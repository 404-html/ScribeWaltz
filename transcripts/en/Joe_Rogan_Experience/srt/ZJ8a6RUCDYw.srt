00:00:02,220 --> 00:00:06,720
The joe rogan experience podcast is
brought to you by several uncomfortable

2
00:00:06,721 --> 00:00:11,340
things. The first one to talk about when
the strange people that you don't know.

3
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:13,830
Steve Ronell's here, I don't even
know this dude, hardly I and an end.

4
00:00:13,831 --> 00:00:17,220
I enjoy your show and I'm going to
have to talk about fake vaginas because

5
00:00:17,221 --> 00:00:20,070
that's one of our sponsors.
One of our sponsors is the flashlight,

6
00:00:20,610 --> 00:00:24,810
the number one sex toy for men.
We've heard it was a really close race,

7
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:30,000
but we don't know who number two is.
You go to Joe rogan.net.

8
00:00:30,001 --> 00:00:33,180
Click on the link for the flashlight
and you know, I know what you're saying.

9
00:00:33,850 --> 00:00:38,040
Dab My life. Yeah. Number two was a
melon. Say, I don't need that in my life.

10
00:00:38,070 --> 00:00:41,460
I don't know. I'm not in a perverted
person, amount of wicked person,

11
00:00:41,730 --> 00:00:45,330
but you will masturbate. You know you
will. You should masturbate. You know why?

12
00:00:45,331 --> 00:00:48,120
Because life is complicated and
the way the human body's designed,

13
00:00:48,121 --> 00:00:53,121
we're supposed to be breeding at every
possible chance because infant mortality

14
00:00:53,191 --> 00:00:56,250
was so high because people getting
eaten by fucking Jaguars. Okay.

15
00:00:56,430 --> 00:00:58,560
And that's not the world we live in today.

16
00:00:58,561 --> 00:01:00,930
So in order to navigate
through this world,

17
00:01:00,931 --> 00:01:05,190
you've got to navigate with a body that
essentially has the same DNA as those

18
00:01:05,191 --> 00:01:08,850
crazy monkey people,
dodge and Jaguars from 10,000 years ago.

19
00:01:09,150 --> 00:01:10,590
But that's not you anymore.
Okay.

20
00:01:10,630 --> 00:01:14,130
You live in a complicated society and
you're going to masturbate. So go.

21
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:16,990
I think the number one sex toy
is proudly the blowup doll.

22
00:01:17,050 --> 00:01:19,870
Wouldn't you say that's, what do you
think? What else? No, I mean number one.

23
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:20,713
Number two,
I mean,

24
00:01:20,850 --> 00:01:23,740
what else would people buy it be a
product that we don't know about?

25
00:01:23,741 --> 00:01:26,900
I've seen a bunch of like similar
items. I mean, it's not rocket science.

26
00:01:26,901 --> 00:01:31,570
Gang gets alone, something soft to shoot
loads into. It's not that complicated.

27
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:32,630
Vaseline,

28
00:01:32,630 --> 00:01:35,310
something along those lines.
Anyway, go to Joe Rogan. Dot.

29
00:01:35,311 --> 00:01:38,870
And then click on the link for the
fleshlight entering the code name, Rogan,

30
00:01:38,871 --> 00:01:41,570
and you will get 15% off.
There you go.

31
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:45,710
And it comes in a brown paper thing.
You don't know what the fuck it is.

32
00:01:45,711 --> 00:01:46,420
You don't have to feel it

33
00:01:46,420 --> 00:01:49,810
barest. Hey, are you allowed to say
how much more do these runs? I thought,

34
00:01:49,811 --> 00:01:52,420
I don't know how much they run. I
don't know. We get, we don't get,

35
00:01:52,450 --> 00:01:56,470
we get 'em for free. I think it's
actually, it's less than 169 bucks.

36
00:01:56,471 --> 00:02:01,270
I think I would say $100. Even at
when you're paying $100, she's,

37
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:02,710
you're filming like a creep.
Yeah.

38
00:02:02,990 --> 00:02:03,830
No matter what.
It's a,

39
00:02:03,831 --> 00:02:07,610
it's a stigma that unfortunately is
stuck in our head that masturbation is

40
00:02:07,611 --> 00:02:10,400
somehow another evil and
paying for something,

41
00:02:10,401 --> 00:02:12,950
buying something and then fucking
it. And that's, no, nobody's,

42
00:02:12,951 --> 00:02:15,620
nobody's proud of that.
So it's going to be stigmatized

43
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:18,920
no matter what. Well, you know, as an
example, this just look at a price.

44
00:02:18,921 --> 00:02:21,690
I think we should price it with,
go ahead. Tell him how much, uh,

45
00:02:22,460 --> 00:02:25,580
before that beautiful
coupon code that you have,

46
00:02:26,390 --> 00:02:29,750
you can get Susie diamonds,
vagina for $67 and 96 cents.

47
00:02:29,751 --> 00:02:32,790
Now I don't know if the quality of
the girl changes for the flashlight.

48
00:02:33,190 --> 00:02:35,450
Would you say like Jim and Jim
said different girls? I'm like,

49
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:39,350
if it was only as tight as
their actual vagina. Oh right.

50
00:02:39,470 --> 00:02:41,810
I'm sure that's what they do cause
they mold is no one the inside.

51
00:02:41,811 --> 00:02:44,480
It's got to be a standard core. I
think it's just the outside. Well,

52
00:02:44,481 --> 00:02:48,310
each girl has a different texture inside.
I know that like Hayes,

53
00:02:48,340 --> 00:02:51,630
you know she's got a swirl.
Special blood.

54
00:02:54,770 --> 00:02:57,980
Steven now second guessing why you
should have come on this fucking podcast.

55
00:02:57,981 --> 00:03:00,010
It wait until 10:00 PM this thing started.

56
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:02,080
There's this hot girl.
I've never seen her before,

57
00:03:02,081 --> 00:03:05,020
but her name's Ariel on the fleshlight
sheet. She has her flashlight.

58
00:03:05,050 --> 00:03:06,090
She is beautiful.

59
00:03:06,140 --> 00:03:08,710
Do. There's a billion porno
stars now. There's no way.

60
00:03:09,010 --> 00:03:12,790
They never stopped making them and they
never retire. There's no end there.

61
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:15,100
The rats on a sinking ship.
Anyway,

62
00:03:15,130 --> 00:03:19,630
if you go to [inaudible] dot com
that is our other sponsor, o n n I t,

63
00:03:19,870 --> 00:03:22,270
makers of shroom tech sport.

64
00:03:22,300 --> 00:03:26,220
This is the quarter seps mushrooms
and beef 12 supplemented a,

65
00:03:26,860 --> 00:03:29,770
I know so many people that are on to
that now and been raving about it.

66
00:03:29,771 --> 00:03:32,830
It's great for people that are
like really into endurance work.

67
00:03:32,831 --> 00:03:36,490
If you're doing crossfit class or
taking Jujitsu or something like that,

68
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:39,310
it's an excellent endurance supplement.
Uh,

69
00:03:39,340 --> 00:03:41,890
if you're just hanging around like Brian,
there's no need for it.

70
00:03:42,340 --> 00:03:46,620
Brian, no benefit. I've used
the shroom tech is any of it.

71
00:03:46,690 --> 00:03:50,890
I feel like I don't want to fuck anything
up. You don't want it to like people,

72
00:03:50,891 --> 00:03:55,360
I don't want people to think that I'm
the, you're on the roids right. And I,

73
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:58,520
um, there's another, let's
just leave that right there.

74
00:03:58,521 --> 00:04:00,680
There's another troop technical,
the shroom tech immune.

75
00:04:00,770 --> 00:04:03,650
And the way it's been explained to me
is this one is a really fascinating one

76
00:04:03,651 --> 00:04:07,190
that's great for your immune
system because your immune
system anticipates that

77
00:04:07,191 --> 00:04:08,750
this live organism is mushroom,

78
00:04:08,751 --> 00:04:12,410
has been eaten by the body and for
whatever reason interprets it as a bug,

79
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:16,400
interprets it as a cold so it fires up
your immune system for attack that never

80
00:04:16,401 --> 00:04:17,680
comes. So, uh,

81
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:21,920
it's a really interesting supplement
just for your immune system,

82
00:04:21,921 --> 00:04:24,920
which in these terrible times of colds,
especially when you're traveling, right?

83
00:04:24,921 --> 00:04:29,900
Brian pump up your immune system.
We're also a makers of new mood,

84
00:04:29,901 --> 00:04:31,580
which is a five HTP.

85
00:04:31,581 --> 00:04:36,050
And L tryptofan supplement that is a
serotonin booster gives you a nice little

86
00:04:36,051 --> 00:04:38,990
boost, makes people feel
very happy. And uh, you know,

87
00:04:38,991 --> 00:04:42,140
I have friends that are on the
five HTP and they were also taking

88
00:04:42,141 --> 00:04:45,570
antidepressants and their doctors
told them literally Neil Brown,

89
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:49,130
his doctor told them to stop taking the
five HTP because it's basically like

90
00:04:49,131 --> 00:04:53,510
you're taking two antidepressants. Isn't
that nuts? The doctor would tell you,

91
00:04:53,660 --> 00:04:55,550
stop taking this nutritional supplement.

92
00:04:55,610 --> 00:04:59,870
It's a supplement that's
available everywhere at
fucking Gnc, at cvs pharmacy.

93
00:04:59,871 --> 00:05:01,520
It's available everywhere.
It's so you just buy it.

94
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:05,840
Stop taking that and get this crazy
prescription shit that rewires your dome.

95
00:05:06,380 --> 00:05:11,380
Get this pill that lets you except your
mundane reality and not be depressed.

96
00:05:11,630 --> 00:05:13,550
Sometimes you should be fucking depressed.
All right.

97
00:05:13,551 --> 00:05:15,320
I know there's people out
there that are unbalanced,

98
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:18,950
but there's people out there depressed
simply because of the environment that

99
00:05:18,951 --> 00:05:23,080
they exist. And on a daily basis, the
stimulation over and over against sucks.

100
00:05:23,750 --> 00:05:26,360
And this pill's not going to help that
and just tell you right now you've got to

101
00:05:26,361 --> 00:05:27,194
get your shit together.

102
00:05:27,810 --> 00:05:30,880
Should we talked about last week,
by the way? I got an answer.

103
00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:35,590
There was a contamination
in Japan. Wow. Wow. Back.

104
00:05:35,620 --> 00:05:39,150
But that's not related to the
nuclear contamination. No, I didn't.

105
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:41,640
I don't think so. I think that's
carrying the fuck out of me. Yeah,

106
00:05:41,770 --> 00:05:44,950
we've got to get to that. We'll talk to
that Steve. Or ready to live in the woods.

107
00:05:44,951 --> 00:05:49,200
Do it. He's prepared. This is mother
fucker can survive out there. Um,

108
00:05:49,570 --> 00:05:53,680
we also make Alpha brain at [inaudible]
dot com Alpha brain is the controversial

109
00:05:53,681 --> 00:05:57,190
yet effective cognitive
enhancing supplement, as always,

110
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:58,820
with all on it products.

111
00:05:58,821 --> 00:06:01,580
The number one concern is that you don't
feel like you're getting ripped off.

112
00:06:01,581 --> 00:06:05,000
So here's how we make it as
easy as possible. First of all,

113
00:06:05,090 --> 00:06:09,040
if you buy it and you don't like, it's
a hundred percent money back guarantee,

114
00:06:09,110 --> 00:06:13,070
you don't even have to return the product.
If you buy it and you don't like it,

115
00:06:13,340 --> 00:06:18,080
just tell us and you get your money back.
So that simple. And then on top of that,

116
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:22,250
I encourage you, first of all, before
you ever take any sort of a nootropic,

117
00:06:23,030 --> 00:06:26,870
essentially vitamins and nutrients
that aid your brain function.

118
00:06:26,900 --> 00:06:30,740
Just go Google it. Go. It's so
easy to do. It's free. Go Google.

119
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:33,500
Read all the different studies,
draw your own conclusions.

120
00:06:33,501 --> 00:06:36,590
There's a bunch of different proprietary
blends other than ours that are

121
00:06:36,591 --> 00:06:39,860
available. And I've tried a couple. If
I tried neuro one, I really liked that.

122
00:06:40,250 --> 00:06:43,220
That set a football player.
What does that guy's name,

123
00:06:43,221 --> 00:06:45,860
the big Roman [inaudible] I think.
I believe it's his,

124
00:06:45,861 --> 00:06:49,130
cause he's a guy's a had some issues
with concussions and stuff like that.

125
00:06:49,131 --> 00:06:53,870
So He created this, uh, this nutrient
rich stuff for your brain. Gay.

126
00:06:53,871 --> 00:06:55,220
I encourage people to try that.

127
00:06:55,221 --> 00:06:58,580
Try to steal our recipe by
the stuff in bulk and copy it.

128
00:06:58,581 --> 00:07:03,350
I am way more concerned with you not
feeling ripped off then you buying any of

129
00:07:03,351 --> 00:07:06,530
our shit.
But if you do want to buy our shit,

130
00:07:06,531 --> 00:07:11,531
it's at [inaudible] dot com o n n I t
use the code named Rogan and you'll get

131
00:07:11,930 --> 00:07:15,290
10% off. All right, that's it. Let's
get fucking crazy. Steve Ronell's here.

132
00:07:15,291 --> 00:07:16,280
We're going to break shit down.

133
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:20,810
We're going to figure out how to eat
or on animals. My head's really now,

134
00:07:20,811 --> 00:07:23,660
but all the supplements I
can be carried trying my day.

135
00:07:23,780 --> 00:07:26,410
Joe Rogan podcast all day.

136
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:34,010
Do you take any supplements or you just
out there and fucking eaten game every

137
00:07:34,010 --> 00:07:34,310
day?

138
00:07:34,310 --> 00:07:35,210
I really don't,
but you know,

139
00:07:35,211 --> 00:07:40,211
I do cause I mean I drink coffee half
the day and then stop for a minute and

140
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:44,990
then at night I'll tend to have a few
drinks or a couple, you know, depending.

141
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:46,900
So I guess in all,
you know,

142
00:07:46,970 --> 00:07:51,180
I'm constantly feeling that I'm feeling
this way and I wish I was feeling more

143
00:07:51,181 --> 00:07:55,760
of that way. Like more awake
or more tired. Well the
coffee's not going to help,

144
00:07:55,790 --> 00:07:57,500
boy, when you know it does
it. Cause I'd take that,

145
00:07:57,501 --> 00:07:59,490
I'd take that and I take that for a nap.

146
00:08:00,330 --> 00:08:03,360
This guy on Daniel Bolelli and he had
the smartest thing to say about coffee.

147
00:08:03,361 --> 00:08:06,270
He said, I use it like a hard
drug. He goes, I don't take it.

148
00:08:06,450 --> 00:08:09,690
But then when I have to take it when
I'm really tired and I needed like the

149
00:08:09,691 --> 00:08:12,480
stamp to write a paper or something
and he was like, then I take it, boom.

150
00:08:12,481 --> 00:08:13,470
I'm just wired,

151
00:08:13,740 --> 00:08:16,770
whereas I got to a point where I could
drink a cup of coffee and just go to

152
00:08:16,771 --> 00:08:17,520
sleep.

153
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:21,570
Oh, for sure. And you could
do that, right? Yeah. But it
wasn't like that at a time,

154
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:25,140
you know? Now it just seems like kind
of honestly, it seems like a hot,

155
00:08:25,141 --> 00:08:29,460
smelly drink. No, I don't know. I'm always
like, for instance, before doing this,

156
00:08:29,461 --> 00:08:31,320
I was like, I should go get a
cup of coffee. Yeah, me too.

157
00:08:31,321 --> 00:08:35,520
I haven't looked for a Starbucks. If I
have access to it, I want it all the time.

158
00:08:35,740 --> 00:08:39,120
If I'm out, like if we're on the field
and, or I'm camping or something,

159
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:42,180
I might make a little thing of instant
coffee in the morning and never think of

160
00:08:42,181 --> 00:08:45,900
it the rest of the day. But it
just has to do with, I don't know,

161
00:08:45,901 --> 00:08:50,070
man of force of habit. Yeah. I almost
hate it. I almost hate it about myself,

162
00:08:50,071 --> 00:08:53,730
but no, I don't take as far as any
actual supplements go, I don't,

163
00:08:54,150 --> 00:08:59,040
I tend to be a skeptic
about things that no, no,

164
00:08:59,041 --> 00:08:59,660
I don't.

165
00:08:59,660 --> 00:09:03,830
Hmm. Well, uh, I was a skeptic about
vitamins and supplements and start toy.

166
00:09:03,831 --> 00:09:06,800
I looked into them and also I looked
into the fact that the government's been

167
00:09:06,801 --> 00:09:08,240
trying to restrict him for a long time.

168
00:09:08,241 --> 00:09:11,490
They were going to make them
available only through prescriptions.

169
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:12,950
Then we got to call them nutriceuticals.

170
00:09:12,951 --> 00:09:15,320
It was some deal that they were with
pharmaceutical companies because

171
00:09:15,370 --> 00:09:18,320
pharmaceutical company is going, so that
fucking money we can be making boys.

172
00:09:18,321 --> 00:09:21,290
What's going on? Capitol Hill Hook us up.
We're getting you an office. What's up?

173
00:09:21,530 --> 00:09:25,160
So they came up with this ridiculous
idea that they were gonna make vitamins

174
00:09:25,161 --> 00:09:25,581
available.

175
00:09:25,581 --> 00:09:28,670
Only imagine if you had to go to a
fucking doctor to get a multivitamin.

176
00:09:28,671 --> 00:09:32,690
How pissed he would be. Like, it's
just nonsense. Just more regulations,

177
00:09:32,691 --> 00:09:36,870
more big business. You fuck heads,
you get a prescription for carriers.

178
00:09:37,250 --> 00:09:39,890
But there's a,
there's real science behind vitamins.

179
00:09:39,891 --> 00:09:42,320
There's a real science
behind the, uh, the, the,

180
00:09:42,350 --> 00:09:46,730
all the work that's been done to figure
out like, which vitamins enhance, which,

181
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:50,690
you know, what's good for vision, what's
good for muscular endurance. So, you know,

182
00:09:50,691 --> 00:09:53,360
what gives you energy be 12. Why
is that? Let's find out. I mean,

183
00:09:53,361 --> 00:09:56,660
there's supplements are real.
They're legit. You know,

184
00:09:56,690 --> 00:10:00,200
B 12 is a fabulous energy supplement.
It's in everything. People take it.

185
00:10:00,201 --> 00:10:01,520
I know people had taken shots.

186
00:10:01,521 --> 00:10:04,190
They go to a place every week at
clinic and get a beat. 12 shot.

187
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:08,480
It's been 12 the one that only comes
through animal protein, animal protein,

188
00:10:08,481 --> 00:10:11,320
but animal products in some way.
I do believe that's it.

189
00:10:11,350 --> 00:10:14,530
I remember guys saying that lecture, let
me, let's, let's, let's find that out.

190
00:10:14,531 --> 00:10:15,880
Because people would say,

191
00:10:16,390 --> 00:10:20,890
people would say that you
can't be vegetarian because
be 12 I remember reading,

192
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:25,300
I think it was B 12 that you get
enough B12 from insect contamination.

193
00:10:25,540 --> 00:10:28,060
Holy Shit.
On produce to stay alive.

194
00:10:28,530 --> 00:10:32,280
Yeah. B12 only in animal foods.
President only in animal foods.

195
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:36,200
Like if you don't like wash every
single fold and a cabbage leaf,

196
00:10:36,230 --> 00:10:37,350
you're going to get 12

197
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:40,480
yeah. I saw some fucking
crazy statistic online to the,

198
00:10:40,900 --> 00:10:42,820
the pounds of bugs,

199
00:10:43,060 --> 00:10:47,020
bug parts that a human being and living
in a city will eat over the course of

200
00:10:47,021 --> 00:10:51,250
their life. It's mind boggling.
It's like several pounds like bag.

201
00:10:51,490 --> 00:10:55,610
Oh Helen's of bug parts. If you eat out
of my garden at my house. I mean it's,

202
00:10:55,990 --> 00:10:58,840
it's almost kind of ridiculous but I
don't even like eat around it so much

203
00:10:58,841 --> 00:11:01,450
anymore. You know when I watched
your show, the wild with it,

204
00:11:01,451 --> 00:11:03,730
I thought it was really interesting
that you live in the city,

205
00:11:03,940 --> 00:11:06,130
you live in it like you were
living in Brooklyn, right.

206
00:11:06,490 --> 00:11:09,370
And yet you were doing the show when
you're out in the fucking woods.

207
00:11:09,371 --> 00:11:11,050
Like if you know how cool it is out there,

208
00:11:11,051 --> 00:11:15,100
why would you want to live in
Brooklyn? I when, when I met,

209
00:11:15,330 --> 00:11:20,330
it's oddly my first date with my wife
was a four day date here in Los Angeles.

210
00:11:21,161 --> 00:11:25,120
At the time I was living in Alaska
and even when I asked her out,

211
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:29,860
I had to call her on a satellite
phone from the north slope of,

212
00:11:29,870 --> 00:11:33,650
of the Brooks range where I was and
she was in New York and I asked her,

213
00:11:33,651 --> 00:11:35,890
oh cause I had met her through work,
through book publishing.

214
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:40,540
So we started dating,
we had our four day date.

215
00:11:41,260 --> 00:11:44,860
I went back to Alaska and I made a bet
there with a guy named Matt Carlson.

216
00:11:44,861 --> 00:11:47,500
I said, I bet you a hundred
bucks, I'll marry that girl.

217
00:11:48,250 --> 00:11:52,690
And he called bullshit on that
and I want to win the bet.

218
00:11:53,350 --> 00:11:56,920
But I think that largely
just to win that bet, um,

219
00:11:56,950 --> 00:11:59,160
to win that hunter barks,
you know,

220
00:11:59,170 --> 00:12:02,710
I want up getting married
and moving in with my wife.

221
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:09,220
That was like a big part of
your motivation. Real. It
ain't no, no, no, I'm joking.

222
00:12:09,221 --> 00:12:12,760
But yeah, so she, she works in book
publishing and we met that way.

223
00:12:13,510 --> 00:12:16,840
I'm gone now maybe half the time,
but yeah, I spend half my time there.

224
00:12:17,030 --> 00:12:17,863
MMM.

225
00:12:18,930 --> 00:12:20,460
It's complete living there.

226
00:12:20,490 --> 00:12:23,040
I grew up in Michigan and
lived in Montana for 10 years,

227
00:12:23,041 --> 00:12:27,960
but living in New York has changed
everything. I thought I knew,

228
00:12:28,740 --> 00:12:31,680
you know, and I realized in a big way. Um,

229
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:35,970
I tend to think kind of whatever,
everyone around me doesn't think.

230
00:12:36,510 --> 00:12:38,970
So when I lived in Montana,
I attended,

231
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:44,040
I would find myself having views on things
that would skew leftward cause I was

232
00:12:45,541 --> 00:12:49,900
responding to a strong, right. You
have like a natural contrarian.

233
00:12:50,340 --> 00:12:55,260
So now being in New York has made me,
I'm a lot,

234
00:12:55,350 --> 00:12:56,161
I'm kind of,

235
00:12:56,161 --> 00:13:00,690
if you picture like an old
man who fought and you know,

236
00:13:00,691 --> 00:13:04,530
World War Two and like yelled
at kids who come on his yard,

237
00:13:04,570 --> 00:13:07,650
I'm kind of becoming like
that from being there.

238
00:13:07,651 --> 00:13:11,810
It's had such a profound effect on me, you
know, cause I had, I not good. Right? No,

239
00:13:11,820 --> 00:13:14,700
I like it. I enjoy it. I like you like
to come with that guy. You know what?

240
00:13:14,970 --> 00:13:16,410
Because it's such a fresh perspective.

241
00:13:17,130 --> 00:13:18,990
Every day I wake up and I
see the world in a new way.

242
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:24,330
I see it through the eyes of a mean old
man. Oh that's hilarious. So, but no,

243
00:13:24,331 --> 00:13:28,170
we're there now and I
can't at all complaining.

244
00:13:28,171 --> 00:13:31,440
It's the thing that people bring up most
off. Like how can you live there? Um,

245
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:38,500
I go out now and I still have great
friends and contacts and then you know,

246
00:13:38,750 --> 00:13:43,040
wild places and we'd go and hang out and
do wild stuff and I'll pack up a cooler

247
00:13:43,041 --> 00:13:45,080
full of whatever we've been chasing,
game meat.

248
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:49,340
And I go back to my house and I have
a very pleasant existence there.

249
00:13:49,341 --> 00:13:53,600
We have a young boy, it's just fun
and it and it feels more like, um,

250
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:55,710
okay.

251
00:13:55,710 --> 00:13:56,980
Kind of like emerge, you know, like,

252
00:13:57,120 --> 00:14:00,810
like going out into the wild woolly
then like kind of coming back and

253
00:14:00,811 --> 00:14:03,030
decompressing.
If I didn't,

254
00:14:03,060 --> 00:14:08,060
if I wasn't involved in the line of work
where I would travel so much time and

255
00:14:09,331 --> 00:14:13,590
get to see such great wilderness areas
and do such cool stuff, it would,

256
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:17,580
it would bother me more. But you can
buy travel so much. Yeah, it's just,

257
00:14:17,581 --> 00:14:21,510
it's fun and cool. If I, if I
wasn't doing what I'm doing now,

258
00:14:21,511 --> 00:14:24,270
I would probably have to, I would
probably have to split, you know,

259
00:14:24,271 --> 00:14:25,470
I'd probably wouldn't be able to go there,

260
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:28,830
but in a way I'll always like
when I'm long gone from there,

261
00:14:29,010 --> 00:14:33,510
I'll always look back at being in New
York as very educational because when you

262
00:14:33,511 --> 00:14:35,770
look, I think all of
this all the time, like,

263
00:14:35,790 --> 00:14:39,600
like grown where I grew up in semi-rural,
Michigan or live in places,

264
00:14:40,020 --> 00:14:45,020
it's hard to drive down the road and
imagine all the things that drive like

265
00:14:47,070 --> 00:14:50,450
global enterprise and global politics.
Cause you Kinda,

266
00:14:50,470 --> 00:14:55,470
you can't really out who around me would
care enough about these things to make

267
00:14:55,701 --> 00:14:57,440
these happen.
Like for instance,

268
00:14:57,500 --> 00:15:01,520
like I can't drive down a road in
Michigan and be like, Oh that's why we're,

269
00:15:01,790 --> 00:15:05,600
that's why we invaded Iraq. You know what
mean? It's like, right, you don't see,

270
00:15:06,790 --> 00:15:09,500
you know where things are going.
But in New York you kind of go like,

271
00:15:09,530 --> 00:15:14,150
oh that's why, that's that way. That's
why the movies that get made are,

272
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:19,280
that's why they get made or that's why
what's on TV is on TV or that's why the

273
00:15:19,281 --> 00:15:23,120
books I read are the books I read cause
these are the people that you know are

274
00:15:23,121 --> 00:15:24,590
doing all this and it gives,

275
00:15:24,620 --> 00:15:29,620
it just like helps me more understand why
America kind of looks like American as

276
00:15:30,381 --> 00:15:31,310
much as people

277
00:15:32,350 --> 00:15:33,080
yeah.

278
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:36,170
In the U s tend to want to look at like,

279
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:41,200
like New York or la as being this
like weird otherness in a big way.

280
00:15:41,390 --> 00:15:45,530
I just find that it's more,
it's more of an accurate portrayal of,

281
00:15:45,590 --> 00:15:48,920
of culture than you'd ever think because
that's where so much culture is getting

282
00:15:48,921 --> 00:15:52,130
produced. And I never really picked
up on this living in other places.

283
00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:53,240
I don't know if I'm making any sense.

284
00:15:53,460 --> 00:15:56,730
You're totally making sense. Brian. Is
there something wrong with this mic?

285
00:15:56,731 --> 00:15:59,370
It keeps, it's like it dropped
off. Something happened.

286
00:15:59,460 --> 00:16:03,330
It's just if you're really loud. Oh,
it's a got a regulator on it. Yeah.

287
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:05,580
You got some new crafty
technology going on here. No,

288
00:16:05,590 --> 00:16:10,230
it's been on there for awhile.
You're making complete total
sense. Um, I, you know,

289
00:16:10,231 --> 00:16:13,710
I always say that humanity is
what it is at its potential.

290
00:16:13,711 --> 00:16:16,440
What is potential best or
potential worst and the,

291
00:16:16,490 --> 00:16:20,070
what you see in New York is how,
I mean there's some,

292
00:16:20,130 --> 00:16:22,380
there's a community to New York for sure.
You know,

293
00:16:22,390 --> 00:16:25,860
there's definitely a closeness to
the people there and you, you really,

294
00:16:25,870 --> 00:16:28,500
there was really
accentuated after nine 11.

295
00:16:28,501 --> 00:16:32,490
I remember I went to New York really
shortly after nine 11 and everybody was

296
00:16:32,491 --> 00:16:36,240
like really friendly and it was like
really a profound difference from the way

297
00:16:36,241 --> 00:16:37,860
people were communicating
with each other when I,

298
00:16:37,890 --> 00:16:39,240
when I lived there at one point in time.

299
00:16:39,780 --> 00:16:44,780
And I think it's because just naturally
human beings are not designed to live

300
00:16:45,001 --> 00:16:49,590
like that.
That is just an alien form of tribe.

301
00:16:49,710 --> 00:16:50,580
That's ridiculous.

302
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:55,600
Did the amount of input that comes into
a person on a daily basis is way more

303
00:16:56,431 --> 00:17:00,560
than the body is designed for and we're
just assuming that we can take it and it

304
00:17:00,780 --> 00:17:02,340
shows time and time again.

305
00:17:02,341 --> 00:17:05,460
All these fucking people died of heart
attacks when they're in their 50s no, no,

306
00:17:05,461 --> 00:17:07,470
we're not taking it.
We're not taking it well at all.

307
00:17:07,471 --> 00:17:11,430
This is not best case scenario for
the human body. It's very stimulating.

308
00:17:11,431 --> 00:17:15,600
It's very crazy.
But all the behavior aspects of it,

309
00:17:15,601 --> 00:17:17,730
all the problems,
all the things that people do wrong,

310
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:22,000
it's all been demonstrated in rat
population density studies. Yeah.

311
00:17:22,050 --> 00:17:25,920
They've done those tasks where they have
a couple rats in a big pan and the rats

312
00:17:25,921 --> 00:17:27,240
are cool with each other,
but he's fine.

313
00:17:27,450 --> 00:17:31,050
And then they slowly jam him up until
the point where rats become crazy.

314
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:34,680
They're sitting in the corner, Buck and
back and forth. They kill other rats.

315
00:17:35,130 --> 00:17:37,650
Chaos goes on.
I mean it's really what it is.

316
00:17:37,651 --> 00:17:41,040
It's like either there's too much fucking
stimulation and there's not enough

317
00:17:41,041 --> 00:17:43,080
resources, too much
stimulation, but there's not.

318
00:17:43,110 --> 00:17:46,290
But I think beyond the stimulation,
so you don't have a lot of, uh,

319
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:47,690
okay.

320
00:17:47,690 --> 00:17:52,140
Like I could probably handle a lot of
stimulation of my own choosing, you know,

321
00:17:52,380 --> 00:17:55,170
but it was a lot of stimulation
that's not of your own choosing. So,

322
00:17:55,171 --> 00:17:57,040
I mean you're being bombarded
by things like, like,

323
00:17:57,650 --> 00:17:59,610
like if there was some way to like add up,

324
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:02,640
like if there's some way to
quantify stimulation and like units,

325
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:05,340
if I'm picking my subjects,

326
00:18:05,810 --> 00:18:08,730
like I might pick a tremendous amount
in a given day. Like I'd be like,

327
00:18:08,731 --> 00:18:10,740
I'd like to be bombarded
with this much stimulation,

328
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:16,040
but they're 90% of my capacity might be
filled by stuff that I didn't invite or

329
00:18:17,341 --> 00:18:19,230
even want it.
It's just thrown at you.

330
00:18:19,340 --> 00:18:24,000
It's to the point where I,
when I started hanging around there,

331
00:18:24,001 --> 00:18:27,510
I did it very reluctantly. And at the
time I didn't even, I didn't have a home.

332
00:18:27,540 --> 00:18:31,500
I have two brothers and one's in Montana,
ones in Alaska and they both,

333
00:18:32,010 --> 00:18:34,170
when this is all going on, you
know, six, seven years ago,

334
00:18:34,171 --> 00:18:37,770
whatever they were in that
situation where they had, you know,

335
00:18:37,771 --> 00:18:40,920
they were making money, like they
were out of school and making money,

336
00:18:40,921 --> 00:18:44,640
but they didn't have a wife to tell them
really how to spend it yet, you know,

337
00:18:44,641 --> 00:18:48,540
so they had like nice houses that were
empty and I could just live in their

338
00:18:48,541 --> 00:18:50,310
homes.
And so I live Tanner,

339
00:18:50,311 --> 00:18:53,160
I live with my brothers and they thought
they were like patrons of the arts,

340
00:18:53,161 --> 00:18:53,940
you know,
to have,

341
00:18:53,940 --> 00:18:56,520
they have this writer brother and he's
sometimes lives in the basement or

342
00:18:56,521 --> 00:18:58,320
sometimes he's off doing whatever he does.

343
00:18:59,070 --> 00:19:04,070
And when I came to New York and started
being at my girlfriends and I would come

344
00:19:04,801 --> 00:19:06,510
for a few weeks or
whatever amount of time,

345
00:19:06,750 --> 00:19:10,770
we both recognize that something was wrong
for being there to the point where we

346
00:19:10,771 --> 00:19:15,120
would say, Oh, if we get married, we
would of course move somewhere else.

347
00:19:15,660 --> 00:19:17,820
And then it became, we got
married, they'd be like,

348
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:22,410
well once she's pregnant we would
of course move somewhere else.

349
00:19:22,740 --> 00:19:24,210
And then she got pregnant and it's like,

350
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:27,180
well by the time the baby is
born we will of course split.

351
00:19:27,810 --> 00:19:32,340
And now maybe by the time he's
five we're supposed to split.

352
00:19:32,830 --> 00:19:36,640
He's a year and a half right now. But
it's like we know every day we wake up,

353
00:19:36,641 --> 00:19:39,540
we're like, something isn't
like there's some thing that we,

354
00:19:39,550 --> 00:19:44,190
there's some reason that this really
easy to stay very hard to leave really

355
00:19:44,230 --> 00:19:48,610
cause of work. Man, she has like
a good job. I have, you know,

356
00:19:48,730 --> 00:19:50,680
I'm busy with various projects.

357
00:19:50,710 --> 00:19:53,590
It's really hard and when you see so much
of the country suffering and we should

358
00:19:53,610 --> 00:19:56,350
tell everybody about your new show
before we even go to meet eater.

359
00:19:56,351 --> 00:19:58,540
It's on when it's on Sundays,

360
00:19:58,570 --> 00:20:03,220
9:00 PM on sportsman channel and you
can probably find it just by looking at

361
00:20:03,221 --> 00:20:05,700
meat or in a search. That's the
best way to find shows. You know,

362
00:20:05,710 --> 00:20:08,420
fucking find the sportsman channel.
What channel is that? Okay,

363
00:20:08,690 --> 00:20:11,180
well somebody got the other channels
like I don't know what comedy central has

364
00:20:11,470 --> 00:20:16,370
no idea what channels already be eight
and 13 but people really know ABC,

365
00:20:16,371 --> 00:20:19,630
NBC, CBS. You'd be like, it's not
in three, right? Yeah, I remember,

366
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:23,270
I remember channel seven was ABC.
Yeah, I totally, that's all gone.

367
00:20:23,271 --> 00:20:25,640
I don't know what any channel is.
I just look for the shows. No.

368
00:20:25,641 --> 00:20:26,301
Yeah I have no idea.

369
00:20:26,301 --> 00:20:31,301
I found out the PBS is 13 cause my boy
likes to watch a little Elmo now and then

370
00:20:32,540 --> 00:20:36,350
and that's the only one I know by number.
But no, it's on sportsman channel.

371
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:40,520
Sunday nights, 9:00 PM.
Um, it's available widely

372
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:46,490
often to premium channel. Is it also
available on iTunes and stuff like that?

373
00:20:46,491 --> 00:20:48,830
If people, it will be though
we've only been, you know,

374
00:20:48,850 --> 00:20:50,440
we've only been Erin for three weeks,

375
00:20:50,441 --> 00:20:54,130
but that episodes will eventually be
available across a variety of formats.

376
00:20:54,131 --> 00:20:57,070
But right now that's where it is right
now on. I was a big fan of your show,

377
00:20:57,310 --> 00:21:00,310
the wild within. I really enjoyed
that show man. That was great.

378
00:21:00,311 --> 00:21:01,610
I loved the one when you,
uh,

379
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:05,920
when across the country and like tried
to live like Lewis and Clark and shot a

380
00:21:05,921 --> 00:21:10,570
buffalo with a musket and shit. Like the
whole deal. I was like, wow. Like this is,

381
00:21:10,770 --> 00:21:14,480
this is a fun show.
Bombed out has been huge into um,

382
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:19,510
I've always been huge into that Lewis
and Clark idea and in that one to nutty

383
00:21:19,511 --> 00:21:22,990
fucking idea, man. Dude. But the thing,

384
00:21:23,050 --> 00:21:25,920
here's the thing I dig about Lewis and
Clark and you'll, you'll appreciate this.

385
00:21:25,921 --> 00:21:30,130
We were just talking about New York
so much, but like Lewis and Clark,

386
00:21:30,370 --> 00:21:32,110
so early 18 hundreds you know,

387
00:21:32,290 --> 00:21:36,880
they split out of Saint Louis and they
go over the two year journey, you know,

388
00:21:36,881 --> 00:21:41,800
go all the way to the Pacific and come
back and there's places along that route

389
00:21:41,801 --> 00:21:44,880
there. Now of course towns, you know, and
I've lived in a number of, in Bozeman,

390
00:21:44,890 --> 00:21:45,820
Montana,
Missoula,

391
00:21:45,821 --> 00:21:49,270
Montana where they wandered through and
now it just looks like a town and people

392
00:21:49,271 --> 00:21:52,420
live there. There's a lot of
places they went, for instance,

393
00:21:52,421 --> 00:21:56,950
this place called the Missouri breaks
where nothing ever happened there again,

394
00:21:57,580 --> 00:22:00,520
you know, and you can go to New York
and in some of them might be like, oh,

395
00:22:00,521 --> 00:22:03,310
you know what right here,
like John Lennon got shot right here.

396
00:22:04,300 --> 00:22:08,050
It doesn't feel like Andy because so many
other layers of things have happened.

397
00:22:08,470 --> 00:22:08,921
You know what I mean?

398
00:22:08,921 --> 00:22:13,430
Like other people died there and
people got arrested there and you know,

399
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:17,290
people built houses there and tore up
the sidewalk and made a new sidewalk and

400
00:22:17,291 --> 00:22:19,420
it winds up being an after awhile.
It becomes,

401
00:22:19,780 --> 00:22:21,730
it's worse than being buried by years.

402
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:23,860
It's just been buried
by layers of experience.

403
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:26,300
But we're floating on a Missouri breaks.
When I,

404
00:22:26,740 --> 00:22:29,020
before I even thought of
the idea to do that episode,

405
00:22:29,021 --> 00:22:31,810
were flown on a Missouri breaks and
I was with a writer friend of mine.

406
00:22:31,810 --> 00:22:32,770
I was kind of a mentor of mine,

407
00:22:32,771 --> 00:22:37,030
he and Frazier and we're laying there
in the spot where we knew they can't

408
00:22:37,031 --> 00:22:40,090
because it's in her journals.
They described these camp
spots. He's like, no one,

409
00:22:40,120 --> 00:22:44,380
like basically they were here and then
a couple hundred years went by and now

410
00:22:44,381 --> 00:22:47,440
we're here and you can see it. You just
look at the ground and it'd be like,

411
00:22:47,740 --> 00:22:50,600
you might find like one of their tools,
someone, yeah. Something was like,

412
00:22:50,740 --> 00:22:55,460
it's possible to feel history in a,

413
00:22:55,870 --> 00:22:58,130
in a more immediate way. And that's
not even old history. I mean,

414
00:22:58,131 --> 00:23:01,010
you imagine like there's bars in England.
Yeah.

415
00:23:01,350 --> 00:23:06,350
If it had been open continuously longer
than it's been since Lewis apart went

416
00:23:07,031 --> 00:23:11,440
out west. So everything like in, in,
in, in the western US old is not old.

417
00:23:11,500 --> 00:23:15,490
Old as only Olin comparison.
Yeah. Yeah. Only old relative,

418
00:23:15,610 --> 00:23:16,990
but that's why I always did that stuff.

419
00:23:16,990 --> 00:23:18,930
And I've always had a
real penchant for like,

420
00:23:19,060 --> 00:23:23,770
like just going to archaeological
sites where maybe it's just a lack of

421
00:23:23,771 --> 00:23:24,604
imagination.

422
00:23:24,610 --> 00:23:27,670
But if I can look and there's still some
little stone shards laying underground,

423
00:23:28,270 --> 00:23:30,320
I'm like, this I can
relate to. If you, you,

424
00:23:30,430 --> 00:23:34,590
I'm sure you've found arrowheads and shit,
that's pretty cool. I found a number,

425
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:34,940
arrowheads,

426
00:23:34,940 --> 00:23:39,940
but the problem is getting into arrowheads
is you get into a level of kind of

427
00:23:41,021 --> 00:23:43,660
sewer ship where the
only really cool stuff,

428
00:23:43,661 --> 00:23:47,730
it's like the ice age stuff
like Folsom, Clovis. Uh,

429
00:23:47,731 --> 00:23:52,100
so now like once I started
getting into seeing him,

430
00:23:52,490 --> 00:23:55,580
I got in my mind that the
real one would be this.

431
00:23:55,610 --> 00:23:58,040
And so now I'm perpetually
dissatisfied because you don't find,

432
00:23:58,680 --> 00:24:01,550
I found the arrowhead. I'm African. You
have to find them yourself. Correct.

433
00:24:01,551 --> 00:24:05,420
It's not, it doesn't mean shit. If you
go buy one on Ebay and you know it's,

434
00:24:05,450 --> 00:24:08,660
you know what buying them on Ebay is
almost better than when the dude next to

435
00:24:08,661 --> 00:24:10,490
you find someone.
We're just filming.

436
00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:15,260
We were filming a meat eater episode
in Arizona and I'm down on my hands and

437
00:24:15,261 --> 00:24:20,261
knees scouring in outside this cave
entrance for stone charts and we had,

438
00:24:22,611 --> 00:24:24,490
just for the moment we had this double,

439
00:24:24,550 --> 00:24:27,910
a kid that works on this ranch came out
and see what was going on and he's kind

440
00:24:27,911 --> 00:24:30,170
of like wondering why I'm doing this.
And he's like,

441
00:24:30,171 --> 00:24:31,190
well here's the arrowhead right there.

442
00:24:31,420 --> 00:24:33,800
And it was the only Arrow had we found
and he just picked that thing up.

443
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:38,230
I'm kind of cursing it.
I find chunks, you know,

444
00:24:38,300 --> 00:24:41,180
and we call them shards or if you
want to get even more technical,

445
00:24:41,181 --> 00:24:44,930
they call him a lithic remains
or something like that.

446
00:24:45,380 --> 00:24:47,900
This little bits of stone,
you wouldn't even know if he saw it.

447
00:24:47,930 --> 00:24:51,770
But to me it's like I have a
pile of Matt home basically.

448
00:24:51,770 --> 00:24:55,580
It'd be like if you're whittling a stick,
I find the little chunks,

449
00:24:55,640 --> 00:24:58,340
the flight and I never
find the sharp stared.

450
00:24:58,550 --> 00:25:00,440
And how do you know that
that's how they're created.

451
00:25:00,441 --> 00:25:04,160
It wasn't just like something falling on
something and there's a thing called a

452
00:25:04,161 --> 00:25:07,010
can coital fracture.
I may be pronouncing it first.

453
00:25:07,011 --> 00:25:09,220
And that's how they create the Ed.
Yeah.

454
00:25:09,230 --> 00:25:13,340
It winds up being that it just doesn't
get replicated from two rocks banging

455
00:25:13,341 --> 00:25:15,140
together. Freezing. Does it replicate it?

456
00:25:15,170 --> 00:25:18,750
It's like a pressure flake
[inaudible] tool stone.

457
00:25:18,751 --> 00:25:21,320
Like we always say like arrowheads are
made out of Flint, like Chert, Flint,

458
00:25:21,321 --> 00:25:24,110
obsidian, personal night,
all these different things.

459
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:29,920
Fracture in a specific way when slow
pressures applied to them and you'll look

460
00:25:30,081 --> 00:25:33,800
and there'll be like a this dome
shape thing on it and it, it's,

461
00:25:33,801 --> 00:25:37,580
it's considered to be,
it's technically diagnostic.

462
00:25:37,820 --> 00:25:41,360
Like you can look at it and you would
be able to say like in the peer reviewed

463
00:25:41,361 --> 00:25:45,550
scientific journal that that is a human
worked stone. Oh, okay. You know, it's,

464
00:25:45,551 --> 00:25:50,090
it's that obvious. I get eight has to be
replicated by repetitive yeah. Shipping.

465
00:25:50,091 --> 00:25:52,940
And they look at it like you'll,
you'll look at it. It's not like, oh,

466
00:25:52,941 --> 00:25:55,960
I think that was, no,
that was uh, you know,

467
00:25:56,060 --> 00:25:59,480
that was a fractured stolen by how long
ago did they first start doing that?

468
00:25:59,540 --> 00:26:04,310
Like, how long did people just shoot
arrows at shit? You know, like when, well,

469
00:26:04,311 --> 00:26:06,110
when was the first bone Arrow?
Do you know?

470
00:26:06,140 --> 00:26:10,130
They say the Bono was invented many times.
Not many times.

471
00:26:11,030 --> 00:26:11,780
I could be wrong,
I'm just,

472
00:26:11,780 --> 00:26:15,410
but the bone marrow may have been invented
six or seven or more times. Really?

473
00:26:15,500 --> 00:26:20,500
No humans first arrived in North America
through Siberia in the Bering land

474
00:26:22,941 --> 00:26:27,770
bridge, maybe, you know,
with big foot maybe 13, 14,

475
00:26:27,771 --> 00:26:30,620
15,000 years ago. Somewhere in
there. It's like, it's hotly debated,

476
00:26:30,621 --> 00:26:32,930
let's say 14,000 years ago
when they arrived here,

477
00:26:32,931 --> 00:26:37,931
they were making very intricate stone
points that were more ornate and technical

478
00:26:39,381 --> 00:26:41,750
and beautiful than things that were
being made thousands of year later.

479
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:45,930
But they didn't have the bow. There's been
more human. His, they were just spears.

480
00:26:46,180 --> 00:26:47,310
Yeah, probably like, uh,

481
00:26:47,340 --> 00:26:52,340
they think that what was in use most
widely may have been an adult ladol like a

482
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:57,330
throwing board. Okay, so a spear with
like a thing that you throw it with. Yeah,

483
00:26:57,331 --> 00:26:59,670
it'd be based,
it's like an extension of your arm.

484
00:26:59,700 --> 00:27:04,700
So it'd be like a board that you can
get more leverage that you see people at

485
00:27:04,741 --> 00:27:07,500
the park throwing for a dog,
like throwing a tennis ball for a dog.

486
00:27:07,740 --> 00:27:11,190
Imagine a contraption like that
that helped you throw a spear. Yeah,

487
00:27:11,191 --> 00:27:12,900
I think I've seen those and
they were, well, you know,

488
00:27:12,901 --> 00:27:16,980
it's the old hippie thing like
old hippie guys, you know,

489
00:27:16,981 --> 00:27:19,530
the kind of like old hippie guy
who would go out, for instance,

490
00:27:19,710 --> 00:27:24,510
he may be like has an old Hippie van
and he likes to nap arrowheads in, in,

491
00:27:24,550 --> 00:27:28,320
in uh, has a lot of feathers and
rocks and stuff on his dashboard.

492
00:27:28,740 --> 00:27:33,560
Those guys would get into adult adults.
Right. I see what you're saying. Now, all,

493
00:27:33,780 --> 00:27:38,460
all ad level guys are not old hippies but,
but it's uh, it's an old hippie thing.

494
00:27:38,490 --> 00:27:42,480
It's not very well known that the same
way playing disc golf, right? Frisbee,

495
00:27:42,481 --> 00:27:44,610
golf or whatever,
where they call that Frisbee Golf.

496
00:27:44,950 --> 00:27:46,920
Like a certain dude plays Frisbee Golf,

497
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:50,490
but not all guys that play Frisbee
golf or those kinds of dudes.

498
00:27:50,670 --> 00:27:52,710
Certain guys play with atlatls.
Yeah.

499
00:27:52,711 --> 00:27:55,170
There's certain people that look
at Frisbee evolve and they just go,

500
00:27:55,171 --> 00:27:58,110
what the fuck man, I'm not doing that.
Yeah, exactly. It's not really my thing.

501
00:27:58,230 --> 00:28:03,230
And so there is more human history
in North America pre then post bone.

502
00:28:05,251 --> 00:28:08,260
So maybe the bone Arrow made the
scene around this for 5,000 years ago.

503
00:28:08,261 --> 00:28:12,300
So the really all throughout the world,
no, no, no, no Justin, I'm north places.

504
00:28:12,301 --> 00:28:13,050
Different Times.

505
00:28:13,050 --> 00:28:16,770
So North American amendment four or five
vans invented or did someone introduce

506
00:28:16,771 --> 00:28:20,700
it or is that not known? It
would have been, and again,

507
00:28:20,701 --> 00:28:22,320
when you start talking about this stuff,
it's,

508
00:28:22,740 --> 00:28:26,600
it's like very informed guesswork,
right?

509
00:28:27,690 --> 00:28:32,690
If the people that arrived here that
migrated into the western hemisphere,

510
00:28:33,820 --> 00:28:35,310
my migrated in North America,

511
00:28:35,580 --> 00:28:39,270
they arrived here without it
and it emerged much later.

512
00:28:39,780 --> 00:28:42,510
You'd have to think did
it emerged independently.

513
00:28:43,080 --> 00:28:46,510
People came here without it
and it developed and they
say, and like I said, I've,

514
00:28:46,560 --> 00:28:47,880
I don't know this for sure,

515
00:28:47,881 --> 00:28:52,881
by red at times that they think the boat
emerged six or seven different times.

516
00:28:53,280 --> 00:28:54,930
Like certain things just get
invented again and again.

517
00:28:54,931 --> 00:28:58,110
And I often like try to think when I
tried to think of whether something's

518
00:28:59,250 --> 00:29:03,660
normal or abnormal or right or
not. Right. I imagine that if you

519
00:29:05,190 --> 00:29:07,200
backed up human history to the beginning,

520
00:29:07,201 --> 00:29:11,460
so let's say you backed it up to like
the African diaspora when when humans

521
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:13,410
first left Africa to populate the world,

522
00:29:13,860 --> 00:29:16,650
if you backed it up and had
everybody do it all over again,

523
00:29:17,970 --> 00:29:20,610
would it happen again?
And I'm like,

524
00:29:20,850 --> 00:29:25,850
wearing your pants down around
your hips will not happen again.

525
00:29:26,770 --> 00:29:29,970
You don't think so? No. It wouldn't
happen again. Hunting and fishing,

526
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,610
what happened again? For sure.
Yeah. Do you know what I'm saying?

527
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:35,820
But certain aspects of culture
you'd think? Yeah, like
writing books. I don't know.

528
00:29:36,270 --> 00:29:40,920
Maybe it was like, uh, maybe it wouldn't
happen again. You know, singing songs.

529
00:29:40,921 --> 00:29:42,070
I bet you seeking something

530
00:29:42,110 --> 00:29:45,310
would have happened again. Singing songs
wouldn't know it would have happened to.

531
00:29:45,320 --> 00:29:49,440
Definitely. Definitely. As
with jokes, jokes would be
written. They would, it would,

532
00:29:49,510 --> 00:29:51,580
it would happen. All happen
everywhere. In every culture.

533
00:29:51,590 --> 00:29:53,920
I think people are going to record
keeping, but yeah, you're right.

534
00:29:53,921 --> 00:29:56,380
Like look at the different branches
that civilization has taken.

535
00:29:56,381 --> 00:29:58,900
If you just pay attention to the world,
like you know you've got to,

536
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:01,270
I just got back from Brazil, you
know, you're different cultures.

537
00:30:01,300 --> 00:30:04,110
That's a totally different branch of how,

538
00:30:04,390 --> 00:30:08,710
how you can live or go on and went off
on their own trip and then their own trip

539
00:30:08,711 --> 00:30:11,950
happens to be in South America.
Our own trip is up here in North America.

540
00:30:11,951 --> 00:30:12,770
I mean it's like you know,

541
00:30:12,770 --> 00:30:16,330
you have to change it based
on your environment and how
much you have to protect

542
00:30:16,331 --> 00:30:17,680
yourself from the environment as well.

543
00:30:17,680 --> 00:30:21,490
You know that's a lot of how their
behavior is based but it's a,

544
00:30:21,491 --> 00:30:24,490
it's amazing how many variables there
are when you think about it. Yeah.

545
00:30:25,410 --> 00:30:27,670
Now that you bring up South America,
I will tell you another trippy thing.

546
00:30:28,190 --> 00:30:30,100
I don't,
I don't want to like drag design with the,

547
00:30:30,190 --> 00:30:33,550
with like human migrations up
am I was in or interesting.

548
00:30:33,940 --> 00:30:37,150
I'm interested like through the lens like
cause I like the hunt through the lens

549
00:30:37,151 --> 00:30:37,481
of honey.

550
00:30:37,481 --> 00:30:40,720
I'm interested in early hunters because
these guys hunted all the time and for

551
00:30:40,721 --> 00:30:45,490
their life. That's, listen, this is a,
there's a life and death struggle to that,

552
00:30:45,670 --> 00:30:46,151
that you know,

553
00:30:46,151 --> 00:30:49,510
we in this first world where you just
go to the supermarket and get your food,

554
00:30:49,511 --> 00:30:51,520
whether you're immediately
or not, I mean the, the,

555
00:30:51,700 --> 00:30:55,960
the lack of understanding and appreciation
of hunting and gathering and that

556
00:30:55,961 --> 00:31:00,100
it's literally a part of being a
human being. Maybe not hunting.

557
00:31:00,101 --> 00:31:01,840
If you really become a
vegetarian and you're,

558
00:31:02,040 --> 00:31:03,880
you're just gung Ho for
that for whatever reason,

559
00:31:03,881 --> 00:31:06,940
you're allowed your own thoughts.
I don't mind, I don't care.

560
00:31:06,941 --> 00:31:08,410
I don't want to change
anybody's opinion on it,

561
00:31:08,710 --> 00:31:10,630
but you're just making
your own vegetable garden,

562
00:31:10,631 --> 00:31:14,480
growing your own food and eating it and
for surviving off some stuff that you

563
00:31:14,510 --> 00:31:15,850
have actually grown yourself.

564
00:31:15,900 --> 00:31:18,820
You have this like really intimate
relationship with your food then,

565
00:31:19,180 --> 00:31:23,950
which I think is a part of being an
intelligent thing that is aware of its

566
00:31:23,951 --> 00:31:24,730
environment.

567
00:31:24,730 --> 00:31:28,840
I think one of the issues that human
beings have as a whole is that in order to

568
00:31:28,841 --> 00:31:29,740
feed us all,

569
00:31:29,741 --> 00:31:33,910
in order to move us all in the general
direction that we move in and to do it in

570
00:31:33,911 --> 00:31:36,970
big cities that live on the waters,
you're going to have a lot of waste.

571
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:39,490
You don't have pollution, you're
going to have pro. It's just going to,

572
00:31:39,640 --> 00:31:44,110
it's not going to be done clean and tidy.
It's going to be done wild and chaotic,

573
00:31:44,370 --> 00:31:44,741
you know,

574
00:31:44,741 --> 00:31:49,270
and a lot of it is because we are not
feeling the damage that we're doing.

575
00:31:49,390 --> 00:31:53,380
It's not like we are, you know, shitting
in our own backyard and going, man,

576
00:31:53,381 --> 00:31:56,080
maybe you should stop shitting in the
backyard. This is ruining the whole place.

577
00:31:56,290 --> 00:31:59,110
No, it's happening somewhere that's
not even anywhere near your house.

578
00:31:59,260 --> 00:32:02,200
And as long as you can
get your cheeseburger, you
don't give a fuck. You know,

579
00:32:02,201 --> 00:32:05,230
as long as you can pull into that drive
through and then an ass friend number

580
00:32:05,231 --> 00:32:09,340
two large and just, you know, give him
some paper and then you've got your food.

581
00:32:09,341 --> 00:32:13,800
It's that easy. That lack of connection
when you're still a carnival,

582
00:32:13,810 --> 00:32:14,860
when you still an animal,

583
00:32:15,010 --> 00:32:19,960
you'll still a biological entity that's
processing other biological entities and

584
00:32:19,961 --> 00:32:22,580
plants and you know, I mean
you're, you're, you have to,

585
00:32:22,630 --> 00:32:24,760
you're living off living things period.

586
00:32:24,910 --> 00:32:29,290
Everybody is with your fucking vegetarian
and not man, but we don't feel that.

587
00:32:29,410 --> 00:32:30,730
We don't feel that because,

588
00:32:30,731 --> 00:32:34,300
because we have completely distanced
ourselves from the gathering and the

589
00:32:34,301 --> 00:32:35,170
growing and all that.

590
00:32:35,320 --> 00:32:38,890
We're like little children so we just
shit all over the floor and that's,

591
00:32:38,940 --> 00:32:40,250
that's literally

592
00:32:40,450 --> 00:32:41,600
and not men.
My opinion,

593
00:32:41,750 --> 00:32:45,170
one of the number one things
that's wrong with human culture,

594
00:32:45,290 --> 00:32:50,120
we've grown too fast for our biology
I think. I think that's a valid point.

595
00:32:50,150 --> 00:32:53,390
And I would say, I hate to
hammer it home and say like, Oh,

596
00:32:53,391 --> 00:32:56,780
you're not a complete person if you
don't have the experience of putting your

597
00:32:56,781 --> 00:32:59,960
own food or growing your own food.
I don't want to be extreme like that,

598
00:32:59,961 --> 00:33:03,830
but I'll say it like there's this whole
suite of human activities that seem to

599
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:08,850
help you develop and do a fuller
person as does like pairing,

600
00:33:08,910 --> 00:33:12,560
eating like reading is helpful
for your world perspective.

601
00:33:12,740 --> 00:33:15,980
I think that some amount of travel is
helpful for your world perspective.

602
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:18,380
I think that doing some,

603
00:33:18,440 --> 00:33:22,070
some hunting or or some sort of food
gathering is helpful for your world

604
00:33:22,071 --> 00:33:25,310
perspective. Not even say we were
talking about earlier New York earlier,

605
00:33:25,311 --> 00:33:28,940
I started a garden. We have a lot, we
have a 800 square foot garden in New York,

606
00:33:28,941 --> 00:33:32,510
which is a rarity and then
I beat this garden into the,

607
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:37,580
into the weeds and detritus that was in
that backyard and I later had the soil

608
00:33:37,581 --> 00:33:42,581
tested and had very high elevated
levels of lead and I've been trying to

609
00:33:44,180 --> 00:33:46,430
mitigate that over the years
and get it under control

610
00:33:48,350 --> 00:33:51,200
from pollution from let
it get what they want.

611
00:33:51,201 --> 00:33:56,201
When I set my stuff off to Cornell to
have it tested and the paperwork they gave

612
00:33:56,211 --> 00:33:59,690
me said that people have a
tendency to blame led paint,

613
00:33:59,691 --> 00:34:04,040
but of it was from just leaded gasoline
that there was that much exhaust over

614
00:34:04,041 --> 00:34:07,640
those years of lead gasoline that just
led to settle and assist near the surface.

615
00:34:07,670 --> 00:34:10,700
I remember when people were mad that
they got rid of letting remember it.

616
00:34:10,701 --> 00:34:14,900
I remember like I remember
like I graduated high school
in 1992 I remember dudes

617
00:34:14,901 --> 00:34:18,820
have an old time old cars and they would
have to buy led additive and added into

618
00:34:18,830 --> 00:34:22,060
old cars. They couldn't get knighted
gas anymore, you know? Yeah. I remember.

619
00:34:22,070 --> 00:34:25,990
It seems like so long ago now. It's crazy,
but I'm thinking about it, but yeah,

620
00:34:26,300 --> 00:34:29,240
that awareness all of a sudden about loud,
are you replacing this?

621
00:34:29,241 --> 00:34:31,490
So know there's a number
things they tell you to do. A

622
00:34:33,050 --> 00:34:37,490
lower on the Ph scales lower,
high,

623
00:34:37,790 --> 00:34:41,780
low as acidic, right? I
don't know. Seven is neutral.

624
00:34:41,810 --> 00:34:45,560
Six is slightly acidic.
They tell you to raise the Ph.

625
00:34:46,100 --> 00:34:51,100
They tell you to introduce a lot of
organic matter and that will inhibit the

626
00:34:51,621 --> 00:34:55,700
plant's ability to pickup led and
they tell you to not plant, um,

627
00:34:55,730 --> 00:34:59,780
things like potatoes and things
where there might be actual physical

628
00:34:59,781 --> 00:35:03,860
contamination of dirt that the
fear is it you're just eating dirt.

629
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:07,400
It's not that the plants uptake,
I mean the plant can't uptake led at some,

630
00:35:07,940 --> 00:35:09,410
at some amount under some conditions,

631
00:35:09,590 --> 00:35:12,290
but mainly they don't want you
eating the dirt. So it's spinach,

632
00:35:12,291 --> 00:35:14,900
which has a lot of folds.
We're talking about insect contamination,

633
00:35:14,901 --> 00:35:18,470
knew there the same plants that would
have a tendency to like hold insect eggs

634
00:35:18,471 --> 00:35:21,770
and you don't wash them out properly.
They tried to get you to not grow that.

635
00:35:21,950 --> 00:35:25,750
So the ideal plant for leaded
soil would be like leather.

636
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:29,540
You grew a tomato for instance. It's way
off the ground. It's very easy to clean.

637
00:35:30,110 --> 00:35:33,710
But dealing with that little battle,
you know,

638
00:35:33,711 --> 00:35:36,230
just for the simple desire like grow food,
you know,

639
00:35:36,620 --> 00:35:39,960
made me more aware of,
uh,

640
00:35:40,420 --> 00:35:44,880
of the complications of having
some level of an urban life.

641
00:35:45,300 --> 00:35:47,460
You know, it's like there's,
it's in your mind like, oh,

642
00:35:47,461 --> 00:35:49,170
of course the city must be polluted.
It's a city.

643
00:35:49,320 --> 00:35:53,280
But then to go out and see it in your
yard and like battle it and have it put to

644
00:35:53,281 --> 00:35:54,690
you in numbers,
you know,

645
00:35:54,691 --> 00:35:59,691
like you have blank parts per million
lead really woke me up to that level and

646
00:36:00,541 --> 00:36:05,541
also kind of infuriated me
in an environmental way to
think that it seems like

647
00:36:05,821 --> 00:36:08,130
some kind of like God given,
right,

648
00:36:08,730 --> 00:36:11,790
that if you've got dirt you should be
able to grow plants on it and imagine that

649
00:36:11,820 --> 00:36:16,810
we're at a point where you're
growing plants out of the dirt for,

650
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:21,130
you know, the, this like you're
advised against eating to me, you know,

651
00:36:21,210 --> 00:36:25,440
it was just kind of like upsetting.
It's upsetting to me. And again,

652
00:36:25,441 --> 00:36:30,180
it's like process that like weird lack
of imagination where until something's

653
00:36:30,181 --> 00:36:33,870
really brought home to me really clearly.
It doesn't make as much sense to me.

654
00:36:34,140 --> 00:36:39,090
I used to be not like, I used to
tend to be not very sensitive, um,

655
00:36:39,180 --> 00:36:41,370
about deforestation or about development.

656
00:36:41,710 --> 00:36:46,680
And it was only until now when I go and
visit where I grew up in all the woods I

657
00:36:46,681 --> 00:36:48,330
that I hung out in,
you know,

658
00:36:48,390 --> 00:36:51,600
and I could leave my home and wander
for miles and some directions.

659
00:36:51,930 --> 00:36:54,000
It just had to cross a road on them,
but always be in the woods.

660
00:36:54,120 --> 00:36:56,720
It's all built up. It's
all built up now. Wow.

661
00:36:56,910 --> 00:36:59,910
And so now I could have heard about it
happening to a hundred other guys and it

662
00:36:59,911 --> 00:37:03,660
wouldn't have bothered me, but to go to
my spots where I hung out and be like,

663
00:37:03,661 --> 00:37:07,440
yeah, I couldn't go where I used to hang
out without crossing 20 people's yards.

664
00:37:07,441 --> 00:37:11,100
And getting hollered at all of a
sudden makes me be like, you know what?

665
00:37:13,020 --> 00:37:14,720
We need to really check out

666
00:37:14,760 --> 00:37:19,140
what we have for wildlife habitat and
what we have for like places to hang out

667
00:37:19,230 --> 00:37:22,500
in what we have that
hasn't been destroyed yet.

668
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:26,410
And be maybe a little more conservative
with it and a little more like

669
00:37:26,610 --> 00:37:27,443
parsimonious.

670
00:37:27,630 --> 00:37:31,440
And it's always those little awakenings
that I get only on a personal level, man.

671
00:37:31,490 --> 00:37:32,340
You know?
Well,

672
00:37:32,341 --> 00:37:36,240
I think we all experience information
that way because if we didn't,

673
00:37:36,270 --> 00:37:39,240
there's so much that we're
getting every day on CNN. I mean,

674
00:37:39,241 --> 00:37:41,370
imagine if he took every
God damn story to heart.

675
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:44,640
Like who was your own house
that was getting foreclosed on,

676
00:37:44,641 --> 00:37:47,980
or your own kid that was kidnapped or
your own friend that was shot or you know,

677
00:37:48,020 --> 00:37:51,720
you know your own house, but there's
too much. It's too much information.

678
00:37:51,840 --> 00:37:54,480
So you see, oh, 10 people died
in Iraq today. You're like, wow,

679
00:37:54,481 --> 00:37:57,780
I guess that really sucks man. You
know, I feel bad for the family.

680
00:37:57,900 --> 00:38:00,240
You're not even really personifying.

681
00:38:00,550 --> 00:38:04,300
You almost said it down to
remind yourself at some news.

682
00:38:04,750 --> 00:38:08,050
You got to sit down and like take a
moment and remind yourself to feel the

683
00:38:08,051 --> 00:38:10,630
emotion of it. Yeah. I find myself
doing that all the time. Like, wow,

684
00:38:10,631 --> 00:38:12,070
you should really feel this should be,

685
00:38:12,071 --> 00:38:14,830
they should have like a sense of
gravity to you. And, and I'd be like,

686
00:38:14,860 --> 00:38:19,450
now I will take a moment and allow
myself to feel what I should feel.

687
00:38:19,451 --> 00:38:21,220
But you know,
but maybe I'm too busy to feel.

688
00:38:21,270 --> 00:38:26,020
Yeah. I, I've, I've heard like when people
talk about the miles of the rain forest,

689
00:38:26,021 --> 00:38:28,940
that gets chewed up every year
and those numbers are the,

690
00:38:28,970 --> 00:38:32,820
it's a staggering number. It's a
terrifying number. Just miles and miles.

691
00:38:32,821 --> 00:38:35,620
A rain forest that gets
eaten up and it really,

692
00:38:36,100 --> 00:38:40,510
I can't, doesn't register. I
can't, I can't register it.
I know it's bad. It's bad.

693
00:38:40,511 --> 00:38:42,790
It's terrible. But am I
feeling it? I'm not feeling it.

694
00:38:42,820 --> 00:38:45,910
I don't know why I'm not feeling it.
I'm, I'm a concerned person. If you ha,

695
00:38:45,940 --> 00:38:47,470
if you said, hey, you can make the call,

696
00:38:47,471 --> 00:38:50,800
should they be allowed to chop down those
trees? I'd say no. Stop right there.

697
00:38:50,950 --> 00:38:52,120
The rain forest is amazing,

698
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:54,350
but

699
00:38:54,350 --> 00:38:58,100
still it doesn't matter you, you
unless you see it, unless you're there,

700
00:38:58,101 --> 00:39:01,280
unless it's like a part of
your life, you know. I don't,

701
00:39:01,281 --> 00:39:04,050
I don't think you're going to, it's, we
flew over the rain forest because we,

702
00:39:04,051 --> 00:39:07,760
we went to Brazil this past weekend and
it was day time while we're flying and I

703
00:39:07,761 --> 00:39:11,810
was looking down and I'm like,
wow, that is fucking nuts.

704
00:39:11,940 --> 00:39:16,080
Yeah, it's, it's I, the first time
I flew over like the Amazon area,

705
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:19,920
you grew up with one
impression of wilderness.

706
00:39:19,950 --> 00:39:22,440
Like if you grow up with an American
impression of wilderness and we have,

707
00:39:23,010 --> 00:39:25,290
we're very fortunate in our resources.

708
00:39:25,291 --> 00:39:29,690
I mean if you look at how much money we
make and how many people live here and

709
00:39:29,691 --> 00:39:34,540
when we've done a pretty phenomenal job
preserving some places to fly over like

710
00:39:35,100 --> 00:39:39,770
the northern half of South
America. Yeah. Is so fucking crazy.

711
00:39:39,830 --> 00:39:42,920
I mean like, like I always
look at everything like this,

712
00:39:42,930 --> 00:39:47,280
kind of like hunter angle and I looked
down there and I'd like to know that

713
00:39:47,281 --> 00:39:50,280
there are people down there
who've had very limited,

714
00:39:50,910 --> 00:39:54,990
perhaps no experience with the outside
world because then that's used to seem to

715
00:39:54,991 --> 00:39:56,130
me like that can't be true.

716
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:59,540
Did you fly down there and you realize
that you've just flown four hours and

717
00:39:59,580 --> 00:40:03,660
there's been nothing, no road,
no anything. You're like,
oh, now it makes sense. Yeah.

718
00:40:03,690 --> 00:40:07,770
For guys live around the rain forest
while you're going 500 miles an hour,

719
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:10,350
you're like, a guy could live
down there and you would never,

720
00:40:10,380 --> 00:40:11,213
you would never know.

721
00:40:11,320 --> 00:40:12,700
Yeah. It's amazing. You know,

722
00:40:12,730 --> 00:40:16,000
they said that the most recent
uncontacted tribe there,

723
00:40:16,010 --> 00:40:19,430
these photos of them and video,
it's actually a hoax like somebody had,

724
00:40:19,700 --> 00:40:21,280
they had fucking fake.

725
00:40:21,820 --> 00:40:25,570
Yeah. You know, I know I heard what
you're talking about, the starving,

726
00:40:25,720 --> 00:40:29,280
but it was for a while they thought they
advantaged, like people that were red.

727
00:40:29,360 --> 00:40:30,150
They were,
they weren't.

728
00:40:30,150 --> 00:40:34,300
Yeah. Red. Yeah. There's still
on I and not uncontacted tribes,

729
00:40:34,301 --> 00:40:38,140
but tribes that have had very, very
limited contact with the outside world,

730
00:40:38,380 --> 00:40:40,330
and it's just because
the actual volume of it,

731
00:40:40,331 --> 00:40:44,980
but it's an amazing that
there's environments where
people live that they really

732
00:40:44,981 --> 00:40:48,340
just got to a certain point, they said,
listen, fuck electronics and everything.

733
00:40:48,341 --> 00:40:50,350
Like it rains every day.
That shit's not gonna work.

734
00:40:50,500 --> 00:40:51,760
We're never going to develop any of that.

735
00:40:51,790 --> 00:40:53,620
We just need to be really
good with bows and arrows,

736
00:40:53,890 --> 00:40:56,320
and there's plenty of food
here. It's just stop. I mean,

737
00:40:56,500 --> 00:40:59,500
and there's a lot of people that admire
that and they look at that like, wow,

738
00:40:59,530 --> 00:41:02,020
there's something magical about
the way these people live.

739
00:41:02,021 --> 00:41:05,820
Like I have friends that have gone to
a different parts of South America for

740
00:41:05,870 --> 00:41:07,560
IOWASCA rituals.
You know,

741
00:41:08,110 --> 00:41:13,030
you're talking about tools and you'll
stay in these, uh, these camps, these,

742
00:41:13,031 --> 00:41:14,350
you know, these, these towns,

743
00:41:14,351 --> 00:41:18,040
these villages I guess with these people
and these straw houses and you'll stay

744
00:41:18,041 --> 00:41:21,420
with them for like a week.
And one of my buddies went and was like,

745
00:41:21,480 --> 00:41:25,000
the crazy thing is like at first you see,
you kind of feel bad for them,

746
00:41:25,390 --> 00:41:29,170
but then when you're leaving you kind of
feel bad for yourself. He's like, fuck,

747
00:41:29,171 --> 00:41:32,440
I got to deal with bills and all this
bullshit that the weather is always

748
00:41:32,441 --> 00:41:34,860
perfect here. When it rains
they get inside. Yeah.

749
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:38,540
I mean it's like they're like living in
paradise and they're pulling fish out of

750
00:41:38,541 --> 00:41:42,020
the river on a regular basis. Shooting
animals. The animals are everywhere.

751
00:41:42,021 --> 00:41:45,570
Stick together, look out for Jaguars
were good. And you're like, man, who,

752
00:41:45,870 --> 00:41:48,560
if it is a temporary experience
and it absolutely is. I mean,

753
00:41:48,561 --> 00:41:51,590
no one gets out of this alive who sues,
doing it the right way.

754
00:41:51,770 --> 00:41:52,910
They look like they're having fun.

755
00:41:53,570 --> 00:41:56,780
Yeah. I think too that it
doesn't need to be like for, for,

756
00:41:56,781 --> 00:42:01,781
for ancestral hunter gatherers or
people who are hanging out on land that

757
00:42:02,661 --> 00:42:06,280
they've probably been on for
10 generations, you know,

758
00:42:06,290 --> 00:42:11,150
20 to infinity generations. Right. It
doesn't need to be an all or nothing.

759
00:42:11,151 --> 00:42:16,060
Like I had the experience last
winter. Um, so hunt with some guys in,

760
00:42:16,061 --> 00:42:21,061
in Guyana dam and they have
some access to internet.

761
00:42:23,710 --> 00:42:26,870
You know, they have like DVDs
laying around their place.

762
00:42:26,871 --> 00:42:29,810
They have a generator that gives them
electricity some amount of time during the

763
00:42:29,810 --> 00:42:32,960
day. Um, they had never heard of pizza.

764
00:42:33,260 --> 00:42:38,090
One of them had a t shirt with Muhammad
Ali on it. I asked them who that was.

765
00:42:38,250 --> 00:42:40,730
He, he didn't know who
that was. So there's some,

766
00:42:40,731 --> 00:42:42,830
like they've had the t shirt
but they don't know who's on it.

767
00:42:42,950 --> 00:42:44,780
Do you know what I'm saying?
Right there. Kinda like half,

768
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:49,190
like a foot into the modern world
and a foot out. But just due to the,

769
00:42:49,520 --> 00:42:52,610
to where they live.
And due to financial constraints,

770
00:42:52,640 --> 00:42:53,900
they provide all their own food.

771
00:42:54,050 --> 00:42:58,010
So they raised their own food and these
guys hunt 200 250 days a year if they

772
00:42:58,011 --> 00:43:00,200
don't have on it. Cause they
got something today before they,

773
00:43:00,201 --> 00:43:02,810
they're a hundred fish every
day so well because they're not,

774
00:43:02,811 --> 00:43:04,700
they don't have enough
refrigerators to keep things.

775
00:43:05,070 --> 00:43:08,000
They don't bring it and it'd be too far
to bring it to be too expensive to bring

776
00:43:08,001 --> 00:43:10,100
it and they have like
ready access to stuff.

777
00:43:10,340 --> 00:43:14,930
So it would be that you to think that
right now it's almost kind of an inspiring

778
00:43:14,931 --> 00:43:17,720
thought to think that
right now there are people,

779
00:43:17,721 --> 00:43:22,130
I'll name one guy was guy
named Rovan who wakes up,

780
00:43:22,190 --> 00:43:27,190
he's able to wake up and check his email
and he's obligated that day to go hunt

781
00:43:29,571 --> 00:43:32,480
something for his family to
eat for dinner. It's like the,

782
00:43:32,481 --> 00:43:36,170
that these two things can
still exist side by side. Wow.

783
00:43:36,290 --> 00:43:39,650
It's Kinda my binding because he can get
a computer but he just can't get food,

784
00:43:40,010 --> 00:43:43,340
you know. And this guy has a remote garden
area and his whole family will take,

785
00:43:43,341 --> 00:43:47,840
dug out canoes to the garden area and
check on the garden and harvest what they

786
00:43:47,841 --> 00:43:49,100
have and tend to everything.

787
00:43:49,310 --> 00:43:53,090
Then they go back to their hunting camp
and like turn on various things they've

788
00:43:53,091 --> 00:43:56,390
gotten through government grants
and things and like in log on and,

789
00:43:56,990 --> 00:44:00,140
and see if you want to be his friend
on Facebook. I'm not joking. It is.

790
00:44:00,141 --> 00:44:04,250
So it's so bizarre, you know, and just
kind of tell that guy, that guy's a dress.

791
00:44:04,251 --> 00:44:07,040
I want to be his friend on Facebook.
Oh, doodle have you over there.

792
00:44:07,041 --> 00:44:08,150
And they got like a,
you know,

793
00:44:08,151 --> 00:44:11,510
he's got like a couple Puranas hanging
up and he's making dinner. Wow.

794
00:44:11,540 --> 00:44:16,110
So now what did you guys hunt for
when you went there? We hunted, um,

795
00:44:16,310 --> 00:44:20,720
a number of large fish that
the, hang on here, the servers,

796
00:44:20,721 --> 00:44:23,780
they have one. And when I say hunted,
they fished primary with bows and arrows.

797
00:44:24,080 --> 00:44:29,030
So they're shooting fish. The one called
a [inaudible] one called Airwatch.

798
00:44:29,130 --> 00:44:30,690
This was on your show?
Yeah. Yeah, we do. Yeah,

799
00:44:30,691 --> 00:44:35,210
we do have down here the dude was like
really good at judging the reflect

800
00:44:35,220 --> 00:44:39,240
refraction. Is that what it is to fix your
feet when you're looking at the water?

801
00:44:39,241 --> 00:44:41,250
It's hard to see where the fish really is.
There's like a little,

802
00:44:41,251 --> 00:44:44,040
he's not where you have to aim way low.
So if you're,

803
00:44:44,300 --> 00:44:48,180
imagine that you're standing on the bank
of a lake looking into lake and there

804
00:44:48,181 --> 00:44:52,080
was a fish who's maybe 24
inches below the surface,

805
00:44:52,650 --> 00:44:53,483
mmm.

806
00:44:53,770 --> 00:44:55,240
You would be aiming?

807
00:44:56,150 --> 00:44:56,880
Yeah,

808
00:44:56,880 --> 00:45:00,910
you'd be aiming a couple, let's say
he's like, he's 10 feet from the bank,

809
00:45:01,510 --> 00:45:03,130
24 inches below the surface.

810
00:45:03,460 --> 00:45:06,850
You'd be aiming at what would appear
to be about three feet below that fish.

811
00:45:06,880 --> 00:45:11,140
So if you're looking at them from a
standing position and there are any thing

812
00:45:11,200 --> 00:45:13,930
other than directly underneath you,
there's an optical illusion.

813
00:45:13,931 --> 00:45:16,470
Is that what it is? Yeah, you got to
aim low. But where they're hunting,

814
00:45:16,471 --> 00:45:18,220
they're hung in the river.
So when I was growing up,

815
00:45:18,221 --> 00:45:23,221
we would shoot a lot of carp
with bows in still water,

816
00:45:24,380 --> 00:45:29,080
um, in, in very fast modern bowls
with really heavy fiberglass arrows.

817
00:45:29,110 --> 00:45:32,620
Which don't they keep their velocity
when it hit the water pretty good.

818
00:45:32,621 --> 00:45:35,940
They're fast. These guys are shooting
an arrow. It's actually boiling it,

819
00:45:36,270 --> 00:45:37,210
their Arrow floats.

820
00:45:37,450 --> 00:45:42,250
So the Arrow really slows down when it
hits the water and they're shooting fish

821
00:45:42,251 --> 00:45:43,084
in moving water.

822
00:45:43,780 --> 00:45:48,610
So not only are you judging refraction
light refraction your where you know you

823
00:45:48,611 --> 00:45:51,520
have to aim low,
you also have to aim way upstream.

824
00:45:52,450 --> 00:45:57,450
And the arrows are affected in a very
profound way by all aspects of the water.

825
00:45:57,761 --> 00:46:00,790
Like the Arrow comes to a stop.
It drifts into current.

826
00:46:00,791 --> 00:46:03,580
Very good cause it's buoyant.
So if you're like,

827
00:46:03,581 --> 00:46:05,710
you might find yourself aiming at a,

828
00:46:06,360 --> 00:46:10,390
there's this herbivorous Parana there.
It's like a favorite fish.

829
00:46:10,870 --> 00:46:15,390
That's the pocket. Yeah.
You might be holding try.

830
00:46:15,640 --> 00:46:17,140
The fish is moving for one thing.

831
00:46:17,170 --> 00:46:22,170
So the fish is on the move and you're
holding maybe what looks to be three feet

832
00:46:22,301 --> 00:46:25,510
below it and two feet out ahead of it.

833
00:46:25,810 --> 00:46:29,440
So that's where you're aiming as it's
moving because you need to figure that

834
00:46:29,441 --> 00:46:33,760
that Arrow is going to drift down current.
Wow. Before it makes contact with fish.

835
00:46:33,761 --> 00:46:36,460
That's like playing online video
games with a shitty connection.

836
00:46:36,590 --> 00:46:39,860
If you've got 50,
exactly six k connection number.

837
00:46:39,870 --> 00:46:44,230
That I wonder what happened when you play,
when you play certain games,

838
00:46:44,231 --> 00:46:47,470
you'd have to leave the guy, you remember
that Brian, when you had lag, you know,

839
00:46:47,860 --> 00:46:49,480
so you'd, you'd have probably
been really good at this.

840
00:46:49,490 --> 00:46:53,380
Haven't had those experiences. But I shot
at though I shot it, that kind of fish.

841
00:46:53,880 --> 00:46:54,713
MMM.

842
00:46:55,950 --> 00:47:00,720
Around 25 times four. I hit one. Wow.
Over the course of several days. Wow.

843
00:47:00,721 --> 00:47:03,180
So it was more than one day
before you hit one. Oh yeah, man.

844
00:47:03,300 --> 00:47:07,050
So like I think I finally killed one
on my third day and we would only go at

845
00:47:07,110 --> 00:47:10,130
optimum light when you have a good
high sun, like saying like, like,

846
00:47:10,170 --> 00:47:13,740
like I like to fish with a fly rod for
bone fish and stuff and just is basically

847
00:47:13,741 --> 00:47:18,630
good, you know, from 10 to
two, like the lights right
to, to, to see into the water.

848
00:47:19,080 --> 00:47:22,030
Another thing we did was we hunted birds,
um,

849
00:47:22,140 --> 00:47:26,460
with bows and I brought
down a, uh, a compound bow,

850
00:47:26,461 --> 00:47:30,010
like a modern boat.
And they in those guys call it,

851
00:47:30,011 --> 00:47:31,030
some of those guys speak English.

852
00:47:31,031 --> 00:47:35,630
They've been trained to speak English in
order to navigate in a modern world and

853
00:47:35,650 --> 00:47:38,860
with tourism and political issues because
their national language is English,

854
00:47:38,861 --> 00:47:42,010
even though they're Macusa and
they speak a tribal language.

855
00:47:42,010 --> 00:47:45,790
Indigenously but so you could speak some
English with them and they would call

856
00:47:45,791 --> 00:47:48,760
my bowl the fancy bow, you know? And um,

857
00:47:49,090 --> 00:47:51,370
they were blown away by the
bow and I felt kind of like,

858
00:47:52,420 --> 00:47:54,640
at times I thought about leaving my
bowl there, but I thought I'd be like,

859
00:47:54,641 --> 00:47:56,110
remember that God's must be crazy.

860
00:47:56,470 --> 00:47:59,560
Like that coke bottle flies out of that
thing and like totally changes those

861
00:47:59,561 --> 00:48:02,760
people's lives. I was like, if I
left these dudes with this bow,

862
00:48:03,580 --> 00:48:07,060
the jungle be gone, man. It'd
be emptied of animals, you know,

863
00:48:07,061 --> 00:48:10,660
they would like get everything there so
they'd have to make get arrows though.

864
00:48:10,720 --> 00:48:14,060
How many hours did you have? That's true.
They would venture run out of arrows.

865
00:48:14,770 --> 00:48:18,490
Arrows are you gonna make aluminum
arrows. And I would a jungle. These guys,

866
00:48:18,491 --> 00:48:21,090
what was funny too is um,
you know,

867
00:48:21,100 --> 00:48:22,990
have all these crazy plants that
they make their bowls narrows.

868
00:48:23,110 --> 00:48:26,500
The only thing they need to make their
bow and Arrow is they use a piece of hog

869
00:48:26,501 --> 00:48:30,820
fence, like a piece of wire fence and
they use that to make part of the head.

870
00:48:31,330 --> 00:48:33,730
But I was saying like, what's that
plant you make the arrows out of?

871
00:48:34,420 --> 00:48:37,000
He thinks about, he's
like aero plan, you know,

872
00:48:37,001 --> 00:48:41,200
and then they got a plant today they
called the Arrow plants and it's supposed

873
00:48:41,201 --> 00:48:44,110
to be straight like straight,
straight, straight, like a laser man.

874
00:48:44,200 --> 00:48:49,060
And then they make,
they pull these leaves to make string.

875
00:48:49,360 --> 00:48:51,050
They go out and harvest uh,

876
00:48:51,130 --> 00:48:55,480
Robert from a rubber
tree to coat to string,

877
00:48:55,481 --> 00:48:58,330
like to wax a string. Wow.
Then they get feathers.

878
00:48:58,331 --> 00:49:01,210
Like we went out and killed a bird.
I with my compound bow,

879
00:49:01,211 --> 00:49:04,950
I shot a bird down out of a tree
that they eat the Chrysalis curse.

880
00:49:04,951 --> 00:49:08,710
So there's like how many, um, if you say
there was a hundred species of birds,

881
00:49:08,711 --> 00:49:11,980
what, what percentage of them
do you think they eat? The main,

882
00:49:12,010 --> 00:49:15,070
well are there certain brands you
just can't eat? They're just no good.

883
00:49:15,100 --> 00:49:17,860
Most birds they would just,
it wasn't a day disregard them.

884
00:49:17,890 --> 00:49:19,990
They would like observe
them and discuss them.

885
00:49:20,080 --> 00:49:25,080
But it wasn't on their radar as a
food bird as a flavor or is it a,

886
00:49:25,810 --> 00:49:29,980
I think it would probably wind up being,
if I had to guess bird flesh.

887
00:49:29,981 --> 00:49:33,280
You'll find that like birds
tend to taste pretty similar.

888
00:49:33,360 --> 00:49:36,850
You know there's not like bad tasting
birds and you know it winds up being like

889
00:49:36,851 --> 00:49:40,870
a yield issue. So some of the
birds or after would be that

890
00:49:42,550 --> 00:49:45,890
there's a strong likelihood that you're
not going to get your Arrow or the Arrow

891
00:49:45,900 --> 00:49:50,590
will be damaged. So you're weighing
like what does my Arrow worth?

892
00:49:50,591 --> 00:49:53,340
And there's these birds they like,
like crustless Curacao,

893
00:49:53,350 --> 00:49:58,210
black Curacao would be something
equivalent to a Turkey. Okay.

894
00:49:58,750 --> 00:50:01,870
This, they still one of those
and they would call them Po.

895
00:50:01,890 --> 00:50:03,070
There were poets or something.

896
00:50:03,071 --> 00:50:05,020
They would say when they see
him they see one of those.

897
00:50:05,021 --> 00:50:09,460
Everybody get excited because it was
just worthwhile. Like in a caloric sense,

898
00:50:09,461 --> 00:50:12,570
it was worth effort to try
to get the current style.

899
00:50:12,730 --> 00:50:15,040
And the other thing about the black
Chris, I was a black curse. I was what?

900
00:50:15,041 --> 00:50:18,070
They use a Fletcher arrows for the,
for the feathers on the arrows.

901
00:50:18,340 --> 00:50:20,200
So when I shot a curse out,

902
00:50:20,201 --> 00:50:23,830
we went out at three in the morning
pitch black to sneak up underneath where

903
00:50:23,831 --> 00:50:26,010
Curacao was hooting up in this tree and I,

904
00:50:26,050 --> 00:50:31,050
and I shot the down and he was really
happy that I shot that bird down one for

905
00:50:32,511 --> 00:50:34,130
eating.
But two because he would make,

906
00:50:34,460 --> 00:50:38,480
he told me he would make a year's worth
of arrows off the feathers off that

907
00:50:38,490 --> 00:50:39,710
Corsol.
Wow.

908
00:50:39,980 --> 00:50:43,610
So how do they attach the
feathers to the shafts they use?

909
00:50:44,090 --> 00:50:47,390
They'd take the on a feather, what
do you call like the, like the part,

910
00:50:47,391 --> 00:50:50,090
they'd be like equivalent to hair.
You have the vein and then you know,

911
00:50:50,091 --> 00:50:54,170
the other part they would clean a little
bit off each end and they would just

912
00:50:54,171 --> 00:50:56,660
tie it in two places.
Just wrap it in two places.

913
00:50:57,020 --> 00:51:01,070
So like imagine my finger being
that they would wrap it on one end,

914
00:51:01,220 --> 00:51:04,880
then he'd wrapped on the other end
and an aide caught a knock in there.

915
00:51:05,720 --> 00:51:08,660
And real simple. Yeah. And then
they would, then they would have,

916
00:51:08,690 --> 00:51:12,170
they would attach the arrowhead,

917
00:51:12,830 --> 00:51:15,230
they would make a steel arrowhead
out a piece of fence wire,

918
00:51:15,231 --> 00:51:19,190
but it would be socketed so it
would fit like a male female joint.

919
00:51:19,930 --> 00:51:23,480
How did they do that? Because
they would bend it. They would,

920
00:51:23,630 --> 00:51:28,330
they would peanut over with a
hammer on a rock fence wire. Yeah,

921
00:51:28,370 --> 00:51:29,960
they would beat it until it was flat,

922
00:51:29,961 --> 00:51:33,980
like aluminum foil thicker than aluminum
foil. And then they could curl it.

923
00:51:34,610 --> 00:51:37,440
So it'd be like a piece of fence where,
and you imagine is banging on a,

924
00:51:37,720 --> 00:51:42,720
imagine a pencil sized piece of wire and
you bang on that thing until you have a

925
00:51:42,951 --> 00:51:47,570
thing on the end of it. This is about
the size of a 50 cent piece of just flat,

926
00:51:47,571 --> 00:51:50,450
thin,
malleable metal steel.

927
00:51:51,740 --> 00:51:55,880
You can then shape that into
whatever shape you want.

928
00:51:55,910 --> 00:51:59,180
They would shape that into uh, like a, uh,

929
00:51:59,980 --> 00:52:04,910
a socket it end that would shape it into
like a cop and that cop would fit over

930
00:52:05,510 --> 00:52:09,290
the tip of the end of the stick.
That's the end of the Arrow.

931
00:52:09,380 --> 00:52:12,440
What did they do before there was fence
wire or four people came along where

932
00:52:12,441 --> 00:52:15,920
they could cut their wires, a stone and
bone, they would use stone and bone.

933
00:52:15,920 --> 00:52:19,820
And so there's a fairly
recent thing. Yeah, I mean
fairly read, I mean metal age,

934
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:24,490
but you know like even like precontact
you know, like many of the track here,

935
00:52:24,500 --> 00:52:25,230
you know,
in,

936
00:52:25,230 --> 00:52:29,210
in our portion of the hemisphere in
North America precontact there's people

937
00:52:29,211 --> 00:52:32,780
using copper know, like we're like
we're, I'm from native Americans.

938
00:52:32,790 --> 00:52:36,500
They were already had copper
technologies put together. So it's not,

939
00:52:37,520 --> 00:52:41,760
you could hardly argue that it's a modern
technology to take metal and hammering.

940
00:52:41,800 --> 00:52:43,580
I'm kind of malleable
metal and hammered out.

941
00:52:43,610 --> 00:52:48,320
However it is very modern technology to
cut it off a piece of fence, you know.

942
00:52:48,321 --> 00:52:51,680
So they would do that and that would
be the one that'd be the one main,

943
00:52:51,681 --> 00:52:52,430
main part.

944
00:52:52,430 --> 00:52:55,070
And here's the thing is this isn't
like those guys being cute like early,

945
00:52:55,071 --> 00:52:58,760
we're talking to like old hippies who
like to make addle. Addles this is guys,

946
00:52:59,240 --> 00:53:04,010
these are the pragmatic people,
you know, trying to stay alive,

947
00:53:04,310 --> 00:53:08,990
like making equipment. Um, but
beyond that they took to it,

948
00:53:09,370 --> 00:53:13,160
uh, certain flourish. Uh,

949
00:53:13,940 --> 00:53:17,840
each guy might have some little thing
he would do to make his special ed.

950
00:53:17,841 --> 00:53:22,580
He would wrap a black that he'd like do
black thread and then he wouldn't put

951
00:53:22,581 --> 00:53:26,640
the rubber on some of his thread and do
like a little bit of and then do some

952
00:53:26,641 --> 00:53:30,420
more black and he wrapping it up so that
it would be like as little signature

953
00:53:30,421 --> 00:53:35,400
style. Um, so it was a very pragmatic
device. They're hunting kit,

954
00:53:35,430 --> 00:53:39,960
but along with it would become some amount
of ornamentation or personalization.

955
00:53:40,260 --> 00:53:45,020
The same way. You know, you
buy a car and I put a van,

956
00:53:45,021 --> 00:53:47,970
he played out under change rooms. Like
you're like, this is mine. You know,

957
00:53:47,971 --> 00:53:49,980
like you look at this and you know,
it's mine.

958
00:53:50,280 --> 00:53:52,950
And they would have little
things like that they did,

959
00:53:53,010 --> 00:53:58,010
but that ornamentation wouldn't really
extend to like to their physicallness

960
00:53:59,760 --> 00:54:03,540
like they would largely where you know
when you picture that people bring

961
00:54:03,541 --> 00:54:08,220
clothes and donate old tee shirts and
someone puts them in a barrel and sends

962
00:54:08,221 --> 00:54:08,970
them off.

963
00:54:08,970 --> 00:54:13,260
I mean they would just be
dressed in American throwaways,

964
00:54:14,130 --> 00:54:19,130
like maybe sweat pants cut off and a tee
shirt that might say Lord knows what I

965
00:54:19,351 --> 00:54:23,220
mean. Anything on it. And they
would always, always barefoot.

966
00:54:23,310 --> 00:54:27,130
How long did you spend with these people?
Spent two weeks with him. Wow. Yeah.

967
00:54:27,210 --> 00:54:31,050
Just living like they live. Yeah, we ate
everything man. We ate just tons of stuff,

968
00:54:31,051 --> 00:54:33,870
you know, get sick at all. Never
know. You know what? I know.

969
00:54:34,020 --> 00:54:35,580
I don't know how cause I usually get sick.

970
00:54:35,670 --> 00:54:37,470
I just spent four days in
the hospital from being sick.

971
00:54:37,680 --> 00:54:42,330
Did four days in the hospital from
like a water for water? No waterborne,

972
00:54:42,750 --> 00:54:46,850
waterborne, waterborne ailments and
Ted Yardi or you cola or something.

973
00:54:47,220 --> 00:54:49,860
I had been this kind of
funny story because we had,

974
00:54:50,400 --> 00:54:55,400
we were filming a meat episode in Northern
California and I got into a killed a

975
00:54:55,741 --> 00:54:59,550
wild pig and wild pigs role and
poison oak. They like to roll in it.

976
00:55:00,780 --> 00:55:02,010
I had heard of this place for foreign,

977
00:55:02,011 --> 00:55:06,180
killed a pig and came home and had poison
oak. And so this time when I went out,

978
00:55:06,181 --> 00:55:08,740
I just really watched for poise, not
make sure I didn't get any poison, don't,

979
00:55:10,020 --> 00:55:13,010
but then kill this pig.
And the next day I'm,

980
00:55:13,770 --> 00:55:15,660
I have sleeves of infection,

981
00:55:16,140 --> 00:55:21,140
I'm arms and I had apparently did a
groin will scratch and that was all,

982
00:55:21,300 --> 00:55:23,780
you know, how does Steve,
oh, not get any of this.

983
00:55:23,781 --> 00:55:26,620
Remember we were talking to him about
drinking like jungle water. But yeah,

984
00:55:26,690 --> 00:55:28,610
he's a fucking drinks,
drinks,

985
00:55:28,611 --> 00:55:32,020
tap water everywhere he goes over
the world for his immune system. No,

986
00:55:32,060 --> 00:55:33,800
I believe it. Well, I
mean, think about it man.

987
00:55:33,801 --> 00:55:35,930
Like when you get a dog
and you get a new puppy,

988
00:55:35,931 --> 00:55:38,450
now he's going to get GRD a couple of
times and he never did. Gets it again.

989
00:55:38,780 --> 00:55:43,140
You build a tolerance to it, but so this
is a story starts to make its own gravy.

990
00:55:43,141 --> 00:55:44,160
I realize it's kind of a long story,

991
00:55:44,161 --> 00:55:48,930
but I got the poison oak so bad they
put me on prednisone. Wow. It's a wow.

992
00:55:49,290 --> 00:55:52,560
It's so pregnazone can
compromise your immune system.

993
00:55:54,480 --> 00:55:55,360
We then were we,

994
00:55:55,361 --> 00:55:59,370
we were in Arizona filming and we were
hunting Cuzdey are down there and ran out

995
00:55:59,371 --> 00:56:03,900
of water, a whitetail subspecies
called coups dear. Oh,

996
00:56:04,110 --> 00:56:08,490
so who's is slang for vagina? Is
it really? He didn't know that. No.

997
00:56:08,491 --> 00:56:12,850
I know some variations of that but not
that word. Coups. Brian boy, her son.

998
00:56:12,870 --> 00:56:14,640
I accrues once a month but I never,

999
00:56:14,641 --> 00:56:17,610
I never knew trolling was
trolling was for gay guys either.

1000
00:56:17,611 --> 00:56:21,970
Cause I tell people in Ohio I'm trolling
and they like all wink at me and starts

1001
00:56:22,020 --> 00:56:26,010
really trolling for gay guys.
For Northern Pike. Yeah.

1002
00:56:27,790 --> 00:56:29,280
Trolling online,
like you know,

1003
00:56:29,530 --> 00:56:32,320
trying to get people to pay attention
to a ridiculous story for his own

1004
00:56:32,321 --> 00:56:37,270
amusement. That's called online
trolling, trolling, trolling for fishing.

1005
00:56:37,420 --> 00:56:39,550
That is what a trawling as well.
But it's also, it's probably,

1006
00:56:39,551 --> 00:56:42,910
that's probably the dawn of it. Well, she
didn't steal it from online people. Yeah,

1007
00:56:42,980 --> 00:56:44,860
no, absolutely not. The online people,

1008
00:56:44,861 --> 00:56:47,200
I think they created a trolling because
it's sort of like they got a little

1009
00:56:47,201 --> 00:56:49,960
lower. Let's see who bites.
Let's see. Let's see.

1010
00:56:49,961 --> 00:56:52,570
He's with dummy argues with someone
who doesn't really believe what they're

1011
00:56:52,571 --> 00:56:54,520
saying, what they're only
saying things to be ridiculous.

1012
00:56:54,850 --> 00:56:56,920
I used to think it was cute,
but now I find it tiresome.

1013
00:56:56,950 --> 00:56:59,930
There's not enough time in the
world. So you get sick. Yeah, I'm,

1014
00:57:00,010 --> 00:57:01,900
the button is off and I had drank,

1015
00:57:02,320 --> 00:57:06,940
drank water out of this canyon and
sometimes the treat water with iodine

1016
00:57:06,941 --> 00:57:09,490
tablets, but the key with iodine
is you've got to let it sit.

1017
00:57:09,580 --> 00:57:12,600
So he did this for the show or you
did this because you were just,

1018
00:57:12,620 --> 00:57:15,370
when we were filming show
and ran out of water,

1019
00:57:15,371 --> 00:57:20,371
but we weren't like drinking creek water
as content because when we're doing

1020
00:57:21,911 --> 00:57:24,160
stuff we like really,
you know,

1021
00:57:24,190 --> 00:57:29,110
we really will walk along ways and run
out of stuff and eat some food out or eat

1022
00:57:29,111 --> 00:57:32,230
meat out or bought her out in the
process of making our shelves.

1023
00:57:32,231 --> 00:57:35,320
So we just got in a situation where we
had no water, went down into a canyon,

1024
00:57:35,321 --> 00:57:40,321
found some water and I was very thirsty
and I put my iodine tablets in my bottle

1025
00:57:41,170 --> 00:57:44,500
and,
and didn't let them dissolve.

1026
00:57:44,501 --> 00:57:46,540
I mean I waited for the
water to turn a little brown,

1027
00:57:46,541 --> 00:57:49,750
but the tablets are still fine in a,
in a drank the water.

1028
00:57:50,560 --> 00:57:54,340
A couple of other guys drank the water
and they both brought up with like a mild

1029
00:57:54,341 --> 00:57:55,540
case of the shits later.

1030
00:57:55,810 --> 00:58:00,810
But because I had the pregnazone
thing is what I like to blame,

1031
00:58:02,380 --> 00:58:06,790
I came down full. Was it the really
serious colon infection? Whoa.

1032
00:58:07,180 --> 00:58:11,530
In wound up. Yeah man. I wound up in the
hospital for four days. Holy Shit. Yeah,

1033
00:58:12,250 --> 00:58:14,830
that's terrifying.
That weighed that I lost so much.

1034
00:58:14,880 --> 00:58:18,490
I don't think I've weighed that amount
since I was 14 I lost so much weight. Wow.

1035
00:58:18,491 --> 00:58:21,340
I'd imagine. And like dude,
if you lose weight, I know.

1036
00:58:21,341 --> 00:58:24,850
I keep thinking like we were joking about
that like selling where you send that

1037
00:58:24,851 --> 00:58:26,580
if you get FDA approval.
Yeah,

1038
00:58:26,650 --> 00:58:31,650
just send water from that Right
Canyon to people as a diet plan.

1039
00:58:32,080 --> 00:58:35,650
Alpha Puke isn't that ridiculous that
people are so God damn week that you have

1040
00:58:35,651 --> 00:58:37,510
to give them some sort of a pathogen,

1041
00:58:37,660 --> 00:58:40,870
some sort of a horrible disease in order
for them to have an excuse to not eat

1042
00:58:40,871 --> 00:58:45,550
like a fucking pig. Now it is. But this,

1043
00:58:45,760 --> 00:58:46,670
I mean this is not,

1044
00:58:46,720 --> 00:58:50,980
I mean this knocked me back in a big
way and really it was kind of the first

1045
00:58:50,981 --> 00:58:53,080
moment when I really
started to feeling my years.

1046
00:58:53,110 --> 00:58:56,650
Like now I feel like a much older man
cause I had never been in a hospital

1047
00:58:56,680 --> 00:58:57,880
except for the day I was born.

1048
00:58:58,570 --> 00:59:00,910
I would imagine it's very
taxing on your immune system.

1049
00:59:00,911 --> 00:59:03,970
Has something like that happen.
I mean it must be just devastating.

1050
00:59:04,120 --> 00:59:08,440
I was beat up man.
I felt like a like a week old man.

1051
00:59:08,441 --> 00:59:10,240
I know prednisone can really fuck you up.

1052
00:59:10,241 --> 00:59:13,270
I have a friend who has sarcoidosis and
that's one of the things they gave him.

1053
00:59:13,271 --> 00:59:16,060
They gave him prednisone. I don't
even know what that is. What is that?

1054
00:59:16,150 --> 00:59:19,780
Some sort of a lung disease early
and I'm not exactly sure what it is,

1055
00:59:20,230 --> 00:59:22,160
but it was, it was, it fucked

1056
00:59:22,160 --> 00:59:25,820
him up bad. He gained a lot of water. He
was, we call the time and just really,

1057
00:59:25,821 --> 00:59:28,910
really didn't enjoy it at all. You could
really tell. The other thing about,

1058
00:59:28,940 --> 00:59:30,230
you know when he loses a lot of weight,

1059
00:59:30,260 --> 00:59:33,680
people can goof on you but they can't
goof on you and you gain a lot of weight.

1060
00:59:34,250 --> 00:59:37,190
So if you lose tons of weight, you'll
walk in the room. People be like,

1061
00:59:37,191 --> 00:59:40,880
you look like shit. Yeah, you look
like Shit, you lost so much weight.

1062
00:59:41,270 --> 00:59:43,510
But if you come in with the gut, they
can't say anything. No. People are going,

1063
00:59:43,520 --> 00:59:46,310
you look like shit. You're really fat.
You can't say that to people, man.

1064
00:59:46,311 --> 00:59:49,570
You live in a strange world.
You live in a different world than May.

1065
00:59:50,450 --> 00:59:53,110
We've Brian walked in and
he and he had a guard.

1066
00:59:53,111 --> 00:59:56,450
We would turn on him like sharks.
Well if you got got bigger,

1067
00:59:56,990 --> 00:59:59,360
if anybody loses way we compliment them.
But yeah,

1068
00:59:59,361 --> 01:00:03,410
if somebody gets fab where like you fat
fuck, what are you eating? Lard all day.

1069
01:00:03,740 --> 01:00:06,230
This is where comedians man,
we don't play nice like that.

1070
01:00:06,260 --> 01:00:08,100
We call it like we see it and we,

1071
01:00:08,210 --> 01:00:09,960
you have to have the ability
to laugh at yourself too.

1072
01:00:09,961 --> 01:00:11,360
Cause some you're going to fuck up too.

1073
01:00:11,540 --> 01:00:13,480
So I should have been hanging out with
you guys when I went through this.

1074
01:00:13,481 --> 01:00:16,670
Cause I had to hear about how bad
I looked. Well yeah, well that's,

1075
01:00:16,671 --> 01:00:18,800
they think that it's okay to say.
I see what you're saying.

1076
01:00:18,801 --> 01:00:21,730
Like it's like culturally
acceptable to talk about someone.

1077
01:00:21,960 --> 01:00:26,450
And he retired about a man who
like almost died. You know, in my,

1078
01:00:27,290 --> 01:00:29,680
I was passing blood.
Well

1079
01:00:30,090 --> 01:00:35,060
to the point where it wasn't
like bloody diarrhea. Oh, it was,

1080
01:00:35,070 --> 01:00:35,491
you could,

1081
01:00:35,491 --> 01:00:38,490
I was thinking about calling the Red
Cross and having them bring some bags down

1082
01:00:38,520 --> 01:00:41,930
and he's bagging it for transfusion rate.

1083
01:00:42,150 --> 01:00:44,880
This blood was straight,
perfect blood.

1084
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:49,560
Oh my God. It was like, I just thought,
why am I, where were you with the Arizona?

1085
01:00:49,561 --> 01:00:52,620
You said they drank this water.
Yeah. Magic was African water.

1086
01:00:52,621 --> 01:00:55,770
You'd be dead right now
unless you're Stephen. Yeah.

1087
01:00:56,070 --> 01:00:58,830
Well he drinks tap water though.
This guy's drinking river water. No,

1088
01:00:58,831 --> 01:01:01,860
but that's a big
difference, man. I believe.

1089
01:01:01,890 --> 01:01:05,730
I believe this guy's on to
something because you know,

1090
01:01:06,870 --> 01:01:10,350
people didn't spend their whole
life having waterborne parasites,

1091
01:01:10,380 --> 01:01:11,250
making them sick.

1092
01:01:11,660 --> 01:01:15,750
You do it and then you like the
ones having high infant mortality.

1093
01:01:15,960 --> 01:01:19,290
So like some kids are born and they,
they don't, they don't get it worked out.

1094
01:01:19,291 --> 01:01:23,580
And some kids are born in water, doesn't
make them sick. Jumping in the jungle,

1095
01:01:23,581 --> 01:01:26,430
water in the wild boys, uh, videos.
That's what we were talking about.

1096
01:01:26,431 --> 01:01:28,770
He was just swimming through the
jungle water and it's like, how are,

1097
01:01:28,830 --> 01:01:29,910
how are you not dying

1098
01:01:29,980 --> 01:01:32,890
if, I guess he wasn't drinking
it, but yeah, you're right.

1099
01:01:32,891 --> 01:01:34,840
Just getting in to see if we
get in there. Well, you know,

1100
01:01:34,841 --> 01:01:39,250
you ever seen that one of those shows
a about um, I forget the name of it.

1101
01:01:39,251 --> 01:01:41,920
It was one of those shows on, I believe
it's on the history channel where they,

1102
01:01:42,030 --> 01:01:46,030
they talk about different pathogens are
different parasites and get into your

1103
01:01:46,031 --> 01:01:49,660
skin and like eventually burrow their
way into your fucking brain and like,

1104
01:01:49,661 --> 01:01:51,420
you know, people don't even realize
there's something wrong with them.

1105
01:01:51,900 --> 01:01:54,820
Headaches and transport four foot
one when you're burning calories,

1106
01:01:54,821 --> 01:01:57,190
they went swimming in Africa.
It's always like,

1107
01:01:57,191 --> 01:02:01,270
well we just happened to be swimming in
some still water in Africa. Like what?

1108
01:02:01,770 --> 01:02:05,260
What the fuck are you doing?
It almost still feel sorry for them,

1109
01:02:05,320 --> 01:02:06,730
but check it out.
They do down there.

1110
01:02:06,731 --> 01:02:09,160
We were talking about in
Ghana they do have that,

1111
01:02:09,460 --> 01:02:14,080
that one that goes up your urethra. Yes.
When you pee. Yeah. It follows your urine,

1112
01:02:14,081 --> 01:02:17,600
the warmth of your urine something and
it goes right into your penis and camps

1113
01:02:17,601 --> 01:02:20,690
and out. That's the real like
that. Totally. We'll get you out.

1114
01:02:20,691 --> 01:02:22,860
Know he's the real deal.
If they can't get it all out,

1115
01:02:22,861 --> 01:02:25,680
they have to split your deck like
a hot dog and go in and clean it.

1116
01:02:25,920 --> 01:02:28,650
You split your hot dogs open.
Some people do and not me.

1117
01:02:28,680 --> 01:02:32,400
And microwave does that for them. So
yeah, it does put a weird little crew.

1118
01:02:32,420 --> 01:02:35,190
That's was when I was a kid.
I used to like to cut the ends.

1119
01:02:35,191 --> 01:02:38,820
I used to like to like it put a little
in the x on the ends and they would

1120
01:02:38,821 --> 01:02:41,280
spread out when you put them on the grill.
I don't know why.

1121
01:02:41,640 --> 01:02:42,720
I Dunno why I liked that.

1122
01:02:42,780 --> 01:02:46,590
I used to like that she'll eat that frozen
or not even like the cook cheese ones

1123
01:02:46,591 --> 01:02:48,500
where the cheese,
they had the cheese in the middle of the

1124
01:02:50,100 --> 01:02:54,960
dance still is going on in
like a fancy pants way now.

1125
01:02:55,350 --> 01:02:57,060
Yeah.
Cheesy dogs.

1126
01:02:57,061 --> 01:03:01,530
But I think now you know how like people
always doing like you take not like an

1127
01:03:01,531 --> 01:03:03,300
old trick and make it new with food,

1128
01:03:03,301 --> 01:03:06,660
but it's kind of like there's like this
sort of retro Foodie kind of thing.

1129
01:03:06,820 --> 01:03:07,410
Right.

1130
01:03:07,410 --> 01:03:11,730
I think there's a retro foodie movement
right now is same way that pot pies got

1131
01:03:11,731 --> 01:03:14,640
fashionable for meatloaf.
It's fashionable.

1132
01:03:14,940 --> 01:03:18,870
I think that there's like artisan
cheese dogs know. Yeah, that's funny.

1133
01:03:18,950 --> 01:03:23,610
Artisan cheese, cheese dogs. A good
hot dog is an underrated thing.

1134
01:03:23,611 --> 01:03:25,620
If you can go to a real good,

1135
01:03:25,680 --> 01:03:29,190
get a real good deli hot dog
from a place that makes her own.

1136
01:03:29,191 --> 01:03:32,160
They really know what the fuck they're
doing and when you bite into it, it snaps.

1137
01:03:32,190 --> 01:03:35,280
You know those hot dogs,
that's an underrated thing.

1138
01:03:35,310 --> 01:03:36,590
That was a bright hot doesn't,
yeah.

1139
01:03:36,591 --> 01:03:40,110
It's not like the typical ones that come
in the packages and you open them up

1140
01:03:40,111 --> 01:03:42,620
and they're all mushy now.
These like you still IX,

1141
01:03:42,690 --> 01:03:46,350
they snap when you bite into a man
and that's a real fucking hot dog.

1142
01:03:46,690 --> 01:03:48,940
When I'm the stylistic for though,
and this might've been, oh,

1143
01:03:48,941 --> 01:03:51,680
you're from the Midwest. All
right. No, no. I grew up in, well,

1144
01:03:51,681 --> 01:03:53,850
I was born in New Jersey
mostly. I grew up in Boston. Oh,

1145
01:03:53,851 --> 01:03:56,450
I thought you guys talking about going
back home though. He's Ohio. He's,

1146
01:03:56,460 --> 01:03:59,790
he's from Ohio. I just got, oh, I'm
really from everywhere. I lived here.

1147
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:02,100
I lived in San Francisco from seven to 11.

1148
01:04:02,101 --> 01:04:06,060
I lived in New Jersey to seven San
Francisco, seven to 11 Florida.

1149
01:04:06,061 --> 01:04:09,900
11 to 1313 to 14 one part of Boston.

1150
01:04:09,901 --> 01:04:14,130
14 to eight 19 another part of Boston.
I smoothed all over the place.

1151
01:04:14,610 --> 01:04:18,270
New York, La. But I've been here more
than anywhere. So when you say back home,

1152
01:04:18,271 --> 01:04:20,130
people don't know what you're talking.
I don't have a back home.

1153
01:04:20,280 --> 01:04:23,070
There's no back home. I guess it would
be Boston. That's where, you know,

1154
01:04:23,071 --> 01:04:26,550
I associated people ask me, you know,
that's where I grew up. That's, you know,

1155
01:04:26,551 --> 01:04:29,130
that's uh,
that's where I started doing comedy.

1156
01:04:29,131 --> 01:04:32,100
That's where everything started for me.
So anything from Joe, lot of Boston,

1157
01:04:32,400 --> 01:04:35,670
I just don't like the winter. Well, the
girls, I mean, and not all the girls,

1158
01:04:35,730 --> 01:04:38,590
most of the girls. What, what
were you discharged? You don't,

1159
01:04:38,610 --> 01:04:42,270
you don't like what you don't like 50%
of the year and you don't like 52% of the

1160
01:04:42,271 --> 01:04:46,440
population has, no, no, no, not
say 50 route 52% is all women.

1161
01:04:46,441 --> 01:04:47,670
That's like saying I don't like all,

1162
01:04:48,510 --> 01:04:50,640
it's not that I don't like
the women in Boston, it's so,

1163
01:04:50,641 --> 01:04:52,830
I don't like some of them.
It's a small percentage.

1164
01:04:52,831 --> 01:04:54,460
It's probably only like
two or three per percent,

1165
01:04:54,780 --> 01:04:55,860
but you're going to run into that yet

1166
01:04:56,050 --> 01:05:01,050
that fuck that Kale outside
the fucking ass hall.

1167
01:05:01,210 --> 01:05:03,750
Nothing's ever going to work out with you

1168
01:05:03,930 --> 01:05:07,230
and they're drunk and they're yelling
at you and it's just do I think you're

1169
01:05:07,231 --> 01:05:10,640
being way generous on that number,
by the way, that's 2% come.

1170
01:05:10,650 --> 01:05:11,490
That's what you gotta do.

1171
01:05:11,880 --> 01:05:15,300
Sometimes you gotta sometimes you
gotta fucking kiss babies. All right,

1172
01:05:15,301 --> 01:05:18,050
I'm being a politician here.
What will you miss?

1173
01:05:18,070 --> 01:05:23,070
[inaudible] the Midwest before it all
fell apart when the use to be able to go,

1174
01:05:24,401 --> 01:05:25,990
if you kept your eyes peeled,

1175
01:05:26,030 --> 01:05:30,730
you'd be able to find gas stations that
would have as many as four hotdogs for a

1176
01:05:30,731 --> 01:05:31,900
dollar.
Oh yeah.

1177
01:05:32,650 --> 01:05:37,180
So that was how bold purchase it was.

1178
01:05:37,181 --> 01:05:39,640
Just a thing that was available,
but you could always,

1179
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:44,830
always get two hot dogs for a
dollar. Wow, that's amazing. It was.

1180
01:05:44,831 --> 01:05:46,720
I noticed the little rollers,
you know what I mean? Oh yeah,

1181
01:05:46,721 --> 01:05:50,200
those seven 11 one so they're just done.
Yeah, and then it had the barn steamer.

1182
01:05:50,230 --> 01:05:52,290
They have a bunch of money.
My brother used to,

1183
01:05:52,340 --> 01:05:54,940
he used to want to get one of those
roller buns, steamers, and just when,

1184
01:05:55,060 --> 01:05:57,190
when like people came
from out of town to visit.

1185
01:05:58,010 --> 01:06:02,210
Just like just load that up, put
the buns and steam and be like, Hey,

1186
01:06:02,380 --> 01:06:04,900
upon steamers house,
everybody's on their own.

1187
01:06:04,901 --> 01:06:09,901
He's really made hot dogs on the
roller bunks or a Costco membership.

1188
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:10,833
I can't tell

1189
01:06:11,520 --> 01:06:14,570
my favorite way to eat, man. We
were just in Brazil and a Ari.

1190
01:06:14,650 --> 01:06:18,990
Oh my pal Ari Shaffir came with me
and we went to a Brazilian steakhouse.

1191
01:06:19,040 --> 01:06:22,470
Was to husker reason really that big
of a difference between Chicago. Damn.

1192
01:06:22,471 --> 01:06:25,470
It was good.
[inaudible] is great for Fau goes great.

1193
01:06:25,720 --> 01:06:30,210
This place was on another level. It
was called Marius Tude. God Damn,

1194
01:06:30,211 --> 01:06:31,800
that food was good.
First of all,

1195
01:06:31,801 --> 01:06:36,000
I just think I've been eating grass
fed beef a lot lately. That's my thing.

1196
01:06:36,001 --> 01:06:39,210
I try to buy grass fed whenever I can
because whole foods usually has a pretty

1197
01:06:39,211 --> 01:06:42,420
good selection of grasp it. It's a little
more expensive, but it tastes different,

1198
01:06:42,421 --> 01:06:45,640
man. It tastes like it's
a world different. It's a
healthy animal, you know,

1199
01:06:46,350 --> 01:06:48,990
I don't know what they're serving them
in Brazil, but it's the right shit.

1200
01:06:49,170 --> 01:06:51,810
That fucking meat was
delicious and they just,

1201
01:06:51,840 --> 01:06:56,040
that's where they created that type
of cooking over fire and they'd bring,

1202
01:06:56,041 --> 01:06:59,160
you know how, what you ask Korea works
for folks who don't know, there's a,

1203
01:06:59,260 --> 01:07:03,900
you get a card and one card is green
and the other side is red and they uh,

1204
01:07:03,901 --> 01:07:05,160
this is how they do it.
And most of them,

1205
01:07:05,190 --> 01:07:06,900
and they come up to your
table and they see green.

1206
01:07:06,901 --> 01:07:08,910
And when you can't take any more,
cause it's all you can eat.

1207
01:07:08,911 --> 01:07:13,810
They just keep coming by with more and
more food on, on, on, on swords, you know,

1208
01:07:13,811 --> 01:07:16,890
and just such cotton slices of meat
off and they give you tongs and you're,

1209
01:07:17,100 --> 01:07:20,070
you're putting you just, it's
an orgy of, of flash. I mean,

1210
01:07:20,071 --> 01:07:23,310
it just gets completely out of control.
I've been a good ones before,

1211
01:07:23,311 --> 01:07:25,880
but this one in Brazil just
kicked all of them and they pick,

1212
01:07:25,980 --> 01:07:30,840
they feed it people zillion barbecue.
Ooh they do man in Rio.

1213
01:07:30,841 --> 01:07:35,000
Rio is a, that's a whole nother world
man. It was a whole nother world that,

1214
01:07:35,001 --> 01:07:38,100
that place looks, first of
all it's like a movie. It me,

1215
01:07:38,101 --> 01:07:42,480
you might as well be an Avatar. You know
when you fly and you see the Jesus on,

1216
01:07:42,481 --> 01:07:45,870
on the top of the mountain and then you
see the favelas and then you see like

1217
01:07:45,871 --> 01:07:50,460
all these people on the beach or
something. What an amazing place we were.

1218
01:07:50,490 --> 01:07:53,760
Me and Ari were all fucked up cause at
the time difference because it's like six

1219
01:07:53,761 --> 01:07:57,330
hours ahead of them.
So like it's seven o'clock in the morning.

1220
01:07:57,331 --> 01:08:00,630
We were up just chilling on the porch
looking at the uh, the, you know,

1221
01:08:00,631 --> 01:08:04,640
these like islands that come out of the
ocean seven o'clock in the morning and

1222
01:08:04,641 --> 01:08:09,570
there's kids playing soccer, like playing
a full game of soccer, early risers,

1223
01:08:09,571 --> 01:08:12,660
man, nobody's watching them. We
saw them show up with their ball,

1224
01:08:12,780 --> 01:08:16,130
like they woke up in the favelas or
wherever the fuck live and nobody,

1225
01:08:16,310 --> 01:08:17,143
no one's watching them.

1226
01:08:17,300 --> 01:08:20,180
They're like nine years old and they
just wandered out onto the beach and they

1227
01:08:20,181 --> 01:08:23,000
all got together and then at one
point in time it started raining.

1228
01:08:23,001 --> 01:08:28,001
So they got under a tree and they were
all singing really nine and 10 years old

1229
01:08:29,590 --> 01:08:33,410
don't work for the tourism commissioner
said, dude it was, it was wild shit dude.

1230
01:08:33,410 --> 01:08:35,840
It was really,
it was a magical thing to watch.

1231
01:08:36,140 --> 01:08:40,370
I was watching all these people show
up either barefoot or in flip flops and

1232
01:08:40,530 --> 01:08:44,120
shorts on and everybody
just looked chill as fuck.

1233
01:08:44,240 --> 01:08:45,770
Everybody was just wandering around.

1234
01:08:45,771 --> 01:08:49,910
There was dudes bringing
big truck fulls of coconuts,

1235
01:08:49,911 --> 01:08:54,680
not truck fulls right away, excuse me,
bike bike baskets, giant bike baskets.

1236
01:08:54,830 --> 01:08:56,270
They all had these bikes.

1237
01:08:56,460 --> 01:09:00,260
Everything got moved around with bikes
like ice and coconuts and they would have

1238
01:09:00,261 --> 01:09:04,160
a bike and at the front of the bike would
be this giant fucking metal basket and

1239
01:09:04,161 --> 01:09:08,180
it would be filled with like, you know,
seven, eight bags of huge bags of ice.

1240
01:09:08,360 --> 01:09:11,600
And these fucking dudes be riding these
things uphill and that's, they did.

1241
01:09:11,601 --> 01:09:15,770
They go all up and down the beach and
sell their eyes and sell their coconuts

1242
01:09:15,771 --> 01:09:19,550
and drop him off and come back and it's
like you're watching another world man,

1243
01:09:19,790 --> 01:09:23,980
and everybody's happy as, fuck. I've heard
all these things about Brazil and push.

1244
01:09:23,981 --> 01:09:28,310
I was really dangerous and don't go
by in heroin in the projects. Okay,

1245
01:09:28,400 --> 01:09:31,190
but if you don't do that,
it's like Copacabana beach.

1246
01:09:31,460 --> 01:09:34,250
That might be one of the most beautiful
things that I've ever seen in my life.

1247
01:09:34,400 --> 01:09:36,530
Everybody just hanging
out or they're like,

1248
01:09:36,531 --> 01:09:39,710
they have the little bars and
little cafes on the beach.

1249
01:09:39,920 --> 01:09:44,150
Everybody's just hanging out laughing
like this isn't like the didn't set this

1250
01:09:44,151 --> 01:09:47,710
up. They're not waiting for my arrival
to put on a show like one of those North

1251
01:09:47,710 --> 01:09:51,860
Korean vice episodes. This is how these
fucking people live every day, all day.

1252
01:09:52,170 --> 01:09:56,500
But that's the spirit of, they're in
the news right now just for the day.

1253
01:09:56,690 --> 01:10:00,380
It's like a renaissance there right
now or that their is exploding. Yeah.

1254
01:10:00,381 --> 01:10:03,710
They're in the middle of having like the
creation of a middle class. You know,

1255
01:10:04,340 --> 01:10:08,120
they're, they're the fifth largest economy
in the world now. I mean, it's amazing,

1256
01:10:08,390 --> 01:10:10,910
but it's, Brazil's exploding. They
have all sorts of natural resources.

1257
01:10:10,911 --> 01:10:13,340
They're just trying to tap into it.
For the longest time it was just like,

1258
01:10:13,341 --> 01:10:15,710
you know,
they still have a logging issue.

1259
01:10:15,711 --> 01:10:18,710
They still have to deal to what we
were talking about before a station.

1260
01:10:18,770 --> 01:10:19,870
That's sad man.
And you,

1261
01:10:19,871 --> 01:10:24,080
you see the conflicts between the loggers
and the poor people that live in these

1262
01:10:24,081 --> 01:10:26,540
villages and it's scary,
scary shit.

1263
01:10:26,600 --> 01:10:29,660
I just think all those dudes
losing their hunting spots. Yeah.

1264
01:10:29,680 --> 01:10:32,990
And they cut those trees down.
Listen, I've never been hunting,

1265
01:10:32,991 --> 01:10:35,030
but I've been wanting to go
hunting for years and years.

1266
01:10:35,031 --> 01:10:37,780
Ricky Schroeder is a buddy of mine and
he's a big hunter and he's always there.

1267
01:10:38,390 --> 01:10:40,770
He's always, oh, he's a huge
hunter. That fucking guy. He goes,

1268
01:10:40,790 --> 01:10:43,970
we just went last week and he went
to Texas. He take, he has two boys.

1269
01:10:44,090 --> 01:10:47,840
One of them is 21 of them is like
1918 and he takes them everywhere.

1270
01:10:47,870 --> 01:10:50,780
It takes them hunting in Africa. It takes
some hunting all over the world. He's a,

1271
01:10:50,781 --> 01:10:55,190
he's a freak. He loves it. And, uh, his,
his wife his best, he's with my wife.

1272
01:10:55,191 --> 01:10:56,510
And so I became friends with them.

1273
01:10:56,511 --> 01:10:58,430
So when we've been threatening
to go hunting forever,

1274
01:10:58,431 --> 01:11:02,590
I'm just ridiculously busy and
I've never put it together. But uh,

1275
01:11:03,180 --> 01:11:06,740
but I, I, I, I think
the ideal way to live,

1276
01:11:07,070 --> 01:11:10,990
I watched a Yo MTV, Yo MTV cribs. No, I'm,

1277
01:11:11,040 --> 01:11:14,430
I'm combining TV raps. I'm
combining two different shows. MTV

1278
01:11:14,430 --> 01:11:17,790
cribs. I watched, uh, you know,

1279
01:11:17,910 --> 01:11:20,280
whatever the fuck it's
called with Ted Nugent.

1280
01:11:20,880 --> 01:11:23,310
He's living in Michigan and
this is what I became a,

1281
01:11:23,311 --> 01:11:27,030
a part of a several year long
fascination with Ted Nugent that I have,

1282
01:11:27,690 --> 01:11:32,040
but he lived in his house in Michigan,
unlike fucking, I don't know how many,

1283
01:11:32,041 --> 01:11:35,730
a thousand acres or some shit, all high
fenced with animals roaming around.

1284
01:11:35,880 --> 01:11:40,800
And he would just get an ATV drive to
his hunting stand and just fuck them up

1285
01:11:40,801 --> 01:11:43,640
all day. And that's where it got
all of the food, but not, yeah,

1286
01:11:43,650 --> 01:11:47,190
but it'd be like if a farmer is no
different than if a farmer woke up,

1287
01:11:47,191 --> 01:11:51,760
went out and shot his cows and acted
like he was hunting them. No, but no,

1288
01:11:51,780 --> 01:11:55,620
but it's way better then than
buying store bought food.

1289
01:11:55,710 --> 01:11:59,850
He's still in an area where
you know that there's animals,

1290
01:12:00,180 --> 01:12:02,580
but that's how he's producing his food.

1291
01:12:02,670 --> 01:12:05,870
I've heard that argument that there's
something not cool about it or not.

1292
01:12:06,330 --> 01:12:09,080
It just becomes an issue of
cheating becomes a Semana.

1293
01:12:09,090 --> 01:12:12,910
It becomes a semantics issue. Right.
So for a real hunter, that's not real.

1294
01:12:14,050 --> 01:12:16,960
It's my brother's a hunter. Okay. Like
my brother Matt, very avid hunter,

1295
01:12:17,290 --> 01:12:20,800
he also has land where
he runs goats and sheep.

1296
01:12:21,790 --> 01:12:24,790
Now when he goes out and
kills a goat or sheep,

1297
01:12:25,330 --> 01:12:28,380
he doesn't say that he went
out hunting. Right. You know,

1298
01:12:28,420 --> 01:12:31,480
cause it just confuses
because hunting's a word that,

1299
01:12:31,510 --> 01:12:35,350
I mean the reason we have languages in
order to be able to discuss complex ideas,

1300
01:12:35,380 --> 01:12:37,120
what is the issue is the issue,

1301
01:12:37,121 --> 01:12:39,040
the fact that the animals
are contained and you know,

1302
01:12:39,041 --> 01:12:40,270
they're definitely going to be there.

1303
01:12:40,390 --> 01:12:40,751
Yeah.

1304
01:12:40,751 --> 01:12:45,751
It becomes like an issue of what I would
say is there's a term that we use in

1305
01:12:47,681 --> 01:12:52,681
the hunting community like fair chase
and it has a pretty pretty solid

1306
01:12:53,621 --> 01:12:55,300
definition of being that um,

1307
01:12:55,660 --> 01:12:59,620
that the animal has a reasonable
chance of alluding capture.

1308
01:13:00,580 --> 01:13:03,070
If you're hunting on a high
wire fence thing, you know,

1309
01:13:03,120 --> 01:13:05,980
like Huntington side fence, the animals,
they're not regardless, fair chase.

1310
01:13:05,981 --> 01:13:10,310
And so various organizations that may be
like record books that would keep side

1311
01:13:10,311 --> 01:13:12,310
like keep track of sizes of animals.

1312
01:13:12,550 --> 01:13:16,000
They might not recognize an animal
killed that way. So you might grow up,

1313
01:13:16,010 --> 01:13:16,780
it would make sense.

1314
01:13:16,780 --> 01:13:21,010
You might grow up in deer on a high
wire fence and Boone and Crockett, um,

1315
01:13:21,100 --> 01:13:25,300
which is uh, a scoring organization
that promotes fair chase ethics.

1316
01:13:25,600 --> 01:13:27,520
They might say like,
we don't,

1317
01:13:27,820 --> 01:13:32,320
we don't welcome an animal taken that
way into our books and we don't even

1318
01:13:32,321 --> 01:13:36,760
really appreciate you using our
scoring system. Right. That,

1319
01:13:36,761 --> 01:13:38,680
that makes sense. And I'm
definitely like, I'm not,

1320
01:13:39,100 --> 01:13:40,390
I'm not familiar with that organization.

1321
01:13:40,391 --> 01:13:43,450
I was saying that that might be something
they would say. Now for me, the the,

1322
01:13:44,020 --> 01:13:48,130
where it becomes an issue for me, and
I'll say that like I grew up in Michigan,

1323
01:13:49,150 --> 01:13:51,790
I've been to Ted Nugent's
annual whiplash bash.

1324
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:54,010
We grew up listening to Fred Barrett.
When I'm in Michigan,

1325
01:13:54,011 --> 01:13:58,300
I still cruise the FM dial hoping to pick
up, you know, stranglehold Wang Dang,

1326
01:13:58,301 --> 01:14:00,820
you know, whatever. I love it all.

1327
01:14:00,821 --> 01:14:05,020
But [inaudible] just done a lot for
hunting isn't a lot to promote hunting.

1328
01:14:05,021 --> 01:14:09,340
He does a lot of great conservation work.
He does a lot of charitable work. Milo,

1329
01:14:09,410 --> 01:14:13,710
the only way I like part with him,
Dunaway I the,

1330
01:14:13,730 --> 01:14:16,140
the thing that he does,
and I don't really understand that,

1331
01:14:16,141 --> 01:14:17,560
I don't understand the high wire.

1332
01:14:18,460 --> 01:14:22,480
I don't really understand like hunting
that way when you could be hunting other

1333
01:14:22,481 --> 01:14:22,900
ways.

1334
01:14:22,900 --> 01:14:27,900
I would never tell a brother that he
can't raise animals on his land and he

1335
01:14:28,331 --> 01:14:30,400
can't raise farm animals
on his land and shoot him.

1336
01:14:30,401 --> 01:14:33,100
I mean it's just not my place to say what
you should be able to do with like an

1337
01:14:33,101 --> 01:14:36,820
illegal sense.
But I do feel a sense,

1338
01:14:36,850 --> 01:14:41,770
I do have like a proprietary sort
of notion or a sense of ownership.

1339
01:14:42,210 --> 01:14:43,043
MMM.

1340
01:14:43,760 --> 01:14:45,300
Over how we use the word hunting.

1341
01:14:45,301 --> 01:14:48,050
So I want to make sure
that when we as a country,

1342
01:14:48,530 --> 01:14:51,530
when we're talking about hunting and
what hunting means and whether hunting's

1343
01:14:51,531 --> 01:14:54,590
right or wrong or what hunter should be
allowed to do and should be allowed to

1344
01:14:54,591 --> 01:14:56,990
do, I just want to make sure that
we're all talking about the same thing.

1345
01:14:57,770 --> 01:15:00,440
And for me,
hunting,

1346
01:15:01,300 --> 01:15:02,133
yeah.

1347
01:15:02,380 --> 01:15:04,870
In this day and age means of,
of fair chase on.

1348
01:15:05,200 --> 01:15:08,260
So when I'm talking about hunting on
top of hunting animals that have a

1349
01:15:08,261 --> 01:15:10,980
reasonable chance to get away
that you're hunting animals. Yeah.

1350
01:15:11,090 --> 01:15:14,750
I can totally understand that. For
personal satisfaction. However,

1351
01:15:14,751 --> 01:15:17,640
if you just trying to
cultivate healthy food and,

1352
01:15:17,680 --> 01:15:22,070
and in control your own environment in
that way where you're self sustaining,

1353
01:15:22,370 --> 01:15:24,230
which is essentially what he's doing,
hunting,

1354
01:15:24,231 --> 01:15:25,910
whatever you want to add on top of that,

1355
01:15:26,090 --> 01:15:30,710
providing to all sorts of
different charities and he
gives me the way constantly

1356
01:15:30,920 --> 01:15:32,730
to, you know, to needy
families and things.

1357
01:15:32,750 --> 01:15:36,680
So it's like he's providing a service
and doing something that he enjoys and

1358
01:15:36,681 --> 01:15:39,650
yeah, you know what they are fenced in
and there are, there are animals there,

1359
01:15:39,651 --> 01:15:42,470
but this is not what you want.
Aren't you trying to get animals?

1360
01:15:42,471 --> 01:15:44,450
Like why is it better if it's hard to do,

1361
01:15:44,750 --> 01:15:47,750
like I understand that there's
some satisfaction while
you would go to the woods

1362
01:15:47,751 --> 01:15:50,470
or fuck track an animal and find
your name, but if you're, if you're,

1363
01:15:50,471 --> 01:15:53,960
what you're trying to do
is be self sufficient and
sustaining life in a natural

1364
01:15:53,961 --> 01:15:56,080
way. Well, if you've got
2000 fucking acres man,

1365
01:15:56,081 --> 01:15:58,730
and you're just sitting there waiting
for an animal to come on and essentially

1366
01:15:58,731 --> 01:16:02,000
it is hunting. You're, you are
hunting, you're not farming,
you know, you're still,

1367
01:16:02,001 --> 01:16:05,900
you still have an actual wild environment
that these animals are living in and

1368
01:16:05,901 --> 01:16:08,660
you invade that environment to,
to provide your family.

1369
01:16:08,661 --> 01:16:10,760
I don't think there's anything wrong
with that. I see what you're saying.

1370
01:16:10,761 --> 01:16:14,480
But it's one of the bunch of using
Cabelas catalog jerking off with fucking

1371
01:16:14,481 --> 01:16:17,540
cammo underwear on, you know like Ooh,
you're putting it, you're put it to me.

1372
01:16:17,541 --> 01:16:19,100
Like I'm saying there's
something wrong with it.

1373
01:16:19,310 --> 01:16:22,420
Well you are sort of saying that you part
ways with him with the high fence that

1374
01:16:22,430 --> 01:16:25,070
you don't think it's fair chase.
No, but yeah, but I'm not saying it,

1375
01:16:25,490 --> 01:16:28,100
I'm not arguing that it should be
illegal or I'm not arguing anything.

1376
01:16:28,100 --> 01:16:31,940
I'm saying it doesn't appeal
to me because it doesn't have,

1377
01:16:33,050 --> 01:16:36,340
it's beyond like Huntington, me
is beyond pragmatism. Like when I,

1378
01:16:36,470 --> 01:16:38,240
when I go out to hunt,
I'm not only thinking,

1379
01:16:38,390 --> 01:16:41,240
oh this is like a way to get food because
that's in a way mental masturbation.

1380
01:16:41,270 --> 01:16:44,040
I have a lot of ways to get
food right, but I can, I can go.

1381
01:16:44,041 --> 01:16:48,230
But if you chose to be self
sufficient and to exist off wild game,

1382
01:16:48,410 --> 01:16:49,950
wouldn't that be the right way to do it?

1383
01:16:49,951 --> 01:16:53,210
Because if you decided to have a fucking
farm, you had 2000 acres and as well,

1384
01:16:53,211 --> 01:16:57,080
you know I'm going to do on a tie these
deer up and this little corral here then

1385
01:16:57,081 --> 01:16:58,940
shoot one in the head every time.
I didn't want to eat one.

1386
01:16:59,360 --> 01:17:03,470
Wouldn't it be better for both the deer
and for you if you allow them three one

1387
01:17:03,471 --> 01:17:06,850
free run, a free range, wild
animal live like they should live.

1388
01:17:06,850 --> 01:17:08,060
So that is hunting though.

1389
01:17:08,061 --> 01:17:12,270
Is it that I would say that it's free
range farming or free range riders.

1390
01:17:12,320 --> 01:17:15,800
I prefer wild game. I really do el
cause like some of my favorite food.

1391
01:17:15,801 --> 01:17:20,050
I love Venison. I like like a gaming
meat. It's delicious to me. Wouldn't,

1392
01:17:20,300 --> 01:17:22,040
I don't say gaming in a negative way.
But you know there's a,

1393
01:17:22,041 --> 01:17:27,041
there's a taste that a wild
animal Brazilian beef because
when you're on a like,

1394
01:17:28,670 --> 01:17:32,030
like animals on a strict grass died,
it takes them longer to come of weight.

1395
01:17:32,480 --> 01:17:36,420
So you might like here in 14 months it,

1396
01:17:36,860 --> 01:17:38,180
if you're finishing a mountain grain,

1397
01:17:38,210 --> 01:17:39,980
you can bring your car to
slaughter weight and you know,

1398
01:17:40,100 --> 01:17:42,670
13 14 million people don't
even know folks. But it takes,

1399
01:17:43,110 --> 01:17:46,310
it takes three years to bring them up.
It could take two years, three years,

1400
01:17:46,311 --> 01:17:47,720
bring them up.
So you're eating the older animal.

1401
01:17:47,780 --> 01:17:49,370
When you go to a supermarket folks,

1402
01:17:49,371 --> 01:17:51,560
and you get a steak and you
see that marbling, you know,

1403
01:17:51,561 --> 01:17:55,130
you see like a delicious ribeye and it's
all filled with fat and they go, Ooh,

1404
01:17:55,131 --> 01:17:58,400
that's gonna be great on the grill.
That's fucking sick animal.

1405
01:17:58,550 --> 01:18:01,940
That's 10 animals sick that animals
eat the shit they shouldn't be eating.

1406
01:18:02,120 --> 01:18:04,010
They're eating some shit they
would never eat in nature.

1407
01:18:04,340 --> 01:18:07,850
They're supposed to be in grass. He's
eaten more than he would eat. Yeah,

1408
01:18:07,851 --> 01:18:09,080
he's eating more than he would eat.
And he's,

1409
01:18:09,220 --> 01:18:12,130
he's eating in a different way and
he's not being exercised. Right.

1410
01:18:12,170 --> 01:18:15,440
And if you're getting cows that
are raised in really cheaply,

1411
01:18:15,441 --> 01:18:18,830
he might actually be eating some
cow protein as well. I mean,

1412
01:18:18,831 --> 01:18:22,190
that's where mad cow disease, he is
come the legal now. But illegal now,

1413
01:18:22,191 --> 01:18:24,440
but it's been done, you know,
but I want to give back.

1414
01:18:24,470 --> 01:18:28,790
I want to really quickly get back
to the idea of of the high fence,

1415
01:18:28,820 --> 01:18:31,010
fair chase hunting grounds and Jason,
listen,

1416
01:18:31,011 --> 01:18:33,610
I'm totally playing devil's advocate.
I know you are,

1417
01:18:33,800 --> 01:18:36,620
and you're raising valid points because
we're talking about two different things.

1418
01:18:36,621 --> 01:18:41,210
You're talking about farming.
Yeah. Hunting on your own spot.

1419
01:18:41,211 --> 01:18:45,230
We know the animals are like it. Listen,
if you have a pond in your backyard,

1420
01:18:45,500 --> 01:18:49,990
they're not, those fish
aren't going anywhere, bitch,
they're just going to sell.

1421
01:18:50,030 --> 01:18:53,380
They're not going anywhere. Man. Fishing,
I think it's fishing, drainage ditch,

1422
01:18:53,381 --> 01:18:56,810
and I say it's still fishing. It's still
fishing. If you have your own pond,

1423
01:18:56,840 --> 01:19:01,280
it's still fishing. You can't say
we're talking about very loose,

1424
01:19:01,281 --> 01:19:04,610
slippery terms. Yeah. I would say
that if you took a Kiddie Pool, okay,

1425
01:19:04,611 --> 01:19:07,730
let's say you have a Kiddie pool and
I throw three or four bluegills in the

1426
01:19:07,730 --> 01:19:10,450
Kiddie Pool, I would not say
I went fishing today. Right?

1427
01:19:10,470 --> 01:19:13,030
Because I caught those blue goes
that I had put into my kitty pool.

1428
01:19:13,040 --> 01:19:15,530
What if it's a pippy comes different?
What if it's upon,

1429
01:19:15,570 --> 01:19:16,860
I would still not call that fishing.

1430
01:19:16,960 --> 01:19:20,870
If I had like a pond in my backyard
that I made, I wouldn't go. Yeah,

1431
01:19:20,871 --> 01:19:25,340
I went fishing today. No, it wouldn't be.
You made pine where I lived in Boston,

1432
01:19:25,341 --> 01:19:29,150
I lived in Newton, Massachusetts
on this street called Ellis Street.

1433
01:19:29,390 --> 01:19:32,600
And if you go down Ellis Street, there's
the Charles River on the left hand side,

1434
01:19:32,750 --> 01:19:34,910
which would have these
monster fucking carp.

1435
01:19:34,940 --> 01:19:37,370
I mean you had never seen like there was,

1436
01:19:37,400 --> 01:19:39,650
there was times when they were spawning
when they were all going to get

1437
01:19:39,651 --> 01:19:42,470
underneath the waterfall.
It was fucking nuts, man.

1438
01:19:42,471 --> 01:19:45,720
Me and my friends would go there and
these be carp that were like, you know,

1439
01:19:45,721 --> 01:19:47,630
as we were like, you know, 13 years old.

1440
01:19:47,631 --> 01:19:49,910
So as far as we could put
our hands out left and right.

1441
01:19:49,970 --> 01:19:52,820
That's how big these fish where they
were an enormous, enormous fish.

1442
01:19:53,000 --> 01:19:58,000
And then down the road just a little
bit was this really tiny bass pond.

1443
01:19:58,640 --> 01:19:59,421
It was tiny,

1444
01:19:59,421 --> 01:20:03,410
but there was a few big basket and like
three and four pound bass in it and they

1445
01:20:03,411 --> 01:20:06,980
would just fucking off all these other
fish and this really small environment,

1446
01:20:07,110 --> 01:20:08,070
but it was still fishing.

1447
01:20:08,070 --> 01:20:10,500
It was hard to catch those fucks.
Yeah, that's what I'm saying.

1448
01:20:10,501 --> 01:20:12,600
It's slippery terms and I can't,
I go fishing.

1449
01:20:13,170 --> 01:20:15,130
I can cast all the way to the other end.
I'd have,

1450
01:20:15,150 --> 01:20:16,830
if I had a one ounce head weight upon,

1451
01:20:16,831 --> 01:20:18,780
it could very well been
fishing and I'll say this,

1452
01:20:18,900 --> 01:20:21,360
and this may be what would help
explain my perspective on this.

1453
01:20:22,050 --> 01:20:24,690
I think that many aspects of what we do,

1454
01:20:24,720 --> 01:20:28,980
like we appreciate challenge and
we appreciate uncertainty. Okay.

1455
01:20:29,730 --> 01:20:34,730
If I go out to hunt on public land or
unfenced lands are uncontrolled lands,

1456
01:20:35,310 --> 01:20:36,240
if I go out to hunt,

1457
01:20:36,330 --> 01:20:41,330
I'm going out knowing that I'm entering
into a complicated relationship,

1458
01:20:43,231 --> 01:20:45,300
a complicated arrangement with the land,

1459
01:20:45,540 --> 01:20:48,510
and there's a very strong chance
that I will not be successful.

1460
01:20:48,960 --> 01:20:50,400
And to overcome that,

1461
01:20:50,670 --> 01:20:54,990
I have to strive and try harder and
concentrate more than be better and

1462
01:20:54,991 --> 01:20:58,320
challenge myself.
So when I fulfill my goal,

1463
01:20:59,160 --> 01:21:03,630
it's knowing that I did it against some
kind of like some kind of adversary,

1464
01:21:03,631 --> 01:21:07,590
which should be the uncertainty of the
landscape of the availability of animals.

1465
01:21:07,740 --> 01:21:11,490
And that I overcame that through
skill and concentration and effort.

1466
01:21:11,760 --> 01:21:15,930
And so when I get that
animal and eat that animal,

1467
01:21:16,590 --> 01:21:20,520
I'm reliving and enjoying that challenge
and the fulfillment of that challenge.

1468
01:21:20,760 --> 01:21:23,610
And I think that people have,

1469
01:21:23,760 --> 01:21:27,600
they do similar things in many ways
where they hunt or not. For instance,

1470
01:21:27,630 --> 01:21:32,250
people go to Italy, right to eat Italian
food. You could just as well argue,

1471
01:21:32,370 --> 01:21:33,660
why would you go all that way?

1472
01:21:33,690 --> 01:21:36,660
Wouldn't it be so much more efficient
just to eat Italian food here?

1473
01:21:36,930 --> 01:21:37,531
And you're like,
yeah,

1474
01:21:37,531 --> 01:21:41,400
but they're ones that being more of
a set of experiences that come with,

1475
01:21:41,460 --> 01:21:42,870
with the reality of it.

1476
01:21:43,200 --> 01:21:48,200
So while I would never say that my
brother shouldn't raise a lamb and then go

1477
01:21:48,271 --> 01:21:49,830
kill it,
he would never,

1478
01:21:49,860 --> 01:21:52,560
because he cares about these terms
and cares about these things.

1479
01:21:52,710 --> 01:21:56,150
He would never bullshit himself and act
like he hunted that he was out hunting

1480
01:21:56,150 --> 01:21:58,910
sheep. I wouldn't do it
naked naked. I'd put,

1481
01:21:59,180 --> 01:22:03,530
I'd put war paint on and shit and I would
hold the knife only in my teeth until

1482
01:22:03,531 --> 01:22:05,770
I got ahold of the actual,
and that wouldn't be hunting.

1483
01:22:05,771 --> 01:22:09,680
That would be you being out being away.
It sounds like with a knife.

1484
01:22:09,710 --> 01:22:11,400
I totally agree with him
and I think when met anyway,

1485
01:22:12,380 --> 01:22:15,430
I'm not saying that should be illegal,
but if you want to get naked with warpage,

1486
01:22:15,440 --> 01:22:18,680
sheep can run and the sheep could
bite than the sheep can fight back.

1487
01:22:18,710 --> 01:22:19,491
If it chooses to,

1488
01:22:19,491 --> 01:22:22,700
let me just kill it because I'm
the Apex Predator of my backyard.

1489
01:22:23,000 --> 01:22:24,920
Well that's the fucking,
that's the sheeps fall.

1490
01:22:24,921 --> 01:22:29,240
What Nugent is pretty much doing is
using a cheat code in a video game. Well,

1491
01:22:29,241 --> 01:22:31,720
he's in a much bigger place
now. He moved to Texas. Yeah,

1492
01:22:31,721 --> 01:22:35,750
I'm fascinated with Ted Nugent. Moved to
another place outside of Waco. A giant,

1493
01:22:35,870 --> 01:22:38,960
much bigger.
Same sort of a situation.

1494
01:22:39,070 --> 01:22:43,130
Do you wanna you wanna hear my Waco deer
hunting story? Sure. Okay. By the way.

1495
01:22:43,160 --> 01:22:45,650
But before you say that Waco,
the way you explain that,

1496
01:22:45,651 --> 01:22:49,010
I just want to say eloquently put, that
was a beautiful way of describing the,

1497
01:22:49,090 --> 01:22:53,040
the, the, the spiritual quest
of hunting and that it's so,

1498
01:22:53,110 --> 01:22:57,650
it's a lot more than just acquiring
food and just a about harvesting and

1499
01:22:57,651 --> 01:23:01,220
cultivating food. It's a whole experience
for you. It's a, it's a, it's a conquest.

1500
01:23:01,221 --> 01:23:06,040
It's a challenge. It's a, it's, there's
a, there's, it is an an ancient game,

1501
01:23:06,370 --> 01:23:09,580
you know, and, and you're, you're
playing it with honor, you know,

1502
01:23:09,581 --> 01:23:12,520
and I totally appreciate that. And then
what I was saying, you know, as I said,

1503
01:23:12,550 --> 01:23:13,383
devil's advocate

1504
01:23:13,460 --> 01:23:14,020
question was though,

1505
01:23:14,020 --> 01:23:16,680
you raise raising valid one and
it's stuff I never thought of it.

1506
01:23:16,681 --> 01:23:18,760
Now I understand.

1507
01:23:18,790 --> 01:23:23,790
I mean like tension surrounding the
issue of hunting has like always existed.

1508
01:23:24,570 --> 01:23:24,860
Know,

1509
01:23:24,860 --> 01:23:28,790
I mean like you look at like the old
testament like Esau and Esau and Jacob.

1510
01:23:28,791 --> 01:23:32,330
I mean it's like right in the beginning
there's been like tension of what,

1511
01:23:32,510 --> 01:23:35,510
you know,
how we all go and get our food.

1512
01:23:35,780 --> 01:23:38,750
We have a responsibility to be cause
we're thinking animals just comes up.

1513
01:23:38,780 --> 01:23:43,460
It's like, so I'm beyond the point
at a time when I used to for a trap,

1514
01:23:43,461 --> 01:23:47,150
I used to do lot of trapping and sell
animals and at the firm market I started

1515
01:23:47,151 --> 01:23:50,930
trapping like very lightly when I was
10 and I was tracking very heavily,

1516
01:23:51,270 --> 01:23:52,850
you know, in, in my early twenties.

1517
01:23:53,180 --> 01:23:56,450
And is that how you learned how to
cook a beaver tail? That was nasty.

1518
01:23:56,451 --> 01:23:59,600
That might be one of the nastiest
whatever. It's interesting to eat that,

1519
01:23:59,601 --> 01:24:03,980
but let me just look at that age. Okay.

1520
01:24:04,680 --> 01:24:09,470
If like my blood would boil when I hear
the word Peter, like I f I just want,

1521
01:24:09,471 --> 01:24:13,250
when I heard like anyone who was
against hunting or trapping or whatever,

1522
01:24:13,610 --> 01:24:16,670
I would just be like,
I just want to like tear into him.

1523
01:24:16,730 --> 01:24:19,600
I was so full of anger about it. Do
you know what I'm saying? Yeah, sure.

1524
01:24:19,640 --> 01:24:23,970
And in some way maybe I didn't understand,
you know,

1525
01:24:24,020 --> 01:24:26,140
my own arguments and stuff,
but now you,

1526
01:24:26,240 --> 01:24:30,440
there's nothing you could say
against hunting would bother.

1527
01:24:30,441 --> 01:24:33,290
You would piss me off. You could
say a lot of things against hunting.

1528
01:24:33,291 --> 01:24:35,600
The dot would be like, well, you
know, there's this way looking at it,

1529
01:24:35,601 --> 01:24:39,080
but there's nothing you could really bring
up that would make mad like whatever.

1530
01:24:39,081 --> 01:24:42,500
Part of my brain used to be able to get
mad at people who don't agree with me.

1531
01:24:42,950 --> 01:24:46,520
It's just gone now. I find him the
coward one is the most fascinating one.

1532
01:24:46,760 --> 01:24:49,550
You know, Oh you coward, you want to
kill innocent animals. I'm like, wow.

1533
01:24:49,670 --> 01:24:52,280
And it's always for people
with leather shoes on and shit.

1534
01:24:52,281 --> 01:24:55,970
It's like my take on animals
has always been I love animals.

1535
01:24:55,971 --> 01:24:57,080
As long as they love me back,

1536
01:24:57,081 --> 01:24:59,930
everybody else is getting eaten
or get the fuck out of my way.

1537
01:25:00,140 --> 01:25:03,290
There's a war going on between
all animals on this planet.

1538
01:25:03,291 --> 01:25:05,420
There's a constant battle for dominance.

1539
01:25:05,630 --> 01:25:09,010
We're just so far ahead of the other
animals that we kind of have forgotten.

1540
01:25:09,011 --> 01:25:11,120
It's a war and we're like
looking out for them,

1541
01:25:11,121 --> 01:25:12,320
looking out for the other animals,

1542
01:25:12,440 --> 01:25:15,350
sometimes more than we're looking out
for 10 people and that's on a regular

1543
01:25:15,351 --> 01:25:19,850
basis. There's a lot of people out
there that are just confused, weird,

1544
01:25:19,851 --> 01:25:24,080
sensitive people that for whatever
reason they couldn't imagine killing and

1545
01:25:24,081 --> 01:25:27,410
eating an animal. And when you don't
realize is how many animals die buying.

1546
01:25:27,411 --> 01:25:32,240
You're getting your fucking lettuce yell
any rabbits and rats and rodents and

1547
01:25:32,241 --> 01:25:36,670
gophers just get chopped up in
those machines that are, that are,

1548
01:25:36,671 --> 01:25:40,700
that are picking various vegetables and
pulling them out of the ground that they

1549
01:25:40,701 --> 01:25:43,700
kill a, an incredible amount of animals.
Every time they harvest veteran,

1550
01:25:43,730 --> 01:25:44,200
well not that,

1551
01:25:44,200 --> 01:25:48,540
but the amount of habitat destruction
that went into creating a farms. It's,

1552
01:25:48,560 --> 01:25:51,440
it's impossible to live a life
that you can drive your self nuts,

1553
01:25:51,441 --> 01:25:53,660
but it's impossible to live a
life without blood on your hands.

1554
01:25:53,820 --> 01:25:57,020
But I'm not sure it must live
a life like I live a life with

1555
01:25:58,790 --> 01:26:03,770
blood on my hands in a much more
like recognizable, visceral way.

1556
01:26:03,920 --> 01:26:07,580
And I think that, you know, I was having
this discussion earlier tonight where,

1557
01:26:08,630 --> 01:26:11,840
you know, Camille Pauley and she's
kind of a, like a provocateur,

1558
01:26:11,870 --> 01:26:13,640
maybe she has this thing,

1559
01:26:13,641 --> 01:26:18,641
she wrote peg and theory of sexuality
and in it she talks to the whole point of

1560
01:26:18,711 --> 01:26:19,544
civilization.

1561
01:26:20,210 --> 01:26:24,890
Like the whole point was to lift us up
from having to dude from being obligated

1562
01:26:24,891 --> 01:26:26,720
to do things we don't want to do.
You know,

1563
01:26:26,721 --> 01:26:29,450
like we don't need to worry about like
what is natural and what's not natural

1564
01:26:29,451 --> 01:26:31,730
because we've had this very
elaborate creation we've made.

1565
01:26:31,880 --> 01:26:35,900
We don't need to treat our own raw sewage.
A lot of us don't fix our own car.

1566
01:26:36,080 --> 01:26:39,320
We don't build our own home. So for
me to sit here and say like, Oh,

1567
01:26:39,321 --> 01:26:41,870
you're not a man if you
don't kill your own food.

1568
01:26:42,050 --> 01:26:44,990
I can't really say that anymore because
there's a lot of things that go into my

1569
01:26:44,991 --> 01:26:47,820
existence that I'm not
doing. You know, there's,

1570
01:26:47,830 --> 01:26:51,920
there's like I'm being supported
by all these things we've created,

1571
01:26:52,100 --> 01:26:55,940
but in this one area I do
choose to still do that.

1572
01:26:55,970 --> 01:26:59,000
And it gives me a connection
into a much broader world.

1573
01:26:59,060 --> 01:27:00,910
I was going to make another
point earlier by camera.

1574
01:27:00,920 --> 01:27:03,680
What the hell is gonna talk about?
Oh my Waco deer hunt story.

1575
01:27:03,681 --> 01:27:05,770
It's not that great of a story.
It's not that great. Well,

1576
01:27:05,780 --> 01:27:08,600
kind of hunting with Ted
[inaudible] who was a cannon.

1577
01:27:09,110 --> 01:27:12,770
So I was not near Waco and, and,
and I was just like the guests,

1578
01:27:12,771 --> 01:27:15,680
I was actually visiting and I want to
be in that they have, they're like, oh,

1579
01:27:15,681 --> 01:27:19,400
we'll have Bob over the neighbor. Bob.
Bob Likes to hunt you and Bob can talk.

1580
01:27:19,730 --> 01:27:21,950
Bob escaped from the camp.
Remember back when they burned it.

1581
01:27:22,400 --> 01:27:25,460
So tell him how he got out. All
right. Shot my shelf. I'll fed.

1582
01:27:25,610 --> 01:27:28,690
So Bob tells me we'll,

1583
01:27:28,691 --> 01:27:31,820
we'll go hunting in the morning and Bob
takes me out and we drive out into the

1584
01:27:31,821 --> 01:27:34,760
dark on this farm and
Waco and he tells me,

1585
01:27:34,970 --> 01:27:37,580
he dropped me off at this ladder stand,
which is like a plant,

1586
01:27:37,581 --> 01:27:39,430
like a prison guard platform.

1587
01:27:39,440 --> 01:27:42,500
Then you climb up in there and he tells
me that feeders or kick on at seven.

1588
01:27:42,710 --> 01:27:45,710
And I honestly, I was so naive at the
planet and he know what this meant, but,

1589
01:27:45,770 --> 01:27:50,280
but he has an automatic feeder,
so the animals just worn out.

1590
01:27:50,590 --> 01:27:53,480
It spits corn out at seven.
How do you feel about that?

1591
01:27:53,481 --> 01:27:57,380
About people planting food? That's of
course the same thing. Right? Well,

1592
01:27:57,620 --> 01:28:01,200
that he see, I could tell that
you're like, uh, you're, you're,

1593
01:28:01,260 --> 01:28:04,130
you're a professional
interviewer because I'm not even,

1594
01:28:04,160 --> 01:28:08,470
this is the first time we were near
Hobby interview because you're, you're,

1595
01:28:08,480 --> 01:28:11,840
you're, you're narrowing your
questions down in such a fine point.

1596
01:28:11,841 --> 01:28:15,440
Where within the hunting world,
let me fix my Waco story.

1597
01:28:15,680 --> 01:28:17,650
The don't forget what you just
asked me. No, well it's, it's,

1598
01:28:18,280 --> 01:28:19,610
you're saying that the feeders,
come on,

1599
01:28:19,860 --> 01:28:24,860
we'll get the kick on at seven at 6:55
AM dear start coming out of the woods in

1600
01:28:26,941 --> 01:28:30,770
converging on the thing for the seven
o'clock feed session. Oh my God.

1601
01:28:32,540 --> 01:28:36,830
I said to myself at that, at
that moment, I said, I cannot,

1602
01:28:37,370 --> 01:28:40,640
I will not kill a deer under
these circumstances. Wow.

1603
01:28:40,700 --> 01:28:44,450
So I want to killed every
one of those dumb fucks.

1604
01:28:44,451 --> 01:28:46,160
But it's driven by,

1605
01:28:46,190 --> 01:28:51,190
it's like it to me
violated a sort of packed.

1606
01:28:52,550 --> 01:28:54,910
I understand. Do you understand?
Yeah, no, totally. I'm on now.

1607
01:28:54,970 --> 01:28:56,280
When you ask about planning food,

1608
01:28:56,320 --> 01:28:59,600
you're going to need an interesting thing
because a thing in hunting used to be,

1609
01:28:59,601 --> 01:29:00,710
there used to be a lot more,

1610
01:29:00,920 --> 01:29:05,040
she's a lot more one thing in a do you
just take bait out and put it in a feeder

1611
01:29:05,041 --> 01:29:06,340
and dump it in the woods.
Right.

1612
01:29:07,260 --> 01:29:10,290
And in some places that it's
illegal someplaces it's frowned on.

1613
01:29:10,291 --> 01:29:12,070
In some places it's legal
and perfectly acceptable.

1614
01:29:12,090 --> 01:29:14,760
Depends on culturally how people
do things. Where you're from.

1615
01:29:15,930 --> 01:29:20,160
Another version of that is that you just
have honest to goodness agricultural

1616
01:29:20,161 --> 01:29:22,110
lands.
So that would be,

1617
01:29:22,111 --> 01:29:26,880
that was a cornfield that there where
they raise corn to sell and to market and

1618
01:29:26,881 --> 01:29:31,090
deer are drawn to this and you go and sit
on the edge of this cornfield and hunt

1619
01:29:31,091 --> 01:29:34,170
deer.
And so a lot of guys that might do that,

1620
01:29:34,171 --> 01:29:37,500
they might sit like an apple orchard or
an Alfalfa field or on the edge of the

1621
01:29:37,520 --> 01:29:40,440
cornfield and they would say,
oh,

1622
01:29:40,500 --> 01:29:44,670
I don't agree with baiting dear the way
you do it where you just don't the corn

1623
01:29:44,671 --> 01:29:48,600
in the woods, but me sitting
on a Cornfield as legitimate.

1624
01:29:49,320 --> 01:29:50,153
Oh I see.

1625
01:29:50,250 --> 01:29:54,210
I've watched a hunting shows where they
show you how to grow crops that are

1626
01:29:54,211 --> 01:29:58,150
going to attract this and this broad
on in some areas where they banned like

1627
01:29:58,170 --> 01:30:02,190
maybe it's illegal bait, it's illegal
to donate to have a big machine.

1628
01:30:02,191 --> 01:30:03,460
It just unloads corn.

1629
01:30:04,300 --> 01:30:09,300
Then is you plant a like pho agricultural
crop call a food plot and you might

1630
01:30:10,771 --> 01:30:14,190
plan it with no intent to harvest,
but you plan it.

1631
01:30:14,220 --> 01:30:18,390
So you plan a little Alfalfa patch and
animals come on and it winds up being

1632
01:30:18,420 --> 01:30:22,320
just as bad. No, no, I'm not saying
that as it being, it's like a grain.

1633
01:30:22,350 --> 01:30:26,810
It grays, the area of what? So in the
hunt, in the hunting community of,

1634
01:30:26,811 --> 01:30:31,140
of people who are think about these
things and they're always weighing like,

1635
01:30:31,320 --> 01:30:36,180
how can we continue to have a sustainable
relationship with our resources in

1636
01:30:36,181 --> 01:30:39,420
light of changing technologies the
same way it becomes really difficult to

1637
01:30:39,421 --> 01:30:43,770
interpret the constitution because
we look at it like, okay, you know,

1638
01:30:43,920 --> 01:30:47,910
right to bear arms, but did that mean
you can have a howitzer? You know?

1639
01:30:47,911 --> 01:30:50,250
So we're always like going like,
things have changed.

1640
01:30:50,251 --> 01:30:53,160
So now what do we do in hunting or eyes
looking at these things that change.

1641
01:30:53,161 --> 01:30:56,370
Like people just hadn't fought.
I mean, people had historically,

1642
01:30:56,371 --> 01:31:01,371
but it wasn't widespread practice to
grow bait out in the woods and now it

1643
01:31:02,221 --> 01:31:05,310
isn't. So it becomes a debate, like
how do we, how do you feel about that?

1644
01:31:05,340 --> 01:31:08,030
How about you don't, you're
not for the planters, you know,

1645
01:31:08,040 --> 01:31:11,540
for the food that just dumps it out at
any given time. Whatever you call it. Not,

1646
01:31:11,700 --> 01:31:15,060
not for it. It's not appealing
to me. Like that's not how,

1647
01:31:15,120 --> 01:31:16,760
that's not how I like to hunt.
Yeah.

1648
01:31:16,770 --> 01:31:21,720
It's the same thing as if I
fishy in bucket. I, yeah. Again,

1649
01:31:21,721 --> 01:31:26,721
I would never say I would never advocate
that it'd be abolished because we

1650
01:31:27,061 --> 01:31:29,940
control, like we have ways
that we regulate honeymoon,

1651
01:31:29,941 --> 01:31:33,450
regulate hunting through season length
through how many harvests tickets are

1652
01:31:33,451 --> 01:31:35,970
allowed. But there's a plane
way that we can control harvest.

1653
01:31:35,971 --> 01:31:39,840
So as long as a group of people aren't,
you know,

1654
01:31:39,900 --> 01:31:44,880
damaging a resource irreparably, I'm
not going to then go and say like, Oh,

1655
01:31:44,881 --> 01:31:47,670
you should do this way and the way I
hunt. Right. And the way you hunts wrong.

1656
01:31:48,030 --> 01:31:51,840
But it has to be the kind of hunting
that's most rewarding to me and that I

1657
01:31:51,841 --> 01:31:56,580
spend my time doing is I like
to hunt bigger tracks of land,

1658
01:31:57,510 --> 01:32:00,130
more physically grueling hunts.
I like to be.

1659
01:32:00,131 --> 01:32:04,960
Why are more where it brings more of
an immersion into a wilderness setting

1660
01:32:05,140 --> 01:32:10,140
where it really draws on more skills
on my part where I feel more um,

1661
01:32:11,240 --> 01:32:13,210
engrossed. I like to get, like,

1662
01:32:13,211 --> 01:32:18,070
I feel like I'm really hunting when I
get to a point where no other thought

1663
01:32:18,130 --> 01:32:20,110
invades my mind.
Okay.

1664
01:32:20,320 --> 01:32:23,770
If I could get into a situation
where I'm not being like, oh,

1665
01:32:23,771 --> 01:32:26,410
I forgot to call my mom again, you know,
I should really call my mom next Sunday.

1666
01:32:26,590 --> 01:32:31,590
Like when I can get away from any
thought and I'm just strictly doing that.

1667
01:32:32,920 --> 01:32:33,490
Yeah.

1668
01:32:33,490 --> 01:32:35,280
That's what I feel. Right. You know?

1669
01:32:35,320 --> 01:32:39,460
And so that's Kinda like what I'm
pursuing in really. I'll go through,

1670
01:32:40,600 --> 01:32:43,900
you know, when I'm home. So if I'm not
traveling a lot and I'm home, I'll eat,

1671
01:32:43,960 --> 01:32:45,760
you know,
pound or more game meat.

1672
01:32:47,020 --> 01:32:51,340
My wife eats slightly less than that per
day. If I'm cooking dinner for her, um,

1673
01:32:51,880 --> 01:32:55,480
you know, we'll go through my, I give a
lot of way. So when I go into my year,

1674
01:32:55,481 --> 01:33:00,310
I'm always looking at what I
can really go through. Well,

1675
01:33:00,350 --> 01:33:04,280
how much meat can I actually can? How much
do you eat from a supermarket? I don't,

1676
01:33:04,420 --> 01:33:08,290
well, from a supermarket, I don't eat
any meat. I'll eat meat in restaurants.

1677
01:33:08,291 --> 01:33:09,071
I eat in restaurants,

1678
01:33:09,071 --> 01:33:12,670
but I would never buy meat
in the supermarket and
bring it into my house. Wow.

1679
01:33:12,760 --> 01:33:15,940
Nah, we just, he gave me but I
have like tons of great gaming.

1680
01:33:15,940 --> 01:33:19,060
I know how to handle it well. So that's
what we eat. How long does it stay? Good.

1681
01:33:19,690 --> 01:33:24,690
I'll usually on the long end I will
keep me in my deep freezer for one year.

1682
01:33:26,890 --> 01:33:30,760
I don't let things go longer one
year cause I generally practice a,

1683
01:33:30,880 --> 01:33:34,020
was it last in first out.
So the,

1684
01:33:34,040 --> 01:33:38,680
the animals are harvested
this year, September, October,
November, hunting seasons.

1685
01:33:39,520 --> 01:33:43,030
I don't get into those until
I've finished last year stuff.

1686
01:33:43,240 --> 01:33:48,100
So when I get into the, to the mid summer
I might give away a lot of game meat.

1687
01:33:48,670 --> 01:33:52,540
You know, maybe I'll give away 40 pounds
or 50 pounds a game, eat to friends.

1688
01:33:52,541 --> 01:33:56,650
I know who use it well cause then I'm
trying to clear out my stores knowing that

1689
01:33:56,651 --> 01:33:59,020
I'm going to be coming into a
new season of a lot more. But,

1690
01:33:59,021 --> 01:34:00,930
but the reason I brought this up was it,

1691
01:34:01,390 --> 01:34:03,670
there's a finite amount
that I need the non abuse.

1692
01:34:04,000 --> 01:34:08,110
So if I know that I can achieve that goal,
which is my primary goal,

1693
01:34:08,111 --> 01:34:11,200
to build a feed myself on game me,
then I,

1694
01:34:11,201 --> 01:34:15,550
then I start thinking about
the quality of those hunts.

1695
01:34:15,850 --> 01:34:16,630
Do you know what I'm saying?

1696
01:34:16,630 --> 01:34:21,630
Like if you told me you could
go to location a and kill
an elk in an hour or you

1697
01:34:23,711 --> 01:34:28,120
could go to location B and work your
ass off and kill an elk in 10 days,

1698
01:34:30,520 --> 01:34:33,250
this is going to sound like I'm, I'm
telling you bs about really would pick B.

1699
01:34:33,880 --> 01:34:36,340
That doesn't sound like bs
at all because I'd be like,

1700
01:34:36,341 --> 01:34:37,300
well that sounds like an amazing,

1701
01:34:37,301 --> 01:34:40,330
that sounds like an amazing trip and
I'm going to come out of it with stories

1702
01:34:40,331 --> 01:34:44,110
and things that happened and I still
will wind up with my, you know,

1703
01:34:44,350 --> 01:34:47,560
150 200 pounds, 300 pounds
depending on the size of the elk,

1704
01:34:47,890 --> 01:34:51,400
elk meat that I know I'm going to
use. So I just get more, you know,

1705
01:34:51,430 --> 01:34:54,370
how much does it affect the flavor
of the animal when you freeze it,

1706
01:34:56,740 --> 01:34:59,630
not adverse. There's a lot of
misconceptions about freeze and meat.

1707
01:35:02,320 --> 01:35:04,230
Meet. We'll hear from
her. The term of aging.

1708
01:35:04,380 --> 01:35:08,250
Yes you meet will still age in a freezer,
not still meet,

1709
01:35:08,251 --> 01:35:12,060
will age and freeze it like there's some
breakdown and the breakdown of me is

1710
01:35:12,120 --> 01:35:17,120
particularly obvious when you look at the
way fat because fat will actually in a

1711
01:35:18,110 --> 01:35:20,990
longterm it'll rot in the freezer. If
you take a really fat, like you take,

1712
01:35:21,000 --> 01:35:23,940
let's say you take a pork chop and
it's got a big band of fat on it,

1713
01:35:24,300 --> 01:35:27,450
you put that thing in your freezer
for a year. When you pull it out,

1714
01:35:27,720 --> 01:35:31,380
that band of fat is going to have,
it's going to probably have yellowed.

1715
01:35:31,740 --> 01:35:36,360
It might even smell rancid. Even those in
the freezer and the meat would be fine.

1716
01:35:36,600 --> 01:35:41,040
So when I put games and game meat fat,
like on the Deere family particularly,

1717
01:35:41,041 --> 01:35:44,070
we call it tallow. It's a difference, a
very waxy. It's a different kind of fat.

1718
01:35:44,970 --> 01:35:49,470
That stuff really does not do well in
a freezer and it's not even good fresh.

1719
01:35:49,890 --> 01:35:53,550
It has a very low melt point. So
Hi Mel points. So when you eat it,

1720
01:35:53,620 --> 01:35:57,750
you take a hot piece and eat it.
It solidifies in your mouth,

1721
01:35:57,870 --> 01:36:00,510
like coats your roof, your mouth
with that wax and kind of stuff.

1722
01:36:01,170 --> 01:36:02,790
People just generally to trim it off.

1723
01:36:03,180 --> 01:36:08,180
If I take a good piece of meat and trim
it and put it in my freezer or a year or

1724
01:36:08,341 --> 01:36:11,490
I took a piece and trend to put in my
freezer three months and I gave you a

1725
01:36:11,491 --> 01:36:14,660
Pepsi challenge between three months and
12 months. There's no way you'd pick,

1726
01:36:14,970 --> 01:36:18,510
there's no way you'd pick it out.
That's in a deep freeze. And that's,

1727
01:36:18,540 --> 01:36:22,710
and I wrap all my games, very care. If
I do a very tight layer of plastic wrap,

1728
01:36:22,740 --> 01:36:24,720
squeeze all the air and
like get it really good.

1729
01:36:24,720 --> 01:36:29,190
And then I do it in wax freezer paper
and then I keep it in a freezer at a low

1730
01:36:29,191 --> 01:36:33,900
setting. So you'd, is it a vacuum
seal? No, I don't. I don't like those.

1731
01:36:33,930 --> 01:36:36,000
How come?
Because the bags get punctured.

1732
01:36:36,330 --> 01:36:40,590
If you know that everyone's going to be
wearing like velvet gloves and no one's

1733
01:36:40,591 --> 01:36:44,040
going to be moving this stuff
around, they're great. But even,

1734
01:36:44,070 --> 01:36:47,790
but those bags is rubbing against each
other or someone's like carelessly.

1735
01:36:47,791 --> 01:36:50,010
You know how when you're rummaging
through your freezer and looking for

1736
01:36:50,011 --> 01:36:51,680
something to rummage through your fridge,
look in the phone,

1737
01:36:52,160 --> 01:36:54,060
you puncture those bags in the bag,

1738
01:36:54,061 --> 01:36:57,540
relies on the seal so the minute you
puncture it you wait a while later and you

1739
01:36:57,541 --> 01:37:00,840
just have like a big loose bag full of
ice crystals and freezer burned stuff.

1740
01:37:00,870 --> 01:37:03,360
It just isn't like archival
the way I want it to be.

1741
01:37:03,360 --> 01:37:06,180
And I've dinked around with
different packaging like that.

1742
01:37:06,181 --> 01:37:09,420
Have you tried double layers, like the
vacuum seal and then yeah, it's just,

1743
01:37:10,070 --> 01:37:14,310
and like for speed issues, if I had a
way that they didn't ever get punctured,

1744
01:37:14,640 --> 01:37:19,200
I would use them more. But for me I
just, even when I've had them work,

1745
01:37:19,230 --> 01:37:23,640
I just haven't seen that for the way I
handle it in the way I go through it and

1746
01:37:23,641 --> 01:37:25,290
the way I store it and what I store.

1747
01:37:25,560 --> 01:37:29,880
I have not seen that it works any
better even when it's perfect.

1748
01:37:30,030 --> 01:37:32,040
It doesn't work any better
than how I like to wrap it.

1749
01:37:32,310 --> 01:37:35,760
And the way I like to wrap it definitely
works better in the long run cause it

1750
01:37:35,761 --> 01:37:37,770
doesn't wind up getting
punctured and full ice crystals.

1751
01:37:37,860 --> 01:37:39,270
How long have you been living like this?

1752
01:37:40,510 --> 01:37:41,310
Yeah,

1753
01:37:41,310 --> 01:37:41,820
you know,

1754
01:37:41,820 --> 01:37:45,480
I grew up like my father was a big hunter
and we grew up doing a lot of hunting

1755
01:37:45,481 --> 01:37:47,940
and fishing. I started fishing when
I was, you know, three or four.

1756
01:37:47,941 --> 01:37:49,800
I started hunting at
seven or eight years old,

1757
01:37:49,980 --> 01:37:52,710
killed my first deer and I was 13 and
started hunting deer and I was 11.

1758
01:37:53,010 --> 01:37:57,720
We always ate a lot of deer meat, but
we have, we didn't live a conscientious,

1759
01:37:57,721 --> 01:38:01,620
we hadn't made a conscientious
decision to just eat game. We just,

1760
01:38:01,621 --> 01:38:04,850
we had a lot of it and
ate a lot of it but,

1761
01:38:05,210 --> 01:38:09,180
but we didn't look at eating that
differently than, than eating beef.

1762
01:38:09,181 --> 01:38:12,510
And you'd go in our freezer anytime
you'd find a wide array of meats.

1763
01:38:12,900 --> 01:38:16,680
When I left home to go to college, I went
to college in Sioux St Marie, Michigan,

1764
01:38:17,060 --> 01:38:20,790
um, w with a lot of phenomenal hunting
around Lake Superior State University.

1765
01:38:20,790 --> 01:38:24,450
And we were all very, like my
friends. And I were very skilled,

1766
01:38:25,110 --> 01:38:26,940
pretty seasoned hunters by that point.

1767
01:38:27,090 --> 01:38:29,520
And we were broke the way you
are when you go to college.

1768
01:38:29,880 --> 01:38:32,300
And we found that we could,
uh,

1769
01:38:32,520 --> 01:38:37,140
just kill deer and eat them
and we would buy, we would eat.

1770
01:38:37,170 --> 01:38:39,570
I remember me and my two roommates,

1771
01:38:39,600 --> 01:38:43,380
we went through four deer between
October one in the beginning of Christmas

1772
01:38:43,381 --> 01:38:46,020
break. So wow. So like December 15th,

1773
01:38:46,021 --> 01:38:48,210
October one to seven for dear
parties at your house. We,

1774
01:38:48,211 --> 01:38:51,870
our mantra was burgers for lunch, steaks
for dinner. I mean, we're burgers,

1775
01:38:51,900 --> 01:38:52,890
we would just eat.
Yeah.

1776
01:38:52,891 --> 01:38:56,070
We eat ground meat at lunch and
we fished a lot of salmon, right.

1777
01:38:56,100 --> 01:38:58,530
Because the Saint Mary's river
is falls right through town.

1778
01:38:58,560 --> 01:39:02,070
We'd fish salmon out of that.
And that was the first time that I,

1779
01:39:02,190 --> 01:39:04,600
that I started to live that way.
And I mean,

1780
01:39:04,601 --> 01:39:09,570
and I began to live that way
just as out of necessity.

1781
01:39:09,750 --> 01:39:14,550
But then necessity dovetailed or like
blended very quickly into a lifestyle

1782
01:39:14,551 --> 01:39:18,090
choice. Like one month into that or
let's say that first year we did that.

1783
01:39:18,091 --> 01:39:22,230
So December 15th, um, you know,
we finished that fourth year.

1784
01:39:22,440 --> 01:39:25,830
At that point if you,
if you had, you know,

1785
01:39:25,831 --> 01:39:28,200
like of God had come down
and giving me $1 million,

1786
01:39:29,790 --> 01:39:33,090
a lot of things would've changed.
Diet would not have changed at that.

1787
01:39:33,120 --> 01:39:35,720
I fell so in love so quickly with that,

1788
01:39:35,730 --> 01:39:39,600
just like very deliberate style
and we have, you know, as humans,

1789
01:39:39,601 --> 01:39:43,500
like you alluded this tour to this earlier
where we have a lot of energy and a

1790
01:39:43,501 --> 01:39:46,470
lot of physical attributes and physical
skills that we just don't need to use

1791
01:39:46,471 --> 01:39:51,471
anymore because the things we've done
and it makes me very happy and feel very

1792
01:39:51,901 --> 01:39:53,430
fulfilled just to do that.

1793
01:39:53,640 --> 01:39:57,240
And I'm not and I don't like go out and
say it that it would do the same thing

1794
01:39:57,241 --> 01:39:57,541
to you.

1795
01:39:57,541 --> 01:40:02,040
Like I don't like to be where I don't
like the sound or be in a position where

1796
01:40:02,041 --> 01:40:04,050
I'm telling people where I'm
advocating to people like, Oh,

1797
01:40:04,051 --> 01:40:06,690
if you're unhappy you'll find
tremendous happiness by hunting.

1798
01:40:06,960 --> 01:40:09,720
I'm just saying for me it was,

1799
01:40:09,780 --> 01:40:12,230
it changed my life and gave me a sense of,

1800
01:40:12,330 --> 01:40:17,330
of purpose and fulfillment that is matched
now only buy like professional things

1801
01:40:18,031 --> 01:40:20,160
and my family things.
It's on that level for me.

1802
01:40:20,161 --> 01:40:22,510
So I've just lived that way since then.
Whoa.

1803
01:40:22,550 --> 01:40:24,320
Ever watched any of the vice stuff?

1804
01:40:24,350 --> 01:40:28,370
vice.com and read any of their
magazines or any of that stuff? No,

1805
01:40:28,400 --> 01:40:31,440
there's a company called vice know.
I have one other out,

1806
01:40:31,450 --> 01:40:34,550
cause my agent represents the
author who published a device. They,

1807
01:40:34,610 --> 01:40:39,610
they put out some wild shit and one of
them was called Heimos Arctic refuge and

1808
01:40:40,170 --> 01:40:43,850
Hyman. Yeah. He lives in the
upper right. There's a whole,

1809
01:40:43,880 --> 01:40:46,000
but there's a book about him
too though. Is it really? Yeah.

1810
01:40:46,060 --> 01:40:49,580
There's a book about him. Well, hi Mo. I
can't remember his last year. Couth yeah,

1811
01:40:49,910 --> 01:40:53,560
that's right. Yeah, that's right. Yeah.
They followed this dude up in, uh,

1812
01:40:54,160 --> 01:40:56,740
you know he's in like North
East Alaska, right? Yeah.

1813
01:40:56,800 --> 01:41:00,490
They did this after this book came out.
It's a phenomenal book, man. Really? Well,

1814
01:41:00,491 --> 01:41:03,120
he's, he's an amazing cat man. It's a,

1815
01:41:03,490 --> 01:41:08,260
this guy is just walking around out there.
He doesn't have a car. He doesn't have,

1816
01:41:08,261 --> 01:41:13,080
I mean he's got a little hot, which is,
you know, something that he has built. Oh,

1817
01:41:13,290 --> 01:41:16,300
it's basically a log house.
He traps for the third markets.

1818
01:41:16,420 --> 01:41:21,040
He traps and he shoots Caribou and
he fishes and you know, and he's,

1819
01:41:21,100 --> 01:41:23,290
he's a very smart guy. He's
not an idiot, you know,

1820
01:41:23,291 --> 01:41:26,860
he said he's never around much people be,
could be besides his wife,

1821
01:41:27,070 --> 01:41:31,380
but he was talking about how he believes
that, you know, he's a very, he's a,

1822
01:41:31,381 --> 01:41:34,930
he's really happy and he thinks that
this is how a man is supposed to live.

1823
01:41:34,931 --> 01:41:36,460
The man is supposed to live a,

1824
01:41:36,640 --> 01:41:40,210
a hunter gatherer existence and
then there's a genetic connection.

1825
01:41:40,210 --> 01:41:42,640
May Be even he was
insinuating that this is like,

1826
01:41:42,641 --> 01:41:46,150
it's something in our DNA that
satisfied at a living like that.

1827
01:41:46,330 --> 01:41:49,190
And most people that are depressed
and most people that are,

1828
01:41:49,191 --> 01:41:52,790
that are bummed out and they live in
a a really unfulfilling life. I mean,

1829
01:41:52,810 --> 01:41:55,320
think about what they're doing.
And W W you're,

1830
01:41:55,321 --> 01:41:59,860
your body's set up to get all these
sort of biological rewards from sex,

1831
01:41:59,980 --> 01:42:03,940
from acquiring food, from a acquiring,
physical success, whatever the,

1832
01:42:03,970 --> 01:42:07,420
whatever it is that it's difficult to
acquire, your body gets these rewards.

1833
01:42:08,110 --> 01:42:10,720
If all the sudden you're in a cubicle
and every day it's just the same stupid

1834
01:42:10,721 --> 01:42:13,530
shit. There's no rewards,
there's no nothing, there's no,

1835
01:42:13,790 --> 01:42:17,770
none of those biological needs,
those holes and those holes are filled in.

1836
01:42:18,190 --> 01:42:22,680
You know, we've, we've really created
a very, very strange society that, uh,

1837
01:42:22,720 --> 01:42:25,810
very few people have been
able to navigate successfully.

1838
01:42:26,050 --> 01:42:29,320
It's almost like we've got this really
complicated thing that we have to run,

1839
01:42:29,321 --> 01:42:33,270
but with no handbook. And so almost
everyone's doing it wrong, you know,

1840
01:42:33,280 --> 01:42:35,920
and almost everyone's doing it
wrong for the, for the human body.

1841
01:42:36,020 --> 01:42:40,880
Your windup was surprise things too.
Like the other night before I came here,

1842
01:42:40,881 --> 01:42:41,351
we were trying,

1843
01:42:41,351 --> 01:42:46,351
my wife and our busily trying to find
sources of drafts in our home because we

1844
01:42:48,771 --> 01:42:52,370
had a good cold snap.
And you know,

1845
01:42:52,371 --> 01:42:56,300
we have like a lot of obligations and
somewhat complicated lives and a lot of

1846
01:42:56,301 --> 01:42:57,134
things we're trying to do.

1847
01:42:57,380 --> 01:43:01,280
But we spent the entire afternoon
blocking up drafts as we were because like

1848
01:43:01,310 --> 01:43:06,310
that night after blocking up drafts there
was kind of like this or of happiness

1849
01:43:06,861 --> 01:43:10,670
and be kind of like got along in a
different way than we normally get along

1850
01:43:10,910 --> 01:43:12,800
having like accomplish this,

1851
01:43:13,760 --> 01:43:16,680
this issue of maintaining our
homes and like she'd be warm.

1852
01:43:16,710 --> 01:43:19,040
It was like we kind of like
just got launched into this.

1853
01:43:19,400 --> 01:43:22,560
This is something that was like just
like older and different, you know, and,

1854
01:43:22,590 --> 01:43:24,700
and it's interesting you bring up the,
the,

1855
01:43:24,760 --> 01:43:28,150
the guy that makes his living
as a fur trapper, you know,

1856
01:43:28,160 --> 01:43:29,900
gets his cash income from,
for traffic.

1857
01:43:30,260 --> 01:43:34,520
Because when I trapped
for it really made me,

1858
01:43:36,110 --> 01:43:40,370
I became kind of miserable trapping for
because I got into for trapping at a

1859
01:43:40,371 --> 01:43:42,650
time when for prices were pretty high.
Okay.

1860
01:43:42,740 --> 01:43:47,740
Look for prices in the late 1970s were
really high just for a lot of reasons,

1861
01:43:48,891 --> 01:43:52,790
but basically coincidentally
for fashionable and a
bunch of different places.

1862
01:43:52,910 --> 01:43:54,680
What animals are you talking about?
Oh,

1863
01:43:54,830 --> 01:43:59,830
like what would be like traditional fur
bearing animals in North America would

1864
01:44:00,501 --> 01:44:04,550
be on the, on the smaller side would
be urban and weasels and muskrats.

1865
01:44:04,910 --> 01:44:08,450
And on the bigger side would be links
in wolf and an in between that you have

1866
01:44:08,451 --> 01:44:12,170
may have things like me, wolf, raccoon,
Fox, cow. I've never tracked wolf,

1867
01:44:12,171 --> 01:44:16,610
but what I used to trap me personally,
I would trap Muskrat, mink, raccoon,

1868
01:44:16,790 --> 01:44:20,030
Fox, coyote, beaver, Otter.

1869
01:44:21,060 --> 01:44:24,170
I'd skin and sell some possums.
I'd skin cell, some skunks.

1870
01:44:25,130 --> 01:44:30,130
Now when I got into a trap and I sat in
my first trap in 1984 and you could sell

1871
01:44:30,141 --> 01:44:33,470
a Muskrat for five or $6 and I could
mow a lawn for five or six bucks.

1872
01:44:33,471 --> 01:44:35,240
So it was obviously great.

1873
01:44:36,700 --> 01:44:38,590
The from argus only went
downhill from there.

1874
01:44:38,950 --> 01:44:41,650
And by the time the mid
nineties came around,

1875
01:44:42,150 --> 01:44:42,983
mmm.

1876
01:44:44,900 --> 01:44:46,220
It was hard to make any money trapping.

1877
01:44:46,730 --> 01:44:49,760
And I realized that I would
go out and like one year,

1878
01:44:49,761 --> 01:44:52,330
I remember it was the second
last year ever trapped.

1879
01:44:52,340 --> 01:44:55,530
I remember I had the end of the year,
I had 250 muskrats,

1880
01:44:56,300 --> 01:44:58,920
52 raccoons, 13 beavers, you know,

1881
01:44:59,690 --> 01:45:03,250
and I'm looking at this big pile of
things that I went out and harvested and

1882
01:45:03,350 --> 01:45:05,240
worked my ass off to get.

1883
01:45:05,940 --> 01:45:10,310
And the value of all this
stuff wasn't set by me.

1884
01:45:10,550 --> 01:45:14,390
The value of all this stuff was set by
factors that I couldn't even begin to

1885
01:45:14,391 --> 01:45:19,160
understand the economic climate
and China, um, weather trends.

1886
01:45:19,340 --> 01:45:24,340
It would be that at the time women in
Italy would buy a fur coat that weighed as

1887
01:45:24,441 --> 01:45:28,670
much as 13 pounds. Women in Asia wouldn't
buy for fur coat the weight anymore,

1888
01:45:28,700 --> 01:45:32,960
nine pounds. So like southern
raccoons, which had a lighter hide.

1889
01:45:33,200 --> 01:45:36,950
We're bringing a lot more than northern
raccoons even though they were less good

1890
01:45:36,951 --> 01:45:41,090
quality because there's a more of a
demand and you wind up looking at all this

1891
01:45:41,091 --> 01:45:44,390
animal life,
all those wildlife and wilderness life.

1892
01:45:44,900 --> 01:45:48,320
And we're trying to like set,
you know what it's worth.

1893
01:45:49,160 --> 01:45:51,050
And I didn't have any control
over what it was worth.

1894
01:45:52,170 --> 01:45:57,170
And it felt in some ways like to when I
later discovered more like does hunting

1895
01:45:57,421 --> 01:46:01,890
for food cause I started hunting for food
or after I quit trapping for money and

1896
01:46:01,891 --> 01:46:03,930
when I hunt for food it's
like I set the value.

1897
01:46:04,740 --> 01:46:08,280
It was a non-negotiable value to me.
You know,

1898
01:46:08,760 --> 01:46:13,260
if I killed a squirrel it was a
meal, you know what I mean? It was,

1899
01:46:13,290 --> 01:46:16,110
there was that it was a meal.
There was no money involved in it.

1900
01:46:16,111 --> 01:46:18,990
Did it bother you? The idea of
killing animals as a commodity?

1901
01:46:18,991 --> 01:46:23,870
Did it feel like ethical? It didn't
feel so much unethical. Diesel good.

1902
01:46:23,930 --> 01:46:24,240
Yeah.

1903
01:46:24,240 --> 01:46:28,890
It didn't feel good because I didn't
like the idea that all these values were

1904
01:46:28,891 --> 01:46:31,660
set by other things I didn't understand.
And I also didn't like why is that?

1905
01:46:31,720 --> 01:46:32,521
If you look at,

1906
01:46:32,521 --> 01:46:36,690
let's say a trap me and I know that that
makes gonna wind up in Italy somewhere.

1907
01:46:37,080 --> 01:46:38,190
It just winds up being like,

1908
01:46:39,660 --> 01:46:43,070
it feels to me like here I am like
catching this mink and there's, and,

1909
01:46:43,080 --> 01:46:47,700
and for me to see the ultimate product
is just so diffused. It's so far away,

1910
01:46:48,070 --> 01:46:50,490
you know, it's like some in
Italy and might buy this coat,

1911
01:46:50,640 --> 01:46:54,090
I'll get $22 for the mink.
It wound up being that I just,

1912
01:46:55,350 --> 01:47:00,240
it stopped being fun for me because I
felt too much like that everything was out

1913
01:47:00,241 --> 01:47:02,250
of my control.
The business I'm in now.

1914
01:47:02,520 --> 01:47:05,190
Hold on a second before I let you go any
further, I, you're really confusing me.

1915
01:47:05,490 --> 01:47:08,310
I'm not sure I understand why you're,

1916
01:47:08,400 --> 01:47:12,350
you're fixated on this idea that you don't
control how much it's worth. You know,

1917
01:47:12,380 --> 01:47:14,970
that that's what was frustrating
about it. Um, when you,

1918
01:47:14,971 --> 01:47:17,910
when you talk about animals
and like hunting and you know,

1919
01:47:17,911 --> 01:47:21,180
this ethical hunting thing did,
did it bother you at all?

1920
01:47:21,180 --> 01:47:23,970
Do you just setting these traps and these
animals are just walking in and you're

1921
01:47:23,971 --> 01:47:28,740
just selling their furs? I Dunno,
that never bugged him in a way.

1922
01:47:28,741 --> 01:47:33,741
Like one thing that bugged me only in
retrospect because you know you skills

1923
01:47:34,321 --> 01:47:36,450
come before ethics in life.

1924
01:47:36,451 --> 01:47:40,370
Like I knew how to trap muskrats before
I learned to think about you were young.

1925
01:47:40,410 --> 01:47:42,760
How young were you when you started
in the last time trap muskrats.

1926
01:47:42,770 --> 01:47:44,060
So I didn't know.
So it was just a party.

1927
01:47:44,070 --> 01:47:47,130
You're looking back on it
now looking back on it now,

1928
01:47:47,131 --> 01:47:49,380
there's a couple things
that I did that bother me.

1929
01:47:49,650 --> 01:47:52,800
Is that about how the animals died?
No,

1930
01:47:52,830 --> 01:47:54,660
it would be that some,

1931
01:47:54,661 --> 01:47:59,661
some violate like some violations of the
law that did like where you could catch

1932
01:48:00,330 --> 01:48:04,050
otters north of a certain line.
Okay.

1933
01:48:04,500 --> 01:48:09,500
I would catch otter south of that line
and in lie about where I caught him and

1934
01:48:11,431 --> 01:48:14,070
the reason you weren't supposed to catch
himself that line is because there's a

1935
01:48:14,071 --> 01:48:18,960
reintroduction effort and daughters didn't
have a population that could support

1936
01:48:18,961 --> 01:48:23,610
it. But in this pursuit of trying
to like make money trapping,

1937
01:48:23,640 --> 01:48:28,620
I found myself doing things to make
money that were unethical. Yeah.

1938
01:48:28,700 --> 01:48:31,680
And no one was forcing me to do this.
This is things that I was doing.

1939
01:48:31,920 --> 01:48:33,720
Also in trapping,

1940
01:48:33,721 --> 01:48:37,840
you wind up generating an
enormous amount of, of, of, of,

1941
01:48:37,900 --> 01:48:41,970
of waste of flesh. When you tapping
these animals with a dying instantly,

1942
01:48:42,030 --> 01:48:46,740
most of them or how long does it take
before they die? Things are dying quickly.

1943
01:48:46,770 --> 01:48:50,280
The water species die quick.
Anything near water is good.

1944
01:48:50,300 --> 01:48:53,320
Die Quick cause you so your rig it to die.
So like if I'm setting for Moss grads,

1945
01:48:53,330 --> 01:48:54,900
they get something called
a body gripping trap.

1946
01:48:55,050 --> 01:48:58,020
The body group and trap in and of
itself is lethal in, it'll kill it.

1947
01:48:58,021 --> 01:49:00,090
A matter of minutes or less.

1948
01:49:00,750 --> 01:49:04,980
A body gripping traps set underwater
to things dead essentially. Instantly.

1949
01:49:05,490 --> 01:49:09,870
It's rounds. Yeah. I mean it was
given a mat. It'd be like if I took a,

1950
01:49:10,080 --> 01:49:15,080
if you were already underwater and
I like somehow hit you with a truck

1951
01:49:16,240 --> 01:49:19,470
underwater,
did you drown into the truck hit you?

1952
01:49:19,680 --> 01:49:23,970
So these are professional and
constructive traps. Oh yeah. Steel traps.

1953
01:49:24,190 --> 01:49:27,020
So then we, are you still cool
with those today? Is that,

1954
01:49:27,060 --> 01:49:29,250
I mean how do you feel about that today?
I've done.

1955
01:49:29,251 --> 01:49:31,590
I've done trap and as recently
as a year and a half ago,

1956
01:49:31,830 --> 01:49:34,570
trapping with beaver with body
gripping traps and snares. You,

1957
01:49:34,571 --> 01:49:37,830
but you have a problem
with feeders for deer. No,

1958
01:49:37,831 --> 01:49:39,090
I don't have a problem
with fetus for deer.

1959
01:49:39,091 --> 01:49:42,510
It doesn't appeal to me to hunt that
way, but it doesn't bother you. Trapping.

1960
01:49:42,960 --> 01:49:46,770
Trapping is a difference. I
rarely trap, but when you do,

1961
01:49:46,771 --> 01:49:50,580
it's of a pragmatic sort
of as focus. Yeah, like if,

1962
01:49:50,640 --> 01:49:54,310
if that's the best way to follow the trap
beaver now I would like for instance,

1963
01:49:54,311 --> 01:49:58,360
the beavers I've trapped most recently
I had pillows and a hat made out of the

1964
01:49:58,361 --> 01:50:02,350
hides and I ate the meat. You
ate the beaver? Yeah. Wow.

1965
01:50:02,980 --> 01:50:06,100
What the fuck is beaver tastes like? You
know? Honestly, if you, if you don't,

1966
01:50:06,130 --> 01:50:09,620
if you don't get now there, there
are herbivorous man, but yeah.

1967
01:50:11,680 --> 01:50:15,710
Gotcha. It's such, it's such low harden.

1968
01:50:15,880 --> 01:50:17,560
It's such low hanging fruit.

1969
01:50:19,330 --> 01:50:21,070
It's like one of the things,

1970
01:50:21,100 --> 01:50:23,470
like whenever the subject
of beaver trap and comes up,

1971
01:50:24,310 --> 01:50:27,490
it's such low hanging fruit to
southern vagina. Joan has to go for it.

1972
01:50:28,630 --> 01:50:32,230
Imagine now having discuss beaver
trapping for the last 20 years.

1973
01:50:32,260 --> 01:50:34,840
There's no beaver anymore, by the
way. That shit, if you find a beaver,

1974
01:50:34,841 --> 01:50:38,020
that shit's bad. That's a girl's
not shaving it, getting it grows.

1975
01:50:38,210 --> 01:50:41,110
Keep it up with the times. You
can't call that a beaver, you know,

1976
01:50:41,111 --> 01:50:44,980
you call it a hipsters go t at the most.
That's the most you'll tolerate.

1977
01:50:44,981 --> 01:50:47,690
You're not going to tolerate
a beaver or Kale. Um, so, uh,

1978
01:50:47,950 --> 01:50:51,520
on the show we were talking about this
really what you alluded to it and we said

1979
01:50:51,521 --> 01:50:55,360
we're going to get back to, we didn't,
you trapped a beaver and one of your, uh,

1980
01:50:55,420 --> 01:51:00,030
one of those living like all these other
people live. You were up in Canada. Yeah.

1981
01:51:00,350 --> 01:51:03,580
We're just body gripper traps. Is that
was, that was the same type of trend.

1982
01:51:03,581 --> 01:51:06,270
That's an instant kill
trap. And then you, uh,

1983
01:51:06,340 --> 01:51:11,080
you eat the beaver and you eat
the tail, Huh? Yeah. If you don't,

1984
01:51:11,620 --> 01:51:15,240
beaver has cast or
glands and at times the,

1985
01:51:15,400 --> 01:51:19,150
the cast or gland,
it has been more valuable than,

1986
01:51:19,160 --> 01:51:20,860
than to be retired as a caster.
Glen,

1987
01:51:20,980 --> 01:51:23,890
there's two glands that sit
on either side of their vent,

1988
01:51:23,891 --> 01:51:27,490
like basically where if your
kidneys were not against your back,

1989
01:51:27,491 --> 01:51:31,210
and they were kind of upfront, it almost
be like the same scale. It's like how,

1990
01:51:31,260 --> 01:51:32,710
how big a caster.
Glen is just a,

1991
01:51:32,980 --> 01:51:37,500
it's a pasty substance that they
secrete and it's like a calling carpets.

1992
01:51:37,510 --> 01:51:38,160
Very sweet.

1993
01:51:38,160 --> 01:51:41,200
You've never smelled anything in the
wild that smells like beaver caster and

1994
01:51:41,201 --> 01:51:45,160
people used to use it for
perfumes now that you oh yeah,
it's, it's, it's gorgeous.

1995
01:51:45,190 --> 01:51:48,640
It's a gorgeous smell.
They would add it to perfumes they had,

1996
01:51:48,641 --> 01:51:51,130
they would add it to various
pharmaceuticals in the old days.

1997
01:51:51,160 --> 01:51:55,720
Now a lot of beaver cast or goes into
making beaver Lewer because to take a

1998
01:51:55,721 --> 01:52:00,300
beaver from one pond and go to another
pond and put his caster out beavers in

1999
01:52:00,301 --> 01:52:03,610
that ponder and get pissed and they're
gonna want to kill that beaver. Really?

2000
01:52:03,730 --> 01:52:05,320
Yeah. It's like, it's a calling card.

2001
01:52:05,560 --> 01:52:08,650
So it's just a kind of a way of saying
like it's kind of way of saying fuck you

2002
01:52:08,651 --> 01:52:13,310
almost for like a beaver to go into a
new area. Like he migrates up stream,

2003
01:52:13,630 --> 01:52:15,570
he gets to a new pond,
he's going to lay down,

2004
01:52:15,580 --> 01:52:19,300
he's going to build up a little pile of
mud and secrete some his gland on there

2005
01:52:19,301 --> 01:52:22,360
and he's saying like, I'm in
town. Wow. Deal with it. I'm here.

2006
01:52:22,360 --> 01:52:26,500
So the big beaver market for castor glands
is artificially doing that to get the

2007
01:52:26,501 --> 01:52:27,550
beavers pissed off.

2008
01:52:29,200 --> 01:52:34,200
A lot of beaver caster will get sold
into making lewers for a variety of

2009
01:52:34,661 --> 01:52:39,520
species. It's beaver like skunk
essence winds up being a deterrent?

2010
01:52:39,700 --> 01:52:43,420
No, no. A lot of animals
at at small doses.

2011
01:52:43,421 --> 01:52:46,190
A lot of animals are curious
about the smell of skunk. Really.

2012
01:52:46,430 --> 01:52:49,460
If you take beaver caster and this,
it doesn't need be at low doses,

2013
01:52:49,461 --> 01:52:52,190
but beaver cast or is appealing.
So you'll trap.

2014
01:52:52,280 --> 01:52:55,630
I used to take casters from the beavers.
I caught an hour.

2015
01:52:55,631 --> 01:52:57,770
Would Adam and lure
that I'd use for coyote,

2016
01:52:57,950 --> 01:53:00,410
I'd add them in lieu or that I
used for Fox. I'd add him in the,

2017
01:53:00,470 --> 01:53:04,220
or use for raccoon addendum and all
that kind of lure in various quantities

2018
01:53:04,490 --> 01:53:05,030
because it's just,

2019
01:53:05,030 --> 01:53:08,780
it's a seductive smell that just seems
to be universally appealing. Wow.

2020
01:53:08,781 --> 01:53:12,620
And what is the or the animals attracted
because they think they're going to eat

2021
01:53:12,621 --> 01:53:16,190
the, the, the beavers glands or is
it just a smell? I think it draws,

2022
01:53:16,191 --> 01:53:20,760
I think a number of things are
going on curiosity. Um, and,

2023
01:53:20,780 --> 01:53:23,060
and perhaps it just has a,

2024
01:53:23,090 --> 01:53:28,090
like the way fish who've never
seen a worm will eat worms.

2025
01:53:28,790 --> 01:53:32,330
There's certain things that just speak
to you like on an olfactory and visual

2026
01:53:32,340 --> 01:53:33,050
sense.

2027
01:53:33,050 --> 01:53:37,550
If for some reason beaver caster
lewers in a wide variety of animals.

2028
01:53:37,580 --> 01:53:41,300
Now when you say you know, Louis for
Fox or Lewis for different animals,

2029
01:53:41,450 --> 01:53:44,510
how do you, you have, you couldn't
construct these yourself? Yeah,

2030
01:53:44,511 --> 01:53:48,420
like for instance, I used to
take a house cat meat. Okay,

2031
01:53:48,480 --> 01:53:50,770
but because you kill a cat.
No,

2032
01:53:50,780 --> 01:53:54,800
here's it's a law now you have to
promise you. You're, let me tell you,

2033
01:53:54,801 --> 01:53:58,310
let me explain everything so far. Yeah,
you have no, nothing's been too crazy.

2034
01:53:58,370 --> 01:54:02,120
Dairy farmers will keep house cats.

2035
01:54:02,180 --> 01:54:05,330
They dairy farmers like to have a lot of
cats around a control mice populations.

2036
01:54:05,450 --> 01:54:07,610
Okay.
So they want plenty of cats.

2037
01:54:08,570 --> 01:54:11,980
You get to have too many cats
because they're not, they're not the,

2038
01:54:11,990 --> 01:54:14,180
they're came catch.
These casts are essentially Farrell.

2039
01:54:14,430 --> 01:54:18,140
The hang around a farming operation.
You get too many and they start,

2040
01:54:18,141 --> 01:54:21,770
they'll transmit diseases back and forth
talking to new plasma and you wind up

2041
01:54:21,771 --> 01:54:22,604
with no cats.

2042
01:54:23,180 --> 01:54:27,980
So when a dairy farmer in my area would
get to be where he had way too many

2043
01:54:27,981 --> 01:54:32,930
cats, he would like, I used to go
out and shoot the cats on a bounty.

2044
01:54:33,320 --> 01:54:34,153
Wow.

2045
01:54:34,220 --> 01:54:37,970
So I would shoot cats for five bucks or
10 bucks or whatever because they would

2046
01:54:37,971 --> 01:54:41,150
want to trim back. They'd
be like, we got to,

2047
01:54:41,180 --> 01:54:44,210
I have to get rid of 50% of these cats
are, I'm gonna have problems. Wow.

2048
01:54:44,211 --> 01:54:49,100
So the cats are only existing on these
mice or are they giving them food as well?

2049
01:54:49,130 --> 01:54:51,920
No, the guys, they'll
definitely put feed out.

2050
01:54:51,950 --> 01:54:53,810
They'll get food out
and they role of wild.

2051
01:54:53,811 --> 01:54:57,080
And the other thing is from like,

2052
01:54:57,081 --> 01:55:01,430
if you imagine these farmyards as being
like a little nexus of, of cat stuff,

2053
01:55:01,760 --> 01:55:06,760
you'll wind up with feral cats spinning
off of that and they can have a

2054
01:55:07,910 --> 01:55:11,510
dramatically negative impact on like
ground nesting birds and things.

2055
01:55:11,900 --> 01:55:14,450
So beyond shooting cats around a farm,

2056
01:55:14,480 --> 01:55:18,960
it's common practice in
agricultural areas to kill cats.

2057
01:55:18,961 --> 01:55:23,961
That goal certifiably feral because we're
looking at them as being competition.

2058
01:55:24,111 --> 01:55:26,320
Like we want to have,
you know,

2059
01:55:26,600 --> 01:55:29,460
pheasant or grouse or to have
around and the cats like, uh,

2060
01:55:29,660 --> 01:55:33,780
a non-natural competitor. And so in the,
in the great spirit of all predators,

2061
01:55:33,800 --> 01:55:37,370
the same way a wolf will kill a coyote
and a Cowlick Hill Fox will a cat.

2062
01:55:37,520 --> 01:55:42,020
Now you're saying this very pragmatically,
but please don't. Yeah, but I used to,

2063
01:55:42,960 --> 01:55:44,280
when I was making bait,

2064
01:55:44,310 --> 01:55:47,700
I would get the cats that I would use
when I was doing control work for a dairy

2065
01:55:47,701 --> 01:55:48,534
farmer.

2066
01:55:48,870 --> 01:55:53,870
And I would take the cat and I would bone
out the back hams and I would take the

2067
01:55:53,940 --> 01:55:57,390
out the back hams mean their legs.
I would take the meat off the back legs.

2068
01:55:57,391 --> 01:56:00,000
No bones. Okay. Would up
in the morning copycat ham,

2069
01:56:00,570 --> 01:56:04,380
I would put that in a in a,
in a one quart mason jar,

2070
01:56:04,381 --> 01:56:08,730
one quart glass jar and now bury that
in the sand somewhere where it was like

2071
01:56:08,731 --> 01:56:11,040
pretty cool. So I had a controlled
temperature cause I don't want to put,

2072
01:56:11,041 --> 01:56:14,710
I couldn't put my mom's fridge so
I'd buried that coffee down the sand.

2073
01:56:14,720 --> 01:56:16,290
I'd leave it there for about
a week and it would be,

2074
01:56:16,320 --> 01:56:21,120
it would become what we would call tint
tainted. Not like taint lake, you know,

2075
01:56:21,360 --> 01:56:25,080
10 you're asking your balls, but like
it would become slightly rotted at that.

2076
01:56:25,110 --> 01:56:28,830
Once it got to be the perfect kind
of rotten, like a little bit tainted,

2077
01:56:29,340 --> 01:56:33,470
I would add glycerin to it,
like a preservative to halt the rock.

2078
01:56:34,020 --> 01:56:37,710
Then I would add in small amounts of
other stuff like output, put pulverized.

2079
01:56:37,740 --> 01:56:42,740
I would take beaver caster and mince it
up in a mortar and pestle and add some

2080
01:56:43,041 --> 01:56:47,040
beaver caster into it. I might add
a little bit of fish oil into it.

2081
01:56:47,280 --> 01:56:50,790
I might add like glands
from a Red Fox into it.

2082
01:56:51,560 --> 01:56:55,380
Is this is all common
trappers are, no, no, no.

2083
01:56:55,381 --> 01:56:59,190
There's not all travelers, but some
trappers, there's recipes for this.

2084
01:56:59,220 --> 01:57:04,220
Do they sell this stuff like a Nordic
versions or type in type in trapping

2085
01:57:05,161 --> 01:57:09,780
louvers on your deal there. My head sets
wigging out. Yeah, mine is too Brian.

2086
01:57:09,780 --> 01:57:12,780
This thing keeps fucking up.
The sound on this thing is a mess.

2087
01:57:12,930 --> 01:57:16,200
That's why I keep grabbing it. You're
your connections off somehow or another.

2088
01:57:17,220 --> 01:57:21,150
So an ounce, a trapping Lou are usually
sells for five or six bucks for an ounce,

2089
01:57:21,870 --> 01:57:23,520
seven 50 maybe for an ounce.

2090
01:57:23,860 --> 01:57:28,860
And so I would make my lures this way
and I would then use these lures to lure

2091
01:57:28,981 --> 01:57:32,640
and animals in, in, you know, to
lure and Fox and stuff. Other stuff.

2092
01:57:32,641 --> 01:57:34,470
I would just use a piece of
stuff like all summer out.

2093
01:57:34,500 --> 01:57:35,940
If I was flying fish to eat,

2094
01:57:35,960 --> 01:57:38,970
I would just save the heads and use
the heads for mink. Just that simple,

2095
01:57:38,971 --> 01:57:42,000
just a piece of a fish head. All those
stuff. You have to be more complicated.

2096
01:57:42,810 --> 01:57:45,790
Like a Fox is probably his giant
not going to be hungry enough.

2097
01:57:45,820 --> 01:57:47,790
He's not just going to come
in for a piece of rotten meat.

2098
01:57:47,970 --> 01:57:52,420
There's gotta be something. It's like
says to him like what, what in the world?

2099
01:57:52,740 --> 01:57:55,550
What in the world could that be now?
What do you say to, I mean you're,

2100
01:57:55,551 --> 01:57:57,570
you're saying this all very pragmatic.

2101
01:57:57,571 --> 01:58:00,840
Obviously you grew up this
way and this is, you know,

2102
01:58:01,050 --> 01:58:05,010
just part of life and it makes sense
to me. I have no arguments with it,

2103
01:58:05,011 --> 01:58:07,890
but a lot of people would
submit for shooting cats.

2104
01:58:08,280 --> 01:58:09,510
A lot of people would be like,
you know,

2105
01:58:09,511 --> 01:58:12,570
you fucking piece of shit
out there shooting cats.

2106
01:58:12,900 --> 01:58:15,900
Like that's a weird
conversation to it is man.

2107
01:58:15,901 --> 01:58:18,990
And I know and the only way to treat
it like don't think for a second that I

2108
01:58:18,991 --> 01:58:21,800
don't recognize that that's
like something that would,

2109
01:58:21,801 --> 01:58:23,910
would potentially curl someone's hair.
You know,

2110
01:58:23,920 --> 01:58:24,960
it's going to get their attention.

2111
01:58:25,320 --> 01:58:30,320
But there's no other real way for me to
discuss it because at the time that it

2112
01:58:30,511 --> 01:58:35,340
was occurring, it was just a
matter of fact thing that happened.

2113
01:58:35,540 --> 01:58:38,970
And still now if I would never,
like we bring, I don't know,

2114
01:58:38,971 --> 01:58:40,650
I can't remember how many million,
37 million.

2115
01:58:40,651 --> 01:58:45,651
I don't know how million cats get
euthanized in humane society facilities in

2116
01:58:46,421 --> 01:58:51,190
various facilities around the country
year in another. We're fine with that.

2117
01:58:51,340 --> 01:58:52,820
Yeah, it's in the millions. So your,

2118
01:58:52,970 --> 01:58:57,970
so if you have a dairy farmer and he
just gets to a point where he has cats as

2119
01:58:58,601 --> 01:59:00,520
part of his business and is part of it,

2120
01:59:00,521 --> 01:59:04,870
you just enjoys them around and he gets
to a point where he has to get rid of

2121
01:59:04,871 --> 01:59:06,760
some that there's sickness
spreading among them.

2122
01:59:07,030 --> 01:59:11,710
I just don't really know that he's being
that absurd or that unethical did he

2123
01:59:11,711 --> 01:59:15,040
has someone come out and put
them down with a firearm?

2124
01:59:15,940 --> 01:59:18,300
I mean it's like as much
as I recognize that,

2125
01:59:18,340 --> 01:59:20,860
that it's so far removed from what
most people are familiar with.

2126
01:59:20,860 --> 01:59:22,300
It was just something that happened.

2127
01:59:22,301 --> 01:59:25,960
It was something I did and it's not
something that I in any way feel like I

2128
01:59:25,961 --> 01:59:28,330
should apologize for
because looking back on it,

2129
01:59:28,480 --> 01:59:30,750
it's probably still going on right now.
There's probably,

2130
01:59:31,540 --> 01:59:33,760
there's like a guy who can't have
that many cats running around.

2131
01:59:33,761 --> 01:59:37,240
Well not only that, I mean cats, cats
do transmit a lot of fucking diseases,

2132
01:59:37,241 --> 01:59:38,500
especially feral cats,

2133
01:59:38,800 --> 01:59:43,330
feral cats or that can be dangerous to
your actual humans and especially babies,

2134
01:59:43,570 --> 01:59:45,250
you know the cat diseases.

2135
01:59:45,251 --> 01:59:48,400
Like that's the reason why they tell
women not to fuck with litter when you're

2136
01:59:48,401 --> 01:59:49,234
pregnant again.

2137
01:59:49,760 --> 01:59:52,930
And also like my kid has a sandbox and
we got it covered up to keep cats of it.

2138
01:59:53,260 --> 01:59:58,090
So you know, I get all that.
And Dirty Brooklyn cats.

2139
01:59:58,210 --> 01:59:59,150
It's just something,
yeah,

2140
01:59:59,160 --> 02:00:00,720
it's just something I know
you can imagine what they are.

2141
02:00:00,720 --> 02:00:04,320
All Brooklyn cats must be fucking
terrifying. So the other thing is,

2142
02:00:04,321 --> 02:00:06,880
is still like if I was out now,
like

2143
02:00:08,620 --> 02:00:09,341
if I'm out now,

2144
02:00:09,341 --> 02:00:14,341
I don't have happy feelings toward a feral
cat who's out living as a Predator on

2145
02:00:16,001 --> 02:00:16,451
the area.

2146
02:00:16,451 --> 02:00:19,990
I don't feel that way about a feral cat
that I would feel about a native Redd

2147
02:00:19,991 --> 02:00:21,580
Foxx.
I see her date of Redd Foxx.

2148
02:00:21,581 --> 02:00:25,080
I feel blessed to have seen it because
I'm seeing some like cool animals. Yeah.

2149
02:00:25,090 --> 02:00:28,180
Like some part of a living landscape.
You know,

2150
02:00:28,370 --> 02:00:31,870
if I see a cat I'm like oh there's some
thing that we sort of through our own

2151
02:00:31,871 --> 02:00:36,871
stupidity have just yet one more thing
that we've thrust upon their assholes

2152
02:00:37,900 --> 02:00:40,720
thrust upon the environment.
Cause cause you can't snuggle them.

2153
02:00:40,721 --> 02:00:44,240
You can't call him, you can't go and pet
up feral cat, they don't protect you up.

2154
02:00:44,410 --> 02:00:47,130
They don't pursue it a little, scratch
it. So no, I don't have a lot of things.

2155
02:00:47,131 --> 02:00:50,770
But yeah of course it's a outlandish
thing and I'll sometimes do outlandish

2156
02:00:50,771 --> 02:00:54,250
things and half of the reason we were
to another that we talked the night,

2157
02:00:54,251 --> 02:00:57,970
it's like I went to Vietnam
and did a magazine story about,

2158
02:00:58,230 --> 02:01:02,480
about eating dog meat, you know, and I
eat dog meet seven nights in a row. Whoa.

2159
02:01:02,680 --> 02:01:03,850
Largely yes.

2160
02:01:04,150 --> 02:01:08,380
When I went there honestly I was curious
about why do people eat dog meat at the

2161
02:01:08,380 --> 02:01:08,660
end of the lunar year?

2162
02:01:08,660 --> 02:01:12,050
It's like considered a lucky
food and auspicious food
and it's cultural. Nothing,

2163
02:01:12,400 --> 02:01:15,640
not so fucking lucky. And I will say
they might want to try to do trinkets.

2164
02:01:16,030 --> 02:01:20,800
So dog, but party wanted to go there just
because I knew that it would like that.

2165
02:01:20,801 --> 02:01:25,730
It would like raise people's hackles,
raised my raise, my hackles. I didn't,

2166
02:01:25,870 --> 02:01:28,750
I didn't enjoy it. But have your tastes
do things. I couldn't tell you man.

2167
02:01:28,751 --> 02:01:29,730
I never enjoyed a bite of it.

2168
02:01:29,790 --> 02:01:32,320
I it seven nights in row and I
could never get over the moral.

2169
02:01:32,590 --> 02:01:36,820
I couldn't ever get over the it and then
I wished that I was man enough or like,

2170
02:01:37,240 --> 02:01:40,460
like collected mentally enough
to get over it and just enjoy it.

2171
02:01:40,461 --> 02:01:41,720
But I could never get beyond.

2172
02:01:42,670 --> 02:01:46,660
So you were sick every time he
ate my wife, my wife's with me,

2173
02:01:46,690 --> 02:01:49,980
she came out to cheat it. Oh yeah.
She never liked it. My brother Dan,

2174
02:01:49,981 --> 02:01:52,990
he was with me. He never liked it.
Wow. None of us could get past it.

2175
02:01:52,991 --> 02:01:57,460
Dogs are too cool, man. There's a deal
that they've made. But then again,

2176
02:01:57,461 --> 02:02:00,330
feral dogs, man, there was a
problem in Georgia recently. A,

2177
02:02:00,331 --> 02:02:03,850
an elderly couple was attacked and
killed by feral dogs. Really? Yeah.

2178
02:02:03,851 --> 02:02:04,331
They're getting,

2179
02:02:04,331 --> 02:02:08,290
they're getting problems in places where
you have large populations of feral

2180
02:02:08,291 --> 02:02:12,670
dogs. And get together as packs, you
know, meeting people killed by dogs. Man.

2181
02:02:12,700 --> 02:02:16,330
It's not, it's not a, if
it grows wild out there,

2182
02:02:16,360 --> 02:02:21,000
it's a wild animal. I mean it's that
quick. It makes the jump. Yeah, fair.

2183
02:02:21,040 --> 02:02:22,810
Like the whole,
the whole feral issue too,

2184
02:02:22,811 --> 02:02:27,811
like fascinating feral pigs and
they change the morph as feral pigs,

2185
02:02:28,061 --> 02:02:29,890
things playing that cause a
lot of people don't even know.

2186
02:02:30,530 --> 02:02:34,010
Point feral pigs are
probably might be recognized.

2187
02:02:34,011 --> 02:02:37,400
I mean in some places they are recognized
as they're like here now. But no,

2188
02:02:37,401 --> 02:02:42,401
I mean we have feral two types of feral
pigs historically that came in the US.

2189
02:02:42,681 --> 02:02:46,390
Do you have farm pigs that
people brought here? You know,

2190
02:02:46,550 --> 02:02:48,950
just the very early stages
of our national development.

2191
02:02:49,130 --> 02:02:54,130
People bring like agricultural breeds of
pigs and rather than feeding them you'd

2192
02:02:54,231 --> 02:02:57,500
kind of let them wander around and he'd
go out and forage and eat acorns one not.

2193
02:02:57,501 --> 02:03:00,290
And when you want him to go shoot them
and inevitably there's a certain amount

2194
02:03:00,291 --> 02:03:00,771
of loss.

2195
02:03:00,771 --> 02:03:04,610
Like some of them don't come back and
they go off into the hinterlands and make

2196
02:03:04,611 --> 02:03:05,444
their own way.

2197
02:03:06,080 --> 02:03:09,710
So then that's like a d escaped
domestic like on this feral.

2198
02:03:10,710 --> 02:03:14,300
Another thing we have here in the u s in
some places where people actually took

2199
02:03:14,301 --> 02:03:19,100
the, like all like pigs historically
are descendants of Eurasian wild boar.

2200
02:03:19,460 --> 02:03:24,460
So domestic breeds were
spun off of this species of,

2201
02:03:25,340 --> 02:03:28,970
of, of forest forest dwelling
pig lives in Europe and Asia.

2202
02:03:29,300 --> 02:03:32,420
The same way like candle came from
the oryx but the oryx went extinct.

2203
02:03:32,780 --> 02:03:34,820
Pigs came from the erasion
wild boar with the erasion.

2204
02:03:34,821 --> 02:03:37,310
Wild boar never went extinct.
They still exist.

2205
02:03:37,640 --> 02:03:41,660
People will now and then get their hands
on your Asian wild boars and think this

2206
02:03:41,661 --> 02:03:44,960
would be sweet if it lived in the woods
by my house and they'll take them here

2207
02:03:44,961 --> 02:03:48,320
and let them go. So you're taking like a
wild animal and turning it loose. Wild.

2208
02:03:48,380 --> 02:03:52,870
This is illegal now, but it, it went
on and in a lot of places, you know,

2209
02:03:52,880 --> 02:03:56,900
in some places you'll have where it's
like, that's how you get Hogzilla. No,

2210
02:03:56,901 --> 02:04:01,700
you get Hogzilla by taking a pig and put
into Penn and fattening it up till it's

2211
02:04:01,701 --> 02:04:02,534
really huge.

2212
02:04:02,660 --> 02:04:05,600
And then letting it go and shooting it
and calling the newspaper and saying,

2213
02:04:05,601 --> 02:04:09,050
you just shot in 1100 pound wild pig.
Really? That's all those, listen,

2214
02:04:09,500 --> 02:04:11,750
those guys that killed was
1100 pound pigs. Like one guy,

2215
02:04:11,751 --> 02:04:15,320
I remember it came up and he killed one
and a couple days later a guy came out

2216
02:04:15,380 --> 02:04:17,120
and said, I just sold that guy, that pig.

2217
02:04:17,840 --> 02:04:22,410
Whoa. But I thought that Hog Zillow has
been proven to be half a bore. It's um,

2218
02:04:22,420 --> 02:04:25,100
yeah, it's your, it's right
here. It's a male hybrid.

2219
02:04:25,340 --> 02:04:29,120
It's a hybrid of a wild hog and domestic
pig that was shot and killed and

2220
02:04:29,121 --> 02:04:32,300
Atlanta, Georgia or
excuse me, I'll lap Aha.

2221
02:04:32,450 --> 02:04:36,730
Georgia on June 17 2004 it
mean, I mean it was, but it,

2222
02:04:36,980 --> 02:04:38,130
it had been feeding on

2223
02:04:38,130 --> 02:04:41,400
green, but it's a, it's a
hybrid. It's half wild boar.

2224
02:04:42,950 --> 02:04:46,920
But here, so this guy I
need to know you need, yeah,

2225
02:04:47,190 --> 02:04:50,440
there was lying going on but it
has like the giant tusks and shit.

2226
02:04:50,520 --> 02:04:52,490
We need to allow me to
finish what I'm saying. Okay.

2227
02:04:53,280 --> 02:04:57,970
In some places you still have remnants
of actual Eurasia and wild pigs in the u

2228
02:04:57,971 --> 02:04:58,570
s right.

2229
02:04:58,570 --> 02:05:01,380
In some places you have some area where
all the pigs are like a farm breed,

2230
02:05:01,590 --> 02:05:06,060
but usually in any place
that would support one would
support other and has had

2231
02:05:06,061 --> 02:05:09,080
chances to support the other.
And so you have like hybrid populations,

2232
02:05:09,081 --> 02:05:13,740
so where eye on them. In
northern California they
tend to be black, big toss.

2233
02:05:13,770 --> 02:05:16,890
Why are you here? They tend to look
like a razorback your rage and pig,

2234
02:05:17,310 --> 02:05:19,560
but at the same time all of a sudden
you look in, one will be modeled,

2235
02:05:20,160 --> 02:05:24,450
he'll have like a white patch on his rump
and so you know there's some exchange

2236
02:05:24,451 --> 02:05:27,930
going on between what you know that when
you take a domestic pig and you said it

2237
02:05:27,931 --> 02:05:32,090
pharaoh, within three weeks they start to
change. They metamorphosized they there.

2238
02:05:32,091 --> 02:05:35,790
They're there for gets thicker and darker.
Their tusks grow.

2239
02:05:35,830 --> 02:05:38,580
There are the only animal that we've ever
observed that you let it loose in the

2240
02:05:38,581 --> 02:05:42,030
wild and it's does physical body
changes growing woolly? Yeah.

2241
02:05:42,031 --> 02:05:43,980
Were you aware of this?
They're nose is stretch out.

2242
02:05:44,010 --> 02:05:45,960
They literally become more work or wow.

2243
02:05:46,020 --> 02:05:50,910
I've heard they have like they'll go
through morphological changes once they,

2244
02:05:50,940 --> 02:05:54,540
once they changed their habits and I
guess that you might look at a person and

2245
02:05:54,541 --> 02:05:58,520
say the same thing that I liked this man.
Look at that motherfucker.

2246
02:06:00,210 --> 02:06:04,080
I mean come on dude, that was, that
was in someone's yard. I don't want to,

2247
02:06:04,081 --> 02:06:06,690
I don't want to get into, I don't
want to get into specifics with you,

2248
02:06:06,840 --> 02:06:10,140
but if you do a small amount
of research on this subject,

2249
02:06:10,380 --> 02:06:13,710
you're going to find that there
is a lot of fuckery. Yeah,

2250
02:06:13,740 --> 02:06:17,100
there's a lot of bullshit or oh,
I was around in the hog Zillow thing.

2251
02:06:17,101 --> 02:06:22,101
Namely that pigs that are being presented
to the press as being wild pigs in

2252
02:06:25,021 --> 02:06:29,370
fact have a history of
being fed artificially.

2253
02:06:29,490 --> 02:06:30,600
Brion pull up that picture.

2254
02:06:30,870 --> 02:06:33,570
Well that shit up and put it on Twitter
because that is the most ridiculous shit

2255
02:06:33,571 --> 02:06:37,020
in my life right there.
Why don't you just put it up on Youtube?

2256
02:06:37,021 --> 02:06:40,470
Look at the size of that God damn thing.
Look at that. That's a monster, man.

2257
02:06:40,480 --> 02:06:44,090
There's also, there's also a photography
trick called force perspective course.

2258
02:06:44,110 --> 02:06:48,180
The guys behind the ducting. I get
that, but Jesus Christ, that's a,

2259
02:06:48,181 --> 02:06:50,910
that's a crazy looking fucking
unjust to werewolf pig. Listen,

2260
02:06:50,940 --> 02:06:54,140
I'm not angling this not a huge pig.
I'm just saying that you have to fleas.

2261
02:06:54,480 --> 02:06:56,460
I do lists. I believe you, man. You're so,

2262
02:06:56,461 --> 02:06:59,430
you're saying that the only way you get
a pig like this as if you grow it in

2263
02:06:59,431 --> 02:07:03,480
captivity, do they grow hybrids in
captivity? Is that as well? They do that.

2264
02:07:03,481 --> 02:07:06,090
They grow up.
I know a guy that has pigs,

2265
02:07:06,120 --> 02:07:09,420
he has hybrid pigs and he sells
in the market, so he grows up.

2266
02:07:09,440 --> 02:07:11,130
There's no looks like nothing against it.

2267
02:07:11,250 --> 02:07:13,890
They look like this and he gets them
all giant and then he shoots him and he

2268
02:07:13,891 --> 02:07:16,600
left. He does calls the news
like that. I think that,

2269
02:07:16,680 --> 02:07:19,860
I think that what you're looking
at is when someone presents,

2270
02:07:19,890 --> 02:07:22,380
like let's say you raise up a pig
that gets to a thousand pounds,

2271
02:07:22,950 --> 02:07:27,360
that's a feat in and of itself.
It's a giant pig to sweeten the deal,

2272
02:07:27,700 --> 02:07:30,750
one to act like you also shot it hunting.
Who by the way,

2273
02:07:30,751 --> 02:07:33,810
that photo that we just said I should
correct myself right now that is actually

2274
02:07:33,811 --> 02:07:36,070
a wild boar that the guy shot

2275
02:07:36,070 --> 02:07:39,640
in Europe, so it is a wild boar.
It's nothing to do with America.

2276
02:07:39,670 --> 02:07:44,020
That one animal that we were just looking
at because I just googled Hogzilla and

2277
02:07:44,021 --> 02:07:47,210
that pulled up, which looks very
different than this Hogzilla,

2278
02:07:47,500 --> 02:07:48,850
which is actually a very good point.

2279
02:07:49,150 --> 02:07:52,350
If you see this is the Hogzilla
that was the famous one that uh,

2280
02:07:52,351 --> 02:07:56,500
a lot of people were saying. We're very
different looking at him and hanging out.

2281
02:07:56,770 --> 02:08:00,280
I think that's the one that had been
hanging out eating corn as some kind of

2282
02:08:00,281 --> 02:08:03,370
fattening facility,
very different looking animal.

2283
02:08:03,430 --> 02:08:04,810
Then the thing that we just saw,

2284
02:08:04,811 --> 02:08:07,840
which was really a wild
monster fucking Werewolf,

2285
02:08:07,841 --> 02:08:09,100
it looks like a Goddamn Werewolf.

2286
02:08:09,600 --> 02:08:12,060
They get bit. How did we even
get out of the subjective, like a

2287
02:08:13,270 --> 02:08:16,000
what? Feral pigs? Feral
animals. Feral cats.

2288
02:08:16,001 --> 02:08:19,840
We were talking about that they had a
feral cat for a pet. Once they're there.

2289
02:08:19,841 --> 02:08:21,520
Wild Man. They're not
like a writer. You mean?

2290
02:08:21,521 --> 02:08:23,140
You can't even think
of it as a regular cat.

2291
02:08:23,200 --> 02:08:25,750
You might just have while have a
fucking sewer rat as your friend,

2292
02:08:26,110 --> 02:08:28,630
you know they're feral cats or cranes.
They never get it out of their head.

2293
02:08:28,631 --> 02:08:30,100
We had a,
we had a cat named fig.

2294
02:08:30,101 --> 02:08:33,400
The cat that we found in the wet will be
kind of tamed it by putting fish heads

2295
02:08:33,401 --> 02:08:37,300
out for it and eventually kind attained
it, but you never really own that.

2296
02:08:37,360 --> 02:08:40,810
I had one named Jack Dempsey.
He couldn't pick this one of fucker up.

2297
02:08:40,811 --> 02:08:43,990
He would fucking go crazy and call your
face off, but you could go up to him,

2298
02:08:43,991 --> 02:08:47,200
sneak up on them and prep them a little
bit. Who let you pet them? A little bit.

2299
02:08:47,201 --> 02:08:49,360
Only me. It was only one
person that could pet them.

2300
02:08:49,580 --> 02:08:53,640
The early about this cat food. The cat
is, he would go away on long trips. Oh,

2301
02:08:53,670 --> 02:08:58,250
come back. A week later he come right
down to step two feral cats, man.

2302
02:08:58,251 --> 02:08:59,320
Like do crazy shit

2303
02:09:00,030 --> 02:09:03,240
steps that led from the
road down these long,

2304
02:09:03,241 --> 02:09:06,380
like kind of like long terrorists steps
down to our house by the lake and some

2305
02:09:06,381 --> 02:09:08,340
of it when he came home he'd
come right down to steps. Man,

2306
02:09:08,341 --> 02:09:11,990
he would walk into grass. He's like he
wanting to announce his return and then

2307
02:09:12,190 --> 02:09:14,720
relax and you'd get geared
up for his next trip.

2308
02:09:14,810 --> 02:09:18,650
I've read about a feral cat that
traveled some insane amount of distance,

2309
02:09:18,651 --> 02:09:21,630
like a thousand miles to reunite
with his family. Once they moved,

2310
02:09:22,120 --> 02:09:26,660
they move at Jay showed up. Now it
sounds like it would be, but no,

2311
02:09:26,661 --> 02:09:30,950
I'm pretty sure it really happened. I'm
pretty sure Google that shit. Oh No.

2312
02:09:30,980 --> 02:09:33,080
I want it. Here's what I was
going to get at with feral stuff,

2313
02:09:33,380 --> 02:09:33,861
and this is a,

2314
02:09:33,861 --> 02:09:38,300
this is a interesting thing is like you
look at in the Hawaiian Hawaiian islands

2315
02:09:38,540 --> 02:09:41,330
where you have humans,

2316
02:09:41,750 --> 02:09:45,020
like the Polynesians arrived in
Hawaiian that maybe 1100 years ago.

2317
02:09:45,140 --> 02:09:47,330
Until then there had been no
one on those islands. Right.

2318
02:09:47,930 --> 02:09:51,170
And they brought with
them pigs. Yeah. Okay.

2319
02:09:51,920 --> 02:09:56,240
At this point now we all accept that
that's like the native indigenous

2320
02:09:56,241 --> 02:09:58,970
population of humans.
We call them Hawaiians,

2321
02:09:59,600 --> 02:10:03,740
but places like the Nature Conservancy
will get their hands on land there and

2322
02:10:03,741 --> 02:10:08,150
they want an extra pate.
The non native wild pigs,

2323
02:10:09,320 --> 02:10:13,160
even though the two things
arrived together, one's native in,

2324
02:10:13,161 --> 02:10:18,161
one's a nonnative nuisance and it
really draws into question our ideas of,

2325
02:10:18,980 --> 02:10:22,730
especially now where so much everything
we eat essentially is large and imported.

2326
02:10:22,850 --> 02:10:26,360
I mean important like the seeds are
developed and other continents and we have

2327
02:10:26,361 --> 02:10:28,670
made a real melting pot of,

2328
02:10:28,730 --> 02:10:33,620
of what's indigenous in endemic
to here and what we've all in.

2329
02:10:33,860 --> 02:10:33,980
And

2330
02:10:33,980 --> 02:10:37,070
so my perspective on, oh there's
a cat, he don't belong here. Bang.

2331
02:10:37,670 --> 02:10:40,400
The fact that that camp might be
standing out in a wheat field,

2332
02:10:40,430 --> 02:10:45,110
which is non native plant. I don't
then look at it and go like, oh,

2333
02:10:45,111 --> 02:10:46,790
the whole world's cockeyed.

2334
02:10:46,791 --> 02:10:49,610
I'm just like very selective in what
I think should be introduced and what

2335
02:10:49,611 --> 02:10:51,050
shouldn't be introduced.
You know

2336
02:10:52,420 --> 02:10:54,540
you're engrossed in your
Hogzilla sir. No, no.

2337
02:10:54,541 --> 02:10:55,860
I'm listening to you totally as well.

2338
02:10:56,340 --> 02:11:00,920
I'm just listening to find out if I'm
full of shit about cats traveling to the

2339
02:11:00,921 --> 02:11:05,310
new houses. Apparently they can't do it.
Thousand Miles can find people know it's,

2340
02:11:05,340 --> 02:11:09,870
you know, there's a bunch
of, unfortunately a lot of
its urban myth, but how long,

2341
02:11:09,871 --> 02:11:14,730
but they are saying that it is a really
kind of shock. Shocking how, wow.

2342
02:11:14,970 --> 02:11:16,980
How far they can travel and find people.

2343
02:11:16,981 --> 02:11:20,280
And there's a bizarre theory about it by
this guy named Doctor Rupert Sheldrake.

2344
02:11:20,550 --> 02:11:25,550
It's about morphic fields and it's
actually a very hotly contested,

2345
02:11:25,741 --> 02:11:27,150
but in,
in his eyes,

2346
02:11:27,420 --> 02:11:30,420
provable that animals know when
their parents are coming home,

2347
02:11:30,421 --> 02:11:33,240
they know when their owners are coming
home and that they can sense it.

2348
02:11:33,241 --> 02:11:35,070
Even if it's a random time during the day.

2349
02:11:35,071 --> 02:11:38,070
There's very specific things that
the dogs do like go towards the door,

2350
02:11:38,160 --> 02:11:40,680
the door when they could have no idea
that the person was anywhere near them.

2351
02:11:40,750 --> 02:11:42,430
Yeah,
I actually see it all the time.

2352
02:11:42,431 --> 02:11:47,431
I cause I have security systems and like
I can watch the recording video maybe

2353
02:11:47,950 --> 02:11:52,950
five minutes before I get home that dog
or in cats would just suddenly kind of

2354
02:11:53,051 --> 02:11:54,830
wake up and kind of like just look out,

2355
02:11:55,030 --> 02:11:58,810
like look towards the window and
it's like not even like 40 minutes.

2356
02:11:58,960 --> 02:12:01,600
Sheldrake's idea about it is that there's,

2357
02:12:01,840 --> 02:12:04,870
there's some other sense that
we don't particularly have.

2358
02:12:04,900 --> 02:12:07,780
There's something that we don't use.
We don't need it so we don't detect it.

2359
02:12:08,080 --> 02:12:08,651
And there's a,

2360
02:12:08,651 --> 02:12:12,550
there's a field of energy that somehow
or another we can detect certain things

2361
02:12:12,551 --> 02:12:14,170
with and we're just not in tune with it.

2362
02:12:14,171 --> 02:12:19,171
And one of the best ways of proving this
is the one psychic thing that seems to

2363
02:12:19,331 --> 02:12:23,380
be measurable and that is that people
know when people are looking at them and

2364
02:12:23,381 --> 02:12:23,860
that's a,

2365
02:12:23,860 --> 02:12:28,300
Oh actually I got to show
that statistically measurable
that people can tell

2366
02:12:28,450 --> 02:12:32,230
when people are looking at them. And the
idea behind this is there's some, some,

2367
02:12:32,590 --> 02:12:35,680
some energy that's going out and
something that people were tuning in.

2368
02:12:35,681 --> 02:12:40,030
But you know, we, we poo
poo it because it's not a
commonplace idea, but what it's,

2369
02:12:40,031 --> 02:12:41,830
you know,
smell crazy as hell.

2370
02:12:41,980 --> 02:12:45,100
The idea that there's something that
you can't see and it comes from us,

2371
02:12:45,130 --> 02:12:47,060
a cheeseburger and it goes
up your nostrils and it's,

2372
02:12:47,061 --> 02:12:50,890
he's Adams and let you know it's delicious
or that it smells like shit and you

2373
02:12:50,891 --> 02:12:54,400
should leave it alone and run from it. I
mean, just try describing what that is,

2374
02:12:54,401 --> 02:12:57,460
you know, I mean, it's not like arrogant
enough to be able to say like, oh no,

2375
02:12:57,461 --> 02:12:58,630
the world stops right here.

2376
02:12:58,870 --> 02:13:03,820
Like whatever I'm privy to is the end
and nothing else can be privy to anything

2377
02:13:03,821 --> 02:13:06,760
extra than what I am. I mean, this is kind
of a ridiculous notion. Like it's hard.

2378
02:13:06,761 --> 02:13:09,490
It's impossible to say what kind
of trip animals around animals.

2379
02:13:10,210 --> 02:13:15,010
You see animals do inexplicably things
and I don't then wind up turning to like

2380
02:13:15,070 --> 02:13:20,070
mysticism or like spiritual isn't to
explain it when it might just be that they

2381
02:13:20,771 --> 02:13:21,790
have sensory there.

2382
02:13:21,800 --> 02:13:25,300
They have like sensory perceptions that
are picking up on things that allude me.

2383
02:13:25,330 --> 02:13:28,820
But you spent a lot of time
in Alaska. Um, have you uh,

2384
02:13:29,230 --> 02:13:31,800
ever heard a legitimate foot story?

2385
02:13:32,460 --> 02:13:34,260
You ever heard some that
make you really think

2386
02:13:37,190 --> 02:13:38,630
a really weird thing to talk about it?
No,

2387
02:13:38,631 --> 02:13:40,850
it's not what we're doing to talk about
and not, not taking a dead, not serious.

2388
02:13:40,880 --> 02:13:44,360
Okay. No, no. There was no rushing.

2389
02:13:44,361 --> 02:13:47,840
I does it.
Here's the one of the,

2390
02:13:47,900 --> 02:13:51,050
I mean there's a million reasons
why I don't know, a million.

2391
02:13:51,051 --> 02:13:53,420
It was a handful of reasons why I'm,

2392
02:13:53,430 --> 02:13:57,230
I'm very suspicious of big for stories
and don't believe in big foot and primary.

2393
02:13:57,440 --> 02:14:02,050
I think about like this if even if
you have a very small population,

2394
02:14:02,051 --> 02:14:03,580
things like think of the Florida panthers,

2395
02:14:03,820 --> 02:14:07,480
there's a subspecies of the
mountain liner. Peugeot,
500 of them live in Florida,

2396
02:14:07,481 --> 02:14:09,460
right? Yeah. Yeah. Every year.

2397
02:14:09,510 --> 02:14:13,300
The edit time they were down in the last
50 or 500 no, there's about 50 yeah.

2398
02:14:14,080 --> 02:14:17,920
Yeah. I got hit by, it was a five.
You get hit by cars. Fuck them.

2399
02:14:18,430 --> 02:14:22,020
No what I'm saying or not. Again,
you have so few and you got,

2400
02:14:22,030 --> 02:14:24,370
they'll get hit by a car,
they'll turn up in a guy's yard.

2401
02:14:24,520 --> 02:14:26,230
It's like you can't hide them.
Right.

2402
02:14:26,260 --> 02:14:29,650
And then you're telling me that we've
had over all these hundreds of years,

2403
02:14:30,370 --> 02:14:34,880
no Harry and the Hendersons
moment where a got that we,

2404
02:14:35,170 --> 02:14:38,110
there's just not like a dead
one floats up on the beach.

2405
02:14:38,830 --> 02:14:41,020
A guy runs one over with a car.

2406
02:14:41,350 --> 02:14:44,270
It's like you really can't hide animals.
You knew that.

2407
02:14:44,280 --> 02:14:46,870
You take like a handful of wolves
and reintroduce them somewhere like

2408
02:14:46,871 --> 02:14:49,030
Yellowstone national park,
the greater Yellowstone ecosystem,

2409
02:14:49,930 --> 02:14:52,390
one of the wildest
sections of our country.

2410
02:14:53,230 --> 02:14:54,730
You turn a handful of wolves in there.

2411
02:14:54,910 --> 02:14:59,560
It's not two days later and you know
you got one shot, one, some guy ran,

2412
02:14:59,561 --> 02:15:00,394
went over.

2413
02:15:00,460 --> 02:15:03,130
It's like things just kind of come out
of the woodwork and I don't think that we

2414
02:15:03,131 --> 02:15:05,710
could have been hiding this giant primate

2415
02:15:07,730 --> 02:15:10,520
out there without someone
hitting it with a car,

2416
02:15:10,820 --> 02:15:13,970
without having just like you and I know
that the older they got like a top of

2417
02:15:13,971 --> 02:15:17,800
one's head here and to track
there and the Yeti. Yeah.

2418
02:15:17,801 --> 02:15:21,740
It never got an actual physical specimen
of a big foot, you know, Mitch Hedberg,

2419
02:15:21,860 --> 02:15:25,630
uh, he fell as though pictures
of big foot weren't blurs,

2420
02:15:25,640 --> 02:15:29,770
just a big foot was blurred. Yeah, that
was a great job. I remember that. Um,

2421
02:15:29,940 --> 02:15:33,890
less drought had a great big foot story,
you know, survivor man, it's fucking,

2422
02:15:34,160 --> 02:15:38,120
you know, it w he was talking about
being up in Alaska completely by himself,

2423
02:15:38,121 --> 02:15:40,400
hundreds of miles from anything.
And he heard,

2424
02:15:41,900 --> 02:15:46,240
he heard like some crazy primates
sound and something small branches.

2425
02:15:46,470 --> 02:15:48,830
Well he was alone in the
dark, you know, in Alaska.

2426
02:15:49,130 --> 02:15:52,690
But the whole Alaska big foot things
brand new. No, it's not now. There's bad.

2427
02:15:52,690 --> 02:15:57,590
It is. There's been a lot of like BC,
Alaska stuff like British Columbia. Yeah.

2428
02:15:57,650 --> 02:16:00,380
Like British Columbia has got
like a big like mean brand new,

2429
02:16:00,381 --> 02:16:04,430
but like the last 20 years like
I don't like, there's not like a,

2430
02:16:04,700 --> 02:16:09,700
like you don't like native Alaskans don't
have an oral history that I know of of

2431
02:16:10,400 --> 02:16:15,110
big foot's the way magic north Pacific
northwest is where it seems that those

2432
02:16:15,111 --> 02:16:16,010
legends came from,

2433
02:16:16,011 --> 02:16:21,011
I was like Pacific northwest had an oral
history and all of of this occurrence

2434
02:16:21,471 --> 02:16:23,060
and it was something they
discussed and it was,

2435
02:16:23,061 --> 02:16:26,720
it was part of their mythology
and legends and explanations,

2436
02:16:27,140 --> 02:16:30,040
but now it's like all
this big in Michigan's

2437
02:16:30,040 --> 02:16:34,200
upper peninsula, you know, like
every state has its own big foot's.

2438
02:16:34,210 --> 02:16:35,290
Ohio has big feet.

2439
02:16:35,350 --> 02:16:39,340
Those it is that the portal and Laskin
bigfoot was created by hallmark. Actually

2440
02:16:42,630 --> 02:16:47,580
the idea, I believe shit man, it really
bullshit. The idea would be Alaska.

2441
02:16:47,600 --> 02:16:51,730
You think? It's not the only reason why
I say I leave, I leave everything open.

2442
02:16:51,820 --> 02:16:54,490
The only reason why I leave
everything open all the time,

2443
02:16:54,491 --> 02:16:57,180
but very rarely why believe in
one way or another back door.

2444
02:16:57,190 --> 02:17:01,180
I know what you're saying and believing
that shits on don't get past the velvet

2445
02:17:01,181 --> 02:17:05,400
rope. I believe in I, there's,
you know, you have to,

2446
02:17:05,410 --> 02:17:08,860
I have to really absolutely know
that something's true or not true.

2447
02:17:08,861 --> 02:17:12,110
And one of the reasons why I
think it's a fascinating subject,

2448
02:17:12,150 --> 02:17:14,440
it's because they know what it
actually used to be an animal.

2449
02:17:14,560 --> 02:17:17,470
There's a thing called the gigantic
Pythagoras age. I think that's what it is.

2450
02:17:17,500 --> 02:17:17,981
I don't think,

2451
02:17:17,981 --> 02:17:21,610
I think the original big foot was that
just some stone guys in the 70s that

2452
02:17:21,611 --> 02:17:24,620
tried to, you know, take a photo of
it. It could have been done. Well,

2453
02:17:24,700 --> 02:17:26,560
the only reason why
that doesn't make sense,

2454
02:17:26,610 --> 02:17:31,090
because the native Americans have over
250 different names for a large man,

2455
02:17:31,091 --> 02:17:34,930
hairy ape thing that lives in the woods.
If it was an intelligent priming,

2456
02:17:35,240 --> 02:17:37,500
it could avoid the bolt.
But it's the thing that's created

2457
02:17:37,600 --> 02:17:38,290
again and again,

2458
02:17:38,290 --> 02:17:40,900
like I was in the Philippines and
they're born in the Philippines,

2459
02:17:40,901 --> 02:17:45,340
out in the jungle.
They had a thing like an equivalent beast.

2460
02:17:45,660 --> 02:17:47,480
I think we all are swaying.

2461
02:17:47,490 --> 02:17:52,060
It was like the os weighing or ASW a
and g and it would like tear you up very

2462
02:17:52,070 --> 02:17:55,830
various ways. We all have this inherent
fear of the unknown and the dark.

2463
02:17:56,010 --> 02:17:59,760
Just from back in the days when we really
hadn't taken an audit of every plant,

2464
02:17:59,790 --> 02:18:01,440
every animal there was on the earth.

2465
02:18:01,740 --> 02:18:04,110
And so there was always legends
and worries and you know,

2466
02:18:04,111 --> 02:18:07,080
the North American Indians only had their
self to go on and who knows? You know,

2467
02:18:07,180 --> 02:18:10,200
you see a fucking grizzly
bear standing up on its back,

2468
02:18:10,201 --> 02:18:14,370
feet in the middle of the woods at dusk
from a distance and you fucking shit

2469
02:18:14,371 --> 02:18:16,920
your pants and run away. You
could convince yourself, you know,

2470
02:18:16,921 --> 02:18:21,750
if you were tall storyteller or you know,
didn't have the best grasp on reality,

2471
02:18:21,751 --> 02:18:25,050
you can convince yourself you saw a giant
man. So you're seeing things that dark.

2472
02:18:25,051 --> 02:18:25,950
It's very possible.

2473
02:18:26,100 --> 02:18:28,320
The only reason why I leave it
open and I don't have an opinion.

2474
02:18:28,321 --> 02:18:31,050
If I had a bet money,
I would say there's probably no big foot,

2475
02:18:31,260 --> 02:18:35,410
but I would be happy if I lost. I'd be
like excited are sexy if they would.

2476
02:18:35,470 --> 02:18:38,970
Actually be elated. And, and you said
earlier, like you said, like the reason

2477
02:18:39,040 --> 02:18:42,910
you find it fascinating,
my thinking that, you know,

2478
02:18:42,911 --> 02:18:46,420
putting my money on the fact that it
doesn't exist like very emphatically.

2479
02:18:46,980 --> 02:18:51,590
Does it then make me think that
the idea of it is it fat is fair.

2480
02:18:51,650 --> 02:18:52,483
I mean the idea of it is

2481
02:18:52,530 --> 02:18:54,570
fascinating.
Hoaxing is so complex.

2482
02:18:54,571 --> 02:18:59,340
If it is just hoaxing cause they've found
dermal ridges on um, on, on footprints,

2483
02:18:59,341 --> 02:19:01,500
which actually indicate
that there's a print,

2484
02:19:01,800 --> 02:19:04,560
like a fingerprint that's coming
off the toe was like, man,

2485
02:19:05,010 --> 02:19:07,950
if that's all hoaxing it's so elaborate.
It's really fascinating.

2486
02:19:08,350 --> 02:19:09,900
This Green Lane happen,

2487
02:19:11,300 --> 02:19:14,480
you know, I mean if you spend
any amount of time, and again I,

2488
02:19:14,481 --> 02:19:18,170
I can't like attack specific examples.
Like, I'm not, I'm not a quick to do that,

2489
02:19:18,171 --> 02:19:23,171
but I know that if you spend any amount
of time looking at sign animal sign in

2490
02:19:24,200 --> 02:19:27,380
the woods, evidence of animals
in the woods tracks things,

2491
02:19:28,580 --> 02:19:33,440
they leave a confused record
and and things, you know,

2492
02:19:33,441 --> 02:19:37,550
animals put their feet down a ways and
turning things on certain surfaces and do

2493
02:19:37,551 --> 02:19:42,020
certain things where you wind up with
strange tracks and sometimes her and shit

2494
02:19:42,021 --> 02:19:42,470
like just,

2495
02:19:42,470 --> 02:19:47,470
and sometimes other sets of circumstances
will create things that you would

2496
02:19:49,341 --> 02:19:53,370
swear it would be prints in the
ground or you know. But again, I,

2497
02:19:53,371 --> 02:19:55,790
I can't like comment a specific examples.
I know what you're saying.

2498
02:19:55,820 --> 02:19:56,870
It's not like,
like the,

2499
02:19:56,890 --> 02:20:01,890
the record of an animal's passing
through mud and snow and sand and things.

2500
02:20:02,410 --> 02:20:04,460
It is often quite confused.

2501
02:20:04,920 --> 02:20:09,440
It can be very difficult to sort it out
and you'll look at something that you

2502
02:20:09,441 --> 02:20:12,990
swear might be a track and you examine
it and then winds up not being attracted

2503
02:20:12,991 --> 02:20:15,770
to. It could just be a bear
and some slippery surface.

2504
02:20:16,010 --> 02:20:19,070
And the bear puts his paw down in the
mud slips and it looks like a giant

2505
02:20:19,071 --> 02:20:21,470
footprint. It could be
something like that. It could
be some guys screwing around.

2506
02:20:21,800 --> 02:20:24,880
Yeah, it could be all the above.
Right to be that as well. And if you,

2507
02:20:24,890 --> 02:20:28,610
you know when you take into account like
just Imana hoaxing that goes down with

2508
02:20:28,611 --> 02:20:32,360
archeological specimens,
people have a motivation beyond,

2509
02:20:32,361 --> 02:20:35,450
it's like whatever kind of money they
make off it just to be just to do it.

2510
02:20:35,480 --> 02:20:38,710
There's a guy like that used to fake
retired about early forms of arrowheads.

2511
02:20:38,720 --> 02:20:39,740
There's like a type of arrowhead,

2512
02:20:39,741 --> 02:20:41,780
a very old type of Harold
had called a full point.

2513
02:20:42,110 --> 02:20:44,020
There's this guy that was by last name,
McCormick

2514
02:20:45,590 --> 02:20:50,590
spent like devoted his life to like
making fake fake Folsom and spinning them

2515
02:20:50,721 --> 02:20:53,030
off to museums but not
even profiting on it.

2516
02:20:53,270 --> 02:20:56,880
Just like try to be like Douche
bags on another one. He just really,

2517
02:20:56,900 --> 02:21:00,940
and now he was so good that it's now
cool if you own a McCormick. It's cool.

2518
02:21:00,970 --> 02:21:01,671
You really,
yeah.

2519
02:21:01,671 --> 02:21:04,670
It'd be like if you imagine you got
made like really great fake Rembrandt's

2520
02:21:05,090 --> 02:21:07,310
later. People are. I'd be
like, it's not a Rembrandt,

2521
02:21:07,311 --> 02:21:08,810
but it's actually this
guy that made some sweet,

2522
02:21:08,811 --> 02:21:13,610
fake Rembrandts and he became like Banksy,
the Banksia Rembrandt's. Who's Banksy?

2523
02:21:13,700 --> 02:21:18,230
Really? You never heard of that guy?
He's a famous graffiti artists. No, no,

2524
02:21:18,680 --> 02:21:21,020
never heard of the movie called
exit through the gift shop.

2525
02:21:21,050 --> 02:21:25,330
You got to Netflix at one really
fascinating, fascinating, very famous,

2526
02:21:26,000 --> 02:21:29,720
very, very talented graffiti
artists. No Man. You know,

2527
02:21:30,230 --> 02:21:33,530
I'll tell you something about me.
When someone tells me to watch a movie,

2528
02:21:33,680 --> 02:21:36,120
you don't want to watch it?
No, I watch it. Really if,

2529
02:21:36,140 --> 02:21:38,630
unless it's someone telling
me like grizzly man, y'all,

2530
02:21:39,660 --> 02:21:42,680
one of the best isn't one of the
greatest movies of all time is one of my

2531
02:21:42,681 --> 02:21:45,680
favorite documents, but I watched it
again the other day, all Herzog stuff.

2532
02:21:45,681 --> 02:21:49,400
Not all of it, but I didn't like
that. The cave one was kind of dry,

2533
02:21:49,890 --> 02:21:52,790
but I was like, I don't know how you could
make a bad move about cave paintings.

2534
02:21:52,791 --> 02:21:55,700
What? He managed to do it, man,
it was really weird. Right?

2535
02:21:55,701 --> 02:21:59,730
I mean it was like almost like his
reverence was annoying. Look at the abuse.

2536
02:21:59,780 --> 02:22:03,320
I wanted a little more like, I
want a little more like, well,

2537
02:22:03,321 --> 02:22:05,210
so what is up with the cave paintings?

2538
02:22:05,630 --> 02:22:08,420
Not from your like dream perspective,

2539
02:22:08,421 --> 02:22:13,100
but can we get like an expert in here to
talk about these firms? Yeah, exactly.

2540
02:22:13,370 --> 02:22:17,630
Well we had a guy in here that was talking
about some of the first works of art,

2541
02:22:17,631 --> 02:22:20,360
you know the first things that men
worshiped and then it made sense that the

2542
02:22:20,361 --> 02:22:22,160
kind of worship these,
these buffalo,

2543
02:22:22,161 --> 02:22:24,650
they withdraw because I
was their sustenance, you
know, you know, they would,

2544
02:22:25,080 --> 02:22:26,460
they would have to like live

2545
02:22:26,490 --> 02:22:29,100
like chasing these, these,
these groups of them.

2546
02:22:29,101 --> 02:22:32,010
And that's how they sustain themselves
and that that's when they find this.

2547
02:22:32,011 --> 02:22:34,320
It's like the first evidence of idolatry.

2548
02:22:34,321 --> 02:22:36,090
The first evidence of
worshiping something.

2549
02:22:36,180 --> 02:22:39,120
But that was a trip you think about
and the cave he's talking about.

2550
02:22:39,290 --> 02:22:43,100
And what was it that bird bird advances
a baseball movie, wasn't it? What was,

2551
02:22:43,101 --> 02:22:47,040
what's her name? What's the name of the
movie? Cave of dreams Cave of forgotten.

2552
02:22:47,610 --> 02:22:49,960
Oh, the Werner Herzog movies.
And we were saying, yeah, it was,

2553
02:22:50,310 --> 02:22:53,520
I don't remember the name of a
cave of forgotten dreams cave of,

2554
02:22:53,940 --> 02:22:56,400
hold on a second. I'll,
I'll, if you draw it.

2555
02:22:58,040 --> 02:23:01,170
So cave, right? Yeah.
You remember. See Dog,

2556
02:23:01,620 --> 02:23:03,830
why are you looking at it up
cave of forgotten dreams. Okay.

2557
02:23:04,020 --> 02:23:07,020
So how do you know what the Hell is Tom?
Oh No.

2558
02:23:07,470 --> 02:23:10,820
Oh that set back the clock on,

2559
02:23:11,400 --> 02:23:15,360
on elaborate painting
by thousands of years.

2560
02:23:15,900 --> 02:23:17,640
But I remember reading at one point,

2561
02:23:17,880 --> 02:23:22,880
something that I even like later summarize
this argument in the book is that

2562
02:23:23,460 --> 02:23:27,330
cave paintings that someone used to
have put forth this theory that cave

2563
02:23:27,331 --> 02:23:31,260
paintings really proliferating at a
period when you were seeing that all that

2564
02:23:31,261 --> 02:23:35,580
megafauna vanishing, you know, all the
animals that went extinct the ice age,

2565
02:23:35,890 --> 02:23:39,330
but like,
it seemed that as they were vanishing,

2566
02:23:39,420 --> 02:23:42,750
people started to replicate them
in art. You know, that makes sense.

2567
02:23:43,830 --> 02:23:47,100
You're seeing the changing of time
and you're summoning them in some way.

2568
02:23:47,130 --> 02:23:50,230
Are they aware of this new
discoveries that they've, uh,

2569
02:23:50,280 --> 02:23:52,170
they've found out that our answers,

2570
02:23:52,590 --> 02:23:57,420
our ancestors had mastered deep
sea fishing 42,000 years ago.

2571
02:23:57,930 --> 02:24:00,120
They found evidence of tuna,

2572
02:24:00,360 --> 02:24:04,170
they found tuna bones and they
found hooks and lines, whereas that,

2573
02:24:04,530 --> 02:24:09,240
this is in, I'll tell you
right now, East Timor,

2574
02:24:09,241 --> 02:24:14,220
north of north of Australia,
which contains the bones
of more than 2,800 fish,

2575
02:24:14,280 --> 02:24:18,800
some of them were caught as
long as 42,000 years ago. Yeah.

2576
02:24:18,810 --> 02:24:21,260
And this is deep sea fishing.
They found the world's or,

2577
02:24:21,261 --> 02:24:26,261
or earliest recorded fish hook made of
Shell and dating from between 23,000 and

2578
02:24:27,211 --> 02:24:30,890
16,000 years ago. That's good
stuff. That's amazing. So they had,

2579
02:24:30,891 --> 02:24:35,070
they had been ocean bound, not just,
not just like shooting it from the bank,

2580
02:24:35,190 --> 02:24:39,420
but they went into deep water and somehow
or another had enough line to pull a

2581
02:24:39,421 --> 02:24:43,200
fucking tuna out of hundreds
of feet of water like that.

2582
02:24:43,230 --> 02:24:46,320
They must have made their own
twine and they must have, you know,

2583
02:24:46,321 --> 02:24:50,940
braided it together and made a fucking,
you'll know deep sea fishing.

2584
02:24:51,270 --> 02:24:54,120
You just, cause you're
in deep water. I mean,

2585
02:24:54,240 --> 02:24:57,900
tuner generally fish very near to
surface. So there is way the hell out. Oh,

2586
02:24:57,901 --> 02:25:00,930
I see what you're saying. They're way the
hell out catching tuna at the surface.

2587
02:25:00,931 --> 02:25:05,010
So, okay, so they don't need some,

2588
02:25:05,011 --> 02:25:08,640
a lot of line man. I mean, you're
strong as fuck to get a pull a man.

2589
02:25:08,641 --> 02:25:11,940
You'd have to play him a little bit. No,
no, I'm not. That's an impressive stuff.

2590
02:25:11,941 --> 02:25:14,830
And I have known now and I like to
know that kind of thing. Know this.

2591
02:25:14,970 --> 02:25:19,590
This was a really recent discovery.
This is a date dated November 25th,

2592
02:25:19,860 --> 02:25:24,040
uh, from the UK mail online and it's,
you know, it's got the photographs of it

2593
02:25:24,040 --> 02:25:27,370
and everything. It's really,
really fascinating. The, the
site where they found it,

2594
02:25:28,330 --> 02:25:31,000
it's a, that's a, that's a
pretty intense discovery.

2595
02:25:31,120 --> 02:25:33,990
And there they were always pushing
back. I mean, on a regular basis,

2596
02:25:34,000 --> 02:25:37,340
pushing back the date when people
figure things out, moving it back,

2597
02:25:37,341 --> 02:25:41,600
and then sometimes moving it forward.
The thing that gets moved back here is,

2598
02:25:41,660 --> 02:25:43,160
is we constantly read,

2599
02:25:43,210 --> 02:25:47,890
are readjusting how long people have
been here in North America has come and

2600
02:25:47,891 --> 02:25:48,401
gone.
You know,

2601
02:25:48,401 --> 02:25:51,400
the one thing that they figured out is
that it's really one of the most shocking

2602
02:25:51,401 --> 02:25:55,990
things is that 10,000 years ago, half
of it was covered by over a mile of ice.

2603
02:25:56,170 --> 02:25:57,760
That's just 10,000 years ago.
I mean,

2604
02:25:57,780 --> 02:26:00,900
that's really amazing when you stop
and think about it. Like when my,

2605
02:26:00,960 --> 02:26:02,590
my home state was drowned,
man,

2606
02:26:02,620 --> 02:26:05,390
I'm sure when you think about
people coming here from,

2607
02:26:05,420 --> 02:26:09,700
from Europe where things have existed in
the, in a pretty static state for far,

2608
02:26:09,701 --> 02:26:11,690
far longer, and people have
been there for far for them.

2609
02:26:11,700 --> 02:26:14,260
When they first came over here,
man, there was just, you know,

2610
02:26:14,261 --> 02:26:18,850
scattered tribes of native Americans.
But what a crazy find, you know,

2611
02:26:18,851 --> 02:26:22,120
this one continent or there's
hardly anybody there. I mean,

2612
02:26:22,121 --> 02:26:25,420
how many Indians were there with her? 1
million over the entire continent. No,

2613
02:26:25,421 --> 02:26:29,230
I think there are many more, but many
more than a million. Yeah, but 90% I mean,

2614
02:26:29,231 --> 02:26:32,250
you know, it could have been
populations at 10 million.

2615
02:26:32,290 --> 02:26:35,550
Some people even say it's 10 million.
That's Miami.

2616
02:26:35,610 --> 02:26:39,310
Is You lost immediately relevant.
I mean, fairly immediate.

2617
02:26:39,340 --> 02:26:44,160
You lost to infectious disease
giant 100% of the population. Wow.

2618
02:26:44,170 --> 02:26:46,870
So a lot of the time when
guys are talking, like when,
when you're looking at,

2619
02:26:46,890 --> 02:26:49,120
you know, like Lewis and Clark or
we've talked about them earlier,

2620
02:26:49,360 --> 02:26:53,050
they come up the Missouri and they
come across as like abandoned village.

2621
02:26:53,300 --> 02:26:56,710
It's like, oh, where'd everybody go? I
mean they're all done and they're like,

2622
02:26:56,711 --> 02:26:58,180
no one's here. And there's
all these, you know,

2623
02:26:58,181 --> 02:27:00,880
there's all those buffalo and no
one's hunting them in. It's crazy.

2624
02:27:01,150 --> 02:27:04,090
But what they don't know, as
you know, 40 years earlier,

2625
02:27:04,091 --> 02:27:07,540
a smallpox epidemic slept through there
and just carry it off. 90% of the people.

2626
02:27:07,960 --> 02:27:11,080
And so because disease would
travel faster than individuals.

2627
02:27:11,380 --> 02:27:13,630
Like you had like what Cabeza de Vaca.
He,

2628
02:27:13,720 --> 02:27:18,220
he was the first guy to kind of walk
along the Gulf coast and the early 1500

2629
02:27:18,840 --> 02:27:21,180
then there's an absence of people and in,
in,

2630
02:27:21,230 --> 02:27:24,430
in Coronado goes up in air
and that amount of time,

2631
02:27:25,630 --> 02:27:28,870
just massive amounts of people were
carried off cause disease always traveled

2632
02:27:28,871 --> 02:27:33,020
faster than that's taking away from
the atrocities that were, you know,

2633
02:27:34,300 --> 02:27:36,800
purposely committed on native.
Like the actual,

2634
02:27:37,300 --> 02:27:42,300
the actual slaughter of people paled
in comparison to the nothing to the

2635
02:27:42,341 --> 02:27:45,100
disease. I mean disease
was like disease. I mean,

2636
02:27:45,850 --> 02:27:47,580
I mean this is the stuff that I'm,
this is the outcome.

2637
02:27:47,640 --> 02:27:52,640
It was by mean people generally accept
the figure is somewhere around 90% of the

2638
02:27:53,171 --> 02:27:56,890
people were carried off by infectious
disease shit. And it's just what you were,

2639
02:27:56,910 --> 02:27:59,170
they had never hear that because
when you pat, when you pass through,

2640
02:27:59,171 --> 02:28:04,150
so you had very small numbers
of individuals passing
through very cold climates

2641
02:28:04,210 --> 02:28:08,710
and the way to come here and they'd just
arrived here without infectious disease.

2642
02:28:08,711 --> 02:28:09,520
They had some stuff,

2643
02:28:09,520 --> 02:28:13,510
like there's debates about what
exact sexually transmitted diseases,

2644
02:28:13,511 --> 02:28:17,650
they add those dirty bitches, but that's
what it was not have, but not having, um,

2645
02:28:18,150 --> 02:28:22,100
you know, like influenza, all that

2646
02:28:22,100 --> 02:28:24,290
stuff we just left behind.
And it's amazing.

2647
02:28:24,291 --> 02:28:25,580
And it's what we were
talking about earlier,

2648
02:28:25,581 --> 02:28:28,010
how you go to a new place and you
drink the water and everyone else,

2649
02:28:28,011 --> 02:28:29,960
there's norm. It's normal
to them. They're used to it.

2650
02:28:29,961 --> 02:28:33,320
They've developed an immunity to it and
the ones that can't hack it died a long

2651
02:28:33,321 --> 02:28:37,580
time ago. But it's incredible when you
think about the timeframe that this entire

2652
02:28:38,240 --> 02:28:42,110
continent was covered in
ice than the ice thaws out.

2653
02:28:42,170 --> 02:28:44,990
Some people are there,
then new ones come in boats.

2654
02:28:44,991 --> 02:28:49,550
Then the whole thing fucking changes. And
it's like, what a short amount of time.

2655
02:28:50,000 --> 02:28:50,301
I mean,

2656
02:28:50,301 --> 02:28:54,440
what an amazingly short amount of time
to just completely transform an entire

2657
02:28:54,441 --> 02:28:58,460
continent. That's one of the reasons
I'm interested in deep history here.

2658
02:28:59,230 --> 02:29:03,410
Um, as, I mean, besides the fact that
I live here, but it's, it's more,

2659
02:29:03,470 --> 02:29:07,640
it's easier to grasp because
things happened like, like Africa.

2660
02:29:07,670 --> 02:29:10,300
You can't even begin to get your
head around human history in Africa.

2661
02:29:10,310 --> 02:29:11,630
It's monkeys because there was no,

2662
02:29:11,660 --> 02:29:14,360
to turn into a smarter must know
beginning point, it wasn't being like,

2663
02:29:14,361 --> 02:29:17,780
I don't know at what point do we call
it Lucy it, when is it a human here?

2664
02:29:17,840 --> 02:29:20,250
It's like no one day,
right?

2665
02:29:20,370 --> 02:29:24,720
One day, not long ago in
a historical sense. Uh,

2666
02:29:24,810 --> 02:29:29,810
dude and his wife and his family
step foot on this thing and enables

2667
02:29:31,230 --> 02:29:36,210
and they found and this and then rate
the pill is just breaking them away. The,

2668
02:29:36,360 --> 02:29:40,060
you know, a lot of people
have these nostalgic ideas
about what the settlers did,

2669
02:29:40,061 --> 02:29:43,540
but if you read some of the accounts
from, from what Columbus is, people did,

2670
02:29:43,541 --> 02:29:47,830
they did horrific, horrific things to the
native Americans that were here. It's a,

2671
02:29:47,831 --> 02:29:51,520
it's amazing how horrific things of
that. I mean, it's like each other. Well,

2672
02:29:51,521 --> 02:29:52,354
the Lakota,

2673
02:29:52,540 --> 02:29:56,500
Lakota people were not known as Lakota
people that are known as the Su Su.

2674
02:29:56,560 --> 02:29:59,180
It means enemy. That's what
they called them. Everybody.

2675
02:29:59,320 --> 02:30:00,850
They called themselves a Lakota people,

2676
02:30:00,851 --> 02:30:05,320
but the other Indians that they would rape
and murder, they called them sue. Yeah,

2677
02:30:05,321 --> 02:30:06,041
they weren't,
they weren't,

2678
02:30:06,041 --> 02:30:10,030
I mean they were living a pure existence
in the sense of they were living off

2679
02:30:10,031 --> 02:30:14,620
the land. They killed a buffalo. They used
every single part of that, that Buffalo,

2680
02:30:14,621 --> 02:30:19,600
they date. There was no
waste tribal. That's a hotly
contested thing, is it really?

2681
02:30:19,840 --> 02:30:23,870
Well, I think wasn't their ethics in that
wasn't there, that happened at times. Uh,

2682
02:30:23,970 --> 02:30:24,803
I say fine.

2683
02:30:25,740 --> 02:30:30,740
Where you'll find like digs at cliff's
sites where they might've run 800 animals

2684
02:30:32,791 --> 02:30:36,300
off a cliff and they find that
the only, the only like, you know,

2685
02:30:36,301 --> 02:30:40,410
a dozen of the carcasses wherever just
articulated, ever caught up. Well,

2686
02:30:40,800 --> 02:30:43,470
might be one of those situations
where he got to do what you gotta do,

2687
02:30:43,920 --> 02:30:46,530
chasing a bunch of Buffalo. It
was off the cliff. It wasn't a,

2688
02:30:46,540 --> 02:30:49,030
it wasn't a crime like weight.
And there's a lot of things like that.

2689
02:30:49,740 --> 02:30:53,340
I remember outside of this fort and
South Dakota one time they killed 1300,

2690
02:30:53,370 --> 02:30:56,850
just cut the tongue's out. Wow. But why?

2691
02:30:57,480 --> 02:31:00,540
To sell them tongues, you're
worth a lot of money. You get,

2692
02:31:00,541 --> 02:31:02,130
I at a time you get like a buck form.

2693
02:31:02,140 --> 02:31:05,370
They traded him for bat for whiskey
and drank it and Jesus Christ,

2694
02:31:05,380 --> 02:31:07,860
I left the hides and we
left and left everything.

2695
02:31:08,040 --> 02:31:12,060
But there's two things going on there.
One, there was already a corruption of,

2696
02:31:12,061 --> 02:31:15,900
of alcohol and almost
like a purposeful giving,

2697
02:31:15,901 --> 02:31:20,280
like a purposeful addiction to people by
like trading alcohol and do. Um, they're,

2698
02:31:20,281 --> 02:31:23,610
the ones going on is when people were
wasting those huge Mazda animals.

2699
02:31:23,611 --> 02:31:24,870
Like we now think of it as waste,

2700
02:31:25,080 --> 02:31:28,730
but they did probably didn't even
have a concept of finiteness. Right.

2701
02:31:28,900 --> 02:31:32,580
It was like they had no idea we could
run something. Yeah, you like use,

2702
02:31:32,640 --> 02:31:36,660
you treat it with respect by using
what you need at that given time.

2703
02:31:36,960 --> 02:31:41,770
And if you follow this very
elaborate set of codes and taboos in,

2704
02:31:41,771 --> 02:31:43,170
in, in, in practices,

2705
02:31:43,171 --> 02:31:47,790
you have your certain that you'll be able
to live this lifestyle into perpetuity.

2706
02:31:48,030 --> 02:31:51,420
And if that means that if you one day
kill a buffalo to celebrate and you just

2707
02:31:51,421 --> 02:31:56,220
cut out its tongue and its liver and
you have a celebration and walk off the

2708
02:31:56,220 --> 02:31:57,930
next day,
it wasn't that you just committed a crime.

2709
02:31:58,160 --> 02:31:59,480
I see.
And by the way,

2710
02:31:59,481 --> 02:32:03,500
that is going to get eaten
by other animals and bacteria
and nature's can absorb

2711
02:32:03,501 --> 02:32:04,290
it back into the earth.

2712
02:32:04,290 --> 02:32:04,891
But you're right,

2713
02:32:04,891 --> 02:32:08,850
like what you brought up is there is
this tendency to really celebrate these

2714
02:32:08,851 --> 02:32:13,310
things and, and it, it frustrates me now
when people act like that, we've, like,

2715
02:32:13,380 --> 02:32:14,640
we as people are,

2716
02:32:14,700 --> 02:32:19,700
have become so violent now and it's like
violence touches a smaller percentage

2717
02:32:20,131 --> 02:32:23,900
of our lives now than ever.
The fact that you can get to be that,

2718
02:32:23,910 --> 02:32:27,570
I know people who've gotten to be in their
late thirties have never laid eyes on

2719
02:32:27,571 --> 02:32:28,404
a dead person.

2720
02:32:28,580 --> 02:32:31,010
Yeah.
Would have been impossible.

2721
02:32:31,130 --> 02:32:34,490
It's like unheard of and they
must not have email, right.

2722
02:32:34,520 --> 02:32:36,740
There's no way they have an internet
connection and never even looked at

2723
02:32:36,741 --> 02:32:38,090
someone's going to send
them some dead people.

2724
02:32:38,720 --> 02:32:41,090
You can just look it up and just
send them to you, man. People,

2725
02:32:41,150 --> 02:32:43,040
if you have friends,
hey, check out this guy,

2726
02:32:43,070 --> 02:32:45,110
they're going to send it ups and
they're gonna send you a video of a dude

2727
02:32:45,111 --> 02:32:47,360
getting run over by a truck or something.
But

2728
02:32:49,260 --> 02:32:53,210
I see the easiest time of human history
for sure. Less violent, the least violent.

2729
02:32:53,310 --> 02:32:56,570
I think it's like pretty gravy.
We have such a, like a, you know,

2730
02:32:56,580 --> 02:32:58,170
maturing sense of morality.

2731
02:32:58,470 --> 02:33:02,250
That's awesome because we're aware that
we don't need to be in Iraq blowing

2732
02:33:02,251 --> 02:33:06,930
things up. So the fact that
this is happening and it's
so unjustified and it's so

2733
02:33:06,931 --> 02:33:11,130
ridiculous and there's so much information
that shows like very clearly that

2734
02:33:11,131 --> 02:33:15,420
it's all been done under the auspices of
lies and bullshit that, you know, it's,

2735
02:33:15,430 --> 02:33:18,720
it's, it's offensive to people that
that exists in this day and age.

2736
02:33:18,721 --> 02:33:20,790
So that's why people run up and say,
well,

2737
02:33:20,791 --> 02:33:24,120
there's so much war and it's so much
violence and it's so ridiculous and we're

2738
02:33:24,121 --> 02:33:26,220
so doomed.
They're right.

2739
02:33:26,430 --> 02:33:31,070
But in perspective to the
history of the human race there,

2740
02:33:31,110 --> 02:33:33,630
they're not really, right.
It's a pretty cushy time.

2741
02:33:33,870 --> 02:33:35,280
As long as you're not in the more zone.

2742
02:33:35,370 --> 02:33:36,000
Yeah,
because,

2743
02:33:36,000 --> 02:33:40,620
well I think that's the
thing about violence is is
so you know it's so focalized

2744
02:33:40,621 --> 02:33:43,980
now and little spots, but you look
at these areas we're talking about.

2745
02:33:43,981 --> 02:33:47,520
I think that violence used
to be just omnipresent. Yeah.

2746
02:33:47,550 --> 02:33:50,480
Like you know like here in town,
like out of the La Brea tar pits,

2747
02:33:50,490 --> 02:33:53,880
like one human body came
out of the La Brea tar pits.

2748
02:33:53,910 --> 02:33:57,420
It was like a woman from 9,000 years
ago who had been struck in the head with

2749
02:33:57,421 --> 02:33:58,830
some kind of Tomahawk object.

2750
02:33:59,190 --> 02:34:03,210
The guy can work man who comes out of
the Columbia River from sometime around.

2751
02:34:03,211 --> 02:34:05,130
Then he's got an Arrow
head buried in them.

2752
02:34:05,430 --> 02:34:08,460
That guy they pull out of the
Italian Alps from 7,000 years ago.

2753
02:34:08,490 --> 02:34:11,780
He's got two Arrow heads buried in
them. Yeah. It's like you can't, Yup.

2754
02:34:11,910 --> 02:34:13,030
If you find like an,

2755
02:34:13,680 --> 02:34:18,010
you can't find the old skeleton that old
and pulled up without having to be that

2756
02:34:18,190 --> 02:34:22,000
this guy had been mixing it up with
other people in a highly violent, yeah.

2757
02:34:22,690 --> 02:34:25,330
It's funny because the older pro,
the primates go,

2758
02:34:25,331 --> 02:34:29,440
the more they have marks on him from
big cats and as they get more and more

2759
02:34:29,441 --> 02:34:33,610
modern, they're, they're fucked up by
humans. Yeah. The ice man. Right. He'd,

2760
02:34:33,620 --> 02:34:38,050
he'd been, he'd been fucked up a couple
of times. Right. The cat though, man,

2761
02:34:38,080 --> 02:34:42,070
he made some sweet stuff to his shoes
are made out of a variety of different

2762
02:34:42,071 --> 02:34:45,130
leathers and insulate boss.
He was bad. Amazing. Fine.

2763
02:34:45,310 --> 02:34:48,010
If I could hang out with any guy,
like if people said,

2764
02:34:48,011 --> 02:34:50,980
if you could hang out with anyone
alive or dead, it would be the ice man.

2765
02:34:52,030 --> 02:34:53,560
That guy, I would love old. Was He when?

2766
02:34:53,561 --> 02:34:57,340
When the weight is seven seven
thousand seven thousand years ago. Wow.

2767
02:34:57,820 --> 02:35:01,240
He was tattooed 7,000 years ago.
People lived like that.

2768
02:35:01,300 --> 02:35:05,350
It's a little bit of goddamn blink of an
eye. Right. His name is [inaudible] Uzi.

2769
02:35:05,710 --> 02:35:08,410
Yeah. That's what they type
it in. You don't know what
his real fucking mammos no,

2770
02:35:08,450 --> 02:35:11,110
they gave him a handle.
I guy was a bad ass though.

2771
02:35:11,350 --> 02:35:13,050
That's a real hunter right there.
Yeah.

2772
02:35:13,660 --> 02:35:17,370
Or he didn't Hunt Highway Z. Otz. Yeah,

2773
02:35:17,380 --> 02:35:19,870
he didn't have high highwire they'll
highway or offensive for that dude.

2774
02:35:19,900 --> 02:35:23,470
He's fair. Chase. How do you feel
about, I know there's a big issue.

2775
02:35:23,471 --> 02:35:27,640
I believe it's an Idaho on the
introduction of a Canadian wolves,

2776
02:35:28,000 --> 02:35:30,880
those big ass fucking giant gray wolves.
And they're like,

2777
02:35:30,950 --> 02:35:35,110
currently it's a reintroduction,
but there are different types of Wolf.

2778
02:35:35,111 --> 02:35:39,000
It's a different species than the
native wolf. There are native timber,

2779
02:35:39,001 --> 02:35:41,470
timber will like gray wolf,
timber wolves. It's the same wall.

2780
02:35:41,740 --> 02:35:43,870
So why are they so small and
Idaho and they're so big,

2781
02:35:43,871 --> 02:35:45,720
the ones that come from
Canada because they, you know,

2782
02:35:45,980 --> 02:35:47,860
one thing you wind up
with is, well, you know,

2783
02:35:47,861 --> 02:35:51,040
you had the red wolf down
small in New Mexico. Yeah,

2784
02:35:51,041 --> 02:35:56,020
but I mean generally mammals tend to be
much bigger at the northern end of their

2785
02:35:56,050 --> 02:36:00,190
range. So you look at a mature
deer in Alberta, he's going to be,

2786
02:36:00,220 --> 02:36:03,570
you ain't might be 250 pounds.
You take the same species,

2787
02:36:03,590 --> 02:36:06,400
deer in Florida and he's going to
be a hundred pounds. And she's like,

2788
02:36:06,460 --> 02:36:09,010
mammals are always bigger at the northern
end of the extreme because what you

2789
02:36:09,011 --> 02:36:13,750
wind up having is you have less surface
area and it's easier for them to retain

2790
02:36:13,751 --> 02:36:16,750
more. If you have more surface area,
it's easier to get rid of warmth,

2791
02:36:16,990 --> 02:36:18,380
so the fact that you're pulling like the,

2792
02:36:18,381 --> 02:36:23,020
you might go get some big ass wolves out
of northern Canada and bring them in.

2793
02:36:23,110 --> 02:36:26,320
I don't think that's the issue
of them being different sides.

2794
02:36:26,321 --> 02:36:28,390
It's all the same species.
It's a gray wolf. Oh,

2795
02:36:28,391 --> 02:36:33,391
I support both the reintroduction of
wolves and I support the eventual control

2796
02:36:36,431 --> 02:36:38,830
through hunting of those wolves.
They're already hunting them.

2797
02:36:38,831 --> 02:36:41,800
There's a picture of this check with
this giant fucking Wolf that she shot.

2798
02:36:41,960 --> 02:36:45,510
They're a huge man. Yeah. Then
another big critters take names.

2799
02:36:45,550 --> 02:36:48,430
That's like a very like that
right there is one of the,

2800
02:36:49,090 --> 02:36:54,090
you know in like and hunting and
conservation issues and ethics issues.

2801
02:36:54,160 --> 02:36:57,610
The debate about what to do about these
wolves, but this one woman in this photo,

2802
02:36:57,910 --> 02:36:59,000
this one right here,
and see this fit.

2803
02:36:59,470 --> 02:37:04,090
Their official stories at the wolf was
running up to attack this woman and she

2804
02:37:04,500 --> 02:37:07,360
had a of Bose down, shot it with
a handgun. Here's the thing,

2805
02:37:07,810 --> 02:37:10,330
I'm not looking at your computer,
but you have to, I trust you.

2806
02:37:10,331 --> 02:37:13,690
You're a little more cautious than to
just start typing stuff in and balls show.

2807
02:37:13,691 --> 02:37:16,310
She could be full of Shit and she
could've been out there poaching.

2808
02:37:16,550 --> 02:37:17,320
And

2809
02:37:17,320 --> 02:37:21,880
besides, there is a wolf season
going on right now. There,

2810
02:37:22,200 --> 02:37:26,270
there is some, there was wolf hunting
going on this fall and winter in,

2811
02:37:26,320 --> 02:37:28,610
in a number of western states.
And,

2812
02:37:28,700 --> 02:37:30,770
oh, wait a minute. Here's a
store. This is really interesting.

2813
02:37:30,771 --> 02:37:32,660
Is this from the outfitter?
Listen, let me tell you this.

2814
02:37:33,260 --> 02:37:38,260
He took a group of nine out of state
elk archery hunters from the Great Lakes

2815
02:37:38,360 --> 02:37:43,130
region. They ended up calling a pack
of 17 wolves by elk cow calling. Oh,

2816
02:37:43,131 --> 02:37:45,560
there you go.
Big Ass fucking group of wolves.

2817
02:37:45,680 --> 02:37:50,030
And none of the hunters had a side arm
or a wolf tag and it was a very traumatic

2818
02:37:50,031 --> 02:37:53,560
experience that will surrounded
them. It says all of the hunters, uh,

2819
02:37:53,630 --> 02:37:55,430
went home early,
very disturbed,

2820
02:37:55,431 --> 02:37:58,310
claiming these wolves were very
different from the Great Lakes wolves.

2821
02:37:58,400 --> 02:38:01,790
These Idaho Wolves actually hunt
you and they're not afraid of you.

2822
02:38:02,310 --> 02:38:05,430
None of that. No one's
been, they had a documented,

2823
02:38:05,431 --> 02:38:10,250
the first documented wolf kill in decades
in Alaska and one woman. They've never,

2824
02:38:11,370 --> 02:38:15,930
anyone who's afraid of wolves is
just a pussy. Who's afraid of stuff?

2825
02:38:16,380 --> 02:38:20,970
Wait a minute of wolf killed a woman.
You have one person. Like what?

2826
02:38:21,000 --> 02:38:21,760
How often

2827
02:38:21,760 --> 02:38:23,190
we'll come in contact with wool.

2828
02:38:23,820 --> 02:38:26,520
Well you know when we got killed by
coyotes in Canada a couple of years ago,

2829
02:38:26,650 --> 02:38:30,160
well it looks like people like
people get killed by some of the,

2830
02:38:30,161 --> 02:38:33,910
probably got killed by domestic dogs. But
I mean like if you're afraid of wolves,

2831
02:38:33,970 --> 02:38:37,870
it's like I would suggest like those
guys and it's too bad they're from the

2832
02:38:37,870 --> 02:38:39,280
Great Lakes State.
Cause that's my home area.

2833
02:38:39,820 --> 02:38:44,170
I would tell those guys the
day are some of the law, the,

2834
02:38:44,230 --> 02:38:45,850
I'm glad they're not in the woods anymore.

2835
02:38:45,851 --> 02:38:49,240
If you would actually leave because of
some wolves. Well there's so big man.

2836
02:38:49,270 --> 02:38:52,930
Look at the size of this photo. It's
big. You've seen that, that wolf. Oh,

2837
02:38:52,931 --> 02:38:55,090
you know what? You know what that,
that won't, let me see that picture.

2838
02:38:55,091 --> 02:38:58,330
I think you're looking at it
online at hoax. That photo.

2839
02:38:58,650 --> 02:39:01,850
That's a that that wolf was killed
in Europe. It was, yeah. That's not,

2840
02:39:01,870 --> 02:39:02,703
you're looking at it online.

2841
02:39:02,910 --> 02:39:05,380
It says a Canadian gray, 180
pound male Canadian. Yeah.

2842
02:39:05,400 --> 02:39:09,270
Great nod that pictures made the round
recently shot near Central Idaho.

2843
02:39:09,271 --> 02:39:13,160
It's horse shit that this is from the
Idaho Observer, man. Let me see this.

2844
02:39:13,590 --> 02:39:18,530
June, 2009 the either the Observer. Yeah.
Is it a dude holding her while dude?

2845
02:39:18,590 --> 02:39:21,830
Yeah.
Maybe the Idaho Observer got hoaxed

2846
02:39:24,590 --> 02:39:27,720
Tony, that wolf is not what you
picture has been making the rounds

2847
02:39:27,760 --> 02:39:32,760
from 35 transplanted specimens as of
1996 the federally reintroduced Canadian

2848
02:39:33,251 --> 02:39:37,180
Gray Wolves have multiplied and spread
throughout the northern two thirds of

2849
02:39:37,181 --> 02:39:39,760
Idaho and are decimating wild game hurts.

2850
02:39:39,940 --> 02:39:43,120
This nonessential program is a
complete failure according to some,

2851
02:39:43,480 --> 02:39:48,480
but a master stroke in a dial diabolical
federal occupational planning.

2852
02:39:48,880 --> 02:39:52,840
And what they're saying is that there's
more than 4,000 of these and that they

2853
02:39:52,841 --> 02:39:56,830
were going to let them get to a point
of a 1500 and then they were going to

2854
02:39:56,831 --> 02:39:58,810
start calling them.
But now it's gotten like pretty adult

2855
02:39:58,980 --> 02:40:00,230
Mohamed.
Here's the promise.

2856
02:40:00,290 --> 02:40:03,890
Nothing you're saying like nothing
you're saying is really debatable.

2857
02:40:04,100 --> 02:40:08,480
Those statistics and facts
minus the commentary are true.

2858
02:40:09,050 --> 02:40:12,800
But what you're running up against is
you're looking at a piece of propaganda

2859
02:40:12,801 --> 02:40:15,360
put out by a guy who's like
categorically anti wolf.

2860
02:40:15,361 --> 02:40:20,361
I would gather that photo you're looking
at has made the rounds and has been

2861
02:40:20,881 --> 02:40:24,120
attributed to being killed in a
number of states by number of people.

2862
02:40:24,330 --> 02:40:27,060
There was this one is the size of
that fucking thing. This got killed.

2863
02:40:29,530 --> 02:40:33,570
That's another one. Like, so there's
some big wolves getting killed,

2864
02:40:33,980 --> 02:40:37,020
but there's big wolves that
were way bigger than the
ones that were living there

2865
02:40:37,110 --> 02:40:39,930
when they introduced these new wolves.
These new world's got a lot bigger.

2866
02:40:40,750 --> 02:40:45,720
Uh, I don't, I don't think
the hunt, not packs of 20.

2867
02:40:47,160 --> 02:40:50,370
It's not a first name. Okay, well listen,
I, I'm out. That's why I'm asking you.

2868
02:40:50,640 --> 02:40:52,470
They're fucking beautiful man.
I'll tell you that.

2869
02:40:52,620 --> 02:40:57,360
There's a photo of some dark one. Look at
that. There's such wild looking animals,

2870
02:40:57,361 --> 02:41:01,410
man. Oh, the grayed out.
Incredible. Yeah. I, I had a,

2871
02:41:01,420 --> 02:41:05,850
a friend of mine and uh, he went and, uh,
went wolf hunting and I was like, wow,

2872
02:41:05,851 --> 02:41:08,610
what the fuck man,
why would you hunt wolves?

2873
02:41:08,740 --> 02:41:09,530
Well,

2874
02:41:09,530 --> 02:41:14,290
I think that we have an obligation to
try to manage a population if we have an

2875
02:41:14,291 --> 02:41:17,920
obligation to do like
targeted reintroductions and
things that we've extra pay

2876
02:41:17,921 --> 02:41:18,491
it through human use,

2877
02:41:18,491 --> 02:41:22,480
but I don't then think that that means
that it becomes perpetually off limits

2878
02:41:22,481 --> 02:41:23,890
and we can't do any management.
I mean,

2879
02:41:23,891 --> 02:41:27,320
we manage it by bringing it there and
I think that we need to maintain the

2880
02:41:27,321 --> 02:41:28,930
control on it because I don't think,

2881
02:41:29,380 --> 02:41:32,830
I think that we have other obligations
to other interested parties.

2882
02:41:33,100 --> 02:41:34,660
And to say that you're going to bring,

2883
02:41:35,620 --> 02:41:39,250
besides that one, there's another one is
huge. So I have the one shot and Idaho.

2884
02:41:39,400 --> 02:41:43,090
He's a fucking giant welds man. These
are huge, and I'm with you though,

2885
02:41:43,091 --> 02:41:46,270
but I think that's the important thing
is that people need to understand that

2886
02:41:46,570 --> 02:41:49,000
they need to be managed and
that they were brought in.

2887
02:41:49,001 --> 02:41:52,390
They were managed in the first place. The
whole, they didn't exist there before.

2888
02:41:52,450 --> 02:41:55,480
No, they did. But they were mismanaged.
I mean they, they existed there.

2889
02:41:55,980 --> 02:41:59,100
I would say that right in the Dick.
If I see it my backyard,

2890
02:41:59,160 --> 02:42:03,240
I'll tell you right now, manage
mismanaged. Fuck you. Go Fuck Yourself.

2891
02:42:03,241 --> 02:42:07,440
That giant ass teeth snarling.
Motherfucker was in my
backyard looking to eat me.

2892
02:42:07,510 --> 02:42:08,590
They were there.

2893
02:42:08,650 --> 02:42:13,650
We had wolves and we wiped them out
through poisoning and various uncontrolled

2894
02:42:15,991 --> 02:42:16,541
things like we did.

2895
02:42:16,541 --> 02:42:20,610
We didn't have a system in place to
preserve the resource or some people might

2896
02:42:20,611 --> 02:42:21,690
object to the term resource,

2897
02:42:21,691 --> 02:42:26,040
but we didn't have a system in place to
make a sustainable population. Later.

2898
02:42:26,490 --> 02:42:31,490
We tried to right that wrong by doing
reintroductions and some people have a

2899
02:42:32,581 --> 02:42:37,581
hard time accepting the fact that we could
make it jump from having been that we

2900
02:42:38,340 --> 02:42:39,690
screwed up and wipe them out.

2901
02:42:40,200 --> 02:42:43,600
Now we put them back and accepting the
fact that we would now make a jump to, to,

2902
02:42:43,720 --> 02:42:45,180
to start killing them.

2903
02:42:45,220 --> 02:42:48,220
Right. But, but as, as some
by the argument at all,

2904
02:42:48,230 --> 02:42:52,480
it's not the same breed if it is a much
larger margin wolf and a lot of people

2905
02:42:52,481 --> 02:42:55,090
think, and that's the stupidities,
that this is a bigger animal.

2906
02:42:55,270 --> 02:42:57,280
This is an animal that's
not native to this area.

2907
02:42:57,281 --> 02:42:58,750
The genetics are
different than the animal.

2908
02:42:59,030 --> 02:43:03,980
I don't think you, you know, to get
into what is a breed and a species,

2909
02:43:04,010 --> 02:43:07,610
it's the same I'm telling you.
Right. But there's the same species.

2910
02:43:07,820 --> 02:43:11,770
You might have their bigger, right.
I don't think there's any way.

2911
02:43:12,000 --> 02:43:15,460
There's no way to argue that because you
don't have enough specimens of old ones

2912
02:43:15,461 --> 02:43:16,470
to tell if they were bigger.
Now

2913
02:43:16,600 --> 02:43:20,290
forget what I said about not hunting
one. I want that rug. Yeah, it's nice.

2914
02:43:20,291 --> 02:43:23,590
It's beautiful. I need
that. Come on, man. So big,

2915
02:43:23,591 --> 02:43:28,540
crazy giant fucking as long
as you've found out that
wolf was a cunt. I was like,

2916
02:43:28,541 --> 02:43:32,150
this is one wolf. He was fucking with
all the other wolves. Nobody likes cows,

2917
02:43:32,230 --> 02:43:34,900
an asshole.
He's raping all the female wolves.

2918
02:43:34,930 --> 02:43:38,470
Nobody's going to miss that
shithead. He ate everybody sheep. So

2919
02:43:38,760 --> 02:43:43,280
if you have blue some houses
down, you might get some, really,

2920
02:43:47,430 --> 02:43:49,590
you might get some really big wolves by,

2921
02:43:49,740 --> 02:43:52,830
maybe you're taking some walls and
putting it in and do it like a place where

2922
02:43:52,831 --> 02:43:57,300
they have very little competition with
one another and they have a great food

2923
02:43:57,301 --> 02:44:00,270
resource and they're living to be,
uh,

2924
02:44:00,271 --> 02:44:04,200
an older age because there's
not predation on the wolves.

2925
02:44:04,230 --> 02:44:05,430
So maybe you're getting some big wolfs,

2926
02:44:05,790 --> 02:44:10,790
but you can't get hung up on this idea
that somehow they screwed up and brought

2927
02:44:11,791 --> 02:44:15,390
a bigger wolf into an area where it
didn't belong. It's like the gray wolf.

2928
02:44:15,630 --> 02:44:20,040
Uh Huh. Now you put those animals in
Idaho, we're getting to be about 70,

2929
02:44:20,041 --> 02:44:23,340
80 pounds and these walls that
they've introduced from Canada,

2930
02:44:23,341 --> 02:44:26,970
I get to be 200 pounds.
That's a different animal. I,

2931
02:44:28,200 --> 02:44:29,580
I mean,
I'm just reading what they're saying.

2932
02:44:29,910 --> 02:44:33,540
They're saying that this is the major
issue is that this is a larger animal is

2933
02:44:33,541 --> 02:44:37,440
that's not true. I'm not, you're saying
it's not animal, no matter what he does,

2934
02:44:37,800 --> 02:44:39,210
it's the same species.
Okay.

2935
02:44:39,290 --> 02:44:42,410
I'm not equipped to talk about how
big the average weight is. I have,

2936
02:44:42,470 --> 02:44:47,470
I don't know how anyone would really
have the data to show me what the average

2937
02:44:49,101 --> 02:44:53,440
weight was before wolves were extirpated
in that area and what the average way

2938
02:44:53,441 --> 02:44:57,350
it is now, and I don't try, and as
much as I, I've enjoyed talking to you,

2939
02:44:57,590 --> 02:45:00,190
I don't trust the,
the,

2940
02:45:00,220 --> 02:45:04,100
the random pages that you're pulling up
or really pull my information off that.

2941
02:45:04,640 --> 02:45:06,220
Yeah, I understand. It's,

2942
02:45:06,250 --> 02:45:09,400
I think that you're getting into something
that's a bit more complicated and

2943
02:45:09,440 --> 02:45:12,830
something that's not really easy to
pin down. Why I don't have an opinion.

2944
02:45:12,831 --> 02:45:14,370
There's a lot of ways there's not,

2945
02:45:14,420 --> 02:45:17,840
there's a lot of ways in which
you would find the animals under.

2946
02:45:17,841 --> 02:45:20,480
Some sets of circumstances tend
to get really big. The same way.

2947
02:45:20,630 --> 02:45:25,010
If you take two pigs out of the same
litter, these hogs, Zillow's right,

2948
02:45:25,070 --> 02:45:26,420
two brothers out of the same litter,

2949
02:45:26,810 --> 02:45:31,810
put one out in the wild and the arid
area and put one in a corn bin and then

2950
02:45:32,661 --> 02:45:35,600
tell me that the one most have been a
different species cause he got really big.

2951
02:45:36,500 --> 02:45:40,190
Right. I see what you're
saying. So I don't really know.

2952
02:45:40,300 --> 02:45:44,760
I'm not familiar with,
even though humans are humans and um,

2953
02:45:44,830 --> 02:45:45,350
you,

2954
02:45:45,350 --> 02:45:49,430
you went to Africa and you've got the
biggest people and you made them slaves

2955
02:45:49,640 --> 02:45:53,030
and then you brought him over here and
then you made the mate and have big,

2956
02:45:53,031 --> 02:45:54,170
giant babies.

2957
02:45:54,320 --> 02:45:58,940
Even though that that person could breed
with anyone here and they are in fact

2958
02:45:58,941 --> 02:46:02,750
human and of the same species. There's
no doubt genetically they're different.

2959
02:46:02,960 --> 02:46:03,793
They're bigger.
Sure.

2960
02:46:04,290 --> 02:46:05,040
There's no,

2961
02:46:05,040 --> 02:46:08,520
I mean there's no doubt that any
populations that have been separated for a

2962
02:46:08,521 --> 02:46:10,130
significant amount of
time becoming some way

2963
02:46:10,130 --> 02:46:15,080
genetically different. Tricky to
bring in. I mean look at this again.

2964
02:46:15,110 --> 02:46:16,480
I don't know nearly enough.

2965
02:46:16,520 --> 02:46:20,590
The only reason why I'm bringing this up
is the argument of all these anti looks.

2966
02:46:20,930 --> 02:46:22,040
This is the doom and gloom.

2967
02:46:22,041 --> 02:46:24,260
I'm scared that wolves are kind
of come get me approach. You know,

2968
02:46:24,261 --> 02:46:27,680
it's like these people that are
upset saying he's just some big,

2969
02:46:27,681 --> 02:46:31,150
I managed and they're fucking up there
and they would have preferred it.

2970
02:46:31,300 --> 02:46:34,430
These are big ass and they would prefer,
they brought some smaller wolves.

2971
02:46:34,630 --> 02:46:37,580
They would prefer that they would be
wolves that are the same size as the

2972
02:46:37,581 --> 02:46:40,190
indigenous was the old kind of
the walls that are still there.

2973
02:46:40,191 --> 02:46:42,770
They still exist tonight. Oh, they're
still native walls. They just,

2974
02:46:42,771 --> 02:46:45,470
these Canadian wolves. They're saying
again, this is what they're saying.

2975
02:46:45,680 --> 02:46:48,440
I just think, what do you, what
is your dirty hands on management?

2976
02:46:49,630 --> 02:46:52,100
There've been wolves that big is
that we're saying that native ones.

2977
02:46:52,750 --> 02:46:56,750
Uh, okay. There's two.

2978
02:46:57,440 --> 02:47:02,440
You have some natural reintroduction of
wolves going on in the northern rock.

2979
02:47:02,900 --> 02:47:05,840
What is the benefit of that? You,
well, let me, let me explain.

2980
02:47:05,841 --> 02:47:10,610
I'm saying there was definitely a period
of time when you were not gonna find in

2981
02:47:10,611 --> 02:47:14,330
the greater Yellowstone area,
for instance, wolves were
pretty much gone. However,

2982
02:47:14,510 --> 02:47:19,510
there's always been some number of wolves
that would drift in from Canada and

2983
02:47:21,771 --> 02:47:25,340
come in and maybe not have like
really established populations,

2984
02:47:25,341 --> 02:47:28,310
but they would come in and they would
drift out and they would come in and drift

2985
02:47:28,311 --> 02:47:31,400
out.
At the point of time we're in right now,

2986
02:47:31,880 --> 02:47:36,300
we have a lot of animals there.

2987
02:47:36,330 --> 02:47:40,580
There are a lot of like thriving wolf
packs in the northern Rockies that derived

2988
02:47:40,581 --> 02:47:41,390
from animals.

2989
02:47:41,390 --> 02:47:45,680
We specifically brought
in and reintroduced and
there's a lot of animals that

2990
02:47:45,681 --> 02:47:49,520
are probably derived from animals
that naturally drifted in from Canada.

2991
02:47:50,000 --> 02:47:55,000
If they're saying that somehow the ones
that were reintroduced tend to be larger

2992
02:47:57,950 --> 02:47:59,000
than the ones that were,

2993
02:47:59,001 --> 02:48:03,680
are naturally spreading out and
distributing into these areas from Canada.

2994
02:48:04,730 --> 02:48:07,670
I don't really know if that's really the
question we're talking about right now.

2995
02:48:07,671 --> 02:48:09,020
I don't know how to answer that.
I,

2996
02:48:09,030 --> 02:48:13,520
I'd have to look more carefully at what
you're looking at and I'd have to ask

2997
02:48:13,521 --> 02:48:17,300
someone who's familiar with
it in an unbiased sense.

2998
02:48:17,360 --> 02:48:21,800
If wolves in fact came from
this land of real big bigness.

2999
02:48:22,280 --> 02:48:26,480
I know that you will get for a number
of factors. You will find that bears,

3000
02:48:26,510 --> 02:48:30,230
for instance, bears and Pennsylvania,
black bears and Pennsylvania.

3001
02:48:30,950 --> 02:48:33,410
Same species is black bears in Montana,

3002
02:48:33,411 --> 02:48:37,130
but the ones in Pennsylvania you get way
bigger than they do in Montana. Also.

3003
02:48:37,310 --> 02:48:40,700
The ones in Pennsylvania
are almost invariably black.

3004
02:48:41,060 --> 02:48:45,740
The ones in Montana have are tend
to be chocolate, Brown and blond.

3005
02:48:45,890 --> 02:48:49,250
They find that if you're in a area
that has over 20 inches of rainfall,

3006
02:48:49,910 --> 02:48:53,300
you tend to have more jet black bears.

3007
02:48:53,600 --> 02:48:57,080
If they have an area with a lot of
mast like acorns and beach nuts,

3008
02:48:57,320 --> 02:48:59,990
they tend to get much bigger
than the area where they don't.

3009
02:49:00,320 --> 02:49:04,550
Bears that have access to salmon tend to
get much bigger than areas that don't.

3010
02:49:05,480 --> 02:49:08,580
A lot of those things are
of words they're living,

3011
02:49:08,850 --> 02:49:12,480
so if a bear is living in
Pennsylvania getting huge on acorns

3012
02:49:14,640 --> 02:49:18,270
and you bring that bear and put
them in the air environment,

3013
02:49:18,570 --> 02:49:21,750
he's going to change.
It's like you don't,

3014
02:49:22,110 --> 02:49:25,740
you don't know that he's
going to be continued to be
like to put off giant bears.

3015
02:49:25,770 --> 02:49:29,250
He might be taking like bears that are
genetically equal and you're putting them

3016
02:49:29,251 --> 02:49:32,880
in prime habitat and giving them all
the available resources they need to

3017
02:49:32,881 --> 02:49:34,590
achieve their maximum size.

3018
02:49:35,880 --> 02:49:40,110
It would make sense to me if you had an
area that had no population of wolves

3019
02:49:40,410 --> 02:49:45,410
and you had a population of deer and elk
who are not accustomed to predation by

3020
02:49:45,481 --> 02:49:46,314
wolves,

3021
02:49:46,500 --> 02:49:51,220
and you took some wolves from an area
where they tended to reach maximum size of

3022
02:49:51,221 --> 02:49:55,320
120 pounds and you introduce them
into this area and they live without

3023
02:49:55,321 --> 02:50:00,321
competition from other packs and they
have access to massive supplies of meat

3024
02:50:00,690 --> 02:50:02,130
that has no idea what they are.

3025
02:50:02,250 --> 02:50:05,820
And then you come and tell me that 20
years later you find that these walls that

3026
02:50:05,821 --> 02:50:10,821
used to be around an average of 120
pounds are now averaging 150 pounds.

3027
02:50:11,040 --> 02:50:14,490
I wouldn't be remotely surprised by that.
Okay. That totally makes sense to me.

3028
02:50:14,670 --> 02:50:15,421
And you know,

3029
02:50:15,421 --> 02:50:18,090
of course you always have
to throw everything through
the fearmongering filter

3030
02:50:18,180 --> 02:50:20,160
and everybody's worried
that the wolves are coming.

3031
02:50:20,520 --> 02:50:23,600
I disagree that you're a pussy if you
get killed by a wolf because one person,

3032
02:50:23,601 --> 02:50:26,760
no, you're not a pushing to get killed
by frank. Your Pussy. If you're afraid.

3033
02:50:26,790 --> 02:50:29,190
I think of your post. If you don't
go in the woods because of wolf.

3034
02:50:29,220 --> 02:50:33,960
Did you see the Liam Neeson trailer for
the movie? The gray surrounded by wolves,

3035
02:50:33,961 --> 02:50:36,210
bro.
I was supposed to review that.

3036
02:50:37,090 --> 02:50:39,900
I was supposed to review that moved from
outside but I could go really to the,

3037
02:50:39,901 --> 02:50:43,470
I could never, they could never
line up the screening Fao. Dammit.

3038
02:50:43,920 --> 02:50:47,940
Why would I was supposed to review it
through the Lens of how well does this

3039
02:50:47,941 --> 02:50:50,730
really accurately portray
wilderness last word on the subject.

3040
02:50:50,731 --> 02:50:52,860
What is the benefit of
bringing these wolves back?

3041
02:50:53,010 --> 02:50:57,060
Cause it to thin out the herds of the
benefit to bring those bulls back would be

3042
02:50:57,061 --> 02:50:57,300
to,

3043
02:50:57,300 --> 02:51:02,300
to write some of the wrongs
we've committed against
the environment and to try

3044
02:51:02,761 --> 02:51:07,761
to help create a intact ecosystem with
all of the players present on the land

3045
02:51:09,300 --> 02:51:13,710
and make things extra scary
in the woods. Yeah. If that,

3046
02:51:13,711 --> 02:51:17,940
if you want to go camping, he hit
you hear that shit outside your door,

3047
02:51:19,020 --> 02:51:22,200
sniffing your fucking tent. It separates
the men from the boys. You know?

3048
02:51:22,740 --> 02:51:23,670
I actually like,

3049
02:51:23,671 --> 02:51:28,290
I like hunting and grizzly
areas because one I like.

3050
02:51:28,320 --> 02:51:30,690
I like that sense of thrill.
And Pat,

3051
02:51:30,810 --> 02:51:35,730
you said grizzly areas meaning the bare
areas that have been around them to camp

3052
02:51:35,731 --> 02:51:37,080
near them? Yeah. Oh Jeez.

3053
02:51:37,110 --> 02:51:40,830
I liked the feeling of being near him
and I also liked that a lot of people

3054
02:51:40,831 --> 02:51:42,870
don't like it and you can,
you tend,

3055
02:51:42,890 --> 02:51:47,370
I think that it has a detectable
effect on competition.

3056
02:51:47,430 --> 02:51:49,590
If I had an iron man suit,
I'll go hunting,

3057
02:51:49,591 --> 02:51:52,290
bear with the iron man suit and
just beat the fuck out of a bear.

3058
02:51:52,680 --> 02:51:56,640
Do you think that's how it, that would
be the ultimate way to fight a bear?

3059
02:51:57,290 --> 02:52:01,050
It was a guy at an iron man. Have you
seen the grizzly project? Oh yeah,

3060
02:52:01,051 --> 02:52:04,590
that's right. He does have some kind
of a crazy tries to make a work.

3061
02:52:05,140 --> 02:52:06,040
He can't get the berries

3062
02:52:06,040 --> 02:52:07,780
to attack them. Yeah.
Oh, that's hilarious.

3063
02:52:08,090 --> 02:52:11,310
They even go out in the woods and like
shoot a horse and waiting for the bears

3064
02:52:11,311 --> 02:52:13,510
to hit it, and he tried to
go up and confront the bears,

3065
02:52:13,511 --> 02:52:14,830
but you could never get
a bear to come at him.

3066
02:52:14,890 --> 02:52:18,880
I lived in Colorado for a while and one
of the things in my town was a bear had

3067
02:52:18,970 --> 02:52:21,610
started breaking into cars
and they were telling people,

3068
02:52:21,611 --> 02:52:24,730
don't leave food in your car or the bear
will go in there and you would think,

3069
02:52:24,731 --> 02:52:27,520
well, the bear is just going to look.
There's no food. He's going to leave. No,

3070
02:52:27,640 --> 02:52:30,820
they eat the inside of your fucking car.
They eat everything.

3071
02:52:31,490 --> 02:52:35,380
They state your fucking dashboard.
Well also, if you have leather seats,

3072
02:52:35,381 --> 02:52:37,300
I bet it probably confuses
the shit out of them.

3073
02:52:37,320 --> 02:52:40,190
You hear of a eating vinyl gas cans.
Oh God,

3074
02:52:40,270 --> 02:52:43,230
I gotta I gotta place in Southeast Alaska
and the neighbor is telling me about a

3075
02:52:43,231 --> 02:52:48,030
bear that broke into a guy shed there
and ate a three gowns of gear oil.

3076
02:52:48,160 --> 02:52:52,350
Well, the lack of fuck, can you
imagine laptop? Fuck. Can you imagine?

3077
02:52:52,590 --> 02:52:56,630
What do you think came out of his
room that came out of your asshole?

3078
02:52:56,850 --> 02:53:01,710
Shit going 75 miles an hour
with high viscosity.

3079
02:53:02,110 --> 02:53:05,140
They'll fucking mobile one commercial.
Hey, by the way, it will we wait,

3080
02:53:05,160 --> 02:53:09,650
we only have a few minutes left. Did you
hear about seadog or moderator that, uh,

3081
02:53:09,660 --> 02:53:12,970
that what happened to him over no.
Thursday? No. What happened? Well,

3082
02:53:12,990 --> 02:53:17,490
I guess unfortunately he's been battling
a lot of depression lately and he's a,

3083
02:53:17,520 --> 02:53:22,110
he did suicide by cop in Glendale and uh,

3084
02:53:22,111 --> 02:53:26,370
I guess, uh, his, his girlfriend or
some females said that, uh, you know,

3085
02:53:26,460 --> 02:53:28,180
he's been trying to kill
himself. He's been, you know,

3086
02:53:28,350 --> 02:53:30,030
over to try and overdose
and drugs and stuff.

3087
02:53:30,180 --> 02:53:32,060
Then the other day something happened,

3088
02:53:32,220 --> 02:53:35,070
so he was like that guy that stood in
the middle of the street in Hollywood,

3089
02:53:35,071 --> 02:53:39,230
shooting at cars, kind of redness.
A friend of you guys. Yeah.

3090
02:53:39,240 --> 02:53:42,220
We hung out with this guy. Yeah. We
hung out with this guy at the, um,

3091
02:53:42,240 --> 02:53:43,980
at the Canyon Club.

3092
02:53:44,040 --> 02:53:46,350
Yeah. And he just got shot by cops. Yeah.

3093
02:53:46,351 --> 02:53:49,500
He lunged towards a cop with a knife.

3094
02:53:50,260 --> 02:53:53,520
And I guess before right before that he
tried to overdose on drugs and you tried

3095
02:53:53,521 --> 02:53:57,870
to come in and stuff where the cop Kellum
yeah, yeah. She was dead. Yeah, he's dead.

3096
02:53:58,130 --> 02:54:02,100
Whoa. Yeah. What do you mean moderator?
He's a moderate or a message board.

3097
02:54:02,101 --> 02:54:05,370
Like he's, he, uh, we have
a message board. It's very,

3098
02:54:05,670 --> 02:54:08,820
it's a huge mess of boards going
like more than 5 million posts on it.

3099
02:54:09,300 --> 02:54:10,450
And this guy was one of the monitoring.

3100
02:54:10,470 --> 02:54:14,130
It's kind of like one of the guys
that lives here more than once.

3101
02:54:14,131 --> 02:54:16,230
We hang out with him more
than once. Yeah. Yeah.

3102
02:54:16,231 --> 02:54:19,260
He was actually gonna I was gonna try and
get him to train my dog. Yeah, he was,

3103
02:54:19,261 --> 02:54:21,810
he wanting to train my dogs too.
When I, when I have those pit bulls,

3104
02:54:21,840 --> 02:54:24,450
he was always trying to tell me
he's going to come over and fix him.

3105
02:54:25,080 --> 02:54:28,260
What'd you have pit bulls for? Um,
I love them. I grow up with them.

3106
02:54:28,290 --> 02:54:29,880
They're just really smart dogs.
You know,

3107
02:54:29,950 --> 02:54:32,490
I'd really became too much of
a pain in the ass. I got older.

3108
02:54:32,700 --> 02:54:35,270
I don't like the dog aggressiveness.
Know I have a massive,

3109
02:54:35,280 --> 02:54:37,560
now is just the opposite. He
doesn't, he never wants to,

3110
02:54:37,590 --> 02:54:40,920
he doesn't hate dog at all. And it mix it
up. If he gets close to dogs, he's like,

3111
02:54:40,921 --> 02:54:44,460
Hey, what's up? You know, he's like,
he's the big silly, but it was just,

3112
02:54:44,461 --> 02:54:47,070
I loved them with people.
They were the most affectionate,

3113
02:54:47,071 --> 02:54:49,990
intelligent dogs of people. It really
make a great connection with them.

3114
02:54:49,991 --> 02:54:51,190
And I grew up with them.

3115
02:54:51,600 --> 02:54:54,300
But the real issue is when you
have them around other dogs,

3116
02:54:54,350 --> 02:54:56,330
they're just too crazy too,
is the,

3117
02:54:56,440 --> 02:55:00,000
the all the years and years
and years of conditioning,

3118
02:55:00,190 --> 02:55:01,860
you can't get it out of their system.

3119
02:55:01,861 --> 02:55:06,260
They've had generation after generation
of calling the dogs that would not fight

3120
02:55:06,261 --> 02:55:08,240
or would quit. You know? So what,

3121
02:55:08,480 --> 02:55:12,230
what it comes out to is survival of the
fittest while they're so smart and quick

3122
02:55:12,231 --> 02:55:15,830
and they're so loyal and they also
kill all the dogs that show any human

3123
02:55:15,831 --> 02:55:19,130
aggression because he's, you know,
when they may breed these dogs to find,

3124
02:55:19,131 --> 02:55:22,160
they would have to be able to get in and
separate them. So if the dog, you know,

3125
02:55:22,161 --> 02:55:25,010
turns on you and bite you,
they would get rid of all those dogs.

3126
02:55:25,040 --> 02:55:27,740
So there were like nonhuman aggressive,

3127
02:55:27,920 --> 02:55:30,630
really intelligent survival
dogs and they're there.

3128
02:55:30,640 --> 02:55:34,160
There's really fucking brilliant animals,
but they're too crazy.

3129
02:55:34,340 --> 02:55:37,730
I think you need to shit to greed of
the wall sits who's a really cute,

3130
02:55:37,760 --> 02:55:39,080
they're all,
they all come from walls,

3131
02:55:39,081 --> 02:55:42,410
which is really fucking crazy and no one
really understands. I know by the way,

3132
02:55:42,411 --> 02:55:43,670
people have sent me a
bunch of things here.

3133
02:55:43,671 --> 02:55:47,120
They explain it how dogs
came from all I've read it.

3134
02:55:47,330 --> 02:55:51,680
It's a lot of fucking guesswork
and patchwork. You can't take,

3135
02:55:51,681 --> 02:55:56,240
you show me one fucking guy ever who's
taken a wolf and turn it into a Chihuahua.

3136
02:55:56,510 --> 02:56:00,560
We show me showing that they can do, they
have done some pretty amazing, not that,

3137
02:56:00,561 --> 02:56:03,860
but when in in trying to explain
how that could have happened.

3138
02:56:03,860 --> 02:56:07,260
They've done some pretty amazing selective
breeding with Fox. Yes, they have.

3139
02:56:07,970 --> 02:56:12,500
I have change it like
dogs 10,000 years ago,

3140
02:56:12,950 --> 02:56:14,960
they did this shit a long time,

3141
02:56:14,961 --> 02:56:18,680
over a period of time that
we have a really almost
difficult time comprehending.

3142
02:56:18,681 --> 02:56:22,010
Yeah, I know, but it's still, I mean
it's amazing that it's been done. I mean,

3143
02:56:22,011 --> 02:56:25,000
I'm not doubting they did call come
from wolves. Absolutely did. I mean,

3144
02:56:25,001 --> 02:56:29,190
I mean I believe at 100% geneticists
have proven all variations on we'll know

3145
02:56:29,191 --> 02:56:31,680
for sure. But it is hard. You
know it's hard. Flash lived.

3146
02:56:31,710 --> 02:56:35,910
You'd wind up with like a,
like a mini poodles are.

3147
02:56:35,960 --> 02:56:37,720
When I say I'm incredulous,
it's not that I'm not,

3148
02:56:37,730 --> 02:56:41,490
maybe it's just like that can't even
wrap my head around the [inaudible] Wolf

3149
02:56:41,570 --> 02:56:46,130
and 12 hug. They turn a wolf into
a fucking French poodle. Like what?

3150
02:56:46,280 --> 02:56:48,890
What, why? Yeah, what the fuck happened?

3151
02:56:49,280 --> 02:56:52,150
If I could wave a magic wand and have
them all go back to wolves, I work.

3152
02:56:52,160 --> 02:56:55,280
Cause it's like it'd be more enjoyable
to have him around. I don't know man.

3153
02:56:55,281 --> 02:56:57,560
It's kind of cool when people have a
little Chihuahua and they keep it in their

3154
02:56:57,561 --> 02:57:00,380
bag and you're like, hey little
buddy. It's nothing wrong with that.

3155
02:57:00,560 --> 02:57:04,310
But it is really a sign of what we
are, you know, we are just like,

3156
02:57:04,610 --> 02:57:06,560
I mean if you wanted to look at people,

3157
02:57:06,561 --> 02:57:08,360
people are the only thing that
would like dogs. You know,

3158
02:57:08,361 --> 02:57:10,610
we vary so much in size
and shape and looks,

3159
02:57:10,611 --> 02:57:14,660
and yet we can breed with each other. You
know, it's really quite strange, dude.

3160
02:57:14,661 --> 02:57:19,661
You are a great spokesman for the idea
of hunting and for an intelligent well

3161
02:57:21,471 --> 02:57:25,640
read person who appreciates it for,
for what it really is. You know?

3162
02:57:25,641 --> 02:57:29,030
And I think your, your stance on is
admirable and your stance against it,

3163
02:57:29,040 --> 02:57:31,310
you know, the high fence
and the, the, you know,

3164
02:57:31,311 --> 02:57:34,750
just the ethics that you have towards it.
It's a lot of people can learn from it.

3165
02:57:34,780 --> 02:57:36,440
I think in a lot of people can learn.

3166
02:57:36,580 --> 02:57:41,090
And it's one of the things that I took
from your show that a, it's not just a,

3167
02:57:41,100 --> 02:57:43,310
you know, being a sportsman, if there's,

3168
02:57:43,311 --> 02:57:46,610
there's discipline to it and that
you benefit from that discipline.

3169
02:57:46,611 --> 02:57:50,030
And what you were talking
about when you're talking
about how when you're in the

3170
02:57:50,031 --> 02:57:52,610
state of hunting that you're
not thinking about anything.

3171
02:57:52,611 --> 02:57:53,840
You're just totally in the group.

3172
02:57:53,930 --> 02:57:57,470
That zen state is what everyone is
looking for in martial arts and in that

3173
02:57:57,471 --> 02:57:59,960
playing pool and it's
doing standup comedy,

3174
02:58:00,080 --> 02:58:03,000
that Zen state of being completely
in the moment, you know,

3175
02:58:03,001 --> 02:58:05,540
and that's chasing that down. Um, and uh,

3176
02:58:05,790 --> 02:58:08,910
I've always been a big supporter
of trying to, you know,

3177
02:58:08,911 --> 02:58:13,410
be self sustainable practice what I
preach and a fucking buy bottled water.

3178
02:58:13,800 --> 02:58:15,770
I would really,
I'd like to pull it off Sunday.

3179
02:58:16,520 --> 02:58:19,140
I like to pull it off and I think
what you're doing is brilliant. So uh,

outdoors on sportsman channel.

3182
02:58:24,451 --> 02:58:25,490
