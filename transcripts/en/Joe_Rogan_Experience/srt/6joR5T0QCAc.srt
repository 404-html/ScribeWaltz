1
00:00:06,090 --> 00:00:10,090
Secondary,
the Joe Rogan experience my day,

2
00:00:10,091 --> 00:00:14,710
Joe Rogan podcast by day.
Ryan Parsons,

3
00:00:14,711 --> 00:00:16,270
my friend.
Good to see you,

4
00:00:16,271 --> 00:00:18,270
brother.
I'm doing well.

5
00:00:18,340 --> 00:00:20,920
Thanks for having me.
Thanks for being on man out there.

6
00:00:20,921 --> 00:00:22,990
Kicking ass,
managing fighters,

7
00:00:23,260 --> 00:00:26,050
getting numb,
the cutting edge of science and training

8
00:00:26,051 --> 00:00:29,350
and nutrition and every time I talked to
you got some new cutting edge type shit.

9
00:00:29,710 --> 00:00:30,580
What it's about,
right?

10
00:00:30,610 --> 00:00:32,290
Yeah.
Today it's an improvement to today.

11
00:00:32,291 --> 00:00:35,380
Ryan came in with these new gloves,
these a radius,

12
00:00:35,710 --> 00:00:40,710
mma gloves that literally you can punch 
a wall with these things on and they 

13
00:00:40,710 --> 00:00:44,701
don't hurt your hands.
I've never experienced anything like 

14
00:00:44,701 --> 00:00:44,701
that.
It's really interesting.

15
00:00:44,701 --> 00:00:47,950
So there's like this red.
That's what this is,

16
00:00:47,951 --> 00:00:52,180
this red hard,
high density foam or closed cell foam.

17
00:00:52,181 --> 00:00:55,240
Now there's three sides of it,
but it started years ago,

18
00:00:55,510 --> 00:00:59,550
a fighter who had a boxers knuckle that 
was so swollen,

19
00:00:59,570 --> 00:01:00,970
inflamed.
If you just tapped it,

20
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:01,960
it would be painful for them.

21
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:04,180
So for a year it affected everything 
that we did.

22
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:09,100
He couldn't hit mid sparring and every 
little bit and we wrapped it with tape,

23
00:01:09,101 --> 00:01:10,960
with gauze,
sponges,

24
00:01:10,961 --> 00:01:14,860
everything we could do to try to figure 
out how to take the pain away because if

25
00:01:14,861 --> 00:01:19,861
you're going to fight,
you have to punch and it continues to 

26
00:01:19,861 --> 00:01:24,121
get irritated.
But I failed and we didn't come up with 

27
00:01:24,121 --> 00:01:24,310
any solution.
And that was the end of it.

28
00:01:24,850 --> 00:01:29,850
Fast forward a couple years,
pet cummings durkin developed the exact 

29
00:01:29,850 --> 00:01:34,081
same,
huge swollen middle knuckle and there's 

30
00:01:34,081 --> 00:01:35,530
a handrail at the UFC,
a cut man,

31
00:01:35,531 --> 00:01:40,531
Rudy.
And he had a different approach to 

32
00:01:40,531 --> 00:01:42,631
wrapping hands and he would place the 
underneath the knuckle,

33
00:01:42,970 --> 00:01:45,760
not on top pads.
The knuckle like this,

34
00:01:46,130 --> 00:01:47,740
you can't really padded enough.
So if,

35
00:01:47,741 --> 00:01:49,060
uh,
if you're punching with the knuckle,

36
00:01:49,061 --> 00:01:52,210
it stresses the bones in your hand or 
your wrist and sometimes your elbow.

37
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:55,030
So he explained that it was,
had the boxing,

38
00:01:55,350 --> 00:02:00,350
the handgrip guys in the sixties and 
seventies in boxing used to wrap where 

39
00:02:00,350 --> 00:02:00,350
you put the,
the,

40
00:02:00,350 --> 00:02:03,100
um,
the pad on the bottom of the knuckles.

41
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:08,800
And if you put your fingers like this,
there's a natural flex that's involved 

42
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:10,360
with your hands and it saves punching 
here and decreases the stress here.

43
00:02:10,810 --> 00:02:15,810
So instead of putting it over the Naco,
if you're like looking at a fist coming 

44
00:02:15,810 --> 00:02:16,990
your way,
you would put it below.

45
00:02:16,991 --> 00:02:18,580
So for folks who are just listening to 
this,

46
00:02:18,820 --> 00:02:21,240
you would just put it below the bumps of
the knuckle,

47
00:02:21,260 --> 00:02:23,770
the brush where the bone sticks out.
Correct.

48
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:28,800
And this,
is this something you developed 

49
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:28,800
yourself?
I watched him do that now here,

50
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:33,690
take this.
And I was reaching for his thing and I'm

51
00:02:35,490 --> 00:02:40,490
knocked over my coffee.
I've done this a hundred times on a 

52
00:02:40,490 --> 00:02:40,490
show.

53
00:02:40,490 --> 00:02:42,340
That's all right.
No electronics were damaged.

54
00:02:42,490 --> 00:02:45,010
So yeah.
So anyways,

55
00:02:45,011 --> 00:02:50,011
the,
I kinda saw that he was doing with the 

56
00:02:50,011 --> 00:02:52,291
guys and we played around with it and 
the experience with um,

57
00:02:52,930 --> 00:02:57,930
the fighter a few years ago.
And then with pat it was something that 

58
00:02:57,930 --> 00:02:57,930
was really affecting our day to day 
life.

59
00:02:57,930 --> 00:03:02,790
So we kind of took that concept and 
expanded upon it and we tested so many 

60
00:03:02,790 --> 00:03:05,830
different styles of foam shapes,
densities,

61
00:03:06,070 --> 00:03:11,070
and we ended up with this and I made a 
prototype at home and pat started using.

62
00:03:11,801 --> 00:03:13,810
We'd walk around my kitchen with their 
hands wrapped,

63
00:03:14,110 --> 00:03:17,290
punching the granite countertops and no 
boy,

64
00:03:17,291 --> 00:03:19,240
there's something here,
I don't know what it is,

65
00:03:19,241 --> 00:03:22,000
but this really works.
And Pat started to use them in training.

66
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:27,560
I didn't pay attention for a couple 
weeks and I saw that every day he was 

67
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:27,560
washing the same handwriting.
I said,

68
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:32,280
should we get you some new handed 
because none of the other ones don't 

69
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:32,280
work.

70
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:35,520
This is the one I like.
And that kind of was our little light 

71
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:35,520
bulb moment right there.
It said,

72
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:37,150
we've got to figure out what's going on 
here.

73
00:03:37,180 --> 00:03:39,950
So what are those?
When a boxer gets that knuckle,

74
00:03:39,951 --> 00:03:40,810
like boxers,
Michael,

75
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:44,440
what is that?
It's just a terribly irritated.

76
00:03:44,470 --> 00:03:47,320
The tendon,
when the attending can get torn,

77
00:03:47,321 --> 00:03:50,800
all the soft tissues around it,
the joint capsule gets what's swelled up

78
00:03:50,801 --> 00:03:54,910
and your knuckle hurts your whole hand 
or to decrease his grip strength.

79
00:03:54,950 --> 00:03:57,430
So especially in Emma,
where grips so important,

80
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,040
all of a sudden now you can't squeeze 
like you can.

81
00:04:00,041 --> 00:04:05,041
You're grappling goes mean.
There's really longterm implications of 

82
00:04:05,041 --> 00:04:06,580
that and a lot of times these are 
problems that plague fighters for years.

83
00:04:06,670 --> 00:04:11,670
What do you think about this idea?
I've been throwing this around a lot 

84
00:04:11,670 --> 00:04:15,331
lately.
I think that it might be better for 

85
00:04:15,331 --> 00:04:16,600
everybody if there was no gloves.

86
00:04:19,450 --> 00:04:22,150
Well you'll have less knockouts,
less knockout.

87
00:04:22,470 --> 00:04:24,940
It was brain damage.
You have less hand damage,

88
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:27,030
I might say.
You have more hand damaging.

89
00:04:27,031 --> 00:04:27,940
So yeah,
for sure.

90
00:04:27,941 --> 00:04:29,380
Because gloves protect,
right?

91
00:04:29,980 --> 00:04:32,080
So you'll have,
you'll have less brain damage,

92
00:04:32,081 --> 00:04:33,880
less gets initially,
right?

93
00:04:33,881 --> 00:04:38,881
But wouldn't everybody like sort of 
figure out what you can and can't get 

94
00:04:38,881 --> 00:04:40,620
away with when it comes to punching?
You can't just fucking whale away.

95
00:04:40,621 --> 00:04:44,440
You have to be more precise in your,
your implementation of strikes.

96
00:04:44,441 --> 00:04:47,650
I guess in theory that's true.
But you get in the middle of a fight and

97
00:04:47,651 --> 00:04:50,020
this happens all the time and training 
paths.

98
00:04:50,021 --> 00:04:55,021
Boxers,
knuckled didn't come initially from 

99
00:04:55,021 --> 00:04:55,021
hitting,
hitting pads.

100
00:04:55,021 --> 00:04:57,250
It came from an Emma mma glove and he 
came into scramble situation,

101
00:04:57,251 --> 00:05:02,251
hit someone in the head,
the heart part of their head and his 

102
00:05:02,251 --> 00:05:04,921
knuckles swelled up,
so you're going to get in the scramble 

103
00:05:04,921 --> 00:05:04,921
situations,
especially in Emma,

104
00:05:04,921 --> 00:05:08,740
Emma,
that you're going to catch someone 

105
00:05:08,740 --> 00:05:11,551
funny,
but don't you think that maybe there 

106
00:05:11,551 --> 00:05:14,171
will be less leg breaks like we're 
seeing with like Anderson Silva and 

107
00:05:14,171 --> 00:05:17,140
tyrone spong if they were Shin pads for 
sure,

108
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:19,900
and we have more protection is going to 
be more protection.

109
00:05:19,900 --> 00:05:21,100
There's going to be less injuries with 
that,

110
00:05:21,101 --> 00:05:22,630
but you have,
but no one's going to accept that.

111
00:05:22,631 --> 00:05:23,860
Right?
You can't go back.

112
00:05:24,210 --> 00:05:25,820
No one's going to say like,
you know,

113
00:05:25,821 --> 00:05:27,990
if you start patting people shinzen,
people are going to go,

114
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,670
come on.
What are we doing visually?

115
00:05:30,671 --> 00:05:31,720
The fans are gonna,
hate it,

116
00:05:31,721 --> 00:05:35,440
and also padding your shins or some 
trouble with grappling with that.

117
00:05:35,470 --> 00:05:37,690
It's hard to grapple with with 
shinguards,

118
00:05:37,700 --> 00:05:39,920
which brings me back to the gloves.
It's hard to sink in.

119
00:05:39,921 --> 00:05:44,921
Chokes.
It's hard to think in chokes those 

120
00:05:44,921 --> 00:05:44,921
gloves like rear nakeds and things along
those lines.

121
00:05:44,921 --> 00:05:47,230
It's hard to for sure,
to lock up the correct hand position.

122
00:05:47,670 --> 00:05:52,670
Teens are tougher to get.
There's a bunch of things that are 

123
00:05:52,670 --> 00:05:52,670
tougher to secure your hand.
Your hand grips true.

124
00:05:52,670 --> 00:05:53,610
It's a tradeoff.
Nana maybe right?

125
00:05:53,611 --> 00:05:56,590
There's a constant we give and take in 
this sport,

126
00:05:56,591 --> 00:05:57,980
but it seems to me that

127
00:05:57,980 --> 00:06:02,980
if you can hit someone with a raw elbow,
Rodney Roshan Rauf foot raw heal,

128
00:06:04,220 --> 00:06:07,370
you can heal someone in the head Aka,
you know,

129
00:06:07,380 --> 00:06:09,080
ah,
Edson Barboza,

130
00:06:09,110 --> 00:06:14,110
Terry Adam,
which is one of the worst knockouts 

131
00:06:14,110 --> 00:06:14,110
ever.
Uh,

132
00:06:14,110 --> 00:06:15,660
we'll kick to the head the amount of 
fucking force you generate.

133
00:06:15,661 --> 00:06:18,910
It's just insane.
But no,

134
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:20,460
no padding at all.
I mean,

135
00:06:20,570 --> 00:06:25,570
literally these pads are protecting the 
hand more than they're protecting the 

136
00:06:25,641 --> 00:06:26,900
fighter from damage,
right?

137
00:06:26,930 --> 00:06:27,810
Sure.
For sure.

138
00:06:27,811 --> 00:06:28,740
Right?
Definitely.

139
00:06:28,850 --> 00:06:30,980
So if that's the case,
he's not like a,

140
00:06:31,490 --> 00:06:34,530
an almost like an a crutch for the 
striker,

141
00:06:34,531 --> 00:06:36,230
for the,
for the person who's actually delivering

142
00:06:36,231 --> 00:06:38,390
the shots,
you're giving them an unfair advantage.

143
00:06:38,630 --> 00:06:43,630
You're taping the wrist top and an 
unnatural way because it's part of 

144
00:06:43,630 --> 00:06:43,630
punching things.
Your risk buckle,

145
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:45,530
like you have to learn how to punch 
correctly.

146
00:06:45,531 --> 00:06:50,531
And you have to be much more diligent 
about the placement of your punches 

147
00:06:50,531 --> 00:06:53,890
because when you hit things,
if you've ever seen like a slow motion 

148
00:06:53,890 --> 00:06:53,890
video of someone hitting something with 
a bare knuckle,

149
00:06:53,890 --> 00:06:56,450
your fucking risk just gives our Nah,
it's a joint.

150
00:06:56,780 --> 00:06:58,700
It's hard to keep stiff,
you know?

151
00:06:58,701 --> 00:07:03,701
And I think,
I think we have an unrealistic 

152
00:07:03,701 --> 00:07:06,191
perception of striking because of the 
fact that guys wear gloves and tape 

153
00:07:06,191 --> 00:07:07,730
wraps and all that jazz.
I think it's unrealistic.

154
00:07:07,850 --> 00:07:10,930
It definitely changes things for sure.
Yeah.

155
00:07:10,940 --> 00:07:15,940
I think.
I think there could be an argument for 

156
00:07:15,940 --> 00:07:18,371
it and I think it would probably save a 
lot of shots that guys eat.

157
00:07:19,401 --> 00:07:21,500
You know,
I think the overall,

158
00:07:21,501 --> 00:07:26,501
like over the course of your career,
I think it would be significantly less 

159
00:07:26,501 --> 00:07:26,501
impacts,

160
00:07:26,501 --> 00:07:29,570
but a lot of that cumulative traumas is 
training based to.

161
00:07:29,571 --> 00:07:30,320
Yeah.
Yeah.

162
00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:32,980
So these,
we,

163
00:07:33,060 --> 00:07:37,670
we knew they worked and so we teamed up 
with a sport science lab at Uc Fullerton

164
00:07:38,230 --> 00:07:41,300
and got a real phd pumping out real 
research and said,

165
00:07:41,870 --> 00:07:46,870
listen,
we can punch our granite countertops 

166
00:07:46,870 --> 00:07:48,701
with these.
Tell us if we're imagining this or it 

167
00:07:48,701 --> 00:07:48,701
really works.
So he did a,

168
00:07:48,701 --> 00:07:50,670
the first of a series of,
of uh,

169
00:07:50,700 --> 00:07:53,780
academic studies on,
on this approach to it,

170
00:07:53,870 --> 00:07:56,870
and found a couple of things that they 
reduce impact dramatically.

171
00:07:56,871 --> 00:07:58,520
And the white,
one of the ways they first tested it,

172
00:07:58,521 --> 00:08:03,521
they took a,
an 18 to 35 and 50 pound Kettlebell and 

173
00:08:03,521 --> 00:08:04,700
they did a rap on the Kettlebell with 
this approach.

174
00:08:04,701 --> 00:08:06,500
And then drop it.
We bought this special,

175
00:08:06,770 --> 00:08:09,590
it's called a strike,
make pet measures impact forces.

176
00:08:09,620 --> 00:08:11,720
And it was scientifically calibrates.
We know,

177
00:08:12,290 --> 00:08:13,340
okay,
this thing works.

178
00:08:13,730 --> 00:08:18,730
And they did repeated thousands of drops
on this and they measured it and it was 

179
00:08:19,470 --> 00:08:24,470
like,
I can't give the number and tell for 

180
00:08:24,470 --> 00:08:24,470
some reason until this study is 
published.

181
00:08:24,470 --> 00:08:27,710
But it was a tremendous decrease.
Even with a 50 pound Kettlebell,

182
00:08:27,711 --> 00:08:30,740
it decreased the force of that 
Kettlebell onto the pad.

183
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:35,540
So the issue with brain trauma is not 
just the impact,

184
00:08:35,541 --> 00:08:38,060
but the amount that it forces the head 
back,

185
00:08:38,061 --> 00:08:39,230
right?
The snap of the head.

186
00:08:39,330 --> 00:08:40,830
That's an issue of it to you.
You get here,

187
00:08:40,831 --> 00:08:43,770
your brain slams into the back of your 
head and then comes back again.

188
00:08:43,950 --> 00:08:46,690
Do you think that that would be reduced?
I don't that.

189
00:08:46,691 --> 00:08:51,691
I don't think it's going to change,
but you're going to have more 

190
00:08:51,691 --> 00:08:54,891
absorption,
so you have to look at a couple of 

191
00:08:54,891 --> 00:08:54,891
things.
It's the basic physics equation.

192
00:08:54,891 --> 00:08:55,920
The force of something equals the mass.
How big it is times acceleration,

193
00:08:55,921 --> 00:08:56,040
how

194
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:58,770
fast it's moving this way is a couple of
grams,

195
00:08:58,771 --> 00:09:00,880
so it doesn't increase the mass at all.
Right there.

196
00:09:00,890 --> 00:09:03,360
You have a big thick pad,
but it's still four ounces.

197
00:09:03,610 --> 00:09:06,450
Just like an MMA glove that you compete,
I think.

198
00:09:06,451 --> 00:09:06,900
Uh,
yeah.

199
00:09:06,901 --> 00:09:08,560
I think our gloves way,
4.5

200
00:09:08,561 --> 00:09:09,840
ounces,
these wraps,

201
00:09:10,020 --> 00:09:13,110
they're very standard hundred daily and 
traps as well.

202
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:18,520
Um,
but the pad itself doesn't mean you can 

203
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:18,520
feel it doesn't play anything.
Yeah,

204
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:20,330
it's amazing.
This is like,

205
00:09:20,340 --> 00:09:25,340
they keep coming up with new material in
or new ways to formulate material that 

206
00:09:25,951 --> 00:09:28,410
makes for things like this.
This is fascinating to me.

207
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:30,420
That's a closed cell foam.
So there's,

208
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:32,520
I mean you can put it in the Washer and 
dryer,

209
00:09:32,521 --> 00:09:33,380
it doesn't get.
Yeah,

210
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:38,790
bacteria can't grow anything like that.
So w we tested it and we also found that

211
00:09:38,791 --> 00:09:41,550
it reduces,
if you punch being you're wearing that,

212
00:09:41,551 --> 00:09:43,530
it's less forced to my brain as well.

213
00:09:43,980 --> 00:09:46,300
And the reason why that is another 
equation,

214
00:09:46,301 --> 00:09:49,980
you have to look at it as the pressure.
So if you throw a punch and a slap,

215
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:55,160
the force is exactly the same.
If it's the same arc and the same 

216
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:58,311
strike.
The difference why it punches more 

217
00:09:58,311 --> 00:10:01,041
devastating is because that,
that force is condensed into a smaller 

218
00:10:01,041 --> 00:10:01,170
area,
on a punch with a slap.

219
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:06,440
It's spread out over a wider area.
So if you could fish slapped by someone 

220
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:06,440
with a little hand,
it probably hurts more.

221
00:10:07,170 --> 00:10:09,020
Now I'm going to assume that fucking 
room,

222
00:10:11,030 --> 00:10:16,030
that's why it hurts more when girls 
bitch slap you because it hurts your 

223
00:10:16,030 --> 00:10:16,030
pride to.
There you go.

224
00:10:16,620 --> 00:10:18,960
So this,
this approach,

225
00:10:19,380 --> 00:10:21,070
um,
do you think that this is.

226
00:10:21,540 --> 00:10:23,880
The problem with it in competition is 
they're too,

227
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,130
they're too big.
It's a train in glove competitions,

228
00:10:26,131 --> 00:10:27,810
all different.
But most people don't compete,

229
00:10:28,050 --> 00:10:31,230
but these are not that much bigger than 
the ones that were in pride.

230
00:10:31,530 --> 00:10:33,520
Like the problems are pretty good at 
all.

231
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:37,530
That it also makes it more difficult to 
extend your fingers.

232
00:10:37,531 --> 00:10:40,080
So we'll help with ipos.
Oh yeah,

233
00:10:40,081 --> 00:10:41,520
that's right.
That's a big one man.

234
00:10:41,521 --> 00:10:45,150
And that was another thing that pride to
dress better than the UFC because it was

235
00:10:45,151 --> 00:10:47,220
very rarely were there.
I pokes and pride.

236
00:10:47,830 --> 00:10:52,830
I've been really kind of studying this I
poke thing a lot over the past few 

237
00:10:52,830 --> 00:10:53,940
years.
It's that,

238
00:10:54,180 --> 00:10:55,260
you know,
that old cliche,

239
00:10:55,261 --> 00:11:00,261
the definition of insanity is doing 
something over and over again the exact 

240
00:11:00,261 --> 00:11:00,261
same way.
Hoping for different result.

241
00:11:00,261 --> 00:11:01,860
That's sort of what we're doing with 
this ipad thing.

242
00:11:01,890 --> 00:11:03,780
Yeah,
I mean every goddamn fight there's like,

243
00:11:03,781 --> 00:11:06,480
look at the last Aldo Mendez fight was 
like two,

244
00:11:06,690 --> 00:11:11,370
at least two ipos right there where they
stop the action back off.

245
00:11:11,371 --> 00:11:16,371
Like that's crazy that,
that to me it's crazy that you're high 

246
00:11:16,371 --> 00:11:16,860
level competition guys.

247
00:11:16,860 --> 00:11:21,860
Not Cheating,
it's just they're just doing what 

248
00:11:21,860 --> 00:11:22,970
happens in a fight normally in guys are 
getting poked in the eye.

249
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:28,040
I mean,
how many more guys have to get like a 

250
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:30,080
Michael Bisping type injury where 
Michael Bisping has one crazy fucking 

251
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:30,570
lie.
He trains with us now.

252
00:11:30,870 --> 00:11:31,710
Does he?
Yeah,

253
00:11:32,220 --> 00:11:34,260
he's high.
That one eye is not good.

254
00:11:35,190 --> 00:11:37,350
Yeah.
Doesn't seem to affect them in train,

255
00:11:37,351 --> 00:11:39,150
but it looks a little funny.
He's a fucking animal.

256
00:11:39,540 --> 00:11:41,340
Michael Bisping is just.
I have say,

257
00:11:41,380 --> 00:11:45,120
I have never met anyone who wants to win
more than Michael Bisping.

258
00:11:45,210 --> 00:11:47,760
He's a fucking animal.
He wants to win every training session.

259
00:11:47,761 --> 00:11:49,440
Every go,
every situation.

260
00:11:49,441 --> 00:11:54,441
That guy is a winner.
He's a fucking animal and he doesn't 

261
00:11:54,441 --> 00:11:57,910
have like a extreme athletic talent or 
extreme physical gifts.

262
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:03,240
It's just cardiovascular training.
Discipline will toughness.

263
00:12:04,210 --> 00:12:09,210
He's got all these other things,
but like you look at a guy like Jon 

264
00:12:09,210 --> 00:12:09,670
Jones,
just incredible physical talent.

265
00:12:09,940 --> 00:12:14,940
You know,
you look at a guy like I'm Hector 

266
00:12:14,940 --> 00:12:15,520
Lombard,
ridiculous physical talent on top of the

267
00:12:15,521 --> 00:12:16,450
discipline,
all that stuff.

268
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:21,670
Bisbing just a normal guy,
a normal guy who's tough as shit.

269
00:12:22,060 --> 00:12:24,520
Tough as shit.
He doesn't get enough credit.

270
00:12:24,730 --> 00:12:26,440
I really don't think he gets nearly 
enough credit.

271
00:12:27,630 --> 00:12:30,240
The guys,
these last two have been very juice hop,

272
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:31,350
top high level guy.
Well,

273
00:12:31,380 --> 00:12:35,110
I mean I'd probably.
Tim Kennedy.

274
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:37,270
Yeah.
Tim Kennedy was a clean,

275
00:12:37,300 --> 00:12:42,300
clean as a whistle,
but everybody else essentially was on 

276
00:12:42,300 --> 00:12:42,300
something that you can't do anymore.
I don't know.

277
00:12:42,300 --> 00:12:45,430
What I like about him is grit and 
they've found that grit is a much better

278
00:12:45,431 --> 00:12:50,431
predictor of success than I queue is,
so when you find someone who really 

279
00:12:50,651 --> 00:12:55,651
wants something and they're willing to 
suffer and keep going and fail and get 

280
00:12:55,651 --> 00:12:59,791
up again and fail and get up again,
that's the guy that you got to put your 

281
00:12:59,791 --> 00:13:00,100
money on visiting does that better than 
anyone.

282
00:13:00,430 --> 00:13:05,430
He certainly does,
but it him against a guy like Anderson 

283
00:13:05,430 --> 00:13:07,120
Silva and his prime.
You know that,

284
00:13:07,330 --> 00:13:12,330
that that's like this crossover,
this like we're the land of grit meets 

285
00:13:12,610 --> 00:13:17,610
extreme talent and confidence and just 
that rare quality that the goats possess

286
00:13:20,050 --> 00:13:22,260
the greatest of all times.
Guys that,

287
00:13:22,330 --> 00:13:26,710
that rare thing that Anderson had for a 
few years in his prime.

288
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:30,550
It seems like Weidman's kind of stolen 
that from him pretty.

289
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:33,940
Which is a shame too,
because he was so dominant for so long.

290
00:13:34,150 --> 00:13:36,130
No shame.
Beautiful.

291
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:37,590
It's the way.
I don't mean that.

292
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:42,600
I mean if,
if people don't think as highly of 

293
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:44,050
Anderson Silva because he lost and that 
would be a shame.

294
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:45,730
I don't see that.
I don't see that.

295
00:13:45,731 --> 00:13:46,870
It's just,
you know,

296
00:13:46,871 --> 00:13:49,510
Weidman was the right guy at the right 
time.

297
00:13:49,511 --> 00:13:51,430
And that's the beautiful thing about the
sport.

298
00:13:51,431 --> 00:13:52,180
It's,
you know,

299
00:13:52,210 --> 00:13:55,770
new guys come along and then Weidman 
becomes that guy and Weidman,

300
00:13:55,780 --> 00:13:56,950
you know,
he'd beat Leo.

301
00:13:56,950 --> 00:13:57,990
Machida,
he's,

302
00:13:58,040 --> 00:14:00,700
he's a fucking savage man at 
[inaudible].

303
00:14:00,730 --> 00:14:05,730
That guy's a tank.
He just a goddamn iron willed steel 

304
00:14:05,730 --> 00:14:10,030
jawed knockout machine.
That's a fucking high caliber for time.

305
00:14:10,031 --> 00:14:15,031
Division One,
all American wrestler that wants to 

306
00:14:15,031 --> 00:14:16,240
steal your soul once again on top of you
and punch through your fucking your bone

307
00:14:16,241 --> 00:14:19,630
structure until he get out your soul.
Just Yank it out of your body.

308
00:14:19,631 --> 00:14:24,631
And when.
And there's always going to be those 

309
00:14:24,631 --> 00:14:24,631
guys,
you know,

310
00:14:24,631 --> 00:14:27,820
like a nature documentary that the big 
male lion at some point is driven off 

311
00:14:27,820 --> 00:14:28,480
of.
Someone new comes along.

312
00:14:28,481 --> 00:14:30,020
It's going to happen.
You know,

313
00:14:30,021 --> 00:14:34,000
Anderson's 39 now and he just signed a 
15 fight deal.

314
00:14:34,590 --> 00:14:37,180
Yeah.
How crazy is he at 39?

315
00:14:37,230 --> 00:14:38,650
He's like,
just for fun.

316
00:14:39,370 --> 00:14:41,590
I don't know,
maybe he's going to do all 15 fights.

317
00:14:41,591 --> 00:14:43,330
I mean he would have to do,
but it's.

318
00:14:43,331 --> 00:14:45,070
So Ronnie probably fights the most of 
anybody,

319
00:14:45,071 --> 00:14:45,370
right?

320
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:47,080
Probably fights about five times a year.
I think.

321
00:14:47,081 --> 00:14:49,630
Neil magnifique six times last year.
Did he really?

322
00:14:49,690 --> 00:14:50,500
Yeah.
Yeah.

323
00:14:50,501 --> 00:14:53,200
Neil's I started was trying to fight a 
six time.

324
00:14:53,990 --> 00:14:55,850
Maybe you're right.
So let's say six times.

325
00:14:55,890 --> 00:14:57,230
Probably the most.
That's pretty extreme.

326
00:14:57,231 --> 00:15:00,110
Every two months.
That's the most anybody does,

327
00:15:00,111 --> 00:15:01,660
right?
Pretty much for a headliner there.

328
00:15:01,670 --> 00:15:06,670
You gotta figure it's every year,
maybe three times a year if you're 

329
00:15:06,670 --> 00:15:06,670
really lucky.
So if he.

330
00:15:06,670 --> 00:15:07,040
Yeah,
that's true.

331
00:15:07,041 --> 00:15:08,300
Right?
Because you've got to sell it.

332
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:10,430
It's not only magnesium.
The undercard is like,

333
00:15:10,431 --> 00:15:12,530
people look forward to seeing them fight
good fighter,

334
00:15:12,890 --> 00:15:16,670
but it's not like people are like 
shelling out pay per view dollars to see

335
00:15:16,671 --> 00:15:20,450
a guy who's relatively unknown except 
regards hardcore guys like you or me who

336
00:15:20,451 --> 00:15:25,451
really know about it,
but a guy like Anderson selling pay per 

337
00:15:25,451 --> 00:15:25,451
view,
selling cards,

338
00:15:25,451 --> 00:15:30,070
headline Fox,
he probably can't fight but three times 

339
00:15:30,070 --> 00:15:32,201
a year Max realty especially talking 
about age and then preparation.

340
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:37,840
It's going to take him three months to 
prepare because that's how he's used to 

341
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:42,120
been doing.
If you're young and you're just getting 

342
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:42,120
started,
you can go fight more,

343
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:45,251
but once you get older you kind of need 
that time and then you've had that 

344
00:15:45,251 --> 00:15:48,551
experience of longer fight camps and 
better preparation and so what do you 

345
00:15:48,551 --> 00:15:50,510
think the 15 fight deal just to keep 
them from going to bell door.

346
00:15:51,660 --> 00:15:54,020
I would imagine that was on Anderson's 
end.

347
00:15:54,021 --> 00:15:59,021
I don't know,
but I wonder because he had a deal and 

348
00:15:59,021 --> 00:16:01,210
then when they were back in Rio for this
past UFC,

349
00:16:01,220 --> 00:16:02,990
although Mendez fight,
they resigned them.

350
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:06,740
They throw out the old deal,
resigned them to 15 fight deal.

351
00:16:07,190 --> 00:16:09,910
He's done everything there is to deal 
helping assist with I.

352
00:16:09,910 --> 00:16:12,920
He's one of the greatest ever.
He was the greatest ever,

353
00:16:12,970 --> 00:16:16,670
I think for sure,
but the argument can be made,

354
00:16:16,671 --> 00:16:17,900
especially now that he's lost.

355
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:23,320
The argument can be made for fader.
Those the only two guys I think that 

356
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:25,940
fall into the greatest ever faders tough
thing is he never fought in the UFC.

357
00:16:26,550 --> 00:16:28,640
That's,
that's the one strike against them.

358
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:32,690
Also,
the way he lost two big foot and the way

359
00:16:32,691 --> 00:16:37,130
he lost his doom.
It's like an Henderson Henderson.

360
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:38,930
Yeah,
that's a big one too,

361
00:16:38,931 --> 00:16:43,931
man.
He was kind of a different guy by that 

362
00:16:43,931 --> 00:16:43,931
time though,
you know,

363
00:16:43,931 --> 00:16:44,780
I think you'd already sort of checked 
out.

364
00:16:45,110 --> 00:16:50,110
His body looked way different,
like go back and watch the Food G to 

365
00:16:50,110 --> 00:16:50,510
fight.
When he fought Fujita,

366
00:16:50,540 --> 00:16:53,030
who's fucking rocked?
It was swole.

367
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:55,100
He still had that big Russian beer 
belly,

368
00:16:55,510 --> 00:16:58,340
but he was swole.
He was a big thick.

369
00:16:58,940 --> 00:17:01,070
We shared locker rooms with him and 
pride before.

370
00:17:01,190 --> 00:17:02,120
Oh really?
Yeah.

371
00:17:02,900 --> 00:17:04,070
How does he prepare?
What does he want?

372
00:17:04,080 --> 00:17:05,120
What's his warm up like?

373
00:17:05,780 --> 00:17:09,470
They're always pretty mellow.
I have watched the warm up with him.

374
00:17:09,471 --> 00:17:11,540
We were always,
for whatever reason,

375
00:17:11,541 --> 00:17:16,541
it didn't turn out like that,
but sometimes you pay attention to the 

376
00:17:16,541 --> 00:17:19,451
warm up.
Sometimes you'd done just depends where 

377
00:17:19,451 --> 00:17:21,021
you fall in the card.
One of the things that I really love 

378
00:17:21,021 --> 00:17:23,621
about BMA is that there's guys like you 
that are out there that really aren't 

379
00:17:24,170 --> 00:17:26,540
almost forced to innovate.
Yeah.

380
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:27,710
Yeah.
It's like,

381
00:17:27,711 --> 00:17:32,711
this is not a sport like football or 
basketball where there's established 

382
00:17:32,931 --> 00:17:37,931
training protocols and everybody sort of
knows the exact right way to go about 

383
00:17:37,931 --> 00:17:37,931
doing things.
No,

384
00:17:37,931 --> 00:17:39,680
it's like guys like you who are going,
oh,

385
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:44,760
what if there was no training protocols,
so they had to be started.

386
00:17:45,750 --> 00:17:50,750
Some someone,
I think they thought they were insulted 

387
00:17:50,750 --> 00:17:50,750
me when it said Ryan is always trying to
make everything better.

388
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:53,760
Exactly.
That's exactly it.

389
00:17:54,330 --> 00:17:55,790
That's the greatest compliment.
You're in.

390
00:17:55,791 --> 00:18:00,791
Salt was a great compliment.
When people think that for some reason 

391
00:18:00,791 --> 00:18:01,170
everything's fine.
He just work hard.

392
00:18:01,290 --> 00:18:03,150
Everything is fine,
but no,

393
00:18:03,151 --> 00:18:03,610
there's,
there's,

394
00:18:03,660 --> 00:18:06,690
there's all sorts of ways to do things 
the right way.

395
00:18:06,950 --> 00:18:11,160
Will w I wrote the first team quest 
training manual 14 years ago,

396
00:18:11,670 --> 00:18:16,670
so it's been a long time thinking about 
the progress and how you train for 

397
00:18:16,670 --> 00:18:20,001
sports now,
there's been an evolution of the 

398
00:18:20,001 --> 00:18:21,501
technical side of things.
In the beginning technique you had to 

399
00:18:21,501 --> 00:18:25,641
know the technique.
If you had never seen an arm bar before 

400
00:18:25,641 --> 00:18:26,790
or didn't hide to a double leg,
the what became very important.

401
00:18:26,850 --> 00:18:27,730
What W,
W,

402
00:18:27,750 --> 00:18:29,760
what techniques do I feel?
How do you defend this?

403
00:18:29,761 --> 00:18:31,830
If you don't know,
then all of a sudden,

404
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:33,840
you know,
I met Art Jimson the other day.

405
00:18:34,020 --> 00:18:36,590
I met rob.
I met art at one of the recent UFC.

406
00:18:36,670 --> 00:18:38,570
He seemed with his glove.
He brought that one.

407
00:18:39,300 --> 00:18:41,370
He gave me a glove and that's really 
nice guy,

408
00:18:41,610 --> 00:18:45,180
but he just had never even seen.
If you don't know that that can exist,

409
00:18:45,181 --> 00:18:48,480
you have to figure out the what now,
the what is everywhere.

410
00:18:48,481 --> 00:18:53,481
I can have Marcella Garcia teach me how 
to choke someone on Youtube in two 

411
00:18:53,481 --> 00:18:53,820
minutes and does this cost me any money?
Right?

412
00:18:53,821 --> 00:18:54,410
Right.
If I want,

413
00:18:54,420 --> 00:18:59,420
I can save up a little bit of money.
I can go to New York and I can probably 

414
00:18:59,420 --> 00:18:59,420
do a private with him for,
I don't know,

415
00:18:59,420 --> 00:19:00,450
couple hundred bucks or something like 
that.

416
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:01,530
Whatever it is,
whatever it is,

417
00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:03,600
you know,
and there's so many people,

418
00:19:03,601 --> 00:19:06,150
there's so many people who can teach me 
how to have a box,

419
00:19:06,151 --> 00:19:09,540
how to kickbox everything.
So the what isn't important anymore.

420
00:19:09,541 --> 00:19:12,630
Now it's why.
Why are you doing what you're doing?

421
00:19:13,530 --> 00:19:16,470
So that's what I spend most of my 
timeline.

422
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:21,500
We've changed the nature of how we 
structure training camps and nature of 

423
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:24,740
how we train for each fight has to 
adjust and change a little bit because 

424
00:19:24,740 --> 00:19:26,280
every fight is different.
You know where the what is still sort of

425
00:19:26,281 --> 00:19:31,281
like ambiguous or missing is in 
traditional karate techniques or 

426
00:19:31,281 --> 00:19:35,630
traditional taekwondo techniques.
Like a lot of people are doing a lot of 

427
00:19:35,630 --> 00:19:38,811
those wrong.
Still like high level guys still throw 

428
00:19:38,811 --> 00:19:39,750
bad spinning back ticks.
They still throw bad.

429
00:19:39,751 --> 00:19:44,751
We'll kicks like high level guys,
but then some guys pick it up while 

430
00:19:44,751 --> 00:19:48,490
you're [inaudible] fucking 37 years old.
All of a sudden he's got a we'll kick 

431
00:19:48,490 --> 00:19:49,890
out of nowhere.
We fight rockhold.

432
00:19:49,891 --> 00:19:50,990
He hits him in the head with a we'll 
kick.

433
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:53,610
It's never even fucking thrown a.
we'll check before he throws one.

434
00:19:53,611 --> 00:19:57,780
We'll kick earlier in that round misses 
and then throws the second one,

435
00:19:58,140 --> 00:20:02,220
clocks rockhold and finishes them off 
from the ground like what the fuck.

436
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:06,570
And you know where a lot of detours 
kicking is coming from brittle hands.

437
00:20:07,310 --> 00:20:12,310
You a lot of his kickings coming from VV
tours had more than seven surgeries on 

438
00:20:12,310 --> 00:20:14,220
his hands.
He's always breaking his hands.

439
00:20:14,430 --> 00:20:18,120
So he started to.
He's like forced himself.

440
00:20:18,450 --> 00:20:23,450
Like when he fought Jon Jones,
he had a fucked up hand going into that 

441
00:20:23,450 --> 00:20:23,450
fight.
You know,

442
00:20:23,450 --> 00:20:28,170
I,
I'd spoken with him in Brazil just maybe

443
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:31,770
a few months before that and he had a 
pin in his hand.

444
00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:36,600
So a few months before fighting for the 
light heavyweight title against arguably

445
00:20:36,601 --> 00:20:39,270
the greatest light heavyweight ever.
He's got a fucking broken hand,

446
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:42,900
you know,
so he started developing his kicks a lot

447
00:20:42,901 --> 00:20:47,901
more and that's where you started 
knocked out being with a head kick 

448
00:20:47,901 --> 00:20:48,100
fucked up.
Henderson with the head kicks,

449
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:51,250
head kicks were not a part of his 
repertoire in the early days.

450
00:20:51,460 --> 00:20:56,460
It was all wide stance.
Stand your ground floor blitzkrieg with 

451
00:20:56,460 --> 00:21:01,291
those boxing punches.
He's forced to adapt and forced to for 

452
00:21:01,291 --> 00:21:05,730
forced to learn and grow.
But when it comes to like across the 

453
00:21:05,730 --> 00:21:05,730
board,
if you got,

454
00:21:05,950 --> 00:21:09,670
if we took everybody in the UFC roster,
a 400 plus guys,

455
00:21:09,671 --> 00:21:14,671
whatever it is,
and we brought him into the room and I 

456
00:21:14,671 --> 00:21:16,291
said,
show me how you'd throw a spinning back 

457
00:21:16,291 --> 00:21:16,291
kick,
show me how you throw.

458
00:21:16,291 --> 00:21:17,140
We'll kick.
1% of them would be doing it right.

459
00:21:17,320 --> 00:21:18,700
Maybe,
maybe 1%.

460
00:21:19,060 --> 00:21:21,460
Show me how to throw a right hand.
Hundred percent would do it right.

461
00:21:21,670 --> 00:21:23,830
Show me how to throw a left hook.
Just two variations.

462
00:21:24,100 --> 00:21:25,810
They would all be doing it right.
You know,

463
00:21:25,811 --> 00:21:27,370
either it's not hand,
you know,

464
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:29,460
a knuckles up or knuckles,
uh,

465
00:21:29,461 --> 00:21:32,080
across either one is fine.

466
00:21:32,230 --> 00:21:35,020
Both of them are effective,
but there's a lot of techniques that are

467
00:21:35,021 --> 00:21:38,290
still missing.
There's a lot because flexibility,

468
00:21:38,291 --> 00:21:42,100
dexterity with the legs and having those
abilities.

469
00:21:42,340 --> 00:21:44,380
I think that's the next level.
Shit.

470
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:49,560
And you're seeing guys like conor 
mcgregor who's coming along who throws 

471
00:21:49,560 --> 00:21:52,000
all these wild kicking techniques that a
lot of guys just don't.

472
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:53,890
They just don't have in their 
repertoire.

473
00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:59,040
They're straight Moy Tai.
But if you've got the Moitai end that I 

474
00:21:59,040 --> 00:22:01,180
think that's next level.
There's always room to improve,

475
00:22:01,181 --> 00:22:01,790
right?
Yeah.

476
00:22:02,140 --> 00:22:03,600
And were forever.
They will be.

477
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:08,640
For me,
the biggest area of improvement that 

478
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:10,051
people haven't really caught onto is the
cage yet using the cage really using the

479
00:22:10,061 --> 00:22:13,180
cage because the dynamics of fighting on
a cage are totally different.

480
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:18,500
And I would say over the past four years
we've had this kind of group around 

481
00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:19,000
rain.
Pat was there,

482
00:22:19,450 --> 00:22:21,220
I was there,
Mark Munoz,

483
00:22:21,221 --> 00:22:22,660
Bob Ballou contributed a little bit.

484
00:22:22,690 --> 00:22:24,820
Dan Henderson contribute a little bit 
like this,

485
00:22:25,170 --> 00:22:30,170
this whole approach,
a systematic approach to fight in the 

486
00:22:30,170 --> 00:22:32,851
cage.
Kind of came out through this whole 

487
00:22:32,851 --> 00:22:32,851
development process is really 
interesting and fun to be a part of.

488
00:22:32,851 --> 00:22:35,890
But that's an area that I see a lot of 
guys just still not.

489
00:22:36,550 --> 00:22:39,700
Here's the basic thing I have.
I watched fights with the notebook,

490
00:22:39,701 --> 00:22:44,701
right?
So every time I have new drills that 

491
00:22:44,701 --> 00:22:44,701
come out of every every card that I 
watch,

492
00:22:44,701 --> 00:22:47,350
and I noticed that when someone tries to
shoot a double leg,

493
00:22:48,220 --> 00:22:50,020
the first thing you do is you turn 
right,

494
00:22:50,021 --> 00:22:55,021
you turn your hips.
So your feet are now parallel to the 

495
00:22:55,021 --> 00:22:55,021
cage.
Mm hmm.

496
00:22:55,021 --> 00:22:59,070
I would watch probably 200 fights.
I saw one person finished a double leg 

497
00:22:59,070 --> 00:23:00,940
when their feet had turned to a parallel
position to the cage.

498
00:23:01,570 --> 00:23:02,890
Guys would still hang on to it.

499
00:23:02,890 --> 00:23:05,560
They'd get their head pushed down.
Maybe they get elbowed in that position.

500
00:23:05,590 --> 00:23:07,240
I'm Travis Browne,
Travis Browne.

501
00:23:07,241 --> 00:23:12,241
Yeah.
They hang onto this double when he's 

502
00:23:12,241 --> 00:23:12,241
turned.
If you now know visually,

503
00:23:12,241 --> 00:23:12,580
if you know anything you think about,
you're in a fight.

504
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:18,000
Adrenaline's going,
you're in your double leg and you look 

505
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:18,000
down,
you're looking at a guy's feet.

506
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:18,280
If at that point you see,
oh,

507
00:23:18,281 --> 00:23:20,280
they're not pointing straight out.
I have no double way.

508
00:23:20,290 --> 00:23:23,800
You can switch to your single shift.
That one little thing right there.

509
00:23:23,830 --> 00:23:28,830
All of a sudden you can teach somebody 
because one of the first things I have 

510
00:23:28,830 --> 00:23:28,830
to do is I have to help someone 
understand,

511
00:23:28,900 --> 00:23:31,330
number one,
their part in the overall scheme,

512
00:23:31,331 --> 00:23:34,480
how they fit into the culture and the 
current state of Emma,

513
00:23:34,780 --> 00:23:38,230
but also how they deal with every 
position in the cage and when they go in

514
00:23:38,231 --> 00:23:43,231
there,
I want them to know that they have a 

515
00:23:43,231 --> 00:23:45,091
system for approaching each of those,
so by breaking it down and 

516
00:23:45,091 --> 00:23:45,091
understanding,
okay,

517
00:23:45,091 --> 00:23:46,160
those,
that one little thing,

518
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:47,500
if their feet are here,
you have a double leg,

519
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:48,860
the feeder here,
you have a single leg.

520
00:23:49,110 --> 00:23:51,170
It's a very easy for them for them to 
grow on.

521
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:56,520
Well,
that's something that people that don't 

522
00:23:56,520 --> 00:23:56,780
really understand Ma and they just sort 
of watching a fight.

523
00:23:57,200 --> 00:24:02,200
I don't think they truly appreciate how 
much thinking involved and how much 

524
00:24:03,111 --> 00:24:07,070
technique and how much it really is this
massive,

525
00:24:07,220 --> 00:24:09,740
complex,
nuanced game of strategy.

526
00:24:10,040 --> 00:24:12,740
It's about brute force.
It's about kinetic energy.

527
00:24:12,741 --> 00:24:17,741
It's about endurance and will and grit,
but it's also about all those things 

528
00:24:17,741 --> 00:24:20,060
applied through discipline and 
technique.

529
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:25,320
It's about positioning and understanding
of knowledge and like this calculated 

530
00:24:25,320 --> 00:24:30,250
approach to training and like really 
going over every single detail of every 

531
00:24:31,101 --> 00:24:36,101
single position.
The challenge comes when you take a guy 

532
00:24:36,101 --> 00:24:36,101
and okay,
you're.

533
00:24:36,101 --> 00:24:37,310
Let's say you naturally are a good 
wrestler.

534
00:24:37,311 --> 00:24:38,240
He wrestled in college.

535
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:43,240
You have a long torso and short legs and
you'd have to then kind of start 

536
00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:47,770
steering someone in a direction because 
the the inherent problem with training 

537
00:24:47,770 --> 00:24:47,990
and I'm going to say is that there's too
much.

538
00:24:48,380 --> 00:24:50,390
I can't lift weights enough.
I can't do enough cardio.

539
00:24:50,391 --> 00:24:53,990
I can't do enough to get so I can't box.
I can see you have to go and down,

540
00:24:53,991 --> 00:24:58,991
okay,
we're going to not do all of this stuff 

541
00:24:58,991 --> 00:25:02,790
and we're going to know that we're not 
going to do it because we don't have 

542
00:25:02,790 --> 00:25:05,471
time to wait.
This is where our focus needs to be and 

543
00:25:05,471 --> 00:25:06,290
that's the why part of it.
Why are we doing what we're doing?

544
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:10,010
How do you choose that?
And then it changes based on the person,

545
00:25:10,011 --> 00:25:11,690
based on injuries,
based on age,

546
00:25:11,691 --> 00:25:14,120
based on opponent,
future opponents,

547
00:25:14,121 --> 00:25:16,520
kind of where you see the trajectory of 
their career going,

548
00:25:16,521 --> 00:25:17,000
all this.

549
00:25:17,030 --> 00:25:19,190
You have to be thinking about this stuff
in the process.

550
00:25:19,550 --> 00:25:24,550
Yeah.
And it seems like that's one of the 

551
00:25:24,550 --> 00:25:24,550
things when they always say styles make 
fights.

552
00:25:24,550 --> 00:25:27,980
That's where it really comes into play 
because you truly can't be the master of

553
00:25:27,981 --> 00:25:29,180
everything.
Impossible.

554
00:25:29,480 --> 00:25:30,730
Look,
Anderson Silva,

555
00:25:31,460 --> 00:25:33,290
he had a wrestling match.
Chael Sonnen,

556
00:25:33,300 --> 00:25:35,180
Chael sonnen would beat him every 
goddamn day of the week.

557
00:25:35,540 --> 00:25:38,710
They'd show up for a year.
Every God damn time they wrestled.

558
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:40,340
Channel double them,
take them down.

559
00:25:40,370 --> 00:25:45,370
He would.
He would beat him one points every 

560
00:25:45,370 --> 00:25:45,370
fucking time.
But it's am amazing at wrestling,

561
00:25:45,370 --> 00:25:48,020
you know.
And so some guys you,

562
00:25:48,290 --> 00:25:50,450
you can get away with doing that.
Some guys you could take down,

563
00:25:50,451 --> 00:25:51,620
you can ground them out.
Some guys,

564
00:25:51,621 --> 00:25:56,621
they figured out how to stand up.
They figure out how to move away from 

565
00:25:56,621 --> 00:25:56,621
you.
And some guys they can take you down.

566
00:25:56,621 --> 00:25:58,670
I mean there's a guy like Chael Sonnen 
who's gonna run into this.

567
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:01,250
Who is this Olympic savage has been 
training with um,

568
00:26:01,270 --> 00:26:06,270
Dan Henderson or with Daniel cormier and
he's got a couple World Battles Cup 

569
00:26:06,270 --> 00:26:06,620
Olympic medals.
Yeah.

570
00:26:06,890 --> 00:26:09,020
That guy,
if you got in there with Shell,

571
00:26:09,021 --> 00:26:11,930
Shell might find himself on his back and
they might be like,

572
00:26:11,931 --> 00:26:13,040
Oh,
good for her though,

573
00:26:13,041 --> 00:26:18,041
right?
Because you'll see guys wrestling and 

574
00:26:18,041 --> 00:26:20,351
the cage is very different.
Like if times in wrestling that you 

575
00:26:20,351 --> 00:26:20,690
would never attack a single leg and then
go around the waist.

576
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:25,720
Right?
Except if you're on the cage and then 

577
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:25,720
that's the best way to approach.
Right?

578
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:25,890
Right.
And also dependent.

579
00:26:26,730 --> 00:26:29,960
You have a guy like a Yoel Romero,
right.

580
00:26:30,020 --> 00:26:31,370
Stud.
Awesome.

581
00:26:31,730 --> 00:26:33,570
His,
his hasn't seen a,

582
00:26:33,710 --> 00:26:35,860
showed a whole lot of wrestling in his 
fights.

583
00:26:36,490 --> 00:26:41,490
Gets a couple takedowns here.
But tomorrow's he ragdolled tavares who 

584
00:26:41,490 --> 00:26:44,090
was throwing them around like a pillow.
But you look at some of these

585
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:47,520
for a guy.
I mean he had seven world metals,

586
00:26:47,550 --> 00:26:47,970
metals,
done.

587
00:26:47,971 --> 00:26:50,350
Everything he did,
if he didn't win May,

588
00:26:50,430 --> 00:26:52,450
maybe that metal was sold.
You know?

589
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:54,690
I mean,
he was so good,

590
00:26:54,750 --> 00:26:57,390
but brought this up the other day when 
he was wrestling,

591
00:26:57,391 --> 00:27:01,470
he was wrestling for minute matches,
so can you keep a pace up?

592
00:27:01,471 --> 00:27:06,471
Can you hit [inaudible] take downs?
Can you do three towns around or four 

593
00:27:06,471 --> 00:27:06,900
takedowns around over a period of 15 
minutes.

594
00:27:07,080 --> 00:27:08,730
Most guys can't do that.
Well,

595
00:27:08,731 --> 00:27:13,731
it's also the frame that he's used to 
carrying around for wrestling is 

596
00:27:13,731 --> 00:27:17,360
probably the wrong frame for Emma who 
should probably tone it down a little 

597
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:17,360
bit.
You know,

598
00:27:17,370 --> 00:27:22,370
I mean,
he's a big fog and you look at him when 

599
00:27:22,370 --> 00:27:25,431
he steps on the.
Not the weigh ins because he's a little 

600
00:27:25,431 --> 00:27:25,431
dehydrated,
but when he steps into the octagon,

601
00:27:25,431 --> 00:27:26,700
that fucking guy looks like a cartoon.

602
00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:30,900
I mean his waist is 27 inches.
His fucking shoulders a retarded.

603
00:27:30,901 --> 00:27:33,730
Everything is just as bubble muscle 
bubble.

604
00:27:33,731 --> 00:27:37,560
Last bubble thighs just.
He looks like just a super freak.

605
00:27:37,950 --> 00:27:39,320
Super Freak athlete.
Yeah.

606
00:27:39,330 --> 00:27:40,540
He's amazing.
His.

607
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:45,640
Well,
he saw his wrestling videos when he was 

608
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:45,640
active.
Obscene him.

609
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:45,900
Yeah.
He's amazing.

610
00:27:46,290 --> 00:27:51,290
Unbelievable speed.
His ability to close the distance is 

611
00:27:51,290 --> 00:27:51,720
shocking in mma.
You know,

612
00:27:51,721 --> 00:27:56,721
we saw that in the tovaras fight,
he tovaras move forward and he stepped 

613
00:27:56,721 --> 00:27:59,340
in while the virus is moving forward and
blasting him in the face with an elbow,

614
00:27:59,610 --> 00:28:02,730
but it was just like two guys moving at 
completely different speeds.

615
00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:07,760
He's the only guy I've seen to an ankle 
pick in an MMA fight tour and James 

616
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:08,390
Tony,
that was a little saying,

617
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:10,460
oh,
that was where I was a little single way

618
00:28:10,520 --> 00:28:13,920
from did it was a fight in Germany.
He literally was in a fighting stance,

619
00:28:13,921 --> 00:28:17,250
reached down from an outside grip,
grabbed the guy's ankle,

620
00:28:17,490 --> 00:28:19,530
lift it up over his head,
and the guy hit the mic.

621
00:28:19,610 --> 00:28:22,050
I want to see it.
That guy is different.

622
00:28:22,090 --> 00:28:22,830
He's.
But again,

623
00:28:22,860 --> 00:28:26,040
you have to look at are we fighting for 
25 minutes where we're fighting for in a

624
00:28:26,050 --> 00:28:31,050
foreman in a wrestling match,
because there had been some great 

625
00:28:31,050 --> 00:28:33,231
wrestlers,
amazing wrestlers who have come into 

626
00:28:33,231 --> 00:28:34,950
Emma and completely failed because for 
some reason they can't tune it in for 15

627
00:28:34,951 --> 00:28:35,970
minutes.
You know,

628
00:28:35,971 --> 00:28:38,430
who I really wish would have stuck in 
there,

629
00:28:38,520 --> 00:28:40,960
but it just wasn't his thing as rule on 
gardener.

630
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:44,460
Yeah,
I got my management start.

631
00:28:44,461 --> 00:28:49,461
It really unlocked a lot of ways.
My training start with Rulon rulon when 

632
00:28:49,461 --> 00:28:51,630
he fought Yoshida.
That was his first MMA fight,

633
00:28:51,631 --> 00:28:53,000
right?
It was.

634
00:28:53,001 --> 00:28:55,870
He had never been in a fight before.
We're in Japan and they were.

635
00:28:56,060 --> 00:29:01,060
Dan fought somebody on October 31st,
so they flew him in to Japan to Tokyo in

636
00:29:01,061 --> 00:29:04,500
October 31st and he was fighting exactly
eight weeks later.

637
00:29:04,740 --> 00:29:06,570
December 31st.
Was that New Year's eve?

638
00:29:06,580 --> 00:29:11,580
Sorry.
So he didn't show up in California for 

639
00:29:11,580 --> 00:29:15,291
16 days,
so that eight weeks to live when we're 

640
00:29:15,291 --> 00:29:15,910
gone.
Two and a half weeks.

641
00:29:15,911 --> 00:29:18,030
I've gotten six weeks left,
six weeks left.

642
00:29:18,210 --> 00:29:21,870
We have travel on Christmas,
so now let's go down to five weeks and I

643
00:29:21,871 --> 00:29:26,110
think he went out of town 12 days.
What he would have.

644
00:29:26,150 --> 00:29:31,150
There's no days left.
He would have a speaking engagement 

645
00:29:31,150 --> 00:29:31,150
here.
I gotta go,

646
00:29:31,150 --> 00:29:31,150
I'll be back tomorrow.
We'd miss a day here.

647
00:29:31,150 --> 00:29:32,820
He missed a day there,
so there's no days.

648
00:29:33,270 --> 00:29:34,920
That's no day.
It was a suit.

649
00:29:34,921 --> 00:29:39,921
It was a real challenge for sure,
but it's like five days of training or 

650
00:29:39,921 --> 00:29:39,921
something crazy.
It's more than that,

651
00:29:39,921 --> 00:29:44,790
I forget what it all came out to be,
but it made me kind of refocus myself to

652
00:29:44,921 --> 00:29:45,370
go,
okay,

653
00:29:45,371 --> 00:29:48,610
we have a limited amount of time.
He's never been in a fight before,

654
00:29:48,910 --> 00:29:50,230
like not on the school ground.

655
00:29:50,230 --> 00:29:51,550
Nothing like that.
Too Big.

656
00:29:51,640 --> 00:29:53,900
It really are.
You gonna stay an eighth grader,

657
00:29:53,901 --> 00:29:56,980
you find Ruan I don't think since 
fucking heads as big as this table.

658
00:29:57,070 --> 00:29:58,690
Yeah,
so it kind of had to decide,

659
00:29:58,691 --> 00:30:03,691
okay,
here's what we're going to do and then 

660
00:30:03,691 --> 00:30:03,691
deal with all the mental side of things.
Anxiety,

661
00:30:03,691 --> 00:30:05,140
have a fight coming up and that's a big 
deal.

662
00:30:05,141 --> 00:30:08,320
A lot to work in all that time.
So it was a unique challenge for him,

663
00:30:08,321 --> 00:30:13,321
but I like his striking approach to just
jabbed the fuck out of them to stepped 

664
00:30:13,321 --> 00:30:17,290
in and hit him with that goddamn 
telephone pole of a hand of it.

665
00:30:17,291 --> 00:30:22,291
It's just junk.
It's like extending a big telephone 

666
00:30:22,291 --> 00:30:22,840
poles and funk.
We worked on like four things.

667
00:30:23,300 --> 00:30:26,830
The same thing when so could you fought 
Nogueira the fight that you saw?

668
00:30:26,831 --> 00:30:28,930
That's what we did over and over for six
weeks.

669
00:30:29,170 --> 00:30:34,170
So when you.
When you put an athlete in these 

670
00:30:34,170 --> 00:30:34,170
situations where they're in over their 
head,

671
00:30:34,170 --> 00:30:39,060
you have to get super focused.
That funnel has gotta get totally 

672
00:30:39,060 --> 00:30:39,060
narrative,
okay,

673
00:30:39,060 --> 00:30:40,690
here's what we're doing.
This is the only thing you're allowed to

674
00:30:40,691 --> 00:30:45,691
think about.
Now you take care of everything else in 

675
00:30:45,691 --> 00:30:45,691
their life so they don't even have to 
focus on it,

676
00:30:45,691 --> 00:30:49,590
so then when they come in there,
you give them their best chance of 

677
00:30:49,590 --> 00:30:50,260
winning by doing this one thing.
It's a different strategy.

678
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:55,320
And so for Gardner,
what were the things you worked on that 

679
00:30:55,320 --> 00:30:55,990
job?
Closing the distance.

680
00:30:56,200 --> 00:31:01,200
Don't worry about throwing right hands.
It's hard to throw a punch off the 

681
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:01,390
backhand if you don't have experience.
Feels very exposed.

682
00:31:01,550 --> 00:31:03,770
Chink comes up.
Where's my distance?

683
00:31:03,771 --> 00:31:05,560
So behind that job?
Yeah,

684
00:31:05,561 --> 00:31:09,640
he had probably a hundred pounds on your
cheetah in the clinch position.

685
00:31:09,641 --> 00:31:11,560
I was fairly confident about that.

686
00:31:11,560 --> 00:31:13,330
And then to get on top,
cover his hips,

687
00:31:13,390 --> 00:31:15,220
grab as risk posture up and punch him.
No,

688
00:31:15,221 --> 00:31:16,660
he didn't do a great job with the ground
and pound,

689
00:31:16,661 --> 00:31:21,661
but we keep it very simple.
He was allowed to wear wrestling shoes 

690
00:31:21,661 --> 00:31:21,661
too.
Yeah.

691
00:31:21,661 --> 00:31:22,090
Which was,
yeah,

692
00:31:22,700 --> 00:31:27,700
you get a big guy like that with 
wrestling shoes on and grips totally 

693
00:31:27,700 --> 00:31:27,700
did.
Yeah,

694
00:31:27,700 --> 00:31:28,720
good luck taking him down.
Good fucking luck.

695
00:31:29,050 --> 00:31:31,390
Olympic gold medalists.
The last guy,

696
00:31:31,780 --> 00:31:33,710
I mean he did.
Who?

697
00:31:33,720 --> 00:31:38,720
Who the fuck did he beat in the finals 
was a weird thing.

698
00:31:38,861 --> 00:31:39,910
Was the grip thing,
right?

699
00:31:40,020 --> 00:31:42,130
Yeah.
It's basically I give it is tied.

700
00:31:42,910 --> 00:31:47,910
One guy gets to lock first.
If you lock first and you break your 

701
00:31:47,910 --> 00:31:47,910
grip,
then it's over.

702
00:31:47,910 --> 00:31:49,720
You could appoint.
So rule [inaudible] curl on locked.

703
00:31:50,440 --> 00:31:53,590
He broke his grip and that was it.
That's kind of ridiculous.

704
00:31:53,650 --> 00:31:54,910
Yeah.
They call that a point.

705
00:31:54,970 --> 00:31:58,240
That was a fairly recent rule to.
It wasn't like pitching [inaudible].

706
00:31:58,241 --> 00:32:01,480
That was 14 years in the time in that 
timeframe.

707
00:32:01,481 --> 00:32:03,940
They just recently changed the rules to 
keep up with wrestling,

708
00:32:04,050 --> 00:32:05,820
so I don't.
The rules always changed a little bit,

709
00:32:05,821 --> 00:32:08,080
but that's not a victory.
I mean it is,

710
00:32:08,081 --> 00:32:09,190
but it isn't.
You know what I mean?

711
00:32:09,191 --> 00:32:14,191
It's like God damn.
Especially when you're dealing with a 

712
00:32:14,191 --> 00:32:16,030
guy who's probably the greatest Russian 
heavyweight of all time,

713
00:32:16,120 --> 00:32:17,820
he's probably one of the greatest 
athlete.

714
00:32:17,950 --> 00:32:22,950
Olympic athletes have time.
He won every world and Olympic 

715
00:32:22,950 --> 00:32:25,600
championships for like 13 years.
He never lost the match.

716
00:32:25,601 --> 00:32:30,601
And international never lost a match in 
international competition until he met 

717
00:32:30,601 --> 00:32:31,570
Roland in the finals and lost because of
his grip broke.

718
00:32:31,630 --> 00:32:32,590
I mean,
nothing happened.

719
00:32:32,591 --> 00:32:34,510
You didn't get taken down and get throw 
into his head.

720
00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:35,530
Nothing.
Those,

721
00:32:35,560 --> 00:32:38,300
there's images of him.
There's images of Carrillo.

722
00:32:38,370 --> 00:32:40,650
Jamie pull up one of the images of 
Karalyn

723
00:32:40,690 --> 00:32:45,690
Andrew Carrillo and there's an image of 
him where he's fucking picking someone 

724
00:32:45,690 --> 00:32:49,781
up and reverse lynching his teeth and 
he's got this fucking psychotic look in 

725
00:32:49,781 --> 00:32:52,070
his eyes and his whole body doesn't even
look real.

726
00:32:52,250 --> 00:32:57,250
I mean in the middle of straining.
It's like he's got some extra muscles 

727
00:32:57,250 --> 00:32:57,250
that like,
you know,

728
00:32:57,250 --> 00:33:01,151
when you see the hulk,
like in the vendors isn't even real 

729
00:33:01,151 --> 00:33:04,121
muscles.
Like he's got muscles that don't belong 

730
00:33:04,121 --> 00:33:05,310
in the human body.
They're like extra connections and weird

731
00:33:05,311 --> 00:33:06,020
little,
you know,

732
00:33:06,050 --> 00:33:09,620
like the hulk is,
is not just extra muscular.

733
00:33:09,621 --> 00:33:10,970
He's not,
it's not a human frame.

734
00:33:11,180 --> 00:33:16,180
That's a totally different frame.
There was something about corral and 

735
00:33:16,180 --> 00:33:17,300
when he's fucking a supplement program,
like,

736
00:33:17,390 --> 00:33:19,760
um,
I think it probably had to do with a lot

737
00:33:19,761 --> 00:33:21,440
of stuff that,
uh,

738
00:33:21,470 --> 00:33:26,420
it's very hard to get a store.
You'd probably have to go to a scientist

739
00:33:26,780 --> 00:33:28,220
and you probably don't swallow it.

740
00:33:28,340 --> 00:33:33,340
It probably goes in through a needle 
into the muscle and just directly into 

741
00:33:33,340 --> 00:33:33,470
the muscle.
Well,

742
00:33:33,471 --> 00:33:34,190
you know,
his family,

743
00:33:34,220 --> 00:33:37,160
his parents were small.
His parents were like five,

744
00:33:37,161 --> 00:33:38,420
five and five,
seven.

745
00:33:38,660 --> 00:33:39,650
I didn't know that.
Yeah,

746
00:33:39,660 --> 00:33:44,660
there's a crazy photo from sports 
illustrated of Corella and walking with 

747
00:33:44,660 --> 00:33:45,050
his parents.
There's the picture.

748
00:33:45,051 --> 00:33:50,051
Look at that,
look at that fucking big fucking 

749
00:33:50,810 --> 00:33:55,190
fisherman.
He think he wanted to win in the 80s.

750
00:33:55,191 --> 00:33:56,310
Dan,
Dan Henderson,

751
00:33:56,330 --> 00:33:57,980
he sim,
she's now that could evolve.

752
00:33:57,990 --> 00:34:01,640
It used to go over to Russia and they 
would train with those guys.

753
00:34:01,970 --> 00:34:04,220
So they got so good that they will go 
spend.

754
00:34:04,850 --> 00:34:09,850
They've go spend months at a time there 
and heath would tell me Kremlin would 

755
00:34:09,850 --> 00:34:12,671
sit on the ground under a rope legs and 
just arms come up with 300 pounds,

756
00:34:13,310 --> 00:34:15,110
climbing up a rope with no arms up and 
down,

757
00:34:15,111 --> 00:34:15,650
up and down.

758
00:34:15,980 --> 00:34:20,690
I'm not surprised he was a freak athlete
is freakishly strong.

759
00:34:20,870 --> 00:34:25,870
So much so that guys would flatten out 
on their stomachs to try to keep him 

760
00:34:25,870 --> 00:34:30,650
from picking them up and throwing them 
on their heads at heavyweight crazy.

761
00:34:31,060 --> 00:34:36,060
Yeah.
You just take 300 pound guys from a 

762
00:34:36,060 --> 00:34:38,261
fully flattened out position and he 
would just scoop them up like they were 

763
00:34:38,261 --> 00:34:39,410
nothing and just launch them through the
fucking air.

764
00:34:40,190 --> 00:34:43,650
Only father time beat that guy just 
after awhile.

765
00:34:43,790 --> 00:34:48,790
You know,
he's running hot for father time and 

766
00:34:48,790 --> 00:34:48,790
Rulon Gardner Gardner.
Yeah.

767
00:34:48,790 --> 00:34:50,090
Sort of,
sort of beat them.

768
00:34:50,270 --> 00:34:55,270
I mean tactically beat him.
It didn't beat him like he beat 

769
00:34:55,270 --> 00:34:55,270
everybody else,
but gardener.

770
00:34:55,270 --> 00:34:55,940
I was like,
man,

771
00:34:55,941 --> 00:35:00,941
when I saw him beat Yoshida was like,
if this fucking guy really dedicates 

772
00:35:00,941 --> 00:35:04,590
himself and really dial down and gets to
an optimum weight and you know,

773
00:35:04,620 --> 00:35:05,600
I mean,
who the fuck is going to?

774
00:35:05,650 --> 00:35:08,510
He was supposed to fight again I suppose
by fader.

775
00:35:09,260 --> 00:35:10,930
They offered him over $1 million to 
fight.

776
00:35:11,150 --> 00:35:14,420
I did those deals.
They didn't offer $1 million.

777
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:17,270
Now the fight was for Nogueira on two 
weeks notice,

778
00:35:17,300 --> 00:35:20,740
but that was a different offer.
But there was an offer for fader.

779
00:35:20,760 --> 00:35:21,790
No,
there wasn't.

780
00:35:21,860 --> 00:35:24,620
So it's bullshit.
It was,

781
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:30,040
it was the first deal I ever did as a 
manager was 10 years ago and they called

782
00:35:30,680 --> 00:35:33,110
up.
They wanted to fight no guarantee on two

783
00:35:33,111 --> 00:35:35,840
weeks notice or tend to accept that,
but pride was always like that.

784
00:35:35,841 --> 00:35:38,100
You always found out two or weeks here 
you're going to fight

785
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:39,840
rule on Herman train.
He's like,

786
00:35:39,841 --> 00:35:40,860
man,
I haven't been training.

787
00:35:41,690 --> 00:35:44,640
You didn't train for the first one.
Go out there,

788
00:35:45,180 --> 00:35:47,370
shoot a double leg.
If you want,

789
00:35:47,371 --> 00:35:50,370
stick your arm at the Yo.
Nothing's going to happen.

790
00:35:50,371 --> 00:35:53,200
You're going to be fine.
And we told him to take it,

791
00:35:53,940 --> 00:35:56,160
but I'm just saying if you get scared,
you know,

792
00:35:56,170 --> 00:35:59,280
whatever,
which really put that in his head.

793
00:36:00,060 --> 00:36:01,550
If you get scared putting,
leave your arm.

794
00:36:01,560 --> 00:36:02,630
No,
of course not.

795
00:36:02,631 --> 00:36:07,631
I'm not going to say four sided already,
but I mean really what's going to 

796
00:36:07,631 --> 00:36:11,460
happen?
You're just going to get your big goal 

797
00:36:11,460 --> 00:36:13,861
out there and if you get and you don't 
like or you feel tapped out the care 

798
00:36:13,861 --> 00:36:14,880
setting so he's not going to try to 
break your arm.

799
00:36:15,570 --> 00:36:19,860
So it was a crazy like six hour 
negotiated back and forth and we're at a

800
00:36:19,861 --> 00:36:24,861
huge number and it turned out to be a 
three fight deal worth well over a 

801
00:36:25,530 --> 00:36:25,530
million dollars.

802
00:36:25,560 --> 00:36:28,120
The majority of it was for that fight on
two weeks notice.

803
00:36:28,121 --> 00:36:30,300
And then he decided that he didn't want 
to do it the next day,

804
00:36:31,410 --> 00:36:34,740
but it didn't end there.
And then he was given the opportunity on

805
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:38,610
two days notice to fight butter being at
the,

806
00:36:38,970 --> 00:36:40,740
uh,
at the pride event in Vegas.

807
00:36:41,940 --> 00:36:46,940
Two days.
Notice how the Athletic Commission 

808
00:36:46,940 --> 00:36:46,940
sanction that.
Well,

809
00:36:46,940 --> 00:36:46,940
they had,
it all worked out.

810
00:36:46,940 --> 00:36:51,681
He had to fly down that day.
Physicals and everything were all lined 

811
00:36:51,681 --> 00:36:55,521
up.
They would have found a way to get it 

812
00:36:55,521 --> 00:36:55,521
done.
He would've smashed butter bean.

813
00:36:55,521 --> 00:36:56,370
Come on up.
Been one AA battery.

814
00:36:56,420 --> 00:36:58,350
Won't be like a turtle on its back.
Yeah.

815
00:36:58,351 --> 00:36:59,220
He was smiling.
Well,

816
00:36:59,430 --> 00:37:02,400
you do have to worry about butter.
Been tagging you and you're coming in.

817
00:37:02,401 --> 00:37:06,660
But who's got a fuck an iron chin too.
He's a big guy.

818
00:37:07,430 --> 00:37:11,520
Cracked though.
That was the baddest really fat guy ever

819
00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:14,700
because he English four honors morbidly 
obese.

820
00:37:14,910 --> 00:37:17,160
He wasn't like fat.
Like Roy Nelson Fat.

821
00:37:17,490 --> 00:37:22,490
You know?
He makes Roy Nelson look like Michael 

822
00:37:22,490 --> 00:37:24,770
Phelps.
You know when you have the two of them 

823
00:37:24,770 --> 00:37:24,770
standing next to each other,
butter bean has like that weird underarm

824
00:37:24,770 --> 00:37:29,241
fat,
that fat that makes your arms stick out 

825
00:37:29,241 --> 00:37:29,241
like this.
We shared a locker room with him.

826
00:37:29,241 --> 00:37:30,960
He takes his own hands to those.
He.

827
00:37:31,050 --> 00:37:32,880
Yeah,
he's a motherfucker,

828
00:37:32,890 --> 00:37:35,910
a barbecue cook.
See Him cooking barbecue.

829
00:37:36,540 --> 00:37:38,420
He's a super nice guy.
Really good guy.

830
00:37:38,421 --> 00:37:40,290
Yeah.
Got The shit out of some barbecue.

831
00:37:40,770 --> 00:37:44,580
That's why he's with that big.
I've got one autograph for my adult life

832
00:37:44,581 --> 00:37:46,620
and it was some butter bay and I gave it
to my dad.

833
00:37:46,621 --> 00:37:47,310
I'm like,
listen man,

834
00:37:47,880 --> 00:37:50,190
you get assigned working.
Oh,

835
00:37:50,191 --> 00:37:51,410
that's cool.
But yeah,

836
00:37:51,480 --> 00:37:54,720
so rule on just decided no,
no more and it just wasn't for him.

837
00:37:54,820 --> 00:37:57,090
Now you know,
he just went bankrupt.

838
00:37:57,300 --> 00:37:59,280
There was this big thing,
some online.

839
00:37:59,281 --> 00:38:02,730
They're auctioning off all of his stuff.
His stuff from the Olympics.

840
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:04,620
Sad.
Yeah.

841
00:38:04,910 --> 00:38:09,610
And then he was on biggest loser.
He was like more than 350 pounds,

842
00:38:09,990 --> 00:38:14,040
450 pounds and he lost 150 pounds or 
something.

843
00:38:14,090 --> 00:38:18,900
Like what?
Is that just bad food or is he just.

844
00:38:19,550 --> 00:38:20,460
I mean,
to get that big,

845
00:38:20,461 --> 00:38:25,461
you need genetics to get that big.
I would have a hard time getting to 450 

846
00:38:25,461 --> 00:38:29,661
pounds is a big guy.
He's got a huge barrel chest and he 

847
00:38:29,661 --> 00:38:29,661
likes to eat.
There is the biggest loser.

848
00:38:29,661 --> 00:38:31,950
Jesus Christ.
That was sad.

849
00:38:31,951 --> 00:38:36,130
Seeing him too on this kind of freak 
show

850
00:38:36,490 --> 00:38:37,840
on TV.
You know,

851
00:38:37,841 --> 00:38:42,010
this is a goddamn Olympic gold medalist.
So this is a great wrestler,

852
00:38:42,070 --> 00:38:47,070
great athlete.
And you've seen them on the biggest 

853
00:38:47,070 --> 00:38:47,070
loser.
It's like,

854
00:38:47,070 --> 00:38:47,620
this is really the only way he can lose 
weight.

855
00:38:47,621 --> 00:38:48,790
I mean,
I don't understand it.

856
00:38:52,420 --> 00:38:53,530
That's how it goes,
right?

857
00:38:53,531 --> 00:38:55,300
I mean,
the life of the athlete.

858
00:38:55,570 --> 00:38:57,970
Now when you're.
You're a trainer,

859
00:38:58,060 --> 00:39:03,060
but you're also a manager.
I mean you're involved in a lot of 

860
00:39:03,060 --> 00:39:03,060
different.

861
00:39:03,060 --> 00:39:03,990
A long development process.
For me,

862
00:39:04,040 --> 00:39:09,040
I started,
I got a chiropractic degree and we go 

863
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:13,131
back.
I wrestled at Arizona State and met Dan 

864
00:39:13,131 --> 00:39:13,131
Henderson there.
Heat sims were there.

865
00:39:13,131 --> 00:39:17,930
Randy couture would be out there a 
little bit and then I moved to 

866
00:39:17,930 --> 00:39:19,520
California after that year later started
chiropractic school and continued.

867
00:39:19,530 --> 00:39:21,900
Dan and I were roommates for probably 
six years,

868
00:39:22,380 --> 00:39:24,180
so the whole time I was in chiropractic 
school,

869
00:39:24,181 --> 00:39:28,020
we would have training camps that are,
have sarandrea come spend a month before

870
00:39:28,021 --> 00:39:30,480
the 96 Olympics.
So there were always guys coming in.

871
00:39:30,481 --> 00:39:35,400
So the only people that I ever worked 
with were world class athletes.

872
00:39:35,490 --> 00:39:37,380
And as,
as the transition,

873
00:39:37,381 --> 00:39:42,381
Emma came in,
Dan was the number one wrestler in the 

874
00:39:42,381 --> 00:39:45,210
country and he made 12 grand a year.
What?

875
00:39:46,130 --> 00:39:51,130
As you get paid.
So if you're the number on the national 

876
00:39:51,130 --> 00:39:51,180
team,
he got a paycheck and that paycheck,

877
00:39:51,181 --> 00:39:51,960
thousand bucks a month.

878
00:39:52,050 --> 00:39:55,440
Yeah.
So he got a call in,

879
00:39:55,470 --> 00:39:59,410
I think it's 2008 to fight in Brazil.
Well,

880
00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:01,440
how much does it pay as well?
It's three fights in one night.

881
00:40:01,441 --> 00:40:03,390
If you win,
you get $12,000.

882
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:07,410
And Dan I think had been in street 
fights in his whole life and he goes,

883
00:40:07,411 --> 00:40:08,790
okay,
I went down,

884
00:40:08,791 --> 00:40:13,791
there is only Dan Henderson [inaudible] 
those three fights and that's his 

885
00:40:13,791 --> 00:40:14,270
career.
Got started.

886
00:40:14,290 --> 00:40:16,020
Now we've got one.
One of them by submission.

887
00:40:16,510 --> 00:40:18,150
Yeah.
It was the coolest submission ever.

888
00:40:18,180 --> 00:40:19,890
Guy.
He was a guillotine.

889
00:40:20,280 --> 00:40:25,280
He was standing up and the guy passed 
out on his feet and Dan ended up in a 

890
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:25,410
mount position.
Yeah.

891
00:40:25,470 --> 00:40:29,600
And then he beat another Carlson gracie 
black belt and the guy tapped.

892
00:40:29,601 --> 00:40:31,680
The crowd didn't like it.
The crowds storm the cage.

893
00:40:31,681 --> 00:40:34,760
It was a crazy moment.
The crowds didn't like that.

894
00:40:34,761 --> 00:40:39,761
The guy tapped,
the crowd thought the stoppage was 

895
00:40:39,761 --> 00:40:39,870
early.
Uh,

896
00:40:39,880 --> 00:40:41,820
and then there was a little bit of a 
riot,

897
00:40:41,821 --> 00:40:46,510
but the cage was really tall and they,
they kind of charged the Cajun Navy.

898
00:40:46,530 --> 00:40:48,290
The lights went out or something that 
wasn't there.

899
00:40:48,300 --> 00:40:51,480
Just in second hand on this one.
It's been awhile.

900
00:40:51,780 --> 00:40:54,390
The lights used to go out in those 
Brazilian mma valley.

901
00:40:54,450 --> 00:40:58,100
[inaudible] shit was going back to the 
cage.

902
00:40:58,160 --> 00:41:00,120
Yeah.
Eugenio today.

903
00:41:00,390 --> 00:41:02,040
And uh,
um,

904
00:41:02,170 --> 00:41:03,150
uh,
Henzel Gracie,

905
00:41:03,170 --> 00:41:04,980
remember the lights went out and hands 
on was losing.

906
00:41:06,090 --> 00:41:06,770
So he,
yes,

907
00:41:06,820 --> 00:41:08,560
down in there.
And then the guy then said,

908
00:41:08,561 --> 00:41:08,890
no,
no,

909
00:41:08,891 --> 00:41:10,900
I've lost my momentum.
I don't want to fight again.

910
00:41:11,500 --> 00:41:13,790
So he didn't want to continue,
lost my.

911
00:41:13,940 --> 00:41:15,790
And I think that he said something like 
that.

912
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:18,130
Okay.
So Dan.

913
00:41:18,160 --> 00:41:23,160
So Dan went and won the tournament.
That's how he kind of at least got his 

914
00:41:23,160 --> 00:41:26,551
entry into mma and then ended up in,
in rings that this King of King 

915
00:41:26,551 --> 00:41:28,210
Tournament,
that was 32 men.

916
00:41:28,580 --> 00:41:33,580
It was open wait tournament [inaudible] 
guys know on that as well going to say 

917
00:41:33,580 --> 00:41:34,550
he was in the next year

918
00:41:34,550 --> 00:41:36,650
or the year before something fader 
fought and rings.

919
00:41:36,651 --> 00:41:38,180
But I don't know if he was in the 
tournament,

920
00:41:39,410 --> 00:41:41,960
I'd have to go look at a record,
but Dan fights.

921
00:41:42,020 --> 00:41:43,010
He fights,
um,

922
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:48,280
to win it.
He fought three times a one 80 foot 

923
00:41:48,280 --> 00:41:48,980
ballou.
He fought a Gilbert ival and he fought.

924
00:41:49,220 --> 00:41:51,080
Um,
no gear.

925
00:41:51,081 --> 00:41:53,780
Big Nogueira wow.
It was funny on the bus.

926
00:41:53,781 --> 00:41:55,190
Know Gary told me this,
years later,

927
00:41:55,191 --> 00:41:58,070
nugget one the term,
the next year they paid Dan $200,000

928
00:41:58,071 --> 00:42:03,071
in cash as Japanese gangsters.
We'll send a trash walked in afterwards 

929
00:42:03,071 --> 00:42:05,990
and they handed him $200,000.
Guys do what?

930
00:42:05,991 --> 00:42:10,991
The cash.
We didn't really know what to do with 

931
00:42:10,991 --> 00:42:10,991
it.
It was me,

932
00:42:10,991 --> 00:42:11,180
Dan and randy walking around the streets
of Tokyo.

933
00:42:11,181 --> 00:42:14,090
$200,000
in a backpack trying to figure out,

934
00:42:14,091 --> 00:42:17,350
do we wire this wire it.
How'd you get it back to America?

935
00:42:17,360 --> 00:42:22,360
It just ended up brought it back and Dan
claimed it and pay the attorneys do 

936
00:42:22,360 --> 00:42:22,360
that.

937
00:42:22,360 --> 00:42:26,230
You could tell a hundred grand.
You just have to tell them because he 

938
00:42:26,230 --> 00:42:28,150
wasn't just selling coke and Tokyo.
Yeah.

939
00:42:28,151 --> 00:42:30,290
As long as you go,
I have this money.

940
00:42:30,580 --> 00:42:31,670
Oh,
I see.

941
00:42:31,730 --> 00:42:36,730
You know,
everyone knows about it was John John 

942
00:42:36,730 --> 00:42:37,070
when he fought over in Japan against 
frank trigg.

943
00:42:37,130 --> 00:42:42,130
Yeah.
The first fight I ever cornered someone 

944
00:42:42,130 --> 00:42:42,130
in.
Oh,

945
00:42:42,130 --> 00:42:42,130
was it really?
Yeah.

946
00:42:42,130 --> 00:42:42,470
I acquired frank trigg in that fight.
Wow.

947
00:42:42,500 --> 00:42:44,960
In 1998.
Randy in in a way on that.

948
00:42:45,020 --> 00:42:47,780
They took the money and they'll do it to
like all the brothers.

949
00:42:47,810 --> 00:42:49,850
They all brought it over.
I'm sorry.

950
00:42:49,910 --> 00:42:51,590
You only have to figure out how to do 
it.

951
00:42:51,970 --> 00:42:54,800
Chef pants you don't have.
You can't have more than 10,000

952
00:42:54,801 --> 00:42:59,801
bucks on you without claiming it.
You allow to be a baller with like 9,999

953
00:43:00,561 --> 00:43:02,300
bucks.
I think in those days.

954
00:43:02,301 --> 00:43:07,301
Everyone who fought in pride probably 
shove some in their underwear when they 

955
00:43:07,301 --> 00:43:07,301
were coming through and cross your 
fingers.

956
00:43:07,301 --> 00:43:12,300
Right.
Everything was paid in cash over there 

957
00:43:12,300 --> 00:43:12,300
because you know when you fill out a 
customs form,

958
00:43:12,300 --> 00:43:13,730
it asks you,
do you have more than $10,000?

959
00:43:14,180 --> 00:43:17,030
He collects no and weird month number.
You know,

960
00:43:17,390 --> 00:43:18,380
I have to pick a number,
right?

961
00:43:18,381 --> 00:43:19,400
Yeah.
They have to pick a number.

962
00:43:19,401 --> 00:43:23,030
I think that's like one of those numbers
to like if you deposit it in their bank,

963
00:43:23,240 --> 00:43:28,240
like red flags go off,
it's more than 10 grand so you have to 

964
00:43:28,240 --> 00:43:31,721
like sneak in like nine that started,
that started in the 80s and for all the 

965
00:43:31,721 --> 00:43:32,330
coke in Miami.
Ah,

966
00:43:32,360 --> 00:43:35,210
but if it wasn't for coke in Miami in a 
mattress to be.

967
00:43:35,211 --> 00:43:35,830
No.
Miami.

968
00:43:35,840 --> 00:43:38,480
Yeah.
More more banks per capita than anywhere

969
00:43:38,481 --> 00:43:40,160
else in the fucking country for a 
reason.

970
00:43:40,620 --> 00:43:45,620
And the cowboys.
My favorite documentary and cooking 

971
00:43:45,620 --> 00:43:46,100
cowboys too.
Have you seen to maybe even better?

972
00:43:47,720 --> 00:43:48,680
Yeah.
Billy Corbin,

973
00:43:49,250 --> 00:43:50,960
I gotta get that guy on the podcast one 
of these days.

974
00:43:50,960 --> 00:43:54,710
The Guy who produced the awesome guy,
fucking great documentaries,

975
00:43:54,711 --> 00:43:55,670
man.
It's so well done.

976
00:43:55,671 --> 00:43:58,310
It just such a crazy,
crazy fucking story.

977
00:43:58,610 --> 00:43:59,810
So anyway,
Dan,

978
00:44:00,440 --> 00:44:01,910
one,
$200,000

979
00:44:01,911 --> 00:44:06,911
in cash.
But it was funny you saw he really saw 

980
00:44:06,911 --> 00:44:09,770
it.
Dan was made of in that because I think 

981
00:44:09,770 --> 00:44:11,951
he probably took his first fight was 
with Gilbert evil and he probably took 

982
00:44:11,951 --> 00:44:13,850
them down 14 times and then knocked him 
down at the beginning,

983
00:44:13,851 --> 00:44:16,480
which had never been done before.
He almost are barred.

984
00:44:16,510 --> 00:44:18,450
Then he probably,
someone will have to come.

985
00:44:18,500 --> 00:44:21,800
I think it was well over 10 takedowns 
and when he came to the back,

986
00:44:21,801 --> 00:44:26,801
because you have a fairly quick 
turnaround time and those tournament 

987
00:44:26,801 --> 00:44:26,801
days,
it's a whole different mentality.

988
00:44:26,860 --> 00:44:29,090
So you go back into the locker room 
yourself out?

989
00:44:29,600 --> 00:44:30,680
Yeah,
in his head,

990
00:44:30,681 --> 00:44:32,310
never.
His forearms were so

991
00:44:32,310 --> 00:44:37,310
swollen.
He couldn't really make a make a fist 

992
00:44:37,310 --> 00:44:39,420
and then he fought Bob Lou.
I just think so much grappling,

993
00:44:39,421 --> 00:44:42,240
so much squeezing and they just weren't 
settling down.

994
00:44:42,600 --> 00:44:47,600
Then they went and fought Bob Ballou and
his knee got hurt and I remember turned 

995
00:44:47,600 --> 00:44:48,620
into randy between before the 
[inaudible].

996
00:44:48,780 --> 00:44:53,780
I don't know if he can.
I don't know if he can go out there and 

997
00:44:54,001 --> 00:44:56,010
Dan was hobbling around.
He preaches laying there.

998
00:44:56,011 --> 00:44:58,620
He couldn't move at all,
couldn't move his leg.

999
00:44:58,621 --> 00:45:03,621
His arms are still swollen mean he was.
His whole body was seizing up and we've 

1000
00:45:03,621 --> 00:45:07,340
Kinda got them moving a little bit and 
that's when they play the national 

1001
00:45:07,340 --> 00:45:07,340
anthem.
Before the finals,

1002
00:45:07,340 --> 00:45:11,990
you could see his whole physiology and 
posture change was really a cool moment 

1003
00:45:11,990 --> 00:45:15,441
to see and everything changed and he 
went down there and and fought a very 

1004
00:45:15,441 --> 00:45:19,101
close fight with Nogueira giving up and 
all those guys weighed over 240 pound 

1005
00:45:19,101 --> 00:45:23,511
Dan is every bit of 200 pounds.
He fought all three of them and won a 

1006
00:45:23,511 --> 00:45:26,040
bunch of money and that's kind of how he
got his start end up in pride after that

1007
00:45:27,290 --> 00:45:31,440
national anthem fire to my papa.
You can see,

1008
00:45:31,810 --> 00:45:33,110
you can see,
he can see it.

1009
00:45:33,200 --> 00:45:35,160
Shane is a whole change in him when it 
happened.

1010
00:45:35,350 --> 00:45:40,350
Wow.
It has to be something above and beyond 

1011
00:45:40,350 --> 00:45:40,980
yourself to get through moments like 
that.

1012
00:45:41,320 --> 00:45:42,830
If it's nationalism,
whatever it is,

1013
00:45:42,831 --> 00:45:47,831
they'll carry you through.
He got it done and they ended up ended 

1014
00:45:47,831 --> 00:45:47,831
up in pride after that.

1015
00:45:48,230 --> 00:45:49,730
Wow.
Well,

1016
00:45:49,731 --> 00:45:53,330
he fought in the UFC to write early days
early to Helen go as.

1017
00:45:53,750 --> 00:45:55,400
And I was there for that 97.

1018
00:45:55,570 --> 00:45:57,130
And um,
what's his name?

1019
00:45:58,960 --> 00:46:01,240
Carla.
Kinda dreadlock hair.

1020
00:46:01,241 --> 00:46:02,710
Canadian good grappler.

1021
00:46:02,870 --> 00:46:03,590
Oh yeah,
yeah.

1022
00:46:03,620 --> 00:46:04,940
Carlos.
Carlos Newton.

1023
00:46:04,960 --> 00:46:06,740
Yeah.
Carlos knew it was a very good rapport.

1024
00:46:06,800 --> 00:46:10,100
He was one of the first,
like really complex grapplers that would

1025
00:46:10,101 --> 00:46:10,760
fight,
you know,

1026
00:46:10,761 --> 00:46:13,940
no Ge style complex grappling.
He was fantastic.

1027
00:46:13,941 --> 00:46:15,650
He was really good.
He is a vicious,

1028
00:46:15,651 --> 00:46:18,740
vicious fucking grappling.
I'm going to fight with him and mad.

1029
00:46:18,790 --> 00:46:23,790
He got mad.
He was in a triangle amount who slammed 

1030
00:46:23,790 --> 00:46:23,790
him on his head and didn't even know he 
won.

1031
00:46:23,790 --> 00:46:25,310
No one knew what was happening or both.
Our both out.

1032
00:46:25,340 --> 00:46:26,540
Yeah.
He choked me out.

1033
00:46:26,541 --> 00:46:29,420
He was out and as Matt Hughes was 
getting choked out,

1034
00:46:29,421 --> 00:46:31,520
he slammed him on his head and knocked 
him out cold.

1035
00:46:31,820 --> 00:46:36,820
So Matt Hughes woke up the champion and 
that was after Carlos had caught and pat

1036
00:46:39,051 --> 00:46:42,290
miletich and the first ever bulldog 
choke in MMA economy.

1037
00:46:42,310 --> 00:46:45,680
The school you're at that school yard,
headlock and sat back,

1038
00:46:45,740 --> 00:46:47,480
which is fucking very effective.

1039
00:46:47,480 --> 00:46:49,370
Move hard.
It's hard to get out of.

1040
00:46:49,371 --> 00:46:54,371
Hard to get out of.
That's a weird move that people sort of 

1041
00:46:54,371 --> 00:46:56,741
disrespect.
It's weird because they respect the 

1042
00:46:56,741 --> 00:46:56,741
[inaudible] [inaudible] I guess the good
team,

1043
00:46:56,741 --> 00:47:01,301
even as even they respect the standing 
18 like John Jones did on Machita are 

1044
00:47:01,301 --> 00:47:04,130
and Weidman did on who did hooded me,
catching the standard routine.

1045
00:47:05,960 --> 00:47:08,930
I forget it was a.
It doesn't matter,

1046
00:47:09,260 --> 00:47:11,000
but they don't.
For whatever reason,

1047
00:47:11,001 --> 00:47:13,070
the school yard choke is like,
oh,

1048
00:47:13,100 --> 00:47:14,910
come on.
It's because there's so much discretion.

1049
00:47:15,010 --> 00:47:17,000
Choke.
It's brutal.

1050
00:47:17,001 --> 00:47:19,270
It's probably the strongest of all jokes
if you can get there.

1051
00:47:19,280 --> 00:47:24,280
Yeah.
Get your backing into it and you're 

1052
00:47:24,280 --> 00:47:24,280
pushing off with your legs and digging 
in with it.

1053
00:47:24,280 --> 00:47:27,010
I mean a bunch of guys that got it.
Chris lytle got it on Tki.

1054
00:47:27,140 --> 00:47:32,140
You know,
it's happened a few times in the since 

1055
00:47:32,140 --> 00:47:34,591
then,
but I think I'm pretty sure when Newton 

1056
00:47:34,591 --> 00:47:37,051
got pat miletich and it was the first 
time anybody ever pull that choke off 

1057
00:47:37,051 --> 00:47:38,620
and that's a,
that's another one of those techniques.

1058
00:47:38,620 --> 00:47:39,310
It's like,
oh,

1059
00:47:39,311 --> 00:47:41,770
those things that's real,
that's a real move.

1060
00:47:42,160 --> 00:47:43,540
Okay.
You know,

1061
00:47:43,541 --> 00:47:46,270
and over the course of the x amount of 
years,

1062
00:47:46,271 --> 00:47:49,150
so 21 years since the UFC started,
we've,

1063
00:47:49,480 --> 00:47:54,480
every now and then we'll see one of 
those things pop up and then you see 

1064
00:47:54,480 --> 00:47:54,480
them everywhere.
You know,

1065
00:47:54,480 --> 00:47:54,790
you see one pop up like,
oh,

1066
00:47:54,791 --> 00:47:56,200
now it's everywhere.
Yeah,

1067
00:47:56,470 --> 00:47:57,640
it's cool though,
isn't it?

1068
00:47:58,030 --> 00:47:58,750
It's the,
it's the,

1069
00:47:58,990 --> 00:48:01,090
it's a real joy in this sport.
It's a development.

1070
00:48:01,690 --> 00:48:03,610
Yeah.
They'll kind of seeing that through.

1071
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:09,000
Yeah.
I love when new things like that come 

1072
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:09,000
up,
you know.

1073
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:10,270
And one of the new things that you're 
seeing now is,

1074
00:48:10,420 --> 00:48:12,880
um,
I haven't seen it in the UFC yet,

1075
00:48:12,881 --> 00:48:17,881
but I know we're going to see it soon.
Is that baseball bat choke from the 

1076
00:48:17,881 --> 00:48:17,980
bottom?
Have you seen that?

1077
00:48:18,460 --> 00:48:23,460
There's this crazy new choke.
The guys who are doing it was a good 

1078
00:48:23,460 --> 00:48:23,460
joke and someone figured out how to do 
it.

1079
00:48:23,460 --> 00:48:26,260
No biggie.
And it's like when you're on the bottom,

1080
00:48:26,261 --> 00:48:28,750
when the guy's on top of you inside 
control,

1081
00:48:28,990 --> 00:48:32,710
you wrap your arm over his head like 
this with like palm up.

1082
00:48:32,890 --> 00:48:35,980
You grab it like this and pinch it down 
and it's death.

1083
00:48:36,340 --> 00:48:41,340
It's death when guys are good at it.
They clamp a hold of your neck and 

1084
00:48:41,340 --> 00:48:44,281
you're going out.
You've got a couple seconds to either 

1085
00:48:44,281 --> 00:48:44,281
tabs,
both sides,

1086
00:48:44,281 --> 00:48:44,281
right?
Both sides,

1087
00:48:44,281 --> 00:48:48,510
and if guys are good at it,
you know it's one of those things where 

1088
00:48:48,510 --> 00:48:49,900
you teach a guy how to do a good routine
and he doesn't really know it yet.

1089
00:48:49,980 --> 00:48:51,880
Be showing the movement and you say,
okay,

1090
00:48:51,881 --> 00:48:53,950
get me into gear to and as soon as he 
tries to slap it on,

1091
00:48:54,070 --> 00:48:56,080
you grab his wrist,
you pull your head up,

1092
00:48:56,081 --> 00:49:01,081
your posture,
you get yourself out of it and you're 

1093
00:49:01,081 --> 00:49:03,691
free.
You know it's because you're better at 

1094
00:49:03,691 --> 00:49:05,320
the defense than he is,
but when it's a position that you're not

1095
00:49:05,321 --> 00:49:10,321
used to defending and this baseball bat 
job position than a lot of people are 

1096
00:49:10,321 --> 00:49:10,321
not used to fund these.

1097
00:49:10,321 --> 00:49:15,060
A bunch of positions that people just 
not used to finding themselves in those 

1098
00:49:15,060 --> 00:49:16,180
critical seconds.
That's critical,

1099
00:49:16,181 --> 00:49:18,670
may not even seconds like fractions of a
second.

1100
00:49:18,820 --> 00:49:23,820
From when you realize that choke is 
getting on to where you have to defend 

1101
00:49:23,820 --> 00:49:27,391
yourself.
And if you don't do it at six on either 

1102
00:49:27,391 --> 00:49:27,391
your neck,
like fuck,

1103
00:49:27,391 --> 00:49:28,810
like you might not be able to get out of
this.

1104
00:49:28,811 --> 00:49:32,850
There's that.
The window between safe and fucking.

1105
00:49:32,860 --> 00:49:35,420
I missed the boat I missed upon.
I'm fucking drowning shit.

1106
00:49:35,710 --> 00:49:38,050
Your destinies in that window.
Isn't that crazy?

1107
00:49:38,110 --> 00:49:43,110
Yeah.
The destinies in those windows and the 

1108
00:49:43,110 --> 00:49:43,780
scrambles also,
and this is a thing that we're seeing in

1109
00:49:43,850 --> 00:49:48,850
mma a lot lately is scrambles off the 
cage and the striking in the scrambles 

1110
00:49:50,140 --> 00:49:53,110
you're seeing like these,
these little mini moments,

1111
00:49:53,290 --> 00:49:58,290
you know,
where the guys are separating and one 

1112
00:49:58,290 --> 00:50:00,721
guy will land in need of the body hard,
neither the body and the other is an 

1113
00:50:00,721 --> 00:50:00,721
opening for both guys.

1114
00:50:00,721 --> 00:50:02,680
But one guy maybe decided to take a 
little bit of a break,

1115
00:50:02,980 --> 00:50:04,240
breathe,
you know,

1116
00:50:04,241 --> 00:50:09,241
and pace himself.
And the other guy pushed it and 

1117
00:50:09,241 --> 00:50:10,570
capitalized in land.
That's where I spend 95% of my.

1118
00:50:10,571 --> 00:50:15,571
If I'm coaching two sides,
it's really just kind of artist 

1119
00:50:15,571 --> 00:50:15,571
development,
right?

1120
00:50:15,571 --> 00:50:18,360
So there's the management side to it,
negotiating,

1121
00:50:18,370 --> 00:50:19,030
deal,
sponsor,

1122
00:50:19,031 --> 00:50:24,031
that type of thing.
There's a healthcare side of it because 

1123
00:50:24,031 --> 00:50:26,101
you have to take care of your body.
They're just helping people deal with 

1124
00:50:26,101 --> 00:50:26,710
the media.
There's finding developmental fights and

1125
00:50:26,711 --> 00:50:31,711
then there's training aspect,
so what I do on the training side of 

1126
00:50:31,711 --> 00:50:33,110
things is just what you said.
It's it's those moments,

1127
00:50:33,111 --> 00:50:38,111
those transitional moments,
so we'll have experts come in who will 

1128
00:50:38,111 --> 00:50:39,020
do the Jujitsu,
had finished that show,

1129
00:50:39,021 --> 00:50:44,021
what's the best way,
and the strikers who will hold pads and 

1130
00:50:44,021 --> 00:50:47,231
the coach for that.
My job is to kind of tie everything all 

1131
00:50:47,231 --> 00:50:47,231
together and tying it together.

1132
00:50:47,231 --> 00:50:51,850
You have to have a good understanding of
the big picture and understand how you 

1133
00:50:51,850 --> 00:50:56,141
start connecting these dots between all 
these different things and that's the 

1134
00:50:56,141 --> 00:50:59,171
key to where [inaudible] heading in.
It's not who can do the best arm bar 

1135
00:50:59,171 --> 00:51:00,680
anymore.
It's this transitional moments.

1136
00:51:00,681 --> 00:51:05,681
That's the why are you doing what you're
doing and finding those opportunities 

1137
00:51:05,681 --> 00:51:06,520
and those moments.
Yeah.

1138
00:51:06,540 --> 00:51:11,540
It's also we've had a chance to see this
progress and we see the whole game 

1139
00:51:12,501 --> 00:51:17,450
change or used to be like for a long 
time or the Mark Coleman era.

1140
00:51:17,630 --> 00:51:22,630
It was the big powerful wrestler.
They could take guys down and smash 

1141
00:51:22,630 --> 00:51:26,351
them.
And then those guys were fucked body 

1142
00:51:26,351 --> 00:51:26,351
body head.
Yeah.

1143
00:51:26,351 --> 00:51:28,280
But then we found guys like Maury Smith 
that could survive.

1144
00:51:28,400 --> 00:51:33,400
They had really good cardio and then he 
would start dragging you into the later 

1145
00:51:33,400 --> 00:51:34,730
rounds and kicking the shit out of your 
legs.

1146
00:51:34,910 --> 00:51:36,200
So then it was like,
oh fuck,

1147
00:51:36,201 --> 00:51:37,370
there's that,
you know.

1148
00:51:37,371 --> 00:51:40,520
And then in pride you saw cro,
cop,

1149
00:51:40,610 --> 00:51:42,430
Cro,
cop came along and change it.

1150
00:51:42,440 --> 00:51:46,730
Now here's a guy who is got vicious 
takedown defense.

1151
00:51:46,870 --> 00:51:50,570
His take down defense is catlike and if 
he kicks you,

1152
00:51:50,720 --> 00:51:52,370
you're not even going to know what the 
fuck happened.

1153
00:51:52,400 --> 00:51:57,400
You're just going to be out cold.
And his highlight reel over and over 

1154
00:51:57,400 --> 00:52:00,590
again is him head kicking the Shit Outta
Emelianenko head,

1155
00:52:00,591 --> 00:52:05,591
kicking the shit out of a grove of 
chanting head kicking the shit out of 

1156
00:52:05,591 --> 00:52:06,020
everybody.
Boom,

1157
00:52:06,021 --> 00:52:08,110
boom.
Vandelay Boehm.

1158
00:52:08,240 --> 00:52:10,970
Everybody's going asleep.
Left high kick poem.

1159
00:52:11,430 --> 00:52:12,940
It's like fuck,
now this,

1160
00:52:12,960 --> 00:52:15,140
this guy,
you know.

1161
00:52:15,141 --> 00:52:15,980
And then,
um,

1162
00:52:16,250 --> 00:52:18,620
then we realized when he came over to 
the UFC,

1163
00:52:18,980 --> 00:52:20,450
you got to see a couple of things going 
on.

1164
00:52:20,570 --> 00:52:25,570
One,
there's a lot of speculation like what 

1165
00:52:25,570 --> 00:52:27,590
was he doing with his body when he was 
in pride?

1166
00:52:27,700 --> 00:52:30,650
What was he doing as far as like 
supplementation?

1167
00:52:30,651 --> 00:52:33,080
What was he doing as far as like the 
performance enhancing drugs?

1168
00:52:33,200 --> 00:52:36,080
Was he involved in anything because he 
was a different fighter.

1169
00:52:36,230 --> 00:52:41,230
He's a different fighter from pride to 
the UFC and then he fought Gonzaga and 

1170
00:52:41,230 --> 00:52:43,220
you saw the difference between what 
happens when you get stuck on the cage.

1171
00:52:43,460 --> 00:52:46,760
What happens when a guy is not used to 
training or fighting in a cage?

1172
00:52:46,761 --> 00:52:51,761
I'm,
I don't even think he had a cage in his 

1173
00:52:51,761 --> 00:52:51,761
gym.
You know,

1174
00:52:51,761 --> 00:52:54,731
before the Gonzaga fine.
I don't think it was used to that shit 

1175
00:52:54,731 --> 00:52:54,731
at all.
And elbows on the ground.

1176
00:52:54,731 --> 00:52:58,460
That's another big element that the UFC 
had over pride and Gonzaga fucked him up

1177
00:52:58,520 --> 00:53:03,520
before he ever had kicked him.
He was just beating the shit out of him 

1178
00:53:03,520 --> 00:53:03,680
on the ground and elbowed him in the 
head.

1179
00:53:03,930 --> 00:53:05,660
We've got to see that.
This,

1180
00:53:05,690 --> 00:53:10,690
this transition.
You know when a guy like Gonzaga head 

1181
00:53:10,690 --> 00:53:10,690
kick,
a guy like cro cop,

1182
00:53:10,740 --> 00:53:15,140
that's an epic moment in that moment,
and he crumbled was a cro cop,

1183
00:53:15,141 --> 00:53:19,970
cro cop was an epic moment in mma.
He got to see that there's,

1184
00:53:20,030 --> 00:53:21,410
first of all,
there's another level.

1185
00:53:21,590 --> 00:53:23,360
The level that you were fighting in and 
pride,

1186
00:53:23,361 --> 00:53:25,830
as amazing as it was is not the highest 
level.

1187
00:53:26,040 --> 00:53:31,040
Guys like Fujita guys like Gilbert Ivo,
very tough guys where they're not the 

1188
00:53:31,040 --> 00:53:31,200
high level.
They're not.

1189
00:53:31,230 --> 00:53:33,540
They're not the junior dos Santos is of 
the world.

1190
00:53:33,750 --> 00:53:35,320
They're not the Cain Velasquez of the 
words.

1191
00:53:35,340 --> 00:53:40,340
There's a whole nother level.
There's a whole nother thing that's a 

1192
00:53:40,340 --> 00:53:41,280
beautiful thing about having several 
organizations,

1193
00:53:41,520 --> 00:53:43,490
but that's a confusing thing about 
having several,

1194
00:53:43,560 --> 00:53:48,560
several organizations because the guy 
looks like a world beater when he's 

1195
00:53:48,560 --> 00:53:49,230
fighting guys who are like mid level 
fighters,

1196
00:53:49,590 --> 00:53:51,900
but then he goes over to the UFC and you
know,

1197
00:53:51,960 --> 00:53:56,960
you put them in there against someone 
like like a lumbar or like a high level 

1198
00:53:56,960 --> 00:53:57,540
guy and you get to see what he's really 
made out of.

1199
00:53:57,960 --> 00:54:01,590
There's probably not that talent pool to
support multiple organizations.

1200
00:54:02,490 --> 00:54:03,330
Not yet,
right,

1201
00:54:03,870 --> 00:54:08,870
but it seems like they could develop it.
The problem is there's very few people 

1202
00:54:08,870 --> 00:54:12,801
really develop and talent,
so you have have kinda like a couple of 

1203
00:54:12,801 --> 00:54:12,801
different pressure.

1204
00:54:12,801 --> 00:54:13,520
The thing.
So here's my.

1205
00:54:13,800 --> 00:54:18,800
If I'm giving advice to anyone who wants
to fight and you think you're going to 

1206
00:54:18,800 --> 00:54:19,080
be good,
you have to get out of a team,

1207
00:54:19,250 --> 00:54:22,470
individual group training situation as 
quickly as possible.

1208
00:54:22,560 --> 00:54:24,440
In what way?
Okay.

1209
00:54:24,450 --> 00:54:26,400
So when,
when I got most started,

1210
00:54:26,610 --> 00:54:31,610
he hadn't fought before.
He went from no fights to beat into 

1211
00:54:31,610 --> 00:54:34,050
Sassy and becoming strikeforce champion 
in 19 months.

1212
00:54:34,300 --> 00:54:39,300
And every single workout he did through 
that entire time was for him on that 

1213
00:54:39,300 --> 00:54:40,800
day.
So I see that's what you're saying.

1214
00:54:40,801 --> 00:54:45,801
So yeah.
The auntie she gave the air for group 

1215
00:54:45,801 --> 00:54:46,800
training is for sparring sessions.
But if,

1216
00:54:47,210 --> 00:54:50,910
if you come from a karate background,
I come from a Jujitsu background.

1217
00:54:50,970 --> 00:54:55,970
Our developmental approach to fighting 
in the UFC was going to be very 

1218
00:54:55,970 --> 00:54:59,481
different if we do it the same,
the neither one of us are going to 

1219
00:54:59,481 --> 00:54:59,610
progress as quickly as possible.

1220
00:54:59,880 --> 00:55:02,220
So you have to find someone who's 
willing to work,

1221
00:55:02,221 --> 00:55:07,221
really invest time and energy into and 
create a training structure and program 

1222
00:55:07,221 --> 00:55:09,450
for you that you can get from here to 
here as quickly as possible.

1223
00:55:09,540 --> 00:55:12,330
I'm a firm believer that starting at the
bottom is the worst place to start.

1224
00:55:12,660 --> 00:55:14,850
You have to take what skill someone 
already does.

1225
00:55:14,851 --> 00:55:19,851
Well,
I'm presuming they came from a 

1226
00:55:19,851 --> 00:55:21,621
background.
Maybe you wrestled or maybe you had a 

1227
00:55:21,621 --> 00:55:21,621
black belt in Jujitsu.
You have.

1228
00:55:21,621 --> 00:55:24,390
You have to take those approaches and as
quickly as possible get them to here and

1229
00:55:24,470 --> 00:55:26,160
they're often very different 
trajectories.

1230
00:55:26,430 --> 00:55:30,000
What do you do with a young kid who's 
coming up that doesn't have any skills?

1231
00:55:30,180 --> 00:55:32,220
They're just wanting to learn 
[inaudible].

1232
00:55:32,610 --> 00:55:36,940
I don't really work with those guys.
So what would you say to one though?

1233
00:55:36,941 --> 00:55:39,510
Like say if someone came along like some
15 year old kid says,

1234
00:55:39,511 --> 00:55:41,430
Hey,
I'm a huge UFC fan.

1235
00:55:41,700 --> 00:55:44,400
I want to fight him and Mary A,
how should I get started?

1236
00:55:44,460 --> 00:55:46,800
I would have him pick one discipline to 
start.

1237
00:55:46,801 --> 00:55:48,870
If you're 15 years old,
go wrestle.

1238
00:55:49,380 --> 00:55:54,380
If you,
if you are more drawn to boxing or 

1239
00:55:54,380 --> 00:55:54,380
kickboxing and then go do that along the
way,

1240
00:55:54,380 --> 00:55:57,930
play and experiment a little bit,
but athlete development is changing now.

1241
00:55:57,931 --> 00:56:00,870
There's this,
this trend for when kids are as young as

1242
00:56:00,871 --> 00:56:01,860
five,
six years old,

1243
00:56:02,070 --> 00:56:04,080
that there's these intensive training 
program.

1244
00:56:04,081 --> 00:56:06,120
She have larger cities where there's 
good resource,

1245
00:56:06,121 --> 00:56:10,680
good coaching and good facilities.
They take these kids from an early age,

1246
00:56:10,681 --> 00:56:12,960
maybe they train with football or 
basketball or hockey,

1247
00:56:12,970 --> 00:56:16,410
something like this with the intent of 
developing professional athletes.

1248
00:56:16,560 --> 00:56:20,400
This approaches almost producing zero 
professional athletes.

1249
00:56:20,700 --> 00:56:23,950
The ones who are successful are the ones
who played three and four sports growing

1250
00:56:23,951 --> 00:56:24,220
up

1251
00:56:24,550 --> 00:56:28,510
and then they get to a certain age and 
then they start narrowing in and kind of

1252
00:56:28,511 --> 00:56:30,850
defining the best way to be.
What are they going to do?

1253
00:56:31,240 --> 00:56:33,620
The Australians did it before the 
Olympics in [inaudible].

1254
00:56:34,120 --> 00:56:36,850
They started to take it a whole bunch of
metrics on their athletes finding,

1255
00:56:36,851 --> 00:56:41,851
okay,
you're not good enough to win a medal 

1256
00:56:41,851 --> 00:56:41,851
here.
Have you thought about this?

1257
00:56:41,851 --> 00:56:41,851
Try this.
And as a result,

1258
00:56:41,851 --> 00:56:44,320
the Ozzies,
they've won national governing body for,

1259
00:56:44,830 --> 00:56:46,870
um,
for their Olympic sports development.

1260
00:56:47,020 --> 00:56:49,240
As a result,
they did 10 times per capita.

1261
00:56:49,420 --> 00:56:53,410
The amount of metals at the US did in 
2012.

1262
00:56:53,860 --> 00:56:55,540
Um,
in,

1263
00:56:55,720 --> 00:56:57,310
in the UK,
they did the same thing.

1264
00:56:57,311 --> 00:57:01,000
They took it a little bit further as an 
example of one woman who was good,

1265
00:57:01,120 --> 00:57:06,120
I think she was some type of distance 
runner or something that all sorts of 

1266
00:57:06,120 --> 00:57:06,120
measurements,
like the,

1267
00:57:06,370 --> 00:57:08,020
the risk to elbow measurement.

1268
00:57:08,020 --> 00:57:09,820
And this is more technical than than I 
know,

1269
00:57:09,821 --> 00:57:12,460
but they found she had this certain 
measurement in here and said,

1270
00:57:12,461 --> 00:57:13,900
okay,
you're not gonna win a medal on this.

1271
00:57:13,901 --> 00:57:15,550
Have you ever considered rowing?
She goes,

1272
00:57:15,551 --> 00:57:20,551
I've never done.
Wrote three years later she was Olympic 

1273
00:57:20,551 --> 00:57:20,551
champion.
What's,

1274
00:57:20,551 --> 00:57:24,830
you could be at a little bit rowing 
champion three years thinking about if 

1275
00:57:24,830 --> 00:57:25,130
you are already a well trained athlete 
for something else.

1276
00:57:25,131 --> 00:57:27,340
It involved that type of cardiovascular 
stuff.

1277
00:57:27,420 --> 00:57:30,970
Then you have this specific biomechanics
that fits.

1278
00:57:30,971 --> 00:57:35,971
So if you know what those biomechanics 
or you know what to look for in an 

1279
00:57:35,971 --> 00:57:36,280
athlete,
you can steer them in this direction.

1280
00:57:36,281 --> 00:57:39,730
The UK did great with metal counts.
That's amazing.

1281
00:57:39,760 --> 00:57:42,130
So I take the same approach.
I've always done this.

1282
00:57:42,490 --> 00:57:44,110
I was never.
I wrestled in college,

1283
00:57:44,111 --> 00:57:46,270
but I was never.
There was never like Dan,

1284
00:57:46,690 --> 00:57:48,970
you know,
I was never a great in one thing,

1285
00:57:48,971 --> 00:57:53,971
but I was always really good and I think
it'll lava came from my chiropractic 

1286
00:57:53,971 --> 00:57:54,460
background and really looking at 
somebody figuring out,

1287
00:57:54,461 --> 00:57:56,020
okay,
here's what's going on with you.

1288
00:57:56,260 --> 00:57:57,880
Finally we communicate with them and 
saying,

1289
00:57:57,881 --> 00:58:02,881
okay,
I think this is the best course of 

1290
00:58:02,881 --> 00:58:02,881
action for you based on all these 
things.

1291
00:58:02,881 --> 00:58:03,080
Well,
I live now.

1292
00:58:03,081 --> 00:58:04,960
I had trained a little bit with it.
I love the rubber card,

1293
00:58:04,961 --> 00:58:09,961
right?
But for someone like Dan who's got a 

1294
00:58:09,961 --> 00:58:12,781
long torso,
zero flexibility and a great wrestling 

1295
00:58:12,781 --> 00:58:16,201
with a sledge hammer right hand,
should we invest time and energy on 

1296
00:58:16,201 --> 00:58:18,940
learning a rubber guard?
Probably not the best strategy for them.

1297
00:58:18,941 --> 00:58:23,941
Right?
There's other approaches because to get 

1298
00:58:23,941 --> 00:58:23,941
good at it,
you have to put all this energy.

1299
00:58:23,941 --> 00:58:27,400
Pat was another great example for him.
He was heavy punching,

1300
00:58:27,401 --> 00:58:32,401
great wrestling,
so we're not going to spend a whole lot 

1301
00:58:32,401 --> 00:58:32,590
of time at age two pets,
maybe 30 years old.

1302
00:58:32,591 --> 00:58:35,920
We can't spend a whole lot of time 
working at tax from your back.

1303
00:58:36,320 --> 00:58:38,650
He has shorter legs and he's a bitch.

1304
00:58:38,950 --> 00:58:40,870
I've never seen him and be able to hold 
him down.

1305
00:58:41,290 --> 00:58:43,210
So where do you invest his time and 
energy?

1306
00:58:43,211 --> 00:58:46,000
It comes back to the whole thing and I'm
amazed that we don't have enough time.

1307
00:58:46,470 --> 00:58:47,560
All this.
We don't have enough time.

1308
00:58:47,561 --> 00:58:52,360
You have to now pick and choose,
so the more information you have to kind

1309
00:58:52,361 --> 00:58:54,490
of make those decisions and help funnel 
someone,

1310
00:58:54,491 --> 00:58:56,920
you can speed up an athlete's 
development considerably.

1311
00:58:57,100 --> 00:58:59,320
If you're stuck in a training room,
I go to a big mega,

1312
00:58:59,350 --> 00:59:04,350
mega camp with 70 fighters or something.
You're not going to get the quality of 

1313
00:59:04,350 --> 00:59:08,140
attention from coaches.
If you're coming up and you learn the 

1314
00:59:08,140 --> 00:59:11,041
techniques that everyone else is doing,
you're not learning the techniques that 

1315
00:59:11,041 --> 00:59:11,041
are best for you.
In theory,

1316
00:59:11,130 --> 00:59:13,230
there's a lot of guys that are saying 
that,

1317
00:59:13,231 --> 00:59:13,940
you know,
they're,

1318
00:59:13,941 --> 00:59:16,950
they're switching camps because they're 
saying that the camp that they're at,

1319
00:59:16,980 --> 00:59:20,250
they don't get enough attention and when
they spar it's just wars.

1320
00:59:20,380 --> 00:59:22,100
No one,
no one's being real tactical.

1321
00:59:22,100 --> 00:59:23,750
Do you see that a lot?
All the time.

1322
00:59:24,780 --> 00:59:25,500
You can,
uh,

1323
00:59:25,600 --> 00:59:29,240
really I can watch it one time in one 
training session,

1324
00:59:29,630 --> 00:59:34,630
three or four people.
I've always had a really small group of 

1325
00:59:34,630 --> 00:59:37,751
people who have had success moving 
people up quickly and helping them 

1326
00:59:37,751 --> 00:59:40,250
become really good at what they do by 
taking this approach.

1327
00:59:40,280 --> 00:59:45,280
And if I had,
if I was managing 40 people where I was 

1328
00:59:45,280 --> 00:59:47,060
at an event once I heard this one guy,
a pretty well known fighter go,

1329
00:59:47,360 --> 00:59:52,360
I tell my managers all time,
just think about me for one minute a 

1330
00:59:52,360 --> 00:59:52,850
day.
And I turned to him and said,

1331
00:59:52,851 --> 00:59:54,670
well,
I better very careful what you ask for.

1332
00:59:54,690 --> 00:59:56,030
She just may get that,
you know,

1333
00:59:56,480 --> 01:00:01,480
my theory is this,
if you're going to ask somebody to go 

1334
01:00:01,480 --> 01:00:04,661
get in their underwear and fight in a 
cage for their money to pay their rent 

1335
01:00:04,661 --> 01:00:05,630
that month,
that person deserves a lot of attention,

1336
01:00:08,490 --> 01:00:13,490
especially if if,
if my income comes with their success 

1337
01:00:13,490 --> 01:00:13,850
and I'm saying,
Oh hey,

1338
01:00:13,851 --> 01:00:16,040
I'm going to sit here and you're gonna,
go in the cage and fight.

1339
01:00:16,340 --> 01:00:18,950
You deserve every.
Everything that I can give you.

1340
01:00:19,100 --> 01:00:22,820
That's what you deserve,
but it's hard for people to find someone

1341
01:00:22,821 --> 01:00:27,821
like you that's willing to do that.
There's not that many of you guys out 

1342
01:00:27,821 --> 01:00:31,391
there.
There's a lot of guys that are doing it 

1343
01:00:31,391 --> 01:00:33,080
with all due respect.
I think they're doing a cursory job.

1344
01:00:33,140 --> 01:00:33,470
Yeah.
Oh,

1345
01:00:33,590 --> 01:00:38,590
for sure.
Like if you want becoming a manager and 

1346
01:00:38,590 --> 01:00:38,590
Emma May now go up to any fighter and 
say,

1347
01:00:38,590 --> 01:00:41,270
I can get you a bunch of sponsorships 
and they'll immediately sign with you.

1348
01:00:41,271 --> 01:00:44,060
Right.
There's no big picture thought to what's

1349
01:00:44,061 --> 01:00:49,061
being done in 95% of these guys.
It's a lot like being a young standup 

1350
01:00:49,061 --> 01:00:53,560
comedians that you're starving and 
you're looking for someone to come 

1351
01:00:53,560 --> 01:00:56,321
along.
It's going to alleviate some of that 

1352
01:00:56,321 --> 01:00:56,321
financial pressure,
so we're going to get you gigs.

1353
01:00:56,321 --> 01:00:57,710
I get you sponsors,
I get your fights.

1354
01:00:57,890 --> 01:01:01,750
I can get you into bellator or UFC.
I can get you into the TFA.

1355
01:01:01,760 --> 01:01:03,280
Whatever the fuck you gonna fight in.
Yeah.

1356
01:01:03,950 --> 01:01:08,950
That's a big thing is like these young 
fighters that are just fucking barely 

1357
01:01:08,950 --> 01:01:12,821
hanging on.
They're barely making ends meet and 

1358
01:01:12,821 --> 01:01:14,981
someone comes along and they're smooth 
talk and then they got to get rid of 

1359
01:01:14,981 --> 01:01:18,611
those fuckers when things go good.
The chance to have that guy or or 

1360
01:01:18,611 --> 01:01:21,220
whoever developing you to have longterm 
success in your careers.

1361
01:01:21,230 --> 01:01:26,230
It's virtually slim to none.
Evan will be in the old ticket 

1362
01:01:26,230 --> 01:01:26,230
commission check a commission check 
here.

1363
01:01:26,230 --> 01:01:31,060
Maybe it's a bad business decision for 
me is probably ways to make more money 

1364
01:01:31,060 --> 01:01:34,601
by by having 40 people,
but there was not to be excellent and 

1365
01:01:34,601 --> 01:01:35,660
we're.
We're here to win championships.

1366
01:01:35,690 --> 01:01:40,690
If you ever see me in the corner,
if you ever see me working with someone 

1367
01:01:40,690 --> 01:01:40,690
because I expect them to go win that 
fight in my heart,

1368
01:01:40,690 --> 01:01:42,440
I believe that they're going to go win 
that fight or us.

1369
01:01:42,830 --> 01:01:47,180
I shouldn't be there.
You advise coming to take the fight with

1370
01:01:47,181 --> 01:01:49,040
cormier that had to be a fight where 
you're like,

1371
01:01:49,160 --> 01:01:52,070
Ooh,
this is a tricky one.

1372
01:01:52,071 --> 01:01:54,460
It was like seven days notice.
Yeah,

1373
01:01:54,790 --> 01:01:59,790
are all tricky.
I got most are like that and dreaming 

1374
01:01:59,790 --> 01:02:00,260
Sengoku as well.
I create a bidding war between dream and

1375
01:02:00,261 --> 01:02:05,261
Sango.
Como didn't have anything to his name 

1376
01:02:05,261 --> 01:02:05,660
and he fought for a huge person.
I mean he was good for awhile after that

1377
01:02:05,661 --> 01:02:07,340
one fight and it went really well for 
him.

1378
01:02:07,580 --> 01:02:12,580
He went and knocked out travis view in a
minute or two and it started his whole 

1379
01:02:12,580 --> 01:02:15,500
career with pat.
Pat was is probably the most challenging

1380
01:02:15,740 --> 01:02:20,040
experience you've had with somebody 
because from the time

1381
01:02:20,040 --> 01:02:22,050
I started working with him,
people knew he was good.

1382
01:02:22,560 --> 01:02:27,560
Like I saw him spar gifts to us in three
weeks before Jon Jones and pat was six 

1383
01:02:27,560 --> 01:02:29,250
weeks off of minor knee injury and I saw
how that one,

1384
01:02:29,580 --> 01:02:32,190
if you've ever found anyone who's 
trained with pet companies went,

1385
01:02:32,191 --> 01:02:35,460
oh boy nightmares.
Just fucking savage.

1386
01:02:35,461 --> 01:02:40,090
He is so good.
So he saw the kingsbury fight,

1387
01:02:40,590 --> 01:02:43,070
Kingsbury fight.
You got to see what is really keeping.

1388
01:02:43,080 --> 01:02:45,180
You know what?
That was 50% of him.

1389
01:02:45,270 --> 01:02:50,270
That's amazing.
I still wasn't terribly pleased with 

1390
01:02:50,270 --> 01:02:50,270
that performance.
He was.

1391
01:02:50,270 --> 01:02:51,830
He's so much better than that.
He's a tough fuck.

1392
01:02:52,320 --> 01:02:55,560
He says in Kingsbury was in there.
Not too when he was in there to get by,

1393
01:02:55,561 --> 01:02:57,600
which is hard to finish someone in those
situations,

1394
01:02:57,601 --> 01:02:59,970
but when he was there to win for the 
first couple of minutes,

1395
01:03:00,630 --> 01:03:02,460
but in June,
like I read some interviews,

1396
01:03:02,461 --> 01:03:02,940
he said,
you know,

1397
01:03:02,941 --> 01:03:07,941
my,
my personal goal here is to get through 

1398
01:03:07,941 --> 01:03:07,941
this.

1399
01:03:07,941 --> 01:03:07,941
It wasn't,
I'm going to smash this guy.

1400
01:03:07,941 --> 01:03:12,600
Was it different mentality?
He had done a few IOWASCA sessions and 

1401
01:03:13,080 --> 01:03:15,900
that sort of changed his whole outlook 
on life,

1402
01:03:16,430 --> 01:03:21,430
kind of become a very different person.
Something happens to crossover to the 

1403
01:03:21,430 --> 01:03:22,770
other side.
Yeah.

1404
01:03:22,860 --> 01:03:26,580
Especially if you're a guy who's made a 
living being a savage,

1405
01:03:27,030 --> 01:03:32,030
you know,
and then all of a sudden it's difficult 

1406
01:03:32,030 --> 01:03:32,030
to continue for long periods of time.
Yeah.

1407
01:03:32,030 --> 01:03:34,230
So pat got the call and I got the whole 
story was true.

1408
01:03:34,550 --> 01:03:39,550
I had 50 guys turned him down.
It got to the point where I'm offering 

1409
01:03:39,550 --> 01:03:42,030
promoters like,
how much do I have to pay you to get him

1410
01:03:42,031 --> 01:03:47,031
a fight?
And the best stories is one promoter on 

1411
01:03:47,031 --> 01:03:47,031
the east coast said,
okay,

1412
01:03:47,031 --> 01:03:49,560
I'm want sign him to a fight deal.
I said,

1413
01:03:49,561 --> 01:03:54,561
okay,
because you have to get me a hundred 

1414
01:03:54,561 --> 01:03:54,561
tickets.
So how much are the tickets?

1415
01:03:54,561 --> 01:03:55,170
$30.
I said,

1416
01:03:55,171 --> 01:03:57,630
okay,
she want me to pay you $3,000

1417
01:03:57,631 --> 01:03:58,470
every time.
Pat Fights.

1418
01:03:58,471 --> 01:04:03,471
Okay,
I'll pay that and you have to pay for 

1419
01:04:03,471 --> 01:04:03,471
your travel and hotel.
So now we're just laughing.

1420
01:04:03,471 --> 01:04:06,390
So now that will cause it to do this.
He wanted exclusive deal.

1421
01:04:06,391 --> 01:04:09,780
I have to pay him $15,000
to sign pat to an exclusive deal.

1422
01:04:09,800 --> 01:04:14,800
It's ridiculous.
Even that guy couldn't find them in 

1423
01:04:14,800 --> 01:04:14,800
upon.
Wow.

1424
01:04:14,800 --> 01:04:16,170
So you agree to this and saw I'm not 
going to do that,

1425
01:04:16,171 --> 01:04:21,171
but I still will find us an opponent.
Of course you'd never had anybody and 

1426
01:04:21,171 --> 01:04:21,840
that's a hilarious deal though.
That W,

1427
01:04:21,841 --> 01:04:23,250
W,
pat and I were laughing.

1428
01:04:23,251 --> 01:04:26,610
Can you say what organization or member 
three letters on the east coast.

1429
01:04:26,611 --> 01:04:29,820
I have no idea what the letters mean,
but we were going everywhere.

1430
01:04:29,850 --> 01:04:31,870
I mean if,
if you were.

1431
01:04:32,420 --> 01:04:33,330
I was,
I was trying,

1432
01:04:33,331 --> 01:04:36,390
I would try to find opponents for him 
and then set him up for,

1433
01:04:36,630 --> 01:04:38,130
okay,
I have an opponent,

1434
01:04:38,250 --> 01:04:39,690
here's,
this will pay for all this.

1435
01:04:39,710 --> 01:04:42,570
No one wanted to fight pet coming.
So we got the call.

1436
01:04:43,580 --> 01:04:46,680
It was,
it was a whole mad rush at this point,

1437
01:04:46,980 --> 01:04:51,980
three weeks early,
he had started working at this coffee 

1438
01:04:51,980 --> 01:04:54,261
shop.
So he's getting up at two in the 

1439
01:04:54,261 --> 01:04:54,261
morning,
going to the coffee shop,

1440
01:04:54,261 --> 01:04:56,550
training,
sleeping five hours a night.

1441
01:04:56,551 --> 01:05:00,210
This went on for three weeks and I 
barged into the coffee shop and said,

1442
01:05:00,211 --> 01:05:02,190
hey,
dan is on the phone.

1443
01:05:02,670 --> 01:05:04,410
You wanna fight Daniel.
And he goes,

1444
01:05:04,710 --> 01:05:05,970
yes,
absolutely.

1445
01:05:06,090 --> 01:05:11,040
And that's how everything got going,
but we've got to quit.

1446
01:05:11,070 --> 01:05:13,040
The job,
because they didn't want to talk on that

1447
01:05:13,070 --> 01:05:14,460
until they told me he was fire.
They said,

1448
01:05:14,461 --> 01:05:15,680
pack your stuff and go home.
I'm like,

1449
01:05:15,740 --> 01:05:16,320
ah,
see,

1450
01:05:17,040 --> 01:05:21,040
and then literally 12 hours later,
10 hours later,

1451
01:05:21,190 --> 01:05:26,190
he's live on Fox talking shit to Daniel.
I hadn't.

1452
01:05:26,831 --> 01:05:29,050
Hadn't slept in 24 hours and then.

1453
01:05:29,200 --> 01:05:34,200
But here's what people don't.
People don't understand all the see all 

1454
01:05:34,200 --> 01:05:34,570
the behind the scenes stuff.
So that was the day.

1455
01:05:34,571 --> 01:05:36,010
So 24 hours,
no sleep,

1456
01:05:36,011 --> 01:05:38,110
and then we have to do all of your 
medicals in a day.

1457
01:05:38,111 --> 01:05:40,810
That's a huge task and there's a whole 
bunch of media.

1458
01:05:41,020 --> 01:05:44,470
Try to work some training in there and 
then couple days later we're on.

1459
01:05:44,740 --> 01:05:45,880
I think I have.
There's four nights,

1460
01:05:45,881 --> 01:05:50,881
I think I slept two hours a night so 
that by the time we get to vegas he's 

1461
01:05:50,881 --> 01:05:52,750
super happy,
relaxed but tired.

1462
01:05:53,460 --> 01:05:55,130
And I have this,
this picture of this gauge.

1463
01:05:55,131 --> 01:05:57,610
You mentioned a pressure gauge in the 
middle of the needles right here.

1464
01:05:57,611 --> 01:05:59,500
This is like we are now,
we're calm.

1465
01:05:59,501 --> 01:06:01,660
Everything is centered.
The needle goes this way.

1466
01:06:01,661 --> 01:06:05,650
It's all called call negative emotions,
like maybe a little worry,

1467
01:06:05,680 --> 01:06:07,120
anxiety,
fear,

1468
01:06:07,330 --> 01:06:07,980
panic,
you know,

1469
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:09,640
we started to bury into the red section.

1470
01:06:09,640 --> 01:06:13,840
On the other side is all positive 
emotions will cost the green side and we

1471
01:06:13,841 --> 01:06:16,150
have like happiness,
joy,

1472
01:06:16,540 --> 01:06:18,110
excitement,
caution,

1473
01:06:18,310 --> 01:06:23,310
confidence,
and then you kind of get to this manic 

1474
01:06:23,310 --> 01:06:24,790
like almost right before your fight.
You're so ready to go.

1475
01:06:25,180 --> 01:06:27,340
If your needle is on either side of 
this,

1476
01:06:27,550 --> 01:06:31,860
you're burning energy,
so even if you get into a sitter,

1477
01:06:31,880 --> 01:06:34,840
impat was super happy.
He was great.

1478
01:06:34,841 --> 01:06:39,841
The media,
I felt great about things all week 

1479
01:06:39,841 --> 01:06:39,841
because he was so relaxed,
feeling good,

1480
01:06:39,841 --> 01:06:41,680
but he was almost feeling too excited 
and too happy.

1481
01:06:42,310 --> 01:06:44,170
So wherever that needle is on either 
side,

1482
01:06:44,171 --> 01:06:46,180
you're burning energy.
Then come fight time.

1483
01:06:46,870 --> 01:06:50,680
You haven't slept for three weeks.
You've been doing this job.

1484
01:06:50,681 --> 01:06:52,670
All of a sudden you have this huge 
adrenaline dress.

1485
01:06:52,671 --> 01:06:53,770
I'm,
no one will fight me.

1486
01:06:54,640 --> 01:06:58,510
I'm in the UFC and a co main event.
Here we are against Daniel.

1487
01:06:59,140 --> 01:07:02,560
I think what happened in the fight is 
he,

1488
01:07:02,680 --> 01:07:05,590
he stopped being a participant in,
became an observer.

1489
01:07:06,430 --> 01:07:08,710
He stepped out of the moment in that 
situation,

1490
01:07:08,711 --> 01:07:11,350
so it was just overwhelmed by it or the 
whole thing.

1491
01:07:11,380 --> 01:07:12,580
Yeah,
but not overwhelmed.

1492
01:07:12,581 --> 01:07:15,280
Like in the sense that it was too much.
You didn't want to be there.

1493
01:07:15,400 --> 01:07:17,290
There's different types of overwhelmed,
right?

1494
01:07:17,440 --> 01:07:20,890
He had just expanded so much energy that
you want.

1495
01:07:20,891 --> 01:07:25,891
You only have so much energy.
You can only push so hard even if it's 

1496
01:07:25,891 --> 01:07:25,891
all really good,
positive things.

1497
01:07:25,891 --> 01:07:27,670
If you have all these amazing things 
happening in your life,

1498
01:07:27,671 --> 01:07:32,230
you still have to take a breath,
return to center.

1499
01:07:32,231 --> 01:07:34,090
It's like if you take a pendulum,
you hold it up,

1500
01:07:34,091 --> 01:07:37,540
it's going to swing wildly for awhile 
before it settles back down again.

1501
01:07:37,780 --> 01:07:39,160
Your job,
if you're going to do,

1502
01:07:39,161 --> 01:07:40,330
uh,
uh,

1503
01:07:40,360 --> 01:07:45,360
be involved with the sport like this is 
you have to keep super centered and 

1504
01:07:45,360 --> 01:07:45,360
focused.

1505
01:07:45,360 --> 01:07:45,360
So,
oh,

1506
01:07:45,360 --> 01:07:46,390
I won a bunch of money.
Okay.

1507
01:07:46,660 --> 01:07:47,710
Oh,
I just lost the fight.

1508
01:07:47,711 --> 01:07:49,660
Okay.
And the guy who is best at this,

1509
01:07:49,661 --> 01:07:51,730
I think just naturally personality wise 
was Dan.

1510
01:07:52,480 --> 01:07:54,670
Dan was always right here.
We're in a big fight.

1511
01:07:55,240 --> 01:07:55,960
Lose something.
I mean,

1512
01:07:56,140 --> 01:07:58,210
feel Dan could win $1 million.
It okay,

1513
01:07:58,270 --> 01:08:03,270
just a little bump up and really be.
He was always very centered Lavonne and 

1514
01:08:03,270 --> 01:08:06,340
I think that's one reason why he was so 
successful that pat is also like that,

1515
01:08:06,341 --> 01:08:11,341
but he was just thrown into this 
environment where there was so much 

1516
01:08:11,341 --> 01:08:13,600
energy being spent.
By the time he came into the fight,

1517
01:08:14,020 --> 01:08:15,860
it was difficult to to involved with 
that.

1518
01:08:15,861 --> 01:08:15,990
Now

1519
01:08:16,130 --> 01:08:18,800
I'm not saying that he would have one.
Daniel was clearly the better fighter.

1520
01:08:18,801 --> 01:08:20,000
Don't misunderstand what I'm saying 
here,

1521
01:08:20,001 --> 01:08:23,210
but you have to kind of look at the 
whole arc of,

1522
01:08:23,410 --> 01:08:27,080
of this experience and not only just 
with fight week,

1523
01:08:27,290 --> 01:08:29,990
you have to take that same overall view 
of your career.

1524
01:08:30,800 --> 01:08:32,720
So if you're a young fighter and you're 
struggling,

1525
01:08:32,721 --> 01:08:33,530
that's good.
You know,

1526
01:08:33,531 --> 01:08:34,760
struggle,
worried about how you're gonna,

1527
01:08:34,850 --> 01:08:36,290
pay your rent.
That's not a bad thing.

1528
01:08:37,130 --> 01:08:42,130
You have to look at everything that 
you're doing and the bigger picture of 

1529
01:08:42,130 --> 01:08:42,130
things.
And for me,

1530
01:08:42,130 --> 01:08:45,791
the bigger pictures,
we want to go win championships in the 

1531
01:08:45,791 --> 01:08:45,791
UFC.
That is the whole goal.

1532
01:08:45,800 --> 01:08:48,830
Anything less than that,
go do something else.

1533
01:08:48,920 --> 01:08:52,460
Don't risk this type of lifestyle.
That is not your intent.

1534
01:08:53,390 --> 01:08:55,010
How many different guys you're working 
with now?

1535
01:08:56,210 --> 01:08:58,730
I have three.
I managed three fighters in the UFC.

1536
01:08:58,790 --> 01:08:59,600
Pat.
Uh,

1537
01:08:59,601 --> 01:09:02,090
Dennis Bermudez who's fighting the 
animal.

1538
01:09:02,180 --> 01:09:03,050
Oh boy.
The,

1539
01:09:03,230 --> 01:09:05,890
the most exciting fighter in the UFC 
that no one talks about.

1540
01:09:07,100 --> 01:09:08,190
I'm confused.
You know,

1541
01:09:08,200 --> 01:09:12,760
when did the hundred 45 pound title 
picture gets sorted out.

1542
01:09:12,761 --> 01:09:16,220
Nobody starts talking.
Everyone's talking about cobb and wow.

1543
01:09:16,430 --> 01:09:21,160
Come conor mcgregor didn't get Dennis 
Bermudez for this.

1544
01:09:21,161 --> 01:09:23,700
A big Boston fight.
Why is he fighting Dennis seaver?

1545
01:09:23,740 --> 01:09:25,970
I see.
I think stylistically it's better.

1546
01:09:26,060 --> 01:09:29,760
They want to keep winning.
So match them up with a striker.

1547
01:09:30,380 --> 01:09:32,450
Who knows how to dig into.
This is a striker.

1548
01:09:32,510 --> 01:09:34,070
He's a striker and a wrestler.
Yeah,

1549
01:09:34,071 --> 01:09:37,610
but Dennis strikings fucking Dennis is 
probably have mma,

1550
01:09:37,611 --> 01:09:40,700
wrestling and mma.
Him and pat are are right up there.

1551
01:09:40,790 --> 01:09:42,980
I mean Dennis is.
Dennis is a nightmare.

1552
01:09:43,040 --> 01:09:45,200
Who's the fucking savage?
And so exciting.

1553
01:09:45,201 --> 01:09:50,201
Good luck to them.
Hispanic then this is going to be 

1554
01:09:50,201 --> 01:09:50,201
dentists can be cheeky.

1555
01:09:50,201 --> 01:09:50,420
I expected it to be champion and 12 
months.

1556
01:09:50,780 --> 01:09:55,780
Well I'm just A.
He's a weird one to be cause he's like 

1557
01:09:55,780 --> 01:09:59,151
this like a dark horse,
like he's the guy that people just are 

1558
01:09:59,151 --> 01:09:59,990
not talking about.
I just don't understand it.

1559
01:10:00,440 --> 01:10:05,440
I mean I think there's a legitimate 
reason when people were talking about 

1560
01:10:05,440 --> 01:10:05,440
cub,
Swanson and Frankie Uyghur and obviously

1561
01:10:05,440 --> 01:10:07,280
a legitimate reason why people are 
talking about conor.

1562
01:10:07,490 --> 01:10:10,400
Several reasons.
Charisma and skill,

1563
01:10:10,430 --> 01:10:11,430
you know all those.
He's got the.

1564
01:10:11,510 --> 01:10:13,010
In fact he's got it all.
Yeah,

1565
01:10:13,310 --> 01:10:18,310
but Bermudez is a fucking savage.
He's never lost in the FC except for 

1566
01:10:18,310 --> 01:10:19,710
that one fight with Diego Brandao every 
fight.

1567
01:10:19,711 --> 01:10:22,370
Since then he's won and he's looked 
better every time he's been out there.

1568
01:10:22,400 --> 01:10:25,040
On top of that,
he's won five performance bonuses.

1569
01:10:25,400 --> 01:10:28,910
These single most exciting fighter in 
the entire UFC.

1570
01:10:28,940 --> 01:10:30,170
So what the fuck is going on?

1571
01:10:30,350 --> 01:10:33,080
Sometimes it takes a while to catch on.
Is that what it is?

1572
01:10:33,140 --> 01:10:34,190
Yeah.
Well,

1573
01:10:34,220 --> 01:10:36,590
once they finally do catch on,
they're like,

1574
01:10:36,591 --> 01:10:41,591
oh yeah,
let's go back and watch his other 

1575
01:10:41,591 --> 01:10:41,591
fights.
Like,

1576
01:10:41,591 --> 01:10:43,681
Oh shit.
Within six months he's going to be a 

1577
01:10:43,681 --> 01:10:44,450
huge star in the UFC and it's actually.
I don't mind it.

1578
01:10:44,451 --> 01:10:46,550
I'm happy for him for it because it lets
them build.

1579
01:10:46,850 --> 01:10:48,410
He need.
He needed time.

1580
01:10:48,411 --> 01:10:50,840
He's got great coaching so he the way 
down this works.

1581
01:10:50,841 --> 01:10:55,841
He's,
he's his home base is on Long Island 

1582
01:10:55,841 --> 01:10:58,090
Transit,
Long Island in Miami and Belmont 

1583
01:10:58,090 --> 01:10:58,090
kickboxing,
fantastic coaches.

1584
01:10:58,090 --> 01:11:00,030
They're in good training partners there.
He starts his camps out with me and they

1585
01:11:00,050 --> 01:11:05,050
finishes with us out here.
So what dentists need to work on was 

1586
01:11:05,830 --> 01:11:10,830
this to cover new thing I've been doing 
over the past couple years is is pacing 

1587
01:11:10,830 --> 01:11:13,920
during a fight camp and finding an 
athlete's workload,

1588
01:11:13,950 --> 01:11:14,250
that's

1589
01:11:14,250 --> 01:11:19,250
very difficult to do to find out how 
much you can push someone when they 

1590
01:11:19,250 --> 01:11:20,790
start to pull back.
Everyone's not the same,

1591
01:11:20,900 --> 01:11:25,900
so now when guys start camps,
they get from me a schedule of eight 

1592
01:11:25,921 --> 01:11:30,921
weeks or however long that we have and 
that schedule is broken down in the 

1593
01:11:30,921 --> 01:11:34,280
weeks,
are color coded by intensity and also 

1594
01:11:34,280 --> 01:11:35,340
all their workouts are plotted out now 
that the plans never work out.

1595
01:11:36,280 --> 01:11:37,890
I'm a believer that all plans are 
useless,

1596
01:11:37,891 --> 01:11:41,270
but the acting of planning is essential.
There's so much that you,

1597
01:11:41,490 --> 01:11:46,490
that you derive from that.
So they can see how their whole eight 

1598
01:11:46,490 --> 01:11:49,821
weeks are going to look.
So Dennis had just took some time to 

1599
01:11:49,821 --> 01:11:49,821
find his,
his pacing,

1600
01:11:49,821 --> 01:11:51,360
and there's two fights that he.
That he.

1601
01:11:51,390 --> 01:11:56,390
There were real close for them.
I think it was Matt grice and maybe 

1602
01:11:56,390 --> 01:11:59,280
Holloway.
He was completely overtrain.

1603
01:11:59,281 --> 01:12:04,281
Coming into those fights,
I realized I had never seen an 

1604
01:12:04,281 --> 01:12:04,281
overtrained athlete before.

1605
01:12:04,281 --> 01:12:05,430
Dennis came out and looked at went,
oh,

1606
01:12:05,460 --> 01:12:07,980
okay.
So it was just healthy food,

1607
01:12:08,010 --> 01:12:09,780
ice baths,
some soft tissue work,

1608
01:12:09,781 --> 01:12:11,640
some light movement stuff to get him 
back.

1609
01:12:12,150 --> 01:12:16,410
How many days out?
I was two and a half weeks out.

1610
01:12:16,590 --> 01:12:18,440
Two and a half weeks ago.
He knew he was overtrained.

1611
01:12:18,490 --> 01:12:23,490
Oh totally.
I realize I realized I had never seen 

1612
01:12:23,490 --> 01:12:26,200
the look on his face.
I want when I was born,

1613
01:12:26,201 --> 01:12:30,720
his energy to what about heart rate?
Don't am.

1614
01:12:30,721 --> 01:12:32,940
I don't remember if I remember.
It was hard.

1615
01:12:32,941 --> 01:12:37,941
It was,
but it was a more general sense and 

1616
01:12:37,941 --> 01:12:37,941
feeling of somebody.
It's more,

1617
01:12:37,941 --> 01:12:38,190
you can take heart,
you could do all this stuff,

1618
01:12:38,191 --> 01:12:43,191
but the best you can to get is really 
looking at someone getting a sense of 

1619
01:12:43,191 --> 01:12:43,830
how they feel and that only comes with 
time,

1620
01:12:43,860 --> 01:12:48,860
so I have to take some like a year to 
really get to know an athlete and for 

1621
01:12:48,860 --> 01:12:52,230
them to know me and for us to kind of go
through these ups and downs together.

1622
01:12:52,230 --> 01:12:53,730
That always happened in everyone's 
career,

1623
01:12:54,060 --> 01:12:59,060
so that was Dennis has challenge is,
is finding his pacing during this camp 

1624
01:12:59,060 --> 01:13:02,901
and he's really got that data and we saw
that with clay and he went there and 

1625
01:13:02,901 --> 01:13:05,550
smash colleague that not even remotely 
competitive and now he's.

1626
01:13:05,640 --> 01:13:09,390
He's coming up again here in a couple of
weeks and who's he fighting llamas.

1627
01:13:09,700 --> 01:13:11,400
Ooh,
that's a good fight.

1628
01:13:11,510 --> 01:13:12,730
What if I.
What are,

1629
01:13:12,740 --> 01:13:14,960
what card is that?
Is the Mexico City cars.

1630
01:13:14,980 --> 01:13:17,050
He's always just under the co main 
events.

1631
01:13:17,080 --> 01:13:19,450
The UFC is now pushed him up to that 
level.

1632
01:13:19,740 --> 01:13:24,740
He'll,
he'll start getting lots of attention 

1633
01:13:24,740 --> 01:13:24,740
and he's.
He's a guy too.

1634
01:13:24,740 --> 01:13:27,000
That is as tough as any man.
If it was a thousand years ago.

1635
01:13:27,001 --> 01:13:29,820
Dennis is on the front front line with 
an ax in his hand for sure.

1636
01:13:29,821 --> 01:13:33,220
He's legitimate tough guy and he's 
smart.

1637
01:13:33,910 --> 01:13:38,910
He's super coachable and he listens,
which is a very rare trait in someone 

1638
01:13:38,910 --> 01:13:39,650
who's [inaudible].

1639
01:13:39,660 --> 01:13:44,660
It's usually they go the other way.
Usually you win a bunch of fights and 

1640
01:13:44,660 --> 01:13:47,151
you stopped doing everything.
Everything that you were doing 

1641
01:13:47,151 --> 01:13:47,151
beforehand.
Dennis hasn't taken that approach.

1642
01:13:47,151 --> 01:13:49,770
So for this one we worked with a company
called hypoxic.

1643
01:13:49,771 --> 01:13:54,771
Whoa.
He's been sleeping in an altitude tent 

1644
01:13:54,771 --> 01:13:54,771
for the past five weeks.
Simulating the elevation.

1645
01:13:54,820 --> 01:13:57,390
Right.
This is the highest elevation UFC ever.

1646
01:13:58,170 --> 01:13:59,610
7,000
plus feet.

1647
01:13:59,700 --> 01:14:01,200
Yeah.
So he has that to,

1648
01:14:01,220 --> 01:14:02,180
to help there.
He's got,

1649
01:14:02,190 --> 01:14:06,110
we use a normatec recovery systems to 
help kind of research.

1650
01:14:06,550 --> 01:14:08,590
Let's use compression leg.
Uh,

1651
01:14:09,290 --> 01:14:10,170
yeah,
I've seen those.

1652
01:14:10,230 --> 01:14:11,590
Yeah.
You were telling me about that,

1653
01:14:11,591 --> 01:14:13,420
but I've seen it on videos.
Yeah.

1654
01:14:13,421 --> 01:14:15,730
We've been using those for four years 
now.

1655
01:14:15,790 --> 01:14:18,250
It's an.
What's it do it basically,

1656
01:14:18,251 --> 01:14:23,251
it helps blood flow back to heart.
So when your heart squeezes that 

1657
01:14:23,251 --> 01:14:23,560
arterial blood is under high pressure,
so it squeezes,

1658
01:14:23,561 --> 01:14:24,010
it goes down.

1659
01:14:24,010 --> 01:14:25,860
By the time it gets to your venous 
system,

1660
01:14:25,880 --> 01:14:27,400
get returned to your heart.
It's low pressure.

1661
01:14:27,700 --> 01:14:32,700
So there's one way valves in your veins,
and when you walk in your muscles 

1662
01:14:32,700 --> 01:14:33,040
squeeze it helps pump the blood back up 
again.

1663
01:14:33,041 --> 01:14:34,900
There's a valve to get it back to your 
heart.

1664
01:14:35,770 --> 01:14:38,560
With the NORMATEC,
they looked like these big hockey pants.

1665
01:14:38,561 --> 01:14:43,561
It in flight,
starting at your foot and all the way 

1666
01:14:43,561 --> 01:14:45,481
up.
We have ones for the arms and the hips 

1667
01:14:45,481 --> 01:14:47,071
to and they help squeeze that blood and 
the lymphatic system back to your heart 

1668
01:14:47,080 --> 01:14:49,270
so you recover quicker and it's 
incredible.

1669
01:14:49,330 --> 01:14:54,330
You can take two,
three days if you go pump your legs for 

1670
01:14:54,330 --> 01:14:54,330
an hour or two,
it's like a day and a half for recovery.

1671
01:14:54,610 --> 01:14:57,400
Really much difference.
Huge difference.

1672
01:14:57,401 --> 01:15:00,070
I go several years ago,
I first got one to test out.

1673
01:15:00,071 --> 01:15:02,260
I squatted,
I wasn't in great shape.

1674
01:15:02,260 --> 01:15:05,170
I squatted heavy.
I ran for an hour and did sprints.

1675
01:15:05,171 --> 01:15:10,171
I should have been wrecked.
I pumped for three hours watching a 

1676
01:15:10,171 --> 01:15:10,240
movie on the TV at night,
got up the next morning.

1677
01:15:10,241 --> 01:15:13,540
I had no soreness in my legs.
My ass was super sore,

1678
01:15:13,660 --> 01:15:16,270
but it didn't.
We didn't have the hip one yet.

1679
01:15:16,271 --> 01:15:18,400
So it only came up to your height to 
your thighs?

1680
01:15:18,670 --> 01:15:20,950
No,
like it really made me rethink healing.

1681
01:15:20,951 --> 01:15:23,920
An injury is maybe it's nothing more 
than circulation issues.

1682
01:15:24,070 --> 01:15:25,020
Really?
Mm hmm.

1683
01:15:26,050 --> 01:15:28,540
What about cryotherapy?
If you guys mess around with that?

1684
01:15:28,630 --> 01:15:31,180
Yeah,
we do a cold plunges,

1685
01:15:31,510 --> 01:15:36,510
cold plunges size paths.
Have you seen those cryo chambers that 

1686
01:15:36,510 --> 01:15:37,120
there?
I've been to one.

1687
01:15:37,121 --> 01:15:39,100
We tested it out.
I didn't get a whole lot out of it.

1688
01:15:39,360 --> 01:15:44,360
Well,
did you go to the one that got his neck 

1689
01:15:44,360 --> 01:15:44,360
down or the one that you step into your 
whole body?

1690
01:15:44,360 --> 01:15:46,380
It's the long as good.
I've done both.

1691
01:15:46,590 --> 01:15:50,370
The neck down is okay,
but the whole body one is fucking legit.

1692
01:15:50,480 --> 01:15:54,000
Were the one you have to put on a face 
mask and your mom haven't done that.

1693
01:15:54,240 --> 01:15:56,820
I want to show you.
It will bring it to the place in La.

1694
01:15:56,870 --> 01:15:59,130
Croix healthcare in La is fucking 
amazing.

1695
01:15:59,131 --> 01:16:01,980
250 degrees below zero and you go in for
three minutes,

1696
01:16:02,130 --> 01:16:04,020
he'd get out,
you get on an elliptical machine,

1697
01:16:04,021 --> 01:16:09,021
you warm up for like five,
10 minutes and then you go back in for 

1698
01:16:09,021 --> 01:16:11,910
another 350 below zero and it's,
it feels like 250 below zero.

1699
01:16:11,911 --> 01:16:13,620
The other ones don't feel like it.
It's like,

1700
01:16:13,830 --> 01:16:14,910
yeah,
I'm cold down there,

1701
01:16:14,911 --> 01:16:17,760
but my head's not cold so it's not that.
It's just not the same,

1702
01:16:18,150 --> 01:16:22,590
but this one when you get out,
once you get out of it,

1703
01:16:22,591 --> 01:16:25,260
it's like your whole body just like 
fucking electrical.

1704
01:16:25,261 --> 01:16:29,220
It's like things are crackling because 
you know your skin is 39 degrees.

1705
01:16:29,221 --> 01:16:32,000
I mean you're on the verge of dying and 
then what?

1706
01:16:32,940 --> 01:16:35,480
Go back until you have to do things like
this.

1707
01:16:35,520 --> 01:16:38,870
Recovery is completely overlooked in 
this sport.

1708
01:16:38,871 --> 01:16:43,871
I think subway,
overtraining is rampant and recovery is 

1709
01:16:43,871 --> 01:16:43,871
not nearly what it needs to.

1710
01:16:43,871 --> 01:16:43,871
Yeah.
That is a.

1711
01:16:43,871 --> 01:16:46,430
that's an issue with amateur wrestling 
as well,

1712
01:16:46,490 --> 01:16:47,870
right?
I mean amateur wrestling,

1713
01:16:48,200 --> 01:16:49,460
almost all the athletes over

1714
01:16:49,510 --> 01:16:51,600
trained.
By the time I was 21,

1715
01:16:51,601 --> 01:16:53,310
I was done.
My neck was so messed up.

1716
01:16:53,311 --> 01:16:55,830
I was finished.
Yeah,

1717
01:16:55,831 --> 01:16:58,210
I mean amateur wrestling is also.
You're also 18,

1718
01:16:58,211 --> 01:16:58,980
19,
20,

1719
01:16:58,981 --> 01:16:59,530
20,
you know,

1720
01:16:59,760 --> 01:17:02,520
you can do a lot of things at that age.
So here,

1721
01:17:02,521 --> 01:17:05,190
here's my warm up at 19.
Ready.

1722
01:17:05,340 --> 01:17:07,410
Let's go as a 19 year old,
warm up.

1723
01:17:07,411 --> 01:17:12,411
Now it doesn't work like that.
That's probably how you got your neck 

1724
01:17:12,411 --> 01:17:12,411
fucked up to that for sure.
Yeah,

1725
01:17:12,411 --> 01:17:16,920
but you have to look at it.
That's why if you're going to work with 

1726
01:17:16,920 --> 01:17:16,920
an athlete,
you have to be thinking,

1727
01:17:16,920 --> 01:17:20,501
okay,
we want you to go in belt and defend it 

1728
01:17:20,501 --> 01:17:20,501
seven,
eight times.

1729
01:17:20,501 --> 01:17:21,260
You can make a bunch of money and not 
have to work again.

1730
01:17:21,500 --> 01:17:23,120
He hasn't been thinking about that in 
the beginning.

1731
01:17:23,600 --> 01:17:26,150
You can't wait until that happened and 
then try to do it.

1732
01:17:26,150 --> 01:17:29,480
All of a sudden if you're a guy like we 
had this guy fought in the UFC,

1733
01:17:29,481 --> 01:17:30,910
used to train with us and he'd always 
come.

1734
01:17:30,950 --> 01:17:34,190
I did 10 rounds today and I always had 
the same response,

1735
01:17:34,430 --> 01:17:36,480
how many runs you're fight,
he [inaudible],

1736
01:17:36,960 --> 01:17:41,960
I'm gonna Kinda look at them.
We never kind of never really got that 

1737
01:17:41,960 --> 01:17:45,470
and as a result his body was done at 
some other issues in his career is over,

1738
01:17:45,770 --> 01:17:50,770
so unless you look at the overall 
overall arc of your career and how much 

1739
01:17:50,770 --> 01:17:52,790
you're going to push your body,
you only have so much.

1740
01:17:53,840 --> 01:17:55,430
You only have.
You can only do so much.

1741
01:17:55,480 --> 01:17:57,440
It's hard to tell young Fargo,
isn't it,

1742
01:17:57,880 --> 01:18:00,920
that you only have so much in the 
pullback?

1743
01:18:01,070 --> 01:18:03,500
Don't push as hard.
There's a way to tell it.

1744
01:18:03,710 --> 01:18:04,850
Here's,
here's a great example.

1745
01:18:04,851 --> 01:18:08,070
I have my first female who's just signed
to the ascent,

1746
01:18:08,071 --> 01:18:13,071
name's Kyle and current and she came at 
terrain about a year ago and she was.

1747
01:18:13,490 --> 01:18:14,600
What happens?
A lot of people,

1748
01:18:14,601 --> 01:18:15,470
you know,
she's in the class.

1749
01:18:15,471 --> 01:18:16,880
No one's working with her and she 
approached.

1750
01:18:16,960 --> 01:18:20,390
I liked her from the beginning.
There's something about I value my first

1751
01:18:20,391 --> 01:18:22,730
evaluation.
Mathlete is purely emotional.

1752
01:18:22,731 --> 01:18:27,731
I look at them,
I can usually tell if they're going to 

1753
01:18:27,731 --> 01:18:29,381
be good this quickly.
Whole bunch of other things has to 

1754
01:18:29,381 --> 01:18:29,381
happen.
I have to see work ethic.

1755
01:18:29,381 --> 01:18:31,100
We have to have a connection.
I have to be passionate about them,

1756
01:18:31,101 --> 01:18:33,260
they have to connect with me,
all these things have to happen,

1757
01:18:33,620 --> 01:18:35,540
but she had something special from the 
beginning,

1758
01:18:35,541 --> 01:18:39,410
but I didn't spend a whole lot of time 
with her and she asked me to manager and

1759
01:18:40,130 --> 01:18:42,380
even though there was no future for the 
UFC,

1760
01:18:42,381 --> 01:18:44,020
didn't have a,
a,

1761
01:18:44,050 --> 01:18:49,050
a division in her weight class.
I found myself saying yes and kind of 

1762
01:18:49,050 --> 01:18:49,050
started this development process with 
her,

1763
01:18:49,050 --> 01:18:53,860
so we started really five months ago and
we threw away everything that she was 

1764
01:18:53,860 --> 01:18:53,860
doing.

1765
01:18:53,860 --> 01:18:55,490
She had never really trained before,
but if you look at it,

1766
01:18:55,491 --> 01:19:00,491
if you pull a picture up,
she's really put together a beautiful 

1767
01:19:00,491 --> 01:19:00,491
girl.
She's super strong,

1768
01:19:00,491 --> 01:19:01,070
great house,
but didn't,

1769
01:19:01,130 --> 01:19:04,490
didn't really know how to use all this.
Let me start from the beginning.

1770
01:19:04,491 --> 01:19:04,970
I said,
listen,

1771
01:19:04,971 --> 01:19:06,170
give,
give me four months.

1772
01:19:06,320 --> 01:19:10,130
Here's what we're gonna do come October.
Wait to see how good you are and here we

1773
01:19:10,131 --> 01:19:12,320
are in now the October,
November.

1774
01:19:12,321 --> 01:19:14,270
She's incredible art now.
She to debut in November,

1775
01:19:14,271 --> 01:19:17,750
20 seconds against Paige vanzant and we 
took the same approach.

1776
01:19:18,170 --> 01:19:20,570
What works for you today?
What's her background?

1777
01:19:20,571 --> 01:19:23,740
Initially she wrestled in high school 
and she's got a striking background.

1778
01:19:23,760 --> 01:19:27,440
He's got a beautiful striking style.
It's pretty rare to have a chick russell

1779
01:19:27,441 --> 01:19:28,430
in high school,
right?

1780
01:19:28,490 --> 01:19:29,840
Yeah.
Well she's from Hawaii.

1781
01:19:29,841 --> 01:19:31,160
They all seem to like the fight over 
there,

1782
01:19:31,161 --> 01:19:32,780
but she's,
she's.

1783
01:19:33,140 --> 01:19:38,140
She could be a big star in the UFC,
but we took the same development 

1784
01:19:38,140 --> 01:19:38,510
approach,
so what I need to find out was because I

1785
01:19:38,511 --> 01:19:43,511
got a sense that she really hadn't had.
She'd never had structured training 

1786
01:19:43,511 --> 01:19:46,901
camps before.
She just kind of go workout and then go 

1787
01:19:46,901 --> 01:19:47,540
fight.
So I took on two different sessions over

1788
01:19:47,541 --> 01:19:48,200
the summer.
I said,

1789
01:19:48,201 --> 01:19:53,201
okay,
well we're going to take the next three 

1790
01:19:53,201 --> 01:19:53,201
weeks.
I'm gonna Really gonna push you.

1791
01:19:53,201 --> 01:19:54,380
And I found out where's her limit,
went to her body,

1792
01:19:54,381 --> 01:19:59,381
start pulling back.
When did emotionally she start kind of 

1793
01:19:59,381 --> 01:19:59,381
turning off a little bit and then we.
When we did that twice,

1794
01:19:59,540 --> 01:20:04,540
so when it came into this fight camp,
I had a real good sense of how much I 

1795
01:20:04,540 --> 01:20:08,010
could push her and when we should pull 
her back and makes all the difference.

1796
01:20:08,011 --> 01:20:13,011
When you're developing an athlete,
it's just hard to find someone who's 

1797
01:20:13,011 --> 01:20:13,740
willing to put that kind of attention to
someone's career.

1798
01:20:14,320 --> 01:20:16,380
It's.
There's very few people who do it.

1799
01:20:16,381 --> 01:20:21,381
That's why I said the talent pool and 
Emma is not very big because we don't 

1800
01:20:21,381 --> 01:20:25,821
have structured training environments 
like a professional team that's got an 

1801
01:20:25,821 --> 01:20:27,720
Ortho there at practice that has 
physical therapists there.

1802
01:20:27,750 --> 01:20:32,750
They.
It's so it's my job to put that 

1803
01:20:32,750 --> 01:20:32,750
together,
so we'll do.

1804
01:20:32,750 --> 01:20:32,860
I have a sports psychologist I work 
with.

1805
01:20:33,000 --> 01:20:34,530
If you can,
I'm going to work with you.

1806
01:20:34,531 --> 01:20:36,840
I'm going to match you and we're going 
to start looking at your training.

1807
01:20:37,120 --> 01:20:39,430
A manager should be involved with the 
training manager,

1808
01:20:39,450 --> 01:20:41,110
should have relationships with the 
coaches,

1809
01:20:41,130 --> 01:20:44,580
making sure that their athlete,
that that is your advocate.

1810
01:20:45,550 --> 01:20:50,550
I have relationships with doctors.
If someone needs a to see an orthopedic 

1811
01:20:50,550 --> 01:20:54,231
surgeon,
we work with one of the best orthopedic 

1812
01:20:54,231 --> 01:20:54,231
surgeons,
a two month wait to get in.

1813
01:20:54,231 --> 01:20:54,231
Well,
they get in within two days.

1814
01:20:54,690 --> 01:20:59,690
If you need a sports psychologist,
we're going to make sure that happens 

1815
01:20:59,690 --> 01:20:59,690
for you.
If you have to see a dermatologist,

1816
01:20:59,690 --> 01:21:03,501
we're going to get you in immediately to
make sure that happens because the goal 

1817
01:21:03,501 --> 01:21:06,711
is not what sponsor did you get me today
at this goal is I want you to go when I 

1818
01:21:07,111 --> 01:21:10,380
want you to win a belt so nike calls us 
not so.

1819
01:21:10,381 --> 01:21:15,381
Some little sponsor's going to give you 
an extra 1500 bucks for this fight free 

1820
01:21:15,381 --> 01:21:15,510
refrigerator.
Yeah,

1821
01:21:15,511 --> 01:21:16,260
okay,
great.

1822
01:21:16,890 --> 01:21:21,890
But unfortunately that's the mentality 
that most fighters have that most camps 

1823
01:21:21,890 --> 01:21:24,120
have and it's not that these trainers 
don't care about their guys.

1824
01:21:24,360 --> 01:21:25,860
If you're running a gym,
right,

1825
01:21:26,520 --> 01:21:28,500
the fighters not going to bring money 
into your gym,

1826
01:21:28,501 --> 01:21:33,501
you have to divert your attention to 
running classes and all the other 

1827
01:21:33,501 --> 01:21:34,660
things.
If you have 40 fighters in there,

1828
01:21:35,310 --> 01:21:38,040
you can't give all them the same 
attention that they deserve,

1829
01:21:38,190 --> 01:21:43,190
so you really have to pick favorites and
you really have to get behind your 

1830
01:21:43,190 --> 01:21:44,460
athlete and give them every opportunity 
that they can have to win.

1831
01:21:44,780 --> 01:21:49,780
Do you foresee perhaps developing a team
of people under you that do similar 

1832
01:21:50,331 --> 01:21:53,360
things so you can broaden your approach 
and pick more athletes?

1833
01:21:53,361 --> 01:21:58,361
Or do you think that the talent pool of 
potential champions is so small that if 

1834
01:21:58,361 --> 01:22:02,591
you did that,
it would almost be like a point of 

1835
01:22:02,591 --> 01:22:02,591
diminishing returns?

1836
01:22:02,591 --> 01:22:03,080
I Dunno.
I mean that's hard to say.

1837
01:22:03,081 --> 01:22:08,081
I have a great team around me.
I've prayed for striking coaches that I 

1838
01:22:08,081 --> 01:22:08,360
work with.
Who Do you work with?

1839
01:22:08,361 --> 01:22:11,670
Struggling coaches.
I'm not sure men are is.

1840
01:22:11,720 --> 01:22:13,820
We've worked together for a jar 12 
years.

1841
01:22:13,821 --> 01:22:15,740
Danny Perez has done our boxing for 
years.

1842
01:22:15,741 --> 01:22:20,741
He got the king most started recently 
with Antony hardonk in La Shit and they 

1843
01:22:21,891 --> 01:22:24,410
all have different approaches to things 
and again,

1844
01:22:24,411 --> 01:22:29,411
part of my job as their manager is to 
help them develop relationships with 

1845
01:22:29,411 --> 01:22:31,410
other coaches because Emma made their 
camp inboxing.

1846
01:22:31,430 --> 01:22:32,600
You can be the guy,
right?

1847
01:22:32,601 --> 01:22:37,601
You can be the one guy in mma.
There's too many things that have to 

1848
01:22:37,601 --> 01:22:40,451
happen.
So my job is to introduce people and 

1849
01:22:40,451 --> 01:22:40,451
help them develop relationships so they 
can.

1850
01:22:40,451 --> 01:22:44,890
I want you to have a relationship with 
your striking coach and your strength 

1851
01:22:44,890 --> 01:22:44,890
and conditioning coach and all this type
of thing.

1852
01:22:45,110 --> 01:22:50,110
This is how you really have a great team
of people that I work with with these 

1853
01:22:50,110 --> 01:22:55,061
guys,
and then I kind of oversee things I've 

1854
01:22:55,061 --> 01:22:55,061
never worked

1855
01:22:55,061 --> 01:22:57,460
start with her dog,
but I want to because he's got some 

1856
01:22:57,460 --> 01:22:57,460
really unique ideas about,
uh,

1857
01:22:57,460 --> 01:22:57,970
Emma.
First of all,

1858
01:22:58,420 --> 01:23:03,420
great kickboxer and some of the best leg
kick technique ever seen in the UFC 

1859
01:23:03,420 --> 01:23:04,420
fantastic leg kicks.

1860
01:23:04,810 --> 01:23:07,140
It's,
he teaches them very different.

1861
01:23:07,150 --> 01:23:12,150
He,
his whole style of teaching is a very 

1862
01:23:12,150 --> 01:23:12,150
different guy,
a very unique point of view.

1863
01:23:12,150 --> 01:23:12,150
Yeah,
that's what I was saying.

1864
01:23:12,150 --> 01:23:14,200
He doesn't,
he doesn't believe in head movement.

1865
01:23:14,660 --> 01:23:17,120
Hit Him and um,
and Mark Della Grotta.

1866
01:23:17,130 --> 01:23:22,130
We're going on it when we're in Vegas.
Not aggressively just debating back and 

1867
01:23:22,130 --> 01:23:22,910
forth because,
uh,

1868
01:23:23,170 --> 01:23:25,560
I don't believe in the head movement to 
move.

1869
01:23:25,780 --> 01:23:28,390
He's like,
he has this weird philosophy about,

1870
01:23:28,420 --> 01:23:33,420
you know,
not taking your head off the center 

1871
01:23:33,420 --> 01:23:35,731
line.
Like I don't know what his approach is 

1872
01:23:35,731 --> 01:23:35,731
based on balance.
He doesn't ever want,

1873
01:23:35,731 --> 01:23:37,200
want you to be in a position where 
you're out of balance.

1874
01:23:37,860 --> 01:23:39,700
Well then how do you explain the guy 
like dominick Cruz,

1875
01:23:39,940 --> 01:23:44,260
who's all head movement and is a fucking
monster is always to do it right,

1876
01:23:44,261 --> 01:23:46,120
and that's why my.
My approach isn't,

1877
01:23:46,150 --> 01:23:47,200
does that Ryan's way?

1878
01:23:47,200 --> 01:23:48,490
This is the way that we're going to do 
it.

1879
01:23:48,491 --> 01:23:50,260
My way is,
okay Joe,

1880
01:23:50,290 --> 01:23:51,910
here's your body type,
here's your background,

1881
01:23:51,911 --> 01:23:53,260
here's what you feel most comfortable 
with.

1882
01:23:53,261 --> 01:23:55,810
Here's your natural style.
What can we do?

1883
01:23:55,811 --> 01:23:57,820
What feels best for you?
We can go this direction.

1884
01:23:57,821 --> 01:23:58,480
What?
What do you like?

1885
01:23:58,660 --> 01:24:00,430
This feels better.
Let's go in this direction.

1886
01:24:00,431 --> 01:24:05,431
So if you gotta go cubs wants news,
wild and energetic and very 

1887
01:24:05,431 --> 01:24:07,900
unpredictable and creative in there,
you would enforce that for sure.

1888
01:24:07,960 --> 01:24:08,530
Yeah.
You know,

1889
01:24:08,560 --> 01:24:11,110
I started before he got hurt.
I started working with Goya.

1890
01:24:11,111 --> 01:24:14,530
We just had in the beginning and go 
though Eric Pres.

1891
01:24:14,740 --> 01:24:15,280
Oh,
okay.

1892
01:24:15,281 --> 01:24:15,880
Yeah,
yeah.

1893
01:24:16,090 --> 01:24:18,730
And the whole thing would go crazy.
It was crazy.

1894
01:24:18,731 --> 01:24:19,440
You know,
he even said,

1895
01:24:19,450 --> 01:24:20,680
coach,
I'm crazy and I work.

1896
01:24:20,710 --> 01:24:21,940
I said,
you're not.

1897
01:24:21,970 --> 01:24:23,740
I think he had been told he's crazy so 
much.

1898
01:24:23,850 --> 01:24:24,880
He started to believe,
oh,

1899
01:24:24,881 --> 01:24:25,360
I'm crazy.

1900
01:24:25,360 --> 01:24:28,570
And what were like wild and won't follow
a plan and all this different.

1901
01:24:28,571 --> 01:24:32,020
So I was kind of expecting that of him,
but he was the complete opposite.

1902
01:24:32,260 --> 01:24:37,260
He was super coachable,
follow the plan and did all those 

1903
01:24:37,260 --> 01:24:37,260
things.
So it's,

1904
01:24:37,260 --> 01:24:38,650
it's not only the technical side of 
things,

1905
01:24:38,651 --> 01:24:41,470
it's helping someone understand how they
fit in,

1906
01:24:41,740 --> 01:24:44,120
in helping them understand themselves a 
little bit better too.

1907
01:24:44,630 --> 01:24:46,990
So if you've only heard that you're 
crazy,

1908
01:24:47,610 --> 01:24:49,630
well that becomes a self fulfilling 
prophecy.

1909
01:24:49,631 --> 01:24:54,631
All of a sudden maybe you don't start 
falling game plans and things like you 

1910
01:24:54,631 --> 01:24:56,470
would've said no,
he's actually a super disciplined,

1911
01:24:56,471 --> 01:25:01,471
hardworking guy who needs a bit of 
guidance and structure in this 

1912
01:25:01,471 --> 01:25:04,201
particular way.
How I'd work with is totally different 

1913
01:25:04,201 --> 01:25:04,310
than Pat Goya's,
younger Kyland's,

1914
01:25:04,320 --> 01:25:09,320
a 23 year old female.
I have to work with her different than 

1915
01:25:09,320 --> 01:25:09,460
pat who's a 33 year old guys,
had,

1916
01:25:09,970 --> 01:25:11,230
you know,
more experience.

1917
01:25:11,230 --> 01:25:16,230
And she has,
does a big thing that happens with 

1918
01:25:16,230 --> 01:25:16,230
fighters.
Um,

1919
01:25:16,230 --> 01:25:19,630
and it's the relationships that they 
have outside of fighting,

1920
01:25:19,631 --> 01:25:24,550
sabotaging their fighting careers.
It's a fucking huge thing cause fighters

1921
01:25:25,580 --> 01:25:29,950
is incredibly emotionally involved thing
to do with your life.

1922
01:25:30,020 --> 01:25:32,860
There's so much involved in winning and 
losing.

1923
01:25:32,861 --> 01:25:37,861
The highs are so high.
The lows are so low and they oftentimes 

1924
01:25:37,861 --> 01:25:41,521
seek comfort in relationships like 
girlfriends that you can't live without.

1925
01:25:42,160 --> 01:25:47,160
Boyfriends he can't live without and I 
think that for the female fighters it's 

1926
01:25:47,160 --> 01:25:50,890
probably even more difficult because 
unless they're fighting,

1927
01:25:50,891 --> 01:25:55,891
like as a female fighter develops and 
grows and gets to like a place where 

1928
01:25:55,891 --> 01:25:59,401
she's perhaps challenging for a 
championship unless she's dating a 

1929
01:25:59,401 --> 01:26:03,571
similar level fighter who can kind of 
relate the guy she's

1930
01:26:04,190 --> 01:26:05,450
dating.
A Guy I've never heard of.

1931
01:26:05,451 --> 01:26:06,940
A fucking woman was a fighter dating 
guys,

1932
01:26:06,941 --> 01:26:08,750
not a fighter.
Have you heard of it?

1933
01:26:09,110 --> 01:26:10,870
I've never heard of it.
I never thought about that.

1934
01:26:11,420 --> 01:26:16,420
CAITLIN's fortunate.
Her boyfriend is a professional surfer 

1935
01:26:16,420 --> 01:26:18,110
for now.
What do you mean?

1936
01:26:18,320 --> 01:26:20,660
Once she starts kicking people's asses 
in the UFC,

1937
01:26:21,050 --> 01:26:26,050
I'm fucking moving up the ladder and 
this surfer dude sitting on the 

1938
01:26:26,050 --> 01:26:28,010
sidelines going,
I guess anything's possible,

1939
01:26:28,011 --> 01:26:31,610
but yet they're there to really,
really solid good people.

1940
01:26:31,700 --> 01:26:33,100
That's her right there.
Yeah,

1941
01:26:33,860 --> 01:26:38,860
she's beautiful.
She's going to be a huge star in her 

1942
01:26:38,860 --> 01:26:38,860
chest.
Um,

1943
01:26:38,860 --> 01:26:40,730
it's some type of religious,
uh,

1944
01:26:41,180 --> 01:26:42,650
saying,
okay.

1945
01:26:42,910 --> 01:26:44,300
Um,
but yeah,

1946
01:26:44,330 --> 01:26:49,330
the,
the trouble that if you have someone 

1947
01:26:49,330 --> 01:26:49,330
who's super talented almost all the 
time,

1948
01:26:49,330 --> 01:26:51,320
it's not what happens in the kitchen or 
in the gym.

1949
01:26:51,321 --> 01:26:53,840
It's their challenge.
It's everything that happens afterwards.

1950
01:26:53,870 --> 01:26:58,870
Yeah.
The friends that he grew up with are 

1951
01:26:58,870 --> 01:27:00,581
still kind of fucking up and holding 
them back and then it's the all the 

1952
01:27:00,581 --> 01:27:00,581
hangar.

1953
01:27:00,581 --> 01:27:00,990
As soon as you get famous enough to see 
all that,

1954
01:27:01,050 --> 01:27:06,050
you'll get phone calls from all sorts of
weird people who promise you weird 

1955
01:27:06,050 --> 01:27:06,050
things.
Like I had a fighter,

1956
01:27:06,050 --> 01:27:07,220
it got pretty famous.
All of a sudden he,

1957
01:27:07,610 --> 01:27:09,640
this manager is calling.
I have multiple,

1958
01:27:10,070 --> 01:27:12,650
multiple sponsors with fortune 500 
companies.

1959
01:27:13,280 --> 01:27:14,570
Okay.
I've got,

1960
01:27:14,571 --> 01:27:15,500
of course it's,
it's,

1961
01:27:15,730 --> 01:27:16,920
it's all bullshit,
but you'll get,

1962
01:27:16,950 --> 01:27:20,420
as soon as someone gets famous,
you'll have 50 people in your ear.

1963
01:27:20,450 --> 01:27:22,700
By the way,
there isn't a single fortune 500 company

1964
01:27:22,701 --> 01:27:24,410
that sponsors fighters.
I know.

1965
01:27:24,870 --> 01:27:25,610
Yeah.
I mean,

1966
01:27:25,970 --> 01:27:28,520
but been Nike's probably a fortune 500 
company,

1967
01:27:28,521 --> 01:27:29,100
right?
Yeah.

1968
01:27:29,150 --> 01:27:30,770
So it was probably 90.
That's about it.

1969
01:27:31,490 --> 01:27:34,960
But again,
fortune 500 company with multiple,

1970
01:27:35,390 --> 01:27:37,780
I don't even know how to have this 
conversation with you,

1971
01:27:37,781 --> 01:27:38,630
right?
Fortune 500,

1972
01:27:38,631 --> 01:27:39,580
I think it is,
right?

1973
01:27:40,170 --> 01:27:44,630
There's like fortune 500 and Nike's top 
corporations in the world,

1974
01:27:44,631 --> 01:27:45,590
right?
That's what it means.

1975
01:27:48,010 --> 01:27:49,010
Yeah,
there you go.

1976
01:27:49,600 --> 01:27:50,950
So anyway,
so what happened?

1977
01:27:50,951 --> 01:27:53,690
So someone will get famous and all of a 
sudden everyone,

1978
01:27:53,780 --> 01:27:55,730
you should be doing this,
why aren't you doing this?

1979
01:27:55,731 --> 01:27:58,760
You shouldn't be doing that.
And all of a sudden that chatter becomes

1980
01:27:58,761 --> 01:28:00,770
too much and people spin off.
I mean it happens.

1981
01:28:01,160 --> 01:28:03,380
It's more common than,
than not.

1982
01:28:03,580 --> 01:28:05,420
Right?
So when you start to get famous,

1983
01:28:05,480 --> 01:28:07,250
most likely you're going to do all the.
I like,

1984
01:28:07,251 --> 01:28:09,210
I liked the exam,
the port mortem post mortem of,

1985
01:28:09,211 --> 01:28:10,640
of someone's career and go,
okay,

1986
01:28:10,641 --> 01:28:12,620
here's everything you did right.
Here's all the things you did wrong.

1987
01:28:13,040 --> 01:28:15,800
It's shocking how many people go,
okay,

1988
01:28:15,801 --> 01:28:17,420
we'll do the same thing over and over 
again.

1989
01:28:17,780 --> 01:28:19,490
Like I mentioned,
if you were selling a widget,

1990
01:28:19,670 --> 01:28:24,670
you're selling this and you sold 10 
million of them by these sales channels 

1991
01:28:24,670 --> 01:28:25,590
with this marketing plan and this color.

1992
01:28:25,590 --> 01:28:27,630
And this was your biggest one and you 
sold 10 million.

1993
01:28:27,631 --> 01:28:30,290
Then we went,
I'm going to sell on a different shape,

1994
01:28:30,300 --> 01:28:31,910
a different color in a totally different
way.

1995
01:28:31,911 --> 01:28:33,590
I mean,
it would in a business sense,

1996
01:28:33,591 --> 01:28:38,591
that would be ridiculous.
But this happens all the time with 

1997
01:28:38,591 --> 01:28:38,591
fighters.
With fighters.

1998
01:28:38,591 --> 01:28:39,260
Yeah.
How does that work?

1999
01:28:39,261 --> 01:28:42,010
Like say what if you had a fight?
Like let's,

2000
01:28:42,011 --> 01:28:45,200
let's look at Chris Weidman's first 
fight with Anderson Silva.

2001
01:28:45,230 --> 01:28:48,010
Now I'm John Donahoe,
who's a brilliant guy.

2002
01:28:48,050 --> 01:28:50,930
Who's the trainer?
First thing Donna says,

2003
01:28:50,931 --> 01:28:53,120
when I go into the cage,
I said congratulations.

2004
01:28:53,121 --> 01:28:58,121
And he goes,
I don't like how he's getting hit with 

2005
01:28:58,121 --> 01:28:58,121
those leg kicks.
Those,

2006
01:28:58,121 --> 01:28:58,940
the first thing he said.
So we've really got to work on that.

2007
01:28:59,320 --> 01:29:00,710
That was the first thing out of his 
mouth.

2008
01:29:00,800 --> 01:29:04,120
So what happens in the second fight?
Weidman checks the leg kicks and breaks.

2009
01:29:04,121 --> 01:29:05,230
Anderson's like,
yeah,

2010
01:29:05,270 --> 01:29:08,160
I mean literally checked,
no leg kicks.

2011
01:29:08,160 --> 01:29:10,950
The first fight,
broke Anderson's leg in the second fight

2012
01:29:10,951 --> 01:29:15,951
with leg kicks.
But it's that kind of a trainer that 

2013
01:29:15,951 --> 01:29:18,411
looks at you having the most insane 
victory maybe ever in the middleweight 

2014
01:29:19,321 --> 01:29:24,321
division.
You're fighting the greatest of all 

2015
01:29:24,321 --> 01:29:24,321
time,
who?

2016
01:29:24,321 --> 01:29:24,930
Clowns,
people hate clowns.

2017
01:29:24,931 --> 01:29:29,931
You and you fucking blast him into 
another dimension with a left hook and 

2018
01:29:30,121 --> 01:29:35,121
then basketball his head off the ground.
I stepped into the cage moments later 

2019
01:29:35,121 --> 01:29:39,561
and the first thing the trainer says is,
I don't like how he's getting hit with 

2020
01:29:39,561 --> 01:29:39,660
all his leg kicks.
Like that's the kind of motherfucker you

2021
01:29:39,661 --> 01:29:44,661
want training you.
You want a guy who's not like the kids 

2022
01:29:44,661 --> 01:29:45,930
the best ever.
He's the pest here though.

2023
01:29:45,960 --> 01:29:48,980
No one's got a peach.
Your kid show the best.

2024
01:29:49,280 --> 01:29:51,960
You know you don't want that guy.
You want the guy who's saying,

2025
01:29:51,961 --> 01:29:56,961
okay,
let's look at what you did right and 

2026
01:29:56,961 --> 01:29:56,961
let's look at what,
what was horribly wrong?

2027
01:29:57,630 --> 01:30:00,210
It depends on the athlete,
how you approach that.

2028
01:30:00,510 --> 01:30:01,410
That's the thing,
right?

2029
01:30:01,411 --> 01:30:03,570
It's everyone's different.
Maybe with Chris Weidman,

2030
01:30:03,571 --> 01:30:05,400
I don't know him well.
We had lunch one time.

2031
01:30:05,410 --> 01:30:07,620
He's real nice guy.
I've never worked with him,

2032
01:30:07,980 --> 01:30:10,200
but you have to talk to everybody 
differently.

2033
01:30:10,260 --> 01:30:11,670
Everyone is not the same.
Well,

2034
01:30:11,671 --> 01:30:15,930
you're a funny dude too,
because you're not a schmoozer.

2035
01:30:16,320 --> 01:30:17,160
You're,
you're,

2036
01:30:17,190 --> 01:30:21,750
you're a real no bullshit kind of guy 
and some people are not good with that.

2037
01:30:22,020 --> 01:30:24,720
Now a lot of people aren't and that's,
well,

2038
01:30:24,721 --> 01:30:29,721
you've had relationships with fighters.
Were they like it a certain point in 

2039
01:30:29,721 --> 01:30:29,721
time?
It's like,

2040
01:30:29,721 --> 01:30:29,721
okay,
we can't do this anymore.

2041
01:30:29,790 --> 01:30:32,160
And successful guys in.
All right,

2042
01:30:32,220 --> 01:30:33,720
well we,
we gave it a shot,

2043
01:30:33,990 --> 01:30:38,990
but it's just they didn't want to listen
to what you were saying and they would 

2044
01:30:38,990 --> 01:30:39,180
like question like,
who the fuck are you,

2045
01:30:39,181 --> 01:30:41,910
you know,
even how to fight and that kind of Shit,

2046
01:30:41,911 --> 01:30:42,320
right?

2047
01:30:42,330 --> 01:30:46,710
It happens after big wins,
which is the odd part about it.

2048
01:30:47,470 --> 01:30:50,790
Like I had a guy who went to big fights,
he came in the room and show technique.

2049
01:30:50,791 --> 01:30:52,380
He looked the other way.
He was done.

2050
01:30:52,840 --> 01:30:55,980
I'm not listening to you anymore.
Wow.

2051
01:30:56,010 --> 01:31:00,600
Career didn't go well after that,
but this happens all the time.

2052
01:31:00,601 --> 01:31:01,840
But you have this.
What is that?

2053
01:31:01,890 --> 01:31:03,240
What do you think that is?
Um,

2054
01:31:03,290 --> 01:31:08,290
obviously it's ego,
but what is that where a fighter does 

2055
01:31:08,290 --> 01:31:11,691
not want to continue to grow and can't 
step outside themselves and look and 

2056
01:31:12,571 --> 01:31:12,900
say,
well,

2057
01:31:12,901 --> 01:31:17,901
this is a position that I may be in and 
this is some knowledge that I should 

2058
01:31:17,901 --> 01:31:21,411
acquire.
It's very difficult to look at what 

2059
01:31:21,411 --> 01:31:21,720
you're doing and go,
this isn't right.

2060
01:31:21,721 --> 01:31:25,020
I need to make these changes.
Or sometimes it's even harder to go.

2061
01:31:25,021 --> 01:31:27,000
Boy,
it took me a lot of work to get here.

2062
01:31:27,360 --> 01:31:29,340
I think it's Kinda natural.
My daughter is seven.

2063
01:31:29,700 --> 01:31:31,530
She's in second grade and she said 
gymnast.

2064
01:31:31,820 --> 01:31:34,890
So let this year she just started 
winning everything,

2065
01:31:35,190 --> 01:31:37,920
right?
She won every event in the all around in

2066
01:31:37,921 --> 01:31:42,921
two or three different meats and she got
a little cocky and stuff to work that 

2067
01:31:42,921 --> 01:31:44,050
hard in the gym.
Even her coach told me,

2068
01:31:44,051 --> 01:31:45,060
he said,
I got this,

2069
01:31:45,890 --> 01:31:49,080
and then she lost and was pissed.
I mean,

2070
01:31:49,110 --> 01:31:51,270
good old fashioned.
My wife tried to bring her back.

2071
01:31:51,271 --> 01:31:51,600
I'm like,
no,

2072
01:31:51,601 --> 01:31:53,310
no.
Let her be angry like this.

2073
01:31:53,311 --> 01:31:54,070
Right.
Was,

2074
01:31:54,080 --> 01:31:58,290
it wasn't like a cry baby pissed.
It was like I'm pissed.

2075
01:31:58,510 --> 01:31:59,560
Right.
So

2076
01:32:00,280 --> 01:32:02,830
I think sometimes when success comes to 
you,

2077
01:32:03,070 --> 01:32:08,070
you start to believe that you're 
invincible and you see this in business 

2078
01:32:08,070 --> 01:32:08,070
all the time.
You know,

2079
01:32:08,070 --> 01:32:10,280
people are successful in business and 
they'll start a new business in and fail

2080
01:32:10,281 --> 01:32:12,660
miserably happened to me when I first 
got started in business,

2081
01:32:12,670 --> 01:32:15,400
a successful chiropractic offices in 
Australia.

2082
01:32:15,460 --> 01:32:16,750
That happened right away.
I was young,

2083
01:32:16,751 --> 01:32:21,751
26 years old and all of a sudden I tried
something new and lost everything I 

2084
01:32:21,751 --> 01:32:23,080
couldn't lose.
I knew this,

2085
01:32:23,081 --> 01:32:24,060
I got this.
I made a,

2086
01:32:24,160 --> 01:32:25,270
you know,
I had done all these things.

2087
01:32:25,271 --> 01:32:27,350
Well,
and something happens in the brain.

2088
01:32:27,351 --> 01:32:32,351
It's very,
very difficult to keep resetting 

2089
01:32:32,351 --> 01:32:32,351
yourself going,
okay,

2090
01:32:32,351 --> 01:32:33,670
today's a new day.
Here's what worked from our last one,

2091
01:32:33,880 --> 01:32:35,950
here's what we're going to do next.
Because often what happens to,

2092
01:32:35,951 --> 01:32:40,951
if someone has a big loss,
they want to change everything about 

2093
01:32:40,951 --> 01:32:40,951
what they were doing.

2094
01:32:40,951 --> 01:32:41,500
Yeah,
I need to do to train part.

2095
01:32:41,501 --> 01:32:42,010
I knew,
coach,

2096
01:32:42,011 --> 01:32:44,020
you have to do this as well.
Let's think about it.

2097
01:32:44,021 --> 01:32:45,970
You had all this success up until this 
point.

2098
01:32:46,810 --> 01:32:51,810
Do we need to change everything or do we
need to make a small adjustment in this 

2099
01:32:51,810 --> 01:32:52,120
one area?
And often that's what it is,

2100
01:32:52,121 --> 01:32:53,890
but people forever,
the reason they can't,

2101
01:32:54,400 --> 01:32:57,010
they can't make the adjustment.
Pat's been really good with that.

2102
01:32:57,011 --> 01:32:58,630
You know,
he had a big loss for Daniel.

2103
01:32:58,631 --> 01:33:03,631
That was.
Those are hard for people to come back 

2104
01:33:03,631 --> 01:33:04,580
within that sentence,
know people don't realize everything you

2105
01:33:04,600 --> 01:33:06,100
train.
Not many people are going to do it.

2106
01:33:06,101 --> 01:33:11,101
Pat Did,
which suffer for three and a half or 

2107
01:33:11,101 --> 01:33:11,101
four years,
train every day,

2108
01:33:11,101 --> 01:33:12,670
go through this whole process,
not make any money.

2109
01:33:12,910 --> 01:33:14,170
You know,
every year,

2110
01:33:14,180 --> 01:33:15,310
birthday,
one year old,

2111
01:33:15,311 --> 01:33:17,440
he finally gets a shot and then he loses
like that.

2112
01:33:17,740 --> 01:33:19,900
It's very hard to come back and to his 
credit,

2113
01:33:19,901 --> 01:33:22,420
he did that and we looked at everything.
We said,

2114
01:33:22,421 --> 01:33:24,010
okay,
here's a couple of areas that we need to

2115
01:33:24,011 --> 01:33:29,011
change.
It wasn't throwaway the playbook and we 

2116
01:33:29,011 --> 01:33:29,011
start over again.
It was,

2117
01:33:29,011 --> 01:33:30,520
here's what we need to do,
and we do that for every camp.

2118
01:33:31,030 --> 01:33:33,520
Some people are willing to do it,
most people are not.

2119
01:33:34,030 --> 01:33:34,930
Which is why,
again,

2120
01:33:34,931 --> 01:33:37,930
we talk about is there going to be 
enough talent development in this area?

2121
01:33:38,560 --> 01:33:43,560
It's very hard to get someone prepared 
to be successful in the long time in a 

2122
01:33:43,560 --> 01:33:44,110
cage because most guys would get signed 
to the UFC,

2123
01:33:44,111 --> 01:33:45,820
are there for a couple of fights and 
that's it.

2124
01:33:46,730 --> 01:33:51,680
How did you decide to dedicate your time
and your life to this?

2125
01:33:51,681 --> 01:33:56,681
Because this is a very tricky position 
to be in because you're not the master 

2126
01:33:56,681 --> 01:34:01,451
of your own destiny.
You are the master of creating the 

2127
01:34:01,451 --> 01:34:05,441
opportunities for someone else to 
achieve their destiny and your destiny 

2128
01:34:05,441 --> 01:34:09,091
is essentially tied in to them,
tied into their work ethic,

2129
01:34:09,171 --> 01:34:11,180
their willpower.
They're focused.

2130
01:34:11,181 --> 01:34:12,880
They're all of the above,
their,

2131
01:34:12,881 --> 01:34:17,881
their athleticism,
their natural talents as well as their 

2132
01:34:17,881 --> 01:34:22,240
intuition and those intangible factors 
like the toughness that Dan has or you 

2133
01:34:22,761 --> 01:34:23,290
know,
the,

2134
01:34:23,291 --> 01:34:28,291
the,
the freak athleticism that some other 

2135
01:34:28,291 --> 01:34:28,550
fighters have.
There's so many factors and your life.

2136
01:34:28,551 --> 01:34:33,551
You're very fucking smart guy,
but your life is tied in with their 

2137
01:34:33,551 --> 01:34:36,650
success and I'll sound that smart now 
doing what you do because it's working,

2138
01:34:36,920 --> 01:34:38,810
but how did you.
I mean,

2139
01:34:38,811 --> 01:34:40,880
you had a million times,
right?

2140
01:34:40,910 --> 01:34:41,420
Yeah.
Oh yeah.

2141
01:34:41,430 --> 01:34:42,990
There's always tough.
I think it's

2142
01:34:43,320 --> 01:34:45,090
personality.
When I finished chiropractic school,

2143
01:34:45,091 --> 01:34:50,091
I got a great offer and Phoenix from an 
amazing doctor who was a mentor to me 

2144
01:34:50,091 --> 01:34:54,850
and instead I with no money in my pocket
but a one way ticket to Australia ship 

2145
01:34:55,051 --> 01:34:57,180
my hundred and 50 pound Neapolitan,
massive.

2146
01:34:57,320 --> 01:35:00,710
Not enough minding Americorps and teen 
30 days later and went and made it work,

2147
01:35:01,520 --> 01:35:06,520
so I guess it's my personality.
I knew I wanted to move to another 

2148
01:35:07,161 --> 01:35:12,161
country who's either Costa Rica or 
Australia and I chose this tray because 

2149
01:35:12,161 --> 01:35:16,121
there was an established chiropractic 
association there and I had met an 

2150
01:35:16,121 --> 01:35:18,200
Aussie girl which made them move a 
little bit easier and literally bought a

2151
01:35:18,201 --> 01:35:20,660
one way ticket,
landed there with no money,

2152
01:35:21,000 --> 01:35:26,000
but it taught me a valuable lesson 
because I had made this decision 18 

2153
01:35:26,000 --> 01:35:27,020
months prior for 18 months.
Every day.

2154
01:35:27,021 --> 01:35:32,021
I said the same mantra to myself.
I think that the intention is so 

2155
01:35:32,021 --> 01:35:34,160
important in your life on what you 
decided to focus on.

2156
01:35:34,160 --> 01:35:36,470
I mean really focused on with all of 
your energy.

2157
01:35:36,860 --> 01:35:41,860
I believe that if you're in that place 
with full trust that the universe will 

2158
01:35:41,860 --> 01:35:43,120
direct you in this,
in this direction.

2159
01:35:43,270 --> 01:35:44,080
Woo.
Crazy.

2160
01:35:44,150 --> 01:35:45,350
Sounds really crazy,
right?

2161
01:35:45,590 --> 01:35:48,500
So every day I said to myself,
for 18 months,

2162
01:35:48,680 --> 01:35:50,870
I'm going to move to Australia.
My live in the tropics.

2163
01:35:50,871 --> 01:35:51,910
I'm gonna.
Have my own practice.

2164
01:35:51,920 --> 01:35:56,920
It's going to be great.
I'm going to move to Australia and I 

2165
01:35:56,920 --> 01:35:59,111
live in the tropics.
I said this mantra over 20 times in 

2166
01:35:59,111 --> 01:36:00,260
Australia because of the check.
Now I just.

2167
01:36:00,261 --> 01:36:02,330
I looked at Australia,
I thought it was great.

2168
01:36:02,430 --> 01:36:07,430
It looked like a nice place.
I wanted to move to another country and 

2169
01:36:07,430 --> 01:36:09,731
here I go and I wanted to live in the 
tropics that had been to the Caribbean 

2170
01:36:09,731 --> 01:36:12,371
at 14 and night,
sitting on Saint Croix on January 2nd 

2171
01:36:12,371 --> 01:36:16,751
and it's 88 degrees and I'm 14 and I 
couldn't understand where there were 

2172
01:36:16,751 --> 01:36:18,480
places like this and I lived where I did
the two just didn't,

2173
01:36:18,970 --> 01:36:19,940
didn't add up to me.

2174
01:36:19,940 --> 01:36:21,590
So I decided I wanted to live in the 
tropics.

2175
01:36:21,591 --> 01:36:24,560
Australia seemed like a good place,
so I landed there,

2176
01:36:24,680 --> 01:36:27,920
hated it.
The relationship was done with the girl,

2177
01:36:28,010 --> 01:36:30,770
I don't have enough money.
My dog is ticking down.

2178
01:36:30,771 --> 01:36:33,410
I got to come up with $1,500
to get them out of quarantine.

2179
01:36:33,800 --> 01:36:34,820
Right.
I have no.

2180
01:36:34,821 --> 01:36:39,821
I've never had a job before.
My only other skill was throwing people 

2181
01:36:39,821 --> 01:36:41,000
out of a bar and now I had to go start a
business,

2182
01:36:41,001 --> 01:36:42,680
be it,
find some way to make this work.

2183
01:36:43,490 --> 01:36:48,490
Three and a half weeks later or three 
days before my dogs do together 

2184
01:36:48,490 --> 01:36:52,010
quarantine.
I owned three practices in the Sunday 

2185
01:36:52,010 --> 01:36:52,370
islands.
If you.

2186
01:36:52,400 --> 01:36:56,810
They look up the Sunday that I believe 
it's the power of intention,

2187
01:36:56,811 --> 01:36:58,760
but I heard something from somebody got 
in a car,

2188
01:36:58,761 --> 01:37:03,761
drove up 14 hours,
met a doctor who wanted to get out of 

2189
01:37:03,761 --> 01:37:03,761
there quick.

2190
01:37:03,761 --> 01:37:06,140
She sold me her practices for $5,000
that she agreed to let me pay $1,000

2191
01:37:06,141 --> 01:37:11,141
a month over five months.
I walked in there my first day and made 

2192
01:37:11,141 --> 01:37:11,420
like $800.
My first day,

2193
01:37:11,690 --> 01:37:13,940
I'm 26 years old.
Went and got my dog,

2194
01:37:13,941 --> 01:37:16,820
had a quarantine and that was the.
That was my start.

2195
01:37:17,040 --> 01:37:22,040
Why?
But I was willing to find out about her 

2196
01:37:22,040 --> 01:37:23,630
how this is pre google.
Well,

2197
01:37:23,631 --> 01:37:24,470
that's the PR.
That's.

2198
01:37:24,471 --> 01:37:29,471
Here's the other thing too.
What I would do is I would get 

2199
01:37:29,471 --> 01:37:30,050
chiropractic journals at the,
um,

2200
01:37:30,530 --> 01:37:35,530
at the library.
It was called Los Angeles College of 

2201
01:37:35,530 --> 01:37:38,840
Chiropractic.
And I would cold call chiropractors and 

2202
01:37:38,840 --> 01:37:38,840
just say,
what's it like down there?

2203
01:37:38,840 --> 01:37:39,020
Do you know?
I would just call people.

2204
01:37:39,080 --> 01:37:41,270
Right.
And that's how I ended up.

2205
01:37:41,271 --> 01:37:46,271
So I was there for five years and I 
would fly over to Japan to meet Dan and 

2206
01:37:46,271 --> 01:37:48,630
then came back and decided that I wanted
to make.

2207
01:37:48,710 --> 01:37:53,710
Now the [inaudible] m I made the.
There wasn't really a way to make a 

2208
01:37:53,710 --> 01:37:54,470
living doing this stuff.
Not much.

2209
01:37:54,560 --> 01:37:55,410
No,
but it was,

2210
01:37:55,460 --> 01:37:56,160
it's what I wanted

2211
01:37:56,160 --> 01:37:58,020
to do and I had some other great things 
happen,

2212
01:37:58,021 --> 01:38:01,200
but I think you asked me why I'm willing
to do it.

2213
01:38:01,201 --> 01:38:03,810
I think if I really trust my gut,
my intuition that,

2214
01:38:03,910 --> 01:38:08,910
that I'm going to be okay.
And through the process I met Kevin 

2215
01:38:08,910 --> 01:38:12,410
James and worked with him for a year and
got involved with some movie stuff and 

2216
01:38:12,410 --> 01:38:13,710
created a television show that we sold 
to Fox that ultimately didn't get picked

2217
01:38:13,711 --> 01:38:14,280
up.
But again,

2218
01:38:14,281 --> 01:38:15,700
all these other things started to 
happen.

2219
01:38:17,970 --> 01:38:22,830
That was the weirdest shit over my 
computer.

2220
01:38:22,831 --> 01:38:27,210
Just decided to start playing.
You just heard your voice mark computer.

2221
01:38:27,390 --> 01:38:28,770
Yeah,
that's bizarre.

2222
01:38:28,860 --> 01:38:33,860
It's never done that before.
I didn't have it on the page.

2223
01:38:34,081 --> 01:38:39,081
I don't know what the fuck happened.
I wasn't even touching my computer 

2224
01:38:39,081 --> 01:38:39,081
anyway.
Not Important.

2225
01:38:39,081 --> 01:38:40,030
Um,
so for me,

2226
01:38:40,080 --> 01:38:45,080
for me it's about really trusting that 
instinct that this is going to be the 

2227
01:38:45,080 --> 01:38:48,261
right thing to do,
even if there's not any evidence that 

2228
01:38:48,261 --> 01:38:48,261
this is going to work out.

2229
01:38:48,261 --> 01:38:51,450
But you were involved with team quest,
like even pre this,

2230
01:38:51,840 --> 01:38:52,330
right?
I,

2231
01:38:52,470 --> 01:38:55,560
I created the name team quest and this 
was back when?

2232
01:38:55,561 --> 01:39:00,561
Randy for Tony Palma in like 96.
I think Randy started in [inaudible] 97.

2233
01:39:02,580 --> 01:39:07,580
Yeah.
He fought and I didn't have anything to 

2234
01:39:07,580 --> 01:39:07,580
do.
How am I?

2235
01:39:07,580 --> 01:39:07,620
Was his first fight in the UFC obviously
choked him.

2236
01:39:07,920 --> 01:39:10,290
Yeah,
I think it was 2097.

2237
01:39:11,280 --> 01:39:14,040
Yeah,
well I had known Dan and those guys from

2238
01:39:14,041 --> 01:39:17,360
college and kind of came up with them 
and the full fighting started.

2239
01:39:17,670 --> 01:39:22,670
Everything kind of came from there and 
every step of the way I looked at what 

2240
01:39:22,670 --> 01:39:23,460
skills that I would need to develop to 
be successful.

2241
01:39:23,461 --> 01:39:28,461
So initially it was all soft tissue 
chiropractic stuff and then more and 

2242
01:39:28,461 --> 01:39:33,021
more into nutrition and then I realized,
oh I really liked the training side of 

2243
01:39:33,021 --> 01:39:36,561
things and I was only.
I've only been involved with very high 

2244
01:39:36,561 --> 01:39:36,810
level of camps but very high level 
athlete.

2245
01:39:36,810 --> 01:39:39,060
That's been my whole experience.
Lucky shit man.

2246
01:39:39,080 --> 01:39:42,630
97 may [inaudible] 1997.
Yeah.

2247
01:39:43,560 --> 01:39:48,030
So I was there for that.
I was there for that.

2248
01:39:48,031 --> 01:39:53,031
And Steve Grandfather afterwards,
Steve Graham was a guy who a lot of 

2249
01:39:53,031 --> 01:39:56,091
people had a lot a lot of hope for 
people thought that was going to be 

2250
01:39:56,091 --> 01:39:56,091
something special.
Right.

2251
01:39:56,091 --> 01:39:56,490
Big,
strong,

2252
01:39:56,491 --> 01:40:01,491
fast athletic shoe.
But Randy just fucking pick them up and 

2253
01:40:01,491 --> 01:40:03,210
smashed him,
dumped him on his back and just beat the

2254
01:40:03,211 --> 01:40:08,211
fuck out of them and then beat the shit 
out of Vituro and his third man fight 

2255
01:40:08,211 --> 01:40:12,620
the time where everybody thought that 
tour was the second coming of Jesus on 

2256
01:40:12,620 --> 01:40:16,611
the screen and said,
I think it no known weaknesses and what 

2257
01:40:16,611 --> 01:40:16,611
they put on this.
Yeah.

2258
01:40:17,010 --> 01:40:22,010
That was insane.
That was a 19 year old or 20 year old 

2259
01:40:22,010 --> 01:40:22,010
veto or whatever.
It was.

2260
01:40:22,010 --> 01:40:22,540
Probably 19.
Yeah.

2261
01:40:22,890 --> 01:40:27,890
And uh,
had gotten up to like 240 pounds by 

2262
01:40:27,890 --> 01:40:28,440
then.
You looked like a lion.

2263
01:40:28,530 --> 01:40:32,310
He didn't come out of his trailer.
He was in the cage waiting.

2264
01:40:33,540 --> 01:40:34,910
Also.
Remember that there was.

2265
01:40:35,490 --> 01:40:39,330
That was the infamous.
He had a worm excuse,

2266
01:40:39,810 --> 01:40:40,740
right?
What do I never heard?

2267
01:40:40,750 --> 01:40:43,170
This designer's randy just had kind of 
hanging out in the case.

2268
01:40:43,530 --> 01:40:47,110
There was some sort of parasitic issue 
that he was thinking.

2269
01:40:47,400 --> 01:40:50,430
He was also training with this guy who 
wind up dead.

2270
01:40:50,870 --> 01:40:53,950
This guy named Curtis who was a 
bodybuilder that,

2271
01:40:53,951 --> 01:40:54,220
uh,

2272
01:40:54,220 --> 01:40:54,970
we would,
uh,

2273
01:40:54,971 --> 01:40:59,971
Eddie Bravo who's a eddie was my friend 
even way back then from when we're at 

2274
01:40:59,971 --> 01:41:02,020
John jocks and it was like a blue belt 
or a purple belt.

2275
01:41:02,030 --> 01:41:04,630
I think he might have been even a blue 
belt back then,

2276
01:41:04,990 --> 01:41:05,560
but,
um,

2277
01:41:06,250 --> 01:41:09,640
we wound up working out the gym with 
this dude at the same time,

2278
01:41:09,670 --> 01:41:10,840
you know,
we weren't working out with him,

2279
01:41:10,841 --> 01:41:13,210
but vittores trainer was,
uh,

2280
01:41:13,470 --> 01:41:18,470
just about as purple as a guy who get 
and still be a white guy.

2281
01:41:18,700 --> 01:41:20,470
It was the weirdest shit ever.
I mean,

2282
01:41:20,471 --> 01:41:25,471
I don't know what the fuck he was on,
but I assume it was everything all 

2283
01:41:25,471 --> 01:41:30,021
together at once.
And we used to call them garden hoses 

2284
01:41:30,021 --> 01:41:30,610
because he had veins,
like fucking garden hoses on his body.

2285
01:41:30,611 --> 01:41:35,611
I mean,
they were just the most retarded veins 

2286
01:41:35,611 --> 01:41:35,611
you've ever seen in your life.
And he was enormous.

2287
01:41:35,611 --> 01:41:38,200
He was maybe five,
10 and probably weighed 350 pounds.

2288
01:41:39,250 --> 01:41:39,340
Okay.

2289
01:41:41,390 --> 01:41:42,750
Just purple.
He would work out.

2290
01:41:42,751 --> 01:41:45,570
He was to a strength trainer.
He was his buddy,

2291
01:41:46,170 --> 01:41:47,880
trainer,
bodybuilder,

2292
01:41:48,180 --> 01:41:50,970
supplier of Mexicans,
steroids or whatever the fuck it was,

2293
01:41:50,971 --> 01:41:55,971
whatever was going on.
But vituro had gotten up to two 40 and 

2294
01:41:55,971 --> 01:41:56,580
this is over the course of,
you know,

2295
01:41:56,581 --> 01:41:59,130
fucking year gained about 40 pounds of 
muscle.

2296
01:41:59,370 --> 01:42:02,850
And it was when everybody was worried 
about Mark Coleman.

2297
01:42:03,180 --> 01:42:08,180
Everybody was worried about the fucking 
hammer because they'd seen coleman in 

2298
01:42:08,180 --> 01:42:12,711
his prime stud wrestler who had hit that
fucking power double on you,

2299
01:42:13,650 --> 01:42:17,460
compress you into the cage and just beat
the piss out of people.

2300
01:42:17,610 --> 01:42:20,970
And everybody was thinking,
how do I keep this fucking guy off me?

2301
01:42:21,300 --> 01:42:25,020
And their solution was get as big as 
colman and Colman was,

2302
01:42:25,021 --> 01:42:29,430
you know,
two 55 just just jacked the tests,

2303
01:42:29,870 --> 01:42:32,700
you know.
And when he fought maurice,

2304
01:42:32,701 --> 01:42:34,530
nobody gave him,
gave him a shot.

2305
01:42:34,890 --> 01:42:36,240
Everybody was like,
you know,

2306
01:42:36,270 --> 01:42:38,550
Maurice got no shot.
He's going to get smashed.

2307
01:42:38,850 --> 01:42:43,850
And I remember talking to Maurice before
the fight and before the fight I was 

2308
01:42:43,850 --> 01:42:45,900
supposed to do this thing for a NBC 
where I was,

2309
01:42:46,300 --> 01:42:48,750
you know,
Bob Costas used to have that show later.

2310
01:42:48,840 --> 01:42:51,030
Remember that show later.
And uh,

2311
01:42:51,060 --> 01:42:54,030
he had left and they were looking for 
new hosts,

2312
01:42:54,270 --> 01:42:59,270
so they would do,
is have a different person who hosts it 

2313
01:42:59,270 --> 01:43:01,221
for a week.
This is when I was on news radio and I 

2314
01:43:01,221 --> 01:43:03,360
was hosting it for a week.
And so I was talking to Maurice and uh,

2315
01:43:03,530 --> 01:43:05,220
you know,
he would always call me Joseph Joseph,

2316
01:43:05,400 --> 01:43:06,750
you know,
we're going to do that TV thing.

2317
01:43:06,751 --> 01:43:07,770
Let's do that TV thing.
I was like,

2318
01:43:07,771 --> 01:43:08,220
yeah,
yeah,

2319
01:43:08,221 --> 01:43:13,221
we'll do it.
I'm thinking this poor fucking guy is 

2320
01:43:13,221 --> 01:43:13,221
going to go fight Mark Mark Coleman.
And he's like,

2321
01:43:13,221 --> 01:43:14,910
so calm and oblivious like he doesn't 
even.

2322
01:43:15,000 --> 01:43:17,550
Does he realize who he's fighting?
Does he know?

2323
01:43:17,551 --> 01:43:18,570
He's?
Of course he knew,

2324
01:43:18,750 --> 01:43:20,400
you know,
I was the one that was ridiculous.

2325
01:43:20,550 --> 01:43:24,190
Maurice was so calm and relaxed because 
he had insane cardio me.

2326
01:43:24,220 --> 01:43:28,080
Maurice would say slim swim lap after 
lap.

2327
01:43:28,081 --> 01:43:32,520
I mean he was just dedicated to cardio.
That was a good big part of his training

2328
01:43:32,521 --> 01:43:37,521
regiment.
So his idea was just ride the storm in 

2329
01:43:37,521 --> 01:43:38,160
the beginning and then start getting 
that big fucker tired out.

2330
01:43:38,380 --> 01:43:41,760
Like he was the first guy to realize you
can't really be that big man.

2331
01:43:42,060 --> 01:43:44,850
You can't sustain that.
Matt Hume with him too,

2332
01:43:44,851 --> 01:43:45,950
right?
Yup.

2333
01:43:46,170 --> 01:43:47,240
Yup.
He hadn't Matt Hume,

2334
01:43:47,250 --> 01:43:52,250
any had world class kickboxing skills.
Maurice was the first guy to fight in 

2335
01:43:53,301 --> 01:43:58,301
the UFC first.
Got To fight and Emma had ligit world 

2336
01:43:58,301 --> 01:44:02,021
championship kickboxing skills.
And remember when he fought cone and 

2337
01:44:02,021 --> 01:44:03,320
Sylvia,
that was the first head kick.

2338
01:44:03,320 --> 01:44:05,240
Keto we ever saw.
A high level of fight,

2339
01:44:05,480 --> 01:44:08,670
especially against a Brazilian jujitsu 
black belt like Brazilian Jiu Jitsu.

2340
01:44:08,730 --> 01:44:11,420
Blackbelt was like having an iron man 
suit back then.

2341
01:44:11,450 --> 01:44:13,400
Like,
this guy's got a Brazilian Jujitsu,

2342
01:44:13,480 --> 01:44:18,480
black belt baby can't be beaten.
Maurice fucking bounced this Shin Off 

2343
01:44:18,711 --> 01:44:23,711
Kona Anz head and that was like a new 
era and then fought coleman in the next 

2344
01:44:24,201 --> 01:44:29,201
fight and uh,
just fucking dominated coleman down the 

2345
01:44:29,201 --> 01:44:30,710
stretch and won the title.
And like one of the biggest upsets ever.

2346
01:44:31,490 --> 01:44:34,860
But detour was in the Mark Coleman 
school detour.

2347
01:44:34,890 --> 01:44:36,710
I mean,
you think about veto or now looks like a

2348
01:44:36,711 --> 01:44:37,850
welterweight.
I mean,

2349
01:44:37,851 --> 01:44:39,530
now that he's off testosterone 
replacement,

2350
01:44:39,531 --> 01:44:44,531
literally looks like he's a one 70 
pounder in between camps and back then 

2351
01:44:44,780 --> 01:44:48,170
was just fucking huge.
20 years old,

2352
01:44:48,760 --> 01:44:50,720
20 years old,
gigantic.

2353
01:44:51,080 --> 01:44:55,400
And Randy came in and smashed them.
Just smashed them,

2354
01:44:55,401 --> 01:44:58,670
just ground him out and just beat him 
down.

2355
01:44:58,910 --> 01:45:01,450
And I remember the end of the fight him 
on top of Vituro,

2356
01:45:01,730 --> 01:45:05,230
relentlessly pounding on him.
Boom,

2357
01:45:05,231 --> 01:45:10,231
boom.
And people couldn't believe it was like 

2358
01:45:10,231 --> 01:45:10,231
Mike Tyson getting beat by buster 
Douglas.

2359
01:45:10,231 --> 01:45:10,750
This is gabby.
I can't,

2360
01:45:10,760 --> 01:45:13,640
can't be really be seeing this is can't 
really be happening.

2361
01:45:14,290 --> 01:45:19,040
Change via towards life for years after 
that to Vitara long time to recover from

2362
01:45:19,041 --> 01:45:20,150
that fight.
I bet.

2363
01:45:20,440 --> 01:45:25,440
Eh,
he was never the same guy for a long 

2364
01:45:25,440 --> 01:45:25,440
time.
Now he is,

2365
01:45:25,440 --> 01:45:25,440
you know,
now he's a motherfucker now.

2366
01:45:25,440 --> 01:45:27,590
He's probably the best ever that he's 
ever been.

2367
01:45:28,160 --> 01:45:32,510
But still that randy fight,
that changes a lot of shit.

2368
01:45:34,240 --> 01:45:35,450
So you were involved back then?

2369
01:45:37,040 --> 01:45:39,770
I've been friends with this guy since 
1992.

2370
01:45:39,830 --> 01:45:41,750
Were you up in Oregon with them?
No,

2371
01:45:41,751 --> 01:45:43,340
I would go up.
I will kind of do adults.

2372
01:45:43,350 --> 01:45:46,220
Jay does now.
I'll go up with randy before a couple of

2373
01:45:46,220 --> 01:45:50,510
weeks before his diet nutrition.
Get ready.

2374
01:45:50,511 --> 01:45:51,920
And you were doing it just because you 
were friends?

2375
01:45:52,070 --> 01:45:53,810
Yeah.
And you were still a chiropractor at the

2376
01:45:53,811 --> 01:45:56,540
time?
This is a transitional time,

2377
01:45:56,570 --> 01:45:58,640
so I had moved back to the US from 
Australia.

2378
01:45:58,641 --> 01:46:01,470
Is here for five years.
Um,

2379
01:46:01,880 --> 01:46:03,710
what years were you in the?
In Australia?

2380
01:46:04,020 --> 01:46:08,200
My [inaudible] to [inaudible] maybe 
[inaudible].

2381
01:46:08,900 --> 01:46:09,740
[inaudible].
I mean,

2382
01:46:09,800 --> 01:46:13,040
I'm sorry.
98 to 2002 or [inaudible],

2383
01:46:13,041 --> 01:46:16,250
something like that.
So you knew them before you knew them?

2384
01:46:16,251 --> 01:46:18,470
When Randy first came to the UFC for 
like years,

2385
01:46:18,471 --> 01:46:22,520
so I knew them years before we had ever 
heard of fighting or randy first saw the

2386
01:46:22,521 --> 01:46:23,690
UFC went.
That's crazy.

2387
01:46:23,691 --> 01:46:24,260
Who would ever do

2388
01:46:24,460 --> 01:46:24,750
that?

2389
01:46:26,220 --> 01:46:30,210
This is like 90.
I think I first met Randy in 1992.

2390
01:46:30,211 --> 01:46:32,890
Him and Dan's still had mullets.
That's awesome.

2391
01:46:33,120 --> 01:46:34,510
Yeah.
So this is the.

2392
01:46:34,550 --> 01:46:36,330
So they fought years,
years later.

2393
01:46:36,810 --> 01:46:39,560
These are the guys I started do 
everything I do now is cut,

2394
01:46:39,570 --> 01:46:44,130
developed from the training sense of 
these guys got me started with that from

2395
01:46:44,131 --> 01:46:47,130
the management sense.
It was some your managers through Kevin.

2396
01:46:47,131 --> 01:46:52,131
I became close with Chandra and jeff and
they kind of were graded at least 

2397
01:46:52,681 --> 01:46:54,690
letting me see how it really,
well,

2398
01:46:54,780 --> 01:46:57,780
like a top notch entertainment manager,
how do they operate,

2399
01:46:58,200 --> 01:47:03,200
how they handled things.
So are these two really interesting 

2400
01:47:03,200 --> 01:47:03,900
people to draw from to create this 
career that I have now.

2401
01:47:03,901 --> 01:47:05,760
And then I have my healthcare background
on top of it,

2402
01:47:05,761 --> 01:47:07,850
which you know,
management is,

2403
01:47:07,851 --> 01:47:09,750
is client service,
customer service,

2404
01:47:09,751 --> 01:47:12,360
really service the person that you're 
working with,

2405
01:47:12,361 --> 01:47:17,361
which is very similar to chiropractic.
So the mindset for me was very similar 

2406
01:47:17,361 --> 01:47:21,800
and on top of it all I found out that I 
had a real knack for marketing business 

2407
01:47:21,800 --> 01:47:23,610
and negotiating and it took a long time 
to develop.

2408
01:47:23,611 --> 01:47:24,750
But I ended up here.

2409
01:47:25,390 --> 01:47:30,390
Well Sandra and jeffers similar to your 
approach to training and managing,

2410
01:47:31,130 --> 01:47:36,130
you know,
developing athletes and like I've been 

2411
01:47:36,130 --> 01:47:36,130
with Jeff since I was an open micro.
Yeah.

2412
01:47:36,370 --> 01:47:41,370
Jeff and I have been together for I want
to sell at 23 years,

2413
01:47:42,200 --> 01:47:44,920
but he got me fresh.
I was just like,

2414
01:47:44,921 --> 01:47:47,270
I just had some potential,
you know,

2415
01:47:47,271 --> 01:47:50,260
and along the way as advised me,
you know,

2416
01:47:50,261 --> 01:47:50,890
and we,
you know,

2417
01:47:50,950 --> 01:47:55,950
we've made some bad turns and tried to 
figure things out and made some calls,

2418
01:47:56,540 --> 01:47:57,330
you know,
you know,

2419
01:47:57,331 --> 01:48:02,331
one is,
especially when it's something as open 

2420
01:48:02,331 --> 01:48:02,980
ended as a stand up comedy career,
like who the fuck knows

2421
01:48:03,640 --> 01:48:06,160
a very similar to [inaudible] in that 
sense.

2422
01:48:06,850 --> 01:48:08,170
Yeah.
Well you never know where it's gonna go.

2423
01:48:08,230 --> 01:48:13,230
Yeah.
But there's more options for stand up 

2424
01:48:13,230 --> 01:48:14,590
for a fight with.
It's also victory.

2425
01:48:14,620 --> 01:48:15,910
Yeah.
This is it.

2426
01:48:15,970 --> 01:48:17,800
Like you,
you got to figure out how to win,

2427
01:48:18,070 --> 01:48:23,070
you know,
with a standup comic because you've got 

2428
01:48:23,070 --> 01:48:23,070
to figure out how to be funny,
but you have to.

2429
01:48:23,070 --> 01:48:24,010
I mean this is a lot of different ways 
to be funny.

2430
01:48:24,160 --> 01:48:29,160
You know,
there's just a lot of different ways to 

2431
01:48:29,160 --> 01:48:29,160
win.
Yeah.

2432
01:48:29,160 --> 01:48:29,160
But you,
it's like,

2433
01:48:29,160 --> 01:48:33,580
here's a perfect example.
There's some guys who just will not be 

2434
01:48:33,580 --> 01:48:33,580
funny if they're following the wrong 
guy.

2435
01:48:33,730 --> 01:48:36,910
Like if you follow a super wild high 
energy guy,

2436
01:48:36,911 --> 01:48:40,240
let's say like Sam Kinison,
like perfect example,

2437
01:48:40,241 --> 01:48:42,700
like Mitch Hedberg is one of my all time
favorite Comedians,

2438
01:48:43,000 --> 01:48:48,000
but Mitch Hedberg is very slow paced and
had a very like a silly style.

2439
01:48:48,550 --> 01:48:50,560
He had to like silly,
very silly style.

2440
01:48:50,830 --> 01:48:55,830
You know,
I eat a piece of carefree gum half an 

2441
01:48:55,830 --> 01:48:56,890
hour later.
I was still worried it never kicked in.

2442
01:48:57,210 --> 01:49:01,450
You know,
it's like something silly and funny.

2443
01:49:01,660 --> 01:49:06,660
But if he followed a guy like Kennedy 
and it was fucking play playback,

2444
01:49:08,170 --> 01:49:11,030
you would probably not buy into it.
You'd be like,

2445
01:49:11,650 --> 01:49:12,700
yeah,
this is too different.

2446
01:49:12,730 --> 01:49:15,220
It's too slow paced.
It's like a band.

2447
01:49:15,370 --> 01:49:20,370
Say like if guns and roses went on and 
then right after guns and roses,

2448
01:49:20,620 --> 01:49:25,500
some like ballad guy went on in the same
crowds to follow James Brown.

2449
01:49:26,250 --> 01:49:31,250
Perfect example.
No one wanted to follow a little 

2450
01:49:31,250 --> 01:49:31,250
Richard.
No one wanted to follow.

2451
01:49:31,250 --> 01:49:32,610
I mean,
there's a lot of guys like that.

2452
01:49:32,640 --> 01:49:35,980
You know,
Jerry Lee Lewis famously lit the fucking

2453
01:49:36,040 --> 01:49:41,040
piano on fire after he played because he
didn't want to Chuck Barry to go on 

2454
01:49:41,040 --> 01:49:44,120
after him and he said to Chuck Berry 
followed that motherfucker like,

2455
01:49:44,530 --> 01:49:47,980
that's like a famous story.
He might have said do

2456
01:49:47,980 --> 01:49:49,270
the,
depending on who you ask,

2457
01:49:49,570 --> 01:49:51,970
but bottom line is,
you know,

2458
01:49:52,180 --> 01:49:57,180
there's certain guys that like,
there was a certain impact that they 

2459
01:49:57,180 --> 01:49:59,140
would have on that fucking stage.
Guys like Chuck Berry,

2460
01:49:59,680 --> 01:50:01,720
Little Richard Guys like,
you know,

2461
01:50:02,290 --> 01:50:07,290
down the line,
there's been a lot of like James Brown 

2462
01:50:07,290 --> 01:50:09,871
is probably the best example.
Just what the fuck and follow James 

2463
01:50:09,871 --> 01:50:09,871
Brown,
James Brown.

2464
01:50:10,010 --> 01:50:11,080
I mean,
you know,

2465
01:50:11,100 --> 01:50:12,460
you can't,
you just can't.

2466
01:50:12,500 --> 01:50:16,960
It's like fucking shows over the career 
trajectory.

2467
01:50:16,961 --> 01:50:19,390
There's,
there's no roadmap to this is it?

2468
01:50:19,480 --> 01:50:20,410
It's a fighter.
It's,

2469
01:50:20,411 --> 01:50:22,230
you know,
you have as a community,

2470
01:50:22,250 --> 01:50:24,190
you and your manager,
you make these decisions.

2471
01:50:24,220 --> 01:50:26,170
For me,
it's not even about getting.

2472
01:50:26,320 --> 01:50:28,600
Some aren't gonna work out,
but what you do after that,

2473
01:50:28,630 --> 01:50:33,630
right?
It's similar in the fact that you're 

2474
01:50:33,630 --> 01:50:36,481
trying to develop this overall thing and
optimize who you are in how you express 

2475
01:50:37,541 --> 01:50:41,320
it through this thing that you're doing,
this thing that you're doing in Emma,

2476
01:50:41,360 --> 01:50:44,530
it's obviously it's a competition,
so it's very different,

2477
01:50:44,590 --> 01:50:46,570
but in the sense that you have to 
develop.

2478
01:50:46,570 --> 01:50:51,570
Conor Mcgregor's done a great job of 
letting us know who he is very easy to 

2479
01:50:51,570 --> 01:50:52,990
pick up on that and either like it or 
dislike,

2480
01:50:53,000 --> 01:50:54,970
you know exactly who it is and it's kind
of fun.

2481
01:50:55,720 --> 01:50:59,470
Have to help someone develop a style and
a persona and kind of.

2482
01:50:59,471 --> 01:51:01,580
I hate to use the word brand when 
talking about some of the.

2483
01:51:01,840 --> 01:51:04,370
Something that's unique about them that 
they put out there.

2484
01:51:04,450 --> 01:51:06,130
In that sense it's similar as a 
comedian,

2485
01:51:06,131 --> 01:51:09,610
are you Sam kinison type or you write,
you know,

2486
01:51:09,611 --> 01:51:11,710
how do you figure out who to be you 
best?

2487
01:51:11,740 --> 01:51:16,740
Yeah,
and a good manager is going to help you 

2488
01:51:16,740 --> 01:51:16,740
in that process along the way and that's
it.

2489
01:51:16,740 --> 01:51:20,850
It's a unique relationship.
You'll never have a relationship like 

2490
01:51:20,850 --> 01:51:21,460
the one you have with your manager.
It's totally unique.

2491
01:51:22,120 --> 01:51:23,500
Yeah,
it's a very.

2492
01:51:23,501 --> 01:51:28,501
It's a very unique relationship if you 
have a manager like you that is like 

2493
01:51:28,870 --> 01:51:32,500
really dedicated to developing an 
athlete from,

2494
01:51:32,560 --> 01:51:34,780
from the beginning,
from the start of their career.

2495
01:51:35,020 --> 01:51:40,020
It's like seeing what it is that takes 
them to reach their optimum level of 

2496
01:51:40,020 --> 01:51:43,240
performance and that changes to how you 
manage someone in the beginning.

2497
01:51:43,440 --> 01:51:45,930
I have to manage pet differently now.
Like uh,

2498
01:51:45,940 --> 01:51:50,940
how I work with Caitlin and a year from 
now I'll have to be different when she 

2499
01:51:50,940 --> 01:51:50,940
wins the belt.
It'll,

2500
01:51:50,940 --> 01:51:53,230
you have to constantly be changing.
Kyland.

2501
01:51:53,400 --> 01:51:56,050
Wait,
you're going to find out a one 15.

2502
01:51:56,290 --> 01:51:59,050
There's a bunch of a potential weight 
classes for women,

2503
01:51:59,051 --> 01:52:04,051
right?
I mean like right now we only got like 

2504
01:52:04,051 --> 01:52:05,640
one 15.
Do you see the Gabby Garcia is fighting 

2505
01:52:05,640 --> 01:52:08,470
in Paris is 135 pound woman.
Welcome to Japan,

2506
01:52:08,890 --> 01:52:10,660
Japan.
So she made vandelay look tiny.

2507
01:52:10,830 --> 01:52:11,920
Yeah.
Gabby Garcia,

2508
01:52:11,921 --> 01:52:16,921
if you don't know,
is a women's World Jujitsu champion who 

2509
01:52:16,921 --> 01:52:18,520
is fucking Jack.
I mean,

2510
01:52:18,550 --> 01:52:23,550
Jack like Tyron Woodley jacked and she's
a woman so it's all natural hundred 

2511
01:52:24,550 --> 01:52:28,990
percent and she's got to lose weight to 
get down to two 20.

2512
01:52:30,270 --> 01:52:31,660
She's getting hurt.
That's her contract.

2513
01:52:31,661 --> 01:52:33,030
Wait,
I guess apparently it was like her.

2514
01:52:33,070 --> 01:52:36,730
She has to be 20 and she's finding a 
woman was 135 pounds.

2515
01:52:37,240 --> 01:52:37,930
So like,
look at it,

2516
01:52:37,931 --> 01:52:41,200
look at it there with vandelay by the 
way.

2517
01:52:41,201 --> 01:52:46,040
That's vandelay in between fights.
Vandelay fought [inaudible] 85.

2518
01:52:46,060 --> 01:52:48,130
He never weighed [inaudible].
Chelsea.

2519
01:52:48,150 --> 01:52:49,790
All it did was lift weights for that 
Tuesday.

2520
01:52:49,791 --> 01:52:54,791
He's pumped up right there.
He's been in the waiting room and look 

2521
01:52:54,791 --> 01:52:55,450
at her.
So he was probably two.

2522
01:52:55,480 --> 01:52:58,060
Oh five to 10 back then,
you know,

2523
01:52:58,100 --> 01:53:02,000
in between fights and she's just 
enormous.

2524
01:53:02,240 --> 01:53:07,240
Look at her neck and face.
Totally looks like a woman to doesn't 

2525
01:53:07,240 --> 01:53:10,610
only.
He says any extra testosterone in their 

2526
01:53:10,610 --> 01:53:11,660
body at all.
Kidding.

2527
01:53:13,240 --> 01:53:15,140
Wow.
It's a fucking house.

2528
01:53:15,290 --> 01:53:16,820
That's not good for your clitoris.
Right?

2529
01:53:16,821 --> 01:53:21,821
It does not do strange things.
I've never seen a clitoris on 

2530
01:53:21,821 --> 01:53:21,821
testosterone,
but I can't imagine that's good,

2531
01:53:21,821 --> 01:53:24,920
but do not have a computer.
Do not connected to the Internet.

2532
01:53:24,921 --> 01:53:26,300
I have never.
Like today,

2533
01:53:26,301 --> 01:53:27,410
this afternoon,
and I'll look it up.

2534
01:53:27,411 --> 01:53:29,090
I'll tell you.
I can show you right now.

2535
01:53:29,750 --> 01:53:32,690
You want to see it?
That's up your shell or however you want

2536
01:53:32,691 --> 01:53:33,200
to take this.

2537
01:53:33,300 --> 01:53:36,110
Much of the rest of the blue get kicked 
off at ustream.

2538
01:53:36,620 --> 01:53:38,240
But yeah,
it grows like a penis.

2539
01:53:38,850 --> 01:53:41,030
Yeah.
Which makes you think like if a dude has

2540
01:53:41,031 --> 01:53:46,031
a little deck,
if he just takes a shit load of test 

2541
01:53:46,031 --> 01:53:46,031
every day.
It's like a few years was Dick Rowe.

2542
01:53:46,580 --> 01:53:51,580
I'm sure there's.
People have got to know the answer to 

2543
01:53:51,580 --> 01:53:51,580
that.
Someone's got to know the answer.

2544
01:53:51,580 --> 01:53:55,090
Yeah.
I would imagine grow a little new for 

2545
01:53:55,090 --> 01:53:56,360
people we could call an ask for at 
least.

2546
01:53:56,390 --> 01:53:59,690
How dare you be so conservative.
This,

2547
01:53:59,691 --> 01:54:04,691
um,
this is an interesting subject to 

2548
01:54:04,691 --> 01:54:04,691
because of,
um,

2549
01:54:04,691 --> 01:54:08,470
what's going on now with the eliminated 
completely eliminated testosterone 

2550
01:54:08,470 --> 01:54:11,060
replacement therapy and you know,
Vittorias the whipping boy when it comes

2551
01:54:11,061 --> 01:54:14,090
to that because cause he had the most 
spectacular results.

2552
01:54:14,670 --> 01:54:19,670
You look at how vituro looked when he 
fought rich Franklin whom one first 

2553
01:54:19,670 --> 01:54:23,671
round Kol.
But you look at his body and then you 

2554
01:54:23,671 --> 01:54:23,671
look at rich Franklin when he fought 
rockhold,

2555
01:54:23,671 --> 01:54:28,120
if our best bang when he fought Dan,
you're looking at this jacked fucking 

2556
01:54:28,120 --> 01:54:32,501
monster with muscles on his teeth and 
just ultra super confident it looks like

2557
01:54:32,701 --> 01:54:36,470
he can't be beat and so many people 
attribute that to,

2558
01:54:37,330 --> 01:54:38,960
to taking testosterone.

2559
01:54:39,020 --> 01:54:41,120
And it's,
it's unfortunate.

2560
01:54:41,330 --> 01:54:46,330
But it's fascinating.
It's unfortunate because like men veto 

2561
01:54:46,330 --> 01:54:47,330
accomplish so much.
I mean I think those,

2562
01:54:47,750 --> 01:54:52,130
those three fights where some of the 
most impressive chaos I've ever seen him

2563
01:54:52,131 --> 01:54:54,020
to stop and Dan and the first round like
that,

2564
01:54:54,140 --> 01:54:59,140
who fucks ever done that?
Who the fuck is ever dominated Dan like 

2565
01:54:59,140 --> 01:54:59,140
that?
Yeah.

2566
01:54:59,140 --> 01:55:03,040
I mean it was crazy.
Him and Dan was on testosterone at the 

2567
01:55:03,040 --> 01:55:05,831
same time too.
You know him stopping rockhold like 

2568
01:55:05,831 --> 01:55:05,831
that.
Him Head kicking bis bank.

2569
01:55:05,831 --> 01:55:10,590
Many people have mentioned that Dan and 
I actually did his therapeutic use 

2570
01:55:11,331 --> 01:55:14,780
exemption,
so I got the ball rolling with that.

2571
01:55:15,200 --> 01:55:20,200
And when we tested it,
and I'm sure he wouldn't mind me saying 

2572
01:55:20,200 --> 01:55:22,451
this,
he was off the charts in the wrong 

2573
01:55:22,451 --> 01:55:22,451
direction.
You wanted to close the numbers?

2574
01:55:22,451 --> 01:55:25,080
I think the scale is two 50,
two 11 [inaudible] eight.

2575
01:55:25,670 --> 01:55:30,670
Yeah.
Well that is higher than allister is 

2576
01:55:30,670 --> 01:55:30,700
right now and the higher than Vittorias 
right now I'm sure.

2577
01:55:30,701 --> 01:55:33,740
But Dan also never.
I've I know Dan's father.

2578
01:55:33,741 --> 01:55:36,650
Dan's dad had like a 550 pound bench 
press.

2579
01:55:36,950 --> 01:55:39,830
His,
his little sister is a sophomore in high

2580
01:55:39,831 --> 01:55:41,840
school.
Could hit a golf ball 300 yards.

2581
01:55:42,120 --> 01:55:44,100
You look at Gross,
like when I used

2582
01:55:44,100 --> 01:55:46,020
to do soft tissue work I did on Dan and 
Randy.

2583
01:55:46,021 --> 01:55:49,860
Dan was five times the effort.
He is so dense.

2584
01:55:49,950 --> 01:55:50,750
Yeah.
He's a weird guy.

2585
01:55:50,820 --> 01:55:55,820
You put your arm on his back,
you like while you're pictures with 

2586
01:55:55,820 --> 01:55:58,990
them.
It's like taking a picture with the 

2587
01:55:58,990 --> 01:55:58,990
tree.
Your tree.

2588
01:55:58,990 --> 01:56:00,930
You're not like the rest of us for sure.
So when I did that,

2589
01:56:00,931 --> 01:56:05,931
I also was so paranoid because I can't 
be the guy to fuck up Dan Henderson's 

2590
01:56:05,931 --> 01:56:07,980
career with a failed steroid tests 
called the UFC.

2591
01:56:07,981 --> 01:56:12,540
I called the Invest Athletic Commission.
I dragged him down there twice a week to

2592
01:56:12,541 --> 01:56:14,010
get blood tests.
He didn't want to do.

2593
01:56:14,011 --> 01:56:14,720
I'm like,
Nah,

2594
01:56:15,000 --> 01:56:18,270
if my name was on this one.
Now is this testing.

2595
01:56:18,271 --> 01:56:21,240
Sorry to interrupt you,
but this testing we tested 200.

2596
01:56:21,270 --> 01:56:26,270
That was his level.
Is this in camp or is it out of camp is 

2597
01:56:26,270 --> 01:56:26,270
just out of camp.
Yeah.

2598
01:56:26,270 --> 01:56:28,510
So it's not like hard training where 
everything gets Jack.

2599
01:56:28,520 --> 01:56:31,350
No.
What made you want to test him?

2600
01:56:33,540 --> 01:56:34,350
I just said,
you know,

2601
01:56:34,890 --> 01:56:37,380
you're not like it used to be and that's
what he said.

2602
01:56:37,680 --> 01:56:39,950
Dennis being overtrained.
Well what did you look for it?

2603
01:56:40,540 --> 01:56:42,900
I don't know,
but you're just not quite right.

2604
01:56:42,910 --> 01:56:47,910
And 34 maybe.
Well that's 35.

2605
01:56:49,110 --> 01:56:51,090
There could be a natural slowing down,
but he was very,

2606
01:56:51,091 --> 01:56:55,410
very low and the one thing he was very 
adamant because Dan never done any drugs

2607
01:56:55,411 --> 01:56:57,060
in his life.
He'll drink some bad light beer,

2608
01:56:57,061 --> 01:56:59,160
but that's about the extent of it.
Peer.

2609
01:56:59,280 --> 01:57:04,280
Yeah.
So he never abused anything when he was 

2610
01:57:04,280 --> 01:57:06,180
on.
We tested him regularly so I knew you.

2611
01:57:06,181 --> 01:57:07,620
You checked a little bit,
comes up,

2612
01:57:07,621 --> 01:57:10,980
come back down again.
He was never out of a range that was off

2613
01:57:10,981 --> 01:57:12,680
that scale.
So if there,

2614
01:57:12,681 --> 01:57:17,681
if the,
if the arrangement from two 50 to 1100 

2615
01:57:17,681 --> 01:57:20,001
he was,
we would go to a thousand in a couple 

2616
01:57:20,001 --> 01:57:20,001
days later it drops down again.

2617
01:57:20,001 --> 01:57:21,060
So he,
he never abused it in that sense.

2618
01:57:21,340 --> 01:57:23,550
And there's a lot of other guys he would
speculate,

2619
01:57:23,880 --> 01:57:25,830
did it very,
very opposite thing.

2620
01:57:25,831 --> 01:57:30,831
They took a whole bunch of stuff.
Dan took a prescribed medication that 

2621
01:57:30,831 --> 01:57:34,620
was really needed and never went,
but above levels that were not even high

2622
01:57:34,621 --> 01:57:36,450
levels for normal.
Just really,

2623
01:57:36,720 --> 01:57:39,900
let's just bring you up with just a 
little bit so you can recover.

2624
01:57:40,260 --> 01:57:45,260
Yeah.
And I think that to lump him in with 

2625
01:57:45,260 --> 01:57:46,200
someone who may be throughout their 
career,

2626
01:57:46,201 --> 01:57:51,201
abuse it in much different ways.
It's unfair and it's unfortunate that 

2627
01:57:51,201 --> 01:57:51,240
guys like Dan or thrown into that 
category.

2628
01:57:51,640 --> 01:57:53,940
Um,
but even if you look at dance weight has

2629
01:57:53,941 --> 01:57:58,400
not changed by more than four pounds.
His physique didn't change either.

2630
01:57:58,680 --> 01:58:00,270
Is He in his weight?
Didn't change.

2631
01:58:00,271 --> 01:58:00,730
He was.
Oh,

2632
01:58:00,750 --> 01:58:05,750
I remember when he was 20.
I think the heaviest I ever got was 205 

2633
01:58:05,750 --> 01:58:05,750
pounds.

2634
01:58:05,750 --> 01:58:08,490
And he was like 19 or 20,
working out like crazy and I don't think

2635
01:58:08,491 --> 01:58:10,980
he ever weighed in at 205 pounds on a 
scale.

2636
01:58:10,981 --> 01:58:12,210
And Emma?
No,

2637
01:58:12,240 --> 01:58:17,130
he was always like two or three in lower
[inaudible] and 40 [inaudible].

2638
01:58:17,190 --> 01:58:17,850
Yeah.
So Dan,

2639
01:58:17,851 --> 01:58:20,760
Dan never abused Denton.
A medication that was necessarily.

2640
01:58:20,761 --> 01:58:25,761
Dan did not abuse steroids in any sense.
But what is the argument obviously is 

2641
01:58:25,830 --> 01:58:30,510
should that medication be allowed?
I mean you're saying a medication that's

2642
01:58:30,511 --> 01:58:35,511
necessary,
but is that just your body telling you 

2643
01:58:35,511 --> 01:58:36,150
to hang it up?
Is that your body's saying like,

2644
01:58:36,151 --> 01:58:36,620
Hey,
you know,

2645
01:58:36,690 --> 01:58:39,840
look if you want to do testosterone for 
something else for life,

2646
01:58:39,841 --> 01:58:44,841
but if your body from the abuse of 
fighting is your,

2647
01:58:45,550 --> 01:58:48,010
you essentially your pituitary is not 
functioning properly.

2648
01:58:48,011 --> 01:58:50,700
That could be a big part of what's going
on and getting hit.

2649
01:58:50,870 --> 01:58:53,080
I get the arguments,
but you could say the same things.

2650
01:58:53,080 --> 01:58:56,750
If you need surgery and you.
Let's say you need insulin,

2651
01:58:56,760 --> 01:58:58,790
you develop type one,
type two,

2652
01:58:58,791 --> 01:59:01,080
type II diabetics.
Never fighting them.

2653
01:59:01,081 --> 01:59:03,880
I may though do that.
None of one or two.

2654
01:59:03,881 --> 01:59:04,720
But in general,
no.

2655
01:59:04,721 --> 01:59:06,020
But let's just,
if we're gonna,

2656
01:59:06,070 --> 01:59:07,440
if we're gonna go down this road,
right?

2657
01:59:07,441 --> 01:59:07,990
Say,
okay,

2658
01:59:08,320 --> 01:59:13,320
should you take this medication because 
you have a harder with me or something 

2659
01:59:13,320 --> 01:59:13,320
like that.
Um,

2660
01:59:13,320 --> 01:59:16,300
there's a whole bunch of things that go 
yet we have medications for this reason.

2661
01:59:16,630 --> 01:59:18,700
Unfortunately the line gets blurred so 
quickly.

2662
01:59:18,701 --> 01:59:20,860
You have a guy like Dan who was honest 
about it,

2663
01:59:20,861 --> 01:59:23,110
who went through the channels before we 
did anything,

2664
01:59:23,550 --> 01:59:26,380
talk to the UFC,
talk to the commission.

2665
01:59:26,410 --> 01:59:31,410
I had a when we wait and hit a binder of
every single had every single test done 

2666
01:59:32,201 --> 01:59:37,201
that day.
So we were very well prepared for that 

2667
01:59:37,201 --> 01:59:37,201
one.
So in that sense,

2668
01:59:37,201 --> 01:59:40,861
no,
I think that guys should absolutely be 

2669
01:59:40,861 --> 01:59:40,861
able to.

2670
01:59:40,861 --> 01:59:43,470
And Dan was one of the first,
I think Dan was the first or second 

2671
01:59:43,470 --> 01:59:46,800
therapeutic use exemption in Nevada.
And then came the controversy,

2672
01:59:47,680 --> 01:59:52,680
you know,
slowly necessarily what's up guys 

2673
01:59:52,680 --> 01:59:52,680
abusing it was abuse it.
Yeah.

2674
01:59:52,680 --> 01:59:54,820
Slowly but surely we started seeing guys
get tested.

2675
01:59:54,821 --> 01:59:59,821
Nate Marquardt,
they pull them off with the fight where 

2676
01:59:59,821 --> 01:59:59,821
they,
in their words,

2677
01:59:59,821 --> 02:00:04,680
dangerously high.
He had a dangerously high testosterone 

2678
02:00:04,680 --> 02:00:04,680
count.
Mean I don't know what the number was,

2679
02:00:04,680 --> 02:00:08,260
but apparently it was significant enough
that a doctor advised him to not be able

2680
02:00:08,261 --> 02:00:10,030
to compete.
Was pretty shocking,

2681
02:00:10,470 --> 02:00:12,130
you know,
there were certain number,

2682
02:00:12,190 --> 02:00:14,380
I don't know what that number and what 
are they worried about?

2683
02:00:14,410 --> 02:00:15,880
They're worried about his opponent or 
him.

2684
02:00:15,910 --> 02:00:16,910
It's a good question.
Is it?

2685
02:00:16,960 --> 02:00:17,860
Well,
first of all,

2686
02:00:17,920 --> 02:00:20,590
is this ignorance,
was the guy in Pennsylvania,

2687
02:00:20,860 --> 02:00:23,260
was he just ignorant to testosterone 
replacement?

2688
02:00:23,261 --> 02:00:26,230
Did he not understand that there was no 
nate to mark?

2689
02:00:26,260 --> 02:00:27,310
Mark Doers?
No.

2690
02:00:27,311 --> 02:00:31,030
I'm a worry about Mark Hartz health or 
was he right?

2691
02:00:31,140 --> 02:00:31,870
You know,
I don't know.

2692
02:00:31,871 --> 02:00:34,860
I'm not a doctor obviously who.
I don't know what the number was and.

2693
02:00:34,930 --> 02:00:39,930
But I do know that the guy literally 
said this is dangerous because a 

2694
02:00:39,930 --> 02:00:42,580
dangerous line,
unfortunately since I don't know the 50s

2695
02:00:42,581 --> 02:00:45,580
or 60s,
steroids have been involved with,

2696
02:00:45,610 --> 02:00:49,030
with sports and the higher the level of 
the more stakes there are,

2697
02:00:49,031 --> 02:00:51,310
the more chances you're going to see 
this abuse.

2698
02:00:51,400 --> 02:00:52,600
So in a perfect world,
no,

2699
02:00:52,601 --> 02:00:55,330
I think I should be able to take it.
Everyone's going to be honest.

2700
02:00:55,331 --> 02:01:00,331
You're not gonna,
you're not gonna go over all that stuff 

2701
02:01:00,331 --> 02:01:00,331
and voice.
That just doesn't happen.

2702
02:01:00,331 --> 02:01:03,960
No.
Do you think that guy should be able to 

2703
02:01:03,960 --> 02:01:04,900
take it just because everybody should be
able to recover at a in a sort of like a

2704
02:01:04,901 --> 02:01:09,090
seemingly healthy normal way and some 
people are just,

2705
02:01:09,280 --> 02:01:14,280
they have some sort of a natural 
impediment and they should be able to 

2706
02:01:14,280 --> 02:01:14,280
overcome that natural impediment with 
science?

2707
02:01:14,890 --> 02:01:18,160
That's the argument I guess so because 
it doesn't make you better.

2708
02:01:18,161 --> 02:01:21,340
What makes you better as hard work,
but it allows you to work harder because

2709
02:01:21,341 --> 02:01:23,470
it allows you to recover better in a 
sense.

2710
02:01:23,471 --> 02:01:26,380
Doesn't near squeezy pants,
doesn't allow you to work harder because

2711
02:01:26,381 --> 02:01:28,810
it was recover.
Where do you draw that line?

2712
02:01:28,811 --> 02:01:33,811
Right,
and unfortunately it's become such a 

2713
02:01:33,811 --> 02:01:35,851
taboo topic right now that in reality 
drugs are going to be part of every 

2714
02:01:38,591 --> 02:01:43,591
sport from 40 years ago to is our 
grandchildren's as far as we go into the

2715
02:01:44,841 --> 02:01:46,100
future.
It's going to happen.

2716
02:01:46,130 --> 02:01:46,430
Right?

2717
02:01:46,580 --> 02:01:49,610
Why do people take vitamin supplements?
Why do people take minerals?

2718
02:01:49,611 --> 02:01:51,800
Why do people take glutamine,
glutamine,

2719
02:01:51,801 --> 02:01:53,410
why do people take creatine?
Well,

2720
02:01:53,420 --> 02:01:58,420
they take all these legal supplements 
because they give you a slight edge on 

2721
02:01:58,420 --> 02:02:02,231
all of them together synergistically and
combine that edge and it gives you a 

2722
02:02:02,231 --> 02:02:03,440
little gap.
That little gap.

2723
02:02:03,470 --> 02:02:04,670
We've experienced it.
I mean,

2724
02:02:04,671 --> 02:02:09,671
I,
there's stuff that we sell it on it 

2725
02:02:09,671 --> 02:02:10,340
that's fucking a hundred percent legal,
but we'll give you a boost that,

2726
02:02:10,370 --> 02:02:11,000
that,
um,

2727
02:02:11,060 --> 02:02:14,390
cordyceps mushroom supplement.
Have you tried shroom tech?

2728
02:02:14,570 --> 02:02:19,570
Have you ever used that?
I gotta give her some of this shit is 

2729
02:02:19,570 --> 02:02:19,570
fucking incredible for oxygen 
utilization.

2730
02:02:19,570 --> 02:02:22,220
It gives you like an extra gear that 
gives you another round.

2731
02:02:22,221 --> 02:02:24,320
You'll give me another round and another
burst of energy.

2732
02:02:24,560 --> 02:02:26,720
Totally legal and it's nutritional 
thing.

2733
02:02:26,721 --> 02:02:30,320
It's quite some mushrooms and 
[inaudible] and we know that [inaudible]

2734
02:02:30,350 --> 02:02:32,090
gives people a boost of energy.

2735
02:02:32,090 --> 02:02:37,090
We know that people have been doing b,
12 injections before wrestling matches 

2736
02:02:37,090 --> 02:02:38,480
and all sorts of competitions for the 
longest time.

2737
02:02:38,481 --> 02:02:40,310
Completely legal.
We booked.

2738
02:02:40,311 --> 02:02:42,800
They do because it's effective.
It should that be illegal.

2739
02:02:43,740 --> 02:02:45,440
Where do you draw the line?
Where do you draw the line?

2740
02:02:45,441 --> 02:02:47,600
If you cannot be [inaudible] can you 
have a b,

2741
02:02:47,601 --> 02:02:48,190
12?
No,

2742
02:02:48,191 --> 02:02:48,800
no,
12.

2743
02:02:49,130 --> 02:02:51,830
Can I take a multivitamin or what the 
fuck?

2744
02:02:52,610 --> 02:02:53,910
What are we doing here?
Like what?

2745
02:02:54,290 --> 02:02:59,290
Where is the line?
And I think the line's always moving at 

2746
02:02:59,290 --> 02:03:02,561
one point in time they allow the 
testosterone and now after veto or 

2747
02:03:02,561 --> 02:03:05,910
tested at 1,475.
Yeah,

2748
02:03:06,560 --> 02:03:07,460
that's on it.
That's like,

2749
02:03:07,461 --> 02:03:09,170
oh,
that's not even a person.

2750
02:03:09,470 --> 02:03:10,610
You know,
that's some new thing.

2751
02:03:10,810 --> 02:03:15,810
I'd like to feel that.
It's like just raging with that crazy 

2752
02:03:17,171 --> 02:03:22,171
hair cut off is at 1,475.
Just pop out of the bed in the morning 

2753
02:03:22,171 --> 02:03:25,690
and in dance you do some prayers and 
then just start fucking running hills.

2754
02:03:25,691 --> 02:03:26,560
Yeah,
I would love that.

2755
02:03:26,890 --> 02:03:27,820
Yeah.
Maybe.

2756
02:03:28,360 --> 02:03:32,980
I don't know if there was no 
repercussions to that for sure.

2757
02:03:32,981 --> 02:03:35,190
I mean I want to feel that there must be
repercussions.

2758
02:03:35,300 --> 02:03:35,910
So.
Right.

2759
02:03:36,250 --> 02:03:38,200
That's the other thing too,
is I tell guys all the time,

2760
02:03:38,530 --> 02:03:40,870
if you're going to start messing around 
with your endocrine system,

2761
02:03:41,410 --> 02:03:46,410
go talk to an expert.
Don't take this stuff that Tony at the 

2762
02:03:46,410 --> 02:03:47,920
Jim gave you.
Go really go find someone who knows,

2763
02:03:47,950 --> 02:03:49,780
says get blood tests,
get regular work to.

2764
02:03:49,781 --> 02:03:52,120
Of course that falls on deaf ears most 
of the time.

2765
02:03:53,410 --> 02:03:58,410
Yeah,
it does fall and there's a reality also 

2766
02:03:58,410 --> 02:04:00,280
that you can only get so big naturally.

2767
02:04:00,670 --> 02:04:03,130
Like when you see a guy who's gained 40 
pounds in a year,

2768
02:04:03,430 --> 02:04:08,430
your eyebrows should go look at the size
of like a defensive line of an NFL team 

2769
02:04:08,531 --> 02:04:12,790
in 1975 and look what they weigh now.
And what do you think about,

2770
02:04:13,090 --> 02:04:16,150
do you think that some of them is just 
genetic engineering?

2771
02:04:16,370 --> 02:04:21,370
You know like now I mean in the sense 
that like big guys have chosen big women

2772
02:04:21,670 --> 02:04:26,670
and have fucked and made babies that 
people are bigger now than they've ever 

2773
02:04:26,670 --> 02:04:27,550
been.
Shoe sizes are bigger now than they were

2774
02:04:27,551 --> 02:04:32,551
20 years ago and also hormones in food,
they really do believe that that is 

2775
02:04:32,651 --> 02:04:35,830
having an impact of caloric intake as 
well.

2776
02:04:35,831 --> 02:04:38,640
So if you're eating tons calories at a 
young age,

2777
02:04:39,150 --> 02:04:41,740
you know your body's going to go into 
puberty quicker and then you just,

2778
02:04:41,800 --> 02:04:43,830
you secrete more growth hormone and you 
get bigger.

2779
02:04:44,160 --> 02:04:49,160
So that's why the average foot size over
the past 20 years is bigger than it was 

2780
02:04:49,160 --> 02:04:50,880
before.
So that plays a factor in,

2781
02:04:51,060 --> 02:04:53,280
but now the NFL is going to test for 
growth hormone.

2782
02:04:53,281 --> 02:04:56,940
That's supposedly they're going to do.
I know a guy who supplied a bunch of nfl

2783
02:04:56,941 --> 02:04:58,740
players with stuff and he just basically
said,

2784
02:04:58,741 --> 02:05:01,050
yeah,
everybody is like you can't do.

2785
02:05:01,320 --> 02:05:06,320
You can't have a 330 pound guy running 
into you and be able to get recovered 

2786
02:05:07,201 --> 02:05:09,030
again for next week.
You just can't do it.

2787
02:05:09,540 --> 02:05:11,340
We,
but we want to see that the Olympics,

2788
02:05:11,341 --> 02:05:13,620
I want to see Olympic records being 
shattered.

2789
02:05:13,680 --> 02:05:15,210
Well,
you get to a point,

2790
02:05:15,650 --> 02:05:18,000
if I'm watching a hundred meter sprint,
you really can't.

2791
02:05:18,030 --> 02:05:23,030
There's a physiological limit that 
you're going to get to that when drugs 

2792
02:05:23,030 --> 02:05:27,471
will help push it.
And this fence we don't like to talk 

2793
02:05:27,471 --> 02:05:27,471
about,
but you all want to see it.

2794
02:05:27,471 --> 02:05:30,800
I want to see home runs.
If I watch a baseball game while I have 

2795
02:05:30,800 --> 02:05:32,310
this ridiculous idea,
once I thought I was like,

2796
02:05:32,311 --> 02:05:35,220
how high can I jump?
I can jump like,

2797
02:05:35,390 --> 02:05:36,210
you know,
this high,

2798
02:05:36,240 --> 02:05:37,290
whatever it is.
I'm like,

2799
02:05:37,291 --> 02:05:40,230
this one I'm going to do,
I'm going to take a pencil and I'm going

2800
02:05:40,231 --> 02:05:45,231
to jump up as high as I can and I'm 
going to scratch the wall with his 

2801
02:05:45,231 --> 02:05:45,231
pencil scratch,
scratcher post this pencil,

2802
02:05:45,231 --> 02:05:48,350
but I'm just going to do it every day,
so if I just keep jumping,

2803
02:05:48,360 --> 02:05:50,040
I'll get better.
I'll get stronger.

2804
02:05:50,070 --> 02:05:55,070
If I keep jumping,
eventually I'll just jump out of the 

2805
02:05:55,070 --> 02:05:55,070
fucking roof.
I was like,

2806
02:05:55,070 --> 02:05:55,070
no,
is not.

2807
02:05:55,070 --> 02:05:58,740
There's a point of diminishing returns.
Is there a point where you just,

2808
02:05:58,770 --> 02:06:01,860
you're not going to jump any higher.
It doesn't matter how much you practice.

2809
02:06:01,861 --> 02:06:02,970
It doesn't matter how much you work out.

2810
02:06:03,240 --> 02:06:08,240
There's the the load limit on your knees
and your hips and your muscles and your 

2811
02:06:08,240 --> 02:06:08,240
tendons and ligaments.
Yeah,

2812
02:06:08,790 --> 02:06:09,090
well,
yeah,

2813
02:06:09,091 --> 02:06:11,310
I'd be jumping everyday for fucking 30 
years.

2814
02:06:11,630 --> 02:06:12,420
I like,
goddammit,

2815
02:06:12,450 --> 02:06:15,030
I can't clear this one mark that I made 
and it's just,

2816
02:06:15,031 --> 02:06:16,170
no,
it doesn't work that way.

2817
02:06:16,410 --> 02:06:18,890
The body has limitations.
Then there's.

2818
02:06:19,560 --> 02:06:20,920
I guess the flip side is,
yeah,

2819
02:06:21,020 --> 02:06:22,800
the format model is the greatest 
example.

2820
02:06:22,801 --> 02:06:27,801
You know Roger Bannister,
no one can break the four minute while 

2821
02:06:27,801 --> 02:06:29,350
he does it and then like the next year,
like 12 people do it in the next year,

2822
02:06:29,710 --> 02:06:31,770
25 people do it now.
There's high school kids.

2823
02:06:31,771 --> 02:06:36,080
He'll run under that power of belief 
plays.

2824
02:06:36,160 --> 02:06:38,250
Is that counterbalance to this whole 
argument?

2825
02:06:38,270 --> 02:06:43,270
Yeah.
Why do you think the NFL even wants 

2826
02:06:43,270 --> 02:06:43,700
people to be tested for human growth 
hormone?

2827
02:06:43,760 --> 02:06:48,760
Sure.
They don't know who the fuck is 

2828
02:06:48,760 --> 02:06:48,760
pressuring them.
Society.

2829
02:06:48,760 --> 02:06:48,780
I don't know why they should go.

2830
02:06:48,780 --> 02:06:53,780
What?
A few games on Sunday today click hang 

2831
02:06:53,780 --> 02:06:54,750
up the phone.
Who says that to say that we're going to

2832
02:06:54,751 --> 02:06:59,751
test and then they actually follow 
through and tests are two different 

2833
02:06:59,751 --> 02:07:02,691
things.
We're going to test everyone because if 

2834
02:07:02,691 --> 02:07:05,271
I say Joe on Thursday or income test,
you went meaning today's Monday,

2835
02:07:07,111 --> 02:07:12,111
so you do your last shot and midnight on
Wednesday night and then you're good to 

2836
02:07:12,111 --> 02:07:15,030
go because really the.
Even if you fail it,

2837
02:07:15,031 --> 02:07:18,270
I've always said this,
you feel a drug test in mma means you're

2838
02:07:18,271 --> 02:07:21,000
an idiot.
Well not anymore.

2839
02:07:21,510 --> 02:07:25,920
Now they're doing this like really 
strict protocol that's like $40,000

2840
02:07:25,921 --> 02:07:28,530
a test in there.
That's how chill got popped.

2841
02:07:28,531 --> 02:07:31,140
I mean,
they're testing for EPO and human growth

2842
02:07:31,141 --> 02:07:35,320
hormone is always around that stuff.
I mean really the guys you do?

2843
02:07:35,330 --> 02:07:36,040
Yeah,
of course.

2844
02:07:36,130 --> 02:07:41,130
Have you seen these new tasks?
They'll spot human growth hormone three 

2845
02:07:41,130 --> 02:07:41,130
weeks out.

2846
02:07:41,130 --> 02:07:43,170
New tasks apparently stopped taking it 
three and a half way,

2847
02:07:43,220 --> 02:07:48,220
but whatever the numbers are,
you're going to have athletes who will 

2848
02:07:48,220 --> 02:07:49,360
always find a way to get around things 
into cheat.

2849
02:07:49,420 --> 02:07:54,420
It's always going.
It's always happened in the the WHO's 

2850
02:07:54,420 --> 02:07:57,811
ever doing the drugs she's ever supply 
and they're always one step ahead with 

2851
02:07:57,811 --> 02:08:00,961
the testers would.
If a guy had to have a camera set up 

2852
02:08:01,150 --> 02:08:05,830
like on a Webcam and everyday he has to 
take us of a finger prick.

2853
02:08:06,100 --> 02:08:09,460
Like you have a home sensor machine and 
you see people do it.

2854
02:08:09,461 --> 02:08:11,890
You take your fingerprint,
you put it on.

2855
02:08:11,891 --> 02:08:16,891
Like this home sensor machine sensor 
recognizes your fingerprint that's 

2856
02:08:16,891 --> 02:08:21,141
giving this blood sample.
It analyzes a sample without any input 

2857
02:08:21,141 --> 02:08:25,681
from you whatsoever,
and their results immediately go to a 

2858
02:08:25,681 --> 02:08:25,681
lab.
So you have to do it every day.

2859
02:08:25,681 --> 02:08:25,990
If you're competing now,
that'd be great.

2860
02:08:26,610 --> 02:08:29,670
To fake finger.
Someone fell,

2861
02:08:29,680 --> 02:08:30,280
right?
Yeah.

2862
02:08:30,340 --> 02:08:35,340
They'll figure out a way to fucking have
a big dick sat there that you can put 

2863
02:08:35,471 --> 02:08:37,870
someone else's urine and some will come 
up with a fake fingerprint.

2864
02:08:37,900 --> 02:08:40,780
Didn't randleman do that then use the 
flight deck.

2865
02:08:41,320 --> 02:08:46,320
Was it him or was it someone did tom 
sizemore got busted using the fake Dick 

2866
02:08:46,320 --> 02:08:50,760
who was trying to escape from some sort 
of a DNA check that in your luggage and 

2867
02:08:50,910 --> 02:08:54,130
your pants all the time and you just 
hope they don't check.

2868
02:08:54,640 --> 02:08:59,640
I mean,
imagine if someone that's not even a 

2869
02:08:59,640 --> 02:08:59,640
real deck and start yanking on your desk
like,

2870
02:08:59,640 --> 02:08:59,640
Hey,
it is isn't real.

2871
02:08:59,640 --> 02:09:01,840
Dick Tsa.
Yeah.

2872
02:09:02,150 --> 02:09:03,160
Um,
yeah they do have.

2873
02:09:03,161 --> 02:09:05,790
They have rubber ducks.
Nuts.

2874
02:09:05,920 --> 02:09:07,640
Yeah.
I like,

2875
02:09:07,710 --> 02:09:09,850
I liked the,
I like the testing.

2876
02:09:09,910 --> 02:09:14,910
I think that's good particularly because
I have athletes that don't use any 

2877
02:09:14,910 --> 02:09:18,181
drugs,
so I prefer to keep everything as clean 

2878
02:09:18,181 --> 02:09:18,181
as possible.

2879
02:09:18,181 --> 02:09:19,420
But did you get bummed out when they 
pulled the testosterone replacement?

2880
02:09:19,421 --> 02:09:22,980
Because if you were a guy like say you 
don't handle them anymore,

2881
02:09:22,990 --> 02:09:27,160
but if you were handling dance career 
and all of a sudden and Dan,

2882
02:09:27,161 --> 02:09:29,110
the guy who did it ethically and was 
taking,

2883
02:09:29,200 --> 02:09:31,540
you know exactly what he should be 
taking,

2884
02:09:31,550 --> 02:09:36,550
do it all by the rules and then they,
they pull it because one guy or a few 

2885
02:09:36,550 --> 02:09:40,390
guys or whatever was abusing it.
It's a challenge for sure.

2886
02:09:41,340 --> 02:09:42,670
You just have to find a way,
right?

2887
02:09:42,671 --> 02:09:44,650
You have to adjust training.
You have to go back and go,

2888
02:09:44,651 --> 02:09:45,890
okay,
now we need to.

2889
02:09:45,910 --> 02:09:47,910
We have to rethink what we're doing and 
how we're doing.

2890
02:09:47,980 --> 02:09:50,620
So we have to pull back on the training.
You have to do less.

2891
02:09:51,070 --> 02:09:54,160
Maybe shorter intensity.
Maybe we.

2892
02:09:54,190 --> 02:09:56,560
Maybe the camp instead of eight weeks is
six weeks.

2893
02:09:56,620 --> 02:10:00,010
He just changes change the strategy.
And what about is there any,

2894
02:10:00,630 --> 02:10:03,160
any shortcuts to recovery other than 
those pants?

2895
02:10:03,161 --> 02:10:06,280
The squeezy things?
Is there anything else and rest.

2896
02:10:06,281 --> 02:10:08,020
And then the biggest thing is staying in
shape.

2897
02:10:08,720 --> 02:10:11,710
The one thing that randy did better than
when he was always in shape,

2898
02:10:12,880 --> 02:10:16,420
so whatever else never injured that you 
know.

2899
02:10:16,440 --> 02:10:18,520
Do you know Peter Graham?
He's a kickboxer.

2900
02:10:18,540 --> 02:10:20,110
Here comes another one.
He's 30,

2901
02:10:20,111 --> 02:10:25,111
probably 37.
He's been competing at a high level for 

2902
02:10:25,111 --> 02:10:29,041
20 years.
He's never had an injury that's causing 

2903
02:10:29,041 --> 02:10:29,041
him to miss training or fight.
It's incredible.

2904
02:10:29,041 --> 02:10:31,390
When you look at athletes,
most people,

2905
02:10:31,391 --> 02:10:32,080
again,
we go back to,

2906
02:10:32,081 --> 02:10:33,890
is there ever going to be enough talent?
Well,

2907
02:10:33,891 --> 02:10:38,891
most people,
their bodies can't handle the stress of 

2908
02:10:38,891 --> 02:10:38,891
training.
I can't.

2909
02:10:38,891 --> 02:10:43,481
My neck went at 21 or 22 herniated disc 
and then all of a sudden things are done

2910
02:10:44,390 --> 02:10:49,390
right,
so you have to have a particular joint 

2911
02:10:49,390 --> 02:10:49,670
structure,
bone structure,

2912
02:10:49,671 --> 02:10:54,671
musculature that your body can withstand
years of pounding and pounding and 

2913
02:10:54,671 --> 02:10:54,671
pounding.

2914
02:10:54,671 --> 02:10:57,290
That's one thing they mentally have to 
be able to stay in the game.

2915
02:10:57,590 --> 02:10:59,630
If you get rich and famous,
can you handle that?

2916
02:10:59,631 --> 02:11:01,290
Well,
that rules that most people are there,

2917
02:11:01,291 --> 02:11:06,291
you're going to go off the rails anyways
and then you can surround yourself with 

2918
02:11:06,291 --> 02:11:09,851
the right people.
All these certain things have to happen 

2919
02:11:09,851 --> 02:11:12,940
for you to achieve this level of success
and that's very difficult that those 

2920
02:11:12,940 --> 02:11:16,631
come through and within mma may,
it's the lowest barrier for entry than 

2921
02:11:16,631 --> 02:11:20,051
any professional sport.
You could take a guy off the street and 

2922
02:11:20,051 --> 02:11:20,051
said,
do you want to be a pro MMA fighter?

2923
02:11:20,051 --> 02:11:21,360
You could go to a local promoter in 
sale,

2924
02:11:21,361 --> 02:11:23,390
sell 40 tickets,
and he'll get you a fight.

2925
02:11:24,250 --> 02:11:26,690
That does happen.
It happens all the time.

2926
02:11:27,180 --> 02:11:32,180
Especially in those old school like 
Indian casino fights these to have in 

2927
02:11:32,180 --> 02:11:35,270
California when there was no,
they still go on.

2928
02:11:35,390 --> 02:11:36,050
Oh yeah,
yeah.

2929
02:11:36,051 --> 02:11:37,340
In California,
they still go on.

2930
02:11:37,410 --> 02:11:39,290
Even though it's sanctioned,
sanctioned,

2931
02:11:39,291 --> 02:11:44,291
they still do these sort of off brand 
promotions where they have these guys 

2932
02:11:44,421 --> 02:11:46,910
that are just fucking completely 
inexperienced,

2933
02:11:46,911 --> 02:11:50,030
have no business being there,
so the barrier for entry is very low,

2934
02:11:50,330 --> 02:11:55,330
but really finding quality people,
quality athletes so you can because you 

2935
02:11:55,330 --> 02:11:56,960
have to invest in people to.
It costs money to do this.

2936
02:11:57,290 --> 02:11:58,430
That's the one thing we didn't talk 
about.

2937
02:11:58,431 --> 02:11:59,870
If you're going to have someone go,
okay,

2938
02:12:00,110 --> 02:12:01,040
Joe,
all of your,

2939
02:12:01,100 --> 02:12:06,100
all of your transactions are going to be
private training sessions so you get 

2940
02:12:06,100 --> 02:12:06,950
exactly what you need for that day,
but that doesn't come cheap either,

2941
02:12:07,250 --> 02:12:09,230
so you have to really make investments 
in people.

2942
02:12:09,231 --> 02:12:14,231
To me,
someone will come along that really 

2943
02:12:14,231 --> 02:12:15,551
wants to start investing in developing 
athletes and then brands will start 

2944
02:12:16,131 --> 02:12:20,190
linking up to that because right now,
even with the sponsors,

2945
02:12:20,191 --> 02:12:21,680
uh,
things no one really knows.

2946
02:12:21,680 --> 02:12:24,230
Don't really wants to touch an MMA 
fighter so much.

2947
02:12:24,740 --> 02:12:29,740
But if you look at value for the money 
and the value and the exposure that 

2948
02:12:29,740 --> 02:12:30,530
these kids get in and the platform that 
the UFC is created,

2949
02:12:30,760 --> 02:12:35,760
there's a ton of value here that,
that most brands are not taking 

2950
02:12:35,760 --> 02:12:39,491
advantage of.
But there's also issues like Nike was 

2951
02:12:39,491 --> 02:12:42,071
sponsoring Jones and then Jones had that
crazy bra with cormier and then they 

2952
02:12:42,071 --> 02:12:46,070
pull the sponsorship loss on his side.
I mean,

2953
02:12:46,071 --> 02:12:48,380
I don't know how much they were paying 
them how to be six figures.

2954
02:12:48,740 --> 02:12:50,570
I don't know what it was,
but that's a.

2955
02:12:50,630 --> 02:12:55,630
it's also,
there's a big cache to be sponsored by 

2956
02:12:55,630 --> 02:12:56,060
Nike,
you know,

2957
02:12:56,061 --> 02:12:57,030
one of the,
you know,

2958
02:12:57,050 --> 02:13:02,050
whatever fortune 500 companies that are 
even considering maybe getting a raise 

2959
02:13:02,050 --> 02:13:05,891
gay ready to fortune 500 company.
They might be probably and they were 

2960
02:13:05,891 --> 02:13:09,311
handling big.
We're promoting George Saint Pierre for 

2961
02:13:09,311 --> 02:13:11,890
awhile or sponsoring him.
So it's like there's a couple of those 

2962
02:13:11,890 --> 02:13:16,241
like really?
Do you think it was just the brawler 

2963
02:13:16,241 --> 02:13:16,970
there other things as well because he 
hasn't done a great job on social media.

2964
02:13:17,080 --> 02:13:18,620
No.
So to me it's,

2965
02:13:18,910 --> 02:13:21,680
that's why you have to help someone 
understand how they fit in,

2966
02:13:21,681 --> 02:13:23,930
how to craft this image.
Look at Saint Pierre.

2967
02:13:23,960 --> 02:13:24,230
I mean,
he said,

2968
02:13:24,231 --> 02:13:29,231
how long has he been around for?
Ever heard of one bit of dirt on George 

2969
02:13:29,231 --> 02:13:29,231
Saint Pierre?
Well,

2970
02:13:29,231 --> 02:13:32,190
you know,
nothing that can't be a debated.

2971
02:13:32,270 --> 02:13:32,840
You know,
the,

2972
02:13:32,841 --> 02:13:34,920
the,
the issues with his former manager,

2973
02:13:34,921 --> 02:13:39,921
you know,
there's a big lawsuit that was going on 

2974
02:13:39,921 --> 02:13:42,040
where he'd left his former manager,
but I been around as far former manager 

2975
02:13:42,040 --> 02:13:42,720
and his former manager's husband and 
there was just,

2976
02:13:43,060 --> 02:13:44,550
there's a lot of weirdness going on 
there.

2977
02:13:44,551 --> 02:13:49,551
That was the good,
the guy that used to call the witch 

2978
02:13:49,551 --> 02:13:51,060
doctor,
I remember that he was rubbing on 

2979
02:13:51,060 --> 02:13:52,080
people's chests and aligning their 
shockers and all our ah,

2980
02:13:52,140 --> 02:13:57,140
what but for said a career like he has.
You haven't seen any weird media things.

2981
02:13:57,241 --> 02:13:59,220
Great Guy.
He's a legitimately great guy.

2982
02:13:59,260 --> 02:13:59,790
Yeah.
Yeah.

2983
02:13:59,791 --> 02:14:01,650
John is a wild motherfucker,
you know,

2984
02:14:01,651 --> 02:14:06,651
and as much as he would like to contain 
it and have everybody think that he's 

2985
02:14:06,651 --> 02:14:10,790
like Super Uber Professional,
one of the reasons why he's so fucking 

2986
02:14:10,790 --> 02:14:14,961
good is because he's so wild.
That's why he's willing to throw 

2987
02:14:14,961 --> 02:14:16,110
spinning elbows in there and do all 
kinds of wild,

2988
02:14:16,111 --> 02:14:21,111
crazy shit and hit a jumping flying knee
on show gun two seconds into their fight

2989
02:14:21,571 --> 02:14:22,320
for the title.

2990
02:14:22,520 --> 02:14:27,520
Know he's a wild dude.
And that's the kind of guy that becomes 

2991
02:14:27,520 --> 02:14:27,520
a champion.
I mean,

2992
02:14:27,520 --> 02:14:29,400
that's just the way it is.
A fine line there.

2993
02:14:29,430 --> 02:14:30,290
Yeah,
yeah,

2994
02:14:30,291 --> 02:14:35,291
yeah.
And sometimes you drive drunk and a 

2995
02:14:35,291 --> 02:14:35,291
Bentley with a bunch of strippers in 
your lap.

2996
02:14:35,291 --> 02:14:37,350
There's just those kinds of guys.
That's,

2997
02:14:37,410 --> 02:14:38,850
that's Jack Johnson,
you know,

2998
02:14:38,851 --> 02:14:40,650
that's fucking,
that's a,

2999
02:14:40,680 --> 02:14:45,680
that's Jack Dempsey.
That's the wild motherfuckers and while 

3000
02:14:45,680 --> 02:14:48,070
that's Mike Tyson in his prime wild 
motherfuckers,

3001
02:14:48,071 --> 02:14:51,060
while motherfuckers make great fighters,
but you know,

3002
02:14:51,061 --> 02:14:56,061
if you're a big corporation looking to 
keep a shiny image of smiling athletes 

3003
02:14:56,441 --> 02:14:58,320
who have beautiful white teeth,
you might not,

3004
02:14:58,560 --> 02:15:02,400
might not want to be associated with 
some dude who's going to start brawls at

3005
02:15:02,401 --> 02:15:04,230
a press conference,
you know,

3006
02:15:04,231 --> 02:15:09,231
and that's,
that's the reality of corporations 

3007
02:15:09,231 --> 02:15:11,480
looking to align themselves with cage 
fighters.

3008
02:15:11,481 --> 02:15:16,481
It's a challenge in this sport and 
hopefully that as a sport develops and 

3009
02:15:16,481 --> 02:15:20,871
athletes get better at dealing with the 
media and crafting ways to approach and 

3010
02:15:20,871 --> 02:15:22,200
deal with that,
then the more opportunities will come.

3011
02:15:22,590 --> 02:15:23,610
Yeah,
I hope so too.

3012
02:15:23,930 --> 02:15:28,930
You know,
and there's also people who are 

3013
02:15:28,930 --> 02:15:28,930
concerned that Emma might have plateaued
as well.

3014
02:15:28,930 --> 02:15:32,460
They're concerned that like with the Fox
sports,

3015
02:15:32,461 --> 02:15:37,461
one deal with the UFC on Fox and the UFC
having so many cards.

3016
02:15:37,740 --> 02:15:40,580
I mean there's cars constantly and 
there's a fight pass cards.

3017
02:15:40,581 --> 02:15:45,581
So there's international cards are 
sometimes two different cards going on 

3018
02:15:45,581 --> 02:15:48,711
at the same night.
There might be some sort of an 

3019
02:15:48,711 --> 02:15:49,440
oversaturation issue or that it doesn't.
It's not special anymore where it's like

3020
02:15:50,100 --> 02:15:52,980
boxing.
They'll have fights every now and again,

3021
02:15:52,981 --> 02:15:55,520
but you know,
there's a million different promoters,

3022
02:15:55,630 --> 02:15:57,560
Paul Barrons promoting,
you know,

3023
02:15:57,620 --> 02:16:02,620
the golden boys promoting is a bunch of 
different promotions that are going on 

3024
02:16:02,620 --> 02:16:05,960
in every x amount of months.
There's a big fight every x amount of 

3025
02:16:05,960 --> 02:16:06,920
months.
Floyd mayweather fight.

3026
02:16:07,040 --> 02:16:09,540
Miguel cotto,
you know Amir Khan,

3027
02:16:09,541 --> 02:16:14,541
like someone who has a big name and 
that'll be like a headliner marquee 

3028
02:16:14,541 --> 02:16:18,681
fights.
They suffer the same weakness that MMA 

3029
02:16:18,681 --> 02:16:21,180
does and that forever it will be,
will be talent.

3030
02:16:21,360 --> 02:16:26,360
Yeah.
I mean you could have the greatest 

3031
02:16:26,360 --> 02:16:28,211
distribution and all this,
but if you don't have a talented 

3032
02:16:28,211 --> 02:16:28,211
marketable athlete coming up,
you don't have anything.

3033
02:16:28,211 --> 02:16:28,920
So that's why.
To me,

3034
02:16:29,230 --> 02:16:30,160
development is the area

3035
02:16:30,160 --> 02:16:32,790
that's most neglected in this sport and 
it's.

3036
02:16:32,990 --> 02:16:36,340
It's the,
the foundation of the entire sport.

3037
02:16:36,341 --> 02:16:38,140
You have to have a guy who's gonna get 
excited,

3038
02:16:38,141 --> 02:16:39,760
who's going to be exciting.
It's going to win fights.

3039
02:16:39,780 --> 02:16:42,100
Exciting ways is going to handle the 
media well.

3040
02:16:42,101 --> 02:16:44,120
Who's going to sell pay per views?
That's,

3041
02:16:44,290 --> 02:16:47,140
that's everything.
Sports psychology.

3042
02:16:47,440 --> 02:16:48,200
Yeah.
You,

3043
02:16:48,250 --> 02:16:49,940
you guys work with the sports 
psychology?

3044
02:16:49,990 --> 02:16:50,500
We do,
yeah.

3045
02:16:50,501 --> 02:16:55,501
We work with a really good guy out of a 
cal state fullerton and works with a 

3046
02:16:55,501 --> 02:16:57,280
bunch of Olympic swimmers and he's been 
fantastic.

3047
02:16:57,490 --> 02:16:58,540
And do you.

3048
02:16:58,600 --> 02:17:02,830
I have everybody work with this guy or 
is it based on a need?

3049
02:17:03,370 --> 02:17:06,130
Is it a.
is it something that you have like.

3050
02:17:06,131 --> 02:17:11,131
Well,
you address it as part of this is this 

3051
02:17:11,131 --> 02:17:11,131
is one aspect of who you are as a 
fighter

3052
02:17:11,131 --> 02:17:13,420
mindset and we should maximize that 
mindset.

3053
02:17:13,480 --> 02:17:16,060
To me it's an important part of 
training.

3054
02:17:16,390 --> 02:17:20,230
I think everyone should work with 
someone on that side of things like what

3055
02:17:20,231 --> 02:17:25,231
does this sport psychologists do really 
helps them kind of frame what's going on

3056
02:17:25,601 --> 02:17:30,601
in their life in a positive way or to 
help them deal with the pressure and 

3057
02:17:30,601 --> 02:17:31,090
stress of competition.
Like what do they do?

3058
02:17:31,750 --> 02:17:35,140
I've never sit in on those sessions.
I'm not a sports psychologist,

3059
02:17:35,141 --> 02:17:38,080
but don't want to know.
So personal.

3060
02:17:38,081 --> 02:17:40,330
It's not my,
it's not my place to be there.

3061
02:17:40,630 --> 02:17:41,560
Whatever,
whatever.

3062
02:17:41,890 --> 02:17:46,890
I can't be there for everything and I 
want them to have an outlet that they 

3063
02:17:46,890 --> 02:17:48,430
can go to to talk about if there's 
stress of pressure,

3064
02:17:48,431 --> 02:17:51,010
they're feeling this feeling like that 
he's an expert in dealing with that.

3065
02:17:51,011 --> 02:17:54,670
I don't if they want to bring me in or 
ask me a question that I'm happy to,

3066
02:17:54,671 --> 02:17:56,200
but no,
I don't want to go sit in a session.

3067
02:17:56,260 --> 02:17:56,750
I've never seen

3068
02:17:56,800 --> 02:17:59,860
sat in with a sports psychologist or a 
psychologist,

3069
02:18:00,160 --> 02:18:04,540
but I think if it can work with 
professional athletes that have probably

3070
02:18:04,541 --> 02:18:09,541
worked with.
I thought about doing it for standup 

3071
02:18:09,541 --> 02:18:09,541
comedy.
Yeah.

3072
02:18:09,541 --> 02:18:11,260
Going with a sports psychologist to work
on standup comedy.

3073
02:18:11,261 --> 02:18:16,261
Like I wonder if there's something,
because comics are all like lone wolves 

3074
02:18:16,261 --> 02:18:20,431
all doing it on their own.
No one ever brings in people to help 

3075
02:18:20,431 --> 02:18:23,221
them with anything other than.
Occasionally comics will bring another 

3076
02:18:23,221 --> 02:18:24,040
comics as writers,
but I wonder like mindset,

3077
02:18:24,430 --> 02:18:26,950
that performance mindset.
It's a very important,

3078
02:18:27,040 --> 02:18:28,630
whether it's athletics or

3079
02:18:29,410 --> 02:18:31,610
athletics as a father,
a husband.

3080
02:18:31,611 --> 02:18:32,420
That's it.
Whatever.

3081
02:18:32,421 --> 02:18:33,140
Yeah,
for sure.

3082
02:18:33,560 --> 02:18:36,370
But you haven't done it now.
Now with this guy,

3083
02:18:36,371 --> 02:18:41,371
let's say he actually.
I have talked with him on a couple of 

3084
02:18:41,371 --> 02:18:41,371
occasions about,
okay,

3085
02:18:41,371 --> 02:18:42,350
during the fight week,
here are some things that that you might

3086
02:18:42,351 --> 02:18:44,660
want to stay away from saying more 
general stuff,

3087
02:18:44,720 --> 02:18:47,930
like what kind of stuff.
One thing he pointed out was that like,

3088
02:18:47,931 --> 02:18:49,520
it's a common thing to go,
how you doing?

3089
02:18:49,970 --> 02:18:52,460
How you doing today?
Don't do that with a fighter.

3090
02:18:53,270 --> 02:18:56,390
You can occasionally,
but there's kind of some built in things

3091
02:18:56,391 --> 02:18:57,170
here.
How am I doing?

3092
02:18:57,400 --> 02:19:01,280
Why hadn't thought about it?
Well my my shoulder kind of hurts.

3093
02:19:01,281 --> 02:19:04,160
It's like all of a sudden you start 
focusing off in that direction.

3094
02:19:04,250 --> 02:19:06,670
That gauge I told you about where we 
have negative.

3095
02:19:06,920 --> 02:19:10,380
That was all from him also.
I have it a close idea of negative.

3096
02:19:10,390 --> 02:19:11,820
I'll text it to you.
You can post it if you want.

3097
02:19:11,830 --> 02:19:12,740
I'll text it to you.
Okay.

3098
02:19:12,860 --> 02:19:14,390
It's super helpful.
It's actually,

3099
02:19:14,391 --> 02:19:17,930
I think it's my.
It's my screensaver gauge.

3100
02:19:18,230 --> 02:19:19,250
Yeah,
it's really helpful.

3101
02:19:19,251 --> 02:19:21,350
If you look,
I'll do it when we're done.

3102
02:19:23,100 --> 02:19:25,610
Yes or anything and I found this in 
Chiropractic to.

3103
02:19:25,620 --> 02:19:27,680
I learned this.
If I go back,

3104
02:19:27,681 --> 02:19:32,681
I walked onto.
I wrestled my senior year in high 

3105
02:19:32,681 --> 02:19:35,141
school,
separate my ac joints every half a year 

3106
02:19:35,141 --> 02:19:36,740
in high school and then walked on to 
Arizona state who at the time,

3107
02:19:36,741 --> 02:19:39,740
two years prior,
were the national champions of the team.

3108
02:19:39,741 --> 02:19:42,970
They took third the year before the son.
His kids were there,

3109
02:19:42,980 --> 02:19:47,980
so we're always Olympia.
It was as tough as a wrestling room 

3110
02:19:47,980 --> 02:19:48,980
could get and I had half a year of high 
school wrestling and I went in there and

3111
02:19:48,981 --> 02:19:53,981
got smashed for four months and then at 
the end of four months I could kind of 

3112
02:19:53,981 --> 02:19:56,600
keep up and survive,
but my mindset the whole time wasn't,

3113
02:19:56,630 --> 02:20:01,630
I'm coming here and when my mindset was 
I can hang with these guys and eight 

3114
02:20:01,630 --> 02:20:04,370
months later I would have a four three 
match with a returning all American,

3115
02:20:05,030 --> 02:20:10,030
but I never got a five for match and 
beat him because the mindset wasn't 

3116
02:20:10,030 --> 02:20:10,040
that.

3117
02:20:10,040 --> 02:20:12,050
The mindset was,
I can hang with these guys.

3118
02:20:12,530 --> 02:20:14,870
You have to be able to create a mindset.
We're going to go in there.

3119
02:20:14,871 --> 02:20:17,120
I'm going to dominate this guy in every 
single way,

3120
02:20:17,121 --> 02:20:22,121
every second of this fight,
and that is a whole different mindset 

3121
02:20:22,121 --> 02:20:23,450
that you have to develop.
Fast forward to my chiropractic years,

3122
02:20:23,451 --> 02:20:28,451
I saw this happen all the time.
I saw that people who had long standing 

3123
02:20:28,451 --> 02:20:32,711
musculoskeletal injuries,
there was always an emotional component 

3124
02:20:32,711 --> 02:20:35,711
to it.
Sometimes it was 99% woman came to see 

3125
02:20:35,711 --> 02:20:36,870
me and she was on some medication I'd 
never heard of.

3126
02:20:36,871 --> 02:20:37,140
I said,
well,

3127
02:20:37,141 --> 02:20:38,780
what is this for?
And she goes,

3128
02:20:38,781 --> 02:20:39,590
well,
I have.

3129
02:20:39,620 --> 02:20:41,000
I'm epileptic.
I have seizures.

3130
02:20:41,030 --> 02:20:41,530
I said,
oh,

3131
02:20:41,550 --> 02:20:42,740
okay.
Well tell me about them.

3132
02:20:43,100 --> 02:20:48,100
And I don't know why.
Something just didn't feel right about 

3133
02:20:48,100 --> 02:20:48,100
it.
So the more she talks,

3134
02:20:48,100 --> 02:20:49,760
the more questions I ask,
when did they happen?

3135
02:20:49,790 --> 02:20:50,750
She finally tells me,
well,

3136
02:20:50,751 --> 02:20:55,190
they happen whenever I see a frog,
which for you and I living in California

3137
02:20:55,191 --> 02:20:57,500
is not that big of a deal,
but she lived in north Queensland,

3138
02:20:57,501 --> 02:21:02,501
Australia.
She'd open her door and there'd be 10 

3139
02:21:02,501 --> 02:21:02,580
green tree frogs right there.
So somewhere along the line,

3140
02:21:02,600 --> 02:21:07,600
her brain,
she had a fear of frogs that linked up 

3141
02:21:07,600 --> 02:21:09,270
to this huge emotional response.
Green tree frogs poisonous or something.

3142
02:21:10,060 --> 02:21:15,060
They weren't just a green frog there and
her body would go into such a state that

3143
02:21:15,681 --> 02:21:18,050
she would have a seizure.
Frogs a rock.

3144
02:21:18,080 --> 02:21:20,990
She had this frog phobe so bad.
Sounds crazy,

3145
02:21:20,991 --> 02:21:23,360
right?
But this was her life if you think about

3146
02:21:23,361 --> 02:21:25,940
it.
So she couldn't go to barbecues,

3147
02:21:26,270 --> 02:21:28,310
which was in that part of the country 
was popular.

3148
02:21:28,311 --> 02:21:30,620
She couldn't go outside a whole lot.
She lives in the top.

3149
02:21:30,621 --> 02:21:32,300
I mean it affected her whole life.

3150
02:21:32,840 --> 02:21:36,290
So at the time I had started a reading 
it when I,

3151
02:21:36,291 --> 02:21:41,291
when I figured out how much of an 
emotional components is all these 

3152
02:21:41,291 --> 02:21:43,970
[inaudible] scene,
200 people a week and they come in with 

3153
02:21:43,970 --> 02:21:43,970
back pain.
He had talked to him more and it's like,

3154
02:21:43,970 --> 02:21:44,750
ah,
there's so much else going on.

3155
02:21:44,751 --> 02:21:46,670
It's not just your back pains,
the problem here,

3156
02:21:46,940 --> 02:21:49,240
it's the way that you're thinking and 
processing information.

3157
02:21:49,241 --> 02:21:50,990
It's kind of the psychology aspect to 
this.

3158
02:21:51,560 --> 02:21:54,680
So I started reading about this guy 
named Milton Erickson.

3159
02:21:54,681 --> 02:21:56,930
Milton Erickson was the founder of 
modern hypnosis,

3160
02:21:56,931 --> 02:22:01,931
one of the most amazing people ever,
and he would do speeches with 3000 

3161
02:22:01,931 --> 02:22:05,741
people in hypnotize a whole room,
and I always felt this connection with 

3162
02:22:05,741 --> 02:22:05,741
Milton Erickson.
He had the same birthday that I did.

3163
02:22:05,741 --> 02:22:07,910
He lived in Providence and Phoenix where
I lived,

3164
02:22:07,911 --> 02:22:12,911
and so there was these strategy books on
on how Milton Erickson would do this and

3165
02:22:14,001 --> 02:22:19,001
within this.
That kind of led me to doing some 

3166
02:22:19,001 --> 02:22:22,001
reading with Tony Robbins who had,
who had started with a system called 

3167
02:22:22,001 --> 02:22:26,951
neuro linguistics programming that was 
kind of founded a lot of the work that 

3168
02:22:26,951 --> 02:22:26,951
Milton Erickson had done.

3169
02:22:26,951 --> 02:22:31,850
Within all of this,
there's a strategy for helping someone 

3170
02:22:31,850 --> 02:22:31,850
break phobias.
So here I am,

3171
02:22:31,850 --> 02:22:33,210
26 years old,
completely intense,

3172
02:22:33,211 --> 02:22:35,820
and this woman comes to see me for the 
seizures,

3173
02:22:36,030 --> 02:22:38,070
this back pain and finds that she has 
seizures.

3174
02:22:38,640 --> 02:22:42,060
So I do this process with her.
It's kind of like this imagination thing

3175
02:22:42,061 --> 02:22:44,370
and you basically,
you break this neurological pattern that

3176
02:22:44,371 --> 02:22:45,510
happens.
I said,

3177
02:22:45,511 --> 02:22:47,760
you're going to go home today and you're
going to pick up a frog.

3178
02:22:48,210 --> 02:22:50,970
What?
And I get a call an hour later,

3179
02:22:51,210 --> 02:22:53,460
I get called on I or she picks up.
I said,

3180
02:22:53,461 --> 02:22:54,200
hello?
She goes,

3181
02:22:54,220 --> 02:22:54,900
Dr.
Parsons.

3182
02:22:55,110 --> 02:22:56,910
Yes.
I'm holding a frog.

3183
02:22:56,911 --> 02:22:57,420
No,
she goes,

3184
02:22:57,421 --> 02:22:59,370
I can't pick them up.
I said,

3185
02:22:59,371 --> 02:23:01,710
where are you right now?
Because I'm right in front of him.

3186
02:23:01,740 --> 02:23:02,580
I said,
how close?

3187
02:23:03,430 --> 02:23:04,290
She says,
two feet.

3188
02:23:05,400 --> 02:23:06,000
I said,
okay,

3189
02:23:06,060 --> 02:23:08,460
you'll pick them up tomorrow.
And I hung the phone.

3190
02:23:08,860 --> 02:23:12,690
Right.
So this is some Miyagi shit now.

3191
02:23:12,691 --> 02:23:14,040
Well,
it's not actually.

3192
02:23:14,041 --> 02:23:15,960
If you.
If you learn these patterns of,

3193
02:23:16,000 --> 02:23:18,750
of how you learn how to break someone's 
pattern,

3194
02:23:18,960 --> 02:23:21,000
you can create a whole different set of 
behavior right now.

3195
02:23:21,070 --> 02:23:25,450
What does this learning of how to break 
these patterns essentially based on what

3196
02:23:25,451 --> 02:23:28,850
is it based on trial and error?
Is it based on hard science?

3197
02:23:28,851 --> 02:23:30,000
It's not my truck.
Well,

3198
02:23:30,001 --> 02:23:31,260
these are soft sciences,
right?

3199
02:23:31,261 --> 02:23:34,080
Psychology is a soft science.
You can't measure it in that sense.

3200
02:23:34,081 --> 02:23:36,570
But in this woman's case,
three days later,

3201
02:23:36,571 --> 02:23:38,480
she changed her whole life.
She say she,

3202
02:23:38,481 --> 02:23:42,210
she's now creating little,
little she'd put water at for them.

3203
02:23:42,870 --> 02:23:47,870
It changed her whole life.
And you know who her husband wants to 

3204
02:23:47,870 --> 02:23:47,870
kill me.
Oh my God.

3205
02:23:47,870 --> 02:23:49,320
This his wife was no longer this meek,
fearful woman named more.

3206
02:23:49,321 --> 02:23:50,980
She got her voice back her.

3207
02:23:51,290 --> 02:23:53,110
So the husband was a mad at you.
Curve.

3208
02:23:53,130 --> 02:23:56,070
Husband was furious with me because his 
wife was gone.

3209
02:23:56,650 --> 02:23:57,390
So you,
you,

3210
02:23:57,690 --> 02:24:00,600
you break this one pattern.
One area effected everything else in her

3211
02:24:00,601 --> 02:24:05,601
life.
Her mother in law came to see me and 

3212
02:24:05,601 --> 02:24:05,601
said,
don't do that Voodoo on me.

3213
02:24:05,601 --> 02:24:09,051
I lost like five patients in a bunch of 
money over this because you make a 

3214
02:24:09,051 --> 02:24:13,071
change in someone's life in this sense 
that it changes the whole direction of 

3215
02:24:13,071 --> 02:24:14,070
other,
other parts of their lives.

3216
02:24:14,071 --> 02:24:19,071
And it all comes from these whatever 
type of pattern that we're running in 

3217
02:24:19,071 --> 02:24:19,071
our head here.
So me,

3218
02:24:19,071 --> 02:24:23,571
I go back to wrestling.
My pattern was I can hang with these 

3219
02:24:23,571 --> 02:24:26,151
guys and I achieve that.
You work with a sports psychologist if 

3220
02:24:26,151 --> 02:24:26,151
you.
If you get a mental break,

3221
02:24:26,151 --> 02:24:30,621
I'd imagine Anderson will probably talk 
to someone for breaking his leg like 

3222
02:24:30,621 --> 02:24:30,621
that.

3223
02:24:30,621 --> 02:24:31,230
I believe he is.
Yeah.

3224
02:24:31,240 --> 02:24:36,240
You have to learn how to process and 
deal with these things and for me it's 

3225
02:24:36,361 --> 02:24:38,880
so important not just in fighting,
fighting sick,

3226
02:24:38,890 --> 02:24:43,890
this extreme kind of way of living,
but something that everyone can benefit 

3227
02:24:43,890 --> 02:24:44,830
from.
Yeah.

3228
02:24:44,850 --> 02:24:49,850
That's tough science thing though is 
real tricky because a lot of the 

3229
02:24:49,850 --> 02:24:54,230
benefits of something or a lot of the 
success in doing something like that is 

3230
02:24:54,230 --> 02:24:55,710
based on the confidence that you have in
the therapy.

3231
02:24:56,070 --> 02:24:59,040
Like if you believe that you can change,
you believe it can help you at work,

3232
02:24:59,310 --> 02:25:01,950
but if you'll like this shit ain't going
to work.

3233
02:25:01,980 --> 02:25:02,730
Go ahead.
Try it.

3234
02:25:02,790 --> 02:25:05,400
See it didn't work.
You know that stuff doesn't work.

3235
02:25:05,470 --> 02:25:07,590
Yeah.
You can have that attitude.

3236
02:25:07,620 --> 02:25:12,620
St People could go into the same office 
and deal with the same counselor and 

3237
02:25:12,751 --> 02:25:17,751
have a similar issue and the depending 
upon their confidence in that type of 

3238
02:25:17,751 --> 02:25:22,041
therapy.
A lot of it is based on the belief in 

3239
02:25:22,041 --> 02:25:22,041
change.
Same thing with coaching,

3240
02:25:22,041 --> 02:25:22,490
right?
Yeah.

3241
02:25:22,500 --> 02:25:24,080
I could have two athletes.
You can

3242
02:25:24,400 --> 02:25:29,400
do the all the same stuff.
One will believe it and this has 

3243
02:25:29,400 --> 02:25:29,400
happened.
One doesn't.

3244
02:25:29,400 --> 02:25:33,000
One will succeed,
the other won't have to go somewhere 

3245
02:25:33,000 --> 02:25:33,000
else,
but I think you can change this.

3246
02:25:33,000 --> 02:25:36,991
I went to this for years.
He sends his mother a skydiving 

3247
02:25:36,991 --> 02:25:38,050
instructor and I always see,
come on,

3248
02:25:38,051 --> 02:25:41,440
let's go skydiving.
And I made up some bullshit excuse about

3249
02:25:41,441 --> 02:25:46,441
how I didn't want to go skydiving,
but in the back of my head it kind of 

3250
02:25:46,441 --> 02:25:46,780
bothered me.
So I had this skydiving fear linked up.

3251
02:25:46,781 --> 02:25:49,870
So as soon as I kind of learn how to 
take control and direct my own mind,

3252
02:25:49,871 --> 02:25:54,871
I decided I'm going to go skydiving.
This is in Australia and I go down 

3253
02:25:54,871 --> 02:25:55,570
there.
I said,

3254
02:25:55,571 --> 02:25:56,140
okay,
I want to do.

3255
02:25:56,141 --> 02:25:58,030
It's a tandem jump.
He's attached to my back.

3256
02:25:59,170 --> 02:26:00,070
We'd go up in the.
I watched him,

3257
02:26:00,071 --> 02:26:01,150
I watched them pack the shoot.

3258
02:26:01,150 --> 02:26:04,810
We go up in the airplane.
It's over the Sunday island,

3259
02:26:04,811 --> 02:26:06,790
73 tropical islands.
It's beautiful.

3260
02:26:06,791 --> 02:26:10,430
I hire a camera man.
I don't have an ounce of fear whatsoever

3261
02:26:10,431 --> 02:26:11,710
in my body.
Right?

3262
02:26:12,030 --> 02:26:17,030
At the time I couldn't have felt better 
and my job really is just when he taps 

3263
02:26:17,030 --> 02:26:21,091
me,
my job is to arch back because he has 

3264
02:26:21,091 --> 02:26:21,091
the shoot,
so he tapped me.

3265
02:26:21,091 --> 02:26:25,360
I archbeck we pull the shooting.
At that moment I knew something was 

3266
02:26:25,360 --> 02:26:25,360
wrong.
God,

3267
02:26:25,360 --> 02:26:30,270
I don't know how I knew something was 
wrong and then I'm looking down and he 

3268
02:26:30,270 --> 02:26:34,831
yells in my ear for words I'll never 
forget we're having a malfunction.

3269
02:26:36,170 --> 02:26:41,170
And at that point everything stopped.
And I remember looking down in the 

3270
02:26:41,170 --> 02:26:41,410
first,
this is what came to my head.

3271
02:26:41,440 --> 02:26:46,440
No motion as calm as can be.
This is the first time in my life I've 

3272
02:26:46,440 --> 02:26:47,890
ever been completely committed to 
something.

3273
02:26:48,280 --> 02:26:51,670
That's the thought I had.
So I look,

3274
02:26:51,700 --> 02:26:54,190
you know,
chute opens up again.

3275
02:26:54,191 --> 02:26:57,010
We dropped like a sack of potatoes.
I didn't realize that,

3276
02:26:57,310 --> 02:27:02,310
you know,
cause the shoot had folded over on 

3277
02:27:02,310 --> 02:27:04,531
itself.
So it had slowed us down some but not 

3278
02:27:04,531 --> 02:27:06,991
nearly.
Now we're going to die if we tried to 

3279
02:27:06,991 --> 02:27:06,991
land with that shoot.
So he cuts it.

3280
02:27:06,991 --> 02:27:08,980
When you drop really fast again,
then he opens the reserve chute.

3281
02:27:09,910 --> 02:27:11,560
So at this point it doesn't say anything
to me,

3282
02:27:11,561 --> 02:27:12,370
and I asked him,
I go,

3283
02:27:12,371 --> 02:27:14,350
hey,
now he's on my back,

3284
02:27:14,370 --> 02:27:16,510
right?
Are we going to be okay?

3285
02:27:16,860 --> 02:27:18,490
And he goes,
yeah,

3286
02:27:18,491 --> 02:27:19,870
yeah,
yeah,

3287
02:27:19,871 --> 02:27:20,200
we're,
we're,

3288
02:27:20,201 --> 02:27:21,310
we're,
we're going to be okay.

3289
02:27:22,420 --> 02:27:23,230
I said,
man,

3290
02:27:23,590 --> 02:27:25,690
I need more certainty in your voice 
right now,

3291
02:27:25,970 --> 02:27:27,440
but he goes,
we're going to be alright.

3292
02:27:27,550 --> 02:27:28,870
I go,
you tell me that again.

3293
02:27:28,871 --> 02:27:29,690
He goes,
we're going to be our,

3294
02:27:29,720 --> 02:27:31,130
so we're going to be all right.

3295
02:27:31,240 --> 02:27:32,980
Tell me one more time.
And then we landed and it was,

3296
02:27:33,030 --> 02:27:38,030
it's on youtube somewhere.
I actually posted a young Ryan jumping 

3297
02:27:38,030 --> 02:27:38,760
out of a plane,
but it didn't make me nervous.

3298
02:27:38,761 --> 02:27:40,660
Just sitting here listening to this.
But again,

3299
02:27:40,661 --> 02:27:43,660
I think when you talk about emotional 
management,

3300
02:27:43,840 --> 02:27:47,380
I think that this is a skill that you 
can learn,

3301
02:27:47,700 --> 02:27:52,700
that you can under very,
very stressful and high pressure 

3302
02:27:52,700 --> 02:27:55,540
situations that is a learned skill that 
you can deal with and being able to work

3303
02:27:55,541 --> 02:28:00,541
on that stuff personally,
to help other people through it and to 

3304
02:28:00,541 --> 02:28:02,500
have experiences like that.
You find yourself in other circumstances

3305
02:28:02,501 --> 02:28:04,960
where all of a sudden you're under 
stress and you can perform,

3306
02:28:04,990 --> 02:28:08,230
and that's what the masters do when when
all the pressure's on,

3307
02:28:08,920 --> 02:28:13,920
everything's on the line right now,
are you going to step up and perform or 

3308
02:28:13,920 --> 02:28:16,681
not,
and I think that to ignore that 

3309
02:28:16,681 --> 02:28:19,411
component for an MMA fighter who's 
getting in their underwear and fighting 

3310
02:28:19,411 --> 02:28:22,951
for their lunch money,
that you absolutely need to spend time 

3311
02:28:22,951 --> 02:28:22,951
and

3312
02:28:22,951 --> 02:28:26,980
effort developing that side of yourself 
and you should have people surrounding 

3313
02:28:26,980 --> 02:28:28,670
you who can help you develop that 
confidence because it does not happen in

3314
02:28:28,671 --> 02:28:33,671
a vacuum.
It's different for every person because 

3315
02:28:34,431 --> 02:28:36,380
every person's going to have different 
issues,

3316
02:28:36,381 --> 02:28:39,950
different things that they fear 
different obstacles to overcome.

3317
02:28:39,951 --> 02:28:43,520
For some fighters it might have been 
getting subbed for other fighters.

3318
02:28:43,521 --> 02:28:48,521
It might have been being code before,
and that fear of committing and getting 

3319
02:28:48,521 --> 02:28:49,060
caught.
You have k,

3320
02:28:49,061 --> 02:28:52,260
you have to have my kids have.
Each one is different,

3321
02:28:52,890 --> 02:28:56,310
very different.
So your.

3322
02:28:56,320 --> 02:28:59,120
You're challenging the father is to find
out ways that you can get.

3323
02:28:59,121 --> 02:29:00,410
It's all about leadership,
right?

3324
02:29:00,770 --> 02:29:03,680
Yeah,
and for me leadership is about influence

3325
02:29:04,230 --> 02:29:09,230
and it's about service,
so if you find out what these people 

3326
02:29:09,230 --> 02:29:11,300
really need and then you can help 
influence them in that direction,

3327
02:29:11,750 --> 02:29:15,830
then people are going to rise to the 
levels that they never dreamed of and to

3328
02:29:15,831 --> 02:29:19,430
me that if you're in a position of 
leadership that has to be your focus.

3329
02:29:19,430 --> 02:29:21,560
That's where it's really difficult to be
a manager.

3330
02:29:21,561 --> 02:29:25,440
It's gotta be difficult to a.
especially because you're.

3331
02:29:25,510 --> 02:29:27,170
You're,
you're professional.

3332
02:29:27,470 --> 02:29:32,470
Yeah.
Your profession relies on other people 

3333
02:29:32,470 --> 02:29:33,260
putting all these pieces together.
You helping them,

3334
02:29:33,500 --> 02:29:36,050
but God it all.
Ultimately,

3335
02:29:36,051 --> 02:29:38,750
once that cage door shuts,
you can't do a goddamn thing.

3336
02:29:39,050 --> 02:29:42,320
You have to sit there and watch the work
and hope that it all took.

3337
02:29:42,950 --> 02:29:44,480
That's jeff and Shandor's life,
right?

3338
02:29:44,660 --> 02:29:45,540
Sort of.
Yeah,

3339
02:29:45,541 --> 02:29:46,060
yeah,
yeah,

3340
02:29:46,061 --> 02:29:47,680
yeah.
They do something.

3341
02:29:47,890 --> 02:29:49,790
What'd you do?
A comedy special on that too long ago,

3342
02:29:50,360 --> 02:29:52,100
so they have to sit there and go,
shit,

3343
02:29:52,101 --> 02:29:55,070
I hope all this is going to work out.
Joe's on stage,

3344
02:29:55,071 --> 02:29:57,350
so I'm confident in them,
but that's the job.

3345
02:29:57,410 --> 02:29:58,970
Yeah,
it's tricky.

3346
02:29:58,971 --> 02:30:01,550
It's a tricky gehrig.
I'm too much of a control freak.

3347
02:30:01,551 --> 02:30:06,551
I don't think I'd be real good at that.
Well that the mindset that you have is 

3348
02:30:06,551 --> 02:30:10,571
someone on the talent side of the 
equation is totally different than 

3349
02:30:10,571 --> 02:30:14,051
someone on the management side,
so hopefully you understand where they 

3350
02:30:14,051 --> 02:30:18,491
come from,
the challenge that happened in their 

3351
02:30:18,491 --> 02:30:18,491
life.

3352
02:30:18,491 --> 02:30:19,340
You try to be better at that and they 
have empathy and understand the pressure

3353
02:30:19,341 --> 02:30:24,341
that comes from being talent and being 
the one out there with the spotlight on 

3354
02:30:24,341 --> 02:30:24,860
them and they.
They adjust their approach for that.

3355
02:30:25,590 --> 02:30:28,130
Yeah,
it's a when it all comes together,

3356
02:30:28,200 --> 02:30:30,230
I mean it's magical.
It's magical,

3357
02:30:30,920 --> 02:30:32,810
you know,
but it's so hard.

3358
02:30:33,120 --> 02:30:37,970
It's unbelievably hard to find the right
manager,

3359
02:30:38,000 --> 02:30:41,060
the right athlete,
the right training environment,

3360
02:30:41,360 --> 02:30:45,530
the right training partners,
the right scenario in life.

3361
02:30:45,680 --> 02:30:47,480
And then the other stuff that we talked 
about,

3362
02:30:47,510 --> 02:30:49,310
the right girlfriend,
the right wife,

3363
02:30:49,340 --> 02:30:50,510
right boyfriend,
the right,

3364
02:30:50,511 --> 02:30:51,680
whatever the fuck it is.
The,

3365
02:30:51,890 --> 02:30:56,890
the,
the support system that you have at 

3366
02:30:56,890 --> 02:30:56,890
home.
You mean how many fighters have you seen

3367
02:30:56,890 --> 02:31:00,851
go off the rails because their 
girlfriend breaks up with them or their 

3368
02:31:00,851 --> 02:31:04,871
girlfriend will fucking demand attention
right before a fight and cause fucking 

3369
02:31:05,690 --> 02:31:09,260
girlfriend and a fighter.
I managed steal his fight shorts,

3370
02:31:09,261 --> 02:31:11,450
mouthpiece and cup two days before the 
fight.

3371
02:31:11,820 --> 02:31:15,440
Refuse to give them back for two days 
because she wanted attention.

3372
02:31:15,550 --> 02:31:16,500
Yeah.
Yeah.

3373
02:31:17,050 --> 02:31:19,100
But who gets to deal with that?
You.

3374
02:31:19,280 --> 02:31:20,130
Yeah.
So what'd you do?

3375
02:31:20,680 --> 02:31:25,680
The longer story.
Long story would have to check me for a 

3376
02:31:25,680 --> 02:31:28,560
microphone.
All these crazy things start to happen.

3377
02:31:28,561 --> 02:31:28,920
Yeah,

3378
02:31:29,050 --> 02:31:31,360
of course he has the pressure pressure 
shows,

3379
02:31:31,361 --> 02:31:32,860
cracks.
You know,

3380
02:31:32,861 --> 02:31:37,861
everything is nice and easy.
As long as the water pressure's really 

3381
02:31:37,861 --> 02:31:39,370
relaxed and simple and nice to trick a 
little creek,

3382
02:31:39,430 --> 02:31:43,210
but when it's all fucking river,
that leads up to Niagara Falls.

3383
02:31:43,570 --> 02:31:44,640
Boy,
does that expose

3384
02:31:44,680 --> 02:31:45,850
the cracks?
I've seen that.

3385
02:31:46,210 --> 02:31:51,210
I've had people in corners.
I've been fortunate to be involved this 

3386
02:31:51,210 --> 02:31:51,760
the stages of athlete development from 
the beginning.

3387
02:31:51,761 --> 02:31:53,020
You just got here too.
Oh,

3388
02:31:53,021 --> 02:31:55,060
you're a world champion.
Very different.

3389
02:31:55,061 --> 02:31:58,660
And you have to know if you're on the 
management side of things and training,

3390
02:31:58,661 --> 02:32:03,661
you have to know how each of those 
stages are different because you can 

3391
02:32:03,661 --> 02:32:04,990
spin off the rails at any moment.
But I've seen people crack on the corner

3392
02:32:04,991 --> 02:32:09,310
before it took.
It took me five or six years of being in

3393
02:32:09,311 --> 02:32:11,740
corners before I was really like right 
now.

3394
02:32:11,741 --> 02:32:13,930
And I sit in the corner.
I'm not at all emotional.

3395
02:32:14,230 --> 02:32:16,170
I see things super clear.
I see.

3396
02:32:16,540 --> 02:32:19,240
But that took years to develop your 
would imagine.

3397
02:32:19,460 --> 02:32:23,140
Imagine being unbelievably difficult 
thing to wrap your head around.

3398
02:32:23,590 --> 02:32:25,660
I'm sure it's similar to you calling 
fights,

3399
02:32:25,661 --> 02:32:27,090
right?
The first couple,

3400
02:32:27,130 --> 02:32:28,540
maybe a year or two.
You do it.

3401
02:32:28,541 --> 02:32:28,930
It's.

3402
02:32:29,720 --> 02:32:31,460
Yeah.
I was worried about everything that came

3403
02:32:31,461 --> 02:32:35,900
out of my mouth and the fuck I was 
saying like talking too much.

3404
02:32:35,930 --> 02:32:38,570
Am I talking too little?
Am I being an idiot?

3405
02:32:38,690 --> 02:32:39,860
You know,
this is a lot,

3406
02:32:40,360 --> 02:32:43,900
but if you're the guy in the mic putting
yourself out there,

3407
02:32:43,901 --> 02:32:46,800
there's gonna be a whole bunch of people
hate everything that you say.

3408
02:32:46,801 --> 02:32:48,860
And there'll be some that like it.
And yeah,

3409
02:32:48,910 --> 02:32:52,040
that's also.
But I a lot of

3410
02:32:52,040 --> 02:32:54,740
different things like that,
so I'm used to that,

3411
02:32:54,950 --> 02:32:59,950
like most of my life involves doing 
things live that other people are going 

3412
02:33:00,161 --> 02:33:00,950
to hear.
Yeah.

3413
02:33:01,070 --> 02:33:06,070
Like stand up podcasting and you know,
doing the UFC commentary are all live 

3414
02:33:07,041 --> 02:33:09,140
things that other people are going to 
hear.

3415
02:33:09,470 --> 02:33:11,390
Yeah.
So you get used to that.

3416
02:33:11,391 --> 02:33:14,870
And so you got to be super honest about 
yourself.

3417
02:33:14,960 --> 02:33:18,200
You gotta be super honest about how you 
would listen to yourself.

3418
02:33:18,201 --> 02:33:23,201
Like I would find me annoying sometimes.
I have to know when I would find me 

3419
02:33:23,201 --> 02:33:24,770
annoying.
Some people don't want to do that.

3420
02:33:24,890 --> 02:33:28,520
Like I have friends that are comics that
won't listen to the recordings or God.

3421
02:33:28,521 --> 02:33:29,300
Hey listening.
I go,

3422
02:33:29,301 --> 02:33:30,920
listen,
I don't like listening to me either.

3423
02:33:30,921 --> 02:33:33,110
I fucking hate everything I do.
Let me tell you this right now.

3424
02:33:33,320 --> 02:33:35,810
Everything I fucking do,
I mean they'll be like,

3425
02:33:36,050 --> 02:33:37,790
I sat down with my friend already the 
other day,

3426
02:33:37,791 --> 02:33:38,480
our issue fear.

3427
02:33:39,200 --> 02:33:44,200
He does his podcast called skeptic tank.
And one of the things that he's been 

3428
02:33:44,200 --> 02:33:44,680
doing lately is going over,
um,

3429
02:33:44,720 --> 02:33:48,110
comedy records like that you did in the 
past.

3430
02:33:48,111 --> 02:33:53,111
Like the play it for you and like what 
was this bit based on what we think and 

3431
02:33:53,111 --> 02:33:57,701
here,
what do you think when you hear this 

3432
02:33:57,701 --> 02:33:57,701
bit?
And like,

3433
02:33:57,701 --> 02:34:00,120
uh,
we did like one of my favorite all time 

3434
02:34:00,120 --> 02:34:00,710
cds was shiny,
happy Jihad and every,

3435
02:34:00,740 --> 02:34:02,660
you know,
second or third bit.

3436
02:34:02,661 --> 02:34:04,280
I really said like,
that's a good,

3437
02:34:04,310 --> 02:34:05,600
I love that bit.
That's a great band.

3438
02:34:05,780 --> 02:34:06,920
But the other ones were like,
oh,

3439
02:34:06,921 --> 02:34:09,560
this fucking back or cut that out and 
shorten this,

3440
02:34:09,590 --> 02:34:12,920
Trim that and add it to this or I don't 
like how I said that.

3441
02:34:12,921 --> 02:34:14,480
Or just like,
the cit tries,

3442
02:34:14,481 --> 02:34:17,350
you're fucking crazy,
but if it doesn't drive you crazy,

3443
02:34:17,800 --> 02:34:18,100
you're

3444
02:34:18,100 --> 02:34:20,910
not paying attention.
Well that's sort of sports psychologists

3445
02:34:20,920 --> 02:34:25,920
will to too.
They'll sit down and they'll watch you 

3446
02:34:25,920 --> 02:34:25,920
go.
What were you thinking here?

3447
02:34:25,920 --> 02:34:28,240
When Ryan came up to you in the cage and
he said this to you,

3448
02:34:28,241 --> 02:34:30,310
what were you thinking there?
And they've told me to Ryan,

3449
02:34:30,311 --> 02:34:31,750
we in the cage,
I saw you do this.

3450
02:34:31,751 --> 02:34:34,960
They'll say those things to me,
but the athletes have to go through.

3451
02:34:34,961 --> 02:34:36,190
Well,
when you went out there,

3452
02:34:36,191 --> 02:34:41,191
where was your focus when you're doing?
We'd use this by called an air assault 

3453
02:34:41,191 --> 02:34:41,191
bike.
That's like a.

3454
02:34:41,191 --> 02:34:43,270
it's like a Schwinn airdyne bike on 
steroids and things.

3455
02:34:43,271 --> 02:34:44,000
Amazing.
What's it called?

3456
02:34:44,260 --> 02:34:47,140
It's called an era assault air bike or 
air assault bike.

3457
02:34:48,380 --> 02:34:51,000
It's,
it's the same principle of a,

3458
02:34:51,001 --> 02:34:54,040
a Schwinn airdyne bike,
but it's built like a tank.

3459
02:34:54,041 --> 02:34:56,050
I mean,
it's amazing and it's,

3460
02:34:56,100 --> 02:34:57,790
it's the worst horror.

3461
02:34:57,820 --> 02:35:00,820
It's just terrible to be on that thing.
But salt air bike.

3462
02:35:00,880 --> 02:35:05,880
So yeah.
So we use Arrow Dong because I get on 

3463
02:35:05,880 --> 02:35:06,940
that different.
It's just,

3464
02:35:06,941 --> 02:35:08,950
it's an Airdyne bike,
but the way it's geared,

3465
02:35:08,951 --> 02:35:13,951
it's that thing is horrible and this is 
what we use for our conditioning now 

3466
02:35:13,951 --> 02:35:17,551
because there's no stress in your body.
And Dennis actually has been using the 

3467
02:35:17,551 --> 02:35:20,651
hypoxic,
who's got a mask on his face simulating 

3468
02:35:20,651 --> 02:35:23,221
9,000
feet and he gets on and spring thing 

3469
02:35:23,221 --> 02:35:25,520
three five minute rounds.
So these are these better than like 

3470
02:35:25,520 --> 02:35:26,920
elliptical machines.
It's a whole different animal.

3471
02:35:26,950 --> 02:35:27,780
Really?
Yeah.

3472
02:35:27,790 --> 02:35:32,790
If I could put you in 20 seconds,
you can be wishing that your about me.

3473
02:35:34,150 --> 02:35:36,630
Let's do it in about 10 seconds,
10 seconds.

3474
02:35:37,390 --> 02:35:38,610
It's amazing.
Yeah.

3475
02:35:38,680 --> 02:35:40,210
So anyways,
um,

3476
02:35:40,750 --> 02:35:42,330
we put people on this,
you know,

3477
02:35:42,340 --> 02:35:43,630
Dan,
I'm Caitlyn,

3478
02:35:43,631 --> 02:35:48,631
does this dentists use it,
pat uses it and then it becomes a mind 

3479
02:35:48,631 --> 02:35:49,090
because you're doing the work that 
doesn't move.

3480
02:35:49,090 --> 02:35:54,090
You have to move it and there's a gauge.
We record all your numbers for every 

3481
02:35:54,090 --> 02:35:57,481
sprint.
So we know at the beginning of camp 

3482
02:35:57,481 --> 02:35:57,481
where there's numbers look like to the 
end of the camp.

3483
02:35:57,481 --> 02:36:01,920
So what do you do when you have them do 
like 30 seconds to do style sprints.

3484
02:36:02,170 --> 02:36:07,170
So what is to explain the Tabata 
protocol for people who don't know what 

3485
02:36:07,170 --> 02:36:10,611
it is,
20 seconds of work followed by 10 

3486
02:36:10,611 --> 02:36:12,901
seconds of rest and we start out there.
Traditionally we're four minutes and so 

3487
02:36:12,901 --> 02:36:14,830
we start at the beginning of the camp,
maybe once a week,

3488
02:36:14,831 --> 02:36:19,831
one round to four minutes and we up it 
to two rounds and we go to five minutes 

3489
02:36:19,831 --> 02:36:23,011
to simulate the rounds in a fight.
But we have all the data and I'm big on 

3490
02:36:23,011 --> 02:36:27,421
data and numbers.
I want to see are we doing what's 

3491
02:36:27,421 --> 02:36:27,421
working right?

3492
02:36:27,421 --> 02:36:29,230
Working heart rate preimposed I,
there's one thing we don't do,

3493
02:36:29,231 --> 02:36:31,240
that's probably the next thing,
but right now we don't,

3494
02:36:31,241 --> 02:36:34,780
we measure the watts on the bike so I 
know their output as they're going.

3495
02:36:35,380 --> 02:36:40,380
Um,
so as far as the sports psychology side 

3496
02:36:40,380 --> 02:36:44,521
of things that are.
But if that aerosol bike is so horrible 

3497
02:36:44,521 --> 02:36:45,190
that you want to quit,
I mean it just feels terrible.

3498
02:36:45,191 --> 02:36:50,191
So it's one other way that we constantly
find ways to help help these guys keep 

3499
02:36:50,191 --> 02:36:52,540
focus and push through and their bodies 
opinion about hard to do that.

3500
02:36:52,541 --> 02:36:56,500
That thing is horrible.
Called called it Satan's tryst.

3501
02:36:58,140 --> 02:37:00,010
Well this looks like a regular airdyne 
bike,

3502
02:37:00,011 --> 02:37:03,430
but it looks pretty goddamn sturdy for 
something you can't Pat Pat.

3503
02:37:03,440 --> 02:37:04,030
Well,
Rebecca,

3504
02:37:04,110 --> 02:37:09,110
a Schwinn airdyne bike.
They're not strong enough to powerful 

3505
02:37:09,110 --> 02:37:10,120
that.
That bike right there.

3506
02:37:10,270 --> 02:37:11,740
You'll beat the fuck out of it.
Oh yeah.

3507
02:37:11,850 --> 02:37:13,510
A cholesterol fitness.
I one.

3508
02:37:13,570 --> 02:37:15,770
Those are the same guys.
It's sold me that reverse hyper.

3509
02:37:15,950 --> 02:37:16,210
I

3510
02:37:16,210 --> 02:37:17,660
might have to pick one of these fuckers 
up.

3511
02:37:17,690 --> 02:37:19,010
It's horrible.
I'm scared,

3512
02:37:19,011 --> 02:37:20,840
but I might have to get it.
What about rowing?

3513
02:37:21,380 --> 02:37:23,510
I think the main thing with cardio and 
I,

3514
02:37:23,511 --> 02:37:27,320
this is something new I just learned 
from Andy Galpin who's a phd,

3515
02:37:27,321 --> 02:37:32,321
he's the,
he's the guy who did the study on the 

3516
02:37:32,321 --> 02:37:34,001
radius reps and he came back from a 
conference to the latest data with 

3517
02:37:34,001 --> 02:37:36,410
cardio stuff and heart health is if 
you're doing,

3518
02:37:36,411 --> 02:37:41,411
you know,
go for a walk or you do your little 

3519
02:37:41,411 --> 02:37:41,411
easy,
30 minutes of Cardio,

3520
02:37:41,411 --> 02:37:42,320
you're not getting a cardiovascular 
benefit from that.

3521
02:37:42,680 --> 02:37:47,680
You have to get so you're that your 
heart rate is getting up so hard and so 

3522
02:37:47,680 --> 02:37:52,631
high that you're better off doing these 
high intensity sprint type workouts for 

3523
02:37:52,631 --> 02:37:53,790
overall heart health.
Yeah.

3524
02:37:54,400 --> 02:37:56,570
When you start talking crazy cardio or 
start going,

3525
02:37:57,770 --> 02:37:59,240
yeah,
I'm going to preparing,

3526
02:37:59,660 --> 02:38:01,070
preparing,
like that type of stuff.

3527
02:38:01,580 --> 02:38:06,580
I like pushing myself.
I'm a big fan in getting to this hiccup 

3528
02:38:06,580 --> 02:38:08,390
on.
I know there's one right there,

3529
02:38:08,750 --> 02:38:13,750
so this dude is doing sprints on it.
That probably doesn't do it justice 

3530
02:38:15,220 --> 02:38:17,110
because he's opposed to say it.
No,

3531
02:38:17,120 --> 02:38:18,410
no,
it doesn't do us justice.

3532
02:38:18,411 --> 02:38:20,180
Why that thing is,
that bike is horrible.

3533
02:38:20,210 --> 02:38:22,550
It breaks everybody.
You can't beat it.

3534
02:38:22,940 --> 02:38:23,780
Yeah.
No,

3535
02:38:23,781 --> 02:38:25,660
it's impossible.
So you have this opportunity.

3536
02:38:25,680 --> 02:38:28,270
This is the best machine for cardio flow
for shore.

3537
02:38:28,340 --> 02:38:29,670
Really?
Yeah,

3538
02:38:29,680 --> 02:38:31,430
because because there's no stress in 
your body.

3539
02:38:31,431 --> 02:38:32,500
You're getting upper,
mid.

3540
02:38:32,510 --> 02:38:37,510
I'm pushing them out of the political 
machines are key code and elliptical 

3541
02:38:37,880 --> 02:38:41,420
pretty hard.
I bet you if you sprinted as hard as you

3542
02:38:41,421 --> 02:38:46,421
could on elliptical for 30 seconds or as
hard as you could on that for 30 

3543
02:38:46,421 --> 02:38:46,421
seconds,
it wouldn't even be in the same boat.

3544
02:38:46,421 --> 02:38:46,790
Really?
Yeah.

3545
02:38:47,240 --> 02:38:51,050
I use a elliptical machine the way I 
would do it for the most part,

3546
02:38:51,230 --> 02:38:53,000
don't follow to the bottom,
but I probably should.

3547
02:38:53,300 --> 02:38:55,400
I would just do 30 hard,
30 hard,

3548
02:38:55,401 --> 02:38:59,710
30 off need to buy sometimes just if 
just to keep it fresh with a 30,

3549
02:38:59,720 --> 02:39:04,720
30,
[inaudible] heart as you can go for 

3550
02:39:04,720 --> 02:39:07,361
eight minutes.
There's all sorts of ways that you can 

3551
02:39:07,361 --> 02:39:09,191
do it,
but like I've had friends that like say 

3552
02:39:09,191 --> 02:39:09,191
like,
Oh,

3553
02:39:09,191 --> 02:39:10,340
I'm staying in a hotel.
Nobody fucking wait to hear.

3554
02:39:10,341 --> 02:39:11,940
I can't get a workout in.
I be like,

3555
02:39:12,020 --> 02:39:17,020
Oh,
you didn't get to work on it then come 

3556
02:39:17,020 --> 02:39:17,020
do this.
This is what I do.

3557
02:39:17,020 --> 02:39:17,020
Yeah.
I'll do it at a hotel room,

3558
02:39:17,230 --> 02:39:22,230
a hotel gym.
What's just have nothing but an 

3559
02:39:22,230 --> 02:39:22,230
elliptical machine.
I'll just crank that bitch.

3560
02:39:22,230 --> 02:39:22,340
What does it go up to?
17.

3561
02:39:22,700 --> 02:39:23,550
Okay.
This is what you do.

3562
02:39:23,551 --> 02:39:25,830
You do 10 minutes at five,
you know,

3563
02:39:25,840 --> 02:39:28,490
you start getting everything lubed up 
and then here we go.

3564
02:39:28,520 --> 02:39:30,220
Crank that fucker up to seven.
So you're,

3565
02:39:30,250 --> 02:39:31,930
you're huffing and puffing at the end.
Yeah.

3566
02:39:31,940 --> 02:39:32,710
Yeah,
that's it.

3567
02:39:32,711 --> 02:39:34,820
That's where all the benefit company 
always comes from.

3568
02:39:34,940 --> 02:39:36,590
So I could just steady jog.

3569
02:39:39,170 --> 02:39:40,170
Nothing.
Yeah.

3570
02:39:40,171 --> 02:39:43,520
You're not going to get like now doctor 
gallon is telling me that when people.

3571
02:39:43,521 --> 02:39:48,521
Now that protocols for after heart 
attacks is that you get that heart rate 

3572
02:39:48,521 --> 02:39:52,091
up as quick as possible.
You get it moving again after a heart 

3573
02:39:52,091 --> 02:39:52,091
attack.
Yeah.

3574
02:39:52,091 --> 02:39:53,480
Again,
that's just a quick,

3575
02:39:53,481 --> 02:39:55,820
quick conversation we had.
That's not an expertise of mine.

3576
02:39:55,821 --> 02:39:58,370
He'd probably be a better person to ask,
but um,

3577
02:39:58,940 --> 02:39:59,360
yeah,
it,

3578
02:39:59,361 --> 02:40:01,790
it changed.
You have guys who sprint a lot,

3579
02:40:01,791 --> 02:40:03,290
right?
And all of a sudden you start to develop

3580
02:40:03,291 --> 02:40:05,150
a knee problems,
hip problems for it.

3581
02:40:05,510 --> 02:40:10,510
Jump on that aerosol bike.
You're going to get all the cardio that 

3582
02:40:10,510 --> 02:40:10,510
you need.
Well,

3583
02:40:10,510 --> 02:40:11,210
pat does a lot of mountain biking too,
doesn't he?

3584
02:40:11,330 --> 02:40:12,110
He does,
yeah.

3585
02:40:12,620 --> 02:40:13,430
He's a.
that's a.

3586
02:40:13,440 --> 02:40:15,620
that's a fucking hard workout.
Good hills on.

3587
02:40:15,680 --> 02:40:17,580
On.
His favorite part is the climb.

3588
02:40:17,820 --> 02:40:19,050
Yeah.
He's just fucking psycho.

3589
02:40:19,130 --> 02:40:20,130
Yeah,
he loves.

3590
02:40:20,250 --> 02:40:21,570
You should see the numbers.
He puts it.

3591
02:40:21,571 --> 02:40:24,180
I sent the numbers to the Aerosol.
I hear the numbers.

3592
02:40:24,330 --> 02:40:24,860
Exactly.
God,

3593
02:40:24,910 --> 02:40:26,760
I can't believe anyone does numbers like
this.

3594
02:40:26,790 --> 02:40:31,790
Like what kind of numbers on what?
It wouldn't mean anything to you unless 

3595
02:40:31,790 --> 02:40:34,401
you got an untried it,
but he'll hit over [inaudible] watson a 

3596
02:40:34,401 --> 02:40:36,590
sprint with that thing and for me to get
up to 1000 as hard or 1200.

3597
02:40:36,610 --> 02:40:38,310
So it's a matter of how much effort is 
putting out.

3598
02:40:38,370 --> 02:40:42,150
It's all effort because it's air.
The air pumps the fan,

3599
02:40:42,320 --> 02:40:47,320
like the fan is pumping air in the air.
It's basically a fan kind of scoops on 

3600
02:40:48,211 --> 02:40:48,930
it,
so it's hard.

3601
02:40:48,931 --> 02:40:51,000
As you're gonna move that thing.
That's the work you're going to get.

3602
02:40:51,100 --> 02:40:56,100
The harder you push it,
the more resistance you get because the 

3603
02:40:56,100 --> 02:40:56,100
more air it's pushing.
Yeah,

3604
02:40:56,460 --> 02:40:57,330
it's terrible.

3605
02:41:00,210 --> 02:41:01,140
I love it.
Yeah.

3606
02:41:01,590 --> 02:41:03,780
I'm ordering one right now.
Add to cart,

3607
02:41:03,840 --> 02:41:05,070
click.
All right.

3608
02:41:05,220 --> 02:41:10,220
Um,
do you think that there's other things 

3609
02:41:10,220 --> 02:41:12,870
that could be developed that could maybe
be more effective for mma?

3610
02:41:13,420 --> 02:41:16,090
Like you liked it.
I remember.

3611
02:41:16,580 --> 02:41:20,300
I think when you see this trend within,
especially this,

3612
02:41:20,400 --> 02:41:25,400
this for me,
the strength and conditioning guys are 

3613
02:41:25,400 --> 02:41:27,661
the most dangerous people in and in a 
fighter's camp because they can hurt 

3614
02:41:27,661 --> 02:41:27,720
them.
They can hurt them.

3615
02:41:27,721 --> 02:41:30,260
They had these weird egos.
No one can do my work yet.

3616
02:41:30,261 --> 02:41:31,860
I broke this guy,
that type of thing.

3617
02:41:32,100 --> 02:41:37,100
The other problem that the fighters run 
into is they go to gym a for their box 

3618
02:41:37,291 --> 02:41:39,690
and they do their emma here.
They could hear for Jujitsu.

3619
02:41:39,691 --> 02:41:44,691
They go here for strength and 
conditioning and no one's talking to 

3620
02:41:44,691 --> 02:41:45,660
each other because overtrain is a funny 
thing.

3621
02:41:45,900 --> 02:41:48,690
You can't really see it sometimes until 
it's too late.

3622
02:41:49,350 --> 02:41:54,350
So I want to know now if,
if we had a hard day Monday and Tuesday 

3623
02:41:54,350 --> 02:41:57,720
and pat and Katelyn are scheduled to go 
work with Mel on Wednesday,

3624
02:41:57,721 --> 02:41:59,100
why let Michelle know,
hey,

3625
02:41:59,101 --> 02:42:00,840
they're pretty fresh this week.
Push him here.

3626
02:42:01,110 --> 02:42:06,110
Oh,
Kaylin was dropping your left hand work 

3627
02:42:06,110 --> 02:42:06,110
on this.
Oh,

3628
02:42:06,110 --> 02:42:06,110
pat's doing this.
Oh,

3629
02:42:06,110 --> 02:42:06,690
you can push this and they need an easy 
light day.

3630
02:42:06,691 --> 02:42:08,040
Mentally they're spent.
Right.

3631
02:42:08,370 --> 02:42:11,070
So Mel knows that with their strength 
and conditioning coach,

3632
02:42:11,550 --> 02:42:12,630
she knows,
okay,

3633
02:42:12,690 --> 02:42:15,720
I let her know we need to pull back or 
listen,

3634
02:42:15,721 --> 02:42:20,721
let's let's push right now.
So the strength and conditioning as 

3635
02:42:20,721 --> 02:42:21,360
they're dangerous and sometimes they set
up training scenarios,

3636
02:42:21,361 --> 02:42:24,690
trained to Mimic Emma.
In my opinion,

3637
02:42:24,691 --> 02:42:29,691
it's not the right way to go.
If in the strength room we're trying to 

3638
02:42:29,691 --> 02:42:29,691
get strong,
right,

3639
02:42:29,691 --> 02:42:30,930
or if doing speed work,
we're trying to get fast.

3640
02:42:31,310 --> 02:42:36,310
The pride,
probably the best way to do that is to 

3641
02:42:36,310 --> 02:42:36,360
squat,
do some cleans to get overall strength.

3642
02:42:36,360 --> 02:42:39,710
You don't have to put me in an Ma 
position to try to be strong there.

3643
02:42:39,820 --> 02:42:42,360
I already spent five workouts this week 
doing.

3644
02:42:42,380 --> 02:42:42,970
Amen.
Well,

3645
02:42:42,990 --> 02:42:44,830
you were telling me before we started 
this podcast,

3646
02:42:44,831 --> 02:42:48,090
so you started really incorporating a 
lot of Olympic Olympic lift.

3647
02:42:48,091 --> 02:42:48,930
Olympic lift.
Yeah.

3648
02:42:48,931 --> 02:42:50,940
And that it's actually helped your joint
pain.

3649
02:42:51,060 --> 02:42:54,090
Pat Pat now is shut both of us.
No shoulder pain,

3650
02:42:54,290 --> 02:42:56,010
knee pain,
no back pain.

3651
02:42:56,400 --> 02:43:00,240
We do a lot of clean squatting.
Feels amazing.

3652
02:43:00,300 --> 02:43:03,570
What do you think is why?
Why is that eliminating pain?

3653
02:43:03,571 --> 02:43:08,400
I think because I think it strengthens 
your overall body in a different way.

3654
02:43:08,610 --> 02:43:11,480
If you're doing more kind of single 
plant type exercise.

3655
02:43:11,550 --> 02:43:12,060
If I'm

3656
02:43:12,070 --> 02:43:14,380
doing a curl or subdue him a particular 
thing,

3657
02:43:14,620 --> 02:43:16,810
there's a lot of stress that happens on 
the joint there.

3658
02:43:16,960 --> 02:43:20,610
If you do something like a clean,
it's an explosive motion.

3659
02:43:20,630 --> 02:43:25,630
You're jumping,
you're using your whole body from 

3660
02:43:25,630 --> 02:43:25,630
shoulders,
you're pulling.

3661
02:43:25,630 --> 02:43:25,750
It's very low.
Oddly enough,

3662
02:43:25,751 --> 02:43:30,751
it's a very low stress type of movement 
that that enables you to get super 

3663
02:43:30,751 --> 02:43:34,050
strong without taxing your joints.
It's a weird movement where everything's

3664
02:43:34,060 --> 02:43:38,410
just super technical explosion,
but that's the whole thing.

3665
02:43:38,411 --> 02:43:41,080
If if I'm there to get stronger,
more explosive.

3666
02:43:41,110 --> 02:43:46,110
If you're running me through a five,
a 25 minute circuit where I'm just kind 

3667
02:43:46,110 --> 02:43:48,280
of crossfit style as hard and fast as I 
can go.

3668
02:43:48,640 --> 02:43:51,730
We already did that in the inspiring.
We already did that.

3669
02:43:52,000 --> 02:43:53,590
We've done that.
What do we again,

3670
02:43:53,591 --> 02:43:55,300
why are we doing what we're doing?
Well,

3671
02:43:55,301 --> 02:43:58,480
the why is we need to develop more 
explicit hip strength.

3672
02:43:58,690 --> 02:44:02,530
Caitlin had super strong hips but didn't
have any idea how to activate them.

3673
02:44:02,550 --> 02:44:06,340
In my situation I tried all these 
different things and what helped get her

3674
02:44:06,341 --> 02:44:10,540
there was a cleans.
What about hard sparring?

3675
02:44:10,570 --> 02:44:11,430
What do you,
what do you,

3676
02:44:11,440 --> 02:44:16,440
what are your thoughts on.
There's a lot of fighters that bang it 

3677
02:44:16,440 --> 02:44:19,891
out two,
three days a week and other people say 

3678
02:44:19,891 --> 02:44:19,891
once a week is plenty good.
Not only that,

3679
02:44:19,891 --> 02:44:22,300
you probably shouldn't spar up until 
like the last few weeks of camp.

3680
02:44:22,301 --> 02:44:25,690
I think less is better.
I think you first have to.

3681
02:44:25,750 --> 02:44:27,820
Like when pat first came out to train 
with us,

3682
02:44:28,060 --> 02:44:33,060
there's a guy at king's mma.
He used to train there who was 300 

3683
02:44:33,060 --> 02:44:35,941
pounds and for 200 minutes for me for 
two minutes was the toughest guy in the 

3684
02:44:35,941 --> 02:44:39,811
world.
He would do flying knees and head key 

3685
02:44:39,811 --> 02:44:39,811
was amazing.
For two minutes.

3686
02:44:39,811 --> 02:44:39,811
For two.

3687
02:44:39,811 --> 02:44:42,970
After that he's talking about pounds.
That's a lot of fucking gas.

3688
02:44:42,971 --> 02:44:44,410
You need to pump too.
Yeah,

3689
02:44:44,411 --> 02:44:49,411
so I put them in there with patony lands
at three punch combination and then he 

3690
02:44:49,411 --> 02:44:52,860
kicks him in the head and they all ended
up standing next to Rafael Cordeiro and 

3691
02:44:52,860 --> 02:44:54,790
Patrick sponsee turns and goes around.
There's a right hand down the middle,

3692
02:44:54,791 --> 02:44:57,010
double exit into the ground,
and Raphael turns to me.

3693
02:44:57,011 --> 02:44:58,990
He goes,
I put my stamp on them.

3694
02:44:59,250 --> 02:45:01,780
Right?
Because if you're going to do this,

3695
02:45:01,781 --> 02:45:02,650
if you.
If you say,

3696
02:45:02,651 --> 02:45:07,651
I really want to be a cage fighter,
we got to figure out what's going to 

3697
02:45:07,651 --> 02:45:07,870
happen when someone hits you really 
hard.

3698
02:45:08,310 --> 02:45:13,310
Have you hit me really hard,
I'm probably going to go hide since I 

3699
02:45:13,310 --> 02:45:14,000
got somewhere to be and it's not here,
right?

3700
02:45:14,350 --> 02:45:19,350
So you have to figure that out.
Once you know that a guy or a girl has 

3701
02:45:19,350 --> 02:45:22,531
those natural fighter tendencies,
you don't have to keep finding that out 

3702
02:45:22,531 --> 02:45:22,531
three times a week.

3703
02:45:22,780 --> 02:45:24,820
If you're going to go fight for 15 
minutes,

3704
02:45:25,150 --> 02:45:28,630
then we're going to do once a week.
We'll spar for 15 minutes,

3705
02:45:28,631 --> 02:45:29,440
three,
five minute rounds.

3706
02:45:29,441 --> 02:45:32,620
I got that shield train was Saint Pierre
not too long ago in st peers at the same

3707
02:45:32,621 --> 02:45:34,900
thing.
If I'm fighting for five rounds,

3708
02:45:34,901 --> 02:45:39,901
I'll spar for five rounds.
Why take that guy I told you about 

3709
02:45:39,901 --> 02:45:41,080
before?
He would do these 10 round battles.

3710
02:45:41,081 --> 02:45:43,360
He did that for years and all of a 
sudden,

3711
02:45:43,361 --> 02:45:48,361
well,
fighter a has 200 rounds and you have 

3712
02:45:48,361 --> 02:45:51,190
2000 rounds on you.
You only have a limited amount that your

3713
02:45:51,191 --> 02:45:53,950
body's gonna withstand before things 
start going wrong.

3714
02:45:53,980 --> 02:45:57,000
What about light sparring?
Technical sparring.

3715
02:45:57,160 --> 02:45:59,230
I think it's good as long as it's not 
slow.

3716
02:45:59,231 --> 02:46:04,231
The problem,
a tactical sparring is that they play 

3717
02:46:04,231 --> 02:46:07,590
this lowe's lazy slow game.
I think having control is really 

3718
02:46:07,590 --> 02:46:07,930
important.
We're switching up.

3719
02:46:08,050 --> 02:46:10,490
We're doing two more studies now.
Kind of back to these gloves.

3720
02:46:10,550 --> 02:46:14,060
Figuring out if I'm sparring,
if I'm fighting in an MMA fight,

3721
02:46:14,061 --> 02:46:19,061
I have little gloves on.
If I do all my sparring and 16 ounce 

3722
02:46:19,061 --> 02:46:21,731
gloves visually,
I'm standing behind 32 ounce of 

3723
02:46:21,731 --> 02:46:22,190
material.
It looks and feels different.

3724
02:46:22,370 --> 02:46:27,370
It's much bigger,
much easier to protect yourself with 

3725
02:46:27,370 --> 02:46:28,810
those k one style guys that put.
They put the earmuffs on medium,

3726
02:46:28,820 --> 02:46:30,710
they put their gloves up next to their 
ear,

3727
02:46:30,890 --> 02:46:32,860
and that's the style of defense they 
use.

3728
02:46:32,861 --> 02:46:37,861
They go into this shell does not work in
an MMA because punches go around those 

3729
02:46:37,861 --> 02:46:39,260
gloves around them so your defense 
changes.

3730
02:46:39,890 --> 02:46:44,890
There's more I can throw a bad punch 
with a 16 ounce gloves on that I can't 

3731
02:46:44,890 --> 02:46:48,620
get away with in a four ounce gloves or 
bare knuckled or bare knuckle did.

3732
02:46:48,640 --> 02:46:53,640
The whole strategy is different,
so if you spend all your time hitting 

3733
02:46:53,640 --> 02:46:54,410
mitts with big gloves on sparring with 
big gloves on,

3734
02:46:54,411 --> 02:46:57,350
when you get into a cage,
something's going to going to be off.

3735
02:46:57,620 --> 02:47:00,290
Those things.
You could hit mits as hard as you can.

3736
02:47:00,350 --> 02:47:02,210
The hardest pair of Mitts with those 
things,

3737
02:47:02,390 --> 02:47:04,000
you're not going to have any hand pain 
with them.

3738
02:47:04,360 --> 02:47:06,380
What we're exploring next,
we're doing two studies.

3739
02:47:06,381 --> 02:47:11,381
Next first is what part does grip 
strength play in punching power and the 

3740
02:47:11,381 --> 02:47:16,211
next one is what's safer?
Are these gloves safer than 16 ounce 

3741
02:47:16,791 --> 02:47:18,350
gloves or a 16 ounce gloves?
Safer?

3742
02:47:18,351 --> 02:47:19,850
Because if you look at the amount of 
padding,

3743
02:47:20,300 --> 02:47:23,030
a 16 ounce gloves doesn't have any more 
padding this way.

3744
02:47:23,780 --> 02:47:26,750
We also have this bar,
this foam pad built in there,

3745
02:47:26,751 --> 02:47:29,060
so it spreads the area out over a wide 
area,

3746
02:47:29,100 --> 02:47:32,780
making it safer.
The wider the area that an impact Lens,

3747
02:47:32,781 --> 02:47:34,730
a safer it's gonna be for you.
So it does that.

3748
02:47:34,970 --> 02:47:38,360
A lot of a 16 ounce gloves in the thumb.
It's in the back portion of.

3749
02:47:38,370 --> 02:47:39,510
It's in the risks that we are.

3750
02:47:39,710 --> 02:47:42,730
It doesn't have any idea.
I went to Nova and yeah,

3751
02:47:42,731 --> 02:47:47,731
once and I was shocked to see them all 
sparring pretty hard with little gloves 

3752
02:47:47,731 --> 02:47:49,970
on and I look at how accurate joe say 
I'll do is with this punches.

3753
02:47:50,270 --> 02:47:55,270
To me,
this will be a game changer in how guys 

3754
02:47:55,270 --> 02:47:55,270
are training and preparing for Emma.
Emma,

3755
02:47:55,270 --> 02:47:59,201
I think you should be sparring and this.
I think you should be hitting mitts in 

3756
02:47:59,201 --> 02:48:01,661
them as much as you can do in a glove 
that's going to simulate your 

3757
02:48:01,661 --> 02:48:01,760
competition.
The better off you're going to be.

3758
02:48:01,770 --> 02:48:04,310
And I have a theory that we haven't 
tested yet.

3759
02:48:04,340 --> 02:48:07,100
These are actually safer than than 
boxing gloves.

3760
02:48:07,160 --> 02:48:08,640
Spar,
we're gonna.

3761
02:48:08,660 --> 02:48:11,000
Find out because there's less mass 
coming at you.

3762
02:48:11,800 --> 02:48:13,470
If you look at the quiz,
a physics equation,

3763
02:48:13,490 --> 02:48:18,490
the force of something equals the mass.
How big it is times acceleration or how 

3764
02:48:18,490 --> 02:48:18,490
fast it's moving.

3765
02:48:18,490 --> 02:48:23,260
This is smaller mass,
so if it's moving the same speed as the 

3766
02:48:23,260 --> 02:48:24,620
16 ounce glove,
the force will be less because it's less

3767
02:48:24,920 --> 02:48:27,710
mass coming at you.
The quick two questions arise,

3768
02:48:27,711 --> 02:48:29,510
one,
because it's smaller,

3769
02:48:29,570 --> 02:48:32,480
can you punch faster?
And the second is,

3770
02:48:32,630 --> 02:48:33,590
um,
pressure.

3771
02:48:33,890 --> 02:48:38,090
How much of the impact areas landing 
this bar spreads the pressure out over a

3772
02:48:38,091 --> 02:48:40,070
wider area.
It's going to make punching safer,

3773
02:48:40,700 --> 02:48:42,440
but again,
we're going to go test this in the lab.

3774
02:48:42,441 --> 02:48:43,700
We're going to find no one's ever done 
that.

3775
02:48:43,990 --> 02:48:48,990
Everyone is everyone who's ever started 
glove company called the same companies 

3776
02:48:48,990 --> 02:48:52,520
in Pakistan or China and they did a 
glove and they put a fancy logo on it 

3777
02:48:52,520 --> 02:48:52,520
and they said,
ah,

3778
02:48:52,520 --> 02:48:54,860
here we go.
This is the first time in the history of

3779
02:48:54,861 --> 02:48:57,440
combat sports.
Anyone's ever taken an idea and went,

3780
02:48:57,770 --> 02:48:58,790
hey,
I think this works.

3781
02:48:58,910 --> 02:49:03,910
Let's go.
To a real sport science lab at a real 

3782
02:49:03,910 --> 02:49:03,910
university,
do a real study and get real results and

3783
02:49:03,910 --> 02:49:08,231
see if we're right and let's calculate 
all the different numbers and does find 

3784
02:49:08,231 --> 02:49:08,250
finding larger

3785
02:49:08,250 --> 02:49:09,630
people,
smaller people,

3786
02:49:09,631 --> 02:49:10,800
women,
men,

3787
02:49:10,950 --> 02:49:13,530
guys like Carwyn with big,
giant hands,

3788
02:49:13,710 --> 02:49:17,470
which is always a a big factor.
Like George Foreman's hands,

3789
02:49:17,640 --> 02:49:21,390
George Foreman's hands,
remember equal Hams,

3790
02:49:21,660 --> 02:49:23,430
Hams,
same thing.

3791
02:49:23,950 --> 02:49:26,340
Then that's a massive thing,
right?

3792
02:49:26,490 --> 02:49:31,490
Having that,
it's like the difference between having 

3793
02:49:31,490 --> 02:49:31,490
a carpenter's finish hammer and having a
sledge hammer.

3794
02:49:31,490 --> 02:49:34,980
This amount of mass.
Like you'd look at car wins hands.

3795
02:49:34,981 --> 02:49:38,100
Like I shook hands with Corwin's.
It's like shaking hands with a laptop.

3796
02:49:38,310 --> 02:49:43,310
I mean this is this big giant thing that
grips ahold of your fucking hand and 

3797
02:49:43,310 --> 02:49:45,870
that's why when carwyn would hit people,
like when he hit Gonzaga,

3798
02:49:46,040 --> 02:49:51,040
he knocked out Gonzaga.
I mean he hit Gonzaga with like a sixth 

3799
02:49:51,040 --> 02:49:54,121
sense punch that just shut the lights 
out and it's because he's just got so 

3800
02:49:54,121 --> 02:49:55,110
much bass.
There's so much there.

3801
02:49:55,111 --> 02:49:58,260
There's so there's just a different sort
of weapon.

3802
02:49:58,330 --> 02:50:01,020
Yeah.
That a person who has smaller hands,

3803
02:50:01,080 --> 02:50:06,080
like a floyd mayweather is a guy who 
really could benefit from this 

3804
02:50:06,080 --> 02:50:06,780
technology too because he's always 
breaking his hands.

3805
02:50:06,990 --> 02:50:09,330
Floyd's had a bunch of handbrakes.
Vito Vito.

3806
02:50:09,440 --> 02:50:13,950
I was like a size nine foot.
It is not have big hands or big feet.

3807
02:50:13,951 --> 02:50:18,951
He's not like a big bone guy.
Like a car when or like [inaudible] 

3808
02:50:18,951 --> 02:50:19,920
Lesnar dcs is this.
Does he really?

3809
02:50:20,010 --> 02:50:21,480
Yeah,
because he's had and issues.

3810
02:50:21,481 --> 02:50:22,020
I'm like,
hey man,

3811
02:50:22,021 --> 02:50:24,690
try this out.
To say that he broke his hand a bunch.

3812
02:50:25,080 --> 02:50:30,080
So here's another thing.
We'd go back to the psychology of 

3813
02:50:30,080 --> 02:50:30,090
trading.
If you've broken your hands seven times,

3814
02:50:30,790 --> 02:50:34,590
all of a sudden you're back to training 
again and then you put the little gloves

3815
02:50:34,591 --> 02:50:35,970
on and inherently,
you know.

3816
02:50:37,590 --> 02:50:39,720
Yeah,
that's almost most most impressive about

3817
02:50:39,730 --> 02:50:43,950
detour is that the guy makes his debut 
in [inaudible] 97 at UFC 12.

3818
02:50:44,250 --> 02:50:47,330
Here is you have see what is,
what is he fighting?

3819
02:50:47,560 --> 02:50:49,830
[inaudible] was going to fight for the 
title.

3820
02:50:50,070 --> 02:50:52,860
What the fuck?
Ban Use soil.

3821
02:50:52,920 --> 02:50:54,660
That's insane.
16 years.

3822
02:50:54,690 --> 02:50:58,650
He's the only guy.
The only guy out of all those years.

3823
02:50:58,860 --> 02:51:03,860
Besides Dan,
but I mean he's sort of kind of 

3824
02:51:03,860 --> 02:51:05,190
eliminated Dan from that running with 
his last victory over Dan.

3825
02:51:05,400 --> 02:51:09,000
I mean Dan did he knock out shogun in 
his subsequent fight,

3826
02:51:09,001 --> 02:51:11,490
but you know,
shoguns not the same anymore either.

3827
02:51:11,491 --> 02:51:14,160
And shogun had Dan hurt just stand so 
fucking tough.

3828
02:51:14,610 --> 02:51:15,360
He's just so much.
Well,

3829
02:51:16,680 --> 02:51:18,280
so fucking for a year.
She,

3830
02:51:18,320 --> 02:51:21,730
I never scored a point on him.
Come on,

3831
02:51:21,790 --> 02:51:24,040
give me one tick that one time.
No,

3832
02:51:24,950 --> 02:51:26,860
I've never gotten a good position on 
him.

3833
02:51:27,880 --> 02:51:30,040
He always had that stupid power.
Oh yeah.

3834
02:51:30,041 --> 02:51:33,440
People knew there's video of data.
I don't know where it is of interest.

3835
02:51:33,441 --> 02:51:36,400
Yelling match.
This is probably in the 19 [inaudible].

3836
02:51:36,401 --> 02:51:41,401
He throws a headlock on the guy in a 
wrestling match and knocks the guy out 

3837
02:51:41,401 --> 02:51:41,401
with the headlock.
That guy gets up,

3838
02:51:41,401 --> 02:51:43,960
takes a minute and he's so dizzy.
He falls back down again.

3839
02:51:44,230 --> 02:51:46,810
Didn't head locked him right in the neck
while people knew.

3840
02:51:46,811 --> 02:51:49,840
If you're a power guy,
you'll people will find out in the first

3841
02:51:49,841 --> 02:51:52,760
week of training right away.
People at team quest when.

3842
02:51:52,761 --> 02:51:54,250
Oh Dan,
oh boy.

3843
02:51:54,490 --> 02:51:55,390
You know,
right away,

3844
02:51:55,450 --> 02:51:58,010
but he couldn't kick that hard.
These flexible flexibility.

3845
02:51:58,020 --> 02:51:59,140
His hips,
hamstrings,

3846
02:52:00,950 --> 02:52:01,810
you know,
it's funny.

3847
02:52:01,811 --> 02:52:04,690
His Dad is so inflexible.
You can't really bend his fingers back.

3848
02:52:04,810 --> 02:52:05,170
Dan's

3849
02:52:06,930 --> 02:52:07,990
Kevin,
his fingers,

3850
02:52:08,010 --> 02:52:09,930
not his dad was always like,
I can't go.

3851
02:52:09,940 --> 02:52:14,940
He couldn't come to this.
If you look at Danny that dense 

3852
02:52:14,940 --> 02:52:18,481
musculature,
there's no way you can get a guy like 

3853
02:52:18,481 --> 02:52:18,481
that to have flexible hips.
Here's the air thing,

3854
02:52:18,481 --> 02:52:19,420
hips,
her anatomy to.

3855
02:52:19,710 --> 02:52:21,130
I go back to gymnastics,
right?

3856
02:52:21,730 --> 02:52:26,730
There's a.
The the location and the angle of your 

3857
02:52:26,730 --> 02:52:28,690
hip joints will allow you to either be 
flexible or not.

3858
02:52:28,691 --> 02:52:33,691
Same with your shoulders.
So in gymnastics they check this very 

3859
02:52:33,691 --> 02:52:37,591
quick.
Like Orange County has probably some of 

3860
02:52:37,591 --> 02:52:38,740
the best gymnastics in the whole country
to the last five Olympic girls were from

3861
02:52:38,741 --> 02:52:40,360
Orange County.
So there's.

3862
02:52:40,361 --> 02:52:45,361
Oh yeah,
there's super high quality gyms with 

3863
02:52:45,361 --> 02:52:45,361
that.
And to become an Olympic gymnast,

3864
02:52:45,361 --> 02:52:46,750
there's so many things it has to have,
but it's like being a runway model.

3865
02:52:46,751 --> 02:52:49,450
You have to have this certain genetics 
or no matter what you do,

3866
02:52:49,451 --> 02:52:50,170
you can't make it.

3867
02:52:50,530 --> 02:52:53,860
If your hip joints are naturally like 
this and they need to be like this,

3868
02:52:53,861 --> 02:52:58,861
you can hear what you're doing with your
hands where people are not just the 

3869
02:52:58,861 --> 02:52:58,861
angle.
If you look at your hips,

3870
02:52:58,861 --> 02:53:03,181
there's an angle that they come off of 
depending on how your genetic anatomy 

3871
02:53:03,461 --> 02:53:05,770
turned out.
If it's one way or the other.

3872
02:53:06,100 --> 02:53:11,100
My daughter has hips that she can do.
She could do a split on this line and 

3873
02:53:11,100 --> 02:53:11,100
go,
oh,

3874
02:53:11,100 --> 02:53:11,870
she's a little girl and she's been 
practicing some.

3875
02:53:12,040 --> 02:53:13,450
Some little girls.
Can't ever do it.

3876
02:53:14,010 --> 02:53:16,210
Yeah.
If your hip joints are here,

3877
02:53:16,960 --> 02:53:19,780
the bony anatomy won't let them come all
the way off.

3878
02:53:19,980 --> 02:53:21,370
Is that scientific?
Because I've been.

3879
02:53:21,500 --> 02:53:24,250
You can love people.
They've taken people that have that.

3880
02:53:24,490 --> 02:53:29,490
You can look at them.
They do show that their flexibility 

3881
02:53:29,490 --> 02:53:29,490
flexibilities absolutely limited for 
sure,

3882
02:53:29,490 --> 02:53:29,850
and you'll see it in shoulders too 
though.

3883
02:53:29,850 --> 02:53:30,880
They'll say immediately,
oh,

3884
02:53:30,881 --> 02:53:31,930
that girl is tight.
Shoulders.

3885
02:53:32,050 --> 02:53:37,050
Can she get it?
The gymnast are the ones who figure it 

3886
02:53:37,050 --> 02:53:37,270
out.
We also train gymnastics too,

3887
02:53:37,271 --> 02:53:39,100
so it's a fascinating sport in that 
sense.

3888
02:53:39,130 --> 02:53:41,910
You trained gymnastics people at rain?
No,

3889
02:53:41,930 --> 02:53:42,520
no,
we.

3890
02:53:42,610 --> 02:53:46,360
We go to a gym train in gymnastics.
I've seen patent do that.

3891
02:53:46,390 --> 02:53:48,860
Is that because of your daughter and 
your connection?

3892
02:53:49,240 --> 02:53:52,390
We met her.
She was Arco Art gymnastics coach.

3893
02:53:52,391 --> 02:53:55,180
I have an Exec at a gym called scats in 
Huntington Beach.

3894
02:53:55,570 --> 02:54:00,570
He was my daughter's coach.
He left the gym and we just started 

3895
02:54:00,570 --> 02:54:00,970
training with Ivan.
No shift.

3896
02:54:01,100 --> 02:54:06,100
So what is the benefit of gymnastic 
training for something if you want to 

3897
02:54:06,100 --> 02:54:07,120
ever want to feel weak and 
uncoordinated,

3898
02:54:07,121 --> 02:54:12,121
come do some gymnastics with us.
I know George got really into 

3899
02:54:12,121 --> 02:54:12,121
gymnastics.
First of all,

3900
02:54:12,121 --> 02:54:15,040
you get super strong in the most 
functional way possible.

3901
02:54:15,070 --> 02:54:17,560
I mean looking at Olympic gym does.
If you want to see someone crazy,

3902
02:54:17,800 --> 02:54:22,800
the number one gymnast in the world or 
in a female gymnast is a girl named 

3903
02:54:22,800 --> 02:54:23,410
Simone biles.
Simone biles.

3904
02:54:23,411 --> 02:54:24,790
She just won the world championship.
Again,

3905
02:54:24,791 --> 02:54:27,550
if you watch her floor routine,
your mouth would fall open.

3906
02:54:27,551 --> 02:54:31,960
She's got got King Mo musculature and 
she's five foot nine is incredible as an

3907
02:54:31,961 --> 02:54:35,200
athlete can be to make it to that level 
in gymnastics.

3908
02:54:35,650 --> 02:54:38,740
All these things that have to happen,
but the genetics have to be there first.

3909
02:54:38,930 --> 02:54:41,680
Then you have to get super,
super ballsy to do high level.

3910
02:54:41,681 --> 02:54:46,681
Gymnastics is a level of bravery that 
most people will never really fully 

3911
02:54:46,681 --> 02:54:48,700
flipping through the air and shit and 
hoping you don't land on your feet.

3912
02:54:48,701 --> 02:54:50,630
It's like it's controls the girl.
Yeah.

3913
02:54:50,650 --> 02:54:52,180
Look at her.
Oh my God.

3914
02:54:52,181 --> 02:54:54,280
But what she does,
we're going to lay this.

3915
02:54:55,240 --> 02:54:57,440
Oh my God.
She doesn't even look real.

3916
02:54:57,550 --> 02:54:58,630
No,
she does.

3917
02:54:58,631 --> 02:55:01,000
That's insane.
Again,

3918
02:55:01,001 --> 02:55:03,610
Simone Biles,
she does last name [inaudible].

3919
02:55:03,650 --> 02:55:06,220
It's B l e s.
Oh my God.

3920
02:55:06,440 --> 02:55:08,750
And I think.
Look at this.

3921
02:55:08,840 --> 02:55:11,060
Oh my God.
These flips are insane.

3922
02:55:11,061 --> 02:55:12,740
Oh my God.
She planted.

3923
02:55:13,730 --> 02:55:15,800
Holy Shit.
She's incredible.

3924
02:55:15,890 --> 02:55:18,320
This to me is the greatest athlete I've 
ever seen.

3925
02:55:18,800 --> 02:55:21,410
Whoa.
Yeah.

3926
02:55:21,411 --> 02:55:23,150
If you could teach that checks.
I'm Emma.

3927
02:55:23,270 --> 02:55:26,090
You imagine what you would do two checks
while she was on it for nine,

3928
02:55:26,091 --> 02:55:27,650
so no reason ever.
Hundred,

3929
02:55:27,651 --> 02:55:28,970
15 pounds.
That's good.

3930
02:55:29,180 --> 02:55:34,180
So yeah,
the gymnastics training was w it 

3931
02:55:34,180 --> 02:55:36,260
develops your ways.
She's probably 90 pounds for nine,

3932
02:55:37,040 --> 02:55:40,700
so we needed something below strawweight
for women.

3933
02:55:40,701 --> 02:55:45,701
That's probably a good idea anywhere.
There's a lot of women that are a 

3934
02:55:45,701 --> 02:55:45,701
hundred pounds.
She's four nine.

3935
02:55:45,701 --> 02:55:46,250
And how old is she?
17.

3936
02:55:46,340 --> 02:55:51,230
Jesus Christ fucking flips.
That's insane.

3937
02:55:51,740 --> 02:55:53,810
The way she sticks it is incredible.

3938
02:55:54,380 --> 02:55:56,660
Yeah,
so w we started doing gymnastics because

3939
02:55:56,661 --> 02:56:01,661
it gives you a body centered awareness 
that you can't get anywhere else and it 

3940
02:56:02,200 --> 02:56:05,750
requires so much strength and how do you
stop?

3941
02:56:05,751 --> 02:56:08,930
How do you do it?
Like with the MMA training,

3942
02:56:09,290 --> 02:56:13,070
the first thing we had to figure out was
what can you do and what can't you do?

3943
02:56:13,130 --> 02:56:18,130
Oh my God.
Because when we first started going 

3944
02:56:18,130 --> 02:56:18,130
there that we did some things and I had 
a shoulder injury that it's like,

3945
02:56:18,130 --> 02:56:18,980
okay,
we can't do that.

3946
02:56:19,060 --> 02:56:24,060
You are not a young girl or young kid.
You had a shoulder injury from 

3947
02:56:24,060 --> 02:56:24,060
gymnastics.
Yeah.

3948
02:56:24,060 --> 02:56:26,630
We've got so excited.
We just started to do some stuff that we

3949
02:56:26,631 --> 02:56:31,631
didn't know was stuff we were doing.
We tried to vault and the act of 

3950
02:56:32,601 --> 02:56:34,970
blocking on the vault,
which we initially thought would be good

3951
02:56:34,971 --> 02:56:37,760
for throwing punches and snapping my 
shoulder.

3952
02:56:38,300 --> 02:56:39,700
We're not having that.
Right.

3953
02:56:40,130 --> 02:56:41,930
So we do a lot of work on the parallel 
bars,

3954
02:56:41,931 --> 02:56:46,931
a lot of work doing gymnastics as well.
I've got to get my.

3955
02:56:47,860 --> 02:56:49,370
Get my work.
Can you do a flip?

3956
02:56:49,700 --> 02:56:50,810
Oh yeah.
You can do a flip.

3957
02:56:50,811 --> 02:56:52,970
Like standing on the ultimate fighter.
It's on tape.

3958
02:56:53,030 --> 02:56:54,770
But did you not do that before you 
start?

3959
02:56:55,340 --> 02:56:57,500
I did gymnastics as a kid.
Did you really?

3960
02:56:57,650 --> 02:56:59,160
First Sport was ski jumping,
seconds,

3961
02:56:59,180 --> 02:57:01,910
gymnastics.
Third was wrestlers sport with ski jump.

3962
02:57:01,911 --> 02:57:03,360
I lived in New Hampshire,
maniac.

3963
02:57:03,440 --> 02:57:05,120
I lived.
I lived in New Hampshire.

3964
02:57:05,121 --> 02:57:07,100
I started in TV.
I told my dad I want to do that.

3965
02:57:07,520 --> 02:57:12,520
He must have been so happy.
My little boy is going to fly through 

3966
02:57:12,520 --> 02:57:12,740
the air and hopefully not break his 
neck.

3967
02:57:12,830 --> 02:57:14,090
Yeah.
Wow.

3968
02:57:14,720 --> 02:57:16,670
So no,
I had done gymnastics.

3969
02:57:16,671 --> 02:57:18,710
It was always something like that'd be 
cool.

3970
02:57:18,711 --> 02:57:19,490
The train that again.

3971
02:57:19,490 --> 02:57:24,490
And then through my daughter's 
gymnastics we had the opportunity to do 

3972
02:57:24,490 --> 02:57:27,431
it.
And so are you seeing the tangible 

3973
02:57:27,431 --> 02:57:30,050
benefits with guys like pat utilizing 
gymnastics training?

3974
02:57:30,051 --> 02:57:32,150
Are you seeing that?
Are you seeing like people.

3975
02:57:32,330 --> 02:57:34,130
I guess the whole thing is,
are you feeling good?

3976
02:57:34,131 --> 02:57:35,260
Are you doing well?
Right,

3977
02:57:35,600 --> 02:57:40,600
right.
And Tom Watson trains a ton of 

3978
02:57:40,600 --> 02:57:41,110
gymnastics now to Caitlyn comes and 
trains with us.

3979
02:57:41,111 --> 02:57:42,490
Yeah,
it's it.

3980
02:57:42,800 --> 02:57:44,810
You should come down and do this.
Such a fun,

3981
02:57:44,811 --> 02:57:49,811
amazing.
Live so fucking far away or not even 

3982
02:57:49,811 --> 02:57:53,231
that far away.
It's just la traffic is such horse shit 

3983
02:57:53,231 --> 02:57:55,100
you did on a Sunday or something when 
family time for me most of the time.

3984
02:57:55,440 --> 02:57:56,140
All right.
We'll write.

3985
02:57:56,210 --> 02:57:57,470
We'll never do it.
We'll never do it.

3986
02:57:57,471 --> 02:57:58,720
But uh,
if I,

3987
02:57:59,060 --> 02:58:01,090
if you find a place up here to do a 
private gymnasts,

3988
02:58:01,120 --> 02:58:03,180
you get on the parallel bars,
you just swinging dips,

3989
02:58:03,181 --> 02:58:04,430
you get on the rings and you.

3990
02:58:04,660 --> 02:58:05,420
Yeah.
Trey,

3991
02:58:05,540 --> 02:58:10,540
you know,
muscle ups and dips and handstands and 

3992
02:58:10,540 --> 02:58:10,540
it's an amazing workout.
Yeah.

3993
02:58:10,540 --> 02:58:11,010
It seems like it would be.
I mean,

3994
02:58:11,011 --> 02:58:16,011
I'm big on bodyweight stuff.
I do a lot of body weight squats and I 

3995
02:58:16,011 --> 02:58:20,161
do a lot of Chin ups and they do a lot 
of things is there's no better body 

3996
02:58:20,161 --> 02:58:20,230
weight workout than gymnastics.
No.

3997
02:58:20,340 --> 02:58:23,010
I would imagine that comes into play a 
lot.

3998
02:58:23,070 --> 02:58:28,070
The number one male,
a gymnast in the world is at that gym 

3999
02:58:28,070 --> 02:58:31,750
that that was his home gym.
He's now at like Michigan state or 

4000
02:58:31,750 --> 02:58:34,701
something,
so we went and watched him and his 

4001
02:58:34,701 --> 02:58:36,670
teammate workout esmail did gymnastics 
right in front of you was a crazy 

4002
02:58:36,670 --> 02:58:41,511
experience.
So I see one of them doing as a ring 

4003
02:58:41,511 --> 02:58:41,511
routine.
If you've ever seen a top ring,

4004
02:58:41,511 --> 02:58:43,080
Richard,
and right now it just looks in rain.

4005
02:58:43,081 --> 02:58:45,540
Guards are giant to the ridiculous arms.

4006
02:58:45,780 --> 02:58:47,160
Yeah,
they're all huge,

4007
02:58:47,161 --> 02:58:48,500
right?
So he does this ring routine.

4008
02:58:48,540 --> 02:58:53,540
I go,
what happens if you take a month off 

4009
02:58:53,540 --> 02:58:53,540
because I can't do any of that a month 
ago,

4010
02:58:53,540 --> 02:58:53,580
go,
you're kidding.

4011
02:58:53,581 --> 02:58:54,150
He goes,
no.

4012
02:58:54,510 --> 02:58:57,630
So they have to continually do it,
continue to do so.

4013
02:58:57,631 --> 02:59:02,631
We go do gymnastics.
Whatever progress we feel that we're 

4014
02:59:02,631 --> 02:59:02,631
making,
you would take a week,

4015
02:59:02,631 --> 02:59:03,070
a week.
That's all gone.

4016
02:59:03,100 --> 02:59:08,100
That's amazing because it's such an 
unnatural thing to be swinging like a 

4017
02:59:08,100 --> 02:59:08,490
chimp on,
on the rings.

4018
02:59:08,520 --> 02:59:13,520
He just have.
It's a level of strength and body 

4019
02:59:13,520 --> 02:59:16,161
control that exists in no other sport 
and it's all about this perfection in 

4020
02:59:16,161 --> 02:59:18,720
perfect form and perfect movement.
It's fun.

4021
02:59:19,590 --> 02:59:21,590
Do you,
are you concerned at all to doing that?

4022
02:59:21,600 --> 02:59:24,810
Puts a lot of stress on the ligaments 
and joints and I said,

4023
02:59:24,811 --> 02:59:29,811
well,
we figured out pretty quick what we can 

4024
02:59:29,811 --> 02:59:29,811
be doing.
What we can't do in.

4025
02:59:29,811 --> 02:59:29,811
We just ran out of time,
dude.

4026
02:59:29,811 --> 02:59:31,500
We just did it three fucking hours.
A long time.

4027
02:59:31,770 --> 02:59:34,050
Flew by,
but fun.

4028
02:59:34,080 --> 02:59:35,610
Thanks for having me,
Brian Parsons.

4029
02:59:35,611 --> 02:59:37,850
You're a bad motherfucker.
It was good talking to brother.

4030
02:59:37,900 --> 02:59:39,900
I always a pleasure to do this more 
often.

4031
02:59:40,110 --> 02:59:45,110
Let's do this and let's.
Let's keep up with progress and tell me 

4032
02:59:45,110 --> 02:59:45,110
how fighters are doing all kinds of 
shifts off.

4033
02:59:45,110 --> 02:59:47,700
I'll come back whenever you want.
And these gloves.

4034
02:59:47,701 --> 02:59:50,190
How can people get ahold of them or they
sale yet there?

4035
02:59:50,280 --> 02:59:53,110
