1
00:00:04,510 --> 00:00:04,751
Oh,

2
00:00:04,751 --> 00:00:05,710
here we go.

3
00:00:05,800 --> 00:00:09,250
You dirty bitches a certain point in time,

4
00:00:09,251 --> 00:00:10,510
I'm going to run out of dirty bitches.

5
00:00:10,900 --> 00:00:14,110
He can only call people dirty bitches
so many before he'd come like a form of

6
00:00:14,111 --> 00:00:14,944
self parody,

7
00:00:15,340 --> 00:00:17,350
but it hasn't reached that point yet.

8
00:00:18,220 --> 00:00:18,640
I don't know.

9
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:19,030
It'll,

10
00:00:19,030 --> 00:00:19,990
I'll know when it's there.

11
00:00:20,440 --> 00:00:20,771
You know?

12
00:00:20,771 --> 00:00:25,030
It's like that saying that was cool and
then all of a sudden it's like you'll be

13
00:00:25,031 --> 00:00:27,340
sponsored by dove soap and then
you won't be able to say it.

14
00:00:27,341 --> 00:00:27,820
And it's like,

15
00:00:27,820 --> 00:00:31,030
do you remember when that
fuck you song came out?

16
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:32,153
Yeah.

17
00:00:32,230 --> 00:00:32,920
See it green.

18
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:33,520
Yeah.

19
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:37,000
That song was fucking
amazing when it came out.

20
00:00:37,660 --> 00:00:41,530
I mean that dude's like harmonious
voice and you know saying,

21
00:00:41,531 --> 00:00:42,760
fuck you.

22
00:00:42,970 --> 00:00:45,730
You know what everybody really wants to
say when you get your heart ripped out

23
00:00:45,731 --> 00:00:46,600
of your chest.

24
00:00:47,410 --> 00:00:49,060
I need to drive it around town.

25
00:00:49,390 --> 00:00:52,630
Another dude's driving around town
with the girl you love and you're like,

26
00:00:52,631 --> 00:00:53,470
fuck you.

27
00:00:54,250 --> 00:00:57,210
But then somewhere along the line
they talk to that dude in the change,

28
00:00:57,211 --> 00:00:58,450
in the words to forget,

29
00:00:58,451 --> 00:00:59,130
you know,

30
00:00:59,130 --> 00:01:00,040
that's just the radio part.

31
00:01:00,190 --> 00:01:03,370
It doesn't matter when they
talked to him and to doing that,

32
00:01:03,430 --> 00:01:04,900
a little piece of the world died.

33
00:01:05,320 --> 00:01:05,621
They,

34
00:01:05,621 --> 00:01:06,640
there's a song called

35
00:01:07,610 --> 00:01:08,730
turned into a mall,

36
00:01:09,210 --> 00:01:13,290
a little piece of the world that not
even the mall that Santa's set up at the

37
00:01:13,291 --> 00:01:18,291
mall where there's like the stupidest
looking fake fucking snow on the ground

38
00:01:19,620 --> 00:01:23,040
and a little wooden fucking fake deer.

39
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:24,810
Like don't even try and like,

40
00:01:24,811 --> 00:01:26,010
they're not really trying to trick you.

41
00:01:26,050 --> 00:01:30,460
They're like sort of represents Sanas
workshop and this stupid dude pretending

42
00:01:30,461 --> 00:01:30,930
to be sick.

43
00:01:30,930 --> 00:01:34,800
That's what it became
where it was raw and real.

44
00:01:35,370 --> 00:01:35,791
I'm like,

45
00:01:35,791 --> 00:01:36,571
fuck you.

46
00:01:36,571 --> 00:01:36,991
Yeah,

47
00:01:36,991 --> 00:01:37,860
fuck you.

48
00:01:38,610 --> 00:01:39,150
And he's like,

49
00:01:39,150 --> 00:01:39,571
I'm like,

50
00:01:39,571 --> 00:01:42,600
forget you what?

51
00:01:43,870 --> 00:01:47,410
There's this song called thrift shop and
they have to edit it just like that for

52
00:01:47,411 --> 00:01:49,160
the radio and but it,

53
00:01:49,180 --> 00:01:54,180
they edited so much stupid things like
the edit honky out the word Honky,

54
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:59,020
I'm offended by that word or that you
smell like or it smells like r Kelly's

55
00:01:59,021 --> 00:01:59,520
pis.

56
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:00,490
They edited that out.

57
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:01,480
I wish we could elevate

58
00:02:01,550 --> 00:02:03,340
Beta honky to the level of nigger.

59
00:02:03,490 --> 00:02:07,930
I wish we could have a word that was
just as effective for a black person.

60
00:02:07,931 --> 00:02:08,051
Do you?

61
00:02:08,051 --> 00:02:10,660
So it would be an even war
because of the way it is now.

62
00:02:10,661 --> 00:02:15,340
It's like us versus
Yugoslavia or something.

63
00:02:15,341 --> 00:02:15,761
You know what I mean?

64
00:02:15,761 --> 00:02:19,180
Like some small country that
doesn't have nuclear weapons,

65
00:02:19,420 --> 00:02:22,300
like the amount of power
that the United States has,

66
00:02:22,301 --> 00:02:25,210
it's ridiculous for them
to try to hurl their,

67
00:02:25,220 --> 00:02:26,051
their weaponry,

68
00:02:26,051 --> 00:02:26,884
our way.

69
00:02:26,950 --> 00:02:27,970
We'll verbally,

70
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:28,811
that's what it is.

71
00:02:28,811 --> 00:02:31,810
White to black cause niggers,

72
00:02:31,811 --> 00:02:33,160
the ultimate nuclear weapon.

73
00:02:33,161 --> 00:02:34,840
It's like you're gonna fight.

74
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:36,160
Someone's going to fight you.

75
00:02:36,370 --> 00:02:38,950
They will beat the fuck out
of you for using that word.

76
00:02:39,850 --> 00:02:41,200
There's no white equivalent.

77
00:02:41,230 --> 00:02:42,370
It doesn't even exist.

78
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:43,690
There's no white equivalent,

79
00:02:43,691 --> 00:02:46,060
no dehumanizing white equivalent.

80
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:46,961
You know,

81
00:02:46,961 --> 00:02:47,491
like the,

82
00:02:47,491 --> 00:02:47,861
the,

83
00:02:47,861 --> 00:02:49,360
the idea of saying that word.

84
00:02:49,361 --> 00:02:49,810
It's like a,

85
00:02:49,810 --> 00:02:53,860
it dehumanizes people because
the guy slavery connotations.

86
00:02:53,890 --> 00:02:54,880
A Mazda Gotti though,

87
00:02:54,890 --> 00:02:57,700
she said that is a deep inside NMH.

88
00:02:57,730 --> 00:02:58,563
Okay.

89
00:02:59,400 --> 00:02:59,840
Um,

90
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:00,673
that's Adam.

91
00:03:00,770 --> 00:03:01,630
That's Adam Hunter ways.

92
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:02,150
Gentlemen.

93
00:03:02,150 --> 00:03:04,220
This podcast has a couple of sponsors.

94
00:03:04,270 --> 00:03:05,390
She fucking get those out of the way.

95
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:06,831
But we did an already,

96
00:03:06,831 --> 00:03:08,390
we already started a real podcast.

97
00:03:08,900 --> 00:03:10,310
Maybe it's better this way for us.

98
00:03:10,340 --> 00:03:10,910
Maybe,

99
00:03:10,910 --> 00:03:13,970
maybe you won't feel so bad
that we talk about sponsors.

100
00:03:14,210 --> 00:03:14,630
Um,

101
00:03:14,630 --> 00:03:16,860
the only thing that will promise and,

102
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:17,660
uh,

103
00:03:17,660 --> 00:03:19,580
always and if were incorrect about this,

104
00:03:19,610 --> 00:03:19,891
we'll,

105
00:03:19,891 --> 00:03:20,724
we'll let you know,

106
00:03:20,950 --> 00:03:21,260
um,

107
00:03:21,260 --> 00:03:23,720
is that anything that
we get involved with,

108
00:03:23,721 --> 00:03:27,110
we believe is a legitimate con company
that's trying to sell you good shit.

109
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:31,820
We're not really interested in selling
you something that's useless and we're

110
00:03:31,821 --> 00:03:33,920
not interested in
selling you bad products.

111
00:03:34,310 --> 00:03:38,960
And I was having a conversation online
today with someone who is upset about one

112
00:03:38,961 --> 00:03:41,270
of our sponsors and that
that sponsor is ting.

113
00:03:42,340 --> 00:03:43,310
This guy's an idiot.

114
00:03:43,330 --> 00:03:43,970
But the con,

115
00:03:43,970 --> 00:03:45,590
the conversation was so dumb.

116
00:03:46,430 --> 00:03:46,820
Um,

117
00:03:46,820 --> 00:03:50,810
one of the things he was mad at is that
it's on the sprint's network is a CDMA

118
00:03:50,811 --> 00:03:54,200
network and so he can't
use the phone overseas.

119
00:03:54,340 --> 00:03:54,651
And I'm like,

120
00:03:54,651 --> 00:03:55,790
well that's just because it's,

121
00:03:55,791 --> 00:03:56,100
it's,

122
00:03:56,100 --> 00:03:56,610
it's a,

123
00:03:56,610 --> 00:03:57,920
it's a sprint network.

124
00:03:57,980 --> 00:03:58,800
That's what it is.

125
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:00,020
It's an American network.

126
00:04:00,021 --> 00:04:02,690
Like there's only two American
networks that are CDMA,

127
00:04:02,930 --> 00:04:04,460
that's Verizon and sprint.

128
00:04:04,820 --> 00:04:06,800
And you can't use those overseas.

129
00:04:06,830 --> 00:04:08,870
If you want to use Verizon overseas,

130
00:04:08,871 --> 00:04:10,370
you have to have a,

131
00:04:10,430 --> 00:04:11,263
um,

132
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:11,860
a,

133
00:04:11,860 --> 00:04:13,670
a dual country card.

134
00:04:13,700 --> 00:04:15,650
You have to have a GSM
chip inside the phone.

135
00:04:15,651 --> 00:04:18,380
So it has essentially
as to two radios in it.

136
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:21,530
So when you're overseas
it kicks in the GSM one,

137
00:04:21,531 --> 00:04:22,690
it becomes a world phone.

138
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:26,110
Does he live overseas and or does he
just travel in your lives overseas?

139
00:04:26,190 --> 00:04:27,480
But he's in America I guess.

140
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:30,480
And he was upset that he can't take it
with them to his control over the roof.

141
00:04:30,510 --> 00:04:31,770
Fucking read it dude.

142
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:32,221
If you're in a,

143
00:04:32,221 --> 00:04:36,300
you're a specialized situation for
someone in America wants to like talk to

144
00:04:36,301 --> 00:04:38,460
people from America,

145
00:04:38,590 --> 00:04:40,680
you can call other countries from here.

146
00:04:40,890 --> 00:04:42,180
It's an awesome service.

147
00:04:42,420 --> 00:04:44,070
So be aware of that.

148
00:04:44,071 --> 00:04:44,401
There's I,

149
00:04:44,401 --> 00:04:47,340
there's only a few countries
that still use CDMA,

150
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:50,850
which is interesting because apparently
CDMA is like the older technology,

151
00:04:51,180 --> 00:04:54,510
but it goes deeper into
buildings apparently.

152
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:57,540
That's why a lot of people that
say they have Verizon and sprint,

153
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:58,020
they,

154
00:04:58,020 --> 00:05:01,590
they will say that they get better
coverage than people who have GSM.

155
00:05:01,591 --> 00:05:02,460
They have like at and.

156
00:05:02,461 --> 00:05:02,940
T.

157
00:05:02,940 --> 00:05:03,773
I find it,

158
00:05:03,780 --> 00:05:04,530
see him,

159
00:05:04,530 --> 00:05:06,450
at least in La.

160
00:05:06,450 --> 00:05:09,360
CDMA is definitely better
for like not dropping calls.

161
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:10,713
That's what I thought.

162
00:05:10,980 --> 00:05:11,700
You don't know about that.

163
00:05:11,700 --> 00:05:11,851
You're,

164
00:05:11,851 --> 00:05:12,610
you're okay.

165
00:05:12,610 --> 00:05:13,480
I have,

166
00:05:13,540 --> 00:05:17,620
well I have a 18 t iPhone
five and then I have a Ipad,

167
00:05:17,700 --> 00:05:18,010
uh,

168
00:05:18,010 --> 00:05:18,843
Verizon,

169
00:05:18,870 --> 00:05:19,360
right.

170
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:20,193
My Shit,

171
00:05:20,290 --> 00:05:21,550
at least their data network.

172
00:05:21,580 --> 00:05:24,430
I can never get fucking
data on my fucking iPad.

173
00:05:24,431 --> 00:05:25,750
But then I look at my other phone,

174
00:05:25,751 --> 00:05:25,990
I'm like,

175
00:05:25,990 --> 00:05:26,111
oh,

176
00:05:26,111 --> 00:05:29,800
I couldn't make a hotspot on my at t
and t networks on my Verizon iPad will

177
00:05:29,801 --> 00:05:30,190
work.

178
00:05:30,190 --> 00:05:31,870
Did you do that and was it more effective?

179
00:05:31,900 --> 00:05:32,200
Yeah.

180
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:34,820
So you think that data is more
effective than what region?

181
00:05:34,900 --> 00:05:39,620
It just seems like it just seems like
where in La that it's the at and t is

182
00:05:39,621 --> 00:05:41,110
pretty solid in la now.

183
00:05:41,260 --> 00:05:42,250
Like you're in Texas,

184
00:05:42,251 --> 00:05:44,340
you're probably running around
on cricket or something.

185
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:45,451
Seemed like it was,

186
00:05:45,451 --> 00:05:49,260
I used a t for a while and then when I
switched over to Verizon I noticed a big

187
00:05:49,261 --> 00:05:49,770
difference.

188
00:05:49,770 --> 00:05:51,030
I thought it was much better.

189
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:55,290
And I find that the same places that
I could make calls with Verizon,

190
00:05:55,291 --> 00:05:56,970
I can pretty much make calls with sprint,

191
00:05:57,050 --> 00:05:57,883
seems to be,

192
00:05:58,130 --> 00:06:00,320
at least in the of the
issue places that I had,

193
00:06:00,610 --> 00:06:01,130
you know,

194
00:06:01,130 --> 00:06:01,360
I,

195
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:01,850
I,

196
00:06:01,850 --> 00:06:04,430
but as far as like a data networks,

197
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:06,110
those data networks are those,

198
00:06:06,140 --> 00:06:07,130
those are funky man.

199
00:06:07,210 --> 00:06:11,240
Let's fucking online like four g
laptop chips that you put in your,

200
00:06:11,420 --> 00:06:12,140
you know,

201
00:06:12,140 --> 00:06:13,340
those are a little wonky,

202
00:06:13,370 --> 00:06:15,470
like don't be trying to
download anything big,

203
00:06:15,710 --> 00:06:15,980
you know,

204
00:06:15,980 --> 00:06:17,600
don't be thinking you're really online.

205
00:06:19,350 --> 00:06:23,730
You're on some weird thing that's like
sorta online but it's not really online.

206
00:06:23,731 --> 00:06:25,310
And if you have you get frisky,

207
00:06:25,311 --> 00:06:26,720
it'll fucking kick you off.

208
00:06:26,900 --> 00:06:27,381
You know,

209
00:06:27,381 --> 00:06:29,420
look at this dude tried
to download a movie,

210
00:06:29,421 --> 00:06:30,680
bitch the fuck out of here.

211
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:34,820
There's disconnect you tingling
and do that then not like that.

212
00:06:35,570 --> 00:06:36,403
They're nice.

213
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:37,100
Uh,

214
00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:37,600
the,

215
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:41,030
this is the criticism that this guy
had said in a forum and then not to,

216
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:42,170
you know,

217
00:06:42,170 --> 00:06:43,430
make his point like,

218
00:06:43,431 --> 00:06:43,760
uh,

219
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:44,211
any,

220
00:06:44,211 --> 00:06:44,570
uh,

221
00:06:44,570 --> 00:06:46,250
bigger or grander than it was.

222
00:06:46,251 --> 00:06:47,930
But he,

223
00:06:48,230 --> 00:06:52,550
the idea was that Ting
wasn't a non he evil company.

224
00:06:52,890 --> 00:06:54,470
I think it's forum posts said,

225
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:58,010
stop saying that Ting
is a non evil company,

226
00:06:58,040 --> 00:07:02,670
that they're evil for having
CDMA and I guess maybe they,

227
00:07:02,700 --> 00:07:04,130
they do something with the,

228
00:07:04,550 --> 00:07:06,260
the operating system to sprint,

229
00:07:06,270 --> 00:07:06,741
do something.

230
00:07:06,741 --> 00:07:08,570
I know they put their own brand on it,

231
00:07:08,750 --> 00:07:12,290
but I think the whole thing that people
love about android phones apparently is

232
00:07:12,291 --> 00:07:14,750
that if you really want
to get crazy with them,

233
00:07:14,751 --> 00:07:15,690
you can jailbreak.

234
00:07:15,770 --> 00:07:17,090
I'm like super easy.

235
00:07:17,091 --> 00:07:18,530
He can route them or whatever it is.

236
00:07:18,620 --> 00:07:22,040
I know somebody that just made their
phone look like a exactly like it's a

237
00:07:22,041 --> 00:07:23,870
windows seven phone or eight phone.

238
00:07:24,610 --> 00:07:25,000
I'm like,

239
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:25,250
ah,

240
00:07:25,250 --> 00:07:25,730
that's,

241
00:07:25,730 --> 00:07:26,470
that's horrible.

242
00:07:26,470 --> 00:07:27,590
Don't ever show that to me.

243
00:07:27,591 --> 00:07:30,830
I know you can do weird
stuff with those androids.

244
00:07:30,831 --> 00:07:31,720
That's one of the things.

245
00:07:32,710 --> 00:07:33,543
Yeah,

246
00:07:33,610 --> 00:07:34,443
I die.

247
00:07:34,540 --> 00:07:35,800
I can't get involved with that.

248
00:07:35,830 --> 00:07:38,200
I can't be fucking around
what it comes with.

249
00:07:38,260 --> 00:07:39,220
That's what I'm going to keep.

250
00:07:39,580 --> 00:07:41,020
I really don't have the time,

251
00:07:41,050 --> 00:07:45,160
but I do appreciate that it's available
to people that want to do that kind of

252
00:07:45,161 --> 00:07:45,491
shit.

253
00:07:45,491 --> 00:07:46,324
If you're one of them.

254
00:07:46,420 --> 00:07:50,620
Hack sores type dudes that likes to
get in your phone and fuck around.

255
00:07:51,100 --> 00:07:51,933
I used to be like that.

256
00:07:51,940 --> 00:07:54,040
I think I'd be at an android
user if I was 10 years ago.

257
00:07:54,190 --> 00:07:55,740
If you go to [inaudible] dot tv.com

258
00:07:55,740 --> 00:07:58,230
you can save 25 bucks off of,

259
00:07:58,231 --> 00:07:58,980
uh,

260
00:07:58,980 --> 00:07:59,461
off of,

261
00:07:59,461 --> 00:07:59,620
uh,

262
00:07:59,620 --> 00:08:03,060
any phone or service or
a credit device discount,

263
00:08:03,061 --> 00:08:03,894
25 bucks.

264
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:05,510
But prisons,

265
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:10,520
you previously it was a
$50 device discount and now
you can apply the $25 total

266
00:08:12,481 --> 00:08:17,481
discount to either the service or towards
a new device if you go to and the dot

267
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:21,390
[inaudible] dot com but you said you
can still find it for 50 bucks online.

268
00:08:21,660 --> 00:08:21,841
Hey,

269
00:08:21,841 --> 00:08:22,441
check out this,

270
00:08:22,441 --> 00:08:26,280
just Google ting review and
just go to the first line.

271
00:08:26,281 --> 00:08:28,920
And then they have a really
nice write up of Ting and it's,

272
00:08:28,921 --> 00:08:29,200
you know,

273
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:32,250
cuts through through it and there might
be a thing that you can click on and be

274
00:08:32,251 --> 00:08:33,600
able to get $50 off.

275
00:08:35,030 --> 00:08:38,810
Welcome to tinker with that
promotion code from our partner.

276
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:41,500
You get $50 off many
devices and online that

277
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:42,920
am I apply this discount.

278
00:08:42,950 --> 00:08:43,221
Sorry.

279
00:08:43,221 --> 00:08:43,730
Rogan,

280
00:08:43,730 --> 00:08:44,563
I'm Outta here,

281
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:45,260
dude.

282
00:08:45,260 --> 00:08:47,750
I got shafted for 25 bucks.

283
00:08:48,350 --> 00:08:50,060
They took a $25 gamble on me.

284
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,260
I tell you the coolest thing though about
thing is when you actually sign up for

285
00:08:54,261 --> 00:08:57,330
Ting and you actually get
through the whole entire process,

286
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:58,260
they have a new,

287
00:08:58,260 --> 00:09:01,680
a different drawing and like they have
these weird drawings on tanning Jesus.

288
00:09:01,850 --> 00:09:02,011
No,

289
00:09:02,011 --> 00:09:02,701
that's bringing in Walsh,

290
00:09:02,701 --> 00:09:03,050
I think.

291
00:09:03,050 --> 00:09:03,883
I think he's crying.

292
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:05,333
No,

293
00:09:06,390 --> 00:09:06,691
no.

294
00:09:06,691 --> 00:09:07,860
Brian Walsh doesn't cry.

295
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:08,933
Jesus Christ.

296
00:09:09,010 --> 00:09:09,843
That's teases him.

297
00:09:09,950 --> 00:09:10,170
But,

298
00:09:10,170 --> 00:09:11,290
but like when you sign up,

299
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:14,230
there's like this really hot chick and
she's like jumping up and down type

300
00:09:14,231 --> 00:09:14,411
thing.

301
00:09:14,411 --> 00:09:15,250
So really?

302
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:15,431
Yeah.

303
00:09:15,431 --> 00:09:18,160
So it's the only way you can see
it is if you actually sign up.

304
00:09:18,510 --> 00:09:19,343
Hmm.

305
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:19,911
Oh,

306
00:09:19,911 --> 00:09:20,750
that's ridiculous.

307
00:09:21,590 --> 00:09:22,850
Why not just show me the pictures?

308
00:09:22,851 --> 00:09:23,140
Why?

309
00:09:23,140 --> 00:09:24,410
Why don't you fucking play games?

310
00:09:25,130 --> 00:09:25,963
Um,

311
00:09:26,020 --> 00:09:26,300
what,

312
00:09:26,300 --> 00:09:27,440
what we like about Ting,

313
00:09:27,470 --> 00:09:28,280
first of all,

314
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:29,270
there's a,

315
00:09:29,300 --> 00:09:32,150
there's no contracts or ETF.

316
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:33,470
What does ETFs?

317
00:09:34,190 --> 00:09:35,150
Probably electronic.

318
00:09:37,670 --> 00:09:37,881
Yeah.

319
00:09:37,881 --> 00:09:38,714
What does that mean?

320
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:40,970
It says no contracts or ETFs.

321
00:09:41,030 --> 00:09:42,020
Should we know what that means?

322
00:09:42,650 --> 00:09:43,071
Truly.

323
00:09:43,071 --> 00:09:44,660
Incompletely contract free.

324
00:09:44,661 --> 00:09:46,550
No early termination fees.

325
00:09:46,580 --> 00:09:46,821
Oh,

326
00:09:46,821 --> 00:09:48,020
early termination fees.

327
00:09:48,590 --> 00:09:52,730
So you don't have early termination
fees when you cancel your cell phones.

328
00:09:53,060 --> 00:09:54,350
Like if you can't see your contract,

329
00:09:54,351 --> 00:09:55,280
if you a three year contract,

330
00:09:55,460 --> 00:09:56,780
you have to pay you all the money.

331
00:09:57,230 --> 00:09:57,590
Uh,

332
00:09:57,590 --> 00:10:00,470
no bundling or riding along services.

333
00:10:00,471 --> 00:10:01,550
And so they have,

334
00:10:01,990 --> 00:10:02,823
um,

335
00:10:03,350 --> 00:10:05,660
no overage charges or penalties.

336
00:10:05,661 --> 00:10:07,610
If you use more than
you thought you would,

337
00:10:07,611 --> 00:10:09,290
you just pay for what you used.

338
00:10:09,470 --> 00:10:12,140
You also get credits on unused service.

339
00:10:12,180 --> 00:10:13,340
This is where it's crazy.

340
00:10:13,610 --> 00:10:15,440
If you use a less than
you thought you would,

341
00:10:15,441 --> 00:10:20,300
tank drops you down to the level you hit
and then credits you the difference on

342
00:10:20,301 --> 00:10:21,170
your next bill.

343
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:24,440
You can't say that that's
a non evil company.

344
00:10:24,441 --> 00:10:24,951
You can't,

345
00:10:24,951 --> 00:10:25,910
you can't argue with that.

346
00:10:26,090 --> 00:10:27,320
That's a good deal.

347
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:32,500
That sounds like a company that is
interested in selling you exactly what you

348
00:10:32,871 --> 00:10:37,871
need and are going to use as opposed
to locking you in some sort of stupid

349
00:10:39,501 --> 00:10:40,450
situation that you're,

350
00:10:40,460 --> 00:10:43,880
you're probably never going to fully
use and you're going to get stuck.

351
00:10:44,210 --> 00:10:45,140
You're going to get stuck there.

352
00:10:45,141 --> 00:10:45,881
And if you want to get out,

353
00:10:45,881 --> 00:10:46,714
you've got to pay.

354
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:47,270
Um,

355
00:10:47,270 --> 00:10:48,290
so we like him.

356
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:49,850
We like what they're doing.

357
00:10:49,851 --> 00:10:50,441
We liked the,

358
00:10:50,441 --> 00:10:51,240
the thought behind it.

359
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:55,380
And if you've got a rogan.ting.com and
save 25 bucks or go to that other dude

360
00:10:55,970 --> 00:10:56,803
say 50,

361
00:10:57,170 --> 00:10:58,040
if that's your shit,

362
00:10:58,250 --> 00:10:59,410
but just go get some tanks,

363
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:01,460
get some in your life about their opinion.

364
00:11:01,810 --> 00:11:03,170
Get some to take up any new hooker.

365
00:11:03,590 --> 00:11:03,770
Uh,

366
00:11:03,770 --> 00:11:06,150
we're also brought to you
by [inaudible] dot com um,

367
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:07,880
makers of the hemp force,

368
00:11:08,660 --> 00:11:12,950
a protein supplement
which is made out of uh,

369
00:11:13,070 --> 00:11:18,070
the highest protein hemp and it's
like really fucking intense stuff.

370
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:20,840
It's my favorite protein powder.

371
00:11:20,870 --> 00:11:22,160
It's all like,

372
00:11:22,430 --> 00:11:24,770
it's got raw cocoa in it.

373
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:26,330
It's gotten Maka in it,

374
00:11:26,930 --> 00:11:28,610
so it's got antioxidants in it.

375
00:11:28,611 --> 00:11:31,460
And Makkah is supposed to do something,

376
00:11:31,700 --> 00:11:36,370
something like a muscle building or the,

377
00:11:36,371 --> 00:11:38,930
the idea is that it increases
testosterone or something,

378
00:11:38,931 --> 00:11:40,580
I don't know at some fucking funky route,

379
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:43,370
but the combination of
them with the Stevia,

380
00:11:43,371 --> 00:11:44,450
it tastes fantastic.

381
00:11:44,910 --> 00:11:45,410
Um,

382
00:11:45,410 --> 00:11:48,530
for two days in a row I've been
drinking this upgraded coffee stuff.

383
00:11:48,910 --> 00:11:50,720
I decided I'm going to get off Starbucks.

384
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:52,550
Starbucks can socket.

385
00:11:52,930 --> 00:11:53,711
All right this,

386
00:11:53,711 --> 00:11:55,120
there's some funky coffee out there,

387
00:11:55,121 --> 00:11:55,660
man.

388
00:11:55,660 --> 00:11:57,160
If Dave Asprey's correct,

389
00:11:57,370 --> 00:11:58,360
if he's saying that,

390
00:11:58,390 --> 00:11:58,690
uh,

391
00:11:58,690 --> 00:12:01,620
all these coffees have toxic
mold on it and that's what a,

392
00:12:01,670 --> 00:12:05,890
it's slowly poisoning people and that
people were drinking mold that drinking

393
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:06,993
mold,

394
00:12:07,030 --> 00:12:09,190
mold t basically while,

395
00:12:09,191 --> 00:12:09,700
um,

396
00:12:09,700 --> 00:12:13,450
we started carrying this stuff
and on it called upgraded coffee.

397
00:12:13,510 --> 00:12:14,040
And a,

398
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:16,630
the idea behind it is
it's from a single source,

399
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:21,840
it's processed so that you know that it's
entirely mold free package sealed and

400
00:12:23,231 --> 00:12:24,400
then it gets to you.

401
00:12:24,401 --> 00:12:25,360
And when,

402
00:12:25,390 --> 00:12:28,390
when you get coffee that's from
like a single source like this,

403
00:12:28,391 --> 00:12:29,680
like real quality coffee.

404
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:31,390
It's really weird,

405
00:12:31,420 --> 00:12:36,420
but you don't get like nearly
as much of a crash when,

406
00:12:36,460 --> 00:12:37,930
when you're coming off of it.

407
00:12:38,290 --> 00:12:40,270
And I don't understand it.

408
00:12:40,330 --> 00:12:40,841
And uh,

409
00:12:40,841 --> 00:12:41,141
you know,

410
00:12:41,141 --> 00:12:43,900
Dave Asprey's version
of bulletproof coffee,

411
00:12:43,901 --> 00:12:44,800
we're drinking it right now.

412
00:12:44,801 --> 00:12:49,801
It's got a grass fed butter and MCT oil
and the coffee blended together as your

413
00:12:51,941 --> 00:12:52,920
shit's been oilier.

414
00:12:53,070 --> 00:12:58,070
They come both firing out
like logs on a river son boom.

415
00:12:58,870 --> 00:12:59,141
But,

416
00:12:59,141 --> 00:12:59,320
uh,

417
00:12:59,320 --> 00:12:59,741
his,

418
00:12:59,741 --> 00:13:00,130
um,

419
00:13:00,130 --> 00:13:01,360
his coffee is,

420
00:13:01,361 --> 00:13:01,790
uh,

421
00:13:01,790 --> 00:13:02,020
the,

422
00:13:02,020 --> 00:13:06,250
the combination of the MCT oil and the
grass fed butter with the coffee all

423
00:13:06,251 --> 00:13:07,210
blended together.

424
00:13:07,630 --> 00:13:08,171
It's crazy.

425
00:13:08,171 --> 00:13:08,890
Like you,

426
00:13:08,890 --> 00:13:11,830
it gives you energy for hours
and when it's over it's just,

427
00:13:11,831 --> 00:13:12,101
it's,

428
00:13:12,101 --> 00:13:14,260
it's much more mild,

429
00:13:14,470 --> 00:13:16,960
at least for me than other coffee,

430
00:13:16,961 --> 00:13:19,180
which leads to me to believe
that he might be right.

431
00:13:19,180 --> 00:13:19,960
I might've been,

432
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:24,960
I might've been drinking
fungus t I might've been
drinking some moldy ask beans.

433
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:27,310
And uh,

434
00:13:27,310 --> 00:13:29,740
according to that guy from
that dangerous grounds show,

435
00:13:29,741 --> 00:13:34,741
apparently a large percentage
of the coffee that we get
in this country has mold

436
00:13:34,841 --> 00:13:37,150
on it and that's fucking crazy.

437
00:13:37,630 --> 00:13:38,463
So um,

438
00:13:38,470 --> 00:13:41,470
so we immediately started carrying
that as soon as we heard about it.

439
00:13:41,650 --> 00:13:44,740
And that's the kind of shit that on
it is into doing anything that we,

440
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:46,390
we start caring.

441
00:13:46,540 --> 00:13:50,920
It's because either we use it and we
love it or we heard it's the best shit or

442
00:13:50,921 --> 00:13:52,240
it's what people have been requesting.

443
00:13:52,570 --> 00:13:54,250
Whether it's killer bee honey,

444
00:13:54,310 --> 00:13:56,410
nobody was requesting killer bee honey.

445
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:57,190
Okay.

446
00:13:57,190 --> 00:13:57,761
Nobody would,

447
00:13:57,761 --> 00:13:58,960
why would you want to kill her honey?

448
00:13:59,140 --> 00:14:04,140
Cause it's gangster as fuck to steal
some honey from some killer bees.

449
00:14:04,721 --> 00:14:05,590
I'm sorry.

450
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:08,080
Even if it doesn't taste as good,

451
00:14:08,100 --> 00:14:11,200
I am going to go with the
killer bee honey every time.

452
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:12,940
Cause I'm stupid like that.

453
00:14:13,370 --> 00:14:14,110
All right.

454
00:14:14,110 --> 00:14:16,000
And if you want some killer bee honey,

455
00:14:16,001 --> 00:14:17,050
we got that shit.

456
00:14:17,051 --> 00:14:19,330
This is real killer bee honey.

457
00:14:21,310 --> 00:14:22,143
It's a,

458
00:14:22,250 --> 00:14:23,170
I love it.

459
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:26,530
So that's the kind of shit that we
carry it on it from the hemp force.

460
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:29,290
Unfortunately we have
to buy it from Canada.

461
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:33,520
We have to buy all of our hemp protein
from Canada because cause people are

462
00:14:33,521 --> 00:14:34,354
crazy.

463
00:14:34,390 --> 00:14:39,390
And because hemp is the non-psychoactive
a version of the marijuana sativa

464
00:14:40,571 --> 00:14:41,330
plants.

465
00:14:41,330 --> 00:14:42,640
The hemp is the uh,

466
00:14:43,060 --> 00:14:43,490
the,

467
00:14:43,490 --> 00:14:43,830
you know,

468
00:14:43,830 --> 00:14:44,000
the,

469
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:48,000
the way it works is like you can call
them cousins or strains or now this has

470
00:14:48,010 --> 00:14:51,620
been a lot of argument and
anger online about nomenclature.

471
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:53,810
But the bottom line is that the,

472
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:54,740
the hemp,

473
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:55,481
when you,

474
00:14:55,481 --> 00:14:55,910
when you're,

475
00:14:55,910 --> 00:14:58,430
when you're getting him
in the hemp force protein,

476
00:14:58,431 --> 00:15:00,830
you're getting non psychoactive plants.

477
00:15:01,670 --> 00:15:05,750
The males are non
psychoactive and the females,

478
00:15:05,810 --> 00:15:06,320
uh,

479
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:07,430
the ones that you,

480
00:15:07,431 --> 00:15:07,700
uh,

481
00:15:07,700 --> 00:15:09,740
grow into a marijuana leaves,

482
00:15:09,741 --> 00:15:11,780
you have to like separate
them from the males,

483
00:15:12,100 --> 00:15:12,301
you know,

484
00:15:12,301 --> 00:15:14,480
keep the males from
getting an Achy in them.

485
00:15:14,940 --> 00:15:15,061
You know,

486
00:15:15,061 --> 00:15:16,550
you had the like breed together.

487
00:15:16,551 --> 00:15:17,540
The plants breed.

488
00:15:17,900 --> 00:15:19,010
It's fascinating shit,

489
00:15:19,011 --> 00:15:19,670
man.

490
00:15:19,670 --> 00:15:19,890
They're,

491
00:15:19,890 --> 00:15:20,310
they're,

492
00:15:20,310 --> 00:15:24,980
they're literally like a sexual
plant while the hemp that we get,

493
00:15:24,981 --> 00:15:26,210
we have to get in Canada,

494
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:27,830
so we can't even have a farm.

495
00:15:27,831 --> 00:15:30,140
We can't even grow the
non psychoactive version.

496
00:15:30,141 --> 00:15:31,040
Like you can come check,

497
00:15:31,041 --> 00:15:32,150
make sure it's the right stuff.

498
00:15:32,420 --> 00:15:33,350
You can't even grow that.

499
00:15:33,590 --> 00:15:33,921
They,

500
00:15:33,921 --> 00:15:34,210
they,

501
00:15:34,210 --> 00:15:34,660
they do.

502
00:15:34,660 --> 00:15:38,510
They do not want Americans
even growing it for,

503
00:15:38,540 --> 00:15:39,020
uh,

504
00:15:39,020 --> 00:15:42,350
for use as textiles or as a commodity.

505
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:44,810
They don't want it
introduced into the market.

506
00:15:45,100 --> 00:15:48,020
It's an incredibly powerful resource.

507
00:15:48,770 --> 00:15:50,960
It's one of the greatest plants on earth.

508
00:15:50,990 --> 00:15:51,201
I mean,

509
00:15:51,201 --> 00:15:53,330
it really is an amazing product.

510
00:15:53,331 --> 00:15:56,930
If you stop and think about all the
different things that hemp does,

511
00:15:57,230 --> 00:15:59,450
it really would blow your fucking mind.

512
00:15:59,451 --> 00:16:00,680
And it's kind of a Hippie,

513
00:16:00,681 --> 00:16:01,580
explosion,

514
00:16:01,581 --> 00:16:04,250
drowning type situation
because we've all said,

515
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:06,350
we've heard people talk
about it so many times,

516
00:16:06,351 --> 00:16:08,270
like especially hippies
that just like you,

517
00:16:08,271 --> 00:16:11,780
June Newman and hemp has been
noonish to shrink tumors.

518
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:12,171
Did,

519
00:16:12,171 --> 00:16:15,590
you knew that you can make your clothes
ahead of him and after a while he just

520
00:16:15,591 --> 00:16:15,861
want to go,

521
00:16:15,861 --> 00:16:16,251
okay,

522
00:16:16,251 --> 00:16:16,910
okay,

523
00:16:16,910 --> 00:16:17,900
you're annoying.

524
00:16:17,901 --> 00:16:19,820
So I think Hampson knowing too,

525
00:16:19,850 --> 00:16:23,810
I'm listening to you and I'm getting
crazy noise and I'm assuming that hemp

526
00:16:23,811 --> 00:16:25,640
socks cause you suck,

527
00:16:27,020 --> 00:16:29,180
well does not suck folks.

528
00:16:29,810 --> 00:16:31,970
It is a craziest plant on earth.

529
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:36,710
You can make the finest paper out of
it far stronger than paper that we have

530
00:16:36,711 --> 00:16:37,790
that's made out of trees.

531
00:16:38,060 --> 00:16:40,070
You can make food out of it,

532
00:16:40,071 --> 00:16:40,881
you can eat it.

533
00:16:40,881 --> 00:16:42,920
It has essential amino acids in it.

534
00:16:43,220 --> 00:16:44,360
It has protein.

535
00:16:44,660 --> 00:16:48,140
You can make clothes out of it
far superior to cotton clothes.

536
00:16:48,290 --> 00:16:52,430
You can turn it into fucking
heating oil to power the lamps,

537
00:16:52,431 --> 00:16:52,661
these,

538
00:16:52,661 --> 00:16:54,530
these hemp oil lamps.

539
00:16:54,860 --> 00:16:59,480
You can take the oil and you put it on
your food and it makes your food far more

540
00:16:59,510 --> 00:17:00,650
nutritious.

541
00:17:00,980 --> 00:17:02,780
It's a crazy plants.

542
00:17:03,050 --> 00:17:04,040
If you juice it,

543
00:17:04,041 --> 00:17:05,090
you extract the juice.

544
00:17:05,091 --> 00:17:06,470
Apparently it's super healthy,

545
00:17:06,471 --> 00:17:09,710
like way healthier than wheat
grass juice and it's illegal.

546
00:17:11,060 --> 00:17:16,060
We're so fucking stupid when it
comes to this that it hurts my brain.

547
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:22,640
But at least we can sell you
hemp force grown in Canada.

548
00:17:23,630 --> 00:17:27,560
And not that I don't love given Canadians
work cause I love me some Canadians.

549
00:17:27,950 --> 00:17:28,860
But that's bullshit.

550
00:17:28,861 --> 00:17:29,694
It's on.

551
00:17:30,470 --> 00:17:31,070
All right.

552
00:17:31,070 --> 00:17:31,903
And with that said,

553
00:17:32,010 --> 00:17:36,230
use the code neighbor Brogan and you will
save 10% off any and all supplements,

554
00:17:36,380 --> 00:17:36,701
uh,

555
00:17:36,701 --> 00:17:37,070
that,

556
00:17:37,070 --> 00:17:41,270
that code does not apply to kettle
bells and battle ropes and all that shit

557
00:17:41,510 --> 00:17:42,171
because a,

558
00:17:42,171 --> 00:17:47,171
all that fitness equipment stuff is super
hard to ship and very hard to carry.

559
00:17:47,631 --> 00:17:47,891
Like we,

560
00:17:47,891 --> 00:17:50,030
we were sending these iron

561
00:17:50,030 --> 00:17:51,380
balls in the mail.

562
00:17:51,450 --> 00:17:51,620
Okay.

563
00:17:51,620 --> 00:17:51,971
It's a,

564
00:17:51,971 --> 00:17:54,140
it's a huge pain that Dick.

565
00:17:54,590 --> 00:17:55,423
So the uh,

566
00:17:55,450 --> 00:17:55,700
the,

567
00:17:55,700 --> 00:17:59,540
the discounts on that do not apply because
we're trying to sell them to you as

568
00:17:59,750 --> 00:18:01,370
cheaply as we possibly can.

569
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:03,500
The battle ropes are the cheapest.

570
00:18:03,501 --> 00:18:04,940
You can find that the highest quality,

571
00:18:04,941 --> 00:18:06,380
like ship yard ropes.

572
00:18:06,820 --> 00:18:07,760
You ever work out with us?

573
00:18:07,761 --> 00:18:08,040
Dude?

574
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:09,200
You ever do battle rope workouts?

575
00:18:10,010 --> 00:18:10,843
So fun.

576
00:18:11,300 --> 00:18:11,801
It's fun.

577
00:18:11,801 --> 00:18:12,401
It's savage.

578
00:18:12,401 --> 00:18:14,840
Re you feel like you're
like Conan or something.

579
00:18:15,820 --> 00:18:16,360
Uh,

580
00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:16,990
anyway,

581
00:18:16,990 --> 00:18:17,411
that's it.

582
00:18:17,411 --> 00:18:18,040
Use a code name,

583
00:18:18,040 --> 00:18:18,470
Rogan,

584
00:18:18,470 --> 00:18:21,530
10% off any supplements
and a and that's it.

585
00:18:21,531 --> 00:18:21,621
You,

586
00:18:21,621 --> 00:18:22,280
Fox,

587
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:24,100
Adam Hunter is here and we're going to,

588
00:18:24,230 --> 00:18:25,520
we're fixing to get busy.

589
00:18:29,620 --> 00:18:34,620
[inaudible] Adam,

590
00:18:38,490 --> 00:18:40,320
welcome to the podcast,

591
00:18:40,321 --> 00:18:40,740
sir.

592
00:18:40,740 --> 00:18:41,573
It's good to be here.

593
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:42,880
Be here with you as well.

594
00:18:42,881 --> 00:18:45,280
My friends and Brian Redman always.

595
00:18:46,210 --> 00:18:46,781
What's up buddy?

596
00:18:46,781 --> 00:18:47,270
How are you?

597
00:18:47,270 --> 00:18:48,110
I'm doing great man.

598
00:18:48,111 --> 00:18:48,770
This is like,

599
00:18:48,770 --> 00:18:50,060
what are the highlights
of my whole career?

600
00:18:50,450 --> 00:18:51,283
Not even kidding.

601
00:18:51,560 --> 00:18:52,400
That's ridiculous,

602
00:18:52,401 --> 00:18:53,001
but thank you.

603
00:18:53,001 --> 00:18:54,950
I'm honored and it's ridiculous.

604
00:18:54,951 --> 00:18:55,784
At the same time,

605
00:18:56,900 --> 00:18:57,501
Adam was,

606
00:18:57,501 --> 00:18:58,334
um,

607
00:18:58,460 --> 00:18:59,180
uh,

608
00:18:59,180 --> 00:18:59,781
really funny,

609
00:18:59,781 --> 00:19:01,290
standup comedian and a,

610
00:19:01,291 --> 00:19:04,670
a big MMA fan and he said
something really funny,

611
00:19:04,940 --> 00:19:05,600
uh,

612
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:06,470
on Twitter.

613
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:07,431
You said it on Twitter,

614
00:19:07,431 --> 00:19:08,264
right?

615
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:09,040
And,

616
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:09,710
uh,

617
00:19:09,710 --> 00:19:10,110
and I,

618
00:19:10,110 --> 00:19:11,600
I read it on a,

619
00:19:11,610 --> 00:19:14,330
on the air and a god and a bit of trouble.

620
00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:15,751
I said that,

621
00:19:15,751 --> 00:19:16,584
uh,

622
00:19:17,810 --> 00:19:18,500
you want to say it?

623
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:21,490
She said that Martin Kampmann comes
from behind more than Lance Bass.

624
00:19:21,750 --> 00:19:22,583
Yes.

625
00:19:23,570 --> 00:19:24,170
I said,

626
00:19:24,170 --> 00:19:25,003
I said,

627
00:19:25,130 --> 00:19:25,371
you know,

628
00:19:25,371 --> 00:19:26,780
this is a distasteful jokes.

629
00:19:26,810 --> 00:19:27,740
And then I said it anyway.

630
00:19:27,950 --> 00:19:28,101
No,

631
00:19:28,101 --> 00:19:28,521
it was great.

632
00:19:28,521 --> 00:19:29,390
You gave me credit for it.

633
00:19:29,391 --> 00:19:34,391
And there was a moment of just awkwardness
Kohlberg over and looked at you.

634
00:19:34,670 --> 00:19:35,420
And he's like,

635
00:19:35,420 --> 00:19:37,430
and it was the greatest
talking television dude.

636
00:19:37,430 --> 00:19:38,130
I was on a crew.

637
00:19:38,130 --> 00:19:38,901
I'm on a cruise.

638
00:19:38,901 --> 00:19:39,110
I don't,

639
00:19:39,110 --> 00:19:39,680
don't get Internet,

640
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:40,461
can't watch the fights,

641
00:19:40,461 --> 00:19:41,151
I'm depressed.

642
00:19:41,151 --> 00:19:42,110
I'm like working on a ship.

643
00:19:42,111 --> 00:19:42,471
They can't.

644
00:19:42,471 --> 00:19:43,304
I'm trying.

645
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:44,233
I can't get nothing,

646
00:19:44,360 --> 00:19:45,171
no TVS.

647
00:19:45,171 --> 00:19:46,310
And then all of a sudden I get a text,

648
00:19:46,311 --> 00:19:46,980
my phone was on,

649
00:19:46,980 --> 00:19:47,480
it was like,

650
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:47,721
dude,

651
00:19:47,721 --> 00:19:49,250
Rogan's blew you up on Twitter,

652
00:19:50,120 --> 00:19:51,890
do roving to see a come from behind joke.

653
00:19:51,891 --> 00:19:52,724
And I'm like,

654
00:19:53,030 --> 00:19:54,170
I don't know who won the fight.

655
00:19:54,171 --> 00:19:56,840
And now I'm like looking.

656
00:19:57,050 --> 00:19:57,321
I'm like,

657
00:19:57,321 --> 00:19:58,070
Dude.

658
00:19:58,070 --> 00:19:58,311
I'm like,

659
00:19:58,311 --> 00:19:59,121
thank you bro.

660
00:19:59,121 --> 00:20:00,500
You don't have no idea
how much that meant.

661
00:20:00,501 --> 00:20:01,580
It was fucking awesome.

662
00:20:01,581 --> 00:20:03,260
People said to me that that's like,

663
00:20:03,290 --> 00:20:05,750
oh well like I've heard
criticism like total,

664
00:20:05,820 --> 00:20:07,130
even though for the Turkey,

665
00:20:07,180 --> 00:20:08,510
that is hilarious.

666
00:20:08,900 --> 00:20:12,710
If you know who Martin Kampmann is and
you know like Martin Kampmann has had

667
00:20:12,711 --> 00:20:14,900
some amazing come from behind victories,

668
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:17,930
so to say that he comes from
behind more than Lance Bass.

669
00:20:18,290 --> 00:20:20,060
I thought that was so funny,

670
00:20:20,061 --> 00:20:20,540
man.

671
00:20:20,540 --> 00:20:20,721
Oh,

672
00:20:20,721 --> 00:20:21,554
thank you.

673
00:20:21,710 --> 00:20:23,690
I probably shouldn't
have said it on the air.

674
00:20:24,150 --> 00:20:25,070
It was DePaul,

675
00:20:25,071 --> 00:20:25,611
first of all,

676
00:20:25,611 --> 00:20:25,941
Sam,

677
00:20:25,941 --> 00:20:28,040
sons of anarchy on the
air and that network.

678
00:20:28,041 --> 00:20:28,980
I mean this is the show.

679
00:20:29,010 --> 00:20:29,900
This is will.

680
00:20:30,030 --> 00:20:31,190
People are silly.

681
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:31,850
I mean,

682
00:20:31,850 --> 00:20:33,050
I don't think they care.

683
00:20:33,080 --> 00:20:33,980
It's just a joke.

684
00:20:33,981 --> 00:20:34,880
And if you do care,

685
00:20:34,881 --> 00:20:35,361
come on,

686
00:20:35,361 --> 00:20:40,361
you just watched a guy get his fucking
face beaten in any better get to Anderson

687
00:20:40,580 --> 00:20:40,640
Cooper,

688
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:41,330
it would have been just,

689
00:20:41,330 --> 00:20:41,990
you know,

690
00:20:41,990 --> 00:20:42,750
yeah,

691
00:20:42,750 --> 00:20:43,730
that would have probably been better,

692
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:46,070
but I don't even understand
what via what the,

693
00:20:46,630 --> 00:20:47,800
the would even better.

694
00:20:48,270 --> 00:20:51,160
A little bit better because it feels
like you're picking on Lance Bass,

695
00:20:51,340 --> 00:20:53,630
whereas Anderson Cooper feels
like he can defend himself.

696
00:20:54,070 --> 00:20:55,040
People I want to know,

697
00:20:55,060 --> 00:20:56,080
I went on one of those like,

698
00:20:56,110 --> 00:20:56,171
uh,

699
00:20:56,171 --> 00:20:57,200
forums and uh,

700
00:20:57,290 --> 00:20:58,180
I know underground,

701
00:20:58,181 --> 00:20:58,450
right?

702
00:20:58,450 --> 00:21:00,340
And people had like pictures of lands,

703
00:21:00,341 --> 00:21:02,770
Bass and that says we got your back Bro.

704
00:21:06,170 --> 00:21:06,611
I was like,

705
00:21:06,611 --> 00:21:06,791
dude,

706
00:21:06,791 --> 00:21:08,260
that is the funniest fucking thing.

707
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:11,410
And then people were
arguing for like 30 pages,

708
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:14,470
30 pages of threads back and
forth on why someone was like,

709
00:21:14,471 --> 00:21:15,610
the only thing is offensive,

710
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:15,880
uh,

711
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:16,031
as,

712
00:21:16,031 --> 00:21:17,920
as a gay man is that lance bass,

713
00:21:17,921 --> 00:21:19,420
assuming that he comes from behind it,

714
00:21:19,421 --> 00:21:20,470
that guy's a a bottom.

715
00:21:20,620 --> 00:21:21,453
Like people were like,

716
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:23,681
well,

717
00:21:23,681 --> 00:21:24,790
it's not offensive.

718
00:21:24,820 --> 00:21:25,420
It's not,

719
00:21:25,420 --> 00:21:25,661
I mean,

720
00:21:25,661 --> 00:21:26,680
what is wrong with coming?

721
00:21:26,690 --> 00:21:27,850
It doesn't everybody want to come?

722
00:21:29,050 --> 00:21:30,130
People are having sex.

723
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:30,341
Well,

724
00:21:30,341 --> 00:21:33,060
they just want to just like try
it real quick and then stop dude.

725
00:21:33,080 --> 00:21:34,090
And then someone wrote,

726
00:21:34,091 --> 00:21:35,530
this is how the Holocaust started

727
00:21:39,690 --> 00:21:40,523
trolling.

728
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:42,450
It's like what do people,

729
00:21:42,780 --> 00:21:43,613
but I was like,

730
00:21:43,870 --> 00:21:45,010
it was unbelievable.

731
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:47,950
I was like joke to everybody.

732
00:21:47,980 --> 00:21:49,080
I tell everybody that choke.

733
00:21:49,090 --> 00:21:50,920
It's a funny fucking joke man did.

734
00:21:50,950 --> 00:21:55,540
And it's funny cause I started the MMA
roasted like about a year ago and like

735
00:21:55,541 --> 00:21:56,231
literally Mike,

736
00:21:56,231 --> 00:22:00,790
my page has like 5,000 followers and
then they roast it has 18 six six 17,000

737
00:22:00,791 --> 00:22:01,330
followers.

738
00:22:01,330 --> 00:22:03,550
Like they blew up because
people just are like,

739
00:22:03,790 --> 00:22:04,780
people seem to love it.

740
00:22:04,810 --> 00:22:05,081
You know,

741
00:22:05,081 --> 00:22:07,420
cause they've tried to do it in a way
where it's not disrespectful but you're

742
00:22:07,421 --> 00:22:08,530
still making someone laugh.

743
00:22:08,650 --> 00:22:08,951
Yeah.

744
00:22:08,951 --> 00:22:10,330
You will walk a fine line.

745
00:22:10,510 --> 00:22:12,040
You're making fun of trained killers.

746
00:22:12,130 --> 00:22:13,210
I know that's your Twitter,

747
00:22:13,211 --> 00:22:15,820
your Twitter page off
goofing on trained killers.

748
00:22:16,090 --> 00:22:16,923
Absolutely.

749
00:22:17,260 --> 00:22:17,910
But like,

750
00:22:17,910 --> 00:22:19,930
but they need to laugh too
cause like if everyone,

751
00:22:19,990 --> 00:22:20,410
you know,

752
00:22:20,410 --> 00:22:21,290
why should they speak,

753
00:22:21,490 --> 00:22:23,770
you know like at me when
you make fun of someone,

754
00:22:23,850 --> 00:22:24,280
right.

755
00:22:24,280 --> 00:22:26,230
I'm trying to do in a way where
it's like I'm roasting them.

756
00:22:26,231 --> 00:22:26,381
Like,

757
00:22:26,381 --> 00:22:29,650
obviously respect that person and
it's trying to make you laugh too.

758
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:30,270
You know,

759
00:22:30,270 --> 00:22:33,950
dude fucking pages of Shit that
you showed me that you have.

760
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:38,080
Like I have 50 pages of jokes
about each frame and like,

761
00:22:38,110 --> 00:22:38,750
but it's like,

762
00:22:38,750 --> 00:22:40,420
it's cool that I saw them.

763
00:22:40,421 --> 00:22:41,201
It's ridiculous.

764
00:22:41,201 --> 00:22:42,700
You have so many and the really good ones,

765
00:22:42,701 --> 00:22:42,941
man,

766
00:22:42,941 --> 00:22:44,000
you've got a bunch of really good ones.

767
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:44,910
Thanks man.

768
00:22:44,910 --> 00:22:46,450
I'm one of my favorite one was that,

769
00:22:46,690 --> 00:22:50,320
well Steven Seagal said he wants to
fight Randy couture but no witnesses just

770
00:22:50,321 --> 00:22:51,400
like his last 20 films.

771
00:22:53,890 --> 00:22:54,480
It was like,

772
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:56,170
I then I like bright one of them.

773
00:22:56,171 --> 00:22:57,004
I wrote uh,

774
00:22:57,150 --> 00:22:57,481
one of them,

775
00:22:57,481 --> 00:22:58,000
I'm like,

776
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,490
cause I'll write something and all
of a sudden they'll get 800 retweets.

777
00:23:00,491 --> 00:23:01,300
And I'm like,

778
00:23:01,300 --> 00:23:04,270
like the only person who gets screwed up
from Jersey more than Frankie Edgar is

779
00:23:04,271 --> 00:23:05,104
a sneaky,

780
00:23:05,550 --> 00:23:06,383
like just,

781
00:23:06,460 --> 00:23:07,420
and then people will just be like,

782
00:23:07,421 --> 00:23:07,601
blah,

783
00:23:07,601 --> 00:23:08,400
blah blah.

784
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:08,651
I'm like,

785
00:23:08,651 --> 00:23:09,311
Holy Shit.

786
00:23:09,311 --> 00:23:10,270
It became this fucking,

787
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:12,100
like the other night I wrote,

788
00:23:12,250 --> 00:23:12,850
if I'm,

789
00:23:12,850 --> 00:23:15,610
if I leave any fighters out
and you want me to roast you,

790
00:23:15,611 --> 00:23:16,300
please do.

791
00:23:16,300 --> 00:23:17,800
And all of a sudden all these fighters,

792
00:23:17,830 --> 00:23:18,551
John Dodson,

793
00:23:18,551 --> 00:23:19,181
it's like roast me,

794
00:23:19,181 --> 00:23:19,451
man.

795
00:23:19,451 --> 00:23:19,961
I'm short.

796
00:23:19,961 --> 00:23:20,380
Well,

797
00:23:20,380 --> 00:23:21,520
and then Mike piles like,

798
00:23:21,580 --> 00:23:23,010
what am I too good to
be fucking roasted it?

799
00:23:23,060 --> 00:23:24,550
Like all these pros were like,

800
00:23:24,551 --> 00:23:24,791
I was like,

801
00:23:24,791 --> 00:23:25,624
Holy Shit.

802
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:28,910
And then like 50 people started
roasting those people as well.

803
00:23:28,930 --> 00:23:29,061
The,

804
00:23:29,061 --> 00:23:30,610
a lot of guys have a sense of humor,

805
00:23:30,980 --> 00:23:31,813
you know,

806
00:23:31,870 --> 00:23:32,681
for the most part,

807
00:23:32,681 --> 00:23:34,570
like Mike Pyle is a great sense of humor.

808
00:23:34,930 --> 00:23:35,830
I think that it's,

809
00:23:35,831 --> 00:23:36,310
uh,

810
00:23:36,310 --> 00:23:36,731
you know,

811
00:23:36,731 --> 00:23:37,660
for some dudes though,

812
00:23:37,661 --> 00:23:37,901
they're like,

813
00:23:37,901 --> 00:23:38,920
who the fuck is this guy?

814
00:23:38,921 --> 00:23:40,540
Man Wants to talk to shit on me.

815
00:23:40,630 --> 00:23:41,860
I do get a little nervous.

816
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:44,193
I'm not gonna,

817
00:23:44,230 --> 00:23:45,060
I'm not gonna lie.

818
00:23:45,060 --> 00:23:46,020
I get a little nervous when

819
00:23:46,020 --> 00:23:47,100
you goof on people,

820
00:23:47,101 --> 00:23:47,371
man,

821
00:23:47,371 --> 00:23:48,121
they get mad.

822
00:23:48,121 --> 00:23:49,430
They don't like it yet.

823
00:23:49,470 --> 00:23:49,741
Well,

824
00:23:49,741 --> 00:23:50,010
some,

825
00:23:50,010 --> 00:23:50,731
some you get mad,

826
00:23:50,731 --> 00:23:51,061
but you know,

827
00:23:51,061 --> 00:23:52,830
I tried to do it in a way
where it's like respectful.

828
00:23:52,840 --> 00:23:54,540
I don't mean to hurt anybody's feelings,

829
00:23:54,541 --> 00:23:55,000
you know?

830
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:55,620
Yeah.

831
00:23:55,620 --> 00:23:57,630
At the same time I tried to
do it in a way where like,

832
00:23:57,631 --> 00:23:58,350
uh,

833
00:23:58,350 --> 00:23:58,651
you know,

834
00:23:58,651 --> 00:23:59,310
like,

835
00:23:59,310 --> 00:23:59,521
hey,

836
00:23:59,521 --> 00:24:00,270
we're just,

837
00:24:00,270 --> 00:24:00,541
I don't know.

838
00:24:00,541 --> 00:24:01,380
I'm trying to them laugh,

839
00:24:01,410 --> 00:24:02,243
you know,

840
00:24:02,250 --> 00:24:02,640
it's,

841
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:03,450
it's hard though.

842
00:24:03,450 --> 00:24:06,900
It's like someone's following me and
then they lose and I want to make a joke

843
00:24:06,930 --> 00:24:07,380
and I'm like,

844
00:24:07,380 --> 00:24:08,071
aw shit,

845
00:24:08,071 --> 00:24:08,940
I don't want them to see it.

846
00:24:08,941 --> 00:24:09,774
I'm just like,

847
00:24:11,430 --> 00:24:12,370
like what would you do?

848
00:24:12,371 --> 00:24:13,650
A frank Trigg was in the room.

849
00:24:14,010 --> 00:24:15,060
Would you tell that the,

850
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:16,110
the Frank Trigg joke,

851
00:24:16,170 --> 00:24:16,291
oh,

852
00:24:16,291 --> 00:24:17,970
Frederick came to my show actually.

853
00:24:18,020 --> 00:24:18,510
I don't know.

854
00:24:18,510 --> 00:24:20,220
I think he started following
me after those jokes.

855
00:24:22,980 --> 00:24:23,370
Yeah.

856
00:24:23,370 --> 00:24:24,450
I said no,

857
00:24:24,540 --> 00:24:25,470
but what would I tell it to?

858
00:24:25,471 --> 00:24:25,951
I'm probably,

859
00:24:25,951 --> 00:24:26,910
I probably show it to them.

860
00:24:26,970 --> 00:24:27,803
I wouldn't know.

861
00:24:28,310 --> 00:24:31,740
I would try to gauge his reaction now
whether or not he's laughing or not.

862
00:24:32,160 --> 00:24:33,840
And then base my reaction on it.

863
00:24:33,841 --> 00:24:34,531
What he's going to go.

864
00:24:34,531 --> 00:24:35,230
People are like what?

865
00:24:35,230 --> 00:24:37,260
We talked about the jug before the show.

866
00:24:37,710 --> 00:24:37,921
Oh,

867
00:24:37,921 --> 00:24:39,100
about what is told.

868
00:24:39,340 --> 00:24:39,841
I don't even know.

869
00:24:39,841 --> 00:24:40,171
I said,

870
00:24:40,171 --> 00:24:40,880
I said frank,

871
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:41,340
uh,

872
00:24:41,340 --> 00:24:42,600
frank Trigg beat his wife so bad.

873
00:24:42,601 --> 00:24:43,620
The Bob Sapp topped out.

874
00:24:46,260 --> 00:24:51,060
And then I started making fun of SAP
and SAP started following me and then

875
00:24:51,061 --> 00:24:53,880
followers started making it and I felt
bad cause followers or making fun of them

876
00:24:53,881 --> 00:24:54,630
and I was like,

877
00:24:54,630 --> 00:24:56,880
so then I started defending
him and then Bob cycles,

878
00:24:56,910 --> 00:24:57,661
it's all cool.

879
00:24:57,661 --> 00:24:59,100
It's like whenever we all toast,

880
00:24:59,101 --> 00:25:00,080
when we rose Bob Saps,

881
00:25:00,110 --> 00:25:00,690
I'm like,

882
00:25:00,690 --> 00:25:01,070
great.

883
00:25:01,070 --> 00:25:01,770
Wow.

884
00:25:01,770 --> 00:25:05,760
Bob Sapp at one point in time was one
of the scariest human beings on earth.

885
00:25:06,330 --> 00:25:11,330
There was a run that he had when he beat
or Nesto who's twice did he beat her?

886
00:25:11,461 --> 00:25:12,590
Nesto fucking,

887
00:25:12,591 --> 00:25:12,810
yeah.

888
00:25:12,810 --> 00:25:15,300
Who at the time was like kickboxing man.

889
00:25:15,340 --> 00:25:16,173
Yeah.

890
00:25:16,470 --> 00:25:18,090
That was craziness.

891
00:25:18,091 --> 00:25:20,130
And he did it just with power.

892
00:25:20,450 --> 00:25:22,800
Just sheer hulk strength.

893
00:25:23,050 --> 00:25:23,291
Yeah.

894
00:25:23,291 --> 00:25:23,530
No,

895
00:25:23,530 --> 00:25:24,363
Bob Sapp was,

896
00:25:24,550 --> 00:25:25,510
it was a beast.

897
00:25:25,511 --> 00:25:26,680
I mean like his nickname too.

898
00:25:26,730 --> 00:25:27,050
Yeah,

899
00:25:27,050 --> 00:25:27,883
that one.

900
00:25:27,980 --> 00:25:29,720
There's two fights that he had.

901
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:30,920
Have you ever seen these,

902
00:25:30,921 --> 00:25:31,610
Brian?

903
00:25:31,610 --> 00:25:32,443
Have you ever seen it?

904
00:25:32,450 --> 00:25:34,130
You should pull these up.

905
00:25:34,520 --> 00:25:39,520
Bob Sapp versus Ernesto hoost because
if people haven't seen this fight,

906
00:25:39,710 --> 00:25:44,300
you really don't understand how big Bob
Sapp was because he doesn't even look

907
00:25:44,301 --> 00:25:45,230
like a real human.

908
00:25:45,260 --> 00:25:46,520
He doesn't look real.

909
00:25:46,550 --> 00:25:46,721
Yeah,

910
00:25:46,721 --> 00:25:46,950
no,

911
00:25:46,950 --> 00:25:49,400
it's like some CGI upset versus who?

912
00:25:50,120 --> 00:25:51,170
Ernesto hoost.

913
00:25:51,230 --> 00:25:52,430
She's a huge star in Japan.

914
00:25:52,431 --> 00:25:52,850
After that.

915
00:25:52,850 --> 00:25:54,380
I mean he was Ernesto hoost.

916
00:25:54,440 --> 00:25:55,520
Is Mr Perfect.

917
00:25:55,580 --> 00:25:57,560
One of the greatest
kickboxers of all time.

918
00:25:57,610 --> 00:25:57,950
Yeah,

919
00:25:57,950 --> 00:25:59,720
and he was like incredibly,

920
00:25:59,721 --> 00:26:03,860
incredibly technical and it would just
chop chop away at you would leg kicks and

921
00:26:04,010 --> 00:26:05,570
knock dudes out with head kicks,

922
00:26:05,571 --> 00:26:08,120
like set you up with leg kicks and
it take you out with a head kick.

923
00:26:08,330 --> 00:26:12,140
Very technical like Dutch
Moy Tai and Bob Sapp.

924
00:26:12,141 --> 00:26:13,490
Just bum rushed him,

925
00:26:13,491 --> 00:26:14,120
man.

926
00:26:14,120 --> 00:26:17,270
Just 370 pounds with ABS.

927
00:26:17,300 --> 00:26:17,780
Look at him.

928
00:26:17,780 --> 00:26:18,770
Look at this video.

929
00:26:19,830 --> 00:26:21,450
Look at the size of him.

930
00:26:22,170 --> 00:26:24,660
Jesus fucking Christ.

931
00:26:24,840 --> 00:26:28,710
That's a human look at
the size of Bob Sapp.

932
00:26:28,740 --> 00:26:29,910
When he was in his prime,

933
00:26:30,180 --> 00:26:31,470
he was gigantic.

934
00:26:31,471 --> 00:26:32,850
He was a character in a movie.

935
00:26:32,851 --> 00:26:33,240
Look,

936
00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:37,140
he's getting kicked and he's
just fucking moving forward,

937
00:26:37,141 --> 00:26:38,280
wailing on him.

938
00:26:39,450 --> 00:26:44,450
You're talking about a guy who's just
started kickboxing like a year ago and

939
00:26:44,671 --> 00:26:48,330
he's in there with Ernesto hoost
and look at how he's punching.

940
00:26:48,580 --> 00:26:48,790
Look,

941
00:26:48,790 --> 00:26:52,560
he's no technique or heart and muscle.

942
00:26:52,950 --> 00:26:53,910
Just giant.

943
00:26:54,060 --> 00:26:55,290
Can't die.

944
00:26:55,560 --> 00:26:57,780
Look at the fucking size of them.

945
00:26:57,810 --> 00:26:58,051
Yeah.

946
00:26:58,051 --> 00:26:58,884
He's a legend.

947
00:27:00,190 --> 00:27:02,770
And looking at Nesta who's just
chopping away at those legs,

948
00:27:02,771 --> 00:27:06,310
trying to take them out and
SAP keeps moving forward,

949
00:27:07,550 --> 00:27:08,650
trying to check his legs.

950
00:27:08,651 --> 00:27:10,900
He can't even lift his legs
up there so fucking big.

951
00:27:11,010 --> 00:27:11,843
Hmm.

952
00:27:15,750 --> 00:27:19,510
And so slowly starting to
get homes tagging him here.

953
00:27:21,300 --> 00:27:23,710
Bob Sapp is still moving forward.

954
00:27:24,700 --> 00:27:26,770
I don't care how much
muscle you have on you,

955
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:27,401
Ernesto.

956
00:27:27,401 --> 00:27:28,990
Who's this teen off on your face,

957
00:27:28,991 --> 00:27:29,590
son.

958
00:27:29,590 --> 00:27:30,191
Boom.

959
00:27:30,191 --> 00:27:31,270
Big Leg kick.

960
00:27:32,650 --> 00:27:33,730
Anesto oh,

961
00:27:33,750 --> 00:27:37,010
we dropped some of the
left left to the body.

962
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:39,260
Look at the technique.

963
00:27:39,320 --> 00:27:41,270
Beautiful left hook to the body.

964
00:27:41,390 --> 00:27:42,111
Now you gotta think,

965
00:27:42,111 --> 00:27:45,110
how the fuck does Bob Sapp win this fight?

966
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:48,080
How the fuck does Bob Sapp
get up and win this fight?

967
00:27:48,260 --> 00:27:49,093
He playing it.

968
00:27:49,670 --> 00:27:50,570
Watch this shit.

969
00:27:50,840 --> 00:27:51,890
It's like a 10 minute video.

970
00:27:51,950 --> 00:27:52,850
Watch this shit though.

971
00:27:52,851 --> 00:27:54,140
This is where it gets crazy.

972
00:27:56,470 --> 00:27:56,981
Ernesto,

973
00:27:56,981 --> 00:27:59,270
who's his fucking crushing him here?

974
00:28:04,620 --> 00:28:09,480
And Bob Sapp starts moving forward again
and he's holding on to one with one

975
00:28:09,481 --> 00:28:11,280
hand and throws him to the ground.

976
00:28:11,281 --> 00:28:11,570
I mean,

977
00:28:11,570 --> 00:28:13,560
this is fight is insane.

978
00:28:13,890 --> 00:28:18,890
This dude just got dropped by vicious
left hooks to the body just a few seconds

979
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:19,793
ago.

980
00:28:23,980 --> 00:28:28,980
If you wanted this look at like a guy
who would be like a genetic experiments.

981
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:33,970
How bad can a guy get and
still fuck other dudes up?

982
00:28:34,180 --> 00:28:36,670
You can say Bob Sapp right here,

983
00:28:37,870 --> 00:28:39,340
but it's not for very long.

984
00:28:39,370 --> 00:28:41,200
You can only do this
for a couple of years.

985
00:28:42,140 --> 00:28:42,500
Yeah,

986
00:28:42,500 --> 00:28:42,811
look,

987
00:28:42,811 --> 00:28:44,580
he's eaten those leg kicks,

988
00:28:44,581 --> 00:28:44,941
man.

989
00:28:44,941 --> 00:28:45,361
You've got to go.

990
00:28:45,361 --> 00:28:48,300
How the fuck is he still there?

991
00:28:48,440 --> 00:28:49,273
Yeah,

992
00:28:49,530 --> 00:28:50,363
that's insane.

993
00:28:50,370 --> 00:28:52,530
Danny gets hit with that
left hook to the body.

994
00:28:55,830 --> 00:28:56,790
Jesus Christ.

995
00:28:56,791 --> 00:28:57,211
Ernesto,

996
00:28:57,211 --> 00:29:02,211
who was just hit him with like 10
unanswered clean shots to his head and Bob

997
00:29:02,490 --> 00:29:03,990
Sapp is still there.

998
00:29:08,990 --> 00:29:10,500
He's even thinking about kicking him.

999
00:29:13,450 --> 00:29:16,930
Just go to the end of the fight so we
can watch the end of it because in the

1000
00:29:16,931 --> 00:29:17,770
second round,

1001
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:19,720
Bob Sapp comes back and stops him,

1002
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:20,970
but he just,

1003
00:29:20,970 --> 00:29:22,160
you watch that first round,

1004
00:29:22,161 --> 00:29:22,361
you go,

1005
00:29:22,361 --> 00:29:25,660
how the fuck did that guy
get out of that round?

1006
00:29:26,170 --> 00:29:28,510
Anesto who's was teeing off on him?

1007
00:29:28,511 --> 00:29:31,570
He just kept plodding
forward and this is the end.

1008
00:29:33,370 --> 00:29:36,970
He starts fucking just
bombing these hungry,

1009
00:29:36,971 --> 00:29:38,560
hungry hippo punches on them.

1010
00:29:38,710 --> 00:29:39,543
Look at this,

1011
00:29:39,820 --> 00:29:40,481
look at this,

1012
00:29:40,481 --> 00:29:41,060
boom.

1013
00:29:41,060 --> 00:29:41,990
And then the referee comes

1014
00:29:41,990 --> 00:29:42,823
and stops it.

1015
00:29:43,730 --> 00:29:44,563
That's it.

1016
00:29:46,490 --> 00:29:47,750
That is incredible.

1017
00:29:47,970 --> 00:29:48,170
It's,

1018
00:29:48,170 --> 00:29:51,710
you know what time I got to think that
was a premature stoppage and watching

1019
00:29:51,711 --> 00:29:52,860
that it's a shameless guy.

1020
00:29:52,870 --> 00:29:55,790
It's like walking around like
getting a lot of guys in peak now.

1021
00:29:55,820 --> 00:29:56,210
You know,

1022
00:29:56,210 --> 00:29:56,960
cause those guys,

1023
00:29:56,960 --> 00:30:00,230
it's like the first NBA players
are the first baseball players.

1024
00:30:00,260 --> 00:30:05,260
There is no shame in Bob Saps career
and how he came along and when he came

1025
00:30:05,691 --> 00:30:06,180
along,

1026
00:30:06,180 --> 00:30:08,300
you can't say it's a shame cause his,

1027
00:30:08,580 --> 00:30:08,800
the,

1028
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:13,460
the Bob Sapp days or some of the
most incredibly exciting fights ever.

1029
00:30:13,830 --> 00:30:14,660
His fight,

1030
00:30:14,660 --> 00:30:15,081
first of all,

1031
00:30:15,081 --> 00:30:19,570
he's fight with Minataro d there's a
reason why that fight was so excited.

1032
00:30:19,571 --> 00:30:19,660
Yeah.

1033
00:30:19,660 --> 00:30:21,250
And the reason was Bob Sapp,

1034
00:30:21,330 --> 00:30:21,991
I mean miniature,

1035
00:30:21,991 --> 00:30:23,080
it was an amazing fighter,

1036
00:30:23,081 --> 00:30:23,290
right?

1037
00:30:23,290 --> 00:30:24,101
No doubt about it.

1038
00:30:24,101 --> 00:30:29,101
But watching the Toro dismantle
regular fighters was one thing.

1039
00:30:30,040 --> 00:30:33,550
But the fact that he was going to take
on this superhuman was a completely

1040
00:30:33,551 --> 00:30:34,384
different entity.

1041
00:30:34,750 --> 00:30:34,961
You know,

1042
00:30:34,961 --> 00:30:37,390
and obviously it was important
that it was a minute Tara,

1043
00:30:37,391 --> 00:30:39,260
because Tara had such great Jujitsu,

1044
00:30:39,310 --> 00:30:43,420
he could handle a big dude like that and
roll with all the shots and then get to

1045
00:30:43,421 --> 00:30:44,590
a point and finally submit them,

1046
00:30:44,591 --> 00:30:45,424
which he did.

1047
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:50,880
But you got to realize that the Bob Sapp
factor in that fight was the reason why

1048
00:30:51,641 --> 00:30:52,480
it was so exciting.

1049
00:30:52,510 --> 00:30:53,343
It was like,

1050
00:30:53,500 --> 00:30:56,200
this is fucking giant freak.

1051
00:30:56,800 --> 00:31:01,800
This guy that's like 370 pounds like with
a giant six pack and he's picking you

1052
00:31:02,351 --> 00:31:04,060
up and slamming you on your head.

1053
00:31:04,300 --> 00:31:06,400
He slammed him in a
towel down on his head,

1054
00:31:06,401 --> 00:31:10,030
like wrestling style that those,

1055
00:31:10,090 --> 00:31:10,930
those fights,

1056
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:13,070
his fights with um,

1057
00:31:13,330 --> 00:31:14,230
Ernesto hoost,

1058
00:31:14,260 --> 00:31:15,610
the kickboxing fights and he had,

1059
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:18,500
those are some of the
greatest fights to watch over.

1060
00:31:18,900 --> 00:31:21,040
Just ridiculously entertaining.

1061
00:31:21,460 --> 00:31:21,790
So that,

1062
00:31:21,790 --> 00:31:25,540
I don't think you can ever say it's
a shame Bob Sapp didn't come along.

1063
00:31:25,541 --> 00:31:25,841
You know,

1064
00:31:25,841 --> 00:31:26,710
cause when he was around,

1065
00:31:26,830 --> 00:31:27,370
like I said,

1066
00:31:27,370 --> 00:31:29,770
you can only stay that
big for a few years.

1067
00:31:29,890 --> 00:31:30,220
Right.

1068
00:31:30,220 --> 00:31:33,460
But what he did was just fucking crazy.

1069
00:31:34,090 --> 00:31:34,480
You know,

1070
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:36,280
you can't say that guy
doesn't have any hard either.

1071
00:31:36,550 --> 00:31:38,500
You got to look at that beating
that he took with hoost,

1072
00:31:38,530 --> 00:31:38,741
you know,

1073
00:31:38,741 --> 00:31:40,630
he's just not willing to
take beatings anymore.

1074
00:31:40,770 --> 00:31:40,960
Yeah.

1075
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:42,040
Like now he just,

1076
00:31:42,041 --> 00:31:46,810
he goes down and I guess he just just
doesn't have it in them to like really try

1077
00:31:46,811 --> 00:31:48,520
to beat the best guys anymore.

1078
00:31:48,521 --> 00:31:50,290
I sort of just living off his name right.

1079
00:31:50,291 --> 00:31:51,280
It's kind of unfortunate.

1080
00:31:51,460 --> 00:31:51,641
Yeah,

1081
00:31:51,641 --> 00:31:56,110
I think so because at one point in time
I just decided he fucking beat Ernesto

1082
00:31:56,111 --> 00:31:56,930
hoost,

1083
00:31:56,930 --> 00:31:57,580
you know,

1084
00:31:57,580 --> 00:31:58,810
I mean Ernesto,

1085
00:31:58,811 --> 00:32:02,950
who's was trying to kill him and he
survived and the referee stopped it.

1086
00:32:02,951 --> 00:32:05,920
Although I do do agree that it was a or a,

1087
00:32:06,340 --> 00:32:08,920
I believe that it was a quick stoppage.

1088
00:32:08,980 --> 00:32:09,813
I don't think,

1089
00:32:09,880 --> 00:32:11,920
I think who's going to
absorb more of those shots?

1090
00:32:12,070 --> 00:32:12,970
He was standing straight up.

1091
00:32:13,180 --> 00:32:14,013
Right.

1092
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:15,313
You know,

1093
00:32:15,730 --> 00:32:17,140
those kickboxing matches though.

1094
00:32:17,680 --> 00:32:18,513
That's uh,

1095
00:32:18,690 --> 00:32:18,980
they're,

1096
00:32:18,980 --> 00:32:20,860
they're doing this glory.

1097
00:32:20,920 --> 00:32:23,140
They had this a world
series where they had,

1098
00:32:23,141 --> 00:32:23,560
uh,

1099
00:32:23,560 --> 00:32:25,120
they fought four times in a night.

1100
00:32:25,510 --> 00:32:26,380
Did you see that shit

1101
00:32:26,910 --> 00:32:27,290
recently?

1102
00:32:27,290 --> 00:32:27,970
Yeah.

1103
00:32:27,970 --> 00:32:28,270
Uh,

1104
00:32:28,270 --> 00:32:28,850
I saw,

1105
00:32:28,850 --> 00:32:29,870
I write about it.

1106
00:32:29,871 --> 00:32:30,704
I didn't see it.

1107
00:32:31,010 --> 00:32:32,000
It's pretty bad ass.

1108
00:32:32,100 --> 00:32:33,350
I hope they keep doing it.

1109
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:34,553
Yeah.

1110
00:32:35,090 --> 00:32:35,670
What's the name?

1111
00:32:35,670 --> 00:32:36,201
What Cro?

1112
00:32:36,201 --> 00:32:37,160
Cop One last weekend.

1113
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:37,910
Yeah.

1114
00:32:37,910 --> 00:32:38,420
Yeah.

1115
00:32:38,420 --> 00:32:38,661
Cro,

1116
00:32:38,661 --> 00:32:39,180
cop.

1117
00:32:39,180 --> 00:32:39,660
And then um,

1118
00:32:39,660 --> 00:32:39,990
he had

1119
00:32:39,990 --> 00:32:40,741
an MMA fight,

1120
00:32:40,741 --> 00:32:41,040
right.

1121
00:32:41,040 --> 00:32:41,890
He won by arm bar.

1122
00:32:41,920 --> 00:32:42,271
Arm Bar.

1123
00:32:42,271 --> 00:32:42,721
Yeah.

1124
00:32:42,721 --> 00:32:43,620
It looked good.

1125
00:32:44,150 --> 00:32:45,510
And then Tim Silvia lost.

1126
00:32:45,920 --> 00:32:46,281
Yeah.

1127
00:32:46,281 --> 00:32:47,390
He fought a issue,

1128
00:32:47,391 --> 00:32:47,820
right?

1129
00:32:47,820 --> 00:32:48,390
Yup.

1130
00:32:48,390 --> 00:32:48,790
Yeah.

1131
00:32:48,790 --> 00:32:48,970
He,

1132
00:32:48,970 --> 00:32:49,803
she looked good.

1133
00:32:50,390 --> 00:32:51,170
Yeah,

1134
00:32:51,170 --> 00:32:52,070
I saw that too.

1135
00:32:52,700 --> 00:32:53,533
Yeah,

1136
00:32:53,870 --> 00:32:54,381
it's a,

1137
00:32:54,381 --> 00:32:58,310
it's hard to find a good fights
outside the UFC right now.

1138
00:32:59,090 --> 00:32:59,923
Absolutely.

1139
00:33:00,230 --> 00:33:00,680
You know,

1140
00:33:00,680 --> 00:33:01,031
there's,

1141
00:33:01,031 --> 00:33:01,550
um,

1142
00:33:01,550 --> 00:33:06,050
like I think Bella tour puts on some
good fights and it was Strikeforce,

1143
00:33:06,051 --> 00:33:07,790
but now Strikeforce going away.

1144
00:33:07,970 --> 00:33:10,550
So it's like you gotta rely on like dream,

1145
00:33:10,700 --> 00:33:11,211
you know,

1146
00:33:11,211 --> 00:33:13,250
and dream doesn't put on that many shows,

1147
00:33:13,820 --> 00:33:14,091
but they,

1148
00:33:14,091 --> 00:33:18,060
they just had a nice one to
just see that Melvin man who,

1149
00:33:18,230 --> 00:33:18,870
Dennis Kang.

1150
00:33:18,870 --> 00:33:19,650
Yeah,

1151
00:33:19,650 --> 00:33:22,040
the first [inaudible].

1152
00:33:23,010 --> 00:33:26,350
That was the great knee to
Melvin Manhoef as a scary guy.

1153
00:33:26,620 --> 00:33:26,870
Yeah.

1154
00:33:26,870 --> 00:33:27,703
King's garden.

1155
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:28,630
They're both scary guys.

1156
00:33:29,160 --> 00:33:29,441
Thanks.

1157
00:33:29,441 --> 00:33:30,150
Very scary.

1158
00:33:30,150 --> 00:33:30,841
He's very good.

1159
00:33:30,841 --> 00:33:31,430
He's,

1160
00:33:31,430 --> 00:33:32,040
he can,

1161
00:33:32,040 --> 00:33:34,620
Dennis Kang is one of those guys
that if he got it all together,

1162
00:33:34,710 --> 00:33:36,330
put it all together on any given night,

1163
00:33:36,331 --> 00:33:38,070
he could beat any given
fighter in the world.

1164
00:33:38,330 --> 00:33:38,681
You know,

1165
00:33:38,681 --> 00:33:40,360
he's one of those guys that like when you,

1166
00:33:40,361 --> 00:33:42,270
when you see him and he's like really on,

1167
00:33:42,271 --> 00:33:43,650
he's fucking sensational.

1168
00:33:44,010 --> 00:33:44,250
No,

1169
00:33:44,250 --> 00:33:45,690
he's had some really good fights.

1170
00:33:46,170 --> 00:33:47,520
You're real good ground game tail.

1171
00:33:47,970 --> 00:33:48,410
But he's had,

1172
00:33:48,410 --> 00:33:48,521
you know,

1173
00:33:48,521 --> 00:33:51,960
like some mental lapses and
shit and it's fucking hard man.

1174
00:33:52,230 --> 00:33:56,700
It's a crazy sport to try to do that
sport for a living and have your,

1175
00:33:56,701 --> 00:33:58,680
your sanity depending on it.

1176
00:33:58,681 --> 00:34:02,410
And then as you get older you start
reevaluating your priorities and then you

1177
00:34:02,411 --> 00:34:02,740
gotta to,

1178
00:34:02,740 --> 00:34:04,610
of rededicate yourself to something.

1179
00:34:04,611 --> 00:34:04,980
And

1180
00:34:04,980 --> 00:34:05,311
yeah,

1181
00:34:05,311 --> 00:34:05,510
no,

1182
00:34:05,510 --> 00:34:05,700
I,

1183
00:34:05,700 --> 00:34:09,980
I know I wrestled in high
school and college and it
was like my whole life there

1184
00:34:09,990 --> 00:34:11,910
was wrestling and then
when I stopped doing it,

1185
00:34:11,911 --> 00:34:12,181
I was like,

1186
00:34:12,181 --> 00:34:13,014
now what am I going to do?

1187
00:34:13,110 --> 00:34:13,590
You know,

1188
00:34:13,590 --> 00:34:15,030
that happens a lot of athletes.

1189
00:34:15,330 --> 00:34:15,660
Yeah.

1190
00:34:15,660 --> 00:34:16,890
It happens to a lot of people.

1191
00:34:17,130 --> 00:34:22,080
I got really lucky that I found a
standup comedy at the exact same time.

1192
00:34:22,920 --> 00:34:24,810
I was a stopping competing.

1193
00:34:25,110 --> 00:34:26,170
There's basically like a,

1194
00:34:26,180 --> 00:34:27,510
or it was pretty organic,

1195
00:34:27,511 --> 00:34:29,340
the shift from one to the other,

1196
00:34:29,341 --> 00:34:31,950
but I had a lot of friends
that they just would,

1197
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:37,380
nothing seemed as real and
it's as fun as competition.

1198
00:34:37,410 --> 00:34:37,830
Yeah.

1199
00:34:37,830 --> 00:34:38,280
You know,

1200
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:39,091
I have friends that would,

1201
00:34:39,091 --> 00:34:40,980
Jujitsu competition is that way to them.

1202
00:34:41,220 --> 00:34:41,461
You know,

1203
00:34:41,461 --> 00:34:42,480
for some it was the,

1204
00:34:42,481 --> 00:34:42,751
you know,

1205
00:34:42,751 --> 00:34:45,060
the karate tournament or
kickboxing or whatever.

1206
00:34:45,061 --> 00:34:47,280
It is like the thrill of competition,

1207
00:34:47,430 --> 00:34:48,990
even though there's a
lot stress behind it,

1208
00:34:48,991 --> 00:34:50,120
the thrill is like,

1209
00:34:50,430 --> 00:34:52,380
it's really hard to wrap your head around.

1210
00:34:52,810 --> 00:34:53,020
Yeah,

1211
00:34:53,020 --> 00:34:53,853
absolutely.

1212
00:34:54,130 --> 00:34:55,180
I mean to me,

1213
00:34:55,181 --> 00:34:55,420
right?

1214
00:34:55,420 --> 00:34:55,661
Yeah.

1215
00:34:55,661 --> 00:34:59,260
I mean it was like the biggest rush and
you put so much into it and then you

1216
00:34:59,261 --> 00:35:00,460
come down from it and you just like,

1217
00:35:00,490 --> 00:35:01,300
ah man.

1218
00:35:01,300 --> 00:35:01,451
You know,

1219
00:35:01,451 --> 00:35:02,180
now what?

1220
00:35:02,180 --> 00:35:03,013
Now what?

1221
00:35:03,250 --> 00:35:04,280
Luckily I got,

1222
00:35:04,281 --> 00:35:07,810
I had a talk show in college but
ended up getting sued for $20 million.

1223
00:35:08,380 --> 00:35:08,890
Yeah.

1224
00:35:08,890 --> 00:35:11,500
It was like a talk show in college,

1225
00:35:11,980 --> 00:35:12,970
cause I wrestled in high school.

1226
00:35:12,971 --> 00:35:13,631
That was my whole thing.

1227
00:35:13,631 --> 00:35:15,100
And I went to college and I'm like,

1228
00:35:15,160 --> 00:35:15,821
what am I going to do?

1229
00:35:15,821 --> 00:35:17,440
I wrestled for Suny Binghamton,

1230
00:35:17,590 --> 00:35:20,860
actually got a scholarship wrestle for
Hofstra and I would've burned on the same

1231
00:35:20,861 --> 00:35:22,360
team as Baroni and uh,

1232
00:35:22,630 --> 00:35:23,500
and what's his name?

1233
00:35:23,501 --> 00:35:24,334
And um,

1234
00:35:24,490 --> 00:35:25,690
J and j Hieronymus,

1235
00:35:25,700 --> 00:35:26,410
it's a heron,

1236
00:35:26,410 --> 00:35:27,460
which would have been insane.

1237
00:35:27,461 --> 00:35:29,860
But I went to Binghamton and I was like,

1238
00:35:30,220 --> 00:35:31,360
after I was done wrestling,

1239
00:35:31,361 --> 00:35:31,590
I was like,

1240
00:35:31,590 --> 00:35:32,423
what am I going to do?

1241
00:35:32,440 --> 00:35:33,550
I want it like,

1242
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:34,090
you know,

1243
00:35:34,090 --> 00:35:34,811
get something going.

1244
00:35:34,811 --> 00:35:38,140
So I used to prank the local
television every Thursday night.

1245
00:35:38,170 --> 00:35:38,800
They'd be like,

1246
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:39,340
let's go.

1247
00:35:39,340 --> 00:35:39,670
Okay.

1248
00:35:39,670 --> 00:35:39,880
Yeah,

1249
00:35:39,880 --> 00:35:41,530
cause I was cutting weight
and I was miserable.

1250
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:43,240
And you need to have a
serious political combination,

1251
00:35:43,241 --> 00:35:43,421
but hey,

1252
00:35:43,421 --> 00:35:45,840
you debate and debate on my
Dick and then hang up the phone,

1253
00:35:45,850 --> 00:35:46,121
mark.

1254
00:35:46,121 --> 00:35:46,660
Goodness.

1255
00:35:46,660 --> 00:35:50,410
So then I ended up going down to the
station and got my own television show

1256
00:35:50,950 --> 00:35:51,940
called Deez nuts,

1257
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:52,690
but it ended up,

1258
00:35:52,690 --> 00:35:54,340
the show was called Deez nuts.

1259
00:35:54,341 --> 00:35:54,820
Yeah.

1260
00:35:54,820 --> 00:35:55,450
Yeah.

1261
00:35:55,450 --> 00:35:57,030
And I invited this girl up.

1262
00:35:57,340 --> 00:35:58,360
People would call it and be like,

1263
00:35:58,361 --> 00:35:58,811
you suck.

1264
00:35:58,811 --> 00:35:59,051
I'm like,

1265
00:35:59,051 --> 00:35:59,340
oh.

1266
00:35:59,340 --> 00:36:00,290
And I was,

1267
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:01,510
I had nothing to talk about,

1268
00:36:01,530 --> 00:36:02,111
kind of like now,

1269
00:36:02,111 --> 00:36:03,190
but I had nothing to actually,

1270
00:36:03,610 --> 00:36:04,920
so I was like this,

1271
00:36:04,930 --> 00:36:06,030
this girl came on,

1272
00:36:06,040 --> 00:36:07,750
everyone hooked up with named Hannah.

1273
00:36:07,751 --> 00:36:09,160
I want started making fun of her.

1274
00:36:09,370 --> 00:36:10,340
She goes back to her dorm,

1275
00:36:10,360 --> 00:36:13,750
people start throwing water balloons out
her and then they cancel all the shows

1276
00:36:13,751 --> 00:36:14,830
on Binghampton television.

1277
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:16,000
Uh,

1278
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:19,000
because because of my in the night
and she sued me for 20 million from

1279
00:36:19,001 --> 00:36:20,590
negligence cause I
didn't stick up for her,

1280
00:36:21,010 --> 00:36:21,540
but I didn't,

1281
00:36:21,540 --> 00:36:22,540
I didn't ask her to come down.

1282
00:36:23,020 --> 00:36:24,920
But then that was the
highlight of my life at that,

1283
00:36:24,930 --> 00:36:25,451
at that point.

1284
00:36:25,451 --> 00:36:25,751
And I go,

1285
00:36:25,751 --> 00:36:26,740
I want to be a comedian.

1286
00:36:26,830 --> 00:36:27,370
This is,

1287
00:36:27,370 --> 00:36:29,380
how do I get back to this
to have mental talk shit.

1288
00:36:29,630 --> 00:36:30,463
Wow.

1289
00:36:32,850 --> 00:36:33,720
Deez nuts.

1290
00:36:34,500 --> 00:36:35,251
I don't know man.

1291
00:36:35,251 --> 00:36:35,550
It was,

1292
00:36:35,550 --> 00:36:36,383
yes,

1293
00:36:36,630 --> 00:36:39,360
I was seven 17 I'm 17 years old.

1294
00:36:39,690 --> 00:36:40,910
Well I'm glad there's no

1295
00:36:41,010 --> 00:36:45,150
record of me like that from when I was
17 I would have done some stupid shit if

1296
00:36:45,151 --> 00:36:45,611
I could have my,

1297
00:36:45,611 --> 00:36:48,330
like my own internet
show when I was 17 oh,

1298
00:36:48,660 --> 00:36:49,830
people would play it back today.

1299
00:36:49,860 --> 00:36:50,251
But like,

1300
00:36:50,251 --> 00:36:51,810
look how douchey you were.

1301
00:36:51,900 --> 00:36:52,460
Oh yeah.

1302
00:36:52,460 --> 00:36:53,101
Well I'm just,

1303
00:36:53,101 --> 00:36:54,060
you know,

1304
00:36:54,061 --> 00:36:55,080
not that you're any douchey,

1305
00:36:55,081 --> 00:36:57,720
but everybody's douchey
when they're 17 absolutely,

1306
00:36:57,721 --> 00:36:58,180
man,

1307
00:36:58,180 --> 00:36:59,050
it's almost impossible.

1308
00:36:59,060 --> 00:36:59,893
Nappy.

1309
00:37:00,040 --> 00:37:00,821
It's too confusing.

1310
00:37:00,821 --> 00:37:05,410
And plus we were raised by our parents
and I've never met a single person raised

1311
00:37:05,411 --> 00:37:07,090
by parents that knew what
the fuck they were doing.

1312
00:37:07,210 --> 00:37:08,043
Yeah,

1313
00:37:08,080 --> 00:37:08,913
that's true.

1314
00:37:08,920 --> 00:37:12,580
Those pitches were winging it in
the 50s and mom left us three.

1315
00:37:13,030 --> 00:37:13,420
Whoa.

1316
00:37:13,420 --> 00:37:14,020
Yeah,

1317
00:37:14,020 --> 00:37:16,510
so that was why my
bringing me down like this.

1318
00:37:16,770 --> 00:37:17,610
I'm not planning,

1319
00:37:17,630 --> 00:37:19,320
I'm trying to get you to
know where I'm coming from.

1320
00:37:19,321 --> 00:37:19,830
Dude.

1321
00:37:19,830 --> 00:37:20,550
I'm not just gaming.

1322
00:37:20,550 --> 00:37:21,001
I'm not stuck.

1323
00:37:21,001 --> 00:37:21,980
I'm making fun of Bob Sapp.

1324
00:37:22,130 --> 00:37:22,963
Okay.

1325
00:37:23,980 --> 00:37:24,813
Sorry.

1326
00:37:24,970 --> 00:37:25,803
Just fucking with you,

1327
00:37:26,280 --> 00:37:26,850
man.

1328
00:37:26,850 --> 00:37:27,510
Anyway,

1329
00:37:27,510 --> 00:37:28,343
I was trying to talk,

1330
00:37:28,460 --> 00:37:29,121
talk to each other,

1331
00:37:29,121 --> 00:37:29,721
ladies and gentlemen.

1332
00:37:29,721 --> 00:37:29,991
Okay.

1333
00:37:29,991 --> 00:37:31,190
There's no real animosity.

1334
00:37:31,191 --> 00:37:32,630
There were just fuck with each other.

1335
00:37:32,631 --> 00:37:33,740
I was just trying to make you laugh.

1336
00:37:35,180 --> 00:37:36,470
So you lied about your mom.

1337
00:37:37,080 --> 00:37:37,471
No,

1338
00:37:37,471 --> 00:37:37,700
I didn't.

1339
00:37:37,700 --> 00:37:38,020
No,

1340
00:37:38,020 --> 00:37:38,491
no.

1341
00:37:38,491 --> 00:37:39,091
I brought it up.

1342
00:37:39,091 --> 00:37:39,220
I,

1343
00:37:39,220 --> 00:37:39,841
it is true.

1344
00:37:39,841 --> 00:37:40,410
I know it's true.

1345
00:37:40,410 --> 00:37:41,243
I swear to God,

1346
00:37:42,020 --> 00:37:42,640
I was trying,

1347
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:43,860
I brought it up to make you laugh.

1348
00:37:43,950 --> 00:37:44,300
Oh,

1349
00:37:44,300 --> 00:37:45,133
Jesus Christ.

1350
00:37:45,290 --> 00:37:48,610
That would make you laugh like ha ha ha.

1351
00:37:50,700 --> 00:37:52,650
Breaking it up to make you
laugh and make you laugh.

1352
00:37:52,680 --> 00:37:53,513
I don't know.

1353
00:37:53,720 --> 00:37:54,990
Some weird parallel universe.

1354
00:37:55,130 --> 00:37:56,180
I uh,

1355
00:37:56,870 --> 00:37:58,070
I haven't talked to my dad since,

1356
00:37:58,071 --> 00:37:58,970
I think it was seven.

1357
00:37:59,210 --> 00:37:59,690
Oh really?

1358
00:37:59,690 --> 00:38:00,523
Yeah.

1359
00:38:00,770 --> 00:38:02,180
So I know what you're talking about.

1360
00:38:02,220 --> 00:38:02,690
Sorry.

1361
00:38:02,690 --> 00:38:03,440
Sorry to hear that.

1362
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:03,811
Sorry.

1363
00:38:03,811 --> 00:38:05,900
It doesn't bother me anymore.

1364
00:38:06,380 --> 00:38:07,640
I'm sure it did when I was seven.

1365
00:38:07,770 --> 00:38:08,011
Yeah.

1366
00:38:08,011 --> 00:38:10,860
Well I feel like that when you
lose something when you're young,

1367
00:38:11,230 --> 00:38:12,330
like a mom or a dad,

1368
00:38:12,331 --> 00:38:13,050
it just,

1369
00:38:13,050 --> 00:38:15,990
that to me that was the
inner rage in me at least.

1370
00:38:16,120 --> 00:38:16,691
Yeah.

1371
00:38:16,691 --> 00:38:19,540
That's what they say about
boys in divorce as well.

1372
00:38:19,570 --> 00:38:21,190
They say that like girls,

1373
00:38:21,191 --> 00:38:22,450
like when parents separate,

1374
00:38:22,690 --> 00:38:25,510
girls get sad and the boys get angry.

1375
00:38:26,260 --> 00:38:26,860
Yeah.

1376
00:38:26,860 --> 00:38:27,490
Yeah.

1377
00:38:27,490 --> 00:38:28,630
She lives and fulfill,

1378
00:38:28,670 --> 00:38:29,370
abandon the,

1379
00:38:29,370 --> 00:38:32,020
drives them to try to succeed at things

1380
00:38:32,260 --> 00:38:32,701
at any,

1381
00:38:32,701 --> 00:38:33,121
anything.

1382
00:38:33,121 --> 00:38:34,520
And to me now is comedy cut.

1383
00:38:34,710 --> 00:38:35,330
Like that's,

1384
00:38:35,330 --> 00:38:36,950
I love MMA so much.

1385
00:38:36,980 --> 00:38:38,940
But to bring it back was
because the wrestling like you,

1386
00:38:39,010 --> 00:38:39,590
it's,

1387
00:38:39,590 --> 00:38:41,900
to me MMA is professional wrestling,

1388
00:38:41,930 --> 00:38:43,190
like not like pro wrestling,

1389
00:38:43,191 --> 00:38:43,371
you know?

1390
00:38:43,371 --> 00:38:45,800
WBB But like that's our major leaks.

1391
00:38:46,030 --> 00:38:46,580
Right.

1392
00:38:46,580 --> 00:38:48,050
So I always root for those guys,

1393
00:38:48,670 --> 00:38:50,920
but I wouldn't have gotten into
wrestling if it wasn't for the rage of,

1394
00:38:52,030 --> 00:38:55,220
of like my mom leaving and then I wouldn't
have gotten a comedy if it wasn't for

1395
00:38:55,221 --> 00:38:55,851
that rage too.

1396
00:38:55,851 --> 00:38:59,720
So now I can bring it all back
by combining MMA and comedy.

1397
00:39:00,110 --> 00:39:00,943
That's funny.

1398
00:39:01,050 --> 00:39:01,400
Um,

1399
00:39:01,400 --> 00:39:02,510
have you ever done,

1400
00:39:02,511 --> 00:39:03,590
I mean you've been doing these,

1401
00:39:03,591 --> 00:39:04,220
uh,

1402
00:39:04,220 --> 00:39:08,600
these roasted videos now and if you ever
done anything that you wish you pulled

1403
00:39:08,601 --> 00:39:09,434
back,

1404
00:39:09,830 --> 00:39:11,180
have I ever said something?

1405
00:39:11,181 --> 00:39:12,230
And I said,

1406
00:39:12,231 --> 00:39:12,410
Bro,

1407
00:39:12,410 --> 00:39:14,460
I go pretty Palmer,

1408
00:39:14,510 --> 00:39:16,560
more guys that pulled out at
one 51 that Brittany polymer.

1409
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:17,140
Right.

1410
00:39:17,140 --> 00:39:17,600
And,

1411
00:39:17,600 --> 00:39:18,220
and,

1412
00:39:18,220 --> 00:39:18,780
and,

1413
00:39:18,780 --> 00:39:19,131
and I,

1414
00:39:19,131 --> 00:39:21,830
I think it hurt her feelings because I
like met her up before that and she was

1415
00:39:21,831 --> 00:39:23,200
super sweet and kind and I,

1416
00:39:23,201 --> 00:39:27,290
and I kind of like burned a bridge there
because then I felt bad because I was

1417
00:39:27,470 --> 00:39:28,130
only,

1418
00:39:28,130 --> 00:39:29,560
there was only a hearsay that she took.

1419
00:39:29,720 --> 00:39:30,770
She said in the video,

1420
00:39:30,890 --> 00:39:31,760
I like fighters.

1421
00:39:31,820 --> 00:39:33,470
There's a video of her on youtube saying,

1422
00:39:33,530 --> 00:39:33,861
oh,

1423
00:39:33,861 --> 00:39:34,820
fighters are cute or something,

1424
00:39:34,821 --> 00:39:36,350
how to pick up Brittany
Palmer or whatever it is.

1425
00:39:36,680 --> 00:39:38,540
So I figured if she's
comfortable enough with that,

1426
00:39:38,541 --> 00:39:39,374
then I could say that.

1427
00:39:39,650 --> 00:39:40,820
Oh well that's ridiculous.

1428
00:39:41,060 --> 00:39:41,840
Listen man,

1429
00:39:41,840 --> 00:39:43,140
if you're a girl like Brittney Palmer,

1430
00:39:43,160 --> 00:39:46,220
they do these questionnaire things
and I'm sure they ask her like,

1431
00:39:46,460 --> 00:39:47,420
how do you feel about fighters?

1432
00:39:47,910 --> 00:39:50,140
And I being set up is
the whole UFC outside,

1433
00:39:50,141 --> 00:39:50,974
right?

1434
00:39:51,060 --> 00:39:51,580
Oh,

1435
00:39:51,580 --> 00:39:52,450
walk outside,

1436
00:39:52,451 --> 00:39:53,284
it's going to be killed.

1437
00:39:53,740 --> 00:39:55,240
And Brittany Palmer and never do this.

1438
00:39:55,540 --> 00:39:56,710
Bruce buffer and Gober.

1439
00:39:56,860 --> 00:39:57,640
How dare you.

1440
00:39:57,640 --> 00:39:58,600
I would never do that.

1441
00:39:58,770 --> 00:39:59,211
No Dude,

1442
00:39:59,211 --> 00:40:00,690
this is like nobody wants it

1443
00:40:00,710 --> 00:40:01,310
set you up.

1444
00:40:01,310 --> 00:40:01,791
I look,

1445
00:40:01,791 --> 00:40:02,624
I think it's funny.

1446
00:40:02,810 --> 00:40:03,530
I love her.

1447
00:40:03,530 --> 00:40:03,951
She's a,

1448
00:40:03,951 --> 00:40:04,784
she's a nice kid.

1449
00:40:05,060 --> 00:40:05,630
She's,

1450
00:40:05,630 --> 00:40:06,463
you know,

1451
00:40:06,620 --> 00:40:11,620
but she's a girl and girls don't like
dudes making jokes about pulling dicks out

1452
00:40:11,691 --> 00:40:12,524
of them.

1453
00:40:14,050 --> 00:40:14,883
Absolutely.

1454
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:16,240
I understand that there has,

1455
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:18,800
but there's always gotta
be a victim in comedy.

1456
00:40:19,180 --> 00:40:19,671
And I know,

1457
00:40:19,671 --> 00:40:20,310
I understand.

1458
00:40:20,310 --> 00:40:21,350
I'm on your side as well.

1459
00:40:21,380 --> 00:40:22,530
I tried to make it nice up.

1460
00:40:22,610 --> 00:40:23,270
Listen,

1461
00:40:23,270 --> 00:40:26,230
I work with those girls and they're
very nice and the nice to me and we're

1462
00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:26,750
friends.

1463
00:40:26,750 --> 00:40:30,230
So like I would never crack jokes
about them cause I love them.

1464
00:40:30,300 --> 00:40:30,741
They're there,

1465
00:40:30,741 --> 00:40:31,580
they're sweet girls.

1466
00:40:32,060 --> 00:40:33,350
But I,

1467
00:40:33,590 --> 00:40:33,890
you know,

1468
00:40:33,890 --> 00:40:34,190
when you,

1469
00:40:34,190 --> 00:40:35,180
you say something like that,

1470
00:40:35,181 --> 00:40:35,871
I have to laugh.

1471
00:40:35,871 --> 00:40:36,440
It's funny,

1472
00:40:36,440 --> 00:40:38,710
I had to laugh because
there's a certain truth.

1473
00:40:38,711 --> 00:40:39,161
It if I,

1474
00:40:39,161 --> 00:40:39,810
if I like,

1475
00:40:39,810 --> 00:40:41,470
and that's why you're laughing.

1476
00:40:41,830 --> 00:40:45,010
If I would've said Kim Winslow's more
fighters have hooked up with a lot of it,

1477
00:40:45,011 --> 00:40:45,850
then Kim Winslow,

1478
00:40:45,940 --> 00:40:46,773
you would have been like,

1479
00:40:46,780 --> 00:40:47,613
ah,

1480
00:40:47,660 --> 00:40:48,190
nope.

1481
00:40:48,190 --> 00:40:48,611
Well,

1482
00:40:48,611 --> 00:40:49,360
you know,

1483
00:40:49,360 --> 00:40:49,871
first of all,

1484
00:40:49,871 --> 00:40:53,260
you just assuming that she's
hooked up with fighters,

1485
00:40:53,350 --> 00:40:54,110
unless you,

1486
00:40:54,110 --> 00:40:54,943
I do know.

1487
00:40:55,100 --> 00:40:55,690
I don't want,

1488
00:40:55,690 --> 00:40:56,030
okay.

1489
00:40:56,030 --> 00:40:56,863
I know of one,

1490
00:40:57,230 --> 00:40:58,820
so I'm not,

1491
00:40:58,850 --> 00:40:59,683
I'm not assuming.

1492
00:41:00,090 --> 00:41:00,430
Okay,

1493
00:41:00,430 --> 00:41:00,960
awesome.

1494
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:03,640
It's very womanly and gossipy because you,

1495
00:41:03,670 --> 00:41:06,360
you haven't had conversations
with her about this.

1496
00:41:06,750 --> 00:41:07,200
No.

1497
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:09,210
But you and her having talked about like,

1498
00:41:09,240 --> 00:41:12,540
so this is just you finding out
about her dating life online.

1499
00:41:13,550 --> 00:41:13,761
No,

1500
00:41:13,761 --> 00:41:16,280
front people from friends of
fighters or fighters themselves.

1501
00:41:16,281 --> 00:41:17,840
So I'm not like,

1502
00:41:17,960 --> 00:41:18,793
okay,

1503
00:41:18,950 --> 00:41:19,370
yes,

1504
00:41:19,370 --> 00:41:20,203
I understand.

1505
00:41:21,260 --> 00:41:21,500
No,

1506
00:41:21,500 --> 00:41:22,110
no,

1507
00:41:22,110 --> 00:41:23,280
I've just made it worse.

1508
00:41:26,020 --> 00:41:26,200
I was

1509
00:41:26,200 --> 00:41:26,590
going to say it,

1510
00:41:26,590 --> 00:41:28,900
but it's funny and that's the problem.

1511
00:41:28,901 --> 00:41:29,650
It's funny.

1512
00:41:29,650 --> 00:41:30,620
And even though it's,

1513
00:41:30,621 --> 00:41:31,030
it's,

1514
00:41:31,030 --> 00:41:36,030
it's operating on a notion that these
attractive girls would make these

1515
00:41:36,301 --> 00:41:38,160
attractive guys had perceived

1516
00:41:40,010 --> 00:41:41,670
for legal reasons.

1517
00:41:41,900 --> 00:41:42,081
Yeah.

1518
00:41:42,081 --> 00:41:43,030
Sorry about that man.

1519
00:41:43,720 --> 00:41:45,920
Fuck I was to represent people correctly.

1520
00:41:45,950 --> 00:41:46,250
Yeah,

1521
00:41:46,250 --> 00:41:46,940
I know.

1522
00:41:46,940 --> 00:41:47,773
I got another.

1523
00:41:48,380 --> 00:41:49,030
But uh,

1524
00:41:49,030 --> 00:41:49,261
my,

1525
00:41:49,261 --> 00:41:50,900
my point is it's still funny,

1526
00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:53,290
so you got to say thank you.

1527
00:41:53,330 --> 00:41:54,100
And you know what?

1528
00:41:54,100 --> 00:41:54,510
Um,

1529
00:41:54,510 --> 00:41:57,350
and if you're a person that's
getting mugged on like that,

1530
00:41:57,351 --> 00:41:58,820
you have to laugh at the good ones.

1531
00:41:59,030 --> 00:41:59,390
Oh,

1532
00:41:59,390 --> 00:42:00,050
right.

1533
00:42:00,050 --> 00:42:00,883
I know.

1534
00:42:02,230 --> 00:42:03,440
I always like my comedy.

1535
00:42:03,510 --> 00:42:04,010
I get,

1536
00:42:04,010 --> 00:42:04,850
I'm on a storyteller.

1537
00:42:04,851 --> 00:42:05,271
Comedy,

1538
00:42:05,271 --> 00:42:07,400
I tell jokes really quick one liner jokes.

1539
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:08,541
Twitter is great for me.

1540
00:42:08,541 --> 00:42:09,890
It's like an online focus room.

1541
00:42:09,910 --> 00:42:10,220
You know,

1542
00:42:10,220 --> 00:42:12,320
I got to tell a joke
and you get 50 people,

1543
00:42:12,321 --> 00:42:13,820
a hundred guys at all hours of the day.

1544
00:42:13,821 --> 00:42:14,480
It's great.

1545
00:42:14,480 --> 00:42:14,661
Yeah.

1546
00:42:14,661 --> 00:42:16,310
You really look a Twitter writer.

1547
00:42:16,311 --> 00:42:17,060
It's like a,

1548
00:42:17,060 --> 00:42:18,550
it's funny how was styles,

1549
00:42:18,670 --> 00:42:20,020
comedy are so different.

1550
00:42:20,021 --> 00:42:22,960
You know like some guys like
Ari Shaffir for example,

1551
00:42:23,590 --> 00:42:25,360
he writes in like long bits,

1552
00:42:25,361 --> 00:42:25,660
you know,

1553
00:42:25,660 --> 00:42:29,350
he writes like he'll start talking about
something and he'll explore a subject

1554
00:42:29,351 --> 00:42:32,410
and then he'll write like this long
bit where it's like you're like,

1555
00:42:32,440 --> 00:42:32,771
you're,

1556
00:42:32,771 --> 00:42:34,360
you're like 150 characters.

1557
00:42:34,370 --> 00:42:34,960
You're good

1558
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:36,370
hundred 30 cause you
gotta get it retweeted.

1559
00:42:36,640 --> 00:42:39,040
I actually figured this out.

1560
00:42:39,910 --> 00:42:44,910
That's so silly at 20 but can you just
hit the retweet button and it doesn't

1561
00:42:46,071 --> 00:42:46,151
know,

1562
00:42:46,151 --> 00:42:46,940
just retweet down,

1563
00:42:46,940 --> 00:42:48,200
sees that whatsapp,

1564
00:42:48,580 --> 00:42:50,950
is that really it gets
cut off or something?

1565
00:42:51,030 --> 00:42:52,270
No one sees the actual retweets.

1566
00:42:52,500 --> 00:42:54,310
Not a lot of people have
it set so that you know,

1567
00:42:54,340 --> 00:42:55,320
they don't see retweets.

1568
00:42:55,350 --> 00:42:55,571
Oh,

1569
00:42:55,571 --> 00:42:56,050
right,

1570
00:42:56,050 --> 00:42:56,620
right.

1571
00:42:56,620 --> 00:42:57,520
Why would you do that?

1572
00:42:57,550 --> 00:42:58,270
That's silly.

1573
00:42:58,270 --> 00:43:01,090
I find that I'm one of the most
of the cool shit from retweets.

1574
00:43:01,610 --> 00:43:03,320
So someone tells me something,

1575
00:43:03,350 --> 00:43:03,801
you know,

1576
00:43:03,801 --> 00:43:04,634
like if,

1577
00:43:04,730 --> 00:43:07,870
if somebody sends me something really
interesting and then I retweeted,

1578
00:43:07,940 --> 00:43:08,510
you know,

1579
00:43:08,510 --> 00:43:10,670
I'm retweeting it
because it's interesting.

1580
00:43:10,710 --> 00:43:11,530
I would,

1581
00:43:11,530 --> 00:43:11,681
yeah,

1582
00:43:11,681 --> 00:43:13,900
but if you retweeted the opposite though,

1583
00:43:13,901 --> 00:43:15,730
the way of putting the rt before it,

1584
00:43:15,731 --> 00:43:19,010
more people will see it then as then
actually just hitting the retweet butts.

1585
00:43:19,020 --> 00:43:20,170
So I'll start doing that.

1586
00:43:20,171 --> 00:43:22,390
Then we got to destroy our team.

1587
00:43:23,060 --> 00:43:23,850
Yeah.

1588
00:43:23,850 --> 00:43:25,410
Why you make a lot more people,

1589
00:43:25,450 --> 00:43:27,550
a lot more people and just
worked having to remember that.

1590
00:43:27,551 --> 00:43:30,190
And that's the actual work probably is
the fact that I have to remember it,

1591
00:43:30,191 --> 00:43:30,580
you know?

1592
00:43:30,580 --> 00:43:30,701
Yeah.

1593
00:43:30,701 --> 00:43:32,050
Maybe I should use like tweet deck.

1594
00:43:32,080 --> 00:43:33,400
What's the best shit to use?

1595
00:43:33,970 --> 00:43:34,421
Uh,

1596
00:43:34,421 --> 00:43:35,380
I like tweet Bot.

1597
00:43:35,470 --> 00:43:36,303
Tweet Bot.

1598
00:43:36,730 --> 00:43:37,563
Okay.

1599
00:43:37,750 --> 00:43:38,583
Yeah,

1600
00:43:38,650 --> 00:43:41,050
it's stressful.

1601
00:43:41,051 --> 00:43:42,670
And did you see Alex Jones?

1602
00:43:43,120 --> 00:43:43,920
Oh my God.

1603
00:43:43,920 --> 00:43:48,100
Oh my [inaudible] about it at a red light.

1604
00:43:48,160 --> 00:43:48,451
Yeah,

1605
00:43:48,451 --> 00:43:48,790
this is,

1606
00:43:48,790 --> 00:43:50,580
I guess he was on on,

1607
00:43:50,620 --> 00:43:51,060
well,

1608
00:43:51,060 --> 00:43:51,940
who show was this?

1609
00:43:52,060 --> 00:43:52,920
Here's Morgan.

1610
00:43:52,960 --> 00:43:53,470
He's trying to get it.

1611
00:43:53,470 --> 00:43:54,630
I'll give you the background

1612
00:43:54,690 --> 00:43:57,600
before he puts Alex Jones,

1613
00:43:57,630 --> 00:43:59,940
because Pierce Morgan
said that we should all,

1614
00:44:00,030 --> 00:44:01,500
we should take our guns.

1615
00:44:01,590 --> 00:44:01,921
You know,

1616
00:44:01,921 --> 00:44:06,120
we should no longer a that the second
amendment no longer applies in today's

1617
00:44:06,121 --> 00:44:06,511
age.

1618
00:44:06,511 --> 00:44:08,190
And with all these school
shootings and shit,

1619
00:44:08,850 --> 00:44:11,370
we should figure out how
a way to control the guns.

1620
00:44:11,490 --> 00:44:11,641
Well,

1621
00:44:11,641 --> 00:44:13,920
Alex said that he's not
even an American citizen.

1622
00:44:13,921 --> 00:44:17,370
He should be deported for saying such
things and challenging our second

1623
00:44:17,371 --> 00:44:18,210
amendment rights.

1624
00:44:18,480 --> 00:44:19,200
So,

1625
00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:19,770
uh,

1626
00:44:19,770 --> 00:44:20,603
Pierce Morgan,

1627
00:44:20,980 --> 00:44:25,350
like the slide devil that he is
invited Alex to go on his show.

1628
00:44:25,500 --> 00:44:28,650
And so Alex went on a show and promptly,

1629
00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:30,780
promptly lost his fucking mind.

1630
00:44:31,910 --> 00:44:32,670
Promptly.

1631
00:44:32,670 --> 00:44:35,220
Completely went off the deep end.

1632
00:44:35,550 --> 00:44:39,810
He looks like a Chubby
Madman and I love him.

1633
00:44:39,960 --> 00:44:40,291
You know,

1634
00:44:40,291 --> 00:44:41,250
Alex is my brother.

1635
00:44:41,280 --> 00:44:42,210
I love that dude.

1636
00:44:42,211 --> 00:44:43,410
Every time I go to Austin,

1637
00:44:43,411 --> 00:44:44,430
I hang out with that guy.

1638
00:44:44,610 --> 00:44:45,443
We eat dinner,

1639
00:44:45,540 --> 00:44:46,920
I do his radio show.

1640
00:44:46,921 --> 00:44:47,830
We did a little,

1641
00:44:47,831 --> 00:44:50,100
a cool backstage interview
and me and Brian Recently,

1642
00:44:50,130 --> 00:44:54,750
I fucking love Alex Jones and he's right
about a lot of shit that the documents,

1643
00:44:54,870 --> 00:44:55,620
but this is those.

1644
00:44:55,620 --> 00:44:57,150
The documents has got the documents.

1645
00:44:57,340 --> 00:45:02,260
Those are the documents and
play it play at a level.

1646
00:45:02,290 --> 00:45:03,340
But overall muggings,

1647
00:45:03,341 --> 00:45:03,821
stabbings,

1648
00:45:03,821 --> 00:45:04,250
deaths,

1649
00:45:04,250 --> 00:45:05,350
you those men,

1650
00:45:05,351 --> 00:45:05,591
right?

1651
00:45:05,591 --> 00:45:08,830
That woman in India to death
with an iron rod four feet long.

1652
00:45:08,950 --> 00:45:12,280
You can't ban the iron rods
that guns the iron rods.

1653
00:45:12,281 --> 00:45:13,780
Pierce didn't do it.

1654
00:45:13,840 --> 00:45:14,830
The tyrants did it.

1655
00:45:14,890 --> 00:45:16,660
Hitler took the guns stolen,

1656
00:45:16,661 --> 00:45:17,410
took the guns,

1657
00:45:17,410 --> 00:45:18,840
mounted the guns that don't.

1658
00:45:18,850 --> 00:45:19,900
Castro took the guns,

1659
00:45:20,260 --> 00:45:20,410
go.

1660
00:45:20,410 --> 00:45:23,020
Chavez took the guns and I'm
here to tell you it's two.

1661
00:45:23,070 --> 00:45:26,830
The 76 will commence again if
you proud to take our firearms.

1662
00:45:26,920 --> 00:45:30,100
It doesn't matter how many lemmings you
get out there on the street begging for

1663
00:45:30,101 --> 00:45:31,300
them to have their guns taken.

1664
00:45:31,360 --> 00:45:32,800
We will not relinquish them.

1665
00:45:32,890 --> 00:45:34,000
Do you understand?

1666
00:45:34,130 --> 00:45:35,410
And that's why you're going to fail.

1667
00:45:35,411 --> 00:45:36,730
And the establishment knows,

1668
00:45:36,820 --> 00:45:40,180
no matter how much propaganda
the republic will rise again.

1669
00:45:40,240 --> 00:45:43,390
When you attempt to take our guns
for half family and the first of all,

1670
00:45:43,391 --> 00:45:44,224
pause right here.

1671
00:45:45,010 --> 00:45:45,820
Pierce Morgan

1672
00:45:45,820 --> 00:45:47,200
fucked up.

1673
00:45:47,530 --> 00:45:48,970
He fucked up.

1674
00:45:49,240 --> 00:45:49,601
Pierce,

1675
00:45:49,601 --> 00:45:50,710
what have you done?

1676
00:45:50,980 --> 00:45:54,520
You let Alex Jones on your show.

1677
00:45:54,910 --> 00:45:57,850
You just let Alex Jones
go off on your show.

1678
00:45:57,900 --> 00:45:58,860
You think it's going to help them though?

1679
00:45:58,861 --> 00:46:00,960
I mean the first sure.

1680
00:46:00,961 --> 00:46:01,710
It'll help them.

1681
00:46:01,710 --> 00:46:03,090
You don't think people are going
to look at that and be like,

1682
00:46:03,180 --> 00:46:05,130
this guy's out of his mind for sure.

1683
00:46:05,131 --> 00:46:06,510
There's going to be that as well.

1684
00:46:09,510 --> 00:46:11,270
Mimicking his accident at one point

1685
00:46:14,460 --> 00:46:17,820
was running for president member or
I'm already flipped out and said,

1686
00:46:17,821 --> 00:46:19,380
we're going to this and that and that.

1687
00:46:19,381 --> 00:46:20,214
It reminds you of,

1688
00:46:20,500 --> 00:46:21,333
yeah.

1689
00:46:21,660 --> 00:46:21,841
Yeah.

1690
00:46:21,841 --> 00:46:23,070
He went crazy and then that was it.

1691
00:46:23,071 --> 00:46:23,281
They're like,

1692
00:46:23,281 --> 00:46:25,390
we're not getting this
guy from our president.

1693
00:46:25,400 --> 00:46:28,170
That one sound that he made
Sanches whole campaign.

1694
00:46:28,200 --> 00:46:29,033
It's kind of the,

1695
00:46:29,150 --> 00:46:31,460
don't you think that people are looking
at the message that this guy's doing is

1696
00:46:31,470 --> 00:46:32,101
out of control?

1697
00:46:32,101 --> 00:46:32,461
Rant.

1698
00:46:32,461 --> 00:46:33,294
Lunatic.

1699
00:46:33,390 --> 00:46:35,370
How did Howard Dean
never recover from that?

1700
00:46:35,371 --> 00:46:37,170
How would you need to like
get your shit together?

1701
00:46:37,260 --> 00:46:37,860
Come back.

1702
00:46:37,860 --> 00:46:38,890
He was like strong.

1703
00:46:39,570 --> 00:46:40,403
Oh.

1704
00:46:41,150 --> 00:46:43,470
He was up there and he was
a strong candidate man.

1705
00:46:43,471 --> 00:46:44,460
Smart Guy.

1706
00:46:45,060 --> 00:46:45,960
Governor of Vermont,

1707
00:46:45,961 --> 00:46:46,151
right?

1708
00:46:46,151 --> 00:46:46,980
Yep.

1709
00:46:46,980 --> 00:46:49,510
That's a little sketchy fucker.

1710
00:46:49,580 --> 00:46:50,413
People Vermont.

1711
00:46:50,430 --> 00:46:51,360
20 people up there.

1712
00:46:51,440 --> 00:46:51,710
Yeah,

1713
00:46:51,710 --> 00:46:52,080
it's me.

1714
00:46:52,080 --> 00:46:52,381
Come on.

1715
00:46:52,381 --> 00:46:53,214
Let's be real.

1716
00:46:53,910 --> 00:46:54,360
That's true.

1717
00:46:54,360 --> 00:46:56,160
We'll probably going to get tweets
from people that are in Vermont.

1718
00:46:56,190 --> 00:46:56,640
Dude.

1719
00:46:56,640 --> 00:46:57,301
Fuck you.

1720
00:46:57,301 --> 00:46:58,530
This is way more than 20 people.

1721
00:46:58,560 --> 00:46:59,700
It's amazing computer.

1722
00:46:59,940 --> 00:47:00,330
I know.

1723
00:47:00,330 --> 00:47:01,230
He likes skiing.

1724
00:47:01,231 --> 00:47:02,064
Okay.

1725
00:47:02,520 --> 00:47:03,510
I went to high school in Maine.

1726
00:47:03,570 --> 00:47:04,403
That was pretty amazing.

1727
00:47:04,470 --> 00:47:04,681
Yeah,

1728
00:47:04,681 --> 00:47:05,610
you were talking about that.

1729
00:47:05,630 --> 00:47:05,970
Where,

1730
00:47:05,970 --> 00:47:06,803
where'd you go?

1731
00:47:06,870 --> 00:47:08,880
I went to a boarding school
called the Hyde School.

1732
00:47:09,060 --> 00:47:13,440
It was like for a kids
who needed a kidney.

1733
00:47:13,560 --> 00:47:13,771
Yeah,

1734
00:47:13,771 --> 00:47:14,880
like alternative education.

1735
00:47:14,910 --> 00:47:15,721
It was really good though.

1736
00:47:15,721 --> 00:47:16,160
I mean

1737
00:47:16,160 --> 00:47:17,630
alternative education.

1738
00:47:17,631 --> 00:47:18,441
What does that mean?

1739
00:47:18,441 --> 00:47:20,090
Alternative to regular school,

1740
00:47:20,120 --> 00:47:21,290
which was a problem.

1741
00:47:21,530 --> 00:47:21,921
Yeah,

1742
00:47:21,921 --> 00:47:22,400
because I,

1743
00:47:22,400 --> 00:47:23,233
because I was,

1744
00:47:23,240 --> 00:47:24,260
I was hanging out with the wrong,

1745
00:47:24,290 --> 00:47:27,530
I was getting bullied a lot and I was
hanging out with the wrong kids and I

1746
00:47:27,531 --> 00:47:28,350
thought if I hung out with the,

1747
00:47:28,350 --> 00:47:29,620
with the tough kids that like,

1748
00:47:29,950 --> 00:47:31,120
then I would be tough.

1749
00:47:31,121 --> 00:47:32,230
But they just kicked my ass,

1750
00:47:33,010 --> 00:47:34,360
made me do horrible things,

1751
00:47:35,080 --> 00:47:36,160
awful strategy.

1752
00:47:36,161 --> 00:47:39,200
And then I was angry at my stepmom for an,

1753
00:47:39,320 --> 00:47:39,701
you know,

1754
00:47:39,701 --> 00:47:41,620
my dad and my dad managed
Alice Cooper in the,

1755
00:47:41,621 --> 00:47:42,400
in the 60s.

1756
00:47:42,400 --> 00:47:43,650
And he,

1757
00:47:43,890 --> 00:47:44,470
he has this,

1758
00:47:44,470 --> 00:47:45,251
he's like a Hippie,

1759
00:47:45,251 --> 00:47:45,821
great father.

1760
00:47:45,821 --> 00:47:46,201
But he was,

1761
00:47:46,201 --> 00:47:48,300
he was talking about pot back then,

1762
00:47:48,370 --> 00:47:48,701
whatever.

1763
00:47:48,701 --> 00:47:49,230
My mom,

1764
00:47:49,230 --> 00:47:49,960
you set mom,

1765
00:47:49,960 --> 00:47:51,440
we get along and how we do it.

1766
00:47:51,450 --> 00:47:51,731
But anyway,

1767
00:47:51,731 --> 00:47:54,910
I got sent to boarding school
for troubled kids and uh,

1768
00:47:55,210 --> 00:47:55,750
wow.

1769
00:47:55,750 --> 00:47:56,140
You couldn't,

1770
00:47:56,140 --> 00:47:56,771
you couldn't lie,

1771
00:47:56,771 --> 00:47:57,101
steal,

1772
00:47:57,101 --> 00:47:57,551
cheat,

1773
00:47:57,551 --> 00:47:57,901
drink,

1774
00:47:57,901 --> 00:47:58,630
have sex.

1775
00:47:58,630 --> 00:48:00,310
So you were like a bad kid.

1776
00:48:00,560 --> 00:48:01,540
You're on your way.

1777
00:48:01,570 --> 00:48:03,070
Not that it was your fault,

1778
00:48:03,100 --> 00:48:03,970
but it was my fault.

1779
00:48:04,010 --> 00:48:04,890
I'm not going to take,

1780
00:48:05,010 --> 00:48:05,230
yeah,

1781
00:48:05,230 --> 00:48:05,650
I wasn't bad.

1782
00:48:05,650 --> 00:48:06,580
It wasn't a bad kid,

1783
00:48:06,581 --> 00:48:08,740
but I definitely had wrong energies.

1784
00:48:08,800 --> 00:48:12,640
I could have been focusing on
more positive things in my life.

1785
00:48:12,670 --> 00:48:14,050
I think for a lot of kids,

1786
00:48:14,230 --> 00:48:18,970
life is like a really super complicated
puzzle that doesn't have an directions

1787
00:48:18,971 --> 00:48:19,804
book.

1788
00:48:20,850 --> 00:48:21,550
Fuck,

1789
00:48:21,550 --> 00:48:23,980
where am I going for most of us,

1790
00:48:23,981 --> 00:48:25,540
like by the time we're like,

1791
00:48:25,541 --> 00:48:26,230
you know,

1792
00:48:26,230 --> 00:48:27,460
someone's telling you to get a job,

1793
00:48:27,461 --> 00:48:27,971
get out of the house,

1794
00:48:27,971 --> 00:48:29,220
you got to get a job and you know,

1795
00:48:29,230 --> 00:48:31,090
move out on your own and you're like,

1796
00:48:31,091 --> 00:48:33,850
what did you motherfuckers teach me?

1797
00:48:33,880 --> 00:48:37,750
Like you didn't teach me enough
life skills to sustain myself.

1798
00:48:37,751 --> 00:48:40,210
Or the worst thing that they need to
teach a kid is that adults are always

1799
00:48:40,211 --> 00:48:40,740
right.

1800
00:48:40,740 --> 00:48:41,051
Yeah.

1801
00:48:41,051 --> 00:48:42,910
Because you assume that they're older.

1802
00:48:42,911 --> 00:48:43,550
They're right.

1803
00:48:43,550 --> 00:48:43,780
When,

1804
00:48:43,780 --> 00:48:45,850
how many dumb asses do
you know are our age?

1805
00:48:45,970 --> 00:48:46,803
You know,

1806
00:48:47,920 --> 00:48:48,820
age doesn't mean anything.

1807
00:48:48,880 --> 00:48:49,840
As a matter of fact,

1808
00:48:49,990 --> 00:48:51,040
there's a lot of people that,

1809
00:48:51,041 --> 00:48:52,390
I used to think they're really smart,

1810
00:48:52,391 --> 00:48:54,730
but somewhere along
the line stop thinking,

1811
00:48:55,300 --> 00:48:56,800
I don't know what the fuck happened,

1812
00:48:56,801 --> 00:48:57,310
but the,

1813
00:48:57,310 --> 00:48:58,330
sometimes I think I'm smart,

1814
00:48:58,990 --> 00:49:00,220
a word will come up and I'll be like,

1815
00:49:00,221 --> 00:49:01,150
what does that mean?

1816
00:49:01,300 --> 00:49:03,910
And it's like opens up a whole
book of things I don't know.

1817
00:49:03,911 --> 00:49:04,630
And I'm just like,

1818
00:49:04,630 --> 00:49:04,990
ah,

1819
00:49:04,990 --> 00:49:05,823
Jesus.

1820
00:49:07,680 --> 00:49:08,080
I'm like,

1821
00:49:08,080 --> 00:49:09,130
I got to learn some shit,

1822
00:49:09,131 --> 00:49:09,964
man.

1823
00:49:10,210 --> 00:49:12,050
No one can be smart in this day and age.

1824
00:49:12,051 --> 00:49:14,530
She could be reasonably knowledgeable.

1825
00:49:14,590 --> 00:49:15,920
That's the best you could hope for it.

1826
00:49:15,930 --> 00:49:17,800
There's just too much
information to the jail.

1827
00:49:17,801 --> 00:49:19,750
I feel like you're wired
and I'm not trying to like,

1828
00:49:19,930 --> 00:49:21,530
like kiss your ass or
blow you right there.

1829
00:49:21,620 --> 00:49:23,830
I feel like you're wired in a way or like,

1830
00:49:23,831 --> 00:49:24,161
you know,

1831
00:49:24,161 --> 00:49:27,490
so much more stuff than
like the average Joe.

1832
00:49:27,590 --> 00:49:28,690
Like I,

1833
00:49:28,790 --> 00:49:29,051
I'll,

1834
00:49:29,051 --> 00:49:29,621
I'll read your tweet,

1835
00:49:29,621 --> 00:49:32,080

like three o'clock in the morning,

1836
00:49:32,110 --> 00:49:33,090

1837
00:49:33,360 --> 00:49:38,360

different subjects and I'm like,

1838
00:49:38,651 --> 00:49:40,240
when and then you're
touring and then I'm like,

1839
00:49:40,241 --> 00:49:41,440
well this guy's got two kids.

1840
00:49:41,441 --> 00:49:42,191
When does this fucker,

1841
00:49:42,191 --> 00:49:42,850
it's sleep.

1842
00:49:42,850 --> 00:49:44,060
Like how do I get some water?

1843
00:49:44,320 --> 00:49:45,153
This guy has,

1844
00:49:45,160 --> 00:49:45,401
you know,

1845
00:49:45,401 --> 00:49:46,690
like you don't,

1846
00:49:46,860 --> 00:49:47,300
you know,

1847
00:49:47,300 --> 00:49:49,360
tweeting dessert require that much energy.

1848
00:49:50,590 --> 00:49:51,940
Like you're always like onto some,

1849
00:49:51,941 --> 00:49:52,310
fuck,

1850
00:49:52,310 --> 00:49:52,740
you're right.

1851
00:49:52,740 --> 00:49:55,780
Like always send some weird
island or traveling the world.

1852
00:49:55,781 --> 00:49:58,130
They're like at a comedy show or doing.

1853
00:49:58,660 --> 00:49:58,871
I'm like,

1854
00:49:58,871 --> 00:50:03,040
why does he have time to do Jujitsu for
fucking two hours a day to get a black

1855
00:50:03,041 --> 00:50:03,311
belt?

1856
00:50:03,311 --> 00:50:03,550
I'm like,

1857
00:50:03,550 --> 00:50:04,540
fuck man,

1858
00:50:04,610 --> 00:50:05,890
you just do it this way.

1859
00:50:06,130 --> 00:50:07,000
I could do a lot more.

1860
00:50:07,001 --> 00:50:07,730
I'm lazy.

1861
00:50:07,730 --> 00:50:09,880
This is a lot of shit that I
could be doing that I'm not doing.

1862
00:50:10,480 --> 00:50:11,560
But I like relaxing.

1863
00:50:11,830 --> 00:50:12,970
I like playing pool too.

1864
00:50:12,971 --> 00:50:13,990
I like doing a lot of shit.

1865
00:50:13,991 --> 00:50:15,040
It's not productive,

1866
00:50:15,880 --> 00:50:18,850
but the reason I have energy to do it,

1867
00:50:18,851 --> 00:50:20,290
it's cause it's all interesting shit.

1868
00:50:20,560 --> 00:50:23,590
Like if I'm retweeting something that
I read at two o'clock in the morning,

1869
00:50:23,591 --> 00:50:24,700
it's because it's cool.

1870
00:50:24,730 --> 00:50:25,580
Like it's interesting,

1871
00:50:25,900 --> 00:50:27,250
weird or it's disturbing.

1872
00:50:27,260 --> 00:50:27,681
Maybe.

1873
00:50:27,681 --> 00:50:28,040
Maybe

1874
00:50:28,040 --> 00:50:28,221
it's,

1875
00:50:28,221 --> 00:50:28,431
you know,

1876
00:50:28,431 --> 00:50:32,450
something I think requires discussion
or thought I just got to get more

1877
00:50:32,451 --> 00:50:32,871
interested.

1878
00:50:32,871 --> 00:50:34,280
I guess that's the problem.

1879
00:50:34,281 --> 00:50:35,690
And more interested in science.

1880
00:50:35,770 --> 00:50:36,160
I'm like,

1881
00:50:36,160 --> 00:50:36,441
Oh man,

1882
00:50:36,441 --> 00:50:38,510
I think I would know stuff
if I gave a fuck about that.

1883
00:50:39,300 --> 00:50:39,980
I'm like,

1884
00:50:39,980 --> 00:50:40,581
well right now,

1885
00:50:40,581 --> 00:50:41,060
you know,

1886
00:50:41,060 --> 00:50:41,421
you're,

1887
00:50:41,421 --> 00:50:43,550
you and I are in different
stages of our life too.

1888
00:50:43,551 --> 00:50:45,560
And you're in the stage of your
life where you're trying to,

1889
00:50:45,561 --> 00:50:45,801
you know,

1890
00:50:45,801 --> 00:50:47,540
make your name as a comic and you know,

1891
00:50:47,541 --> 00:50:50,370
you're hustling and trying to
put shit together and you got an,

1892
00:50:50,390 --> 00:50:51,890
you got no time for that nonsense.

1893
00:50:53,060 --> 00:50:55,070
Constantly out there trying to fucking

1894
00:50:55,220 --> 00:50:56,090
oh hustling man.

1895
00:50:56,091 --> 00:50:56,331
Like,

1896
00:50:56,331 --> 00:50:56,571
I mean,

1897
00:50:56,571 --> 00:51:00,590
literally I got back from Nevada
to an eight hour trip yesterday.

1898
00:51:00,860 --> 00:51:02,390
I got no car accidentally back.

1899
00:51:02,480 --> 00:51:04,820
I did three fucking three
sixties into the fucking bang,

1900
00:51:05,150 --> 00:51:06,620
got home and hit the wall,

1901
00:51:06,650 --> 00:51:11,060
got home coach wrestling at like three
at three o'clock from my middle school

1902
00:51:11,061 --> 00:51:11,601
wrestling team.

1903
00:51:11,601 --> 00:51:12,650
I coach with Einstein,

1904
00:51:12,651 --> 00:51:13,730
which is a blast,

1905
00:51:14,060 --> 00:51:14,893
but it's like,

1906
00:51:14,990 --> 00:51:16,190
like the other day in practice,

1907
00:51:16,550 --> 00:51:17,600
it's the inner city school.

1908
00:51:17,660 --> 00:51:17,990
I go,

1909
00:51:17,990 --> 00:51:18,321
hey guys,

1910
00:51:18,321 --> 00:51:19,250
we have practice tomorrow.

1911
00:51:19,430 --> 00:51:19,731
He goes,

1912
00:51:19,731 --> 00:51:20,121
I can't,

1913
00:51:20,121 --> 00:51:20,331
I'm like,

1914
00:51:20,331 --> 00:51:20,481
why?

1915
00:51:20,481 --> 00:51:20,660
He's like,

1916
00:51:20,660 --> 00:51:21,493
I have court.

1917
00:51:21,740 --> 00:51:24,240
I'm like fucking middle
school wrestling team.

1918
00:51:24,640 --> 00:51:24,921
I'm like,

1919
00:51:24,921 --> 00:51:25,870
what is wow.

1920
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:26,181
Yeah,

1921
00:51:26,181 --> 00:51:29,450
me or already me and Connor
hewn coached together.

1922
00:51:29,540 --> 00:51:30,250
Me and Connor.

1923
00:51:30,250 --> 00:51:32,420
Connor was the coach and now
I'm a coach up with Einstein.

1924
00:51:32,760 --> 00:51:33,490
Scott Epstein.

1925
00:51:33,490 --> 00:51:33,950
Nice.

1926
00:51:33,950 --> 00:51:34,580
Which is cool.

1927
00:51:34,580 --> 00:51:35,413
But um,

1928
00:51:35,900 --> 00:51:37,430
and then fucking came here.

1929
00:51:37,431 --> 00:51:37,941
It's like hustle.

1930
00:51:37,941 --> 00:51:38,774
And he's like,

1931
00:51:38,870 --> 00:51:39,220
but I was,

1932
00:51:39,220 --> 00:51:40,540
I feel like I was always hustling,

1933
00:51:40,541 --> 00:51:40,700
man.

1934
00:51:40,700 --> 00:51:43,250
Like 12 years ago I was giving out,

1935
00:51:43,660 --> 00:51:44,270
you know,

1936
00:51:44,270 --> 00:51:46,130
flyers in the street and Times Square,

1937
00:51:46,490 --> 00:51:48,350
begging people to come
to the comedy shows.

1938
00:51:48,410 --> 00:51:50,210
And that was an in laundromats performing,

1939
00:51:50,420 --> 00:51:51,253
you know,

1940
00:51:51,290 --> 00:51:53,750
and there was a was out
here and that New York City.

1941
00:51:53,930 --> 00:51:54,111
Oh,

1942
00:51:54,111 --> 00:51:55,060
you send Times Square.

1943
00:51:55,100 --> 00:51:55,780
Yeah.

1944
00:51:55,780 --> 00:51:56,613
Like here.

1945
00:51:57,530 --> 00:51:59,030
That's how much I'm paying
attention to right now.

1946
00:51:59,120 --> 00:51:59,953
Thank you man.

1947
00:52:00,490 --> 00:52:01,140
Just kidding.

1948
00:52:01,140 --> 00:52:03,040
Sorry ma'am.

1949
00:52:03,470 --> 00:52:03,860
Um,

1950
00:52:03,860 --> 00:52:04,250
the,

1951
00:52:04,250 --> 00:52:04,730
um,

1952
00:52:04,730 --> 00:52:09,110
that method of getting people in the
comedy clubs that actually works in New

1953
00:52:09,110 --> 00:52:09,210
York,

1954
00:52:09,210 --> 00:52:10,370
so many people are walking,

1955
00:52:10,400 --> 00:52:10,680
you know,

1956
00:52:10,680 --> 00:52:12,140
he can like hand them
flyers and they'll go,

1957
00:52:12,141 --> 00:52:12,501
fuck it.

1958
00:52:12,501 --> 00:52:15,050
We'll try like people that will
stand out in front of places.

1959
00:52:15,130 --> 00:52:15,400
I didn't,

1960
00:52:15,400 --> 00:52:15,580
dude.

1961
00:52:15,580 --> 00:52:16,840
I used to have it down packed.

1962
00:52:16,841 --> 00:52:17,040
Right.

1963
00:52:17,040 --> 00:52:18,370
See tourists look up and I'm like,

1964
00:52:18,371 --> 00:52:18,911
Fuck God.

1965
00:52:18,911 --> 00:52:19,331
I'm like,

1966
00:52:19,331 --> 00:52:20,164
as soon as they look up,

1967
00:52:20,180 --> 00:52:20,410
I'm like,

1968
00:52:20,410 --> 00:52:21,720
they're looking at wherever.

1969
00:52:21,730 --> 00:52:22,031
Got It.

1970
00:52:22,031 --> 00:52:23,710
And then I bring them
into the comedy show.

1971
00:52:23,980 --> 00:52:26,890
It'd be me and like the seven other
comedians that were giving out flyers.

1972
00:52:26,891 --> 00:52:27,641
So they look up,

1973
00:52:27,641 --> 00:52:30,640
they're looking for something to do
and then lying to everyone saying,

1974
00:52:30,670 --> 00:52:30,851
oh,

1975
00:52:30,851 --> 00:52:33,190
comics from MTV VH one common.

1976
00:52:33,370 --> 00:52:35,440
Meanwhile it's us giving
out the fucking fliers,

1977
00:52:35,470 --> 00:52:36,303
you know,

1978
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:38,020
then try and make them laugh.

1979
00:52:38,030 --> 00:52:39,170
Then as soon as you got to say,

1980
00:52:39,171 --> 00:52:39,491
and you're like,

1981
00:52:39,491 --> 00:52:41,050
that's the fucker gave
me the fucking flyer.

1982
00:52:41,860 --> 00:52:43,210
Like how funny is he?

1983
00:52:43,450 --> 00:52:46,660
And I would walk the half the half the
room to the entire room because of my,

1984
00:52:46,700 --> 00:52:50,020
if I was the dirtiest people were like
from Oregon or whatever except for the

1985
00:52:50,021 --> 00:52:53,650
two chicks that were hot and I get him
back to my room and smoke weed and try to

1986
00:52:53,651 --> 00:52:54,484
bang them.

1987
00:52:56,060 --> 00:52:56,691
I remember,

1988
00:52:56,691 --> 00:52:57,020
uh,

1989
00:52:57,020 --> 00:52:58,370
in the early days of comedy,

1990
00:52:58,371 --> 00:53:00,410
a dude's always had fake credits.

1991
00:53:01,070 --> 00:53:04,550
Like you've seen this guy
and MTVs half hour comedy.

1992
00:53:04,590 --> 00:53:05,450
I know you hadn't,

1993
00:53:05,780 --> 00:53:06,980
he hadn't been on that shit.

1994
00:53:07,970 --> 00:53:11,180
But to say that just saying
that made a bar and you know,

1995
00:53:11,181 --> 00:53:12,014
Andover,

1996
00:53:12,200 --> 00:53:14,210
Massachusetts way through except it.

1997
00:53:14,240 --> 00:53:14,900
Okay,

1998
00:53:14,900 --> 00:53:15,910
guys been on MTV.

1999
00:53:15,920 --> 00:53:16,760
Let's see what he's got.

2000
00:53:17,180 --> 00:53:17,870
Exactly.

2001
00:53:17,870 --> 00:53:18,260
Yeah.

2002
00:53:18,260 --> 00:53:21,410
The one time I was plunging the toilets
at New York comedy club to get on stage

2003
00:53:21,740 --> 00:53:22,620
and the,

2004
00:53:22,940 --> 00:53:24,800
it was like a prom show or after the prom,

2005
00:53:24,801 --> 00:53:25,230
like they,

2006
00:53:25,230 --> 00:53:27,360
the kids to the comedy club and uh,

2007
00:53:27,720 --> 00:53:29,610
and all the comics left
because the PR then was late.

2008
00:53:29,790 --> 00:53:30,331
So Ozzy,

2009
00:53:30,331 --> 00:53:30,931
this Guy Ozzie,

2010
00:53:30,931 --> 00:53:31,170
he goes,

2011
00:53:31,170 --> 00:53:31,891
how much time do you do?

2012
00:53:31,891 --> 00:53:32,131
I'm like,

2013
00:53:32,131 --> 00:53:32,820
two minutes.

2014
00:53:32,820 --> 00:53:35,040
Can you do 45 sure.

2015
00:53:35,100 --> 00:53:35,700
You know,

2016
00:53:35,700 --> 00:53:36,010
and then,

2017
00:53:36,010 --> 00:53:36,300
then,

2018
00:53:36,300 --> 00:53:36,600
then,

2019
00:53:36,600 --> 00:53:38,890
then I'm back there and
then the guy goes comics.

2020
00:53:39,070 --> 00:53:41,040
That's Comedians from MTV VH one.

2021
00:53:41,041 --> 00:53:41,671
I'm looking around like,

2022
00:53:41,671 --> 00:53:42,421
who the fuck is here?

2023
00:53:42,421 --> 00:53:44,310
They're like Adam Greenberg.

2024
00:53:44,420 --> 00:53:45,151
That's my real name.

2025
00:53:45,151 --> 00:53:45,930
Cause almost like,

2026
00:53:45,930 --> 00:53:48,120
so then I fucking walk up there and uh,

2027
00:53:48,240 --> 00:53:51,630
and do 45 minutes for these funds to
change her name from Greenberg to hunter.

2028
00:53:52,160 --> 00:53:52,993
Uh,

2029
00:53:53,220 --> 00:53:53,610
well,

2030
00:53:53,610 --> 00:53:55,290
because hunter is not a Douchey last name,

2031
00:53:55,291 --> 00:53:57,840
unless you call yourself a hunter.

2032
00:53:58,070 --> 00:53:58,903
It is,

2033
00:53:58,970 --> 00:53:59,430
it gets,

2034
00:53:59,430 --> 00:54:00,230
it gets tricky.

2035
00:54:00,230 --> 00:54:00,740
Well,

2036
00:54:00,740 --> 00:54:01,431
I'll tell you why.

2037
00:54:01,431 --> 00:54:02,540
It's actually a story there.

2038
00:54:02,600 --> 00:54:03,950
It's actually a real story
and it's going to be,

2039
00:54:04,280 --> 00:54:05,300
this is kind of sad actually.

2040
00:54:05,880 --> 00:54:06,211
Dude,

2041
00:54:06,211 --> 00:54:07,140
you bum me out again.

2042
00:54:07,170 --> 00:54:09,510
Fuck them for those.

2043
00:54:09,511 --> 00:54:09,901
At home,

2044
00:54:09,901 --> 00:54:10,530
we're playing.

2045
00:54:10,530 --> 00:54:11,010
Okay,

2046
00:54:11,010 --> 00:54:12,780
we're buddies joking around.

2047
00:54:13,260 --> 00:54:14,570
I'm not going to say fuck
me until I get into that.

2048
00:54:14,580 --> 00:54:15,330
Let me back up my car.

2049
00:54:15,330 --> 00:54:20,280
And I didn't really say is times square
or round here because I was thinking of

2050
00:54:20,281 --> 00:54:21,300
something that was my,

2051
00:54:21,390 --> 00:54:22,500
I wasn't really shitting on them.

2052
00:54:23,060 --> 00:54:23,860
That was fake.

2053
00:54:23,860 --> 00:54:25,370
So a hunter.

2054
00:54:25,400 --> 00:54:26,000
So anyway,

2055
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:26,870
I used to work,

2056
00:54:26,900 --> 00:54:30,290
I work at the volunteer at the Ronald
McDonald House for three years in New

2057
00:54:30,290 --> 00:54:30,320
York.

2058
00:54:30,320 --> 00:54:31,370
I was like the head volunteer.

2059
00:54:31,371 --> 00:54:33,380
I'd make them all laugh and I bring dates.

2060
00:54:33,381 --> 00:54:34,214
Actually it was good way.

2061
00:54:34,250 --> 00:54:34,480
No,

2062
00:54:34,480 --> 00:54:36,800
but I will once in a while I bring a girl,

2063
00:54:36,801 --> 00:54:37,101
but not,

2064
00:54:37,101 --> 00:54:37,891
that was not why I did it.

2065
00:54:37,891 --> 00:54:38,140
Yeah,

2066
00:54:38,140 --> 00:54:39,010
that would be impressive.

2067
00:54:39,370 --> 00:54:40,030
You know,

2068
00:54:40,030 --> 00:54:41,200
you did a show there.

2069
00:54:41,290 --> 00:54:41,441
Well,

2070
00:54:41,441 --> 00:54:41,561
yeah,

2071
00:54:41,561 --> 00:54:42,990
we did shows for the kids and working on,

2072
00:54:43,130 --> 00:54:43,660
she would think,

2073
00:54:43,660 --> 00:54:44,021
oh my God,

2074
00:54:44,021 --> 00:54:44,890
he's so sweet.

2075
00:54:44,891 --> 00:54:44,960
Yeah,

2076
00:54:44,960 --> 00:54:45,390
exactly.

2077
00:54:45,390 --> 00:54:46,071
The one time though,

2078
00:54:46,071 --> 00:54:47,000
it backfire because,

2079
00:54:47,001 --> 00:54:47,420
uh,

2080
00:54:47,420 --> 00:54:50,870
I brought my ex girlfriend and she's like
this little girl who had like cancer.

2081
00:54:50,871 --> 00:54:51,411
It was like five.

2082
00:54:51,411 --> 00:54:51,980
She was like,

2083
00:54:51,980 --> 00:54:52,281
Oh,

2084
00:54:52,281 --> 00:54:52,670
I'm okay.

2085
00:54:52,670 --> 00:54:53,740
This is my friend who was,

2086
00:54:54,050 --> 00:54:54,750
uh,

2087
00:54:54,750 --> 00:54:55,200
uh,

2088
00:54:55,200 --> 00:54:57,020
you're not as pretty as the
girl Adam brought last week.

2089
00:54:57,700 --> 00:54:58,533
Oh

2090
00:54:59,620 --> 00:55:00,453
No.

2091
00:55:00,490 --> 00:55:01,021
I was like,

2092
00:55:01,021 --> 00:55:01,801
you fucking cock.

2093
00:55:01,801 --> 00:55:03,120
Oh my God.

2094
00:55:03,150 --> 00:55:05,040
But that was wow.

2095
00:55:05,340 --> 00:55:07,230
That was like one of the
best times of my life.

2096
00:55:07,231 --> 00:55:08,010
Those kids were awesome.

2097
00:55:08,010 --> 00:55:08,760
But the one kid,

2098
00:55:08,760 --> 00:55:11,040
his name is hunter and it's by my dad.

2099
00:55:11,070 --> 00:55:15,300
My Dad kept telling me that everyone
hates Jews in Hollywood and that everybody

2100
00:55:15,880 --> 00:55:18,120
and that I'm never going to make,

2101
00:55:18,340 --> 00:55:19,470
and I'm never gonna make it.

2102
00:55:19,740 --> 00:55:23,730
My last name's Greenberg because people
that don't want to see a big office box

2103
00:55:23,731 --> 00:55:24,480
office guy,

2104
00:55:24,480 --> 00:55:25,530
you don't see Brad Pitt.

2105
00:55:25,560 --> 00:55:26,393
You don't see you,

2106
00:55:26,400 --> 00:55:28,200
you know Tom Cruise and Adam Greenberg.

2107
00:55:28,210 --> 00:55:29,250
You've got to change it to something.

2108
00:55:29,270 --> 00:55:30,600
And so then that finally I was like,

2109
00:55:30,630 --> 00:55:31,463
all right,

2110
00:55:31,590 --> 00:55:32,700
I'll fucking change my name.

2111
00:55:32,730 --> 00:55:33,511
And so I was like,

2112
00:55:33,511 --> 00:55:33,931
you know what?

2113
00:55:33,931 --> 00:55:34,800
This kid is my best.

2114
00:55:35,300 --> 00:55:38,730
I'm like his best friend and it will
always remind me of a good time in my life

2115
00:55:39,060 --> 00:55:39,893
with these kids.

2116
00:55:39,930 --> 00:55:41,040
So I changed it to hunter.

2117
00:55:41,220 --> 00:55:41,870
Oh,

2118
00:55:41,870 --> 00:55:42,740
that's very sweet.

2119
00:55:42,770 --> 00:55:44,180
That's what that is a sweet story.

2120
00:55:44,780 --> 00:55:45,081
But,

2121
00:55:45,081 --> 00:55:45,350
uh,

2122
00:55:45,350 --> 00:55:47,060
I think you would have
been fine with Greenberg.

2123
00:55:47,360 --> 00:55:50,690
I think so too early in the world of
stand out it was like the dumb and crazy

2124
00:55:50,691 --> 00:55:51,740
and then like a month later on,

2125
00:55:51,741 --> 00:55:53,390
my dad was a stupid as day.

2126
00:55:53,930 --> 00:55:55,050
The Jews are going to be upset.

2127
00:55:55,360 --> 00:55:57,220
You don't claim them well,

2128
00:55:57,230 --> 00:55:57,820
you know,

2129
00:55:57,820 --> 00:55:58,121
I mean,

2130
00:55:58,121 --> 00:55:58,880
you know,

2131
00:55:58,880 --> 00:56:02,060
like I had Italian people that
were upset that my name is Rogan.

2132
00:56:02,600 --> 00:56:02,811
They're like,

2133
00:56:02,811 --> 00:56:03,644
I thought you were telling him.

2134
00:56:03,890 --> 00:56:04,251
I'm like,

2135
00:56:04,251 --> 00:56:05,450
I'm mostly Italian,

2136
00:56:05,480 --> 00:56:06,140
but my,

2137
00:56:06,140 --> 00:56:08,000
my Irish grandfather,

2138
00:56:08,001 --> 00:56:08,421
that's how it was.

2139
00:56:08,421 --> 00:56:08,871
His name,

2140
00:56:08,871 --> 00:56:09,231
Rogan.

2141
00:56:09,231 --> 00:56:10,280
That's where it comes from.

2142
00:56:10,370 --> 00:56:11,203
So it's like,

2143
00:56:11,480 --> 00:56:14,060
it's like one quarter of that
and three quarters Italian.

2144
00:56:14,300 --> 00:56:16,700
But the fact that they can't claim you,

2145
00:56:16,960 --> 00:56:17,210
well I,

2146
00:56:17,210 --> 00:56:20,470
I don't think they will try
to claim me Jews very upset.

2147
00:56:20,471 --> 00:56:23,910
You're not claiming this
claiming that my am Jewish.

2148
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:26,370
So you were worried about Greenberg?

2149
00:56:26,400 --> 00:56:26,791
I was growing up,

2150
00:56:26,791 --> 00:56:27,690
my dad actually,

2151
00:56:29,060 --> 00:56:29,820
and anytime,

2152
00:56:29,820 --> 00:56:30,640
like if we get into fights,

2153
00:56:30,640 --> 00:56:31,650
like I should have been published,

2154
00:56:31,710 --> 00:56:32,190
Greenberg,

2155
00:56:32,190 --> 00:56:33,023
I'd be famous by now.

2156
00:56:34,510 --> 00:56:38,430
So I always had kind of had
that overall know hilarious.

2157
00:56:38,431 --> 00:56:41,280
What I did it for the opposite
reason because a rifle,

2158
00:56:41,460 --> 00:56:41,701
you know,

2159
00:56:41,701 --> 00:56:43,250
like third Reichel yeah,

2160
00:56:44,380 --> 00:56:45,213
right.

2161
00:56:45,560 --> 00:56:46,351
Ben To write cold.

2162
00:56:46,351 --> 00:56:50,210
It makes sense because you
know you had that name just as,

2163
00:56:50,250 --> 00:56:55,250
because it's the band that goes x rated
or r rated movies that to let you know

2164
00:56:56,841 --> 00:56:58,980
that dirty shit's about to happen though.

2165
00:56:59,210 --> 00:57:00,043
Yeah.

2166
00:57:00,350 --> 00:57:00,741
So,

2167
00:57:00,741 --> 00:57:00,870
uh,

2168
00:57:00,870 --> 00:57:01,703
that made sense.

2169
00:57:01,760 --> 00:57:02,170
Right.

2170
00:57:02,170 --> 00:57:02,900
But yeah,

2171
00:57:02,900 --> 00:57:03,720
Greenberg

2172
00:57:03,720 --> 00:57:04,251
I know,

2173
00:57:04,251 --> 00:57:05,084
I know.

2174
00:57:05,590 --> 00:57:05,970
I know.

2175
00:57:05,970 --> 00:57:06,900
My nickname was greeny.

2176
00:57:07,730 --> 00:57:09,240
Does cool nickname.

2177
00:57:09,241 --> 00:57:10,110
You lost your identity.

2178
00:57:10,440 --> 00:57:11,273
Fuck man.

2179
00:57:11,310 --> 00:57:11,940
I know.

2180
00:57:11,940 --> 00:57:13,200
Well no I don't,

2181
00:57:13,350 --> 00:57:14,400
I still have my identity.

2182
00:57:14,401 --> 00:57:15,660
I'm still happy with who I am.

2183
00:57:16,330 --> 00:57:17,410
It's a cute name.

2184
00:57:17,440 --> 00:57:17,960
Uh,

2185
00:57:17,960 --> 00:57:20,710
when you think about the story behind it.

2186
00:57:20,780 --> 00:57:21,090
Yeah.

2187
00:57:21,090 --> 00:57:21,923
What's,

2188
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:23,800
what's and last comic
standing shouldn't so cute.

2189
00:57:24,260 --> 00:57:26,660
That's kind of saying they kept trying
to get me to tell that story and I

2190
00:57:26,661 --> 00:57:27,494
wouldn't tell it

2191
00:57:27,950 --> 00:57:29,160
she did for this podcast.

2192
00:57:29,320 --> 00:57:29,610
Well,

2193
00:57:29,610 --> 00:57:30,151
cause I was like,

2194
00:57:30,151 --> 00:57:32,760
they wanted me to be like vote for me
and then hold up a picture of the kid and

2195
00:57:32,761 --> 00:57:33,140
I was like,

2196
00:57:33,140 --> 00:57:33,973
wow.

2197
00:57:34,280 --> 00:57:34,980
It's like,

2198
00:57:34,980 --> 00:57:35,490
oh man.

2199
00:57:35,490 --> 00:57:35,851
I was like,

2200
00:57:35,851 --> 00:57:36,091
no,

2201
00:57:36,091 --> 00:57:36,924
I can't,

2202
00:57:37,110 --> 00:57:37,740
can I do that?

2203
00:57:37,740 --> 00:57:38,460
Like,

2204
00:57:38,460 --> 00:57:38,970
I was like,

2205
00:57:38,970 --> 00:57:39,630
I can't,

2206
00:57:39,630 --> 00:57:42,300
you know who's who was
producing that show?

2207
00:57:42,390 --> 00:57:42,901
I don't know.

2208
00:57:42,901 --> 00:57:43,671
I mean it was a,

2209
00:57:43,671 --> 00:57:45,630
I was happy it showed their life for me.

2210
00:57:45,670 --> 00:57:46,190
I went,

2211
00:57:46,190 --> 00:57:47,580
I went from feature to call feature

2212
00:57:51,070 --> 00:57:51,930
add a month.

2213
00:57:52,010 --> 00:57:52,800
He'll be here all week.

2214
00:57:52,800 --> 00:57:53,850
It's what is,

2215
00:57:54,030 --> 00:57:55,170
what is it like doing those,

2216
00:57:55,171 --> 00:57:55,590
um,

2217
00:57:55,590 --> 00:57:56,430
those boats?

2218
00:57:56,940 --> 00:57:57,091
Oh,

2219
00:57:57,091 --> 00:57:57,541
the ships.

2220
00:57:57,541 --> 00:57:58,374
Cruise ship.

2221
00:57:58,820 --> 00:57:59,160
It's,

2222
00:57:59,160 --> 00:57:59,910
you know what,

2223
00:57:59,910 --> 00:58:01,200
like I have a girlfriend,

2224
00:58:01,201 --> 00:58:04,230
so it kind of sucks because like
literally if you want to get,

2225
00:58:04,290 --> 00:58:04,770
I like,

2226
00:58:04,770 --> 00:58:07,710
it's like the pussy you can get,

2227
00:58:07,860 --> 00:58:08,441
that's what it looks like.

2228
00:58:08,441 --> 00:58:10,410
Him fucking bang that the passengers.

2229
00:58:10,600 --> 00:58:11,000
But,

2230
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:11,880
but it says like,

2231
00:58:12,030 --> 00:58:13,850
but you could fuck the
staff and it's awful.

2232
00:58:13,860 --> 00:58:17,040
Like the massage girls and like the
dancers and you come in as the comic and

2233
00:58:17,041 --> 00:58:19,440
then they get the guests all fucking
surround you after the shows.

2234
00:58:19,440 --> 00:58:19,920
They're like,

2235
00:58:19,920 --> 00:58:20,753
ah,

2236
00:58:20,910 --> 00:58:21,240
that's,

2237
00:58:21,240 --> 00:58:21,570
that's,

2238
00:58:21,570 --> 00:58:22,410
that's the good part.

2239
00:58:22,470 --> 00:58:27,180
And like the good part is sometimes I'll
be like in Aruba or Cancun or part of

2240
00:58:27,181 --> 00:58:31,400
my art there and in the fucking ocean at
like noon that everyone paid thousands

2241
00:58:31,401 --> 00:58:31,521
of that.

2242
00:58:31,521 --> 00:58:31,891
And I'm like,

2243
00:58:31,891 --> 00:58:32,970
I'm getting paid for this.

2244
00:58:33,300 --> 00:58:34,230
This is fucking awesome.

2245
00:58:34,231 --> 00:58:35,160
So that's the good part.

2246
00:58:35,220 --> 00:58:36,820
And the shows 300 people every,

2247
00:58:36,821 --> 00:58:37,654
every single show,

2248
00:58:37,680 --> 00:58:38,260
you know,

2249
00:58:38,260 --> 00:58:38,650
and,

2250
00:58:38,650 --> 00:58:40,050
and five shows every two days.

2251
00:58:40,230 --> 00:58:41,220
And the money's fucking great.

2252
00:58:42,450 --> 00:58:43,141
That's the good part.

2253
00:58:43,141 --> 00:58:45,120
The bad part is that is that,

2254
00:58:45,350 --> 00:58:45,900
you know,

2255
00:58:45,900 --> 00:58:47,880
the same crowd comes to every single show.

2256
00:58:48,270 --> 00:58:49,530
So you gotta do five shows.

2257
00:58:49,830 --> 00:58:52,280
So like I didn't got to
do five 30 different,

2258
00:58:52,560 --> 00:58:54,080
30 minute shows different cause like

2259
00:58:54,250 --> 00:58:54,981
doing different joke,

2260
00:58:54,981 --> 00:58:56,230
true doing different jokes.

2261
00:58:56,240 --> 00:58:57,073
Right.

2262
00:59:00,180 --> 00:59:03,170
It's just you up there like the lady goes,

2263
00:59:03,420 --> 00:59:05,070
give it up for out of
butter and then you go up,

2264
00:59:05,100 --> 00:59:05,700
there's no like,

2265
00:59:05,700 --> 00:59:06,280
you know,

2266
00:59:06,280 --> 00:59:06,460
blah,

2267
00:59:06,460 --> 00:59:06,601
blah,

2268
00:59:06,601 --> 00:59:06,811
blah,

2269
00:59:06,811 --> 00:59:07,410
blah blah.

2270
00:59:07,410 --> 00:59:10,320
And one fund company or me
and my girlfriend broke up
for like a week one time.

2271
00:59:10,321 --> 00:59:11,154
And uh,

2272
00:59:11,250 --> 00:59:11,991
and I hooked up with it.

2273
00:59:11,991 --> 00:59:13,800
Like the chick that did that and I'm like,

2274
00:59:13,801 --> 00:59:14,550
give it up for,

2275
00:59:14,550 --> 00:59:14,811
for,

2276
00:59:14,811 --> 00:59:15,060
uh,

2277
00:59:15,060 --> 00:59:15,300
you know,

2278
00:59:15,300 --> 00:59:15,840
Jennifer,

2279
00:59:15,840 --> 00:59:17,040
she gets the best blowjobs in the shoe.

2280
00:59:17,041 --> 00:59:17,160
Shit.

2281
00:59:17,160 --> 00:59:17,430
It was like,

2282
00:59:17,430 --> 00:59:18,060
oh,

2283
00:59:18,060 --> 00:59:21,090
well she really was giving me
the best books on how rude.

2284
00:59:21,280 --> 00:59:22,113
Yeah.

2285
00:59:22,150 --> 00:59:22,391
All right.

2286
00:59:22,391 --> 00:59:23,170
Maybe it wasn't that funny.

2287
00:59:23,170 --> 00:59:23,560
Okay.

2288
00:59:23,560 --> 00:59:24,260
But uh,

2289
00:59:24,260 --> 00:59:25,440
no for Jennifer wasn't.

2290
00:59:25,450 --> 00:59:25,740
Yeah,

2291
00:59:25,740 --> 00:59:26,590
that wasn't her real name.

2292
00:59:26,610 --> 00:59:27,443
I changed her name.

2293
00:59:27,930 --> 00:59:28,763
Um,

2294
00:59:29,470 --> 00:59:30,191
she was laughing,

2295
00:59:30,191 --> 00:59:31,180
shake your head and be like,

2296
00:59:31,181 --> 00:59:32,014
oh Jesus.

2297
00:59:32,120 --> 00:59:32,953
Oh,

2298
00:59:33,020 --> 00:59:33,760
Oh Adam.

2299
00:59:33,760 --> 00:59:37,720
But boy they break dancers
are the ones that clean house.

2300
00:59:37,721 --> 00:59:39,640
Those guys get all the
fucking break dancers.

2301
00:59:39,680 --> 00:59:39,840
Yeah.

2302
00:59:39,840 --> 00:59:43,580
Cause they're with the guests all day
long and teaching him how to La on a dance

2303
00:59:43,581 --> 00:59:44,590
and it's all cougars.

2304
00:59:44,670 --> 00:59:45,780
Oh.

2305
00:59:46,020 --> 00:59:47,770
Oh that's hilarious.

2306
00:59:48,280 --> 00:59:52,000
This like a whole ecosystem on a boat.

2307
00:59:52,160 --> 00:59:53,710
Like the Filipinos and the Indians,

2308
00:59:53,711 --> 00:59:54,640
they put on the bottom,

2309
00:59:54,670 --> 00:59:55,870
the Italians and the top,

2310
00:59:56,170 --> 00:59:56,590
the middle.

2311
00:59:56,590 --> 00:59:58,840
They get the best view cause
they're part of the Italian navy.

2312
00:59:58,841 --> 00:59:59,860
It's like a whole,

2313
01:00:00,430 --> 01:00:02,020
it's a wow.

2314
01:00:02,110 --> 01:00:02,291
No.

2315
01:00:02,291 --> 01:00:07,120
Did you freak out when that one
boat hit the fucking rocks in Italy?

2316
01:00:07,121 --> 01:00:07,954
And

2317
01:00:08,980 --> 01:00:09,510
that happened in,

2318
01:00:09,510 --> 01:00:10,330
uh,

2319
01:00:10,330 --> 01:00:11,290
I forgot where that was,

2320
01:00:11,291 --> 01:00:12,310
but that was pretty crazy.

2321
01:00:12,580 --> 01:00:12,791
Yeah.

2322
01:00:12,791 --> 01:00:16,450
When those people died then the guy did
it cause he was trying to show off to

2323
01:00:16,451 --> 01:00:19,900
his girlfriend and then get closer
and then he didn't show up to,

2324
01:00:19,901 --> 01:00:20,830
well moron.

2325
01:00:20,860 --> 01:00:22,540
What a crazy fuck.

2326
01:00:22,910 --> 01:00:24,550
He and he and he like left the boat.

2327
01:00:24,570 --> 01:00:25,540
And I slept everyone else.

2328
01:00:25,780 --> 01:00:26,201
But anyway,

2329
01:00:26,201 --> 01:00:26,810
back to the,

2330
01:00:26,810 --> 01:00:27,790
the happiness,

2331
01:00:27,791 --> 01:00:28,624
the cruises.

2332
01:00:28,630 --> 01:00:33,460
It's so easy to get like
pussy on it because the guests
are all like surrounding

2333
01:00:33,461 --> 01:00:34,990
you and you're like the star or the ship.

2334
01:00:35,530 --> 01:00:35,981
And then,

2335
01:00:35,981 --> 01:00:36,520
uh,

2336
01:00:36,520 --> 01:00:37,420
I like went downstairs.

2337
01:00:37,780 --> 01:00:39,730
I'm like beating off angrily in my room.

2338
01:00:39,970 --> 01:00:40,803
Don't be angry.

2339
01:00:43,010 --> 01:00:43,351
Why?

2340
01:00:43,351 --> 01:00:44,890
Why are you beating off angrily?

2341
01:00:44,920 --> 01:00:47,240
Because I wanted to bang
the chicks and I'm faithful.

2342
01:00:47,470 --> 01:00:50,710
It's why the anger like fuck man,

2343
01:00:50,711 --> 01:00:51,730
shut the fuck those shakes.

2344
01:00:51,731 --> 01:00:51,911
Like,

2345
01:00:51,911 --> 01:00:52,744
I don't know.

2346
01:00:53,050 --> 01:00:53,740
It's really put,

2347
01:00:53,740 --> 01:00:55,960
shouldn't put angry and
fucking killer like that.

2348
01:00:56,050 --> 01:00:57,590
Just try to keep them out of your head.

2349
01:00:57,640 --> 01:00:58,473
I'm sorry dude.

2350
01:00:58,680 --> 01:01:00,850
I mean that's how I,

2351
01:01:00,851 --> 01:01:03,310
that's what I wished my vocab but
there is better but that's what,

2352
01:01:03,311 --> 01:01:06,010
those are the words going through
my head as I'm just fucking with it.

2353
01:01:06,011 --> 01:01:07,090
You can't get porn on the shit.

2354
01:01:07,100 --> 01:01:07,933
That's the hard part.

2355
01:01:07,960 --> 01:01:08,800
No porn at all.

2356
01:01:08,830 --> 01:01:09,011
No,

2357
01:01:09,011 --> 01:01:09,970
they blocked the porn.

2358
01:01:09,971 --> 01:01:10,804
It's just like,

2359
01:01:11,050 --> 01:01:11,141
oh,

2360
01:01:11,141 --> 01:01:11,974
that's so silly.

2361
01:01:12,290 --> 01:01:13,150
How do they block?

2362
01:01:13,151 --> 01:01:15,430
It just says like this act,

2363
01:01:15,431 --> 01:01:17,740
this website is blocked porn,

2364
01:01:17,770 --> 01:01:18,603
right?

2365
01:01:18,850 --> 01:01:21,370
Nobody has like hard copy anymore.

2366
01:01:21,580 --> 01:01:25,300
Everything is a youporn and
put the cruises are funny.

2367
01:01:25,320 --> 01:01:25,470
Like,

2368
01:01:25,470 --> 01:01:27,460
cause they have like special
people go on the cruises.

2369
01:01:27,460 --> 01:01:28,930
Like I did the boys to men crews.

2370
01:01:29,230 --> 01:01:31,330
Like they were on the ship rewarming yeah.

2371
01:01:31,660 --> 01:01:32,493
And then uh,

2372
01:01:32,530 --> 01:01:34,240
like Richard Simmons has a cruise,

2373
01:01:35,080 --> 01:01:36,190
but he only brings like,

2374
01:01:37,180 --> 01:01:39,340
you only brings like a
couple hundred people.

2375
01:01:39,370 --> 01:01:40,203
Um,

2376
01:01:40,740 --> 01:01:41,020
and it,

2377
01:01:41,020 --> 01:01:41,711
but the rest of the cruise,

2378
01:01:41,711 --> 01:01:45,910
if regular people to a crew
sounds like it could be madness.

2379
01:01:45,940 --> 01:01:46,810
And then he gets up,

2380
01:01:46,811 --> 01:01:47,910
starts dancing at breakfast.

2381
01:01:47,940 --> 01:01:49,750
All these fat people start
getting up and dancing,

2382
01:01:49,990 --> 01:01:50,823
but they're the ones,

2383
01:01:50,860 --> 01:01:52,840
not everyone is there for
the Richard Simmons crews.

2384
01:01:52,900 --> 01:01:53,441
So people are like,

2385
01:01:53,441 --> 01:01:55,510
why the fuck are these fat
people dancing right now?

2386
01:01:56,230 --> 01:01:56,650
And like,

2387
01:01:56,650 --> 01:01:57,260
oh no,

2388
01:01:57,260 --> 01:01:57,700
no,

2389
01:01:57,700 --> 01:01:58,001
no,

2390
01:01:58,001 --> 01:01:58,181
no,

2391
01:01:58,181 --> 01:01:58,740
no.

2392
01:01:58,740 --> 01:02:00,550
It's not the whole boat.

2393
01:02:00,670 --> 01:02:00,911
No,

2394
01:02:00,911 --> 01:02:01,780
it's like half the boats.

2395
01:02:02,230 --> 01:02:02,771
And people were like,

2396
01:02:02,771 --> 01:02:03,640
is that Richard Simmons?

2397
01:02:03,760 --> 01:02:05,170
Is that like fuck.

2398
01:02:05,280 --> 01:02:06,500
Could imagine

2399
01:02:06,530 --> 01:02:07,131
if you like,

2400
01:02:07,131 --> 01:02:08,630
we're going to go on vacation,

2401
01:02:08,631 --> 01:02:09,920
we're going to go on a nice boat.

2402
01:02:10,120 --> 01:02:13,580
I'm gonna sit back where a cocktail
and no one's going to bother me.

2403
01:02:13,940 --> 01:02:14,421
This is it.

2404
01:02:14,421 --> 01:02:15,430
I got a nice [inaudible].

2405
01:02:16,040 --> 01:02:17,510
I worked hard for this moment.

2406
01:02:17,900 --> 01:02:20,920
And you're sitting out there with your
bathrobe on when you're fucking slippers

2407
01:02:21,610 --> 01:02:25,720
and it's just a sea of giant women dance

2408
01:02:26,770 --> 01:02:27,603
the case

2409
01:02:29,250 --> 01:02:32,320
and the gay dancing in
front of you every day

2410
01:02:33,390 --> 01:02:36,370
the women are crying and
everyone's emotional.

2411
01:02:36,930 --> 01:02:38,110
They're hugging it out,

2412
01:02:38,111 --> 01:02:41,760
everyone's talking get out
after class and it's ridiculous.

2413
01:02:41,770 --> 01:02:42,650
You're transfixed.

2414
01:02:43,620 --> 01:02:44,160
Uh,

2415
01:02:44,160 --> 01:02:45,570
I've had people try to fight me like,

2416
01:02:45,571 --> 01:02:45,990
uh,

2417
01:02:45,990 --> 01:02:46,231
on the,

2418
01:02:46,231 --> 01:02:49,350
on the boat will not fight me.

2419
01:02:49,351 --> 01:02:52,650
But like one time I was on stage and
this woman was going to the bathroom and

2420
01:02:52,651 --> 01:02:53,371
she was a lesbian,

2421
01:02:53,371 --> 01:02:54,041
but I didn't know that.

2422
01:02:54,041 --> 01:02:54,481
So I was like,

2423
01:02:54,481 --> 01:02:56,670
what are you going to change
that change a tire or something.

2424
01:02:56,970 --> 01:02:57,571
And then she's like,

2425
01:02:57,571 --> 01:02:58,351
give me the microphone.

2426
01:02:58,351 --> 01:03:01,650
So she runs up and I'm holding it
above my head and she's jumping for it.

2427
01:03:02,160 --> 01:03:03,260
And I was like,

2428
01:03:03,610 --> 01:03:04,560
the crowds laughing.

2429
01:03:04,570 --> 01:03:05,100
I'm like,

2430
01:03:05,100 --> 01:03:05,281
well,

2431
01:03:05,281 --> 01:03:06,480
you can tell she's not good with Cox.

2432
01:03:06,481 --> 01:03:07,330
He kept grabbing the microphone.

2433
01:03:07,331 --> 01:03:07,921
You know what I'm saying?

2434
01:03:07,921 --> 01:03:09,210
Whatever sticks out in my head.

2435
01:03:09,420 --> 01:03:10,680
It turns out she was a lesbian.

2436
01:03:10,880 --> 01:03:11,250
She was,

2437
01:03:11,250 --> 01:03:12,180
and she was having fun.

2438
01:03:12,210 --> 01:03:13,500
He could go get wasted on these ships.

2439
01:03:13,560 --> 01:03:13,741
I mean,

2440
01:03:13,741 --> 01:03:14,940
you get like wasting,

2441
01:03:15,450 --> 01:03:15,930
you know,

2442
01:03:15,930 --> 01:03:16,291
so that's,

2443
01:03:16,291 --> 01:03:16,491
it's,

2444
01:03:16,491 --> 01:03:17,071
it's good.

2445
01:03:17,071 --> 01:03:17,580
I mean,

2446
01:03:17,580 --> 01:03:17,941
yeah,

2447
01:03:17,941 --> 01:03:18,774
right.

2448
01:03:18,900 --> 01:03:20,370
But when they go on vacation,

2449
01:03:20,910 --> 01:03:21,420
they just,

2450
01:03:21,420 --> 01:03:22,500
they go too far,

2451
01:03:22,501 --> 01:03:24,150
but you get too drunk.

2452
01:03:24,420 --> 01:03:26,760
Some people were just
so excited to get drunk.

2453
01:03:27,450 --> 01:03:31,200
They're just so excited to just
fucking a wash it away for a few days.

2454
01:03:31,930 --> 01:03:32,763
Oh yeah,

2455
01:03:33,520 --> 01:03:34,041
absolutely.

2456
01:03:34,041 --> 01:03:34,520
I mean,

2457
01:03:34,520 --> 01:03:37,480
I see people go crazy
on the three 11 ship.

2458
01:03:37,510 --> 01:03:38,500
Someone jumped off it.

2459
01:03:38,920 --> 01:03:43,110
What's a three 11 shit when like the
three 11 performed the band yet they had a

2460
01:03:43,111 --> 01:03:46,300
cruise that they all have their own crews
and someone jumped off the boat yeah.

2461
01:03:46,301 --> 01:03:46,780
To like,

2462
01:03:46,780 --> 01:03:49,660
cause then Jamaica like 50 miles
out or something so I could make it,

2463
01:03:49,720 --> 01:03:51,010
oh no he didn't.

2464
01:03:51,430 --> 01:03:53,550
He tried to swim 50 fucking miles.

2465
01:03:53,890 --> 01:03:54,910
Oh my God.

2466
01:03:54,911 --> 01:03:55,780
So what did they do?

2467
01:03:55,990 --> 01:03:56,381
He'd be like,

2468
01:03:56,381 --> 01:03:57,860
broke his arm and he had to go rescue him.

2469
01:03:57,900 --> 01:03:59,290
Oh my God.

2470
01:03:59,410 --> 01:04:00,850
He broke his arm hitting the water.

2471
01:04:01,360 --> 01:04:04,210
Jesus fucking Christ son.

2472
01:04:05,020 --> 01:04:05,510
Ah.

2473
01:04:05,510 --> 01:04:07,940
Did you imagine how bad of a feeling of,

2474
01:04:07,970 --> 01:04:08,601
oh my God,

2475
01:04:08,601 --> 01:04:09,434
I fucked up.

2476
01:04:09,620 --> 01:04:14,620
You would be if you were one arm in the
water broken 50 miles from shore and no,

2477
01:04:15,801 --> 01:04:16,990
you're such a Douche bag.

2478
01:04:17,000 --> 01:04:18,210
No one even says anything like

2479
01:04:18,680 --> 01:04:19,070
yeah,

2480
01:04:19,070 --> 01:04:20,090
let him fucking swim.

2481
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:23,240
I saw someone get knocked out
at a bachelor party one time.

2482
01:04:23,270 --> 01:04:24,500
Like he said something to a girl,

2483
01:04:24,530 --> 01:04:27,380
bachelor party since the new girl
and the girl's boyfriend was there,

2484
01:04:27,400 --> 01:04:30,360
it came and knocked the dude out and the
bachelor party just like dropped them

2485
01:04:30,361 --> 01:04:31,280
off Miami and left him.

2486
01:04:31,880 --> 01:04:32,121
They're like,

2487
01:04:32,121 --> 01:04:33,080
well we didn't like him anyway.

2488
01:04:33,470 --> 01:04:34,640
So who got dropped off?

2489
01:04:34,641 --> 01:04:35,620
The guy who got knocked out,

2490
01:04:35,640 --> 01:04:36,473
I got knocked out.

2491
01:04:36,620 --> 01:04:38,570
Oh so he said something fucked up.

2492
01:04:38,620 --> 01:04:39,560
Yeah it was his fault.

2493
01:04:39,561 --> 01:04:43,360
But the guys just left him and so the
other guys continued on the on the tree.

2494
01:04:43,400 --> 01:04:43,810
Yeah.

2495
01:04:43,810 --> 01:04:44,740
That's kind of a win.

2496
01:04:45,610 --> 01:04:46,840
That's definitely a big win.

2497
01:04:47,410 --> 01:04:48,700
He can put that one on your record.

2498
01:04:50,500 --> 01:04:54,190
If you can knock a guy out and you get
to a party on the boat that he used to be

2499
01:04:54,191 --> 01:04:54,521
on,

2500
01:04:54,521 --> 01:04:56,590
but he's not on anymore
cause they pulled him off.

2501
01:04:56,980 --> 01:04:58,390
There had to be more than that story.

2502
01:04:59,080 --> 01:05:00,790
That guy had to be an Uber dude.

2503
01:05:01,290 --> 01:05:02,123
Yeah.

2504
01:05:02,270 --> 01:05:02,610
Yeah.

2505
01:05:02,610 --> 01:05:05,740
Most people must have saw that coming
and they must've been plenty of

2506
01:05:05,741 --> 01:05:06,940
documentation there.

2507
01:05:07,100 --> 01:05:09,860
See the wedding video or the I did the
comedy or the guy attacked me at the

2508
01:05:09,861 --> 01:05:10,694
wedding.

2509
01:05:10,790 --> 01:05:11,091
Yeah.

2510
01:05:11,091 --> 01:05:12,170
What was that about?

2511
01:05:12,530 --> 01:05:13,363
Uh,

2512
01:05:13,400 --> 01:05:15,290
what happened was they hired me to like,

2513
01:05:15,291 --> 01:05:16,130
do I get,

2514
01:05:16,150 --> 01:05:16,461
I get it.

2515
01:05:16,461 --> 01:05:18,610
I'm on this thing called
Gig masters were like,

2516
01:05:18,720 --> 01:05:20,380
I'm sure how comics now
I got to get to go on it.

2517
01:05:20,381 --> 01:05:23,290
But basically like you get
hired to do these gigs,

2518
01:05:23,291 --> 01:05:23,710
right?

2519
01:05:23,710 --> 01:05:25,720
So I got one one week I got hired at dude,

2520
01:05:25,721 --> 01:05:26,680
like these random gigs.

2521
01:05:26,860 --> 01:05:31,690
Like one week I got hired to do a baby
shower or I'm doing comedy during a baby

2522
01:05:31,691 --> 01:05:33,490
shower and like the chick was fucking hot.

2523
01:05:33,520 --> 01:05:34,450
It's hot Brazilian chick,

2524
01:05:34,451 --> 01:05:34,641
but he,

2525
01:05:34,641 --> 01:05:36,030
she hated her husband or something.

2526
01:05:36,040 --> 01:05:36,873
I'm like,

2527
01:05:36,910 --> 01:05:37,211
whatever.

2528
01:05:37,211 --> 01:05:38,044
So,

2529
01:05:38,860 --> 01:05:39,640
uh,

2530
01:05:39,640 --> 01:05:40,241
like I was like,

2531
01:05:40,241 --> 01:05:40,361
do you,

2532
01:05:40,361 --> 01:05:41,410
how the hell did you get her?

2533
01:05:41,411 --> 01:05:41,561
You know,

2534
01:05:41,561 --> 01:05:42,340
you're not gonna be able to,

2535
01:05:42,340 --> 01:05:42,881
she was hoc,

2536
01:05:42,881 --> 01:05:43,301
resilient,

2537
01:05:43,301 --> 01:05:44,410
but I think she hated the family.

2538
01:05:44,530 --> 01:05:46,960
Wanted the how to comic to Piss everyone
off because she was pregnant basically.

2539
01:05:46,961 --> 01:05:47,794
That's what happened.

2540
01:05:48,190 --> 01:05:49,450
But this other thing at the wedding,

2541
01:05:49,690 --> 01:05:53,020
so it feel like roast everybody just roast
every and they don't give me anything

2542
01:05:53,180 --> 01:05:54,730
like to go on to go on,

2543
01:05:54,731 --> 01:05:55,450
just go out there,

2544
01:05:55,450 --> 01:05:56,260
pretend you're the pre,

2545
01:05:56,260 --> 01:05:57,400
it's marrying people,

2546
01:05:57,460 --> 01:05:58,600
the minister and then,

2547
01:05:58,660 --> 01:06:00,250
and then start roasting people.

2548
01:06:00,370 --> 01:06:00,870
So I'm like,

2549
01:06:00,870 --> 01:06:01,301

2550
01:06:01,301 --> 01:06:01,700

2557
01:06:09,130 --> 01:06:10,000

backyard of Apple Valley right now.

2559
01:06:13,571 --> 01:06:15,400
How many people are eating 100 people?

2560
01:06:15,430 --> 01:06:15,641

2561
01:06:15,641 --> 01:06:16,510
just the bride and groom.

2562
01:06:16,630 --> 01:06:17,081
That's it.

2563
01:06:17,081 --> 01:06:17,830
They're the only ones who are in,

2564
01:06:17,830 --> 01:06:18,611
only one is in on it,

2565
01:06:18,611 --> 01:06:19,444

2566
01:06:19,720 --> 01:06:20,260
Nothing.

2567
01:06:20,260 --> 01:06:20,890
Huh?

2568
01:06:20,890 --> 01:06:21,880
That's how I show up with my,

2569
01:06:21,881 --> 01:06:23,800

blah blah blah.

2573
01:06:28,690 --> 01:06:29,381
And then I'm like,

2574
01:06:29,381 --> 01:06:29,950
you know,

2575
01:06:29,950 --> 01:06:30,500
I'm starting to,

2576
01:06:30,500 --> 01:06:31,780

2579
01:06:34,510 --> 01:06:35,220
Oh No,

2581
01:06:35,830 --> 01:06:38,620
And the father look at her tits but nice.

2582
01:06:38,621 --> 01:06:39,454
He was a pretty girl.

2583
01:06:39,560 --> 01:06:40,220
I was like,

2584
01:06:40,220 --> 01:06:42,820
so then the father's looking down like
shaking his head like this can't be

2585
01:06:42,821 --> 01:06:43,450
happening.

2586
01:06:43,450 --> 01:06:44,350
This can't be happening.

2587
01:06:45,990 --> 01:06:46,751
So now I got it.

2588
01:06:46,751 --> 01:06:47,710
You're supposed to be a priest.

2589
01:06:47,770 --> 01:06:49,090
I got to do 45 minutes.

2590
01:06:49,210 --> 01:06:50,090
No Way.

2591
01:06:50,091 --> 01:06:50,620
It's where?

2592
01:06:50,620 --> 01:06:52,720
45 minutes at a wedding.

2593
01:06:52,721 --> 01:06:54,160
So I start going to the crowd.

2594
01:06:54,161 --> 01:06:54,730

2595
01:06:54,730 --> 01:06:55,563

2597
01:06:57,070 --> 01:06:58,660
They told me to be as dirty as possible.

2598
01:06:58,690 --> 01:06:59,410
They don't care.

2599
01:06:59,410 --> 01:07:00,010
You know?

2600
01:07:00,010 --> 01:07:00,720
So I'm like,

2601
01:07:00,720 --> 01:07:01,271
if they don't care,

2602
01:07:01,271 --> 01:07:01,631
I don't care.

2603
01:07:01,631 --> 01:07:02,464
They're the ones paying me.

2604
01:07:02,860 --> 01:07:03,311
So I'm like,

2605
01:07:03,311 --> 01:07:05,550

2606
01:07:05,560 --> 01:07:05,771

crowd was like 20% was laughing,

2610
01:07:18,101 --> 01:07:18,370

2611
01:07:18,370 --> 01:07:18,960
They were,

2612
01:07:18,960 --> 01:07:19,211

2613
01:07:19,211 --> 01:07:19,331

2615
01:07:21,700 --> 01:07:23,380
They didn't take the pin
and then people were pissed.

2616
01:07:23,381 --> 01:07:23,741

2620
01:07:24,700 --> 01:07:28,750
So I started doing the next thing I
know I'm roasting people in the crowd.

2621
01:07:28,751 --> 01:07:28,931
I'm like,

2622
01:07:28,931 --> 01:07:29,020

The Guy Charges me at the
wedding and pushes me.

2651

2658
01:08:10,400 --> 01:08:11,041
Nice job,

2659
01:08:11,041 --> 01:08:11,830
dude.

2660
01:08:11,830 --> 01:08:14,180
When you go to a wedding wearing
white shirts and white sauce,

2661
01:08:14,210 --> 01:08:15,043
that's good.

2662
01:08:16,780 --> 01:08:18,940
I can see your muscle tone
and the stage is not good.

2663
01:08:20,020 --> 01:08:21,560
Your band is not going to make a scenario.

2664
01:08:21,570 --> 01:08:21,681
How?

2665
01:08:21,681 --> 01:08:24,640
Sorry you got to return those highlights.

2666
01:08:33,850 --> 01:08:34,683
This is what I get pissed.

2667
01:08:35,530 --> 01:08:35,831
Sorry.

2668
01:08:35,831 --> 01:08:36,664
The band broke up.

2669
01:08:37,740 --> 01:08:39,230
Alright.

2670
01:08:39,760 --> 01:08:40,593
Wow.

2671
01:08:41,290 --> 01:08:41,621
Thanks.

2672
01:08:41,621 --> 01:08:41,921
Take Care,

2673
01:08:41,921 --> 01:08:42,754
man.

2674
01:08:43,960 --> 01:08:44,793
Whoa.

2675
01:08:45,270 --> 01:08:46,510
Don't stop believing.

2676
01:08:48,100 --> 01:08:48,391
Well,

2677
01:08:48,391 --> 01:08:50,020
if anybody else wants to
do to get to their wedding,

2678
01:08:50,080 --> 01:08:50,913
let me know

2679
01:08:52,570 --> 01:08:53,800
via divorce party next week.

2680
01:08:55,230 --> 01:08:56,590
So that's edited.

2681
01:08:56,680 --> 01:08:58,300
That's like the last part is edited.

2682
01:08:58,450 --> 01:09:01,960
I do 35 minutes before I said any of
us want to do their wedding in between

2683
01:09:01,961 --> 01:09:02,794
that.

2684
01:09:03,010 --> 01:09:03,910
So then it was like,

2685
01:09:04,090 --> 01:09:04,923
then it was going well.

2686
01:09:05,620 --> 01:09:06,360
Well let's go.

2687
01:09:06,360 --> 01:09:08,080
It was actually getting after that.

2688
01:09:08,081 --> 01:09:10,540
People will kind of bonded
together that that was awkward,

2689
01:09:10,541 --> 01:09:12,400
but I kind of went,

2690
01:09:12,401 --> 01:09:13,040
well,

2691
01:09:13,040 --> 01:09:13,540
no.

2692
01:09:13,540 --> 01:09:14,500
Well definitely not.

2693
01:09:14,501 --> 01:09:14,831
Well,

2694
01:09:14,831 --> 01:09:15,280
I'm not going to,

2695
01:09:15,280 --> 01:09:16,150
I'm not going to go there.

2696
01:09:16,770 --> 01:09:18,310
It's got a lot of credit there.

2697
01:09:18,550 --> 01:09:19,630
It went better than that.

2698
01:09:20,590 --> 01:09:24,850
So then I started going and then the
mother's starts yelling at me going,

2699
01:09:24,940 --> 01:09:26,680
no one wants to hear about your sex life.

2700
01:09:26,710 --> 01:09:27,060
I,

2701
01:09:27,060 --> 01:09:27,893
so then I'm like,

2702
01:09:28,090 --> 01:09:28,430
ah,

2703
01:09:28,430 --> 01:09:29,260
it just gets,

2704
01:09:29,260 --> 01:09:30,880
then I got to do 10 minutes after that.

2705
01:09:31,240 --> 01:09:31,661
Finally,

2706
01:09:31,661 --> 01:09:33,340
the guy by your sex life,

2707
01:09:33,820 --> 01:09:34,151
dude,

2708
01:09:34,151 --> 01:09:36,250
it was so awkward.

2709
01:09:36,630 --> 01:09:36,841
I'm like,

2710
01:09:36,841 --> 01:09:38,960
one more to do clean jokes on the cruises.

2711
01:09:38,970 --> 01:09:40,630
You got to do 30 minutes crystal clean.

2712
01:09:40,631 --> 01:09:41,410
So I'm like,

2713
01:09:41,410 --> 01:09:45,040
I had 30 minutes clean jokes cause
there's like kids area on the cruise.

2714
01:09:45,041 --> 01:09:45,321
Anyway.

2715
01:09:45,321 --> 01:09:46,120
So anyway,

2716
01:09:46,120 --> 01:09:47,170
so then after that,

2717
01:09:47,410 --> 01:09:48,340
after that happened,

2718
01:09:48,880 --> 01:09:52,510
I had to wait to get my check and that
guys pacing around inside and I'm like,

2719
01:09:52,780 --> 01:09:53,690
and people were like,

2720
01:09:53,710 --> 01:09:55,060
[inaudible] people gave
me their business cards,

2721
01:09:55,061 --> 01:09:56,080
so do my weddings.

2722
01:09:56,650 --> 01:09:57,190
And uh,

2723
01:09:57,190 --> 01:09:59,740
this clip actually I got
contacted by a company in England.

2724
01:09:59,760 --> 01:10:01,120
It's going to be on a TV show in England,

2725
01:10:01,121 --> 01:10:03,130
like the 10 worst weddings of all time.

2726
01:10:03,670 --> 01:10:04,503
And uh,

2727
01:10:04,510 --> 01:10:05,380
they gave me another thousand.

2728
01:10:05,381 --> 01:10:05,860
So I was like,

2729
01:10:05,860 --> 01:10:06,693
yeah,

2730
01:10:07,590 --> 01:10:07,800
dude,

2731
01:10:07,800 --> 01:10:08,633
it was funny.

2732
01:10:08,890 --> 01:10:09,723
But uh,

2733
01:10:09,820 --> 01:10:10,480
yeah,

2734
01:10:10,480 --> 01:10:12,190
that's a Gig that you kind of take.

2735
01:10:12,270 --> 01:10:12,740
Ah,

2736
01:10:12,740 --> 01:10:14,140
it's one of those money gigs.

2737
01:10:14,800 --> 01:10:15,221
Yeah.

2738
01:10:15,221 --> 01:10:16,330
Like how are we going to do this?

2739
01:10:16,360 --> 01:10:16,970
A fucking,

2740
01:10:16,970 --> 01:10:17,803
I'm just going to do it.

2741
01:10:18,520 --> 01:10:21,550
But I've had so many of those kinds
of experiences where like just doing

2742
01:10:21,551 --> 01:10:22,121
terrible,

2743
01:10:22,121 --> 01:10:22,960
terrible gigs,

2744
01:10:22,961 --> 01:10:23,430
you know,

2745
01:10:23,430 --> 01:10:24,310
what do you get them?

2746
01:10:24,310 --> 01:10:28,120
Like someone called a club and say
we need a comedian and do something.

2747
01:10:28,310 --> 01:10:29,100
Exactly.

2748
01:10:29,100 --> 01:10:29,490
Or like,

2749
01:10:29,490 --> 01:10:29,920
yeah,

2750
01:10:29,920 --> 01:10:34,690
some bizarre comedian to just
being an asshole at our wedding.

2751
01:10:35,130 --> 01:10:35,861
But I used to work at,

2752
01:10:35,861 --> 01:10:37,540
at playboy I was the warmup comic.

2753
01:10:37,541 --> 01:10:38,100
That was the,

2754
01:10:38,100 --> 01:10:40,870
the Helis Gig on the playboy channel.

2755
01:10:40,871 --> 01:10:43,780
They had this thing called night calls
or it was like Jesse Jane and some other

2756
01:10:43,781 --> 01:10:48,520
girl customer price for hosting it at
like 15 naked chicks scissoring each other

2757
01:10:48,521 --> 01:10:49,780
and fisting each other.

2758
01:10:49,781 --> 01:10:50,380
Like Jesus,

2759
01:10:50,380 --> 01:10:51,250
just craziness.

2760
01:10:51,251 --> 01:10:51,640
Right.

2761
01:10:51,640 --> 01:10:53,320
It's like Brian's house
fisting each other.

2762
01:10:53,321 --> 01:10:53,501
I mean,

2763
01:10:53,501 --> 01:10:53,770
they weren't,

2764
01:10:53,770 --> 01:10:54,603
there was history.

2765
01:10:56,220 --> 01:10:57,860
So like what ended up happening,

2766
01:10:57,880 --> 01:10:58,391
but they would have,

2767
01:10:58,391 --> 01:11:00,070
like Steve o was on or had Tony,

2768
01:11:00,071 --> 01:11:00,341
Tony,

2769
01:11:00,341 --> 01:11:03,910
Tony would perform some random talk show
and like it was like the show was like,

2770
01:11:03,911 --> 01:11:04,121
why?

2771
01:11:04,121 --> 01:11:05,200
It's okay to cheat or something,

2772
01:11:05,201 --> 01:11:05,620
you know?

2773
01:11:05,620 --> 01:11:06,850
And I was the warmup comic,

2774
01:11:06,851 --> 01:11:10,690
so I got to do comedy while they're not
filming and it's like the crowd is like

2775
01:11:10,691 --> 01:11:14,010
20 people that don't want to be
seen there and I'm their view of

2776
01:11:14,010 --> 01:11:15,090
20 naked chicks.

2777
01:11:15,470 --> 01:11:17,850
I'd be more like a mixer.

2778
01:11:17,851 --> 01:11:18,450
Where are you from?

2779
01:11:18,450 --> 01:11:18,840
You know?

2780
01:11:18,840 --> 01:11:20,100
And they're playing music over me.

2781
01:11:20,610 --> 01:11:21,860
God like,

2782
01:11:21,900 --> 01:11:22,171
yeah,

2783
01:11:22,171 --> 01:11:23,400
I've had some of the worst.

2784
01:11:23,820 --> 01:11:25,050
It's almost like when you want to have,

2785
01:11:25,080 --> 01:11:25,861
but you know,

2786
01:11:25,861 --> 01:11:27,090
you got to do it as a comic.

2787
01:11:27,091 --> 01:11:29,280
You gotta Brody Stevens is the master.

2788
01:11:29,370 --> 01:11:29,880
Oh yeah.

2789
01:11:29,880 --> 01:11:31,380
Brody's the master of the warmup.

2790
01:11:31,410 --> 01:11:32,790
He's got it down to a science.

2791
01:11:32,791 --> 01:11:34,650
Dawn Buress is awesome at it as well.

2792
01:11:34,730 --> 01:11:35,520
Yeah,

2793
01:11:35,520 --> 01:11:35,760
yeah.

2794
01:11:35,760 --> 01:11:37,260
There's guys that get it down.

2795
01:11:37,470 --> 01:11:38,850
They get it down to a science,

2796
01:11:38,880 --> 01:11:39,450
you know?

2797
01:11:39,450 --> 01:11:40,283
Absolutely.

2798
01:11:40,380 --> 01:11:43,320
Brody would have you call and
asking him to repeat jokes,

2799
01:11:44,330 --> 01:11:47,300
but me and Brody used to did
the laundromats together like,

2800
01:11:47,400 --> 01:11:49,710
and to make you Martin
Chavez in New York City,

2801
01:11:49,711 --> 01:11:52,710
we used to do laundry mats
at that and Andrew Donnelly,

2802
01:11:52,711 --> 01:11:53,341
I remember that.

2803
01:11:53,341 --> 01:11:54,570
Those were like the anchor.

2804
01:11:54,571 --> 01:11:55,680
Donnelley had the funniest joke.

2805
01:11:55,690 --> 01:11:57,510
He's at the laundromat doing comedy.

2806
01:11:57,660 --> 01:11:58,441
He goes to the dryer,

2807
01:11:58,441 --> 01:11:58,830
he goes,

2808
01:11:58,830 --> 01:12:00,030
let me put this on no career.

2809
01:12:03,870 --> 01:12:04,411
There was a,

2810
01:12:04,411 --> 01:12:04,900
um,

2811
01:12:04,900 --> 01:12:05,400
uh,

2812
01:12:05,400 --> 01:12:09,060
episode of opiate Anthony where they
were talking about New York comedians and

2813
01:12:09,061 --> 01:12:09,870
the how,

2814
01:12:09,870 --> 01:12:13,500
how the difference between the New York
comedians and the west coast comedian

2815
01:12:13,501 --> 01:12:14,131
sits in New York.

2816
01:12:14,131 --> 01:12:15,880
Comedians are fucking brutally mean,

2817
01:12:15,881 --> 01:12:16,410
knew each other.

2818
01:12:16,410 --> 01:12:17,040
Oh yeah.

2819
01:12:17,040 --> 01:12:17,940
All the time.

2820
01:12:18,540 --> 01:12:20,280
Constantly fucking with each other.

2821
01:12:20,970 --> 01:12:21,803
But it's like,

2822
01:12:21,990 --> 01:12:24,180
it's expected and appreciated.

2823
01:12:24,181 --> 01:12:25,014
It's like fun.

2824
01:12:25,020 --> 01:12:27,660
The one time I used to play
basketball with like Kevin Hart,

2825
01:12:27,870 --> 01:12:28,890
Patrice O'Neal,

2826
01:12:29,070 --> 01:12:29,940
Rich Vos,

2827
01:12:30,060 --> 01:12:30,893
Jim Norton,

2828
01:12:31,170 --> 01:12:32,003
right.

2829
01:12:32,160 --> 01:12:32,993
Uh,

2830
01:12:33,030 --> 01:12:33,601
and I was like,

2831
01:12:33,601 --> 01:12:36,030
you guys were playing basketball
at three o'clock in the morning.

2832
01:12:36,060 --> 01:12:37,770
They called me and called me open mic.

2833
01:12:37,860 --> 01:12:38,551
You open mic.

2834
01:12:38,551 --> 01:12:39,390
They passed me the ball.

2835
01:12:39,391 --> 01:12:39,901
I was open.

2836
01:12:39,901 --> 01:12:40,590
Like,

2837
01:12:40,590 --> 01:12:42,510
he like Keith Robinson,

2838
01:12:42,511 --> 01:12:43,344
I mean all of these.

2839
01:12:43,500 --> 01:12:44,610
So one time I,

2840
01:12:44,660 --> 01:12:45,301
three in the morning,

2841
01:12:45,301 --> 01:12:47,470
they were playing basketball in your
clock in the morning and we'd always play

2842
01:12:47,471 --> 01:12:47,881
basketball.

2843
01:12:47,881 --> 01:12:49,080
And Kevin Hart was sick.

2844
01:12:49,081 --> 01:12:50,100
He lied everyone up.

2845
01:12:50,130 --> 01:12:52,050
He was the best one by like by far,

2846
01:12:52,470 --> 01:12:54,090
I mean three in the morning,

2847
01:12:54,330 --> 01:12:54,961
three o'clock in the morning.

2848
01:12:54,961 --> 01:12:55,794
We would find some,

2849
01:12:55,890 --> 01:12:57,120
I used to go to the comedy cellar,

2850
01:12:57,121 --> 01:12:58,290
I wasn't like past about it.

2851
01:12:58,291 --> 01:13:00,090
Hang out there and then
go play basketball.

2852
01:13:00,091 --> 01:13:00,811
I'd go with the Condo,

2853
01:13:00,811 --> 01:13:01,381
had basketball.

2854
01:13:01,381 --> 01:13:01,920
Right.

2855
01:13:01,920 --> 01:13:03,660
So what ended up happening was,

2856
01:13:03,661 --> 01:13:04,290
um,

2857
01:13:04,290 --> 01:13:05,060
one time,

2858
01:13:05,060 --> 01:13:05,430
uh,

2859
01:13:05,430 --> 01:13:07,290
Steve Marcel is a funny New York comedian.

2860
01:13:07,291 --> 01:13:08,190
Like he's a really funny guy.

2861
01:13:08,400 --> 01:13:09,233
He goes,

2862
01:13:09,360 --> 01:13:10,440
what if as a gang here,

2863
01:13:10,530 --> 01:13:11,050
what are you going to do?

2864
01:13:11,050 --> 01:13:13,620
We went back without our tape
recorders and then Jim Norton goes,

2865
01:13:13,710 --> 01:13:14,221
press play it.

2866
01:13:14,221 --> 01:13:15,054
They'll run.

2867
01:13:21,280 --> 01:13:21,881
That was like,

2868
01:13:21,881 --> 01:13:22,710
that is a funny,

2869
01:13:22,710 --> 01:13:25,200
I couldn't believe it was
like right on fucking queue.

2870
01:13:25,201 --> 01:13:25,651
I was like,

2871
01:13:25,651 --> 01:13:25,861
dude,

2872
01:13:25,861 --> 01:13:26,370
that's a,

2873
01:13:26,370 --> 01:13:29,040
that's a brain that like that I admire,

2874
01:13:29,041 --> 01:13:29,660
man.

2875
01:13:29,660 --> 01:13:31,290
I should have Norton tool areas.

2876
01:13:31,770 --> 01:13:32,190
He's,

2877
01:13:32,190 --> 01:13:35,490
he's made like single handedly trannies.

2878
01:13:35,491 --> 01:13:35,881
Okay.

2879
01:13:35,881 --> 01:13:36,714
To talk about.

2880
01:13:36,750 --> 01:13:40,430
It's okay to talk about your
training experiences singlehandedly.

2881
01:13:40,710 --> 01:13:41,543
Yeah,

2882
01:13:41,610 --> 01:13:42,443
yeah,

2883
01:13:42,600 --> 01:13:42,781
yeah.

2884
01:13:42,781 --> 01:13:43,680
He's funny as hell,

2885
01:13:43,681 --> 01:13:44,010
man.

2886
01:13:44,010 --> 01:13:44,843
He's an animal.

2887
01:13:45,030 --> 01:13:45,870
I love that guy.

2888
01:13:46,200 --> 01:13:46,951
That whole opiod.

2889
01:13:46,951 --> 01:13:47,580
Anthony Shell.

2890
01:13:47,580 --> 01:13:48,900
So the best show on radio,

2891
01:13:48,990 --> 01:13:51,840
that's the consistently hilarious,

2892
01:13:51,930 --> 01:13:52,830
fucked up.

2893
01:13:52,831 --> 01:13:56,670
Weird and Norton
consistently makes me laugh.

2894
01:13:56,960 --> 01:13:57,780
He's so funny.

2895
01:13:57,780 --> 01:13:59,730
He's just so fucking crazy.

2896
01:13:59,790 --> 01:14:00,623
Yeah,

2897
01:14:02,310 --> 01:14:04,170
he's so off the deep end.

2898
01:14:04,171 --> 01:14:05,004
Crazy.

2899
01:14:05,040 --> 01:14:05,880
He's fun though.

2900
01:14:07,350 --> 01:14:10,500
That east coast sense of
comraderies different too.

2901
01:14:10,920 --> 01:14:12,400
This like more camaraderie.

2902
01:14:12,400 --> 01:14:13,540
I think amongst comics

2903
01:14:13,850 --> 01:14:18,750
it's east coast comedians a lot of
times it's like that's all they want is

2904
01:14:18,751 --> 01:14:19,290
common.

2905
01:14:19,290 --> 01:14:20,970
You know West Coast Comedians,

2906
01:14:20,971 --> 01:14:22,020
sometimes people like they're,

2907
01:14:22,050 --> 01:14:23,460
they do comedy but they also act,

2908
01:14:23,461 --> 01:14:24,050
they produce,

2909
01:14:24,050 --> 01:14:24,830
you know

2910
01:14:24,830 --> 01:14:25,440
something,

2911
01:14:25,440 --> 01:14:25,830
you know.

2912
01:14:25,830 --> 01:14:26,020
Yeah.

2913
01:14:26,020 --> 01:14:29,360
They're trying to get something in
show business so to just trying to be a

2914
01:14:29,361 --> 01:14:29,751
comic,

2915
01:14:29,751 --> 01:14:30,740
they're trying to be famous.

2916
01:14:30,800 --> 01:14:31,633
There's a lot of that,

2917
01:14:31,640 --> 01:14:31,911
you know,

2918
01:14:31,911 --> 01:14:33,400
we've all seen those
guys that go up there.

2919
01:14:33,401 --> 01:14:36,950
I don't even really commerce and kind
of actors and so then they just sort of

2920
01:14:36,951 --> 01:14:38,090
act like a comic,

2921
01:14:38,420 --> 01:14:39,680
which is nothing wrong with that.

2922
01:14:39,681 --> 01:14:40,390
I mean w

2923
01:14:40,390 --> 01:14:42,250
I get more mad at the
audience for laughing at it.

2924
01:14:42,520 --> 01:14:43,870
Like I don't get mad.

2925
01:14:43,871 --> 01:14:44,704
I get disappointed.

2926
01:14:44,710 --> 01:14:45,011
I'm like,

2927
01:14:45,011 --> 01:14:46,270
this is what you guys find funny.

2928
01:14:46,720 --> 01:14:47,021
And then I go,

2929
01:14:47,021 --> 01:14:48,870
maybe I'm not funny cause this
is what they're laughing at you.

2930
01:14:48,890 --> 01:14:52,130
Well if you never been to
comedy before and you know,

2931
01:14:52,131 --> 01:14:55,370
you're not like sophisticated
in the ways of the hack joke.

2932
01:14:55,430 --> 01:14:55,880
Yeah.

2933
01:14:55,880 --> 01:14:56,900
Someone could catch you.

2934
01:14:57,040 --> 01:14:57,610
Yeah.

2935
01:14:57,610 --> 01:14:58,610
You can just go there.

2936
01:14:58,611 --> 01:14:59,600
Especially when you're young.

2937
01:15:00,230 --> 01:15:00,710
Let's dive in.

2938
01:15:00,710 --> 01:15:01,940
The hack joke that bothers me.

2939
01:15:01,941 --> 01:15:02,660
It's like,

2940
01:15:02,660 --> 01:15:04,130
at least there's a joke in the hack joke.

2941
01:15:04,460 --> 01:15:05,690
It's like the act out,

2942
01:15:05,900 --> 01:15:07,220
look how talented I am.

2943
01:15:07,320 --> 01:15:10,280
[inaudible] scream this
method work for somebody else.

2944
01:15:10,340 --> 01:15:11,300
So now I'm going to do it.

2945
01:15:12,120 --> 01:15:12,953
You know,

2946
01:15:13,030 --> 01:15:15,250
guy that I came up with
[inaudible] he was,

2947
01:15:15,430 --> 01:15:18,160
he was ahead of me a
little bit by a few years,

2948
01:15:18,460 --> 01:15:19,360
but he um,

2949
01:15:19,660 --> 01:15:20,600
he had like a,

2950
01:15:21,030 --> 01:15:22,210
or was a weird act.

2951
01:15:22,211 --> 01:15:24,370
It was like a completely contrived act.

2952
01:15:24,790 --> 01:15:26,350
Like everything about him was contrived.

2953
01:15:26,351 --> 01:15:28,330
Like he would wear like
a jacket that had like a,

2954
01:15:28,360 --> 01:15:30,370
like a gas station attendant jacket,

2955
01:15:30,371 --> 01:15:31,600
but he didn't work in a gas station.

2956
01:15:31,880 --> 01:15:32,141
You know,

2957
01:15:32,141 --> 01:15:32,920
he would,

2958
01:15:32,920 --> 01:15:33,490
he would,

2959
01:15:33,490 --> 01:15:37,720
he had a like a look and then he had
like an act and this act that he was

2960
01:15:37,721 --> 01:15:38,890
piecing together.

2961
01:15:39,430 --> 01:15:42,100
I went and saw him before when I was a,

2962
01:15:42,130 --> 01:15:43,960
before I'd ever done stand up.

2963
01:15:43,961 --> 01:15:45,150
I was thinking about doing standup.

2964
01:15:45,160 --> 01:15:49,090
So I went to see some comedy punched
times and I saw him and he made me laugh.

2965
01:15:49,240 --> 01:15:49,991
I thought it was funny,

2966
01:15:49,991 --> 01:15:50,801
like a couple of things.

2967
01:15:50,801 --> 01:15:51,634
I thought it was really funny.

2968
01:15:51,910 --> 01:15:55,570
Then I started doing comedy and then
once I started doing comedy I realized,

2969
01:15:55,600 --> 01:15:55,721
Oh,

2970
01:15:55,721 --> 01:15:56,890
this kind of sucks.

2971
01:15:57,250 --> 01:15:57,521
Yeah.

2972
01:15:57,521 --> 01:15:58,420
I thought it was funny,

2973
01:15:58,450 --> 01:16:01,510
like I thought just like a
year ago that you were funny.

2974
01:16:01,750 --> 01:16:02,110
Yeah.

2975
01:16:02,110 --> 01:16:05,880
And then you realize all the mechanics
behind everything and you know,

2976
01:16:05,890 --> 01:16:06,820
like what he's doing.

2977
01:16:06,821 --> 01:16:08,380
It's just like really clunky,

2978
01:16:08,590 --> 01:16:10,770
overused bullshit.

2979
01:16:10,870 --> 01:16:12,030
No heart behind it.

2980
01:16:12,060 --> 01:16:14,590
No real point of view is kind of
a dick in real life feel like,

2981
01:16:14,650 --> 01:16:15,483
oh

2982
01:16:15,570 --> 01:16:15,751
yeah,

2983
01:16:15,751 --> 01:16:16,190
that happened.

2984
01:16:16,190 --> 01:16:17,430
That that's happening before.

2985
01:16:17,431 --> 01:16:18,151
Like especially,

2986
01:16:18,151 --> 01:16:18,840
uh,

2987
01:16:18,840 --> 01:16:21,660
the first guy I ever opened for
on the road after that prom show,

2988
01:16:21,930 --> 01:16:22,590
this Guy Jack,

2989
01:16:22,590 --> 01:16:22,891
this guy,

2990
01:16:22,891 --> 01:16:23,460
Jim and I,

2991
01:16:23,460 --> 01:16:24,111
he's an asshole.

2992
01:16:24,111 --> 01:16:24,500
He's a fucking,

2993
01:16:24,500 --> 01:16:27,540
his name was Jim and I asked
him and he's a white guy.

2994
01:16:27,570 --> 01:16:28,381
I get a phone call.

2995
01:16:28,381 --> 01:16:28,531
Yeah,

2996
01:16:28,531 --> 01:16:29,480
I got a phone call from this,

2997
01:16:29,510 --> 01:16:30,191
from this book,

2998
01:16:30,191 --> 01:16:30,690
or he goes,

2999
01:16:30,690 --> 01:16:31,141
guess what?

3000
01:16:31,141 --> 01:16:32,910
I got you booked in South Carolina,

3001
01:16:33,060 --> 01:16:33,331
you know,

3002
01:16:33,331 --> 01:16:34,141
it's going to be amazing.

3003
01:16:34,141 --> 01:16:34,560
But I'm like,

3004
01:16:34,560 --> 01:16:34,681
oh,

3005
01:16:34,681 --> 01:16:35,730
this is great myrtle beach.

3006
01:16:36,010 --> 01:16:41,010
So the next thing I know a giant
like van pulls up with this guy,

3007
01:16:41,821 --> 01:16:42,481
Jim and I,

3008
01:16:42,481 --> 01:16:43,314
and there's a black,

3009
01:16:43,530 --> 01:16:45,510
he had this like black puppet named sunny,

3010
01:16:45,511 --> 01:16:46,170
right?

3011
01:16:46,170 --> 01:16:46,870
Like a lifestyle.

3012
01:16:46,870 --> 01:16:47,011
And,

3013
01:16:47,011 --> 01:16:48,390
and he hit a Dick Puppet.

3014
01:16:48,420 --> 01:16:48,931
Like he had,

3015
01:16:48,931 --> 01:16:49,081
you know,

3016
01:16:49,081 --> 01:16:49,710
they'd say,

3017
01:16:49,710 --> 01:16:49,831
oh,

3018
01:16:49,831 --> 01:16:50,820
the guy's got to dig puppet.

3019
01:16:51,050 --> 01:16:52,470
He actually had a dick puppet.

3020
01:16:52,500 --> 01:16:53,333
Right.

3021
01:16:53,430 --> 01:16:54,810
Like swear to God.

3022
01:16:54,960 --> 01:16:58,140
So I like go in this van and we
would drive to Cassie's comedy club.

3023
01:16:59,040 --> 01:16:59,490
And I'm like,

3024
01:16:59,490 --> 01:16:59,920
oh,

3025
01:16:59,920 --> 01:17:00,230
we,

3026
01:17:00,230 --> 01:17:00,721
we're like,

3027
01:17:00,721 --> 01:17:03,060
we should stop off in
Baltimore or something on the
way and they're doing this

3028
01:17:03,061 --> 01:17:04,620
like holiday and with all black people,

3029
01:17:04,740 --> 01:17:06,530
he moves out the black
puppet and I'm like,

3030
01:17:06,540 --> 01:17:07,530
we're going to fucking die.

3031
01:17:07,560 --> 01:17:08,940
Like they're gonna kill him,

3032
01:17:08,990 --> 01:17:09,700
you know?

3033
01:17:09,700 --> 01:17:10,070
Wow.

3034
01:17:10,070 --> 01:17:11,090
But it was actually pretty funny.

3035
01:17:11,660 --> 01:17:12,500
Moral story is,

3036
01:17:12,501 --> 01:17:12,661
yeah,

3037
01:17:12,661 --> 01:17:13,311
he did Dick Bucket.

3038
01:17:13,311 --> 01:17:15,530
But he told me a funny story that
this actually goes somewhere.

3039
01:17:15,890 --> 01:17:17,810
He was saying that he
was driving with Sony,

3040
01:17:17,811 --> 01:17:18,860
the black pop at one time.

3041
01:17:19,310 --> 01:17:19,641
And,

3042
01:17:19,641 --> 01:17:19,791
uh,

3043
01:17:19,791 --> 01:17:21,650
he got a van and got caught on fire,

3044
01:17:21,651 --> 01:17:23,660
got no car accident and he like,

3045
01:17:23,720 --> 01:17:27,560
he was sitting there watching the van
burned down and all these kids are there

3046
01:17:27,590 --> 01:17:28,190
and he's like,

3047
01:17:28,190 --> 01:17:29,030
people that are watching this.

3048
01:17:29,031 --> 01:17:29,181
He goes,

3049
01:17:29,181 --> 01:17:29,750
oh my God,

3050
01:17:29,750 --> 01:17:31,730
my fucking puppet jumps inside.

3051
01:17:32,210 --> 01:17:36,080
Everyone thinks he's rescued this black
kid because he's carrying it and he's

3052
01:17:36,081 --> 01:17:38,210
carrying the head right
and it's so burned down,

3053
01:17:38,211 --> 01:17:41,680
it falls down and he starts
throwing his voice going.

3054
01:17:41,690 --> 01:17:42,141
It's okay.

3055
01:17:42,141 --> 01:17:42,974
I'm all right.

3056
01:17:45,930 --> 01:17:46,111
I know.

3057
01:17:46,111 --> 01:17:46,741
It was a funny story.

3058
01:17:46,741 --> 01:17:47,730
I wanted to share the story.

3059
01:17:48,030 --> 01:17:48,541
Uh,

3060
01:17:48,541 --> 01:17:49,800
it's probably the best
story I've ever heard.

3061
01:17:49,801 --> 01:17:50,634
Fuck man,

3062
01:17:52,740 --> 01:17:53,610
that was so bad.

3063
01:17:54,930 --> 01:17:55,770
I was trying to,

3064
01:17:55,771 --> 01:17:57,690
I was trying to and strong on that.

3065
01:17:57,720 --> 01:17:58,890
This is why I'm good at Twitter.

3066
01:17:59,940 --> 01:18:00,810
Sorry Dude.

3067
01:18:01,170 --> 01:18:02,190
He swung the mess,

3068
01:18:02,191 --> 01:18:02,471
man.

3069
01:18:02,471 --> 01:18:03,570
It happens to the best of us.

3070
01:18:05,070 --> 01:18:06,030
We've all been there.

3071
01:18:06,570 --> 01:18:07,120
Come on.

3072
01:18:07,120 --> 01:18:07,351
Okay.

3073
01:18:07,351 --> 01:18:08,580
I told the story last week to someone,

3074
01:18:08,581 --> 01:18:08,821
they were like,

3075
01:18:08,821 --> 01:18:10,590
you got to tell a story on the fucking,

3076
01:18:10,920 --> 01:18:12,000
did you follow it completely,

3077
01:18:12,001 --> 01:18:12,750
Brian?

3078
01:18:12,750 --> 01:18:13,583
Uh,

3079
01:18:13,800 --> 01:18:14,371
most of it.

3080
01:18:14,371 --> 01:18:14,820
Yeah,

3081
01:18:14,820 --> 01:18:15,653
I wrote it out.

3082
01:18:15,660 --> 01:18:15,991
Okay.

3083
01:18:15,991 --> 01:18:16,890
I have it written.

3084
01:18:19,230 --> 01:18:20,220
I will send you the story.

3085
01:18:20,370 --> 01:18:21,270
If anyone wants to story,

3086
01:18:21,271 --> 01:18:23,940
I'll email them the story
of how it really went down.

3087
01:18:24,000 --> 01:18:25,020
Sounds pretty important.

3088
01:18:25,160 --> 01:18:25,820
Yeah.

3089
01:18:25,820 --> 01:18:26,610
Yeah.

3090
01:18:26,610 --> 01:18:27,443
What else going on?

3091
01:18:29,190 --> 01:18:30,130
Can we transition out of this?

3092
01:18:30,180 --> 01:18:34,360
This is a part of the podcast where people
click onto the Adam Carolla podcast.

3093
01:18:34,400 --> 01:18:35,580
It's also available in light,

3094
01:18:35,581 --> 01:18:36,414
dude.

3095
01:18:37,290 --> 01:18:38,123
Fuck man.

3096
01:18:38,230 --> 01:18:39,120
Be In this year.

3097
01:18:40,110 --> 01:18:40,520
Uh,

3098
01:18:40,520 --> 01:18:42,330
I went and they have a dog.

3099
01:18:42,560 --> 01:18:42,681
No,

3100
01:18:42,681 --> 01:18:44,210
I went to AVN last year.

3101
01:18:44,890 --> 01:18:47,560
For the people at home that aren't freaks

3102
01:18:51,350 --> 01:18:53,110
is the porn awards.

3103
01:18:53,170 --> 01:18:54,003
What's the separate look?

3104
01:18:54,370 --> 01:18:54,881
Look at it.

3105
01:18:54,881 --> 01:18:56,350
How fucked up these two guys are.

3106
01:19:00,110 --> 01:19:02,110
My story and it's so casual.

3107
01:19:02,770 --> 01:19:03,603
So like,

3108
01:19:03,770 --> 01:19:04,603
yeah.

3109
01:19:05,140 --> 01:19:05,920
Yeah.

3110
01:19:05,920 --> 01:19:06,760
You want to go to AVN?

3111
01:19:06,820 --> 01:19:07,660
You're to go down there.

3112
01:19:08,450 --> 01:19:09,160
Probably go down there.

3113
01:19:09,160 --> 01:19:10,510
Thank you for rescuing that story,

3114
01:19:10,720 --> 01:19:12,850
but there's no fucking way what's right.

3115
01:19:12,851 --> 01:19:14,130
You know what we were talking about too.

3116
01:19:14,290 --> 01:19:15,220
But the folks at home,

3117
01:19:15,221 --> 01:19:18,430
like a lot of people like
don't know what the avms are.

3118
01:19:19,110 --> 01:19:21,070
Adult video news or words,

3119
01:19:21,150 --> 01:19:21,430
uh,

3120
01:19:21,430 --> 01:19:23,380
porn awards and it's from C,

3121
01:19:23,410 --> 01:19:26,980
like ces used to be on the same weekend
and he used to be the ultimate place

3122
01:19:26,981 --> 01:19:31,240
cause it'd be like the porn awards on
one floor and then the nerd awards on the

3123
01:19:31,241 --> 01:19:32,520
other floor that stop.

3124
01:19:32,860 --> 01:19:34,120
I think it was just too awesome.

3125
01:19:34,150 --> 01:19:34,660
I don't know.

3126
01:19:34,660 --> 01:19:35,381
It's too awesome.

3127
01:19:35,381 --> 01:19:36,700
The universe couldn't handle it right.

3128
01:19:38,360 --> 01:19:38,970
Last year.

3129
01:19:38,970 --> 01:19:39,560
Uh,

3130
01:19:39,560 --> 01:19:43,630
cause I was doing comedy that
week at the La Comedy Club and uh,

3131
01:19:43,640 --> 01:19:43,980
it was,

3132
01:19:43,980 --> 01:19:44,813
um,

3133
01:19:45,500 --> 01:19:46,333
me and uh,

3134
01:19:46,700 --> 01:19:48,140
I went there last year was if it was fun,

3135
01:19:48,141 --> 01:19:48,741
it was a little crate.

3136
01:19:48,741 --> 01:19:49,431
It wasn't as crazy.

3137
01:19:49,431 --> 01:19:49,631
Haven't,

3138
01:19:49,631 --> 01:19:49,840
you know,

3139
01:19:49,840 --> 01:19:50,510
anytime to everyone

3140
01:19:50,510 --> 01:19:51,440
knows about something.

3141
01:19:51,680 --> 01:19:54,140
It's never as good as if no
one really knows about it.

3142
01:19:54,650 --> 01:19:54,981
You know,

3143
01:19:54,981 --> 01:19:56,140
like everyone's like,

3144
01:19:56,210 --> 01:19:56,780
oh,

3145
01:19:56,780 --> 01:19:57,150
oh,

3146
01:19:57,150 --> 01:19:57,830
AVN awards,

3147
01:19:57,830 --> 01:20:00,250
everyone's all these like
guys like the paid that like,

3148
01:20:00,260 --> 01:20:01,730
are expecting something crazy to happen,

3149
01:20:01,760 --> 01:20:02,600
which never happens.

3150
01:20:02,601 --> 01:20:04,970
It's always like the parties
and no one knows about that.

3151
01:20:04,971 --> 01:20:06,680
That's like the swinger
shit goes on or the,

3152
01:20:07,650 --> 01:20:08,070
yeah,

3153
01:20:08,070 --> 01:20:08,341
yeah,

3154
01:20:08,341 --> 01:20:09,174
yeah.

3155
01:20:10,500 --> 01:20:10,831
But,

3156
01:20:10,831 --> 01:20:11,340
uh,

3157
01:20:11,340 --> 01:20:12,990
the AVN awards chill.

3158
01:20:12,991 --> 01:20:14,310
Everybody's in bed by eight.

3159
01:20:14,940 --> 01:20:15,773
Yeah.

3160
01:20:15,960 --> 01:20:16,780
They all got their,

3161
01:20:16,780 --> 01:20:20,640
their toes with little cotton in between
them and they're reading the book.

3162
01:20:20,940 --> 01:20:22,530
They wild as fuck and electronics.

3163
01:20:22,531 --> 01:20:24,510
People are just on math,

3164
01:20:24,610 --> 01:20:25,720
raging face.

3165
01:20:25,740 --> 01:20:26,573
Fucking

3166
01:20:26,890 --> 01:20:27,390
Nia,

3167
01:20:27,390 --> 01:20:31,810
me and Sam and Doug Benson and end
Jason Rouse or doing a comedy show the

3168
01:20:31,811 --> 01:20:35,290
Thursday night at the vinyl
at the hard rock cafe.

3169
01:20:36,030 --> 01:20:36,180
What?

3170
01:20:36,180 --> 01:20:36,721
Thursday night?

3171
01:20:36,721 --> 01:20:37,554
What night is it?

3172
01:20:37,630 --> 01:20:40,680
What's the date for people listening
to this as an audio podcast?

3173
01:20:40,950 --> 01:20:42,950
January 17th it's an APM.

3174
01:20:42,960 --> 01:20:44,730
It's a part of the AVN package,

3175
01:20:44,790 --> 01:20:45,810
I guess you buy packages.

3176
01:20:45,811 --> 01:20:46,644
Like he just,

3177
01:20:46,870 --> 01:20:47,101
Hey,

3178
01:20:47,101 --> 01:20:49,440
do you want VIP to all
these clubs and parties,

3179
01:20:49,441 --> 01:20:49,711
you know,

3180
01:20:49,711 --> 01:20:50,191
one day,

3181
01:20:50,191 --> 01:20:50,641
two days,

3182
01:20:50,641 --> 01:20:51,474
three days.

3183
01:20:51,570 --> 01:20:54,210
And so we're doing it and it's
actually sponsored by Avn.

3184
01:20:54,211 --> 01:20:55,800
I guess it's going to be a vinyl though,

3185
01:20:56,280 --> 01:20:57,610
so it's helpful.

3186
01:20:57,990 --> 01:20:59,430
We're going to have a bunch of girls.

3187
01:21:00,300 --> 01:21:00,551
Yeah.

3188
01:21:00,551 --> 01:21:01,230
Do that.

3189
01:21:01,230 --> 01:21:02,010
That's pretty cool.

3190
01:21:02,010 --> 01:21:02,750
Fucking,

3191
01:21:02,750 --> 01:21:03,450
that's awesome.

3192
01:21:03,450 --> 01:21:05,160
So was there Brian's
aren't that live in it?

3193
01:21:05,340 --> 01:21:06,450
Nobody invited me to that show.

3194
01:21:07,440 --> 01:21:08,060
Gangster,

3195
01:21:08,060 --> 01:21:08,893
I guess,

3196
01:21:09,070 --> 01:21:09,811
ready to dive in.

3197
01:21:09,811 --> 01:21:11,720
MMA and I guess I'm DMA.

3198
01:21:11,830 --> 01:21:13,360
I guess it was fucking bastard.

3199
01:21:13,361 --> 01:21:14,670
Party's on Saturday night.

3200
01:21:15,420 --> 01:21:16,253
Yeah.

3201
01:21:16,410 --> 01:21:17,890
So it's the same weekend in Vegas.

3202
01:21:18,160 --> 01:21:18,491
He's like,

3203
01:21:18,491 --> 01:21:21,230
I'm going to have my bachelor
party in Vegas during Avn.

3204
01:21:22,500 --> 01:21:22,790
Yeah.

3205
01:21:22,790 --> 01:21:23,990
Having his own show now.

3206
01:21:23,991 --> 01:21:24,824
Is that what's going on?

3207
01:21:24,940 --> 01:21:26,570
It's just MDF talking shit.

3208
01:21:26,930 --> 01:21:28,080
Just talking shit with other,

3209
01:21:28,090 --> 01:21:28,240
yeah,

3210
01:21:28,240 --> 01:21:29,780
but he's keeping the whole talking shit.

3211
01:21:29,910 --> 01:21:30,743
Yeah.

3212
01:21:31,130 --> 01:21:31,401
Why not?

3213
01:21:31,401 --> 01:21:32,300
Just the idea of show.

3214
01:21:32,720 --> 01:21:33,410
Okay.

3215
01:21:33,410 --> 01:21:34,660
It doesn't have to be talking to shit.

3216
01:21:34,870 --> 01:21:36,590
I ended up talking shit
and got him in so much.

3217
01:21:36,740 --> 01:21:36,921
Well,

3218
01:21:36,921 --> 01:21:38,150
so like that's my,

3219
01:21:38,151 --> 01:21:39,840
my website is um,

3220
01:21:39,970 --> 01:21:40,803
uh,

3221
01:21:41,510 --> 01:21:42,021
Joe Rogan.

3222
01:21:42,021 --> 01:21:44,380
Dot Nat and I have a message
board on the message boards.

3223
01:21:44,381 --> 01:21:44,661
Shit,

3224
01:21:44,661 --> 01:21:45,530
talking one on one.

3225
01:21:45,531 --> 01:21:49,040
It's one of the forums and it's
always been shit talking one on one,

3226
01:21:49,070 --> 01:21:49,371
it puts,

3227
01:21:49,371 --> 01:21:51,710
it doesn't really mean you're
supposed to go and talk shit,

3228
01:21:52,370 --> 01:21:52,820
you know,

3229
01:21:52,820 --> 01:21:53,151
it just,

3230
01:21:53,151 --> 01:21:53,870
it's like,

3231
01:21:53,870 --> 01:21:54,420
what are you doing?

3232
01:21:54,420 --> 01:21:55,430
I would just shooting the shit,

3233
01:21:55,460 --> 01:21:55,650
you know,

3234
01:21:55,650 --> 01:21:56,780
like shit talking.

3235
01:21:56,900 --> 01:21:59,600
So it became shit talking one on one.

3236
01:21:59,690 --> 01:22:02,090
Like if anybody says like,

3237
01:22:02,120 --> 01:22:02,953
Hey,

3238
01:22:03,470 --> 01:22:03,920
you know,

3239
01:22:03,920 --> 01:22:08,480
these guys were online and
they said something and it was,

3240
01:22:08,580 --> 01:22:11,240
I really found it offensive and uh,

3241
01:22:11,241 --> 01:22:13,670
I found that disturbing than
anybody would laugh at that.

3242
01:22:14,030 --> 01:22:14,331
Oh yeah.

3243
01:22:14,331 --> 01:22:15,530
What was the forum you were on?

3244
01:22:16,070 --> 01:22:17,930
What was called shit talking one on one.

3245
01:22:18,770 --> 01:22:23,150
I'll come on you silly bitch like w
w how could you be complaining about

3246
01:22:23,151 --> 01:22:24,050
something that you read on?

3247
01:22:24,051 --> 01:22:24,441
Shit.

3248
01:22:24,441 --> 01:22:25,520
Talking one on one.

3249
01:22:25,700 --> 01:22:27,540
Take nothing seriously here.

3250
01:22:28,220 --> 01:22:30,290
Consider consider all that you bang,

3251
01:22:30,320 --> 01:22:31,940
but take nothing seriously here.

3252
01:22:32,540 --> 01:22:33,860
It's called shit talking one on one.

3253
01:22:34,580 --> 01:22:35,570
It sounds good to me,

3254
01:22:35,780 --> 01:22:37,340
but talking shit as a podcast,

3255
01:22:37,400 --> 01:22:38,233
I feel like that's,

3256
01:22:38,510 --> 01:22:39,590
you're really committed to that.

3257
01:22:40,390 --> 01:22:41,240
They're talking shit.

3258
01:22:41,360 --> 01:22:41,750
Yeah,

3259
01:22:41,750 --> 01:22:42,320
exactly.

3260
01:22:42,320 --> 01:22:44,040
You don't have to the whole podcast.

3261
01:22:44,600 --> 01:22:45,433
I totally agree.

3262
01:22:45,740 --> 01:22:46,970
How about just the idea of show,

3263
01:22:47,780 --> 01:22:48,680
what's it make a plea.

3264
01:22:49,040 --> 01:22:49,550
Let's,

3265
01:22:49,550 --> 01:22:52,250
let's try to contact ATF and
steer him towards the light.

3266
01:22:52,820 --> 01:22:53,720
It's not possible for him.

3267
01:22:55,220 --> 01:22:55,701
He's funny,

3268
01:22:55,701 --> 01:22:55,970
man.

3269
01:22:55,970 --> 01:22:57,560
I got to see him in a where was that?

3270
01:22:57,561 --> 01:22:59,360
San Francisco or Oregon or

3271
01:22:59,680 --> 01:23:00,310
San Francisco.

3272
01:23:00,310 --> 01:23:01,143
He was a,

3273
01:23:01,270 --> 01:23:06,010
when we were at that Masonic Hall theater
place and he was over at the punch on

3274
01:23:06,010 --> 01:23:06,090
it.

3275
01:23:06,090 --> 01:23:06,710
Yeah.

3276
01:23:06,710 --> 01:23:07,430
Was really funny.

3277
01:23:07,430 --> 01:23:07,671
Yeah.

3278
01:23:07,671 --> 01:23:09,830
That's fucking awesome,

3279
01:23:09,831 --> 01:23:10,131
man.

3280
01:23:10,131 --> 01:23:11,480
The punchline is awesome.

3281
01:23:11,750 --> 01:23:12,583
Hey FB and B,

3282
01:23:12,640 --> 01:23:13,473
we have to work there.

3283
01:23:13,620 --> 01:23:14,470
ADF inside.

3284
01:23:14,480 --> 01:23:16,880
Now we did at college one time
though that at Penn state.

3285
01:23:17,450 --> 01:23:18,170
And uh,

3286
01:23:18,170 --> 01:23:20,360
it was outside like 300 people.

3287
01:23:20,660 --> 01:23:22,010
It was like the worst gig ever.

3288
01:23:22,011 --> 01:23:25,430
And he's like on the flagpole telling
jokes and there were crickets in the back

3289
01:23:25,510 --> 01:23:26,060
and he goes,

3290
01:23:26,060 --> 01:23:26,211
well,

3291
01:23:26,211 --> 01:23:28,190
there's only so you can actually
hear the actual crickets.

3292
01:23:30,650 --> 01:23:32,000
Actual crickets.

3293
01:23:33,060 --> 01:23:33,890
Yeah.

3294
01:23:33,890 --> 01:23:38,840
I'm trying to think of all the
fucking crazy shows up done outside.

3295
01:23:38,841 --> 01:23:40,160
I did one on a college.

3296
01:23:40,250 --> 01:23:43,670
It was outside in the
muddle platform at night.

3297
01:23:44,930 --> 01:23:45,320
Oh,

3298
01:23:45,320 --> 01:23:46,490
you have a big fish,

3299
01:23:46,940 --> 01:23:47,773
big fish.

3300
01:23:48,300 --> 01:23:51,690
I think it's in Glendale and
it's right next to a train track.

3301
01:23:52,020 --> 01:23:54,810
And the whole time the owner and
the bartender just heckles you.

3302
01:23:56,120 --> 01:23:57,360
And then every five minutes

3303
01:23:59,880 --> 01:24:01,290
like a train goes by,

3304
01:24:01,291 --> 01:24:02,490
it's like the worst.

3305
01:24:02,710 --> 01:24:03,150
Ah,

3306
01:24:03,150 --> 01:24:03,600
one of the,

3307
01:24:03,600 --> 01:24:07,200
one of the worst things I ever did was
opening up for too short the wrapper

3308
01:24:07,650 --> 01:24:11,110
short dog in England in England that,

3309
01:24:11,520 --> 01:24:12,620
can we talk about it now?

3310
01:24:12,630 --> 01:24:13,021
Oakland?

3311
01:24:13,021 --> 01:24:13,854
Yeah.

3312
01:24:14,110 --> 01:24:14,261
No,

3313
01:24:14,261 --> 01:24:14,431
no,

3314
01:24:14,431 --> 01:24:14,760
no.

3315
01:24:14,760 --> 01:24:15,211
Hey Man,

3316
01:24:15,211 --> 01:24:16,090
meet me in Oklahoma.

3317
01:24:16,700 --> 01:24:18,140
Came and meet me in England.

3318
01:24:18,490 --> 01:24:20,340
They have totally different meanings.

3319
01:24:20,430 --> 01:24:21,630
I know it wasn't England,

3320
01:24:21,660 --> 01:24:21,870
but,

3321
01:24:21,870 --> 01:24:22,480
uh,

3322
01:24:22,480 --> 01:24:23,313
fuck

3323
01:24:24,450 --> 01:24:24,880
dude,

3324
01:24:24,880 --> 01:24:25,301
I'm on the,

3325
01:24:25,301 --> 01:24:28,420
I'm not supposed to do a ton of Gemini
in Monterrey and I'm driving and it says,

3326
01:24:28,421 --> 01:24:28,920
uh,

3327
01:24:28,920 --> 01:24:29,360
uh,

3328
01:24:29,360 --> 01:24:29,740
I thought like,

3329
01:24:29,740 --> 01:24:31,570
wait at the Gig and listen to
the radio station like tonight,

3330
01:24:31,750 --> 01:24:33,520
two shorts playing and I'm fucking,

3331
01:24:33,521 --> 01:24:33,701
I'm like,

3332
01:24:33,701 --> 01:24:34,421
I'm supposed to be there.

3333
01:24:34,421 --> 01:24:35,201
That's kind of weird,

3334
01:24:35,201 --> 01:24:35,920
right?

3335
01:24:35,920 --> 01:24:36,271
So I,

3336
01:24:36,271 --> 01:24:37,810
I like go on and they're like,

3337
01:24:37,840 --> 01:24:38,470
oh,

3338
01:24:38,470 --> 01:24:40,060
we have you opening for too short.

3339
01:24:40,270 --> 01:24:41,350
No one's here to see me.

3340
01:24:41,351 --> 01:24:42,970
It's just me swear.

3341
01:24:43,180 --> 01:24:44,110
And it's all like,

3342
01:24:44,140 --> 01:24:44,820
it's me,

3343
01:24:44,820 --> 01:24:45,530
Milton and,

3344
01:24:45,530 --> 01:24:45,930
and,

3345
01:24:45,930 --> 01:24:46,721
and too short.

3346
01:24:46,721 --> 01:24:47,290
Right.

3347
01:24:47,290 --> 01:24:51,580
So I'm just like cursing after every
joke that way they'll like laugh sort of,

3348
01:24:51,581 --> 01:24:51,791
you know,

3349
01:24:51,791 --> 01:24:52,900
like it doesn't ever work.

3350
01:24:53,560 --> 01:24:54,160
It's sort of,

3351
01:24:54,160 --> 01:24:54,341
yeah,

3352
01:24:54,341 --> 01:24:54,600
right.

3353
01:24:54,600 --> 01:24:56,500
Didn't even realize that you're,

3354
01:24:56,501 --> 01:24:56,950
um,

3355
01:24:56,950 --> 01:24:57,970
you're trying too hard.

3356
01:24:58,260 --> 01:25:00,310
You're trying too hard in
front of a black crowd.

3357
01:25:00,311 --> 01:25:01,570
They will not tolerate that shit.

3358
01:25:01,630 --> 01:25:04,330
Absolutely are white crowd would
try to be kind and work with you.

3359
01:25:04,720 --> 01:25:07,210
Black people paid money to
hear you talk and the fee,

3360
01:25:07,290 --> 01:25:07,600
you know,

3361
01:25:07,600 --> 01:25:09,130
funny and get the fuck off the stage.

3362
01:25:09,330 --> 01:25:09,910
That's,

3363
01:25:09,910 --> 01:25:10,990
and once they start billing,

3364
01:25:11,020 --> 01:25:11,890
you cannot return.

3365
01:25:12,310 --> 01:25:13,570
There's no pulling out of that.

3366
01:25:13,650 --> 01:25:14,080
Oh,

3367
01:25:14,080 --> 01:25:14,440
she didn't.

3368
01:25:14,440 --> 01:25:14,780
You don't,

3369
01:25:14,780 --> 01:25:16,390
you don't pull out of that fucking crash.

3370
01:25:17,400 --> 01:25:18,550
Get off the stage,

3371
01:25:18,940 --> 01:25:20,650
but lightly with the fine.

3372
01:25:20,651 --> 01:25:22,360
How do you do and get out of there.

3373
01:25:22,450 --> 01:25:22,661
Yeah.

3374
01:25:22,661 --> 01:25:23,110
This one.

3375
01:25:23,110 --> 01:25:24,070
So then,

3376
01:25:24,370 --> 01:25:24,830
uh,

3377
01:25:24,830 --> 01:25:26,830
too short goes on and he
does like three songs.

3378
01:25:26,831 --> 01:25:26,980
Like,

3379
01:25:26,980 --> 01:25:27,131
man,

3380
01:25:27,131 --> 01:25:27,851
you got to get paid.

3381
01:25:27,851 --> 01:25:28,684
You got to get paid.

3382
01:25:28,750 --> 01:25:28,901
It was,

3383
01:25:28,901 --> 01:25:29,201
you know what?

3384
01:25:29,201 --> 01:25:31,270
I'm not doing any more songs.

3385
01:25:31,271 --> 01:25:33,820
Let you guys give me
$2,000 right to the crowd.

3386
01:25:33,860 --> 01:25:34,693
Yeah.

3387
01:25:34,730 --> 01:25:35,563
Yeah.

3388
01:25:35,590 --> 01:25:38,170
There's like a hundred people there
and some people like passing around a

3389
01:25:38,171 --> 01:25:38,710
bucket.

3390
01:25:38,710 --> 01:25:39,041
Oh,

3391
01:25:39,041 --> 01:25:39,790
come on.

3392
01:25:39,790 --> 01:25:40,610
I swear.

3393
01:25:40,610 --> 01:25:45,580
And then there's no way I'm telling you
like that is the craziest Shit I've ever

3394
01:25:45,581 --> 01:25:45,990
heard.

3395
01:25:45,990 --> 01:25:46,660
Betty goes,

3396
01:25:46,660 --> 01:25:47,493
I ain't,

3397
01:25:47,530 --> 01:25:49,330
I'm not going to do no more songs.

3398
01:25:49,331 --> 01:25:49,991
Less you guys.

3399
01:25:49,991 --> 01:25:50,824
Can we choose

3400
01:25:52,700 --> 01:25:55,930
a raise like 50 bucks or something,

3401
01:25:55,931 --> 01:25:56,110
right?

3402
01:25:56,110 --> 01:25:56,831
Oh my God.

3403
01:25:56,831 --> 01:25:58,000
That is so funny.

3404
01:25:58,090 --> 01:25:58,990
So then right,

3405
01:25:59,050 --> 01:26:00,610
so then he goes,

3406
01:26:00,611 --> 01:26:00,930
all right,

3407
01:26:00,930 --> 01:26:01,020
you

3408
01:26:01,020 --> 01:26:04,190
know what I want to sperm
swallowers blow me on

3409
01:26:04,190 --> 01:26:04,441
stage.

3410
01:26:04,441 --> 01:26:04,980
Right?

3411
01:26:04,980 --> 01:26:05,280
Why?

3412
01:26:05,280 --> 01:26:06,900
I swear I swear to God.

3413
01:26:07,200 --> 01:26:09,190
So then these two fat white chicks go,

3414
01:26:09,210 --> 01:26:09,451
he goes,

3415
01:26:09,451 --> 01:26:10,480
I said sperm swallow,

3416
01:26:10,490 --> 01:26:11,191
it was best for him.

3417
01:26:11,191 --> 01:26:11,700
Whales.

3418
01:26:11,700 --> 01:26:12,030
Right.

3419
01:26:12,030 --> 01:26:15,030
So then then the whole crowd
starts fucking fighting,

3420
01:26:15,031 --> 01:26:15,301
right?

3421
01:26:15,301 --> 01:26:18,450
Like I have a whole crowd but like ha
like a lot of people that are throwing

3422
01:26:18,451 --> 01:26:21,720
bottles and finding him at each
other because the lights go on.

3423
01:26:21,721 --> 01:26:25,080
The cops like conscious over and it was
just one of those things where it like a

3424
01:26:25,081 --> 01:26:28,620
fight cop said the concert over cause we
want to get blown on the two o'clock in

3425
01:26:28,621 --> 01:26:29,071
the morning.

3426
01:26:29,071 --> 01:26:30,600
It was like it started an hour late.

3427
01:26:30,750 --> 01:26:33,810
It was one of those stands
or punch a cock blockers.

3428
01:26:33,930 --> 01:26:34,471
Okay.

3429
01:26:34,471 --> 01:26:35,910
If he actually got blown on stage,

3430
01:26:35,911 --> 01:26:37,770
do anything when it made
the story so much better.

3431
01:26:38,310 --> 01:26:43,310
But all of a sudden your watch that guy
rapping bone over because it was like

3432
01:26:43,591 --> 01:26:44,290
over.

3433
01:26:44,290 --> 01:26:44,560
But,

3434
01:26:44,560 --> 01:26:45,510
but yeah that would be funny.

3435
01:26:45,511 --> 01:26:47,790
If it's like an old man that
would've been sensational.

3436
01:26:47,820 --> 01:26:49,620
So then write a fucking,

3437
01:26:49,680 --> 01:26:51,000
there's like people bleeding.

3438
01:26:51,001 --> 01:26:51,870
It was crazy shit.

3439
01:26:52,720 --> 01:26:54,060
I'm just watching all this right.

3440
01:26:54,061 --> 01:26:56,070
The next day I come back to the
club and the owner was like,

3441
01:26:56,071 --> 01:26:56,904
hey man,

3442
01:26:57,110 --> 01:26:58,200
you would too dirty last night.

3443
01:26:59,230 --> 01:27:00,150
Shut the fuck.

3444
01:27:00,510 --> 01:27:03,330
I swear to God I'm do dirty.

3445
01:27:03,630 --> 01:27:06,990
What about the fucking riot
fucking happen at your club?

3446
01:27:07,650 --> 01:27:08,790
It was fucking crazy.

3447
01:27:08,850 --> 01:27:09,810
That's hilarious.

3448
01:27:09,930 --> 01:27:10,111
Well,

3449
01:27:10,111 --> 01:27:13,740
I think what he was saying is that you
know you were offensive by swearing after

3450
01:27:13,741 --> 01:27:14,574
every choke.

3451
01:27:14,630 --> 01:27:19,630
I know what a silly goose here you can
see that he was obviously he'd be like,

3452
01:27:21,331 --> 01:27:21,720
we have,

3453
01:27:21,720 --> 01:27:23,790
obviously we have other problems as well.

3454
01:27:24,950 --> 01:27:26,950
There was a bit of a
problem with you Adam,

3455
01:27:28,650 --> 01:27:29,700
running a tight ship,

3456
01:27:32,230 --> 01:27:35,430
imaginative to shortlist those
big girls blown on stage.

3457
01:27:36,090 --> 01:27:36,271
Yeah.

3458
01:27:36,271 --> 01:27:36,751
It was crazy.

3459
01:27:36,751 --> 01:27:37,710
You could have been there to watch.

3460
01:27:38,610 --> 01:27:40,230
That would've been a
psychological experiment,

3461
01:27:40,231 --> 01:27:40,740
man.

3462
01:27:40,740 --> 01:27:42,810
That's that to be there live.

3463
01:27:42,811 --> 01:27:43,644
While that happens,

3464
01:27:43,710 --> 01:27:46,980
that's like being in the back of a jeep
while you're watching a lion take out a

3465
01:27:46,981 --> 01:27:47,491
gazelle.

3466
01:27:47,491 --> 01:27:48,780
Looks like you watch it.

3467
01:27:48,781 --> 01:27:52,020
Like real nature in a
strange form right there.

3468
01:27:52,060 --> 01:27:54,720
Can I did too short and
too fat white women just,

3469
01:27:54,900 --> 01:27:55,060
yeah.

3470
01:27:55,060 --> 01:27:57,000
Then he was like so picky.

3471
01:27:57,630 --> 01:27:58,870
If you want to get
someone to blow you off.

3472
01:27:58,960 --> 01:28:00,740
Did you really want it first

3473
01:28:01,270 --> 01:28:01,811
step up.

3474
01:28:01,811 --> 01:28:06,430
You don't want the one who's thinking
hard but not sure and well he just made

3475
01:28:06,431 --> 01:28:07,061
fun of those girls.

3476
01:28:07,061 --> 01:28:08,590
I'm not going up now you don't.

3477
01:28:08,650 --> 01:28:09,550
You don't want that.

3478
01:28:10,040 --> 01:28:12,040
You supposed to take the first soldiers,

3479
01:28:12,430 --> 01:28:13,000
the ones,

3480
01:28:13,000 --> 01:28:16,120
but then again they could have been
like a really hot girl behind them,

3481
01:28:16,121 --> 01:28:17,680
but those fabric just
pushed her out of the way.

3482
01:28:18,940 --> 01:28:22,450
Intimidation and the sheer
bulk to get to two short.

3483
01:28:22,570 --> 01:28:26,200
Somebody got arrested for
getting blown during a concert.

3484
01:28:26,500 --> 01:28:29,350
I think it was Luke from two live crew.

3485
01:28:29,730 --> 01:28:30,560
It was,

3486
01:28:30,560 --> 01:28:31,393
it was it.

3487
01:28:32,710 --> 01:28:33,310
Yeah.

3488
01:28:33,310 --> 01:28:34,270
That's pretty gangster.

3489
01:28:35,950 --> 01:28:36,551
Look that up.

3490
01:28:36,551 --> 01:28:37,510
Find out if that's true.

3491
01:28:37,900 --> 01:28:38,733
Can you look that up?

3492
01:28:39,280 --> 01:28:39,821
Is it Luke?

3493
01:28:39,821 --> 01:28:40,540
Yeah.

3494
01:28:40,540 --> 01:28:41,620
What's the penalty for that?

3495
01:28:42,080 --> 01:28:42,330
Kevin?

3496
01:28:42,330 --> 01:28:43,150
Blow on stage.

3497
01:28:43,150 --> 01:28:46,310
Public display of play of

3498
01:28:46,580 --> 01:28:47,001
awesome.

3499
01:28:47,001 --> 01:28:49,070
This the greatest comic,

3500
01:28:49,490 --> 01:28:52,220
like if I'm having grown on stage while
I'm telling like my therapy jokes would

3501
01:28:52,221 --> 01:28:53,880
have been great if it was
a video of it and yeah,

3502
01:28:53,950 --> 01:28:54,581
couldn't get hard.

3503
01:28:54,581 --> 01:28:54,881
He was like,

3504
01:28:54,881 --> 01:28:56,890
I just don't understand
why it just never happened.

3505
01:28:58,710 --> 01:28:58,820
Well,

3506
01:28:58,820 --> 01:29:00,460
jobs happen all the time
at the comedy store.

3507
01:29:00,461 --> 01:29:01,294
On stage.

3508
01:29:01,890 --> 01:29:02,723
Yeah,

3509
01:29:02,770 --> 01:29:03,820
definitely onstage.

3510
01:29:04,830 --> 01:29:07,080
That is soaker and it's
a lot of it's guys.

3511
01:29:07,530 --> 01:29:08,970
That's how hard is the path there now

3512
01:29:10,970 --> 01:29:13,260
guys are blowing guys
now just for stage time.

3513
01:29:16,160 --> 01:29:17,030
That's the worst.

3514
01:29:17,040 --> 01:29:19,060
That was the only way to get onstage to,

3515
01:29:19,061 --> 01:29:20,100
it'd be dude too would do it.

3516
01:29:20,670 --> 01:29:21,570
There'd be dudes who would say,

3517
01:29:21,571 --> 01:29:21,721
hey,

3518
01:29:21,721 --> 01:29:21,961
you know,

3519
01:29:21,961 --> 01:29:22,501
I don't like it,

3520
01:29:22,501 --> 01:29:23,100
but you know,

3521
01:29:23,100 --> 01:29:23,933
part of the job,

3522
01:29:24,270 --> 01:29:29,030
it just fucking buckled strapped
down at Sarc Cock sucker car cloak.

3523
01:29:29,031 --> 01:29:30,120
Figuratively,

3524
01:29:30,790 --> 01:29:31,110
you know,

3525
01:29:31,110 --> 01:29:31,891
only literally,

3526
01:29:31,891 --> 01:29:33,740
I mean in my real love
making my own decisions.

3527
01:29:33,830 --> 01:29:35,340
That's of the crossover over poetry.

3528
01:29:35,600 --> 01:29:36,840
Like when that's not working,

3529
01:29:37,020 --> 01:29:38,130
just being a funny poet.

3530
01:29:38,160 --> 01:29:39,900
Have you ever seen slam poetry?

3531
01:29:40,320 --> 01:29:41,153
The snapping,

3532
01:29:41,270 --> 01:29:42,270
but when people start snapping,

3533
01:29:42,271 --> 01:29:42,541
I'm like,

3534
01:29:42,541 --> 01:29:43,770
well I can't do all the audience.

3535
01:29:43,771 --> 01:29:45,080
Their staffing when they like it.

3536
01:29:46,290 --> 01:29:47,580
They do that at pool halls too.

3537
01:29:48,090 --> 01:29:48,650
I don't know.

3538
01:29:48,650 --> 01:29:49,320
That's cool.

3539
01:29:49,320 --> 01:29:49,801
That pool halls,

3540
01:29:49,801 --> 01:29:50,820
a guy makes a good shot.

3541
01:29:50,830 --> 01:29:51,663
He'd do a little of that.

3542
01:29:52,560 --> 01:29:54,840
Let them know Dan or you tap
your queue on the ground.

3543
01:29:54,841 --> 01:29:55,350
You're literally killed.

3544
01:29:55,350 --> 01:29:55,601
Tap,

3545
01:29:55,601 --> 01:29:55,831
tap,

3546
01:29:55,831 --> 01:29:56,071
tap,

3547
01:29:56,071 --> 01:29:56,311
tap,

3548
01:29:56,311 --> 01:29:57,120
tap.

3549
01:29:57,120 --> 01:29:57,953
We'll let them know,

3550
01:29:58,070 --> 01:30:00,840
but that's some inside shit
that you wouldn't be aware of.

3551
01:30:00,841 --> 01:30:01,470
Sun.

3552
01:30:01,470 --> 01:30:03,450
I actually met my friend
who's a a porn star.

3553
01:30:03,451 --> 01:30:04,284
T real right.

3554
01:30:04,440 --> 01:30:05,410
I was like this black guy.

3555
01:30:05,411 --> 01:30:05,611
I'm like,

3556
01:30:05,611 --> 01:30:06,444
Hey man,

3557
01:30:06,630 --> 01:30:08,280
you and your buddy ever
double came a chick.

3558
01:30:08,281 --> 01:30:09,960
Isn't that kind of weird
if you have to do that,

3559
01:30:09,961 --> 01:30:11,250
you know like two guys,

3560
01:30:11,251 --> 01:30:11,670
he's like,

3561
01:30:11,670 --> 01:30:12,690
it just like sports.

3562
01:30:12,870 --> 01:30:13,800
You've got to pull your position.

3563
01:30:15,210 --> 01:30:16,043
Wow.

3564
01:30:16,260 --> 01:30:17,093
That's crazy.

3565
01:30:17,440 --> 01:30:17,850
Yeah.

3566
01:30:17,850 --> 01:30:19,180
There was a dude that um,

3567
01:30:20,170 --> 01:30:20,650
uh,

3568
01:30:20,650 --> 01:30:23,790
was telling us about this
was like pre viagara days.

3569
01:30:24,150 --> 01:30:26,610
This dude was telling us
it's about keeping your edge.

3570
01:30:26,810 --> 01:30:27,331
And I was like,

3571
01:30:27,331 --> 01:30:27,720
what do you mean?

3572
01:30:27,720 --> 01:30:28,950
Like keep your hands cause you know,

3573
01:30:29,430 --> 01:30:31,710
keep your heart on man because
you've got to keep your edge.

3574
01:30:32,220 --> 01:30:32,611
And I'm like,

3575
01:30:32,611 --> 01:30:33,840
what do you mean by like your edge?

3576
01:30:33,870 --> 01:30:34,111
He goes,

3577
01:30:34,111 --> 01:30:34,381
just like,

3578
01:30:34,381 --> 01:30:36,210
it's a mindset man mindset.

3579
01:30:37,150 --> 01:30:39,720
You got to keep that mindset
cause sometimes it's doing
shit you don't want to

3580
01:30:39,721 --> 01:30:40,450
do.

3581
01:30:40,450 --> 01:30:41,283
I might go like,

3582
01:30:42,040 --> 01:30:43,560
like Dick's touching decks.

3583
01:30:43,561 --> 01:30:43,920
He's like,

3584
01:30:43,920 --> 01:30:44,670
you know,

3585
01:30:44,670 --> 01:30:45,990
ah Yup.

3586
01:30:46,440 --> 01:30:48,120
When you do a double penetration seen,

3587
01:30:48,350 --> 01:30:48,840
okay,

3588
01:30:48,840 --> 01:30:50,730
you're not doing it in
different dimensions.

3589
01:30:51,090 --> 01:30:51,421
Okay.

3590
01:30:51,421 --> 01:30:56,421
You both inside the vagina and the reality
is when two dudes are having sex with

3591
01:30:56,551 --> 01:30:58,260
a woman at the same time it's,

3592
01:30:58,770 --> 01:30:59,580
you know,

3593
01:30:59,580 --> 01:31:03,210
you just use in her vagina as a
container so that you could rub dicks.

3594
01:31:04,020 --> 01:31:04,853
That's what it is.

3595
01:31:04,890 --> 01:31:06,240
You rubbing your Dick's together.

3596
01:31:06,510 --> 01:31:07,500
That's not sex.

3597
01:31:08,130 --> 01:31:09,570
I mean it is kind of sexual.

3598
01:31:09,600 --> 01:31:10,710
You're like holding it there,

3599
01:31:10,860 --> 01:31:14,130
but you just got to get off on
that dude's warm slippery deck,

3600
01:31:15,130 --> 01:31:17,880
that warm Dick next to your Dick
and you got to somehow or another,

3601
01:31:17,881 --> 01:31:20,010
it's keep your heart on it
now like when I was there,

3602
01:31:20,011 --> 01:31:20,761
but I'm going to Florida,

3603
01:31:20,761 --> 01:31:22,230
this chick that I bang on time,

3604
01:31:22,260 --> 01:31:23,700
it was like my friend let me bang her.

3605
01:31:23,920 --> 01:31:25,710
She's like Bob and you and
you do and this guy at once.

3606
01:31:25,711 --> 01:31:26,330
I'm like,

3607
01:31:26,330 --> 01:31:27,240
oh what a good kid.

3608
01:31:27,241 --> 01:31:27,961
So I was like,

3609
01:31:27,961 --> 01:31:28,830
I was trying to be a good friend.

3610
01:31:28,831 --> 01:31:29,011
I'm like,

3611
01:31:29,011 --> 01:31:29,844
you know what are,

3612
01:31:30,510 --> 01:31:31,530
and then I couldn't get hard.

3613
01:31:31,531 --> 01:31:31,831
I was like,

3614
01:31:31,831 --> 01:31:33,840
I can't like go think guy in the room.

3615
01:31:33,841 --> 01:31:35,970
And I couldn't do it because it was like,

3616
01:31:36,250 --> 01:31:36,381
well,

3617
01:31:36,381 --> 01:31:37,214
he'd probably gang

3618
01:31:39,190 --> 01:31:40,250
gang because you couldn't get out of it.

3619
01:31:40,251 --> 01:31:41,750
You're fighting it so much that you're,

3620
01:31:41,751 --> 01:31:42,001
you know,

3621
01:31:42,001 --> 01:31:42,834
you're in denial.

3622
01:31:43,160 --> 01:31:44,160
They bothers you so much.

3623
01:31:44,340 --> 01:31:45,510
And I came up the next week.

3624
01:31:46,490 --> 01:31:47,490
It was actually,

3625
01:31:47,970 --> 01:31:48,920
it was as good then I,

3626
01:31:48,921 --> 01:31:50,310
then I got fucked everybody after that.

3627
01:31:50,311 --> 01:31:51,270
It just fucking,

3628
01:31:51,370 --> 01:31:51,880
uh,

3629
01:31:51,880 --> 01:31:53,220
a big line of people.

3630
01:31:53,250 --> 01:31:54,240
I just blew the whole,

3631
01:31:54,300 --> 01:31:55,133
the whole Florida.

3632
01:31:55,170 --> 01:31:55,651
Well if you,

3633
01:31:55,651 --> 01:31:58,860
if you're like passing by those
gay clubs on Santa Monica,

3634
01:31:59,960 --> 01:32:00,230
there's

3635
01:32:00,230 --> 01:32:01,850
a lot of times where I'm like,

3636
01:32:02,240 --> 01:32:02,810
you know,

3637
01:32:02,810 --> 01:32:05,090
like these people look like
they have more fun than anybody.

3638
01:32:06,140 --> 01:32:06,610
Like I'm,

3639
01:32:06,610 --> 01:32:06,860
I'm,

3640
01:32:06,860 --> 01:32:08,030
I'm not in the act,

3641
01:32:08,410 --> 01:32:09,800
but they are,

3642
01:32:10,090 --> 01:32:11,570
and they look like they're
having a good time.

3643
01:32:12,170 --> 01:32:13,340
It's a fascinating thing.

3644
01:32:13,940 --> 01:32:18,650
And wonder what it was that made the
transition were gay became homosexual

3645
01:32:18,920 --> 01:32:21,560
because it wasn't during
the Flintstones days.

3646
01:32:21,800 --> 01:32:23,120
During the Flintstones days.

3647
01:32:23,480 --> 01:32:23,990
It was,

3648
01:32:23,990 --> 01:32:25,190
we have a gay old time.

3649
01:32:25,270 --> 01:32:26,300
So back then,

3650
01:32:26,301 --> 01:32:28,730
that's what we know is a cultural
point of reference back then.

3651
01:32:28,760 --> 01:32:29,600
Gay Men,

3652
01:32:29,720 --> 01:32:32,090
we're going to have a grand isle when gay.

3653
01:32:32,091 --> 01:32:32,990
Wonderful 10.

3654
01:32:32,991 --> 01:32:33,980
They were having so much fun.

3655
01:32:34,110 --> 01:32:35,240
It was a gay old time.

3656
01:32:35,270 --> 01:32:35,640
Yeah,

3657
01:32:35,640 --> 01:32:36,590
that makes sense.

3658
01:32:36,710 --> 01:32:38,990
That's what meant
Flintstones meets the front,

3659
01:32:38,991 --> 01:32:41,270
you know that was in the fucking song.

3660
01:32:41,271 --> 01:32:42,770
We'll have a gay right.

3661
01:32:43,640 --> 01:32:44,473
The Flintstones.

3662
01:32:44,990 --> 01:32:48,050
You think the song was
made for Gail time as a no.

3663
01:32:48,110 --> 01:32:50,720
What I mean is when did it switch,

3664
01:32:50,810 --> 01:32:52,340
when did it become homosexual?

3665
01:32:52,400 --> 01:32:53,091
When did,

3666
01:32:53,091 --> 01:32:53,390
uh,

3667
01:32:53,390 --> 01:32:54,200
when did it,

3668
01:32:54,200 --> 01:32:54,770
when did it,

3669
01:32:54,770 --> 01:32:57,800
when did gay become a
slang for homosexual?

3670
01:32:57,801 --> 01:33:02,801
To the point where it's like
accepted as a like nomenclature gay.

3671
01:33:02,901 --> 01:33:03,621
It's like you know,

3672
01:33:03,621 --> 01:33:04,371
lesbian,

3673
01:33:04,371 --> 01:33:05,060
gay,

3674
01:33:05,060 --> 01:33:05,660
Bi,

3675
01:33:05,660 --> 01:33:06,493
transgender.

3676
01:33:06,520 --> 01:33:09,140
Like Ge is in there for gay,

3677
01:33:09,860 --> 01:33:10,340
you know,

3678
01:33:10,340 --> 01:33:12,320
instead of homosexual it's gay.

3679
01:33:12,410 --> 01:33:13,820
Whereas at one point in time,

3680
01:33:13,940 --> 01:33:18,940
but it's amazing because gay became
like the actual like common term for it

3681
01:33:19,400 --> 01:33:19,990
everyday of day.

3682
01:33:19,990 --> 01:33:23,840
Are we having so much fun that they had
the suck a cock and then it became gay.

3683
01:33:24,410 --> 01:33:28,790
It's one of the few names for someone
that somehow or another they just enjoyed

3684
01:33:28,791 --> 01:33:32,450
an incorporated to the point where
it's a commonly accepted term for it.

3685
01:33:32,600 --> 01:33:34,270
For Gay only.

3686
01:33:34,840 --> 01:33:35,690
For homosexual.

3687
01:33:35,720 --> 01:33:36,580
Gay is the,

3688
01:33:36,620 --> 01:33:39,680
there's nothing offensive about
calling a homosexual person gay.

3689
01:33:40,100 --> 01:33:42,170
But if you look back at gay,

3690
01:33:42,171 --> 01:33:43,520
gay used to mean something else.

3691
01:33:43,570 --> 01:33:43,750
Yeah.

3692
01:33:43,750 --> 01:33:45,590
And then somehow or another it became gay,

3693
01:33:45,591 --> 01:33:48,050
but to the point or it
became a homosexual.

3694
01:33:48,170 --> 01:33:51,980
But it be to the point of
it being the way to say it,

3695
01:33:52,460 --> 01:33:53,900
it's not offensive at all.

3696
01:33:53,901 --> 01:33:54,770
Gay people use it.

3697
01:33:54,771 --> 01:33:54,921
Oh,

3698
01:33:54,921 --> 01:33:55,521
I'm gay.

3699
01:33:55,521 --> 01:33:55,791
You know,

3700
01:33:55,791 --> 01:33:55,931
they,

3701
01:33:55,931 --> 01:33:57,260
they'll use it that way.

3702
01:33:57,261 --> 01:33:58,680
And it's not an offense of terminology.

3703
01:33:58,790 --> 01:33:59,181
It's not,

3704
01:33:59,181 --> 01:34:00,500
I'm homosexual.

3705
01:34:00,640 --> 01:34:01,820
I say I'm gay,

3706
01:34:02,450 --> 01:34:04,220
but it never ever got bad.

3707
01:34:04,310 --> 01:34:04,641
You know?

3708
01:34:04,641 --> 01:34:05,120
It's not like,

3709
01:34:05,120 --> 01:34:05,241
oh,

3710
01:34:05,241 --> 01:34:05,880
I'm a faggot.

3711
01:34:05,880 --> 01:34:06,201
You're like,

3712
01:34:06,201 --> 01:34:06,860
Whoa,

3713
01:34:06,860 --> 01:34:07,610
oh dude,

3714
01:34:07,610 --> 01:34:09,140
don't say that about yourself.

3715
01:34:09,141 --> 01:34:10,130
Don't use that term.

3716
01:34:10,180 --> 01:34:10,340
Right.

3717
01:34:10,340 --> 01:34:11,480
Don't use that thinking.

3718
01:34:11,860 --> 01:34:12,140
You know,

3719
01:34:12,140 --> 01:34:15,710
but gay is not that gay is just homosexual
to the point where it's actually on.

3720
01:34:15,711 --> 01:34:15,950
Like,

3721
01:34:15,950 --> 01:34:16,431
you know,

3722
01:34:16,431 --> 01:34:17,370
you could sign things,

3723
01:34:17,371 --> 01:34:17,931
so are you gay?

3724
01:34:17,931 --> 01:34:18,980
You have to like,

3725
01:34:19,490 --> 01:34:20,121
it's weird.

3726
01:34:20,121 --> 01:34:22,070
It's weird how that one got accepted.

3727
01:34:22,190 --> 01:34:22,980
Like it's okay.

3728
01:34:22,980 --> 01:34:24,150
I'm just happy that it's now like,

3729
01:34:24,180 --> 01:34:24,991
like during the kitchen,

3730
01:34:24,991 --> 01:34:26,430
I'll say to a gay pride parade,

3731
01:34:26,580 --> 01:34:27,720
it doesn't offend people.

3732
01:34:27,721 --> 01:34:28,321
That's the worst.

3733
01:34:28,321 --> 01:34:29,154
When you can't,

3734
01:34:29,340 --> 01:34:30,270
you say gay something.

3735
01:34:30,920 --> 01:34:31,240
Yeah.

3736
01:34:31,240 --> 01:34:34,250
That's like as a comic it's just
brutal and you have to like,

3737
01:34:34,510 --> 01:34:36,960
gays are silly and should
be able to make fun of him.

3738
01:34:37,140 --> 01:34:38,190
There's a lot of fun in there.

3739
01:34:38,220 --> 01:34:39,770
Or just or just say gay pride parade.

3740
01:34:39,771 --> 01:34:40,650
It's not making fun of it.

3741
01:34:40,651 --> 01:34:42,780
Like the joke was like I
was at the Gay Pride Parade,

3742
01:34:43,110 --> 01:34:43,900
uh,

3743
01:34:43,900 --> 01:34:46,440
at in New York who was the Puerto Rican
Day parade in the Gay Pride Parade.

3744
01:34:46,650 --> 01:34:51,270
Ricky Martin left 127 miles because
he's both gay and Puerto Rican.

3745
01:34:51,271 --> 01:34:51,800
Right.

3746
01:34:51,800 --> 01:34:52,290
And I'm happy.

3747
01:34:52,290 --> 01:34:52,980
That's very funny.

3748
01:34:52,980 --> 01:34:54,840
But I'm happy that I could
say that at a kid show.

3749
01:34:54,841 --> 01:34:55,680
It's not offensive.

3750
01:34:55,940 --> 01:34:57,000
It's the worst when you have to,

3751
01:34:57,620 --> 01:34:57,711
Oh,

3752
01:34:57,711 --> 01:34:58,890
you can't say gay around kids.

3753
01:34:58,891 --> 01:34:59,724
It's like why not?

3754
01:34:59,800 --> 01:35:03,520
I think it's pretty clear
that the standards for
what's offensive are changing

3755
01:35:03,521 --> 01:35:04,420
because of the Internet.

3756
01:35:04,490 --> 01:35:05,291
It's pretty,

3757
01:35:05,291 --> 01:35:06,250
pretty obvious.

3758
01:35:06,340 --> 01:35:06,910
You know,

3759
01:35:06,910 --> 01:35:08,410
I point a fear factor.

3760
01:35:08,890 --> 01:35:09,430
I'll look.

3761
01:35:09,430 --> 01:35:11,560
When I first started doing it too,

3762
01:35:11,580 --> 01:35:13,000
when when I first started doing,

3763
01:35:13,001 --> 01:35:17,980
it was like 2002 to what they tried to
get us to do in 2011 is a very completely

3764
01:35:17,981 --> 01:35:19,480
different level of acceptance.

3765
01:35:19,840 --> 01:35:21,460
Like they were trying to get him to drink,

3766
01:35:21,461 --> 01:35:22,294
come,

3767
01:35:22,480 --> 01:35:22,820
you know,

3768
01:35:22,820 --> 01:35:23,150
they,

3769
01:35:23,150 --> 01:35:23,570
they,

3770
01:35:23,570 --> 01:35:24,403
they did it.

3771
01:35:25,030 --> 01:35:29,770
They drank jugs of com did that would
have never flown before the Internet.

3772
01:35:29,800 --> 01:35:31,630
There is no fucking way.

3773
01:35:32,020 --> 01:35:32,400
No,

3774
01:35:32,400 --> 01:35:35,960
I love the sons of anarchy and breaking
bad and decks another Dexter the kite

3775
01:35:35,990 --> 01:35:36,301
cable.

3776
01:35:36,301 --> 01:35:40,110
But I love the fact that I chose that I
could actually watch and not feel like

3777
01:35:40,380 --> 01:35:41,430
they're always like,

3778
01:35:41,431 --> 01:35:42,900
I feel like in comedy in life,

3779
01:35:43,170 --> 01:35:44,700
it's always that the one person,

3780
01:35:44,730 --> 01:35:46,050
it's never the 99 people.

3781
01:35:46,051 --> 01:35:46,530
It's like,

3782
01:35:46,530 --> 01:35:46,711
oh,

3783
01:35:46,711 --> 01:35:47,670
one guy wrote a letter.

3784
01:35:47,700 --> 01:35:49,410
Well what about the 300
people to show who didn't?

3785
01:35:49,460 --> 01:35:49,580
Oh,

3786
01:35:49,580 --> 01:35:50,760
all the one person were to letter.

3787
01:35:51,000 --> 01:35:52,860
It's like you always have
to paint it to that person.

3788
01:35:53,160 --> 01:35:54,090
And I think it's like,

3789
01:35:54,180 --> 01:35:54,900
oh,

3790
01:35:54,900 --> 01:35:55,860
so many people like,

3791
01:35:56,310 --> 01:35:56,461
oh.

3792
01:35:56,461 --> 01:35:56,880
It's like,

3793
01:35:56,880 --> 01:35:57,181
well,

3794
01:35:57,181 --> 01:35:58,200
it was anybody offended?

3795
01:35:58,230 --> 01:35:58,650
No.

3796
01:35:58,650 --> 01:35:58,921
Okay,

3797
01:35:58,921 --> 01:35:59,580
we're fine.

3798
01:35:59,580 --> 01:36:00,620
Not that everyone laugh.

3799
01:36:00,650 --> 01:36:01,010
It's

3800
01:36:01,010 --> 01:36:02,040
nobody was offended.

3801
01:36:02,070 --> 01:36:04,860
You know what they want to try to do is
they want to be edgy and they want to

3802
01:36:04,861 --> 01:36:09,000
take chances but they don't want to
fall and so then you're not at gene,

3803
01:36:09,001 --> 01:36:09,930
you're not taking chances.

3804
01:36:09,931 --> 01:36:13,260
So you'll never get ahead g and you
never going to get chances on something

3805
01:36:13,261 --> 01:36:14,070
like,

3806
01:36:14,070 --> 01:36:14,521
you know,

3807
01:36:14,521 --> 01:36:19,521
mainstream talk shows like the tonight
show is pretty squeaky except for,

3808
01:36:19,900 --> 01:36:20,460
you know what?

3809
01:36:20,460 --> 01:36:21,293
Uh,

3810
01:36:21,420 --> 01:36:24,060
Norton actually said that
his sets on the tonight show,

3811
01:36:24,061 --> 01:36:24,361
he,

3812
01:36:24,361 --> 01:36:25,860
they give him more leeway.

3813
01:36:26,740 --> 01:36:27,471
I did that joke on him.

3814
01:36:27,471 --> 01:36:29,440
I don't want to get a
bunch of jokes that like,

3815
01:36:29,441 --> 01:36:30,040
they're like fine,

3816
01:36:30,040 --> 01:36:32,110
they're getting more Norton risque,

3817
01:36:32,140 --> 01:36:32,471
risque,

3818
01:36:32,471 --> 01:36:34,660
which is great because
it's like they have to,

3819
01:36:34,800 --> 01:36:37,150
because otherwise I'm not entertained.

3820
01:36:37,180 --> 01:36:37,660
I'm not,

3821
01:36:37,660 --> 01:36:39,600
I'm not going to laugh
at a sitcom that like,

3822
01:36:40,000 --> 01:36:41,010
I know the jokes are true

3823
01:36:41,260 --> 01:36:45,100
written for a 12 year old
or a conservative housewife.

3824
01:36:45,130 --> 01:36:46,330
It's not going to make me laugh.

3825
01:36:46,350 --> 01:36:46,690
They,

3826
01:36:46,690 --> 01:36:48,940
and that is a form of programming to,

3827
01:36:48,970 --> 01:36:50,320
it doesn't seem like it is,

3828
01:36:50,321 --> 01:36:54,580
but for really stupid people it is
when you give them mundane thoughts on

3829
01:36:54,581 --> 01:36:58,870
mundane art and Monday and comedy in
this water down bullshit over and over

3830
01:36:58,871 --> 01:36:59,770
again and they accept it.

3831
01:36:59,771 --> 01:37:00,730
It's dulling,

3832
01:37:01,120 --> 01:37:03,530
it's dulling because it's like you're,

3833
01:37:03,650 --> 01:37:07,090
you're just watching it cause he keeps
moving and it keeps being on there keeps

3834
01:37:07,091 --> 01:37:08,160
being things that are,

3835
01:37:08,850 --> 01:37:12,300
that you could follow but
you're not getting any
satisfaction of following these

3836
01:37:12,301 --> 01:37:12,960
things.

3837
01:37:12,960 --> 01:37:17,550
So when you're watching like really
dull stupid thoughts that are being

3838
01:37:17,551 --> 01:37:18,860
exhibited in,

3839
01:37:18,861 --> 01:37:19,890
in the shows,

3840
01:37:20,220 --> 01:37:22,470
it's like dulling your,

3841
01:37:22,500 --> 01:37:27,500
your like your reality is so fucking
boring and you're so miss directed that

3842
01:37:29,461 --> 01:37:34,461
you're actually sitting there watching
an artificial reality that's infinitely

3843
01:37:34,681 --> 01:37:37,530
more boring than the
actual reality you live in.

3844
01:37:37,590 --> 01:37:42,480
I bet you're locked in watching this
stupid fake dad with his stupid fake

3845
01:37:42,481 --> 01:37:44,490
argument with a stupid fake wife,

3846
01:37:44,760 --> 01:37:47,580
and you're watching these two knuckleheads
going back and forth with this

3847
01:37:47,940 --> 01:37:50,990
artificial resolution doesn't
make any sense and the real world.

3848
01:37:51,150 --> 01:37:51,541
Well,

3849
01:37:51,541 --> 01:37:51,991
you know,

3850
01:37:51,991 --> 01:37:53,880
we've got to keep this
family together and like,

3851
01:37:53,881 --> 01:37:54,090
yeah,

3852
01:37:54,090 --> 01:37:57,960
that's how fuck you're breaking
people's brains with that horse shit.

3853
01:37:58,170 --> 01:37:58,700
When you,

3854
01:37:58,700 --> 01:38:00,540
you make people watch stuff like that.

3855
01:38:00,541 --> 01:38:00,750
Yeah.

3856
01:38:00,750 --> 01:38:05,750
You're pumping shit thoughts into their
pea brains and it's sloshes around in

3857
01:38:06,361 --> 01:38:07,430
there and everything.

3858
01:38:07,500 --> 01:38:07,641
Oh,

3859
01:38:07,641 --> 01:38:11,050
that's why I get upset when you say
the hacky conduct makes a joke and they

3860
01:38:11,051 --> 01:38:12,280
laugh because I think that that,

3861
01:38:12,281 --> 01:38:16,740
back to that of like they're laughing at
what they've been trained to laugh at,

3862
01:38:16,750 --> 01:38:17,583
which is bullshit.

3863
01:38:17,680 --> 01:38:19,390
Sometimes the laugh and just had a rhythm.

3864
01:38:19,450 --> 01:38:19,721
You know,

3865
01:38:19,721 --> 01:38:20,020
there's a,

3866
01:38:20,020 --> 01:38:21,130
there was a lot of comics,

3867
01:38:21,131 --> 01:38:23,350
especially in the 80s
that weren't funny at all.

3868
01:38:23,470 --> 01:38:24,070
They just had,

3869
01:38:24,070 --> 01:38:26,980
they would say funny in a
funny way with a rhythm.

3870
01:38:27,280 --> 01:38:28,113
Yeah.

3871
01:38:28,260 --> 01:38:28,720
Yeah.

3872
01:38:28,720 --> 01:38:29,740
And then somehow or another,

3873
01:38:29,741 --> 01:38:31,190
they thought that that was a word.

3874
01:38:31,260 --> 01:38:31,860
Some of these guys.

3875
01:38:31,860 --> 01:38:32,360
Yeah.

3876
01:38:32,360 --> 01:38:33,193
Now who like,

3877
01:38:33,250 --> 01:38:33,400
Oh,

3878
01:38:33,400 --> 01:38:34,880
I did Carson at that letter.

3879
01:38:34,920 --> 01:38:35,530
Yeah.

3880
01:38:35,530 --> 01:38:37,120
And just like a man,

3881
01:38:37,620 --> 01:38:38,580
the creativity,

3882
01:38:38,581 --> 01:38:38,971
you know,

3883
01:38:38,971 --> 01:38:43,440
that's the one for a lot of folks
is the most difficult aspect of it.

3884
01:38:43,470 --> 01:38:44,281
The creativity,

3885
01:38:44,281 --> 01:38:45,690
the ability to create pits,

3886
01:38:45,750 --> 01:38:47,910
the ability to come up with
stuff that's relevant and funny.

3887
01:38:47,980 --> 01:38:48,680
Brian Cowen,

3888
01:38:48,680 --> 01:38:50,180
I called him up one day and counselor,

3889
01:38:50,181 --> 01:38:53,080
you've been like kind of a
mentor to me and he's like,

3890
01:38:53,140 --> 01:38:53,621
oh,

3891
01:38:53,621 --> 01:38:57,850
someone's going to fucking hit
the rock like the cabins one day.

3892
01:38:57,851 --> 01:38:58,381
I'm like hell.

3893
01:38:58,381 --> 01:38:59,830
And I didn't get Montreal.

3894
01:38:59,831 --> 01:39:00,850
My manager left me,

3895
01:39:01,030 --> 01:39:02,480
I got thrown off last time,

3896
01:39:02,560 --> 01:39:03,760
whatever I was telling him and he's like,

3897
01:39:03,761 --> 01:39:04,594
Bro,

3898
01:39:04,600 --> 01:39:06,100
put your head down and write.

3899
01:39:06,600 --> 01:39:07,960
That's just keep working.

3900
01:39:08,230 --> 01:39:08,710
Don't,

3901
01:39:08,710 --> 01:39:13,710
and that's to me what I have to remind
myself to do is just have tunnel vision

3902
01:39:14,260 --> 01:39:17,760
of like don't worry about what everyone
else is doing and everyone else who's

3903
01:39:17,770 --> 01:39:18,371
succeeding.

3904
01:39:18,371 --> 01:39:21,910
And that's the hardest part for
me is to like actually do that.

3905
01:39:22,050 --> 01:39:22,351
Yeah.

3906
01:39:22,351 --> 01:39:24,450
That's why what we were
talking about earlier about,

3907
01:39:24,480 --> 01:39:24,841
you know,

3908
01:39:24,841 --> 01:39:25,261
you were like,

3909
01:39:25,261 --> 01:39:28,290
when do you have the time to look
at all these different things?

3910
01:39:28,291 --> 01:39:29,370
And read all these different things.

3911
01:39:29,550 --> 01:39:32,100
Well those are the things that are
interesting to me because I don't have to

3912
01:39:32,101 --> 01:39:33,450
worry about that other stuff anymore.

3913
01:39:33,480 --> 01:39:34,980
And when you don't have
to worry about like,

3914
01:39:35,310 --> 01:39:35,551
you know,

3915
01:39:35,551 --> 01:39:38,520
if they're constantly scramble and warrior
like what's going to happen with my

3916
01:39:38,521 --> 01:39:38,911
career?

3917
01:39:38,911 --> 01:39:40,860
Where am I going to be in a year from now?

3918
01:39:40,861 --> 01:39:42,240
Am I going to be able to pay my bills?

3919
01:39:42,560 --> 01:39:44,190
When that shit's out of the way,

3920
01:39:44,220 --> 01:39:46,500
you can just concentrate on
things that you find interesting.

3921
01:39:46,530 --> 01:39:48,150
And oddly enough,

3922
01:39:48,180 --> 01:39:51,300
I'm more productive that
way than I ever was.

3923
01:39:51,330 --> 01:39:51,571
You know,

3924
01:39:51,571 --> 01:39:54,690
in a way where I was just
trying to be productive,

3925
01:39:54,920 --> 01:39:55,261
you know,

3926
01:39:55,261 --> 01:39:58,500
and concentrating on that instead of
concentrating on the actual stuff I'm

3927
01:39:58,501 --> 01:39:59,260
doing.

3928
01:39:59,260 --> 01:39:59,700
But now,

3929
01:39:59,700 --> 01:39:59,911
now,

3930
01:39:59,911 --> 01:40:01,740
because I can concentrate on
the actual stuff I'm doing,

3931
01:40:01,741 --> 01:40:05,490
whether it's podcasts or writing
comedy or working for the UFC,

3932
01:40:05,491 --> 01:40:07,680
I can concentrate only on that stuff.

3933
01:40:07,740 --> 01:40:07,981
Yeah,

3934
01:40:07,981 --> 01:40:08,430
that's what I'm,

3935
01:40:08,430 --> 01:40:08,880
that's the,

3936
01:40:08,880 --> 01:40:10,920
that's the one thing about
like the shifts or whatever,

3937
01:40:10,921 --> 01:40:13,950
like the downtime to create is like,

3938
01:40:14,270 --> 01:40:15,570
like I've finally like,

3939
01:40:16,050 --> 01:40:16,883
you know,

3940
01:40:17,220 --> 01:40:18,300
finished two scripts.

3941
01:40:18,520 --> 01:40:19,351
You're going to sell those.

3942
01:40:19,351 --> 01:40:20,480
Sold a TV show to,

3943
01:40:20,481 --> 01:40:20,620
uh,

3944
01:40:20,620 --> 01:40:21,930
to fuel a couple of months ago.

3945
01:40:22,500 --> 01:40:22,921
It's awesome.

3946
01:40:22,921 --> 01:40:23,730
Congratulations.

3947
01:40:23,730 --> 01:40:24,201
Oh Bang.

3948
01:40:24,201 --> 01:40:28,020
If you will actually just got some cable
award for being the fastest growing

3949
01:40:28,380 --> 01:40:30,840
channel on cable in 2012.

3950
01:40:31,230 --> 01:40:32,370
They gained more,

3951
01:40:32,400 --> 01:40:34,120
more viewers on 2012.

3952
01:40:34,150 --> 01:40:34,711
They didn't take it out,

3953
01:40:34,711 --> 01:40:35,700
but that's how I sold it to them.

3954
01:40:35,760 --> 01:40:36,301
It's a lot of it.

3955
01:40:36,301 --> 01:40:38,040
I think the UFC,

3956
01:40:38,370 --> 01:40:40,710
cause it's so much fights
on great over there.

3957
01:40:40,770 --> 01:40:41,551
It's fucking incredible.

3958
01:40:41,551 --> 01:40:46,500
You Watch fuel most most days there's
fights on and it's like basically like the

3959
01:40:46,501 --> 01:40:47,390
fucking UFC now.

3960
01:40:47,500 --> 01:40:49,450
It is beautiful.

3961
01:40:49,451 --> 01:40:50,284
And uh,

3962
01:40:50,590 --> 01:40:52,450
and now I'm like producing another show,

3963
01:40:52,960 --> 01:40:53,261
you know,

3964
01:40:53,261 --> 01:40:54,070
and then working

3965
01:40:54,070 --> 01:40:54,460
on,

3966
01:40:54,460 --> 01:40:55,293
you know,

3967
01:40:55,660 --> 01:40:56,380
like I did Leno,

3968
01:40:56,380 --> 01:40:56,921
that was cool.

3969
01:40:56,921 --> 01:40:59,560
So this is constantly working and I'll
kind of get the enemy roasted bigger

3970
01:40:59,561 --> 01:41:00,490
cause I think it's like,

3971
01:41:01,090 --> 01:41:05,950
well this is a huge market for MMA fans
now and to have like a strict humor

3972
01:41:05,951 --> 01:41:06,700
site.

3973
01:41:06,700 --> 01:41:08,810
There's a few guys that do
like Tommy Toehold Avila.

3974
01:41:08,890 --> 01:41:09,161
Yeah,

3975
01:41:09,161 --> 01:41:09,820
he's fine.

3976
01:41:09,820 --> 01:41:11,200
Hilarious man.

3977
01:41:11,201 --> 01:41:11,331
Those,

3978
01:41:11,331 --> 01:41:13,120
those things are fucking hilarious.

3979
01:41:13,480 --> 01:41:13,871
And,

3980
01:41:13,871 --> 01:41:13,991
uh,

3981
01:41:13,991 --> 01:41:14,201
you know,

3982
01:41:14,201 --> 01:41:17,980
there's a few other sites that have done
like animations and stuff like that.

3983
01:41:18,280 --> 01:41:21,310
They're really funny people
are the memes people.

3984
01:41:21,370 --> 01:41:21,891
Oh yeah.

3985
01:41:21,891 --> 01:41:22,810
The animated Gif

3986
01:41:24,610 --> 01:41:25,443
make me laugh.

3987
01:41:26,170 --> 01:41:27,003
Or even like,

3988
01:41:27,310 --> 01:41:28,340
like someone over right.

3989
01:41:28,341 --> 01:41:32,200
A post to the thread and I'll look
down and the guy takes like an 80s,

3990
01:41:32,800 --> 01:41:33,650
1950s movie.

3991
01:41:33,651 --> 01:41:33,851
He goes,

3992
01:41:33,851 --> 01:41:34,390
get out,

3993
01:41:34,390 --> 01:41:34,900
get out,

3994
01:41:34,900 --> 01:41:35,740
get out with the word,

3995
01:41:35,741 --> 01:41:36,574
get out.

3996
01:41:38,120 --> 01:41:38,890
This is like,

3997
01:41:38,890 --> 01:41:39,880
oh my God.

3998
01:41:39,881 --> 01:41:44,881
It was a picture of me at the Wayans
came to Alaska to dos Santos and I,

3999
01:41:45,940 --> 01:41:47,180
when I'm at the weigh ins,

4000
01:41:47,220 --> 01:41:49,180
see for folks who,

4001
01:41:49,181 --> 01:41:49,590
uh,

4002
01:41:49,590 --> 01:41:51,190
like put it in perspective.

4003
01:41:51,220 --> 01:41:51,521
All right.

4004
01:41:51,521 --> 01:41:52,354
For me,

4005
01:41:52,670 --> 01:41:53,230
uh,

4006
01:41:53,230 --> 01:41:53,770
I'm a,

4007
01:41:53,770 --> 01:41:54,250
I'm a,

4008
01:41:54,250 --> 01:41:55,660
I'm a huge fight fan.

4009
01:41:55,690 --> 01:41:57,210
I've always been a
fight fan my whole life.

4010
01:41:57,211 --> 01:42:01,090
It's pretty obvious anybody sees me do
or he listens to me rather do commentary.

4011
01:42:01,480 --> 01:42:02,380
I don't have to fake,

4012
01:42:02,440 --> 01:42:02,740
like,

4013
01:42:02,740 --> 01:42:04,140
whether or not I'm excited about that,

4014
01:42:04,240 --> 01:42:04,800
that is,

4015
01:42:04,800 --> 01:42:05,230
um,

4016
01:42:05,230 --> 01:42:05,770
about,

4017
01:42:05,770 --> 01:42:06,011
oh,

4018
01:42:06,011 --> 01:42:07,450
I've always been obsessed with it.

4019
01:42:07,820 --> 01:42:08,260
Uh,

4020
01:42:08,260 --> 01:42:10,180
with the sport of mixed martial arts,

4021
01:42:10,181 --> 01:42:11,014
it's um,

4022
01:42:11,200 --> 01:42:11,740
you know,

4023
01:42:11,740 --> 01:42:16,740
to me it's the moment of the way in is
a really special aspect of that because

4024
01:42:19,091 --> 01:42:19,924
these guys,

4025
01:42:20,380 --> 01:42:24,130
they're going to circle around each
other and the hotels and the lobbies and

4026
01:42:24,131 --> 01:42:28,150
they might shake cans even they might
post for picture even they might have to

4027
01:42:28,151 --> 01:42:31,510
do some press shit together and they've
been thinking about nothing but each

4028
01:42:31,511 --> 01:42:32,350
other for six,

4029
01:42:32,380 --> 01:42:33,820
eight weeks,

4030
01:42:33,821 --> 01:42:34,654
even more,

4031
01:42:34,900 --> 01:42:35,230
you know,

4032
01:42:35,230 --> 01:42:36,280
I mean for some dudes,

4033
01:42:36,281 --> 01:42:38,410
so they're scheduling big
fights months in advance,

4034
01:42:38,411 --> 01:42:39,190
right?

4035
01:42:39,190 --> 01:42:43,450
And then they're standing there and
they get off that scale and they stepped

4036
01:42:43,451 --> 01:42:45,820
towards each other and hold their
knuckles in front of each other.

4037
01:42:45,910 --> 01:42:48,790
And they know that in less than 24 hours,

4038
01:42:48,791 --> 01:42:52,810
so a little bit more than
24 hours actually they're
going to throw down like all

4039
01:42:52,811 --> 01:42:54,340
this shit is coming to an end tomorrow.

4040
01:42:54,490 --> 01:42:57,400
And that moment right there is so intense.

4041
01:42:57,760 --> 01:42:59,770
You looking over at junior dos Santos,

4042
01:42:59,771 --> 01:43:01,690
he's a fucking killer.

4043
01:43:01,691 --> 01:43:05,410
He knocked Cain Velasquez down in
64 fucking seconds the first time.

4044
01:43:05,411 --> 01:43:05,920
They mean,

4045
01:43:05,920 --> 01:43:06,760
and then you see Cain,

4046
01:43:06,761 --> 01:43:10,420
who before that everybody thought was the
baddest motherfucker on two wheels and

4047
01:43:10,421 --> 01:43:11,800
it was going to be a really hard beat.

4048
01:43:11,801 --> 01:43:12,520
That guy,

4049
01:43:12,520 --> 01:43:13,280
everybody was thinking,

4050
01:43:13,280 --> 01:43:15,280
can't just going to put
that wrestling pace on you.

4051
01:43:15,430 --> 01:43:18,370
Keep shooting those doubles until you
were out and then hammer fist you into

4052
01:43:18,371 --> 01:43:18,941
oblivion.

4053
01:43:18,941 --> 01:43:20,080
And that's what he did to Jr.

4054
01:43:20,560 --> 01:43:22,060
But before this fight,

4055
01:43:22,061 --> 01:43:22,390
man,

4056
01:43:22,390 --> 01:43:22,720
you know,

4057
01:43:22,720 --> 01:43:25,900
you looked at the two of them and
there was so much on the line,

4058
01:43:25,901 --> 01:43:30,220
the UFC heavyweight title and the fact
that he had not cane out in the first

4059
01:43:30,221 --> 01:43:30,521
round,

4060
01:43:30,521 --> 01:43:31,301
the first fight,

4061
01:43:31,301 --> 01:43:36,190
and when Cain raised his knuckle up to
juniors face the same way junior does,

4062
01:43:36,191 --> 01:43:37,240
and they're just both stood,

4063
01:43:37,360 --> 01:43:38,650
stood their ground like that.

4064
01:43:39,100 --> 01:43:40,180
Woo.

4065
01:43:40,420 --> 01:43:41,290
God Damn,

4066
01:43:41,291 --> 01:43:43,120
there's some fucking energy in that room.

4067
01:43:43,620 --> 01:43:43,880
You're,

4068
01:43:43,880 --> 01:43:44,380
you're like,

4069
01:43:44,380 --> 01:43:47,290
this is going to be
some epic shit tomorrow.

4070
01:43:47,830 --> 01:43:49,600
The two of them just
staring at each other.

4071
01:43:49,601 --> 01:43:52,080
No one Blinken the two best

4072
01:43:52,080 --> 01:43:53,190
heavyweights on the planet,

4073
01:43:53,340 --> 01:43:55,410
right enough fucking throw bombs.

4074
01:43:56,640 --> 01:43:57,570
That's a funny video.

4075
01:43:57,630 --> 01:43:58,260
Funny.

4076
01:43:58,260 --> 01:43:58,711
Oh my God.

4077
01:43:58,711 --> 01:44:00,360
They took that picture
and put it on everything.

4078
01:44:01,930 --> 01:44:02,650
I was a,

4079
01:44:02,650 --> 01:44:04,440
I was coming out of women's Vaginas,

4080
01:44:04,750 --> 01:44:05,583
it's dying.

4081
01:44:06,140 --> 01:44:06,973
I was uh,

4082
01:44:07,010 --> 01:44:07,461
that's like,

4083
01:44:07,461 --> 01:44:09,770
to me that's the thing about like
the great thing about Emmy roasted.

4084
01:44:09,771 --> 01:44:10,604
Is that

4085
01:44:11,040 --> 01:44:14,940
like half to the fans are wrestlers
or did you do to people even more?

4086
01:44:14,941 --> 01:44:16,950
It's like I can never
get those people like,

4087
01:44:17,070 --> 01:44:18,330
like whatever in a room.

4088
01:44:18,331 --> 01:44:18,691
But in the,

4089
01:44:18,691 --> 01:44:23,250
on this thing that's like all these can
I see the belts are and the geese and

4090
01:44:23,320 --> 01:44:25,710
like I'm doing jokes that
like no one's going to get,

4091
01:44:25,711 --> 01:44:28,680
but those people or I mean
UFC fans like I'm like,

4092
01:44:28,681 --> 01:44:28,861
you know,

4093
01:44:28,861 --> 01:44:32,130
you know your watch too much MMA when
your girlfriend friends like to Banger and

4094
01:44:32,131 --> 01:44:34,270
you pass your guard and people like,

4095
01:44:34,300 --> 01:44:35,640
and people laugh at that
because they get it,

4096
01:44:35,641 --> 01:44:35,881
you know?

4097
01:44:35,881 --> 01:44:37,110
But if I did that on
the stage would be like,

4098
01:44:37,120 --> 01:44:37,810
what the what?

4099
01:44:37,810 --> 01:44:38,760
What's pastor guard?

4100
01:44:38,761 --> 01:44:39,511
What are you talking about?

4101
01:44:39,511 --> 01:44:40,170
You know?

4102
01:44:40,170 --> 01:44:43,410
So I feel like I'm speaking a language
that only see these people speak,

4103
01:44:43,710 --> 01:44:44,543
which is pretty cool.

4104
01:44:45,070 --> 01:44:49,480
You could open up my show and people would
understand about 99% would understand

4105
01:44:49,481 --> 01:44:50,490
what pastor gardening is.

4106
01:44:50,500 --> 01:44:50,870
Probably.

4107
01:44:50,870 --> 01:44:51,351
Yeah.

4108
01:44:51,351 --> 01:44:52,820
I mean that's like a,

4109
01:44:53,030 --> 01:44:53,570
to me that's,

4110
01:44:53,570 --> 01:44:56,840
that's the cool thing is that I'm able
to communicate with people that I never

4111
01:44:56,841 --> 01:44:59,660
thought I'd be able to communicate with
because there were actually guys would I

4112
01:44:59,690 --> 01:45:00,061
wrestle,

4113
01:45:00,061 --> 01:45:01,730
they wrestled or I did this or I train.

4114
01:45:01,731 --> 01:45:02,001
They train.

4115
01:45:02,001 --> 01:45:03,140
You know like I love UFC.

4116
01:45:03,141 --> 01:45:03,974
They love UFC.

4117
01:45:04,300 --> 01:45:05,590
What's it called again?

4118
01:45:05,660 --> 01:45:06,493
I don't know what happened.

4119
01:45:06,610 --> 01:45:07,550
Fuck man.

4120
01:45:07,940 --> 01:45:08,450
That out.

4121
01:45:08,450 --> 01:45:10,400
That is a beautiful
thing about the internet.

4122
01:45:10,401 --> 01:45:11,180
The fact that,

4123
01:45:11,180 --> 01:45:12,013
look at this

4124
01:45:14,750 --> 01:45:14,961
dude,

4125
01:45:14,961 --> 01:45:16,070
that is the funniest thing.

4126
01:45:19,510 --> 01:45:20,620
Pictures are ridiculous.

4127
01:45:22,900 --> 01:45:24,100
Beautiful thing about the Internet.

4128
01:45:24,101 --> 01:45:24,881
It said it kicked,

4129
01:45:24,881 --> 01:45:25,870
it creates,

4130
01:45:26,430 --> 01:45:27,700
these are really finally,

4131
01:45:28,930 --> 01:45:31,030
it creates some fucking,

4132
01:45:31,300 --> 01:45:32,290
forget what I'm saying.

4133
01:45:32,291 --> 01:45:33,124
Fuck it.

4134
01:45:37,970 --> 01:45:39,260
It creates communities.

4135
01:45:40,790 --> 01:45:42,080
Wrestlers can find each other.

4136
01:45:42,081 --> 01:45:43,190
You can find each other.

4137
01:45:43,191 --> 01:45:48,140
You know people that are in the comedy
or people are in the fucking whatever it

4138
01:45:48,141 --> 01:45:48,710
is.

4139
01:45:48,710 --> 01:45:49,543
Some of these people,

4140
01:45:49,700 --> 01:45:50,660
is that a real photo?

4141
01:45:50,661 --> 01:45:51,021
Pull up.

4142
01:45:51,021 --> 01:45:51,680
Pull that up.

4143
01:45:51,680 --> 01:45:52,140
The one,

4144
01:45:52,140 --> 01:45:56,540
how many different nutty things
that guy see that fucking guy,

4145
01:45:56,541 --> 01:45:57,374
the

4146
01:45:57,390 --> 01:45:59,830
the go bus people for.

4147
01:45:59,831 --> 01:46:00,300
Uh,

4148
01:46:00,300 --> 01:46:01,680
what the fuck is his name again?

4149
01:46:02,470 --> 01:46:03,161
Chris Hansen.

4150
01:46:03,161 --> 01:46:03,791
Chris Hardwick.

4151
01:46:03,791 --> 01:46:04,570
He says no,

4152
01:46:04,570 --> 01:46:07,180
Chris Hardwick is the
Nerdist you son of a bitch.

4153
01:46:07,840 --> 01:46:08,710
Chris Hansen.

4154
01:46:09,220 --> 01:46:09,970
Um,

4155
01:46:09,970 --> 01:46:10,690
Chris Hardwick's.

4156
01:46:10,690 --> 01:46:11,141
Good guy.

4157
01:46:11,141 --> 01:46:11,974
How dare you?

4158
01:46:12,310 --> 01:46:13,420
How dare you?

4159
01:46:13,860 --> 01:46:14,420
Um,

4160
01:46:14,420 --> 01:46:16,750
Krista answered how much fucked
up shit that that guy say.

4161
01:46:16,900 --> 01:46:20,680
I mean that guy saw like one child rapist
after another over and over and over

4162
01:46:20,681 --> 01:46:21,514
again.

4163
01:46:21,690 --> 01:46:22,061
The guys.

4164
01:46:22,061 --> 01:46:23,720
So unlikable you almost
route for the Predator,

4165
01:46:24,850 --> 01:46:25,190
right?

4166
01:46:25,190 --> 01:46:27,200
There's something about that
guy that like you ended up,

4167
01:46:27,410 --> 01:46:28,260
he's a creepy dude.

4168
01:46:28,610 --> 01:46:29,020
Yeah.

4169
01:46:29,020 --> 01:46:29,211
Yeah.

4170
01:46:29,211 --> 01:46:30,460
The guy from cheaters and hen both.

4171
01:46:30,480 --> 01:46:32,180
And have you do a show where
you go around Boston people?

4172
01:46:32,400 --> 01:46:32,650
Well,

4173
01:46:32,650 --> 01:46:36,090
Bob Dunkin interviewed the
guy from cheaters recently.

4174
01:46:36,120 --> 01:46:37,740
He said it was a really good podcast.

4175
01:46:37,741 --> 01:46:39,510
He said the guy was surprisingly smart.

4176
01:46:39,540 --> 01:46:40,020
I'm sure.

4177
01:46:40,020 --> 01:46:41,220
Said it was really interesting.

4178
01:46:41,450 --> 01:46:41,930
Oh,

4179
01:46:41,930 --> 01:46:43,680
you want me just putting it out there?

4180
01:46:43,710 --> 01:46:43,831
No,

4181
01:46:43,831 --> 01:46:44,250
I'm serious.

4182
01:46:44,250 --> 01:46:45,060
Probably was mine.

4183
01:46:45,060 --> 01:46:46,740
I think a lot of that
show was bullshit too.

4184
01:46:46,741 --> 01:46:47,530
Like big,

4185
01:46:47,530 --> 01:46:48,363
big stab.

4186
01:46:48,540 --> 01:46:49,590
It was that Bro.

4187
01:46:49,620 --> 01:46:49,950
Yeah.

4188
01:46:49,950 --> 01:46:50,490
You think so?

4189
01:46:50,490 --> 01:46:50,810
Yeah.

4190
01:46:50,810 --> 01:46:51,130
Um,

4191
01:46:51,130 --> 01:46:51,810
man,

4192
01:46:51,810 --> 01:46:53,430
I don't think you're
allowed to fix damage.

4193
01:46:54,270 --> 01:46:58,290
They would have to be like a
police record on a past podcast.

4194
01:46:58,440 --> 01:46:59,300
It's really ridiculous.

4195
01:46:59,760 --> 01:47:00,710
Really think it's fake.

4196
01:47:00,770 --> 01:47:01,603
Yeah.

4197
01:47:02,450 --> 01:47:03,780
But I think you went to the hospital.

4198
01:47:04,890 --> 01:47:05,723
No.

4199
01:47:05,940 --> 01:47:07,410
Brian calls fake and everything though.

4200
01:47:07,770 --> 01:47:08,850
He's right a lot though.

4201
01:47:09,570 --> 01:47:10,141
He gets it right.

4202
01:47:10,141 --> 01:47:10,530
A lot.

4203
01:47:10,530 --> 01:47:11,820
A lot of fake shit on the Internet.

4204
01:47:12,030 --> 01:47:12,600
Okay.

4205
01:47:12,600 --> 01:47:14,070
Don't be fooled out of hunter.

4206
01:47:14,130 --> 01:47:14,411
Uh,

4207
01:47:14,411 --> 01:47:15,244
no,

4208
01:47:15,480 --> 01:47:16,050
it's true.

4209
01:47:16,050 --> 01:47:17,490
So these videos that you're doing,

4210
01:47:17,880 --> 01:47:18,930
how many of those are you gonna do

4211
01:47:19,550 --> 01:47:20,230
and they arrested?

4212
01:47:20,230 --> 01:47:20,690
Yeah.

4213
01:47:20,690 --> 01:47:21,081
Uh,

4214
01:47:21,081 --> 01:47:22,040
I'm going to keep putting it out there.

4215
01:47:22,041 --> 01:47:22,191
I mean,

4216
01:47:22,191 --> 01:47:22,690
I love it.

4217
01:47:22,690 --> 01:47:23,061
You know,

4218
01:47:23,061 --> 01:47:23,631
I love doing it.

4219
01:47:23,631 --> 01:47:24,170
It's fun.

4220
01:47:24,170 --> 01:47:25,310
I wish they got more heads.

4221
01:47:25,490 --> 01:47:26,323
Uh,

4222
01:47:26,480 --> 01:47:28,530
everybody wishes they were
more successful at a monitor.

4223
01:47:28,680 --> 01:47:29,000
I,

4224
01:47:29,000 --> 01:47:30,380
everybody wishes it got more hits.

4225
01:47:30,770 --> 01:47:32,570
Everybody wishes their
tweets were read by more.

4226
01:47:32,660 --> 01:47:33,380
I know,

4227
01:47:33,380 --> 01:47:33,840
I know.

4228
01:47:33,840 --> 01:47:34,673
There are a lot of time wishing.

4229
01:47:34,760 --> 01:47:36,410
I wish it would pick
it a well or something.

4230
01:47:36,900 --> 01:47:37,470
Uh,

4231
01:47:37,470 --> 01:47:38,061
but yeah,

4232
01:47:38,061 --> 01:47:38,801
I'm going to keep doing them.

4233
01:47:38,801 --> 01:47:39,560
And I,

4234
01:47:39,560 --> 01:47:40,280
I enjoy,

4235
01:47:40,280 --> 01:47:43,280
I enjoy watching the fights and you're
having a reason to why is fades and,

4236
01:47:43,281 --> 01:47:43,461
uh,

4237
01:47:43,461 --> 01:47:43,671
I'm,

4238
01:47:43,671 --> 01:47:45,170
I'm producing a pilot now.

4239
01:47:45,200 --> 01:47:46,250
Hopefully the EOC will,

4240
01:47:47,180 --> 01:47:49,730
it's gonna you know where
it's like a Kelsey lately,

4241
01:47:49,731 --> 01:47:50,564
but about Mia.

4242
01:47:50,750 --> 01:47:51,440
Really?

4243
01:47:51,440 --> 01:47:51,561
Oh,

4244
01:47:51,561 --> 01:47:52,390
that's funny.

4245
01:47:52,390 --> 01:47:53,220
And it's a,

4246
01:47:53,220 --> 01:47:54,080
and me and a triple,

4247
01:47:54,081 --> 01:47:55,610
you're working on it and Joey Varner,

4248
01:47:55,880 --> 01:47:56,940
so we'll just go,

4249
01:47:56,990 --> 01:47:57,710
it's going to be great.

4250
01:47:57,710 --> 01:48:01,130
That's interesting because it really
is only alert couple of Emily's shows,

4251
01:48:01,730 --> 01:48:02,690
no comedy shows,

4252
01:48:02,740 --> 01:48:03,950
like there's funny aspects of shows,

4253
01:48:03,951 --> 01:48:05,330
but there's no strictly content.

4254
01:48:05,600 --> 01:48:08,900
So I think this will be good because you
do the topics in a day and a monologue

4255
01:48:10,880 --> 01:48:12,620
on the spike show.

4256
01:48:12,710 --> 01:48:13,543
The bald guy.

4257
01:48:13,760 --> 01:48:14,480
Yeah.

4258
01:48:14,480 --> 01:48:15,470
He isn't he like,

4259
01:48:15,560 --> 01:48:19,850
he's not a comedian or is it radio has
to be like either radio guy by the,

4260
01:48:19,851 --> 01:48:21,260
he think he's trying to be like,

4261
01:48:21,261 --> 01:48:21,640
uh,

4262
01:48:21,640 --> 01:48:23,380
the guy in ESPN who's trying to be like

4263
01:48:25,650 --> 01:48:26,480
the grumpy,

4264
01:48:26,480 --> 01:48:27,440
disgruntled Fan.

4265
01:48:29,590 --> 01:48:30,560
I watch some of this stuff.

4266
01:48:30,561 --> 01:48:31,880
It was a little bit like I wouldn't,

4267
01:48:31,910 --> 01:48:32,810
I would take a different path.

4268
01:48:32,870 --> 01:48:33,420
You know,

4269
01:48:33,420 --> 01:48:33,830
I,

4270
01:48:33,830 --> 01:48:35,900
I try not to be disrespectful ever.

4271
01:48:35,960 --> 01:48:37,370
Well that's a sports guy thing.

4272
01:48:37,400 --> 01:48:40,820
A lot of those soft sports guys like the
shit all over the players and they've

4273
01:48:40,821 --> 01:48:41,654
never played anything.

4274
01:48:42,100 --> 01:48:42,410
Never.

4275
01:48:42,410 --> 01:48:45,110
I mean I think because I mean I'm
not saying I got to go to high level

4276
01:48:45,120 --> 01:48:45,591
wrestling,

4277
01:48:45,591 --> 01:48:47,510
but I didn't get to like
high level wrestling,

4278
01:48:47,511 --> 01:48:47,960
you know,

4279
01:48:47,960 --> 01:48:48,501
what does that mean?

4280
01:48:48,501 --> 01:48:50,030
So you just contradicted yourself.

4281
01:48:50,650 --> 01:48:54,920
I won the New England's a prep
school four years in a row.

4282
01:48:54,950 --> 01:48:55,940
I was only the third person,

4283
01:48:55,941 --> 01:48:56,480
never do it.

4284
01:48:56,480 --> 01:48:56,951
And then I,

4285
01:48:56,951 --> 01:49:00,560
I won the all New England twice and
then got a scholarship to a hospital

4286
01:49:00,900 --> 01:49:01,820
typically by Tom Ryan.

4287
01:49:01,910 --> 01:49:02,571
But I didn't take it.

4288
01:49:02,571 --> 01:49:05,870
I went to bank so I've got to a high level
but I didn't get to a high level like

4289
01:49:06,290 --> 01:49:07,200
the Olympics.

4290
01:49:07,200 --> 01:49:11,000
The Olympics are Nash Division
One e three for like a semester.

4291
01:49:11,050 --> 01:49:11,261
You know,

4292
01:49:11,261 --> 01:49:12,041
I get to like a year.

4293
01:49:12,041 --> 01:49:15,050
I favor Johny Hendricks.

4294
01:49:15,051 --> 01:49:15,640
And that's a,

4295
01:49:15,640 --> 01:49:16,490
that's a different level.

4296
01:49:17,110 --> 01:49:17,480
What's the,

4297
01:49:17,480 --> 01:49:21,020
what do you think separates
a guy like Johnny Hendricks?

4298
01:49:21,021 --> 01:49:21,181
Like,

4299
01:49:21,181 --> 01:49:21,430
oh,

4300
01:49:21,430 --> 01:49:24,800
a real high level guy who was very
successful as an amateur wrestler.

4301
01:49:25,040 --> 01:49:26,930
What do you think separates him from,

4302
01:49:26,960 --> 01:49:30,110
from other like it like I look like I
take Rockhold is something who is very

4303
01:49:30,111 --> 01:49:33,370
high level wrestler but didn't but
didn't succeed UFC sort of is that no,

4304
01:49:33,380 --> 01:49:33,591
no,

4305
01:49:33,591 --> 01:49:33,831
no,

4306
01:49:33,831 --> 01:49:34,280
no.

4307
01:49:34,280 --> 01:49:37,890
I mean what's the difference
between a guy like that and uh,

4308
01:49:38,030 --> 01:49:38,541
you know,

4309
01:49:38,541 --> 01:49:38,841
a,

4310
01:49:38,841 --> 01:49:41,780
a d three wrestler or a guy who's not,

4311
01:49:41,960 --> 01:49:42,530
you know,

4312
01:49:42,530 --> 01:49:44,500
not to offend any d three
wrestlers cause I don't,

4313
01:49:44,830 --> 01:49:48,110
I'd have to be careful with this because
some of them are talented to your tough

4314
01:49:48,110 --> 01:49:49,280
with some of our super top right.

4315
01:49:49,340 --> 01:49:49,881
72.

4316
01:49:49,881 --> 01:49:51,360
I mean it's like Cain car,

4317
01:49:51,370 --> 01:49:51,901
it's your car.

4318
01:49:51,901 --> 01:49:54,260
One was a dick at d two
wrestler or a d three maybe.

4319
01:49:54,280 --> 01:49:55,120
Then Phd too,

4320
01:49:55,380 --> 01:49:55,800
you know,

4321
01:49:55,800 --> 01:49:58,350
and some of the got Connor hewn and the
friend of mine was a d three wrestler

4322
01:49:58,370 --> 01:49:59,203
and you're tough as hell.

4323
01:49:59,490 --> 01:50:01,770
I just think d one it's just a,

4324
01:50:02,360 --> 01:50:06,150
it's the practices are
probably the better caliber

4325
01:50:07,810 --> 01:50:08,140
one.

4326
01:50:08,140 --> 01:50:09,070
It's essentially,

4327
01:50:09,071 --> 01:50:12,010
if you want to be a competitive
wrestler and you were in high school,

4328
01:50:12,011 --> 01:50:13,960
you look for a d one college

4329
01:50:14,610 --> 01:50:18,120
versus a d three college
limbic team or something.

4330
01:50:18,480 --> 01:50:21,420
The reason I chose Binghamton
for me was I was like,

4331
01:50:21,421 --> 01:50:22,050
well,

4332
01:50:22,050 --> 01:50:25,290
I don't want to take up my whole life
but I still want to wrestle so I don't

4333
01:50:25,291 --> 01:50:27,270
want to have it all year round.

4334
01:50:27,540 --> 01:50:30,090
I don't want to do it a couple months out
of the year and I still want to write.

4335
01:50:30,120 --> 01:50:31,560
But it was still my whole life.

4336
01:50:31,620 --> 01:50:33,090
It was like once I got there,

4337
01:50:33,380 --> 01:50:35,400
because it's the kind of sport
you're as good as you want to be.

4338
01:50:35,550 --> 01:50:36,720
It's your whole life,

4339
01:50:36,750 --> 01:50:37,081
you know?

4340
01:50:37,081 --> 01:50:37,914
So,

4341
01:50:38,160 --> 01:50:39,240
but I would say like,

4342
01:50:39,241 --> 01:50:39,440
uh,

4343
01:50:39,440 --> 01:50:42,860
like Matt Hamill start off with a d one
wrestler placed on the all new hurricane

4344
01:50:42,920 --> 01:50:43,531
went d three,

4345
01:50:43,531 --> 01:50:46,080
I think he wanted like two years
in a row or three years ago.

4346
01:50:46,620 --> 01:50:48,390
So it just,

4347
01:50:48,580 --> 01:50:49,590
it's a harder level,

4348
01:50:49,800 --> 01:50:50,160
you know,

4349
01:50:50,160 --> 01:50:50,670
it's a better,

4350
01:50:50,670 --> 01:50:52,290
but a guy like Johnny Hendricks,

4351
01:50:52,630 --> 01:50:53,463
why are we on this?

4352
01:50:53,520 --> 01:50:55,390
What was the difference?

4353
01:50:55,391 --> 01:50:55,550
Like,

4354
01:50:55,550 --> 01:50:55,890
Oh yeah,

4355
01:50:55,890 --> 01:50:56,920
that makes a guy,

4356
01:50:57,720 --> 01:50:59,250
I mean just more,

4357
01:50:59,280 --> 01:51:00,330
more hours of practice.

4358
01:51:00,810 --> 01:51:01,371
That's all it is,

4359
01:51:01,371 --> 01:51:01,950
you think?

4360
01:51:01,950 --> 01:51:02,783
I think so.

4361
01:51:02,820 --> 01:51:03,140
I mean,

4362
01:51:03,140 --> 01:51:05,670
cause some of those you got to go with,

4363
01:51:05,671 --> 01:51:07,780
well what testament of like wills,

4364
01:51:08,160 --> 01:51:09,570
how much did they love it too?

4365
01:51:09,660 --> 01:51:10,493
You know,

4366
01:51:10,560 --> 01:51:11,880
like I loved wrestling,

4367
01:51:11,940 --> 01:51:15,630
but I also love the attention that I was
getting in high school from it because

4368
01:51:15,631 --> 01:51:17,670
it was a small school
when I was a big star,

4369
01:51:17,671 --> 01:51:18,810
big fish in a small pond.

4370
01:51:19,170 --> 01:51:20,003
When I got to college,

4371
01:51:20,010 --> 01:51:21,780
no one really gave a fuck about wrestling.

4372
01:51:21,900 --> 01:51:24,960
It was like one of those sports except
for the wrestlers and a couple of

4373
01:51:24,961 --> 01:51:25,411
groupies.

4374
01:51:25,411 --> 01:51:26,244
But it wasn't like,

4375
01:51:26,670 --> 01:51:27,960
it wasn't like I was in high school,

4376
01:51:28,110 --> 01:51:29,850
so I miss being that star kind of.

4377
01:51:29,851 --> 01:51:30,151
And I was like,

4378
01:51:30,151 --> 01:51:31,290
well it's not gonna be the star.

4379
01:51:31,330 --> 01:51:31,980
Yeah.

4380
01:51:31,980 --> 01:51:32,611
Oh really?

4381
01:51:32,611 --> 01:51:33,091
That's funny.

4382
01:51:33,091 --> 01:51:34,170
What a needy bitch you are.

4383
01:51:34,410 --> 01:51:35,140
I hate to,

4384
01:51:35,140 --> 01:51:36,390
I hate to admit this,

4385
01:51:36,391 --> 01:51:37,224
I mean

4386
01:51:37,970 --> 01:51:38,511
freshing Lee,

4387
01:51:38,511 --> 01:51:40,670
honest and in a normal
way of thinking too,

4388
01:51:40,671 --> 01:51:41,420
by the way,

4389
01:51:41,420 --> 01:51:41,930
you know,

4390
01:51:41,930 --> 01:51:43,270
nobody wants to do something where they,

4391
01:51:43,340 --> 01:51:46,640
I mean there's a lot of people that are
doing sports at a very obscure and they

4392
01:51:46,641 --> 01:51:48,860
have like an inferiority
complex about that.

4393
01:51:49,200 --> 01:51:49,600
You know,

4394
01:51:49,600 --> 01:51:53,030
like you ever talked to someone who does
like an obscure sport and they're like,

4395
01:51:53,031 --> 01:51:53,864
they put a call out,

4396
01:51:54,200 --> 01:51:56,720
we play three cushioned billiards or
stuff like that and want to tell you how

4397
01:51:56,721 --> 01:51:57,554
awesome it is.

4398
01:51:57,930 --> 01:51:58,280
You know?

4399
01:51:58,280 --> 01:51:58,611
It's a,

4400
01:51:58,611 --> 01:51:59,110
it's,

4401
01:51:59,110 --> 01:51:59,721
it's weird.

4402
01:51:59,721 --> 01:52:01,700
They like have like insecurities.

4403
01:52:01,830 --> 01:52:02,400
Oh yeah.

4404
01:52:02,400 --> 01:52:03,233
Well that's the thing.

4405
01:52:03,240 --> 01:52:04,073
I think anytime.

4406
01:52:04,170 --> 01:52:05,520
I think any time you
were an athlete though,

4407
01:52:05,521 --> 01:52:06,660
and you'd like,

4408
01:52:06,661 --> 01:52:06,901
to me,

4409
01:52:06,901 --> 01:52:07,320
I was,

4410
01:52:07,320 --> 01:52:08,700
I felt like an average kid,

4411
01:52:08,910 --> 01:52:10,030
but then when I got wrestling I was,

4412
01:52:10,031 --> 01:52:11,610
all of a sudden it's
something made me special.

4413
01:52:11,850 --> 01:52:12,221
Right.

4414
01:52:12,221 --> 01:52:13,054
You know,

4415
01:52:13,290 --> 01:52:13,780
and I need,

4416
01:52:13,780 --> 01:52:14,880
then you don't rest it more to like,

4417
01:52:14,970 --> 01:52:15,241
to me,

4418
01:52:15,241 --> 01:52:16,440
I didn't feel special anymore,

4419
01:52:16,460 --> 01:52:16,830
you know?

4420
01:52:16,830 --> 01:52:17,011
Yeah.

4421
01:52:17,011 --> 01:52:17,270
Yeah.

4422
01:52:17,270 --> 01:52:17,871
And you know what,

4423
01:52:17,871 --> 01:52:18,111
that's,

4424
01:52:18,111 --> 01:52:18,470
I'm going,

4425
01:52:18,470 --> 01:52:19,350
I'm going to call genedy bitch.

4426
01:52:19,351 --> 01:52:19,511
You know,

4427
01:52:19,511 --> 01:52:21,860
I'm only talking around because
I was exactly the same way,

4428
01:52:21,960 --> 01:52:22,160
uh,

4429
01:52:22,160 --> 01:52:23,510
100% the same way.

4430
01:52:23,960 --> 01:52:24,440
Um,

4431
01:52:24,440 --> 01:52:27,410
and growing up when I
started doing martial arts,

4432
01:52:27,411 --> 01:52:29,450
it was the only time I ever
felt like I was worth anything.

4433
01:52:29,451 --> 01:52:29,600
Like,

4434
01:52:29,600 --> 01:52:31,370
because everything else that I had done,

4435
01:52:31,940 --> 01:52:32,690
I mean,

4436
01:52:32,690 --> 01:52:36,650
I was when I was like 15 years old
when I got serious about martial arts.

4437
01:52:36,890 --> 01:52:37,521
But other than that,

4438
01:52:37,521 --> 01:52:38,360
anything else I had done.

4439
01:52:38,361 --> 01:52:39,111
It was just like art,

4440
01:52:39,111 --> 01:52:40,130
like artistic stuff.

4441
01:52:40,131 --> 01:52:42,290
But I didn't know if there
was any future in that.

4442
01:52:42,291 --> 01:52:42,621
I didn't know.

4443
01:52:42,621 --> 01:52:42,900
Like I,

4444
01:52:42,900 --> 01:52:43,910
I thought it was a loser,

4445
01:52:44,080 --> 01:52:44,760
you know?

4446
01:52:44,760 --> 01:52:46,330
So getting good at something,

4447
01:52:46,360 --> 01:52:47,150
anything.

4448
01:52:47,150 --> 01:52:49,030
It was like what gave me my identity.

4449
01:52:49,110 --> 01:52:49,943
Yeah.

4450
01:52:50,050 --> 01:52:50,290
You know,

4451
01:52:50,290 --> 01:52:51,760
I think that happens for a lot of guys,

4452
01:52:51,761 --> 01:52:54,370
especially guys like you
or I that grew up without,

4453
01:52:54,510 --> 01:52:54,821
you know,

4454
01:52:54,821 --> 01:52:55,900
one of our family members.

4455
01:52:56,460 --> 01:52:57,050
You know,

4456
01:52:57,050 --> 01:52:57,310
I,

4457
01:52:57,310 --> 01:52:58,470
the good thing about wrestling though,

4458
01:52:58,471 --> 01:53:03,390
for me it was that not to knock a
water polo or another obscure sport,

4459
01:53:03,630 --> 01:53:07,230
but is that it really did
teach you cap out character.

4460
01:53:07,231 --> 01:53:07,501
Like,

4461
01:53:07,501 --> 01:53:08,310
Holy Fuck,

4462
01:53:08,310 --> 01:53:10,390
well I'm sure water polo
would teach a character too.

4463
01:53:10,391 --> 01:53:10,470
Right.

4464
01:53:10,470 --> 01:53:11,730
But there's a different level.

4465
01:53:12,270 --> 01:53:13,140
There's a different level.

4466
01:53:13,200 --> 01:53:14,080
The level of,

4467
01:53:14,081 --> 01:53:14,320
uh,

4468
01:53:14,320 --> 01:53:16,470
not just tenacity,

4469
01:53:16,500 --> 01:53:21,500
but the ability to endure hardship and
the ability to overcome uncomfortable

4470
01:53:22,021 --> 01:53:22,890
situations.

4471
01:53:23,010 --> 01:53:26,090
I know a lot of wrestlers from highschool
that fucked her body up in high

4472
01:53:26,091 --> 01:53:26,460
school,

4473
01:53:26,460 --> 01:53:26,850
man,

4474
01:53:26,850 --> 01:53:30,450
dehydrated themselves to the point they
look like zombies are walking around and

4475
01:53:30,451 --> 01:53:31,810
couldn't eat in the wrong way.

4476
01:53:31,811 --> 01:53:33,210
Class is getting pummeled on,

4477
01:53:33,380 --> 01:53:34,380
on the mat because of it.

4478
01:53:34,381 --> 01:53:36,000
Every day I watched these guys,

4479
01:53:36,001 --> 01:53:39,390
like I watched a dude who was assault
brought all his brothers like six,

4480
01:53:39,391 --> 01:53:39,841
two,

4481
01:53:39,841 --> 01:53:41,530
six one six two big giant guy.

4482
01:53:41,790 --> 01:53:42,361
He's like five,

4483
01:53:42,361 --> 01:53:42,691
five,

4484
01:53:42,691 --> 01:53:42,901
five,

4485
01:53:42,901 --> 01:53:43,330
six.

4486
01:53:43,330 --> 01:53:43,850
That's I,

4487
01:53:43,850 --> 01:53:44,880
I'm sure I did that like,

4488
01:53:44,970 --> 01:53:46,620
cause he was constantly dieting

4489
01:53:46,720 --> 01:53:47,690
that though the way cut though.

4490
01:53:47,691 --> 01:53:48,524
Like they,

4491
01:53:48,610 --> 01:53:48,940
you know,

4492
01:53:48,940 --> 01:53:52,640
I would be 18 pounds one
week before the match.

4493
01:53:52,641 --> 01:53:53,200
Yeah.

4494
01:53:53,200 --> 01:53:54,110
And then it was like,

4495
01:53:54,280 --> 01:53:54,730
okay,

4496
01:53:54,730 --> 01:53:56,620
just eating to strictly salad,

4497
01:53:56,650 --> 01:53:57,610
not even anything else.

4498
01:53:57,670 --> 01:53:58,010
Yeah.

4499
01:53:58,010 --> 01:53:59,170
It spitting in a cup all day,

4500
01:53:59,260 --> 01:54:00,430
sleeping with the windows,

4501
01:54:00,431 --> 01:54:01,330
open the shiver off,

4502
01:54:01,331 --> 01:54:02,350
wait while you sleep.

4503
01:54:02,880 --> 01:54:03,713
Um,

4504
01:54:03,780 --> 01:54:08,780
putting in the heat up to like 110 and
then and then try and put as much layers

4505
01:54:10,570 --> 01:54:11,690
on so that I would like sweat.

4506
01:54:11,840 --> 01:54:14,530
And then a couple of kids my year
died from jump everything in the,

4507
01:54:14,540 --> 01:54:16,360
in the shower with the steam on,

4508
01:54:16,690 --> 01:54:19,750
they passed out fucking Christ.

4509
01:54:19,751 --> 01:54:20,590
So uh,

4510
01:54:20,950 --> 01:54:21,640
yeah that was,

4511
01:54:21,640 --> 01:54:22,301
that was brutal.

4512
01:54:22,301 --> 01:54:23,660
But that to me when,

4513
01:54:23,680 --> 01:54:25,300
when I used to call in
the match at the college,

4514
01:54:25,310 --> 01:54:26,920
the 10 matches I had,

4515
01:54:27,370 --> 01:54:28,930
because that's what kind of wanted
to prove that the restaurant,

4516
01:54:28,960 --> 01:54:30,820
the college level and
then stop in some ways.

4517
01:54:30,820 --> 01:54:32,320
Cause that was what was
called the prep school champ,

4518
01:54:32,321 --> 01:54:32,621
you know,

4519
01:54:32,621 --> 01:54:33,454
versus like,

4520
01:54:33,700 --> 01:54:36,040
but once I went out there
and you're so hungry,

4521
01:54:36,070 --> 01:54:37,270
you want to kill the fucking guy.

4522
01:54:37,300 --> 01:54:37,781
Like I'm like,

4523
01:54:37,781 --> 01:54:39,400
you made me fucking star for fuck.

4524
01:54:39,610 --> 01:54:41,080
I was getting pussy before wrestling.

4525
01:54:41,320 --> 01:54:44,000
I was going against the anger
and pussy with this guy again.

4526
01:54:44,490 --> 01:54:45,100
I'm Sam.

4527
01:54:45,100 --> 01:54:46,780
I was like finger down fucking hard.

4528
01:54:46,920 --> 01:54:49,420
Like I'm going to fucking kill
this person in front of me.

4529
01:54:49,440 --> 01:54:49,960
Like,

4530
01:54:49,960 --> 01:54:50,261
like,

4531
01:54:50,261 --> 01:54:51,580
cause this fucker made me starve.

4532
01:54:51,610 --> 01:54:51,941
I'm going to,

4533
01:54:51,941 --> 01:54:52,680
I'm going to kill him.

4534
01:54:52,680 --> 01:54:53,380
So you would get,

4535
01:54:53,380 --> 01:54:55,690
you would actually get like
real anger at your opponents.

4536
01:54:56,290 --> 01:54:57,240
I was named get myself,

4537
01:54:57,250 --> 01:54:57,940
my opponent,

4538
01:54:57,940 --> 01:54:58,630
my life,

4539
01:54:58,630 --> 01:54:59,890
the whole world because they made,

4540
01:54:59,920 --> 01:55:00,401
I was like,

4541
01:55:00,401 --> 01:55:00,730
fuck.

4542
01:55:00,730 --> 01:55:02,980
Like they made you do what you're doing.

4543
01:55:03,220 --> 01:55:04,060
They didn't make me do shit.

4544
01:55:04,061 --> 01:55:04,811
I made myself.

4545
01:55:04,811 --> 01:55:05,640
I was the angry,

4546
01:55:05,640 --> 01:55:06,130
whatever it is.

4547
01:55:06,130 --> 01:55:06,930
I couldn't eat.

4548
01:55:06,930 --> 01:55:08,020
Eating was like brutal.

4549
01:55:08,190 --> 01:55:09,550
I'm too logical for that.

4550
01:55:10,530 --> 01:55:12,070
I'd never got angry at opponents,

4551
01:55:12,071 --> 01:55:12,540
but I,

4552
01:55:12,540 --> 01:55:12,940
I,

4553
01:55:12,940 --> 01:55:15,310
I would get angry at
myself if I fucked up.

4554
01:55:15,311 --> 01:55:17,230
I would get in of myself if I lost,

4555
01:55:17,231 --> 01:55:20,530
but I don't remember ever really being
angry at being a dick that people take a

4556
01:55:20,531 --> 01:55:21,150
bad shot.

4557
01:55:21,150 --> 01:55:22,270
I would clap at them.

4558
01:55:22,360 --> 01:55:22,541
I'm like,

4559
01:55:22,541 --> 01:55:23,350
Oh really?

4560
01:55:23,350 --> 01:55:24,260
Like while you were wrestling,

4561
01:55:24,261 --> 01:55:27,850
I was wrestling and the
head like not even shoot,

4562
01:55:27,851 --> 01:55:29,050
just to fucking punch him in the head.

4563
01:55:29,070 --> 01:55:29,903
Like wow.

4564
01:55:30,480 --> 01:55:33,040
My first and my middle school
wrestling team and long island,

4565
01:55:33,370 --> 01:55:34,360
we were like the worst.

4566
01:55:34,570 --> 01:55:36,070
Like every kid was a bad sport.

4567
01:55:36,071 --> 01:55:40,210
We all cry and we lost and throw chairs
and like just curse out the other coach.

4568
01:55:40,950 --> 01:55:42,040
I didn't want to got to boarding school.

4569
01:55:42,041 --> 01:55:42,551
I tried that.

4570
01:55:42,551 --> 01:55:46,130
My first match I lost and I threw a
chair and they keep going up the team for

4571
01:55:46,131 --> 01:55:46,340
like,

4572
01:55:46,340 --> 01:55:46,620
they're like,

4573
01:55:46,620 --> 01:55:48,200
you made me pick up rocks for an hour.

4574
01:55:48,230 --> 01:55:52,850
One of the really good things about
doing taekwondo as an organized sport was

4575
01:55:52,851 --> 01:55:54,890
that the school that I did it with,

4576
01:55:54,920 --> 01:55:56,900
they were really big on manners.

4577
01:55:57,200 --> 01:55:59,720
They were really big on
calling everyone sir.

4578
01:56:00,170 --> 01:56:02,450
It was Mr. Kim and Mr O'malley.

4579
01:56:02,451 --> 01:56:04,700
And when they talked to
you is yes sir and no sir.

4580
01:56:04,970 --> 01:56:09,970
So because like they enforced this sort
of code of conduct and your in your

4581
01:56:10,581 --> 01:56:11,414
behavior,

4582
01:56:11,720 --> 01:56:13,400
it made me like,

4583
01:56:13,550 --> 01:56:18,550
like behave like way better in competition
than I would if I was just all wild

4584
01:56:19,311 --> 01:56:20,690
and willy nilly like a wrestler.

4585
01:56:20,860 --> 01:56:21,693
Oh yeah.

4586
01:56:22,060 --> 01:56:22,810
And then,

4587
01:56:22,810 --> 01:56:26,290
but then I got to college and then I
lost my third match that throw the chair

4588
01:56:26,291 --> 01:56:27,110
again,

4589
01:56:27,110 --> 01:56:27,943
went right back to

4590
01:56:28,250 --> 01:56:30,350
when did you calm down because you know,

4591
01:56:30,351 --> 01:56:31,760
you're a pretty calm guy now.

4592
01:56:31,900 --> 01:56:32,441
Yeah.

4593
01:56:32,441 --> 01:56:33,100
I mean,

4594
01:56:33,100 --> 01:56:33,851
although like Ah,

4595
01:56:33,851 --> 01:56:34,300
I got,

4596
01:56:34,300 --> 01:56:34,870
you know,

4597
01:56:34,870 --> 01:56:36,340
that fight I got into
it with the other comic.

4598
01:56:36,530 --> 01:56:37,150
Yeah.

4599
01:56:37,150 --> 01:56:37,983
That other comic.

4600
01:56:38,050 --> 01:56:39,250
That's unfortunate.

4601
01:56:39,900 --> 01:56:43,260
The most unfortunate thing is what he
said to you while you guys were doing it.

4602
01:56:43,261 --> 01:56:43,991
I took his joke,

4603
01:56:43,991 --> 01:56:44,310
right?

4604
01:56:44,310 --> 01:56:44,430
No,

4605
01:56:44,430 --> 01:56:44,510
no,

4606
01:56:44,510 --> 01:56:44,651
no,

4607
01:56:44,651 --> 01:56:45,484
not even that.

4608
01:56:46,270 --> 01:56:46,950
Held together.

4609
01:56:46,950 --> 01:56:47,210
Yeah.

4610
01:56:47,210 --> 01:56:51,250
Could you imagine that a guy is attacking
you and he says we'd done tonight.

4611
01:56:51,251 --> 01:56:52,090
We dine in hell.

4612
01:56:52,380 --> 01:56:52,570
Yeah.

4613
01:56:52,570 --> 01:56:53,403
And I was like,

4614
01:56:53,470 --> 01:56:54,610
that's what he said tonight.

4615
01:56:54,611 --> 01:56:54,941
We'd done it.

4616
01:56:54,941 --> 01:56:55,240
How,

4617
01:56:55,240 --> 01:56:56,350
how drunk is that dude?

4618
01:56:56,590 --> 01:56:58,870
I mean he's quoting movies from the 90s.

4619
01:56:59,050 --> 01:56:59,261
Well,

4620
01:56:59,261 --> 01:57:01,660
what movie was that
tonight we'd done in hell.

4621
01:57:01,760 --> 01:57:01,960
Uh,

4622
01:57:01,960 --> 01:57:03,280
it was that gladiator.

4623
01:57:03,340 --> 01:57:03,881
Was it Claudia?

4624
01:57:03,881 --> 01:57:04,481
I didn't know that.

4625
01:57:04,481 --> 01:57:05,021
Cause I go,

4626
01:57:05,021 --> 01:57:06,280
why did you want to die in hell?

4627
01:57:06,281 --> 01:57:07,740
And then someone told me dying,

4628
01:57:07,990 --> 01:57:09,350
dying and he said he was it.

4629
01:57:09,370 --> 01:57:11,110
They said it was dying,

4630
01:57:13,820 --> 01:57:15,970
but that guy was able to
channel my rage real quick.

4631
01:57:16,210 --> 01:57:16,770
You know,

4632
01:57:16,770 --> 01:57:17,603
like that's what it,

4633
01:57:17,680 --> 01:57:18,130
that's a moment.

4634
01:57:18,130 --> 01:57:18,400
You don't,

4635
01:57:18,400 --> 01:57:20,320
you think I find in life that I,

4636
01:57:20,400 --> 01:57:22,000
I think I have something in their control.

4637
01:57:22,001 --> 01:57:23,020
I think I got it going.

4638
01:57:23,050 --> 01:57:24,700
But it sometimes that that one trigger,

4639
01:57:25,240 --> 01:57:25,590
well,

4640
01:57:25,590 --> 01:57:25,840
you know,

4641
01:57:25,840 --> 01:57:30,180
sometimes people can mistake a nice
person for someone who's a God that Nigga

4642
01:57:30,220 --> 01:57:31,053
fuck with too.

4643
01:57:31,150 --> 01:57:31,510
You know?

4644
01:57:31,510 --> 01:57:33,190
And you're always a friendly guy.

4645
01:57:33,310 --> 01:57:34,510
And that happens too,

4646
01:57:34,520 --> 01:57:37,000
especially when people
get drunk and stupid.

4647
01:57:37,330 --> 01:57:38,410
They just make mistakes.

4648
01:57:38,710 --> 01:57:39,370
You know,

4649
01:57:39,370 --> 01:57:42,550
alcohol is a terrible
drug for decision making.

4650
01:57:42,580 --> 01:57:47,580
It's amazing that we make as few shit
decisions as we do because you would

4651
01:57:48,911 --> 01:57:52,930
really realistically look at the Access
to alcohol that the modern adult has.

4652
01:57:53,320 --> 01:57:54,240
And uh,

4653
01:57:54,340 --> 01:57:56,980
how many people have basically
got their shit together?

4654
01:57:57,010 --> 01:57:58,150
It's kind of shocking.

4655
01:57:58,570 --> 01:57:58,811
You know,

4656
01:57:58,811 --> 01:58:01,120
we should all be a fucking
complete and total wreck with it.

4657
01:58:01,121 --> 01:58:05,680
Just a gigantic laundry list of mistakes
that you've made every time we've had a

4658
01:58:05,681 --> 01:58:06,270
few drinks.

4659
01:58:06,270 --> 01:58:06,850
Oh Man.

4660
01:58:06,850 --> 01:58:07,980
Like make my girlfriend,

4661
01:58:08,030 --> 01:58:08,211
uh,

4662
01:58:08,211 --> 01:58:10,350
I got banned from checking on the
cruise and I took her with me.

4663
01:58:12,590 --> 01:58:13,440
I was the worst,

4664
01:58:13,690 --> 01:58:13,860
I think.

4665
01:58:13,860 --> 01:58:15,750
Got a letter saying my
girlfriend couldn't drink.

4666
01:58:15,990 --> 01:58:16,231
Oh,

4667
01:58:16,231 --> 01:58:17,320
that's all sober now.

4668
01:58:17,321 --> 01:58:17,960
I say we,

4669
01:58:17,960 --> 01:58:18,661
that was an issue,

4670
01:58:18,661 --> 01:58:19,580
but she's,

4671
01:58:22,810 --> 01:58:24,080
I like the way he said it was,

4672
01:58:24,310 --> 01:58:25,143
that was an issue.

4673
01:58:25,180 --> 01:58:26,770
But I'm just immediately,

4674
01:58:26,771 --> 01:58:27,021
I just,

4675
01:58:27,021 --> 01:58:30,510
some seeing flashes of people
that I've known and that issue is,

4676
01:58:30,520 --> 01:58:35,320
and what that could be and
all that entails scenes in
movies with girls who are

4677
01:58:35,321 --> 01:58:36,370
really crazy drunk.

4678
01:58:36,371 --> 01:58:38,260
And Adam sitting there shaking his head,

4679
01:58:38,261 --> 01:58:38,411
well,

4680
01:58:38,411 --> 01:58:41,640
fucking beers flying in
the air plates dropping.

4681
01:58:41,750 --> 01:58:42,350
That was the,

4682
01:58:42,350 --> 01:58:46,670
that was the worst man that
would start fights with me.

4683
01:58:46,671 --> 01:58:47,001
She's like,

4684
01:58:47,001 --> 01:58:47,834
I want to take,

4685
01:58:47,900 --> 01:58:48,740
I want to learn Jujitsu.

4686
01:58:48,840 --> 01:58:49,700
What she said you did too,

4687
01:58:49,701 --> 01:58:50,520
and hang on my neck.

4688
01:58:50,520 --> 01:58:50,751
I'm like,

4689
01:58:50,751 --> 01:58:51,500
it's Jujitsu,

4690
01:58:51,500 --> 01:58:51,781
you know,

4691
01:58:51,781 --> 01:58:52,840
like it was once you to fuck her.

4692
01:58:52,870 --> 01:58:55,310
And she does want me to
find just what that was.

4693
01:58:55,670 --> 01:58:55,851
No,

4694
01:58:55,851 --> 01:58:57,090
she would get drunk and uh,

4695
01:58:57,110 --> 01:58:57,310
it,

4696
01:58:57,310 --> 01:58:58,550
it was like she'd be like,

4697
01:58:58,640 --> 01:58:59,390
we were in Canada.

4698
01:58:59,390 --> 01:58:59,760
I'm,

4699
01:58:59,760 --> 01:59:00,591
I'm walking home,

4700
01:59:00,591 --> 01:59:01,040
you know,

4701
01:59:01,040 --> 01:59:01,873
it was kind of,

4702
01:59:02,270 --> 01:59:03,103
you know,

4703
01:59:03,770 --> 01:59:05,240
she tried to walk home from Canada.

4704
01:59:05,300 --> 01:59:05,680
Yeah.

4705
01:59:05,680 --> 01:59:06,351
But she's,

4706
01:59:06,351 --> 01:59:06,891
I love her.

4707
01:59:06,891 --> 01:59:08,310
She's the love of my life and she's,

4708
01:59:08,311 --> 01:59:09,144
she's great.

4709
01:59:09,970 --> 01:59:11,930
She's definitely for this other podcasts.

4710
01:59:11,931 --> 01:59:12,351
I could do that.

4711
01:59:12,351 --> 01:59:13,184
No one on here.

4712
01:59:13,990 --> 01:59:16,280
So it's the same girl
that you're with now?

4713
01:59:16,310 --> 01:59:16,491
Yeah.

4714
01:59:16,491 --> 01:59:17,510
Two years you've been together.

4715
01:59:17,560 --> 01:59:18,140
Um,

4716
01:59:18,140 --> 01:59:18,973
she's half Filipino,

4717
01:59:18,980 --> 01:59:19,813
half Swedish.

4718
01:59:20,090 --> 01:59:20,511
Hey man,

4719
01:59:20,511 --> 01:59:21,171
people get drunk.

4720
01:59:21,171 --> 01:59:21,920
They fuck up.

4721
01:59:21,920 --> 01:59:22,610
Shit happens.

4722
01:59:22,610 --> 01:59:23,600
No alcohol is evil.

4723
01:59:23,630 --> 01:59:25,460
Evil drives for some
people it definitely is.

4724
01:59:25,730 --> 01:59:27,050
Everybody has a different reaction.

4725
01:59:27,051 --> 01:59:30,020
I've seen people drink and they
get a little silly and that's it.

4726
01:59:30,050 --> 01:59:32,990
And I've seen people drink
word to fucking shark eyes.

4727
01:59:33,340 --> 01:59:37,400
There are their pupils go black and
they're gone and they're not there.

4728
01:59:37,401 --> 01:59:39,150
You're looking at them and
they're looking right through you.

4729
01:59:39,180 --> 01:59:39,470
They're like,

4730
01:59:39,470 --> 01:59:40,340
they're in another world.

4731
01:59:40,341 --> 01:59:40,820
They're alerts,

4732
01:59:40,820 --> 01:59:42,830
they're on the Winnie the
Pooh ride at Disneyland,

4733
01:59:42,860 --> 01:59:43,480
fucking live,

4734
01:59:43,480 --> 01:59:44,690
live in their life and bright,

4735
01:59:44,990 --> 01:59:47,210
bright neon colors and floating honeypots.

4736
01:59:47,211 --> 01:59:48,770
They don't know what the fuck is going on.

4737
01:59:49,040 --> 01:59:49,850
I've seen it,

4738
01:59:49,850 --> 01:59:51,530
I've seen it and good friends.

4739
01:59:51,620 --> 01:59:55,760
And I know when I've talked to them
the next day that they don't have any

4740
01:59:55,761 --> 01:59:57,380
recollection whatsoever of the night.

4741
01:59:57,820 --> 01:59:58,151
Yeah.

4742
01:59:58,151 --> 01:59:58,984
I mean,

4743
01:59:59,290 --> 02:00:00,360
I know and I,

4744
02:00:00,361 --> 02:00:02,350
and I didn't know that really
until I started taking,

4745
02:00:02,380 --> 02:00:06,730
I was taking Adderall for while to like
call me down and an Ambien at night to

4746
02:00:06,731 --> 02:00:08,590
sleep and I was starting to have like,

4747
02:00:08,770 --> 02:00:10,270
like they talk about Ambien zombies.

4748
02:00:10,780 --> 02:00:11,420
Wow.

4749
02:00:11,420 --> 02:00:11,721
Glad.

4750
02:00:11,721 --> 02:00:11,971
Listen,

4751
02:00:11,971 --> 02:00:12,661
my glad you're,

4752
02:00:12,661 --> 02:00:13,760
you're willing to talk about that.

4753
02:00:13,761 --> 02:00:14,230
This is a,

4754
02:00:14,230 --> 02:00:15,990
this Adderall problem is a,

4755
02:00:15,991 --> 02:00:16,910
is a big problem.

4756
02:00:17,120 --> 02:00:19,310
I know a gang of people now,

4757
02:00:19,340 --> 02:00:20,173
it's like,

4758
02:00:20,540 --> 02:00:23,750
it was just only like three
a couple of weeks ago,

4759
02:00:23,930 --> 02:00:28,700
but now I know like six or seven people
that have had problems with that shit.

4760
02:00:29,210 --> 02:00:29,840
Yeah.

4761
02:00:29,840 --> 02:00:30,201
Yeah.

4762
02:00:30,201 --> 02:00:34,940
I mean in the descriptions that I've heard
from people like Dunkin's description

4763
02:00:34,941 --> 02:00:36,470
of the way it makes you feel,

4764
02:00:36,500 --> 02:00:38,180
this is horrific.

4765
02:00:38,220 --> 02:00:39,650
Your description is pretty horrific.

4766
02:00:39,690 --> 02:00:39,900
I don't,

4767
02:00:39,900 --> 02:00:40,050
I,

4768
02:00:40,050 --> 02:00:42,860
I just think it reminds me of coke
and I don't really like to cook buzz.

4769
02:00:42,980 --> 02:00:44,540
It just makes me want to do more Adderall.

4770
02:00:44,541 --> 02:00:46,070
Like just like I want to do more coke.

4771
02:00:46,090 --> 02:00:46,281
Yeah.

4772
02:00:46,281 --> 02:00:47,810
It didn't really change that much for me,

4773
02:00:47,811 --> 02:00:48,560
honestly.

4774
02:00:48,560 --> 02:00:49,251
It was like,

4775
02:00:49,251 --> 02:00:52,820
it definitely made me a little more
focused and kept me up a little more,

4776
02:00:53,180 --> 02:00:54,470
but it did just a little more.

4777
02:00:54,740 --> 02:00:55,311
Yeah.

4778
02:00:55,311 --> 02:00:57,290
It wasn't still taking
speed and it's just,

4779
02:00:57,580 --> 02:00:58,640
I know just a little more,

4780
02:00:58,850 --> 02:01:00,020
but I'm telling you how I felt.

4781
02:01:00,690 --> 02:01:05,080
I'm not telling you what you were a good
person for it maybe in like that fits.

4782
02:01:05,300 --> 02:01:05,780
Yeah,

4783
02:01:05,780 --> 02:01:06,290
I sort of think,

4784
02:01:06,290 --> 02:01:06,961
well that's the thing.

4785
02:01:06,961 --> 02:01:07,230
It was like,

4786
02:01:07,230 --> 02:01:07,980
I want,

4787
02:01:07,980 --> 02:01:08,181
when I,

4788
02:01:08,181 --> 02:01:09,680
if I go to a therapist and she said,

4789
02:01:09,681 --> 02:01:10,340
family history,

4790
02:01:10,340 --> 02:01:11,480
oh my mom has schizophrenia.

4791
02:01:11,540 --> 02:01:13,220
Oh my dad is in recovery.

4792
02:01:13,250 --> 02:01:14,150
My sister's in recovery,

4793
02:01:14,151 --> 02:01:14,984
my brothers.

4794
02:01:15,090 --> 02:01:15,591
Then they go,

4795
02:01:15,591 --> 02:01:15,831
okay,

4796
02:01:15,831 --> 02:01:16,490
what do you need?

4797
02:01:16,490 --> 02:01:16,701
You know,

4798
02:01:16,701 --> 02:01:18,650
that's pretty much how they do it with me,

4799
02:01:18,680 --> 02:01:19,161
you know?

4800
02:01:19,161 --> 02:01:19,994
And uh,

4801
02:01:20,060 --> 02:01:21,200
and so then they gave me like,

4802
02:01:21,220 --> 02:01:21,660
you know,

4803
02:01:21,660 --> 02:01:22,170
Alexa,

4804
02:01:22,170 --> 02:01:24,620
because I was at an OCD battle for awhile.

4805
02:01:24,650 --> 02:01:25,700
Like I would just like,

4806
02:01:25,850 --> 02:01:29,330
my mind was just not stopped going and
I would think that I was driving and I

4807
02:01:29,331 --> 02:01:31,280
hit somebody even though I
didn't that circled the block.

4808
02:01:31,281 --> 02:01:31,690
So they're like,

4809
02:01:31,690 --> 02:01:32,360
oh,

4810
02:01:32,360 --> 02:01:34,880
I just had like some high
school was the rough,

4811
02:01:34,970 --> 02:01:36,320
like OCD was rough in high school.

4812
02:01:36,340 --> 02:01:36,760
Go for it.

4813
02:01:36,760 --> 02:01:36,970
Like,

4814
02:01:36,970 --> 02:01:37,141
well,

4815
02:01:37,141 --> 02:01:37,421
what do you,

4816
02:01:37,421 --> 02:01:38,110
what do you think,

4817
02:01:38,110 --> 02:01:39,220
if you had a guess,

4818
02:01:39,240 --> 02:01:40,650
what do you think that's based on?

4819
02:01:40,651 --> 02:01:43,620
Is that something that comes
from stress and environment?

4820
02:01:43,621 --> 02:01:44,240
Is that something

4821
02:01:44,240 --> 02:01:45,310
that comes from me?

4822
02:01:45,311 --> 02:01:46,144
I mean,

4823
02:01:46,510 --> 02:01:48,370
I think it's genetics because like for me,

4824
02:01:48,371 --> 02:01:48,790
I would,

4825
02:01:48,790 --> 02:01:51,940
I went to go see a specialist and he
said in a one to 10 you're about a four.

4826
02:01:52,390 --> 02:01:52,871
And you know,

4827
02:01:52,871 --> 02:01:57,760
you could either go take psychotherapy
or every day you could take a pill and

4828
02:01:57,761 --> 02:01:58,290
then that'll,

4829
02:01:58,290 --> 02:01:58,781
and then I was like,

4830
02:01:58,781 --> 02:01:59,500
I'll take a pill,

4831
02:01:59,500 --> 02:01:59,920
you know,

4832
02:01:59,920 --> 02:02:00,753
because other than,

4833
02:02:00,970 --> 02:02:01,803
so I started

4834
02:02:02,220 --> 02:02:05,220
obsessive compulsive behavior
is based on what it was.

4835
02:02:05,540 --> 02:02:06,900
And then the balance of something,

4836
02:02:07,040 --> 02:02:08,420
lack of Serotonin in your head,

4837
02:02:08,450 --> 02:02:09,740
you know what that means,

4838
02:02:09,770 --> 02:02:10,550
you know?

4839
02:02:10,550 --> 02:02:12,080
So they give you like an Ssri,

4840
02:02:12,081 --> 02:02:12,611
is that what it is?

4841
02:02:12,611 --> 02:02:13,130
Yeah.

4842
02:02:13,130 --> 02:02:13,963
And it was,

4843
02:02:14,300 --> 02:02:14,581
you know,

4844
02:02:14,581 --> 02:02:15,710
if I've been on it for like,

4845
02:02:16,120 --> 02:02:17,120
well I don't know off a little bit,

4846
02:02:17,121 --> 02:02:19,190
but I'd say on for like 10 years,

4847
02:02:19,191 --> 02:02:19,760
12 years.

4848
02:02:19,760 --> 02:02:20,593
Oh Wow.

4849
02:02:21,370 --> 02:02:22,071
These Alexa.

4850
02:02:22,071 --> 02:02:22,731
And it's helped because,

4851
02:02:22,731 --> 02:02:23,481
I mean I literally,

4852
02:02:23,481 --> 02:02:24,314
I would like,

4853
02:02:24,800 --> 02:02:25,311
like whatever,

4854
02:02:25,311 --> 02:02:29,060
like you're not supposed to think about
is like what you think of like for me,

4855
02:02:29,430 --> 02:02:29,730
how,

4856
02:02:29,730 --> 02:02:30,000
how,

4857
02:02:30,000 --> 02:02:30,210
how,

4858
02:02:30,210 --> 02:02:30,490
how,

4859
02:02:30,490 --> 02:02:31,940
how my mind works,

4860
02:02:32,010 --> 02:02:32,690
you know?

4861
02:02:32,690 --> 02:02:35,240
And so I would just
start like thinking that,

4862
02:02:35,270 --> 02:02:36,560
oh my ass is dirty all day.

4863
02:02:36,561 --> 02:02:36,800
Like,

4864
02:02:36,800 --> 02:02:38,270
even though I knew it wasn't fucking ass,

4865
02:02:38,300 --> 02:02:39,490
I would wipe my fucking eye.

4866
02:02:39,500 --> 02:02:41,840
And then all of a sudden
whenever I got stressed,

4867
02:02:41,841 --> 02:02:44,150
like I had a hot chick one time with
their legs fucking spread and like,

4868
02:02:44,270 --> 02:02:44,631
hold on,

4869
02:02:44,631 --> 02:02:45,260
I gotta go,

4870
02:02:45,260 --> 02:02:45,891
I gotta take a shower,

4871
02:02:45,891 --> 02:02:49,550
I got to start fucking having
panic attacks in my head.

4872
02:02:49,690 --> 02:02:50,210
Really.

4873
02:02:50,210 --> 02:02:50,690
And it was,

4874
02:02:50,690 --> 02:02:52,400
it was fucking brutal.

4875
02:02:52,770 --> 02:02:53,300
Brutal.

4876
02:02:53,300 --> 02:02:55,370
And it's based on a lack of Serotonin.

4877
02:02:55,640 --> 02:02:57,170
That's what the therapist said,

4878
02:02:57,171 --> 02:02:58,760
or the psychiatrist or psychologist,

4879
02:02:58,890 --> 02:03:00,960
the human mind is so fucking fascinating.

4880
02:03:00,961 --> 02:03:05,520
You know that levels of this and that
can change things for pro and con.

4881
02:03:05,540 --> 02:03:05,701
It's,

4882
02:03:05,701 --> 02:03:07,170
it's really kind of,

4883
02:03:07,880 --> 02:03:08,290
it's,

4884
02:03:08,290 --> 02:03:13,110
it's so weird because like
that's basically the quality
of your life is based on

4885
02:03:13,190 --> 02:03:13,650
the,

4886
02:03:13,650 --> 02:03:15,390
the your ability to think and move,

4887
02:03:15,420 --> 02:03:15,631
right?

4888
02:03:15,631 --> 02:03:15,991
That's it.

4889
02:03:15,991 --> 02:03:16,480
Those are your,

4890
02:03:16,480 --> 02:03:18,330
that's and your loved ones obviously,

4891
02:03:18,331 --> 02:03:21,690
but the quality of your life is baked
based on some shit that we don't

4892
02:03:21,691 --> 02:03:22,800
completely understand.

4893
02:03:23,220 --> 02:03:24,180
Like how many of us,

4894
02:03:24,770 --> 02:03:25,190
you know,

4895
02:03:25,190 --> 02:03:28,200
are aware of all these different
functions that are going off at any given

4896
02:03:28,201 --> 02:03:31,650
second that allow you to string together
the words to complete a sentence.

4897
02:03:31,890 --> 02:03:36,690
There's all those fucking firing going
on inside your head and we just hope it

4898
02:03:36,691 --> 02:03:37,524
keeps going.

4899
02:03:37,800 --> 02:03:40,020
We just hope it makes
sense and hope it works.

4900
02:03:40,440 --> 02:03:45,440
And I think it's great when there's
stories like yours that sort of override a

4901
02:03:46,381 --> 02:03:47,820
lot of the stories that you hear.

4902
02:03:47,850 --> 02:03:48,900
Like there's a lot of,

4903
02:03:49,800 --> 02:03:52,440
especially recently with
the school shootings,

4904
02:03:52,441 --> 02:03:54,330
it's been a lot of talking about,

4905
02:03:54,331 --> 02:03:54,601
you know,

4906
02:03:54,601 --> 02:03:59,280
ssrs and connecting antidepressants
to school shootings and it's,

4907
02:03:59,290 --> 02:04:00,180
there's a huge number.

4908
02:04:00,181 --> 02:04:00,660
So it's,

4909
02:04:00,660 --> 02:04:02,220
it's nice to hear both,

4910
02:04:02,310 --> 02:04:02,790
uh,

4911
02:04:02,790 --> 02:04:02,980
uh,

4912
02:04:02,980 --> 02:04:03,390
you know,

4913
02:04:03,390 --> 02:04:07,950
both sides of it and hear a positive
story that it took you and bounced to out.

4914
02:04:08,030 --> 02:04:08,271
Yeah,

4915
02:04:08,271 --> 02:04:08,541
it did.

4916
02:04:08,541 --> 02:04:10,490
I mean I definitely didn't like,

4917
02:04:11,090 --> 02:04:14,050
I was always worried like take it during
wrestling season cause I forgot what I

4918
02:04:14,051 --> 02:04:16,510
was going to lose it because my friend
had a similar things are taking,

4919
02:04:16,520 --> 02:04:18,590
it started losing matches
and in my mind that was like,

4920
02:04:18,591 --> 02:04:21,410
well if I take it because what
happens is your mind just never stops.

4921
02:04:21,420 --> 02:04:21,741
So if I,

4922
02:04:21,741 --> 02:04:23,030
if I do this and this is going to happen,

4923
02:04:23,031 --> 02:04:27,980
you know those commercials they have a
for like this person went like this and

4924
02:04:27,981 --> 02:04:31,010
then that person that and it's personal
and then the next thing and now don't be

4925
02:04:31,011 --> 02:04:31,844
a whatever.

4926
02:04:32,420 --> 02:04:34,400
You don't talking about the insurance,

4927
02:04:34,590 --> 02:04:36,380
I forgot the name of the brand,

4928
02:04:36,381 --> 02:04:36,710
whatever.

4929
02:04:36,710 --> 02:04:40,960
So kind of what happens here like
oh if I don't get a boner right now,

4930
02:04:40,961 --> 02:04:41,920
then I'm gay and I'm gay.

4931
02:04:41,921 --> 02:04:44,410
I'll come on to quite
loud the back of a closet,

4932
02:04:44,411 --> 02:04:45,780
my dad's going to be disappointed and the,

4933
02:04:45,781 --> 02:04:47,630
and then my kids just know on time.

4934
02:04:47,760 --> 02:04:50,370
What is the current thinking
on this kind of behavior?

4935
02:04:50,371 --> 02:04:51,660
Is it nature or nurture?

4936
02:04:51,720 --> 02:04:56,370
Because I know that they connect a lot
of the way a child becomes an adult,

4937
02:04:56,371 --> 02:05:00,530
a lot of weird shit that they
have to lack of attention,

4938
02:05:00,540 --> 02:05:01,710
love and certain things.

4939
02:05:01,711 --> 02:05:04,200
Lack of focus when kids are really young.

4940
02:05:04,620 --> 02:05:09,120
I wonder what it is that makes someone
develop like an aberration and the train

4941
02:05:09,121 --> 02:05:09,661
of thought,

4942
02:05:09,661 --> 02:05:14,100
like a weird thing that they can't
control and whether it is growing up in a

4943
02:05:14,101 --> 02:05:16,920
life full of uncertainty when
you need certainty the most.

4944
02:05:16,950 --> 02:05:17,161
I mean,

4945
02:05:17,161 --> 02:05:17,994
in order to,

4946
02:05:18,450 --> 02:05:19,283
you know,

4947
02:05:19,410 --> 02:05:20,011
when you,

4948
02:05:20,011 --> 02:05:20,801
when you were a child,

4949
02:05:20,801 --> 02:05:22,380
do you want to think that
everything's going to be fine?

4950
02:05:22,381 --> 02:05:23,730
But when you're a child and you realize,

4951
02:05:23,731 --> 02:05:23,910
well,

4952
02:05:23,910 --> 02:05:25,290
there's absolutely no way,

4953
02:05:25,291 --> 02:05:26,040
everything's fine,

4954
02:05:26,040 --> 02:05:29,790
everything is fucking a crazy mess
and this is life from here on out.

4955
02:05:29,791 --> 02:05:31,230
And that's how your mind develops.

4956
02:05:31,390 --> 02:05:31,571
Oh,

4957
02:05:31,571 --> 02:05:32,680
like before mastery matches,

4958
02:05:32,681 --> 02:05:33,730
like when I was the most nervous,

4959
02:05:33,731 --> 02:05:36,340
I would call up my dean of
my high school and be like,

4960
02:05:36,370 --> 02:05:36,551
ah,

4961
02:05:36,551 --> 02:05:38,020
I took two desserts last year.

4962
02:05:38,320 --> 02:05:39,153
Uh,

4963
02:05:39,430 --> 02:05:39,960
I,

4964
02:05:39,960 --> 02:05:40,960
I'm not even kidding.

4965
02:05:40,961 --> 02:05:41,560
I would do this.

4966
02:05:41,560 --> 02:05:42,580
And then he'd be like,

4967
02:05:42,581 --> 02:05:42,791
okay,

4968
02:05:42,791 --> 02:05:43,541
just go win the match.

4969
02:05:43,541 --> 02:05:44,231
And I go pin the kit.

4970
02:05:44,231 --> 02:05:46,330
It was like fucking insane.

4971
02:05:46,390 --> 02:05:47,410
And you just,

4972
02:05:47,411 --> 02:05:48,610
you needed acceptance.

4973
02:05:48,720 --> 02:05:49,281
Yeah.

4974
02:05:49,281 --> 02:05:50,170
I mean a lot of that is,

4975
02:05:50,171 --> 02:05:51,160
and then it's also,

4976
02:05:51,190 --> 02:05:52,110
but I think also it's,

4977
02:05:52,810 --> 02:05:54,370
I think if you could channel energies,

4978
02:05:54,371 --> 02:05:55,204
like there was a,

4979
02:05:55,240 --> 02:05:58,960
I coached wrestling and there's so many
kids out there that like if they would

4980
02:05:58,961 --> 02:06:03,460
just put the fucking effort like that
they put in a world of Warcraft or

4981
02:06:03,461 --> 02:06:06,310
whatever and to something else.

4982
02:06:06,370 --> 02:06:08,200
And I'm not saying anything's
wrong with world of Warcraft,

4983
02:06:08,201 --> 02:06:09,034
but you know,

4984
02:06:09,160 --> 02:06:11,050
then they would be so
much more productive.

4985
02:06:12,370 --> 02:06:13,330
And that's what,

4986
02:06:13,360 --> 02:06:14,170
you know,

4987
02:06:14,170 --> 02:06:15,010
my high school,

4988
02:06:15,011 --> 02:06:19,690
the hide was about taking kids who are
extremely negative shit going on and

4989
02:06:20,050 --> 02:06:21,760
taking that and channeling and deposit it.

4990
02:06:21,790 --> 02:06:22,900
Like you had to play a sport,

4991
02:06:23,200 --> 02:06:24,430
you had to uh,

4992
02:06:24,730 --> 02:06:25,001
you know,

4993
02:06:25,001 --> 02:06:28,750
talk about your feelings every
week for like a couple hours a day.

4994
02:06:28,751 --> 02:06:29,970
Like you have to go to seminars.

4995
02:06:30,010 --> 02:06:30,150
I,

4996
02:06:30,150 --> 02:06:31,930
I was there with like
talking about your feelings,

4997
02:06:32,260 --> 02:06:35,710
it talk about your issues and I was there
with like Jim Belushi sign and shares

4998
02:06:35,711 --> 02:06:38,740
kid was there and like all
these like it's funny story.

4999
02:06:38,741 --> 02:06:42,070
I actually went to go visit my sister
at the seminar one time and I was,

5000
02:06:42,610 --> 02:06:46,460
I was running away from the house and
being a bad kid and then the assistant,

5001
02:06:46,461 --> 02:06:46,561
they,

5002
02:06:46,561 --> 02:06:47,560
oh they had these seminars,

5003
02:06:47,561 --> 02:06:47,681
it,

5004
02:06:47,681 --> 02:06:50,200
everyone talks about their
problems and they said okay.

5005
02:06:50,230 --> 02:06:51,063
Lisa was like,

5006
02:06:51,190 --> 02:06:53,170
and my sister and my dad were
like come to the seminar.

5007
02:06:53,290 --> 02:06:55,090
So I like went and I'm like,

5008
02:06:55,091 --> 02:06:55,301
okay,

5009
02:06:55,301 --> 02:06:56,800
don't talk to me about anything.

5010
02:06:57,160 --> 02:06:58,010
I'm like a punk kid.

5011
02:06:58,011 --> 02:06:58,960
I don't talk anything bad.

5012
02:06:59,620 --> 02:07:00,490
So right away my sister,

5013
02:07:00,491 --> 02:07:01,870
it's her turn to speak Adam,

5014
02:07:01,930 --> 02:07:03,310
you don't do what the loss of your mother,

5015
02:07:03,370 --> 02:07:04,300
you don't deal with anything.

5016
02:07:04,340 --> 02:07:07,330
You and I start crying
and I'm like 12 fuck you.

5017
02:07:07,480 --> 02:07:10,360
And I walk out and I waited in
the car for like forties I'm like,

5018
02:07:10,361 --> 02:07:13,150
I'm not going back to those fucking
seminars at this boarding school in Maine.

5019
02:07:13,600 --> 02:07:16,960
So then I'm walking down this hill and
my dad is sitting with chair because

5020
02:07:16,961 --> 02:07:17,221
share,

5021
02:07:17,221 --> 02:07:18,070
his son went there,

5022
02:07:18,280 --> 02:07:19,240
share and Greg Allman,

5023
02:07:19,540 --> 02:07:20,373
the Allman brothers,

5024
02:07:20,450 --> 02:07:20,720
and,

5025
02:07:20,720 --> 02:07:21,371
and then she has like,

5026
02:07:21,371 --> 02:07:21,940
Hey,

5027
02:07:21,940 --> 02:07:22,361
my dad's like,

5028
02:07:22,361 --> 02:07:22,481

5029
02:07:22,481 --> 02:07:23,050
share my,

5030
02:07:23,050 --> 02:07:24,370
my kid's having a really rough time.

5031
02:07:24,690 --> 02:07:25,900
You'd say hello to one or something.

5032
02:07:26,080 --> 02:07:27,520
So I'm walking a 12 years old,

5033
02:07:27,550 --> 02:07:29,530
84 pounds and then share it goes,

5034
02:07:29,780 --> 02:07:30,070
uh,

5035
02:07:30,070 --> 02:07:30,611
Hey Adam.

5036
02:07:30,611 --> 02:07:31,030
I go,

5037
02:07:31,030 --> 02:07:31,181
hey,

5038
02:07:31,181 --> 02:07:32,030
share and keep walking.

5039
02:07:32,110 --> 02:07:34,540
I didn't even fucking acknowledge her.

5040
02:07:34,570 --> 02:07:35,131
It was like it.

5041
02:07:35,131 --> 02:07:35,591
Hey share.

5042
02:07:35,591 --> 02:07:35,661
It.

5043
02:07:35,661 --> 02:07:36,530
Just kept fucking walking.

5044
02:07:36,960 --> 02:07:37,580
Wow.

5045
02:07:37,580 --> 02:07:37,891
It's like,

5046
02:07:37,891 --> 02:07:38,724
fuck this.

5047
02:07:39,450 --> 02:07:39,780
Yeah.

5048
02:07:39,780 --> 02:07:43,500
Sharon kids with Greg home and I forgot
about that cause I thought like you went

5049
02:07:43,501 --> 02:07:45,770
to school with chastity Bono Jazz.

5050
02:07:45,770 --> 02:07:46,370
Yeah,

5051
02:07:46,370 --> 02:07:46,651
no.

5052
02:07:46,651 --> 02:07:47,091
And I went to,

5053
02:07:47,091 --> 02:07:49,130
I went with that Elijah a lie to Ahmond.

5054
02:07:49,220 --> 02:07:50,450
What is that kid life?

5055
02:07:51,050 --> 02:07:51,890
He was a cool kid.

5056
02:07:51,891 --> 02:07:52,281
He was like,

5057
02:07:52,281 --> 02:07:53,000
uh,

5058
02:07:53,000 --> 02:07:53,780
you know,

5059
02:07:53,780 --> 02:07:55,070
he was a really good guy and musician.

5060
02:07:55,071 --> 02:07:57,820
He was on tour with like
nine inch nails there.

5061
02:07:57,850 --> 02:07:59,960
I was genes that when he
was like 16 or something.

5062
02:08:00,090 --> 02:08:02,130
And the kids of celebrities like that.

5063
02:08:02,131 --> 02:08:04,650
Like your dad's Gregg Allman
and your mother share.

5064
02:08:04,890 --> 02:08:05,723
Good luck.

5065
02:08:06,970 --> 02:08:07,330
Yeah.

5066
02:08:07,330 --> 02:08:08,620
That's a fucking tough ride,

5067
02:08:08,621 --> 02:08:09,454
man.

5068
02:08:09,520 --> 02:08:09,790
I would,

5069
02:08:09,790 --> 02:08:10,001
yeah,

5070
02:08:10,001 --> 02:08:10,380
that's,

5071
02:08:10,380 --> 02:08:11,430
and that's what the thing is that,

5072
02:08:11,440 --> 02:08:12,040
that's,

5073
02:08:12,040 --> 02:08:13,300
that's the beauty of being a kid.

5074
02:08:13,301 --> 02:08:14,920
But the hard part about
being a parent is like,

5075
02:08:15,250 --> 02:08:16,600
no matter how successful you are,

5076
02:08:16,601 --> 02:08:18,310
like if you don't give a shit about them,

5077
02:08:18,311 --> 02:08:19,570
like you don't give a shit about you

5078
02:08:20,260 --> 02:08:21,520
that it'll come out.

5079
02:08:21,790 --> 02:08:24,310
It'll be pretty evident
in the way they're raised.

5080
02:08:24,730 --> 02:08:25,130
You're going to,

5081
02:08:25,130 --> 02:08:25,710
they're going to be,

5082
02:08:25,710 --> 02:08:29,120
you're going to be able to see how
much time this person took in spent.

5083
02:08:29,880 --> 02:08:30,471
It was a bad parent.

5084
02:08:30,471 --> 02:08:31,301
But I'm saying in general,

5085
02:08:31,301 --> 02:08:34,090
a lot of people are bad parents because
nobody told them how to do it right

5086
02:08:34,120 --> 02:08:34,360
then.

5087
02:08:34,360 --> 02:08:37,840
No one did it right to fam and they don't
know how to do it right and they fuck

5088
02:08:37,841 --> 02:08:39,340
up and they're a mess themselves.

5089
02:08:39,341 --> 02:08:40,930
And they try to get it
together for their kids,

5090
02:08:40,931 --> 02:08:41,764
but their week,

5091
02:08:42,130 --> 02:08:42,600
you know,

5092
02:08:42,600 --> 02:08:43,690
like most of us are,

5093
02:08:43,691 --> 02:08:44,200
you know,

5094
02:08:44,200 --> 02:08:45,010
most,

5095
02:08:45,010 --> 02:08:45,970
most people,

5096
02:08:45,971 --> 02:08:46,330
uh,

5097
02:08:46,330 --> 02:08:47,163
don't have a good,

5098
02:08:47,200 --> 02:08:48,490
they don't have a good blueprint.

5099
02:08:48,850 --> 02:08:51,640
They don't have a good
directions manual for this life.

5100
02:08:51,670 --> 02:08:55,480
They're just fucking making mistakes and
apologizing and trying to pay as much

5101
02:08:55,481 --> 02:08:56,680
attention to what everybody else's

5102
02:08:56,750 --> 02:08:57,650
do you want from coaching.

5103
02:08:57,730 --> 02:08:58,250
Now,

5104
02:08:58,250 --> 02:08:58,671
coaching,

5105
02:08:58,671 --> 02:08:59,091
wrestling,

5106
02:08:59,091 --> 02:08:59,661
you see the kids,

5107
02:08:59,661 --> 02:09:02,570
the parents come to the matches and
carrots come to practice and parents that

5108
02:09:02,571 --> 02:09:05,210
don't and that how the kid is such a,

5109
02:09:06,110 --> 02:09:06,943
you know,

5110
02:09:07,060 --> 02:09:08,480
it's an easy example.

5111
02:09:08,800 --> 02:09:09,460
Yeah.

5112
02:09:09,460 --> 02:09:13,680
So it's real unfortunate when you see
kids that are growing up with parents that

5113
02:09:13,681 --> 02:09:14,770
don't give a fuck about them.

5114
02:09:14,860 --> 02:09:15,161
You know,

5115
02:09:15,161 --> 02:09:16,810
and you'd go to a park and like,

5116
02:09:16,840 --> 02:09:18,820
there'll be like one kid when you're like,

5117
02:09:18,821 --> 02:09:19,600
where is your,

5118
02:09:19,600 --> 02:09:20,620
who's watching you man?

5119
02:09:21,150 --> 02:09:23,620
Cause like four years old and he's
just like free at the park park.

5120
02:09:23,650 --> 02:09:26,050
That's the hard part about these
comedy shows on the cruises,

5121
02:09:26,060 --> 02:09:29,240
like clean shows for little kids and kids.

5122
02:09:29,241 --> 02:09:29,931
Sometimes kids like,

5123
02:09:29,931 --> 02:09:30,681
you're not funny,

5124
02:09:30,681 --> 02:09:30,870
you know,

5125
02:09:30,870 --> 02:09:33,620
like a five year old heckles you
and I can't say anything back.

5126
02:09:33,650 --> 02:09:34,640
I don't want to lose my job.

5127
02:09:34,670 --> 02:09:35,503
You know,

5128
02:09:36,280 --> 02:09:36,891
I got my thing,

5129
02:09:36,891 --> 02:09:37,371
I looked at the kid,

5130
02:09:37,371 --> 02:09:37,521
I go,

5131
02:09:37,521 --> 02:09:38,030
look at me,

5132
02:09:38,030 --> 02:09:38,900
I am your future.

5133
02:09:39,260 --> 02:09:41,060
And then the kid just
like dead in his tracks,

5134
02:09:41,061 --> 02:09:41,300
like,

5135
02:09:41,300 --> 02:09:41,990
ah,

5136
02:09:41,990 --> 02:09:42,950
he doesn't know what to say.

5137
02:09:43,340 --> 02:09:44,750
I completely confused.

5138
02:09:45,080 --> 02:09:46,690
You have to deal with
five-year-old haircuts.

5139
02:09:46,730 --> 02:09:47,450
That's hilarious.

5140
02:09:47,450 --> 02:09:48,220
But the fibroids,

5141
02:09:48,220 --> 02:09:50,000
it's when the parent heckles that's,

5142
02:09:50,060 --> 02:09:50,720
I'm like,

5143
02:09:50,720 --> 02:09:50,961
really?

5144
02:09:50,961 --> 02:09:53,890
You're going to have to be on
a kid with the kid right there.

5145
02:09:53,910 --> 02:09:54,160
Yeah.

5146
02:09:54,160 --> 02:09:55,430
They had that parent heckles like,

5147
02:09:55,580 --> 02:09:55,761
oh,

5148
02:09:55,761 --> 02:09:57,320
when's the calling me
coming on or something.

5149
02:09:57,321 --> 02:09:57,680
And I'm like,

5150
02:09:57,680 --> 02:09:59,540
oh my goodness.

5151
02:09:59,570 --> 02:09:59,990
And I'm like,

5152
02:09:59,990 --> 02:10:00,380
dude,

5153
02:10:00,380 --> 02:10:00,891
I always say,

5154
02:10:00,891 --> 02:10:01,191
listen,

5155
02:10:01,191 --> 02:10:04,460
come back at 11 o'clock at the adult
show and we could have this discussion.

5156
02:10:04,490 --> 02:10:04,881
You know,

5157
02:10:04,881 --> 02:10:05,690
it's just right.

5158
02:10:05,690 --> 02:10:07,190
But then you turn it into the dark,

5159
02:10:07,210 --> 02:10:08,120
the bitter coffee.

5160
02:10:08,140 --> 02:10:09,370
It's like such a fine line,

5161
02:10:09,490 --> 02:10:10,323
you know?

5162
02:10:10,340 --> 02:10:10,701
Well,

5163
02:10:10,701 --> 02:10:11,061
you know,

5164
02:10:11,061 --> 02:10:12,380
people think they're on vacation.

5165
02:10:12,381 --> 02:10:13,490
They should be entertained.

5166
02:10:13,491 --> 02:10:15,600
And if they don't think you're
funny and why aren't even like them.

5167
02:10:15,680 --> 02:10:16,280
So I'm just curious.

5168
02:10:16,280 --> 02:10:17,150
Speak my mind.

5169
02:10:17,390 --> 02:10:17,850
All right.

5170
02:10:17,850 --> 02:10:19,580
Pay me

5171
02:10:21,210 --> 02:10:23,270
$100 would be locked in
a closet every night.

5172
02:10:23,570 --> 02:10:24,403
But now it's like,

5173
02:10:24,610 --> 02:10:25,443
like the,

5174
02:10:25,730 --> 02:10:27,290
the cruise that I worked for,

5175
02:10:27,291 --> 02:10:29,080
its young and it's just
people fucking like,

5176
02:10:29,180 --> 02:10:29,720
whoa.

5177
02:10:29,720 --> 02:10:30,320
Like it's,

5178
02:10:30,320 --> 02:10:30,560
I mean,

5179
02:10:30,560 --> 02:10:31,280
not like,

5180
02:10:31,280 --> 02:10:32,050
I mean that's it.

5181
02:10:32,050 --> 02:10:32,870
The whole cruise.

5182
02:10:32,870 --> 02:10:34,860
I you just see a lot of single people.

5183
02:10:34,870 --> 02:10:35,080
Okay.

5184
02:10:35,080 --> 02:10:35,490
Music,

5185
02:10:35,490 --> 02:10:35,850
Dat,

5186
02:10:35,850 --> 02:10:36,221
Dat,

5187
02:10:36,221 --> 02:10:37,940
dat like hip hop.

5188
02:10:38,360 --> 02:10:40,370
You see like the hip hop club at night.

5189
02:10:40,371 --> 02:10:40,970
I mean,

5190
02:10:40,970 --> 02:10:42,260
you might as well be having sex.

5191
02:10:42,770 --> 02:10:44,480
The dancing that goes on is like,

5192
02:10:44,690 --> 02:10:46,370
I mean the guy has a fucking hard on,

5193
02:10:46,400 --> 02:10:48,320
the girl has her ass cheeks to him.

5194
02:10:48,560 --> 02:10:52,910
She's just bending over and he's just
rubbing his fucking boner in her ass and

5195
02:10:52,911 --> 02:10:53,600
everyone's like,

5196
02:10:53,600 --> 02:10:54,710
and this is going on everywhere.

5197
02:10:54,760 --> 02:10:54,971
When I,

5198
02:10:54,971 --> 02:10:56,160
how many dudes come doing that?

5199
02:10:56,690 --> 02:10:57,523
Just dance.

5200
02:10:57,800 --> 02:10:58,633
Just rubbing.

5201
02:10:58,800 --> 02:11:00,300
Like this is good.

5202
02:11:00,310 --> 02:11:01,143
This is awesome.

5203
02:11:01,160 --> 02:11:01,993
I mean it's,

5204
02:11:02,300 --> 02:11:02,601
you know,

5205
02:11:02,601 --> 02:11:02,751
they,

5206
02:11:02,751 --> 02:11:06,170
I mean is that cheating
if you come while dancing?

5207
02:11:07,160 --> 02:11:07,993
I don't think it is.

5208
02:11:08,050 --> 02:11:10,690
It's a culturally accepted six dance,

5209
02:11:10,700 --> 02:11:12,650
a dance move somewhere along the line.

5210
02:11:12,651 --> 02:11:13,550
That became the thing,

5211
02:11:13,551 --> 02:11:14,390
the way that people dance.

5212
02:11:14,391 --> 02:11:15,830
So they rubbed her ass against your took.

5213
02:11:16,220 --> 02:11:17,390
There wasn't like normal.

5214
02:11:17,450 --> 02:11:18,500
That was like pretty rare,

5215
02:11:19,040 --> 02:11:20,720
just a few years back.

5216
02:11:21,110 --> 02:11:23,900
But now it's like fairly
normal when people in clubs.

5217
02:11:24,050 --> 02:11:24,441
A lot of fun.

5218
02:11:24,441 --> 02:11:24,750
By the way,

5219
02:11:24,750 --> 02:11:25,390
his podcast.

5220
02:11:25,390 --> 02:11:26,290
Thanks for having me on man.

5221
02:11:26,680 --> 02:11:27,160
I was,

5222
02:11:27,160 --> 02:11:27,621
I was actually,

5223
02:11:27,621 --> 02:11:28,760
I was more nervous about this,

5224
02:11:28,761 --> 02:11:29,594
that I was Jay Leno.

5225
02:11:29,720 --> 02:11:30,260
Why?

5226
02:11:30,260 --> 02:11:31,190
Why would you be nervous about it?

5227
02:11:31,250 --> 02:11:31,730
I don't,

5228
02:11:31,730 --> 02:11:32,870
well I don't know.

5229
02:11:32,900 --> 02:11:35,750
I was wondering about this in anything
because because you are like an Alpha

5230
02:11:35,751 --> 02:11:36,350
male.

5231
02:11:36,350 --> 02:11:36,821
I mean,

5232
02:11:36,821 --> 02:11:37,940
and it's not in a bad way,

5233
02:11:37,941 --> 02:11:39,100
but you're Joe Rogan and you got your,

5234
02:11:39,101 --> 02:11:40,670
like you have this thing
and then it's like,

5235
02:11:41,300 --> 02:11:41,531
I,

5236
02:11:41,531 --> 02:11:43,040
I never wanted to ask you for anything.

5237
02:11:43,100 --> 02:11:43,281
Like,

5238
02:11:43,281 --> 02:11:43,731
everyone's like,

5239
02:11:43,731 --> 02:11:44,750
why don't you have row go on?

5240
02:11:44,751 --> 02:11:45,021
And I'm like,

5241
02:11:45,021 --> 02:11:46,430
I don't want to ask him for anything.

5242
02:11:46,580 --> 02:11:47,031
You know,

5243
02:11:47,031 --> 02:11:48,290
I don't want to be that guy who,

5244
02:11:48,700 --> 02:11:49,850
cause I don't want to do that,

5245
02:11:49,851 --> 02:11:50,330
you know?

5246
02:11:50,330 --> 02:11:51,440
And I was just sorta like when I,

5247
02:11:51,460 --> 02:11:52,910
when I met you a couple
of times and I was like,

5248
02:11:53,300 --> 02:11:55,910
I felt like I was that nerdy
fanboy kid that was like,

5249
02:11:56,000 --> 02:11:56,181
Oh,

5250
02:11:56,181 --> 02:11:56,910
who's gonna win this one?

5251
02:11:56,910 --> 02:11:57,743
Who's the one note?

5252
02:11:58,250 --> 02:12:00,560
And then you looked like you
couldn't wait to get away from me.

5253
02:12:00,590 --> 02:12:00,971
No,

5254
02:12:00,971 --> 02:12:01,221
no,

5255
02:12:01,221 --> 02:12:01,460
no.

5256
02:12:01,460 --> 02:12:02,660
You didn't seem like that at all,

5257
02:12:02,661 --> 02:12:02,990
man.

5258
02:12:02,990 --> 02:12:04,550
I felt like I was just
annoying on your head.

5259
02:12:04,610 --> 02:12:06,280
It's an annoying kid
that bothered you and I,

5260
02:12:06,281 --> 02:12:08,060
and I wouldn't step and if I was you,

5261
02:12:08,061 --> 02:12:09,590
I would feel the exact same way about me.

5262
02:12:09,591 --> 02:12:09,951
I was like,

5263
02:12:09,951 --> 02:12:11,030
who is this annoying kid?

5264
02:12:11,380 --> 02:12:12,690
It's asking me these questions.

5265
02:12:12,710 --> 02:12:13,910
This is all on your own headband.

5266
02:12:13,970 --> 02:12:15,050
There was none of that going on.

5267
02:12:15,051 --> 02:12:16,390
Just start your another funny comments.

5268
02:12:16,790 --> 02:12:18,500
I get real simple.

5269
02:12:19,220 --> 02:12:21,950
And then I actually like
did Dmu once I said,

5270
02:12:21,951 --> 02:12:22,460
hey man,

5271
02:12:22,460 --> 02:12:23,570
we need this and you didn't respond.

5272
02:12:23,571 --> 02:12:23,811
I'm like,

5273
02:12:23,811 --> 02:12:24,081
great.

5274
02:12:24,081 --> 02:12:24,861
I fucking blew it.

5275
02:12:24,861 --> 02:12:25,071
Like,

5276
02:12:25,071 --> 02:12:25,904
and he's not going to,

5277
02:12:25,920 --> 02:12:26,490
this is,

5278
02:12:26,490 --> 02:12:27,620
I don't even look at those things.

5279
02:12:27,621 --> 02:12:28,281
For the most part,

5280
02:12:28,281 --> 02:12:28,521
they're good.

5281
02:12:28,521 --> 02:12:29,354
Too many of them.

5282
02:12:29,790 --> 02:12:30,623
CD goes out.

5283
02:12:31,890 --> 02:12:34,880
I'm going to all these negative comments
and then everyone's going to say,

5284
02:12:34,881 --> 02:12:35,450
you suck.

5285
02:12:35,450 --> 02:12:36,950
And then Dana White's going to be like,

5286
02:12:36,951 --> 02:12:37,430
you're never working.

5287
02:12:37,430 --> 02:12:38,480
And then it to me,

5288
02:12:38,700 --> 02:12:39,231
next thing I know,

5289
02:12:39,231 --> 02:12:40,880
I'm like all that stuff.

5290
02:12:41,660 --> 02:12:42,170
No,

5291
02:12:42,170 --> 02:12:45,230
it doesn't stop if I don't get sleep
at the sleep thing is like big.

5292
02:12:45,330 --> 02:12:46,820
And I had stopped taking ambien.

5293
02:12:46,821 --> 02:12:49,510
That was the point because I
was getting with the Ambien,

5294
02:12:49,940 --> 02:12:52,940
I was taking the Ambien to go to sleep
on the cruises because you lose the three

5295
02:12:52,941 --> 02:12:54,560
hours when you fly and
then you're on a boat.

5296
02:12:54,561 --> 02:12:58,010
And Paula and I couldn't sleep at night
because it shows her at 1230 at night.

5297
02:12:58,040 --> 02:12:59,300
And then I'm up when I'm up,

5298
02:12:59,360 --> 02:12:59,710
you know,

5299
02:12:59,710 --> 02:13:00,081
comedies,

5300
02:13:00,081 --> 02:13:01,400
adrenaline like when you're up,

5301
02:13:01,730 --> 02:13:05,890
I'm not going to bed an hour after my
five year olds are talking shit too far it

5302
02:13:05,920 --> 02:13:06,310
up.

5303
02:13:06,310 --> 02:13:06,500
Yeah,

5304
02:13:06,500 --> 02:13:07,333
exactly.

5305
02:13:07,550 --> 02:13:08,110
So then,

5306
02:13:08,110 --> 02:13:08,690
uh,

5307
02:13:08,690 --> 02:13:09,530
I started taking ambien.

5308
02:13:09,531 --> 02:13:10,010
My Dad,

5309
02:13:10,010 --> 02:13:11,150
my dad changed your last name,

5310
02:13:11,151 --> 02:13:11,590
bad,

5311
02:13:11,590 --> 02:13:11,931
says,

5312
02:13:11,931 --> 02:13:12,381
hey man,

5313
02:13:12,381 --> 02:13:12,950
take uh,

5314
02:13:12,950 --> 02:13:13,710
take some ambient.

5315
02:13:13,710 --> 02:13:15,190
You'll knock out in a second.

5316
02:13:15,191 --> 02:13:16,220
It's like awesome advice.

5317
02:13:17,000 --> 02:13:17,200
No,

5318
02:13:17,200 --> 02:13:20,000
just Melatonin that manage
Alice Cooper in the 60s.

5319
02:13:20,001 --> 02:13:20,834
That's the whole thing.

5320
02:13:21,260 --> 02:13:22,040
Just jerking off.

5321
02:13:22,040 --> 02:13:23,240
He has a great Frank Zappa bailing.

5322
02:13:23,241 --> 02:13:24,560
I'm gonna Start with the jail story.

5323
02:13:24,890 --> 02:13:25,760
Tell you about that in second.

5324
02:13:25,820 --> 02:13:26,860
So my dad,

5325
02:13:26,861 --> 02:13:27,500
uh,

5326
02:13:27,500 --> 02:13:27,741
says,

5327
02:13:27,741 --> 02:13:27,861
Hey,

5328
02:13:27,861 --> 02:13:28,900
take this ambiance,

5329
02:13:28,930 --> 02:13:33,040
I start taking the Ambien and then
next thing I know the next day my whole

5330
02:13:33,041 --> 02:13:33,681
Twitter there was,

5331
02:13:33,681 --> 02:13:34,870
was filled with shit that I wrote.

5332
02:13:35,140 --> 02:13:36,040
I don't remember writing.

5333
02:13:36,580 --> 02:13:41,200
And I started like they said like you
can get into like Ambien zombies state

5334
02:13:41,310 --> 02:13:41,730
the,

5335
02:13:41,730 --> 02:13:42,740
I didn't think that was true.

5336
02:13:42,800 --> 02:13:43,690
These people were just bullshitting.

5337
02:13:43,890 --> 02:13:45,000
I have a whole bit about it.

5338
02:13:45,030 --> 02:13:48,630
But being in a hotel in San Francisco
when it was on fire and all these people

5339
02:13:48,631 --> 02:13:49,740
were waking up on Ambien,

5340
02:13:49,741 --> 02:13:50,574
it was so obvious

5341
02:13:50,580 --> 02:13:51,640
and do and I was like,

5342
02:13:51,641 --> 02:13:54,400
literally I had sex with my
girlfriend one night did.

5343
02:13:54,920 --> 02:13:55,331
I was like,

5344
02:13:55,331 --> 02:13:55,570
Hey,

5345
02:13:55,570 --> 02:13:56,620
what time do you come home last night?

5346
02:13:56,621 --> 02:13:57,401
It's like we fucked.

5347
02:13:57,401 --> 02:13:58,060
And I was like,

5348
02:13:58,060 --> 02:13:58,601
Oh shit.

5349
02:13:58,601 --> 02:13:59,230
Like we did fuck.

5350
02:13:59,230 --> 02:14:01,510
And then like little memories
of us walking and she's like,

5351
02:14:01,511 --> 02:14:01,661
yeah,

5352
02:14:01,661 --> 02:14:02,494
you were great.

5353
02:14:02,730 --> 02:14:03,610
I was like,

5354
02:14:03,820 --> 02:14:08,000
the best I've ever been was on
fucking Ambien as a Zombie of a pill.

5355
02:14:08,030 --> 02:14:09,400
That's scary on a boat.

5356
02:14:09,401 --> 02:14:11,200
You could have just walked
off the side of the boat,

5357
02:14:11,680 --> 02:14:12,390
Zombie thing,

5358
02:14:12,390 --> 02:14:12,750
dude.

5359
02:14:12,750 --> 02:14:13,361
And I was like,

5360
02:14:13,361 --> 02:14:14,081
I told my girlfriend,

5361
02:14:14,081 --> 02:14:14,290
I'm like,

5362
02:14:14,290 --> 02:14:15,011
hide my keys.

5363
02:14:15,011 --> 02:14:15,821
If I take ambiance,

5364
02:14:15,821 --> 02:14:16,654
I don't drive.

5365
02:14:16,750 --> 02:14:18,040
But when you got to say hide your keys,

5366
02:14:18,041 --> 02:14:18,641
you don't drive.

5367
02:14:18,641 --> 02:14:20,020
Maybe you shouldn't be taking a shit.

5368
02:14:20,050 --> 02:14:22,090
You know what kind of
tweets to Jules send out?

5369
02:14:22,630 --> 02:14:23,740
I was being super nice.

5370
02:14:23,741 --> 02:14:24,670
All of a sudden I was like,

5371
02:14:24,790 --> 02:14:25,610
hey Tim Duffy,

5372
02:14:25,610 --> 02:14:26,081
pick fan.

5373
02:14:26,081 --> 02:14:26,620
When's your next fight?

5374
02:14:26,620 --> 02:14:27,450
And you responded.

5375
02:14:27,450 --> 02:14:28,283
I was like,

5376
02:14:28,680 --> 02:14:29,513
Todd Duffy.

5377
02:14:30,440 --> 02:14:31,273
I was like so big.

5378
02:14:31,330 --> 02:14:32,170
I know your first name.

5379
02:14:32,171 --> 02:14:35,560
All these MMA people like
I was like answering all my
people that tweet me like,

5380
02:14:35,561 --> 02:14:35,801
Hey,

5381
02:14:35,801 --> 02:14:36,310
thank you.

5382
02:14:36,310 --> 02:14:36,671
And now,

5383
02:14:36,671 --> 02:14:38,050
but then it was misspelled words.

5384
02:14:38,051 --> 02:14:39,250
It was like choppy,

5385
02:14:40,600 --> 02:14:41,433
choppy sentences.

5386
02:14:41,980 --> 02:14:42,230
The front.

5387
02:14:42,230 --> 02:14:43,270
It was a real problem with it.

5388
02:14:43,690 --> 02:14:44,080
I have,

5389
02:14:44,080 --> 02:14:45,580
I actually have several friends,

5390
02:14:45,610 --> 02:14:47,200
one a that lives on the east coast.

5391
02:14:47,201 --> 02:14:48,160
I don't talk to him that often,

5392
02:14:48,161 --> 02:14:49,420
but he's got a real problem with it.

5393
02:14:49,450 --> 02:14:50,530
He can't sleep without that shit.

5394
02:14:50,700 --> 02:14:51,590
Best Sleep I ever got.

5395
02:14:51,630 --> 02:14:51,931
I mean,

5396
02:14:51,931 --> 02:14:52,800
I had that.

5397
02:14:52,850 --> 02:14:53,910
That is the other side to it.

5398
02:14:54,180 --> 02:14:55,140
You're in a fucking,

5399
02:14:55,680 --> 02:14:56,513
you're in a coma.

5400
02:14:56,650 --> 02:14:57,560
I'm not interested.

5401
02:14:57,580 --> 02:14:58,420
Cma,

5402
02:14:58,720 --> 02:14:59,280
yeah,

5403
02:14:59,280 --> 02:15:00,380
I think zinc,

5404
02:15:00,381 --> 02:15:01,220
magnesium,

5405
02:15:01,670 --> 02:15:02,141
this slot,

5406
02:15:02,141 --> 02:15:02,630
a lot of,

5407
02:15:02,630 --> 02:15:03,231
a lot of different,

5408
02:15:03,231 --> 02:15:03,700
but you know,

5409
02:15:03,700 --> 02:15:04,071
then again,

5410
02:15:04,071 --> 02:15:06,140
my brain doesn't work
the way your brain does.

5411
02:15:06,240 --> 02:15:08,180
I get obsessed with shit,

5412
02:15:08,181 --> 02:15:10,160
but I get obsessed like a singular,

5413
02:15:10,250 --> 02:15:11,210
I get obsessed like,

5414
02:15:11,211 --> 02:15:11,750
uh,

5415
02:15:11,750 --> 02:15:14,360
like there'll be like something
whenever it is video game,

5416
02:15:14,660 --> 02:15:15,560
playing pool,

5417
02:15:15,950 --> 02:15:16,581
Jujitsu,

5418
02:15:16,581 --> 02:15:17,151
whatever it is,

5419
02:15:17,151 --> 02:15:21,530
and then that starts taking over my entire
day and then everybody else has just

5420
02:15:21,950 --> 02:15:24,800
taken up time before I
get back on the mat again.

5421
02:15:24,830 --> 02:15:26,590
Or taking time before I
can go play pool again.

5422
02:15:26,770 --> 02:15:27,230
Anytime,

5423
02:15:27,230 --> 02:15:27,790
you know,

5424
02:15:27,790 --> 02:15:28,270
that's,

5425
02:15:28,270 --> 02:15:29,780
I have an issue with that where I don't,

5426
02:15:29,810 --> 02:15:31,310
I'm not like a good balance her,

5427
02:15:31,870 --> 02:15:32,271
you know,

5428
02:15:32,271 --> 02:15:37,190
I do a lot of different shit and
luckily it just sort of organically fits

5429
02:15:37,191 --> 02:15:38,024
together.

5430
02:15:38,120 --> 02:15:39,290
But if it was just me,

5431
02:15:39,291 --> 02:15:41,540
I could go off the rails into
the woods on either one of them.

5432
02:15:42,010 --> 02:15:42,440
Right,

5433
02:15:42,440 --> 02:15:42,800
right.

5434
02:15:42,800 --> 02:15:43,140
You know,

5435
02:15:43,140 --> 02:15:46,340
it's almost like I need a
bunch of different things
to fixate on all the time.

5436
02:15:46,400 --> 02:15:47,233
That's my,

5437
02:15:47,450 --> 02:15:48,283
my issue.

5438
02:15:48,470 --> 02:15:49,303
That's great though.

5439
02:15:49,310 --> 02:15:49,700
Yeah.

5440
02:15:49,700 --> 02:15:50,930
I have a hard time just chilling out.

5441
02:15:50,931 --> 02:15:51,710
I can't just like,

5442
02:15:51,710 --> 02:15:52,670
I have a hard time.

5443
02:15:52,900 --> 02:15:53,681
I'm the same way.

5444
02:15:53,681 --> 02:15:54,250
I,

5445
02:15:54,250 --> 02:15:54,760
I know

5446
02:15:54,760 --> 02:15:57,700
I'm learning how to vacation and
I was like some new shit for me.

5447
02:15:57,730 --> 02:15:59,470
I liked doing it now like I'm getting,

5448
02:15:59,500 --> 02:16:00,333
I'm getting to the,

5449
02:16:00,490 --> 02:16:01,240
the idea of,

5450
02:16:01,240 --> 02:16:03,640
but before I go on vacation,

5451
02:16:03,641 --> 02:16:04,780
I have this wild,

5452
02:16:04,781 --> 02:16:06,760
crazy buildup where like,

5453
02:16:06,761 --> 02:16:08,770
I burned myself out physically.

5454
02:16:08,800 --> 02:16:11,470
So I don't feel bad that I'm not
going to work out on vacation.

5455
02:16:12,040 --> 02:16:12,341
You know?

5456
02:16:12,341 --> 02:16:13,031
I have like all these,

5457
02:16:13,031 --> 02:16:16,480
I write a shitload so that I
don't feel bad for not writing.

5458
02:16:16,770 --> 02:16:17,603
Yeah,

5459
02:16:17,760 --> 02:16:18,210
I dunno.

5460
02:16:18,210 --> 02:16:18,890
So that's,

5461
02:16:18,890 --> 02:16:20,480
that's my relaxing I've been doing lately.

5462
02:16:20,481 --> 02:16:22,590
The year it's watching
coal seasons of movies.

5463
02:16:22,740 --> 02:16:24,000
Like that's actually like,

5464
02:16:24,180 --> 02:16:25,200
I just been a sons of anarchy.

5465
02:16:25,201 --> 02:16:26,034
You Watch that?

5466
02:16:26,070 --> 02:16:26,371
No,

5467
02:16:26,371 --> 02:16:27,090
I don't watch that.

5468
02:16:27,090 --> 02:16:27,781
I watched it once.

5469
02:16:27,781 --> 02:16:28,550
I didn't like it.

5470
02:16:28,550 --> 02:16:29,670
He would give another shot,

5471
02:16:29,780 --> 02:16:30,560
fucking

5472
02:16:30,560 --> 02:16:31,090
talk.

5473
02:16:31,090 --> 02:16:31,830
Shit,

5474
02:16:31,830 --> 02:16:32,470
can you get me?

5475
02:16:32,470 --> 02:16:32,890
But like,

5476
02:16:32,890 --> 02:16:33,970
Olin's got my love.

5477
02:16:34,140 --> 02:16:34,821
I like that.

5478
02:16:34,821 --> 02:16:35,830
I was watched the whole thing.

5479
02:16:35,840 --> 02:16:36,700
I machine homeland.

5480
02:16:36,850 --> 02:16:37,150
No,

5481
02:16:37,150 --> 02:16:38,980
shut the fuck up about sons of anarchy.

5482
02:16:38,981 --> 02:16:39,341
God Damn,

5483
02:16:39,341 --> 02:16:39,641
really?

5484
02:16:39,641 --> 02:16:41,320
You don't even know how good homeland is.

5485
02:16:41,710 --> 02:16:42,190
Homeland,

5486
02:16:42,190 --> 02:16:43,960
it's fucking sensational.

5487
02:16:44,470 --> 02:16:46,030
It's one of the best
shows I've ever watched.

5488
02:16:46,090 --> 02:16:47,350
I'm on season two right now.

5489
02:16:48,380 --> 02:16:49,690
Oh yeah.

5490
02:16:49,691 --> 02:16:53,320
I watched all of season one and I was
not excited about this other than the

5491
02:16:53,321 --> 02:16:54,850
recommendations people were giving him.

5492
02:16:54,851 --> 02:16:56,920
It didn't seem like anything that
was really interested in and I'm like

5493
02:16:57,280 --> 02:16:58,810
terrorists sort of drama.

5494
02:16:58,811 --> 02:16:59,281
Like why?

5495
02:16:59,281 --> 02:17:00,340
Why do I want to watch this?

5496
02:17:00,730 --> 02:17:01,600
But God,

5497
02:17:03,730 --> 02:17:06,190
God damn is it good every
time that show ends,

5498
02:17:06,191 --> 02:17:06,461
I go,

5499
02:17:06,461 --> 02:17:06,971
damn,

5500
02:17:06,971 --> 02:17:07,870
that's a good show.

5501
02:17:08,170 --> 02:17:09,760
And it makes you realize like,

5502
02:17:09,761 --> 02:17:14,410
I'm really appreciate the artwork of
making a great television show because it

5503
02:17:14,411 --> 02:17:16,330
only comes along like once a year.

5504
02:17:16,480 --> 02:17:16,640
You know,

5505
02:17:16,640 --> 02:17:19,990
like once a year you got to breaking
bad or you gotta soprano's or something

5506
02:17:19,991 --> 02:17:20,471
like that.

5507
02:17:20,471 --> 02:17:21,010
You know,

5508
02:17:21,010 --> 02:17:22,630
it's like not even once a year.

5509
02:17:22,750 --> 02:17:23,920
Once every two or three years.

5510
02:17:23,950 --> 02:17:28,030
More so now I think than ever before
because there's so many of them on there's

5511
02:17:28,750 --> 02:17:29,830
a boardwalk empire,

5512
02:17:29,831 --> 02:17:30,910
which is sensational.

5513
02:17:30,911 --> 02:17:32,020
I just started getting into that.

5514
02:17:32,260 --> 02:17:32,921
There's a,

5515
02:17:32,921 --> 02:17:35,020
of course you got the um,

5516
02:17:35,290 --> 02:17:36,030
uh,

5517
02:17:36,030 --> 02:17:36,380
there's,

5518
02:17:36,380 --> 02:17:36,850
there's,

5519
02:17:36,850 --> 02:17:40,090
there's so many Dexter's
I don't like the extreme.

5520
02:17:40,110 --> 02:17:40,943
The more I watched Dexter,

5521
02:17:41,180 --> 02:17:43,270
that's that hope had the
funniest tweet you gave up on it.

5522
02:17:43,490 --> 02:17:43,960
The street.

5523
02:17:43,960 --> 02:17:44,321
Thanks Dad.

5524
02:17:44,321 --> 02:17:44,940
Hope you said,

5525
02:17:44,940 --> 02:17:45,490
uh,

5526
02:17:45,490 --> 02:17:47,770
it would be less realistic
if they had a cartoon.

5527
02:17:49,010 --> 02:17:51,070
More realistic of had a
cracked tooth next to Dexter.

5528
02:17:51,100 --> 02:17:51,940
Like walking around.

5529
02:17:52,960 --> 02:17:56,190
I kept picturing that next day.

5530
02:17:56,590 --> 02:17:56,891
Well,

5531
02:17:56,891 --> 02:17:58,760
I gave up on Dexter when uh,

5532
02:17:59,290 --> 02:18:00,340
the fuck is his name.

5533
02:18:00,760 --> 02:18:04,210
John John Lithgow choked
out chicken a proud tub.

5534
02:18:04,211 --> 02:18:07,310
It was the worst name
ever seen in my life.

5535
02:18:07,800 --> 02:18:08,980
So unrealistic.

5536
02:18:09,280 --> 02:18:10,840
I could never watch the show again.

5537
02:18:11,890 --> 02:18:12,431
He didn't,

5538
02:18:12,431 --> 02:18:13,690
he didn't really choker,

5539
02:18:13,900 --> 02:18:14,650
he didn't,

5540
02:18:14,650 --> 02:18:16,150
there was no real choking.

5541
02:18:16,151 --> 02:18:16,984
I'm sorry.

5542
02:18:17,000 --> 02:18:18,280
If you're going to fight back,

5543
02:18:18,281 --> 02:18:19,240
you got to try to get out of this.

5544
02:18:19,790 --> 02:18:19,990
What?

5545
02:18:19,990 --> 02:18:21,790
I'm just choking you and cutting your leg.

5546
02:18:21,900 --> 02:18:24,880
You would be fucking flailing like death.

5547
02:18:24,881 --> 02:18:26,080
It would be insane

5548
02:18:27,820 --> 02:18:28,780
if a guy,

5549
02:18:28,810 --> 02:18:30,850
if a guy is going to
choke someone to death,

5550
02:18:30,880 --> 02:18:31,540
okay,

5551
02:18:31,540 --> 02:18:33,280
there's a struggle involved in that.

5552
02:18:33,281 --> 02:18:34,180
Even with a chick,

5553
02:18:34,210 --> 02:18:37,690
you're going to realize your life
is on the line and even even,

5554
02:18:37,740 --> 02:18:38,920
even if it's fruitless,

5555
02:18:38,921 --> 02:18:40,050
there's going to be an attempt at,

5556
02:18:40,390 --> 02:18:44,920
it was the worst rear naked choke have
ever seen and it made me angry and as an

5557
02:18:44,921 --> 02:18:48,760
MMA commentator and a Brazilian Jiu
Jitsu black on that scene wasn't really,

5558
02:18:48,770 --> 02:18:48,941
I'm,

5559
02:18:48,941 --> 02:18:49,360
no,

5560
02:18:49,360 --> 02:18:50,193
I won't do it.

5561
02:18:50,590 --> 02:18:51,423
It was fake.

5562
02:18:51,430 --> 02:18:52,240
It was just such a,

5563
02:18:52,240 --> 02:18:52,840
look,

5564
02:18:52,840 --> 02:18:53,830
this Claire Danes,

5565
02:18:53,831 --> 02:18:55,300
chick who's in homeland,

5566
02:18:55,510 --> 02:18:58,420
this bitch can act her tits off.

5567
02:18:59,050 --> 02:19:00,730
She's so good.

5568
02:19:00,940 --> 02:19:01,990
She's so good.

5569
02:19:02,320 --> 02:19:03,400
Mrs Rogan said it best.

5570
02:19:03,401 --> 02:19:06,550
She said that watching her and then
you watch the other people act.

5571
02:19:06,551 --> 02:19:06,791
You're like,

5572
02:19:06,791 --> 02:19:08,320
what the fuck are you all doing?

5573
02:19:08,350 --> 02:19:09,430
Do you see what she's doing?

5574
02:19:09,730 --> 02:19:10,330
Cause this is,

5575
02:19:10,330 --> 02:19:13,930
I mean she plays a crazy person in
it too and it's just off the chart.

5576
02:19:13,960 --> 02:19:14,770
Good.

5577
02:19:14,770 --> 02:19:16,960
She's so good that when you,

5578
02:19:16,961 --> 02:19:17,794
you know,

5579
02:19:17,830 --> 02:19:20,870
you compare it to like crappy
acting or boring acting.

5580
02:19:20,890 --> 02:19:21,723
It's just like,

5581
02:19:21,790 --> 02:19:22,720
come on man.

5582
02:19:22,950 --> 02:19:24,210
It's hard because once again,

5583
02:19:24,211 --> 02:19:24,751
it's like people,

5584
02:19:24,751 --> 02:19:25,840
they want to become a famous,

5585
02:19:25,890 --> 02:19:27,060
they don't want to
actually study the craft.

5586
02:19:27,080 --> 02:19:31,280
And then Claire Danes went to like
Oxford or like England crazy school tube,

5587
02:19:31,450 --> 02:19:31,820
bro.

5588
02:19:31,820 --> 02:19:32,653
Let me tell you something.

5589
02:19:33,210 --> 02:19:34,100
You can't be,

5590
02:19:34,310 --> 02:19:38,270
you can't act crazy that good
unless you know crazy intimately.

5591
02:19:38,300 --> 02:19:39,020
That's true.

5592
02:19:39,020 --> 02:19:40,100
That's a good fucking show,

5593
02:19:40,101 --> 02:19:41,210
man at home when it's good show.

5594
02:19:41,211 --> 02:19:42,860
But you think about there's madman now,

5595
02:19:42,920 --> 02:19:44,510
which is apparently a very good show.

5596
02:19:44,870 --> 02:19:46,100
Boardwalk Empire.

5597
02:19:46,490 --> 02:19:47,323
You know,

5598
02:19:48,370 --> 02:19:49,203
I don't,

5599
02:19:49,220 --> 02:19:50,290
I think it was that good.

5600
02:19:50,480 --> 02:19:51,590
I've never seen it all.

5601
02:19:51,591 --> 02:19:52,424
You'd love it.

5602
02:19:52,520 --> 02:19:53,600
It's about a sex addict.

5603
02:19:53,601 --> 02:19:54,560
I didn't get if you'd like it.

5604
02:19:54,830 --> 02:19:55,650
You think it's good though?

5605
02:19:55,650 --> 02:19:55,870
Yeah,

5606
02:19:55,870 --> 02:19:56,410
it was great.

5607
02:19:56,410 --> 02:19:57,243
It's funny man.

5608
02:19:57,920 --> 02:19:58,940
He's an interesting cat,

5609
02:19:59,510 --> 02:19:59,871
you know,

5610
02:19:59,871 --> 02:20:02,090
to go from being the guy from,

5611
02:20:02,120 --> 02:20:02,930
you know Molly?

5612
02:20:02,930 --> 02:20:03,680
Yeah.

5613
02:20:03,680 --> 02:20:04,200
What was the name?

5614
02:20:04,200 --> 02:20:04,870
Older.

5615
02:20:04,870 --> 02:20:05,703
Older.

5616
02:20:05,740 --> 02:20:09,560
Older from the x files to being a sex
addict and then in real life he's a sex

5617
02:20:09,561 --> 02:20:11,630
addict supposedly yet.

5618
02:20:12,260 --> 02:20:13,280
But that's,

5619
02:20:13,430 --> 02:20:16,340
that's that whole sex
addict thing is hilarious.

5620
02:20:16,700 --> 02:20:19,250
It's a a funny a compulsion,

5621
02:20:19,490 --> 02:20:22,010
you know it's also like one of
those addictions is that like,

5622
02:20:22,040 --> 02:20:22,470
cause I,

5623
02:20:22,470 --> 02:20:25,700
I I actually went to a meeting one time,

5624
02:20:25,940 --> 02:20:27,320
I thought I was a second sex addict.

5625
02:20:27,380 --> 02:20:27,591
Why?

5626
02:20:27,591 --> 02:20:28,790
Because he likes girls.

5627
02:20:28,910 --> 02:20:29,150
No,

5628
02:20:29,150 --> 02:20:29,983
I went to one.

5629
02:20:30,220 --> 02:20:30,560
Yeah,

5630
02:20:30,560 --> 02:20:31,011
because why?

5631
02:20:31,011 --> 02:20:31,844
Because you like girls.

5632
02:20:31,850 --> 02:20:32,960
Well what happened was I was,

5633
02:20:33,140 --> 02:20:35,330
I had a girlfriend that like
I was sort of cheating on,

5634
02:20:35,620 --> 02:20:37,070
we weren't officially together,

5635
02:20:37,071 --> 02:20:37,910
but when we were together,

5636
02:20:37,911 --> 02:20:40,040
you know like you don't make an official
but you know you're supposed to be

5637
02:20:40,041 --> 02:20:40,874
together with the person.

5638
02:20:40,880 --> 02:20:41,713
Oh I see what you're saying.

5639
02:20:41,980 --> 02:20:45,200
And so you still have a
clause cause you know,

5640
02:20:45,560 --> 02:20:45,881
cause there,

5641
02:20:45,881 --> 02:20:48,830
well we never wrote anything down even
though we kind of live together now.

5642
02:20:48,860 --> 02:20:49,590
Right.

5643
02:20:49,590 --> 02:20:50,423
So let me,

5644
02:20:50,750 --> 02:20:51,471
so then I was like,

5645
02:20:51,471 --> 02:20:51,950
you know what,

5646
02:20:51,950 --> 02:20:52,490
I'm sorry.

5647
02:20:52,490 --> 02:20:52,911
Cause what happened,

5648
02:20:52,911 --> 02:20:53,271
I was getting,

5649
02:20:53,271 --> 02:20:56,420
I was actually getting a blow job and
my phone was on and the girl heard me

5650
02:20:56,421 --> 02:20:58,570
talking and then I go up and
heard me talking shit like baby,

5651
02:20:58,571 --> 02:20:59,210
you liked that.

5652
02:20:59,210 --> 02:21:01,790
But he also know when she called,

5653
02:21:01,791 --> 02:21:02,301
it was so,

5654
02:21:02,301 --> 02:21:03,380
it was like just a fucking,

5655
02:21:03,700 --> 02:21:05,810
I was like caught in the
act because I was not good.

5656
02:21:05,840 --> 02:21:06,680
So I said to her,

5657
02:21:06,710 --> 02:21:06,951
listen,

5658
02:21:06,951 --> 02:21:07,760
I'll go to a meeting.

5659
02:21:07,760 --> 02:21:07,880
I,

5660
02:21:07,880 --> 02:21:08,081
I'm,

5661
02:21:08,081 --> 02:21:08,571
I'm a sex.

5662
02:21:08,571 --> 02:21:11,260
I used the sex addicts like that.

5663
02:21:11,300 --> 02:21:11,601
Get Out.

5664
02:21:11,601 --> 02:21:14,000
I figured that was the best
way to like get out of this.

5665
02:21:14,030 --> 02:21:16,660
So I went to a meeting and
I figured those meetings,

5666
02:21:16,661 --> 02:21:17,820
we are creative place to get lunch.

5667
02:21:17,900 --> 02:21:18,440
No,

5668
02:21:18,440 --> 02:21:18,741
no,

5669
02:21:18,741 --> 02:21:19,340
no.

5670
02:21:19,340 --> 02:21:20,173
Well

5671
02:21:21,240 --> 02:21:23,540
one of the things they ask,

5672
02:21:23,541 --> 02:21:25,550
how many people here are
required to be heard by law?

5673
02:21:25,580 --> 02:21:26,210
Right.

5674
02:21:26,210 --> 02:21:27,800
And then like a bunch of hands go up.

5675
02:21:28,070 --> 02:21:29,000
Those are the molesters.

5676
02:21:29,480 --> 02:21:32,030
So then the whole time I'm looking
at them wondering what they did.

5677
02:21:32,340 --> 02:21:35,820
Just trying to figure out what they're
guilty for so I couldn't even function.

5678
02:21:35,821 --> 02:21:36,830
I'm probably not a molester.

5679
02:21:36,831 --> 02:21:38,330
Probably someone who got
caught with a hooker,

5680
02:21:38,420 --> 02:21:39,620
that's probably more correct.

5681
02:21:40,390 --> 02:21:42,110
Was trying to figure it out.

5682
02:21:42,260 --> 02:21:43,410
Probably do two buses.

5683
02:21:43,560 --> 02:21:44,720
Like street walkers.

5684
02:21:44,900 --> 02:21:45,051
Like,

5685
02:21:45,051 --> 02:21:46,370
if you're a guy and you look,

5686
02:21:46,371 --> 02:21:48,800
if you're a girl and you
get caught for prostitution,

5687
02:21:48,830 --> 02:21:49,663
it's,

5688
02:21:49,750 --> 02:21:50,240
you know,

5689
02:21:50,240 --> 02:21:51,890
there's a lot of cops
looking for prostitutes.

5690
02:21:51,891 --> 02:21:54,530
But if you're a guy and you
get caught with a prostitute,

5691
02:21:54,531 --> 02:21:56,750
it seems to me at least they'll like,

5692
02:21:56,751 --> 02:21:57,590
you got to fuck up,

5693
02:21:57,591 --> 02:21:58,610
you've got to do something stupid,

5694
02:21:58,611 --> 02:21:58,920
you know,

5695
02:21:58,920 --> 02:21:59,753
street walking,

5696
02:22:00,080 --> 02:22:00,913
you know,

5697
02:22:01,190 --> 02:22:02,240
for the guy to get busted,

5698
02:22:02,241 --> 02:22:04,010
he's probably driving around in his car,

5699
02:22:04,011 --> 02:22:08,120
picking up hookers and the cops come
up and they see you do with a wig.

5700
02:22:08,420 --> 02:22:08,770
Paul,

5701
02:22:08,770 --> 02:22:11,010
I went down to your place,

5702
02:22:11,020 --> 02:22:11,853
I would come off.

5703
02:22:11,900 --> 02:22:12,420
But if you're mad,

5704
02:22:12,420 --> 02:22:13,251
some people don't.

5705
02:22:13,251 --> 02:22:13,900
There's that.

5706
02:22:13,900 --> 02:22:16,160
There's some people don't want
them to know where they live,

5707
02:22:16,161 --> 02:22:18,950
but I mean it's like there's not a
lot of guys who get busted with that.

5708
02:22:18,951 --> 02:22:19,580
I would think.

5709
02:22:19,580 --> 02:22:22,530
I would think that more of
more women get busted then,

5710
02:22:22,540 --> 02:22:23,151
then guys.

5711
02:22:23,151 --> 02:22:23,984
Right.

5712
02:22:24,080 --> 02:22:24,913
Uh,

5713
02:22:25,230 --> 02:22:25,771
I would think,

5714
02:22:25,771 --> 02:22:25,930
I don't,

5715
02:22:25,930 --> 02:22:26,080
I

5716
02:22:26,080 --> 02:22:26,710
don't know anybody.

5717
02:22:26,710 --> 02:22:27,690
Everybody wants to with a hooker.

5718
02:22:27,780 --> 02:22:28,800
I've never heard of that before.

5719
02:22:29,160 --> 02:22:29,840
Yeah.

5720
02:22:29,840 --> 02:22:30,261
But so,

5721
02:22:30,261 --> 02:22:30,720
but that would,

5722
02:22:30,720 --> 02:22:31,531
that would be though,

5723
02:22:31,531 --> 02:22:34,020
I would think you would have to
take like sex addiction counseling.

5724
02:22:34,420 --> 02:22:35,450
If you got busted with a hooker,

5725
02:22:35,460 --> 02:22:35,851
they would say,

5726
02:22:35,851 --> 02:22:36,600
Hey,

5727
02:22:36,600 --> 02:22:37,500
what's your problem?

5728
02:22:37,560 --> 02:22:38,760
You're a sex addict.

5729
02:22:39,180 --> 02:22:39,490
Don't.

5730
02:22:39,490 --> 02:22:40,323
Wow.

5731
02:22:40,590 --> 02:22:43,570
How about the dude just
needed a blowjob and yeah.

5732
02:22:45,110 --> 02:22:45,943
It's so funny.

5733
02:22:46,380 --> 02:22:47,041
It's so funny.

5734
02:22:47,041 --> 02:22:47,701
He's an addict.

5735
02:22:47,701 --> 02:22:48,361
It feels good.

5736
02:22:48,361 --> 02:22:50,130
You're addicted and things that feel good.

5737
02:22:50,490 --> 02:22:51,740
I know there is,

5738
02:22:52,050 --> 02:22:53,550
the Buzzword is undeniable though.

5739
02:22:53,551 --> 02:22:54,720
Compulsive activity.

5740
02:22:54,721 --> 02:22:54,991
You know,

5741
02:22:54,991 --> 02:22:55,111
when,

5742
02:22:55,111 --> 02:22:55,440
when,

5743
02:22:55,440 --> 02:22:56,400
when people,

5744
02:22:56,670 --> 02:22:58,350
when someone is like one of those guys,

5745
02:22:58,351 --> 02:23:01,650
it's like jerking off like on
his iPhone while he's driving.

5746
02:23:01,830 --> 02:23:02,191
Like there's,

5747
02:23:02,191 --> 02:23:03,180
there's people that do that.

5748
02:23:03,970 --> 02:23:04,461
Oh yeah.

5749
02:23:04,461 --> 02:23:04,531
Oh,

5750
02:23:04,531 --> 02:23:04,830
the world.

5751
02:23:04,830 --> 02:23:05,800
The worst time I did was,

5752
02:23:05,801 --> 02:23:06,634
uh,

5753
02:23:06,640 --> 02:23:10,210
I was in Korea doing comedy for like the
troops and there's a place called like

5754
02:23:10,211 --> 02:23:10,841
Hooker Hill,

5755
02:23:10,841 --> 02:23:11,260
right?

5756
02:23:11,260 --> 02:23:12,430
It's called the Hooker Hill.

5757
02:23:12,490 --> 02:23:13,100
And it's like,

5758
02:23:13,100 --> 02:23:15,220
and it's all these like
girls that did the columns,

5759
02:23:15,221 --> 02:23:16,010
them see girls,

5760
02:23:16,010 --> 02:23:16,580
ladies,

5761
02:23:16,580 --> 02:23:17,830
these Korean hookers,

5762
02:23:17,920 --> 02:23:21,160
you buy him shoes for like
$10 then now your friend,

5763
02:23:21,610 --> 02:23:22,240
you know,

5764
02:23:22,240 --> 02:23:23,080
for the rest of the night,

5765
02:23:23,340 --> 02:23:26,980
what's the $10 and like won't tell you
that they talk to you for a couple of

5766
02:23:26,980 --> 02:23:26,981
hours.

5767
02:23:26,981 --> 02:23:27,340
Right?

5768
02:23:27,340 --> 02:23:27,461
Oh,

5769
02:23:27,461 --> 02:23:28,080
they talk to you,

5770
02:23:28,080 --> 02:23:28,450
but then I,

5771
02:23:28,450 --> 02:23:30,220
but then you can
negotiate some other shit.

5772
02:23:30,370 --> 02:23:30,881
So I was say,

5773
02:23:30,881 --> 02:23:33,150
I was in Korea and then
some girl was like,

5774
02:23:33,160 --> 02:23:35,200
well how much her hand
job and she's like $100.

5775
02:23:35,350 --> 02:23:35,560
I'm like,

5776
02:23:35,560 --> 02:23:36,161
I'll give you 10.

5777
02:23:36,161 --> 02:23:36,371
It's like,

5778
02:23:36,371 --> 02:23:37,180
fine.

5779
02:23:37,180 --> 02:23:38,013
Whoa.

5780
02:23:39,010 --> 02:23:39,430
Yeah.

5781
02:23:39,430 --> 02:23:40,360
So we'd go in the back.

5782
02:23:40,361 --> 02:23:41,194
Right.

5783
02:23:41,340 --> 02:23:44,380
So we got Asians usually so
much better at negotiating.

5784
02:23:44,950 --> 02:23:46,180
So we go into back and she's like,

5785
02:23:46,181 --> 02:23:46,751
what do you do?

5786
02:23:46,751 --> 02:23:47,020
I'm like,

5787
02:23:47,020 --> 02:23:47,141
Oh,

5788
02:23:47,141 --> 02:23:47,831
I'm a comedian.

5789
02:23:47,831 --> 02:23:48,440
And she goes,

5790
02:23:48,440 --> 02:23:49,211
it takes my dick and goes,

5791
02:23:49,211 --> 02:23:49,511
hey,

5792
02:23:49,511 --> 02:23:50,344
Jerry.

5793
02:23:52,040 --> 02:23:52,873
And I didn't,

5794
02:23:52,970 --> 02:23:57,220
I didn't know if she meant like
Jerry Lewis or Jerry Seinfeld,

5795
02:23:57,221 --> 02:23:58,031
I couldn't figure out.

5796
02:23:58,031 --> 02:23:59,740
That's what I'm thinking about
while getting the hand job,

5797
02:23:59,741 --> 02:24:00,100
you know?

5798
02:24:00,100 --> 02:24:00,933
Wow.

5799
02:24:01,030 --> 02:24:02,770
So she used you tick as a microphone?

5800
02:24:03,220 --> 02:24:03,640
Yeah,

5801
02:24:03,640 --> 02:24:04,450
it was,

5802
02:24:04,450 --> 02:24:06,450
it was ridiculous and no,

5803
02:24:06,460 --> 02:24:06,910
no,

5804
02:24:06,910 --> 02:24:07,060
no,

5805
02:24:07,060 --> 02:24:07,421
it was,

5806
02:24:07,421 --> 02:24:08,770
it was fucking absurd.

5807
02:24:08,800 --> 02:24:09,550
I was like,

5808
02:24:09,550 --> 02:24:09,821
that was,

5809
02:24:09,821 --> 02:24:09,901
yeah,

5810
02:24:09,901 --> 02:24:10,471
I was young.

5811
02:24:10,471 --> 02:24:12,100
I was 23 Hooker Hill.

5812
02:24:12,101 --> 02:24:12,850
Huh?

5813
02:24:12,850 --> 02:24:14,590
What part of Korea is outside of Seoul?

5814
02:24:14,591 --> 02:24:14,751
Right.

5815
02:24:14,751 --> 02:24:15,401
I was going to soul.

5816
02:24:15,401 --> 02:24:15,671
Yeah.

5817
02:24:15,671 --> 02:24:16,120
I mean it's,

5818
02:24:16,120 --> 02:24:16,900
what is soul like?

5819
02:24:16,900 --> 02:24:18,010
It's gotta be a strange place.

5820
02:24:18,490 --> 02:24:18,940
Uh,

5821
02:24:18,940 --> 02:24:21,940
it's very like a lot of cheap clothes,

5822
02:24:22,300 --> 02:24:23,050
Hooker Hill.

5823
02:24:23,050 --> 02:24:24,160
But like you walk into the hook,

5824
02:24:24,200 --> 02:24:27,850
the bar and all of a sudden and
all of a sudden heads come up,

5825
02:24:27,851 --> 02:24:28,631
like walk them all,

5826
02:24:28,631 --> 02:24:28,811
you know,

5827
02:24:28,811 --> 02:24:32,950
like all of a sudden like this
random Korean hookers heads go up.

5828
02:24:32,980 --> 02:24:33,610
But uh,

5829
02:24:33,610 --> 02:24:33,831
yeah,

5830
02:24:33,831 --> 02:24:35,190
I know I went to Korea.

5831
02:24:35,310 --> 02:24:35,801
The weirdest,

5832
02:24:35,801 --> 02:24:37,690
I was in Bahrain doing
comedy for the military.

5833
02:24:37,750 --> 02:24:38,650
I did like Saudi Arabia,

5834
02:24:38,651 --> 02:24:39,011
Japan,

5835
02:24:39,011 --> 02:24:39,251
Korea,

5836
02:24:39,251 --> 02:24:40,084
Guam,

5837
02:24:40,390 --> 02:24:40,870
Cuba,

5838
02:24:40,870 --> 02:24:41,381
Guantanamo Bay,

5839
02:24:41,381 --> 02:24:42,180
Cuba.

5840
02:24:42,180 --> 02:24:43,390
But it was funny cause like,

5841
02:24:43,900 --> 02:24:45,100
but I'll talk about Bahrain.

5842
02:24:45,190 --> 02:24:46,150
So I'm like,

5843
02:24:46,180 --> 02:24:47,800
there's like this club in Bahrain,

5844
02:24:47,801 --> 02:24:49,330
it's like English,

5845
02:24:49,540 --> 02:24:50,440
British are there,

5846
02:24:50,500 --> 02:24:52,660
the Saudi like whatever people that,

5847
02:24:52,661 --> 02:24:54,070
people from Saudi Arabia
that are like sending,

5848
02:24:54,071 --> 02:24:56,170
because Allah isn't in Bahrain,

5849
02:24:56,200 --> 02:24:57,370
but he's in Saudi Arabia.

5850
02:24:57,371 --> 02:25:00,190
So that's where they go to like cheat
on their wives and get hookers and drugs

5851
02:25:00,191 --> 02:25:00,880
and drink,

5852
02:25:00,880 --> 02:25:01,520
wait a minute,

5853
02:25:01,520 --> 02:25:01,990
what,

5854
02:25:01,990 --> 02:25:02,823
how's it work?

5855
02:25:02,920 --> 02:25:06,580
Cause like as long as
they leave Saudi Arabia,

5856
02:25:07,220 --> 02:25:07,721
what I mean,

5857
02:25:07,721 --> 02:25:08,560
this is what people told me,

5858
02:25:08,561 --> 02:25:08,831
I'm not,

5859
02:25:08,831 --> 02:25:09,130
you know,

5860
02:25:09,130 --> 02:25:10,150
that's a good religions.

5861
02:25:10,660 --> 02:25:13,600
So then they would talk flight
and you just get your freak on.

5862
02:25:14,470 --> 02:25:17,650
So there was like a Filipino band
playing karaoke band that were dope.

5863
02:25:17,650 --> 02:25:19,210
They had a big hit in the
eighties or something.

5864
02:25:19,530 --> 02:25:22,210
So all these like Korean
hookers dancing around.

5865
02:25:22,211 --> 02:25:22,530
So I,

5866
02:25:22,530 --> 02:25:25,190
I make with one of them and I go
back to her whorehouse I'm like,

5867
02:25:25,191 --> 02:25:25,590
I I see,

5868
02:25:25,590 --> 02:25:26,920
and this is when my space first came out,

5869
02:25:26,921 --> 02:25:27,460
right?

5870
02:25:27,460 --> 02:25:31,540
So I go to this Korean whorehouse in
Bahrain and there were all these like

5871
02:25:31,550 --> 02:25:32,061
Americans,

5872
02:25:32,061 --> 02:25:33,280
like soldiers living there.

5873
02:25:33,310 --> 02:25:33,881
People were like,

5874
02:25:33,881 --> 02:25:34,280
can't make,

5875
02:25:34,280 --> 02:25:35,710
like Dave had moved into the whorehouse.

5876
02:25:35,711 --> 02:25:36,160
Right.

5877
02:25:36,160 --> 02:25:36,993
So I'm like,

5878
02:25:37,080 --> 02:25:38,600
oh that's her boyfriend living with the,

5879
02:25:38,640 --> 02:25:39,473
with the girls.

5880
02:25:39,640 --> 02:25:40,660
And then whoa.

5881
02:25:40,720 --> 02:25:42,100
So then I was like trying to get,

5882
02:25:42,101 --> 02:25:42,460
like,

5883
02:25:42,460 --> 02:25:42,810
I'm like,

5884
02:25:42,810 --> 02:25:44,410
I take one over to the computer.

5885
02:25:44,411 --> 02:25:45,420
They had a computer that was like a,

5886
02:25:45,620 --> 02:25:46,000
you know,

5887
02:25:46,000 --> 02:25:47,530
apple 84 or something,

5888
02:25:47,531 --> 02:25:48,040
you know.

5889
02:25:48,040 --> 02:25:49,000
So I'm trying to show you one of them

5890
02:25:49,210 --> 02:25:50,470
my myspace page

5891
02:25:55,150 --> 02:25:58,210
and I'm trying to look in the
Korean to English language to like,

5892
02:25:58,380 --> 02:25:58,640
no,

5893
02:25:58,640 --> 02:26:00,070
a comedian explained comedy,

5894
02:26:00,071 --> 02:26:00,490
you know,

5895
02:26:00,490 --> 02:26:01,250
so funny.

5896
02:26:01,250 --> 02:26:01,840
And then the,

5897
02:26:01,840 --> 02:26:03,800
then the hooker mom kicked me out.

5898
02:26:03,830 --> 02:26:04,161
She was like,

5899
02:26:04,161 --> 02:26:06,020
you can't stay unless you're
going to buy one of the hookers.

5900
02:26:06,080 --> 02:26:06,301
Oh,

5901
02:26:06,301 --> 02:26:07,280
that's hilarious.

5902
02:26:07,610 --> 02:26:08,960
It seems like that would be pretty cheap.

5903
02:26:09,000 --> 02:26:09,890
You just didn't want to pay.

5904
02:26:10,160 --> 02:26:12,410
I didn't want to have sex
and I don't like to have,

5905
02:26:12,650 --> 02:26:15,410
didn't you feel like you owed him some
money just for wasting all the time?

5906
02:26:15,710 --> 02:26:16,071
No.

5907
02:26:16,071 --> 02:26:18,860
I love to waste bringing them
over to a computer and look,

5908
02:26:18,870 --> 02:26:19,641
this is me.

5909
02:26:19,641 --> 02:26:20,780
This is me to like listen,

5910
02:26:21,050 --> 02:26:21,370
if,

5911
02:26:21,370 --> 02:26:22,490
well this is a hooker place.

5912
02:26:22,880 --> 02:26:24,410
We're not here to look
at your fucking resume.

5913
02:26:24,840 --> 02:26:25,610
Yeah,

5914
02:26:25,610 --> 02:26:25,790
no,

5915
02:26:25,790 --> 02:26:26,623
I like wasted people.

5916
02:26:27,030 --> 02:26:27,761
I find that funny.

5917
02:26:27,761 --> 02:26:29,770
I ended up beating up the
other comic on the tour,

5918
02:26:29,850 --> 02:26:30,610
uh,

5919
02:26:30,610 --> 02:26:31,840
because you beat him up,

5920
02:26:32,950 --> 02:26:33,670
throw him on his head.

5921
02:26:33,670 --> 02:26:37,110
What happened was this guy like
I'm supposed to go with Gleed.

5922
02:26:37,290 --> 02:26:38,590
It was one of my best friends bank leap,

5923
02:26:38,650 --> 02:26:39,790
but he had to bail out.

5924
02:26:39,791 --> 02:26:41,380
So I end up going with
this other guy from Texas.

5925
02:26:41,440 --> 02:26:43,210
Black comic was most racist guy.

5926
02:26:43,450 --> 02:26:44,590
You go would go up there and be like,

5927
02:26:44,740 --> 02:26:46,810
George Bush is a fucking
asshole to the military.

5928
02:26:47,170 --> 02:26:50,410
And he would close with like peanut
butter on his cock with dog licking off.

5929
02:26:50,411 --> 02:26:54,200
And I had to do his time and he kept
calling me a fag in front of all the

5930
02:26:54,210 --> 02:26:54,810
soldiers.

5931
02:26:54,810 --> 02:26:55,470
Adam's a fair,

5932
02:26:55,470 --> 02:26:56,303
I don't feel it goes,

5933
02:26:56,470 --> 02:26:57,360
it just wouldn't stop.

5934
02:26:57,361 --> 02:26:58,194
Why was he doing?

5935
02:26:58,240 --> 02:26:59,140
He was just a bully.

5936
02:26:59,170 --> 02:26:59,321
Like,

5937
02:26:59,321 --> 02:27:02,680
cause I said Eddie Murphy's movies
aren't as good anymore as they used to be

5938
02:27:02,790 --> 02:27:03,040
mad.

5939
02:27:03,040 --> 02:27:04,010
You don't know shit about anymore.

5940
02:27:04,120 --> 02:27:05,410
It was just giving me a hard time.

5941
02:27:05,440 --> 02:27:05,800
This guy,

5942
02:27:05,800 --> 02:27:06,420
right?

5943
02:27:06,420 --> 02:27:07,940
So there's an angry fellow.

5944
02:27:07,960 --> 02:27:10,210
So we get to Africa to boody Africa.

5945
02:27:10,310 --> 02:27:11,410
You kicked his ass in Africa

5946
02:27:12,630 --> 02:27:14,610
when the white man
kicks a black man's ass,

5947
02:27:14,670 --> 02:27:15,503
Africa

5948
02:27:16,790 --> 02:27:17,623
and I had to bail.

5949
02:27:18,150 --> 02:27:19,050
You brought in.

5950
02:27:19,080 --> 02:27:20,510
We brought them into
the country to kick it

5951
02:27:21,380 --> 02:27:23,090
and they shook us down and customs,

5952
02:27:23,091 --> 02:27:23,470
right.

5953
02:27:23,470 --> 02:27:24,790
You go to customs and they take our money.

5954
02:27:24,830 --> 02:27:25,670
It took his money.

5955
02:27:25,820 --> 02:27:26,600
We get to like,

5956
02:27:26,600 --> 02:27:27,411
it was all kind of weird.

5957
02:27:27,411 --> 02:27:30,320
So we go to steal your money
and I had to pay for it,

5958
02:27:30,810 --> 02:27:32,030
pay for him to get through customs.

5959
02:27:32,031 --> 02:27:32,300
Right.

5960
02:27:32,300 --> 02:27:33,133
Wow.

5961
02:27:33,450 --> 02:27:35,210
They steal like 50 bucks.

5962
02:27:35,240 --> 02:27:36,073
How's that work?

5963
02:27:36,160 --> 02:27:37,220
They were like a cost of y'all.

5964
02:27:37,221 --> 02:27:38,054
It's coming to the country.

5965
02:27:38,120 --> 02:27:39,440
Even though we already
paid with the vast boards,

5966
02:27:39,470 --> 02:27:40,490
we already had it all clear.

5967
02:27:40,520 --> 02:27:41,200
So they brought this,

5968
02:27:41,200 --> 02:27:41,450
you know,

5969
02:27:41,450 --> 02:27:43,370
that they didn't like
say give us your money.

5970
02:27:43,540 --> 02:27:44,373
He sold that money.

5971
02:27:44,600 --> 02:27:45,320
So,

5972
02:27:45,320 --> 02:27:48,530
so we go there and then we're in in
this Cantina with all the soldiers and I

5973
02:27:48,531 --> 02:27:48,891
have to,

5974
02:27:48,891 --> 02:27:51,050
and I'm ignoring this guy cause
he just keeps fucking with me.

5975
02:27:51,360 --> 02:27:51,610
Um,

5976
02:27:51,610 --> 02:27:52,101
so he's like,

5977
02:27:52,101 --> 02:27:52,760
Amen.

5978
02:27:52,760 --> 02:27:53,510
You're a fag.

5979
02:27:53,510 --> 02:27:55,610
You hooked up with trainees
in Saudi Arabia or something.

5980
02:27:55,610 --> 02:27:55,791
Right.

5981
02:27:55,791 --> 02:27:56,690
Which did not happen.

5982
02:27:57,450 --> 02:27:58,460
It didn't have so leave.

5983
02:27:58,490 --> 02:27:59,323
You would tell us.

5984
02:27:59,870 --> 02:28:00,703
I probably would.

5985
02:28:01,130 --> 02:28:01,581
So then,

5986
02:28:01,581 --> 02:28:02,414
uh,

5987
02:28:02,600 --> 02:28:03,470
so then the guy,

5988
02:28:03,560 --> 02:28:04,250
I like pushed it,

5989
02:28:04,250 --> 02:28:04,461
I'm like,

5990
02:28:04,461 --> 02:28:04,581
well,

5991
02:28:04,581 --> 02:28:04,970
let me fag.

5992
02:28:04,970 --> 02:28:08,900
I take his hat and push it down cause
then he comes at me and I over under and

5993
02:28:08,901 --> 02:28:10,220
just hip toss him on his head,

5994
02:28:10,770 --> 02:28:11,480
which was like,

5995
02:28:11,480 --> 02:28:12,080
you know,

5996
02:28:12,080 --> 02:28:13,220
probably had no idea it was coming.

5997
02:28:13,250 --> 02:28:13,941
No idea was coming.

5998
02:28:13,941 --> 02:28:14,691
And so I'm like,

5999
02:28:14,691 --> 02:28:15,351
who's the fact now?

6000
02:28:15,351 --> 02:28:15,650
You know?

6001
02:28:15,650 --> 02:28:17,750
And then the soldiers had
to break us up for fighting.

6002
02:28:17,780 --> 02:28:17,961
Right.

6003
02:28:17,961 --> 02:28:19,070
We came to entertain them.

6004
02:28:19,280 --> 02:28:20,120
Did you try to submit them?

6005
02:28:20,510 --> 02:28:20,841
No,

6006
02:28:20,841 --> 02:28:21,080
I,

6007
02:28:21,080 --> 02:28:21,913
I just was like,

6008
02:28:22,130 --> 02:28:22,881
you fucker like,

6009
02:28:22,881 --> 02:28:23,420
come on dude.

6010
02:28:23,420 --> 02:28:23,780
You know,

6011
02:28:23,780 --> 02:28:26,630
did you hit him at all when he's not
the guy we got broken up real quick,

6012
02:28:26,631 --> 02:28:27,080
but the,

6013
02:28:27,080 --> 02:28:30,230
the guy at sergeant Haggerty took
us into the bathroom and he's like,

6014
02:28:30,231 --> 02:28:31,220
what's wrong with you guys?

6015
02:28:31,340 --> 02:28:31,780
You,

6016
02:28:31,780 --> 02:28:32,270
you know,

6017
02:28:32,270 --> 02:28:33,440
on a peace keeping mission,

6018
02:28:33,620 --> 02:28:33,831
you know,

6019
02:28:33,831 --> 02:28:34,880
you're going to find Jesus.

6020
02:28:35,120 --> 02:28:35,451
He's a guy.

6021
02:28:35,451 --> 02:28:35,990
He's like,

6022
02:28:35,990 --> 02:28:36,291
he goes,

6023
02:28:36,291 --> 02:28:38,330
I'm either going to take your
money is what I did to my boys.

6024
02:28:38,331 --> 02:28:40,580
I'm gonna take your money or I'm
gonna Punch you in the stomach.

6025
02:28:40,610 --> 02:28:40,940
Right?

6026
02:28:40,940 --> 02:28:42,470
And we already got all our money stolen,

6027
02:28:42,471 --> 02:28:42,861
so we're like,

6028
02:28:42,861 --> 02:28:44,960
just punch in the stomach
to the sergeant punches.

6029
02:28:44,961 --> 02:28:45,800
Both from the stomach.

6030
02:28:46,450 --> 02:28:46,640
Yeah.

6031
02:28:46,640 --> 02:28:47,630
And then I'm like thinking to myself,

6032
02:28:47,780 --> 02:28:49,100
your money or punched in the stomach.

6033
02:28:49,101 --> 02:28:49,934
How much money?

6034
02:28:50,300 --> 02:28:50,750
I mean,

6035
02:28:50,750 --> 02:28:51,531
he punched all,

6036
02:28:51,531 --> 02:28:52,341
we didn't have any money on it,

6037
02:28:52,341 --> 02:28:53,174
so he just punched us.

6038
02:28:53,180 --> 02:28:54,140
That seems ridiculous.

6039
02:28:54,141 --> 02:28:54,411
That's what I,

6040
02:28:54,411 --> 02:28:55,460
that's how he treats his boys.

6041
02:28:55,461 --> 02:28:56,090
He said,

6042
02:28:56,090 --> 02:28:56,923
wait a minute.

6043
02:28:56,990 --> 02:28:58,460
He robs him or punches him.

6044
02:28:58,550 --> 02:28:59,530
He either.

6045
02:28:59,630 --> 02:29:00,463
Yeah,

6046
02:29:00,940 --> 02:29:03,140
that's benefiting him
in both circumstances.

6047
02:29:03,200 --> 02:29:04,370
So son of a bitch.

6048
02:29:04,400 --> 02:29:05,750
So action starts at home.

6049
02:29:06,400 --> 02:29:07,580
So the next thing I know,

6050
02:29:07,581 --> 02:29:08,420
I'm thinking of myself,

6051
02:29:08,421 --> 02:29:09,800
I'm in a bathroom and Djibouti,

6052
02:29:09,801 --> 02:29:11,930
Africa and I just got
punched in the stomach.

6053
02:29:11,960 --> 02:29:15,020
Like how many wrong turns in my life
do they make to get to this point?

6054
02:29:15,040 --> 02:29:15,260
You know,

6055
02:29:15,260 --> 02:29:16,010
that's a lot.

6056
02:29:16,010 --> 02:29:18,230
Did you just take it as a,

6057
02:29:18,590 --> 02:29:20,060
like an opportunity to work on your abs,

6058
02:29:21,200 --> 02:29:22,700
tighten up and let them blast away?

6059
02:29:22,760 --> 02:29:23,061
Go ahead,

6060
02:29:23,061 --> 02:29:23,820
bitch.

6061
02:29:23,820 --> 02:29:24,440
Adrenaline.

6062
02:29:24,440 --> 02:29:25,110
It didn't hurt,

6063
02:29:25,110 --> 02:29:25,880
you know,

6064
02:29:25,880 --> 02:29:26,780
Hook you in the liver.

6065
02:29:27,300 --> 02:29:28,370
It would been terrible.

6066
02:29:28,400 --> 02:29:29,233
Dirty bastard.

6067
02:29:29,330 --> 02:29:31,280
Did you let him make an
agreement where he was gonna hit?

6068
02:29:31,281 --> 02:29:32,180
You know,

6069
02:29:32,181 --> 02:29:35,180
he just punched in the stomach and
then that means you have a stomach.

6070
02:29:35,180 --> 02:29:37,640
Like what the ribs kind of,

6071
02:29:37,641 --> 02:29:39,140
but it wasn't a letter to this man.

6072
02:29:39,720 --> 02:29:41,000
I could throw a hook.

6073
02:29:41,030 --> 02:29:44,270
I can actually take a decent punch
like mayhem punched me like last week.

6074
02:29:44,440 --> 02:29:44,590
Yeah,

6075
02:29:44,590 --> 02:29:45,410
I heard about that.

6076
02:29:45,410 --> 02:29:46,243
What happened?

6077
02:29:46,250 --> 02:29:46,401
Well,

6078
02:29:46,401 --> 02:29:47,420
you know what don't say,

6079
02:29:47,630 --> 02:29:48,920
because then you can get sued.

6080
02:29:49,170 --> 02:29:49,670
Yeah.

6081
02:29:49,670 --> 02:29:52,790
I could give a bad interpretation because
I got a picture of a big lump on my

6082
02:29:52,791 --> 02:29:53,150
head.

6083
02:29:53,150 --> 02:29:54,350
It was an act could
have happened anywhere.

6084
02:29:54,351 --> 02:29:55,730
You could get hit in
the head with the media.

6085
02:29:55,820 --> 02:29:57,290
How do we know those
little shooting stars?

6086
02:29:57,300 --> 02:30:00,920
You see what if one burnt
out just as it hits you,

6087
02:30:00,921 --> 02:30:03,230
it just barely knocked you on
your ass and gave you a little,

6088
02:30:03,680 --> 02:30:04,410
that's a good point.

6089
02:30:04,410 --> 02:30:05,243
So that possible.

6090
02:30:05,390 --> 02:30:07,730
I want to know if anyone has ever
been hit in the head by a media.

6091
02:30:07,790 --> 02:30:10,820
I really would like to know because
I know they've landed in houses.

6092
02:30:11,750 --> 02:30:12,320
Wow.

6093
02:30:12,320 --> 02:30:14,060
That was anybody ever
been hit by a meteor.

6094
02:30:15,470 --> 02:30:16,303
Okay.

6095
02:30:16,470 --> 02:30:17,330
We gotta Google this.

6096
02:30:17,620 --> 02:30:18,020
Okay.

6097
02:30:18,020 --> 02:30:18,980
I'm saying yes,

6098
02:30:18,981 --> 02:30:19,341
Brian,

6099
02:30:19,341 --> 02:30:19,911
you're saying yes,

6100
02:30:19,911 --> 02:30:20,270
right?

6101
02:30:20,270 --> 02:30:20,691
Man,

6102
02:30:20,691 --> 02:30:22,610
hit by and they claim they have,

6103
02:30:22,611 --> 02:30:23,930
but how do you know
what actually hit them?

6104
02:30:23,960 --> 02:30:25,190
Because he doesn't have an army anymore.

6105
02:30:26,070 --> 02:30:28,190
What do you think I'm going
forward before I Google it.

6106
02:30:28,220 --> 02:30:28,680
Yes.

6107
02:30:28,680 --> 02:30:28,910
Yes.

6108
02:30:28,910 --> 02:30:29,450
It happened.

6109
02:30:29,450 --> 02:30:30,030
Yes.

6110
02:30:30,030 --> 02:30:30,950
I think it happens a lot.

6111
02:30:31,550 --> 02:30:32,450
Coroner's report,

6112
02:30:32,480 --> 02:30:33,960
man killed by media,

6113
02:30:33,961 --> 02:30:34,311
right?

6114
02:30:34,311 --> 02:30:35,144
That had

6115
02:30:36,440 --> 02:30:37,251
coroner's report,

6116
02:30:37,251 --> 02:30:38,340
man killed by media,

6117
02:30:38,341 --> 02:30:38,540
right.

6118
02:30:38,540 --> 02:30:39,950
Had marijuana in his system.

6119
02:30:40,220 --> 02:30:41,090
Oh my God.

6120
02:30:41,240 --> 02:30:42,200
So this dude,

6121
02:30:42,201 --> 02:30:43,130
he was killed.

6122
02:30:43,210 --> 02:30:43,611
Oh Wow.

6123
02:30:43,611 --> 02:30:45,200
This is like fairly recently.

6124
02:30:45,530 --> 02:30:48,720
This dude was killed by a fucking media.

6125
02:30:48,780 --> 02:30:53,620
He was high as shit and it was walking
through the town of San [inaudible],

6126
02:30:53,690 --> 02:30:54,620
California,

6127
02:30:55,040 --> 02:30:57,200
and he got hit by a media.

6128
02:30:57,201 --> 02:30:57,560
Right.

6129
02:30:57,560 --> 02:30:58,620
Some good weed right there.

6130
02:30:58,640 --> 02:31:00,740
That is unbelievable.

6131
02:31:01,700 --> 02:31:02,533
Yeah,

6132
02:31:03,170 --> 02:31:03,980
that sucks.

6133
02:31:03,980 --> 02:31:04,230
That's,

6134
02:31:04,230 --> 02:31:04,551
that's what,

6135
02:31:04,551 --> 02:31:05,001
that's what you know,

6136
02:31:05,001 --> 02:31:05,870
you're having a bad day.

6137
02:31:06,680 --> 02:31:07,490
You know,

6138
02:31:07,490 --> 02:31:08,390
like you have no luck.

6139
02:31:09,020 --> 02:31:09,890
God dammit.

6140
02:31:09,920 --> 02:31:13,640
I think this is a fucking
get hit by lightning twice.

6141
02:31:14,120 --> 02:31:19,120
There's been a guy out there that
parody God by lightning twice these of

6142
02:31:19,341 --> 02:31:20,174
bitches.

6143
02:31:20,480 --> 02:31:21,020
No,

6144
02:31:21,020 --> 02:31:21,860
this was a parody.

6145
02:31:22,220 --> 02:31:24,080
They wouldn't tell you if a
guy got killed by a media,

6146
02:31:24,081 --> 02:31:25,100
if he had patna system.

6147
02:31:26,000 --> 02:31:28,490
It's one of those silly websites
where they're trying to be cute.

6148
02:31:30,050 --> 02:31:30,291
Okay,

6149
02:31:30,291 --> 02:31:32,720
well this one is a guy who really
did get killed by a meteorite.

6150
02:31:32,900 --> 02:31:33,530
Wow.

6151
02:31:33,530 --> 02:31:34,760
This one's not funny at all.

6152
02:31:36,750 --> 02:31:37,583
Make it funny.

6153
02:31:37,770 --> 02:31:38,670
It's impossible,

6154
02:31:38,760 --> 02:31:39,091
but I mean,

6155
02:31:39,091 --> 02:31:41,400
I'm saying it's not a
funny store story at all.

6156
02:31:41,880 --> 02:31:42,210
Yeah.

6157
02:31:42,210 --> 02:31:43,500
There's a couple of
people that can hit this.

6158
02:31:43,501 --> 02:31:45,510
One woman had a big Gash on her arm,

6159
02:31:45,540 --> 02:31:46,440
but parents should live.

6160
02:31:46,441 --> 02:31:47,820
She got grazed by meeting.

6161
02:31:47,840 --> 02:31:48,120
Right,

6162
02:31:48,120 --> 02:31:49,440
which is even crazier.

6163
02:31:49,840 --> 02:31:50,673
Think of that.

6164
02:31:50,700 --> 02:31:55,700
A meteorite king from another planet
flew through our solar system,

6165
02:31:56,220 --> 02:31:58,050
penetrated our atmosphere,

6166
02:31:58,080 --> 02:31:59,580
and then hit her in the arm.

6167
02:31:59,760 --> 02:32:03,660
Almost just grazed her
gay read second Gash.

6168
02:32:03,720 --> 02:32:04,553
Wow.

6169
02:32:05,300 --> 02:32:05,700
Well,

6170
02:32:05,700 --> 02:32:06,241
here's another one.

6171
02:32:06,241 --> 02:32:08,460
A man was struck by one killed instantly.

6172
02:32:08,970 --> 02:32:09,600
Damn.

6173
02:32:09,600 --> 02:32:10,021
It appeared.

6174
02:32:10,021 --> 02:32:11,590
The media had come from a direction,

6175
02:32:11,591 --> 02:32:16,080
a little west or south of fellow
bleakly at an angle of about 60 degrees.

6176
02:32:16,680 --> 02:32:21,600
It passed through a fall maple cutting
the limbs as clean as if it been a cannon

6177
02:32:21,601 --> 02:32:26,601
ball and struck him apparently on or
under the shoulder passing through him.

6178
02:32:27,120 --> 02:32:30,690
Oh bleakly from below the right shoulder,

6179
02:32:30,691 --> 02:32:35,691
two above the left hip and buried
itself about two feet in the soft black

6180
02:32:36,931 --> 02:32:37,764
ground.

6181
02:32:38,010 --> 02:32:39,840
Mother fucker belt,

6182
02:32:39,841 --> 02:32:40,360
hard to sign.

6183
02:32:40,360 --> 02:32:45,360
So it came through his armpit and came
out his left hip and then went through

6184
02:32:45,601 --> 02:32:46,530
the ground.

6185
02:32:46,920 --> 02:32:48,780
Mother fucker.

6186
02:32:49,920 --> 02:32:54,920
What a shit he's a locked at is do you
imagine it went through a fucking tree,

6187
02:32:57,391 --> 02:33:00,720
like a cannon ball and
then through his body,

6188
02:33:01,680 --> 02:33:05,370
right armpit to left hip and
then two feet into the ground.

6189
02:33:05,880 --> 02:33:06,713
Shit.

6190
02:33:07,620 --> 02:33:12,620
All in one big burst of what the fuck
just happened and is a giant hole in your

6191
02:33:12,841 --> 02:33:14,130
chest and you think you've been,

6192
02:33:14,450 --> 02:33:15,060
you know,

6193
02:33:15,060 --> 02:33:17,010
probably hit by with a canon or something?

6194
02:33:17,011 --> 02:33:17,190
Yeah.

6195
02:33:17,190 --> 02:33:18,660
Or attacked by aliens,

6196
02:33:18,690 --> 02:33:19,150
you know,

6197
02:33:19,150 --> 02:33:22,230
Congo load or what the fuck man,

6198
02:33:23,990 --> 02:33:26,750
it's probably not a lot
of people and many times

6199
02:33:28,330 --> 02:33:29,410
popping out.

6200
02:33:29,420 --> 02:33:30,253
A lot of people.

6201
02:33:30,880 --> 02:33:31,461
I wonder,

6202
02:33:31,461 --> 02:33:32,030
you know,

6203
02:33:32,030 --> 02:33:32,151
Oh,

6204
02:33:32,151 --> 02:33:32,984
here's another one.

6205
02:33:33,080 --> 02:33:33,680
People start.

6206
02:33:33,680 --> 02:33:34,430
Oh Wow,

6207
02:33:34,430 --> 02:33:35,140
okay.

6208
02:33:35,140 --> 02:33:36,070
It actually a,

6209
02:33:36,130 --> 02:33:41,130
a website that tracks reported
deaths and injuries from media.

6210
02:33:41,301 --> 02:33:41,481
Right.

6211
02:33:41,481 --> 02:33:42,314
Impact.

6212
02:33:43,400 --> 02:33:47,870
And there they have them all the
way back to 1400 BC in Israel.

6213
02:33:48,380 --> 02:33:49,980
It's either always the Jews,

6214
02:33:50,520 --> 02:33:51,140
the Jews.

6215
02:33:51,140 --> 02:33:51,471
Yeah,

6216
02:33:51,471 --> 02:33:51,741
they were,

6217
02:33:51,741 --> 02:33:56,090
they were keeping track even back then
at dudes that got killed by media rights.

6218
02:33:56,330 --> 02:33:59,960
I wonder who has God killed any of
your children with media rights?

6219
02:34:00,200 --> 02:34:01,070
Call this number.

6220
02:34:01,071 --> 02:34:02,310
You may be entitled to Shit.

6221
02:34:05,480 --> 02:34:07,040
That's how they were keeping track.

6222
02:34:07,041 --> 02:34:07,551
One day.

6223
02:34:07,551 --> 02:34:08,390
I'll tell God,

6224
02:34:08,780 --> 02:34:10,190
you son of a bitch,

6225
02:34:10,910 --> 02:34:12,180
I lost my favorite son.

6226
02:34:12,181 --> 02:34:13,580
Do a fucking media right?

6227
02:34:13,610 --> 02:34:14,443
Gotta be,

6228
02:34:15,920 --> 02:34:16,753
yeah.

6229
02:34:16,930 --> 02:34:17,190
Yeah.

6230
02:34:17,190 --> 02:34:18,480
All the way back to 18,

6231
02:34:18,481 --> 02:34:19,740
25 India.

6232
02:34:19,770 --> 02:34:19,990
Yeah,

6233
02:34:19,990 --> 02:34:20,510
there's a,

6234
02:34:20,510 --> 02:34:21,360
there's a website.

6235
02:34:21,390 --> 02:34:22,223
Um,

6236
02:34:22,350 --> 02:34:22,620
um,

6237
02:34:22,620 --> 02:34:25,340
just Google it reported deaths and
injuries from media or any impact.

6238
02:34:25,341 --> 02:34:28,740
It's fascinating to think about how many
fucking people died throughout history.

6239
02:34:28,920 --> 02:34:32,820
But overall I would say it looks like
it's only like a hundred people throughout

6240
02:34:32,821 --> 02:34:33,660
recorded history.

6241
02:34:33,960 --> 02:34:34,920
Maybe less,

6242
02:34:35,280 --> 02:34:38,220
maybe less incredible man.

6243
02:34:39,030 --> 02:34:39,341
But the,

6244
02:34:39,341 --> 02:34:40,490
the really scary things.

6245
02:34:40,530 --> 02:34:41,161
How many media,

6246
02:34:41,161 --> 02:34:41,371
right?

6247
02:34:41,371 --> 02:34:42,031
Showers.

6248
02:34:42,031 --> 02:34:42,864
There have been,

6249
02:34:43,140 --> 02:34:43,711
one of them,

6250
02:34:43,711 --> 02:34:43,860
uh,

6251
02:34:43,860 --> 02:34:46,890
was reported in China in 14,

6252
02:34:46,891 --> 02:34:51,891
90 tens of thousands of people were killed
during a meteor shower in the Shensi

6253
02:34:52,651 --> 02:34:53,484
province.

6254
02:34:53,820 --> 02:34:54,960
Imagine that shit man.

6255
02:34:55,140 --> 02:34:59,370
Tens of thousands of people killed
by flying rocks from the sky.

6256
02:34:59,580 --> 02:35:03,140
Just all the sudden Dasia
rocks are commonsense.

6257
02:35:03,170 --> 02:35:04,770
Slamming your fucking family.

6258
02:35:06,840 --> 02:35:07,531
They said the,

6259
02:35:07,531 --> 02:35:08,364
uh,

6260
02:35:08,550 --> 02:35:09,510
the similarities,

6261
02:35:09,511 --> 02:35:10,344
uh,

6262
02:35:10,530 --> 02:35:11,090
that it was a,

6263
02:35:11,090 --> 02:35:14,070
like a similar type of impact to
where the tongue guscott event,

6264
02:35:15,710 --> 02:35:16,461
that's the one that,

6265
02:35:16,461 --> 02:35:17,030
uh,

6266
02:35:17,030 --> 02:35:22,030
I think it was somewhere in Siberia
flatten this huge area of forest that

6267
02:35:23,031 --> 02:35:25,430
apparently exploded on impact.

6268
02:35:25,431 --> 02:35:28,430
Like it came and as it was coming in,

6269
02:35:28,460 --> 02:35:33,460
like probably either exploded just
above the ground or close to the ground.

6270
02:35:34,070 --> 02:35:34,491
And,

6271
02:35:34,491 --> 02:35:34,641
uh,

6272
02:35:34,641 --> 02:35:35,600
just from the,

6273
02:35:35,601 --> 02:35:35,871
you know,

6274
02:35:35,871 --> 02:35:37,460
just broke apart because of the,

6275
02:35:37,461 --> 02:35:38,180
uh,

6276
02:35:38,180 --> 02:35:42,170
coming through and just leveled
thousands of miles of trees,

6277
02:35:42,380 --> 02:35:47,380
just a little leveled to
square miles gone of nothing.

6278
02:35:48,260 --> 02:35:48,621
You look at,

6279
02:35:48,621 --> 02:35:49,454
pull that up Brian.

6280
02:35:49,700 --> 02:35:52,040
Tongue goose GFE tongue Guscott event.

6281
02:35:53,020 --> 02:35:53,710
Cause uh,

6282
02:35:53,710 --> 02:35:54,400
yeah,

6283
02:35:54,400 --> 02:35:57,290
just to let us know that that
shit can happen at any time.

6284
02:35:57,291 --> 02:35:58,550
And this is something that happened.

6285
02:35:58,610 --> 02:35:59,510
I think it was the night,

6286
02:35:59,540 --> 02:36:01,580
I feel like the 1920s
or something like that.

6287
02:36:02,210 --> 02:36:06,380
But I mean that's like when we started
really writing these things down and

6288
02:36:06,381 --> 02:36:07,460
taking pictures of them.

6289
02:36:07,760 --> 02:36:08,510
You know,

6290
02:36:08,510 --> 02:36:11,180
a couple of hundred years
ago there was no cameras.

6291
02:36:11,180 --> 02:36:12,830
So when things like these happened,

6292
02:36:13,220 --> 02:36:14,090
you know there's your,

6293
02:36:14,091 --> 02:36:14,451
your,

6294
02:36:14,451 --> 02:36:17,990
your stories about it are limited to
just people telling you what happened.

6295
02:36:18,050 --> 02:36:18,980
I'm like rocks and stuff.

6296
02:36:18,981 --> 02:36:21,770
But this tongue goose go event was
very unique in the fact that you could

6297
02:36:21,771 --> 02:36:26,720
actually see what a forest looked like
before the impact and what it looked like

6298
02:36:26,721 --> 02:36:27,680
after the impact.

6299
02:36:27,920 --> 02:36:28,641
And he just go,

6300
02:36:28,641 --> 02:36:30,110
Whoa,

6301
02:36:30,680 --> 02:36:32,630
what the fuck?

6302
02:36:32,960 --> 02:36:36,290
And then you realize that was that
nothing ball that was nothing.

6303
02:36:36,590 --> 02:36:38,660
That shit didn't do anything that,

6304
02:36:38,780 --> 02:36:40,170
I mean compared to what the,

6305
02:36:40,171 --> 02:36:40,431
the,

6306
02:36:40,431 --> 02:36:42,800
the one that hit the Yucatan
and killed all the dinosaurs.

6307
02:36:42,801 --> 02:36:44,120
I fucking thing didn't do nothing.

6308
02:36:44,260 --> 02:36:44,750
Right.

6309
02:36:44,750 --> 02:36:47,750
But the photos of the devastation,

6310
02:36:47,751 --> 02:36:48,710
those upper left photos,

6311
02:36:48,711 --> 02:36:48,951
Brian,

6312
02:36:48,951 --> 02:36:49,850
cause they're all the,

6313
02:36:50,180 --> 02:36:53,300
they're all black and white because
it's the 1920s the upper left.

6314
02:36:53,890 --> 02:36:57,470
Is there anything with the college back
then go up the Oh you son of a bitch

6315
02:36:57,471 --> 02:36:58,310
cracking jokes.

6316
02:36:58,940 --> 02:36:59,480
That's what it,

6317
02:36:59,480 --> 02:37:01,720
that's what the forest looked
like after it was over.

6318
02:37:02,020 --> 02:37:02,900
Like look at that,

6319
02:37:03,890 --> 02:37:04,723
look at that photo.

6320
02:37:05,000 --> 02:37:09,550
Just flattened like matchsticks
the entire forest mean.

6321
02:37:10,010 --> 02:37:11,540
Wrap your head around that photo.

6322
02:37:11,750 --> 02:37:16,750
No one had ever seen anything like that
where there was just miles and miles and

6323
02:37:17,560 --> 02:37:20,860
miles and miles and miles of flat and
trees completely pinned down to the

6324
02:37:20,861 --> 02:37:21,520
ground.

6325
02:37:21,520 --> 02:37:22,353
Flattened

6326
02:37:24,910 --> 02:37:28,960
from space and there could be thousands
of those hitting it anytime you read to

6327
02:37:28,961 --> 02:37:30,040
your kids that like a night.

6328
02:37:30,340 --> 02:37:30,760
Yeah.

6329
02:37:30,760 --> 02:37:30,990
Yeah.

6330
02:37:30,990 --> 02:37:31,300
Story.

6331
02:37:31,300 --> 02:37:31,691
It can.

6332
02:37:31,691 --> 02:37:32,710
That is my favorite.

6333
02:37:32,800 --> 02:37:34,630
Really set the cat in the hat man.

6334
02:37:34,640 --> 02:37:35,830
There motherfucker got lazy.

6335
02:37:35,831 --> 02:37:36,460
You only wrote two

6336
02:37:36,460 --> 02:37:38,410
book of that.

6337
02:37:38,830 --> 02:37:39,250
You know,

6338
02:37:39,250 --> 02:37:41,660
you like act these out cause
you can sometimes look like,

6339
02:37:43,440 --> 02:37:44,600
well I've not tried to scare me.

6340
02:37:44,780 --> 02:37:45,613
Okay.

6341
02:37:48,570 --> 02:37:50,760
I'm not even trying to
scare me or scare you.

6342
02:37:50,761 --> 02:37:51,594
It's just to me,

6343
02:37:51,830 --> 02:37:52,710
I wonder if you animate them.

6344
02:37:52,740 --> 02:37:54,660
I think it's important to
talk about those things.

6345
02:37:54,690 --> 02:37:55,321
Absolutely.

6346
02:37:55,321 --> 02:37:55,651
Bring,

6347
02:37:55,651 --> 02:37:57,210
bring it up just every now and then.

6348
02:37:57,211 --> 02:37:58,230
Just let,

6349
02:37:58,680 --> 02:38:00,750
just get that fucking
thought in your head.

6350
02:38:00,780 --> 02:38:01,950
This is a possibility.

6351
02:38:02,280 --> 02:38:02,581
This,

6352
02:38:02,581 --> 02:38:02,881
this,

6353
02:38:02,881 --> 02:38:04,140
this life that we live,

6354
02:38:04,200 --> 02:38:04,650
it was,

6355
02:38:04,650 --> 02:38:06,500
which is so beautiful and uh,

6356
02:38:06,570 --> 02:38:11,570
so complicated and so well contained in
the civilized world that we have could

6357
02:38:11,851 --> 02:38:15,600
end the lingo that I know
one chunk of rock from space.

6358
02:38:15,840 --> 02:38:17,910
It's hard to live like that though
because then you end up spending all your

6359
02:38:17,911 --> 02:38:19,760
money and just making all of that,

6360
02:38:19,800 --> 02:38:20,311
I'm serious.

6361
02:38:20,311 --> 02:38:21,111
I can make a decision.

6362
02:38:21,111 --> 02:38:22,170
Is that like fuck it,

6363
02:38:22,171 --> 02:38:22,760
we're going to do that.

6364
02:38:22,760 --> 02:38:23,330
Like,

6365
02:38:23,330 --> 02:38:24,990
like I was thinking if
I had a week to live,

6366
02:38:24,991 --> 02:38:25,824
right.

6367
02:38:25,860 --> 02:38:27,300
Would I be honest like,

6368
02:38:27,340 --> 02:38:30,210
like about how much there
cause that certain people I
don't like or I don't like

6369
02:38:30,211 --> 02:38:31,050
what they're doing or well,

6370
02:38:31,051 --> 02:38:32,820
even in this world or that world,

6371
02:38:32,821 --> 02:38:33,011
but don't,

6372
02:38:33,011 --> 02:38:36,450
I don't say it because I'd be a bad career
choice or something or I'm wondering

6373
02:38:36,451 --> 02:38:37,211
if I had a week to live,

6374
02:38:37,211 --> 02:38:37,751
if I would say it,

6375
02:38:37,751 --> 02:38:39,210
probably not because I
wouldn't want to be a dick,

6376
02:38:39,540 --> 02:38:39,950
but I,

6377
02:38:39,950 --> 02:38:40,880
well if you don't want to be a dick,

6378
02:38:40,881 --> 02:38:41,391
don't be a dick.

6379
02:38:41,391 --> 02:38:43,520
It doesn't matter if there's
a week to go or an hour ago,

6380
02:38:43,580 --> 02:38:44,413
just don't be a dick.

6381
02:38:44,780 --> 02:38:45,291
You can,

6382
02:38:45,291 --> 02:38:46,470
you know you,

6383
02:38:47,150 --> 02:38:48,500
it's a focus exercise.

6384
02:38:48,501 --> 02:38:51,890
I think whenever there's someone that's
distracting you and someone that saw

6385
02:38:51,891 --> 02:38:52,071
that,

6386
02:38:52,071 --> 02:38:54,860
you're concentrating on them for no reason
when they're really not have anything

6387
02:38:54,861 --> 02:38:59,020
to do with you unless they're
affecting your business or affecting,

6388
02:38:59,021 --> 02:38:59,420
you know,

6389
02:38:59,420 --> 02:39:01,520
the way you operate in your life.

6390
02:39:01,800 --> 02:39:03,950
If it's just you fixating on them,

6391
02:39:04,190 --> 02:39:05,790
just use it as a focus exercise.

6392
02:39:05,791 --> 02:39:06,201
Just say,

6393
02:39:06,201 --> 02:39:06,860
you know what?

6394
02:39:06,860 --> 02:39:08,840
This is obviously a test.

6395
02:39:08,930 --> 02:39:13,460
What advice would I give someone like me
if I was in this situation to give them

6396
02:39:13,461 --> 02:39:14,060
advice?

6397
02:39:14,060 --> 02:39:14,421
I would say,

6398
02:39:14,421 --> 02:39:14,571
well,

6399
02:39:14,571 --> 02:39:15,530
this is what you don't do.

6400
02:39:15,710 --> 02:39:17,600
Don't focus on that because
there's no benefited.

6401
02:39:17,630 --> 02:39:20,570
I know you can hate the guy unless
you got some material out of it.

6402
02:39:20,600 --> 02:39:22,260
Unless there's something
really funny about it

6403
02:39:22,390 --> 02:39:23,020
in a cup up.

6404
02:39:23,020 --> 02:39:24,580
For me being a comic sometimes is that,

6405
02:39:24,820 --> 02:39:29,200
is that those positive workshops don't
work for comedy because I think I'm a lot

6406
02:39:29,201 --> 02:39:30,860
funnier if I'm being negative like that.

6407
02:39:31,230 --> 02:39:32,440
It's focused negativity,

6408
02:39:32,600 --> 02:39:32,961
but it's,

6409
02:39:32,961 --> 02:39:33,750
but it's negative.

6410
02:39:33,750 --> 02:39:34,021
You know?

6411
02:39:34,021 --> 02:39:35,140
It's negative jokes.

6412
02:39:35,150 --> 02:39:36,060
It says positive but,

6413
02:39:36,390 --> 02:39:39,130
but if I start looking at
everything in a positive way,

6414
02:39:39,160 --> 02:39:43,460
I think my humor and relating to
people is going to go out the window.

6415
02:39:43,710 --> 02:39:44,071
Well,

6416
02:39:44,071 --> 02:39:44,350
um,

6417
02:39:44,350 --> 02:39:46,410
it will change it a morph a little bit,

6418
02:39:46,470 --> 02:39:46,980
you know?

6419
02:39:46,980 --> 02:39:47,310
Um,

6420
02:39:47,310 --> 02:39:51,090
but it's still possible to be really
funny and to really be really be positive.

6421
02:39:51,091 --> 02:39:52,410
It would just be a
different kind of funny.

6422
02:39:52,650 --> 02:39:55,200
I think that you're a funny guy
and I think if you're a funny guy,

6423
02:39:55,201 --> 02:39:56,340
you know how to be funny,

6424
02:39:56,580 --> 02:39:57,061
you know what I mean?

6425
02:39:57,061 --> 02:39:57,530
You know,

6426
02:39:57,530 --> 02:39:58,050
do you know?

6427
02:39:58,050 --> 02:39:58,883
Thank you sweetie.

6428
02:39:59,260 --> 02:39:59,490
Uh,

6429
02:39:59,490 --> 02:40:00,061
you know what I mean?

6430
02:40:00,061 --> 02:40:00,810
You know how to do it.

6431
02:40:00,810 --> 02:40:03,690
I think you would be able to do it in
any way you'd do it and what it should

6432
02:40:03,691 --> 02:40:05,430
represent is who you really are.

6433
02:40:05,580 --> 02:40:07,590
So if occasionally it's mean,

6434
02:40:07,950 --> 02:40:11,220
cause occasionally you're mean and the
of these mean thoughts and they're funny,

6435
02:40:11,340 --> 02:40:12,420
then you should fucking go with it.

6436
02:40:12,421 --> 02:40:12,630
That's

6437
02:40:12,630 --> 02:40:13,381
most of jokes.

6438
02:40:13,381 --> 02:40:14,030
I mean honestly

6439
02:40:14,030 --> 02:40:14,863
I'm a,

6440
02:40:14,970 --> 02:40:17,460
I wouldn't say mean spirited comment
cause I don't like to go like,

6441
02:40:17,640 --> 02:40:18,420
oh hope you die of aids.

6442
02:40:18,420 --> 02:40:18,560
You know,

6443
02:40:18,560 --> 02:40:18,820
there's,

6444
02:40:18,820 --> 02:40:20,130
there's like shock humor.

6445
02:40:20,220 --> 02:40:20,370
Yeah.

6446
02:40:20,370 --> 02:40:21,680
Where it's just what you say.

6447
02:40:21,930 --> 02:40:23,070
I hope you die in a car accident.

6448
02:40:24,570 --> 02:40:24,751
No,

6449
02:40:24,751 --> 02:40:27,150
I don't think I would because I wouldn't
want that person to die in the car

6450
02:40:27,151 --> 02:40:28,600
accident here that when he says no,

6451
02:40:28,601 --> 02:40:29,320
no,

6452
02:40:29,320 --> 02:40:29,580
no,

6453
02:40:29,580 --> 02:40:30,520
he would never say that.

6454
02:40:30,690 --> 02:40:31,930
I don't know if I would say that.

6455
02:40:32,130 --> 02:40:32,650
I probably,

6456
02:40:32,650 --> 02:40:33,011
I,

6457
02:40:33,011 --> 02:40:33,250
you know,

6458
02:40:33,250 --> 02:40:33,570
I,

6459
02:40:33,570 --> 02:40:35,250
I've gone and been on stage and
someone heckled and I'm like,

6460
02:40:35,280 --> 02:40:36,720
this is why I'm a pro choice,

6461
02:40:36,750 --> 02:40:37,110
you know?

6462
02:40:37,110 --> 02:40:39,510
Or something like that
right now where I'm like,

6463
02:40:40,140 --> 02:40:42,510
but I don't know if I would
ever like work that into like,

6464
02:40:42,540 --> 02:40:43,490
there's some comics they're like,

6465
02:40:43,500 --> 02:40:43,660
oh,

6466
02:40:43,660 --> 02:40:44,493
Justin Bieber dies.

6467
02:40:44,520 --> 02:40:45,353
I would never,

6468
02:40:45,450 --> 02:40:45,960
but I know it.

6469
02:40:45,960 --> 02:40:46,710
I know what you're saying.

6470
02:40:46,710 --> 02:40:47,071
It's like,

6471
02:40:47,071 --> 02:40:47,460
um,

6472
02:40:47,460 --> 02:40:48,900
as you trying to get older,

6473
02:40:48,901 --> 02:40:53,901
like as you're a wiser person to smart
inclination is to sort of go towards like

6474
02:40:54,781 --> 02:40:57,090
less altercations in your life.

6475
02:40:57,120 --> 02:40:58,170
Last bullshit.

6476
02:40:58,200 --> 02:40:59,033
Less hassle,

6477
02:40:59,250 --> 02:41:00,390
less people upset at you,

6478
02:41:00,780 --> 02:41:01,141
you know?

6479
02:41:01,141 --> 02:41:04,680
And it's kind of hard to do that when
you're a comedian because you have to make

6480
02:41:04,681 --> 02:41:05,580
fun of some idiots.

6481
02:41:05,880 --> 02:41:07,080
You'd have to make fun of dummies.

6482
02:41:07,110 --> 02:41:07,580
You see him,

6483
02:41:07,580 --> 02:41:07,801
you're like,

6484
02:41:07,801 --> 02:41:07,970
who?

6485
02:41:07,970 --> 02:41:08,730
This silly period.

6486
02:41:08,730 --> 02:41:09,290
You also,

6487
02:41:09,290 --> 02:41:12,270
I think have to look at the
cynical part of things I do.

6488
02:41:12,900 --> 02:41:13,740
Other people don't have to,

6489
02:41:13,741 --> 02:41:15,180
but I have to look at too,

6490
02:41:15,300 --> 02:41:15,841
we should,

6491
02:41:15,841 --> 02:41:16,361
we all we,

6492
02:41:16,361 --> 02:41:17,011
it was socially,

6493
02:41:17,011 --> 02:41:20,910
we all like have an obligation to sort
of monitor our surroundings and to keep

6494
02:41:20,911 --> 02:41:21,990
things from getting out of hand,

6495
02:41:22,350 --> 02:41:24,030
keep pet rocks from rising again.

6496
02:41:24,260 --> 02:41:28,050
But every now and then there's some shit
that as a comedian like your job really

6497
02:41:28,051 --> 02:41:31,170
truly is to make fun of these things
because they are ridiculous and we're all

6498
02:41:31,171 --> 02:41:34,380
going to figure out their ridiculous in
time with or without comedians like bell

6499
02:41:34,381 --> 02:41:34,801
bottoms,

6500
02:41:34,801 --> 02:41:35,410
they just did.

6501
02:41:35,410 --> 02:41:36,151
Eventually we go,

6502
02:41:36,151 --> 02:41:36,421
no,

6503
02:41:36,421 --> 02:41:37,254
stop it.

6504
02:41:37,560 --> 02:41:42,450
But comedians like that's sort of like
the role that a comic plays other than

6505
02:41:42,451 --> 02:41:45,840
entertainment in society is to point
out these things and to say like,

6506
02:41:45,841 --> 02:41:46,320
look,

6507
02:41:46,320 --> 02:41:47,153
come on.

6508
02:41:47,250 --> 02:41:48,300
This is ridiculous.

6509
02:41:48,301 --> 02:41:50,560
Like there's just too
many holes in this idea.

6510
02:41:50,561 --> 02:41:52,880
I'll give you some,

6511
02:41:52,970 --> 02:41:53,803
sometimes it's Wayne,

6512
02:41:54,250 --> 02:41:54,790
you know,

6513
02:41:54,790 --> 02:41:55,181
like let,

6514
02:41:55,181 --> 02:41:56,650
let's take NMA roasted for an example.

6515
02:41:56,651 --> 02:41:57,310
Like last night,

6516
02:41:57,310 --> 02:42:00,490
Notre Dame was w with that
losing like 35 to nothing.

6517
02:42:00,530 --> 02:42:01,090
Right.

6518
02:42:01,090 --> 02:42:03,140
And I said Cecil People's
had Notre Dame winning know.

6519
02:42:03,310 --> 02:42:03,611
Right.

6520
02:42:03,611 --> 02:42:04,181
So that's like,

6521
02:42:04,181 --> 02:42:04,720
okay,

6522
02:42:04,720 --> 02:42:05,350
ah,

6523
02:42:05,350 --> 02:42:05,980
that's not,

6524
02:42:05,980 --> 02:42:06,340
that's not,

6525
02:42:06,340 --> 02:42:06,961
it's a funny joke,

6526
02:42:06,961 --> 02:42:08,030
but I love those jokes.

6527
02:42:08,690 --> 02:42:09,640
I love Csun people.

6528
02:42:10,180 --> 02:42:10,780
But then,

6529
02:42:10,780 --> 02:42:11,590
but then there's like,

6530
02:42:11,590 --> 02:42:11,981
okay,

6531
02:42:11,981 --> 02:42:12,281
your,

6532
02:42:12,281 --> 02:42:12,461
your,

6533
02:42:12,461 --> 02:42:12,611
your,

6534
02:42:12,611 --> 02:42:13,720
your colleague Goldberg.

6535
02:42:13,780 --> 02:42:14,021
Okay.

6536
02:42:14,021 --> 02:42:16,180
Was accused not thing allegedly
doing something right.

6537
02:42:16,990 --> 02:42:18,670
And it's on the MMA websites,

6538
02:42:18,810 --> 02:42:20,470
so it's not like I'm making this shit up.

6539
02:42:20,500 --> 02:42:21,430
It's on the underground.

6540
02:42:21,431 --> 02:42:22,090
It's on,

6541
02:42:22,090 --> 02:42:22,480
you know,

6542
02:42:22,480 --> 02:42:22,631
I mean,

6543
02:42:22,631 --> 02:42:23,081
maybe weekly,

6544
02:42:23,081 --> 02:42:23,914
I'm a junkie,

6545
02:42:24,010 --> 02:42:27,340
but I don't want to piss off this guy
because he's a nice guy and he seems like

6546
02:42:27,350 --> 02:42:28,183
he's,

6547
02:42:28,300 --> 02:42:29,470
if it is something serious,

6548
02:42:29,471 --> 02:42:31,210
you don't want to be a total dick to him.

6549
02:42:31,480 --> 02:42:34,360
So I try to use like Goldberg
was hopped on upper as well,

6550
02:42:34,361 --> 02:42:35,350
watching John Fitch fight,

6551
02:42:35,700 --> 02:42:36,090
you know,

6552
02:42:36,090 --> 02:42:38,200
so therefore the job
becomes about John Fitch.

6553
02:42:38,590 --> 02:42:40,000
It's still mentioned that,

6554
02:42:40,520 --> 02:42:40,840
you know,

6555
02:42:40,840 --> 02:42:43,930
still mentioning then still
mentioning the unmentionable.

6556
02:42:44,400 --> 02:42:44,681
Right.

6557
02:42:44,681 --> 02:42:45,430
So then it's like,

6558
02:42:45,430 --> 02:42:46,000
okay,

6559
02:42:46,000 --> 02:42:47,110
now I'm able to do that.

6560
02:42:47,111 --> 02:42:48,790
But there's only so many
times you can do that.

6561
02:42:48,950 --> 02:42:49,530
Right.

6562
02:42:49,530 --> 02:42:53,070
I've seen people say like a Joe Rogan
and a coke rage in the middle of a fight.

6563
02:42:53,280 --> 02:42:55,380
The reality is I've
never tried cocaine once.

6564
02:42:55,470 --> 02:42:56,303
I've never done it.

6565
02:42:56,370 --> 02:42:58,710
So I mean you can never
say you see me coked up.

6566
02:42:58,740 --> 02:42:59,880
I've never been coked up.

6567
02:42:59,940 --> 02:43:02,190
I wrote Joe Rogan's head just
exploded during the break.

6568
02:43:02,940 --> 02:43:03,773
That's,

6569
02:43:03,860 --> 02:43:04,693
that's not,

6570
02:43:04,710 --> 02:43:05,390
it's,

6571
02:43:05,390 --> 02:43:05,850
you know,

6572
02:43:05,850 --> 02:43:08,100
I know it sounds ridiculous,

6573
02:43:08,101 --> 02:43:11,700
but I've literally never
even thought about cocaine.

6574
02:43:11,820 --> 02:43:12,690
I really have never,

6575
02:43:12,900 --> 02:43:13,410
I just,

6576
02:43:13,410 --> 02:43:16,650
I grew up around people that fuck
their entire life up with it.

6577
02:43:16,980 --> 02:43:19,440
And the last thing I ever
needed was like a stimulant.

6578
02:43:19,770 --> 02:43:22,680
I wanted something that would kind
of center me and calm me down.

6579
02:43:22,681 --> 02:43:23,310
And when one,

6580
02:43:23,310 --> 02:43:23,940
that's one of the,

6581
02:43:23,940 --> 02:43:24,450
the,

6582
02:43:24,450 --> 02:43:25,800
when I found pawn I was like,

6583
02:43:26,010 --> 02:43:27,750
cause the drink would
relax me a little bit,

6584
02:43:27,751 --> 02:43:30,150
but a drink would also get
me riled up in a bad way.

6585
02:43:30,510 --> 02:43:32,820
Whereas pot like sorta
would put me in like a,

6586
02:43:33,600 --> 02:43:34,433
yeah,

6587
02:43:34,640 --> 02:43:34,950
right.

6588
02:43:34,950 --> 02:43:35,880
I could chill.

6589
02:43:35,881 --> 02:43:36,181
I could,

6590
02:43:36,181 --> 02:43:36,510
I could.

6591
02:43:36,510 --> 02:43:37,800
The last thing I wanted to be like,

6592
02:43:39,190 --> 02:43:39,510
no,

6593
02:43:39,510 --> 02:43:39,901
I did it.

6594
02:43:39,901 --> 02:43:42,180
I did it like three times a
once off a stripper's tits.

6595
02:43:42,240 --> 02:43:43,073
Cause she was like,

6596
02:43:43,350 --> 02:43:43,921
you want to fuck?

6597
02:43:43,921 --> 02:43:44,310
I said,

6598
02:43:44,310 --> 02:43:44,720
sure,

6599
02:43:44,720 --> 02:43:46,170
let's do a line of coke off my tits.

6600
02:43:46,200 --> 02:43:47,033
I'm like,

6601
02:43:47,280 --> 02:43:47,911
I'm going to do it.

6602
02:43:47,911 --> 02:43:48,690
I might as well.

6603
02:43:48,690 --> 02:43:49,680
That's the time to do it,

6604
02:43:49,681 --> 02:43:49,980
you know?

6605
02:43:49,980 --> 02:43:51,210
And then I had a girl do it off my,

6606
02:43:51,240 --> 02:43:52,110
well my dick one time.

6607
02:43:52,170 --> 02:43:53,160
Well that was pretty,

6608
02:43:53,161 --> 02:43:53,550
it was too,

6609
02:43:53,550 --> 02:43:54,570
I was hooking up with two checks.

6610
02:43:54,610 --> 02:43:55,680
One of them was not hot,

6611
02:43:55,980 --> 02:43:56,850
the other one was hot,

6612
02:43:56,880 --> 02:43:57,510
but it's the kind of,

6613
02:43:57,510 --> 02:43:58,530
I wanted a threesome.

6614
02:43:58,560 --> 02:43:58,821
Right,

6615
02:43:58,821 --> 02:43:59,220
right.

6616
02:43:59,220 --> 02:44:01,140
So the girl looks at my
penis as a line of coke,

6617
02:44:01,141 --> 02:44:02,040
which she like looks at me.

6618
02:44:02,041 --> 02:44:02,640
She was,

6619
02:44:02,640 --> 02:44:04,170
we're never going to have a relationship.

6620
02:44:07,500 --> 02:44:08,790
Well did she stood her ground.

6621
02:44:10,320 --> 02:44:11,730
She's got her morals.

6622
02:44:12,300 --> 02:44:12,690
She's,

6623
02:44:12,690 --> 02:44:15,150
she's not going to pick a guy
like you be willing to do this.

6624
02:44:15,180 --> 02:44:16,500
Let her snort coke off your Dick.

6625
02:44:16,501 --> 02:44:17,334
How dare you,

6626
02:44:17,450 --> 02:44:19,260
like she said then I like
the way you described it,

6627
02:44:19,261 --> 02:44:20,550
like a casting judgment on,

6628
02:44:20,551 --> 02:44:22,450
you're never going to have a relationship.

6629
02:44:22,920 --> 02:44:24,030
I can't even believe you're here.

6630
02:44:24,180 --> 02:44:25,860
I can't believe I'm about
to do coke off your Dick.

6631
02:44:25,920 --> 02:44:27,000
But some women's morals,

6632
02:44:27,001 --> 02:44:30,120
like I wasn't kidding threesome
encounter one time and I was like,

6633
02:44:30,360 --> 02:44:32,860
some girl was sitting on my face and
other kid was like blowing in the,

6634
02:44:33,020 --> 02:44:33,853
and he goes,

6635
02:44:33,990 --> 02:44:34,290
ah,

6636
02:44:34,290 --> 02:44:35,460
at least I don't cheat on my boyfriend.

6637
02:44:35,461 --> 02:44:36,090
And blew me.

6638
02:44:36,090 --> 02:44:37,320
Like she thought that wasn't cheating.

6639
02:44:37,410 --> 02:44:38,720
Like she really was almost like,

6640
02:44:39,360 --> 02:44:39,781
I was like,

6641
02:44:39,781 --> 02:44:40,320
dude,

6642
02:44:40,320 --> 02:44:40,890
I didn't want to be like,

6643
02:44:40,890 --> 02:44:41,400
you know,

6644
02:44:41,400 --> 02:44:42,233
listen,

6645
02:44:42,540 --> 02:44:43,373
you are cheating.

6646
02:44:44,310 --> 02:44:45,150
Don't stop it.

6647
02:44:45,210 --> 02:44:46,200
They don't want to cock block.

6648
02:44:46,201 --> 02:44:46,531
You'd be like,

6649
02:44:46,531 --> 02:44:46,980
yeah,

6650
02:44:46,980 --> 02:44:47,490
I hear Ya.

6651
02:44:47,490 --> 02:44:48,120
Yeah.

6652
02:44:48,120 --> 02:44:49,050
That was not the time.

6653
02:44:49,051 --> 02:44:50,910
Blow jobs are so not cheating.

6654
02:44:51,150 --> 02:44:51,440
Yes.

6655
02:44:51,440 --> 02:44:51,840
What,

6656
02:44:51,840 --> 02:44:55,680
what are you going to the
things that people do breeding,

6657
02:44:57,290 --> 02:44:58,123
breeding,

6658
02:44:58,130 --> 02:44:58,963
shoot loads.

6659
02:44:59,030 --> 02:44:59,121
Oh,

6660
02:44:59,121 --> 02:44:59,960
that's the 10 minute mark.

6661
02:45:00,260 --> 02:45:00,770
Um,

6662
02:45:00,770 --> 02:45:05,090
does anybody have anything to contribute
before we wrap this bitch up and bring

6663
02:45:05,091 --> 02:45:05,840
it home?

6664
02:45:05,840 --> 02:45:06,201
Brian,

6665
02:45:06,201 --> 02:45:06,891
anything going on?

6666
02:45:06,891 --> 02:45:09,050
He said this Friday you got to a show?

6667
02:45:09,080 --> 02:45:09,410
No,

6668
02:45:09,410 --> 02:45:09,741
no.

6669
02:45:09,741 --> 02:45:09,950
Uh,

6672
02:45:16,370 --> 02:45:17,750
it's a part of your AVN pass,

6673
02:45:17,751 --> 02:45:18,320
I believe.

6674
02:45:18,320 --> 02:45:19,131
And it's going to be me,

6675
02:45:19,131 --> 02:45:19,761
Doug Benson,

6676
02:45:19,761 --> 02:45:20,541
Sam Tripoli.

6677
02:45:20,541 --> 02:45:21,440
And a couple of other people.

6678
02:45:21,510 --> 02:45:22,010
Boom.

6679
02:45:22,010 --> 02:45:22,551
There it is.

6680
02:45:22,551 --> 02:45:23,384
Suck it.

6681
02:45:23,690 --> 02:45:24,201
And uh,

6682
02:45:24,201 --> 02:45:25,034
this Friday,

6683
02:45:25,250 --> 02:45:27,830
two shows at the Ice House in Pasadena,

6684
02:45:27,860 --> 02:45:29,330
eight 30 and 10 30.

6685
02:45:29,660 --> 02:45:30,320
It's a,

6686
02:45:30,320 --> 02:45:34,580
me and Ari should fear and
probably a couple other people.

6687
02:45:34,740 --> 02:45:35,660
I'll see how we do it,

6688
02:45:35,661 --> 02:45:37,730
but I'm trying to work out some new shit.

6689
02:45:37,731 --> 02:45:38,510
Yo,

6690
02:45:38,510 --> 02:45:38,871
you know,

6691
02:45:38,871 --> 02:45:39,740
I'm doing it right.

6692
02:45:39,741 --> 02:45:40,610
And I kind of went that way.

6693
02:45:40,660 --> 02:45:40,851
New,

6694
02:45:40,851 --> 02:45:43,010
mid to every yo all the time.

6695
02:45:43,040 --> 02:45:45,710
Everyday I'm hustling everyday.

6696
02:45:45,711 --> 02:45:46,760
I'm hustling.

6697
02:45:47,390 --> 02:45:48,230
You're hustling to,

6698
02:45:48,260 --> 02:45:49,190
and I appreciate that about you,

6699
02:45:49,191 --> 02:45:49,440
man.

6700
02:45:49,440 --> 02:45:50,390
That's one of the things I loved.

6701
02:45:50,690 --> 02:45:54,110
I loved when I came here and you showed
me that big file of all the things

6702
02:45:54,111 --> 02:45:54,650
you've written,

6703
02:45:54,650 --> 02:45:56,050
50 pages of the NNA jokes,

6704
02:45:56,120 --> 02:45:57,500
young comedians.

6705
02:45:57,501 --> 02:45:57,860
If this,

6706
02:45:57,860 --> 02:46:00,560
any fucking advice that
anybody should ever give you.

6707
02:46:00,561 --> 02:46:02,300
It's the advice that you got.

6708
02:46:02,301 --> 02:46:05,840
Put Your fucking head down and start
writing Brian Cowen and told you exactly

6709
02:46:05,841 --> 02:46:06,500
the right thing to do.

6710
02:46:06,500 --> 02:46:07,670
Just keep writing.

6711
02:46:07,671 --> 02:46:09,810
Just keep writing and keep and keep,

6712
02:46:09,830 --> 02:46:10,210
uh,

6713
02:46:10,210 --> 02:46:11,510
keep fucking throwing them out there.

6714
02:46:11,750 --> 02:46:12,230
Yeah,

6715
02:46:12,230 --> 02:46:13,100
it'd be nice to Brittany.

6716
02:46:13,101 --> 02:46:13,934
She's a nice person.

6717
02:46:14,110 --> 02:46:14,790
I'm mad.

6718
02:46:14,790 --> 02:46:15,191
I see.

6719
02:46:15,191 --> 02:46:16,080
Isn't that creamy?

6720
02:46:16,140 --> 02:46:17,900
You big meaning man,

6721
02:46:18,290 --> 02:46:21,410
every day I'm hustling
Adam comedian on Twitter,

6722
02:46:21,411 --> 02:46:22,250
but his other one,

6723
02:46:22,251 --> 02:46:26,390
MMA roasted on Twitter is actually more
popular than the actual human being

6724
02:46:26,391 --> 02:46:27,620
himself,

6725
02:46:27,680 --> 02:46:29,060
which is kind of weird and sad.

6726
02:46:29,120 --> 02:46:32,750
You should combine those two and then
no one would ever retweet your shit

6727
02:46:32,780 --> 02:46:35,030
because then you'd be
fucking Adam comedian,

6728
02:46:35,031 --> 02:46:37,820
MMA roasting the terrible
to have them all in one.

6729
02:46:38,080 --> 02:46:38,270
Yeah.

6730
02:46:38,270 --> 02:46:40,700
Everything you would say you would
limit yourself to like 60 characters.

6731
02:46:40,730 --> 02:46:40,821
Hey,

6732
02:46:40,821 --> 02:46:41,800
thank you so much for how,

6733
02:46:41,820 --> 02:46:42,680
thanks for being on man.

6734
02:46:42,681 --> 02:46:43,130
Anytime.

6735
02:46:43,130 --> 02:46:43,940
We'll do it again.

6736
02:46:43,940 --> 02:46:44,810
We'll do it again for sure.

6737
02:46:44,811 --> 02:46:45,441
In the meantime,

6738
02:46:45,441 --> 02:46:48,200
I want you to calm the fuck
down and take a yoga class.

6739
02:46:48,640 --> 02:46:49,220
No,

6740
02:46:49,220 --> 02:46:49,820
that's true.

6741
02:46:49,820 --> 02:46:50,610
That's very true.

6742
02:46:50,610 --> 02:46:51,441
You're good dude man.

6743
02:46:51,441 --> 02:46:51,891
And uh,

6744
02:46:51,891 --> 02:46:53,060
I wish you well and uh,

6745
02:46:53,061 --> 02:46:55,290
I think you've got a bright future
in this crazy standup business.

6746
02:46:55,310 --> 02:46:55,630
Thank you.

6747

I'm going to pick up one of those.

6764
02:47:25,881 --> 02:47:27,170
I can't live with it any longer.

6765
02:47:27,171 --> 02:47:29,900
I have too much envy for that big screen.

6766
02:47:30,020 --> 02:47:31,060
