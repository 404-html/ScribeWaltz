1
00:00:04,320 --> 00:00:05,153
That's fresh.

2
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:09,490
Yes, we're live. Ladies and gentlemen,

3
00:00:10,180 --> 00:00:12,190
we're live and we're here to
talk about Brendan Schaub shoes.

4
00:00:13,780 --> 00:00:17,080
Those fucking shoes that you wore
to the Mayweather. Mcgregor fight.

5
00:00:17,081 --> 00:00:21,510
What in the fuck you bought? Those are
they, someone gave new and some opinion.

6
00:00:21,550 --> 00:00:25,080
Aware. Yeah. Fill me duties. Paying
me like Jared Leto sense what?

7
00:00:25,090 --> 00:00:28,240
Brian sent you a video of him. I was
like, Oh God, he's going to judge me.

8
00:00:29,100 --> 00:00:32,530
He's going to judge me so hard and it's
part of you though. I like it, man.

9
00:00:33,610 --> 00:00:35,710
Fanny pack.
I got to shut the fuck up no matter any,

10
00:00:35,740 --> 00:00:38,500
any time where there's any
sort of fashion discussion.

11
00:00:38,860 --> 00:00:41,770
I just got to shut the fuck on. He
backs make sense though. The only,

12
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:46,800
the only tap shoes you are you like a
handmade from from Britain are delicious.

13
00:00:51,380 --> 00:00:54,910
Lots of black hole. What the fuck is
that about? Game of Thrones shits.

14
00:00:54,910 --> 00:00:58,900
I'm Khaleesi buckle that. I just can't
get a number. What's the beat and the bag?

15
00:00:58,901 --> 00:01:03,350
Is that a B? It's a gold be sun.
I get more cots. Gold? Yeah.

16
00:01:03,380 --> 00:01:06,760
Is this like one of those that black or
blue dress thing or it just looks weird

17
00:01:06,860 --> 00:01:10,180
picture. I get more compliments on
the shoes then any shoe I've ever had.

18
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:12,410
And then hold on. Mr. Ryan, you,

19
00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:17,510
you're six foot four gorilla scared of
no j Lo I saw Jayla she goes up your

20
00:01:17,781 --> 00:01:19,990
shoes. She goes, I love your
shoes. I want, she does.

21
00:01:20,050 --> 00:01:25,050
She's a check the check station code
sign while she's probably also trying to

22
00:01:25,511 --> 00:01:28,500
make a rod jealous cause they probably
been together long enough where she's

23
00:01:28,501 --> 00:01:30,010
starting to feel bored. Yeah, he,

24
00:01:30,011 --> 00:01:33,980
Raj was just trying to basic
the crackle going Jamie,

25
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:38,440
does that look like gold to you or am
I going blind? That's a gold beach.

26
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:42,970
Go, go back up to that. Let's go ahead
and see that the bucket was like silver.

27
00:01:43,060 --> 00:01:47,720
Yeah, I guess so. Go Lock.
Make it larger on that.

28
00:01:48,550 --> 00:01:49,383
Oh is it?

29
00:01:49,410 --> 00:01:52,930
I mean I just don't get the hate on
those but I'm looking at him and they are

30
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:56,020
gorgeous. It's so gross. And
then on top of them being gross,

31
00:01:56,021 --> 00:01:59,970
they have sneaker lasers which
makes him even more stupid ass.

32
00:02:00,610 --> 00:02:04,870
It's just not for you. I guess. It's
like a light gold. I'm thinking of like,

33
00:02:04,871 --> 00:02:09,670
you know like hold on that
one. Oh No, you're right. How?

34
00:02:09,890 --> 00:02:13,830
Wow. Wow. Those are gold TV
suck. Is it a contrast then?

35
00:02:14,170 --> 00:02:16,180
That one looks different.
That one's better. That looks

36
00:02:18,620 --> 00:02:19,240
totally like good.

37
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:23,020
I have to walk the red carpet after
Bruce Willis in those shoes and some guy

38
00:02:23,021 --> 00:02:27,460
goes, killer boots man. Like a dumb and
dumber. I'm like, yeah, Bruce Willis,

39
00:02:27,461 --> 00:02:29,770
that old ass can't pull these off.
Everyone started laughing,

40
00:02:29,771 --> 00:02:33,190
but I think he heard it. I was like,
Oh, Mr. Die hard. Please, please don't.

41
00:02:33,310 --> 00:02:34,720
Please don't judge me,
but I will.

42
00:02:34,721 --> 00:02:38,340
We'll kick you and these things don't
get it twisted. The St the movies.

43
00:02:39,730 --> 00:02:42,400
Yeah. There's something
about like leaving that foot,

44
00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:44,830
that buckle mark on someone's forehead.

45
00:02:45,070 --> 00:02:48,640
Embarrassing just for claim guy and
skinny jeans and those boots whooped your

46
00:02:48,641 --> 00:02:49,600
ass.
That's embarrassing.

47
00:02:49,630 --> 00:02:53,760
Do you remember when Pete Williams
had kicked Mark Coleman? Oh my God.

48
00:02:54,610 --> 00:02:58,020
It was just like, why can't the
world sound like a bat? It was a,

49
00:02:58,060 --> 00:03:02,140
it was also like one of like what
the fuck? Like, who saw that comment?

50
00:03:02,350 --> 00:03:06,160
Like we thought that Pete who was a
young guy is dealing with Coleman who was

51
00:03:06,161 --> 00:03:10,300
just all super gorilla,
Super Carrillo and then you know,

52
00:03:10,301 --> 00:03:14,290
Pete wore his ass out and landed
that perfectly place head kick.

53
00:03:14,470 --> 00:03:19,210
If he had that buck on dead,
you would see that mark forever.

54
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:22,640
That Gucci. Gucci. Yeah. I mean Pika,

55
00:03:22,641 --> 00:03:26,310
I'm tired people. I'm such a bad
mother fucker back here it is.

56
00:03:26,620 --> 00:03:30,880
Boom. Got that Async label
on his face though. Yeah.

57
00:03:31,090 --> 00:03:34,580
Damn Joy. The may six, that was
a big, that was a bad week when,

58
00:03:34,810 --> 00:03:38,810
damn that dude is steak and
chicken drug tests. See that.

59
00:03:38,830 --> 00:03:42,250
If you had that mark like that,
like your boots on boom.

60
00:03:42,310 --> 00:03:44,950
And just I'm thinking
Hootchie Gootchie baby. Yeah.

61
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:49,960
If you notice Pete kicked him to choose
on last fights that you can kick people.

62
00:03:51,310 --> 00:03:55,030
He thinks I'm more like with
the point. Yeah. Hell yeah. Uh,

63
00:03:55,300 --> 00:03:59,620
doing a wheel kick, like a
spinning heel. Chicken some boots.

64
00:04:00,850 --> 00:04:04,810
Yeah, I guess. I think with the heel
kicked out, quite honestly doesn't,

65
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:07,220
I don't think it matters.
It lands, it lands well.

66
00:04:07,230 --> 00:04:10,360
It's so there's so much power
in that cake. And if you land,

67
00:04:10,361 --> 00:04:12,320
you're landing with your
heel and your heel can,

68
00:04:12,430 --> 00:04:16,360
it's not like a knuckle at breaks
and he never break your, he'll never,

69
00:04:16,690 --> 00:04:20,950
I did hit somebody wants so hard that
my foot was sore and I was limping for a

70
00:04:20,950 --> 00:04:23,560
couple days where the heel kick
with a heel kiss was horrible.

71
00:04:23,561 --> 00:04:27,790
It was hit the hell out of them.
He went to sleep for a long time.

72
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:31,030
They took him to the house. It
was scary. I was 19. That's bad.

73
00:04:31,060 --> 00:04:33,700
I think I didn't tell you this story
is a fucked up story because it made me

74
00:04:33,701 --> 00:04:35,350
reconsider.
Fighting wrote and killed.

75
00:04:35,351 --> 00:04:39,070
He guy was this a thing I said to my
instructor because my instructor wasn't

76
00:04:39,071 --> 00:04:43,660
there cause he's in California. I was
in, I was in Boston and uh, he goes,

77
00:04:43,661 --> 00:04:47,380
I heard you had a really good
knockout, you know, exact
same. Yeah. And I go, yeah,

78
00:04:47,381 --> 00:04:48,610
it was,
it was scary.

79
00:04:48,730 --> 00:04:53,290
I go a condom with a wheel kick and I go
and he just didn't get up and I thought

80
00:04:53,291 --> 00:04:57,730
he was dead. He goes, sometimes
they die. And walks away.

81
00:04:57,760 --> 00:05:00,610
Dead serious. Dead serious.
Yeah. He was training troops.

82
00:05:02,350 --> 00:05:06,910
Old School. Yeah. He didn't care at
all and I was like, but wait a minute.

83
00:05:06,940 --> 00:05:09,550
They died. I'm them. I'm, hey man.

84
00:05:10,630 --> 00:05:14,500
I got for sure disposable. I wasn't the
best for sure. Somebody get a fuck me.

85
00:05:15,540 --> 00:05:19,240
I never got head kicked, but I saw people
that I was close to get head kicked in.

86
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:21,600
Ever get killed in tournaments.
Just Tko.

87
00:05:21,610 --> 00:05:26,080
Tko boxing match and kickboxing match
where they stopped. You got rock,

88
00:05:26,081 --> 00:05:28,630
then he came in and stopped it.
Yeah. I got rock with a left hook.

89
00:05:29,050 --> 00:05:32,620
I got my legs just shut off point.
Where does that,

90
00:05:32,650 --> 00:05:36,040
it's the weirdest feeling of all time.
What people think is that like it hurts.

91
00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:37,660
No liver shot hurts.

92
00:05:38,020 --> 00:05:41,740
Like if you get kicked to the liver or
punched in the liver and your whole body

93
00:05:41,741 --> 00:05:45,970
will die and your legs kind of give out,
that hurts.

94
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:48,130
But this is a weird thing
about getting hit on the chin.

95
00:05:48,131 --> 00:05:52,700
It's like everything just
goes surreal feeling. Yeah.

96
00:05:53,050 --> 00:05:56,080
Just stops working and
let my body would get hot.

97
00:05:59,530 --> 00:06:04,190
It's a weird word. The worst man. What
is it like to get completely flatlined?

98
00:06:04,940 --> 00:06:09,230
Um, it, it's nothing because you
don't, you don't feel anything. Right.

99
00:06:09,231 --> 00:06:12,140
So you don't feel anything. You don't,
when you come out of it. What's your,

100
00:06:12,470 --> 00:06:16,280
what's your most recent memory?
Not much. Everything's a little,

101
00:06:16,910 --> 00:06:19,010
a little like fuzzy.

102
00:06:19,011 --> 00:06:22,340
And then someone tells you what happened
and then you remember certain parts of

103
00:06:22,341 --> 00:06:26,090
the fight. Like God, I remember doing
that and that and then what happened?

104
00:06:27,020 --> 00:06:29,660
You know what I'm saying? Like you have
to piece it, like puzzle it together.

105
00:06:29,700 --> 00:06:31,460
This is one. And then you get
in the back, cause there's,

106
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:35,780
there's two type of people that when
you get concussed or flatline in my

107
00:06:35,890 --> 00:06:39,740
experiences, you react to it two
ways. One, you get really emotional,

108
00:06:39,890 --> 00:06:44,150
like heartbroken, sat like super,
Super Sad. The other gets really,

109
00:06:44,151 --> 00:06:47,620
really upset, like mad
super mad. And I, I,

110
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:50,750
I've always seen those
two opposites new thing.

111
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:55,820
It is this from concussed or is this
from the emotions of losing and realizing

112
00:06:55,821 --> 00:06:59,120
you lost after it's all over?
I think it's a combination of both.

113
00:06:59,780 --> 00:07:00,980
You know what I'm saying?
Yeah.

114
00:07:01,250 --> 00:07:04,040
But this is one of the reasons why I want
to bring this up is because everybody

115
00:07:04,041 --> 00:07:07,520
always wants to talk about
the power of belief, you know,

116
00:07:07,610 --> 00:07:11,420
and how important the power of belief
is. And it's super important. You know,

117
00:07:11,421 --> 00:07:12,650
instead it's a big factor.

118
00:07:12,651 --> 00:07:15,920
And Connor success is this like
insane belief he has in himself.

119
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:21,640
But even with the power of belief at
10 you still have to deal with the

120
00:07:22,551 --> 00:07:24,230
limitations to the body.
Correct.

121
00:07:24,260 --> 00:07:27,410
And you still have to deal with like
what is the reality of getting hit on the

122
00:07:27,411 --> 00:07:29,490
chin? Correct. But that,

123
00:07:29,510 --> 00:07:33,820
that self belief that Connor has got him
into the biggest fight in combat sports

124
00:07:33,830 --> 00:07:37,160
history on her feet and had a
little bit of doubt. We're not here.

125
00:07:37,190 --> 00:07:41,060
You're 100% you're talking about them.
I know. So it's a fine line say ah,

126
00:07:41,250 --> 00:07:44,660
self belief only goes so
far, man. Even myself,

127
00:07:44,670 --> 00:07:48,080
I myself belief was so high
private match my skills,

128
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:50,720
but I was so confident I could
beat anyone in the world.

129
00:07:51,020 --> 00:07:54,770
I beat a lot of guys that probably had
no business beating or just getting

130
00:07:54,771 --> 00:07:58,850
through the beat cro cop. He's a legend
and you beat him by knockout. Yeah,

131
00:07:59,150 --> 00:08:01,580
but like get getting
through golden gloves. Man.

132
00:08:01,700 --> 00:08:04,460
I thought I was the next Mike
Tyson. I brought, probably not,

133
00:08:04,461 --> 00:08:06,410
but I beat most of those
guys. Just stuff. Sure. Whale.

134
00:08:06,411 --> 00:08:10,390
But I believed in my heart of hearts I
was going to be the best of all time. No,

135
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:11,750
you were a competitor.

136
00:08:11,870 --> 00:08:15,290
And there's some people that have
a hard time with the big moment.

137
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:19,280
Conor obviously shines in the big moment,
but at the end of the day,

138
00:08:19,550 --> 00:08:23,390
even with that insane belief,
you get to see his physical limitations.

139
00:08:23,540 --> 00:08:28,070
But what you got to see though is, well,
you got to see a lot in that fight,

140
00:08:28,130 --> 00:08:31,430
but you don't know what's going
to happen until they do it.

141
00:08:31,460 --> 00:08:34,400
That's why I didn't fight.
So he has this amazing, uh,

142
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:38,300
belief in himself and he had a
really interesting style man,

143
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:41,120
that whole thing where he was doing
like putting his hands out there and,

144
00:08:41,300 --> 00:08:43,070
and pap pap pap and them.
Yeah.

145
00:08:43,430 --> 00:08:47,040
And then throwing off offspeed
punches and then drop out.

146
00:08:47,180 --> 00:08:49,520
And his ankles were so good,

147
00:08:49,610 --> 00:08:54,610
so good and and so exaggerated in
big huge get Floyd's back and Floyd.

148
00:08:55,270 --> 00:08:57,870
Scary, smart. He wouldn't turn into
him. They give him more of an angle.

149
00:08:57,960 --> 00:09:00,000
He just cover up because you had
the ref was going to stop it.

150
00:09:00,690 --> 00:09:05,240
The real MVP of that fight, granted,
you know Conor and Floyd, that Raf, oh,

151
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:08,130
I read them fine. You're the
real MVP. Panted he came,

152
00:09:08,490 --> 00:09:12,300
his opening dialogue with the hell was
that he was just staring at Mcgregor like

153
00:09:12,510 --> 00:09:15,970
now we don't want to know that that
gay Raslan in just like students.

154
00:09:16,010 --> 00:09:18,840
I don't think he said that.
I think I thought he was way over the top.

155
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:21,300
I wanted the fight to start,

156
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:23,940
so I thought he was over the top
because I wanted to fight. Come on,

157
00:09:23,941 --> 00:09:28,530
let's go with this fucking national
anthem. Do you do that in a locked room?

158
00:09:28,531 --> 00:09:33,510
But I just thought it was off to the
wrong foot, but I think he, granted,

159
00:09:33,540 --> 00:09:38,400
I don't think Connor was going to win
that fight as it went on. However he,

160
00:09:38,730 --> 00:09:41,700
the Connor did have an advantage
if they went in tight heat,

161
00:09:41,701 --> 00:09:45,120
even let it get there yet
grappling under hooks. What,

162
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:48,090
and that was where Conor
was going to get his rest.

163
00:09:48,210 --> 00:09:51,900
He didn't have that opportunity as soon
as they got to that ref separated. Yeah,

164
00:09:52,110 --> 00:09:54,180
it was good. He was gonna let him fight
it. Yeah, he was in London fight though.

165
00:09:54,181 --> 00:09:55,770
He was the perfect rest.
However,

166
00:09:55,890 --> 00:09:59,250
I think Connor thought you'd be able to
get his rest in those moments and just

167
00:09:59,251 --> 00:10:01,570
never was capable of doing
it cause the ref would,

168
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:04,530
I think he got more tired than he ever
thought it was going to or down to.

169
00:10:04,531 --> 00:10:06,660
Also the efficiency of Floyd.
Here's what I did.

170
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:11,790
I watched it live from the third round
on. I got offstage, Washington DC,

171
00:10:11,791 --> 00:10:14,670
the first two I ran upstate.
I did last yesterday.

172
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:18,740
I watched it yesterday when I
get home, but I flew home. Um,

173
00:10:18,810 --> 00:10:19,920
our mayor flew upstairs.

174
00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:23,540
It was that they had it on paper
view in the upstairs green rooms.

175
00:10:23,541 --> 00:10:25,680
So we ran upstairs type
move. Yeah, it was,

176
00:10:25,681 --> 00:10:28,830
but I caught on the third round and yell
and Ian Edwards, I'm like, I'm like,

177
00:10:28,831 --> 00:10:30,750
how's it going? He goes, the fights.
Great. This is a great fight.

178
00:10:30,751 --> 00:10:33,720
So I got in there like writing it.
I didn't want to give,

179
00:10:33,740 --> 00:10:36,330
this is people waiting in line a
long time. The show started late.

180
00:10:36,570 --> 00:10:40,330
People bought tickets months in advance
and I'm like, I'm not cut my show short.

181
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:40,460
Yeah,

182
00:10:40,460 --> 00:10:42,990
I'm going to do the full show and then
I'm gonna thank everybody good night and

183
00:10:42,991 --> 00:10:46,520
then watch the fight for a better person.
So I ran upstairs and uh,

184
00:10:46,521 --> 00:10:49,340
I got in the third round
so I didn't see all the,

185
00:10:49,341 --> 00:10:52,290
the speech until I heard about
it afterwards so that I heard it.

186
00:10:52,750 --> 00:10:56,430
I tried to watch from the time
they were both walking out,

187
00:10:56,670 --> 00:11:00,630
but the national and um,
stop.

188
00:11:00,631 --> 00:11:03,330
I love America.
I'm not mad at Demi Lovato.

189
00:11:03,331 --> 00:11:06,060
She can sing when ever
she would go to a concert.

190
00:11:07,030 --> 00:11:11,640
It's an American flag. It's on
my phone. Okay. I love America.

191
00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:15,570
Love it. I'm a big proponent
in the best aspects of America,

192
00:11:15,630 --> 00:11:20,100
but to see, I like the rocket's
red glare and the bumps.

193
00:11:24,420 --> 00:11:28,410
I couldn't get enough. I
was standing ovation. Bravo.

194
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:33,060
She's a beautiful singer. No doubt in her
shit from a teleprompter though. Well,

195
00:11:33,210 --> 00:11:36,210
it's probably a good move. You don't want
to fuck it up. Like who fucked it up?

196
00:11:36,211 --> 00:11:39,050
Miley Cyrus and she fucked it up.
There's been some people that fucking,

197
00:11:39,060 --> 00:11:43,080
somebody forgot the words. Somebody
fucked, fucked up the words. Oh,

198
00:11:43,081 --> 00:11:47,250
Christina Aguilera. That's who it was
that her, that was Christina when she was,

199
00:11:47,530 --> 00:11:50,670
she was going through a tough time,
which got a little heavy back then.

200
00:11:50,870 --> 00:11:54,040
Remember that? Yeah. She got
heavy. Christina, like unsexy,

201
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:57,250
thick. Like she got a little
over the line to like,

202
00:11:57,251 --> 00:12:00,010
what's going on to too many supersizes.

203
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:03,610
It's not just that like when
someone gets that big that quick,

204
00:12:03,670 --> 00:12:06,730
you start thinking about depression. You
know that wasn't Roseanne Barr. Well,

205
00:12:06,731 --> 00:12:07,630
you know what she did though?

206
00:12:07,631 --> 00:12:10,420
That was back in the day when
Roseanne was on top of the world.

207
00:12:10,630 --> 00:12:15,490
She grabbed a pussy and spit,
which is hilarious. Yeah.

208
00:12:15,580 --> 00:12:16,331
She's so sad.

209
00:12:16,331 --> 00:12:20,860
As a savage of savages and people got
Super Mad at her and this was pre social

210
00:12:20,861 --> 00:12:23,860
media, but, but click on
the youtube link to that.

211
00:12:23,861 --> 00:12:26,530
Find out what or if it says there,
when Roseanne did it,

212
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:29,160
[inaudible] year was 1990 and nine Diego.
Yeah.

213
00:12:29,170 --> 00:12:32,910
See totally before the Internet spits
on the ground right before. Why not?

214
00:12:32,950 --> 00:12:36,400
She's an animal. She's an adult.
She's an animal. I love her.

215
00:12:36,630 --> 00:12:40,750
You know Whitney is like executive
producing her new show. That makes sense.

216
00:12:40,780 --> 00:12:44,350
Totally makes sense.
Yeah. And Whitney's like,

217
00:12:44,830 --> 00:12:49,670
she's a great joke writer to phenomenal
writer and probably, I mean I got a fee.

218
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:52,300
I don't, I don't remember really
talking to her too much about Roseanne.

219
00:12:52,930 --> 00:12:56,430
Maybe we did. I look at that. She
grabbed her pussy. It's Spanish traces.

220
00:12:58,180 --> 00:13:01,480
I maintained she one of the top most
important comedians of all time after I

221
00:13:01,490 --> 00:13:03,460
said that to her when she was here,
I said,

222
00:13:03,461 --> 00:13:05,560
you changed the face of women's comedy.
She did.

223
00:13:05,590 --> 00:13:08,620
She changed the face of women's College.
She got her start in Denver son. Yes,

224
00:13:08,621 --> 00:13:13,000
she did. Comedy works, comedy works.
She's a beast with kids at all.

225
00:13:13,001 --> 00:13:17,350
Those kids graduated and a dad moving
out hit the whole deal and the animal

226
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:19,560
fucking animal. I like her. Yeah. Oh,

227
00:13:19,570 --> 00:13:22,780
we're talking about they're
doing a show together. But I got,

228
00:13:22,900 --> 00:13:26,080
what I was going to say is that I gotta
think that Whitney must think about it

229
00:13:26,081 --> 00:13:29,710
the same way most of most of the
comics do. She's super respected.

230
00:13:29,740 --> 00:13:33,820
Rosanna mean super respect.
That's a big job for Whitney.

231
00:13:34,090 --> 00:13:38,650
Fuck yeah, that's huge.
That has a potential,

232
00:13:38,651 --> 00:13:42,250
especially right now, like
what the Hell is on TV? I
agree. You know, you got Kevin.

233
00:13:42,251 --> 00:13:46,600
James has a sitcom name and others
had come. Ready, go. I got nothing.

234
00:13:46,601 --> 00:13:49,330
I got nothing. Goldberg's I'll tell
you what. I did start watching.

235
00:13:49,540 --> 00:13:54,100
I started watching Ozark. Oh my God. It's
good. Those are, what was arc on Netflix?

236
00:13:54,970 --> 00:13:59,470
Oh, Justin Bateman chasing,
chasing, chasing baby.

237
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:04,280
He gets involved with the cartel. Yep.
Seen it. I just saw the dude, dude,

238
00:14:04,281 --> 00:14:09,280
I'll hold up. I'm on season four of game
of Thrones balls deep and who don't,

239
00:14:09,281 --> 00:14:13,890
I cannot get the Dragon Tattoo. And I
was talking all that stay offline. Uh,

240
00:14:14,210 --> 00:14:17,280
people try to send me spoilers. Ain't
happening son. I don't even look at them.

241
00:14:17,290 --> 00:14:21,760
Yeah, you gotta be an engine.
Just the biggest Khaleesi
fan. I will just wait. Oh,

242
00:14:21,761 --> 00:14:25,540
I can't wait. The queen of
dragons. Just wait. Those dragons.

243
00:14:26,150 --> 00:14:29,920
John's know this. I know I'm going to
say anything but this season finale,

244
00:14:30,370 --> 00:14:34,060
just Jesus Christ and then I see people
online where the g game of Thrones lost

245
00:14:34,061 --> 00:14:38,350
its way. I'm like, how about you
fuck off. How about you, him haters.

246
00:14:38,351 --> 00:14:40,660
Everyone's going to hate on
anything, man. I'll tell you what.

247
00:14:40,661 --> 00:14:44,630
The white walkers though, I'm on season
three. Them graphics were tough on,

248
00:14:44,631 --> 00:14:47,800
see it looked like a tare out there.
That's like white things.

249
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:52,220
Get to season seven I saw can fund. I
saw one. They look like some super beast.

250
00:14:52,250 --> 00:14:53,810
Oh yeah.
They've got that wired.

251
00:14:53,900 --> 00:14:57,150
They know how to do it at an ice
wall and the game is that real?

252
00:14:57,260 --> 00:14:59,930
There's like a shut the fuck up.
It's like the flat earth, right?

253
00:14:59,930 --> 00:15:04,460
Let me start there. The same thing
or it's not the same across the wall.

254
00:15:05,990 --> 00:15:10,040
I mean, I think it's in
the north. In the north.

255
00:15:10,041 --> 00:15:14,390
You've got to keep a war. How good
is it? It's fucking phenomenal.

256
00:15:15,170 --> 00:15:18,080
I'm so happy I was.
I'm telling you I could not sleep.

257
00:15:18,081 --> 00:15:23,030
I was so happy that King Joffrey died.
That little bitch. Spoiler alert. Hey Bro,

258
00:15:23,150 --> 00:15:28,070
they're on season seven,
five years. Three alert.

259
00:15:28,370 --> 00:15:31,850
People will get mad.
How dare you Shab I'm on season one.

260
00:15:32,410 --> 00:15:35,510
If it's more than three years old,
I'm allowed to talk about it for sure.

261
00:15:35,511 --> 00:15:38,450
People get mad if you talk about something
that happened 10 years ago though.

262
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:40,640
They get mad like if they haven't seen it,

263
00:15:40,641 --> 00:15:44,600
it's like you're not supposed
to discuss things. Hey Bro.

264
00:15:44,630 --> 00:15:49,240
How to, yeah. Yeah. I love it though.

265
00:15:49,250 --> 00:15:51,050
I'm obsessed with game of Thrones.
All I watch right now,

266
00:15:51,051 --> 00:15:53,750
it's the best show of all time.
I think the writing,

267
00:15:53,751 --> 00:15:57,500
but I'll say that about other shows to
me to say that I get excited. Me Too.

268
00:15:57,501 --> 00:16:00,620
I'll throw that out no matter what. If
I get enthusiastic, don't hold me to it.

269
00:16:00,621 --> 00:16:03,340
I'm not some fucking ranking committee.
You know what I mean? He's like

270
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:08,150
the UFC ranking. You know
what? We're like to use rings.

271
00:16:08,151 --> 00:16:09,120
We just throw up whatever you want.

272
00:16:11,470 --> 00:16:13,580
However I feel I'm just going to do that.
All right.

273
00:16:13,790 --> 00:16:16,400
Give it to us number one next
week. I don't know. We'll see.

274
00:16:16,490 --> 00:16:18,470
I think Max Kellerman
is walking around today.

275
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:20,780
How many people are fucking with him?
I saw him this morning.

276
00:16:20,810 --> 00:16:23,390
Hundred Mcgregor will not land
a single punch. Meanwhile,

277
00:16:23,420 --> 00:16:25,900
he landed more punches
on Floyd Mayweather.

278
00:16:25,901 --> 00:16:30,890
An any boxer ever than many Pacquiao and
Miguel Cotto. Yeah. And then people go,

279
00:16:30,950 --> 00:16:34,670
oh, this is a fricking
Max is a debate. Oh,

280
00:16:34,671 --> 00:16:38,360
well that's because Floyd led
them. That was his style. Hey man,

281
00:16:38,420 --> 00:16:42,920
let's give Connor sub credit some credit.
His pace was so high.

282
00:16:42,921 --> 00:16:46,610
I think cottage pace was so high and he
thought it was me landing more shots.

283
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:49,370
He just wore himself out.
He's a little bit of that.

284
00:16:49,430 --> 00:16:53,850
I think there's a little
bit of an efficiency issue
that you know, John, Donna,

285
00:16:53,851 --> 00:16:58,850
her go to John Donahoe, his
Instagram page, please. John Donner,

286
00:16:58,851 --> 00:16:59,720
who's, um, you know,

287
00:16:59,750 --> 00:17:02,750
one of the best grapplers you to
master World Jujitsu mastermind.

288
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:07,410
He's also a brilliant guy. He's like
Elon Musk of Jujitsu, basically cap,

289
00:17:07,550 --> 00:17:10,700
super smart, innovative
guy. But on top of that,

290
00:17:10,730 --> 00:17:14,570
he wrote an assessment of how he
thinks the fight's going to play out.

291
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:19,430
And it was to at t spot on
about the cardio. Is that um,

292
00:17:19,570 --> 00:17:24,280
Donna her said that he was gonna um, stop
him sometime, uh, after the fifth round.

293
00:17:24,290 --> 00:17:28,280
What does it say? Yeah. Tonight is
the biggest night BP. BP. Oh Man.

294
00:17:28,281 --> 00:17:32,750
It's the way to long John. Well, he does
that. He's just too small. Well, it's hey,

295
00:17:32,751 --> 00:17:36,680
but create a blog though,
huh? You know? Yeah.

296
00:17:36,681 --> 00:17:41,600
I mean basically he said here I consider
a fine a victory for Mr Mcgregor if he

297
00:17:41,601 --> 00:17:43,180
survived 12 rounds. Yeah. See,

298
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:47,120
scroll up a little bit and he'll explain
how he said that it usually works. Yeah.

299
00:17:47,121 --> 00:17:50,040
Here it goes. They are quite
competitive. The first three to four

300
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:52,650
rounds and he surprisingly,
well then around the fifth round,

301
00:17:52,651 --> 00:17:56,370
the elite boxer begins to figure out
the unorthodox were awkward movement and

302
00:17:56,371 --> 00:17:58,880
begins to employ ring craft tactics,
attire,

303
00:17:58,890 --> 00:18:03,090
the MMA athlete by making more harder
than he is making mispunches et cetera.

304
00:18:03,270 --> 00:18:04,320
Around the eighth round.

305
00:18:04,321 --> 00:18:07,590
A very noticeable shift occurs
where the elite boxer takes over.

306
00:18:07,620 --> 00:18:09,840
I expect a similar pattern tonight though.

307
00:18:09,841 --> 00:18:12,810
Probably taking less time given the
incredible skill lever, Mr Mayweather.

308
00:18:13,380 --> 00:18:16,480
But it was the exact thing
around the eighth round May,

309
00:18:16,481 --> 00:18:18,600
whether it was clearly shaken
over the ninth round May,

310
00:18:18,601 --> 00:18:22,770
whether it was getting was fucking
Connor off was teeing off on Connor and I

311
00:18:22,771 --> 00:18:25,200
actually texted to my friend in
between rounds. I'm like, he's done.

312
00:18:25,410 --> 00:18:28,140
They're going to stop. I gotta stop last
round. They threatened to go to the,

313
00:18:28,350 --> 00:18:32,190
to the back to do some for
showtime. I was like, it's over.

314
00:18:32,220 --> 00:18:35,310
They wouldn't let you know. They did.
That made you go, you gotta go back.

315
00:18:35,311 --> 00:18:39,360
You miss some of it. Well, I
didn't want to see it really.
I knew it was over. Yeah.

316
00:18:39,361 --> 00:18:41,820
So then, but then they put me
Kate side. I was, wait, weren't,

317
00:18:41,940 --> 00:18:45,570
you didn't want to see it? Uh, not
really. I knew what was happening. I just,

318
00:18:45,571 --> 00:18:47,760
I dunno. I Dunno. How could
you not want to see it?

319
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:51,060
I knew what I was going to happen. I
then she would watch rocky movies, Bro.

320
00:18:51,750 --> 00:18:55,920
I wish, man, but I'm glad they stopped
it early. I wasn't mad at the stoppage.

321
00:18:56,040 --> 00:18:58,920
I wasn't either.
I wasn't mad cause for number of reasons,

322
00:18:58,921 --> 00:19:02,040
but he has a lot more fight left in
and there's no, we got it. You got it.

323
00:19:02,360 --> 00:19:04,320
Connor did well.
He wants some rounds.

324
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:06,990
He's going to get fucked up in
the next round if he made it.

325
00:19:07,130 --> 00:19:10,590
If he made into 11th Floyd Mayweather
was going to fuck him up. Correct.

326
00:19:10,620 --> 00:19:14,880
Like real bad. He was gas in. But you're
Connor and even Floyd afterwards he goes,

327
00:19:14,970 --> 00:19:18,060
Floyd, they go, what was the
most surprising thing about
this fight? And he goes,

328
00:19:18,170 --> 00:19:21,000
collars, box and skills. Honestly, I
thought I'd be able to take over early,

329
00:19:21,330 --> 00:19:24,390
but I wasn't able to because
of his boxing skills. He goes,

330
00:19:24,391 --> 00:19:28,170
I wasn't surprised by his
power. There wasn't much power
there, which is, you know,

331
00:19:28,171 --> 00:19:31,680
whatever. He ate that upper flow
straight up flush up or kept from Connor.

332
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:35,040
But Conor did not seem like he was
putting a lot of power in its punches.

333
00:19:35,041 --> 00:19:36,900
It looks like he was trying
to be like real active,

334
00:19:37,560 --> 00:19:40,590
but then also he was like kind of winging
them too while he was hitting him with

335
00:19:40,591 --> 00:19:44,250
some weird stuff like this. And he'd
even did a bunch of Hammerfest and stuff.

336
00:19:44,430 --> 00:19:47,070
Did you know for every
illegal shot that he,

337
00:19:47,550 --> 00:19:51,990
if he got [inaudible] for $10
million out of his purse, 10 Mil.

338
00:19:52,290 --> 00:19:53,123
So when everyone's like,

339
00:19:53,190 --> 00:19:56,670
how do you know he's just not going to
throw a knee or an elbow, like a savage,

340
00:19:56,820 --> 00:19:57,480
like,
well,

341
00:19:57,480 --> 00:20:02,480
there's 10 million reasons why I get mail
hairdresser that that was the media I

342
00:20:02,971 --> 00:20:05,240
dealt with a media row. All how, you know,

343
00:20:05,250 --> 00:20:07,470
he's just not going to
throw a knee and flip out.

344
00:20:11,190 --> 00:20:13,740
How do you know Brendon? How do you
know he's not going to need him? Right.

345
00:20:13,741 --> 00:20:14,574
And then

346
00:20:16,270 --> 00:20:19,650
people saw it and I'd have
to go from having now,

347
00:20:21,890 --> 00:20:25,740
even now, isn't it funny that
there's no idea as a gay voice,

348
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:30,300
like if you do that voice, everyone
knows it's a game. There's not a lesbian.

349
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:34,270
There's, well, there's really
not a butch lesbian. Oh,

350
00:20:34,350 --> 00:20:38,360
that seems to be a female truck
driver that loves Dick Smokes.

351
00:20:38,650 --> 00:20:43,450
Marlboro is every hour. Leroy's it doesn't
necessarily mean she's a lesbian. Yeah.

352
00:20:43,470 --> 00:20:48,410
Large March. March, March,
March. Yes. Greg Roberts

353
00:20:48,460 --> 00:20:52,360
large.
That's what I was Sturge bars.

354
00:20:52,361 --> 00:20:57,180
Sencha I was terrified. A
large march. You really,

355
00:20:57,190 --> 00:21:00,880
the big blue balls poke out
dude.

356
00:21:00,881 --> 00:21:05,740
Peewee's big adventure, right?
First one. First one yet.

357
00:21:06,100 --> 00:21:09,490
God Damn. If she was scary.
Great movie. Yeah, man.

358
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,310
Oh,
we can hear it.

359
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:19,800
He's all freaked out and when
they finally pulled the drivers,

360
00:21:22,060 --> 00:21:22,893
Johnny,

361
00:21:36,670 --> 00:21:40,390
I love that movie.
I'm so glad you got that reference dude.

362
00:21:40,391 --> 00:21:43,600
Peewee's big adventure was one of
my favorite movies when I was a kid.

363
00:21:43,601 --> 00:21:48,480
I went with my high school girlfriend.
We went and we were fucking crying.

364
00:21:49,550 --> 00:21:53,050
We just couldn't believe how hard we
were laughing. It was so good, man.

365
00:21:53,080 --> 00:21:57,940
It was so silly. Then the next one after
that was a big Top, big top pee. Wee pig

366
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:02,940
is a little pig.
That was his best friend.

367
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,640
Feed them sandwiches and shit while
he's trying to get with that girl.

368
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:10,930
Is he silly fucking movie? If you've
never seen that movie and you smoke weed,

369
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:15,430
you are in luck. Large March. Just
fire one up. Makes a cameo though.

370
00:22:15,460 --> 00:22:19,530
She's not there for long. Long enough.
It'd be nice. We're still talking to

371
00:22:22,250 --> 00:22:27,100
that movie came out in like 84 right?
1989

372
00:22:29,130 --> 00:22:31,690
that's when the show came out
because I was born in 83 pull it up,

373
00:22:31,990 --> 00:22:34,810
pull it up because I was in high school,
say early nineties man,

374
00:22:35,110 --> 00:22:37,210
my mom had the VHS.
It's all we'd watch.

375
00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:40,280
I graduated high school in
[inaudible] 85 and this is, uh,

376
00:22:40,330 --> 00:22:44,680
my high school girlfriend and I went to
see it. Mm. Maybe she was in high school.

377
00:22:45,130 --> 00:22:46,870
Whoa. Oh Damn. Joe Rogan.

378
00:22:47,170 --> 00:22:50,740
1985 c Sun.
I was,

379
00:22:50,860 --> 00:22:54,220
I 100% remember being in high
school and she was in high school.

380
00:22:54,490 --> 00:22:59,050
We were both in school and we went
to see it. Wow. Powerful Giotto.

381
00:22:59,320 --> 00:23:03,730
His bike was sick. Was that was before
the TV show or, I don't know, man.

382
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:06,370
I think the TV show was out
before that. A kid show, I guess.

383
00:23:06,371 --> 00:23:10,540
I mean the kids that a HBO special. Oh
yeah. That was later. That was later.

384
00:23:10,690 --> 00:23:13,750
I think he does that show up like
straight up ABC though. Remember?

385
00:23:13,751 --> 00:23:15,460
I would watch it in the mornings.
Why? I was saying I was,

386
00:23:15,461 --> 00:23:19,380
I thought it was after that he was house
and then he got caught like jacking off

387
00:23:19,390 --> 00:23:20,290
to the theater.
Right.

388
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:24,520
That was actually after all that he got
caught Jackin off after he stopped doing

389
00:23:24,521 --> 00:23:25,900
the TV show.
Really?

390
00:23:25,901 --> 00:23:28,890
I thought it was like in the middle
of the nineties I was like 90 rolling.

391
00:23:28,990 --> 00:23:32,770
How's this crew going to take an l? Just
cause he jacked off in a movie theater.

392
00:23:32,950 --> 00:23:36,040
Yeah. That was back in the
day where we already had VHS.

393
00:23:36,250 --> 00:23:38,140
Like if you jacked off and
it was in a movie theater,

394
00:23:38,141 --> 00:23:41,740
that was the only way to jack off.
Everybody's like, Eh, we understand. Yeah,

395
00:23:41,741 --> 00:23:44,020
that's what I'm saying.
Give the guy a break.

396
00:23:44,021 --> 00:23:48,380
But if you jack off in a movie theater
when we have VHS, well you're a pervert.

397
00:23:48,660 --> 00:23:53,660
91 damn arrested for masturbating and an
adult theater in [inaudible] 91 that's

398
00:23:53,721 --> 00:23:56,720
so crazy. What was the movie?
Sarasota. Florida is the problem.

399
00:23:56,780 --> 00:24:00,980
They had a fucking thing in Sarasota
and how do they know that he really did

400
00:24:00,981 --> 00:24:04,370
jack off. He was right. Really? We're
turning up the heat and tiger shark.

401
00:24:04,371 --> 00:24:08,350
Nancy nurse was another one.
Then he went to see, uh Oh, okay,

402
00:24:08,870 --> 00:24:11,720
well that's what people do in those days.
He was only 38 at the time.

403
00:24:12,020 --> 00:24:15,290
38 he's the most shot out. 38 year
old ever seen. Look at that picture.

404
00:24:15,700 --> 00:24:16,533
This picture,

405
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:22,910
it looks like it's like, I like the
blogger at the set of hair on him too.

406
00:24:23,170 --> 00:24:24,110
It looks like a blogger.

407
00:24:24,490 --> 00:24:28,190
Jack's off the guys in a band.

408
00:24:29,290 --> 00:24:33,500
He could totally be like a bass player.
Was He smart? Is he just loaded or what?

409
00:24:33,510 --> 00:24:37,190
Because he was a big deal when I was a
kid. Dad Merchandise and everything man.

410
00:24:37,850 --> 00:24:39,860
Well,
he took a big hit from this.

411
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:42,230
I think if it happened today
it would be no big deal.

412
00:24:42,290 --> 00:24:47,180
But also part of the problem was that he
was like a childhood idol thing because

413
00:24:47,210 --> 00:24:52,210
you know his show was a kid show even
though it was kind of adult themed in a

414
00:24:52,311 --> 00:24:56,510
lot of a way. A lot of ways.
So word of the day. Yeah.

415
00:24:56,511 --> 00:25:00,170
See the HBO Cable Television Show
popularized by [inaudible] in 1982.

416
00:25:01,480 --> 00:25:01,701
Yeah.

417
00:25:01,701 --> 00:25:05,270
He would look up girls skirts with the
aid of mirror as attached to his shoes.

418
00:25:05,540 --> 00:25:09,020
He was like, your regional
character. He's a creep. Why QE?

419
00:25:09,230 --> 00:25:11,480
We taught kids how to do that.
Basically. That's fucked up.

420
00:25:11,510 --> 00:25:15,680
But everybody already knew back then.
Start a fire with a match. Yeah.

421
00:25:15,681 --> 00:25:16,850
It's all good,
man.

422
00:25:17,860 --> 00:25:20,990
Do you know what I think people get
figured out how to put a fucking mirror on

423
00:25:20,991 --> 00:25:24,460
your shoe. That was an old
movies man. But then he just, uh,

424
00:25:24,530 --> 00:25:26,840
he just shot a show for Netflix.

425
00:25:27,140 --> 00:25:31,460
Did it like they made a movie like
periods back, right? Yup. Yup. Wow.

426
00:25:31,490 --> 00:25:35,250
That's a long hiatus. They took them
that long to recover. You know what?

427
00:25:35,251 --> 00:25:38,660
That little too late. You
know, like way too late.

428
00:25:38,780 --> 00:25:41,930
That's like entourage came with that
movie like 10 years after the finale.

429
00:25:41,931 --> 00:25:44,690
Come on, man. Why they do that? It'd
take a long time to make the movie.

430
00:25:44,990 --> 00:25:47,870
I don't know. Personalities didn't
show. We do really well though.

431
00:25:47,930 --> 00:25:52,280
I don't think so. The entourage movie
rotten tomatoes gives it like a zero

432
00:25:54,680 --> 00:25:57,710
bad but didn't do as good as they
needed it to or did not do well.

433
00:25:57,770 --> 00:26:01,760
The critics destroyed that thing. It
was just too late. Men yet turtle.

434
00:26:01,761 --> 00:26:03,050
He's 50 on that bitch.

435
00:26:03,051 --> 00:26:06,650
It's like sex and the city can go back
today and chicks were flocked to it

436
00:26:06,930 --> 00:26:09,430
weren't people piss it a six and the
city movie, they might have been,

437
00:26:09,470 --> 00:26:11,030
well you don't like cause
they can do it with them.

438
00:26:11,150 --> 00:26:13,750
They go through like menopause and
shit the name right, right, right.

439
00:26:13,751 --> 00:26:17,240
Like the young chicks anymore chasing
Dick. Well you know it was weird.

440
00:26:17,270 --> 00:26:21,920
It was like that one character of
the, what's her name? Samantha? Yeah,

441
00:26:21,921 --> 00:26:24,290
the slutty character.
Straight up whore. Yeah.

442
00:26:24,740 --> 00:26:28,040
It gave like a lot of women
like they can go. Yeah,

443
00:26:28,070 --> 00:26:30,350
she could do it and I love her.
Why can't I do it?

444
00:26:30,351 --> 00:26:33,110
That's why everyone can relate to
that shit. Like was the smart one.

445
00:26:33,111 --> 00:26:36,650
There's one that career driven was the
whore and you had one of your friends was

446
00:26:36,651 --> 00:26:40,790
one of them I feel like. But they loved
their horror friend. Yeah. So it was like,

447
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:44,310
it gave her it like it was
opposite of slut shaming.

448
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:48,630
Be Yourself. Let your freak
flag fly. Be like, Samantha,

449
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:50,040
everybody's not Samantha,

450
00:26:50,070 --> 00:26:53,190
but Samantha's not everybody like B or
whoever the fuck you are. Who are you?

451
00:26:53,191 --> 00:26:53,850
If you're,

452
00:26:53,850 --> 00:26:56,430
if you're a super freak and you're
around a bunch of squares and then he was

453
00:26:56,431 --> 00:27:01,400
holding it back, get some
strange deck. I'll give you this,

454
00:27:01,430 --> 00:27:06,360
that check. So once it go, just drink a
couple of cosmopolitans. Throw some guy.

455
00:27:06,361 --> 00:27:09,530
You're fucking kidding. Go. Let's
go. Yeah man. What's wrong with that?

456
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:13,350
So let's rock songs. Yeah. As long as
it's not your daughter, you're good. Yeah.

457
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:16,200
Well it's also, as long as you
don't run into the wrong dude,

458
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:18,390
that would be the big
fear of being a woman,

459
00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:23,370
running into some fucking scary guy,
sending bad murderers,

460
00:27:23,910 --> 00:27:26,370
rapists,
terrible person.

461
00:27:26,550 --> 00:27:29,550
Like you're way more likely to
run into that person as a woman,

462
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:34,900
then you are sure. Male predators,
predators drank on Samantha, dropping,

463
00:27:34,940 --> 00:27:38,790
shitting your drinks, you know,
dropping shit into drinks.

464
00:27:38,820 --> 00:27:42,510
That's so rampant. If I was a
girl, I would be terrified of that.

465
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:47,700
I've met so many people that have told
me stories about a guy drug in them or

466
00:27:47,701 --> 00:27:50,070
drug and one of their friends or
drug drugging someone they know.

467
00:27:50,130 --> 00:27:53,340
I thought it was like an old school thing,
but still goes on kind of a friend.

468
00:27:53,341 --> 00:27:56,310
She told me, yeah, she was out at the
club and she goes, and then I woke up.

469
00:27:56,311 --> 00:28:00,300
Luckily nothing happened, but I woke
up no memory of what happened before.

470
00:28:00,301 --> 00:28:04,470
I'm like, yeah man in La, like that's
still happening. She's like, yeah,

471
00:28:04,560 --> 00:28:08,760
100% why the fuck would you take a drink
from a dude though? Like you should be.

472
00:28:08,761 --> 00:28:12,900
You know what I'm saying? Well, it should
be like friendly people. Like, Hey,

473
00:28:12,901 --> 00:28:15,390
would you like a beer? Yeah, sure.
Give you a beer. It should be.

474
00:28:15,391 --> 00:28:18,720
That's how it should be. Should
be. I mean, I, ideal circumstances,

475
00:28:18,990 --> 00:28:23,400
she should be able to, but there's just
too many creeps. The world we live in.

476
00:28:23,401 --> 00:28:25,380
Like what'd you tell your daughters
when they're old enough? Like, Hey,

477
00:28:25,381 --> 00:28:28,200
do not take a drink unless you're,
you know what I'm saying? Of course.

478
00:28:28,290 --> 00:28:31,110
That's what the world we live
in. You can't just, it's not,

479
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:33,030
it's not worth the risk.
I mean,

480
00:28:33,031 --> 00:28:35,940
hopefully you're going to run into only
nice people who give you a drink and

481
00:28:35,941 --> 00:28:38,430
they just want to have some drinks
with friends and have some laughs.

482
00:28:38,431 --> 00:28:41,910
Have you ever heard of girls Roofie to
dude? Never, but I'm sure it's happened.

483
00:28:42,810 --> 00:28:43,830
I did.
Here we will.

484
00:28:43,831 --> 00:28:46,740
You always heard that story about like
the fake urban myth about the Russian

485
00:28:46,741 --> 00:28:48,000
girl who,
uh,

486
00:28:48,030 --> 00:28:50,700
gets you drank and it takes you back to
your own kidney and then you wake up.

487
00:28:50,700 --> 00:28:54,990
Yeah. Such a bag of ice. You wake up with
a bag of ice on your side and stitches.

488
00:28:55,190 --> 00:28:56,850
It tells you to get to
a hospital immediately.

489
00:28:56,880 --> 00:29:01,800
Like what is that an urban legend
could be. I mean, when never happened.

490
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:06,720
That's brings up Jamie's point early
today before the podcast that we need a

491
00:29:06,721 --> 00:29:08,260
more reliable Snopes.
Yeah.

492
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:12,090
Not that Snopes is a reliable cause
apparently it's pretty, pretty reliable,

493
00:29:12,390 --> 00:29:14,940
but nobody is what the problem is.

494
00:29:14,941 --> 00:29:18,660
Nobody wants to listen to Snopes anymore
because it turned out that the dude who

495
00:29:18,670 --> 00:29:23,670
rants Snopes is a freak and like one of
the chicks that is like his number one

496
00:29:24,181 --> 00:29:29,181
employee was a woman who was an escort
until like 2015 and now she's married to

497
00:29:29,401 --> 00:29:32,380
him and he's just a freak.
He's just partying all the time,

498
00:29:32,580 --> 00:29:37,110
having a good old time. But why is
that so bad? Like why does that affect,

499
00:29:37,170 --> 00:29:40,680
and also they have a left lane left
wing bias that a lot of people,

500
00:29:41,560 --> 00:29:44,830
a lot of people think they have
a left wing bias at least. Yeah,

501
00:29:44,900 --> 00:29:46,390
I guess sort of maybe,

502
00:29:46,420 --> 00:29:51,400
but I mean if they're just relaying facts
you can rely on them I think for the

503
00:29:51,401 --> 00:29:53,920
most part. But that's not
enough. Who can you rely on?

504
00:29:53,921 --> 00:29:56,110
Like even on the New York
Times you post on Instagram,

505
00:29:56,111 --> 00:29:59,290
do you see they changed their headache,
they changed it, they changed it.

506
00:30:00,090 --> 00:30:02,350
I went out of my way. I
was like, this is crazy.

507
00:30:02,410 --> 00:30:05,500
I read the New York Times basically
every day. It should be me too.

508
00:30:05,501 --> 00:30:09,530
It should be pretty reliable. I have it
on my app, on my phone, my phone. Yeah.

509
00:30:09,570 --> 00:30:12,510
That's where I go in the morning.
Yeah. I get notifications from them.

510
00:30:12,590 --> 00:30:14,320
Take time to anything happens in the news.

511
00:30:14,620 --> 00:30:18,100
So I read tons of articles
from the New York Times.

512
00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:21,070
Do you see the guy I looked up that
explains to them? No, I didn't.

513
00:30:21,071 --> 00:30:23,030
Wanna I didn't wanna like get personal.
No,

514
00:30:23,080 --> 00:30:26,620
I just wanted to see what was going on.
It just a giant fuck up.

515
00:30:26,650 --> 00:30:30,190
You can't do that. He's also not a
sports writer. He writes more about race.

516
00:30:30,191 --> 00:30:33,720
He's a young guy, you know.
I doubt it. Flight. Yeah.

517
00:30:33,730 --> 00:30:36,550
He Goes New York Times
writer for race. Why? Yeah.

518
00:30:37,030 --> 00:30:39,880
That seems like it would be within your
best interest to keep things fucked up,

519
00:30:41,010 --> 00:30:44,180
you know? I'm not saying maybe
that's why he's here. You know,

520
00:30:44,260 --> 00:30:47,290
like who the hell maybe. I mean, look you,

521
00:30:47,291 --> 00:30:51,460
all you had to know was say what
happened is that after, uh, you know,

522
00:30:51,461 --> 00:30:53,420
just say Floyd Maguire,
Mcgregor,

523
00:30:53,710 --> 00:30:57,790
Floyd Mayweather out classes
and stops Conor McGregor,

524
00:30:57,820 --> 00:31:01,030
it stops and exhausted Conor McGregor
and the 10th round. That's what happened.

525
00:31:01,060 --> 00:31:03,730
He was exhausted.
And he got tagged over and over again,

526
00:31:03,731 --> 00:31:07,030
and Floyd was teeing off on him and his
brilliant performances that really paint

527
00:31:07,031 --> 00:31:09,790
the f the fight though I, I dunno if
I'll put it in the hallway for sure.

528
00:31:09,790 --> 00:31:13,270
Use your words better. And the
headline, you can't say completely,

529
00:31:13,271 --> 00:31:16,600
his face was completely bloodied
and he always went way ropes.

530
00:31:16,920 --> 00:31:19,420
Bidell things are not true.
I don't think you actually watched it.

531
00:31:19,450 --> 00:31:20,081
Reading the headline.

532
00:31:20,081 --> 00:31:23,760
He probably looked at the maybe photos
or someone else's narrative of the fight

533
00:31:23,770 --> 00:31:25,910
photos. Even the of the
bloody, well, you know,

534
00:31:26,410 --> 00:31:29,500
I guess a photo of Connor outside the
ring and Willie's live outside the ring

535
00:31:29,501 --> 00:31:34,000
for God's sakes. I saved the photo man.
Like here's no, no one's face was bloody.

536
00:31:34,090 --> 00:31:36,640
There was no bloody
period. I mean, it just,

537
00:31:36,760 --> 00:31:39,520
it just wasn't bloody like
you could see his face.

538
00:31:39,560 --> 00:31:43,210
Like I got a photo of the
actual stoppage itself, Bro.

539
00:31:43,480 --> 00:31:47,420
At the moment the stoppage happened.
He was a, I mean, you know,

540
00:31:47,430 --> 00:31:50,170
you have like a little bit of two best
under his left eye. There was an affair.

541
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:54,280
No blood. Yeah. He had a mouse from the
right hand land. Again, up. No blood.

542
00:31:54,281 --> 00:31:58,150
Neither guy was. Yeah, the, you don't see
the mouse there. You see his right cheek.

543
00:31:58,151 --> 00:32:01,380
It's under his, let's just read
his eyes were rolling a little bit.

544
00:32:01,410 --> 00:32:05,740
Did you hear 100 million
illegal streaming downloads?

545
00:32:06,190 --> 00:32:10,930
What? 100 million illegal
streams. Holy Shit.

546
00:32:11,380 --> 00:32:14,740
How much revenue they lose.
How about this?

547
00:32:14,741 --> 00:32:19,270
How crazy is this Floyd to warm up in
the back? Someone from his team goes,

548
00:32:19,271 --> 00:32:23,740
Yo Floyd, the systems in California,
Florida down. He goes, God, damn,

549
00:32:23,741 --> 00:32:26,500
those are huge markets here. I'm going
to delay till they figure it out.

550
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:31,360
That's how conscious this mother before
this huge fight. That's good. He goes,

551
00:32:31,361 --> 00:32:31,900
I'm going to wait.

552
00:32:31,900 --> 00:32:34,120
I'm going to wait and it's worth
millions and millions of John Saying,

553
00:32:34,121 --> 00:32:35,380
how brilliant is he?

554
00:32:35,500 --> 00:32:38,830
That was my takeaway with working with
showtime and get so close to Floyd and

555
00:32:39,080 --> 00:32:40,340
doing all this stuff.
He's

556
00:32:40,430 --> 00:32:44,930
so God damn brilliant man. Like
I had preconceived notions. I am.

557
00:32:45,050 --> 00:32:47,480
He's a good boxer.
Outbid good of a businessman.

558
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:52,130
How involved is he known and he doesn't
let anything go on touch without

559
00:32:52,280 --> 00:32:55,790
overseeing everything. Both
everything. He's brilliant.

560
00:32:55,820 --> 00:32:59,630
He's brilliant as a producer or as a
promoter and he's brilliant as a fighter.

561
00:32:59,660 --> 00:33:01,730
Brilliant. Then they asked him about, uh,

562
00:33:01,910 --> 00:33:06,200
so I was in the fighters meetings and
they have all the serious showtime guys

563
00:33:06,201 --> 00:33:10,550
there and were miked up and all, all
access crew and Floyd's grew and they go,

564
00:33:10,551 --> 00:33:13,100
hey, be careful. Cause last
time we did this with Floyd,

565
00:33:13,370 --> 00:33:15,620
he didn't really know the guys and he
kicked him out in front of everyone was

566
00:33:15,621 --> 00:33:17,780
super embarrassing. So
I'm like, oh that sucks.

567
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:20,810
Some of my suits sitting there and
everyone's so serious. I'm like,

568
00:33:20,811 --> 00:33:25,430
this is so serious, so stuffy in
here. So the guy goes, Jim Gray,

569
00:33:25,550 --> 00:33:29,220
Tim gray goes, hey, up Floyd. They're
like writing the notes down to send there,

570
00:33:29,240 --> 00:33:32,030
like staring down. And
they go, uh, you know,

571
00:33:32,031 --> 00:33:34,640
you always walk out with like an
entourage usually for your fights.

572
00:33:34,641 --> 00:33:36,830
There's usually some big
celebrity or something like that.

573
00:33:36,860 --> 00:33:38,000
Who's it going to be this time?

574
00:33:38,330 --> 00:33:42,590
And I know previously you had beef
with Justin Bieber, so I was like,

575
00:33:42,591 --> 00:33:46,430
well better now than never. I just
went out of turn, not the beads,

576
00:33:47,870 --> 00:33:52,490
the beads
and the FOI laugh Floyd,

577
00:33:52,520 --> 00:33:54,980
he's talking dead to that.
Jim Gray, his glasses on.

578
00:33:55,220 --> 00:33:57,950
He takes the glasses off and goes,
damn dog.

579
00:33:58,760 --> 00:34:02,330
I'm trying to be positive up in here.
We're trying to be positive. And I go,

580
00:34:02,510 --> 00:34:05,640
I start laughing.
I know all the same.

581
00:34:06,360 --> 00:34:08,750
Him walking out with you man,
what's wrong with that?

582
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:10,190
He started laughing after that.

583
00:34:10,920 --> 00:34:15,530
Everyone was literally like on pins and
needles and I was like, come on man.

584
00:34:15,650 --> 00:34:18,680
So bebes is all about Church
now, Huh? Is that the thing?

585
00:34:18,681 --> 00:34:21,260
Like he unfollowed Floyd and
Floyd got mad at him. Yeah.

586
00:34:21,261 --> 00:34:23,810
And that that guy can unfollow your boy.

587
00:34:23,960 --> 00:34:27,150
CanNot follow your boy ever and that
guy never unfollow you ever bro.

588
00:34:27,151 --> 00:34:30,740
If we do then there's some
serious not happening for me.

589
00:34:30,741 --> 00:34:35,420
Where there clap back at Justin
Bieber to try and be positive.

590
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:38,210
He's just a pop star. Floyd says, well,

591
00:34:38,240 --> 00:34:42,470
it's got to a point which is just a pop
star who is probably the biggest pop

592
00:34:42,471 --> 00:34:43,304
store on the planet.

593
00:34:44,270 --> 00:34:47,660
He canceled his tour like he stopped
his tour because of this Jesus thing,

594
00:34:47,661 --> 00:34:51,110
that pretty sky. I know that guy
in the Bible study with a guy.

595
00:34:51,170 --> 00:34:53,990
I've been to dinner with that guy.
He's an interesting dude.

596
00:34:54,350 --> 00:34:58,480
If you're both demon Jesus, he's your
guy. Keep talking. Tell me more. I don't,

597
00:34:58,481 --> 00:35:01,610
I don't want to be out. I don't
wanna I don't want no bad juju on me.

598
00:35:01,611 --> 00:35:04,620
I don't want to be the golden
snitch for pop stars. I,

599
00:35:05,100 --> 00:35:06,310
I don't know what's going on there.

600
00:35:08,340 --> 00:35:12,140
There were saying that Justin Bieber
already made $93 million this year before

601
00:35:12,141 --> 00:35:17,060
he cancelled the tour. How fucking nuts
is that? They kid is balling so hard.

602
00:35:17,110 --> 00:35:20,420
Even him and then I think, yes, I'm do
with Kyrie Irving too. And Kyrie was like,

603
00:35:20,421 --> 00:35:24,500
yeah, I want out of Cleveland. Like this
motherfucker has some power. He's like,

604
00:35:24,501 --> 00:35:27,740
Jesus wants you to play for Boston.
You know that, right? Right.

605
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:31,550
So what is he doing to them? Trying
to get them to, well look, look,

606
00:35:31,551 --> 00:35:34,100
maybe he's doing something. Maybe
I'm looking at the wrong way. Right.

607
00:35:34,130 --> 00:35:38,120
So if he has a positive influence on
them, maybe saying, man, you're, you're,

608
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:42,000
you're so involved in show business
and some of them you got to think about

609
00:35:42,001 --> 00:35:46,350
living and life taking a moment. Not
only that, like, here's the thing man,

610
00:35:46,470 --> 00:35:50,640
once you make $93 million, it's
basically over. I've changes button,

611
00:35:50,641 --> 00:35:53,490
but I'm saying it's over.
Just relax. It's over.

612
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:55,440
You put that fucking money in the bank.

613
00:35:55,650 --> 00:35:58,220
You don't have to work
anymore so I can't work. Yeah.

614
00:35:58,290 --> 00:36:02,310
All the work you do from here on out
is gravy. This is what you do now.

615
00:36:02,370 --> 00:36:03,510
You do what you want to do.

616
00:36:03,511 --> 00:36:06,660
Do you want to go out and do a bunch of
concerts in front of these people or are

617
00:36:06,661 --> 00:36:10,830
you doing too much? Because
if you're working, like if
you, if you had to go and,

618
00:36:10,831 --> 00:36:13,840
uh, do theaters my now you've
been doing a lot of stand up.

619
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:16,800
If you had to do theaters Wednesday,
Thursday, Friday, Saturday, every week,

620
00:36:17,130 --> 00:36:21,510
flying everywhere. Oh, that'd be, we're
so tired. You just see, I'd be like,

621
00:36:21,511 --> 00:36:24,900
Amanda Bynes you just see my hair is
all fucked up. I'd be going crazy.

622
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:29,070
I'd be like Katt Williams.
I engineered how I do like this.

623
00:36:29,071 --> 00:36:32,880
Latin might thi this is the first tour
that I ever named the strange times tour.

624
00:36:33,060 --> 00:36:35,310
The first time I ever sold a
bunch of tickets in advance,

625
00:36:35,311 --> 00:36:36,360
like the smart marketing,

626
00:36:36,361 --> 00:36:40,290
but I engineered that like when
I'm doing these like fly to places,

627
00:36:40,350 --> 00:36:43,840
I'm off for awhile.
That's you'll be gone to do that.

628
00:36:43,860 --> 00:36:47,700
You have to do with that way and Bieber
has the power to kill 100% he just

629
00:36:47,701 --> 00:36:50,850
canceled everything. You just canceled
everything west of the same thing.

630
00:36:51,030 --> 00:36:54,150
What Kanye West did after they
checked him into the loony Bin,

631
00:36:54,210 --> 00:36:57,330
which he was going crazy. They said
he would do that concert, come home.

632
00:36:57,360 --> 00:37:01,710
He had all this work yet to do with the
DDAS and clothing and they just said

633
00:37:01,711 --> 00:37:06,300
he's working nonstop and a
small glimpse of, of, you know,

634
00:37:06,360 --> 00:37:09,210
show business and stand up and
all this stuff. It. I mean,

635
00:37:09,250 --> 00:37:13,230
I can see how being on a tour that
long during go fucking batshit crazy.

636
00:37:13,420 --> 00:37:17,580
I can see a little bit like when I saw
it. Oh, I Batman. That's crazy. Well,

637
00:37:17,581 --> 00:37:21,270
you know what a big factor for me is a
big factor for me is when I'm at home,

638
00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:25,150
I'm going to sleep for eight
hours and I have a schedule. Yes.

639
00:37:25,151 --> 00:37:28,920
In terms of like my runs your
routine by lifts, you know,

640
00:37:28,950 --> 00:37:31,200
whatever workout I'm doing,
whatever kind of thing I'm doing,

641
00:37:31,201 --> 00:37:34,020
I know where I can train.
I know the schools I could train out,

642
00:37:34,021 --> 00:37:38,100
I know the gyms I could train up and
I know what to do. That keeps me sane.

643
00:37:38,490 --> 00:37:41,250
Like having those, like I can work
out on the road and it's good.

644
00:37:41,310 --> 00:37:43,650
It's definitely better than nothing,
but it's not the same.

645
00:37:43,950 --> 00:37:46,470
I've liked being able to have this normal,

646
00:37:46,471 --> 00:37:49,980
like it keeps my energy up
and it keeps my anxiety down.

647
00:37:50,220 --> 00:37:52,560
Like all those things get bounced out.
When I,

648
00:37:52,590 --> 00:37:55,540
when I'm at my normal workout routine,
when I go on the road,

649
00:37:55,570 --> 00:37:56,700
I'm doing three days in a row.

650
00:37:57,450 --> 00:38:00,540
It's hard because I don't want to work
out too hard cause I don't want to be

651
00:38:00,541 --> 00:38:04,260
tired for two shows. Yeah, I've
got two big big ass theater shows,

652
00:38:04,740 --> 00:38:08,760
but I can't imagine those guys who
do five nights, so they're flying in.

653
00:38:08,761 --> 00:38:12,810
So I did two this week, two shows
this weekend. So I flew in three days.

654
00:38:12,811 --> 00:38:17,490
I took three flights. He said, you know,
that's crazy. Crazy. But that's nothing.

655
00:38:17,491 --> 00:38:21,450
It's still under those guys
that do it five days a week,
six days. Well the, well,

656
00:38:21,451 --> 00:38:25,560
even still on private jets, it's still
exhausting. Exhausted. The same thing.

657
00:38:25,660 --> 00:38:27,330
Same thing.
I mean you don't have to,

658
00:38:27,630 --> 00:38:30,540
it goes more on your schedule I guess
if you're flying everywhere for the

659
00:38:30,541 --> 00:38:34,080
private jet, but it's still fucking
exhaust. Still a beast, man. Yeah.

660
00:38:34,110 --> 00:38:35,930
So I get a little, people will go, you

661
00:38:35,980 --> 00:38:40,060
poor baby. I know. Poor oh 93
million. I'm like, theory have money.

662
00:38:40,061 --> 00:38:43,420
So it's not that they're already
set there, it's already gravy.

663
00:38:43,540 --> 00:38:47,470
But without back to the
Bieber Floyd thing again,

664
00:38:47,471 --> 00:38:51,130
I had preconceived notions
of Floyd Mayweather before
I met him, been around him,

665
00:38:51,490 --> 00:38:53,620
sodas,
this religious guy,

666
00:38:53,621 --> 00:38:56,950
he thinks oh Floyd's just about
hoes and cars and stuff like that.

667
00:38:57,280 --> 00:39:01,060
That's all that I guess what he's more,
there's more layers to that.

668
00:39:01,150 --> 00:39:04,090
So for you to judge them based off
social media, say Bieber quit falling,

669
00:39:04,091 --> 00:39:07,290
quit hanging out with him cause he's
just about that. No you don't know shit.

670
00:39:07,300 --> 00:39:10,060
You're judging that guy cause he's
not going to church every Sunday.

671
00:39:10,150 --> 00:39:12,610
You know what I'm saying? Like you're,
you're judging him based off Instagram,

672
00:39:12,611 --> 00:39:16,510
which isn't fair to do you. I think he's
saying like, I dunno what he's saying,

673
00:39:16,630 --> 00:39:19,710
but I would imagine if someone tells you
to stop following somebody that they're

674
00:39:19,720 --> 00:39:21,670
saying there, that person's
a bad influence. Right.

675
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,160
Which isn't fair to say
because Floyd doesn't drink,

676
00:39:24,161 --> 00:39:27,970
has crazy work ethic overseas
bases, showtime sports. Gee,

677
00:39:27,971 --> 00:39:32,440
you know what I'm saying? Like he's
healthy. He doesn't it. It's girls Bro.

678
00:39:32,490 --> 00:39:34,670
Strip clubs.
You don't strip club brought

679
00:39:36,340 --> 00:39:39,970
some of the women he hangs out with.
I had never seen anything like that.

680
00:39:40,010 --> 00:39:44,260
But that's what 15 oh get you. I
mean, jaw dropping shit. Hundreds

681
00:39:47,910 --> 00:39:52,150
and they just look at me like a bag of
shit and he's Gucci shoes. Gucci shoes.

682
00:39:52,810 --> 00:39:55,000
Oh, I get it. Not 15 old girl.

683
00:39:55,120 --> 00:39:59,620
Hundreds of millions of dollars that all
access where they showed that fucking

684
00:39:59,621 --> 00:40:03,490
stupid watch. They bought them that
Hubo Hubo do. I'd met with the guy from,

685
00:40:03,491 --> 00:40:06,580
who will tell me all about it.
Watches so gross nuts.

686
00:40:06,670 --> 00:40:10,480
It's so stupid looking crystal.
One Point two 8 million. No,

687
00:40:10,481 --> 00:40:15,460
it was $500,000 I think they made
another one for 1.2 they made them three.

688
00:40:16,600 --> 00:40:20,620
It's crazy to watch. It's all crystal
like the outside of it is all crystal.

689
00:40:20,650 --> 00:40:24,430
That's an ad. It's so stupid. Look and it
looks like a cheap watch. Yeah, I agree.

690
00:40:24,431 --> 00:40:27,700
Not My style. I do love who blow though.
Shadow. Yeah. They make great watches it,

691
00:40:27,701 --> 00:40:30,580
but that thing, the La Ferrari, isn't
that what it's called? Yeah. Yeah.

692
00:40:30,581 --> 00:40:33,860
There you go. It looks he rose.
Did you see the money belt? Yes.

693
00:40:34,240 --> 00:40:36,230
They handed me that thing.
This is real.

694
00:40:36,231 --> 00:40:39,880
It was kind of small and that I get
it smelt like they just killed that

695
00:40:39,881 --> 00:40:44,230
alligator on the spot. It smelt
like Hummus and allocated.
It smelled like shit,

696
00:40:44,500 --> 00:40:47,350
but then it's just like gold all
over it. I was like, oh my God.

697
00:40:47,550 --> 00:40:50,320
In diamonds and shit and rubies.
Do you know who made that poop?

698
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:51,790
Floyd Mayweather's team.

699
00:40:52,090 --> 00:40:55,080
Did they see a gift to him because they
thought for sure he's going to win that

700
00:40:55,081 --> 00:40:57,820
like yeah, here's this crazy
money fight belt for 1.2 million.

701
00:40:57,820 --> 00:41:00,400
We designed ourselves.
Here you go Floyd. Wow.

702
00:41:00,420 --> 00:41:05,120
Type one point $2 million for
that ugly belt. I was all,

703
00:41:05,590 --> 00:41:09,160
I was all up on that thing. Well tell
me about this then. Are those red?

704
00:41:09,161 --> 00:41:12,430
Is the red all, what are
those, those gems? Are they,

705
00:41:12,490 --> 00:41:15,070
what is the red stuff like in the flags?
All the flags.

706
00:41:15,560 --> 00:41:18,190
Those are just like colors. Those
aren't real. That's not real,

707
00:41:18,191 --> 00:41:20,050
but the diamonds and all that and gold,

708
00:41:20,051 --> 00:41:23,680
all that through most of
is about of all time. Damn.

709
00:41:23,740 --> 00:41:26,380
The thing was sweet dope booking.
Yeah.

710
00:41:26,381 --> 00:41:30,040
It was all fun to like 600 Sapphire's,

711
00:41:30,070 --> 00:41:32,960
160 emeralds, 3000 diamond, sorry,

712
00:41:32,980 --> 00:41:37,730
thousand 360 diamonds and weighs
three pounds of 24 karat gold.

713
00:41:38,600 --> 00:41:41,720
That thing was tiny though.
Pounds of gold that's holding.

714
00:41:41,770 --> 00:41:46,220
It was like a little belt. It wasn't like
the big ass belt. It looks normal sized.

715
00:41:46,310 --> 00:41:48,890
Are they all like that?
Maybe I'm just fucking Shaquille O'Neal,

716
00:41:48,891 --> 00:41:50,030
but if you look at a picture with me,

717
00:41:50,031 --> 00:41:54,170
it looks small checks when they're
holding it up, click on this link. Small.

718
00:41:54,410 --> 00:41:58,400
How weird are the fucking ring car?
Girls do boxing.

719
00:41:58,460 --> 00:42:03,110
They stand around behind everything and
smile from fucking roll the Stepford

720
00:42:03,111 --> 00:42:06,950
wives for our,
that's all they do is pose.

721
00:42:07,190 --> 00:42:11,840
Would that big smile. It's so odd. It's
like they don't express any personality.

722
00:42:12,050 --> 00:42:16,490
They don't do anything other than stand
there and have that same with miles up

723
00:42:16,491 --> 00:42:18,590
there and shit. What do you want him
to do? Yeah, but they're not like,

724
00:42:18,810 --> 00:42:22,490
like looking at each other and talking
about like you have this chance smile.

725
00:42:22,520 --> 00:42:26,060
They're like those English soldiers,
they star and I'll tell you what,

726
00:42:26,061 --> 00:42:30,140
corona does it right. It's what
they're like. Corona does it right.

727
00:42:30,500 --> 00:42:31,880
I'm not mad at any of them.

728
00:42:32,060 --> 00:42:35,680
There was no slump busters
or all of them were tents.

729
00:42:35,820 --> 00:42:39,890
All were stone cold said.
All were shaped stone cold.

730
00:42:39,891 --> 00:42:44,810
Ted's dad smiling. Yeah. And
just not moving like robots
and one hand on the hip.

731
00:42:44,900 --> 00:42:49,110
I feel like they hit him, hit him.
They don't bitch is where the line,

732
00:42:49,190 --> 00:42:53,850
they just dropped that belt in their head,
dude. How about just yet? That it Dick,

733
00:42:54,070 --> 00:42:57,110
how US clunk cop out. I'm uh, doing, uh,

734
00:42:57,140 --> 00:42:59,990
before the Wayne's I'm doing a pretty
fight show and Floyd Mayweather.

735
00:42:59,991 --> 00:43:03,350
Seniors standing to my right gun.
You don't know shit.

736
00:43:03,650 --> 00:43:06,350
You don't know what the hell are you
talking about? Shop? You don't know shit.

737
00:43:06,500 --> 00:43:07,640
And I'm like trying to get through it,

738
00:43:07,641 --> 00:43:11,810
not pay attention to them
that stop playing, Bro. What
are you doing? Come on man.

739
00:43:11,870 --> 00:43:14,120
What are you doing?
I'm selling the fight and clicking.

740
00:43:14,210 --> 00:43:16,340
I'm putting money in your son's pocket,
man.

741
00:43:16,790 --> 00:43:20,270
You need someone up here to talk about
it. What are you doing? It just cause I,

742
00:43:20,271 --> 00:43:24,890
you know, when you're talking about
like Jesus Christ, man, relax. Yeah,

743
00:43:24,891 --> 00:43:29,210
he's a smooth talker.
That senior. Yeah. Yeah.

744
00:43:29,840 --> 00:43:31,860
Real smooth. It's like, yeah.

745
00:43:31,861 --> 00:43:36,020
I imagine if you're Floyd and you
like literally see your future,

746
00:43:36,021 --> 00:43:39,860
if you keep getting hit in the head like
right in front of me. Yeah. Heavy stuff.

747
00:43:39,970 --> 00:43:43,040
I mean that's gotta be one of the reasons
why he's so brilliant defensively.

748
00:43:43,041 --> 00:43:44,540
Not just cause he learned from his dad.

749
00:43:44,720 --> 00:43:47,240
He learned from Roger Mayweather and all
the people in the gym that he trained

750
00:43:47,241 --> 00:43:47,780
with,

751
00:43:47,780 --> 00:43:52,780
but also he sees the effects of come
Shannon punishment and his brother or his

752
00:43:52,851 --> 00:43:55,210
uncle rather as well. Yeah. Brought
Germaine. Whether there's, you know,

753
00:43:55,220 --> 00:43:58,490
he's not doing well, you
know, none of them are doing
great man. We're doing great.

754
00:43:58,491 --> 00:44:03,050
He's perfect though. 40 years
old, speak perfect, sharp,

755
00:44:03,051 --> 00:44:06,950
knows everything about it and everything
and they thought that Javante Davis,

756
00:44:07,190 --> 00:44:10,250
oh I didn't see you were doing it.
You saw yesterday,

757
00:44:11,090 --> 00:44:14,540
he's a kid who they thought was going to
be the next paper you king and you can

758
00:44:14,541 --> 00:44:17,780
tell athlete and he's just like,
he's missing a few things. He goes,

759
00:44:17,781 --> 00:44:22,130
because you just can't be 30 and old
with 30 knockouts and expect to be a mega

760
00:44:22,131 --> 00:44:25,490
star. You have to have everything he's
like, so he has to work on so much more.

761
00:44:25,491 --> 00:44:29,300
I don't know. And he's
130 pounds. It's tough.

762
00:44:29,900 --> 00:44:33,630
His weight, he missed weight, but he took
the fine short notice. He missed weight,

763
00:44:33,631 --> 00:44:35,820
had a horrible fight short notice,

764
00:44:36,190 --> 00:44:40,290
I want to say took it on to cause that I
think Sean Porter supposed to fight and

765
00:44:40,291 --> 00:44:44,220
then he backed out. So then they booked
this dude. He's fun to watch though.

766
00:44:44,280 --> 00:44:47,820
He has the most intense tattoo I've ever
seen. What is it? It's done. It's for him.

767
00:44:47,821 --> 00:44:51,560
He's from like the straight hood of
uh, Baltimore. And as he's talking,

768
00:44:51,570 --> 00:44:55,980
I looked down at the stir up people's
tattoos and it was a apartment building.

769
00:44:56,130 --> 00:44:59,940
Brick building on fire in front of
apartment building is a mass burglar.

770
00:44:59,941 --> 00:45:03,300
Black burglar would like the old school
rubber mask on with a bag of money and

771
00:45:03,301 --> 00:45:07,260
the gun. Why? Yeah, I was like,
shout out to that terrible tattoo.

772
00:45:07,830 --> 00:45:11,340
Jesus. He had a bad fight though.
And that was kind of his, you know,

773
00:45:11,341 --> 00:45:15,090
his platform to do something, but I don't
see him being the next like big thing.

774
00:45:15,210 --> 00:45:19,260
Yeah. He can tell Floyd too is
like, mm hmm. Before he's like,

775
00:45:19,261 --> 00:45:20,640
this is the next up and coming guy.

776
00:45:20,760 --> 00:45:23,880
He's a nice Floyd Mayweather and now I'm
like, he's, he's the next 40 million.

777
00:45:23,881 --> 00:45:26,610
He's like, hmm. Not really. No.

778
00:45:28,680 --> 00:45:31,920
He had a rough fight too.
Yeah, it was a rough fight.

779
00:45:31,921 --> 00:45:36,000
He clipped that dude behind the ear or
behind the head, but that's just like,

780
00:45:36,030 --> 00:45:39,570
we're punches land where people duck
is sometimes shit happens and you know,

781
00:45:39,571 --> 00:45:41,340
the guy was complaining about it.
He went down.

782
00:45:41,940 --> 00:45:43,410
I'll tell you what was
cool is after the fight,

783
00:45:43,411 --> 00:45:48,020
I'm in the back and I see American,
Terrence Crawford and uh,

784
00:45:48,270 --> 00:45:49,110
Andre Berto.

785
00:45:49,440 --> 00:45:54,440
And so I go to talk them and they were
all like super complimentary of Conor

786
00:45:54,600 --> 00:45:58,800
Mcgregor. Like, dude, he getting box, man.
I'm like, ride like, what'd you think?

787
00:45:58,801 --> 00:46:02,140
You're just going to go in there, look
like an asshole like Bart Simpson and fly.

788
00:46:02,270 --> 00:46:04,710
I was like this, like, what'd
you expect to happen? Like,

789
00:46:04,711 --> 00:46:06,300
we just didn't expect
him to get any rounds.

790
00:46:06,301 --> 00:46:09,300
We thought it was just gonna be out
class. I'm like, Nah man, he looked,

791
00:46:09,870 --> 00:46:14,870
he has tremendous belief in himself and
he had a weird style that that's strange

792
00:46:15,001 --> 00:46:19,140
style of offspeed punches extending his
arms fully and then pop them in there

793
00:46:19,320 --> 00:46:21,840
and Paul in the backroom,
Polly goes, I gotta be honest.

794
00:46:21,840 --> 00:46:25,230
I was kind of glad to see that cause when
I went and against him like the first

795
00:46:25,380 --> 00:46:29,100
four or five rounds, I couldn't land shit
cause that style, like it takes forever.

796
00:46:29,101 --> 00:46:31,380
Just get used to it. I didn't
know what to do. He's like,

797
00:46:31,381 --> 00:46:34,710
so I just thought maybe I was having
an off day. But once I see that,

798
00:46:34,770 --> 00:46:37,080
I see Floyd do this kind of
the same thing. You know?

799
00:46:37,380 --> 00:46:40,410
Granted Floyd fly to different
style. I don't give a shit. Yeah,

800
00:46:40,411 --> 00:46:45,210
that style is legit. It's legit. You
know? I mean that's just too big a leap.

801
00:46:45,270 --> 00:46:46,103
That's all it is.

802
00:46:46,210 --> 00:46:50,490
Hope for Connor to go and his first
professional fight fight arguably the

803
00:46:50,491 --> 00:46:54,030
greatest fighter of all time.
It's like he's 100% in the mix now.

804
00:46:54,120 --> 00:46:59,100
At d and o get 50 and now it's 100% in
the mix that he's the greatest fighter of

805
00:46:59,101 --> 00:47:02,160
all time. You think about
defensively, no one's even close.

806
00:47:02,190 --> 00:47:05,750
No one has been hit as little
as him and honor him. Yeah.

807
00:47:05,760 --> 00:47:09,180
I used to beat everybody and obviously
fought Conor different way than he fired

808
00:47:09,181 --> 00:47:10,320
everybody else.
That's a fact.

809
00:47:10,530 --> 00:47:15,530
But he'd kind of hit it more than any
fighter that every huge Kudos to Conor and

810
00:47:16,470 --> 00:47:17,310
Floyd,
but especially Connor.

811
00:47:17,520 --> 00:47:20,610
When's the last time you saw an
exciting Floyd Mayweather fight?

812
00:47:20,790 --> 00:47:24,570
True Condo went at him. Yeah. That's when
we kind of acid the fight. I made them,

813
00:47:24,600 --> 00:47:27,780
I turned them into a Mexican. Oh, that's
hilarious. Do you say that like, yeah,

814
00:47:27,840 --> 00:47:30,000
he didn't know that.
No condom. I miss a lot

815
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:30,130
of,

816
00:47:30,130 --> 00:47:34,270
Connor brought the fight out of them for
the first time since I don't know who

817
00:47:35,340 --> 00:47:37,780
you can say, well, let's finish
was Victor Ortiz? That was shit.

818
00:47:37,781 --> 00:47:39,970
That was kind of a cheap shot.
You didn't really didn't bring it to him,

819
00:47:39,971 --> 00:47:43,420
but just daughter brought it out of him
and this was legit. It was cool, man.

820
00:47:43,450 --> 00:47:46,750
And when I watched it the second time,
knowing the result,

821
00:47:46,900 --> 00:47:50,500
then you really appreciate what Floyd's
doing because although Connor did catch

822
00:47:50,501 --> 00:47:50,720
him,

823
00:47:50,720 --> 00:47:53,630
he definitely caught him with a heart
upper cut in the first round that's shut.

824
00:47:53,631 --> 00:47:56,680
Yeah. That was interesting
because that was like, oh shit.

825
00:47:56,681 --> 00:48:01,240
Like you got to realize mind your p's and
q's. This guy's legit. But Conor never,

826
00:48:01,280 --> 00:48:02,590
even though he clipped him with that shot,

827
00:48:02,591 --> 00:48:04,900
it never really heard them
except the one shot to the body.

828
00:48:04,901 --> 00:48:07,630
Which I was surprised.
I got to be honest in my prediction.

829
00:48:07,630 --> 00:48:10,470
I thought Connor was gonna do well
like you did in the first rounds.

830
00:48:10,480 --> 00:48:11,313
I called that.

831
00:48:11,320 --> 00:48:14,510
I thought he was gonna run four to five
rounds and then I thought he would want,

832
00:48:14,530 --> 00:48:17,610
I thought maybe that Upper
Cup would wobble them and
that would be enough to win

833
00:48:17,611 --> 00:48:20,640
Connor kind of the
spectacle but just it Kinda,

834
00:48:20,680 --> 00:48:24,580
you know Floyd's Chin and you know just
the boxing power's a little different

835
00:48:24,581 --> 00:48:27,340
man. It definitely is different. And I
don't think Conor is loading up either.

836
00:48:27,580 --> 00:48:27,791
You know,

837
00:48:27,791 --> 00:48:31,870
I don't think Conor is a really like
digging in on these shots cause I think he

838
00:48:31,871 --> 00:48:33,940
was probably concerned
about his endurance.

839
00:48:34,300 --> 00:48:37,720
You've got to realize also this
fight was relatively short notice.

840
00:48:37,840 --> 00:48:42,370
So short notice that I had already booked
the DC Improv in advance and it was

841
00:48:42,371 --> 00:48:44,890
sold out by the time they
announced the fight. Correct.

842
00:48:44,920 --> 00:48:47,770
So are not the DCM Prov that
the Warner theater in DC.

843
00:48:47,950 --> 00:48:51,940
So if you think about that,
that's fucking months in advance.

844
00:48:51,941 --> 00:48:55,240
Three months they did this
fight was announced three
months ago. That's nothing.

845
00:48:55,241 --> 00:48:57,310
That's nothing for this man.
Not to do have a fight.

846
00:48:57,700 --> 00:49:01,940
Most of the time a fight like this
is six, seven months out. Oh my God.

847
00:49:02,060 --> 00:49:05,440
They'd be more, when did they announce
Canelo triple down a long time in a while.

848
00:49:05,560 --> 00:49:08,290
I think between the time they announced
it and then when the fight starts,

849
00:49:08,291 --> 00:49:11,530
I got to feel like it's five months
at least. At least. Which is norm,

850
00:49:11,531 --> 00:49:14,260
I would assume. But, but at
least they, but they also,

851
00:49:14,320 --> 00:49:19,090
boxing was smart because they set it up.
Right. So the at Canelo is a Chavez Jr.

852
00:49:19,130 --> 00:49:20,020
That was a joke,

853
00:49:20,021 --> 00:49:24,160
but that was literally just a setup to
get him to trip to triple g and they both

854
00:49:24,161 --> 00:49:27,700
knew it. So you're looking at basically
a year in the making and before that,

855
00:49:27,760 --> 00:49:28,990
what two years in the making.

856
00:49:29,110 --> 00:49:32,930
And here's more importantly during
that entire time they're both box.

857
00:49:33,990 --> 00:49:34,790
Connor's not,

858
00:49:34,790 --> 00:49:38,080
I mean he's not really sure if he's
going to actually have this boxing match

859
00:49:38,081 --> 00:49:39,010
with Floyd Mayweather it.
Right.

860
00:49:39,011 --> 00:49:42,940
So he knocks out Eddie Alvarez
and then somehow or another,

861
00:49:42,941 --> 00:49:47,440
the rumblings get started. But that's
just not enough time. Well, did you,

862
00:49:47,470 --> 00:49:51,010
did you hear lunch to prepare for Floyd?
I agree. Especially in that arena.

863
00:49:51,011 --> 00:49:55,150
The best of all time in that
different arena. Floyd goes, listen,

864
00:49:55,180 --> 00:49:58,990
I tried making this fight before this and
the, you'll turned it down and he goes,

865
00:49:58,991 --> 00:50:02,470
I will see what happens. And then he
goes, then I came back and was like, Yo,

866
00:50:02,590 --> 00:50:05,140
this how much money we could make. He
goes, and then they were like, all right,

867
00:50:05,141 --> 00:50:07,540
let's do it. He goes, but I tried
making this fight a while ago.

868
00:50:07,541 --> 00:50:10,030
But even before this, yeah,
I remember the discussions,

869
00:50:10,240 --> 00:50:14,260
but to be the be that close, like
when they actually announced it. Okay,

870
00:50:14,261 --> 00:50:17,860
this is actually happening. Crazy.
It's crazy to have it so quickly.

871
00:50:17,970 --> 00:50:22,000
Especially this man to have a fight. Yeah,
it's nuts. So if something like that,

872
00:50:22,330 --> 00:50:25,150
if you gave Connor like six months,

873
00:50:25,570 --> 00:50:28,610
maybe he could get in better
shape where he could survive.

874
00:50:28,611 --> 00:50:30,140
He's always going to fit.
He's,

875
00:50:30,350 --> 00:50:32,800
he's never going to be
against a guy like Mayweather.

876
00:50:32,870 --> 00:50:35,690
It was so efficient and
his movement is so crisp.

877
00:50:35,691 --> 00:50:38,420
And this is how I was describing
it to a friend of mine. I was like,

878
00:50:38,450 --> 00:50:41,180
does your friend have all boxing or
martial arts background any fast?

879
00:50:41,330 --> 00:50:44,840
He was trying to figure out like why he
would get so tired. Gotcha. And I said,

880
00:50:45,440 --> 00:50:48,290
I go, okay, when you tie
your shoe, you tie your shoe.

881
00:50:48,291 --> 00:50:50,540
You don't even think about it.
He just called right now.

882
00:50:50,541 --> 00:50:52,730
But if you have to think
about tying your shoes,

883
00:50:52,880 --> 00:50:55,220
it takes more energy so you don't want it.
And you have to think.

884
00:50:55,310 --> 00:50:59,630
And then you've got your
tents. I go Floyd's just tying
the shoes. He's reacting.

885
00:50:59,631 --> 00:51:02,030
Yeah. He's just so, he's so good.

886
00:51:02,120 --> 00:51:06,350
He's been doing it so long that he's
just got it ingrained in his movements.

887
00:51:06,351 --> 00:51:08,840
Connor has to think way
more than Floyd does.

888
00:51:09,080 --> 00:51:12,830
And Floyd is constantly pressuring them.
So cars backing up all the time,

889
00:51:12,831 --> 00:51:15,840
which wears you out. And also
the, the volume of punches.

890
00:51:16,130 --> 00:51:17,870
He set a really high pace.
He thought,

891
00:51:17,871 --> 00:51:20,560
I think he thought he was gonna be able
to stop them. Well, maybe a little more.

892
00:51:20,740 --> 00:51:23,570
Stop him from coming forward. He
wasn't prepared when, you know,

893
00:51:23,571 --> 00:51:27,680
when Floyd put his head in his chest and
did work the raft and allow him to get

894
00:51:27,681 --> 00:51:30,560
his rest in the clench. But
listen, at the end of the day,

895
00:51:30,561 --> 00:51:33,680
I'm all about the glitch in the Matrix,
man. I think Connor's is a glitch.

896
00:51:33,710 --> 00:51:36,980
It was so much fun that even
pulled this off. It's awesome.

897
00:51:37,250 --> 00:51:41,660
He didn't dishonor the sport. I thought
he did really well. Um, the only,

898
00:51:41,900 --> 00:51:45,890
I told colonics and I'm proud of you,
man. What he did. We win or lose.

899
00:51:46,300 --> 00:51:51,230
This is not, his belief in himself is
incredible, but even that is not enough.

900
00:51:51,260 --> 00:51:53,930
If you find a better boxer
and your body gets tired.

901
00:51:54,110 --> 00:51:56,720
So that's what we saw in that fight
in the beginning of the fight.

902
00:51:56,930 --> 00:51:59,480
If he could have maintained
somehow or another,

903
00:51:59,630 --> 00:52:03,020
if he was in good enough shape that he
could maintain the pace that he had.

904
00:52:03,620 --> 00:52:06,650
He had in the first three rounds
for the entire 12 you had a fight.

905
00:52:06,680 --> 00:52:10,970
It's a well a way different fight
because he's dangerous. He's quick,

906
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:14,150
he's moving away.
He has a huge endurance problem.

907
00:52:14,360 --> 00:52:17,540
And this is like something
that comes back to for boxing.

908
00:52:17,900 --> 00:52:21,110
Obviously you don't think he has
insurance prime in UFC as well. He May.

909
00:52:21,200 --> 00:52:24,610
Cause if you look at his
[inaudible] Nate Diaz fight the,

910
00:52:24,910 --> 00:52:28,520
I went five rounds the first fine.
Yeah. But if you look at his attributes,

911
00:52:28,521 --> 00:52:31,970
that same durance is, you
know, and everyone knows
I'm a counter, a Dick Rider.

912
00:52:31,971 --> 00:52:34,960
But if you go on,
you know his strengths I,

913
00:52:35,030 --> 00:52:39,080
I'd say it's at the bottom as far as
his strengths. I agree it's not bad.

914
00:52:39,081 --> 00:52:41,570
Where it's like, you know, it's
not good. It's not good. Look,

915
00:52:41,960 --> 00:52:45,860
here's the best endurance in the sport.
Mighty mouse for sure. He doesn't count.

916
00:52:45,890 --> 00:52:49,310
He's out. True. You're 125 pounds.
You're out. Cain Velasquez counts.

917
00:52:49,580 --> 00:52:53,330
Cain Velasquez did count cats at the,
at the height of his career. You know,

918
00:52:53,331 --> 00:52:56,780
who else has phenomenal cardio and Neil
Magni, no magnet. You don't mind me?

919
00:52:56,781 --> 00:53:00,870
The Gazelle has some
phenomenal, phenomenal cardio,
uh, amazing pace. Sodas. A,

920
00:53:00,871 --> 00:53:04,670
you look at guys, you know Jon Jones
has gift card. Very good cardio. Yeah.

921
00:53:04,780 --> 00:53:07,560
Might be BPO. We'll figure it out. I
was on and we need to talk about that.

922
00:53:08,510 --> 00:53:12,450
You can't trust anything.
I'll just pointing. Was that
how disappointed he was?

923
00:53:12,451 --> 00:53:17,000
That broke my heart. John Jones.
Dude, you broke my heart, dude. Jamie.

924
00:53:17,030 --> 00:53:20,720
Jamie sent it to me. I was at a
universal, my wife and my kids,

925
00:53:20,760 --> 00:53:25,650
I had no doubt was texting you because
what was I doing? Uh, I forget.

926
00:53:25,740 --> 00:53:26,010
Oh,
I

927
00:53:26,010 --> 00:53:30,250
think, oh, I was working in for showtime
and I have my phone and then I, I look at,

928
00:53:30,270 --> 00:53:34,350
I have 70 miss tax and 23 minutes called
like, what the fuck happened? I'm like,

929
00:53:34,351 --> 00:53:38,780
someone died who died? And I look,
it's like John Jones, like, ah.

930
00:53:39,230 --> 00:53:42,570
So when as well with the hi Jamie sent
to me. I thought it was a show. Me Too.

931
00:53:42,571 --> 00:53:45,090
I thought the people were messing with
me. I looked at my phone, I was like,

932
00:53:45,091 --> 00:53:48,090
this is, and then you sent to me that
you're the first one it takes. I'm like,

933
00:53:48,120 --> 00:53:53,070
is this real? You went, yes. Well Ron, my
heart, John Snow. Once you start talking,

934
00:53:53,730 --> 00:53:57,700
once he started talking back and forth
with the golden snitch that go on Snitch,

935
00:53:58,120 --> 00:54:00,420
there's zero jokes there.
And listen,

936
00:54:00,421 --> 00:54:02,070
when the golden snitch
comes out with something,

937
00:54:02,520 --> 00:54:06,220
they've brand that pisser through
a ton of test. It's not like,

938
00:54:06,600 --> 00:54:11,190
it's not fake news. His was
plastered shit. Apparently a court,

939
00:54:11,220 --> 00:54:14,820
well, hold on. I can't, I don't think
I can say this because I had an expert.

940
00:54:14,821 --> 00:54:19,350
I talked with an expert about this drug
and he fucking dropped some knowledge on,

941
00:54:19,370 --> 00:54:22,290
okay, this is what I've
heard. This may not,

942
00:54:22,291 --> 00:54:25,260
may or may not be true because this is
the reason why I don't tell you to say

943
00:54:25,261 --> 00:54:27,780
this cause I'm, I'm
not, I'm not 100% aware.

944
00:54:27,810 --> 00:54:29,790
Maybe we can find some
information online available.

945
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:35,000
What I had heard is that this
drug is not detectable in blood.

946
00:54:35,880 --> 00:54:39,600
That it's a drug that's detectable in
urine and they have to in a new test,

947
00:54:39,720 --> 00:54:41,280
right? The test, they said a new test.

948
00:54:41,640 --> 00:54:45,910
What from what I heard too is the
Usada is they have a new test,

949
00:54:45,911 --> 00:54:48,030
obviously the only announcing,
hey we're doing this now.

950
00:54:48,030 --> 00:54:51,940
Everyone welcome to the party.
And this drug was also, it's,

951
00:54:51,990 --> 00:54:56,670
it's very common around power lifters
cause you can use in competition and by

952
00:54:56,671 --> 00:55:00,470
the time you get tested after
it has, uh, hours, a half life.

953
00:55:00,690 --> 00:55:04,740
So the shelf life is super short but you
take it and makes you super aggro and

954
00:55:04,741 --> 00:55:09,510
strong. So it they, and they go,
it's so hard to obtain legally.

955
00:55:09,840 --> 00:55:12,990
Most everyone gets a black market.
And when you get a black market,

956
00:55:12,991 --> 00:55:15,440
you don't know where it's coming from.
And a lot of time,

957
00:55:15,441 --> 00:55:17,310
and this happens with a lot of
power lifters in their athletes,

958
00:55:17,311 --> 00:55:18,450
when they test hot for this,

959
00:55:18,590 --> 00:55:22,420
it's because they got a bad batch
or something else mixed into it. Oh,

960
00:55:22,690 --> 00:55:26,400
this is gone from my super
knowledgeable dude who knows about it.

961
00:55:26,810 --> 00:55:29,740
It makes you angry or Oha confident.
Passive.

962
00:55:31,700 --> 00:55:34,980
And it goes in it. It lasts maybe
an hour, maybe two hours Max.

963
00:55:35,130 --> 00:55:37,370
And that's how your
system, he goes, he goes,

964
00:55:37,380 --> 00:55:41,550
so that makes sense by someone would fail
directly after cause it no, no, no, no,

965
00:55:41,551 --> 00:55:46,500
no, no. He, he failed after the
weigh in. That's when he failed.

966
00:55:48,900 --> 00:55:52,700
This is after the weigh in? I don't
think so. Yeah. He sure. Yeah. Yeah.

967
00:55:52,770 --> 00:55:56,730
We'll either way. Yeah. Well
maybe it's like lingering.

968
00:55:56,810 --> 00:55:59,760
Well that's what he's saying. What
he's saying. He's saying, well,

969
00:55:59,761 --> 00:56:02,940
but also I heard that they would use
the new test to maybe someone gave him a

970
00:56:02,941 --> 00:56:06,810
tainted sandwich. Maybe some tainted Dick
Pills. Either way. He broke my heart.

971
00:56:07,020 --> 00:56:10,950
I'm off. I'm off the train. I'm off
the God damn train and I'm sick of the,

972
00:56:11,090 --> 00:56:14,610
we have no idea what happened. It was just
Dick Pills. I'm like, I'm out. I'm out.

973
00:56:14,670 --> 00:56:19,260
How dare you? Well, is he offering up any
possible scenario for what happened? No.

974
00:56:19,261 --> 00:56:24,010
He tweeted out like, this is when I find
out who my real friends are. Hashtag boy

975
00:56:24,010 --> 00:56:26,710
fuck that noise.
That sounds like you're feeling sorry.

976
00:56:26,740 --> 00:56:28,150
She's just ain't helping
you out of this one.

977
00:56:29,590 --> 00:56:34,000
So much to be grateful for the UFC
money, but yeah, that's good. Um, yeah,

978
00:56:34,220 --> 00:56:37,390
he's got a nice family. It's true.
Good friends. Hopefully whatever.

979
00:56:37,450 --> 00:56:41,830
Whatever the fuck is happening. But here's
the thing, man. They have a second fire.

980
00:56:41,831 --> 00:56:42,660
Joe,

981
00:56:42,660 --> 00:56:47,020
listen to it multiple times as much Sada
since the golden snitch has been around

982
00:56:47,021 --> 00:56:49,930
and he's a motherfucker. I liked the guy.
But if you're a fighter, motherfucker,

983
00:56:50,250 --> 00:56:54,700
well, hey, he's doing exactly what
he supposed to do. Kind of doing,

984
00:56:54,740 --> 00:56:57,100
staring with sport baseball first.

985
00:56:57,140 --> 00:56:59,800
Now you're hitting all the fighters are
ruining it because they know what the

986
00:56:59,801 --> 00:57:04,600
fucking parameters. I agree.
I agree. I don't look,

987
00:57:04,650 --> 00:57:07,960
look, here's the thing about this fight.
Do you think Dana's ever like God,

988
00:57:07,990 --> 00:57:10,930
what kind of testing was done for this
Floyd? Maybe with Conor McGregor fight

989
00:57:12,560 --> 00:57:15,580
those new lights. What did he at Brody?
I like where you're doing the place, man.

990
00:57:15,610 --> 00:57:18,810
You know what man? I like the curtains
right when I pulled the new studio,

991
00:57:18,820 --> 00:57:21,490
I'm gonna do the curtain.
Yeah, you should man. Uh, yeah,

992
00:57:21,491 --> 00:57:25,690
but Novitsky is a guy that you
don't want on your bad side. Oh No.

993
00:57:25,990 --> 00:57:29,650
But do you ever think days like Damn Bro,
relax me.

994
00:57:30,280 --> 00:57:31,113
But Jesus,

995
00:57:32,130 --> 00:57:34,510
they knew what they were getting into
and you know what they just decided,

996
00:57:34,511 --> 00:57:36,040
this is only one way
to clean up the sport.

997
00:57:36,200 --> 00:57:39,270
Bring in the guy who was the very best
to catching people for doing drugs. Bam,

998
00:57:39,300 --> 00:57:43,570
Bam, Bam. Did they do, and
here's the thing, Jon Jones,
since you sought us, come in,

999
00:57:43,690 --> 00:57:45,220
he's failed three out of four tests.

1000
00:57:45,460 --> 00:57:48,850
The only one he did a full on
was a copper OSP. Coke is coke,

1001
00:57:50,190 --> 00:57:55,060
coke is coke. Coke once.
Oh, so that's fine.

1002
00:57:55,830 --> 00:57:56,840
Oh,
coke,

1003
00:57:57,010 --> 00:58:01,570
you a few lines and just fucking
Vandelay Silva pride style. Just,

1004
00:58:02,830 --> 00:58:06,820
um, how can we can't drink like
a giant monster energy drink.

1005
00:58:06,880 --> 00:58:11,020
That's one of the sponsors APP cause
it's not coke because it's like Goddamn

1006
00:58:11,130 --> 00:58:14,920
turn can, have you ever done coke?
No. Haven't have you now? No.

1007
00:58:14,921 --> 00:58:16,220
It's one of the few I know,

1008
00:58:18,230 --> 00:58:21,270
but I didn't do heroin but one
when I did get my knee operated on,

1009
00:58:21,280 --> 00:58:23,410
they had me on a drip on a,
I guess it was morphine,

1010
00:58:23,411 --> 00:58:25,880
morphine and I get to hit the
button every time you launch this.

1011
00:58:25,960 --> 00:58:29,590
And I would just, Bram was
firing her name. You I celebrate.

1012
00:58:30,310 --> 00:58:34,270
I guess they let you fire it into
a point where you can't die. Oh,

1013
00:58:34,271 --> 00:58:38,040
that's can't imagine you'd be able to
keep hitting that button and then dodge

1014
00:58:38,050 --> 00:58:39,830
that? No, they can't.
I remember, I wonder,

1015
00:58:39,840 --> 00:58:43,510
I wonder like what the limit is and how
many times. It depends who you are, right?

1016
00:58:43,630 --> 00:58:46,210
Because you probably have a high pain
tolerance for with your background,

1017
00:58:46,300 --> 00:58:47,680
but also I was bored.

1018
00:58:48,070 --> 00:58:51,660
So if I'm bored and you would give this
me this button and let's get [inaudible]

1019
00:58:52,980 --> 00:58:57,670
watching some terrible local television
show, the teaching channel. Oh,

1020
00:58:57,770 --> 00:59:00,420
I'm sure. We'll see. It's
super addicted. I'm sure. Yeah.

1021
00:59:00,421 --> 00:59:03,940
Someone gave me a bunch of
uh, these, these gummies,

1022
00:59:03,941 --> 00:59:07,450
these weed gummies and I can't rest it
and I'm always thinking about something.

1023
00:59:07,690 --> 00:59:11,530
So I took the weed gummy and Mars
attack was on, that shit was happening.

1024
00:59:11,890 --> 00:59:16,120
I've seen it so many times. It's, I feel
like it's always on late at night for me.

1025
00:59:16,470 --> 00:59:18,580
It's like my go to,
it's a great movie.

1026
00:59:18,790 --> 00:59:22,450
It is like a truly great movie,
right?

1027
00:59:22,700 --> 00:59:24,310
And it's so like silly,

1028
00:59:24,340 --> 00:59:28,040
like everything all done and
the cast is just phenomenal.

1029
00:59:28,640 --> 00:59:30,050
They want to Redo that.
I feel like,

1030
00:59:30,080 --> 00:59:32,750
didn't Jack Jack Nicholson played
two different people in that movie.

1031
00:59:32,751 --> 00:59:36,500
He played like the high roller, like
Vegas Guide and else played the president.

1032
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:41,540
Yes. Jim Brown's in that
movie. That's right.

1033
00:59:41,541 --> 00:59:45,170
Jim Brown's fucking everybody up plays
like a fucking alien up character.

1034
00:59:45,180 --> 00:59:45,640
Look at,

1035
00:59:45,640 --> 00:59:50,540
Tell Your Dad Jack Nicholson is the high
roller and then Martin Short's in it to

1036
00:59:50,660 --> 00:59:53,840
go get the fucking picture
of his body in Jesus Christ.

1037
00:59:53,841 --> 00:59:58,080
Look how cool the alien looks.
Thank God. They were awesome man.

1038
00:59:58,081 --> 01:00:00,930
Look at his clothes.
That was when the alien was the girl.

1039
01:00:01,050 --> 01:00:04,720
Remember he thought he's going to hit,
she was all hot. Yeah. And that was peers,

1040
01:00:06,180 --> 01:00:10,320
peers. Bronson was in it. Yes.
He was in it too. Am I crazy?

1041
01:00:12,010 --> 01:00:15,750
Ad and then remember his him and uh,
what's her name?

1042
01:00:17,040 --> 01:00:18,630
Whatever from sex and the city.

1043
01:00:18,870 --> 01:00:23,130
I remember her and him get their heads get
switched on to dots, right? Yes. Right.

1044
01:00:23,131 --> 01:00:27,480
They cut their heads off and put them on
dogs. What a fucking great movie. Oh Gee.

1045
01:00:27,510 --> 01:00:28,530
We were at Jack Black.

1046
01:00:28,770 --> 01:00:32,910
He had the military and he just runs
out and gets murked right away from the

1047
01:00:32,911 --> 01:00:37,470
family on TV. He's all,
fuck it. I'm going in.

1048
01:00:37,471 --> 01:00:40,680
Rushes in. There was so fun. See
if you could pull up just a video.

1049
01:00:40,681 --> 01:00:44,580
We could see them moving around.
I feel it. Especially for a 1996.

1050
01:00:44,640 --> 01:00:47,450
This was some Avatar Shit.
All my God.

1051
01:00:49,800 --> 01:00:51,910
Yeah, man. I did a, uh,

1052
01:00:51,911 --> 01:00:54,900
a movie or why was it that I did,

1053
01:00:55,410 --> 01:00:59,850
I did something with, one of the Gat
was Christina Applegate and that to, oh,

1054
01:00:59,851 --> 01:01:04,650
what's her name? Who was that girl? She
like it's, and that was the girl from, uh,

1055
01:01:04,670 --> 01:01:09,330
the big Lebowski. Tara Reid.
Wasn't that her? It's not her. Oh,

1056
01:01:09,331 --> 01:01:11,610
that was that. That was like the
yoga bitch who was all into it.

1057
01:01:13,250 --> 01:01:17,340
And remember shot releases the dose.
What's her name? Warren Beatty's wife.

1058
01:01:17,341 --> 01:01:19,680
Annette Bening. That's who
that is. That's that is,

1059
01:01:20,700 --> 01:01:22,990
that's that is here
come the power from all

1060
01:01:24,340 --> 01:01:28,100
good dude. Look at this. Not Be too rash.

1061
01:01:29,810 --> 01:01:34,810
Interested in the White House
to meet with a really broad

1062
01:01:38,130 --> 01:01:41,470
boom. It's an, that Benning
was with Jack Black.

1063
01:01:45,640 --> 01:01:48,170
Jack's a
shotgun.

1064
01:01:49,960 --> 01:01:54,960
Cultural misunderstanding about being
prepared for a few changes to what?

1065
01:01:56,050 --> 01:01:56,890
Oh,
what a great,

1066
01:02:26,070 --> 01:02:30,210
the marshy can teach us professor.
Quite a lot about

1067
01:02:31,900 --> 01:02:32,733
her.

1068
01:02:40,020 --> 01:02:42,850
I forgot about the giant robot.
Me To really,

1069
01:02:42,870 --> 01:02:47,790
grandma figures it out by music kills him.
Oh,

1070
01:02:47,791 --> 01:02:50,550
that's right. Spoiler alert.
The crazy ass grandma.

1071
01:02:52,380 --> 01:02:56,580
We all make mistakes. Mr President. I
remember they swallowed a nuclear bomb.

1072
01:02:56,640 --> 01:03:00,340
They like tried to Newco, man. They
landed a balloon then inhaled it.

1073
01:03:05,220 --> 01:03:08,790
Tim Burton, shout out to Tim. Tim
Burns a pirate. No backer. Hell yeah.

1074
01:03:08,791 --> 01:03:13,110
He's made some awesome movies
and they're always so weird too.

1075
01:03:13,111 --> 01:03:17,040
It's like what a crazy guy. He must
be. It must be up bat shit. Crazy.

1076
01:03:18,060 --> 01:03:20,070
That's right. He did pee
wee. Which one did he do?

1077
01:03:20,071 --> 01:03:24,800
The first one was the greatest
man. What time did Batman? He did.

1078
01:03:25,120 --> 01:03:27,960
He did the early Batman did to write it.
First of all,

1079
01:03:27,961 --> 01:03:32,310
he sold Michael Keaton as
Batman. Yeah, that's right.

1080
01:03:32,311 --> 01:03:34,020
Just about the joker movie
that they just announced.

1081
01:03:35,760 --> 01:03:36,560
He's not going to be in there.

1082
01:03:36,560 --> 01:03:40,790
Make a Martin Scorsese and Todd Phillips
or making a joke or a world stories.

1083
01:03:40,810 --> 01:03:42,690
That's my boy.
I thought Jared Leto.

1084
01:03:42,691 --> 01:03:45,650
Everybody loved him as a joke or not
going to be in this. No, but he has a d.

1085
01:03:45,690 --> 01:03:46,740
You're talking about two different ones,

1086
01:03:46,741 --> 01:03:48,720
so Jared loves doing a spin off joker too,

1087
01:03:48,750 --> 01:03:53,750
but this one my boy taught Feldman put
together with Todd Phillips and Martin

1088
01:03:54,270 --> 01:03:57,910
Scorsese, Scorsese, Saz, Jesus
Christ, speech impediment. Anyway,

1089
01:03:59,070 --> 01:04:02,310
the joker origin story on deck.
Todd Phillips got silver.

1090
01:04:02,311 --> 01:04:03,870
Martin Scorsese and it's dark.

1091
01:04:03,900 --> 01:04:08,900
It's like a dark joke or like how as
a kid he had like a permit smile and

1092
01:04:09,061 --> 01:04:11,550
everyone made fun of them and it's
like on the streets of Brooklyn,

1093
01:04:11,551 --> 01:04:14,550
it's like super dark, real. I can't wait.

1094
01:04:14,790 --> 01:04:17,160
Who's playing the joker and I
don't think they announced yet.

1095
01:04:17,850 --> 01:04:20,610
I'm going to make the announcement
hair. It's going to do it. Yeah. Right.

1096
01:04:21,810 --> 01:04:25,770
I can't wait to, I love that
stuff. A tricky role. Right?
Like Heath Ledger did it,

1097
01:04:26,270 --> 01:04:29,640
you know that's one of those roles were
like, Jack Nicholson did it. Ooh, cheers.

1098
01:04:29,641 --> 01:04:32,580
Levels killed it too.
They sit on set.

1099
01:04:32,581 --> 01:04:36,750
He would like send the cast like weird
shit in the mail. He went full joker.

1100
01:04:37,350 --> 01:04:40,580
He'd send him like dead rats in the mail.
I'm going to have to take, I'm like, Bro,

1101
01:04:40,800 --> 01:04:41,281
come on now.

1102
01:04:41,281 --> 01:04:44,310
I get the whole joke or thing that
in the mail send me like Gucci Cape.

1103
01:04:44,311 --> 01:04:47,430
You learn for God's sakes,
not the Goddamn snakes keeps sending.

1104
01:04:47,880 --> 01:04:52,800
He was in a movie that documents his
issues with a record company that Jamie,

1105
01:04:52,801 --> 01:04:56,360
you're always recommending. What's that
called again? If Jared veterans in it,

1106
01:04:56,430 --> 01:04:58,710
it's called the other day, I'll
look at Real Brooklyn. It's a,

1107
01:04:59,160 --> 01:05:03,810
it's something about, um, his band,
his band seconds for mark. Yeah.

1108
01:05:03,811 --> 01:05:07,260
They had some deal or are the record,
it's called artifact. Artifact.

1109
01:05:07,261 --> 01:05:08,310
That's the name of the documentary.

1110
01:05:08,580 --> 01:05:13,410
So he had some deal with a record company
and couldn't get out of it. And it was,

1111
01:05:13,530 --> 01:05:17,190
apparently they made a brutal
documentary about it and it got that,

1112
01:05:17,200 --> 01:05:19,030
won all these awards and on
that flight got to tell you,

1113
01:05:19,031 --> 01:05:23,230
I've gotta be honest with you. When I
see like awards in between those leaves,

1114
01:05:23,231 --> 01:05:24,910
when they write things in which we,
those leaves,

1115
01:05:25,450 --> 01:05:28,880
I ignore it cause it looks pretentious.
Frames.

1116
01:05:29,640 --> 01:05:31,420
I'll speak it.
It must be good.

1117
01:05:31,421 --> 01:05:35,440
Why do you have what you have to say
framed in between fern leaves is this

1118
01:05:35,441 --> 01:05:37,660
ancient Rome,
what the fuck are you doing?

1119
01:05:37,750 --> 01:05:40,930
Because this was this hieroglyphs
it doesn't work at all with me.

1120
01:05:41,180 --> 01:05:42,160
We're just the opposite.

1121
01:05:42,190 --> 01:05:44,650
It's like when I see a company that
says world's best coffee, I'm like,

1122
01:05:44,651 --> 01:05:46,380
I gotta try it on that.
You shouldn't.

1123
01:05:46,400 --> 01:05:49,930
You should start framing all your posters
that you send out for your Gig. Leaves.

1124
01:05:50,110 --> 01:05:53,000
Quotes about you. I'll make a quote.
You could put it in inside leaves.

1125
01:05:53,340 --> 01:05:57,610
I'll say he's fucking hilarious.
It's like you put it in between two least.

1126
01:05:59,260 --> 01:06:03,640
What am I funny as friends between two
palm leaves. Joe Says he's all right.

1127
01:06:03,641 --> 01:06:07,750
Get tickets here.
Why the fuck is with the palm leaves man?

1128
01:06:08,650 --> 01:06:13,360
Fishel stupid. Pull that back up again.
That shit looks stupid. God, I see that.

1129
01:06:13,361 --> 01:06:16,720
I'm like, this shit must be good. First
of all, why do they have five of them?

1130
01:06:16,721 --> 01:06:20,410
Get the fuck Outta here.
Kenn palm leaves cause that movies.

1131
01:06:21,130 --> 01:06:25,100
That's why does Jared lentils involved?
That's why no,

1132
01:06:25,210 --> 01:06:27,250
you get 10 palm leaves you took up on it.

1133
01:06:27,400 --> 01:06:31,150
Make those quotes bigger so I can
actually read in my reading glasses.

1134
01:06:31,930 --> 01:06:35,830
Look at much smaller. The quotes
are then the fucking, the subtitle.

1135
01:06:35,890 --> 01:06:38,920
It's a bunch of independent awards.

He just want to have your
shit and in palm leaves.

1143
01:07:04,630 --> 01:07:08,020
See that's exactly what I'm saying.
That's why they have the quote so small.

1144
01:07:08,080 --> 01:07:11,200
They're fucking with you shop and
he'd just eaten it up. Eat it up.

1145
01:07:11,550 --> 01:07:12,730
I'm going to go home and watch it.

1146
01:07:13,000 --> 01:07:15,320
Don't let them get you with
those goddamn leave shop.

1147
01:07:15,321 --> 01:07:19,090
They got me brother every time.
Every fucking time. I'm not,

1148
01:07:19,330 --> 01:07:22,210
I'm not impressed by leaves.
No.

1149
01:07:22,600 --> 01:07:26,510
How about one good quote from somebody
that I think I respect their opinion.

1150
01:07:26,640 --> 01:07:30,900
Legit act or like I enjoyed
this move and Martin Lawrence,

1151
01:07:35,990 --> 01:07:36,823
he

1152
01:07:39,010 --> 01:07:43,210
always taught the fucking record
business was shady. Kevin Hart.

1153
01:07:43,850 --> 01:07:48,040
Yeah, that'd be great. That'd
be great. Yeah. Selection.

1154
01:07:48,340 --> 01:07:51,380
What does that mean? You didn't win? Did
you win or did you not? When you want,

1155
01:07:51,460 --> 01:07:55,510
you want some cool awards and even win
that award. That's an official selection.

1156
01:07:55,810 --> 01:07:57,940
You get selected bitch.
That doesn't mean shit.

1157
01:07:58,810 --> 01:08:02,800
Can't put that inside of palm leaves.
Hugger picked a date with that girl.

1158
01:08:02,830 --> 01:08:07,540
Did you fuck her? No, no. She selected me
to go the selected me. There's something,

1159
01:08:07,570 --> 01:08:10,420
I just, it just have Brock I brought up
because I just thought there's something

1160
01:08:10,421 --> 01:08:13,070
interesting about Jared Leto suits.
You guys think about the SA.

1161
01:08:13,330 --> 01:08:16,820
He's got a pseudonym that
he'd direct Sunder Savile

1162
01:08:16,870 --> 01:08:20,590
new co Cubans.
Cubans I think befallen me.

1163
01:08:20,600 --> 01:08:24,620
I just say you see it pop up from time
to time directed it. It's his name.

1164
01:08:24,830 --> 01:08:29,540
Oh that's smart. Cause he doesn't
want people to think about him.

1165
01:08:29,600 --> 01:08:32,610
He just wants them to think about
the de moving pig an easier name.

1166
01:08:32,670 --> 01:08:34,820
But can we just call him bart onset?
Barneys happens.

1167
01:08:34,960 --> 01:08:39,520
Maybe it was on like fucking
some shit. Dude. He did a,

1168
01:08:39,521 --> 01:08:43,610
the MTV awards last night before. Like
he's all, he's sponsored by Gucci.

1169
01:08:43,611 --> 01:08:47,270
Soy is like way too much. He has Gucci
scarf. Cape the class is all this shit on.

1170
01:08:47,300 --> 01:08:49,650
Just because they sell it doesn't
mean you have to wear it anyways.

1171
01:08:50,240 --> 01:08:51,410
So they're asking,

1172
01:08:51,470 --> 01:08:56,240
they're asking him about his appearance
and like his performance. He's like,

1173
01:08:56,600 --> 01:08:58,880
trust me.
You've never seen anything like this?

1174
01:08:58,881 --> 01:09:01,850
I don't want to give it away and how
much Jared little fan, I was like,

1175
01:09:01,851 --> 01:09:06,230
this can be some shit. This motherfucker
just did the PR. You mean the Predator?

1176
01:09:06,380 --> 01:09:10,510
He just did the night vision
Predator thing. Look at
this. Come on with the home.

1177
01:09:10,520 --> 01:09:15,080
Would he do, he just did the Predator
vision. We did this in the 90s

1178
01:09:16,610 --> 01:09:20,720
look, that's it. That's the whole video.
He was like, it's like some Avatar Shit.

1179
01:09:20,750 --> 01:09:23,090
You've never seen this before.
It's kids. First of all,

1180
01:09:23,091 --> 01:09:26,990
you're not really obsessed with this,
like he's obsessed with himself.

1181
01:09:27,020 --> 01:09:28,910
So that's part of the problem.
And then second of all,

1182
01:09:28,911 --> 01:09:30,380
you probably know the same drugs he's on,

1183
01:09:30,530 --> 01:09:32,120
but if you work go full screen with that.

1184
01:09:32,690 --> 01:09:34,480
I don't feel like you're
giving the full faculty.

1185
01:09:34,520 --> 01:09:37,460
You're talking about the Predator now.
It's a little bit more than that.

1186
01:09:37,810 --> 01:09:39,300
It's a little bit more than that.
It's kind of freaking out. Well,

1187
01:09:39,301 --> 01:09:41,380
that's kind of detailed. Kind
of like it. He's got a hat on.

1188
01:09:41,400 --> 01:09:43,790
You can see it through the hat.
It's not that creative though.

1189
01:09:43,791 --> 01:09:47,540
I feel like interesting that you
say this and he's a creative dude.

1190
01:09:47,840 --> 01:09:50,180
Maybe it's good.
Maybe if you're high on ecstasy,

1191
01:09:50,181 --> 01:09:52,880
this would be the best video
ever. Yeah, he might be right.

1192
01:09:53,240 --> 01:09:57,470
I don't know how much that
has to play into it too. Are
they good band? Yes. He's,

1193
01:09:57,520 --> 01:10:01,140
he's phenomenal. I've never literally
never heard their music. I like the,

1194
01:10:01,141 --> 01:10:05,990
you would know
they've been around since the late nine.

1195
01:10:05,991 --> 01:10:10,830
That boy can kind got a lot of kids behind
them. Well else people dancing on son.

1196
01:10:11,020 --> 01:10:14,300
I like the answers dude house.
If everywhere you went you had dancers

1197
01:10:16,040 --> 01:10:20,380
be kind of cool is bear.
You don't think that looks good now?

1198
01:10:20,630 --> 01:10:22,340
The hair has been due to,
how bout,

1199
01:10:22,370 --> 01:10:25,620
how bout this Joe Mtd fucked
up so bad and I love him too.

1200
01:10:25,640 --> 01:10:29,420
How would they fucked up? How about
cause Jared Leto toward, with Chester,

1201
01:10:29,450 --> 01:10:33,500
the guy commit suicide for Lincoln Park
and with the guy from uh, Soundgarden.

1202
01:10:33,530 --> 01:10:36,770
Who else commits suicide? He's
known him. Two of his best friends.

1203
01:10:36,950 --> 01:10:39,770
So they have him do an open
monologue for him, right? Yeah.

1204
01:10:39,810 --> 01:10:43,340
Like just tell him like how great they
were and he goes, all right. Uh, let's,

1205
01:10:43,490 --> 01:10:45,140
let's cut to the last time.

1206
01:10:45,141 --> 01:10:48,590
Chester performed on stage here and
they're like on top of Hollywood and he's

1207
01:10:48,591 --> 01:10:52,520
singing and MTV cuts the new Mintos.
Gav,

1208
01:10:52,521 --> 01:10:55,460
you had your meant fresh
breath today and they cut.

1209
01:10:55,490 --> 01:11:00,320
They just cut it off and they come back
like let's, hey, it's Nikki Minaj his ass.

1210
01:11:00,530 --> 01:11:03,560
Yeah. They like did this whole
dedication to them and then halfway,

1211
01:11:03,590 --> 01:11:08,270
not even halfway me. 20 seconds to
performance. Cut It to commercial. Huh?

1212
01:11:09,680 --> 01:11:12,860
Is Rough. Why would they do that? I
don't know. When they play the full song.

1213
01:11:12,890 --> 01:11:14,220
I don't know.
People are so

1214
01:11:14,220 --> 01:11:18,090
upset. They thought was so disrespectful.
Send an accident. I don't know.

1215
01:11:18,091 --> 01:11:21,330
I don't think so. I think they're just
like, oh, we gotta cut the brake kit.

1216
01:11:21,331 --> 01:11:24,510
That meant those commercial
man. I, you know, look,

1217
01:11:24,780 --> 01:11:28,470
I'm very biased about this because I
don't interrupt podcasts with commercials,

1218
01:11:29,100 --> 01:11:34,100
but there's a big difference between like
watching shit on Netflix and watching

1219
01:11:34,190 --> 01:11:37,980
shit on regular TV or watching shit on
HBO and watching Shit on regular TV.

1220
01:11:38,010 --> 01:11:42,980
I don't watch commercials. The you get
brought out of the of the, like the,

1221
01:11:43,030 --> 01:11:45,540
the whole hypnotic
effect of seeing a show.

1222
01:11:45,570 --> 01:11:48,690
The breaks your focus a hundred percent
if game of Thrones at commercial,

1223
01:11:49,170 --> 01:11:51,240
there's sometimes the game
of Thrones I don't breathe.

1224
01:11:51,570 --> 01:11:56,160
Like when that red wedding, I was
like, oh dude, just after just wait,

1225
01:11:56,220 --> 01:11:59,580
this is shit happens
with certain said Dragon.

1226
01:12:00,510 --> 01:12:03,940
Try not to get so close to anyone
because everyone dies the fuck up.

1227
01:12:03,960 --> 01:12:07,090
You can't get close. They got close.
I cannot get some handling Polisi man.

1228
01:12:07,100 --> 01:12:10,440
I'm like, Oh Shush, Shush, Shush,
shush. We can't talk. You can't talk.

1229
01:12:10,920 --> 01:12:14,270
I can't say any slave. She's such
a, she's the mother of all drag.

1230
01:12:14,290 --> 01:12:16,860
I know she's not a slighter. She
never slay the dragons. That's true.

1231
01:12:16,861 --> 01:12:21,540
You know what I'm saying though? Yeah. To,
yeah. There's like interruptions in the,

1232
01:12:21,541 --> 01:12:25,770
in the, in the game of Thrones. It's like
I'm in the zone, man. I'm in the zone.

1233
01:12:26,580 --> 01:12:29,880
I tried to watch him walking dead once on
regular TV in real time and I was like,

1234
01:12:29,881 --> 01:12:32,250
I can't even do this.
I just flipped through all the chat.

1235
01:12:32,340 --> 01:12:33,480
As soon as commercial I flipped through,

1236
01:12:33,481 --> 01:12:34,990
I just record them so I
can fast forward through.

1237
01:12:35,130 --> 01:12:37,200
I don't get how they make
money off these ads anymore.

1238
01:12:37,560 --> 01:12:42,300
Well that's what my point is that this
is a very ineffective way to promote

1239
01:12:42,301 --> 01:12:44,610
things and I think it would
probably be a more effective way,

1240
01:12:44,611 --> 01:12:48,060
like think of all the ads they have
in a show, right? If all these shows,

1241
01:12:48,600 --> 01:12:50,380
wouldn't it be like me?

1242
01:12:50,610 --> 01:12:55,610
Way more effective if they had one
very good or two very good ads at the

1243
01:12:55,621 --> 01:12:59,760
beginning of the show and they say like
game of Thrones is brought to you by

1244
01:12:59,790 --> 01:13:02,730
boom, they do it. If you've
got to do that. I agree.

1245
01:13:02,850 --> 01:13:07,650
Having in the beginning and know that
this show sponsored this entire episode so

1246
01:13:07,651 --> 01:13:08,940
that the episode doesn't have to have,

1247
01:13:09,420 --> 01:13:12,930
that's just like they do that
business greedy. They do it, but yeah,

1248
01:13:12,931 --> 01:13:15,750
they want to do those 32nd spots to
get all that money for the network.

1249
01:13:15,770 --> 01:13:17,400
But the thing is like those breaks,

1250
01:13:17,460 --> 01:13:21,360
they ruined the art so they
make the creation worse,

1251
01:13:21,390 --> 01:13:26,130
so it makes it less valuable.
It makes it less valuable to sell ads on.

1252
01:13:26,250 --> 01:13:30,160
And also no one's watching them.
They know it's not going.

1253
01:13:30,210 --> 01:13:32,880
You're going to get a fraction of the
people watching them and a lot of people

1254
01:13:32,881 --> 01:13:35,150
are going to be upset by them.
I agree. And it does. It does.

1255
01:13:35,180 --> 01:13:38,370
They just don't work that
the advertisement agency,

1256
01:13:38,400 --> 01:13:39,330
you know that come around off,

1257
01:13:39,331 --> 01:13:43,260
see podcasts and cause if someone's going
to listen to your show for three hours

1258
01:13:43,261 --> 01:13:45,270
a day, you know, it's
just a different dynamic.

1259
01:13:45,271 --> 01:13:47,970
But you're also not up there
reading, you know, whatever.

1260
01:13:47,971 --> 01:13:49,830
Sponsor me on these we
have coming to me undies.

1261
01:13:49,950 --> 01:13:53,060
You're reading in the middle of like,
if you're like, hold on Britain,

1262
01:13:53,070 --> 01:13:54,990
let me do this real quick.
A lot of people do do that.

1263
01:13:55,620 --> 01:13:57,600
I just don't think it's the
right way to do it anymore.

1264
01:13:57,601 --> 01:14:00,330
I just think the only reason why we're
doing it that way is because everybody

1265
01:14:00,331 --> 01:14:02,940
always did it that way before.
That's how you saw it on television.

1266
01:14:02,941 --> 01:14:06,090
That's how you heard it on the radio.
They always interrupted for these ads.

1267
01:14:06,570 --> 01:14:09,420
I don't think that's the
most effective way to do ads.

1268
01:14:09,420 --> 01:14:12,430
I just think that we got used to doing
it that I think it upsets people.

1269
01:14:12,490 --> 01:14:14,650
Definitely does. I think it turns
people off where they're like,

1270
01:14:14,651 --> 01:14:16,660
fuck that product. You know
when people used to say, well,

1271
01:14:16,661 --> 01:14:17,980
what if someone has to
get up to take a leak?

1272
01:14:18,160 --> 01:14:20,470
Well do you don't have to do that anymore?
You can pause things now.

1273
01:14:20,680 --> 01:14:22,180
You can watch HBO on pause it.

1274
01:14:22,181 --> 01:14:26,590
I mean we have different control over
media now and ultimately we're going to

1275
01:14:26,591 --> 01:14:30,010
get to a point where you can watch
things almost everything's going to be on

1276
01:14:30,011 --> 01:14:32,890
demand the way Netflix does it.
That's the future. It's the future.

1277
01:14:32,920 --> 01:14:37,570
Imagine what donut comedy central
special and there's commercials to your

1278
01:14:37,571 --> 01:14:41,150
special.
That's where mine was my last special.

1279
01:14:41,240 --> 01:14:46,240
I had a break it up and they edited it
for commercials and I even like recorded

1280
01:14:46,361 --> 01:14:48,940
it for commercials. Like I knew
that it was going to be 44 minutes.

1281
01:14:49,360 --> 01:14:53,350
I had to do it during this constraint
and these were when we're going to drop

1282
01:14:53,351 --> 01:14:56,020
things and so it had to
make sense when you shut,

1283
01:14:56,140 --> 01:14:59,830
shut it off and then went to commercial.
It's very complicated to edit that way.

1284
01:15:00,220 --> 01:15:04,570
It's tough enough as it is. Yeah. And it
does, it's not good to watch it that way.

1285
01:15:04,630 --> 01:15:07,120
It's just not me.
It's better than not watching it at all.

1286
01:15:07,510 --> 01:15:10,210
But the best way to watch
something is all the way through.

1287
01:15:10,300 --> 01:15:13,760
But here's the question is say if
you're a company, right? Like, uh,

1288
01:15:13,900 --> 01:15:17,770
outside of podcasts, which are pretty
easy, just do the ads in the beginning.

1289
01:15:18,730 --> 01:15:22,900
How do you, how do you sell things
now? Like say if you're, you know,

1290
01:15:22,901 --> 01:15:27,670
pick a product. If you're mentos
Mentos to fucking night, I, uh,

1291
01:15:27,790 --> 01:15:28,240
I,
uh,

1292
01:15:28,240 --> 01:15:32,320
sponsor that show and I pay enough where
they don't need the other ad revenue

1293
01:15:32,321 --> 01:15:35,500
and I get at the beginning and the end.
But is it worth it for them?

1294
01:15:35,530 --> 01:15:37,820
Because that's a tangible
amount of money, right? If,

1295
01:15:37,830 --> 01:15:40,600
if you're going to have one
sponsor for the entire show,

1296
01:15:40,890 --> 01:15:44,180
think of how many sponsors the video
music awards must have. Like, yeah,

1297
01:15:44,181 --> 01:15:46,120
it doesn't,
how many of them don't do this?

1298
01:15:46,121 --> 01:15:49,390
Performance is brought to you by Pepsi.
And then they hit it, you know, which is,

1299
01:15:49,600 --> 01:15:54,070
which is almost better than doing
a full Pepsi commercial gas.

1300
01:15:54,430 --> 01:15:56,400
I don't know. Still don't
want to hear it. Like what?

1301
01:15:56,410 --> 01:15:58,690
How do you advertise something
without interrupting?

1302
01:15:58,691 --> 01:16:02,500
Something else has got to be a
way because it seems so sneaky,

1303
01:16:02,650 --> 01:16:05,780
but they've always done it this way.
You're watching something.

1304
01:16:05,810 --> 01:16:08,560
You don't want to hear the ad. You've
got to sit through the ad. All right.

1305
01:16:08,561 --> 01:16:11,290
All right. All right. Get back to what
I like and then you get back to it,

1306
01:16:11,470 --> 01:16:12,370
but I wonder if there,

1307
01:16:12,410 --> 01:16:15,280
they must be seeing a return because
otherwise they'd stop. Right.

1308
01:16:15,310 --> 01:16:16,330
Obviously I bet it's down,

1309
01:16:16,331 --> 01:16:20,770
but the advertising agency so big then
she's so big because who really watches

1310
01:16:20,771 --> 01:16:24,260
things live now besides sports,
like game of Thrones. I mean,

1311
01:16:24,261 --> 01:16:26,420
I'm in season four for God's sakes.
Came out years ago.

1312
01:16:26,430 --> 01:16:29,830
There's other shows like my other
shows, hard knocks HBO, no commercials.

1313
01:16:30,220 --> 01:16:32,740
I've just, I've, and if there's
commercials, I literally just,

1314
01:16:32,890 --> 01:16:36,190
I won't even see one who's really
sitting there when it's live.

1315
01:16:36,430 --> 01:16:39,910
I watch commercials on Hbo
for upcoming programs though.

1316
01:16:39,940 --> 01:16:42,130
Those aren't really commercials.
They're not selling you a product.

1317
01:16:42,131 --> 01:16:45,840
They're showing you other cool shit there.
Developer previews at the movie. Yeah,

1318
01:16:45,880 --> 01:16:48,370
I take that and here's some cool
shit you might want to watch.

1319
01:16:48,460 --> 01:16:51,400
You're not selling you anything.
Exactly. But even at AMC when they,

1320
01:16:51,430 --> 01:16:54,350
those delicious ice cold sodas
pop out, I'm like, you know what?

1321
01:16:54,400 --> 01:16:57,490
I might have to have one. Yeah,
but that's before the movies.

1322
01:16:57,491 --> 01:17:01,120
He price back that and they also have
that after they showed you a bunch of

1323
01:17:01,121 --> 01:17:02,820
really cool shit with the preview.

1324
01:17:02,860 --> 01:17:07,180
You've already got my approval or any
friends or if you get their real real

1325
01:17:07,181 --> 01:17:10,080
early, it's a slideshow.
All those are fucking

1326
01:17:10,240 --> 01:17:14,650
a loser. When are you going to start
showing me some things that lights are on?

1327
01:17:14,780 --> 01:17:18,260
Bright white screen and then it's
just like ag. Yeah, that's right.

1328
01:17:18,560 --> 01:17:21,740
It's like a local Italian restaurant.
Oh,

1329
01:17:21,880 --> 01:17:24,700
with the best bread in the
fucking things in between.

1330
01:17:24,730 --> 01:17:28,220
We'll call leaves or their awards
are in between leaves. Yeah.

1331
01:17:28,230 --> 01:17:31,130
It's just you and your buddy. Yeah. I
feel like it makes you feel like a loser.

1332
01:17:31,131 --> 01:17:33,660
Like, oh my God, we're
idiots right here so early.

1333
01:17:34,730 --> 01:17:37,610
You know there's a lot of these movie
theaters that are taken off that are in

1334
01:17:37,611 --> 01:17:41,690
places where you get assigned seating
and they sell booze and they bring real

1335
01:17:41,691 --> 01:17:45,860
food. That's what I do. There's a lot of
those now man. This ton of different ones.

1336
01:17:46,440 --> 01:17:49,430
Yeah, I pick you go there. It's
so nice. My so many of them now.

1337
01:17:49,431 --> 01:17:52,710
You don't have to like, it's good
food too. Like really good. Yeah.

1338
01:17:52,940 --> 01:17:55,070
Some dude was eating a
steak next me and shit.

1339
01:17:55,140 --> 01:17:58,580
Does that synopsis here we go to that one.
No arc lights good too.

1340
01:17:59,570 --> 01:18:02,060
There's some really good ones.
Well they figured it out man.

1341
01:18:02,061 --> 01:18:05,060
It's like the same thing that
airports have figured out. Hey,

1342
01:18:05,061 --> 01:18:06,890
we don't have to have only shitty food.

1343
01:18:07,010 --> 01:18:10,430
How about you have a nice
little restaurant right
here in the airport and they

1344
01:18:10,431 --> 01:18:14,540
started doing that with like Wolfgang
puck's at lax and then they have lemonade

1345
01:18:14,541 --> 01:18:17,870
salary. There's a lot of good stuff
at the airport now. Good coffee.

1346
01:18:18,020 --> 01:18:19,390
You can get real food.

1347
01:18:19,400 --> 01:18:23,270
San Francisco has like
straight up five course meals.

1348
01:18:23,640 --> 01:18:28,070
Real food. Dia has a chop
house. Steak House. Oh yeah.

1349
01:18:28,210 --> 01:18:32,330
Oh yeah. New York has a JFK, JFK,

1350
01:18:32,390 --> 01:18:36,330
some serious restaurants. Jason
Kilar, Italian food. Really killer.

1351
01:18:36,550 --> 01:18:40,680
Like really good. Some serious
shit. Yeah, there's everywhere.

1352
01:18:40,690 --> 01:18:42,820
Has figured that now. They're
like, look, we, you're,

1353
01:18:42,830 --> 01:18:45,620
you've got people coming in and out.
A lot of these people are business people.

1354
01:18:45,621 --> 01:18:48,890
Like people have money. Yeah. They
don't want to just eat McDonald's.

1355
01:18:49,190 --> 01:18:53,690
Even the plain foods getting better too.
They have an Asta Rhea and lax.

1356
01:18:53,691 --> 01:18:57,530
Now I know like a fame,
like a fancy schmancy little place.

1357
01:18:57,531 --> 01:19:01,310
We it with a tasting menu. I love
that shit. I'm getting hungry.

1358
01:19:01,430 --> 01:19:05,750
Let me tell you know, he's still sticking
to the Kito Diet. Uh, I went pescatarian.

1359
01:19:05,870 --> 01:19:08,870
Oh,
how dare you now just to mix it up.

1360
01:19:09,110 --> 01:19:13,520
How did keep forever and I'd go back to
it. I'm, I'm asking the 10 only fissured,

1361
01:19:13,570 --> 01:19:17,270
eat scallops and muscles to scalp
and muscles. I'm him lobster.

1362
01:19:18,050 --> 01:19:21,640
My huge lobster fan.
How dare I made some lobster.

1363
01:19:21,870 --> 01:19:24,650
Grilled it up real proper.
Like grilled it up.

1364
01:19:24,651 --> 01:19:28,090
Why don't you just throw it in the dirt
and let it get heated up with a son?

1365
01:19:28,130 --> 01:19:30,810
Grilled. Blockbuster. You don't? What
do you like? Your labs are boiled.

1366
01:19:30,890 --> 01:19:35,360
Boiled like a man. No, that's the JV.

1367
01:19:35,600 --> 01:19:39,230
See Grill, that thing.
I don't kill anything.

1368
01:19:39,440 --> 01:19:42,560
I just buy it from the
store tales. Fucking, Oh,

1369
01:19:42,561 --> 01:19:45,830
you're grilling blabbing for God's sakes.
Don't lobster tails.

1370
01:19:46,100 --> 01:19:50,870
Jesus Christ. What do you do? What
the hell? Fuck. And I'm alive.

1371
01:19:51,110 --> 01:19:55,040
Oh, fuck up. You get them live
from two. It's 2017 fucking.

1372
01:19:55,160 --> 01:19:57,260
What are you talking about?
Grocery stores have tanks.

1373
01:19:57,530 --> 01:20:00,110
You'd go to a grocery store.
Jamie,

1374
01:20:00,111 --> 01:20:02,930
what's the last time you saw
God damn lobster tank. They do.

1375
01:20:03,380 --> 01:20:08,100
You go to Ralph's or some shit and
maybe that the inhumane tank [inaudible]

1376
01:20:08,460 --> 01:20:12,450
to get out. Do they have it?
A lot of places? Yes. Listen,

1377
01:20:12,480 --> 01:20:13,950
I've seen that since I was a kid.

1378
01:20:14,030 --> 01:20:18,450
Have when a Gelson's right up the
street from here. You go there.

1379
01:20:18,570 --> 01:20:21,240
Does a tank of water scoop
up a fucking laugh, sir.

1380
01:20:21,241 --> 01:20:23,700
Until you give me that one right there.
It's about two pounds, sir. Okay,

1381
01:20:24,210 --> 01:20:27,120
we'll take that one. Oh, that's
a good one. Am I batshit crazy?

1382
01:20:27,121 --> 01:20:30,810
I haven't seen that in four. And you only
go to whole foods. That's why I'm fancy.

1383
01:20:30,840 --> 01:20:34,510
You don't fuck around your Amazon bought
whole foods here about that ratio,

1384
01:20:34,620 --> 01:20:37,930
change slashing prices and their stock.
As soon as they bought it went boom, boom,

1385
01:20:37,931 --> 01:20:42,400
boom, boom. They paid whatever,
12 billion. Here's what I
put up. 22 billion of that.

1386
01:20:42,420 --> 01:20:43,660
You want to make some money? Yeah, sure.

1387
01:20:43,690 --> 01:20:48,420
Get rid of this fucking people in the
parking lot that harass you when you're

1388
01:20:48,421 --> 01:20:50,940
walking out with a car,
you got ice cream.

1389
01:20:50,940 --> 01:20:53,280
It's 150 degrees outside and they're like,

1390
01:20:53,460 --> 01:20:57,900
can I have two minutes for gay rights
finger in front of your face? Like,

1391
01:20:57,901 --> 01:21:01,440
Hey, I hope man, I vote for gay rights.

1392
01:21:01,441 --> 01:21:05,820
You can't just get me your ambushing me
when I'm coming out with my fucking cold

1393
01:21:05,821 --> 01:21:09,600
food. This guy did that to me.
He stuck his finger in my face.

1394
01:21:09,620 --> 01:21:10,920
They said Gleason's again,

1395
01:21:11,210 --> 01:21:15,810
g Gelson's Gleason's is a gym
and that's right at Gelson's.

1396
01:21:15,840 --> 01:21:19,930
They did that shit again.
Yeah, no fuck that place.

1397
01:21:20,170 --> 01:21:21,450
He happened to me once where the guy said,

1398
01:21:21,600 --> 01:21:23,990
can I have two minutes for gay
rights or one minute if go down.

1399
01:21:24,480 --> 01:21:28,020
That only happened to me once, but I've
been stopped for a bunch of other things,

1400
01:21:28,450 --> 01:21:31,880
a bunch of other things. Sometimes
they have a whole fucking table set up.

1401
01:21:31,910 --> 01:21:34,680
Oh yeah. Oh yeah. Third
Street or Abbot Kinney.

1402
01:21:34,681 --> 01:21:38,100
There's table set for Syrian
children, blacks, Asians.

1403
01:21:38,200 --> 01:21:41,220
Here's the problem with those things.
I don't have the time to research where,

1404
01:21:41,430 --> 01:21:44,600
where this money's going. I don't
trust people that's about for showing.

1405
01:21:44,790 --> 01:21:46,110
Give the kid money for sure.

1406
01:21:46,111 --> 01:21:49,590
There was some girl look real
aggressive way back in the day.

1407
01:21:49,620 --> 01:21:53,250
It's like more than 10 years ago at the
airports and black chick with a bucket

1408
01:21:53,251 --> 01:21:58,251
and open bucket and she had some binder
with a bunch of photos in it and stuff

1409
01:21:58,591 --> 01:22:00,750
and she was saying, you know,
we're collecting money for this.

1410
01:22:00,810 --> 01:22:03,660
That sounds legit and quiet.
And she goes,

1411
01:22:03,661 --> 01:22:07,140
and she was like real aggressive
about it. I go, yeah, I go, you,

1412
01:22:07,141 --> 01:22:11,340
you have a binder and you have a bucket
that you want me to put money in.

1413
01:22:11,640 --> 01:22:16,290
And she was like, well fuck you then. And
I was like, fuck me that. Oh, okay. I go,

1414
01:22:16,300 --> 01:22:19,260
that makes a lot of sense. You're super
charitable. That's what you're all done.

1415
01:22:19,310 --> 01:22:22,590
I go, you're stealing people's money
with some stupid scam. Like give a,

1416
01:22:22,730 --> 01:22:26,130
you have a bunch of photos
of like downtrodden people
that's in some sort of a

1417
01:22:26,131 --> 01:22:31,131
binder that's buying plastic and you can
close this binder and you tuck it cause

1418
01:22:31,231 --> 01:22:34,680
you're going to get busted and you get
this weird bucket that's wide open.

1419
01:22:34,681 --> 01:22:37,230
You could scoop anything out of it.
And then I asked you about it.

1420
01:22:37,231 --> 01:22:39,720
You say fuck you. Was there
any money in there? Oh yeah,

1421
01:22:39,721 --> 01:22:41,640
there's like a couple bucks
in there already. You know,

1422
01:22:41,641 --> 01:22:42,660
it was one of those weird things.

1423
01:22:42,661 --> 01:22:46,650
It's like who's to stop you from taking
out my rust that like, I was off of, uh,

1424
01:22:46,670 --> 01:22:50,190
the 90 the other day and I came to
stop and I saw this huge banner said,

1425
01:22:50,191 --> 01:22:54,390
help us pay for our father's funeral. It
was like four black guys. And I'm like,

1426
01:22:54,391 --> 01:22:58,080
God, I came a game, we'll 10 spot,
not a 20 minutes. I get crazy.

1427
01:22:58,081 --> 01:23:03,081
But the problem is you don't know if it
really is it mean if this girl really

1428
01:23:03,841 --> 01:23:07,540
was trying to raise money for a
charitable cause, it's really good.

1429
01:23:08,590 --> 01:23:11,860
She didn't represent it very well.
Could. She just seemed like a scammer.

1430
01:23:12,080 --> 01:23:15,130
Like I got out. I was like, look at
that binder. It's just some pictures.

1431
01:23:15,430 --> 01:23:18,100
They're folded up in a binder
and some printed piece of paper.

1432
01:23:18,430 --> 01:23:21,750
There's just too much stuff going
around. Yeah, yeah. Bad stuff.

1433
01:23:21,880 --> 01:23:24,880
The bucket and an open top.
But can you just reach in that bucket?

1434
01:23:24,881 --> 01:23:28,900
You could drop things in them.
Like where's the accountability there?

1435
01:23:28,970 --> 01:23:32,110
How do I show girl?
But that's a good scam.

1436
01:23:32,290 --> 01:23:34,540
Like if you're a person
that wants to scam people,

1437
01:23:34,660 --> 01:23:38,380
that's like a great scan is a
smart move because the car, oh,

1438
01:23:38,381 --> 01:23:42,580
you're gonna make money, dude. If you
go to Vegas or a not Vegas, Lex rather,

1439
01:23:42,700 --> 01:23:46,360
and you're walking like down that where
people are arriving, first of all,

1440
01:23:46,361 --> 01:23:49,840
they just want you to get the fuck away.
They'll throw $5 in there,

1441
01:23:50,170 --> 01:23:53,700
maybe 110 maybe one at a time. They'll
give you money. Why not attend?

1442
01:23:53,770 --> 01:23:57,220
Gives you money, you'd think seen hundreds
of people and the people are gone.

1443
01:23:57,340 --> 01:23:57,760
They not.

1444
01:23:57,760 --> 01:23:59,710
It's not like you're doing this in a
restaurant where they can see you do it to

1445
01:23:59,711 --> 01:24:03,040
one purchase coming. Yeah.
Everybody's constantly filtering out.

1446
01:24:03,110 --> 01:24:05,800
I think security is going
to let you do that. Well,

1447
01:24:06,010 --> 01:24:09,280
I think that's why she had the binder
and that's why I like the whole bucket

1448
01:24:09,281 --> 01:24:12,820
thing was very bizarre. It was a while
ago, so yeah, long time ago. Security.

1449
01:24:12,830 --> 01:24:15,250
You might move along later. Yeah,
this is more than 10 years ago,

1450
01:24:15,450 --> 01:24:19,120
but I'll never forget like how aggressive
she got with me to the point where my

1451
01:24:19,121 --> 01:24:22,480
adrenaline fired up when I was like,
Whoa, this girl might like swinging at me.

1452
01:24:22,510 --> 01:24:26,230
That's why he still at worst. Yeah. She
was like, she when she said, fuck you,

1453
01:24:26,231 --> 01:24:27,910
she was like in my face.

1454
01:24:27,911 --> 01:24:31,870
You can tell like he was enough to know
that she is definitely a hit people

1455
01:24:31,871 --> 01:24:34,210
before and she's not
playing. It was, it was a,

1456
01:24:34,211 --> 01:24:36,460
it was just a person that was a little,

1457
01:24:36,940 --> 01:24:40,270
just a little too aggressive little
teenage kid saw. I'm like, Whoa,

1458
01:24:40,271 --> 01:24:42,520
am I going to get in a fight here?
You get to that,

1459
01:24:42,700 --> 01:24:46,600
that feeling like am I have to get in
a five minute check? Airports, nerves.

1460
01:24:46,680 --> 01:24:51,180
Dude, I, when I was in the
back after the fight, right.

1461
01:24:51,181 --> 01:24:54,090
So again, I'm with heard about
this. Yeah. Tell him about this.

1462
01:24:54,720 --> 01:24:58,290
Can I just clear it up now? So many
people wouldn't blow me up. So again,

1463
01:24:58,291 --> 01:25:00,360
I'm with judge Crawford, Amir Khan, Berto,

1464
01:25:00,361 --> 01:25:03,420
and I'm in the back and they're saying how
good Connor did. I'm like, yeah, great.

1465
01:25:03,450 --> 01:25:05,910
You know, I thought it was going to be
even better, you know, I'm surprised.

1466
01:25:05,911 --> 01:25:09,840
You know he did well and showtime one,
we go do this, a post fight show thing.

1467
01:25:10,560 --> 01:25:13,530
So I'm going and I see Nate
Diaz and he's by himself.

1468
01:25:13,531 --> 01:25:17,100
Like no one's really buying and he's by
himself and he's on his phone and I see

1469
01:25:17,101 --> 01:25:20,040
him and I think, Oh, same
fraternity, UFC guys.

1470
01:25:20,041 --> 01:25:22,260
There's no UFC representatives
there. Really? There's like Dane.

1471
01:25:22,261 --> 01:25:26,340
I didn't see him at the fight. I just
figured, hey, we're brothers. Yeah,

1472
01:25:26,341 --> 01:25:29,700
what's up man? But I was going
towards him because he looked busy.

1473
01:25:29,910 --> 01:25:32,760
I was going to go towards him and
whether he wanted my help or not,

1474
01:25:33,000 --> 01:25:36,840
I figured I know a few things
about marketing. The next
fight for him is Connor.

1475
01:25:37,000 --> 01:25:41,130
I'm assuming he's there to sell that
fight. That should be the next fight.

1476
01:25:41,160 --> 01:25:44,850
Controversy. Uh, Nate Diaz three
the trilogy, that's the fight.

1477
01:25:45,120 --> 01:25:47,950
So I was gonna go to him because I saw
some interviews where it's kinda hating

1478
01:25:47,960 --> 01:25:50,340
on Connor and I would have
spun it the other way.

1479
01:25:50,370 --> 01:25:54,060
He should have celebrated Connor and what
he did winning rounds against the best

1480
01:25:54,061 --> 01:25:57,780
of all time and saying, look, I,
I'd beat him up worse than Floyd.

1481
01:25:57,820 --> 01:26:00,720
Now we're gonna do this trilogy. I'm
going to end them faster than Floyd did.

1482
01:26:00,721 --> 01:26:04,810
Like, that should be the cell. I was
going to talk to him this. So I see him,

1483
01:26:04,811 --> 01:26:06,980
I'll call him my, I'm like,
oh. And they're like, come
on Brennan. We gotta go.

1484
01:26:06,981 --> 01:26:10,520
I'm like, let me just say what's
up to this guy and my go Nate brow.

1485
01:26:10,521 --> 01:26:13,970
How about that fight man, your next
biggest fight in UFC history, brother.

1486
01:26:14,420 --> 01:26:17,300
And he starts laughing.
He's like, Oh hell no.

1487
01:26:17,690 --> 01:26:20,990
How fucking stupid do you look now?
And I'm like,

1488
01:26:21,340 --> 01:26:24,470
I'm my calf ground like Wyatt,
he's a cal stupid.

1489
01:26:24,471 --> 01:26:28,610
Do you look talk in all this shit? I'm
like, Whoa, what are you doing right now?

1490
01:26:28,790 --> 01:26:30,050
What the hell are you doing right now?

1491
01:26:30,350 --> 01:26:33,980
And he keeps talking and there you
go Nate. He doesn't like that stupid.

1492
01:26:33,981 --> 01:26:36,230
He one rounds against
the best box of all time.

1493
01:26:36,650 --> 01:26:39,680
And the Nate's like he didn't win
rounds. He gave him one round. I'm like,

1494
01:26:39,820 --> 01:26:43,520
all right man, either way. So he gave
him, he one rounds though. What are you,

1495
01:26:44,180 --> 01:26:46,280
what are you doing?
And he just keeps talking shit.

1496
01:26:46,281 --> 01:26:48,650
And he starts like talking
about my career and I'm like,

1497
01:26:48,651 --> 01:26:52,640
what is going on right now? I go,
Nate, who's mad at you? I went, Neat.

1498
01:26:52,700 --> 01:26:55,730
I have no issues with you.
You're pointing your gun at the wrong guy.

1499
01:26:55,731 --> 01:26:58,820
What are you doing right now? You should
be selling this fight against Conor,

1500
01:26:58,821 --> 01:27:00,920
not me. I'm not the guy. I said,

1501
01:27:00,921 --> 01:27:05,270
I'm in skinny jeans and Gucci boots for
God's sake. What are you doing right now?

1502
01:27:05,390 --> 01:27:08,630
You know what I'm saying? Right. And
then like showtime was like, come on,

1503
01:27:08,631 --> 01:27:11,600
let's go boys. I'm like,
Jesus Christ man, keep gone.

1504
01:27:11,750 --> 01:27:14,810
I was just embarrassed by the
situation because he kept talking.

1505
01:27:15,030 --> 01:27:18,560
He kept doing this and I, this is
what, this is the part I left out.

1506
01:27:18,590 --> 01:27:20,890
This is what triggered him.
He was talking,

1507
01:27:20,940 --> 01:27:22,490
I literally couldn't hear
cause people were like,

1508
01:27:22,491 --> 01:27:26,690
chocolates go cause they didn't want to,
you know, a fight. So I shop, let's go.

1509
01:27:27,050 --> 01:27:30,260
And I, he keeps talking and
I'm like, Nate, use your words.

1510
01:27:30,261 --> 01:27:32,900
I can't understand a word you're saying.
Use your words.

1511
01:27:33,080 --> 01:27:36,950
Oh and he probably has it
lists or whatever and they'll
probably set them off.

1512
01:27:37,120 --> 01:27:40,580
But I have, I have no issues with
Nathan. So that's when it got ugly. Yeah.

1513
01:27:40,581 --> 01:27:42,580
Then he kept talking shit and I was like,
what are you going to do?

1514
01:27:42,630 --> 01:27:44,720
What are we doing here? And
he kept doing this. I'm like,

1515
01:27:44,890 --> 01:27:46,790
well what the fuck is happening?

1516
01:27:47,000 --> 01:27:50,850
I was so embarrassed because the show time
guys like, oh my God, who is that guy?

1517
01:27:50,851 --> 01:27:54,110
I'm like that. That's the guy
who's supposed to fight Conor next.

1518
01:27:54,111 --> 01:27:57,230
They've fought before and like, why
does he want, what was wrong with him?

1519
01:27:57,290 --> 01:28:01,120
What's wrong with him? I'm
like, it's just, I was so
embarrassed man. I'm like, oh,

1520
01:28:02,000 --> 01:28:05,540
now I have no issues with them. Do
you think the car wants I fight? I do.

1521
01:28:05,870 --> 01:28:09,380
You think that's a good money fight? I
do. I think it's the only fight. I think,

1522
01:28:09,680 --> 01:28:12,800
you know, I think it's the,
the true winner cause at those,

1523
01:28:12,830 --> 01:28:15,560
those fights at 70 or toss
up one and one is whatever.

1524
01:28:15,561 --> 01:28:20,420
Neither one should be fine at 70 at 55 of
trilogy fight makes sense for the belt.

1525
01:28:20,570 --> 01:28:22,490
It'd be the biggest paper you of all time.

1526
01:28:22,670 --> 01:28:24,410
I think it's the only five
that makes sense. You can't do,

1527
01:28:24,411 --> 01:28:26,390
could be Tony and Kevin Lee.

1528
01:28:26,450 --> 01:28:29,610
They're just not big enough stars to get
contracts because it could be as it may

1529
01:28:29,620 --> 01:28:32,360
the way. True. And he's, he's not
ready to fight. He's just, you know,

1530
01:28:32,361 --> 01:28:35,750
he's never done that. So how can
you sell? Could be right now,

1531
01:28:35,751 --> 01:28:39,830
like so let's say just in a perfect world
you want to do could be versus Connor

1532
01:28:39,950 --> 01:28:42,910
and you go on this world tour trying
to build Khabib up. You've got to rush.

1533
01:28:42,911 --> 01:28:45,770
You go over. Connor wants to
fight him in Russia. Crazy.

1534
01:28:46,370 --> 01:28:48,260
How do we know he's going to
make weight and doesn't pull out?

1535
01:28:48,261 --> 01:28:51,560
So it's out of the equation right now. He
needs to come back, fight someone else.

1536
01:28:51,830 --> 01:28:55,160
So to me, be easy to get his body
sorted out and he's a finger assumption.

1537
01:28:55,250 --> 01:28:58,790
Rockhold was saying that his liver
shut down and I read in an interview,

1538
01:28:58,820 --> 01:29:01,710
apologize. I didn't hear him
say or read in an interview.

1539
01:29:02,340 --> 01:29:04,260
He said that his liver shutdown,
uh,

1540
01:29:04,290 --> 01:29:06,180
when he was cutting weight
for the Michael Johnson fight.

1541
01:29:06,690 --> 01:29:10,140
And then the next fight after that,
he didn't make weight.

1542
01:29:10,141 --> 01:29:13,230
His body shut down for the Ferguson
fight and they cancel the fight.

1543
01:29:13,500 --> 01:29:14,333
I'll tell you what though,

1544
01:29:15,080 --> 01:29:17,790
I might to be flying in the conversation
for me and went till he gets his shit

1545
01:29:17,791 --> 01:29:20,550
together. I'm not even entertaining the
idea of him fighting and it looks thick.

1546
01:29:21,630 --> 01:29:24,730
I like Kevin League. He's bad
motherfucker package. He's a bad author.

1547
01:29:24,900 --> 01:29:28,020
But the thing is, he speaks well. He
looks the part talks a lot of shit,

1548
01:29:28,050 --> 01:29:31,950
but he's great. He dresses well. He has
all the makings of your next superstar.

1549
01:29:32,010 --> 01:29:35,100
Yeah. And he realizes now,
especially in the Conor Mcgregor era,

1550
01:29:35,430 --> 01:29:38,270
you've got to talk a lot of
shit. Yeah. Floyd set of paths.

1551
01:29:38,280 --> 01:29:41,400
Like you just can't win fights.
You've got to sell yourself. Listen,

1552
01:29:41,401 --> 01:29:45,870
Kevin Lee is only, I think
25. He's young. 25 or 24.

1553
01:29:45,990 --> 01:29:49,490
Yeah, find out he's 24, 25. Um,

1554
01:29:49,620 --> 01:29:51,260
super young right now.

1555
01:29:51,300 --> 01:29:55,110
Remember how brash Connor was
when he first got to the UFC?

1556
01:29:55,590 --> 01:30:00,270
Very similar. He's like 26, I believe.
Okay. So He's 24. September 4th.

1557
01:30:00,271 --> 01:30:04,260
He's almost 25.
He'll be 25 in a couple of days.

1558
01:30:05,460 --> 01:30:08,940
He's super talented.
Looks better every time you see him.

1559
01:30:08,941 --> 01:30:12,330
So he's essentially like somewhere
around Conner's age. When Connor,

1560
01:30:12,390 --> 01:30:15,330
he's like a year younger than
of first burst on the scene.

1561
01:30:15,810 --> 01:30:18,350
And Connor was nobody back then.
Nobody knew who he was. We'd do.

1562
01:30:18,380 --> 01:30:21,020
I had seen him on the Internet,
uh,

1563
01:30:21,030 --> 01:30:23,460
and from fights in England and
I knew it was really talented.

1564
01:30:23,670 --> 01:30:26,850
I actually went back and forth with
them. What's between us, you have to say.

1565
01:30:27,210 --> 01:30:28,800
So there's a few people
who knew about him,

1566
01:30:29,040 --> 01:30:31,710
but it was nothing like what
you see now. Nothing. Right?

1567
01:30:31,860 --> 01:30:36,600
Kevin Lee down the road is at 155
pounder who talks a lot of shit.

1568
01:30:37,020 --> 01:30:40,650
He's a bad motherfucker.
Straight. He looks great.
Speaks well, built like a brick.

1569
01:30:40,651 --> 01:30:45,390
Shithouse speaks well speaks well. African
American dress as well. Check, check,

1570
01:30:45,450 --> 01:30:47,910
check, check, check. All the boxes
checked and he can fucking fight.

1571
01:30:48,150 --> 01:30:51,970
So what's the biggest thing that fight
with Conor McGregor down the road? Ooh,

1572
01:30:52,020 --> 01:30:54,740
you're gonna need, you need more time
by here. You right down the road.

1573
01:30:55,050 --> 01:30:59,370
This is my thing for Connor like,
but he could do it. He go 100%.

1574
01:30:59,371 --> 01:31:03,080
I'll tell him to me. Kevin leads your next
big thing. However, Tevin leavers, uh,

1575
01:31:03,150 --> 01:31:07,440
Tony Ferguson's a Taj site,
so god good.

1576
01:31:07,540 --> 01:31:11,400
Oh great fight until he was another one.
Tony Ferguson down the road.

1577
01:31:11,520 --> 01:31:15,600
20 Ferguson can talk some shit
to Tony Ferguson is very smooth.

1578
01:31:15,870 --> 01:31:19,020
Tony Ferguson is very confident
and she also a Weirdo.

1579
01:31:19,080 --> 01:31:23,780
He's wearing his that weird vibe. You get
that weird vibe is so intense but like,

1580
01:31:23,781 --> 01:31:26,130
yeah, I was like no classes,
wing Chung and shit.

1581
01:31:26,420 --> 01:31:29,940
He does all these weird moves where he's
like get flowing on the ground rolling

1582
01:31:29,941 --> 01:31:30,540
around.

1583
01:31:30,540 --> 01:31:35,010
He does a lot of weird shit but
his endurance is off the charts.

1584
01:31:35,130 --> 01:31:38,820
He cuts a shit load of weight and does
it like a professional again to set can

1585
01:31:39,000 --> 01:31:42,880
capitalize on that and he wins by
knockout. He also Wednesday side mission,

1586
01:31:43,420 --> 01:31:47,610
very get the guys. He's beat two tough
death for Kevin. It's a very tough test.

1587
01:31:47,620 --> 01:31:51,930
Both have very good to me as far as
like potential like superstardom.

1588
01:31:51,960 --> 01:31:55,980
Those are the guys. Kevin Lee is that,
that's the guy right now I think. Yeah,

1589
01:31:55,981 --> 01:31:58,500
maybe. But if Tony Ferguson
becomes the interim champion,

1590
01:31:58,501 --> 01:32:00,040
it starts talking all kinds of crazy shit.
His

1591
01:32:00,040 --> 01:32:01,670
star will rise, man, don't get me wrong.

1592
01:32:01,671 --> 01:32:05,310
Does it demonstrate in rising and then
be coming like a straight up superstar

1593
01:32:05,440 --> 01:32:09,250
like a transcendent like Conor McGregor.
Ronda Rousey's like there's a certain,

1594
01:32:09,850 --> 01:32:13,720
there's a certain thing Canelo because
he's not really charismatic and he only

1595
01:32:13,721 --> 01:32:17,410
speaks Spanish. So with the
Mexicans it collects just Mexicans.

1596
01:32:17,411 --> 01:32:19,330
He twice and also like a trip,

1597
01:32:19,350 --> 01:32:23,920
Mexico has sort of a built in boxing
base through the king of boxing.

1598
01:32:23,950 --> 01:32:28,470
You're in, you're Mexican,
you're already basically, here
you go, you're selling. No,

1599
01:32:28,480 --> 01:32:31,480
you're good. Barely. Barely talks.
He's not, he's not entertaining at all.

1600
01:32:31,600 --> 01:32:35,440
The entertaining fighter
maybe or Mexicans. He's all
right. Fuck you saying no,

1601
01:32:35,441 --> 01:32:38,290
he's from the same hometown
is my girl. She's like, no,
he's not to interview them.

1602
01:32:38,291 --> 01:32:41,920
It's whatever. But Gunner Gennady
Golovkin who's equally impressive,

1603
01:32:41,921 --> 01:32:45,580
if not more impressive than Canelo.
He's undefeated. He Merck's everybody,

1604
01:32:45,581 --> 01:32:49,630
everybody. He's a goddamn murderous
body puncher and you know,

1605
01:32:49,631 --> 01:32:53,170
he can sound like like 150 papers,
150 200 Max.

1606
01:32:53,780 --> 01:32:57,370
He doesn't have the star quality and
50,000 page views for one of the very best

1607
01:32:57,371 --> 01:33:00,130
boxers on the planet are,
if not the best undefeated.

1608
01:33:00,190 --> 01:33:05,140
How about 175,000 for Andre Ward?
Crazy. 125 for the rematch. Crazy man.

1609
01:33:05,141 --> 01:33:06,280
That's even crazy.
It's nuts.

1610
01:33:06,460 --> 01:33:08,740
I don't even think it was
170 I think we looked at it.

1611
01:33:08,741 --> 01:33:13,741
I think we run 60 sets a real bomb on
67 and like one 25 or split again to

1612
01:33:14,320 --> 01:33:16,930
become like a straight
up household superstar.

1613
01:33:16,931 --> 01:33:21,000
It takes more than just being this bad
ass fighter and Anja looks after that.

1614
01:33:21,010 --> 01:33:24,850
Everything Andre Ward is like,
he's articulate, he's admirable.

1615
01:33:25,000 --> 01:33:27,460
He seems like he's got a great
control of his ego. He's smart.

1616
01:33:27,461 --> 01:33:30,580
He's a great hitter. Comes from a rough
background. That's a great stories,

1617
01:33:30,590 --> 01:33:32,970
but at the same trainer
since he was 12 yeah,

1618
01:33:33,010 --> 01:33:36,640
he's never lost Olympic gold medalist.
I wonder why he lost,

1619
01:33:36,670 --> 01:33:38,730
there's something that he lost
that cove left. Yeah, right.

1620
01:33:38,800 --> 01:33:43,000
He loves something about him that people
just don't, I don't know what it is.

1621
01:33:43,030 --> 01:33:45,220
I thought he lost to Kavala fight,
but I thought it was close,

1622
01:33:45,340 --> 01:33:47,350
but the second fight
he fuck Koval I've up.

1623
01:33:48,520 --> 01:33:52,200
That's what's important because
that was a big, a big turnaround.

1624
01:33:52,250 --> 01:33:54,580
How about Deontay wilder?
Yeah.

1625
01:33:54,640 --> 01:33:57,520
He's our American born
heavyweight champion.

1626
01:33:57,940 --> 01:34:00,670
He had come in right now with two
pizzas and we'd be like, what's up bro?

1627
01:34:00,730 --> 01:34:03,820
They know what stopped him out. No one
knows who he is. Crazy. It is crazy.

1628
01:34:03,850 --> 01:34:07,220
And he's supposed to fight or tease. I
think that's the, the room is dangerous.

1629
01:34:07,470 --> 01:34:10,960
I don't like that fight for him to our
teas is a bad motherfucker. And then on,

1630
01:34:11,020 --> 01:34:15,250
uh, at the Joshua was supposed to
fight that a Russian fellow. Um,

1631
01:34:15,310 --> 01:34:18,010
and then I think the winner of
those two fight, I forget his name.

1632
01:34:19,150 --> 01:34:21,610
It's a tough fight for, uh,
Joshua, we should win it,

1633
01:34:21,611 --> 01:34:25,720
but a fricking wilder has a tough fight
on and since, yeah, it's super tough.

1634
01:34:25,721 --> 01:34:30,330
Fight that Ortiz's he's very good.
He's a southpaw south Paul King,

1635
01:34:30,470 --> 01:34:33,880
they call him King Kong. Yeah, he's a
beast and I don't like that platform,

1636
01:34:33,970 --> 01:34:37,120
but neither one of those,
like Joshua was a big star looks,

1637
01:34:37,121 --> 01:34:41,860
the part speaks well knockout artists
at that great fight with Klitschko.

1638
01:34:42,040 --> 01:34:44,230
So he kind of has that.
But those other guys,

1639
01:34:44,260 --> 01:34:47,620
there's just nothing in Joshua will be
that way. It will be giant for the UK,

1640
01:34:47,650 --> 01:34:50,830
especially if he defends the show
a few times. Huge giant, giant,

1641
01:34:51,250 --> 01:34:54,810
bigger and bigger with every fight he'll,
he's got superstar status. He's great.

1642
01:34:54,830 --> 01:34:57,980
He's super articulate,
very reserved

1643
01:34:57,980 --> 01:35:00,530
in the UFC with Jon Jones out.

1644
01:35:00,531 --> 01:35:04,550
He's really your only next superstar
and he's a notch down from Connor.

1645
01:35:04,551 --> 01:35:08,540
Like there's Connor Brock Lesnar Rhonda.
They're here. Commons even above them.

1646
01:35:08,600 --> 01:35:11,810
And then there's your second tissue
start and he got Jon Jones. Jon Jones,

1647
01:35:11,840 --> 01:35:16,340
it goes, becomes the number one
fuck up of all time for sure.

1648
01:35:16,341 --> 01:35:17,780
Hands down if he wasn't already.

1649
01:35:18,170 --> 01:35:21,560
This is the biggest one that's consistent
at beating the shit out of people,

1650
01:35:21,561 --> 01:35:25,220
not to gone. Very consistent
and consistent at fucking up.

1651
01:35:25,490 --> 01:35:30,490
Now we can only hope and pray that
somehow or another there's some mistake.

1652
01:35:30,680 --> 01:35:34,880
How many times are we going to go over
this? Yeah, you around saying like, dude,

1653
01:35:34,881 --> 01:35:37,640
you're breaking our heart man.
He's so God damn good.

1654
01:35:37,730 --> 01:35:40,160
You watch that fight with Daniel
Carme and you're like, Jesus Christ.

1655
01:35:40,161 --> 01:35:44,240
He's so good. He's so good. But do we
take the PDS and the account now? Like,

1656
01:35:44,241 --> 01:35:46,520
how do we know what real
John Joe are we getting?

1657
01:35:46,521 --> 01:35:50,890
Because the one we saw with the Osp one
and it looked like shit and then as DC

1658
01:35:50,900 --> 01:35:53,990
the best of all time now cause he's
beat everybody including heavyweights,

1659
01:35:54,170 --> 01:35:57,080
but lots of Jon Jones. But
wait, Jon Jones was taken PDDs

1660
01:35:58,630 --> 01:36:01,250
it's just a hot mess.
It has a hot mass.

1661
01:36:01,251 --> 01:36:04,680
Meanwhile owes the mayor's like fucking
bring it. Opposed Amir's market.

1662
01:36:04,681 --> 01:36:07,730
Those donors like fucking bring it with.
That guy's got bricks for hands too.

1663
01:36:07,731 --> 01:36:09,890
But let me tell you something, man.
When I shook his hand after the fight,

1664
01:36:09,891 --> 01:36:14,000
I was like, oh, okay. You know how
some dudes you just shake their hand.

1665
01:36:14,001 --> 01:36:17,900
You're like, oh I get it. He's
got giant hands, dude bricks.

1666
01:36:18,290 --> 01:36:21,350
They feel like bricks. I think you
do that did puts hands on people.

1667
01:36:21,351 --> 01:36:25,070
He fucks people up. See, I think
you do. Let's say John's out, right?

1668
01:36:25,130 --> 01:36:28,720
Long story for years. Suspension
out. I broke my heart. See it.

1669
01:36:28,721 --> 01:36:31,090
Go to Japan just to the Gills
and fuck all the whores you want.

1670
01:36:31,110 --> 01:36:34,040
Do whatever you want. Oh right. I'm
out. I'm over it. I'm mad at them.

1671
01:36:34,160 --> 01:36:39,050
So then you have [inaudible] de Mer verse
Guston to fight DC a hundred percent

1672
01:36:39,051 --> 01:36:43,400
it's great. Fine, right? Very
Fun. Fight. Fight Gustafson
is so veteran. He's so good.

1673
01:36:43,401 --> 01:36:46,760
It's guests. It's Gustafson.
Coming off of that Glover fight,

1674
01:36:46,790 --> 01:36:50,480
I almost want to see OSTP [inaudible]
fight more people because this to former

1675
01:36:50,890 --> 01:36:53,350
crazy,
he just grabbed a hold of Janie.

1676
01:36:53,360 --> 01:36:55,850
Malik clipped him with that
left hook inside the clench.

1677
01:36:55,880 --> 01:36:59,090
But that's all there is though, Jo. Like,
hey, bring it on. Bring up to a five.

1678
01:36:59,091 --> 01:37:03,510
Like you look at it like, oh my God,
it's the other one left dinosaurs.

1679
01:37:03,530 --> 01:37:06,230
Especially now that rumbles out and
rumble was a stable mate. Anyway,

1680
01:37:06,530 --> 01:37:09,170
the word was that he was the guy that
was farmed with brumble all the time.

1681
01:37:09,200 --> 01:37:11,030
Oh really? Yeah. Yeah.

1682
01:37:11,450 --> 01:37:14,360
And he was one of the few guys that was
willing to spar with Ramos a monster.

1683
01:37:14,390 --> 01:37:18,010
He's a bad motherfucker. No time. He's
got the worst nickname involved. No time,

1684
01:37:18,040 --> 01:37:22,100
no time. No time. No time owes to mirror
what's the best nickname of all time.

1685
01:37:22,880 --> 01:37:27,530
The Best Kukui is pretty God.
Damn good.

1686
01:37:27,590 --> 01:37:29,210
That's pretty bad ass.
That's pretty good.

1687
01:37:29,240 --> 01:37:33,170
What's Kevin Leaves a Detroit
superstar. Yeah. That's fucking sick.

1688
01:37:33,171 --> 01:37:37,370
And you're from Detroit. That's
good name. Pretty sick. Oh, what?

1689
01:37:37,420 --> 01:37:40,740
What was the conch shell? Crunk chank. Uh,

1690
01:37:40,820 --> 01:37:43,790
what's the porno star two when
he wasn't he Detroit superstar.

1691
01:37:44,090 --> 01:37:47,750
What's Kevin leaves and they share the
same nickname because that can't, that.

1692
01:37:48,560 --> 01:37:53,030
That's fucking rude. Motown
phenom. Kevin Lowe. Tom, eh?

1693
01:37:54,260 --> 01:37:58,170
That's fucking, oh, that's
murder's not bad. That's the
best hard to market though.

1694
01:37:58,480 --> 01:38:01,860
Dare. Yeah. Daren Cruickshank. Is Detroit
too bizarre to you? That's my favorite.

1695
01:38:01,890 --> 01:38:05,950
Kevin Lee is Motown. Phenol hotel phenom.
Sas. Right, too. That's pretty good.

1696
01:38:05,951 --> 01:38:08,880
That's murder of this day and age.
Harder market. Axe murders. The best.

1697
01:38:08,881 --> 01:38:12,060
The natural. That's pretty good, man.

1698
01:38:12,090 --> 01:38:15,600
The testing back then was not enough
to substantiate these claims. I agree.

1699
01:38:16,050 --> 01:38:19,980
I agree. That's murder. Just tough
to sell the companies these days.

1700
01:38:20,400 --> 01:38:23,940
The prodigies. Pretty God. Damn good.
Well, Bj was as you best. Brilliant.

1701
01:38:23,970 --> 01:38:26,010
Pretty God damn good.
Yeah.

1702
01:38:26,190 --> 01:38:30,960
The phenom when Vito was mark and people
feign up who's the best right now? Bell.

1703
01:38:30,990 --> 01:38:33,900
Elka. Kukui think Elle.
Kukui. Yeah, I think so.

1704
01:38:34,510 --> 01:38:38,580
So goddamned supernatural. Boogeyman. God,
no heavyweights really have nicknames.

1705
01:38:38,581 --> 01:38:42,120
Let's try to think of the heavyweights.
Not really just Cain Velasquez, Steve Bay,

1706
01:38:42,300 --> 01:38:47,100
but Elke, didn't he call himself?
What's that Russian name? Sexy. I'm at.

1707
01:38:47,120 --> 01:38:51,780
That was there it goes that that, but that
nickname, people like he didn't use it.

1708
01:38:52,200 --> 01:38:56,760
Koreans. Other people did. Uncle
creepy. The Mexican is pretty God. Damn.

1709
01:38:56,761 --> 01:39:00,480
These are old. Yeah.
Acts wearing number five.

1710
01:39:00,481 --> 01:39:04,170
How dare you Kimbo slice.
Get the fuck out of here.

1711
01:39:04,470 --> 01:39:09,030
That's his nickname. It's not like
his, the natural. What's number one?

1712
01:39:09,300 --> 01:39:13,690
That was the sexy, sexy,
sexy Mama. He says, I see.

1713
01:39:15,210 --> 01:39:18,650
That'd be sick.
Yeah.

1714
01:39:18,660 --> 01:39:23,100
I have a girl fights with that sexy karate
hottie is not a bad, that's not bad,

1715
01:39:23,101 --> 01:39:27,600
dad. There's just no, there's
nothing great stuff out
there and Cyborg is not bad,

1716
01:39:27,601 --> 01:39:30,300
but her husband's name is cyborg too,
so it's like

1717
01:39:32,010 --> 01:39:36,140
you can't double Cyborg gotta do some
Cyborg or the guy that you went with a

1718
01:39:36,780 --> 01:39:40,320
sideboard and Silverado brew in Brazil.

1719
01:39:40,321 --> 01:39:43,320
Sideboards and silvers or like Joe's and
bills here. You know what I'm saying?

1720
01:39:43,410 --> 01:39:45,540
There's a bunch of Cyborgs,
right? There's other cyborgs.

1721
01:39:45,541 --> 01:39:46,530
I'm trying to think of other ones.

1722
01:39:46,531 --> 01:39:49,020
There's one other guy that I
know that call themselves Cyborg.

1723
01:39:49,070 --> 01:39:53,570
It was a Jujitsu Guy, I think. Does
anyone ever call you Joey? Never. Nah.

1724
01:39:53,620 --> 01:39:54,453
Really know,

1725
01:39:54,990 --> 01:39:59,010
but also I'm friends with
Diaz and everybody calls him
Joey until he's been Joey,

1726
01:39:59,670 --> 01:40:03,960
but his name is Jose. Really? Yeah.

1727
01:40:04,080 --> 01:40:07,380
Joey's Diaz. His name is
Jose Diaz. Oh, well yeah,

1728
01:40:08,160 --> 01:40:11,180
but we've always called him Joey. Yeah,
that makes sense. Yeah. You would call,

1729
01:40:11,220 --> 01:40:14,460
well Jose Joe. He could.
Yeah, you can for sure,

1730
01:40:14,580 --> 01:40:18,120
but I think growing up everybody called
him Joe. Do you have a nickname as a kid?

1731
01:40:18,180 --> 01:40:21,870
No. No nickname. No, just straight up
Joe. Yeah. I never really had a nickname.

1732
01:40:22,110 --> 01:40:23,160
Nothing too.

1733
01:40:23,161 --> 01:40:26,580
When I used to play pool pool halls or
the place where everybody gets a nickname,

1734
01:40:27,030 --> 01:40:29,340
there's,
there's so many crazy nicknames people.

1735
01:40:29,400 --> 01:40:31,530
A lot of times the nickname
was like where you come from?

1736
01:40:31,531 --> 01:40:36,060
Like white plains Charlie or Mount
Vernon. Tommy. There was a lot of that.

1737
01:40:36,510 --> 01:40:38,160
My nickname was Joe,
the comedian.

1738
01:40:40,500 --> 01:40:43,560
Real creative guys. It's so
lame. I was Joe the comedian,

1739
01:40:43,740 --> 01:40:45,060
but you're the funny guy in the pool.

1740
01:40:45,090 --> 01:40:47,640
While they knew I was a professional
comedian that would come and play pool

1741
01:40:47,810 --> 01:40:51,330
those like ray the fireman?
No, no, no. I was like 20.

1742
01:40:51,360 --> 01:40:54,010
When I first started playing pool.
It's right after I tore my

1743
01:40:54,010 --> 01:40:58,660
ACL, so I think I was 23. So like,
Hey, it's Bob the ups driver. Yes.

1744
01:40:58,690 --> 01:41:02,920
Real original theory. The fireman,
goddammit. Yeah, white plains.

1745
01:41:02,921 --> 01:41:04,030
Charlie was a big one.

1746
01:41:04,480 --> 01:41:08,320
This is like crazy little semi homeless
guys to come and play pool all the time.

1747
01:41:08,680 --> 01:41:10,750
He was addicted gambler.

1748
01:41:11,810 --> 01:41:15,700
So many guys I realized about
gambling addicts when I played pool.

1749
01:41:15,730 --> 01:41:19,750
I just did not know how many of them
there were because I'd never been around

1750
01:41:19,751 --> 01:41:23,110
them. I'd never been see like
until I started playing pool,

1751
01:41:23,470 --> 01:41:26,800
I didn't go places like,
uh,

1752
01:41:27,340 --> 01:41:31,300
like a night club type
environment or like a,

1753
01:41:31,301 --> 01:41:34,420
a place where a bunch of like CD
people would hang out with, you know,

1754
01:41:34,560 --> 01:41:35,770
pool halls or CD,

1755
01:41:36,070 --> 01:41:39,400
like a lot of gambling and shit
talking and people betting on things.

1756
01:41:39,520 --> 01:41:40,750
I didn't grow up around that.

1757
01:41:41,500 --> 01:41:45,750
My high school years was all
taekwondo and then after that, yeah,

1758
01:41:45,760 --> 01:41:48,280
it was all martial arts camp competition
and then all of a sudden I'm around

1759
01:41:48,281 --> 01:41:50,650
these complete degenerates,

1760
01:41:51,010 --> 01:41:54,160
like I'd never been around them and I'm
23 which is good life lesson though.

1761
01:41:54,250 --> 01:41:56,140
It was interesting.
I was a lot,

1762
01:41:56,141 --> 01:41:57,820
there was a lot of people
that are addicted to drugs.

1763
01:41:57,821 --> 01:42:00,760
There was a lot of methadone people
that would come during the day and they

1764
01:42:00,761 --> 01:42:03,730
would just be like half out of it and
they would play pool and they were

1765
01:42:03,731 --> 01:42:07,430
terrible. No one just hustling
for their money. The White House,

1766
01:42:07,470 --> 01:42:09,410
when they would just play pool
with each other, they would,

1767
01:42:09,411 --> 01:42:12,730
but they would call him the Methadone
eons and they would come in and play pool

1768
01:42:12,731 --> 01:42:16,060
and you just bang balls were like, they
couldn't concentrate Baldwin for real.

1769
01:42:16,061 --> 01:42:17,740
They could not concentrate,
you know shit.

1770
01:42:18,010 --> 01:42:21,130
But it's funny because it's like what
it was like was it were like a bunch of

1771
01:42:21,131 --> 01:42:22,840
people that were under a spell.
It would come in,

1772
01:42:22,841 --> 01:42:25,840
they'd be just fine and they would
play pool, but they were dull.

1773
01:42:25,870 --> 01:42:29,170
They were like gray. People just pass.
They're never, there was no vibrant color.

1774
01:42:29,370 --> 01:42:33,190
Correct. It goes on, but
the crazy thing is though,

1775
01:42:33,430 --> 01:42:36,090
there was a guy who was
the best player I ever saw,

1776
01:42:36,100 --> 01:42:37,530
one of the best players I ever saw,

1777
01:42:37,550 --> 01:42:42,550
and he was a heroin addict and he
would do heroin and he would do,

1778
01:42:42,791 --> 01:42:43,870
he would go into the bathroom,

1779
01:42:43,900 --> 01:42:48,310
he would shoot up and he would come out
and he would sit down on up one of those

1780
01:42:48,311 --> 01:42:50,050
bar stools.
One was pool stools,

1781
01:42:50,051 --> 01:42:52,630
you know that kind of elevated
with a thing for your drink.

1782
01:42:52,860 --> 01:42:57,340
He would sit there on this like this
for a fucking half an hour and everybody

1783
01:42:57,341 --> 01:43:00,250
knew what was going on here, that he had
to do this. He just sit there like this,

1784
01:43:00,790 --> 01:43:03,040
just highest shit so fucked up.

1785
01:43:03,041 --> 01:43:05,500
And I never been around anybody
who was on heroin either.

1786
01:43:05,590 --> 01:43:07,840
I've only seen everybody intervention.
They had explained it to me.

1787
01:43:07,850 --> 01:43:11,620
My friend Johnny, who did a bunch of
drugs would explain to me and he's like,

1788
01:43:11,621 --> 01:43:14,320
just going back to do his shit. I go,
[inaudible] Shit does he do? He's going,

1789
01:43:14,321 --> 01:43:15,250
he's going to fucking shoot up,

1790
01:43:15,600 --> 01:43:18,280
couldn't go shoot up and he's going to
come out and he's going to sit down for

1791
01:43:18,290 --> 01:43:21,330
awhile and then you have shoots for while
I was going to play cause they've just,

1792
01:43:21,390 --> 01:43:24,540
that ass dude he would
get up and he had no feet.

1793
01:43:24,590 --> 01:43:28,510
He'd be like the guy who was playing
this Guy George, the Greek George.

1794
01:43:28,690 --> 01:43:33,160
Yeah George the Greek was a one of
the local big time guys and he was a a

1795
01:43:33,161 --> 01:43:35,640
wealthy guy. He was always
gambling. He gamble high,

1796
01:43:35,920 --> 01:43:39,340
you know he would say like crazy shit
like it got the height of a mustard seed.

1797
01:43:39,600 --> 01:43:43,510
You Cock sucker and raspy guy
always smoking cigarettes.

1798
01:43:43,630 --> 01:43:46,840
You could smoke cigarettes indoor back
then everybody smart tire place filled

1799
01:43:46,841 --> 01:43:51,130
with smoke and he was gambling against
this guy and he had like some crazy

1800
01:43:51,800 --> 01:43:55,910
because this guy was like literally a
world class pool player and his fucking

1801
01:43:55,911 --> 01:43:59,180
guy didn't miss a ball and he's like
he shoots the fucking nerves off.

1802
01:43:59,330 --> 01:44:02,900
He goes into that bathroom and he shoots
that shit and he shoots his fucking

1803
01:44:02,901 --> 01:44:06,230
nerves. Off, he comes out of your cam is
a ball. The realize man, he would just,

1804
01:44:06,260 --> 01:44:10,430
he was so dead behind the eyes. Like you'd
look at his eyes and they were black,

1805
01:44:10,431 --> 01:44:12,880
like a durables,
like a strike to short young sharks.

1806
01:44:13,150 --> 01:44:16,850
He was just gone to or both eyes
are black is for lack as foe. Dude.

1807
01:44:16,851 --> 01:44:19,290
That's what he was lying. I'm telling
you, it was the weirdest thing around him.

1808
01:44:19,291 --> 01:44:22,610
Like he would look right through you.
He didn't see you. He was just blinked.

1809
01:44:22,620 --> 01:44:26,780
Grieved on heroin. He couldn't miss.
Couldn't miss maybe want to do heroin.

1810
01:44:26,781 --> 01:44:30,020
He's probably dead now though. Oh,
he's dead. I know he's dead. Oh, 100%.

1811
01:44:30,230 --> 01:44:34,700
I ran into him at a pool tournament when
I first moved to La in 1994 and this

1812
01:44:34,701 --> 01:44:38,870
guy tried to get me to drive
him to Compton so he could cop.

1813
01:44:39,050 --> 01:44:42,620
He asked me to put him, he asked me
to put him in the pool tournament.

1814
01:44:42,621 --> 01:44:47,310
There's a pool tournament. Um, ad
um, uh, God dammit. What's it called?

1815
01:44:47,320 --> 01:44:49,430
Hard Times. Hard Times.
Bill Years in Bellflower.

1816
01:44:49,431 --> 01:44:51,980
It's one of the biggest pool
halls in the world. Hard Times.

1817
01:44:51,981 --> 01:44:55,640
It's like a world famous pool hall
and it's in Bellflower, California.

1818
01:44:55,790 --> 01:45:00,790
And a lot of big time gamblers and top
level players used to play there all the

1819
01:45:01,191 --> 01:45:03,840
time. And even came out of
there like Keith McCready.

1820
01:45:03,930 --> 01:45:07,280
It was like the guy from the color of
money, he was the nemesis of Tom Cruise.

1821
01:45:07,580 --> 01:45:10,130
Legitimately one of the best pool
players in the world at the time.

1822
01:45:10,730 --> 01:45:13,580
Came out of there.
So this is a huge pool hall,

1823
01:45:13,610 --> 01:45:17,060
like one of the biggest like pro
level pool halls in the world.

1824
01:45:17,420 --> 01:45:21,590
And I get there and I see this guy,
they call them buffalo bill or water dog.

1825
01:45:21,620 --> 01:45:23,270
Those are his two nicknames.
Squatter Doug,

1826
01:45:23,420 --> 01:45:26,330
depending upon which part of the
country and what time of the year.

1827
01:45:26,350 --> 01:45:29,990
What are dogs? Cool. So I ran into
him and a I, Mike, are you playing?

1828
01:45:29,991 --> 01:45:31,880
What are you doing out
here? And he was like, yeah,

1829
01:45:31,881 --> 01:45:33,620
I just need to get somebody to
put me in the tournament. I'll,

1830
01:45:33,621 --> 01:45:36,420
so I'll put you in the tournament.
Like it was like, I don't know,

1831
01:45:36,421 --> 01:45:38,480
20 bucks or something like that.
He didn't even have 20 bucks.

1832
01:45:38,660 --> 01:45:41,420
Need you to front of $20 post to get
them in a tournament or whatever.

1833
01:45:41,630 --> 01:45:44,180
I don't remember how much it costs.
Might've been 50 bucks, whatever it was.

1834
01:45:44,270 --> 01:45:46,460
I was like, I'll put you in
hit or legit chance to win.

1835
01:45:46,670 --> 01:45:49,460
Like he was a world class player.
He's like, okay, better got to go to,

1836
01:45:49,720 --> 01:45:53,210
got to go to Compton so I can cop.
And I was like, what? And he was like,

1837
01:45:53,211 --> 01:45:54,440
you've got to drive me to calm down.
I'm like,

1838
01:45:54,470 --> 01:45:59,150
I'm not driving you to Compton so you
could buy heroin because if they arrest

1839
01:45:59,151 --> 01:46:03,930
you, they take your car. Like if I
was here with the transaction, right.

1840
01:46:03,960 --> 01:46:06,760
Oh they confiscate your car.
Oh, I was like, you got to,

1841
01:46:06,761 --> 01:46:11,750
I had a 1994 Toyota super bitch
bitch. You crazy. Super Turbo.

1842
01:46:11,751 --> 01:46:16,350
The cow with a big crazy stupid
purple silver. I love the purple one.

1843
01:46:16,550 --> 01:46:20,570
I was wanting to space it pro. My cars
are almost all sower. I hear you. Damn,

1844
01:46:20,571 --> 01:46:24,410
that's sick drive. That thing that Compton
and he looked the ways we do to that,

1845
01:46:24,411 --> 01:46:29,060
the first nice car ever had ever,
you know, I was like uh, at the time,

1846
01:46:29,061 --> 01:46:32,300
probably 27 ball in for
the first time I live hell.

1847
01:46:32,301 --> 01:46:35,660
And I'm like what should a Postmates
that shit. I was like, I have a condo.

1848
01:46:36,020 --> 01:46:39,410
I rent a condo right now.
Motherfuckers not given all this up.

1849
01:46:40,100 --> 01:46:43,840
I was like so excited. He's all sad. Oh
yeah, super sad. Super Sad. Super is that,

1850
01:46:43,910 --> 01:46:45,590
and he went out there and he
lost two matches in a row,

1851
01:46:45,591 --> 01:46:49,040
like barely paid attention.
I put him in the tournament anyway,

1852
01:46:49,110 --> 01:46:50,130
asked me to put them in any way

1853
01:46:50,220 --> 01:46:53,430
like, but $90 drugs man without
heroin he could not play well.

1854
01:46:53,431 --> 01:46:57,450
He was so itchy I think. I think those
guys they'd get off of that stuff.

1855
01:46:57,590 --> 01:47:00,100
A cold Turkey.
Like if you have a your Jones and Ford,

1856
01:47:00,101 --> 01:47:03,300
will you put them in a tournament
with withdrawals? Fucked up.

1857
01:47:03,301 --> 01:47:04,710
I don't know if it was even withdrawals,

1858
01:47:04,711 --> 01:47:08,220
he'd probably gotten a lot earlier
that day. He was just Jones.

1859
01:47:08,460 --> 01:47:11,980
I don't think it was a full withdrawal
one cause he seemed pretty, you know,

1860
01:47:12,000 --> 01:47:15,960
I think when they get withdrawn, Olin
does that a word. Withdrawal. Withdrawal.

1861
01:47:16,020 --> 01:47:20,190
They start sweating and shit and the
shape. It's like they have the seeker,

1862
01:47:20,310 --> 01:47:23,790
like they have the flu. I tried going off
coffee for a day and I got withdrawals.

1863
01:47:23,850 --> 01:47:27,210
I get headaches. I was
like sweating, clammy skin.

1864
01:47:27,810 --> 01:47:32,490
I'm 100% addicted to caffeine. Me 200%
I'm not mad at it though. I love caffeine.

1865
01:47:32,491 --> 01:47:35,460
I like life with caffeine. I
like coffee. I like the ritual.

1866
01:47:35,461 --> 01:47:39,210
I get up in the morning, I drink some
coffee, I'll do a little reading.

1867
01:47:39,240 --> 01:47:41,850
I do a little writing
sometimes to take a giant shit.

1868
01:47:42,420 --> 01:47:46,560
Then I worked in standard routine.
Used to work out right away,

1869
01:47:46,650 --> 01:47:50,100
but I found out that it's better if
I let my brain warm up a little bit.

1870
01:47:50,150 --> 01:47:53,790
Just get him a little foggy. Yeah, we
got them on file. You have my coffee,

1871
01:47:53,850 --> 01:47:55,740
take my kid for a walk
and then I hit the gym.

1872
01:47:55,800 --> 01:47:57,320
Sometimes I like to look at the news too,

1873
01:47:57,340 --> 01:48:00,180
just to make sure the world's not fucking
falling apart before I start my day.

1874
01:48:00,300 --> 01:48:03,960
Yeah, I might. Yeah. It's just like to
be in the know, you know I go to Google,

1875
01:48:04,110 --> 01:48:08,370
I have this like Google news things set
up on my phone so I'll hit that without

1876
01:48:08,371 --> 01:48:11,220
looking at social media and said I
don't get looking at my own stuff.

1877
01:48:11,220 --> 01:48:14,130
I just go and read stuff about like
what's happened in the world. Everything.

1878
01:48:14,131 --> 01:48:16,890
Okay, we're going to war with
Korea. We're good Santa Right.

1879
01:48:17,040 --> 01:48:18,470
Like to check off your shit happening.

1880
01:48:18,480 --> 01:48:22,670
Some fire I need to know about to light
fire season right now buddy. Dude, it's,

1881
01:48:22,680 --> 01:48:26,460
it's rare. 180 degrees outside
right now. It is fucking toast.

1882
01:48:26,461 --> 01:48:30,000
I'm sweating in here. It's the same. I
feel bad for my car dude. It's insane.

1883
01:48:30,001 --> 01:48:32,910
It's so bad for my car. It's
so hot. How hot it is outside.

1884
01:48:32,911 --> 01:48:34,560
When I came to the door to unlock,

1885
01:48:34,561 --> 01:48:38,700
to get in the air conditioning from our
studio was billowing out and I could

1886
01:48:38,701 --> 01:48:41,150
feel it on my hand.
Why the fuck outside?

1887
01:48:41,580 --> 01:48:44,300
It's crazy cause it's really
the world's ending bro World.

1888
01:48:44,430 --> 01:48:48,270
Satan's coming Houston is,
we're living in Arizona now.

1889
01:48:48,360 --> 01:48:53,340
It's so fucking hot. Is this like,
is it going to keep getting worse?

1890
01:48:53,430 --> 01:48:57,930
Like at what point does it become
uninhabitable de la yesterday, my, uh,

1891
01:48:58,590 --> 01:49:02,310
like girls, dad was at the
house and he just goes, Brennan,

1892
01:49:02,340 --> 01:49:06,780
it's only gonna get worse. I'm like,
God, I just, the heat, just the world.

1893
01:49:06,870 --> 01:49:11,010
Everything. Is that true? That I disagree.
It's better than ever. I disagree.

1894
01:49:11,120 --> 01:49:14,010
There were like, I know things
look rough right now, but if you,

1895
01:49:14,240 --> 01:49:16,830
if you look for bad things,
you're going to find bad things.

1896
01:49:16,980 --> 01:49:18,870
Here's what I think is going to be to say,
Jamie,

1897
01:49:19,080 --> 01:49:22,800
whenever you see like a high temperature
like today and we don't beat the record

1898
01:49:22,801 --> 01:49:24,150
high, whatever that was, right?

1899
01:49:24,180 --> 01:49:29,050
I always think about what the fuck
was going on in 1927 when it was 172

1900
01:49:31,440 --> 01:49:36,440
bushes like fucking pussy
and dude's just like shit.

1901
01:49:37,081 --> 01:49:40,560
And more. If we get to wear three piece
suits and hats, like an ass holes,

1902
01:49:40,780 --> 01:49:45,360
imagine what George washing my days.
They had those fucking wigs. Oh yeah.

1903
01:49:45,720 --> 01:49:48,370
Powdered wigs. Yes. That
would go into the courtroom

1904
01:49:48,370 --> 01:49:51,130
with a powdered wig on with
no air conditioning. No AC.

1905
01:49:51,520 --> 01:49:54,910
That stupid wig and the full get up.
What is a powdered wig like?

1906
01:49:54,911 --> 01:49:57,820
What does that mean? Do they put
powder on the wig? What is a powder

1907
01:49:59,840 --> 01:50:03,460
powder and white? Yeah. Why did they
have powdered wigs like Google that?

1908
01:50:03,970 --> 01:50:08,290
That's a crazy, like a crazy tradition.
Who was, I gather. It looks tight, Bro.

1909
01:50:08,291 --> 01:50:11,970
It's what are you wearing bro? In
England? No. Do they wear them? They wear,

1910
01:50:11,971 --> 01:50:14,620
I'm super obvious where like you
can see their hair underneath.

1911
01:50:14,621 --> 01:50:18,940
They put a little effort. The powder made,
made, made them white or whatever color.

1912
01:50:18,960 --> 01:50:20,230
Okay.
In 18th century,

1913
01:50:20,231 --> 01:50:24,340
men's wigs were powdered to
give them their distinctive
white or off white color.

1914
01:50:24,460 --> 01:50:28,330
Women in the 18th century did not wear
wigs but war. How'd he say that word?

1915
01:50:28,960 --> 01:50:33,960
Co Fewer Co fure supplemented
by artificial hair or hair from,

1916
01:50:34,450 --> 01:50:34,601
oh,

1917
01:50:34,601 --> 01:50:39,601
they had a week after 1790 English
women seldom powdered their hair.

1918
01:50:40,180 --> 01:50:42,890
Why did people wear powdered wig?
Click on that mental floss. You know,

1919
01:50:42,891 --> 01:50:47,470
why the fuck would they do it and why
did they, what does that Peru keys,

1920
01:50:48,520 --> 01:50:51,820
powdered wigs called Peru keys were
all the rage. Look at that fucking wig.

1921
01:50:52,230 --> 01:50:56,380
They would wear the goofy, his wigs.
They would like, uh, like 1970s rockers.

1922
01:50:57,340 --> 01:51:01,330
How weird. Centuries powdered wigs
called Peru keys were all the rage.

1923
01:51:01,660 --> 01:51:05,140
The chic is that say how you
say that chick is chic, right?

1924
01:51:05,560 --> 01:51:08,980
Hairpiece cause I always hear chic,
I don't really read it that often.

1925
01:51:09,160 --> 01:51:11,950
She care piece would never
ever become popular. However,

1926
01:51:11,951 --> 01:51:14,320
if it hadn't been for a venereal disease,

1927
01:51:14,830 --> 01:51:19,150
a pair of self conscious kings
and poor hair hygiene. Wow.

1928
01:51:19,240 --> 01:51:24,240
The [inaudible] story begins like many
others with syphilis standard 1580,

1929
01:51:24,460 --> 01:51:28,540
the STD had become the worst epidemic
to strike Europe since the black death.

1930
01:51:28,570 --> 01:51:29,470
Oh my God.

1931
01:51:29,680 --> 01:51:34,060
These people were all fucking each other
to death according to William. William,

1932
01:51:34,061 --> 01:51:38,440
how do you say that name? Close clouds.
Uh, an infinite multitude of syphilis.

1933
01:51:38,441 --> 01:51:42,760
Patients Clog London's hospitals and
more filtered in each day without

1934
01:51:42,761 --> 01:51:47,650
antibiotics. Victims faced the full
brunt of the disease, open sores,

1935
01:51:47,770 --> 01:51:52,510
nasty rashes, blindness,
dementia, and patchy hair loss.

1936
01:51:52,900 --> 01:51:55,900
Baldness swept the land.
Whoa.

1937
01:51:55,930 --> 01:51:58,150
He was still rocking
these things at the time.

1938
01:51:58,151 --> 01:52:01,000
Hair loss was a one way ticket
to public embarrassment.

1939
01:52:01,001 --> 01:52:06,001
Long hair was a trendy status symbol and
a ball dome could stain any reputation

1940
01:52:07,451 --> 01:52:09,610
because they knew you had syphilis.
All my God.

1941
01:52:09,880 --> 01:52:13,720
When Samuel Pepys brother
acquired syphilis, the diarist,

1942
01:52:13,900 --> 01:52:18,190
what does that word diarist he writes
the areas for a living that said he does.

1943
01:52:18,220 --> 01:52:21,700
Or is it generally in the dairy
business? The first one. Well,

1944
01:52:21,760 --> 01:52:25,390
we'll Google it after we read
this. Okay. The diarist rope.

1945
01:52:25,810 --> 01:52:28,990
If my brother lives,
he will not be able to show his head,

1946
01:52:29,290 --> 01:52:32,530
which will be a very great shame to me.
Wow.

1947
01:52:32,710 --> 01:52:34,880
So this year was that big of
a deal because we were bald.

1948
01:52:34,881 --> 01:52:37,540
You were made fun of what
they do back then. Well, yeah,
that's true in the Bible.

1949
01:52:37,541 --> 01:52:39,580
You know,
God sent,

1950
01:52:39,610 --> 01:52:43,870
sent some bears to kill some kids because
they made fun of this dude for being

1951
01:52:43,871 --> 01:52:47,870
bald. Those part of the
dark shit. Hmm. So, uh,

1952
01:52:47,900 --> 01:52:52,900
Louis the 14th hired 48 wig makers
to save his image five years later.

1953
01:52:55,490 --> 01:53:00,200
So this was Louis. The 14th was
only 17 when his mop staff. Odd.

1954
01:53:00,260 --> 01:53:05,060
Terrible genetic. Yeah.
Not Good. Um, Louis Louise,

1955
01:53:05,090 --> 01:53:06,020
cousin Charles.

1956
01:53:06,021 --> 01:53:09,140
The second did the same thing when
his hair started going to gray.

1957
01:53:09,500 --> 01:53:11,210
Both men likely had syphilis.

1958
01:53:12,920 --> 01:53:16,010
Courtiers courtiers hmm.
I don't know what that word is.

1959
01:53:16,400 --> 01:53:20,990
And other aristocrats immediately
copied the two kings. Ah,

1960
01:53:21,080 --> 01:53:22,970
interesting.
They split it.

1961
01:53:22,971 --> 01:53:26,480
Wigs in the style trickled
down to the upper middleclass.

1962
01:53:26,690 --> 01:53:28,580
Europe's newest fad was born.

1963
01:53:28,880 --> 01:53:33,880
The cost of wigs increased and perks
became a scheme for flaunting wealth and

1964
01:53:34,761 --> 01:53:39,110
everyday wig cost about 25
shillings a week pay. Wow.

1965
01:53:39,380 --> 01:53:42,830
For Common Londoner.
So a couple grant for this fucking wig.

1966
01:53:43,400 --> 01:53:48,400
The bill for large elaborate Perutz
ballooned to as high as 800 shillings.

1967
01:53:49,600 --> 01:53:50,433
Whoa.

1968
01:53:50,570 --> 01:53:55,570
The word big wig was coined to describe
snobs who could afford big puffy Peru.

1969
01:53:57,790 --> 01:54:01,970
Still use that. Wow.
Poofy wig. That's crazy.

1970
01:54:02,210 --> 01:54:06,260
When that was from the 17 hundreds
when Lewis and Charles died,

1971
01:54:06,410 --> 01:54:10,040
wig stayed around like some story.
This is crazy.

1972
01:54:10,041 --> 01:54:14,000
Proofs remained popular because they
were so practical. They're so practical.

1973
01:54:14,750 --> 01:54:17,450
That's why I say about wigs
are so practical. He said,

1974
01:54:17,660 --> 01:54:21,890
this is just the thing to do
at the time. Head lice. Oh Wow.

1975
01:54:22,040 --> 01:54:27,040
Headlights were everywhere and nitpicking
was painful and time consuming wigs.

1976
01:54:27,171 --> 01:54:31,160
However, curb the problem, lice
stopped infesting people's hair,

1977
01:54:31,340 --> 01:54:34,190
which had to be shaved
for the proof to fit,

1978
01:54:34,270 --> 01:54:37,430
so everybody's shaved their head
and wore a wig. I said, no home.

1979
01:54:37,460 --> 01:54:39,470
They camped out on the wigs instead.

1980
01:54:39,680 --> 01:54:43,670
Delousing a wig was much easier
than delousing ahead of hair.

1981
01:54:43,970 --> 01:54:48,970
You send the dirty here piece to a wig
maker who had boiled the wig and remove

1982
01:54:49,171 --> 01:54:51,650
the knit.
That's where nitpicking came from.

1983
01:54:52,130 --> 01:54:56,770
The term nitpicking came from picking
the lies out of wigs, dropping some.

1984
01:54:57,020 --> 01:54:57,853
Damn.

1985
01:54:57,860 --> 01:55:01,880
This is just like when Callon does that
segment of your show dropping knowledge.

1986
01:55:01,960 --> 01:55:04,180
The first of all, you've got to
rename that. You didn't make it.

1987
01:55:04,630 --> 01:55:07,970
You got to rename that immediately.
You cannot say dropping knowledge.

1988
01:55:08,330 --> 01:55:10,550
We just can't. No. We should
call it to call him up.

1989
01:55:10,700 --> 01:55:14,030
We should call him up right now. Hey
Brian. Hey Brian. We've been talking.

1990
01:55:14,240 --> 01:55:15,070
We've been just no more drop.

1991
01:55:15,070 --> 01:55:18,200
When it's wonderful that you're sharing
these little tidbits of information,

1992
01:55:18,201 --> 01:55:22,140
but to announce that they're going to be
there in a segment and say we're going

1993
01:55:22,141 --> 01:55:25,580
to drop knowledge now you know why
your mats pops up out of the ground,

1994
01:55:25,581 --> 01:55:28,940
like a fucking check in the box or
you just regurgitate what hunter said.

1995
01:55:28,941 --> 01:55:33,350
He's like, what's up? And I had to get
drop knowledge. Do I have to do it?

1996
01:55:33,351 --> 01:55:36,470
So listeners when if they don't like
that to fast forward otherwise to just

1997
01:55:36,471 --> 01:55:39,860
spring it on you. So it's Kinda like,
you know, it's almost like an ad read.

1998
01:55:40,990 --> 01:55:43,420
So if you dig it, cool. Here
it comes. This is his or your,

1999
01:55:44,310 --> 01:55:49,310
cause I was getting to have the drop good
drop knowledge on it was mine because

2000
01:55:49,411 --> 01:55:51,850
he told them to start it
off as a segment. No, no.

2001
01:55:51,870 --> 01:55:54,630
I told them some of them are really
funny writer or interesting or fun. Yeah,

2002
01:55:54,670 --> 01:55:57,720
sometimes. Is it, is it a problem that
you used to do it in every episode?

2003
01:55:57,721 --> 01:55:58,291
Is that what it is?
Yeah.

2004
01:55:58,291 --> 01:56:02,040
So we'd be like in the middle of
talking about wigs in by, you know,

2005
01:56:02,430 --> 01:56:07,330
in France in 1940 and then it would go
off on this thing and kind of derail the

2006
01:56:07,331 --> 01:56:10,890
show. So I said that's interesting
though. Like if he told you that,

2007
01:56:11,070 --> 01:56:12,870
if he told you that, you'd be
like, wow, that'd be great.

2008
01:56:12,880 --> 01:56:17,390
No sprinkles in some stuff where people
like that's not true, man. So true stuff.

2009
01:56:17,820 --> 01:56:20,910
Oh, where's it, what's the not true
stuff? You know, it just depends on that.

2010
01:56:20,910 --> 01:56:24,330
So interesting. Yeah, it
just depends. So I figured,

2011
01:56:24,331 --> 01:56:27,900
might as well just label it so fans
know what's happening right now.

2012
01:56:27,960 --> 01:56:31,350
I'm not a fan of segments in
anything. Whenever he goes. Okay,

2013
01:56:31,351 --> 01:56:34,920
now we're going to go to the,
let's pretend you're a Mexican game

2014
01:56:37,700 --> 01:56:38,533
fan.
Well,

2015
01:56:38,670 --> 01:56:43,560
not a fan of like a thing that people
like do in the middle of a show. Well,

2016
01:56:43,610 --> 01:56:45,060
I mean, well it's for ours. You know,

2017
01:56:45,061 --> 01:56:46,830
we'll have our banter back
and forth like we have,

2018
01:56:46,831 --> 01:56:50,100
not for three hours because we don't do
it every day, but we'll do it. You know,

2019
01:56:50,101 --> 01:56:52,950
if he had the same person
every single day, it's tough.

2020
01:56:52,951 --> 01:56:54,240
Killed the three hours material.

2021
01:56:54,520 --> 01:56:57,880
You and I could do a podcast every day
for three hours, different animal Joe.

2022
01:56:57,881 --> 01:57:00,160
That's a Dev. You're talking
about you and just talk some shit,

2023
01:57:00,161 --> 01:57:03,210
some professional podcasts or say I'm
good at talking shit. It's what we do.

2024
01:57:03,570 --> 01:57:07,870
But are you saying cal is not, how
dare you? That's what he's saying.

2025
01:57:08,480 --> 01:57:11,490
What he's saying. I'm not saying
that we're into the same things.

2026
01:57:11,670 --> 01:57:14,070
You and I are under the same thing.
It's couns into you know,

2027
01:57:14,100 --> 01:57:15,230
but I'm in the same things.

2028
01:57:15,240 --> 01:57:18,390
A lot of the same things that into I'm
going down a weird road. You know what?

2029
01:57:19,740 --> 01:57:22,950
Listen Bro, listen, tell
the fascinating man.

2030
01:57:23,400 --> 01:57:25,650
But what would the current
events it gives us, Fred,

2031
01:57:25,830 --> 01:57:29,130
you know I started current events calendar
and keep up with current events like

2032
01:57:29,131 --> 01:57:31,020
he wouldn't know.
Um,

2033
01:57:31,050 --> 01:57:34,350
whatever today's current event
was like with pop culture.

2034
01:57:34,351 --> 01:57:37,530
Like he has no idea with what's going
on in the world because he's so into

2035
01:57:37,531 --> 01:57:41,220
history. That's where Jamie
comes. Exactly. Especially
if it's like black Twitter.

2036
01:57:41,480 --> 01:57:46,200
Yes, he is just on the ball. So
I'm kinda like, yeah, so exact.

2037
01:57:46,200 --> 01:57:50,460
So the idea is like Jamie introduced
you in a certain stuff like with sports,

2038
01:57:50,461 --> 01:57:55,170
like counter CNN sends out,
you know, whatever the fuck
he does. So I'll be like,

2039
01:57:55,230 --> 01:57:58,800
man, you didn't know. You know, people
flashes Dick. He's like, I have no idea.

2040
01:57:58,830 --> 01:58:01,170
Well he's into books and stuff,
which is admirable,

2041
01:58:01,200 --> 01:58:03,480
but that's why the show
works is he's into his thing.

2042
01:58:03,481 --> 01:58:05,940
I'm into my thing and cross pollinate,

2043
01:58:06,810 --> 01:58:11,070
cross pollinate because Paul is he, how
much is Brian into like MMA these days?

2044
01:58:11,760 --> 01:58:13,680
Uh, I don't know, like
the, and that's the,

2045
01:58:13,681 --> 01:58:16,140
that's the one of the reasons
why I started my own show
because I'd be like, Hey,

2046
01:58:16,141 --> 01:58:18,420
did you watch that fight we are covering?
He'd be like, no, I didn't see it.

2047
01:58:18,421 --> 01:58:20,580
Or you just see the
highlights. And I'm like, dude,

2048
01:58:20,581 --> 01:58:23,160
I'm getting balls deep into this.
We kind of have to,

2049
01:58:23,161 --> 01:58:28,110
if you're a fighter and the kid and you
grow like this giant MMA population of

2050
01:58:28,111 --> 01:58:31,020
like listeners. Yeah. But
you know, for a reason,

2051
01:58:31,021 --> 01:58:33,960
maybe he's busy or somebody who just
see the fights. It's tough when,

2052
01:58:34,210 --> 01:58:36,120
and that's how my show started.
I'd be breaking down a fight,

2053
01:58:36,121 --> 01:58:39,270
can pretty intricate into it and he'd go,
so you know,

2054
01:58:39,271 --> 01:58:42,010
just some beginners where I

2055
01:58:42,010 --> 01:58:43,770
couldn't really get into it.
You don't get, they left.

2056
01:58:43,780 --> 01:58:47,140
These motherfuckers know
this Saturday is January 2nd,

2057
01:58:47,470 --> 01:58:50,310
this Saturday,
January there is a January.

2058
01:58:50,311 --> 01:58:53,650
I did this because I'm thinking
of who's fine. I'm sorry.

2059
01:58:53,651 --> 01:58:57,670
I'm throwing triple tasking, podcasting
thinking and going through a taxi. Um, no.

2060
01:58:57,810 --> 01:59:02,650
Um, the Saturday, the second is UFC
fight night. It's definitely true.

2061
01:59:02,651 --> 01:59:07,651
Versus who is it to pull it up to
have a mother fucking fight companion.

2062
01:59:08,210 --> 01:59:12,410
That's the point, ladies
and gentlemen. But um,

2063
01:59:12,530 --> 01:59:16,090
we are not going to do a companion
for Edmonton because I uh,

2064
01:59:16,091 --> 01:59:18,940
that's why do they still have Jermaine
Germane to me on there? She slide.

2065
01:59:18,950 --> 01:59:22,690
The fight did shout she got
injured. She about, yes.

2066
01:59:23,200 --> 01:59:27,640
It's pulled out unspecified reasons by
the, it's speculated that it's an injury.

2067
01:59:27,730 --> 01:59:29,120
Speculate. It has to scale. Scale.

2068
01:59:29,160 --> 01:59:32,950
Well Hashtag maybe cyborgs
going to be attending.

2069
01:59:34,780 --> 01:59:39,070
Yeah. Okay. Yes. From placement,
late replacement for injured,

2070
01:59:39,071 --> 01:59:42,010
Germane to randomly, uh, Talita.

2071
01:59:42,040 --> 01:59:46,300
The Olivera has apparently agreed to
step in on short notice. Who is she?

2072
01:59:46,450 --> 01:59:48,910
Have you seen her fight before? I'll,
let me see the rest of the cards. Yeah,

2073
01:59:48,911 --> 01:59:53,290
let's go back to the card. All right,
here we go. What's the full card here?

2074
01:59:53,830 --> 01:59:57,880
Volkov uh, yeah. Yeah,

2075
01:59:57,940 --> 01:59:59,980
he was very good too, man.
He beat his last fight.

2076
01:59:59,981 --> 02:00:02,830
He beat Roy Nelson to
kind of a light card.

2077
02:00:04,870 --> 02:00:08,470
I'm just being honest. Feel like light
would be an understatement. Yeah, I agree.

2078
02:00:09,290 --> 02:00:11,290
Like Ooh,
but wait a minute.

2079
02:00:11,510 --> 02:00:15,910
Bev [inaudible] him off his fighting
and then you also got, uh, uh,

2080
02:00:16,040 --> 02:00:19,280
Calabar yeah.
Um,

2081
02:00:19,480 --> 02:00:22,630
click on that tie ties him off fight.
He has,

2082
02:00:22,631 --> 02:00:25,510
he's been out of the UFC for a while.
He's in the UFC fight pass prelims.

2083
02:00:25,511 --> 02:00:29,020
They go right there. Bam.
Yeah. Philippe's Silva.

2084
02:00:29,780 --> 02:00:34,090
I'm mayor back ties him off. Is a very
good fighter. She's very good. That's,

2085
02:00:34,091 --> 02:00:35,140
that's going to be an interesting fight.

2086
02:00:35,141 --> 02:00:40,030
I don't know too much about Philippe
Silva, but uh, this is Rotterdam, right?

2087
02:00:40,090 --> 02:00:42,700
This is where this is taking place.
That made a to be fun.

2088
02:00:42,790 --> 02:00:47,790
It's Callen town I think so we got to
get Eddie Bravo drunk and bring up the

2089
02:00:48,001 --> 02:00:52,810
conspiracies.
That never happens.

2090
02:00:53,440 --> 02:00:58,420
Um, all Bob Arena is fighting. That's
who's he fighting right next to that one.

2091
02:00:58,450 --> 02:01:03,100
That's borrower does not. Was that
uh, uh, Brian Barberino Liana Edwards.

2092
02:01:03,370 --> 02:01:06,400
Jamaica. Bam, Bam. Um, yeah.
You know, it's like God,

2093
02:01:06,401 --> 02:01:09,280
but I will watch it and I'll see
what we do. It's tough motherfucker.

2094
02:01:09,281 --> 02:01:13,660
I like watching him fight. Yeah,
that should be interesting.
Yeah, that'd be fun.

2095
02:01:14,050 --> 02:01:16,190
Either way.
A lot of these new spiking a fight pass.

2096
02:01:16,191 --> 02:01:20,710
Did you see your boy snoop Dogg
Tuck Shit to Conor McGregor?

2097
02:01:20,890 --> 02:01:25,030
No. So did he do, what did he do? Oh
my God. Can you bring that up Jamie?

2098
02:01:26,010 --> 02:01:29,960
How did his, how the UFC doesn't go
get the fuck off to his face. No,

2099
02:01:29,980 --> 02:01:33,430
he put blast sound. The Instagram real
fuck you. It, that's what happens.

2100
02:01:33,431 --> 02:01:38,431
A little bitch all like just oh know
snoop Dogg trashes Conor McGregor and

2101
02:01:38,810 --> 02:01:40,490
profane tirade.

2102
02:01:40,610 --> 02:01:44,750
Really? Kayla's here. This 1 million
views by the way. Ooh. Powerful.

2103
02:01:48,870 --> 02:01:49,703
No

2104
02:01:51,470 --> 02:01:54,400
mother fucking punk ass bitch

2105
02:01:56,470 --> 02:01:59,450
motherfucking shit. Nigga. Nigga.

2106
02:01:59,451 --> 02:02:03,440
That's what you get coming
to a motherfucking gang
fight with a butter knife.

2107
02:02:03,610 --> 02:02:06,730
Your bitch ass mother fucker.
Fuck you Nigga.

2108
02:02:07,490 --> 02:02:10,210
Shit Nigga.
What a party.

2109
02:02:12,520 --> 02:02:15,070
Yay.
Hi honey.

2110
02:02:18,080 --> 02:02:22,230
I got one.
I got one more report.

2111
02:02:22,690 --> 02:02:26,570
50 no Nigga named
macgregor bad motherfucker.

2112
02:02:27,080 --> 02:02:30,040
He got hard. He got horn. Oh fuck.

2113
02:02:31,680 --> 02:02:34,450
Well okay. What happened there?
Did you get schizophrenia?

2114
02:02:34,870 --> 02:02:38,650
Xe bipolar is a bad Malia.
One more rev left.

2115
02:02:39,720 --> 02:02:41,350
Wow.
Come on man.

2116
02:02:41,750 --> 02:02:45,040
I just don't get when people
celebrate like inside me.

2117
02:02:45,041 --> 02:02:48,220
The demise risky took.
It was a fun fight.

2118
02:02:48,540 --> 02:02:50,060
It was a fun fight.

2119
02:02:51,010 --> 02:02:54,670
The war brought the fight to Floyd and
it made it a fight is the biggest fight

2120
02:02:54,671 --> 02:02:56,550
of all.
Before we brought the fight to Connor.

2121
02:02:56,840 --> 02:03:00,340
I mean Floyd step forward with his hands
up and move towards him and constantly

2122
02:03:00,341 --> 02:03:04,120
created pressure. Kiandra also came
forward to man like they both brought it.

2123
02:03:04,240 --> 02:03:06,730
It was a very good fight. It was
very entertaining, very entertaining.

2124
02:03:06,731 --> 02:03:10,030
He hit Floyd more than any fighter hit
him and I think the right result took

2125
02:03:10,031 --> 02:03:13,510
place. A specialist, the
greatest specialist of all time,

2126
02:03:13,720 --> 02:03:18,640
beat a guy who is just not at his
league when it comes to that specialty,

2127
02:03:19,090 --> 02:03:19,781
you know?
I mean,

2128
02:03:19,781 --> 02:03:23,830
I think that's what we should have seen
and I think it was good for everybody.

2129
02:03:23,950 --> 02:03:27,880
I think it was great for Floyd because
there's the most entertaining Floyd fight

2130
02:03:28,060 --> 02:03:29,120
ever,
right?

2131
02:03:29,380 --> 02:03:34,380
It was a a great opportunity for him
to showcase his ability and to show

2132
02:03:35,201 --> 02:03:39,700
everybody what he can do.
I can get the 50th Win, get
the 50th win, and for Connor,

2133
02:03:39,790 --> 02:03:43,630
he got to show people that he
can hang for till he gets tired.

2134
02:03:43,840 --> 02:03:46,840
He can hang pretty well with
the best fighter of all time.

2135
02:03:46,870 --> 02:03:51,280
This is what else I think is cool is
Connor's going to take those boxing skills

2136
02:03:51,281 --> 02:03:54,850
and now bring it to the UFC.
Oh, and he's been on, there's,

2137
02:03:54,880 --> 02:03:59,080
there's no fight UFC can throw to
them that's going to be bigger.

2138
02:03:59,170 --> 02:04:01,180
There's just nothing.
You're not going to rattle him.

2139
02:04:01,181 --> 02:04:04,750
The moment can't get big enough for him.
So now, unless they give him Jon Jones,

2140
02:04:04,751 --> 02:04:08,050
Brock Lizard, like a tag team, some weird
random shit, which would be awesome.

2141
02:04:08,110 --> 02:04:12,280
However, there's nothing
they can do. Right. So now
he's learned from this. He's,

2142
02:04:12,310 --> 02:04:15,370
and he's a guy who learns from his
losses and brings that to the UFC.

2143
02:04:15,520 --> 02:04:19,540
I think he maybe has one, maybe two
left. But still you think so? Yeah.

2144
02:04:19,840 --> 02:04:22,630
I don't see him too. I mean when you have
100 million in the bank, he even said,

2145
02:04:22,631 --> 02:04:24,310
he goes,
unless I fucked things up,

2146
02:04:24,311 --> 02:04:27,370
I should be set for life and my kids and
their kids should be set for life. Yeah.

2147
02:04:27,430 --> 02:04:31,390
Yeah. So and he's very, you know,
self conscious of, you know,

2148
02:04:31,391 --> 02:04:34,960
the repercussions of sticking
around too long. He had a buddy,

2149
02:04:35,130 --> 02:04:39,060
he was a 10 of fight, a guy died.
So you know, I don't seem this.

2150
02:04:39,061 --> 02:04:43,680
The other thing with John being out now,
all the chips are in Connor's corner.

2151
02:04:43,710 --> 02:04:47,400
He's the only superstar, legit
superstar in town. He's like, listen,

2152
02:04:47,430 --> 02:04:50,460
you want me to fight again? I know that's
the old contract. This one I'm worth.

2153
02:04:50,461 --> 02:04:53,790
What do you guys want to do this?
The only way it's going to happen to him.

2154
02:04:53,850 --> 02:04:57,960
There is no second. Who else has
number two? Name a number two.

2155
02:04:57,961 --> 02:05:02,250
Joe [inaudible].
It might be steeper and that's time.

2156
02:05:02,310 --> 02:05:03,870
I mean he's the heavyweight champ.

2157
02:05:03,930 --> 02:05:06,960
I mean at least it's not
the doing kind of a global,

2158
02:05:06,990 --> 02:05:08,650
they're not even the same relevance.

2159
02:05:08,660 --> 02:05:12,750
He loves beside of the plan as far as
far as the draw. Yeah. Who else is there?

2160
02:05:12,960 --> 02:05:17,620
Who Bisbing who? George Saint
Pierre. Once you fight the Biz, Bang,

2161
02:05:17,820 --> 02:05:20,010
it had George and then people are going
to be a little disappointed with the

2162
02:05:20,011 --> 02:05:22,320
George numbers. I don't think
you can sell to all as you think.

2163
02:05:22,440 --> 02:05:26,520
I think the people that were
George Saint Pierre fans,

2164
02:05:26,700 --> 02:05:28,380
that's a long time ago,

2165
02:05:28,410 --> 02:05:31,560
over four years ago and the
sport is a different sport now.

2166
02:05:31,560 --> 02:05:34,320
You're talking to a lot of younger
people now that are just getting into it.

2167
02:05:34,400 --> 02:05:35,610
I like this old guy. It's fine. Cool.

2168
02:05:35,611 --> 02:05:38,040
He's fighting business doesn't really
make sense. Why? I'm the other guys.

2169
02:05:38,041 --> 02:05:41,610
I read this too.
She preview of the fight.

2170
02:05:41,970 --> 02:05:43,260
It was so douchey.

2171
02:05:43,620 --> 02:05:47,640
See the thing about that you see getting
bigger and some it's these fucking

2172
02:05:48,630 --> 02:05:53,630
sports guys who write these
really creatively negative
articles and it was about

2173
02:05:55,490 --> 02:06:00,120
the Bisping and you're saying you have
to read a Promo for the fight? Oh No, no,

2174
02:06:00,121 --> 02:06:04,380
I read it. Oh God, no, no,
no, not, I don't read promos.

2175
02:06:04,440 --> 02:06:09,210
When you see those promos, he's fret top
of the joint. 100% I don't have a plan.

2176
02:06:09,510 --> 02:06:12,960
I just say exactly what I think about
the fights. So like when I do those,

2177
02:06:12,961 --> 02:06:15,180
the best way to do it,
and I remember you telling me that.

2178
02:06:15,180 --> 02:06:18,570
So when showtime wanted me to cut a pro
for right before the fight, I was like,

2179
02:06:18,571 --> 02:06:20,910
let me just sit down and do it, man.
I don't want, just don't tend with do,

2180
02:06:20,911 --> 02:06:24,980
let me go. Let me think about what is at
stake, what is, what's it really means?

2181
02:06:25,350 --> 02:06:28,500
What's it mean to me? Like how do
I feel about, let me just go man.

2182
02:06:28,590 --> 02:06:30,750
And now shine through.
You know,

2183
02:06:30,780 --> 02:06:34,770
like when you talk about certain moments
that you've seen out of a fight or that

2184
02:06:34,771 --> 02:06:39,210
you show that shows like how special they
really are. It gets me excited. Yeah.

2185
02:06:39,211 --> 02:06:40,470
Like when you talk about like Anderson,

2186
02:06:40,471 --> 02:06:45,270
when he front kicked Vitor Belfort in the
face, like it was all electric moment,

2187
02:06:45,620 --> 02:06:49,830
you know that he's capable of doing
these movements that just look so much

2188
02:06:49,831 --> 02:06:52,830
faster and so much more accurate
than you expected. You know,

2189
02:06:52,831 --> 02:06:56,790
Anderson in his prime, some of his
performances, man, which is so stunning.

2190
02:06:56,910 --> 02:06:59,910
Now when I'm talking about back,
I like the, I don't need a what?

2191
02:06:59,911 --> 02:07:02,010
You tell me why I know
more than you guys do.

2192
02:07:02,011 --> 02:07:04,110
Who wrote this now and I'll tell you,
I'll tell you what I feel.

2193
02:07:04,140 --> 02:07:06,130
Nobody ever wrote anything
for him. No. Yeah, I bet.

2194
02:07:06,140 --> 02:07:09,030
So it should go away from the beginning
and that's why it comes off so good.

2195
02:07:09,230 --> 02:07:12,900
Yeah. When you hear a guy like reading
off a teleprompter and the beginning of a

2196
02:07:12,901 --> 02:07:16,260
fight, like the promo, the fight,
like when they're talking about what,

2197
02:07:16,290 --> 02:07:19,470
what's happening, what's at
stake, it just doesn't feel right.

2198
02:07:19,860 --> 02:07:23,580
Even if it's like kind of
crazy talk like teddy atlas,

2199
02:07:24,270 --> 02:07:27,420
like when Teddy Atlas least see
it's real. It's real. It's real.

2200
02:07:27,421 --> 02:07:29,100
You got to have real,
it's some crazy shit,

2201
02:07:29,101 --> 02:07:31,940
but it's really reading off
teleprompters is just paroled on what?

2202
02:07:31,950 --> 02:07:35,380
What was the thing you read though with
Bisbee and GSB [inaudible] on the fight.

2203
02:07:35,500 --> 02:07:36,190
It was just some

2204
02:07:36,190 --> 02:07:39,820
Douchey sports guy article
about it and I was like, ah.

2205
02:07:39,821 --> 02:07:43,630
It's saying that George Saint Pierre is
getting off his rocking chair to come

2206
02:07:43,631 --> 02:07:46,360
out and brown kick some. Nobody
in the head. I'm like, no, no.

2207
02:07:46,390 --> 02:07:49,720
He's coming out to fight George St Pierre.

2208
02:07:49,960 --> 02:07:52,060
Who is that car?
The stack.

2209
02:07:52,150 --> 02:07:55,150
George Saint Pierre Brothers coming out
of a retirement to fight Michael Bisping,

2210
02:07:55,151 --> 02:07:59,200
who's the UFC middleweight fucking
champion of the world widget midway.

2211
02:07:59,620 --> 02:08:02,350
He took it from Luke Rockhold like people.
You didn't say that you want,

2212
02:08:02,351 --> 02:08:05,650
but he still took the belt and then go
out, but the only defendant gets Dan him.

2213
02:08:05,720 --> 02:08:08,980
What? Who Cares Jed? He
beat him. He did? Yeah.

2214
02:08:09,040 --> 02:08:13,390
He's a legit straight lineage.
185 pound champ of the world.

2215
02:08:13,960 --> 02:08:18,640
You know, I don't, I just, when I
see that fight, I just add it again.

2216
02:08:18,641 --> 02:08:19,980
Go on my tours and just get seen.

2217
02:08:19,990 --> 02:08:23,170
The actual reaction face face
with fans when I talked about it.

2218
02:08:23,200 --> 02:08:26,110
It's very Luke warm. Yeah.
What do you guys think?

2219
02:08:26,680 --> 02:08:28,930
We got away for Robert
Whitaker to heal up, you know,

2220
02:08:28,931 --> 02:08:31,180
he's the interim champ and
that's going to be a while.

2221
02:08:31,181 --> 02:08:35,530
His knees pretty fucked apparently. So
he's got to heal up his name and you know,

2222
02:08:35,560 --> 02:08:39,730
once that's done then you know, you get
to see what happens after Bisbing fights.

2223
02:08:39,731 --> 02:08:43,160
GSP. Here's the thing though that
with, with Biz and I love busy man.

2224
02:08:43,161 --> 02:08:46,780
I wish she was a bigger draw, but
Bisbing ratio, not huge ratings.

2225
02:08:46,781 --> 02:08:48,970
Bisbing verse Robert Whittaker,
not huge ratings.

2226
02:08:48,971 --> 02:08:50,290
It's like there's nothing
you can really do.

2227
02:08:50,291 --> 02:08:54,790
The WHO's Luke Rockhold fight and again,
he's fighting uh, uh, David Branch.

2228
02:08:54,850 --> 02:08:57,590
That's right. That's an
interesting fight. That's system.

2229
02:08:57,740 --> 02:09:00,690
That's September what the 16th
or something like that. Yeah,

2230
02:09:00,850 --> 02:09:04,930
and they brand from world's Citi is fine.
His first fight in UFC was terrible,

2231
02:09:04,931 --> 02:09:08,310
but it's also his first, you know, in a
long time. He a world series champion,

2232
02:09:08,360 --> 02:09:11,950
light heavyweight and middleweight.
Yeah. So you know, he'll,

2233
02:09:11,951 --> 02:09:16,200
Gerald Harris knocked him out with a
slam and his first UFC fight weight,

2234
02:09:16,480 --> 02:09:21,300
rough UFC career left, you know,
did work and world series, you know,

2235
02:09:21,310 --> 02:09:24,670
for Luke Rocco. I think it's just, it's
more of him just getting back into things,

2236
02:09:26,110 --> 02:09:29,980
but he can't take this kid light.
No, no. Luxo talented man. Yeah,

2237
02:09:30,070 --> 02:09:32,220
he is so fucking silly. Talented. Yeah.

2238
02:09:32,410 --> 02:09:34,960
David Branch has won a
lot of fights in a row.

2239
02:09:35,050 --> 02:09:38,890
Lost Anthony Johnson by decision for,
that's pretty crazy.

2240
02:09:39,190 --> 02:09:42,010
Lost a loss as a light
heavyweight to Anthony Johnson.

2241
02:09:42,011 --> 02:09:46,390
Go Up to a Hardee's ripped his leg off.
He, yeah, he caught him though. Yeah.

2242
02:09:46,540 --> 02:09:51,130
And World series, right? Yeah. There
you go. No UFC. Oh, that's right.

2243
02:09:51,131 --> 02:09:54,010
He got heel hook. Quite
bad. Yeah. And he's a black,

2244
02:09:54,011 --> 02:09:56,380
he's a black belt on the
ground to second round. Huh?

2245
02:09:56,620 --> 02:09:59,530
One 44 I felt like I was the first round.

2246
02:09:59,890 --> 02:10:04,750
You just see 16 Paul Harris more
than once. No, just one time.

2247
02:10:04,780 --> 02:10:07,000
Yeah. Okay. Gerald Harris.
So that's where it is.

2248
02:10:07,001 --> 02:10:11,080
Gerald Harris knocked him out in UFC
one 16 lesbian Lesnar versus Carwyn.

2249
02:10:11,170 --> 02:10:15,520
Wow. It's a while ago. Fuck yeah,
that was, that's right. Kale Slam.

2250
02:10:15,970 --> 02:10:17,170
Yup. Yeah, I remember that.

2251
02:10:17,171 --> 02:10:20,350
I think that got knocked to the night
cause I thought I was gonna get it cause

2252
02:10:20,351 --> 02:10:22,690
that was really that kind
of knock out nine to slam.

2253
02:10:22,691 --> 02:10:26,260
I'm pretty sure that the Kale Slam weird
got an award for that. Interesting.

2254
02:10:26,470 --> 02:10:29,200
So score go up,
go up all the way to the top.

2255
02:10:29,440 --> 02:10:33,160
He has his hands full with the graph.
So yes he does. So he beat Vinnie,

2256
02:10:34,130 --> 02:10:37,780
who's a phenomenal submission artist.
Who else?

2257
02:10:37,810 --> 02:10:42,810
DP Christoph Jackto decent fighter
nine at the time or 10 at the time.

2258
02:10:43,281 --> 02:10:47,370
But that just shows you where
the middleweight division
split decision now he

2259
02:10:47,371 --> 02:10:51,770
beat on. Yeah, but you should know,
Cami has never been the same. He,

2260
02:10:51,771 --> 02:10:54,680
Jesse Taylor, who's
the, you know the champ,

2261
02:10:54,980 --> 02:10:58,880
but you should know Cami
after he got stopped by, um,

2262
02:11:00,050 --> 02:11:02,510
Tim Boetsch, Tim Boetsch and then
he gets stopped by Jacques Rey.

2263
02:11:02,580 --> 02:11:06,170
You got brutally stop bad then he
left. Yeah, he just wasn't the same.

2264
02:11:06,320 --> 02:11:10,580
And that's all, all of that is after
Anderson mark. Correct. But I mean,

2265
02:11:10,581 --> 02:11:13,940
you look at David Branch compared to
Luke rock colds lineup. It's insane.

2266
02:11:13,970 --> 02:11:14,930
Luke Rockhold.
I mean,

2267
02:11:14,931 --> 02:11:19,310
big difference in the world know this
is a terrible match up for David Branch.

2268
02:11:19,700 --> 02:11:24,170
And unless he can rise to the occasion
like that,

2269
02:11:24,171 --> 02:11:26,990
he wasn't talking a lot of shit
to each other to have a yeah.

2270
02:11:27,920 --> 02:11:31,150
Talking Alonda Shit.
Weidman.

2271
02:11:31,420 --> 02:11:36,420
Machida Bisbing Boetsch Philipo he
hasn't fought since December of 2000 Oh,

2272
02:11:36,531 --> 02:11:40,730
January of 2016 June. Sorry. The wild man.

2273
02:11:41,090 --> 02:11:43,100
And then before that he's
on the muckraker card.

2274
02:11:43,340 --> 02:11:47,660
When you fought Weidman Gregor Aldo, that
was the best performance of his career.

2275
02:11:48,320 --> 02:11:52,260
Beat the shit she hopes for that.
Two more that I thought.

2276
02:11:52,450 --> 02:11:56,880
I thought he looked at his best.
He also fuck the big thing up here.

2277
02:11:56,881 --> 02:11:59,760
I choked him out with one arm. Yeah.
Had kicked him to choke down a low.

2278
02:11:59,830 --> 02:12:04,040
Cut Him with that question mark.
Yeah. Applying and then Tim Boetsch,

2279
02:12:04,130 --> 02:12:07,790
you fucked him up with Tim. Tim Bullshit
fucked him up with an inverted triangle.

2280
02:12:07,791 --> 02:12:12,740
Kimora that cut. That has the
Philip who fight the body.

2281
02:12:13,240 --> 02:12:17,630
They have to talk Costa into walking out
to take that fight. Fight. Yeah. Why not?

2282
02:12:17,960 --> 02:12:19,030
He just didn't,
he was over it.

2283
02:12:19,031 --> 02:12:20,810
He didn't want to fight anymore
and my manager was like, dude,

2284
02:12:20,811 --> 02:12:23,480
if you don't walk out there, this will
take a career for the rest of your life.

2285
02:12:23,510 --> 02:12:26,780
Wow. And he was literally not
going to fight. He was like,

2286
02:12:26,781 --> 02:12:29,870
I'm not going to call his name.
He's like, I'm like going. Wow.

2287
02:12:29,871 --> 02:12:32,840
Aleks Mcmahon was like, you better get
your ass out there. I'm telling you, you,

2288
02:12:32,841 --> 02:12:35,900
you're going to regret this for the rest
of your life if you don't grab the why

2289
02:12:35,901 --> 02:12:39,020
did he not want to go out there? I think
he's just over it. The nerves, everything.

2290
02:12:39,021 --> 02:12:41,540
He was like, I don't wanna
do this anymore. Then Luke
Rockhold was like, here,

2291
02:12:41,541 --> 02:12:44,530
let me help you at Gish liver
kick get out of here. Yeah.

2292
02:12:44,900 --> 02:12:48,340
That's the business we're in. Oh
Shit. And he didn't want to go.

2293
02:12:48,360 --> 02:12:52,130
There's a decision that people make when
they've taken too much punishment and

2294
02:12:52,131 --> 02:12:54,730
then they just can't get excited
about performing anymore.

2295
02:12:54,740 --> 02:12:56,780
And it can't get up excited
about competing anymore.

2296
02:12:57,230 --> 02:13:00,320
There's a decision that people make
where once they make that decision,

2297
02:13:00,620 --> 02:13:03,680
you got to just get out because you will
never be the guy that you were when you

2298
02:13:03,681 --> 02:13:07,880
didn't give a fuck and you were hungry
and young and you're gonna run into that

2299
02:13:07,881 --> 02:13:10,700
guy, you're gonna run into that
guy, that guy that was you.

2300
02:13:10,760 --> 02:13:12,920
You're going to run into
him. He's there. Yeah.

2301
02:13:15,140 --> 02:13:17,960
He couldn't even tell what cost to Philip
who looked normal and that fight looks

2302
02:13:17,961 --> 02:13:20,030
like he's trying to win.
Think like once you get in there,

2303
02:13:20,031 --> 02:13:23,180
it's kind of fight or flight, you know?
Yeah. I mean it goes back to his instinct.

2304
02:13:23,210 --> 02:13:26,650
Oh boy. Luke Rockhold is a very good
left kick to the body. His Great, Oh,

2305
02:13:26,720 --> 02:13:27,553
who was illegal?

2306
02:13:27,760 --> 02:13:30,390
It's legal kick to the body when
you're on the grounds leading up, man,

2307
02:13:30,400 --> 02:13:34,290
that kind kinda hit his head, but yeah.
Did it. Yeah. Go back to your phrase. Dot.

2308
02:13:34,300 --> 02:13:35,133
Okay.

2309
02:13:35,670 --> 02:13:36,503
The very end of it.

2310
02:13:37,900 --> 02:13:42,650
Powerful Vimeo. Not that it mattered.
How's that? How's this legally online? Oh,

2311
02:13:43,010 --> 02:13:46,450
how dare you. Yeah, you're right. Right
behind the shoulder blade. That's legal.

2312
02:13:46,480 --> 02:13:49,230
Yeah. It's kind of weird that
you could do that. You're not,

2313
02:13:49,300 --> 02:13:52,240
can you stomp to body when he
goes down? Not really. Right? No.

2314
02:13:52,300 --> 02:13:55,210
You can ask kick though, Lupe.
Oh, that's right. You can,

2315
02:13:55,440 --> 02:13:59,410
can you like push stomp kicks
such bullshit in it. Can you like,

2316
02:13:59,411 --> 02:14:03,220
if you can't go down stomp,
but can you stomp forward?

2317
02:14:03,370 --> 02:14:06,040
You can do it on your feet because it's
kind of like a front kid. It's weird.

2318
02:14:06,400 --> 02:14:08,980
It's kind of dumb. Right?
That's weird. Anyways,

2319
02:14:08,981 --> 02:14:12,760
I think I liked it with brands where
I think Luke, Merck, so interesting.

2320
02:14:13,180 --> 02:14:17,400
But again, Luke's not a huge paper view.
Frolic for the UFC and champion out.

2321
02:14:17,420 --> 02:14:19,990
You're like, yeah, Luke has every
reason he should be. I don't get it.

2322
02:14:20,260 --> 02:14:23,260
But with John being out, just
go, go through the champs.

2323
02:14:23,261 --> 02:14:27,220
They got mighty mouse ain't happening.
No time. No time. They're banking them.

2324
02:14:27,250 --> 02:14:29,680
No Time's coming up.
So I had two fights.

2325
02:14:30,510 --> 02:14:33,220
Louie that for right in
the UFC. Yeah. Is it for,

2326
02:14:34,060 --> 02:14:38,580
I think he's had he fought Meesha?
No Sir.

2327
02:14:39,850 --> 02:14:42,520
Tim. He stopped. Um,

2328
02:14:45,130 --> 02:14:49,810
yeah. How many fights did you have
in the UFC? It's not pulling up.

2329
02:14:51,000 --> 02:14:55,240
It doesn't say, Oh yeah, just
go to his Wikipedia. I guess.

2330
02:14:55,810 --> 02:14:59,140
I feel like he's had two fights
in the UFC. Maybe said three.

2331
02:14:59,170 --> 02:15:03,790
Three of might have had three. Three. You
might be right. It's not a lot though.

2332
02:15:03,910 --> 02:15:07,390
I agree. It's not a lot.
There was this lady there.

2333
02:15:08,730 --> 02:15:12,960
Okay. Oh, as him split decisions.
Rose p. That's right. That's right.

2334
02:15:12,961 --> 02:15:15,890
That was a fight he took on short
notice. You Fun belts. I remember that.

2335
02:15:15,970 --> 02:15:20,100
That was in Houston. That's right. But
that's just been Merkin death. God,

2336
02:15:20,101 --> 02:15:23,460
he's just, but you look at the
division, there's just nothing for him.

2337
02:15:23,461 --> 02:15:27,750
So he has to fight desperate or DC.
Well, Merkin Misha is not as impressive.

2338
02:15:27,751 --> 02:15:31,110
All the Mishi has a very good striker
and a very good submission artist.

2339
02:15:31,111 --> 02:15:33,570
He's really good submissions.
But that was like, okay.

2340
02:15:33,600 --> 02:15:36,150
He caught that dude coming in, clipped
him with one punch, knocked him out.

2341
02:15:36,240 --> 02:15:40,710
That's oppressive. But doing it the Jimmy
man and why you got to go, oh, okay,

2342
02:15:40,740 --> 02:15:43,920
this guy's fucking for real.
Like if he could do that to Manoa,

2343
02:15:43,921 --> 02:15:46,080
he could do that to a lot of people think.
Yeah,

2344
02:15:46,110 --> 02:15:47,580
I want to see him do
it to someone else too.

2345
02:15:47,580 --> 02:15:50,220
Obviously you want to see
him fight next level stuff.

2346
02:15:50,221 --> 02:15:52,940
You know what I think's going to
happen and I do like him. I chill.

2347
02:15:52,941 --> 02:15:55,260
I hope he comes champ.
Be hilarious for many of reasons,

2348
02:15:55,261 --> 02:15:59,970
but I think you know his technique of
Russia and like that you get to a certain

2349
02:15:59,971 --> 02:16:01,930
level where it has like
DC and Gusto and go,

2350
02:16:01,931 --> 02:16:04,590
you want me to do what I think
get fucked up. Well that's,

2351
02:16:04,670 --> 02:16:07,830
we can see that led to it.
But here's the thing about that level.

2352
02:16:07,831 --> 02:16:12,060
There's levels to this game and light
heavyweight goes DC, John Jones,

2353
02:16:12,090 --> 02:16:17,090
Gus van DC and then and the second level
and then after that I can free for all.

2354
02:16:18,570 --> 02:16:22,560
Yeah, like what does DC do now? Like if
they give him back this high low again,

2355
02:16:23,060 --> 02:16:27,240
it's tea, but this is the thing in the
public's eyes, it's such a tough sell.

2356
02:16:27,241 --> 02:16:30,040
Like here's the best light
everywhere. World new ones like, nope.

2357
02:16:30,040 --> 02:16:34,480
We've seen him lose twice.
Now we see him get put to sleep by John.

2358
02:16:34,481 --> 02:16:37,270
The second fight you want
worst case scenario for you.

2359
02:16:37,271 --> 02:16:40,300
And I think DC's the late every, all
the time we take out. John, do you want,

2360
02:16:40,301 --> 02:16:43,330
you want to tell you what we're
skipping now they go tainted,

2361
02:16:43,370 --> 02:16:46,300
Supplement Dick pills again,
six months, a set suspension.

2362
02:16:46,301 --> 02:16:47,900
We're going to strip the belt from ya DC.

2363
02:16:47,920 --> 02:16:51,960
Here's about you gotta fight John
Again. Six months. Go get you something

2364
02:16:53,940 --> 02:16:56,590
here.
Just give me that Goddamn belt back.

2365
02:16:57,420 --> 02:17:01,300
Give me my fucking dealt that like
that's okay. But here's the thing.

2366
02:17:01,630 --> 02:17:06,560
We don't know what was really going on
now, right? We don't know with John. Yeah.

2367
02:17:06,970 --> 02:17:11,970
Now I think we are allowed
to have complete open
speculation with zero concern

2368
02:17:14,770 --> 02:17:18,340
for being respectful. Yes. I think after
the Dick pulled thing, I go, look man,

2369
02:17:18,341 --> 02:17:21,200
they do was party and he was taking
some Dick Pills. It's like, oh, coke,

2370
02:17:21,250 --> 02:17:23,080
I don't give a fuck about coke.
That's not helping you.

2371
02:17:23,480 --> 02:17:27,960
Then you hear about this and you go,
wait a minute, something's going on.

2372
02:17:28,840 --> 02:17:31,480
What is this? Yeah. I want
to know what this kid's like.

2373
02:17:31,481 --> 02:17:33,880
JDS got flagged right and they
pulled them off France, you know,

2374
02:17:34,090 --> 02:17:36,910
I only get jds go, come on. All
right. That's steroids for sure.

2375
02:17:36,920 --> 02:17:40,350
Because he's at a clean history with
John. It's one thing after another. Well,

2376
02:17:40,400 --> 02:17:43,780
jds also got flagged for a
diuretic. Yeah. I'm just saying,

2377
02:17:43,781 --> 02:17:47,890
let's say they didn't say
anyone's was trace amounts,
trace amounts, but with jds,

2378
02:17:47,920 --> 02:17:50,890
again, benefit of the doubt. All right.
It happened once, whatever, but John,

2379
02:17:50,891 --> 02:17:54,040
it's like come on Bro.
And then and then with the Dick Pills,

2380
02:17:54,130 --> 02:17:58,240
a lot of people are like, ah, that's kind
of covering up the third row, you know,

2381
02:17:58,480 --> 02:18:01,630
recovery therapy for when your
on intestines, testosterone
and stuff like that.

2382
02:18:01,630 --> 02:18:05,140
Like that's a little shady, whatever.
Put that to the side. Now it's like,

2383
02:18:05,141 --> 02:18:08,710
come on man. Well this is a
weird one because this one is,

2384
02:18:08,711 --> 02:18:13,711
if he was taking what you describe as
some short acting quick leaving your

2385
02:18:14,921 --> 02:18:19,600
system, steroid, some drug that makes
you aggressive, you've got to go. Okay.

2386
02:18:20,080 --> 02:18:23,410
How long was he doing as far I did.
Was He doing this during training?

2387
02:18:24,130 --> 02:18:26,260
This amp him up,
this help his work rate.

2388
02:18:26,530 --> 02:18:29,020
Did this make you more aggressive
and more confident in training?

2389
02:18:29,021 --> 02:18:32,140
Did it add to his confidence when
he was fighting? Like what is this?

2390
02:18:32,320 --> 02:18:35,170
We don't know. We were, we know
that story that shale son told,

2391
02:18:35,650 --> 02:18:38,410
you know that story of the Chelsea and
told them my podcast about John being

2392
02:18:38,470 --> 02:18:41,860
under the entire,
like under the octagon when the,

2393
02:18:41,861 --> 02:18:44,980
when the Sata kicked him out of luck
and pissed under that gun right there.

2394
02:18:44,980 --> 02:18:47,890
This is what they wanted to
do. They, they knew that he,

2395
02:18:47,891 --> 02:18:50,380
this was before you had to
expose your whereabouts.

2396
02:18:50,560 --> 02:18:52,570
He didn't have to disclose
your whereabouts back then.

2397
02:18:53,080 --> 02:18:55,240
So when they showed up at the gym,

2398
02:18:55,510 --> 02:18:59,980
John Apparently saw them pull up
and went underneath the octagon.

2399
02:19:00,280 --> 02:19:02,260
He thought they would leave.
They didn't leave.

2400
02:19:02,261 --> 02:19:06,890
They stayed the entire time
and they waited for the gym
to close the gym clothes

2401
02:19:06,891 --> 02:19:09,550
to shut the lights out.
And then John came out of the office.

2402
02:19:09,551 --> 02:19:13,480
He's crust chill and says chills is
really not a liar either. Besides,

2403
02:19:13,481 --> 02:19:15,880
if he's telling me he's not taking
steroids when he's fighting. Yeah.

2404
02:19:15,910 --> 02:19:19,860
I don't know if he got it from,
I dunno.

2405
02:19:19,870 --> 02:19:22,600
What source channels using,
he's pretty reliable, right?

2406
02:19:22,960 --> 02:19:25,840
He's definitely in the know,
right? I agree. I don't know.

2407
02:19:26,410 --> 02:19:28,130
I don't know if it's true or not,
but it makes

2408
02:19:28,130 --> 02:19:32,750
you think like, okay, well what is
that for? Is that for pot? You know,

2409
02:19:33,230 --> 02:19:38,180
Marty was, he wears a coat, cope with
their smoke. There's this much smoke.

2410
02:19:38,181 --> 02:19:41,210
I'm going to go, what's going on
here? Right. What is going on? Yeah.

2411
02:19:41,240 --> 02:19:44,570
How about jail sown and he, when
we had the press conference, he,

2412
02:19:44,571 --> 02:19:47,480
this is four days before the fight.
We're both work. He's working for,

2413
02:19:47,481 --> 02:19:51,710
I think ESPN for the Mayweather stuff. I'm
work for. Showtime comes by, he goes, Yo,

2414
02:19:51,980 --> 02:19:54,140
Max Kellerman they didn't
take you on $100,000 bet.

2415
02:19:54,170 --> 02:19:57,500
He'll win more than went around a more,
right. I went, no. He goes, I'll take it.

2416
02:19:57,830 --> 02:20:00,380
I went, jail. You take this bed, you're
going to fucking pay me. He goes,

2417
02:20:00,381 --> 02:20:02,870
I swear to God I will pay shakes my hand.
He goes,

2418
02:20:03,230 --> 02:20:07,670
if Mcgregor Mcgregor wins one round or
more, you give me $100,000 he goes, yeah,

2419
02:20:07,671 --> 02:20:10,820
he's not going to touch them.
He's not gonna win around.
Cool man. Shake his hand.

2420
02:20:11,450 --> 02:20:12,950
And after the fight,
he was literally like,

2421
02:20:12,951 --> 02:20:16,250
you just text me yesterday morning
because, hey bro, I'll be in la.

2422
02:20:16,251 --> 02:20:18,620
I dropped the cash off. I'm like,
you don't have to pay me, man.

2423
02:20:19,040 --> 02:20:22,700
It's not that sense. He was dead
serious. He, I'll drop the cash off.

2424
02:20:22,701 --> 02:20:24,600
You said no to a hundred
thousand dollars yeah.

2425
02:20:24,990 --> 02:20:28,220
He think he would have said no to
you. I do. He would have made you pay.

2426
02:20:28,280 --> 02:20:32,600
I do this type of fucking,
nope. I'm telling you this.
This type of dude chill is,

2427
02:20:32,760 --> 02:20:36,440
remember when Shaylin Nate [inaudible].
Nate fell on hard times.

2428
02:20:36,890 --> 02:20:41,750
Chail set without Nate Marquardt
pipe markup. Yeah. Yeah.

2429
02:20:41,810 --> 02:20:44,840
Sending him a check in the mail. It
was, I can and go through hard times.

2430
02:20:44,841 --> 02:20:47,090
Here's some money.
So when he helped my friend,

2431
02:20:47,120 --> 02:20:50,620
like he's always had a free pass with
me. Oh, that's really nice of you.

2432
02:20:51,200 --> 02:20:54,740
Very nice of you. It muscle rich.
Whoa, just kidding. Not Rowing in.

2433
02:20:55,310 --> 02:20:58,720
That's crew g one screw g here,
but now lots of Conor McGregor rich.

2434
02:20:59,750 --> 02:21:04,400
Who is these days? Whoa. Connor one
fight. Richard a new son. How about Floyd?

2435
02:21:04,940 --> 02:21:06,560
Alan? He's a billionaire, but yeah,

2436
02:21:06,561 --> 02:21:09,230
Floyd is probably worth like
$500 million now or something.

2437
02:21:09,500 --> 02:21:13,040
But they said that he owed money to the
IRS. I talked to him about that. He goes,

2438
02:21:13,340 --> 02:21:17,360
he was literally like, dude, my taxes,
it's, you know, it's the same equivalent.

2439
02:21:17,361 --> 02:21:20,660
If they flagged us. He's like,
you pay like whatever, 5,000 just,

2440
02:21:20,750 --> 02:21:24,020
I make so much money. I owe 5
million. I can pay it whenever.

2441
02:21:24,021 --> 02:21:27,590
It just got blown up in the news. He's
like, no one's broke here for God's sakes.

2442
02:21:27,970 --> 02:21:31,010
It's like a legit point, sir. Good
point. Go ahead. Someone was watching.

2443
02:21:31,810 --> 02:21:33,670
He can keep up that lifestyle though.

2444
02:21:33,700 --> 02:21:37,460
Would that kind of
spending spending's insane.

2445
02:21:37,490 --> 02:21:40,000
It's not Johnny Depp Insane.
Like there's Johnny Depp.

2446
02:21:40,340 --> 02:21:41,390
Remember we've been over that.

2447
02:21:41,391 --> 02:21:45,830
That's some shit ball like 14 houses.

2448
02:21:45,860 --> 02:21:48,530
There's Johnny Depp and say,
and then there's Floyd. Johnny.

2449
02:21:48,531 --> 02:21:50,060
How about two about two houses.

2450
02:21:50,540 --> 02:21:53,030
Floyd Mayweather become boxing's
first billion dollar fighter.

2451
02:21:53,060 --> 02:21:57,620
Can you name the other billion athletes?
Uh, tiger woods. Michael Jordan,

2452
02:21:57,930 --> 02:22:02,570
tiger woods, which was surprising
me. She got 500 million.

2453
02:22:02,630 --> 02:22:07,130
Come on. At least that'd be a
savage. Nah, she savage. But taxes.

2454
02:22:07,131 --> 02:22:09,380
If you don't really have a
billion when you have a true,

2455
02:22:09,410 --> 02:22:10,610
you have a shitload of money.

2456
02:22:13,280 --> 02:22:15,350
She got a hundred [inaudible].
She had two Hundo.

2457
02:22:15,480 --> 02:22:17,130
Ooh,

2458
02:22:17,320 --> 02:22:20,630
that bitch crazy too. In this car
with clubs and shit. Wow. Well,

2459
02:22:20,640 --> 02:22:23,830
he kind of deserved it. Made me, she gets
a little upset. So you got Arnold Palmer,

2460
02:22:23,831 --> 02:22:26,430
Jack Nukes and tiger.
Michael Jordan

2461
02:22:27,150 --> 02:22:31,920
made a billion knocking out a little ball
off that dirt off that delicious drink.

2462
02:22:32,100 --> 02:22:34,050
Oh, that's right. No,
no, I'm just kidding.

2463
02:22:34,051 --> 02:22:38,140
Tiger Woods estimated at
100 million chunk chunk.

2464
02:22:39,480 --> 02:22:43,110
It's a lot. It's a lot
of cash. Baby baby sat.

2465
02:22:43,380 --> 02:22:46,700
That's a lot of cash.
Bay Bay, Bay Bay set.

2466
02:22:46,920 --> 02:22:49,870
Did you see that video and tiger got
arrested for drunk driving. You know,

2467
02:22:49,880 --> 02:22:53,820
it's hilarious. He's just fucked
up on pill he was on. Did you see,

2468
02:22:53,910 --> 02:22:55,980
I think they found six things in a system.

2469
02:22:56,220 --> 02:22:59,450
Why did he drive on pain pills?

2470
02:22:59,480 --> 02:23:03,690
Because tiger woods who told them tiger
woods but doesn't he know like, Bro,

2471
02:23:03,691 --> 02:23:07,200
you just got back surgery and you're
taking like heavy duty opiates or whatever

2472
02:23:07,201 --> 02:23:09,600
the fuck they're given that he's taken.
What was he taking?

2473
02:23:09,660 --> 02:23:14,660
He was taking a barge or ship
a fulls eyes or show fuck dude.

2474
02:23:15,510 --> 02:23:19,830
Time Shave your head. Take it
from another bald guy. Let it go.

2475
02:23:20,010 --> 02:23:24,780
It's like that song from the movie
frozen. Let it go. Let it go.

2476
02:23:24,990 --> 02:23:28,180
Can you just got to ditch that shit?
Yeah.

2477
02:23:28,770 --> 02:23:32,660
I mean he's not good looking guy anyway.
He terrible bro.

2478
02:23:32,810 --> 02:23:35,310
He would worry about that
nonsense you got going on there.

2479
02:23:35,380 --> 02:23:38,460
Just go ahead and wear glasses.
If I was to Cochise too, man,

2480
02:23:38,461 --> 02:23:41,040
like you have $1 billion bro.

2481
02:23:41,140 --> 02:23:44,280
He gets 100 million but clear
glasses that Connor was wearing.

2482
02:23:44,750 --> 02:23:48,210
Some of those like Dave Chappelle's
went some that I definitely want to get

2483
02:23:48,240 --> 02:23:48,510
there.

2484
02:23:48,510 --> 02:23:52,350
It was like a brown for frame and they
weren't so dark where their sunglasses,

2485
02:23:52,640 --> 02:23:56,520
they were like tinted were look cool.
You get those. If you have a cock guy,

2486
02:23:56,570 --> 02:24:00,630
know what the move is.
He goes with like yellow aviators,

2487
02:24:00,631 --> 02:24:01,980
hunter s Thompson style,

2488
02:24:02,700 --> 02:24:07,120
and just starts dressing like Johnny
Depp and just starts flaunting the fact

2489
02:24:07,121 --> 02:24:07,830
that he's a freak.

2490
02:24:07,830 --> 02:24:12,830
I agree that your freak
flag fly fricking freak go.

2491
02:24:13,680 --> 02:24:17,340
So he's tied to the system and all that.
And of course more all that's true.

2492
02:24:17,410 --> 02:24:20,310
Nike's still fucks with the money.
A lot of people do.

2493
02:24:20,400 --> 02:24:24,470
No really good companies even after
this. Yeah. Do you remember how big,

2494
02:24:24,520 --> 02:24:29,080
do you remember how Big Tiger
Woods was gone? Thai? Yeah. Again,

2495
02:24:29,081 --> 02:24:33,000
made golf like cool. Yeah. That's the
guy I saw my house out in that bitch.

2496
02:24:33,590 --> 02:24:37,830
Oh my God. He had Vikatin.
Yeah, and dilaudid. Jesus
Christ. He was taking some shit.

2497
02:24:37,831 --> 02:24:41,910
They gave people that were dying of
like bullet wounds in the old west days.

2498
02:24:42,900 --> 02:24:46,560
Miladin and Xanax. Christ.
You know what? Hey Man.

2499
02:24:47,510 --> 02:24:52,470
Andy say a sleep, drugs. Xanax.
Xanax is not asleep truck.
So it's a relaxer, right?

2500
02:24:52,500 --> 02:24:56,190
Like anything. Anti Insomnia, drug
ambien. Why did they say sleep drugs?

2501
02:24:56,191 --> 02:24:58,880
Zanuck no sleep track is ambien.
You dummies.

2502
02:24:59,070 --> 02:25:03,690
You Xanax is an antianxiety.
Either way. It's proof.

2503
02:25:03,691 --> 02:25:07,020
He likes to party. Yeah, man, that's
a lot of shit. Go back to that place,

2504
02:25:07,590 --> 02:25:10,950
but he doesn't really play golf anymore
yet. He does, but he's not doing good.

2505
02:25:11,040 --> 02:25:13,560
He was found unconscious
in his Mercedes Benz,

2506
02:25:13,561 --> 02:25:17,340
which was parked awkwardly on the
side of the road and had damage to the

2507
02:25:17,341 --> 02:25:21,030
driver's side. What are you
doing? He hit a bunch of shit.

2508
02:25:21,060 --> 02:25:23,890
Did you hear how he fucked up his back
and knee? Have you heard this story?

2509
02:25:24,190 --> 02:25:27,820
No. He was upset because his father was
the military. He's obsessed with military.

2510
02:25:28,030 --> 02:25:32,200
He actually trained with Navy seals,
like put on the full thing.

2511
02:25:32,350 --> 02:25:33,610
Went through this navy seal train,

2512
02:25:33,611 --> 02:25:37,030
like obviously not real shit but doing
all the marches and shit and fuck this

2513
02:25:37,031 --> 02:25:39,520
stuff up. That's how I
fucked himself up. No,

2514
02:25:39,580 --> 02:25:44,200
it's one of the ways he fucked his
knee and backup was like intense,

2515
02:25:44,350 --> 02:25:48,730
like navy seal training, like shooting
with them and stuff. That's so stupid.

2516
02:25:48,731 --> 02:25:50,830
The secret history of Tiger Woods,
is that what it's in there?

2517
02:25:53,080 --> 02:25:53,970
Fire article.

2518
02:25:54,280 --> 02:25:58,240
The death of his father set are a battle
raging inside of the world's greatest

2519
02:25:58,241 --> 02:26:01,570
golfer. How he wage that war through
an obsession with the navy seals.

2520
02:26:02,390 --> 02:26:06,320
It's tell the tale of how tiger lost his
wet. I haven't read this either. Wow.

2521
02:26:07,230 --> 02:26:08,920
Yeah, man. There's a thing.

2522
02:26:09,070 --> 02:26:14,050
I agree that you have to have mental
toughness to work out hard and to get

2523
02:26:14,051 --> 02:26:16,360
through brutal workouts.
You have to, you have to,

2524
02:26:16,361 --> 02:26:18,940
don't gotta go navy seal on a bitch
though. That's what I'm saying.

2525
02:26:19,120 --> 02:26:23,350
I'm saying you got to build your body up
to that and you are a different person.

2526
02:26:23,351 --> 02:26:25,740
You're a fucking professional athlete.
You're not a warrior.

2527
02:26:25,750 --> 02:26:29,740
Going over to cs to take bullets,
fight for your life and kill bad guys.

2528
02:26:29,800 --> 02:26:34,800
What you're doing is a very specialized
thing that it's worth a fucking billion

2529
02:26:34,840 --> 02:26:37,450
dollars. And you're also hitting
that little tiny ball on this calm,

2530
02:26:37,451 --> 02:26:38,440
quite golf course.

2531
02:26:38,560 --> 02:26:41,740
I don't need you to be in the waves
trying to learn how not to drown and fight

2532
02:26:41,741 --> 02:26:42,280
sharks.

2533
02:26:42,280 --> 02:26:46,570
It's like taking a dude who bought a brand
new Ferrari and taking them on one of

2534
02:26:46,571 --> 02:26:50,470
those crazy dirt courses that they have
those a off road Porsche's drive on.

2535
02:26:51,030 --> 02:26:53,890
You know those, uh, you've seen
those things. Those guys are like,

2536
02:26:53,891 --> 02:26:55,330
they have one guy next to him.
I never,

2537
02:26:55,331 --> 02:26:57,280
I need to ask someone what
the fuck they're doing.

2538
02:26:57,420 --> 02:26:59,590
I just have like Chris Harris on.
I'll ask him.

2539
02:26:59,750 --> 02:27:01,270
There was another guy with a notepad.

2540
02:27:01,480 --> 02:27:05,860
He'll rally cars the map and he's
going to clicks left turned right.

2541
02:27:06,260 --> 02:27:09,880
He's as navigator. Yeah, exactly. He
knows the whole course like dead on.

2542
02:27:09,940 --> 02:27:11,830
Who's reading it off a book?
Yeah.

2543
02:27:11,840 --> 02:27:16,180
Or just use mapquest says
those guys are maniacs.

2544
02:27:16,420 --> 02:27:21,420
Pull up some video of a rally drivers
or get rid of the fucking dead weight,

2545
02:27:21,821 --> 02:27:24,880
telling you the directions. Use
mapquest with the boys. You can't,

2546
02:27:25,030 --> 02:27:27,640
but they could step up their APP.
Gaming. Do something. You have to have.

2547
02:27:27,641 --> 02:27:29,860
That guy needs a job.
He's job studies.

2548
02:27:29,861 --> 02:27:33,380
The Colin's taking care of the
guy with the fucking notepad, but,

2549
02:27:33,410 --> 02:27:36,340
and he knows like how long it
takes for you to get there too.

2550
02:27:36,520 --> 02:27:38,180
Because if you're driving it,
you're fastest.

2551
02:27:38,200 --> 02:27:40,870
Even if you're off our five
or six seconds, you're in.

2552
02:27:40,871 --> 02:27:44,140
The neighborhood knows what's
up. Those guys are wild, man.

2553
02:27:44,440 --> 02:27:48,490
Those cars are so it's like
such a different style of
driving because the dirt

2554
02:27:48,610 --> 02:27:51,460
makes the,
the tires break loose like constantly.

2555
02:27:52,150 --> 02:27:54,700
Have you ever considered going
that the Porsche track here?

2556
02:27:54,701 --> 02:27:57,040
We can take all the cards
though. Let's do it. I know.

2557
02:27:57,041 --> 02:28:00,400
Don't they have a new one near the lax?
They have a new one not far from here,

2558
02:28:00,401 --> 02:28:03,310
but the guy was telling me that like
great restaurants. He's like just book.

2559
02:28:03,311 --> 02:28:07,770
It will take care of the car.
They take care of the Thai.

2560
02:28:07,970 --> 02:28:12,700
No notes go cars flat out scrooge.
Mcduck sample edibles.

2561
02:28:12,701 --> 02:28:15,820
Give that gt three Rs while it's fried.

2562
02:28:16,280 --> 02:28:19,540
Some go need some copilots.
Let me do my thing. I come on.

2563
02:28:19,720 --> 02:28:21,890
Don't go full circle all season on us.

2564
02:28:23,590 --> 02:28:26,940
Yeah, we can. This guy 61 now.

2565
02:28:30,470 --> 02:28:34,940
Holy Shit. They must be fast friends.
Jesus dust flying. They're best friends.

2566
02:28:34,970 --> 02:28:39,770
You'd have to be best
friends. Hey Bro. Wow.

2567
02:28:43,220 --> 02:28:45,470
This is nuts man.
See that red light?

2568
02:28:46,610 --> 02:28:50,960
Yeah. That is a, a sequential
manual. It's a manual,

2569
02:28:50,961 --> 02:28:55,040
but you, you just push up to
go up and down to go down.

2570
02:28:55,041 --> 02:28:59,360
You don't have to find out here. Good
speed, right. The quickness. Yeah.

2571
02:28:59,960 --> 02:29:01,270
Yeah.
You don't have to find

2572
02:29:01,380 --> 02:29:03,700
the perfect year,
you know,

2573
02:29:03,880 --> 02:29:05,530
give,
you're using that h pattern.

2574
02:29:05,710 --> 02:29:08,230
You're going up and then you go on
down and you go up to the right. Yeah.

2575
02:29:08,231 --> 02:29:12,590
So it's down three down, two
up one. You know, the, the,

2576
02:29:12,591 --> 02:29:14,560
the way you're doing it is,
it's very different.

2577
02:29:14,590 --> 02:29:18,860
Although my new Porsche Pete
Pdk will shit on this. Yeah.

2578
02:29:19,760 --> 02:29:21,040
Yeah.
It'll shit on it.

2579
02:29:21,130 --> 02:29:26,130
But this is probably more fun for this
not sitting in traffic on that road.

2580
02:29:26,291 --> 02:29:30,310
I assume that dead he traffic.
Yeah. I go down the canyon.

2581
02:29:30,311 --> 02:29:33,760
I just opened that bitch. I
have take some risks too. Yeah.

2582
02:29:33,761 --> 02:29:37,750
But it's not as fun as driving a manual
to me. If I, if it was like the one,

2583
02:29:37,780 --> 02:29:40,300
if I was driving in traffic all the time,
I would,

2584
02:29:40,360 --> 02:29:42,610
there's not a chance in the world.
I would want a manual.

2585
02:29:43,150 --> 02:29:48,100
You don't drive your gt three and the
four oh five sometimes not five in the

2586
02:29:48,101 --> 02:29:53,020
afternoon. Sure. I do. Really?
Yeah. Even like, Yup. Oh Wow. Yeah.

2587
02:29:53,200 --> 02:29:55,150
Well you just like,
sometimes it's like driving that thing.

2588
02:29:55,151 --> 02:29:58,930
I just want to drive me to like sometimes
I'll take the long way home or at

2589
02:29:58,931 --> 02:30:03,931
night I'll just jump on the Pacific
coast highway 2018 BMW m five pack 600

2590
02:30:04,841 --> 02:30:08,260
horsepower and m x drive
all wheel drive system.

2591
02:30:08,261 --> 02:30:10,900
Woo 60 and 3.2 whoa.

2592
02:30:10,930 --> 02:30:13,450
That's a big car to pay for the extra day.

2593
02:30:13,540 --> 02:30:17,350
That doesn't top out at like 140 it'll
it tops out at one 11 unless you pay for

2594
02:30:17,351 --> 02:30:21,570
the package.
BMW needs step their game up though.

2595
02:30:21,690 --> 02:30:24,220
I feel like they're losing the
battle with everyone else right now.

2596
02:30:24,400 --> 02:30:29,260
Well they say Sadie's is just [inaudible].
It's definitely ahead of them.

2597
02:30:29,410 --> 02:30:32,050
You know what BMW has coming out though?
An eight series.

2598
02:30:32,260 --> 02:30:34,900
The eight series a sedan.
Divina back.

2599
02:30:35,490 --> 02:30:39,200
Do you remember you she removed the eight
50 yeah, the front end. They were all,

2600
02:30:39,201 --> 02:30:40,270
she wants to have one of those.

2601
02:30:40,290 --> 02:30:44,780
Katie who's got a them to the comic store
back in those days are a nightmare now.

2602
02:30:44,920 --> 02:30:49,180
But yeah, look at this new one though. Oh
Shit. Go full screen sun. Look at this.

2603
02:30:49,210 --> 02:30:51,670
What? You're only seeing the front
of it. Wait till they go on the side.

2604
02:30:52,120 --> 02:30:55,720
Look what this thing looks
like. It's wicked bad. Damn.

2605
02:30:55,740 --> 02:30:59,040
That's like an I eight but not
the electric version. No, no, no.

2606
02:30:59,041 --> 02:31:02,560
It doesn't look that space. Shippy
no, no, no. You know what it's like,

2607
02:31:02,561 --> 02:31:06,100
it's like the BMW or the Mercedes
s class coupe. Yeah, those are,

2608
02:31:06,280 --> 02:31:08,890
that's what it's like and it's
this, the big body. Um, uh,

2609
02:31:08,950 --> 02:31:12,670
I'm assuming a twin turbo. I don't know
what the fuck that's got under the hood.

2610
02:31:12,671 --> 02:31:15,940
I think all their cars are turbo
like date 50 back in the day.

2611
02:31:15,941 --> 02:31:19,620
Look at the back end though.
Damn. Nothing is bad them here.

2612
02:31:19,621 --> 02:31:24,290
They'll spin around that. I
ate pissed. That's a tron car.

2613
02:31:24,291 --> 02:31:26,610
I test drove that. They're like,
get the fuck out of my face man.

2614
02:31:26,850 --> 02:31:31,170
Too many different colors too. And you
know what? It's going to skinny tires.

2615
02:31:31,830 --> 02:31:36,420
Yes. Can't fuck it. I need fat tires. I
don't even like the tires on the corvette.

2616
02:31:36,421 --> 02:31:39,900
How about that? I need some fat
ass tires even though the will,

2617
02:31:39,901 --> 02:31:42,900
the drug room dynamic. Shut your
hole. I liked the way it looks.

2618
02:31:43,410 --> 02:31:48,410
I like fat acids and fat tires and Tig
old biddies fix 10 nothing is dope.

2619
02:31:50,410 --> 02:31:54,310
Pretty sick. You used to have the m six
right? Yeah, them six I think it was fun,

2620
02:31:54,320 --> 02:31:54,750
right?

2621
02:31:54,750 --> 02:31:59,750
Nothing was a monster heavy straight
up v 10 heavy smoothed down highway.

2622
02:32:00,010 --> 02:32:04,470
Right? Yeah. Nothing fun in the tribe.
Now that Porsche gts is, you know,

2623
02:32:04,471 --> 02:32:05,940
they say that's the best of the Porsche's.

2624
02:32:06,120 --> 02:32:09,900
There was a article that I just read
in one of the car magazines that said,

2625
02:32:09,901 --> 02:32:14,400
uh yeah, see if you can find rag
to my friends. Go to a Porsche.

2626
02:32:14,401 --> 02:32:16,200
GTS is the best Porsche.

2627
02:32:16,230 --> 02:32:20,160
It's like a very recent article that I
actually read this morning on Google type

2628
02:32:20,161 --> 02:32:23,400
move. Yeah, they were saying that
it's the best version of it. You know,

2629
02:32:23,401 --> 02:32:25,890
you've got your gt three
which is like super hardcore.

2630
02:32:25,920 --> 02:32:27,510
I test drove that room and I called you.

2631
02:32:27,510 --> 02:32:30,420
I was test driving the gt three and I'm
like, Joe, you love this thing. You said,

2632
02:32:30,421 --> 02:32:33,810
unless you got another vehicle,
man for you drive every day is a bad idea.

2633
02:32:33,870 --> 02:32:37,890
You'll get loud and get it to pull.
The GTS is low too.

2634
02:32:37,891 --> 02:32:40,800
I escaped the Front for Felony
Crime. So another interest. So,

2635
02:32:40,840 --> 02:32:45,540
but the gt three has a button that raises
yeah, yes. Front end. The GTS does it.

2636
02:32:45,570 --> 02:32:49,110
Well it's not the GT three.
It does because you buy it that way.

2637
02:32:49,140 --> 02:32:53,640
[inaudible] options that will option
wasn't there. But tech art makes um, a a,

2638
02:32:53,650 --> 02:32:57,360
an aftermarket one so you can get that
and get it installed and it'll raise it

2639
02:32:57,361 --> 02:33:00,410
up. I know a bunch of Porsche
dealerships that do it. Yeah.

2640
02:33:01,630 --> 02:33:04,650
My gts, yes. My gt three
has an aftermarket.

2641
02:33:04,740 --> 02:33:08,460
Oh my gt three saved the day I have to
park on the street cause my driveway's

2642
02:33:08,490 --> 02:33:11,640
like this. Yeah. I had
to take one of my, um,

2643
02:33:11,790 --> 02:33:15,840
one of my other buttons from something
else and have a dedicated to that,

2644
02:33:15,841 --> 02:33:17,580
a gt three button.
I matter of fact,

2645
02:33:17,581 --> 02:33:20,610
I think they took it from a blank
and they installed a button in it.

2646
02:33:21,120 --> 02:33:22,720
You have a blank where you can put it.

2647
02:33:25,000 --> 02:33:29,640
Mine's right on my, uh, my
rear view mirror. Rather when
I go, uh, near something,

2648
02:33:29,641 --> 02:33:31,950
I'll hit that button.
It was the best car on earth.

2649
02:33:31,951 --> 02:33:35,220
What did you say was a Porsche gts?

2650
02:33:35,430 --> 02:33:39,870
2018 Porsche gts is the best. Uh, nine 11,

2651
02:33:40,260 --> 02:33:42,120
they were saying they
were just going over like,

2652
02:33:42,150 --> 02:33:45,150
it's like hardcore but not too ridiculous.

2653
02:33:45,151 --> 02:33:49,350
I got a gt three Rs and that it's
pretty slick. Do you see that one guy?

2654
02:33:49,710 --> 02:33:53,340
He spent a shitload of money
to take you as the Porsche.

2655
02:33:53,341 --> 02:33:58,110
That brand new gt three Rs is only um,
PDK.

2656
02:33:58,260 --> 02:33:59,640
They don't make it in a manual.

2657
02:33:59,850 --> 02:34:04,170
Says guy spent a shitload of money to
have a six speed from a Porsche nine 11

2658
02:34:04,171 --> 02:34:09,030
are installed in a gt three rs cost
so much. He must just be scrooge.

2659
02:34:09,240 --> 02:34:10,970
[inaudible] screwed,
screwed up all the Porsche.

2660
02:34:11,160 --> 02:34:13,620
But if you even have one of
those things, that's it. Pull up,

2661
02:34:13,621 --> 02:34:17,190
pull up the top of the article.
What does it say? Quick take,

2662
02:34:17,260 --> 02:34:22,150
not the fastest nine 11, but possibly
the best. When is it from August.

2663
02:34:22,180 --> 02:34:25,570
Yeah. The things that today's
fun. Yeah, that's it. Yeah.

2664
02:34:26,200 --> 02:34:27,760
Well it's not the fastest though.

2665
02:34:27,761 --> 02:34:32,730
The nine 11 turbo turbo so that things
are God damn space machine like that.

2666
02:34:32,840 --> 02:34:37,690
This time. Have you test drove one
yet? 2007 or 2000 I'm not seven.

2667
02:34:37,740 --> 02:34:41,170
Uh,
2009 or 10 I drove one.

2668
02:34:41,230 --> 02:34:45,190
The new ones that I test drove
faster, the gt three and that, yeah,

2669
02:34:45,191 --> 02:34:47,290
I was just in love with my car so fast.

2670
02:34:47,350 --> 02:34:51,940
There's stupid fat and they're four
wheel drive, but the new ones even fast,

2671
02:34:51,970 --> 02:34:53,380
way faster than that one.

2672
02:34:53,650 --> 02:34:58,390
The one that I drove her insanely insane.
The GT three.

2673
02:34:58,391 --> 02:35:03,280
It's just you. I felt like it was like
hard, but yeah, so hardcore that you,

2674
02:35:03,281 --> 02:35:06,490
you would love the turbo if you got one
of those new turbines, you'd be like,

2675
02:35:06,491 --> 02:35:10,890
what in the five test drove that
and the gts gts module with that. I,

2676
02:35:11,160 --> 02:35:14,890
there's my, cause my car, it's like that
lava orange, it has the duck wing on it.

2677
02:35:14,891 --> 02:35:18,140
It's just like a vintage
Porsche to me like that. Right.

2678
02:35:18,160 --> 02:35:19,720
I saw on the show them right
away. I'm like, that's it.

2679
02:35:19,721 --> 02:35:21,970
I'll look at these own that. The
judge. No, I'm like that's it.

2680
02:35:22,240 --> 02:35:26,150
I test drove g three everything and I,
I just let him know doc wing the duck.

2681
02:35:27,090 --> 02:35:30,370
Cause when I was a kid I always had saw
a poster for a Porsche and had the old

2682
02:35:30,371 --> 02:35:33,370
school doctors green and I forget
how to duck wing on it. I'm like,

2683
02:35:33,371 --> 02:35:37,480
that has a duck way. Yeah. That's
like, and that's important. 73 Rs.

2684
02:35:37,640 --> 02:35:42,580
It's so cool man. You know those cars was
1973 RS is a worth over $1 million now.

2685
02:35:43,060 --> 02:35:47,170
So sick. Like why if you bought it
back in the day was like 20 grand.

2686
02:35:47,470 --> 02:35:49,960
Now it's worth $1 million.
Why don't you do you,

2687
02:35:49,961 --> 02:35:53,680
aren't you doing some with a Porsche
school porch? Not that old school.

2688
02:35:53,750 --> 02:35:58,750
So 1988 [inaudible] 86 or something.

2689
02:35:59,861 --> 02:36:04,360
Shark words. Just turn the
thing into bay. It's a um, uh,

2690
02:36:04,361 --> 02:36:09,280
an rs America and nine, six, four, just
like one of the last, the air cooled cars,

2691
02:36:09,281 --> 02:36:12,310
the last, the air cooled was the nine,
nine three, which is like a little bigger.

2692
02:36:12,590 --> 02:36:17,170
This is a nine, six, four. The air cooled,
everyone's obsessed with isn't shown.

2693
02:36:17,840 --> 02:36:21,050
It's just a different animal. And you
get them pretty cheap too. You know,

2694
02:36:21,070 --> 02:36:22,090
they're just not,
it's not.

2695
02:36:22,091 --> 02:36:25,240
It's different kind of car and if you go
earlier than that, you get me cheaper.

2696
02:36:25,660 --> 02:36:29,330
You can get them pretty cheap for
like the 1980s cars. I seen him.

2697
02:36:29,440 --> 02:36:33,510
I seen that one that I found.
It was a 78 Kirra and island,

2698
02:36:33,520 --> 02:36:37,150
but it had some reconstructive
like stuff to it look fun.

2699
02:36:37,210 --> 02:36:39,160
It's a bad investment because
it's like, oh, I saw that car.

2700
02:36:39,161 --> 02:36:42,970
You send me a picture of it. I want
that. Yeah, those are ass crazy man.

2701
02:36:42,971 --> 02:36:44,380
Those things through dangerous.

2702
02:36:44,440 --> 02:36:47,440
Do you know about how to
drive house like you when you,

2703
02:36:47,500 --> 02:36:49,960
when you take taking turns you
have to keep your foot on the gas.

2704
02:36:50,000 --> 02:36:51,010
I know there's no,

2705
02:36:51,070 --> 02:36:55,320
if you let off the gas they have throttle
overstay like what does it call the

2706
02:36:55,360 --> 02:36:58,780
throttle led off oversteer or something.
I'm trying to,

2707
02:36:58,781 --> 02:37:03,110
I'm trying to go out like
James Dean. That's exactly
what it was. Silver too. Well,

2708
02:37:03,111 --> 02:37:06,790
they're really light. Yeah, I know.
They looked fun. They feel different.

2709
02:37:06,820 --> 02:37:10,960
Like my friend Alex from shark
works has a nine six, four and his,

2710
02:37:11,110 --> 02:37:14,210
it feels different because
they're so small. It's like it's,

2711
02:37:14,290 --> 02:37:16,820
it's you're more connected
to what you're doing.

2712
02:37:17,000 --> 02:37:20,450
It's really light and really small,
which is cool. Yeah. Swishy this day,

2713
02:37:20,510 --> 02:37:22,730
like going down to paying a cane.
I'm not using it every day.

2714
02:37:22,731 --> 02:37:27,680
Cars think it'd be fun and I want
a new bronco as a daily driver.

2715
02:37:27,710 --> 02:37:32,190
The new, new, new new one. You seen
that thing? Why? What's up? Oh,

2716
02:37:32,370 --> 02:37:35,900
and juice and I live over by their,
what's up?

2717
02:37:36,590 --> 02:37:39,500
Who was going to buy the juices? Car.
They got to put that up for sale,

2718
02:37:39,501 --> 02:37:43,070
but an auction company just passed
on it and they go on for 350,000

2719
02:37:44,990 --> 02:37:47,870
the actual like rides three 50
why and all this? I have no idea.

2720
02:37:47,871 --> 02:37:50,650
You'd have to be a ghoul.
You'd have to be a real long task.

2721
02:37:51,050 --> 02:37:55,340
Can you imagine if I drove it? What is
it, dude? This is the car. No, Jay cut.

2722
02:37:55,520 --> 02:37:58,040
You're an asshole. We can't
be friends anymore. Yeah.

2723
02:37:58,880 --> 02:38:01,940
Oj Simpson's White Bronco Escape car.
Wow.

2724
02:38:02,070 --> 02:38:07,070
It goes on sale for $700,000 as a former
agent decides it's time to cash and

2725
02:38:08,300 --> 02:38:11,510
decides it's time to cash in.
Right when Oj is getting out of jail,

2726
02:38:11,560 --> 02:38:15,530
I was just going to kidnap this dude
and go back to jail cause this guy sells

2727
02:38:15,531 --> 02:38:19,310
his Bronco for 700 grand. That's his
fucking whip, man. He's going to stab you.

2728
02:38:19,311 --> 02:38:23,780
It looks pretty good shape. I
like the wheels. Right? Right.

2729
02:38:24,200 --> 02:38:26,710
Should we get it as like a company car?
Some shit.

2730
02:38:27,200 --> 02:38:32,060
$700,000 that is the cost
saying what year was it?

2731
02:38:32,970 --> 02:38:37,850
[inaudible] 93 right? No, it can't
be new. It wasn't new at the time.

2732
02:38:37,851 --> 02:38:42,130
I don't think God [inaudible]
94 police chase. What years?

2733
02:38:42,160 --> 02:38:47,060
The coffee like the car's 93 does it
say 89 Bronco? Does that sound right?

2734
02:38:47,450 --> 02:38:52,340
Yeah, it sounds right in the nineties
Bronco. My pops hasn't been since Bronco.

2735
02:38:52,341 --> 02:38:54,710
They're smaller.
Huh?

2736
02:38:54,770 --> 02:38:59,770
My Dad had an Eddie Bauer 92 telling you
my pops had an Eddie Bauer Bronco and

2737
02:39:01,030 --> 02:39:04,810
the thing was tiny. I remember the
Eddie Bauer ones was like, Whoa,

2738
02:39:05,000 --> 02:39:09,020
what is this weird like what do you fly
fishing and why is this Eddie Bauer?

2739
02:39:09,060 --> 02:39:11,540
Yeah, it had this cool trim
on it. My Dad would say,

2740
02:39:11,570 --> 02:39:15,530
Eddie Bauer like was a big deal.
God Damn,

2741
02:39:15,560 --> 02:39:18,530
it's up for sale on pawn stars now.
That'd be on pumps.

2742
02:39:19,700 --> 02:39:21,500
Probably made some extra cash.
I've already seen it.

2743
02:39:21,530 --> 02:39:25,160
The pawn star guy turned it down. He
did? Yeah. He didn't want it could move.

2744
02:39:25,640 --> 02:39:27,950
He said, I don't want that bad
Juju. Am I below that song? Well,

2745
02:39:27,951 --> 02:39:32,290
there was blood in that car,
man. Was it? Oh judge. Yeah.

2746
02:39:33,030 --> 02:39:37,370
Yeah. He cut his own hand with
the knife, allegedly. So sketchy.

2747
02:39:37,400 --> 02:39:40,460
Did you see him get a released?
Like when they only gave him parole?

2748
02:39:40,461 --> 02:39:43,040
Did you wash that was crunk
and will just judge you did.

2749
02:39:43,041 --> 02:39:45,350
It was like a huge football fan.
Do you know that?

2750
02:39:45,770 --> 02:39:49,820
But this is saying it's amazing shape.
I drove it around and found a little odd,

2751
02:39:50,240 --> 02:39:52,520
but it runs great.
You found a little odd.

2752
02:39:52,610 --> 02:39:57,500
Did it smell like murder if it
smelled like dead bitches? God,

2753
02:39:57,501 --> 02:40:02,450
Bro. I watched it live. I was in
Italy. I wasn't gonna miss it.

2754
02:40:02,451 --> 02:40:05,510
I was like, I need to see
this. Oh, getting out. You
don't have him on the podcast.

2755
02:40:06,320 --> 02:40:09,860
I joked around about it. I put it
on the podcast. I put it on Twitter.

2756
02:40:09,890 --> 02:40:12,680
Should I have him on
the podcast or na or na?

2757
02:40:12,910 --> 02:40:17,250
And Moshe Kasher was the first one to
respond. But she say Moshe, the comics,

2758
02:40:17,251 --> 02:40:21,030
they end up, it's a he. Oh, my
bat Natasha is that the watch?

2759
02:40:22,470 --> 02:40:26,820
But Natasha Moshe, that's tough.
Yeah, I get ya. Yeah. Yeah. Um,

2760
02:40:27,510 --> 02:40:30,570
I think he was like, oh good Lord.
Something, something along those lines.

2761
02:40:31,890 --> 02:40:36,480
I feel like it'd be so interesting. Well,
don't get me wrong, he completed burger,

2762
02:40:36,510 --> 02:40:39,450
but I feel like it'd be so answering
if you went down that route.

2763
02:40:39,450 --> 02:40:42,840
Like what have you been up to football
days, how the fuck did we get here?

2764
02:40:43,030 --> 02:40:47,400
He'll say, this isn't even a way how I do
it. Your warm up. Roll them up. Hey Val,

2765
02:40:47,460 --> 02:40:50,700
tell us how great you were at
football show you. Do you? Oh yeah,

2766
02:40:50,701 --> 02:40:53,460
maybe I can get them on the fire and the
kid. I don't know if that's platform.

2767
02:40:53,700 --> 02:40:55,920
Callan would be the
perfect gas to talk to him.

2768
02:40:56,100 --> 02:40:58,530
Calla definitely not interrupted him
and start talking about stories and he

2769
02:40:58,531 --> 02:41:03,170
played football or tell him
about the Thai. Perfect. Yeah,

2770
02:41:03,660 --> 02:41:06,540
it'd be actually counting him
together would be really interesting.

2771
02:41:07,330 --> 02:41:09,720
I thought I would. I would. I would
like to actually see that town.

2772
02:41:09,750 --> 02:41:14,530
Make him feel good to compliment them.
You know like [inaudible] one [inaudible]

2773
02:41:16,170 --> 02:41:18,450
don't say what you would
do. Never know man. I,

2774
02:41:18,520 --> 02:41:21,750
he might go on a podcast like
marketing thing. Look Bro,

2775
02:41:21,840 --> 02:41:24,810
my race definitely we're writing a
book. Is he get mad? Is it poor taste?

2776
02:41:24,811 --> 02:41:27,920
If I drive around Brentwood
and a brand new white, yeah.

2777
02:41:28,170 --> 02:41:32,820
No really for Halloween for sure. If
you like paint my face black. Yeah.

2778
02:41:32,821 --> 02:41:36,870
If you have like a Piko black face and
by catch a seat seatbelt clanging around

2779
02:41:36,871 --> 02:41:40,910
on the right girl wears a blonde
wig in the bag. That's poor taste.

2780
02:41:40,940 --> 02:41:41,970
See I'm not going that far.

2781
02:41:42,030 --> 02:41:44,550
I just want a dope ass brand
new Ford Bronco and white.

2782
02:41:44,610 --> 02:41:48,990
The new ones are pretty sick if they do
a good job with it. Have you seen him?

2783
02:41:49,290 --> 02:41:52,250
I've seen some. Um, what do they
call those things? Prototypes.

2784
02:41:53,370 --> 02:41:56,430
What do they call them? They don't
call it prototype. What's that word?

2785
02:41:58,770 --> 02:42:03,750
What does the word they use? Concept.
What? They look like the raptor. Well,

2786
02:42:03,751 --> 02:42:08,130
that's smart. Move the raptors.
Pretty Dope. So sick. Look at it. Ooh,

2787
02:42:08,160 --> 02:42:13,050
slick. See you. Imagine me that
like, I do like that. Right?

2788
02:42:13,410 --> 02:42:17,160
Who are they doing? A
four doors. Oh, okay.

2789
02:42:17,970 --> 02:42:20,010
What's going on in 2018 though?
Early two 18.

2790
02:42:20,011 --> 02:42:23,880
See that Cadillac right here was a god
damn bad ass car to Americans making some

2791
02:42:23,881 --> 02:42:25,800
kick ass cars. Now see that
Cadillac, right? They're

2792
02:42:28,650 --> 02:42:30,390
not though.
They're cool.

2793
02:42:30,391 --> 02:42:33,320
And Tigo from a Porsche or a Bentley
and the jump metallic. You'll all right.

2794
02:42:33,360 --> 02:42:37,920
Kind of basic. Yeah. Interiors or
basic. You're spoiled. Spoiled. I know.

2795
02:42:38,190 --> 02:42:42,150
The German was a little baby thing.
Gotcha. They got me. It's true. Right?

2796
02:42:42,151 --> 02:42:45,390
There's no American equivalent
to like a Mercedes s class.

2797
02:42:45,420 --> 02:42:50,010
They just don't quite get there. We just
went out there and it's not weird. Like,

2798
02:42:50,011 --> 02:42:53,580
why don't they get, they're like, why
doesn't someone just dig in and go,

2799
02:42:53,581 --> 02:42:57,120
let's just throw our fucking
Dick into this hat through.

2800
02:42:57,121 --> 02:43:00,930
Let's just get our dicks and then
the third here. Fucking yeah,

2801
02:43:00,931 --> 02:43:05,340
just build some beast of a fucking like
what's the best America Lincoln like

2802
02:43:05,341 --> 02:43:10,100
you'd get a Lincoln. No, because no one
cares. No one cares for the older crowd.

2803
02:43:10,170 --> 02:43:11,640
Yeah.
You show up at a Lincoln navigator.

2804
02:43:11,790 --> 02:43:16,630
Fuck shorty from 94 not a bad car.
The new ones are actually pretty nice.

2805
02:43:16,631 --> 02:43:20,380
I know, but the point is it's
not a Mercedes just cut. What?

2806
02:43:20,381 --> 02:43:23,620
American car can you pull up and
shit on people now it's comfy.

2807
02:43:23,800 --> 02:43:26,440
Nothing Eldorado now that
they don't have a viper,

2808
02:43:26,470 --> 02:43:29,740
you can't even pull up in a
sports car now. Old Demon.

2809
02:43:30,550 --> 02:43:34,470
I typed in American muscle
car and it's just muscle less.

2810
02:43:34,600 --> 02:43:36,910
You still kick ass. I'm
talking luxury car. Well,

2811
02:43:36,911 --> 02:43:39,640
they have the market cornered
when it comes to muscle cars.

2812
02:43:39,641 --> 02:43:43,140
When it comes to a stupid car with a
giant engine that makes a ton of noise,

2813
02:43:43,170 --> 02:43:47,230
we're killing it and it uses a
manual transmission marriage all day.

2814
02:43:47,470 --> 02:43:50,740
They still make the corvette.
Z O six in the fucking manual.

2815
02:43:50,770 --> 02:43:54,960
It's one of the few cars that Germans
are the only ones in the Porsche.

2816
02:43:55,100 --> 02:43:59,710
A Porsche is the only ones that have had
the balls to come bring a manual back

2817
02:43:59,770 --> 02:44:02,860
after they took it away.
Ferrari still hasn't figured it out yet.

2818
02:44:02,920 --> 02:44:06,220
They refuse to tell. Well, because
Douche bags it buy Ferrari's.

2819
02:44:06,221 --> 02:44:09,530
They're all just trying to floss. Trust
of them. Don't even know how to drive one.

2820
02:44:09,531 --> 02:44:13,090
Not Real. It's not. It's not a track car.
Have you seen that Porsche Turbo can buy?

2821
02:44:13,091 --> 02:44:14,290
It's like the platinum edition.

2822
02:44:14,320 --> 02:44:18,490
The wheels are made out of carbon
fiber and the whole it's gold. It's a,

2823
02:44:18,500 --> 02:44:22,480
it's like a dark,
like not like scrooge McDuck gold coin,

2824
02:44:22,630 --> 02:44:25,510
but it's like a gold color.
Bring that shit up dude.

2825
02:44:27,500 --> 02:44:32,080
It's this, it's this special
Porsche turbo like platinum edition,

2826
02:44:32,230 --> 02:44:34,630
platinum edition turbo,
but it's in gold.

2827
02:44:34,631 --> 02:44:38,530
How I wrote a goal and then it has
black rims that are carbon fiber. Dude.

2828
02:44:38,710 --> 02:44:41,770
Why is it platinum edition? But it's
in gold. Shouldn't it be in platinum?

2829
02:44:41,771 --> 02:44:45,400
It should be platinum. I Dunno. I
think he's scared this issue. It like,

2830
02:44:45,401 --> 02:44:47,380
remember when Justin Bieber had that?

2831
02:44:47,590 --> 02:44:50,620
That chrome Fisker Fisker fan.

2832
02:44:50,650 --> 02:44:54,160
I saw one the other death taught
brides split dope. It's dope.

2833
02:44:54,161 --> 02:44:58,780
Look in the catch on fire and there it is.
It's about my bat exclusive series.

2834
02:44:58,810 --> 02:45:02,860
Look at that thing.
Joe, buy this, buy this.

2835
02:45:03,820 --> 02:45:07,720
That's your niche, right? Look at that
thing. They're tough to get to. Are they?

2836
02:45:07,960 --> 02:45:11,710
Yeah, when I want it. Well cause
it was tough to get ones here.

2837
02:45:11,720 --> 02:45:15,430
Like still figure it out.
No, we'll figure it out.

2838
02:45:15,431 --> 02:45:17,920
I'm not driving a gold car
bro, Bro. That's not gold.

2839
02:45:20,490 --> 02:45:24,040
What color is it then? The
platinum edition. You are right.

2840
02:45:24,140 --> 02:45:28,090
The platinum edition a but it
adds another 66,000 under your,

2841
02:45:28,120 --> 02:45:31,420
it's your tag. That
exclusive series. It's fast,

2842
02:45:31,720 --> 02:45:35,530
luxurious and delightfully gold.
The beautiful special edition.

2843
02:45:35,531 --> 02:45:39,460
We limit it to 500 units worldwide. Hey,
guess what? When you make something cool,

2844
02:45:39,580 --> 02:45:42,070
make a bunch of 'em you assholes.
Now I'm going to buy them.

2845
02:45:42,320 --> 02:45:46,270
Make an exclusive only to have
it. I don't want it. Whoa.

2846
02:45:46,630 --> 02:45:49,360
Look at though.
That fucking thing is nasty.

2847
02:45:49,361 --> 02:45:53,050
Looking at zero to 60 times 2.8 seconds.
That seems excessive.

2848
02:45:53,650 --> 02:45:56,410
How's it going to get shorter than that?
You're not even three seconds.

2849
02:45:56,411 --> 02:45:58,420
You're going 60 miles an
hour because with those,

2850
02:45:58,480 --> 02:46:02,290
those new rims that are all carbon
fiber scope, how sick is that?

2851
02:46:02,320 --> 02:46:06,550
Those rims are dope. I was skeptical
at first. Those rims are killer.

2852
02:46:06,940 --> 02:46:10,160
I like the black stripes too.
It's a nice car,

2853
02:46:10,670 --> 02:46:14,420
but you know what a lot of people don't
like the way nine 11 turbos look like.

2854
02:46:14,421 --> 02:46:17,480
What did my friend when you get
into that cannot be my friend?

2855
02:46:17,750 --> 02:46:21,350
It's a first look at that
fucking car, Bro. It's bad ass.

2856
02:46:22,070 --> 02:46:26,300
The stripes on the seats. Ooh, that's
what it comes with. That luggage to Jamie,

2857
02:46:27,370 --> 02:46:30,720
Bro.
I would flaunt that everywhere.

2858
02:46:32,580 --> 02:46:35,840
Got Damage,
but it's like how much does it cost?

2859
02:46:36,140 --> 02:46:40,130
66 I think 66,000 over.
Well,

2860
02:46:40,150 --> 02:46:45,150
you get to watch Justin coop
and the $257,000 but no,

2861
02:46:45,981 --> 02:46:49,300
it's more than that, right? Ooh. Ah.

2862
02:46:49,720 --> 02:46:53,090
It doesn't come with the
five piece luggage. Another
sixth grade by that pitch.

2863
02:46:53,180 --> 02:46:57,710
6,000, 324 for the luggage service. Every
penny, how much you get for the watch.

2864
02:46:59,600 --> 02:47:03,260
Dope is that thing though.
It's nice. I prefer silver,

2865
02:47:04,520 --> 02:47:08,000
especially that thing that is a spaceship.
I mean your flex on people.

2866
02:47:08,000 --> 02:47:09,570
If you pull up in a cold pour,

2867
02:47:09,590 --> 02:47:13,320
a hundred percent match matching luggage
and I'll watch pull up in a red Ferrari

2868
02:47:13,321 --> 02:47:18,010
and double-flex you. I don't, not in
that thing. I feel like I've seen fries.

2869
02:47:18,560 --> 02:47:21,740
Yeah. I was in Italy and a guy
had a Ferrari in Italy. I'm like,

2870
02:47:21,741 --> 02:47:24,860
this motherfucker has a variety in
Italy. He went, it's pretty classy.

2871
02:47:24,890 --> 02:47:29,000
It was red right in front of this
beautiful hotel on the Amalfi coast,

2872
02:47:29,001 --> 02:47:32,960
on that guy is bald. And he probably had
something to look at that Jamie. Fuck.

2873
02:47:32,961 --> 02:47:36,190
Damn. Jamie Foxx. Jamie Foxx
has a shiny gold Bugatti.

2874
02:47:36,440 --> 02:47:40,880
He wins and a gold wheels.
His wheels are fucking gold.

2875
02:47:40,881 --> 02:47:45,710
He wins. Jamie Foxx wins.
Yeah, go back to, um, the, um,

2876
02:47:46,340 --> 02:47:49,460
the, um, what is the, um, the
new Ferrari? What does that they,

2877
02:47:50,420 --> 02:47:54,700
the fuck is it called? No, I'm
not. I'm not a Lamborghini Ferrari.

2878
02:47:55,320 --> 02:47:59,180
See, for me it goes Porsche fry.
I'm not laying McKeany guy. Yeah,

2879
02:47:59,240 --> 02:48:03,160
Lamborghini gets a little sketchy,
but I gotta say con,

2880
02:48:03,280 --> 02:48:05,850
they yelled when I see a guy and I'm to
guide. You probably have a small day.

2881
02:48:05,860 --> 02:48:10,520
Yellow little, yeah, the yellow little.
Yeah. It's just like, oh well, giant tool.

2882
02:48:10,521 --> 02:48:13,550
Check me out. Yeah. It's like
if you buy a Ferrari, Ooh,

2883
02:48:13,640 --> 02:48:18,640
that's a four eight eight special edition
Sun lighter with larger appetite for

2884
02:48:19,170 --> 02:48:23,120
Apexus. That's the like the race
version, but that's a shitty picture.

2885
02:48:23,600 --> 02:48:27,560
Go to a video. Ferrari for Aa like
that has a beautiful car, man.

2886
02:48:27,590 --> 02:48:30,920
That's exactly what the guy had in Italy.
That is a big thing,

2887
02:48:32,030 --> 02:48:36,470
but I'll tell you what, what it looks
better than that. The new Ford Gt,

2888
02:48:36,740 --> 02:48:39,110
that thing sick, that looks
better than that. That it,

2889
02:48:39,111 --> 02:48:42,560
that might be the American
Ferrari. Oh, it's,

2890
02:48:42,650 --> 02:48:47,120
it's based off the front to copy the front
of that thing. Go full screen, Jamie.

2891
02:48:47,210 --> 02:48:51,320
I'll take the hips on that pitch.
That thing is,

2892
02:48:51,380 --> 02:48:56,240
Ooh, Jamie, do you get this stuff? Does
this do anything for you? Get Boring.

2893
02:49:02,120 --> 02:49:04,850
You pause too hard. Yeah. I don't
think he's velvet ropes around.

2894
02:49:04,851 --> 02:49:06,920
The stupid thing won't let
me fucking get my Paul's.

2895
02:49:07,200 --> 02:49:10,080
Is this a club with a bottle
service or Goddamn car?

2896
02:49:10,110 --> 02:49:12,470
Cause I don't see any fucking drinks
around there. Yeah. Why? Where's the,

2897
02:49:12,600 --> 02:49:17,070
where's the car? And let me get
my hands on it yet things filthy.

2898
02:49:17,100 --> 02:49:20,880
It's a beast. Their budgets.
You know what they are.

2899
02:49:21,030 --> 02:49:23,940
Here's the thing there.
God Damn Gorgeous there.

2900
02:49:23,941 --> 02:49:28,650
They slip on incredible but they're
going to probably break. Yeah.

2901
02:49:28,710 --> 02:49:31,380
You didn't have some problems with it
with a Porsche. You never have problems.

2902
02:49:31,381 --> 02:49:31,980
Really.
Yeah.

2903
02:49:31,980 --> 02:49:36,540
It's like the difference between a girl
who does crossfit and she's got like

2904
02:49:36,541 --> 02:49:41,541
thick ass and big legs and his shoulders
are a little stacked and she a address.

2905
02:49:42,510 --> 02:49:43,110
Right.

2906
02:49:43,110 --> 02:49:48,110
Versus a girl who's like a model who's
going to turn an ankle if she goes to the

2907
02:49:48,391 --> 02:49:49,224
beach

2908
02:49:53,570 --> 02:49:57,520
with that other than say the crossfade
curls going to like eventually breakdown

2909
02:49:57,580 --> 02:50:01,530
cause crossfits and shit.
Now the crossfit girl is the viper.

2910
02:50:01,950 --> 02:50:06,660
That's the viper ACI burry. That fucking
Shitty for rock. You get that new viper.

2911
02:50:06,661 --> 02:50:10,950
That thing breaks race courses everywhere.
It's tiny. It's buried in that Ferrari.

2912
02:50:11,160 --> 02:50:15,420
Fuck you as it drives by sticks
is figure out the window.

2913
02:50:15,421 --> 02:50:19,470
When a kid rock song claims,
I mean that is not even close.

2914
02:50:19,471 --> 02:50:20,700
It's going to kill the Ferrari,

2915
02:50:20,880 --> 02:50:25,140
but the Ferrari's like sexier looking
like he's got perfect features.

2916
02:50:25,590 --> 02:50:27,720
It's got amazing shit goes wrong.

2917
02:50:28,170 --> 02:50:31,140
It goes wrong when it
comes down to fucking,

2918
02:50:31,290 --> 02:50:33,660
you're going to want that
crossfit girl kind of want.

2919
02:50:33,690 --> 02:50:37,860
I want that girl can push our way
through a spin class and I as the mental

2920
02:50:37,861 --> 02:50:42,060
toughness, just keep on, do a 90
minute cross or yoga class. Yeah.

2921
02:50:42,061 --> 02:50:46,620
You don't want a girl who's got like
perfect genes but she's lazy. No. Hell No.

2922
02:50:48,720 --> 02:50:52,740
And she just takes Adderall for a few days
before her big shoots. He doesn't eat.

2923
02:50:53,540 --> 02:50:56,880
Look at that thing. That's a Ford
Gt. That's a gross color though.

2924
02:50:56,940 --> 02:51:00,960
I saw one in a sick blue collar. It
looked amazing for tours. Killer fuck.

2925
02:51:00,961 --> 02:51:05,040
You look at the body on that
thing. No Color Dan. I'm out. Yeah,

2926
02:51:05,041 --> 02:51:08,670
find a better color Jamie. Fuck off
of this color. Those headlights on.

2927
02:51:08,671 --> 02:51:11,640
Do anything for me to
see in a better angle.

2928
02:51:11,670 --> 02:51:15,540
Give me the blue and white for God's
sakes is America for fuck sakes. Shave.

2929
02:51:15,560 --> 02:51:16,410
God Damn it.

2930
02:51:16,470 --> 02:51:20,610
I'm not a fan of red with
white red with white stripes.

2931
02:51:21,510 --> 02:51:25,530
I like red with black stripes. That
looks blue with white. That's right.

2932
02:51:25,730 --> 02:51:27,990
I like wait. That's America.
Like we think Margo.

2933
02:51:28,230 --> 02:51:32,370
Mark, what do you got?
Well, we'll look at this.

2934
02:51:35,160 --> 02:51:39,390
Oh, you nailed it. Jamie black with red
stripes. That might be put. Look at that.

2935
02:51:40,110 --> 02:51:44,160
Jesus Christ. Look with the exhaust
pipes come out in the back like that.

2936
02:51:44,900 --> 02:51:48,840
That that might be the best
looking car. Fuck, I got to agree.

2937
02:51:48,841 --> 02:51:52,010
That thing is sad.
That might be the best car ever.

2938
02:51:52,050 --> 02:51:56,460
Those giant Brembo brakes in the
front. I can't listen forward. Gimme

2939
02:51:58,140 --> 02:52:02,380
gimme a some manual not make
it hard to get right to.

2940
02:52:03,090 --> 02:52:06,040
Yeah, but it's also a double clutch. Come

2941
02:52:06,040 --> 02:52:09,370
on forward. You know Jay Leno has
probably got six of them that fuck. Yeah,

2942
02:52:09,371 --> 02:52:10,330
there's like 50 of them.

2943
02:52:10,331 --> 02:52:14,350
Jay Leno takes 10 j Seinfeld
takes 20 of them were all fuck.

2944
02:52:14,351 --> 02:52:17,400
Lebron James has got one and Bron
James might want to jump every house.

2945
02:52:17,480 --> 02:52:21,890
Kevin Hart jumps in your Kevin
Hart's got one minute on a gold damn.

2946
02:52:22,090 --> 02:52:25,420
Look at that thing though.
Holy Shit. That's the perfect
color jam. You nailed it.

2947
02:52:25,421 --> 02:52:29,500
Yeah, you've hit it black
with red stripes. I never
knew black with red stripes.

2948
02:52:29,501 --> 02:52:32,230
Like so bad ass and with
the lights in the back.

2949
02:52:33,400 --> 02:52:34,760
That's amazing looking.

2950
02:52:36,570 --> 02:52:41,500
It's sounds so good. There's
a lot of people right now.
Mad At us. Yeah, the pith,

2951
02:52:42,050 --> 02:52:43,680
the two of them cars again bro.
Hey,

2952
02:52:43,681 --> 02:52:48,500
we gave you three hours of Dicks and uh,
what else were we talking about?

2953
02:52:48,501 --> 02:52:51,690
Nate Diaz. Drama Diaz.
The Cardinal Gregor. Fine.

2954
02:52:51,710 --> 02:52:55,230
How about we went over Mars attacks.
That's right.

2955
02:52:55,350 --> 02:52:57,720
They'll get mad at us
because we like cars.

2956
02:52:58,080 --> 02:52:59,420
We talked about the shit we like about,

2957
02:52:59,440 --> 02:53:02,490
I really enjoy the automotive engineering.

2958
02:53:07,350 --> 02:53:10,830
We could bring this home. Let's bring
this bitch off this weekend folks.

2959
02:53:10,890 --> 02:53:15,650
Fight companion returns Saturday night.
Stephan sky straight per screw.

2960
02:53:15,690 --> 02:53:20,370
Struve's crew versus a Alexandra Volkov
right? That's his name. That's right.

2961
02:53:20,371 --> 02:53:22,250
And I'm in a COBB's comedy club,

2962
02:53:22,251 --> 02:53:26,940
September 14th and then I'm in Long
Beach Laugh factory, Long Beach,

2963
02:53:26,941 --> 02:53:31,080
September 22nd two fat k.com for
tickets and the comedy store.

2964
02:53:31,980 --> 02:53:36,310
That's right. Oh, Jesus. What a lineup.

2965
02:53:36,330 --> 02:53:39,210
It's probably sold out in Sam triple
he Sam triply show. That's right.

2966
02:53:39,211 --> 02:53:43,720
It's might be sold out already,
but if it's not, go online,
uh, it's on calm. Sure.

2967
02:53:43,721 --> 02:53:47,520
There. It's on the comedy store's
website and my Instagram on my Instagram.
