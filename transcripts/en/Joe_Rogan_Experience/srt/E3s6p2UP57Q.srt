1
00:00:02,370 --> 00:00:03,510
Five,
four,

2
00:00:03,570 --> 00:00:04,980
three,
two,

3
00:00:05,340 --> 00:00:09,390
one Yamaha.
And realize my good friend Doug Dorin.

4
00:00:09,391 --> 00:00:11,190
Hello Douglas.
Hello Joe Rogan,

5
00:00:11,191 --> 00:00:12,690
who to see or so away,
man,

6
00:00:12,691 --> 00:00:13,524
dude.
And uh,

7
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:15,090
Brian Richards,
your friend,

8
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:18,900
a wildlife biologist and um,
well we're going to talk about a bunch

9
00:00:18,901 --> 00:00:20,250
of things,
but one of the things that I wanted to

10
00:00:20,251 --> 00:00:23,910
talk about is this scary disease that
uh,

11
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:26,990
well when Ted nugent was on the podcast,
uh,

12
00:00:27,090 --> 00:00:32,090
he downplayed the consequences and
effects of something called cwd or

13
00:00:33,241 --> 00:00:37,710
chronic wasting disease,
which has made it onto your farm and you

14
00:00:37,711 --> 00:00:41,580
live in Wisconsin and you have this
beautiful place that we visited when we

15
00:00:41,581 --> 00:00:46,050
did the immediate or television show.
And this is a new thing that this

16
00:00:46,051 --> 00:00:47,940
chronic wasting disease was just,
just,

17
00:00:48,370 --> 00:00:51,480
it decimates the deer's health and kills
them.

18
00:00:51,870 --> 00:00:56,870
And the suspicion is that some of us at
least comes from these high fence

19
00:00:59,071 --> 00:01:02,710
operations where people grow dear,
um,

20
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:05,460
and treat them like,
instead of like a wild animal,

21
00:01:05,461 --> 00:01:09,240
they treat them like a domesticated
animal and have them all feeding off of

22
00:01:09,241 --> 00:01:13,860
the same pile of food and they share
this disease.

23
00:01:13,861 --> 00:01:15,930
Is this all correct and accurate?
Brian

24
00:01:16,180 --> 00:01:18,340
boy,
you just started out about an hour's

25
00:01:18,341 --> 00:01:21,730
worth of congress.
Um,

26
00:01:22,030 --> 00:01:23,290
so yeah,
just a little bit.

27
00:01:23,291 --> 00:01:25,120
I'm a,
I'm a wildlife biologist with the

28
00:01:25,150 --> 00:01:28,480
national wildlife health center,
US geological survey up in Madison,

29
00:01:28,481 --> 00:01:29,740
Wisconsin.
And so,

30
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:32,170
uh,
one of the things that I spend a lot of

31
00:01:32,171 --> 00:01:36,190
time on is chronic wasting disease.
I wouldn't say that makes me necessarily

32
00:01:36,191 --> 00:01:38,950
an expert,
but I've gotten to know a lot of people

33
00:01:38,951 --> 00:01:41,110
that I would call experts over the
years.

34
00:01:41,170 --> 00:01:43,200
So I've gained a little bit of
knowledge.

35
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:45,480
So I don't,
I mean your,

36
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:47,710
your statement there,
we could start a number of different

37
00:01:47,711 --> 00:01:48,544
places

38
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:50,290
this disease.
Um,

39
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:52,710
essentially,
well,

40
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:56,820
describe what it does do these animals
and why it's such a major concern.

41
00:01:56,821 --> 00:02:01,030
It hasn't jumped to humans yet that
we're aware that we're aware of,

42
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:03,810
but it is a possibility,
a very real possibility.

43
00:02:03,930 --> 00:02:06,000
We can't rule it out at this point in
time.

44
00:02:06,001 --> 00:02:08,550
Science is unable to rule it out.
So,

45
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:09,990
okay,
that's a great place to start.

46
00:02:10,050 --> 00:02:13,740
Why would we care about this thing
called chronic wasting disease?

47
00:02:14,250 --> 00:02:17,520
And I would argue in,
in some other scientists have argued

48
00:02:17,521 --> 00:02:21,210
there's two major reasons.
Number one is the impacts of this

49
00:02:21,211 --> 00:02:24,060
disease on members of the deer family
themselves.

50
00:02:24,660 --> 00:02:29,660
And the other is that we cannot rule out
the possibility that cwd could become a

51
00:02:30,031 --> 00:02:32,100
human health issue at some point down
the road.

52
00:02:32,310 --> 00:02:35,430
Guys,
you kind of nailed those two with regard

53
00:02:35,431 --> 00:02:38,780
to deer or members of the deer family,
whitetail deer,

54
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:40,050
mule deer,
elk,

55
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:42,570
Moose,
and most recently it was picked up in,

56
00:02:42,571 --> 00:02:45,810
in reindeer,
in Norway of all places.

57
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:46,880
Um,
we,

58
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:51,300
we could articulate some reasons,
some rationale why this disease might be

59
00:02:51,301 --> 00:02:55,470
thought of as being important.
First we look at is would be geographic

60
00:02:55,471 --> 00:02:56,304
spread.

61
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:57,810
So,
you know,

62
00:02:57,811 --> 00:03:02,811
cwd 20 years ago was thought to be this
really novel thing in a very restricted

63
00:03:03,221 --> 00:03:05,560
geographic range in south eastern
Wyoming,

64
00:03:05,890 --> 00:03:09,460
adjacent North Eastern Colorado,
and maybe a little spill over and in

65
00:03:09,461 --> 00:03:11,890
Nebraska,
a wildlife biologist,

66
00:03:11,891 --> 00:03:14,380
wildlife disease specialist looked at
this disease.

67
00:03:14,381 --> 00:03:15,780
It was interesting.
Uh,

68
00:03:16,030 --> 00:03:18,550
we didn't know much about it at that
point in time,

69
00:03:18,551 --> 00:03:23,550
but it seemed to be very isolated there.
What does it do to the dear Kilz dare,

70
00:03:24,060 --> 00:03:25,310
right.
But how does it kill him?

71
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:29,020
Alright,
so this is a member of a family of

72
00:03:29,021 --> 00:03:32,610
diseases called transmissible spongiform
encephalopathy.

73
00:03:32,611 --> 00:03:35,250
These are tss.
So big long words.

74
00:03:35,260 --> 00:03:37,550
Transmissible means it can go from
animal aid.

75
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:42,600
Animal be spongiform means looks like a
sponge and encephalopathy means disease

76
00:03:44,591 --> 00:03:46,600
of the brain.
So you put it together.

77
00:03:46,750 --> 00:03:51,730
And so this disease results in holes in
the brain resulting in progressive

78
00:03:51,850 --> 00:03:55,150
neurological degeneration followed by
death.

79
00:03:55,420 --> 00:03:56,111
Okay.
It's a,

80
00:03:56,111 --> 00:03:57,710
it's a death sentence and there's no,

81
00:03:58,090 --> 00:04:00,430
or for it,
it's not like you can capture the deer

82
00:04:00,431 --> 00:04:02,050
and give them some sort of metal

83
00:04:02,070 --> 00:04:05,140
cation.
No cure for these diseases.

84
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:07,300
The sweeter diseases.
You know,

85
00:04:07,301 --> 00:04:10,540
there's a,
there's a members of the TSC group of

86
00:04:10,541 --> 00:04:13,210
diseases in humans.
Most familiar is,

87
00:04:13,211 --> 00:04:15,490
is one called crites veiled Jacobes
disease.

88
00:04:15,910 --> 00:04:19,630
So it's very similar to mad cow disease
in the same family.

89
00:04:19,650 --> 00:04:21,020
Second one,
the champions.

90
00:04:21,370 --> 00:04:23,550
Well,
I'd say [inaudible] you could say price,

91
00:04:23,830 --> 00:04:24,970
honestly.
I'll just read it.

92
00:04:26,410 --> 00:04:27,850
It's an interesting,
you know,

93
00:04:27,851 --> 00:04:28,684
there's,
uh,

94
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:31,060
uh,
goes back and forth on whether it's pre

95
00:04:31,061 --> 00:04:34,180
honor,
prion stand poisoner to receive the

96
00:04:34,181 --> 00:04:37,030
Nobel laureate for his work on these
diseases,

97
00:04:37,031 --> 00:04:41,470
coined the term to prion.
And in his first publication describing

98
00:04:41,471 --> 00:04:43,780
these diseases,
he did a phonetic spelling and it's

99
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:46,180
prion.
So other researchers,

100
00:04:46,181 --> 00:04:47,870
it's especially,
you know,

101
00:04:48,030 --> 00:04:49,930
um,
some from across the pond,

102
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:52,210
um,
say it's gotta be prion.

103
00:04:52,660 --> 00:04:53,830
And the main reason that,
you know,

104
00:04:53,831 --> 00:04:57,520
some of them I've talked to about that
is that an ERC stand poizner when he

105
00:04:57,521 --> 00:04:58,930
hears it called Prion.
Oh,

106
00:04:58,931 --> 00:04:59,910
so we'll say Priyanka.

107
00:04:59,970 --> 00:05:02,130
Yeah.
So I'll say prion from now on this

108
00:05:02,131 --> 00:05:04,920
disease,
which people know as mad cow disease,

109
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:06,420
um,
obviously,

110
00:05:06,450 --> 00:05:08,970
uh,
is transmissible to humans.

111
00:05:09,330 --> 00:05:12,630
And um,
that's one of the reasons why people are

112
00:05:12,631 --> 00:05:17,400
very scared that this could potentially
jump from deer into humans.

113
00:05:17,401 --> 00:05:21,540
And correct me if I'm wrong,
but it also is making its way into the

114
00:05:21,541 --> 00:05:23,730
actual plants that these animals eat.

115
00:05:24,380 --> 00:05:27,280
You're correct on both accounts show
with BSE,

116
00:05:27,460 --> 00:05:31,450
mad cow disease.
That was an interesting disease where it

117
00:05:31,451 --> 00:05:33,520
resulted from,
in essence,

118
00:05:33,521 --> 00:05:36,280
turning cows into cannibals.
We were,

119
00:05:36,340 --> 00:05:38,550
which all cyclists in New Guinea,
right with KCC,

120
00:05:39,130 --> 00:05:40,620
Coatesville with,
with crew,

121
00:05:40,810 --> 00:05:42,620
which is a human,
uh,

122
00:05:42,621 --> 00:05:47,621
disease.
A tsc likely started when one individual

123
00:05:47,741 --> 00:05:50,890
developed Roitfeld Jacobes disease.
That individual died.

124
00:05:51,220 --> 00:05:54,160
And as,
as a practice was the practice in the,

125
00:05:54,161 --> 00:05:56,400
for a tribe in Papa New Guinea,
uh,

126
00:05:56,540 --> 00:06:01,460
they practice ritualized cannibalism to
honor the dead and to help release the

127
00:06:01,461 --> 00:06:04,850
spirits from you now deceased family
members.

128
00:06:05,270 --> 00:06:07,430
So they would feed upon,
uh,

129
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:10,820
upon the corpse and port and you know,
the bodies of their deceased.

130
00:06:11,150 --> 00:06:15,410
So when one individual died of probably
some variant of Coatesville Jakob's

131
00:06:15,411 --> 00:06:18,020
disease,
then the causative agent,

132
00:06:18,021 --> 00:06:21,200
the prion protein,
which is concentrated in the central

133
00:06:21,201 --> 00:06:24,090
nervous system and lymphatic systems of,
you know,

134
00:06:24,230 --> 00:06:27,920
of disease patients,
this was fed back to other members of

135
00:06:27,921 --> 00:06:29,720
the family and the extended family.

136
00:06:30,290 --> 00:06:33,350
And so when they got sick and died
veteran again,

137
00:06:33,470 --> 00:06:36,220
so we saw that with brew,
um,

138
00:06:36,230 --> 00:06:37,063
in,
uh,

139
00:06:37,070 --> 00:06:41,210
in the 19 abused in 1960 around there,
um,

140
00:06:41,211 --> 00:06:46,160
it was realized that this cannibalistic
behavior was likely the result,

141
00:06:46,250 --> 00:06:47,310
you know,
or the right view,

142
00:06:47,330 --> 00:06:51,290
the cause of disease transmission,
cannibalism was outlawed.

143
00:06:51,890 --> 00:06:55,280
And at that point in time,
you broke completely the d disease

144
00:06:55,281 --> 00:06:59,540
transmission cycle.
So no more new cases of Kourou,

145
00:06:59,930 --> 00:07:04,460
but they had lingering cases with an
extended incubation period up to 40

146
00:07:04,461 --> 00:07:08,660
years later before Kourou finally burned
out of that population.

147
00:07:09,690 --> 00:07:13,070
So now with,
with BSC or mad cow disease,

148
00:07:13,490 --> 00:07:15,860
we were doing exactly in essence the
same thing,

149
00:07:15,861 --> 00:07:17,840
not exactly the same thing,
but in essence.

150
00:07:18,170 --> 00:07:23,170
So in an effort to maximize production
and reduce the amount of waste when they

151
00:07:24,381 --> 00:07:29,070
butchered cattle,
we would take all the awful Oh ffa l you

152
00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:30,980
have the high,
the bones,

153
00:07:30,981 --> 00:07:35,660
the parts that are inedible and we would
had rendered them cook them at high

154
00:07:35,661 --> 00:07:37,730
temperature and typically,
you know,

155
00:07:37,731 --> 00:07:39,260
high pressure as well.

156
00:07:39,650 --> 00:07:42,620
And it turns into a slurry high protein
slurry.

157
00:07:42,860 --> 00:07:47,000
You skim the fat off the top of that and
then dehydrate the rest of it.

158
00:07:47,210 --> 00:07:48,110
And you have,
you know,

159
00:07:48,111 --> 00:07:51,200
kind of a meat and bone meal,
a high protein supplement,

160
00:07:51,530 --> 00:07:55,130
realizing that cattle grow faster and
produce better when they're,

161
00:07:55,190 --> 00:07:59,510
when on a hyper higher protein diet,
it seemed reasonable to use waste

162
00:07:59,511 --> 00:08:03,740
material from cows to feed back to cows.
So at some point,

163
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:05,113
turning,
turning,

164
00:08:05,780 --> 00:08:07,220
turning thousand,
the candles.

165
00:08:07,790 --> 00:08:12,410
So at some point in time a cow developed
a TSC,

166
00:08:12,411 --> 00:08:14,600
a prion disease,
whether it came from scrapey,

167
00:08:14,601 --> 00:08:18,260
the tsc of sheep or arose on its own is
unknown.

168
00:08:18,710 --> 00:08:23,150
But that cow died.
It was rendered into meat and bone meal

169
00:08:23,180 --> 00:08:27,200
and this high protein feed was then fed
out to hundreds to thousands.

170
00:08:27,260 --> 00:08:29,130
And correct me if I'm wrong,
for these crayons,

171
00:08:29,390 --> 00:08:33,560
they could survive up to more than a
thousand degree temperature.

172
00:08:33,950 --> 00:08:35,600
Yeah.
Surviving is kind of a,

173
00:08:35,601 --> 00:08:37,520
a strange term,
Joe in,

174
00:08:37,670 --> 00:08:40,580
they're not alive to start with.
It's a protein a,

175
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:44,120
they can persist,
they cannot be inactivated.

176
00:08:44,121 --> 00:08:45,020
So yeah,
it to,

177
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:48,230
he's to Cook Pretty Harley.
These premiums are not necessarily the

178
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:51,770
living thing like a disease or a virus
or a bacteria.

179
00:08:52,130 --> 00:08:54,260
Well,
they're a disease causing agent,

180
00:08:54,380 --> 00:08:56,790
but they are incredibly unique.
They're so,

181
00:08:56,791 --> 00:09:01,791
they're an edl logic agent,
like a virus or bacteria or a parasite

182
00:09:01,951 --> 00:09:05,910
could be causing disease.
But all these other things have genetic

183
00:09:05,911 --> 00:09:07,440
material.
They're alive,

184
00:09:07,860 --> 00:09:11,460
which allows them to change rapidly to
evolve over time.

185
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:14,220
So the,
the whole concept that you have a

186
00:09:14,221 --> 00:09:18,390
protein,
a protein that all mammals produce in a

187
00:09:18,391 --> 00:09:23,391
normal form can be converted after
production into a disease associated

188
00:09:25,231 --> 00:09:28,650
form that has these radically different
characteristics.

189
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:30,150
One that you mentioned was,
you know,

190
00:09:30,151 --> 00:09:32,100
resistance to heat,
heat treatment,

191
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:34,110
a normal prion protein.

192
00:09:34,110 --> 00:09:37,350
And we have billions of them circulating
in our bodies right now.

193
00:09:37,860 --> 00:09:39,900
Um,
have a specific purposes,

194
00:09:39,901 --> 00:09:42,270
cellular purpose,
we don't know exactly what it is,

195
00:09:42,271 --> 00:09:45,690
but it's likely involved in some sort of
intracellular communication.

196
00:09:46,350 --> 00:09:51,350
It's a string of around 250 amino acids,
so relatively short protein.

197
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:55,770
It does whatever it's does,
and then the body recycles,

198
00:09:55,771 --> 00:10:00,750
breaks that chain of amino acids down
into its component parts and recycles

199
00:10:00,751 --> 00:10:02,520
it.
It turns out that normal.

200
00:10:02,521 --> 00:10:06,390
So we would preamp protein likely has a
half life of maybe four to six hours.

201
00:10:06,540 --> 00:10:08,580
Okay,
so you're producing them relatively

202
00:10:08,581 --> 00:10:12,260
constantly.
Then there's the disease associated form

203
00:10:12,390 --> 00:10:17,390
in all diseases associated prions start
as the normal cellular Priya.

204
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:22,770
So they're converted from one,
three dimensional form to a different

205
00:10:22,771 --> 00:10:24,150
form.
Okay.

206
00:10:24,570 --> 00:10:27,990
And this different form has these
radically different characteristics.

207
00:10:27,991 --> 00:10:31,380
One is heat resistance and other is UV
light resistance.

208
00:10:31,830 --> 00:10:33,850
Um,
I mentioned that the normal cellular

209
00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:37,050
prion protein has a half life of maybe
four to six hours.

210
00:10:37,380 --> 00:10:41,040
The disease associated ones can persist
in the environment for years and

211
00:10:41,041 --> 00:10:42,990
potentially up to decades.
Okay.

212
00:10:42,991 --> 00:10:43,824
And when you say persistent,

213
00:10:43,830 --> 00:10:48,090
the environment,
you mean in like on the ground on

214
00:10:48,091 --> 00:10:50,190
leaves,
on like how would they be,

215
00:10:50,630 --> 00:10:51,830
yeah,
all of those things.

216
00:10:51,831 --> 00:10:54,380
Just through,
so if a deer,

217
00:10:55,220 --> 00:10:58,790
Moose sheds infectious agent,
this prion protein,

218
00:10:59,420 --> 00:11:02,900
and so yeah,
from the time of deer is infected,

219
00:11:02,901 --> 00:11:05,330
it's probably around two years before it
develops.

220
00:11:05,331 --> 00:11:08,360
Clinical signs of disease goes down,
he'll lose as it's fear,

221
00:11:08,361 --> 00:11:11,280
a human's dramatic weight loss.
Um,

222
00:11:11,330 --> 00:11:14,360
all of those things,
that incubation period,

223
00:11:14,510 --> 00:11:17,090
you know,
it's probably shedding infectious agent

224
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:20,570
for the vast majority of that time
period.

225
00:11:20,630 --> 00:11:23,990
So it looks healthy,
but it's able of transmitting disease.

226
00:11:24,110 --> 00:11:26,710
We'd call that Ala typhoid Mary Syndrome
Syndrome.

227
00:11:27,010 --> 00:11:28,480
The two deer that we,
uh,

228
00:11:28,540 --> 00:11:31,270
that were positive on our farm,
two bucks,

229
00:11:31,510 --> 00:11:34,210
two and a half year old bucks were we
had them tested.

230
00:11:34,211 --> 00:11:34,900
As you know,
we're,

231
00:11:34,900 --> 00:11:36,310
for the last several years we've been
getting,

232
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,920
uh,
initially we got our,

233
00:11:39,390 --> 00:11:41,950
uh,
only bucks tested and then the last

234
00:11:42,490 --> 00:11:44,770
three or four years we've gotten all the
deer tested.

235
00:11:45,190 --> 00:11:47,020
They were a two and a half year old
bucks,

236
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:48,730
perfectly look,
perfectly healthy.

237
00:11:48,780 --> 00:11:52,210
And these are the first ones that you've
tested that tested positive and we

238
00:11:52,300 --> 00:11:53,133
tested

239
00:11:54,730 --> 00:11:58,250
in excess of 35 deer over the last,
well more than happy,

240
00:11:58,270 --> 00:12:00,430
more than like 50 during the incubation
period.

241
00:12:00,431 --> 00:12:03,130
Would they still test positive at some
point?

242
00:12:03,131 --> 00:12:05,860
They will at some point.
So that could be spreading infectious

243
00:12:05,861 --> 00:12:07,980
agents without testing positive.
Yes.

244
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:14,640
So it's say it's probably between three
and six months out when we can test an

245
00:12:14,741 --> 00:12:18,400
animal test positive,
but it's likely shedding infectious

246
00:12:18,401 --> 00:12:22,540
agent at least at lower quantities prior
to that point in time.

247
00:12:23,230 --> 00:12:26,560
And so then he said it's shedding
infectious agent.

248
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:31,540
It's capable of transmitting disease and
cave long before it looks clinically

249
00:12:31,541 --> 00:12:32,380
ill.
That's,

250
00:12:32,381 --> 00:12:34,540
that's one of the real challenges with
this disease.

251
00:12:34,541 --> 00:12:38,020
From a management standpoint,
they look perfectly healthy,

252
00:12:38,170 --> 00:12:41,980
they act perfectly healthy,
but they're starting to have that

253
00:12:41,981 --> 00:12:46,981
progressive neurological degeneration
that we can only see very near the end

254
00:12:47,441 --> 00:12:48,880
of disease.
So,

255
00:12:49,060 --> 00:12:52,570
correct me if I'm wrong,
but this seems like we could potentially

256
00:12:52,571 --> 00:12:56,710
be facing a ticking time bomb of many,
many,

257
00:12:56,711 --> 00:13:00,190
many deer that are wandering around out
there right now that look totally

258
00:13:00,191 --> 00:13:01,960
normal,
that are spreading this stuff all over

259
00:13:01,961 --> 00:13:04,240
the place and they're,
they're acting normally look perfectly

260
00:13:04,241 --> 00:13:05,074
healthy.

261
00:13:05,260 --> 00:13:09,070
And then obviously with this multi year
incubation period,

262
00:13:09,490 --> 00:13:14,020
this kid just cascade and I think we've
seen evidence of that now.

263
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:15,580
Um,
started at,

264
00:13:15,581 --> 00:13:18,610
you know,
he talked about being isolated disease.

265
00:13:18,611 --> 00:13:23,290
It was picked up in Wisconsin at the end
of 2001 as of today,

266
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:26,980
cwd has been,
now penn picked up in 25 states in

267
00:13:26,981 --> 00:13:30,460
captive and or free ranging populations
in whitetail deer,

268
00:13:30,461 --> 00:13:31,780
mule deer,
elk or Moose,

269
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:34,610
two Canadian provinces,
uh,

270
00:13:34,870 --> 00:13:37,900
in addition to two is picked up in South
Korea.

271
00:13:38,650 --> 00:13:42,730
And that was real interesting.
It was in captive elk and those elk

272
00:13:42,731 --> 00:13:47,731
still had Canadian ear tags in them.
So we pretty much know how cwd those

273
00:13:48,251 --> 00:13:53,251
Elkton swim across the Pacific pond.
Most recently it was picked up two years

274
00:13:54,131 --> 00:13:59,131
ago in free ranging reindeer in Norway.
And subsequent to that,

275
00:13:59,381 --> 00:14:04,180
it was picked up in a small handful,
like three or four moose and a red deer

276
00:14:04,420 --> 00:14:07,300
in Norway in a single moose in Finland.

277
00:14:07,930 --> 00:14:12,790
It's a real concern over in Norway,
um,

278
00:14:12,850 --> 00:14:15,070
with reindeer.
Okay.

279
00:14:15,071 --> 00:14:17,420
So reindeer are very gregarious,
you know,

280
00:14:17,421 --> 00:14:18,330
whitetail,
deer,

281
00:14:18,350 --> 00:14:19,990
Caribou,
Caribou,

282
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:23,800
reindeer.
So not unusual to see him in herds of

283
00:14:23,830 --> 00:14:25,930
hundreds of animals.
So very,

284
00:14:25,931 --> 00:14:29,310
very different than what we see with
whitetail deer,

285
00:14:29,340 --> 00:14:30,640
mule deer,
elk,

286
00:14:30,641 --> 00:14:32,880
or Moose.
We don't see those huge hurts.

287
00:14:32,890 --> 00:14:34,600
Met with elk.
You can in the wintertime.

288
00:14:35,260 --> 00:14:37,270
But anyway,
it's thought that this gregarious

289
00:14:37,271 --> 00:14:41,320
behavior might really facilitate
transmission in reindeer.

290
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:44,500
Right?
So when it was picked up in reindeer,

291
00:14:44,940 --> 00:14:45,940
nor we said,
you know,

292
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:49,210
we maybe should do something.
It's an interesting story.

293
00:14:49,211 --> 00:14:50,700
And um,
you know,

294
00:14:50,710 --> 00:14:55,700
Norway has got experience with scrapey
in sheep and so they have a long

295
00:14:55,701 --> 00:14:56,930
history.
What is scrappy?

296
00:14:56,960 --> 00:15:00,890
Scrappy is the same as well.
It's the same family diseases and sheep.

297
00:15:01,370 --> 00:15:04,880
It's actually the first one that was
described scrapey we've known about

298
00:15:04,881 --> 00:15:09,320
since the early 17 hundreds a disease,
a domestic sheep,

299
00:15:09,620 --> 00:15:12,680
and it's called scrapey because of the
behavior of these animals,

300
00:15:12,681 --> 00:15:16,730
once they enter the clinical phase of
disease display and they,

301
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,980
they seem like they itch bat.

302
00:15:19,010 --> 00:15:22,400
And so they'll go up to fence posts and
other objects and they will literally

303
00:15:22,401 --> 00:15:26,090
rub their hide off of their body.
So that's the name scraping.

304
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:29,990
And it's the same progressive
neurological disorder followed by death.

305
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:35,270
I think about it.
So as this disease creates vacuums in

306
00:15:35,271 --> 00:15:37,940
the brain,
it's killing off neurons.

307
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:41,900
And so without those neurons firing,
you fall into that progressive

308
00:15:41,901 --> 00:15:44,930
degeneration.
And yet at some point your body can no

309
00:15:44,931 --> 00:15:47,360
longer survive.
And that's what's really spooky about

310
00:15:47,361 --> 00:15:49,640
how this thing kills.
So anyway,

311
00:15:49,641 --> 00:15:53,240
go back to Norway when they detected
cwt.

312
00:15:53,241 --> 00:15:54,570
Trying to keep this a little bit closer
to you.

313
00:15:55,110 --> 00:15:56,860
You're very soft spoken.
Oh no worries.

314
00:15:56,861 --> 00:15:58,370
I'll talk.
I can hear myself.

315
00:15:58,371 --> 00:16:00,260
Plenty of the problem.
Is that recording?

316
00:16:00,270 --> 00:16:01,103
I'm sorry.
Okay,

317
00:16:01,130 --> 00:16:04,850
no worries.
So when they picked up cwd and reindeer

318
00:16:04,851 --> 00:16:09,851
in Norway and the researchers over there
had witnessed what we are lack of

319
00:16:11,121 --> 00:16:14,480
success on this side of the pond over
the course of the last 20 years,

320
00:16:15,030 --> 00:16:16,670
they took it very,
very seriously.

321
00:16:17,060 --> 00:16:19,250
Um,
so they took kind of some harsh

322
00:16:19,251 --> 00:16:20,470
medicine.
Uh,

323
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:24,560
they announced their plans that they
were going to eliminate a herd unit.

324
00:16:24,561 --> 00:16:29,420
They were going to kill every rain deer
in an entire herd unit in Norway.

325
00:16:30,140 --> 00:16:33,560
The idea is to eliminate the host
population.

326
00:16:33,561 --> 00:16:36,140
It's called stamping out,
and it works in a pen.

327
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:39,920
This is the first time had been done
realistically in a free ranging

328
00:16:39,921 --> 00:16:41,390
population.
Oh,

329
00:16:41,391 --> 00:16:43,130
ideas.
We don't have effective tools for

330
00:16:43,131 --> 00:16:46,250
management as disease.
They were very fearful of what would

331
00:16:46,251 --> 00:16:50,780
happen if this spread throughout that
reindeer population and throughout other

332
00:16:50,810 --> 00:16:52,940
reindeer herds.
And like Alaska,

333
00:16:52,941 --> 00:16:57,750
they have multiple herds.
Like last year I hunted Caribou with,

334
00:16:57,800 --> 00:16:58,930
with Steve up in the,
uh,

335
00:16:59,170 --> 00:17:00,800
uh,
40 mile river area,

336
00:17:01,250 --> 00:17:03,440
but there were,
and so they're very,

337
00:17:03,620 --> 00:17:04,730
uh,
we'll localize.

338
00:17:04,731 --> 00:17:07,280
This is probably not,
but at least they have a range that they

339
00:17:07,281 --> 00:17:07,850
move through.

340
00:17:07,850 --> 00:17:11,210
So,
and then in Norway they have two or

341
00:17:11,211 --> 00:17:13,070
three different herds,
many more than that.

342
00:17:13,250 --> 00:17:17,190
So I don't know exactly how many heard
you could isolate of the herd.

343
00:17:17,270 --> 00:17:21,590
So the idea is before this gets to be
any worse before it gets any farther,

344
00:17:22,070 --> 00:17:25,430
let's take it out.
So they had a hunting season,

345
00:17:25,460 --> 00:17:28,340
they allowed a hunter's to take as many
as they could,

346
00:17:28,370 --> 00:17:30,440
which was a little over a thousand range
here.

347
00:17:30,690 --> 00:17:32,420
And then they came in with government
agents.

348
00:17:32,450 --> 00:17:37,450
But it's sharp concern that the hunters
could eat something with cwd and then

349
00:17:37,521 --> 00:17:40,220
catch it.
Well that's always a concern.

350
00:17:40,250 --> 00:17:43,430
But what we can talk about human health,
let me finish this one up though,

351
00:17:43,730 --> 00:17:46,100
with Norway.
And it took,

352
00:17:46,670 --> 00:17:50,220
literally took the bull by the horns.
They decided to do what was very

353
00:17:50,221 --> 00:17:52,620
unpopular,
what we have not been able to do in

354
00:17:52,621 --> 00:17:54,480
North America,
they,

355
00:17:54,481 --> 00:17:57,690
and so after the hunting season,
government agent sharpshooters took an

356
00:17:57,691 --> 00:18:02,130
additional 1400 reindeer as they killed
every reindeer in this herd unit and

357
00:18:02,131 --> 00:18:05,820
they're going to keep it foul,
allow no reindeer in there for a minimum

358
00:18:05,821 --> 00:18:09,840
of five years.
So it says every bit of promise of being

359
00:18:09,841 --> 00:18:14,070
the first large scale success with
dealing with this disease in a free

360
00:18:14,071 --> 00:18:18,630
ranging heard pretty different than what
we've been able to accomplish over here

361
00:18:18,690 --> 00:18:19,650
five years.

362
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:20,730
Is that,
uh,

363
00:18:21,180 --> 00:18:26,150
with it being in the soil and dirt from
what I was reading,

364
00:18:26,151 --> 00:18:28,370
wouldn't everything else is that,
um,

365
00:18:28,700 --> 00:18:31,180
so at some point there becomes a,
the,

366
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:36,230
the [inaudible] um,
diminishing population or they die out

367
00:18:36,231 --> 00:18:39,320
or whatever the proper word.
I mean they're not living so they don't

368
00:18:39,321 --> 00:18:41,630
die.
But if I become viable anymore,

369
00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:43,770
yeah,
five years is probably a pretty good,

370
00:18:43,860 --> 00:18:45,450
it's a guesstimate.
Okay.

371
00:18:45,451 --> 00:18:49,770
As well with regard to how long these
prions remain viable in the,

372
00:18:49,771 --> 00:18:52,500
in the environment and in the substrate.
So it's a,

373
00:18:52,510 --> 00:18:54,900
it's a good first guess.
And what,

374
00:18:55,260 --> 00:18:58,380
what they'll do then is slowly allowed
reindeer to repopulate.

375
00:18:58,770 --> 00:19:01,380
And as they do,
they'll be harvested periodically and

376
00:19:01,381 --> 00:19:03,360
every one of those will be tested.
So,

377
00:19:03,361 --> 00:19:06,660
I mean it will be a long term experiment
into,

378
00:19:06,780 --> 00:19:09,260
you know,
successful management and also learned

379
00:19:09,261 --> 00:19:14,130
quite a bit about whether how far along
the environment was contaminated.

380
00:19:14,610 --> 00:19:16,860
So those thing,
they caught this disease very early.

381
00:19:16,950 --> 00:19:18,540
So after killing off,
you know,

382
00:19:18,541 --> 00:19:21,780
2,400 reindeer,
I think they had around 20 positives.

383
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:25,020
So very low prevalence,
suggesting the disease was very,

384
00:19:25,021 --> 00:19:29,190
very new in this system.
If you're going to be successful with a

385
00:19:29,191 --> 00:19:32,070
disease where animals are shedding
infectious agent out into the

386
00:19:32,071 --> 00:19:34,620
environment,
it persist for years to decades.

387
00:19:35,100 --> 00:19:37,650
Do it early.
If you're gunna get on it,

388
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:39,930
get detected early,
get on it fast,

389
00:19:39,931 --> 00:19:42,780
get on at heart.
Why the decision to let human beings

390
00:19:42,781 --> 00:19:45,930
consumed them?
Well at this point in time that we

391
00:19:46,020 --> 00:19:51,020
really don't have any evidence that,
that humans can get cwd could that

392
00:19:51,181 --> 00:19:53,220
potentially though be an incubation
period issue?

393
00:19:53,221 --> 00:19:55,530
Just like it is with deer may be
extended with humans.

394
00:19:55,740 --> 00:19:59,040
Cause you were talking about how do you,
it was the correct pronunciation.

395
00:19:59,041 --> 00:20:00,810
I was pronouncing it wrong.
No,

396
00:20:00,811 --> 00:20:01,130
no,
no.

397
00:20:01,130 --> 00:20:06,130
W or Jakub [inaudible] disease.
So that has a long incubation period in

398
00:20:09,331 --> 00:20:10,260
human beings.
Correct?

399
00:20:10,890 --> 00:20:12,190
Likely.
Yeah.

400
00:20:12,420 --> 00:20:14,070
And mad cow.
Same thing.

401
00:20:14,220 --> 00:20:16,410
Extended incubation period.
Kourou could,

402
00:20:16,411 --> 00:20:17,580
you know,
some of the cases,

403
00:20:17,581 --> 00:20:20,910
it looks like we're up maybe even to 40,
maybe even 50 year incubation.

404
00:20:20,911 --> 00:20:22,110
Prts individually,

405
00:20:22,650 --> 00:20:25,800
I'm talking about crew for me because
every time I talked to this guy,

406
00:20:26,610 --> 00:20:30,870
I mean I've learned a lot from him about
all kinds of things and diseases.

407
00:20:30,871 --> 00:20:31,704
But,
uh,

408
00:20:31,830 --> 00:20:34,140
yesterday we were talking about Kourou
and I'm,

409
00:20:34,141 --> 00:20:37,380
one of the things that was interesting
to me about it is that these tribes,

410
00:20:37,860 --> 00:20:41,970
the women and children contracted it.
Yeah,

411
00:20:41,971 --> 00:20:43,380
that's true.
Isn't that interesting?

412
00:20:43,950 --> 00:20:47,980
And the reason why was the man ate the
meat and the women

413
00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:49,450
and children,
it,

414
00:20:49,451 --> 00:20:53,750
the internal organs,
the internal organs as well as

415
00:20:53,830 --> 00:20:58,830
concentrated as coolaroo took off.
It was one of the features as the

416
00:20:59,021 --> 00:21:00,400
researchers in the,
you know,

417
00:21:00,401 --> 00:21:04,300
in the 50s and in 1950s we're looking at
the population.

418
00:21:04,650 --> 00:21:08,920
Um,
very few adult males had Kourou and it

419
00:21:08,921 --> 00:21:11,890
was more focused in the females and the
children.

420
00:21:12,100 --> 00:21:17,100
And so it came back to that ritualistic,
you'll cannibalism and he hit it right

421
00:21:18,671 --> 00:21:19,810
on the head.
Um,

422
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:22,120
the women and children got to internal
organs,

423
00:21:22,390 --> 00:21:25,720
including the brain that have the
highest concentration of the,

424
00:21:25,790 --> 00:21:28,210
of the prion protein,
the man,

425
00:21:28,211 --> 00:21:31,540
if they consumed anything,
consumed the finer cuts of meat,

426
00:21:31,990 --> 00:21:35,200
which have a lower concentration but not
now.

427
00:21:36,040 --> 00:21:37,900
So I don't know,
that's just one of those social things

428
00:21:37,901 --> 00:21:40,360
that just kind of stuck with me.
You know,

429
00:21:40,420 --> 00:21:41,650
it is kind of,
it's pretty,

430
00:21:41,710 --> 00:21:43,030
pretty interesting story.

431
00:21:43,110 --> 00:21:45,540
Well,
a bunch of people reached out and some,

432
00:21:45,541 --> 00:21:48,960
some were very angry after Ted nugent
was on the podcast.

433
00:21:48,961 --> 00:21:49,650
And,
uh,

434
00:21:49,650 --> 00:21:52,220
I don't know how cwd got brought up.
I don't,

435
00:21:52,250 --> 00:21:54,960
I don't know what the context was.
I don't remember.

436
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:59,100
But I remember him saying that winter
kills more animals than cwd does.

437
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:02,310
And uh,
many people were very angry that this

438
00:22:02,311 --> 00:22:05,850
was a gross simplification of what could
be a ticking time bomb.

439
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:08,170
I guess I would,
yeah,

440
00:22:08,171 --> 00:22:10,660
I'd have to agree with that.
Um,

441
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:14,650
his other disease out there called
epizootic hemorrhagic disease,

442
00:22:14,670 --> 00:22:19,670
he ahd and periodically you'll have
significant outbreaks of this disease.

443
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:24,020
And in,
in northern latitudes where the disease

444
00:22:24,021 --> 00:22:28,780
is not been present has often you can
see dramatic mortality.

445
00:22:28,870 --> 00:22:33,550
80 90% of our herd can be killed in a
single event,

446
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:38,620
but a very distinction between these
diseases.

447
00:22:39,150 --> 00:22:43,660
You know,
Ehd is spread by midges little black,

448
00:22:43,661 --> 00:22:45,150
no seams,
okay.

449
00:22:46,010 --> 00:22:47,950
Sabbagh,
he actually transmits,

450
00:22:48,130 --> 00:22:51,700
transmits the disease,
the virus from Adelaide animal be here

451
00:22:51,701 --> 00:22:53,920
from the environment to animal a either
one.

452
00:22:54,430 --> 00:22:57,940
So while you have these pretty dramatic
die offs,

453
00:22:58,270 --> 00:23:00,790
as soon as the weather changes after the
first frost,

454
00:23:00,791 --> 00:23:04,990
the first hard frost kills off the
midges and within about two weeks,

455
00:23:04,991 --> 00:23:09,991
the disease cycle is broken completely.
So it has significant impacts on a

456
00:23:10,811 --> 00:23:14,830
localized level periodically.
But the disease cycle,

457
00:23:14,831 --> 00:23:18,910
there's a definite end to the disease
cycle and then it's no longer present.

458
00:23:19,370 --> 00:23:23,020
Well then for that period of time and
for a period of time anywhere the virus

459
00:23:23,021 --> 00:23:26,500
may persist in the environment,
but once the transmission cycle is

460
00:23:26,501 --> 00:23:29,230
broken,
the mortality he snob and isn't there,

461
00:23:30,030 --> 00:23:32,720
uh,
genetically engineered food plots that

462
00:23:32,721 --> 00:23:37,520
they're putting together now or
different types of seed that a inhibits

463
00:23:37,550 --> 00:23:40,970
midge growth and inhibits the HD?
I'm not aware of that,

464
00:23:40,971 --> 00:23:43,310
but I wouldn't doubt it.
And I think there's also some stuff

465
00:23:43,311 --> 00:23:46,070
they're doing that bolsters animal's
immune

466
00:23:46,070 --> 00:23:47,000
system.
They're,

467
00:23:47,001 --> 00:23:48,980
they're supplementing some of the,
the,

468
00:23:48,981 --> 00:23:51,980
the food with a,
I don't know what they're using,

469
00:23:51,981 --> 00:23:53,960
but it bolsters the animal's immune
system.

470
00:23:53,961 --> 00:23:58,380
It makes them less susceptible to it.
And populations that had been histo just

471
00:23:58,490 --> 00:24:03,490
are exposed to Ehd over time.
Definitely develop a herd immunity to

472
00:24:04,641 --> 00:24:06,980
it.
And as the HD transferable to humans,

473
00:24:07,790 --> 00:24:08,450
no,
we don't,

474
00:24:08,450 --> 00:24:10,970
not that we've ever seen.
There's no evidence that it is,

475
00:24:10,971 --> 00:24:13,520
this is a disease that deer and it,
you know,

476
00:24:13,530 --> 00:24:15,710
it's,
it also can get into livestock.

477
00:24:15,740 --> 00:24:18,110
So even if people get bitten by these
midges,

478
00:24:18,140 --> 00:24:21,790
there's still no concern that we could
potentially get adhd.

479
00:24:21,890 --> 00:24:26,000
No.
So contrast that this disease ehd with a

480
00:24:26,001 --> 00:24:28,850
very definite end to the transmission
cycle.

481
00:24:28,851 --> 00:24:32,180
First Frost kills off the midges with
cwd.

482
00:24:32,300 --> 00:24:36,710
There's no known ecological factor,
which signals the end of the

483
00:24:36,711 --> 00:24:39,380
transmission cycle.
So that's why we see prevalence or the

484
00:24:39,381 --> 00:24:44,000
proportion of animals that are positive
in individual locations in individual

485
00:24:44,001 --> 00:24:44,660
hurts.

486
00:24:44,660 --> 00:24:46,130
It just keeps going up,
up,

487
00:24:46,131 --> 00:24:48,330
up in captive.
Um,

488
00:24:48,530 --> 00:24:49,910
facilities,
uh,

489
00:24:49,911 --> 00:24:52,370
the,
the hall farm in Wisconsin where cewd

490
00:24:52,371 --> 00:24:54,560
was first detected in 2002,
the,

491
00:24:54,561 --> 00:24:59,561
the place was depopulated in 2006
prevalence was nearly 80%.

492
00:24:59,901 --> 00:25:03,860
So four out of five deer in that cap of
servant facility had it.

493
00:25:04,040 --> 00:25:07,400
Wow.
More recently we had a farm,

494
00:25:07,401 --> 00:25:12,401
a deer farm in Iowa where in know
disease had gone undetected for some

495
00:25:12,441 --> 00:25:16,280
period of time.
And when the herd was depopulated again

496
00:25:16,281 --> 00:25:18,860
about 80% prevalence,
but this was a big hurts.

497
00:25:18,861 --> 00:25:23,150
There were over 200 positives in this
single high fenced enclosure.

498
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:27,200
And so winners not going to change that.
It grows.

499
00:25:27,230 --> 00:25:31,160
So no stop.
There's no known feature which stops the

500
00:25:31,161 --> 00:25:35,810
transmission cycle.
And so when you say that something like

501
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:37,880
ehd kills a lot of deer,
yes,

502
00:25:37,881 --> 00:25:40,820
it does.
With the disease transmission cycle

503
00:25:40,821 --> 00:25:44,520
stops with cwd.
We don't know anything that's not

504
00:25:44,521 --> 00:25:45,354
opposite.

505
00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:50,800
It's
Ehd is more like the flu or you had it

506
00:25:51,221 --> 00:25:52,510
on your,
your farm esd?

507
00:25:52,511 --> 00:25:53,344
Never.
No,

508
00:25:53,610 --> 00:25:55,240
no.
Let me rephrase that.

509
00:25:55,250 --> 00:25:57,550
I not that I'm aware of.
Um,

510
00:25:58,150 --> 00:25:58,983
and,
uh,

511
00:25:59,170 --> 00:26:01,840
so when I learned about Ehd and you
know,

512
00:26:01,841 --> 00:26:03,340
comparative,
uh,

513
00:26:03,370 --> 00:26:06,130
diseases,
you chronic wasting diseases,

514
00:26:07,060 --> 00:26:09,130
like none other,
it,

515
00:26:09,190 --> 00:26:10,023
it,
uh,

516
00:26:10,650 --> 00:26:12,970
uh,
as it develops within the herd,

517
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:17,020
as it develops within the animal,
it just continues to grow.

518
00:26:17,021 --> 00:26:19,480
So it'll start out as a very small
problem.

519
00:26:19,860 --> 00:26:22,930
Um,
there's some maps of how it developed or

520
00:26:22,931 --> 00:26:26,530
how it spread in the,
in the southwest Wisconsin and we're on

521
00:26:26,531 --> 00:26:28,510
the front edge of it now.
Um,

522
00:26:28,990 --> 00:26:31,570
and it's all correct me if I'm wrong,
Brian,

523
00:26:31,571 --> 00:26:34,210
but it's like,
it's almost like the way it develops

524
00:26:34,211 --> 00:26:39,211
within the deer taking that period of
time before it becomes a clinical and

525
00:26:39,851 --> 00:26:44,100
the deer dies.
It's almost as if that's reflective

526
00:26:44,100 --> 00:26:46,890
of how it moves from the landscape and
moves very slowly.

527
00:26:47,340 --> 00:26:48,960
But once it's there,
it's there.

528
00:26:49,380 --> 00:26:54,060
Now I have read about hunters eating
meat from some sort of disease,

529
00:26:54,061 --> 00:26:57,870
deer and getting sick and dying.
What would that be?

530
00:27:00,840 --> 00:27:03,580
Misreporting would have been possibly,
I mean,

531
00:27:03,590 --> 00:27:04,890
I shouldn't,
I shouldn't say that.

532
00:27:04,891 --> 00:27:05,980
I mean,
I don't know the,

533
00:27:06,120 --> 00:27:09,080
there there've been instances where,
um,

534
00:27:09,150 --> 00:27:14,150
people that hunted deer later died of a
prion disease likely developed

535
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:16,170
Crutchfield,
the outcomes disease.

536
00:27:16,590 --> 00:27:21,590
Okay.
And so was it the deer that gave it to

537
00:27:21,901 --> 00:27:22,381
them?
Well,

538
00:27:22,381 --> 00:27:27,240
there's no epidemiological evidence that
this occurs at this point in time.

539
00:27:27,450 --> 00:27:30,390
And we've hinted about some of the,
the human health issues.

540
00:27:30,391 --> 00:27:35,391
So there's a few things we can look at
in areas where cwd is known to exist.

541
00:27:36,060 --> 00:27:40,470
Do we see higher mortality rates from
Christ spelled Jacobes disease?

542
00:27:40,650 --> 00:27:42,060
The,
does he have a prion disease,

543
00:27:42,061 --> 00:27:44,040
have humans than we do elsewhere?

544
00:27:44,300 --> 00:27:45,990
The answer is no.
Okay.

545
00:27:46,230 --> 00:27:51,180
So from an epidemiological standpoint,
there's no evidence that cwd has crossed

546
00:27:51,181 --> 00:27:56,181
over that species barrier into humans.
Now we can take a look at a number of,

547
00:27:57,150 --> 00:28:01,050
of science experiments that have been
conducted and at least in,

548
00:28:01,080 --> 00:28:05,520
in some of these studies,
in experimental models,

549
00:28:05,700 --> 00:28:10,700
we have evidence that the cwd prion
protein can cause human normal prions to

550
00:28:13,861 --> 00:28:16,920
convert to a disease associated form.
Okay.

551
00:28:17,220 --> 00:28:19,170
But now these are models.
Okay.

552
00:28:19,171 --> 00:28:22,440
They're not,
it's not quite the same as pumping cwd

553
00:28:22,470 --> 00:28:25,800
into the brain of a,
of a human patient and seeing what's

554
00:28:25,850 --> 00:28:27,090
what developed.
Okay.

555
00:28:27,630 --> 00:28:32,630
So the science suggests that there is a
small nonzero chance that cwd could

556
00:28:34,950 --> 00:28:39,300
become a human health issue.
There's also some of the more recent

557
00:28:39,301 --> 00:28:43,440
science that's been conducted suggest
that this barrier,

558
00:28:43,441 --> 00:28:48,180
we call it the species barrier and it,
and it really is a very robust barrier.

559
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:53,240
One would think that keeps CD wg cwd
from crossing into human hosts.

560
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:58,770
That barrier may not be as tough as we
think it is and that barrier may be

561
00:28:58,771 --> 00:29:02,490
changing over time.
Is that because one of the things we've

562
00:29:02,491 --> 00:29:06,780
talked about before is that they've
discovered different strains of cwd.

563
00:29:06,840 --> 00:29:07,790
Yeah,
it sure is.

564
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:12,100
Don't choose.
So yes ma'am.

565
00:29:12,210 --> 00:29:14,640
It gets worse.
It's fascinating.

566
00:29:14,641 --> 00:29:17,210
It's fascinating stuff.
You got to get to that point.

567
00:29:17,220 --> 00:29:19,620
It's fascinating.
It's definitely fascinating,

568
00:29:19,621 --> 00:29:21,140
but it's scaring the shit out of me
already.

569
00:29:21,450 --> 00:29:23,580
So yeah,
the idea is strange.

570
00:29:23,581 --> 00:29:26,850
It's really interesting with scraping,
I mentioned that disease a sheep,

571
00:29:26,851 --> 00:29:31,851
we recognize some 30 different strains
and it's still all that same identical

572
00:29:32,971 --> 00:29:37,110
strand of amino acids.
And it's shaped that tertiary form must

573
00:29:37,111 --> 00:29:41,070
be slightly different and it manifests
slightly differently and sheep.

574
00:29:41,080 --> 00:29:42,420
So,
um,

575
00:29:43,450 --> 00:29:48,450
now with cwd there's at least two are
recognized strains that have been

576
00:29:48,581 --> 00:29:50,620
published in peer reviewed literature.

577
00:29:51,130 --> 00:29:53,860
There's probably more strains out there.
In fact,

578
00:29:53,861 --> 00:29:55,120
it's,
it's kind of interesting.

579
00:29:55,121 --> 00:29:58,390
There was a,
there was a paper done a couple years

580
00:29:58,390 --> 00:30:02,380
ago which looked at the actual,
the architecture of this disease

581
00:30:02,381 --> 00:30:04,450
associated prion protein.
And there's a,

582
00:30:04,451 --> 00:30:08,980
there's a portion of it that's referred
to as a loop structure and it's just

583
00:30:08,981 --> 00:30:09,581
kind of,
you know,

584
00:30:09,581 --> 00:30:13,480
if you take a rubber band and or a piece
of yarn or something and ball it up into

585
00:30:13,481 --> 00:30:16,600
a three dimensional shape,
there's a little loop hanging off the

586
00:30:16,601 --> 00:30:21,601
side of this disease associated prion
protein and in deer and cwd,

587
00:30:22,810 --> 00:30:25,660
that loop is very,
very rigid.

588
00:30:25,810 --> 00:30:29,540
Okay.
It's very inflexible,

589
00:30:29,710 --> 00:30:34,710
shall we say in humans.
It is more of a flexible loop as opposed

590
00:30:35,291 --> 00:30:38,890
to the rigid loop.
And it's thought that this difference in

591
00:30:38,891 --> 00:30:42,280
that architecture is part is partially,
you know,

592
00:30:42,281 --> 00:30:45,470
controls that species barrier.
Okay.

593
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:48,160
So I was telling Doug that paper
yesterday,

594
00:30:48,650 --> 00:30:49,483
it's pretty cool.

595
00:30:49,540 --> 00:30:53,110
It's pretty neat stuff actually.
It was right zone.

596
00:30:53,530 --> 00:30:57,760
So now it turns out mice,
experimental laboratory mice,

597
00:30:58,360 --> 00:31:02,830
they're prion protein has the same
structure as the human pre Honda's.

598
00:31:02,920 --> 00:31:07,210
Okay,
so you cannot give cwd to a normal

599
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:09,820
laboratory mouse.
They just don't get it.

600
00:31:10,150 --> 00:31:13,650
And it's likely this different,
some of this difference in their prion

601
00:31:13,660 --> 00:31:16,420
structure,
this one cannot convert that one to a

602
00:31:16,421 --> 00:31:20,440
different form.
So some researchers in Alberta,

603
00:31:20,940 --> 00:31:24,850
um,
identified a strain of cwd which came

604
00:31:24,851 --> 00:31:27,430
from wild deer.
So it's not something they engineered in

605
00:31:27,431 --> 00:31:31,480
the laboratory.
They have a strain from wild deer that

606
00:31:31,630 --> 00:31:36,630
does give mice cwd fuck.
So most of the strains out there,

607
00:31:37,330 --> 00:31:40,270
mice can't get,
but they discovered one that mice do

608
00:31:40,271 --> 00:31:43,750
get.
So researchers from a few years ago,

609
00:31:43,751 --> 00:31:47,560
and lately I've seen it in the,
in the popular media that hey,

610
00:31:47,561 --> 00:31:51,340
this difference in this loop structure
is going to keep people from getting

611
00:31:51,341 --> 00:31:52,210
cwd.

612
00:31:53,350 --> 00:31:53,861
Well,
the,

613
00:31:53,861 --> 00:31:56,560
all the,
all the assumptions that people can't

614
00:31:56,561 --> 00:32:01,561
get cwd are based that on this idea that
cwt is cwd and it will always be exactly

615
00:32:03,281 --> 00:32:06,580
the same thing.
But our experience with scrapey strongly

616
00:32:06,581 --> 00:32:09,660
suggests that even though there's no,
um,

617
00:32:09,850 --> 00:32:13,930
there's no dna in these things,
that they do change over time.

618
00:32:13,931 --> 00:32:16,360
They morph over time into slightly
different,

619
00:32:16,610 --> 00:32:18,640
uh,
disease characteristics and etiologic

620
00:32:18,790 --> 00:32:20,290
agents.
Now,

621
00:32:20,350 --> 00:32:24,160
in the hunting community,
is there skepticism about this as Ted

622
00:32:24,160 --> 00:32:27,430
nugent's ideas?
Are these unique or is this a common

623
00:32:27,431 --> 00:32:31,030
thought that,
or is it a convenient thought for them

624
00:32:31,031 --> 00:32:34,730
because they don't want it to be real?
It's,

625
00:32:34,750 --> 00:32:36,780
it's a challenge,
um,

626
00:32:37,090 --> 00:32:38,950
of education.
Yeah.

627
00:32:39,720 --> 00:32:40,110
Mostly

628
00:32:40,110 --> 00:32:43,090
just in whatever period of time that we
talked here and it's,

629
00:32:43,380 --> 00:32:45,410
you know,
it's really complicated in it it,

630
00:32:46,360 --> 00:32:49,850
and to get to the,
you almost want to stick your head in

631
00:32:49,851 --> 00:32:52,030
the sand and just forget about it,
you know,

632
00:32:52,040 --> 00:32:54,380
besides of the sort of things that,
you know,

633
00:32:54,381 --> 00:32:57,290
your friend that we were talking about
before that like I was doing on the farm

634
00:32:57,680 --> 00:32:58,280
of,
you know,

635
00:32:58,280 --> 00:33:01,760
managing deer in a particular way for a
particular kind of deer,

636
00:33:02,230 --> 00:33:04,760
um,
which might be contrary to the,

637
00:33:05,030 --> 00:33:06,370
to the spread of the disease.
So He's,

638
00:33:06,410 --> 00:33:08,520
nobody wants to hear that I can't do
what I want it

639
00:33:09,220 --> 00:33:11,830
do management.
We're talking about management wise and

640
00:33:11,831 --> 00:33:13,390
we were talking about my friend John
Dudley's,

641
00:33:13,391 --> 00:33:18,391
a farm in Iowa is that he only shoots
the big mature males and he lets all the

642
00:33:19,781 --> 00:33:23,800
other deal grow to a very large size.
So he has a really healthy population of

643
00:33:23,801 --> 00:33:27,910
big deer on his farm.
Now what are you doing in your place?

644
00:33:27,911 --> 00:33:30,460
I understand you're just on a mass call.

645
00:33:31,790 --> 00:33:36,020
Well,
I feel like I'm on the front edge of,

646
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:38,330
well,
I don't feel like I am on the front end

647
00:33:38,331 --> 00:33:40,940
of the spread of this disease.
And there's some in Wisconsin and

648
00:33:40,941 --> 00:33:42,530
Wisconsin,
southwest Wisconsin.

649
00:33:42,531 --> 00:33:45,740
So 15 years ago when,
uh,

650
00:33:45,770 --> 00:33:49,630
or 16 years ago when cwd was discovered,
there were a lot of changes in,

651
00:33:49,680 --> 00:33:50,513
in,
uh,

652
00:33:50,750 --> 00:33:54,980
hunting structure and there was an
effort by the Department of natural

653
00:33:54,981 --> 00:33:59,170
resources to eradicate the disease,
uh,

654
00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:00,290
in,
in the,

655
00:34:00,470 --> 00:34:02,750
the core area south of the Wisconsin
River,

656
00:34:02,751 --> 00:34:05,190
about 70 miles from us.
Um,

657
00:34:05,420 --> 00:34:09,650
in 15 years the disease has moved 70
miles north.

658
00:34:10,150 --> 00:34:14,000
Um,
that effort that the dnr started was,

659
00:34:14,390 --> 00:34:16,100
um,
became political.

660
00:34:16,240 --> 00:34:16,870
Um,
and,

661
00:34:16,870 --> 00:34:17,311
you know,
and,

662
00:34:17,311 --> 00:34:20,870
and quite honestly that many years ago,
um,

663
00:34:21,350 --> 00:34:24,230
I would have likely been a little
skeptic.

664
00:34:24,260 --> 00:34:25,580
Well,
I know I would have been skeptical.

665
00:34:25,581 --> 00:34:28,550
You want me to do what?
They wanted to kill all the deer in a

666
00:34:28,551 --> 00:34:30,530
particular area.
You know,

667
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:32,390
that many years ago had they come to my
farm and said,

668
00:34:32,391 --> 00:34:35,540
we're going to kill all the deer here
and all the near the neighboring dear,

669
00:34:36,050 --> 00:34:38,300
I would have had some real hard
questions.

670
00:34:38,630 --> 00:34:43,220
I have no idea how I would react to it.
I continued to do like buck management

671
00:34:43,221 --> 00:34:44,900
and you know,
you were there when we were still doing

672
00:34:44,901 --> 00:34:46,160
that.
Um,

673
00:34:46,940 --> 00:34:48,830
and uh,
and there's,

674
00:34:48,980 --> 00:34:51,110
we can talk about,
you know,

675
00:34:52,010 --> 00:34:54,170
how,
how bucks contribute to the spread of

676
00:34:54,171 --> 00:34:56,390
the disease and,
and that sort of thing.

677
00:34:56,660 --> 00:34:58,850
Uniquely versus doe.
Um,

678
00:35:00,930 --> 00:35:05,930
we see different prevalence or curves
depending on the demographic faction of

679
00:35:07,861 --> 00:35:09,840
deer,
adult males,

680
00:35:10,170 --> 00:35:12,510
the ones with the big hours.
Um,

681
00:35:12,630 --> 00:35:16,860
but gears on the law over there tend to
have higher prevalence sometimes,

682
00:35:16,861 --> 00:35:17,820
maybe two,
three,

683
00:35:17,821 --> 00:35:21,660
four times as high as other segments of
the population.

684
00:35:22,080 --> 00:35:26,220
So highest prevalence and adult males
followed by adult females and then by

685
00:35:26,221 --> 00:35:28,080
juvenile animals.
So,

686
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:33,000
um,
so it's likely behavioral reasons why we

687
00:35:33,001 --> 00:35:36,570
see that in adult males.
So adult male deer,

688
00:35:36,750 --> 00:35:38,040
uh,
during the Rut or

689
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:40,770
breeding season,
they greatly expand their home range.

690
00:35:40,771 --> 00:35:44,250
They contact multiple,
a female or a family,

691
00:35:44,251 --> 00:35:48,240
groups of females earlier in the fall,
especially with the white tail deer,

692
00:35:48,510 --> 00:35:51,420
adult males tend to gather in these
bachelor groups.

693
00:35:51,450 --> 00:35:55,050
So there's a lot of social contact.
I'm grooming,

694
00:35:55,051 --> 00:35:57,810
things like that.
So because of their behavior,

695
00:35:58,080 --> 00:36:00,990
they contact more animals at different
times of the year.

696
00:36:01,260 --> 00:36:04,860
And this number of contacts,
it's believed it's likely responsible

697
00:36:04,861 --> 00:36:06,150
for them,
uh,

698
00:36:06,300 --> 00:36:10,710
becoming infected at a higher rate than
other members out in the herd.

699
00:36:11,100 --> 00:36:15,090
So now if you are an adult male,
then you're in the,

700
00:36:15,091 --> 00:36:17,550
in this group,
you also have a higher likelihood of

701
00:36:17,551 --> 00:36:21,690
being able to transmit disease to other
animals because you're out there during

702
00:36:21,691 --> 00:36:22,880
breeding season,
isn't it?

703
00:36:23,060 --> 00:36:27,200
Is there any evidence that w that any of
these deer have transferred this to

704
00:36:27,201 --> 00:36:31,340
livestock or that it's God into
agriculture,

705
00:36:31,390 --> 00:36:34,010
the food sources to corn and what have
you that could,

706
00:36:34,011 --> 00:36:35,800
could be consumed by people even that
are veggies.

707
00:36:35,900 --> 00:36:38,370
[inaudible] okay,
interesting questions.

708
00:36:38,371 --> 00:36:41,760
So with regard to transmission into
cattle,

709
00:36:42,090 --> 00:36:45,210
it's basically the same situation as
with humans.

710
00:36:45,570 --> 00:36:50,340
No evidence that it has,
but in an experimental sense we can push

711
00:36:50,341 --> 00:36:52,710
it over that species bear here.
Okay.

712
00:36:53,220 --> 00:36:56,430
Now,
interesting you bring up plants because

713
00:36:56,610 --> 00:37:00,810
we have shown a research that we've done
at the National Wildlife Health Center

714
00:37:01,170 --> 00:37:05,910
has shown that if you grow some plant
types in a slurry,

715
00:37:05,940 --> 00:37:10,940
I concentrate a prion protein that those
odds can be uptaken through the roots

716
00:37:12,300 --> 00:37:15,550
and deposited into stems and leaves.
Hmm.

717
00:37:15,870 --> 00:37:18,990
Okay.
And so that's one possible mechanism.

718
00:37:19,410 --> 00:37:24,410
A second is that Cypriots himselves a
disease associated pre hands tend to

719
00:37:25,330 --> 00:37:28,710
form very tight chemical bonds with
various surfaces.

720
00:37:28,711 --> 00:37:32,220
Like showed him a paper on the way out
here yesterday where they bind to just

721
00:37:32,221 --> 00:37:34,860
about anything.
They bind the plants as well.

722
00:37:35,370 --> 00:37:38,670
So that deer that's out there with cwd
positives,

723
00:37:38,671 --> 00:37:40,860
shedding infectious agent out into the
environment,

724
00:37:40,861 --> 00:37:42,600
through its urine,
through its saliva,

725
00:37:42,630 --> 00:37:43,650
through its feces.

726
00:37:43,980 --> 00:37:48,690
So if a deer urinates as dear cwd
urinates on plants,

727
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:54,200
the prions have a tendency to bind to
those plants form a chemical bond.

728
00:37:54,421 --> 00:37:57,990
It's not just drying on,
it forms a chemical bond to the plants

729
00:37:57,991 --> 00:37:59,970
and literally become part of the planet.
It's,

730
00:38:00,540 --> 00:38:01,440
yeah.
Okay.

731
00:38:01,860 --> 00:38:06,860
So a deer could eat those plants and
that could be one of the possible

732
00:38:07,081 --> 00:38:10,140
transmission mechanisms.
So that's a second one.

733
00:38:10,260 --> 00:38:15,260
The third one has a,
we speculated about and some folks

734
00:38:15,901 --> 00:38:19,320
who've looked at in,
in it has potential impacts for,

735
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:21,570
um,
agricultural commodities.

736
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:24,240
So when cdot video was,
you know,

737
00:38:24,241 --> 00:38:26,070
20,
30 years ago was really,

738
00:38:26,071 --> 00:38:28,380
really rare,
you probably couldn't happen.

739
00:38:28,381 --> 00:38:33,150
But now it's in 25 states,
vast geographic areas we have,

740
00:38:33,151 --> 00:38:35,710
I'm just south of where he lives

741
00:38:36,010 --> 00:38:39,370
in adult males,
nearly 50% prevalence.

742
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:42,280
So when you kill that big buck,
take a coin out of your pocket,

743
00:38:42,281 --> 00:38:44,230
flip it in the air,
and that's odds at that deer.

744
00:38:44,231 --> 00:38:46,960
I cwd.
And when he says just south,

745
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:48,940
just 15 miles.
Okay,

746
00:38:49,450 --> 00:38:52,510
so now let's go out west.
Yes.

747
00:38:52,511 --> 00:38:53,180
Or,
yeah.

748
00:38:53,180 --> 00:38:57,160
So let's go out to overall in the county
at this point,

749
00:38:57,820 --> 00:39:02,470
let's go up into the big agricultural
areas in Saskatchewan or out west.

750
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:04,840
Okay.
So you got a mule deer herd out there.

751
00:39:04,841 --> 00:39:09,841
We cwd and let's say maybe 20% overall
with that herd is cwd positives.

752
00:39:11,260 --> 00:39:14,800
You've been out in some of those big
wheat fields and hayfields how many mule

753
00:39:14,801 --> 00:39:17,620
deer standing up there before sunset?
Shitload.

754
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:18,761
Yeah.
Okay.

755
00:39:18,761 --> 00:39:22,930
So take that amount times 20% or that
amount,

756
00:39:22,931 --> 00:39:26,610
whatever prep sent,
have cwd figuring out how many times

757
00:39:26,611 --> 00:39:29,920
it's a deer defecate or urinate on a
daily basis.

758
00:39:30,280 --> 00:39:34,030
And that's a bunch.
And now think about the possibility that

759
00:39:34,031 --> 00:39:38,890
when you harvest those agricultural food
stuffs and roll it up into big bales,

760
00:39:39,220 --> 00:39:43,690
that you might have fecal material
rolled up into those big bales,

761
00:39:43,900 --> 00:39:45,100
not just Mike,
Right?

762
00:39:45,580 --> 00:39:47,080
I mean,
most likely,

763
00:39:47,380 --> 00:39:49,300
um,
we'd need a graduate student that we

764
00:39:49,301 --> 00:39:50,021
could have,
you know,

765
00:39:50,021 --> 00:39:53,080
pick apart large bales of hay to really
prove that.

766
00:39:53,170 --> 00:39:54,490
Um,
but I mean,

767
00:39:54,540 --> 00:39:58,000
if someone was,
certainly now we're now we're putting

768
00:39:58,001 --> 00:40:02,950
those on semi trailers and moving them
across borders and are those,

769
00:40:03,250 --> 00:40:05,170
could,
is there a possibility that these

770
00:40:05,350 --> 00:40:10,350
agricultural commodities then deer could
come up to them and be infected by

771
00:40:11,381 --> 00:40:13,180
contact?
I think we don't know

772
00:40:13,380 --> 00:40:15,750
wharton to say that,
um,

773
00:40:16,560 --> 00:40:19,380
Brian's a scientist,
these other folks studying that are

774
00:40:19,381 --> 00:40:22,200
scientists and they don't,
you know,

775
00:40:22,490 --> 00:40:25,800
it's evidence and it suggests and they
get attacked for that,

776
00:40:27,140 --> 00:40:29,490
um,
by people who don't want it to be true.

777
00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:30,061
Well,
and,

778
00:40:30,061 --> 00:40:32,430
and you know,
that's how science is attacked anyway,

779
00:40:32,431 --> 00:40:36,060
right?
Because it's hard to speak in absolutes

780
00:40:36,061 --> 00:40:38,250
is a real hard thing to do.
You know,

781
00:40:38,370 --> 00:40:40,110
so it's,
you'll hear him say,

782
00:40:40,320 --> 00:40:43,200
the evidence suggests the information is
this.

783
00:40:43,201 --> 00:40:47,340
I just think that's a real important
distinction to draw here.

784
00:40:47,341 --> 00:40:48,720
When you're,
you're having those kinds of

785
00:40:48,721 --> 00:40:49,441
discussions,
you know,

786
00:40:49,441 --> 00:40:51,120
there are,
people want absolute proof.

787
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:56,080
Proof is hard in a biological world
because there's so many factors out

788
00:40:56,081 --> 00:40:57,730
there.
We can't control for them all.

789
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:01,510
But there are certain tactics that had
been used quite successfully.

790
00:41:01,511 --> 00:41:04,120
It goes all the way back to smoking.
You now when,

791
00:41:04,121 --> 00:41:05,130
uh,
um,

792
00:41:05,350 --> 00:41:06,340
you know,
um,

793
00:41:06,390 --> 00:41:10,300
what the tobacco companies were
attacking science and the whole idea is

794
00:41:10,301 --> 00:41:12,390
to sow the seeds of doubt.
There's a,

795
00:41:12,790 --> 00:41:16,780
we've seen actually merchants of doubt.
We've seen that.

796
00:41:16,810 --> 00:41:21,160
We see the same thing going on with cwd.
So you mentioned it earlier.

797
00:41:21,820 --> 00:41:22,930
Hey,
um,

798
00:41:23,290 --> 00:41:25,090
you know,
cwd it's not so bad.

799
00:41:25,180 --> 00:41:27,310
What about winter kill?
What about Ehd?

800
00:41:28,360 --> 00:41:31,480
So instead of focusing on that saying,
don't look here,

801
00:41:31,720 --> 00:41:33,920
look at this one.
This is worse.

802
00:41:33,950 --> 00:41:34,280
Why

803
00:41:34,280 --> 00:41:35,990
aren't you doing something about this
one?

804
00:41:35,991 --> 00:41:39,590
So it's a simple diversion.
Another tactic which is,

805
00:41:39,591 --> 00:41:42,230
and I mean there's some,
there's a body of scientific

806
00:41:42,310 --> 00:41:46,060
approach this because these are an
unrelated issues like Ehd does kill

807
00:41:46,061 --> 00:41:48,130
animals.
Winter Til most certainly kills animals,

808
00:41:48,310 --> 00:41:49,510
but we're not talking about the same,

809
00:41:49,720 --> 00:41:52,350
right?
We're trying to divert the conversation,

810
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:54,130
right?
Another thing is,

811
00:41:54,220 --> 00:41:56,670
it's very easy to do is,
you know,

812
00:41:56,750 --> 00:41:59,530
it's Cherry picking the literature
that's out that's out there.

813
00:41:59,950 --> 00:42:03,820
We saw a real great example of this
about a year ago where,

814
00:42:03,910 --> 00:42:06,070
um,
there's a lot of letters to the editor

815
00:42:06,340 --> 00:42:09,670
being sent into newspapers in areas
where cewd is.

816
00:42:10,210 --> 00:42:11,360
And I think it's,
it's an,

817
00:42:11,430 --> 00:42:13,780
uh,
an attempt to change the conversation.

818
00:42:14,200 --> 00:42:18,940
So they were very careful to use
citations from peer reviewed literature.

819
00:42:19,330 --> 00:42:24,330
And one of the ones they used was they
found that in researchers in Wisconsin

820
00:42:25,690 --> 00:42:30,690
found that cwd was not having a
significant effect on mortality rates

821
00:42:31,870 --> 00:42:35,950
when they studied the disease.
So this is a true statement taken

822
00:42:35,951 --> 00:42:40,951
directly from peer reviewed science.
What they didn't identify was that when

823
00:42:41,290 --> 00:42:46,290
they studied that disease was between
2003 and 2007 10 12.

824
00:42:47,280 --> 00:42:48,760
Yeah,
11 years ago.

825
00:42:49,430 --> 00:42:54,430
Then the next sentence in the paper was
our study can use as a baseline for

826
00:42:55,181 --> 00:42:59,590
comparison at a later point in time
should disease change over time.

827
00:43:00,130 --> 00:43:05,130
So you mentioned that exponential growth
curve and how early on back in 2003 to

828
00:43:05,351 --> 00:43:10,351
2007 this area disease prevalence was
probably lower than 5%.

829
00:43:10,960 --> 00:43:14,560
Now it shot up in that curve and it's
probably in that,

830
00:43:14,610 --> 00:43:15,940
you know,
25 30,

831
00:43:15,941 --> 00:43:20,680
30 plus percentage range.
So you're cherry picking literature to

832
00:43:20,681 --> 00:43:25,090
make your arguments that even scientists
say this is not having a big effect when

833
00:43:25,091 --> 00:43:28,000
they studied it,
they're just not saying when they

834
00:43:28,001 --> 00:43:28,750
studied it.

835
00:43:28,750 --> 00:43:31,840
Mm.
So as a non scientist,

836
00:43:32,380 --> 00:43:36,370
when I'm looking at here is everyone's
always terrified or the next pandemic

837
00:43:36,371 --> 00:43:37,840
disease,
and this is one of the reasons why I

838
00:43:37,841 --> 00:43:40,600
felt was so important to discuss this
because you know,

839
00:43:40,601 --> 00:43:43,030
people would say they look at it
casually good,

840
00:43:43,031 --> 00:43:45,310
don't eat animals,
don't eat deer.

841
00:43:45,311 --> 00:43:47,440
This is,
this is not that.

842
00:43:47,650 --> 00:43:52,150
This is something that has a potential
to reach large scale agriculture.

843
00:43:52,180 --> 00:43:53,040
This is,
I mean if you,

844
00:43:53,050 --> 00:43:55,740
one of the things about your farm,
and we talked about this when we're

845
00:43:55,750 --> 00:43:58,030
there,
it's like these animals are farm animals

846
00:43:58,031 --> 00:44:00,670
almost because they're,
they're absolutely free range.

847
00:44:00,671 --> 00:44:02,650
They're absolutely wild.
When you talk about the deer on your

848
00:44:02,651 --> 00:44:03,760
place,
you don't,

849
00:44:03,790 --> 00:44:05,530
you don't have them controlled in any
way,

850
00:44:05,531 --> 00:44:07,620
but they're feeding off of your corn.
Yeah.

851
00:44:07,690 --> 00:44:10,930
They're eating all this stuff that
people eat their eating.

852
00:44:11,200 --> 00:44:12,220
I mean that's what they eat.

853
00:44:12,220 --> 00:44:13,750
They,
that's one of the reasons why the deer

854
00:44:13,751 --> 00:44:17,480
populations are so enormous in farm
lands is because it's a massive who

855
00:44:17,500 --> 00:44:19,000
super perfect environment.
Yeah.

856
00:44:19,030 --> 00:44:20,890
And it's also one of the reasons why the
so delicious,

857
00:44:20,950 --> 00:44:24,010
so well fed and
you know,

858
00:44:24,011 --> 00:44:25,300
there's so uh,
you know,

859
00:44:25,330 --> 00:44:28,300
nutritionally balanced diets,
but the,

860
00:44:28,320 --> 00:44:32,100
the real,
what what's horrifies me is this

861
00:44:32,130 --> 00:44:37,130
potential for a pandemic disease also
comes with an incubation period and that

862
00:44:38,101 --> 00:44:42,540
we are looking potentially at like if
you just objectively look with no

863
00:44:42,541 --> 00:44:47,220
hysteria and no hyperbole,
you look at the history of diseases,

864
00:44:47,580 --> 00:44:49,100
diseases,
mutate and,

865
00:44:49,160 --> 00:44:54,160
and many of them come from animals.
This is why swine flu and avian flu and

866
00:44:54,841 --> 00:44:59,841
all these different things have actually
come from either farm animals or wild

867
00:44:59,911 --> 00:45:03,270
animals that have somehow or another
manager transmit diseases that have

868
00:45:03,271 --> 00:45:06,990
morphed to mutated and become dangerous
and deadly to human beings.

869
00:45:07,140 --> 00:45:10,410
This to me seems like a ticking time
bomb.

870
00:45:11,080 --> 00:45:16,080
He has a potential one switch one way or
the other like you've observed or

871
00:45:16,741 --> 00:45:21,390
they've observed rather with mice and
this could potentially infect human

872
00:45:21,391 --> 00:45:24,690
beings and spread across the entire
country.

873
00:45:24,691 --> 00:45:25,524
Like wow,
fire.

874
00:45:26,420 --> 00:45:28,400
Well,
we're seeing that spread right now in

875
00:45:28,401 --> 00:45:29,480
deere,
you know,

876
00:45:29,510 --> 00:45:32,960
Salian dear,
we're seeing Yale clear geographic

877
00:45:32,961 --> 00:45:35,540
spread.
We're seeing clear increases in

878
00:45:35,541 --> 00:45:39,590
prevalence and in areas where the
disease has been present the longest

879
00:45:39,800 --> 00:45:43,700
we're seeing population level impacts.
There's a locations in Wyoming where

880
00:45:43,701 --> 00:45:48,701
we've demonstrated where we've proven
that cwd is driving population decline

881
00:45:48,741 --> 00:45:49,780
and dear.
So that's uh,

882
00:45:50,090 --> 00:45:53,390
that encapsulates why we should be
concerned about deer.

883
00:45:53,420 --> 00:45:56,130
And is this an mule deer?
That's a mule deer and in wait,

884
00:45:56,150 --> 00:45:56,520
yeah.

885
00:45:56,520 --> 00:46:00,630
And the mule deer have a,
an extended range in terms of like their

886
00:46:00,631 --> 00:46:02,910
migration.
That's one of the things that we've

887
00:46:02,911 --> 00:46:05,280
realized,
I believe over the last decade,

888
00:46:05,550 --> 00:46:08,610
right?
Is that mule deer travel far mall far

889
00:46:08,611 --> 00:46:11,370
longer and far longer distances on
average

890
00:46:11,500 --> 00:46:14,660
on it.
And we ever saw before I even whitetail

891
00:46:14,661 --> 00:46:16,070
scan.
So there's an interesting,

892
00:46:16,071 --> 00:46:17,390
uh,
research tidbit.

893
00:46:17,391 --> 00:46:19,250
The state of Minnesota,
um,

894
00:46:19,280 --> 00:46:19,920
you know,
they've got,

895
00:46:19,920 --> 00:46:20,753
uh,
uh,

896
00:46:21,020 --> 00:46:25,160
appears to be a fairly recent cwt
outbreak in the southeastern part of the

897
00:46:25,161 --> 00:46:27,560
state.
So they're researchers are really trying

898
00:46:27,561 --> 00:46:30,290
to get ahead of this and figure out what
could move this around.

899
00:46:30,291 --> 00:46:33,230
So they went in and captured deer in an
adjacent area,

900
00:46:33,590 --> 00:46:35,900
but radio telemetry collars on these to
see,

901
00:46:35,901 --> 00:46:38,440
well just how far do they go?
Um,

902
00:46:38,600 --> 00:46:40,850
this was in a,
in an article just about a week ago,

903
00:46:40,900 --> 00:46:43,460
pop popular media article,
so it's not published yet,

904
00:46:43,760 --> 00:46:47,180
but they had a doe,
single doe coward that went 80 miles,

905
00:46:48,650 --> 00:46:52,350
pretty long distance now,
80 miles circular or 80 miles,

906
00:46:52,410 --> 00:46:55,550
40 miles as the crow flies from
[inaudible] Christ.

907
00:46:55,700 --> 00:47:00,320
So in that 80 miles could potentially be
spreading cwd if it was an infected

908
00:47:00,321 --> 00:47:02,870
sure.
Throughout crops throughout.

909
00:47:02,871 --> 00:47:03,860
I mean,
and this is,

910
00:47:04,790 --> 00:47:06,320
and then there's that exponential
growth.

911
00:47:06,321 --> 00:47:07,030
So it's,
yes,

912
00:47:07,030 --> 00:47:08,300
it's there.
Sure.

913
00:47:08,301 --> 00:47:13,100
It takes a long time for it to become a
large problem.

914
00:47:13,280 --> 00:47:16,790
And we're seeing that and we're seeing
that in richland county.

915
00:47:17,330 --> 00:47:19,040
Um,
it crossed the river,

916
00:47:19,760 --> 00:47:22,880
the testing has begun,
surveillance testing has been going on.

917
00:47:23,080 --> 00:47:28,080
It crossed the river and it just keeps
moving and it be in,

918
00:47:29,981 --> 00:47:31,990
again,
all these different plants,

919
00:47:32,110 --> 00:47:35,620
all these different berries.
People could be eating these berries,

920
00:47:35,621 --> 00:47:37,360
eating these plants,
fruits,

921
00:47:37,720 --> 00:47:39,940
vegetables,
all these different things.

922
00:47:39,941 --> 00:47:42,820
And they could be potentially consuming
these pre

923
00:47:43,090 --> 00:47:45,720
well they're being,
I think it's very clear that there's

924
00:47:45,730 --> 00:47:47,680
exposure.
Um,

925
00:47:48,070 --> 00:47:51,280
and I talk with Doug quite a bit about
the difference between exposure and

926
00:47:51,281 --> 00:47:53,200
disease transmission.
Okay.

927
00:47:53,610 --> 00:47:57,700
Um,
so it is certain that lots of humans are

928
00:47:57,701 --> 00:48:02,530
exposed to disease associated prion
protein from cwd,

929
00:48:02,531 --> 00:48:07,510
unlikely from plant materials as well.
Whether that will result in transmission

930
00:48:07,511 --> 00:48:11,380
of disease across that species barrier
is an open question.

931
00:48:11,680 --> 00:48:16,680
We absolutely cannot say it will.
We absolutely cannot say it will not.

932
00:48:17,470 --> 00:48:21,760
It's an open question.
And one thing we can though I identify

933
00:48:21,761 --> 00:48:26,761
very clearly is that the rate of
exposure is increasing exponentially.

934
00:48:27,310 --> 00:48:31,900
As disease has a larger geographic
footprint and prevalence goes up.

935
00:48:32,230 --> 00:48:37,230
More and more hunters are just by simple
math being exposed to that positive

936
00:48:38,291 --> 00:48:40,870
material.
So we're rolling the dice.

937
00:48:40,900 --> 00:48:42,880
And when you do biological experiments,
I mean,

938
00:48:42,881 --> 00:48:47,881
there's a certain likelihood that you'll
see outcome a or outcome be.

939
00:48:48,250 --> 00:48:50,530
So if you keep rolling the dice enough
times,

940
00:48:50,590 --> 00:48:53,650
you might see an alternative outcome.
We cannot rule that out.

941
00:48:54,460 --> 00:48:56,900
So when we talked about this,
when you were on with,

942
00:48:56,901 --> 00:48:57,920
uh,
uh,

943
00:48:58,310 --> 00:49:00,710
with,
with Rinella and I at the farm

944
00:49:01,700 --> 00:49:06,530
immediately podcast number 70 of
you,

945
00:49:07,190 --> 00:49:10,310
Brian,
you put it as the chances are very small

946
00:49:11,030 --> 00:49:16,030
at this point that it can,
and this is what the CDC and the World

947
00:49:16,250 --> 00:49:17,510
Health Organization says,
well,

948
00:49:17,690 --> 00:49:20,870
the chances are very small,
minuscule even,

949
00:49:21,620 --> 00:49:23,930
but they're not zero.
And,

950
00:49:25,010 --> 00:49:27,760
uh,
I'm assuming that we continue to,

951
00:49:27,860 --> 00:49:29,930
that continues to be the,
you know,

952
00:49:29,931 --> 00:49:32,480
the concern.
And I know you're talking a lot of joe

953
00:49:32,481 --> 00:49:33,500
about,
about,

954
00:49:34,010 --> 00:49:37,610
and I get it because after all humans,
um,

955
00:49:38,210 --> 00:49:42,710
but I've actually begun to focus more on
the effect on the,

956
00:49:43,250 --> 00:49:44,390
on the resource,
on the,

957
00:49:44,510 --> 00:49:46,130
on the,
on the deer.

958
00:49:46,250 --> 00:49:48,800
I mean,
I tested positive animals.

959
00:49:49,040 --> 00:49:50,240
Uh,
we,

960
00:49:50,330 --> 00:49:53,210
we properly disposed of the meat,
um,

961
00:49:53,570 --> 00:49:54,890
which is a whole nother,
you know,

962
00:49:55,070 --> 00:49:57,060
line of discussion.
Um,

963
00:49:57,200 --> 00:49:59,330
I'm still eating venison,
but I'm not eating.

964
00:49:59,331 --> 00:50:01,670
Are you testing the animals to eat?
Every one of them.

965
00:50:01,880 --> 00:50:05,630
We test every deer killed on the farm
now.

966
00:50:05,870 --> 00:50:08,540
Uh,
how long when you raise a cow,

967
00:50:08,630 --> 00:50:10,320
how long before you kill it?
Like,

968
00:50:10,330 --> 00:50:14,330
how long do you do grass fed beef?
And this is actually kind of

969
00:50:14,720 --> 00:50:17,460
interesting.
You were talking about the deer

970
00:50:17,840 --> 00:50:22,430
whitetail deer on our place,
eating corn and beans and gmo corn,

971
00:50:22,431 --> 00:50:23,930
gmo beans,
Alfalfa,

972
00:50:23,931 --> 00:50:25,660
whatever they want to eat.
I control it.

973
00:50:25,670 --> 00:50:27,970
What my grass fed beef eat.
I mean,

974
00:50:27,971 --> 00:50:28,260
you're

975
00:50:28,260 --> 00:50:30,450
right.
You're not taking my couch now the one

976
00:50:30,451 --> 00:50:31,910
says hello by the way,
telling us

977
00:50:33,460 --> 00:50:35,240
way.
Um,

978
00:50:35,300 --> 00:50:39,080
but it's very controlled.
So even though my dear [inaudible]

979
00:50:39,380 --> 00:50:43,370
affected your cow well and that they're,
they're not organic,

980
00:50:44,570 --> 00:50:46,290
my cattle are right.
Um,

981
00:50:46,550 --> 00:50:48,620
because it is controlled.
How ironic.

982
00:50:49,430 --> 00:50:52,850
Oh yeah.
I mean you have farm animals in

983
00:50:52,851 --> 00:50:57,851
captivity that organic purely eating
grass as nature intended and you got

984
00:50:57,951 --> 00:51:00,360
deer eating Monsanto corn.
Yeah,

985
00:51:01,690 --> 00:51:06,120
yeah,
yeah.

986
00:51:06,530 --> 00:51:08,360
Um,
and you know,

987
00:51:08,361 --> 00:51:10,290
and,
and before anybody out there,

988
00:51:10,291 --> 00:51:13,600
it gets the idea that my cattle are
confined in a little barnyard or

989
00:51:13,610 --> 00:51:14,720
everything.
That's a big law,

990
00:51:14,750 --> 00:51:15,590
big,
large area,

991
00:51:15,620 --> 00:51:17,290
big pasture.
There are,

992
00:51:17,910 --> 00:51:19,790
you know,
free ranging within that pasture,

993
00:51:20,450 --> 00:51:22,140
pasture raised.
Um,

994
00:51:22,460 --> 00:51:24,470
so short answer,
uh,

995
00:51:24,830 --> 00:51:26,690
with grass fed beef,
uh,

996
00:51:26,900 --> 00:51:29,390
I just sent for him,
unfortunately,

997
00:51:29,391 --> 00:51:31,100
none of it was ready.
I was going to bring you some,

998
00:51:31,350 --> 00:51:32,620
uh,
uh,

999
00:51:32,660 --> 00:51:34,610
they just went in on Monday.
Uh

1000
00:51:34,970 --> 00:51:38,560
Oh would like to see him go through the
security checkpoint caring,

1001
00:51:38,570 --> 00:51:40,880
you know,
bags of beef with him.

1002
00:51:41,150 --> 00:51:41,983
But

1003
00:51:42,650 --> 00:51:47,060
26 so they were two years old and two
years old and two months or three

1004
00:51:47,061 --> 00:51:47,990
months.
Now,

1005
00:51:48,020 --> 00:51:50,170
what the incubation period that you were
discussing earlier,

1006
00:51:50,180 --> 00:51:53,900
you talking about a two year incubation
period with deer before they potentially

1007
00:51:53,901 --> 00:51:57,590
show any effects.
So these animals would fall into that

1008
00:51:57,591 --> 00:52:01,460
line between birth and slaughter,
that that would be inside that

1009
00:52:01,461 --> 00:52:04,190
incubation window for deer.
Um,

1010
00:52:04,280 --> 00:52:06,920
it could be potentially larger for cow.
Is that correct?

1011
00:52:07,010 --> 00:52:09,350
PSC,
I think the incubation period is between

1012
00:52:09,351 --> 00:52:12,470
three and five years.
And so that's why one of the

1013
00:52:12,471 --> 00:52:17,330
precautionary measures for BSC in the
United States is we don't allow those

1014
00:52:17,331 --> 00:52:20,210
older aged cattle into the human food
chain.

1015
00:52:20,240 --> 00:52:23,390
What does BSC stand for?
Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy,

1016
00:52:23,420 --> 00:52:25,920
Aka mad cow disease.
So,

1017
00:52:26,870 --> 00:52:30,470
so that's one of the precautionary
measures has not aligned cause to get

1018
00:52:30,471 --> 00:52:33,680
old co for mad cow disease.

1019
00:52:33,760 --> 00:52:35,350
Well,
and from my standpoint,

1020
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:37,990
they're prime at 26,
27 months.

1021
00:52:38,320 --> 00:52:42,280
And so when they are in an incubation
period,

1022
00:52:42,310 --> 00:52:45,490
they're still capable of distributing
the disease though.

1023
00:52:45,491 --> 00:52:46,324
Correct?

1024
00:52:46,580 --> 00:52:49,260
Well,
that's what cwd and with scrapey and

1025
00:52:49,261 --> 00:52:54,261
sheep as well with BSC and clarify,
if cwt went into a cow in a,

1026
00:52:55,861 --> 00:52:59,760
in a natural world,
we don't know exactly what it would look

1027
00:52:59,761 --> 00:53:01,770
like.
We know what it looks like when we

1028
00:53:01,771 --> 00:53:04,820
injected into the brain of account,
but we don't know what it would really

1029
00:53:04,830 --> 00:53:08,490
look like.
But BSE is quite different in that.

1030
00:53:08,990 --> 00:53:10,590
Um,
similarly with,

1031
00:53:10,650 --> 00:53:13,860
with the human prion diseases,
um,

1032
00:53:13,950 --> 00:53:16,740
uh,
an individual with Kourou could not give

1033
00:53:16,741 --> 00:53:20,100
Kourou to another human being.
They had to consume it.

1034
00:53:20,101 --> 00:53:23,250
So that with a verse,
that artificial process involved,

1035
00:53:23,430 --> 00:53:26,100
same thing with BSC cow.
A cow

1036
00:53:26,100 --> 00:53:30,390
would be s he can't give BSE to another
because they're not shedding that

1037
00:53:30,391 --> 00:53:32,520
infectious agent out into the
environment.

1038
00:53:32,590 --> 00:53:37,570
So when they stopped it,
when they stop feeding the cows,

1039
00:53:38,190 --> 00:53:42,650
that's called transmission cycle.
Cwd is a different animal.

1040
00:53:42,670 --> 00:53:47,670
So uwd and just our deputy Yazzie Times
10 on steroids,

1041
00:53:47,750 --> 00:53:50,330
while they're contagious,
kind of freaking me out a little bit

1042
00:53:50,331 --> 00:53:53,390
freaky because these animals are
shedding.

1043
00:53:53,750 --> 00:53:54,950
Okay.
Uh,

1044
00:53:54,960 --> 00:53:59,790
that infectious agent cows with BSE or
not shedding infectious agent cwd

1045
00:54:00,020 --> 00:54:05,020
positive deer and scrape the positive
sheep are these two diseases are unique

1046
00:54:05,150 --> 00:54:08,270
in the world of TSC.
TSC is a prion.

1047
00:54:08,271 --> 00:54:13,271
Diseases are unique amongst themselves,
but scrapey and cwd are in a different

1048
00:54:13,281 --> 00:54:17,490
world of their own.
So,

1049
00:54:17,600 --> 00:54:19,130
okay.
What,

1050
00:54:19,190 --> 00:54:21,050
if anything can be done?

1051
00:54:23,620 --> 00:54:28,620
Well,
I tried to break this stuff down to like

1052
00:54:29,630 --> 00:54:32,180
the most basic level.
So a guy like me can understand it.

1053
00:54:32,890 --> 00:54:35,940
MMM.
By time pay for science.

1054
00:54:36,300 --> 00:54:38,160
That's sort of one of the things slow
the,

1055
00:54:38,280 --> 00:54:42,510
this slow the spread of the disease.
There's a lot of work being done.

1056
00:54:43,030 --> 00:54:44,710
Um,
uh,

1057
00:54:45,010 --> 00:54:46,750
all kinds of studies being done,
um,

1058
00:54:46,870 --> 00:54:48,870
different organizations and,
and,

1059
00:54:48,910 --> 00:54:50,040
and the government.
Uh,

1060
00:54:50,050 --> 00:54:53,380
unfortunately in Wisconsin,
not as much as we should be doing where,

1061
00:54:53,500 --> 00:54:54,700
you know,
we're a hotbed of it.

1062
00:54:54,701 --> 00:54:56,680
I think that in Wisconsin,
quite honestly,

1063
00:54:56,681 --> 00:55:00,310
that we've become an example of how not
to handle the disease.

1064
00:55:00,700 --> 00:55:03,430
And a lot of the other states have begun
to,

1065
00:55:03,830 --> 00:55:05,210
uh,
you know,

1066
00:55:05,290 --> 00:55:07,390
uh,
take that idea that if you don't have

1067
00:55:07,391 --> 00:55:08,410
it,
you don't want it.

1068
00:55:08,800 --> 00:55:12,940
So let's do what we can to stop it from
coming here.

1069
00:55:13,060 --> 00:55:17,020
That's why you're seeing things like,
let's not transfer carcasses that,

1070
00:55:17,021 --> 00:55:18,850
you know,
there's bands on being able to transfer,

1071
00:55:18,940 --> 00:55:22,180
uh,
carcasses in Wisconsin and in some cases

1072
00:55:22,181 --> 00:55:26,140
you can't take it to another county.
You can take the finished meat so you

1073
00:55:26,141 --> 00:55:29,320
have to bone your meeting in the area
and then you can take it home.

1074
00:55:29,830 --> 00:55:31,250
Um,
which you know,

1075
00:55:31,251 --> 00:55:33,040
is a bit of a problem for,
you know,

1076
00:55:33,041 --> 00:55:34,660
for some folks,
um,

1077
00:55:35,500 --> 00:55:39,350
uh,
we're beginning to stop the movement of,

1078
00:55:39,530 --> 00:55:43,240
of captive deer from one farm to the
other.

1079
00:55:43,241 --> 00:55:46,870
But that's just recent and there have
been hearings on that lately,

1080
00:55:46,871 --> 00:55:47,704
so,
yeah.

1081
00:55:47,790 --> 00:55:49,380
So people resist that,
right?

1082
00:55:49,590 --> 00:55:50,970
Sure.
If your,

1083
00:55:51,210 --> 00:55:56,210
if your economic vita buy him a vitality
depends on selling and moving live deer,

1084
00:55:57,510 --> 00:56:01,140
you're going to be a post to
restrictions on your economic activity.

1085
00:56:01,141 --> 00:56:03,450
That is one of the primary infection
sources.

1086
00:56:03,480 --> 00:56:05,850
It's one of the infectious sources.
Yeah.

1087
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:11,000
So they will always correct you when you
say something like Doug Skating had

1088
00:56:11,130 --> 00:56:15,000
mobile,
like break it down.

1089
00:56:15,010 --> 00:56:18,150
So that's a world at 11.
So we'd think of,

1090
00:56:18,180 --> 00:56:21,150
there's appreciate,
there's two mechanisms,

1091
00:56:21,151 --> 00:56:24,820
primary mechanisms if we lump them for
how cwd moves.

1092
00:56:25,090 --> 00:56:26,590
One is dear to deer,
to deer,

1093
00:56:26,591 --> 00:56:31,270
to deer at slow diffusive process.
Neo moving out on the landscape that's

1094
00:56:31,271 --> 00:56:34,960
really hard to deal with.
The other one is this anthropogenic or

1095
00:56:34,961 --> 00:56:39,460
human assisted movement where humans are
moving infectious material and that

1096
00:56:39,461 --> 00:56:43,480
might be how it got from Colorado and
Wisconsin in the first place.

1097
00:56:43,750 --> 00:56:47,290
So highly unlikely that a mule deer,
whitetail deer got up,

1098
00:56:47,291 --> 00:56:51,300
woke up one morning in Colorado and
decided to go 900 miles,

1099
00:56:51,301 --> 00:56:53,650
cross the Mississippi River and settle
in,

1100
00:56:53,651 --> 00:56:55,090
you know,
western Dane County.

1101
00:56:55,120 --> 00:56:58,120
And back in the day,
my dad and a bunch of his buddies used

1102
00:56:58,121 --> 00:57:00,130
to go out to Colorado and they,
uh,

1103
00:57:00,310 --> 00:57:02,410
are Wyoming's actually where they went
and they hunted,

1104
00:57:02,610 --> 00:57:04,330
uh,
uh,

1105
00:57:04,690 --> 00:57:07,930
uh,
elk and mule deer and it ran the whole

1106
00:57:07,931 --> 00:57:09,730
damn thing back.
I mean,

1107
00:57:09,770 --> 00:57:10,780
just what you did,
right?

1108
00:57:10,781 --> 00:57:12,700
You put it on the back of the truck and
off you went.

1109
00:57:13,270 --> 00:57:16,970
And then a process,
I can remember doing it in the garage in

1110
00:57:16,971 --> 00:57:18,400
Cazenovia as a kid,
you know,

1111
00:57:18,401 --> 00:57:20,080
working there with knives.
This is a great thing.

1112
00:57:20,560 --> 00:57:22,210
Well what do you do with the bones and
the,

1113
00:57:22,990 --> 00:57:23,530
you know,
the,

1114
00:57:23,530 --> 00:57:26,320
the non meat stuff when you're done?
Well,

1115
00:57:26,620 --> 00:57:29,440
back in the day we used to and it still
happens,

1116
00:57:29,441 --> 00:57:32,510
we take it out and put it in a weed
called bone pile.

1117
00:57:32,530 --> 00:57:36,280
Coyote pile or something like that.
Dumped on the back 40 yeah.

1118
00:57:36,470 --> 00:57:37,350
Well where,
where

1119
00:57:37,800 --> 00:57:41,460
that's still could have infectivity if
it was a positive animal.

1120
00:57:42,060 --> 00:57:45,330
So it's a hospital out to Wisconsin is
who knows.

1121
00:57:45,331 --> 00:57:46,840
But anyway,
these are so he's,

1122
00:57:46,850 --> 00:57:51,180
he's absolutely correct.
The 25 states that don't have cwd don't

1123
00:57:51,181 --> 00:57:53,270
want to get it.
They want to do everything they can.

1124
00:57:53,271 --> 00:57:54,270
So these,
what is it?

1125
00:57:54,271 --> 00:57:58,170
Eastern states or southeastern states
and some of the far western states

1126
00:57:58,180 --> 00:58:00,160
haven't picked it up.
Oh yeah.

1127
00:58:00,270 --> 00:58:04,140
If you go to our website,
you'll see a map there that shows the

1128
00:58:04,141 --> 00:58:07,200
current known distribution of where the
disease is.

1129
00:58:07,380 --> 00:58:10,470
So the other states really don't want it
and they don't want it bad.

1130
00:58:10,471 --> 00:58:12,590
So it makes sense,
you know,

1131
00:58:12,600 --> 00:58:17,490
to look at these anthropogenic factors,
human assisted identify the possible

1132
00:58:17,491 --> 00:58:20,610
mechanisms,
how humans could bring cwd to him,

1133
00:58:20,970 --> 00:58:25,970
to you and stop them either with
regulatory frameworks or with education

1134
00:58:26,610 --> 00:58:30,630
teaching hunters that it's a risk to
move carcasses around is likely and much

1135
00:58:30,631 --> 00:58:33,750
more effective than just putting a rule
in place that says you can't.

1136
00:58:34,240 --> 00:58:39,240
And there are unscrupulous people who
purchase dear from these high fence

1137
00:58:39,281 --> 00:58:44,281
operations and release them in the wild
because they want big racks and animals

1138
00:58:44,501 --> 00:58:48,550
that it like people don't know there are
these high fence operations,

1139
00:58:48,800 --> 00:58:52,060
I shouldn't call them high fence
operations cause some of them are wild

1140
00:58:52,061 --> 00:58:54,550
animals that are contained in a fence.
These are farms,

1141
00:58:54,820 --> 00:58:58,660
there are farms that grow deer and they
grow dear with special protein feed.

1142
00:58:58,661 --> 00:59:03,661
So they have enormous racks.
So you have these really perverse specie

1143
00:59:06,400 --> 00:59:11,230
perverse examples of a deer and people
look at that and it like to,

1144
00:59:11,231 --> 00:59:15,310
to someone who enjoys wild animals,
you see those and you're like,

1145
00:59:15,370 --> 00:59:20,370
it's like a stripper with triple f test.
It's like what the fuck did you just do

1146
00:59:21,350 --> 00:59:23,750
like these?
They don't look real.

1147
00:59:23,930 --> 00:59:26,270
They don't like,
they have like 80 points.

1148
00:59:26,300 --> 00:59:28,310
Yeah.
Instead of like an eight point buck,

1149
00:59:28,311 --> 00:59:28,911
which is,
you know,

1150
00:59:28,911 --> 00:59:30,830
very typical or a 10 point buck.
You're like,

1151
00:59:30,831 --> 00:59:32,150
wow,
look at that monster.

1152
00:59:32,420 --> 00:59:34,640
That's a natural animal that lives in
the wild.

1153
00:59:34,790 --> 00:59:37,610
They have these things that they don't
even look like deer.

1154
00:59:37,611 --> 00:59:37,920
They look

1155
00:59:37,920 --> 00:59:40,680
like some,
some cartoon.

1156
00:59:42,620 --> 00:59:45,270
Like that stripper with the triple f
tits.

1157
00:59:45,271 --> 00:59:48,000
There are dudes or go,
I'm digging that.

1158
00:59:48,030 --> 00:59:49,110
Yeah.
But it's

1159
00:59:49,460 --> 00:59:54,130
vs to all who are in the know,
like you go over a guy's house and he

1160
00:59:54,131 --> 00:59:55,690
has one of those over his wall.
You're like,

1161
00:59:55,691 --> 00:59:58,510
did you just walk right out to that
thing and put a pistol in its head?

1162
00:59:58,511 --> 01:00:00,650
Like the deer hunter,
you know,

1163
01:00:00,651 --> 01:00:01,900
like what,
what is that?

1164
01:00:02,410 --> 01:00:05,770
That's not even an a wild animal.
That's some weird science project.

1165
01:00:07,060 --> 01:00:11,260
Well,
and genetics play a role in will correct

1166
01:00:11,261 --> 01:00:13,780
me when I start to veer off the science
thing here.

1167
01:00:13,781 --> 01:00:15,850
But um,
but uh,

1168
01:00:15,880 --> 01:00:17,710
genetics play a role in,
uh,

1169
01:00:17,880 --> 01:00:18,580
in,
in,

1170
01:00:18,580 --> 01:00:19,700
in bigger deer.
Yes.

1171
01:00:19,760 --> 01:00:21,070
And,
and your,

1172
01:00:21,150 --> 01:00:22,000
your friend,
uh,

1173
01:00:22,030 --> 01:00:24,730
John Dudley had say the number of,
he's doing it.

1174
01:00:24,731 --> 01:00:27,670
The number one way to get big antlered
deer as it's not let them grow.

1175
01:00:27,970 --> 01:00:30,340
Let them get old.
Let them get old and give them plenty of

1176
01:00:30,341 --> 01:00:31,030
food.
Yup.

1177
01:00:31,030 --> 01:00:33,220
Yeah.
But genetics have a role in it.

1178
01:00:33,221 --> 01:00:34,100
Two,
three,

1179
01:00:34,450 --> 01:00:37,300
three factors in production of antlers.
It's genetics,

1180
01:00:37,570 --> 01:00:41,140
age and nutrition.
I really the the key three there,

1181
01:00:41,740 --> 01:00:46,740
but now know a lot of places will
identify these as genetically superior.

1182
01:00:47,630 --> 01:00:51,220
Well that's kind of a misnomer when you
get back to the definition of fitness,

1183
01:00:51,221 --> 01:00:54,550
genetic fitness,
there's only one measure of genetic

1184
01:00:54,551 --> 01:00:58,930
fitness and that's how well represented
you are in the next generation.

1185
01:00:59,350 --> 01:01:02,170
Okay,
so let's take an example where we took

1186
01:01:02,171 --> 01:01:07,171
one of the cl 80 point whatever and
let's release it out into the wild.

1187
01:01:09,220 --> 01:01:12,570
And during breeding season it comes
across a prime,

1188
01:01:12,610 --> 01:01:14,680
three and a half or four and a half year
old.

1189
01:01:14,710 --> 01:01:16,110
Eight pointer.
Yeah.

1190
01:01:16,140 --> 01:01:18,780
This physical specimen that you've
witnessed him,

1191
01:01:18,781 --> 01:01:22,870
they're unbelievable.
So now if you put those up against each

1192
01:01:22,871 --> 01:01:27,871
other in a mortal battle,
I know who I'm putting mine my money on

1193
01:01:30,010 --> 01:01:31,630
the wild animal.
Absolutely.

1194
01:01:31,650 --> 01:01:32,400
Yeah,
for sure.

1195
01:01:32,400 --> 01:01:34,460
Every time.
And it's just so,

1196
01:01:34,461 --> 01:01:36,640
so these animals,
while they're bread,

1197
01:01:36,960 --> 01:01:39,190
uh,
very much like livestock for very

1198
01:01:39,191 --> 01:01:41,830
specific characteristics,
big antlers,

1199
01:01:42,280 --> 01:01:47,280
these don't necessarily translate into
something that would be more fit out in

1200
01:01:47,621 --> 01:01:48,170
the wall.

1201
01:01:48,170 --> 01:01:50,570
Well,
let's also point out that the reason why

1202
01:01:50,571 --> 01:01:52,820
you're bringing this up,
as these animals actually do fight to

1203
01:01:52,821 --> 01:01:55,590
the death and it happens all the time.
They kill each other in,

1204
01:01:55,591 --> 01:01:57,140
in combat.
That's the reason why they have those

1205
01:01:57,141 --> 01:01:59,480
antlers in the first pace.
They don't have them to protect

1206
01:01:59,481 --> 01:02:01,580
themselves against wolves like Caribou.
Do.

1207
01:02:01,581 --> 01:02:04,130
They literally have them to fight with,
you know,

1208
01:02:04,131 --> 01:02:07,400
female Caribou have antlers as well,
and they have these antlers so that they

1209
01:02:07,401 --> 01:02:10,130
could try to fend off animals that are
trying to eat them.

1210
01:02:10,160 --> 01:02:12,260
There's a big difference between that
and elk and deer.

1211
01:02:12,290 --> 01:02:15,170
They have them for combat.
That's why once the breeding season's

1212
01:02:15,171 --> 01:02:16,070
over,
they shed them.

1213
01:02:16,430 --> 01:02:18,110
Um,
and then they start all over again.

1214
01:02:18,200 --> 01:02:20,070
Yeah.
There's an interesting example.

1215
01:02:20,070 --> 01:02:22,460
If you look to history,
um,

1216
01:02:22,470 --> 01:02:25,560
it's an animal called the Irish elk.
That's things where they're,

1217
01:02:25,680 --> 01:02:27,720
they're extinct now.
Okay.

1218
01:02:27,721 --> 01:02:29,190
They were,
they were twice,

1219
01:02:29,191 --> 01:02:33,180
three times the size of our normal elk
in their antlers were measured in feet

1220
01:02:33,210 --> 01:02:34,920
instead of inches.
Okay.

1221
01:02:35,340 --> 01:02:40,340
And so during their evolutionary time
period when they were on the face of the

1222
01:02:40,351 --> 01:02:41,460
arts,
that was when he,

1223
01:02:41,461 --> 01:02:43,950
all animals were larger predators were
larger.

1224
01:02:44,190 --> 01:02:46,440
These things got Gargantuan.
Okay.

1225
01:02:46,620 --> 01:02:49,800
Then they disappeared from the landscape
and at least,

1226
01:02:49,801 --> 01:02:51,750
you know,
they offered author Stephen Jay Gould.

1227
01:02:51,770 --> 01:02:52,950
Yeah,
there you go.

1228
01:02:53,150 --> 01:02:58,150
I'm Stephen Jay Gould has offered up
that likely what occurred was a change

1229
01:02:59,551 --> 01:03:04,551
in the habitat that climate changed over
time and that forest grew up.

1230
01:03:05,400 --> 01:03:09,030
If you're in the plains and you have
antlers that are seven,

1231
01:03:09,040 --> 01:03:11,130
eight feet wide,
you can walk around.

1232
01:03:11,430 --> 01:03:16,200
But now when trees start to grow up,
how can you survive when the world

1233
01:03:16,201 --> 01:03:19,530
around you changed?
And you'd have to literally walk with

1234
01:03:19,531 --> 01:03:23,190
your head turned sideways and Irish
Schalchlin extinct.

1235
01:03:23,191 --> 01:03:26,310
So there's a very real example of how,
you know,

1236
01:03:26,330 --> 01:03:28,380
a,
a phenotypic characteristic.

1237
01:03:28,381 --> 01:03:31,750
These mega antlers.
Really in the longterm.

1238
01:03:31,890 --> 01:03:33,840
We're not in the best interest of the
species.

1239
01:03:33,950 --> 01:03:37,910
Jamie,
pull up a photograph of these farm deer

1240
01:03:37,911 --> 01:03:41,720
antlers just right.
Just type in google,

1241
01:03:41,721 --> 01:03:45,740
ridiculous farm deer antlers and you get
a sense of what we're talking about for

1242
01:03:45,741 --> 01:03:48,800
the people that are watching this on
youtube because until you see it you

1243
01:03:48,801 --> 01:03:51,290
don't really,
you don't understand how gross it's

1244
01:03:51,291 --> 01:03:51,990
gotten.
Yeah.

1245
01:03:51,990 --> 01:03:54,830
I think one was called Goliath that I
remember.

1246
01:03:54,890 --> 01:03:56,030
Well there's um,
the,

1247
01:03:56,080 --> 01:03:57,130
there,
there good go.

1248
01:03:57,180 --> 01:03:59,930
Perfect example.
That is a perfect example.

1249
01:04:00,080 --> 01:04:04,820
What in the fuck is that?
Because that's not a deer like that.

1250
01:04:04,821 --> 01:04:07,640
That thing is,
that's crazy what they've done to that

1251
01:04:07,641 --> 01:04:09,050
deer.
It's a product of selection.

1252
01:04:09,080 --> 01:04:12,410
Give breeding there specific
characteristics that some people will

1253
01:04:12,411 --> 01:04:13,430
pay a lot of money for.

1254
01:04:13,740 --> 01:04:15,990
Yeah.
And there's a certain high fence

1255
01:04:15,991 --> 01:04:18,990
operations that you can go online and
they they,

1256
01:04:19,260 --> 01:04:21,300
you know,
this is what like look,

1257
01:04:21,330 --> 01:04:24,450
go back to that photo you just had with
that guy standing there drawing.

1258
01:04:24,840 --> 01:04:26,090
Oh it's a drawing.
Yeah.

1259
01:04:26,660 --> 01:04:28,680
Duh.
You went to so quick.

1260
01:04:28,681 --> 01:04:30,390
I thought it was real.
Look at that thing.

1261
01:04:30,420 --> 01:04:32,900
I mean that is just insane.
Look at the one behind it though.

1262
01:04:33,180 --> 01:04:34,710
Very normal looking deer.
Yeah.

1263
01:04:34,890 --> 01:04:36,510
Yeah.
It's probably a one year old.

1264
01:04:37,490 --> 01:04:38,101
Yeah.
Yeah.

1265
01:04:38,101 --> 01:04:38,910
These,
uh,

1266
01:04:38,910 --> 01:04:41,820
this is,
there's these places that have these

1267
01:04:41,821 --> 01:04:46,480
animals and some people will take these
animals and then they import them to

1268
01:04:46,481 --> 01:04:48,150
purchase them,
import them,

1269
01:04:48,151 --> 01:04:51,120
and then release them into the air
quotes wild.

1270
01:04:51,480 --> 01:04:55,380
And then they'll hunt them.
And then they'll pretend that that's a

1271
01:04:55,381 --> 01:04:58,080
wild animal they shot.
And this is a,

1272
01:04:58,260 --> 01:05:00,300
this is a source of cw.

1273
01:05:01,270 --> 01:05:03,570
They are potentially,
well,

1274
01:05:03,700 --> 01:05:07,120
okay.
So deer has to have cwt in order to be a

1275
01:05:07,121 --> 01:05:07,954
risk.
Right.

1276
01:05:08,200 --> 01:05:09,550
So it's been shown,
I mean,

1277
01:05:09,551 --> 01:05:11,650
in the lower 48,
we're just,

1278
01:05:11,651 --> 01:05:15,700
I think we're at a hundred captive deer
and elk facilities that have been shown

1279
01:05:15,701 --> 01:05:17,870
to be cwd positive,
uh,

1280
01:05:17,910 --> 01:05:18,140
say

1281
01:05:18,140 --> 01:05:22,540
we can definitively identify that the
captive service industry has been a part

1282
01:05:22,541 --> 01:05:25,680
of moving cwd across the landscape.
Uh,

1283
01:05:25,860 --> 01:05:27,160
we know that,
you know,

1284
01:05:27,161 --> 01:05:28,490
cwt positive.
Do your,

1285
01:05:28,491 --> 01:05:30,940
have been moved by the industry even
across,

1286
01:05:30,941 --> 01:05:33,280
you know,
international and state lines.

1287
01:05:33,490 --> 01:05:35,980
Okay.
The ones in Korea are a great example.

1288
01:05:36,100 --> 01:05:38,620
Right.
And even we had a recent one where cewd

1289
01:05:38,621 --> 01:05:43,600
positive farm in Wisconsin that can do
trace backs where this animal came from.

1290
01:05:43,601 --> 01:05:46,780
It turned out it came from Pennsylvania,
a game farm in Pennsylvania,

1291
01:05:47,200 --> 01:05:50,950
and then a doing testing in that source
heard they found additional positives

1292
01:05:50,951 --> 01:05:54,250
there so definitively.
So now while that's me,

1293
01:05:54,340 --> 01:05:58,270
I'll say that very clearly.
The cwe or the captive industry is a

1294
01:05:58,271 --> 01:06:01,180
portion of the equation.
They're not the whole equation.

1295
01:06:01,330 --> 01:06:03,130
No,
they're not the whole equation.

1296
01:06:03,131 --> 01:06:04,750
So where did,
where did originate?

1297
01:06:04,960 --> 01:06:08,920
He said there were the first testing of
the positive testing of the stuff was,

1298
01:06:09,670 --> 01:06:14,670
it was first described in 1967 in a
research facility in the state of

1299
01:06:15,251 --> 01:06:16,084
Colorado.

1300
01:06:16,330 --> 01:06:18,640
Okay.
That's not to say that was the first

1301
01:06:18,730 --> 01:06:22,070
instance of cwd.
It was the first time it was described.

1302
01:06:22,350 --> 01:06:26,980
Mr. Chan dear farms.
Well I think dear farms have been around

1303
01:06:26,981 --> 01:06:28,120
for a long time.
There is,

1304
01:06:28,121 --> 01:06:29,470
if you Google,
you know,

1305
01:06:30,020 --> 01:06:32,780
tame dear,
you'll find some from the you with the

1306
01:06:32,800 --> 01:06:37,800
late 18 hundreds when photographs became
possible of a deer following people

1307
01:06:37,901 --> 01:06:41,260
around.
So we've domesticated animals for a

1308
01:06:41,261 --> 01:06:42,310
long,
long time.

1309
01:06:42,580 --> 01:06:46,340
But as an industry probably really came
into vogue in the,

1310
01:06:46,341 --> 01:06:48,550
you know,
maybe the sixties and seventies and more

1311
01:06:48,551 --> 01:06:50,140
recently now it's grown,
you know,

1312
01:06:50,141 --> 01:06:54,550
that industry has grown exponentially.
I used to work for Texas parks and law,

1313
01:06:54,551 --> 01:06:57,790
but before I worked for USG GS and,
uh,

1314
01:06:57,820 --> 01:07:02,050
one of the things I did was I
administered the deer breeding program

1315
01:07:02,051 --> 01:07:04,630
for the state.
So when I started this,

1316
01:07:05,230 --> 01:07:07,770
I didn't start the program,
but when I came into that,

1317
01:07:07,900 --> 01:07:12,900
that role there were administered a well
deer breeders in the state of Texas.

1318
01:07:13,170 --> 01:07:15,820
Oh.
Like many states need a permit from a

1319
01:07:15,821 --> 01:07:18,280
state agency to conduct those
activities.

1320
01:07:18,550 --> 01:07:22,030
Okay.
And so I was administrating that

1321
01:07:22,031 --> 01:07:26,160
program.
I think there are around 120 a licensed

1322
01:07:26,161 --> 01:07:29,140
to breeding facilities,
whitetail deer breeding facilities in

1323
01:07:29,141 --> 01:07:30,670
the state.
At that point in time,

1324
01:07:31,030 --> 01:07:33,760
you know,
10 years later when I left parks and

1325
01:07:33,761 --> 01:07:37,930
wildlife in Texas,
they're around six or 700 so it just

1326
01:07:37,931 --> 01:07:42,931
grew exponentially.
And now I believe they're there around a

1327
01:07:44,080 --> 01:07:47,020
thousand captive deer facilities in the
state of Texas,

1328
01:07:47,060 --> 01:07:48,730
cheeses,
Pennsylvania.

1329
01:07:48,731 --> 01:07:52,090
There's around a thousand of them.
Ohio's got several hundred,

1330
01:07:52,091 --> 01:07:54,780
Wisconsin's got a couple hundred.
So,

1331
01:07:55,050 --> 01:07:58,300
so I'd say they're part of the equation,
but I don't want to,

1332
01:07:58,301 --> 01:08:00,640
you know,
I don't want to place all the blame for

1333
01:08:00,641 --> 01:08:05,500
cwd moving it around because there's
other possibilities for how this disease

1334
01:08:05,560 --> 01:08:07,010
moves around.
Uh,

1335
01:08:07,060 --> 01:08:08,780
doug hit on a one of them.
Uh,

1336
01:08:08,920 --> 01:08:11,230
and that's the,
the idea of carcass movement.

1337
01:08:11,590 --> 01:08:14,870
It hasn't been proven that this occurs,
but it,

1338
01:08:15,950 --> 01:08:16,100
when

1339
01:08:16,100 --> 01:08:18,500
you look at it from a,
from a scientific standpoint,

1340
01:08:18,501 --> 01:08:21,230
it's very easy to identify.
So if,

1341
01:08:21,290 --> 01:08:22,010
if,
you know,

1342
01:08:22,010 --> 01:08:24,740
I butcher my own deer,
so if I kill a deer,

1343
01:08:24,741 --> 01:08:27,200
it happens to have cwd a butcher my own
dear,

1344
01:08:27,440 --> 01:08:29,810
I've got to do something with this
stuff.

1345
01:08:29,900 --> 01:08:31,040
Okay.
Um,

1346
01:08:31,070 --> 01:08:33,350
you know,
the meat component in a deer is probably

1347
01:08:33,351 --> 01:08:34,850
around 30,
35%,

1348
01:08:34,851 --> 01:08:36,890
something like that.
So I've got a lot of other stuff.

1349
01:08:37,460 --> 01:08:38,870
Landfills,
it turns out,

1350
01:08:38,871 --> 01:08:42,380
are very loathe to accept this material.
You know,

1351
01:08:42,400 --> 01:08:45,170
it's almost taboo.
Know who it might have cwd so we don't

1352
01:08:45,171 --> 01:08:48,410
want it at our landfill because the
effluent might be pumped out onto a

1353
01:08:48,411 --> 01:08:50,570
farmer's field and they could come back.
And you know,

1354
01:08:50,600 --> 01:08:54,390
they see it as a liability.
So I,

1355
01:08:54,530 --> 01:08:56,690
I've,
I've gotten my deer bones and,

1356
01:08:56,750 --> 01:09:01,220
and awful the rest of the material and I
drive to the dump,

1357
01:09:01,340 --> 01:09:03,470
which is 25 miles away.

1358
01:09:03,550 --> 01:09:04,310
I said,
no,

1359
01:09:04,310 --> 01:09:07,280
we're not taking that.
Well now what am I going to do with this

1360
01:09:07,281 --> 01:09:08,780
stuff?
So I could double bag it,

1361
01:09:08,900 --> 01:09:10,640
you know,
a little bit at a time and put it out in

1362
01:09:10,641 --> 01:09:11,900
the trash,
you know,

1363
01:09:12,320 --> 01:09:16,310
or maybe on the way home,
I'm driving past a state owned or state

1364
01:09:16,311 --> 01:09:19,100
park or a state natural area or a
wildlife management area,

1365
01:09:19,101 --> 01:09:23,700
and I see a trail go down there and I
drive down that trail and there's a pile

1366
01:09:23,701 --> 01:09:28,120
of deer bones and their heads here.
Whoops man.

1367
01:09:28,130 --> 01:09:30,040
Did I knocked that over?
Sorry about that Joe.

1368
01:09:33,330 --> 01:09:37,820
So it's easy to see how inadvertently

1369
01:09:38,350 --> 01:09:40,270
just hold your thought when you're not
on a microphone.

1370
01:09:40,520 --> 01:09:41,353
Just,
uh,

1371
01:09:42,340 --> 01:09:43,380
that's,
uh,

1372
01:09:44,140 --> 01:09:47,590
and it is one of the w one of the
concerns is how are we,

1373
01:09:47,620 --> 01:09:49,680
uh,
how,

1374
01:09:49,780 --> 01:09:52,420
what kind of hygiene do we have with the
carcasses?

1375
01:09:52,421 --> 01:09:55,950
So this is something that we're talking
about a lot more in Wisconsin now and

1376
01:09:55,951 --> 01:09:57,760
it,
and it's become an issue in one of the,

1377
01:09:58,120 --> 01:10:00,430
interestingly,
I'm the county deer advisory committee

1378
01:10:00,431 --> 01:10:02,290
for Richland County and we,
um,

1379
01:10:02,370 --> 01:10:05,890
it's a citizen group and we have some
say in,

1380
01:10:06,220 --> 01:10:08,110
um,
uh,

1381
01:10:08,140 --> 01:10:11,080
seasoned structure and then how many
antler this permits.

1382
01:10:11,081 --> 01:10:12,580
There are,
there's a lot of things we don't have

1383
01:10:12,581 --> 01:10:16,180
any say in which is fine.
I'd rather leave it to the biologists,

1384
01:10:16,181 --> 01:10:19,060
but because there are a hunter's
involved,

1385
01:10:19,390 --> 01:10:21,410
I'm happy to be one of them.
Um,

1386
01:10:22,270 --> 01:10:25,210
one of the things that happen in our
inner spring hearings is that we had

1387
01:10:25,211 --> 01:10:27,040
folks come in and say,
you know,

1388
01:10:27,041 --> 01:10:28,560
we're concerned about,
uh,

1389
01:10:28,750 --> 01:10:31,480
chronic wasting disease and we don't
want to spread it on the landscape,

1390
01:10:31,510 --> 01:10:33,970
but when we put the bones out on the
curb,

1391
01:10:34,270 --> 01:10:36,590
they aren't taking it on the,
uh,

1392
01:10:37,090 --> 01:10:41,590
Wisconsin Dnr cewd website.
There's a list of haulers who will take

1393
01:10:41,591 --> 01:10:43,390
it.
So there are some that will take it.

1394
01:10:44,080 --> 01:10:47,260
There are some who don't,
but my grandmas were they taking it?

1395
01:10:47,380 --> 01:10:49,360
Well,
they're taking it to clay lined,

1396
01:10:49,840 --> 01:10:52,930
um,
land landfills and

1397
01:10:54,520 --> 01:10:56,020
how it's being handled.
There's,

1398
01:10:56,050 --> 01:10:57,790
you know,
there's some question but it can be

1399
01:10:57,791 --> 01:11:00,400
isolated.
So the effluent isn't being taken out

1400
01:11:00,401 --> 01:11:01,900
and pumped out the fields.
It's something that you,

1401
01:11:01,950 --> 01:11:02,850
we can do something,
right?

1402
01:11:03,090 --> 01:11:04,380
Absolutely.
There's PR,

1403
01:11:04,440 --> 01:11:05,920
there's clear science.
So,

1404
01:11:06,140 --> 01:11:08,460
yeah.
And we noted how prions bind to various

1405
01:11:08,461 --> 01:11:11,010
surfaces.
They bind to clay particles very,

1406
01:11:11,011 --> 01:11:14,240
very tightly and say one of researchers
at Uwm,

1407
01:11:14,241 --> 01:11:16,300
Madison's name's Joel Patterson.
Yeah.

1408
01:11:16,360 --> 01:11:18,600
Tom was looking at this issue,
you know,

1409
01:11:18,601 --> 01:11:21,280
10 years ago to try and figure out is
can it be safe?

1410
01:11:21,281 --> 01:11:23,670
We'd done,
it turns out if you put about an eight

1411
01:11:23,671 --> 01:11:28,200
inch clay liner underneath Yale,
one portion of your landfill,

1412
01:11:28,470 --> 01:11:32,160
you can put all the deer and all the
prions there that you want to and allow

1413
01:11:32,161 --> 01:11:34,500
the preop,
this will then migrate down,

1414
01:11:34,610 --> 01:11:36,540
you know,
over time through the soil.

1415
01:11:36,780 --> 01:11:39,450
When they come in contact with a play
clay particles,

1416
01:11:39,510 --> 01:11:44,510
they bind and they don't go anywhere.
So it can be completely safely done.

1417
01:11:45,000 --> 01:11:49,620
So there's,
there's a way to dispose of these

1418
01:11:49,621 --> 01:11:51,420
materials very,
very safely.

1419
01:11:52,110 --> 01:11:53,310
But the,
the,

1420
01:11:53,470 --> 01:11:56,310
the thought of it,
the risk associated with it,

1421
01:11:56,311 --> 01:11:57,900
the liability,
some,

1422
01:11:57,901 --> 01:11:59,880
uh,
some landfill owners are just like,

1423
01:12:00,190 --> 01:12:01,620
Eh,
we'd rather not,

1424
01:12:02,370 --> 01:12:05,190
interestingly,
because we were challenged about this,

1425
01:12:05,280 --> 01:12:08,070
what are we supposed to do?
And you can incinerate it,

1426
01:12:08,460 --> 01:12:09,241
right?
Because they'll,

1427
01:12:09,241 --> 01:12:11,250
well,
it ends up being a budget issue in

1428
01:12:11,251 --> 01:12:12,840
Wisconsin.
Everything's a budget issue.

1429
01:12:12,841 --> 01:12:15,150
And the DNR is having,
you know,

1430
01:12:15,180 --> 01:12:17,070
issues with that.
And is something that I'd like to talk

1431
01:12:17,071 --> 01:12:17,904
about a little bit.
But,

1432
01:12:18,360 --> 01:12:19,950
um,
uh,

1433
01:12:20,370 --> 01:12:21,170
they were,
when,

1434
01:12:21,170 --> 01:12:23,280
when this all first happened,
uh,

1435
01:12:23,470 --> 01:12:26,360
in 17 years ago,
they were incinerating urine.

1436
01:12:26,510 --> 01:12:27,540
It became a,
you know,

1437
01:12:27,541 --> 01:12:28,980
a problem.
Um,

1438
01:12:29,490 --> 01:12:31,740
but there are,
uh,

1439
01:12:32,280 --> 01:12:35,100
landfills that are taking it and they're
our haulers who will take it.

1440
01:12:35,160 --> 01:12:37,890
They have dumpsters that they use
specifically for it.

1441
01:12:37,930 --> 01:12:39,650
They're aligned with,
uh,

1442
01:12:39,720 --> 01:12:42,320
you know,
heavy mil plastic that it's,

1443
01:12:42,330 --> 01:12:45,590
they're very specific to deer bones.
Um,

1444
01:12:46,500 --> 01:12:50,490
but some haulers aren't doing it.
So I contacted the head of a solid waste

1445
01:12:50,491 --> 01:12:52,830
for the state of Wisconsin and asked,
well,

1446
01:12:53,280 --> 01:12:55,590
how is this,
I go on your website and I see some take

1447
01:12:55,591 --> 01:12:56,424
it and some don't.

1448
01:12:56,610 --> 01:13:00,540
And her response was,
we have no legislative authority to

1449
01:13:00,541 --> 01:13:05,541
require them to take this.
So some are doing it voluntarily.

1450
01:13:05,920 --> 01:13:08,400
And actually one solid waste haulers
said to me,

1451
01:13:08,940 --> 01:13:10,020
um,
Geez,

1452
01:13:10,021 --> 01:13:12,050
we're putting a hell of a lot worse
stuff in the,

1453
01:13:12,450 --> 01:13:14,090
in the landfills then,
you know,

1454
01:13:14,100 --> 01:13:15,930
some deer bones.
Um,

1455
01:13:16,500 --> 01:13:17,071
but it's,
you know,

1456
01:13:17,071 --> 01:13:18,300
it's,
it's simple hygiene.

1457
01:13:18,301 --> 01:13:20,400
So one of the efforts that we're working
on in,

1458
01:13:20,470 --> 01:13:23,410
in southwest Wisconsin right now,
um,

1459
01:13:23,490 --> 01:13:25,800
is to,
and it's a funding issue,

1460
01:13:26,170 --> 01:13:29,850
um,
is to put place dumpsters in areas

1461
01:13:30,120 --> 01:13:31,850
where,
um,

1462
01:13:31,890 --> 01:13:34,110
you know,
like I'm volunteering to have one on my

1463
01:13:34,111 --> 01:13:36,030
farm.
It's a question of who's going to pay

1464
01:13:36,031 --> 01:13:37,590
for it.
And if it comes down to it,

1465
01:13:37,591 --> 01:13:41,040
I'm going to pay for the damn dumpster
on or about 500 bucks for a 20 yard

1466
01:13:41,041 --> 01:13:41,874
dumpster.
But,

1467
01:13:42,240 --> 01:13:43,500
um,
so that then,

1468
01:13:43,580 --> 01:13:44,580
you know,
people can come by,

1469
01:13:44,640 --> 01:13:46,620
throw their,
put their bones in that dumpster,

1470
01:13:46,860 --> 01:13:49,780
and then there'll be properly disposed
of because we have a,

1471
01:13:49,781 --> 01:13:53,580
a hauler near us who's said,
we're willing to bring them there.

1472
01:13:54,240 --> 01:13:55,073
Um,
uh,

1473
01:13:55,080 --> 01:13:56,430
you know,
to bring the dumpster there and then

1474
01:13:56,431 --> 01:13:58,740
dispose of the bones properly.
Like they do with,

1475
01:13:58,741 --> 01:14:00,200
uh,
uh,

1476
01:14:00,220 --> 01:14:00,780
at our,
uh,

1477
01:14:00,780 --> 01:14:03,270
and one of the lockers that one of the
butcher shops that,

1478
01:14:03,440 --> 01:14:04,400
you know,
processes deer,

1479
01:14:04,410 --> 01:14:07,500
they have the setup,
which is actually when I saw this when I

1480
01:14:07,501 --> 01:14:08,010
was like,
well wait,

1481
01:14:08,010 --> 01:14:09,650
why aren't we doing that in,
you know,

1482
01:14:09,710 --> 01:14:13,660
countywide and in various so that people
aren't chucking them in the ditch.

1483
01:14:15,010 --> 01:14:16,660
I mean,
otherwise you're holding onto the damn

1484
01:14:16,661 --> 01:14:18,760
bones until you find out whether the
things,

1485
01:14:18,820 --> 01:14:23,110
if you're,
if you're being completely careful about

1486
01:14:23,111 --> 01:14:24,280
the hygiene,
which we,

1487
01:14:24,610 --> 01:14:26,450
I've been trying to do and I'm telling
you,

1488
01:14:26,460 --> 01:14:30,160
you got a pile of bones in the old milk
house down there until you find out

1489
01:14:30,161 --> 01:14:33,850
whether it's positive or not.
And I'm literally keeping it the deer

1490
01:14:34,540 --> 01:14:39,540
bones separate so that when I find out
that deer a was non-positive well,

1491
01:14:40,050 --> 01:14:42,190
okay,
I can put those out or something like

1492
01:14:42,191 --> 01:14:43,024
that.

1493
01:14:43,120 --> 01:14:44,980
Um,
so that's one of the things,

1494
01:14:45,010 --> 01:14:46,840
there's a difference between what we
can,

1495
01:14:46,960 --> 01:14:49,990
we can,
there's natural spreading of the disease

1496
01:14:50,140 --> 01:14:53,770
and then there's human,
like putting them on trucks and move

1497
01:14:53,771 --> 01:14:57,010
them around or taking the bones around
and doing its carcass thing.

1498
01:14:57,011 --> 01:15:00,850
Is it really a low hanging fruit and the
idea that we can't fix this one,

1499
01:15:01,000 --> 01:15:02,650
I mean that's,
that's ridiculous.

1500
01:15:02,670 --> 01:15:03,503
And it's,
it's,

1501
01:15:03,710 --> 01:15:05,500
it's,
it's easy.

1502
01:15:05,501 --> 01:15:07,180
It seems easy to me.
I mean,

1503
01:15:07,181 --> 01:15:10,270
it's just a matter of will and money and
then,

1504
01:15:10,300 --> 01:15:12,530
and education obviously,
um,

1505
01:15:12,580 --> 01:15:14,920
that we're,
we're providing opportunity for this.

1506
01:15:16,120 --> 01:15:18,160
I've been working with the dnr a little
bit on this.

1507
01:15:18,161 --> 01:15:20,040
We're in some discussions about,
um,

1508
01:15:20,260 --> 01:15:24,370
two things.
One is a self service kiosk,

1509
01:15:24,371 --> 01:15:26,230
so to make getting,
uh,

1510
01:15:26,260 --> 01:15:29,560
getting your deer test that easier where
he wants to essentially cut the head off

1511
01:15:29,561 --> 01:15:32,880
the deer and leave it in a kiosk,
um,

1512
01:15:32,980 --> 01:15:34,630
with some information about where it
was.

1513
01:15:34,630 --> 01:15:35,081
And it's,
you know,

1514
01:15:35,081 --> 01:15:37,000
they're fairly simple.
They've been doing this for a couple of

1515
01:15:37,000 --> 01:15:39,450
years on an experimental basis.
Um,

1516
01:15:39,490 --> 01:15:40,620
but again,
it becomes a,

1517
01:15:40,840 --> 01:15:42,430
uh,
a budget issue.

1518
01:15:42,431 --> 01:15:45,490
So we're hoping that we're going to be
able to do is start something called

1519
01:15:45,650 --> 01:15:48,840
adopt a kiosk,
essentially that hunters and people who

1520
01:15:48,841 --> 01:15:49,990
are at sportsman's groups.
So,

1521
01:15:50,430 --> 01:15:52,410
um,
uh,

1522
01:15:53,260 --> 01:15:57,100
gather those heads and then take them
into the testing facility and therefore,

1523
01:15:57,580 --> 01:16:00,310
you know,
keep the budget money targeted at doing

1524
01:16:00,311 --> 01:16:05,311
the actual testing right next to that,
that a self service kiosk really should

1525
01:16:06,041 --> 01:16:11,041
be a dumpster that um,
you can throw your deer bones into

1526
01:16:11,231 --> 01:16:12,880
whether you know,
whether it's positive or not,

1527
01:16:12,910 --> 01:16:16,270
otherwise you are holding it.
The other thing that the dnr suggests

1528
01:16:16,271 --> 01:16:18,790
that we do is if you killed the deer on
your farm,

1529
01:16:19,210 --> 01:16:23,620
leave the bones on your farm.
Makes sense to me that way if it is

1530
01:16:23,621 --> 01:16:28,621
positive diseases already there and said
you're not taking his grand a chance at

1531
01:16:29,650 --> 01:16:32,800
moving it,
that's not an optimal solution to leave

1532
01:16:32,801 --> 01:16:34,930
that stuff on,
on the ground surface.

1533
01:16:35,350 --> 01:16:39,520
And an optimal solution is dig a hole.
But it's pretty hard to take sometimes

1534
01:16:39,521 --> 01:16:41,440
in December in Wisconsin.
Well,

1535
01:16:41,870 --> 01:16:42,703
if,
if I,

1536
01:16:42,730 --> 01:16:45,250
if the dumpsters thing doesn't end up
working out with me,

1537
01:16:45,251 --> 01:16:48,580
there will be a whole,
I mean last year we just kept the bone

1538
01:16:48,581 --> 01:16:50,680
separate and the,
and the ones that we,

1539
01:16:50,681 --> 01:16:51,990
uh,
I actually took the,

1540
01:16:52,060 --> 01:16:54,880
the,
the from the one deer was they went into

1541
01:16:54,881 --> 01:16:56,500
the,
the dumpster at the locker.

1542
01:16:57,190 --> 01:16:59,680
Um,
this all seems to me,

1543
01:16:59,980 --> 01:17:02,230
sorry to interrupt,
but this all seems to be like bandaids

1544
01:17:02,320 --> 01:17:04,780
on massive gunshot wounds.
It is.

1545
01:17:04,781 --> 01:17:08,830
But go back to what I was saying before.
Let's buy time,

1546
01:17:08,900 --> 01:17:09,733
right?
Cause this

1547
01:17:10,010 --> 01:17:10,970
shit's spreading,
man.

1548
01:17:11,000 --> 01:17:13,580
Yeah.
Let's buy time and pay for science.

1549
01:17:13,790 --> 01:17:15,890
Not Ah,
there's nothing we can do about it or

1550
01:17:15,891 --> 01:17:17,870
the other one that it's always been
here,

1551
01:17:17,960 --> 01:17:20,340
which I think the guitar player talked
about.

1552
01:17:20,480 --> 01:17:24,200
Is there any consideration whatsoever
that there could potentially be a cure?

1553
01:17:25,160 --> 01:17:26,840
Absolutely.
Absolutely.

1554
01:17:27,050 --> 01:17:28,490
See,
we hit on a couple of things.

1555
01:17:28,491 --> 01:17:32,810
I think it's important to talk just very
briefly about some paid generic disease

1556
01:17:32,811 --> 01:17:35,210
management practices.
Number one.

1557
01:17:35,211 --> 01:17:36,020
And I said,
beetle,

1558
01:17:36,020 --> 01:17:37,940
wildlife disease,
human disease,

1559
01:17:38,300 --> 01:17:40,340
livestock,
disease prevention,

1560
01:17:40,760 --> 01:17:42,080
number one,
if you don't have it,

1561
01:17:42,320 --> 01:17:43,670
don't get it.
Do everything you can.

1562
01:17:43,671 --> 01:17:45,620
That's why we get vaccinated.
Okay.

1563
01:17:45,621 --> 01:17:50,621
For various diseases if you do get to
see is do everything you can to keep

1564
01:17:50,931 --> 01:17:54,620
from moving it artificially.
So that's why we don't want to move the

1565
01:17:54,621 --> 01:17:56,840
carcasses around.
That's why you know we don't want to

1566
01:17:56,841 --> 01:17:58,000
move captive deer or not.

1567
01:17:58,280 --> 01:18:03,280
That's why we went when we had an ebola
outbreak in 2015 in Liberia and Ivory

1568
01:18:03,980 --> 01:18:06,950
Coast,
we stopped commercial airline flights.

1569
01:18:07,340 --> 01:18:09,860
We didn't want people inadvertently
moving it up.

1570
01:18:10,250 --> 01:18:12,500
So prevent,
don't move it around.

1571
01:18:13,070 --> 01:18:17,870
Conduct surveillance around areas where
it is to see what's going on in states

1572
01:18:17,871 --> 01:18:20,180
are doing that very well.
Largely.

1573
01:18:20,660 --> 01:18:24,210
The next one is a tough one.
Do something about disease manage

1574
01:18:24,211 --> 01:18:27,920
disease to try and knock down prevalence
incidence and get rid of the disease.

1575
01:18:28,580 --> 01:18:32,300
So that's challenging.
But two other things.

1576
01:18:32,660 --> 01:18:35,900
Number one is support research because
if we don't have a cure today,

1577
01:18:35,990 --> 01:18:39,350
we won't have one tomorrow either.
How is resorts funded right now?

1578
01:18:40,310 --> 01:18:43,880
Either by states or by the federal
government and there's not a ton of

1579
01:18:43,881 --> 01:18:46,670
money.
The last one is being transparent with

1580
01:18:46,671 --> 01:18:49,310
your stakeholders.
Being open and communicative with them.

1581
01:18:49,850 --> 01:18:54,500
So it's with many diseases.
We have good therapeutics,

1582
01:18:54,700 --> 01:18:58,670
okay,
we can treat some diseases cwd and other

1583
01:18:58,671 --> 01:18:59,570
prion diseases.

1584
01:18:59,570 --> 01:19:02,510
We have no therapeutics,
we have no treatments right now,

1585
01:19:03,050 --> 01:19:05,150
but people are certainly working towards
him.

1586
01:19:05,151 --> 01:19:09,290
That's so likely it's going to be very
challenging to create a therapeutic,

1587
01:19:09,291 --> 01:19:13,850
something that treats a prion disease
because treatment would then mean you

1588
01:19:13,851 --> 01:19:16,400
would have to get past the blood brain
barrier.

1589
01:19:16,790 --> 01:19:21,080
And once you start this cascading
interaction of normal prion to disease

1590
01:19:21,081 --> 01:19:23,510
associated preamps in the central
nervous system,

1591
01:19:23,780 --> 01:19:26,540
it's going to be really,
really challenging to stop that.

1592
01:19:26,690 --> 01:19:27,411
I mean,
it's a,

1593
01:19:27,411 --> 01:19:30,980
it's a roller coaster gone awry by the
time it gets up into the brain.

1594
01:19:31,610 --> 01:19:33,710
So then you're looking at preventative
measures,

1595
01:19:33,830 --> 01:19:38,830
the idea of vaccines as number one.
And number two is looking at animals

1596
01:19:39,231 --> 01:19:43,340
that through their genetic profile are
resistant to disease.

1597
01:19:43,790 --> 01:19:48,790
And there's some advances on each front.
So we can talk about vaccines for a

1598
01:19:49,491 --> 01:19:50,370
moment.
Um,

1599
01:19:50,420 --> 01:19:53,690
so people,
individual scientist's research outfits

1600
01:19:53,691 --> 01:19:57,040
have been trying to develop vaccines for
tss,

1601
01:19:57,050 --> 01:19:59,390
for prion diseases for a long time.

1602
01:19:59,710 --> 01:20:01,940
Okay.
None have been successful.

1603
01:20:01,941 --> 01:20:04,880
There's no,
there's no human prion disease vaccines.

1604
01:20:04,881 --> 01:20:06,740
There's nothing for BSC.
There's nothing for,

1605
01:20:07,680 --> 01:20:11,010
but there's research ongoing and there
have been some advances.

1606
01:20:11,580 --> 01:20:16,080
There is a Canadian research group that
had a vaccine candidate for cwd.

1607
01:20:16,470 --> 01:20:19,170
They thought it looked very promising.
So I went to a field,

1608
01:20:19,310 --> 01:20:22,800
a production stage,
and I actually tried deploying this

1609
01:20:22,801 --> 01:20:25,920
vaccine in a captive facility in
Wyoming.

1610
01:20:26,200 --> 01:20:30,420
Can I research facility?
It turned out that this vaccine was not

1611
01:20:30,421 --> 01:20:32,310
ready for prime time.
And actually after,

1612
01:20:32,670 --> 01:20:35,910
after a,
I'm giving this vaccine to some elk,

1613
01:20:36,030 --> 01:20:40,850
giving a placebo facebow to other elk
and then leaving him in a conceit obd

1614
01:20:40,860 --> 01:20:45,210
contaminated facility.
Actually the vaccinated animals got cwd

1615
01:20:45,211 --> 01:20:49,020
faster and at a higher rate than the non
vaccinated animals.

1616
01:20:49,080 --> 01:20:51,450
So it turned out to be almost an anti
vaccine.

1617
01:20:51,780 --> 01:20:52,830
Okay.
So it didn't work.

1618
01:20:53,050 --> 01:20:53,660
So

1619
01:20:53,660 --> 01:20:57,020
being an earth,
there was some sort of active cwd in the

1620
01:20:57,021 --> 01:20:57,530
vaccine.

1621
01:20:57,530 --> 01:20:58,370
Is that what it is?
No,

1622
01:20:58,580 --> 01:21:00,470
it just,
for whatever reason,

1623
01:21:00,500 --> 01:21:03,290
it that exceed supposed it predisposed
the animals.

1624
01:21:03,800 --> 01:21:06,050
So it,
it was a massive failure.

1625
01:21:06,200 --> 01:21:08,180
But even from failure,
you learn,

1626
01:21:08,660 --> 01:21:10,920
okay,
so they're working now in base,

1627
01:21:10,940 --> 01:21:13,100
you know,
they learned a lot in that experiment.

1628
01:21:13,850 --> 01:21:17,150
There's another research group centered
out of the university in New York who

1629
01:21:17,151 --> 01:21:21,410
published a paper,
I think in 2015 was her most recent

1630
01:21:21,411 --> 01:21:25,160
work.
And they've got a vaccine candidate that

1631
01:21:25,161 --> 01:21:28,280
provides some degree of protection,
quote unquote,

1632
01:21:28,281 --> 01:21:32,720
protection from disease.
Now all but one of the animals that they

1633
01:21:32,721 --> 01:21:37,070
gave this vaccine to and then challenged
with cwt got cwd.

1634
01:21:37,340 --> 01:21:38,780
Okay,
so that's not good news.

1635
01:21:39,320 --> 01:21:42,740
But the average incubation time was
extended.

1636
01:21:43,100 --> 01:21:45,530
That's something like 300 days.
Okay.

1637
01:21:45,531 --> 01:21:49,940
So they're on the right track.
They have a mechanism that is somehow

1638
01:21:49,970 --> 01:21:54,970
interfering with the conversion from
normal host prion protein to the disease

1639
01:21:54,991 --> 01:21:57,680
associated form.
So very valuable.

1640
01:21:58,070 --> 01:22:01,490
Now will they get there?
We don't know so,

1641
01:22:01,690 --> 01:22:05,330
but think about it.
Even if we do create a vaccine that

1642
01:22:05,390 --> 01:22:09,230
works,
that prevents cwd and prevent as opposed

1643
01:22:09,231 --> 01:22:11,600
to slowing,
there's a very big distinction.

1644
01:22:12,110 --> 01:22:15,890
So if you have a vaccine that makes the
average course of disease three years

1645
01:22:15,891 --> 01:22:18,560
instead of two years or four years
instead of two years,

1646
01:22:19,310 --> 01:22:21,630
they still have cwd are there.
Okay.

1647
01:22:21,790 --> 01:22:26,790
Dear farms that have 100% negative cwd
deer and them like none of them test

1648
01:22:29,021 --> 01:22:29,854
positive,
right?

1649
01:22:30,240 --> 01:22:34,170
The vast majority of dairy farms have
never had cwd the vast majority.

1650
01:22:34,340 --> 01:22:35,173
Absolutely.

1651
01:22:35,290 --> 01:22:40,290
There is a potential that you could
isolate these populations of completely

1652
01:22:42,251 --> 01:22:46,900
cwd free deer,
and if there's some sort of a mass die

1653
01:22:46,901 --> 01:22:49,630
off,
you could reintroduce these deer into

1654
01:22:49,631 --> 01:22:50,464
the wild.

1655
01:22:50,720 --> 01:22:51,261
Well,
okay,

1656
01:22:51,261 --> 01:22:52,550
so you're,
again,

1657
01:22:52,551 --> 01:22:54,610
you're,
you're looking at a giant,

1658
01:22:55,480 --> 01:23:00,410
you're looking at the difference there
between a herd that is cwd free,

1659
01:23:00,530 --> 01:23:05,530
which means it likely hasn't been
exposed to cwd versus animals are cwd

1660
01:23:05,980 --> 01:23:08,870
resistant through genetics.
Right?

1661
01:23:09,640 --> 01:23:14,110
So today we have,
we have not seen any deer that are

1662
01:23:14,111 --> 01:23:18,820
genetically completely resistant.
There are different genotypes of the

1663
01:23:18,821 --> 01:23:23,821
prion protein gene out there that do
impact the length of disease and also

1664
01:23:25,271 --> 01:23:29,860
seem to have some impact on how often
the frequency that these animals get

1665
01:23:29,890 --> 01:23:34,450
disease.
But even the genetically resistant deer

1666
01:23:34,930 --> 01:23:38,080
do get cwd.
Okay.

1667
01:23:38,350 --> 01:23:40,660
They get admitted,
they get it at a lower rate,

1668
01:23:40,690 --> 01:23:43,570
they likely transmit it,
they're likely shedding infectious

1669
01:23:43,571 --> 01:23:45,220
agent.
So instead of that,

1670
01:23:45,340 --> 01:23:49,120
that kind of garden variety,
two year incubation period,

1671
01:23:49,720 --> 01:23:52,420
it might be closer to a five year
incubation period.

1672
01:23:52,720 --> 01:23:55,960
So now for on the one hand you're gone
great.

1673
01:23:55,960 --> 01:23:58,240
Most deer die before they're five years
old anyway,

1674
01:23:58,241 --> 01:24:01,810
so this would be a good thing.
But on the downside,

1675
01:24:02,260 --> 01:24:06,730
you're talking about a population of
animals that have cwd with all these

1676
01:24:06,731 --> 01:24:09,640
other side effects.
They're shedding infectious agent out

1677
01:24:09,641 --> 01:24:10,830
into the environment,
this,

1678
01:24:10,831 --> 01:24:13,670
that and the other and you know,
cause a,

1679
01:24:14,130 --> 01:24:18,940
a potential risk to human and other,
other health impacts on the landscape.

1680
01:24:19,510 --> 01:24:22,450
So I'm not so certain that this is uh,
a success story,

1681
01:24:22,451 --> 01:24:26,830
just like a,
a vaccine that results in a longer

1682
01:24:26,831 --> 01:24:31,510
course of disease where there are deer
can get cwd but they die from something

1683
01:24:31,511 --> 01:24:33,460
else.
A population of,

1684
01:24:33,480 --> 01:24:37,630
of resistant animals that have as a high
prevalence of cwd.

1685
01:24:37,960 --> 01:24:41,680
I guess I don't see that it's a
desirable end point because of the other

1686
01:24:41,830 --> 01:24:45,790
consequences and potential repercussions
must be more desirable for killed him

1687
01:24:45,791 --> 01:24:49,060
instantly.
A shorter incubation period would be

1688
01:24:49,270 --> 01:24:50,040
preferable.

1689
01:24:50,040 --> 01:24:51,380
Yeah.
Because then you have the,

1690
01:24:51,390 --> 01:24:55,220
I mean it's almost like engineering deer
to survive longer,

1691
01:24:55,260 --> 01:24:56,790
gives them more potential to spread it

1692
01:24:57,230 --> 01:24:59,670
absolutely sit down.
Um,

1693
01:24:59,990 --> 01:25:02,420
recently sent out there,
there's claims that,

1694
01:25:02,510 --> 01:25:04,580
and there's research going on in some of
the,

1695
01:25:04,750 --> 01:25:09,290
at farms to dear farms that they've
identified genetic markers,

1696
01:25:09,410 --> 01:25:13,160
ones that are not published in the
literature yet that are affording a

1697
01:25:13,161 --> 01:25:15,710
higher degree of protection from
disease.

1698
01:25:16,130 --> 01:25:19,850
But until it's published in the peer
reviewed literature and really tested

1699
01:25:20,330 --> 01:25:21,163
it,
it's,

1700
01:25:21,500 --> 01:25:23,870
it's a speaking point until that point
in time.

1701
01:25:24,170 --> 01:25:25,730
So we don't know if they'll get there.

1702
01:25:26,090 --> 01:25:30,260
We've got to put a fence around
Wisconsin dog giant one 30 feet high.

1703
01:25:30,440 --> 01:25:31,071
Well,
it's,

1704
01:25:31,071 --> 01:25:32,100
you know,
there's 30 feet.

1705
01:25:32,550 --> 01:25:35,490
The Northern Illinois,
no northeast style.

1706
01:25:36,440 --> 01:25:39,280
All the places that have it.
25 but so what happened?

1707
01:25:39,290 --> 01:25:42,680
Half Alaska doesn't,
does Alaska have it?

1708
01:25:42,860 --> 01:25:44,090
Not that we know.
No.

1709
01:25:44,120 --> 01:25:45,350
Hawaii,
no.

1710
01:25:45,440 --> 01:25:46,273
No.
Okay.

1711
01:25:46,490 --> 01:25:50,660
So lower 48,
25 it's more than 50% then more than 50%

1712
01:25:50,661 --> 01:25:52,490
of the states have it.
Wow.

1713
01:25:53,270 --> 01:25:54,720
25 out of 48.
Yep.

1714
01:25:54,950 --> 01:25:58,970
So this is something that it just can't
be dismissed.

1715
01:25:59,060 --> 01:26:01,310
This is not,
this is not something that's a hoax.

1716
01:26:01,311 --> 01:26:04,150
This is not.
So the reason people were upset,

1717
01:26:04,150 --> 01:26:04,820
it would,
uh,

1718
01:26:04,820 --> 01:26:07,970
Ted said on the podcast,
there's very good reason.

1719
01:26:08,300 --> 01:26:08,990
Well,
look,

1720
01:26:08,990 --> 01:26:10,020
if I want to,
yeah,

1721
01:26:10,030 --> 01:26:14,660
I play guitar and a fine.
Want to learn some kickass Detroit

1722
01:26:14,660 --> 01:26:16,310
Guitar riffs.
I'm going to listen to Ted nugent.

1723
01:26:16,610 --> 01:26:18,950
If I want to learn about cwd,
I'm gonna listen to [inaudible] in

1724
01:26:19,000 --> 01:26:19,970
Richardson.
Guys like him.

1725
01:26:20,050 --> 01:26:20,571
Well,
the thing is,

1726
01:26:20,571 --> 01:26:23,990
ted does know a lot about hunting and he
knows a lot of wildlife.

1727
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:25,820
You know,
it's a lot about conservation,

1728
01:26:25,850 --> 01:26:27,590
but it appears that he's,
uh,

1729
01:26:27,740 --> 01:26:29,860
very misinformed or under informed.

1730
01:26:30,740 --> 01:26:34,690
Let me try and put this in perspective.
Okay.

1731
01:26:34,691 --> 01:26:38,470
So you have a disease which is
contagious,

1732
01:26:39,220 --> 01:26:41,850
so always fatal upon close clinical,
always invitation,

1733
01:26:42,260 --> 01:26:46,000
a hundred percent fatal deer don't
survive if humans don't survive prion

1734
01:26:46,001 --> 01:26:47,860
diseases.
When it enters the central nervous

1735
01:26:47,861 --> 01:26:49,750
system,
it's a death sentence.

1736
01:26:50,230 --> 01:26:52,600
Okay?
So it's contagious.

1737
01:26:53,290 --> 01:26:55,360
It's fatal.
Neurodegenerative disorder,

1738
01:26:55,361 --> 01:26:57,790
it's gotta be a horrible way to die.
Okay?

1739
01:26:58,180 --> 01:27:02,620
So that's a pretty significant set of
clinical signs or symptoms in an

1740
01:27:02,621 --> 01:27:03,730
individual animal.
Right?

1741
01:27:03,820 --> 01:27:07,360
Okay.
Now let's look at the geographic spread.

1742
01:27:07,420 --> 01:27:11,140
Rampid geographic spread.
So it has an ever expanding geographic

1743
01:27:11,141 --> 01:27:15,160
footprint in areas where it's,
it's been known the longest.

1744
01:27:15,161 --> 01:27:17,860
We now have prevalence in a cohort of
animals,

1745
01:27:17,861 --> 01:27:21,880
adult male,
so around 50% and in adult females

1746
01:27:21,910 --> 01:27:26,860
around 30%.
Can you name any other disease of

1747
01:27:26,861 --> 01:27:28,150
humans,
fish,

1748
01:27:28,151 --> 01:27:30,040
domestic livestock,
dogs,

1749
01:27:30,041 --> 01:27:33,550
wildlife,
anything else that has that set of

1750
01:27:33,551 --> 01:27:38,050
characteristics and that degree of
penetrants into the population and you

1751
01:27:38,051 --> 01:27:40,360
go,
that's no big deal.

1752
01:27:42,010 --> 01:27:44,320
Um,
I'm not aware of one.

1753
01:27:44,440 --> 01:27:47,140
There was a one.
Now this is obviously very,

1754
01:27:47,141 --> 01:27:49,090
very significant,
which is one of the reasons why I wanted

1755
01:27:49,091 --> 01:27:53,320
to have you guys off.
I wanted to ask Jamie to pull up some

1756
01:27:53,321 --> 01:27:56,800
photos of,
of clinical cwd deer or elk.

1757
01:27:56,980 --> 01:27:59,980
I think you had something and then you
kind of took him down photos of the ones

1758
01:27:59,981 --> 01:28:01,630
that are sick.
That,

1759
01:28:02,710 --> 01:28:06,640
so again,
24 month plus or minus a incubation

1760
01:28:06,641 --> 01:28:08,710
period in the last six to eight weeks or
clinical.

1761
01:28:09,190 --> 01:28:10,690
Um,
I,

1762
01:28:11,110 --> 01:28:12,010
you know,
I gotta tell you,

1763
01:28:12,011 --> 01:28:13,120
man,
I killed this dear,

1764
01:28:13,590 --> 01:28:15,580
uh,
anti tested positive.

1765
01:28:16,710 --> 01:28:20,700
Yeah.
Tested positive in the office.

1766
01:28:20,810 --> 01:28:25,670
That one's not cewd.
That's not the one before that one.

1767
01:28:25,671 --> 01:28:27,200
What is that Scott?
Some of that was called,

1768
01:28:27,201 --> 01:28:29,730
that's a cutaneous fibromas.
Uh,

1769
01:28:29,740 --> 01:28:32,330
there are tumors that grow on the
surface of the skin.

1770
01:28:32,990 --> 01:28:35,150
Pretty grotesque looking.
Those are that,

1771
01:28:35,680 --> 01:28:36,800
um,
it's a virus.

1772
01:28:37,190 --> 01:28:40,670
It's,
well,

1773
01:28:40,671 --> 01:28:44,270
if you get those awards and those
fibromas on your eyes and they block

1774
01:28:44,271 --> 01:28:45,620
your vision,
it would be,

1775
01:28:45,860 --> 01:28:48,560
but otherwise it's about,
it's a stressor on animals and you can

1776
01:28:48,561 --> 01:28:49,760
actually eat down there.
Fine.

1777
01:28:49,790 --> 01:28:50,623
But I don't think

1778
01:28:51,470 --> 01:28:54,530
chronic wasting disease that Jamie's got
up there,

1779
01:28:54,531 --> 01:28:56,690
the larger image,
scroll down what it is that,

1780
01:28:56,691 --> 01:28:57,220
um,

1781
01:28:57,220 --> 01:28:58,750
that's likely cwd.
Yes,

1782
01:28:58,780 --> 01:29:01,800
absolutely.
Pick the one that's on the row

1783
01:29:01,801 --> 01:29:02,370
underneath

1784
01:29:02,370 --> 01:29:07,370
the second one from the left.
That one that the buck there.

1785
01:29:08,650 --> 01:29:09,630
That's,
yeah,

1786
01:29:09,631 --> 01:29:11,130
that's,
that's a photograph.

1787
01:29:11,180 --> 01:29:13,110
No,
you had on there.

1788
01:29:13,320 --> 01:29:16,220
So that was taken by a game warden.
Um,

1789
01:29:16,590 --> 01:29:20,160
Michael A.
Hopper is his name was in the state of

1790
01:29:20,161 --> 01:29:22,920
Kansas and he's,
you know,

1791
01:29:22,921 --> 01:29:27,540
this diseases has a pretty decent
footprint in Kansas as a game warden.

1792
01:29:28,420 --> 01:29:33,420
He had gets calls about deer acting
funny and so he's taken a number of good

1793
01:29:34,531 --> 01:29:37,320
pictures.
If you can zoom in on that photo,

1794
01:29:37,350 --> 01:29:40,290
I don't know if you can look at what's
coming out of that.

1795
01:29:40,291 --> 01:29:45,291
Deer is mouth.
See that stream of saliva that's all

1796
01:29:45,811 --> 01:29:49,560
filled with infectious material.
So that's one of the clinical signs is

1797
01:29:49,561 --> 01:29:51,470
it's hypersalivation well,
deer,

1798
01:29:51,690 --> 01:29:55,790
that's a wild deer.
So it's almost like this disease's

1799
01:29:55,800 --> 01:29:59,130
trying to spread itself.
It's been pretty efficient.

1800
01:29:59,190 --> 01:29:59,941
Yeah,
yeah.

1801
01:29:59,941 --> 01:30:01,290
But,
but by doing that,

1802
01:30:01,291 --> 01:30:05,820
by forcing these animals to have all the
saliva excretion,

1803
01:30:06,390 --> 01:30:09,930
this is a very effective means of
transmitting this disease throughout

1804
01:30:09,931 --> 01:30:13,320
the,
the set of characteristics of this whole

1805
01:30:13,321 --> 01:30:17,810
disease where the protracted incubation
period shedding infectious agents

1806
01:30:17,811 --> 01:30:21,180
through bodily fluids for the majority
of that incubation period,

1807
01:30:21,600 --> 01:30:22,291
the,
uh,

1808
01:30:22,291 --> 01:30:26,190
the infectious agent persistently
environment for years out to decades.

1809
01:30:26,190 --> 01:30:28,110
I mean,
if you wanted to stack the deck for

1810
01:30:28,111 --> 01:30:30,060
disease,
you couldn't come up with a better set

1811
01:30:30,061 --> 01:30:33,390
of characteristics.
Plus they look perfectly healthy.

1812
01:30:33,391 --> 01:30:36,030
So we have no idea.
You know,

1813
01:30:36,060 --> 01:30:39,060
that they're there that are diseased
until later on in,

1814
01:30:39,110 --> 01:30:40,860
in,
in the disease progression.

1815
01:30:40,950 --> 01:30:45,950
Now is there a prevalence in or is there
a higher prevalence in deer versus moose

1816
01:30:46,711 --> 01:30:51,711
versus a elk or anything else?
We tend to see higher prevalence in the

1817
01:30:51,901 --> 01:30:55,740
deer species,
whitetail deer mule deer in isolated

1818
01:30:55,741 --> 01:30:59,610
areas.
Then we do in either elk moose,

1819
01:30:59,611 --> 01:31:01,140
there's only been,
you know,

1820
01:31:01,141 --> 01:31:04,140
worldwide,
there may be only been 10 positive moose

1821
01:31:04,440 --> 01:31:05,490
okay.
To date.

1822
01:31:06,030 --> 01:31:08,250
And it's likely in a,
and it doesn't seem that they're less

1823
01:31:08,251 --> 01:31:10,500
susceptible,
it's just that they're likely haven't

1824
01:31:10,501 --> 01:31:13,950
been exposed because they're not in the
same systems.

1825
01:31:14,070 --> 01:31:17,850
And there are moose tend to be a
solitary,

1826
01:31:17,910 --> 01:31:20,470
solitary,
definitely Wisconsin,

1827
01:31:22,890 --> 01:31:26,010
you know,
periodically a single a yearling,

1828
01:31:26,011 --> 01:31:29,040
we'll,
we'll wander down from a northeastern

1829
01:31:29,041 --> 01:31:30,330
part of Minnesota,
but very,

1830
01:31:30,331 --> 01:31:31,800
very rare.
What about wolves?

1831
01:31:31,860 --> 01:31:35,700
Have Wolves contracted it yet?
Wolves are interesting story.

1832
01:31:35,760 --> 01:31:37,030
So,
um,

1833
01:31:37,710 --> 01:31:40,620
to date,
there's no evidence that any Canaan,

1834
01:31:40,650 --> 01:31:44,850
any member of the dog family has ever
developed any TSC.

1835
01:31:45,000 --> 01:31:48,040
They never got bse as far as we know.
Uh,

1836
01:31:48,060 --> 01:31:50,640
no evidence at any Canaan has gotten
cwd.

1837
01:31:51,030 --> 01:31:56,030
Now that could be a real observation.
It could also be that we haven't done

1838
01:31:56,161 --> 01:31:57,750
enough science on it.
Okay.

1839
01:31:57,780 --> 01:32:00,640
But there's certainly exposure as
opposed to cats.

1840
01:32:01,090 --> 01:32:03,430
Um,
in the BSE situation,

1841
01:32:03,431 --> 01:32:07,630
both great cats and domestic cats got a
TLC.

1842
01:32:07,690 --> 01:32:10,000
We,
it was referred to as feline spongiform

1843
01:32:10,001 --> 01:32:14,350
encephalopathy and it was from consuming
BSE contaminated meat.

1844
01:32:14,560 --> 01:32:17,050
Okay.
Very similar to how he wasn't mountain

1845
01:32:17,051 --> 01:32:17,660
lions.
Yeah.

1846
01:32:17,660 --> 01:32:19,540
Great cats,
which most certainly consumed.

1847
01:32:19,800 --> 01:32:21,520
Yeah.
Regular basis.

1848
01:32:21,550 --> 01:32:24,010
Now in,
in with cwt in North America,

1849
01:32:24,011 --> 01:32:24,491
we,
again,

1850
01:32:24,491 --> 01:32:28,210
we have no evidence at any mountain lion
or any great cat or small cat,

1851
01:32:28,310 --> 01:32:31,330
um,
has contracted cwd and facts.

1852
01:32:31,331 --> 01:32:34,300
It's very interesting.
In a research study in Wyoming that I

1853
01:32:34,301 --> 01:32:36,060
was a part of,
um,

1854
01:32:36,120 --> 01:32:41,120
it turned out that the highest source of
mortality for cwt positive deer was

1855
01:32:41,771 --> 01:32:44,290
mountain line predation.
And so somebody is going,

1856
01:32:44,320 --> 01:32:45,153
ah,
Aha.

1857
01:32:45,520 --> 01:32:48,370
CWT doesn't always kill deer.
Well,

1858
01:32:48,640 --> 01:32:51,460
but it predisposes them.
So think about that.

1859
01:32:51,461 --> 01:32:55,900
Progressive neurological degeneration
and think about how mountain lions hunt.

1860
01:32:55,930 --> 01:32:59,920
They're ambush hunters.
So if you're a deer and you're not quite

1861
01:32:59,921 --> 01:33:00,970
right,
you know,

1862
01:33:01,010 --> 01:33:04,030
I mean this disease is developing in
your brain,

1863
01:33:04,031 --> 01:33:06,550
you're progressing progressive dementia.

1864
01:33:07,210 --> 01:33:10,030
It's not at the point where we are
humanized,

1865
01:33:10,031 --> 01:33:11,740
which really are very,
very poor.

1866
01:33:12,010 --> 01:33:17,010
We can't see disease yet,
but disease is progressing and an ambush

1867
01:33:17,381 --> 01:33:20,260
Predator can leverage that and take
advantage of that.

1868
01:33:20,500 --> 01:33:24,730
And that weakness in the prey.
We see the same thing in Colorado.

1869
01:33:24,760 --> 01:33:26,860
Um,
studies have identified that cwt

1870
01:33:26,861 --> 01:33:29,260
positive,
do your tend to get hit by cars more

1871
01:33:29,261 --> 01:33:31,100
often than cwt.
Negative negativity.

1872
01:33:31,710 --> 01:33:33,550
It,
it's very logical.

1873
01:33:34,090 --> 01:33:37,690
So now let's extend that to two wolves
and asked the question,

1874
01:33:37,691 --> 01:33:41,410
could wolves be a management tool for
cwd?

1875
01:33:41,770 --> 01:33:45,580
Okay.
Wolves are present in northern

1876
01:33:45,581 --> 01:33:47,450
Wisconsin.
You know a lot of them over there,

1877
01:33:47,600 --> 01:33:52,600
a lot of other locations and at some
point wolves and cwd we'll meet.

1878
01:33:55,060 --> 01:33:57,520
So there's been mathematical models
developed,

1879
01:33:57,610 --> 01:33:59,920
which are,
there's a lot of assumptions built in

1880
01:33:59,921 --> 01:34:02,350
those models,
but it leaves it as an open question.

1881
01:34:02,351 --> 01:34:07,351
Could a large coursing Predator who's
vision and senses are much more acute

1882
01:34:08,951 --> 01:34:09,784
than ours.

1883
01:34:10,210 --> 01:34:13,990
Could they take advantage of this
disease in earlier stages?

1884
01:34:14,020 --> 01:34:16,780
And so when disease meets
geographically,

1885
01:34:16,960 --> 01:34:21,960
Wolf's could wolves slow or maybe stop
the progression of disease because

1886
01:34:23,470 --> 01:34:28,060
they're taking the weak and the sick and
the old still wouldn't stop the

1887
01:34:28,061 --> 01:34:33,061
excretion and it still wouldn't stop all
of the bodily fluids and they could they

1888
01:34:33,820 --> 01:34:37,030
could they slow the spread or stop the
spread?

1889
01:34:37,540 --> 01:34:41,980
Maybe could they reverse disease?
You could likely take all the predators.

1890
01:34:41,981 --> 01:34:46,720
You could find wolves and mountain lions
and dump them into Iowa county just

1891
01:34:46,721 --> 01:34:51,130
south of where Doug lives and they
likely would not be able to eliminate

1892
01:34:51,131 --> 01:34:54,280
disease.
But at that [inaudible] has disease

1893
01:34:54,281 --> 01:34:58,460
spreads geographically at the interface.
Could predators

1894
01:34:58,940 --> 01:35:02,420
be an effective tool to slow or stop
disease from spreading?

1895
01:35:02,810 --> 01:35:07,810
It's an interesting question.
Especially when states are contemplating

1896
01:35:08,840 --> 01:35:12,920
more aggressive control measures opening
up hunting and trapping seasons to

1897
01:35:12,921 --> 01:35:15,230
reduce population densities.
So woes.

1898
01:35:15,710 --> 01:35:19,460
So we don't have good tools and I'll
leave it an open question.

1899
01:35:19,461 --> 01:35:22,990
Do we want to take that potential tool
and take it out of the tool?

1900
01:35:23,250 --> 01:35:24,590
What about,
what about,

1901
01:35:24,860 --> 01:35:26,000
uh,
okay.

1902
01:35:26,120 --> 01:35:26,561
So,
uh,

1903
01:35:26,561 --> 01:35:28,580
Wolvercote well,
coyote by us,

1904
01:35:28,810 --> 01:35:31,820
you know,
they're eating deer die in our woods and

1905
01:35:31,821 --> 01:35:32,654
you know,
from,

1906
01:35:32,690 --> 01:35:34,020
we found a dead one,
uh,

1907
01:35:34,040 --> 01:35:38,720
last time Steve was there and I was very
suspicious of it being a cw,

1908
01:35:38,721 --> 01:35:40,610
cause it was a two and a half year old
buck.

1909
01:35:40,611 --> 01:35:43,760
It was laying there and it turns out it
was probably hit by a car,

1910
01:35:43,761 --> 01:35:47,000
but it was fairly well consumed by
coyotes by then.

1911
01:35:47,690 --> 01:35:51,110
Um,
and I cut the head off of it and sent it

1912
01:35:51,111 --> 01:35:52,010
in and it came back.

1913
01:35:52,010 --> 01:35:56,480
Non-Positive um,
what happens when that coyote,

1914
01:35:56,481 --> 01:35:59,420
which is going to travel while they're
traveling huge distances,

1915
01:35:59,421 --> 01:36:03,500
but,
so he's eaten a cwd positive deer on the

1916
01:36:03,501 --> 01:36:07,400
durian farm and he's running over to
bunker hill seven or eight miles away

1917
01:36:07,401 --> 01:36:11,230
because they do that and he takes us to
dump over there.

1918
01:36:11,320 --> 01:36:12,290
Yeah,
we've done that.

1919
01:36:12,291 --> 01:36:16,250
Science has been done and so it turns
out if you take cwt,

1920
01:36:16,340 --> 01:36:19,370
cwt positive material,
you put it in the front end of a coyote,

1921
01:36:19,910 --> 01:36:23,720
it comes out the backend of a coyote and
it's still capable.

1922
01:36:23,750 --> 01:36:27,050
It's still infectious.
They still infectivity and it is capable

1923
01:36:27,051 --> 01:36:29,930
of transmitting disease.
You said mice don't get it.

1924
01:36:29,960 --> 01:36:32,600
A rats eat coyote poop,
correct?

1925
01:36:33,020 --> 01:36:33,741
Yeah.
Yeah.

1926
01:36:33,741 --> 01:36:34,720
So they,
they,

1927
01:36:34,910 --> 01:36:37,430
they don't get it.
Not that we're aware of.

1928
01:36:37,460 --> 01:36:39,230
Um,
there's a potentially spread it and

1929
01:36:39,231 --> 01:36:41,690
their urine because they would be
carrying it.

1930
01:36:42,020 --> 01:36:43,280
So that,
that kind of,

1931
01:36:43,610 --> 01:36:47,060
and I have to ask you,
you say he could eat cwd positive

1932
01:36:47,061 --> 01:36:50,000
material,
you could poop it out x number of hours

1933
01:36:50,001 --> 01:36:52,040
later and he might be a mile or two
away.

1934
01:36:52,340 --> 01:36:54,830
Okay.
So that's a fairly local geographic

1935
01:36:54,831 --> 01:36:58,400
phenomenon that could be spreading
infectious material.

1936
01:36:58,820 --> 01:37:00,880
Now you have to ask your self,
you know,

1937
01:37:00,950 --> 01:37:04,910
more questions when they defecate on the
landscape.

1938
01:37:05,390 --> 01:37:08,810
Is it dear likely to encounter and
consume that material?

1939
01:37:08,960 --> 01:37:10,040
Well,
maybe not now,

1940
01:37:10,041 --> 01:37:14,240
but it might be fertilizer two years
down the road for plants if the deer

1941
01:37:14,241 --> 01:37:15,440
could eat.
So,

1942
01:37:15,560 --> 01:37:17,300
but I think that's just quite
restricted.

1943
01:37:17,301 --> 01:37:20,690
It's a localized geographic phenomenon.
Okay.

1944
01:37:21,110 --> 01:37:23,150
And that's something that we can do a
hell of a lot about.

1945
01:37:23,240 --> 01:37:25,530
It's hard to,
same thing with,

1946
01:37:25,550 --> 01:37:28,580
with crows,
you can put cwd in the front end of a

1947
01:37:28,581 --> 01:37:33,020
crow or probably other scavengers and
cwd comes out the back end about four

1948
01:37:33,021 --> 01:37:35,660
hours later she could ask her Christoph
the question,

1949
01:37:35,661 --> 01:37:39,590
how far does it crow fly in for hours?
And it is a deer likely to consume crow

1950
01:37:39,591 --> 01:37:44,591
poop.
So these had been shown to be possible

1951
01:37:45,410 --> 01:37:50,410
in a laboratory environment,
but how much they really apply out in

1952
01:37:50,721 --> 01:37:54,440
the field is of Co of question.
So we go back,

1953
01:37:54,441 --> 01:37:55,920
we know that deer,
the deer,

1954
01:37:55,921 --> 01:37:56,000
the

1955
01:37:56,000 --> 01:37:56,641
deer,
the deer,

1956
01:37:56,641 --> 01:37:59,490
we see that slow diffusive process on
the landscape.

1957
01:37:59,670 --> 01:38:04,260
That's the biggie that's going on just
south of him and now his past him.

1958
01:38:05,130 --> 01:38:07,230
Then we have that answer.
Pathetic movement,

1959
01:38:07,290 --> 01:38:12,210
Yo humans moving long distances and the
potential for agricultural commodities

1960
01:38:12,211 --> 01:38:15,750
to be involved.
I mean there's likely other things like

1961
01:38:15,751 --> 01:38:20,130
crows and coyotes,
I a proof of concept in a laboratory,

1962
01:38:20,131 --> 01:38:23,340
but whether they're really happening in
the field as an isn't entirely open

1963
01:38:23,341 --> 01:38:25,170
question.
And if they are,

1964
01:38:25,470 --> 01:38:28,950
how big are they as compared to these
other features?

1965
01:38:30,090 --> 01:38:33,690
So why not do the,
you know,

1966
01:38:33,870 --> 01:38:34,370
and,
and,

1967
01:38:34,370 --> 01:38:36,300
and some of the detractors will also
say,

1968
01:38:36,301 --> 01:38:39,810
well,
you can't stop dear from doing dear

1969
01:38:39,811 --> 01:38:40,710
activities.
Right?

1970
01:38:40,830 --> 01:38:44,610
And branches licking each other,
uh,

1971
01:38:45,930 --> 01:38:47,940
those,
those,

1972
01:38:48,150 --> 01:38:52,470
those normal dear activities.
But if we're concentrating them in an

1973
01:38:52,471 --> 01:38:54,570
area,
let's say a mineral lick,

1974
01:38:55,250 --> 01:38:58,880
um,
where every deer in the area comes

1975
01:38:58,881 --> 01:39:02,730
through there and then looks at in there
or a feeder or a feeder,

1976
01:39:03,190 --> 01:39:04,470
um,
and you know,

1977
01:39:04,471 --> 01:39:06,420
a bait pile.
Um,

1978
01:39:07,140 --> 01:39:07,890
uh,
and,

1979
01:39:07,890 --> 01:39:09,240
and we've seen bait.
I mean,

1980
01:39:09,241 --> 01:39:11,060
I've seen bait piles where there's a
pile of corn.

1981
01:39:11,061 --> 01:39:11,980
It was a pile of apples.
Well,

1982
01:39:11,981 --> 01:39:14,240
they're all eating off the same pie.
You've got all these deer coming into

1983
01:39:14,250 --> 01:39:16,260
that.
That's something that we can do

1984
01:39:16,261 --> 01:39:20,640
something about.
There are all these natural movements

1985
01:39:20,641 --> 01:39:24,300
that we can't do anything about,
but if we can slow the spread by

1986
01:39:24,301 --> 01:39:28,530
stopping these unnatural gatherings of,
during these unnatural,

1987
01:39:29,100 --> 01:39:30,690
you know,
spreading of the disease,

1988
01:39:30,780 --> 01:39:31,860
why wouldn't we do that?

1989
01:39:32,310 --> 01:39:33,440
Yeah.
There's a few things.

1990
01:39:33,450 --> 01:39:35,400
You know,
you keep honing in on,

1991
01:39:35,670 --> 01:39:38,370
you know,
there's these anthropogenic factors and

1992
01:39:38,371 --> 01:39:43,371
then what can we do where disease is
truly his ear?

1993
01:39:43,950 --> 01:39:46,440
The things you're talking about,
the baiting and feeding artificial

1994
01:39:46,441 --> 01:39:48,600
congregations of animals.
Okay.

1995
01:39:48,990 --> 01:39:51,990
Um,
in where TB is in,

1996
01:39:51,991 --> 01:39:53,850
in Michigan,
you can't bait and feed.

1997
01:39:53,851 --> 01:39:56,430
And in Wisconsin,
some of the other states where cewd is,

1998
01:39:56,431 --> 01:40:00,090
you can't bait and feed deer.
The idea is you're artificially

1999
01:40:00,091 --> 01:40:02,730
congregating them.
So remember that single deer,

2000
01:40:02,731 --> 01:40:05,130
we saw him up there on the screen is
shedding Mayo,

2001
01:40:05,190 --> 01:40:08,880
copious amounts of saliva.
So if that deer goes up to a pile of

2002
01:40:08,881 --> 01:40:12,570
corn on the ground,
he's sharing spreading infectious agent

2003
01:40:12,571 --> 01:40:15,690
into that corn.
It can persist on that corn for a long,

2004
01:40:15,691 --> 01:40:17,070
long time.
Decades,

2005
01:40:17,370 --> 01:40:18,270
healthy,
naive,

2006
01:40:18,271 --> 01:40:20,810
susceptible animal comes up at each set
corner,

2007
01:40:20,820 --> 01:40:25,350
licks that mineral lick and it's likely
that that animal is ingesting viable

2008
01:40:25,351 --> 01:40:27,660
infectious agent can transmit disease.

2009
01:40:28,290 --> 01:40:28,960
Um,
the,

2010
01:40:28,960 --> 01:40:29,791
the,
the,

2011
01:40:29,791 --> 01:40:33,150
the analogy there is,
is his daycare.

2012
01:40:33,570 --> 01:40:36,450
Okay,
if you want to get your kid's sick,

2013
01:40:36,480 --> 01:40:39,780
your three year old kids sick,
what's the best place to do it?

2014
01:40:40,290 --> 01:40:45,290
Send them to send them to daycare.
Daycare is the analogy.

2015
01:40:46,111 --> 01:40:48,120
There is that pile of corn on the
ground.

2016
01:40:48,420 --> 01:40:52,200
So if every child that ever goes to
daycare is perfectly healthy,

2017
01:40:52,560 --> 01:40:56,410
they're not little disease factories,
but we know that's not the case.

2018
01:40:56,860 --> 01:41:00,580
So they're in a great place in schools
are a great place to spread disease and

2019
01:41:00,581 --> 01:41:03,550
then those kids come home and share it
with you and then you can share it with

2020
01:41:03,551 --> 01:41:04,384
others.
Right?

2021
01:41:04,660 --> 01:41:07,480
Same thing there.
So these artificial congregations,

2022
01:41:07,810 --> 01:41:09,970
if all the deer healthy,
we'll then,

2023
01:41:09,971 --> 01:41:12,190
they can't be a place to transmit
disease,

2024
01:41:12,220 --> 01:41:14,980
but we know that's not the case.
So it's an iguana.

2025
01:41:14,990 --> 01:41:16,840
Those risk factors we can control.

2026
01:41:17,170 --> 01:41:18,380
But now you hit doug,
you know,

2027
01:41:18,400 --> 01:41:21,790
we get back to this area where disease
is established.

2028
01:41:21,791 --> 01:41:25,870
Is there anything we can do?
And there's certainly things we can try,

2029
01:41:26,110 --> 01:41:26,980
right?
And we haven't,

2030
01:41:27,070 --> 01:41:30,640
we haven't exhausted the toolkit yet.
Um,

2031
01:41:30,700 --> 01:41:34,350
Mike Samuel at uws and I now retired.
Um,

2032
01:41:34,400 --> 01:41:36,970
he,
he looked at this from a mathematical

2033
01:41:36,971 --> 01:41:41,440
perspective and he's trying to leverage
the idea that adult males have higher

2034
01:41:41,441 --> 01:41:42,610
prevalence,
right?

2035
01:41:43,420 --> 01:41:48,420
So there they are sync spur disease,
they're gathering disease and then

2036
01:41:49,541 --> 01:41:51,520
they're shedders of diseases.
Well.

2037
01:41:52,090 --> 01:41:56,320
So what if in our harvest regime,
in hunting season,

2038
01:41:56,830 --> 01:41:59,350
we focused on adult males.
Okay,

2039
01:41:59,740 --> 01:42:04,060
we hammer the bucks because they're the
ones most likely to have disease.

2040
01:42:04,630 --> 01:42:09,490
So we would lower prevalence and that
we're reducing the proportion of the

2041
01:42:09,491 --> 01:42:12,280
population with the highest prevalence
of disease.

2042
01:42:12,700 --> 01:42:17,320
The idea is if you knock that segment
down enough that you would interrupt

2043
01:42:17,321 --> 01:42:22,321
disease transmission cycles and you
could actually lower herd prevalence

2044
01:42:22,960 --> 01:42:23,650
over time.

2045
01:42:23,650 --> 01:42:25,990
Now you still have the persistence in
the environment,

2046
01:42:26,740 --> 01:42:29,800
but on from a modeling basis,
it works.

2047
01:42:30,420 --> 01:42:32,290
All right,
so now think about the deer hunter out

2048
01:42:32,291 --> 01:42:35,110
there listening to me today,
listening to this show today.

2049
01:42:35,350 --> 01:42:37,570
Oh,
now they want us to go out and kill all

2050
01:42:37,571 --> 01:42:42,571
the bucks.
So it's not going to be a very desirable

2051
01:42:42,671 --> 01:42:47,671
from a hunter's perspective tool.
So all the tools we have,

2052
01:42:47,861 --> 01:42:51,190
you considered these like medicine for
bird disease.

2053
01:42:51,880 --> 01:42:54,430
They're very bitter.
It is a bitter pill.

2054
01:42:54,490 --> 01:42:55,360
I,
you know,

2055
01:42:55,720 --> 01:42:58,720
you were there when we were still doing
the wearing the Sombrero.

2056
01:42:58,721 --> 01:42:59,554
If you,
uh,

2057
01:42:59,850 --> 01:43:02,230
you know,
shot a smaller buck or whatever and uh,

2058
01:43:02,840 --> 01:43:05,380
yeah,
we had a management idea that we wanted

2059
01:43:05,381 --> 01:43:09,040
to grow some bigger bucks,
but at the same time we were pretty

2060
01:43:09,041 --> 01:43:10,810
lenient about it.
Um,

2061
01:43:11,280 --> 01:43:12,880
we,
we're not doing that anymore.

2062
01:43:13,000 --> 01:43:15,850
The deer I shot last year were deer that
seven,

2063
01:43:15,851 --> 01:43:16,360
eight years ago.

2064
01:43:16,360 --> 01:43:19,690
I wouldn't even take another look at
that first bucket shot.

2065
01:43:19,691 --> 01:43:21,960
The first buck I had an ethical shot.
Yeah.

2066
01:43:22,000 --> 01:43:25,190
Or the I'm giving you more tags or give
housing.

2067
01:43:25,370 --> 01:43:29,800
Know
there's resistance resistance in the

2068
01:43:29,801 --> 01:43:32,380
hunting community to that.
Um,

2069
01:43:32,440 --> 01:43:34,570
that's unfortunate.
It is unfortunate.

2070
01:43:34,860 --> 01:43:36,640
Um,
I'm not one of those,

2071
01:43:36,850 --> 01:43:39,550
those people,
we are in my part of the county deer

2072
01:43:39,551 --> 01:43:43,780
advisory committee and we're giving more
doterra eggs or antlerless tags because

2073
01:43:44,020 --> 01:43:45,820
the other part of it,
sure.

2074
01:43:45,821 --> 01:43:46,660
We have a,
uh,

2075
01:43:46,700 --> 01:43:49,760
a population in the box that because
their sinks as he said,

2076
01:43:49,761 --> 01:43:51,760
and they're spreading the disease,
um,

2077
01:43:51,800 --> 01:43:52,070
and,

2078
01:43:52,070 --> 01:43:53,620
and they're traveling more,
you know,

2079
01:43:53,740 --> 01:43:57,080
a doe and her family tend to kind of
stay in one area a little bit more where

2080
01:43:57,081 --> 01:43:59,430
the bucks have a bigger range.
Um,

2081
01:43:59,570 --> 01:44:01,530
but the other thing is then is
population.

2082
01:44:01,531 --> 01:44:03,800
So one of the things that,
for a couple of different reasons,

2083
01:44:03,801 --> 01:44:05,510
I mean,
you saw the number of deer that we have

2084
01:44:05,511 --> 01:44:10,511
in our place in richland county.
We have in excess of 75 deer per square

2085
01:44:10,641 --> 01:44:13,010
mile of habitat.
And I know there's places in the country

2086
01:44:13,011 --> 01:44:14,990
that are higher than that,
but,

2087
01:44:14,991 --> 01:44:16,190
um,
you know,

2088
01:44:16,191 --> 01:44:17,024
it's,
it's sort of a,

2089
01:44:18,840 --> 01:44:20,930
it's a,
it's a big population and I'm,

2090
01:44:21,170 --> 01:44:22,910
I have issue with it for a few different
reasons.

2091
01:44:22,911 --> 01:44:25,430
One of them's disease.
The other one is that when I have too

2092
01:44:25,431 --> 01:44:27,770
many deer,
my little oak trees are getting because

2093
01:44:27,771 --> 01:44:31,130
they love those little oak trees and
they're getting chewed off and I'm

2094
01:44:31,131 --> 01:44:32,570
trying to do multiple things.

2095
01:44:32,570 --> 01:44:34,790
I'm not just trying to raise deer on our
farm,

2096
01:44:35,370 --> 01:44:36,650
um,
and our woodlands.

2097
01:44:36,920 --> 01:44:38,390
So,
uh,

2098
01:44:38,780 --> 01:44:39,613
you know,
that,

2099
01:44:39,860 --> 01:44:43,280
that's one of the issues.
So there's this demographic issue that,

2100
01:44:43,430 --> 01:44:43,930
that,
uh,

2101
01:44:43,930 --> 01:44:45,890
Mike Samuel,
it had been working on,

2102
01:44:45,980 --> 01:44:47,960
but then there's the population issue as
well.

2103
01:44:48,590 --> 01:44:50,840
Um,
we're given four.

2104
01:44:51,190 --> 01:44:52,550
When I,
when I was a kid,

2105
01:44:53,060 --> 01:44:56,930
when you bought up buck license,
you and four other dudes would get

2106
01:44:56,931 --> 01:45:01,640
together and then fill out this form and
send it in and like August to get a,

2107
01:45:01,641 --> 01:45:05,960
what was called a party tag.
And you could shoot one doe between four

2108
01:45:05,961 --> 01:45:08,840
people because we had,
um,

2109
01:45:09,170 --> 01:45:12,060
they were trying to manage the herd to,
to have mortier.

2110
01:45:12,110 --> 01:45:13,730
Cause again,
when I was a kid seeing deer,

2111
01:45:13,731 --> 01:45:16,250
it was a big deal.
It's exact opposite now.

2112
01:45:16,490 --> 01:45:21,490
So now you buy,
you get a buck tag and you get for a

2113
01:45:21,980 --> 01:45:24,920
antlerless tags with every tag that you
buy in our county.

2114
01:45:24,950 --> 01:45:28,070
What changed from when you were a kid
where the population exploded?

2115
01:45:28,730 --> 01:45:30,020
Well,
uh,

2116
01:45:30,410 --> 01:45:32,810
management was a big part of it.
Um,

2117
01:45:32,990 --> 01:45:35,780
and the management exploded is,
I mean,

2118
01:45:35,960 --> 01:45:38,780
I'm going to be 60 years old.
She was an exotic and look.

2119
01:45:38,781 --> 01:45:39,890
Great.
Well,

2120
01:45:39,891 --> 01:45:41,480
thank you very much as the,
you

2121
01:45:43,490 --> 01:45:44,900
and Brian,
you look pretty good too.

2122
01:45:45,400 --> 01:45:46,550
Um,
pretty good.

2123
01:45:47,810 --> 01:45:51,020
Jamie on the other hand over that,
I know he's still a young buck,

2124
01:45:52,180 --> 01:45:54,230
no kid,
but,

2125
01:45:54,231 --> 01:45:55,100
uh,
uh,

2126
01:45:55,240 --> 01:45:56,073
I don't know.
Of course,

2127
01:45:56,320 --> 01:45:59,210
uh,
that's a pretty long period of time.

2128
01:45:59,390 --> 01:46:01,130
And when you,
uh,

2129
01:46:02,120 --> 01:46:06,140
when you're controlling because you
don't have many deer and your managing

2130
01:46:06,141 --> 01:46:10,140
to increase the deer herd and you have a
mentality out there that will,

2131
01:46:10,141 --> 01:46:11,690
I'm not going to shoot a dope because,
you know,

2132
01:46:11,691 --> 01:46:13,410
those are the,
um,

2133
01:46:14,450 --> 01:46:17,810
and they're having to fonts.
And this year,

2134
01:46:18,200 --> 01:46:20,930
at least in my area,
we're seeing a lot of those having three

2135
01:46:20,931 --> 01:46:22,400
fonts.
That's,

2136
01:46:22,550 --> 01:46:24,400
you can see how that growth of,
of the,

2137
01:46:24,770 --> 01:46:25,603
the herd.

2138
01:46:26,040 --> 01:46:27,410
Yeah.
If you want to hurt to grow,

2139
01:46:27,411 --> 01:46:30,290
stop shooting dose,
if you want to take a her down,

2140
01:46:30,500 --> 01:46:31,370
you know,
shoot does,

2141
01:46:31,610 --> 01:46:33,950
I'm gonna get back in Grad School in
Illinois,

2142
01:46:33,951 --> 01:46:36,920
they gave away these little pins that
hunters collected.

2143
01:46:36,980 --> 01:46:39,770
And when you brought a dough into the
registration station,

2144
01:46:39,771 --> 01:46:41,690
you got a pin that said,
I shot a doe.

2145
01:46:41,691 --> 01:46:43,750
So the herd won't grow.
You know,

2146
01:46:43,780 --> 01:46:48,780
people collected these little momentos
during that time frame.

2147
01:46:48,990 --> 01:46:49,860
Like I said,
I grew up,

2148
01:46:49,890 --> 01:46:50,810
uh,
Yale,

2149
01:46:50,820 --> 01:46:53,940
a couple counties to the north and west
of where Doug was in,

2150
01:46:53,941 --> 01:46:55,840
in the,
in the 1960s.

2151
01:46:55,860 --> 01:46:58,410
I mean,
there weren't a lot of deer around there

2152
01:46:58,800 --> 01:46:59,970
and watched,
you know,

2153
01:46:59,971 --> 01:47:01,130
as I grew up.
Yeah.

2154
01:47:01,160 --> 01:47:02,950
We,
we didn't shoot many dose.

2155
01:47:02,951 --> 01:47:07,320
The regulations in the state didn't
allow you to shoot dose by 1980 on

2156
01:47:07,321 --> 01:47:10,920
opening day.
I remember I counted 160 dear on opening

2157
01:47:10,920 --> 01:47:12,810
day,
15 years before that,

2158
01:47:13,020 --> 01:47:15,480
probably saw three,
something like that.

2159
01:47:15,480 --> 01:47:19,110
So exponential growth in the deer
population over that point in time.

2160
01:47:19,500 --> 01:47:21,780
The deer management program worked
really well.

2161
01:47:21,870 --> 01:47:23,130
Oh yeah.
We know how to go out there.

2162
01:47:23,131 --> 01:47:25,920
And that along with all of that that,
that we've already talked about the

2163
01:47:25,921 --> 01:47:30,921
agriculture and the agriculture expanded
well agriculture but the uh,

2164
01:47:31,640 --> 01:47:33,570
but you know,
it was always there so it had the

2165
01:47:33,571 --> 01:47:37,430
potential for all of the explosion.
So,

2166
01:47:37,730 --> 01:47:40,080
so there's a interesting,
you know,

2167
01:47:40,081 --> 01:47:42,830
I talk with folks in,
in the state of Michigan and they've got

2168
01:47:42,950 --> 01:47:43,740
a shoe,
you know,

2169
01:47:43,740 --> 01:47:48,300
pro relatively recent likely issue is
cwd and yeah,

2170
01:47:48,301 --> 01:47:53,070
there's user groups out there that are
trying to advise the state on how to

2171
01:47:53,071 --> 01:47:56,160
manage cwd.
One of the groups is,

2172
01:47:56,240 --> 01:47:58,520
is talking about,
um,

2173
01:47:58,620 --> 01:48:01,080
it's called antler point restrictions.
Okay.

2174
01:48:01,440 --> 01:48:02,610
The idea is a,
you know,

2175
01:48:02,611 --> 01:48:06,660
a yearling buck,
18 months old has fairly small antlers

2176
01:48:06,780 --> 01:48:11,780
and then as they get older,
they typically get successively larger

2177
01:48:12,031 --> 01:48:12,864
antlers.

2178
01:48:13,920 --> 01:48:18,920
So a group is out there right now as an
active proponent of implementing antler

2179
01:48:19,411 --> 01:48:24,411
point restrictions and promoting
antlerless harvest at the same time.

2180
01:48:25,660 --> 01:48:28,470
Okay.
As a disease management tool.

2181
01:48:28,980 --> 01:48:30,450
So as we noted,
you know,

2182
01:48:30,451 --> 01:48:35,451
lowering the population that already how
cwd is beneficial in it.

2183
01:48:37,710 --> 01:48:42,330
If we have,
if we have a herd of 500 animals with

2184
01:48:42,331 --> 01:48:47,331
10% prevalence,
that's 50 positives versus a herd of 20

2185
01:48:47,341 --> 01:48:52,260
animals with 5% which would be one.
And that's a dramatic difference.

2186
01:48:52,620 --> 01:48:55,560
The prevalence is the same,
but we have fewer positives out there.

2187
01:48:55,590 --> 01:48:59,040
Right?
So lowering populations overall does

2188
01:48:59,041 --> 01:49:01,740
make sense with regard to disease.
Okay.

2189
01:49:02,130 --> 01:49:06,960
But now the other part of antler point
restrictions is allowing males to get

2190
01:49:06,961 --> 01:49:09,840
older.
And they argue that that will keep

2191
01:49:09,841 --> 01:49:12,090
hunters engaged.
And if hunters are engaged,

2192
01:49:12,091 --> 01:49:15,450
they'll shoot more dose and keep the
population down and that'll be a good

2193
01:49:15,451 --> 01:49:16,284
thing.

2194
01:49:16,440 --> 01:49:19,860
But you know,
we've already discussed how adult males

2195
01:49:20,240 --> 01:49:23,880
have tend to have the highest prevalence
of cwd.

2196
01:49:24,300 --> 01:49:25,440
Okay,
that's fair.

2197
01:49:25,441 --> 01:49:30,330
Now you're talking about promoting,
pushing more males into these older age

2198
01:49:30,331 --> 01:49:34,140
groups in an area where cwd has already
known to exist.

2199
01:49:35,190 --> 01:49:37,860
And so from a,
from a biological perspective,

2200
01:49:38,280 --> 01:49:41,460
from a numerical modeling perspective of
disease,

2201
01:49:41,970 --> 01:49:45,720
I failed to see how this can work.
Um,

2202
01:49:45,810 --> 01:49:50,810
so will keep in hunter's engaged.
That's a sociological question that I

2203
01:49:51,041 --> 01:49:56,020
can't really address.
But from a purely biological disease

2204
01:49:56,021 --> 01:50:01,021
driven process,
promoting more older aged ma animals,

2205
01:50:01,750 --> 01:50:06,750
older hd or in a population with cwd,
I cannot figure out how that could be

2206
01:50:07,061 --> 01:50:07,810
beneficial.

2207
01:50:07,810 --> 01:50:12,370
That seems the opposite.
I'm hoping that through this podcast,

2208
01:50:12,760 --> 01:50:17,410
this information becomes more digestible
because I think that in order to get

2209
01:50:17,411 --> 01:50:21,520
what you just laid out over two hours,
in order for someone to get that by

2210
01:50:21,521 --> 01:50:23,380
reading,
it's like they're not going to do it.

2211
01:50:23,410 --> 01:50:24,940
Most hunters are just not going to do
it.

2212
01:50:24,941 --> 01:50:29,200
And so I,
I have a feeling that like what Ted

2213
01:50:29,201 --> 01:50:32,160
nugent had said that this is a,
the,

2214
01:50:32,260 --> 01:50:36,640
his perspective is possibly way more
prevalent than should be.

2215
01:50:37,000 --> 01:50:40,270
And because this information is not that
digestible,

2216
01:50:41,560 --> 01:50:43,810
I think that there's,
you know,

2217
01:50:43,811 --> 01:50:45,910
the,
I know you talked about it on meter

2218
01:50:46,030 --> 01:50:51,030
episode 70 70 and then now today,
this is going to reach a lot more people

2219
01:50:52,481 --> 01:50:55,810
and it's in a very digestible form where
they get to sit down and listen to it.

2220
01:50:56,350 --> 01:51:01,000
And hopefully we can get the word out on
this in a way that it's not getting out

2221
01:51:01,001 --> 01:51:03,100
now.
So people understand the consequences of

2222
01:51:03,101 --> 01:51:04,300
this.
This is a real issue.

2223
01:51:04,510 --> 01:51:06,250
And it's,
this is not simply like,

2224
01:51:06,370 --> 01:51:07,990
hey,
we don't want to do this because this

2225
01:51:07,991 --> 01:51:10,390
could negatively impact our hunting
opportunities.

2226
01:51:10,630 --> 01:51:13,660
We might not have any hunting
opportunities in 10 years or 20 years

2227
01:51:13,860 --> 01:51:17,020
like this.
This literally could devastate the

2228
01:51:17,021 --> 01:51:19,390
entire population of deer.
This is not,

2229
01:51:19,680 --> 01:51:23,440
it's not a simple thing.
This is an incredibly complex thing with

2230
01:51:23,441 --> 01:51:28,441
a terrible disease that is 100% fatal
and is absolutely spreading.

2231
01:51:29,050 --> 01:51:31,150
No question.
Some of the,

2232
01:51:31,320 --> 01:51:33,340
you know,
the take home points,

2233
01:51:33,341 --> 01:51:35,920
I always thinking and I get regularly
asked by hunters,

2234
01:51:35,921 --> 01:51:36,820
will,
what can I do?

2235
01:51:37,300 --> 01:51:38,500
Okay,
well what a hunter's do.

2236
01:51:38,501 --> 01:51:41,380
They sit at deer camp and they shoot the
crap around,

2237
01:51:41,510 --> 01:51:43,990
you know,
whatever libations or whatever.

2238
01:51:44,460 --> 01:51:46,210
So,
and they're going to talk about things

2239
01:51:46,211 --> 01:51:50,170
like cwd and good.
So let those conver conversations be

2240
01:51:50,171 --> 01:51:54,010
driven by fact and science as opposed to
rumor and Innuendo.

2241
01:51:54,030 --> 01:51:54,790
Right?
Okay.

2242
01:51:54,790 --> 01:51:57,220
That's what we're doing here to that.
And that's why I think this public

2243
01:51:57,221 --> 01:51:59,530
information is,
is so important.

2244
01:52:00,250 --> 01:52:03,580
There's other things it can do.
We talked to doug hit on a bunch of

2245
01:52:03,581 --> 01:52:04,414
them,
you know,

2246
01:52:04,450 --> 01:52:07,300
hunting as part of a,
promoting a healthy deer herd.

2247
01:52:07,690 --> 01:52:12,690
Can't haunting keep populations low.
Test your deer and manage those

2248
01:52:13,631 --> 01:52:16,120
carcasses.
Don't leave them out on the landscape.

2249
01:52:16,810 --> 01:52:19,690
There's another category though of
things it can be done.

2250
01:52:20,190 --> 01:52:21,220
You know,
in deer camp,

2251
01:52:21,221 --> 01:52:24,670
what's the easiest thing to do is blame
the dnr for everything.

2252
01:52:24,700 --> 01:52:26,680
The Department of natural resources.
Okay.

2253
01:52:26,681 --> 01:52:27,110
It's,
it's a,

2254
01:52:27,110 --> 01:52:31,330
it's almost a sport to kick around at
night and see who can insult the dnr the

2255
01:52:31,331 --> 01:52:32,164
worst.
Right?

2256
01:52:32,530 --> 01:52:35,950
So it was regard to disease though.
Is that really an effective use of your

2257
01:52:35,951 --> 01:52:37,240
time?
It might be fun,

2258
01:52:37,570 --> 01:52:41,860
but it's likely not affected because
think of the state management agencies

2259
01:52:41,861 --> 01:52:44,500
that deal with deer.
It might be the Agriculture Department

2260
01:52:44,501 --> 01:52:47,720
or the natural department.
They're very,

2261
01:52:47,721 --> 01:52:51,080
very restricted in what they can do
there within a legislator.

2262
01:52:51,120 --> 01:52:54,020
Operate within a legislative framework.
Okay.

2263
01:52:54,410 --> 01:52:58,640
So if you really want to impact change
in how a government agency goes about

2264
01:52:58,641 --> 01:53:02,060
its business,
should you talk to the local biologist

2265
01:53:02,630 --> 01:53:06,710
or should you talk to the elected leader
who establishes the legislative

2266
01:53:06,711 --> 01:53:09,560
framework that that agency works
underneath?

2267
01:53:09,800 --> 01:53:11,800
It's important to put pressure on,
uh,

2268
01:53:12,420 --> 01:53:16,820
on our elected representatives and,
and we've seen change in that in well,

2269
01:53:16,821 --> 01:53:19,240
Wisconsin being a great example.
Um,

2270
01:53:19,400 --> 01:53:20,680
are,
uh,

2271
01:53:20,750 --> 01:53:25,460
management used to be science based
wildlife biologists making decisions

2272
01:53:25,461 --> 01:53:28,040
about deer management.
It's politically based.

2273
01:53:28,041 --> 01:53:31,400
Now politicians are,
are deciding what the,

2274
01:53:31,460 --> 01:53:33,460
you'll,
you'll often hear that in uh,

2275
01:53:33,760 --> 01:53:36,560
I will county Wisconsin where this,
this first effort started.

2276
01:53:37,040 --> 01:53:38,480
Um,
well see it didn't work up.

2277
01:53:38,481 --> 01:53:39,291
Their dnr is,
you know,

2278
01:53:39,291 --> 01:53:41,900
they had this idea and it didn't work to
stop the disease.

2279
01:53:42,320 --> 01:53:44,060
It didn't get a chance to work because

2280
01:53:45,000 --> 01:53:50,000
social and political pressures and
political stars forced the dnr to vacate

2281
01:53:50,251 --> 01:53:52,320
their plants and their aggressive
measures.

2282
01:53:52,970 --> 01:53:54,440
And even more recently,
and there's a,

2283
01:53:54,470 --> 01:53:55,830
but it was a court case,
uh,

2284
01:53:55,831 --> 01:53:58,710
the state of Missouri,
the Missouri Department of Conservation

2285
01:53:58,711 --> 01:54:02,520
tried to implement some restrictions on
the captive serving industry to stop

2286
01:54:02,550 --> 01:54:06,750
importation of live deer seeing them as
a risk factor.

2287
01:54:07,330 --> 01:54:09,930
Um,
the deer breeders sued the state,

2288
01:54:10,460 --> 01:54:13,680
uh,
went through the court system and,

2289
01:54:13,681 --> 01:54:16,980
uh,
it was decided by the Supreme Court in

2290
01:54:16,981 --> 01:54:18,840
the state of Missouri,
uh,

2291
01:54:18,841 --> 01:54:23,841
about three weeks ago that in fact,
all dear are,

2292
01:54:23,980 --> 01:54:26,730
you know,
reps or represent wild deer and that the

2293
01:54:26,731 --> 01:54:30,750
Department of conservation was well
within their constitutional and

2294
01:54:30,751 --> 01:54:35,751
legislative authority to implement
measures designed to protect the

2295
01:54:36,121 --> 01:54:39,990
integrity and viability of that deer
herd for future generations.

2296
01:54:39,991 --> 01:54:42,120
So the Supreme Court said,
yes,

2297
01:54:42,121 --> 01:54:45,990
Department of Conservation,
you do have the right to restrict import

2298
01:54:45,991 --> 01:54:50,430
of animals into captive serve facilities
to protect the integrity of the herd.

2299
01:54:50,850 --> 01:54:52,650
And it's the,
the,

2300
01:54:52,860 --> 01:54:56,370
the legislative part of it is really
important and I can't put too fine a

2301
01:54:56,371 --> 01:54:57,900
point on it.
Um,

2302
01:54:58,110 --> 01:55:02,970
laws can be changed and there's pressure
to do that under lot of for you know,

2303
01:55:02,971 --> 01:55:04,950
a lot of different reasons.
I've been a part of changing some

2304
01:55:04,951 --> 01:55:09,300
legislation it had to do with forestry
and I know how it's done.

2305
01:55:09,900 --> 01:55:13,530
Um,
and you know,

2306
01:55:13,950 --> 01:55:18,690
one of my favorite quotes from Ella
Leopold is ethical behavior is doing the

2307
01:55:19,410 --> 01:55:23,700
right thing
even when no one's watching.

2308
01:55:23,970 --> 01:55:28,440
And the wrong thing is legal.
So just because it's legal doesn't mean

2309
01:55:28,441 --> 01:55:31,140
it's the right thing to do and it
doesn't mean it's the ethical thing to

2310
01:55:31,141 --> 01:55:33,700
do.
Is there any potential to changing the,

2311
01:55:33,701 --> 01:55:38,280
the limits tag limits or making them
more widespread if they understand the

2312
01:55:38,281 --> 01:55:41,070
issue with this and they understand that
one of the main tools of,

2313
01:55:41,071 --> 01:55:43,860
of handling this in a more manner and

2314
01:55:44,040 --> 01:55:46,560
slowing the populate or slowing the
spread of this disease,

2315
01:55:46,561 --> 01:55:49,770
who the population at deer is reducing
the population itself.

2316
01:55:50,280 --> 01:55:51,510
It mean even the,
the,

2317
01:55:51,670 --> 01:55:56,040
these hunters would resist this because
it would limit hunting opportunities.

2318
01:55:56,820 --> 01:56:01,820
This could potentially be a large tool
in the toolbox of conservation and

2319
01:56:02,671 --> 01:56:05,760
stopping the spread.
Short answer on that is yes.

2320
01:56:05,970 --> 01:56:07,530
As I said,
I'm on the county deer advisory

2321
01:56:07,531 --> 01:56:10,470
committee.
We have the opportunity to give out as

2322
01:56:10,471 --> 01:56:13,200
many tags as antlerless tags is.
We want,

2323
01:56:13,230 --> 01:56:15,220
what about Antler tags?
Cause that's the issue,

2324
01:56:15,221 --> 01:56:16,560
right?
One that's it.

2325
01:56:16,561 --> 01:56:21,561
One per person is legislatively control.
But even with this disease,

2326
01:56:22,410 --> 01:56:24,790
which that might be the number one tool
to,

2327
01:56:24,850 --> 01:56:26,310
to slow down the spread.
Yeah.

2328
01:56:26,350 --> 01:56:30,610
We used to have a um,
a policy in uh,

2329
01:56:30,820 --> 01:56:35,820
Wisconsin called earn and buck.
And it was not particularly,

2330
01:56:37,030 --> 01:56:38,890
uh,
uh,

2331
01:56:39,730 --> 01:56:41,830
uh,
popular with a lot of hunters.

2332
01:56:41,831 --> 01:56:43,930
Cause you know,
I want to shoot my book and I don't want

2333
01:56:43,931 --> 01:56:45,010
to have,
shoot earn a buck.

2334
01:56:45,011 --> 01:56:48,550
He had to shoot a doe a last year to
earn a buck tag.

2335
01:56:49,210 --> 01:56:53,170
Um,
and it wasn't particularly popular.

2336
01:56:53,380 --> 01:56:55,790
That's really a mild way to put it.
Hmm.

2337
01:56:56,200 --> 01:57:01,200
Well it was a post [inaudible] opposed
by a very noisy group of hunters.

2338
01:57:02,110 --> 01:57:04,030
Just like,
and again,

2339
01:57:04,360 --> 01:57:07,180
with my experience with working with the
legislature,

2340
01:57:07,181 --> 01:57:11,260
a small group of people making a hell of
a lot of noise with a certain amount of

2341
01:57:11,261 --> 01:57:14,500
money can change things.
It wasn't popular.

2342
01:57:14,501 --> 01:57:16,660
It was popular with me as well.
Again,

2343
01:57:16,661 --> 01:57:18,610
you hunted on my farm,
um,

2344
01:57:19,150 --> 01:57:22,000
we shoot way more antler of a steer that
we shoot bucks.

2345
01:57:22,440 --> 01:57:25,690
Um,
when when earn a buck was in place,

2346
01:57:25,960 --> 01:57:30,960
we'd have a stack of buck takes because
we were shooting so many dose.

2347
01:57:31,180 --> 01:57:34,600
That was because it was politically or
socially,

2348
01:57:35,320 --> 01:57:37,480
uh,
became a political issue.

2349
01:57:37,930 --> 01:57:39,820
Um,
it was rescinded.

2350
01:57:40,120 --> 01:57:44,200
And so now what we found in Richland
county is we can give,

2351
01:57:44,620 --> 01:57:49,090
we could drop antlerless tags from a
helicopter to shoot as many as you want

2352
01:57:49,660 --> 01:57:53,290
and we're still gonna kill.
But the same number of those about the

2353
01:57:53,291 --> 01:57:54,190
same number of dose,
every,

2354
01:57:54,191 --> 01:57:55,960
there was a little bit and there's been
a little bit of an uptick.

2355
01:57:55,961 --> 01:57:58,660
But when we had earned a buck,
we killed a shitload of them,

2356
01:57:58,990 --> 01:58:00,430
you know,
three times as many.

2357
01:58:01,060 --> 01:58:02,850
And,
um,

2358
01:58:04,840 --> 01:58:07,150
it becomes a,
and I understand,

2359
01:58:07,151 --> 01:58:08,610
especially like casual hunters,
like,

2360
01:58:08,680 --> 01:58:10,900
you know,
gun hunters are a good example.

2361
01:58:11,280 --> 01:58:14,020
Bowhunters or you know,
different example because they're not as

2362
01:58:14,021 --> 01:58:15,880
casual,
but they're more interested in,

2363
01:58:15,960 --> 01:58:16,480
in,
you know,

2364
01:58:16,480 --> 01:58:19,900
killing the big,
big buck a generally,

2365
01:58:20,470 --> 01:58:22,480
um,
uh,

2366
01:58:23,780 --> 01:58:24,460
gone hunters.

2367
01:58:24,460 --> 01:58:26,340
Yeah.
You go out there for two or three days.

2368
01:58:26,341 --> 01:58:27,790
I mean,
you were there and we froze our asses

2369
01:58:27,791 --> 01:58:28,460
off.
I mean,

2370
01:58:28,460 --> 01:58:28,931
it's like,
well,

2371
01:58:28,931 --> 01:58:32,380
how long am I going to stay out here?
We have a really short season.

2372
01:58:32,500 --> 01:58:35,890
We initially had much longer season
when,

2373
01:58:35,970 --> 01:58:39,200
when the cwd management first started,
we had a much longer season.

2374
01:58:39,220 --> 01:58:40,510
I loved it.
Um,

2375
01:58:40,720 --> 01:58:42,550
I,
I got to hunt with folks that,

2376
01:58:42,860 --> 01:58:43,390
you know,
that,

2377
01:58:43,390 --> 01:58:46,870
that maybe had their own place to hunt
where I invited folks from the community

2378
01:58:46,871 --> 01:58:48,030
to come in and hunt.
Uh,

2379
01:58:48,340 --> 01:58:50,080
you know,
friends from different places came down

2380
01:58:50,081 --> 01:58:51,700
and hunted.
But again,

2381
01:58:53,370 --> 01:58:55,850
a small noisy group.
Um,

2382
01:58:55,900 --> 01:58:57,010
and I dunno,
smallest,

2383
01:58:57,190 --> 01:58:58,500
I don't know what the numbers are in
that,

2384
01:58:58,510 --> 01:58:59,800
but,
um,

2385
01:59:00,370 --> 01:59:04,350
made that go away.
So now we're back down to the 90 season.

2386
01:59:04,420 --> 01:59:06,000
It doesn't make any sense to me.
Like who,

2387
01:59:06,030 --> 01:59:08,740
who gave into that?
The politicians,

2388
01:59:09,510 --> 01:59:10,630
politicians understand

2389
01:59:10,920 --> 01:59:14,070
and they're doing it from an ignorance,
from point of ignorance,

2390
01:59:14,580 --> 01:59:16,290
political pressure,
political pressure.

2391
01:59:16,830 --> 01:59:19,770
I've got to hope that something like
this podcast gets to them.

2392
01:59:20,070 --> 01:59:20,970
I sure hope so.
Man.

2393
01:59:20,971 --> 01:59:24,270
I'm not sure why we came out.
This is a terrifying couple.

2394
01:59:24,360 --> 01:59:28,230
Couple of Erica.
So the Wisconsin experience was really

2395
01:59:28,380 --> 01:59:31,920
important and the data shows that the
first couple of years,

2396
01:59:31,921 --> 01:59:36,921
so they say aggressive management with
earn a buck was actually forcing the

2397
01:59:37,561 --> 01:59:41,100
population down,
but it was very unpopular.

2398
01:59:41,130 --> 01:59:42,870
And so,
um,

2399
01:59:42,960 --> 01:59:47,670
political pressure was applied and that
tool was taken out of the toolbox thrown

2400
01:59:47,671 --> 01:59:49,890
on the ground.
Immediately.

2401
01:59:50,220 --> 01:59:52,610
When you stop doing,
uh,

2402
01:59:52,650 --> 01:59:55,680
earn a buck and you stopped having
longer seasons,

2403
01:59:55,860 --> 01:59:59,340
the population trends reversed and
started going back up.

2404
01:59:59,670 --> 02:00:01,800
So it was easy to label,
Hey,

2405
02:00:01,801 --> 02:00:06,180
the dnr failed their effort to eliminate
disease by,

2406
02:00:06,450 --> 02:00:09,630
by having aggressive seasons failed.
Like Doug said,

2407
02:00:09,631 --> 02:00:11,760
we don't know that because we stopped.

2408
02:00:11,760 --> 02:00:14,520
We pulled the plug on the tool,
Alberta,

2409
02:00:15,090 --> 02:00:18,930
when the wind cwd started really
blossoming in Saskatchewan,

2410
02:00:18,931 --> 02:00:20,820
Alberta was like,
we don't want it.

2411
02:00:20,940 --> 02:00:24,000
And they found their first handful of
cases right on the border between

2412
02:00:24,001 --> 02:00:26,490
Alberta and Saskatchewan.
They took,

2413
02:00:26,520 --> 02:00:31,440
they raise the odds a little bit.
They started harvesting deer from an

2414
02:00:31,441 --> 02:00:34,760
aerial platform called a helicopter.
Okay.

2415
02:00:35,190 --> 02:00:40,190
That helicopter with government agents,
sharp shooting deer to try and basically

2416
02:00:41,251 --> 02:00:45,420
eliminate deer in a buffer zone between
Saskatchewan and Alberta,

2417
02:00:45,840 --> 02:00:49,110
knock the disease,
deer out and create a buffer zone where

2418
02:00:49,111 --> 02:00:52,950
disease wasn't well,
that was not very popular either.

2419
02:00:52,951 --> 02:00:57,000
Like a Fart in church and uh,
land owners and outfitters went to the

2420
02:00:57,001 --> 02:00:59,430
ministry and said,
we can't possibly have this.

2421
02:00:59,700 --> 02:01:04,700
And that program I had every chance of
being successful and the rug was pulled

2422
02:01:05,341 --> 02:01:07,140
out from underneath them.
Okay.

2423
02:01:07,380 --> 02:01:09,270
So now here we have time.

2424
02:01:09,390 --> 02:01:10,141
Sure.
We are,

2425
02:01:10,141 --> 02:01:11,070
uh,
you know,

2426
02:01:11,071 --> 02:01:14,590
years later and the western states,
you know,

2427
02:01:14,710 --> 02:01:16,110
Montana,
Colorado,

2428
02:01:16,140 --> 02:01:18,570
Wyoming,
where disease has been a long time.

2429
02:01:19,200 --> 02:01:24,030
Their wildlife health professionals,
I have put together a set of uniform

2430
02:01:24,031 --> 02:01:29,031
management recommendations for the
western states came and they're

2431
02:01:29,521 --> 02:01:31,920
promoting the things that we've been
talking about,

2432
02:01:32,520 --> 02:01:35,790
reducing those artificial congregations
of animals,

2433
02:01:36,600 --> 02:01:40,190
implementing a harvest structure to
focus males.

2434
02:01:40,460 --> 02:01:43,010
Okay.
The male focused the most,

2435
02:01:43,240 --> 02:01:48,050
the social group with the highest
prevalence and also kind of what I guess

2436
02:01:48,051 --> 02:01:52,190
I would refer to as hotspot shooting.
When you see a new spark of disease out

2437
02:01:52,191 --> 02:01:54,440
there on the landscape,
get on it.

2438
02:01:54,500 --> 02:01:58,160
Don't allow it to become established.
Your only chance to be successful to

2439
02:01:58,161 --> 02:02:02,060
eliminate disease is very,
very soon before it gets established.

2440
02:02:02,061 --> 02:02:03,080
And Starch,
you know,

2441
02:02:03,081 --> 02:02:06,140
spreading.
So now we're seeing in Wyoming and

2442
02:02:06,141 --> 02:02:09,020
Colorado and Montana,
they're actively talking,

2443
02:02:09,021 --> 02:02:12,380
they're talking to the media,
they're talking to their commissions and

2444
02:02:12,381 --> 02:02:16,100
they're talking about implementing these
regulatory structures at least on an

2445
02:02:16,101 --> 02:02:20,300
experimental basis,
recognizing that doing nothing

2446
02:02:20,780 --> 02:02:23,480
is no longer an option.
And that's one of the things that was

2447
02:02:23,481 --> 02:02:26,720
learned from the Wisconsin experiment,
for lack of a better word.

2448
02:02:27,060 --> 02:02:29,850
Um,
that are our failure.

2449
02:02:29,851 --> 02:02:30,621
I mean,
you know,

2450
02:02:30,621 --> 02:02:32,720
the analogy that I often use is,
you know,

2451
02:02:32,721 --> 02:02:35,300
we had this,
we had this car and it was,

2452
02:02:35,330 --> 02:02:36,380
you know,
pretty decent car.

2453
02:02:36,381 --> 02:02:39,320
That's pretty decent model of how we
were going to control the disease.

2454
02:02:39,710 --> 02:02:41,990
But you know,
they kind of let the oil go out of the

2455
02:02:41,991 --> 02:02:45,260
car and they ran it into,
rented in the ditch and banged it around

2456
02:02:45,261 --> 02:02:46,370
and then brought it up and say,
damn,

2457
02:02:46,371 --> 02:02:51,371
this Ford doesn't run worth a shit.
And if you can't actively tried to

2458
02:02:52,401 --> 02:02:54,470
defeat something and then say it doesn't
work,

2459
02:02:54,860 --> 02:02:56,510
you really have to let it,
you know,

2460
02:02:56,540 --> 02:02:59,060
this is of course,
and in Whiskey,

2461
02:03:00,010 --> 02:03:04,720
what I hope that what's happening and
what I can see is in,

2462
02:03:04,760 --> 02:03:06,470
you know,
in the 15 years that I've learned about

2463
02:03:06,530 --> 02:03:11,060
cwd is that not only is there a lot been
learned about the disease,

2464
02:03:11,150 --> 02:03:15,710
but there's been a lot learned about how
to manage it both on a scientific level

2465
02:03:15,711 --> 02:03:17,330
but on a social level as well.

2466
02:03:17,870 --> 02:03:19,370
And I can tell you,
man,

2467
02:03:19,371 --> 02:03:20,780
if you don't have it,
you don't want it.

2468
02:03:21,560 --> 02:03:22,550
Um,
you know,

2469
02:03:22,551 --> 02:03:26,900
15 years ago I felt,
and there's so much more known now than

2470
02:03:26,901 --> 02:03:28,970
there was 15 years ago.
Um,

2471
02:03:30,220 --> 02:03:31,230
you know,
I feel like we,

2472
02:03:31,460 --> 02:03:33,110
it's not too late in Wisconsin.
I mean,

2473
02:03:33,111 --> 02:03:35,960
we can keep slowing it down and we can
protect the rest of the state.

2474
02:03:36,440 --> 02:03:37,130
But,
um,

2475
02:03:37,130 --> 02:03:40,370
we get a lot of work to do and it takes
a well,

2476
02:03:40,660 --> 02:03:42,540
it,
but it really doesn't take the medicine

2477
02:03:42,541 --> 02:03:44,930
was very bitter,
I think technical information to,

2478
02:03:44,931 --> 02:03:47,960
because I don't think people are really
aware of the extent of this disease or

2479
02:03:47,961 --> 02:03:50,720
the danger of it or all the
ramifications of it.

2480
02:03:50,750 --> 02:03:51,710
I agree.
I agree.

2481
02:03:51,711 --> 02:03:56,711
I'm surprised in my area intelligent
people that I know that are casual

2482
02:03:57,831 --> 02:03:59,270
hunters.
Yeah.

2483
02:03:59,330 --> 02:04:02,660
So it's getting to be deer hunting time
and I'll talk to them what I'm like,

2484
02:04:02,700 --> 02:04:04,010
ah,
they don't really,

2485
02:04:04,011 --> 02:04:04,431
well,
you know,

2486
02:04:04,431 --> 02:04:05,930
they don't know.
They don't know.

2487
02:04:06,250 --> 02:04:07,083
Yeah.
That,

2488
02:04:07,430 --> 02:04:10,190
yeah.
And that really is one of the things.

2489
02:04:10,191 --> 02:04:10,970
So,
you know,

2490
02:04:10,970 --> 02:04:13,740
I appreciate so much the opportunity to
come out here and talk about it.

2491
02:04:13,741 --> 02:04:16,300
And,
and Brian and Mike Samuel,

2492
02:04:16,320 --> 02:04:18,980
um,
are going to come to a regional center

2493
02:04:19,190 --> 02:04:24,190
in September,
which is the capital or a county seat,

2494
02:04:25,191 --> 02:04:26,660
I'm sorry,
of Richland County.

2495
02:04:26,661 --> 02:04:27,470
And we're going to do,
uh,

2496
02:04:27,470 --> 02:04:28,820
another,
uh,

2497
02:04:29,000 --> 02:04:33,020
presentation on chronic wasting disease
and we're advertising it.

2498
02:04:33,040 --> 02:04:33,890
Y,
you know,

2499
02:04:33,891 --> 02:04:37,180
widely and more of that information has
to get an education,

2500
02:04:37,260 --> 02:04:38,730
a big part of Joel.
You're exactly right.

2501
02:04:39,630 --> 02:04:41,100
Yeah.
Just don't think there's enough

2502
02:04:41,790 --> 02:04:46,790
digestible education.
And I think this sort of form is one of

2503
02:04:47,311 --> 02:04:48,820
the most digestible,
oh,

2504
02:04:48,821 --> 02:04:51,070
you have to do is you put it on your car
and drive around,

2505
02:04:51,090 --> 02:04:52,680
you listen to it,
you put it in your headphones and you're

2506
02:04:52,681 --> 02:04:54,480
at the gym,
you'll get this information,

2507
02:04:54,481 --> 02:04:58,080
you'll get an a and M in a way that
you're probably not going to sit down

2508
02:04:58,081 --> 02:05:00,990
and go through these studies.
And I appreciate it as well.

2509
02:05:01,020 --> 02:05:03,270
I mean to,
I'm pretty,

2510
02:05:03,271 --> 02:05:06,210
uh,
not very savvy on social media and

2511
02:05:06,211 --> 02:05:08,760
things like that.
I wasn't even sure what a podcast was

2512
02:05:08,770 --> 02:05:13,170
when Steven Rinella,
you asked me to come on and do meat

2513
02:05:13,171 --> 02:05:16,140
eater.
And so we did that.

2514
02:05:16,200 --> 02:05:17,800
And um,
I,

2515
02:05:18,150 --> 02:05:22,200
I understand now it's been downloaded
like 650,000 times.

2516
02:05:22,500 --> 02:05:24,990
Okay.
Which for a scientist,

2517
02:05:24,991 --> 02:05:27,270
you know,
I've been an author on a lot of peer

2518
02:05:27,271 --> 02:05:29,910
reviewed papers and I can guarantee you
they haven't been read.

2519
02:05:30,210 --> 02:05:34,260
You take a couple zeros off of there and
that's probably the readership on those

2520
02:05:34,261 --> 02:05:36,120
snakes.
So from an impact,

2521
02:05:36,121 --> 02:05:38,100
being able to get a message out to
people,

2522
02:05:38,370 --> 02:05:41,070
this type forum really,
really is helpful.

2523
02:05:41,100 --> 02:05:42,330
And getting it down,
like you say,

2524
02:05:42,331 --> 02:05:46,170
down to a level that hunters can
understand and digestible I think is

2525
02:05:46,171 --> 02:05:47,310
very,
very important.

2526
02:05:47,750 --> 02:05:49,920
Um,
cause I w o he talked about how

2527
02:05:49,921 --> 02:05:52,590
misinformation,
active misinformation to try and,

2528
02:05:52,860 --> 02:05:55,710
you know,
it's not so bad or look over here,

2529
02:05:55,740 --> 02:05:57,390
don't look at this,
look over there.

2530
02:05:57,450 --> 02:05:59,430
You know,
these diversionary tactics are very,

2531
02:05:59,431 --> 02:06:03,090
very successful.
They were very successful with tobacco.

2532
02:06:03,091 --> 02:06:06,030
They were successful with other
scientific endeavors,

2533
02:06:06,060 --> 02:06:08,010
you know,
today and also the simplistic

2534
02:06:08,011 --> 02:06:11,040
perspective that hey look how many deer
get killed by winter.

2535
02:06:11,460 --> 02:06:13,770
You know,
it's way more than cwd stop,

2536
02:06:13,800 --> 02:06:15,380
stop crying wolf.
Yeah.

2537
02:06:15,530 --> 02:06:16,710
So diversionary tactic,

2538
02:06:17,900 --> 02:06:19,910
I'd like to bring up about that.
Um,

2539
02:06:20,720 --> 02:06:25,720
I've killed some big deer and uh,
I get it.

2540
02:06:26,390 --> 02:06:27,890
Guys want it.
People want it.

2541
02:06:27,891 --> 02:06:29,320
Hunters want to do that.
Don't want to kill.

2542
02:06:29,530 --> 02:06:32,080
That's what they look forward to it.
They look forward to hunting season.

2543
02:06:32,081 --> 02:06:33,280
It's only one time a year.

2544
02:06:33,350 --> 02:06:36,700
Yup.
And you get to do that as we're not just

2545
02:06:36,701 --> 02:06:38,010
hunters,
we're conservationists.

2546
02:06:38,040 --> 02:06:42,240
What we do is going to affect the future
and we have an obligation to do what's

2547
02:06:42,241 --> 02:06:44,580
best for the resource and what's best
for the future.

2548
02:06:45,060 --> 02:06:46,980
Um,
and I'll tell you this,

2549
02:06:47,010 --> 02:06:49,620
last year I shot a two and a half year
old buck opening day.

2550
02:06:50,250 --> 02:06:51,083
And,
uh,

2551
02:06:51,210 --> 02:06:56,210
this is a nice little eight pointer and
I celebrated that deer.

2552
02:06:56,490 --> 02:07:00,060
I enjoyed that year.
I remember that moment just as much as

2553
02:07:00,061 --> 02:07:03,450
the 200 inch block that I killed.
It's,

2554
02:07:04,020 --> 02:07:09,020
it's different.
But it concerns me that at times we get

2555
02:07:12,060 --> 02:07:15,750
so wrapped up and I was one of a man,
I feel like a recovered alcoholic

2556
02:07:15,751 --> 02:07:17,790
sometimes about the whole aler thing,
you know,

2557
02:07:17,791 --> 02:07:18,571
like,
hi,

2558
02:07:18,571 --> 02:07:21,480
I'm doug and I used to be a and step
process.

2559
02:07:22,040 --> 02:07:22,531
Well,
and there,

2560
02:07:22,531 --> 02:07:23,640
you know,
there is a part of that.

2561
02:07:23,790 --> 02:07:27,840
Yeah.
But remember what the joy of hunting is

2562
02:07:28,800 --> 02:07:29,640
and the,
the,

2563
02:07:29,760 --> 02:07:34,590
the,
the reason for it and how important it

2564
02:07:34,591 --> 02:07:39,070
is to make sure that that continues into
the future.

2565
02:07:39,820 --> 02:07:42,460
Um,
there've been some folks who really,

2566
02:07:42,520 --> 02:07:44,620
you know,
sounded huge alarms about this and you

2567
02:07:44,621 --> 02:07:45,760
know,
you talked about it a little bit.

2568
02:07:45,761 --> 02:07:46,750
Yeah.
20 years from now,

2569
02:07:46,751 --> 02:07:47,171
it could,
you know,

2570
02:07:47,171 --> 02:07:49,390
it could be,
well it might take a generation or two,

2571
02:07:49,391 --> 02:07:52,150
but it really could become that.
Um,

2572
02:07:52,240 --> 02:07:56,650
I want to be able to eat the meat and I
want to know that in future generations,

2573
02:07:56,680 --> 02:07:58,240
you know,
a hundred years from now and that farm

2574
02:07:58,241 --> 02:07:59,950
is still there and it's still in the
during name,

2575
02:07:59,951 --> 02:08:03,370
it's been in my family for 115 years.
I want to know that a hundred years from

2576
02:08:03,370 --> 02:08:07,510
now that my descendants and their
friends and their family are going to be

2577
02:08:07,511 --> 02:08:12,010
able to come there and still enjoy that
and in order for that to happen,

2578
02:08:12,220 --> 02:08:15,880
just like when I'm managing my oak trees
so that a hundred years from now there's

2579
02:08:15,881 --> 02:08:18,910
going to be those big Oak Tree Sarah
again a hundred years from now,

2580
02:08:19,990 --> 02:08:23,410
we have to do what we need to do now in
order for this

2581
02:08:25,090 --> 02:08:26,950
opportunity,
be there for the future.

2582
02:08:27,040 --> 02:08:31,020
Our hunting heritage is huge.
Not to mention that the financially,

2583
02:08:31,050 --> 02:08:35,230
that the economics of of deer hunting in
a place like Wisconsin,

2584
02:08:35,231 --> 02:08:38,530
there's over 650,000 people that hunt
deer.

2585
02:08:38,950 --> 02:08:43,950
They pump in excess of $1 billion every
year into the economy of the state of

2586
02:08:43,991 --> 02:08:48,130
Wisconsin surrounded by hunting.
If we put that on a national basis,

2587
02:08:48,131 --> 02:08:52,030
there's millions of hunters and more
billions of dollars spent.

2588
02:08:52,031 --> 02:08:56,320
So it's not a small thing when you think
about,

2589
02:08:56,370 --> 02:08:57,790
you know,
the economics of hunting.

2590
02:08:57,791 --> 02:09:00,520
But the heritage of hunting is very,
very important.

2591
02:09:00,521 --> 02:09:00,970
I mean,
I,

2592
02:09:00,970 --> 02:09:02,840
I've been hunting my whole life.
Yeah.

2593
02:09:03,210 --> 02:09:04,280
Yeah.
Now I hunt.

2594
02:09:04,290 --> 02:09:07,930
Uh,
primarily one county was to him and you

2595
02:09:07,940 --> 02:09:09,490
know,
cwd has coming.

2596
02:09:10,030 --> 02:09:13,900
I'd say I'm sitting in my tree stands
three years ago and Cwt is in the next

2597
02:09:13,901 --> 02:09:16,450
county.
Over two years ago,

2598
02:09:16,480 --> 02:09:19,300
the first cwt positive deer in Crawford
County,

2599
02:09:19,301 --> 02:09:21,730
Wisconsin was detected,
um,

2600
02:09:21,731 --> 02:09:25,540
less than two miles to the southwest of
the tree that I'm sitting in.

2601
02:09:26,200 --> 02:09:29,680
Last year,
cwd had been detected in another,

2602
02:09:29,681 --> 02:09:31,930
in a secondary in Crawford County.
This time,

2603
02:09:31,931 --> 02:09:34,930
one mile to the northeast of where my
tree stand is.

2604
02:09:35,620 --> 02:09:38,680
I find myself looking at deer
differently.

2605
02:09:39,280 --> 02:09:42,310
I'm looking for those subtle queues,
a disease,

2606
02:09:42,311 --> 02:09:46,230
and it,
they say it's changing the experience I

2607
02:09:46,250 --> 02:09:48,250
get.
I get calls pretty regularly from,

2608
02:09:48,280 --> 02:09:51,220
from hunters who are like,
you know,

2609
02:09:51,520 --> 02:09:54,190
really it's a coin flip out there.

2610
02:09:54,690 --> 02:09:58,390
I'm not so sure I want to hunt there
anymore or no,

2611
02:09:59,100 --> 02:10:01,350
because I'm on the deer advisory
committee.

2612
02:10:01,770 --> 02:10:04,590
A group of hunters came in who bought
land south of us,

2613
02:10:04,620 --> 02:10:05,453
you know,
uh,

2614
02:10:05,640 --> 02:10:09,170
20 miles south of us in a significant
portion and they're doing,

2615
02:10:09,270 --> 02:10:09,930
uh,
they were,

2616
02:10:09,930 --> 02:10:12,540
they bought it to manage it for,
for bigger box,

2617
02:10:13,570 --> 02:10:15,930
um,
and population and all of that.

2618
02:10:15,960 --> 02:10:20,960
They came into the county deer advisory
committee and talk to us about what

2619
02:10:21,121 --> 02:10:24,840
they're doing.
They shot 43 deer on that property last

2620
02:10:24,840 --> 02:10:27,810
year.
All of the box tested,

2621
02:10:27,840 --> 02:10:30,600
all the antler bucks tested positive for
Cwd,

2622
02:10:31,430 --> 02:10:34,310
um,
about 25%

2623
02:10:34,310 --> 02:10:39,310
of the dose and some of the Fonz.
So a doe fawn who as cw who has cwd and

2624
02:10:42,120 --> 02:10:44,300
she's going to be clinical and die in
two years,

2625
02:10:44,330 --> 02:10:45,560
she's never going to have funds of her
own.

2626
02:10:45,561 --> 02:10:48,530
That's the population issue.
But what I,

2627
02:10:49,220 --> 02:10:50,810
you know,
I hope those guys are listening.

2628
02:10:50,960 --> 02:10:54,200
Um,
what I plotted about them is what

2629
02:10:54,201 --> 02:10:58,850
they've done is really worked with
bringing in other people and I'm going

2630
02:10:58,851 --> 02:11:00,680
to do the same on our place.
Um,

2631
02:11:00,740 --> 02:11:03,260
bringing in more people to hunt,
um,

2632
02:11:04,130 --> 02:11:06,770
to,
to take more deer and to do what they

2633
02:11:06,771 --> 02:11:08,950
can manage it because they saw it.
Well the,

2634
02:11:09,280 --> 02:11:11,270
and what,
they're not seeing big old bucks anymore

2635
02:11:11,390 --> 02:11:13,160
cause they're dead.
They're dying,

2636
02:11:13,670 --> 02:11:15,410
they're finding them,
but they're finding them dead.

2637
02:11:16,220 --> 02:11:20,540
We've seen that in and a Wyoming in,
I mean what we look at,

2638
02:11:20,541 --> 02:11:23,300
the longterm impacts had disease.
And I talked a little bit about

2639
02:11:23,301 --> 02:11:25,970
population impacts driving population
down.

2640
02:11:26,540 --> 02:11:30,230
The other you're saying we would
identify is changes in that demographic

2641
02:11:30,231 --> 02:11:33,790
structure.
So you know,

2642
02:11:34,310 --> 02:11:36,470
when you were hunting for the big
antlered deer,

2643
02:11:36,471 --> 02:11:40,970
you're looking for animals that are four
or five years old and mature over mature

2644
02:11:40,971 --> 02:11:45,971
animals in an area where cwt as
established at high prevalence levels,

2645
02:11:46,820 --> 02:11:49,730
those animals are not going to exist or
what would be extremely,

2646
02:11:49,731 --> 02:11:50,990
extremely rare.
They're rare.

2647
02:11:50,991 --> 02:11:53,030
Now,
here's an example of a,

2648
02:11:53,110 --> 02:11:57,620
a real large ranch out in Wyoming and
there's about a hundred thousand acres

2649
02:11:57,621 --> 02:12:02,000
and eight managed historically,
exclusively for these over mature mule

2650
02:12:02,001 --> 02:12:03,680
deer.
You know the ones with the antlers,

2651
02:12:03,710 --> 02:12:05,780
you know like that monstrous muled
there.

2652
02:12:06,500 --> 02:12:09,350
Even in the good times,
they probably killed maybe three of them

2653
02:12:09,351 --> 02:12:10,670
a year,
something like that.

2654
02:12:10,671 --> 02:12:14,810
On that vast acreage because you know
there's a lot of sources of mortality.

2655
02:12:15,960 --> 02:12:20,480
They're not anymore because you,
you know those deer living that long.

2656
02:12:21,130 --> 02:12:23,380
I think about it at math question,
math quiz for,

2657
02:12:23,381 --> 02:12:24,560
for,
for during here.

2658
02:12:24,800 --> 02:12:27,890
So in this population with super high
prevalence,

2659
02:12:28,460 --> 02:12:33,380
so let's say at 18 at 18 months of age,
yearling deer,

2660
02:12:33,440 --> 02:12:35,890
let's say they have 20% prevalence,
and we have that,

2661
02:12:36,150 --> 02:12:41,150
we demonstrated that at two and a half,
it's probably 30% prevalence at three

2662
02:12:41,451 --> 02:12:43,090
and a half and four and a half and above
it's,

2663
02:12:43,170 --> 02:12:48,170
it's close to 40 45 50% prevalence.
So this is a two year disease,

2664
02:12:48,651 --> 02:12:53,090
right?
So half your prevalence dies every year.

2665
02:12:53,960 --> 02:12:58,960
So if you have 20% prevalence,
half of those deer are going to be dead

2666
02:12:59,061 --> 02:13:01,070
the next year,
half the year after that.

2667
02:13:01,310 --> 02:13:03,830
Okay.
So over time you would expect these

2668
02:13:03,831 --> 02:13:07,340
cohorts to diminish.
So the math question is in that

2669
02:13:07,341 --> 02:13:10,730
population,
how many five year old bucks are there?

2670
02:13:10,731 --> 02:13:13,160
Because disease penetrance grows over
time.

2671
02:13:14,300 --> 02:13:17,110
The answer's not meant.
It's not a,

2672
02:13:17,300 --> 02:13:20,330
I'm supposed to.
It's a sound.

2673
02:13:20,331 --> 02:13:21,650
The alarm.
Yeah,

2674
02:13:22,190 --> 02:13:22,840
yeah.
No.

2675
02:13:22,840 --> 02:13:24,010
And that,
you know,

2676
02:13:24,020 --> 02:13:25,760
that really is the case and it's,
it's,

2677
02:13:25,761 --> 02:13:27,420
uh,
I,

2678
02:13:27,430 --> 02:13:28,263
I,
you know,

2679
02:13:29,270 --> 02:13:31,530
again,
that's why I wanted to bring along,

2680
02:13:31,531 --> 02:13:31,980
because he's

2681
02:13:31,980 --> 02:13:35,490
going to provide the science and I'm
going to try to break it down to,

2682
02:13:36,330 --> 02:13:37,840
you know,
Doug's level and,

2683
02:13:37,950 --> 02:13:39,240
and hopefully that,
you know,

2684
02:13:39,270 --> 02:13:41,460
folks can understand it and I know I get
emotional about it,

2685
02:13:41,461 --> 02:13:41,970
but,
you know,

2686
02:13:41,970 --> 02:13:43,790
part of it is,
yeah,

2687
02:13:43,800 --> 02:13:48,300
well my dad would be 94 years old today
and he's the guy that I started deer

2688
02:13:48,301 --> 02:13:49,560
hunting with.
You know,

2689
02:13:49,561 --> 02:13:54,360
he died a couple of years ago and I,
he grew up with that farm,

2690
02:13:54,920 --> 02:13:57,580
you know,
it was my great grandfather's farm in

2691
02:13:58,170 --> 02:13:59,910
that area,
in the driftless area.

2692
02:13:59,911 --> 02:14:02,820
And you've heard me talked about the
driftless area before and how important

2693
02:14:02,821 --> 02:14:05,850
that area is to me.
And this is a big part of that area.

2694
02:14:06,480 --> 02:14:11,480
It is an emotional thing for me,
which is why I then look at the science

2695
02:14:12,420 --> 02:14:15,030
and what can we do about this?
And I think about,

2696
02:14:15,810 --> 02:14:17,400
you know,
I think about Elva Leopold,

2697
02:14:17,420 --> 02:14:18,960
what leopold do right now.

2698
02:14:19,230 --> 02:14:20,670
I mean,
what would he be thinking about this?

2699
02:14:20,671 --> 02:14:21,391
You know,
what am I old man?

2700
02:14:21,391 --> 02:14:22,920
I'd be thinking about this,
you know,

2701
02:14:23,310 --> 02:14:26,340
I know what my dad would be saying.
He always sat my,

2702
02:14:26,520 --> 02:14:30,780
my antler thing was bullshit.
Every time he'd see a bucket on the

2703
02:14:30,781 --> 02:14:31,770
trail,
chemical shooter,

2704
02:14:32,190 --> 02:14:33,450
you just,
he just like,

2705
02:14:33,690 --> 02:14:35,340
he was just an old school buck hunter,
man.

2706
02:14:35,341 --> 02:14:36,860
He did an antler on it.
You shot it.

2707
02:14:38,790 --> 02:14:41,400
So all those things are in my head as I
think about this.

2708
02:14:41,970 --> 02:14:42,803
And,
uh,

2709
02:14:42,930 --> 02:14:43,441
you know,
it's,

2710
02:14:43,441 --> 02:14:47,850
it's the emotion's important and I get
the emotion part from all of these,

2711
02:14:47,851 --> 02:14:48,900
these,
these folks.

2712
02:14:49,440 --> 02:14:51,380
Um,
and I understand that some of them want

2713
02:14:51,381 --> 02:14:52,360
to kill big bucks.
And,

2714
02:14:52,440 --> 02:14:54,990
and you know,
maybe because I have killed a couple of

2715
02:14:54,991 --> 02:14:56,490
big ones,
that's it's not as important.

2716
02:14:56,491 --> 02:14:57,780
Maybe.
Maybe it has something to do with being

2717
02:14:57,781 --> 02:15:00,930
60 years old and maybe you understand
the consequences.

2718
02:15:01,600 --> 02:15:04,450
This is a real serious issue.
Forget about the ego of killing a big

2719
02:15:04,451 --> 02:15:08,140
buck or you know,
this desire to achieve something that's

2720
02:15:08,141 --> 02:15:10,090
more difficult than shooting a young
one.

2721
02:15:10,420 --> 02:15:11,910
There's more at stake here.
Yeah.

2722
02:15:11,960 --> 02:15:16,630
So you brought up an interesting,
what would leah do and he,

2723
02:15:16,660 --> 02:15:20,410
I mean
this disciple,

2724
02:15:20,460 --> 02:15:22,410
you know,
father of modern wildlife ecology

2725
02:15:22,420 --> 02:15:27,420
started the first program of Wildlife
College at University of Wisconsin in

2726
02:15:27,551 --> 02:15:32,551
the 1940s populations of deer in the
northern part of Wisconsin.

2727
02:15:34,301 --> 02:15:38,650
We're growing by leaps and bounds and
they were dramatically changing the

2728
02:15:38,651 --> 02:15:40,990
landscape.
PM denuding the landscape,

2729
02:15:41,020 --> 02:15:43,730
you know,
eating eastern white cedar and deer in

2730
02:15:43,731 --> 02:15:46,900
northern latitudes tend to yard together
in the wintertime.

2731
02:15:47,500 --> 02:15:52,500
And so leopold knew that this was
deleterious to the longterm viability of

2732
02:15:53,561 --> 02:15:56,920
that ecosystem.
He took people out,

2733
02:15:57,070 --> 02:16:01,810
landowners out in hunters out into these
deer yards in the spring to show them

2734
02:16:01,811 --> 02:16:04,150
how there was nothing to eat within
reach.

2735
02:16:04,180 --> 02:16:08,350
Of a deer on a hind feet and there were
bodies of dead deer that it stopped

2736
02:16:08,351 --> 02:16:12,670
through the wintertime in order to
demonstrate to them the consequences of

2737
02:16:12,671 --> 02:16:15,490
mismanagement if deere hurts.
So he,

2738
02:16:15,670 --> 02:16:20,080
he was a real proponent of showing
people the results of doing things the

2739
02:16:20,081 --> 02:16:22,540
wrong way and education.
So I think,

2740
02:16:22,541 --> 02:16:23,920
yeah,
it comes back,

2741
02:16:24,030 --> 02:16:25,750
it's what we're trying to do.
Not saying that,

2742
02:16:26,060 --> 02:16:28,660
yeah,
we're leopold in or anything like that,

2743
02:16:28,750 --> 02:16:32,670
but education,
getting information out,

2744
02:16:32,671 --> 02:16:35,950
getting accurate information out as
maybe one of the biggest things we can

2745
02:16:35,951 --> 02:16:38,320
do.
I think you guys did down here today.

2746
02:16:38,350 --> 02:16:40,210
So thank you.
Thank you for being here,

2747
02:16:40,211 --> 02:16:42,600
Brian.
Thank you doug for organizing that

2748
02:16:43,310 --> 02:16:45,550
together.
I'm really happy we got a chance to talk

2749
02:16:45,551 --> 02:16:49,720
and scare the shit out of me.
Thanks for the opportunity.

2750
02:16:49,750 --> 02:16:50,860
My pleasure.
Thank you guys.

2751
02:16:50,861 --> 02:16:51,220
Thank you.
