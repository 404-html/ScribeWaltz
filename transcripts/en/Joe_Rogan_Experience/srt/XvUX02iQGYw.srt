00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:04,390
Hello Freak bitches.
I want queefs.

2
00:00:04,450 --> 00:00:06,610
I don't break for queefs.
You don't like,

3
00:00:06,650 --> 00:00:09,650
you're fucking going and you hear that
and they sort of want to stop fucking

4
00:00:09,651 --> 00:00:11,500
right for it to be there.
That's like I'm driving on the highway

5
00:00:11,501 --> 00:00:12,334
and someone goes,
hey,

6
00:00:12,490 --> 00:00:13,390
okay.
Let me ask you this.

7
00:00:13,420 --> 00:00:15,190
Do you eat pussy when they're on their
period?

8
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:17,050
Uh,
I used to,

9
00:00:17,051 --> 00:00:18,340
but as I got older,
no.

10
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:20,350
Hmm.
I don't give a fuck.

11
00:00:20,410 --> 00:00:23,380
I used to fuck chicks with Shane a lot.
And how dare you?

12
00:00:23,980 --> 00:00:26,260
We would accidentally touch dicks
sometimes.

13
00:00:26,261 --> 00:00:28,210
Like one time I was just like the
operation game.

14
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:31,570
I thought it was fucking a girl in her
ass and it went into her cunt and

15
00:00:31,571 --> 00:00:36,280
actually went into his condom inside.
I'm looking down at her how looses his

16
00:00:36,281 --> 00:00:36,881
cotton?
What is it?

17
00:00:36,881 --> 00:00:39,490
A fucking trash bag.
I was harder than making sense.

18
00:00:39,870 --> 00:00:41,820
At least resistance.
So I'm looking down at it,

19
00:00:41,860 --> 00:00:44,110
man.
I swear to God I'm got inside his

20
00:00:44,111 --> 00:00:45,080
condom.
Yup.

21
00:00:45,130 --> 00:00:48,160
So using the condom ever believes me.
But this container so that you guys

22
00:00:48,161 --> 00:00:50,950
could rub dicks together.
But that wasn't the plan.

23
00:00:51,010 --> 00:00:52,330
But I was,
I was like,

24
00:00:52,331 --> 00:00:55,930
I'm fucking this bitch his ass.
And I looked down and I see an asshole

25
00:00:56,260 --> 00:00:58,120
and I'm like,
how many assholes does this woman that

26
00:00:59,110 --> 00:01:00,070
I'm in?
At least one of them.

27
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:02,500
And then I reached down and I feel a
condom.

28
00:01:02,501 --> 00:01:04,870
How drunk were you guys?
Not Drunk at all.

29
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:07,030
Why did you not know where you're
putting your Dick?

30
00:01:07,031 --> 00:01:08,760
Don't you look?
What are you looking at?

31
00:01:08,780 --> 00:01:09,360
You,
you're fucking,

32
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:11,590
you're on the ass.
You're pushing and pushing and pushing

33
00:01:11,620 --> 00:01:14,120
and then you sort of feel,
and then it slipped.

34
00:01:14,140 --> 00:01:15,190
Yeah.
So you go,

35
00:01:15,220 --> 00:01:16,460
oh,
that must have gone in the hole.

36
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:18,640
The one that was pushing again,
girl doing the whole time.

37
00:01:18,670 --> 00:01:23,670
Calling
like Donald Sutherland in invasion of

38
00:01:23,681 --> 00:01:24,900
the body snatchers.
Yeah.

39
00:01:25,150 --> 00:01:27,730
Well she's got to Dixon in Vaginas.
She's fucking,

40
00:01:27,820 --> 00:01:29,650
oh,
huster listen,

41
00:01:29,651 --> 00:01:31,810
she was from Malta.
I hate to wrap this up on a,

42
00:01:31,900 --> 00:01:35,540
on a high note like that,
but we're out of time story.

43
00:01:36,550 --> 00:01:37,241
So anyway,
I've,

44
00:01:37,241 --> 00:01:38,290
I've,
I've reached down,

45
00:01:38,410 --> 00:01:39,530
I go,
I didn't have a condom on,

46
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:42,400
I have a condom on and then I pulled out
and I busted not on her butt.

47
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:44,650
And uh,
if people go,

48
00:01:44,651 --> 00:01:47,050
but you touched a dick,
but when you're doing that kind of

49
00:01:47,051 --> 00:01:49,450
stuff,
it's like two mobsters digging a hole

50
00:01:49,451 --> 00:01:52,510
for a body and their shovels clink.
Like you don't fucking know

51
00:01:52,770 --> 00:01:54,030
where you're at work.
Right.

52
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:54,953
I understand.
Yeah.

53
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:56,970
I still,
I want him to get you wrap that up nice

54
00:01:56,971 --> 00:01:59,670
and tight.
Do you know I had a revelation the other

55
00:01:59,670 --> 00:02:01,620
day when it came to movies?
Uh,

56
00:02:01,621 --> 00:02:03,960
I went to see the Martian.
It was pretty good.

57
00:02:04,890 --> 00:02:06,990
Interesting.
But the problem is,

58
00:02:07,530 --> 00:02:10,620
the problem with that movie is,
you know he's going to live,

59
00:02:10,890 --> 00:02:12,480
you know,
he's gonna make it so it's like someone

60
00:02:12,481 --> 00:02:15,330
gave you a spoiler alert before you even
got to the movie.

61
00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:16,441
It's like,
oh,

62
00:02:16,441 --> 00:02:20,370
is he going to die on Mars?
Am I paying money to watch two hours of

63
00:02:20,371 --> 00:02:22,200
him and he's going to die on Mars?
Get the fuck out of here.

64
00:02:22,201 --> 00:02:24,090
Everybody knows he's not going to die on
Mars.

65
00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:29,540
But the revelation was there's,
there's too many movies and like even

66
00:02:31,201 --> 00:02:34,530
really awesome movies like sicario
supposed to be pretty bad ass.

67
00:02:34,710 --> 00:02:38,190
We couldn't,
that's the new Benicio Del Toro movie.

68
00:02:38,191 --> 00:02:40,290
It's supposed to be pretty bad ass,
but we couldn't get a ticket to that

69
00:02:40,291 --> 00:02:41,300
one.
Um,

70
00:02:41,460 --> 00:02:43,020
in time,
uh,

71
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:45,060
we,
we were sold out so we went with the

72
00:02:45,061 --> 00:02:46,150
Martian.
Um,

73
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:49,410
but the point is these movies never
stop.

74
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:52,770
Every week there's new ones and they
don't go away.

75
00:02:53,130 --> 00:02:56,970
Like the old ones don't stop being
around like you can go watch them too.

76
00:02:56,971 --> 00:03:00,400
It's like there's too many of them.
Like I was thinking about all the

77
00:03:00,401 --> 00:03:04,390
different movies just on itunes and
Netflix and I was scrolling through them

78
00:03:04,391 --> 00:03:05,780
and I started thinking like,
this is a,

79
00:03:06,130 --> 00:03:10,240
this is a neverending equation.
Like it just keeps getting tacked onto

80
00:03:10,241 --> 00:03:12,820
it.
We live in the epicenter of where it's

81
00:03:12,821 --> 00:03:15,660
created.
It's all around here and it's,

82
00:03:15,830 --> 00:03:19,450
it's very strange because the body of
work just never stops.

83
00:03:19,451 --> 00:03:21,760
Like he used to be when I was a kid.

84
00:03:22,210 --> 00:03:25,600
When a good movie came out,
you would go to see that fucking movie.

85
00:03:25,630 --> 00:03:30,270
Like Star Wars.
I saw star wars 13 times and I was in

86
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:33,970
nothing compared to the real geeks.
Like there's,

87
00:03:34,010 --> 00:03:37,270
there was like,
it was a big deal back then to see how

88
00:03:37,271 --> 00:03:41,080
many times you could see a movie.
Like you couldn't run a movie long

89
00:03:41,081 --> 00:03:45,580
enough to see for someone to see it 13
times now because there's new ones,

90
00:03:45,730 --> 00:03:48,730
there's new ones come in.
We got to get this fucking piece of shit

91
00:03:48,870 --> 00:03:51,100
out of the theater.
You would never have a movie like star

92
00:03:51,101 --> 00:03:52,810
wars.
It played over and over and over and

93
00:03:52,811 --> 00:03:56,350
over and over and over again.
And if star wars came out today,

94
00:03:56,890 --> 00:04:00,880
people would shit right in its mouth.
It's,

95
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:04,030
it's weird.
That is to me in my childhood,

96
00:04:04,031 --> 00:04:07,930
one of the greatest movies of all time
when I was a kid and that movie came

97
00:04:07,931 --> 00:04:10,810
out,
I remember when Obi wan Kenobi was

98
00:04:10,811 --> 00:04:12,810
talking to Luke Skywalker and,
uh,

99
00:04:12,830 --> 00:04:14,020
they were in the sand.

100
00:04:14,020 --> 00:04:16,360
I was like,
this is the greatest thing I've ever

101
00:04:16,361 --> 00:04:19,090
seen in my life.
This is amazing.

102
00:04:19,270 --> 00:04:23,230
This guy's in space and he's got an Obi
wan Kenobi is going to teach them how to

103
00:04:23,231 --> 00:04:24,210
be a jet.
I,

104
00:04:24,310 --> 00:04:26,620
ah,
this is the greatest movie ever.

105
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:28,540
I remember it couldn't have been more
perfect.

106
00:04:28,750 --> 00:04:30,190
I remember seeing that movie and
thinking,

107
00:04:30,191 --> 00:04:33,820
this movie is fucking perfect.
Now you go watch and you're like,

108
00:04:33,850 --> 00:04:36,100
oh my God,
it's such a clunky Turd.

109
00:04:36,550 --> 00:04:39,610
It's clunky.
The special effects look like shit.

110
00:04:39,730 --> 00:04:41,280
Why is Darth vader evil?
Does he,

111
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:43,030
doesn't,
does not even a reason why he's evil.

112
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:45,610
He's just evil.
What does he get when he takes over the

113
00:04:45,611 --> 00:04:48,700
world is even get pussy is even going to
get any pussy in space.

114
00:04:48,970 --> 00:04:52,750
He know he's just building some giant
star that can blow up planets.

115
00:04:52,930 --> 00:04:55,000
Really?
This is so dumb.

116
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:56,460
Like it's so dumb.
Oh,

117
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:58,420
uses the dark side.
Oh,

118
00:04:58,421 --> 00:05:01,210
not the dark side.
It's so fucking dumb.

119
00:05:01,350 --> 00:05:03,730
And it's puppets.
It's like kermit the frog and the

120
00:05:03,731 --> 00:05:07,080
skywalker.
But it's day like if you judge it in the

121
00:05:07,081 --> 00:05:10,260
context of its day,
it's one of the all time classic films.

122
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:13,560
It's just,
there's so many more now and they're

123
00:05:13,561 --> 00:05:16,020
better.
They say you are a fighter.

124
00:05:16,021 --> 00:05:18,030
Power example,
you got to opponent,

125
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:22,040
but this time the opponent is yourself.
Mm.

126
00:05:22,380 --> 00:05:23,310
And,
uh,

127
00:05:23,700 --> 00:05:28,680
and you know it from the inside and you
feel it from the inside and it makes you

128
00:05:28,681 --> 00:05:30,300
happy.
It makes you strong and makes you

129
00:05:30,301 --> 00:05:33,730
healthy.
And this is what we have lost from the

130
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:37,980
nature and now it's back.
So,

131
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:41,610
so in a sense,
what you've done is you tapped into

132
00:05:41,611 --> 00:05:45,480
something extremely primal by dealing
with one of the most primal elements of

133
00:05:45,481 --> 00:05:46,710
all,
which is cold.

134
00:05:46,790 --> 00:05:48,200
Yes.
So the cold,

135
00:05:48,201 --> 00:05:49,220
like the,
the,

136
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:52,220
in the vice documentary,
I thought that was really fascinating.

137
00:05:52,230 --> 00:05:56,010
You said cold is your God.
Yes it is.

138
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:58,580
Yeah.
If I had a teach,

139
00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:00,640
I've never had a teacher.
That's it.

140
00:06:00,830 --> 00:06:01,940
That's amazing.
I know.

141
00:06:01,950 --> 00:06:06,800
Goudreau or mentor or Sifu or anything
like that.

142
00:06:07,790 --> 00:06:09,500
The cold.
That's my teacher.

143
00:06:09,730 --> 00:06:12,260
That's my God.
I've been dodging the colts and tells a

144
00:06:12,261 --> 00:06:14,720
little kid.
It's amazing.

145
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:18,560
You just felt compelled to jump into
that.

146
00:06:18,620 --> 00:06:19,680
Yes,
absolutely.

147
00:06:19,890 --> 00:06:22,640
And what was,
when you were saying this to people,

148
00:06:22,641 --> 00:06:25,820
when you're 31 years old and you're
telling people I can control my immune

149
00:06:25,821 --> 00:06:26,331
system,
they,

150
00:06:26,331 --> 00:06:28,100
they must've been like,
you're out of your fucking mind.

151
00:06:28,350 --> 00:06:30,950
Look at this guys jumping in the
freezing water and he says he can

152
00:06:30,951 --> 00:06:34,940
control his immune system.
How did you convince people to the point

153
00:06:35,330 --> 00:06:39,680
that you got actual scientists to
measure your blood?

154
00:06:39,950 --> 00:06:44,950
Do legitimate scientific studies on you?
Like what was it your accomplishments

155
00:06:45,501 --> 00:06:49,130
like you went for people that don't know
you,

156
00:06:49,170 --> 00:06:51,710
you did a bunch of really unbelievable
tasks.

157
00:06:51,711 --> 00:06:54,350
You,
you climbed everest in your shorts.

158
00:06:54,860 --> 00:06:56,420
Um,
did you have shoes on when you climbed

159
00:06:56,421 --> 00:06:57,320
everest?
Yes,

160
00:06:57,321 --> 00:06:59,240
I had to with spikes,
spikes,

161
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:00,420
climbing.
Slippery,

162
00:07:00,700 --> 00:07:01,533
right?

163
00:07:01,740 --> 00:07:06,190
Add a random Americans.
No showed on that.

164
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:13,100
I think I go buy clothes.
It's insane because it's like you are

165
00:07:13,501 --> 00:07:14,520
not challenging,
uh,

166
00:07:14,521 --> 00:07:18,480
nature you can go up with,
with their car as well.

167
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:21,360
And then you go up Everest,
right?

168
00:07:21,390 --> 00:07:26,390
Anything artificial you use in nature
doesn't make you having the right

169
00:07:27,511 --> 00:07:31,620
connection with nature.
And what I wanted to challenge in all

170
00:07:31,621 --> 00:07:35,250
the challenges I did,
like marathons beyond the polar circle

171
00:07:35,251 --> 00:07:38,940
in midwinter and short,
but also in the heat of the desert

172
00:07:38,941 --> 00:07:43,120
without drinking or hanging by one
finger on,

173
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:46,470
I want to half Columbia,
like a mile and up in the air.

174
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:50,040
What it in winter time,
you hung up by one finger.

175
00:07:50,041 --> 00:07:51,510
A mile up in the air.
Yes.

176
00:07:51,511 --> 00:07:54,350
Yes.
Where was this alternate Holland's her

177
00:07:54,351 --> 00:07:58,020
between two hot air balloons and then
climbing between them.

178
00:07:58,740 --> 00:08:00,030
And then there was a,
you know,

179
00:08:00,060 --> 00:08:00,900
a,
a thing,

180
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:03,360
uh,
a device I could kind of put it on with

181
00:08:03,361 --> 00:08:04,280
one finger.
Yes.

182
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:07,020
How long has your hanger for a 25
seconds.

183
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:12,390
Five seconds with one finger.
And in winter time,

184
00:08:12,860 --> 00:08:14,130
winter time,
you know,

185
00:08:14,131 --> 00:08:19,131
you lose control when the blood becomes
cold or in the hands you lose control.

186
00:08:19,620 --> 00:08:22,710
So that was the challenge.
It's mind over matter.

187
00:08:23,190 --> 00:08:26,490
And I wanted to show that in all the
challenges,

188
00:08:26,820 --> 00:08:31,820
the adaptive power of ours is enormous.
But as we are not stimulating or using

189
00:08:34,351 --> 00:08:38,730
that anymore,
you get a neglected body and become sick

190
00:08:38,731 --> 00:08:43,410
or half in its potency.
And so very logic.

191
00:08:43,780 --> 00:08:47,170
So the,
the powers that our body has,

192
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:51,760
the untapped power is that we probably
had for millennia dealing with the cold,

193
00:08:51,761 --> 00:08:53,470
dealing with the heat,
dealing with adversity,

194
00:08:53,471 --> 00:08:56,700
dealing with struggle.
All those powers are not being tapped

195
00:08:56,701 --> 00:08:57,840
into.
So because of that,

196
00:08:57,841 --> 00:08:59,760
the body just atrophies.
And we don't,

197
00:08:59,790 --> 00:09:01,440
it doesn't know what to do like
yourself.

198
00:09:01,530 --> 00:09:02,363
Exactly.

199
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:12,020
Yeah.
