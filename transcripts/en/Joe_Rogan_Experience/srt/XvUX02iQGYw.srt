1
00:00:01,030 --> 00:00:04,390
Hello Freak bitches.
I want queefs.

2
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:06,430
I don't break for queets,
you know,

3
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:09,070
like you're fucking going and you hear
that and they sort of want to stop

4
00:00:09,340 --> 00:00:11,500
fucking.
That's like I'm driving on the highway

5
00:00:11,501 --> 00:00:12,334
and someone goes,
Hey,

6
00:00:12,490 --> 00:00:13,390
okay,
let me ask you this.

7
00:00:13,420 --> 00:00:15,220
Did he push you when they're on their
period?

8
00:00:15,700 --> 00:00:17,050
Uh,
I used to,

9
00:00:17,051 --> 00:00:18,330
but as I got older,
no,

10
00:00:19,570 --> 00:00:22,060
don't give a fuck.
I used to fuck chicks with Shane a lot.

11
00:00:22,210 --> 00:00:25,720
And how dare you.
We would accidentally touch dicks

12
00:00:25,721 --> 00:00:27,160
sometimes.
Like one time I was just like,

13
00:00:27,161 --> 00:00:29,500
that operation game.
I thought I was fucking a girl in her

14
00:00:29,501 --> 00:00:34,501
ass and it went into her current and
actually went into his condom inside.

15
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:36,610
I'm looking down at her.
How looses his condom?

16
00:00:36,611 --> 00:00:37,960
What is it?
A fucking trash bag.

17
00:00:37,990 --> 00:00:39,490
I was harder.
They make sense,

18
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:42,140
at least resistance.
So I'm looking down at Man,

19
00:00:42,670 --> 00:00:44,560
I swear to God on got inside his condom.

20
00:00:44,830 --> 00:00:46,750
Yep.
So using the condom ever believes me

21
00:00:46,751 --> 00:00:49,150
about this container so that you guys
could rub dicks together.

22
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:51,410
But that wasn't the plan,
but I was,

23
00:00:51,610 --> 00:00:53,620
I was like,
I'm fucking bitches ass.

24
00:00:53,650 --> 00:00:56,770
And I looked down and I see an asshole
and I'm like,

25
00:00:56,771 --> 00:00:59,340
how many apples does this woman assuming
I'm in,

26
00:00:59,350 --> 00:01:02,020
at least one of them.
And then I reached down and I feel a

27
00:01:02,021 --> 00:01:03,970
condom.
How drunk were you guys?

28
00:01:04,030 --> 00:01:05,180
Not Drunk at all.
Well,

29
00:01:05,240 --> 00:01:07,030
how did you not know where you're
putting your Dick?

30
00:01:07,031 --> 00:01:10,030
Don't you look?
What are you looking at on the ass?

31
00:01:10,031 --> 00:01:13,540
You're pushing and pushing and pushing
and then you sort of feel that it

32
00:01:13,541 --> 00:01:15,190
slipped.
So you'd go,

33
00:01:15,191 --> 00:01:16,570
oh,
that must have gone into a hole.

34
00:01:16,571 --> 00:01:18,640
The one that was pushing this girl doing
the whole time.

35
00:01:18,650 --> 00:01:22,900
Calling with
Donald Sutherland.

36
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:24,580
Yeah.
Invasion of the body snatchers.

37
00:01:25,050 --> 00:01:26,930
Well,
she's got to Dixon and vaginas.

38
00:01:26,931 --> 00:01:29,650
She's fucking hoster.
Listen,

39
00:01:29,651 --> 00:01:31,810
she was from Malta.
I hate to wrap this up on a,

40
00:01:31,900 --> 00:01:36,160
on a high note like that.
But we're out of time at the end of the

41
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:37,080
story.
So anyway,

42
00:01:37,081 --> 00:01:37,430
I've,
I've,

43
00:01:37,430 --> 00:01:38,740
I've reached down,
I go,

44
00:01:38,741 --> 00:01:41,500
I didn't have a condom on and I have a
condom on and then I pull out and I

45
00:01:41,501 --> 00:01:44,650
busted out on her butt and uh,
people go,

46
00:01:44,651 --> 00:01:47,050
but you touched a dick.
But when you're doing that kind of

47
00:01:47,051 --> 00:01:49,450
stuff,
it's like two mobsters digging a hole

48
00:01:49,451 --> 00:01:52,480
for a body and their shovels clink.
Like you don't fucking know

49
00:01:52,770 --> 00:01:54,020
where you're at work.
Right?

50
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:55,470
I understand.
I see.

51
00:01:55,490 --> 00:01:56,970
I want them to get you wrap that up.
Nice.

52
00:01:57,030 --> 00:01:59,520
Tight.
Do you know I had a revelation the other

53
00:01:59,521 --> 00:02:01,590
day when it came to movies.
Uh,

54
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:03,960
I went to see the Martian.
It was pretty good.

55
00:02:04,890 --> 00:02:06,960
Interesting.
But the problem is,

56
00:02:07,530 --> 00:02:09,810
the problem with that movie is,
you know,

57
00:02:09,811 --> 00:02:11,160
he's gonna live,
you know,

58
00:02:11,161 --> 00:02:14,550
he's gonna make it so it's like someone
gave you a spoiler alert before you even

59
00:02:14,551 --> 00:02:16,080
got to the movie.
It's like,

60
00:02:16,140 --> 00:02:17,730
oh,
is he going to die on Mars?

61
00:02:17,820 --> 00:02:21,420
Am I paying money to watch two hours of
him and he's going to die on Mars.

62
00:02:21,421 --> 00:02:23,760
Get the fuck Outta here.
Everybody knows he's not going to die on

63
00:02:23,761 --> 00:02:28,110
Mars.
But the revelation was there's,

64
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:32,580
there's too many movies.
And like even really awesome movies like

65
00:02:32,581 --> 00:02:37,440
Sicario is supposed to be pretty bad ass
because that's the new Benicio Del Toro

66
00:02:37,770 --> 00:02:38,180
movie.

67
00:02:38,180 --> 00:02:40,290
It's supposed to be pretty bad ass,
but we couldn't get a ticket to that

68
00:02:40,291 --> 00:02:42,150
one.
I'm in time.

69
00:02:42,510 --> 00:02:43,600
Uh,
we,

70
00:02:43,601 --> 00:02:45,510
we were sold out so we went with the
Martian.

71
00:02:45,830 --> 00:02:49,410
Um,
but the point is these movies never stop

72
00:02:49,590 --> 00:02:52,770
every week.
There's new ones and they don't go away.

73
00:02:53,130 --> 00:02:56,250
Like the old ones.
Don't stop being around like you can go

74
00:02:56,251 --> 00:02:58,230
watch them too.
It's like there's too many of them.

75
00:02:58,470 --> 00:03:02,350
Like I was thinking about all the
different movies just on itunes and

76
00:03:02,351 --> 00:03:05,140
Netflix and I was scrolling through them
and I started thinking like,

77
00:03:05,141 --> 00:03:08,110
this is a,
this is a never ending equation.

78
00:03:08,410 --> 00:03:10,330
Like it just keeps getting tacked onto
it.

79
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:13,510
We live in the epicenter of where it's
created.

80
00:03:13,810 --> 00:03:18,100
It's all around here and it's,
it's very strange because the body of

81
00:03:18,101 --> 00:03:21,760
work just never stops.
Like he used to be when I was a kid.

82
00:03:22,210 --> 00:03:25,600
When a good movie came out,
you would go to see that fucking movie,

83
00:03:25,630 --> 00:03:26,650
like Star Wars.

84
00:03:26,860 --> 00:03:31,860
I saw star wars 13 times and I was
nothing compared to the real geeks.

85
00:03:33,490 --> 00:03:34,540
Like there's,
there was like,

86
00:03:34,870 --> 00:03:38,800
it was a big deal back then to see how
many times you could see a movie,

87
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:42,940
like you couldn't run a movie long
enough to see for someone to see it 13

88
00:03:42,941 --> 00:03:47,290
times now because there's new ones,
there's new ones come in,

89
00:03:47,291 --> 00:03:49,570
we've got to get this fucking piece of
shit out of the theater.

90
00:03:49,690 --> 00:03:51,310
You would never have a movie like star
wars.

91
00:03:51,311 --> 00:03:53,860
It played over and over and over and
over and over and over again.

92
00:03:54,130 --> 00:03:59,080
And if star wars came out today,
people would shit right in it's mouth.

93
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:01,990
It's,
it's weird.

94
00:04:02,140 --> 00:04:05,950
That is to me in my childhood,
one of the greatest movies of all time

95
00:04:06,130 --> 00:04:08,170
when I was a kid and that movie came
out.

96
00:04:08,380 --> 00:04:12,800
I remember when Obi wan Kenobi was
talking to Luke Skywalker and uh,

97
00:04:12,820 --> 00:04:14,020
they were in the sand.

98
00:04:14,020 --> 00:04:16,390
I was like,
this is the greatest thing I've ever

99
00:04:16,391 --> 00:04:19,060
seen in my life.
This is amazing.

100
00:04:19,270 --> 00:04:23,230
This guy's in space and he's gonna Obi
wan Kenobi is going to teach them how to

101
00:04:23,231 --> 00:04:24,220
be a jet.
I,

102
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:26,590
oh,
this is the greatest movie ever.

103
00:04:26,830 --> 00:04:28,540
I remember.
It couldn't have been more perfect.

104
00:04:28,750 --> 00:04:30,190
I remember seeing that movie and
thinking,

105
00:04:30,191 --> 00:04:33,850
this movie is fucking perfect.
Now you go watch and you're like,

106
00:04:33,851 --> 00:04:36,070
oh my God,
it's such a clunky Turd.

107
00:04:36,550 --> 00:04:39,610
It's clunky.
The special effects look like shit.

108
00:04:39,730 --> 00:04:41,240
Why has darth vader evil?
Does he,

109
00:04:41,241 --> 00:04:43,030
does he just not even a reason why he's
evil?

110
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:45,610
He's just evil.
What does he get when he takes over the

111
00:04:45,611 --> 00:04:48,700
world is even get pussy is even going to
get any pussy in space.

112
00:04:48,940 --> 00:04:52,750
He know he's just building some giant
star that can blow up planets.

113
00:04:52,930 --> 00:04:54,970
Really?
This is so dumb.

114
00:04:55,140 --> 00:04:56,450
Like it's so dumb.
Oh,

115
00:04:56,510 --> 00:04:58,580
uses the dark side.
Oh No.

116
00:04:58,581 --> 00:05:01,210
If the dog.
So it's so fucking dumb.

117
00:05:01,210 --> 00:05:01,350
Um,

118
00:05:01,350 --> 00:05:04,430
and it's puppets.
It's like kermit the frog and Skywalker.

119
00:05:04,460 --> 00:05:07,680
But in its day,
like if you judge it in the context of

120
00:05:07,681 --> 00:05:10,260
its day,
it's one of the all time classic films.

121
00:05:11,130 --> 00:05:13,590
It's just,
there's so many more now and they're

122
00:05:13,591 --> 00:05:16,020
better.
Let's say you are a fighter,

123
00:05:16,170 --> 00:05:17,970
for example,
you got to have opponent,

124
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:23,090
but this time the opponent is yourself
and uh,

125
00:05:23,700 --> 00:05:28,700
and you know it from the inside and you
feel it from the inside and it makes you

126
00:05:28,711 --> 00:05:30,330
happy,
it makes you strong and makes you

127
00:05:30,331 --> 00:05:33,750
healthy.
And this is what we have lost from the

128
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:37,980
nature and now it's back.
So,

129
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:41,610
so in a sense,
what you've done is you tapped into

130
00:05:41,611 --> 00:05:45,150
something extremely primal by dealing
with one of the most primal elements at

131
00:05:45,151 --> 00:05:46,680
all of all,
which is cold.

132
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:50,370
Yes.
So the cold in the vice documentary,

133
00:05:50,371 --> 00:05:53,880
I thought that was really fascinating.
You said cold is your God.

134
00:05:54,630 --> 00:05:56,960
Yes it is.
Yeah.

135
00:05:57,590 --> 00:06:00,310
If I had a teacher,
I've never had a teacher that's,

136
00:06:00,620 --> 00:06:05,620
that's amazing.
I Know Guru or mentor or Sifu or

137
00:06:05,991 --> 00:06:06,824
anything like that.

138
00:06:07,780 --> 00:06:09,500
The cold.
That's my teacher.

139
00:06:09,670 --> 00:06:12,260
That's my God.
I've been dodging the colts and tells a

140
00:06:12,261 --> 00:06:14,350
little kid.
It's amazing.

141
00:06:15,110 --> 00:06:18,530
You just felt compelled to jump into
that.

142
00:06:18,620 --> 00:06:19,780
Yes,
absolutely.

143
00:06:19,850 --> 00:06:22,760
And what was,
when you're saying this to people when

144
00:06:22,761 --> 00:06:26,210
you're 31 years old and you're telling
people I can control my immune system,

145
00:06:26,211 --> 00:06:28,070
that they must have been like,
you're out of your fucking mind.

146
00:06:28,370 --> 00:06:30,950
Look at this guy's jumping into the
freezing water and he says he can

147
00:06:30,951 --> 00:06:34,940
control his immune system.
How did you convince people to the point

148
00:06:35,330 --> 00:06:39,650
that you got actual scientist to measure
your blood?

149
00:06:39,950 --> 00:06:44,950
Do legitimate scientific studies on you?
Like what was it your accomplishments

150
00:06:45,501 --> 00:06:49,090
like you went for people that don't know
you,

151
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:51,710
you did a bunch of really unbelievable
tasks.

152
00:06:51,740 --> 00:06:54,860
You climbed everest in your shorts.
Um,

153
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:56,840
did you have shoes on when you climbed
everest?

154
00:06:56,990 --> 00:06:58,640
Yes,
I had to with spikes.

155
00:06:58,730 --> 00:07:00,640
Spikes climbing,
right?

156
00:07:02,370 --> 00:07:04,560
No,
no.

157
00:07:04,561 --> 00:07:09,561
Showed on.
I think I go and buy clothes.

158
00:07:10,690 --> 00:07:14,940
It's insane because it's like you are
not challenging nature.

159
00:07:15,810 --> 00:07:18,480
You can go up with with their car as
well.

160
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:24,080
And then you'll go up everest.
Anything artificial you use in nature

161
00:07:24,930 --> 00:07:28,560
doesn't make you having the right
connection with nature.

162
00:07:29,190 --> 00:07:33,000
And what I wanted to challenge in all
the challenges I did,

163
00:07:33,030 --> 00:07:36,690
like marathons beyond the polar circle
in midwinter short,

164
00:07:36,930 --> 00:07:41,550
but also in the heat of the desert
without drinking or hanging by one

165
00:07:41,551 --> 00:07:44,230
finger,
one slash Columbia,

166
00:07:44,250 --> 00:07:48,390
or like a mile up in the air in winter
time.

167
00:07:48,570 --> 00:07:51,180
You hung up by one finger a mile up in
the air.

168
00:07:51,210 --> 00:07:52,043
Yes.
Yes.

169
00:07:52,050 --> 00:07:56,820
Where was this alternate holidays
between two hot air balloons and then

170
00:07:56,821 --> 00:07:59,580
climbing between them.
And then there was a,

171
00:07:59,581 --> 00:08:00,900
you know,
a thing,

172
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:03,960
a device I could looked it on with one
finger.

173
00:08:03,961 --> 00:08:05,550
Yes.
How long did you hang there for?

174
00:08:05,740 --> 00:08:08,640
A 25 seconds.
Five seconds.

175
00:08:08,670 --> 00:08:11,990
And with one finger.
And in wintertime,

176
00:08:12,850 --> 00:08:14,130
winter time,
you know,

177
00:08:14,131 --> 00:08:18,210
you lose control when the blood becomes
colder into hands,

178
00:08:18,690 --> 00:08:20,820
you lose control.
So that was the challenge.

179
00:08:21,090 --> 00:08:25,680
It's mind over matter.
And I wanted to show that in all the

180
00:08:25,710 --> 00:08:30,540
challenges,
the adaptive power of ours is enormous,

181
00:08:30,930 --> 00:08:35,100
but as we are not stimulating or using
that anymore,

182
00:08:36,090 --> 00:08:41,090
you get a neglected body and become sick
or half in its potency.

183
00:08:42,230 --> 00:08:43,410
And so very logic.

184
00:08:43,780 --> 00:08:48,780
So the powers that our body has,
the untapped power that we probably had

185
00:08:49,631 --> 00:08:51,760
for millennia,
dealing with the cold,

186
00:08:51,761 --> 00:08:53,500
dealing with the heat,
dealing with adversity,

187
00:08:53,501 --> 00:08:56,700
dealing with struggle,
all those powers are not being tapped

188
00:08:56,701 --> 00:08:57,840
into.
So because of that,

189
00:08:57,841 --> 00:09:01,020
the body just atrophies and we don't.
It doesn't know what to do with

190
00:09:01,021 --> 00:09:02,040
yourself.
Exactly.
