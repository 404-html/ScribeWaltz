1
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,070
Maybe chimpanzee.

2
00:00:05,071 --> 00:00:05,161
Yeah.

3
00:00:05,161 --> 00:00:06,240
That was gonna be like some Disney thing.

4
00:00:06,241 --> 00:00:06,451
I'm like,

5
00:00:06,451 --> 00:00:07,440
holy cow.

6
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:08,333
What movie was that?

7
00:00:08,730 --> 00:00:09,720
Literally called chimpanzee.

8
00:00:09,780 --> 00:00:10,050
Who?

9
00:00:10,050 --> 00:00:10,321
Is it?

10
00:00:10,321 --> 00:00:11,154
A documentary?

11
00:00:11,340 --> 00:00:11,940
Yeah.

12
00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:14,160
Like I didn't realize
chimps did calculator.

13
00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:15,083
Cruelty.

14
00:00:15,560 --> 00:00:16,393
Yeah,

15
00:00:16,510 --> 00:00:16,830
right.

16
00:00:16,830 --> 00:00:16,951
Well,

17
00:00:16,951 --> 00:00:18,690
we know better because we've advanced,

18
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:20,610
but if we hadn't,

19
00:00:21,030 --> 00:00:21,511
we'd be like,

20
00:00:21,511 --> 00:00:21,781
man,

21
00:00:21,781 --> 00:00:23,310
I don't want to fucking live in a house.

22
00:00:23,370 --> 00:00:23,970
I like the champ.

23
00:00:23,970 --> 00:00:26,190
Why his brow chimp ways to go?

24
00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:26,911
This is it,

25
00:00:26,911 --> 00:00:27,420
man.

26
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:28,253
Chimp life.

27
00:00:28,930 --> 00:00:30,480
I'm now,

28
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:35,160
but we in a way to the AI
might be like those chimps.

29
00:00:36,290 --> 00:00:38,190
I don't know how much do
we think about chimps?

30
00:00:38,610 --> 00:00:39,091
Not much.

31
00:00:39,091 --> 00:00:39,924
Very little.

32
00:00:40,380 --> 00:00:41,520
These chimps are at war.

33
00:00:41,850 --> 00:00:44,700
I saw that David Attenborough documentary
on Champs when they were eating those

34
00:00:44,701 --> 00:00:46,350
call bus monkeys and ripping them apart.

35
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:47,400
I go,

36
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:48,233
Oh,

37
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:49,770
this is why people were so crazy.

38
00:00:49,771 --> 00:00:50,880
We came from that thing.

39
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:51,600
Yeah,

40
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:52,190
exactly.

41
00:00:52,190 --> 00:00:53,023
Yeah.

42
00:00:53,900 --> 00:00:54,330
Yeah.

43
00:00:54,330 --> 00:00:55,860
But I got a better philosophy.

44
00:00:55,940 --> 00:00:56,250
Yeah.

45
00:00:56,250 --> 00:00:57,083
They like swingers.

46
00:00:57,270 --> 00:00:57,990
Yeah.

47
00:00:57,990 --> 00:00:58,823
They really are.

48
00:01:00,150 --> 00:01:01,530
They just seem to resolve.

49
00:01:01,531 --> 00:01:02,364
Everything was sex.

50
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:05,190
The only rules they have is
the mom won't bang the Sun.

51
00:01:05,250 --> 00:01:05,880
That's it.

52
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:06,713
Okay.

53
00:01:07,050 --> 00:01:07,883
They're good women,

54
00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:10,050
good women in the community.

55
00:01:10,051 --> 00:01:10,471
Everybody else.

56
00:01:10,471 --> 00:01:11,340
Just banging it out.

57
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:12,353
Yeah.

58
00:01:13,290 --> 00:01:14,430
I haven't seen the winova movie.

59
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:16,621
Well,

60
00:01:16,621 --> 00:01:18,300
they're disturbing just at a zoo,

61
00:01:18,990 --> 00:01:19,790
at the zoo.

62
00:01:19,790 --> 00:01:20,611
Just constantly going.

63
00:01:20,611 --> 00:01:21,444
Constantly fucking,

64
00:01:23,950 --> 00:01:24,230
yeah,

65
00:01:24,230 --> 00:01:25,021
and they don't care.

66
00:01:25,021 --> 00:01:25,351
Gay,

67
00:01:25,351 --> 00:01:25,861
straight,

68
00:01:25,861 --> 00:01:26,190
whatever.

69
00:01:26,190 --> 00:01:27,160
Let's just fuck it.

70
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:28,673
These labels

71
00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:31,830
I haven't seen when I was at a zero.

72
00:01:31,831 --> 00:01:34,470
That's probably not on the PGA section.

73
00:01:34,750 --> 00:01:36,270
I don't think they have them at many zoos.

74
00:01:36,271 --> 00:01:38,010
We've looked at that before too.

75
00:01:39,300 --> 00:01:42,000
I think that's a thing that they'd be
like to keep regular chimps at zoos.

76
00:01:42,001 --> 00:01:43,740
Cause Bonilla was just always jacking off.

77
00:01:44,850 --> 00:01:46,050
What's that they have in San Diego?

78
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:48,030
Really interesting.

79
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:49,253
Probably separate them.

80
00:01:50,710 --> 00:01:50,970
I mean,

81
00:01:50,970 --> 00:01:52,020
how many other in a cage,

82
00:01:52,710 --> 00:01:54,030
it's going to be pretty intense.
