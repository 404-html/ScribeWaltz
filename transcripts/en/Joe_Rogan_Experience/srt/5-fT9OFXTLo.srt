1
00:00:04,570 --> 00:00:06,070
The Joe Rogan experience.

2
00:00:18,470 --> 00:00:21,360
Oh,

3
00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:38,780
kicking it down.
These mice or hottest fuck chicken and 

4
00:00:39,561 --> 00:00:41,190
live from the Rogan compound with my man
already.

5
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:43,080
Shaffir already motherfucking spheres in
the house.

6
00:00:43,081 --> 00:00:46,760
Ladies and gentlemen.
A R s h a f F I r,

7
00:00:46,820 --> 00:00:49,500
follow him on twitter.
Joe Is Mad Flavor,

8
00:00:50,170 --> 00:00:52,860
Aka Planet Rock,
Aka Joey Karate.

9
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:55,050
He's here as well.
Brian,

10
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:56,490
right?
Brian Redman,

11
00:00:56,520 --> 00:00:57,180
red,
b,

12
00:00:57,181 --> 00:01:01,020
a n.
As long as that was going on.

13
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,500
When it's background music.
Did you make that Song Brian?

14
00:01:04,590 --> 00:01:05,520
No,
it's my laptop.

15
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:07,230
Oh yeah,
we did.

16
00:01:08,370 --> 00:01:11,010
We used to put between garageband and 
guitars.

17
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:12,450
Yeah.
We haven't been playing music.

18
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:14,520
I'm trying to clean it up for satellite 
radio,

19
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,670
which may or may not ever happen.
Hopefully.

20
00:01:17,671 --> 00:01:18,780
Well,
it looks like it's happening.

21
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:23,700
Whatever bitches.
I'm much respect to the fleshlight.

22
00:01:23,970 --> 00:01:25,740
Our sponsor,
before we even get started,

23
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:30,800
before we get groovy,
which you bitches if you go to Joe 

24
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:30,800
Rogan.net.

25
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:31,290
What's that?
Buddy was in the corner.

26
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:32,580
Just.
That's one of them yesterday.

27
00:01:32,670 --> 00:01:34,350
They're all over the place.
There's one over here too,

28
00:01:34,690 --> 00:01:37,470
so house is littered with Mrs.
Rogan comes in there the other day.

29
00:01:37,490 --> 00:01:38,430
It looks at all of them.
She goes,

30
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:41,220
is there enough of these?
Is what she looks at him.

31
00:01:41,221 --> 00:01:46,221
She goes to these,
so she looks at them like this is like 

32
00:01:46,221 --> 00:01:50,270
her competition that she has to accept 
like little things that live in her 

33
00:01:50,270 --> 00:01:53,270
house that I fuck houses full of baby 
dolls and male Gobos.

34
00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:54,060
Yeah.
What's up?

35
00:01:55,650 --> 00:01:59,890
Filled with child's toys and Dick Toys.
Big Fat box addicted.

36
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:03,360
If you go to Joe Rogan.net,
click the link for the flashlight.

37
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:05,610
You go to the website,
type in the word Rogan.

38
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:08,370
Get 15 percent off.
Some looking out for your bitches.

39
00:02:08,371 --> 00:02:13,371
You know what I'm seeing?
I'm trying to get you some discounts on 

40
00:02:13,371 --> 00:02:15,381
your masturbation at me.
God is calling you to do what you gotta 

41
00:02:15,381 --> 00:02:20,300
do.
If you could save 10 points and whack 

42
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:20,300
off at the same time,
it was better than you.

43
00:02:22,370 --> 00:02:25,020
We had a good goddamn time last weekend 
in Vegas.

44
00:02:25,021 --> 00:02:26,340
Holy Shit.
Was that fun?

45
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,480
That that was a good fucking time.
These guys dropped acid.

46
00:02:30,481 --> 00:02:35,481
They were up in the the stairs watching 
with big smiles on the faces.

47
00:02:35,701 --> 00:02:38,160
I don't know.
When I found out that they dropped acid,

48
00:02:38,190 --> 00:02:41,190
did I find out a dinner I tweeted you at
during the UFC?

49
00:02:41,550 --> 00:02:42,790
Yeah,
but I don't get tweets.

50
00:02:42,820 --> 00:02:43,540
Yeah,
I mean,

51
00:02:43,630 --> 00:02:45,360
I mean tax texted him.
He texted me.

52
00:02:45,380 --> 00:02:46,410
Yeah.
So that's how I found out.

53
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:48,830
No,
it was like the last half hour.

54
00:02:48,831 --> 00:02:49,390
Right.
You look,

55
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:52,550
you look it up.
I thought waved at us.

56
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:53,340
Oh,
okay.

57
00:02:53,460 --> 00:02:55,700
Then I must have known it was sitting in
the drawer,

58
00:02:56,050 --> 00:03:01,050
red cable.
One day we're talking about something 

59
00:03:01,050 --> 00:03:03,440
else and I go,
it's to be great this weekend that as 

60
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:05,671
I'm talking to them,
I open up a lot higher in low and there 

61
00:03:05,671 --> 00:03:05,671
were seven hits.
Acid.

62
00:03:05,671 --> 00:03:07,330
If we dropped the s and he's like,
oh,

63
00:03:07,331 --> 00:03:08,080
I don't know.
And I go,

64
00:03:08,081 --> 00:03:13,081
every time somebody gets hit will feel.
It was the original plan.

65
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:17,270
At first we were like,
well what do you think about red band?

66
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:22,680
We don't know when we're saying that we 
should fucking dose I'm ever going to 

67
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:25,791
put out some for the said Nah,
because I know it's hard to have nine 

68
00:03:25,791 --> 00:03:26,520
slash 11 fucking.

69
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:29,200
That's my little brother acids.
A little different.

70
00:03:29,201 --> 00:03:34,201
You don't want to dose somebody with 
acid made a decision not to do it 

71
00:03:34,201 --> 00:03:35,740
anymore in my life because I've gotten 
to a point where my brain,

72
00:03:35,741 --> 00:03:39,010
I just want to keep my brain a little 
bit together and it was together.

73
00:03:39,050 --> 00:03:42,960
Station stuff.
This stuff is very mild.

74
00:03:43,950 --> 00:03:46,220
Sure.
If that was kid stuff that was good.

75
00:03:46,221 --> 00:03:46,560
He said,
yeah,

76
00:03:46,570 --> 00:03:50,200
well if you took a two hits and you were
still being able to sit there,

77
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:51,360
then it had to be shaved.

78
00:03:51,450 --> 00:03:52,890
Very Mild,
very mild.

79
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:55,390
It came in spurts and burst.
It was very nice.

80
00:03:55,830 --> 00:03:57,650
The lights fucked with you.
Uh,

81
00:03:57,690 --> 00:04:00,000
what did they voice fuck with you from 
time to time?

82
00:04:00,020 --> 00:04:00,960
Have Buffer,
buffer,

83
00:04:01,420 --> 00:04:06,420
be a really great.
Is his vibrated you and that video 

84
00:04:06,420 --> 00:04:07,380
before the UFC he starts.
Oh,

85
00:04:07,381 --> 00:04:08,190
that was powerful

86
00:04:08,450 --> 00:04:13,450
throughout.
There was a part where already looked 

87
00:04:13,450 --> 00:04:15,221
over and goes,
this is the most beautiful thing I've 

88
00:04:15,221 --> 00:04:16,820
ever seen.
The best job on that thing.

89
00:04:17,180 --> 00:04:20,150
It was the bathroom that you have to see
video when it first starts,

90
00:04:20,151 --> 00:04:20,440
where it's like

91
00:04:22,350 --> 00:04:23,570
they said it to the,
uh,

92
00:04:23,740 --> 00:04:28,740
American.
That teenage or teenage Riley's and uh,

93
00:04:29,660 --> 00:04:30,530
yeah,
they set all the beats,

94
00:04:30,710 --> 00:04:32,080
all the punches to the,
you know,

95
00:04:32,210 --> 00:04:37,210
junk hits.
He realized how brilliant something is 

96
00:04:37,210 --> 00:04:37,370
sometimes when you're high.
What is it about that?

97
00:04:37,371 --> 00:04:39,140
Why do you,
why do you have to get high to,

98
00:04:39,170 --> 00:04:40,530
to realize that?
I don't know.

99
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:42,140
It seems silly when you're sitting 
there,

100
00:04:42,590 --> 00:04:45,290
you're straight out of the UFC and it 
starts.

101
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:49,070
We don't say all that shit.
You feel it.

102
00:04:49,750 --> 00:04:51,470
When we,
when we did ds,

103
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:53,840
it was a different fucking level.
We felt everything.

104
00:04:54,020 --> 00:04:59,020
It's funny how like you go to the movies
and if you go to the movies you're on 

105
00:04:59,020 --> 00:05:02,921
acid or on pot or anything.
You could see bad acting domino that 

106
00:05:04,221 --> 00:05:04,830
night.
Huh?

107
00:05:04,910 --> 00:05:09,910
That's why we sat down,
watched domino with fucking Mickey 

108
00:05:09,910 --> 00:05:10,100
Rourke and carrot dangling.
It was interesting.

109
00:05:10,550 --> 00:05:12,560
It was interesting.
It was from a different angle.

110
00:05:12,561 --> 00:05:13,730
You're watching acting.
So.

111
00:05:13,731 --> 00:05:15,650
I'm sorry I interrupted you.
So what were you saying?

112
00:05:15,651 --> 00:05:17,180
You were saying that you're,
you guys are there,

113
00:05:17,181 --> 00:05:20,010
you're on acid,
and the Babo Riley's starts playing in,

114
00:05:20,011 --> 00:05:21,230
which is,
if you've never seen it,

115
00:05:21,470 --> 00:05:23,960
never been to a lot of UFC.
It's really brilliant.

116
00:05:23,961 --> 00:05:26,720
Whoever edited it,
it's like some of the highlights of some

117
00:05:26,721 --> 00:05:29,540
of the greatest fights ever and it's all
put together to the WHO.

118
00:05:29,590 --> 00:05:34,590
It's fucking.
It's one of the greatest videos humans 

119
00:05:34,590 --> 00:05:37,481
have ever,
so it's a perfect volume to rip you 

120
00:05:37,481 --> 00:05:37,790
apart.
You could hear it,

121
00:05:37,791 --> 00:05:42,791
but it doesn't really bother you.
Dana and Dana and I were watching that 

122
00:05:42,791 --> 00:05:43,580
the other day and I go,
dude,

123
00:05:43,581 --> 00:05:47,650
I think I've seen this a thousand times 
and I still like watching it.

124
00:05:47,651 --> 00:05:52,651
I love it.
It's a good thing if you're there live 

125
00:05:52,651 --> 00:05:52,651
10 minutes before the UFC actually 
starts,

126
00:05:52,651 --> 00:05:52,820
you have to be in your seat.

127
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:55,220
You have to be so good to like whoever 
did it.

128
00:05:55,221 --> 00:05:57,590
You can tell that guy loves fights like 
he just.

129
00:05:57,591 --> 00:06:02,591
He nailed it to perfect beats to the 
perfect fucking punches and kicks and 

130
00:06:02,591 --> 00:06:04,670
gets you pumped up.
Definitely do.

131
00:06:04,850 --> 00:06:05,600
Today.
I'm telling you,

132
00:06:05,601 --> 00:06:06,660
it never wears out.
I've,

133
00:06:06,690 --> 00:06:11,690
I've seen it hundreds of times.
I don't know how many times I've seen 

134
00:06:11,690 --> 00:06:11,690
it,
I've seen it.

135
00:06:11,690 --> 00:06:14,460
I mean every UFC star have done at least
100 us' and you're there.

136
00:06:14,470 --> 00:06:16,680
You're not getting food when that's 
happening.

137
00:06:16,681 --> 00:06:19,420
Yeah,
because between spikes between spike and

138
00:06:19,460 --> 00:06:21,410
regular UFC is.
I think I've done over 100,

139
00:06:21,411 --> 00:06:23,060
so been over a thousand fights.
Well,

140
00:06:23,061 --> 00:06:25,910
here's the best one.
It and we need it.

141
00:06:26,230 --> 00:06:29,610
Like I said,
when you're there as a civilian and on,

142
00:06:29,620 --> 00:06:33,990
it just goes from Babo rally and it 
locks down here.

143
00:06:35,330 --> 00:06:37,270
You just see a picture and this is 
silver saying,

144
00:06:37,750 --> 00:06:42,750
when I go back tonight,
I'm going to knock his fucking mouth 

145
00:06:42,750 --> 00:06:42,750
block right now.

146
00:06:42,750 --> 00:06:47,220
Think about it on the acid.
Now his head just came out and I think 

147
00:06:47,220 --> 00:06:48,880
it was vetoed and it was just a fucking 
head.

148
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:53,200
I thought it was fucking Marlon Brando 
is superman.

149
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:58,720
The fucking heads around them.
It was like you're going down in New 

150
00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:01,900
York City,
got water.

151
00:07:02,550 --> 00:07:04,510
They were judging them and it was just 
heads will.

152
00:07:04,511 --> 00:07:09,511
That's the brilliance about it.
That at one point in the UFC as a 

153
00:07:09,511 --> 00:07:12,871
civilian,
it just gets very dark and it's just a 

154
00:07:12,871 --> 00:07:12,871
perfect timing.
Austin,

155
00:07:12,871 --> 00:07:17,840
you see a head pop back tonight.
I'm going to take them pound them 

156
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:17,840
submission.
You're like,

157
00:07:18,810 --> 00:07:23,810
yeah,
you just gotTa keep showing little 

158
00:07:23,810 --> 00:07:23,810
tidbits,
you know,

159
00:07:23,810 --> 00:07:25,060
and they showed a veto.
Then they went to John Jones,

160
00:07:25,061 --> 00:07:29,140
then they went to Jake Ellensburg.
It was just so well done.

161
00:07:29,230 --> 00:07:34,230
Every time that show a new allied or 
ducks crowd explodes and it's when you 

162
00:07:34,230 --> 00:07:34,630
watch another sporting event.

163
00:07:34,630 --> 00:07:36,520
Now it's so below that.
Paul,

164
00:07:36,550 --> 00:07:39,100
I went to a Laker game last year 
against,

165
00:07:39,370 --> 00:07:44,370
uh,
against Wade waves team though he might 

166
00:07:44,370 --> 00:07:44,560
Miami here.
There was a fucking great game,

167
00:07:44,980 --> 00:07:49,160
but there was a lot of lols in it.
There's a lot of lows in it at the UFC.

168
00:07:49,161 --> 00:07:52,360
When Bruce Buffer says,
do what you gotTa do,

169
00:07:52,570 --> 00:07:55,600
Go for 22 fucking minutes.
I like glass.

170
00:07:55,690 --> 00:07:56,850
I like,
go get a hot dog,

171
00:07:56,860 --> 00:07:58,630
right?
We argue that fucking thing.

172
00:07:58,770 --> 00:08:03,770
We now want a fucking game stuff that's 
huge that they tell you that courtesy 

173
00:08:05,530 --> 00:08:07,470
and what that is Fox had done.
No.

174
00:08:07,471 --> 00:08:09,600
Sometimes we have a certain amount of 
prelim cards,

175
00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:12,150
but then the main card started saying 
like,

176
00:08:12,340 --> 00:08:13,440
you know,
7:00

177
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:15,330
PM and if the main card starts at 7:00
PM,

178
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:17,550
we have to have,
if the prelims are all done,

179
00:08:18,090 --> 00:08:20,370
sometimes you get 20 minutes for the 
fights are supposed to start.

180
00:08:20,460 --> 00:08:22,890
So we don't start fights early.
We have to wait until paperview starts.

181
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:25,950
Sometimes you get like five first round 
knockouts in the early fights.

182
00:08:25,951 --> 00:08:26,580
Yeah.
And they're just like,

183
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:31,880
yeah.
And then we run out quick and it was 

184
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:32,370
weird because this particular UFC 
started off.

185
00:08:32,371 --> 00:08:37,371
I think we gave Ruediger as wherever he 
for Paul Taylor and beat up fast and 

186
00:08:38,820 --> 00:08:43,820
then Kingsley came out against Romero 
and hit him with violent gladiator fuck 

187
00:08:44,421 --> 00:08:48,590
it up.
And these to the body and like fuck man,

188
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:53,600
you can feel bad motherfucker.
You could feel the fucking chimney 

189
00:08:54,391 --> 00:08:56,500
strikes.
I kinda have the asset.

190
00:08:56,501 --> 00:09:00,780
I was finding myself like this and also 
I looked around and adjust myself.

191
00:09:00,990 --> 00:09:05,990
What's going on?
Check yourself before you wreck 

192
00:09:05,990 --> 00:09:05,990
yourself.

193
00:09:05,990 --> 00:09:10,050
Even when you're not high.
That dude's a specimen or specimen it.

194
00:09:10,190 --> 00:09:12,530
He's kind of like a fucking solid 12 
pack.

195
00:09:12,650 --> 00:09:15,350
He's got a 12 pack on his back.
He's one of those dudes.

196
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:20,520
You look at his back,
there's all these crazy striations in 

197
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:20,520
their super athlete.
Yeah.

198
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:24,831
It was fun shit with those football 
players on another level to another 

199
00:09:26,061 --> 00:09:29,450
level of athleticism and Kingsbury 
smashed that dude.

200
00:09:29,451 --> 00:09:34,451
He just,
he's one of those guys every time you 

201
00:09:34,451 --> 00:09:36,131
see him,
it's like he's been training for three 

202
00:09:36,131 --> 00:09:36,131
years,
you know,

203
00:09:36,131 --> 00:09:36,131
he makes these leaps and a couple of 
months.

204
00:09:36,131 --> 00:09:36,190
And I was like,
yeah,

205
00:09:36,430 --> 00:09:37,790
all those super athletes,
man,

206
00:09:37,810 --> 00:09:39,920
that Jon Jones dudes,
those guys,

207
00:09:39,921 --> 00:09:41,780
they make these giant leaps.
You know,

208
00:09:41,781 --> 00:09:44,300
there's some dudes to just get so good 
so quick.

209
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:45,830
You know,
when you watch like John Jones,

210
00:09:45,831 --> 00:09:47,900
the first fight that he had a um,
you know,

211
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,400
or even the fight with Stephan Bonner.

212
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:54,400
Yeah.
He looked promising but bought or made 

213
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:54,400
it to the distance,
you know,

214
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:59,200
I mean he beat bond are up and 
everything like that and did some wild 

215
00:09:59,200 --> 00:09:59,200
stuff.
People are like,

216
00:09:59,200 --> 00:09:59,200
wow,
this kid is wild.

217
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:01,460
He's unorthodox.
But then you see them now and you go,

218
00:10:01,461 --> 00:10:05,990
fuck man,
this kid is on another level to another.

219
00:10:06,030 --> 00:10:08,360
The way he handled Brandon Vera and you 
know,

220
00:10:08,361 --> 00:10:10,790
I mean his last fight was just,
just proved it.

221
00:10:10,791 --> 00:10:13,910
Brian painters a fucking stud.
He just manhandled that kid.

222
00:10:14,210 --> 00:10:16,550
He was on top of him.
Every time there was an exchange,

223
00:10:16,551 --> 00:10:21,551
he was on top controlling the position.
He was never remotely threatened and 

224
00:10:21,551 --> 00:10:21,551
squeezing.
Yeah.

225
00:10:21,551 --> 00:10:22,580
The kids a beast,
man.

226
00:10:22,700 --> 00:10:27,700
Ryan Bader is a fucking gorilla.
Do would you just stand next to that 

227
00:10:27,700 --> 00:10:31,451
guy?
He's one of the biggest tool fibers out 

228
00:10:31,451 --> 00:10:33,311
there.
And the fact that Jon Jones is able to 

229
00:10:33,311 --> 00:10:33,311
handle him like that.

230
00:10:33,311 --> 00:10:33,500
It was like a half second where there 
was like a scrum,

231
00:10:33,501 --> 00:10:36,390
like he tried to flip it and get them 
all the way over and then John's got out

232
00:10:36,391 --> 00:10:41,391
of that and it was done in.
Jon Jones has two brothers and both of 

233
00:10:41,391 --> 00:10:42,200
them are fucking football player.
Bad motherfuckers.

234
00:10:42,230 --> 00:10:47,230
Yeah.
It's like his whole family's got like 

235
00:10:47,230 --> 00:10:47,230
super genes that was standing there that
night.

236
00:10:47,230 --> 00:10:47,890
He had two brothers that were bigger 
than.

237
00:10:47,930 --> 00:10:50,600
I guess he's the.
He has a baby brother or whatever in the

238
00:10:50,601 --> 00:10:55,230
1975 nba playoffs on those years.
Daryl Dawkins member,

239
00:10:55,231 --> 00:10:57,020
Daryl Dawkins,
he was six foot two,

240
00:10:57,090 --> 00:11:00,640
smashed it backboards six slash 11 to 
90.

241
00:11:01,010 --> 00:11:06,010
I remember that into a brawl with 
Maurice Lucas and all of a sudden they 

242
00:11:06,010 --> 00:11:08,300
showed his family coming down from the 
stands and they had two brothers and his

243
00:11:08,310 --> 00:11:11,460
sister bigger than him from fucking 
Florida.

244
00:11:11,461 --> 00:11:15,490
You know what those mother online 
trolling security important.

245
00:11:15,900 --> 00:11:18,010
They're all nice white people up there 
in Portland.

246
00:11:18,170 --> 00:11:23,170
These four fucking fucking people were 
just throwing them out of that six foot 

247
00:11:23,511 --> 00:11:27,530
11.
Jarrod was smashing fiberglass.

248
00:11:28,420 --> 00:11:29,440
Unheard of.
I remember.

249
00:11:29,780 --> 00:11:32,520
You know what I'm saying?
I'm just crushed up glass.

250
00:11:32,530 --> 00:11:35,300
Why aren't they with their fucking 
reinforced.

251
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:38,690
That guy who was fresh out of the 
jungles of fuck.

252
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:43,700
What?
What did they do back then when the 

253
00:11:43,700 --> 00:11:46,360
glass breaks?
Did they just roll it out and they roll 

254
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:49,901
another again?
Another one that the fuck you got to 

255
00:11:49,901 --> 00:11:49,901
find.
How much did he get fined?

256
00:11:49,901 --> 00:11:50,870
I don't know.
Maybe 10 grand.

257
00:11:50,871 --> 00:11:52,970
This is so worth it.
That's.

258
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:55,190
We know about your highlights.
What Glen?

259
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:58,810
Luckily they don't all do that.
That would be so douchey if they all did

260
00:11:58,811 --> 00:12:00,150
it.
It's like a douchey way.

261
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:02,020
You can do it by accident game.
We'd go back.

262
00:12:02,021 --> 00:12:04,300
We just come up like Shaq would just 
smash through it and he wouldn't be able

263
00:12:04,301 --> 00:12:04,440
to.

264
00:12:04,490 --> 00:12:09,490
The Sun.
You can really try to break it to Shaq 

265
00:12:09,490 --> 00:12:09,490
smack him occasionally.
Yeah,

266
00:12:09,490 --> 00:12:12,250
but not on purpose.
He just fucking what's so hard down.

267
00:12:12,910 --> 00:12:14,260
I'm looking into it.
Okay.

268
00:12:14,470 --> 00:12:19,470
He hasn't done in a while,
but when he was the first couple of 

269
00:12:19,470 --> 00:12:19,470
years ago,
dude,

270
00:12:19,470 --> 00:12:19,470
I met him a couple of times on the first
amendment,

271
00:12:19,470 --> 00:12:21,880
the UFC and I met him.
He did an episode of fear factor with me

272
00:12:22,060 --> 00:12:23,620
and he,
he did the countdown,

273
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:24,340
you know,
like three,

274
00:12:24,820 --> 00:12:26,650
two,
one go,

275
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:27,940
you know,
standing next to me.

276
00:12:27,970 --> 00:12:30,760
Dude.
It looked like it didn't even look like.

277
00:12:30,830 --> 00:12:33,130
I mean it looked like we were two 
totally different things.

278
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:34,930
You met him in Boston?
We ran into him at the hotel.

279
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:35,590
Oh yeah,
that's true.

280
00:12:35,770 --> 00:12:37,660
He's giant.
He's so big.

281
00:12:37,990 --> 00:12:39,190
He's so big.
It's ridiculous.

282
00:12:39,191 --> 00:12:41,620
I feel like I like a little child.
You know what?

283
00:12:41,620 --> 00:12:46,620
This dude,
Daryl Dawkins played for the sixers and 

284
00:12:46,620 --> 00:12:47,920
he got traded to the New Jersey.
I hope that I'm fucking powder,

285
00:12:48,490 --> 00:12:53,490
that he really,
really good that would sell him the 

286
00:12:53,490 --> 00:12:53,920
powder was the sneaker kid.
He was the book hit on the net.

287
00:12:53,921 --> 00:12:58,921
At that time.
This kid ran a tremendous scan because 

288
00:12:58,921 --> 00:13:00,640
the players on contract,
they take after every game,

289
00:13:00,641 --> 00:13:02,530
they put on new speakers and they drove 
away.

290
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:05,960
Real kit would take every sneaker and 
take it into the city itself.

291
00:13:06,580 --> 00:13:09,610
One of his jobs is a ballboy was to get 
the Balkans powder.

292
00:13:09,820 --> 00:13:10,450
That was it,
Brian.

293
00:13:10,451 --> 00:13:15,451
Whatever he did and we all met and I 
remember one day he took us down or 

294
00:13:15,451 --> 00:13:18,930
House Darryl Dawkins showed me a fucking
Rolls Royce with a 14 motherfucking 

295
00:13:19,210 --> 00:13:22,890
carried dashboard dashboard.

296
00:13:25,330 --> 00:13:29,760
Financially irresponsible while his wife
died.

297
00:13:29,770 --> 00:13:34,770
Later on,
he came back before a couple of years 

298
00:13:34,770 --> 00:13:36,901
there.
I went over to his house like three 

299
00:13:36,901 --> 00:13:39,060
times lived.
See quote because New Jersey Big Pimpin 

300
00:13:39,060 --> 00:13:42,640
with the motherfucking 14 karat 
dashboard shit.

301
00:13:42,910 --> 00:13:44,920
Wow.
That's ridiculous.

302
00:13:45,190 --> 00:13:46,620
That is ridiculous.
Doug,

303
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:51,720
you gotTa love it though.
What is it about black people and shiny 

304
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:55,000
things?
Don't live in a tent to have a fuck 

305
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:59,471
Rolls Royce to the 14th is my kids will 
start it as much as rock stars like to 

306
00:13:59,471 --> 00:14:02,200
rock it and like to look bad ass.
They don't go that deep.

307
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:04,540
They don't go diamonds.
I heard a theory on that.

308
00:14:04,750 --> 00:14:06,640
Is it black people are rappers and 
stuff.

309
00:14:06,700 --> 00:14:10,150
They're just doing what they thought 
about was rich when they were little,

310
00:14:10,420 --> 00:14:12,910
so it's always them holding a bowl of 
sugar.

311
00:14:12,911 --> 00:14:15,580
Cereal and cars and put women.
Yeah,

312
00:14:15,581 --> 00:14:16,270
but it's like,
oh,

313
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:18,120
this looks like rich stuff for while.

314
00:14:18,210 --> 00:14:21,190
Got a urinal installed in his house.
Nothing wrong with that.

315
00:14:21,191 --> 00:14:26,191
That's probably a good move.
Especially one of those flashlights 

316
00:14:26,191 --> 00:14:26,191
splashes here and I'll say the cake in 
there.

317
00:14:26,191 --> 00:14:27,490
Save water.
They have like a little disk,

318
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:30,310
little Ufo you piss on somehow or 
another.

319
00:14:30,340 --> 00:14:35,340
Go somewhere.
You don't have to just rent the word 

320
00:14:35,340 --> 00:14:35,340
water.
Yeah,

321
00:14:35,340 --> 00:14:37,480
that's like the latest eco thing,
but it's been rejected by plumbers.

322
00:14:37,481 --> 00:14:39,910
Plumbers don't like it because it cuts 
back on the maintenance,

323
00:14:39,911 --> 00:14:44,080
so they try to say unsanitary,
but in actuality the other ones are more

324
00:14:44,170 --> 00:14:45,880
unsanitary.
How weird is that?

325
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:48,480
Know there's been studies,
Joe Diaz,

326
00:14:48,490 --> 00:14:51,770
studies on pis that's talk about urine.
Tell you something.

327
00:14:51,771 --> 00:14:54,160
When I was a kid in the first house,
I moved into block burger,

328
00:14:54,190 --> 00:14:57,520
but nice big one.
We had a fucking the day religion.

329
00:14:57,530 --> 00:14:58,240
Really?
Yeah.

330
00:14:58,241 --> 00:15:01,130
That shit.
When I was about eight or nine or 10,

331
00:15:01,540 --> 00:15:02,850
I used to go over there and take a shit.

332
00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:05,570
My mother's bathroom turned down and hit
me in the fucking face.

333
00:15:05,571 --> 00:15:06,820
You know what I'm saying?
But then you,

334
00:15:07,070 --> 00:15:12,070
you put your little muffled on that,
but day you get that little hot water 

335
00:15:12,070 --> 00:15:12,070
going.
That was the first time I have that.

336
00:15:12,070 --> 00:15:14,000
That little cranky.
You're a little muffled,

337
00:15:14,001 --> 00:15:17,480
but then he blasted hard.
Your asshole spotless.

338
00:15:17,481 --> 00:15:19,790
You could feel it shiny.
I was about 10.

339
00:15:19,791 --> 00:15:22,190
I mean that's what my son used to shine.
You know what I'm saying?

340
00:15:22,250 --> 00:15:25,880
I use my for carrying magazines.
You don't use it.

341
00:15:26,280 --> 00:15:29,350
Never him have one.
Use that shit every day.

342
00:15:29,380 --> 00:15:33,320
So much better than wedding.
Toilet paper seemed so bizarre.

343
00:15:33,321 --> 00:15:36,740
I am so.
Seems UNAMERICAN given into the French.

344
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:39,650
What am I doing here?
Supporting my own.

345
00:15:40,130 --> 00:15:43,750
What am I doing here?
What a role a God damn toilet paper's on

346
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:44,720
enough for you.
Rogan.

347
00:15:45,270 --> 00:15:48,700
I feel like I'm not supporting my own.
You some French bullshit,

348
00:15:48,750 --> 00:15:51,210
but day is nice.
Hands.

349
00:15:52,340 --> 00:15:54,260
A lot of commitment when you wipe your 
butt.

350
00:15:54,261 --> 00:15:55,220
It's like slow.
Yeah,

351
00:15:55,221 --> 00:16:00,221
I know it's still stinky and gross,
but wiping my button a that had some 

352
00:16:00,221 --> 00:16:02,120
fucking soap in that mother fucker use 
baby wipes.

353
00:16:02,121 --> 00:16:04,220
Have you ever been a white flight,
but what?

354
00:16:04,250 --> 00:16:05,870
Have you ever been about the fucking 
realize my app.
