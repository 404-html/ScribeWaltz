1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,350
The joe rogan experience character cause
cause I've done that where I've gone

2
00:00:04,351 --> 00:00:07,380
over to the line and I've said
things that I don't believe in.

3
00:00:07,381 --> 00:00:08,910
It made me feel bad later.

4
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:09,690
Yeah.

5
00:00:09,690 --> 00:00:11,980
I opened for Nirvana and uh,

6
00:00:12,570 --> 00:00:14,490
and know comics are always like,

7
00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:15,271
oh you know,

8
00:00:15,271 --> 00:00:16,650
getting heckled and stuff,

9
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:17,221
you know.

10
00:00:17,221 --> 00:00:19,380
I mean I got hit with teenagers,

11
00:00:19,410 --> 00:00:24,410
they would successfully throw people
from the pit and hit me and I had an

12
00:00:24,620 --> 00:00:29,040
[inaudible] going off around me and
I get hit with bibles a lot too,

13
00:00:29,041 --> 00:00:29,874
which was weird.

14
00:00:30,210 --> 00:00:30,570
Whoa.

15
00:00:30,570 --> 00:00:31,170
Wow.

16
00:00:31,170 --> 00:00:31,501
Yeah.

17
00:00:31,501 --> 00:00:32,910
And so boots and stuff.

18
00:00:32,911 --> 00:00:35,940
So I learned like I learned
like the Serpentine,

19
00:00:35,941 --> 00:00:36,451
you know what I mean?

20
00:00:36,451 --> 00:00:37,231
I would just go back.

21
00:00:37,231 --> 00:00:39,130
And how have the times
did you open for that?

22
00:00:39,131 --> 00:00:39,331
I did,

23
00:00:39,331 --> 00:00:40,200
I think like 16,

24
00:00:40,201 --> 00:00:41,190
17 shows.

25
00:00:41,850 --> 00:00:43,560
Then every once in a
while we would go okay.

26
00:00:43,561 --> 00:00:44,460
Which was weird,

27
00:00:44,461 --> 00:00:45,270
you know,

28
00:00:45,270 --> 00:00:49,080
but I was more comfortable
when it was horrible.

29
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:50,310
I know that sounds weird,

30
00:00:50,311 --> 00:00:51,810
but that was my,

31
00:00:52,050 --> 00:00:54,750
that felt right to do.

32
00:00:54,751 --> 00:00:55,460
You know what I mean?

33
00:00:55,460 --> 00:00:56,580
That's he deserved.

34
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:57,151
No,

35
00:00:57,151 --> 00:00:58,890
I just thought it was kind of funny.

36
00:00:58,891 --> 00:00:59,221
You know,

37
00:00:59,221 --> 00:01:00,870
like when you get laughs,

38
00:01:00,900 --> 00:01:02,970
that means the crowd likes you.

39
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,920
When you get like rage,

40
00:01:04,950 --> 00:01:07,500
that means you have
all of their attention.

41
00:01:07,710 --> 00:01:08,543
Do you know what I mean?

42
00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:10,080
Like Robin Williams is my good friend,

43
00:01:10,081 --> 00:01:10,291
right.

44
00:01:10,291 --> 00:01:11,124
And Robin,

45
00:01:11,490 --> 00:01:11,731
you know,

46
00:01:11,731 --> 00:01:15,930
he goes on stage and people love them
and then I would go on after him when we

47
00:01:15,931 --> 00:01:16,741
do sets and,

48
00:01:16,741 --> 00:01:17,280
and,

49
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:17,821
and,

50
00:01:17,821 --> 00:01:19,050
and in a weird way,

51
00:01:19,051 --> 00:01:21,300
it meant more for me for people to go,

52
00:01:21,330 --> 00:01:21,661
oh,

53
00:01:21,661 --> 00:01:23,220
Robin Williams showed up last night.

54
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:24,241
Yeah.

55
00:01:24,241 --> 00:01:25,680
And then Bobcat Goldthwait was dead.

56
00:01:25,681 --> 00:01:27,130
You know what that fucking asshole said?

57
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:28,233
You know,

58
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:30,930
in a weird way that meant more to me,

59
00:01:30,931 --> 00:01:31,710
you know,

60
00:01:31,710 --> 00:01:34,620
his form of neuroses
is way more lucrative.

61
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:35,500
You know,

62
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:38,250
I'm telling people to fuck
off isn't as lucrative.

63
00:01:38,251 --> 00:01:38,550
But,

64
00:01:38,550 --> 00:01:39,210
uh,

65
00:01:39,210 --> 00:01:39,571
but yeah,

66
00:01:39,571 --> 00:01:43,320
so it was opening for Nirvana and Chicago
and Michael Jordan and retired from

67
00:01:43,321 --> 00:01:44,154
basketball.

68
00:01:44,180 --> 00:01:45,013
And I went,

69
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:45,811
hey,

70
00:01:45,811 --> 00:01:46,770
Chicago,

71
00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:47,281
by the way,

72
00:01:47,281 --> 00:01:48,450
they hated me to begin with,

73
00:01:48,451 --> 00:01:48,751
but I go,

74
00:01:48,751 --> 00:01:48,991
hey,

75
00:01:48,991 --> 00:01:49,531
Chicago,

76
00:01:49,531 --> 00:01:50,221
I feel bad,

77
00:01:50,221 --> 00:01:50,911
but you know,

78
00:01:50,911 --> 00:01:52,530
for $40 million a year,

79
00:01:52,531 --> 00:01:54,420
I'd shoot my own dad in the fucking head,

80
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:55,100
you know?

81
00:01:55,100 --> 00:01:55,933
Oh.

82
00:01:58,530 --> 00:02:01,110
And there was a noise that
wasn't even like a Bu.

83
00:02:01,111 --> 00:02:01,944
It was just

84
00:02:03,330 --> 00:02:03,900
like,

85
00:02:03,900 --> 00:02:04,860
fuck you.

86
00:02:06,630 --> 00:02:07,920
I wish I had that sample.

87
00:02:08,390 --> 00:02:09,550
It was the best known

88
00:02:12,170 --> 00:02:13,003
and knew.

89
00:02:13,010 --> 00:02:14,970
What did you think at that
moment when you heard that?

90
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:16,290
It was funny,

91
00:02:16,291 --> 00:02:16,681
you know,

92
00:02:16,681 --> 00:02:17,370
but,

93
00:02:17,370 --> 00:02:18,180
but I did,

94
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:18,391
you know,

95
00:02:18,391 --> 00:02:19,800
I don't have a beef with Michael Jordan.

96
00:02:19,801 --> 00:02:20,341
I felt bad.

97
00:02:20,341 --> 00:02:20,611
I mean,

98
00:02:20,611 --> 00:02:21,150
even though,

99
00:02:21,150 --> 00:02:24,000
cause people just because they're super
famous doesn't mean they're still not

100
00:02:24,001 --> 00:02:24,391
human.

101
00:02:24,391 --> 00:02:24,900
So I did,

102
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:25,171
I go,

103
00:02:25,171 --> 00:02:25,981
why'd I do that?

104
00:02:25,981 --> 00:02:26,521
But you know,

105
00:02:26,521 --> 00:02:27,450
so he had to live in,

106
00:02:27,451 --> 00:02:28,740
you learn it's baby steps.

107
00:02:28,770 --> 00:02:32,340
But the only person laughing
that night really was,

108
00:02:32,341 --> 00:02:34,590
I remember walking by Kurt
on the amp and he goes,

109
00:02:34,591 --> 00:02:35,850
I can't believe you said that.

110
00:02:37,510 --> 00:02:38,101
But yeah,

111
00:02:38,101 --> 00:02:38,491
I had,

112
00:02:38,491 --> 00:02:39,190
uh,

113
00:02:39,190 --> 00:02:39,600
met,

114
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:40,111
uh,

115
00:02:40,111 --> 00:02:40,521
Nirvana.

116
00:02:40,521 --> 00:02:42,540
I met Kurt before they broke.

117
00:02:42,570 --> 00:02:45,510
He was a fan of mine and
wanted to interview me.

118
00:02:45,510 --> 00:02:48,390
So he interviewed me at a
college radio station in Anarbor.

119
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:50,540
I know that blows people's minds.

120
00:02:50,550 --> 00:02:54,660
It's like finding out that like a Jimmy
Hendrix really loved Buddy Hackett or

121
00:02:54,661 --> 00:02:55,494
something.

122
00:02:55,950 --> 00:02:56,250
But,

123
00:02:56,250 --> 00:02:56,880
uh,

124
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:57,713
but he did,

125
00:02:58,290 --> 00:02:58,580
I,

126
00:02:58,580 --> 00:02:59,030
he did.

127
00:02:59,030 --> 00:02:59,290
He,

128
00:02:59,290 --> 00:03:00,123
dude,

129
00:03:00,790 --> 00:03:01,301
I love that.

130
00:03:01,301 --> 00:03:02,210
Talking Duck Moose

131
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:06,270
blew my mind.

132
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:07,313
Wow.

133
00:03:08,250 --> 00:03:09,180
That's pretty fucking cool.

134
00:03:09,580 --> 00:03:11,100
I toured in the open form.

135
00:03:11,190 --> 00:03:15,420
I repelled in nude from the roof of the
Oakland Coliseum on new years when the

136
00:03:15,450 --> 00:03:17,670
with them cause they were playing there.

137
00:03:17,671 --> 00:03:18,504
And uh,

138
00:03:18,660 --> 00:03:19,493
and uh,

139
00:03:19,740 --> 00:03:20,573
yeah.

140
00:03:21,590 --> 00:03:22,470
Did you meet Courtney?

141
00:03:22,471 --> 00:03:24,100
Where you around court a little bit?

142
00:03:24,210 --> 00:03:25,620
Did you see their relationship?

143
00:03:25,790 --> 00:03:26,280
I mean,

144
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:26,461
the,

145
00:03:26,461 --> 00:03:28,590
what I saw actually I don't have many,

146
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:29,040
uh,

147
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:30,390
any good dirt for people.

148
00:03:30,391 --> 00:03:31,830
They seem to like each other.

149
00:03:31,831 --> 00:03:32,220
I'm not,

150
00:03:32,220 --> 00:03:32,641
you know,

151
00:03:32,641 --> 00:03:32,841
I,

152
00:03:32,841 --> 00:03:33,150
I,

153
00:03:33,150 --> 00:03:33,960
uh,

154
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:34,410
I,

155
00:03:34,410 --> 00:03:34,801
you know,

156
00:03:34,801 --> 00:03:36,000
I think people,

157
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:36,870
you know,

158
00:03:36,870 --> 00:03:37,440
I,

159
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:37,831
you know,

160
00:03:37,831 --> 00:03:39,020
people get it well done,

161
00:03:39,021 --> 00:03:41,360
all this crazy conspiracy
stuff and all that stuff.

162
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:43,160
I think what happens with some things,

163
00:03:43,161 --> 00:03:45,770
and I know where I am when I'm
talking about crazy conspiracy,

164
00:03:45,980 --> 00:03:50,980
but sometimes I think like huge tragedies
happen and people can't justify them,

165
00:03:51,410 --> 00:03:54,110
so they have to make up some other thing.

166
00:03:54,111 --> 00:03:55,010
You know what I'm saying?

167
00:03:55,011 --> 00:03:56,440
I think sometimes it's,

168
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:56,910
it's,

169
00:03:56,910 --> 00:03:57,711
it's just,

170
00:03:57,711 --> 00:03:58,544
um,

171
00:03:59,120 --> 00:03:59,650
you know,

172
00:03:59,650 --> 00:04:00,420
I,

173
00:04:00,420 --> 00:04:00,981
I,

174
00:04:00,981 --> 00:04:01,371
you know,

175
00:04:01,371 --> 00:04:02,840
Kurt was a really sweet guy,

176
00:04:02,841 --> 00:04:04,280
but he certainly was a,

177
00:04:04,281 --> 00:04:05,540
a manic depressive.

178
00:04:05,550 --> 00:04:06,890
And I almost think like,

179
00:04:06,891 --> 00:04:07,251
again,

180
00:04:07,251 --> 00:04:08,630
when we're talking about drugs earlier,

181
00:04:08,631 --> 00:04:09,710
people are talking about drugs.

182
00:04:09,711 --> 00:04:10,544
It's like,

183
00:04:10,670 --> 00:04:11,600
like that killed them.

184
00:04:11,601 --> 00:04:11,931
It's like,

185
00:04:11,931 --> 00:04:13,130
well that didn't really kill him.

186
00:04:13,131 --> 00:04:13,551
You know,

187
00:04:13,551 --> 00:04:13,791
he,

188
00:04:13,791 --> 00:04:13,941
he,

189
00:04:13,941 --> 00:04:15,830
he had some in his system when he died,

190
00:04:15,831 --> 00:04:15,981
but he,

191
00:04:15,981 --> 00:04:16,221
he,

192
00:04:16,221 --> 00:04:16,360
he,

193
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:16,631
he,

194
00:04:16,631 --> 00:04:19,280
he cleaned up enough to commit suicide.

195
00:04:19,281 --> 00:04:19,431
You know,

196
00:04:19,431 --> 00:04:21,600
there's some people that
are chemical imbalances.

197
00:04:21,610 --> 00:04:23,390
There's some people that
are prone to suicide.

198
00:04:23,391 --> 00:04:25,580
And I think blaming drugs is really lazy,

199
00:04:25,581 --> 00:04:26,414
you know?

200
00:04:26,750 --> 00:04:28,490
Well certainly upsets the balance though,

201
00:04:28,491 --> 00:04:28,731
right?

202
00:04:28,731 --> 00:04:29,000
I mean,

203
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:29,870
I have weird,

204
00:04:30,290 --> 00:04:32,090
I'm 30 years sober and I'm saying this,

205
00:04:32,091 --> 00:04:32,420
but,

206
00:04:32,420 --> 00:04:33,051
but you know,

207
00:04:33,051 --> 00:04:35,000
I think it's just easy to blame drugs.

208
00:04:35,330 --> 00:04:36,141
Do you have any,

209
00:04:36,141 --> 00:04:39,860
did you document your time with a nirvana
at all or with curt or anything like

210
00:04:39,861 --> 00:04:40,820
that at that time too?

211
00:04:40,821 --> 00:04:43,520
Did you have like video cam
quarters and you kept around?

212
00:04:43,910 --> 00:04:44,870
I have a,

213
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:45,470
I have,

214
00:04:45,470 --> 00:04:50,470
I have seen a photo of me
nude behind him on stage with,

215
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:56,120
I have the Nutro wings on and then I'm
naked with a repelling little thing.

216
00:04:56,991 --> 00:04:57,441
And then,

217
00:04:57,441 --> 00:04:57,620
uh,

218
00:04:57,620 --> 00:04:58,310
I love him back.

219
00:04:58,310 --> 00:04:59,510
And I also have a hat on.

220
00:04:59,540 --> 00:05:00,021
I like the,

221
00:05:00,021 --> 00:05:03,320
I don't mind people seeing
my dick when my love handles,

222
00:05:03,321 --> 00:05:04,700
but not my balding pate.

223
00:05:05,210 --> 00:05:06,290
So I've got a hat.

224
00:05:06,620 --> 00:05:07,453
Uh,

225
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:08,571
I will say this,

226
00:05:08,571 --> 00:05:11,750
if you're a comedian and performer
and you're going to be nude publicly,

227
00:05:11,751 --> 00:05:12,590
give it a tug.

228
00:05:12,860 --> 00:05:13,161
You'll,

229
00:05:13,161 --> 00:05:14,880
you'll thank me later cause uh,

230
00:05:14,910 --> 00:05:15,410
uh,

231
00:05:15,410 --> 00:05:15,711
yeah,

232
00:05:15,711 --> 00:05:16,544
it was cold.

233
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:19,550
I really wish I did pull my Dick.

234
00:05:19,670 --> 00:05:22,010
How many photos are
there of that out there?

235
00:05:22,380 --> 00:05:23,070
Surprising.

236
00:05:23,070 --> 00:05:23,800
Not a ton.

237
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:24,633
You know,

238
00:05:24,980 --> 00:05:25,550
this was,

239
00:05:25,550 --> 00:05:26,240
uh,

240
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:27,440
was in the mid nineties,

241
00:05:27,441 --> 00:05:27,951
I guessing,

242
00:05:27,951 --> 00:05:28,784
right.

243
00:05:28,940 --> 00:05:30,410
Even have digital cameras.

244
00:05:30,411 --> 00:05:32,540
So now it would have
been everybody's phone,

245
00:05:32,990 --> 00:05:33,471
but still,

246
00:05:33,471 --> 00:05:33,711
I mean,

247
00:05:33,711 --> 00:05:34,610
it wasn't hot.

248
00:05:34,611 --> 00:05:35,391
It was just weird,

249
00:05:35,391 --> 00:05:35,900
you know,

250
00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:36,561
there was so much,

251
00:05:36,561 --> 00:05:36,941
man,

252
00:05:36,941 --> 00:05:38,150
I'm going on stage too,

253
00:05:38,151 --> 00:05:38,571
by the way,

254
00:05:38,571 --> 00:05:39,500
cause it was midnight,

255
00:05:39,501 --> 00:05:39,921
you know,

256
00:05:39,921 --> 00:05:41,270
fireworks were going off.

257
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:41,990
It was just like,

258
00:05:41,990 --> 00:05:42,381
oh yeah.

259
00:05:42,381 --> 00:05:43,340
And there's Bob Scratch,

260
00:05:43,341 --> 00:05:45,830
Goldfarb nude walking around like a chair.

261
00:05:47,030 --> 00:05:47,863
I was,

262
00:05:48,110 --> 00:05:48,943
we were going to,

263
00:05:48,980 --> 00:05:50,120
the way that it was set up,

264
00:05:50,121 --> 00:05:50,391
the,

265
00:05:50,391 --> 00:05:50,840
uh,

266
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:51,270
uh,

267
00:05:51,270 --> 00:05:52,103
it was men,

268
00:05:52,110 --> 00:05:52,381
you know,

269
00:05:52,381 --> 00:05:52,951
New Year's.

270
00:05:52,951 --> 00:05:55,680
So they wanted to do an extra
thing where there's explosions.

271
00:05:55,681 --> 00:05:55,861
And I,

272
00:05:55,861 --> 00:05:56,850
and I remember saying the,

273
00:05:57,260 --> 00:05:57,591
uh,

274
00:05:57,591 --> 00:05:58,101
I said,

275
00:05:58,101 --> 00:05:58,580
you know,

276
00:05:58,580 --> 00:05:59,150
you know,

277
00:05:59,150 --> 00:05:59,511
I go,

278
00:05:59,511 --> 00:06:00,320
fuck you man.

279
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:02,210
I'm tired of being your scatter.

280
00:06:02,211 --> 00:06:03,380
That was Elvis's chimp,

281
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:04,250
you know,

282
00:06:04,250 --> 00:06:04,881
fuck you man.

283
00:06:04,881 --> 00:06:06,020
I don't want to cheer you up,

284
00:06:06,050 --> 00:06:06,321
you know,

285
00:06:06,321 --> 00:06:07,910
go called Pauly shore's something,

286
00:06:07,911 --> 00:06:08,630
you know.

287
00:06:08,630 --> 00:06:09,463
So,

288
00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:10,700
uh,

289
00:06:10,700 --> 00:06:11,260
when we,

290
00:06:11,260 --> 00:06:13,610
we set up the thing about me rip peddling,

291
00:06:13,970 --> 00:06:15,140
the guy took a cold,

292
00:06:15,170 --> 00:06:18,230
the stage manager took cold cuts
and he built the stage out of the,

293
00:06:18,231 --> 00:06:19,760
out of the food tray in the back.

294
00:06:19,761 --> 00:06:20,181
And he's like,

295
00:06:20,181 --> 00:06:20,421
okay,

296
00:06:20,421 --> 00:06:21,410
here's what Chris's,

297
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:22,310
here's Dave years,

298
00:06:22,311 --> 00:06:24,860
Kurt and Bob's going to repel in noon.

299
00:06:24,950 --> 00:06:27,350
And these m and m's are
where the explosives are.

300
00:06:28,010 --> 00:06:28,843
And so,

301
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:29,833
and so,

302
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:30,410
um,

303
00:06:30,410 --> 00:06:30,830
I,

304
00:06:30,830 --> 00:06:31,341
it's still,

305
00:06:31,341 --> 00:06:31,671
they go,

306
00:06:31,671 --> 00:06:32,930
Kurt will count,

307
00:06:32,990 --> 00:06:34,310
we'll tell you when it's midnight,

308
00:06:34,311 --> 00:06:36,680
you count back from 10 or whatever,

309
00:06:36,681 --> 00:06:37,131
you know,

310
00:06:37,131 --> 00:06:37,491
and uh,

311
00:06:37,491 --> 00:06:38,180
and the,

312
00:06:38,180 --> 00:06:38,601
okay,

313
00:06:38,601 --> 00:06:39,020
so,

314
00:06:39,020 --> 00:06:39,471
so,

315
00:06:39,471 --> 00:06:39,710
uh,

316
00:06:39,710 --> 00:06:41,250
it's midnight and they
give him the sing though,

317
00:06:41,251 --> 00:06:44,450
and he looks up and I'm
holding my own weight,

318
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:45,620
like rappelling down,

319
00:06:45,621 --> 00:06:46,370
but I stopped,

320
00:06:46,370 --> 00:06:46,611
you know,

321
00:06:46,611 --> 00:06:47,570
so he can count.

322
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:48,740
And so I'm giving them the Brown.

323
00:06:48,741 --> 00:06:49,401
I basically,

324
00:06:49,401 --> 00:06:50,600
from 150 feet up,

325
00:06:51,020 --> 00:06:51,650
he goes,

326
00:06:51,650 --> 00:06:52,760
he looks up and he goes,

327
00:06:53,450 --> 00:06:54,610
Hey Oakland,

328
00:06:54,620 --> 00:06:56,210
you wanna hear a drum solo.

329
00:06:57,350 --> 00:07:01,160
And so I'm barely coming
out of my own way.

330
00:07:01,161 --> 00:07:03,680
And then finally he just goes one.

331
00:07:04,340 --> 00:07:04,701
And I,

332
00:07:04,701 --> 00:07:06,470
and I shot down really fast.

333
00:07:06,471 --> 00:07:08,210
I had rope burns on my ass and sound like,

334
00:07:08,750 --> 00:07:10,160
and I landed right behind him,

335
00:07:10,161 --> 00:07:10,994
Bam.

336
00:07:11,090 --> 00:07:11,571
And then,

337
00:07:11,571 --> 00:07:11,990
uh,

338
00:07:11,990 --> 00:07:12,810
I came down so fast,

339
00:07:12,810 --> 00:07:13,700
he actually didn't see it.

340
00:07:13,701 --> 00:07:14,270
And then he like,

341
00:07:14,270 --> 00:07:15,410
he looks up and he's like,

342
00:07:15,411 --> 00:07:16,244
Paulie,

343
00:07:16,580 --> 00:07:17,413
Paulie.

344
00:07:17,810 --> 00:07:18,450
So,

345
00:07:18,450 --> 00:07:23,450
and so then I ducked behind this amp
looking for a cover because they're

346
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:25,130
supposed to be when my clothes
are supposed to be there,

347
00:07:25,131 --> 00:07:26,690
but someone had taken him as a joke,

348
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:27,530
you know?

349
00:07:27,530 --> 00:07:30,380
And so I just kinda had to stand in the
middle of the stage because everywhere

350
00:07:30,381 --> 00:07:31,880
there was bombs going off,

351
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:34,070
I learned this as if
you're nude at midnight,

352
00:07:34,100 --> 00:07:35,090
you don't get a kiss.

353
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:36,170
Like everywhere I went,

354
00:07:36,171 --> 00:07:37,004
people were like,

355
00:07:38,390 --> 00:07:38,721
Whoa,

356
00:07:38,721 --> 00:07:40,440
nude guy walking around.

357
00:07:40,470 --> 00:07:41,303
A little weird.

358
00:07:42,290 --> 00:07:43,160
So yeah,

359
00:07:43,161 --> 00:07:44,120
so again,

360
00:07:44,121 --> 00:07:45,650
all of this was in sobriety.

361
00:07:46,220 --> 00:07:46,900
Wow.

362
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:51,900
[inaudible].
