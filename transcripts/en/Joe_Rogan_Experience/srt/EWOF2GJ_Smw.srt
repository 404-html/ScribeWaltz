1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:01,590
The joe rogan experience.

2
00:00:02,070 --> 00:00:03,180
So I might not recognize it,

3
00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:03,960
but that's just,

4
00:00:03,960 --> 00:00:07,490
I don't even know why speculated
fucking wasted all your time.

5
00:00:10,280 --> 00:00:11,400
Joe Rogan says,

6
00:00:15,270 --> 00:00:16,530
keep on questioning everything.

7
00:00:16,531 --> 00:00:19,380
You can't stop on that show.

8
00:00:19,381 --> 00:00:20,214
The question

9
00:00:22,170 --> 00:00:22,771
with the one with,

10
00:00:22,771 --> 00:00:23,190
with the,

11
00:00:23,190 --> 00:00:24,023
with chem trails,

12
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:25,471
I don't know either way,

13
00:00:25,471 --> 00:00:26,310
I'm not fucking up there.

14
00:00:26,311 --> 00:00:29,250
But there is a difference between
the ones that that do dissipate.

15
00:00:29,251 --> 00:00:29,551
Correct.

16
00:00:29,551 --> 00:00:31,350
You know right away and
the ones that stick around.

17
00:00:31,970 --> 00:00:32,930
Well again,

18
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:38,040
I say absolutely not a scientist nor
in anything that I will say on any,

19
00:00:39,330 --> 00:00:44,070
whether it's about fucking air
travel or space exploration,

20
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:45,450
anything that I'll say on anything,

21
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:49,230
the caveat that it must be stated is
I don't know what the fuck I'm talking

22
00:00:49,231 --> 00:00:49,680
about.

23
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:50,660
I have no education,

24
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:54,030
these subjects and I'm merely reiterating
things that I've heard people say

25
00:00:54,031 --> 00:00:54,900
online that's like,

26
00:00:54,901 --> 00:00:56,850
if you were to say that
everyone would think so though.

27
00:00:56,850 --> 00:00:57,320
You know what I mean?

28
00:00:57,320 --> 00:00:58,620
You sound confident about the problem.

29
00:00:59,040 --> 00:00:59,550
Problem.

30
00:00:59,550 --> 00:01:00,383
It's awesome.

31
00:01:00,390 --> 00:01:01,223
I sound like an idiot.

32
00:01:01,940 --> 00:01:02,281
Well,

33
00:01:02,281 --> 00:01:02,510
it's just,

34
00:01:02,510 --> 00:01:05,370
especially if I'm wrong and I'm super
confident that that's how called get

35
00:01:05,371 --> 00:01:06,204
started again.

36
00:01:06,630 --> 00:01:06,941
The,

37
00:01:06,941 --> 00:01:07,250
um,

38
00:01:07,250 --> 00:01:07,411
yeah,

39
00:01:07,411 --> 00:01:09,210
people are confident people
want to listen to them,

40
00:01:09,270 --> 00:01:11,760
but I'm super honest about
what I know and I don't know.

41
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:14,220
I'm fucking as honest
as as humanly possible,

42
00:01:14,221 --> 00:01:15,570
even if it makes it look like an asshole.

43
00:01:15,990 --> 00:01:17,670
But in that situation,

44
00:01:17,970 --> 00:01:19,890
I do know for a fact that when,

45
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:24,360
when Khan trails or more likely
there's a map on a NASA website,

46
00:01:24,570 --> 00:01:28,530
you can go to the NASA website and they'll
show you where controls will linger

47
00:01:28,531 --> 00:01:29,910
in the sky and where they won't.

48
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:30,931
In fact,

49
00:01:30,931 --> 00:01:32,010
in 1942,

50
00:01:32,011 --> 00:01:36,150
the government was doing a research
project on what they called persistent

51
00:01:36,151 --> 00:01:37,380
condensation trails.

52
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:41,520
And what they discovered is during
various atmosphere conditions,

53
00:01:41,521 --> 00:01:44,970
whether there's a lot of moisture
in the atmosphere or less moisture,

54
00:01:45,210 --> 00:01:47,220
depending on what the conditions are,

55
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:50,280
it will change the length of the
contracts that appear behind jets.

56
00:01:50,580 --> 00:01:52,080
And when you burn jet fuel,

57
00:01:52,081 --> 00:01:53,250
it creates moisture.

58
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:56,400
And when you create moisture out of
that burning jet fuel and it changes the

59
00:01:56,401 --> 00:01:58,500
temperature of the air as
it passes through like that,

60
00:01:58,501 --> 00:01:59,790
you literally create a cloud.

61
00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:02,160
And so when people are looking
at that and they're thinking,

62
00:02:02,190 --> 00:02:02,341
oh,

63
00:02:02,341 --> 00:02:04,320
the government spraying
us with fake clouds,

64
00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:07,200
it's very easy to think
that it's very easy.

65
00:02:07,201 --> 00:02:12,201
And this does not mean that they haven't
done tests and really unethical things

66
00:02:13,531 --> 00:02:15,360
with spraying aerosols from planes.

67
00:02:15,660 --> 00:02:16,471
We know they have,

68
00:02:16,471 --> 00:02:18,330
we know that pesticides
are sprayed from planes.

69
00:02:18,331 --> 00:02:18,800
Okay,

70
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:19,290
so we've,

71
00:02:19,290 --> 00:02:19,531
we're,

72
00:02:19,531 --> 00:02:20,400
we're familiar.

73
00:02:20,401 --> 00:02:22,710
We have that archetype in
our head of spraying poison.

74
00:02:22,830 --> 00:02:26,880
We've seen the footage from Vietnam when
they sprayed agent orange to defoliate

75
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:28,650
vast parts in jungles.

76
00:02:28,651 --> 00:02:29,700
We've seen all that shit.

77
00:02:29,850 --> 00:02:33,810
So we're wary of things that are
sprayed from planes and you should be,

78
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:38,220
but you should also know that there is
a huge difference between that and what

79
00:02:38,221 --> 00:02:40,230
you're seeing in the
sky in a regular basis.

80
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:42,120
And when you start saying that,

81
00:02:42,121 --> 00:02:44,820
what you're seeing this guy on a regular
basis is the government's spraying

82
00:02:44,850 --> 00:02:45,683
chemicals.

83
00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:49,920
You really throw a monkey wrench into
the whole idea of them actually spraying

84
00:02:49,921 --> 00:02:50,700
chemicals.

85
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:51,720
Because first of all,

86
00:02:51,721 --> 00:02:51,971
if the,

87
00:02:51,971 --> 00:02:52,180
the,

88
00:02:52,180 --> 00:02:54,990
the argument is they're
spraying of aluminum and Barium.

89
00:02:54,991 --> 00:02:55,320
Again,

90
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:56,041
I'm not a scientist.

91
00:02:56,041 --> 00:02:56,874
I'm half retarded.

92
00:02:57,450 --> 00:02:58,283
Again,

93
00:02:58,340 --> 00:03:00,220
it took a lot shots to
the head as a youngster.

94
00:03:00,870 --> 00:03:05,200
But the reality is if they did spray
aluminum and Barium and the sky wouldn't

95
00:03:05,201 --> 00:03:06,520
linger like a cloud,

96
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:09,310
it's a lingering like a
cloud because it's a cloud.

97
00:03:09,670 --> 00:03:14,530
And I know a lot of people have invested
a long amount of their life wanting to

98
00:03:14,531 --> 00:03:16,510
think that what they're
seeing is chemicals.

99
00:03:16,660 --> 00:03:20,170
And so it fucks with you because
it's hard to admit you're wrong.

100
00:03:20,860 --> 00:03:22,000
It's hard to change gears.

101
00:03:22,001 --> 00:03:22,750
We all know that.

102
00:03:22,750 --> 00:03:23,140
Correct.

103
00:03:23,140 --> 00:03:24,640
But in this situation,

104
00:03:25,030 --> 00:03:26,890
we have to look at it.

105
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:30,070
There might be times when someone's
spraying something from the sky,

106
00:03:30,190 --> 00:03:34,900
but the majority of what you're seeing
is just a byproduct of a jet engine going

107
00:03:34,901 --> 00:03:35,770
through condensation.

108
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:37,270
And then there's the reality.

109
00:03:37,330 --> 00:03:37,751
People say,

110
00:03:37,751 --> 00:03:37,841
well,

111
00:03:37,841 --> 00:03:38,840
are they geoengineering?

112
00:03:39,010 --> 00:03:39,431
No,

113
00:03:39,431 --> 00:03:40,264
but yes.

114
00:03:40,270 --> 00:03:41,380
So here's the reality.

115
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:42,430
The reality is,

116
00:03:42,730 --> 00:03:46,990
even though it's just an
accidental byproduct of jet travel,

117
00:03:47,020 --> 00:03:50,630
it does change the environment
and it is geoengineering.

118
00:03:50,770 --> 00:03:52,010
But it's not on purpose,

119
00:03:52,011 --> 00:03:52,750
not on purpose.

120
00:03:52,750 --> 00:03:54,160
It's just a part of flying.

121
00:03:54,190 --> 00:03:55,023
If we're going to have,

122
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:59,170
there's 93,000 fucking
flights a day worldwide a day.

123
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:02,800
So they're burning jet fuel
in the sky above your head.

124
00:04:02,801 --> 00:04:07,801
They're taking toxic fuel in fucking
hundred gallon wings full of this shit.

125
00:04:08,021 --> 00:04:12,580
Your wings are filled up with fucking
fuel and they're burning that shit up in

126
00:04:12,581 --> 00:04:14,140
the sky and creating clouds.

127
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:15,011
Fuck yeah.

128
00:04:15,011 --> 00:04:16,210
It changes the environment,

129
00:04:16,300 --> 00:04:19,720
but it's just like pollution
changes the environment.

130
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:21,310
In La when you're driving on the highway,

131
00:04:21,311 --> 00:04:23,140
it's not the government's
spraying pollution.

132
00:04:23,141 --> 00:04:23,680
Okay?

133
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:24,820
It's fucking pollution.

134
00:04:24,821 --> 00:04:29,770
It's just a byproduct of
human civilization and a
byproduct of air travel is a,

135
00:04:29,830 --> 00:04:31,780
they're burning jet
fuel in the sky and be,

136
00:04:31,870 --> 00:04:36,370
it creates persistent condensation trails
under certain atmospheric conditions.

137
00:04:36,580 --> 00:04:40,870
This is the best that I could discern
after research and talking to real

138
00:04:40,871 --> 00:04:41,500
experts,

139
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:43,000
but this does it and
this is where he'll go.

140
00:04:43,001 --> 00:04:45,430
You're a fucking douche information
urgent Joe brokers working for the

141
00:04:45,431 --> 00:04:46,200
government.

142
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:50,800
You've got to stop and look at this shit
rationally if you're wrong about the

143
00:04:50,801 --> 00:04:52,780
majority of what you see in the sky,

144
00:04:52,870 --> 00:04:54,670
you discredit the possibility,

145
00:04:54,671 --> 00:04:57,760
the very real possibility
that things have been done.

146
00:04:57,880 --> 00:05:00,130
Like there's a study about Saint Louis,

147
00:05:00,370 --> 00:05:01,121
I think it was Saint Louis.

148
00:05:01,121 --> 00:05:01,361
Hold on.

149
00:05:01,361 --> 00:05:01,740
Let me,

150
00:05:01,740 --> 00:05:02,471
let me pull this up.

151
00:05:02,471 --> 00:05:03,304
St Louis,

152
00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:07,630
there was a something that was in the
news really recently that they discovered

153
00:05:07,631 --> 00:05:08,470
radiation.

154
00:05:08,470 --> 00:05:10,780
I think chem trails or
just an excuse for pansies.

155
00:05:10,781 --> 00:05:13,260
I'm just that like to look at
clouds and they went something like,

156
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:14,131
like a reason.

157
00:05:14,131 --> 00:05:14,964
It was a beautiful,

158
00:05:15,710 --> 00:05:16,491
I'm just curious how,

159
00:05:16,491 --> 00:05:16,691
what,

160
00:05:16,691 --> 00:05:16,991
why,

161
00:05:16,991 --> 00:05:19,150
why some stick around and why some don't.

162
00:05:19,300 --> 00:05:19,601
Okay,

163
00:05:19,601 --> 00:05:20,320
so they're here.

164
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:22,420
Well this is because of
atmospheric conditions.

165
00:05:22,550 --> 00:05:23,400
There's a difference between,

166
00:05:23,410 --> 00:05:24,910
sometimes it rains and
sometimes it doesn't.

167
00:05:25,030 --> 00:05:26,050
Sometimes there's clouds,

168
00:05:26,051 --> 00:05:26,810
sometimes there's nothing.

169
00:05:26,810 --> 00:05:27,410
This guy,

170
00:05:27,410 --> 00:05:30,520
the conditions apparently when
it's right before a crowd,

171
00:05:30,521 --> 00:05:31,840
like it's Kinda hazy.

172
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:35,080
Those are the conditions that are
best for creating these persistent

173
00:05:35,081 --> 00:05:38,260
condensation trails and people have to
understand these are fucking southwest

174
00:05:38,261 --> 00:05:39,760
airlines flights you're looking at.

175
00:05:39,870 --> 00:05:41,560
Sometimes we put these either these are,

176
00:05:41,561 --> 00:05:41,831
you know,

177
00:05:41,831 --> 00:05:42,970
unmarked government planes.

178
00:05:43,180 --> 00:05:43,481
Man.

179
00:05:43,481 --> 00:05:44,290
Do you really know that?

180
00:05:44,290 --> 00:05:44,951
What kind of fucking,

181
00:05:44,951 --> 00:05:45,190
Eric,

182
00:05:45,190 --> 00:05:46,480
what kind of telescoped you have?

183
00:05:46,481 --> 00:05:48,940
How much research have you
actually done or are you like me?

184
00:05:48,940 --> 00:05:53,170
Do you just reiterate you that you learn
online will doing this show and doing

185
00:05:53,171 --> 00:05:54,340
the show on chem trails?

186
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:57,440
More people got fucking mad at
me because of Cantrell's trails.

187
00:05:57,441 --> 00:05:58,274
Then anything,

188
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:00,290
and I take part of the blame for that.

189
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:03,530
One of the reasons why is because I
think they did a shitty job of editing it

190
00:06:03,531 --> 00:06:04,610
and this is no disrespect,

191
00:06:04,820 --> 00:06:06,530
but the way that people edit that show,

192
00:06:06,740 --> 00:06:08,270
they have eight hours of footage.

193
00:06:08,271 --> 00:06:10,040
They have to slam down to 44 minutes.

194
00:06:10,260 --> 00:06:14,990
To them it wasn't important to totally
completely explain what what causes the

195
00:06:14,991 --> 00:06:15,470
chem trail.

196
00:06:15,470 --> 00:06:18,440
I didn't have 100% say
or a contrail rather.

197
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:21,350
I didn't have 100% say as
to how the show got edited.

198
00:06:21,351 --> 00:06:24,020
I had say after the fact,

199
00:06:24,021 --> 00:06:25,070
I would voice my opinion.

200
00:06:25,071 --> 00:06:27,020
He would get overruled or
they would listen to me.

201
00:06:27,021 --> 00:06:27,231
It was,

202
00:06:27,231 --> 00:06:27,530
it would,

203
00:06:27,530 --> 00:06:32,060
it varied and in this I lost and in
this I think we created a bad product.

204
00:06:32,090 --> 00:06:36,440
I don't think it represented fully the
the correct full explanation of what

205
00:06:36,441 --> 00:06:37,070
contracts are.

206
00:06:37,070 --> 00:06:39,530
I think because it's such a complex issue,

207
00:06:39,710 --> 00:06:43,070
I think we owed a very complex
and scientific explanation.

208
00:06:43,071 --> 00:06:45,320
But the problem is people
think that Shit's boring.

209
00:06:45,410 --> 00:06:46,850
Like what I just said right now,

210
00:06:46,910 --> 00:06:49,580
the majority of people listening
that would watch American idol,

211
00:06:49,581 --> 00:06:50,230
but go pull,

212
00:06:50,230 --> 00:06:53,540
what the fuck are you [inaudible]
podcast is not for everybody.

213
00:06:53,541 --> 00:06:55,580
You know and this conversation
is not for everybody,

214
00:06:55,581 --> 00:06:56,870
but if you want to make a TV show,

215
00:06:57,170 --> 00:07:00,980
it kind of has to be for everybody for
the networks accepted until it becomes

216
00:07:01,220 --> 00:07:03,020
really successful or find its niche.

217
00:07:03,021 --> 00:07:03,830
And then people,

218
00:07:03,830 --> 00:07:04,920
you know like South Park,

219
00:07:05,090 --> 00:07:06,290
they can do whatever the fuck they want.

220
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:06,501
You know,

221
00:07:06,501 --> 00:07:07,910
cause it's a proven product.

222
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:09,200
If you had another show,

223
00:07:09,201 --> 00:07:13,190
we tried to make a cartoon where a gay
Guy Stuffing Paris Hilton up his ass and

224
00:07:13,191 --> 00:07:14,210
winning a sloughed off,

225
00:07:14,570 --> 00:07:16,700
they would go that's the
fuck are you talking about?

226
00:07:16,700 --> 00:07:17,870
No you can't do that.

227
00:07:17,871 --> 00:07:22,480
But South Park is so successful and is
so proven in the market that they do the

228
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:23,720
well when you show is not proven,

229
00:07:23,721 --> 00:07:24,440
you really can't.

230
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:27,230
It's hard to like have your
say as to how things get done.

231
00:07:27,231 --> 00:07:29,870
It's a complex dance and I
don't think we pulled it off,

232
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:30,441
but it's,

233
00:07:30,441 --> 00:07:32,300
it's part of the thing
of creating something,

234
00:07:32,301 --> 00:07:33,470
like when you try to create a show,

235
00:07:33,770 --> 00:07:37,700
I feel personally responsible for it
though because a lot of people got angry

236
00:07:37,701 --> 00:07:40,130
and I think a lot of that
anger could have been avoided.

237
00:07:40,490 --> 00:07:42,470
When I first started
looking at chem trails,

238
00:07:42,950 --> 00:07:43,161
uh,

239
00:07:43,161 --> 00:07:43,994
online,

240
00:07:44,150 --> 00:07:47,060
I too believe that it was a possibility.

241
00:07:47,061 --> 00:07:49,520
Like is it possible to just point
us off right in front of our face?

242
00:07:49,670 --> 00:07:50,630
They just spraying the sky.

243
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:52,390
But then the more you look into it,

244
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:52,551
you go,

245
00:07:52,551 --> 00:07:52,701
no,

246
00:07:52,701 --> 00:07:56,870
there's photos from 1980 that show these
contrail like long ones that lingered

247
00:07:56,871 --> 00:07:57,590
in the sky.

248
00:07:57,590 --> 00:07:58,190
People say,

249
00:07:58,190 --> 00:07:58,911
when we were younger,

250
00:07:58,911 --> 00:07:59,750
they didn't linger.

251
00:08:00,140 --> 00:08:00,973
Actually they did.

252
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:01,671
You just don't remember.

253
00:08:01,671 --> 00:08:02,211
Pay Attention.

254
00:08:02,211 --> 00:08:05,120
How much the fuck do you pay attention
to clouds and created by jets when you're

255
00:08:05,150 --> 00:08:05,770
eight,

256
00:08:05,770 --> 00:08:06,080
you know,

257
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:08,270
can you really tell me exactly
what the fuck do you saw?

258
00:08:08,450 --> 00:08:10,340
I barely remember shit I did last week.

259
00:08:10,370 --> 00:08:10,630
I mean,

260
00:08:10,630 --> 00:08:11,510
I'm being honest.

261
00:08:11,511 --> 00:08:13,640
I barely remember important shit.

262
00:08:13,850 --> 00:08:15,860
I did like shows that
I did that were great.

263
00:08:15,861 --> 00:08:16,790
I got a standing ovation.

264
00:08:16,791 --> 00:08:17,630
I barely remember them.

265
00:08:18,050 --> 00:08:19,070
You tell me you remember this,

266
00:08:19,071 --> 00:08:19,611
fucking,

267
00:08:19,611 --> 00:08:19,851
these,

268
00:08:19,851 --> 00:08:20,150
these,

269
00:08:20,150 --> 00:08:22,370
these contrails from when
you were eight years old.

270
00:08:22,410 --> 00:08:23,070
I remember the foot.

271
00:08:23,070 --> 00:08:23,640
Highly doubt.

272
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:25,040
It's a fucking remember that shit dude.

273
00:08:25,041 --> 00:08:25,874
I learned stuff.

274
00:08:26,090 --> 00:08:28,490
I learned some stuff from
Duane bank.com today,

275
00:08:28,491 --> 00:08:29,324
man,

276
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:30,261
forget it either.

277
00:08:30,261 --> 00:08:31,094
Man.

278
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:32,990
These people that I'm talking to,

279
00:08:32,991 --> 00:08:35,550
there's a problem with doing this show
and this is why I don't know if I'm going

280
00:08:35,560 --> 00:08:36,170
to continue doing it.

281
00:08:36,170 --> 00:08:36,710
I mean,

282
00:08:36,710 --> 00:08:37,071
first of all,

283
00:08:37,071 --> 00:08:38,570
Scifi hasn't asked me to do it again,

284
00:08:38,571 --> 00:08:39,231
but even if they do,

285
00:08:39,231 --> 00:08:40,700
I have to really think about how it's,

286
00:08:41,090 --> 00:08:42,950
I don't think I'm doing what I want to do.

287
00:08:43,190 --> 00:08:45,350
I don't think it's coming out
the way I want it to come out.

288
00:08:45,620 --> 00:08:45,951
It's,

289
00:08:45,951 --> 00:08:46,340
um,

290
00:08:46,340 --> 00:08:47,510
there's part of it that is like,

291
00:08:47,511 --> 00:08:49,220
there was an episode we
did on transhumanism.

292
00:08:49,250 --> 00:08:50,600
It's all complicated,

293
00:08:50,601 --> 00:08:52,130
the science of extending human life.

294
00:08:52,131 --> 00:08:56,490
And I love that because I got to talk to
all these super intelligent people and

295
00:08:56,491 --> 00:08:59,850
pick their brain and ask really
important to me questions.

296
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:00,773
I'd love that,

297
00:09:00,870 --> 00:09:03,540
but talking to people that are telling
me they're seeing bulletproof wolves and

298
00:09:03,541 --> 00:09:08,310
go see shit that pops out of the grids
are little wormhole and out came a

299
00:09:08,311 --> 00:09:09,540
bulletproof wolf.

300
00:09:09,870 --> 00:09:10,141
Oh,

301
00:09:10,141 --> 00:09:11,460
that sure happened.

302
00:09:11,610 --> 00:09:13,560
I'm sure you didn't have a camera and you,

303
00:09:13,561 --> 00:09:14,310
why would you,

304
00:09:14,310 --> 00:09:16,240
while you're out there
hunting for bulletproof walls,

305
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:16,981
I just,

306
00:09:16,981 --> 00:09:17,820
I got tired of it.

307
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:21,750
I got tired of talking to people that
are just crazy people or silly people or

308
00:09:22,380 --> 00:09:23,670
people that need a fucking hug.

309
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:24,600
There's a lot of that out.

310
00:09:24,670 --> 00:09:25,111
That's true.

311
00:09:25,111 --> 00:09:28,800
Hundred percent and there's also a lot
of people that really believe what they

312
00:09:28,801 --> 00:09:31,890
are saying and it's not
because they're assholes,

313
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:35,730
it's because they lack
critical thinking skills,

314
00:09:35,910 --> 00:09:37,260
whether no one's taught it to them,

315
00:09:37,261 --> 00:09:38,520
whether they've ignored them,

316
00:09:38,590 --> 00:09:39,930
whether it's the way they were raised,

317
00:09:39,931 --> 00:09:41,370
whether it's the
environment they grew up in,

318
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:43,800
whether it was the ideas they
were exposed to as a young person.

319
00:09:43,801 --> 00:09:46,500
I don't know what has caused the
situation that we're talking about,

320
00:09:46,501 --> 00:09:50,400
but there's a lot of people out there
that are thinking in a very piss poor way

321
00:09:50,401 --> 00:09:51,690
and I've been one of them in the past.

322
00:09:51,691 --> 00:09:52,250
Man,

323
00:09:52,250 --> 00:09:52,530
I've been,

324
00:09:52,530 --> 00:09:54,510
I've believed in a lot of
stupid shit in the past,

325
00:09:54,660 --> 00:09:55,493
you know that I,

326
00:09:55,710 --> 00:09:57,480
I was convinced probably was real.

327
00:09:57,480 --> 00:09:59,790
There's a thing I was talking
about this a thing called rods.

328
00:10:00,090 --> 00:10:00,451
These,

329
00:10:00,451 --> 00:10:00,780
this,

330
00:10:00,780 --> 00:10:01,620
this fucking,

331
00:10:01,621 --> 00:10:04,280
they look like jellyfish that fly
through the air faster than you can see.

332
00:10:04,290 --> 00:10:05,130
There's a whole video on them.

333
00:10:05,131 --> 00:10:05,551
Roswell,

334
00:10:05,551 --> 00:10:06,384
bronze.

335
00:10:06,390 --> 00:10:09,210
Then I watched a show called monster
quest when they showed what they really

336
00:10:09,211 --> 00:10:09,420
aren't.

337
00:10:09,420 --> 00:10:11,220
It's just a video auto fact.

338
00:10:11,460 --> 00:10:14,340
Like when you have a camera and it's
going on slow motion and something flies

339
00:10:14,341 --> 00:10:15,090
past in front of it,

340
00:10:15,090 --> 00:10:16,920
stretches the image out and make,

341
00:10:16,950 --> 00:10:17,580
it's a blur.

342
00:10:17,580 --> 00:10:18,413
It's fucking blur.

343
00:10:18,870 --> 00:10:21,780
So I was convinced that these things
were flying through the air all around us

344
00:10:21,781 --> 00:10:24,340
cause I'd seen this video and
I was like looking for him.

345
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:29,820
The guy who made this video does
not want to admit that they don't,

346
00:10:29,940 --> 00:10:30,773
they don't exist.

347
00:10:30,990 --> 00:10:31,621
Not only that,

348
00:10:31,621 --> 00:10:35,880
he actually showed up at the UFC expo
when I was doing a Q and a and he asks,

349
00:10:35,881 --> 00:10:39,330
he got in line and said he needed to
talk to me about Roswell rods and he's

350
00:10:39,331 --> 00:10:43,830
coming on my podcast because they are
real and a though those people on monster

351
00:10:43,831 --> 00:10:46,080
quest fucked him and they add,

352
00:10:46,230 --> 00:10:48,870
I don't know how they could have fucked
them because they basically showed the

353
00:10:48,871 --> 00:10:50,160
same scene.

354
00:10:50,220 --> 00:10:53,690
There was a of a campfire or a light and
a bunch of bugs were flying in front of

355
00:10:53,710 --> 00:10:55,590
light and they set two
cameras in front of it.

356
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:59,610
One of them was an HD super fast camera
to they use for like super slow mo and

357
00:10:59,611 --> 00:11:00,990
the other one was like
a regular video camera.

358
00:11:01,230 --> 00:11:03,300
Well the regular video
cameras showed these rods.

359
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:05,370
They are flying a crop
because it's an artifact.

360
00:11:05,910 --> 00:11:08,490
And if you look at how it's
flying across the video,

361
00:11:08,491 --> 00:11:09,690
it's not flying that fast.

362
00:11:09,691 --> 00:11:10,524
Like I can see it.

363
00:11:10,650 --> 00:11:12,480
So how can I not see it with my eyes,

364
00:11:12,481 --> 00:11:13,680
but I could see it on camera.

365
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:16,350
And then the other one just
showed it's just bugs judge.

366
00:11:17,020 --> 00:11:20,010
But did you see the
underwater ones and the space?

367
00:11:20,850 --> 00:11:23,730
Real theories without a doubt.

368
00:11:23,790 --> 00:11:24,360
Um,

369
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:26,640
information to government has been hiding.

370
00:11:27,030 --> 00:11:27,570
Dude,

371
00:11:27,570 --> 00:11:29,510
what you're doing right now is called you.

372
00:11:29,540 --> 00:11:32,970
You're making a plea to
ridicule rods are just tiny.

373
00:11:32,971 --> 00:11:33,804
Can trails.

374
00:11:34,310 --> 00:11:35,143
Um,

375
00:11:35,370 --> 00:11:35,731
yeah,

376
00:11:35,731 --> 00:11:35,891
they,

377
00:11:35,891 --> 00:11:36,660
they,

378
00:11:36,660 --> 00:11:38,340
they might as well do you know,

379
00:11:38,341 --> 00:11:39,510
I thought they were real man.

380
00:11:39,570 --> 00:11:40,350
I really did.

381
00:11:40,350 --> 00:11:40,640
You know,

382
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:40,821
I,

383
00:11:40,821 --> 00:11:44,250
I saw a video once it showed that there
were fucking buildings on the moon,

384
00:11:44,610 --> 00:11:48,270
like to split this lucky guy
had he like had these images.

385
00:11:48,300 --> 00:11:48,421
Oh,

386
00:11:48,421 --> 00:11:49,141
even worse than that.

387
00:11:49,141 --> 00:11:50,340
How about the face of Mars?

388
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:51,390
How about that motherfucker?

389
00:11:51,540 --> 00:11:52,590
You ever see the face on Mars?

390
00:11:52,810 --> 00:11:52,990
Yeah.

391
00:11:52,990 --> 00:11:55,630
Well there's images that
people will swear to you.

392
00:11:55,631 --> 00:11:57,430
The government is patiently doctor does.

393
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:59,710
Second more high resolution images.

394
00:11:59,890 --> 00:12:03,310
There was some photos they took for
like a long time ago of Mars and as they

395
00:12:03,311 --> 00:12:04,144
flew over Mars,

396
00:12:04,390 --> 00:12:07,030
it shows what looks like a
five sided pyramid I think,

397
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:08,350
and a face,

398
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:09,580
a face on Mars.

399
00:12:10,540 --> 00:12:12,790
Even my own friend who I loved dearly,

400
00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:16,620
Graham Hancock wrote a dumb
ass book about all this shit.

401
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:19,180
I love this friend dear
they dumb ass dumb ass.

402
00:12:19,190 --> 00:12:20,680
But he admits it was a mistake.

403
00:12:21,010 --> 00:12:21,843
He admits it,

404
00:12:22,030 --> 00:12:22,420
but shit,

405
00:12:22,420 --> 00:12:23,410
that shit's important,

406
00:12:23,411 --> 00:12:23,740
man.

407
00:12:23,740 --> 00:12:25,660
It's clearly,

408
00:12:25,661 --> 00:12:27,610
it's a faith if you look at the shape,

409
00:12:27,611 --> 00:12:28,990
but it does not appear in nature.

410
00:12:29,170 --> 00:12:31,090
This is either a two eyes pitch.

411
00:12:31,090 --> 00:12:32,800
You don't know what the
fuck you're looking at.

412
00:12:32,801 --> 00:12:33,634
Okay.

413
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:37,150
You're looking at a spot that you decide
that that's like looking at the clouds

414
00:12:37,151 --> 00:12:38,650
and thinking that you see in dragons.

415
00:12:39,070 --> 00:12:39,880
You know,

416
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:44,140
you also could be seen a fucked up
cloud because cloud's aren't perfect

417
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:45,520
symmetrical squares.

418
00:12:45,521 --> 00:12:46,354
You Shit head.

419
00:12:46,630 --> 00:12:47,110
All right,

420
00:12:47,110 --> 00:12:49,570
and you're looking at some things that
you barely tell what the fuck you're

421
00:12:49,571 --> 00:12:50,200
looking at.

422
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:53,950
Clearly it's the faith on Mars and there's
a dude who has these videos where he

423
00:12:53,951 --> 00:12:56,030
measures like these arbitrary distances,

424
00:12:56,080 --> 00:13:01,060
like a few measure from the nose to
the Left Front Center of that pyramid.

425
00:13:01,180 --> 00:13:05,080
It is the exact same distance as
the Spanx to the pyramid of Giza.

426
00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:06,041
And you're like,

427
00:13:06,041 --> 00:13:08,030
how the fuck did you
come to that conclusion?

428
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:09,753
Yes.

429
00:13:09,790 --> 00:13:13,300
If you look at it from the White House
and a 44 inch television in the corner

430
00:13:13,301 --> 00:13:16,630
where Clinton used to get
his blow jobs from that room,

431
00:13:16,631 --> 00:13:20,960
clearly the pyramid has a face on it
that looks like numbers on Mars and then,

432
00:13:21,110 --> 00:13:25,270
and people fucking buy the DVD and call
each other on the phone and do this some

433
00:13:25,271 --> 00:13:25,570
shit.

434
00:13:25,570 --> 00:13:27,760
You got to see there's a man
who's dropping some truth,

435
00:13:28,090 --> 00:13:31,330
some mad truth about the pyramid and
the next thing you know you're getting

436
00:13:31,331 --> 00:13:32,410
fucking email blasts.

437
00:13:32,411 --> 00:13:33,101
Have you seen this?

438
00:13:33,101 --> 00:13:33,821
About The pyramid?

439
00:13:33,821 --> 00:13:35,300
Like you mother fuckers,

440
00:13:36,370 --> 00:13:38,470
it's not a fucking face on the Mars.

441
00:13:38,650 --> 00:13:39,483
There might be,

442
00:13:39,830 --> 00:13:40,870
but that's not it.

443
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:41,291
I mean,

444
00:13:41,291 --> 00:13:42,190
there might be some other shit.

445
00:13:42,220 --> 00:13:43,360
It doesn't mean there's not some Osha.

446
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:44,231
It matter of fact,

447
00:13:44,231 --> 00:13:47,760
the pyramid shapes on Mars are
way more interesting than the,

448
00:13:47,761 --> 00:13:48,210
um,

449
00:13:48,210 --> 00:13:51,730
the face because the face when they show
the high resolution image of the face,

450
00:13:51,790 --> 00:13:52,870
these are been doctored,

451
00:13:52,871 --> 00:13:53,920
clearly doctored.

452
00:13:54,130 --> 00:13:56,230
These are not high resolution photographs.

453
00:13:56,231 --> 00:13:57,041
In fact they are.

454
00:13:57,041 --> 00:13:59,110
And what less than half of the gigabytes.

455
00:13:59,111 --> 00:14:04,111
And it would be if it was a true
85 gallon pickle fucking picture.

456
00:14:05,650 --> 00:14:10,060
But there are some like symmetrical
objects that exist that do look like five,

457
00:14:10,061 --> 00:14:12,990
sorry pyramids like you pull
up that because that was
kind of interesting to see

458
00:14:12,991 --> 00:14:13,240
that.

459
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:14,073
Yeah.

460
00:14:14,710 --> 00:14:17,170
But it's also possible that
those things exist naturally.

461
00:14:17,171 --> 00:14:20,080
There's a lot of weird
shapes that exist naturally.

462
00:14:20,380 --> 00:14:21,011
Like there's a,

463
00:14:21,011 --> 00:14:21,611
there's this,

464
00:14:21,611 --> 00:14:22,420
um,

465
00:14:22,420 --> 00:14:23,620
I forget what it's called.

466
00:14:23,740 --> 00:14:25,990
A giant something giant's causeway,

467
00:14:25,991 --> 00:14:26,860
I think in Ireland.

468
00:14:26,890 --> 00:14:27,760
Let me think if that's it.

469
00:14:28,330 --> 00:14:29,230
Let me see if that's it.

470
00:14:29,380 --> 00:14:32,830
But it's this crazy rock
formation that's totally natural.

471
00:14:34,420 --> 00:14:36,070
Ireland I our wind,

472
00:14:36,310 --> 00:14:37,270
I think that's what it is.

473
00:14:37,271 --> 00:14:38,320
I need to get the images here.

474
00:14:38,321 --> 00:14:38,801
Yeah,

475
00:14:38,801 --> 00:14:39,560
that's it.

476
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:40,393
Go there.

477
00:14:40,750 --> 00:14:40,961
Go,

478
00:14:40,961 --> 00:14:45,961
go to giants causeway in Ireland and
tell me this shit doesn't look like some

479
00:14:46,511 --> 00:14:48,070
mother fuckers were building a building,

480
00:14:48,310 --> 00:14:49,143
but it's not.

481
00:14:49,390 --> 00:14:50,051
It's not at all.

482
00:14:50,051 --> 00:14:51,190
It's just some weird,

483
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:53,120
crazy natural formation.

484
00:14:53,390 --> 00:14:56,060
If you saw this on an image of Mars,

485
00:14:56,090 --> 00:14:57,080
if someone sent you this,

486
00:14:57,081 --> 00:15:01,220
clearly these were cobblestones
on a a Martian street.

487
00:15:01,250 --> 00:15:02,990
They have cars like Arvs.

488
00:15:02,991 --> 00:15:04,640
They're probably shaped like us.

489
00:15:05,810 --> 00:15:06,643
Go to that.

490
00:15:06,650 --> 00:15:07,191
If you found it,

491
00:15:07,191 --> 00:15:07,820
look at these images.

492
00:15:07,820 --> 00:15:08,653
Look at this shit.

493
00:15:08,780 --> 00:15:09,320
Look at that.

494
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:10,020
Where is this?

495
00:15:10,020 --> 00:15:10,200
Oh,

496
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:11,033
this is an Ireland.

497
00:15:11,210 --> 00:15:13,070
Tell me if you saw that on Mars,

498
00:15:13,220 --> 00:15:14,840
you wouldn't start shitting your pants.

499
00:15:14,841 --> 00:15:15,100
Yeah.

500
00:15:15,100 --> 00:15:17,780
Clearly if we're so
sophisticated civilization,

501
00:15:18,530 --> 00:15:19,610
that's just natural shit.

502
00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:23,120
Perhaps aliens came down and ruin them.

503
00:15:23,690 --> 00:15:24,560
Took their women.

504
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:26,060
Look at that.

505
00:15:26,060 --> 00:15:26,301
I mean,

506
00:15:26,301 --> 00:15:27,890
that Shit looks so wow.

507
00:15:27,980 --> 00:15:29,510
That looks so unnatural.

508
00:15:29,540 --> 00:15:29,661
Yeah,

509
00:15:29,661 --> 00:15:34,190
100% it looks like someone made
a cool ass cobblestone streets,

510
00:15:34,550 --> 00:15:37,640
but it's just a natural
formation when these,

511
00:15:37,850 --> 00:15:41,570
I don't know what the fuck causes a stones
to be shaped in these weird patterns,

512
00:15:41,870 --> 00:15:42,703
but look at that.

513
00:15:42,770 --> 00:15:43,700
If you looked at that,

514
00:15:43,701 --> 00:15:47,540
you would swear that has
to be made by somebody,

515
00:15:47,570 --> 00:15:48,403
but it's not.

516
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:50,150
It's totally natural,

517
00:15:50,890 --> 00:15:51,501
you know?

518
00:15:51,501 --> 00:15:53,300
And there's varying stages of it.

519
00:15:53,301 --> 00:15:55,340
They can actually see
like how it's developed.

520
00:15:55,341 --> 00:15:55,881
I don't know.

521
00:15:55,881 --> 00:15:56,181
I'm not,

522
00:15:56,181 --> 00:15:57,014
obviously not,

523
00:15:57,410 --> 00:15:58,243
what are they called?

524
00:15:58,520 --> 00:15:59,200
What's the geologist?

525
00:15:59,200 --> 00:15:59,600
Expert?

526
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:00,980
Someone who understands rocks.

527
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:31,100
You're a fucking human being.
