1
00:00:01,540 --> 00:00:02,910
Freak bitches

2
00:00:03,390 --> 00:00:03,991
now what about,

3
00:00:03,991 --> 00:00:04,180
uh,

4
00:00:04,180 --> 00:00:05,100
other kinds of therapy,

5
00:00:05,101 --> 00:00:06,720
like a cold therapy,

6
00:00:06,721 --> 00:00:07,620
ice bass,

7
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:08,490
cryotherapy,

8
00:00:08,490 --> 00:00:09,800
things on those events.

9
00:00:10,890 --> 00:00:11,880
Prolotherapy,

10
00:00:12,410 --> 00:00:13,310
stem cell,

11
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:14,790
platelet injections.

12
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:16,673
If you could think of.

13
00:00:16,740 --> 00:00:17,460
I've done it.

14
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:18,293
I wouldn't even get in.

15
00:00:18,330 --> 00:00:21,810
I don't want your cat and your readers
to hear everything I've done because they

16
00:00:21,811 --> 00:00:22,820
would probably have me locked in.

17
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:25,020
Like what have you done that
would have you locked up?

18
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:27,270
I've used our stint and
strict nine injections.

19
00:00:27,390 --> 00:00:28,223
What?

20
00:00:28,530 --> 00:00:31,670
Strychnine strychnine or
arsenic and strychnine try.

21
00:00:31,860 --> 00:00:33,450
Why would they inject you with poison?

22
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:35,520
Because it raises your
red blood cell count.

23
00:00:37,180 --> 00:00:38,690
I've used nitric cushion cream,

24
00:00:39,020 --> 00:00:42,090
natural glycerin cream because you know,

25
00:00:42,091 --> 00:00:45,540
in a stimulate blood flow and me and
start your heart up and I use it because I

26
00:00:45,541 --> 00:00:48,570
broke my back and I didn't want to
admit I broke my back a second time.

27
00:00:48,870 --> 00:00:49,561
So I use it.

28
00:00:49,561 --> 00:00:52,320
I told my friend who was a
professor at Iowa state and says,

29
00:00:52,321 --> 00:00:53,880
don't go nowhere to see what his dust.

30
00:00:54,290 --> 00:00:55,800
I mean I was raised to
beat for three hours.

31
00:00:55,890 --> 00:00:57,510
I felt like you were hitting
me in the head every,

32
00:00:57,570 --> 00:00:58,321
every heartbeat.

33
00:00:58,321 --> 00:01:00,670
Just hit me in a temple and uh,

34
00:01:00,671 --> 00:01:00,871
so,

35
00:01:00,871 --> 00:01:01,710
but I've done it all.

36
00:01:01,740 --> 00:01:02,900
There's nothing I haven't tried.

37
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:05,350
I did lectric statement was,

38
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:08,700
it's called a microwave in
linkedin up the muscles.

39
00:01:09,220 --> 00:01:10,410
I'm Tom did it for what,

40
00:01:10,411 --> 00:01:11,244
15 seconds?

41
00:01:11,310 --> 00:01:12,840
I did it for 96 minutes.

42
00:01:13,380 --> 00:01:14,100
What does it do?

43
00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:15,330
It lengthens out the muscles.

44
00:01:15,331 --> 00:01:17,250
Leary straighten out your
leg right off the ground.

45
00:01:17,570 --> 00:01:19,300
Electrocuting you and uh,

46
00:01:19,410 --> 00:01:20,850
for six minute segments.

47
00:01:20,851 --> 00:01:22,320
And I did 96 minutes.

48
00:01:22,350 --> 00:01:26,170
So it's electrical muscular
stimulation pads lengthens it.

49
00:01:26,171 --> 00:01:26,450
So,

50
00:01:26,450 --> 00:01:28,890
and I should never done it because
I think I've got too many injuries,

51
00:01:28,891 --> 00:01:29,670
you know.

52
00:01:29,670 --> 00:01:30,270
And um,

53
00:01:30,270 --> 00:01:31,590
it basically tore.

54
00:01:31,830 --> 00:01:32,491
It popped my,

55
00:01:32,491 --> 00:01:32,880
uh,

56
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:34,620
my hips and my children's out of socket

57
00:01:38,180 --> 00:01:41,930
pop my hip bone right here.

58
00:01:43,340 --> 00:01:45,330
My hipbone you're crazy.

59
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:49,220
Your whole body is like a
walking medical encyclopedia,

60
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:50,250
you know,

61
00:01:50,250 --> 00:01:50,881
you got to try it.

62
00:01:50,881 --> 00:01:51,200
Right.

63
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:53,640
And that's me basically
geeking out on the decks.

64
00:01:54,460 --> 00:01:54,660
Yeah.

65
00:01:54,660 --> 00:01:55,493
So,

66
00:01:55,700 --> 00:01:56,780
and then Tony Trim,

67
00:01:56,840 --> 00:02:00,020
which is a Dj that
travels with him was like,

68
00:02:00,021 --> 00:02:00,321
oh dude,

69
00:02:00,321 --> 00:02:02,450
you can just get this and
you can just buy this stuff.

70
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:05,690
And that's what really got
me to do it was girl one up,

71
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:07,700
let's look at that white guy dance move.

72
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:12,571
We'll do that move.

73
00:02:12,571 --> 00:02:13,440
You're doing there.

74
00:02:13,710 --> 00:02:14,580
You're doing this.

75
00:02:15,970 --> 00:02:16,803
Yeah.

76
00:02:17,030 --> 00:02:17,190
Yeah,

77
00:02:17,190 --> 00:02:17,710
that's true.

78
00:02:17,710 --> 00:02:18,543
Just listening to you.

79
00:02:18,890 --> 00:02:19,950
What really geeked me out.

80
00:02:20,930 --> 00:02:25,930
But the name Dj Dad math came because he
was becoming a father at the time and I

81
00:02:27,001 --> 00:02:27,421
was like,

82
00:02:27,421 --> 00:02:28,780
you're like way lane bro.

83
00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:29,760
Me a dad.

84
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,020
And then it kind of
morphed into Dj data are.

85
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:35,760
But taking it onto morning news was

86
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:37,920
funny.

87
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:38,940
That was so fun.

88
00:02:38,941 --> 00:02:40,320
And I was like all the time,

89
00:02:40,590 --> 00:02:41,130
you know.

90
00:02:41,130 --> 00:02:43,800
So when you went on as a onetime goof,

91
00:02:43,950 --> 00:02:46,300
did you have a plan or
did you just not really.

92
00:02:47,330 --> 00:02:48,163
I was just like,

93
00:02:48,330 --> 00:02:51,620
the fun thing was to go was because I,

94
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:52,860
the thing that I hate the most we do.

95
00:02:52,980 --> 00:02:53,251
They're like,

96
00:02:53,251 --> 00:02:54,870
what can audiences expect this weekend?

97
00:02:55,230 --> 00:02:55,861
They always say that,

98
00:02:55,861 --> 00:02:56,040
oh,

99
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:56,580
I hate that.

100
00:02:56,580 --> 00:02:57,413
And I'm like,

101
00:02:57,450 --> 00:02:58,950
fucking show jokes.

102
00:03:00,050 --> 00:03:00,970
What do you talk about?

103
00:03:01,270 --> 00:03:01,710
Yeah,

104
00:03:01,710 --> 00:03:02,140
what's,

105
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:02,560
what's,

106
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:03,700
what's bothering you right now,

107
00:03:03,701 --> 00:03:04,150
Tom?

108
00:03:04,150 --> 00:03:04,600
Yeah,

109
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:05,261
that's the setup.

110
00:03:05,261 --> 00:03:07,720
Tell what's going on in your life and
they think you just go there and then they

111
00:03:07,721 --> 00:03:07,930
go,

112
00:03:07,930 --> 00:03:08,763
just do whatever you want.

113
00:03:08,830 --> 00:03:10,000
Like just have fun with it.

114
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:12,160
So when they do that I was just like,

115
00:03:12,630 --> 00:03:13,151
it's not really,

116
00:03:13,151 --> 00:03:14,590
I don't really give a fuck about comedy.

117
00:03:14,860 --> 00:03:15,693
And then they were like,

118
00:03:15,910 --> 00:03:16,743
what?

119
00:03:16,870 --> 00:03:17,111
I'm like,

120
00:03:17,111 --> 00:03:18,190
it's about the after party,

121
00:03:18,220 --> 00:03:18,640
you know,

122
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:20,020
I'm gonna be deejaying and why I'm here.

123
00:03:20,740 --> 00:03:22,030
Just to goof on them.

124
00:03:22,031 --> 00:03:22,161
Like,

125
00:03:22,161 --> 00:03:22,994
yeah,

126
00:03:23,020 --> 00:03:24,760
because it was fun to
have fun and be like,

127
00:03:25,030 --> 00:03:25,863
all right,

128
00:03:26,030 --> 00:03:26,950
you are at the funny bone.

129
00:03:26,951 --> 00:03:27,250
Right?

130
00:03:27,250 --> 00:03:27,490
I'm like,

131
00:03:27,490 --> 00:03:28,323
I mean for a minute,

132
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:31,200
I don't even really care about it.

133
00:03:31,210 --> 00:03:32,043
The funny bone.

134
00:03:32,190 --> 00:03:34,240
And then you have the funny bone
sitting right there off camera.

135
00:03:34,290 --> 00:03:35,123
Like

136
00:03:36,210 --> 00:03:36,880
who cares?

137
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:41,880
Like the best part is when he sets up
like the really cheesy anchors to ask him

138
00:03:42,370 --> 00:03:43,750
stupid questions.

139
00:03:44,290 --> 00:03:45,011
Like did you,

140
00:03:45,011 --> 00:03:46,840
oh you had someone do
the bird is fat thing.

141
00:03:47,140 --> 00:03:48,580
That was the best one because you know,

142
00:03:48,581 --> 00:03:50,410
if you ever add sometimes when you go,

143
00:03:50,770 --> 00:03:51,101
hey,

144
00:03:51,101 --> 00:03:51,720
um,

145
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:52,300
you know,

146
00:03:52,300 --> 00:03:54,100
asked me about farts or something,

147
00:03:54,550 --> 00:03:55,200
they'll be like,

148
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:55,690
like,

149
00:03:55,690 --> 00:03:56,160
so they,

150
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:57,460
they know not to.

151
00:03:58,090 --> 00:03:58,330
They,

152
00:03:58,330 --> 00:03:58,541
they,

153
00:03:58,541 --> 00:04:02,980
they check themselves on asking something
provocative or that's not 100 percent

154
00:04:02,981 --> 00:04:03,814
pg,

155
00:04:03,970 --> 00:04:05,500
so I didn't know how it would go,

156
00:04:05,501 --> 00:04:06,040
but I go,

157
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:06,480
oh,

158
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:07,091
asked me my bird,

159
00:04:07,091 --> 00:04:08,440
so fat and the lady goes,

160
00:04:08,590 --> 00:04:09,423
okay,

161
00:04:09,490 --> 00:04:13,270
and then so we just are in
the middle of this interview

162
00:04:14,910 --> 00:04:16,060
and she goes,

163
00:04:16,090 --> 00:04:16,591
White Bird,

164
00:04:16,591 --> 00:04:17,170
so fat.

165
00:04:17,170 --> 00:04:18,670
And I was asked a good
question and I'm like,

166
00:04:18,671 --> 00:04:19,960
I just rolled with it,

167
00:04:19,961 --> 00:04:20,440
you know,

168
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:21,460
and then it grew.

169
00:04:21,461 --> 00:04:23,320
And then a hot dog eating champion,

170
00:04:23,321 --> 00:04:25,430
a guy that was in Scotland,

171
00:04:25,450 --> 00:04:27,070
she placed tinny place.

172
00:04:27,250 --> 00:04:27,701
Yeah,

173
00:04:27,701 --> 00:04:28,534
he's like one of the,

174
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:30,910
he was like a super competitive eater,

175
00:04:30,940 --> 00:04:31,960
like a Kobiashi dude.

176
00:04:32,650 --> 00:04:36,340
This guy was assigned
to the audio on this.

177
00:04:36,750 --> 00:04:37,840
It's incredible

178
00:04:38,110 --> 00:04:39,160
life changing stuff.

179
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:40,240
Um,

180
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:42,310
I've dropped about 100
pounds in eight months.

181
00:04:42,490 --> 00:04:45,670
He dropped 100 pounds my
cheat day for the year,

182
00:04:46,990 --> 00:04:51,810
but prepping just this amazing water
which to giant inspirations first.

183
00:04:51,820 --> 00:04:54,310
My wife second anniversary today.

184
00:04:54,370 --> 00:04:55,510
So I want to say hi to her.

185
00:04:55,990 --> 00:04:56,823
And um,

186
00:04:57,130 --> 00:04:58,390
there's a comedian I love,

187
00:04:58,391 --> 00:04:59,290
he's a big,

188
00:04:59,291 --> 00:05:00,490
giant fat guy just like me,

189
00:05:00,491 --> 00:05:01,324
Bert Chrysler,

190
00:05:04,610 --> 00:05:05,850
he's still way bigger than I am.

191
00:05:07,050 --> 00:05:08,160
Maybe I can inspire him.

192
00:05:08,290 --> 00:05:09,960
We were talking about this woman,

193
00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:11,850
we didn't talk about too much,

194
00:05:11,851 --> 00:05:12,684
but we should.

195
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:17,720
This woman who was the woman that Hillary
Clinton brought up during the trump

196
00:05:18,901 --> 00:05:23,901
debate because she was saying that Donald
Trump humiliated this woman because he

197
00:05:24,271 --> 00:05:28,050
shamed her and humiliated her because she
gained weight while she was a missile.

198
00:05:28,051 --> 00:05:28,884
Olympia.

199
00:05:29,730 --> 00:05:30,421
I miss this.

200
00:05:30,421 --> 00:05:32,100
I was in the bathroom
and you guys had this.

201
00:05:32,460 --> 00:05:36,810
She got up to 170 pounds
according to trump.

202
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:39,310
She went up from like 1:22,

203
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:40,111
one slash 70.

204
00:05:40,111 --> 00:05:40,944
According to him,

205
00:05:41,070 --> 00:05:41,970
probably not right.

206
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:43,320
Probably gained like 30 pounds.

207
00:05:43,650 --> 00:05:45,990
But apparently she really
did gain a fuckload of way.

208
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:47,273
And um,

209
00:05:48,540 --> 00:05:52,610
and Hillary Clinton made this big
deal about like how awful it was.

210
00:05:52,650 --> 00:05:57,650
He did that to her and then they had
these commercials already planned for the

211
00:05:58,010 --> 00:05:58,340
next day.

212
00:05:58,340 --> 00:06:00,410
So they launched these
commercials the next day.

213
00:06:00,590 --> 00:06:02,440
And in the commercials
they show this woman,

214
00:06:02,460 --> 00:06:04,430
she's speaking in Spanish.

215
00:06:04,431 --> 00:06:06,800
You're talking about
Donald trump is terrible.

216
00:06:06,980 --> 00:06:07,940
What he do to me.

217
00:06:08,090 --> 00:06:09,470
He made me feel bad.

218
00:06:09,471 --> 00:06:10,130
He made me.

219
00:06:10,130 --> 00:06:11,030
He was scared.

220
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:15,230
So then after that comes out,

221
00:06:15,231 --> 00:06:16,550
people start researching her,

222
00:06:16,730 --> 00:06:19,670
they find out that she drove
a getaway car in a murder,

223
00:06:19,940 --> 00:06:24,440
that she threatened to judge because the
judge who is going after her boyfriend

224
00:06:24,441 --> 00:06:26,300
at the time that she
drove the getaway car,

225
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:27,860
she threatened the judge,

226
00:06:27,861 --> 00:06:29,330
said that she was going to kill the judge.

227
00:06:29,660 --> 00:06:30,770
She had an elite,

228
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:35,780
a illegitimate baby with a
Mexican kingpin drug dealer.

229
00:06:36,170 --> 00:06:40,600
All of the Mexican drug cartel kingpins
came to the baby's Christening.

230
00:06:40,970 --> 00:06:42,080
Then she went on,

231
00:06:42,081 --> 00:06:42,950
big brother,

232
00:06:43,730 --> 00:06:44,600
big brother.

233
00:06:44,630 --> 00:06:46,460
She was engaged in some baseball player,

234
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:50,750
went on big brother and fuck some other
guy on the show while the cameras were

235
00:06:50,751 --> 00:06:54,590
on her and she was yelling out in
Spanish that he has a magnificent coffee.

236
00:06:55,190 --> 00:06:56,150
Wow.

237
00:06:57,180 --> 00:07:00,250
The same lady that I
used in our commercial.

238
00:07:01,340 --> 00:07:02,820
So then they have her on CNN.

239
00:07:02,850 --> 00:07:03,210
My.

240
00:07:03,210 --> 00:07:03,620
So

241
00:07:03,620 --> 00:07:08,280
Anderson Cooper interviews on CNN and
Anderson Cooper says some people are

242
00:07:08,281 --> 00:07:12,030
saying that you threatened to judge
and that you drove a getaway car.

243
00:07:12,031 --> 00:07:12,200
Like,

244
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:13,033
is this yours?

245
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:15,180
Everybody having pass.

246
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:16,060
Okay,

247
00:07:16,060 --> 00:07:17,550
I'm not angel.

248
00:07:17,790 --> 00:07:18,780
I'm not a bad person.

249
00:07:18,930 --> 00:07:21,690
But they're trying to take
away from what he did.

250
00:07:21,691 --> 00:07:22,830
What he did was wrong.

251
00:07:23,100 --> 00:07:23,933
Okay.

252
00:07:24,030 --> 00:07:26,190
What I did was 20 years ago,

253
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:29,720
what he did was 20 years ago
to all he did was coming,

254
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:33,530
but in his defense she probably was.

255
00:07:33,650 --> 00:07:34,483
She got fat,

256
00:07:34,490 --> 00:07:35,390
so there's pictures of her.

257
00:07:35,391 --> 00:07:36,290
She definitely got fat,

258
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:37,580
but you know,

259
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:40,460
ordinarily that's a very rude thing to do,

260
00:07:40,610 --> 00:07:44,990
but when your job is to be
a professional hot chick,

261
00:07:45,620 --> 00:07:47,030
it's like if you just decide,

262
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:50,780
say like if you're a model
for like a shaving cream,

263
00:07:51,110 --> 00:07:51,931
like have you like your,

264
00:07:51,931 --> 00:07:55,670
your whole thing is about your
legs and you're showing your legs.

265
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:56,870
I touched the mic,

266
00:07:56,870 --> 00:07:57,703
sorry,

267
00:07:58,990 --> 00:08:00,740
but your thing is about your sleek,

268
00:08:00,741 --> 00:08:01,730
smooth legs and you're like,

269
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:02,810
fuck it.

270
00:08:02,810 --> 00:08:04,100
I'm letting these bitches grow.

271
00:08:04,350 --> 00:08:04,851
And everyone's like,

272
00:08:04,851 --> 00:08:05,620
hey,

273
00:08:05,620 --> 00:08:08,750
you can't do your job is to have sleek,

274
00:08:08,751 --> 00:08:09,530
smooth legs.

275
00:08:09,530 --> 00:08:09,820
No,

276
00:08:09,820 --> 00:08:12,110
it's not that you're known
for your nice flakes.

277
00:08:12,150 --> 00:08:12,680
Yeah.

278
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:15,260
She's known for being a professional,

279
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:16,670
attractive woman.

280
00:08:16,820 --> 00:08:18,860
Any holiday he shouldn't objectify women.

281
00:08:19,190 --> 00:08:21,950
That is the whole point of being Muslim.

282
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:27,310
So Hillary paid her to obviously if she's
in an anti trump commercial than that

283
00:08:27,311 --> 00:08:28,810
means hillary paid her right.

284
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:29,980
Um,

285
00:08:29,980 --> 00:08:30,790
might not be

286
00:08:30,790 --> 00:08:31,600
money.

287
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:35,470
It might just be attention because it
gave her the opportunity to get back in

288
00:08:35,471 --> 00:08:38,070
the limelight and apparently
she's a giant attention whore.

289
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:38,470
Gotcha.
