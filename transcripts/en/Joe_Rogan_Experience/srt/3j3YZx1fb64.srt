1
00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:01,051
Drive my day.

2
00:00:01,051 --> 00:00:03,720
Joe Rogan podcast by night all day.

3
00:00:04,140 --> 00:00:06,270
The early morning thing I
guess has been successful.

4
00:00:06,271 --> 00:00:06,481
Right?

5
00:00:06,481 --> 00:00:07,380
The day of the,

6
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:07,850
no,

7
00:00:07,850 --> 00:00:09,300
it's unsuccessful.

8
00:00:09,330 --> 00:00:10,770
Radically unsuccessful.

9
00:00:11,010 --> 00:00:15,270
There's been 17 different
people missing weight since you,

10
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:16,153
Oh really?

11
00:00:16,370 --> 00:00:18,720
Like one or two in the same time.

12
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:20,220
So we'll then what's this?

13
00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:22,440
Why is that then just because
they want to get the edge,

14
00:00:22,441 --> 00:00:22,891
the safety,

15
00:00:22,891 --> 00:00:23,461
safety.

16
00:00:23,461 --> 00:00:25,530
It gives people more time
to rehydrate themselves.

17
00:00:25,531 --> 00:00:28,080
But the problem is it gives them
less time to lose the weight.

18
00:00:28,110 --> 00:00:28,500
Right?

19
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:30,120
So if you're starting
off early in the morning,

20
00:00:30,121 --> 00:00:30,721
like if your,

21
00:00:30,721 --> 00:00:33,300
if your weigh ins or at four o'clock
and you know you're not going to eat all

22
00:00:33,301 --> 00:00:33,451
day,

23
00:00:33,451 --> 00:00:34,920
you're going to lose weight
all throughout the day.

24
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:37,440
But if your way ins right at
eight o'clock in the morning,

25
00:00:37,441 --> 00:00:38,400
when are you getting up?

26
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:39,450
You're going to lose all that weight.

27
00:00:39,900 --> 00:00:40,091
You know,

28
00:00:40,091 --> 00:00:40,830
you might not,

29
00:00:40,830 --> 00:00:42,150
you might not lose enough weight.

30
00:00:42,150 --> 00:00:43,950
So people are miscalculating.

31
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:48,060
There's definitely a lot
and there's definitely an
issue with people cutting too

32
00:00:48,061 --> 00:00:48,631
much weight.

33
00:00:48,631 --> 00:00:50,310
There's definitely an
issue with people doing it.

34
00:00:50,311 --> 00:00:53,850
Unhealthy Sunday be punished
or penalized even more though,

35
00:00:53,851 --> 00:00:55,940
like I just recently heard Ray Gosling,

36
00:00:55,970 --> 00:00:58,200
30% of his wealth and that's what,

37
00:00:58,201 --> 00:00:58,770
okay,

38
00:00:58,770 --> 00:00:59,491
that's fine.

39
00:00:59,491 --> 00:01:01,020
Beedamon Calvin Gospel when they admit,

40
00:01:01,170 --> 00:01:01,441
yeah,

41
00:01:01,441 --> 00:01:03,750
I haven't really been
looking after my died.

42
00:01:03,751 --> 00:01:06,060
What you're a professional
athletes signed to the,

43
00:01:06,130 --> 00:01:08,760
the biggest organization in the world.

44
00:01:08,770 --> 00:01:12,780
It shouldn't have be part of the contract
that if you're fighting for us that

45
00:01:12,781 --> 00:01:13,920
you have to maintain.

46
00:01:14,010 --> 00:01:17,070
You almost have those I instead
of even a random drug tests,

47
00:01:17,071 --> 00:01:18,560
random one random way,

48
00:01:18,750 --> 00:01:21,000
obviously they made
Calvin go up to one 85.

49
00:01:21,001 --> 00:01:21,220
Yes,

50
00:01:21,220 --> 00:01:21,771
next fight.

51
00:01:21,771 --> 00:01:23,560
And what's crazy is you looked fucking

52
00:01:25,170 --> 00:01:26,003
insane.

53
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:30,150
And Tim Kennedy blew his entire Wad
trying to take him down and beat him up.

54
00:01:30,151 --> 00:01:31,650
And they earlier the first round,

55
00:01:31,651 --> 00:01:31,861
I mean,

56
00:01:31,861 --> 00:01:32,320
he,

57
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:32,520
he,

58
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:34,290
he showed his size advantage,

59
00:01:34,291 --> 00:01:35,250
his strength advantage.

60
00:01:35,250 --> 00:01:36,210
He's a massive,

61
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:37,080
uh,

62
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:39,950
like he's a massive powerhouse when
it comes to his ground and pound his

63
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:40,793
Jujitsu.

64
00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:42,690
But Calvin just stayed the course.

65
00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:43,850
So good defense.

66
00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:45,420
And then eventually
when he got on his feet,

67
00:01:45,421 --> 00:01:49,470
man way to swift and it's how many times
does he wish now three just missed a

68
00:01:49,471 --> 00:01:50,304
bunch of,

69
00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:52,190
he missed against Tyron Woodley and,

70
00:01:52,330 --> 00:01:52,891
and beat him.

71
00:01:52,891 --> 00:01:55,590
And Tyron has a gentleman decided
to pass even take his money.

72
00:01:55,591 --> 00:01:56,160
Remember the,

73
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:57,690
which is a very fucking,

74
00:01:57,950 --> 00:01:58,410
yeah,

75
00:01:58,410 --> 00:02:01,500
ethical and moral move by the
champ now the current champ.

76
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:05,660
So he lost that and I mean there was
more than one fight in the past before

77
00:02:05,670 --> 00:02:06,503
that.

78
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:07,950
When do you say,

79
00:02:07,951 --> 00:02:08,310
okay,

80
00:02:08,310 --> 00:02:08,820
again,

81
00:02:08,820 --> 00:02:11,640
I show good career because
he's a great fighter.

82
00:02:11,641 --> 00:02:12,720
Like you say very good.

83
00:02:12,721 --> 00:02:14,280
One 85 so let's hope okay stays.

84
00:02:14,281 --> 00:02:17,880
But if what he misses way to one
85 then you should take a year.

85
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:18,713
You can,

86
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:19,710
you know,

87
00:02:19,710 --> 00:02:21,270
put the fear in them and then they,

88
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:22,280
they really going to do,

89
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:25,440
I think Calvin should fight
at 85 I mean I think he could,

90
00:02:25,441 --> 00:02:29,880
when he could win it 70 I think he can
make 70 but he doesn't always make sense.

91
00:02:30,110 --> 00:02:30,541
But you're right.

92
00:02:30,541 --> 00:02:31,260
One I think.

93
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:31,521
Yeah,

94
00:02:31,521 --> 00:02:35,610
I mean unless he wants to lose a ton of
body fat and then try fighting in one 70

95
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:35,821
you know,

96
00:02:35,821 --> 00:02:36,990
really clean his diet up.

97
00:02:36,991 --> 00:02:38,820
Really going hard on the Giardia.

98
00:02:39,690 --> 00:02:41,610
Donnie hinders does not
seem like the same person.

99
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:42,040
Oh,

100
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:42,391
what is it?

101
00:02:42,391 --> 00:02:45,780
Because of Thomson wrecking
them the way a lot of work.

102
00:02:46,340 --> 00:02:47,640
Cause I heard you say as well,

103
00:02:47,641 --> 00:02:50,540
even the Brighton like physically
just not look physically the no,

104
00:02:50,550 --> 00:02:51,960
he doesn't look like he works as hard.

105
00:02:51,990 --> 00:02:54,240
It doesn't look like he is as motivated.

106
00:02:54,241 --> 00:02:55,260
He doesn't look as hungry.

107
00:02:55,410 --> 00:02:57,030
His vaunted knock out.

108
00:02:57,030 --> 00:02:57,910
Power is gone.

109
00:02:57,911 --> 00:02:58,260
Gone,

110
00:02:58,260 --> 00:02:59,200
gone weird.

111
00:03:00,550 --> 00:03:01,300
It's weird.

112
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:01,660
Yeah.

113
00:03:01,660 --> 00:03:03,790
I wanted it to him and I
should a long time ago,

114
00:03:03,870 --> 00:03:05,380
if I was just coaching with his tie,

115
00:03:05,381 --> 00:03:08,560
his left hand to his body and
it put him after every workout,

116
00:03:08,561 --> 00:03:10,390
you go three or four rounds on the back,

117
00:03:10,660 --> 00:03:10,991
you know,

118
00:03:10,991 --> 00:03:12,130
just using your right hand.

119
00:03:12,131 --> 00:03:15,040
Can you imagine if he developed
a right hand on top of that?

120
00:03:15,210 --> 00:03:15,420
Yeah.

121
00:03:15,420 --> 00:03:17,410
I mean because it was 90% was left,

122
00:03:17,590 --> 00:03:19,060
you know you would that,

123
00:03:19,270 --> 00:03:19,631
you know,

124
00:03:19,631 --> 00:03:20,980
now you open a whole new door,

125
00:03:20,981 --> 00:03:21,580
you know,

126
00:03:21,580 --> 00:03:25,180
you know and it's an unfair to question
someone whether or not they tested

127
00:03:25,181 --> 00:03:26,170
positive for anything.

128
00:03:26,171 --> 00:03:26,891
If they are,

129
00:03:26,891 --> 00:03:27,880
whenever I took anything.

130
00:03:27,881 --> 00:03:29,110
If you haven't tested positive.

131
00:03:29,290 --> 00:03:30,970
So he never tested positive for anything.

132
00:03:30,971 --> 00:03:32,440
So you can't look at it
to I don't think he did.

133
00:03:32,441 --> 00:03:34,720
Did he know maybe a diuretic or something?

134
00:03:35,250 --> 00:03:35,711
Maybe.

135
00:03:35,711 --> 00:03:36,280
Maybe.

136
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:39,100
I have no find out of Johnny Hendricks
ever tested positive for something.

137
00:03:39,101 --> 00:03:39,934
I don't think he did.

138
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:40,631
So you know,

139
00:03:40,631 --> 00:03:43,640
there's a lot of people
throwing accusations about
him and George St Pierre was

140
00:03:43,910 --> 00:03:44,430
peers.

141
00:03:44,430 --> 00:03:47,230
Do you know what it costs will be like
one of the things he said about his last

142
00:03:47,231 --> 00:03:47,471
fight,

143
00:03:47,471 --> 00:03:49,800
he said he'd worked out
for four times a week,

144
00:03:49,820 --> 00:03:50,360
week,

145
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:51,640
a one time,

146
00:03:51,641 --> 00:03:52,391
four times a week.

147
00:03:52,391 --> 00:03:52,631
He's like,

148
00:03:52,631 --> 00:03:54,640
he just was not focused on that fight.

149
00:03:55,210 --> 00:03:56,230
If that's the case,

150
00:03:56,231 --> 00:03:56,800
you've got to get out.

151
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:57,760
That's why he looks like that.

152
00:03:57,761 --> 00:03:59,860
It has nothing to do with
you saw it or anything else.

153
00:03:59,861 --> 00:04:01,110
He just doesn't have the hunger anymore.

154
00:04:01,650 --> 00:04:02,490
That's where you,

155
00:04:02,650 --> 00:04:04,090
you put yourself at great risk,

156
00:04:04,450 --> 00:04:06,520
but also mentally going into the fight.

157
00:04:06,521 --> 00:04:09,700
If you know that is not a guy trained
10 times a week and you've trained for,

158
00:04:10,180 --> 00:04:11,170
what are you going to do with four?

159
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:13,180
It's just weird that his power went away.

160
00:04:13,380 --> 00:04:13,780
Yes.

161
00:04:13,780 --> 00:04:15,910
I mean he used to make ice crumble.

162
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:16,953
He's to let me,

163
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:18,700
when you hit John Fitch and went flying,

164
00:04:18,770 --> 00:04:20,110
Martin Kampmann flying,

165
00:04:20,290 --> 00:04:21,123
went flying.

166
00:04:21,390 --> 00:04:24,100
It was like he had magic in his hands
and then all of a sudden it stopped.

167
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:25,013
Yup.

168
00:04:25,030 --> 00:04:27,920
So what the fuck don't
have to be a monkey thing.

169
00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:32,050
And really just ruined him.

170
00:04:32,650 --> 00:04:32,861
Yeah.

171
00:04:32,861 --> 00:04:33,680
He fucked them up.

172
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:34,170
Yeah.

173
00:04:34,170 --> 00:04:37,990
And you fucked him up and he fucked him
up with like using that front leg side

174
00:04:37,991 --> 00:04:39,310
kick and then the front leg round kiss.

175
00:04:39,420 --> 00:04:39,881
What'd he hit?

176
00:04:39,881 --> 00:04:40,300
A Bat?

177
00:04:40,300 --> 00:04:41,051
One to the body.

178
00:04:41,051 --> 00:04:45,070
And then Johnny like black nods his head
like you got me and then slap the same

179
00:04:45,071 --> 00:04:45,970
one right up to the face.

180
00:04:45,971 --> 00:04:46,530
Yep.

181
00:04:46,530 --> 00:04:47,540
And that's the thing we would want.

182
00:04:47,590 --> 00:04:48,101
We want to buy.

183
00:04:48,101 --> 00:04:48,934
He makes it,

184
00:04:48,970 --> 00:04:49,440
oh yeah.

185
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:49,991
Perfectly.

186
00:04:49,991 --> 00:04:52,050
And then it suddenly your hook
kick and a question mark again.

187
00:04:52,070 --> 00:04:53,290
It's every time it's a different cake.

188
00:04:53,420 --> 00:04:53,830
Yeah.

189
00:04:53,830 --> 00:04:53,981
Hey,

190
00:04:53,981 --> 00:04:54,761
don't know what's going to come.

191
00:04:54,761 --> 00:04:56,840
Mr [inaudible] and Glenn
Berger Talk Shit about him.

192
00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:58,150
All the spinning kicks.

193
00:04:58,151 --> 00:04:59,100
It's a waste of energy.

194
00:04:59,150 --> 00:04:59,440
So,

195
00:04:59,440 --> 00:04:59,621
oh,

196
00:04:59,621 --> 00:05:00,160
for real.

197
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:00,993
Check this shit out.

198
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:01,451
I mean,

199
00:05:01,451 --> 00:05:04,180
you don't think it's a coincidence that
he will kicked Ellenberger in the head

200
00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:05,020
twice?

201
00:05:05,020 --> 00:05:05,310
Yeah.

202
00:05:05,310 --> 00:05:05,770
I go,

203
00:05:05,770 --> 00:05:06,730

204
00:05:06,731 --> 00:05:07,031
dude.

205
00:05:07,031 --> 00:05:07,160
Right?

206
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:07,600
Yeah.

207
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:07,871
Yeah.

208
00:05:07,871 --> 00:05:08,291
It's not,

209
00:05:08,291 --> 00:05:08,861
it's not a waste.

210
00:05:08,861 --> 00:05:10,630
It's some fucking super good at this.

211
00:05:15,020 --> 00:05:18,280
[inaudible]

212
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:20,790
