1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:00,780
Holder.

2
00:00:00,780 --> 00:00:01,710
I mean they're both older.

3
00:00:01,711 --> 00:00:05,100
I think Johnny's probably 37
in Lombard is older than that.

4
00:00:05,101 --> 00:00:07,440
I think Johnny's only 32.

5
00:00:08,520 --> 00:00:09,353
So we just said,

6
00:00:09,950 --> 00:00:10,080
oh,

7
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:10,800
you said we're live.

8
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:11,633
Oh,

9
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:13,890
we're trying to figure out
how old Johnny Hendricks says.

10
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:14,873
Ladies and gentlemen,

11
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:16,380
I'm guessing probably,

12
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:17,130
uh,

13
00:00:17,130 --> 00:00:21,810
Eddie bravos and how Ian Mccall is here.

14
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:22,733
How's it going guys?

15
00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:25,800
This is a fight companion podcast
if you've never heard one of these.

16
00:00:26,130 --> 00:00:28,410
Most of the time we don't
talk about the fights.

17
00:00:28,610 --> 00:00:29,443
I had to wear it sense.

18
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:29,791
Yes.

19
00:00:29,791 --> 00:00:32,280
But we are watching the fights and a,

20
00:00:32,281 --> 00:00:35,190
we will tell you when it
syncs up to the first fight.

21
00:00:35,191 --> 00:00:38,460
This is a UFC fight
night live from Halifax.

22
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:43,760
It's Johnny Hendricks versus Hector
Lombard and Travis Browne versus a Derrick

23
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:46,050
Lewis.

24
00:00:46,050 --> 00:00:46,471
So,

25
00:00:46,471 --> 00:00:46,651
uh,

26
00:00:46,651 --> 00:00:49,140
that's a big heavyweight
bout very important fights.

27
00:00:49,141 --> 00:00:50,040
Another scary guy.

28
00:00:50,041 --> 00:00:51,480
Derrick Lewis has been frightening lately.

29
00:00:51,630 --> 00:00:52,281
He looks good.

30
00:00:52,281 --> 00:00:52,680
Damn.

31
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:53,460
He looks really good.

32
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:54,420
I was super impressed with them.

33
00:00:54,421 --> 00:00:55,350
Against Roy Nelson.

34
00:00:55,370 --> 00:00:55,590
Yeah.

35
00:00:55,590 --> 00:00:57,300
He's got all sorts of endurance now.

36
00:00:57,301 --> 00:01:00,270
He's been like really concentrating
on is a strength and conditioning.

37
00:01:00,930 --> 00:01:01,211
Yeah.

38
00:01:01,211 --> 00:01:01,381
For,

39
00:01:01,381 --> 00:01:03,450
for a man that size to carry that sort of,

40
00:01:03,540 --> 00:01:04,373
you know,

41
00:01:04,620 --> 00:01:06,260
just to carry that body
over that amount of time.

42
00:01:06,261 --> 00:01:07,110
So yeah,

43
00:01:07,111 --> 00:01:07,560
he's,

44
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:09,030
he's definitely worked on a lot.

45
00:01:09,330 --> 00:01:09,661
Hey man,

46
00:01:09,661 --> 00:01:10,680
before we even get going,

47
00:01:10,681 --> 00:01:13,140
we should talk about your
last thing because you've,

48
00:01:13,410 --> 00:01:16,620
you are the most cursed
fucking dude in all of MMA.

49
00:01:16,621 --> 00:01:19,560
He just had to cancel.

50
00:01:19,620 --> 00:01:21,060
How many fights in a row is this now?

51
00:01:21,390 --> 00:01:21,900
Five.

52
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:22,700
Five fights in a row.

53
00:01:22,700 --> 00:01:23,970
That's crazy.

54
00:01:24,530 --> 00:01:25,650
That is crazy.

55
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:28,980
It's gotten to the point where
obviously people are pissed off.

56
00:01:28,981 --> 00:01:30,810
They're hating on me or fuck or whatever.

57
00:01:30,811 --> 00:01:31,141
I don't really,

58
00:01:31,141 --> 00:01:31,980
we can't worry about that,

59
00:01:31,981 --> 00:01:32,721
but just explain,

60
00:01:32,721 --> 00:01:33,930
but explain what happened.

61
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:35,250
So the,

62
00:01:35,290 --> 00:01:35,671
the,

63
00:01:35,671 --> 00:01:37,200
you want to go from the
very beginning made weight.

64
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:38,131
He made way you look,

65
00:01:38,131 --> 00:01:38,881
you were smiling,

66
00:01:38,881 --> 00:01:40,400
you were laughing and saw the video.

67
00:01:40,401 --> 00:01:43,020
I've never made weight that
easy in my entire career.

68
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:43,531
That was,

69
00:01:43,531 --> 00:01:45,720
I mean you ask anybody the usually,

70
00:01:45,721 --> 00:01:45,960
you know,

71
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:48,690
you stopped drinking water
24 hours out from Wayne's,

72
00:01:49,890 --> 00:01:50,401
well,

73
00:01:50,401 --> 00:01:51,350
I cut weight the night,

74
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:51,991
that night,

75
00:01:51,991 --> 00:01:53,900
Thursday night and I,

76
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:58,980
it was going so well that I had
probably five glasses of ice water.

77
00:01:59,040 --> 00:01:59,420
Oh Shit.

78
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:00,540
Pop is the first fight.

79
00:02:00,541 --> 00:02:03,180
So you bet to get us are gonna be excited
to get cracking with a stupid story.

80
00:02:03,181 --> 00:02:05,250
So then I figured,

81
00:02:05,251 --> 00:02:05,601
fuck I can,

82
00:02:05,601 --> 00:02:06,301
I can eat a little bit.

83
00:02:06,301 --> 00:02:08,490
So I try to eat a little bit
of salad and I threw that up,

84
00:02:08,670 --> 00:02:09,900
but I figured that was just the,

85
00:02:09,901 --> 00:02:10,111
uh,

86
00:02:10,111 --> 00:02:10,920
just the,

87
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:11,420
the,

88
00:02:11,420 --> 00:02:14,130
the dressing or something that
there was messing my stomach up.

89
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:14,460
Right.

90
00:02:14,460 --> 00:02:16,100
So I had at least a cup of a,

91
00:02:16,101 --> 00:02:16,930
of almonds,

92
00:02:16,930 --> 00:02:17,191
a lot,

93
00:02:17,191 --> 00:02:18,030
five cups of water.

94
00:02:18,030 --> 00:02:19,260
I cut the rest in the morning.

95
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:21,930
And then when I was trying
to gain any weight back,

96
00:02:21,931 --> 00:02:22,710
my body wouldn't,

97
00:02:22,710 --> 00:02:23,370
I couldn't,

98
00:02:23,370 --> 00:02:24,480
I couldn't hold on to anything.

99
00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:25,530
He just kept throwing up.

100
00:02:25,530 --> 00:02:26,430
I kept throwing up everything.

101
00:02:26,431 --> 00:02:26,951
So you have,

102
00:02:26,951 --> 00:02:31,740
see I woke up Saturday
morning at one 31 should,

103
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:35,220
I had only gained five pounds and four
of those pounds had been because UFC gave

104
00:02:35,221 --> 00:02:36,054
me two ivy bags.

105
00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:37,080
And how much did you cut?

106
00:02:37,110 --> 00:02:38,910
The UFC gave you ivy bags?

107
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:39,330
Yeah.

108
00:02:39,330 --> 00:02:40,163
Wait a minute.

109
00:02:40,650 --> 00:02:42,120
You are allowed to use an IV?

110
00:02:42,390 --> 00:02:42,721
Yeah,

111
00:02:42,721 --> 00:02:43,330
because they were just,

112
00:02:43,330 --> 00:02:45,020
they would do that.

113
00:02:45,030 --> 00:02:45,900
I'd go to the fucking hospital,

114
00:02:45,990 --> 00:02:46,800
but hold on a second.

115
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:48,630
I thought you can't use
an ivy and then fight.

116
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:49,231
Well,

117
00:02:49,231 --> 00:02:49,411
no,

118
00:02:49,411 --> 00:02:49,541
they,

119
00:02:49,541 --> 00:02:49,780
they,

120
00:02:49,780 --> 00:02:50,800
they were just doing it as,

121
00:02:50,810 --> 00:02:52,620
as a precaution because either
way I was gonna need it.

122
00:02:52,780 --> 00:02:53,011
Right.

123
00:02:53,011 --> 00:02:53,370
But,

124
00:02:53,370 --> 00:02:56,910
but isn't that the whole thing about
cutting weight is that it's much more

125
00:02:56,911 --> 00:02:58,890
difficult now because you can't use an IV.

126
00:02:58,930 --> 00:03:00,460
So they gave you an exemption.

127
00:03:00,670 --> 00:03:02,020
I got so some sort of an exemption,

128
00:03:02,021 --> 00:03:04,780
but I didn't even have to get an exemption
because I ended up getting pulled.

129
00:03:04,781 --> 00:03:05,381
Does anybody know?

130
00:03:05,381 --> 00:03:06,214
But is this like a new,

131
00:03:06,340 --> 00:03:09,560
is this like the first time
anyone's hearing this that
you did an ivy get yelled

132
00:03:09,570 --> 00:03:10,100
at?

133
00:03:10,100 --> 00:03:10,933
Um,

134
00:03:11,260 --> 00:03:12,021
what do you mean yelled at by?

135
00:03:12,021 --> 00:03:13,100
Who People Online.

136
00:03:13,101 --> 00:03:14,350
Is that what you're saying about UFC?

137
00:03:15,310 --> 00:03:15,761
UFC?

138
00:03:15,761 --> 00:03:16,290
Like who,

139
00:03:16,290 --> 00:03:16,481
oh no,

140
00:03:16,481 --> 00:03:16,601
no,

141
00:03:16,601 --> 00:03:17,410
I'm just kidding.

142
00:03:17,410 --> 00:03:19,600
But who said that you could do the ivy?

143
00:03:19,690 --> 00:03:19,901
Oh,

144
00:03:19,901 --> 00:03:21,100
Jeff came up to my room.

145
00:03:21,130 --> 00:03:21,570
Jeff.

146
00:03:21,570 --> 00:03:22,000
Yeah,

147
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:22,600
Jeff Novitsky.

148
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:26,980
So this jet you have this key doctor d
like they all were with me the entire

149
00:03:26,981 --> 00:03:27,580
time.

150
00:03:27,580 --> 00:03:30,100
I made weight so easily that it was,

151
00:03:30,130 --> 00:03:33,280
it was crazy because anything I'd
put in my body I'd throw back up.

152
00:03:33,460 --> 00:03:34,360
So what the fuck man,

153
00:03:34,361 --> 00:03:34,810
can you use it?

154
00:03:34,810 --> 00:03:36,630
You can use an ivy or you can't use an ob.

155
00:03:36,631 --> 00:03:37,464
He's an ivy.

156
00:03:37,870 --> 00:03:38,950
You get the exemption,

157
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:40,810
which I don't know the rules.

158
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:41,710
And then again,

159
00:03:41,711 --> 00:03:42,730
I was also sick the whole time,

160
00:03:42,731 --> 00:03:43,720
so I don't what the fuck was going on.

161
00:03:45,430 --> 00:03:46,360
And then,

162
00:03:46,361 --> 00:03:46,680
you know,

163
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:46,800
they,

164
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:48,520
they gave me the two ivy bags.

165
00:03:48,550 --> 00:03:52,090
I ingested maybe a pound of
water or whatever myself.

166
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:53,710
That's the only thing I keep down.

167
00:03:53,790 --> 00:03:54,390
But like I said,

168
00:03:54,390 --> 00:03:56,170
I buy by the next morning,

169
00:03:56,350 --> 00:03:57,220
you still hadn't eaten.

170
00:03:57,310 --> 00:03:57,491
I,

171
00:03:57,491 --> 00:03:57,710
it's,

172
00:03:57,710 --> 00:03:57,950
I,

173
00:03:57,950 --> 00:03:59,330
it's still only gain five pounds.

174
00:03:59,350 --> 00:03:59,511
So,

175
00:03:59,511 --> 00:04:00,191
but you'd only eat,

176
00:04:00,191 --> 00:04:00,911
drink water.

177
00:04:00,911 --> 00:04:01,990
You hadn't eaten anything,

178
00:04:01,991 --> 00:04:03,760
but I was born and I hadn't
eaten any of everything.

179
00:04:03,770 --> 00:04:04,331
I tried to eat.

180
00:04:04,331 --> 00:04:05,950
I threw up and I was throwing
up in front of all the,

181
00:04:05,951 --> 00:04:07,030
all the other fighters,

182
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:09,700
every single chance we ended up
had to be in a group in public.

183
00:04:09,700 --> 00:04:10,690
I ended up fucking throwing up.

184
00:04:11,590 --> 00:04:14,620
So then you go to the doctor
I the next day I'm like,

185
00:04:14,621 --> 00:04:14,921
okay,

186
00:04:14,921 --> 00:04:15,491
give me two more.

187
00:04:15,491 --> 00:04:16,260
I'd be bags.

188
00:04:16,260 --> 00:04:18,670
Give me some Zofran for ivy backs total.

189
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:20,410
I asked what I ended up getting more,

190
00:04:20,590 --> 00:04:21,280
but um,

191
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:22,360
I asked him and I'm like,

192
00:04:22,361 --> 00:04:22,661
listen,

193
00:04:22,661 --> 00:04:22,811
like,

194
00:04:22,811 --> 00:04:23,740
just let me fight.

195
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:24,490
Give me,

196
00:04:24,490 --> 00:04:25,060
give me,

197
00:04:25,060 --> 00:04:26,260
give me two more heavy bags,

198
00:04:26,290 --> 00:04:26,600
condition,

199
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:29,110
Zofran so I can go brown
to help your stomach.

200
00:04:29,530 --> 00:04:30,970
So then I can hold some food down,

201
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,260
some antinausea stuff.

202
00:04:32,410 --> 00:04:33,490
And they looked at me like,

203
00:04:33,491 --> 00:04:34,300
no dude,

204
00:04:34,300 --> 00:04:35,590
you need to go to the hospital.

205
00:04:35,630 --> 00:04:36,370
Like,

206
00:04:36,370 --> 00:04:37,203
and then they fade out.

207
00:04:37,210 --> 00:04:39,220
Then they were going to do
emergency gallbladder surgery,

208
00:04:39,221 --> 00:04:40,060
which they didn't have to do.

209
00:04:40,061 --> 00:04:40,920
Then go hats.

210
00:04:41,090 --> 00:04:41,680
Um,

211
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:42,970
emergency gallbladder surgery.

212
00:04:42,971 --> 00:04:43,361
Like what?

213
00:04:43,361 --> 00:04:44,310
Remove your gallbladder.

214
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:47,740
They've did this whole thing
is scared the shit out of me.

215
00:04:47,900 --> 00:04:48,610
Like,

216
00:04:48,610 --> 00:04:48,910
what,

217
00:04:48,910 --> 00:04:49,190
what,

218
00:04:49,190 --> 00:04:50,140
what did you sit on it up?

219
00:04:50,150 --> 00:04:50,351
She says,

220
00:04:50,351 --> 00:04:50,480
Oh,

221
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:50,741
you know,

222
00:04:50,741 --> 00:04:51,760
you could die and never know.

223
00:04:51,761 --> 00:04:52,031
I'm like,

224
00:04:52,031 --> 00:04:52,810
what in the fuck do you mean?

225
00:04:52,810 --> 00:04:53,500
You never know.

226
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:55,810
So when they say emergency
gallbladder surgery,

227
00:04:55,811 --> 00:04:56,111
they're like,

228
00:04:56,111 --> 00:04:57,490
what is going on with your broader,

229
00:04:57,550 --> 00:04:58,360
like what would they say?

230
00:04:58,360 --> 00:04:59,290
It was super,

231
00:04:59,291 --> 00:05:00,124
uh,

232
00:05:00,130 --> 00:05:01,510
it was what was shrunk,

233
00:05:01,540 --> 00:05:02,740
I guess when you say contracted,

234
00:05:02,860 --> 00:05:05,200
just from the dehydration I guess.

235
00:05:05,230 --> 00:05:09,550
And then so then they saw shadowing and
some other stuff and they thought I had,

236
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:10,330
you know,

237
00:05:10,330 --> 00:05:10,840
the gallbladder,

238
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:11,950
they thought I had gallstones.

239
00:05:12,250 --> 00:05:12,960
So then the Aza,

240
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:14,590
as they're trying to set everything up,

241
00:05:14,591 --> 00:05:14,740
they go,

242
00:05:14,740 --> 00:05:16,390
well let's get a more in depth,

243
00:05:16,391 --> 00:05:18,130
the more advanced version
of what we just did.

244
00:05:18,540 --> 00:05:19,720
So then they took me in the back,

245
00:05:19,750 --> 00:05:21,610
hit me with a bunch of
morphine and I'm like,

246
00:05:21,611 --> 00:05:23,440
if you have to dig anything
in my stomach again,

247
00:05:23,441 --> 00:05:24,130
I'm gonna Punch him.

248
00:05:24,130 --> 00:05:24,251
Like,

249
00:05:24,251 --> 00:05:27,830
so just at least knock me out and a bunch
of morphine and sent me on the table.

250
00:05:27,831 --> 00:05:28,980
What is your gallbladder do?

251
00:05:29,090 --> 00:05:30,910
I don't know if you know toxins,

252
00:05:30,970 --> 00:05:31,300
right?

253
00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:32,650
I thought that was where your liver does.

254
00:05:33,580 --> 00:05:34,790
Does the gallbladder do that as well?

255
00:05:34,791 --> 00:05:34,930
If,

256
00:05:34,930 --> 00:05:35,290
I don't know,

257
00:05:35,290 --> 00:05:37,150
does anybody know what a gallbladder does?

258
00:05:37,330 --> 00:05:38,770
It's one of those things
where if you had a name,

259
00:05:38,771 --> 00:05:39,810
like a crucial Oregon's,

260
00:05:39,811 --> 00:05:40,331
you'd go,

261
00:05:40,331 --> 00:05:41,060
uh,

262
00:05:41,060 --> 00:05:41,893
I think we got them.

263
00:05:42,850 --> 00:05:43,260
What's that?

264
00:05:43,260 --> 00:05:44,080
Yes,

265
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:44,920
exactly.

266
00:05:45,190 --> 00:05:48,460
So then they do a more
advanced version of the,

267
00:05:48,490 --> 00:05:48,730
uh,

268
00:05:48,730 --> 00:05:50,500
of the ultrasound and
they didn't see anything,

269
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:51,550
so I didn't have to do that.

270
00:05:52,180 --> 00:05:54,640
And so basically we're just running tests.

271
00:05:54,641 --> 00:05:55,690
I've been running tests all week.

272
00:05:56,170 --> 00:05:58,430
So your gallbladder is obviously,

273
00:05:58,460 --> 00:06:00,500
there's an issue because
of the dehydration,

274
00:06:00,501 --> 00:06:01,040
like yes,

275
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:01,940
it was falling apart.

276
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:02,670
Yeah.

277
00:06:02,670 --> 00:06:03,680
So that sucked.

278
00:06:03,690 --> 00:06:04,523
And then,

279
00:06:04,610 --> 00:06:04,881
I mean,

280
00:06:04,881 --> 00:06:05,360
I didn't,

281
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:06,260
I wasn't even,

282
00:06:06,740 --> 00:06:07,640
I'm still skinny,

283
00:06:07,790 --> 00:06:08,241
but I,

284
00:06:08,241 --> 00:06:08,540
I think,

285
00:06:08,540 --> 00:06:08,991
I mean,

286
00:06:08,991 --> 00:06:09,920
I hadn't been,

287
00:06:10,250 --> 00:06:15,140
I went home a day later and I was supposed
to go home and I was still under 135

288
00:06:15,141 --> 00:06:15,440
pounds.

289
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:16,520
It's probably 132 pounds.

290
00:06:16,550 --> 00:06:17,990
And will you eating by then?

291
00:06:18,020 --> 00:06:21,230
I wasn't able to hold food
down until like Tuesday.

292
00:06:21,860 --> 00:06:25,250
I think it was so good in my body.

293
00:06:25,251 --> 00:06:26,570
Just fucking failed me.

294
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:26,910
Okay.

295
00:06:26,910 --> 00:06:28,090
Make that a little larger please.

296
00:06:28,091 --> 00:06:28,730
It says,

297
00:06:28,730 --> 00:06:29,660
when is that?

298
00:06:29,710 --> 00:06:29,930
Uh,

299
00:06:29,930 --> 00:06:34,250
when is the Tue not required for an ivy
infusion if the athlete has an acute

300
00:06:34,251 --> 00:06:37,520
medical condition where an ivy lines
essential for treatment in the hospital

301
00:06:37,521 --> 00:06:40,940
admission surgical procedure
or clinical investigation.

302
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:44,990
Examples of be a severely dehydrated
athlete with signs of circulatory

303
00:06:44,991 --> 00:06:45,824
compromise.

304
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:47,333
Hmm.

305
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:52,760
A need for an ivy line during a
surgical procedure and an IV line in the

306
00:06:52,851 --> 00:06:54,890
antibiotic treatment
of an acute infection,

307
00:06:54,910 --> 00:06:55,550
et cetera.

308
00:06:55,550 --> 00:06:58,040
So I guess they decided
they made a judgement call.

309
00:06:58,460 --> 00:07:00,690
They decided but they were going
to let you fight with an IV,

310
00:07:00,691 --> 00:07:01,580
which is kinda crazy.

311
00:07:01,581 --> 00:07:03,500
I think they kind of knew I wasn't
going to fight the whole time.

312
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:05,030
They were just a really
pat me on the head.

313
00:07:05,031 --> 00:07:05,241
That one.

314
00:07:05,241 --> 00:07:05,461
Oh yeah,

315
00:07:05,461 --> 00:07:05,900
you'll be all right.

316
00:07:05,900 --> 00:07:06,580
Little Buddy.

317
00:07:06,580 --> 00:07:09,770
So you think they're giving you the ivy
just to make you stay alive or some just

318
00:07:09,771 --> 00:07:13,820
to keep me not nine cry fucking hate
weight cutting with every ounce of my

319
00:07:13,821 --> 00:07:14,590
being.

320
00:07:14,590 --> 00:07:18,200
The really difficult part is I had the
best weight cut of my let you didn't you,

321
00:07:18,210 --> 00:07:21,800
you had the best weight cut of your
life where you obviously got down to 125

322
00:07:21,801 --> 00:07:22,280
pounds,

323
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:23,720
but your body was shutting down.

324
00:07:23,990 --> 00:07:24,201
I mean,

325
00:07:24,201 --> 00:07:26,180
you can't say I had the
best weight cut of my life.

326
00:07:26,181 --> 00:07:27,140
If you almost died,

327
00:07:27,390 --> 00:07:27,981
you have a point.

328
00:07:27,981 --> 00:07:28,451
I mean it's,

329
00:07:28,451 --> 00:07:30,540
it's the whole thing
is so until that point,

330
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:31,270
up until that point.

331
00:07:31,270 --> 00:07:31,970
Yes,

332
00:07:31,970 --> 00:07:32,451
exactly.

333
00:07:32,451 --> 00:07:36,890
It's so bananas at the fucking
practice of weight cutting is so crazy.

334
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:37,191
Yeah.

335
00:07:37,191 --> 00:07:40,700
And of course there's something still
tied to what happened in Ireland with me

336
00:07:40,730 --> 00:07:41,630
and most people don't know.

337
00:07:41,630 --> 00:07:43,790
But I was in the hospital two,

338
00:07:43,791 --> 00:07:44,001
three,

339
00:07:44,001 --> 00:07:48,080
four times before that fight with
some Vasovagal syncope where my,

340
00:07:48,110 --> 00:07:48,381
my,

341
00:07:48,381 --> 00:07:48,590
uh,

342
00:07:48,590 --> 00:07:49,460
my esophagus would,

343
00:07:50,210 --> 00:07:52,730
would freak out and I've
done it passing out.

344
00:07:52,940 --> 00:07:54,590
And this is before the weight cut.

345
00:07:54,630 --> 00:07:55,463
This is before,

346
00:07:55,580 --> 00:07:57,410
this is in training camp
for the Ireland fight.

347
00:07:57,860 --> 00:07:59,780
And then what causes that?

348
00:07:59,810 --> 00:08:00,643
I don't fucking know.

349
00:08:00,740 --> 00:08:01,910
I've been trying to get tests done.

350
00:08:01,911 --> 00:08:03,170
They've have had endoscopy.

351
00:08:03,171 --> 00:08:04,160
I gotta get another camera.

352
00:08:04,161 --> 00:08:06,140
He'll be down my throat
pipe sticking out of my ass.

353
00:08:06,470 --> 00:08:07,640
And you were like,

354
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:08,900
I'm just going to fight anyway.

355
00:08:09,620 --> 00:08:10,280
Yeah.

356
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:10,880
Whoa.

357
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:11,780
That's what I liked doing.

358
00:08:12,110 --> 00:08:12,591
I understand.

359
00:08:12,591 --> 00:08:13,320
I'd rather do this.

360
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:13,600
Okay.

361
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:15,200
This fight is about to start.

362
00:08:15,201 --> 00:08:17,780
So let's go with the very first round.

363
00:08:17,990 --> 00:08:18,350
Um,

364
00:08:18,350 --> 00:08:21,050
could we get the card up on the screen
so we could tell who's fighting here?

365
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:22,120
Felder is so much fun.

366
00:08:22,550 --> 00:08:22,731
Yeah,

367
00:08:22,731 --> 00:08:23,564
he's great.

368
00:08:23,630 --> 00:08:23,941
He's,

369
00:08:23,941 --> 00:08:24,681
he's exciting.

370
00:08:24,681 --> 00:08:25,341
And homeboy.

371
00:08:25,341 --> 00:08:26,870
Who was he fighting Ricci.

372
00:08:27,350 --> 00:08:27,741
Oh,

373
00:08:27,741 --> 00:08:29,540
we tagged him right away
with a left counter hook.

374
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:30,141
What is,

375
00:08:30,141 --> 00:08:30,974
um,

376
00:08:31,610 --> 00:08:32,840
what's reaches full name

377
00:08:35,860 --> 00:08:36,100
reach?

378
00:08:36,100 --> 00:08:39,430
He's got the old school
tie tattoos on his back.

379
00:08:39,740 --> 00:08:40,610
Alessandro,

380
00:08:40,660 --> 00:08:42,190
I think Alessandro Ricci.

381
00:08:46,170 --> 00:08:46,830
Yeah.

382
00:08:46,830 --> 00:08:47,170
Oh,

383
00:08:47,170 --> 00:08:48,120
Sandra Ricci.

384
00:08:48,390 --> 00:08:49,223
Where's he from?

385
00:08:49,430 --> 00:08:49,981
I don't know.

386
00:08:49,981 --> 00:08:50,814
Good question.

387
00:08:53,170 --> 00:08:53,900
Uh,

388
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:54,880
sounds like Italy.

389
00:08:56,130 --> 00:08:56,551
Yeah,

390
00:08:56,551 --> 00:08:58,350
like his heritage for sure.

391
00:08:59,160 --> 00:08:59,851
I love those.

392
00:08:59,851 --> 00:09:00,870
A weirdo tie.

393
00:09:00,871 --> 00:09:04,470
Tattoos like he's got on
his back or they tap 'em in,

394
00:09:04,530 --> 00:09:05,363
you know,

395
00:09:05,970 --> 00:09:06,600
Oh,

396
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:08,100
good left hook over the top.

397
00:09:08,490 --> 00:09:09,750
A lot of Thai guys have in there,

398
00:09:09,751 --> 00:09:12,300
but you better be legit if
you get one of them tattoos.

399
00:09:12,301 --> 00:09:13,710
You can't be a fucking poser with them.

400
00:09:13,711 --> 00:09:14,690
Hold homemade.

401
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:15,230
Ready?

402
00:09:15,230 --> 00:09:16,063
Yeah.

403
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:16,993
Bangkok ready?

404
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:20,040
Did you see John John
Wayne Park made a t shirt.

405
00:09:20,070 --> 00:09:20,903
Bangkok radio.

406
00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:25,290
He's an amazing human.

407
00:09:25,950 --> 00:09:26,783
He's awesome.

408
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:27,511
God,

409
00:09:27,511 --> 00:09:28,060
I was watching this,

410
00:09:28,060 --> 00:09:29,250
his daughter the the day online.

411
00:09:29,251 --> 00:09:30,180
She's so fucking good.

412
00:09:30,181 --> 00:09:31,014
She's bad ass.

413
00:09:31,430 --> 00:09:33,110
Well Magic of your dad's John Wayne Bar.

414
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:33,510
Yeah.

415
00:09:33,510 --> 00:09:34,530
Better learn how to strike.

416
00:09:36,070 --> 00:09:36,990
Shit's going to come up.

417
00:09:37,010 --> 00:09:37,650
Yes,

418
00:09:37,650 --> 00:09:38,700
it's going to have to come up.

419
00:09:39,150 --> 00:09:39,983
You know,

420
00:09:40,470 --> 00:09:44,160
this is a Felder like
to start off the card.

421
00:09:44,430 --> 00:09:47,040
It's interesting because like this is not
a fight that a lot of people have been

422
00:09:47,041 --> 00:09:47,581
talking about,

423
00:09:47,581 --> 00:09:48,414
but this guy,

424
00:09:48,630 --> 00:09:48,871
you know,

425
00:09:48,871 --> 00:09:53,871
Felder just like a year ago was like
the guy to watch at one 55 and then,

426
00:09:56,101 --> 00:09:56,341
you know,

427
00:09:56,341 --> 00:09:59,850
had a few losses lost of Barboza
and a great fight and he,

428
00:09:59,851 --> 00:10:02,610
he is technically great just
watching good head movement,

429
00:10:02,611 --> 00:10:04,050
punching off his ankles and everything.

430
00:10:04,380 --> 00:10:04,561
Yeah,

431
00:10:04,561 --> 00:10:05,560
I mean his losses,

432
00:10:05,580 --> 00:10:08,040
it just been a ban against
super elite fighters.

433
00:10:08,041 --> 00:10:08,251
I mean,

434
00:10:08,251 --> 00:10:10,740
he's just fighting really
good guys and that's just,

435
00:10:10,930 --> 00:10:12,330
nobody knows better than you.

436
00:10:12,331 --> 00:10:13,081
That's just how it goes.

437
00:10:13,081 --> 00:10:13,914
It happens.

438
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:15,331
Oh,

439
00:10:15,331 --> 00:10:15,571
nice.

440
00:10:15,571 --> 00:10:15,841
Straight.

441
00:10:15,841 --> 00:10:16,560
Right.

442
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:17,393
Beautiful.

443
00:10:18,330 --> 00:10:20,020
So what happens now with your,

444
00:10:20,021 --> 00:10:21,360
your medical treatment?

445
00:10:21,361 --> 00:10:21,930
Did they,

446
00:10:21,930 --> 00:10:22,670
I mean,

447
00:10:22,670 --> 00:10:27,090
is there a way that it can do some sort
of a comprehensive scan and find out

448
00:10:27,091 --> 00:10:28,170
what's going on with your body?

449
00:10:28,230 --> 00:10:28,651
Yeah,

450
00:10:28,651 --> 00:10:29,484
that there,

451
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:30,320
you know,

452
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:31,350
we're doing a lot of testing.

453
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:33,240
We were trying to figure
out they've done like blood,

454
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:34,133
hair,

455
00:10:34,290 --> 00:10:34,951
whatever else,

456
00:10:34,951 --> 00:10:35,191
you know,

457
00:10:35,191 --> 00:10:36,180
and that check your hair.

458
00:10:36,450 --> 00:10:36,870
Yeah.

459
00:10:36,870 --> 00:10:37,860
That's check your hair.

460
00:10:37,861 --> 00:10:38,431
I don't fucking know.

461
00:10:38,431 --> 00:10:39,264
I don't ask questions.

462
00:10:39,350 --> 00:10:39,871
Imagine that.

463
00:10:39,871 --> 00:10:43,060
If they like the hair tells
you everything we check,

464
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:47,400
is there an area above and
beyond like to check everything,

465
00:10:47,620 --> 00:10:48,690
doing eastern medicine,

466
00:10:48,691 --> 00:10:49,620
like all kinds of shit.

467
00:10:49,650 --> 00:10:52,110
So hopefully within the
next couple of weeks I'll,

468
00:10:52,111 --> 00:10:53,370
I'll at least understand,

469
00:10:53,390 --> 00:10:54,000
um,

470
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:54,833
what's wrong.

471
00:10:55,050 --> 00:10:55,650
Yeah.

472
00:10:55,650 --> 00:10:57,630
Partially what's wrong and we can fix it.

473
00:10:57,631 --> 00:10:57,990
Cause I'm,

474
00:10:57,990 --> 00:10:59,010
I'm in amazing shape.

475
00:10:59,250 --> 00:10:59,461
You know,

476
00:10:59,461 --> 00:10:59,651
I've,

477
00:10:59,651 --> 00:11:03,000
I've just had a really string of bad luck.

478
00:11:03,030 --> 00:11:03,841
Whatever it is though.

479
00:11:03,841 --> 00:11:05,130
It sounds pretty significant.

480
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:06,101
I mean if you,

481
00:11:06,101 --> 00:11:08,040
if every time you're
getting down to weight,

482
00:11:08,041 --> 00:11:09,540
your body starts falling apart,

483
00:11:09,750 --> 00:11:10,590
that seems Oh,

484
00:11:10,591 --> 00:11:11,690
beautiful spin there.

485
00:11:12,570 --> 00:11:17,250
It'd lucky turned it from a spinning
back fist to spinning elbow in the middle

486
00:11:17,251 --> 00:11:19,050
of that Oh right hand.

487
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:20,401
But yeah,

488
00:11:20,401 --> 00:11:21,450
you got a good point.

489
00:11:21,451 --> 00:11:25,590
I should probably get this under control
before I cut weight and I don't come

490
00:11:25,591 --> 00:11:25,840
back.

491
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:29,640
You think as a professional fighter that
there is a way to get people to stop

492
00:11:29,641 --> 00:11:30,151
cutting weight.

493
00:11:30,151 --> 00:11:30,971
Do you think there's a way,

494
00:11:30,971 --> 00:11:34,260
if the UFC made a concerted effort the
same way they've made an effort to cut

495
00:11:34,261 --> 00:11:35,011
out all the,

496
00:11:35,011 --> 00:11:35,580
uh,

497
00:11:35,580 --> 00:11:40,230
performance enhancing drugs by having
Novitsky and Usada run the program and

498
00:11:40,231 --> 00:11:43,710
make sure that they're doing all these
random tests on people and brutal,

499
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:45,113
brutal sanctions.

500
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:46,351
That's enough though,

501
00:11:46,351 --> 00:11:48,410
because people would still
cut weight and try to,

502
00:11:48,420 --> 00:11:49,530
I'm not going to get crazy.

503
00:11:49,531 --> 00:11:50,670
People get crazy if they got,

504
00:11:50,671 --> 00:11:51,840
you got a data recover,

505
00:11:51,870 --> 00:11:53,750
you're going to go full blown nuts,

506
00:11:53,751 --> 00:11:54,250
soy,

507
00:11:54,250 --> 00:11:56,050
so that if you got to fight the same day,

508
00:11:56,530 --> 00:11:58,780
you don't go that crazy and you
might be right because you'll lose.

509
00:11:58,870 --> 00:12:00,160
There's no way you're
going to make it through.

510
00:12:00,161 --> 00:12:00,330
Like,

511
00:12:00,330 --> 00:12:00,640
that's what,

512
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:04,210
that's what we do in an Ebi 35 at,

513
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:04,691
at a,

514
00:12:04,691 --> 00:12:06,970
at [inaudible] up any
lower than that in a way.

515
00:12:07,150 --> 00:12:08,570
Do you think though that a,

516
00:12:08,590 --> 00:12:09,430
you would worry,

517
00:12:09,490 --> 00:12:11,170
I mean that was the reason why they had,

518
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:12,033
um,

519
00:12:12,070 --> 00:12:16,450
for day before Wayne's in boxing was
I think it was the duck who Kim fight.

520
00:12:16,750 --> 00:12:20,680
I think they changed the wins and I
think they also changed the number of

521
00:12:20,681 --> 00:12:21,514
rounds.

522
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:23,260
I think it was 12 yeah,

523
00:12:23,261 --> 00:12:24,880
I think that was the fight that did that.

524
00:12:25,060 --> 00:12:27,160
But they used to weigh
in the day of the fight.

525
00:12:27,190 --> 00:12:27,640
Yeah.

526
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:28,150
And you know,

527
00:12:28,150 --> 00:12:29,770
guys used to mean that was,

528
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:31,120
that was the standard.

529
00:12:31,780 --> 00:12:32,680
It was the way they did it.

530
00:12:32,710 --> 00:12:33,071
You know.

531
00:12:33,071 --> 00:12:38,071
And I think if you go back to like
those old school Tommy Hearns sugar ray

532
00:12:38,771 --> 00:12:39,550
Leonard fight with us,

533
00:12:39,550 --> 00:12:39,881
there wasn't,

534
00:12:39,881 --> 00:12:42,430
there wasn't no 15 rounds in those fights.

535
00:12:42,910 --> 00:12:43,743
Oh I'm sure.

536
00:12:43,750 --> 00:12:44,351
I think so.

537
00:12:44,351 --> 00:12:44,970
Right.

538
00:12:44,970 --> 00:12:49,970
Kim Can fight was when the seventies
eighties he was the eighties six I was in

539
00:12:50,291 --> 00:12:53,010
high school cause I remember
I was a big rain man,

540
00:12:53,011 --> 00:12:57,380
senior fan and when that guy died
it was just like a Dharma loud.

541
00:12:59,860 --> 00:13:02,770
Oh Felder got them until over.

542
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:04,141
I want he,

543
00:13:04,141 --> 00:13:04,301
yeah,

544
00:13:04,301 --> 00:13:05,230
he caught him with something before

545
00:13:06,830 --> 00:13:10,120
you know Ibj Jeff Does Matt side,

546
00:13:10,121 --> 00:13:10,540
wham.

547
00:13:10,540 --> 00:13:12,340
Like you weigh in and then you compete.

548
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:13,271
I liked that too,

549
00:13:13,271 --> 00:13:14,104
but,

550
00:13:14,530 --> 00:13:15,880
but guys in fights,

551
00:13:15,910 --> 00:13:20,020
it's a different feeling to go into a
fight and there's so much psychological

552
00:13:20,050 --> 00:13:21,940
shit going on that there's certain,

553
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,350
oh he's limping to this crazy.

554
00:13:23,380 --> 00:13:25,290
You're not going to go
crazy with the weight cut.

555
00:13:25,330 --> 00:13:27,130
You're not going to do
all that extreme stuff.

556
00:13:27,131 --> 00:13:27,731
You can't.

557
00:13:27,731 --> 00:13:28,640
But that's not what I'm saying.

558
00:13:29,150 --> 00:13:32,470
What I'm saying is some guys just wouldn't
make the weight if they had a Duke

559
00:13:32,471 --> 00:13:34,410
cage side and then what
the fuck do you do?

560
00:13:34,660 --> 00:13:35,493
Backups,

561
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:36,730
make it part of the sport.

562
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:37,593
There's some,

563
00:13:38,050 --> 00:13:38,950
there are some guys,

564
00:13:38,951 --> 00:13:40,420
we all know that this happens.

565
00:13:40,450 --> 00:13:42,670
Some guys that just get
real close and I'm good man.

566
00:13:42,940 --> 00:13:43,990
They get real close.

567
00:13:43,990 --> 00:13:45,430
And then the day of the fight,

568
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:47,080
they just don't fucking make weight.

569
00:13:47,140 --> 00:13:48,300
That's when they do big events.

570
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:48,971
But if you,

571
00:13:48,971 --> 00:13:50,460
if you're forced to not be,

572
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:53,460
there's no way you can make a big
cut of it's same day or Matt side.

573
00:13:53,461 --> 00:13:53,740
Right.

574
00:13:53,740 --> 00:13:56,320
You can't do that crazy gnarly shit.

575
00:13:56,430 --> 00:13:57,263
It's trying to do it.

576
00:13:57,710 --> 00:13:58,690
You could cut a little bit,

577
00:13:58,691 --> 00:14:00,550
but it's not going to be 15 pounds.

578
00:14:00,570 --> 00:14:02,220
Don't you think that's
when it gets dangerous?

579
00:14:02,221 --> 00:14:04,090
Don't you think also they
need more weight classes.

580
00:14:04,990 --> 00:14:06,130
I liked the way classes.

581
00:14:06,490 --> 00:14:07,180
Did they bake it?

582
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:07,810
I like more,

583
00:14:07,810 --> 00:14:08,643
but I think it would be,

584
00:14:08,770 --> 00:14:12,640
don't you think there's a giant gap
between 85 and two oh five and that giant

585
00:14:12,641 --> 00:14:14,350
gap between two oh five and heavyweight.

586
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:16,600
Cause there's a bunch of people
that just don't have a home.

587
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:19,150
I have no problem with the weight,

588
00:14:19,450 --> 00:14:21,010
with the weight divisions.

589
00:14:21,250 --> 00:14:22,180
Zero problems with that.

590
00:14:22,181 --> 00:14:23,014
I like it.

591
00:14:23,020 --> 00:14:23,401
Well it's,

592
00:14:23,401 --> 00:14:24,520
it's certainly debatable.

593
00:14:24,580 --> 00:14:26,260
I think they could do 10 pounds.

594
00:14:26,261 --> 00:14:26,950
Yes.

595
00:14:26,950 --> 00:14:28,120
I feel like every 10 pounds.

596
00:14:28,370 --> 00:14:29,260
55 right?

597
00:14:29,270 --> 00:14:29,760
Yeah.

598
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:30,760
But I see it.

599
00:14:30,761 --> 00:14:31,594
But yeah,

600
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:36,840
55 657585905205 to 15 I like
dentistry of the way it is now.

601
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:41,020
You'd have to rewrite it.

602
00:14:41,021 --> 00:14:42,070
You'd have to change.

603
00:14:42,340 --> 00:14:42,940
They'd be like,

604
00:14:42,940 --> 00:14:43,391
what they did,

605
00:14:43,391 --> 00:14:43,721
you know,

606
00:14:43,721 --> 00:14:45,500
they used to be 200 used
to be light heavyweight,

607
00:14:45,550 --> 00:14:48,880
and then they turned to change the
two oh five when Tito Tito Ortiz first

608
00:14:48,881 --> 00:14:51,170
started competing and he was 200 yeah,

609
00:14:51,171 --> 00:14:51,921
they've changed it.

610
00:14:51,921 --> 00:14:52,670
Yeah,

611
00:14:52,670 --> 00:14:53,503
they could do that.

612
00:14:53,570 --> 00:14:54,650
They own the fucking,

613
00:14:54,651 --> 00:14:55,300
first of all,

614
00:14:55,300 --> 00:14:56,200
lay Aleke weight.

615
00:14:56,310 --> 00:14:58,810
Light heavyweight is never
been two oh five and boxing.

616
00:14:58,811 --> 00:15:02,400
It was always one 75 they turned light
heavyweight into two oh five which is

617
00:15:02,401 --> 00:15:03,360
bizarre as it is.

618
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:06,780
Like welterweight welterweight
was one 47 when we were kids.

619
00:15:07,050 --> 00:15:09,000
Sugar Ray Leonard One 47 right.

620
00:15:09,300 --> 00:15:12,240
And then all of a sudden welterweight
was one 70 like that's bizarre.

621
00:15:12,241 --> 00:15:13,051
Like in boxing,

622
00:15:13,051 --> 00:15:14,400
that's a Weirdo weight class.

623
00:15:14,610 --> 00:15:19,610
That was when Roy Jones Jr was one 68 he
was super middle away and it was like,

624
00:15:20,401 --> 00:15:22,050
what kind of bullshit division is that?

625
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:25,110
Like there's middleweight and there's
light heavyweight kind of nonsense is

626
00:15:25,111 --> 00:15:25,560
this.

627
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:28,240
And everybody thought the idea of
going from middle to light heavyweight,

628
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:28,891
it's crazy,

629
00:15:28,891 --> 00:15:31,110
but that's only 15 pounds in the UFC.

630
00:15:31,111 --> 00:15:32,310
That's a normal jump.

631
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:33,593
You know,

632
00:15:34,340 --> 00:15:35,190
it was way too big.

633
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:36,210
I'm telling you man,

634
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:37,860
Rogan fighting championship.

635
00:15:39,190 --> 00:15:40,570
He wants to organize the,

636
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:42,160
my idea of doing it in a basket,

637
00:15:42,580 --> 00:15:44,920
the and the man of basketball court.

638
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:46,210
So way to go.

639
00:15:46,210 --> 00:15:46,690
Yeah.

640
00:15:46,690 --> 00:15:47,740
In rash guards.

641
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:48,613
Yup.

642
00:15:48,940 --> 00:15:51,040
If you want to know your force it,

643
00:15:51,530 --> 00:15:56,530
you have to where you have to wear
rushcards and tights because sports

644
00:15:56,560 --> 00:16:00,880
organizations at every year they meet
and they discuss how they can make their

645
00:16:00,881 --> 00:16:02,440
sport more offensive.

646
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:04,060
Basketball does it.

647
00:16:04,061 --> 00:16:04,420
That's true.

648
00:16:04,420 --> 00:16:05,031
Baseball dot.

649
00:16:05,031 --> 00:16:08,080
It's all about how can we make it more
offensive and they really need to look

650
00:16:08,081 --> 00:16:09,400
into the greasing problem.

651
00:16:09,470 --> 00:16:11,210
In MMA there's a,

652
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:15,280
greasing is definitely an issue
because it's officially illegal.

653
00:16:15,580 --> 00:16:17,890
It's officially illegal to Greece.

654
00:16:17,950 --> 00:16:19,420
Explain how people get
away with it though,

655
00:16:19,421 --> 00:16:20,440
because a lot of people don't know.

656
00:16:20,830 --> 00:16:21,590
Well.

657
00:16:21,590 --> 00:16:22,423
Um,

658
00:16:22,450 --> 00:16:23,710
in MMA,

659
00:16:23,770 --> 00:16:24,603
you know,

660
00:16:26,530 --> 00:16:30,490
a lot of times the matchups will be a
striker against a guy who has way better

661
00:16:30,510 --> 00:16:31,343
Jujitsu.

662
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:31,780
Uh,

663
00:16:31,780 --> 00:16:32,351
it's really,

664
00:16:32,351 --> 00:16:33,670
it's old school.

665
00:16:33,700 --> 00:16:37,060
It's an old school MMA tactic that a,

666
00:16:37,061 --> 00:16:37,660
you know,

667
00:16:37,660 --> 00:16:40,930
if you're a Moyie Thai guy and you're
going against a Jujitsu guy in an MMA

668
00:16:40,931 --> 00:16:41,440
fight,

669
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:42,273
grease up,

670
00:16:42,310 --> 00:16:44,210
and some people do it by,

671
00:16:44,211 --> 00:16:44,950
um,

672
00:16:44,950 --> 00:16:46,150
getting in a bathtub.

673
00:16:46,420 --> 00:16:47,440
I've never seen anybody do it,

674
00:16:47,441 --> 00:16:52,150
but everyone talks about it as getting
in a bath tub of baby oil the night

675
00:16:52,150 --> 00:16:52,450
before.

676
00:16:52,450 --> 00:16:52,960
And then the,

677
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:57,580
and then it soaks into your pores so
deep that you could take like a light

678
00:16:57,581 --> 00:16:58,510
shower and you're,

679
00:16:58,511 --> 00:16:59,320
you know,

680
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:00,910
if you sweat in the fight,

681
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:03,460
the oil's going to come out again and
then you're gonna be really great.

682
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:03,771
Yeah.

683
00:17:03,771 --> 00:17:05,270
You just get more slippery.

684
00:17:05,300 --> 00:17:06,800
And the difference being is your,

685
00:17:06,830 --> 00:17:11,000
it's not like anything that they could
put like something on your skin and find

686
00:17:11,001 --> 00:17:11,810
out that you,

687
00:17:11,810 --> 00:17:12,020
yeah.

688
00:17:12,020 --> 00:17:13,460
The only way that you can do that flicker,

689
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:14,301
it's illegal,

690
00:17:14,301 --> 00:17:15,950
but there's no test for it.

691
00:17:15,951 --> 00:17:17,570
So there's a problem there.

692
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:18,560
It is a problem.

693
00:17:18,840 --> 00:17:20,700
And what it does is if you,

694
00:17:20,701 --> 00:17:22,640
you want the sport to be more offensive,

695
00:17:22,850 --> 00:17:25,700
the more grease the less
offensive on the ground.

696
00:17:25,701 --> 00:17:26,920
That's why people want standups.

697
00:17:26,921 --> 00:17:29,570
Cause in the third round
it's just a grease fest.

698
00:17:29,571 --> 00:17:29,930
They,

699
00:17:29,930 --> 00:17:33,380
they put Vaseline all over their
faces that gets all over the body.

700
00:17:33,381 --> 00:17:34,880
They're super greasy,

701
00:17:34,910 --> 00:17:35,990
hard to submit.

702
00:17:35,991 --> 00:17:37,160
When it's super greasy,

703
00:17:37,370 --> 00:17:38,240
it's illegal.

704
00:17:38,241 --> 00:17:39,650
The grease but no one's checking,

705
00:17:39,651 --> 00:17:40,484
there's no test.

706
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:44,150
It would be better and easier instead
of developing some kind of tests like

707
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:48,560
after the fight they get a swab and then
they go down the fighters backs and if

708
00:17:48,561 --> 00:17:50,490
it has 85% oil or whatever,

709
00:17:50,491 --> 00:17:51,324
then they're busted.

710
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:53,040
They could do something
elaborate like that,

711
00:17:53,041 --> 00:17:53,640
I don't know.

712
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:56,310
But it's easier to just
have them wear rash guards.

713
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:57,690
The Reebok rash guards,

714
00:17:57,720 --> 00:18:00,270
Reebok tights that solves your problem.

715
00:18:00,271 --> 00:18:04,710
You can grease if you got a
girls were rash guard sort of.

716
00:18:04,740 --> 00:18:08,060
They don't want anything to covers
their arms but I they shouldn't.

717
00:18:08,100 --> 00:18:08,933
They should.

718
00:18:09,180 --> 00:18:10,920
It's backwards thinking,

719
00:18:11,300 --> 00:18:11,550
you know,

720
00:18:11,550 --> 00:18:14,160
you want to promote or
offense on the ground.

721
00:18:14,250 --> 00:18:15,480
If the let the,

722
00:18:15,570 --> 00:18:18,600
if we eliminate all the grease and
have everyone aligned rash guards,

723
00:18:18,870 --> 00:18:20,430
people aren't slipping out of stuff.

724
00:18:20,490 --> 00:18:22,740
Less defense more often.

725
00:18:22,890 --> 00:18:23,371
That's what,

726
00:18:23,371 --> 00:18:24,120
that's what happens.

727
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:25,230
The more grease,

728
00:18:25,380 --> 00:18:26,520
the more defense,

729
00:18:26,580 --> 00:18:30,540
the less authentic you want to see a
grease a slop fest on the ground or do you

730
00:18:30,541 --> 00:18:32,280
want to see awesome submissions?

731
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:34,950
I'd rather see submissions
from a business standpoint.

732
00:18:34,980 --> 00:18:36,900
If we were able to do
more sponsorship stuff,

733
00:18:36,901 --> 00:18:38,340
yes we look like fucking NASCAR's.

734
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:38,770
Yeah.

735
00:18:38,770 --> 00:18:40,410
But Reebok into it.

736
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:42,180
If we can make money off it,

737
00:18:42,181 --> 00:18:43,650
but I don't know.

738
00:18:43,670 --> 00:18:44,010
I don't,

739
00:18:44,010 --> 00:18:45,090
I don't like fight with clothes on.

740
00:18:45,750 --> 00:18:46,021
Yeah,

741
00:18:46,021 --> 00:18:47,680
I see what you're saying
and don't purchase.

742
00:18:47,940 --> 00:18:48,773
I get what you're saying.

743
00:18:49,170 --> 00:18:50,010
Point of view too.

744
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:53,730
I think maybe making it an option wouldn't
be the worst idea because if you do

745
00:18:53,731 --> 00:18:55,710
have a rash guard and your opponent does,

746
00:18:55,711 --> 00:18:56,790
it doesn't have one,

747
00:18:56,791 --> 00:18:58,030
you definitely would be able to control

748
00:18:58,190 --> 00:18:58,580
better.

749
00:18:58,580 --> 00:18:58,760
Yeah.

750
00:18:58,760 --> 00:18:59,840
You still have a barrier.

751
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:00,390
It's still,

752
00:19:00,390 --> 00:19:01,280
there's still that barrier.

753
00:19:01,460 --> 00:19:02,750
You want less,

754
00:19:02,830 --> 00:19:03,110
uh,

755
00:19:03,110 --> 00:19:06,080
less of a Turkish oil
wrestling match on the ground.

756
00:19:06,180 --> 00:19:08,150
You want to go away from that.

757
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:08,980
Right

758
00:19:08,980 --> 00:19:09,813
is a good point.

759
00:19:10,150 --> 00:19:14,470
And I think that the idea
of seeing more submissions,

760
00:19:14,471 --> 00:19:19,390
also being able to control people on the
ground more would probably lessen the,

761
00:19:19,391 --> 00:19:19,661
uh,

762
00:19:19,661 --> 00:19:21,060
amount of,

763
00:19:21,080 --> 00:19:21,310
uh,

764
00:19:21,310 --> 00:19:24,250
standups that you would have to have
because guys would get things done better.

765
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:27,640
It would sound solve the
greasing issue just like that.

766
00:19:27,730 --> 00:19:29,110
You make Reebok rash guards,

767
00:19:29,111 --> 00:19:29,980
Reebok tights,

768
00:19:30,190 --> 00:19:31,180
no grease problem.

769
00:19:31,230 --> 00:19:31,520
It's,

770
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:32,740
it's definitely a problem with,

771
00:19:32,741 --> 00:19:33,574
it's illegal.

772
00:19:33,700 --> 00:19:35,890
There's a problem and no
one's doing anything about it.

773
00:19:36,070 --> 00:19:38,200
And if you think guys are
guys that fight Jujitsu,

774
00:19:38,201 --> 00:19:40,190
black belts are in
Greece and well then you,

775
00:19:40,191 --> 00:19:41,130
you'll probably be crazy.

776
00:19:41,220 --> 00:19:42,130
Watch CNN.

777
00:19:42,580 --> 00:19:43,240
Oh,

778
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:45,670
don't go there and talk to it.

779
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:47,590
Yeah,

780
00:19:47,590 --> 00:19:48,423
it's um,

781
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:49,480
it's not,

782
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:50,380
we're not done.

783
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:54,970
I don't think this board has done as far
as figuring out all the best ways to go

784
00:19:54,971 --> 00:19:55,450
about it.

785
00:19:55,450 --> 00:19:55,630
No,

786
00:19:55,630 --> 00:19:57,640
I don't think ever.

787
00:19:57,940 --> 00:19:59,050
We're always going to be evolving.

788
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:02,830
What do you think about
longer rounds or short around?

789
00:20:03,040 --> 00:20:06,460
Do you think that the five minute round
is the right length or do you think like

790
00:20:06,461 --> 00:20:06,640
some,

791
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:09,280
I've heard people argue they should
have three minute rounds because people

792
00:20:09,281 --> 00:20:09,950
could fight,

793
00:20:09,950 --> 00:20:12,430
fall out faster and
harder for three minutes,

794
00:20:12,580 --> 00:20:15,670
then they can for five and then I've
heard the other arguments for 10 minute

795
00:20:15,671 --> 00:20:18,220
rounds because you get to go out of
the ground like the old pride days.

796
00:20:18,221 --> 00:20:21,070
You have that first round and you
have plenty of time to get something

797
00:20:21,071 --> 00:20:21,904
happening.

798
00:20:22,890 --> 00:20:23,470
I would,

799
00:20:23,470 --> 00:20:26,670
I would like the longer
rounds fucking drown.

800
00:20:26,710 --> 00:20:29,010
Somebody's taking in a
deep water and that that's,

801
00:20:29,060 --> 00:20:29,560
that's,

802
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:30,261
that's separate.

803
00:20:30,261 --> 00:20:30,400
Yeah.

804
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:31,060
Yeah.

805
00:20:31,060 --> 00:20:31,460
It's a big deal.

806
00:20:31,460 --> 00:20:32,031
It also,

807
00:20:32,031 --> 00:20:34,220
it allows more tactics.

808
00:20:34,290 --> 00:20:34,500
Yes.

809
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:37,190
It allows you to figure out
how to pace yourself more.

810
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:38,690
It allows you to figure out,

811
00:20:38,691 --> 00:20:41,270
like to be very smart about
when you put it on them,

812
00:20:41,570 --> 00:20:41,841
you know,

813
00:20:41,841 --> 00:20:44,870
and and be able to feel a person's timing
out and feel whether or not they're

814
00:20:44,871 --> 00:20:45,690
fading.

815
00:20:45,690 --> 00:20:45,931
Guy,

816
00:20:45,931 --> 00:20:47,090
I agree with you guys on that.

817
00:20:47,140 --> 00:20:47,980
Think 10 minutes is

818
00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:48,813
the right way to go.

819
00:20:49,830 --> 00:20:50,663
It's a bit sad.

820
00:20:50,830 --> 00:20:52,740
Being an opportunist.

821
00:20:52,860 --> 00:20:53,740
I would,

822
00:20:54,190 --> 00:20:55,750
I can see the benefits of fighting with,

823
00:20:55,751 --> 00:20:55,931
with,

824
00:20:55,931 --> 00:20:57,790
with a rash guard on if you're
going to choke somebody out,

825
00:20:57,791 --> 00:20:58,410
whether we haven't have,

826
00:20:58,410 --> 00:20:59,530
have better or grappling or,

827
00:20:59,531 --> 00:21:00,160
you know,

828
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:00,993
positional stuff.

829
00:21:01,030 --> 00:21:01,211
Yeah,

830
00:21:01,211 --> 00:21:01,601
for sure.

831
00:21:01,601 --> 00:21:03,910
It'd be better rapport and
there's no problems with it.

832
00:21:03,911 --> 00:21:04,670
Like if you were,

833
00:21:04,670 --> 00:21:05,370
yeah,

834
00:21:05,370 --> 00:21:08,920
like crazy rules are still exist.

835
00:21:09,220 --> 00:21:11,230
Like you can wear tights,

836
00:21:12,130 --> 00:21:14,500
compression shorts to your knees,

837
00:21:14,770 --> 00:21:19,030
but not to the end goal that
hang the calf is dangerous.

838
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:20,313
You know what I mean?

839
00:21:20,540 --> 00:21:20,820
Crazy.

840
00:21:20,820 --> 00:21:23,620
I hope you rack up your
ankles and some places,

841
00:21:24,530 --> 00:21:25,050
George,

842
00:21:25,050 --> 00:21:26,880
that George Schlatter apolis yeah.

843
00:21:26,890 --> 00:21:27,600
Then we made them happen.

844
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:28,211
It just fucking,

845
00:21:28,211 --> 00:21:29,044
he used to have

846
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:33,790
the less grease,

847
00:21:33,940 --> 00:21:38,940
the more often you want more avance
particularly on the ground for it to sound

848
00:21:40,601 --> 00:21:45,400
crazy that you could fight in a rash
guard and it's not going to be a problem.

849
00:21:45,430 --> 00:21:46,420
People aren't going to grab it.

850
00:21:46,421 --> 00:21:49,660
Girls on grabbing each other's
rash guards and sports bras,

851
00:21:49,780 --> 00:21:51,050
they're not being grabbed it.

852
00:21:51,220 --> 00:21:51,940
It's just like,

853
00:21:51,940 --> 00:21:52,181
oh,

854
00:21:52,181 --> 00:21:52,810
they do.

855
00:21:52,810 --> 00:21:54,680
If you were a rash guard
took on a grubbing,

856
00:21:54,750 --> 00:21:54,960
no,

857
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:55,151
no.

858
00:21:55,151 --> 00:21:56,320
Grabbing is illegal.

859
00:21:56,321 --> 00:21:57,880
You don't grab them real simple.

860
00:21:57,910 --> 00:21:59,200
Nobody's grabbing anything.

861
00:21:59,290 --> 00:22:02,950
Rash guard is way better than shorts
cause shorts could grab all the fucking

862
00:22:02,951 --> 00:22:03,190
time.

863
00:22:03,190 --> 00:22:03,550
Yeah,

864
00:22:03,550 --> 00:22:06,010
I think honestly like what do you see
Tyron Woodley wearing right there?

865
00:22:06,011 --> 00:22:06,670
That's the way to go.

866
00:22:06,670 --> 00:22:07,503
Let's do it.

867
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:08,381
Let's do,

868
00:22:08,381 --> 00:22:11,620
it should be the way to
go on a basketball court.

869
00:22:11,830 --> 00:22:13,130
See it's time for that.

870
00:22:14,380 --> 00:22:15,310
I'll put it all together.

871
00:22:15,580 --> 00:22:16,450
I'll put it all together.

872
00:22:16,490 --> 00:22:18,070
Kind of take some of my time is your money

873
00:22:20,260 --> 00:22:21,130
and I'll produce it.

874
00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:23,050
I need less.

875
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:25,510
That's what I need less show up.

876
00:22:25,540 --> 00:22:26,890
You just show up that night.

877
00:22:27,810 --> 00:22:29,810
I can't do Rogan fighting champion.

878
00:22:29,810 --> 00:22:30,850
Just so busy.

879
00:22:31,390 --> 00:22:33,550
I'm so much more busy than I should be.

880
00:22:33,820 --> 00:22:36,610
I should have bought
courts a genius idea to do.

881
00:22:36,690 --> 00:22:38,890
I should be half as
busy as I am right now.

882
00:22:38,940 --> 00:22:39,720
Okay.

883
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:40,180
Maybe.

884
00:22:40,180 --> 00:22:42,430
Maybe it'll happen.

885
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:45,340
Maybe someone else who will
take that idea and run with it.

886
00:22:45,710 --> 00:22:47,350
It's already being done
in Russia and Russia.

887
00:22:47,351 --> 00:22:49,180
They had it on a football
field in the grass.

888
00:22:49,210 --> 00:22:51,580
Those dudes are beating the shit out
of each other at some amateur event.

889
00:22:51,700 --> 00:22:53,170
So the Russian speaking of,

890
00:22:53,250 --> 00:22:53,680
Oh,

891
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:55,720
the Russians thought I got cut.

892
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:57,070
This was not that long ago.

893
00:22:57,570 --> 00:22:58,570
Sent me a nice to offer,

894
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:00,040
which Russians,

895
00:23:01,690 --> 00:23:03,480
I don't know which ones it is
and I know these people know

896
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:08,500
insurrections and it was talking
to my agent and he's like,

897
00:23:08,501 --> 00:23:09,010
yeah.

898
00:23:09,010 --> 00:23:09,251
He's like,

899
00:23:09,251 --> 00:23:10,870
guess how much the average is six figures.

900
00:23:10,930 --> 00:23:11,231
I was like,

901
00:23:11,231 --> 00:23:12,010
wow,

902
00:23:12,010 --> 00:23:12,843
holy shit.

903
00:23:13,210 --> 00:23:14,440
Well then it's a nice,

904
00:23:14,441 --> 00:23:16,240
I'm going to be bargaining
bargaining chip.

905
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:18,540
Hopefully I can use in
the future with EFC.

906
00:23:18,670 --> 00:23:21,220
Fabrizio over dooms trying to
get cut so we can go over there.

907
00:23:21,310 --> 00:23:21,670
They're,

908
00:23:21,670 --> 00:23:21,851
they,

909
00:23:21,851 --> 00:23:23,710
they're paying fucking big money.

910
00:23:23,740 --> 00:23:23,990
Well,

911
00:23:23,990 --> 00:23:26,710
probation for dooms always hanging
in with that Chechnyan leader dude,

912
00:23:27,410 --> 00:23:27,810
who's,

913
00:23:27,810 --> 00:23:28,870
that scares the shit out of me.

914
00:23:29,050 --> 00:23:32,350
That's like one of those things where
you get over there and you just like,

915
00:23:32,530 --> 00:23:35,410
you just get over there and hang out
just in time to get out of there before

916
00:23:35,470 --> 00:23:37,150
some crazy rebellion breaks out.

917
00:23:37,570 --> 00:23:39,130
They start bombing from the sky.

918
00:23:40,390 --> 00:23:40,631
Yeah.

919
00:23:40,631 --> 00:23:41,650
I mean that,

920
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:42,850
I just,

921
00:23:42,850 --> 00:23:43,330
man,

922
00:23:43,330 --> 00:23:44,163
it was,

923
00:23:44,210 --> 00:23:45,043
I was like,

924
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:45,770
okay.

925
00:23:45,770 --> 00:23:46,220
Like maybe

926
00:23:46,220 --> 00:23:47,053
it'd be,

927
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:50,000
is that Russia?

928
00:23:50,120 --> 00:23:51,620
It's all a part of the,

929
00:23:51,621 --> 00:23:51,980
uh,

930
00:23:51,980 --> 00:23:52,860
old Russia.

931
00:23:53,560 --> 00:23:53,850
Well,

932
00:23:53,850 --> 00:23:54,160
it's,

933
00:23:54,160 --> 00:23:54,640
it's,

934
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:55,010
I don't know.

935
00:23:55,010 --> 00:23:56,280
They get along with Russia.

936
00:23:56,340 --> 00:23:56,740
Yeah,

937
00:23:56,740 --> 00:23:57,110
yeah,

938
00:23:57,110 --> 00:23:59,900
they'd love MMA and Jujitsu
people get mad at us,

939
00:23:59,901 --> 00:24:01,490
but we don't know Jack Shit about Russia.

940
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:02,541
People get so pissed.

941
00:24:02,541 --> 00:24:03,950
We'd started talking about the Ukraine.

942
00:24:04,340 --> 00:24:04,791
I didn't know that.

943
00:24:04,791 --> 00:24:08,510
The Ukraine speaks a different
language and they were like family.

944
00:24:09,820 --> 00:24:11,740
They were all part of
the whole big landmass.

945
00:24:11,780 --> 00:24:12,710
I loved them all.

946
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:15,620
It's amazing how many tough
motherfuckers come out of,

947
00:24:15,621 --> 00:24:19,460
they are the world's Sam's is Christ
such bad asses over there from the top to

948
00:24:19,461 --> 00:24:20,000
the bottom.

949
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:20,241
What?

950
00:24:20,241 --> 00:24:22,130
James James is going
to give us a map here.

951
00:24:23,060 --> 00:24:23,900
The Russian republic.

952
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:24,460
It is,

953
00:24:24,460 --> 00:24:24,550
oh,

954
00:24:24,550 --> 00:24:25,310
there you go.

955
00:24:25,310 --> 00:24:25,761
So,

956
00:24:25,761 --> 00:24:26,150
uh,

957
00:24:26,150 --> 00:24:26,931
that guy,

958
00:24:26,931 --> 00:24:28,130
he loves MMA,

959
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:32,150
that Chechen leader and he's always
got like MMA fighters from the UFC over

960
00:24:32,151 --> 00:24:32,690
there.

961
00:24:32,690 --> 00:24:33,021
What is he?

962
00:24:33,021 --> 00:24:34,400
The president,

963
00:24:35,220 --> 00:24:36,470
but I don't know what kind of leader.

964
00:24:36,471 --> 00:24:37,470
Just paying them money.

965
00:24:37,700 --> 00:24:38,521
I don't know.

966
00:24:38,521 --> 00:24:42,350
Like what the name is to find out
what the Chechnyan Lieber leader is.

967
00:24:42,620 --> 00:24:43,453
Is he like,

968
00:24:44,300 --> 00:24:46,400
like what does Putin is
the president of Russia,

969
00:24:46,580 --> 00:24:47,120
right?

970
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:48,020
They call it president.

971
00:24:48,410 --> 00:24:49,820
I think he said some other others.

972
00:24:49,821 --> 00:24:52,430
Not an MRI or minister prime minister.

973
00:24:52,550 --> 00:24:53,120
I don't know.

974
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:53,750
We should know.

975
00:24:53,750 --> 00:24:54,170
Yeah.

976
00:24:54,170 --> 00:24:55,100
But we're American.

977
00:24:55,340 --> 00:24:56,900
There's a computer somewhere in Magens.

978
00:24:56,901 --> 00:24:59,300
Don't know Jack Shit about what's
going on the rest of the world.

979
00:24:59,540 --> 00:25:01,430
We know what's Brexit here about Brexit,

980
00:25:01,450 --> 00:25:02,283
Britain,

981
00:25:02,810 --> 00:25:04,580
but they're doing another wolverine movie.

982
00:25:04,581 --> 00:25:05,660
Thank God Logan.

983
00:25:07,340 --> 00:25:12,340
Apparently they made this one extra
fucked up so it had to be PG 13 like they

984
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:16,820
decided to make it way more violent.

985
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:19,280
It's rated R.

986
00:25:19,280 --> 00:25:19,371
Oh,

987
00:25:19,371 --> 00:25:19,900
that's right.

988
00:25:19,900 --> 00:25:20,250
Radar.

989
00:25:20,250 --> 00:25:23,450
Not PG 13 because they wanted
to do it the right way.

990
00:25:23,450 --> 00:25:24,290
Super violent.

991
00:25:24,291 --> 00:25:29,291
Could tell she'd been Luke in
much three [inaudible] hands.

992
00:25:30,290 --> 00:25:31,880
[inaudible] that's his name.

993
00:25:31,910 --> 00:25:34,850
Is this supposed to be
prequel or sequel question?

994
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:35,631
He looks older there,

995
00:25:35,631 --> 00:25:37,520
so I guess it's like later in his life,

996
00:25:39,380 --> 00:25:40,191
several weeks ago,

997
00:25:40,191 --> 00:25:42,680
a baffling image made the
rounds on social media.

998
00:25:42,681 --> 00:25:44,600
Chechnya is menacing and unsavory.

999
00:25:44,601 --> 00:25:45,434
President.

1000
00:25:45,470 --> 00:25:46,260
There we go.

1001
00:25:46,260 --> 00:25:47,510
He's the rams.

1002
00:25:47,511 --> 00:25:48,800
And how'd he say his name?

1003
00:25:48,801 --> 00:25:49,634
Cadre.

1004
00:25:49,790 --> 00:25:50,623
Cad.

1005
00:25:50,690 --> 00:25:52,280
Cad caddy.

1006
00:25:52,281 --> 00:25:57,281
Rove jubilantly positioning side by
side with UFC heavyweight champion for

1007
00:25:58,701 --> 00:25:59,331
Reesey over doing,

1008
00:25:59,331 --> 00:25:59,421
well,

1009
00:25:59,421 --> 00:26:00,950
he's not heavyweight champion anymore.

1010
00:26:01,100 --> 00:26:02,240
Holding his oversized belt.

1011
00:26:02,241 --> 00:26:03,110
Was is an old picture,

1012
00:26:03,111 --> 00:26:03,944
is that what it is?

1013
00:26:04,250 --> 00:26:05,210
Or this is an old article.

1014
00:26:05,590 --> 00:26:06,590
You have champs.

1015
00:26:06,591 --> 00:26:08,060
Complicated Russian ties.

1016
00:26:08,270 --> 00:26:08,431
Well,

1017
00:26:08,431 --> 00:26:09,880
yours is from brushing

1018
00:26:12,020 --> 00:26:13,100
my boy.

1019
00:26:14,210 --> 00:26:15,080
He's doing some,

1020
00:26:15,081 --> 00:26:16,790
some espionage.

1021
00:26:16,840 --> 00:26:17,180
Yeah.

1022
00:26:17,180 --> 00:26:17,810
Well some,

1023
00:26:17,810 --> 00:26:18,643
some rich famous,

1024
00:26:18,860 --> 00:26:20,390
some rich leader just likes him.

1025
00:26:20,391 --> 00:26:20,810
So yeah,

1026
00:26:20,810 --> 00:26:22,230
I paid him to fucking
go hang out with him.

1027
00:26:22,250 --> 00:26:22,360
What?

1028
00:26:22,360 --> 00:26:24,290
He likes those dudes to come
over and party with them.

1029
00:26:24,350 --> 00:26:24,771
I mean,

1030
00:26:24,771 --> 00:26:28,520
when you're a super powerful
baller in some other country,

1031
00:26:28,550 --> 00:26:29,540
that's like the ultimate,

1032
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:30,740
you get the heavyweight champion,

1033
00:26:30,741 --> 00:26:31,940
the UFC to come hang with you.

1034
00:26:32,030 --> 00:26:32,600
Yeah.

1035
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:32,751
Here,

1036
00:26:32,751 --> 00:26:33,261
put this hat on.

1037
00:26:33,261 --> 00:26:33,950
Take a picture with me.

1038
00:26:33,950 --> 00:26:34,783
Here it is.

1039
00:26:34,850 --> 00:26:35,660
Eddie Bravo,

1040
00:26:35,660 --> 00:26:36,620
Tony Ferguson,

1041
00:26:36,621 --> 00:26:37,300
Habib number,

1042
00:26:37,300 --> 00:26:37,790
Madoff.

1043
00:26:37,790 --> 00:26:39,080
Holy Shit.

1044
00:26:39,081 --> 00:26:39,680
Holy Shit.

1045
00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:41,000
That's just a couple of weeks away.

1046
00:26:41,001 --> 00:26:41,834
That's going to be,

1047
00:26:41,970 --> 00:26:42,950
you're going to be there for that.

1048
00:26:44,150 --> 00:26:44,983
That'd be awesome.

1049
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:46,620
It's going to be fucking nuts,

1050
00:26:46,621 --> 00:26:46,980
man.

1051
00:26:46,980 --> 00:26:47,460
Dude,

1052
00:26:47,460 --> 00:26:48,060
we're doing it.

1053
00:26:48,060 --> 00:26:49,770
You mean Tony is,

1054
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:51,170
that's,

1055
00:26:51,170 --> 00:26:53,250
that's an exciting fight man.

1056
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:53,611
I know.

1057
00:26:53,611 --> 00:26:54,810
We can't talk about strategy.

1058
00:26:54,840 --> 00:26:55,320
Yeah.

1059
00:26:55,320 --> 00:26:56,153
But um,

1060
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:57,180
it's uh,

1061
00:26:57,180 --> 00:27:00,510
it's crazy fight between the number one
and the number two contender in that

1062
00:27:00,511 --> 00:27:01,344
division.

1063
00:27:01,410 --> 00:27:05,700
The obvious strategy for Khabib is to
try to take Tony down and the obvious

1064
00:27:05,701 --> 00:27:09,060
strategy for Tony is
to keep it up and dot.

1065
00:27:09,061 --> 00:27:09,894
I'm up on his feet.

1066
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:13,410
That's the obvious and
everybody knows that.

1067
00:27:13,990 --> 00:27:14,480
Let me think.

1068
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:15,360
How much do you think,

1069
00:27:15,390 --> 00:27:15,840
uh,

1070
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:19,860
like opinion changed when he got clipped
by Michael Johnson and got wobbled?

1071
00:27:20,280 --> 00:27:21,180
People are saying,

1072
00:27:21,210 --> 00:27:22,310
and I mean if you're looking at,

1073
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:23,310
I mean it's pretty obvious.

1074
00:27:23,311 --> 00:27:23,701
Okay.

1075
00:27:23,701 --> 00:27:23,870
He,

1076
00:27:23,870 --> 00:27:24,703
he,

1077
00:27:24,750 --> 00:27:25,230
he,

1078
00:27:25,230 --> 00:27:25,890
he's human.

1079
00:27:25,890 --> 00:27:26,580
Yes.

1080
00:27:26,580 --> 00:27:27,980
That's really what you saw.

1081
00:27:28,900 --> 00:27:29,390
Exactly.

1082
00:27:29,390 --> 00:27:32,730
Cause for 24 or five or
23 fights before that,

1083
00:27:32,731 --> 00:27:33,080
right.

1084
00:27:33,080 --> 00:27:36,600
[inaudible] mall and motherfuckers
basically says that he does,

1085
00:27:36,990 --> 00:27:40,530
he's not one of those guys
that can take anything.

1086
00:27:40,830 --> 00:27:41,011
You know,

1087
00:27:41,011 --> 00:27:42,720
there's guys out there
that can take any shot.

1088
00:27:43,080 --> 00:27:44,340
They haven't been rocked yet.

1089
00:27:44,450 --> 00:27:45,090
Right.

1090
00:27:45,090 --> 00:27:46,320
We're seeing a little,

1091
00:27:46,380 --> 00:27:47,430
maybe a little chink,

1092
00:27:47,431 --> 00:27:48,350
a little tiny Cenk.

1093
00:27:48,810 --> 00:27:50,070
Everybody's looking at that.

1094
00:27:50,310 --> 00:27:50,791
You know what I mean?

1095
00:27:50,791 --> 00:27:52,440
It's going to give people confidence,

1096
00:27:52,441 --> 00:27:55,890
but he's so good at taking
people down and mauling him.

1097
00:27:56,190 --> 00:27:56,461
You know,

1098
00:27:56,461 --> 00:27:59,280
that that is the hardest thing to stop.

1099
00:27:59,820 --> 00:28:00,660
But you know,

1100
00:28:00,661 --> 00:28:05,220
we're doing everything we
can to prepare for the best.

1101
00:28:05,221 --> 00:28:05,910
The worst,

1102
00:28:05,910 --> 00:28:07,020
the worst case scenario.

1103
00:28:07,021 --> 00:28:08,480
The best scenario where we're,

1104
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:09,433
we're doing,

1105
00:28:09,450 --> 00:28:11,340
I mean Tony's doing everything really.

1106
00:28:11,341 --> 00:28:12,174
Tony is a fucking,

1107
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:17,010
he's a maniac is the most fascinating
fight in the division for me outside of

1108
00:28:17,011 --> 00:28:18,320
Conor McGregor versus IB.

1109
00:28:18,930 --> 00:28:19,920
Those two fights.

1110
00:28:20,070 --> 00:28:20,920
Conor McGregor versus,

1111
00:28:20,921 --> 00:28:22,800
that'd be even Tony
Ferguson versus could be.

1112
00:28:23,070 --> 00:28:26,040
Those are the two most exciting
fights and in my opinion,

1113
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:28,050
without giving anything away,

1114
00:28:28,051 --> 00:28:33,051
everybody knows based on the past
that Tony can seriously choke people.

1115
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:36,430
Anybody out like any,

1116
00:28:36,990 --> 00:28:41,990
any wrong move on the ground and he could
hit that Doris from any position and

1117
00:28:42,930 --> 00:28:43,291
he just,

1118
00:28:43,291 --> 00:28:44,124
it just keeps

1119
00:28:45,540 --> 00:28:47,930
growing and expanding and he's,

1120
00:28:48,150 --> 00:28:53,150
he's become so unorthodox on his
feet on the ground is pulling guard,

1121
00:28:54,210 --> 00:28:55,290
flying him a nice,

1122
00:28:55,350 --> 00:28:56,610
he's all over the place.

1123
00:28:56,790 --> 00:28:58,050
He's doing gymnastics,

1124
00:28:58,051 --> 00:28:58,890
he's doing flips.

1125
00:28:59,070 --> 00:29:02,850
He's doing but he's doing
now what he's doing.

1126
00:29:02,940 --> 00:29:04,020
He does ever all thing.

1127
00:29:04,350 --> 00:29:05,220
I don't even really know.

1128
00:29:05,221 --> 00:29:06,330
I tried to do it in big bear.

1129
00:29:06,331 --> 00:29:07,164
I'm like Ah.

1130
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:08,990
He does [inaudible] ball.

1131
00:29:09,030 --> 00:29:09,330
Yes.

1132
00:29:09,330 --> 00:29:14,110
Steel Bowling Ball and he does all this
crazy like almost like dancing does with

1133
00:29:14,111 --> 00:29:14,181
it.

1134
00:29:14,181 --> 00:29:17,970
It looks like he brought a wing
Chung dummy up to big bear.

1135
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:18,910
He's into wing Chung.

1136
00:29:18,911 --> 00:29:20,010
He's into everything.

1137
00:29:20,730 --> 00:29:21,810
Everything man.

1138
00:29:22,290 --> 00:29:23,210
He is a true sign.

1139
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:26,400
That wasn't like a joke
that he's really into it.

1140
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:27,330
He likes,

1141
00:29:27,330 --> 00:29:30,670
he trains like no one
I've ever seen before.

1142
00:29:30,671 --> 00:29:33,690
It just hours and hours just
out in the front up in big bear.

1143
00:29:33,691 --> 00:29:34,530
He built everything,

1144
00:29:34,531 --> 00:29:34,981
the bags,

1145
00:29:34,981 --> 00:29:35,581
the stands,

1146
00:29:35,581 --> 00:29:36,060
everything.

1147
00:29:36,060 --> 00:29:37,050
He builds everything.

1148
00:29:37,051 --> 00:29:37,890
He's got a house out there.

1149
00:29:37,891 --> 00:29:38,910
He's the ultimate macgyver.

1150
00:29:38,911 --> 00:29:39,031
No,

1151
00:29:39,031 --> 00:29:41,100
he rented it and built
it the first two days.

1152
00:29:41,380 --> 00:29:42,213
Brought it all out

1153
00:29:42,550 --> 00:29:42,761
dude.

1154
00:29:42,761 --> 00:29:44,320
He's like the ultimate macgyver,

1155
00:29:44,670 --> 00:29:48,050
a construction carpenter.

1156
00:29:48,830 --> 00:29:51,200
He can build a Sarah
McMahon would take down.

1157
00:29:53,010 --> 00:29:54,820
Damn do when I put my hands on her,

1158
00:29:54,821 --> 00:29:55,031
you know,

1159
00:29:55,031 --> 00:29:56,890
like when I put my hand
by the interviewer,

1160
00:29:57,160 --> 00:29:58,840
her back is like glaze and t bowels.

1161
00:29:58,841 --> 00:29:59,350
Yeah.

1162
00:29:59,350 --> 00:29:59,610
She,

1163
00:29:59,610 --> 00:30:00,443
she gorilla.

1164
00:30:01,420 --> 00:30:02,081
She's stupid.

1165
00:30:02,081 --> 00:30:02,471
Strong,

1166
00:30:02,471 --> 00:30:03,191
strong woman.

1167
00:30:03,191 --> 00:30:03,581
Stupid,

1168
00:30:03,581 --> 00:30:06,050
strong Olympic silver medalist.

1169
00:30:06,060 --> 00:30:06,400
Right?

1170
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:07,210
Yeah.

1171
00:30:07,210 --> 00:30:07,721
See this.

1172
00:30:07,721 --> 00:30:09,160
Here's Tony working with that.

1173
00:30:09,161 --> 00:30:09,994
The weighted ball.

1174
00:30:10,030 --> 00:30:10,450
Yeah.

1175
00:30:10,450 --> 00:30:12,730
It's just so what a
weird way of working out.

1176
00:30:12,760 --> 00:30:14,530
Like he does all these
strange moves with it.

1177
00:30:14,680 --> 00:30:16,780
Like did you ever ask him
like what his philosophy is?

1178
00:30:17,080 --> 00:30:17,913
Philosophy is,

1179
00:30:18,990 --> 00:30:19,823
uh,

1180
00:30:19,870 --> 00:30:24,400
obviously he believes in movement
training cause this is all just like some

1181
00:30:24,401 --> 00:30:28,360
crazy Capoeira Wera but with a steel ball,

1182
00:30:28,780 --> 00:30:30,850
he's doing this all day.

1183
00:30:30,940 --> 00:30:31,773
Yeah,

1184
00:30:31,930 --> 00:30:32,600
he does just,

1185
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:33,910
we always just mixes it.

1186
00:30:33,911 --> 00:30:34,850
Oh yeah.

1187
00:30:34,870 --> 00:30:38,440
He's always doing something for
people trying to sync this up at home.

1188
00:30:38,590 --> 00:30:39,970
It's round one.

1189
00:30:39,971 --> 00:30:41,500
I'm sorry I didn't do
this for the first fight.

1190
00:30:41,650 --> 00:30:42,221
Round one,

1191
00:30:42,221 --> 00:30:45,430
three 53 50 to 351,

1192
00:30:45,431 --> 00:30:47,990
three 50 [inaudible] triangle task.

1193
00:30:48,030 --> 00:30:48,581
That's a wrap.

1194
00:30:48,581 --> 00:30:50,490
Sam Sarah McMahon.

1195
00:30:50,491 --> 00:30:52,360
He just pumped that girl back.

1196
00:30:52,500 --> 00:30:53,500
Gorilla squished her.

1197
00:30:53,530 --> 00:30:53,680
Yeah.

1198
00:30:53,680 --> 00:30:55,210
You know what she's hoping around?

1199
00:30:55,290 --> 00:31:00,290
Maybe she may be the first girl Jesus
that's known for taking people down,

1200
00:31:03,580 --> 00:31:04,400
passing their garden,

1201
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:05,880
choking him out like that there.

1202
00:31:05,890 --> 00:31:06,371
Go to,

1203
00:31:06,371 --> 00:31:08,020
you got to stop that fucking,

1204
00:31:08,820 --> 00:31:09,653
what did she say?

1205
00:31:11,770 --> 00:31:12,880
I don't know what the hell she was saying.

1206
00:31:13,030 --> 00:31:13,880
She's fucking scary.

1207
00:31:14,110 --> 00:31:14,820
Yeah.

1208
00:31:14,820 --> 00:31:15,010
Yeah.

1209
00:31:15,010 --> 00:31:15,611
One of the girl.

1210
00:31:15,611 --> 00:31:18,140
Does that take some down
passes that garden chokes?

1211
00:31:18,141 --> 00:31:19,000
I don't can choke the shit.

1212
00:31:19,450 --> 00:31:20,680
That could be your shit right there.

1213
00:31:20,860 --> 00:31:21,191
Well,

1214
00:31:21,191 --> 00:31:23,170
you know she got tagged by Amanda Nunez,

1215
00:31:23,410 --> 00:31:26,320
choked out herself like her stand up.

1216
00:31:26,410 --> 00:31:28,000
She has power and her punches.

1217
00:31:28,001 --> 00:31:32,290
She's a big power puncher but she doesn't
have the kind of power that Nunez as

1218
00:31:32,620 --> 00:31:34,830
Nunez is going to be a real
problem for post guidance.

1219
00:31:35,230 --> 00:31:36,130
She might not need it.

1220
00:31:36,220 --> 00:31:37,720
The way she closed that arm triangle.

1221
00:31:37,721 --> 00:31:38,710
It's so professional.

1222
00:31:39,870 --> 00:31:40,630
She's,

1223
00:31:40,630 --> 00:31:41,463
she could,

1224
00:31:41,590 --> 00:31:44,860
she could take most girls
down because of a ruffling.

1225
00:31:45,370 --> 00:31:47,410
She understands she's a finisher.

1226
00:31:47,470 --> 00:31:48,303
She can't take

1227
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:50,471
her husband's.

1228
00:31:50,471 --> 00:31:52,020
Did you get to black belt right?

1229
00:31:52,060 --> 00:31:52,421
Yeah.

1230
00:31:52,421 --> 00:31:53,050
Isn't he a,

1231
00:31:53,050 --> 00:31:54,370
I believe he's a Jujitsu instructor.

1232
00:31:54,371 --> 00:31:55,390
She did it from the mount to,

1233
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:55,810
yeah.

1234
00:31:55,810 --> 00:31:56,560
Very interesting.

1235
00:31:56,560 --> 00:31:59,590
I saw total pumping that grow up.

1236
00:31:59,591 --> 00:32:01,250
That's what she's doing and he's coached.

1237
00:32:01,251 --> 00:32:02,860
Shown her she's going to
be going to be all right.

1238
00:32:02,920 --> 00:32:03,390
I had,

1239
00:32:03,390 --> 00:32:07,780
I had some doubts about her early cause
she said some things about Jujitsu when

1240
00:32:07,781 --> 00:32:08,980
she first came out in the UFC,

1241
00:32:08,990 --> 00:32:09,311
the judge,

1242
00:32:09,311 --> 00:32:10,250
she didn't like Jujitsu.

1243
00:32:10,270 --> 00:32:11,680
She doesn't train Jujitsu
or something like that.

1244
00:32:11,681 --> 00:32:16,681
She was like old school wrestler type of
mentality but it looks like she finally

1245
00:32:17,740 --> 00:32:18,940
had her mind opened.

1246
00:32:19,150 --> 00:32:20,560
You know that was some good,

1247
00:32:20,561 --> 00:32:21,011
that was good.

1248
00:32:21,011 --> 00:32:24,670
Solid guard passing wrestlers just don't
pass guards like that unless they train

1249
00:32:24,671 --> 00:32:25,504
Jujitsu,

1250
00:32:25,690 --> 00:32:26,170
you know,

1251
00:32:26,170 --> 00:32:26,800
wrestlers.

1252
00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:28,630
Some wrestlers never learned
how to pass the guard.

1253
00:32:28,631 --> 00:32:30,730
It kind of seems like that's
a thing of the past though,

1254
00:32:30,731 --> 00:32:31,564
doesn't it?

1255
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:32,021
No,

1256
00:32:32,021 --> 00:32:32,561
exactly.

1257
00:32:32,561 --> 00:32:35,110
That's why I was kind of worried cause
she would say something like that.

1258
00:32:35,111 --> 00:32:35,581
She was saying,

1259
00:32:35,581 --> 00:32:35,701
Nah,

1260
00:32:35,701 --> 00:32:36,520
I don't train Jujitsu.

1261
00:32:36,520 --> 00:32:37,353
Go wait a minute.

1262
00:32:37,390 --> 00:32:40,280
It's 2017 everybody
needs to train Jujitsu.

1263
00:32:40,310 --> 00:32:41,490
If you're fighting in the UFC.

1264
00:32:41,530 --> 00:32:42,363
Yeah.

1265
00:32:42,890 --> 00:32:43,940
You have to love it.

1266
00:32:44,150 --> 00:32:45,200
I never heard her say that.

1267
00:32:45,290 --> 00:32:46,123
Did you,

1268
00:32:46,300 --> 00:32:49,460
what did she say that it
was it like real early,

1269
00:32:49,490 --> 00:32:50,060
early on,

1270
00:32:50,060 --> 00:32:50,893
man.

1271
00:32:51,470 --> 00:32:52,303
Uh,

1272
00:32:53,150 --> 00:32:54,760
she did say something that she,

1273
00:32:54,830 --> 00:32:58,580
something to the effect that
she hasn't liked Jujitsu.

1274
00:32:59,270 --> 00:33:00,100
Well my,

1275
00:33:00,100 --> 00:33:03,920
I guess being a wrestler early and
it's an old school wrestler mentality,

1276
00:33:03,921 --> 00:33:04,550
that's all.

1277
00:33:04,550 --> 00:33:05,383
No big deal.

1278
00:33:05,690 --> 00:33:07,130
The only rust like that.

1279
00:33:07,280 --> 00:33:07,761
Exactly.

1280
00:33:07,761 --> 00:33:08,030
Yeah.

1281
00:33:08,030 --> 00:33:11,450
They're still Russell's like that and
there's been a bunch that were famous to,

1282
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:15,080
well there's always a bunch of people
that get super attached to their style

1283
00:33:15,081 --> 00:33:16,160
that they started out with.

1284
00:33:16,190 --> 00:33:16,861
They want to prove that.

1285
00:33:16,861 --> 00:33:17,550
I don't blame you.

1286
00:33:17,550 --> 00:33:18,081
I don't blame.

1287
00:33:18,081 --> 00:33:18,530
The rest was,

1288
00:33:18,530 --> 00:33:19,071
look what happened.

1289
00:33:19,071 --> 00:33:20,060
Hawaii's shows up.

1290
00:33:20,330 --> 00:33:20,690
Everyone,

1291
00:33:20,690 --> 00:33:20,920
these,

1292
00:33:20,920 --> 00:33:23,450
these Midwestern wrestlers
are looking at this.

1293
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:26,860
Who's this little Mexican kid choking
everybody out beating Russ and they're,

1294
00:33:26,870 --> 00:33:28,760
they're doing challenge matches and great.

1295
00:33:28,970 --> 00:33:29,271
They're like,

1296
00:33:29,271 --> 00:33:30,260
fuck these guys,

1297
00:33:30,261 --> 00:33:30,530
Huh?

1298
00:33:30,530 --> 00:33:32,410
How are they going to take
me down and do that shit?

1299
00:33:32,680 --> 00:33:33,130
Most of,

1300
00:33:33,130 --> 00:33:34,790
most of the rest of that I
ended that are like that.

1301
00:33:35,030 --> 00:33:35,331
They don't,

1302
00:33:35,331 --> 00:33:37,100
they do that because they're fucking lazy.

1303
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:38,233
That's what it says.

1304
00:33:38,300 --> 00:33:39,330
That's what it is because they,

1305
00:33:39,340 --> 00:33:39,680
they're,

1306
00:33:39,680 --> 00:33:43,310
they're so good at
wrestling and they just,

1307
00:33:43,880 --> 00:33:48,350
I just seems like it's just a weird little
like lazy thing for one because it's

1308
00:33:48,351 --> 00:33:49,161
extra work in too,

1309
00:33:49,161 --> 00:33:52,370
because you're going to get fucking
choked out and don't want to lose.

1310
00:33:52,590 --> 00:33:53,423
Right.

1311
00:33:53,780 --> 00:33:57,260
It's that kind of thing where it's
hard for wrestlers to progress.

1312
00:33:57,350 --> 00:33:57,470
Hey,

1313
00:33:57,470 --> 00:33:57,650
look,

1314
00:33:57,650 --> 00:33:59,390
I think it stems from,

1315
00:33:59,420 --> 00:34:02,630
it stems from the Gracies coming out,

1316
00:34:02,900 --> 00:34:05,660
challenging everybody and
beat him getting wrestlers.

1317
00:34:05,930 --> 00:34:06,021
Uh,

1318
00:34:06,021 --> 00:34:06,350
Dan,

1319
00:34:06,350 --> 00:34:08,000
Dan Severn gets choked out.

1320
00:34:08,090 --> 00:34:09,290
Mark Coleman's coming in,

1321
00:34:09,291 --> 00:34:10,850
mark homeless and trying
to pass the guard.

1322
00:34:10,910 --> 00:34:12,800
He was trying to beat
Jujitsu to hold you down.

1323
00:34:13,460 --> 00:34:16,400
But it also stems from the
same thing is with kickboxers.

1324
00:34:16,670 --> 00:34:18,650
Kickboxers don't want
to train Jujitsu either.

1325
00:34:18,651 --> 00:34:21,200
I mean that was always the
problem with certain fighters.

1326
00:34:21,201 --> 00:34:24,650
They just didn't want to get tapped
because we're still good standing again.

1327
00:34:24,680 --> 00:34:29,540
That's from the UFC cause you also saw
the strikers getting taken down easily

1328
00:34:29,541 --> 00:34:30,830
and getting choked out easily.

1329
00:34:30,950 --> 00:34:33,150
So right away dude has been
training 15 years striking.

1330
00:34:33,160 --> 00:34:35,980
It's thinking fuck these
Jujitsu guys fucked though.

1331
00:34:35,981 --> 00:34:38,810
I want to learn a little take down the
fence and I'm a fucking knock 'em out.

1332
00:34:38,890 --> 00:34:39,890
Well that's learning it.

1333
00:34:39,920 --> 00:34:41,270
Fuck learning yet I'm alert.

1334
00:34:41,271 --> 00:34:42,740
Some take down the fence and I'm still,

1335
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:44,960
I'm going to still knock us cro cop.

1336
00:34:45,250 --> 00:34:46,500
So back in the day,

1337
00:34:46,570 --> 00:34:48,910
yeah there was not to stand up.

1338
00:34:49,250 --> 00:34:50,060
Even this whole,

1339
00:34:50,060 --> 00:34:52,780
even this whole thoughts on the
cage and his training in different,

1340
00:34:53,220 --> 00:34:53,450
you know,

1341
00:34:53,450 --> 00:34:54,400
you're like no man,

1342
00:34:54,550 --> 00:34:59,550
you and then that was wrestler versus
striker that that rivalry when you eat

1343
00:35:00,591 --> 00:35:03,140
gorge bulb [inaudible] Mark Kurt,

1344
00:35:03,350 --> 00:35:04,250
are you kidding me?

1345
00:35:04,460 --> 00:35:06,410
That do you remember how
that fight went down?

1346
00:35:06,670 --> 00:35:08,000
Mark change can crack them.

1347
00:35:08,001 --> 00:35:08,250
Yeah.

1348
00:35:08,250 --> 00:35:08,450
Yeah.

1349
00:35:08,450 --> 00:35:12,800
Mark and mark curb took him
down at will and then got tired,

1350
00:35:12,801 --> 00:35:13,760
would never pass the guard.

1351
00:35:13,761 --> 00:35:15,290
Never tried passing the gods above.

1352
00:35:15,291 --> 00:35:16,790
Changin had a decent guard.

1353
00:35:16,910 --> 00:35:18,500
He had a good survival guard.

1354
00:35:18,850 --> 00:35:21,920
He had good guard
recovery and Mark Curtain,

1355
00:35:22,030 --> 00:35:22,220
uh,

1356
00:35:22,220 --> 00:35:23,870
admittedly never worked on passing.

1357
00:35:23,871 --> 00:35:25,550
He just felt that he could
just stay in the garden,

1358
00:35:25,551 --> 00:35:26,330
pound someone,

1359
00:35:26,330 --> 00:35:27,290
but you couldn't do it.

1360
00:35:27,291 --> 00:35:28,130
Devolved off chance involved,

1361
00:35:28,131 --> 00:35:30,590
potentially kept tying them
up and then late in the round,

1362
00:35:30,910 --> 00:35:31,671
late in the fight,

1363
00:35:31,671 --> 00:35:33,230
he couldn't take them down anymore.

1364
00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:34,640
They were both on their feet.

1365
00:35:34,730 --> 00:35:37,410
Marker was folding and
that's when you got to vote.

1366
00:35:37,450 --> 00:35:38,070
Changin

1367
00:35:38,070 --> 00:35:38,730
lit him up.

1368
00:35:38,730 --> 00:35:39,563
Remember that?

1369
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:41,160
It was very interesting back then.

1370
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:45,270
If Mark Kerr what had just spent day one,

1371
00:35:45,271 --> 00:35:46,500
once he decided to do MMA,

1372
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:48,480
let me get rid of good
passing and mountain.

1373
00:35:48,510 --> 00:35:48,841
Okay.

1374
00:35:48,841 --> 00:35:49,530
But will.

1375
00:35:49,530 --> 00:35:50,670
But in all fairness,

1376
00:35:50,700 --> 00:35:52,140
that was the least of his problems.

1377
00:35:52,170 --> 00:35:55,980
That guy was on a million different
drugs that documented this smashing

1378
00:35:55,981 --> 00:35:56,430
machines.

1379
00:35:56,430 --> 00:35:57,840
Such a crazy documentary.

1380
00:35:58,030 --> 00:36:00,630
Shouldn't find out what
exactly he was doing.

1381
00:36:00,660 --> 00:36:00,901
Like,

1382
00:36:00,901 --> 00:36:01,321
whoa.

1383
00:36:01,321 --> 00:36:04,440
Like that guy was fighting the toughest
fighters in the world while he was

1384
00:36:04,441 --> 00:36:05,280
shooting heroin.

1385
00:36:05,640 --> 00:36:05,971
I mean,

1386
00:36:05,971 --> 00:36:06,331
he was,

1387
00:36:06,331 --> 00:36:09,190
he was shooting like all
sorts of crazy paint.

1388
00:36:09,230 --> 00:36:09,360
Oh,

1389
00:36:09,360 --> 00:36:10,230
I didn't know that.

1390
00:36:10,260 --> 00:36:10,450
Oh,

1391
00:36:10,450 --> 00:36:11,080
do,

1392
00:36:11,080 --> 00:36:14,540
did you ever see this smashing machine
who shooting up opiates shooting now he

1393
00:36:14,541 --> 00:36:14,730
was.

1394
00:36:14,730 --> 00:36:16,860
It was all pharmaceutical grade,

1395
00:36:16,861 --> 00:36:17,080
you know,

1396
00:36:17,080 --> 00:36:17,670
painkillers.

1397
00:36:17,670 --> 00:36:20,250
He raised up all the steroids and stuff.

1398
00:36:20,550 --> 00:36:21,600
Crazy documentary.

1399
00:36:21,720 --> 00:36:22,553
You never saw a number this?

1400
00:36:22,660 --> 00:36:23,010
Yes,

1401
00:36:23,010 --> 00:36:24,500
but I just remember the steroid part.

1402
00:36:24,630 --> 00:36:25,050
Oh,

1403
00:36:25,050 --> 00:36:25,883
that was nothing.

1404
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:30,360
He was slamming painkillers and it was
fucking veins and he would just sit in

1405
00:36:30,370 --> 00:36:32,850
there and letting them
film the whole thing.

1406
00:36:32,900 --> 00:36:33,733
Yeah.

1407
00:36:33,850 --> 00:36:36,590
It's like fucking yes,

1408
00:36:36,650 --> 00:36:37,740
exactly what I was described for help.

1409
00:36:37,741 --> 00:36:37,981
But you know,

1410
00:36:37,981 --> 00:36:41,310
fresh bottles of whatever
painkiller he was fucking taking,

1411
00:36:41,740 --> 00:36:42,840
judging it straight in his arm.

1412
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:45,900
They thought when they were filming
him that they were filming the baddest

1413
00:36:45,901 --> 00:36:47,640
motherfucker on the planet
earth and they were like,

1414
00:36:47,641 --> 00:36:48,061
oh my God,

1415
00:36:48,061 --> 00:36:48,900
we're watching this guy.

1416
00:36:48,901 --> 00:36:50,130
Right as he falls apart,

1417
00:36:50,460 --> 00:36:52,900
like right as the filming
started beginning getting,

1418
00:36:52,950 --> 00:36:53,940
he was falling apart.

1419
00:36:54,180 --> 00:36:56,430
Here it is Tony Ferguson.

1420
00:36:56,490 --> 00:36:57,350
So here's the sleep.

1421
00:36:58,050 --> 00:36:59,080
Sheer luck,

1422
00:36:59,081 --> 00:36:59,700
luck.

1423
00:36:59,700 --> 00:37:00,331
What's going on,

1424
00:37:00,331 --> 00:37:02,040
it's going to be very hard to take down.

1425
00:37:02,310 --> 00:37:04,350
And if Khabib takes him down,

1426
00:37:04,440 --> 00:37:06,540
he's got to be really worried about them.

1427
00:37:06,541 --> 00:37:07,860
Chokes that we've already seen.

1428
00:37:07,890 --> 00:37:08,400
Yes.

1429
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:09,060
So He's,

1430
00:37:09,060 --> 00:37:10,320
he can just take down Tony,

1431
00:37:10,321 --> 00:37:15,160
like he did Michael Johnson and not worry
about legit chokes from all sorts of

1432
00:37:15,230 --> 00:37:15,640
[inaudible].

1433
00:37:15,640 --> 00:37:15,810
It's,

1434
00:37:15,810 --> 00:37:17,130
it's all in the transition.

1435
00:37:17,480 --> 00:37:21,360
So it tends to in great Marcella teens,

1436
00:37:21,870 --> 00:37:22,530
if he raps,

1437
00:37:22,530 --> 00:37:23,920
he's always looking for Darcy.

1438
00:37:23,921 --> 00:37:24,754
So,

1439
00:37:24,760 --> 00:37:25,230
uh,

1440
00:37:25,230 --> 00:37:26,063
could be,

1441
00:37:26,070 --> 00:37:26,903
you know,

1442
00:37:27,360 --> 00:37:30,120
he's one of the best grapplers in the UFC.

1443
00:37:30,150 --> 00:37:30,900
No doubt.

1444
00:37:30,900 --> 00:37:35,000
He may be the best at a grounding and
pounding and controlling you like a,

1445
00:37:35,310 --> 00:37:37,620
like a legit high level black belt.

1446
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:38,753
He passes.

1447
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:41,910
Who knows how it's going to
match up against Tony Man.

1448
00:37:41,911 --> 00:37:43,500
But we're preparing everything we can.

1449
00:37:43,501 --> 00:37:43,641
We,

1450
00:37:43,641 --> 00:37:44,730
we're doing everything we can.

1451
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:47,190
I don't know how it's going to
look when it's all said and done,

1452
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:52,400
but we're doing the best we can to
prepare for the worst case scenario.

1453
00:37:52,920 --> 00:37:54,390
Who knows what's going to happen.

1454
00:37:54,570 --> 00:37:55,590
But uh,

1455
00:37:55,591 --> 00:38:00,540
the one thing's for sure is one mistake
on the ground and Tony's going to wrap

1456
00:38:00,550 --> 00:38:00,960
your that.

1457
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:01,793
Yes,

1458
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:03,420
but this motherfucker as well.

1459
00:38:03,450 --> 00:38:03,691
I mean,

1460
00:38:03,691 --> 00:38:05,330
one mistake on the
ground and Habib number,

1461
00:38:05,331 --> 00:38:07,090
good Madoff's going to
fucking break your arms.

1462
00:38:07,250 --> 00:38:07,740
He's,

1463
00:38:07,740 --> 00:38:08,431
he's a freak.

1464
00:38:08,431 --> 00:38:10,170
And that's why this is so an interesting,

1465
00:38:10,290 --> 00:38:11,700
because Tony's a freak too.

1466
00:38:11,880 --> 00:38:15,240
And like when you see Tony
fucking up Hofeld dos Anjos here.

1467
00:38:15,480 --> 00:38:15,960
I mean,

1468
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:16,290
man,

1469
00:38:16,290 --> 00:38:20,100
Tony Ferguson easily could have been the
UFC lightweight champion of the world

1470
00:38:20,101 --> 00:38:23,220
if he caught Hofeld Dosantos
when dos Anjos had the bell,

1471
00:38:23,370 --> 00:38:24,210
he could have got him.

1472
00:38:24,690 --> 00:38:25,471
And you know,

1473
00:38:25,471 --> 00:38:25,860
Tony,

1474
00:38:25,860 --> 00:38:27,510
I think Tony could do that to anybody.

1475
00:38:27,630 --> 00:38:28,140
How did the,

1476
00:38:28,140 --> 00:38:28,940
how did he beat,

1477
00:38:28,940 --> 00:38:29,610
um,

1478
00:38:29,610 --> 00:38:30,600
Barboza was he,

1479
00:38:30,601 --> 00:38:32,150
did you just choke Barboza yes,

1480
00:38:32,540 --> 00:38:33,111
he dodged him,

1481
00:38:33,111 --> 00:38:33,490
right?

1482
00:38:33,490 --> 00:38:34,270
Yeah.

1483
00:38:34,270 --> 00:38:34,651
That was it.

1484
00:38:34,651 --> 00:38:34,960
Right here.

1485
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:35,970
I'm standing and I'm

1486
00:38:35,990 --> 00:38:37,120
finished him off on the ground.

1487
00:38:37,121 --> 00:38:37,781
It was perfect.

1488
00:38:37,781 --> 00:38:38,021
Tony.

1489
00:38:38,021 --> 00:38:41,140
Something special and that's why this
fight is so interesting because hubby was

1490
00:38:41,141 --> 00:38:42,280
obviously something special.

1491
00:38:42,281 --> 00:38:46,870
He's the only guy that's a contender that
has been fighting the best guys in the

1492
00:38:46,871 --> 00:38:49,240
world and is undefeated as
he fights for the title.

1493
00:38:49,270 --> 00:38:50,260
That's so unheard of.

1494
00:38:50,710 --> 00:38:52,240
Everybody may get one or two.

1495
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:53,890
Everybody's got early in their career.

1496
00:38:53,891 --> 00:38:55,750
They've got a fight or two that they lost,

1497
00:38:55,751 --> 00:39:00,751
but he's one of the very few guys that
has only shown one moment in his entire

1498
00:39:01,091 --> 00:39:04,930
career inside the octagon where
he really didn't look so good.

1499
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:07,960
And that was a brief moment
where Michael Johnson hit him.

1500
00:39:08,140 --> 00:39:11,410
Obviously he recovered from that and
came back to that as much smashed him

1501
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:12,340
smushed down.

1502
00:39:12,760 --> 00:39:13,061
He just,

1503
00:39:13,061 --> 00:39:14,500
when he gets guys on the ground,

1504
00:39:14,501 --> 00:39:16,600
it's almost like he's a
different weight class than them.

1505
00:39:16,730 --> 00:39:17,270
Yeah.

1506
00:39:17,270 --> 00:39:19,400
There's levels,

1507
00:39:19,460 --> 00:39:23,950
thousands of levels of being
heavy and he's super heavy.

1508
00:39:23,951 --> 00:39:24,890
He sticks on.

1509
00:39:24,891 --> 00:39:25,724
He's a great guy.

1510
00:39:25,970 --> 00:39:28,180
I saw him in person at my fight.

1511
00:39:28,190 --> 00:39:32,330
That fight the law was supposed to happen
is passing a big his passing to from

1512
00:39:32,331 --> 00:39:35,550
full guard or to like open
guard right into he forces a,

1513
00:39:36,030 --> 00:39:38,510
a z guard or a quarter z.

1514
00:39:38,570 --> 00:39:43,570
Like right away there's movement to set
up the half guard that he's going to try

1515
00:39:43,701 --> 00:39:44,420
to pass.

1516
00:39:44,420 --> 00:39:44,991
Brilliant.

1517
00:39:44,991 --> 00:39:46,400
His knee slash is brilliant.

1518
00:39:46,620 --> 00:39:47,060
Uh,

1519
00:39:47,060 --> 00:39:48,500
his mount is control.

1520
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:49,850
That crucifix move,

1521
00:39:50,090 --> 00:39:50,511
man.

1522
00:39:50,511 --> 00:39:51,344
He's a black.

1523
00:39:52,130 --> 00:39:53,000
Everybody knows it.

1524
00:39:53,001 --> 00:39:53,990
Very few people do it.

1525
00:39:53,991 --> 00:39:54,470
Yeah,

1526
00:39:54,470 --> 00:39:54,800
he's,

1527
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:56,090
he's always looking for it.

1528
00:39:56,480 --> 00:39:57,500
And obviously he's,

1529
00:39:57,501 --> 00:39:57,711
you know,

1530
00:39:57,711 --> 00:39:58,940
if you look at his earlier fights,

1531
00:39:58,941 --> 00:40:00,230
he's got triangle chokes.

1532
00:40:00,231 --> 00:40:00,441
I mean,

1533
00:40:00,441 --> 00:40:01,820
he could finish off your back too.

1534
00:40:02,050 --> 00:40:02,630
He's,

1535
00:40:02,630 --> 00:40:04,330
so that's a tall order,

1536
00:40:04,580 --> 00:40:05,870
tall order for Tony.

1537
00:40:05,871 --> 00:40:07,760
But believe you me,

1538
00:40:08,030 --> 00:40:12,440
Tony is looking pretty damn good
to me right now on the ground.

1539
00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:14,870
So it's going to be,

1540
00:40:14,980 --> 00:40:15,813
um,

1541
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:18,680
crazy seeing how it all plays out.

1542
00:40:19,410 --> 00:40:19,940
Yeah.

1543
00:40:19,940 --> 00:40:21,110
I'm so excited for that dude.

1544
00:40:21,220 --> 00:40:21,411
I'm,

1545
00:40:21,411 --> 00:40:22,610
my head's going to explode.

1546
00:40:23,100 --> 00:40:23,401
Yeah.

1547
00:40:23,401 --> 00:40:24,450
It's so crazy fight and it's,

1548
00:40:24,460 --> 00:40:27,300
it's going to be even more crazy if
you just got so much invested in it.

1549
00:40:27,630 --> 00:40:27,841
You know,

1550
00:40:27,841 --> 00:40:30,780
for me as a guy that gets to
sit there and call that fight,

1551
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:34,470
I'm fascinated just because when
you see a guy like Tony Ferguson,

1552
00:40:34,950 --> 00:40:35,311
you know,

1553
00:40:35,311 --> 00:40:36,180
he's a problem.

1554
00:40:36,390 --> 00:40:37,740
Like how do you solve that problem?

1555
00:40:37,741 --> 00:40:39,480
Like what's the solution to that problem?

1556
00:40:39,990 --> 00:40:40,331
And,

1557
00:40:40,331 --> 00:40:40,710
um,

1558
00:40:40,710 --> 00:40:42,240
I don't know what the answer to that is.

1559
00:40:42,540 --> 00:40:42,781
You know,

1560
00:40:42,781 --> 00:40:47,010
I would say a guy who can keep the fight
standing up and tee off on them and

1561
00:40:47,011 --> 00:40:48,150
land good strikes,

1562
00:40:48,330 --> 00:40:51,430
like maybe a guy who takes advantage of
the aggressive style that number grew

1563
00:40:51,431 --> 00:40:52,264
Madoff has.

1564
00:40:53,220 --> 00:40:54,053
But you know,

1565
00:40:54,240 --> 00:40:55,170
maybe Tony's that guy,

1566
00:40:55,290 --> 00:40:57,090
it's going to be interesting as as,

1567
00:40:57,091 --> 00:40:57,924
um,

1568
00:40:58,050 --> 00:40:58,771
Michael Johnson Shell,

1569
00:40:58,771 --> 00:40:59,071
you can't,

1570
00:40:59,071 --> 00:40:59,760
you can't punch him,

1571
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:01,260
you can't hit him and we
can land and get shot.

1572
00:41:01,260 --> 00:41:02,093
You can rock him.

1573
00:41:03,360 --> 00:41:07,290
And I think that that's going to
be the main place to catch him.

1574
00:41:07,590 --> 00:41:08,640
But if you can catch him,

1575
00:41:08,850 --> 00:41:09,900
keep on the outside,

1576
00:41:11,060 --> 00:41:11,440
you know,

1577
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:13,950
you don't want a guy like
that who fights of that way,

1578
00:41:14,160 --> 00:41:16,530
that good at grappling and that could
arresting and takedowns and constant

1579
00:41:16,531 --> 00:41:18,060
pressure in your face the whole time.

1580
00:41:18,061 --> 00:41:18,960
He got to keep them outside.

1581
00:41:19,770 --> 00:41:21,870
And then I think Tony tell
him up to do it because again,

1582
00:41:22,110 --> 00:41:25,560
seeing how small could be
was last weekend I was like,

1583
00:41:25,561 --> 00:41:25,711
man,

1584
00:41:25,711 --> 00:41:26,700
he's not that big of a guy.

1585
00:41:27,270 --> 00:41:27,650
You know,

1586
00:41:27,650 --> 00:41:28,650
I'm a huge fan of his,

1587
00:41:28,651 --> 00:41:29,670
I think he's fucking awesome.

1588
00:41:29,880 --> 00:41:33,500
But he walks around big 75 maybe,

1589
00:41:33,560 --> 00:41:34,393
maybe,

1590
00:41:34,760 --> 00:41:34,941
you know,

1591
00:41:34,941 --> 00:41:35,720
he just didn't see he,

1592
00:41:35,720 --> 00:41:38,420
and you know how the Russians travel
there always in groups of fucking a

1593
00:41:38,421 --> 00:41:39,020
hundred.

1594
00:41:39,020 --> 00:41:39,590
Yeah.

1595
00:41:39,590 --> 00:41:40,780
So it's always entertaining and they're,

1596
00:41:40,790 --> 00:41:42,200
they're fucking hilarious.

1597
00:41:42,320 --> 00:41:44,090
But he's just didn't seem that big at all.

1598
00:41:44,150 --> 00:41:44,421
I was like,

1599
00:41:44,421 --> 00:41:45,000
wow,

1600
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:45,833
huh.

1601
00:41:46,490 --> 00:41:46,761
That was,

1602
00:41:46,761 --> 00:41:49,000
that was the only thing that shot
him because he's so strong magnets.

1603
00:41:49,140 --> 00:41:50,570
Everybody we saying something.

1604
00:41:50,630 --> 00:41:51,260
Oh I'm hearing the,

1605
00:41:51,260 --> 00:41:52,280
I thought that was you.

1606
00:41:52,990 --> 00:41:53,630
Okay.

1607
00:41:53,630 --> 00:41:55,310
The problem with the TVs up a little loud.

1608
00:41:55,311 --> 00:41:55,950
I'm confused.

1609
00:41:55,950 --> 00:41:56,783
You would think like,

1610
00:41:56,890 --> 00:41:57,190
he,

1611
00:41:57,190 --> 00:42:00,430
he'd be built like he bow
to ragdoll seem like the,

1612
00:42:00,440 --> 00:42:03,620
I think the glaze and t bell
thing only works without Usada.

1613
00:42:04,240 --> 00:42:04,860
Yeah.

1614
00:42:04,860 --> 00:42:06,620
Do you know when Grayson
got popped and they,

1615
00:42:06,670 --> 00:42:08,630
they found like a punch
of different shit in them.

1616
00:42:08,660 --> 00:42:08,991
They're like,

1617
00:42:08,991 --> 00:42:09,824
dude,

1618
00:42:10,070 --> 00:42:14,300
I mean if anybody was going to get caught
glazed and t bow looked like it was

1619
00:42:14,301 --> 00:42:19,301
300 pounds and it was fighting
one 55 so fucking big.

1620
00:42:20,570 --> 00:42:24,260
I'd never seen anybody that was remotely
as big as glazing when Grayson was at

1621
00:42:24,261 --> 00:42:25,000
the top.

1622
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:25,430
See,

1623
00:42:25,430 --> 00:42:26,540
gets so massive.

1624
00:42:26,550 --> 00:42:27,890
Like he was so big,

1625
00:42:28,070 --> 00:42:29,150
he was so big.

1626
00:42:29,500 --> 00:42:30,790
He was Jack.

1627
00:42:30,830 --> 00:42:31,610
He cutting from,

1628
00:42:31,610 --> 00:42:35,420
from over 200 pounds and
Sha readed like completely,

1629
00:42:35,421 --> 00:42:36,410
totally shredded.

1630
00:42:37,190 --> 00:42:37,711
I was a,

1631
00:42:37,711 --> 00:42:39,410
I was touched sparring with um,

1632
00:42:39,710 --> 00:42:41,690
with RDA the other day cause he's,

1633
00:42:41,691 --> 00:42:41,810
you know,

1634
00:42:41,810 --> 00:42:43,800
I'm trying to get Ruca now and,

1635
00:42:43,801 --> 00:42:45,920
and he's over there a
little bit and I was like,

1636
00:42:45,921 --> 00:42:46,071
dude,

1637
00:42:46,071 --> 00:42:47,480
you're not that much taller than me.

1638
00:42:47,481 --> 00:42:48,880
But he's probably 205 pounds.

1639
00:42:49,160 --> 00:42:49,580
Wow.

1640
00:42:49,580 --> 00:42:50,450
Fucking huge.

1641
00:42:51,050 --> 00:42:52,010
And he's welterweight now.

1642
00:42:52,100 --> 00:42:52,400
Yeah.

1643
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:55,140
But I'm just trying to move
him and trying to just,

1644
00:42:55,160 --> 00:42:55,351
you know,

1645
00:42:55,351 --> 00:42:58,400
are playing but trying to foot
sweeps and I do the fun shit.

1646
00:42:59,180 --> 00:42:59,931
Jesus Christ,

1647
00:42:59,931 --> 00:43:00,950
he's really heavy.

1648
00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:02,110
Really?

1649
00:43:02,110 --> 00:43:02,510
Yeah.

1650
00:43:02,510 --> 00:43:05,330
He's decided to go the way of
Donald's Serone move on up.

1651
00:43:07,220 --> 00:43:08,090
I don't think it's a bad idea.

1652
00:43:08,460 --> 00:43:09,293
Not Mom.

1653
00:43:09,980 --> 00:43:10,813
Again,

1654
00:43:10,970 --> 00:43:12,080
I keep going back to this,

1655
00:43:12,081 --> 00:43:12,711
but I'll say it again.

1656
00:43:12,711 --> 00:43:14,330
I think it's the worst thing
in fighting his weight.

1657
00:43:14,331 --> 00:43:15,140
Cutting.

1658
00:43:15,140 --> 00:43:16,160
I think it's the worst thing.

1659
00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:19,550
I think you're seeing guys that make the
weight but they can't fight up to their

1660
00:43:19,551 --> 00:43:19,911
ability,

1661
00:43:19,911 --> 00:43:22,970
their bodies compromised even though
their mind is willing and they feel like

1662
00:43:23,090 --> 00:43:24,410
pretty gangster about it all.

1663
00:43:24,950 --> 00:43:25,610
They,

1664
00:43:25,610 --> 00:43:27,740
they dose don't fight the way they can.

1665
00:43:28,190 --> 00:43:30,650
And when they move up you
see him fight much better.

1666
00:43:30,830 --> 00:43:31,221
I mean,

1667
00:43:31,221 --> 00:43:32,054
barring Donald,

1668
00:43:32,140 --> 00:43:32,973
his last fight,

1669
00:43:33,860 --> 00:43:34,221
which,

1670
00:43:34,221 --> 00:43:34,760
um,

1671
00:43:34,760 --> 00:43:36,950
I think Brendan Schaub had a really
good point when he said it was just too

1672
00:43:36,951 --> 00:43:39,500
close to that fight that
he had with Matt Brown.

1673
00:43:39,620 --> 00:43:40,670
He got rocked in that fight.

1674
00:43:40,671 --> 00:43:44,210
He got dropped in that fight and he
just looked like he was vulnerable.

1675
00:43:44,540 --> 00:43:45,470
But then again,

1676
00:43:45,500 --> 00:43:47,470
he's also fighting Jorge Mosbey Dahl,

1677
00:43:47,490 --> 00:43:48,950
who's a bad motherfucker.

1678
00:43:49,350 --> 00:43:50,960
Jorge's a very interested,

1679
00:43:51,200 --> 00:43:53,750
very talented guy and very diverse.

1680
00:43:53,751 --> 00:43:57,080
He can do everything and slick [inaudible]
guys that's been under pressure so

1681
00:43:57,081 --> 00:43:57,914
many times,

1682
00:43:58,070 --> 00:43:59,660
not even in his fighting career.

1683
00:43:59,690 --> 00:44:03,590
You see where the guy came up
and all these crazy ass videos,

1684
00:44:03,591 --> 00:44:08,090
even fighting on the street and back
yards that he is very calm under pressure.

1685
00:44:08,270 --> 00:44:08,840
He is,

1686
00:44:08,840 --> 00:44:10,370
and he is also,

1687
00:44:10,430 --> 00:44:11,000
you know,

1688
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:11,840
he's unpredictable.

1689
00:44:11,860 --> 00:44:11,960
Yeah.

1690
00:44:11,960 --> 00:44:13,220
Like he likes to mix things up.

1691
00:44:13,221 --> 00:44:16,070
He's real good at doing
whatever the hell he wants.

1692
00:44:16,340 --> 00:44:16,580
You know,

1693
00:44:16,580 --> 00:44:17,750
he's had fights where he got hurt.

1694
00:44:17,751 --> 00:44:20,030
Like Darin Cruickshank heard him and uh,

1695
00:44:20,031 --> 00:44:20,301
he said,

1696
00:44:20,301 --> 00:44:20,720
all right,

1697
00:44:20,720 --> 00:44:21,140
dude,

1698
00:44:21,140 --> 00:44:22,430
turn this into a wrestling match.

1699
00:44:22,431 --> 00:44:23,960
And he just wrestled him to the ground,

1700
00:44:23,961 --> 00:44:24,794
beat the shit out of him.

1701
00:44:25,820 --> 00:44:26,720
He's a real versatile,

1702
00:44:26,750 --> 00:44:27,441
he can do anything.

1703
00:44:27,441 --> 00:44:29,150
And so Donald lost to him.

1704
00:44:29,360 --> 00:44:30,800
I think that's a tough fight for Donald,

1705
00:44:30,801 --> 00:44:31,890
even if Donald wasn't hurt.

1706
00:44:32,020 --> 00:44:32,330
Yeah.

1707
00:44:32,330 --> 00:44:32,581
You know?

1708
00:44:32,581 --> 00:44:33,570
So take that out of the way.

1709
00:44:33,571 --> 00:44:35,940
I think Donald at one seven he's
look better than he's ever looked at.

1710
00:44:35,941 --> 00:44:37,170
One 55 by far.

1711
00:44:37,350 --> 00:44:38,280
And I just think that's,

1712
00:44:38,820 --> 00:44:39,241
you know,

1713
00:44:39,241 --> 00:44:43,770
I think that's a function
of this disintegration of
your skills that comes with

1714
00:44:43,771 --> 00:44:44,431
the losing the weight.

1715
00:44:44,431 --> 00:44:46,620
It's like what's the point
of diminishing returns?

1716
00:44:46,621 --> 00:44:49,770
When do you get where the diminishing
or the cutting of the weight,

1717
00:44:50,220 --> 00:44:50,451
the,

1718
00:44:50,451 --> 00:44:54,420
the benefit that you get in the size
is not enough to overcome the amount of

1719
00:44:54,421 --> 00:44:55,254
weakening.

1720
00:44:55,270 --> 00:44:55,590
Yes.

1721
00:44:55,590 --> 00:44:56,610
That your body's done.

1722
00:44:58,230 --> 00:45:03,230
Like Tony's a good size for 55 like Tony
probably done get over one 75 like what

1723
00:45:03,781 --> 00:45:07,140
does telling me walk
around at very easy cuts.

1724
00:45:07,290 --> 00:45:07,530
Yeah.

1725
00:45:07,530 --> 00:45:08,460
He don't fuck around.

1726
00:45:08,490 --> 00:45:08,701
Yeah,

1727
00:45:08,701 --> 00:45:10,170
that's the right way or easy cut.

1728
00:45:10,310 --> 00:45:11,170
That's the right way.

1729
00:45:11,280 --> 00:45:12,870
He's dude,

1730
00:45:12,871 --> 00:45:13,970
I'll never forget her leaving.

1731
00:45:13,971 --> 00:45:14,580
Cutting.

1732
00:45:14,580 --> 00:45:18,390
Never Forget Travis Luder when Travis
Luder fought Anderson Silva for the title

1733
00:45:18,391 --> 00:45:20,640
and I've watched Travis shuffle to the,

1734
00:45:20,730 --> 00:45:24,210
to the scale because he couldn't walk
because he couldn't pick his legs up.

1735
00:45:24,450 --> 00:45:25,231
He was shuffling,

1736
00:45:25,231 --> 00:45:27,480
his lips were all cracked and he was like,

1737
00:45:27,510 --> 00:45:29,160
there was blood coming out of his lips.

1738
00:45:29,520 --> 00:45:30,840
Like you could see the skin,

1739
00:45:30,860 --> 00:45:31,391
like the skin.

1740
00:45:31,391 --> 00:45:32,224
It was broken.

1741
00:45:32,260 --> 00:45:32,730
Yeah.

1742
00:45:32,730 --> 00:45:34,740
Like his body had no water in it,

1743
00:45:34,770 --> 00:45:35,760
there was nothing left.

1744
00:45:35,761 --> 00:45:37,160
He was done and he did it.

1745
00:45:37,170 --> 00:45:41,430
Still didn't make the weight and he
took Anderson Silva down at will mounted

1746
00:45:41,431 --> 00:45:41,641
them.

1747
00:45:41,641 --> 00:45:44,610
I mean Travis Luder
was a bad motherfucker.

1748
00:45:44,850 --> 00:45:47,910
He's one of those people that people
forgot cause he was one of the best

1749
00:45:47,911 --> 00:45:50,340
American Brazilian Jujitsu
black belt at the time.

1750
00:45:50,610 --> 00:45:52,620
Like super respected Brazilian Jiu Jitsu,

1751
00:45:52,621 --> 00:45:53,454
black belt.

1752
00:45:53,700 --> 00:45:55,680
And does ea world any world titles?

1753
00:45:56,550 --> 00:45:57,580
I don't think so.

1754
00:45:58,060 --> 00:46:00,600
I don't know what he's one
as far as grappling Edie.

1755
00:46:00,780 --> 00:46:00,991
Andy,

1756
00:46:00,991 --> 00:46:01,824
what do you think?

1757
00:46:02,310 --> 00:46:03,143
I don't know.

1758
00:46:03,150 --> 00:46:03,930
I don't know.

1759
00:46:03,930 --> 00:46:05,200
But he was upset,

1760
00:46:05,220 --> 00:46:06,510
was one of the best in his,

1761
00:46:06,570 --> 00:46:07,560
in his time.

1762
00:46:07,800 --> 00:46:08,221
You know,

1763
00:46:08,221 --> 00:46:09,031
he was up there,

1764
00:46:09,031 --> 00:46:12,750
he was right up there with
anybody as far as grappling goes.

1765
00:46:13,590 --> 00:46:15,180
And you would see it when
he was fighting guys,

1766
00:46:15,181 --> 00:46:16,620
he would just pass their guard,

1767
00:46:16,621 --> 00:46:19,100
get the mount fucking spin
for an arm bar and be like,

1768
00:46:19,110 --> 00:46:19,650
Ooh,

1769
00:46:19,650 --> 00:46:20,700
that's how he's supposed to do it.

1770
00:46:21,240 --> 00:46:22,260
And they're hyping this fight up.

1771
00:46:22,261 --> 00:46:23,094
I love it.

1772
00:46:24,480 --> 00:46:25,560
I boob attorney focusing.

1773
00:46:25,770 --> 00:46:27,270
You see Josh Koscheck fight yesterday.

1774
00:46:27,271 --> 00:46:28,160
That was kind of sad.

1775
00:46:29,130 --> 00:46:30,300
Koscheck got rocked.

1776
00:46:30,690 --> 00:46:33,450
They got taken out and
that Thompson got Josh.

1777
00:46:33,480 --> 00:46:34,261
Josh got knocked out.

1778
00:46:34,261 --> 00:46:34,560
You right.

1779
00:46:34,560 --> 00:46:34,750
Yeah.

1780
00:46:34,750 --> 00:46:35,583
Taken out too.

1781
00:46:36,960 --> 00:46:38,100
I just think after a while,

1782
00:46:38,101 --> 00:46:38,850
man,

1783
00:46:38,850 --> 00:46:39,271
you know,

1784
00:46:39,271 --> 00:46:40,104
there's nothing,

1785
00:46:40,170 --> 00:46:42,840
not that much durability
left in the brain.

1786
00:46:43,370 --> 00:46:46,020
Thompson got it looks like
you've got headbutted first.

1787
00:46:46,440 --> 00:46:50,140
And then he got clipped with a little
bit of a left hand and then they read

1788
00:46:50,160 --> 00:46:52,650
engaged and then he got
caught with a big upper cut.

1789
00:46:53,220 --> 00:46:55,100
He just slumped that.

1790
00:46:55,180 --> 00:46:57,090
That pit bull dude can punch though.

1791
00:46:57,150 --> 00:46:57,630
Yeah.

1792
00:46:57,630 --> 00:46:58,371
Oh Shit.

1793
00:46:58,371 --> 00:46:59,430
I bought those brothers can crack.

1794
00:46:59,910 --> 00:47:00,160
Yeah.

1795
00:47:00,160 --> 00:47:00,993
Both those brothers.

1796
00:47:02,100 --> 00:47:02,371
Yeah.

1797
00:47:02,371 --> 00:47:03,204
So it's uh,

1798
00:47:03,450 --> 00:47:04,283
you know,

1799
00:47:04,460 --> 00:47:05,110
Bella Bella,

1800
00:47:05,110 --> 00:47:06,960
tor is no fucking joke right now,

1801
00:47:06,961 --> 00:47:07,201
man.

1802
00:47:07,201 --> 00:47:08,130
Bella tour has guts,

1803
00:47:08,340 --> 00:47:10,380
especially they're 170 pound division.

1804
00:47:10,590 --> 00:47:12,240
Douglas Lema is a killer.

1805
00:47:12,450 --> 00:47:14,280
He's a fucking killer dude.

1806
00:47:14,730 --> 00:47:18,780
The way he took out Corish cloth and
after Korskoff fucked up Benson Henderson.

1807
00:47:18,920 --> 00:47:19,090
Yeah.

1808
00:47:19,090 --> 00:47:21,810
Just lets you know like
that is a shit division.

1809
00:47:22,350 --> 00:47:23,280
It's a really good guys.

1810
00:47:23,281 --> 00:47:27,630
And now you got Paul Daley there and you
got Michael Venom page and then you got

1811
00:47:27,631 --> 00:47:29,920
Roy MacDonald that they uh,

1812
00:47:30,040 --> 00:47:31,600
who had Robert Down with fights,

1813
00:47:32,710 --> 00:47:33,310
which one?

1814
00:47:33,310 --> 00:47:33,911
He fights.

1815
00:47:33,911 --> 00:47:34,744
Um,

1816
00:47:34,960 --> 00:47:35,471
Jesus Christ.

1817
00:47:35,471 --> 00:47:36,040
What do we just say?

1818
00:47:36,040 --> 00:47:37,020
He fights a device.

1819
00:47:37,060 --> 00:47:38,230
One of them in April.

1820
00:47:38,470 --> 00:47:39,040
Paul Dale.

1821
00:47:39,040 --> 00:47:39,611
Jesus Christ.

1822
00:47:39,611 --> 00:47:40,444
Why can't I say his name?

1823
00:47:40,540 --> 00:47:41,373
He fights Paul Daley.

1824
00:47:41,380 --> 00:47:41,621
Yeah,

1825
00:47:41,621 --> 00:47:41,971
that's a,

1826
00:47:41,971 --> 00:47:42,970
and I think it's in May.

1827
00:47:43,720 --> 00:47:44,081
That's going to be,

1828
00:47:44,081 --> 00:47:44,914
if it's a big fight.

1829
00:47:45,250 --> 00:47:45,700
Yeah.

1830
00:47:45,700 --> 00:47:48,910
It's a big fight because all I do has
to do is just barely connected to your

1831
00:47:48,911 --> 00:47:49,570
brain.

1832
00:47:49,570 --> 00:47:49,741
Well,

1833
00:47:49,741 --> 00:47:52,570
Roy has been having a problem
for a long time with his nose,

1834
00:47:52,630 --> 00:47:55,780
so he decided to take a full year
off and let us know his heel.

1835
00:47:56,200 --> 00:47:56,531
And,

1836
00:47:56,531 --> 00:47:56,720
uh,

1837
00:47:56,720 --> 00:47:59,380
that was when he signed for belt or that
was the understanding that he was going

1838
00:47:59,381 --> 00:48:02,080
to take all this time off and let us
know as heel because every time you get

1839
00:48:02,081 --> 00:48:04,570
punched in the nose we just start
bleeding bad and he wouldn't be able to

1840
00:48:04,571 --> 00:48:05,181
breathe out of it.

1841
00:48:05,181 --> 00:48:06,350
And you have to open your mouth up.

1842
00:48:06,460 --> 00:48:07,293
Yeah.

1843
00:48:07,990 --> 00:48:10,450
I don't know if he's any surgery
or anything to to fix it,

1844
00:48:10,451 --> 00:48:14,290
but he thinks he could fix
it by taking time off maybe.

1845
00:48:15,310 --> 00:48:17,960
And then that seems like something you
have to have some sort of surgery done.

1846
00:48:18,220 --> 00:48:18,910
Yeah,

1847
00:48:18,910 --> 00:48:20,490
I mean I don't know what
can figure everything.

1848
00:48:20,680 --> 00:48:21,011
Yeah.

1849
00:48:21,011 --> 00:48:21,910
I don't know what the damage was.

1850
00:48:21,911 --> 00:48:23,110
But after that Robbie Lawler fight,

1851
00:48:23,111 --> 00:48:23,531
I mean that,

1852
00:48:23,531 --> 00:48:24,011
that knows.

1853
00:48:24,011 --> 00:48:24,910
Got smushed.

1854
00:48:25,860 --> 00:48:26,860
This is an interesting fight.

1855
00:48:26,910 --> 00:48:27,631
The last Theodore.

1856
00:48:27,631 --> 00:48:29,680
Oh versus say Zolpha hey ya

1857
00:48:31,690 --> 00:48:32,031
say hey.

1858
00:48:32,031 --> 00:48:35,020
It was highly touted after he won
the ultimate fighter in Brazil.

1859
00:48:35,800 --> 00:48:38,200
I think I found on the same
card as him a long time ago.

1860
00:48:38,290 --> 00:48:39,160
So big fella.

1861
00:48:39,190 --> 00:48:39,790
Yeah.

1862
00:48:39,790 --> 00:48:43,480
So big fella to be making
185 pounds to two guys giant.

1863
00:48:43,690 --> 00:48:43,991
What does he,

1864
00:48:43,991 --> 00:48:46,880
is he the one that was like
a protege to be Twitter?

1865
00:48:46,930 --> 00:48:47,160
Yeah.

1866
00:48:47,160 --> 00:48:47,310
Okay.

1867
00:48:47,310 --> 00:48:47,860
The other key,

1868
00:48:47,860 --> 00:48:48,271
he's the one that,

1869
00:48:48,271 --> 00:48:48,780
yeah.

1870
00:48:48,780 --> 00:48:48,910
Yeah.

1871
00:48:48,910 --> 00:48:49,743
He's large.

1872
00:48:49,910 --> 00:48:50,350
He's eat.

1873
00:48:50,350 --> 00:48:51,520
Door's gonna Fight Calvin.

1874
00:48:51,690 --> 00:48:53,590
One Dat is interesting.

1875
00:48:53,890 --> 00:48:54,311
Calvin.

1876
00:48:54,311 --> 00:48:55,144
Looks good.

1877
00:48:56,010 --> 00:48:58,670
We're going to be building up
buzz saw through veto I think.

1878
00:48:58,671 --> 00:48:59,504
I think so.

1879
00:48:59,560 --> 00:49:00,070
I think so.

1880
00:49:00,070 --> 00:49:01,270
But Vito is fighting in Brazil.

1881
00:49:02,620 --> 00:49:03,940
Is that going to have any factor?

1882
00:49:03,970 --> 00:49:04,280
I am.

1883
00:49:04,280 --> 00:49:05,140
Don't know.

1884
00:49:06,580 --> 00:49:07,413
I thought they do.

1885
00:49:07,600 --> 00:49:09,810
They go down like who's they do Sada.

1886
00:49:10,710 --> 00:49:13,240
But you'd make a terrible mobster,

1887
00:49:18,950 --> 00:49:21,450
you know the thing God,

1888
00:49:21,470 --> 00:49:21,840
well,

1889
00:49:21,840 --> 00:49:22,650
the thing that,

1890
00:49:22,650 --> 00:49:23,021
that the,

1891
00:49:23,021 --> 00:49:24,760
you know the guy.

1892
00:49:26,210 --> 00:49:26,500
Okay.

1893
00:49:26,500 --> 00:49:26,861
Yeah.

1894
00:49:26,861 --> 00:49:28,660
They're a man Jeff to Wicki.

1895
00:49:28,661 --> 00:49:29,020
I got it.

1896
00:49:29,020 --> 00:49:29,201
I,

1897
00:49:29,201 --> 00:49:30,034
you know,

1898
00:49:30,250 --> 00:49:30,570
I've,

1899
00:49:30,570 --> 00:49:31,510
I've become a fan.

1900
00:49:31,840 --> 00:49:32,673
He's a bulldog.

1901
00:49:32,860 --> 00:49:33,730
He's a fucking Aye.

1902
00:49:33,770 --> 00:49:34,260
Aye.

1903
00:49:34,260 --> 00:49:35,093
Aye.

1904
00:49:35,640 --> 00:49:36,100
You know,

1905
00:49:36,100 --> 00:49:38,020
you can see how most athletes
would look at him and be like,

1906
00:49:38,021 --> 00:49:38,681
fuck this guy,

1907
00:49:38,681 --> 00:49:38,951
you know,

1908
00:49:38,951 --> 00:49:39,191
just,

1909
00:49:39,191 --> 00:49:40,930
just strictly for his job alone.

1910
00:49:41,140 --> 00:49:42,610
But the guy's been,

1911
00:49:42,611 --> 00:49:43,001
you know,

1912
00:49:43,001 --> 00:49:43,990
been very good to me.

1913
00:49:44,050 --> 00:49:44,860
He's a good dude.

1914
00:49:44,860 --> 00:49:45,040
Yeah.

1915
00:49:45,040 --> 00:49:45,701
Jeff's a good dude.

1916
00:49:45,701 --> 00:49:46,810
He's a very smart guy too.

1917
00:49:46,840 --> 00:49:47,260
Yeah.

1918
00:49:47,260 --> 00:49:47,980
And um,

1919
00:49:47,980 --> 00:49:48,850
he's not fucking around,

1920
00:49:48,851 --> 00:49:49,140
man.

1921
00:49:49,140 --> 00:49:51,100
He's cleaning sportup singlehandedly.

1922
00:49:51,180 --> 00:49:53,380
You seen people fall off the map?

1923
00:49:53,440 --> 00:49:53,860
Yeah.

1924
00:49:53,860 --> 00:49:56,200
And some of them are on this car tonight.

1925
00:49:58,240 --> 00:49:59,073
One.

1926
00:49:59,230 --> 00:50:00,063
One.

1927
00:50:00,160 --> 00:50:00,760
Yeah.

1928
00:50:00,760 --> 00:50:04,990
I mean I literally like you've seen him
fall off the map because they're not the

1929
00:50:04,991 --> 00:50:06,250
same without the shit.

1930
00:50:06,940 --> 00:50:07,773
Exactly.

1931
00:50:07,880 --> 00:50:08,180
Ooh.

1932
00:50:08,180 --> 00:50:08,661
Oh Hey.

1933
00:50:08,661 --> 00:50:09,910
I caught him with that left.

1934
00:50:14,780 --> 00:50:15,471
I mean there's a,

1935
00:50:15,471 --> 00:50:20,360
there's a big difference between
guys on Shit and not on shit.

1936
00:50:20,361 --> 00:50:20,630
Yes.

1937
00:50:20,630 --> 00:50:23,480
I mean anybody who's doing help,

1938
00:50:23,540 --> 00:50:24,560
you're crazy.

1939
00:50:24,830 --> 00:50:25,730
Go fight Vietor

1940
00:50:27,530 --> 00:50:30,470
go fight DRTV door or shut the fuck up.

1941
00:50:30,620 --> 00:50:32,030
Because of course they help.

1942
00:50:32,090 --> 00:50:33,590
They help in a giant way.

1943
00:50:35,060 --> 00:50:36,530
Anybody who tells you differently is just,

1944
00:50:36,950 --> 00:50:40,460
they're either lying to themselves
or they're on fucking steroids too.

1945
00:50:41,060 --> 00:50:42,140
Because here's the thing,

1946
00:50:42,320 --> 00:50:46,280
there's guys that are mentally strong
and durable and they're warriors and

1947
00:50:46,281 --> 00:50:47,120
they're on steroids.

1948
00:50:47,300 --> 00:50:49,190
Like the idea that you can have either or,

1949
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:52,730
you know like either you have a guy
who was tough or you have a cheater.

1950
00:50:52,750 --> 00:50:53,030
No,

1951
00:50:53,030 --> 00:50:54,290
you have tough cheaters.

1952
00:50:55,370 --> 00:50:56,390
Like those are real,

1953
00:50:57,020 --> 00:50:58,580
there's really tough cheaters.

1954
00:50:58,840 --> 00:50:59,600
Like,

1955
00:50:59,600 --> 00:51:01,790
especially if they know that
everybody else is cheating.

1956
00:51:02,630 --> 00:51:02,811
Yeah.

1957
00:51:02,811 --> 00:51:03,680
They'll cheat too.

1958
00:51:04,640 --> 00:51:05,600
And I think that's,

1959
00:51:05,630 --> 00:51:06,463
you know,

1960
00:51:06,560 --> 00:51:07,850
I mean when you see me,

1961
00:51:07,851 --> 00:51:08,541
no disrespect,

1962
00:51:08,541 --> 00:51:13,541
but when you see cro cop come back and
win rise and we're in the horizon back in

1963
00:51:14,151 --> 00:51:15,410
Japan at 40,

1964
00:51:15,411 --> 00:51:16,221
whatever he was,

1965
00:51:16,221 --> 00:51:17,900
I think he was 43 or 44.

1966
00:51:18,110 --> 00:51:19,950
Oh four nine two how will he,

1967
00:51:19,970 --> 00:51:24,970
his legs are back to being just fucking
34 inches shredded six pack look in huge

1968
00:51:26,990 --> 00:51:29,090
looking to be about two 35 to 40.

1969
00:51:29,091 --> 00:51:29,924
Again,

1970
00:51:30,320 --> 00:51:33,590
cracking dudes beat
the fuck out of Kim Mo.

1971
00:51:33,680 --> 00:51:33,891
Yeah.

1972
00:51:33,891 --> 00:51:35,030
King King Mo was,

1973
00:51:35,031 --> 00:51:37,040
I mean that was King Moses.

1974
00:51:37,041 --> 00:51:38,690
Serious fighter man.

1975
00:51:38,691 --> 00:51:41,330
He's a tough guy and he
fucking crumpled him.

1976
00:51:41,810 --> 00:51:42,643
Yeah.

1977
00:51:42,710 --> 00:51:47,630
And just shucked off the wrestling
and caught him with some hard strikes

1978
00:51:50,240 --> 00:51:50,720
and he's uh,

1979
00:51:50,720 --> 00:51:52,340
he's just such a hard kicker to that.

1980
00:51:52,341 --> 00:51:54,020
If you just take one of those in the arms,

1981
00:51:54,440 --> 00:51:55,540
I mean your,

1982
00:51:55,640 --> 00:51:58,190
your life level,

1983
00:51:58,191 --> 00:51:59,120
like in a video game,

1984
00:51:59,630 --> 00:52:03,410
he kicks you so head down it
changes your whole outlook on life.

1985
00:52:03,590 --> 00:52:05,410
One kick to the arms and you're like,

1986
00:52:05,530 --> 00:52:06,363
oh,

1987
00:52:06,830 --> 00:52:07,311
you just,

1988
00:52:07,311 --> 00:52:07,980
you just start going,

1989
00:52:07,980 --> 00:52:08,813
what am I doing?

1990
00:52:09,220 --> 00:52:12,380
Like Zig when I should have zagged.

1991
00:52:13,250 --> 00:52:14,480
And that fucking thing catches me.

1992
00:52:14,720 --> 00:52:15,553
Yeah.

1993
00:52:15,620 --> 00:52:15,741
Yeah.

1994
00:52:15,741 --> 00:52:16,790
These are coming in my face,

1995
00:52:16,820 --> 00:52:17,653
but wait a second.

1996
00:52:18,290 --> 00:52:19,280
So let me ask you this,

1997
00:52:19,281 --> 00:52:19,670
Ian,

1998
00:52:19,670 --> 00:52:22,220
now that you've gone
through these five fights,

1999
00:52:22,221 --> 00:52:23,054
they did Ooh,

2000
00:52:23,090 --> 00:52:25,490
beautiful leg kick and returned.

2001
00:52:26,630 --> 00:52:27,463
But people,

2002
00:52:27,500 --> 00:52:28,101
it's interesting,

2003
00:52:28,101 --> 00:52:28,251
you know,

2004
00:52:28,251 --> 00:52:31,640
you talked to Maureen Thai
guys and they'll tell you
don't ever try to return a

2005
00:52:31,641 --> 00:52:33,520
leg kick after someone
throws a light kick,

2006
00:52:34,450 --> 00:52:36,470
cause they're gonna know you're going
to do it and they're gonna check you

2007
00:52:36,471 --> 00:52:37,850
because it's human instinct.

2008
00:52:37,870 --> 00:52:38,300
Yeah.

2009
00:52:38,300 --> 00:52:40,480
But in MMA kind of works sometimes.

2010
00:52:41,720 --> 00:52:45,500
What now you're dealing
with five fights in a row.

2011
00:52:45,501 --> 00:52:46,220
That didn't,

2012
00:52:46,220 --> 00:52:46,820
didn't happen.

2013
00:52:46,820 --> 00:52:47,590
Are you?

2014
00:52:47,590 --> 00:52:49,190
You starting to think like,

2015
00:52:49,191 --> 00:52:50,024
Hey,

2016
00:52:50,150 --> 00:52:51,650
maybe I'm not going to do this anymore.

2017
00:52:52,910 --> 00:52:54,380
Of course you must be right.

2018
00:52:54,410 --> 00:52:54,920
Yeah.

2019
00:52:54,920 --> 00:52:55,310
And I mean,

2020
00:52:55,310 --> 00:52:56,180
I thought about,

2021
00:52:56,181 --> 00:53:00,140
I thought about that before
when I signed a fight,

2022
00:53:00,260 --> 00:53:02,240
this most recent fight against Scoggins.

2023
00:53:02,570 --> 00:53:03,200
Um,

2024
00:53:03,200 --> 00:53:04,280
I literally was like,

2025
00:53:04,370 --> 00:53:06,950
I laughed as I was
signing it and I was like,

2026
00:53:06,951 --> 00:53:08,960
I'm not gonna my arm wasn't working.

2027
00:53:09,230 --> 00:53:09,501
I'm like,

2028
00:53:09,501 --> 00:53:09,711
sure,

2029
00:53:09,711 --> 00:53:10,070
whatever.

2030
00:53:10,070 --> 00:53:10,260
Sure.

2031
00:53:10,260 --> 00:53:10,431
I'll,

2032
00:53:10,431 --> 00:53:11,150
I'll take a fight.

2033
00:53:11,150 --> 00:53:11,931
What arm wasn't working?

2034
00:53:11,931 --> 00:53:13,400
My right one after my surgeries.

2035
00:53:13,670 --> 00:53:15,390
You shoulder serve after
my shoulder surgery.

2036
00:53:15,391 --> 00:53:17,030
So if people don't know,

2037
00:53:17,031 --> 00:53:19,460
I've had three surgeries on my hand,

2038
00:53:19,520 --> 00:53:21,260
I fractured dislocation on my elbow.

2039
00:53:21,350 --> 00:53:21,800
Show your,

2040
00:53:21,800 --> 00:53:23,900
show you the fist that
you're capable of making.

2041
00:53:24,350 --> 00:53:25,080
And that's my,

2042
00:53:25,080 --> 00:53:25,913
that's my fist.

2043
00:53:25,920 --> 00:53:26,610
Yeah,

2044
00:53:26,610 --> 00:53:28,680
it expands to that and close to that.

2045
00:53:28,681 --> 00:53:29,850
So I get to beat people up with this,

2046
00:53:30,090 --> 00:53:32,340
which is real cool because when you
spot have a good day of sparring,

2047
00:53:32,341 --> 00:53:33,450
it just nice and swollen.

2048
00:53:33,900 --> 00:53:34,400
Um,

2049
00:53:34,400 --> 00:53:35,233
the joking,

2050
00:53:35,580 --> 00:53:36,030
joking,

2051
00:53:36,030 --> 00:53:36,863
joking,

2052
00:53:37,130 --> 00:53:38,220
the people only listen to us.

2053
00:53:38,250 --> 00:53:41,210
Ian Can't totally close his
hand and his index finger,

2054
00:53:41,700 --> 00:53:43,590
his index finger protrudes.

2055
00:53:43,830 --> 00:53:45,240
So like if you punch someone wrong,

2056
00:53:45,241 --> 00:53:46,330
I'd probably just re breaks.

2057
00:53:46,460 --> 00:53:47,293
Yeah.

2058
00:53:47,560 --> 00:53:48,360
Um,

2059
00:53:48,360 --> 00:53:49,111
and you can't really,

2060
00:53:49,111 --> 00:53:49,381
I mean,

2061
00:53:49,381 --> 00:53:51,510
can you actually punched
them with your knuckle?

2062
00:53:52,350 --> 00:53:52,860
No.

2063
00:53:52,860 --> 00:53:54,060
How do they let you fight like that?

2064
00:53:54,100 --> 00:53:54,351
I ran,

2065
00:53:54,351 --> 00:53:54,451
I'm,

2066
00:53:54,451 --> 00:53:55,320
everything's corked.

2067
00:53:55,350 --> 00:53:59,800
I just figured it out and
a lot of elbows and I,

2068
00:54:00,090 --> 00:54:00,581
I mean I,

2069
00:54:00,581 --> 00:54:00,681
I,

2070
00:54:00,681 --> 00:54:02,400
it's why I've been kicking for most of my,

2071
00:54:02,401 --> 00:54:02,790
you know,

2072
00:54:02,790 --> 00:54:03,623
for the last,

2073
00:54:03,630 --> 00:54:07,050
how many years has been three years cause
my hand and then I ended up having my,

2074
00:54:07,051 --> 00:54:07,500
um,

2075
00:54:07,500 --> 00:54:08,370
my shoulder we done,

2076
00:54:08,380 --> 00:54:12,240
I had a fully torn bicep tendon to labral
tears in the fully torn rotator cuffs

2077
00:54:12,241 --> 00:54:13,140
and then there's that Jamie.

2078
00:54:14,760 --> 00:54:15,480
Oh,

2079
00:54:15,480 --> 00:54:19,200
so that's my right arm
and I just wasn't working.

2080
00:54:19,201 --> 00:54:20,034
And then finally,

2081
00:54:20,170 --> 00:54:20,530
uh,

2082
00:54:20,530 --> 00:54:21,540
I asked my doctor,

2083
00:54:21,541 --> 00:54:21,751
I'm like,

2084
00:54:21,751 --> 00:54:23,570
I want to get another Mri because I have,

2085
00:54:23,590 --> 00:54:24,690
I just signed for a fight.

2086
00:54:25,050 --> 00:54:26,430
So we got an MRI and he's like,

2087
00:54:26,431 --> 00:54:26,791
okay,

2088
00:54:26,791 --> 00:54:27,451
you want the good news?

2089
00:54:27,451 --> 00:54:27,631
Yes.

2090
00:54:27,631 --> 00:54:27,841
He's like,

2091
00:54:27,841 --> 00:54:28,680
stop being a bitch.

2092
00:54:28,740 --> 00:54:28,921
He's like,

2093
00:54:28,921 --> 00:54:29,754
you want to fight?

2094
00:54:30,420 --> 00:54:31,080
He's like,

2095
00:54:31,080 --> 00:54:32,150
just fucking fight through it.

2096
00:54:32,200 --> 00:54:32,401
He's like,

2097
00:54:32,401 --> 00:54:32,911
it's going to hurt,

2098
00:54:32,911 --> 00:54:33,960
but your shoulder's fine.

2099
00:54:34,400 --> 00:54:35,910
[inaudible] causing the pain.

2100
00:54:36,240 --> 00:54:40,320
It was just from all the scar tissue
and all the impingements I'm whatever.

2101
00:54:40,410 --> 00:54:42,120
Do you ever hang buddy shoulders?

2102
00:54:42,190 --> 00:54:42,750
They were hanged.

2103
00:54:42,750 --> 00:54:43,583
How often you do that?

2104
00:54:43,860 --> 00:54:44,693
Not often enough.

2105
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:45,833
I do it every day.

2106
00:54:46,400 --> 00:54:46,710
I need,

2107
00:54:46,710 --> 00:54:49,710
I need to get one from my house off for
30 seconds and I worked my way up to two

2108
00:54:49,711 --> 00:54:50,544
minutes.

2109
00:54:50,730 --> 00:54:51,180
Nice.

2110
00:54:51,180 --> 00:54:52,690
And Yeah,

2111
00:54:52,980 --> 00:54:54,220
30 seconds of my warmup.

2112
00:54:54,850 --> 00:54:55,201
You know,

2113
00:54:55,201 --> 00:54:55,681
I warm up,

2114
00:54:55,681 --> 00:54:56,880
I hold for 30 seconds,

2115
00:54:56,910 --> 00:54:57,511
but a,

2116
00:54:57,511 --> 00:54:59,820
I get to the point where I'm holding
them hanging for two minutes.

2117
00:55:00,570 --> 00:55:01,403
Nice.

2118
00:55:01,710 --> 00:55:03,630
I've been doing the shit
out of my hands too.

2119
00:55:03,670 --> 00:55:06,180
Got To chalk up one hands
or your elbows complete.

2120
00:55:06,181 --> 00:55:07,590
Locked debt is locked.

2121
00:55:07,710 --> 00:55:09,000
Like my hands gripped.

2122
00:55:09,001 --> 00:55:09,511
I grip,

2123
00:55:09,511 --> 00:55:12,480
I death grip that bar but
thumbs out like you know,

2124
00:55:12,830 --> 00:55:15,150
Jujitsu style and
they're actually hanging,

2125
00:55:15,151 --> 00:55:15,600
hanging.

2126
00:55:15,600 --> 00:55:16,980
There's no pull up at all.

2127
00:55:17,030 --> 00:55:17,250
No,

2128
00:55:17,250 --> 00:55:18,083
no portal.

2129
00:55:18,170 --> 00:55:21,030
Just total locked arms out
and I feel stuff loosening.

2130
00:55:21,031 --> 00:55:21,141
Yeah.

2131
00:55:21,141 --> 00:55:24,390
You feel my shoulders pull up if
you do it pop two minutes a day,

2132
00:55:24,400 --> 00:55:24,811
whatever.

2133
00:55:24,811 --> 00:55:25,980
Good for your shoulders man.

2134
00:55:25,981 --> 00:55:26,181
It's,

2135
00:55:26,181 --> 00:55:29,640
it's supposed to be one of
the most amazing things for
rehabilitating shoulders

2136
00:55:29,970 --> 00:55:31,740
because seconds and then two minutes,

2137
00:55:31,770 --> 00:55:32,880
well I worked my way up to 30,

2138
00:55:33,020 --> 00:55:37,260
I'd go 30 seconds and I'll do another
set of 30 seconds and then I'll do a

2139
00:55:37,260 --> 00:55:39,630
minute and then I'll do two
minutes for like my final one.

2140
00:55:39,660 --> 00:55:41,370
And then I do Chin ups and I do chin ups.

2141
00:55:41,371 --> 00:55:44,030
Now lately I've been doing heavy chin,

2142
00:55:44,160 --> 00:55:47,500
so instead of just regular checkups now
do chin ups with a 70 pound kettle bell

2143
00:55:47,501 --> 00:55:48,360
strapped to my waist.

2144
00:55:48,630 --> 00:55:50,090
I put one of those bars,

2145
00:55:50,110 --> 00:55:50,310
you know,

2146
00:55:50,310 --> 00:55:50,781
those uh,

2147
00:55:50,781 --> 00:55:51,180
weight,

2148
00:55:51,180 --> 00:55:52,013
those vests,

2149
00:55:52,040 --> 00:55:53,820
not best belts with the chain,

2150
00:55:53,850 --> 00:55:54,031
you know,

2151
00:55:54,031 --> 00:55:54,960
like for depths and shit.

2152
00:55:55,140 --> 00:55:57,960
And I put a kettle bell in there
and I'll do chin ups with 70 pounds.

2153
00:55:58,020 --> 00:55:59,040
How many can you do?

2154
00:55:59,070 --> 00:55:59,790
Five.

2155
00:55:59,790 --> 00:56:01,500
Holy Jesus.

2156
00:56:01,790 --> 00:56:02,623
Yeah.

2157
00:56:02,970 --> 00:56:03,620
What?

2158
00:56:03,620 --> 00:56:04,453
No,

2159
00:56:04,740 --> 00:56:05,071
that's not,

2160
00:56:05,071 --> 00:56:05,580
that's true.

2161
00:56:05,580 --> 00:56:06,413
It's not that bad.

2162
00:56:06,690 --> 00:56:07,441
There's some lucky,

2163
00:56:07,441 --> 00:56:08,274
it's okay.

2164
00:56:08,700 --> 00:56:09,750
Five is not a lot.

2165
00:56:09,780 --> 00:56:11,310
I could barely handle my own weight.

2166
00:56:11,430 --> 00:56:12,510
How much I may chat ops.

2167
00:56:12,511 --> 00:56:14,520
Can you do a when I'm in shape?

2168
00:56:14,660 --> 00:56:15,493
Yeah,

2169
00:56:17,010 --> 00:56:18,390
probably when I'm in shape.

2170
00:56:19,170 --> 00:56:20,370
1213,

2171
00:56:20,910 --> 00:56:22,140
just straight strict.

2172
00:56:22,141 --> 00:56:22,831
All the way down.

2173
00:56:22,831 --> 00:56:23,664
All the back up.

2174
00:56:24,160 --> 00:56:25,570
You're not locked out though.

2175
00:56:25,600 --> 00:56:28,360
I can do 16 chin ups all the way down,

2176
00:56:28,630 --> 00:56:29,530
all the way back up,

2177
00:56:29,560 --> 00:56:30,251
all the way down,

2178
00:56:30,251 --> 00:56:31,120
all the way back up,

2179
00:56:31,121 --> 00:56:32,620
completely locked arms.

2180
00:56:32,800 --> 00:56:34,540
And then all the way chin over the bar.

2181
00:56:34,720 --> 00:56:38,170
I can do 16 I can do 24
if I just go like this.

2182
00:56:39,880 --> 00:56:42,820
You know that shit that people do
when they say I do 24 Chin ups.

2183
00:56:42,850 --> 00:56:45,160
Oh I can too if you do them that way.

2184
00:56:45,430 --> 00:56:46,840
But if you go all the way down,

2185
00:56:46,880 --> 00:56:48,870
sometimes they'll wait a bat,

2186
00:56:49,180 --> 00:56:50,630
but also want to do it that way.

2187
00:56:50,740 --> 00:56:51,461
When I'm doing it,

2188
00:56:51,461 --> 00:56:53,410
I'm not doing it to show
how many chin ups I can do.

2189
00:56:53,411 --> 00:56:54,730
So when I do the negatives,

2190
00:56:54,731 --> 00:56:56,890
my negatives are twice
as long as my positives.

2191
00:56:57,160 --> 00:57:01,840
And sometimes I fuck around and do real
slow negatives for Hay is not really an

2192
00:57:01,841 --> 00:57:02,680
Armbar guy,

2193
00:57:02,770 --> 00:57:03,760
but he's got the back.

2194
00:57:04,120 --> 00:57:05,470
I thought he was gonna slide over for it.

2195
00:57:06,650 --> 00:57:07,690
Now he's riding the guy,

2196
00:57:07,691 --> 00:57:08,200
right?

2197
00:57:08,200 --> 00:57:09,033
Yeah.

2198
00:57:09,040 --> 00:57:09,873
Um,

2199
00:57:10,600 --> 00:57:12,460
but he's got decent Jujitsu.

2200
00:57:12,890 --> 00:57:14,410
I like how he's staying close to him.

2201
00:57:14,411 --> 00:57:15,580
He's squeezing the shit out of him.

2202
00:57:16,090 --> 00:57:16,300
Oh,

2203
00:57:16,300 --> 00:57:16,970
lost it.

2204
00:57:16,970 --> 00:57:17,860
Good defense.

2205
00:57:17,950 --> 00:57:18,783
Yeah.

2206
00:57:18,880 --> 00:57:19,960
That's grease right there.

2207
00:57:21,450 --> 00:57:22,283
You're right.

2208
00:57:22,460 --> 00:57:22,921
See,

2209
00:57:22,921 --> 00:57:23,754
I was going to say,

2210
00:57:24,660 --> 00:57:24,860
yeah,

2211
00:57:24,860 --> 00:57:26,470
he gets ups right off that guy.

2212
00:57:26,471 --> 00:57:27,910
Go like this and then your slider.

2213
00:57:27,911 --> 00:57:31,870
And there's no need to put Vaseline over
their eyes cause they grapple and get

2214
00:57:31,871 --> 00:57:32,500
in the way.

2215
00:57:32,500 --> 00:57:33,333
It's true.

2216
00:57:33,550 --> 00:57:33,821
I mean,

2217
00:57:33,821 --> 00:57:35,350
it definitely becomes a factor in a fight.

2218
00:57:35,351 --> 00:57:36,400
There's no doubt about it.

2219
00:57:36,430 --> 00:57:36,851
Stop.

2220
00:57:36,851 --> 00:57:38,650
Put the Vaseline on the eyes.

2221
00:57:38,860 --> 00:57:39,250
Yeah.

2222
00:57:39,250 --> 00:57:40,510
That grease gets everywhere.

2223
00:57:40,540 --> 00:57:41,540
It fucks up the ground.

2224
00:57:41,570 --> 00:57:42,880
We'll get so slippery.

2225
00:57:43,180 --> 00:57:43,421
Well,

2226
00:57:43,421 --> 00:57:46,330
it's one of those things that they have
to kind of do to stop bleeding though.

2227
00:57:46,660 --> 00:57:47,590
If there is a cut,

2228
00:57:47,620 --> 00:57:48,340
they have to do it.

2229
00:57:48,340 --> 00:57:49,900
But they do it even when there's no cut.

2230
00:57:50,400 --> 00:57:50,650
Yeah.

2231
00:57:50,650 --> 00:57:51,760
They should eliminate that.

2232
00:57:51,880 --> 00:57:52,661
They don't let the,

2233
00:57:52,661 --> 00:57:53,041
uh,

2234
00:57:53,041 --> 00:57:54,490
the corner do it anymore.

2235
00:57:54,640 --> 00:57:55,610
Now it's a,

2236
00:57:55,670 --> 00:57:56,530
it's gotta be a come in.

2237
00:57:56,590 --> 00:57:57,423
Yeah.

2238
00:57:57,490 --> 00:58:02,490
Do you remember when Pat Miletich fought
Carlos Newton and Jeremy Horn was in

2239
00:58:04,301 --> 00:58:06,220
the corner and he even jokes about like,

2240
00:58:06,221 --> 00:58:07,540
he doesn't even know why he did it.

2241
00:58:07,900 --> 00:58:11,020
He was like putting
Vaseline on Pat's neck.

2242
00:58:11,950 --> 00:58:12,760
I don't know why.

2243
00:58:12,760 --> 00:58:13,031
Yeah.

2244
00:58:13,031 --> 00:58:13,750
He's like,

2245
00:58:13,750 --> 00:58:14,110
he's like,

2246
00:58:14,110 --> 00:58:15,470
I don't even know what
the fuck I was doing.

2247
00:58:15,471 --> 00:58:16,304
And he's like,

2248
00:58:16,490 --> 00:58:17,720
I can just massaging of him.

2249
00:58:17,910 --> 00:58:18,350
He goes,

2250
00:58:18,350 --> 00:58:18,821
he's like,

2251
00:58:18,821 --> 00:58:19,960
I don't even know why I was doing it.

2252
00:58:19,961 --> 00:58:20,800
And then anyway,

2253
00:58:20,860 --> 00:58:24,910
it turned out to fuck him because Carlos
Newton got him in that bull dog choker

2254
00:58:24,911 --> 00:58:27,550
and just whip slipped
right under the chin.

2255
00:58:27,710 --> 00:58:28,270
You remember that?

2256
00:58:28,270 --> 00:58:28,960
Yes.

2257
00:58:28,960 --> 00:58:32,320
Carlos got Pat Miletich and one of the
first bulldog chokes we ever saw in the

2258
00:58:32,321 --> 00:58:33,154
UFC.

2259
00:58:33,220 --> 00:58:36,340
It's only been like three bill dog
chokes and the UFC is actually,

2260
00:58:36,500 --> 00:58:37,050
um,

2261
00:58:37,050 --> 00:58:37,700
at lunch.

2262
00:58:37,700 --> 00:58:38,533
Um,

2263
00:58:38,650 --> 00:58:41,200
Ashley Evan Smith got choked
out by Raquel Pennington.

2264
00:58:41,240 --> 00:58:42,700
That was a fucking wild one.

2265
00:58:42,701 --> 00:58:43,534
Raquel Pennington.

2266
00:58:43,960 --> 00:58:45,100
Raquel Pennington is one,

2267
00:58:45,101 --> 00:58:48,670
two UFC within one second
where I was screaming so loud,

2268
00:58:48,671 --> 00:58:49,301
I was blown out.

2269
00:58:49,301 --> 00:58:50,230
People's ear drums like,

2270
00:58:50,410 --> 00:58:51,243
oh,

2271
00:58:51,450 --> 00:58:52,750
I'm going to look like
the one with Ashley.

2272
00:58:52,751 --> 00:58:55,630
Evan Smith though was crazy because there
was blood everywhere and she gets her

2273
00:58:55,631 --> 00:58:58,480
in the bulldog choke and she's
got her face down and then she,

2274
00:58:58,730 --> 00:59:00,870
it's like the end of
the fight fucking thing.

2275
00:59:00,900 --> 00:59:01,750
I let her off and she's out.

2276
00:59:01,770 --> 00:59:02,710
Colon is blood everywhere.

2277
00:59:02,711 --> 00:59:03,544
It was a chaos.

2278
00:59:04,030 --> 00:59:04,780
And um,

2279
00:59:04,780 --> 00:59:06,130
the other one was Chris Lights out.

2280
00:59:06,160 --> 00:59:08,940
Lidell against Dki.

2281
00:59:09,910 --> 00:59:10,900
He got,

2282
00:59:11,260 --> 00:59:12,280
he got to have a tight

2283
00:59:14,120 --> 00:59:16,590
that head out hair grease.

2284
00:59:16,930 --> 00:59:17,710
Now how much,

2285
00:59:17,710 --> 00:59:19,360
how much grease can you
get in those dreads?

2286
00:59:19,361 --> 00:59:19,570
Yeah.

2287
00:59:19,570 --> 00:59:20,403
How about that?

2288
00:59:20,520 --> 00:59:20,840
Huh?

2289
00:59:20,840 --> 00:59:21,770
Oh,

2290
00:59:21,771 --> 00:59:22,100
ground

2291
00:59:22,100 --> 00:59:22,831
and pound there.

2292
00:59:22,831 --> 00:59:23,330
Doro.

2293
00:59:23,330 --> 00:59:24,320
He's a tough guy.

2294
00:59:24,650 --> 00:59:25,011
Lies.

2295
00:59:25,011 --> 00:59:25,844
Theodora

2296
00:59:28,590 --> 00:59:29,270
um,

2297
00:59:29,270 --> 00:59:29,931
but yeah,

2298
00:59:29,931 --> 00:59:31,730
so that was the other bulldog choke.

2299
00:59:32,660 --> 00:59:34,970
There's been three that I could think of.

2300
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:37,730
Maybe there's been another one that I
forgot or maybe I didn't call the fight.

2301
00:59:38,450 --> 00:59:39,620
That's a rare move though.

2302
00:59:40,880 --> 00:59:41,720
But it's one of those things,

2303
00:59:41,721 --> 00:59:41,871
man,

2304
00:59:41,871 --> 00:59:44,690
if you're in front and you're sitting
out and you've got it locked in,

2305
00:59:44,691 --> 00:59:46,580
you've got someone's neck
trapped on your forum.

2306
00:59:46,790 --> 00:59:47,031
Ooh,

2307
00:59:47,031 --> 00:59:47,900
that's a good chuck.

2308
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:50,030
It's very hard to,

2309
00:59:50,510 --> 00:59:53,180
very hard to get out of that
because you're a good move Eddie,

2310
00:59:53,181 --> 00:59:54,014
to get out of that.

2311
00:59:54,440 --> 00:59:57,620
If someone's got it locked in and they're
sitting out and they really got that

2312
00:59:57,621 --> 01:00:00,500
fucking head in there and you're back
this way and like you're on your knees

2313
01:00:00,760 --> 01:00:02,270
like a lot of guys who seem to get it.

2314
01:00:03,350 --> 01:00:04,610
What the fuck do you do to get out?

2315
01:00:04,640 --> 01:00:07,010
I mean obviously move forward
and try to take the back.

2316
01:00:09,610 --> 01:00:09,980
Oh,

2317
01:00:09,980 --> 01:00:13,160
well I'd have to get down on the mats
and you'd have to show me exactly what a

2318
01:00:13,170 --> 01:00:14,210
hard show to get out of.

2319
01:00:14,230 --> 01:00:15,450
It's hard to uh,

2320
01:00:16,570 --> 01:00:18,070
explain with words.

2321
01:00:18,520 --> 01:00:19,353
Hmm.

2322
01:00:20,030 --> 01:00:21,860
You know what I've been
seeing guys do too,

2323
01:00:22,070 --> 01:00:23,540
I've been seeing guys get like,

2324
01:00:23,570 --> 01:00:28,430
get into like a guillotine position
from the back and lean forward on a dude

2325
01:00:28,760 --> 01:00:30,470
like getting like a gay teen.

2326
01:00:30,740 --> 01:00:32,120
Like he'd do like this,

2327
01:00:32,210 --> 01:00:35,570
but they've getting it from behind
and leaning forward on a guy.

2328
01:00:36,170 --> 01:00:38,420
I saw somebody do that
recently where he didn't,

2329
01:00:38,510 --> 01:00:38,991
he didn't,

2330
01:00:38,991 --> 01:00:40,700
it was like from a north south position.

2331
01:00:40,940 --> 01:00:42,070
He didn't have hooks in.

2332
01:00:42,260 --> 01:00:43,093
He caught like,

2333
01:00:43,160 --> 01:00:47,480
like a gay teen from behind and had his
head trapped by his shoulder and lean

2334
01:00:47,481 --> 01:00:47,811
forward.

2335
01:00:47,811 --> 01:00:50,360
And I was like neck cranking him
and choking him at the same time.

2336
01:00:50,361 --> 01:00:51,770
It looked fucking nasty.

2337
01:00:52,370 --> 01:00:54,740
It's like you see a thousand
fights and he'd say,

2338
01:00:54,741 --> 01:00:55,011
well,

2339
01:00:55,011 --> 01:00:56,240
I pretty much never see everything.

2340
01:00:56,480 --> 01:00:58,370
And then someone comes
up your shit and you go,

2341
01:00:58,371 --> 01:00:59,270
Whoa,

2342
01:00:59,570 --> 01:01:00,470
let me see that again.

2343
01:01:00,471 --> 01:01:01,304
Whoa.

2344
01:01:01,310 --> 01:01:02,210
I got put in a,

2345
01:01:02,470 --> 01:01:02,960
uh,

2346
01:01:02,960 --> 01:01:05,060
just a regular school
yard chuck wants and it,

2347
01:01:05,190 --> 01:01:05,840
uh,

2348
01:01:05,840 --> 01:01:07,460
it fucked me up,

2349
01:01:07,461 --> 01:01:08,230
man.

2350
01:01:08,230 --> 01:01:08,710
I,

2351
01:01:08,710 --> 01:01:09,140
I,

2352
01:01:09,140 --> 01:01:12,620
I did little league baseball and I sucked.

2353
01:01:12,621 --> 01:01:14,720
I always led the league and strike outs.

2354
01:01:15,440 --> 01:01:16,273
I was terrible.

2355
01:01:16,940 --> 01:01:17,631
I was terrible.

2356
01:01:17,631 --> 01:01:18,120
I was a,

2357
01:01:18,120 --> 01:01:20,240
but I had my moments.

2358
01:01:20,330 --> 01:01:24,890
I remember like I connected once and it
was fucking dead center and they caught

2359
01:01:24,891 --> 01:01:25,011
it.

2360
01:01:25,011 --> 01:01:25,580
And was it,

2361
01:01:25,580 --> 01:01:27,790
that was my glory as I hit like a,

2362
01:01:28,130 --> 01:01:29,720
a ball deep into center field.

2363
01:01:29,721 --> 01:01:30,501
It was caught though,

2364
01:01:30,501 --> 01:01:31,520
but at least I hit it.

2365
01:01:32,240 --> 01:01:34,280
I would strike the fuck out.

2366
01:01:35,780 --> 01:01:38,150
But I played catcher and um,

2367
01:01:38,270 --> 01:01:39,070
so he didn't have to move.

2368
01:01:39,070 --> 01:01:39,651
I sucked.

2369
01:01:39,651 --> 01:01:42,260
So it was like ages eight to 12.

2370
01:01:42,480 --> 01:01:42,701
Right.

2371
01:01:42,701 --> 01:01:44,600
So there's eight year olds
and then there's 12 year olds.

2372
01:01:44,840 --> 01:01:45,673
I sucked.

2373
01:01:45,920 --> 01:01:47,300
But I was born in,

2374
01:01:47,301 --> 01:01:47,571
in a,

2375
01:01:47,571 --> 01:01:49,760
in a month where I made the costs.

2376
01:01:49,930 --> 01:01:54,930
I was an old dude now and I could
still play little league and they go,

2377
01:01:54,951 --> 01:01:56,210
you want to play another year?

2378
01:01:56,540 --> 01:01:57,800
And I didn't,

2379
01:01:57,920 --> 01:01:59,390
I was tired of being humiliated,

2380
01:01:59,420 --> 01:02:01,100
but I was older than most of the guys.

2381
01:02:01,430 --> 01:02:05,000
So even though I shocked how was like two,

2382
01:02:05,001 --> 01:02:07,220
three years older than most
of the guys on the team.

2383
01:02:07,221 --> 01:02:08,350
So they wanted me to be the,

2384
01:02:08,480 --> 01:02:11,930
like the captain and Oh man,

2385
01:02:11,931 --> 01:02:12,860
I was such,

2386
01:02:12,950 --> 01:02:14,240
I so didn't want to do it.

2387
01:02:14,270 --> 01:02:16,660
I was being a total debugged.

2388
01:02:16,760 --> 01:02:17,593
Everybody,

2389
01:02:17,600 --> 01:02:21,720
everybody on the team and
our right fielder had a
plastic glove and I would make

2390
01:02:21,721 --> 01:02:22,800
fun of his plastic glove.

2391
01:02:22,801 --> 01:02:24,180
I was such an asshole.

2392
01:02:24,720 --> 01:02:26,040
Why didn't make fun of his glove?

2393
01:02:26,130 --> 01:02:28,860
I was just an asshole
because I was an older,

2394
01:02:29,160 --> 01:02:29,600
an old,

2395
01:02:29,600 --> 01:02:31,470
I was the older of this team.

2396
01:02:31,710 --> 01:02:31,981
We are,

2397
01:02:31,981 --> 01:02:32,300
I mean,

2398
01:02:32,300 --> 01:02:33,031
I'm hanging out,

2399
01:02:33,031 --> 01:02:36,270
forced to be hanging out with eight
year olds and nine year olds and I'm 12,

2400
01:02:36,560 --> 01:02:36,810
you know,

2401
01:02:36,810 --> 01:02:37,680
and I don't want to be here,

2402
01:02:37,681 --> 01:02:40,650
but the coaches want to be there because
they thought I had leadership skills,

2403
01:02:40,651 --> 01:02:41,640
but I still sucked.

2404
01:02:41,940 --> 01:02:43,260
I still couldn't hit anything.

2405
01:02:43,261 --> 01:02:43,980
I still,

2406
01:02:43,980 --> 01:02:45,360
I couldn't connect ever.

2407
01:02:45,361 --> 01:02:46,680
I was just always striking out.

2408
01:02:47,280 --> 01:02:48,113
And um,

2409
01:02:48,180 --> 01:02:49,013
but um,

2410
01:02:49,080 --> 01:02:52,050
they had me pitching and shit
just cause I was older than them.

2411
01:02:52,260 --> 01:02:53,430
I was a terrible picture.

2412
01:02:53,700 --> 01:02:54,480
But um,

2413
01:02:54,480 --> 01:02:55,313
anyways,

2414
01:02:55,350 --> 01:02:57,870
I was taught a Raphael
who had the plastic glove.

2415
01:02:57,871 --> 01:03:01,440
We were all huddled together after
practice and I was talking shit on him,

2416
01:03:01,650 --> 01:03:06,650
on his plastic glove and he just got
me in a headlock dude and just held me

2417
01:03:06,721 --> 01:03:07,800
there and I didn't know what to do.

2418
01:03:07,801 --> 01:03:09,240
And he fucking used all his,

2419
01:03:09,450 --> 01:03:10,560
his hate towards me.

2420
01:03:10,561 --> 01:03:12,180
He squeezed my motherfucking head.

2421
01:03:12,420 --> 01:03:16,440
This guy hated the shit out of
me and I couldn't do anything.

2422
01:03:16,441 --> 01:03:17,850
I had no more.

2423
01:03:17,910 --> 01:03:21,330
I was 12 years old and in front
of the whole baseball team,

2424
01:03:21,540 --> 01:03:24,890
he finally was the one that
snapped because I was a dick.

2425
01:03:24,900 --> 01:03:27,930
To everybody and I was just
like the older kid and I,

2426
01:03:27,931 --> 01:03:28,440
you know,

2427
01:03:28,440 --> 01:03:32,130
my ego was exploding because I'm the
older kid and I'm the captain of the team

2428
01:03:32,131 --> 01:03:33,570
even though I suck.

2429
01:03:33,570 --> 01:03:34,403
Yeah.

2430
01:03:34,470 --> 01:03:35,303
Um,

2431
01:03:35,370 --> 01:03:36,460
I just was that,

2432
01:03:36,780 --> 01:03:37,740
I learned my lesson,

2433
01:03:37,741 --> 01:03:38,160
man.

2434
01:03:38,160 --> 01:03:39,380
I learned my lesson because he put,

2435
01:03:39,630 --> 01:03:39,870
he,

2436
01:03:39,870 --> 01:03:40,650
I,

2437
01:03:40,650 --> 01:03:44,190
I stopped talking as much shit after
that cause I quit the baseball team.

2438
01:03:44,191 --> 01:03:45,150
I just disappeared.

2439
01:03:45,151 --> 01:03:45,331
Man.

2440
01:03:45,331 --> 01:03:46,164
I was gone.

2441
01:03:46,510 --> 01:03:48,360
You embarrass me in front of everybody.

2442
01:03:48,890 --> 01:03:49,810
I was like,

2443
01:03:51,170 --> 01:03:51,721
can you imagine,

2444
01:03:51,721 --> 01:03:51,900
you know,

2445
01:03:51,900 --> 01:03:52,530
was he,

2446
01:03:52,530 --> 01:03:54,420
he was like nine or 10.

2447
01:03:54,810 --> 01:03:55,643
He was the,

2448
01:03:55,700 --> 01:03:57,000
it was an eight to 12.

2449
01:03:57,060 --> 01:03:58,350
Literally it was something like that.

2450
01:03:58,351 --> 01:03:59,860
He was a younger kid.

2451
01:04:00,060 --> 01:04:00,750
You need a tissue.

2452
01:04:00,750 --> 01:04:04,770
But he grabbed my motherfucking head
and embarrass the shit out of me.

2453
01:04:04,771 --> 01:04:05,071
Man.

2454
01:04:05,071 --> 01:04:05,460
I was,

2455
01:04:05,460 --> 01:04:07,260
I felt like I was going to die.

2456
01:04:07,500 --> 01:04:08,820
I had no idea how to get out.

2457
01:04:10,560 --> 01:04:10,960
Yeah.

2458
01:04:10,960 --> 01:04:11,580
Those,

2459
01:04:11,580 --> 01:04:13,560
that's a real choke if
you can get it right.

2460
01:04:13,561 --> 01:04:13,711
I mean,

2461
01:04:13,711 --> 01:04:17,670
you've got to figure if someone like
Marcella Garcia who has an insane

2462
01:04:17,770 --> 01:04:18,510
guillotine,

2463
01:04:18,510 --> 01:04:20,640
if he can get you in the
oil school yard head chokes,

2464
01:04:20,641 --> 01:04:21,870
the squeeze is still there.

2465
01:04:22,110 --> 01:04:23,340
It's still very similar.

2466
01:04:23,850 --> 01:04:27,090
It's a very similar way of using
your arms to choke someone's neck.

2467
01:04:28,800 --> 01:04:29,730
We haven't seen it all,

2468
01:04:29,731 --> 01:04:30,120
man.

2469
01:04:30,120 --> 01:04:30,630
You remember that?

2470
01:04:30,630 --> 01:04:33,300
There was one dude who
had this crazy choke.

2471
01:04:33,780 --> 01:04:35,820
He was one of Tiger showman's guys.

2472
01:04:36,330 --> 01:04:37,050
God Damn,

2473
01:04:37,050 --> 01:04:38,370
I'm trying to remember his name.

2474
01:04:38,430 --> 01:04:39,100
He was about that.

2475
01:04:39,100 --> 01:04:42,040
Who's the founder from Gary Goodridge.

2476
01:04:42,220 --> 01:04:42,830
Oh,

2477
01:04:42,830 --> 01:04:43,910
Joe Herrera.

2478
01:04:44,860 --> 01:04:45,430
Goodrich.

2479
01:04:45,430 --> 01:04:46,263
Paul Herrera.

2480
01:04:46,360 --> 01:04:47,110
Is that up?

2481
01:04:47,110 --> 01:04:48,130
Can you find that?

2482
01:04:48,160 --> 01:04:48,701
Oh yeah.

2483
01:04:48,701 --> 01:04:52,990
You got the most brutal
Kao still an MMA history.

2484
01:04:53,190 --> 01:04:54,023
It was a brutal,

2485
01:04:54,840 --> 01:04:55,420
brutal.

2486
01:04:55,420 --> 01:04:56,560
There's nothing more brutal.

2487
01:04:56,561 --> 01:04:57,520
Gonzaga versus Cro.

2488
01:04:57,521 --> 01:04:58,450
Cop's right up there,

2489
01:04:58,480 --> 01:04:59,313
dude.

2490
01:04:59,560 --> 01:05:00,281
He was not,

2491
01:05:00,281 --> 01:05:01,150
he was in the cotton.

2492
01:05:01,151 --> 01:05:04,220
A crucifix was getting
elbowed and his faces.

2493
01:05:04,450 --> 01:05:05,380
I'm whining about blowing up,

2494
01:05:05,381 --> 01:05:05,950
but boy,

2495
01:05:05,950 --> 01:05:07,180
that was a brutal,

2496
01:05:07,600 --> 01:05:08,620
brutal man.

2497
01:05:08,740 --> 01:05:09,041
Yeah,

2498
01:05:09,041 --> 01:05:09,790
here it is.

2499
01:05:09,790 --> 01:05:10,601
He shoots in,

2500
01:05:10,601 --> 01:05:11,770
goes to the fireman's carry,

2501
01:05:11,771 --> 01:05:12,820
gets caught in a crucifix,

2502
01:05:12,970 --> 01:05:17,400
and this is where the g helped
Gary goods at the sprawl.

2503
01:05:17,500 --> 01:05:18,333
Look at this.

2504
01:05:18,670 --> 01:05:19,660
Look at this right here.

2505
01:05:19,780 --> 01:05:24,430
Look a traps that arm and then once he's
got that on Blam Blam Blam Blam Blam

2506
01:05:24,431 --> 01:05:25,270
Blam blam.

2507
01:05:25,600 --> 01:05:27,400
He is out fucking cold.

2508
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:31,960
He was out cold and he probably got
hit with like five the hard shot.

2509
01:05:31,990 --> 01:05:32,950
Did you see that Jamie?

2510
01:05:33,490 --> 01:05:34,690
While he was out cold?

2511
01:05:34,750 --> 01:05:35,770
The most brutal ever,

2512
01:05:35,771 --> 01:05:36,604
right?

2513
01:05:36,780 --> 01:05:38,260
That was brutality.

2514
01:05:38,290 --> 01:05:40,450
They didn't show a replay either when,

2515
01:05:40,600 --> 01:05:42,430
when it was online there was no replay.

2516
01:05:42,431 --> 01:05:46,280
They never got to replay blam blam
they never wanted to replay that.

2517
01:05:46,960 --> 01:05:48,250
I mean that is crazy.

2518
01:05:49,120 --> 01:05:51,220
That is one of the craziest Kaos ever.

2519
01:05:51,370 --> 01:05:52,181
Do you remember,

2520
01:05:52,181 --> 01:05:54,790
wasn't it Paul Herrera
that fought in that?

2521
01:05:54,930 --> 01:05:55,391
Do you remember?

2522
01:05:55,391 --> 01:05:58,060
There was a show that they did when the,

2523
01:05:58,090 --> 01:06:00,580
when it was illegal to
have MMA in California.

2524
01:06:00,820 --> 01:06:04,840
So they had a show and they pretended
that it was like pre scripted.

2525
01:06:05,140 --> 01:06:05,501
They're like,

2526
01:06:05,501 --> 01:06:05,771
hey,

2527
01:06:05,771 --> 01:06:07,000
this is just a show.

2528
01:06:07,210 --> 01:06:08,760
But then they had MMA fights.

2529
01:06:08,761 --> 01:06:09,594
The one that was in la.

2530
01:06:09,640 --> 01:06:10,151
Yeah.

2531
01:06:10,151 --> 01:06:13,690
I remember that years ago they were trying
to find a loophole and I feel like he

2532
01:06:13,691 --> 01:06:17,440
fought Joe Merera did he
call her rarefied show Maria?

2533
01:06:17,650 --> 01:06:18,041
And it was,

2534
01:06:18,041 --> 01:06:18,731
and everybody was like,

2535
01:06:18,731 --> 01:06:18,941
Hey,

2536
01:06:18,941 --> 01:06:19,990
this is a real fight.

2537
01:06:20,020 --> 01:06:21,220
Like what the fuck is this?

2538
01:06:21,221 --> 01:06:21,381
And,

2539
01:06:21,381 --> 01:06:22,211
but everybody was,

2540
01:06:22,211 --> 01:06:23,044
it was at the palladium.

2541
01:06:23,430 --> 01:06:24,263
What fuck was it?

2542
01:06:24,400 --> 01:06:26,230
I feel like it was
somewhere in Orange County.

2543
01:06:26,500 --> 01:06:27,880
Maybe it says it forever.

2544
01:06:28,060 --> 01:06:28,671
I can't even wear it.

2545
01:06:28,671 --> 01:06:29,180
Well,

2546
01:06:29,180 --> 01:06:31,660
I've had a warehouse.

2547
01:06:31,661 --> 01:06:33,040
We got to go up the stairs.

2548
01:06:33,340 --> 01:06:33,670
Remember,

2549
01:06:33,670 --> 01:06:34,320
man,

2550
01:06:34,320 --> 01:06:34,761
there was this,

2551
01:06:34,761 --> 01:06:37,130
all of those underground days,

2552
01:06:37,460 --> 01:06:37,780
Eddie,

2553
01:06:37,780 --> 01:06:41,740
we saw so many fucking sketchy
fights and sketchy places.

2554
01:06:41,800 --> 01:06:45,220
How many times do we go to
Indian casinos and check this up.

2555
01:06:45,340 --> 01:06:45,881
Check this out.

2556
01:06:45,881 --> 01:06:48,670
I was talking to my students
about this and now and how,

2557
01:06:48,790 --> 01:06:53,790
how I've been in the business and the
MMA business making money since 2000 as a

2558
01:06:54,430 --> 01:06:55,270
purple belt.

2559
01:06:55,450 --> 01:06:57,130
I was commentating for King of the cage.

2560
01:06:57,340 --> 01:06:59,140
So I see all these brands,

2561
01:06:59,141 --> 01:07:02,140
all these fighting brands come and go.

2562
01:07:02,290 --> 01:07:02,891
Rage,

2563
01:07:02,891 --> 01:07:03,724
athletic,

2564
01:07:03,760 --> 01:07:04,211
death,

2565
01:07:04,211 --> 01:07:04,750
Kludge,

2566
01:07:04,750 --> 01:07:08,060
all these bralettes and going,

2567
01:07:09,340 --> 01:07:10,173
all of them.

2568
01:07:10,420 --> 01:07:12,340
All of them are gone.

2569
01:07:12,760 --> 01:07:13,593
Fucking gone.

2570
01:07:14,460 --> 01:07:15,190
Gone.

2571
01:07:15,190 --> 01:07:15,401
So,

2572
01:07:15,401 --> 01:07:15,870
and I hear it.

2573
01:07:15,870 --> 01:07:16,331
You know there's,

2574
01:07:16,331 --> 01:07:17,590
there's a man,

2575
01:07:17,591 --> 01:07:21,850
you know how hard it is for these
companies that like rash guard companies,

2576
01:07:22,240 --> 01:07:22,960
man,

2577
01:07:22,960 --> 01:07:23,860
what does that hop up?

2578
01:07:24,210 --> 01:07:25,240
Hit man fighting.

2579
01:07:25,241 --> 01:07:25,721
That's it.

2580
01:07:25,721 --> 01:07:26,290
That was it.

2581
01:07:26,290 --> 01:07:27,123
That was it.

2582
01:07:27,490 --> 01:07:27,701
Yeah,

2583
01:07:27,701 --> 01:07:29,950
it was hitman fighting promotions.

2584
01:07:31,090 --> 01:07:31,600
Yeah.

2585
01:07:31,600 --> 01:07:32,433
Going through.

2586
01:07:32,560 --> 01:07:35,770
So going through all my
girlfriends fucking picture albums,

2587
01:07:36,040 --> 01:07:38,110
having sex with her is like
having sex in the time machine.

2588
01:07:38,200 --> 01:07:38,680
Okay.

2589
01:07:38,680 --> 01:07:39,310
I grew up,

2590
01:07:39,310 --> 01:07:39,810
she was,

2591
01:07:39,810 --> 01:07:40,150
she,

2592
01:07:40,150 --> 01:07:41,410
I was raised in this fucking sport.

2593
01:07:41,530 --> 01:07:44,050
Like I remember going to King
of the cage when I was 15.

2594
01:07:44,410 --> 01:07:45,243
She was there.

2595
01:07:45,730 --> 01:07:47,980
I remember I was going through a
fucking photo album and I was like,

2596
01:07:49,060 --> 01:07:49,361
Oh shit.

2597
01:07:49,361 --> 01:07:50,590
And like you were at these fights,

2598
01:07:50,600 --> 01:07:53,080
the lion's den in nine in
San Diego when I was like 15.

2599
01:07:53,800 --> 01:07:54,340
And she's like,

2600
01:07:54,340 --> 01:07:56,740
I put those fights on and I was like,

2601
01:07:57,280 --> 01:07:58,113
oh.

2602
01:07:58,240 --> 01:07:59,530
I remember looking across going,

2603
01:08:00,070 --> 01:08:00,903
Oh my God,

2604
01:08:02,480 --> 01:08:03,040
I'm going to,

2605
01:08:03,040 --> 01:08:05,110
I'm going to one day I'm going to
grow up and be a professional fighter.

2606
01:08:05,111 --> 01:08:05,891
Just like Ken shamrock.

2607
01:08:05,891 --> 01:08:07,180
I'm going to fuck chick just like that.

2608
01:08:08,380 --> 01:08:09,490
17 years later.

2609
01:08:10,460 --> 01:08:10,780
Gotcha.

2610
01:08:10,780 --> 01:08:11,613
Bitch.

2611
01:08:18,740 --> 01:08:19,730
It's so fucking weird.

2612
01:08:19,731 --> 01:08:21,140
Growing up in this entire sport,

2613
01:08:21,170 --> 01:08:23,270
we should've done more
stuff back in those days.

2614
01:08:23,271 --> 01:08:24,104
Man.

2615
01:08:24,530 --> 01:08:27,030
Those ones who went to
those newer like babies,

2616
01:08:27,031 --> 01:08:27,751
we went to those,

2617
01:08:27,751 --> 01:08:28,080
uh,

2618
01:08:28,080 --> 01:08:31,020
fucking the ones in
the Indian casino ones,

2619
01:08:31,200 --> 01:08:32,033
you know,

2620
01:08:32,060 --> 01:08:32,400
you know what?

2621
01:08:32,400 --> 01:08:33,233
I did film,

2622
01:08:33,270 --> 01:08:37,590
I filmed a lot and one thing that I found
for sure it's two weeks before I went

2623
01:08:37,591 --> 01:08:41,340
to Abu Dhabi in 2003 I had my video
camera with me the whole time.

2624
01:08:41,341 --> 01:08:46,050
I want her to make a documentary
about and you are in it a lot.

2625
01:08:46,500 --> 01:08:47,560
And I kept this footage.

2626
01:08:48,030 --> 01:08:49,170
I kept this footage.

2627
01:08:49,200 --> 01:08:51,150
It's eight hours of two weeks,

2628
01:08:51,360 --> 01:08:52,320
my training camp.

2629
01:08:52,321 --> 01:08:52,670
Wow.

2630
01:08:52,670 --> 01:08:55,440
Last two weeks of the
train come going to Brazil.

2631
01:08:55,560 --> 01:08:57,360
Did I got home video footage.

2632
01:08:57,480 --> 01:08:58,530
You're all up in it.

2633
01:08:58,800 --> 01:09:00,030
Going to Brazil,

2634
01:09:00,300 --> 01:09:01,860
coming back,

2635
01:09:02,520 --> 01:09:03,930
getting my black belt.

2636
01:09:04,140 --> 01:09:06,030
I videotaped the whole experience.

2637
01:09:06,190 --> 01:09:07,920
We never released it ever.

2638
01:09:08,370 --> 01:09:09,203
But um,

2639
01:09:10,440 --> 01:09:12,480
whereas it eventually I still got it.

2640
01:09:12,660 --> 01:09:13,290
I got it.

2641
01:09:13,290 --> 01:09:14,123
Wow.

2642
01:09:15,270 --> 01:09:15,541
Yeah.

2643
01:09:15,541 --> 01:09:18,930
It's interesting when you
realized how much time has passed.

2644
01:09:18,960 --> 01:09:20,280
Gerald is in a lot.

2645
01:09:20,460 --> 01:09:21,420
He's a big star.

2646
01:09:22,420 --> 01:09:23,200
Get out of jail.

2647
01:09:23,200 --> 01:09:24,033
Yeah.

2648
01:09:24,490 --> 01:09:25,390
Sometime this year.

2649
01:09:28,280 --> 01:09:28,470
Yeah.

2650
01:09:28,470 --> 01:09:29,710
That's isn't that weird.

2651
01:09:29,711 --> 01:09:32,620
Like you could kill people
as long as everybody agrees.

2652
01:09:32,621 --> 01:09:36,640
Well I guess you should have killed him
or he shouldn't have killed them that

2653
01:09:36,641 --> 01:09:36,911
much.

2654
01:09:36,911 --> 01:09:38,500
So we're going to have to lock
you up for a little while.

2655
01:09:38,710 --> 01:09:42,610
See and I remember Gerald from fucking
biff from when I was at fucking teenager,

2656
01:09:42,611 --> 01:09:43,444
like a little kid.

2657
01:09:44,450 --> 01:09:45,283
He was

2658
01:09:46,870 --> 01:09:47,650
so weird.

2659
01:09:47,650 --> 01:09:48,970
That's how the whole story is so,

2660
01:09:49,000 --> 01:09:50,230
so weird.

2661
01:09:50,620 --> 01:09:51,520
It's so sad.

2662
01:09:52,030 --> 01:09:52,421
You know,

2663
01:09:52,421 --> 01:09:52,631
the,

2664
01:09:52,631 --> 01:09:53,280
the,

2665
01:09:53,280 --> 01:09:53,620
the,

2666
01:09:53,620 --> 01:09:58,530
the plight of the American veteran
that comes back with PTSD and the,

2667
01:09:58,740 --> 01:09:59,360
the,

2668
01:09:59,360 --> 01:10:02,740
the issues that they have to
deal with mentally and trying to,

2669
01:10:02,741 --> 01:10:07,741
just from being in a fucking war zone
and shooting people all the time to not

2670
01:10:08,261 --> 01:10:09,520
shooting people all the time.

2671
01:10:10,450 --> 01:10:10,721
I mean,

2672
01:10:10,721 --> 01:10:11,590
that is a,

2673
01:10:12,280 --> 01:10:16,930
that is asking people to
make that adjustment is one
of the craziest things they

2674
01:10:16,931 --> 01:10:18,370
ask if people in the military,

2675
01:10:18,700 --> 01:10:22,180
it's pretty not to make the adjustment
from military to civilian life.

2676
01:10:24,070 --> 01:10:24,940
Unbelievable.

2677
01:10:25,720 --> 01:10:25,931
I mean,

2678
01:10:25,931 --> 01:10:26,980
it's really a,

2679
01:10:27,760 --> 01:10:32,760
and you think about the length
of this war from 2002 right?

2680
01:10:34,270 --> 01:10:37,270
2002 we've been in a
perpetual state of war.

2681
01:10:38,380 --> 01:10:39,400
It's just so,

2682
01:10:39,460 --> 01:10:42,520
it's so crazy when you think of how
many people have had to deal with that.

2683
01:10:42,640 --> 01:10:44,500
How many people have had a
wrestled with that issue?

2684
01:10:45,910 --> 01:10:50,560
Doesn't Obama hold the record for
president the most conflict or whatever?

2685
01:10:51,070 --> 01:10:51,251
Yeah,

2686
01:10:51,251 --> 01:10:51,880
he had,

2687
01:10:51,880 --> 01:10:55,310
he was in a war through every
single day of his presidency.

2688
01:10:55,510 --> 01:10:56,343
Jesus Christ.

2689
01:10:57,870 --> 01:10:58,601
That's not true though,

2690
01:10:58,601 --> 01:10:58,930
right?

2691
01:10:58,930 --> 01:10:59,111
Well,

2692
01:10:59,111 --> 01:11:00,250
he inherited it.

2693
01:11:00,490 --> 01:11:04,150
I mean he came in in 2008
we were already at war.

2694
01:11:04,570 --> 01:11:04,721
Yeah,

2695
01:11:04,721 --> 01:11:04,991
we have.

2696
01:11:04,991 --> 01:11:05,660
We haven't had any,

2697
01:11:05,660 --> 01:11:05,990
any,

2698
01:11:05,990 --> 01:11:08,190
any piece since that since
you said it doesn't too.

2699
01:11:08,200 --> 01:11:08,530
He said,

2700
01:11:08,530 --> 01:11:10,600
I wonder how much they can and can't do.

2701
01:11:10,690 --> 01:11:11,523
I really do.

2702
01:11:11,560 --> 01:11:12,850
I just really wonder,

2703
01:11:12,880 --> 01:11:15,030
I wonder how much power they have.

2704
01:11:15,060 --> 01:11:15,893
How am I mean?

2705
01:11:17,070 --> 01:11:20,010
What's what you're seeing now with Donald
Trump is not the best indication of it

2706
01:11:20,011 --> 01:11:20,520
because he's,

2707
01:11:20,520 --> 01:11:24,720
he seems to be like imploding the
most recent press conferences,

2708
01:11:24,721 --> 01:11:26,310
just like I have buddies,

2709
01:11:26,320 --> 01:11:28,890
they're conservative that
were calling me up and go,

2710
01:11:28,891 --> 01:11:29,370
dude,

2711
01:11:29,370 --> 01:11:30,690
I'm fucking worried now or this,

2712
01:11:30,710 --> 01:11:32,070
this guy seems unstable.

2713
01:11:32,300 --> 01:11:34,050
Or there's the most
recent press conference.

2714
01:11:34,070 --> 01:11:37,560
He did that rambling press conference
when he was talking about how,

2715
01:11:37,580 --> 01:11:40,650
what the wide margin that
he won the electoral margin.

2716
01:11:40,800 --> 01:11:41,910
And then this reporter says,

2717
01:11:41,940 --> 01:11:42,930
Mr President,

2718
01:11:42,960 --> 01:11:47,960
you stated that you want it by the
largest margin ever when in fact Barack

2719
01:11:48,210 --> 01:11:49,290
Obama's margin was much larger.

2720
01:11:49,291 --> 01:11:49,531
And he goes,

2721
01:11:49,531 --> 01:11:49,611
well,

2722
01:11:49,611 --> 01:11:50,080
I'm meant a button.

2723
01:11:50,080 --> 01:11:50,913
Republican's goes,

2724
01:11:51,240 --> 01:11:54,150
George Herbert Walker Bush
was much larger than that.

2725
01:11:54,151 --> 01:11:54,600
And he starts saying,

2726
01:11:54,600 --> 01:11:54,721
well,

2727
01:11:54,721 --> 01:11:55,110
this is this,

2728
01:11:55,110 --> 01:11:56,580
the information that
I've been given I like,

2729
01:11:56,581 --> 01:11:57,414
he's like,

2730
01:11:58,410 --> 01:12:00,230
and you're watching these crows sheds,

2731
01:12:00,240 --> 01:12:00,911
so every,

2732
01:12:00,911 --> 01:12:02,160
it's so bizarre.

2733
01:12:02,160 --> 01:12:04,860
It's like we've never had a person
that's the president like this.

2734
01:12:05,490 --> 01:12:08,190
We'd never had that kind of a
president that you just see can't.

2735
01:12:08,460 --> 01:12:09,210
And then he goes,

2736
01:12:09,210 --> 01:12:09,420
well,

2737
01:12:09,420 --> 01:12:13,320
how is the American public's supposed
to listen to you when you tell them that

2738
01:12:13,321 --> 01:12:14,101
the news is fake,

2739
01:12:14,101 --> 01:12:16,350
when the information that you're
providing is not accurate?

2740
01:12:17,070 --> 01:12:17,611
And he's like,

2741
01:12:17,611 --> 01:12:17,940
well,

2742
01:12:17,940 --> 01:12:19,350
I won by a large margin,

2743
01:12:19,351 --> 01:12:19,860
did I?

2744
01:12:19,860 --> 01:12:20,150
I,

2745
01:12:20,150 --> 01:12:21,060
I am the president.

2746
01:12:21,690 --> 01:12:22,231
And the guy's like,

2747
01:12:22,231 --> 01:12:23,064
you're the president.

2748
01:12:23,100 --> 01:12:23,933
Sure you win.

2749
01:12:25,450 --> 01:12:28,080
It's just such a strange,

2750
01:12:28,081 --> 01:12:32,370
strange time for us as a country to
have elected someone like that and to be

2751
01:12:32,371 --> 01:12:33,780
going through this process,

2752
01:12:34,050 --> 01:12:37,800
what we try to figure out what's bullshit
and what's not and what's bullshit

2753
01:12:37,801 --> 01:12:39,040
about our political system.

2754
01:12:39,660 --> 01:12:42,690
Argue with people about
everything about your life.

2755
01:12:42,810 --> 01:12:47,370
And none of it's ever nothing he says
is ever right or even remotely factual

2756
01:12:47,380 --> 01:12:49,860
thing he ever says is right
because it seems so stupid.

2757
01:12:49,920 --> 01:12:51,450
He's always full of shit about something.

2758
01:12:51,950 --> 01:12:52,930
He's full of shit about a lot.

2759
01:12:52,931 --> 01:12:53,220
Eddie.

2760
01:12:53,220 --> 01:12:53,641
You're just like,

2761
01:12:53,641 --> 01:12:55,070
what the fuck is this
guy even saying like,

2762
01:12:55,350 --> 01:12:57,420
I don't what he's supposed
to pay attention to.

2763
01:12:57,540 --> 01:12:58,373
Who's this homeboy?

2764
01:12:58,890 --> 01:12:59,340
Uh,

2765
01:12:59,340 --> 01:13:00,210
that I don't know.

2766
01:13:02,980 --> 01:13:03,410
Good.

2767
01:13:03,410 --> 01:13:04,960
So good.

2768
01:13:05,210 --> 01:13:05,871
There you go.

2769
01:13:05,871 --> 01:13:08,060
Derek Lewis as head coach Bob Perez.

2770
01:13:09,050 --> 01:13:10,670
Where's the Derrick Lewis trade out of?

2771
01:13:11,510 --> 01:13:12,343
You know,

2772
01:13:12,740 --> 01:13:13,670
I have no idea.

2773
01:13:13,700 --> 01:13:15,050
So this should be the next fight.

2774
01:13:15,051 --> 01:13:16,220
Should be Hector lumbar,

2775
01:13:16,221 --> 01:13:17,330
Johnny Hendrix,

2776
01:13:17,450 --> 01:13:17,960
Hendrix.

2777
01:13:17,960 --> 01:13:18,910
No one mark.

2778
01:13:18,911 --> 01:13:19,744
So yeah,

2779
01:13:19,820 --> 01:13:20,653
what's the next one?

2780
01:13:22,130 --> 01:13:23,270
Sam Sicilian.

2781
01:13:23,330 --> 01:13:23,511
Oh,

2782
01:13:23,511 --> 01:13:24,344
that's a good fight.

2783
01:13:25,040 --> 01:13:25,760
Gavin Tucker.

2784
01:13:25,760 --> 01:13:26,021
Sam.

2785
01:13:26,021 --> 01:13:27,200
Cecilia is fun to watch.

2786
01:13:27,500 --> 01:13:29,080
Talk about someone just throws lead.

2787
01:13:29,350 --> 01:13:29,841
Who is,

2788
01:13:29,841 --> 01:13:30,950
is there Gavin talker guy?

2789
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:32,833
Just too many fighters.

2790
01:13:33,020 --> 01:13:33,950
I don't know anybody anymore.

2791
01:13:34,010 --> 01:13:34,843
I give up.

2792
01:13:36,050 --> 01:13:40,790
There's so many fucking be brought to
research on the guys before I watch them

2793
01:13:40,940 --> 01:13:43,910
and you know what for I watch from
fight or I have to call their fights,

2794
01:13:43,911 --> 01:13:44,510
but Goddamn,

2795
01:13:44,510 --> 01:13:46,550
it's too many people now
and you have C's released.

2796
01:13:46,551 --> 01:13:47,384
A lot of them.

2797
01:13:47,550 --> 01:13:49,730
Did they little release Lorenz Larkin.

2798
01:13:50,840 --> 01:13:51,590
I have no idea.

2799
01:13:51,590 --> 01:13:52,400
That's a mistake.

2800
01:13:52,400 --> 01:13:53,240
I don't made engine anything.

2801
01:13:53,270 --> 01:13:54,980
That guy is fucking good.

2802
01:13:54,981 --> 01:13:55,191
Yeah,

2803
01:13:55,191 --> 01:13:55,490
he's,

2804
01:13:55,490 --> 01:13:57,170
he's so fucking good.

2805
01:13:57,500 --> 01:13:59,030
He's one of those guys on to watch.

2806
01:13:59,090 --> 01:14:00,260
Real fun to watch.

2807
01:14:00,440 --> 01:14:03,790
He's one of those guys that could put
it together and be the champ at one 70

2808
01:14:03,791 --> 01:14:03,911
yeah,

2809
01:14:03,911 --> 01:14:04,671
you really could.

2810
01:14:04,671 --> 01:14:05,870
He's got that potential.

2811
01:14:06,170 --> 01:14:07,520
His standup is so,

2812
01:14:07,550 --> 01:14:08,030
oh,

2813
01:14:08,030 --> 01:14:09,830
so nasty and so on.

2814
01:14:09,840 --> 01:14:10,700
Orthodox,

2815
01:14:10,850 --> 01:14:15,070
that weird oblique kick that he does
to the body that he used against Neil

2816
01:14:15,070 --> 01:14:15,903
Magni.

2817
01:14:16,420 --> 01:14:17,260
Did he throw in a way?

2818
01:14:17,261 --> 01:14:18,190
Nobody else throws it.

2819
01:14:18,250 --> 01:14:21,460
That's another new technique like
we seen like a lot of Winkle,

2820
01:14:21,461 --> 01:14:22,570
John's guys doing it to the,

2821
01:14:22,660 --> 01:14:24,430
to the legs and no one ever,

2822
01:14:24,431 --> 01:14:26,670
no one ever throws it to
that same side of the body.

2823
01:14:26,680 --> 01:14:29,530
Heal rens throws it to
the body and fucking hard.

2824
01:14:29,531 --> 01:14:30,490
He sends you flying.

2825
01:14:30,730 --> 01:14:32,440
I've been practicing that on the bag.

2826
01:14:32,710 --> 01:14:33,050
It's,

2827
01:14:33,050 --> 01:14:34,570
it's a good kick man.

2828
01:14:34,600 --> 01:14:35,890
It's a really good kick.

2829
01:14:35,891 --> 01:14:40,891
There's a lot of power to it and I liked
the impact a better then that's when he

2830
01:14:41,231 --> 01:14:42,340
fucked up Gonzaga.

2831
01:14:43,510 --> 01:14:47,830
I like the impact better than a front
kick to the body because the front kick,

2832
01:14:47,831 --> 01:14:50,410
the thing about the front kick
is even if you throw a front,

2833
01:14:50,500 --> 01:14:52,330
like a snap kick karate style,

2834
01:14:52,570 --> 01:14:54,160
your foot still gives a little,

2835
01:14:54,161 --> 01:14:56,050
your foot is kind of a flexible thing,

2836
01:14:56,320 --> 01:14:59,560
but when you throw it like that
oblique style you're going,

2837
01:14:59,561 --> 01:15:01,540
he'll in and there's no give.

2838
01:15:01,541 --> 01:15:02,620
It's just wham.

2839
01:15:03,070 --> 01:15:03,491
It's a,

2840
01:15:03,491 --> 01:15:05,440
it's a really strong kick man.

2841
01:15:06,070 --> 01:15:06,740
And it's a,

2842
01:15:06,740 --> 01:15:08,290
it's one that very few people,

2843
01:15:08,291 --> 01:15:10,270
it's kind of wing Chung
ish and a lot of ways,

2844
01:15:11,560 --> 01:15:11,980
you know,

2845
01:15:11,980 --> 01:15:14,440
I mean wing Chung uses a very
similar technique to that.

2846
01:15:14,441 --> 01:15:15,280
They use it to the legs.

2847
01:15:15,290 --> 01:15:16,123
Right.

2848
01:15:16,840 --> 01:15:18,310
I don't know what I mean.

2849
01:15:18,311 --> 01:15:18,601
Where's the,

2850
01:15:18,601 --> 01:15:20,980
what's the origination
of the oblique kick?

2851
01:15:20,981 --> 01:15:22,030
What's the origin of that?

2852
01:15:22,210 --> 01:15:22,421
Eddie,

2853
01:15:22,421 --> 01:15:23,360
do you know any idea?

2854
01:15:23,361 --> 01:15:24,720
Some asshole that,

2855
01:15:25,710 --> 01:15:28,220
I mean I'm trying to
just some Kung Fu kick.

2856
01:15:28,640 --> 01:15:30,250
I don't know if it isn't comfortable kick.

2857
01:15:30,251 --> 01:15:30,701
I mean I just,

2858
01:15:30,701 --> 01:15:34,720
I'm trying to think of like a devotees
in taekwondo because they didn't teach us

2859
01:15:34,721 --> 01:15:35,554
that in taekwondo.

2860
01:15:36,430 --> 01:15:37,263
I mean I'm,

2861
01:15:37,780 --> 01:15:40,900
the only thing that's similar
to it was there was a,

2862
01:15:41,260 --> 01:15:45,100
you would do like a front
kick in a different way
sometimes where you would do a

2863
01:15:45,101 --> 01:15:45,870
stomp.

2864
01:15:45,870 --> 01:15:49,000
Like I would do a front kick sometimes
where I would throw it and I would throw

2865
01:15:49,001 --> 01:15:49,631
it with the heel.

2866
01:15:49,631 --> 01:15:51,670
I put the money back now to the chest,

2867
01:15:52,300 --> 01:15:54,590
I throw it and I pull
the foot way back and,

2868
01:15:54,591 --> 01:15:56,170
and land with the heel.

2869
01:15:57,340 --> 01:15:59,470
And you could get a lot
of power off of that.

2870
01:15:59,950 --> 01:16:02,020
But I like this too,

2871
01:16:02,021 --> 01:16:02,261
man.

2872
01:16:02,261 --> 01:16:03,670
I think this might be even better,

2873
01:16:04,270 --> 01:16:06,160
just like a little bit
of a twist to the leg,

2874
01:16:06,640 --> 01:16:07,101
the way,

2875
01:16:07,101 --> 01:16:07,810
um,

2876
01:16:07,810 --> 01:16:10,360
you're seeing Lorens throw it.

2877
01:16:10,600 --> 01:16:12,840
But Lorens might have
moved on to bell tour,

2878
01:16:12,850 --> 01:16:13,061
man,

2879
01:16:13,061 --> 01:16:13,894
I don't know.

2880
01:16:14,020 --> 01:16:14,920
I haven't talked to him,

2881
01:16:15,460 --> 01:16:17,170
but I know that they were all negotiating.

2882
01:16:17,180 --> 01:16:20,260
And if Bella tour puts
Lorenza in there too.

2883
01:16:20,390 --> 01:16:20,670
That's,

2884
01:16:20,670 --> 01:16:21,010
that's it.

2885
01:16:21,010 --> 01:16:22,240
That's who really good,

2886
01:16:22,241 --> 01:16:23,074
good way clash.

2887
01:16:23,080 --> 01:16:24,130
It's a fucking fuck.

2888
01:16:24,160 --> 01:16:27,520
Almost commensurate with the
UFC and the UFC has Damien Maia,

2889
01:16:27,700 --> 01:16:29,440
cowboy Donald Serone.

2890
01:16:30,250 --> 01:16:32,830
Tell me you wouldn't want to see
Donald Cerrone versus Lauren's Larkin.

2891
01:16:32,831 --> 01:16:34,090
Holy Shit.

2892
01:16:34,840 --> 01:16:35,111
Yeah,

2893
01:16:35,111 --> 01:16:36,360
that would be holy shit.

2894
01:16:37,030 --> 01:16:38,890
Or Lorens versus Mazda doll.

2895
01:16:38,920 --> 01:16:40,240
I would like to see that fight too.

2896
01:16:40,420 --> 01:16:43,030
I just want to see one of those people
put again now that you brought that up

2897
01:16:43,450 --> 01:16:43,960
please.

2898
01:16:43,960 --> 01:16:45,790
That's a fucking Christmas
present for about

2899
01:16:47,360 --> 01:16:50,800
one 70 might be the most talent
rich division in the UFC right now.

2900
01:16:52,420 --> 01:16:56,290
And the idea that Connor might one day
step up to try to fight whoever wins

2901
01:16:56,291 --> 01:16:58,230
Woodley versus Wonderboy.

2902
01:16:59,820 --> 01:17:01,390
That would have been the craziest move.

2903
01:17:01,540 --> 01:17:02,320
I mean it looks,

2904
01:17:02,320 --> 01:17:04,810
lear really looks like he's
going to fight Floyd Mayweather.

2905
01:17:05,620 --> 01:17:06,160
Connor.

2906
01:17:06,160 --> 01:17:06,461
Yeah.

2907
01:17:06,461 --> 01:17:07,720
It really looks like it's gonna happen.

2908
01:17:07,721 --> 01:17:09,250
It looks like there's
too much money to stop.

2909
01:17:09,470 --> 01:17:10,081
That's what I'm saying.

2910
01:17:10,081 --> 01:17:11,930
So then I was thinking is
that you have seen needs to,

2911
01:17:11,960 --> 01:17:13,280
they need to get a return on this.

2912
01:17:13,520 --> 01:17:14,510
All the money they borrowed.

2913
01:17:15,230 --> 01:17:16,580
What the best way to make that money back,

2914
01:17:16,800 --> 01:17:17,633
having that fight.

2915
01:17:17,810 --> 01:17:19,130
But it's a weird fight.

2916
01:17:19,400 --> 01:17:20,030
How do you,

2917
01:17:20,030 --> 01:17:21,560
what do you do with that fight?

2918
01:17:22,520 --> 01:17:24,410
You got to make an it in boxing.

2919
01:17:24,411 --> 01:17:25,700
You can't make it in an MMA.

2920
01:17:25,701 --> 01:17:26,960
It's not going to be an MMA fight.

2921
01:17:26,990 --> 01:17:28,190
Floyd is not going to agree to that.

2922
01:17:28,310 --> 01:17:29,570
So it's gotta be a boxing fight.

2923
01:17:29,930 --> 01:17:30,950
It'll be a and match.

2924
01:17:31,250 --> 01:17:32,930
So you don't have it in the UFC though.

2925
01:17:33,140 --> 01:17:33,801
So the UFC,

2926
01:17:33,801 --> 01:17:34,820
what cope promotes,

2927
01:17:34,970 --> 01:17:35,750
like what do they do?

2928
01:17:35,750 --> 01:17:35,901
They,

2929
01:17:35,901 --> 01:17:38,090
all three of them get together
as a promotional entity.

2930
01:17:38,091 --> 01:17:39,740
And what kind of precedent does that set,

2931
01:17:40,520 --> 01:17:43,160
you know exactly as far as control,

2932
01:17:43,161 --> 01:17:43,730
like no,

2933
01:17:43,730 --> 01:17:47,660
no organization has ever had the
kind of control that the UFC has,

2934
01:17:47,960 --> 01:17:48,320
right?

2935
01:17:48,320 --> 01:17:48,861
It's like it's an,

2936
01:17:48,861 --> 01:17:50,540
it's an epic level of control.

2937
01:17:50,860 --> 01:17:51,280
They,

2938
01:17:51,280 --> 01:17:52,113
they can choose to,

2939
01:17:52,280 --> 01:17:52,431
oh,

2940
01:17:52,431 --> 01:17:53,750
there's going to be for the interim title.

2941
01:17:53,930 --> 01:17:54,171
Hey,

2942
01:17:54,171 --> 01:17:54,921
Tony Ferguson,

2943
01:17:54,921 --> 01:17:55,760
Habib Neuro off.

2944
01:17:55,940 --> 01:17:56,773
Congratulations.

2945
01:17:56,930 --> 01:17:59,120
I know Connor just won the
title a couple of months ago,

2946
01:17:59,121 --> 01:18:00,640
but the way we see it,

2947
01:18:00,730 --> 01:18:01,690
I've got another guy here.

2948
01:18:01,700 --> 01:18:02,780
You guys can be the champ.

2949
01:18:03,020 --> 01:18:06,080
I mean we have two interim
champs right now if that happens.

2950
01:18:06,110 --> 01:18:06,500
Right,

2951
01:18:06,500 --> 01:18:08,780
because Max Holloway's the interim champ.

2952
01:18:08,930 --> 01:18:11,210
Max Holloway doesn't give a
fuck about that title either.

2953
01:18:11,540 --> 01:18:12,081
I mean his,

2954
01:18:12,081 --> 01:18:14,870
he's just got his eyes on Jose
Aldo when they gave him that belt.

2955
01:18:14,900 --> 01:18:16,520
I mean he literally was
like this on the belt.

2956
01:18:16,521 --> 01:18:17,030
I want,

2957
01:18:17,030 --> 01:18:17,480
yeah,

2958
01:18:17,480 --> 01:18:18,260
I want the real one.

2959
01:18:18,260 --> 01:18:19,160
I want to fight all though.

2960
01:18:20,000 --> 01:18:23,690
So that makes at least some more sense.

2961
01:18:24,200 --> 01:18:25,730
Thank God they're doing
another King Kong movie.

2962
01:18:27,410 --> 01:18:28,220
Exactly what we need.

2963
01:18:28,220 --> 01:18:32,090
Life and an even bigger can
come even bigger than ever.

2964
01:18:32,490 --> 01:18:32,950
Yeah.

2965
01:18:32,950 --> 01:18:33,530
I mean,

2966
01:18:33,530 --> 01:18:34,221
come on man.

2967
01:18:34,221 --> 01:18:35,054
How are they?

2968
01:18:35,580 --> 01:18:38,330
They couldn't hide the first
little one who is like,

2969
01:18:38,600 --> 01:18:38,961
he was,

2970
01:18:38,961 --> 01:18:39,291
you know,

2971
01:18:39,291 --> 01:18:40,370
fucking seven feet tall.

2972
01:18:40,371 --> 01:18:41,330
We have Google earth now,

2973
01:18:41,331 --> 01:18:41,720
bitch.

2974
01:18:41,720 --> 01:18:41,931
Yeah,

2975
01:18:41,931 --> 01:18:43,850
this thing's fucking 60 feet tall now.

2976
01:18:43,851 --> 01:18:44,480
He's not going to be high.

2977
01:18:44,480 --> 01:18:46,040
The first one was 50 feet tall.

2978
01:18:46,400 --> 01:18:48,500
This one's got Zillow was 500 feet tall,

2979
01:18:48,501 --> 01:18:50,600
which is one of the things that
made Godzilla versus King Kong.

2980
01:18:50,601 --> 01:18:51,620
So fucking stupid.

2981
01:18:51,880 --> 01:18:52,940
Because when he went to Japan,

2982
01:18:52,941 --> 01:18:55,070
all of a sudden King Kong
was 500 feet tall too.

2983
01:18:55,310 --> 01:18:55,551
So.

2984
01:18:55,551 --> 01:18:55,661
Well,

2985
01:18:55,661 --> 01:18:56,121
what the hell,

2986
01:18:56,121 --> 01:18:56,730
man?

2987
01:18:56,730 --> 01:18:58,520
Remember when he was climbing
the empire state building?

2988
01:18:58,521 --> 01:18:59,570
He was not that big.

2989
01:18:59,600 --> 01:19:00,080
He was about,

2990
01:19:00,080 --> 01:19:00,913
yeah.

2991
01:19:01,490 --> 01:19:02,200
No,

2992
01:19:02,200 --> 01:19:03,110
not much bigger than I am.

2993
01:19:03,140 --> 01:19:04,130
They just vary it.

2994
01:19:04,340 --> 01:19:04,941
I just love,

2995
01:19:04,941 --> 01:19:05,331
they keep,

2996
01:19:05,331 --> 01:19:10,170
they run out of ideas I guess so they
just keep doing the same idea with Martha.

2997
01:19:10,740 --> 01:19:11,690
How about the turtle?

2998
01:19:11,780 --> 01:19:16,070
Remember Gamarra he was spin
around rockets would shoot
out all his holes and he

2999
01:19:16,071 --> 01:19:17,240
would spin around in a circle.

3000
01:19:17,310 --> 01:19:18,143
Remember that shit?

3001
01:19:19,880 --> 01:19:20,920
You don't remember gamma?

3002
01:19:20,921 --> 01:19:21,580
No.

3003
01:19:21,580 --> 01:19:22,230
Oh Dude.

3004
01:19:22,230 --> 01:19:24,410
Camera was the stupidest
fucking monster ever.

3005
01:19:26,970 --> 01:19:27,870
You Remember Camera?

3006
01:19:28,310 --> 01:19:29,270
If he showed me,

3007
01:19:29,420 --> 01:19:30,440
I would remember Jamie.

3008
01:19:30,441 --> 01:19:31,070
We'll pull it up.

3009
01:19:31,070 --> 01:19:31,930
He'll pull up gamma.

3010
01:19:32,540 --> 01:19:33,560
I remember Mothra.

3011
01:19:33,680 --> 01:19:33,831
Yeah,

3012
01:19:33,831 --> 01:19:36,530
I remember Mothra super
moth was stupid as fuck.

3013
01:19:36,531 --> 01:19:38,720
Cause heat and everybody's
sweaters broken.

3014
01:19:38,721 --> 01:19:40,460
A sweater factory is fucked it up.

3015
01:19:42,370 --> 01:19:43,071
Your sweaters,

3016
01:19:43,071 --> 01:19:43,520
man.

3017
01:19:43,520 --> 01:19:46,820
I have a lot of wool shit
like like hunting stuff.

3018
01:19:46,821 --> 01:19:50,840
A lot of it is made out a wall and
a fucking Moss will get in my house,

3019
01:19:50,841 --> 01:19:51,051
man.

3020
01:19:51,051 --> 01:19:52,340
And she was shit out of my wall.

3021
01:19:52,700 --> 01:19:56,480
There's a camera for sending
me some stuff by the way.

3022
01:19:56,600 --> 01:19:56,930
Ah,

3023
01:19:56,930 --> 01:19:57,630
beautiful thing.

3024
01:19:57,630 --> 01:19:58,463
Would they send you?

3025
01:19:58,770 --> 01:19:59,603
Um,

3026
01:19:59,860 --> 01:20:02,960
just a little set of short or some pants.

3027
01:20:02,990 --> 01:20:03,860
I'm wearing a second.

3028
01:20:04,020 --> 01:20:04,330
Sitka,

3029
01:20:04,330 --> 01:20:07,410
Jack and now the mortal
Emery enemies of you,

3030
01:20:07,560 --> 01:20:08,393
but not really.

3031
01:20:08,400 --> 01:20:09,690
I had to choose sides.

3032
01:20:09,730 --> 01:20:10,051
It's there.

3033
01:20:10,051 --> 01:20:10,561
Those people,

3034
01:20:10,561 --> 01:20:12,060
we're all so competitive with each other.

3035
01:20:12,061 --> 01:20:13,890
All those people in those businesses.

3036
01:20:14,100 --> 01:20:15,600
I guess that's the same with MMA too,

3037
01:20:15,601 --> 01:20:16,170
right?

3038
01:20:16,170 --> 01:20:19,620
Like the UFC in Beltour super
competitive with each other,

3039
01:20:19,621 --> 01:20:20,454
but yeah,

3040
01:20:20,790 --> 01:20:21,750
I refuse.

3041
01:20:21,780 --> 01:20:23,070
Does tap out still exist?

3042
01:20:23,071 --> 01:20:23,680
No.

3043
01:20:23,680 --> 01:20:24,331
No they do,

3044
01:20:24,331 --> 01:20:25,150
but they don't look,

3045
01:20:25,150 --> 01:20:26,490
I just see it on the ground in India.

3046
01:20:26,700 --> 01:20:27,181
They do what?

3047
01:20:27,181 --> 01:20:27,620
They don't.

3048
01:20:27,620 --> 01:20:29,070
They're are there in pro wrestling now,

3049
01:20:30,420 --> 01:20:31,230
but they don't.

3050
01:20:31,230 --> 01:20:31,590
Yeah,

3051
01:20:31,590 --> 01:20:32,190
I mean it's just,

3052
01:20:32,190 --> 01:20:32,491
it was,

3053
01:20:32,491 --> 01:20:36,260
that's an example how wrestling pro
wrestling is a thought with tap out now

3054
01:20:36,420 --> 01:20:39,690
bought out fucking years ago
and then got what an hour.

3055
01:20:39,720 --> 01:20:40,553
Who knows?

3056
01:20:41,110 --> 01:20:44,220
They have some sort of a deal with pro
wrestling now we're tap out is a big part

3057
01:20:44,221 --> 01:20:45,054
of pro wrestling.

3058
01:20:45,270 --> 01:20:46,650
They have to wear tap out shit.

3059
01:20:47,500 --> 01:20:48,333
Yeah.

3060
01:20:50,790 --> 01:20:51,511
That was the best thing.

3061
01:20:51,511 --> 01:20:53,610
They could go get that crowd.

3062
01:20:53,820 --> 01:20:54,180
I don't,

3063
01:20:54,180 --> 01:20:54,451
I mean,

3064
01:20:54,451 --> 01:20:56,070
I don't know if they
can get them the right,

3065
01:20:56,220 --> 01:20:57,300
I don't know if they can get them.

3066
01:20:57,350 --> 01:20:57,460
Oh,

3067
01:20:57,460 --> 01:20:58,710
I think they did and they got him.

3068
01:20:59,280 --> 01:20:59,761
But did we,

3069
01:20:59,761 --> 01:21:00,481
do they have on though?

3070
01:21:00,481 --> 01:21:02,340
Do you see like people
wearing tap out anymore?

3071
01:21:02,780 --> 01:21:06,480
I think I'd have tap out shirts with pro
wrestling on it if I fucking hope mask

3072
01:21:06,540 --> 01:21:06,950
was a lot.

3073
01:21:06,950 --> 01:21:07,411
There we go.

3074
01:21:07,411 --> 01:21:07,911
Tap Out,

3075
01:21:07,911 --> 01:21:08,190
look.

3076
01:21:08,190 --> 01:21:08,341
Oh,

3077
01:21:08,341 --> 01:21:09,001
it's different.

3078
01:21:09,001 --> 01:21:09,990
Looked at new logo.

3079
01:21:11,540 --> 01:21:11,750
Okay.

3080
01:21:11,750 --> 01:21:13,470
Still Bulky.

3081
01:21:13,860 --> 01:21:14,693
Who's that guy?

3082
01:21:15,060 --> 01:21:15,893
Jamie.

3083
01:21:16,020 --> 01:21:16,740
Jamie.

3084
01:21:16,740 --> 01:21:17,610
They ticket to death.

3085
01:21:17,640 --> 01:21:18,670
They took it to his class.

3086
01:21:19,290 --> 01:21:21,350
He's got a totally different look.

3087
01:21:21,370 --> 01:21:22,141
The new logo,

3088
01:21:22,141 --> 01:21:23,890
the t above the old good move.

3089
01:21:24,040 --> 01:21:25,200
Fast move.

3090
01:21:25,870 --> 01:21:26,580
Still.

3091
01:21:26,580 --> 01:21:27,900
It's one of those brands.

3092
01:21:27,901 --> 01:21:29,760
It's just the genes there.

3093
01:21:29,761 --> 01:21:30,594
I see.

3094
01:21:30,720 --> 01:21:33,060
It just got so beaten down.

3095
01:21:33,210 --> 01:21:35,280
It's just one of those
things that just can brands,

3096
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:37,800
no brands make it not an MMA,

3097
01:21:37,801 --> 01:21:38,130
right.

3098
01:21:38,130 --> 01:21:39,990
No brands make it Reebok's.

3099
01:21:39,991 --> 01:21:40,824
Gonna make it though,

3100
01:21:41,170 --> 01:21:41,670
do you think?

3101
01:21:41,670 --> 01:21:42,421
No other bands.

3102
01:21:42,421 --> 01:21:44,670
So Reebok is a brand outside of MMA.

3103
01:21:44,671 --> 01:21:46,890
That's why it's going to
make it an MMA sort of,

3104
01:21:46,920 --> 01:21:50,070
but the only reason why it's making
it an MMA because of the UFC deal.

3105
01:21:50,120 --> 01:21:50,570
Yeah.

3106
01:21:50,570 --> 01:21:50,971
Yeah.

3107
01:21:50,971 --> 01:21:51,490
You know what?

3108
01:21:51,490 --> 01:21:52,320
It's forced.

3109
01:21:52,320 --> 01:21:54,510
I kind of pants now.

3110
01:21:54,511 --> 01:21:55,420
I wear them all the time.

3111
01:21:55,700 --> 01:21:56,550
I rock him right now.

3112
01:21:56,580 --> 01:21:57,413
Look and see that.

3113
01:21:57,480 --> 01:21:58,313
What are you saying Jamie,

3114
01:21:58,560 --> 01:21:58,930
do?

3115
01:21:58,930 --> 01:21:59,763
Just a few years ago,

3116
01:22:00,390 --> 01:22:02,100
tap out did no Reebok.

3117
01:22:02,160 --> 01:22:02,490
Oh,

3118
01:22:02,490 --> 01:22:03,323
okay.

3119
01:22:04,130 --> 01:22:04,890
That makes sense.

3120
01:22:04,890 --> 01:22:05,700
Yeah.

3121
01:22:05,700 --> 01:22:06,750
Their stuff is comfortable.

3122
01:22:06,870 --> 01:22:07,930
I'd like it's gotten better.

3123
01:22:07,960 --> 01:22:10,680
The first I was critical like most,

3124
01:22:10,770 --> 01:22:12,300
but I actually like wearing them.

3125
01:22:12,301 --> 01:22:13,140
I wear them all the time.

3126
01:22:13,170 --> 01:22:14,220
They make good stuff.

3127
01:22:14,221 --> 01:22:15,090
That's not the problem.

3128
01:22:15,120 --> 01:22:18,840
The problem is what happened with the
deal to MMA fighters had had sponsorships

3129
01:22:19,050 --> 01:22:21,840
before the Reebok deal came around
and how much money they lost.

3130
01:22:21,860 --> 01:22:22,320
Yes.

3131
01:22:22,320 --> 01:22:23,160
That's the real problem.

3132
01:22:23,161 --> 01:22:23,720
It's not,

3133
01:22:23,720 --> 01:22:25,530
it's nothing to do with
the quality of their items,

3134
01:22:25,531 --> 01:22:27,450
which is kind of fucked for the company.

3135
01:22:27,451 --> 01:22:27,920
Yeah.

3136
01:22:27,920 --> 01:22:29,850
Can we think about all
the negative energy,

3137
01:22:30,000 --> 01:22:33,840
the negative press that they've gotten
from MMA fans that are mad at the deal?

3138
01:22:33,900 --> 01:22:38,070
I was making very good money from
sponsors and they like eight grand a month

3139
01:22:38,160 --> 01:22:39,090
when I first got in UFC

3140
01:22:40,700 --> 01:22:42,150
just from sponsors or sponsors.

3141
01:22:42,270 --> 01:22:43,650
And how much have you made from top out?

3142
01:22:44,040 --> 01:22:44,330
Oh,

3143
01:22:44,330 --> 01:22:44,480
tad.

3144
01:22:44,480 --> 01:22:47,450
That paid me so much that
that would never thought.

3145
01:22:49,920 --> 01:22:51,210
How much did you made for me buck?

3146
01:22:51,790 --> 01:22:52,720
Uh,

3147
01:22:52,800 --> 01:22:53,640
I'll make five.

3148
01:22:54,390 --> 01:22:55,223
Five per fight.

3149
01:22:55,230 --> 01:22:55,980
Yeah.

3150
01:22:55,980 --> 01:22:57,720
And there's no other
sponsors involved anymore?

3151
01:22:57,721 --> 01:22:58,380
No,

3152
01:22:58,380 --> 01:22:58,711
but I mean,

3153
01:22:58,711 --> 01:22:58,861
you know,

3154
01:22:58,861 --> 01:22:59,694
like I,

3155
01:22:59,760 --> 01:23:00,331
everything I had,

3156
01:23:00,331 --> 01:23:04,050
everything I ever wears aisle is all from
companies that would sponsor me if I,

3157
01:23:04,051 --> 01:23:06,220
if I like Ruca or like this company

3158
01:23:06,220 --> 01:23:07,053
or whatever,

3159
01:23:07,390 --> 01:23:09,430
they would sponsor me if it
was a fucking point to it.

3160
01:23:09,460 --> 01:23:09,611
Now,

3161
01:23:09,611 --> 01:23:10,600
how's your podcast doing?

3162
01:23:10,601 --> 01:23:11,710
I know you're doing a podcast now,

3163
01:23:11,770 --> 01:23:14,860
Eric Apple is that my podcast,

3164
01:23:15,040 --> 01:23:16,510
which is story time with uncle creepy.

3165
01:23:16,570 --> 01:23:20,800
That's just me kind of getting more
in depth than just ripping you off.

3166
01:23:20,801 --> 01:23:23,830
Basically talking to my friends that are
interested in me off I'd run out of the

3167
01:23:23,831 --> 01:23:24,730
people for me.

3168
01:23:24,731 --> 01:23:27,010
So it's everybody's ripping
everybody off in this genre.

3169
01:23:27,040 --> 01:23:27,790
Exactly.

3170
01:23:27,790 --> 01:23:28,241
Uh,

3171
01:23:28,241 --> 01:23:30,610
and then the other one is
there's two American animals.

3172
01:23:30,970 --> 01:23:32,470
It's me and my cohost Eric Apple,

3173
01:23:32,471 --> 01:23:33,730
who's been my,

3174
01:23:33,731 --> 01:23:35,650
one of my best friends
for our entire lives.

3175
01:23:36,250 --> 01:23:36,551
We just,

3176
01:23:36,551 --> 01:23:37,384
we grew up together.

3177
01:23:37,510 --> 01:23:37,871
Um,

3178
01:23:37,871 --> 01:23:38,704
but we just,

3179
01:23:38,740 --> 01:23:39,700
it's utter nonsense,

3180
01:23:39,701 --> 01:23:40,230
pretty much.

3181
01:23:40,230 --> 01:23:40,280
It,

3182
01:23:40,280 --> 01:23:41,590
we just talk shit and have some fun,

3183
01:23:41,620 --> 01:23:43,060
just have fun and fuck around.

3184
01:23:43,061 --> 01:23:43,781
And so,

3185
01:23:43,781 --> 01:23:44,111
you know,

3186
01:23:44,111 --> 01:23:44,351
they're,

3187
01:23:44,351 --> 01:23:45,051
they're both a,

3188
01:23:45,051 --> 01:23:47,130
you can find them on Youtube or,

3189
01:23:47,250 --> 01:23:47,630
or,

3190
01:23:47,630 --> 01:23:48,463
uh,

3191
01:23:48,610 --> 01:23:51,340
was iTunes on any of this
stuff you can do usually.

3192
01:23:51,400 --> 01:23:51,700
Yeah.

3193
01:23:51,700 --> 01:23:55,110
I heard one of them where I heard like
one of the intros where Eric was talking

3194
01:23:55,130 --> 01:23:58,380
about sort of a lot of the social issues
that are going on in the world today is

3195
01:23:58,381 --> 01:23:59,560
very aware of dude.

3196
01:23:59,950 --> 01:24:00,700
He tries.

3197
01:24:00,700 --> 01:24:01,360
Yeah.

3198
01:24:01,360 --> 01:24:01,961
He's,

3199
01:24:01,961 --> 01:24:03,310
he's a little abrasive at times.

3200
01:24:03,650 --> 01:24:03,920
Please.

3201
01:24:03,920 --> 01:24:04,900
Makoto was saying

3202
01:24:07,100 --> 01:24:07,380
he's,

3203
01:24:07,380 --> 01:24:07,510
but,

3204
01:24:07,510 --> 01:24:08,110
you know.

3205
01:24:08,110 --> 01:24:08,321
Yeah,

3206
01:24:08,321 --> 01:24:08,760
exactly.

3207
01:24:08,760 --> 01:24:09,010
Uh,

3208
01:24:09,010 --> 01:24:09,370
but no,

3209
01:24:09,370 --> 01:24:10,210
Eric's awesome.

3210
01:24:10,270 --> 01:24:10,481
You know,

3211
01:24:10,481 --> 01:24:10,900
he's,

3212
01:24:10,900 --> 01:24:11,733
he's,

3213
01:24:11,890 --> 01:24:12,251
like I said,

3214
01:24:12,251 --> 01:24:12,941
is one of my best friends.

3215
01:24:12,941 --> 01:24:13,071
He's,

3216
01:24:13,071 --> 01:24:14,440
he taught me how to change
my daughter's diaper.

3217
01:24:14,790 --> 01:24:15,220
Did he really?

3218
01:24:15,220 --> 01:24:16,460
He walked in the fucking
hospital and I was,

3219
01:24:16,490 --> 01:24:17,650
I didn't know how to change diapers.

3220
01:24:18,100 --> 01:24:19,570
He'd helped raise his sister and stuff.

3221
01:24:19,900 --> 01:24:20,830
And I'm sitting there and I was like,

3222
01:24:20,831 --> 01:24:21,560
what the fuck?

3223
01:24:21,560 --> 01:24:21,770
Well,

3224
01:24:21,770 --> 01:24:22,603
who are you?

3225
01:24:22,930 --> 01:24:23,210
He's like,

3226
01:24:23,210 --> 01:24:23,340
Nah,

3227
01:24:23,340 --> 01:24:23,510
Bro,

3228
01:24:23,510 --> 01:24:24,270
just to their great diaper.

3229
01:24:24,270 --> 01:24:24,551
Come here.

3230
01:24:24,551 --> 01:24:24,850
I'm like,

3231
01:24:24,850 --> 01:24:25,131
Jesus,

3232
01:24:25,131 --> 01:24:25,301
God,

3233
01:24:25,301 --> 01:24:27,910
he's like the uncle that takes
us to Disneyland all the time.

3234
01:24:28,420 --> 01:24:29,253
But um,

3235
01:24:29,710 --> 01:24:30,130
you know,

3236
01:24:30,130 --> 01:24:30,550
if,

3237
01:24:30,550 --> 01:24:31,091
if you,

3238
01:24:31,091 --> 01:24:32,470
if you want to just hear us,

3239
01:24:32,471 --> 01:24:33,370
just having fun,

3240
01:24:33,371 --> 01:24:34,204
screwing around,

3241
01:24:34,690 --> 01:24:34,961
you know,

3242
01:24:34,961 --> 01:24:36,400
to American animals is always a good time.

3243
01:24:36,720 --> 01:24:37,000
Well,

3244
01:24:37,000 --> 01:24:39,760
now that people have seen
how much Brendan Schaub,

3245
01:24:39,990 --> 01:24:40,380
you know,

3246
01:24:40,380 --> 01:24:41,213
has a,

3247
01:24:41,430 --> 01:24:45,190
how well he's transitioned from being
a fighter to be in a podcast or,

3248
01:24:45,191 --> 01:24:46,750
and Brendan works hard.

3249
01:24:46,751 --> 01:24:46,961
I mean,

3250
01:24:46,961 --> 01:24:48,460
he fucking hustles.

3251
01:24:48,790 --> 01:24:50,770
He's constantly making new t shirts,

3252
01:24:50,771 --> 01:24:53,350
constantly promoting his episodes,

3253
01:24:53,351 --> 01:24:55,000
working on getting better guests.

3254
01:24:55,310 --> 01:24:55,661
I mean,

3255
01:24:55,661 --> 01:24:57,820
he's really gone at it and attacked it.

3256
01:24:57,821 --> 01:24:59,080
He's not taking it lightly.

3257
01:24:59,470 --> 01:24:59,950
And some,

3258
01:24:59,950 --> 01:25:01,010
some people they,

3259
01:25:01,130 --> 01:25:03,460
they look at podcasting and you know,

3260
01:25:03,461 --> 01:25:04,300
they just take it lightly.

3261
01:25:04,301 --> 01:25:04,960
They don't,

3262
01:25:04,960 --> 01:25:05,920
they don't get serious about it.

3263
01:25:05,921 --> 01:25:07,900
He got super serious
about it and you know,

3264
01:25:07,901 --> 01:25:10,660
he's the to you two guys are
the ones that have really,

3265
01:25:10,940 --> 01:25:11,211
we're like,

3266
01:25:11,211 --> 01:25:11,321
hey,

3267
01:25:11,321 --> 01:25:11,741
dumbed down,

3268
01:25:11,741 --> 01:25:12,160
do it,

3269
01:25:12,160 --> 01:25:12,401
you know,

3270
01:25:12,401 --> 01:25:12,970
like get it done.

3271
01:25:12,970 --> 01:25:13,540
So that's what I've been,

3272
01:25:13,540 --> 01:25:15,520
I've been really busted my ass to do.

3273
01:25:16,390 --> 01:25:16,660
And what,

3274
01:25:16,660 --> 01:25:19,110
you're an interesting guy and
you're smart and you know a,

3275
01:25:19,111 --> 01:25:22,440
a person like you can
legitimately transfer,

3276
01:25:22,720 --> 01:25:23,740
transfer and do,

3277
01:25:23,800 --> 01:25:25,540
do something else outside of fighting.

3278
01:25:25,760 --> 01:25:26,410
Yeah.

3279
01:25:26,410 --> 01:25:27,161
That's what I wanted to do.

3280
01:25:27,161 --> 01:25:27,321
You know,

3281
01:25:27,321 --> 01:25:27,511
I,

3282
01:25:27,511 --> 01:25:28,344
I like,

3283
01:25:28,450 --> 01:25:28,860
I just,

3284
01:25:28,860 --> 01:25:30,040
this the name is a little silly,

3285
01:25:30,041 --> 01:25:30,191
you know,

3286
01:25:30,191 --> 01:25:31,360
story time with uncle creepy.

3287
01:25:31,361 --> 01:25:34,270
But like I get to get to do whether it's,

3288
01:25:34,271 --> 01:25:34,511
you know,

3289
01:25:34,511 --> 01:25:35,344
like yeah,

3290
01:25:35,580 --> 01:25:35,890
you know,

3291
01:25:35,890 --> 01:25:37,140
he's still pocket interviewing,

3292
01:25:37,450 --> 01:25:37,651
you know,

3293
01:25:37,651 --> 01:25:38,484
just do a podcast.

3294
01:25:38,830 --> 01:25:39,670
Nick and Nate Diaz,

3295
01:25:39,790 --> 01:25:41,080
this should just get blasted.

3296
01:25:41,100 --> 01:25:41,460
They should,

3297
01:25:41,460 --> 01:25:42,041
they should do a,

3298
01:25:42,041 --> 01:25:45,730
let's get blasted with nick and Nate
Diaz and just found fucking bong on the

3299
01:25:45,731 --> 01:25:46,260
table.

3300
01:25:46,260 --> 01:25:51,160
I would the size of a nuclear missile and
just fire it up and just start talking

3301
01:25:51,161 --> 01:25:54,190
shit about everything and have people
on how people get blasted with them.

3302
01:25:54,220 --> 01:25:54,640
Yes.

3303
01:25:54,640 --> 01:25:55,500
Get incoherent.

3304
01:25:55,660 --> 01:25:56,920
Forget what they're talking about.

3305
01:25:57,130 --> 01:26:02,130
Just blasted radio blasted radio slash
two oh nine with nick and Diaz lasted to,

3306
01:26:05,390 --> 01:26:08,270
how the fuck could they not have
an episode two oh nine in Stockton.

3307
01:26:08,450 --> 01:26:11,120
They have UFC 209 is coming
up and it's not in Stockton.

3308
01:26:11,210 --> 01:26:11,690
I Dunno.

3309
01:26:11,690 --> 01:26:13,190
That shit is unconscionable.

3310
01:26:13,580 --> 01:26:17,060
They had one opportunity ever in
the history of the UFC and then do,

3311
01:26:17,150 --> 01:26:18,260
they should have planned it.

3312
01:26:18,590 --> 01:26:21,380
Like I planned episode
nine 11 to be Alex Jones.

3313
01:26:21,950 --> 01:26:26,950
He should've planned episode two oh nine
to be in fucking Stockton with Nick and

3314
01:26:27,560 --> 01:26:27,860
Nate Diaz.

3315
01:26:27,860 --> 01:26:32,000
I guarantee you that shit would have
gotten 2 million paper view bys for sure.

3316
01:26:32,650 --> 01:26:37,650
Well they said if it just bomb UFC
two oh nine and then just that else.

3317
01:26:38,950 --> 01:26:39,950
And then city of study,

3318
01:26:39,951 --> 01:26:42,650
they find that they
fight whoever you know,

3319
01:26:42,770 --> 01:26:44,000
you could get them fights.

3320
01:26:44,150 --> 01:26:49,150
Look GSPs back GSPs back GSP versus
Nick Diaz is the perfect fight to make.

3321
01:26:51,470 --> 01:26:52,730
That's the perfect fight to make.

3322
01:26:52,820 --> 01:26:54,560
Cause neither guys fought in a long time,

3323
01:26:54,680 --> 01:26:57,890
neither guys in title contention
and it's a super fight.

3324
01:26:57,930 --> 01:26:59,630
This a super fight right out of the gate.

3325
01:27:01,670 --> 01:27:02,270
Very true.

3326
01:27:02,270 --> 01:27:02,720
Good point.

3327
01:27:02,720 --> 01:27:03,770
So Tucker,

3328
01:27:03,771 --> 01:27:04,940
watching him warm up,

3329
01:27:04,941 --> 01:27:05,301
man,

3330
01:27:05,301 --> 01:27:10,301
his striking looks really crisp to be
interesting to see and really well yeah.

3331
01:27:10,521 --> 01:27:12,410
Interesting to see him versus Sam.

3332
01:27:13,640 --> 01:27:15,800
But you can tell Sam's just
trying to line up a shot.

3333
01:27:15,801 --> 01:27:18,380
So Santa throw some hay makers.

3334
01:27:18,470 --> 01:27:19,140
Exactly.

3335
01:27:19,140 --> 01:27:19,881
The dude throws,

3336
01:27:19,881 --> 01:27:20,840
hey,

3337
01:27:23,340 --> 01:27:27,210
but he's at least keeping his
hands up for the most part.

3338
01:27:27,540 --> 01:27:28,560
They're starting to drop again.

3339
01:27:28,830 --> 01:27:29,610
It's a Cilia.

3340
01:27:29,610 --> 01:27:34,530
He's like famous for putting his hands
right about waistband level and just

3341
01:27:34,770 --> 01:27:37,050
launch and bricks your way.

3342
01:27:38,250 --> 01:27:39,870
He actually has a fist
underneath that beard.

3343
01:27:40,290 --> 01:27:42,240
I really think that that is the fight.

3344
01:27:42,390 --> 01:27:47,250
I really think that Nick Diaz versus
GSP is the fight because it's a super

3345
01:27:47,251 --> 01:27:48,084
fight.

3346
01:27:48,360 --> 01:27:50,400
Both guys haven't fought in forever.

3347
01:27:50,401 --> 01:27:53,730
Both guys are not ranked and
it's a fight you could sell.

3348
01:27:53,760 --> 01:27:54,060
Yes.

3349
01:27:54,060 --> 01:27:55,230
Like right out of the gate,

3350
01:27:55,290 --> 01:27:56,550
there's no repercussions.

3351
01:27:56,670 --> 01:27:58,590
But there's all show a
lot of money we made,

3352
01:27:58,770 --> 01:28:01,680
and I'm hearing rumors about
Eddie Alvarez Fight Nate Diaz,

3353
01:28:01,740 --> 01:28:03,660
but uh,

3354
01:28:03,900 --> 01:28:04,590
it was,

3355
01:28:04,590 --> 01:28:07,410
the reality of the rumors is
I'm only hearing them online.

3356
01:28:07,440 --> 01:28:09,540
So I mean they might be total bullshit.

3357
01:28:10,020 --> 01:28:11,820
Like I could probably ask,

3358
01:28:15,350 --> 01:28:16,183
you'd have to read online.

3359
01:28:16,200 --> 01:28:16,441
Yeah,

3360
01:28:16,441 --> 01:28:18,630
I have a direct line to the UFC,

3361
01:28:18,631 --> 01:28:20,430
but meanwhile I'm reading Instagram posts.

3362
01:28:20,460 --> 01:28:20,611
Oh,

3363
01:28:20,611 --> 01:28:21,444
for real.

3364
01:28:21,800 --> 01:28:22,740
Is this real?

3365
01:28:23,280 --> 01:28:24,270
Oh Shit.

3366
01:28:24,690 --> 01:28:26,040
I didn't know it was for real,

3367
01:28:27,630 --> 01:28:30,960
but I love that fight to Eddie
Alvarez versus Nate Diaz.

3368
01:28:30,990 --> 01:28:31,980
That's a good fucking fight.

3369
01:28:32,410 --> 01:28:33,243
Awesome.

3370
01:28:34,120 --> 01:28:36,310
There's a lot of good fights
that could be made right now,

3371
01:28:36,520 --> 01:28:40,780
but it seems like the transition between
[inaudible] and this new company,

3372
01:28:42,070 --> 01:28:42,461
you know,

3373
01:28:42,461 --> 01:28:45,070
between WME and the old guard,

3374
01:28:45,370 --> 01:28:46,091
it's like there's,

3375
01:28:46,091 --> 01:28:51,091
there's definitely been a transitionary
period where some things are as well as

3376
01:28:52,400 --> 01:28:53,233
you think you do it.

3377
01:28:53,770 --> 01:28:53,951
Yeah.

3378
01:28:53,951 --> 01:28:56,530
Like that Brooklyn card was a hard sell.

3379
01:28:56,531 --> 01:28:58,480
It turned out to be like
a really good fight card.

3380
01:28:58,840 --> 01:29:00,670
But the f the main event,

3381
01:29:00,671 --> 01:29:03,630
the featherweight about kind of
a hard sell for a lot of people

3382
01:29:05,330 --> 01:29:08,870
and we all know that that
title is just a place.

3383
01:29:08,980 --> 01:29:10,410
It's just a placeholder for Chris.

3384
01:29:10,500 --> 01:29:12,570
What people are mad that
Chris is getting a test,

3385
01:29:12,640 --> 01:29:13,230
uh,

3386
01:29:13,230 --> 01:29:14,070
not testosterone,

3387
01:29:14,100 --> 01:29:15,780
a therapeutic use exemption.

3388
01:29:16,470 --> 01:29:18,420
There's a lot of people that
are pretty pissed online.

3389
01:29:18,810 --> 01:29:21,420
And you're saying that you
saw it was manipulated,

3390
01:29:22,470 --> 01:29:23,610
but I don't think that's true.

3391
01:29:24,000 --> 01:29:29,000
I think that they've found that whatever
she's taking was the right thing to

3392
01:29:29,161 --> 01:29:30,900
take for whatever issue she's got.

3393
01:29:30,980 --> 01:29:31,813
Yeah.

3394
01:29:31,980 --> 01:29:32,761
They know everything.

3395
01:29:32,761 --> 01:29:35,040
They test you and they can
see everything in your system.

3396
01:29:35,050 --> 01:29:35,520
They're there.

3397
01:29:35,520 --> 01:29:36,353
They're not stupid.

3398
01:29:38,070 --> 01:29:42,140
It's going to be very interesting
to see what happens when Duran,

3399
01:29:42,141 --> 01:29:42,271
him,

3400
01:29:42,271 --> 01:29:46,800
he comes back if she's going to fight
Holly Holm for rematch or if they're going

3401
01:29:46,801 --> 01:29:48,000
to go straight to Cyborg,

3402
01:29:48,890 --> 01:29:52,200
but what the UFC is going to decide
cause cyborgs where the money's at.

3403
01:29:52,290 --> 01:29:53,123
Of course,

3404
01:29:54,090 --> 01:29:55,030
you know me.

3405
01:29:55,090 --> 01:29:55,980
Most people,

3406
01:29:57,210 --> 01:29:59,400
irregular folks don't know who Cyborg is.

3407
01:29:59,820 --> 01:30:00,900
She is scary,

3408
01:30:01,050 --> 01:30:01,980
but they'll know.

3409
01:30:02,130 --> 01:30:03,390
They'll know after that fight.

3410
01:30:04,890 --> 01:30:05,071
Yeah,

3411
01:30:05,071 --> 01:30:05,850
she's the,

3412
01:30:05,850 --> 01:30:06,683
she's this.

3413
01:30:07,830 --> 01:30:08,910
She's such a bad ass.

3414
01:30:09,390 --> 01:30:09,571
I mean,

3415
01:30:09,571 --> 01:30:10,201
I see you're at the gym.

3416
01:30:10,201 --> 01:30:12,570
She's fucking so tough and so hardworking.

3417
01:30:12,660 --> 01:30:13,680
She's at Ruca too,

3418
01:30:13,681 --> 01:30:13,981
right?

3419
01:30:13,981 --> 01:30:15,690
Isn't she training with Jason,

3420
01:30:15,900 --> 01:30:16,733
Jason Parillo.

3421
01:30:17,040 --> 01:30:17,221
Yeah,

3422
01:30:17,221 --> 01:30:17,560
she's,

3423
01:30:17,560 --> 01:30:18,393
she's,

3424
01:30:18,630 --> 01:30:20,100
that woman works so fucking hard.

3425
01:30:20,640 --> 01:30:22,880
She's always doing something
like running a marathon,

3426
01:30:22,920 --> 01:30:23,701
doing this and that.

3427
01:30:23,701 --> 01:30:24,180
It's like,

3428
01:30:24,180 --> 01:30:24,840
Jeez,

3429
01:30:24,840 --> 01:30:25,673
runs marathons.

3430
01:30:25,980 --> 01:30:27,870
She just did a half marathon
and then a couple weeks ago.

3431
01:30:29,250 --> 01:30:30,083
What was it?

3432
01:30:30,370 --> 01:30:32,020
Play Adrian and rocky,

3433
01:30:32,050 --> 01:30:34,270
that rocky three parody that an Duh

3434
01:30:36,460 --> 01:30:36,791
dude.

3435
01:30:36,791 --> 01:30:39,760
It's one of the funniest
sketches of all time.

3436
01:30:40,990 --> 01:30:43,360
And I though is playing
rocky on the beach.

3437
01:30:43,390 --> 01:30:45,180
It's that same as the got emotional.

3438
01:30:45,700 --> 01:30:46,810
Ooh.

3439
01:30:46,890 --> 01:30:47,351
And she's like,

3440
01:30:47,351 --> 01:30:47,651
well,

3441
01:30:47,651 --> 01:30:47,981
you know,

3442
01:30:47,981 --> 01:30:50,950
it's like really emotional
and Cyborg plays.

3443
01:30:50,951 --> 01:30:51,550
Adrian.

3444
01:30:51,550 --> 01:30:52,660
It's hysteric.

3445
01:30:52,661 --> 01:30:54,230
How funny is it there sand

3446
01:30:54,340 --> 01:30:55,173
this day?

3447
01:30:55,630 --> 01:30:56,860
It's like that he,

3448
01:30:56,920 --> 01:31:01,480
that character that had not
[inaudible] character is inexorable.

3449
01:31:01,510 --> 01:31:01,721
I mean,

3450
01:31:01,721 --> 01:31:02,260
that is,

3451
01:31:02,260 --> 01:31:03,430
he's connected to that.

3452
01:31:03,850 --> 01:31:04,031
I mean,

3453
01:31:04,031 --> 01:31:04,864
that is him.

3454
01:31:04,960 --> 01:31:06,130
That was always a goof,

3455
01:31:06,610 --> 01:31:07,810
like hanging around the gym.

3456
01:31:07,811 --> 01:31:09,160
It was always like fun.

3457
01:31:09,550 --> 01:31:10,061
To this day,

3458
01:31:10,061 --> 01:31:13,990
people think that I got in an argument
with a Brazilian jujitsu black belt about

3459
01:31:13,991 --> 01:31:15,640
weed did.

3460
01:31:15,641 --> 01:31:18,720
He really did come up to me and was
giving me a hard time about wheat.

3461
01:31:18,820 --> 01:31:20,350
I had a meeting with him yesterday.

3462
01:31:20,510 --> 01:31:20,841
We're,

3463
01:31:20,841 --> 01:31:21,674
uh,

3464
01:31:21,740 --> 01:31:25,300
we're thinking about doing an
enter the dragon parody with,

3465
01:31:25,320 --> 01:31:25,841
I call it,

3466
01:31:25,841 --> 01:31:26,980
enter the death knuckle.

3467
01:31:28,540 --> 01:31:29,373
Um,

3468
01:31:30,570 --> 01:31:33,340
what we will probably do it.

3469
01:31:33,630 --> 01:31:34,420
What we'll same

3470
01:31:34,420 --> 01:31:37,810
is he still doing that little talk show
that he was doing though when he would

3471
01:31:37,811 --> 01:31:38,710
sit down with people?

3472
01:31:39,240 --> 01:31:39,500
Oh,

3473
01:31:39,500 --> 01:31:39,920
Kenny from,

3474
01:31:39,920 --> 01:31:40,990
that was funny.

3475
01:31:41,210 --> 01:31:41,961
That was part of it,

3476
01:31:41,961 --> 01:31:42,741
that rocky sketch,

3477
01:31:42,741 --> 01:31:44,330
because every show is a talk show,

3478
01:31:44,540 --> 01:31:47,470
but he'd have a sketch that
start at each show on them.

3479
01:31:47,530 --> 01:31:50,300
The first one was the
Robert Dinero sitting with,

3480
01:31:50,301 --> 01:31:50,930
um,

3481
01:31:50,930 --> 01:31:53,150
Al Pachino in heat.

3482
01:31:53,660 --> 01:31:54,740
He did a scene where,

3483
01:31:54,890 --> 01:31:58,430
and Kenny Florian plays Al Pachino and,

3484
01:31:58,440 --> 01:31:59,273
um,

3485
01:32:00,330 --> 01:32:00,720
uh,

3486
01:32:00,720 --> 01:32:02,650
Hannah auto plays Robert Deniro.

3487
01:32:02,680 --> 01:32:03,610
That's a great sketch,

3488
01:32:03,611 --> 01:32:04,510
one of the greatest sketches.

3489
01:32:04,511 --> 01:32:05,830
Then he does a Josh Barnett one,

3490
01:32:06,180 --> 01:32:06,310
uh,

3491
01:32:06,310 --> 01:32:11,310
broke back mountain parody with her
natto and Josh Barnett in the woods,

3492
01:32:11,500 --> 01:32:12,550
one of the greatest of all time.

3493
01:32:12,790 --> 01:32:13,623
And then he does,

3494
01:32:13,660 --> 01:32:15,040
he really does the intro.

3495
01:32:15,041 --> 01:32:15,461
Another one,

3496
01:32:15,461 --> 01:32:18,130
he redoes the intro to
the incredible hulk show.

3497
01:32:19,030 --> 01:32:21,820
It's incredible because it
had not those David Banner.

3498
01:32:22,000 --> 01:32:22,900
And when he sees,

3499
01:32:23,190 --> 01:32:23,520
uh,

3500
01:32:23,520 --> 01:32:25,870
when he gets child support notices,

3501
01:32:26,110 --> 01:32:26,943
it

3502
01:32:27,910 --> 01:32:28,743
infuriates

3503
01:32:30,390 --> 01:32:31,223
it's

3504
01:32:32,860 --> 01:32:33,551
dude the hand,

3505
01:32:33,551 --> 01:32:34,690
not the La Ronda Shell.

3506
01:32:34,691 --> 01:32:35,860
Are you kidding me?

3507
01:32:35,861 --> 01:32:36,461
He's funny,

3508
01:32:36,461 --> 01:32:36,681
man.

3509
01:32:36,681 --> 01:32:37,450
Are you kidding me?

3510
01:32:37,450 --> 01:32:39,640
What's interesting is MMA gets bigger.

3511
01:32:39,700 --> 01:32:42,250
Like that character is
like more and more viable.

3512
01:32:43,120 --> 01:32:43,391
I mean,

3513
01:32:43,391 --> 01:32:44,770
that's a really good character.

3514
01:32:45,010 --> 01:32:45,491
He does.

3515
01:32:45,491 --> 01:32:45,790
Uh,

3516
01:32:45,790 --> 01:32:46,240
he,

3517
01:32:46,240 --> 01:32:46,630
he,

3518
01:32:46,630 --> 01:32:49,270
he's just a total d bag.

3519
01:32:49,600 --> 01:32:50,500
Um,

3520
01:32:51,640 --> 01:32:52,473
um,

3521
01:32:52,990 --> 01:32:53,823
person

3522
01:32:56,710 --> 01:32:59,040
round to Gavin Tucker.

3523
01:32:59,041 --> 01:32:59,980
Sam Cecillia.

3524
01:33:00,430 --> 01:33:02,020
Every race has d bags.

3525
01:33:02,200 --> 01:33:02,920
Every race.

3526
01:33:02,920 --> 01:33:03,721
Oh yeah,

3527
01:33:03,721 --> 01:33:04,470
you got him here.

3528
01:33:04,470 --> 01:33:05,170
You know,

3529
01:33:05,170 --> 01:33:06,260
what's the ratio of the lease?

3530
01:33:06,290 --> 01:33:07,840
Dieback I would say Canada.

3531
01:33:07,841 --> 01:33:08,980
If Canada was a race

3532
01:33:11,020 --> 01:33:11,853
race.

3533
01:33:11,940 --> 01:33:12,191
Yeah.

3534
01:33:12,191 --> 01:33:13,024
I don't know many,

3535
01:33:13,090 --> 01:33:14,260
many dieback Canadians.

3536
01:33:14,680 --> 01:33:17,770
I would say they have the less
assholes as far as countries.

3537
01:33:19,840 --> 01:33:21,160
I think that's the nicest country.

3538
01:33:21,460 --> 01:33:22,293
Oh yeah,

3539
01:33:22,780 --> 01:33:23,350
I would agree.

3540
01:33:23,350 --> 01:33:25,840
I would say Iceland never been.

3541
01:33:25,870 --> 01:33:26,530
Have you been?

3542
01:33:26,530 --> 01:33:26,801
No,

3543
01:33:26,801 --> 01:33:27,634
I'm just guessing.

3544
01:33:28,990 --> 01:33:29,201
Well,

3545
01:33:29,201 --> 01:33:30,070
there's so big.

3546
01:33:31,640 --> 01:33:33,940
I'd be like number one
with like strong men.

3547
01:33:34,540 --> 01:33:36,430
They're like the most
amount of those strong men.

3548
01:33:36,740 --> 01:33:39,370
There'd be kinky central banks
out or something like that.

3549
01:33:40,450 --> 01:33:41,261
Something like that.

3550
01:33:41,261 --> 01:33:42,280
Iceland kicked him out.

3551
01:33:42,340 --> 01:33:42,530
Yeah,

3552
01:33:42,530 --> 01:33:43,000
didn't they?

3553
01:33:43,000 --> 01:33:45,210
They arrested like a lot of bankers.

3554
01:33:45,211 --> 01:33:46,060
I decided to just say,

3555
01:33:46,061 --> 01:33:46,894
fuck yeah.

3556
01:33:47,040 --> 01:33:47,290
Well,

3557
01:33:47,290 --> 01:33:52,090
the revolution do that when there's 50
people and yet frozen it on a glacier.

3558
01:33:54,530 --> 01:33:56,470
You're burning whale bones to stay warm.

3559
01:33:56,620 --> 01:33:57,453
That's racist.

3560
01:33:58,360 --> 01:33:59,193
That's racist.

3561
01:33:59,860 --> 01:34:00,641
I don't think it is.

3562
01:34:00,641 --> 01:34:01,030
Yes.

3563
01:34:01,030 --> 01:34:02,800
You're allowed to make fun
of white people all day.

3564
01:34:02,801 --> 01:34:05,820
Nobody gives a fuck oil show.

3565
01:34:06,170 --> 01:34:06,640
I mean,

3566
01:34:06,640 --> 01:34:07,500
come on through the body.

3567
01:34:07,600 --> 01:34:09,040
Think about Mo,

3568
01:34:09,480 --> 01:34:10,390
I'm generalizing,

3569
01:34:10,391 --> 01:34:15,391
but a lot of black comedians start off
with the jokes like why people do this

3570
01:34:16,060 --> 01:34:17,230
and this is how white people do it.

3571
01:34:17,350 --> 01:34:18,640
And then a white man would be like,

3572
01:34:19,000 --> 01:34:22,480
but can you imagine if
white comedians did that?

3573
01:34:22,540 --> 01:34:23,830
Said this is how black people are.

3574
01:34:24,010 --> 01:34:25,360
Like any joke like that,

3575
01:34:25,361 --> 01:34:26,530
they couldn't even do one of them.

3576
01:34:26,900 --> 01:34:27,733
No,

3577
01:34:28,450 --> 01:34:31,510
you can use a black voice
every now and then in your,

3578
01:34:31,690 --> 01:34:32,471
in your routine.

3579
01:34:32,471 --> 01:34:34,660
I think maybe you have but not like in a,

3580
01:34:35,000 --> 01:34:36,550
it's gotta be fairly positive.

3581
01:34:36,940 --> 01:34:39,940
Well one of the weirdest notions of
people throwing around today is that white

3582
01:34:39,941 --> 01:34:42,340
people are the only
people that can be racist.

3583
01:34:42,341 --> 01:34:45,220
Then black people can't be racist towards
white people because they don't have

3584
01:34:45,221 --> 01:34:46,270
power over whites.

3585
01:34:46,600 --> 01:34:49,990
It is one of the most ridiculous
interpretations of the Word Racist.

3586
01:34:50,440 --> 01:34:51,730
It's so fucking stupid.

3587
01:34:52,210 --> 01:34:52,600
It's,

3588
01:34:52,600 --> 01:34:54,460
but it's something that
people are embracing.

3589
01:34:54,461 --> 01:34:56,080
Like you look at it
online and they're like,

3590
01:34:56,081 --> 01:34:56,471
yeah,

3591
01:34:56,471 --> 01:34:57,710
tell him stay woke.

3592
01:34:57,890 --> 01:34:58,310
Let

3593
01:34:58,310 --> 01:35:02,150
people as they look really believing
that you can't be racist and be black.

3594
01:35:02,180 --> 01:35:03,470
Like if you're racist
towards white people,

3595
01:35:03,471 --> 01:35:04,191
that doesn't count like,

3596
01:35:04,191 --> 01:35:04,371
well,

3597
01:35:04,371 --> 01:35:05,204
what is it then?

3598
01:35:05,450 --> 01:35:07,520
If you just don't like all white people,

3599
01:35:08,010 --> 01:35:08,340
it's,

3600
01:35:08,340 --> 01:35:09,440
it's gotta be racist.

3601
01:35:09,480 --> 01:35:09,691
No,

3602
01:35:09,691 --> 01:35:09,901
no,

3603
01:35:09,901 --> 01:35:10,011
no,

3604
01:35:10,011 --> 01:35:10,281
no.

3605
01:35:10,281 --> 01:35:11,010
It's nothing.

3606
01:35:11,010 --> 01:35:11,530
It's just,

3607
01:35:11,530 --> 01:35:12,140
it's just,

3608
01:35:12,140 --> 01:35:14,300
it's a free three stab at it.

3609
01:35:14,330 --> 01:35:18,140
Do you remember Dave Chappelle
would play the white newscaster,

3610
01:35:20,830 --> 01:35:22,050
remember when men see is stolen?

3611
01:35:23,190 --> 01:35:24,730
See it literally does the same care.

3612
01:35:24,970 --> 01:35:25,180
Yes,

3613
01:35:25,180 --> 01:35:25,510
he did.

3614
01:35:25,510 --> 01:35:26,300
He did.

3615
01:35:26,300 --> 01:35:27,110
Oh yeah.

3616
01:35:27,110 --> 01:35:29,120
Dave Chappelle was fucking furious.

3617
01:35:29,540 --> 01:35:31,100
She did the same character,

3618
01:35:31,340 --> 01:35:33,830
like literally stole the character,

3619
01:35:33,831 --> 01:35:35,270
put the wig on everything.

3620
01:35:35,330 --> 01:35:37,340
I didn't know that the best one,

3621
01:35:37,400 --> 01:35:42,400
the best Chappelle sketch
was when Chappelle did the
racist KKK guy didn't know

3622
01:35:42,951 --> 01:35:44,360
he was black because he was blind

3623
01:35:47,950 --> 01:35:50,510
and KKK member who was blind,

3624
01:35:51,320 --> 01:35:53,120
and then when it's fucking robe came off,

3625
01:35:53,180 --> 01:35:54,720
the guy in the audience's head exploded.

3626
01:35:55,280 --> 01:35:55,980
Neil.

3627
01:35:55,980 --> 01:35:56,270
Neil.

3628
01:35:56,270 --> 01:35:57,103
Neil.

3629
01:35:59,420 --> 01:35:59,721
Oh,

3630
01:35:59,721 --> 01:36:01,520
that was the best get show of all time.

3631
01:36:02,210 --> 01:36:03,043
That's the best.

3632
01:36:03,470 --> 01:36:03,890
I mean,

3633
01:36:03,890 --> 01:36:05,060
it was the shortest running.

3634
01:36:05,090 --> 01:36:05,990
He's only two years,

3635
01:36:06,350 --> 01:36:10,760
but I think Chappelle show's the post
fucking up and as a comedian man,

3636
01:36:10,761 --> 01:36:14,570
he can do sketch comedy and his
comedy is fucking among the basket.

3637
01:36:14,630 --> 01:36:15,470
Some of his shit.

3638
01:36:15,471 --> 01:36:17,030
It's like you can't get
any better than that.

3639
01:36:17,031 --> 01:36:17,540
Good.

3640
01:36:17,540 --> 01:36:18,950
He's got so many of those bits.

3641
01:36:18,951 --> 01:36:19,340
Yep.

3642
01:36:19,340 --> 01:36:23,150
Classic Bitch Shit you
could do right there.

3643
01:36:23,151 --> 01:36:23,984
Boom.

3644
01:36:24,230 --> 01:36:29,050
He crushes Dave Chappelle
crushes lies year after year.

3645
01:36:29,140 --> 01:36:30,050
He crushes.

3646
01:36:30,570 --> 01:36:35,140
Then we were watching a good fight and
he walked away from everything from from

3647
01:36:35,300 --> 01:36:36,133
50 million.

3648
01:36:37,040 --> 01:36:39,170
Do you know why he too much pressure?

3649
01:36:39,470 --> 01:36:39,801
No,

3650
01:36:39,801 --> 01:36:40,011
no,

3651
01:36:40,011 --> 01:36:40,221
no.

3652
01:36:40,221 --> 01:36:40,581
They were,

3653
01:36:40,581 --> 01:36:41,930
they were trying to change his act.

3654
01:36:42,230 --> 01:36:44,270
What was happening was he was well,

3655
01:36:44,271 --> 01:36:45,460
look at the inside of Sam's like,

3656
01:36:45,470 --> 01:36:45,920
you're right.

3657
01:36:45,920 --> 01:36:46,290
Oh,

3658
01:36:46,290 --> 01:36:47,123
it's nasty.

3659
01:36:47,270 --> 01:36:48,103
Um,

3660
01:36:48,110 --> 01:36:53,110
what was happening was they had a DVD
deal back when DVDs were real thing.

3661
01:36:53,380 --> 01:36:53,600
You know,

3662
01:36:53,600 --> 01:36:57,050
this is when you can make
money selling DVDs and this,

3663
01:36:57,590 --> 01:36:58,423
this deal.

3664
01:36:58,430 --> 01:37:02,000
Part of it was they wanted to
change the kind of sketches.

3665
01:37:02,001 --> 01:37:04,070
They didn't want him using
the word nigger anymore.

3666
01:37:04,071 --> 01:37:06,380
They wanted him to stop
doing certain sketches.

3667
01:37:06,381 --> 01:37:07,730
May just clean it up a little bit.

3668
01:37:07,760 --> 01:37:07,970
Yeah.

3669
01:37:07,970 --> 01:37:08,211
They'll like,

3670
01:37:08,211 --> 01:37:09,170
you could have it just as funny,

3671
01:37:09,171 --> 01:37:12,530
but cleaning up a little bit and Dave
just recognize what was happening and he

3672
01:37:12,531 --> 01:37:13,790
recognized the compromise.

3673
01:37:13,791 --> 01:37:15,740
He just didn't want all these
people telling them what to do.

3674
01:37:15,741 --> 01:37:16,310
He's like,

3675
01:37:16,310 --> 01:37:16,521
look,

3676
01:37:16,521 --> 01:37:17,870
we've made it so far.

3677
01:37:17,871 --> 01:37:20,960
It's so successful and so funny cause
you leave me the fuck alone and all of a

3678
01:37:20,961 --> 01:37:21,471
sudden you're saying,

3679
01:37:21,471 --> 01:37:22,790
well we can make more money if you just,

3680
01:37:22,940 --> 01:37:24,020
if you just listen to us.

3681
01:37:24,260 --> 01:37:24,800
And he was like,

3682
01:37:24,800 --> 01:37:25,633
fuck it.

3683
01:37:25,820 --> 01:37:27,170
Well and went to Africa,

3684
01:37:28,040 --> 01:37:28,690
went to Africa,

3685
01:37:28,690 --> 01:37:31,340
hung out in Africa for a little bit
and just realize like what am I doing?

3686
01:37:31,580 --> 01:37:34,970
And then from then on he didn't book any
gigs for a long time and he would just

3687
01:37:34,971 --> 01:37:36,110
show up and do gigs.

3688
01:37:36,380 --> 01:37:41,380
He would bring a portable speaker and
set up in a park in Seattle and people

3689
01:37:41,961 --> 01:37:43,130
would just gather round.

3690
01:37:43,190 --> 01:37:44,720
He wouldn't even let
them know he was there.

3691
01:37:44,870 --> 01:37:47,330
He didn't use social media
who just show up and he,

3692
01:37:47,340 --> 01:37:48,250
we started doing sets.

3693
01:37:48,460 --> 01:37:50,240
It's still to this day shows up places.

3694
01:37:50,360 --> 01:37:51,290
When I was in Denver,

3695
01:37:51,980 --> 01:37:53,270
I got offstage in Denver,

3696
01:37:53,510 --> 01:37:54,440
my second show,

3697
01:37:54,441 --> 01:37:55,980
Friday night I go into the green room,

3698
01:37:56,010 --> 01:37:56,843
Dave's there.

3699
01:37:57,270 --> 01:37:57,481
I go,

3700
01:37:57,481 --> 01:37:58,314
what are you doing?

3701
01:37:58,350 --> 01:37:58,681
He goes,

3702
01:37:58,681 --> 01:37:58,831
oh,

3703
01:37:58,831 --> 01:37:59,670
hey Joe.

3704
01:37:59,910 --> 01:38:00,151
I go,

3705
01:38:00,151 --> 01:38:00,961
do you want to go on stage?

3706
01:38:00,961 --> 01:38:01,290
He goes,

3707
01:38:01,290 --> 01:38:01,561
oh,

3708
01:38:01,561 --> 01:38:02,131
should I go?

3709
01:38:02,131 --> 01:38:02,964
Fuck yeah.

3710
01:38:03,000 --> 01:38:04,440
I grabbed him and I go out.

3711
01:38:04,441 --> 01:38:05,970
The audience was leaving and I go,

3712
01:38:05,971 --> 01:38:06,804
come back.

3713
01:38:07,110 --> 01:38:07,381
I go,

3714
01:38:07,381 --> 01:38:07,861
come back.

3715
01:38:07,861 --> 01:38:08,671
We're going to restart the show.

3716
01:38:08,671 --> 01:38:09,960
Dave Chappelle's here,

3717
01:38:10,110 --> 01:38:10,621
and they went,

3718
01:38:10,621 --> 01:38:11,454
what?

3719
01:38:11,580 --> 01:38:14,970
And everybody came back in and sat down
and went crazy and Dave went up and did

3720
01:38:14,971 --> 01:38:16,680
another 40 minutes
after the show was over.

3721
01:38:17,170 --> 01:38:17,971
But that's what he's doing.

3722
01:38:17,971 --> 01:38:18,840
Comedy just shows up.

3723
01:38:18,841 --> 01:38:22,800
Places just shows up after a show and
does it set to somebody else's office.

3724
01:38:22,801 --> 01:38:24,000
Really enjoying it.

3725
01:38:24,150 --> 01:38:24,331
Yeah.

3726
01:38:24,331 --> 01:38:26,160
That's 100% of the fun.

3727
01:38:26,610 --> 01:38:27,301
It's all fun.

3728
01:38:27,301 --> 01:38:28,410
He's just doing the fun shit.

3729
01:38:28,440 --> 01:38:28,810
Exactly.

3730
01:38:28,810 --> 01:38:30,360
When shit is not having a schedule,

3731
01:38:30,361 --> 01:38:32,220
the function is doing it
when you feel like it,

3732
01:38:32,221 --> 01:38:34,830
because there's definitely
times you don't feel like it,

3733
01:38:34,831 --> 01:38:35,730
but it's time to do it,

3734
01:38:35,731 --> 01:38:36,600
but you don't feel like it.

3735
01:38:36,630 --> 01:38:36,781
Well,

3736
01:38:36,781 --> 01:38:38,040
he's doing some specials.

3737
01:38:38,280 --> 01:38:39,420
He got a deal with Netflix.

3738
01:38:39,421 --> 01:38:40,620
He's going to do some specials.

3739
01:38:40,790 --> 01:38:41,623
Oh,

3740
01:38:42,660 --> 01:38:44,250
Netflix is going off to him.

3741
01:38:44,370 --> 01:38:45,750
They got him on a special.

3742
01:38:45,751 --> 01:38:47,320
Chris stand up special.

3743
01:38:47,650 --> 01:38:48,010
Ooh.

3744
01:38:48,010 --> 01:38:48,570
Yeah,

3745
01:38:48,570 --> 01:38:49,403
that's going to be awesome.

3746
01:38:49,460 --> 01:38:49,620
Oh,

3747
01:38:49,620 --> 01:38:50,550
it's going to be a main number.

3748
01:38:50,551 --> 01:38:51,121
Netflix,

3749
01:38:51,121 --> 01:38:51,990
he's to suck.

3750
01:38:52,200 --> 01:38:53,010
There was nothing on it.

3751
01:38:53,010 --> 01:38:53,730
You remember that?

3752
01:38:53,730 --> 01:38:58,260
How you get it for eight bucks and it
sucked and you've cancelled that shit.

3753
01:38:58,261 --> 01:39:00,690
Everybody cancel that and you're like,

3754
01:39:00,691 --> 01:39:00,961
okay.

3755
01:39:00,961 --> 01:39:02,990
They cope of documentary.

3756
01:39:03,300 --> 01:39:05,340
Like should we keep it
for the documentaries?

3757
01:39:05,341 --> 01:39:07,050
And then you end up just
fucking canceling it.

3758
01:39:07,410 --> 01:39:08,241
I never know.

3759
01:39:08,241 --> 01:39:08,940
It's awesome.

3760
01:39:08,940 --> 01:39:13,410
I never watched it until a few years ago
and that was the best shit I was on it.

3761
01:39:13,440 --> 01:39:14,670
Who Watches regular TV?

3762
01:39:14,700 --> 01:39:18,230
I had a Netflix special in 2005 that,

3763
01:39:18,231 --> 01:39:18,600
uh,

3764
01:39:18,600 --> 01:39:19,530
Joe Rogan live.

3765
01:39:19,560 --> 01:39:20,460
That was Netflix.

3766
01:39:20,700 --> 01:39:21,001
Damn,

3767
01:39:21,001 --> 01:39:21,834
that's right.

3768
01:39:22,440 --> 01:39:24,480
2005 and I wasn't watching Netflix.

3769
01:39:24,480 --> 01:39:24,811
I was like,

3770
01:39:24,811 --> 01:39:25,081
Oh yeah,

3771
01:39:25,081 --> 01:39:26,880
you want to do a special on Netflix?

3772
01:39:26,881 --> 01:39:27,714
I'll do it.

3773
01:39:28,140 --> 01:39:28,501
I mean,

3774
01:39:28,501 --> 01:39:30,330
nobody saw it on Netflix back then.

3775
01:39:30,331 --> 01:39:33,270
Nobody had Netflix and
they sold it to showtime.

3776
01:39:33,271 --> 01:39:33,510
I'm like,

3777
01:39:33,510 --> 01:39:33,751
oh,

3778
01:39:33,751 --> 01:39:34,584
finally.

3779
01:39:34,890 --> 01:39:36,660
It's the Netflix revolution.

3780
01:39:36,870 --> 01:39:37,021
Oh,

3781
01:39:37,021 --> 01:39:37,854
it is now.

3782
01:39:38,040 --> 01:39:39,330
Now it's off the charts,

3783
01:39:39,331 --> 01:39:39,511
man.

3784
01:39:39,511 --> 01:39:40,171
You know what I've been watching.

3785
01:39:40,171 --> 01:39:41,970
I told you untold history
of the United States,

3786
01:39:42,360 --> 01:39:43,710
that Oliver Stone documentary.

3787
01:39:43,830 --> 01:39:44,250
Whoa.

3788
01:39:44,250 --> 01:39:45,030
Have you seen it?

3789
01:39:45,030 --> 01:39:45,420
No.

3790
01:39:45,420 --> 01:39:46,253
You gotta watch it.

3791
01:39:46,470 --> 01:39:46,770
It's,

3792
01:39:46,770 --> 01:39:50,190
it's the rabbit hole is
deep and it's so crazy.

3793
01:39:50,191 --> 01:39:50,850
What's it called?

3794
01:39:50,850 --> 01:39:52,920
The untold history of the United States.

3795
01:39:52,950 --> 01:39:53,850
It's amazing.

3796
01:39:53,910 --> 01:39:54,780
It's Oliver Stone.

3797
01:39:55,200 --> 01:39:56,033
That's it.

3798
01:39:56,100 --> 01:39:59,370
Netflix came from $40
in late fees on Nepal.

3799
01:39:59,430 --> 01:40:00,241
13 rental.

3800
01:40:00,241 --> 01:40:01,140
That's hilarious.

3801
01:40:01,530 --> 01:40:02,760
That's where the idea came from.

3802
01:40:03,620 --> 01:40:04,453
Wow.

3803
01:40:04,500 --> 01:40:04,681
Yeah.

3804
01:40:04,681 --> 01:40:05,520
Netflix is awesome,

3805
01:40:05,521 --> 01:40:05,791
man.

3806
01:40:05,791 --> 01:40:06,990
And it's changing the game.

3807
01:40:07,050 --> 01:40:09,300
I'm so deep into house of cards now.

3808
01:40:09,510 --> 01:40:11,160
I'm on the third season of house of cards.

3809
01:40:11,160 --> 01:40:12,780
Holy Shit is started.

3810
01:40:12,781 --> 01:40:14,550
It watched like seven episodes and I,

3811
01:40:14,630 --> 01:40:17,670
I lost it that sometimes
you lose it and it's good.

3812
01:40:17,671 --> 01:40:18,471
And he'd go back to a,

3813
01:40:18,471 --> 01:40:19,720
I'll probably go back to the Ventura.

3814
01:40:19,721 --> 01:40:20,900
I forgot the whole thing now.

3815
01:40:21,120 --> 01:40:21,953
Yeah,

3816
01:40:22,230 --> 01:40:23,063
I hear you.

3817
01:40:24,180 --> 01:40:24,391
Yeah,

3818
01:40:24,391 --> 01:40:24,751
I was,

3819
01:40:24,751 --> 01:40:25,260
uh,

3820
01:40:25,260 --> 01:40:26,430
I got to go back to narcos.

3821
01:40:26,431 --> 01:40:27,690
I haven't finished season two.

3822
01:40:27,780 --> 01:40:28,250
Oh Shit.

3823
01:40:28,250 --> 01:40:29,190
I'm on that one.

3824
01:40:29,370 --> 01:40:30,300
I'm on that show.

3825
01:40:30,320 --> 01:40:30,910
So good.

3826
01:40:30,910 --> 01:40:31,740
So good.

3827
01:40:31,740 --> 01:40:33,300
I just finished Westworld.

3828
01:40:33,570 --> 01:40:33,901
Oh,

3829
01:40:33,901 --> 01:40:34,351
I love that.

3830
01:40:34,351 --> 01:40:34,921
But West roads,

3831
01:40:34,921 --> 01:40:35,431
amazing.

3832
01:40:35,431 --> 01:40:37,500
Love that show a show.

3833
01:40:37,960 --> 01:40:39,560
And he was kind of weird.

3834
01:40:40,660 --> 01:40:42,120
Funny as I'm watching,

3835
01:40:44,370 --> 01:40:46,050
I'm watching this and I'm thinking,

3836
01:40:46,410 --> 01:40:47,101
damn,

3837
01:40:47,101 --> 01:40:47,970
I swear to God.

3838
01:40:47,971 --> 01:40:52,800
I'm thinking Tate would be
perfect for the seeds he pops out.

3839
01:40:55,000 --> 01:40:58,030
I must've seen Instagram
posts from a long time ago,

3840
01:40:58,031 --> 01:40:59,860
but I swear I saw the scene.

3841
01:40:59,861 --> 01:41:01,030
I'm like damn,

3842
01:41:01,031 --> 01:41:01,420
Tate's.

3843
01:41:01,420 --> 01:41:06,010
Got The perfect look for
for this show and boom,

3844
01:41:06,011 --> 01:41:06,700
there he is.

3845
01:41:06,700 --> 01:41:07,533
There he is.

3846
01:41:07,960 --> 01:41:08,800
That's hilarious.

3847
01:41:09,520 --> 01:41:10,360
Sam Cecillia

3848
01:41:11,840 --> 01:41:12,673
[inaudible]

3849
01:41:14,180 --> 01:41:14,810
Tate

3850
01:41:14,810 --> 01:41:18,080
is probably one of the most successful
character actors in the business right

3851
01:41:18,081 --> 01:41:18,590
now.

3852
01:41:18,590 --> 01:41:18,720
Yeah,

3853
01:41:18,720 --> 01:41:19,553
he's in everything.

3854
01:41:21,900 --> 01:41:23,660
I remember when I first
started seeing him a movies,

3855
01:41:23,661 --> 01:41:24,391
I like check,

3856
01:41:24,391 --> 01:41:25,224
take it out,

3857
01:41:25,530 --> 01:41:26,840
but now it's like ridiculous.

3858
01:41:26,870 --> 01:41:28,950
My God damn Tate again because it change.

3859
01:41:28,980 --> 01:41:29,311
Look at this.

3860
01:41:29,311 --> 01:41:30,480
He's going for a leg lock here.

3861
01:41:31,710 --> 01:41:32,543
Oh neat.

3862
01:41:33,800 --> 01:41:35,900
That's another thing that's going
to be interesting about GSP.

3863
01:41:36,080 --> 01:41:38,500
GSP has spent a lot of
time with John down her.

3864
01:41:38,710 --> 01:41:39,200
He's in,

3865
01:41:39,200 --> 01:41:40,580
he's in New York a lot.

3866
01:41:40,670 --> 01:41:44,630
It'd be real interesting to see if he
incorporates a leg lock game and it's also

3867
01:41:44,631 --> 01:41:47,390
going to be real interesting
to see with all the,

3868
01:41:47,420 --> 01:41:47,751
you know,

3869
01:41:47,751 --> 01:41:51,340
if anybody's going to be greased and when
they fight George and what kind of an

3870
01:41:51,341 --> 01:41:52,780
effect that's going to have that.

3871
01:41:52,781 --> 01:41:53,900
You're not seeing that at all.

3872
01:41:53,901 --> 01:41:54,621
And grappling,

3873
01:41:54,621 --> 01:41:54,920
Aria,

3874
01:41:54,920 --> 01:41:59,390
Eddie greasing and having an effect on
leg lock games or anything like that.

3875
01:42:00,680 --> 01:42:01,513
Um,

3876
01:42:01,610 --> 01:42:02,330
who knows,

3877
01:42:02,330 --> 01:42:03,740
maybe who knows.

3878
01:42:03,830 --> 01:42:08,830
People are complain about it or I'll
know in Ebi there's a rash guard rule.

3879
01:42:09,200 --> 01:42:10,140
I don't have a title.

3880
01:42:10,190 --> 01:42:11,150
You could wear anything you want,

3881
01:42:11,151 --> 01:42:11,451
shorts,

3882
01:42:11,451 --> 01:42:11,811
whatever.

3883
01:42:11,811 --> 01:42:15,950
But I think ultimately everyone's going
to have to wear tights and rash guards

3884
01:42:15,980 --> 01:42:16,551
no matter what.

3885
01:42:16,551 --> 01:42:17,690
Just so that there is no,

3886
01:42:17,780 --> 01:42:18,740
what's the rule now?

3887
01:42:18,760 --> 01:42:19,820
Like what can you wear now?

3888
01:42:20,120 --> 01:42:20,953
You wear shorts,

3889
01:42:20,990 --> 01:42:22,150
you can wear shorts anyway,

3890
01:42:22,250 --> 01:42:22,970
anything you want,

3891
01:42:22,970 --> 01:42:23,690
shorts.

3892
01:42:23,690 --> 01:42:24,950
But you know,

3893
01:42:24,951 --> 01:42:29,951
just to eliminate any
possibility of gracing.

3894
01:42:30,910 --> 01:42:34,370
Now there's a lot of dangerous leg lockers
out there and there's a lot of people

3895
01:42:34,371 --> 01:42:35,810
that are really concerned about them.

3896
01:42:36,110 --> 01:42:36,950
And you know,

3897
01:42:36,951 --> 01:42:40,070
I'm not saying this guy
grease their legs or that guy.

3898
01:42:40,550 --> 01:42:40,821
Uh,

3899
01:42:40,821 --> 01:42:41,720
I'm just saying it's,

3900
01:42:41,990 --> 01:42:43,190
it's really easy to do.

3901
01:42:43,250 --> 01:42:44,150
We're not checking,

3902
01:42:44,330 --> 01:42:44,661
you know,

3903
01:42:44,661 --> 01:42:49,460
so instead of coming up
with this crazy ass tasks,

3904
01:42:49,730 --> 01:42:51,050
let's just make it more spazz.

3905
01:42:51,060 --> 01:42:52,340
Most people to have no problem,

3906
01:42:52,341 --> 01:42:55,160
learn spats were spats and
then board shorts over it.

3907
01:42:55,490 --> 01:42:56,091
No big deal.

3908
01:42:56,091 --> 01:42:57,140
People do that all the time.

3909
01:42:57,450 --> 01:42:59,540
I just found it interesting
that in Nogi those Donaher,

3910
01:42:59,550 --> 01:43:00,630
her guys weren't wearing them.

3911
01:43:00,840 --> 01:43:01,111
I was like,

3912
01:43:01,111 --> 01:43:04,440
that's really interesting cause they're
all leg lock guys like Eddie Cummings,

3913
01:43:04,470 --> 01:43:04,780
Gary,

3914
01:43:04,780 --> 01:43:05,590
Tony Choice

3915
01:43:05,590 --> 01:43:06,190
you have to make,

3916
01:43:06,190 --> 01:43:06,610
you know,

3917
01:43:06,610 --> 01:43:06,820
um,

3918
01:43:06,820 --> 01:43:08,020
if you're going leg locks,

3919
01:43:08,510 --> 01:43:10,150
a lot of people don't.

3920
01:43:10,210 --> 01:43:14,050
They like the greasy leg war
because it increases their defense,

3921
01:43:14,051 --> 01:43:15,760
their ability to pull out a leg locks.

3922
01:43:15,761 --> 01:43:17,800
If they're going to go
into a leg lock paddles,

3923
01:43:17,801 --> 01:43:18,121
man,

3924
01:43:18,121 --> 01:43:18,954
they'd locked battles.

3925
01:43:19,090 --> 01:43:21,510
One little zig when you should
have zagged and you know,

3926
01:43:21,511 --> 01:43:23,530
you think you're on his
heel and he's got you.

3927
01:43:23,531 --> 01:43:24,070
There's,

3928
01:43:24,070 --> 01:43:27,940
it's so mother crazy.

3929
01:43:28,010 --> 01:43:29,470
The modern day leg lock game.

3930
01:43:29,740 --> 01:43:34,120
It's endless on its own with so endless,

3931
01:43:34,121 --> 01:43:36,610
everyone's got different
styles and different paths.

3932
01:43:37,000 --> 01:43:38,530
It's insane.

3933
01:43:38,560 --> 01:43:40,000
How elaborate it.

3934
01:43:40,310 --> 01:43:43,090
Do you see a that g match between uh,

3935
01:43:43,310 --> 01:43:44,750
Gary Tona in Aaj?

3936
01:43:45,810 --> 01:43:46,141
No,

3937
01:43:46,141 --> 01:43:50,380
I didn't see that carry tone and got
him in this horrific leg lock and age.

3938
01:43:50,390 --> 01:43:51,223
I didn't

3939
01:43:52,160 --> 01:43:52,311
it,

3940
01:43:52,311 --> 01:43:52,761
you see it?

3941
01:43:52,761 --> 01:43:53,080
Yeah.

3942
01:43:53,080 --> 01:43:53,913
Is his legs.

3943
01:43:54,200 --> 01:43:59,120
He got him in like a knee bar sideways
and he had his leg bent sideways.

3944
01:43:59,121 --> 01:43:59,380
It looked,

3945
01:43:59,380 --> 01:44:00,620
it looked awful.

3946
01:44:00,830 --> 01:44:02,390
See if he could find that general.

3947
01:44:03,180 --> 01:44:04,013
He didn't tab,

3948
01:44:04,280 --> 01:44:04,911
he didn't tap.

3949
01:44:04,911 --> 01:44:05,760
But John Danner,

3950
01:44:05,770 --> 01:44:07,910
I made a whole point about
how we should have tapped,

3951
01:44:08,330 --> 01:44:08,721
you know,

3952
01:44:08,721 --> 01:44:13,721
and he went on about how Gary tone and
tapped with that flying triangle to a

3953
01:44:13,860 --> 01:44:14,693
shoe face.

3954
01:44:15,080 --> 01:44:18,170
You know when the Carl's Jr on Sug?

3955
01:44:18,690 --> 01:44:19,360
Yeah,

3956
01:44:19,360 --> 01:44:19,850
three.

3957
01:44:19,850 --> 01:44:20,683
Yeah.

3958
01:44:21,410 --> 01:44:21,981
And then they,

3959
01:44:21,981 --> 01:44:22,341
you know,

3960
01:44:22,341 --> 01:44:23,100
he dumped on her,

3961
01:44:23,100 --> 01:44:27,470
made this big Instagram post about how
the importance of tapping and you know,

3962
01:44:27,471 --> 01:44:32,270
you see Aja not tamping while this
horrific leg lock has put on them.

3963
01:44:32,870 --> 01:44:37,160
And then Gary Tone and made a post on
Instagram about how we severely injured

3964
01:44:37,161 --> 01:44:37,780
him.

3965
01:44:37,780 --> 01:44:38,001
You know,

3966
01:44:38,001 --> 01:44:40,580
even though he won the bout
and didn't get the tap,

3967
01:44:40,581 --> 01:44:41,660
he severely injured him.

3968
01:44:42,290 --> 01:44:44,090
But just tap people.

3969
01:44:44,110 --> 01:44:44,510
Yeah.

3970
01:44:44,510 --> 01:44:46,130
Fuck Jesus Christ.

3971
01:44:46,131 --> 01:44:47,480
Don't let your shake get ripped apart.

3972
01:44:50,350 --> 01:44:51,183
It's up to them.

3973
01:44:51,230 --> 01:44:51,711
I know,

3974
01:44:51,711 --> 01:44:53,600
but I mean doesn't that
bother you like your,

3975
01:44:53,690 --> 01:44:55,820
your match with a boiler when
you're ripping his knee apart?

3976
01:44:57,230 --> 01:44:58,063
It didn't bother me.

3977
01:45:01,680 --> 01:45:06,680
Did you hear it cracking and habit
repin who were talking about it?

3978
01:45:07,550 --> 01:45:08,450
Oh,

3979
01:45:09,210 --> 01:45:10,370
what did he say?

3980
01:45:11,570 --> 01:45:12,351
I told him.

3981
01:45:12,351 --> 01:45:13,250
Did you hear that?

3982
01:45:14,990 --> 01:45:16,800
You pull out his knee and it's,

3983
01:45:16,801 --> 01:45:18,130
it's going crack crack.

3984
01:45:18,440 --> 01:45:19,273
And he goes,

3985
01:45:19,430 --> 01:45:20,121
I'm fine.

3986
01:45:20,121 --> 01:45:20,391
Yeah,

3987
01:45:20,391 --> 01:45:20,840
I'm fine.

3988
01:45:20,840 --> 01:45:21,561
And then another one,

3989
01:45:21,561 --> 01:45:22,394
pop pop,

3990
01:45:22,400 --> 01:45:23,233
but what about that?

3991
01:45:23,390 --> 01:45:23,751
And he goes,

3992
01:45:23,751 --> 01:45:24,351
I'm fine,

3993
01:45:24,351 --> 01:45:25,184
I'm fine.

3994
01:45:25,520 --> 01:45:25,940
I'm like,

3995
01:45:25,940 --> 01:45:26,510
okay,

3996
01:45:26,510 --> 01:45:27,343
let's go.

3997
01:45:27,960 --> 01:45:29,840
Hell yeah man.

3998
01:45:30,650 --> 01:45:31,483
He didn't give a fuck

3999
01:45:33,290 --> 01:45:34,123
man.

4000
01:45:34,580 --> 01:45:36,620
Apparently he never taps the leg locks,

4001
01:45:36,840 --> 01:45:37,190
you know?

4002
01:45:37,190 --> 01:45:38,780
So everybody that knows him,

4003
01:45:39,020 --> 01:45:40,340
they knew he wouldn't tap.

4004
01:45:40,370 --> 01:45:42,710
What do you think the inside of
his leg looks like now though?

4005
01:45:43,430 --> 01:45:48,430
Sometimes your leg can pop and it's
just like your knuckle cracking,

4006
01:45:49,190 --> 01:45:50,023
you know,

4007
01:45:51,140 --> 01:45:52,430
because he was,

4008
01:45:52,730 --> 01:45:54,020
I think he was walking,

4009
01:45:54,660 --> 01:45:55,160
um,

4010
01:45:55,160 --> 01:45:56,210
after the match,

4011
01:45:56,950 --> 01:45:57,320
you know,

4012
01:45:57,320 --> 01:45:57,591
you know,

4013
01:45:57,591 --> 01:46:02,480
he didn't seem to limp anywhere and I
think he was surfing a couple of days

4014
01:46:02,480 --> 01:46:03,313
later.

4015
01:46:03,360 --> 01:46:04,070
Uh,

4016
01:46:04,070 --> 01:46:05,630
so maybe it was just like,

4017
01:46:05,780 --> 01:46:07,970
it was just popping like a knuckle crack,

4018
01:46:08,430 --> 01:46:09,040
like,

4019
01:46:09,040 --> 01:46:11,110
or maybe he's just got
chewed up meniscus in there.

4020
01:46:11,111 --> 01:46:11,420
Anyone.

4021
01:46:11,420 --> 01:46:13,210
It's cracker hunching around.

4022
01:46:13,510 --> 01:46:15,130
Maybe there's a lot of people like that.

4023
01:46:15,131 --> 01:46:16,000
They just get used to it.

4024
01:46:16,001 --> 01:46:18,310
Like Bas Rutten is bone
on bone on his knees.

4025
01:46:18,320 --> 01:46:19,270
He just walks around.

4026
01:46:19,450 --> 01:46:19,931
Hey,

4027
01:46:19,931 --> 01:46:20,764
how are you?

4028
01:46:21,170 --> 01:46:21,731
I mean,

4029
01:46:21,731 --> 01:46:22,690
his knees are fucked.

4030
01:46:23,530 --> 01:46:24,880
He told me it's all bone on bone.

4031
01:46:24,881 --> 01:46:25,780
He's got no cartilage.

4032
01:46:27,020 --> 01:46:27,670
It's,

4033
01:46:27,670 --> 01:46:28,570
it's gotta be so much fun.

4034
01:46:28,571 --> 01:46:29,500
Waking up every morning.

4035
01:46:29,620 --> 01:46:30,453
He can't train,

4036
01:46:30,700 --> 01:46:31,533
can do anything.

4037
01:46:32,540 --> 01:46:33,430
I mean boss Rutan,

4038
01:46:33,431 --> 01:46:36,040
former UFC heavyweight champion of
the world still looks like a stud.

4039
01:46:36,160 --> 01:46:36,790
Yeah.

4040
01:46:36,790 --> 01:46:37,600
Can't train.

4041
01:46:37,600 --> 01:46:38,433
I can't do anything.

4042
01:46:38,560 --> 01:46:42,370
He's got one arm is one arm is all fucked
up because of his impingements in his

4043
01:46:42,371 --> 01:46:45,070
neck caused severe
atrophy on his right arm.

4044
01:46:45,430 --> 01:46:47,980
His right arm shrunk literally
to half the size of his left arm.

4045
01:46:48,820 --> 01:46:49,500
And uh,

4046
01:46:49,500 --> 01:46:50,610
he can't even lift weights with it.

4047
01:46:50,640 --> 01:46:52,380
I mean he's up to like 10 pounds a curls.

4048
01:46:52,620 --> 01:46:53,490
It's really kind of crazy.

4049
01:46:53,900 --> 01:46:54,630
You tell me.

4050
01:46:54,630 --> 01:46:55,740
Can't hold up a jug of milk,

4051
01:46:56,190 --> 01:46:57,330
like a jug of milk like that.

4052
01:46:57,480 --> 01:46:58,380
His arm would just fall.

4053
01:47:01,760 --> 01:47:04,750
Does the Interesting Fina
Tyron Woodley Wonderboy too?

4054
01:47:06,680 --> 01:47:06,981
Well,

4055
01:47:06,981 --> 01:47:07,551
I think the,

4056
01:47:07,551 --> 01:47:08,384
uh,

4057
01:47:08,900 --> 01:47:11,210
I think we're going to see probably
the same thing we did in the first one,

4058
01:47:11,330 --> 01:47:12,440
just to kind of a stalemate.

4059
01:47:12,750 --> 01:47:13,970
I don't know about that man.

4060
01:47:13,971 --> 01:47:17,030
I feel like if Woodley decides to take
him down like he did in the first round,

4061
01:47:17,210 --> 01:47:18,410
it changes the whole fight.

4062
01:47:18,411 --> 01:47:18,621
But it,

4063
01:47:18,621 --> 01:47:19,790
but is he actually going to do that?

4064
01:47:19,970 --> 01:47:20,270
Well,

4065
01:47:20,270 --> 01:47:23,390
he just decided not to in
the second fight or in the,

4066
01:47:23,391 --> 01:47:24,410
in the second round,

4067
01:47:24,730 --> 01:47:26,660
he just decided not to
for whatever reason,

4068
01:47:27,050 --> 01:47:31,640
but it wasn't like it wasn't available
to them as it was really weird.

4069
01:47:31,760 --> 01:47:32,650
And I asked him about it.

4070
01:47:32,660 --> 01:47:33,000
He'd say,

4071
01:47:33,000 --> 01:47:33,210
Ah,

4072
01:47:33,210 --> 01:47:34,850
I've no idea why I didn't take them down

4073
01:47:37,600 --> 01:47:38,433
Kevin Tucker.

4074
01:47:40,510 --> 01:47:42,550
It just seems to me that this guy,

4075
01:47:42,970 --> 01:47:44,560
you know what,

4076
01:47:45,240 --> 01:47:46,390
what happened in that fight?

4077
01:47:46,960 --> 01:47:47,590
But when,

4078
01:47:47,590 --> 01:47:49,570
when Woodley took them
down the first round,

4079
01:47:49,571 --> 01:47:50,890
he dominated them on the ground.

4080
01:47:50,891 --> 01:47:53,590
Just beat him up and it didn't
look like wonder boy had an answer.

4081
01:47:53,950 --> 01:47:55,330
It looked like he was
going to get smashed.

4082
01:47:55,331 --> 01:47:55,660
Yeah.

4083
01:47:55,660 --> 01:47:58,870
And then the fight change from the second
round on it became a kickboxing fight

4084
01:47:58,871 --> 01:48:00,010
and Woodley's still hurt him,

4085
01:48:00,160 --> 01:48:00,851
hurt him bad.

4086
01:48:00,851 --> 01:48:01,660
And the fourth.

4087
01:48:01,660 --> 01:48:03,220
But one thing that he took away,

4088
01:48:03,410 --> 01:48:07,780
it took away a big part of the kicking
game of Wonderboy cause Wonderboy didn't

4089
01:48:07,781 --> 01:48:09,670
want to kick and be ticking down by him,

4090
01:48:09,671 --> 01:48:11,350
be smashed on the ground like that again.

4091
01:48:11,650 --> 01:48:16,120
So he kept it standing
and kept moving back.

4092
01:48:16,121 --> 01:48:20,410
And forth for the waste and just sorta
like kinda point fighting with his hands,

4093
01:48:20,411 --> 01:48:20,950
you know,

4094
01:48:20,950 --> 01:48:21,520
that's what it seemed like.

4095
01:48:21,520 --> 01:48:24,190
It was more of that way that that's
how he's going to win that fight.

4096
01:48:24,460 --> 01:48:24,760
Yeah.

4097
01:48:24,760 --> 01:48:25,750
That's how everybody's going to,

4098
01:48:26,000 --> 01:48:27,370
he has to keep my distance,

4099
01:48:27,520 --> 01:48:27,940
you know?

4100
01:48:27,940 --> 01:48:28,231
I mean he,

4101
01:48:28,231 --> 01:48:28,451
his,

4102
01:48:28,451 --> 01:48:29,680
his inside game isn't bad,

4103
01:48:29,681 --> 01:48:31,240
but it's the thread of the takedown.

4104
01:48:31,280 --> 01:48:31,431
He's,

4105
01:48:31,431 --> 01:48:32,470
he's got no chance.

4106
01:48:32,670 --> 01:48:33,730
The timing of the inside.

4107
01:48:34,330 --> 01:48:34,840
I know.

4108
01:48:34,840 --> 01:48:36,010
And the power exchange too.

4109
01:48:36,011 --> 01:48:36,521
I mean you'd think,

4110
01:48:36,521 --> 01:48:37,354
oh how,

4111
01:48:37,450 --> 01:48:38,230
how much power,

4112
01:48:38,230 --> 01:48:38,480
you know,

4113
01:48:38,480 --> 01:48:39,313
tyrants got,

4114
01:48:39,440 --> 01:48:39,750
yeah.

4115
01:48:39,750 --> 01:48:41,050
Wonderboy could knock you out.

4116
01:48:41,170 --> 01:48:42,460
He can knock you out with Tyron,

4117
01:48:42,461 --> 01:48:43,780
could knock you out with one shot.

4118
01:48:43,810 --> 01:48:44,440
Yeah.

4119
01:48:44,440 --> 01:48:46,960
And Wonderboy most of the
time it's a bunch of shots.

4120
01:48:46,961 --> 01:48:49,090
I mean he can knock you out
clean if he catches you.

4121
01:48:50,920 --> 01:48:52,000
Especially with kicks.

4122
01:48:53,400 --> 01:48:56,260
It's just an interesting fight to
see who makes the right adjustment.

4123
01:48:56,410 --> 01:48:57,243
Exactly.

4124
01:48:57,670 --> 01:48:59,210
That's yeah,

4125
01:48:59,211 --> 01:49:00,250
cause then they're going to go,

4126
01:49:01,670 --> 01:49:02,980
I mean maybe do decision,

4127
01:49:03,220 --> 01:49:04,780
I would think just cause just kind of the,

4128
01:49:04,781 --> 01:49:08,710
how the style matchup is there two guys
that seem like they'll end up there but

4129
01:49:08,711 --> 01:49:11,380
I don't see a problem with that and I
think we're going to see a lot like who's

4130
01:49:11,381 --> 01:49:11,980
ever game camp,

4131
01:49:11,980 --> 01:49:13,390
game plan can really work this time.

4132
01:49:14,230 --> 01:49:14,441
You know,

4133
01:49:14,441 --> 01:49:15,490
just one of the massive do it.

4134
01:49:15,820 --> 01:49:16,653
Yeah.

4135
01:49:17,630 --> 01:49:17,890
Yeah.

4136
01:49:17,890 --> 01:49:19,180
What a crazy fucking sport.

4137
01:49:19,330 --> 01:49:20,080
It's just,

4138
01:49:20,080 --> 01:49:21,250
there's so many variables,

4139
01:49:21,251 --> 01:49:24,340
there's so many different ways to win
and it's what makes it so exciting.

4140
01:49:24,341 --> 01:49:26,470
But it also makes it so difficult to call.

4141
01:49:26,670 --> 01:49:29,620
I'll give you watching certain
fights like a boxing match.

4142
01:49:29,621 --> 01:49:31,530
We're watching certain
boxing matches and you,

4143
01:49:31,540 --> 01:49:32,870
you know how one guy fights?

4144
01:49:32,890 --> 01:49:33,101
No,

4145
01:49:33,101 --> 01:49:36,220
under the guy fights so you can kind of
figure out what's going to happen and

4146
01:49:36,221 --> 01:49:37,810
you'd be with reasonable certainty.

4147
01:49:38,260 --> 01:49:42,460
But with MMA half the time you don't
know what the fuck's going to happen.

4148
01:49:42,640 --> 01:49:47,640
Like half the time the best strategy for
Woodley be just to continue taking them

4149
01:49:47,951 --> 01:49:48,550
down.

4150
01:49:48,550 --> 01:49:49,383
Like relentless.

4151
01:49:49,670 --> 01:49:50,590
That right.

4152
01:49:50,680 --> 01:49:51,490
I would say shot.

4153
01:49:51,490 --> 01:49:51,940
Okay.

4154
01:49:51,940 --> 01:49:52,510
I don't know.

4155
01:49:52,510 --> 01:49:53,020
I would say,

4156
01:49:53,020 --> 01:49:54,190
well he can knock you out too.

4157
01:49:54,191 --> 01:49:56,290
That's thing about
Woodley is he can do both.

4158
01:49:56,500 --> 01:49:57,670
Wonderboy can't do both.

4159
01:49:57,671 --> 01:49:59,710
Wonder boy can't take Tyron Woodley down.

4160
01:49:59,980 --> 01:50:01,090
He's just not going to,

4161
01:50:01,120 --> 01:50:01,953
I mean he could,

4162
01:50:02,110 --> 01:50:04,930
he could wind up on top if you know,

4163
01:50:04,931 --> 01:50:08,110
like in the first fight with we went for
the guillotine was choking the shit out

4164
01:50:08,111 --> 01:50:11,650
of them and somehow or another Wonderboy
you got through it and it wound up that

4165
01:50:12,120 --> 01:50:14,110
w Wonderboy was on top.

4166
01:50:14,530 --> 01:50:15,370
That's possible.

4167
01:50:15,510 --> 01:50:16,000
Yeah.

4168
01:50:16,000 --> 01:50:20,170
But like shooting for a power double and
taken down Tyron Woodley like not gonna

4169
01:50:20,171 --> 01:50:20,381
happen.

4170
01:50:20,381 --> 01:50:21,070
Maybe.

4171
01:50:21,070 --> 01:50:23,860
I mean maybe it can happen
but it doesn't seem likely.

4172
01:50:24,700 --> 01:50:29,470
What's really likely though is Woodley
can take him down and what's also really

4173
01:50:29,471 --> 01:50:31,920
likely is Willie can knock
him out but wonderful.

4174
01:50:31,930 --> 01:50:32,980
I can knock them out too.

4175
01:50:33,010 --> 01:50:33,200
I mean,

4176
01:50:33,200 --> 01:50:33,491
wonderful.

4177
01:50:33,491 --> 01:50:34,450
What can knock people out?

4178
01:50:34,480 --> 01:50:34,811
He just,

4179
01:50:34,811 --> 01:50:35,644
it just,

4180
01:50:35,650 --> 01:50:38,440
he doesn't have the same amount
of horsepower that Woodley does.

4181
01:50:39,090 --> 01:50:40,060
Enact accuracy.

4182
01:50:40,061 --> 01:50:40,930
It's Pitts place.

4183
01:50:41,080 --> 01:50:43,480
Perfectly perfect time and
hit you with a couple of them.

4184
01:50:43,540 --> 01:50:45,610
His striking is so dynamic.

4185
01:50:45,611 --> 01:50:46,900
He can do so many different things,

4186
01:50:46,901 --> 01:50:48,220
especially off the front leg.

4187
01:50:49,000 --> 01:50:52,120
But Woodley's got that
one punch smash power.

4188
01:50:52,480 --> 01:50:53,080
Like there's that,

4189
01:50:53,080 --> 01:50:57,040
that video of the fourth round or would
the connects with a left hook to the

4190
01:50:57,041 --> 01:51:01,210
Chin and you see wonder boy's eyes
robot back in his head and he managed to

4191
01:51:01,211 --> 01:51:01,840
survive.

4192
01:51:01,840 --> 01:51:03,760
That's one thing we learned
about Woodley from that far.

4193
01:51:03,761 --> 01:51:04,780
Wonderboy from that fight,

4194
01:51:04,990 --> 01:51:06,580
that fucking dude's got heart man.

4195
01:51:06,850 --> 01:51:07,720
He can take it.

4196
01:51:08,500 --> 01:51:11,100
The fact that he didn't tap
in that gay teen like Woo.

4197
01:51:12,190 --> 01:51:13,060
That was horrific.

4198
01:51:13,260 --> 01:51:13,400
Yeah,

4199
01:51:13,400 --> 01:51:13,610
he,

4200
01:51:13,610 --> 01:51:14,041
he was in it.

4201
01:51:14,041 --> 01:51:16,060
He was in a couple of real
bad positions in that fight.

4202
01:51:16,180 --> 01:51:17,470
And you saw how tough he really is.

4203
01:51:18,040 --> 01:51:18,730
He's tough.

4204
01:51:18,730 --> 01:51:19,690
No doubt about that.

4205
01:51:20,140 --> 01:51:24,100
It's just going to be a matter of whether
or not he can avoid the takedown and

4206
01:51:24,101 --> 01:51:27,130
whether or not he can be effective
standing up and avoid the bombs.

4207
01:51:27,150 --> 01:51:27,983
Yeah.

4208
01:51:28,180 --> 01:51:30,940
But I was impressed with Woodley's
ability to fight five rounds too,

4209
01:51:30,941 --> 01:51:33,190
cause that was always the
knock on him that he's so big,

4210
01:51:33,191 --> 01:51:35,560
he's so muscular that he's not
going to have the endurance.

4211
01:51:35,561 --> 01:51:37,650
But he heard him in the fourth you know,

4212
01:51:37,820 --> 01:51:38,001
can,

4213
01:51:38,001 --> 01:51:38,351
interesting.

4214
01:51:38,351 --> 01:51:39,184
What's so funny?

4215
01:51:40,650 --> 01:51:41,483
He laughed.

4216
01:51:42,140 --> 01:51:42,973
We laughed.

4217
01:51:43,870 --> 01:51:44,980
The whole muscular.

4218
01:51:44,981 --> 01:51:46,060
I'm cardio thing.

4219
01:51:46,870 --> 01:51:47,590
It's funny.

4220
01:51:47,590 --> 01:51:48,423
Why is it funny?

4221
01:51:50,110 --> 01:51:50,943
I Dunno.

4222
01:51:53,070 --> 01:51:54,050
You're not even high.

4223
01:51:56,110 --> 01:51:57,310
He doesn't like it when you say that.

4224
01:51:57,370 --> 01:51:57,521
Oh,

4225
01:51:57,521 --> 01:51:58,151
he gets mad.

4226
01:51:58,151 --> 01:51:58,580
But,

4227
01:51:58,580 --> 01:51:59,530
but it's a fact.

4228
01:51:59,680 --> 01:52:00,490
Sorry.

4229
01:52:00,490 --> 01:52:01,323
What does this movie,

4230
01:52:02,230 --> 01:52:03,220
this is a,

4231
01:52:03,430 --> 01:52:04,060
I dunno,

4232
01:52:04,060 --> 01:52:06,760
collide fast and the furious 97

4233
01:52:08,410 --> 01:52:10,930
at some point in time they're gonna
have to stop Stephanie Hopkins in it,

4234
01:52:11,140 --> 01:52:15,910
so it could be fucking real shitty
Westworld's on that's on vacation.

4235
01:52:16,510 --> 01:52:17,560
Just got to make some money,

4236
01:52:17,561 --> 01:52:18,220
man.

4237
01:52:18,220 --> 01:52:18,491
God,

4238
01:52:18,491 --> 01:52:19,324
that shows good.

4239
01:52:19,660 --> 01:52:20,950
It's on vacation,

4240
01:52:21,130 --> 01:52:22,540
on hiatus.

4241
01:52:22,870 --> 01:52:24,760
There's almost too many shows nowadays.

4242
01:52:24,820 --> 01:52:25,870
There is by far.

4243
01:52:25,900 --> 01:52:27,220
I hear about new shit all
the time and I'm like,

4244
01:52:27,221 --> 01:52:28,210
I can't do it.

4245
01:52:28,240 --> 01:52:28,391
Yeah,

4246
01:52:28,391 --> 01:52:29,200
I can't do it.

4247
01:52:29,200 --> 01:52:30,033
At the time,

4248
01:52:30,280 --> 01:52:31,150
people are always telling me,

4249
01:52:31,151 --> 01:52:31,421
dude,

4250
01:52:31,421 --> 01:52:32,260
you gotta check out the show.

4251
01:52:32,261 --> 01:52:32,501
I'm like,

4252
01:52:32,501 --> 01:52:33,334
fuck you.

4253
01:52:33,340 --> 01:52:34,173
I like sleep.

4254
01:52:34,660 --> 01:52:34,931
Well,

4255
01:52:34,931 --> 01:52:35,764
it's,

4256
01:52:35,770 --> 01:52:37,240
it's fun to get distracted,

4257
01:52:37,660 --> 01:52:39,040
but at the end of the day,

4258
01:52:39,041 --> 01:52:39,761
that's what it is.

4259
01:52:39,761 --> 01:52:41,350
You can only have so many distractions.

4260
01:52:41,380 --> 01:52:42,213
Here we go.

4261
01:52:42,280 --> 01:52:44,310
Hector Lombard speaking
to various muscles.

4262
01:52:44,320 --> 01:52:44,990
Johny Hendricks.

4263
01:52:44,990 --> 01:52:45,111
Oh,

4264
01:52:45,111 --> 01:52:46,410
he's the freakiest of the freak.

4265
01:52:46,411 --> 01:52:47,590
Him and Yoel Romero,

4266
01:52:49,320 --> 01:52:50,560
same Olympic team here.

4267
01:52:50,561 --> 01:52:53,030
See where he works out
when Lombard works out,

4268
01:52:53,031 --> 01:52:53,960
everything is short.

4269
01:52:54,320 --> 01:52:54,821
Like his,

4270
01:52:54,821 --> 01:52:54,971
uh,

4271
01:52:54,971 --> 01:52:55,581
his chin ups.

4272
01:52:55,581 --> 01:52:56,510
He does Chin ups like this.

4273
01:52:57,960 --> 01:52:58,580
Everything is like,

4274
01:52:58,580 --> 01:52:59,030
it's not,

4275
01:52:59,030 --> 01:52:59,930
there's no long,

4276
01:52:59,931 --> 01:53:00,800
big motions.

4277
01:53:00,801 --> 01:53:01,970
Tricep extensions,

4278
01:53:02,000 --> 01:53:02,480
very short.

4279
01:53:02,480 --> 01:53:03,313
Everything is like,

4280
01:53:03,500 --> 01:53:06,080
not like full range of motion stuff.

4281
01:53:06,081 --> 01:53:07,760
Everything's like short distances.

4282
01:53:08,060 --> 01:53:08,450
Huh?

4283
01:53:08,450 --> 01:53:09,230
That's interesting.

4284
01:53:09,230 --> 01:53:10,063
I wonder why.

4285
01:53:10,130 --> 01:53:10,730
I Dunno.

4286
01:53:10,730 --> 01:53:11,270
You know,

4287
01:53:11,270 --> 01:53:12,200
just his,

4288
01:53:12,770 --> 01:53:15,800
his style of strength and
conditioning and working out

4289
01:53:19,810 --> 01:53:20,660
one 85,

4290
01:53:20,661 --> 01:53:20,931
man.

4291
01:53:20,931 --> 01:53:22,400
He's such a fucking Corolla.

4292
01:53:22,930 --> 01:53:23,420
What did,

4293
01:53:23,420 --> 01:53:23,660
well,

4294
01:53:23,660 --> 01:53:24,493
where's the training now?

4295
01:53:25,180 --> 01:53:26,013
He's att.

4296
01:53:27,130 --> 01:53:27,290
See,

4297
01:53:27,290 --> 01:53:27,621
look at that.

4298
01:53:27,621 --> 01:53:28,311
See how he's lifting.

4299
01:53:28,311 --> 01:53:29,144
Look,

4300
01:53:30,230 --> 01:53:31,190
everything is like,

4301
01:53:32,120 --> 01:53:33,020
he doesn't eat now.

4302
01:53:33,021 --> 01:53:36,650
He doesn't have like full range
of motion with a lot of his uh,

4303
01:53:36,710 --> 01:53:37,610
exercises,

4304
01:53:42,000 --> 01:53:44,270
former world champion and one of them,

4305
01:53:46,720 --> 01:53:49,660
he's a freak when he
knocked out Nate Marquardt.

4306
01:53:50,040 --> 01:53:50,410
Oh,

4307
01:53:50,410 --> 01:53:51,580
Jesus Christ.

4308
01:53:52,240 --> 01:53:52,820
It's amazing.

4309
01:53:52,820 --> 01:53:53,340
That mountain.

4310
01:53:53,340 --> 01:53:54,041
There it is right there.

4311
01:53:54,041 --> 01:53:56,080
It's amazing that Mark Ward
is still in there swinging.

4312
01:53:58,590 --> 01:53:59,080
Oh,

4313
01:53:59,080 --> 01:53:59,710
Paul Harris.

4314
01:53:59,710 --> 01:54:01,160
He beat the shit out of Paul Harris.

4315
01:54:02,080 --> 01:54:03,190
That was at one 72.

4316
01:54:03,191 --> 01:54:04,024
Right?

4317
01:54:05,710 --> 01:54:07,390
He's a fucking scary man.

4318
01:54:08,110 --> 01:54:09,760
It's just so strange.

4319
01:54:09,820 --> 01:54:13,510
This sport you get to see
inside of a few year period,

4320
01:54:13,960 --> 01:54:18,040
the guys rise and then
complete falling apart.

4321
01:54:18,170 --> 01:54:18,700
Yeah.

4322
01:54:18,700 --> 01:54:19,840
You just get to see

4323
01:54:21,730 --> 01:54:26,730
them at the peak looking their best and
then you get to see them just really

4324
01:54:28,931 --> 01:54:32,830
when you just hoping and praying that
they stopped doing it and it all happens

4325
01:54:32,831 --> 01:54:33,760
inside of two years.

4326
01:54:34,180 --> 01:54:35,590
It's like the music business.

4327
01:54:36,190 --> 01:54:38,110
It's worse though because
they're getting beaten up.

4328
01:54:38,140 --> 01:54:38,351
Yeah,

4329
01:54:38,351 --> 01:54:38,780
exactly.

4330
01:54:38,780 --> 01:54:39,613
They're

4331
01:54:40,510 --> 01:54:41,380
getting abused.

4332
01:54:41,830 --> 01:54:43,570
That is like the music
business in a way though,

4333
01:54:43,571 --> 01:54:43,781
right?

4334
01:54:43,781 --> 01:54:48,370
Like think of a big music act from like
three years ago that you can see at the

4335
01:54:48,370 --> 01:54:49,203
Candy Club tomorrow night.

4336
01:54:50,250 --> 01:54:51,760
Out of all the bands get signed,

4337
01:54:51,880 --> 01:54:56,650
95% of them get dropped
within by the third album.

4338
01:54:56,810 --> 01:54:57,643
They don't make it.

4339
01:54:57,900 --> 01:54:58,451
They don't make it.

4340
01:54:58,451 --> 01:54:59,470
Most bands don't make it.

4341
01:54:59,500 --> 01:55:00,370
Only the very,

4342
01:55:00,550 --> 01:55:01,420
very few Megan,

4343
01:55:01,421 --> 01:55:02,254
it's just like,

4344
01:55:02,350 --> 01:55:03,490
it's just like MMA.

4345
01:55:03,580 --> 01:55:06,700
Someone was telling me about chance
the rapper is that the dude's name that

4346
01:55:06,701 --> 01:55:07,150
doesn't have,

4347
01:55:07,150 --> 01:55:11,230
he's not signed to anybody is
selling out gigantic arenas.

4348
01:55:11,231 --> 01:55:11,950
Technically,

4349
01:55:11,950 --> 01:55:12,340
yes.

4350
01:55:12,340 --> 01:55:12,910
Technically.

4351
01:55:12,910 --> 01:55:13,700
What does that mean?

4352
01:55:13,700 --> 01:55:14,310
And he's got,

4353
01:55:14,310 --> 01:55:17,380
he's said he's technically quote
unquote at independent rapper.

4354
01:55:17,530 --> 01:55:17,950
Right.

4355
01:55:17,950 --> 01:55:19,870
So he's not technically on a record label,

4356
01:55:19,900 --> 01:55:22,840
but he's got great friends all over the,

4357
01:55:22,960 --> 01:55:24,040
all over the map.

4358
01:55:24,100 --> 01:55:28,630
Has agent is the biggest agent in the
music industry or was Kara Lewis one of

4359
01:55:28,631 --> 01:55:29,440
the biggest,

4360
01:55:29,440 --> 01:55:30,273
so it's,

4361
01:55:30,280 --> 01:55:31,780
he's got all the help
that everyone would need.

4362
01:55:31,781 --> 01:55:33,250
You don't need the
backing of a record label,

4363
01:55:33,251 --> 01:55:36,610
which was like lawyers and
promotions and all that.

4364
01:55:36,620 --> 01:55:37,510
You can do it all himself.

4365
01:55:37,720 --> 01:55:38,553
So the lawyer,

4366
01:55:38,560 --> 01:55:39,191
I mean the,

4367
01:55:39,191 --> 01:55:39,580
the,

4368
01:55:39,580 --> 01:55:41,710
the record label thing is
kind of useless nowadays,

4369
01:55:41,711 --> 01:55:42,050
right?

4370
01:55:42,050 --> 01:55:42,480
Yeah.

4371
01:55:42,480 --> 01:55:42,830
Yeah.

4372
01:55:42,830 --> 01:55:43,663
It,

4373
01:55:43,680 --> 01:55:44,140
it doesn't

4374
01:55:44,140 --> 01:55:44,970
help you anymore.

4375
01:55:44,970 --> 01:55:45,803
Yeah.

4376
01:55:46,560 --> 01:55:46,810
Yeah.

4377
01:55:46,810 --> 01:55:50,580
Just so amazing change in
the world with digital.

4378
01:55:50,790 --> 01:55:51,271
Amazing.

4379
01:55:51,271 --> 01:55:52,240
What happened with the,

4380
01:55:52,280 --> 01:55:56,100
I mean it started out Lars or
which all rich that I say his name,

4381
01:55:56,280 --> 01:55:58,500
he saw the writing on the wall with a,

4382
01:55:59,390 --> 01:56:00,450
that Napster shit.

4383
01:56:00,750 --> 01:56:05,750
He saw what was happening and he called
it first and then now you're seeing like

4384
01:56:06,601 --> 01:56:10,950
the business is almost a
completely different business
than it was 20 years ago.

4385
01:56:10,980 --> 01:56:13,500
It's all based on live a live performing.

4386
01:56:13,920 --> 01:56:14,753
There's no money in it.

4387
01:56:14,840 --> 01:56:15,001
I mean,

4388
01:56:15,001 --> 01:56:17,140
what does a person make from
record sales is nothing.

4389
01:56:17,630 --> 01:56:18,463
It's point.

4390
01:56:21,330 --> 01:56:23,160
You stars still make it.

4391
01:56:23,190 --> 01:56:26,040
They'll still make money
off of albums like this.

4392
01:56:26,041 --> 01:56:28,880
Kanye West just don't fuck
how much you think you makes.

4393
01:56:29,080 --> 01:56:30,330
They're filthy rich.

4394
01:56:30,810 --> 01:56:31,410
Of course.

4395
01:56:31,410 --> 01:56:32,490
Of course it's filthy rich.

4396
01:56:32,491 --> 01:56:33,990
But is he making money?

4397
01:56:34,020 --> 01:56:34,831
You're filthy rich.

4398
01:56:34,831 --> 01:56:35,664
So that's how I'm saying.

4399
01:56:35,820 --> 01:56:37,260
Is he making money from record sales?

4400
01:56:37,290 --> 01:56:39,450
Obviously it's filthy rich
because he's selling out arenas,

4401
01:56:39,720 --> 01:56:41,640
but is he making money
from record sales still?

4402
01:56:43,050 --> 01:56:43,883
That's a good question.

4403
01:56:45,330 --> 01:56:46,163
Does that make sense?

4404
01:56:46,680 --> 01:56:46,921
God,

4405
01:56:46,921 --> 01:56:48,000
this is a boring conversation.

4406
01:56:48,550 --> 01:56:51,450
I saw an article just the other day was
trying to find it right now to pull it

4407
01:56:51,451 --> 01:56:51,601
up,

4408
01:56:51,601 --> 01:56:54,840
but up it's just now saying
how a lot of pop music or uh,

4409
01:56:54,960 --> 01:56:59,960
people are charging a lot more for their
tickets now to 300 bucks on a lot of

4410
01:57:00,271 --> 01:57:01,104
their money back.

4411
01:57:01,630 --> 01:57:02,463
I'm sure.

4412
01:57:03,210 --> 01:57:03,421
Yeah.

4413
01:57:03,421 --> 01:57:04,400
I'm sure that's,

4414
01:57:04,410 --> 01:57:05,580
I mean you got to do something.

4415
01:57:05,650 --> 01:57:06,060
Yeah.

4416
01:57:06,060 --> 01:57:08,400
How else you going to pay
for your fucking mansions?

4417
01:57:08,820 --> 01:57:09,900
Bentley's all they do is to,

4418
01:57:09,901 --> 01:57:10,530
are now.

4419
01:57:10,530 --> 01:57:11,363
Yeah,

4420
01:57:11,370 --> 01:57:12,210
I'm sure man.

4421
01:57:12,410 --> 01:57:13,320
Of course you have to.

4422
01:57:13,530 --> 01:57:15,180
Everyone's getting back together now.

4423
01:57:15,330 --> 01:57:16,163
Shit.

4424
01:57:16,170 --> 01:57:17,610
See what happened with guns and roses.

4425
01:57:17,611 --> 01:57:18,900
Holy Goddamn Shit.

4426
01:57:19,320 --> 01:57:20,970
I ended up in Mexico City,

4427
01:57:21,290 --> 01:57:21,750
uh,

4428
01:57:21,750 --> 01:57:25,740
doing ebi the same time guns
and roses in Mexico City.

4429
01:57:26,340 --> 01:57:29,310
We went to go see him and man,

4430
01:57:30,120 --> 01:57:31,410
I was completely blown away.

4431
01:57:31,770 --> 01:57:32,910
They have so many hats.

4432
01:57:32,911 --> 01:57:33,610
I mean,

4433
01:57:33,610 --> 01:57:36,000
slashes up there looking like a god.

4434
01:57:36,030 --> 01:57:39,840
I was never the biggest guns and
roses fan when they came out.

4435
01:57:39,841 --> 01:57:42,300
I was all into slayer
and I was under darkness.

4436
01:57:42,390 --> 01:57:42,881
Aerosmith,

4437
01:57:42,881 --> 01:57:43,261
signs,

4438
01:57:43,261 --> 01:57:44,850
first farewell tour dates.

4439
01:57:44,940 --> 01:57:46,420
Oh Shit.

4440
01:57:46,470 --> 01:57:47,270
I go on for awhile.

4441
01:57:47,270 --> 01:57:47,820
It was hearing,

4442
01:57:47,820 --> 01:57:49,200
Oh shit.

4443
01:57:49,740 --> 01:57:51,270
They're all getting back together again.

4444
01:57:51,750 --> 01:57:52,261
I make money,

4445
01:57:52,261 --> 01:57:52,441
man.

4446
01:57:52,441 --> 01:57:56,040
Even I hear smashing pumpkins might be
getting back to the original [inaudible].

4447
01:57:56,050 --> 01:57:56,883
Gotta go see that.

4448
01:57:57,780 --> 01:57:58,640
Jamesy Hahn,

4449
01:57:58,770 --> 01:57:59,603
Darcy

4450
01:58:01,230 --> 01:58:04,500
smashing pumpkins never really broke up
and it's always been Billy Corrigan with

4451
01:58:04,501 --> 01:58:05,370
a different band.

4452
01:58:05,540 --> 01:58:06,373
Yeah.

4453
01:58:06,510 --> 01:58:07,530
So it's going to be him again.

4454
01:58:07,560 --> 01:58:08,940
So it's going to be the whole band again.

4455
01:58:08,941 --> 01:58:09,561
The original band,

4456
01:58:09,561 --> 01:58:11,010
that blue Corgan was going crazy.

4457
01:58:11,470 --> 01:58:12,970
I don't know my reading propaganda.

4458
01:58:17,100 --> 01:58:17,933
He's not,

4459
01:58:18,630 --> 01:58:19,051
I don't know.

4460
01:58:19,051 --> 01:58:20,100
I haven't heard that anyone can.

4461
01:58:20,101 --> 01:58:21,210
Conspiracy theorists now,

4462
01:58:22,010 --> 01:58:24,060
original smashing pumpkins lineup.

4463
01:58:24,090 --> 01:58:24,960
They're all fucking nuts.

4464
01:58:26,160 --> 01:58:27,720
Guy From Blink one eight two
is that you're talking about,

4465
01:58:27,930 --> 01:58:28,261
oh,

4466
01:58:28,261 --> 01:58:29,090
that's what I'm talking about,

4467
01:58:29,090 --> 01:58:29,460
right?

4468
01:58:29,460 --> 01:58:30,480
He's down with aliens,

4469
01:58:30,481 --> 01:58:30,661
right?

4470
01:58:30,661 --> 01:58:31,870
He thinks that feelings are,

4471
01:58:32,210 --> 01:58:32,920
what did he write?

4472
01:58:32,920 --> 01:58:33,241
Which one is,

4473
01:58:33,241 --> 01:58:34,310
this is Tom Delong.

4474
01:58:34,320 --> 01:58:35,153
He wrote a book.

4475
01:58:35,450 --> 01:58:35,821
What are you?

4476
01:58:35,821 --> 01:58:36,121
Right.

4477
01:58:36,121 --> 01:58:37,490
He thinks that they're visiting us.

4478
01:58:37,491 --> 01:58:38,730
It's got the doc daily basis.

4479
01:58:39,000 --> 01:58:39,211
Oh,

4480
01:58:39,211 --> 01:58:41,290
how about that fucking basketball player?

4481
01:58:41,650 --> 01:58:42,010
He was a

4482
01:58:42,010 --> 01:58:42,850
basketball player,

4483
01:58:43,120 --> 01:58:44,470
but things to world is flat.

4484
01:58:44,471 --> 01:58:45,850
Dinosaurs aren't real.

4485
01:58:45,910 --> 01:58:47,350
The unfortunate thing
too is he went to Duke.

4486
01:58:48,460 --> 01:58:49,780
He went to Duke Boyfriend.

4487
01:58:51,430 --> 01:58:51,821
Damn.

4488
01:58:51,821 --> 01:58:56,821
Johny Hendricks barely made one 85
105.5 Lombard one 82 interesting.

4489
01:58:58,270 --> 01:59:01,200
I wonder if he's thinking about
going down to one 78 lumbar.

4490
01:59:01,210 --> 01:59:02,770
It looks way more fresh.

4491
01:59:03,160 --> 01:59:03,611
Oh yeah.

4492
01:59:03,611 --> 01:59:04,251
Look in the bachelor.

4493
01:59:04,251 --> 01:59:04,560
Shit.

4494
01:59:04,560 --> 01:59:05,740
I'm just going to touch gloves.

4495
01:59:05,741 --> 01:59:06,574
Here they go.

4496
01:59:06,610 --> 01:59:07,443
Here we go.

4497
01:59:08,350 --> 01:59:09,183
Wow.

4498
01:59:09,430 --> 01:59:11,620
Joe Martinez instead of a w.

4499
01:59:12,130 --> 01:59:13,120
I wonder what's going on.

4500
01:59:13,540 --> 01:59:15,580
Buffers almost always at these events.

4501
01:59:17,440 --> 01:59:18,590
I wonder why buffers not there

4502
01:59:21,830 --> 01:59:23,390
just doesn't seem the same.

4503
01:59:23,391 --> 01:59:24,320
I like Martinez,

4504
01:59:24,321 --> 01:59:25,154
don't get me wrong,

4505
01:59:25,610 --> 01:59:26,490
but unless you hear

4506
01:59:29,210 --> 01:59:32,970
and you see him beat red screaming,

4507
01:59:32,990 --> 01:59:34,220
nobody gets to be public buffer,

4508
01:59:34,340 --> 01:59:35,480
some shiny ass suit.

4509
01:59:35,600 --> 01:59:36,433
He gets crazy.

4510
01:59:37,000 --> 01:59:40,100
They get to like hand tailored
suits made for specific events.

4511
01:59:40,380 --> 01:59:43,010
Like he had one made
for the UFC in New York.

4512
01:59:43,990 --> 01:59:44,780
Like it,

4513
01:59:44,780 --> 01:59:45,470
what was it two,

4514
01:59:45,470 --> 01:59:46,303
was it two?

4515
01:59:46,400 --> 01:59:48,310
Was it two o to o?

4516
01:59:48,470 --> 01:59:49,080
Yeah,

4517
01:59:49,080 --> 01:59:52,580
UFC 202 and it has the date and
side of it all embroidered and shit.

4518
01:59:53,230 --> 01:59:54,063
I played,

4519
01:59:54,290 --> 01:59:55,030
uh,

4520
01:59:55,030 --> 01:59:57,280
announcer like Bruce buffer slash,

4521
01:59:57,310 --> 01:59:59,590
Dj and an underground fight.

4522
01:59:59,790 --> 01:59:59,951
Uh,

4523
01:59:59,951 --> 02:00:00,340
it was,

4524
02:00:00,340 --> 02:00:02,860
it was never back down to straight to DVD.

4525
02:00:03,220 --> 02:00:03,580
Um,

4526
02:00:03,580 --> 02:00:05,110
but I played the ring announcer,

4527
02:00:05,111 --> 02:00:07,510
so I'm talking as the fights are going on,

4528
02:00:07,540 --> 02:00:10,030
I'm kind of a ring
announcer slash commentator.

4529
02:00:10,031 --> 02:00:12,490
Slash Dj and man,

4530
02:00:12,550 --> 02:00:12,980
it was,

4531
02:00:12,980 --> 02:00:13,840
I was horrible.

4532
02:00:13,841 --> 02:00:15,010
I was so bad in it,

4533
02:00:15,250 --> 02:00:19,030
but I did just try to do
what Bruce buffer would do.

4534
02:00:19,180 --> 02:00:20,013
You know,

4535
02:00:20,040 --> 02:00:21,220
I was like Bruce Buffer,

4536
02:00:21,221 --> 02:00:24,700
say this name and I was just
basically doing terrible Bruce buffer

4537
02:00:24,701 --> 02:00:27,190
impersonations and it's so cringe.

4538
02:00:28,170 --> 02:00:29,003
Here we go.

4539
02:00:30,780 --> 02:00:31,613
Oh boy.

4540
02:00:32,310 --> 02:00:33,390
Hector Lombard,

4541
02:00:33,510 --> 02:00:34,231
Johnny Hendricks,

4542
02:00:34,231 --> 02:00:39,231
four 50 54544503452 of the first
round if you want to sync it up.

4543
02:00:43,530 --> 02:00:44,251
This is huge,

4544
02:00:44,251 --> 02:00:44,620
man.

4545
02:00:44,620 --> 02:00:46,770
Acts are just so fucking explosive.

4546
02:00:46,771 --> 02:00:47,550
When you watched him,

4547
02:00:47,550 --> 02:00:49,950
it's like you're watching
it gone about to go off.

4548
02:00:49,980 --> 02:00:52,590
It's like a championship fight and
the distance that he that he can,

4549
02:00:52,710 --> 02:00:54,840
he can close his insane.

4550
02:00:55,050 --> 02:00:57,690
Well the question is like
how motivated as Johnny,

4551
02:00:57,720 --> 02:00:59,280
like how much did he prepare?

4552
02:00:59,430 --> 02:01:00,000
Is He,

4553
02:01:00,000 --> 02:01:01,350
is he back to training?

4554
02:01:01,380 --> 02:01:06,090
Like real hard all the time and how much
better does he feel at one of the five?

4555
02:01:06,091 --> 02:01:08,610
I mean maybe he's just back
to old Johnny Hendricks again.

4556
02:01:10,390 --> 02:01:13,260
I mean he doesn't look good physically.

4557
02:01:13,320 --> 02:01:14,071
Physically doesn't look,

4558
02:01:14,071 --> 02:01:17,760
it looks fat and unshaven
glad you said that.

4559
02:01:18,290 --> 02:01:19,200
Good inside leg kick.

4560
02:01:19,950 --> 02:01:21,630
I didn't say that and I
don't mean to be an asshole.

4561
02:01:21,660 --> 02:01:25,200
I just want to point out not
the body chamber amongst us.

4562
02:01:25,201 --> 02:01:25,470
Yes.

4563
02:01:25,470 --> 02:01:28,000
I think if he shaved the hair off his GSI,

4564
02:01:28,100 --> 02:01:28,933
you wouldn't be saying,

4565
02:01:28,940 --> 02:01:29,300
oh,

4566
02:01:29,300 --> 02:01:30,630
big knee by Hendricks.

4567
02:01:30,690 --> 02:01:31,860
He clipped him with that knee.

4568
02:01:32,340 --> 02:01:33,340
He clipped him with that knee.

4569
02:01:33,341 --> 02:01:34,174
That was a good knee.

4570
02:01:36,360 --> 02:01:36,721
Damn.

4571
02:01:36,721 --> 02:01:38,340
Johny Hendricks still in the mix here.

4572
02:01:39,890 --> 02:01:40,580
Interesting.

4573
02:01:40,580 --> 02:01:41,420
Very interesting.

4574
02:01:41,780 --> 02:01:46,230
You gotta remember Johnny Hendricks is
a fucking hell of a wrestler and he hits

4575
02:01:46,250 --> 02:01:46,940
real hard.

4576
02:01:46,940 --> 02:01:50,030
Well he was at one 70 knocking
people dead for a while.

4577
02:01:50,240 --> 02:01:52,610
But you haven't seen any
evidence of that lately,

4578
02:01:52,611 --> 02:01:53,780
which is really interesting.

4579
02:01:54,080 --> 02:01:55,580
Who moved away from that left hand though?

4580
02:01:55,581 --> 02:01:56,414
He looked good there.

4581
02:01:56,540 --> 02:01:57,111
Look good there.

4582
02:01:57,111 --> 02:01:58,490
And moving away from that left hand.

4583
02:01:59,130 --> 02:02:00,170
But what Lombard?

4584
02:02:00,171 --> 02:02:01,700
It's like one fuck up.

4585
02:02:02,870 --> 02:02:04,160
Just one fuck up.

4586
02:02:04,400 --> 02:02:05,330
And you go night night

4587
02:02:09,170 --> 02:02:10,670
and he's so hard to take down.

4588
02:02:10,690 --> 02:02:11,523
Oh yeah.

4589
02:02:11,560 --> 02:02:11,840
Yeah.

4590
02:02:11,840 --> 02:02:13,530
[inaudible] world champion right now.

4591
02:02:13,820 --> 02:02:14,031
Yeah.

4592
02:02:14,031 --> 02:02:15,020
He's Judah World Champ.

4593
02:02:15,410 --> 02:02:17,990
I believe he was a silver
medalist in the Olympics.

4594
02:02:19,550 --> 02:02:20,150
No,

4595
02:02:20,150 --> 02:02:20,960
that's um,

4596
02:02:20,960 --> 02:02:21,830
Yoel Romero.

4597
02:02:22,040 --> 02:02:22,551
What did,

4598
02:02:22,551 --> 02:02:22,910
uh,

4599
02:02:22,910 --> 02:02:24,650
did Lombard compete in the Olympics?

4600
02:02:25,010 --> 02:02:25,843
I think he did.

4601
02:02:26,030 --> 02:02:27,710
I do not think he medaled in the Olympics.

4602
02:02:28,550 --> 02:02:31,190
I think maybe either way be connected.

4603
02:02:31,550 --> 02:02:31,791
Oh,

4604
02:02:31,791 --> 02:02:32,620
Jesus.

4605
02:02:32,620 --> 02:02:33,480
Lombard is connected.

4606
02:02:33,520 --> 02:02:34,760
A big right hand over the top.

4607
02:02:37,490 --> 02:02:38,360
I'm pretty sure.

4608
02:02:38,650 --> 02:02:41,240
I know Yoel Romero was a
silver medal at the Olympics.

4609
02:02:42,770 --> 02:02:43,340
There's a,

4610
02:02:43,340 --> 02:02:46,070
there's a bunch of people that believe
that you'll over married through the

4611
02:02:46,071 --> 02:02:47,570
Olympics for money

4612
02:02:49,280 --> 02:02:51,730
lent to the huge crazy
conspiracy theories.

4613
02:02:51,930 --> 02:02:52,640
Yeah.

4614
02:02:52,640 --> 02:02:53,473
It's not mine.

4615
02:02:53,690 --> 02:02:54,523
CNN.

4616
02:02:54,830 --> 02:02:55,663
I could be,

4617
02:02:55,860 --> 02:02:56,810
it could be the library.

4618
02:02:58,010 --> 02:03:00,170
I have to hear all these funny,

4619
02:03:00,171 --> 02:03:00,441
funny,

4620
02:03:00,441 --> 02:03:01,840
funny stories about is my,

4621
02:03:01,900 --> 02:03:02,740
my wrestling coach.

4622
02:03:02,750 --> 02:03:04,480
There are Christians was on the,

4623
02:03:04,720 --> 02:03:08,570
on the Olympic team in the World Team
with Joe Warren and all those people.

4624
02:03:09,050 --> 02:03:09,531
So I just,

4625
02:03:09,531 --> 02:03:11,180
the like the funny shit
I hear about wrestling,

4626
02:03:11,181 --> 02:03:12,740
it's just for other animals,

4627
02:03:12,870 --> 02:03:13,790
the animals,

4628
02:03:13,791 --> 02:03:14,560
animals,

4629
02:03:14,560 --> 02:03:15,680
animals and savages,

4630
02:03:15,710 --> 02:03:16,670
they are savages.

4631
02:03:16,700 --> 02:03:18,260
They're the cornerstone of MMA.

4632
02:03:18,700 --> 02:03:19,533
It's,

4633
02:03:19,680 --> 02:03:24,680
that's one of the reasons why it's
like y'all Romero is so interesting is

4634
02:03:24,801 --> 02:03:28,880
because if you talk to real wrestlers
about Yoel Romero and he'll tell you he's

4635
02:03:28,881 --> 02:03:29,840
just a freak.

4636
02:03:30,440 --> 02:03:34,370
It's just such an incredible athlete
and we're getting him while he's still,

4637
02:03:34,610 --> 02:03:36,230
I mean he might be 39 years old,

4638
02:03:36,231 --> 02:03:41,231
but he's still able to put on shows
and move like a freak freak athlete.

4639
02:03:41,960 --> 02:03:42,261
Oh,

4640
02:03:42,261 --> 02:03:43,940
Johnny with the left
hand over the top there.

4641
02:03:44,780 --> 02:03:46,250
I mean that fight with Chris Weidman,

4642
02:03:46,251 --> 02:03:47,360
Holy Shit.

4643
02:03:48,560 --> 02:03:49,490
That flying knee.

4644
02:03:49,491 --> 02:03:50,000
I mean,

4645
02:03:50,000 --> 02:03:50,501
dude,

4646
02:03:50,501 --> 02:03:52,000
he does it like nobody.

4647
02:03:52,100 --> 02:03:52,421
Like who,

4648
02:03:52,421 --> 02:03:53,254
who else?

4649
02:03:53,330 --> 02:03:54,560
Who else fights like Kim,

4650
02:03:55,430 --> 02:03:56,900
who else explodes like that?

4651
02:03:56,930 --> 02:03:57,980
Take off half your head.

4652
02:03:58,310 --> 02:03:59,750
He's so scary.

4653
02:04:00,230 --> 02:04:03,460
He's so scary and just abuse.

4654
02:04:03,620 --> 02:04:05,350
So stretched stronger
than Johnny Hendricks.

4655
02:04:05,351 --> 02:04:06,184
Right back up.

4656
02:04:06,500 --> 02:04:07,790
Good defense by Hendricks.

4657
02:04:07,791 --> 02:04:09,920
Avoiding that left hand
hits him with an elbow.

4658
02:04:10,190 --> 02:04:15,190
This could be interesting if Lombard did
not expect Hendricks to last and this

4659
02:04:16,371 --> 02:04:20,420
fight goes into the second and third and
and Lombard starts to slow down a bit

4660
02:04:21,890 --> 02:04:25,830
and you also got to think Lombard is
coming off of a devastating knockout loss.

4661
02:04:25,850 --> 02:04:26,900
You got to remember that.

4662
02:04:27,030 --> 02:04:27,380
Who Do you,

4663
02:04:27,380 --> 02:04:28,041
who do you fight last?

4664
02:04:28,041 --> 02:04:28,874
Dan Henderson.

4665
02:04:28,910 --> 02:04:29,420
Oh,

4666
02:04:29,420 --> 02:04:31,280
remember he got hit with that back elbow.

4667
02:04:31,330 --> 02:04:32,360
He got an elbow guy.

4668
02:04:32,361 --> 02:04:34,820
He got fucking hammered when
he was on the ground too.

4669
02:04:34,850 --> 02:04:35,683
Dude,

4670
02:04:36,170 --> 02:04:37,220
that was a crazy,

4671
02:04:37,740 --> 02:04:38,130
he didn't

4672
02:04:38,130 --> 02:04:39,000
move for a while.

4673
02:04:39,660 --> 02:04:41,720
But then clenching with them.

4674
02:04:42,120 --> 02:04:42,780
Yeah,

4675
02:04:42,780 --> 02:04:43,710
it is interesting.

4676
02:04:43,800 --> 02:04:44,581
It is interesting.

4677
02:04:44,581 --> 02:04:46,380
And this is like Johnny Hendricks is game.

4678
02:04:46,381 --> 02:04:48,000
Johny Hendricks is a hell of a wrestler,

4679
02:04:48,670 --> 02:04:50,640
was really good at manipulating bodies.

4680
02:04:50,641 --> 02:04:52,110
You want to play clinch with him.

4681
02:04:52,260 --> 02:04:53,280
If Johnny's healthy.

4682
02:04:53,430 --> 02:04:56,760
You remember when he fought George
Saint Pierre and George's could not do

4683
02:04:56,761 --> 02:04:57,570
anything with him.

4684
02:04:57,570 --> 02:04:58,370
It was just picking door,

4685
02:04:58,370 --> 02:04:59,190
Jap,

4686
02:04:59,190 --> 02:05:00,000
throwing them around.

4687
02:05:00,000 --> 02:05:00,151
Well,

4688
02:05:00,151 --> 02:05:02,640
when George was trying to hold
onto a single and Johnny was like,

4689
02:05:02,641 --> 02:05:02,771
yeah,

4690
02:05:02,771 --> 02:05:02,971
yeah,

4691
02:05:02,971 --> 02:05:03,804
good luck with that.

4692
02:05:04,020 --> 02:05:05,010
Good luck with that leg,

4693
02:05:05,400 --> 02:05:05,530
man.

4694
02:05:05,530 --> 02:05:07,470
You're taking me down and was like,

4695
02:05:07,500 --> 02:05:09,000
I'm going to elite wrestler.

4696
02:05:09,001 --> 02:05:12,240
Like his level of wrestling
when he was in his prime,

4697
02:05:12,241 --> 02:05:13,260
his level wrestling.

4698
02:05:13,261 --> 02:05:16,770
This is as good as America has to
offer at many points in times like that

4699
02:05:16,950 --> 02:05:21,060
beautiful trip attempt by Lombard and
Johnny Hendricks makes it through.

4700
02:05:21,660 --> 02:05:22,471
Ooh,

4701
02:05:22,471 --> 02:05:23,250
interesting.

4702
02:05:23,250 --> 02:05:24,083
Here's the other thing.

4703
02:05:24,180 --> 02:05:26,130
Hendricks looks kind of fresh here.

4704
02:05:26,880 --> 02:05:28,260
He doesn't look like he's tired.

4705
02:05:28,290 --> 02:05:31,200
He might've gotten in real
good shape for this look.

4706
02:05:31,430 --> 02:05:32,430
End of the fifth round.

4707
02:05:32,431 --> 02:05:35,340
I mean for me to know because
you saw some bad fights from him,

4708
02:05:35,341 --> 02:05:35,820
right?

4709
02:05:35,820 --> 02:05:39,090
He saw some fights where he self admitted
that he only train four days a week.

4710
02:05:39,190 --> 02:05:39,871
The last fight,

4711
02:05:39,871 --> 02:05:40,950
he didn't look that good either.

4712
02:05:40,980 --> 02:05:41,780
It didn't look that good.

4713
02:05:41,780 --> 02:05:42,350
Magnified.

4714
02:05:42,350 --> 02:05:42,840
Yeah.

4715
02:05:42,840 --> 02:05:43,920
It was a real close fight.

4716
02:05:43,980 --> 02:05:44,813
Yeah.

4717
02:05:45,030 --> 02:05:46,110
That was a real close fight.

4718
02:05:47,040 --> 02:05:47,131
Yeah,

4719
02:05:47,131 --> 02:05:47,650
that was a,

4720
02:05:47,650 --> 02:05:49,200
and he didn't make weight
for that fight too,

4721
02:05:49,201 --> 02:05:49,660
right,

4722
02:05:49,660 --> 02:05:50,260
exactly.

4723
02:05:50,260 --> 02:05:52,140
And that's why he's up at one 85 now.

4724
02:05:52,440 --> 02:05:53,273
Tell you what though.

4725
02:05:53,310 --> 02:05:54,510
You go back to the one,

4726
02:05:55,020 --> 02:05:55,770
the um,

4727
02:05:55,770 --> 02:05:57,840
the Johnny Hendricks at
knocked out John Fitch,

4728
02:05:57,870 --> 02:06:00,330
the Johnny Hendricks at mark
knocked out Marvin Kampman.

4729
02:06:00,360 --> 02:06:00,631
Yeah.

4730
02:06:00,631 --> 02:06:02,430
And he was just throwing bombs,

4731
02:06:02,431 --> 02:06:02,940
man.

4732
02:06:02,940 --> 02:06:03,271
He just,

4733
02:06:03,271 --> 02:06:05,580
he like a death touch hit guys.

4734
02:06:05,581 --> 02:06:08,340
They would go flying it
slide back on their heels.

4735
02:06:08,370 --> 02:06:09,330
It was weird.

4736
02:06:09,390 --> 02:06:10,980
There was a couple of
knockouts that he had,

4737
02:06:10,981 --> 02:06:13,720
particularly Fitch and Kamin
whereas looked like he,

4738
02:06:13,750 --> 02:06:15,520
he had some super power.

4739
02:06:15,810 --> 02:06:20,790
Like he had some crazy over
handling just video game shit.

4740
02:06:20,820 --> 02:06:21,190
Yeah,

4741
02:06:21,190 --> 02:06:22,830
snap someone life from him.

4742
02:06:25,380 --> 02:06:27,270
But that's one of those things,

4743
02:06:27,271 --> 02:06:31,590
it's like I was super excited to see
fade or this weekend super excited to see

4744
02:06:31,591 --> 02:06:31,941
Faye dark.

4745
02:06:31,941 --> 02:06:35,700
Cause I'm always wondering
like when does a guy like that?

4746
02:06:35,760 --> 02:06:37,440
Like how much does he still have?

4747
02:06:37,620 --> 02:06:38,460
Like how much is that the,

4748
02:06:38,500 --> 02:06:41,220
how much he takes all this
time off he comes back,

4749
02:06:41,221 --> 02:06:42,054
it's going to come back.

4750
02:06:42,210 --> 02:06:45,090
Just like super pumped up
to fight like his fate,

4751
02:06:45,091 --> 02:06:47,190
Oregon to come back as this,

4752
02:06:47,250 --> 02:06:47,940
you know,

4753
02:06:47,940 --> 02:06:51,000
this version of who he used to be or
are we going to see the fade or versus

4754
02:06:51,001 --> 02:06:52,890
Maldonado that didn't look so good.

4755
02:06:53,030 --> 02:06:53,250
He,

4756
02:06:53,250 --> 02:06:53,920
he this,

4757
02:06:53,920 --> 02:06:55,260
the pictures of him with
his shirt off and stuff.

4758
02:06:55,261 --> 02:06:56,910
He didn't look all that fit well,

4759
02:06:56,970 --> 02:06:58,790
he never looked all that fit but blab,

4760
02:06:58,830 --> 02:06:59,220
same,

4761
02:06:59,220 --> 02:07:00,053
worse than usual.

4762
02:07:00,090 --> 02:07:02,970
Well one thing that I saw when
I saw the picture of the way,

4763
02:07:02,971 --> 02:07:06,420
and I noticed that as it looked to me
like a shoulders are pretty full to

4764
02:07:06,421 --> 02:07:06,691
sounds.

4765
02:07:06,691 --> 02:07:07,524
Okay.

4766
02:07:07,680 --> 02:07:10,590
I should probably stop saying he looked
strong to me is what I was getting to.

4767
02:07:10,620 --> 02:07:12,300
I you always fatal.

4768
02:07:12,301 --> 02:07:13,830
We're always carried a
certain amount of body fat.

4769
02:07:13,831 --> 02:07:14,640
Never heard him,

4770
02:07:14,640 --> 02:07:14,911
you know,

4771
02:07:14,911 --> 02:07:17,940
he's never ripped and he was the
scariest guy alive for a while.

4772
02:07:20,520 --> 02:07:22,170
Do you think he's the greatest
heavyweight of all time?

4773
02:07:24,570 --> 02:07:24,871
Yeah,

4774
02:07:24,871 --> 02:07:28,080
I kind of feel like you almost have to
give it to them for that era because it

4775
02:07:28,081 --> 02:07:30,210
was as someone that,

4776
02:07:30,270 --> 02:07:33,600
I mean literally I've watched
the sport my entire life.

4777
02:07:33,660 --> 02:07:33,821
Like,

4778
02:07:33,821 --> 02:07:34,050
that's,

4779
02:07:34,050 --> 02:07:35,350
this is the one thing I've looked to.

4780
02:07:35,470 --> 02:07:35,651
He,

4781
02:07:35,651 --> 02:07:35,741
yeah,

4782
02:07:35,741 --> 02:07:35,900
he,

4783
02:07:35,900 --> 02:07:37,870
he was at that time.

4784
02:07:37,871 --> 02:07:38,560
But I mean,

4785
02:07:38,560 --> 02:07:41,560
since then there hasn't been a heavyweight
that struck fear in and the people

4786
02:07:41,561 --> 02:07:42,220
like,

4787
02:07:42,220 --> 02:07:43,600
like we did maybe,

4788
02:07:43,601 --> 02:07:45,070
maybe Cain Velasquez a little bit,

4789
02:07:45,280 --> 02:07:47,800
but no one really cared for some reason,

4790
02:07:47,801 --> 02:07:50,380
even the changes kept getting
injured on fortunately,

4791
02:07:50,381 --> 02:07:51,700
but when he was at his best,

4792
02:07:51,701 --> 02:07:52,720
he was as horrific,

4793
02:07:52,730 --> 02:07:53,563
so scared.

4794
02:07:53,890 --> 02:07:57,940
But I just feel like it's
disrespectful to Fabrizio over doom.

4795
02:07:58,000 --> 02:07:59,590
Like realistically,

4796
02:07:59,830 --> 02:08:00,550
if we're looking at,

4797
02:08:00,550 --> 02:08:01,750
in terms of accomplishments,

4798
02:08:01,751 --> 02:08:02,830
you have to really consider,

4799
02:08:02,831 --> 02:08:04,740
like when did Verdomme Ketchum?

4800
02:08:04,990 --> 02:08:05,381
I'll go.

4801
02:08:05,381 --> 02:08:09,750
We completely disregarding how good
fade or was up until the time Verdomme

4802
02:08:09,850 --> 02:08:10,610
caught them.

4803
02:08:10,610 --> 02:08:11,590
Are we not giving,

4804
02:08:11,670 --> 02:08:16,670
doing the credit he deserves because v
for receiver doom has tapped out three of

4805
02:08:16,811 --> 02:08:18,010
the greatest of all time.

4806
02:08:18,160 --> 02:08:21,160
Tapped out Nogueira tapped
out fader and tapped out Kane.

4807
02:08:21,730 --> 02:08:23,050
So it's hard.

4808
02:08:23,170 --> 02:08:24,790
But then he loses the Steve Bay,

4809
02:08:24,791 --> 02:08:25,900
he gets knocked out by Steve Bay.

4810
02:08:25,901 --> 02:08:30,370
So then you want to like reestablish
or reevaluate and now he's fighting a

4811
02:08:30,440 --> 02:08:31,340
desanto sign.

4812
02:08:31,380 --> 02:08:31,810
Yeah.

4813
02:08:31,810 --> 02:08:33,580
Dos Anjos he's going
to fight those Angelos.

4814
02:08:34,030 --> 02:08:34,863
Yeah,

4815
02:08:35,200 --> 02:08:35,860
exactly.

4816
02:08:35,860 --> 02:08:36,070
So,

4817
02:08:36,070 --> 02:08:36,670
and I,

4818
02:08:36,670 --> 02:08:37,503
he's,

4819
02:08:38,000 --> 02:08:39,280
he's beat all the best people.

4820
02:08:39,281 --> 02:08:42,550
So I don't know from presales now
finding dos Anjos steep pay is finding

4821
02:08:42,590 --> 02:08:46,240
Dosantos dos Santos Santos Dosantos.

4822
02:08:47,650 --> 02:08:48,483
Yes.

4823
02:08:48,940 --> 02:08:49,880
No junior tuning.

4824
02:08:49,881 --> 02:08:50,561
Dosantos yes.

4825
02:08:50,561 --> 02:08:51,130
Sorry.

4826
02:08:51,130 --> 02:08:51,963
He's fighting.

4827
02:08:52,000 --> 02:08:52,541
He's fighting.

4828
02:08:52,541 --> 02:08:53,374
Steepbank okay.

4829
02:08:53,620 --> 02:08:54,340
Yeah.

4830
02:08:54,340 --> 02:08:55,173
That's crazy.

4831
02:08:56,290 --> 02:08:57,670
That's going to be another good fight.

4832
02:08:57,671 --> 02:08:58,540
Remember that first fight?

4833
02:08:58,541 --> 02:08:59,830
The first fight was super close,

4834
02:08:59,831 --> 02:09:01,090
but it was a crazy war.

4835
02:09:01,110 --> 02:09:02,020
Who the hell out of each other?

4836
02:09:02,080 --> 02:09:02,231
Oh,

4837
02:09:02,231 --> 02:09:03,064
it was awful.

4838
02:09:03,130 --> 02:09:03,640
Oh,

4839
02:09:03,640 --> 02:09:04,473
Ooh.

4840
02:09:04,660 --> 02:09:09,190
See Johnny Hendricks looks
to me way better here at
one 85 then he looked at one

4841
02:09:09,191 --> 02:09:10,300
70 his last two fights.

4842
02:09:10,330 --> 02:09:10,421
Oh,

4843
02:09:10,421 --> 02:09:12,250
we just clipped him with
the luck or right hand.

4844
02:09:13,930 --> 02:09:15,430
Pretty slick for a fat boy too.

4845
02:09:15,431 --> 02:09:16,264
And he looks good.

4846
02:09:16,330 --> 02:09:17,110
He looks good.

4847
02:09:17,110 --> 02:09:17,860
He does.

4848
02:09:17,860 --> 02:09:19,060
He looks down his feet.

4849
02:09:19,120 --> 02:09:20,080
He's lying to his feet.

4850
02:09:20,081 --> 02:09:20,830
He looks fit.

4851
02:09:20,830 --> 02:09:21,820
He looks durable.

4852
02:09:23,470 --> 02:09:24,580
He just looks healthier.

4853
02:09:24,610 --> 02:09:24,851
I mean,

4854
02:09:24,851 --> 02:09:26,350
he may be not look ripped,

4855
02:09:26,740 --> 02:09:29,020
but the ways performing looks better.

4856
02:09:29,200 --> 02:09:30,340
Like he's able to take it.

4857
02:09:31,630 --> 02:09:32,190
Look at that.

4858
02:09:32,190 --> 02:09:32,590
See,

4859
02:09:32,590 --> 02:09:33,790
he's still throwing bombs,

4860
02:09:33,791 --> 02:09:34,624
man.

4861
02:09:34,720 --> 02:09:35,920
His reaction time looks better.

4862
02:09:35,980 --> 02:09:36,720
It looks better.

4863
02:09:36,720 --> 02:09:38,370
It looks better at 85 to [inaudible].

4864
02:09:38,470 --> 02:09:40,000
Same thing I say about Calvin.

4865
02:09:40,150 --> 02:09:42,280
You look at the Calvin
that fought Tyron Woodley,

4866
02:09:42,670 --> 02:09:43,311
that Calvin,

4867
02:09:43,311 --> 02:09:45,940
it didn't make weight
and Calvin look tired.

4868
02:09:45,941 --> 02:09:47,170
He just doesn't look the same.

4869
02:09:47,320 --> 02:09:49,240
Then you'll get the Calvin and fought Tim.

4870
02:09:49,960 --> 02:09:53,380
The one fought Tim Kennedy was
a fucking world beater man.

4871
02:09:53,620 --> 02:09:57,100
Calvin gassed alum at one 85
is a god damn world beater.

4872
02:09:57,610 --> 02:09:58,780
He looks amazing.

4873
02:09:58,900 --> 02:09:59,591
I mean his,

4874
02:09:59,591 --> 02:10:01,630
his grappling defense was incredible.

4875
02:10:01,750 --> 02:10:04,930
And then he was light on his
feet and his hands were flowing.

4876
02:10:05,200 --> 02:10:05,891
His Chin,

4877
02:10:05,891 --> 02:10:06,724
his iron.

4878
02:10:06,880 --> 02:10:09,550
I mean at one 85 that
guy's fucking healthy.

4879
02:10:09,551 --> 02:10:10,331
And when he's healthy,

4880
02:10:10,331 --> 02:10:11,920
you get to see the real guy.

4881
02:10:12,220 --> 02:10:14,380
The real guy is super talented,

4882
02:10:14,560 --> 02:10:18,880
but we've been seeing the real
guy that smothered by weight cuts,

4883
02:10:18,940 --> 02:10:22,900
like real hard weight cuts and they
just take too much out of his body.

4884
02:10:23,440 --> 02:10:26,110
And I think you're seeing the
same goddamn thing here right now.

4885
02:10:26,260 --> 02:10:26,591
I mean,

4886
02:10:26,591 --> 02:10:27,970
he might still lose this fight.

4887
02:10:27,971 --> 02:10:29,740
Hector Lombard still a fucking beast,

4888
02:10:29,741 --> 02:10:30,520
right?

4889
02:10:30,520 --> 02:10:34,100
But this is to me like the best Hendricks
we've seen in a couple of years.

4890
02:10:39,880 --> 02:10:40,181
I mean,

4891
02:10:40,181 --> 02:10:41,920
and this is like a competitive fight.

4892
02:10:41,921 --> 02:10:42,041
Yeah,

4893
02:10:42,041 --> 02:10:42,640
he looks good.

4894
02:10:42,640 --> 02:10:44,200
Good left hand over the top.

4895
02:10:45,270 --> 02:10:46,360
It's actually when his head,

4896
02:10:46,550 --> 02:10:48,150
he's he and he's also a,

4897
02:10:48,280 --> 02:10:52,840
I think he's banking on the slow down
cause the slow down with Lombard,

4898
02:10:53,050 --> 02:10:56,050
especially if he thinks he's
got you hurt is a real deal.

4899
02:10:56,080 --> 02:10:57,190
Like with Neil Magni,

4900
02:10:57,370 --> 02:11:00,370
Neil Magni managed to
survive a helacious dorm.

4901
02:11:00,580 --> 02:11:01,211
Do you remember that?

4902
02:11:01,211 --> 02:11:01,450
Yup.

4903
02:11:01,450 --> 02:11:03,940
Helacious he survived.

4904
02:11:03,941 --> 02:11:04,601
And then Neil,

4905
02:11:04,601 --> 02:11:07,090
Maggie eventually one by
Tko he got on top of him.

4906
02:11:07,091 --> 02:11:10,210
He was beaten him down and Lumbar just
didn't have anything left to defend

4907
02:11:10,211 --> 02:11:11,044
himself.

4908
02:11:12,760 --> 02:11:13,870
So that was the second round wasn't it?

4909
02:11:15,700 --> 02:11:18,700
He almost finish him at the end
of one of one of the rounds.

4910
02:11:18,730 --> 02:11:19,071
Yeah.

4911
02:11:19,071 --> 02:11:20,500
And then he ended up
finishing him after that.

4912
02:11:20,520 --> 02:11:20,630
Yeah,

4913
02:11:20,630 --> 02:11:21,371
I think you're right.

4914
02:11:21,371 --> 02:11:25,390
I think it was the third round that he
finished him and it was just a crazy war.

4915
02:11:26,320 --> 02:11:31,320
What's going on and breaking them
up morning grabbing the fence.

4916
02:11:34,030 --> 02:11:36,340
So we're in the second round.

4917
02:11:36,370 --> 02:11:37,061
Second round.

4918
02:11:37,061 --> 02:11:37,841
What's the time?

4919
02:11:37,841 --> 02:11:38,980
Did they have the time backup?

4920
02:11:38,981 --> 02:11:42,760
What do got a minute left and
Lombard slowing down for sure.

4921
02:11:47,470 --> 02:11:51,820
It just seems like some of those
guys that have cardio problems,

4922
02:11:52,780 --> 02:11:56,050
a lot of it is related to the
actual style that they fight into.

4923
02:11:56,080 --> 02:11:56,590
Ooh,

4924
02:11:56,590 --> 02:11:58,030
Ni and punch

4925
02:11:59,650 --> 02:12:00,900
the style of Lombard.

4926
02:12:00,901 --> 02:12:05,170
He's like so sprint oriented and when
he has to adjust that style and then

4927
02:12:05,171 --> 02:12:07,480
become like a technical oriented fighter,

4928
02:12:07,930 --> 02:12:09,100
it's just not the same thing.

4929
02:12:09,101 --> 02:12:12,510
Like you're always on your heels in
that first round and you first round,

4930
02:12:12,511 --> 02:12:16,940
you're always getting away from this
just super athlete common Achoo this

4931
02:12:16,960 --> 02:12:17,740
swinging,

4932
02:12:17,740 --> 02:12:18,700
throwing lead.

4933
02:12:19,000 --> 02:12:19,450
Right.

4934
02:12:19,450 --> 02:12:22,990
But then in the second round
you get a regular fighter.

4935
02:12:23,020 --> 02:12:23,853
Yeah.

4936
02:12:23,860 --> 02:12:24,850
And this is what you're seeing now.

4937
02:12:24,851 --> 02:12:26,440
You're seeing Lombard skills,

4938
02:12:26,441 --> 02:12:27,850
which are still substantial,

4939
02:12:28,150 --> 02:12:31,240
but you're not seeing any evidence
of that freak athleticism anymore.

4940
02:12:31,241 --> 02:12:33,070
Now he's fallen into a rhythm.

4941
02:12:33,110 --> 02:12:33,943
So you like that.

4942
02:12:34,090 --> 02:12:34,610
Yeah.

4943
02:12:34,610 --> 02:12:34,810
So,

4944
02:12:34,810 --> 02:12:35,220
but see I,

4945
02:12:35,220 --> 02:12:35,981
he's throwing that kick,

4946
02:12:35,981 --> 02:12:36,470
like that's,

4947
02:12:36,470 --> 02:12:38,470
that's kicks landing and he's throwing it,

4948
02:12:38,620 --> 02:12:40,420
but he's not trying to
murder you at that kick,

4949
02:12:40,450 --> 02:12:41,190
you know?

4950
02:12:41,190 --> 02:12:42,023
Yeah.

4951
02:12:42,350 --> 02:12:43,180
Same with death punch.

4952
02:12:43,180 --> 02:12:43,811
It changes.

4953
02:12:43,811 --> 02:12:45,640
It all changes in that second round,

4954
02:12:46,450 --> 02:12:48,100
which is really interesting.

4955
02:12:48,790 --> 02:12:50,410
Hendrick's keeps coming in with that knee.

4956
02:12:50,980 --> 02:12:52,870
It's getting close to this dude.

4957
02:12:52,920 --> 02:12:56,050
Lombard is going back to his corner and
he looks very tired and Hendricks looks

4958
02:12:56,051 --> 02:12:56,884
pumped up.

4959
02:12:56,900 --> 02:12:57,733
Fascinating.

4960
02:12:58,090 --> 02:12:59,890
I had thought coming into this fight.

4961
02:12:59,970 --> 02:13:00,300
Yeah,

4962
02:13:00,300 --> 02:13:05,300
this would be a fight where
you know Johnny Hendricks
is in a a scary match with

4963
02:13:06,191 --> 02:13:10,330
one of the most fearsome
Kao Artists in the sport.

4964
02:13:10,630 --> 02:13:10,871
I mean,

4965
02:13:10,871 --> 02:13:11,231
you look at,

4966
02:13:11,231 --> 02:13:13,290
especially his Bella tour highlight reels,

4967
02:13:13,291 --> 02:13:13,911
so get that knee.

4968
02:13:13,911 --> 02:13:15,500
That was a beautiful knee by Hendrix.

4969
02:13:16,570 --> 02:13:19,450
You look at his Bella tour highlight
reel back when he was marking people over

4970
02:13:19,451 --> 02:13:19,990
there like,

4971
02:13:19,990 --> 02:13:21,160
oh my God,

4972
02:13:21,220 --> 02:13:22,090
everyone was afraid of him.

4973
02:13:22,120 --> 02:13:22,953
Oh my goodness.

4974
02:13:23,770 --> 02:13:24,603
He was huge.

4975
02:13:24,700 --> 02:13:25,533
He was huge.

4976
02:13:25,870 --> 02:13:26,890
And he came over here,

4977
02:13:26,920 --> 02:13:28,420
struggled a little bit at first.

4978
02:13:28,480 --> 02:13:29,890
Lost Tim Boetsch.

4979
02:13:30,850 --> 02:13:32,160
Remember that fight in a boring,

4980
02:13:32,160 --> 02:13:32,491
boring,

4981
02:13:32,491 --> 02:13:32,701
boring.

4982
02:13:32,701 --> 02:13:33,800
It wasn't a good fight for him.

4983
02:13:34,380 --> 02:13:35,370
Just didn't open up.

4984
02:13:38,250 --> 02:13:39,180
But the Henderson one,

4985
02:13:39,181 --> 02:13:44,181
the last one was the scariest lost cause
he got rocked by Henderson the first

4986
02:13:44,371 --> 02:13:45,540
and Henderson rocked him,

4987
02:13:45,810 --> 02:13:47,070
took him down and held him down,

4988
02:13:47,071 --> 02:13:50,760
was beaten them up on the ground and
then they had that crazy exchange or

4989
02:13:50,761 --> 02:13:54,270
Henderson caught him with an elbow to the
head and dropped him off a single aid.

4990
02:13:54,900 --> 02:13:55,340
Yeah,

4991
02:13:55,340 --> 02:13:55,591
Dude.

4992
02:13:55,591 --> 02:13:56,251
And you remember what he,

4993
02:13:56,251 --> 02:13:59,100
his Instagram post hit American
flag wrapped around him.

4994
02:13:59,101 --> 02:13:59,341
He said,

4995
02:13:59,341 --> 02:14:00,390
I smoked that Cuban.

4996
02:14:02,460 --> 02:14:03,570
That's so rude.

4997
02:14:05,520 --> 02:14:08,010
But it's acceptable because
it's Dan had Dan Henderson,

4998
02:14:08,011 --> 02:14:08,420
he can get away.

4999
02:14:08,420 --> 02:14:09,050
Oh.

5000
02:14:09,050 --> 02:14:09,750
Oh.

5001
02:14:09,750 --> 02:14:10,940
He clipped him with that
right over the hopper.

5002
02:14:10,960 --> 02:14:11,790
Look at this.

5003
02:14:11,790 --> 02:14:13,230
Hendrix takes it look.

5004
02:14:13,590 --> 02:14:14,423
Looks good.

5005
02:14:16,080 --> 02:14:17,100
Still light on his feet.

5006
02:14:17,190 --> 02:14:19,710
Still moving and not Lombard.

5007
02:14:19,711 --> 02:14:20,071
Lombard.

5008
02:14:20,071 --> 02:14:21,120
Totally flat footed.

5009
02:14:21,330 --> 02:14:25,080
And the more Hendricks does this to them
and feints him and gets him to react

5010
02:14:25,081 --> 02:14:25,860
and move,

5011
02:14:25,860 --> 02:14:28,020
the more it keeps Lombard from recovering.

5012
02:14:28,050 --> 02:14:29,040
So it's around a piece,

5013
02:14:29,041 --> 02:14:29,874
right?

5014
02:14:29,910 --> 02:14:30,180
Boy,

5015
02:14:30,180 --> 02:14:30,540
I dunno.

5016
02:14:30,540 --> 02:14:31,680
I'm not a good score.

5017
02:14:34,650 --> 02:14:35,281
Two rounds.

5018
02:14:35,281 --> 02:14:36,810
The first one I'd say around a piece.

5019
02:14:36,811 --> 02:14:37,440
Yeah.

5020
02:14:37,440 --> 02:14:40,920
Johnny Johnny's looking better
right now than he did last time.

5021
02:14:40,921 --> 02:14:42,540
Could you give the last round to Lombard?

5022
02:14:43,190 --> 02:14:45,810
Is it possible not that you were
given the last round of Hendrix?

5023
02:14:45,830 --> 02:14:46,620
No,

5024
02:14:46,620 --> 02:14:47,191
I'm asking.

5025
02:14:47,191 --> 02:14:48,024
Could you,

5026
02:14:48,570 --> 02:14:49,410
is it possible?

5027
02:14:49,470 --> 02:14:50,303
I don't think so.

5028
02:14:50,820 --> 02:14:51,660
So the last one,

5029
02:14:51,661 --> 02:14:53,160
you feel pretty clearly went to Hendricks?

5030
02:14:53,161 --> 02:14:53,670
Yeah.

5031
02:14:53,670 --> 02:14:55,110
The first round you said went to Lombard?

5032
02:14:55,520 --> 02:14:56,353
Yeah,

5033
02:14:58,020 --> 02:14:58,853
not by much.

5034
02:14:59,820 --> 02:15:01,200
I've been mostly talking shit.

5035
02:15:01,640 --> 02:15:02,473
Yeah.

5036
02:15:05,680 --> 02:15:06,513
Interesting.

5037
02:15:11,360 --> 02:15:14,570
Lombard throws what you would call
short kicks cause it's shortly.

5038
02:15:14,800 --> 02:15:15,410
Yeah.

5039
02:15:15,410 --> 02:15:18,290
But some guys that have
short legs can extend.

5040
02:15:18,620 --> 02:15:19,970
He throws the same way.

5041
02:15:19,971 --> 02:15:21,110
We were talking about how he,

5042
02:15:21,111 --> 02:15:22,670
like when he does his weightlifting,

5043
02:15:22,730 --> 02:15:25,100
he has like short extensions just like,

5044
02:15:25,101 --> 02:15:25,340
yeah.

5045
02:15:25,340 --> 02:15:26,091
Do you think he does that?

5046
02:15:26,091 --> 02:15:29,300
So we can be powerful and like
little short punches in short bursts.

5047
02:15:30,140 --> 02:15:31,010
I have no idea.

5048
02:15:31,400 --> 02:15:33,050
I wonder if there's like a theory to that,

5049
02:15:33,290 --> 02:15:33,570
you know,

5050
02:15:33,570 --> 02:15:34,430
the ultimate fighter,

5051
02:15:34,431 --> 02:15:35,750
how they have two rounds into the,

5052
02:15:35,800 --> 02:15:38,240
if it's too high.

5053
02:15:38,360 --> 02:15:38,680
Oh,

5054
02:15:38,680 --> 02:15:39,470
nice.

5055
02:15:39,470 --> 02:15:40,330
Lumbar Turret.

5056
02:15:41,040 --> 02:15:41,700
Yeah.

5057
02:15:41,700 --> 02:15:42,660
What do you guys feel about that?

5058
02:15:42,970 --> 02:15:43,803
Which one?

5059
02:15:44,190 --> 02:15:45,410
A tie after a third.

5060
02:15:45,740 --> 02:15:46,500
It's interesting.

5061
02:15:46,500 --> 02:15:47,630
Just like the ultimate fighter.

5062
02:15:47,870 --> 02:15:48,360
Yeah.

5063
02:15:48,360 --> 02:15:49,310
Saw bad idea.

5064
02:15:49,340 --> 02:15:50,690
Would it push the fighters more?

5065
02:15:51,260 --> 02:15:52,093
Uh,

5066
02:15:52,780 --> 02:15:53,270
um,

5067
02:15:53,270 --> 02:15:55,190
I would imagine that
it would a little bit.

5068
02:15:55,210 --> 02:15:55,270
Yeah,

5069
02:15:55,270 --> 02:15:55,821
for sure.

5070
02:15:55,821 --> 02:15:56,654
Right.

5071
02:15:57,520 --> 02:15:58,260
Give me more time.

5072
02:15:58,260 --> 02:16:03,260
And he would also like maybe reserve a
little in the tank and be Johnny keeps

5073
02:16:03,381 --> 02:16:04,700
hitting him with that left knee man.

5074
02:16:04,710 --> 02:16:05,000
Yeah,

5075
02:16:05,000 --> 02:16:06,440
he's hurting with that left knee.

5076
02:16:06,740 --> 02:16:08,720
He sees an opening every time lumbar,

5077
02:16:08,870 --> 02:16:09,201
lumbar,

5078
02:16:09,201 --> 02:16:12,260
it's closing in and now
Lombard is very flat footed.

5079
02:16:12,590 --> 02:16:15,050
You really need to win that first round,

5080
02:16:15,051 --> 02:16:15,680
you know?

5081
02:16:15,680 --> 02:16:16,513
Yeah.

5082
02:16:16,540 --> 02:16:18,500
At first round becomes very important.

5083
02:16:18,540 --> 02:16:19,373
Yeah.

5084
02:16:20,540 --> 02:16:20,781
Yeah.

5085
02:16:20,781 --> 02:16:21,980
When it's too round fight,

5086
02:16:23,480 --> 02:16:23,811
you know,

5087
02:16:23,811 --> 02:16:28,640
they always used to do that in k one
and in glory they do it to like in that

5088
02:16:28,641 --> 02:16:30,070
fucking crazy one

5089
02:16:30,070 --> 02:16:32,550
night we're Joe Schilling the same way.

5090
02:16:32,660 --> 02:16:33,493
That pattern,

5091
02:16:33,550 --> 02:16:37,360
how do I get one night Joe Schilling at
three fights in one night and glory last

5092
02:16:37,361 --> 02:16:38,170
man standing.

5093
02:16:38,170 --> 02:16:39,820
It was fucking crazy.

5094
02:16:40,210 --> 02:16:41,380
It was so much fun to watch.

5095
02:16:41,410 --> 02:16:44,180
It was so crazy in front row,

5096
02:16:44,181 --> 02:16:45,740
like Ah,

5097
02:16:46,150 --> 02:16:51,150
and he got dropped in like the first or
second round of his first fight and then

5098
02:16:51,311 --> 02:16:56,311
he comes back and knock Simon Marcus out
cold in the fourth after they had gone

5099
02:16:56,381 --> 02:16:58,870
to war for three rounds and
made them fight another round.

5100
02:16:58,871 --> 02:17:00,130
It was crazy.

5101
02:17:00,690 --> 02:17:01,420
I mean that was,

5102
02:17:01,420 --> 02:17:06,420
and then he fought again and then
he fought again on the same night.

5103
02:17:08,170 --> 02:17:10,780
I mean how the fuck is that legal

5104
02:17:12,570 --> 02:17:14,810
hell sanction that it was fucking,

5105
02:17:14,840 --> 02:17:15,160
cause he,

5106
02:17:15,160 --> 02:17:17,590
he had how many rounds of that and yeah,

5107
02:17:17,591 --> 02:17:17,981
like you said,

5108
02:17:17,981 --> 02:17:20,260
he got dropped in like the very
first round or something like that.

5109
02:17:20,261 --> 02:17:20,441
He was,

5110
02:17:20,441 --> 02:17:21,070
if he was in,

5111
02:17:21,070 --> 02:17:21,311
yeah,

5112
02:17:21,311 --> 02:17:22,720
I think he fought 10 rounds.

5113
02:17:23,110 --> 02:17:24,260
So you know,

5114
02:17:24,430 --> 02:17:25,670
he fought 10 rounds in a night.

5115
02:17:25,671 --> 02:17:26,980
Was kickboxing heavy,

5116
02:17:26,981 --> 02:17:27,880
heavy shit right there.

5117
02:17:28,240 --> 02:17:28,610
I mean he,

5118
02:17:28,610 --> 02:17:29,000
the,

5119
02:17:29,000 --> 02:17:30,310
they were all three round fights,

5120
02:17:30,311 --> 02:17:30,710
right?

5121
02:17:30,710 --> 02:17:31,480
Or anything.

5122
02:17:31,480 --> 02:17:33,310
Item 11 where they thrive.

5123
02:17:33,400 --> 02:17:34,630
They weren't too round pilots.

5124
02:17:34,650 --> 02:17:36,640
They didn't make them two
round fights in the semis.

5125
02:17:36,650 --> 02:17:37,150
They were three.

5126
02:17:37,150 --> 02:17:39,220
There were three rounds and he fought one,

5127
02:17:39,221 --> 02:17:39,790
four.

5128
02:17:39,790 --> 02:17:43,300
So one four because they
went three with Simon Marcus.

5129
02:17:44,290 --> 02:17:45,580
You had the final with Artem,

5130
02:17:45,730 --> 02:17:46,131
but then you,

5131
02:17:46,131 --> 02:17:46,631
he fought like,

5132
02:17:46,631 --> 02:17:47,830
who did you fight in between Gan,

5133
02:17:47,831 --> 02:17:49,750
that knee that Hendrix
caught him with that.

5134
02:17:50,140 --> 02:17:51,430
Look at that his head and let another one.

5135
02:17:51,460 --> 02:17:52,310
Oh,

5136
02:17:52,311 --> 02:17:53,230
he got tripped.

5137
02:17:53,770 --> 02:17:54,700
You got tripped.

5138
02:17:54,760 --> 02:17:55,960
Let's see how quick he can get up.

5139
02:17:56,080 --> 02:17:56,291
Oh,

5140
02:17:56,291 --> 02:17:57,124
he's just getting up.

5141
02:17:57,160 --> 02:17:58,870
He just got right the fuck up.

5142
02:17:59,080 --> 02:17:59,711
Wow.

5143
02:17:59,711 --> 02:18:00,700
He just got up.

5144
02:18:01,000 --> 02:18:02,170
He gave up his back.

5145
02:18:02,171 --> 02:18:03,340
Everything he knew.

5146
02:18:03,341 --> 02:18:04,260
Lombard was tired.

5147
02:18:04,261 --> 02:18:05,230
It slipped right off.

5148
02:18:05,231 --> 02:18:06,370
Slipped right off.

5149
02:18:07,710 --> 02:18:08,470
There's your argument,

5150
02:18:08,470 --> 02:18:09,510
Eddie right there.

5151
02:18:11,170 --> 02:18:12,190
It totally makes sense.

5152
02:18:14,140 --> 02:18:15,940
You want to promote offense on the ground?

5153
02:18:15,941 --> 02:18:16,774
In my opinion.

5154
02:18:16,780 --> 02:18:17,530
That's a cheap,

5155
02:18:17,530 --> 02:18:19,180
that would be the smart business.

5156
02:18:19,181 --> 02:18:22,300
Move Lombard's till closing in.

5157
02:18:26,290 --> 02:18:27,123
Okay.

5158
02:18:27,270 --> 02:18:28,320
Johnny's finally tired.

5159
02:18:30,320 --> 02:18:30,441
Oh,

5160
02:18:30,441 --> 02:18:31,730
they're both tired right now,

5161
02:18:31,731 --> 02:18:32,201
but lumbar,

5162
02:18:32,201 --> 02:18:33,440
it seems like he's a little fresher.

5163
02:18:33,441 --> 02:18:34,250
All of a sudden.

5164
02:18:34,250 --> 02:18:35,210
I think he smells blood.

5165
02:18:35,240 --> 02:18:35,391
Ooh.

5166
02:18:35,391 --> 02:18:37,130
That front kick to the body and again.

5167
02:18:38,020 --> 02:18:38,853
Oh,

5168
02:18:40,450 --> 02:18:41,140
Ooh.

5169
02:18:41,140 --> 02:18:42,220
That kick to the body.

5170
02:18:42,670 --> 02:18:43,450
Interesting.

5171
02:18:43,450 --> 02:18:45,370
Lombard looks much better now.

5172
02:18:46,320 --> 02:18:46,810
Ooh.

5173
02:18:46,810 --> 02:18:47,201
Oh,

5174
02:18:47,201 --> 02:18:48,460
nice leg kick by Johnny.

5175
02:18:49,990 --> 02:18:50,760
Yeah.

5176
02:18:50,760 --> 02:18:51,593
10 seconds.

5177
02:18:51,600 --> 02:18:52,411
10 seconds.

5178
02:18:52,411 --> 02:18:53,400
What happens now?

5179
02:18:56,130 --> 02:18:57,550
Oh yeah.

5180
02:18:57,600 --> 02:18:58,433
He hurt his hand.

5181
02:19:03,020 --> 02:19:03,291
Wow.

5182
02:19:03,291 --> 02:19:04,130
He broke his hand.

5183
02:19:04,190 --> 02:19:07,730
He might've broke his hand with that
one punchy through or just sprained his

5184
02:19:07,731 --> 02:19:08,564
wrist.

5185
02:19:10,610 --> 02:19:11,550
He's had carpal tunnel.

5186
02:19:11,730 --> 02:19:12,563
You ever done?

5187
02:19:14,450 --> 02:19:15,480
It is possible.

5188
02:19:15,930 --> 02:19:16,763
Good point.

5189
02:19:17,420 --> 02:19:18,253
Yeah.

5190
02:19:18,840 --> 02:19:20,820
That's going to sway the judges decision.

5191
02:19:21,150 --> 02:19:21,780
I don't know.

5192
02:19:21,780 --> 02:19:22,080
You know?

5193
02:19:22,080 --> 02:19:24,030
I mean what did he really do mean?

5194
02:19:24,031 --> 02:19:25,950
He hit him with a couple
of good body kicks,

5195
02:19:27,080 --> 02:19:27,950
but then the hand,

5196
02:19:27,980 --> 02:19:29,480
I'm talking about the hand getting broken.

5197
02:19:29,690 --> 02:19:30,291
Who knows?

5198
02:19:30,291 --> 02:19:31,760
I mean there's nothing
you can do about that.

5199
02:19:31,850 --> 02:19:31,971
No,

5200
02:19:31,971 --> 02:19:32,271
I know,

5201
02:19:32,271 --> 02:19:35,930
but still like in around he has,

5202
02:19:36,140 --> 02:19:37,520
he broke his rest.

5203
02:19:38,240 --> 02:19:39,740
He got hurt at the end.

5204
02:19:40,130 --> 02:19:40,963
I don't know.

5205
02:19:41,600 --> 02:19:42,680
He's kind of like,

5206
02:19:42,890 --> 02:19:43,161
no,

5207
02:19:43,161 --> 02:19:44,250
I don't think that would mess with you.

5208
02:19:44,470 --> 02:19:44,870
No,

5209
02:19:44,870 --> 02:19:45,170
no.

5210
02:19:45,170 --> 02:19:47,480
It's not going to have anything to do
with the judging the end of that fight the

5211
02:19:47,481 --> 02:19:48,070
way it looks.

5212
02:19:48,070 --> 02:19:48,340
No.

5213
02:19:48,340 --> 02:19:48,770
Okay.

5214
02:19:48,770 --> 02:19:50,630
I think if we were
really going to judge it,

5215
02:19:50,780 --> 02:19:53,660
oh you mean him running
around at the very end?

5216
02:19:53,810 --> 02:19:55,040
We would have to push it,

5217
02:19:55,110 --> 02:19:55,480
push it,

5218
02:19:55,480 --> 02:19:56,780
push it one way or the other.

5219
02:19:57,320 --> 02:20:00,050
You know that ending
ending with the wrist.

5220
02:20:00,550 --> 02:20:01,101
What do you do?

5221
02:20:01,101 --> 02:20:02,570
You really remember the first round,

5222
02:20:02,571 --> 02:20:03,404
clearly.

5223
02:20:03,590 --> 02:20:05,360
I remember moments in a second.

5224
02:20:05,361 --> 02:20:08,420
I think you're taking down
once that method that you,

5225
02:20:08,421 --> 02:20:12,110
you were doing when you were doing it
for the UFC where you were the unofficial

5226
02:20:12,260 --> 02:20:13,760
Harold Letterman for the UFC.

5227
02:20:14,030 --> 02:20:14,863
That was great.

5228
02:20:15,020 --> 02:20:15,853
That was fun.

5229
02:20:16,130 --> 02:20:18,070
And you had a really
good point to it and you,

5230
02:20:18,071 --> 02:20:20,900
it helped me because you
would like quantify it.

5231
02:20:20,901 --> 02:20:21,261
I'd be like,

5232
02:20:21,261 --> 02:20:22,400
why did you give it to that guy?

5233
02:20:22,640 --> 02:20:23,031
And you're like,

5234
02:20:23,031 --> 02:20:26,630
well he got the two takedowns but he
hurt him with the leg kicks and hit him

5235
02:20:26,631 --> 02:20:27,021
with a punch.

5236
02:20:27,021 --> 02:20:27,380
And I was like,

5237
02:20:27,380 --> 02:20:27,561
oh,

5238
02:20:27,561 --> 02:20:27,801
okay.

5239
02:20:27,801 --> 02:20:28,440
I see.

5240
02:20:28,440 --> 02:20:30,280
Like I just felt like that matter more.

5241
02:20:30,290 --> 02:20:31,280
Got to take notes.

5242
02:20:31,310 --> 02:20:32,180
You've got a whole system.

5243
02:20:32,280 --> 02:20:34,690
If you're going on air to give your

5244
02:20:37,940 --> 02:20:38,990
analysis of the fight,

5245
02:20:38,991 --> 02:20:39,860
you gotta know your Shit.

5246
02:20:39,861 --> 02:20:40,700
So it was really good.

5247
02:20:41,030 --> 02:20:42,110
You should do that again man.

5248
02:20:42,260 --> 02:20:42,891
If they had like,

5249
02:20:42,891 --> 02:20:44,630
you know when the HBO boxing going to be,

5250
02:20:44,660 --> 02:20:45,290
Oh,

5251
02:20:45,290 --> 02:20:48,380
you know Eddie Bravo is breakdown and
blah blah blah and have all your little

5252
02:20:48,400 --> 02:20:49,310
number at,

5253
02:20:49,430 --> 02:20:50,570
you'll have a fucking little chart,

5254
02:20:50,600 --> 02:20:51,890
but the way you wrote it down,

5255
02:20:51,891 --> 02:20:53,720
was he the way he did it was really good.

5256
02:20:53,800 --> 02:20:54,400
The hologram,

5257
02:20:54,400 --> 02:20:55,490
a good system.

5258
02:20:56,060 --> 02:20:59,140
I feel like Johnny Hendricks might
have this barely paid attention.

5259
02:20:59,150 --> 02:20:59,983
That's fine.

5260
02:21:01,340 --> 02:21:02,173
I'm just over here.

5261
02:21:03,080 --> 02:21:08,080
My unofficial take on the official
take big rig I where I see,

5262
02:21:08,931 --> 02:21:09,351
I told you,

5263
02:21:09,351 --> 02:21:11,240
I know motherfuckers doubt me.

5264
02:21:13,010 --> 02:21:14,390
I have no idea how it's going.

5265
02:21:15,590 --> 02:21:17,000
I don't have any idea,

5266
02:21:17,001 --> 02:21:19,190
but I felt like Hendrix
look better in this fight.

5267
02:21:19,550 --> 02:21:22,970
Then he has an a long time and even
really know after the fight he looks way

5268
02:21:22,971 --> 02:21:23,804
fresher.

5269
02:21:24,020 --> 02:21:25,460
Fuck weight cutting man.

5270
02:21:26,330 --> 02:21:28,900
Is One 35 a possibility for you if,

5271
02:21:28,970 --> 02:21:32,000
fuck yeah dude.

5272
02:21:32,030 --> 02:21:32,631
I mean for real,

5273
02:21:32,631 --> 02:21:36,560
maybe that's the solution because you
imagine someone's going to Photoshop your

5274
02:21:36,561 --> 02:21:37,580
face on a guy like

5275
02:21:39,080 --> 02:21:40,160
hurting from weight,

5276
02:21:40,161 --> 02:21:41,650
cutting the fuck wait,

5277
02:21:41,651 --> 02:21:42,770
cutting Photoshop,

5278
02:21:42,771 --> 02:21:43,101
Steve,

5279
02:21:43,101 --> 02:21:43,490
get on it.

5280
02:21:43,490 --> 02:21:44,031
That's the thing.

5281
02:21:44,031 --> 02:21:46,490
It's not hard for me to make one 25 right.

5282
02:21:46,520 --> 02:21:47,960
But I know he shuts down.

5283
02:21:48,860 --> 02:21:49,850
You can actually do it,

5284
02:21:49,851 --> 02:21:53,690
but it's obviously vastly
healthier to not do it.

5285
02:21:53,750 --> 02:21:54,200
Yes.

5286
02:21:54,200 --> 02:21:55,130
Because when you don't do it,

5287
02:21:55,131 --> 02:21:56,000
you don't have these issues.

5288
02:21:56,001 --> 02:21:56,660
Right.

5289
02:21:56,660 --> 02:22:00,110
You don't ever get like up to a point
where you can't swallow food or any of

5290
02:22:00,111 --> 02:22:00,231
that.

5291
02:22:00,231 --> 02:22:01,220
This is all I used to.

5292
02:22:01,670 --> 02:22:03,740
But then after I got sick in Ireland,

5293
02:22:03,741 --> 02:22:04,574
that went away.

5294
02:22:05,120 --> 02:22:06,910
But I still gotta I gotta
get that in a minute.

5295
02:22:07,340 --> 02:22:09,260
Getting sick in Ireland cured it.

5296
02:22:09,620 --> 02:22:10,360
No,

5297
02:22:10,360 --> 02:22:10,621
I don't know.

5298
02:22:10,621 --> 02:22:11,390
He went away.

5299
02:22:11,390 --> 02:22:12,021
It just stopped.

5300
02:22:12,021 --> 02:22:13,010
It just stopped happening.

5301
02:22:13,011 --> 02:22:13,840
As bad as it was,

5302
02:22:13,840 --> 02:22:18,840
because for whatever reason I'd have
that seizing up my esophagus and I would

5303
02:22:19,220 --> 02:22:23,030
either pass out and throw up or I would
just feel like I'm going to pass out and

5304
02:22:23,031 --> 02:22:26,100
then my throwing up would
last like an hour to

5305
02:22:26,160 --> 02:22:26,880
a couple of days.

5306
02:22:26,880 --> 02:22:27,601
Oh God.

5307
02:22:27,601 --> 02:22:27,931
Damn,

5308
02:22:27,931 --> 02:22:28,171
dude,

5309
02:22:28,171 --> 02:22:28,741
that's horrible.

5310
02:22:28,741 --> 02:22:29,700
They had no idea.

5311
02:22:29,701 --> 02:22:29,911
So we,

5312
02:22:29,911 --> 02:22:30,091
oh,

5313
02:22:30,091 --> 02:22:30,391
whatever.

5314
02:22:30,391 --> 02:22:31,440
I'm fucking under the good shape.

5315
02:22:31,441 --> 02:22:31,951
I need to fight,

5316
02:22:31,951 --> 02:22:32,970
so let's do it.

5317
02:22:33,690 --> 02:22:34,520
So I don't know.

5318
02:22:34,520 --> 02:22:36,360
I bet she's fucking a long time.

5319
02:22:36,390 --> 02:22:37,223
It's just,

5320
02:22:37,680 --> 02:22:38,400
you know,

5321
02:22:38,400 --> 02:22:42,030
I need to just feel better eventually
cause this isn't working out.

5322
02:22:42,560 --> 02:22:43,470
It's fucking killing me.

5323
02:22:44,040 --> 02:22:45,870
How many times have you
competed at band point?

5324
02:22:46,530 --> 02:22:47,030
Oh,

5325
02:22:47,030 --> 02:22:47,640
a bunch.

5326
02:22:47,640 --> 02:22:48,330
A bunch.

5327
02:22:48,330 --> 02:22:49,020
What do you,

5328
02:22:49,020 --> 02:22:51,250
how do you feel different
in flyweight bantamweight?

5329
02:22:51,650 --> 02:22:52,250
Um,

5330
02:22:52,250 --> 02:22:53,160
no means are just bigger than me.

5331
02:22:53,161 --> 02:22:54,450
I don't have the big of a frame,

5332
02:22:54,790 --> 02:22:55,890
but whatever.

5333
02:22:56,630 --> 02:22:57,463
I just want to fight.

5334
02:22:57,540 --> 02:23:00,330
But how did you feel like
physically while you're competing?

5335
02:23:00,780 --> 02:23:00,981
Oh,

5336
02:23:00,981 --> 02:23:01,960
did you feel different?

5337
02:23:02,220 --> 02:23:02,371
No,

5338
02:23:02,371 --> 02:23:02,850
I felt fine.

5339
02:23:02,850 --> 02:23:04,860
So at one 25 you were
feeling fine as well,

5340
02:23:04,980 --> 02:23:07,590
like when you've made weight and
been able to find them been healthy?

5341
02:23:07,620 --> 02:23:08,190
Yeah.

5342
02:23:08,190 --> 02:23:11,280
Do you think it's potentially that as you
get older you've just done it too many

5343
02:23:11,281 --> 02:23:11,820
times?

5344
02:23:11,820 --> 02:23:13,290
Just cut way too many times.

5345
02:23:13,291 --> 02:23:14,340
You're body's starting to reject it.

5346
02:23:14,370 --> 02:23:15,330
That could be it too.

5347
02:23:15,450 --> 02:23:15,670
Yeah.

5348
02:23:15,670 --> 02:23:17,310
I've been doing this
my fucking whole life.

5349
02:23:18,800 --> 02:23:19,633
Yeah.

5350
02:23:19,820 --> 02:23:20,061
You know,

5351
02:23:20,061 --> 02:23:20,400
and I've,

5352
02:23:20,400 --> 02:23:22,200
I've finally got it figured
out where it's easy,

5353
02:23:22,860 --> 02:23:25,920
where I spent the last half of my
life doing it in a really negative,

5354
02:23:26,130 --> 02:23:27,150
harmful way to my body.

5355
02:23:27,151 --> 02:23:27,511
And you know what,

5356
02:23:27,511 --> 02:23:28,650
I think it also is to,

5357
02:23:28,651 --> 02:23:31,530
I think you're probably
tougher and you get,

5358
02:23:31,800 --> 02:23:35,850
as you get older and you get
like more accepting of pain,

5359
02:23:36,300 --> 02:23:36,481
you know,

5360
02:23:36,481 --> 02:23:37,500
you find that a lot.

5361
02:23:37,501 --> 02:23:39,510
And like older fighters in particular,

5362
02:23:39,511 --> 02:23:40,800
there are a lot of them are like,

5363
02:23:40,801 --> 02:23:42,930
like Randy coture like late in his age,

5364
02:23:43,320 --> 02:23:47,550
he was just so tough because
he had experienced so much
shit had been through so

5365
02:23:47,551 --> 02:23:50,730
much shit he had been through and
his mind was so fucking strong.

5366
02:23:51,240 --> 02:23:51,491
You know,

5367
02:23:51,491 --> 02:23:53,250
like Randy coture dude,

5368
02:23:53,251 --> 02:23:56,430
I remember when he beat Tim Silvia
and nobody gave him a God damn chance.

5369
02:23:56,431 --> 02:23:57,510
Nobody gave him a chance.

5370
02:23:57,511 --> 02:23:59,730
He was fighting the heavyweight
champ who was a giant.

5371
02:24:00,180 --> 02:24:00,361
I mean,

5372
02:24:00,361 --> 02:24:03,950
Tim Sylvia is a huge man
and Randy [inaudible] seven,

5373
02:24:03,960 --> 02:24:04,201
six,

5374
02:24:04,201 --> 02:24:04,680
eight,

5375
02:24:04,680 --> 02:24:05,251
some shit like that.

5376
02:24:05,251 --> 02:24:05,680
And he's,

5377
02:24:05,680 --> 02:24:06,513
he's almost,

5378
02:24:06,690 --> 02:24:06,991
yeah,

5379
02:24:06,991 --> 02:24:08,310
he's gotta be in that range.

5380
02:24:08,340 --> 02:24:09,061
I said giant.

5381
02:24:09,061 --> 02:24:09,900
Tim was huge.

5382
02:24:10,410 --> 02:24:15,410
And Randy hops in with an inside leg
kick fake to an overhand bomb and just

5383
02:24:16,891 --> 02:24:19,410
drops the hammer on Tim
Silvia knocks them down.

5384
02:24:19,440 --> 02:24:20,040
Remember that?

5385
02:24:20,040 --> 02:24:20,580
Oh yeah.

5386
02:24:20,580 --> 02:24:21,180
Which Eddie,

5387
02:24:21,180 --> 02:24:25,440
I was talking about older fighters
that are just tough guys like hen,

5388
02:24:25,500 --> 02:24:30,500
like Dan Henderson is some older dudes
that are just so fucking tough that I'm

5389
02:24:31,771 --> 02:24:33,210
wondering if like,

5390
02:24:33,240 --> 02:24:37,350
maybe your weight cut is easier just
because your mind is different now.

5391
02:24:37,770 --> 02:24:38,551
You know that you're just,

5392
02:24:38,551 --> 02:24:42,090
you're just more accustomed to all the
pain from the surgeries and all the

5393
02:24:42,091 --> 02:24:45,510
different things you've gone through
that you just can eat it better.

5394
02:24:46,980 --> 02:24:47,820
There's Woodley again,

5395
02:24:47,850 --> 02:24:48,690
Jesus Christ,

5396
02:24:48,760 --> 02:24:49,030
that,

5397
02:24:49,030 --> 02:24:51,000
that could be a definite thing.

5398
02:24:51,120 --> 02:24:52,860
I've been through a lot of painful things.

5399
02:24:52,861 --> 02:24:53,311
That's my cup.

5400
02:24:53,311 --> 02:24:54,144
My old coach said,

5401
02:24:54,710 --> 02:24:55,543
Collin Oyama,

5402
02:24:56,390 --> 02:24:56,550
uh,

5403
02:24:56,550 --> 02:24:56,790
he,

5404
02:24:56,790 --> 02:24:57,421
he was just like,

5405
02:24:57,421 --> 02:24:58,770
you just have a different threshold.

5406
02:24:58,880 --> 02:24:59,221
And he's like,

5407
02:24:59,221 --> 02:25:00,030
you've died,

5408
02:25:00,030 --> 02:25:00,900
Moan about other guys.

5409
02:25:00,901 --> 02:25:01,621
My have other teammates.

5410
02:25:01,621 --> 02:25:03,720
He got shot like five times and he's like,

5411
02:25:03,721 --> 02:25:06,000
you should guys have just different
pressure on both of you guys have died

5412
02:25:06,001 --> 02:25:06,460
before.

5413
02:25:06,460 --> 02:25:07,290
Cause he gets just,

5414
02:25:07,290 --> 02:25:07,831
I don't know what it's,

5415
02:25:07,831 --> 02:25:08,700
what it is.

5416
02:25:08,701 --> 02:25:09,710
They come across to lever,

5417
02:25:09,780 --> 02:25:11,640
you've got some super spiritual power sun.

5418
02:25:11,760 --> 02:25:12,250
And I was like,

5419
02:25:12,250 --> 02:25:12,660
Oh,

5420
02:25:12,660 --> 02:25:14,430
you know what else has that shit a court?

5421
02:25:14,431 --> 02:25:16,140
Mcgowan says that Shit,

5422
02:25:16,170 --> 02:25:17,010
Matt Brown,

5423
02:25:17,190 --> 02:25:18,030
[inaudible] Court,

5424
02:25:18,031 --> 02:25:19,760
Mcgee rather court Mckinnon's a comic.

5425
02:25:20,040 --> 02:25:20,910
He doesn't have that at all.

5426
02:25:21,180 --> 02:25:21,800
He's a nice guy.

5427
02:25:21,800 --> 02:25:22,021
I just,

5428
02:25:22,021 --> 02:25:22,910
Shane Miguel a senior.

5429
02:25:23,080 --> 02:25:23,280
No,

5430
02:25:23,280 --> 02:25:23,920
it was a good guy.

5431
02:25:23,920 --> 02:25:24,000
I

5432
02:25:24,000 --> 02:25:25,300
can't even imagine him being in a fight,

5433
02:25:25,720 --> 02:25:28,750
but court McGee has got
that unbreakable spirit.

5434
02:25:28,810 --> 02:25:29,200
I mean,

5435
02:25:29,200 --> 02:25:33,100
for whatever is his body holds up
as much as his body's can hold up.

5436
02:25:33,220 --> 02:25:35,110
His mind's gonna just push
his body to its limits.

5437
02:25:35,111 --> 02:25:35,530
Yeah.

5438
02:25:35,530 --> 02:25:37,330
Like when you seeing him in fights,

5439
02:25:37,350 --> 02:25:38,950
like a lot of his fights,

5440
02:25:39,310 --> 02:25:41,740
particularly our earlier in his career,

5441
02:25:41,800 --> 02:25:43,150
he's had some tough fights lately,

5442
02:25:43,570 --> 02:25:44,403
but he's,

5443
02:25:44,680 --> 02:25:48,130
he overwhelms guys with
cardio and would drive.

5444
02:25:48,460 --> 02:25:51,970
He runs with weight vests
on in the altitude and Utah,

5445
02:25:52,030 --> 02:25:54,360
you know he's at a pit elevated.

5446
02:25:54,361 --> 02:25:54,950
Yeah.

5447
02:25:54,950 --> 02:25:55,670
That's where I knew him from,

5448
02:25:55,670 --> 02:25:56,410
from the pit,

5449
02:25:56,410 --> 02:25:57,430
but he's one of those guys,

5450
02:25:57,431 --> 02:25:58,121
he'd same thing,

5451
02:25:58,121 --> 02:25:59,260
had a drug overdose,

5452
02:25:59,410 --> 02:26:00,243
died.

5453
02:26:00,310 --> 02:26:01,240
They brought him back.

5454
02:26:01,840 --> 02:26:03,670
Those guys that have
been to the other side,

5455
02:26:04,330 --> 02:26:05,200
they're just more,

5456
02:26:05,260 --> 02:26:06,010
they're just,

5457
02:26:06,010 --> 02:26:06,281
I don't know.

5458
02:26:06,281 --> 02:26:07,570
There's something scary about them.

5459
02:26:07,930 --> 02:26:09,100
It doesn't mean you can't beat him.

5460
02:26:09,310 --> 02:26:09,800
Right?

5461
02:26:09,800 --> 02:26:10,060
Yeah.

5462
02:26:10,060 --> 02:26:10,241
I mean,

5463
02:26:10,241 --> 02:26:10,421
every,

5464
02:26:10,421 --> 02:26:11,770
every one of those guys has lost.

5465
02:26:13,240 --> 02:26:14,140
But I mean,

5466
02:26:14,200 --> 02:26:16,300
Matt Brown at his best,

5467
02:26:16,330 --> 02:26:17,320
marching towards you,

5468
02:26:17,321 --> 02:26:19,390
trying to kill you is one of
the scariest human beings.

5469
02:26:19,480 --> 02:26:20,860
Really frightened it's ever,

5470
02:26:20,980 --> 02:26:21,940
ever lived.

5471
02:26:22,160 --> 02:26:22,520
I mean,

5472
02:26:22,520 --> 02:26:23,710
until you take him out,

5473
02:26:23,980 --> 02:26:24,491
you're in,

5474
02:26:24,491 --> 02:26:27,130
you're in a hellacious
battle with a demon.

5475
02:26:27,400 --> 02:26:27,840
You know,

5476
02:26:27,840 --> 02:26:30,010
Matt Brown is just coming at you elbows,

5477
02:26:30,011 --> 02:26:30,461
knees,

5478
02:26:30,461 --> 02:26:30,851
kicks,

5479
02:26:30,851 --> 02:26:31,660
punches.

5480
02:26:31,660 --> 02:26:32,860
He smells any blood.

5481
02:26:32,861 --> 02:26:35,350
He's moving in on face angry

5482
02:26:35,660 --> 02:26:36,110
Matt,

5483
02:26:36,110 --> 02:26:38,900
which acts like he's died a couple times.

5484
02:26:41,750 --> 02:26:42,980
He probably has.

5485
02:26:42,981 --> 02:26:43,311
I mean,

5486
02:26:43,311 --> 02:26:46,160
there's nobody on the
planet like Mad Horowich.

5487
02:26:46,190 --> 02:26:46,401
Yeah,

5488
02:26:46,401 --> 02:26:48,110
he's gonna let you guys super,

5489
02:26:48,230 --> 02:26:49,490
super interesting guy.

5490
02:26:52,870 --> 02:26:53,030
Yeah,

5491
02:26:53,030 --> 02:26:53,863
there's a lot of wild.

5492
02:26:53,890 --> 02:26:54,723
Uh,

5493
02:26:55,280 --> 02:26:57,590
you'd think maybe it's time to

5494
02:26:59,090 --> 02:27:00,560
not fight anymore.

5495
02:27:00,740 --> 02:27:02,480
Is that a weird thing to say?

5496
02:27:03,680 --> 02:27:03,891
Well,

5497
02:27:03,891 --> 02:27:04,160
yeah,

5498
02:27:04,160 --> 02:27:05,360
and you can't even make a fist.

5499
02:27:05,361 --> 02:27:05,781
I think.

5500
02:27:05,781 --> 02:27:06,614
Uh,

5501
02:27:06,710 --> 02:27:07,670
what else am I going to do?

5502
02:27:07,700 --> 02:27:08,570
My brain still works.

5503
02:27:10,090 --> 02:27:10,923
Um,

5504
02:27:11,440 --> 02:27:12,350
fuck it while I let me.

5505
02:27:12,380 --> 02:27:13,580
I should save it while it works.

5506
02:27:13,640 --> 02:27:14,473
Um,

5507
02:27:14,480 --> 02:27:15,200
how old are you?

5508
02:27:15,200 --> 02:27:16,033
32.

5509
02:27:16,490 --> 02:27:17,270
Okay.

5510
02:27:17,270 --> 02:27:17,811
So it's,

5511
02:27:17,811 --> 02:27:18,080
it's,

5512
02:27:18,080 --> 02:27:19,250
I'm not looking to fight for much longer.

5513
02:27:20,060 --> 02:27:20,350
Okay.

5514
02:27:20,350 --> 02:27:24,200
Know I made all that other stuff though,

5515
02:27:24,320 --> 02:27:29,090
that esophagus one day and
then gallbladder the next day.

5516
02:27:29,810 --> 02:27:30,231
Yeah,

5517
02:27:30,231 --> 02:27:30,561
we don't,

5518
02:27:30,561 --> 02:27:32,570
we don't know what it maybe,

5519
02:27:33,200 --> 02:27:34,033
maybe,

5520
02:27:34,070 --> 02:27:36,620
maybe it's better to be broken alive.

5521
02:27:37,100 --> 02:27:37,933
You know what I mean?

5522
02:27:38,570 --> 02:27:39,403
I don't even know.

5523
02:27:40,250 --> 02:27:41,000
Right.

5524
02:27:41,000 --> 02:27:42,800
It's done through close your fist dude.

5525
02:27:43,550 --> 02:27:44,383
You know what I mean?

5526
02:27:44,420 --> 02:27:45,253
Yeah.

5527
02:27:45,560 --> 02:27:46,191
You have a gym,

5528
02:27:46,191 --> 02:27:46,640
right?

5529
02:27:46,640 --> 02:27:47,240
No,

5530
02:27:47,240 --> 02:27:49,100
you don't need to get a goddamn jam.

5531
02:27:50,420 --> 02:27:50,901
Everybody.

5532
02:27:50,901 --> 02:27:52,880
Anybody in the fight game,

5533
02:27:54,020 --> 02:27:56,590
unless you have some kind of job that,

5534
02:27:56,591 --> 02:27:57,380
uh,

5535
02:27:57,380 --> 02:27:59,690
is a secure and there's,

5536
02:28:01,100 --> 02:28:01,880
I mean,

5537
02:28:01,880 --> 02:28:02,713
shit,

5538
02:28:02,810 --> 02:28:03,830
why not open a gym?

5539
02:28:03,990 --> 02:28:04,940
I teach me about a fight.

5540
02:28:04,941 --> 02:28:05,481
That's what you do.

5541
02:28:05,481 --> 02:28:09,530
You're a professional fighter and make
people want to learn how to find teaching

5542
02:28:09,531 --> 02:28:10,364
people much.

5543
02:28:10,760 --> 02:28:10,950
Well,

5544
02:28:10,950 --> 02:28:11,360
I think,

5545
02:28:11,360 --> 02:28:11,601
well,

5546
02:28:11,601 --> 02:28:14,480
it's better than fighting when
you have esophagus problems.

5547
02:28:15,230 --> 02:28:16,063
You know what I mean?

5548
02:28:16,190 --> 02:28:16,910
Yeah.

5549
02:28:16,910 --> 02:28:17,900
But what do you do?

5550
02:28:18,000 --> 02:28:18,930
Talking logic over there?

5551
02:28:20,360 --> 02:28:20,520
I mean,

5552
02:28:20,520 --> 02:28:22,070
you got to one fight.

5553
02:28:22,070 --> 02:28:23,060
It's Esophagus.

5554
02:28:23,720 --> 02:28:25,130
The next fights gallbladder.

5555
02:28:25,150 --> 02:28:26,390
It can't even make a fist.

5556
02:28:26,720 --> 02:28:27,860
You should open up a gym,

5557
02:28:27,861 --> 02:28:28,390
man.

5558
02:28:28,390 --> 02:28:29,390
Do you got to do it eventually?

5559
02:28:29,391 --> 02:28:30,710
I can still beat motherfuckers up.

5560
02:28:30,860 --> 02:28:32,420
But do you want to open up a gym?

5561
02:28:32,421 --> 02:28:32,750
No.

5562
02:28:32,750 --> 02:28:33,291
Then you should know,

5563
02:28:33,291 --> 02:28:35,000
but it was not talking
about staying alive.

5564
02:28:35,180 --> 02:28:36,620
I'm talking about staying alive though.

5565
02:28:37,010 --> 02:28:38,000
He's trying to talk me into things.

5566
02:28:38,001 --> 02:28:38,510
I don't want to do that.

5567
02:28:38,510 --> 02:28:40,060
I'm talking about staying alive,

5568
02:28:40,070 --> 02:28:40,903
man.

5569
02:28:41,240 --> 02:28:42,170
Don't do a gym.

5570
02:28:42,171 --> 02:28:43,420
Then I start to,

5571
02:28:43,620 --> 02:28:47,760
I have a rash guard and I've got the
podcasts and stuff and we're going to up

5572
02:28:47,761 --> 02:28:48,594
much and other stuff.

5573
02:28:48,950 --> 02:28:49,340
Okay.

5574
02:28:49,340 --> 02:28:49,671
I've got,

5575
02:28:49,671 --> 02:28:51,040
I've got many irons,

5576
02:28:51,090 --> 02:28:53,480
a million different ways to
make a living in this world.

5577
02:28:53,900 --> 02:28:57,310
I think the most important
thing for everyone is to try it.

5578
02:28:57,311 --> 02:29:00,590
At least tried to make a live and doing
that thing that you really enjoyed

5579
02:29:00,591 --> 02:29:00,890
doing.

5580
02:29:00,890 --> 02:29:02,480
You love teaching Jujitsu.

5581
02:29:02,510 --> 02:29:04,670
You've always loved
teaching Jiu Jitsu for you.

5582
02:29:05,240 --> 02:29:07,070
It's a totally natural thing,

5583
02:29:07,520 --> 02:29:09,950
but there are some people that just
don't like training other people,

5584
02:29:09,951 --> 02:29:10,550
man.

5585
02:29:10,550 --> 02:29:11,690
They just don't enjoy it.

5586
02:29:11,900 --> 02:29:12,650
I don't,

5587
02:29:12,650 --> 02:29:13,100
you know,

5588
02:29:13,100 --> 02:29:13,933
I guess it's,

5589
02:29:14,090 --> 02:29:15,920
it takes every kind of people you know,

5590
02:29:17,480 --> 02:29:20,450
but it's okay if you really want to
make it as a podcast or you could do it.

5591
02:29:20,960 --> 02:29:21,681
You could do that too.

5592
02:29:21,681 --> 02:29:22,280
Man.

5593
02:29:22,280 --> 02:29:23,113
You're funny.

5594
02:29:23,300 --> 02:29:24,020
Eric's funny.

5595
02:29:24,020 --> 02:29:25,120
You guys are interesting together.

5596
02:29:26,090 --> 02:29:26,923
It's a good idea.

5597
02:29:27,050 --> 02:29:27,471
I've got two,

5598
02:29:27,471 --> 02:29:28,141
I've got two shows,

5599
02:29:28,141 --> 02:29:30,020
so hopefully they'll work out
what I'm going to work out.

5600
02:29:30,021 --> 02:29:30,350
At least.

5601
02:29:30,350 --> 02:29:33,290
I feel like the thing with those things
is just trying your best and being

5602
02:29:33,291 --> 02:29:36,680
consistent and trying to
improve and you're going to
have stumbles and you'll be

5603
02:29:36,681 --> 02:29:37,670
better in other shows.

5604
02:29:37,671 --> 02:29:38,960
Then you were in certain shows,

5605
02:29:39,470 --> 02:29:41,360
but just keep doing it and you,

5606
02:29:41,570 --> 02:29:43,910
you know a fuck load about fighting dude,

5607
02:29:44,150 --> 02:29:48,410
and I feel like the big brown breakdown
that [inaudible] does is one of his most

5608
02:29:48,411 --> 02:29:51,410
important podcast and he's getting
millions of downloads now for that.

5609
02:29:51,690 --> 02:29:54,830
It's big cab because he's
inexperienced former UFC fighters.

5610
02:29:54,831 --> 02:29:55,670
A smart dude,

5611
02:29:55,940 --> 02:29:56,990
he understands fighting.

5612
02:29:56,991 --> 02:29:57,231
He's,

5613
02:29:57,231 --> 02:29:58,320
he's controversial,

5614
02:29:58,330 --> 02:30:00,800
is not afraid to call
things like he sees them.

5615
02:30:00,801 --> 02:30:02,180
He's not attached to anybody.

5616
02:30:02,181 --> 02:30:03,770
No one could tell him
what the fuck to say.

5617
02:30:04,070 --> 02:30:05,150
And because of that,

5618
02:30:05,151 --> 02:30:07,640
his podcast is getting
millions of downloads,

5619
02:30:09,290 --> 02:30:09,800
you know?

5620
02:30:09,800 --> 02:30:12,800
Also another option is if
you don't like teaching,

5621
02:30:13,100 --> 02:30:14,300
you could be the owner.

5622
02:30:14,301 --> 02:30:15,380
You don't have to do any of the teeth.

5623
02:30:15,710 --> 02:30:16,880
Don't listen to this dude.

5624
02:30:17,040 --> 02:30:18,770
It's the same thing with the MMA business.

5625
02:30:18,771 --> 02:30:21,140
He's trying to draw us all in
together for some pyramid scheme.

5626
02:30:21,700 --> 02:30:21,970
Say,

5627
02:30:21,970 --> 02:30:22,870
Hey ted,

5628
02:30:22,940 --> 02:30:24,410
planet 10 played in San Clemente,

5629
02:30:24,411 --> 02:30:26,180
Joe Rogan fighting championships.

5630
02:30:28,480 --> 02:30:28,700
Yeah,

5631
02:30:28,700 --> 02:30:29,830
just send me a black dog to run.

5632
02:30:29,850 --> 02:30:30,430
Call it,

5633
02:30:30,430 --> 02:30:31,370
call it out on the beach.

5634
02:30:31,400 --> 02:30:32,300
Uncle creepy.

5635
02:30:32,301 --> 02:30:33,950
Emma May have a big kid's program.

5636
02:30:34,160 --> 02:30:34,993
Yeah,

5637
02:30:35,770 --> 02:30:36,603
there we go.

5638
02:30:36,980 --> 02:30:37,880
Exactly.

5639
02:30:38,560 --> 02:30:40,190
He's with Ray Sefo here.

5640
02:30:40,191 --> 02:30:41,024
Interesting.

5641
02:30:41,090 --> 02:30:43,820
Travis Browne walking into
the cage with Ray Sefo,

5642
02:30:43,850 --> 02:30:45,080
the legendary fuck.

5643
02:30:45,081 --> 02:30:45,914
Yeah,

5644
02:30:45,950 --> 02:30:46,330
that's right.

5645
02:30:46,330 --> 02:30:47,190
And um,

5646
02:30:47,420 --> 02:30:50,410
so that they're not in
Vegas and brick you on Dell.

5647
02:30:50,720 --> 02:30:51,740
Who's awesome.

5648
02:30:51,780 --> 02:30:51,980
Yeah,

5649
02:30:51,980 --> 02:30:53,870
I love that it was there
a nicer guy on the planet?

5650
02:30:54,950 --> 02:30:55,371
Honestly,

5651
02:30:55,371 --> 02:30:55,581
I don't,

5652
02:30:55,581 --> 02:30:56,030
I don't know.

5653
02:30:56,030 --> 02:30:56,760
I mean it might be,

5654
02:30:56,760 --> 02:31:00,200
it might be the nicest guys
ever lived the old line down,

5655
02:31:00,201 --> 02:31:01,280
the interactions I had with him,

5656
02:31:02,320 --> 02:31:03,510
he's the nicest phonies and

5657
02:31:05,450 --> 02:31:07,790
right up there they could be roommates,

5658
02:31:08,170 --> 02:31:08,451
you know,

5659
02:31:08,451 --> 02:31:10,130
like what are these guys
smoking best friends,

5660
02:31:10,131 --> 02:31:10,430
man.

5661
02:31:10,430 --> 02:31:10,850
Yeah.

5662
02:31:10,850 --> 02:31:11,870
He's a super nice guy,

5663
02:31:11,871 --> 02:31:12,230
man.

5664
02:31:12,230 --> 02:31:12,400
No,

5665
02:31:12,400 --> 02:31:17,400
Marcel is one of the Nice Skype they
would live to between Marcello and Kelvin

5666
02:31:17,420 --> 02:31:17,600
Gastelum.

5667
02:31:17,600 --> 02:31:18,530
He's a nice guy too.

5668
02:31:18,620 --> 02:31:19,453
Oh,

5669
02:31:19,890 --> 02:31:20,070
there's

5670
02:31:20,070 --> 02:31:21,690
a lot of Nice guys like a teddy bear.

5671
02:31:23,400 --> 02:31:25,290
I still believe in Travis Brown,

5672
02:31:25,291 --> 02:31:25,501
man.

5673
02:31:25,501 --> 02:31:26,071
I really do.

5674
02:31:26,071 --> 02:31:29,730
If Travis Brown could get back to that
footwork and movement that he had with

5675
02:31:29,731 --> 02:31:30,171
Stephan's.

5676
02:31:30,171 --> 02:31:30,510
True.

5677
02:31:30,510 --> 02:31:31,343
Yes.

5678
02:31:31,350 --> 02:31:32,183
You know the,

5679
02:31:32,210 --> 02:31:32,541
the,

5680
02:31:32,541 --> 02:31:32,781
the,

5681
02:31:32,781 --> 02:31:35,100
the will to come back
that he had with Alster.

5682
02:31:35,910 --> 02:31:40,140
I still think that Travis
Browne physically looked
at tools that he possesses.

5683
02:31:40,141 --> 02:31:43,800
If he could put it all together and be
like super motivated and then have his

5684
02:31:43,801 --> 02:31:46,050
mind strong and just believe in himself.

5685
02:31:46,470 --> 02:31:51,470
He still got some of the best school best
tools in the heavyweight division now

5686
02:31:52,171 --> 02:31:52,960
as his athleticism,

5687
02:31:52,960 --> 02:31:55,710
his song so long in his movement.

5688
02:31:55,830 --> 02:31:58,290
Remember when he used to move
almost like a giant Dominick Cruz,

5689
02:31:58,860 --> 02:32:01,560
he would see him popping around
and move and as a big heavyweight,

5690
02:32:01,561 --> 02:32:03,360
like this is a super unusual,

5691
02:32:03,720 --> 02:32:06,060
I see a guy that big
that can move that well,

5692
02:32:07,100 --> 02:32:07,441
but I mean,

5693
02:32:07,441 --> 02:32:07,891
who knows?

5694
02:32:07,891 --> 02:32:10,050
Maybe he's had some knee
knee issues or something.

5695
02:32:10,080 --> 02:32:10,913
You know,

5696
02:32:13,850 --> 02:32:14,611
you really don't know.

5697
02:32:14,611 --> 02:32:14,791
I mean,

5698
02:32:14,791 --> 02:32:16,510
he did have that hamstring blowout.

5699
02:32:16,540 --> 02:32:19,980
Remember when he fought big
foot on his legs just gave out,

5700
02:32:19,981 --> 02:32:20,061
right?

5701
02:32:20,061 --> 02:32:20,460
Yeah.

5702
02:32:20,460 --> 02:32:25,460
His hamstring just blew out in the
middle of the round and he went down.

5703
02:32:25,471 --> 02:32:26,140
I don't remember what it,

5704
02:32:26,140 --> 02:32:27,190
what it was that he tore.

5705
02:32:27,600 --> 02:32:28,920
So leave it was a hamstring.

5706
02:32:29,250 --> 02:32:33,030
And I wonder if his leg got
fucked up in that going.

5707
02:32:33,070 --> 02:32:34,290
Is this a conspiracy theory?

5708
02:32:34,291 --> 02:32:39,210
Eti my making it more conspiracy theory
about Travis Browne's lack of movement.

5709
02:32:39,630 --> 02:32:40,560
Did his leg explode?

5710
02:32:40,620 --> 02:32:41,580
That's fake news.

5711
02:32:43,470 --> 02:32:45,990
I know it definitely gave out
on him and the big foot fight,

5712
02:32:45,991 --> 02:32:47,180
but I wonder if that was a,

5713
02:32:47,181 --> 02:32:49,470
an injury that continue to be significant.

5714
02:32:49,620 --> 02:32:52,410
Did someone put a banana
peel or was it a rollerskate?

5715
02:32:53,310 --> 02:32:56,240
How many times have you
been injured and look,

5716
02:32:56,250 --> 02:32:57,001
whatever the injury is,

5717
02:32:57,001 --> 02:32:58,800
you came back to the point
where you could fight again.

5718
02:32:58,800 --> 02:33:00,600
But that feeling was always there.

5719
02:33:00,630 --> 02:33:02,160
Like it's always been compromised.

5720
02:33:02,260 --> 02:33:03,300
How many times that happened to you?

5721
02:33:03,630 --> 02:33:03,890
Uh,

5722
02:33:03,890 --> 02:33:06,540
once this whole thing,

5723
02:33:07,200 --> 02:33:08,280
the whole arm thing.

5724
02:33:08,580 --> 02:33:13,580
Both parts of your arm is this Brown said
it might have been the very first kick

5725
02:33:14,041 --> 02:33:15,840
he through his left hamstring pop.

5726
02:33:15,841 --> 02:33:17,490
The extent of the injury isn't known.

5727
02:33:18,340 --> 02:33:19,230
It soon became clear.

5728
02:33:19,231 --> 02:33:21,210
It wasn't working with
a stable foundation.

5729
02:33:21,270 --> 02:33:21,511
Yeah.

5730
02:33:21,511 --> 02:33:22,344
So his,

5731
02:33:23,140 --> 02:33:23,811
see when,

5732
02:33:23,811 --> 02:33:26,070
when you're in your
hamstring pops like that.

5733
02:33:26,100 --> 02:33:31,100
The thing that I would think another
issue cross would be the knee because of

5734
02:33:31,231 --> 02:33:33,000
your hamstring is not connected anymore.

5735
02:33:33,001 --> 02:33:36,390
Your knee is going to be all mushy and
shit and you're probably not going to

5736
02:33:36,391 --> 02:33:39,150
have the ability to keep
yourself from a twisting it.

5737
02:33:40,200 --> 02:33:41,490
You can wind up fucking your knee up.

5738
02:33:41,491 --> 02:33:43,810
It's at least it's possible that
you could wind up fucking up.

5739
02:33:47,980 --> 02:33:49,840
I just think that like
when he was younger,

5740
02:33:49,841 --> 02:33:50,051
man,

5741
02:33:50,051 --> 02:33:51,310
he was so mobile.

5742
02:33:52,710 --> 02:33:54,190
Now that's when he was
training down in San Diego.

5743
02:33:54,340 --> 02:33:55,173
Yeah,

5744
02:33:55,270 --> 02:33:56,170
that's true too.

5745
02:33:56,171 --> 02:33:56,531
Right?

5746
02:33:56,531 --> 02:33:58,330
He was training with Dominick Cruz.

5747
02:33:59,100 --> 02:34:03,330
I wonder if maybe they decide after a
while that that takes too much energy for

5748
02:34:03,360 --> 02:34:04,193
heavyweight.

5749
02:34:04,450 --> 02:34:05,430
Is that possible?

5750
02:34:05,450 --> 02:34:06,410
We'll put that there.

5751
02:34:06,420 --> 02:34:09,400
Maybe he chose to change it that way,

5752
02:34:10,460 --> 02:34:11,530
that when you went to Tain,

5753
02:34:11,531 --> 02:34:11,890
right?

5754
02:34:11,890 --> 02:34:12,723
Yeah.

5755
02:34:14,390 --> 02:34:14,481
Yeah.

5756
02:34:14,481 --> 02:34:14,681
The,

5757
02:34:14,681 --> 02:34:14,841
the,

5758
02:34:14,841 --> 02:34:16,100
the human body can only take so much,

5759
02:34:16,101 --> 02:34:16,640
I guess.

5760
02:34:16,640 --> 02:34:19,090
So don't know how much I'm
supposed to talk about this,

5761
02:34:19,540 --> 02:34:21,130
so I probably shouldn't
talk about it too much.

5762
02:34:21,131 --> 02:34:23,950
But I was talking to DC about cane,

5763
02:34:24,370 --> 02:34:24,611
you know,

5764
02:34:24,611 --> 02:34:24,970
about,

5765
02:34:24,970 --> 02:34:25,803
uh,

5766
02:34:25,840 --> 02:34:26,221
him,

5767
02:34:26,221 --> 02:34:26,470
uh,

5768
02:34:26,470 --> 02:34:27,460
him coming back,

5769
02:34:28,090 --> 02:34:28,421
you know,

5770
02:34:28,421 --> 02:34:31,090
and apparently he's back
to a training again.

5771
02:34:31,091 --> 02:34:32,110
He had back surgery.

5772
02:34:32,200 --> 02:34:32,590
Yeah.

5773
02:34:32,590 --> 02:34:33,200
And I,

5774
02:34:33,200 --> 02:34:33,401
you know,

5775
02:34:33,401 --> 02:34:34,000
like some,

5776
02:34:34,000 --> 02:34:34,780
some things,

5777
02:34:34,780 --> 02:34:36,070
but when you start,

5778
02:34:36,100 --> 02:34:36,460
I mean,

5779
02:34:36,460 --> 02:34:38,890
apparently the doctor
said he's good to go.

5780
02:34:39,010 --> 02:34:39,331
He's,

5781
02:34:39,331 --> 02:34:43,210
he's ready to fight again and
he's trained in light and getting,

5782
02:34:43,211 --> 02:34:44,170
getting back to the group.

5783
02:34:44,171 --> 02:34:49,171
But when you see a guy like that that
has that kind of crazy indomitable will,

5784
02:34:49,750 --> 02:34:51,400
and then his body just starts to break it.

5785
02:34:52,430 --> 02:34:54,810
It's like just red line and everything.

5786
02:34:54,811 --> 02:34:55,000
Yeah.

5787
02:34:55,000 --> 02:34:56,630
Eh,

5788
02:34:56,750 --> 02:34:57,250
Bang.

5789
02:34:57,250 --> 02:34:57,730
Yeah.

5790
02:34:57,730 --> 02:34:59,350
Now when one of those things happens,

5791
02:34:59,650 --> 02:35:01,630
how often are you ever 100% again.

5792
02:35:03,160 --> 02:35:03,501
Oh,

5793
02:35:03,501 --> 02:35:04,334
man,

5794
02:35:04,780 --> 02:35:06,250
100% was a long time ago.

5795
02:35:06,910 --> 02:35:07,743
Right.

5796
02:35:07,920 --> 02:35:09,310
How do you think that's the same thing?

5797
02:35:09,430 --> 02:35:10,540
Just as off the record,

5798
02:35:10,541 --> 02:35:11,710
but for a guy like Cain,

5799
02:35:12,100 --> 02:35:12,851
it's not off the record.

5800
02:35:12,851 --> 02:35:13,684
People are listening,

5801
02:35:13,930 --> 02:35:14,760
what's the word?

5802
02:35:14,760 --> 02:35:15,593
Um,

5803
02:35:15,810 --> 02:35:16,643
unofficially.

5804
02:35:16,660 --> 02:35:16,930
Yeah,

5805
02:35:16,930 --> 02:35:17,150
yeah,

5806
02:35:17,150 --> 02:35:17,501
of course.

5807
02:35:17,501 --> 02:35:17,731
You,

5808
02:35:17,731 --> 02:35:17,911
you,

5809
02:35:17,911 --> 02:35:19,840
you never get back to 100% but you,

5810
02:35:19,841 --> 02:35:21,910
you know that's just right.

5811
02:35:22,030 --> 02:35:22,863
That's life.

5812
02:35:23,380 --> 02:35:25,000
Like significant injuries,

5813
02:35:25,750 --> 02:35:26,583
very diff.

5814
02:35:26,680 --> 02:35:27,401
Tito Ortiz,

5815
02:35:27,401 --> 02:35:28,390
pre and post,

5816
02:35:28,540 --> 02:35:30,070
all those spinal surgeries.

5817
02:35:30,100 --> 02:35:31,050
Totally different cider.

5818
02:35:31,140 --> 02:35:31,990
That's crazy.

5819
02:35:32,050 --> 02:35:33,370
Totally is having frontline worked on.

5820
02:35:33,371 --> 02:35:33,730
Yeah,

5821
02:35:33,730 --> 02:35:34,300
I dude,

5822
02:35:34,300 --> 02:35:36,730
several times he's got fused disks.

5823
02:35:36,731 --> 02:35:38,410
He's got fake discs.

5824
02:35:38,860 --> 02:35:40,060
He's got his neck fused.

5825
02:35:40,061 --> 02:35:41,260
You ever see them working on his neck?

5826
02:35:41,740 --> 02:35:42,573
Yo,

5827
02:35:42,710 --> 02:35:43,150
bad.

5828
02:35:43,150 --> 02:35:46,270
How about that video when they're
hammering into his neck with a fucking

5829
02:35:46,271 --> 02:35:48,040
screwdriver or whatever
the hell they're doing.

5830
02:35:48,610 --> 02:35:49,630
That's horrific.

5831
02:35:50,920 --> 02:35:51,870
And that guy went back.

5832
02:35:52,360 --> 02:35:53,193
Yeah,

5833
02:35:53,200 --> 02:35:56,110
that guy went out and fought
and got guillotined after that,

5834
02:35:56,770 --> 02:35:57,200
you know,

5835
02:35:57,200 --> 02:35:59,080
I mean Chels son and almost getting them.

5836
02:35:59,650 --> 02:36:00,011
That's all.

5837
02:36:00,011 --> 02:36:00,611
After that,

5838
02:36:00,611 --> 02:36:01,320
his neck,

5839
02:36:01,320 --> 02:36:03,640
his neck is screwed together.

5840
02:36:06,340 --> 02:36:06,491
Yeah.

5841
02:36:06,491 --> 02:36:07,324
That's to suck.

5842
02:36:08,410 --> 02:36:09,970
It's the nuttiest sport man.

5843
02:36:10,030 --> 02:36:10,870
There it is right there.

5844
02:36:11,170 --> 02:36:13,330
That's the video of them
working on Tito's neck.

5845
02:36:14,320 --> 02:36:15,071
He put it online.

5846
02:36:15,071 --> 02:36:15,904
The sick bastard.

5847
02:36:16,130 --> 02:36:16,541
Look at that.

5848
02:36:16,541 --> 02:36:17,730
They've got his neck open.

5849
02:36:18,540 --> 02:36:19,373
Yup.

5850
02:36:19,530 --> 02:36:20,490
Look at that shit,

5851
02:36:20,491 --> 02:36:21,324
dude.

5852
02:36:21,480 --> 02:36:23,220
They're just sucking things out of there.

5853
02:36:23,370 --> 02:36:24,360
Taking in there.

5854
02:36:24,970 --> 02:36:26,010
Oh fuck,

5855
02:36:26,790 --> 02:36:27,480
fuck,

5856
02:36:27,480 --> 02:36:27,901
fuck.

5857
02:36:27,901 --> 02:36:28,261
And look,

5858
02:36:28,261 --> 02:36:29,670
they have to hammer it in place.

5859
02:36:29,880 --> 02:36:31,050
It's so hard to watch,

5860
02:36:31,051 --> 02:36:31,380
Dude.

5861
02:36:31,380 --> 02:36:33,150
It is so fucking hard to watch.

5862
02:36:33,151 --> 02:36:33,984
I'm squirming.

5863
02:36:34,430 --> 02:36:34,530
Well,

5864
02:36:34,530 --> 02:36:37,360
there's no way they could have put mine
on video because they went through the

5865
02:36:37,361 --> 02:36:37,780
front.

5866
02:36:37,780 --> 02:36:40,330
They had to pull out my or
pull my organs to the side.

5867
02:36:40,360 --> 02:36:41,230
Oh Dude.

5868
02:36:41,290 --> 02:36:41,431
Yeah.

5869
02:36:41,431 --> 02:36:41,640
There,

5870
02:36:41,640 --> 02:36:43,810
there's a special doctor I guess.

5871
02:36:43,840 --> 02:36:45,320
I guess a cardiologist.

5872
02:36:45,321 --> 02:36:45,870
They,

5873
02:36:45,870 --> 02:36:50,870
that splits all the Oregons and opens
everything up so the doctor can go in

5874
02:36:52,451 --> 02:36:53,710
there and do some screw.

5875
02:36:53,711 --> 02:36:57,670
And did they did the main and then
look as it takes my butthole pucker up.

5876
02:36:57,790 --> 02:37:00,310
I don't know how many hours I forget,

5877
02:37:00,460 --> 02:37:04,960
but they put me out and I woke up and I
was laying there and this guy's just a

5878
02:37:04,961 --> 02:37:05,794
wizard at it.

5879
02:37:06,280 --> 02:37:08,140
Apparently I got a really good doctor.

5880
02:37:08,380 --> 02:37:08,920
I was,

5881
02:37:08,920 --> 02:37:10,900
and they put a fake disc in there.

5882
02:37:10,930 --> 02:37:12,820
And how long has the fake disc good for?

5883
02:37:13,390 --> 02:37:14,223
50 years.

5884
02:37:14,230 --> 02:37:15,620
50 something like that.

5885
02:37:16,290 --> 02:37:17,050
I don't know.

5886
02:37:17,050 --> 02:37:17,491
What do you do?

5887
02:37:17,491 --> 02:37:19,130
What if you're still alive?

5888
02:37:19,870 --> 02:37:20,703
Um,

5889
02:37:22,740 --> 02:37:23,573
get your,

5890
02:37:24,180 --> 02:37:25,440
get your shit fixed again.

5891
02:37:26,250 --> 02:37:29,160
You only get a engineer 95 I
don't know what I'm going to do,

5892
02:37:29,161 --> 02:37:29,390
man.

5893
02:37:29,390 --> 02:37:32,040
Disc operation at 95 might
just jump off a building.

5894
02:37:32,100 --> 02:37:32,933
I don't know

5895
02:37:35,040 --> 02:37:36,210
how to fly shit.

5896
02:37:36,740 --> 02:37:37,573
Huh?

5897
02:37:37,620 --> 02:37:41,640
Sometimes I think what if one of
the screws gets loose or something?

5898
02:37:41,990 --> 02:37:42,780
Ooh.

5899
02:37:42,780 --> 02:37:43,301
How about this?

5900
02:37:43,301 --> 02:37:44,940
By however they did it,

5901
02:37:44,941 --> 02:37:45,810
I'm not sure how they did it.

5902
02:37:46,350 --> 02:37:48,240
I'm sure there was some
kind of screwing involved.

5903
02:37:48,300 --> 02:37:48,780
Oh yeah.

5904
02:37:48,780 --> 02:37:49,140
Right.

5905
02:37:49,140 --> 02:37:49,973
They didn't use glue.

5906
02:37:50,130 --> 02:37:51,960
Some kind of jailing.

5907
02:37:52,020 --> 02:37:52,561
Yes.

5908
02:37:52,561 --> 02:37:52,830
Yeah.

5909
02:37:52,830 --> 02:37:54,690
I've got screws in both my knees and uh,

5910
02:37:55,380 --> 02:37:56,610
sometimes I think about that.

5911
02:37:56,790 --> 02:37:57,750
They stay in you.

5912
02:37:58,650 --> 02:38:00,420
Your body absorbs some of them.

5913
02:38:00,421 --> 02:38:01,680
Like on one knee,

5914
02:38:01,710 --> 02:38:04,040
you can't even tell like the screw marked,

5915
02:38:04,060 --> 02:38:09,060
like the body absorbs whatever the screws
made out of Ou Derrick Lewis coming

5916
02:38:09,451 --> 02:38:10,260
out swinging.

5917
02:38:10,260 --> 02:38:10,951
But on my other one,

5918
02:38:10,951 --> 02:38:11,521
it's still in there.

5919
02:38:11,521 --> 02:38:12,354
There's still metal.

5920
02:38:13,960 --> 02:38:15,390
The two big boys.

5921
02:38:15,840 --> 02:38:16,673
Yeah.

5922
02:38:16,770 --> 02:38:18,000
This is dangerous fight.

5923
02:38:18,180 --> 02:38:20,100
Very dangerous fight for both guys.

5924
02:38:20,370 --> 02:38:21,690
Anything can happen in this fight.

5925
02:38:23,760 --> 02:38:24,151
Ooh,

5926
02:38:24,151 --> 02:38:25,140
nice leg kick.

5927
02:38:26,370 --> 02:38:29,310
Travis Brown light on
his feet on the outside.

5928
02:38:30,450 --> 02:38:35,450
I just still think this dude has some
extreme physical gifts and his ex in,

5929
02:38:36,720 --> 02:38:37,553
in moments,

5930
02:38:37,650 --> 02:38:38,850
he's been extraordinary.

5931
02:38:39,390 --> 02:38:39,781
You know,

5932
02:38:39,781 --> 02:38:42,810
if you looked at like that
superman punch to Stephan Struve,

5933
02:38:42,930 --> 02:38:44,570
you looked at when he
knocked out Allister,

5934
02:38:44,610 --> 02:38:47,790
you're looking at when he knocked out
Schaub he's had moments where he's

5935
02:38:47,791 --> 02:38:48,511
extraordinary.

5936
02:38:48,511 --> 02:38:49,050
Yes.

5937
02:38:49,050 --> 02:38:50,190
And he's not done.

5938
02:38:50,820 --> 02:38:53,250
Look a look at his frame of how long
has it laser and he's a heavyweight.

5939
02:38:53,340 --> 02:38:54,173
He's not done.

5940
02:38:54,710 --> 02:38:55,060
He's,

5941
02:38:55,060 --> 02:38:55,620
he's uh,

5942
02:38:55,620 --> 02:38:56,453
I mean easy.

5943
02:38:56,650 --> 02:38:57,510
It's just gifted.

5944
02:38:57,511 --> 02:38:58,500
Did that frame yeah.

5945
02:38:58,650 --> 02:38:59,850
He's also a savage.

5946
02:38:59,880 --> 02:39:00,390
Yes.

5947
02:39:00,390 --> 02:39:01,500
It's like I just,

5948
02:39:01,680 --> 02:39:02,251
I just,

5949
02:39:02,251 --> 02:39:03,840
I still believe in Travis Brown.

5950
02:39:03,841 --> 02:39:07,470
I think Travis Brown
just made some changes,

5951
02:39:07,500 --> 02:39:07,740
you know.

5952
02:39:07,740 --> 02:39:10,560
I know he's done a lot of training at
black house for this fight and that could

5953
02:39:10,561 --> 02:39:11,730
be real beneficial for them.

5954
02:39:12,390 --> 02:39:14,610
Probably needs more big guys to work with.

5955
02:39:15,060 --> 02:39:16,290
But he looks good here man.

5956
02:39:16,360 --> 02:39:16,581
Woo.

5957
02:39:16,581 --> 02:39:18,630
Nice leg kick by Louis.

5958
02:39:22,010 --> 02:39:23,390
See Louis in my opinion,

5959
02:39:23,420 --> 02:39:25,160
like he improved his cardio.

5960
02:39:25,520 --> 02:39:25,830
Ue,

5961
02:39:25,830 --> 02:39:26,301
you heard him,

5962
02:39:26,301 --> 02:39:27,134
you heard him with that,

5963
02:39:27,380 --> 02:39:28,250
that kick to the body.

5964
02:39:28,251 --> 02:39:29,150
He's an he's hurt.

5965
02:39:30,290 --> 02:39:31,280
Wow.

5966
02:39:31,281 --> 02:39:31,821
He heard,

5967
02:39:31,821 --> 02:39:32,654
um,

5968
02:39:33,030 --> 02:39:34,010
the good at surviving.

5969
02:39:34,310 --> 02:39:34,790
Wow.

5970
02:39:34,790 --> 02:39:39,440
Very interesting boy Travis get
in there and Niamh to the body.

5971
02:39:41,210 --> 02:39:41,601
Wow,

5972
02:39:41,601 --> 02:39:42,620
this is interesting.

5973
02:39:42,950 --> 02:39:43,850
He's going to feel terrible.

5974
02:39:43,851 --> 02:39:46,480
If you let them survive was any time.

5975
02:39:46,520 --> 02:39:46,820
Yup.

5976
02:39:46,820 --> 02:39:47,240
Yup.

5977
02:39:47,240 --> 02:39:49,040
Front kick to the body and again,

5978
02:39:49,041 --> 02:39:50,960
he's kicking you from so far out.

5979
02:39:51,320 --> 02:39:53,210
He throws a good round
kick to the body too.

5980
02:39:54,920 --> 02:39:55,880
Very interesting.

5981
02:39:55,910 --> 02:39:56,451
Oh,

5982
02:39:56,451 --> 02:39:57,530
inside leg kick.

5983
02:39:57,950 --> 02:39:59,180
Look how far he is.

5984
02:39:59,210 --> 02:39:59,871
Oh,

5985
02:39:59,871 --> 02:40:00,231
you heard him?

5986
02:40:00,231 --> 02:40:01,370
I can't hear you again.

5987
02:40:01,371 --> 02:40:02,570
The front kick to the body.

5988
02:40:03,170 --> 02:40:04,003
He heard him.

5989
02:40:04,070 --> 02:40:04,700
You heard them.

5990
02:40:04,700 --> 02:40:04,851
Oh,

5991
02:40:04,851 --> 02:40:06,080
Derek is firing back.

5992
02:40:06,560 --> 02:40:07,490
This is interesting,

5993
02:40:07,491 --> 02:40:08,324
man.

5994
02:40:09,110 --> 02:40:09,411
See,

5995
02:40:09,411 --> 02:40:12,980
this is way more kicks than we've
seen of him in recent fights.

5996
02:40:13,410 --> 02:40:14,370
Look at that beautiful

5997
02:40:14,370 --> 02:40:16,670
leg kick slides away from any pause.

5998
02:40:16,690 --> 02:40:17,700
Possible counters.

5999
02:40:18,180 --> 02:40:20,310
He looks fucking great
and I sit of that left,

6000
02:40:20,340 --> 02:40:22,590
left body kick or the right body kick.

6001
02:40:22,591 --> 02:40:23,910
He's been doing it with the right leg.

6002
02:40:24,540 --> 02:40:25,373
There you go.

6003
02:40:26,550 --> 02:40:26,851
Oh,

6004
02:40:26,851 --> 02:40:27,684
both

6005
02:40:30,240 --> 02:40:31,150
those are his babies,

6006
02:40:31,210 --> 02:40:32,043
but

6007
02:40:35,580 --> 02:40:36,413
I liked him.

6008
02:40:36,840 --> 02:40:39,990
That we'll kick has gotten more
people in more fucking trouble.

6009
02:40:40,140 --> 02:40:41,400
The Chris Weidman wheel kit,

6010
02:40:41,580 --> 02:40:43,470
that is the wheel kick
heard round the world.

6011
02:40:44,880 --> 02:40:45,141
Oh,

6012
02:40:45,141 --> 02:40:45,974
he heard them again.

6013
02:40:46,290 --> 02:40:49,170
He says slapping him with his toes
a little bit and it's hurting him.

6014
02:40:49,650 --> 02:40:49,951
Oh,

6015
02:40:49,951 --> 02:40:51,000
beautiful leg kick.

6016
02:40:51,180 --> 02:40:51,481
Oh Buddy.

6017
02:40:51,481 --> 02:40:52,314
Went down.

6018
02:40:52,410 --> 02:40:53,243
Oh Shit.

6019
02:40:54,380 --> 02:40:55,380
Back up to his feet.

6020
02:40:55,650 --> 02:40:56,371
Very nice.

6021
02:40:56,371 --> 02:40:56,631
It's fine.

6022
02:40:56,631 --> 02:40:57,240
It's fun.

6023
02:40:57,240 --> 02:40:57,511
I guess.

6024
02:40:57,511 --> 02:40:58,690
That's exactly what he was hoping.

6025
02:40:58,691 --> 02:40:59,524
It wasn't going to.

6026
02:40:59,850 --> 02:41:00,480
Holy Shit.

6027
02:41:00,480 --> 02:41:00,651
Oh,

6028
02:41:00,651 --> 02:41:01,860
he threw the front kick again.

6029
02:41:01,890 --> 02:41:03,120
Derek Lewis with bombs.

6030
02:41:04,530 --> 02:41:05,700
Derrick Lewis improved his.

6031
02:41:05,740 --> 02:41:06,573
Oh,

6032
02:41:07,290 --> 02:41:08,123
beautiful.

6033
02:41:08,340 --> 02:41:09,173
Beautiful.

6034
02:41:09,240 --> 02:41:10,073
Wow.

6035
02:41:10,320 --> 02:41:10,801
Finish him.

6036
02:41:10,801 --> 02:41:11,101
Come on.

6037
02:41:11,101 --> 02:41:11,934
Let's go.

6038
02:41:12,320 --> 02:41:13,021
God Damn,

6039
02:41:13,021 --> 02:41:13,560
he's Tad.

6040
02:41:13,560 --> 02:41:15,120
Damn Derrick Lewis can take it.

6041
02:41:15,390 --> 02:41:16,710
Holy Shit.

6042
02:41:16,890 --> 02:41:17,581
Whoa.

6043
02:41:17,581 --> 02:41:18,414
He's tough.

6044
02:41:19,560 --> 02:41:21,960
That will lie time minute 40 minute,

6045
02:41:21,961 --> 02:41:22,794
40.

6046
02:41:23,220 --> 02:41:23,700
Wow.

6047
02:41:23,700 --> 02:41:26,400
Can you recover from
those during the fight?

6048
02:41:26,401 --> 02:41:26,551
Yeah,

6049
02:41:26,551 --> 02:41:27,301
you can recover,

6050
02:41:27,301 --> 02:41:28,860
but it might not totally recover.

6051
02:41:28,861 --> 02:41:29,694
You still hurt.

6052
02:41:30,110 --> 02:41:30,640
You know,

6053
02:41:30,640 --> 02:41:31,000
and you're,

6054
02:41:31,000 --> 02:41:35,310
you're definitely more susceptible
to body shots so bad too.

6055
02:41:35,620 --> 02:41:35,941
So she,

6056
02:41:35,941 --> 02:41:37,050
that sternum shot there?

6057
02:41:37,500 --> 02:41:37,831
Yeah,

6058
02:41:37,831 --> 02:41:38,610
man.

6059
02:41:38,610 --> 02:41:39,270
That uh,

6060
02:41:39,270 --> 02:41:41,910
solar plexus shot the way
he just landed that knee.

6061
02:41:42,000 --> 02:41:42,833
Oof.

6062
02:41:44,000 --> 02:41:44,460
Oh,

6063
02:41:44,460 --> 02:41:45,780
and if you've ever been liver hint,

6064
02:41:45,870 --> 02:41:47,220
as anybody ever hit you in the liver,

6065
02:41:47,580 --> 02:41:50,160
in the stomach where you lose your breath,

6066
02:41:50,280 --> 02:41:51,360
you know when you can't breathe.

6067
02:41:51,420 --> 02:41:52,260
Is that the liver?

6068
02:41:52,290 --> 02:41:53,700
Now liver is weird dude,

6069
02:41:53,870 --> 02:41:57,780
because sometimes people can hit you
in the same spot and nothing happens.

6070
02:41:58,530 --> 02:41:58,921
They get hit.

6071
02:41:58,921 --> 02:41:59,730
You right there,

6072
02:41:59,730 --> 02:42:00,210
Pam.

6073
02:42:00,210 --> 02:42:01,050
Nothing happens.

6074
02:42:01,170 --> 02:42:02,190
But other times,

6075
02:42:02,700 --> 02:42:04,530
just for whatever reason,

6076
02:42:04,531 --> 02:42:06,240
and it doesn't have to be
the biggest shot either,

6077
02:42:06,241 --> 02:42:10,530
it's just a perfectly placed shot to
the liver and your whole body just goes,

6078
02:42:13,810 --> 02:42:16,440
just locks up and you can kind of like,

6079
02:42:16,740 --> 02:42:17,820
you can kind of fake it.

6080
02:42:17,920 --> 02:42:19,410
You can kind of move around a little bit.

6081
02:42:19,460 --> 02:42:20,570
Sometimes it's hard.

6082
02:42:20,690 --> 02:42:21,070
It's,

6083
02:42:21,070 --> 02:42:21,900
it's horrible.

6084
02:42:21,900 --> 02:42:22,071
You know,

6085
02:42:22,071 --> 02:42:24,360
everyone talks about the
head trauma and fighting,

6086
02:42:24,361 --> 02:42:25,710
but what about the body trauma,

6087
02:42:25,820 --> 02:42:27,210
Oregon Trauma?

6088
02:42:27,690 --> 02:42:29,680
Is there trauma there too?

6089
02:42:29,740 --> 02:42:30,330
It's a good point.

6090
02:42:30,330 --> 02:42:31,170
Maybe there's damage,

6091
02:42:31,180 --> 02:42:33,190
like permanent damage
damage done there too.

6092
02:42:33,600 --> 02:42:38,070
Of course there is in the
chest and the ribs and stomach.

6093
02:42:38,440 --> 02:42:39,480
Imagine Travis Browne,

6094
02:42:39,481 --> 02:42:40,380
Nino in the chest,

6095
02:42:40,410 --> 02:42:42,120
a little kick to the ribs.

6096
02:42:42,330 --> 02:42:44,100
How the fuck does that not
permanently damage you?

6097
02:42:44,101 --> 02:42:44,851
Of course it does.

6098
02:42:44,851 --> 02:42:46,030
Does some this,

6099
02:42:46,260 --> 02:42:47,700
there's gotta be some bleeding in there.

6100
02:42:47,940 --> 02:42:48,391
Okay.

6101
02:42:48,391 --> 02:42:49,440
Now if there's some bleeding there,

6102
02:42:49,441 --> 02:42:50,430
there's some tearing.

6103
02:42:50,640 --> 02:42:54,240
There's tearing is some scar tissue
ripping and tearing and some important

6104
02:42:54,241 --> 02:42:55,830
organs that are getting squashed.

6105
02:42:56,990 --> 02:42:57,823
The wheel kick.

6106
02:42:58,110 --> 02:42:58,650
Yeah,

6107
02:42:58,650 --> 02:42:59,900
it's your liver man.

6108
02:42:59,910 --> 02:43:01,830
Your liver is a big
part of what gets hurt,

6109
02:43:02,100 --> 02:43:04,710
but you get caught with a
turning sidekick to the guts.

6110
02:43:05,220 --> 02:43:06,053
I mean,

6111
02:43:06,690 --> 02:43:08,880
that's horrific for everything,

6112
02:43:09,690 --> 02:43:12,250
especially the way you throw him in

6113
02:43:12,250 --> 02:43:12,520
there.

6114
02:43:12,520 --> 02:43:13,353
Who could survive.

6115
02:43:14,380 --> 02:43:16,950
The only time guys survive it
is if you catch them wrong,

6116
02:43:16,980 --> 02:43:19,870
you catch them with your toes and
you don't catch them with the heel.

6117
02:43:20,080 --> 02:43:21,370
But when they get hit with a heel,

6118
02:43:21,371 --> 02:43:23,170
if you're extending as they get hit,

6119
02:43:23,171 --> 02:43:24,670
it's there so much force.

6120
02:43:25,210 --> 02:43:26,680
It's one of the worst things in the world.

6121
02:43:26,681 --> 02:43:29,950
Kevin Ross survived one in
his last Bellator fight.

6122
02:43:30,040 --> 02:43:33,100
He got nailed like early
seconds of the fight.

6123
02:43:33,520 --> 02:43:36,640
He got nailed with a right to the liver
and he said it was one of the most

6124
02:43:36,641 --> 02:43:38,920
painful things he's ever
experienced in his life.

6125
02:43:39,040 --> 02:43:41,290
You didn't see a god
damn thing and his face,

6126
02:43:41,440 --> 02:43:45,490
he just tucked his arm down and kept
moving and kept fighting and about 20

6127
02:43:45,491 --> 02:43:47,230
seconds later he was 100% recovered.

6128
02:43:47,260 --> 02:43:49,030
How do you see the
evolution of the sport he's,

6129
02:43:49,090 --> 02:43:51,540
you've seen how much it's
evolved over the last what,

6130
02:43:51,640 --> 02:43:52,570
20 years or whatever.

6131
02:43:52,930 --> 02:43:53,331
I mean it's,

6132
02:43:53,331 --> 02:43:54,164
it's crazy.

6133
02:43:54,220 --> 02:43:55,780
Maybe what does the future hold?

6134
02:43:55,870 --> 02:44:00,870
It should keep evolving and maybe one
day instead of two or three guys in the

6135
02:44:01,031 --> 02:44:03,010
UFC with the,

6136
02:44:03,270 --> 02:44:03,520
you know,

6137
02:44:03,520 --> 02:44:05,490
the power of that turn
inside kick in their arsenal.

6138
02:44:05,680 --> 02:44:07,180
Maybe it's just like everyone,

6139
02:44:07,220 --> 02:44:08,140
it will be standard.

6140
02:44:08,500 --> 02:44:11,980
I think 20 years is the front leg side
kick and the turning side kick should be

6141
02:44:11,981 --> 02:44:12,551
standard.

6142
02:44:12,551 --> 02:44:13,810
Just like the front kick is.

6143
02:44:13,811 --> 02:44:15,830
They should be standard
eventually everything.

6144
02:44:15,831 --> 02:44:16,041
Yeah,

6145
02:44:16,041 --> 02:44:18,160
year Rodrigues those will be standard.

6146
02:44:18,210 --> 02:44:20,080
Oh you have to do is learn how to do it.

6147
02:44:20,110 --> 02:44:22,540
Everybody that knows how
to throw a good right hand.

6148
02:44:22,541 --> 02:44:24,040
Everybody knows how to throw a left hook.

6149
02:44:24,070 --> 02:44:25,810
Everybody then knows
how to throw a leg kick.

6150
02:44:26,140 --> 02:44:29,950
You could learn how to throw a perfectly
timed sidekick a perfectly time

6151
02:44:29,951 --> 02:44:30,910
spinning back kick.

6152
02:44:31,120 --> 02:44:32,560
Will you have any legal force?

6153
02:44:33,040 --> 02:44:34,030
I'm not special.

6154
02:44:34,060 --> 02:44:36,070
There's nothing special
about me that I can do it.

6155
02:44:36,071 --> 02:44:37,690
I'm a 49 year old comedian.

6156
02:44:37,990 --> 02:44:38,890
If I can do it.

6157
02:44:38,891 --> 02:44:40,000
You're telling me you can't do it.

6158
02:44:40,030 --> 02:44:41,620
You could totally do it the way I do it.

6159
02:44:41,770 --> 02:44:45,610
All you'd have to do is learn from the
type of instructor that I learned from

6160
02:44:45,700 --> 02:44:49,750
that teaches you perfect technique and
they emphasize that you never fuck with

6161
02:44:49,751 --> 02:44:50,321
that technique.

6162
02:44:50,321 --> 02:44:51,550
You always do it the right way.

6163
02:44:51,670 --> 02:44:52,940
Anybody and these guys can learn.

6164
02:44:52,941 --> 02:44:53,980
10 years ago,

6165
02:44:54,280 --> 02:44:55,990
if some UFC fighter told,

6166
02:44:56,200 --> 02:44:57,600
told you that he's got it,

6167
02:44:57,601 --> 02:45:00,940
he signed for a fight and he's going to
start training on a taekwondo school to

6168
02:45:00,941 --> 02:45:01,810
get ready for his fight.

6169
02:45:02,020 --> 02:45:04,720
You would think he was
crazy using his mind right?

6170
02:45:04,930 --> 02:45:05,471
10 years ago,

6171
02:45:05,471 --> 02:45:06,420
but now,

6172
02:45:07,000 --> 02:45:12,000
now it's not a bad idea to go to your
local taekwondo school and get your spin

6173
02:45:12,461 --> 02:45:13,320
on right.

6174
02:45:13,510 --> 02:45:15,310
Get Your Kung Fu on.

6175
02:45:15,311 --> 02:45:16,144
You know what I'm saying?

6176
02:45:16,840 --> 02:45:19,480
Them spinning kicks just to
get those spinning kicks down.

6177
02:45:20,050 --> 02:45:21,320
Oh look it

6178
02:45:23,980 --> 02:45:24,910
dropping bombs.

6179
02:45:24,911 --> 02:45:26,080
Travis is in trouble,

6180
02:45:26,230 --> 02:45:26,591
but he's,

6181
02:45:26,591 --> 02:45:27,730
he's got a lot of heart though.

6182
02:45:28,730 --> 02:45:29,830
He's hanging in there,

6183
02:45:29,940 --> 02:45:30,460
hanging in there,

6184
02:45:30,460 --> 02:45:31,340
but he's got,

6185
02:45:31,420 --> 02:45:32,290
his legs are going.

6186
02:45:33,000 --> 02:45:34,430
Oh Shit.

6187
02:45:34,580 --> 02:45:35,413
Oh,

6188
02:45:35,530 --> 02:45:36,400
he's got to move.

6189
02:45:36,590 --> 02:45:37,600
He's trying to move.

6190
02:45:37,601 --> 02:45:38,201
He's trying to move.

6191
02:45:38,201 --> 02:45:39,280
He's hanging on there.

6192
02:45:40,800 --> 02:45:41,830
Holy Shit.

6193
02:45:41,831 --> 02:45:43,300
Standing Cocoon right there.

6194
02:45:43,360 --> 02:45:44,560
Holy Shit.

6195
02:45:45,160 --> 02:45:45,940
Here we go.

6196
02:45:45,940 --> 02:45:47,110
Oh,

6197
02:45:47,111 --> 02:45:47,591
what are you doing,

6198
02:45:47,591 --> 02:45:48,011
Travis?

6199
02:45:48,011 --> 02:45:48,430
Come on.

6200
02:45:48,430 --> 02:45:48,731
Oh,

6201
02:45:48,731 --> 02:45:49,310
Jesus.

6202
02:45:49,310 --> 02:45:50,410
Trapman should've kept that.

6203
02:45:51,390 --> 02:45:51,971
Oh Man.

6204
02:45:51,971 --> 02:45:52,660
He's hurt.

6205
02:45:52,660 --> 02:45:53,141
He's hurt.

6206
02:45:53,141 --> 02:45:54,070
He's still kicking

6207
02:45:56,150 --> 02:45:56,860
to the body.

6208
02:45:56,860 --> 02:45:57,790
Beautiful Shot.

6209
02:45:57,850 --> 02:45:57,971
Yeah,

6210
02:45:57,971 --> 02:45:58,804
he's still in this.

6211
02:45:58,810 --> 02:46:00,130
Oh my God.

6212
02:46:00,280 --> 02:46:01,420
This is incredible,

6213
02:46:02,410 --> 02:46:02,890
dude.

6214
02:46:02,890 --> 02:46:04,270
Remember that Overeem fight,

6215
02:46:04,271 --> 02:46:04,481
man,

6216
02:46:04,481 --> 02:46:05,470
remember that ovary and fight?

6217
02:46:05,471 --> 02:46:08,350
He was down and out and he
came back and knocked him out.

6218
02:46:08,620 --> 02:46:09,840
Travis Brown's a form.

6219
02:46:09,870 --> 02:46:10,310
All

6220
02:46:10,310 --> 02:46:10,971
big mistake.

6221
02:46:10,971 --> 02:46:11,810
Big Mistake.

6222
02:46:12,350 --> 02:46:13,040
What the fuck?

6223
02:46:13,040 --> 02:46:13,560
Oh,

6224
02:46:13,560 --> 02:46:14,660
huge mistake.

6225
02:46:15,140 --> 02:46:17,180
He just pulled them in at mount half.

6226
02:46:17,210 --> 02:46:18,630
Now he's just too tired to,

6227
02:46:18,660 --> 02:46:21,190
he wasn't always getting dailed.

6228
02:46:21,920 --> 02:46:22,581
He's in trouble,

6229
02:46:22,581 --> 02:46:22,941
man.

6230
02:46:22,941 --> 02:46:23,774
He's got to use that.

6231
02:46:23,810 --> 02:46:24,561
Use that under hook.

6232
02:46:24,561 --> 02:46:25,221
Get back up.

6233
02:46:25,221 --> 02:46:25,881
Don't stop.

6234
02:46:25,881 --> 02:46:26,481
Don't stop.

6235
02:46:26,481 --> 02:46:27,051
Keep going.

6236
02:46:27,051 --> 02:46:27,650
Keep going.

6237
02:46:27,650 --> 02:46:28,221
Keep going.

6238
02:46:28,221 --> 02:46:28,821
Keep going.

6239
02:46:28,821 --> 02:46:29,654
Keep going.

6240
02:46:29,850 --> 02:46:30,683
Derrick Lewis.

6241
02:46:30,750 --> 02:46:31,583
Oh,

6242
02:46:32,120 --> 02:46:34,680
Derek glues takes him back down again.

6243
02:46:34,770 --> 02:46:35,560
Wow.

6244
02:46:35,560 --> 02:46:36,393
Whew.

6245
02:46:36,450 --> 02:46:37,200
Christ.

6246
02:46:37,200 --> 02:46:38,070
Holy Shit.

6247
02:46:38,071 --> 02:46:38,970
This is a great fight.

6248
02:46:39,100 --> 02:46:39,933
Okay.

6249
02:46:41,860 --> 02:46:42,790
Damn.

6250
02:46:43,120 --> 02:46:44,620
Two 30 to go.

6251
02:46:44,740 --> 02:46:45,940
Ooh.

6252
02:46:46,270 --> 02:46:47,830
Halfway point baby.

6253
02:46:49,210 --> 02:46:51,550
Sometimes the best time
to take someone down as,

6254
02:46:51,970 --> 02:46:52,803
as they're getting up.

6255
02:46:53,320 --> 02:46:54,041
Oh Shit.

6256
02:46:54,041 --> 02:46:54,401
What happened?

6257
02:46:54,401 --> 02:46:54,850
Yeah.

6258
02:46:54,850 --> 02:46:55,061
Oh,

6259
02:46:55,061 --> 02:46:56,620
big elbows by Louis.

6260
02:46:59,850 --> 02:47:00,231
Damn.

6261
02:47:00,231 --> 02:47:01,530
Like I know anything about tank down.

6262
02:47:01,550 --> 02:47:03,000
This is a big fucking when if,

6263
02:47:03,030 --> 02:47:04,470
if Louis winds up winning here.

6264
02:47:04,500 --> 02:47:05,520
Holy Shit.

6265
02:47:05,910 --> 02:47:06,870
Woo.

6266
02:47:08,610 --> 02:47:08,791
Oh,

6267
02:47:08,791 --> 02:47:10,030
I thought I was going to go to the dark.

6268
02:47:11,340 --> 02:47:11,760
Yeah,

6269
02:47:11,760 --> 02:47:12,380
exactly.

6270
02:47:12,380 --> 02:47:13,011
Beautifully lit.

6271
02:47:13,011 --> 02:47:13,844
Back Up.

6272
02:47:13,850 --> 02:47:14,683
Back Up.

6273
02:47:14,690 --> 02:47:16,220
That's a professional get up.

6274
02:47:16,280 --> 02:47:17,900
That's a professional job as brown.

6275
02:47:17,901 --> 02:47:21,350
Two minutes to go with
around what a fucking round.

6276
02:47:21,920 --> 02:47:23,020
Oh my God.

6277
02:47:26,000 --> 02:47:26,890
Oh Shit.

6278
02:47:27,590 --> 02:47:28,191
It looks like it's,

6279
02:47:28,191 --> 02:47:29,024
he got clipped.

6280
02:47:29,070 --> 02:47:29,903
That's it.

6281
02:47:31,160 --> 02:47:31,993
Stop it.

6282
02:47:32,800 --> 02:47:33,740
Oh my God.

6283
02:47:33,741 --> 02:47:35,030
You took too many shots.

6284
02:47:35,070 --> 02:47:36,200
Took too many shots.

6285
02:47:36,260 --> 02:47:37,400
Three too many right there.

6286
02:47:38,600 --> 02:47:40,430
That's a big win for Derrick Lewis though.

6287
02:47:40,431 --> 02:47:41,241
Holy Shit.

6288
02:47:41,241 --> 02:47:43,000
What a fight to survive those.

6289
02:47:44,470 --> 02:47:45,470
Goddamn fine.

6290
02:47:45,710 --> 02:47:49,730
Have we ever seen a fight like that with
those body shots and the way they were

6291
02:47:49,731 --> 02:47:54,470
landing in and all the drama he was
standing there holding his stomach.

6292
02:47:54,680 --> 02:47:55,130
Wow.

6293
02:47:55,130 --> 02:47:56,620
We've never really seen that one.

6294
02:47:56,630 --> 02:47:57,321
That one fight.

6295
02:47:57,321 --> 02:47:57,681
Fuck.

6296
02:47:57,681 --> 02:47:57,981
Yay.

6297
02:47:57,981 --> 02:47:59,060
Did what?

6298
02:47:59,061 --> 02:48:03,680
A fire and that fire fight and what a
what a victory for him to the way he ended

6299
02:48:03,681 --> 02:48:04,491
it to stop them.

6300
02:48:04,491 --> 02:48:05,810
Knock them out cold like that.

6301
02:48:05,910 --> 02:48:06,530
Yeah.

6302
02:48:06,530 --> 02:48:08,780
It's terrible that he
took those extra shots,

6303
02:48:09,050 --> 02:48:10,410
but I didn't know chipotle.

6304
02:48:10,411 --> 02:48:11,630
I for four to six weeks.

6305
02:48:11,720 --> 02:48:13,580
That is definitive as it gets.

6306
02:48:13,581 --> 02:48:13,880
Why?

6307
02:48:13,880 --> 02:48:14,713
Why'd you put,

6308
02:48:15,110 --> 02:48:15,770
I dunno.

6309
02:48:15,770 --> 02:48:16,603
What does that mean?

6310
02:48:19,310 --> 02:48:20,210
I don't understand.

6311
02:48:20,420 --> 02:48:21,410
Let's see that again.

6312
02:48:21,770 --> 02:48:24,260
Do Travis Brown tried to
tried to hang in there,

6313
02:48:24,261 --> 02:48:24,561
man,

6314
02:48:24,561 --> 02:48:25,394
but look at this,

6315
02:48:28,260 --> 02:48:28,970
right?

6316
02:48:28,970 --> 02:48:29,481
Boom.

6317
02:48:29,481 --> 02:48:30,620
He catches him with that name.

6318
02:48:30,860 --> 02:48:31,131
Paulo.

6319
02:48:31,131 --> 02:48:31,791
There's the left.

6320
02:48:31,791 --> 02:48:32,870
The left really hurt him,

6321
02:48:33,380 --> 02:48:33,801
Joe.

6322
02:48:33,801 --> 02:48:34,880
He's just winging them.

6323
02:48:35,030 --> 02:48:35,751
Oh,

6324
02:48:35,751 --> 02:48:36,584
look at that right hand.

6325
02:48:36,860 --> 02:48:37,693
That's Oh,

6326
02:48:37,830 --> 02:48:38,690
beautiful.

6327
02:48:39,050 --> 02:48:39,680
Beautiful.

6328
02:48:39,680 --> 02:48:41,810
Like going around the guard.

6329
02:48:41,870 --> 02:48:43,340
Good placement of his punches.

6330
02:48:43,390 --> 02:48:44,223
Look at this.

6331
02:48:44,380 --> 02:48:45,080
Boom.

6332
02:48:45,080 --> 02:48:46,430
Right elbow.

6333
02:48:46,730 --> 02:48:47,930
That was an elbow right there.

6334
02:48:49,040 --> 02:48:49,701
Boom.

6335
02:48:49,701 --> 02:48:50,181
Here it is.

6336
02:48:50,181 --> 02:48:51,014
Boom,

6337
02:48:51,020 --> 02:48:51,800
boom,

6338
02:48:51,800 --> 02:48:52,281
boom,

6339
02:48:52,281 --> 02:48:53,114
boom,

6340
02:48:53,300 --> 02:48:54,133
boom.

6341
02:48:54,140 --> 02:48:55,820
Like right there he could have stopped.

6342
02:48:55,821 --> 02:48:58,340
That fight is totally unnecessary.

6343
02:48:58,341 --> 02:48:59,540
The last few shots,

6344
02:49:00,120 --> 02:49:02,090
let's see if they even
show the last few shots.

6345
02:49:02,140 --> 02:49:03,200
Like boom,

6346
02:49:03,201 --> 02:49:04,010
right there.

6347
02:49:04,010 --> 02:49:05,240
That fight is over.

6348
02:49:05,450 --> 02:49:06,050
Like doubt.

6349
02:49:06,050 --> 02:49:08,460
Those are two completely unnecessary

6350
02:49:08,460 --> 02:49:09,293
shots.

6351
02:49:09,540 --> 02:49:11,250
That referee should
have jumped in earlier.

6352
02:49:11,280 --> 02:49:12,113
Yeah,

6353
02:49:12,360 --> 02:49:13,500
that's unnecessary.

6354
02:49:13,550 --> 02:49:14,580
It's unnecessary.

6355
02:49:14,760 --> 02:49:16,740
But Travis is known for coming back.

6356
02:49:16,770 --> 02:49:17,980
It's true brain,

6357
02:49:18,090 --> 02:49:18,841
but he wasn't,

6358
02:49:18,841 --> 02:49:19,920
there was no break anymore.

6359
02:49:19,921 --> 02:49:20,754
He was done.

6360
02:49:20,970 --> 02:49:21,803
He was gone.

6361
02:49:22,200 --> 02:49:24,600
He was unconscious when he
took those last two shots.

6362
02:49:25,290 --> 02:49:26,850
But Fuck Derrick Lewis.

6363
02:49:27,330 --> 02:49:27,751
Damn,

6364
02:49:27,751 --> 02:49:29,040
he's good to,

6365
02:49:29,041 --> 02:49:30,420
who's tougher than that guy?

6366
02:49:30,421 --> 02:49:31,254
Man.

6367
02:49:31,680 --> 02:49:32,011
Fuck.

6368
02:49:32,011 --> 02:49:32,844
That was awesome.

6369
02:49:32,910 --> 02:49:33,810
Each those shots,

6370
02:49:33,811 --> 02:49:35,700
the body survives,

6371
02:49:35,790 --> 02:49:37,590
comes back and knocks him
out in the next round.

6372
02:49:38,520 --> 02:49:39,353
Wow.

6373
02:49:40,890 --> 02:49:44,160
I was super impressed with him in the
Roy Nelson fight because I felt like in

6374
02:49:44,161 --> 02:49:45,180
the Roy Nelson fight,

6375
02:49:45,181 --> 02:49:47,400
like Roy throws big bombs.

6376
02:49:47,401 --> 02:49:48,900
He's a strong guy.

6377
02:49:49,080 --> 02:49:49,381
I was like,

6378
02:49:49,381 --> 02:49:50,370
this could be an interesting fight.

6379
02:49:50,371 --> 02:49:53,010
He'd get tested like
Derrick Lewis get tested,

6380
02:49:53,130 --> 02:49:56,970
but instead he just overwhelmed Roy and
he was throwing nasty combinations in

6381
02:49:56,971 --> 02:50:01,740
his conditioning was so apparent and
there was a big change in his conditioning

6382
02:50:02,310 --> 02:50:03,021
and he,

6383
02:50:03,021 --> 02:50:03,930
he even addressed it.

6384
02:50:03,931 --> 02:50:04,661
He was talking about it.

6385
02:50:04,661 --> 02:50:05,100
I just,

6386
02:50:05,100 --> 02:50:08,700
he realized at a certain point in time
that if he wants to compete at the upper

6387
02:50:08,701 --> 02:50:09,300
levels,

6388
02:50:09,300 --> 02:50:10,590
he's got to have the gas tank.

6389
02:50:10,980 --> 02:50:12,120
So you see it now with him,

6390
02:50:12,121 --> 02:50:12,954
man.

6391
02:50:13,170 --> 02:50:13,471
Fuck.

6392
02:50:13,471 --> 02:50:14,310
That was crazy.

6393
02:50:16,380 --> 02:50:17,213
Perfect.

6394
02:50:17,560 --> 02:50:19,030
What a nutty division man.

6395
02:50:20,440 --> 02:50:24,040
The heavyweight division is just so
different than any other division because

6396
02:50:24,041 --> 02:50:28,600
there are so fucking big and they hit
so hard and even though they're big and

6397
02:50:28,601 --> 02:50:29,680
they can take more,

6398
02:50:29,830 --> 02:50:33,370
you just know in the heavyweight division
one crazy punch and everything's all

6399
02:50:33,371 --> 02:50:34,204
fucked up,

6400
02:50:34,330 --> 02:50:37,150
you know one way or the
other like that was,

6401
02:50:37,240 --> 02:50:39,370
that was a fight that
could have gone either way.

6402
02:50:39,430 --> 02:50:40,240
Right.

6403
02:50:40,240 --> 02:50:42,250
I mean that flight was
going back and forth,

6404
02:50:44,170 --> 02:50:46,180
body and the head crazy.

6405
02:50:47,650 --> 02:50:48,483
It's just

6406
02:50:49,460 --> 02:50:50,293
the overview.

6407
02:50:51,570 --> 02:50:52,403
It's,

6408
02:50:52,440 --> 02:50:55,460
it's interesting that the
heavyweight division right now,

6409
02:50:55,880 --> 02:50:56,870
there's not like,

6410
02:50:57,200 --> 02:51:00,230
I mean there's the big fight
between steeping junior dos Santos,

6411
02:51:00,231 --> 02:51:03,560
which is probably going to be some crazy
war judge them by their first fight,

6412
02:51:03,950 --> 02:51:06,050
but there's not like
clear fights after that.

6413
02:51:06,260 --> 02:51:11,180
It's not like one 85 you got Yo
Romero who's waiting right behind him,

6414
02:51:11,181 --> 02:51:12,380
shock array waiting.

6415
02:51:12,410 --> 02:51:14,660
Either one of those guys could be fighting
for the title right now and it would

6416
02:51:14,661 --> 02:51:15,500
make a good argument,

6417
02:51:15,530 --> 02:51:16,040
you know?

6418
02:51:16,040 --> 02:51:16,640
Yeah.

6419
02:51:16,640 --> 02:51:19,460
All of the other divisions
are stacked us as hell.

6420
02:51:19,820 --> 02:51:22,250
The heavyweight division
looks better than ever,

6421
02:51:22,760 --> 02:51:27,760
but it still doesn't compare
it to like 55 70 and even 85.

6422
02:51:28,010 --> 02:51:29,510
There's so many fights,

6423
02:51:29,511 --> 02:51:30,710
so many awesome fights.

6424
02:51:31,070 --> 02:51:32,330
You know what I think though,

6425
02:51:32,390 --> 02:51:34,100
if there's one guy that stands out,

6426
02:51:34,130 --> 02:51:35,390
it's Francis and Ghana,

6427
02:51:35,840 --> 02:51:38,060
that guy stands out as
like one of the scariest.

6428
02:51:38,240 --> 02:51:38,571
He's,

6429
02:51:38,571 --> 02:51:39,830
he seems scary to me.

6430
02:51:40,250 --> 02:51:41,083
Like I would,

6431
02:51:41,140 --> 02:51:43,430
and I would wonder if they
would make this fight,

6432
02:51:43,880 --> 02:51:46,910
but I would love to see if
Cain gets super healthy.

6433
02:51:47,630 --> 02:51:47,891
Uh,

6434
02:51:47,891 --> 02:51:51,680
if Cain is surgery successful and
he feels good when he comes back,

6435
02:51:51,681 --> 02:51:53,900
I would love to see Cain vs in Ghana.

6436
02:51:53,930 --> 02:51:54,590
I want to see,

6437
02:51:54,590 --> 02:51:56,720
is the Brazilian in Ghana?

6438
02:51:56,750 --> 02:51:57,111
No.

6439
02:51:57,111 --> 02:51:57,291
No.

6440
02:51:57,291 --> 02:51:58,124
He's African.

6441
02:51:58,320 --> 02:51:59,510
He was a big French guy.

6442
02:51:59,570 --> 02:51:59,880
Yeah.

6443
02:51:59,880 --> 02:52:01,550
Where is he lives in Paris.

6444
02:52:01,551 --> 02:52:04,040
But we said the wrong country last time.

6445
02:52:04,041 --> 02:52:06,010
I think we said Kim Nigeria
and he's from Cameroon.

6446
02:52:06,011 --> 02:52:06,710
Is that what it is?

6447
02:52:06,710 --> 02:52:06,880
Yeah,

6448
02:52:06,880 --> 02:52:07,300
I think so.

6449
02:52:07,300 --> 02:52:08,500
He's a fucking beast.

6450
02:52:08,710 --> 02:52:09,543
Jesus.

6451
02:52:09,610 --> 02:52:09,880
Ooh,

6452
02:52:09,880 --> 02:52:10,281
scary.

6453
02:52:10,281 --> 02:52:11,380
That dude's a nightmare.

6454
02:52:11,800 --> 02:52:11,981
Oh,

6455
02:52:11,981 --> 02:52:12,814
he's so big.

6456
02:52:13,390 --> 02:52:14,560
I wonder if they do in God.

6457
02:52:14,561 --> 02:52:14,651
Oh,

6458
02:52:14,651 --> 02:52:16,000
versus Derrick Lewis.

6459
02:52:16,150 --> 02:52:18,280
That could be crazy to good lord.

6460
02:52:18,880 --> 02:52:19,151
Yeah.

6461
02:52:19,151 --> 02:52:19,984
Someone's going,

6462
02:52:20,050 --> 02:52:21,340
someone's going to see
it's going night night.

6463
02:52:23,440 --> 02:52:23,981
He's hurt,

6464
02:52:23,981 --> 02:52:24,580
man.

6465
02:52:24,580 --> 02:52:24,791
Okay.

6466
02:52:24,791 --> 02:52:25,021
He's,

6467
02:52:25,021 --> 02:52:26,770
he's still hurting us holding inside.

6468
02:52:28,000 --> 02:52:28,630
Wow.

6469
02:52:28,630 --> 02:52:28,980
Yeah.

6470
02:52:28,980 --> 02:52:29,290
That's a,

6471
02:52:29,290 --> 02:52:30,880
that's a tough dude right there.

6472
02:52:31,180 --> 02:52:34,510
He kinda crazy nickname to
the black beast for real.

6473
02:52:34,520 --> 02:52:35,353
You want to go with that,

6474
02:52:35,880 --> 02:52:36,870
like to win.

6475
02:52:37,230 --> 02:52:37,420
Let,

6476
02:52:37,420 --> 02:52:38,410
if he wins the title.

6477
02:52:38,890 --> 02:52:39,310
Well,

6478
02:52:39,310 --> 02:52:42,130
we still have the black beast as the
heavyweight champion and he comes out with

6479
02:52:42,131 --> 02:52:45,550
a fucking crazy outfit
on like a pro wrestler.

6480
02:52:46,060 --> 02:52:47,140
Black beast.

6481
02:52:47,970 --> 02:52:50,770
What a crazy nickname you can have.

6482
02:52:50,771 --> 02:52:52,150
Whatever the fuck nick
that he wants to know.

6483
02:52:52,180 --> 02:52:53,013
Don't get me wrong.

6484
02:52:54,490 --> 02:52:55,131
God Damn,

6485
02:52:55,131 --> 02:52:56,080
he's tough man.

6486
02:52:56,380 --> 02:52:57,250
Just Bang.

6487
02:52:57,280 --> 02:53:01,360
Ooh Man.

6488
02:53:01,900 --> 02:53:03,430
I'd like to see that in slow Mo.

6489
02:53:03,610 --> 02:53:07,640
It seemed like he just caught him in
the solar plexus or something or caught

6490
02:53:07,641 --> 02:53:08,650
them like under the rib.

6491
02:53:10,480 --> 02:53:11,620
Really interesting man.

6492
02:53:12,340 --> 02:53:13,173
The division,

6493
02:53:13,470 --> 02:53:14,100
what'd he say?

6494
02:53:14,100 --> 02:53:14,500
What?

6495
02:53:14,500 --> 02:53:16,990
Most knockouts in UFC heavyweight history.

6496
02:53:16,991 --> 02:53:21,991
He's already third crazy as that
loungers number nine history.

6497
02:53:22,960 --> 02:53:24,070
That's is crazy.

6498
02:53:25,300 --> 02:53:25,940
That's not,

6499
02:53:25,940 --> 02:53:27,430
he's only a couple away from the record.

6500
02:53:28,960 --> 02:53:31,720
There's a that there's
a lot of fights for him,

6501
02:53:31,800 --> 02:53:33,460
a lot of fights for
him at heavyweight now,

6502
02:53:34,270 --> 02:53:35,470
but I feel like I'm

6503
02:53:37,270 --> 02:53:40,240
in Ghana and Cain Velasquez
is some shit that I'd like.

6504
02:53:40,270 --> 02:53:43,600
I'd like to find out what's going
on and I think fighting or who was,

6505
02:53:43,780 --> 02:53:46,090
I think I'd heard that
it was a potential fight.

6506
02:53:46,300 --> 02:53:48,690
Rumble Johnson has heard that online,

6507
02:53:48,691 --> 02:53:49,490
right?

6508
02:53:49,490 --> 02:53:49,600
Oh,

6509
02:53:49,600 --> 02:53:50,440
he could do it though.

6510
02:53:50,950 --> 02:53:52,570
He could do it when
we're talking about it.

6511
02:53:52,710 --> 02:53:52,870
Well,

6512
02:53:52,870 --> 02:53:56,650
he fought heavyweight outside
the UFC did knock 'em out.

6513
02:53:57,160 --> 02:53:57,430
No,

6514
02:53:57,430 --> 02:53:58,270
he wanted decision.

6515
02:53:58,320 --> 02:54:00,730
My Gpa dropped them in the first
round of broke his jaw though.

6516
02:54:00,731 --> 02:54:03,610
So horrifically that his jaw was
like literally one of these things,

6517
02:54:03,850 --> 02:54:05,350
whether your teeth up.

6518
02:54:05,410 --> 02:54:06,230
Have you ever seen it?

6519
02:54:06,230 --> 02:54:07,630
I remember it happening.

6520
02:54:07,960 --> 02:54:08,890
It was so nasty.

6521
02:54:09,310 --> 02:54:10,121
The pictures of it,

6522
02:54:10,121 --> 02:54:12,370
the fact that he,

6523
02:54:12,730 --> 02:54:16,900
he did it and he did in the first
round and then they want fighting,

6524
02:54:17,170 --> 02:54:19,810
fighting the rest of
the fight like that now.

6525
02:54:20,290 --> 02:54:20,411
Yeah.

6526
02:54:20,411 --> 02:54:25,330
That's crazy to get your job broken then
punched again after it's broken half

6527
02:54:25,590 --> 02:54:26,710
like it's maybe like,

6528
02:54:26,711 --> 02:54:27,550
it doesn't hurt as bad,

6529
02:54:28,660 --> 02:54:29,493
just go numb.

6530
02:54:29,500 --> 02:54:31,630
You just got to split
splitting up a whole,

6531
02:54:31,670 --> 02:54:32,620
can I hit with a bat?

6532
02:54:32,621 --> 02:54:33,200
It's fine.

6533
02:54:33,200 --> 02:54:34,960
Because people have
fought like that before.

6534
02:54:35,050 --> 02:54:35,883
Oh,

6535
02:54:36,160 --> 02:54:38,850
Kim coture did that and she split her job.

6536
02:54:39,400 --> 02:54:39,940
Right.

6537
02:54:39,940 --> 02:54:40,300
Broken.

6538
02:54:40,300 --> 02:54:42,640
That's where it breaks on some
people right in the middle.

6539
02:54:43,450 --> 02:54:44,830
So crazy.

6540
02:54:44,870 --> 02:54:48,790
She finished force that you have to
have to break your jaw and people still

6541
02:54:48,791 --> 02:54:49,421
fight like that.

6542
02:54:49,421 --> 02:54:50,650
And her split to like,

6543
02:54:50,880 --> 02:54:51,880
he was bleeding.

6544
02:54:51,970 --> 02:54:52,211
Yeah.

6545
02:54:52,211 --> 02:54:52,990
One up.

6546
02:54:52,990 --> 02:54:53,823
One down.

6547
02:54:54,010 --> 02:54:54,251
Yeah.

6548
02:54:54,251 --> 02:54:55,270
It was horrific.

6549
02:54:55,390 --> 02:54:56,141
It that Vegas,

6550
02:54:56,141 --> 02:54:56,974
I think it was she.

6551
02:54:57,280 --> 02:54:57,701
Fuck,

6552
02:54:57,701 --> 02:54:58,750
that's got to hurt so bad.

6553
02:54:59,640 --> 02:55:00,473
That's your face.

6554
02:55:02,350 --> 02:55:04,040
So this is it,

6555
02:55:04,041 --> 02:55:04,910
ladies and gentlemen.

6556
02:55:05,240 --> 02:55:05,780
Yes.

6557
02:55:05,780 --> 02:55:09,980
This should probably be the end of this
broadcast is probably one of our most

6558
02:55:09,981 --> 02:55:11,570
boring fight companions ever.

6559
02:55:11,690 --> 02:55:14,720
I don't know why we just mellow.

6560
02:55:14,721 --> 02:55:16,340
There was controversy.

6561
02:55:16,370 --> 02:55:17,203
That's right.

6562
02:55:18,020 --> 02:55:18,800
That's right.

6563
02:55:18,800 --> 02:55:19,633
That's right.

6564
02:55:19,700 --> 02:55:22,130
And very little marijuana until deep in.

6565
02:55:22,430 --> 02:55:23,090
Yeah.

6566
02:55:23,090 --> 02:55:23,960
But Derrick Lewis,

6567
02:55:23,961 --> 02:55:24,171
I mean,

6568
02:55:24,171 --> 02:55:24,981
he's gotta be like,

6569
02:55:24,981 --> 02:55:25,461
what do you think?

6570
02:55:25,461 --> 02:55:27,500
Like top three contenders now,

6571
02:55:27,501 --> 02:55:27,860
right?

6572
02:55:27,860 --> 02:55:28,280
Yeah.

6573
02:55:28,280 --> 02:55:28,640
I mean,

6574
02:55:28,640 --> 02:55:29,690
you got it for doom.

6575
02:55:29,990 --> 02:55:32,660
Dosantos um,

6576
02:55:33,350 --> 02:55:34,340
who else?

6577
02:55:34,700 --> 02:55:35,540
Frances and gone.

6578
02:55:35,541 --> 02:55:36,620
It was like top 10 now,

6579
02:55:36,621 --> 02:55:36,861
right?

6580
02:55:36,861 --> 02:55:38,480
He's like six or seven
or something like that.

6581
02:55:38,481 --> 02:55:39,980
He's got to be like number three or four.

6582
02:55:40,360 --> 02:55:40,520
Yeah,

6583
02:55:40,520 --> 02:55:41,300
I would imagine.

6584
02:55:41,300 --> 02:55:42,133
Derrick Lewis.

6585
02:55:42,260 --> 02:55:43,460
It's a big wind farm man.

6586
02:55:44,160 --> 02:55:44,993
Just do it like that.

6587
02:55:45,080 --> 02:55:45,400
It's good.

6588
02:55:45,400 --> 02:55:46,233
What's that?

6589
02:55:47,010 --> 02:55:47,843
You got to go back to,

6590
02:55:47,900 --> 02:55:48,141
I mean,

6591
02:55:48,141 --> 02:55:51,560
it's amazing when early in his career
he got heel kicked in the head.

6592
02:55:51,830 --> 02:55:54,360
Remember he got hooked
kicked by Sean Doors.

6593
02:55:55,040 --> 02:55:56,330
Sean Jordan Hook kicked him.

6594
02:55:56,900 --> 02:55:57,441
It's crazy.

6595
02:55:57,441 --> 02:55:58,970
The way he did it to mitre owned,

6596
02:55:58,971 --> 02:55:59,630
starched him.

6597
02:55:59,630 --> 02:56:00,920
Remember I sent that,

6598
02:56:00,921 --> 02:56:02,300
I sent him a picture of,

6599
02:56:02,301 --> 02:56:02,540
you know,

6600
02:56:02,540 --> 02:56:03,230
remember that ad,

6601
02:56:03,230 --> 02:56:04,910
the hippo enhancing hippo.

6602
02:56:04,990 --> 02:56:05,823
Yeah.

6603
02:56:05,840 --> 02:56:06,830
After he hit that he'll kick.

6604
02:56:06,831 --> 02:56:09,830
I said in that picture that
like good job did well,

6605
02:56:09,831 --> 02:56:12,320
he's a crazy athlete for
like as big as he is.

6606
02:56:12,530 --> 02:56:15,680
Sean Jordan could do back flips
and he's 260 pounds round.

6607
02:56:15,770 --> 02:56:16,041
Yeah.

6608
02:56:16,041 --> 02:56:17,810
He said he's a fic motherfucker,

6609
02:56:18,350 --> 02:56:19,340
but he uh,

6610
02:56:19,550 --> 02:56:21,800
he stopped Derrick Lewis
with a hook kick to the face.

6611
02:56:21,810 --> 02:56:25,550
One of the only hook kick Kaos we
didn't Koom with the hook kick,

6612
02:56:25,551 --> 02:56:28,070
but put him on Queer Street and
then he put them away afterwards.

6613
02:56:29,090 --> 02:56:33,200
But that's such a weird technique
for a giant dude to throw,

6614
02:56:33,280 --> 02:56:33,610
you know,

6615
02:56:33,610 --> 02:56:34,310
it was like his,

6616
02:56:34,310 --> 02:56:34,850
his,

6617
02:56:34,850 --> 02:56:37,250
his head was lower than his ass.

6618
02:56:37,940 --> 02:56:38,773
Yeah,

6619
02:56:38,780 --> 02:56:39,613
exactly.

6620
02:56:40,190 --> 02:56:40,461
Yeah.

6621
02:56:40,461 --> 02:56:42,380
And he just sort of
swung his leg out there,

6622
02:56:42,381 --> 02:56:43,910
but it landed perfect.

6623
02:56:44,030 --> 02:56:44,450
Was,

6624
02:56:44,450 --> 02:56:46,640
and then mitre owned stopped him again.

6625
02:56:46,880 --> 02:56:50,030
I was so bummed out about yesterday
about the fate or fight not happening.

6626
02:56:50,750 --> 02:56:52,160
That was such a bummer man.

6627
02:56:52,700 --> 02:56:55,430
They pulled mitre on the day of
the fight with a kidney stone.

6628
02:56:57,130 --> 02:56:59,570
What the day of the fight.

6629
02:57:00,290 --> 02:57:01,060
Yeah.

6630
02:57:01,060 --> 02:57:05,630
And apparently they offered it to check
Congo and he said he would do it fade or

6631
02:57:05,631 --> 02:57:09,890
said no and they offered it to the
other guy that check Congo FOBT and fit.

6632
02:57:09,891 --> 02:57:10,220
I was like,

6633
02:57:10,220 --> 02:57:10,520
Nope,

6634
02:57:10,520 --> 02:57:11,540
I'm going to wait for mitre own.

6635
02:57:12,530 --> 02:57:14,210
They just going to run it back.

6636
02:57:14,600 --> 02:57:15,560
Russians or civil year.

6637
02:57:15,950 --> 02:57:16,341
Well,

6638
02:57:16,341 --> 02:57:17,174
I mean,

6639
02:57:17,350 --> 02:57:17,991
but I got,

6640
02:57:17,991 --> 02:57:18,140
yeah.

6641
02:57:18,140 --> 02:57:18,973
Got Your money.

6642
02:57:19,280 --> 02:57:20,200
Do you think he gets paid?

6643
02:57:20,201 --> 02:57:21,170
He that was your point.

6644
02:57:21,200 --> 02:57:21,361
Yeah.

6645
02:57:21,361 --> 02:57:22,520
Like free money.

6646
02:57:22,580 --> 02:57:23,413
Yeah.

6647
02:57:23,600 --> 02:57:25,010
I get what you get at that trained.

6648
02:57:25,040 --> 02:57:25,240
Yeah.

6649
02:57:25,240 --> 02:57:27,860
I mean you already trained there
had to be some sort of a clause.

6650
02:57:27,910 --> 02:57:28,060
Yeah,

6651
02:57:28,060 --> 02:57:28,341
totally.

6652
02:57:28,341 --> 02:57:29,174
Makes Sense.

6653
02:57:30,860 --> 02:57:31,880
Totally makes sense.

6654
02:57:33,440 --> 02:57:35,420
This is just a crazy fight,

6655
02:57:35,421 --> 02:57:36,020
man.

6656
02:57:36,020 --> 02:57:40,610
I mean this is as close to getting
stopped as anybody has ever gotten to come

6657
02:57:40,611 --> 02:57:43,090
back and win by four Roche's knock out.

6658
02:57:43,430 --> 02:57:48,430
I mean this is right up there with check
Kongo versus Pat Barry except Congo did

6659
02:57:48,441 --> 02:57:49,274
it with one shot.

6660
02:57:49,670 --> 02:57:50,870
Oh this is nuts.

6661
02:57:54,200 --> 02:57:55,033
Wow.

6662
02:57:55,040 --> 02:57:55,671
Boom,

6663
02:57:55,671 --> 02:57:56,270
boom,

6664
02:57:56,270 --> 02:57:56,930
boom,

6665
02:57:56,930 --> 02:57:57,201
boom,

6666
02:57:57,201 --> 02:57:57,730
boom.

6667
02:57:57,730 --> 02:57:59,900
See he just on everything.

6668
02:58:00,260 --> 02:58:02,640
Oh yeah.

6669
02:58:02,670 --> 02:58:07,500
See two completely at the very least
to completely unnecessary shots.

6670
02:58:07,740 --> 02:58:08,990
He could have stopped it all off a lot.

6671
02:58:08,991 --> 02:58:09,280
Yeah,

6672
02:58:09,280 --> 02:58:10,113
a lot earlier than that.

6673
02:58:10,410 --> 02:58:12,000
But they also get to edit it out too.

6674
02:58:12,001 --> 02:58:12,834
And I keep showing it.

6675
02:58:13,140 --> 02:58:13,710
Yeah.

6676
02:58:13,710 --> 02:58:18,710
Well we were talking earlier about one
day someone having all the techniques.

6677
02:58:19,380 --> 02:58:21,390
Those kids are out
there right now I think.

6678
02:58:21,450 --> 02:58:24,600
I think if you started training
MMA when you were like,

6679
02:58:25,620 --> 02:58:25,951
you know,

6680
02:58:25,951 --> 02:58:30,720
12 years old and now you're 20 you know,

6681
02:58:31,350 --> 02:58:32,880
guess there's that root canal.

6682
02:58:33,040 --> 02:58:33,990
Fucking Aaron Peko.

6683
02:58:34,500 --> 02:58:34,951
Oh yeah.

6684
02:58:34,951 --> 02:58:36,750
There's a perfect example
that kids have heard.

6685
02:58:36,760 --> 02:58:37,560
For example,

6686
02:58:37,560 --> 02:58:40,200
I haven't worked with him yet cause I've
been in training camp and watching him

6687
02:58:40,201 --> 02:58:40,950
move around.

6688
02:58:40,950 --> 02:58:42,570
He's fucking 20 I think.

6689
02:58:42,680 --> 02:58:43,390
Yeah.

6690
02:58:43,390 --> 02:58:43,600
Know,

6691
02:58:43,600 --> 02:58:44,433
he's 20 yet.

6692
02:58:44,490 --> 02:58:45,650
Freak wrestler.

6693
02:58:45,690 --> 02:58:46,380
Yeah.

6694
02:58:46,380 --> 02:58:47,550
Olympic level wrestler.

6695
02:58:47,910 --> 02:58:49,770
A fucking freak striker.

6696
02:58:49,970 --> 02:58:50,220
Good,

6697
02:58:50,220 --> 02:58:51,670
good boxing and was like,

6698
02:58:51,750 --> 02:58:53,400
that's the fucking few causes kicks.

6699
02:58:53,820 --> 02:58:54,780
I haven't seen much of it,

6700
02:58:55,230 --> 02:58:55,561
but you know,

6701
02:58:55,561 --> 02:58:55,861
he just,

6702
02:58:55,861 --> 02:58:55,950
I,

6703
02:58:55,950 --> 02:58:57,690
we just see each other
going out of the gym.

6704
02:58:57,870 --> 02:58:58,830
Does he have submissions?

6705
02:58:59,340 --> 02:59:00,173
I Dunno.

6706
02:59:00,650 --> 02:59:01,050
I,

6707
02:59:01,050 --> 02:59:01,341
I,

6708
02:59:01,341 --> 02:59:02,174
I've worked with him yet.

6709
02:59:02,310 --> 02:59:03,480
He's also one of,

6710
02:59:03,481 --> 02:59:04,170
um,

6711
02:59:04,170 --> 02:59:04,801
uh,

6712
02:59:04,801 --> 02:59:06,840
one of our nick curse on his disciples.

6713
02:59:06,900 --> 02:59:07,321
Exactly.

6714
02:59:07,321 --> 02:59:07,640
So He's,

6715
02:59:07,640 --> 02:59:08,130
he's in free.

6716
02:59:08,130 --> 02:59:10,620
He could shape like freaky shape.

6717
02:59:10,650 --> 02:59:10,981
You know,

6718
02:59:10,981 --> 02:59:12,820
Nick Curse on the guy who trains Dosantos.

6719
02:59:12,990 --> 02:59:13,621
He's got that,

6720
02:59:13,621 --> 02:59:14,390
um,

6721
02:59:14,390 --> 02:59:14,690
he's,

6722
02:59:14,690 --> 02:59:15,840
he's comes from the Marinovich.

6723
02:59:15,841 --> 02:59:18,120
Does that school have a
strength and conditioning?

6724
02:59:18,690 --> 02:59:21,330
All ply owes explosive from the feet up,

6725
02:59:21,360 --> 02:59:21,571
you know,

6726
02:59:21,571 --> 02:59:24,150
all like jumping over
hurdles and shit like that.

6727
02:59:25,700 --> 02:59:30,230
I don't really pay attention to like
fancy strength and conditioning.

6728
02:59:30,260 --> 02:59:31,940
I respect the hell out of it,

6729
02:59:31,941 --> 02:59:32,840
but I,

6730
02:59:33,440 --> 02:59:34,161
I don't really,

6731
02:59:34,161 --> 02:59:34,850
uh,

6732
02:59:34,850 --> 02:59:35,571
what kind of shooting do you,

6733
02:59:35,571 --> 02:59:36,470
do you still lift weights,

6734
02:59:36,471 --> 02:59:37,100
right?

6735
02:59:37,100 --> 02:59:37,341
No,

6736
02:59:37,341 --> 02:59:38,540
I'm just doing yoga right now,

6737
02:59:38,541 --> 02:59:38,930
man.

6738
02:59:38,930 --> 02:59:40,160
Just try no weights at all.

6739
02:59:40,220 --> 02:59:40,701
Nothing,

6740
02:59:40,701 --> 02:59:41,150
man.

6741
02:59:41,150 --> 02:59:41,541
I love you.

6742
02:59:41,541 --> 02:59:42,374
I've got an I had a,

6743
02:59:42,770 --> 02:59:45,020
well it's only because of your back.

6744
02:59:45,320 --> 02:59:45,950
Yeah.

6745
02:59:45,950 --> 02:59:46,251
You know,

6746
02:59:46,251 --> 02:59:50,630
I had back surgery eight months
ago and it's still tender,

6747
02:59:50,690 --> 02:59:51,200
you know,

6748
02:59:51,200 --> 02:59:51,921
it's still,

6749
02:59:51,921 --> 02:59:53,210
it's not healed all the way.

6750
02:59:53,211 --> 02:59:55,040
And I came back and I did Jujitsu.

6751
02:59:55,280 --> 02:59:56,540
I came back a little too early.

6752
02:59:57,110 --> 02:59:57,261
Uh,

6753
02:59:57,261 --> 03:00:00,620
went hard for like a week and then a man,

6754
03:00:00,621 --> 03:00:01,490
I was in the shower to go,

6755
03:00:01,491 --> 03:00:04,820
my back is sore is how I know
what the hell am I doing.

6756
03:00:04,821 --> 03:00:09,170
I just had back surgery so I just how
many months was that before you started

6757
03:00:09,171 --> 03:00:10,700
going and started rolling hard again?

6758
03:00:10,700 --> 03:00:12,020
Like at five months.

6759
03:00:12,200 --> 03:00:13,550
What did the doctor say about that?

6760
03:00:13,970 --> 03:00:14,803
I didn't tell him

6761
03:00:16,370 --> 03:00:18,050
but of course know but,

6762
03:00:18,620 --> 03:00:23,620
but the good news is I don't think I did
any permanent damage cause I haven't,

6763
03:00:25,230 --> 03:00:27,200
haven't lifted weights and I haven't done,

6764
03:00:27,470 --> 03:00:29,590
I haven't sparked you
just I do teach Jujitsu.

6765
03:00:29,600 --> 03:00:34,600
I can teach quite easily
up 90% of the positions.

6766
03:00:35,470 --> 03:00:36,020
Um,

6767
03:00:36,020 --> 03:00:37,040
but it's the pressure.

6768
03:00:37,041 --> 03:00:41,510
Any time someone puts pressure on me and
I got to start twisting 100% to get out

6769
03:00:41,511 --> 03:00:43,820
of something or if I have to to it just,

6770
03:00:44,510 --> 03:00:45,910
it just too soon to just,

6771
03:00:45,950 --> 03:00:46,761
I came back too soon.

6772
03:00:46,761 --> 03:00:48,830
So I decided that to,

6773
03:00:48,890 --> 03:00:49,161
you know,

6774
03:00:49,161 --> 03:00:50,540
I've been wanting to do yoga.

6775
03:00:50,541 --> 03:00:51,980
I know how important yoga is.

6776
03:00:51,981 --> 03:00:53,840
I've been for the last 20 years.

6777
03:00:53,841 --> 03:00:55,010
I'm like I got a deal,

6778
03:00:55,040 --> 03:00:55,873
I got to do yoga.

6779
03:00:55,970 --> 03:01:00,280
You want to be that 75 80 year old guy
that could walk on his eventually I've

6780
03:01:00,281 --> 03:01:02,110
always known it but I
just been procrastinating.

6781
03:01:02,110 --> 03:01:03,280
I've just been so busy.

6782
03:01:03,430 --> 03:01:04,690
Everyone's doing yoga,

6783
03:01:04,691 --> 03:01:05,800
Danny's doing yoga,

6784
03:01:05,801 --> 03:01:06,730
Joe's doing yoga.

6785
03:01:06,731 --> 03:01:07,740
Everyone's like fuck youngest,

6786
03:01:07,741 --> 03:01:08,574
his shit.

6787
03:01:08,830 --> 03:01:09,760
And they get obsessed with it.

6788
03:01:09,761 --> 03:01:12,110
And I know I had to do it but um,

6789
03:01:12,250 --> 03:01:13,780
this forced me into it finally.

6790
03:01:13,960 --> 03:01:16,690
So it was a blessing in disguise
that I came back to where like,

6791
03:01:16,691 --> 03:01:20,500
cause now I'm forced into yoga and um,

6792
03:01:22,330 --> 03:01:24,040
I'm just going to give yoga a chance.

6793
03:01:24,070 --> 03:01:27,130
It's tough cause I do the
hottest class and it's hard man.

6794
03:01:27,131 --> 03:01:28,600
I'm like a total wipe out man.

6795
03:01:28,601 --> 03:01:29,680
I'm just like falling apart.

6796
03:01:29,681 --> 03:01:32,320
And there was so hot and
so it's the hardest one,

6797
03:01:32,321 --> 03:01:35,230
but it's that the best time
I love 10 30 in the morning.

6798
03:01:35,231 --> 03:01:36,700
I wake up 10 15.

6799
03:01:36,880 --> 03:01:38,890
I just get in my car and I
just jammed down the street.

6800
03:01:38,891 --> 03:01:40,730
I get in the right when I literally,

6801
03:01:40,731 --> 03:01:42,700
I get out of bed and go to yoga.

6802
03:01:42,700 --> 03:01:43,630
It's perfect timing.

6803
03:01:43,900 --> 03:01:44,980
It's perfect for my life,

6804
03:01:44,981 --> 03:01:47,080
but it just so happens
it's the hottest one,

6805
03:01:47,320 --> 03:01:48,250
the hardest one.

6806
03:01:48,640 --> 03:01:48,941
But,

6807
03:01:48,941 --> 03:01:49,181
um,

6808
03:01:49,181 --> 03:01:49,481
and I,

6809
03:01:49,481 --> 03:01:52,000
and I conk out halfway through
30 minutes that I'm dead.

6810
03:01:52,001 --> 03:01:52,511
I'm just lying.

6811
03:01:52,511 --> 03:01:53,890
They're just completely drenched in sweat,

6812
03:01:53,891 --> 03:01:54,724
just dead.

6813
03:01:54,730 --> 03:01:55,330
And um,

6814
03:01:55,330 --> 03:01:57,670
but I've only done it for like a month.

6815
03:01:57,671 --> 03:01:58,270
So,

6816
03:01:58,270 --> 03:01:58,571
you know,

6817
03:01:58,571 --> 03:02:00,430
I'm proud that I could go 30 minutes,

6818
03:02:00,431 --> 03:02:00,970
you know what I mean?

6819
03:02:00,970 --> 03:02:01,151
I don't,

6820
03:02:01,151 --> 03:02:02,110
I'm not hard on myself.

6821
03:02:02,111 --> 03:02:02,321
I'm like,

6822
03:02:02,321 --> 03:02:03,010
shit,

6823
03:02:03,010 --> 03:02:06,820
it's hard to breathe in this motherfucker
and to hold those poses in pictures.

6824
03:02:06,910 --> 03:02:08,560
Yoga looks so easy.

6825
03:02:08,561 --> 03:02:10,570
It's like they're doing this big deal,

6826
03:02:10,571 --> 03:02:14,410
but to hold your hands up like
90% of the time for an hour,

6827
03:02:14,620 --> 03:02:15,650
you're always holding your head,

6828
03:02:15,880 --> 03:02:16,241
man,

6829
03:02:16,241 --> 03:02:17,590
that kills your shoulders and you're like,

6830
03:02:17,740 --> 03:02:18,460
I can't even,

6831
03:02:18,460 --> 03:02:20,320
I can't even hold my hands off anymore.

6832
03:02:20,560 --> 03:02:21,660
It's so hard to explain.

6833
03:02:21,710 --> 03:02:22,500
We go with it.

6834
03:02:22,500 --> 03:02:22,651
Well,

6835
03:02:22,651 --> 03:02:24,660
there's certain poses
that you do like this one,

6836
03:02:24,661 --> 03:02:25,381
like the beginning,

6837
03:02:25,381 --> 03:02:28,860
one of the beginning poses where you have
your hands together like this and you

6838
03:02:28,920 --> 03:02:30,450
keep your palms touch.

6839
03:02:30,570 --> 03:02:32,210
You have to keep your palms touching it,

6840
03:02:32,211 --> 03:02:33,120
pressing against.

6841
03:02:33,270 --> 03:02:36,090
You could have facet and
have your hands separate,

6842
03:02:36,240 --> 03:02:37,110
your elbows bent,

6843
03:02:37,350 --> 03:02:41,460
but when you're fully extended and
you're keeping your palms touching,

6844
03:02:41,490 --> 03:02:42,720
it's very difficult.

6845
03:02:42,780 --> 03:02:45,930
It's very difficult to maintain struggle.

6846
03:02:46,470 --> 03:02:46,981
It's hard,

6847
03:02:46,981 --> 03:02:47,340
man.

6848
03:02:47,340 --> 03:02:48,173
That's hard.

6849
03:02:48,500 --> 03:02:52,880
I'm that beginner guy that's just running
out of every class I have to run out

6850
03:02:52,881 --> 03:02:57,270
and take a break at the 30 35% they
don't let you leave at my place.

6851
03:02:57,720 --> 03:02:58,800
She goes out and says,

6852
03:02:58,801 --> 03:03:01,590
does anybody need to leave a?

6853
03:03:01,770 --> 03:03:05,700
You have to clear that with me and
please let's not walk in and out.

6854
03:03:06,000 --> 03:03:06,660
Just try.

6855
03:03:06,660 --> 03:03:08,580
Just if just lay there,

6856
03:03:08,581 --> 03:03:09,391
don't do nothing,

6857
03:03:09,391 --> 03:03:10,224
don't lead.

6858
03:03:10,440 --> 03:03:11,011
I don't care.

6859
03:03:11,011 --> 03:03:11,844
I leave.

6860
03:03:14,190 --> 03:03:16,980
I've only left the class
because I had to throw up.

6861
03:03:17,070 --> 03:03:18,930
I thought it was going to
throw a highly in the room.

6862
03:03:19,440 --> 03:03:20,140
I came in,

6863
03:03:20,140 --> 03:03:21,960
I was a little bit sick and,

6864
03:03:21,961 --> 03:03:22,170
uh,

6865
03:03:22,170 --> 03:03:25,350
I pushed a little too hard and
then somewhere around an hour in,

6866
03:03:25,351 --> 03:03:25,770
I was like,

6867
03:03:25,770 --> 03:03:27,210
I'm gonna fucking throw up.

6868
03:03:27,660 --> 03:03:28,400
I,

6869
03:03:28,400 --> 03:03:29,233
that's me every day.

6870
03:03:29,280 --> 03:03:31,860
So I had to stop and
lay down and I was like,

6871
03:03:31,861 --> 03:03:33,990
maybe I can calm myself
down and get back to it.

6872
03:03:34,020 --> 03:03:35,700
And then when I get back up I was,

6873
03:03:35,701 --> 03:03:36,390
it was worse.

6874
03:03:36,390 --> 03:03:36,751
And I was like,

6875
03:03:36,751 --> 03:03:37,680
I've got to get outside.

6876
03:03:38,310 --> 03:03:39,660
I didn't know that was the toughest.

6877
03:03:39,661 --> 03:03:42,480
I thought that was a normal yoga
class and I was a super was.

6878
03:03:42,630 --> 03:03:44,460
So I just went and it
was the perfect timing.

6879
03:03:44,640 --> 03:03:45,001
I'm like,

6880
03:03:45,001 --> 03:03:45,331
dude,

6881
03:03:45,331 --> 03:03:45,661
this is like,

6882
03:03:45,661 --> 03:03:46,890
I thought it was a normal class.

6883
03:03:46,891 --> 03:03:47,611
They turn up the heat,

6884
03:03:47,611 --> 03:03:49,350
you hear about hot yoga and um,

6885
03:03:50,270 --> 03:03:50,670
I can,

6886
03:03:50,670 --> 03:03:51,870
I can't even breathe.

6887
03:03:52,110 --> 03:03:52,470
And when they,

6888
03:03:52,470 --> 03:03:56,820
when she opens up the door at the 30
minute mark to let some fresh air in,

6889
03:03:57,170 --> 03:03:58,130
that's like some

6890
03:03:58,130 --> 03:04:00,980
kind of wind of God and eternal life,

6891
03:04:01,160 --> 03:04:02,250
like just flushes.

6892
03:04:02,480 --> 03:04:03,710
You feel that when and you're like,

6893
03:04:03,920 --> 03:04:04,940
oh,

6894
03:04:05,150 --> 03:04:06,730
it's like you're drinking what?

6895
03:04:06,740 --> 03:04:10,280
You know you're dying of thirst in the
desert and you've got a giant bottle of

6896
03:04:10,281 --> 03:04:11,114
cold water.

6897
03:04:11,300 --> 03:04:13,540
That's what it feels like that when rue,

6898
03:04:13,580 --> 03:04:14,413
I need that win.

6899
03:04:14,690 --> 03:04:15,860
And I didn't realize,

6900
03:04:15,861 --> 03:04:17,210
I thought that was a normal class.

6901
03:04:17,630 --> 03:04:18,470
And I went up to the,

6902
03:04:18,710 --> 03:04:20,000
to the front desk and I said,

6903
03:04:20,290 --> 03:04:20,660
um,

6904
03:04:20,660 --> 03:04:22,060
are all classes this hot?

6905
03:04:22,070 --> 03:04:22,320
She goes,

6906
03:04:22,320 --> 03:04:22,821
no,

6907
03:04:22,821 --> 03:04:23,800
this is the hottest one.

6908
03:04:23,820 --> 03:04:25,760
There's classes without any heat at all.

6909
03:04:25,761 --> 03:04:28,070
There's different levels and
you're at the hardest one.

6910
03:04:28,071 --> 03:04:28,311
I'm like,

6911
03:04:28,311 --> 03:04:29,144
no shit,

6912
03:04:29,390 --> 03:04:30,810
no wonder I fall apart in that.

6913
03:04:30,920 --> 03:04:33,950
But the last day I went Friday,

6914
03:04:34,190 --> 03:04:35,780
I made it through the whole class,

6915
03:04:37,430 --> 03:04:38,120
but I had,

6916
03:04:38,120 --> 03:04:40,310
I set up my towel right by the door smart.

6917
03:04:40,370 --> 03:04:41,390
So when she opens it up,

6918
03:04:41,391 --> 03:04:42,350
I get that rush.

6919
03:04:42,440 --> 03:04:43,161
I don't have to leave.

6920
03:04:43,161 --> 03:04:44,210
David can right there.

6921
03:04:44,480 --> 03:04:46,550
My problem was going to
the other side of the room.

6922
03:04:46,970 --> 03:04:48,140
I was too deep.

6923
03:04:48,470 --> 03:04:49,370
I was too deep.

6924
03:04:49,510 --> 03:04:54,440
So the is just line up right next
to that door mat right there.

6925
03:04:54,441 --> 03:04:55,274
Boom.

6926
03:04:55,580 --> 03:04:57,230
I'm there five minutes early and shit.

6927
03:04:58,000 --> 03:04:58,750
You know,

6928
03:04:58,750 --> 03:04:59,571
and when I first went,

6929
03:04:59,571 --> 03:05:00,400
I first went in,

6930
03:05:00,400 --> 03:05:02,450
I felt I didn't want to
be that total wipe out.

6931
03:05:02,451 --> 03:05:03,410
So everyone's stretching out.

6932
03:05:03,411 --> 03:05:05,900
Everyone's wrong every once in like
a different poems and stretching.

6933
03:05:06,110 --> 03:05:09,320
So all I can do is I can get
into full lotus on like in Lotus.

6934
03:05:09,321 --> 03:05:09,681
I'm like,

6935
03:05:09,681 --> 03:05:09,981
yeah,

6936
03:05:09,981 --> 03:05:10,814
like now what?

6937
03:05:11,110 --> 03:05:12,140
And I'm just sitting there,

6938
03:05:12,320 --> 03:05:12,980
you know what I mean?

6939
03:05:12,980 --> 03:05:14,390
Cause I can't stretch any other way.

6940
03:05:14,391 --> 03:05:15,620
I have zero flexibility.

6941
03:05:17,180 --> 03:05:18,740
This motherfucker's or guru.

6942
03:05:18,770 --> 03:05:19,460
Yeah,

6943
03:05:19,460 --> 03:05:19,761
yeah.

6944
03:05:19,761 --> 03:05:20,720
That's what I was thinking.

6945
03:05:20,870 --> 03:05:22,340
But they never got to know full load.

6946
03:05:22,341 --> 03:05:22,461
It's,

6947
03:05:22,461 --> 03:05:23,290
you never do that.

6948
03:05:23,290 --> 03:05:24,740
And the routines,

6949
03:05:24,950 --> 03:05:27,100
we were doing all this
shit I can't do like when,

6950
03:05:27,140 --> 03:05:28,430
when we get into Lotus,

6951
03:05:30,880 --> 03:05:32,410
I've never done Lotus and agent.

6952
03:05:32,420 --> 03:05:33,310
That yoga class,

6953
03:05:33,320 --> 03:05:34,310
that pigeon one though.

6954
03:05:34,311 --> 03:05:35,480
You do a single notice.

6955
03:05:36,650 --> 03:05:41,650
That's basically you're getting the same
stretch the toe stand when you have it

6956
03:05:42,350 --> 03:05:43,640
up like pigeon one yes.

6957
03:05:43,920 --> 03:05:44,753
Your face down.

6958
03:05:45,260 --> 03:05:45,381
No,

6959
03:05:45,381 --> 03:05:45,500
no,

6960
03:05:45,500 --> 03:05:45,591
no.

6961
03:05:45,591 --> 03:05:46,251
I'm talking about that,

6962
03:05:46,251 --> 03:05:46,860
that one too,

6963
03:05:46,860 --> 03:05:48,080
that was like tree,

6964
03:05:48,081 --> 03:05:49,300
some tree.

6965
03:05:49,460 --> 03:05:51,170
I'm still confused with the terminology.

6966
03:05:51,171 --> 03:05:51,471
I'm like,

6967
03:05:51,471 --> 03:05:52,130
Damn.

6968
03:05:52,130 --> 03:05:53,800
I'm like one of those dudes
that comes at 10th Plan.

6969
03:05:53,801 --> 03:05:54,320
I was like,

6970
03:05:54,320 --> 03:05:55,580
crack had what?

6971
03:05:56,650 --> 03:06:00,080
Like I've been doing it for two years
and I barely pay attention to what the

6972
03:06:00,081 --> 03:06:00,914
names of things are.

6973
03:06:01,940 --> 03:06:02,773
Slowly.

6974
03:06:02,910 --> 03:06:03,743
Um,

6975
03:06:04,020 --> 03:06:04,490
uh,

6976
03:06:04,490 --> 03:06:08,090
you know what inspired me is Joey Diaz
doing Jujitsu and he's always telling me

6977
03:06:08,091 --> 03:06:09,140
the stories of those first,

6978
03:06:09,170 --> 03:06:11,870
the first day that he w he walked away,

6979
03:06:11,871 --> 03:06:12,810
he showed up and then like,

6980
03:06:13,070 --> 03:06:14,720
I forget how the story goes exactly.

6981
03:06:15,020 --> 03:06:17,540
But he had a real
horrible time in Jujitsu,

6982
03:06:17,541 --> 03:06:18,470
but he kept going.

6983
03:06:18,471 --> 03:06:20,030
He couldn't even shrimp across the room.

6984
03:06:20,240 --> 03:06:21,500
He said he couldn't even shrimp.

6985
03:06:21,680 --> 03:06:22,700
He would just be dead.

6986
03:06:22,701 --> 03:06:23,481
He couldn't breathe.

6987
03:06:23,481 --> 03:06:24,314
He had leave.

6988
03:06:24,350 --> 03:06:27,320
You had to go outside and get some oxygen.

6989
03:06:27,830 --> 03:06:29,120
And I thought about that.

6990
03:06:29,270 --> 03:06:29,590
I might,

6991
03:06:29,590 --> 03:06:32,540
Joey stuck it out and I have no choice.

6992
03:06:32,720 --> 03:06:33,261
I have no choice.

6993
03:06:33,261 --> 03:06:35,030
I know I cannot quit yoga.

6994
03:06:35,031 --> 03:06:36,320
So from this point on,

6995
03:06:36,980 --> 03:06:37,251
man,

6996
03:06:37,251 --> 03:06:37,970
I want to flake,

6997
03:06:37,970 --> 03:06:38,900
but I know I can't.

6998
03:06:39,280 --> 03:06:40,640
It's going to help you or do you just,

6999
03:06:40,641 --> 03:06:41,400
yeah,

7000
03:06:41,400 --> 03:06:42,080
for sure.

7001
03:06:42,080 --> 03:06:45,860
And I'm going to give it some time and
we'll see how I feel in six months on my

7002
03:06:45,861 --> 03:06:46,694
back fields.

7003
03:06:47,390 --> 03:06:50,630
It's feeling pretty good now,

7004
03:06:50,631 --> 03:06:52,760
but it's still tender and in some places,

7005
03:06:52,761 --> 03:06:54,350
but I haven't done any Jiu Jitsu,

7006
03:06:54,351 --> 03:06:56,040
so I don't know if be
doing Jujitsu right now.

7007
03:06:56,310 --> 03:06:57,720
Maybe it'd be sore as hell again.

7008
03:06:57,721 --> 03:06:59,430
So it's really hard to tell.

7009
03:06:59,710 --> 03:07:00,360
And um,

7010
03:07:00,360 --> 03:07:00,991
I don't know man.

7011
03:07:00,991 --> 03:07:04,620
I'm just going to give you good a sh a
chance for awhile before I start rolling

7012
03:07:04,621 --> 03:07:04,891
again,

7013
03:07:04,891 --> 03:07:09,891
just to see if maybe yoga will work
as therapy is therapy to fix my head.

7014
03:07:13,370 --> 03:07:14,510
Hip hit swept down here.

7015
03:07:14,520 --> 03:07:16,500
All those great stories about DDP Yoga,

7016
03:07:16,980 --> 03:07:17,730
you know what I mean?

7017
03:07:17,730 --> 03:07:19,330
He's gotten mad testimonies.

7018
03:07:19,350 --> 03:07:21,640
Well guys were in wheelchairs and they
couldn't walk and they thought it was

7019
03:07:21,700 --> 03:07:22,560
Devon pages.

7020
03:07:22,561 --> 03:07:25,200
Yoga is very legit now and he just,

7021
03:07:25,201 --> 03:07:27,810
he just set us up with a whole
little lifetime thing about it.

7022
03:07:27,811 --> 03:07:28,410
I was talking to him,

7023
03:07:28,410 --> 03:07:29,980
I'm really excited to try it out.

7024
03:07:30,390 --> 03:07:30,921
You know what?

7025
03:07:30,921 --> 03:07:31,754
So I'm thinking it's,

7026
03:07:31,800 --> 03:07:32,940
it's his style of yoga,

7027
03:07:32,941 --> 03:07:33,810
but it's still yoga.

7028
03:07:34,260 --> 03:07:35,011
It's still younger.

7029
03:07:35,011 --> 03:07:35,401
What he's doing,

7030
03:07:35,401 --> 03:07:35,851
it's his style.

7031
03:07:35,851 --> 03:07:36,750
Everyone's got their style.

7032
03:07:37,080 --> 03:07:38,370
So I'm thinking,

7033
03:07:38,371 --> 03:07:38,910
um,

7034
03:07:38,910 --> 03:07:39,330
man,

7035
03:07:39,330 --> 03:07:40,690
I under I,

7036
03:07:41,070 --> 03:07:43,320
it's just hard for me to breathe
in there and eventually I'll,

7037
03:07:43,321 --> 03:07:43,591
I'll,

7038
03:07:43,591 --> 03:07:44,640
I'm going to be really into it.

7039
03:07:44,641 --> 03:07:46,740
You got to do before you go,

7040
03:07:46,741 --> 03:07:47,200
there you go.

7041
03:07:47,200 --> 03:07:47,760
I don't drink that.

7042
03:07:47,760 --> 03:07:50,790
Drink a lot of water within
an hour or so before you go,

7043
03:07:50,791 --> 03:07:51,241
that's hard.

7044
03:07:51,241 --> 03:07:52,440
Cause I woke up and just go.

7045
03:07:52,500 --> 03:07:53,333
I understand.

7046
03:07:53,360 --> 03:07:55,350
But that's part of why
you're having a hard time.

7047
03:07:55,351 --> 03:07:56,640
It's a very grueling,

7048
03:07:56,641 --> 03:07:58,060
rigorous physical workout.

7049
03:07:58,350 --> 03:08:01,590
You want to have some food
in you hearing them squats,

7050
03:08:01,620 --> 03:08:01,801
right?

7051
03:08:01,801 --> 03:08:03,990
But you're not on any kind of
key to genic diet or anything,

7052
03:08:03,991 --> 03:08:04,320
right?

7053
03:08:04,320 --> 03:08:04,800
No,

7054
03:08:04,800 --> 03:08:05,041
no.

7055
03:08:05,041 --> 03:08:07,350
So that means your body is
burning off blue glucose.

7056
03:08:07,530 --> 03:08:09,240
So you're burning off carbs.

7057
03:08:09,270 --> 03:08:10,200
So if that's the case,

7058
03:08:10,500 --> 03:08:12,090
you need eat something
before you go there.

7059
03:08:12,280 --> 03:08:14,730
Like you're not going to have any
fucking energy just like you wouldn't do

7060
03:08:14,731 --> 03:08:15,690
Jujitsu that way.

7061
03:08:15,690 --> 03:08:17,160
You shouldn't do yoga that way either.

7062
03:08:17,640 --> 03:08:19,140
I know you've done Jujitsu hungry before.

7063
03:08:19,141 --> 03:08:19,974
It's terrible.

7064
03:08:20,100 --> 03:08:23,370
So worst feeling in the world when you're
hungry and you go to Jujitsu and you

7065
03:08:23,380 --> 03:08:26,180
your your fucking gassed out
because you're feeling weak.

7066
03:08:26,340 --> 03:08:27,690
But if you didn't even have a Clif bar,

7067
03:08:28,140 --> 03:08:30,900
you had nothing like you've ever
lift weights when you're hungry,

7068
03:08:31,230 --> 03:08:31,881
it's terrible,

7069
03:08:31,881 --> 03:08:32,340
right?

7070
03:08:32,340 --> 03:08:33,360
You feel so weak.

7071
03:08:33,361 --> 03:08:34,180
You know what,

7072
03:08:34,180 --> 03:08:34,590
that's,

7073
03:08:34,590 --> 03:08:35,251
that's my problem.

7074
03:08:35,251 --> 03:08:36,390
I got to eat gummy.

7075
03:08:36,930 --> 03:08:37,920
Oh Man,

7076
03:08:37,921 --> 03:08:39,520
I gotta wake up 15 minutes earlier.

7077
03:08:39,580 --> 03:08:40,470
No more than that.

7078
03:08:40,471 --> 03:08:40,921
More than that.

7079
03:08:40,921 --> 03:08:41,970
I wake up an hour earlier.

7080
03:08:43,170 --> 03:08:44,370
You want it to digest,

7081
03:08:44,460 --> 03:08:45,293
wake up,

7082
03:08:45,540 --> 03:08:46,081
eat your food.

7083
03:08:46,081 --> 03:08:47,380
There's some beating
exercises and then go.

7084
03:08:48,580 --> 03:08:49,020
Yeah,

7085
03:08:49,020 --> 03:08:50,220
but if you were going to go running,

7086
03:08:50,250 --> 03:08:52,050
what kind of shit would you
do before you went running?

7087
03:08:52,410 --> 03:08:53,243
What would you eat?

7088
03:08:54,000 --> 03:08:54,690
Who Runs?

7089
03:08:54,690 --> 03:08:55,523
If you were gonna die,

7090
03:08:56,540 --> 03:08:58,060
ask asking rates.

7091
03:08:58,170 --> 03:08:59,003
Sprints in the pool.

7092
03:08:59,370 --> 03:09:00,840
They'll sprints in the
pool that you were doing.

7093
03:09:00,990 --> 03:09:02,760
If you had to do that and you
knew you're going to do that,

7094
03:09:02,761 --> 03:09:05,280
and how long would you
want to eat beforehand?

7095
03:09:07,980 --> 03:09:08,850
Probably like two hours,

7096
03:09:08,851 --> 03:09:09,450
right?

7097
03:09:09,450 --> 03:09:11,460
Maybe even more or something like that.

7098
03:09:11,490 --> 03:09:16,200
I would like maybe even three hours
before I empty stomach Clif bar.

7099
03:09:16,201 --> 03:09:17,820
Get right to it and you're fine.

7100
03:09:17,850 --> 03:09:18,600
Clif bar,

7101
03:09:18,600 --> 03:09:20,790
it's like perfect Ms. Sugar gazing.

7102
03:09:20,800 --> 03:09:22,080
You don't get right into it.

7103
03:09:22,220 --> 03:09:23,610
We're going to have to ease into shit.

7104
03:09:23,710 --> 03:09:24,930
It's really light.

7105
03:09:25,290 --> 03:09:29,660
Just enough to get you going to
power through the round before.

7106
03:09:29,670 --> 03:09:31,530
Before I do seminars,

7107
03:09:31,531 --> 03:09:33,480
that's my ritual is a Clif bar.

7108
03:09:33,570 --> 03:09:36,720
I don't want to go to breakfast and
have French toast or some bullshit like

7109
03:09:36,721 --> 03:09:37,260
that.

7110
03:09:37,260 --> 03:09:39,120
I just want a Clif bar and let's go.

7111
03:09:39,180 --> 03:09:39,331
Well,

7112
03:09:39,331 --> 03:09:39,751
that's good.

7113
03:09:39,751 --> 03:09:41,130
Foreign rock star fucking love French,

7114
03:09:41,131 --> 03:09:41,560
so that's,

7115
03:09:41,560 --> 03:09:42,061
that's good.

7116
03:09:42,061 --> 03:09:45,040
That's a long as you have something where
you need something similar to that to

7117
03:09:45,070 --> 03:09:45,770
a young discipline.

7118
03:09:45,770 --> 03:09:49,680
Maybe a little more because I think
yoga is more akin to those pools.

7119
03:09:49,681 --> 03:09:52,980
Sprints than it is the
teaching a seminar yogas.

7120
03:09:53,020 --> 03:09:54,010
It's fucking really

7121
03:09:54,010 --> 03:09:55,500
hard because everything you're doing,

7122
03:09:55,540 --> 03:09:57,610
you're doing 100% if
you're doing it right,

7123
03:09:57,850 --> 03:09:58,690
you're balancing,

7124
03:09:58,691 --> 03:10:00,000
you're holding these positions,

7125
03:10:00,540 --> 03:10:04,690
you're flexing your stomach and you're
tightening up your back and you're

7126
03:10:04,960 --> 03:10:09,960
extending your legs and you're minding
your body that these are all the

7127
03:10:10,181 --> 03:10:12,040
movements I still need.

7128
03:10:12,041 --> 03:10:12,671
I still want,

7129
03:10:12,671 --> 03:10:13,780
cause you're not there for very long.

7130
03:10:13,781 --> 03:10:17,470
It's like long routines and you go
throw up your some positions just once,

7131
03:10:17,471 --> 03:10:18,760
maybe twice you go back to it.

7132
03:10:18,910 --> 03:10:19,331
That's it.

7133
03:10:19,331 --> 03:10:22,540
There's so many other ways you
can twist and bend your body.

7134
03:10:22,541 --> 03:10:24,500
It's basically just reminding everybody,

7135
03:10:24,580 --> 03:10:26,710
don't shut this down.

7136
03:10:26,711 --> 03:10:28,210
Don't shut that down.

7137
03:10:28,510 --> 03:10:30,040
Don't shut this down.

7138
03:10:30,041 --> 03:10:31,050
I need this working.

7139
03:10:31,350 --> 03:10:33,400
It just every day it's reminding of body,

7140
03:10:33,940 --> 03:10:36,760
don't shut this shit down because
if you don't remind your body,

7141
03:10:36,910 --> 03:10:39,910
you will get shut down and you'll be
that 75 year old guy that can barely walk

7142
03:10:39,911 --> 03:10:40,720
to the TV,

7143
03:10:40,720 --> 03:10:41,553
turn it on and go,

7144
03:10:41,590 --> 03:10:42,170
go to the bathroom,

7145
03:10:42,170 --> 03:10:42,870
take a Piss,

7146
03:10:42,870 --> 03:10:46,690
walked to his car to go to the market
can barely move and you're 75 you're just

7147
03:10:46,691 --> 03:10:47,524
like ready to go.

7148
03:10:48,190 --> 03:10:49,810
You taught your body to be like that.

7149
03:10:49,990 --> 03:10:51,520
There's enough old dude's,

7150
03:10:51,521 --> 03:10:52,630
it looks Helio Gracie,

7151
03:10:52,631 --> 03:10:57,520
he was in his nineties and he was still
out and about doing armbars on people.

7152
03:10:57,730 --> 03:10:58,563
You know what I mean?

7153
03:10:59,470 --> 03:11:02,680
Yoga is the best way cause
it goes through everything.

7154
03:11:02,681 --> 03:11:03,220
It's like,

7155
03:11:03,220 --> 03:11:04,330
it's like all organized.

7156
03:11:04,331 --> 03:11:04,511
Okay.

7157
03:11:04,511 --> 03:11:05,080
We got,

7158
03:11:05,080 --> 03:11:08,530
we mapped out all the twists and the
bends and all the holds and all the ways

7159
03:11:08,531 --> 03:11:12,430
you could use your own body wave
instead of external weights.

7160
03:11:12,431 --> 03:11:15,640
You're using your body and all these
different ways and hitting all your

7161
03:11:15,641 --> 03:11:16,120
muscles.

7162
03:11:16,120 --> 03:11:17,410
At first I thought that was no,

7163
03:11:18,010 --> 03:11:18,940
I thought the whole was,

7164
03:11:18,941 --> 03:11:22,720
that was no clinching and in Yoga,

7165
03:11:22,721 --> 03:11:23,111
but there is,

7166
03:11:23,111 --> 03:11:24,570
you clinch your legs all the Goddamn time.

7167
03:11:24,580 --> 03:11:25,540
There's all these positions.

7168
03:11:25,541 --> 03:11:27,370
We had clenching and you're squeezing too.

7169
03:11:27,760 --> 03:11:30,120
So really there's Yogas,

7170
03:11:30,160 --> 03:11:30,790
everything.

7171
03:11:30,790 --> 03:11:31,623
That's all you,

7172
03:11:31,630 --> 03:11:32,380
it seems.

7173
03:11:32,380 --> 03:11:34,870
DDP was always tell him
he gave me a yoga lesson.

7174
03:11:35,050 --> 03:11:37,120
We went to 25 and finished
and he showed me what his DB,

7175
03:11:37,180 --> 03:11:38,620
DDP Yoga was all about.

7176
03:11:38,950 --> 03:11:41,470
And at that point I wasn't
ready to stop lifting weights.

7177
03:11:41,770 --> 03:11:42,041
I was like,

7178
03:11:42,041 --> 03:11:44,200
I just want to like if I
stopped lifting weights,

7179
03:11:44,500 --> 03:11:44,771
you know,

7180
03:11:44,771 --> 03:11:46,050
I'm going to lose all my strength and I,

7181
03:11:46,060 --> 03:11:46,360
you know,

7182
03:11:46,360 --> 03:11:47,020
get,

7183
03:11:47,020 --> 03:11:47,510
you know,

7184
03:11:47,510 --> 03:11:47,920
uh,

7185
03:11:47,920 --> 03:11:49,000
paranoid about that shit.

7186
03:11:49,210 --> 03:11:50,590
But now I have no choice.

7187
03:11:50,710 --> 03:11:54,190
I gotta stop the wades
focus on yoga and um,

7188
03:11:55,120 --> 03:11:55,600
you know,

7189
03:11:55,600 --> 03:11:58,030
once I master all the Shit
and get my balance together,

7190
03:11:58,060 --> 03:12:02,770
I see how you can turn up the
strength and really gets him,

7191
03:12:03,460 --> 03:12:03,850
you know,

7192
03:12:03,850 --> 03:12:07,660
you might be able to get all the strength
you need from yoga if done properly.

7193
03:12:07,690 --> 03:12:08,980
I am hoping,

7194
03:12:09,100 --> 03:12:13,060
I'm hoping it's not going to have the
same amount of ability to pull things,

7195
03:12:13,540 --> 03:12:14,620
but here's the thing,

7196
03:12:14,621 --> 03:12:16,480
you don't have to stop lifting weights.

7197
03:12:16,870 --> 03:12:19,510
Like there's no reason to stop
just because you're doing that.

7198
03:12:19,840 --> 03:12:22,720
I think it might have totally
different way of lifting weights now,

7199
03:12:23,140 --> 03:12:23,561
you know,

7200
03:12:23,561 --> 03:12:26,680
and the first person I had heard
about this from was actually Felicia.

7201
03:12:26,710 --> 03:12:26,931
Oh,

7202
03:12:26,931 --> 03:12:27,641
you know Felicia?

7203
03:12:27,641 --> 03:12:27,791
Oh.

7204
03:12:27,791 --> 03:12:29,440
Teaches people that he'd do kettlebells.

7205
03:12:30,160 --> 03:12:30,610
Kettlebells.

7206
03:12:30,610 --> 03:12:31,090
Yeah.

7207
03:12:31,090 --> 03:12:35,200
She was telling me a long time ago about
not going to failure a long time ago.

7208
03:12:35,201 --> 03:12:35,591
She was saying,

7209
03:12:35,591 --> 03:12:38,890
she's like always leave something in
a tank and they just do it more often.

7210
03:12:39,140 --> 03:12:39,551
She was like,

7211
03:12:39,551 --> 03:12:40,960
don't do it to failure.

7212
03:12:41,350 --> 03:12:41,801
And I was like,

7213
03:12:41,801 --> 03:12:42,101
okay.

7214
03:12:42,101 --> 03:12:42,940
I mean that's interesting.

7215
03:12:42,941 --> 03:12:43,870
But I didn't look into it.

7216
03:12:43,871 --> 03:12:46,870
And then I heard Pavel Tatsu
Alene talk about it years later.

7217
03:12:46,871 --> 03:12:48,040
It's good news by the way.

7218
03:12:49,300 --> 03:12:52,070
So what I do now is I
don't weights to the point

7219
03:12:52,070 --> 03:12:53,660
where like I like last set,

7220
03:12:54,830 --> 03:12:55,663
I don't do that.

7221
03:12:56,180 --> 03:12:57,260
I do less sets,

7222
03:12:57,920 --> 03:12:59,000
I do less reps,

7223
03:12:59,420 --> 03:13:00,440
I just do it more often.

7224
03:13:00,710 --> 03:13:02,000
I'll do it like two or three times a week.

7225
03:13:02,001 --> 03:13:04,310
So I'm never super sore
so I'll get out of it.

7226
03:13:04,311 --> 03:13:05,330
I'm never exhausted.

7227
03:13:05,540 --> 03:13:07,880
And the difference between this kind
of strength work and the other kind of

7228
03:13:07,881 --> 03:13:09,680
strength worth cause the
other strength worth,

7229
03:13:09,710 --> 03:13:10,370
I would do it,

7230
03:13:10,370 --> 03:13:13,940
I would blow my shit out and
then I was done for like a day,

7231
03:13:13,941 --> 03:13:15,500
two days and just super sore,

7232
03:13:15,501 --> 03:13:16,310
couldn't do anything.

7233
03:13:16,310 --> 03:13:17,480
Now I'm never like that.

7234
03:13:17,720 --> 03:13:18,301
So the,

7235
03:13:18,301 --> 03:13:20,270
the idea that we always had of like,

7236
03:13:20,271 --> 03:13:21,180
you gotta go to fail,

7237
03:13:21,181 --> 03:13:23,470
you've got to break everything
down to build it back up to a week.

7238
03:13:23,540 --> 03:13:25,370
The body part policy says bullshit.

7239
03:13:25,730 --> 03:13:26,061
He says,

7240
03:13:26,061 --> 03:13:26,181
no,

7241
03:13:26,181 --> 03:13:27,680
you just do it less often.

7242
03:13:27,710 --> 03:13:31,940
Take bigger breaks in between the sets
and do it more often during the week.

7243
03:13:32,000 --> 03:13:32,930
That's a fantastic,

7244
03:13:33,110 --> 03:13:33,621
yeah,

7245
03:13:33,621 --> 03:13:38,621
I think these motherfuckers out there in
a lazy cause it's still takes time and

7246
03:13:38,841 --> 03:13:40,110
you still do it with a lot of effort,

7247
03:13:40,150 --> 03:13:42,950
but he's like anything more
than five reps is bodybuilding.

7248
03:13:42,980 --> 03:13:43,281
He's like,

7249
03:13:43,281 --> 03:13:44,780
you don't want to do more than five reps.

7250
03:13:44,781 --> 03:13:45,650
You want to do short,

7251
03:13:45,830 --> 03:13:46,640
shorter,

7252
03:13:46,640 --> 03:13:47,300
shorter sets.

7253
03:13:47,300 --> 03:13:48,660
Where'd you find this out at?

7254
03:13:48,800 --> 03:13:50,170
Popple Tatsu lean.

7255
03:13:50,210 --> 03:13:51,043
He's a,

7256
03:13:51,530 --> 03:13:51,831
well,

7257
03:13:51,831 --> 03:13:52,740
he's on everything.

7258
03:13:52,750 --> 03:13:53,750
It's on youtube as well,

7259
03:13:53,751 --> 03:13:54,830
but he's also in the library.

7260
03:13:54,831 --> 03:13:55,790
You'll be confused.

7261
03:13:56,120 --> 03:13:58,320
You want to know which way
to turn as his fake news.

7262
03:13:58,550 --> 03:13:59,383
Real News.

7263
03:14:00,350 --> 03:14:02,300
Super well-respected Kettlebell guy.

7264
03:14:02,301 --> 03:14:04,750
He's actually is the
godfather of kettlebells.

7265
03:14:04,850 --> 03:14:06,710
He's the guy who brought
kettlebells over to America.

7266
03:14:07,430 --> 03:14:08,360
He's got those.

7267
03:14:08,361 --> 03:14:08,840
Um,

7268
03:14:08,840 --> 03:14:11,060
so if you had a pull up bar
at your house and if you just,

7269
03:14:11,061 --> 03:14:11,481
did you,

7270
03:14:11,481 --> 03:14:14,360
when you did your Max
every like once a day,

7271
03:14:14,570 --> 03:14:15,110
every day.

7272
03:14:15,110 --> 03:14:15,651
Once a day,

7273
03:14:15,651 --> 03:14:16,311
did he or Max,

7274
03:14:16,311 --> 03:14:18,530
he think he's talking
about that kind of stuff.

7275
03:14:19,070 --> 03:14:22,190
If you had a pull up bar at
your house and every day,

7276
03:14:22,191 --> 03:14:26,180
every day you did like a 10 in
the morning and then 10 at night,

7277
03:14:26,330 --> 03:14:27,860
which is not to failure.

7278
03:14:28,130 --> 03:14:30,860
Like if you do it like say if you can do,

7279
03:14:31,700 --> 03:14:32,120
you know,

7280
03:14:32,120 --> 03:14:36,140
if you can do seven chin ups with a 50
pound kettlebell hanging from your waist

7281
03:14:36,141 --> 03:14:37,130
instead of doing seven,

7282
03:14:37,131 --> 03:14:37,611
that's too much.

7283
03:14:37,611 --> 03:14:38,444
One to three.

7284
03:14:38,900 --> 03:14:41,930
If you can do 15 chin-ups straight,

7285
03:14:42,560 --> 03:14:47,040
do seven just do five
to seven do it often.

7286
03:14:47,570 --> 03:14:49,010
That's a different way of getting strong.

7287
03:14:49,040 --> 03:14:49,700
Exactly.

7288
03:14:49,700 --> 03:14:50,570
And you'll still get strong.

7289
03:14:50,571 --> 03:14:51,390
Exactly.

7290
03:14:51,390 --> 03:14:52,223
Exactly.

7291
03:14:52,290 --> 03:14:53,750
It actually gets stronger quicker.

7292
03:14:53,900 --> 03:14:54,650
My wife's strong.

7293
03:14:54,650 --> 03:14:57,010
Appropriate because you
don't get beat up a pill up,

7294
03:14:57,011 --> 03:14:57,380
pull up,

7295
03:14:57,380 --> 03:14:58,520
pull up bars are amazing.

7296
03:14:58,880 --> 03:15:00,110
They're great for your shoulders,

7297
03:15:00,111 --> 03:15:01,640
hang from him all the time.

7298
03:15:01,760 --> 03:15:03,590
If you get those goddamn gravity boots,

7299
03:15:03,680 --> 03:15:05,000
you split those into those.

7300
03:15:05,090 --> 03:15:06,560
You can hang from your ankles.

7301
03:15:06,590 --> 03:15:08,300
You can sort of loosen
your backup from there.

7302
03:15:08,301 --> 03:15:10,520
You can do those setups from your ankles.

7303
03:15:10,600 --> 03:15:10,930
Hang.

7304
03:15:10,930 --> 03:15:15,230
Are you doing a little l with your legs
when you're hanging on my bar have to,

7305
03:15:15,260 --> 03:15:17,070
I have to lift my legs up and my bar.

7306
03:15:17,071 --> 03:15:17,841
I have to buzz that.

7307
03:15:17,841 --> 03:15:18,320
Okay.

7308
03:15:18,320 --> 03:15:19,190
I like system.

7309
03:15:19,310 --> 03:15:19,761
Yes,

7310
03:15:19,761 --> 03:15:22,460
but it doesn't give you the same
benefits or your lower back cause you're

7311
03:15:22,461 --> 03:15:23,294
tightened up.

7312
03:15:23,450 --> 03:15:24,970
I like to do it in a hang.

7313
03:15:25,010 --> 03:15:25,821
I'm unfortunately,

7314
03:15:25,821 --> 03:15:27,530
my bar at home is not tall enough.

7315
03:15:27,531 --> 03:15:28,520
I should get one that's taller.

7316
03:15:28,880 --> 03:15:32,150
I like to hang where my feet aren't
touching the ground so I could relax my

7317
03:15:32,151 --> 03:15:32,601
back.

7318
03:15:32,601 --> 03:15:36,110
Totally let my gyms go
to gyms on the road.

7319
03:15:36,140 --> 03:15:37,670
A lot of gyms on the
road we'll have like a,

7320
03:15:38,030 --> 03:15:38,601
you know a bar.

7321
03:15:38,601 --> 03:15:39,070
That's what,

7322
03:15:39,070 --> 03:15:41,780
whatever the height is that where
your arms are fully extended?

7323
03:15:41,781 --> 03:15:43,180
Probably more for other people.

7324
03:15:43,181 --> 03:15:43,430
I'm like,

7325
03:15:43,430 --> 03:15:44,031
I'm only five,

7326
03:15:44,031 --> 03:15:47,540
eight but I can hold onto that bar and
if my toes aren't touching the ground

7327
03:15:47,541 --> 03:15:49,190
then I can relax my back.

7328
03:15:49,490 --> 03:15:50,310
And when I'm relaxed

7329
03:15:50,310 --> 03:15:50,821
my back,

7330
03:15:50,821 --> 03:15:54,210
I could feel it like extending
and just sort of loosening up.

7331
03:15:54,420 --> 03:15:56,400
But between that and yoga exercises,

7332
03:15:56,401 --> 03:16:00,120
like the one where your reach behind your
calves and you grab your heel and your

7333
03:16:00,140 --> 03:16:00,630
stent,

7334
03:16:00,630 --> 03:16:02,700
that is pop in my back like crazy.

7335
03:16:02,940 --> 03:16:04,200
Like I feel my back.

7336
03:16:04,201 --> 03:16:05,130
Every time I do it,

7337
03:16:05,131 --> 03:16:06,330
I feel a little pup pup.

7338
03:16:06,540 --> 03:16:11,070
I could feel my back stretching and the
amount of tension that I carry in my

7339
03:16:11,071 --> 03:16:11,940
back and like,

7340
03:16:11,941 --> 03:16:12,870
like during the day,

7341
03:16:12,871 --> 03:16:14,150
like being sitting in a chair,

7342
03:16:14,160 --> 03:16:15,000
sitting in my car,

7343
03:16:15,270 --> 03:16:16,590
it's almost nonexistent now.

7344
03:16:16,710 --> 03:16:18,030
It's just from doing yoga a lot.

7345
03:16:19,580 --> 03:16:21,480
I think it strengthens
the whole spinal column.

7346
03:16:21,481 --> 03:16:22,410
That's huge for it.

7347
03:16:22,440 --> 03:16:22,651
I've,

7348
03:16:22,651 --> 03:16:23,040
I've,

7349
03:16:23,040 --> 03:16:24,660
I mean I've gained so much from Yoga.

7350
03:16:24,661 --> 03:16:25,110
I love it.

7351
03:16:25,110 --> 03:16:28,320
I've been doing it for
probably four years now.

7352
03:16:28,390 --> 03:16:29,223
Wow.

7353
03:16:31,500 --> 03:16:32,333
Um,

7354
03:16:33,270 --> 03:16:33,930
not enough.

7355
03:16:33,930 --> 03:16:35,940
Do you feel like it
helps your kicks a week?

7356
03:16:36,370 --> 03:16:36,750
Um,

7357
03:16:36,750 --> 03:16:37,231
maybe.

7358
03:16:37,231 --> 03:16:39,090
I mean there was times where I
was doing it three days a week,

7359
03:16:39,091 --> 03:16:40,710
but then there were times I
didn't do it for a few months,

7360
03:16:40,711 --> 03:16:41,260
so it's just,

7361
03:16:41,260 --> 03:16:46,020
just always I have a yearly subscription
or a yearly pass to the place at my

7362
03:16:46,021 --> 03:16:47,340
house three times a week.

7363
03:16:47,341 --> 03:16:50,400
If I'm in town on the weekend two
times a week when I go out of town,

7364
03:16:50,520 --> 03:16:51,420
just for right now,

7365
03:16:51,570 --> 03:16:52,020
I just,

7366
03:16:52,020 --> 03:16:55,890
I'm just trying to hang through the
whole class and trying to get my belts

7367
03:16:55,891 --> 03:16:56,220
together.

7368
03:16:56,220 --> 03:16:57,001
Like all those poses,

7369
03:16:57,001 --> 03:16:58,500
like the standing splits and all that.

7370
03:16:58,930 --> 03:16:59,763
Yeah,

7371
03:17:01,250 --> 03:17:02,970
I've been able to do that.

7372
03:17:02,971 --> 03:17:03,510
Right.

7373
03:17:03,510 --> 03:17:05,100
There's so much shit like that.

7374
03:17:05,101 --> 03:17:05,791
Just the side,

7375
03:17:05,791 --> 03:17:06,061
Ben,

7376
03:17:06,061 --> 03:17:09,210
when you do the side bend
and I go down right here,

7377
03:17:09,480 --> 03:17:10,410
this is what I do,

7378
03:17:10,880 --> 03:17:12,900
and then there's that back surgery.

7379
03:17:13,140 --> 03:17:15,000
I mean that's like where it really bends.

7380
03:17:15,030 --> 03:17:16,980
You're talking about the lowest link.

7381
03:17:20,300 --> 03:17:21,133
They're like,

7382
03:17:21,570 --> 03:17:23,020
there's this one lady in my class.

7383
03:17:23,150 --> 03:17:23,370
Yeah,

7384
03:17:23,370 --> 03:17:25,770
there's One lady in my class at the waist.

7385
03:17:25,771 --> 03:17:27,480
She can just literally take a right turn.

7386
03:17:27,600 --> 03:17:29,010
It's the freakiest thing ever.

7387
03:17:29,011 --> 03:17:32,200
Like what is going on with
your rib cage is doing that.

7388
03:17:33,200 --> 03:17:34,033
Is it that um,

7389
03:17:34,530 --> 03:17:39,530
her bones are lined up in a special
way or that that's a possibility?

7390
03:17:40,260 --> 03:17:41,160
Anybody could do that.

7391
03:17:41,161 --> 03:17:42,660
If they stretched properly,

7392
03:17:42,690 --> 03:17:44,100
anybody would be able to do that sheet.

7393
03:17:44,101 --> 03:17:45,510
This one day in my class,

7394
03:17:45,511 --> 03:17:46,440
she goes so far.

7395
03:17:46,441 --> 03:17:46,771
Right.

7396
03:17:46,771 --> 03:17:49,650
I just can't imagine that my body
has ever been able to do that.

7397
03:17:50,170 --> 03:17:50,910
Not as much,

7398
03:17:50,910 --> 03:17:55,650
but is there a way to take a regular
guy like me or you have no side Ben,

7399
03:17:56,010 --> 03:18:00,060
and it's just like tendons and
muscles that have to be stretched,

7400
03:18:00,061 --> 03:18:00,390
right?

7401
03:18:00,390 --> 03:18:00,610
Yeah.

7402
03:18:00,610 --> 03:18:02,190
It was actually have a pretty good side,

7403
03:18:02,191 --> 03:18:04,200
but my side bends actually pretty good.

7404
03:18:04,230 --> 03:18:04,711
But what?

7405
03:18:04,711 --> 03:18:06,300
I'm fast can you get really good?

7406
03:18:06,360 --> 03:18:08,250
Can anybody get really good at that?

7407
03:18:08,370 --> 03:18:10,770
I think anybody think you
can get real good at it,

7408
03:18:10,771 --> 03:18:12,600
but I'm never going to
get as good as that lady.

7409
03:18:13,070 --> 03:18:13,530
Yeah.

7410
03:18:13,530 --> 03:18:14,520
Her body just goes,

7411
03:18:14,521 --> 03:18:14,820
oh,

7412
03:18:14,820 --> 03:18:15,690
this lady in my class,

7413
03:18:15,691 --> 03:18:17,130
her body just goes over the,

7414
03:18:17,190 --> 03:18:18,570
we could get good at basketball,

7415
03:18:18,571 --> 03:18:20,010
but doesn't mean you're
going to be Michael Jackson.

7416
03:18:22,590 --> 03:18:23,423
What am I saying,

7417
03:18:23,500 --> 03:18:24,333
Jackson?

7418
03:18:24,390 --> 03:18:26,130
I did whatever.

7419
03:18:26,160 --> 03:18:27,300
I do that all the time.

7420
03:18:27,740 --> 03:18:30,540
Michael Jordan is the Michael
Jackson of basketball.

7421
03:18:30,570 --> 03:18:31,403
Good point.

7422
03:18:31,980 --> 03:18:33,150
Except the kid fucking

7423
03:18:35,460 --> 03:18:36,370
back beans.

7424
03:18:36,390 --> 03:18:37,250
What about backbends?

7425
03:18:37,260 --> 03:18:38,250
How far can you go back?

7426
03:18:38,670 --> 03:18:43,380
Can you that that much man and is it a
little bit more than it was and getting a

7427
03:18:43,381 --> 03:18:44,141
little bit better?

7428
03:18:44,141 --> 03:18:45,360
I know I'm hanging in there,

7429
03:18:45,361 --> 03:18:45,780
man.

7430
03:18:45,780 --> 03:18:46,320
I'm like,

7431
03:18:46,320 --> 03:18:47,980
I'm hanging in there like a trooper.

7432
03:18:47,980 --> 03:18:48,813
Eventually.

7433
03:18:49,210 --> 03:18:50,080
Eventually I'm going to,

7434
03:18:50,310 --> 03:18:51,180
if I stick it out,

7435
03:18:51,181 --> 03:18:51,970
I'm going to get good at it.

7436
03:18:51,970 --> 03:18:52,761
I think you know,

7437
03:18:52,761 --> 03:18:53,620
it's like Jujitsu.

7438
03:18:54,060 --> 03:18:55,240
I'm done trying to,

7439
03:18:55,330 --> 03:18:57,640
it would be nice to be good at it cause I,

7440
03:18:57,641 --> 03:18:59,470
right now it's really embarrassing.

7441
03:18:59,500 --> 03:19:01,060
Everyone looks over at
me and they're like,

7442
03:19:01,090 --> 03:19:01,691
oh my God,

7443
03:19:01,691 --> 03:19:02,524
look at this guy.

7444
03:19:02,560 --> 03:19:07,560
I feel like I can definitely show
you Abbott and Costello episode.

7445
03:19:08,860 --> 03:19:10,060
You have them doing yoga.

7446
03:19:10,061 --> 03:19:10,810
You know what I mean?

7447
03:19:10,810 --> 03:19:11,650
I'm terrible.

7448
03:19:12,130 --> 03:19:12,701
You'll get better,

7449
03:19:12,701 --> 03:19:13,534
dude.

7450
03:19:13,930 --> 03:19:15,340
The worst balance,

7451
03:19:16,740 --> 03:19:18,330
but you don't want to call moves,

7452
03:19:18,331 --> 03:19:19,164
right?

7453
03:19:19,510 --> 03:19:21,010
Just think of how I'm
talking about standing,

7454
03:19:21,011 --> 03:19:21,910
standing matter.

7455
03:19:21,911 --> 03:19:22,920
Think about how good you got.

7456
03:19:22,970 --> 03:19:23,651
Jujitsu moves,

7457
03:19:23,651 --> 03:19:24,160
right?

7458
03:19:24,160 --> 03:19:26,710
That's you're going to be able to
get that good with yoga as well.

7459
03:19:26,740 --> 03:19:26,991
It's just,

7460
03:19:26,991 --> 03:19:27,360
Oh,

7461
03:19:27,360 --> 03:19:29,050
you just gotta be willing
to put in the time.

7462
03:19:29,680 --> 03:19:30,341
The way I describe it,

7463
03:19:30,341 --> 03:19:31,720
it's like you're building a mountain,

7464
03:19:32,050 --> 03:19:37,050
one layer of paint at a time and
so for me it's like two years in,

7465
03:19:37,840 --> 03:19:38,860
I still suck.

7466
03:19:39,070 --> 03:19:39,940
I'm not good at it.

7467
03:19:39,970 --> 03:19:41,080
I'm looking forward to it.

7468
03:19:41,081 --> 03:19:42,520
Definitely better than I was.

7469
03:19:42,580 --> 03:19:42,880
Yeah,

7470
03:19:42,880 --> 03:19:44,380
I'm way better at Yoga than I was.

7471
03:19:44,650 --> 03:19:46,360
You probably can do a lot of the yoga.

7472
03:19:46,361 --> 03:19:48,730
Should you have a crazy
balance from taekwondo?

7473
03:19:49,000 --> 03:19:50,440
Like Geo Martinez?

7474
03:19:50,640 --> 03:19:50,831
Oh,

7475
03:19:50,831 --> 03:19:51,670
Richie Martinez.

7476
03:19:51,760 --> 03:19:54,010
They could jump into yoga right
now and just cruise right.

7477
03:19:54,860 --> 03:19:55,541
That'd be easy.

7478
03:19:55,541 --> 03:19:57,250
They would want to do some crazy yoga,

7479
03:19:57,251 --> 03:19:57,791
some power,

7480
03:19:57,791 --> 03:19:58,421
Yoga and shit.

7481
03:19:58,421 --> 03:20:00,010
We have to do those
side things from there.

7482
03:20:00,020 --> 03:20:03,390
Like legs are extended versions.

7483
03:20:03,750 --> 03:20:04,930
There are options.

7484
03:20:04,931 --> 03:20:08,050
Like there's certain spots where you
could sit in frog or you could stand frog

7485
03:20:08,051 --> 03:20:11,080
or you could work on your inversion right
here and some people are doing crazy

7486
03:20:11,081 --> 03:20:11,830
handstands.

7487
03:20:11,830 --> 03:20:13,360
I'm in frog easily.

7488
03:20:13,420 --> 03:20:14,021
Boom.

7489
03:20:14,021 --> 03:20:14,530
Mike,

7490
03:20:14,530 --> 03:20:15,363
this is my,

7491
03:20:15,520 --> 03:20:16,810
my world frog.

7492
03:20:16,811 --> 03:20:17,644
Are you kidding?

7493
03:20:17,770 --> 03:20:18,521
That's the best one.

7494
03:20:18,521 --> 03:20:21,160
I got the best yoga pose
I crushed with frog.

7495
03:20:21,670 --> 03:20:22,590
That's bone.

7496
03:20:23,000 --> 03:20:23,430
This is my,

7497
03:20:23,430 --> 03:20:25,170
I do this every day and Jujitsu.

7498
03:20:25,870 --> 03:20:28,780
Well most of the classes
that we do the uh,

7499
03:20:28,810 --> 03:20:33,810
what fails me first is my feet and
that's way less than it was before.

7500
03:20:33,911 --> 03:20:38,530
And what's interesting to me is I always
thought that like from kickboxing or

7501
03:20:38,570 --> 03:20:38,831
you know,

7502
03:20:38,831 --> 03:20:41,410
just even lifting weights and my
feet are probably pretty strong.

7503
03:20:41,860 --> 03:20:43,150
My feet are so weak.

7504
03:20:43,360 --> 03:20:45,100
It's kinda crazy how weak they are.

7505
03:20:45,310 --> 03:20:46,660
And with Yoga,

7506
03:20:46,690 --> 03:20:50,350
like the thing that would hurt
the most is the arches of my feet.

7507
03:20:50,530 --> 03:20:51,820
My feet would start hurting.

7508
03:20:52,120 --> 03:20:53,320
That doesn't happen anymore.

7509
03:20:53,410 --> 03:20:55,390
And what's interesting is
that was always happening.

7510
03:20:55,391 --> 03:20:57,310
Also what I would go skiing too,

7511
03:20:57,311 --> 03:20:58,090
when I'll go schemes,

7512
03:20:58,090 --> 03:20:58,481
terrible.

7513
03:20:58,481 --> 03:20:58,911
First of all,

7514
03:20:58,911 --> 03:21:01,570
get these fat fucking caveman feet.

7515
03:21:01,600 --> 03:21:02,440
They're too wide.

7516
03:21:02,470 --> 03:21:03,610
So they don't fit into most,

7517
03:21:03,640 --> 03:21:06,280
most of the shoes have to buy my
own shoes because they don't fit in.

7518
03:21:06,281 --> 03:21:08,380
The ones that are like if I buy a size 11,

7519
03:21:08,381 --> 03:21:09,370
they don't fit my size.

7520
03:21:09,371 --> 03:21:11,730
11 I have to get like
size 11 has to be wider.

7521
03:21:11,731 --> 03:21:14,380
It is to and my foot would always hurt.

7522
03:21:14,381 --> 03:21:14,710
Man.

7523
03:21:14,710 --> 03:21:15,071
What are you doing?

7524
03:21:15,071 --> 03:21:17,410
Jim went louder or something.

7525
03:21:17,560 --> 03:21:18,340
Something happened here.

7526
03:21:18,340 --> 03:21:19,380
Did it disconnect with them?

7527
03:21:20,710 --> 03:21:21,543
Um,

7528
03:21:22,210 --> 03:21:25,270
but my foot would always hurt
the most when I was small.

7529
03:21:25,530 --> 03:21:26,331
That's what his shoulder,

7530
03:21:26,331 --> 03:21:27,190
it's not real.

7531
03:21:27,520 --> 03:21:28,353
It's not a belt.

7532
03:21:28,660 --> 03:21:29,261
It's not,

7533
03:21:29,261 --> 03:21:29,441
no,

7534
03:21:29,441 --> 03:21:30,400
he doesn't have a belt.

7535
03:21:30,490 --> 03:21:30,750
Oh,

7536
03:21:30,750 --> 03:21:31,583
okay.

7537
03:21:31,820 --> 03:21:32,653
Thanks.

7538
03:21:33,370 --> 03:21:34,900
That's some shit you buy at the store.

7539
03:21:37,450 --> 03:21:38,250
I drank.

7540
03:21:38,250 --> 03:21:38,900
Oh my God.

7541
03:21:38,900 --> 03:21:40,020
That's hilarious bitch.

7542
03:21:40,160 --> 03:21:40,450
Oh,

7543
03:21:40,450 --> 03:21:41,830
did you fuck up and drink one of those?

7544
03:21:41,920 --> 03:21:42,580
Yes.

7545
03:21:42,580 --> 03:21:42,971
Oh No.

7546
03:21:42,971 --> 03:21:46,100
I didn't touch my cannot
getting me son of a bitch.

7547
03:21:46,580 --> 03:21:47,930
I said no at first.

7548
03:21:48,110 --> 03:21:49,580
So he convinced me.

7549
03:21:49,610 --> 03:21:50,151
But anyway,

7550
03:21:50,151 --> 03:21:51,950
from doing yoga for two years now,

7551
03:21:51,951 --> 03:21:53,180
my feet don't hurt anymore.

7552
03:21:53,240 --> 03:21:54,290
They don't hurt in yoga.

7553
03:21:54,350 --> 03:21:58,280
My balance fails me before my feet
family or my hamstrings get sore.

7554
03:21:58,370 --> 03:21:59,400
Oh my caps.

7555
03:21:59,410 --> 03:22:00,021
Oh my God.

7556
03:22:00,021 --> 03:22:01,930
I have the weakest calves on the jobs.

7557
03:22:02,190 --> 03:22:03,170
I have no cabs,

7558
03:22:03,171 --> 03:22:03,710
ma'am.

7559
03:22:03,710 --> 03:22:04,850
That doesn't hurt me at all.

7560
03:22:04,851 --> 03:22:05,684
It's interesting.

7561
03:22:06,500 --> 03:22:07,220
My meats,

7562
03:22:07,220 --> 03:22:08,120
my hamstrings,

7563
03:22:08,121 --> 03:22:09,500
it's always my hamstrings hurting.

7564
03:22:09,501 --> 03:22:10,131
Like when that one,

7565
03:22:10,131 --> 03:22:12,950
these standing on one leg and you're
pulling your foot back and extending your

7566
03:22:13,000 --> 03:22:13,833
lag,

7567
03:22:13,880 --> 03:22:17,330
it's always Mike supporting
hamstrings like about enough for you.

7568
03:22:17,331 --> 03:22:18,100
You fuck.

7569
03:22:18,100 --> 03:22:18,900
And like my feet.

7570
03:22:18,900 --> 03:22:19,130
Dot.

7571
03:22:19,130 --> 03:22:19,311
It's,

7572
03:22:19,311 --> 03:22:21,080
I mean arches of my feet just kill me.

7573
03:22:21,630 --> 03:22:21,860
I'm like,

7574
03:22:21,860 --> 03:22:22,071
okay,

7575
03:22:22,071 --> 03:22:24,500
I just have to like not
have to sit on my ass.

7576
03:22:24,560 --> 03:22:26,480
That's the one thing that
doesn't happen anymore.

7577
03:22:26,481 --> 03:22:27,141
It's shocking.

7578
03:22:27,141 --> 03:22:32,030
It took literally look over a year and
then after a year and my foot just from

7579
03:22:32,031 --> 03:22:32,511
steady,

7580
03:22:32,511 --> 03:22:33,291
going steady,

7581
03:22:33,291 --> 03:22:33,861
going steady,

7582
03:22:33,861 --> 03:22:34,640
sucking,

7583
03:22:34,640 --> 03:22:38,120
my foot's eventually got strong enough
where it doesn't happen at all anymore.

7584
03:22:38,210 --> 03:22:39,470
So now when I go skiing,

7585
03:22:39,560 --> 03:22:40,760
my feet don't bother me at all.

7586
03:22:40,761 --> 03:22:45,761
I got 30% better as a skier because of
yoga hundred percent cause my big problem

7587
03:22:46,041 --> 03:22:46,670
was my feet.

7588
03:22:46,670 --> 03:22:47,300
Yeah.

7589
03:22:47,300 --> 03:22:48,440
Now I could ski easy.

7590
03:22:48,441 --> 03:22:48,621
I'm like,

7591
03:22:48,621 --> 03:22:49,220
it's not that I was,

7592
03:22:49,220 --> 03:22:50,001
I was always freaked out.

7593
03:22:50,001 --> 03:22:50,181
I'm like,

7594
03:22:50,181 --> 03:22:51,110
why do my feet hurt?

7595
03:22:51,130 --> 03:22:51,963
Like getting good at it.

7596
03:22:52,210 --> 03:22:52,490
Oh yeah.

7597
03:22:52,490 --> 03:22:53,300
I'm pretty good guys.

7598
03:22:53,300 --> 03:22:53,781
Not Good.

7599
03:22:53,781 --> 03:22:54,231
Like real,

7600
03:22:54,231 --> 03:22:55,190
just a snowboarding.

7601
03:22:55,520 --> 03:22:56,660
I'll switch this with the promise.

7602
03:22:56,661 --> 03:22:57,620
Snowboarding is fun.

7603
03:22:57,740 --> 03:22:58,670
I bet it's awesome.

7604
03:22:58,730 --> 03:23:00,440
But if you fall down,

7605
03:23:00,560 --> 03:23:04,390
you kind of tend to fall on your fucking
head because a lot of people get Kol.

7606
03:23:04,400 --> 03:23:05,211
You get good at it.

7607
03:23:05,211 --> 03:23:06,930
I know three people that got chaos.

7608
03:23:07,380 --> 03:23:08,840
Kol My friend,

7609
03:23:08,841 --> 03:23:10,140
Amga,

7610
03:23:10,140 --> 03:23:10,160
Josie,

7611
03:23:10,160 --> 03:23:10,993
jumping,

7612
03:23:11,320 --> 03:23:12,153
jump.

7613
03:23:12,920 --> 03:23:13,753
Did you jump?

7614
03:23:13,850 --> 03:23:14,210
Yeah,

7615
03:23:14,210 --> 03:23:14,930
exactly.

7616
03:23:14,930 --> 03:23:15,763
Don't jump.

7617
03:23:15,770 --> 03:23:17,840
Just be happy for flying
down the mountain.

7618
03:23:18,080 --> 03:23:18,913
You don't have to jump.

7619
03:23:18,920 --> 03:23:19,700
I don't jump.

7620
03:23:19,700 --> 03:23:20,533
Fuck that shit.

7621
03:23:20,540 --> 03:23:21,373
He never fell.

7622
03:23:21,560 --> 03:23:22,281
Oh Shit.

7623
03:23:22,281 --> 03:23:24,950
The first day you got to
sacrifice the first day.

7624
03:23:25,040 --> 03:23:25,581
First Day.

7625
03:23:25,581 --> 03:23:26,414
I tell everybody,

7626
03:23:26,630 --> 03:23:27,620
you're just trying to,

7627
03:23:28,070 --> 03:23:31,520
you're trying to work today
just to enjoy your second to,

7628
03:23:31,521 --> 03:23:32,780
so you live your first day.

7629
03:23:32,870 --> 03:23:33,800
You're not going to have fun.

7630
03:23:33,830 --> 03:23:37,060
Do you think that I would sacrifice
since I've skied for a few years,

7631
03:23:37,070 --> 03:23:38,600
everybody starts skiing.

7632
03:23:38,601 --> 03:23:40,370
I started skiing and then
once you switch and go,

7633
03:23:40,371 --> 03:23:41,150
Oh shit.

7634
03:23:41,150 --> 03:23:43,070
It's like going from uh,

7635
03:23:43,120 --> 03:23:43,520
um,

7636
03:23:43,520 --> 03:23:43,970
like uh,

7637
03:23:43,970 --> 03:23:47,120
Microsoft to apple really
is that much better.

7638
03:23:47,350 --> 03:23:48,183
Ah,

7639
03:23:48,550 --> 03:23:52,790
very few people go from snowboarding to
skin really snowboarding's different and

7640
03:23:52,791 --> 03:23:54,530
feels different skins awesome too.

7641
03:23:54,680 --> 03:23:55,610
You're going down a mountain.

7642
03:23:55,611 --> 03:23:55,941
Either way,

7643
03:23:55,941 --> 03:23:56,720
you look at it,

7644
03:23:56,720 --> 03:23:57,420
you're going down the mountain.

7645
03:23:57,420 --> 03:23:58,370
It's just a different angle.

7646
03:23:58,371 --> 03:23:59,061
And different turns.

7647
03:23:59,061 --> 03:24:00,830
It feels like you're surfing
on the God damn mountain,

7648
03:24:00,831 --> 03:24:02,170
but what bothers me that is he,

7649
03:24:02,171 --> 03:24:03,710
you're stuck on that board.

7650
03:24:03,950 --> 03:24:04,221
Yes.

7651
03:24:04,221 --> 03:24:06,230
Like what I like about
skiing is when you fall,

7652
03:24:06,231 --> 03:24:07,820
you kind of fall like a person.

7653
03:24:08,090 --> 03:24:11,000
Like you know the huskies
pop off and then he can roll.

7654
03:24:11,090 --> 03:24:13,160
Like I never gotten hurt falling
because I know how to fall.

7655
03:24:13,161 --> 03:24:14,330
As soon as I know I'm falling,

7656
03:24:14,450 --> 03:24:18,380
I just go with it and then I'm not trying
to like plant my leg and stop it from

7657
03:24:18,381 --> 03:24:19,214
happening.

7658
03:24:19,270 --> 03:24:20,720
I just roll and go with it.

7659
03:24:20,721 --> 03:24:20,991
That's,

7660
03:24:20,991 --> 03:24:21,471
that's like,

7661
03:24:21,471 --> 03:24:23,690
it's the same thing what you're
saying because I've done both.

7662
03:24:23,840 --> 03:24:24,970
But you're for Sarah attached.

7663
03:24:25,480 --> 03:24:26,313
It's like,

7664
03:24:26,510 --> 03:24:28,280
it's like I understand
where you're coming from.

7665
03:24:28,520 --> 03:24:32,120
It's like a guy that's a done karate
and he's feeling comfortable with it,

7666
03:24:32,121 --> 03:24:35,390
but he doesn't want to do Jujitsu cause
it's just way more dangerous and you're

7667
03:24:35,391 --> 03:24:35,930
like,

7668
03:24:35,930 --> 03:24:37,460
I see why you think that,

7669
03:24:37,461 --> 03:24:39,320
but actually it's not more dangerous.

7670
03:24:39,321 --> 03:24:40,010
You know what I mean?

7671
03:24:40,010 --> 03:24:40,880
It's just like that.

7672
03:24:40,910 --> 03:24:44,200
So you could fall and control
yourself just as you got a snowboard

7673
03:24:44,200 --> 03:24:44,550
boring,

7674
03:24:44,550 --> 03:24:46,240
you'll get hurt just as easy as you would.

7675
03:24:46,360 --> 03:24:47,640
Let me ask him cause the same thing.

7676
03:24:47,641 --> 03:24:48,480
He also does it.

7677
03:24:48,500 --> 03:24:49,560
What do you agree with this?

7678
03:24:49,950 --> 03:24:51,450
I've been snowboarding like my whole life,

7679
03:24:51,470 --> 03:24:52,201
but I started skiing.

7680
03:24:52,201 --> 03:24:55,230
Of course my parents had a
scheme over here like to um,

7681
03:24:55,350 --> 03:24:55,771
but yeah,

7682
03:24:55,771 --> 03:24:57,000
you fuck yourself up to any other one.

7683
03:24:57,540 --> 03:24:59,310
I put myself in the hospital snowboarding.

7684
03:24:59,311 --> 03:25:00,810
My cousin put herself in the hospital,

7685
03:25:00,930 --> 03:25:01,800
ski skiing.

7686
03:25:01,830 --> 03:25:03,970
I just put yourself in the hospital
snowboarding hitting my head.

7687
03:25:04,680 --> 03:25:05,950
The guys that my brother

7688
03:25:08,790 --> 03:25:09,623
Joe,

7689
03:25:09,760 --> 03:25:10,680
my cousin's shattered his,

7690
03:25:10,681 --> 03:25:13,050
he knows people shout at the collar bones,

7691
03:25:13,140 --> 03:25:15,210
they're trying to flip in the air.

7692
03:25:15,940 --> 03:25:18,930
Don't slip exactly the right thing to
do is how do you shatter his wrist,

7693
03:25:19,720 --> 03:25:20,640
shatter his heels.

7694
03:25:20,670 --> 03:25:21,510
Nobody gets hurt.

7695
03:25:21,511 --> 03:25:22,370
Just snowboarding.

7696
03:25:22,371 --> 03:25:23,550
Skiing is jumping a,

7697
03:25:23,551 --> 03:25:26,790
I'm like a road gap
and a road gap or yeah,

7698
03:25:26,791 --> 03:25:28,920
some sort of gap that's a road.

7699
03:25:28,921 --> 03:25:30,120
But then you can jump over it,

7700
03:25:30,121 --> 03:25:30,420
you know.

7701
03:25:30,420 --> 03:25:31,440
Oh he's trying to jump things.

7702
03:25:31,670 --> 03:25:32,503
Yes.

7703
03:25:37,100 --> 03:25:38,150
I'm not dying on the mountain.

7704
03:25:38,180 --> 03:25:39,240
Oh Shit.

7705
03:25:39,270 --> 03:25:42,300
If you already like and scam
barely after all this time.

7706
03:25:43,310 --> 03:25:44,143
Nice key.

7707
03:25:44,760 --> 03:25:45,390
Don't get hurt.

7708
03:25:45,390 --> 03:25:45,991
Don't get hurt.

7709
03:25:45,991 --> 03:25:46,621
Don't get hurt.

7710
03:25:46,621 --> 03:25:47,454
Don't get hurt.

7711
03:25:47,640 --> 03:25:48,473
Didn't get hurt.

7712
03:25:48,510 --> 03:25:49,520
Don't get hurt dog there.

7713
03:25:49,640 --> 03:25:49,891
All right,

7714
03:25:49,891 --> 03:25:50,610
I'm done.

7715
03:25:50,610 --> 03:25:52,710
I ski for like a couple
of hours and I'm good.

7716
03:25:53,250 --> 03:25:53,911
I just go,

7717
03:25:53,911 --> 03:25:54,541
Jesus Christ.

7718
03:25:54,541 --> 03:25:55,770
This isn't that fun.

7719
03:25:56,850 --> 03:25:57,530
Snowboarding.

7720
03:25:57,530 --> 03:25:58,650
That's all you got to snowboard,

7721
03:25:58,651 --> 03:25:59,010
man.

7722
03:25:59,010 --> 03:25:59,540
Maybe I'm just,

7723
03:25:59,540 --> 03:26:02,340
you got family loves to hurt
themselves trying to kill nobody.

7724
03:26:02,400 --> 03:26:04,080
That's not a people man.

7725
03:26:04,390 --> 03:26:05,580
Animals have feelings.

7726
03:26:06,060 --> 03:26:07,860
I don't know if they do cause
you eat 'em all the time.

7727
03:26:08,070 --> 03:26:10,570
I'd never heard it didn't.

7728
03:26:11,630 --> 03:26:16,290
I thought it was just about that
and I was raised eating in the car.

7729
03:26:16,291 --> 03:26:17,910
When when you pull that Burger King,

7730
03:26:18,650 --> 03:26:19,483
did you care about

7731
03:26:22,630 --> 03:26:23,610
that's not real meat.

7732
03:26:24,140 --> 03:26:24,360
Yeah.

7733
03:26:24,360 --> 03:26:25,230
If he didn't eat all day,

7734
03:26:25,231 --> 03:26:26,064
someone's going to die.

7735
03:26:27,440 --> 03:26:28,150
Look at the race.

7736
03:26:28,150 --> 03:26:29,130
Say Sas food.

7737
03:26:29,140 --> 03:26:30,680
Meat isn't real meat judging.

7738
03:26:30,690 --> 03:26:31,970
I'm just asking.

7739
03:26:31,980 --> 03:26:32,890
I'm just trying to,

7740
03:26:33,730 --> 03:26:37,380
they're very concerned
about cruelty to animals.

7741
03:26:37,381 --> 03:26:40,560
That's why they make those
burgers that aren't really meet.

7742
03:26:40,590 --> 03:26:41,190
They're not real.

7743
03:26:41,190 --> 03:26:42,140
Would you guys say that they

7744
03:26:43,830 --> 03:26:48,120
figured out how to make test tube
meat now get it down to $11 a burger.

7745
03:26:48,410 --> 03:26:48,740
Okay.

7746
03:26:48,740 --> 03:26:49,410
Yeah.

7747
03:26:49,410 --> 03:26:49,770
Like they,

7748
03:26:49,770 --> 03:26:53,970
it was like $300,000 a few years
ago and they got it down to 11 one,

7749
03:26:53,980 --> 03:26:56,090
two kind of cancer that's
going to cause all kinds,

7750
03:26:56,230 --> 03:26:57,063
everything.

7751
03:26:57,100 --> 03:26:57,933
Everything

7752
03:26:59,880 --> 03:27:03,690
comes near the first going
to test it on inmates.

7753
03:27:03,691 --> 03:27:05,170
They're going to get inmates fake me.

7754
03:27:05,171 --> 03:27:06,320
So we're going to turn fucking,

7755
03:27:06,321 --> 03:27:07,470
they going to see what's up.

7756
03:27:08,710 --> 03:27:12,120
That's going to be the beginning of
the nightmare of the living dead.

7757
03:27:12,150 --> 03:27:12,983
Exactly.

7758
03:27:13,280 --> 03:27:13,850
Come on me.

7759
03:27:13,850 --> 03:27:16,650
He's going to turn people into
fucking Zombie movie about fake meat.

7760
03:27:17,040 --> 03:27:20,030
It just seems like there is
movies called fake meat and it's,

7761
03:27:20,130 --> 03:27:20,430
I don't know.

7762
03:27:20,430 --> 03:27:20,581
Well,

7763
03:27:20,581 --> 03:27:21,341
here's what's crazy.

7764
03:27:21,341 --> 03:27:22,320
And Bang brothers,

7765
03:27:22,350 --> 03:27:24,480
there's a recent study they did with,

7766
03:27:24,481 --> 03:27:24,721
uh,

7767
03:27:24,721 --> 03:27:25,590
with rats,

7768
03:27:25,620 --> 03:27:30,180
I believe it was where they fed them
meat from older animals and meat from

7769
03:27:30,181 --> 03:27:31,170
younger animals.

7770
03:27:31,440 --> 03:27:35,100
And it turns out that when they
fed them meat from older animals,

7771
03:27:35,130 --> 03:27:40,080
it's sped up their aging process and
compared to the animals that were fed meat

7772
03:27:40,081 --> 03:27:41,040
from younger animals.

7773
03:27:41,050 --> 03:27:43,090
That's why the politicians
want to eat babies.

7774
03:27:43,720 --> 03:27:44,920
That's like with the whole blood thing,

7775
03:27:44,921 --> 03:27:45,191
right?

7776
03:27:45,191 --> 03:27:46,830
They change out your blood for that.

7777
03:27:47,010 --> 03:27:51,130
That's a new thing that they think
possibly while they're doing it,

7778
03:27:51,430 --> 03:27:52,263
they don't know if there's,

7779
03:27:52,270 --> 03:27:54,340
there's no real proof
that it works on people,

7780
03:27:54,341 --> 03:27:59,290
but they have shown that it works on
rats and mice and they think it might be

7781
03:27:59,291 --> 03:28:03,280
more of a function of there's things
in the new blood that aren't in the old

7782
03:28:03,281 --> 03:28:06,190
blood anymore that you need
and as soon as you get them,

7783
03:28:06,191 --> 03:28:06,351
you,

7784
03:28:06,351 --> 03:28:09,820
you just be behave like a
younger person versus the,

7785
03:28:09,821 --> 03:28:10,840
it makes you younger.

7786
03:28:11,110 --> 03:28:15,070
They think that it's just your body at
a certain age just lacks the essential

7787
03:28:15,071 --> 03:28:18,250
properties of the blood
that it has when it's young.

7788
03:28:18,370 --> 03:28:22,540
So when they've shown it and in rats
and in blue it was actually mice.

7789
03:28:22,870 --> 03:28:25,210
When they showed how they
put young blood in them,

7790
03:28:25,211 --> 03:28:28,720
they started behaving like young mice
and also when they put old blood in the

7791
03:28:28,721 --> 03:28:29,201
young mice,

7792
03:28:29,201 --> 03:28:30,860
they started behaving like old mice.

7793
03:28:31,090 --> 03:28:31,511
Man,

7794
03:28:31,511 --> 03:28:31,970
that sound,

7795
03:28:31,970 --> 03:28:32,530
that's,

7796
03:28:32,530 --> 03:28:34,090
that's why they're into babies.

7797
03:28:36,130 --> 03:28:36,963
Baby blood.

7798
03:28:37,780 --> 03:28:38,171
You know what?

7799
03:28:38,171 --> 03:28:40,570
I wonder if they could pull the
blood out and that actually kill him.

7800
03:28:40,571 --> 03:28:42,960
Just like have them around
just for the baby blood,

7801
03:28:43,000 --> 03:28:44,380
didn't they do then blade,

7802
03:28:44,590 --> 03:28:45,070
you know what I mean?

7803
03:28:45,070 --> 03:28:46,240
They just have a bunch of babies.

7804
03:28:46,310 --> 03:28:47,500
Which body goes hanging there?

7805
03:28:47,830 --> 03:28:48,431
Cruelty,

7806
03:28:48,431 --> 03:28:49,780
free baby blood lipid.

7807
03:28:50,500 --> 03:28:53,060
Let the babies play in the
nurseries and baby fine.

7808
03:28:53,160 --> 03:28:53,520
Well,

7809
03:28:53,520 --> 03:28:57,650
they can make this meet and they can make
this fake meat if they can make a fake

7810
03:28:57,700 --> 03:28:58,420
meat.

7811
03:28:58,420 --> 03:28:58,721
What if,

7812
03:28:58,721 --> 03:29:02,720
what if they made like fake babies that
were headless that just gave you blood?

7813
03:29:04,540 --> 03:29:09,540
Then you're going to fucking find some
reports on these fake news sites that the

7814
03:29:11,530 --> 03:29:12,280
dying,

7815
03:29:12,280 --> 03:29:13,600
when the blood is dying,

7816
03:29:13,601 --> 03:29:14,440
when the body is dying,

7817
03:29:14,441 --> 03:29:14,980
it's,

7818
03:29:14,980 --> 03:29:16,990
it needs to be that in
the process of dying

7819
03:29:18,670 --> 03:29:19,503
the blood,

7820
03:29:19,760 --> 03:29:21,010
something happens to the blood.

7821
03:29:21,011 --> 03:29:22,840
That's where the gold is slow.

7822
03:29:22,840 --> 03:29:25,480
It seems to me that there's a bunch of
people that are looking at the human body

7823
03:29:25,481 --> 03:29:27,880
like it's a math problem
or they're just trying to,

7824
03:29:27,881 --> 03:29:28,181
okay,

7825
03:29:28,181 --> 03:29:29,140
let's try that.

7826
03:29:29,260 --> 03:29:29,590
Nope,

7827
03:29:29,590 --> 03:29:30,341
that's not doing it.

7828
03:29:30,341 --> 03:29:30,611
Okay,

7829
03:29:30,611 --> 03:29:31,151
let's try the,

7830
03:29:31,151 --> 03:29:31,871
what's the password?

7831
03:29:31,871 --> 03:29:35,920
Is it that and then one day they're
going to find it and then got a bank.

7832
03:29:35,950 --> 03:29:36,281
Okay,

7833
03:29:36,281 --> 03:29:36,851
we got it.

7834
03:29:36,851 --> 03:29:38,320
You're going to live to a thousand we win.

7835
03:29:38,660 --> 03:29:42,700
This is probably a kid today that is going
to live to a thousand and it might be

7836
03:29:42,701 --> 03:29:44,730
completely dependent
upon when they catch you.

7837
03:29:45,130 --> 03:29:45,310
Yeah.

7838
03:29:45,310 --> 03:29:46,870
Like maybe they catch you,

7839
03:29:46,930 --> 03:29:47,530
you know,

7840
03:29:47,530 --> 03:29:49,000
and they give you the immortal,

7841
03:29:49,480 --> 03:29:54,480
immortal gene they injected in
you before you quite hit puberty.

7842
03:29:54,670 --> 03:29:55,361
Like right.

7843
03:29:55,361 --> 03:29:59,470
They figure like you gotta make a decision
when you're like 11 or 12 do you want

7844
03:29:59,471 --> 03:30:00,041
to live forever?

7845
03:30:00,041 --> 03:30:01,120
Do you want to die like everybody else?

7846
03:30:01,360 --> 03:30:01,721
I don't know,

7847
03:30:01,721 --> 03:30:02,051
dad,

7848
03:30:02,051 --> 03:30:02,590
what do you think?

7849
03:30:02,590 --> 03:30:05,130
Well saw and I'm going to die
and I won't be here for you.

7850
03:30:07,470 --> 03:30:10,390
You got to figure out whether or not
you take it and if you got to give it to

7851
03:30:10,391 --> 03:30:13,450
your kids and then one day you know you're
going to be 70 kids still going to be

7852
03:30:13,451 --> 03:30:17,170
20 he's going to still be 2080
he's still 2090 you're still,

7853
03:30:17,230 --> 03:30:18,340
he's still 20 you're dying.

7854
03:30:18,341 --> 03:30:18,630
You're,

7855
03:30:18,630 --> 03:30:19,990
everything's falling apart and shaking.

7856
03:30:20,200 --> 03:30:22,600
The kids out there playing tag
football didn't give a fuck.

7857
03:30:23,050 --> 03:30:25,240
Surfing slinging dick all over the place.

7858
03:30:25,241 --> 03:30:26,770
He's still 27 years old.

7859
03:30:26,771 --> 03:30:27,790
He's 20 you're like,

7860
03:30:27,791 --> 03:30:28,750
what in the fuck?

7861
03:30:29,020 --> 03:30:29,853
What did I do?

7862
03:30:30,270 --> 03:30:31,390
Like I made an immortal,

7863
03:30:32,040 --> 03:30:33,340
you can still get hit by a car though.

7864
03:30:33,700 --> 03:30:34,533
Damn.

7865
03:30:35,080 --> 03:30:39,650
So you can still dial yourself or you'd
have to die and people would probably

7866
03:30:39,651 --> 03:30:41,450
engage in much more risky activity.

7867
03:30:41,451 --> 03:30:42,860
They would heal like little kids.

7868
03:30:43,280 --> 03:30:43,850
It'd be,

7869
03:30:43,850 --> 03:30:44,361
I mean that's,

7870
03:30:44,361 --> 03:30:45,440
that's going to happen.

7871
03:30:45,441 --> 03:30:45,981
They're gonna figure.

7872
03:30:45,981 --> 03:30:48,230
They've already figured out some
incredible stuff with stem cells.

7873
03:30:48,440 --> 03:30:53,440
They had a guy who was paralyzed and
now he's able to exercise with his upper

7874
03:30:53,691 --> 03:30:54,071
body.

7875
03:30:54,071 --> 03:30:55,340
He's able to move his upper body.

7876
03:30:55,341 --> 03:30:58,610
Like this is a a first
with stem cell therapy.

7877
03:30:58,940 --> 03:30:59,900
We're just finding this out.

7878
03:31:00,350 --> 03:31:01,940
The library and Youtube.

7879
03:31:04,230 --> 03:31:05,063
I found out,

7880
03:31:05,140 --> 03:31:09,020
I knew answer library and Youtube.

7881
03:31:09,021 --> 03:31:10,550
I looked at all sources,

7882
03:31:10,551 --> 03:31:11,384
bro.

7883
03:31:12,080 --> 03:31:12,651
All Bro.

7884
03:31:12,651 --> 03:31:13,484
Sources.

7885
03:31:14,330 --> 03:31:17,300
We mean we're living in weird times
too because I think we're just one

7886
03:31:17,301 --> 03:31:21,290
generation or two away from people being
able to completely change what they

7887
03:31:21,291 --> 03:31:22,124
look like,

7888
03:31:22,160 --> 03:31:23,600
like at a genetic level.

7889
03:31:23,900 --> 03:31:25,010
Like if you seen what like,

7890
03:31:25,040 --> 03:31:26,930
like some kids are doing today,

7891
03:31:27,110 --> 03:31:28,250
like young kids,

7892
03:31:28,280 --> 03:31:32,750
like young reality star kids like the
Kim Kardashians getting extensive plastic

7893
03:31:32,751 --> 03:31:35,790
surgery at 20 just ridiculous report.

7894
03:31:36,210 --> 03:31:37,880
Did they really get but jobs?

7895
03:31:38,060 --> 03:31:38,331
Oh yeah,

7896
03:31:38,331 --> 03:31:40,520
100% a hundred percent
a hundred percent yeah.

7897
03:31:40,620 --> 03:31:41,940
Did you didn't even need it.

7898
03:31:42,160 --> 03:31:42,430
Yeah,

7899
03:31:42,430 --> 03:31:45,050
but you want to keep that business going.

7900
03:31:45,200 --> 03:31:46,310
You got to take it to the next level.

7901
03:31:47,020 --> 03:31:49,490
How the job is that like knowing the fact,

7902
03:31:49,550 --> 03:31:50,960
oh well I'm not a doctor,

7903
03:31:50,961 --> 03:31:52,100
nor am I a detective.

7904
03:31:52,460 --> 03:31:53,360
But I'll say yes

7905
03:31:55,160 --> 03:31:56,690
it or not.

7906
03:31:57,140 --> 03:31:57,771
I am sure.

7907
03:31:57,771 --> 03:31:59,350
I don't know if she did admit it.

7908
03:31:59,540 --> 03:32:01,280
There's a before and after photos.

7909
03:32:01,300 --> 03:32:04,900
She's got a fucking ass.

7910
03:32:05,270 --> 03:32:05,750
Pretty sure it's,

7911
03:32:05,750 --> 03:32:06,800
if she wanted a big ass,

7912
03:32:06,801 --> 03:32:07,880
she fucking got it.

7913
03:32:07,910 --> 03:32:08,251
She got,

7914
03:32:08,251 --> 03:32:09,450
she got her ass one.

7915
03:32:09,740 --> 03:32:10,880
That's the biggest,

7916
03:32:10,881 --> 03:32:13,160
most gigantic ass based on her.

7917
03:32:13,340 --> 03:32:14,380
Her proportions like,

7918
03:32:14,440 --> 03:32:14,850
yeah,

7919
03:32:14,850 --> 03:32:15,620
like all of this.

7920
03:32:15,620 --> 03:32:17,660
She looks like a normal
thing in the hips up.

7921
03:32:18,570 --> 03:32:20,650
She just looks like a little
frequency at the globe.

7922
03:32:20,800 --> 03:32:23,760
Freaking Ooh,

7923
03:32:23,870 --> 03:32:25,010
holy shit dog.

7924
03:32:25,070 --> 03:32:25,881
And in a giant,

7925
03:32:25,881 --> 03:32:29,240
large like Derriere to tremendous,

7926
03:32:29,241 --> 03:32:29,901
if you know what I mean.

7927
03:32:29,901 --> 03:32:30,734
I mean,

7928
03:32:30,820 --> 03:32:34,250
let's stop and think about that
because that didn't exist 20 years ago.

7929
03:32:34,430 --> 03:32:34,881
It doesn't,

7930
03:32:34,881 --> 03:32:36,320
it didn't exist in both ways.

7931
03:32:36,410 --> 03:32:37,880
Natural and unnatural.

7932
03:32:38,090 --> 03:32:38,661
It didn't exist,

7933
03:32:38,661 --> 03:32:42,350
exist natural because there weren't girls
were doing squats like you didn't get

7934
03:32:42,351 --> 03:32:46,700
those crazy like crossfit acids and some
of these girls have now when they look

7935
03:32:46,710 --> 03:32:48,210
like they're a thoroughbred,

7936
03:32:48,230 --> 03:32:49,580
they can leap over a building.

7937
03:32:49,880 --> 03:32:54,080
Some of those crossfit girls that are
developing these muscular acids that

7938
03:32:54,081 --> 03:32:55,970
didn't exist 20 years ago.

7939
03:32:56,120 --> 03:32:59,060
He never saw that you and you
see him like all the time now.

7940
03:33:00,010 --> 03:33:02,270
I don't know if it was
the time I grew up in,

7941
03:33:02,271 --> 03:33:05,970
but I've accepted I'm totally cool.

7942
03:33:05,990 --> 03:33:06,500
Um,

7943
03:33:06,500 --> 03:33:07,370
fake titties,

7944
03:33:07,520 --> 03:33:08,390
real titties,

7945
03:33:08,391 --> 03:33:09,224
fake titties.

7946
03:33:09,320 --> 03:33:10,220
I don't really care.

7947
03:33:10,460 --> 03:33:10,820
You know,

7948
03:33:10,820 --> 03:33:11,653
I'll take either,

7949
03:33:11,930 --> 03:33:13,670
but ass is,

7950
03:33:13,840 --> 03:33:18,290
you can't have a fake ass little where
you cannot have a fake bravos throwing it

7951
03:33:18,291 --> 03:33:19,070
down.

7952
03:33:19,070 --> 03:33:19,281
Like,

7953
03:33:19,281 --> 03:33:19,610
I don't know.

7954
03:33:19,610 --> 03:33:23,210
I can't accept it except I can't.

7955
03:33:23,270 --> 03:33:23,780
Okay.

7956
03:33:23,780 --> 03:33:24,500
Personally,

7957
03:33:24,500 --> 03:33:28,400
do you think maybe in the future if
they came out with a legit fake Dick,

7958
03:33:29,120 --> 03:33:30,320
like legit,

7959
03:33:30,920 --> 03:33:33,290
would that look back go through or not?

7960
03:33:33,470 --> 03:33:36,230
And I'm not talking about like early
prototypes that don't give a shit.

7961
03:33:36,231 --> 03:33:38,490
The problem with the
problem with fake Dick's,

7962
03:33:38,491 --> 03:33:40,110
it'd be like the same
problem with fake boobs.

7963
03:33:40,290 --> 03:33:42,330
If you go back to fake boobs
from the eighties bold,

7964
03:33:42,331 --> 03:33:43,780
now they feel like basketball.

7965
03:33:43,781 --> 03:33:46,770
So things are hard as a rock and
disgusting and they feel weird.

7966
03:33:46,950 --> 03:33:48,540
They don't feel like a fake boob,

7967
03:33:48,780 --> 03:33:53,350
but a fake boob circa 2017
they figured out how to,

7968
03:33:53,351 --> 03:33:54,930
a way to make it soft and mushy.

7969
03:33:54,931 --> 03:33:56,940
It Phil's Phil's outstanding,

7970
03:33:57,030 --> 03:33:57,450
right?

7971
03:33:57,450 --> 03:33:58,283
Agreed.

7972
03:33:59,400 --> 03:33:59,970
Agreed.

7973
03:33:59,970 --> 03:34:02,220
It's got a but a fake Dick.

7974
03:34:02,400 --> 03:34:06,030
I don't think that women would have the
same appreciation for a fake Dick that a

7975
03:34:06,031 --> 03:34:07,230
man has for fake tits.

7976
03:34:07,530 --> 03:34:08,880
I don't think women are buying it.

7977
03:34:08,940 --> 03:34:09,241
No,

7978
03:34:09,241 --> 03:34:09,870
I don't know.

7979
03:34:09,870 --> 03:34:10,550
I think you're right.

7980
03:34:10,550 --> 03:34:10,830
No,

7981
03:34:10,830 --> 03:34:11,663
I think it's the same thing.

7982
03:34:11,700 --> 03:34:13,980
The hair extensions in
two what's going on?

7983
03:34:15,580 --> 03:34:17,400
He can wear your hair extensions ladies.

7984
03:34:18,280 --> 03:34:20,460
Doesn't it seem like a hair transplants?

7985
03:34:20,461 --> 03:34:22,770
We've found out now it's
been 20 years or whatever,

7986
03:34:23,070 --> 03:34:23,970
do or don't work.

7987
03:34:24,330 --> 03:34:25,290
They can work.

7988
03:34:25,320 --> 03:34:27,450
The problem is the rest of
your hair keeps falling out.

7989
03:34:27,850 --> 03:34:29,520
It's like that bit that
I used to do about it,

7990
03:34:29,521 --> 03:34:31,160
that they take hair from a,

7991
03:34:31,170 --> 03:34:31,440
uh,

7992
03:34:31,440 --> 03:34:35,220
it's like taking people
from a neighborhood where
everyone's really healthy and

7993
03:34:35,221 --> 03:34:37,290
move him to an area
where everyone's dying.

7994
03:34:37,650 --> 03:34:39,120
It's like they stay,

7995
03:34:39,240 --> 03:34:42,210
but the other stuff goes away.

7996
03:34:42,510 --> 03:34:43,530
So like for me,

7997
03:34:43,560 --> 03:34:48,560
my problem was I had hair transplants
and the hair that's duck was like all the

7998
03:34:49,141 --> 03:34:52,830
hair I had left and they didn't
like it filled it in at first.

7999
03:34:52,950 --> 03:34:54,820
Then the other stuff
started falling out too,

8000
03:34:55,140 --> 03:34:58,200
and it got to this untenable
position where there was just,

8001
03:34:58,201 --> 03:34:59,210
is not enough hair up there.

8002
03:34:59,220 --> 03:35:00,053
It's a solver.

8003
03:35:00,680 --> 03:35:03,990
It's time to just scorch and burn you.

8004
03:35:04,470 --> 03:35:06,390
I should have shaved
my head from the jump.

8005
03:35:06,420 --> 03:35:07,380
I just wish I did.

8006
03:35:07,710 --> 03:35:08,700
I wish I had shaved it.

8007
03:35:08,880 --> 03:35:09,380
Who's that?

8008
03:35:09,380 --> 03:35:10,260
What do you show him here?

8009
03:35:10,770 --> 03:35:11,161
People.

8010
03:35:11,161 --> 03:35:11,830
Hair transplants.

8011
03:35:11,830 --> 03:35:12,040
There's,

8012
03:35:12,040 --> 03:35:13,620
that's the dude from the Brady bunch.

8013
03:35:13,620 --> 03:35:14,453
Yeah.

8014
03:35:15,630 --> 03:35:15,991
Yeah.

8015
03:35:15,991 --> 03:35:18,570
I mean you can definitely
get your hair thicker,

8016
03:35:18,571 --> 03:35:20,880
but my hair was destined to fall out.

8017
03:35:21,270 --> 03:35:23,730
It depends on like how much your
here is destined to fall out.

8018
03:35:23,731 --> 03:35:24,840
My hair had no chance.

8019
03:35:25,950 --> 03:35:28,170
If you had to like a
little bit of a chance,

8020
03:35:28,171 --> 03:35:31,830
like maybe if you're only thinning
and then it brought it back on,

8021
03:35:31,831 --> 03:35:34,320
but my hair was going son,

8022
03:35:34,380 --> 03:35:35,370
it was on its way out.

8023
03:35:35,790 --> 03:35:37,440
Your hair has to stop dying.

8024
03:35:37,560 --> 03:35:37,881
Yeah,

8025
03:35:37,881 --> 03:35:38,101
yeah,

8026
03:35:38,101 --> 03:35:38,640
yeah.

8027
03:35:38,640 --> 03:35:41,370
And the only way it does
is if you take Propecia,

8028
03:35:41,610 --> 03:35:45,300
which has massive problems of its own
and just really bad for you and causes

8029
03:35:45,301 --> 03:35:47,220
depression and just,

8030
03:35:47,250 --> 03:35:48,480
it's just unhealthy for you.

8031
03:35:48,530 --> 03:35:48,870
You know,

8032
03:35:48,870 --> 03:35:52,950
I told you about one of my singers and
I was a drummer and the speed metal bed,

8033
03:35:53,190 --> 03:35:55,890
what am I senders ended
up getting a extensions.

8034
03:35:56,040 --> 03:35:56,411
Yeah,

8035
03:35:56,411 --> 03:35:57,900
like a whole bunch of extensions.

8036
03:35:57,900 --> 03:35:58,531
There was like a wig.

8037
03:35:58,531 --> 03:35:59,700
It was basically a unit.

8038
03:35:59,730 --> 03:36:00,563
Will you support him?

8039
03:36:00,930 --> 03:36:05,100
Because he had long hair from the age
of nine but he was one of those guys,

8040
03:36:05,101 --> 03:36:05,821
all his brothers,

8041
03:36:05,821 --> 03:36:09,030
they all lose their at 18 so he was
the dude with the longest hair in high

8042
03:36:09,031 --> 03:36:09,600
school,

8043
03:36:09,600 --> 03:36:10,830
but as soon as high school ended,

8044
03:36:10,831 --> 03:36:11,700
he lost all his hair.

8045
03:36:11,850 --> 03:36:12,690
So they decided to,

8046
03:36:12,990 --> 03:36:17,820
he decided to not wear a regular
wig because his older brother.

8047
03:36:17,880 --> 03:36:18,571
Oh Shit.

8048
03:36:18,571 --> 03:36:19,404
Look at this.

8049
03:36:19,770 --> 03:36:20,940
We just literally saw,

8050
03:36:20,941 --> 03:36:21,570
I'm sorry.

8051
03:36:21,570 --> 03:36:23,070
We just literally saw in the highlights,

8052
03:36:23,100 --> 03:36:25,170
the version of the Gary Good rail.

8053
03:36:25,171 --> 03:36:25,530
Yeah,

8054
03:36:25,530 --> 03:36:26,520
but with a hammer fist.

8055
03:36:26,630 --> 03:36:27,271
It was crazy,

8056
03:36:27,271 --> 03:36:27,451
Eddie,

8057
03:36:27,451 --> 03:36:30,390
that you brought that up because
that is exactly what she just did.

8058
03:36:30,990 --> 03:36:31,291
Jamie,

8059
03:36:31,291 --> 03:36:32,280
run that back a little bit.

8060
03:36:32,281 --> 03:36:33,870
We want o hear hand that shit to me.

8061
03:36:35,350 --> 03:36:36,070
Where would we point

8062
03:36:36,070 --> 03:36:36,903
it?

8063
03:36:37,890 --> 03:36:38,723
That TV

8064
03:36:39,620 --> 03:36:40,453
wash this Jay,

8065
03:36:40,470 --> 03:36:43,400
Eddie's so funny that this happened
because this is exactly what you were

8066
03:36:43,401 --> 03:36:44,234
talking about.

8067
03:36:45,570 --> 03:36:46,403
Oh Shit.

8068
03:36:46,560 --> 03:36:47,393
Look at this.

8069
03:36:48,480 --> 03:36:49,950
She got into that position.

8070
03:36:49,980 --> 03:36:51,750
It's literally the same position.

8071
03:36:51,751 --> 03:36:52,411
This is crazy.

8072
03:36:52,411 --> 03:36:53,670
Look at this watch.

8073
03:36:53,760 --> 03:36:54,580
She gets her down,

8074
03:36:54,580 --> 03:36:55,413
she traps it,

8075
03:36:55,470 --> 03:36:56,470
but instead of elbow on,

8076
03:36:56,471 --> 03:36:57,540
she's Hammerfest sinner.

8077
03:36:57,960 --> 03:36:59,520
I mean that's the fucking Gary Goodrich,

8078
03:36:59,521 --> 03:36:59,731
right?

8079
03:36:59,731 --> 03:37:00,840
They're crazy.

8080
03:37:02,350 --> 03:37:03,183
It's crazy.

8081
03:37:03,780 --> 03:37:04,500
That is nuts.

8082
03:37:04,500 --> 03:37:08,190
I haven't seen that since that fight and
it to see it right there that I had no

8083
03:37:08,191 --> 03:37:08,821
idea man.

8084
03:37:08,821 --> 03:37:09,630
Cause that was,

8085
03:37:09,630 --> 03:37:11,890
I think this fight was in
the prelims or whatever.

8086
03:37:11,920 --> 03:37:12,481
I missed it.

8087
03:37:12,481 --> 03:37:13,500
I had no idea.

8088
03:37:13,710 --> 03:37:16,960
I missed it to Carla
Esparza and random Marco's.

8089
03:37:17,800 --> 03:37:18,240
Yeah,

8090
03:37:18,240 --> 03:37:19,260
I had no idea.

8091
03:37:20,060 --> 03:37:21,050
Zero idea.

8092
03:37:21,810 --> 03:37:22,770
What is this Jamie?

8093
03:37:23,190 --> 03:37:26,310
What does that toggle Santos
knocks out Jack Marshman.

8094
03:37:26,330 --> 03:37:26,490
Oh,

8095
03:37:26,490 --> 03:37:27,180
we'll kicked him.

8096
03:37:27,180 --> 03:37:27,451
Bam,

8097
03:37:27,451 --> 03:37:27,721
Bam,

8098
03:37:27,721 --> 03:37:27,991
Bam,

8099
03:37:27,991 --> 03:37:28,261
Bam,

8100
03:37:28,261 --> 03:37:28,650
Bam.

8101
03:37:28,650 --> 03:37:29,483
Wow.

8102
03:37:30,890 --> 03:37:32,280
Thiago Santos is bad ass.

8103
03:37:32,300 --> 03:37:34,050
Look at that blank.

8104
03:37:34,280 --> 03:37:35,360
Oh Jesus.

8105
03:37:36,870 --> 03:37:41,870
How did such a horrible kick to get
hit with your fucking heel with that,

8106
03:37:42,270 --> 03:37:42,800
you like that?

8107
03:37:42,800 --> 03:37:47,050
How bizarre is it still to
this day that you know you,

8108
03:37:47,051 --> 03:37:51,050
you can kick someone full
blast with all your bones,

8109
03:37:51,170 --> 03:37:53,540
but your hands have to be
covered by a leather pad.

8110
03:37:55,210 --> 03:37:56,360
Like how crazy is that?

8111
03:37:56,510 --> 03:38:01,100
You can clang your heel off of
someone's eyeball and no problem.

8112
03:38:01,520 --> 03:38:02,990
The hardest part of your body,

8113
03:38:03,170 --> 03:38:03,351
your,

8114
03:38:03,351 --> 03:38:05,270
he'll literally can stop on the ground.

8115
03:38:05,390 --> 03:38:08,910
It's not another part of your body where
you can walk up to the ground and smash

8116
03:38:08,911 --> 03:38:09,440
up.

8117
03:38:09,440 --> 03:38:10,760
I could stomp on the ground.

8118
03:38:10,761 --> 03:38:12,230
Barefoot is no,

8119
03:38:12,231 --> 03:38:13,370
I can't punch anything.

8120
03:38:13,371 --> 03:38:15,230
Pair handed like I can't punch a tree.

8121
03:38:15,320 --> 03:38:16,700
I stomped trees all time.

8122
03:38:16,701 --> 03:38:17,570
I'll walk up to a tree.

8123
03:38:18,350 --> 03:38:19,430
Doesn't even hurt me at all.

8124
03:38:19,640 --> 03:38:20,320
Right?

8125
03:38:20,320 --> 03:38:21,470
Your heals crazy,

8126
03:38:21,500 --> 03:38:21,980
your heels,

8127
03:38:21,980 --> 03:38:25,970
it crazy bone and the fact that you
could bounce that off someone's head when

8128
03:38:25,971 --> 03:38:30,620
you're spinning around like a Ballerina
full blast and whip your leg into their

8129
03:38:30,621 --> 03:38:32,090
head swollen like a bat,

8130
03:38:32,180 --> 03:38:32,870
but you can't,

8131
03:38:32,870 --> 03:38:34,070
you can't have bare knuckles.

8132
03:38:34,310 --> 03:38:35,270
It's so bizarre.

8133
03:38:35,690 --> 03:38:38,060
Rogan fighting championships right there.

8134
03:38:38,160 --> 03:38:39,160
If I turn the skull,

8135
03:38:39,410 --> 03:38:43,580
if I changed him and that's why I
would want a hundred percent change.

8136
03:38:43,610 --> 03:38:44,443
Bare knuckled,

8137
03:38:44,510 --> 03:38:45,860
I don't care what anybody says.

8138
03:38:46,190 --> 03:38:46,911
And when you say,

8139
03:38:46,911 --> 03:38:48,260
well you break your hands that way,

8140
03:38:48,261 --> 03:38:49,940
well you then you shouldn't be doing that.

8141
03:38:50,330 --> 03:38:53,460
Then we should figure out
what actually no wraps,

8142
03:38:53,461 --> 03:38:54,020
sir.

8143
03:38:54,020 --> 03:38:54,853
No wraps.

8144
03:38:55,040 --> 03:38:55,940
This is what I think.

8145
03:38:56,030 --> 03:38:56,900
I think what,

8146
03:38:57,110 --> 03:38:57,470
what,

8147
03:38:57,470 --> 03:38:59,060
what actually works.

8148
03:38:59,240 --> 03:39:04,240
If you don't have anything tightened
up unnaturally with wraps and tape and

8149
03:39:04,311 --> 03:39:05,390
gauze and t,

8150
03:39:05,391 --> 03:39:08,990
you've essentially got like a soft
cast that keeps your wrist in place,

8151
03:39:09,110 --> 03:39:11,660
that allows you to just
throw bombs with impunity.

8152
03:39:11,690 --> 03:39:16,650
I don't think that makes any sense because
that's not a real skill in the real,

8153
03:39:16,660 --> 03:39:16,851
I mean,

8154
03:39:16,851 --> 03:39:17,750
you can still punch people,

8155
03:39:17,751 --> 03:39:20,940
but it's not a realistic
application of luck.

8156
03:39:20,960 --> 03:39:23,780
What could happen with two
people just using their bodies.

8157
03:39:23,930 --> 03:39:26,360
You've added in this extra element of rap.

8158
03:39:26,570 --> 03:39:27,170
Okay.

8159
03:39:27,170 --> 03:39:28,850
That's the same way I feel about the cage.

8160
03:39:29,060 --> 03:39:32,240
I feel like the cage allows people to
get taken down and stand back up where

8161
03:39:32,241 --> 03:39:33,074
they might not be able,

8162
03:39:33,080 --> 03:39:33,920
it's ads in

8163
03:39:34,070 --> 03:39:36,710
this artificial thing
that you're handling.

8164
03:39:36,720 --> 03:39:38,690
You have to deal with no raps,

8165
03:39:38,870 --> 03:39:41,090
no cage basketball court.

8166
03:39:41,750 --> 03:39:42,531
We already got that.

8167
03:39:42,531 --> 03:39:43,364
An Ebi.

8168
03:39:43,710 --> 03:39:44,310
Yeah.

8169
03:39:44,310 --> 03:39:44,540
Yeah.

8170
03:39:44,540 --> 03:39:45,640
That's basically bi.

8171
03:39:45,820 --> 03:39:47,980
W s very similar except with Ebi.

8172
03:39:47,990 --> 03:39:48,500
You're not throwing,

8173
03:39:48,500 --> 03:39:49,580
throwing kicks and punches,

8174
03:39:49,790 --> 03:39:51,590
combat Jiu Jitsu are that starts,

8175
03:39:51,620 --> 03:39:52,880
but you're not kicking head kick,

8176
03:39:52,890 --> 03:39:53,370
you know?

8177
03:39:53,370 --> 03:39:54,190
Nope.

8178
03:39:54,190 --> 03:39:55,430
Or palm strikes now,

8179
03:39:55,670 --> 03:39:56,450
but on the ground,

8180
03:39:56,450 --> 03:39:57,231
but only on the ground.

8181
03:39:57,231 --> 03:39:58,064
Not standing up,

8182
03:39:58,390 --> 03:39:58,970
wrestling,

8183
03:39:58,970 --> 03:39:59,803
standing up.

8184
03:39:59,810 --> 03:40:01,400
Only on the ground palm strikes.

8185
03:40:01,550 --> 03:40:06,230
It's designed not to add
knockouts are Tkos to the show,

8186
03:40:06,380 --> 03:40:08,000
but to open submissions up.

8187
03:40:08,390 --> 03:40:08,660
No,

8188
03:40:08,660 --> 03:40:10,610
there will be an a TKL every now and then,

8189
03:40:10,611 --> 03:40:12,890
but I don't think there's going to
be that many with just your homes.

8190
03:40:12,950 --> 03:40:14,000
Do you ask no elbows?

8191
03:40:14,001 --> 03:40:14,600
No nothing.

8192
03:40:14,600 --> 03:40:14,691
Oh,

8193
03:40:14,691 --> 03:40:16,610
but some guys can hit so
hard with their palms.

8194
03:40:16,611 --> 03:40:20,600
Remember boss smashing guys
with his palms rushing him.

8195
03:40:20,630 --> 03:40:24,230
Well he figured out a way to
pull his hands with my hand.

8196
03:40:24,230 --> 03:40:25,610
Doesn't even go that far back.

8197
03:40:25,880 --> 03:40:27,260
Like my hand stops.

8198
03:40:27,280 --> 03:40:28,113
He was right there.

8199
03:40:28,260 --> 03:40:29,780
That's as far as my hand goes back.

8200
03:40:29,781 --> 03:40:34,730
But boss gets his fucking hand
back like an extra 10 15 degrees.

8201
03:40:35,000 --> 03:40:37,130
I don't know if he stretched
it or it's natural.

8202
03:40:37,220 --> 03:40:38,930
So he was just throwing punches.

8203
03:40:39,260 --> 03:40:42,530
He was throwing palm strike
punches and just smashing guys.

8204
03:40:42,560 --> 03:40:43,011
Well here,

8205
03:40:43,011 --> 03:40:47,240
if you a accidentally throw an
elbow or a closed fist strike,

8206
03:40:47,540 --> 03:40:50,150
stop the time that guy
gets to be on your back.

8207
03:40:50,151 --> 03:40:51,240
Just like Ebi overtime.

8208
03:40:51,320 --> 03:40:53,700
And then we start in regulations.

8209
03:40:53,701 --> 03:40:56,600
Still start with the guy on your back
with the leg hooks because you can't take

8210
03:40:56,601 --> 03:40:58,010
a point away when there's no points.

8211
03:40:58,760 --> 03:40:59,593
There's no points.

8212
03:40:59,720 --> 03:41:00,553
So what do you do?

8213
03:41:00,830 --> 03:41:01,730
You have right there,

8214
03:41:01,731 --> 03:41:02,091
Bam.

8215
03:41:02,091 --> 03:41:02,924
Any,

8216
03:41:03,020 --> 03:41:06,560
any clear elbow striker
closed fist strike.

8217
03:41:06,770 --> 03:41:08,930
I stopped the time you start on the back,

8218
03:41:08,950 --> 03:41:13,200
you know that'll just ensure the no
one's tries to take you know that that

8219
03:41:13,250 --> 03:41:13,940
warning shot.

8220
03:41:13,940 --> 03:41:14,061
Oh,

8221
03:41:14,061 --> 03:41:14,894
that was just a warning.

8222
03:41:15,050 --> 03:41:15,651
No warning.

8223
03:41:15,651 --> 03:41:16,550
It's clear shot.

8224
03:41:16,970 --> 03:41:21,620
That's automatic penalty if they Kayo
and with that punch or an elbow because

8225
03:41:21,621 --> 03:41:23,150
the problem with that is if somebody,

8226
03:41:23,151 --> 03:41:26,090
that's a promise sacrifice that that
might be want to sacrifice that.

8227
03:41:26,091 --> 03:41:27,470
If they want to catch somebody on the jaw,

8228
03:41:27,680 --> 03:41:28,513
they get,

8229
03:41:28,630 --> 03:41:29,460
it's a DQ.

8230
03:41:29,460 --> 03:41:30,293
Have to be a deal.

8231
03:41:31,110 --> 03:41:32,660
If the guy gets knocked out DQ.

8232
03:41:32,720 --> 03:41:34,400
What if the guy gets really hurt too?

8233
03:41:34,401 --> 03:41:35,234
We give them five.

8234
03:41:35,350 --> 03:41:38,360
I give them five minutes to recover and
then he's going to be on Dude's back

8235
03:41:38,361 --> 03:41:39,021
from that point on.

8236
03:41:39,021 --> 03:41:41,330
What if he says after the five
minutes he can't come back?

8237
03:41:41,810 --> 03:41:43,070
What if he says he got too fucked up?

8238
03:41:43,071 --> 03:41:45,350
Like what if somebody drops a bomb
on him and he stays conscious,

8239
03:41:45,560 --> 03:41:45,981
but he's like,

8240
03:41:45,981 --> 03:41:46,281
dude,

8241
03:41:46,281 --> 03:41:46,971
I'm out of it.

8242
03:41:46,971 --> 03:41:48,080
My feet aren't working.

8243
03:41:48,290 --> 03:41:49,250
I can't do this.

8244
03:41:49,250 --> 03:41:49,671
I can't go.

8245
03:41:49,671 --> 03:41:53,240
I can't get hit again to Dq Dq,

8246
03:41:54,530 --> 03:41:57,590
so that'll live the opening
for guys to to fake it.

8247
03:41:57,620 --> 03:41:58,151
That's a double.

8248
03:41:58,151 --> 03:41:59,240
That's a double DQ.

8249
03:41:59,660 --> 03:41:59,901
No,

8250
03:41:59,901 --> 03:42:00,681
the guy that threw it,

8251
03:42:00,681 --> 03:42:01,880
it's going to be dqued for sure.

8252
03:42:01,881 --> 03:42:02,180
Right?

8253
03:42:02,180 --> 03:42:02,620
For sure.

8254
03:42:02,620 --> 03:42:03,453
Guided through it,

8255
03:42:03,770 --> 03:42:06,920
but it also leaves room for
someone to fake it that,

8256
03:42:06,921 --> 03:42:09,860
but it wasn't that hard both out and the
other guy wins because we're only doing

8257
03:42:09,861 --> 03:42:11,640
four man combat Jujitsu.

8258
03:42:11,680 --> 03:42:11,980
Turn it.

8259
03:42:11,980 --> 03:42:12,500
Okay.

8260
03:42:12,500 --> 03:42:13,370
It's a four man thing.

8261
03:42:13,490 --> 03:42:15,360
We're still doing the regular Ebi rule.

8262
03:42:15,361 --> 03:42:17,600
16 land welterweight tournament Sunday,

8263
03:42:17,601 --> 03:42:19,250
March 5th on UFC fight pass,

8264
03:42:19,700 --> 03:42:23,750
but in between the rounds of the
regular Ebi 16 Man Tournament,

8265
03:42:23,840 --> 03:42:26,270
there's going to be a four man
combat Jiu Jitsu tournament.

8266
03:42:26,510 --> 03:42:27,200
Wow.

8267
03:42:27,200 --> 03:42:27,800
Yeah.

8268
03:42:27,800 --> 03:42:29,420
We got some animals doing it,

8269
03:42:29,421 --> 03:42:30,020
dude.

8270
03:42:30,020 --> 03:42:31,280
Fucking beast,

8271
03:42:31,290 --> 03:42:31,501
man.

8272
03:42:31,501 --> 03:42:31,980
It's going to be

8273
03:42:31,980 --> 03:42:32,970
interesting how it turns out.

8274
03:42:33,410 --> 03:42:34,500
Imagine Ebi,

8275
03:42:34,740 --> 03:42:37,770
but you can palm strike as
hard as you can on the floor.

8276
03:42:37,910 --> 03:42:39,470
Combat Sambo combat.

8277
03:42:39,471 --> 03:42:43,640
Sambo is one of the best martial
arts for people enter into MMA.

8278
03:42:44,330 --> 03:42:45,810
Even number Grumet off.

8279
03:42:45,811 --> 03:42:48,060
You see with or and combat sambo.

8280
03:42:48,210 --> 03:42:51,710
You fight with a judogi on
with stripe on the lake shore.

8281
03:42:52,120 --> 03:42:52,953
Yeah.

8282
03:42:53,230 --> 03:42:53,730
No,

8283
03:42:53,730 --> 03:42:53,880
no.

8284
03:42:53,880 --> 03:42:54,120
Sure,

8285
03:42:54,120 --> 03:42:54,953
sure,

8286
03:42:55,010 --> 03:42:55,731
sure it is.

8287
03:42:55,731 --> 03:42:56,011
It is.

8288
03:42:56,011 --> 03:42:57,520
It always short and it
gets a little short.

8289
03:42:57,521 --> 03:42:58,261
It's not full length.

8290
03:42:58,261 --> 03:42:58,810
He had been there.

8291
03:42:58,810 --> 03:42:59,643
That goes back here.

8292
03:42:59,850 --> 03:43:00,600
It's like the,

8293
03:43:00,600 --> 03:43:03,150
it's enough that you could
get a good grip on each other.

8294
03:43:03,370 --> 03:43:04,470
They're cut off sleeves,

8295
03:43:04,471 --> 03:43:04,651
man.

8296
03:43:04,651 --> 03:43:05,880
I think they're like karate kid.

8297
03:43:05,910 --> 03:43:06,850
Like Kilkee Shin a thing.

8298
03:43:06,851 --> 03:43:07,630
I think so.

8299
03:43:07,630 --> 03:43:08,580
I think it's like the thing,

8300
03:43:08,581 --> 03:43:09,130
it's like,

8301
03:43:09,130 --> 03:43:10,140
it's almost like it is,

8302
03:43:10,380 --> 03:43:13,620
I think a little sleeve fate combat sambo.

8303
03:43:13,621 --> 03:43:15,870
I think it's more long
than you think it is.

8304
03:43:15,870 --> 03:43:19,350
I think I know what you're thinking
of variations there will be different,

8305
03:43:20,070 --> 03:43:23,160
but I believe probably
that should be a Jujitsu.

8306
03:43:23,760 --> 03:43:27,360
He's got a full sleeves fedoras fighting
in combat against the guy from the

8307
03:43:27,361 --> 03:43:28,194
university that,

8308
03:43:28,420 --> 03:43:30,030
and we know what they do have though.

8309
03:43:30,031 --> 03:43:30,390
The,

8310
03:43:30,390 --> 03:43:31,021
Oh damn.

8311
03:43:31,021 --> 03:43:32,340
Fado was a beast in this shit.

8312
03:43:32,341 --> 03:43:34,410
See this is not in a cage
and they're fighting.

8313
03:43:35,100 --> 03:43:36,910
They also have shoes on,

8314
03:43:37,350 --> 03:43:38,900
but they're doing ground impound.

8315
03:43:38,940 --> 03:43:41,930
Look at this with headgear
on has got to stop.

8316
03:43:42,000 --> 03:43:45,240
The world is not as is missing something
here and look what they've been doing.

8317
03:43:45,570 --> 03:43:47,190
They've been doing this for a long time.

8318
03:43:47,400 --> 03:43:47,880
The world,

8319
03:43:47,880 --> 03:43:50,430
the world really needs to zero in on what,

8320
03:43:50,640 --> 03:43:53,040
what they're doing in
Russia with the combat sambo

8321
03:43:54,780 --> 03:43:54,930
now.

8322
03:43:54,930 --> 03:43:55,830
But let me ask you this,

8323
03:43:55,950 --> 03:44:00,950
why is that better with Judogi on
instead of just doing combat sambo,

8324
03:44:01,200 --> 03:44:03,060
like MMA amateur style.

8325
03:44:03,060 --> 03:44:04,080
Cause that's really what it is.

8326
03:44:04,290 --> 03:44:06,900
It's just there's more grappling because
they're allowed to grab ahold of the

8327
03:44:06,901 --> 03:44:07,340
Geek.

8328
03:44:07,340 --> 03:44:07,520
Yeah.

8329
03:44:07,520 --> 03:44:10,770
It's very strange because in a lot of
ways you could get more vulnerable.

8330
03:44:11,010 --> 03:44:13,290
You're putting yourself into
positions that you might not be in.

8331
03:44:13,291 --> 03:44:14,124
So they're doing,

8332
03:44:14,340 --> 03:44:16,260
they're doing a version of MMA,

8333
03:44:16,410 --> 03:44:20,130
but you can grab each other better because
you have all the g like this kind of

8334
03:44:20,131 --> 03:44:20,940
shit.

8335
03:44:20,940 --> 03:44:22,170
And you also,

8336
03:44:22,460 --> 03:44:23,340
there's no cage.

8337
03:44:23,550 --> 03:44:26,040
The basic idea they're doing,

8338
03:44:26,050 --> 03:44:27,000
it's the size of vote,

8339
03:44:27,030 --> 03:44:28,610
like an Olympic wrestling match.

8340
03:44:28,890 --> 03:44:29,310
Yep.

8341
03:44:29,310 --> 03:44:29,820
Right.

8342
03:44:29,820 --> 03:44:30,511
That's all you need.

8343
03:44:30,511 --> 03:44:31,344
You don't need,

8344
03:44:32,130 --> 03:44:32,963
you don't need a cage.

8345
03:44:33,240 --> 03:44:34,620
It's better off without a cage.

8346
03:44:34,680 --> 03:44:35,310
Honestly,

8347
03:44:35,310 --> 03:44:38,790
it's way better off without a
cage and when people stand up,

8348
03:44:38,820 --> 03:44:40,380
they actually have to stand up.

8349
03:44:40,620 --> 03:44:42,180
You can't push up against the end,

8350
03:44:42,330 --> 03:44:43,770
better seating for everybody.

8351
03:44:43,771 --> 03:44:44,640
You could see better.

8352
03:44:44,670 --> 03:44:46,710
That's the most important
thing right there.

8353
03:44:46,710 --> 03:44:51,030
The most important thing is you
can see way better as a spectator,

8354
03:44:51,210 --> 03:44:53,010
but it's new IFCs most of the time,

8355
03:44:53,011 --> 03:44:54,510
most of the guys are
looking at the big screens.

8356
03:44:54,630 --> 03:44:56,310
It's hard to see through the cage.

8357
03:44:56,400 --> 03:44:57,990
It's hard to see through the fence.

8358
03:44:58,380 --> 03:45:01,470
It's that easy to see through the house
as you keep psychos from different

8359
03:45:01,510 --> 03:45:04,860
rushing onto the mat and you
know working people in the head,

8360
03:45:04,890 --> 03:45:05,570
no you don't want to,

8361
03:45:05,570 --> 03:45:06,450
you're not going to do that.

8362
03:45:06,451 --> 03:45:07,290
I NMA event.

8363
03:45:07,291 --> 03:45:09,960
Those guys or those guys would
never have the balls to do that.

8364
03:45:09,961 --> 03:45:10,290
Dude.

8365
03:45:10,290 --> 03:45:15,290
You imagine if Anderson Silva like
lost by some funky way and people were

8366
03:45:15,361 --> 03:45:18,090
betting and there's a bunch of Brazilians
in the crowd and they stormed the

8367
03:45:18,091 --> 03:45:21,350
American stormed cause
say 1990 setting show.

8368
03:45:21,360 --> 03:45:22,193
It can happen.

8369
03:45:22,320 --> 03:45:22,561
Look,

8370
03:45:22,561 --> 03:45:23,370
dude,

8371
03:45:23,370 --> 03:45:25,830
people get in fights all
the time inside the ring.

8372
03:45:27,330 --> 03:45:28,590
I like the no cage at all.

8373
03:45:28,740 --> 03:45:30,050
What do you think about the GE?

8374
03:45:30,610 --> 03:45:31,620
I think that's okay.

8375
03:45:32,330 --> 03:45:33,730
He's taking a totally different approach.

8376
03:45:34,600 --> 03:45:35,470
I don't see a problem with that.

8377
03:45:35,471 --> 03:45:36,070
It's different.

8378
03:45:36,070 --> 03:45:36,850
You know what I mean?

8379
03:45:36,850 --> 03:45:38,440
At least there's punches and strikes.

8380
03:45:38,500 --> 03:45:39,041
Oh yeah man.

8381
03:45:39,041 --> 03:45:39,461
I know what I mean.

8382
03:45:39,461 --> 03:45:40,261
So the Gig,

8383
03:45:40,261 --> 03:45:41,350
there's nothing wrong with the gay,

8384
03:45:42,020 --> 03:45:43,180
you know right here.

8385
03:45:43,590 --> 03:45:44,423
It's amazing.

8386
03:45:45,040 --> 03:45:45,730
It's amazing.

8387
03:45:45,730 --> 03:45:45,930
Okay.

8388
03:45:45,930 --> 03:45:48,970
You might not want to grab the sleeves
as much if someone can punch you,

8389
03:45:49,090 --> 03:45:49,511
you know,

8390
03:45:49,511 --> 03:45:52,000
I think maybe you don't
grab the sleeves as much,

8391
03:45:52,030 --> 03:45:52,540
you know?

8392
03:45:52,540 --> 03:45:53,081
I don't know.

8393
03:45:53,081 --> 03:45:54,480
I haven't really even looked at this.

8394
03:45:54,690 --> 03:45:56,440
This is going to start
paying attention to this

8395
03:45:56,800 --> 03:45:57,820
crazy way to fight,

8396
03:45:57,821 --> 03:45:58,001
man.

8397
03:45:58,001 --> 03:45:59,860
Cause he can hold you in this position.

8398
03:46:00,180 --> 03:46:00,601
That shit.

8399
03:46:00,601 --> 03:46:00,850
Anyway,

8400
03:46:00,850 --> 03:46:03,670
he's pounding on you with
a Gian in a lot of ways.

8401
03:46:03,671 --> 03:46:05,620
It's more dangerous and a lot of ways,

8402
03:46:05,621 --> 03:46:07,030
this is your argument,

8403
03:46:07,070 --> 03:46:07,480
Eddie,

8404
03:46:07,480 --> 03:46:08,201
for MMA.

8405
03:46:08,201 --> 03:46:09,820
Like there's no grease involved here.

8406
03:46:09,920 --> 03:46:10,520
No grease.

8407
03:46:10,520 --> 03:46:11,470
Zero Greece.

8408
03:46:11,490 --> 03:46:12,170
Yeah,

8409
03:46:12,170 --> 03:46:13,610
and they're wearing jackets.

8410
03:46:14,360 --> 03:46:17,330
I'm saying make them
wear Reebok rash guards.

8411
03:46:17,331 --> 03:46:18,740
It'd be so goddamn cool

8412
03:46:18,840 --> 03:46:20,310
or let them continue to,

8413
03:46:20,311 --> 03:46:20,461
oh,

8414
03:46:20,461 --> 03:46:21,031
he just ripped.

8415
03:46:21,031 --> 03:46:22,220
That guy showed the shore.

8416
03:46:22,530 --> 03:46:25,860
I mean maybe let them
wear the judo pants too.

8417
03:46:26,730 --> 03:46:27,563
It how much,

8418
03:46:27,590 --> 03:46:29,330
how about let them wear
whatever they want.

8419
03:46:29,331 --> 03:46:30,410
If they want to wear a rash guard,

8420
03:46:30,411 --> 03:46:30,741
they can.

8421
03:46:30,741 --> 03:46:31,251
If they don't,

8422
03:46:31,251 --> 03:46:31,940
they don't have to,

8423
03:46:31,940 --> 03:46:32,451
but here's a,

8424
03:46:32,451 --> 03:46:33,470
here's a whatever they want.

8425
03:46:33,590 --> 03:46:37,970
Here's a point to think about the way
he is right here with the shorts on.

8426
03:46:38,240 --> 03:46:42,290
It's not as big of a factor because we're
where he's going to most of the time

8427
03:46:42,291 --> 03:46:44,600
be in contact with is covered with cloth,

8428
03:46:45,020 --> 03:46:45,460
right?

8429
03:46:45,460 --> 03:46:45,590
Yeah,

8430
03:46:45,590 --> 03:46:47,840
because his legs are going to be
wrapped around the other guys.

8431
03:46:47,841 --> 03:46:48,680
Upper Body.

8432
03:46:48,800 --> 03:46:50,630
It's going to be a
wrapped around his arms.

8433
03:46:50,720 --> 03:46:51,950
All that stuff's covered in cost,

8434
03:46:51,951 --> 03:46:53,480
so he doesn't even need pants.

8435
03:46:53,510 --> 03:46:53,870
Yeah,

8436
03:46:53,870 --> 03:46:55,790
so it's just a different approach.

8437
03:46:55,910 --> 03:46:58,220
Instead of using a rash
guard like you came up with,

8438
03:46:58,250 --> 03:46:59,830
it's just using MMA.

8439
03:46:59,880 --> 03:47:01,730
Maybe combat sambos the fucking way to go.

8440
03:47:01,910 --> 03:47:03,320
Maybe that's a geek for real.

8441
03:47:04,820 --> 03:47:06,410
Maybe when you really
stop and think about it,

8442
03:47:06,411 --> 03:47:07,244
man,

8443
03:47:07,760 --> 03:47:08,593
man,

8444
03:47:10,040 --> 03:47:10,521
that's a,

8445
03:47:10,521 --> 03:47:11,354
that's a really,

8446
03:47:11,440 --> 03:47:12,770
because they're already doing it.

8447
03:47:12,771 --> 03:47:13,604
They got it down.

8448
03:47:13,730 --> 03:47:14,481
They shut out of there.

8449
03:47:14,481 --> 03:47:16,070
You should have a variation for an Ebi.

8450
03:47:16,610 --> 03:47:16,791
Well,

8451
03:47:16,791 --> 03:47:17,241
you know what,

8452
03:47:17,241 --> 03:47:18,350
with combat Jujitsu,

8453
03:47:18,440 --> 03:47:19,760
we're going to see how that goes first.

8454
03:47:19,870 --> 03:47:21,200
It could be a disaster.

8455
03:47:21,260 --> 03:47:21,471
Yes,

8456
03:47:21,471 --> 03:47:24,650
it could be a total disaster
or it could be a total success.

8457
03:47:24,830 --> 03:47:25,201
It's going to be,

8458
03:47:25,201 --> 03:47:26,034
you know,

8459
03:47:26,040 --> 03:47:28,370
I think Jiu Jitsu with some palm strikes,

8460
03:47:28,400 --> 03:47:30,560
I don't know how that can be bad.

8461
03:47:30,800 --> 03:47:31,880
I don't know how that can fail.

8462
03:47:31,881 --> 03:47:32,360
It's an,

8463
03:47:32,360 --> 03:47:33,770
it's a little closer to MMA.

8464
03:47:33,771 --> 03:47:34,604
It's not an a,

8465
03:47:34,650 --> 03:47:35,510
it's not even close,

8466
03:47:35,511 --> 03:47:38,270
but it's a little closer
than your regular submission.

8467
03:47:38,271 --> 03:47:39,260
Only Jiu Jitsu match.

8468
03:47:39,860 --> 03:47:41,550
So to this

8469
03:47:41,800 --> 03:47:43,180
fade or when he was at king,

8470
03:47:43,450 --> 03:47:44,170
he'll get here fade.

8471
03:47:44,170 --> 03:47:46,570
Oregon's semi shell look at this shit man.

8472
03:47:46,960 --> 03:47:48,310
Holy Shit.

8473
03:47:48,550 --> 03:47:50,320
He was so dominant dude.

8474
03:47:51,190 --> 03:47:52,510
And you know the one thing,

8475
03:47:53,080 --> 03:47:54,040
oh Jesus.

8476
03:47:54,240 --> 03:47:57,970
And one thing you got to read really be
impressed with when it comes to faith

8477
03:47:57,971 --> 03:48:01,210
oars victories is that he
fought that crazy shit.

8478
03:48:01,211 --> 03:48:03,910
When you can stomp and
soccer kick like go get that.

8479
03:48:04,450 --> 03:48:09,010
I mean that is just a wild way of fighting
during the pride days when he was the

8480
03:48:09,011 --> 03:48:09,700
king,

8481
03:48:09,700 --> 03:48:11,680
when he was the best fucking
heavyweight in the world,

8482
03:48:12,040 --> 03:48:15,190
they have the craziest
rule system in all of MMA.

8483
03:48:15,820 --> 03:48:16,630
Stomps,

8484
03:48:16,630 --> 03:48:17,920
soccer kicks.

8485
03:48:18,370 --> 03:48:21,330
You could basically do anything that
you needed to hit on the ground.

8486
03:48:21,720 --> 03:48:22,553
Yes.

8487
03:48:23,160 --> 03:48:23,993
Ooh,

8488
03:48:24,040 --> 03:48:24,873
yeah man.

8489
03:48:25,210 --> 03:48:25,421
Dude,

8490
03:48:25,421 --> 03:48:26,410
he was a monster.

8491
03:48:27,350 --> 03:48:27,891
Big Daddy.

8492
03:48:27,891 --> 03:48:28,070
There's

8493
03:48:28,070 --> 03:48:28,903
big daddy.

8494
03:48:29,840 --> 03:48:30,710
Big Daddy comes up.

8495
03:48:30,730 --> 03:48:31,563
Yep.

8496
03:48:32,480 --> 03:48:32,961
Boom,

8497
03:48:32,961 --> 03:48:33,501
boom,

8498
03:48:33,501 --> 03:48:33,981
boom,

8499
03:48:33,981 --> 03:48:34,491
boom,

8500
03:48:34,491 --> 03:48:35,324
boom.

8501
03:48:36,440 --> 03:48:37,161
Come on man.

8502
03:48:37,161 --> 03:48:38,000
I have pictures of me.

8503
03:48:38,001 --> 03:48:43,001
And when Daddy got Amsterdam Training
Jiu Jitsu from 2001 well this one Kevin

8504
03:48:44,231 --> 03:48:46,280
random and slammed him
and as he's going down,

8505
03:48:46,281 --> 03:48:47,570
he's holding on looking at him.

8506
03:48:47,571 --> 03:48:52,000
He's literally landing on his
head trying to hold onto a Komora.

8507
03:48:52,370 --> 03:48:56,210
I mean who survives like that and then
the escapes and taps him right here.

8508
03:48:56,211 --> 03:48:56,390
Yeah,

8509
03:48:56,390 --> 03:48:57,380
he got him in a Kamora.

8510
03:49:00,110 --> 03:49:00,490
Yeah.

8511
03:49:00,490 --> 03:49:01,610
Fader was something special,

8512
03:49:01,611 --> 03:49:02,120
man.

8513
03:49:02,120 --> 03:49:02,953
He was really something.

8514
03:49:04,010 --> 03:49:05,870
He just got up reversed.

8515
03:49:05,900 --> 03:49:07,010
Just rolled them over.

8516
03:49:07,040 --> 03:49:07,430
Yeah.

8517
03:49:07,430 --> 03:49:08,263
That's crazy.

8518
03:49:08,930 --> 03:49:10,460
Loosen them up with these punches.

8519
03:49:10,610 --> 03:49:12,230
Trap the arm and Bingo.

8520
03:49:12,290 --> 03:49:13,123
Got It.

8521
03:49:13,600 --> 03:49:13,870
Yup.

8522
03:49:13,870 --> 03:49:14,720
It's going right to that.

8523
03:49:14,721 --> 03:49:15,620
He's not messing around.

8524
03:49:16,670 --> 03:49:18,110
It's like it's hard to knock someone out.

8525
03:49:18,280 --> 03:49:18,920
Look at that.

8526
03:49:18,920 --> 03:49:22,220
As soon as you wrap that
up tab to get outta here.

8527
03:49:22,850 --> 03:49:25,280
He was also knock dudes
out from that position.

8528
03:49:25,340 --> 03:49:25,810
He,

8529
03:49:25,810 --> 03:49:28,250
the other thing that you
gotta give him credit for,

8530
03:49:28,620 --> 03:49:32,180
you've got to get fade or credit for the
ability to tap guys out and knocked him

8531
03:49:32,181 --> 03:49:33,014
out.

8532
03:49:33,510 --> 03:49:36,590
Cause he was a guy that was always
threatening with submissions,

8533
03:49:36,620 --> 03:49:37,960
catching people with a armbars,

8534
03:49:38,060 --> 03:49:39,920
catching people Kimora is everything.

8535
03:49:40,250 --> 03:49:40,491
Yeah,

8536
03:49:40,491 --> 03:49:41,390
he could do everything.

8537
03:49:41,391 --> 03:49:42,081
He could rear naked,

8538
03:49:42,081 --> 03:49:46,790
choke you everything and he would
explode and take everything that was

8539
03:49:46,791 --> 03:49:47,360
available.

8540
03:49:47,360 --> 03:49:51,530
Would you allow and Rogan
finding championships in
basketball arenas with rash

8541
03:49:51,531 --> 03:49:51,771
guards.

8542
03:49:51,771 --> 03:49:54,170
Would you allow a stomps to the head?

8543
03:49:54,290 --> 03:49:54,980
Yes.

8544
03:49:54,980 --> 03:49:56,660
What about a kicks?

8545
03:49:56,730 --> 03:49:59,870
And he said everything
hundred percent Dan.

8546
03:50:00,090 --> 03:50:01,490
Hundred percent we need a backer.

8547
03:50:01,690 --> 03:50:02,523
No,

8548
03:50:02,720 --> 03:50:03,710
no gloves.

8549
03:50:03,920 --> 03:50:04,731
Knees to the head.

8550
03:50:04,731 --> 03:50:05,780
Soccer kicks to the head,

8551
03:50:05,810 --> 03:50:06,940
but really good referees.

8552
03:50:07,720 --> 03:50:08,553
Crazy.

8553
03:50:08,600 --> 03:50:09,600
Some crazy millionaire.

8554
03:50:09,601 --> 03:50:10,670
I wanted to finance it.

8555
03:50:10,880 --> 03:50:11,571
I'd say good luck,

8556
03:50:11,571 --> 03:50:11,841
dude.

8557
03:50:11,841 --> 03:50:12,650
You could use my name.

8558
03:50:12,650 --> 03:50:13,190
Oh really?

8559
03:50:13,190 --> 03:50:13,311
Yeah,

8560
03:50:13,311 --> 03:50:13,611
go ahead.

8561
03:50:13,611 --> 03:50:13,880
Rogan.

8562
03:50:13,880 --> 03:50:14,713
Funny Championships.

8563
03:50:14,750 --> 03:50:15,381
Oh Shit.

8564
03:50:15,381 --> 03:50:15,761
Let's do,

8565
03:50:15,761 --> 03:50:16,481
I think it's got to be,

8566
03:50:16,481 --> 03:50:18,380
so if you do really well,

8567
03:50:18,381 --> 03:50:19,214
eventually I'm gonna see you.

8568
03:50:19,700 --> 03:50:20,533
But uh,

8569
03:50:21,390 --> 03:50:22,100
not a sewer.

8570
03:50:22,100 --> 03:50:22,281
They,

8571
03:50:22,281 --> 03:50:23,630
it's not a good name for it anyway.

8572
03:50:23,631 --> 03:50:27,010
It should be something like
unlimited fighting or so broken.

8573
03:50:27,100 --> 03:50:27,933
Now I,

8574
03:50:27,980 --> 03:50:28,880
you shouldn't have my name in it.

8575
03:50:28,881 --> 03:50:30,040
It should be something like,

8576
03:50:30,041 --> 03:50:30,380
um,

8577
03:50:30,380 --> 03:50:30,890
they should,

8578
03:50:30,890 --> 03:50:33,800
you should come up with
some name that like,

8579
03:50:33,830 --> 03:50:37,670
that shows how it has the most,

8580
03:50:38,810 --> 03:50:40,040
the most limited

8581
03:50:41,600 --> 03:50:43,170
restrictions player of the year.

8582
03:50:44,220 --> 03:50:44,940
It can get the HR,

8583
03:50:44,940 --> 03:50:45,860
no gloves,

8584
03:50:45,950 --> 03:50:48,500
no gloves on the Indian reservation,

8585
03:50:48,501 --> 03:50:49,334
right

8586
03:50:50,410 --> 03:50:51,040
or wrong.

8587
03:50:51,040 --> 03:50:51,590
Gore,

8588
03:50:51,590 --> 03:50:51,970
Mexico,

8589
03:50:51,970 --> 03:50:52,803
Bubba casino.

8590
03:50:53,000 --> 03:50:55,640
That might be Mexico's when he
was doing a basketball arena,

8591
03:50:55,800 --> 03:50:58,970
hologram basketball and an
on an Indian reservation.

8592
03:50:59,230 --> 03:50:59,840
You need,

8593
03:50:59,840 --> 03:51:01,550
he would need really good security though,

8594
03:51:01,551 --> 03:51:02,870
especially on amateur fights,

8595
03:51:02,871 --> 03:51:05,540
on Indian reservations and things like
that because people will rush that

8596
03:51:05,541 --> 03:51:06,290
fucking Matt,

8597
03:51:06,290 --> 03:51:08,480
you're not going to stop
people from Russia in the map.

8598
03:51:08,990 --> 03:51:11,540
That's the one thing that
saves people in the cage.

8599
03:51:11,840 --> 03:51:13,040
It's like when they rushed the cage,

8600
03:51:13,070 --> 03:51:13,791
it's a whole event.

8601
03:51:13,791 --> 03:51:14,650
It's hard to get to,

8602
03:51:14,670 --> 03:51:16,250
everyone's got to sit in the bleachers,

8603
03:51:16,340 --> 03:51:16,581
you know.

8604
03:51:16,581 --> 03:51:18,140
No one's allowed to sit on the floor.

8605
03:51:18,141 --> 03:51:19,490
Everyone sits on the bleachers.

8606
03:51:19,730 --> 03:51:20,240
Yeah.

8607
03:51:20,240 --> 03:51:20,960
That's your shit.

8608
03:51:20,960 --> 03:51:21,530
There should be,

8609
03:51:21,530 --> 03:51:25,830
it should be difficult to get to the
case or get to the bat area and there

8610
03:51:25,831 --> 03:51:27,420
should be a lot of security.

8611
03:51:27,500 --> 03:51:27,810
Yeah.

8612
03:51:27,810 --> 03:51:31,290
You're going to have to have people
standing by and all these areas also to

8613
03:51:31,291 --> 03:51:33,380
block people to block fighters.

8614
03:51:33,400 --> 03:51:36,390
Keep them from going into the crowd is
going to have to be someone that makes

8615
03:51:36,391 --> 03:51:39,060
like almost like a physical
wall that stops them.

8616
03:51:39,061 --> 03:51:40,350
If someone's bum rushing.

8617
03:51:41,040 --> 03:51:41,873
Yeah,

8618
03:51:42,180 --> 03:51:46,200
but there's got to be like a warning
tracked and you gotta like not,

8619
03:51:46,230 --> 03:51:50,310
you got to respect that warning track
has got to be a big ass area as you get

8620
03:51:50,311 --> 03:51:51,780
into the outside ring.

8621
03:51:51,780 --> 03:51:52,230
Yeah.

8622
03:51:52,230 --> 03:51:53,780
You gotta break Selfie shot.

8623
03:51:53,810 --> 03:51:54,070
Yeah.

8624
03:51:54,070 --> 03:51:56,970
I going to want to go once you
know there's no where to go,

8625
03:51:57,210 --> 03:51:58,260
you're not going to go that way.

8626
03:51:58,440 --> 03:51:59,400
When there's a fence,

8627
03:51:59,470 --> 03:52:00,810
you'd lean on it,

8628
03:52:01,050 --> 03:52:01,890
your pressure him,

8629
03:52:01,950 --> 03:52:03,300
he's leaning on the fence.

8630
03:52:03,450 --> 03:52:04,283
But if it's not there,

8631
03:52:04,310 --> 03:52:05,400
it's not going to do you any good.

8632
03:52:05,610 --> 03:52:06,120
Like if,

8633
03:52:06,120 --> 03:52:06,660
if they,

8634
03:52:06,660 --> 03:52:11,510
if you've got pressed against the fence
and they break it immediately after a

8635
03:52:11,511 --> 03:52:11,761
while,

8636
03:52:11,761 --> 03:52:12,481
people would be like,

8637
03:52:12,481 --> 03:52:14,700
what's the point of pushing
him against the fence?

8638
03:52:14,701 --> 03:52:16,350
And they're going to
break it up in one second.

8639
03:52:16,830 --> 03:52:17,191
You know?

8640
03:52:17,191 --> 03:52:20,110
So then there's not going to be
strategies that involve the fence,

8641
03:52:20,340 --> 03:52:21,600
so it will be no fence.

8642
03:52:21,960 --> 03:52:22,141
No,

8643
03:52:22,141 --> 03:52:22,880
exactly.

8644
03:52:22,880 --> 03:52:25,350
But you could do accomplish
the same thing in a,

8645
03:52:25,351 --> 03:52:25,921
in a ring.

8646
03:52:25,921 --> 03:52:27,600
There's no reason to go on the outside.

8647
03:52:27,660 --> 03:52:28,710
You're going to start looking around.

8648
03:52:28,711 --> 03:52:29,880
It's just like a wrestling match.

8649
03:52:30,040 --> 03:52:31,170
It's like combat sambo.

8650
03:52:31,290 --> 03:52:32,790
They're not trying to get to the outside.

8651
03:52:32,850 --> 03:52:33,180
Yeah.

8652
03:52:33,180 --> 03:52:34,350
You know what you could do,

8653
03:52:34,380 --> 03:52:37,320
you actually could do
some sort of offense,

8654
03:52:37,650 --> 03:52:39,180
but you're not allowed
to go anywhere near it.

8655
03:52:40,210 --> 03:52:41,260
What's going to happen if you touched it?

8656
03:52:41,261 --> 03:52:41,760
You can't do it,

8657
03:52:41,760 --> 03:52:43,750
but you didn't want the fence
because it's all about the visual.

8658
03:52:43,751 --> 03:52:44,041
It's all,

8659
03:52:44,041 --> 03:52:44,910
it's all about the visuals.

8660
03:52:44,911 --> 03:52:45,744
You'll be fine.

8661
03:52:46,020 --> 03:52:46,561
Maybe electric,

8662
03:52:46,561 --> 03:52:47,220
basketball,

8663
03:52:47,220 --> 03:52:48,900
maybe like one of them
things or a dog collar.

8664
03:52:49,250 --> 03:52:50,520
You don't want to do
you step out of bounds.

8665
03:52:50,530 --> 03:52:51,510
I think I get to a free shot.

8666
03:52:51,570 --> 03:52:52,920
You ever seen an electric fences?

8667
03:52:52,921 --> 03:52:55,620
The dogs have where they get to
a certain part that gets zapped.

8668
03:52:56,380 --> 03:52:57,780
You set up the stakes in the ground.

8669
03:52:57,781 --> 03:53:00,810
It's like a radio frequency and when
it gets to a certain point and the dog

8670
03:53:00,811 --> 03:53:01,740
passes that line,

8671
03:53:01,741 --> 03:53:05,850
you know it's about if you take someone
and you push someone out of bounds,

8672
03:53:06,000 --> 03:53:06,833
your opponent,

8673
03:53:07,440 --> 03:53:09,990
they stop it and that guy
gets on your back blooming.

8674
03:53:09,990 --> 03:53:10,650
It started from there.

8675
03:53:10,650 --> 03:53:14,910
Could you imagine if you were front row
and you saw Travis Brown and Derrick

8676
03:53:14,910 --> 03:53:18,300
Lewis dog and your way trust someone to
try to defend a take down the other ones

8677
03:53:18,301 --> 03:53:20,550
trying to get it and they're coming
straight towards you and you realize,

8678
03:53:20,551 --> 03:53:21,240
oh my God,

8679
03:53:21,240 --> 03:53:22,980
that guy was blocking is
not going to get two on top.

8680
03:53:22,981 --> 03:53:23,910
I'm going to get crushed.

8681
03:53:24,330 --> 03:53:27,180
And you get crushed by Derrick Lewis
and Travis Brown on top of you.

8682
03:53:28,290 --> 03:53:30,180
You're stupid front row seats now bitch.

8683
03:53:31,500 --> 03:53:32,333
Right?

8684
03:53:32,430 --> 03:53:34,080
Like you ever see that
happen in a basketball game?

8685
03:53:34,530 --> 03:53:37,910
We're dudes falls on Jesus different.

8686
03:53:37,950 --> 03:53:39,150
That's not going to happen in fighting.

8687
03:53:39,450 --> 03:53:40,380
It could easily happen.

8688
03:53:40,381 --> 03:53:43,800
And finally you would have to
have a good amount of space,

8689
03:53:44,070 --> 03:53:45,600
a good amount of space,

8690
03:53:45,960 --> 03:53:48,240
and I wouldn't take the
front row for a fucking bet.

8691
03:53:48,410 --> 03:53:49,243
No,

8692
03:53:50,640 --> 03:53:51,473
I would do.

8693
03:53:51,510 --> 03:53:52,290
Yeah,

8694
03:53:52,290 --> 03:53:53,370
he made it like to the,

8695
03:53:53,371 --> 03:53:55,560
that guy leaped into the
audience and he made,

8696
03:53:55,860 --> 03:53:59,310
the guys will have a little
pads like you know pads.

8697
03:54:00,090 --> 03:54:01,250
Oh my God.

8698
03:54:01,890 --> 03:54:06,310
Nobody's going to be doing that is so
exciting for to save balls from going.

8699
03:54:06,340 --> 03:54:07,320
He's just crowd a bounce.

8700
03:54:07,321 --> 03:54:07,771
That's all.

8701
03:54:07,771 --> 03:54:10,770
But I did fly into those people
and someone could have died.

8702
03:54:11,130 --> 03:54:12,240
He's 400 pounds.

8703
03:54:12,241 --> 03:54:13,140
He's so big.

8704
03:54:13,530 --> 03:54:15,720
If he landed on your hand and talk there,

8705
03:54:16,540 --> 03:54:19,890
no guitar player invest in Atlanta.

8706
03:54:21,200 --> 03:54:24,520
He just smashes all
your fingers like crack,

8707
03:54:24,521 --> 03:54:24,791
crack,

8708
03:54:24,791 --> 03:54:25,800
crack and you're like,

8709
03:54:25,801 --> 03:54:27,180
eh.

8710
03:54:27,490 --> 03:54:28,323
You ever get those?

8711
03:54:28,720 --> 03:54:30,070
You know those disposable chopsticks,

8712
03:54:30,071 --> 03:54:32,050
they give you some Sushi
places and you fucking break.

8713
03:54:32,051 --> 03:54:32,500
I'm wrong.

8714
03:54:32,500 --> 03:54:33,160
Oh God.

8715
03:54:33,160 --> 03:54:36,430
Then he's tried to get clean
to the top and it's dead.

8716
03:54:36,431 --> 03:54:39,940
You got one and three quarters chopsticks
and then one quarter chopstick.

8717
03:54:40,290 --> 03:54:41,200
He just so depressed,

8718
03:54:41,201 --> 03:54:43,770
but just shitty chopsticks trying
to eat you spicy tuna roll.

8719
03:54:45,820 --> 03:54:46,840
What is this guy doing?

8720
03:54:47,440 --> 03:54:49,180
Was another guy flying into the crowd.

8721
03:54:49,210 --> 03:54:51,540
Same with shack with the whole
team gets out of the way here.

8722
03:54:51,640 --> 03:54:52,473
Oh No,

8723
03:54:53,510 --> 03:54:54,580
that's Alaris boy,

8724
03:54:54,581 --> 03:54:55,331
those are athletes.

8725
03:54:55,331 --> 03:54:55,751
Heel Quik.

8726
03:54:55,751 --> 03:54:56,584
They moved.

8727
03:54:56,830 --> 03:54:58,630
When you see Shaq barrel
and down your way,

8728
03:54:59,470 --> 03:55:03,460
I think the front row should be
all security with kicking shields.

8729
03:55:03,790 --> 03:55:07,180
That's not a bad hold the fuck up.

8730
03:55:07,181 --> 03:55:08,020
Your vision you,

8731
03:55:08,021 --> 03:55:10,780
Oh you have him down your chest.

8732
03:55:10,781 --> 03:55:12,820
Some guys who the person
is not going to get to see.

8733
03:55:12,821 --> 03:55:13,360
Exactly.

8734
03:55:13,360 --> 03:55:13,960
So like those,

8735
03:55:13,960 --> 03:55:16,300
those referees and you
can get in those towns.

8736
03:55:18,660 --> 03:55:19,271
I solved it.

8737
03:55:19,271 --> 03:55:22,450
You just have security on the
front row and you want to look bad.

8738
03:55:22,570 --> 03:55:23,403
It might work.

8739
03:55:23,650 --> 03:55:25,360
I think this is probably a way to do it.

8740
03:55:25,390 --> 03:55:25,710
You know,

8741
03:55:25,710 --> 03:55:26,620
had a real good way.

8742
03:55:26,621 --> 03:55:27,400
Honestly.

8743
03:55:27,400 --> 03:55:28,360
Frank Shamrock,

8744
03:55:28,660 --> 03:55:30,790
he had a a recessed arena.

8745
03:55:31,150 --> 03:55:31,971
He had a,

8746
03:55:31,971 --> 03:55:34,930
I remember that he had it set up a
little thing where there was like,

8747
03:55:34,931 --> 03:55:38,290
it was a flat area and towards the end
it kind of went up a little bit like a

8748
03:55:38,420 --> 03:55:38,801
pole.

8749
03:55:38,801 --> 03:55:42,880
Looks like an actual frank,

8750
03:55:42,940 --> 03:55:45,190
frank shamrock fighting arena.

8751
03:55:45,191 --> 03:55:45,941
What did he call it?

8752
03:55:45,941 --> 03:55:46,930
He had a name for it.

8753
03:55:47,390 --> 03:55:48,750
Shoot the shit.

8754
03:55:48,770 --> 03:55:49,280
Yeah,

8755
03:55:49,280 --> 03:55:49,610
yeah,

8756
03:55:49,610 --> 03:55:50,350
yeah,

8757
03:55:50,350 --> 03:55:50,561
yeah.

8758
03:55:50,561 --> 03:55:51,730
Maybe that's what it was.

8759
03:55:52,030 --> 03:55:57,030
Maybe we would just shoot bucks
maybe and then member the Yama Yama.

8760
03:55:57,311 --> 03:55:58,144
That's what it was.

8761
03:55:58,270 --> 03:55:58,661
But no,

8762
03:55:58,661 --> 03:55:59,710
that was afterwards.

8763
03:55:59,711 --> 03:56:01,120
Frank shamrock did it first.

8764
03:56:01,270 --> 03:56:03,010
The Yama thing came afterwards.

8765
03:56:03,040 --> 03:56:03,401
Let me see.

8766
03:56:03,401 --> 03:56:08,110
Frank Shepherd Yama thing was the
guy from the UFC the early days.

8767
03:56:08,780 --> 03:56:10,030
He's river that no,

8768
03:56:10,530 --> 03:56:10,930
no,

8769
03:56:10,930 --> 03:56:11,250
no,

8770
03:56:11,250 --> 03:56:11,870
no,

8771
03:56:11,870 --> 03:56:12,130
no,

8772
03:56:12,130 --> 03:56:12,963
no,

8773
03:56:13,110 --> 03:56:13,943
no.

8774
03:56:14,560 --> 03:56:15,280
Why can I not?

8775
03:56:15,280 --> 03:56:16,700
It's not art Davies.

8776
03:56:17,910 --> 03:56:19,930
The fuck is wrong with my memory lately.

8777
03:56:21,250 --> 03:56:22,180
Campbell Mclaren.

8778
03:56:22,440 --> 03:56:23,273
No,

8779
03:56:23,290 --> 03:56:24,610
the other Guy Art Davey.

8780
03:56:24,790 --> 03:56:24,971
No,

8781
03:56:24,971 --> 03:56:27,520
the other guy got the cash.

8782
03:56:28,630 --> 03:56:29,290
Put it all together.

8783
03:56:29,290 --> 03:56:30,190
How can I not remember his name?

8784
03:56:30,191 --> 03:56:31,024
He's a great guy.

8785
03:56:31,450 --> 03:56:34,740
God my brain shit is this
frank shamrock spot on.

8786
03:56:34,741 --> 03:56:35,530
There we go.

8787
03:56:35,530 --> 03:56:36,363
This show,

8788
03:56:36,760 --> 03:56:39,280
he's got like a little
bit of a raised edge.

8789
03:56:40,890 --> 03:56:45,010
This may be the length Swick he
may have figured it out long ago.

8790
03:56:45,550 --> 03:56:45,731
Well,

8791
03:56:45,731 --> 03:56:47,170
you definitely had a good idea.

8792
03:56:47,410 --> 03:56:51,190
He was right at the fights look like and
that no holds barred movie though too.

8793
03:56:53,210 --> 03:56:53,770
Which one?

8794
03:56:53,770 --> 03:56:54,550
No holds barred.

8795
03:56:54,550 --> 03:56:55,383
This is awesome.

8796
03:56:56,020 --> 03:56:57,550
This is exactly what we're talking about.

8797
03:56:57,730 --> 03:56:58,511
Bob Myerwitz,

8798
03:56:58,511 --> 03:56:59,161
Jesus Christ.

8799
03:56:59,161 --> 03:56:59,340
Mary,

8800
03:56:59,340 --> 03:56:59,550
what's,

8801
03:56:59,550 --> 03:57:00,280
there we go.

8802
03:57:00,280 --> 03:57:00,970
This is it.

8803
03:57:00,970 --> 03:57:01,360
Yeah.

8804
03:57:01,360 --> 03:57:03,950
I mean essentially it's basically
what we're talking about.

8805
03:57:03,980 --> 03:57:04,510
Look,

8806
03:57:04,510 --> 03:57:06,700
because when you get to the edge,

8807
03:57:06,701 --> 03:57:07,330
it goes up,

8808
03:57:07,330 --> 03:57:09,790
it goes up and you know what's going on.

8809
03:57:09,820 --> 03:57:10,840
Everybody knows what's going on.

8810
03:57:10,841 --> 03:57:14,590
I think he could give it a little bit
more and get a little bit more distance.

8811
03:57:14,740 --> 03:57:17,080
I think the center area
could be a little larger,

8812
03:57:17,081 --> 03:57:18,580
but I think essentially nailed it.

8813
03:57:18,640 --> 03:57:18,941
Oh,

8814
03:57:18,941 --> 03:57:19,421
Jesus,

8815
03:57:19,421 --> 03:57:20,254
this is great.

8816
03:57:21,250 --> 03:57:23,570
Oh fuck.

8817
03:57:23,571 --> 03:57:23,781
Yeah,

8818
03:57:23,781 --> 03:57:24,260
it is.

8819
03:57:24,260 --> 03:57:24,830
Hey Dude,

8820
03:57:24,830 --> 03:57:25,430
that's a great,

8821
03:57:25,430 --> 03:57:26,001
you know what?

8822
03:57:26,001 --> 03:57:27,020
He was ahead of his term,

8823
03:57:27,021 --> 03:57:27,854
frank shamrock.

8824
03:57:28,220 --> 03:57:29,790
Shamrock ahead of his time.

8825
03:57:29,800 --> 03:57:30,230
Actually,

8826
03:57:30,230 --> 03:57:31,070
that's the way to do it,

8827
03:57:31,280 --> 03:57:31,930
right?

8828
03:57:31,930 --> 03:57:33,290
Someone's right to invest in that.

8829
03:57:33,291 --> 03:57:34,430
That looks pretty damn cool.

8830
03:57:34,431 --> 03:57:37,270
I think it's going to have the best vas.

8831
03:57:37,300 --> 03:57:38,360
They're all immediately,

8832
03:57:38,420 --> 03:57:42,140
because what are the best seats
at UFC is the risers on the floor,

8833
03:57:42,141 --> 03:57:42,974
the risers.

8834
03:57:43,070 --> 03:57:44,180
Everybody gets a riser.

8835
03:57:44,240 --> 03:57:44,550
Yeah,

8836
03:57:44,550 --> 03:57:45,710
and we see it as a riser.

8837
03:57:46,640 --> 03:57:46,851
Yeah.

8838
03:57:46,851 --> 03:57:47,570
I mean this is,

8839
03:57:47,570 --> 03:57:49,130
this is exactly what you were looking.

8840
03:57:49,160 --> 03:57:49,700
Oh Man.

8841
03:57:49,700 --> 03:57:50,300
Frank,

8842
03:57:50,300 --> 03:57:51,200
Jesus Christ.

8843
03:57:51,290 --> 03:57:52,123
Frank nailed it.

8844
03:57:52,160 --> 03:57:52,993
He nailed it.

8845
03:57:53,060 --> 03:57:54,980
Mike Swick with the
beautiful knock out there.

8846
03:57:55,040 --> 03:57:55,281
Shit.

8847
03:57:55,281 --> 03:57:56,114
Let's see another one.

8848
03:57:56,150 --> 03:57:57,070
Look at this frank.

8849
03:57:57,590 --> 03:58:00,860
Frank would have viewed idea how many
views is it happened and what was it

8850
03:58:00,861 --> 03:58:01,161
called?

8851
03:58:01,161 --> 03:58:01,581
Was it called?

8852
03:58:01,581 --> 03:58:03,380
Chicago has 9,000 views.

8853
03:58:03,410 --> 03:58:03,921
Oh my God.

8854
03:58:03,921 --> 03:58:06,080
It's called shoot box shoe box number one.

8855
03:58:06,230 --> 03:58:08,720
And it says Mike Swick versus
who's the gentleman he fought.

8856
03:58:08,780 --> 03:58:09,560
What does it say?

8857
03:58:09,560 --> 03:58:10,370
Which Bacon?

8858
03:58:10,370 --> 03:58:11,150
Which Bacon?

8859
03:58:11,150 --> 03:58:12,440
My fucking name dude.

8860
03:58:12,441 --> 03:58:13,160
Amazing.

8861
03:58:13,160 --> 03:58:14,930
You should invest in frank shamrock.

8862
03:58:14,931 --> 03:58:19,280
Is that the only video of shoe
box in testing and bacon and shit.

8863
03:58:19,490 --> 03:58:24,490
I'm here to give out advice for people
for free run with it that I'm not,

8864
03:58:24,500 --> 03:58:25,490
I don't want any money.

8865
03:58:25,700 --> 03:58:26,533
Just take my,

8866
03:58:26,930 --> 03:58:31,190
well I think the basketball court
idea is perfect but that's it.

8867
03:58:31,220 --> 03:58:34,310
That's the way to implement it to the
basketball court or if that seems like a

8868
03:58:34,350 --> 03:58:35,111
highschool jammer,

8869
03:58:35,111 --> 03:58:36,980
mass Halco cause that's
risers immediately.

8870
03:58:37,040 --> 03:58:38,540
It's the way to implement it.

8871
03:58:38,570 --> 03:58:41,510
Maybe a little larger move
and it has a metal fence.

8872
03:58:41,650 --> 03:58:42,770
Do you see the metal fence?

8873
03:58:42,771 --> 03:58:44,660
I don't know about that and
I don't like the metal fence.

8874
03:58:44,840 --> 03:58:46,870
Maybe you have like every 10 yards.

8875
03:58:46,880 --> 03:58:48,230
You have a dude with a kicking shield,

8876
03:58:48,320 --> 03:58:48,890
you know what I mean?

8877
03:58:48,890 --> 03:58:50,060
Huddled down in the frogs.

8878
03:58:50,720 --> 03:58:52,400
The frogs dance.

8879
03:58:53,630 --> 03:58:56,480
We need a man to state a
frog stands for seven bouts.

8880
03:58:56,481 --> 03:58:57,770
Can you do it soldier?

8881
03:58:58,700 --> 03:58:59,720
I'm all about the frog stance,

8882
03:58:59,721 --> 03:58:59,961
bro.

8883
03:58:59,961 --> 03:59:01,730
I to back squats against the wall.

8884
03:59:02,270 --> 03:59:07,270
I'm all about the Lotus position and
I double up with the horse dance.

8885
03:59:07,730 --> 03:59:09,080
I have the kicking shield.

8886
03:59:09,740 --> 03:59:11,840
I think it's definitely
better than a cage.

8887
03:59:11,870 --> 03:59:14,180
I think the cage also gives,

8888
03:59:14,570 --> 03:59:18,020
it gives it a weird douchey connotation.

8889
03:59:18,021 --> 03:59:18,530
Right?

8890
03:59:18,530 --> 03:59:19,520
Cage fighting.

8891
03:59:19,521 --> 03:59:20,060
Yes.

8892
03:59:20,060 --> 03:59:23,780
You know it always had that weird sort
of pit bull on a fucking chain with

8893
03:59:23,781 --> 03:59:25,830
spikes coming out of a snack feel to it.

8894
03:59:26,330 --> 03:59:26,960
Yeah,

8895
03:59:26,960 --> 03:59:27,793
yeah,

8896
03:59:27,890 --> 03:59:28,221
yeah.

8897
03:59:28,221 --> 03:59:31,010
It seems like to look
at it for what it would,

8898
03:59:31,011 --> 03:59:34,430
it really is like martial arts
in its purest application.

8899
03:59:34,760 --> 03:59:35,960
You would want no cage.

8900
03:59:35,990 --> 03:59:36,700
Yes,

8901
03:59:36,700 --> 03:59:37,430
I agree.

8902
03:59:37,430 --> 03:59:38,420
Frank shamrock nailed it.

8903
03:59:38,421 --> 03:59:39,254
Ladies and gentlemen.

8904
03:59:39,430 --> 03:59:40,263
Damn.

8905
03:59:40,490 --> 03:59:44,090
All he needs is rash guards and no gloves,

8906
03:59:44,150 --> 03:59:44,930
no gloves,

8907
03:59:44,930 --> 03:59:45,631
rash guards.

8908
03:59:45,631 --> 03:59:47,810
So the rock fought with no gloves.

8909
03:59:47,811 --> 03:59:48,644
He fought,

8910
03:59:48,890 --> 03:59:50,090
he did everything.

8911
03:59:50,091 --> 03:59:51,770
He did all the styles.

8912
03:59:51,771 --> 03:59:54,470
He did Pancrase back when they had slaps.

8913
03:59:54,740 --> 03:59:54,891
Yeah,

8914
03:59:54,891 --> 03:59:57,890
he fought MMA when you
didn't have to wear gloves,

8915
03:59:58,880 --> 04:00:00,110
like when he beat,

8916
04:00:00,650 --> 04:00:04,250
when he became the UFC champion,

8917
04:00:05,630 --> 04:00:06,860
did they have to wear gloves back then?

8918
04:00:06,930 --> 04:00:07,600
Yeah,

8919
04:00:07,600 --> 04:00:08,011
sure.

8920
04:00:08,011 --> 04:00:08,844
For sure.

8921
04:00:09,230 --> 04:00:10,400
Definitely for sure.

8922
04:00:10,580 --> 04:00:12,780
I think 100% when he was fighting,

8923
04:00:12,800 --> 04:00:13,633
he wore gloves

8924
04:00:15,440 --> 04:00:17,500
when he fought Kevin
Jackson arm barred them.

8925
04:00:18,020 --> 04:00:19,250
I don't know about in Japan.

8926
04:00:19,690 --> 04:00:20,640
Didn't know about that.

8927
04:00:20,720 --> 04:00:22,740
I think by them they were wearing gloves,

8928
04:00:22,770 --> 04:00:24,240
which everyone does have a Jackson,

8929
04:00:24,241 --> 04:00:25,170
frank shamrock.

8930
04:00:25,550 --> 04:00:26,640
You have see Japan,

8931
04:00:26,850 --> 04:00:27,900
they were wearing gloves.

8932
04:00:27,901 --> 04:00:31,830
Here's what I definitely know
that in my tenure with the UFC,

8933
04:00:31,831 --> 04:00:34,800
when I started in 1997 you
did not have to wear gloves.

8934
04:00:34,950 --> 04:00:39,950
You could wear shoes and they let like
way smaller people fight way bigger

8935
04:00:40,771 --> 04:00:41,040
piece,

8936
04:00:41,040 --> 04:00:43,320
but when you could still grab cups,

8937
04:00:43,860 --> 04:00:45,630
you can still grab someone's crotch.

8938
04:00:46,560 --> 04:00:50,810
I remember volleyed g the lead Ishmael
fought some Japanese character and has

8939
04:00:50,811 --> 04:00:53,070
got Japanese dude gave
him a Wedgie from hell,

8940
04:00:53,240 --> 04:00:53,650
you will.

8941
04:00:53,650 --> 04:00:57,150
You were allowed to grab shorts and his
shorts were just digging into his ass

8942
04:00:57,151 --> 04:00:57,690
and balls.

8943
04:00:57,690 --> 04:00:58,800
It was horrific.

8944
04:00:59,550 --> 04:01:04,550
It was totally legal back then when he
fought frank shamrock when he fought Dan

8945
04:01:05,100 --> 04:01:06,660
Henderson and I think it was battle Kade,

8946
04:01:06,661 --> 04:01:07,291
I think,

8947
04:01:07,291 --> 04:01:09,270
or one of those weird one off shoots.

8948
04:01:09,490 --> 04:01:11,330
It was frank shamrock toehold,

8949
04:01:11,430 --> 04:01:12,263
Dan Henderson,

8950
04:01:12,720 --> 04:01:14,340
and I don't think they'd
be wearing gloves then.

8951
04:01:14,370 --> 04:01:14,521
No,

8952
04:01:14,521 --> 04:01:15,061
but that was,

8953
04:01:15,061 --> 04:01:15,990
that was a different thing.

8954
04:01:16,570 --> 04:01:18,960
That was an all grappling thing.

8955
04:01:19,170 --> 04:01:20,190
That was all grappling.

8956
04:01:20,430 --> 04:01:20,521
Oh,

8957
04:01:20,521 --> 04:01:21,630
was that was uh,

8958
04:01:21,960 --> 04:01:23,040
Matt Hume

8959
04:01:24,630 --> 04:01:27,000
against an Olympic wrestler
all grappling there were,

8960
04:01:27,670 --> 04:01:27,930
no,

8961
04:01:27,930 --> 04:01:29,190
that one was all grappling.

8962
04:01:29,191 --> 04:01:29,371
Yeah,

8963
04:01:29,371 --> 04:01:30,330
that was all grappling.

8964
04:01:30,600 --> 04:01:33,450
The one you're thinking of with Dan
Harrison versus frank shamrock was all

8965
04:01:33,451 --> 04:01:35,160
grappling and I don't remember,

8966
04:01:35,161 --> 04:01:36,900
it was a pro grappling thing.

8967
04:01:37,030 --> 04:01:37,863
Matthew,

8968
04:01:39,080 --> 04:01:42,000
they were trying to find the best grappler
and then they were trying to find the

8969
04:01:42,001 --> 04:01:46,140
best striker and Dan Gable
did commentary along with,

8970
04:01:46,200 --> 04:01:47,580
I think it was John Perretti,

8971
04:01:47,581 --> 04:01:49,350
I think it was John
Perretti and Dan Gable.

8972
04:01:49,350 --> 04:01:50,580
I might be wrong about Peretti.

8973
04:01:50,940 --> 04:01:52,500
I think it was John Peretti's event.

8974
04:01:52,740 --> 04:01:53,573
In fact,

8975
04:01:53,820 --> 04:01:55,970
think about what happens in battle Cade.

8976
04:01:55,971 --> 04:01:56,520
No,

8977
04:01:56,520 --> 04:01:56,731
no.

8978
04:01:56,731 --> 04:01:57,870
He did that as well.

8979
04:01:57,990 --> 04:02:00,870
But I think he had already left that
by the time I think it was called the

8980
04:02:00,871 --> 04:02:01,860
contenders.

8981
04:02:03,030 --> 04:02:06,880
I think it was a submission grappling
event only that was called the contender.

8982
04:02:06,890 --> 04:02:08,620
See if I made all that shit up.

8983
04:02:08,740 --> 04:02:09,573
I don't think

8984
04:02:11,590 --> 04:02:12,780
I'm 100% positive number.

8985
04:02:12,790 --> 04:02:15,660
It was at the same show where Eric Paulson
had long hair and he was getting his

8986
04:02:15,780 --> 04:02:16,613
hair pulled.

8987
04:02:16,980 --> 04:02:18,270
Don't think that's the same show.

8988
04:02:18,300 --> 04:02:19,770
And the guy in mezcal
was pulling his hair.

8989
04:02:19,790 --> 04:02:20,200
Yes.

8990
04:02:20,200 --> 04:02:21,270
That was a different thing.

8991
04:02:21,630 --> 04:02:22,560
That was a different thing.

8992
04:02:22,590 --> 04:02:22,990
Oh No.

8993
04:02:22,990 --> 04:02:25,110
Oh Eric Paulson against um,

8994
04:02:25,170 --> 04:02:27,270
a black kickboxer Chi
or the are black box.

8995
04:02:27,271 --> 04:02:28,081
And I remember that.

8996
04:02:28,081 --> 04:02:28,980
Which show was that?

8997
04:02:29,580 --> 04:02:29,851
Boy,

8998
04:02:29,851 --> 04:02:30,241
I don't know.

8999
04:02:30,241 --> 04:02:30,691
That was like,

9000
04:02:30,691 --> 04:02:31,980
we're bart veil fought.

9001
04:02:31,980 --> 04:02:33,660
Didn't Bart veil fight on that card?

9002
04:02:33,661 --> 04:02:34,610
Member Barn Vale.

9003
04:02:34,800 --> 04:02:36,480
But we fought.

9004
04:02:36,481 --> 04:02:39,150
The dude was on a model
Hawaiian bone breaking style.

9005
04:02:39,151 --> 04:02:39,781
That was his style.

9006
04:02:39,781 --> 04:02:42,090
Remember that dude's it
have like crazy style,

9007
04:02:42,091 --> 04:02:47,091
serious history and then may history
so many non UFC shows that went on that

9008
04:02:49,660 --> 04:02:50,630
just disappeared.

9009
04:02:50,670 --> 04:02:51,380
They just couldn't.

9010
04:02:51,380 --> 04:02:55,470
So docs then boy and frank
shamrock beat Tito Ortiz.

9011
04:02:55,500 --> 04:02:56,700
Holy Shit.

9012
04:02:57,090 --> 04:02:58,350
That was a crazy fight.

9013
04:02:58,440 --> 04:02:58,740
Yep.

9014
04:02:58,740 --> 04:02:58,861
He's,

9015
04:02:58,861 --> 04:03:02,130
Tito was a gorilla and frank
shamrock has outpaced them.

9016
04:03:02,131 --> 04:03:03,810
Just kept him going and kept him going.

9017
04:03:03,811 --> 04:03:04,441
Warm out,

9018
04:03:04,441 --> 04:03:05,274
kept him going.

9019
04:03:05,610 --> 04:03:07,350
The adventure you just
hand was hammer fist.

9020
04:03:07,590 --> 04:03:08,423
At the end of the fight.

9021
04:03:08,990 --> 04:03:09,930
Tito was just done.

9022
04:03:09,960 --> 04:03:14,100
Me and frank shamrock played Mexican
prison guards in a movie with Mickey

9023
04:03:14,100 --> 04:03:14,933
Rourke.

9024
04:03:15,710 --> 04:03:17,010
We're both Mexican prison.

9025
04:03:17,350 --> 04:03:17,980
Amazing.

9026
04:03:17,980 --> 04:03:21,970
And in in wardrobes that were like
really trying to dirty up our uniform and

9027
04:03:21,971 --> 04:03:23,980
really try to make it
all messed up and dirty.

9028
04:03:24,430 --> 04:03:25,480
That was pretty racist.

9029
04:03:25,481 --> 04:03:26,620
What year was this?

9030
04:03:26,710 --> 04:03:28,680
This was a long eight,

9031
04:03:28,690 --> 04:03:33,010
maybe seven before make
Rourke had that comeback.

9032
04:03:33,190 --> 04:03:34,540
This was before the wrestler?

9033
04:03:34,840 --> 04:03:36,100
This is after the wrestler,

9034
04:03:36,250 --> 04:03:36,750
was it?

9035
04:03:36,750 --> 04:03:37,150
Yeah.

9036
04:03:37,150 --> 04:03:38,290
He made the comeback already.

9037
04:03:38,291 --> 04:03:40,990
This is a movie that if 50 cent was in it,

9038
04:03:41,140 --> 04:03:44,620
it's called 13 the wrestlers
way before 2008 right.

9039
04:03:44,621 --> 04:03:45,454
What was the wrestler?

9040
04:03:45,460 --> 04:03:49,330
I didn't realize how many movies are made
by big name actors that you never know

9041
04:03:49,331 --> 04:03:53,260
about that just they just consider them
failures is letting go that you know,

9042
04:03:53,261 --> 04:03:56,050
there's so many movies that you never see.

9043
04:03:56,051 --> 04:03:58,820
They decided to pull the plug midway
through production or something.

9044
04:03:58,830 --> 04:04:00,790
They just released it on DVD all quietly.

9045
04:04:01,030 --> 04:04:02,410
They didn't tell anybody about it.

9046
04:04:02,580 --> 04:04:02,920
That was,

9047
04:04:02,920 --> 04:04:03,670
I didn't know.

9048
04:04:03,670 --> 04:04:04,930
I thought for sure.

9049
04:04:05,350 --> 04:04:06,183
Uh,

9050
04:04:06,220 --> 04:04:10,660
Mickey Rourke's in it and at 50 cents
in an adjacent stayed them is in it.

9051
04:04:10,690 --> 04:04:11,560
It's called 13.

9052
04:04:11,650 --> 04:04:12,580
I thought it was going to be big.

9053
04:04:13,170 --> 04:04:14,003
Nobody watched it.

9054
04:04:14,550 --> 04:04:15,290
It's submission.

9055
04:04:15,290 --> 04:04:16,123
They buried it.

9056
04:04:16,650 --> 04:04:17,483
Yeah.

9057
04:04:18,450 --> 04:04:19,270
Um,

9058
04:04:19,270 --> 04:04:21,170
so the contenders submission,

9059
04:04:21,171 --> 04:04:22,190
grappling,

9060
04:04:22,880 --> 04:04:24,350
go to all,

9061
04:04:24,351 --> 04:04:25,820
don't look for the intenders.

9062
04:04:25,821 --> 04:04:26,654
That's right.

9063
04:04:26,990 --> 04:04:28,400
I'm pretty sure that was the name of it.

9064
04:04:29,540 --> 04:04:29,811
Yeah.

9065
04:04:29,811 --> 04:04:30,471
What year was that?

9066
04:04:30,471 --> 04:04:31,430
1990 what?

9067
04:04:31,431 --> 04:04:32,570
90 97 Yup.

9068
04:04:32,600 --> 04:04:33,290
That's it.

9069
04:04:33,290 --> 04:04:33,770
That's it.

9070
04:04:33,770 --> 04:04:34,640
It was all grappling.

9071
04:04:34,890 --> 04:04:35,780
All grappling.

9072
04:04:35,810 --> 04:04:36,110
Yup.

9073
04:04:36,110 --> 04:04:37,760
Frank shamrock versus Dan Henderson.

9074
04:04:38,120 --> 04:04:38,953
That's right.

9075
04:04:39,170 --> 04:04:40,580
Kenny Monday versus Matt Hume.

9076
04:04:40,581 --> 04:04:41,121
That's right.

9077
04:04:41,121 --> 04:04:43,370
Another Olympic wrestler
and Matt Hume submitted him.

9078
04:04:44,210 --> 04:04:44,690
Wow.

9079
04:04:44,690 --> 04:04:45,320
That's right.

9080
04:04:45,320 --> 04:04:45,891
Frank shamrock.

9081
04:04:45,891 --> 04:04:46,491
Dan Henderson.

9082
04:04:46,491 --> 04:04:47,051
Can we see that?

9083
04:04:47,051 --> 04:04:47,331
Oh yeah,

9084
04:04:47,331 --> 04:04:48,164
that's online.

9085
04:04:48,290 --> 04:04:49,800
He got them in a toehold.

9086
04:04:49,890 --> 04:04:50,721
They got him in until it,

9087
04:04:50,721 --> 04:04:52,250
but I could've swore,

9088
04:04:52,760 --> 04:04:53,080
I dunno.

9089
04:04:53,080 --> 04:04:54,210
I could have swore I was a regular.

9090
04:04:54,510 --> 04:04:54,890
No,

9091
04:04:54,890 --> 04:04:55,131
no,

9092
04:04:55,131 --> 04:04:55,910
definitely it wasn't.

9093
04:04:55,910 --> 04:04:57,650
I remember it super specific.

9094
04:04:57,680 --> 04:04:58,161
Here we go.

9095
04:04:58,161 --> 04:04:58,994
Full screen.

9096
04:04:59,090 --> 04:04:59,923
Look at this.

9097
04:04:59,960 --> 04:05:00,890
Holy Shit.

9098
04:05:01,580 --> 04:05:03,760
27 years old at the time of Shams,

9099
04:05:03,770 --> 04:05:04,491
Dan Henderson,

9100
04:05:04,491 --> 04:05:06,240
27 Frank Shamrock,

9101
04:05:06,280 --> 04:05:07,340
25.

9102
04:05:07,790 --> 04:05:08,840
Holy Fuck.

9103
04:05:08,920 --> 04:05:09,091
You know,

9104
04:05:09,091 --> 04:05:09,924
it's really crazy.

9105
04:05:10,130 --> 04:05:10,963
By this time,

9106
04:05:11,060 --> 04:05:13,160
frank shamrock can only been
trained in like seven years.

9107
04:05:13,860 --> 04:05:14,300
Right?

9108
04:05:14,300 --> 04:05:15,021
Seven years.

9109
04:05:15,021 --> 04:05:15,710
That's a long time.

9110
04:05:15,710 --> 04:05:17,120
He started when he was like 18 years old,

9111
04:05:17,121 --> 04:05:17,690
didn't he?

9112
04:05:17,690 --> 04:05:19,160
Didn't he start don't have gloves.

9113
04:05:19,190 --> 04:05:20,023
Yeah.

9114
04:05:20,390 --> 04:05:20,631
No,

9115
04:05:20,631 --> 04:05:21,470
this is not a fight,

9116
04:05:21,471 --> 04:05:21,711
dude.

9117
04:05:21,711 --> 04:05:22,700
This is a grappling match.

9118
04:05:22,730 --> 04:05:23,840
100% cause look,

9119
04:05:23,841 --> 04:05:24,970
Dan Henderson weren't shoes.

9120
04:05:24,971 --> 04:05:25,700
Yeah,

9121
04:05:25,700 --> 04:05:27,980
1997 but 1997 again,

9122
04:05:28,080 --> 04:05:31,730
she could wear shoes in the
UFC and you have to work ups.

9123
04:05:32,270 --> 04:05:37,040
Trade tellig men fought Vitor Belfort in
vittores debut and Trey Talbmen did not

9124
04:05:37,041 --> 04:05:37,874
have gloves on.

9125
04:05:39,070 --> 04:05:40,130
I'm almost positive.

9126
04:05:41,120 --> 04:05:41,953
Look at this.

9127
04:05:42,920 --> 04:05:43,820
And Scott for Rosa,

9128
04:05:43,821 --> 04:05:44,870
he was another guy in the tournament.

9129
04:05:44,871 --> 04:05:45,690
He had gloves on.

9130
04:05:45,690 --> 04:05:48,950
I totally forgot all about
it being a grappling match.

9131
04:05:48,980 --> 04:05:49,550
Yeah,

9132
04:05:49,550 --> 04:05:51,170
well it's a long time ago man.

9133
04:05:51,440 --> 04:05:52,191
And um,

9134
04:05:52,191 --> 04:05:54,390
Dan Gable did commentary
and let me hear the,

9135
04:05:54,391 --> 04:05:57,650
of the volume on the commentary so
we could figure out who look at that.

9136
04:05:57,651 --> 04:05:58,161
Bam.

9137
04:05:58,161 --> 04:05:58,550
He jumped.

9138
04:05:58,550 --> 04:05:59,710
He jumped back for that leg lock.

9139
04:05:59,720 --> 04:06:01,490
That's Peretti of course he's got,

9140
04:06:01,600 --> 04:06:01,780
yeah,

9141
04:06:01,780 --> 04:06:02,613
it's John Perretti.

9142
04:06:03,110 --> 04:06:03,860
John Perretti,

9143
04:06:03,860 --> 04:06:06,530
one of the most underappreciated
commentators of all time.

9144
04:06:07,220 --> 04:06:07,550
Look at it.

9145
04:06:07,550 --> 04:06:08,560
And he's got some seriously,

9146
04:06:09,130 --> 04:06:11,810
look at that bad and he's gone

9147
04:06:13,940 --> 04:06:14,900
and look with the heel.

9148
04:06:16,130 --> 04:06:16,930
What's that?

9149
04:06:16,930 --> 04:06:19,100
What's the issue is where it
hits a toehold right here.

9150
04:06:19,130 --> 04:06:19,521
Yeah,

9151
04:06:19,521 --> 04:06:19,940
man.

9152
04:06:19,940 --> 04:06:21,110
Especially with that shoe.

9153
04:06:21,860 --> 04:06:23,270
Or it could be a heel hook.

9154
04:06:23,430 --> 04:06:23,850
Whereas yeah,

9155
04:06:23,850 --> 04:06:26,420
that's a heel hook kilo.

9156
04:06:26,421 --> 04:06:27,254
It was a heel hook.

9157
04:06:27,260 --> 04:06:28,250
Damn.

9158
04:06:28,280 --> 04:06:28,551
Damn.

9159
04:06:28,551 --> 04:06:29,330
That was nasty.

9160
04:06:29,330 --> 04:06:29,730
Yeah.

9161
04:06:29,730 --> 04:06:33,350
That looks like high level
leg lock you in for them.

9162
04:06:33,440 --> 04:06:36,140
It did do French homework was a beast.

9163
04:06:36,800 --> 04:06:37,471
He was a beast.

9164
04:06:37,471 --> 04:06:38,960
You went after that lag.

9165
04:06:39,740 --> 04:06:40,573
Wow.

9166
04:06:41,480 --> 04:06:44,890
That's a gem right there that
just got resurrected that,

9167
04:06:44,900 --> 04:06:45,201
I mean,

9168
04:06:45,201 --> 04:06:46,630
he follows his leg up.

9169
04:06:46,910 --> 04:06:48,370
He fucked his leg up.

9170
04:06:48,400 --> 04:06:49,700
Let's see what happens when he stands up.

9171
04:06:50,830 --> 04:06:51,261
Oh yeah,

9172
04:06:51,261 --> 04:06:51,561
man.

9173
04:06:51,561 --> 04:06:52,640
His leg is fucked up.

9174
04:06:53,210 --> 04:06:54,800
And especially with those heels,

9175
04:06:55,310 --> 04:06:55,761
with the,

9176
04:06:55,761 --> 04:06:55,911
uh,

9177
04:06:55,911 --> 04:06:58,420
the shoes on heel hooks
with wrestling shoes on.

9178
04:06:58,950 --> 04:07:00,240
He was like a talk.

9179
04:07:00,241 --> 04:07:01,100
That thing in there,

9180
04:07:01,101 --> 04:07:02,090
it's not going nowhere.

9181
04:07:02,120 --> 04:07:05,400
Frank shamrock versus Allen goes crazy.

9182
04:07:05,850 --> 04:07:08,330
Pancrase those crazy rules that if you,

9183
04:07:08,540 --> 04:07:10,690
if your cotton and anything on the ground,

9184
04:07:10,700 --> 04:07:11,480
you're in trouble.

9185
04:07:11,480 --> 04:07:14,810
You could grab the rope and
you have to restart grabbing.

9186
04:07:14,811 --> 04:07:16,310
The girls get to restarts.

9187
04:07:16,490 --> 04:07:17,780
That's the dumbest shit ever.

9188
04:07:18,440 --> 04:07:19,360
This is beautiful.

9189
04:07:19,790 --> 04:07:20,230
Who?

9190
04:07:20,230 --> 04:07:20,720
Who's this?

9191
04:07:20,720 --> 04:07:21,700
A frank shamrock again.

9192
04:07:21,950 --> 04:07:22,783
Yeah.

9193
04:07:23,200 --> 04:07:23,330
Yeah.

9194
04:07:23,330 --> 04:07:24,650
This is high level stuff right here.

9195
04:07:24,680 --> 04:07:25,513
Yeah.

9196
04:07:26,510 --> 04:07:28,730
Go to Matt Hume versus Kenny Monday.

9197
04:07:28,731 --> 04:07:31,720
See if you could find that Matt
Hume versus Kenny Monday was,

9198
04:07:31,830 --> 04:07:32,750
isn't it amazing?

9199
04:07:32,751 --> 04:07:33,570
What's online?

9200
04:07:33,570 --> 04:07:34,280
Seriously.

9201
04:07:34,280 --> 04:07:34,821
So much cool.

9202
04:07:34,821 --> 04:07:35,780
Shit's crazy.

9203
04:07:35,781 --> 04:07:37,070
You never called caution records.

9204
04:07:37,880 --> 04:07:41,270
It's a strange time for
being able to view things,

9205
04:07:41,990 --> 04:07:42,830
but it does happen.

9206
04:07:42,890 --> 04:07:43,490
Look at that.

9207
04:07:43,490 --> 04:07:44,323
Bam.

9208
04:07:44,810 --> 04:07:45,643
Go full scale.

9209
04:07:45,870 --> 04:07:46,703
Boom.

9210
04:07:46,750 --> 04:07:47,431
Ba Ba boom.

9211
04:07:47,431 --> 04:07:48,660
He's the fucking ring announcer.

9212
04:07:48,680 --> 04:07:49,610
This is insane,

9213
04:07:49,640 --> 04:07:50,060
dude.

9214
04:07:50,060 --> 04:07:50,600
Come on.

9215
04:07:50,600 --> 04:07:51,230
Wow.

9216
04:07:51,230 --> 04:07:52,063
Again,

9217
04:07:52,100 --> 04:07:54,980
people forget how fucking
good Matt Hume was.

9218
04:07:55,100 --> 04:07:55,940
People Forget.

9219
04:07:56,360 --> 04:07:59,750
There's a reason why Dimitris mighty
mouse Johnson is the pound for pound best

9220
04:07:59,751 --> 04:08:00,620
fighter in the world.

9221
04:08:01,160 --> 04:08:03,380
A big part of it is this
guy's fucking brain.

9222
04:08:03,800 --> 04:08:04,670
Fuck yeah.

9223
04:08:05,000 --> 04:08:07,550
This guy knows a whole lot about fighting.

9224
04:08:08,330 --> 04:08:11,270
He's so high level in so
many different things.

9225
04:08:11,520 --> 04:08:12,353
Sure.

9226
04:08:12,690 --> 04:08:15,000
James available digitally.

9227
04:08:15,220 --> 04:08:18,100
Well does Kenny Monday was
a serious wrestler too.

9228
04:08:18,910 --> 04:08:22,150
He just didn't know what
to do with Matt human.

9229
04:08:22,420 --> 04:08:24,760
Matt Hume I think gets him in a toe hold.

9230
04:08:24,761 --> 04:08:26,140
I think that's where I got confused.

9231
04:08:26,141 --> 04:08:27,310
What's the format here?

9232
04:08:27,311 --> 04:08:28,144
How do you,

9233
04:08:28,500 --> 04:08:29,750
what's a good question?

9234
04:08:29,950 --> 04:08:31,060
What if there's no submission?

9235
04:08:31,330 --> 04:08:32,110
That's a good question.

9236
04:08:32,110 --> 04:08:33,730
I don't remember what the rule set was.

9237
04:08:35,030 --> 04:08:35,863
Okay.

9238
04:08:35,990 --> 04:08:37,520
I do not remember how they set it up.

9239
04:08:37,521 --> 04:08:38,870
It's a circular cage though.

9240
04:08:41,690 --> 04:08:42,081
Yeah.

9241
04:08:42,081 --> 04:08:44,810
See Kenny Mondays on top.

9242
04:08:45,100 --> 04:08:45,933
Oh look it

9243
04:08:47,400 --> 04:08:48,230
up.

9244
04:08:48,230 --> 04:08:50,430
It fucked up cause he
had absolutely no idea.

9245
04:08:50,530 --> 04:08:54,440
He went for it and he gave it
up and he's got the toe down.

9246
04:08:54,680 --> 04:08:55,700
And what is he going to do here?

9247
04:08:55,740 --> 04:08:56,390
Cold.

9248
04:08:56,390 --> 04:08:56,690
Yup.

9249
04:08:56,690 --> 04:08:57,050
Yup.

9250
04:08:57,050 --> 04:08:57,883
Right there.

9251
04:08:58,060 --> 04:08:58,310
Oh,

9252
04:08:58,310 --> 04:08:59,030
he got him.

9253
04:08:59,030 --> 04:08:59,690
Yup.

9254
04:08:59,690 --> 04:09:00,523
So that's where I,

9255
04:09:00,820 --> 04:09:01,760
I confused it.

9256
04:09:01,850 --> 04:09:02,720
Ooh Man.

9257
04:09:03,100 --> 04:09:05,240
Think about that in that show.

9258
04:09:05,420 --> 04:09:07,790
That was 1997 you know,

9259
04:09:07,791 --> 04:09:08,624
we got this big,

9260
04:09:08,780 --> 04:09:09,230
you know,

9261
04:09:09,230 --> 04:09:11,390
leg lock revolution going on right now.

9262
04:09:11,560 --> 04:09:12,000
Yeah.

9263
04:09:12,000 --> 04:09:14,380
But that was basically
the first metamorris

9264
04:09:14,380 --> 04:09:16,230
star style Ebi style,

9265
04:09:16,231 --> 04:09:17,940
all grappling shells.

9266
04:09:18,240 --> 04:09:19,940
I can't believe I forgot about that.

9267
04:09:19,941 --> 04:09:20,774
John Perretti.

9268
04:09:20,880 --> 04:09:21,660
Wow.

9269
04:09:21,660 --> 04:09:22,200
John.

9270
04:09:22,200 --> 04:09:22,920
And you know what?

9271
04:09:22,920 --> 04:09:27,240
We had two high level leg
locks displayed in 1997.

9272
04:09:27,270 --> 04:09:28,080
Incredible.

9273
04:09:28,080 --> 04:09:28,913
Right.

9274
04:09:28,950 --> 04:09:30,030
It's like opening up an old,

9275
04:09:30,031 --> 04:09:34,500
it's like opening up an old judo book
from the 1920s and seen it all blocked

9276
04:09:34,501 --> 04:09:34,860
off.

9277
04:09:34,860 --> 04:09:35,251
You're like,

9278
04:09:35,251 --> 04:09:35,880
what?

9279
04:09:35,880 --> 04:09:39,720
I thought the Brazilians made
up an Omoplata and you're
like those old Japanese

9280
04:09:39,721 --> 04:09:40,201
judo books,

9281
04:09:40,201 --> 04:09:42,240
you realize that it's
all been done before.

9282
04:09:42,290 --> 04:09:42,720
Yeah.

9283
04:09:42,720 --> 04:09:44,580
Well it is kind of incredible.

9284
04:09:44,850 --> 04:09:47,850
It is kind of incredible when you
go back and get to watch that.

9285
04:09:48,690 --> 04:09:50,220
We've seen some nutty shit man.

9286
04:09:50,340 --> 04:09:51,061
We really have.

9287
04:09:51,061 --> 04:09:53,430
We've seen martial arts just evolved.

9288
04:09:53,490 --> 04:09:55,650
What about Hickson's grappling show?

9289
04:09:55,651 --> 04:09:56,484
Remember that?

9290
04:09:56,940 --> 04:09:58,830
And I think this was 2007,

9291
04:09:59,550 --> 04:10:00,383
what was it called?

9292
04:10:00,720 --> 04:10:01,640
It was called Bushido.

9293
04:10:01,770 --> 04:10:01,970
Oh,

9294
04:10:01,970 --> 04:10:02,480
that's right.

9295
04:10:02,480 --> 04:10:02,850
Yep.

9296
04:10:02,850 --> 04:10:04,890
And you were a gay if you want it to.

9297
04:10:04,890 --> 04:10:05,310
He had some,

9298
04:10:05,310 --> 04:10:06,750
I think there were some
Gnocchi matches too.

9299
04:10:06,751 --> 04:10:08,220
I think Shinya Yogi thought on that.

9300
04:10:08,221 --> 04:10:11,610
Marcello Garcia found on that one show
bricks and he could've kept that going.

9301
04:10:12,360 --> 04:10:13,530
And then there was um,

9302
04:10:14,040 --> 04:10:18,030
a Rico chip rally had a show and it
was called the professional submission

9303
04:10:18,031 --> 04:10:18,330
league.

9304
04:10:18,330 --> 04:10:19,260
I think it was PSL.

9305
04:10:19,290 --> 04:10:19,560
No,

9306
04:10:19,560 --> 04:10:23,760
it was a dam professionals submission,

9307
04:10:24,500 --> 04:10:25,051
I think.

9308
04:10:25,051 --> 04:10:27,240
And that's when Jack
Ray fought Randy coture.

9309
04:10:27,860 --> 04:10:28,170
Yeah.

9310
04:10:28,170 --> 04:10:29,010
That was a good one.

9311
04:10:29,040 --> 04:10:33,540
Marcella Garcia fought Jake shields
and Cameron Earl on that one girl.

9312
04:10:33,541 --> 04:10:34,171
That's right.

9313
04:10:34,171 --> 04:10:36,670
Remember that Cameron are off on
the Hixson one two didn't eat.

9314
04:10:36,690 --> 04:10:39,480
Jeff Glover fought Hobson Maura and that,

9315
04:10:39,520 --> 04:10:39,900
uh,

9316
04:10:39,900 --> 04:10:41,880
answers to be weighing five crone.

9317
04:10:41,890 --> 04:10:42,723
Gracie.

9318
04:10:43,350 --> 04:10:44,070
You know,

9319
04:10:44,070 --> 04:10:47,910
there was a lot of all
grappling folks shows wow.

9320
04:10:47,911 --> 04:10:49,620
For this era,

9321
04:10:49,650 --> 04:10:49,920
you know,

9322
04:10:49,920 --> 04:10:50,580
and you know what,

9323
04:10:50,580 --> 04:10:51,720
you know what they all have in common,

9324
04:10:52,170 --> 04:10:53,160
all of them failed.

9325
04:10:53,280 --> 04:10:53,940
You know what I mean?

9326
04:10:53,940 --> 04:10:54,330
We're not,

9327
04:10:54,330 --> 04:10:55,320
that's why I'm not like,

9328
04:10:55,321 --> 04:10:55,441
you know,

9329
04:10:55,441 --> 04:10:55,741
people say,

9330
04:10:55,741 --> 04:10:56,101
dude,

9331
04:10:56,101 --> 04:10:58,050
he'd be guys doing so well my listen,

9332
04:10:58,051 --> 04:10:58,490
there's no,

9333
04:10:58,490 --> 04:11:00,960
it's not like there's a pile
of money than anybody's making.

9334
04:11:01,080 --> 04:11:04,190
We're going to show to show
trying to survive know,

9335
04:11:04,650 --> 04:11:05,640
fight pass.

9336
04:11:05,800 --> 04:11:06,660
That's giant.

9337
04:11:06,690 --> 04:11:07,470
Yeah.

9338
04:11:07,470 --> 04:11:08,303
So can you tell us?

9339
04:11:08,330 --> 04:11:08,451
Yeah,

9340
04:11:08,451 --> 04:11:08,580
no,

9341
04:11:08,580 --> 04:11:09,320
you had a meeting.

9342
04:11:09,320 --> 04:11:09,480
Yeah.

9343
04:11:09,480 --> 04:11:10,710
That's UFC fight pass.

9344
04:11:10,711 --> 04:11:11,370
Like what?

9345
04:11:11,370 --> 04:11:12,203
He tells us

9346
04:11:13,770 --> 04:11:16,380
a ubi 10 Ebi 10 was in December.

9347
04:11:16,410 --> 04:11:20,400
And that show was when GL
Martinez beat Eddie Cummings.

9348
04:11:20,401 --> 04:11:23,460
And that was so huge on
a few different levels.

9349
04:11:23,461 --> 04:11:27,810
I mean the Danaher death squad has been
dominating and they've been dominating

9350
04:11:27,811 --> 04:11:28,051
us.

9351
04:11:28,051 --> 04:11:33,051
They've been beat tapping us out in
Ebi over and over and the fact that Glb

9352
04:11:34,780 --> 04:11:35,070
Eddie Cummings,

9353
04:11:35,070 --> 04:11:38,220
Eddie Collins is the best leg
locker that's ever lived ever.

9354
04:11:38,400 --> 04:11:39,570
Nobody's as good as that.

9355
04:11:39,580 --> 04:11:40,620
He coming with a leg lock,

9356
04:11:40,621 --> 04:11:41,520
there's nobody out there.

9357
04:11:41,520 --> 04:11:42,353
He's the best.

9358
04:11:42,540 --> 04:11:47,540
And for Geo to serve vive in all his
leg locks for like seven minutes,

9359
04:11:47,821 --> 04:11:48,391
six minutes,

9360
04:11:48,391 --> 04:11:49,224
something like that.

9361
04:11:49,530 --> 04:11:52,650
Eddie Cummins was all over his legs deep,

9362
04:11:52,800 --> 04:11:54,500
deep as deep as he wanted.

9363
04:11:54,830 --> 04:11:55,920
Geo was stuck.

9364
04:11:55,921 --> 04:11:57,030
Cause like if I tried to get out of it,

9365
04:11:57,031 --> 04:12:02,031
most people are trying to get out when
Eddie Cummings bites deep and you know if

9366
04:12:02,161 --> 04:12:03,210
you can nip it in the bud,

9367
04:12:03,211 --> 04:12:03,481
yeah,

9368
04:12:03,481 --> 04:12:04,500
you want your attractions,

9369
04:12:04,501 --> 04:12:05,161
you want to get it out,

9370
04:12:05,161 --> 04:12:06,660
you want to nip that shit in the bud.

9371
04:12:06,870 --> 04:12:09,750
But if they get in deep and
you try to get out right,

9372
04:12:09,840 --> 04:12:10,591
right then and there,

9373
04:12:10,591 --> 04:12:13,390
sometimes it's good but
sometimes it's not the best idea.

9374
04:12:13,391 --> 04:12:16,390
Sometimes like if you're caught in the
arm bar or like the arm bar position and

9375
04:12:16,391 --> 04:12:17,860
you're defending your arm right now,

9376
04:12:17,861 --> 04:12:18,940
might not be the best time.

9377
04:12:19,090 --> 04:12:19,960
Let's be patient.

9378
04:12:20,020 --> 04:12:21,160
Let's get a little position.

9379
04:12:21,310 --> 04:12:22,210
Let's set this up.

9380
04:12:22,270 --> 04:12:23,560
Let's wait for the right timing.

9381
04:12:23,770 --> 04:12:25,240
You have to have patience and timing.

9382
04:12:25,600 --> 04:12:26,111
And you know,

9383
04:12:26,111 --> 04:12:27,100
geo survived.

9384
04:12:27,370 --> 04:12:27,821
And then,

9385
04:12:27,821 --> 04:12:28,150
uh,

9386
04:12:28,150 --> 04:12:30,700
Eddie Cummins jumped on his back and
he survived that and they went into

9387
04:12:30,701 --> 04:12:33,490
overtime and Geo bidding
beat them in overtime and,

9388
04:12:33,730 --> 04:12:35,800
and because of their dominance and B,

9389
04:12:35,830 --> 04:12:39,040
because how vicious Eddie
Cummins is with those leg locks.

9390
04:12:39,041 --> 04:12:42,580
It was a ginormous win
for 10 planner for Geo.

9391
04:12:42,581 --> 04:12:43,660
And for me it was,

9392
04:12:43,661 --> 04:12:44,440
it was,

9393
04:12:44,440 --> 04:12:44,831
it was,

9394
04:12:44,831 --> 04:12:45,280
uh,

9395
04:12:45,280 --> 04:12:48,460
the most epic match in Tennessee.

9396
04:12:48,490 --> 04:12:49,280
Plan of history.

9397
04:12:49,280 --> 04:12:49,760
No doubt.

9398
04:12:49,760 --> 04:12:50,593
That one right there.

9399
04:12:50,710 --> 04:12:51,351
Just tell everybody.

9400
04:12:51,351 --> 04:12:52,190
There's another one.

9401
04:12:52,191 --> 04:12:53,480
It's going to be March 4th,

9402
04:12:54,290 --> 04:12:55,123
March 5th,

9403
04:12:55,350 --> 04:12:57,590
after Tony to the March 4th UFC

9404
04:12:57,840 --> 04:12:58,261
every night.

9405
04:12:58,261 --> 04:13:01,720
Tony Ferguson Against Khabib Woodley,

9406
04:13:02,130 --> 04:13:02,640
uh,

9407
04:13:02,640 --> 04:13:03,360
Thompson.

9408
04:13:03,360 --> 04:13:04,260
And then the next day,

9409
04:13:04,261 --> 04:13:04,910
boom,

9410
04:13:04,910 --> 04:13:05,743
the bi,

9411
04:13:05,840 --> 04:13:07,700
the Walton white UFC fight pass.

9412
04:13:07,730 --> 04:13:09,530
If you have a apple TV,

9413
04:13:09,531 --> 04:13:11,660
you can get UFC fight pass on apple TV.

9414
04:13:11,661 --> 04:13:12,500
That's how I watch it.

9415
04:13:12,501 --> 04:13:13,100
It's dope.

9416
04:13:13,100 --> 04:13:14,690
Watch it on a big screen TV.

9417
04:13:14,691 --> 04:13:15,410
It's awesome.

9418
04:13:15,410 --> 04:13:16,580
There's plus UFC fight pass.

9419
04:13:16,581 --> 04:13:19,260
Just tell everybody has
fucking every fight like every,

9420
04:13:20,510 --> 04:13:21,440
if you're a fight fan,

9421
04:13:21,470 --> 04:13:22,970
it's the greatest resource ever.

9422
04:13:23,090 --> 04:13:24,260
Everything's in HD.

9423
04:13:24,261 --> 04:13:27,230
Everything's there like pretty
much every fight from pride.

9424
04:13:27,231 --> 04:13:29,430
Every fight from the UFC thing.

9425
04:13:29,660 --> 04:13:30,770
If it's not every fight,

9426
04:13:30,771 --> 04:13:31,940
it's pretty much shit.

9427
04:13:32,090 --> 04:13:32,923
Most of them,

9428
04:13:33,550 --> 04:13:34,630
which ones are not fighter.

9429
04:13:34,631 --> 04:13:38,450
He's just to research opponents
passed on the TV network.

9430
04:13:38,570 --> 04:13:39,291
I love,

9431
04:13:39,291 --> 04:13:40,560
I love being on fight pass.

9432
04:13:40,600 --> 04:13:41,121
That's awesome.

9433
04:13:41,121 --> 04:13:41,780
Now man,

9434
04:13:41,780 --> 04:13:42,860
it's awesome now.

9435
04:13:42,861 --> 04:13:43,820
I mean five passes,

9436
04:13:44,030 --> 04:13:47,660
they've got millions of subscribers now
and it's just blowing up for the UFC.

9437
04:13:47,661 --> 04:13:49,910
It was a risky endeavor like to start

9438
04:13:50,790 --> 04:13:51,090
flex.

9439
04:13:51,090 --> 04:13:51,430
Look,

9440
04:13:51,430 --> 04:13:52,890
that's the future and to,

9441
04:13:52,891 --> 04:13:53,940
so your question,

9442
04:13:54,240 --> 04:13:58,050
Ebi 10 was such a hit with the
reviews and the numbers fight.

9443
04:13:58,080 --> 04:14:01,870
The guys from fight pass contacted me
and I went out and had a meeting and they

9444
04:14:01,980 --> 04:14:04,830
told me they were really impressed with
the numbers and they want to get behind

9445
04:14:04,831 --> 04:14:07,620
Ebi even more so we've
been going back and forth.

9446
04:14:07,621 --> 04:14:08,640
I have another meeting with them.

9447
04:14:08,730 --> 04:14:10,350
We want to do something really big,

9448
04:14:10,380 --> 04:14:11,750
but we just got to work things out.

9449
04:14:11,760 --> 04:14:16,760
We want to go just fucking destroy
with like a just a big giant show.

9450
04:14:17,371 --> 04:14:18,150
But yeah,

9451
04:14:18,150 --> 04:14:18,860
talk about it.

9452
04:14:18,860 --> 04:14:19,940
Well you don't have to talk about it,

9453
04:14:19,941 --> 04:14:21,770
but I just tell everybody
has never seen it.

9454
04:14:21,771 --> 04:14:22,604
You figured it out.

9455
04:14:22,730 --> 04:14:23,660
Fast rule sets.

9456
04:14:24,100 --> 04:14:25,550
It's so exciting to watch.

9457
04:14:25,980 --> 04:14:26,870
It makes grappling,

9458
04:14:26,871 --> 04:14:28,130
especially submission grappling.

9459
04:14:28,131 --> 04:14:31,700
And you give it a a finish in a lot
of fights and you put people in bad

9460
04:14:31,701 --> 04:14:33,260
situations and it's just awesome.

9461
04:14:33,620 --> 04:14:36,350
And you're seeing like the level of
grappling is coming out of there.

9462
04:14:36,351 --> 04:14:37,460
It's so exciting.

9463
04:14:37,550 --> 04:14:38,260
It's incredible.

9464
04:14:38,260 --> 04:14:39,350
It's so fun to watch.

9465
04:14:39,351 --> 04:14:41,530
It's so good for not just Jujitsu,

9466
04:14:41,540 --> 04:14:41,810
it's,

9467
04:14:41,810 --> 04:14:44,750
I think it's the best thing to ever
happen for competitive Jujitsu.

9468
04:14:44,900 --> 04:14:45,440
I think your rule,

9469
04:14:45,440 --> 04:14:46,251
your rule systems,

9470
04:14:46,251 --> 04:14:49,190
the best thing that happened and the
fact that it's blowing up on fight pass.

9471
04:14:49,400 --> 04:14:51,830
But I also think anytime
we're seeing any of these,

9472
04:14:51,920 --> 04:14:53,510
all of these different organizations,

9473
04:14:53,810 --> 04:14:55,200
like even the one with the geese were,

9474
04:14:55,210 --> 04:14:55,520
you know,

9475
04:14:55,520 --> 04:14:58,970
Gary Thompson tone and fought
a j for all those things.

9476
04:14:58,970 --> 04:15:01,370
And Chael Sonnen thing
sug good for everybody.

9477
04:15:01,420 --> 04:15:01,850
Yeah.

9478
04:15:01,850 --> 04:15:04,460
Everybody including MMA giant Polaris.

9479
04:15:04,490 --> 04:15:05,180
Yeah.

9480
04:15:05,180 --> 04:15:06,110
Just like glory.

9481
04:15:06,170 --> 04:15:07,190
I think it's good for MMS.

9482
04:15:07,380 --> 04:15:08,213
Hopefully.

9483
04:15:09,050 --> 04:15:10,670
Good for MMA or kickboxing.

9484
04:15:10,671 --> 04:15:10,760
Yeah.

9485
04:15:10,760 --> 04:15:11,151
Good for him.

9486
04:15:11,151 --> 04:15:13,640
And may even in Beltour for the UFC.

9487
04:15:13,641 --> 04:15:13,970
Yeah.

9488
04:15:13,970 --> 04:15:14,481
All of it.

9489
04:15:14,481 --> 04:15:15,200
Good for everything,

9490
04:15:15,200 --> 04:15:15,470
right?

9491
04:15:15,470 --> 04:15:15,710
Yeah,

9492
04:15:15,710 --> 04:15:16,543
absolutely.

9493
04:15:16,790 --> 04:15:17,623
Absolutely.

9494
04:15:17,690 --> 04:15:18,523
Positive.

9495
04:15:18,580 --> 04:15:19,110
Dammit,

9496
04:15:19,110 --> 04:15:19,943
mother fuckers.

9497
04:15:20,140 --> 04:15:20,720
All right.

9498
04:15:20,720 --> 04:15:21,230
That's it.

9499
04:15:21,230 --> 04:15:25,220
Let's wrap this bitch up and did
like four hours and by and change,

9500
04:15:25,430 --> 04:15:25,780
right.

9501
04:15:25,780 --> 04:15:26,100
Thanks.

9502
04:15:26,100 --> 04:15:27,230
That four hours I'm going to be,

9503

American American animals.
