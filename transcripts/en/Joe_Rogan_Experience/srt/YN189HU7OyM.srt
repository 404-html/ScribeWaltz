1
00:00:01,050 --> 00:00:03,000
Hello Freak bitches.

2
00:00:03,150 --> 00:00:03,660
So here,

3
00:00:03,660 --> 00:00:06,330
here we have a natural disaster
happening in our own country.

4
00:00:06,810 --> 00:00:07,290
You know,

5
00:00:07,290 --> 00:00:08,460
barreling in,

6
00:00:08,730 --> 00:00:13,230
nobody at burning man knows about it
because there's no cell phone service back

7
00:00:13,231 --> 00:00:17,940
in 2007 it's barreling
in and a 2005 rather.

8
00:00:18,540 --> 00:00:20,370
And we watch it coming in.

9
00:00:20,940 --> 00:00:21,360
Now the,

10
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:23,310
the amazing thing was we sought,

11
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:28,640
you could watch a video for more bit on
this screen on this guy's screen and you

12
00:00:29,071 --> 00:00:33,480
could watch people walking
down like we saw levy breach,

13
00:00:33,990 --> 00:00:36,690
the first levy breach in like
the ninth ward or something.

14
00:00:37,110 --> 00:00:40,110
We saw that on the screen from
plot from our camp at burning man.

15
00:00:40,170 --> 00:00:42,200
So when you say you took over satellites,

16
00:00:42,201 --> 00:00:43,620
satellites that are broadcasting,

17
00:00:43,621 --> 00:00:43,951
what is it?

18
00:00:43,951 --> 00:00:47,820
Broadcasting media like it was high Rez.

19
00:00:47,821 --> 00:00:49,770
No Hi-Rez reconnaissance imagery.

20
00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:50,131
Okay,

21
00:00:50,131 --> 00:00:54,240
so it's a satellite that is like one
of those spying on bad guy satellites.

22
00:00:54,270 --> 00:00:55,080
Exactly.

23
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:55,913
Whoa.

24
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:56,850
Yeah.

25
00:00:56,850 --> 00:00:57,210
Eat,

26
00:00:57,210 --> 00:00:58,080
we couldn't read.

27
00:00:58,380 --> 00:01:00,540
You gotta talk about this Ad.

28
00:01:02,030 --> 00:01:03,300
If someone finds out about that,

29
00:01:03,301 --> 00:01:04,440
is that like is this an issue?

30
00:01:04,980 --> 00:01:05,880
I don't think so.

31
00:01:05,881 --> 00:01:10,881
I mean not like something that
would be really frowned upon.

32
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:12,601
Well,

33
00:01:12,601 --> 00:01:12,771
the,

34
00:01:12,771 --> 00:01:13,604
the phone,

35
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:15,780
the iridium phone kept ringing.

36
00:01:16,350 --> 00:01:16,681
Yeah.

37
00:01:16,681 --> 00:01:17,760
It's like your dad's calling,

38
00:01:17,761 --> 00:01:18,511
you're having a party.

39
00:01:18,511 --> 00:01:20,010
The neighbors are calling your dad going,

40
00:01:20,011 --> 00:01:20,844
hey man,

41
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:21,151
uh,

42
00:01:21,151 --> 00:01:22,320
I don't know what your son's doing,

43
00:01:22,321 --> 00:01:22,620
but uh,

44
00:01:22,620 --> 00:01:23,520
the lights are on,

45
00:01:23,521 --> 00:01:26,580
there's a million people on your front
lawn and the phone just keeps ringing and

46
00:01:26,581 --> 00:01:26,910
you're like,

47
00:01:26,910 --> 00:01:27,540
ah,

48
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:29,760
but these guys knew who
they're dealing with.

49
00:01:29,761 --> 00:01:34,410
This is this innovative genius type
guy that is totally respected and

50
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:35,291
organization.

51
00:01:35,291 --> 00:01:40,050
So the general that initiated
the inquiry was covering for him.

52
00:01:40,260 --> 00:01:40,351
Oh,

53
00:01:40,351 --> 00:01:40,710
I see.

54
00:01:40,710 --> 00:01:43,350
So the general could then
contact space command and say,

55
00:01:43,351 --> 00:01:44,550
I can't get any information.

56
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:45,631
Oh,

57
00:01:45,631 --> 00:01:45,931
okay.

58
00:01:45,931 --> 00:01:46,410
Okay.

59
00:01:46,410 --> 00:01:47,243
So I see.

60
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:52,500
He had put the satellite in some
kind of a failsafe fallback mode.

61
00:01:53,070 --> 00:01:55,770
So they would spend the next several
days trying to get back into it.

62
00:01:55,980 --> 00:01:56,813
Whoa.

63
00:01:57,080 --> 00:01:57,913
He was just like,

64
00:01:58,110 --> 00:01:59,830
we kept passing it and keep me out,

65
00:01:59,850 --> 00:02:02,040
burn hydrazine and locate,

66
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:02,761
you know,

67
00:02:02,761 --> 00:02:04,110
stuff on the Playa.

68
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:04,921
Wow.

69
00:02:04,921 --> 00:02:06,000
So how would,

70
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:08,160
tell me all the details,

71
00:02:08,161 --> 00:02:09,150
but he's at basically,

72
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:10,500
don't you know,

73
00:02:10,650 --> 00:02:11,483
I'm doing this,

74
00:02:12,030 --> 00:02:13,460
nobody was interested in me.

75
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:14,351
What do you want to hear?

76
00:02:14,351 --> 00:02:15,670
Songs about me being miserable.

77
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:16,833
Yeah.

78
00:02:16,980 --> 00:02:18,100
I would have the day,

79
00:02:18,101 --> 00:02:18,531
man.

80
00:02:18,531 --> 00:02:21,180
I was a grand old time and,

81
00:02:21,181 --> 00:02:21,640
uh,

82
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:22,480
reveling in,

83
00:02:22,540 --> 00:02:23,373
in,

84
00:02:23,870 --> 00:02:24,940
in everything I had,

85
00:02:24,941 --> 00:02:25,570
you know,

86
00:02:25,570 --> 00:02:28,900
I grew up wanting a playboy playmate,

87
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:29,561
you know,

88
00:02:29,561 --> 00:02:30,394
I wanted,

89
00:02:31,390 --> 00:02:31,931
I got all,

90
00:02:31,931 --> 00:02:32,171
you know,

91
00:02:32,171 --> 00:02:33,220
I got all that stuff.

92
00:02:33,221 --> 00:02:33,820
It was,

93
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:34,750
and it was terrific.

94
00:02:34,990 --> 00:02:38,920
The great thing about having things is
it gives you a chance to see whether you

95
00:02:38,921 --> 00:02:39,754
really want it,

96
00:02:40,450 --> 00:02:41,283
you know?

97
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:41,861
And that,

98
00:02:41,861 --> 00:02:42,310
that's,

99
00:02:42,310 --> 00:02:43,150
that's pretty cool.

100
00:02:43,151 --> 00:02:44,440
People spend their lives,

101
00:02:44,830 --> 00:02:45,400
um,

102
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:47,410
sometimes chasing things
that they never get.

103
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:48,640
I've been very fortunate.

104
00:02:48,820 --> 00:02:52,320
I've pretty much gotten everything
I chased and some of it,

105
00:02:52,750 --> 00:02:54,370
it was all worth having,

106
00:02:54,910 --> 00:02:56,440
but it wasn't all worth keeping.

107
00:02:57,610 --> 00:03:01,000
So what you thought it
would before you got there,

108
00:03:01,140 --> 00:03:01,880
why did,

109
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:05,980
sometimes I thought that certain things
would be the solution and only white

110
00:03:05,981 --> 00:03:06,700
playmate.

111
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:07,071
Yeah.

112
00:03:07,071 --> 00:03:07,361
I mean,

113
00:03:07,361 --> 00:03:09,070
it wasn't done for Thursday.

114
00:03:09,071 --> 00:03:09,940
It was a solution.

115
00:03:10,770 --> 00:03:11,603
Um,

116
00:03:12,340 --> 00:03:13,173
but um,

117
00:03:13,330 --> 00:03:13,631
you know,

118
00:03:13,631 --> 00:03:13,930
look,

119
00:03:13,930 --> 00:03:14,111
uh,

120
00:03:14,111 --> 00:03:14,950
again,

121
00:03:16,150 --> 00:03:17,710
my life's been awesome,

122
00:03:18,010 --> 00:03:18,700
awesome.

123
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:19,091
And,

124
00:03:19,091 --> 00:03:19,924
um,

125
00:03:20,020 --> 00:03:21,670
it got me to here and,

126
00:03:21,671 --> 00:03:22,504
uh,

127
00:03:22,870 --> 00:03:23,170
you know,

128
00:03:23,170 --> 00:03:24,610
when you hear poor me,

129
00:03:24,611 --> 00:03:24,830
you know,

130
00:03:24,830 --> 00:03:25,870
when you hear people talking,

131
00:03:25,871 --> 00:03:26,321
poor me,

132
00:03:26,321 --> 00:03:28,210
it's a lonely and you know,

133
00:03:29,210 --> 00:03:29,650
it,

134
00:03:29,650 --> 00:03:31,000
my life's been great.

135
00:03:31,340 --> 00:03:32,020
Um,

136
00:03:32,020 --> 00:03:33,820
and it's all led me to where I am now.

137
00:03:34,030 --> 00:03:34,361
And,

138
00:03:34,361 --> 00:03:35,194
uh,

139
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:36,450
I,

140
00:03:36,450 --> 00:03:38,890
I have nothing but great
memories and no regrets.

141
00:03:39,010 --> 00:03:40,930
So you don't have to go
to therapy at all anymore.

142
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:41,793
You don't do any of that.

143
00:03:41,830 --> 00:03:42,370
I go,

144
00:03:42,370 --> 00:03:44,050
I go sometimes once I,

145
00:03:44,530 --> 00:03:45,071
if I can,

146
00:03:45,071 --> 00:03:45,910
I go once a week,

147
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:46,870
once a week.

148
00:03:46,870 --> 00:03:47,230
Yeah.

149
00:03:47,230 --> 00:03:48,580
As I said to me,

150
00:03:48,790 --> 00:03:50,410
it's not laying on a couch and,

151
00:03:50,411 --> 00:03:51,550
and you know,

152
00:03:51,790 --> 00:03:52,271
trying to,

153
00:03:52,271 --> 00:03:55,330
trying to figure out a minutia.

154
00:03:55,870 --> 00:03:57,380
It's really a great if,

155
00:03:57,530 --> 00:03:58,750
if you have a great therapist,

156
00:03:58,751 --> 00:03:59,740
it's great conversation.

157
00:03:59,890 --> 00:04:00,723
Literally,

158
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:01,240
Hey,

159
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:02,073
here's what I did.

160
00:04:02,350 --> 00:04:04,450
I did this this week and you know,

161
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:06,340
it's,

162
00:04:06,341 --> 00:04:06,790
um,

163
00:04:06,790 --> 00:04:07,870
I call it life school.

164
00:04:08,230 --> 00:04:09,070
It's just kind of,

165
00:04:09,370 --> 00:04:10,203
you know,

166
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:14,990
I don't expect somebody else
to be able to tell me what,

167
00:04:15,010 --> 00:04:16,060
what the answer is.

168
00:04:16,420 --> 00:04:18,370
They probably don't have
the answer for them.

169
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:19,833
You know when,

170
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:24,920
when we put therapists or doctors that
when we put anybody on a pedestal where

171
00:04:24,921 --> 00:04:26,200
we're on dangerous ground,

172
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:27,550
these are just people,

173
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:28,930
they have their own issues.

174
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:31,690
They may be great at helping you,

175
00:04:31,691 --> 00:04:34,690
but it doesn't mean that they
have the answer for them.

176
00:04:35,050 --> 00:04:35,441
We're all,

177
00:04:35,441 --> 00:04:37,570
we're all out there
trying to figure it out.

178
00:04:37,990 --> 00:04:38,823
Them too.

179
00:04:40,450 --> 00:04:41,283
I'm like,

180
00:04:41,550 --> 00:04:42,001
no one's like,

181
00:04:42,001 --> 00:04:42,990
diets aren't going to work.

182
00:04:42,991 --> 00:04:43,520
Right,

183
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:43,741
right.

184
00:04:43,741 --> 00:04:45,120
This has to be a lifestyle change,

185
00:04:45,150 --> 00:04:45,261
right?

186
00:04:45,261 --> 00:04:48,000
Like you can't like go for three
months eating salads and then be like,

187
00:04:48,001 --> 00:04:48,690
Hey,

188
00:04:48,690 --> 00:04:49,590
I got my weight down,

189
00:04:49,591 --> 00:04:53,290
I got my cholesterol down and got my
diabetes down and then going back to it.

190
00:04:53,291 --> 00:04:54,600
It's like you have to have,

191
00:04:54,870 --> 00:04:55,470
but I'm like,

192
00:04:55,470 --> 00:04:56,520
but I love food.

193
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:59,460
Like I love eating and so
the thing I'm doing now,

194
00:04:59,580 --> 00:05:00,430
which I put,

195
00:05:00,450 --> 00:05:03,570
didn't put too much research
into his chewing and spitting.

196
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:05,033
There's,

197
00:05:06,090 --> 00:05:07,590
I know guys who did that with meat.

198
00:05:07,890 --> 00:05:10,860
There's some MMA fighters like Diego
Sanchez was doing that for a while.

199
00:05:10,861 --> 00:05:11,581
He wouldn't eat meat.

200
00:05:11,581 --> 00:05:12,450
He would just chew it up.

201
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:13,490
It's horrible for you.

202
00:05:13,950 --> 00:05:14,371
Is it really?

203
00:05:14,371 --> 00:05:16,140
It's horrible for you
because first of all,

204
00:05:16,740 --> 00:05:17,760
so you get like,

205
00:05:17,761 --> 00:05:20,910
so I'll order like three entrees,

206
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,740
I'll get spaghetti fried chicken,

207
00:05:22,770 --> 00:05:23,430
steak,

208
00:05:23,430 --> 00:05:24,210
I'll get pie,

209
00:05:24,210 --> 00:05:25,340
I'll order everything.

210
00:05:25,410 --> 00:05:29,460
It's just like Roman
Times gluttony to the Max.

211
00:05:29,461 --> 00:05:30,294
Right.

212
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:34,080
And I'll have like the worst is if it's
at a nice restaurant cause then they

213
00:05:34,081 --> 00:05:34,914
don't have the,

214
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:38,340
they have like cloth Napkins and I'm like
can you bring some more of those paper

215
00:05:38,341 --> 00:05:39,174
Napkins?

216
00:05:39,210 --> 00:05:41,370
And I'm sitting there and I'm like,

217
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:43,350
and I'm just chewing everything,

218
00:05:43,410 --> 00:05:46,350
getting all the flavor out of
it and then I'm spitting it,

219
00:05:46,351 --> 00:05:47,940
which the mouth,

220
00:05:47,941 --> 00:05:50,010
as soon as it starts
chewing and making saliva,

221
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:53,310
the stomach starts making acid to
prepare for the food co to come down.

222
00:05:53,610 --> 00:05:54,990
But if the food never comes down,

223
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:56,700
there's just like acid in your stomach,

224
00:05:56,990 --> 00:05:57,770
you know?

225
00:05:57,770 --> 00:05:58,101
And,

226
00:05:58,101 --> 00:06:00,440
and also when you eat,

227
00:06:00,470 --> 00:06:04,130
all the sugar already goes into your
like before it hits your stomach,

228
00:06:04,131 --> 00:06:04,520
you know?

229
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:05,353
Yeah.

230
00:06:05,690 --> 00:06:08,840
So I'm eating all this food that like
nice restaurants and chewing it and

231
00:06:08,841 --> 00:06:10,340
spitting it and Napkins and then,

232
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:14,530
and then putting it like on the
plate and the dude's comes sooner.

233
00:06:14,530 --> 00:06:15,110
Is there,

234
00:06:15,110 --> 00:06:16,220
is there something wrong with the meal?

235
00:06:16,221 --> 00:06:16,401
I'm like,

236
00:06:16,401 --> 00:06:16,520
no,

237
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:16,670
no,

238
00:06:16,670 --> 00:06:17,503
it's delicious.

239
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:18,620
It's fucking amazing.

240
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:19,940
And then you know,

241
00:06:20,030 --> 00:06:20,910
you're looking for shortcuts,

242
00:06:20,930 --> 00:06:21,200
bro.

243
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:22,220
I'm looking for shortcuts.

244
00:06:22,580 --> 00:06:23,241
You can't do that.

245
00:06:23,241 --> 00:06:25,010
Why don't you just hire a real trainer?

246
00:06:25,100 --> 00:06:26,180
Not not critter,

247
00:06:26,270 --> 00:06:30,710
but hire someone who's like a real legit
strength and conditioning trainer who's

248
00:06:30,711 --> 00:06:31,730
gonna put you through some stuff.

249
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,470
If you really want to
do something that's fun,

250
00:06:33,650 --> 00:06:34,490
you should or you're fired.

251
00:06:34,550 --> 00:06:35,570
You should take a martial art.

252
00:06:36,110 --> 00:06:36,441
Yeah,

253
00:06:36,441 --> 00:06:36,891
I guess.

254
00:06:36,891 --> 00:06:37,760
I mean you did judo.

255
00:06:38,630 --> 00:06:39,860
I think I need a hot chick.

256
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:41,750
How would that work for the trainer?

257
00:06:41,751 --> 00:06:43,640
Cause then I'll be motivated
and just Kinda wanna fuck her.

258
00:06:44,290 --> 00:06:44,930
Well that's it.

259
00:06:44,930 --> 00:06:45,870
If you can't fucker,

260
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:49,010
you want to bring other girls hotter
around to show her that you can pack them.

261
00:06:49,011 --> 00:06:49,191
Like,

262
00:06:49,191 --> 00:06:50,060
listen bitch,

263
00:06:50,430 --> 00:06:51,350
I could fuck them.

264
00:06:51,351 --> 00:06:52,220
Why can't I fuck you?

265
00:06:52,220 --> 00:06:54,230
And then it will become
some weird ego thing.

266
00:06:54,231 --> 00:06:58,010
And Joe having an eating disorder is
the number one thing that like bond with

267
00:06:58,011 --> 00:06:59,180
hot chicks because they all have one.

268
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:00,561
I'm like,

269
00:07:00,561 --> 00:07:05,561
should I go a anorexic or chewing and
spitting or bulemia and they're like,

270
00:07:05,810 --> 00:07:06,860
well I tried but I'm like,

271
00:07:06,861 --> 00:07:07,694
cool.

272
00:07:08,090 --> 00:07:13,090
It's like all of a sudden like this
super boring dumb girl is like all like,

273
00:07:13,190 --> 00:07:14,023
Oh yes,

274
00:07:14,210 --> 00:07:15,800
but a lot of like crossfit chicks,

275
00:07:15,801 --> 00:07:17,240
they don't have eating disorders.

276
00:07:17,241 --> 00:07:19,360
If you get like a strength
and conditioning type cow,

277
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:20,300
you're right Joe.

278
00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:21,470
I do have boatloads of money.

279
00:07:21,471 --> 00:07:24,010
I got to figure out how not a shortcut.

280
00:07:24,020 --> 00:07:27,320
I just need to figure out
to make not cure cancer,

281
00:07:27,321 --> 00:07:27,921
not cure aids,

282
00:07:27,921 --> 00:07:31,000
some kind of delicious food that
you can eat every day and you that.

283
00:07:31,090 --> 00:07:33,560
It's why this is the thing.

284
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:35,120
The more you suffer,

285
00:07:35,150 --> 00:07:36,770
the more you'll enjoy pleasure.

286
00:07:37,070 --> 00:07:39,140
You are a glutton for pleasure,

287
00:07:39,170 --> 00:07:39,850
my friend,

288
00:07:39,850 --> 00:07:40,521
but you love.

289
00:07:40,521 --> 00:07:41,120
But here,

290
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:41,953
check this out.

291
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:43,020
So my,

292
00:07:43,020 --> 00:07:44,480
my Japanese business partner,

293
00:07:44,750 --> 00:07:45,590
I work with this company.

294
00:07:45,591 --> 00:07:46,280
Good smile.

295
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:47,750
It's not legal in America yet,

296
00:07:47,780 --> 00:07:48,530
but he has,

297
00:07:48,530 --> 00:07:49,221
he smokes,

298
00:07:49,221 --> 00:07:49,641
he drinks,

299
00:07:49,641 --> 00:07:50,474
he eats all this shit.

300
00:07:51,050 --> 00:07:52,580
I don't even know what
this process is called.

301
00:07:52,581 --> 00:07:53,414
You might have heard of it,

302
00:07:53,570 --> 00:07:55,100
but he did once a month.

303
00:07:55,490 --> 00:07:56,540
This is like real rich guy,

304
00:07:56,541 --> 00:07:56,811
shit.

305
00:07:56,811 --> 00:08:00,980
He gets all like a lot of his blood
taken out and then they do shit to it.

306
00:08:01,010 --> 00:08:05,090
Like they make it into super blood and
then he puts it back into them and then

307
00:08:05,630 --> 00:08:06,441
everything goes down.

308
00:08:06,441 --> 00:08:06,950
His,

309
00:08:06,950 --> 00:08:07,520
his,

310
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:08,300
you know,

311
00:08:08,300 --> 00:08:08,781
and I go,

312
00:08:08,781 --> 00:08:09,614
what is that?

313
00:08:10,190 --> 00:08:11,023
It's not,

314
00:08:11,330 --> 00:08:12,350
it's not FDA,

315
00:08:12,351 --> 00:08:13,000
whatever tested.

316
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,120
It's not in America yet.

317
00:08:14,260 --> 00:08:15,093
And so,

318
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:25,120
okay.
