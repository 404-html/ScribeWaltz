1
00:00:03,610 --> 00:00:05,410
Went back,
it was a mess.

2
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:07,060
Ladies and gentlemen,
we uh,

3
00:00:07,090 --> 00:00:09,850
we tried to,
to come back online.

4
00:00:09,880 --> 00:00:11,360
I was trying to put up a,
a,

5
00:00:11,630 --> 00:00:15,550
an image of a me and David Lee Roth and 
a,

6
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:18,790
what the fuck ever.
Firefox crashed on me,

7
00:00:19,660 --> 00:00:22,030
but I was trying to show you the,
the face.

8
00:00:22,370 --> 00:00:23,200
We're all back,
right?

9
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:25,940
Everything's good.
I'm gonna.

10
00:00:25,950 --> 00:00:28,330
Um,
try to unload it through here.

11
00:00:32,450 --> 00:00:35,600
It's liquor also has a nice side desktop
loader you should download sometime.

12
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:37,730
Oh,
just dragged into it.

13
00:00:38,110 --> 00:00:38,780
Oh really?
Yeah.

14
00:00:39,340 --> 00:00:40,740
Okay.
I'll get that shit.

15
00:00:41,380 --> 00:00:46,380
She put the picture up right now.
I think today is the last day of 

16
00:00:47,651 --> 00:00:49,600
Firefox.
Firefox can suck it

17
00:00:50,110 --> 00:00:54,220
if it's gotten bad lately.
Have noticed.

18
00:00:54,221 --> 00:00:59,221
Chrome's been really good.
I've been crashing a fucking lot with 

19
00:00:59,221 --> 00:01:00,790
firefox.
Like why I stop using it.

20
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:04,120
Yeah.
Okay.

21
00:01:04,210 --> 00:01:05,380
We're back.
Ladies and gentlemen,

22
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:07,510
I apologize.
Apologize.

23
00:01:07,660 --> 00:01:10,840
Saved though.
So if you are just coming in now,

24
00:01:11,830 --> 00:01:13,980
the first hour and a half is already 
saying,

25
00:01:14,020 --> 00:01:14,770
oh,
that's annoying,

26
00:01:14,771 --> 00:01:15,640
right?
It's better

27
00:01:15,730 --> 00:01:19,330
if I have a white thing on my screen 
because it acts as a light look.

28
00:01:21,810 --> 00:01:23,350
Oh look,
there's a light on.

29
00:01:23,690 --> 00:01:27,410
But it's not a light,
it's just a little window open.

30
00:01:28,460 --> 00:01:33,380
I'm so clever.
Make it so I can read your shit though.

31
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:36,800
You know,
if you gotta light behind your monitor,

32
00:01:36,801 --> 00:01:39,500
it actually eases your eyes and puts 
less strain on your eyes.

33
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:44,740
Dr Ross,
Dr Oz real Dr Phil.

34
00:01:45,550 --> 00:01:48,980
Yeah,
Firefox does blow your ride.

35
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:54,040
We're using safari right now and all you
fucking silicons that.

36
00:01:54,621 --> 00:01:57,020
Especially the.
All these fucking MCA.

37
00:01:57,190 --> 00:02:00,260
A Ph.
d dot Dot garbage.

38
00:02:00,350 --> 00:02:02,480
Oh,
it's the same guy over and over again.

39
00:02:02,810 --> 00:02:05,090
And Nicole van,
2009.

40
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:07,820
You are dumb.
Okay.

41
00:02:07,821 --> 00:02:10,160
You're dumb.
You're a dumb person.

42
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:14,960
This whole Mac versus pc thing.
What do you give a fuck?

43
00:02:14,990 --> 00:02:17,750
And you're telling me that pcs are 
somehow or another better than Max.

44
00:02:17,870 --> 00:02:18,740
Guess what?
Douchebag.

45
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:20,870
Pcs Get viruses.
Max,

46
00:02:20,871 --> 00:02:21,290
don't.
It's.

47
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:26,320
That's why you bring me one dude who's 
ever had a virus on his fucking Mac one.

48
00:02:29,060 --> 00:02:33,050
I know everyone I know who's had a pc 
except food and chicken.

49
00:02:33,051 --> 00:02:35,090
He claims to have never gotten a virus.
That's a lie.

50
00:02:35,410 --> 00:02:37,970
That's a lie.
Everybody gets viruses on pcs.

51
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,190
Just that alone.
It's better to get a Mac.

52
00:02:40,250 --> 00:02:41,470
Second of all,
Max,

53
00:02:41,471 --> 00:02:43,400
don't fucking crash nearly as much.

54
00:02:43,550 --> 00:02:45,890
This wasn't a Mac problem is a firefox 
problem.

55
00:02:46,010 --> 00:02:47,690
Everything else on the computer work 
fine.

56
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:51,320
That's why I was able to reboot.
Listen,

57
00:02:51,470 --> 00:02:55,490
stop worrying about Mac versus pc.
It's just a goddamn operating system.

58
00:02:56,090 --> 00:02:58,040
It's like the Republicans versus the 
Democrats.

59
00:02:58,250 --> 00:03:03,250
Most of the people on one side or the 
other or just on a fucking team and 

60
00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:03,430
they're simple little brains are stuck 
on that team.

61
00:03:03,610 --> 00:03:06,340
They might not even agree with half the 
shit the Republican say,

62
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:08,350
but they support them and even say,
well,

63
00:03:08,351 --> 00:03:09,520
we got to support our team.
You know,

64
00:03:09,521 --> 00:03:10,780
I don't agree with they're doing right 
now,

65
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:15,840
but what's important is we support them 
and we know push forward and we get a 

66
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:18,230
Republican office 12,
blah blah,

67
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:23,360
blah.
They're just the Washington redskins 

68
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:23,360
versus the fucking Miami Dolphins.
That's all that shit is.

69
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:26,350
It's teams.
It's just like Boston versus Philly.

70
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:30,250
Philly soaks posted rules.
That's the same ironic bullshit.

71
00:03:30,251 --> 00:03:32,260
All right there.
There is no fucking philly.

72
00:03:32,261 --> 00:03:34,090
There is no Boston.
It's nonsense.

73
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:36,010
You're a dummy.
Shut the fuck up.

74
00:03:36,150 --> 00:03:38,040
All right.
How dare you.

75
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:39,180
Where was I?
Anyway?

76
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:41,140
Did you have to that photo?
Of course I did it.

77
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:42,330
It's not on there.
I dare you.

78
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:46,650
Oh,

79
00:03:47,270 --> 00:03:51,030
I swear to God I pressed that thing.
They all also up quick.

80
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:51,780
It is though.
Oh,

81
00:03:51,830 --> 00:03:54,110
so beautiful.
They just told me that they're upgrading

82
00:03:54,111 --> 00:03:57,170
my download speed,
like 30 megs next month.

83
00:03:57,380 --> 00:03:59,030
My case.
Thanks.

84
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:03,530
I don't even have 20.
I have like I think 16 or 18.

85
00:04:03,531 --> 00:04:08,300
18 inside last time it said 18 to 
picture David Lee Roth

86
00:04:08,430 --> 00:04:09,260
to do too.

87
00:04:15,130 --> 00:04:16,380
Mother fucker.

88
00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:20,650
That's hilarious.

89
00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:25,140
This is what caused all the fucking 
trouble.

90
00:04:25,141 --> 00:04:30,141
Ladies and gentlemen,
a Goddamn picture of me and David Lee 

91
00:04:30,141 --> 00:04:33,650
Roth,
but it was just approved that Brian has 

92
00:04:33,650 --> 00:04:35,691
been making this crazy ba phase for 
years because this picture David Lee 

93
00:04:35,691 --> 00:04:37,620
Roth was like,
what is it like from 2005,

94
00:04:37,940 --> 00:04:42,940
three or four years ago before we got 
banned from the comedy or the whole 

95
00:04:42,940 --> 00:04:42,940
time?
The store thing?

96
00:04:42,940 --> 00:04:43,490
Yeah.
Because it was at the comedy store.

97
00:04:43,491 --> 00:04:46,130
Right.
So that's 2006 maybe.

98
00:04:49,780 --> 00:04:53,360
It was right before he got together with
back together with van Halen before they

99
00:04:53,361 --> 00:04:55,010
announced that they were going to get 
back together.

100
00:04:55,011 --> 00:04:56,410
He was telling us about it though.

101
00:04:56,630 --> 00:04:56,960
Yeah.

102
00:05:03,750 --> 00:05:05,500
All right.
I just put it on my little twitter.

103
00:05:06,190 --> 00:05:08,980
Um,
and then you see Brian in the background

104
00:05:09,070 --> 00:05:14,070
making that crazy face.
He did that your bullshit fucking 

105
00:05:14,070 --> 00:05:18,780
hundreds of thousands of times.
That was a long odyssey just to get one 

106
00:05:18,851 --> 00:05:20,950
picture,
but it really wasn't worth it.

107
00:05:21,550 --> 00:05:25,600
Epic fail indeed deed.
Everybody's always talking about that.

108
00:05:25,601 --> 00:05:29,200
And no key fan got fella tryout,
chat roulette.

109
00:05:29,470 --> 00:05:30,910
You know what I would think about doing 
that.

110
00:05:30,911 --> 00:05:32,150
But I don't want to see any dudes car

111
00:05:32,430 --> 00:05:34,170
randomly.
I did it.

112
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:35,600
I tried it out.
But uh,

113
00:05:35,990 --> 00:05:37,160
uh,
I found this,

114
00:05:37,380 --> 00:05:39,240
this of somebody already did this 
before,

115
00:05:39,241 --> 00:05:44,241
but I found this a big black chick and I
put her on loop and then did it just 

116
00:05:45,781 --> 00:05:50,760
this an recorded the screen and stuff,
but it was like maybe 90 percent Cox and

117
00:05:50,761 --> 00:05:51,180
I was like,
yeah,

118
00:05:51,181 --> 00:05:52,340
it's not even funny.
I don't,

119
00:05:52,380 --> 00:05:56,630
I mean it's really sad that there's so 
many creepy people out there and every,

120
00:05:58,010 --> 00:06:03,010
well,
you know what it's Jews that want to 

121
00:06:03,010 --> 00:06:03,010
show their dicks at work and they just 
never get the opportunity.

122
00:06:03,010 --> 00:06:07,160
But they get at home and they're wearing
a fucking wrestling mask and they go 

123
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:08,220
crazy.
And this just suppression man.

124
00:06:08,221 --> 00:06:10,980
It's like Catholic school girls.
Remember Catholic school girls.

125
00:06:10,981 --> 00:06:12,870
When you were a kid,
there were always the biggest sluts,

126
00:06:12,871 --> 00:06:13,590
right?
Yeah.

127
00:06:13,710 --> 00:06:14,430
Yeah.
Why?

128
00:06:14,460 --> 00:06:19,460
Because they never seen the dick there.
They're whisked away to some fucking 

129
00:06:19,460 --> 00:06:22,530
magical place where only girls exist.
They have all girl teachers and Shit and

130
00:06:22,531 --> 00:06:25,350
they're told the dicks are evil and they
just can't wait to suck one.

131
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:27,030
They can't wait.
Those bitches can't wait.

132
00:06:27,060 --> 00:06:28,650
They can't wait to get up there.
And I'm like,

133
00:06:28,710 --> 00:06:33,710
oh,
I just want to do that for bidding 

134
00:06:33,710 --> 00:06:33,710
thing.
You know,

135
00:06:33,710 --> 00:06:33,710
it can suppress human beings,
man.

136
00:06:33,710 --> 00:06:37,870
I'd like to do it with maybe like a five
year old girl on loop to sitting there 

137
00:06:37,870 --> 00:06:37,870
going like this,
you know,

138
00:06:38,270 --> 00:06:43,270
like that.
And see if any of these guys with the A 

139
00:06:43,270 --> 00:06:43,430
and like put it away or if they sit 
there,

140
00:06:43,650 --> 00:06:48,650
they will fucking love it.
I think what we could record them and 

141
00:06:48,650 --> 00:06:48,650
put them on Youtube,
that's about it.

142
00:06:48,650 --> 00:06:53,561
That's if we get a fake loop of a little
kid just sitting there going like is 

143
00:06:53,561 --> 00:06:57,680
looking at the monitor and see if the 
guy immediately disconnect or if he sits

144
00:06:57,681 --> 00:07:01,260
there an extra couple of seconds.
Well how does it work?

145
00:07:01,310 --> 00:07:03,310
They pull their dicks out immediately as
soon as you log in.

146
00:07:03,311 --> 00:07:03,610
Yeah.
What,

147
00:07:03,630 --> 00:07:06,170
what is right.
It just automatically puts you in with a

148
00:07:06,171 --> 00:07:11,171
room with another person both on Webcam 
and do they have their dick out and 

149
00:07:11,171 --> 00:07:16,110
instantly when I,
when I was doing it was just guys 

150
00:07:16,110 --> 00:07:17,360
stroking or so right when he went in 
there you're like okay,

151
00:07:17,361 --> 00:07:19,040
so that's what you should do.
You should,

152
00:07:19,070 --> 00:07:21,800
we should get a video of like a five or 
six year old girl.

153
00:07:21,890 --> 00:07:23,930
Just freaking the fuck out from the 
beginning.

154
00:07:24,470 --> 00:07:26,230
So it only works in the guys that 
already beat,

155
00:07:26,231 --> 00:07:28,070
not frank,
because otherwise we'd have to time it.

156
00:07:28,100 --> 00:07:29,740
Like Tyler,
like normal,

157
00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:30,380
you know?
And then going,

158
00:07:30,381 --> 00:07:31,630
oh my God.
Yeah,

159
00:07:31,820 --> 00:07:34,010
yeah,
yeah.

160
00:07:34,011 --> 00:07:36,410
And have our screen call the police,
call the police.

161
00:07:36,450 --> 00:07:37,960
We didn't have any debt.
We just had the on,

162
00:07:39,390 --> 00:07:41,130
you know that kind of adult better.
Better.

163
00:07:41,150 --> 00:07:43,620
Just call it freaked this motherfucker 
out.

164
00:07:45,910 --> 00:07:47,940
Yeah,
because they can catch you.

165
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:52,170
The freaky weird dudes are mostly 
straight gay.

166
00:07:52,260 --> 00:07:55,860
Get Sex all the time.
We are less repressed.

167
00:07:56,820 --> 00:07:58,800
Right?
Shut the fuck up.

168
00:07:59,010 --> 00:08:01,200
Let me tell you something.
Everyone's fucked up.

169
00:08:01,201 --> 00:08:06,201
Don't you tell me the days or less 
repressed course you more repressed 

170
00:08:06,201 --> 00:08:10,371
society.
Represses gay sex gays are just as 

171
00:08:10,371 --> 00:08:14,511
fucked up as religion.
Reply repressing straight sex and a lot 

172
00:08:14,511 --> 00:08:18,381
of gays grew up in religious households 
too and that makes them extra fucked up 

173
00:08:18,381 --> 00:08:22,510
there.
It's not like a coincidence that gay 

174
00:08:22,510 --> 00:08:23,520
people do so much crystal meth and 
there's so many gay people that loved to

175
00:08:23,521 --> 00:08:28,200
party and their lives become a reckoning
fucking towards their immune system.

176
00:08:28,380 --> 00:08:33,380
Gay People.
There's a lot of crazy fucking gay 

177
00:08:33,380 --> 00:08:35,421
people and not repressed.
Doesn't always mean that you're not 

178
00:08:35,421 --> 00:08:35,421
fucked up.

179
00:08:35,421 --> 00:08:37,080
I mean,
how about bug chasers?

180
00:08:37,290 --> 00:08:39,660
How about gay dudes that are 
purposefully trying to get aids?

181
00:08:39,730 --> 00:08:42,600
You know that gay dudes who purposely 
try to get HIV,

182
00:08:42,601 --> 00:08:45,870
they want to get it and they think 
there's something hot about it,

183
00:08:45,871 --> 00:08:48,300
and so they go and have unprotected sex 
on purpose,

184
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:52,770
hoping to get HIV.
That's fucked up.

185
00:08:52,860 --> 00:08:55,530
You know,
you can't say that gay people are fucked

186
00:08:55,531 --> 00:09:00,531
up sexually than straight people.
Everyone's fucked humans across the 

187
00:09:00,531 --> 00:09:04,221
board universally are fucked up.
It's just way too difficult to come out 

188
00:09:04,470 --> 00:09:05,910
and have you shared together.
I mean,

189
00:09:05,911 --> 00:09:07,860
how many people really have their shit 
together?

190
00:09:08,370 --> 00:09:13,370
If you had a gas,
the numbers one channel and really has 

191
00:09:13,370 --> 00:09:18,010
no,
but I mean have your shit together to a 

192
00:09:18,010 --> 00:09:18,010
point where you know,
like,

193
00:09:18,010 --> 00:09:18,010
oh,
he's not doing anything.

194
00:09:18,010 --> 00:09:20,880
Self destructive is being productive and
positive.

195
00:09:20,881 --> 00:09:24,690
It's like maybe one out of 100 men maybe
out of the people that you meet.

196
00:09:24,900 --> 00:09:27,060
One out of 100.
The other 99 are nuts.

197
00:09:27,330 --> 00:09:28,530
You know,
half nuts.

198
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:29,760
Partially nods.
You're nuts.

199
00:09:29,761 --> 00:09:31,590
I'm nuts with both nuts.
You know what I mean?

200
00:09:31,591 --> 00:09:36,591
How many.
I mean even the Dalai Lama is fucking 

201
00:09:36,591 --> 00:09:36,591
nuts.
You know what the Dalai Lama said?

202
00:09:36,591 --> 00:09:38,340
He called?
He said that oral and anal sex,

203
00:09:38,370 --> 00:09:39,300
we're,
we're um,

204
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:41,670
I forget,
I forget the exact word turns.

205
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:46,290
He used sexual deviations or something 
like that,

206
00:09:46,410 --> 00:09:51,410
but he was saying,
well I forget the term that the Dalai 

207
00:09:51,410 --> 00:09:54,050
Lama used,
but basically he was saying that oral 

208
00:09:54,050 --> 00:09:54,180
sex is really bad.
It's terrible for you.

209
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:57,660
Didn't do it like you shouldn't be 
putting.

210
00:09:57,960 --> 00:10:01,740
The girls love it.
It feels good and I like doing it.

211
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:02,840
Right.
You like doing.

212
00:10:02,850 --> 00:10:07,850
Yeah,
we've talked about is that there's 

213
00:10:07,850 --> 00:10:07,850
actually,
there's actually science now saying that

214
00:10:07,850 --> 00:10:11,761
it can cause cancer and in the person 
that's eating out the grown out or 

215
00:10:11,761 --> 00:10:11,761
something like that.

216
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:13,850
Are you fucking member?
We talked about this once.

217
00:10:13,860 --> 00:10:15,120
We've talked to science?
No,

218
00:10:15,121 --> 00:10:16,850
we never talked about eating pussy.
Yeah,

219
00:10:16,851 --> 00:10:21,851
we made a video.
We made a video about it where I talked 

220
00:10:21,851 --> 00:10:21,851
about eating pussy and we were talking 
about it in that video,

221
00:10:21,851 --> 00:10:22,740
but we didn't say eating pussy gives 
you.

222
00:10:22,741 --> 00:10:27,741
Yeah,
it was something that came out and we 

223
00:10:27,741 --> 00:10:27,741
were talking about how you like to lock 
out of it,

224
00:10:27,741 --> 00:10:31,731
like a slug.
I know and that's how we started with 

225
00:10:31,731 --> 00:10:33,891
that.
I don't remember eating Pussy Jersey 

226
00:10:33,891 --> 00:10:33,891
cancer.
Dude.

227
00:10:33,891 --> 00:10:36,600
I think he might've just made that up.
No oral sex please.

228
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:38,040
Twitter verse.
Tell me.

229
00:10:38,041 --> 00:10:39,960
Sweet Jesus,
please,

230
00:10:39,990 --> 00:10:43,400
please,
please tell me that you don't get.

231
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:45,090
There was some kind of study that I'm 
eating.

232
00:10:45,370 --> 00:10:50,370
Oral sex increases throat cancer risks.
Serious scientists say no,

233
00:10:50,731 --> 00:10:55,731
that's for girls because due to have 
fucking Dick Ward shoved their dick and 

234
00:10:55,731 --> 00:10:58,680
the girl's mouth and the girl's mouth 
gets infected.

235
00:10:58,860 --> 00:11:01,620
Like if you have the human 
papillomavirus that goes both ways.

236
00:11:02,090 --> 00:11:07,090
Um,
girls and guys can both get the HPV 

237
00:11:07,090 --> 00:11:07,560
virus from eating pussy.
Yeah,

238
00:11:07,990 --> 00:11:12,440
that's chicks because you're mixing up 
with fucking blood in there.

239
00:11:13,140 --> 00:11:18,140
You know,
you might get a clot back there in the 

240
00:11:18,140 --> 00:11:18,140
corner that gets inside of open sore in 
your mouth.

241
00:11:18,140 --> 00:11:19,500
Ever done.
That does sort of make sense.

242
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:22,200
You know,
oral sex can cause throat cancer.

243
00:11:22,350 --> 00:11:24,030
March ninth,
2000.

244
00:11:24,031 --> 00:11:28,590
So it Kinda sucks because that's my 
favorite thing to do.

245
00:11:28,591 --> 00:11:33,591
So I moved on to this.
It's just fuck son,

246
00:11:35,430 --> 00:11:40,430
what's wrong with you?
Boy Tamica here for 43,

247
00:11:42,541 --> 00:11:47,541
but we were down for 10 minutes.
So who's this one dummy?

248
00:11:48,310 --> 00:11:51,120
It keeps saying,
have I ever Shit my pants?

249
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:56,600
You know,
there's something wrong with you as a 

250
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:56,600
human

251
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:59,280
being if you keep asking the same stupid
fucking question over and over and over 

252
00:11:59,471 --> 00:12:00,490
again,
like the same day.

253
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:04,540
That's what's interesting to you.
That's what's interesting to you.

254
00:12:09,890 --> 00:12:11,470
All right,
let's go to war.

255
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:14,250
We're going to go to forums dot Joe 
Rogan.net

256
00:12:14,310 --> 00:12:19,310
and see what the questions are.
We put up a thread like we do it every 

257
00:12:19,310 --> 00:12:21,000
week where

258
00:12:25,580 --> 00:12:26,100
Peter

259
00:12:26,870 --> 00:12:31,740
ask questions and shit.

Well that's almost sold out.

00:12:34,890 --> 00:12:35,810

So Friday is almost sold out late show.
Saturday night is sold out.

a bowl shows Friday inside or both shows

264
00:12:45,691 --> 00:12:48,240

Saturday.

265
00:12:48,241 --> 00:12:49,620
So it.
So now quit.

266
00:12:49,621 --> 00:12:52,680
So if you want to come to Dallas by the

267
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:55,170
when we get on the radio,

268
00:12:55,230 --> 00:12:57,960
We're going to do lex and Terry and a 
couple other radio stations.

269
00:12:57,961 --> 00:13:00,000

271
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:06,300
When are you going to get your tattoo?
A new one.

272
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:11,640
It's going to start in April.
I'm getting into the skinny bitch 

273
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:11,640
thought started.

274
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:14,830
I want to get covered up online.
We're giving you a cap on top of that 

275
00:13:14,830 --> 00:13:15,810

Explosion.

276
00:13:15,811 --> 00:13:16,680
Cat.

277
00:13:16,870 --> 00:13:18,900

I'm going to go and get this lasered 

279
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:23,960
off.
Lasered.

280
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:24,540
Yeah.
This one,

281
00:13:24,541 --> 00:13:26,880
the old one I have up here because I'm 
doing the whole sleeve.

282
00:13:28,310 --> 00:13:30,330
But he'd be laser.
There are no,

283
00:13:30,390 --> 00:13:35,390
you have to go to a clinic that doesn't.
It hurts like a motherfucker but I 

284
00:13:35,390 --> 00:13:35,390
tattoo.
See,

285
00:13:35,390 --> 00:13:35,870
let's say you don't be a pussy.

286
00:13:39,020 --> 00:13:41,560
Yeah.
David did I ever tell them uh,

287
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:42,540
what,
what,

288
00:13:42,570 --> 00:13:45,150
how I found out what my tattoo about 
that whole thing.

289
00:13:45,420 --> 00:13:48,800
Tell us or show the tattoo first.
Tell the whole time.

290
00:13:49,090 --> 00:13:50,770
Okay.
So when I was younger,

291
00:13:50,771 --> 00:13:55,771
I was a manager of a movie theater.
One of my employees wanted to be a 

292
00:13:55,771 --> 00:13:55,771
tattoo artist.
While he tells the story,

293
00:13:55,771 --> 00:13:59,971
I'm going to pay,
one of my employees wanted to be a 

294
00:13:59,971 --> 00:14:01,900
tattoo artist and she,
her boyfriend owned a tattoo studio,

295
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:03,710
so the whole time,
uh,

296
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:04,690
she's like,
you know,

297
00:14:04,691 --> 00:14:09,691
he's teaching me every day how to do 
tattoos and I do it on like watermelons 

298
00:14:09,691 --> 00:14:11,140
or something like that to practice and 
she's been doing it forever.

299
00:14:11,410 --> 00:14:12,820
And finally one day she's like,
you know what,

300
00:14:12,821 --> 00:14:14,290
I'm ready.
Start doing tattoos now.

301
00:14:14,380 --> 00:14:16,060
So if you know anyone that needs a 
tattoo,

302
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:17,980
and she's like,
I'll hook them up.

303
00:14:18,010 --> 00:14:18,880
And I go,
wow,

304
00:14:18,881 --> 00:14:20,110
how much are you charging?
And she's like,

305
00:14:20,111 --> 00:14:21,190
for you,
I'll,

306
00:14:21,250 --> 00:14:26,250
you know,
I'll do it for free or something like 

307
00:14:26,250 --> 00:14:26,380
that because you will be my first person
to ever do it.

308
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:29,200
So I'm like,
thinking free tattoo.

309
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:31,480
That's awesome.
So I went there,

310
00:14:31,481 --> 00:14:35,650
it took her eight hours or something 
ridiculous to do this tattoo.

311
00:14:35,980 --> 00:14:40,980
And it originally was supposed to be an 
Egyptian turtle with a my name in 

312
00:14:42,281 --> 00:14:47,260
Chinese or the letter R in Chinese,
in the middle of the turtle in Chinese.

313
00:14:47,290 --> 00:14:49,480
It was some stupid.
I was really stoned or whatever.

314
00:14:49,930 --> 00:14:53,130
And it hurts so bad she did nothing but 
scar me.

315
00:14:53,310 --> 00:14:56,880
So I have tons of scar tissue and it's 
like the gay is looking.

316
00:14:56,881 --> 00:14:59,430
Tattoo looks like Spiderman,
you know,

317
00:15:00,030 --> 00:15:02,910
within a gang gang fight or something 
like that.

318
00:15:03,180 --> 00:15:04,320
Anyways,
so anyways,

319
00:15:04,690 --> 00:15:09,060
uh,
so one time I met this bar in the,

320
00:15:09,230 --> 00:15:11,710
this Chinese girl both let me see that 
tattoo.

321
00:15:11,790 --> 00:15:13,950
And she goes,
why do you have that on your arms?

322
00:15:14,060 --> 00:15:16,050
She really talk like that.
It was worse than that.

323
00:15:16,051 --> 00:15:17,970
She had a cock in her mouth,
but she,

324
00:15:18,020 --> 00:15:19,650
uh,
she looked at it and she goes,

325
00:15:19,651 --> 00:15:20,520
let me see that.
And she goes,

326
00:15:20,521 --> 00:15:21,930
why do you have that on your arm?
I'm like,

327
00:15:21,931 --> 00:15:23,750
what are you talking about?
That's an orange Chinese,

328
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:24,660
my last name,
blah,

329
00:15:24,661 --> 00:15:25,200
blah,
blah.

330
00:15:25,290 --> 00:15:26,530
She goes,
that's not an rn.

331
00:15:26,540 --> 00:15:28,920
She's,
that's like flowing water.

332
00:15:28,921 --> 00:15:31,170
That's like a waterfall.
Do you like waterfalls?

333
00:15:31,171 --> 00:15:33,790
So I guess my tattoo means water from 
again.

334
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:36,330
So gay.
Anyways,

335
00:15:36,331 --> 00:15:38,520
I was thinking about getting the,
getting the,

336
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:43,600
the.
You know how there's a cats in Chinese 

337
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:43,600
restaurants?
Yeah.

338
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:44,100
They have a clock.
That could be like the clock.

339
00:15:44,290 --> 00:15:47,160
Yes.
I'll have Aaron dove the Dover from grew

340
00:15:47,161 --> 00:15:48,210
tattoo.
We'll do it together.

341
00:15:48,390 --> 00:15:50,880
That'd be awesome.
Or we'll have someone else.

342
00:15:50,881 --> 00:15:53,250
Girl,
they have seven fucking killer artists.

343
00:15:53,340 --> 00:15:55,300
He can recommend.
Somebody will have them drawn.

344
00:15:55,350 --> 00:16:00,350
Honky.
I got my tattoo done at Guru Tattoo in 

345
00:16:00,350 --> 00:16:02,070
San Diego and they're awesome.
Killer artists.

346
00:16:02,190 --> 00:16:02,940
My God.
You got it.

347
00:16:02,950 --> 00:16:06,270
Did me as Aaron Dellavedova and he only 
does big giant pieces.

348
00:16:06,271 --> 00:16:08,820
He did my whole sleeve.
Fifty hours.

349
00:16:09,090 --> 00:16:10,800
We went down there I think seven times.
Right?

350
00:16:11,180 --> 00:16:13,430
But that's going to be the same.
We still do this.

351
00:16:13,550 --> 00:16:15,170
They're going to do.
We're going to do this.

352
00:16:15,171 --> 00:16:16,370
They're too.
We're going to do that again.

353
00:16:16,370 --> 00:16:16,370
And

354
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:17,130
Yeah,
we've got.

355
00:16:17,131 --> 00:16:20,550
So we're gonna do a Brian's uh,
will,

356
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:22,190
will find you a good artist there,
man.

357
00:16:22,220 --> 00:16:25,580
He's got a killer staff of killer 
artists.

358
00:16:25,610 --> 00:16:29,780
Donkey Kong still there because I wear a
shirt every day that he is.

359
00:16:29,870 --> 00:16:31,340
I bet he is.
We could find out.

360
00:16:31,350 --> 00:16:36,350
No gear attack.
When does red band start stripping 

361
00:16:36,350 --> 00:16:40,820
Edward Cat flap all high flaco hello?
Kitty is worse than waterfalls.

362
00:16:41,750 --> 00:16:43,880
It's not the hello kitty man.
How dare you,

363
00:16:43,881 --> 00:16:45,140
Bro?
Hello Kitty.

364
00:16:45,850 --> 00:16:48,050
I didn't think good luck had it.
Didn't take a bump.

365
00:16:48,051 --> 00:16:50,150
I peed.
I've never done a bumper of my life.

366
00:16:50,420 --> 00:16:52,790
It's one of the few drugs that have 
never done.

367
00:16:52,970 --> 00:16:54,170
There's a bunch of them that I've never 
done.

368
00:16:54,171 --> 00:16:57,140
I've never done anything addictive.
There's hockey hung in there in front of

369
00:16:57,590 --> 00:16:59,480
artists.
They had a budget killer artists.

370
00:16:59,481 --> 00:17:00,490
Man,
that place is awesome.

371
00:17:01,190 --> 00:17:02,960
It's in Pacific beach,
down in San Diego.

372
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:03,680
Again.
Still works there.

373
00:17:03,681 --> 00:17:05,000
And I worked on.
I don't think so.

374
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:07,220
I don't think so.
I think that guy lost his marbles.

375
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:09,980
Um.
Anyway.

376
00:17:09,981 --> 00:17:14,981
Well,
what the fuck we're talking about 

377
00:17:14,981 --> 00:17:14,981
tattoos?
No shopping.

378
00:17:14,981 --> 00:17:16,070
Doing cocaine in the bathroom.
I've never done a coke.

379
00:17:16,071 --> 00:17:19,580
I've never done coke any ever because 
when I was in high school,

380
00:17:19,790 --> 00:17:24,790
my friend Jimmy has cousin of selling 
coke shouldn't even send my friend who 

381
00:17:25,190 --> 00:17:27,290
let you fucking gas.
But uh,

382
00:17:27,320 --> 00:17:32,320
he was selling it and um,
when he was doing that he lost all this 

383
00:17:33,261 --> 00:17:38,261
weight and he fucking who would like 
hide in the basement or in the attic 

384
00:17:38,261 --> 00:17:38,261
rather.
And just,

385
00:17:38,261 --> 00:17:39,550
they would do coke and watch TV and him 
and his girlfriend,

386
00:17:39,551 --> 00:17:42,860
which is zombies.
And I saw his whole life fall apart,

387
00:17:42,861 --> 00:17:47,060
like I watched it happen and I remember 
like saying that fucking stuff's bad for

388
00:17:47,061 --> 00:17:52,061
you.
I just remember nothing but bad things 

389
00:17:52,061 --> 00:17:52,240
from high school and,
and you know,

390
00:17:52,260 --> 00:17:54,930
right after high school have people in 
coke just like,

391
00:17:55,130 --> 00:18:00,130
it was very obvious to me.
That was like the worst thing you could 

392
00:18:00,130 --> 00:18:00,130
do.
Nitrous?

393
00:18:00,130 --> 00:18:01,240
No.
Oh,

394
00:18:01,250 --> 00:18:05,970
like from whippets did it once,
once when I worked at a ice cream place,

395
00:18:06,330 --> 00:18:07,620
I didn't like it.
Just give me a headache.

396
00:18:10,020 --> 00:18:11,470
We used to go,
I'm done Mtma.

397
00:18:11,490 --> 00:18:13,770
So they asked me if I done it.
I did ecstasy once,

398
00:18:14,070 --> 00:18:18,330
only one time and it was awesome,
but the next day was so bad.

399
00:18:18,660 --> 00:18:21,570
The next day I was so stupid.
My brain was like,

400
00:18:21,690 --> 00:18:26,690
it felt like a sponge than had been 
wrung out dry and then just left in the 

401
00:18:26,821 --> 00:18:28,440
sun,
you know?

402
00:18:28,740 --> 00:18:30,900
And then you try to like clean something
with it.

403
00:18:30,901 --> 00:18:35,901
It was just like,
it was so my brain was so dumb.

404
00:18:35,970 --> 00:18:37,040
It just,
I,

405
00:18:37,041 --> 00:18:39,780
I was feeling so bad the next day I was 
like,

406
00:18:39,781 --> 00:18:43,410
this cannot be good for you.
It's got to be fucking terrible for you.

407
00:18:43,830 --> 00:18:47,040
Who knows what it was in it though.
It might not have just been mdm,

408
00:18:47,041 --> 00:18:52,041
a pure Mtma.
It might've been like they say that 

409
00:18:52,041 --> 00:18:52,041
people cut it with speed and shit like 
that,

410
00:18:52,041 --> 00:18:53,820
you know?
But anyway,

411
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:59,280
I couldn't read the next day.
That guy read Rehm show gallery.

412
00:18:59,310 --> 00:19:00,750
Rem Shoe Gallery.
Yeah.

413
00:19:00,751 --> 00:19:02,040
I couldn't read the next day,
man.

414
00:19:02,310 --> 00:19:07,310
Literally I was sitting in a starbucks 
and I was trying to read a magazine and 

415
00:19:07,310 --> 00:19:09,030
I was like,
I can't even fucking concentrate on us.

416
00:19:09,300 --> 00:19:11,730
I couldn't literally couldn't focus.
It was.

417
00:19:11,731 --> 00:19:12,700
It was bad.
Know.

418
00:19:12,750 --> 00:19:14,820
It was a fucking great time though.
That night.

419
00:19:14,821 --> 00:19:18,000
I can understand why people do it and I 
guess if you're not a big reader,

420
00:19:18,930 --> 00:19:21,870
you don't mind feeling stupid.
The next day wouldn't be a problem,

421
00:19:21,871 --> 00:19:22,980
but for me,
man,

422
00:19:23,250 --> 00:19:26,120
I've talked to people say there's no the
next day they feel.

423
00:19:26,121 --> 00:19:26,160
Yeah,

424
00:19:26,180 --> 00:19:31,180
fine.
It just depends on how it's like 

425
00:19:31,180 --> 00:19:32,740
strychnine in it and stuff like that.
If you ever candy flipped where it's a 

426
00:19:32,750 --> 00:19:36,900
piece of candy and has ecstasy on one 
side and acid on the other side of her.

427
00:19:36,901 --> 00:19:38,630
That's crazy though.
It's a great combo.

428
00:19:38,820 --> 00:19:39,570
Yeah.
Yeah.

429
00:19:39,710 --> 00:19:42,080
But I've heard it's like whenever you 
combine things like that,

430
00:19:42,081 --> 00:19:45,770
the recovery times just accelerated even
more time.

431
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,180
I want to do it nowadays.

432
00:19:51,260 --> 00:19:53,610
So what else?
What's the best weed?

433
00:19:54,060 --> 00:19:56,100
The best weed is the weed that you got.
Bitch,

434
00:19:56,970 --> 00:19:59,250
you know,
if you don't have the options.

435
00:19:59,320 --> 00:20:04,320
See,
the beautiful thing about California is 

436
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:04,320
this,
um,

437
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:04,920
there,
that guy's fucking deal with that guy,

438
00:20:04,921 --> 00:20:06,840
man.
That's the perfect style.

439
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:10,170
Her style.
I could totally see that guy doing it.

440
00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:13,020
Adam Hawthorne.
Um,

441
00:20:13,021 --> 00:20:13,790
I think,
um,

442
00:20:14,990 --> 00:20:19,990
the thing that's cool about California 
is the fact that you get to go these 

443
00:20:19,990 --> 00:20:23,451
places and experiment with all these 
different strains with Joel Diaz mixes 

444
00:20:23,451 --> 00:20:25,050
it up every day.
He thinks that that's that shit.

445
00:20:25,550 --> 00:20:30,550
Was that right there?
Joey Diaz thinks that tiger looks like,

446
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:37,600
Ooh.
Joey Diaz thinks they should make sure 

447
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:38,100
we meet up every day.
We're on guru tattooed.com

448
00:20:38,260 --> 00:20:40,330
g you are,
you tattoo.

449
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:41,620
Joey

450
00:20:41,620 --> 00:20:43,390
says that if you smoked the same weed 
every day,

451
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:45,760
get used to it,
but if you mix up strains everyday,

452
00:20:45,770 --> 00:20:50,770
the everyday it's like boom.
So Joey buys like a little bit of weed 

453
00:20:50,770 --> 00:20:50,770
every day.
It's like a ritual.

454
00:20:50,770 --> 00:20:55,260
Smoke weed everyday you get used to it.
I mean I have to take a good three days 

455
00:20:55,260 --> 00:20:59,281
off nowadays,
but she always made sure that every day 

456
00:20:59,281 --> 00:21:01,240
I try not to smoke weed everyday.
Joe Ain't taking no days off,

457
00:21:01,740 --> 00:21:06,740
you know,
when you go when we're on the road and 

458
00:21:06,740 --> 00:21:09,320
we'd pass by Joey's hotel room,
like we're all staying in the same 

459
00:21:09,320 --> 00:21:09,320
hotel.
When you go to get joey,

460
00:21:09,320 --> 00:21:13,050
his room stinks of weed.
I mean fucking stinks everyday.

461
00:21:13,060 --> 00:21:18,060
It's thinks a week.
He always knows the right guy in every 

462
00:21:18,060 --> 00:21:18,100
town to get him.
We'd,

463
00:21:18,290 --> 00:21:19,750
you know.
And he always gets it.

464
00:21:20,070 --> 00:21:22,360
Joey's in everyday we'd go,
I own,

465
00:21:22,390 --> 00:21:24,610
I don't smoke weed everyday.
I like to take days off.

466
00:21:25,130 --> 00:21:25,950
I think it,
uh,

467
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:29,010
it's better.
Like I don't like the,

468
00:21:29,020 --> 00:21:32,190
I don't like being completely 
obliterated every day now.

469
00:21:32,191 --> 00:21:33,220
I don't think that's just healthy.

470
00:21:34,530 --> 00:21:37,030
All right,
let's go to the questions on the message

471
00:21:37,031 --> 00:21:39,790
board.
Oh,

472
00:21:39,791 --> 00:21:41,800
you're Charlotte North Carolina.
Date changed.

473
00:21:42,040 --> 00:21:47,040
It changed or a venue changed to did it.
Is it now?

474
00:21:47,171 --> 00:21:52,171
It's a south and a most south end.
Okay.

475
00:22:00,250 --> 00:22:05,250
Whatever.
There were a therefore a UFC.

476
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:08,620
So the way it always works is whenever 
I'm in town for UFC,

477
00:22:08,621 --> 00:22:11,080
I always do a Gig the day before.

478
00:22:12,410 --> 00:22:14,880
Let's go to the message board.
I did a Gig in Sydney,

479
00:22:14,900 --> 00:22:18,070
had a great fucking time.
Australian people are the shit that show

480
00:22:18,071 --> 00:22:19,750
was fun man,
but the show was.

481
00:22:19,940 --> 00:22:22,180
Could,
could have been better because I got too

482
00:22:22,181 --> 00:22:23,560
drunk the night before.
Oh,

483
00:22:23,620 --> 00:22:24,970
we got too drunk.
My brain was,

484
00:22:25,210 --> 00:22:30,210
first of all,
I was fucked up because I could not 

485
00:22:30,210 --> 00:22:30,220
sleep because you're 19 hours ahead when
you go to Australia,

486
00:22:30,340 --> 00:22:31,870
so your body doesn't know what time it 
was.

487
00:22:32,020 --> 00:22:34,870
I'd be exhausted.
I go to sleep three hours later I'd wake

488
00:22:34,871 --> 00:22:37,420
up and I didn't know what I thought I 
was taking a nap.

489
00:22:37,450 --> 00:22:42,450
Like my body had no idea.
I could not sleep for like eight hours 

490
00:22:42,450 --> 00:22:42,450
of the session.
I couldn't do it.

491
00:22:42,450 --> 00:22:43,810
So it sleep like three hours,
get up.

492
00:22:43,811 --> 00:22:46,330
I try to read at beat off.
I tried to go back to sleep again,

493
00:22:46,331 --> 00:22:48,490
that sleep for another hour and I'd wake
up again.

494
00:22:48,490 --> 00:22:51,120
Like it was so confusing that.
But um,

495
00:22:51,850 --> 00:22:54,880
Friday night and we got there.
It was um,

496
00:22:55,330 --> 00:22:58,080
me and uh,
Eddie and um,

497
00:22:58,210 --> 00:22:59,710
who else?
Thompson,

498
00:22:59,710 --> 00:23:00,820
Thompson Guerra.
Me and Eddie and Thompson.

499
00:23:00,821 --> 00:23:05,821
Boy.
We went to a bar and God fucking 

500
00:23:05,821 --> 00:23:06,760
blitzkrieg we just pulled up to the bar.
We,

501
00:23:06,770 --> 00:23:07,270
we,
we,

502
00:23:07,300 --> 00:23:09,070
we set up shop like,
right,

503
00:23:09,100 --> 00:23:12,400
right by the bar at this club and just 
start buying people drinks.

504
00:23:12,500 --> 00:23:17,500
She just went nutty.
I must've bought a hundred fucking 

505
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:20,071
drinks.
Just appointing drinks cheaper or all 

506
00:23:20,071 --> 00:23:20,500
the same?
It's very close.

507
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:23,470
It's like 92,
two.

508
00:23:23,590 --> 00:23:25,110
Our dollar.
A consorted.

509
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:29,300
Ninety two cents or might've been the 
other option might be to.

510
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:31,960
I'm not sure which one,
but uh,

511
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:34,180
people are so.
See any kangaroos anywhere.

512
00:23:34,181 --> 00:23:35,200
Yeah,
we did at the zoo.

513
00:23:35,890 --> 00:23:36,900
Depressed,
depressed.

514
00:23:36,910 --> 00:23:41,910
Kangaroos.
Just laying around like this 

515
00:23:41,910 --> 00:23:43,640
motherfucker.
That's what we were talking about 

516
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:45,451
earlier.
We were talking about the killer whale 

517
00:23:45,451 --> 00:23:45,451
to kill people.

518
00:23:45,451 --> 00:23:45,451
Yeah.
Just a disease.

519
00:23:45,451 --> 00:23:49,820
Bummed me the fuck out man.
I would like to see Kangaroos in the 

520
00:23:49,820 --> 00:23:49,820
wild,
but they're dangerous.

521
00:23:49,820 --> 00:23:53,771
They'll fuck you up.
Was there anything Australia that was 

522
00:23:53,771 --> 00:23:56,081
just completely insane,
like their bathrooms have weird no 

523
00:23:56,081 --> 00:23:56,320
lights and it's like,
you know,

524
00:23:56,390 --> 00:24:01,390
you grow up.
We were talking about this being Eddie 

525
00:24:01,390 --> 00:24:01,390
and Tom about how,
you know,

526
00:24:01,390 --> 00:24:04,571
when you grow up,
you're taught that everything sucks 

527
00:24:04,571 --> 00:24:06,410
except America.
Soccer Australia is the shit.

528
00:24:06,710 --> 00:24:07,970
I mean,
it's beautiful.

529
00:24:07,971 --> 00:24:10,940
It's clean.
Really Nice houses everywhere.

530
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,940
The restaurants were great,
the people were friendly,

531
00:24:14,050 --> 00:24:16,190
you know,
the economy's not completely fucked.

532
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:18,110
You're driving on the left side of the 
road,

533
00:24:18,111 --> 00:24:20,790
which is weird.
But other than that you can use that.

534
00:24:20,900 --> 00:24:21,820
What's the difference?
You know,

535
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:24,410
it's just what you're used to.
But other than that,

536
00:24:24,470 --> 00:24:26,000
it's fucking phenomenal.
I mean,

537
00:24:26,030 --> 00:24:28,580
other than that,
what a great country man.

538
00:24:28,610 --> 00:24:29,750
I mean,
it's amazing.

539
00:24:29,900 --> 00:24:31,230
And comics like,
um,

540
00:24:31,280 --> 00:24:33,920
my friend Eddie gift,
he's huge over there.

541
00:24:33,950 --> 00:24:38,950
Huge guys sells out all over the place.
Does TV shows people come to see him 

542
00:24:38,950 --> 00:24:43,540
that he can.
He's told me they write about them in 

543
00:24:43,540 --> 00:24:43,540
the paper when he was at a bar,
but in America you can't,

544
00:24:43,540 --> 00:24:46,130
can't fucking get traction for whatever 
reason.

545
00:24:47,300 --> 00:24:52,100
Some UFC that was great use arch 
Barker's gigantic in Australia.

546
00:24:52,130 --> 00:24:54,710
Fucking monstrous.
He sold out someplace.

547
00:24:54,711 --> 00:24:56,840
Supposedly it was like a 1500 seat 
place.

548
00:24:56,960 --> 00:25:01,960
Sold it out.
Something like 20 something nights in a 

549
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:01,960
row.
I mean,

550
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:04,910
just craziness.
They love American comedians over there.

551
00:25:04,911 --> 00:25:07,460
So the show was fucking fantastic.
I had a great time.

552
00:25:07,650 --> 00:25:12,650
Few people walked out,
but that's going to happen and if you 

553
00:25:12,650 --> 00:25:12,860
don't know what you're getting into,
you know,

554
00:25:13,420 --> 00:25:17,420
I always try to tell people that if 
there was a big sign in the front of the

555
00:25:17,421 --> 00:25:19,200
show that said,
warning,

556
00:25:19,201 --> 00:25:24,201
this show will contain language and 
material as extreme as you could 

557
00:25:24,231 --> 00:25:25,190
possibly imagine.

558
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:29,240
But apparently some of the shit I said 
people couldn't imagine.

559
00:25:29,540 --> 00:25:34,540
So they didn't know what to expect but 
I'm sorry you bummed out,

560
00:25:34,971 --> 00:25:37,910
but I'm 99 percent of the people that 
have a great fucking time.

561
00:25:37,911 --> 00:25:38,890
But yeah,
it was pretty wild.

562
00:25:38,900 --> 00:25:42,140
Crazy show.
But also it was because we were hammered

563
00:25:42,141 --> 00:25:44,240
that night too.
So two nights in a row we got barbecued,

564
00:25:44,930 --> 00:25:47,630
so I was planning on going to Australia 
and doing all this.

565
00:25:47,631 --> 00:25:51,260
Writing the alcohol just sticks a fork 
and all those plans.

566
00:25:51,320 --> 00:25:52,790
You know,
you,

567
00:25:52,791 --> 00:25:57,791
you said that when he flew to Australia 
it's like 17 hours whereas the flight 

568
00:25:57,791 --> 00:25:59,690
really did it really feel like 17 hours 
because at the point where you were just

569
00:25:59,691 --> 00:26:00,380
like,
fuck this,

570
00:26:00,381 --> 00:26:02,920
I need to jump off this plane.
This is too much or no,

571
00:26:03,060 --> 00:26:03,770
no,
no,

572
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:05,450
it wasn't that bad.
You know,

573
00:26:05,451 --> 00:26:07,820
you just a cancer fighting,
you know,

574
00:26:07,880 --> 00:26:09,980
you just,
you've read,

575
00:26:10,130 --> 00:26:11,330
watch a fucking movie.

576
00:26:11,420 --> 00:26:16,420
Get on your laptop.
I was going over some material on the 

577
00:26:16,420 --> 00:26:19,991
way over there.
The real problem was once I got there I 

578
00:26:19,991 --> 00:26:20,780
thought I was going to write,
but it was just so it was all get drunk,

579
00:26:20,930 --> 00:26:23,290
recover from the drunk.
A lot of water.

580
00:26:23,310 --> 00:26:25,100
Construct again,
recover.

581
00:26:25,340 --> 00:26:28,910
You have like small little bedrooms.
All Nos on the plane,

582
00:26:28,911 --> 00:26:29,970
right?
Claim was doped.

583
00:26:30,050 --> 00:26:33,620
We flew first class on Quantis and then 
some think it's called the 80 3:10

584
00:26:33,621 --> 00:26:35,690
or something like that.
Giant ass fucking plane.

585
00:26:35,900 --> 00:26:38,010
And they're huge man.
They're the,

586
00:26:38,020 --> 00:26:38,630
the,
the like,

587
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:41,620
it's like a little apartment man,
wisdom like coach,

588
00:26:41,630 --> 00:26:42,150
like,
like,

589
00:26:42,530 --> 00:26:43,370
uh,
don't know,

590
00:26:43,460 --> 00:26:44,070
two times,

591
00:26:44,670 --> 00:26:49,670
three times.
Coaches are spoken coach you business 

592
00:26:49,670 --> 00:26:49,670
classes,

593
00:26:49,670 --> 00:26:51,560
pretty dope business classes just as 
good as first class.

594
00:26:51,590 --> 00:26:52,790
Wow.
Pretty close to it.

595
00:26:52,820 --> 00:26:55,760
But coach walk you,
they say tax.

596
00:26:56,730 --> 00:26:57,330
I'd been like,
Hey,

597
00:26:57,331 --> 00:27:02,331
let me hang out in your bedroom up here.
I can't imagine flying 16 hours from one

598
00:27:02,551 --> 00:27:03,680
of these.
Ask chairs.

599
00:27:03,690 --> 00:27:08,690
Just jam next.
Ralphie may on one side and Kevin Smith 

600
00:27:08,690 --> 00:27:12,201
and the other after they ran a marathon,
I can't believe that somebody actually.

601
00:27:12,340 --> 00:27:13,110
Kevin Smith

602
00:27:14,460 --> 00:27:16,740
dumber.
You do not know who he.

603
00:27:16,741 --> 00:27:18,360
I guess a lot of people don't know who 
he is.

604
00:27:18,730 --> 00:27:21,980
Like the way he looks like they don't 
know that that's all.

605
00:27:22,010 --> 00:27:27,010
That's that famous director.
You might want to shut the fuck up that 

606
00:27:27,010 --> 00:27:28,740
guys on twitter all day every day.
He probably ruined southwest.

607
00:27:28,950 --> 00:27:31,130
That cost them money for sure.
Don't you think?

608
00:27:31,660 --> 00:27:33,670
Well,
part of me thinks so.

609
00:27:33,671 --> 00:27:36,340
But then the other part of me is like,
they just got so much attention,

610
00:27:36,540 --> 00:27:39,220
you know?
And especially if you hate fat people,

611
00:27:39,430 --> 00:27:40,440
you'd be like,
fuck you,

612
00:27:40,441 --> 00:27:43,600
I'm going to southwest.
So they lost the fat dollar.

613
00:27:43,870 --> 00:27:45,730
I bet there's a lot of fat people have 
got bummed out.

614
00:27:45,731 --> 00:27:47,850
How's Ralphie may fly southwest because 
he it.

615
00:27:47,910 --> 00:27:49,420
You know how much money that probably 
saved them.

616
00:27:49,421 --> 00:27:52,030
All these pissed off fat people aren't 
flying southwest now.

617
00:27:52,031 --> 00:27:57,031
Just save them.
There's already studies that they were 

618
00:27:57,031 --> 00:27:58,180
thinking this is ridiculous.
They were thinking about making you take

619
00:27:58,181 --> 00:28:03,181
a shit before you flew because they've 
found out that if they made everyone go 

620
00:28:03,181 --> 00:28:03,760
to the bathroom before they got on the 
airplane,

621
00:28:03,761 --> 00:28:05,890
that they would say so many dollars per 
year.

622
00:28:06,030 --> 00:28:08,830
Like this was a real study that they 
were going into southwest.

623
00:28:08,970 --> 00:28:11,650
This wasn't southwest system is American
Airlines or something like that.

624
00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:16,920
So can you imagine now that they have 
all these fat people pissed off that 

625
00:28:16,920 --> 00:28:17,860
we're not going to fly southwest.
It's probably,

626
00:28:17,890 --> 00:28:20,350
they're probably earning $5,
million dollars a year.

627
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:26,440
Cost them more to fly,
like fuel wise to Australia for a fat 

628
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:27,090
guy then for electricity.

629
00:28:27,370 --> 00:28:32,370
Oh,
I'm sure it's big enough times 100 then 

630
00:28:32,370 --> 00:28:32,390
that than you would imagine.

631
00:28:32,410 --> 00:28:35,340
Oh my God.
Huh?

632
00:28:35,620 --> 00:28:36,520
Yeah.
Kind of makes sense.

633
00:28:36,610 --> 00:28:41,610
Maybe.
Maybe southwest paid Kevin Smith and 

634
00:28:41,610 --> 00:28:41,610
theirs is all just to save them a 
million.

635
00:28:41,610 --> 00:28:43,120
A couple million a year.
I would never do.

636
00:28:43,260 --> 00:28:47,200
It's like the integrity.
I met him.

637
00:28:47,201 --> 00:28:47,380
He was

638
00:28:47,410 --> 00:28:48,520
cool.
It wouldn't do that.

639
00:28:49,530 --> 00:28:51,700
He is really cool.
He's a nice guy.

640
00:28:52,100 --> 00:28:57,040
I met him when I came into k rock once.
Care Cue in La.

641
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:03,000
Very fun radio.
The last of the terrestrial radio 

642
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,950
stations in our La fucking radio in La 
has vanished.

643
00:29:06,160 --> 00:29:08,860
I'm wanting to do radio for a long time.
I was thinking about doing it,

644
00:29:09,150 --> 00:29:10,330
you know,
I was thinking,

645
00:29:10,340 --> 00:29:11,500
wow,
what a cool thing that would be.

646
00:29:11,501 --> 00:29:13,690
Like we have some interesting 
conversations.

647
00:29:13,691 --> 00:29:16,150
You take callers,
talk to people online and shit,

648
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:21,480
you know,
but it just died when they had that 97 

649
00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:21,790
point one FM talk.
I was like,

650
00:29:21,791 --> 00:29:22,880
how cool would that be?
Let's get out.

651
00:29:22,900 --> 00:29:25,050
Let's get on the fucking radio gig and 
now let's do.

652
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:26,450
Well.
You were going to do it in Denver.

653
00:29:26,451 --> 00:29:27,730
He repeated it back.
Yeah,

654
00:29:27,731 --> 00:29:32,731
I was thinking about doing it in Denver 
and I was thinking when you go back to 

655
00:29:32,731 --> 00:29:32,731
Denver,

656
00:29:32,731 --> 00:29:33,870
keep it will keep on asking me that.
Well this UFC in March,

657
00:29:33,871 --> 00:29:38,871
but um,
I haven't gotten a venue to do standup 

658
00:29:38,871 --> 00:29:39,660
app so I might just go back and I'm.
No,

659
00:29:39,690 --> 00:29:40,200
no,
no,

660
00:29:40,201 --> 00:29:41,260
stand up.
Just have fun.

661
00:29:41,970 --> 00:29:44,710
Just do the UFC.
I want to go back and check out my house

662
00:29:44,711 --> 00:29:47,050
and see if I can find a fucking mountain
lion that ate my dog.

663
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:50,380
When you came here and your dog was 
sitting on the front porch,

664
00:29:50,470 --> 00:29:55,310
he's been living off the land and he's 
this big butch lassie looking dog now

665
00:29:57,130 --> 00:29:58,390
and got Jack,
believe me,

666
00:29:58,391 --> 00:30:03,391
he was gone for weeks.
There's no way your dog does not 

667
00:30:03,391 --> 00:30:06,010
appreciate black peoples peoples.
Well,

668
00:30:06,011 --> 00:30:09,070
if dogs are around black people and then
also they see a black person,

669
00:30:09,071 --> 00:30:10,480
they're like,
what the fuck?

670
00:30:11,250 --> 00:30:12,610
Why did you that color?
What's going on?

671
00:30:12,810 --> 00:30:15,190
Can Dog see color?
They just see darkness.

672
00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:20,800
Don't dogs see in black and white?
Maybe you think it's a dude with a mask 

673
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:20,800
on.

674
00:30:21,950 --> 00:30:22,820
Okay.

675
00:30:23,680 --> 00:30:25,240
Oh,
okay.

676
00:30:25,500 --> 00:30:29,080
Gentlemen,
let's go to a the message Conan,

677
00:30:29,770 --> 00:30:31,900
Conan O'brien as a new look with the 
beard.

678
00:30:32,340 --> 00:30:32,870
Well,
you know what,

679
00:30:33,100 --> 00:30:37,240
he's got $35 million in the bank now.
It's just kicking it.

680
00:30:37,450 --> 00:30:42,450
You know,
today I interviewed a squirrel in my 

681
00:30:42,450 --> 00:30:45,040
backyard and then through to commercial,
somebody helped me.

682
00:30:46,890 --> 00:30:48,070
That's

683
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:50,600
pretty Tony and Brian now as a twitter.
By the way,

684
00:30:50,601 --> 00:30:54,890
it's Conan O'brien.
The I love the whole Conan store.

685
00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:57,260
It just shows you how retarded networks 
are,

686
00:30:57,530 --> 00:31:02,530
you know,
and first of all they should have never 

687
00:31:02,530 --> 00:31:02,530
changed shit,
you know what they should've done.

688
00:31:02,530 --> 00:31:05,240
I appreciate the Jimmy Fallon people 
enjoy Jimmy Fallon's show,

689
00:31:05,480 --> 00:31:08,240
but you know what?
Put that on after Conan O'brien,

690
00:31:08,360 --> 00:31:10,160
you know,
go back to the way you had it.

691
00:31:10,161 --> 00:31:15,161
Don't be stupid.
You want to go Jay Leno tonight show 

692
00:31:15,161 --> 00:31:18,760
while you want to go middle America,
throw softballs and not offend anybody,

693
00:31:19,250 --> 00:31:23,390
and then keep the Conan O'brien show 
where it was because we'd Conan's on.

694
00:31:23,510 --> 00:31:26,210
He can do,
you know all that craziness,

695
00:31:26,211 --> 00:31:31,211
the fucking insult dog masturbating.
But you can do it late at night because 

696
00:31:31,211 --> 00:31:31,850
you're allowed to do more crazy shit 
late at night.

697
00:31:32,120 --> 00:31:37,120
You know what's his face went?
Remember when we were talking to norm 

698
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:37,730
Macdonald's outside the ice house.
He had the best point norm.

699
00:31:37,731 --> 00:31:38,960
Mcdonald goes.
He goes,

700
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:40,880
well,
I can never make one time.

701
00:31:40,881 --> 00:31:45,881
He's on anyway.
Nobody watches it and watch it on your 

702
00:31:45,881 --> 00:31:45,881
dvr.
Yeah,

703
00:31:45,881 --> 00:31:45,881
yeah,
yeah.

704
00:31:45,881 --> 00:31:47,180
See It on Youtube.
Who Cares?

705
00:31:47,181 --> 00:31:51,260
Rianna 1130 or 1230.
It's 12 years better is you can get away

706
00:31:51,261 --> 00:31:51,800
with more shit.

707
00:31:51,940 --> 00:31:54,580
He was totally right.
I like how you're saying all this,

708
00:31:54,581 --> 00:31:56,590
but yeah,
his phone was from 1982,

709
00:31:56,620 --> 00:32:00,510
so as I have it on the phone at all.
When I,

710
00:32:00,580 --> 00:32:01,150
when I ran out,

711
00:32:01,180 --> 00:32:02,980
Jim,
I ran into dawn Mcdonald once when I was

712
00:32:02,981 --> 00:32:06,010
doing some Canadian gigs like uh,
a couple of years ago.

713
00:32:06,180 --> 00:32:08,580
And when I ran into him,
he didn't have a cell phone.

714
00:32:08,590 --> 00:32:09,760
I had to call his home phone.

715
00:32:09,810 --> 00:32:11,850
That's right.
It never fucking cell phone.

716
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:17,240
He didn't have one because I don't want 
people to just be able to get in touch 

717
00:32:17,240 --> 00:32:18,730
with me.
Fuck off.

718
00:32:18,950 --> 00:32:20,340
Disappear.
Know that dude.

719
00:32:21,060 --> 00:32:22,560
Yeah,
he's hilarious man.

720
00:32:22,950 --> 00:32:27,950
He's a norm.
Macdonald hosted a talk show would be 

721
00:32:27,950 --> 00:32:27,950
the shit.
Yeah,

722
00:32:27,950 --> 00:32:28,020
that would be.
I would,

723
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:31,320
I would tune into that talk show because
he wouldn't let get people get away with

724
00:32:31,321 --> 00:32:32,550
anything.
You know?

725
00:32:32,610 --> 00:32:33,540
He's,
he's nuts.

726
00:32:33,570 --> 00:32:34,110
You know,
he's,

727
00:32:34,170 --> 00:32:35,580
he's a loose dude.
He's wild.

728
00:32:35,770 --> 00:32:40,770
You'd be a good couch guy for like Conan
because have you ever seen him on the 

729
00:32:40,770 --> 00:32:40,770
couch?
Like,

730
00:32:40,770 --> 00:32:40,770
I forget

731
00:32:40,770 --> 00:32:42,620
who it was in the whole time.
He was like cracking jokes.

732
00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:46,940
That was awesome.
Wasn't it would be a good like good side

733
00:32:46,941 --> 00:32:47,720
guy.
Yeah.

734
00:32:47,900 --> 00:32:51,350
And you know like have like a straight 
guy and then he gets the side guy.

735
00:32:51,890 --> 00:32:54,050
What is my take on the weed stores in 
La?

736
00:32:54,051 --> 00:32:56,720
Getting raided.
It fucking sucks.

737
00:32:56,870 --> 00:32:58,310
You know,
the whole thing makes me,

738
00:32:58,380 --> 00:33:00,440
it makes me sick.
You know,

739
00:33:00,470 --> 00:33:03,760
the whole thing is so,
so strange,

740
00:33:03,920 --> 00:33:08,920
man.
It's so strange that they're still 

741
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:11,891
fucking with people.
Apparently the way the law is presented 

742
00:33:11,891 --> 00:33:11,891
though,
and California and I,

743
00:33:11,891 --> 00:33:13,250
I'm not sure this,
um,

744
00:33:13,520 --> 00:33:18,520
is that they believe that the way the 
law is presented is that you can give 

745
00:33:18,621 --> 00:33:23,621
weed away and you can sell it as long as
you're not making a profit and that 

746
00:33:23,850 --> 00:33:28,850
these collectives are supposed to be to 
provide medical patients with marijuana.

747
00:33:29,121 --> 00:33:34,121
But apparently there's people out there 
that are flaunting the wealth and 

748
00:33:34,121 --> 00:33:35,030
they're making a fuck load of money off 
of it.

749
00:33:35,030 --> 00:33:37,190
Millions and millions of dollars off 
selling wheat.

750
00:33:37,670 --> 00:33:39,440
Now,
if that's the case,

751
00:33:39,740 --> 00:33:42,950
there's two parts of me,
one part of me that says,

752
00:33:42,951 --> 00:33:43,670
well,
you know what?

753
00:33:43,671 --> 00:33:45,260
Fuck you,
they should be able to sell it.

754
00:33:45,261 --> 00:33:46,030
You know,
you're,

755
00:33:46,050 --> 00:33:48,770
you guys are Douche bags.
But another part of me says,

756
00:33:49,070 --> 00:33:50,690
hmm,
maybe it'd be better.

757
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:52,940
Maybe it would be really in the spirit 
of weed.

758
00:33:52,941 --> 00:33:57,941
If it was free,
maybe you really would be in the spirit 

759
00:33:57,941 --> 00:33:58,820
of weed that it isn't,
that there isn't a for profit.

760
00:33:59,010 --> 00:34:00,220
You know,
people will don't,

761
00:34:00,310 --> 00:34:05,310
man,
these stores couldn't exist and they 

762
00:34:05,310 --> 00:34:05,310
couldn't sell it.
Yeah.

763
00:34:05,310 --> 00:34:09,011
But we,
it's not that hard to grow them and 

764
00:34:09,011 --> 00:34:09,011
people would still grow and sell weed 
and you know,

765
00:34:09,011 --> 00:34:09,440
people will sell it illegally.
I mean,

766
00:34:09,441 --> 00:34:10,760
there would be plenty of people that 
would,

767
00:34:10,920 --> 00:34:12,310
you know,
if you want good weed,

768
00:34:12,311 --> 00:34:14,240
you got to talk to this guy and it's 
expensive.

769
00:34:15,140 --> 00:34:18,230
But I kinda liked the idea of it not 
being for profit.

770
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:20,150
There's something about it,
uh,

771
00:34:20,180 --> 00:34:21,380
that,
that bugs me,

772
00:34:21,381 --> 00:34:25,010
that people are overcharging for this 
plant just because it's illegal and it's

773
00:34:25,060 --> 00:34:27,590
fucking,
some places it's super expensive,

774
00:34:27,620 --> 00:34:28,460
you know,
five,

775
00:34:28,461 --> 00:34:31,430
$600 an ounce for like really powerful,
potent weed,

776
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:37,000
you know,
which I understand that God should get 

777
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:37,370
paid for is growing and this and that 
and I totally respect that.

778
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:39,980
You should be able to make a certain 
amount of money for it.

779
00:34:39,981 --> 00:34:44,981
But if it was legal,
it would be way fucking cheaper than it 

780
00:34:44,981 --> 00:34:49,001
is right now.
The reality is the reason why it's 

781
00:34:49,001 --> 00:34:51,401
expensive at all,
the reason why these guys can make 

782
00:34:51,401 --> 00:34:53,891
millions of dollars in profit off of 
selling weed is only because it's 

783
00:34:53,891 --> 00:34:55,100
illegal and difficult to get and you 
have to get it from these places.

784
00:34:55,250 --> 00:34:57,530
If marijuana was legal and you could 
grow your own,

785
00:34:57,650 --> 00:35:00,470
which is how it should be,
you would have no need to buy it.

786
00:35:00,650 --> 00:35:05,650
You could have a little fucking plant 
your backyard or in my closet is like 

787
00:35:05,650 --> 00:35:05,840
that,
but it's not.

788
00:35:05,841 --> 00:35:08,210
This guy got fucking arrested.
It's not.

789
00:35:08,510 --> 00:35:13,510
This guy just got arrested.
This guy just got arrested with 24 

790
00:35:13,510 --> 00:35:16,691
different counts and he's going to 
charge him and the way it works 

791
00:35:16,691 --> 00:35:20,951
apparently is what Obama has said is 
that they're not going to charge people 

792
00:35:20,951 --> 00:35:24,560
who were,
who were only violating federal law 

793
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:24,560
federally.
It's illegal.

794
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:28,870
They're going to go after people who are
going to violate both the federal and 

795
00:35:28,870 --> 00:35:32,231
state laws.
So you have to follow the state law to 

796
00:35:32,231 --> 00:35:32,570
the letter and they're making an example
out of this one dude.

797
00:35:32,571 --> 00:35:34,040
Apparently.
Well,

798
00:35:34,041 --> 00:35:39,041
I mean if you go and get a license,
you're allowed to grow white seven or 

799
00:35:39,041 --> 00:35:39,041
something like

800
00:35:39,041 --> 00:35:39,041
that.
Yeah,

801
00:35:39,041 --> 00:35:43,580
you're allowed to grow a lot.
You're allowed to have like a half a 

802
00:35:43,580 --> 00:35:45,950
pound of weed and get the other license 
that you can do up to like 21 plants.

803
00:35:46,750 --> 00:35:47,680
So I got that.
Yeah,

804
00:35:47,700 --> 00:35:52,700
you have that.
For some reason they asked me if I need 

805
00:35:52,700 --> 00:35:54,690
an exemption,
but I said what's an exemption for?

806
00:35:54,700 --> 00:35:55,170
He goes,
well,

807
00:35:55,230 --> 00:36:00,230
you know,
the regular amount of weed is not 

808
00:36:00,230 --> 00:36:00,230
enough.
Although yes,

809
00:36:00,230 --> 00:36:00,720
the regular amount is not enough.
I need more.

810
00:36:01,030 --> 00:36:03,390
You could pretty much anyone,
anyone can get back.

811
00:36:03,480 --> 00:36:05,910
Even even kids could probably get this 
shit,

812
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:10,560
but if they can get that license.
So if you just grow within your amount,

813
00:36:10,590 --> 00:36:15,590
you could pretty much do that now.
And even if the cops came over your 

814
00:36:15,590 --> 00:36:15,590
house,
right.

815
00:36:15,590 --> 00:36:18,630
But it could be people that don't have 
the room to grow and they don't want to 

816
00:36:18,630 --> 00:36:22,371
be hassled and they want to be able to 
go out and purchase it at a reasonable 

817
00:36:22,371 --> 00:36:22,371
rate.

818
00:36:22,371 --> 00:36:23,160
And I agree that there is a reasonable 
rate.

819
00:36:23,161 --> 00:36:26,880
But right now the rate is so high that 
marijuana is worth more than gold.

820
00:36:27,480 --> 00:36:30,590
Marijuana is worth more,
worth more per pound than gold is.

821
00:36:30,600 --> 00:36:32,700
That seems a little crazy.
You know,

822
00:36:32,701 --> 00:36:37,701
I mean,
it's definitely inflated because of the 

823
00:36:37,701 --> 00:36:39,861
fact that there's no competition because
of the fact that it's illegal and it's 

824
00:36:39,861 --> 00:36:40,140
so fucking plant.
It should be legal.

825
00:36:40,141 --> 00:36:42,300
Everybody should be able to grow it.
And if it was legal,

826
00:36:42,420 --> 00:36:44,700
there would be nobody making millions 
and millions of dollars off of.

827
00:36:44,720 --> 00:36:49,720
The real problem is it would fuck the 
economy up because pharmaceutical 

828
00:36:49,720 --> 00:36:51,360
companies,
which is fucking nosedive,

829
00:36:51,540 --> 00:36:54,330
there'd be so many different 
pharmaceutical products.

830
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:57,870
That would be that there would be 
useless.

831
00:36:58,220 --> 00:36:58,600
I,
you know,

832
00:36:58,690 --> 00:37:01,680
I believe that to a point,
but right now I have,

833
00:37:01,681 --> 00:37:05,460
we whenever I want have wheat,
but I still have Tom's for my stomach.

834
00:37:05,460 --> 00:37:07,050
I still have aspirin for headaches,
you know,

835
00:37:07,140 --> 00:37:10,740
they didn't replace any.
You don't have fucking glow coma dude.

836
00:37:10,760 --> 00:37:15,760
You know,
there's a lot of different medications 

837
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:15,760
for add.
There's a lot.

838
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:17,860
Those are the billion dollar medicines.
It's not tom's Bro.

839
00:37:17,880 --> 00:37:22,880
But you know what description and most 
of these people that are saying that 

840
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:25,230
it's the best drug for a glaucoma and 
stuff are just hippies wanting.

841
00:37:25,231 --> 00:37:27,310
We'd to be illegal because if you.
If you look at them,

842
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:29,880
the medication for Glaucoma in 
comparison,

843
00:37:30,060 --> 00:37:35,060
I bet you it's better than not.
It is the best for interocular pressure.

844
00:37:36,661 --> 00:37:39,780
I believe that it's what's called when,
when Glaucoma.

845
00:37:39,781 --> 00:37:44,781
Apparently it's very painful for people 
and marijuana apparently is the best at 

846
00:37:44,781 --> 00:37:48,771
relieving that.
It's the best ever restoring people's 

847
00:37:48,771 --> 00:37:50,040
appetite when they have chemotherapy.
That's why cancer patients like it.

848
00:37:50,190 --> 00:37:55,190
It's the best at it.
Suppressed that a lot of different 

849
00:37:55,190 --> 00:37:55,190
things do.

850
00:37:55,190 --> 00:37:55,890
There's people that have had kids that 
have autism.

851
00:37:56,040 --> 00:38:01,040
There's a video that we showed them that
clip that autism and that was the only 

852
00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:02,640
thing that calm the kid down,
made him normal was we'd,

853
00:38:02,970 --> 00:38:05,040
you know,
it's great for a lot of different things

854
00:38:05,041 --> 00:38:10,041
and all those different things are 
prescription drugs that are worth 

855
00:38:10,041 --> 00:38:12,210
fucking billions of dollars every year 
to pharmaceutical companies,

856
00:38:12,211 --> 00:38:16,050
which is why they lobby against 
recreational drugs,

857
00:38:16,130 --> 00:38:21,130
so called recreational drugs.
It's just why to this day partnership 

858
00:38:21,130 --> 00:38:24,180
for drug free America to this day gets 
money from pharmaceutical companies.

859
00:38:24,360 --> 00:38:26,910
They got money from alcohol companies 
and tobacco companies,

860
00:38:26,911 --> 00:38:30,180
millions and millions of dollars in the 
past and because of that there was a lot

861
00:38:30,181 --> 00:38:33,390
of criticism so they no longer get money
from alcohol and tobacco companies,

862
00:38:33,391 --> 00:38:38,391
but they still get money from 
pharmaceutical companies and 

863
00:38:38,391 --> 00:38:38,391
pharmaceutical

864
00:38:38,391 --> 00:38:39,400
companies are responsible for oxycodone,
Vicodin,

865
00:38:39,460 --> 00:38:41,050
percocet,
all that shit.

866
00:38:41,051 --> 00:38:43,930
I still don't think it's going to be 
like if they made it legal,

867
00:38:43,990 --> 00:38:46,090
like all these companies are going go 
out of business.

868
00:38:46,091 --> 00:38:47,770
I know my mom's not going to be smoking 
weed.

869
00:38:47,771 --> 00:38:48,220
She's gonna.
Be like,

870
00:38:48,221 --> 00:38:48,730
no,
I'll take.

871
00:38:48,731 --> 00:38:53,140
The other thing would be dumb enough for
a few generations.

872
00:38:53,141 --> 00:38:58,141
Yeah,
there would be dominoes we just doesn't 

873
00:38:58,141 --> 00:39:00,511
work with and that's like that's percent
60 percent is that in exchange for the 

874
00:39:00,511 --> 00:39:00,511
things that we do

875
00:39:00,511 --> 00:39:03,250
talked about,
it's not 50 or 60 percent will weed is a

876
00:39:03,251 --> 00:39:05,710
real effective medicine for a bunch of 
different things,

877
00:39:06,070 --> 00:39:08,650
but more importantly it be great for 
textiles.

878
00:39:08,830 --> 00:39:10,780
It would be great for.
You can eat it.

879
00:39:10,781 --> 00:39:11,350
You can.
I mean,

880
00:39:11,351 --> 00:39:13,690
it has all the essential fatty acids and
the seeds,

881
00:39:13,930 --> 00:39:15,400
you know,
amino acids.

882
00:39:15,530 --> 00:39:20,530
There's a lot of different fucking 
things that marijuana is good for 

883
00:39:20,530 --> 00:39:20,800
besides just just getting you high.
Right.

884
00:39:20,860 --> 00:39:25,860
It's incredible that it's illegal.
It's really mind blowing that it's 

885
00:39:25,860 --> 00:39:29,731
illegal,
but in 2010 with the access to 

886
00:39:29,731 --> 00:39:30,070
information than we have today,
the fact that it's still illegal.

887
00:39:30,310 --> 00:39:32,210
That's fucking insane,
man.

888
00:39:33,020 --> 00:39:34,480
Because you streamed laggy.
Yeah.

889
00:39:34,481 --> 00:39:35,860
You streams always laggy,
man.

890
00:39:35,861 --> 00:39:38,280
Anything on the Internet slab you'd.
Nothing works perfect.

891
00:39:38,300 --> 00:39:41,800
This is fucking.
The Internet is in a stage right now.

892
00:39:41,801 --> 00:39:46,801
It's not done yet.
The irs plane crash or guy having a 

893
00:39:48,491 --> 00:39:53,491
hanger coal leased by Member of Homeland
Security and having ties to intelligence

894
00:39:54,701 --> 00:39:55,510
agencies.

895
00:39:55,990 --> 00:39:57,070
Is that true?
Well,

896
00:39:57,071 --> 00:39:59,620
I know that he stole that plane,
so I don't know.

897
00:39:59,621 --> 00:40:01,780
It wasn't his plane.
If that's what you're talking about.

898
00:40:01,870 --> 00:40:03,040
Oh,
you know what?

899
00:40:03,070 --> 00:40:08,070
I'm all for that guy because what's your
offer that granite crashes building is 

900
00:40:08,070 --> 00:40:09,070
planning.
Anyone die in that?

901
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:10,530
Yes.
All right.

902
00:40:11,830 --> 00:40:14,440
Fuck the irs.
Wow.

903
00:40:14,500 --> 00:40:16,210
I'm still dealing with them.
Bullshit.

904
00:40:17,610 --> 00:40:18,840
They're like fucking bullet.
Okay.

905
00:40:18,841 --> 00:40:20,040
This bad,
bad,

906
00:40:20,100 --> 00:40:23,580
bad.
Bobby's telling me that gold is $1,100

907
00:40:23,581 --> 00:40:28,581
an ounce in a British Columbia and the 
best weed is $3,200

908
00:40:29,191 --> 00:40:34,191
a pound and eight more than gold.
It's going for less than $17,000

909
00:40:35,131 --> 00:40:36,270
a pound here in the US.
Oh,

910
00:40:36,271 --> 00:40:37,950
I stand corrected.
Thank you very much,

911
00:40:37,951 --> 00:40:38,190
sir.

912
00:40:38,500 --> 00:40:40,890
That sounds better.
That sounds better now the way I said.

913
00:40:41,790 --> 00:40:44,180
Yeah,
I know what's worth more than gold.

914
00:40:44,190 --> 00:40:47,400
Cash Hash is worth more than gold,
isn't it?

915
00:40:47,880 --> 00:40:51,330
Damn Hash is expensive as fuck.
How much is a pound of Hash?

916
00:40:51,331 --> 00:40:54,930
Go for more than an hour and a half by 
half ass.

917
00:40:55,410 --> 00:40:58,410
Fucking punch a hole through to another 
dimension to measure.

918
00:40:58,411 --> 00:41:02,220
We smoked a pound of Hash Hash.
They make out a weed somehow or another.

919
00:41:02,221 --> 00:41:04,790
I'm known as the president to do it.
So resin the resin.

920
00:41:05,190 --> 00:41:06,660
How do they do it though?
Do you know how they make it?

921
00:41:06,870 --> 00:41:11,870
A bit of a complicated process,
but I've had it before and it's very 

922
00:41:11,870 --> 00:41:12,480
deep.
It's a strange high.

923
00:41:13,320 --> 00:41:14,560
It's very,
very good.

924
00:41:14,830 --> 00:41:16,170
Mr.
Strong.

925
00:41:16,290 --> 00:41:19,570
I might do opium again.
Opens you did opium?

926
00:41:19,700 --> 00:41:21,760
Fuck yeah.
It's not much different than ash.

927
00:41:22,050 --> 00:41:22,920
Really?
Yeah.

928
00:41:23,370 --> 00:41:27,900
It looks a little like no heroin.
No,

929
00:41:28,050 --> 00:41:29,280
no.
It's like a.

930
00:41:30,090 --> 00:41:34,410
It looks like a piece of soap.
It smokes like a smokes.

931
00:41:34,470 --> 00:41:37,730
Smokes like hash in it.
It smells like a Hippie,

932
00:41:37,990 --> 00:41:42,990
like petroleum.
It smells like Petroli when it burns 

933
00:41:42,990 --> 00:41:42,990
real.
Yeah.

934
00:41:42,990 --> 00:41:43,040
It's,
it's kind of like,

935
00:41:43,340 --> 00:41:46,250
I dunno,
like a hash kind of feeling.

936
00:41:47,770 --> 00:41:49,930
Hm.
I'm scared man.

937
00:41:52,570 --> 00:41:54,310
Yeah.
The gold thing.

938
00:41:54,311 --> 00:41:56,130
I didn't really research that way.
Well,

939
00:41:56,290 --> 00:41:57,900
it was something else.
Sorry,

940
00:41:58,190 --> 00:42:01,810
I said that incorrectly.
There's something else that,

941
00:42:01,930 --> 00:42:04,900
that marijuana was more expensive than 
per ounce.

942
00:42:05,170 --> 00:42:07,630
It was oil.
Does that make sense?

943
00:42:08,260 --> 00:42:13,260
Worth more than oil.
I'm worth more than something that's 

944
00:42:13,260 --> 00:42:13,380
worth a lot.
Uh,

945
00:42:14,590 --> 00:42:18,370
let's go with some other questions here.
Dan,

946
00:42:18,371 --> 00:42:22,790
with the USTREAM powerful ustream.
Opium smells like flowers and it's super

947
00:42:22,791 --> 00:42:27,791
addictive from the poppy faggot.
While you're doing something super 

948
00:42:27,791 --> 00:42:27,940
addictive.
Brian's already addicted.

949
00:42:29,020 --> 00:42:34,020
Addicted.
Brian had had a hangnail and that got 

950
00:42:34,020 --> 00:42:34,020
them to start smoking again.

951
00:42:34,020 --> 00:42:34,250
No,
it was.

952
00:42:34,270 --> 00:42:38,410
And I got audited by the irs for that.
As you cat got a hangnail no,

953
00:42:38,630 --> 00:42:41,470
now that was my cat.
Had a fucked up foot Canada,

954
00:42:42,760 --> 00:42:44,530
his cabinet,
Canada fucked up.

955
00:42:44,660 --> 00:42:46,830
Fuck,
fucking can't take it anymore.

956
00:42:47,530 --> 00:42:50,530
Cigarettes because cigarettes out of 
nowhere,

957
00:42:50,590 --> 00:42:51,640
you'll be like,
dude,

958
00:42:51,641 --> 00:42:53,260
I need a cigarette.
I need a cigarette.

959
00:42:53,340 --> 00:42:55,660
And it's one of those things.
Once you do it,

960
00:42:55,810 --> 00:42:59,440
it opens up a door that's always gonna.
Be Open and it's weird.

961
00:42:59,470 --> 00:43:02,010
Cigarettes or this guy did you know you 
can add to that

962
00:43:02,030 --> 00:43:06,220
late your pineal by saying the word love
at a certain frequency.

963
00:43:06,310 --> 00:43:08,170
Shut up,
shut the fuck up.

964
00:43:08,280 --> 00:43:13,280
Just like that.
Shot up like the new Mariah Carey Song 

965
00:43:13,280 --> 00:43:15,511
is,
has a high enough pitch to open up your 

966
00:43:15,511 --> 00:43:15,511
garage doors.
No,

967
00:43:15,511 --> 00:43:15,511
it doesn't,

968
00:43:18,600 --> 00:43:22,620
but loves to say stupid people love 
fucking magic.

969
00:43:22,710 --> 00:43:25,090
They love magic and nonsense.
You know,

970
00:43:25,140 --> 00:43:27,660
they love to think that there is like 
something like that.

971
00:43:27,720 --> 00:43:29,760
There's real magic.
The real magic.

972
00:43:30,090 --> 00:43:32,830
Eat a pound of mushrooms.
The magic,

973
00:43:33,330 --> 00:43:36,990
instead of having a 16 ounce steak have 
16 ounces of mushrooms.

974
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:38,140
Motherfucker.
Shit,

975
00:43:39,900 --> 00:43:41,400
that's magic.
You know?

976
00:43:41,401 --> 00:43:46,401
Yeah.
You will magically be retarded for the 

977
00:43:46,401 --> 00:43:48,321
rest of your life.
You'll probably be communicating with 

978
00:43:48,321 --> 00:43:50,330
aliens permanently.
You'll probably be locked into another 

979
00:43:50,330 --> 00:43:50,580
dimension.
You know,

980
00:43:54,840 --> 00:43:58,800
tell Jerry Garcia smoking opium wasn't 
addicted addicted.

981
00:43:58,830 --> 00:44:01,590
He moved to smoking black tar heroin 
after that.

982
00:44:02,010 --> 00:44:03,240
Well,
it's for sure.

983
00:44:03,241 --> 00:44:05,430
Did they used to have an opium dens back
in the wild west?

984
00:44:05,431 --> 00:44:06,180
Don't you remember?

985
00:44:06,270 --> 00:44:09,240
But I never wanted it open the next day 
thought about,

986
00:44:09,270 --> 00:44:10,170
oh my God,
I need it.

987
00:44:10,360 --> 00:44:11,490
You know,
it was never like that.

988
00:44:11,970 --> 00:44:16,970
Cocaine was kind of like that.
But for me by that opiod never was like 

989
00:44:16,970 --> 00:44:21,290
that.
That was more of like a treat like a 

990
00:44:21,290 --> 00:44:21,290
dessert.

991
00:44:21,290 --> 00:44:21,290
Well,
you know,

992
00:44:21,290 --> 00:44:24,020
there's a good argument because this 
argument was on the message board as 

993
00:44:24,020 --> 00:44:27,821
well.
People were talking about things being 

994
00:44:27,821 --> 00:44:29,531
addictive and hit.
The problem with even alcohol being 

995
00:44:29,531 --> 00:44:29,531
addictive is that it's not addictive.
Everybody,

996
00:44:29,720 --> 00:44:30,950
you know,
I'm not addicted to.

997
00:44:31,410 --> 00:44:36,410
I could,
I could not have a drink every day for 

998
00:44:36,410 --> 00:44:36,410
the rest of my life and I'd have no 
problem with that.

999
00:44:36,410 --> 00:44:38,730
But I like to have a drink sometimes and
go on stage.

1000
00:44:38,880 --> 00:44:41,720
I like to have a drink sometimes my 
buddies just to make things fun.

1001
00:44:41,730 --> 00:44:44,400
Just makes you get crazy.
You pay for it the next day though.

1002
00:44:44,460 --> 00:44:46,290
Especially rh.
Yeah,

1003
00:44:46,350 --> 00:44:47,150
man,
you get older,

1004
00:44:47,160 --> 00:44:52,160
do you pay for it more?
But the bottom line is it's not 

1005
00:44:52,160 --> 00:44:52,160
addictive.
Like I don't,

1006
00:44:52,160 --> 00:44:53,190
I don't hurt when I don't have it,
but for some people it is.

1007
00:44:53,550 --> 00:44:56,580
Some people have to have a drink.
When I was doing construction,

1008
00:44:56,610 --> 00:45:01,610
when I was a kid,
there was a dude who had a mountain dew 

1009
00:45:01,610 --> 00:45:02,760
bottle and he would fill it up with 
fucking beer,

1010
00:45:02,960 --> 00:45:06,840
just like cheap beer,
like colt 45 and he would drink beer all

1011
00:45:06,841 --> 00:45:08,160
day while we worked all day.

1012
00:45:08,190 --> 00:45:10,130
This guy was,
he was shaky.

1013
00:45:10,170 --> 00:45:12,210
Jones and Duke.
He would show up for work though.

1014
00:45:12,360 --> 00:45:17,360
He was there every fucking day.
Seven in the morning swinging that 

1015
00:45:17,360 --> 00:45:17,360
hammer,
you know,

1016
00:45:17,360 --> 00:45:19,920
he was there pissing every five minutes.
That was always hammered though.

1017
00:45:20,130 --> 00:45:22,560
He was drinking beer all day for that 
dude though.

1018
00:45:22,830 --> 00:45:25,410
I think it's like everybody's got their 
own biochemical makeup.

1019
00:45:25,590 --> 00:45:28,870
It's like you're addicted to cigarettes.
But like Thompson Thompson,

1020
00:45:28,910 --> 00:45:32,700
guerra smoked cigarettes when he drinks 
but doesn't smoke other times and he can

1021
00:45:32,701 --> 00:45:34,560
go years without cigarettes with no 
problem.

1022
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:36,870
But when he drinks he likes to have a 
cigarette.

1023
00:45:37,080 --> 00:45:39,240
When was the last meeting went a year 
with no problem.

1024
00:45:39,241 --> 00:45:44,241
Now.
Well he's sending has taken a long time 

1025
00:45:44,241 --> 00:45:46,251
off.
He's taking time off a bunch of times 

1026
00:45:46,251 --> 00:45:46,251
and he won't smoke for months and then 
he'll have a cigarette,

1027
00:45:46,251 --> 00:45:51,080
they'll have a cigarette when he drinks.
I definitely think cigarettes is like 

1028
00:45:51,080 --> 00:45:51,330
that one thing that even if you quit 
smoking,

1029
00:45:51,450 --> 00:45:55,080
it can be three years later in avondale 
where they'll start smoking again.

1030
00:45:55,200 --> 00:45:57,760
No reason why.
I know you said that as soon as red.

1031
00:45:57,761 --> 00:45:58,830
So I,
I think,

1032
00:45:58,890 --> 00:46:00,750
you know,
I think they're doing something.

1033
00:46:00,751 --> 00:46:03,760
Remember that movie the insider with 
Russell Crowe or see that movie?

1034
00:46:03,761 --> 00:46:08,761
Yeah.
It was all about like all the shit that 

1035
00:46:08,761 --> 00:46:08,761
they do to cigarettes to make it even 
more addictive,

1036
00:46:08,761 --> 00:46:12,651
like hundreds of different additives,
hundreds of different additives just to 

1037
00:46:12,651 --> 00:46:13,970
make it more addictive.
And I've,

1038
00:46:14,230 --> 00:46:16,290
I totally believe that's true.
Totally.

1039
00:46:16,291 --> 00:46:18,720
One hundred percent believe that's true.
And if that's the case,

1040
00:46:19,050 --> 00:46:20,550
man,
I mean who the fuck knows?

1041
00:46:20,580 --> 00:46:22,500
I mean they say that cigarettes are 
more,

1042
00:46:22,590 --> 00:46:25,830
it's not as dangerous as heroin because 
heroin will kill you quicker and you can

1043
00:46:25,831 --> 00:46:30,831
overdose from it.
But cigarettes will get you hooked 

1044
00:46:30,831 --> 00:46:30,831
quicker than anything,
like apparently if you,

1045
00:46:30,831 --> 00:46:33,720
if you have that thing inside you that 
gets you hooked to shit like that,

1046
00:46:33,890 --> 00:46:37,390
but I don't,
but I that cigarettes do totally.

1047
00:46:37,600 --> 00:46:39,130
He with cocaine too,
you said?

1048
00:46:39,280 --> 00:46:44,280
Well I almost,
because I was selling it and getting a 

1049
00:46:44,280 --> 00:46:46,831
large amounts of it for free.
You were allegedly allegedly selling 

1050
00:46:46,831 --> 00:46:51,060
really selling me.
It's just like this is like a character 

1051
00:46:51,060 --> 00:46:55,141
that would buy a large amount so he 
could give it away and have some extra 

1052
00:46:55,141 --> 00:46:56,390
for free.
It was Peter Pan of have.

1053
00:46:56,470 --> 00:46:57,340
No,
not Peter Pan.

1054
00:46:57,370 --> 00:47:02,370
Robin Hood of cocaine was like one month
of my life back in [inaudible] 94 in 

1055
00:47:02,370 --> 00:47:03,850
this fictional story.
And it's takes an old story.

1056
00:47:04,180 --> 00:47:06,490
But anyways,
if you were rich,

1057
00:47:06,520 --> 00:47:07,320
okay,
what if you will,

1058
00:47:09,010 --> 00:47:11,200
what if you like Jay z baller,
you know,

1059
00:47:11,470 --> 00:47:16,470
private jet rich and you could just get 
pure cocaine shipped right over here 

1060
00:47:16,470 --> 00:47:20,401
from the CIA.
The CIA would drop it off on your 

1061
00:47:20,401 --> 00:47:20,401
doorstep.
Well,

1062
00:47:20,401 --> 00:47:20,520
I think I go back into the program.

1063
00:47:20,570 --> 00:47:25,570
I think the only reason it was kind of 
addictive to me because I am one of 

1064
00:47:25,570 --> 00:47:26,950
those people that never go to the 
doctors and I probably need to be one of

1065
00:47:26,951 --> 00:47:31,951
those people that are on speed or 
something because I like having a 

1066
00:47:31,951 --> 00:47:32,860
thyroid.
I like having a thyroid condition.

1067
00:47:32,861 --> 00:47:37,780
Most of my day is spent like moping 
around energy and stuff like that.

1068
00:47:37,840 --> 00:47:39,190
But uh,
uh,

1069
00:47:39,460 --> 00:47:44,460
when cocaine,
I felt like I was alive for the first 

1070
00:47:44,460 --> 00:47:46,381
time and I think that's what was 
addictive more of just like I felt like 

1071
00:47:46,381 --> 00:47:46,870
I was out of some kind of coma.
Well,

1072
00:47:46,871 --> 00:47:51,871
sometimes,
well sometimes I'm having like a normal 

1073
00:47:51,871 --> 00:47:54,361
day,
like I'm not really into anything and 

1074
00:47:54,361 --> 00:47:54,361
I'll have a cup of coffee and God damn 
it,

1075
00:47:54,361 --> 00:47:54,361
I just get fucking fired up.
I.

1076
00:47:54,361 --> 00:47:54,860
Right.
Great.

1077
00:47:54,910 --> 00:47:56,320
Yeah.
I feel good about life.

1078
00:47:56,590 --> 00:47:59,810
Fucking feels like the warm sun feels 
better to clean my office.

1079
00:47:59,960 --> 00:48:01,750
We get a little fired up from 
stimulants,

1080
00:48:01,751 --> 00:48:02,260
you know?
Right.

1081
00:48:02,370 --> 00:48:04,230
That's what they're there for.
Yeah.

1082
00:48:04,300 --> 00:48:05,440
You know,
Cook it.

1083
00:48:05,790 --> 00:48:10,790
I don't know what cocaine's like,
but I know that I've had never stopped 

1084
00:48:10,790 --> 00:48:11,380
talking.
You talked about this,

1085
00:48:12,730 --> 00:48:17,730
you would be talking so fast,
your jaw would fly off and hit somebody 

1086
00:48:17,730 --> 00:48:17,730
in the face.
I have this

1087
00:48:17,730 --> 00:48:22,310
think called Martin the coca and it's a,
it's a tea that's made out of a,

1088
00:48:22,880 --> 00:48:24,990
I guess I'm talking to myself and our 
company,

1089
00:48:25,190 --> 00:48:30,190
you,
Monte to coco is a tea that's made out 

1090
00:48:30,190 --> 00:48:31,490
of a coca leaf.
So it's like cocaine,

1091
00:48:31,610 --> 00:48:34,580
the plant that they make cocaine from,
but it's the unprocessed forum,

1092
00:48:34,820 --> 00:48:35,540
which is,
um,

1093
00:48:36,090 --> 00:48:40,370
it's actually like indigenous people,
a shoe that I think it's improved.

1094
00:48:40,371 --> 00:48:42,980
They said it's like really common isn't 
approved.

1095
00:48:43,240 --> 00:48:44,840
He doesn't know he's outside smoking 
cigarettes,

1096
00:48:45,340 --> 00:48:47,360
talking to myself.
Um,

1097
00:48:47,420 --> 00:48:47,870
they,
uh,

1098
00:48:47,871 --> 00:48:50,740
they chew this leaf and it's um,
for especially the people that,

1099
00:48:50,741 --> 00:48:52,430
uh,
are at high altitude,

1100
00:48:52,700 --> 00:48:55,310
like a high altitude,
a hurting communities,

1101
00:48:55,311 --> 00:48:57,130
they,
they eat this a true.

1102
00:48:57,150 --> 00:49:02,150
This tea is tea leaf.
But I had it in a tea form and when I 

1103
00:49:02,150 --> 00:49:02,810
had it,
it was not good for me.

1104
00:49:03,050 --> 00:49:04,100
I couldn't shut the fuck up.

1105
00:49:04,100 --> 00:49:06,620
Me and Doug,
Stan hope are doing shrooms.

1106
00:49:06,830 --> 00:49:11,830
It was the day the Iraq war started and 
we were in the middle of the desert at 

1107
00:49:11,830 --> 00:49:15,971
my friend house and it's pretty crazy 
because we're truman and right when the 

1108
00:49:15,971 --> 00:49:20,411
shrooms we're kicking in,
we noticed on the television set that 

1109
00:49:20,411 --> 00:49:24,160
they were saying that the war coverage 
begins at five and Stan hope looked at 

1110
00:49:24,160 --> 00:49:26,180
me and he goes,
there's a fucking kickoff for the war.

1111
00:49:27,820 --> 00:49:29,360
I mean,
that's really what it was like they were

1112
00:49:29,361 --> 00:49:34,361
telling us when the war coverage is 
going to start tuning in at five or war 

1113
00:49:34,361 --> 00:49:34,910
coverage.
It was like a kickoff.

1114
00:49:34,940 --> 00:49:36,380
It was like,
that's when the program,

1115
00:49:36,381 --> 00:49:40,760
the war program was going to start and 
that's when this guy,

1116
00:49:40,850 --> 00:49:41,780
John,
my friend John,

1117
00:49:41,781 --> 00:49:46,781
who's like,
he's done more psychedelics than anyone 

1118
00:49:46,781 --> 00:49:46,781
I've ever met ever.
He's definitely probably fried.

1119
00:49:46,781 --> 00:49:48,240
His brains.
Got a cool podcast though.

1120
00:49:48,540 --> 00:49:50,990
Uh,
but he was talking about,

1121
00:49:50,991 --> 00:49:53,030
hey,
take this motto to Coco.

1122
00:49:53,031 --> 00:49:55,790
It'll help the mushrooms kick in 
quicker.

1123
00:49:56,600 --> 00:49:57,760
Maybe it did,
but I,

1124
00:49:57,890 --> 00:50:02,240
I could not shut the fuck up.
And I was telling Doug while I was doing

1125
00:50:02,241 --> 00:50:02,540
it,
I was like,

1126
00:50:02,541 --> 00:50:07,541
I can't shut the fuck up.
This is driving me crazy and he was 

1127
00:50:07,541 --> 00:50:10,690
laughing uncontrollably because he 
thought it was hilarious that I was 

1128
00:50:10,690 --> 00:50:11,600
talking about how I couldn't shut the 
fuck up yet aware of it,

1129
00:50:11,601 --> 00:50:11,680
and

1130
00:50:12,390 --> 00:50:14,590
it's the worst,
but you know what you would you would.

1131
00:50:14,640 --> 00:50:19,640
That's one of those drugs that,
thank God he never tried because you 

1132
00:50:19,640 --> 00:50:22,221
would freak out and love it because it 
makes your mind open up and just think 

1133
00:50:22,470 --> 00:50:27,060
so clear because you're just nonstop 
thinking of new stuff.

1134
00:50:27,140 --> 00:50:28,070
Talk about.
Well,

1135
00:50:28,080 --> 00:50:33,080
that's for me.
That's how my friend Jimmy said that 

1136
00:50:33,080 --> 00:50:33,080
when we're kids,
W W with the cousin,

1137
00:50:33,080 --> 00:50:35,420
that was a problem with it.
He told me not to do it.

1138
00:50:35,480 --> 00:50:37,550
He taught you smell so bad.
Dude.

1139
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:40,360
That is so nasty.
Cigarettes are so funny.

1140
00:50:40,490 --> 00:50:45,490
Aren't they?
Kept on talking about it and daddy 

1141
00:50:45,490 --> 00:50:47,950
needed to taste.
Daddy needed to tell you can't go two 

1142
00:50:47,950 --> 00:50:48,560
hours.
He had a cigarette right when we started

1143
00:50:48,561 --> 00:50:49,990
to buy.
Oh,

1144
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:53,030
shut your fucking hole.
You had your fix.

1145
00:50:54,590 --> 00:50:58,460
How'd your goddamn fix 'em anyway,
cigarettes.

1146
00:50:58,461 --> 00:51:02,870
Bad Code and go.
You know what though?

1147
00:51:03,110 --> 00:51:08,110
What's interesting in California,
I don't know if this is in all states 

1148
00:51:08,110 --> 00:51:09,980
that have changed cigarettes to go out 
by himself now,

1149
00:51:10,100 --> 00:51:12,650
so if you don't,
if you don't hit it long enough,

1150
00:51:12,680 --> 00:51:16,370
it will just go out because of the fires
out here reading the cigarette companies

1151
00:51:16,371 --> 00:51:21,371
had to make something in a cigarette,
so if you don't hit it after a while it 

1152
00:51:21,371 --> 00:51:23,960
will go out by itself and just makes me 
what is.

1153
00:51:23,960 --> 00:51:28,280
That can't be good.
Probably doing something like that,

1154
00:51:28,281 --> 00:51:31,250
man,
they've probably made it extra addictive

1155
00:51:31,260 --> 00:51:34,430
along the way and oh well we can do 
that,

1156
00:51:34,580 --> 00:51:39,580
but unfortunately caused with psychotic 
episodes and make you fucking mortgage 

1157
00:51:39,580 --> 00:51:41,600
your house for extra cigarettes might 
start hoarding cigarettes.

1158
00:51:41,650 --> 00:51:42,230
Right.
You know,

1159
00:51:42,250 --> 00:51:47,250
if they could figure out a way to put 
something in cigarettes that would make 

1160
00:51:47,250 --> 00:51:50,570
you completely insane and have this 
insane desire to collect cigarettes.

1161
00:51:50,660 --> 00:51:52,040
Could you imagine if that started 
happening?

1162
00:51:52,041 --> 00:51:57,041
Yeah,
like a lot of black dudes collect 

1163
00:51:57,041 --> 00:51:57,041
sneakers.
They have like you go into their house,

1164
00:51:57,041 --> 00:51:58,880
I got yo MTV raps or MTV cribs rather,
you know,

1165
00:51:58,890 --> 00:52:03,890
you go in,
they have like a whole room filled with 

1166
00:52:03,890 --> 00:52:03,890
sneaker hiding or jumped from somebody.
They're junk was touched or it's,

1167
00:52:04,310 --> 00:52:08,180
it's too big and they have a horse Cox 
and they want you to look at the fuck is

1168
00:52:08,181 --> 00:52:08,870
he talking about?

1169
00:52:08,900 --> 00:52:11,810
He's like,
no,

1170
00:52:12,050 --> 00:52:17,050
they're just,
for whatever reason they're into 

1171
00:52:17,050 --> 00:52:18,940
collecting shoes.
What if people just started collecting 

1172
00:52:18,940 --> 00:52:21,701
cigarettes like according cigarettes,
like roomfuls of cigarettes and 

1173
00:52:21,701 --> 00:52:22,400
cigarette companies are like,
well,

1174
00:52:22,520 --> 00:52:24,290
you know,
we make a fantastic product.

1175
00:52:24,350 --> 00:52:26,150
We can't help other people get excited 
about it.

1176
00:52:26,151 --> 00:52:31,151
They're just excited about our product 
and we found out that they had added 

1177
00:52:31,151 --> 00:52:31,970
something to cigarettes that make people
want to hoard cigarettes.

1178
00:52:32,420 --> 00:52:35,890
They would totally do it if some fucking
scientists came up with a,

1179
00:52:35,920 --> 00:52:39,800
a formula where he could have a certain 
amount of chemicals and if you put those

1180
00:52:39,801 --> 00:52:41,300
in cigarettes,
people smoke cigarettes,

1181
00:52:41,420 --> 00:52:46,420
they would have this insatiable desire 
to collect cigarettes and buy way more 

1182
00:52:46,420 --> 00:52:50,771
than they need.
You don't think they would put that in 

1183
00:52:50,771 --> 00:52:50,771
the cigarettes?
Of course they would.

1184
00:52:50,771 --> 00:52:50,771
Fuck,
yeah,

1185
00:52:50,771 --> 00:52:51,560
they would do it.
They didn't give a fuck about you.

1186
00:52:51,740 --> 00:52:53,210
They sell shit that kills you.

1187
00:52:53,510 --> 00:52:54,620
They shit.
They don't.

1188
00:52:54,770 --> 00:52:56,480
It's not like they didn't know we didn't
know.

1189
00:52:56,481 --> 00:52:57,680
Cigarettes kill you.
Holy Shit.

1190
00:52:57,681 --> 00:52:58,730
We're going to stop.
We're sorry.

1191
00:52:58,880 --> 00:53:03,880
No cigarettes.
Kill 400 fucking million people every 

1192
00:53:03,880 --> 00:53:06,971
year and no cigarette companies have 
even thought about slowing down and no 

1193
00:53:06,971 --> 00:53:08,540
politicians have ever thought about 
banning them.

1194
00:53:08,720 --> 00:53:10,730
You never hear a peep out of 
politicians.

1195
00:53:10,910 --> 00:53:15,910
All those faggots want to talk about 
fucking banning pot and you know we've 

1196
00:53:15,910 --> 00:53:18,230
got to stop marijuana and illegal drugs.
Meanwhile,

1197
00:53:18,231 --> 00:53:22,160
cigarettes are killing way more people 
than everything else combined.

1198
00:53:22,370 --> 00:53:23,720
Cancer,
AIDS,

1199
00:53:24,020 --> 00:53:25,920
fucking heroin,
meth,

1200
00:53:25,950 --> 00:53:27,900
coke,
all that shit.

1201
00:53:28,050 --> 00:53:32,580
Pull it all together with alcohol.
It can't put a fucking dent.

1202
00:53:32,750 --> 00:53:36,090
Not a scratch into what cigarettes kill 
every year.

1203
00:53:36,450 --> 00:53:41,450
If they could figure out a way to make 
you want to hoard cigarettes for sure 

1204
00:53:41,450 --> 00:53:42,870
they would do it and the people hoarding
it,

1205
00:53:42,871 --> 00:53:45,120
they would give testimonials.
I don't have a problem with it.

1206
00:53:45,300 --> 00:53:50,300
I enjoy my cigarette collection when I'm
walking to the garage and I look at 

1207
00:53:50,300 --> 00:53:50,430
much.
I like the smell,

1208
00:53:50,431 --> 00:53:55,431
I get out there and we're not.
I don't mean to sound like I'm smoking 

1209
00:53:55,431 --> 00:53:55,900
more.
People kind of do that,

1210
00:53:55,901 --> 00:53:57,270
but you're right,
they do do that with scratch,

1211
00:53:57,350 --> 00:54:00,930
but cigars are totally different.
They liked like savor the taste and shit

1212
00:54:00,931 --> 00:54:04,650
and it's like it makes no sense.
No different cigars or different flavors

1213
00:54:04,651 --> 00:54:05,330
to it.
They taste.

1214
00:54:05,350 --> 00:54:10,350
It tastes like shit to me.
They all taste like you're sucking on a 

1215
00:54:10,350 --> 00:54:13,971
fucking.
I Dunno a tree or something that I like 

1216
00:54:13,971 --> 00:54:13,971
them.
I'll ask the guys.

1217
00:54:13,971 --> 00:54:15,470
I think they taste good.
Really?

1218
00:54:15,471 --> 00:54:17,880
Yeah.
When you have a fat steak and a glass of

1219
00:54:17,881 --> 00:54:22,881
wine,
you get a nice Cuban cigar with a 

1220
00:54:22,881 --> 00:54:22,881
fucking good taste to it.
You know?

1221
00:54:22,881 --> 00:54:22,881
It's just like you,
you,

1222
00:54:22,910 --> 00:54:24,690
you take it in and get a good taste in 
your mouth.

1223
00:54:24,690 --> 00:54:25,560
It's fun.
Get you a little,

1224
00:54:25,561 --> 00:54:28,450
gives you a buzz.
Crazy thing.

1225
00:54:29,250 --> 00:54:31,440
I don't like spliffs because you don't 
inhale cigars.

1226
00:54:31,560 --> 00:54:36,560
You don't have to inhale through your 
mouth can you do if you're going to get 

1227
00:54:36,560 --> 00:54:36,560
high.
Now I've been.

1228
00:54:36,560 --> 00:54:37,500
The science between getting high is that
once it hits your mouth,

1229
00:54:37,530 --> 00:54:39,340
it's immediately and your stream.
You don't even know.

1230
00:54:39,341 --> 00:54:40,050
Is that true?
Yeah.

1231
00:54:40,051 --> 00:54:40,330
They,
they.

1232
00:54:40,331 --> 00:54:45,331
They did a study where it showed people 
that used to think were you supposed to 

1233
00:54:45,331 --> 00:54:46,500
inhale it and hold it in as long as you 
can.

1234
00:54:46,650 --> 00:54:50,450
I guess supposedly you get 99 percent of
the thc immediately when you.

1235
00:54:50,451 --> 00:54:52,860
When you suck it twitter verse.
Is this true?

1236
00:54:53,070 --> 00:54:55,890
Because if this is true,
I will stop smoking weed from now on and

1237
00:54:55,891 --> 00:54:58,840
I'll just put it in my mouth.
I'll just put on my off,

1238
00:54:58,900 --> 00:55:03,900
take a deep breath and then blow it out.
I always thought the people were doing 

1239
00:55:03,900 --> 00:55:03,900
that were like,
Bill,

1240
00:55:03,900 --> 00:55:05,790
I always thought that Bill Clinton did 
not inhale,

1241
00:55:05,880 --> 00:55:08,790
but it's because he was crafty.
He didn't know that.

1242
00:55:08,791 --> 00:55:11,730
He knows how science.
Is that real science?

1243
00:55:11,790 --> 00:55:16,790
It is.
Science is that real science twitter 

1244
00:55:16,790 --> 00:55:17,910
verse.
What the fuck is that true?

1245
00:55:18,360 --> 00:55:20,260
You don't.
Let's keep our googling run.

1246
00:55:20,290 --> 00:55:22,800
Love Google.
Google right now.

1247
00:55:22,920 --> 00:55:25,800
You do not have to inhale marijuana to 
get high

1248
00:55:31,130 --> 00:55:36,130
marijuana to get high.
Yeah.

1249
00:55:36,350 --> 00:55:37,200
I always thought you had to

1250
00:55:37,340 --> 00:55:40,610
hold in for the long thing to Wiki 
answers.

1251
00:55:40,910 --> 00:55:45,050
What if you do not inhale marijuana?
Answer?

1252
00:55:45,230 --> 00:55:50,230
No.
It has to go into your lungs to get you 

1253
00:55:50,230 --> 00:55:50,230
a high meaning.
You have to inhale to get hot.

1254
00:55:50,230 --> 00:55:54,580
Well,
I'm not going to listen to this stupid 

1255
00:55:54,580 --> 00:55:55,760
fuck because this stupid fuck spelled 
high two different times and then wrote,

1256
00:55:55,761 --> 00:55:59,330
have in capital letters.
Not very scientific faggot.

1257
00:55:59,540 --> 00:56:01,070
Next truck.
Here's a trend.

1258
00:56:01,280 --> 00:56:04,970
Do you have to inhale when smoking weed?
Yahoo answers.

1259
00:56:05,870 --> 00:56:08,040
Don't do it.
Best Answer.

1260
00:56:08,041 --> 00:56:10,990
Chosen by asking her.
You fucking dummy.

1261
00:56:11,460 --> 00:56:16,460
The girl says don't do it,
but if you must know you have to keep 

1262
00:56:16,461 --> 00:56:20,150
this smoke in your loans longer than you
normally would a cigarette,

1263
00:56:20,270 --> 00:56:24,460
so you inhale it and then keep it in 
there for as long as you then exhale.

1264
00:56:24,461 --> 00:56:26,140
That's not true.
That's not true.

1265
00:56:26,290 --> 00:56:29,860
It's just dumped to a don't do it.
Why Alyssa?

1266
00:56:29,920 --> 00:56:33,190
Because you don't want to have fun.
Why should he not smoke the pot?

1267
00:56:33,280 --> 00:56:38,280
Because he doesn't want to be friendly 
because he doesn't want to be more 

1268
00:56:38,280 --> 00:56:39,190
sensitive because you want it doesn't 
want to tune into the universe more.

1269
00:56:39,850 --> 00:56:42,670
Shut the fuck up.
Don't do it.

1270
00:56:44,990 --> 00:56:48,230
You can't tell me not smoke pot because 
I'm a goddamn comedian.

1271
00:56:48,380 --> 00:56:51,230
And that's like telling a basketball 
player to not play with basketballs.

1272
00:56:53,810 --> 00:56:56,880
Um,
I can't find the answer.

1273
00:56:57,000 --> 00:56:58,700
Shit.
I forget where I read it.

1274
00:56:58,701 --> 00:57:03,701
I read it somewhere.
It was like you read it the same way I 

1275
00:57:03,701 --> 00:57:05,510
place.
I've read that gold is the same amount 

1276
00:57:05,510 --> 00:57:07,490
as we know now because I,
I was on your side where that's bullshit

1277
00:57:07,520 --> 00:57:09,980
in my girlfriend who is going to school 
for nursing.

1278
00:57:10,190 --> 00:57:11,570
She's like,
that's totally untrue.

1279
00:57:11,571 --> 00:57:13,040
And then she showed me all these 
studies.

1280
00:57:13,041 --> 00:57:13,820
I'm like,
oh,

1281
00:57:13,821 --> 00:57:15,170
okay.
It was a,

1282
00:57:16,520 --> 00:57:18,970
you have to.
If she's watching get high.

1283
00:57:19,960 --> 00:57:24,960
Let's say this guys,
you need to fully inhale and to get 

1284
00:57:24,960 --> 00:57:26,200
high.
Take a big breath in.

1285
00:57:26,240 --> 00:57:28,450
See,
these are people like fucking just like

1286
00:57:29,990 --> 00:57:31,960
you have to inhale,
weeding your lungs get higher,

1287
00:57:31,961 --> 00:57:34,480
won't do anything.
We'd does not cause cancer.

1288
00:57:34,481 --> 00:57:36,880
Okay.
This guy's got a cancer article when our

1289
00:57:36,881 --> 00:57:38,440
trunk is about you.
Fuck.

1290
00:57:40,450 --> 00:57:43,320
All right.
We have no correct answer.

1291
00:57:43,330 --> 00:57:44,680
Ladies and gentlemen,
we tried.

1292
00:57:44,920 --> 00:57:48,640
We cannot find the answer to this.
Yahoo answers are all written by 16 year

1293
00:57:48,641 --> 00:57:52,330
olds or 40 year old retards.
One or the other.

1294
00:57:53,540 --> 00:57:58,540
This guy says he knows everything about 
cannabis more than seven seconds or 

1295
00:57:58,540 --> 00:57:58,790
these yahoo answers.
Yeah.

1296
00:57:58,791 --> 00:58:00,470
We looked at those yahoo answers,
man.

1297
00:58:00,471 --> 00:58:01,490
That doesn't mean shit.

1298
00:58:02,570 --> 00:58:07,570
It's something about your.
Your mouth is filled with a whatever the

1299
00:58:08,390 --> 00:58:12,410
makes sense because you don't inhale.
I'm a tobacco smoke.

1300
00:58:12,620 --> 00:58:15,260
When you smoke a cigar and you get high 
as fuck,

1301
00:58:15,590 --> 00:58:20,590
you get really high from cigars.
Cigars give you like a serious nicotine 

1302
00:58:20,590 --> 00:58:21,020
rush,
like,

1303
00:58:21,040 --> 00:58:22,430
whew,
that's a good one.

1304
00:58:22,670 --> 00:58:24,590
And if that's,
if that happens,

1305
00:58:24,730 --> 00:58:26,670
why wouldn't that happen with marijuana 
to you know,

1306
00:58:26,720 --> 00:58:31,720
you don't inhale the cigar smoke.
You take into your mouth and then you 

1307
00:58:31,720 --> 00:58:34,481
blow it out.
You don't take a deep head of it like 

1308
00:58:34,481 --> 00:58:34,481
you do with cigarettes.

1309
00:58:36,040 --> 00:58:36,670
Yeah.
That's a,

1310
00:58:36,730 --> 00:58:39,940
that's a tough google search and I'll 
have to just actually find that.

1311
00:58:40,330 --> 00:58:41,890
We don't know.
We don't know.

1312
00:58:41,891 --> 00:58:46,891
Ladies and gentlemen,
it was a recent article that was about 

1313
00:58:46,891 --> 00:58:46,891
six months ago.
I write it some people weed is not

1314
00:58:46,891 --> 00:58:48,500
for them.
That really is true,

1315
00:58:48,740 --> 00:58:53,740
you know,
like standing hope doesn't like we'd 

1316
00:58:53,740 --> 00:58:56,300
stand will pay tweet,
which doesn't make any sense because he 

1317
00:58:56,300 --> 00:58:58,781
likes everything else,
but I think he probably got too high to 

1318
00:58:58,781 --> 00:59:00,890
get paranoid.
If you get too high we will fucking rock

1319
00:59:00,891 --> 00:59:01,730
your world,
man.

1320
00:59:01,940 --> 00:59:03,020
Shit makes you really.

1321
00:59:03,400 --> 00:59:06,190
The last year see I was and I was 
tripping my ass off.

1322
00:59:06,191 --> 00:59:07,960
I almost had to run out.
I was thinking like,

1323
00:59:07,961 --> 00:59:12,961
okay,
I am just going to leave and go to my 

1324
00:59:12,961 --> 00:59:12,961
room and take a nap.

1325
00:59:12,961 --> 00:59:14,790
Because I was trying to hard from we'd.
Wow,

1326
00:59:14,791 --> 00:59:19,791
this is this rivalry says opium trivia.
The term are you hip comes from opium 

1327
00:59:20,401 --> 00:59:22,580
dens.
You would lay on your side,

1328
00:59:22,610 --> 00:59:25,070
on your hip and smoke.
Hence the term.

1329
00:59:25,130 --> 00:59:30,130
Are you hip?
That kind of makes sense because if you 

1330
00:59:30,130 --> 00:59:32,141
ever watched like those old western 
movies are dudes are doing heroin or 

1331
00:59:32,141 --> 00:59:32,330
opium.
The online on their side.

1332
00:59:32,780 --> 00:59:35,200
Like what was that movie where Wyatt 
earp?

1333
00:59:35,270 --> 00:59:40,270
Was it wider?
One of those was buffalo bill or wider 

1334
00:59:40,270 --> 00:59:40,730
thing.
It was.

1335
00:59:41,600 --> 00:59:42,950
I don't remember who the fuck played 
them.

1336
00:59:43,550 --> 00:59:44,570
Well remember,
um,

1337
00:59:44,960 --> 00:59:49,960
what was the moving where a doc holliday
one was fucking Dennis Quaid played.

1338
00:59:51,681 --> 00:59:56,681
Um,
Dennis Quaid played Wyatt earp and Val 

1339
00:59:58,130 --> 01:00:03,130
kilmer played.
Doc Holiday was the dopest doc holiday 

1340
01:00:03,130 --> 01:00:04,620
before Val kilmer just ate everything 
that,

1341
01:00:04,850 --> 01:00:07,680
that existed.
Val kilmer dissolve fat.

1342
01:00:07,700 --> 01:00:09,230
Fucked up now.
He was like,

1343
01:00:09,520 --> 01:00:11,010
go back to top gun days.

1344
01:00:11,280 --> 01:00:12,350
Tombstone,
tombstone.

1345
01:00:12,380 --> 01:00:14,470
That's it.
We go back to like val kilmer,

1346
01:00:14,480 --> 01:00:17,480
like the old days val kilmer is a 
handsome motherfucker,

1347
01:00:18,090 --> 01:00:19,000
you know?
Yeah.

1348
01:00:19,220 --> 01:00:21,350
You started hanging out with Tom 
Sizemore and you know,

1349
01:00:21,351 --> 01:00:26,351
this whole weed thing.
We could just fucking next time we're 

1350
01:00:26,351 --> 01:00:26,351
sober.
Well,

1351
01:00:26,351 --> 01:00:26,710
just try it.
Ooh,

1352
01:00:27,020 --> 01:00:27,470
okay.
Leave.

1353
01:00:27,520 --> 01:00:29,210
This guy says,
red band is right.

1354
01:00:29,270 --> 01:00:30,320
Arrowhead.
Here we go.

1355
01:00:30,620 --> 01:00:32,840
Robberies comes,
comes clean our.

1356
01:00:32,930 --> 01:00:36,470
Here we go.
Read it to us.

1357
01:00:36,710 --> 01:00:37,430
Okay,
here it is.

1358
01:00:37,700 --> 01:00:42,700
Mouse smoking cannabis.
One of the primary health issues with 

1359
01:00:42,700 --> 01:00:42,700
cannabis is the effect of smuggled the 
lungs.

1360
01:00:42,700 --> 01:00:47,501
While the risks from longterm cannabis 
smoking or not fully understood is 

1361
01:00:47,501 --> 01:00:48,290
assumed by.
Before I do this,

1362
01:00:48,440 --> 01:00:51,830
I will tell.
I will take this copy,

1363
01:00:52,190 --> 01:00:57,190
mount smoking is not as efficient as 
long smoking and requires approximately 

1364
01:00:57,190 --> 01:01:00,500
three times the material for the same 
level of effect,

1365
01:01:00,680 --> 01:01:03,320
but for some people efficiency is not an
issue.

1366
01:01:03,620 --> 01:01:05,600
I would say it's not an issue,
you know,

1367
01:01:05,610 --> 01:01:10,610
because we.
It's not that expensive as we were 

1368
01:01:10,610 --> 01:01:10,610
talking about how it's worth a lot of 
money because.

1369
01:01:10,610 --> 01:01:12,470
But it's not worth it.
It's not that much.

1370
01:01:12,471 --> 01:01:15,620
I mean it's one marijuana joint is like 
what is it,

1371
01:01:15,621 --> 01:01:18,740
like $10 or something like that and 
probably wasn't.

1372
01:01:18,850 --> 01:01:20,900
How much is a joint it joint?
$10.

1373
01:01:21,050 --> 01:01:24,950
$10.
California joint will fast for sure.

1374
01:01:24,980 --> 01:01:27,660
Fuck you out of your mind joining.
Even if you're.

1375
01:01:28,010 --> 01:01:32,240
Even if you smoke a lot,
if you actually inhaled a full joint,

1376
01:01:32,241 --> 01:01:34,340
you would be blitzkrieg,
California weed,

1377
01:01:34,430 --> 01:01:39,430
California Wade.
So if you take California weed and you 

1378
01:01:39,430 --> 01:01:39,430
mouth mouth,
fuck it.

1379
01:01:39,950 --> 01:01:44,950
You could probably get by on like two 
hits of California weed from a joint and

1380
01:01:45,651 --> 01:01:46,780
you're gone.
And when.

1381
01:01:46,880 --> 01:01:51,880
One of the things that you could do also
is if you inhale it and you breathe it 

1382
01:01:51,880 --> 01:01:52,150
out your nose,
so you,

1383
01:01:52,360 --> 01:01:54,800
you put it in your mouth and then you 
blow it out your notes,

1384
01:01:54,801 --> 01:01:57,980
but you're not going hailing it if it 
even increases it.

1385
01:01:58,250 --> 01:02:03,250
Alright,
well let's post this up online just so 

1386
01:02:03,250 --> 01:02:03,250
everybody knows what the fuck we're 
reading.

1387
01:02:03,250 --> 01:02:04,040
Yeah.
But I used to.

1388
01:02:04,160 --> 01:02:08,970
I remember there was somebody I used to 
know that like smoke,

1389
01:02:09,050 --> 01:02:10,680
she would only smoke with me,
but she would say,

1390
01:02:10,681 --> 01:02:15,681
I'm not going to inhale it,
but I'll smoke it with you and make you 

1391
01:02:15,681 --> 01:02:15,681
feel better.
I'm like,

1392
01:02:15,681 --> 01:02:19,810
okay,
so see if she would always get fucked 

1393
01:02:19,810 --> 01:02:19,810
up.
And I'm like,

1394
01:02:19,810 --> 01:02:20,310
wow,
she's not stoned,

1395
01:02:20,340 --> 01:02:25,340
but why is he acting so fucked up?
So I look back at it now when she was 

1396
01:02:25,340 --> 01:02:25,340
locked up,

1397
01:02:28,680 --> 01:02:30,330
I just put that shit up online

1398
01:02:32,380 --> 01:02:34,540
so you can twitter that.
They have a.

1399
01:02:35,010 --> 01:02:36,890
So now we learned something ladies,
gentlemen,

1400
01:02:38,020 --> 01:02:39,520
rivalries,
rivalries,

1401
01:02:39,521 --> 01:02:40,420
you know,
a lot of drugs,

1402
01:02:40,421 --> 01:02:42,070
motherfucker.
This is the dude.

1403
01:02:42,310 --> 01:02:45,290
He runs the whole thing.
It's says he,

1404
01:02:45,291 --> 01:02:47,920
uh,
he owns a pool hall in um,

1405
01:02:48,400 --> 01:02:50,440
uh,
somewhere in Georgia.

1406
01:02:51,080 --> 01:02:54,450
Forget where it's from,
make them make them Georgia,

1407
01:02:54,451 --> 01:02:56,410
I believe,
but it's a pretty famous pool hall.

1408
01:02:56,440 --> 01:02:58,010
This guy owns it.
Lights everything.

1409
01:02:58,050 --> 01:03:03,050
Douche squad.
There was a bunch of dudes with the 

1410
01:03:03,050 --> 01:03:03,050
Dishwasher,
you know,

1411
01:03:03,050 --> 01:03:06,210
some,
some members of my board break off into 

1412
01:03:06,210 --> 01:03:06,210
little separate sex,
like little gangs.

1413
01:03:06,330 --> 01:03:08,980
I don't know what they're doing if 
you've never been to my message board.

1414
01:03:08,981 --> 01:03:12,610
I got the craziest message board.
I don't know how the fuck it happened.

1415
01:03:12,640 --> 01:03:14,770
I don't know what caused it.
But,

1416
01:03:14,830 --> 01:03:19,830
uh,
I've had this nutty message board since 

1417
01:03:19,830 --> 01:03:22,860
1998 and right now there is more than 
two and a half million posts on it.

1418
01:03:25,820 --> 01:03:26,930
I'll put it up online.

1419
01:03:33,560 --> 01:03:38,360
I started smoking when I was 15 ray and 
uh,

1420
01:03:38,361 --> 01:03:39,110
anyway,
um,

1421
01:03:39,290 --> 01:03:44,290
this message board,
there's so much fucking nutty shit on 

1422
01:03:44,290 --> 01:03:45,560
that board.
That's how I met Brian.

1423
01:03:45,790 --> 01:03:48,800
I met Brian from the message board.
It's really got a life of its own.

1424
01:03:48,801 --> 01:03:53,801
I mean,
it's got my name attached to it and I 

1425
01:03:53,801 --> 01:03:53,801
pay for it and to keep it running and 
you know,

1426
01:03:53,801 --> 01:03:58,750
but there's like a bunch of different 
dudes who are cool people that I've met 

1427
01:03:58,750 --> 01:04:03,400
in real life,
most of them that are the moderators on 

1428
01:04:03,400 --> 01:04:06,170
the board and you know,
it's anything fucked up in the world.

1429
01:04:06,230 --> 01:04:07,910
Anything weird,
crazy,

1430
01:04:08,080 --> 01:04:10,790
any nutty news.
If you're looking for a video,

1431
01:04:10,791 --> 01:04:14,600
like I heard this is a crazy video out,
my board is going to happen for sure.

1432
01:04:14,601 --> 01:04:15,890
Right?
When you say that's,

1433
01:04:16,450 --> 01:04:18,170
you know,
it's a crazy place.

1434
01:04:18,510 --> 01:04:21,470
It's pretty nutty ladies gentlemen.
And on that note,

1435
01:04:21,500 --> 01:04:22,820
it's fucking 5:36.

1436
01:04:23,180 --> 01:04:24,440
That's two hours,
two and a half hours.

1437
01:04:25,370 --> 01:04:27,400
We can't do more than two hours.
Folks Boring.

1438
01:04:27,890 --> 01:04:31,520
But we're at the Addison Texas Improv 
this weekend,

1439
01:04:31,670 --> 01:04:34,430
Friday,
Saturday and Sunday.

1440
01:04:34,730 --> 01:04:37,820
And I want to take a link right here,
motherfucker.

1441
01:04:38,030 --> 01:04:43,030
And I'm going to open this bitch and I'm
going to put that on twitter so 

1442
01:04:43,030 --> 01:04:43,790
everybody knows what's up.
Almost sold out.

1443
01:04:43,850 --> 01:04:45,830
Yeah.
It is very close to sold out.

1444
01:04:45,831 --> 01:04:48,650
Like all the shows went about Houston,
like Houston.

1445
01:04:48,651 --> 01:04:50,870
People wondering if you're coming back 
to him coming back.

1446
01:04:51,020 --> 01:04:56,020
We're right now trying to figure out 
whether we're doing the Improv or 

1447
01:04:56,020 --> 01:04:58,751
whether we're doing the house of Blues.
There was a problem with the House of 

1448
01:04:58,751 --> 01:05:00,080
blues initially where they said the 
house of blues could not a seat.

1449
01:05:00,081 --> 01:05:05,081
Everybody and I did not want to do a 
show where people have to stand and we 

1450
01:05:05,081 --> 01:05:07,070
talked about this before that we went to
the Doug Stanhope show when he was in la

1451
01:05:07,071 --> 01:05:11,210
and I love Doug,
but I fucking can't stand and just watch

1452
01:05:11,211 --> 01:05:13,190
a show for an hour and a half.
It's hurts your feet.

1453
01:05:13,370 --> 01:05:14,690
Your back starts hurting,
your neck,

1454
01:05:14,691 --> 01:05:19,691
gets cramped up,
and then I realized like this is 

1455
01:05:19,691 --> 01:05:19,691
uncomfortable.
Sitting and watching a show is awesome,

1456
01:05:19,780 --> 01:05:22,600
but standing and watching a show sucks.
It gets annoying.

1457
01:05:22,910 --> 01:05:27,910
Not a big fan of the house of Blues.
I wanted to see a concert last week and 

1458
01:05:27,910 --> 01:05:30,540
I had a horrible experience with those 
fuckers with House of Blues.

1459
01:05:30,570 --> 01:05:32,130
Which one though?
They went on sunset.

1460
01:05:32,220 --> 01:05:33,930
What happened?
Uh,

1461
01:05:34,710 --> 01:05:36,500
when you go through,
they stamp your hands.

1462
01:05:36,501 --> 01:05:38,910
They quit wristbands on.
They check your ids.

1463
01:05:38,911 --> 01:05:40,440
They scan the tickets,
right,

1464
01:05:40,830 --> 01:05:43,560
so we went up there and it was general 
admission.

1465
01:05:43,620 --> 01:05:47,430
We found a place that we wanted to like 
sit and stay lean up against the wall.

1466
01:05:47,431 --> 01:05:51,360
It was perfect for the concert.
Halfway through the opening,

1467
01:05:51,430 --> 01:05:53,610
a act or whatever,
opening band,

1468
01:05:54,030 --> 01:05:56,850
security grabbed my girlfriend coming 
out of the bathroom goes,

1469
01:05:56,851 --> 01:05:58,050
where's your hand stamp?
And she goes,

1470
01:05:58,110 --> 01:05:59,430
oh,
I don't know,

1471
01:05:59,431 --> 01:06:01,830
maybe it washed off.
I have a wristband.

1472
01:06:01,860 --> 01:06:03,600
Here's my ticket.
She goes,

1473
01:06:03,601 --> 01:06:04,800
no,
your hands not stamped.

1474
01:06:04,830 --> 01:06:06,240
You're Outta here.
And she's like,

1475
01:06:06,270 --> 01:06:07,590
well,
I have my ticket right here.

1476
01:06:07,620 --> 01:06:08,160
He goes,
I don't care.

1477
01:06:08,161 --> 01:06:09,630
He's going to have a hand stamp.
She goes,

1478
01:06:09,660 --> 01:06:11,490
my boyfriend's right there.
He goes,

1479
01:06:11,580 --> 01:06:13,300
go get him.
And he's kicked out too.

1480
01:06:13,950 --> 01:06:15,160
Like it was like,
it was like,

1481
01:06:15,240 --> 01:06:16,260
what are you?
Okay,

1482
01:06:16,261 --> 01:06:19,770
but that's just la douchebag.
A manager got involved.

1483
01:06:19,830 --> 01:06:21,690
Right?
But that has nothing to do with Houston,

1484
01:06:21,691 --> 01:06:26,510
Texas or a company dickheads.
He's like,

1485
01:06:26,570 --> 01:06:27,810
sorry,
corporate policy,

1486
01:06:27,811 --> 01:06:29,340
you're supposed to get hand stamped.
I'm like,

1487
01:06:29,520 --> 01:06:30,810
it doesn't matter.
I'm in here.

1488
01:06:30,811 --> 01:06:32,890
I have tickets with a fucking manager.
He goes,

1489
01:06:32,910 --> 01:06:34,420
I'm sorry,
but let's go downstairs,

1490
01:06:34,470 --> 01:06:37,200
which get your hand stamp and let's 
figure this out together.

1491
01:06:37,201 --> 01:06:42,201
I'm like the concerts on right now.
It's just like the biggest fucking 

1492
01:06:42,201 --> 01:06:42,510
corporate bullshit.
You know?

1493
01:06:42,511 --> 01:06:44,640
That shit wouldn't happen at fucking 
Improv.

1494
01:06:44,700 --> 01:06:45,660
You don't think so?
No.

1495
01:06:45,720 --> 01:06:47,250
You don't have your hand stamped.
You have a ticket.

1496
01:06:47,251 --> 01:06:47,640
Come on.

1497
01:06:48,220 --> 01:06:53,220
So you think that death.
So what happened then you think would 

1498
01:06:53,220 --> 01:06:56,401
not happen.
So you think that if we have a show at 

1499
01:06:56,401 --> 01:06:56,401
the house of Blues,
people might get fucked.

1500
01:06:56,401 --> 01:06:57,950
My problem with the House of Blues,
it's a corporate thing,

1501
01:06:58,010 --> 01:07:00,680
the whole not being able to make great 
fucking time at all.

1502
01:07:00,681 --> 01:07:02,870
The House of Blues.
Well you have anytime when you're out in

1503
01:07:02,871 --> 01:07:04,520
front of a,
a good crowd of people,

1504
01:07:04,521 --> 01:07:04,970
right?
Yeah,

1505
01:07:04,971 --> 01:07:07,550
but that's one of the few venues where 
you guarantee that everything's going to

1506
01:07:07,551 --> 01:07:08,770
run smoothly.
You know,

1507
01:07:08,780 --> 01:07:11,930
they get rid of douchebags in the 
audience to record your own.

1508
01:07:11,940 --> 01:07:16,940
Say That is true.
Now that fans aren't allowed to bring 

1509
01:07:16,940 --> 01:07:18,340
cameras into the place or they have to 
leave them at the box on.

1510
01:07:18,610 --> 01:07:19,800
Well,
the problem with that,

1511
01:07:19,801 --> 01:07:24,801
as these motherfuckers want to stick 
cameras in your face while you're on 

1512
01:07:24,801 --> 01:07:24,930
stage,
constantly record things and put them on

1513
01:07:24,931 --> 01:07:29,931
youtube,
they're going to do that with various 

1514
01:07:29,931 --> 01:07:31,540
very district going to do that 
regardless of what it is annoying for 

1515
01:07:31,540 --> 01:07:31,570
them and for the bands and for different
people.

1516
01:07:31,571 --> 01:07:33,720
I feel like you don't want their stuff 
pirated.

1517
01:07:33,930 --> 01:07:36,060
They're just protecting the artists.
That make sense to me.

1518
01:07:36,210 --> 01:07:39,210
I agree,
but it's not a bad experience.

1519
01:07:39,330 --> 01:07:44,330
But I think he had isolated Douche bags.
I mean people that run the House of 

1520
01:07:44,330 --> 01:07:45,960
Blues and I'm in Vegas are fucking 
awesome.

1521
01:07:45,990 --> 01:07:48,900
The those people are super cool and 
that's the one we go to the most.

1522
01:07:48,950 --> 01:07:50,760
Yeah.
House of Blues and San Diego.

1523
01:07:50,800 --> 01:07:54,200
Then we also knew it wasn't performance 
side night a customers.

1524
01:07:54,201 --> 01:07:56,010
That's true.
I've never heard any complaints.

1525
01:07:56,011 --> 01:07:59,250
So if you guys have had complaints about
the house of Blues,

1526
01:07:59,520 --> 01:08:01,800
let a Nigga know.
You know I need to.

1527
01:08:02,250 --> 01:08:07,250
I need to hear that shit.
Maybe Dan Ackroyd's house of Blues in 

1528
01:08:07,250 --> 01:08:11,490
Connecticut at the Mohegan Sun deal fell
through gigantic fail.

1529
01:08:11,820 --> 01:08:15,710
Why don't I read that?
You fucking

1530
01:08:16,460 --> 01:08:19,850
motherfucker house of Blues charges a 
buttload that is true.

1531
01:08:20,150 --> 01:08:22,880
They have a lot of built in costs.
It costs.

1532
01:08:22,940 --> 01:08:27,940
I get paid the same amount to do a 300 
seat room in Vegas as I do to do the 

1533
01:08:27,940 --> 01:08:30,020
house of Blues,
which is like 900 seats,

1534
01:08:30,200 --> 01:08:32,370
which is pretty crazy.
Yeah.

1535
01:08:32,500 --> 01:08:34,760
That's kind of fucked up because they 
have all these built in.

1536
01:08:34,810 --> 01:08:37,250
Um,
they have built in costs

1537
01:08:37,830 --> 01:08:40,720
in pockets.
Oh Shit.

1538
01:08:40,750 --> 01:08:42,940
Built in pockets in their prices.
That's another thing.

1539
01:08:42,941 --> 01:08:47,941
The prices were ridiculous.
Like a bud light with six bucks or 

1540
01:08:47,941 --> 01:08:47,941
something like that.

1541
01:08:47,941 --> 01:08:48,610
Is it really?
Where is it?

1542
01:08:48,850 --> 01:08:49,960
What is it?
Most bars,

1543
01:08:50,350 --> 01:08:51,760
but like,
usually,

1544
01:08:51,761 --> 01:08:55,660
I mean outside of Los Angeles,
usually it's like three bucks,

1545
01:08:55,661 --> 01:08:57,670
two bucks for a bud light outside of Los
Angeles.

1546
01:08:58,860 --> 01:09:00,910
Los Angeles.
Under five hours at least.

1547
01:09:01,800 --> 01:09:02,460
Easily.
Okay.

1548
01:09:02,461 --> 01:09:05,040
Well someone just fucking bitch slap 
rivalries.

1549
01:09:05,400 --> 01:09:08,070
BBJ Joan says that Shit,
we said about hip.

1550
01:09:08,100 --> 01:09:11,700
The opium dens.
He says the actual

1551
01:09:11,710 --> 01:09:13,780
or is

1552
01:09:14,620 --> 01:09:19,620
two and the answer of A.
Are you hip being opium dens lying on?

1553
01:09:21,020 --> 01:09:22,520
He says it's not true.
It's not true.

1554
01:09:22,521 --> 01:09:23,750
It says,
to ingenious,

1555
01:09:23,751 --> 01:09:27,290
too convoluted and too silly,
is wiki 44,

1556
01:09:27,291 --> 01:09:32,291
but that's Wiki.
This is his opinion is often a great 

1557
01:09:32,291 --> 01:09:35,561
deal of uncertainty and tracking word 
origins since we have written worked 

1558
01:09:35,561 --> 01:09:39,330
record going phrase may have been in 
common use long before anybody wrote it 

1559
01:09:39,330 --> 01:09:42,911
down after all,
one doesn't use slang phrases in most 

1560
01:09:42,911 --> 01:09:42,911
writing,
such as newspaper,

1561
01:09:42,911 --> 01:09:45,590
a certain competence accepted.
They should use slang and everything.

1562
01:09:46,220 --> 01:09:48,950
So talk while we pretend to not talk the
way we talk,

1563
01:09:49,280 --> 01:09:51,380
I always thought that like writing 
professionally,

1564
01:09:51,381 --> 01:09:54,040
like when I write my blogs,
I read exactly the way I talk.

1565
01:09:54,170 --> 01:09:56,270
I'm just like,
I wrote an open letter to Kellogg's,

1566
01:09:56,510 --> 01:09:58,580
which more or less I did as a writing 
exercise.

1567
01:09:58,581 --> 01:10:02,630
I was writing every day.
I'm from month to month.

1568
01:10:02,630 --> 01:10:05,720
My Spike TV special was being recorded.
So I wrote down,

1569
01:10:05,930 --> 01:10:08,210
I wrote my material out every day.
Uh,

1570
01:10:08,230 --> 01:10:13,230
I wrote not wrote down material.
I wrote new blogs every day and you 

1571
01:10:13,230 --> 01:10:13,230
know,
I just needed to shit to write about.

1572
01:10:13,230 --> 01:10:15,650
And one of them was this Kellogg's 
banning Michael Phelps because he smoked

1573
01:10:15,651 --> 01:10:17,810
weed because I wrote this open letter 
and I wrote it.

1574
01:10:17,811 --> 01:10:20,900
The way I talk with swears and just the 
way I normally talk people look,

1575
01:10:21,090 --> 01:10:24,260
they're going to read that open letter.
Like I didn't want him to read a stupid.

1576
01:10:24,530 --> 01:10:25,910
I'm just writing.
It doesn't.

1577
01:10:26,210 --> 01:10:29,300
You could read it or you don't read it,
but I'm not gonna write something you to

1578
01:10:29,330 --> 01:10:31,790
have more impact.
Just like they're going to listen.

1579
01:10:32,090 --> 01:10:34,130
They're going to listen to a fucking 
pothead,

1580
01:10:34,131 --> 01:10:39,131
comedian slash cage fighting commentator
like Kellogg's is gonna make their 

1581
01:10:39,131 --> 01:10:39,560
decisions based on that.
No,

1582
01:10:39,590 --> 01:10:41,450
it's for you guys.
It's for humor.

1583
01:10:41,451 --> 01:10:46,451
It's for entertainment.
Does the word hip really hit heal from a

1584
01:10:47,941 --> 01:10:52,000
west African language?
It could be either or though this,

1585
01:10:52,260 --> 01:10:54,050
this.
I mean it could be that,

1586
01:10:54,120 --> 01:10:59,120
that the,
the original hip that rivalries talks 

1587
01:10:59,120 --> 01:10:59,120
about is right.
I mean there's,

1588
01:10:59,120 --> 01:11:00,630
I mean if,
if there's no real.

1589
01:11:01,670 --> 01:11:04,640
If the origins of it are or are murky,
it could.

1590
01:11:04,670 --> 01:11:09,670
It could be both.
They're just not saying anything to 

1591
01:11:09,670 --> 01:11:09,670
discredit that

1592
01:11:09,670 --> 01:11:10,840
anyone who gives a fuck

1593
01:11:11,250 --> 01:11:15,210
red band is totally right about the Oh,
is he really,

1594
01:11:15,990 --> 01:11:16,860
truly right?

1595
01:11:17,070 --> 01:11:18,800
I am telling her I.
No,

1596
01:11:18,880 --> 01:11:20,190
no,
it's a fucking taste thing.

1597
01:11:20,191 --> 01:11:25,191
I think cigarettes are disgusting and 
you're sucking on them everyday because 

1598
01:11:25,191 --> 01:11:25,610
you wouldn't think they're discussing if
you smoke them for when.

1599
01:11:25,660 --> 01:11:28,620
You're totally right about that.
You're right.

1600
01:11:28,680 --> 01:11:33,680
If I was a junkie,
I wouldn't think they're just kind of 

1601
01:11:33,680 --> 01:11:33,680
stuff.

1602
01:11:33,680 --> 01:11:35,420
This guy had a shitty experience at the 
Anaheim House of Blues.

1603
01:11:35,540 --> 01:11:40,540
Same deal as red band,
except they had to make me restate my 

1604
01:11:40,540 --> 01:11:40,910
hand and I lost my stool.

1605
01:11:41,020 --> 01:11:42,340
Exactly.
That's what happened to me.

1606
01:11:42,760 --> 01:11:47,760
I lost my store and almost got in a 
fight with a bunch of Persians and the 

1607
01:11:47,760 --> 01:11:52,081
guy felt bad.
I felt bad and Kevin buying me a bad 

1608
01:11:52,081 --> 01:11:52,081
tequila on night and next thing I know,
I was like,

1609
01:11:52,960 --> 01:11:53,680
Bro,
alright.

1610
01:11:53,980 --> 01:11:56,690
Oh wait,
isn't that are called the compressions?

1611
01:11:56,710 --> 01:11:57,580
Iranians.
Yeah,

1612
01:11:57,590 --> 01:11:58,760
but they're.
They don't want to be caught.

1613
01:11:59,430 --> 01:12:04,430
Not.
They don't want to be confused with 

1614
01:12:04,430 --> 01:12:06,781
Irene Irania here.
Iranian talk about the fights at 1:10.

1615
01:12:08,180 --> 01:12:08,470
It was

1616
01:12:08,750 --> 01:12:11,360
fucking awesome.
Cain Velasquez,

1617
01:12:11,590 --> 01:12:13,200
the guy's a legend.
He's.

1618
01:12:13,240 --> 01:12:16,880
He's going to go down in history as one 
of the greatest ever.

1619
01:12:16,970 --> 01:12:19,940
I think that that was just some stellar 
shit.

1620
01:12:20,420 --> 01:12:23,660
Cain Velasquez going to be him against 
Brock Lesnar was going to be insane.

1621
01:12:24,440 --> 01:12:29,440
I want to see him against fate or really
I would love to see Cain Velasquez 

1622
01:12:29,440 --> 01:12:33,071
against fader.
I think every time cane fights it gets 

1623
01:12:33,071 --> 01:12:33,071
better.
You know,

1624
01:12:33,071 --> 01:12:33,830
the heavyweight division is a 
motherfucker right now,

1625
01:12:33,831 --> 01:12:38,831
Shane car wound versus Frank Meir and 
Brock Lesnar is going to fight the 

1626
01:12:38,831 --> 01:12:39,340
winter and you know,
who knows what the fuck is ever going to

1627
01:12:39,341 --> 01:12:41,210
happen to fate or fate or ever gets to 
the UFC.

1628
01:12:41,211 --> 01:12:44,030
The fucking universe might collapse.
It might be insane.

1629
01:12:44,430 --> 01:12:48,980
All Right Ladies and gentlemen,
we've had a long ass show at 5:44.

1630
01:12:49,100 --> 01:12:54,100
So that means even with our downtime,
we did like an hour and 20 minutes at 

1631
01:12:54,100 --> 01:12:54,860
least maybe an hour and a half.
Love Ya.

1632
01:12:55,250 --> 01:12:58,970
Thanks for tuning in Addison,
Texas this weekend,

1633
01:12:59,210 --> 01:13:03,440
next week or early next week.
Uh Oh,

1634
01:13:03,441 --> 01:13:05,420
Canada.
I'm in Canada next week.

1635
01:13:05,750 --> 01:13:09,200
Shazamm bitches.
I'm in Toronto.

1636
01:13:09,201 --> 01:13:11,870
I'm in a couple other places.
I don't know what the fuck I am,

1637
01:13:12,230 --> 01:13:13,760
but we'll talk about that shit next 
week.

1638
01:13:14,090 --> 01:13:16,460
Thank you very much for tuning in.
I love you bitches.

1639
01:13:16,520 --> 01:13:18,950
And um,
that's it.

1640
01:13:19,460 --> 01:13:21,110
All right.
I got to find out how to end this.

1641
01:13:21,111 --> 01:13:23,210
It would've been cooler if I figured out
a way to say thank you.

1642
01:13:23,211 --> 01:13:25,370
I love you.
Shut up.

1643
01:13:25,880 --> 01:13:26,150
Bye.
