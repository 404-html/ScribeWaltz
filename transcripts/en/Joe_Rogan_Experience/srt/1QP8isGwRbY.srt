1
00:00:03,220 --> 00:00:04,560
But you've got to fake mail now.

2
00:00:04,740 --> 00:00:05,573
You son of a bitch,

3
00:00:05,990 --> 00:00:10,620
it's supposed to be me out me out by the
way is welded into the desk of the new

4
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:12,000
studio desk,

5
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:12,721
the uh,

6
00:00:12,721 --> 00:00:13,890
the foot of the dead,

7
00:00:13,891 --> 00:00:14,880
the legs of the desk.

8
00:00:15,150 --> 00:00:17,280
I had it made constructive by an artist.

9
00:00:17,281 --> 00:00:18,114
Our friend Eric,

10
00:00:18,440 --> 00:00:22,410
he did a sick job on it and one of the
things that he did just on his own is

11
00:00:22,411 --> 00:00:25,500
write the word me out on the side.

12
00:00:25,890 --> 00:00:29,760
Cause this silly bitch says meow
at the beginning of every podcast.

13
00:00:29,761 --> 00:00:33,090
You got to appreciate the little things
in life studies and John and Brian

14
00:00:33,091 --> 00:00:34,770
brings the bizarre little things.

15
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:35,251
Just this,

16
00:00:35,251 --> 00:00:36,270
the extra flavor.

17
00:00:36,271 --> 00:00:37,560
It's a salt on the meat.

18
00:00:37,650 --> 00:00:38,221
You know what I'm saying,

19
00:00:38,221 --> 00:00:39,054
son,

20
00:00:39,690 --> 00:00:42,060
we will be in Minneapolis this weekend.

21
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:44,400
I think there's a couple of tickets left,

22
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:45,210
but it was,

23
00:00:45,210 --> 00:00:47,130
it was basically almost sold out.

24
00:00:47,450 --> 00:00:47,970
Um,

25
00:00:47,970 --> 00:00:50,130
and that is at the pantageous theater.

26
00:00:50,370 --> 00:00:52,890
It will be Joey motherfucking,

27
00:00:52,891 --> 00:00:53,970
Coco Diaz,

28
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:55,800
Brian Red band.

29
00:00:55,830 --> 00:00:59,400
And Doug Benson is also going
to stop in and do a set.

30
00:00:59,430 --> 00:01:01,110
That shit be crazy.

31
00:01:01,111 --> 00:01:01,500
Yo.

32
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:02,101
That's an awesome.

33
00:01:02,101 --> 00:01:02,970
So yeah,

34
00:01:02,971 --> 00:01:03,781
we're going to have some fun.

35
00:01:03,781 --> 00:01:06,570
We're going to have some
fun and Minneapolis is
awesome and it hasn't frozen

36
00:01:06,571 --> 00:01:07,051
over yet,

37
00:01:07,051 --> 00:01:09,150
so we're going to get to him
right before shit freezes.

38
00:01:09,270 --> 00:01:09,720
Get in,

39
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:10,553
get out.

40
00:01:11,220 --> 00:01:11,790
Boom.

41
00:01:11,790 --> 00:01:14,280
We also have a show this
Wednesday night at the Ice House,

42
00:01:14,550 --> 00:01:15,660
a 10:00 PM show.

43
00:01:15,661 --> 00:01:17,100
We're going to do these
on a regular basis.

44
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:20,280
I'm not doing it next week because
I'm going hunting like a man.

45
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:21,430
Brian Callen,

46
00:01:21,431 --> 00:01:24,180
Steve Rinella and I are
going to go deer hunting.

47
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:27,090
I'm going to earn my meat bitches or not,

48
00:01:27,091 --> 00:01:30,420
or become a Vegan free counts bitch.

49
00:01:30,660 --> 00:01:32,730
It's very possible psychedelics,

50
00:01:32,790 --> 00:01:33,623
while you're out there

51
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:35,873
listening,

52
00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:37,590
Jesus son,

53
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:39,330
Jesus.

54
00:01:39,620 --> 00:01:39,970
But uh,

55
00:01:39,970 --> 00:01:42,900
this Wednesday night it
will be a Greg Fitzsimmons,

56
00:01:43,100 --> 00:01:43,620
uh,

57
00:01:43,620 --> 00:01:44,790
Ian Edwards,

58
00:01:45,210 --> 00:01:45,780
I think.

59
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:45,961
No,

60
00:01:45,961 --> 00:01:47,100
Doug Benson can't do it.

61
00:01:47,101 --> 00:01:49,380
Hans and I saw both of those
guys at the La Pod fest.

62
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:50,820
Greg with hilarious.

63
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:51,840
Greg is always hilarious.

64
00:01:51,870 --> 00:01:52,710
He's great comic.

65
00:01:53,010 --> 00:01:56,880
Greg and I have been friends
for fucking 23 years.

66
00:01:56,910 --> 00:01:58,680
That's when we started
doing stand up together.

67
00:01:59,190 --> 00:02:00,023
He's a,

68
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:02,220
he's old school dude.

69
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:03,360
Funny as fuck though.

70
00:02:03,361 --> 00:02:04,680
He slayed that audience.

71
00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:05,101
Yeah,

72
00:02:05,101 --> 00:02:06,660
he's a fucking professional.

73
00:02:06,990 --> 00:02:07,590
Um,

74
00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:07,981
uh,

75
00:02:07,981 --> 00:02:08,550
I think,

76
00:02:08,550 --> 00:02:09,830
oh Dunkin Dunkins doing it to too.

77
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:10,531
Okay.

78
00:02:10,531 --> 00:02:10,741
So,

79
00:02:10,741 --> 00:02:11,550
hey everybody.

80
00:02:11,550 --> 00:02:12,810
So this Wednesday night at the ice house,

81
00:02:12,811 --> 00:02:14,160
it's Ian Dunk,

82
00:02:14,190 --> 00:02:14,970
Ian Edwards.

83
00:02:14,970 --> 00:02:16,230
Fucking hilarious dude.

84
00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:17,550
Duncan Trussell of course.

85
00:02:17,551 --> 00:02:17,941
Hilarious.

86
00:02:17,941 --> 00:02:18,774
Brian Redman,

87
00:02:18,810 --> 00:02:19,500
you know him,

88
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:22,270
she loves him and uh,

89
00:02:22,430 --> 00:02:22,890
uh,

90
00:02:22,890 --> 00:02:24,990
Greg motherfucking Fitzsimmons so
we're going to have a good time.

91
00:02:24,991 --> 00:02:25,651
That's 10 o'clock.

92
00:02:25,651 --> 00:02:28,590
It's 15 bucks and a we do
on a regular basis here.

93
00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:32,070
We were asked recently to
start doing everyone's day.

94
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:34,740
So it's as much as a of that as I can.

95
00:02:34,740 --> 00:02:35,910
Sometimes I'm going to be on the road,

96
00:02:36,270 --> 00:02:36,781
but uh,

97
00:02:36,781 --> 00:02:37,201
when I'm,

98
00:02:37,201 --> 00:02:40,470
when I'm in town we're going to try
to do it and just a cool place for our

99
00:02:40,471 --> 00:02:41,760
friends to go and do stand up.

100
00:02:41,761 --> 00:02:42,420
And uh,

101
00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:45,420
the guys that you'll see are all going
to be really funny guys cause uh,

102
00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:47,040
we don't hang out with my scrubs.

103
00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:48,173
Yo.

104
00:02:48,340 --> 00:02:49,173
You know what I'm saying?

105
00:02:49,770 --> 00:02:52,500
I think my fucking flap
talk really quietly.

106
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:54,580
The Joe Rogan Experience,

107
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:54,900
oh,

108
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:55,690
hi primate.

109
00:02:55,690 --> 00:02:57,210
My higher primary t shirts are into,

110
00:02:57,570 --> 00:03:00,360
if you go to higher-primate.com
people have been asked.

111
00:03:00,370 --> 00:03:02,680
I finally got all that shit taken care of.

112
00:03:02,681 --> 00:03:02,890
Look,

113
00:03:02,890 --> 00:03:04,750
I'm a fucking terrible businessman,

114
00:03:04,751 --> 00:03:04,971
ladies,

115
00:03:04,971 --> 00:03:05,870
and shut up my only about it,

116
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:07,350
but I got some dope tee shirts.

117
00:03:07,660 --> 00:03:09,250
I supposed to do my taxes today.

118
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:10,010
Whoops.

119
00:03:10,010 --> 00:03:10,480
Whoops,

120
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:12,170
though you're a terrible
business person too.

121
00:03:12,380 --> 00:03:13,213
I'm horrible.

122
00:03:13,780 --> 00:03:14,071
I was like,

123
00:03:14,071 --> 00:03:14,360
Hey,

124
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:16,410
I'll just take the whatever the,

125
00:03:16,411 --> 00:03:16,840
the,

126
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:17,170
the,

127
00:03:17,170 --> 00:03:20,050
you get fined or something like money.

128
00:03:20,051 --> 00:03:20,261
Right.

129
00:03:20,261 --> 00:03:21,780
It's not like you go
to prison immediately,

130
00:03:21,781 --> 00:03:22,060
right?

131
00:03:22,060 --> 00:03:22,350
No.

132
00:03:22,350 --> 00:03:23,530
I think you get to pay it,

133
00:03:23,531 --> 00:03:24,364
but you get fine.

134
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:25,170
Yeah.

135
00:03:25,170 --> 00:03:25,960
Just do that.

136
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:26,110
Yeah.

137
00:03:26,110 --> 00:03:26,290
The

138
00:03:26,290 --> 00:03:29,230
type of brain that you know
is like really organized.

139
00:03:29,260 --> 00:03:31,420
That's not the type of person
that does a silly podcast.

140
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:33,460
It's a totally different type of brain.

141
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:34,630
I'm convinced of that.

142
00:03:34,810 --> 00:03:35,021
You know,

143
00:03:35,021 --> 00:03:36,070
I fight with my,

144
00:03:36,071 --> 00:03:36,600
uh,

145
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:36,940
uh,

146
00:03:36,940 --> 00:03:40,260
illogical tendencies and
my procrastination in,

147
00:03:40,261 --> 00:03:40,441
in,

148
00:03:40,441 --> 00:03:40,651
in,

149
00:03:40,651 --> 00:03:40,950
in,

150
00:03:40,950 --> 00:03:42,580
in pulse liveness and craziness.

151
00:03:42,790 --> 00:03:44,500
But I think that's the only way comedians,

152
00:03:44,501 --> 00:03:45,161
brains work,

153
00:03:45,161 --> 00:03:45,994
I don't think.

154
00:03:46,020 --> 00:03:46,151
Yeah.

155
00:03:46,151 --> 00:03:48,610
I think it's just a constant
struggle to try to mend it.

156
00:03:48,620 --> 00:03:52,150
The society with that fucking
whacked down noodle on your head,

157
00:03:52,870 --> 00:03:53,770
Bryan red band.

158
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:54,431
Anyway,

159
00:03:54,431 --> 00:03:55,750
higher-primary.com.

160
00:03:56,020 --> 00:03:57,100
That's the tee shirt company.

161
00:03:57,370 --> 00:03:59,560
It's all like monkeys and
mushrooms and shit and,

162
00:03:59,610 --> 00:04:02,500
and there's a really cool Joey d
shirt and they're very soft shirts.

163
00:04:02,860 --> 00:04:03,450
High Quality.

164
00:04:03,450 --> 00:04:03,910
Sure.

165
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:05,860
Regular like fucking normal shirts.

166
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:07,770
It's like the highest quality we can get.

167
00:04:07,780 --> 00:04:10,000
We got really high
quality soft tee shirts,

168
00:04:10,001 --> 00:04:11,380
so it's like a fashion tee shirt,

169
00:04:11,650 --> 00:04:11,861
you know,

170
00:04:11,861 --> 00:04:12,670
that was the options.

171
00:04:12,670 --> 00:04:16,420
The options were spent a lot of money
on really expensive tee shirts or sell

172
00:04:16,421 --> 00:04:17,110
cheap ones.

173
00:04:17,110 --> 00:04:18,460
But I think they'd come out cool this way.

174
00:04:18,461 --> 00:04:18,730
It's,

175
00:04:18,730 --> 00:04:19,480
they're expensive,

176
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:20,313
they're not cheap,

177
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:22,000
but they're really well made.

178
00:04:22,210 --> 00:04:25,120
So that's what it is on [inaudible]
dot coms or other sponsor.

179
00:04:25,390 --> 00:04:25,721
Uh,

180
00:04:25,721 --> 00:04:28,430
if you go to o n n it and use a code name,

181
00:04:28,431 --> 00:04:28,751
Rogan,

182
00:04:28,751 --> 00:04:30,880
you will save 10% off
any of the supplements.

183
00:04:31,150 --> 00:04:34,600
The explanations for all these
supplements are all also at on it.

184
00:04:34,810 --> 00:04:36,970
I do a terrible job
explaining these things.

185
00:04:36,971 --> 00:04:40,840
Perhaps Dave Asprey could help us
because he's far smarter than I and these

186
00:04:40,841 --> 00:04:41,674
things.

187
00:04:41,710 --> 00:04:42,040
Um,

188
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:43,150
but I don't really know what's going on.

189
00:04:43,151 --> 00:04:43,931
I just don't want to use it.

190
00:04:43,931 --> 00:04:44,381
It's awesome.

191
00:04:44,381 --> 00:04:46,780
And there's a bunch of studies that
say the stuff inside of it is awesome.

192
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:49,930
A Alpha brain is my favorite
supplement period I had.

193
00:04:49,950 --> 00:04:52,030
So one thing that I make sure
I don't go anywhere without,

194
00:04:52,060 --> 00:04:53,860
if I'm doing a podcast
to bring it with me,

195
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:55,050
I'm doing a comedy show,

196
00:04:55,051 --> 00:04:55,660
I bring it with me.

197
00:04:55,660 --> 00:04:57,220
I take it before every UFC.

198
00:04:57,700 --> 00:04:57,911
Uh,

199
00:04:57,911 --> 00:05:00,580
it's not going to turn a genius
or a moron into a genius,

200
00:05:00,581 --> 00:05:03,910
but I really definitely feel
like it gives me a mental boost,

201
00:05:04,180 --> 00:05:05,230
if that makes any sense.

202
00:05:05,410 --> 00:05:10,120
And there's been shut studies have shown
that the ingredients in the doses that

203
00:05:10,121 --> 00:05:12,370
we use it have had positive
effects and studies.

204
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:13,331
So we're,

205
00:05:13,331 --> 00:05:14,830
we're doing our own studies right now.

206
00:05:14,831 --> 00:05:18,340
It takes 10 to 12 months for
a double blind placebo study,

207
00:05:18,730 --> 00:05:18,940
uh,

208
00:05:18,940 --> 00:05:20,350
from this university in Boston.

209
00:05:20,351 --> 00:05:21,460
And when they're done,

210
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:22,800
they take it and the,

211
00:05:22,801 --> 00:05:23,140
you know,

212
00:05:23,140 --> 00:05:26,200
process all the information and
figuring out whether or not it's legit.

213
00:05:26,201 --> 00:05:26,860
So we'll,

214
00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:28,240
we'll have actual studies,

215
00:05:28,241 --> 00:05:31,750
but the ingredients that are in
the study or the ingredients,

216
00:05:31,751 --> 00:05:32,740
whether they're in Alpha brain,

217
00:05:32,741 --> 00:05:33,880
in the doses that we use,

218
00:05:34,150 --> 00:05:35,770
have shown positive results.

219
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:36,650
It just,

220
00:05:36,650 --> 00:05:40,000
no one's ever proven that there's a
synergistic effect of all the ingredients

221
00:05:40,001 --> 00:05:40,270
together.

222
00:05:40,270 --> 00:05:41,920
That's the controversial aspect of it.

223
00:05:42,220 --> 00:05:43,080
Here's the deal though,

224
00:05:43,150 --> 00:05:44,560
the way we have it set up at on it,

225
00:05:44,620 --> 00:05:48,010
you get 100% money back
from the first 30 pills.

226
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:48,940
If you don't think it works,

227
00:05:48,970 --> 00:05:50,080
if it's not your thing,

228
00:05:50,380 --> 00:05:51,550
everybody's body's different.

229
00:05:51,820 --> 00:05:53,140
I don't know what you feel,

230
00:05:53,141 --> 00:05:54,550
and I know some people can't drink.

231
00:05:54,551 --> 00:05:56,350
I know some people can't smoke pot.

232
00:05:56,351 --> 00:05:57,184
Some people can't eat.

233
00:05:57,530 --> 00:05:58,580
The bodies are different.

234
00:05:58,910 --> 00:05:59,450
If it's not,

235
00:05:59,450 --> 00:06:00,210
if you don't feel it,

236
00:06:00,210 --> 00:06:01,310
I'm going to what your sensitivity is.

237
00:06:01,311 --> 00:06:02,150
If you don't think it's worth it,

238
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:03,470
you get a hundred percent money back.

239
00:06:03,471 --> 00:06:04,490
You don't have to return the product.

240
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:05,480
Nobody's trying to rip you off.

241
00:06:05,481 --> 00:06:08,540
We're trying to sell you
shit that I use everything.

242
00:06:08,541 --> 00:06:09,374
We sell it on it,

243
00:06:09,620 --> 00:06:14,000
whether it's vitamins or the BLENDTEC
blenders that are coming in tomorrow.

244
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:17,030
We start selling house
because Kale shakes pitches.

245
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:19,790
You got to get your morning
started off correct.

246
00:06:20,030 --> 00:06:22,250
I'm telling you the way to live life,

247
00:06:22,251 --> 00:06:22,431
it's,

248
00:06:22,431 --> 00:06:24,950
it's a healthier way to get out of bed.

249
00:06:25,130 --> 00:06:26,480
That's my newest phrase,

250
00:06:26,481 --> 00:06:26,811
by the way.

251
00:06:26,811 --> 00:06:28,520
I say that all to Kale,

252
00:06:28,521 --> 00:06:29,354
shake pitches.

253
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:33,170
Kale shakes his fucking guy
in the underground side.

254
00:06:33,171 --> 00:06:34,970
I went to the supermarket
and there was no Kale.

255
00:06:34,971 --> 00:06:35,391
Damn you,

256
00:06:35,391 --> 00:06:36,224
Joe Rogan.

257
00:06:37,460 --> 00:06:38,540
I noticed like restaurants.

258
00:06:38,541 --> 00:06:39,321
I'll have like Kale,

259
00:06:39,321 --> 00:06:40,041
everything like Kale,

260
00:06:40,041 --> 00:06:41,470
Caesar Salads now Kale.

261
00:06:41,530 --> 00:06:41,711
Yeah.

262
00:06:41,711 --> 00:06:42,531
When we were in Phoenix,

263
00:06:42,531 --> 00:06:43,700
I had a Kale Caesar Salad.

264
00:06:43,870 --> 00:06:44,030
Yeah.

265
00:06:44,030 --> 00:06:45,950
I think Kale is becoming more popular now.

266
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:46,911
It's just one of the people.

267
00:06:46,911 --> 00:06:47,661
It's a super food.

268
00:06:47,661 --> 00:06:49,190
I mean people are realizing how it's,

269
00:06:49,191 --> 00:06:49,671
it's really,

270
00:06:49,671 --> 00:06:51,570
it's got a lot of protein in [inaudible].

271
00:06:51,710 --> 00:06:52,221
Crazy.

272
00:06:52,221 --> 00:06:52,791
Good for you.

273
00:06:52,791 --> 00:06:56,660
It's really fucking good for you and
when you have it in this massive dose.

274
00:06:56,661 --> 00:06:57,291
The way I do it,

275
00:06:57,291 --> 00:06:58,070
I take the,

276
00:06:58,070 --> 00:06:58,300
the,

277
00:06:58,300 --> 00:07:01,280
the recipes available at
[inaudible] Dot com my recipe,

278
00:07:01,281 --> 00:07:02,450
my recipe is pretty extreme.

279
00:07:02,750 --> 00:07:04,250
It's got a lot of garlic in it.

280
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:06,020
It's got a lot of ginger in it,

281
00:07:06,050 --> 00:07:08,060
and it's got a fucking wall up plug.

282
00:07:08,061 --> 00:07:08,894
It hits you.

283
00:07:09,710 --> 00:07:10,110
It's,

284
00:07:10,110 --> 00:07:10,943
it's intense,

285
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:11,901
but Ooh,

286
00:07:11,901 --> 00:07:13,100
you feel good afterwards.

287
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:13,993
God Damn,

288
00:07:16,370 --> 00:07:17,450
everything just feels

289
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,390
it's alive.

290
00:07:21,110 --> 00:07:21,590
Um,

291
00:07:21,590 --> 00:07:21,951
anyway,

292
00:07:21,951 --> 00:07:23,360
we also sell kettle bells,

293
00:07:23,361 --> 00:07:24,021
battle ropes.

294
00:07:24,021 --> 00:07:24,321
Like I said,

295
00:07:24,321 --> 00:07:26,990
we have the BLENDTEC blenders
coming in and the supplements,

296
00:07:26,991 --> 00:07:27,980
there's new mood,

297
00:07:28,250 --> 00:07:33,250
which is a great five HTP and l tryptofan
supplement that it enhances your,

298
00:07:34,170 --> 00:07:39,170
your brain's production of Serotonin and
l Tryptofan converts into five HTP and

299
00:07:40,671 --> 00:07:42,770
five HTP converts into Serotonin,

300
00:07:42,771 --> 00:07:42,961
right?

301
00:07:42,961 --> 00:07:43,490
So I correct.

302
00:07:43,490 --> 00:07:44,120
Yep.

303
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:44,391
Yeah.

304
00:07:44,391 --> 00:07:45,590
And this is all done.

305
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:47,900
Here's all the scientific
studies behind all this stuff.

306
00:07:47,901 --> 00:07:51,500
And all the information available
is not just an audit.com,

307
00:07:51,501 --> 00:07:52,334
but at Google,

308
00:07:52,430 --> 00:07:53,820
if you Google nootropics,

309
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:56,390
you'll get a better idea of whether
or not you're interested in anything.

310
00:07:56,590 --> 00:07:57,140
Um,

311
00:07:57,140 --> 00:07:58,920
the most important thing to worry to,

312
00:07:58,980 --> 00:07:59,690
to,

313
00:07:59,690 --> 00:08:00,523
uh,

314
00:08:00,620 --> 00:08:01,350
to have on mine.

315
00:08:01,350 --> 00:08:01,520
Those,

316
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:02,420
you don't have to worry about it.

317
00:08:02,421 --> 00:08:03,770
So they're just new trans,

318
00:08:03,771 --> 00:08:04,670
it's not drugs.

319
00:08:04,910 --> 00:08:06,740
You're not going to test
positive for anything at work,

320
00:08:06,890 --> 00:08:08,360
including the hemp force protein.

321
00:08:08,361 --> 00:08:09,980
That's a big question that
comes up all the time.

322
00:08:10,250 --> 00:08:11,690
If you have the hemp force protein,

323
00:08:11,691 --> 00:08:12,380
no you will.

324
00:08:12,380 --> 00:08:17,030
There's no way you can taste positive
or rather test positive for marijuana.

325
00:08:17,031 --> 00:08:20,330
Hemp is completely non psychoactive.

326
00:08:20,331 --> 00:08:21,530
It's just a protein.

327
00:08:21,531 --> 00:08:22,640
It's just plants.

328
00:08:22,670 --> 00:08:23,410
It's just,

329
00:08:23,410 --> 00:08:23,930
it's not.

330
00:08:23,930 --> 00:08:26,480
It's like a cousin to
pot and it's illegal.

331
00:08:26,630 --> 00:08:27,463
Unfortunately.

332
00:08:27,470 --> 00:08:28,303
You can grow it,

333
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:30,230
you can buy it and you can sell it,

334
00:08:30,380 --> 00:08:31,213
but you can't grow it,

335
00:08:31,670 --> 00:08:33,650
which is a fucking crazy.

336
00:08:34,220 --> 00:08:35,540
It just shows you what a silly,

337
00:08:35,541 --> 00:08:35,991
silly,

338
00:08:35,991 --> 00:08:38,240
silly government we have
cause it's an awesome plan.

339
00:08:38,270 --> 00:08:41,330
It's got all the amino acids
in it you can make fuel out of.

340
00:08:41,330 --> 00:08:45,080
At Henry Ford made one of his
first cars out of it and the,

341
00:08:45,081 --> 00:08:48,110
the fiber of the hemp plant is so durable.

342
00:08:48,111 --> 00:08:49,670
It's really like an alien planet.

343
00:08:49,970 --> 00:08:51,830
The fact that we don't use it,

344
00:08:52,250 --> 00:08:53,270
just the hemp part,

345
00:08:53,271 --> 00:08:55,130
forget about the pot smoking pot.

346
00:08:55,140 --> 00:08:56,100
Forget about all that.

347
00:08:56,130 --> 00:08:59,850
Completely pretend that pot didn't exist.

348
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:01,020
It was never invented.

349
00:09:01,021 --> 00:09:01,854
No one ever had it.

350
00:09:02,340 --> 00:09:03,600
The hemp itself,

351
00:09:03,630 --> 00:09:08,630
making something like hemp illegal is
one of the dumbest things a human being

352
00:09:08,791 --> 00:09:09,440
can do.

353
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:12,090
It's almost like making apples illegal.

354
00:09:12,330 --> 00:09:16,080
It's worse than making apples illegal
because you can't make a house out of

355
00:09:16,081 --> 00:09:16,880
apples.

356
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:18,600
They make a fucking house at a hemp.

357
00:09:18,780 --> 00:09:23,070
You can construct cars out of
it that are stronger than steel.

358
00:09:23,250 --> 00:09:26,490
It's insane how strong the
fibers of this shit is.

359
00:09:26,670 --> 00:09:28,650
It makes a far superior paper.

360
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:30,870
It makes far superior clothing.

361
00:09:30,900 --> 00:09:32,100
Things that don't rip,

362
00:09:32,430 --> 00:09:37,430
but the reason why it's illegal is because
way back in the 1930s they invented a

363
00:09:38,131 --> 00:09:42,270
machine called the decorticator and that
decorticator takes hemp fiber and it

364
00:09:42,271 --> 00:09:45,480
breaks it down and it turns it
into something that's useful.

365
00:09:45,790 --> 00:09:50,250
It's a long and lengthy process that
they used to use slaves for though in

366
00:09:50,251 --> 00:09:51,780
slavery became illegal.

367
00:09:52,020 --> 00:09:56,040
It's much easier to get cotton and
use cotton than it is to use hemp,

368
00:09:56,310 --> 00:09:58,200
so that's why it's illegal.

369
00:09:58,320 --> 00:09:59,490
They all conspired,

370
00:09:59,491 --> 00:10:03,270
all these people that didn't want to lose
out to the hemp industry in the cotton

371
00:10:03,271 --> 00:10:04,050
industry,

372
00:10:04,050 --> 00:10:05,250
in the paper industry,

373
00:10:05,251 --> 00:10:07,080
especially William Randolph Hearst,

374
00:10:07,081 --> 00:10:11,340
he ran newspapers and he printed stories
about Mexican smoking marijuana and

375
00:10:11,341 --> 00:10:12,420
raping white women.

376
00:10:12,421 --> 00:10:17,421
It was all like just craziness to get
this one plant illegal and it was actually

377
00:10:17,730 --> 00:10:19,830
for its use as a commodity.

378
00:10:19,831 --> 00:10:23,700
That's what they were trying to
squash had nothing to do with it being

379
00:10:23,701 --> 00:10:24,600
psychoactive.

380
00:10:25,020 --> 00:10:26,460
It's amazing that that it,

381
00:10:26,461 --> 00:10:28,500
that hustle has lasted so long.

382
00:10:28,950 --> 00:10:29,281
Anyway,

383
00:10:29,281 --> 00:10:33,040
we have hemp protein that we buy from
Canada and it's the shit it's called hemp

384
00:10:33,041 --> 00:10:33,580
force.

385
00:10:33,580 --> 00:10:34,210
What are you doing?

386
00:10:34,210 --> 00:10:35,150
You're doing like,

387
00:10:36,850 --> 00:10:37,683
exactly.

388
00:10:37,790 --> 00:10:38,623
That's what I'm saying.

389
00:10:39,250 --> 00:10:40,690
I can't handle the truth either.

390
00:10:40,990 --> 00:10:43,720
I can't heal the truth cause even
when I say it when I say that,

391
00:10:43,721 --> 00:10:44,890
like that store that I just told,

392
00:10:44,891 --> 00:10:46,750
I know that to be a fact
of reddit everywhere.

393
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:48,190
It sounds so dumb.

394
00:10:48,430 --> 00:10:49,750
It sounds so ridiculous.

395
00:10:49,780 --> 00:10:50,740
It makes me angry.

396
00:10:50,860 --> 00:10:51,693
It's like people are,

397
00:10:51,910 --> 00:10:53,470
people are just beyond stupid.

398
00:10:53,740 --> 00:10:54,573
Brian.

399
00:10:55,090 --> 00:10:55,840
Yes.

400
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:56,673
Anyway,

401
00:10:56,740 --> 00:10:58,780
enough of me.

402
00:10:59,740 --> 00:11:01,360
Go to ana.com that's o.

403
00:11:01,361 --> 00:11:02,490
N.

404
00:11:02,490 --> 00:11:02,490
N.

405
00:11:02,490 --> 00:11:02,490
I.

406
00:11:02,490 --> 00:11:02,490
T.

407
00:11:02,490 --> 00:11:02,491
Oh,

408
00:11:02,491 --> 00:11:05,500
I almost forgot the tangle that
got a lot of fucking commercials,

409
00:11:05,501 --> 00:11:05,800
man.

410
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:06,710
If I was on an internet,

411
00:11:06,910 --> 00:11:08,860
I would be complaining about me right now.

412
00:11:09,250 --> 00:11:10,001
A lot of commercials.

413
00:11:10,001 --> 00:11:12,030
You just always go really
long on the Onnit one.

414
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:12,520
Well,

415
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:13,150
you know,

416
00:11:13,150 --> 00:11:14,020
here's the thing.

417
00:11:14,110 --> 00:11:17,350
I go along on anything that I absolutely
believe in it because you're on it.

418
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:20,490
I am on it and it also is because I would,

419
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:21,220
I do in the middle.

420
00:11:21,220 --> 00:11:22,510
I don't know how everybody
else is doing them,

421
00:11:22,511 --> 00:11:25,150
but I think a lot of people are
sticking them in the conversations now.

422
00:11:25,630 --> 00:11:27,070
I know that that's what Adam Carolla does.

423
00:11:27,071 --> 00:11:31,300
He does like podcasts and then he does
commercial is like a radio show that I

424
00:11:31,301 --> 00:11:32,650
think that fucks with me.

425
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:35,950
Maybe that's why the flashlight was
pretty fun because I can always bring the

426
00:11:35,951 --> 00:11:36,640
flat side.

427
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:37,600
It's like the olive garden.

428
00:11:38,770 --> 00:11:39,520
Yes.

429
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:40,780
You always could.

430
00:11:41,090 --> 00:11:44,020
I don't think we should keep it
as a sponsor just for that reason.

431
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:49,030
Ting is an excellent product though
and everything we sell on his podcast,

432
00:11:49,031 --> 00:11:49,930
I guess we're selling things.

433
00:11:50,230 --> 00:11:51,070
Everything we promote,

434
00:11:51,071 --> 00:11:51,441
there we go.

435
00:11:51,441 --> 00:11:53,150
Everything we're paid to promote is,

436
00:11:53,350 --> 00:11:55,360
is things that we believe in 100%.

437
00:11:55,780 --> 00:11:56,350
Um,

438
00:11:56,350 --> 00:11:59,350
you don't ever have to worry
about us trying to rip you off.

439
00:11:59,380 --> 00:12:03,220
If there's anything that's being
talked about on this podcast,

440
00:12:03,221 --> 00:12:07,060
it's always going to be 100%
to the best of my knowledge.

441
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:08,320
And if I'm ever incorrect,

442
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:12,700
I will definitely know that I fucked
up and everything that we're selling,

443
00:12:12,701 --> 00:12:17,350
whether it's through on it or
through audible.com or even ting is,

444
00:12:18,070 --> 00:12:21,940
what are you doing with the team
that's not the same pin pong?

445
00:12:22,330 --> 00:12:23,163
What is Ting?

446
00:12:23,170 --> 00:12:26,510
Ting is a cell phone service that you,

447
00:12:26,550 --> 00:12:28,000
you sign up for and they use sprints,

448
00:12:28,001 --> 00:12:31,030
backbone and they sell cool phones.

449
00:12:31,260 --> 00:12:32,260
Like android phones.

450
00:12:32,261 --> 00:12:34,540
Like the galaxy s three
is big fucking cool.

451
00:12:34,541 --> 00:12:36,910
Last one that you see in the
commercials every day lately.

452
00:12:37,300 --> 00:12:38,320
And um,

453
00:12:38,350 --> 00:12:42,090
they have it set up so that
you can quit it anytime you,

454
00:12:42,110 --> 00:12:43,630
you don't have to have contracts.

455
00:12:43,780 --> 00:12:46,810
Your minutes can pile on to
like more than one phone.

456
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:48,610
Like you can share minutes with like,

457
00:12:48,611 --> 00:12:48,821
you know,

458
00:12:48,821 --> 00:12:49,654
your wife.

459
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:50,350
Um,

460
00:12:50,350 --> 00:12:51,250
and you also,

461
00:12:51,251 --> 00:12:54,670
if you don't use a certain
amount of minutes every month,

462
00:12:54,671 --> 00:12:56,950
if you're allotted a certain amount
of minutes and you don't use them,

463
00:12:57,100 --> 00:13:02,100
you're dropped dropdown and credited
to the lower level of a payment plan.

464
00:13:02,980 --> 00:13:04,990
So they actually give you money back.

465
00:13:04,991 --> 00:13:06,100
I mean it's a really,

466
00:13:06,970 --> 00:13:07,661
it's a really,

467
00:13:07,661 --> 00:13:08,110
it's like,

468
00:13:08,110 --> 00:13:09,730
it's a really fair company.

469
00:13:09,970 --> 00:13:11,530
It's like I love the,

470
00:13:11,531 --> 00:13:11,801
the,

471
00:13:11,801 --> 00:13:15,600
the ethical way in which they're
choosing to do business there.

472
00:13:15,601 --> 00:13:16,091
They're saying,

473
00:13:16,091 --> 00:13:17,290
we make plenty of money.

474
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:19,060
Let's just do this really fair.

475
00:13:19,090 --> 00:13:21,400
Let's sell people a quality product.

476
00:13:21,401 --> 00:13:22,450
Like all these killer,

477
00:13:23,250 --> 00:13:23,410
uh,

478
00:13:23,410 --> 00:13:24,221
android phones,

479
00:13:24,221 --> 00:13:25,180
they have regular phones too.

480
00:13:25,181 --> 00:13:26,170
If you're into flip phones.

481
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:31,330
But what they decided to do is
use this big company's network,

482
00:13:31,331 --> 00:13:32,470
use sprints,

483
00:13:32,471 --> 00:13:33,280
backbone,

484
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:33,971
which is a huge,

485
00:13:33,971 --> 00:13:35,260
then we can't come up with your own,

486
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:35,890
but then,

487
00:13:35,890 --> 00:13:36,430
you know,

488
00:13:36,430 --> 00:13:38,770
use it in a way that they feel is fair.

489
00:13:39,310 --> 00:13:44,170
And so they provide an excellent service
and they give you cool phones and you

490
00:13:44,171 --> 00:13:45,004
can quit at any time.

491
00:13:45,010 --> 00:13:45,400
I mean,

492
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:46,270
there's no contracts.

493
00:13:46,300 --> 00:13:46,511
It's,

494
00:13:46,511 --> 00:13:47,141
it's a really,

495
00:13:47,141 --> 00:13:49,630
it's a beautiful situation and that's
really what I think it should be with

496
00:13:49,631 --> 00:13:50,620
every cell phone company.

497
00:13:50,770 --> 00:13:54,880
It's crazy that you get locked into
these contracts and they rope you in by

498
00:13:54,881 --> 00:13:58,930
giving you some crazy discount on
his phone and it suits all bananas.

499
00:13:59,110 --> 00:14:01,410
But the bottom line is if you
want to leave cause your service,

500
00:14:01,450 --> 00:14:02,380
your service sucks.

501
00:14:02,590 --> 00:14:03,423
It costs a lot of money.

502
00:14:03,700 --> 00:14:03,851
Well,

503
00:14:03,851 --> 00:14:04,870
not with Tang Tang,

504
00:14:04,871 --> 00:14:05,201
you just,

505
00:14:05,201 --> 00:14:06,034
you just bail.

506
00:14:06,430 --> 00:14:07,000
That's it.

507
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:12,000
Go to rogan.ting.com and you'll save 50
bucks off your first digital cellular

508
00:14:13,361 --> 00:14:18,210
device for talking to people through
the air and you took it beyond Ting.

509
00:14:18,890 --> 00:14:19,571
All right pitches,

510
00:14:19,571 --> 00:14:20,680
Dave Asprey's here.

511
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:22,180
We're going to get to
the bottom of things.

512
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:23,770
We're going to get an educated,

513
00:14:24,250 --> 00:14:26,020
we're going to get experienced who?

514
00:14:26,021 --> 00:14:26,854
That's my new,

515
00:14:26,890 --> 00:14:28,570
that's my new tagline
of being in a very show.

516
00:14:28,750 --> 00:14:29,800
It's just cheesy as it gets.

517
00:14:30,430 --> 00:14:35,370
We're going to get some experience
trying by day Joe Rogan podcast by night.

518
00:14:38,230 --> 00:14:38,531
Dude,

519
00:14:38,531 --> 00:14:39,460
we're getting experienced.

520
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:45,310
We just got out of it from being on it
and now we're getting it back in it.

521
00:14:45,390 --> 00:14:46,270
We're experienced.

522
00:14:46,271 --> 00:14:46,720
Dude.

523
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:47,890
That's how I'm feeling that right now.

524
00:14:47,891 --> 00:14:48,280
Dave,

525
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:49,091
thanks for coming man.

526
00:14:49,091 --> 00:14:49,930
Really appreciate it.

527
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:52,070
Tait Fletcher is your number one

528
00:14:52,070 --> 00:14:52,401
fan.

529
00:14:52,401 --> 00:14:52,710
Boy.

530
00:14:52,710 --> 00:14:56,360
So please give a big shout out
at the beginning of this podcast.

531
00:14:56,770 --> 00:14:57,140
Tate,

532
00:14:57,140 --> 00:14:57,973
you rock man.

533
00:14:58,330 --> 00:14:59,780
Date as bulletproof,

534
00:14:59,781 --> 00:15:00,231
everything.

535
00:15:00,231 --> 00:15:02,390
Every fucking tweety
sends stay bulletproof.

536
00:15:02,420 --> 00:15:03,253
My friends,

537
00:15:03,380 --> 00:15:05,630
it's like he's like the most
interesting man in the world,

538
00:15:05,631 --> 00:15:06,740
but it's about bulletproof.

539
00:15:06,741 --> 00:15:06,891
You know,

540
00:15:06,891 --> 00:15:07,970
instead of stay thirsty,

541
00:15:08,030 --> 00:15:08,930
he totally rocks.

542
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:10,400
He loves you man.

543
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:13,310
He's got a fucking serious
man crush on your ideas.

544
00:15:13,910 --> 00:15:15,710
Homeboy came in with a jug.

545
00:15:15,770 --> 00:15:16,603
I love pate.

546
00:15:16,610 --> 00:15:18,680
Me and Tate both have
the coffee addiction.

547
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:19,940
I love him for a bunch of reasons,

548
00:15:19,941 --> 00:15:20,774
but that's one of them.

549
00:15:20,930 --> 00:15:24,950
We both have the coffee addiction and
take comes in with this fucking ridiculous

550
00:15:24,951 --> 00:15:29,951
like camping for a month mug filled with
bulletproof coffee and he poured bees

551
00:15:30,511 --> 00:15:30,740
up.

552
00:15:30,740 --> 00:15:32,120
It was pretty bad ass man.

553
00:15:32,130 --> 00:15:32,721
That was the first,

554
00:15:32,721 --> 00:15:32,900
uh,

555
00:15:32,900 --> 00:15:35,240
my first experience
with bulletproof coffee.

556
00:15:35,241 --> 00:15:36,440
And this is your creation.

557
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:37,040
Yup.

558
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:39,260
And for folks who don't understand
what bulletproof coffee is,

559
00:15:39,261 --> 00:15:40,094
what it consists of,

560
00:15:40,250 --> 00:15:40,761
what's a,

561
00:15:40,761 --> 00:15:41,750
what's in exactly.

562
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:43,490
It's low toxin coffee,

563
00:15:43,491 --> 00:15:46,190
which has a different mental
effect to than the normal stuff.

564
00:15:46,220 --> 00:15:46,581
This will,

565
00:15:46,581 --> 00:15:48,050
you can just buy on any street corner.

566
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:51,830
You blend it with grass fed butter
that has certain fatty acids,

567
00:15:51,860 --> 00:15:52,910
short chain fatty acids.

568
00:15:52,911 --> 00:15:56,660
Your brain needs for anti-inflammatory
purposes and you blend it with either

569
00:15:56,661 --> 00:15:58,970
coconut oil or MCT oil,

570
00:15:59,030 --> 00:16:03,140
which is an extract of coconut oil that
six times stronger and you blend it.

571
00:16:03,170 --> 00:16:04,180
It gets foamy and froth.

572
00:16:04,181 --> 00:16:05,810
He just liked the best latte you ever had.

573
00:16:05,811 --> 00:16:06,710
It doesn't taste gross.

574
00:16:06,711 --> 00:16:07,540
It doesn't taste buttery,

575
00:16:07,540 --> 00:16:08,373
oily,

576
00:16:08,540 --> 00:16:12,560
and when you drink it you are full for
eight hours and you have this incredible

577
00:16:12,561 --> 00:16:13,071
focus.

578
00:16:13,071 --> 00:16:13,960
This mental focus,

579
00:16:13,961 --> 00:16:14,360
it's,

580
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:15,290
it's just insane.

581
00:16:15,650 --> 00:16:16,483
Whoa.

582
00:16:16,700 --> 00:16:17,600
How's that possible?

583
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:18,921
What is it doing?

584
00:16:18,921 --> 00:16:19,500
It's just,

585
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:19,800
it's,

586
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:20,840
it's causing,

587
00:16:20,841 --> 00:16:24,470
it's like a synergistic effect with
the butter and the oil and the coffee.

588
00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:27,200
It makes the stimulant last longer.

589
00:16:27,201 --> 00:16:27,950
Is that what it is?

590
00:16:27,950 --> 00:16:28,191
Well,

591
00:16:28,191 --> 00:16:31,730
the hunger part happens because your body
is getting the short and medium chain

592
00:16:31,731 --> 00:16:33,950
fatty acids that are really
hard to get in your diet,

593
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:35,900
so because you're doing that,

594
00:16:35,930 --> 00:16:40,490
you're already getting a big boost there
and then we believe that it probably

595
00:16:40,491 --> 00:16:43,610
helps to escort the terpenes
that are inside coffee,

596
00:16:43,611 --> 00:16:44,080
like caffeine,

597
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:44,831
strong cow hall,

598
00:16:44,831 --> 00:16:47,090
that the psychoactive compounds
that are not caffeine.

599
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:48,920
We think it helps those go into the brain.

600
00:16:49,370 --> 00:16:53,330
And the other reason that I'm theorizing
that it gives you this kind of boost is

601
00:16:53,331 --> 00:16:56,960
because of the small drops of fat that
are formed when you blend it or called

602
00:16:56,961 --> 00:17:01,070
Micelles and they absorbed better into
the body and your body can burn MCT for

603
00:17:01,071 --> 00:17:03,620
energy without any digestive
process required at all.

604
00:17:03,740 --> 00:17:06,380
This is the thing that like bodybuilders
used to get lean and ripped when

605
00:17:06,381 --> 00:17:07,700
they're in the shedding phase.

606
00:17:08,060 --> 00:17:11,360
It also happens to cure Alzheimer's
disease and it makes you feel really good.

607
00:17:11,930 --> 00:17:13,160
I put it in my Kale shakes.

608
00:17:13,161 --> 00:17:17,810
I put four big teaspoons tablespoons
of coconut oil and it tastes good.

609
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:18,130
Yeah,

610
00:17:18,130 --> 00:17:19,220
so we've got a good taste to it.

611
00:17:19,250 --> 00:17:21,960
Everyone should be eating coconut oil
unless they're allergic to coconut.

612
00:17:21,980 --> 00:17:22,880
It's that straight forward.

613
00:17:22,881 --> 00:17:25,550
Do you remember when they were saying
the coconut oil is bad for you?

614
00:17:25,580 --> 00:17:26,413
When we were kids,

615
00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:28,640
just like the American soil
association got one in there.

616
00:17:28,670 --> 00:17:29,360
Is that what it was?

617
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:29,481
Yeah,

618
00:17:29,481 --> 00:17:34,310
they did a like a six week
study of hydrogenated coconut
oil versus their crappy

619
00:17:34,311 --> 00:17:35,970
oil and then what do you know?

620
00:17:35,971 --> 00:17:39,260
It raise cholesterol and til this day
you ask the average like 40 50 year old

621
00:17:39,290 --> 00:17:40,123
American.

622
00:17:40,130 --> 00:17:40,821
You say coconut oil,

623
00:17:40,821 --> 00:17:41,840
they say cholesterol and you're like,

624
00:17:41,870 --> 00:17:42,690
there's not in there.

625
00:17:42,690 --> 00:17:42,980
I'm like,

626
00:17:42,980 --> 00:17:44,150
it's cholesterol free.

627
00:17:44,151 --> 00:17:45,480
Not that it's a problem.

628
00:17:45,490 --> 00:17:47,330
It has cholesterol but salt.

629
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:48,111
That's another one.

630
00:17:48,111 --> 00:17:49,040
People are so silly.

631
00:17:49,140 --> 00:17:49,471
Salt.

632
00:17:49,471 --> 00:17:51,120
Salt gives you a high blood pressure.

633
00:17:51,121 --> 00:17:51,690
Salt.

634
00:17:51,690 --> 00:17:52,010
No.

635
00:17:52,010 --> 00:17:54,120
Salt is a fucking mineral.

636
00:17:54,121 --> 00:17:54,954
You dummies.

637
00:17:55,080 --> 00:17:58,110
It's as an essential mineral and
you can have too little of it.

638
00:17:58,350 --> 00:18:00,000
Saul is not making you fat.

639
00:18:00,900 --> 00:18:05,640
That is so crazy that that thought that
salt is making you fat has always driven

640
00:18:05,641 --> 00:18:07,140
me fucking bananas.

641
00:18:07,141 --> 00:18:09,330
It's going to give you high blood
pressure with all that salt.

642
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:10,171
Do you know that?

643
00:18:10,171 --> 00:18:13,620
That that it raises your blood pressure
within the error margin of a blood

644
00:18:13,621 --> 00:18:14,250
pressure cuff.

645
00:18:14,250 --> 00:18:15,083
That's it.

646
00:18:15,430 --> 00:18:16,920
But it's meaningless.

647
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:18,900
And why does everybody connect salt,

648
00:18:18,901 --> 00:18:23,240
the high blood pressure it has to
do with the marketing of an anti uh,

649
00:18:23,250 --> 00:18:24,083
blood pressure drugs.

650
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:28,170
So they found out back in
about 1960 that that was how,

651
00:18:28,190 --> 00:18:28,451
uh,

652
00:18:28,451 --> 00:18:28,651
that,

653
00:18:28,651 --> 00:18:29,850
that was a way to lower blood pressure.

654
00:18:29,850 --> 00:18:29,971
Well,

655
00:18:29,971 --> 00:18:31,950
if you get people to
basically pay more water out,

656
00:18:31,951 --> 00:18:34,290
their blood gets thicker so then
their blood pressure goes down.

657
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:38,280
So they started looking at salts effect
on that and they went down this path and

658
00:18:38,281 --> 00:18:39,750
get this in 1997,

659
00:18:39,751 --> 00:18:41,040
the Lancet medical journal,

660
00:18:41,041 --> 00:18:42,480
which is kind of a bad ass one,

661
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:46,800
they published a whole thing about
how the salt myth didn't work,

662
00:18:46,801 --> 00:18:48,090
how there was scientific fraud,

663
00:18:48,091 --> 00:18:50,910
how people probably should have gone
to jail for spending taxpayer money and

664
00:18:50,911 --> 00:18:51,750
making up data.

665
00:18:52,230 --> 00:18:53,190
And yet to this day,

666
00:18:53,191 --> 00:18:55,860
you still hear government campaigns
to lower salt consumption,

667
00:18:55,890 --> 00:18:58,560
knowing full well that it makes your
adrenals break when you don't get enough

668
00:18:58,561 --> 00:18:59,010
salt.

669
00:18:59,010 --> 00:18:59,910
I do 10 grams a day.

670
00:18:59,911 --> 00:19:00,840
I have for 10 years.

671
00:19:00,841 --> 00:19:02,340
I carry a vial of it around with me.

672
00:19:02,580 --> 00:19:05,580
I wouldn't think of starting in the
morning without a teaspoon of salt.

673
00:19:05,610 --> 00:19:06,240
Whoa.

674
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:07,970
Every morning in your shakes.

675
00:19:08,540 --> 00:19:09,360
Yeah,

676
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:10,193
there's a reason for it.

677
00:19:10,230 --> 00:19:10,680
Okay.

678
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:11,341
What kind of salt?

679
00:19:11,341 --> 00:19:12,030
What's the best?

680
00:19:12,030 --> 00:19:13,500
I like the Himalayan crystal salt.

681
00:19:13,620 --> 00:19:15,390
It's still just cause it
comes from the Himalayas

682
00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:18,540
as his dope,

683
00:19:19,260 --> 00:19:21,830
bringing back some fucking
Himalayan salt son,

684
00:19:22,610 --> 00:19:23,030
you know,

685
00:19:23,030 --> 00:19:23,910
and there's other kinds of,

686
00:19:23,911 --> 00:19:25,080
any kind of sea salt is going to do it,

687
00:19:25,081 --> 00:19:26,730
but there's less pollution
in the Himalayan stuff.

688
00:19:26,731 --> 00:19:29,690
And I like the idea that it's aren't
that it's mind to buy one arm to monks.

689
00:19:29,730 --> 00:19:30,040
It's just,

690
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:30,680
is it really,

691
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:31,513
you know,

692
00:19:31,620 --> 00:19:32,221
grass fed.

693
00:19:32,221 --> 00:19:34,170
So imagine the only way to get a job,

694
00:19:34,171 --> 00:19:34,351
there's,

695
00:19:34,351 --> 00:19:34,561
you know,

696
00:19:34,561 --> 00:19:36,990
chop off one of your
arms dues would do it.

697
00:19:37,020 --> 00:19:38,490
There's enough people out
there that would do it.

698
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:40,740
Probably were fucking crazy,

699
00:19:40,741 --> 00:19:41,574
man.

700
00:19:41,850 --> 00:19:42,930
I guarantee you they would do it.

701
00:19:43,050 --> 00:19:46,290
So what is the benefit of putting
the salt in your body every morning?

702
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:47,880
Here's what happens when
you wake up in the morning,

703
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:48,953
when you first wake up,

704
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:49,681
your body says,

705
00:19:49,681 --> 00:19:51,240
and this is like your reptilian brain,

706
00:19:51,540 --> 00:19:53,190
the low level parts of
your operating system,

707
00:19:53,191 --> 00:19:54,050
you don't pay any attention to,

708
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:54,300
oh,

709
00:19:54,300 --> 00:19:55,133
I mean the whole thing.

710
00:19:55,860 --> 00:19:56,693
Exactly.

711
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:59,160
So you wake up and it says,

712
00:19:59,220 --> 00:19:59,860
hmm,

713
00:19:59,860 --> 00:20:00,160
this,

714
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:01,950
this body is going to
stand up in a minute.

715
00:20:01,951 --> 00:20:02,790
And when it stands up,

716
00:20:02,791 --> 00:20:05,610
I've got to have enough blood pressure
in the brain if I don't have enough blood

717
00:20:05,611 --> 00:20:07,830
pressure in the brain and he's going to
pass out in a tiger going to eat him.

718
00:20:07,831 --> 00:20:11,160
So this is like a survival level
imperative inside your body.

719
00:20:11,820 --> 00:20:13,290
So what does it do?

720
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:14,730
It goes to your adrenal glands and says,

721
00:20:14,731 --> 00:20:15,270
hey buddy,

722
00:20:15,270 --> 00:20:18,630
could you crank up some cortisol and
could you change the sodium to potassium

723
00:20:18,631 --> 00:20:18,960
ratio?

724
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:20,130
I need you to find sodium,

725
00:20:20,131 --> 00:20:21,240
which is hard for people to do.

726
00:20:21,241 --> 00:20:23,790
That's why we used to pay our
soldiers in salt instead of in gold.

727
00:20:24,390 --> 00:20:28,020
And then it says crank down and
potassium crank up on sodium.

728
00:20:28,430 --> 00:20:30,930
If in the morning you take
your sodium and you drink it,

729
00:20:30,931 --> 00:20:32,010
soon after you wake up,

730
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:33,810
your adrenal glands don't
have to do all that work.

731
00:20:33,930 --> 00:20:36,690
So then you have that adrenal function
for the rest of the day to feel good.

732
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:42,793
All

733
00:20:43,650 --> 00:20:44,370
right,

734
00:20:44,370 --> 00:20:45,203
I'll do it.

735
00:20:46,770 --> 00:20:47,603
Or you pulled it out.

736
00:20:47,630 --> 00:20:48,463
Yeah.

737
00:20:49,150 --> 00:20:50,150
Can you put it back up

738
00:20:54,450 --> 00:20:54,721
Tony?

739
00:20:54,721 --> 00:20:54,871
How,

740
00:20:54,871 --> 00:20:55,200
what,

741
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:56,490
what's happening here folks,

742
00:20:57,210 --> 00:20:58,230
your uh,

743
00:20:58,530 --> 00:21:01,110
your adrenal glands are more relaxed.

744
00:21:01,111 --> 00:21:02,100
I actually recommend this,

745
00:21:02,101 --> 00:21:04,710
especially for women when they're
pregnant because they have enough stress

746
00:21:04,711 --> 00:21:05,041
already.

747
00:21:05,041 --> 00:21:09,030
I have a book coming out in January
about like how to have better genes and

748
00:21:09,031 --> 00:21:11,610
bigger brains in your kid's starting
even before you get pregnant.

749
00:21:12,030 --> 00:21:13,030
The knowingness,

750
00:21:13,050 --> 00:21:14,340
having this knowledge in your head,

751
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:17,820
does it infuriate you when
you see these lower salt,

752
00:21:17,821 --> 00:21:18,391
you know,

753
00:21:18,391 --> 00:21:20,910
campaigns and you hear
people talking about it,

754
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:21,361
like,

755
00:21:21,361 --> 00:21:21,631
you know,

756
00:21:21,631 --> 00:21:23,520
lower a low salt foods.

757
00:21:23,820 --> 00:21:24,151
Like what?

758
00:21:24,151 --> 00:21:24,984
What is that?

759
00:21:25,050 --> 00:21:26,250
It used to infuriate me,

760
00:21:26,251 --> 00:21:27,090
but to be honest,

761
00:21:27,091 --> 00:21:29,130
I've done enough of the
meditation and the brain hacking.

762
00:21:29,131 --> 00:21:30,800
Like I don't get mad at
stuff like that cause it,

763
00:21:30,870 --> 00:21:32,190
it's not worth the cost of getting mad.

764
00:21:32,191 --> 00:21:33,720
But what I do is I do something about it.

765
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:36,090
Like that's why I started
the bulletproof exact blog.

766
00:21:36,120 --> 00:21:37,830
It's that there's a lot of this knowledge.

767
00:21:37,831 --> 00:21:38,910
I used to weigh 300 pounds.

768
00:21:38,911 --> 00:21:43,080
I was profoundly unhealthy for the first
half of my life and no one taught me

769
00:21:43,081 --> 00:21:44,970
any of the things that my body can do.

770
00:21:44,971 --> 00:21:47,400
It's just the knowledge wasn't
out there and now it is,

771
00:21:47,401 --> 00:21:49,260
but there's a credibility
problems and I'm like,

772
00:21:49,261 --> 00:21:49,620
look,

773
00:21:49,620 --> 00:21:52,710
I'm a pretty successful guy and I wouldn't
have been this successful if I hadn't

774
00:21:52,711 --> 00:21:53,311
learned all this stuff.

775
00:21:53,311 --> 00:21:54,480
So here it is and it's free.

776
00:21:54,510 --> 00:21:55,470
I just give it to people.

777
00:21:55,620 --> 00:21:57,570
I've got seven people working
for me now doing this.

778
00:21:57,720 --> 00:21:58,553
Wow.

779
00:21:58,590 --> 00:22:02,070
So you were 300 pounds and how old
were you when this was going on?

780
00:22:02,071 --> 00:22:02,281
See,

781
00:22:02,281 --> 00:22:04,110
I hit a 23 years old.

782
00:22:04,140 --> 00:22:05,970
I hit 300 pounds to 97 hours.

783
00:22:06,090 --> 00:22:06,750
Yeah.

784
00:22:06,750 --> 00:22:07,620
Holy Shit.

785
00:22:07,621 --> 00:22:08,454
That's big.

786
00:22:08,550 --> 00:22:09,383
What was that like?

787
00:22:09,690 --> 00:22:09,931
I mean,

788
00:22:09,931 --> 00:22:10,501
it sucked.

789
00:22:10,501 --> 00:22:12,530
I was fat as a teenager to horrible diet.

790
00:22:12,870 --> 00:22:13,260
Well,

791
00:22:13,260 --> 00:22:14,730
I thought I was eating the right stuff.

792
00:22:14,731 --> 00:22:14,971
You know,

793
00:22:14,971 --> 00:22:15,070
I,

794
00:22:15,070 --> 00:22:18,810
in fact during that time I worked out
six days a week for an hour and a half a

795
00:22:18,811 --> 00:22:21,090
day and I ate 1800 calories.

796
00:22:21,091 --> 00:22:21,630
You know what?

797
00:22:21,630 --> 00:22:22,710
If your hormones are Jack,

798
00:22:22,711 --> 00:22:23,550
you're not going to lose weight.

799
00:22:23,551 --> 00:22:25,620
I did eat less than my thin friends.

800
00:22:25,770 --> 00:22:26,610
I just couldn't lose the weight.

801
00:22:26,611 --> 00:22:27,840
I was tired all the time too.

802
00:22:28,290 --> 00:22:29,460
And you have thyroid,

803
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:30,241
anything with your thought?

804
00:22:30,241 --> 00:22:31,770
I did have some thyroid issues,

805
00:22:31,980 --> 00:22:33,090
but it wasn't just thyroid.

806
00:22:33,091 --> 00:22:36,570
Like there's all kinds of toxin and even
like swelling that happens in the body.

807
00:22:36,571 --> 00:22:38,250
If you have chronic
inflammation turned on,

808
00:22:38,430 --> 00:22:40,530
you're going to be storing
a third of your fat.

809
00:22:40,531 --> 00:22:41,460
Maybe it's not even fat,

810
00:22:41,461 --> 00:22:43,080
it's just like tissue inflammation.

811
00:22:43,470 --> 00:22:44,011
So for me,

812
00:22:44,011 --> 00:22:47,550
I had to figure out what was causing my
inflammation and what's your cortisol

813
00:22:47,551 --> 00:22:47,770
level?

814
00:22:47,770 --> 00:22:51,000
So there's all these delicate hormones
that you manipulate through your food and

815
00:22:51,001 --> 00:22:53,790
through your environment and
the idea that calories in,

816
00:22:53,791 --> 00:22:55,230
calories out matters.

817
00:22:55,350 --> 00:22:55,951
I tell you,

818
00:22:55,951 --> 00:22:56,940
I ran this experiment.

819
00:22:57,390 --> 00:22:58,410
It was a little crazy.

820
00:22:58,680 --> 00:23:02,550
I know that the calorie
thing is completely broken
because we're not robots.

821
00:23:02,551 --> 00:23:02,670
You know,

822
00:23:02,670 --> 00:23:03,331
we're not like a car.

823
00:23:03,331 --> 00:23:04,830
You put gas in and you get so many miles.

824
00:23:04,831 --> 00:23:06,420
As long as the wind
resistance is the same.

825
00:23:07,050 --> 00:23:09,390
So I thought I would eat
4,000 calories a day.

826
00:23:09,391 --> 00:23:13,740
I'd sleep five hours a night or less and
I'd stop exercising and I thought maybe

827
00:23:13,741 --> 00:23:14,200
I'll gain,

828
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:14,520
you know,

829
00:23:14,520 --> 00:23:16,080
a couple pounds in a
month or two and I'll say,

830
00:23:16,081 --> 00:23:16,291
look,

831
00:23:16,291 --> 00:23:17,310
I should have gained 10 pounds.

832
00:23:17,311 --> 00:23:18,144
I gained two pounds.

833
00:23:18,150 --> 00:23:19,230
I went for two years.

834
00:23:19,860 --> 00:23:23,190
I posted a picture of a six
pack that grew during that time.

835
00:23:23,220 --> 00:23:26,220
I should have weighed 616 pounds
after two years of this program.

836
00:23:26,340 --> 00:23:30,300
I'm not counting the sleep deficit
and I weighed two 10 at the end of it.

837
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:32,490
And actually it was more
muscular than I was before.

838
00:23:33,420 --> 00:23:33,751
Of course,

839
00:23:33,751 --> 00:23:34,890
I was drinking bulletproof coffee,

840
00:23:34,891 --> 00:23:36,330
I was doing bulletproof
intermittent fasting,

841
00:23:36,331 --> 00:23:37,620
which I developed during that time,

842
00:23:37,860 --> 00:23:38,880
which is intermittent fasting.

843
00:23:38,881 --> 00:23:40,470
But you have only fat in the morning,

844
00:23:40,650 --> 00:23:41,930
which gives you this huge boost,

845
00:23:41,931 --> 00:23:44,040
the one that Tate was talking
about when he was here with you.

846
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:47,270
So can do all these crazy
things with the body.

847
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:47,731
But I'll,

848
00:23:47,731 --> 00:23:51,200
I'll tell you a fight out like fat doesn't
make you fat and calories don't make

849
00:23:51,201 --> 00:23:53,780
your fat calories fuel your
brain though they're useful,

850
00:23:53,990 --> 00:23:56,060
but they're not a very good way
of measuring your intake of food.

851
00:23:56,420 --> 00:23:57,260
So what is it?

852
00:23:57,280 --> 00:23:57,550
What?

853
00:23:57,550 --> 00:23:58,640
How does someone get fat?

854
00:23:58,641 --> 00:24:01,610
Then it turns out things
like Leptin resistance,

855
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:05,900
things like inflammation in the gut
and things like insulin all play a role

856
00:24:05,901 --> 00:24:06,500
there.

857
00:24:06,500 --> 00:24:11,150
What happens is your mitochondria
and your cells also can get weak.

858
00:24:11,210 --> 00:24:14,270
You actually get used to having eat
every two hours is this idea of frequent

859
00:24:14,271 --> 00:24:15,710
snacking to keep your energy up.

860
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:19,910
What you're doing is you're teaching
the body to actually like need to not be

861
00:24:19,911 --> 00:24:20,744
able to store,

862
00:24:20,870 --> 00:24:21,810
to not be resilient.

863
00:24:21,811 --> 00:24:24,440
It's not be able to store
any kind of calories at all.

864
00:24:24,890 --> 00:24:29,890
What I do is I teach my body to burn fat
and I keep my calories at at least 50%

865
00:24:30,141 --> 00:24:31,370
of my calories are coming from fat.

866
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:34,400
And most of that is saturated fat
with some Omega threes mixed in.

867
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:38,750
And what happens there is I can eat
pretty much as much as I can stand and I

868
00:24:38,751 --> 00:24:39,920
won't gain any weight that way.

869
00:24:41,030 --> 00:24:41,660
So it's,

870
00:24:41,660 --> 00:24:44,990
it's simply what causes
obesity isn't one single thing.

871
00:24:45,020 --> 00:24:49,940
But I will tell you one of the unknown
things that is a major contributor is

872
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,620
synthetic estrogen in the environment.

873
00:24:52,220 --> 00:24:54,650
A lot of that comes from
mold in our food supply.

874
00:24:54,710 --> 00:24:55,670
It's called Zarrella known.

875
00:24:55,671 --> 00:24:58,280
We actually purify it and
feed it to industrial beef.

876
00:24:58,520 --> 00:25:00,860
We put it in a little waxy
pellet in the cow's ear.

877
00:25:01,220 --> 00:25:04,700
And here's an example of how much this
stuff works you use around unknown.

878
00:25:04,730 --> 00:25:09,290
It can increase what they call feed
efficiency for livestock by 30% feed

879
00:25:09,291 --> 00:25:12,950
efficiency means if I don't give them
this drug and I give him a pound of food,

880
00:25:12,951 --> 00:25:13,341
they gain,

881
00:25:13,341 --> 00:25:13,880
you know,

882
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:17,900
however many ounces of fat or or
meat that the cow is going to gain.

883
00:25:18,170 --> 00:25:20,510
You put this pellet in their area
changed or hormonal function,

884
00:25:20,540 --> 00:25:23,000
they gain 30% more weight
on the same amount of food.

885
00:25:23,540 --> 00:25:26,450
That stuff is fat soluble
and it bioaccumulates.

886
00:25:26,780 --> 00:25:30,620
You do not want to be eating hormone
treated beef that was treated to get fat

887
00:25:30,650 --> 00:25:31,041
really,

888
00:25:31,041 --> 00:25:31,874
really quickly.

889
00:25:32,540 --> 00:25:35,540
So we know flat out just
because in animal husbandry,

890
00:25:35,541 --> 00:25:37,310
if we can change the calories in,

891
00:25:37,311 --> 00:25:42,311
calories out equation by 30% why couldn't
we do in humans and the answer as we

892
00:25:42,531 --> 00:25:44,090
can and that's why every
time someone tells me,

893
00:25:44,300 --> 00:25:46,400
measure how much you eat and measure
how much you exercise and you'll lose

894
00:25:46,401 --> 00:25:46,910
weight.

895
00:25:46,910 --> 00:25:48,560
It's the biggest myth.

896
00:25:48,561 --> 00:25:50,510
I have the whole a
whole big like research,

897
00:25:50,511 --> 00:25:51,740
like 30 references,

898
00:25:51,830 --> 00:25:53,210
a blog post about that.

899
00:25:53,240 --> 00:25:53,991
It's just not true.

900
00:25:53,991 --> 00:25:54,824
It never was.

901
00:25:54,860 --> 00:25:59,860
So when someone drops their calories
down and exercises and starts losing fat,

902
00:26:01,420 --> 00:26:02,253
what,

903
00:26:02,330 --> 00:26:03,163
what are they doing?

904
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:06,740
You can do it for a little
while but here's what happens
and I can tell you this

905
00:26:06,741 --> 00:26:09,030
cause I did that lots of times
you lose 25 pounds again,

906
00:26:09,050 --> 00:26:10,580
25 pounds to lose 25 pounds.

907
00:26:10,700 --> 00:26:14,210
So it's a slingshot sort of a thing and
there's something called epigenetics and

908
00:26:14,211 --> 00:26:17,750
epigenetics is like one of
the main subject of this
book that I wrote and it's,

909
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:22,340
it's awesome because epigenetic shows how
the environment changes the expression

910
00:26:22,341 --> 00:26:25,760
of your genes and you get signals from
the environment all the time and two of

911
00:26:25,761 --> 00:26:29,300
the biggest signals that you can ever
send your body that changed the way you

912
00:26:29,301 --> 00:26:31,490
actually methalate your DNA are,

913
00:26:31,730 --> 00:26:32,541
there's a threat,

914
00:26:32,541 --> 00:26:34,190
there's something chasing
me and it won't stop.

915
00:26:34,190 --> 00:26:38,180
And you do this by going for a run
every single day without rest instead of

916
00:26:38,181 --> 00:26:41,840
practicing high intensity
interval training or instead
of giving yourself some

917
00:26:41,841 --> 00:26:42,674
recovery time.

918
00:26:42,740 --> 00:26:45,960
There's a lot of athletes and even non
athletes who are just playing overtrained

919
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,540
they don't get enough recovery time to
actually build the muscle up that they

920
00:26:48,541 --> 00:26:51,450
should build cause they had to go rip
it down again by lifting the next day.

921
00:26:51,500 --> 00:26:51,990
Right.

922
00:26:51,990 --> 00:26:52,890
So that's one signal,

923
00:26:52,891 --> 00:26:56,010
which is that like there's a threat to
my species because I keep getting injured

924
00:26:56,011 --> 00:26:56,731
on a daily basis.

925
00:26:56,731 --> 00:26:57,630
I keep having to run.

926
00:26:58,080 --> 00:27:01,830
The other signal you can send is there's
a famine and you tell your body there's

927
00:27:01,831 --> 00:27:04,320
a famine by eating low
calories or low fat diets.

928
00:27:04,630 --> 00:27:05,161
When you do that,

929
00:27:05,161 --> 00:27:06,600
it changes your gene expression.

930
00:27:06,780 --> 00:27:10,680
And we know that people who went through
a famine that their grandkids have a

931
00:27:10,681 --> 00:27:13,260
two to three times higher chance
of getting type two diabetes.

932
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:15,390
This stuff passes down
through the generations.

933
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:16,950
So I'll tell you flat out,

934
00:27:16,951 --> 00:27:17,820
like if you're going on,

935
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:21,600
especially a low fat Vegan Diet
and you're planning to reproduce,

936
00:27:21,630 --> 00:27:23,940
your kids are going to be weaker
than they would have been before.

937
00:27:24,090 --> 00:27:26,100
And the evidence there
is pretty darn strong.

938
00:27:26,170 --> 00:27:27,900
It's a multiple generation of fact.

939
00:27:28,650 --> 00:27:29,483
Wow.

940
00:27:29,490 --> 00:27:32,850
So a Vegan diet is lacking.

941
00:27:32,851 --> 00:27:35,190
And what it's lacking in saturated fat.

942
00:27:35,280 --> 00:27:36,113
For one thing,

943
00:27:36,290 --> 00:27:39,150
a way to make up for it
in with a Vegan Diet,

944
00:27:39,151 --> 00:27:40,140
if you're conscious about it,

945
00:27:40,170 --> 00:27:42,000
you can get some in coconut oil,

946
00:27:42,001 --> 00:27:44,610
but coconut oil does not have
conjugated linoleic acid.

947
00:27:44,611 --> 00:27:48,240
It doesn't have a lot of
the micronutrients that are
present in animal products.

948
00:27:48,660 --> 00:27:51,420
You can probably get by on a vegetarian,

949
00:27:51,421 --> 00:27:52,920
a very careful vegetarian by it,

950
00:27:52,921 --> 00:27:53,754
but diet,

951
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:57,990
but in terms of being like fully optimal
as in kicking ass at the maximum level

952
00:27:57,991 --> 00:27:59,250
of what the human body can do,

953
00:27:59,670 --> 00:28:01,230
it's going to take more
than just egg yolks.

954
00:28:01,230 --> 00:28:04,320
It's going to take some steak and it's
going to take some lamb and it's going to

955
00:28:04,321 --> 00:28:06,390
take some cod liver oil
and things like that.

956
00:28:06,810 --> 00:28:08,400
If you're going to be 100% Vegan.

957
00:28:08,401 --> 00:28:09,270
I honestly,

958
00:28:09,300 --> 00:28:11,400
I know enough people now
who've posted on my blogs,

959
00:28:11,401 --> 00:28:12,750
even some close personal friends.

960
00:28:13,140 --> 00:28:13,320
Uh,

961
00:28:13,320 --> 00:28:14,880
one of them was a black belt in Aikido.

962
00:28:15,030 --> 00:28:17,610
He went vegan and 18 months later
he's allergic to everything.

963
00:28:17,611 --> 00:28:18,361
Like you had to go back.

964
00:28:18,361 --> 00:28:18,660
But it,

965
00:28:18,660 --> 00:28:20,640
it seriously just decimated as health.

966
00:28:21,030 --> 00:28:21,830
So it's,

967
00:28:21,830 --> 00:28:23,010
it's a careful thing to do,

968
00:28:23,070 --> 00:28:26,660
but I know people who do and they're
very healthy guys like Mack Dansik,

969
00:28:26,670 --> 00:28:28,080
he's very healthy and he's uh,

970
00:28:28,100 --> 00:28:29,370
he's been a Vegan for years.

971
00:28:29,430 --> 00:28:31,350
There definitely are
some very healthy vegans.

972
00:28:31,351 --> 00:28:33,030
I'm friends with some Erin Simpson,

973
00:28:33,031 --> 00:28:34,140
one of the guys are fights in the UFC.

974
00:28:34,141 --> 00:28:34,831
Very healthy guy.

975
00:28:34,831 --> 00:28:35,664
He's a Vegan.

976
00:28:35,970 --> 00:28:36,630
Um,

977
00:28:36,630 --> 00:28:37,463
how old are these guys?

978
00:28:37,830 --> 00:28:39,150
Aaron I think is 36.

979
00:28:39,151 --> 00:28:41,970
37 so I'm really curious
when I was younger,

980
00:28:41,980 --> 00:28:43,050
what their blood work looks like,

981
00:28:43,051 --> 00:28:44,970
I'd love to see like an antiaging
panel from one of those guys.

982
00:28:44,971 --> 00:28:46,440
I don't know if any of
them has ever posted it,

983
00:28:46,441 --> 00:28:49,170
but I'd love to just go through it and
look at their triglycerides from all the

984
00:28:49,171 --> 00:28:50,004
fructose they eat.

985
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:50,430
I mean,

986
00:28:50,430 --> 00:28:52,000
that's one serious thing.

987
00:28:52,001 --> 00:28:53,040
There's c reactive protein.

988
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:55,620
Every antiaging physician
I've worked with,

989
00:28:55,621 --> 00:28:56,251
and when I say that,

990
00:28:56,251 --> 00:28:59,610
I run an antiaging nonprofit group
called Silicon Valley Health Institute,

991
00:28:59,611 --> 00:29:01,830
SUV ahi.com or.org.

992
00:29:02,550 --> 00:29:03,720
We've been around for 19 years,

993
00:29:03,721 --> 00:29:05,580
bringing guys in like Aubrey de grey,

994
00:29:05,610 --> 00:29:10,610
other like big time antiaging people
to give lectures and to a tee,

995
00:29:10,681 --> 00:29:13,410
every single one of them
except one has said flat out,

996
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:18,120
I won't take a Vegan patient because
I cannot make them age less quickly.

997
00:29:18,121 --> 00:29:19,200
Like it just doesn't work.

998
00:29:19,201 --> 00:29:22,440
And these are the guys who like see
10 patients a day with carefully

999
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:24,000
demonstrated panels.

1000
00:29:24,130 --> 00:29:24,480
It,

1001
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:25,890
the bottom line is it's,

1002
00:29:25,950 --> 00:29:27,480
I would love it if the Vegan diet was,

1003
00:29:27,481 --> 00:29:28,680
was safe and effective.

1004
00:29:28,890 --> 00:29:33,660
I was a raw vegan for about four
months and after that I became a Ra,

1005
00:29:33,720 --> 00:29:37,440
omnivore for another six or seven months
before I went off to Tibet and China.

1006
00:29:37,470 --> 00:29:39,270
I'm not eating raw yak and into bed.

1007
00:29:39,690 --> 00:29:40,260
No,

1008
00:29:40,260 --> 00:29:40,800
no.

1009
00:29:40,800 --> 00:29:41,350
I,

1010
00:29:41,350 --> 00:29:41,500
yeah,

1011
00:29:41,500 --> 00:29:43,030
it was kind of hanging
out from the mud wall.

1012
00:29:43,031 --> 00:29:43,640
I'm like,

1013
00:29:43,640 --> 00:29:44,473
you better cook that

1014
00:29:47,100 --> 00:29:47,910
Yak.

1015
00:29:47,910 --> 00:29:48,380
Huh?

1016
00:29:48,380 --> 00:29:49,213
Was He actually sorry.

1017
00:29:49,750 --> 00:29:50,460
It's actually awesome.

1018
00:29:50,460 --> 00:29:51,760
Some of the best meat I've ever had.

1019
00:29:51,790 --> 00:29:52,211
It's really,

1020
00:29:52,211 --> 00:29:53,560
it's better than grass fed beef.

1021
00:29:53,590 --> 00:29:55,480
Even like the best Primo grassfed.

1022
00:29:55,540 --> 00:29:56,081
Really?

1023
00:29:56,081 --> 00:29:56,410
Yeah.

1024
00:29:56,410 --> 00:29:56,960
Yeah.

1025
00:29:56,960 --> 00:29:57,500
Huh?

1026
00:29:57,500 --> 00:29:59,350
What do you think people
would know about that?

1027
00:29:59,410 --> 00:29:59,561
Well,

1028
00:29:59,561 --> 00:30:02,680
the problem is it only eats some kind of
weird moss that grows at high altitude

1029
00:30:02,681 --> 00:30:04,150
and it dies when you
bring it to low altitude.

1030
00:30:04,151 --> 00:30:05,710
So it's kind of a constrained supply.

1031
00:30:06,250 --> 00:30:07,083
Oh Wow.

1032
00:30:07,870 --> 00:30:10,120
That's fascinating to
seriously tough animal though.

1033
00:30:10,390 --> 00:30:11,470
Jakks yeah,

1034
00:30:11,530 --> 00:30:11,981
I mean they're,

1035
00:30:11,981 --> 00:30:12,850
they're ginormous.

1036
00:30:12,851 --> 00:30:14,290
Like most of the things
you see are only half.

1037
00:30:14,291 --> 00:30:14,470
Yeah,

1038
00:30:14,470 --> 00:30:15,011
calf cow.

1039
00:30:15,011 --> 00:30:16,750
But the real ones are bigger than a camp.

1040
00:30:16,790 --> 00:30:17,070
Tangy.

1041
00:30:17,070 --> 00:30:17,621
Tastes good.

1042
00:30:17,621 --> 00:30:19,150
I would think they'd be like real gamey.

1043
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:19,440
Yeah.

1044
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:20,273
Funky.

1045
00:30:20,790 --> 00:30:21,623
Yeah.

1046
00:30:21,790 --> 00:30:23,370
Pizza Yag Layman,

1047
00:30:23,371 --> 00:30:23,890
you know.

1048
00:30:23,890 --> 00:30:24,723
Oh yeah,

1049
00:30:24,750 --> 00:30:25,583
it was awesome.

1050
00:30:27,820 --> 00:30:32,820
So this is an incredibly fascinating
subject to me because I've always wondered

1051
00:30:34,540 --> 00:30:37,690
like what it is about certain people,

1052
00:30:37,691 --> 00:30:42,691
they store so much fat and certain
people just stay lean no matter what.

1053
00:30:42,850 --> 00:30:43,391
Some of that,

1054
00:30:43,391 --> 00:30:44,680
obviously it's genetics,

1055
00:30:45,230 --> 00:30:50,110
but what is wrong with their diet
that takes a person and just,

1056
00:30:50,140 --> 00:30:53,170
it blows them up to three 5,400 pounds.

1057
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:53,900
I mean,

1058
00:30:53,900 --> 00:30:54,290
it's,

1059
00:30:54,290 --> 00:30:55,460
there's gotta be a,

1060
00:30:55,730 --> 00:30:56,590
this is a critical issue,

1061
00:30:56,591 --> 00:30:56,801
right?

1062
00:30:56,801 --> 00:30:57,634
Is it sugar?

1063
00:30:57,880 --> 00:30:58,510
Is it a,

1064
00:30:58,510 --> 00:31:00,880
what is it as imposters and
carbs that turn to sugar?

1065
00:31:00,940 --> 00:31:02,950
It's actually sugar plus inflammation.

1066
00:31:03,130 --> 00:31:04,930
So it's that combination of Omega six,

1067
00:31:04,931 --> 00:31:08,800
like excess Omega six oils plus sugar
and corn syrup and things like that.

1068
00:31:09,010 --> 00:31:12,650
What you're doing is you're basically
just just completely wrecking the

1069
00:31:12,651 --> 00:31:13,900
metabolism when you do that.

1070
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:17,830
A mega six oils have lots
of polyunsaturated bonds.

1071
00:31:17,831 --> 00:31:19,120
I'm talking corn oil,

1072
00:31:19,121 --> 00:31:19,841
canola oil,

1073
00:31:19,841 --> 00:31:20,674
stuff like that,

1074
00:31:21,130 --> 00:31:22,240
and vegetable oil,

1075
00:31:22,570 --> 00:31:23,291
what happens,

1076
00:31:23,291 --> 00:31:24,550
their soils and other one,

1077
00:31:25,330 --> 00:31:30,160
every unsaturated bond in that oil can
oxidize and what oxidizes it is oxygen,

1078
00:31:30,161 --> 00:31:31,240
heat and light.

1079
00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:34,510
So most of these roles get
oxidized before you even eat them.

1080
00:31:34,511 --> 00:31:38,080
But in the body you try and make cell
walls out of them and when that happens

1081
00:31:38,110 --> 00:31:41,650
you end up with less flexible cell walls
that aren't able to express the insulin

1082
00:31:41,651 --> 00:31:42,520
receptors very well.

1083
00:31:42,590 --> 00:31:43,030
Right.

1084
00:31:43,030 --> 00:31:47,890
So we ended up with lots of problems like
that because we ended up getting these

1085
00:31:48,280 --> 00:31:51,070
oils that oxidize easily when
they're oxidized inside the body,

1086
00:31:51,071 --> 00:31:51,990
they make free radicals.

1087
00:31:51,991 --> 00:31:55,570
So you get general systemic inflammation
and you can measure these levels.

1088
00:31:55,571 --> 00:31:58,870
Like if you take a Vegan and you look
at their Omega six to Omega three ratio,

1089
00:31:59,320 --> 00:32:04,320
it can be 30 40 to one the
average American on a crap
industrial meat diet is at

1090
00:32:05,681 --> 00:32:06,820
40 to one right now.

1091
00:32:06,850 --> 00:32:11,200
My blood levels are 1.28 to one of my
Omega six to Omega three ratios and that

1092
00:32:11,201 --> 00:32:14,710
helps me to crank my inflammation way
down and it helps me to express healthy

1093
00:32:14,711 --> 00:32:17,620
insulin receptors so I don't
get insulin resistance.

1094
00:32:17,620 --> 00:32:20,110
I don't get Leptin
resistance and that lets me,

1095
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:21,370
even now I could go out,

1096
00:32:21,371 --> 00:32:23,350
I can eat a relatively heavy sugar meal.

1097
00:32:23,500 --> 00:32:26,560
I don't get a coma from it even though
I used to get a coma from it when I

1098
00:32:26,561 --> 00:32:28,570
weighed 280 pounds or 300 pounds.

1099
00:32:29,290 --> 00:32:32,680
I can also go 18 hours without eating
and it doesn't bother me in the slightest

1100
00:32:32,980 --> 00:32:34,690
and that's a pretty big difference from,

1101
00:32:34,691 --> 00:32:35,370
I used to be the guy,

1102
00:32:35,370 --> 00:32:35,561
I'm like,

1103
00:32:35,561 --> 00:32:37,140
it's 1145 I got to,

1104
00:32:37,150 --> 00:32:37,450
I got,

1105
00:32:37,450 --> 00:32:40,390
we got to end this meeting right now
because I have to eat because if I need it

1106
00:32:40,391 --> 00:32:41,224
I'm going to kill someone.

1107
00:32:42,020 --> 00:32:43,370
You can go 18 hours.

1108
00:32:43,700 --> 00:32:43,961
Yeah.

1109
00:32:43,961 --> 00:32:45,110
In fact I did it yesterday.

1110
00:32:45,170 --> 00:32:45,471
Yeah.

1111
00:32:45,471 --> 00:32:48,500
I had my last meal at 4:00 PM last
night and then again at two today.

1112
00:32:48,501 --> 00:32:50,180
I guess that was a little
more than 22 hours.

1113
00:32:50,230 --> 00:32:50,390
No.

1114
00:32:50,390 --> 00:32:53,240
What do you say about people that say
that you should have like some sort of a

1115
00:32:53,241 --> 00:32:54,340
post workout?

1116
00:32:54,460 --> 00:32:55,100
Um,

1117
00:32:55,100 --> 00:32:56,360
sugary meal,

1118
00:32:56,361 --> 00:32:58,040
some like a lot of glucose,

1119
00:32:58,041 --> 00:32:58,701
high glucose,

1120
00:32:58,701 --> 00:32:59,540
a little bit of protein.

1121
00:32:59,541 --> 00:33:00,410
What do you think about that?

1122
00:33:00,530 --> 00:33:03,440
I looked at that and what you're trying
to do there is you're trying to spike

1123
00:33:03,441 --> 00:33:05,330
your insulin afterwards
because the insulin,

1124
00:33:05,500 --> 00:33:09,260
we have insulin like growth factor
IGF one which has caused you to build

1125
00:33:09,261 --> 00:33:09,740
muscles.

1126
00:33:09,740 --> 00:33:11,960
It's insulin light cause it has
the same effects as insulin.

1127
00:33:11,961 --> 00:33:15,350
So you had a lot of sugar spike your
insulin allegedly lay down more muscle.

1128
00:33:15,950 --> 00:33:19,130
There's a couple of studies I've seen and
I can't cite sources from memory right

1129
00:33:19,131 --> 00:33:19,670
now,

1130
00:33:19,670 --> 00:33:21,170
but what I,

1131
00:33:21,220 --> 00:33:24,410
what I recall from seeing them is that
it looks like the effect and Igf one

1132
00:33:24,411 --> 00:33:26,240
probably isn't as good
as you'd like it to be.

1133
00:33:26,660 --> 00:33:31,310
What I do after I work out is I
typically have a good amount of protein,

1134
00:33:31,520 --> 00:33:34,400
a good amount of fat and some starch,

1135
00:33:34,430 --> 00:33:35,001
not a lot,

1136
00:33:35,001 --> 00:33:36,500
and I choose low toxin starches,

1137
00:33:36,501 --> 00:33:37,400
which is kind of hard to do.

1138
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:40,250
I've got the bulletproof diet up
on the site where it's a free,

1139
00:33:40,251 --> 00:33:44,390
but it's an infographic that basically
ranks foods based on three criteria and

1140
00:33:44,391 --> 00:33:45,680
if you get a bulletproof starch,

1141
00:33:45,681 --> 00:33:49,940
like a white rice that's properly
rents in cooked or a sweet potatoes,

1142
00:33:49,970 --> 00:33:50,751
butternut squash,

1143
00:33:50,751 --> 00:33:51,584
things like that,

1144
00:33:51,680 --> 00:33:55,310
what you're doing is you're getting your
carbs up enough that you can still even

1145
00:33:55,311 --> 00:33:56,630
stay in a state of ketosis.

1146
00:33:56,631 --> 00:33:56,961
Maybe,

1147
00:33:56,961 --> 00:33:57,794
maybe not.

1148
00:33:57,890 --> 00:34:01,430
But what you can do there is you can
reduce your stress hormone levels and that

1149
00:34:01,431 --> 00:34:03,680
eating right after you
work out drops cortisol.

1150
00:34:03,800 --> 00:34:07,430
If your cortisol doesn't get
dropped in that postworkout window,

1151
00:34:07,670 --> 00:34:10,070
you get a cortisol spike
that lasts for 48 hours,

1152
00:34:10,110 --> 00:34:11,630
so you're not going to get as much muscle.

1153
00:34:11,900 --> 00:34:13,280
It's absolutely critical to eat.

1154
00:34:13,281 --> 00:34:15,500
But do you need sugar or do
you need protein and fat?

1155
00:34:15,530 --> 00:34:18,320
I would tend towards protein and
fat with a small amount of starch.

1156
00:34:19,010 --> 00:34:22,700
So how did it get started that people
learned how to drink chocolate milk?

1157
00:34:22,790 --> 00:34:26,480
That was like the big thing for awhile
it was like chocolate milk is the best

1158
00:34:26,481 --> 00:34:27,500
post workout drink.

1159
00:34:28,130 --> 00:34:31,070
You know there's effects
from milk on IGF one as well.

1160
00:34:31,071 --> 00:34:34,090
Like milk will cause you to put on weight
because you to put on fat to build.

1161
00:34:34,220 --> 00:34:35,120
If you want to look up,

1162
00:34:35,210 --> 00:34:37,010
you know milk works for bulking up.

1163
00:34:37,310 --> 00:34:38,270
Why chocolate milk?

1164
00:34:38,271 --> 00:34:38,961
Because someone said,

1165
00:34:38,961 --> 00:34:40,070
oh it's raising the insulin some more,

1166
00:34:40,071 --> 00:34:41,390
but kind of look at
what's in chocolate milk.

1167
00:34:41,480 --> 00:34:43,100
At least make your own
with real chocolate.

1168
00:34:43,640 --> 00:34:44,473
What is in chocolate?

1169
00:34:44,750 --> 00:34:46,190
It's usually high fructose corn syrup.

1170
00:34:46,280 --> 00:34:47,840
Like terrible for you.

1171
00:34:47,841 --> 00:34:48,111
Yeah.

1172
00:34:48,111 --> 00:34:51,530
And plus you've got problems
with when you homogenized milk,

1173
00:34:51,980 --> 00:34:55,820
you take those fat droplets that your
body really needs and you put them through

1174
00:34:55,821 --> 00:34:57,740
a super fine screen under pressure,

1175
00:34:57,920 --> 00:35:01,010
which makes these extremely
fine fat droplets that your
body doesn't know how to

1176
00:35:01,011 --> 00:35:01,380
handle.

1177
00:35:01,380 --> 00:35:02,570
They can actually enter cells.

1178
00:35:02,690 --> 00:35:06,560
So imaginization can increase inflammation
and it causes weird fat reactions

1179
00:35:06,561 --> 00:35:08,330
that that your body's not ready for.

1180
00:35:08,840 --> 00:35:10,460
And also when they pasteurize the milk,

1181
00:35:10,550 --> 00:35:15,550
you get a case in and case
is an inflammatory compounds
depending on how it's

1182
00:35:16,161 --> 00:35:16,611
processed.

1183
00:35:16,611 --> 00:35:18,080
But it's a very careful protein.

1184
00:35:18,081 --> 00:35:20,570
I don't need any case and I know lots of
people who are just playing allergic to

1185
00:35:20,571 --> 00:35:24,890
it and I mean you've probably had people
in here talking about the China study.

1186
00:35:25,370 --> 00:35:27,800
That was an incredibly
misrepresentative book,

1187
00:35:28,010 --> 00:35:31,610
but one of the key points at the very
beginning was that case and can increase

1188
00:35:31,611 --> 00:35:33,350
inflammation and be
linked to liver cancer.

1189
00:35:33,351 --> 00:35:34,190
And that's actually true.

1190
00:35:34,520 --> 00:35:35,390
So man,

1191
00:35:35,420 --> 00:35:36,410
in order to get some protein,

1192
00:35:36,411 --> 00:35:39,540
you're getting case which
has been pasteurized.

1193
00:35:39,541 --> 00:35:40,980
You're getting fat and the wrong form,

1194
00:35:40,981 --> 00:35:42,120
you're getting high fructose corn syrup.

1195
00:35:42,450 --> 00:35:46,290
I could probably formulate a better
post workout drink using MCT oil,

1196
00:35:46,380 --> 00:35:48,120
like bulletproof flow talks and chocolate.

1197
00:35:48,120 --> 00:35:49,800
Maybe you could use honey.

1198
00:35:49,830 --> 00:35:54,510
Even like raw honey has a different effect
than say normal sugar does and normal

1199
00:35:54,511 --> 00:35:56,280
sugar has a different effect
on high fructose corn syrup.

1200
00:35:56,730 --> 00:35:58,740
What is the deal was corn?

1201
00:35:58,770 --> 00:35:59,071
Why?

1202
00:35:59,071 --> 00:36:00,510
Why do we use so much corn?

1203
00:36:00,570 --> 00:36:04,440
It's high fructose corn syrup and corn
is in so many different to everywhere.

1204
00:36:04,710 --> 00:36:06,180
Is that a lobby thing?

1205
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:06,860
Is that,

1206
00:36:06,860 --> 00:36:07,170
yup.

1207
00:36:07,170 --> 00:36:09,960
Corn and soy are lobby things
and also farm subsidies,

1208
00:36:09,961 --> 00:36:10,550
right?

1209
00:36:10,550 --> 00:36:10,791
You know,

1210
00:36:10,791 --> 00:36:12,180
you grow corn and soy,

1211
00:36:12,270 --> 00:36:14,730
you get extra money from the
government for growing this stuff.

1212
00:36:15,130 --> 00:36:16,980
We've got the whole
Monsanto connection there,

1213
00:36:16,981 --> 00:36:18,540
which is just beyond evil.

1214
00:36:18,541 --> 00:36:19,500
From my perspective,

1215
00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:21,360
it's confusing,

1216
00:36:21,560 --> 00:36:23,010
very confusing that it's real.

1217
00:36:23,070 --> 00:36:23,970
It's very confusing.

1218
00:36:23,980 --> 00:36:27,390
If there's a company out there that's
trying to make these genetically modified

1219
00:36:27,391 --> 00:36:29,460
food and then force farmers to grow them.

1220
00:36:29,461 --> 00:36:31,710
And when you see the
suicide rates in India,

1221
00:36:31,770 --> 00:36:31,990
they're,

1222
00:36:31,990 --> 00:36:33,780
they're absolutely stunning.

1223
00:36:34,230 --> 00:36:36,960
I mean it's like they're having
suicides there every day.

1224
00:36:36,961 --> 00:36:37,920
All Day long.

1225
00:36:37,950 --> 00:36:39,570
People are killing themselves
because of Monsanto.

1226
00:36:39,571 --> 00:36:44,100
There's been hundreds of thousands of
suicides in India link to Monsanto.

1227
00:36:44,340 --> 00:36:44,640
It's,

1228
00:36:44,640 --> 00:36:45,650
it's really crazy.

1229
00:36:45,660 --> 00:36:46,710
These poor farmers,

1230
00:36:47,230 --> 00:36:49,650
there's even more profound evil going on.

1231
00:36:49,651 --> 00:36:51,060
And one of my pet peeves,

1232
00:36:51,061 --> 00:36:54,120
things I talk about and I've studied
extensively is called mycotoxins.

1233
00:36:54,121 --> 00:36:56,520
And these are toxins that form
from fungus in the environment.

1234
00:36:57,150 --> 00:37:01,230
And the combination of dupont
plus Monsanto is a shocking story.

1235
00:37:01,470 --> 00:37:02,580
Like 30 years ago,

1236
00:37:02,850 --> 00:37:05,400
dupont made this pesticide
called Benno mill.

1237
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:08,580
And what been a mill did
is it killed all fungus,

1238
00:37:08,581 --> 00:37:10,050
like 98% of fungus it touched,

1239
00:37:10,051 --> 00:37:10,884
which is die.

1240
00:37:10,950 --> 00:37:14,280
Unfortunately the other 2% would
get like x man mutation turned on.

1241
00:37:14,520 --> 00:37:16,530
So whole plasmid level
mutation it's called.

1242
00:37:16,531 --> 00:37:19,380
What this means is that instead of
one gene mutating like nature does,

1243
00:37:19,530 --> 00:37:21,960
whole groups or deans
would mutate and get this.

1244
00:37:21,990 --> 00:37:23,700
A fungus can change plasmids,

1245
00:37:23,730 --> 00:37:25,680
plasmids like baseball
cards with other fungus.

1246
00:37:26,010 --> 00:37:29,250
So what's going on here is we create
an x men fungus that reproduce every 20

1247
00:37:29,251 --> 00:37:30,300
minutes 30 years ago,

1248
00:37:30,570 --> 00:37:33,600
and some of these new toxic
molds that are like Uber vicious,

1249
00:37:33,601 --> 00:37:34,021
you know that,

1250
00:37:34,021 --> 00:37:37,110
that poisoned people in their houses
and all I've had that happen to me,

1251
00:37:37,530 --> 00:37:37,711
you know,

1252
00:37:37,711 --> 00:37:41,010
Stacie buttress and Aspergillus in your
kitchen will mess your head up sometimes

1253
00:37:41,011 --> 00:37:41,844
permanently.

1254
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:45,570
And what's going on is
Ben a made these toxic,

1255
00:37:45,571 --> 00:37:47,250
but then you spray roundup on soil.

1256
00:37:47,430 --> 00:37:49,920
Roundup completely
disrupts the soil microbes.

1257
00:37:49,921 --> 00:37:51,480
These are like the
probiotics of the planet.

1258
00:37:51,481 --> 00:37:53,250
Like our soil health is really important.

1259
00:37:53,580 --> 00:37:57,300
So now you get mutated x men stuff growing
in the soil and then you piss it off

1260
00:37:57,301 --> 00:37:57,950
with roundup.

1261
00:37:57,950 --> 00:38:02,950
You get 500 times more toxins and then
that mold that's left fusarium grows in

1262
00:38:03,151 --> 00:38:03,840
the corn.

1263
00:38:03,840 --> 00:38:04,141
In fact,

1264
00:38:04,141 --> 00:38:05,130
it's a major pests.

1265
00:38:05,190 --> 00:38:09,420
It's a major pest for corn in the u s you
get dried corn with toxic mold forming

1266
00:38:09,421 --> 00:38:10,254
fusarium in it.

1267
00:38:10,440 --> 00:38:12,240
It a majorly large percentage.

1268
00:38:12,241 --> 00:38:13,200
I don't know for this year,

1269
00:38:13,290 --> 00:38:16,680
some years it's up to 98% of corn
has this toxic mold growing in it.

1270
00:38:16,710 --> 00:38:17,460
What?

1271
00:38:17,460 --> 00:38:18,360
It's crazy stuff.

1272
00:38:18,361 --> 00:38:20,340
And this is not like any kind of weird,

1273
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:21,001
you know,

1274
00:38:21,001 --> 00:38:22,080
conspiracy theory thing.

1275
00:38:22,110 --> 00:38:24,060
This is documented in
agricultural science,

1276
00:38:24,061 --> 00:38:26,070
just known in biochemistry that I know of,

1277
00:38:26,071 --> 00:38:29,130
tends to read the studies on
mycotoxins cause they're all like often

1278
00:38:29,131 --> 00:38:30,810
agricultural land
instead of unhealth land.

1279
00:38:31,170 --> 00:38:36,170
So you're saying that 98% of corn has
this microtoxin in it and it's not killed

1280
00:38:37,571 --> 00:38:42,370
by any production process turning into
bread or turning it into corn bread or

1281
00:38:42,371 --> 00:38:43,750
tortillas or anything like that?

1282
00:38:43,780 --> 00:38:44,830
It's a micro,

1283
00:38:44,831 --> 00:38:45,660
not micro.

1284
00:38:45,660 --> 00:38:47,470
I'm Yco like as in Miko,

1285
00:38:47,471 --> 00:38:48,490
like mushroom derived.

1286
00:38:48,490 --> 00:38:48,650
Yeah,

1287
00:38:48,650 --> 00:38:49,151
like my sales.

1288
00:38:49,151 --> 00:38:49,810
Right.

1289
00:38:49,810 --> 00:38:51,370
And some of it is killed.

1290
00:38:51,580 --> 00:38:53,290
We've heard of these mycotoxins before.

1291
00:38:53,291 --> 00:38:54,071
Aflatoxin.

1292
00:38:54,071 --> 00:38:56,500
Everyone knows that's a bad
one in peanuts or penicillin,

1293
00:38:56,680 --> 00:38:58,200
like a tiny little little capsule.

1294
00:38:58,210 --> 00:38:58,661
Penicillin,

1295
00:38:58,661 --> 00:39:01,750
which has just mold extract has
this profound effect on your body,

1296
00:39:01,751 --> 00:39:02,290
right?

1297
00:39:02,290 --> 00:39:02,621
Well,

1298
00:39:02,621 --> 00:39:05,560
there's other stuff out there that has a
profound effect on your body at a parts

1299
00:39:05,561 --> 00:39:06,640
per million level.

1300
00:39:07,060 --> 00:39:09,730
And I don't know if this
year 98% of corn is,

1301
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:11,620
that's the maximum I found in my data,

1302
00:39:11,830 --> 00:39:15,880
but at least a third almost every year
in the u s of corn of dried corn product

1303
00:39:15,881 --> 00:39:17,260
that's out there like animal feed,

1304
00:39:17,470 --> 00:39:18,221
like Masa,

1305
00:39:18,221 --> 00:39:20,440
like corn tortillas has stuff in it.

1306
00:39:20,441 --> 00:39:20,690
And for,

1307
00:39:20,690 --> 00:39:20,891
sorry,

1308
00:39:20,891 --> 00:39:24,100
I missed three classes of toxins that
mess with your brain and with your

1309
00:39:24,101 --> 00:39:25,540
hormones and with your protein formation.

1310
00:39:25,840 --> 00:39:28,150
And that's why on the bulletproof diet,

1311
00:39:28,870 --> 00:39:33,010
I look first at macronutrients and then
I look at anti nutrients like mycotoxins

1312
00:39:33,011 --> 00:39:34,840
and hitch heterocyclic
amines and all the others.

1313
00:39:34,980 --> 00:39:37,750
And you gotta be a little careful in
your food if you want to like really kick

1314
00:39:37,751 --> 00:39:39,820
ass and be mentally focused all the time.

1315
00:39:40,300 --> 00:39:42,760
These are the things that get in
there and muck with your head.

1316
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:44,560
Some people are more
sensitive than others,

1317
00:39:44,770 --> 00:39:46,690
but if you reduce the level
of these things in your diet,

1318
00:39:46,691 --> 00:39:50,290
you think better and that's one reason
you do the bulletproof diet in the

1319
00:39:50,290 --> 00:39:50,590
morning.

1320
00:39:50,590 --> 00:39:53,410
All you're drinking with bulletproof
intermittent fasting is low toxin coffee,

1321
00:39:53,530 --> 00:39:55,930
low talks and butter
and toxin free MCT oil.

1322
00:39:56,200 --> 00:39:56,830
You do that.

1323
00:39:56,830 --> 00:39:58,570
You've had nothing messing with your head.

1324
00:39:58,600 --> 00:39:59,433
Only good stuff,

1325
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:00,273
no bad stuff.

1326
00:40:01,330 --> 00:40:05,170
Dad is absolutely fascinating
so everyone's being poisoned.

1327
00:40:05,171 --> 00:40:05,860
Essentially.

1328
00:40:05,860 --> 00:40:08,350
Everyone who's eating all these
corn products is being poisoned.

1329
00:40:08,370 --> 00:40:08,650
Yup.

1330
00:40:08,650 --> 00:40:13,650
At low levels they are and the links
between heart disease and cancer and

1331
00:40:13,871 --> 00:40:16,030
mycotoxins are very well established.

1332
00:40:16,270 --> 00:40:17,103
In fact,

1333
00:40:17,230 --> 00:40:22,230
the WHO researcher who's written the most
research of anyone on Mycotoxins as a

1334
00:40:22,481 --> 00:40:22,990
whole book,

1335
00:40:22,990 --> 00:40:23,823
this thick,

1336
00:40:24,020 --> 00:40:24,220
uh,

1337
00:40:24,220 --> 00:40:28,180
called Fungal bionics where he cites
900 different studies about the links

1338
00:40:28,181 --> 00:40:29,740
between atherosclerosis and cancer.

1339
00:40:29,830 --> 00:40:30,663
That's heart disease.

1340
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:32,290
Direct quote from this author.

1341
00:40:32,560 --> 00:40:36,790
He says there was a known cause of
atherosclerosis and it is mycotoxins.

1342
00:40:37,600 --> 00:40:38,590
Pig farmers know this.

1343
00:40:38,620 --> 00:40:42,070
They know that if they get great these
grains that have mold growing in them,

1344
00:40:42,220 --> 00:40:45,310
they have test kits they can buy where
they test the grain because they know

1345
00:40:45,311 --> 00:40:47,140
they feed too much grain
to the key to the pigs.

1346
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:50,770
The pigs will get lesions
in their arteries or the
pigs will lose their litter

1347
00:40:50,771 --> 00:40:51,880
before they can deliver it.

1348
00:40:52,240 --> 00:40:55,390
But what they do is they wait until
the pigs are far enough along.

1349
00:40:55,391 --> 00:40:59,590
Then they feed the cheaper toxic grain
to the pigs or the cows and that fattens

1350
00:40:59,591 --> 00:41:01,780
them up faster and it costs less money.

1351
00:41:01,781 --> 00:41:04,480
And the fact that some of that stuff
is still in the meet your problem.

1352
00:41:05,080 --> 00:41:05,710
Wow.

1353
00:41:05,710 --> 00:41:08,590
So when you're getting pork chops
are getting it cause they grain,

1354
00:41:08,620 --> 00:41:10,360
it all depends on who fed the pig.

1355
00:41:10,660 --> 00:41:11,500
Jesus Christ.

1356
00:41:11,650 --> 00:41:13,780
So when you're getting
steak you're getting that.

1357
00:41:14,160 --> 00:41:15,460
If you're not eating grass fed steak,

1358
00:41:15,490 --> 00:41:16,420
you're making a mistake.

1359
00:41:16,540 --> 00:41:18,430
And that's one of the reasons
you go on a Vegan Diet.

1360
00:41:18,730 --> 00:41:20,290
If you're eating really good quality,

1361
00:41:20,291 --> 00:41:21,490
non Moldy Vegan food,

1362
00:41:21,491 --> 00:41:22,750
you're going to get less toxins.

1363
00:41:22,751 --> 00:41:26,470
Like you compare a Vegan or vegetarian
versus standard industrial meat based,

1364
00:41:26,500 --> 00:41:26,740
you know,

1365
00:41:26,740 --> 00:41:29,560
meat and hydrogenated
fat and Msg Diet Man,

1366
00:41:29,590 --> 00:41:32,650
I would rather be a Vegan then a standard
American diet any day of the week.

1367
00:41:32,920 --> 00:41:34,130
The problem is that if I want to

1368
00:41:34,130 --> 00:41:34,761
for many,

1369
00:41:34,761 --> 00:41:37,120
many years have the highest energy levels,

1370
00:41:37,130 --> 00:41:39,740
the most focused with the
least amount of effort,

1371
00:41:40,040 --> 00:41:42,410
you're not going to be able to achieve
that on the Vegan diet and I don't think

1372
00:41:42,411 --> 00:41:45,770
you'll hit your very top level of
performance as a hundred percent Vegan.

1373
00:41:45,771 --> 00:41:46,940
You could probably be mostly Vegan,

1374
00:41:46,941 --> 00:41:48,740
but you're going to be missing
out on some things over time.

1375
00:41:48,980 --> 00:41:51,080
Like there's pretty good
research on my side about that.

1376
00:41:52,240 --> 00:41:52,900
This is,

1377
00:41:52,900 --> 00:41:53,130
it's,

1378
00:41:53,130 --> 00:41:54,950
it's unbelievable that you,

1379
00:41:54,970 --> 00:41:56,300
you sound so convincing,

1380
00:41:56,301 --> 00:41:57,830
but I'm too stupid to
know if you're right.

1381
00:41:59,510 --> 00:42:01,310
There's a lot of convincing
vegans out there too.

1382
00:42:01,370 --> 00:42:01,731
Yes,

1383
00:42:01,731 --> 00:42:02,121
there are.

1384
00:42:02,121 --> 00:42:02,361
Well,

1385
00:42:02,361 --> 00:42:04,850
you know there's a lot of people that
tell you how much it changed their life,

1386
00:42:04,851 --> 00:42:08,990
but my point is with a lot of
those peoples that generally,

1387
00:42:09,300 --> 00:42:10,250
there's not all,

1388
00:42:10,251 --> 00:42:13,880
but generally they come from a really
bad diet and then they start eating your

1389
00:42:13,881 --> 00:42:15,020
vegetables and they feel better.

1390
00:42:15,290 --> 00:42:15,411
Well,

1391
00:42:15,411 --> 00:42:16,370
of course you're going to feel better,

1392
00:42:16,700 --> 00:42:17,780
but I think your point,

1393
00:42:17,910 --> 00:42:21,050
it really does make a lot
of sense as to what is,

1394
00:42:21,080 --> 00:42:22,730
what is the optimum way to do it.

1395
00:42:22,760 --> 00:42:24,680
This is all stuff that
I'd never heard before.

1396
00:42:24,950 --> 00:42:28,400
I'd never heard it all meet has
some sort of low level Mike,

1397
00:42:28,460 --> 00:42:29,210
Michael,

1398
00:42:29,210 --> 00:42:29,840
Miko,

1399
00:42:29,840 --> 00:42:30,561
mycotoxins,

1400
00:42:30,561 --> 00:42:31,310
mycotoxins,

1401
00:42:31,310 --> 00:42:32,960
but it's the only
industrial meat like the,

1402
00:42:33,080 --> 00:42:34,310
I have a half account in my fridge.

1403
00:42:34,340 --> 00:42:35,900
It grew up three miles from my house.

1404
00:42:36,020 --> 00:42:39,590
It costs $3 and 50 cents a
pound and it's grass fed.

1405
00:42:39,620 --> 00:42:40,970
It never ate any grain.

1406
00:42:41,090 --> 00:42:41,930
It was well treated.

1407
00:42:41,931 --> 00:42:44,270
It was butchered humanely
and it tastes awesome.

1408
00:42:44,390 --> 00:42:46,880
Like he's really good meat and
I to do you have a big freezer?

1409
00:42:47,030 --> 00:42:47,271
Yeah,

1410
00:42:47,271 --> 00:42:47,990
just have a,

1411
00:42:47,990 --> 00:42:49,190
the cost 300 bucks at Costco.

1412
00:42:49,191 --> 00:42:50,090
It's not even that hard to do.

1413
00:42:50,100 --> 00:42:50,920
Just by the freezer,

1414
00:42:50,920 --> 00:42:51,920
toss it in the back of the car,

1415
00:42:51,921 --> 00:42:52,461
bring it home,

1416
00:42:52,461 --> 00:42:56,240
throw it in the basement and you've got
meat that costs a third of what it's

1417
00:42:56,241 --> 00:42:57,020
going to cost or,

1418
00:42:57,020 --> 00:42:59,000
or 20% of what it would
cost at whole foods.

1419
00:42:59,300 --> 00:43:00,200
I've got links on my site.

1420
00:43:00,201 --> 00:43:02,690
You can order a hundred pounds at a time
and just have it shipped to your house.

1421
00:43:02,720 --> 00:43:04,100
Jesus Christ.

1422
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:06,320
But doesn't it taste
funky because it's frozen?

1423
00:43:06,770 --> 00:43:07,131
You know,

1424
00:43:07,131 --> 00:43:08,540
this is a funny thing about me.

1425
00:43:09,320 --> 00:43:11,030
When they hang meat to let it age,

1426
00:43:11,360 --> 00:43:14,210
what they're doing is they're letting
basically mold and bacteria in the

1427
00:43:14,211 --> 00:43:15,830
environment like work on the meat.

1428
00:43:16,160 --> 00:43:20,510
Well the links between those molds
and human health are not so good.

1429
00:43:20,540 --> 00:43:21,260
Think about it.

1430
00:43:21,260 --> 00:43:24,260
This is a mold that likes
to eat meat and Joe,

1431
00:43:24,261 --> 00:43:25,400
you and me are made out of meat.

1432
00:43:25,820 --> 00:43:28,910
So the incidence of low
level fungal infections,

1433
00:43:29,060 --> 00:43:30,680
like I don't need dry age meat.

1434
00:43:30,681 --> 00:43:33,410
That's cooked really rare cause they're
still active fungus that likes to eat.

1435
00:43:33,411 --> 00:43:34,400
What I made out of in there,

1436
00:43:34,460 --> 00:43:35,420
I don't think that's good man.

1437
00:43:35,720 --> 00:43:36,710
How do I not know about it?

1438
00:43:36,711 --> 00:43:37,910
So I burned calories.

1439
00:43:37,910 --> 00:43:38,840
Joe Is this meat?

1440
00:43:40,130 --> 00:43:40,581
That's it.

1441
00:43:40,581 --> 00:43:41,414
You just snort,

1442
00:43:41,820 --> 00:43:42,800
snort and mold.

1443
00:43:42,980 --> 00:43:45,170
So it turns out you want
the freshest of anything.

1444
00:43:45,200 --> 00:43:47,240
As soon as you kill it
and you drain the blood,

1445
00:43:47,241 --> 00:43:48,890
throw it in the freezer and
when you're ready to eat it,

1446
00:43:48,891 --> 00:43:49,550
take it out.

1447
00:43:49,550 --> 00:43:51,960
How many hours from the time it's killed,

1448
00:43:52,400 --> 00:43:53,750
butchered and then frozen.

1449
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:54,833
The stuff that I have,

1450
00:43:55,010 --> 00:43:56,810
I actually specially requested it.

1451
00:43:56,811 --> 00:43:57,800
It was about two days.

1452
00:43:57,950 --> 00:43:58,611
Two days.

1453
00:43:58,611 --> 00:43:58,940
Yeah.

1454
00:43:58,940 --> 00:44:00,890
So they just meet laze
around for two days.

1455
00:44:00,920 --> 00:44:01,041
Yeah.

1456
00:44:01,041 --> 00:44:03,710
What they do is they hang it in a climate
controlled environment which lets all

1457
00:44:03,711 --> 00:44:04,544
the blood come out.

1458
00:44:04,580 --> 00:44:06,350
But typical like high end steak,

1459
00:44:06,351 --> 00:44:07,280
21 days,

1460
00:44:07,310 --> 00:44:09,110
sometimes up to like 64 days.

1461
00:44:09,111 --> 00:44:09,800
Dry Age.

1462
00:44:09,800 --> 00:44:10,071
Yeah.

1463
00:44:10,071 --> 00:44:10,551
And then you know,

1464
00:44:10,551 --> 00:44:10,971
drives me,

1465
00:44:10,971 --> 00:44:11,691
tastes amazing.

1466
00:44:11,691 --> 00:44:13,490
I'm not going to say that it's bad,

1467
00:44:13,491 --> 00:44:18,290
but the difference in how dry age meat
makes your brain feel versus fresh meat

1468
00:44:18,291 --> 00:44:21,320
that's been frozen right away
and then defrost it and cooked.

1469
00:44:21,620 --> 00:44:23,900
You will feel like a different
human being when you eat that stuff.

1470
00:44:23,930 --> 00:44:25,970
What is killed during
the freezing process?

1471
00:44:25,971 --> 00:44:27,080
Is there anything that's killed?

1472
00:44:27,170 --> 00:44:28,640
It's not about the killing,

1473
00:44:28,641 --> 00:44:32,010
although it can kill parasites like
they use that in now you freeze a Sushi

1474
00:44:32,010 --> 00:44:34,110
for a while at very low
temperatures to kill parasites.

1475
00:44:34,470 --> 00:44:37,890
What's going on is you're preventing
the formation of these basically

1476
00:44:37,920 --> 00:44:42,120
psychoactive compounds that form in
addition to those nice yummy flavors that

1477
00:44:42,121 --> 00:44:45,780
come from the east and the fungus
sending tendrils into the meat.

1478
00:44:46,050 --> 00:44:46,980
So that nice kind of soft,

1479
00:44:46,990 --> 00:44:47,431
mushy,

1480
00:44:47,431 --> 00:44:48,264
dry age meat.

1481
00:44:48,630 --> 00:44:49,680
Even if it's grass fed,

1482
00:44:49,710 --> 00:44:53,580
it has health impacts including
cardiovascular impacts
that are not present for

1483
00:44:53,581 --> 00:44:54,900
fresh meat that was frozen.

1484
00:44:55,560 --> 00:44:56,430
Wow.

1485
00:44:56,520 --> 00:44:58,230
But yet so delicious.

1486
00:44:58,231 --> 00:45:00,120
Nature's fucked us again man.

1487
00:45:00,210 --> 00:45:01,110
I still eat bacon,

1488
00:45:01,490 --> 00:45:02,080
no problems there.

1489
00:45:02,080 --> 00:45:02,821
Here's the thing,

1490
00:45:02,821 --> 00:45:03,120
why?

1491
00:45:03,120 --> 00:45:06,090
Why does dry cause dry age
does tastes pretty damn good.

1492
00:45:06,210 --> 00:45:08,160
It here's how we discovered dry a dry.

1493
00:45:08,280 --> 00:45:10,140
How long have we really had good freezers,

1494
00:45:10,280 --> 00:45:10,650
right?

1495
00:45:10,650 --> 00:45:11,483
Not that long.

1496
00:45:11,540 --> 00:45:14,190
And so you're going to kill a
giant cow a hundred years ago.

1497
00:45:14,370 --> 00:45:16,640
You're going to hang it in the coolest
place that you can find and you're going

1498
00:45:16,641 --> 00:45:18,930
to whack off pieces of an eat
it like kind of cal on the cop,

1499
00:45:18,931 --> 00:45:19,764
right?

1500
00:45:21,450 --> 00:45:21,781
Yeah,

1501
00:45:21,781 --> 00:45:22,351
I guess so.

1502
00:45:22,351 --> 00:45:24,690
I mean back then there must
have eaten a lot of rotten meat.

1503
00:45:24,691 --> 00:45:26,010
Just yeah,

1504
00:45:26,250 --> 00:45:27,083
keep it going.

1505
00:45:27,300 --> 00:45:29,670
Now did that have anything to do with the,

1506
00:45:29,810 --> 00:45:33,000
the appendix or was the
appendix for processing fiber?

1507
00:45:33,190 --> 00:45:33,980
What was the appendix

1508
00:45:33,980 --> 00:45:34,813
processing?

1509
00:45:34,820 --> 00:45:37,070
I don't think that there's a
scientific consensus there.

1510
00:45:37,071 --> 00:45:37,640
I've heard it.

1511
00:45:37,640 --> 00:45:39,400
It's a store for um,

1512
00:45:39,820 --> 00:45:40,010
uh,

1513
00:45:40,010 --> 00:45:42,710
for probiotics potentially
like the healthy bacteria.

1514
00:45:42,711 --> 00:45:44,600
Like that's like the
little storehouse for them,

1515
00:45:44,930 --> 00:45:47,360
but I've never heard a definitive,

1516
00:45:47,361 --> 00:45:50,090
this is why we had an appendix
that everyone agreed with.

1517
00:45:51,190 --> 00:45:56,080
So humans for a long time had to be able
to deal with a certain amount of fungus

1518
00:45:56,081 --> 00:45:56,914
and bacteria.

1519
00:45:58,210 --> 00:45:58,571
In fact,

1520
00:45:58,571 --> 00:45:59,231
wired magazine.

1521
00:45:59,231 --> 00:45:59,320
Yeah,

1522
00:45:59,320 --> 00:46:00,550
just published this whole thing like,

1523
00:46:00,580 --> 00:46:00,641
oh,

1524
00:46:00,641 --> 00:46:03,760
we've been focusing on the genome of the
bacteria in the gut and we just noticed

1525
00:46:03,761 --> 00:46:06,730
there's just as much fungus growing
in your gut as there is bacteria.

1526
00:46:06,970 --> 00:46:08,050
If we don't know anything about it,

1527
00:46:08,550 --> 00:46:09,490
she's as Christ.

1528
00:46:09,670 --> 00:46:14,500
How weird is it that we have organisms
that are essential to human survival and

1529
00:46:14,501 --> 00:46:16,660
they live inside of our intestinal tract.

1530
00:46:16,760 --> 00:46:17,710
They're essential.

1531
00:46:17,711 --> 00:46:18,491
If you don't have them,

1532
00:46:18,491 --> 00:46:19,300
you will die.

1533
00:46:19,300 --> 00:46:19,961
The question is,

1534
00:46:19,961 --> 00:46:20,920
are they apart from,

1535
00:46:21,340 --> 00:46:22,510
I mean that's a part of being human,

1536
00:46:22,511 --> 00:46:22,691
right?

1537
00:46:22,691 --> 00:46:23,610
If you're dead without them,

1538
00:46:23,660 --> 00:46:25,210
they're just like party
your repair system.

1539
00:46:25,240 --> 00:46:25,451
Yeah,

1540
00:46:25,451 --> 00:46:26,410
there the soldiers.

1541
00:46:26,450 --> 00:46:27,370
So the little soldiers,

1542
00:46:27,400 --> 00:46:27,770
that's what I,

1543
00:46:27,770 --> 00:46:30,130
when I tell people about probiotics,

1544
00:46:30,250 --> 00:46:33,340
I used to get sick a lot when I went on
the road until I really started getting

1545
00:46:33,341 --> 00:46:35,950
into Kombucha is my
favorite because it's easy.

1546
00:46:35,951 --> 00:46:38,320
I liked the way it tastes and I'll
drink a couple of those a day and I'm

1547
00:46:38,321 --> 00:46:39,130
covered.

1548
00:46:39,130 --> 00:46:42,550
And it's made a huge significant
impact on how many calls did I get.

1549
00:46:42,610 --> 00:46:43,960
I mean it's just they stopped,

1550
00:46:44,020 --> 00:46:44,830
they just stopped.

1551
00:46:44,830 --> 00:46:45,400
I love it.

1552
00:46:45,400 --> 00:46:46,680
And the way I explained to people,

1553
00:46:46,700 --> 00:46:46,961
I go,

1554
00:46:46,961 --> 00:46:47,794
it's like hell.

1555
00:46:48,010 --> 00:46:49,330
When you eat healthy bacteria,

1556
00:46:49,331 --> 00:46:50,830
it's like sending soldiers.

1557
00:46:51,040 --> 00:46:52,420
You have healthy soldiers,

1558
00:46:52,570 --> 00:46:55,930
they're going to go out and whack
all the shitty things that you touch.

1559
00:46:55,960 --> 00:46:57,040
Like it really does work that,

1560
00:46:57,070 --> 00:46:57,903
yeah,

1561
00:46:58,070 --> 00:46:59,180
but now think about this.

1562
00:46:59,210 --> 00:47:00,200
If you do that,

1563
00:47:00,230 --> 00:47:02,780
do drink your Kombucha and
then you go have a normal,

1564
00:47:02,850 --> 00:47:05,090
you know rabbi that was
fed industrial meat.

1565
00:47:05,210 --> 00:47:08,090
It's got antibiotics and that means they
use antibiotics cause they make animals

1566
00:47:08,091 --> 00:47:08,451
fatter,

1567
00:47:08,451 --> 00:47:11,990
faster so that it's not that they're
using it to keep him from getting sick,

1568
00:47:12,020 --> 00:47:12,800
they just want the,

1569
00:47:12,800 --> 00:47:14,150
the muscle striations.

1570
00:47:14,151 --> 00:47:16,070
They want the fat to
marble through the muscle.

1571
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:17,390
So now you're eating that.

1572
00:47:17,391 --> 00:47:20,390
You just whacked those nice
bacteria that you put in your gut.

1573
00:47:20,600 --> 00:47:22,790
And that's why I'm kind
of militant when I go out.

1574
00:47:22,820 --> 00:47:25,160
I'll eat fish like non farmed fish,

1575
00:47:25,161 --> 00:47:28,430
wild caught fish long before I'm an
eat steak at a normal steakhouse.

1576
00:47:28,460 --> 00:47:28,851
If they say,

1577
00:47:28,851 --> 00:47:30,010
oh it's fed grass finished

1578
00:47:30,010 --> 00:47:30,281
steak,

1579
00:47:30,281 --> 00:47:31,750
I'm like double load me up.

1580
00:47:31,751 --> 00:47:32,650
I'll have two pounds of it.

1581
00:47:33,130 --> 00:47:34,900
But the rest of the time
when I'm on the road,

1582
00:47:34,901 --> 00:47:35,320
I'm,

1583
00:47:35,320 --> 00:47:35,710
you know,

1584
00:47:35,710 --> 00:47:37,240
you'll see in my backpack I've got,

1585
00:47:37,241 --> 00:47:37,390
you know,

1586
00:47:37,390 --> 00:47:38,500
smoke sockeye salmon.

1587
00:47:38,530 --> 00:47:39,910
That's stuff is as clean as it gets.

1588
00:47:40,390 --> 00:47:42,010
So when you go to a restaurant,

1589
00:47:42,110 --> 00:47:43,900
what were of still your EAD rather,

1590
00:47:43,901 --> 00:47:45,670
but it's hard to even get wild fish,

1591
00:47:45,671 --> 00:47:45,971
man.

1592
00:47:45,971 --> 00:47:50,340
A lot of fishes farmed fish like that
weird salmon where they actually changed

1593
00:47:50,341 --> 00:47:51,174
the color of the,

1594
00:47:51,190 --> 00:47:51,401
the,

1595
00:47:51,401 --> 00:47:52,490
the flash to China.

1596
00:47:53,010 --> 00:47:53,843
That's not right.

1597
00:47:53,940 --> 00:47:55,780
When you hit these prison bitch salmon,

1598
00:47:55,840 --> 00:47:57,460
the ones that you buy in the supermarket,

1599
00:47:57,610 --> 00:47:59,500
they have like this pale flesh.

1600
00:47:59,501 --> 00:48:01,630
It's like they just like
fuck it and it's mushy.

1601
00:48:01,631 --> 00:48:02,464
It's gross.

1602
00:48:02,740 --> 00:48:03,880
They feeding them pallets,

1603
00:48:03,910 --> 00:48:04,450
you know,

1604
00:48:04,450 --> 00:48:08,770
and the pellets are like soy and corn
and antibiotics plus ground up sardines

1605
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:09,340
and it's,

1606
00:48:09,340 --> 00:48:09,590
they're,

1607
00:48:09,590 --> 00:48:10,660
they're environmentally destructive.

1608
00:48:10,660 --> 00:48:14,530
Like you shouldn't buy farmed fish on
principle because it's bad for the world.

1609
00:48:14,531 --> 00:48:16,150
Like our oceans are
already screwed up enough.

1610
00:48:16,151 --> 00:48:16,984
We don't need that.

1611
00:48:17,230 --> 00:48:18,430
It's also like,

1612
00:48:18,580 --> 00:48:19,990
it seems fucked up.

1613
00:48:19,991 --> 00:48:20,411
I mean it's,

1614
00:48:20,411 --> 00:48:20,680
it's,

1615
00:48:20,680 --> 00:48:23,680
it's fucked up enough that
you catch them with nets,

1616
00:48:23,970 --> 00:48:24,191
you know,

1617
00:48:24,191 --> 00:48:28,200
just swoop through an entire environment
and kill everything and rope it up and

1618
00:48:28,210 --> 00:48:29,440
that's fucked up enough.

1619
00:48:29,441 --> 00:48:30,700
But at least those were wild,

1620
00:48:31,350 --> 00:48:32,620
wild until that moment.

1621
00:48:32,621 --> 00:48:33,580
And then they got checked.

1622
00:48:34,120 --> 00:48:36,790
But to just live in
this fucking kitty pawn,

1623
00:48:36,820 --> 00:48:38,980
while they throw this
bullshit and on top of you,

1624
00:48:38,981 --> 00:48:41,920
that's all you have to eat
just seems fucking stupid.

1625
00:48:42,130 --> 00:48:46,210
I think w there's certain things that
people do to animals that are really

1626
00:48:46,211 --> 00:48:48,340
arrogant and zoos are one of them.

1627
00:48:48,380 --> 00:48:48,780
Ah,

1628
00:48:48,780 --> 00:48:51,910
and I just kind of break my heart
even though the real natural ones.

1629
00:48:51,911 --> 00:48:56,140
But I've been to zoos like in Cambodia
and all and like you see the stress

1630
00:48:56,141 --> 00:48:56,921
behavior in animals,

1631
00:48:56,921 --> 00:48:57,140
it's,

1632
00:48:57,140 --> 00:48:57,970
it's just horrible.

1633
00:48:57,970 --> 00:48:59,070
It shouldn't be allowed.

1634
00:48:59,100 --> 00:48:59,880
It I,

1635
00:48:59,880 --> 00:49:04,150
I'm a hypocrite because I go cause I want
my kids to see what animals look like

1636
00:49:04,151 --> 00:49:04,990
cause it's interesting.

1637
00:49:05,290 --> 00:49:07,300
But if I had my choice,

1638
00:49:07,301 --> 00:49:09,950
I would say don't let this
bring you back to the woods,

1639
00:49:09,951 --> 00:49:10,241
man.

1640
00:49:10,241 --> 00:49:11,860
Let them live in the jungle at the liver.

1641
00:49:11,861 --> 00:49:12,251
They live.

1642
00:49:12,251 --> 00:49:13,180
This is nonsense.

1643
00:49:13,420 --> 00:49:17,950
Like you either you either want to get
rid of them because they're dangerous or

1644
00:49:17,980 --> 00:49:18,730
you know,

1645
00:49:18,730 --> 00:49:19,960
leave them the fuck alone.

1646
00:49:20,170 --> 00:49:20,810
Those are those,

1647
00:49:20,810 --> 00:49:21,640
the two options,

1648
00:49:21,640 --> 00:49:24,880
the idea that you can take them and just
lock them in this little environment so

1649
00:49:24,881 --> 00:49:27,280
people can stare at them
as they paste in circles.

1650
00:49:27,460 --> 00:49:28,420
That's torture.

1651
00:49:28,630 --> 00:49:29,650
That's craziness.

1652
00:49:29,710 --> 00:49:31,600
And even let them kill
anything and you know,

1653
00:49:31,601 --> 00:49:32,170
it's bad.

1654
00:49:32,170 --> 00:49:33,430
Look what they feed those animals.

1655
00:49:33,431 --> 00:49:34,840
They all die like in a third.

1656
00:49:34,841 --> 00:49:37,450
The amount of time they live in the wild
and it's not just stress from being in

1657
00:49:37,451 --> 00:49:39,760
captivity and you're having people
throw cigarette butts at you.

1658
00:49:40,270 --> 00:49:43,900
It's because they feed them crap and
they're sort of figuring that out.

1659
00:49:43,930 --> 00:49:44,470
Oh look,

1660
00:49:44,470 --> 00:49:48,070
they keep dying and we keep having
surgery and doing all this weird stuff to

1661
00:49:48,071 --> 00:49:48,671
keep them alive.

1662
00:49:48,671 --> 00:49:50,020
Kind of like they do for people now.

1663
00:49:50,650 --> 00:49:51,910
They're giving them prison food,

1664
00:49:52,390 --> 00:49:53,670
poor fucking gorillas.

1665
00:49:53,980 --> 00:49:54,813
So sad.

1666
00:49:54,940 --> 00:49:57,160
[inaudible] watched him
pace around that thing.

1667
00:49:57,161 --> 00:49:57,461
I was like,

1668
00:49:57,461 --> 00:49:58,060
wow,

1669
00:49:58,060 --> 00:49:58,420
you know,

1670
00:49:58,420 --> 00:49:59,830
my two year old thinks it's awesome,

1671
00:49:59,860 --> 00:50:00,580
but you know,

1672
00:50:00,580 --> 00:50:01,351
to me it's,

1673
00:50:01,351 --> 00:50:01,551
it's,

1674
00:50:01,551 --> 00:50:03,370
it's kind of trippy eagles,

1675
00:50:03,371 --> 00:50:04,690
the eagles in this net,

1676
00:50:04,930 --> 00:50:05,890
the eagles couldn't fly.

1677
00:50:05,891 --> 00:50:06,431
It was crazy.

1678
00:50:06,431 --> 00:50:09,820
They get an Roi like a little bit and
then land and fly a little bit and you're

1679
00:50:09,821 --> 00:50:09,941
like,

1680
00:50:09,941 --> 00:50:10,421
oh my God,

1681
00:50:10,421 --> 00:50:11,410
they must be going nuts.

1682
00:50:11,610 --> 00:50:14,620
They fucking bald eagles
and they can't just sore.

1683
00:50:14,621 --> 00:50:18,550
Like they get sore man and float around
and they want to like kill rabbits and

1684
00:50:18,551 --> 00:50:19,310
things like that.

1685
00:50:19,310 --> 00:50:22,330
I'm pretty sure they're not getting much
of that going on even though pellets,

1686
00:50:22,750 --> 00:50:24,040
they're giving them dog shit.

1687
00:50:24,040 --> 00:50:24,873
And a can,

1688
00:50:25,180 --> 00:50:25,600
you know,

1689
00:50:25,600 --> 00:50:26,050
it's like,

1690
00:50:26,050 --> 00:50:26,950
it's terrible.

1691
00:50:27,200 --> 00:50:28,130
What are they feeding them?

1692
00:50:28,131 --> 00:50:30,620
They push out a little tray
of meat and the Eagle eats.

1693
00:50:30,621 --> 00:50:31,670
It's ridiculous.

1694
00:50:32,060 --> 00:50:37,060
We were that we would take away the one
thing that nature must have them set up

1695
00:50:38,271 --> 00:50:42,310
for a massive reward of
endorphins and of of,

1696
00:50:42,320 --> 00:50:42,621
you know,

1697
00:50:42,621 --> 00:50:42,920
Sarah,

1698
00:50:42,920 --> 00:50:45,050
whatever the fuck their little
brains produce a little lizard.

1699
00:50:45,110 --> 00:50:45,970
Excellent questions.

1700
00:50:46,640 --> 00:50:47,421
Evil Eyes.

1701
00:50:47,421 --> 00:50:48,770
You have a look in the eyes of an eagle.

1702
00:50:48,771 --> 00:50:50,360
What a creepy fucking eyeball.

1703
00:50:50,390 --> 00:50:50,871
Those things.

1704
00:50:50,871 --> 00:50:53,450
That Eagle is just representing
our country very well.

1705
00:50:53,500 --> 00:50:54,333
Joe,

1706
00:50:54,560 --> 00:50:54,970
look,

1707
00:50:54,970 --> 00:50:56,660
Eagle fly.

1708
00:50:56,810 --> 00:51:01,670
If you ever heard that video where I'm
that crazy dude that used John Ashcroft.

1709
00:51:01,720 --> 00:51:02,553
Remember John Ashbery?

1710
00:51:02,820 --> 00:51:03,440
Super Crazy.

1711
00:51:03,440 --> 00:51:04,730
Super Crazy,

1712
00:51:04,880 --> 00:51:07,070
but he has a song I remember.

1713
00:51:07,080 --> 00:51:08,430
Did we play on the podcast ones?

1714
00:51:08,490 --> 00:51:09,320
Yeah,

1715
00:51:09,320 --> 00:51:10,220
we won't play it again.

1716
00:51:10,250 --> 00:51:10,940
Just look up.

1717
00:51:10,940 --> 00:51:12,080
John Ashcroft.

1718
00:51:12,081 --> 00:51:13,760
Let the Eagle Soar.

1719
00:51:14,060 --> 00:51:15,680
Oh my God.

1720
00:51:15,710 --> 00:51:17,300
Or let the eagle fly.

1721
00:51:17,300 --> 00:51:19,340
What does it add?

1722
00:51:19,380 --> 00:51:21,060
Dubstep at the end of
it's probably better.

1723
00:51:21,110 --> 00:51:21,430
It's,

1724
00:51:21,430 --> 00:51:22,263
it's,

1725
00:51:22,670 --> 00:51:24,050
it's amazingly crazy.

1726
00:51:24,051 --> 00:51:25,670
Have you seen it a long time ago?

1727
00:51:25,671 --> 00:51:26,504
Yeah.

1728
00:51:26,510 --> 00:51:29,210
It's amazingly crazy if
she wants that sky diver.

1729
00:51:29,240 --> 00:51:29,750
Yes.

1730
00:51:29,750 --> 00:51:30,680
That was amazing.

1731
00:51:30,681 --> 00:51:31,341
Did you see that?

1732
00:51:31,341 --> 00:51:31,910
That's awesome.

1733
00:51:31,910 --> 00:51:35,330
I was hoping that a Ufo was going to
snatch him out of the sky on his way down.

1734
00:51:35,900 --> 00:51:36,710
That was an awesome,

1735
00:51:36,710 --> 00:51:38,840
that faint because doesn't
that something like,

1736
00:51:38,841 --> 00:51:39,021
you know,

1737
00:51:39,021 --> 00:51:40,590
like scaring a bunny rabbit that,

1738
00:51:40,591 --> 00:51:43,340
that just your body can't
take falling from space.

1739
00:51:43,341 --> 00:51:44,090
You almost did.

1740
00:51:44,090 --> 00:51:47,630
He said he was spinning and he said that
if he spent spun anymore he could pass

1741
00:51:47,631 --> 00:51:48,410
out and die.

1742
00:51:48,410 --> 00:51:49,101
And so he was like,

1743
00:51:49,101 --> 00:51:52,160
do I pull the rip cord and slow down
and I hit the record and he said,

1744
00:51:52,161 --> 00:51:53,030
I'm just going to do it anyway.

1745
00:51:53,450 --> 00:51:54,283
He didn't pass out.

1746
00:51:54,320 --> 00:51:55,070
Wow.

1747
00:51:55,070 --> 00:51:55,280
Yeah.

1748
00:51:55,280 --> 00:51:58,190
He was flipping and then he
leveled out somehow or another.

1749
00:51:58,191 --> 00:52:00,560
I don't know how he leveled
out the flying squirrel thing.

1750
00:52:00,561 --> 00:52:01,820
Just oh yeah,

1751
00:52:01,821 --> 00:52:02,570
he uh,

1752
00:52:02,570 --> 00:52:04,790
it was really weird to watch
them step off of it though.

1753
00:52:04,791 --> 00:52:08,240
That was really weird to be right behind
them with the camera and watch them

1754
00:52:08,241 --> 00:52:09,260
just drop on a site.

1755
00:52:09,440 --> 00:52:10,460
That's pretty epic.

1756
00:52:10,880 --> 00:52:12,140
That dude was in a balloon.

1757
00:52:12,440 --> 00:52:13,530
I didn't know you could take a balloon.

1758
00:52:13,531 --> 00:52:14,720
The space that's your daycare.

1759
00:52:14,790 --> 00:52:18,650
Just know that know who'd
want to take a balloon,

1760
00:52:18,651 --> 00:52:19,484
the space,

1761
00:52:19,820 --> 00:52:21,170
why haven't we done this already?

1762
00:52:21,290 --> 00:52:23,510
Why aren't their trips to
go to space in a balloon?

1763
00:52:23,540 --> 00:52:25,160
Hi Richard Branson should
check this guy out.

1764
00:52:25,220 --> 00:52:26,053
What's up rich?

1765
00:52:26,220 --> 00:52:27,430
And if you're right,

1766
00:52:27,470 --> 00:52:28,370
here's another question.

1767
00:52:28,820 --> 00:52:32,930
Is it possible you're hit by a satellite
cause don't satellites whip around the

1768
00:52:32,931 --> 00:52:33,261
earth?

1769
00:52:33,261 --> 00:52:33,531
Sure.

1770
00:52:33,531 --> 00:52:36,140
It wouldn't be going like 500
miles an hour or something to get,

1771
00:52:36,170 --> 00:52:38,780
they're usually probably
like not like states off,

1772
00:52:38,810 --> 00:52:40,490
you know like millions of miles off.

1773
00:52:40,500 --> 00:52:42,710
Like that almost hit me like
I'm smelling satellites.

1774
00:52:42,711 --> 00:52:43,700
It's the space junk.

1775
00:52:43,701 --> 00:52:45,000
So we didn't talk about this but like I,

1776
00:52:45,010 --> 00:52:45,591
I'm a geek.

1777
00:52:45,591 --> 00:52:46,070
Like I,

1778
00:52:46,070 --> 00:52:48,680
I'm a vice president at a computer
and that security company,

1779
00:52:48,710 --> 00:52:50,960
like Silicon Valley Guy and yeah,

1780
00:52:50,961 --> 00:52:52,250
we have like problems with space junk,

1781
00:52:52,280 --> 00:52:55,100
serious problems where they map it all
out and there's like storms were like

1782
00:52:55,101 --> 00:52:58,850
little nuts from like a Chinese
rocket from 40 years ago or whatever.

1783
00:52:58,851 --> 00:53:00,530
It was spinning around
probably not 40 years.

1784
00:53:00,920 --> 00:53:01,760
And they're like bullets.

1785
00:53:01,761 --> 00:53:02,051
I mean there's,

1786
00:53:02,051 --> 00:53:04,760
there hypersonic and they
poke holes in satellites.

1787
00:53:04,820 --> 00:53:06,620
They can kill people on space station,

1788
00:53:06,621 --> 00:53:07,431
so it's getting to be like,

1789
00:53:07,431 --> 00:53:08,400
my God,

1790
00:53:08,480 --> 00:53:09,530
it's kind of dangerous up there.

1791
00:53:09,590 --> 00:53:10,640
Jesus Christ.

1792
00:53:10,641 --> 00:53:12,690
Could you imagine sitting in
the fucking space day shooting?

1793
00:53:12,691 --> 00:53:14,060
You hear like bolts?

1794
00:53:14,061 --> 00:53:14,211
Yeah,

1795
00:53:14,211 --> 00:53:15,320
you're digging and you're like,

1796
00:53:15,321 --> 00:53:19,570
that's the whole cash is a hole right
to the other side and you look down,

1797
00:53:19,600 --> 00:53:20,450
your leg is bleeding.

1798
00:53:20,870 --> 00:53:22,910
They track all that stuff now
so they know if it's coming.

1799
00:53:22,940 --> 00:53:23,780
Oh my God,

1800
00:53:23,781 --> 00:53:26,520
they tracked the bolts
that are flying in space

1801
00:53:26,620 --> 00:53:27,780
because of how many of them are there?

1802
00:53:27,870 --> 00:53:29,340
Like hundreds of thousands now.

1803
00:53:29,370 --> 00:53:30,950
Oh my God.

1804
00:53:31,210 --> 00:53:32,450
Do you have like whole like you know,

1805
00:53:32,540 --> 00:53:34,920
leftover fueled capsules
and all this stuff?

1806
00:53:34,940 --> 00:53:36,330
I astronauts poop that.

1807
00:53:36,331 --> 00:53:37,164
They do.

1808
00:53:38,120 --> 00:53:39,140
I'm serious.

1809
00:53:39,150 --> 00:53:39,780
Like frozen.

1810
00:53:39,780 --> 00:53:41,730
You know things they'd like to buy it.

1811
00:53:41,731 --> 00:53:43,470
Frozen Turd and when
you're out on a space walk,

1812
00:53:43,471 --> 00:53:44,304
if it can happen.

1813
00:53:44,700 --> 00:53:48,630
I've had semi frozen Turd
Beam Debbie and it still hurt.

1814
00:53:50,400 --> 00:53:51,420
I can't believe that.

1815
00:53:51,421 --> 00:53:54,030
I can't believe there's hundreds of
thousands of pieces of junk up there.

1816
00:53:54,930 --> 00:53:55,920
That's insane.

1817
00:53:56,700 --> 00:53:56,941
Yeah.

1818
00:53:56,941 --> 00:53:58,050
No one's going to clean that either.

1819
00:53:58,051 --> 00:54:01,950
It's not like you can put a net up there
and scoop it all up because for most of

1820
00:54:01,951 --> 00:54:04,230
it came from military exercises.

1821
00:54:05,130 --> 00:54:07,890
Let's blow up a satellite in
orbit and see what happens.

1822
00:54:07,891 --> 00:54:08,070
Like,

1823
00:54:08,070 --> 00:54:08,311
oh,

1824
00:54:08,311 --> 00:54:09,840
it scatters crap all over orbit.

1825
00:54:09,841 --> 00:54:10,021
Yeah,

1826
00:54:10,021 --> 00:54:11,490
it's just an environmental problem.

1827
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:13,770
Just like we have in our oceans
are somewhere else in the middle.

1828
00:54:13,840 --> 00:54:14,010
Sir.

1829
00:54:14,010 --> 00:54:19,010
So crazy that in the 60s when they first
started like thinking about going to

1830
00:54:20,211 --> 00:54:21,044
the moon,

1831
00:54:21,210 --> 00:54:22,610
they did the thing called

1832
00:54:22,820 --> 00:54:24,380
[inaudible] starfish prime,

1833
00:54:24,620 --> 00:54:29,620
where they shot a nuclear bomb up
into the atmosphere and blew it up.

1834
00:54:29,750 --> 00:54:31,760
They blew it up in the radiation belts.

1835
00:54:31,790 --> 00:54:33,860
Just let's see what happened
and what will happen though.

1836
00:54:34,830 --> 00:54:36,200
It's fucking crazy.

1837
00:54:36,440 --> 00:54:37,280
Nobody knows.

1838
00:54:37,310 --> 00:54:37,731
There's no money.

1839
00:54:37,731 --> 00:54:38,151
They had to go,

1840
00:54:38,151 --> 00:54:38,311
hey,

1841
00:54:38,311 --> 00:54:38,511
hey,

1842
00:54:38,511 --> 00:54:38,840
hey,

1843
00:54:38,840 --> 00:54:39,673
what are you doing?

1844
00:54:39,770 --> 00:54:42,260
Don't just fucking do
it to see what happens.

1845
00:54:42,280 --> 00:54:43,340
You guys crazy.

1846
00:54:43,670 --> 00:54:46,310
What's the benefit of shooting
a nuclear bomb in this space?

1847
00:54:46,490 --> 00:54:48,530
You crazy fucks theirs.

1848
00:54:48,620 --> 00:54:49,940
They've gotten nuts on that stuff.

1849
00:54:50,180 --> 00:54:50,780
It's interesting.

1850
00:54:50,780 --> 00:54:54,890
My grandparents met on the Manhattan
project like in Chicago before Los

1851
00:54:54,890 --> 00:54:54,891
Homeless.

1852
00:54:54,891 --> 00:54:58,640
My grandmother's a master's degree in
nuclear engineering in one like a lifetime

1853
00:54:58,641 --> 00:55:00,380
achievement reward for
nuclear engineering,

1854
00:55:00,381 --> 00:55:01,370
like one of two women ever.

1855
00:55:01,520 --> 00:55:03,260
So like I grew up in a
nuclear family like this,

1856
00:55:03,261 --> 00:55:05,720
but even there like could we stop
blowing those things up everywhere?

1857
00:55:05,721 --> 00:55:07,340
Like they're kind of useful in a war,

1858
00:55:07,341 --> 00:55:10,250
but like maybe blowing up a few hundred
of them around the planet isn't a good

1859
00:55:10,251 --> 00:55:10,910
idea.

1860
00:55:10,910 --> 00:55:11,091
Well,

1861
00:55:11,091 --> 00:55:12,140
have you ever seen the A,

1862
00:55:12,141 --> 00:55:17,141
there's an animated Gif file or maybe
it's a video that shows all of the,

1863
00:55:18,350 --> 00:55:22,430
on the globe shows you a map of the
world and it shows all of the nuclear

1864
00:55:22,431 --> 00:55:25,940
explosions in their correct
order that have taken place,

1865
00:55:25,941 --> 00:55:27,560
all the tests and it's like

1866
00:55:27,660 --> 00:55:28,493
boom,

1867
00:55:29,300 --> 00:55:30,133
boom,

1868
00:55:30,510 --> 00:55:30,810
boom,

1869
00:55:30,810 --> 00:55:31,081
boom,

1870
00:55:31,081 --> 00:55:31,830
boom,

1871
00:55:31,830 --> 00:55:32,400
boom,

1872
00:55:32,400 --> 00:55:32,611
boom,

1873
00:55:32,611 --> 00:55:32,821
boom,

1874
00:55:32,821 --> 00:55:33,270
boom,

1875
00:55:33,270 --> 00:55:33,690
boom.

1876
00:55:33,690 --> 00:55:35,030
And the Soviet Union ones pump,

1877
00:55:35,031 --> 00:55:35,291
pump,

1878
00:55:35,291 --> 00:55:35,700
pump.

1879
00:55:35,700 --> 00:55:36,330
Wow.

1880
00:55:36,330 --> 00:55:37,270
Want to be awesome.

1881
00:55:37,610 --> 00:55:38,443
You should link to that

1882
00:55:40,950 --> 00:55:41,720
video

1883
00:55:41,720 --> 00:55:43,720
of all of the nuclear explosion.

1884
00:55:43,721 --> 00:55:44,770
It's just to try,

1885
00:55:44,820 --> 00:55:45,040
you'll,

1886
00:55:45,040 --> 00:55:45,850
you'll find it.

1887
00:55:45,850 --> 00:55:46,250
Um,

1888
00:55:46,250 --> 00:55:46,821
but I've seen it,

1889
00:55:46,821 --> 00:55:47,440
it's fast.

1890
00:55:47,440 --> 00:55:48,800
There's been like more than a hundred.

1891
00:55:48,860 --> 00:55:49,370
Yeah.

1892
00:55:49,370 --> 00:55:49,700
Yeah.

1893
00:55:49,700 --> 00:55:50,840
A hundred nuclear explosions.

1894
00:55:50,841 --> 00:55:51,680
I did not know that.

1895
00:55:51,810 --> 00:55:52,760
It's really scary.

1896
00:55:52,761 --> 00:55:54,440
And some of the things that happen there.

1897
00:55:54,710 --> 00:55:57,810
We have a kind of a rise
in thyroid cancer and gee,

1898
00:55:57,830 --> 00:56:01,580
you get radioactive iodine out there and
have these having environmental impact.

1899
00:56:01,790 --> 00:56:06,180
And some of the stuff we
don't even understand like
low frequency vibrations on

1900
00:56:06,181 --> 00:56:07,490
the Earth's crust from those things.

1901
00:56:08,300 --> 00:56:12,820
There's biological effects from the
reverberation of the Earth's crust here to

1902
00:56:12,840 --> 00:56:13,910
the Schuman residence.

1903
00:56:14,270 --> 00:56:14,930
Um,

1904
00:56:14,930 --> 00:56:16,370
when funders strikes,

1905
00:56:16,371 --> 00:56:19,670
you get this reflection between the eye
on the sphere and the earth's crust and

1906
00:56:19,671 --> 00:56:20,504
it creates a,

1907
00:56:20,570 --> 00:56:20,930
uh,

1908
00:56:20,930 --> 00:56:21,501
basically a,

1909
00:56:21,501 --> 00:56:22,520
a brown to 10 hearts.

1910
00:56:22,521 --> 00:56:25,150
I forget the nine point
something hertz frequency.

1911
00:56:25,510 --> 00:56:27,070
And if we don't have this,

1912
00:56:27,071 --> 00:56:29,050
like we don't work very well as humans.

1913
00:56:29,320 --> 00:56:29,981
And in fact,

1914
00:56:29,981 --> 00:56:31,360
in the Russian space program,

1915
00:56:31,361 --> 00:56:33,400
they actually figured out that
they were not doing well at all.

1916
00:56:33,400 --> 00:56:36,040
They actually replicate
this inside the spacecraft.

1917
00:56:36,041 --> 00:56:38,050
Now make a rumble or go sound,

1918
00:56:38,080 --> 00:56:38,741
you don't hear it.

1919
00:56:38,741 --> 00:56:40,150
It's like an electrical thing.

1920
00:56:40,151 --> 00:56:42,190
It's a super low frequency EMF.

1921
00:56:42,460 --> 00:56:43,293
So this,

1922
00:56:43,450 --> 00:56:47,650
this EMF that's given out by thunder and
lightening is actually actually has a

1923
00:56:47,651 --> 00:56:49,630
positive effect on human beings.

1924
00:56:49,870 --> 00:56:50,890
It's like a timing signal.

1925
00:56:50,891 --> 00:56:51,551
If we don't get it,

1926
00:56:51,551 --> 00:56:52,241
we don't do so well.

1927
00:56:52,241 --> 00:56:54,490
It's right in the Alpha
brainwave spectrum.

1928
00:56:54,610 --> 00:56:55,443
Oh yeah.

1929
00:56:55,600 --> 00:56:55,931
In fact,

1930
00:56:55,931 --> 00:56:57,210
I have a human way of residence,

1931
00:56:57,260 --> 00:56:57,760
uh,

1932
00:56:57,760 --> 00:56:58,900
creation thing in my,

1933
00:56:58,901 --> 00:56:59,680
in my house.

1934
00:56:59,680 --> 00:57:01,450
Like it's one of things that
lowers biological stress.

1935
00:57:01,600 --> 00:57:04,720
When you have a Schumann resonance
that you're low level biological,

1936
00:57:04,721 --> 00:57:06,530
like electrical systems can sync to,

1937
00:57:07,300 --> 00:57:08,230
it lowers the stress.

1938
00:57:08,231 --> 00:57:10,600
If you have like Wifi routers and
things like that all over the place,

1939
00:57:10,870 --> 00:57:13,870
your body tries to like find a signal
and it doesn't get one very well.

1940
00:57:14,110 --> 00:57:15,250
And when it doesn't get one very well,

1941
00:57:15,280 --> 00:57:17,080
it just raises your cortisol levels.

1942
00:57:17,400 --> 00:57:19,000
Your body is trying to find a signal.

1943
00:57:19,030 --> 00:57:19,870
What do you mean by that?

1944
00:57:20,080 --> 00:57:25,080
So there's an electromagnetic signal on
the earth and it sounds kind of goofy to

1945
00:57:25,631 --> 00:57:26,051
be honest,

1946
00:57:26,051 --> 00:57:29,260
but one of the ways you can do
this is with an earthing mat.

1947
00:57:29,560 --> 00:57:33,280
And I kind of went out on a limb and I
started promoting these as like this,

1948
00:57:33,550 --> 00:57:34,690
this thing rocks.

1949
00:57:35,020 --> 00:57:35,641
And what this is,

1950
00:57:35,641 --> 00:57:35,711
is,

1951
00:57:35,711 --> 00:57:36,544
is a mat.

1952
00:57:36,850 --> 00:57:39,340
It's made out of electrically
conductive fibers.

1953
00:57:39,520 --> 00:57:43,480
It's just silver woven into a sheet and
you plug it into the round part of the

1954
00:57:43,481 --> 00:57:44,890
electrical outlet at your house.

1955
00:57:44,891 --> 00:57:46,090
So just the grounding part.

1956
00:57:46,110 --> 00:57:47,110
Are you sticking into the earth,

1957
00:57:47,111 --> 00:57:49,480
like drop it out the window on a
wire and stick it into the ground?

1958
00:57:50,080 --> 00:57:53,230
You do this and it normalizes your
quarters logs Grecian at night,

1959
00:57:53,260 --> 00:57:55,150
your sleep improves really dramatically.

1960
00:57:55,610 --> 00:57:56,890
Especially for jet lag.

1961
00:57:57,280 --> 00:58:02,110
I absolutely will not travel without my
earthing mat because I don't get jet lag

1962
00:58:02,111 --> 00:58:02,651
at all anymore.

1963
00:58:02,651 --> 00:58:06,130
Like it's just a nonissue what craziness.

1964
00:58:06,131 --> 00:58:09,520
Lance Armstrong uses this on the Tour
de France in order to recover faster,

1965
00:58:09,521 --> 00:58:12,610
like you recover from injuries faster
when you're grounded and there's an

1966
00:58:12,611 --> 00:58:13,241
electrical thing,

1967
00:58:13,241 --> 00:58:14,320
you can measure this happening there.

1968
00:58:14,321 --> 00:58:15,160
There's two effects.

1969
00:58:15,610 --> 00:58:19,930
One is you build up a charge on your
body and you can just pick this up with a

1970
00:58:19,930 --> 00:58:20,180
meter.

1971
00:58:20,180 --> 00:58:23,890
You were walking around indoors or wearing
shoes like rubber shoes all the time.

1972
00:58:24,280 --> 00:58:28,390
So we basically just the error over
our skin builds up a static charge.

1973
00:58:28,391 --> 00:58:29,640
When you get a spark,

1974
00:58:29,660 --> 00:58:29,900
you know,

1975
00:58:29,900 --> 00:58:30,611
like in the desert,

1976
00:58:30,611 --> 00:58:32,380
you know you touched the
most static electricity.

1977
00:58:32,650 --> 00:58:34,330
That's an extreme example of it,

1978
00:58:34,690 --> 00:58:37,450
but our bodies kind of
work like big batteries,

1979
00:58:37,451 --> 00:58:40,480
like we have different electrical fields
in different electrical potentials

1980
00:58:40,481 --> 00:58:41,314
inside the body.

1981
00:58:41,590 --> 00:58:46,330
So when you spend about 20 minutes
walking in grass barefoot or laying on

1982
00:58:46,331 --> 00:58:47,890
earthing mats being on the beach,

1983
00:58:48,280 --> 00:58:51,280
what you're doing is you're dropping the
extra charge that's built up over time.

1984
00:58:51,281 --> 00:58:52,114
And when you do that,

1985
00:58:52,330 --> 00:58:53,230
you heal faster.

1986
00:58:53,260 --> 00:58:54,850
You really do recover faster.

1987
00:58:54,851 --> 00:58:55,020
It,

1988
00:58:55,020 --> 00:58:57,640
it's profoundly amazing how well it works.

1989
00:58:58,410 --> 00:58:58,930
Um,

1990
00:58:58,930 --> 00:59:00,580
there's cardiologist's recommending this,

1991
00:59:00,730 --> 00:59:02,260
there's a whole book written about this.

1992
00:59:02,350 --> 00:59:02,641
I'm like,

1993
00:59:02,641 --> 00:59:05,920
I've heard about people lying in
the grass sleeping in the grass.

1994
00:59:05,950 --> 00:59:07,720
That's why to help them heal.

1995
00:59:07,810 --> 00:59:09,340
I thought this was such bs,

1996
00:59:09,341 --> 00:59:11,110
but like I used to fly to Cambridge,

1997
00:59:11,111 --> 00:59:12,220
England every six weeks.

1998
00:59:12,221 --> 00:59:15,640
I was a vice president of the company
based out there and I'd fly from,

1999
00:59:15,670 --> 00:59:17,320
from the bay area out there.

2000
00:59:17,560 --> 00:59:19,900
And that's like the worst commute
ever in terms of time zones,

2001
00:59:19,901 --> 00:59:20,920
like you're flying east.

2002
00:59:21,470 --> 00:59:23,990
And I would go and I'd start
in the morning when I land,

2003
00:59:23,991 --> 00:59:26,510
I'm going to exercise to raise my body
temperature and that's going to be how I

2004
00:59:26,600 --> 00:59:27,320
hacked my jet,

2005
00:59:27,320 --> 00:59:28,310
my jet lag.

2006
00:59:28,970 --> 00:59:33,470
And one day I did yoga in the park because
like the only day of the year it was

2007
00:59:33,471 --> 00:59:35,180
not rainy in England.

2008
00:59:35,600 --> 00:59:36,200
And uh,

2009
00:59:36,200 --> 00:59:37,340
that's how I had no jet lag.

2010
00:59:37,341 --> 00:59:37,521
I'm like,

2011
00:59:37,521 --> 00:59:37,731
yes,

2012
00:59:37,731 --> 00:59:38,481
my exercise works.

2013
00:59:38,481 --> 00:59:39,610
Then the next time I do it in hotel rooms,

2014
00:59:39,611 --> 00:59:42,210
the same exact thing and
had horrible jet lag.

2015
00:59:42,280 --> 00:59:42,650
I'm like,

2016
00:59:42,650 --> 00:59:43,520
what is it?

2017
00:59:43,700 --> 00:59:44,710
And I finally like,

2018
00:59:44,830 --> 00:59:46,520
like understood years later what,

2019
00:59:46,521 --> 00:59:49,160
what had really been the variable
that I didn't know to look for.

2020
00:59:49,550 --> 00:59:50,870
So this is one of the things,

2021
00:59:50,871 --> 00:59:54,230
it's like a $70 little item and you
try it and you just know it works.

2022
00:59:55,220 --> 00:59:59,660
I wish marijuana was legal to grow cause
I went to a grow room once in this dude

2023
01:00:00,030 --> 01:00:00,741
had this,

2024
01:00:00,741 --> 01:00:01,310
uh,

2025
01:00:01,310 --> 01:00:01,971
he was illegal.

2026
01:00:01,971 --> 01:00:02,820
It was illegal set up.

2027
01:00:03,120 --> 01:00:08,120
I go into the back room and he's got
this room larger than this room and it's

2028
01:00:08,121 --> 01:00:12,560
filled with these really
happy cannabis plants.

2029
01:00:13,070 --> 01:00:16,820
And they have there have been taken care
of with the perfect fertilizer and the

2030
01:00:16,821 --> 01:00:18,740
perfect soil composition.

2031
01:00:18,770 --> 01:00:22,610
There's misters or going off constantly
and there were really healthy and

2032
01:00:22,611 --> 01:00:27,230
vibrant and you walk into that room and
you feel them and it sounds like hippie

2033
01:00:27,231 --> 01:00:28,040
bullshit,

2034
01:00:28,040 --> 01:00:29,330
but I wasn't even high.

2035
01:00:29,480 --> 01:00:31,880
I walked in that room stone
cold sober and I was like,

2036
01:00:31,881 --> 01:00:32,714
Whoa,

2037
01:00:33,370 --> 01:00:33,680
this,

2038
01:00:33,680 --> 01:00:33,951
this,

2039
01:00:33,951 --> 01:00:34,640
this is like,

2040
01:00:34,640 --> 01:00:35,870
like they have a frequency.

2041
01:00:35,871 --> 01:00:38,930
Like there's like it's an
intangible thing that I sense,

2042
01:00:38,931 --> 01:00:41,900
I can feel it but I wouldn't know
how to describe what it's doing.

2043
01:00:42,150 --> 01:00:45,480
I do a lot of work at that level
with the biohacking I talk about.

2044
01:00:45,930 --> 01:00:50,160
So you have this reptilian brain that's
responsible for low level systems in the

2045
01:00:50,161 --> 01:00:50,491
body.

2046
01:00:50,491 --> 01:00:53,640
It's the same thing as salamander
has and it census stuff,

2047
01:00:53,700 --> 01:00:56,910
but it does it so fast that you
don't even know what happened.

2048
01:00:57,270 --> 01:00:59,400
Like if you put your hand on a hot stove,

2049
01:00:59,640 --> 01:01:01,770
you'll pull your hand away before
you know the stove was hot.

2050
01:01:01,970 --> 01:01:03,960
And that's an example
of this thing in action.

2051
01:01:04,170 --> 01:01:07,530
So what it does is it picks up all
kinds of stuff from the environment.

2052
01:01:07,590 --> 01:01:09,210
A lot of stuff we don't
even understand yet,

2053
01:01:09,510 --> 01:01:13,290
but it does it and it matches patterns
so fast that you might just get like a

2054
01:01:13,291 --> 01:01:14,640
wisp of an intuition from it.

2055
01:01:14,820 --> 01:01:16,500
But what's going on there is like the,

2056
01:01:16,680 --> 01:01:21,360
the animal part of you is totally picking
up all these things and you can train

2057
01:01:21,361 --> 01:01:21,970
yourself to,

2058
01:01:21,970 --> 01:01:24,570
to basically be more sensitive to what it,

2059
01:01:24,600 --> 01:01:27,990
what it's telling you and you can train
yourself and train it to behave better

2060
01:01:28,110 --> 01:01:30,570
because that reptilian brain is
what gets us in a lot of trouble.

2061
01:01:30,690 --> 01:01:33,380
It's all how you know when
someone's upset at you,

2062
01:01:33,990 --> 01:01:34,890
when someone's upset at you,

2063
01:01:34,891 --> 01:01:36,450
even if they're trying to
pretend that they're not,

2064
01:01:36,451 --> 01:01:36,811
you know,

2065
01:01:36,811 --> 01:01:39,480
there's somethings off that
giving you a certain feel.

2066
01:01:39,780 --> 01:01:42,270
Now I'm going to sound
like a total hippie Wacko.

2067
01:01:42,271 --> 01:01:42,451
It's,

2068
01:01:42,451 --> 01:01:44,390
which I'm not too late at.

2069
01:01:44,400 --> 01:01:45,150
Darn.

2070
01:01:45,150 --> 01:01:46,650
So you're on this show.

2071
01:01:48,150 --> 01:01:48,983
I'll take that.

2072
01:01:49,500 --> 01:01:54,000
So I'm an advisor to this company called
the heart math institute and heart math

2073
01:01:54,001 --> 01:01:55,980
makes a heart rate
variability training device.

2074
01:01:56,280 --> 01:01:57,750
These guys are Silicon Valley geeks.

2075
01:01:57,751 --> 01:02:01,770
They spent 20 years looking
at like meditation and how
you quantify meditation,

2076
01:02:01,771 --> 01:02:02,940
like what's going on in the body.

2077
01:02:03,450 --> 01:02:06,660
And it turns out by looking at the
spacing between your heartbeats,

2078
01:02:06,840 --> 01:02:10,350
you can totally change the way your
brain works in the way your body works.

2079
01:02:10,800 --> 01:02:12,390
And in the course of their research,

2080
01:02:12,420 --> 01:02:16,140
they went out and they did some really
heavy duty science and there's actually a

2081
01:02:16,141 --> 01:02:17,640
magnetic field around your heart.

2082
01:02:17,641 --> 01:02:19,470
It's tipped it like a 12 degree angle way.

2083
01:02:19,471 --> 01:02:20,370
It's shaped like a tourist,

2084
01:02:20,371 --> 01:02:21,204
like a donut.

2085
01:02:21,240 --> 01:02:22,820
And they know which direction the fields,

2086
01:02:22,860 --> 01:02:23,160
uh,

2087
01:02:23,160 --> 01:02:24,150
move on it and everything.

2088
01:02:24,540 --> 01:02:26,640
So it's the most electrically
active part of your bodies.

2089
01:02:26,641 --> 01:02:27,990
You're hired and get this.

2090
01:02:28,500 --> 01:02:31,080
When a human walks into
a stall with a horse,

2091
01:02:31,081 --> 01:02:32,280
before they touched the horse,

2092
01:02:32,310 --> 01:02:35,910
the horse is heart rate variability
will change to match the humans.

2093
01:02:36,240 --> 01:02:40,140
We have a field of fact on the people
around us and it's an electromagnetic

2094
01:02:40,141 --> 01:02:43,560
field that's heart-based and like we
can measure it and people get pissed off

2095
01:02:43,561 --> 01:02:45,930
when they hear this and then they
just think everything I say is crap.

2096
01:02:46,170 --> 01:02:47,790
It's not like a,

2097
01:02:47,791 --> 01:02:50,130
I know the scientists who
are behind this and B,

2098
01:02:50,340 --> 01:02:52,950
I'm a certified heart
math executive coach.

2099
01:02:52,951 --> 01:02:56,550
Like I use this to take people who are
super high performers who are tweaking

2100
01:02:56,551 --> 01:03:00,060
because of their stress and to teach
them to consciously basically use their

2101
01:03:00,061 --> 01:03:00,841
prefrontal cortex.

2102
01:03:00,841 --> 01:03:05,010
They're human most evolved part of the
brain to to train and take control of the

2103
01:03:05,011 --> 01:03:09,030
reptilian brain and when you do that
there's measurable changes in the spacing

2104
01:03:09,031 --> 01:03:11,880
of your heartbeats and there's a change
in the field or on your heart as well.

2105
01:03:12,090 --> 01:03:12,721
When you do that,

2106
01:03:12,721 --> 01:03:13,280
that's what you're,

2107
01:03:13,280 --> 01:03:14,113
that's what you're feeling there.

2108
01:03:14,130 --> 01:03:15,120
Someone's pissed off at you.

2109
01:03:15,330 --> 01:03:18,180
They could not say a word and you might
not even see their face when you just

2110
01:03:18,181 --> 01:03:19,014
have a feeling.

2111
01:03:19,680 --> 01:03:22,140
We also know Bobby is letting you
know some shit might be going down.

2112
01:03:22,141 --> 01:03:24,720
I'm catching something bad
smells and in fact one of my,

2113
01:03:24,840 --> 01:03:28,640
one of my buddies is a special forces
guy and he actually wasn't technically

2114
01:03:28,660 --> 01:03:29,610
trained special forces guys.

2115
01:03:29,611 --> 01:03:32,490
He was a long range patrol officer
guy and he told me one day,

2116
01:03:32,491 --> 01:03:32,750
he said,

2117
01:03:32,750 --> 01:03:33,583
Dave,

2118
01:03:34,260 --> 01:03:35,400
what we learned out in the field,

2119
01:03:35,401 --> 01:03:35,700
he said,

2120
01:03:35,700 --> 01:03:37,020
if you're in someone's sites,

2121
01:03:37,110 --> 01:03:38,010
you can feel it.

2122
01:03:38,040 --> 01:03:38,341
He said,

2123
01:03:38,341 --> 01:03:39,920
if someone's got a gun
pointed at you like you're,

2124
01:03:39,921 --> 01:03:41,040
your body heats up.

2125
01:03:41,370 --> 01:03:41,621
Like,

2126
01:03:41,621 --> 01:03:43,980
like literally how the heck
could this be possible?

2127
01:03:44,220 --> 01:03:46,710
But the bottom line is we have
all sorts of weird senses.

2128
01:03:46,980 --> 01:03:51,060
We also know if we hook you up Joe to
like weird galvanic skin response sensors

2129
01:03:51,480 --> 01:03:54,960
and then you're sitting there if
someone's staring at you will be able to

2130
01:03:54,961 --> 01:03:58,170
measure your body responding to the stair
even if they're staring at your back.

2131
01:03:58,590 --> 01:04:01,290
Like there's all kinds of crazy stuff
in our bodies we haven't even really

2132
01:04:01,291 --> 01:04:02,124
explored yet.

2133
01:04:02,160 --> 01:04:05,460
Do you think those are evolving senses
or do you think those are just like

2134
01:04:05,461 --> 01:04:09,090
really sort of intangible senses
that we haven't quite defined?

2135
01:04:09,360 --> 01:04:10,770
They're not evolving senses.

2136
01:04:10,771 --> 01:04:11,970
Their old senses.

2137
01:04:12,030 --> 01:04:13,740
Those were there long before.

2138
01:04:14,120 --> 01:04:14,590
You know what?

2139
01:04:14,590 --> 01:04:16,800
What makes the the frog
move before the Eagle John,

2140
01:04:16,801 --> 01:04:18,180
before the eagle dives for it,

2141
01:04:18,400 --> 01:04:18,900
right.

2142
01:04:18,900 --> 01:04:19,950
It's those kinds of senses.

2143
01:04:19,980 --> 01:04:20,581
It's a very,

2144
01:04:20,581 --> 01:04:23,640
very low level survival oriented census.

2145
01:04:24,520 --> 01:04:25,350
Um,

2146
01:04:25,350 --> 01:04:26,820
you sure they're not evolving,

2147
01:04:26,880 --> 01:04:27,720
they're not getting better.

2148
01:04:27,721 --> 01:04:28,200
Maybe.

2149
01:04:28,200 --> 01:04:31,260
I think what's happening is that our
ability to access them from our prefrontal

2150
01:04:31,261 --> 01:04:32,400
cortex is evolving.

2151
01:04:32,430 --> 01:04:34,530
And that's one of the things I
spend a lot of my own time on.

2152
01:04:34,540 --> 01:04:39,540
I spent $20,000 and seven days hooked
up to an EEG machine to learn how to do

2153
01:04:39,841 --> 01:04:41,230
like advanced zen meditation.

2154
01:04:41,280 --> 01:04:42,390
That takes 40 years.

2155
01:04:42,890 --> 01:04:43,920
I didn't seven days.

2156
01:04:44,370 --> 01:04:47,010
And what you're really doing there is
you're just learning how to have the

2157
01:04:47,011 --> 01:04:47,761
prefrontal Cortex,

2158
01:04:47,761 --> 01:04:49,890
your human brain talk to
the low level systems.

2159
01:04:50,130 --> 01:04:50,963
And when you do that,

2160
01:04:51,120 --> 01:04:55,500
like you can unleash creativity and
intelligence and intuition in ways that,

2161
01:04:55,790 --> 01:04:56,180
you know,

2162
01:04:56,180 --> 01:04:58,020
most people aren't that familiar with.

2163
01:04:58,050 --> 01:05:02,320
What do you think is going on when you
see people that are our kids usually that

2164
01:05:02,321 --> 01:05:04,860
are autistic but they're
super genius in one area.

2165
01:05:05,070 --> 01:05:06,690
Like there was one kid that was making,

2166
01:05:06,740 --> 01:05:07,290
uh,

2167
01:05:07,290 --> 01:05:12,090
he was composing a symphony every nine
days or something like that and they were

2168
01:05:12,091 --> 01:05:12,601
really good.

2169
01:05:12,601 --> 01:05:13,560
It was really good music.

2170
01:05:13,561 --> 01:05:17,440
And then there's a kid who can look out
a window and out of an airplane and the

2171
01:05:17,441 --> 01:05:18,370
entire skyline

2172
01:05:18,370 --> 01:05:19,780
as he sees it perfectly.

2173
01:05:19,960 --> 01:05:24,490
Like do you think that that's evolving
possibilities in the brain that are just

2174
01:05:24,491 --> 01:05:26,200
starting to sort of pop up?

2175
01:05:26,350 --> 01:05:26,950
I don't.

2176
01:05:26,950 --> 01:05:27,490
You don't.

2177
01:05:27,490 --> 01:05:31,450
And I say that I had all the symptoms
of Asperger's syndrome till I was in my

2178
01:05:31,450 --> 01:05:33,640
mid twenties like obsessive
compulsive disorder,

2179
01:05:33,641 --> 01:05:35,020
oppositional defiant disorder.

2180
01:05:35,021 --> 01:05:36,100
I didn't know anyone's name,

2181
01:05:36,370 --> 01:05:38,080
like I wouldn't make eye contact,

2182
01:05:38,081 --> 01:05:38,771
all that kind of stuff.

2183
01:05:38,771 --> 01:05:43,771
I stuttered a little bit and I've done
a lot of work with the autism community.

2184
01:05:43,871 --> 01:05:44,500
In fact,

2185
01:05:44,500 --> 01:05:47,530
one of my goals in this book that I'm
writing to the better baby book that comes

2186
01:05:47,531 --> 01:05:51,940
out in January is to have less kids
with autism because you can handle

2187
01:05:51,941 --> 01:05:53,590
neurological inflammation
even in the womb,

2188
01:05:53,591 --> 01:05:55,360
so there's less likelihood
of it happening later.

2189
01:05:56,200 --> 01:05:59,710
What we can do though is we can take
a fully functioning neurologically

2190
01:05:59,711 --> 01:06:03,280
functioning adult and we can hit them
with really strong magnets in their head

2191
01:06:03,281 --> 01:06:06,130
and we can turn on autistic
skills and non autistic people.

2192
01:06:06,370 --> 01:06:09,250
So you can suddenly draw the most
amazing thing ever when you have a 10 ton

2193
01:06:09,251 --> 01:06:10,450
magnet focused on your head.

2194
01:06:10,810 --> 01:06:11,530
Whoa.

2195
01:06:11,530 --> 01:06:12,363
Oh yeah.

2196
01:06:12,400 --> 01:06:15,220
So this is some serious brain hacking
stuff like that fucking dude from the

2197
01:06:15,221 --> 01:06:16,690
expert and that magneto dude,

2198
01:06:18,220 --> 01:06:19,290
I hadn't thought of it like that.

2199
01:06:19,291 --> 01:06:19,410
Yeah,

2200
01:06:19,410 --> 01:06:20,560
that's exactly what it is.

2201
01:06:20,620 --> 01:06:23,650
It is Hema goddamn genius with
that magnet helmet on member.

2202
01:06:23,710 --> 01:06:23,921
Yeah.

2203
01:06:23,921 --> 01:06:25,520
And they're doing this like in a,

2204
01:06:25,900 --> 01:06:26,140
uh,

2205
01:06:26,140 --> 01:06:27,700
in neuroscience laboratories right now.

2206
01:06:27,701 --> 01:06:30,790
Like they have this really focused
thing that that shines a magnet and it

2207
01:06:30,820 --> 01:06:32,530
activates a specific part of your brain.

2208
01:06:32,770 --> 01:06:35,860
You can even do it to some extent
with the stuff having my backpack,

2209
01:06:35,861 --> 01:06:38,440
like a cerebral electrical
stimulation or tdcs,

2210
01:06:38,680 --> 01:06:41,170
you can run a current through part
of your brain and turned it on.

2211
01:06:41,350 --> 01:06:43,990
It wasn't turned on before and as
long as there's electricity there,

2212
01:06:43,991 --> 01:06:44,824
it's turned on.

2213
01:06:45,070 --> 01:06:47,710
So I think what's going on here
is the wiring and autistic kids,

2214
01:06:47,950 --> 01:06:51,970
they have chronic neurological
inflammation that's
environmentally mediated and

2215
01:06:51,971 --> 01:06:54,100
these you have problems with
the biology and their gut too.

2216
01:06:54,550 --> 01:06:56,800
So what we can do though is we can learn,

2217
01:06:56,801 --> 01:06:57,071
okay,

2218
01:06:57,071 --> 01:06:58,420
these autistic kids have these skills.

2219
01:06:58,450 --> 01:06:59,710
All of us have these skills too.

2220
01:06:59,711 --> 01:07:01,480
They're just not trained
and they're not turned on.

2221
01:07:02,020 --> 01:07:03,220
If you use technology,

2222
01:07:03,221 --> 01:07:06,970
you can train your brain to do crazy
stuff in very short periods of time so you

2223
01:07:06,971 --> 01:07:11,080
can gain these kind of powers without
having to give up the ability to socialize

2224
01:07:11,081 --> 01:07:11,914
for instance.

2225
01:07:12,130 --> 01:07:17,130
But a kid looking out a window and and
being able to capture the exact skyline

2226
01:07:17,651 --> 01:07:20,020
and then put that to paper as he,

2227
01:07:20,130 --> 01:07:20,650
you know,

2228
01:07:20,650 --> 01:07:22,510
I don't know if these are
classically trained artist.

2229
01:07:22,750 --> 01:07:23,710
I think he just does it.

2230
01:07:24,450 --> 01:07:26,650
That is a really special skill.

2231
01:07:26,680 --> 01:07:27,700
It's a special skill,

2232
01:07:27,730 --> 01:07:31,840
but I'll bet you that if we took six
months and we use those magnets and things

2233
01:07:31,841 --> 01:07:32,261
like that,

2234
01:07:32,261 --> 01:07:32,680
we can,

2235
01:07:32,680 --> 01:07:35,680
we can explore how his brain works and
teach your brain to do the same thing.

2236
01:07:35,920 --> 01:07:38,680
There's a lot of things out there that
are way teachable that you wouldn't think

2237
01:07:38,681 --> 01:07:39,490
are,

2238
01:07:39,490 --> 01:07:41,870
it's all just about
interfacing with the brain.

2239
01:07:41,871 --> 01:07:43,660
And the way we do it now
is really inefficient.

2240
01:07:43,810 --> 01:07:45,590
If I have a gigantic magnet on my head,

2241
01:07:45,591 --> 01:07:45,731
boy,

2242
01:07:45,731 --> 01:07:46,660
I played better pool.

2243
01:07:47,430 --> 01:07:47,930
Uh,

2244
01:07:47,930 --> 01:07:50,290
I think it depends on how much
the magnet weight is probably,

2245
01:07:50,650 --> 01:07:50,891
well,

2246
01:07:50,891 --> 01:07:51,310
I mean,

2247
01:07:51,310 --> 01:07:53,020
as far as like the frequent,

2248
01:07:53,350 --> 01:07:53,981
it needs something,

2249
01:07:53,981 --> 01:07:55,150
it's not something you'd wear.

2250
01:07:55,180 --> 01:07:56,960
It's not something you're
wearing this little bit.

2251
01:07:57,000 --> 01:07:57,520
Laceless.

2252
01:07:57,520 --> 01:07:58,510
When I say 10 tons,

2253
01:07:58,511 --> 01:08:00,940
I mean like this is a 10 ton
thing that that changes it.

2254
01:08:00,970 --> 01:08:03,310
And there's various like
articles from neuroscientist,

2255
01:08:03,311 --> 01:08:03,641
they went in,

2256
01:08:03,641 --> 01:08:06,190
they did the test and they drew
like the most amazing artwork.

2257
01:08:06,640 --> 01:08:06,880
Uh,

2258
01:08:06,880 --> 01:08:10,600
or in the military they do other things
like that with more with electricity.

2259
01:08:10,601 --> 01:08:11,500
But they'll say,

2260
01:08:11,530 --> 01:08:11,861
oh look,

2261
01:08:11,861 --> 01:08:13,450
this person got a stimulation here.

2262
01:08:13,451 --> 01:08:15,500
And they went through the shooting
simulation and they killed everyone

2263
01:08:15,501 --> 01:08:15,951
completely.

2264
01:08:15,951 --> 01:08:18,200
Whereas the last time they
had no skills at all real.

2265
01:08:18,290 --> 01:08:18,920
Oh yeah.

2266
01:08:18,920 --> 01:08:20,990
So like your brain is
like such an amazing toy.

2267
01:08:21,200 --> 01:08:22,760
You can completely change it.

2268
01:08:22,880 --> 01:08:24,060
But here's the thing you want,

2269
01:08:24,140 --> 01:08:25,910
you want to maximize this performance.

2270
01:08:26,180 --> 01:08:28,280
You need to myelinate
the nerves in your brain.

2271
01:08:28,520 --> 01:08:33,500
Myelination makes a nerve carry electrical
signals 3000 times faster than a non

2272
01:08:33,501 --> 01:08:34,334
myelinated nerve.

2273
01:08:34,370 --> 01:08:35,810
So first you have to
form the synapse apps,

2274
01:08:35,811 --> 01:08:37,040
which is called synaptic genesis.

2275
01:08:37,041 --> 01:08:39,560
And you do that through relatively
short amounts of practice.

2276
01:08:39,920 --> 01:08:40,071
You know,

2277
01:08:40,071 --> 01:08:40,904
the first time you learned,

2278
01:08:41,500 --> 01:08:41,630
well,

2279
01:08:41,630 --> 01:08:43,100
the first time you learned
to balance on your bike,

2280
01:08:43,340 --> 01:08:43,640
right?

2281
01:08:43,640 --> 01:08:44,040
Like you've,

2282
01:08:44,040 --> 01:08:45,140
you've learned how to do it.

2283
01:08:45,140 --> 01:08:47,750
It doesn't take long from
then on though to get it.

2284
01:08:47,751 --> 01:08:48,800
So it's just automatic.

2285
01:08:48,950 --> 01:08:50,150
That's what repetition does.

2286
01:08:50,450 --> 01:08:53,630
And you've had a lot of pro sports guys
and here they talking about 10,000 times

2287
01:08:53,631 --> 01:08:54,464
and repetitions.

2288
01:08:54,560 --> 01:08:56,960
The reason 10,000 times works
is because you're myelinating.

2289
01:08:57,230 --> 01:08:57,801
But here's the thing,

2290
01:08:57,801 --> 01:08:58,730
what's my island made out of?

2291
01:08:58,790 --> 01:08:59,623
Fat,

2292
01:08:59,750 --> 01:09:00,583
cholesterol,

2293
01:09:00,590 --> 01:09:01,423
Coleen.

2294
01:09:01,610 --> 01:09:04,460
So what you need to do is you need to
be cranking up on those kinds of foods.

2295
01:09:04,490 --> 01:09:07,760
And if you're going to be on a low fat
or a Vegan Diet that doesn't have any of

2296
01:09:07,761 --> 01:09:09,830
the saturated fats and as low and Coleen,

2297
01:09:10,280 --> 01:09:13,340
you're probably gonna have
a harder time myelinating.

2298
01:09:13,341 --> 01:09:15,230
It's gonna be harder for your brain
to do what it was meant to do.

2299
01:09:15,260 --> 01:09:17,120
So synaptic speaking,

2300
01:09:17,150 --> 01:09:18,530
it's harder to learn things.

2301
01:09:18,810 --> 01:09:19,490
Yup.

2302
01:09:19,490 --> 01:09:20,450
If you don't have enough fat,

2303
01:09:20,780 --> 01:09:22,400
you've got to have fat for
your brain to function.

2304
01:09:22,490 --> 01:09:22,671
I mean,

2305
01:09:22,671 --> 01:09:23,540
your brain is made out of fat,

2306
01:09:23,930 --> 01:09:25,550
but you don't want the wrong fat.

2307
01:09:25,580 --> 01:09:28,220
You don't want fat from a
stupid cow that ate corn.

2308
01:09:28,280 --> 01:09:28,541
No,

2309
01:09:28,541 --> 01:09:28,880
you're done.

2310
01:09:28,880 --> 01:09:29,660
You're all stupid.

2311
01:09:29,660 --> 01:09:29,821
Yeah.

2312
01:09:29,821 --> 01:09:31,820
And you don't want fat that's
been impregnated with toxins.

2313
01:09:32,030 --> 01:09:33,640
So you got to have grass fed meat.

2314
01:09:33,690 --> 01:09:37,670
You got to have it from some sort of
a reputable source where you know that

2315
01:09:37,671 --> 01:09:40,010
they're not feeding the any antibiotics.

2316
01:09:40,350 --> 01:09:42,110
How do you put the magnets on the cows,

2317
01:09:42,111 --> 01:09:42,944
Joe?

2318
01:09:43,120 --> 01:09:43,931
That's awesome.

2319
01:09:43,931 --> 01:09:45,490
I blew my fucking mind.

2320
01:09:45,491 --> 01:09:46,324
Yes.

2321
01:09:47,530 --> 01:09:48,550
Magnet Fed beef.

2322
01:09:48,551 --> 01:09:51,130
It's the cows started walking
up to the fence going,

2323
01:09:51,131 --> 01:09:52,060
I think we can get through it.

2324
01:09:52,061 --> 01:09:53,510
We just knock one of
these fucking things over.

2325
01:09:54,170 --> 01:09:58,150
The magneto helmet with the horns on it
to match of cows started figuring out

2326
01:09:58,151 --> 01:09:59,320
that it just fuck us up.

2327
01:10:00,340 --> 01:10:01,800
The corn just grows there.

2328
01:10:01,820 --> 01:10:02,651
Just let it grow.

2329
01:10:02,651 --> 01:10:03,700
It will grow by itself.

2330
01:10:03,730 --> 01:10:04,570
I found that video.

2331
01:10:04,571 --> 01:10:06,670
If you wanted to watch
the nuclear explosion.

2332
01:10:06,680 --> 01:10:07,360
Yes.

2333
01:10:07,360 --> 01:10:07,601
Yeah.

2334
01:10:07,601 --> 01:10:08,230
Let's see this.

2335
01:10:08,230 --> 01:10:09,063
This is crazy,

2336
01:10:13,060 --> 01:10:13,450
Matt.

2337
01:10:13,450 --> 01:10:13,811
This is,

2338
01:10:13,811 --> 01:10:14,171
by the way,

2339
01:10:14,171 --> 01:10:14,951
just America.

2340
01:10:14,951 --> 01:10:16,090
There's one of the world.

2341
01:10:16,360 --> 01:10:16,541
Oh,

2342
01:10:16,541 --> 01:10:17,410
this is the whole world.

2343
01:10:17,440 --> 01:10:17,561
Oh,

2344
01:10:17,561 --> 01:10:18,960
here it goes here.

2345
01:10:19,230 --> 01:10:20,530
See how it'd be like soccer,

2346
01:10:20,531 --> 01:10:20,890
soccer.

2347
01:10:20,890 --> 01:10:21,723
Hiroshima.

2348
01:10:21,760 --> 01:10:22,593
Yeah.

2349
01:10:24,720 --> 01:10:25,710
This is so creepy.

2350
01:10:26,190 --> 01:10:27,090
We're so nuts.

2351
01:10:28,770 --> 01:10:32,640
Here's a crazy statistic that we figured
out in a podcast from the invention of

2352
01:10:32,641 --> 01:10:36,990
the airplane to someone using it to
drop a nuclear bomb on someone took less

2353
01:10:36,991 --> 01:10:37,920
than 50 years.

2354
01:10:37,980 --> 01:10:39,120
That's pretty impressive.

2355
01:10:39,230 --> 01:10:40,063
That's insane.

2356
01:10:40,080 --> 01:10:40,590
Wow.

2357
01:10:40,590 --> 01:10:42,660
Think about that as like a world changing.

2358
01:10:42,840 --> 01:10:43,261
Yeah.

2359
01:10:43,261 --> 01:10:44,830
It makes Moore's law look kind of sissy.

2360
01:10:45,200 --> 01:10:47,070
That's pretty amazing.

2361
01:10:47,280 --> 01:10:48,060
You know,

2362
01:10:48,060 --> 01:10:49,050
50 years later,

2363
01:10:49,051 --> 01:10:50,900
the dropping nuclear bombs out of them.

2364
01:10:53,700 --> 01:10:55,210
Russia starts jacking some off.

2365
01:10:55,220 --> 01:10:55,640
Fair.

2366
01:10:55,640 --> 01:10:56,620
Boom son.

2367
01:10:56,690 --> 01:10:57,523
There we go.

2368
01:10:57,680 --> 01:10:59,650
It starts just getting crazier
and crazier after this.

2369
01:10:59,651 --> 01:11:02,330
Right now we're up to eight from America.

2370
01:11:02,331 --> 01:11:03,350
One from Russia,

2371
01:11:07,850 --> 01:11:10,250
so not the sound of

2372
01:11:12,530 --> 01:11:13,590
how long has video

2373
01:11:14,500 --> 01:11:15,600
cause for the folks at homeless,

2374
01:11:17,460 --> 01:11:19,710
18 minutes of explosions,

2375
01:11:19,740 --> 01:11:21,060
but a lot of them were in,

2376
01:11:21,210 --> 01:11:22,320
there's a lot of Soviet Union.

2377
01:11:22,980 --> 01:11:24,300
Look at all those ones in Nevada.

2378
01:11:24,360 --> 01:11:25,380
It just goes crazy.

2379
01:11:25,410 --> 01:11:27,270
Nevada just lights up
like a Christmas tree.

2380
01:11:27,360 --> 01:11:28,420
They were all in Nevada.

2381
01:11:29,500 --> 01:11:30,690
All Nevada,

2382
01:11:31,940 --> 01:11:32,540
Britain.

2383
01:11:32,540 --> 01:11:33,291
How dare you?

2384
01:11:33,291 --> 01:11:35,030
Sons of bitches in the ocean.

2385
01:11:35,031 --> 01:11:35,331
Yeah,

2386
01:11:35,331 --> 01:11:36,164
you cowards.

2387
01:11:37,230 --> 01:11:38,130
But I'm in the ocean.

2388
01:11:38,790 --> 01:11:39,623
Look at Nevada.

2389
01:11:39,900 --> 01:11:40,850
Oh my God.

2390
01:11:40,920 --> 01:11:41,680
So scary.

2391
01:11:41,680 --> 01:11:43,620
They're all Nevada and explains Nevada,

2392
01:11:43,621 --> 01:11:44,040
doesn't it?

2393
01:11:44,040 --> 01:11:44,620
Fuck yeah.

2394
01:11:44,620 --> 01:11:45,950
Does Las Vegas right there?

2395
01:11:46,040 --> 01:11:48,270
It explains the reason
why it's allowed to exist.

2396
01:11:48,460 --> 01:11:49,670
I mean they do nuclear tests,

2397
01:11:49,810 --> 01:11:50,880
explains the airport.

2398
01:11:51,390 --> 01:11:53,490
They also bury a,

2399
01:11:53,491 --> 01:11:57,170
they bury a lot of nuclear waste
out there and not in Vegas,

2400
01:11:57,171 --> 01:11:58,140
but and look at Russia.

2401
01:11:58,141 --> 01:11:58,974
It's still glowing.

2402
01:11:58,980 --> 01:12:00,510
Scary shit man.

2403
01:12:01,530 --> 01:12:02,101
Oh my God.

2404
01:12:02,101 --> 01:12:03,390
More Devonta look at that.

2405
01:12:03,391 --> 01:12:07,290
And that's something 1955 looking at
how many of them are going off in Nevada

2406
01:12:07,291 --> 01:12:09,000
that is fucking bananas.

2407
01:12:09,220 --> 01:12:14,220
And compare that to like the recent
a nuclear reactor leak in Japan.

2408
01:12:16,410 --> 01:12:17,760
I don't know if this might be worse.

2409
01:12:18,120 --> 01:12:18,691
I don't know.

2410
01:12:18,691 --> 01:12:19,260
I think,

2411
01:12:19,260 --> 01:12:19,510
uh,

2412
01:12:19,510 --> 01:12:21,690
I don't know which one lasts more.

2413
01:12:21,960 --> 01:12:22,111
Yeah,

2414
01:12:22,111 --> 01:12:23,190
that was pretty brutal.

2415
01:12:24,030 --> 01:12:26,340
But they also have shit
buried out there too.

2416
01:12:26,580 --> 01:12:28,470
They're storing nuclear waste out there.

2417
01:12:28,860 --> 01:12:29,340
Yeah.

2418
01:12:29,340 --> 01:12:33,390
Spent nuclear rods and all kinds of other
shit that they think will be toxic to

2419
01:12:33,391 --> 01:12:34,224
the end of time.

2420
01:12:34,700 --> 01:12:35,940
We're just so ridiculous.

2421
01:12:36,210 --> 01:12:39,450
It's just so weird that we would have
something like that and just fucking start

2422
01:12:40,620 --> 01:12:41,453
look at this.

2423
01:12:41,800 --> 01:12:42,633
Wow.

2424
01:12:42,820 --> 01:12:44,050
It's kind of sounds like music.

2425
01:12:44,700 --> 01:12:45,533
Look how many

2426
01:12:45,790 --> 01:12:46,940
balms have gone off.

2427
01:12:46,990 --> 01:12:48,040
300 moms

2428
01:12:48,520 --> 01:12:51,680
and we're still in the 1960 like we
haven't even gotten into the mind.

2429
01:12:52,010 --> 01:12:54,820
It's a 1959 and there's been 300 bombs.

2430
01:12:54,850 --> 01:12:55,390
Wow.

2431
01:12:55,390 --> 01:12:56,560
This is really hard to watch,

2432
01:12:56,561 --> 01:12:57,700
but no kidding.

2433
01:12:58,110 --> 01:12:58,943
Total down here.

2434
01:12:59,230 --> 01:13:00,520
They were so stupid back.

2435
01:13:00,521 --> 01:13:02,500
Do you have any Justin Bieber
videos we can watch and stuff?

2436
01:13:03,700 --> 01:13:04,180
Yeah,

2437
01:13:04,180 --> 01:13:04,991
I think we should kill that.

2438
01:13:04,991 --> 01:13:05,824
Brian,

2439
01:13:06,230 --> 01:13:09,160
what are you concerned about?

2440
01:13:09,190 --> 01:13:13,570
Like the toxic shit that's
going to happen from Fukushima.

2441
01:13:13,571 --> 01:13:16,090
Is that going to affect people
that live here on the west coast?

2442
01:13:16,240 --> 01:13:16,301
Yeah,

2443
01:13:16,301 --> 01:13:16,631
it is.

2444
01:13:16,631 --> 01:13:17,464
I mean the,

2445
01:13:17,470 --> 01:13:18,820
the plume,

2446
01:13:18,821 --> 01:13:19,451
so to speak,

2447
01:13:19,451 --> 01:13:20,470
is making its way over here.

2448
01:13:20,471 --> 01:13:22,120
Now what does that mean?

2449
01:13:22,150 --> 01:13:25,810
We're actually finding a huge amounts
of wreckage that are hitting the shore

2450
01:13:25,811 --> 01:13:26,081
now.

2451
01:13:26,081 --> 01:13:26,381
In fact,

2452
01:13:26,381 --> 01:13:27,660
up where I live in British Columbia,

2453
01:13:27,670 --> 01:13:28,000
like it,

2454
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:28,760
it's a big thing.

2455
01:13:28,760 --> 01:13:31,750
They're finding like motorcycles
and something like hundred ton,

2456
01:13:31,810 --> 01:13:34,390
like cement docs that sort
of walks wash up and like,

2457
01:13:34,420 --> 01:13:35,590
how do I get rid of this?

2458
01:13:35,800 --> 01:13:37,030
Like it's indestructible.

2459
01:13:37,060 --> 01:13:37,893
Oh my God.

2460
01:13:37,990 --> 01:13:41,530
A cement fucking doc that
was taken from Japan.

2461
01:13:41,531 --> 01:13:42,070
Yeah,

2462
01:13:42,070 --> 01:13:45,490
it broke free and it floated all the way
over here and it's like on the beach.

2463
01:13:45,520 --> 01:13:48,580
What's amazing is that
it's a little baby tsunami.

2464
01:13:48,610 --> 01:13:50,590
That ain't shit compared
to what could happen.

2465
01:13:50,620 --> 01:13:51,430
Oh yeah.

2466
01:13:51,430 --> 01:13:52,600
So that's happening.

2467
01:13:52,601 --> 01:13:55,300
But they say that the stuff that's
radioactive hasn't reached there yet.

2468
01:13:55,301 --> 01:13:57,070
So they're starting to,

2469
01:13:57,130 --> 01:13:59,290
they're starting to have a
Geiger counters on the beach,

2470
01:13:59,320 --> 01:14:02,860
like for the drunk cleanup crews to
see if they're finding this stuff.

2471
01:14:03,280 --> 01:14:03,971
So the question is,

2472
01:14:03,971 --> 01:14:05,110
what's it going to do to fish out here?

2473
01:14:05,111 --> 01:14:08,290
I show up at my sockeye
salmon is radioactive free.

2474
01:14:08,770 --> 01:14:09,640
And that said,

2475
01:14:09,641 --> 01:14:09,941
you know,

2476
01:14:09,941 --> 01:14:10,150
I,

2477
01:14:10,150 --> 01:14:13,420
I think taking iodine
iodine is a good idea.

2478
01:14:13,421 --> 01:14:13,990
I do that.

2479
01:14:13,990 --> 01:14:16,150
How does potassium iodine protect you?

2480
01:14:16,390 --> 01:14:16,611
Well,

2481
01:14:16,611 --> 01:14:20,560
if the form of radioactivity that
you're getting is radioactive iodine,

2482
01:14:20,590 --> 01:14:22,840
it protects you from getting
thyroid cancer years later.

2483
01:14:23,440 --> 01:14:25,510
The problem is that some of the
radioactive stuff coming out,

2484
01:14:25,540 --> 01:14:26,700
Fukushima may not be in an,

2485
01:14:26,710 --> 01:14:27,281
I died for him.

2486
01:14:27,281 --> 01:14:27,611
So I had,

2487
01:14:27,611 --> 01:14:28,780
I may not do much for you.

2488
01:14:29,260 --> 01:14:32,650
There's some evidence that asked us
Anthon which comes from Krill is pretty

2489
01:14:32,651 --> 01:14:33,670
protective as well.

2490
01:14:33,760 --> 01:14:35,110
So that's probably a good thing to take.

2491
01:14:36,040 --> 01:14:38,320
So krill Krill oil,

2492
01:14:38,321 --> 01:14:39,400
should you take it in that form?

2493
01:14:39,460 --> 01:14:41,140
I prefer Krill oil to fish oil.

2494
01:14:41,141 --> 01:14:42,970
I take Krill oil and I put,

2495
01:14:43,030 --> 01:14:43,350
uh,

2496
01:14:43,350 --> 01:14:44,320
and since I put,

2497
01:14:44,350 --> 01:14:46,600
I buy a form that has asked
as Anthony [inaudible],

2498
01:14:46,630 --> 01:14:48,730
which naturally occurs in the Krill,

2499
01:14:48,731 --> 01:14:50,110
it's the stuff that makes krill red.

2500
01:14:50,290 --> 01:14:54,070
It's just a really potent antioxidant
that has a good effect on radioactive

2501
01:14:54,071 --> 01:14:54,460
stuff.

2502
01:14:54,460 --> 01:14:58,750
This is a podcast that is going to test
your writing Shit Down Abilities Ladies

2503
01:14:58,751 --> 01:14:59,584
and gentlemen,

2504
01:14:59,640 --> 01:15:00,580
because this is a plug guys,

2505
01:15:00,581 --> 01:15:03,220
we're going to have to go back
[inaudible] assault by the way.

2506
01:15:03,221 --> 01:15:05,190
Jakks salts 11 it'll make Yag salt.

2507
01:15:05,200 --> 01:15:06,033
You Liar.

2508
01:15:06,620 --> 01:15:07,630
You're a fucking fibber.

2509
01:15:07,930 --> 01:15:08,763
How dare you.

2510
01:15:10,180 --> 01:15:10,390
Yeah,

2511
01:15:10,390 --> 01:15:11,223
I've got to get,

2512
01:15:11,350 --> 01:15:15,100
I'm going to go right to full wholefoods
right from here and get some fucking

2513
01:15:15,160 --> 01:15:18,250
Siberian salt or Tibetans salt.

2514
01:15:18,340 --> 01:15:19,090
Either one's good.

2515
01:15:19,090 --> 01:15:20,080
It tastes pretty good.

2516
01:15:20,081 --> 01:15:22,180
Like I like taking friends who are
not into health and you're like,

2517
01:15:22,181 --> 01:15:23,640
just try this salt and not quite,

2518
01:15:23,650 --> 01:15:26,770
you carry white vial of powder over
international borders with you.

2519
01:15:26,840 --> 01:15:27,261
Yeah.

2520
01:15:27,261 --> 01:15:28,690
Do you ever get tweaked on never.

2521
01:15:28,691 --> 01:15:29,111
It's weird.

2522
01:15:29,111 --> 01:15:29,181
I,

2523
01:15:29,181 --> 01:15:34,181
I mean I have like my upgraded whey
protein and collagen powder and like all

2524
01:15:34,541 --> 01:15:37,870
kinds of stuff that I should look like
I'm carrying kilos of random stuff.

2525
01:15:37,870 --> 01:15:41,620
But no one ever thought to ask you to
trust it or they never actually one time

2526
01:15:41,621 --> 01:15:43,600
I've had my whey protein
tested more often.

2527
01:15:43,601 --> 01:15:46,030
They checked my coffee cause
I don't drink hotel coffee.

2528
01:15:46,031 --> 01:15:46,821
It makes me feel crappy.

2529
01:15:46,821 --> 01:15:47,390
I just,

2530
01:15:47,390 --> 01:15:48,223
my coffee.

2531
01:15:48,370 --> 01:15:49,900
So I bring it with me just like,

2532
01:15:50,040 --> 01:15:50,230
you know,

2533
01:15:50,230 --> 01:15:51,850
beans or ground up coffee every time that,

2534
01:15:51,880 --> 01:15:52,001
oh,

2535
01:15:52,001 --> 01:15:52,451
what's that?

2536
01:15:52,451 --> 01:15:54,730
And then they open it and they seems
like they just want to smell it maybe,

2537
01:15:54,731 --> 01:15:55,480
I don't know.

2538
01:15:55,480 --> 01:15:58,010
Well it is that also the
people how drugs and coffee.

2539
01:15:58,020 --> 01:15:59,880
It's the easiest way because it does,

2540
01:16:00,370 --> 01:16:03,070
it stops the dogs from
smelling the marijuana.

2541
01:16:03,360 --> 01:16:03,731
You know,

2542
01:16:03,731 --> 01:16:04,151
it's funny,

2543
01:16:04,151 --> 01:16:07,170
I have a little a heard we've heard,

2544
01:16:07,330 --> 01:16:08,320
I have a little canister,

2545
01:16:08,321 --> 01:16:12,010
I put it in there that that's got a
desk again that like absorbs moisture.

2546
01:16:12,130 --> 01:16:13,380
So I mean it looks like I've got a little,

2547
01:16:13,470 --> 01:16:16,960
a little canister of drugs
inside my coffee and twice
I've had people say what's

2548
01:16:16,961 --> 01:16:19,090
in there and like keeps
the coffee dry and they,

2549
01:16:19,180 --> 01:16:20,440
they just don't stop me.

2550
01:16:20,440 --> 01:16:21,970
And I fly like a hundred times a year,

2551
01:16:22,060 --> 01:16:22,900
like very often.

2552
01:16:23,200 --> 01:16:23,800
Wow.

2553
01:16:23,800 --> 01:16:26,680
I drink a Trenta of coffee
every single day and then,

2554
01:16:26,681 --> 01:16:29,080
then I eat my first meal
about eight o'clock at night.

2555
01:16:29,110 --> 01:16:29,460
Nice.

2556
01:16:29,460 --> 01:16:29,590
That,

2557
01:16:29,590 --> 01:16:30,430
does it seem like,

2558
01:16:30,431 --> 01:16:32,650
I used to put butter in my coffee now?

2559
01:16:32,710 --> 01:16:33,980
Is that what you would recommend?

2560
01:16:33,981 --> 01:16:34,814
I would try it.

2561
01:16:35,110 --> 01:16:35,870
I seriously,

2562
01:16:35,870 --> 01:16:37,060
what if you're eating nothing else?

2563
01:16:37,320 --> 01:16:37,690
Yeah,

2564
01:16:37,690 --> 01:16:37,991
yeah.

2565
01:16:37,991 --> 01:16:39,190
I would try just some fat,

2566
01:16:39,191 --> 01:16:39,701
no sugar,

2567
01:16:39,701 --> 01:16:40,534
no protein,

2568
01:16:40,660 --> 01:16:41,171
but when you do that,

2569
01:16:41,171 --> 01:16:42,130
even just a tablespoon,

2570
01:16:42,190 --> 01:16:45,490
you may find that you have a lot more
energy throughout the day and splinters.

2571
01:16:45,520 --> 01:16:46,150
Okay,

2572
01:16:46,150 --> 01:16:48,100
like artificial sugar or
just stay away from it.

2573
01:16:48,130 --> 01:16:49,720
Just do Stevia if you're
going to do anything.

2574
01:16:50,020 --> 01:16:50,261
Yeah,

2575
01:16:50,261 --> 01:16:50,741
you can do is,

2576
01:16:50,741 --> 01:16:52,600
I will talk to a little bit was
that a tall won't raise your own,

2577
01:16:52,601 --> 01:16:53,560
stolen enough to matter,

2578
01:16:54,490 --> 01:16:56,620
but if you do a lot of Xylitol
and you're not used to it,

2579
01:16:56,660 --> 01:17:00,430
you'll get the runs like you'll take made
the bulletproof coffee with Stevia and

2580
01:17:00,431 --> 01:17:01,440
it was fucking delicious.

2581
01:17:01,870 --> 01:17:02,860
What was addicted to it?

2582
01:17:03,100 --> 01:17:03,880
It's really good,

2583
01:17:03,880 --> 01:17:06,400
but the problem is you're a lazy
bitch and you're not going to,

2584
01:17:06,440 --> 01:17:07,273
let's be honest,

2585
01:17:07,510 --> 01:17:11,960
you're not going to fucking get some
grass fed butter and melted and blend it.

2586
01:17:11,961 --> 01:17:14,630
You don't have to melt it and just
like toss the butter in the blender,

2587
01:17:14,631 --> 01:17:18,140
pour the hot coffee right in there
and hit blend for 2030 slave.

2588
01:17:18,230 --> 01:17:18,950
I may do that.

2589
01:17:18,950 --> 01:17:19,860
Needed to get one of you.

2590
01:17:20,030 --> 01:17:20,960
I'll get butter,

2591
01:17:21,290 --> 01:17:24,140
get Yulia butter and you can
get sent to your oil to you.

2592
01:17:24,220 --> 01:17:26,960
You know you could get groceries
now just delivered to your house.

2593
01:17:26,961 --> 01:17:27,710
It's amazing.

2594
01:17:27,710 --> 01:17:28,880
And it's not that much money.

2595
01:17:28,970 --> 01:17:32,780
Like you just go online and pick out
what you want and then it's just like,

2596
01:17:32,781 --> 01:17:33,051
all right,

2597
01:17:33,051 --> 01:17:33,890
we'll see you on an hour.

2598
01:17:33,891 --> 01:17:34,550
Like a pizza.

2599
01:17:34,550 --> 01:17:35,301
That's pretty sweet.

2600
01:17:35,301 --> 01:17:35,720
Yeah.

2601
01:17:35,720 --> 01:17:35,931
Wow,

2602
01:17:35,931 --> 01:17:36,501
that's amazing.

2603
01:17:36,501 --> 01:17:37,190
I didn't know that.

2604
01:17:37,190 --> 01:17:37,580
Yeah.

2605
01:17:37,580 --> 01:17:38,750
And plus butter keeps forever.

2606
01:17:38,780 --> 01:17:41,840
You can buy like 20 sticks of it and
toss it in the freezer and you'll have

2607
01:17:41,841 --> 01:17:44,810
butter coming out your eyes like so you,

2608
01:17:44,811 --> 01:17:49,610
you want to make sure when you go to
like organically raised beef is not good

2609
01:17:49,611 --> 01:17:49,881
enough.

2610
01:17:49,881 --> 01:17:51,470
It has to be grass fed,

2611
01:17:51,471 --> 01:17:52,660
organically raised.

2612
01:17:52,760 --> 01:17:54,170
You can take organic corn,

2613
01:17:54,171 --> 01:17:57,650
organic soil and organic Twinkies and
feed them to an organic cow and still sell

2614
01:17:57,651 --> 01:17:58,484
it as organic meat.

2615
01:17:58,820 --> 01:18:00,060
Like the standards are pretty low.

2616
01:18:00,070 --> 01:18:00,500
We keep,

2617
01:18:00,500 --> 01:18:01,760
Twinkies can be organic.

2618
01:18:02,180 --> 01:18:02,841
If they make one,

2619
01:18:02,841 --> 01:18:04,760
you can feed it to an organic
cow and it's still organic.

2620
01:18:04,850 --> 01:18:06,590
There's no standards
for what the cows eat.

2621
01:18:06,650 --> 01:18:08,510
It's just whether or not
what they ate was sprayed.

2622
01:18:09,080 --> 01:18:09,261
Oh,

2623
01:18:09,261 --> 01:18:09,680
I see.

2624
01:18:09,680 --> 01:18:10,490
Okay.

2625
01:18:10,490 --> 01:18:10,731
Um,

2626
01:18:10,731 --> 01:18:14,660
so but so for a lot of folks it's kind
of difficult to find grass fed meat in

2627
01:18:14,661 --> 01:18:15,140
your area.

2628
01:18:15,140 --> 01:18:17,870
Isn't it like a lot of
traditional supermarkets?

2629
01:18:17,900 --> 01:18:18,470
It is.

2630
01:18:18,470 --> 01:18:18,981
If you're,

2631
01:18:18,981 --> 01:18:19,131
you know,

2632
01:18:19,131 --> 01:18:19,941
in the middle of nowhere.

2633
01:18:19,941 --> 01:18:20,810
But here's the thing,

2634
01:18:20,840 --> 01:18:23,330
like Fedex and ups deliver everywhere.

2635
01:18:23,360 --> 01:18:27,890
It's cheaper to buy grass fed meat online
than it is to buy like a decent cut of

2636
01:18:27,891 --> 01:18:28,910
meat in a grocery store.

2637
01:18:29,240 --> 01:18:32,510
Like if you're going to buy grass fed
hamburger from some of the best places on

2638
01:18:32,511 --> 01:18:32,811
earth,

2639
01:18:32,811 --> 01:18:35,600
like I've like tested
different places on my site.

2640
01:18:35,601 --> 01:18:37,100
Like I have a whole series
is about grass fed beef.

2641
01:18:38,060 --> 01:18:39,740
You can get it for five bucks a pound,

2642
01:18:40,040 --> 01:18:41,720
like for grass fed,

2643
01:18:41,780 --> 01:18:43,670
perfectly treated animals.

2644
01:18:43,940 --> 01:18:44,540
Wow.

2645
01:18:44,540 --> 01:18:46,130
That's fucking really good.

2646
01:18:46,280 --> 01:18:46,551
Yeah.

2647
01:18:46,551 --> 01:18:47,210
And so like,

2648
01:18:47,210 --> 01:18:48,050
even if you're on a budget,

2649
01:18:48,051 --> 01:18:48,590
like okay,

2650
01:18:48,590 --> 01:18:50,880
eat a lot of eggs because
they're cheap and you know,

2651
01:18:50,900 --> 01:18:52,430
supplement with grass fed beef,

2652
01:18:52,900 --> 01:18:53,990
you had a half a pound a day,

2653
01:18:53,991 --> 01:18:55,520
it's going to cost you $2 and 50 cents.

2654
01:18:55,520 --> 01:18:56,840
Do you ever buy just fat?

2655
01:18:57,050 --> 01:18:57,651
Do you say like,

2656
01:18:57,651 --> 01:18:58,580
send me some fat.

2657
01:18:58,670 --> 01:18:59,810
I've bought beef tallow.

2658
01:18:59,840 --> 01:19:00,890
The problem is what's called,

2659
01:19:00,980 --> 01:19:01,670
yeah,

2660
01:19:01,670 --> 01:19:03,530
it's beef towels just rendered beef fat.

2661
01:19:03,560 --> 01:19:08,560
The problem is that the rendering process
is really finicky plus 15 finicky.

2662
01:19:09,141 --> 01:19:09,321
Well,

2663
01:19:09,321 --> 01:19:10,340
if you're going to render fat,

2664
01:19:10,370 --> 01:19:13,370
you need to have enough water in it in
order to render it so it doesn't oxidize.

2665
01:19:13,610 --> 01:19:14,391
One of the problems,

2666
01:19:14,391 --> 01:19:15,740
especially in the Paleo community,

2667
01:19:15,741 --> 01:19:16,610
and it drives me nuts.

2668
01:19:16,850 --> 01:19:17,900
People like Bacon,

2669
01:19:17,901 --> 01:19:18,021
like,

2670
01:19:18,021 --> 01:19:18,201
okay,

2671
01:19:18,201 --> 01:19:18,951
I love my bacon.

2672
01:19:18,951 --> 01:19:20,270
I'm a bacon snob.

2673
01:19:20,620 --> 01:19:20,961
I like,

2674
01:19:20,961 --> 01:19:21,860
I make my own bacon.

2675
01:19:22,150 --> 01:19:22,760
But what you've,

2676
01:19:22,760 --> 01:19:25,550
you've got to do though
is not overcook the oils.

2677
01:19:25,551 --> 01:19:25,821
If you,

2678
01:19:25,821 --> 01:19:28,460
if it's spitting all over the place and
there's smoke coming off the pan and

2679
01:19:28,461 --> 01:19:29,420
you're Bacon's crispy,

2680
01:19:29,570 --> 01:19:30,710
you've oxidized the fat.

2681
01:19:30,950 --> 01:19:34,010
And one of the things on the bulletproof
diet and I'm really focused on is like,

2682
01:19:34,011 --> 01:19:35,210
how do I get inflammation down?

2683
01:19:35,540 --> 01:19:37,700
So if you fry the crap out of your food,

2684
01:19:38,060 --> 01:19:40,790
then what you're getting
is inflammatory oils.

2685
01:19:40,791 --> 01:19:42,110
Even if they came from a good cow,

2686
01:19:42,140 --> 01:19:44,210
you're also getting delicious baked in.

2687
01:19:44,480 --> 01:19:45,320
That's a problem.

2688
01:19:45,350 --> 01:19:46,340
You're getting delicious bacon.

2689
01:19:46,341 --> 01:19:47,061
But here's the thing,

2690
01:19:47,061 --> 01:19:50,120
you put your stove on like three or
four and you cook the Bacon for longer.

2691
01:19:50,121 --> 01:19:51,530
All the fat melts out of the Bacon.

2692
01:19:51,830 --> 01:19:53,840
The Bacon does not going
to get all super crispy,

2693
01:19:53,960 --> 01:19:55,000
but it's a chewier begging,

2694
01:19:55,001 --> 01:19:55,170
right?

2695
01:19:55,170 --> 01:19:55,340
It's,

2696
01:19:55,340 --> 01:19:56,840
it's a little chewier but it's not like,

2697
01:19:57,080 --> 01:19:58,210
like bad.

2698
01:19:58,280 --> 01:20:00,590
She'll be like uncooked
bacon still awesome.

2699
01:20:00,710 --> 01:20:01,610
I like chewy big,

2700
01:20:02,210 --> 01:20:05,020
but I'll do like that fucked
up crispy Bacon Bacon.

2701
01:20:05,520 --> 01:20:06,201
It totally.

2702
01:20:06,201 --> 01:20:07,034
And like,

2703
01:20:07,100 --> 01:20:08,100
it's like we have like fried

2704
01:20:08,100 --> 01:20:08,731
Mozzarella too,

2705
01:20:08,731 --> 01:20:09,061
but like,

2706
01:20:09,061 --> 01:20:11,010
and he got to like choose
where you go on the spectrum.

2707
01:20:11,011 --> 01:20:12,330
What is it about fried things?

2708
01:20:12,331 --> 01:20:13,500
It's so horrible for you.

2709
01:20:13,560 --> 01:20:14,560
What does it do to your body?

2710
01:20:14,580 --> 01:20:15,870
It's mostly the damage fats.

2711
01:20:16,080 --> 01:20:17,160
They come in and your body's just like,

2712
01:20:17,190 --> 01:20:17,910
what do I do with this?

2713
01:20:17,910 --> 01:20:18,590
Fat?

2714
01:20:18,590 --> 01:20:20,450
Just can't process it
because it's overcooked.

2715
01:20:20,480 --> 01:20:20,660
Yeah.

2716
01:20:20,660 --> 01:20:20,940
It's like,

2717
01:20:20,940 --> 01:20:21,600
how do I,

2718
01:20:21,600 --> 01:20:22,830
how do I detoxify this?

2719
01:20:22,860 --> 01:20:26,370
So it's basically spitting out free
radicals and then you try and build cell

2720
01:20:26,371 --> 01:20:28,380
walls and hormones out of
this fat and your body.

2721
01:20:28,381 --> 01:20:28,801
Just like I do,

2722
01:20:28,801 --> 01:20:29,341
I do that.

2723
01:20:29,341 --> 01:20:30,690
I don't have the raw ingredients.

2724
01:20:31,020 --> 01:20:34,620
Why is it so fucking delicious
that I would love to know.

2725
01:20:35,130 --> 01:20:35,761
I think what?

2726
01:20:35,761 --> 01:20:37,290
What happens there for real,

2727
01:20:37,291 --> 01:20:37,560
right?

2728
01:20:37,560 --> 01:20:39,030
Like Kentucky Fried Chicken.

2729
01:20:39,270 --> 01:20:39,811
God Damn.

2730
01:20:39,811 --> 01:20:40,471
Well that Shit's good.

2731
01:20:40,471 --> 01:20:42,270
That's MSG and gluten and stuff ever.

2732
01:20:42,271 --> 01:20:42,930
It is.

2733
01:20:42,930 --> 01:20:43,763
I like it.

2734
01:20:43,830 --> 01:20:44,131
Yeah.

2735
01:20:44,131 --> 01:20:45,590
It was really MSG in gluten.

2736
01:20:45,640 --> 01:20:46,760
Oh Geez.

2737
01:20:46,830 --> 01:20:47,880
In like everything.

2738
01:20:48,110 --> 01:20:48,720
You know what?

2739
01:20:48,720 --> 01:20:49,950
It's God damn wonderful.

2740
01:20:50,670 --> 01:20:51,460
Don't change a thing.

2741
01:20:51,460 --> 01:20:52,380
Kentucky Fried Chicken.

2742
01:20:54,510 --> 01:20:57,000
We won't even talk about
Msg and obesity after that.

2743
01:20:57,210 --> 01:20:58,043
Yeah.

2744
01:20:58,230 --> 01:21:00,960
Well let's talk about how to
think about food in general,

2745
01:21:00,961 --> 01:21:01,950
whether it's Vegan or not.

2746
01:21:01,951 --> 01:21:02,431
Cause Google,

2747
01:21:02,431 --> 01:21:03,211
please explain though.

2748
01:21:03,211 --> 01:21:03,700
What did what,

2749
01:21:03,700 --> 01:21:06,810
what it does when your body takes in a,

2750
01:21:07,710 --> 01:21:09,450
just like Kentucky Fried
Chicken or anything.

2751
01:21:09,830 --> 01:21:11,880
Some of it's hydrogenated oil,

2752
01:21:11,881 --> 01:21:13,860
fried French fries and chips.

2753
01:21:13,861 --> 01:21:17,310
So we don't make healthy cell walls or
hormones or anything else in our body

2754
01:21:17,320 --> 01:21:17,881
made out of fat.

2755
01:21:17,881 --> 01:21:20,760
We didn't even burn
hydrogenated fat very well for,

2756
01:21:21,070 --> 01:21:21,270
uh,

2757
01:21:21,270 --> 01:21:21,990
for fuel.

2758
01:21:21,990 --> 01:21:22,701
So it basically is,

2759
01:21:22,701 --> 01:21:24,000
the liver has to detoxify it.

2760
01:21:24,001 --> 01:21:24,930
So it goes to the liver.

2761
01:21:24,931 --> 01:21:25,291
Liver was like,

2762
01:21:25,291 --> 01:21:25,681
Oh God,

2763
01:21:25,681 --> 01:21:26,610
what I do with this stuff.

2764
01:21:26,760 --> 01:21:29,040
So it starts using up the
glutathione in your liver,

2765
01:21:29,041 --> 01:21:30,510
which is the main detoxing enzyme.

2766
01:21:30,810 --> 01:21:33,690
It starts trying to figure out
how to break down these oils,

2767
01:21:33,870 --> 01:21:38,250
like were designed to take basically a
raw animal in and process it and to break

2768
01:21:38,251 --> 01:21:40,530
all those fats down into
reassemble them into our body.

2769
01:21:41,100 --> 01:21:41,850
We're not,

2770
01:21:41,850 --> 01:21:43,560
we're not meant to take those things in.

2771
01:21:43,561 --> 01:21:47,460
So what you get is actually a big rush
of white blood cells when you eat like

2772
01:21:47,461 --> 01:21:51,780
heavily cooked meat and the
oxidized fried fats and it actually,

2773
01:21:51,781 --> 01:21:53,760
it looks like an immune
response and your body's like,

2774
01:21:53,761 --> 01:21:54,031
okay,

2775
01:21:54,031 --> 01:21:55,260
I gotta do something about this.

2776
01:21:55,440 --> 01:21:57,750
So it does what it can to
build healthy cell walls,

2777
01:21:57,751 --> 01:21:59,370
but you get hungry after
you eat fried food.

2778
01:21:59,371 --> 01:22:00,204
If you ever noticed that,

2779
01:22:00,540 --> 01:22:03,240
like you feel full for well and afterwards
like I want like sugar or something,

2780
01:22:03,780 --> 01:22:05,580
the craving that you want for sugar,

2781
01:22:05,581 --> 01:22:08,670
they're either comes from the
MSG or it comes from your livers.

2782
01:22:08,671 --> 01:22:11,910
Like could I have some more fuel to use
to oxidize this stuff so I can excrete

2783
01:22:11,911 --> 01:22:13,230
it now instead of building it in?

2784
01:22:13,530 --> 01:22:14,363
Wow.

2785
01:22:14,700 --> 01:22:15,600
I never noticed that.

2786
01:22:15,601 --> 01:22:17,460
I usually feel like it's such a fat loser.

2787
01:22:17,570 --> 01:22:17,821
Oh yeah.

2788
01:22:17,821 --> 01:22:19,590
So you don't get like
hungry like your next meal.

2789
01:22:19,591 --> 01:22:19,861
You're like,

2790
01:22:19,861 --> 01:22:21,300
I don't like random cravings.

2791
01:22:21,360 --> 01:22:21,660
Okay,

2792
01:22:21,660 --> 01:22:21,901
cool.

2793
01:22:21,901 --> 01:22:24,270
Myself off I chicken.

2794
01:22:24,360 --> 01:22:25,120
Yeah,

2795
01:22:25,120 --> 01:22:25,271
but,

2796
01:22:25,271 --> 01:22:26,280
but I do like it like,

2797
01:22:26,430 --> 01:22:26,791
you know,

2798
01:22:26,791 --> 01:22:27,600
when I like it,

2799
01:22:27,600 --> 01:22:30,990
I like it like cold with hot sauce,

2800
01:22:31,120 --> 01:22:32,280
like watching stupid,

2801
01:22:32,340 --> 01:22:33,600
something stupid on TV.

2802
01:22:33,630 --> 01:22:34,620
It's a good snack.

2803
01:22:34,650 --> 01:22:35,730
Kentucky Fried Chicken,

2804
01:22:36,310 --> 01:22:37,710
you know the stuff tastes good.

2805
01:22:37,711 --> 01:22:39,150
I don't eat that stuff anymore.

2806
01:22:39,151 --> 01:22:41,550
I'm a delicate flower I guess
cause I weighed 300 pounds.

2807
01:22:41,560 --> 01:22:42,450
I just feel like crap.

2808
01:22:42,451 --> 01:22:43,070
I need it now.

2809
01:22:43,070 --> 01:22:43,261
Yeah.

2810
01:22:43,261 --> 01:22:44,290
I feel like crap when I needed to,

2811
01:22:44,310 --> 01:22:46,440
but I don't feel like
crap while I'm eating it.

2812
01:22:46,500 --> 01:22:47,430
That's the problem.

2813
01:22:47,510 --> 01:22:48,840
That's a fight while I'm eating it.

2814
01:22:48,841 --> 01:22:49,650
I'm loving it.

2815
01:22:49,650 --> 01:22:53,100
I'm loving the crispy outside
mixed with the hot sauce.

2816
01:22:55,760 --> 01:22:57,150
So if they had Kentucky Fried Kale,

2817
01:22:57,151 --> 01:22:57,970
would you try that?

2818
01:22:57,970 --> 01:22:58,211
My,

2819
01:22:58,211 --> 01:22:59,310
he kale all the time.

2820
01:22:59,370 --> 01:23:00,140
I mean I would do,

2821
01:23:00,140 --> 01:23:01,230
I eat kale chips.

2822
01:23:01,231 --> 01:23:01,530
I bike.

2823
01:23:01,530 --> 01:23:04,020
A lot of Kale chips have been
eaten those lately for snacks,

2824
01:23:04,290 --> 01:23:06,160
but I don't know what
they're the cheese out of.

2825
01:23:06,161 --> 01:23:06,821
You know the cause.

2826
01:23:06,821 --> 01:23:08,050
It's some weird Vegan.

2827
01:23:08,051 --> 01:23:08,950
It's usually new use.

2828
01:23:08,951 --> 01:23:10,270
It's usually a nutritional yeast,

2829
01:23:10,300 --> 01:23:10,990
which is,

2830
01:23:10,990 --> 01:23:12,600
I don't even want to talk about
what that does to your health.

2831
01:23:12,601 --> 01:23:12,980
Bad.

2832
01:23:12,980 --> 01:23:13,140
Yeah,

2833
01:23:13,140 --> 01:23:13,630
it's bad.

2834
01:23:13,630 --> 01:23:14,350
God dammit.

2835
01:23:14,350 --> 01:23:16,780
So fucking Kale chips are bad.

2836
01:23:16,880 --> 01:23:18,880
Nosy Kale chips don't have to be bad.

2837
01:23:18,881 --> 01:23:20,220
It's just what they
used to make him cheesy.

2838
01:23:20,370 --> 01:23:21,700
[inaudible] motherfuckers so cheesy.

2839
01:23:21,701 --> 01:23:22,600
Kale chips or bad.

2840
01:23:22,720 --> 01:23:24,670
If they're using vinegar
to make the cheesy flavor,

2841
01:23:24,671 --> 01:23:25,151
they're fine,

2842
01:23:25,151 --> 01:23:25,631
but most of them,

2843
01:23:25,631 --> 01:23:28,600
they use nutritional yeast
and they see what I could.

2844
01:23:28,630 --> 01:23:33,040
I have so many studies about how come
I knew they tasted too fucking good.

2845
01:23:33,580 --> 01:23:33,821
Yeah,

2846
01:23:33,821 --> 01:23:34,520
I knew it while,

2847
01:23:34,520 --> 01:23:35,200
sorry man.

2848
01:23:35,200 --> 01:23:37,530
These cheesy Kale chips are wonderful.

2849
01:23:37,531 --> 01:23:39,070
Why do you think they're so
addictive and you're like,

2850
01:23:39,100 --> 01:23:39,510
ah,

2851
01:23:39,510 --> 01:23:40,090
yeah,

2852
01:23:40,090 --> 01:23:43,690
you fucking God dammit Vegan people.

2853
01:23:43,720 --> 01:23:44,553
How dare you?

2854
01:23:44,980 --> 01:23:47,590
How dare you get me to eat
your shit that's bad for you,

2855
01:23:47,620 --> 01:23:48,580
but yet delicious.

2856
01:23:48,610 --> 01:23:50,980
There's going to be a huge storm on
Twitter about people saying nutritional

2857
01:23:50,981 --> 01:23:51,970
yeast has B vitamins.

2858
01:23:51,971 --> 01:23:52,301
And I'm like,

2859
01:23:52,301 --> 01:23:52,601
yeah,

2860
01:23:52,601 --> 01:23:53,290
and look at the,

2861
01:23:53,290 --> 01:23:56,890
just go to pub med and Google cancer
and nutritional yeast and see what you

2862
01:23:56,891 --> 01:23:57,724
find.

2863
01:23:57,880 --> 01:23:59,390
So the cheese is not a cheap,

2864
01:24:00,170 --> 01:24:02,080
it's actually a clump of organisms.

2865
01:24:02,110 --> 01:24:03,160
That's what the yeast is.

2866
01:24:03,220 --> 01:24:03,460
Yup.

2867
01:24:03,460 --> 01:24:04,030
It's like a,

2868
01:24:04,030 --> 01:24:05,350
it's like bakers and brewer's yeast.

2869
01:24:05,351 --> 01:24:05,590
Yeah.

2870
01:24:05,590 --> 01:24:06,370
Wow.

2871
01:24:06,370 --> 01:24:08,020
And then how they make it like a cheese,

2872
01:24:08,021 --> 01:24:08,470
they just,

2873
01:24:08,470 --> 01:24:10,630
well you actually kind of has
a cheesy flavor on its own.

2874
01:24:10,631 --> 01:24:12,530
So they take that and they
mix it with some other,

2875
01:24:12,560 --> 01:24:13,361
usually like a nut,

2876
01:24:13,361 --> 01:24:14,230
like a ricotta,

2877
01:24:14,260 --> 01:24:16,060
like or like a Vegan ricotta thing.

2878
01:24:16,210 --> 01:24:16,901
I mean I've been like,

2879
01:24:16,901 --> 01:24:17,290
uh,

2880
01:24:17,290 --> 01:24:20,690
I still eat a lot of like vegan dishes
just under the weird soy and crap.

2881
01:24:20,700 --> 01:24:23,800
Like if it's made out of raw vegetables
chopped up finally with enough good fat

2882
01:24:23,801 --> 01:24:24,011
in them,

2883
01:24:24,011 --> 01:24:26,380
like Avocados and some of
the healthier food out there.

2884
01:24:26,740 --> 01:24:27,190
Right.

2885
01:24:27,190 --> 01:24:28,540
So I'm,

2886
01:24:28,610 --> 01:24:30,190
I'm a pretty good in the kitchen,

2887
01:24:30,191 --> 01:24:31,090
like with raw food.

2888
01:24:31,120 --> 01:24:33,490
And the problem is you add
nutritional yeast to it,

2889
01:24:33,610 --> 01:24:34,930
it makes it inflammatory.

2890
01:24:34,931 --> 01:24:35,960
It's just not very good for him.

2891
01:24:35,970 --> 01:24:37,510
So that's just those kale chips.

2892
01:24:37,511 --> 01:24:38,750
You can get the regular Kale chips,

2893
01:24:38,840 --> 01:24:41,200
but that aren't quite
as God damn delicious.

2894
01:24:41,260 --> 01:24:42,970
I'm sorry Joe Mother fuckers.

2895
01:24:42,971 --> 01:24:43,571
I knew,

2896
01:24:43,571 --> 01:24:48,160
I knew it couldn't have possibly
die from cheesy Kale chips.

2897
01:24:48,260 --> 01:24:53,260
You're not concentrating on the
time maximizing your potential.

2898
01:24:54,340 --> 01:24:56,080
That's why I think this
is so far on the spectrum,

2899
01:24:56,081 --> 01:24:56,261
like,

2900
01:24:56,261 --> 01:24:56,830
okay,

2901
01:24:56,830 --> 01:24:59,920
if you ate cheesy Kale chips every day
for the rest of your life compared to

2902
01:24:59,921 --> 01:25:00,570
potato chips,

2903
01:25:00,570 --> 01:25:00,791
you,

2904
01:25:00,791 --> 01:25:01,870
you fucking rocked it.

2905
01:25:02,290 --> 01:25:02,890
Okay.

2906
01:25:02,890 --> 01:25:05,260
That's why everything on the
bulletproof diet is a spectrum.

2907
01:25:05,261 --> 01:25:06,460
It's like this is better than this,

2908
01:25:06,461 --> 01:25:07,780
but like this is a lot better than this,

2909
01:25:07,930 --> 01:25:09,220
so you don't have to be perfect.

2910
01:25:09,250 --> 01:25:09,611
If you,

2911
01:25:09,611 --> 01:25:09,781
you know,

2912
01:25:09,781 --> 01:25:12,130
if you want to identify a
goalpost for perfection,

2913
01:25:12,131 --> 01:25:14,680
just kind of move in that direction
and you'll be way better off.

2914
01:25:15,250 --> 01:25:17,710
And most people fail in their
diets because they feel like,

2915
01:25:17,740 --> 01:25:18,051
oh I,

2916
01:25:18,051 --> 01:25:19,030
I did it wrong.

2917
01:25:19,031 --> 01:25:19,691
Now I lose.

2918
01:25:19,691 --> 01:25:19,901
I'm like,

2919
01:25:19,901 --> 01:25:20,501
you didn't do it wrong.

2920
01:25:20,501 --> 01:25:21,580
You could have done a lot worse.

2921
01:25:21,640 --> 01:25:22,510
You could have done it better,

2922
01:25:22,690 --> 01:25:24,040
but like you're somewhere in the middle.

2923
01:25:24,190 --> 01:25:25,390
And the truth of the matter is,

2924
01:25:25,391 --> 01:25:26,530
I'm always in the middle too.

2925
01:25:26,860 --> 01:25:27,131
Like,

2926
01:25:27,131 --> 01:25:27,401
okay,

2927
01:25:27,401 --> 01:25:28,780
I had a grass fed cow but you know,

2928
01:25:28,781 --> 01:25:30,170
was it slaughtered by you know,

2929
01:25:30,220 --> 01:25:31,180
an ordained minister.

2930
01:25:31,181 --> 01:25:32,110
I fail if I know,

2931
01:25:32,440 --> 01:25:32,891
but like,

2932
01:25:32,891 --> 01:25:35,130
like there's probably some way of
making it slightly more perfect.

2933
01:25:35,190 --> 01:25:36,370
It wasn't massage every day.

2934
01:25:36,500 --> 01:25:38,260
I wouldn't want a minister to kill my cow.

2935
01:25:38,320 --> 01:25:39,820
I don't know if I went to dummy.

2936
01:25:39,850 --> 01:25:42,310
I actually tend to lose
count agree with you.

2937
01:25:42,311 --> 01:25:44,900
Like I don't know if I don't
like how blessed by the church,

2938
01:25:45,310 --> 01:25:46,600
bless it before you eat it,

2939
01:25:46,690 --> 01:25:49,270
but there has to be like some bizarre
thing you could do that's better.

2940
01:25:49,271 --> 01:25:49,961
Like then again,

2941
01:25:49,961 --> 01:25:52,150
if someone really
believed in the blessing,

2942
01:25:52,180 --> 01:25:55,210
maybe they would impart some
sort of an energy into the thing.

2943
01:25:55,330 --> 01:25:56,170
That sounds ridiculous.

2944
01:25:56,171 --> 01:25:59,860
But what we were talking about before
about people literally having some sort of

2945
01:25:59,861 --> 01:26:01,120
an environmental effect,

2946
01:26:01,121 --> 01:26:03,170
some sort of an effect on
all the people around them.

2947
01:26:03,470 --> 01:26:03,801
How these,

2948
01:26:03,801 --> 01:26:03,970
look,

2949
01:26:03,970 --> 01:26:04,080
you

2950
01:26:04,080 --> 01:26:05,630
don't want some asshole killing your cow.

2951
01:26:05,910 --> 01:26:06,860
I'll tell you flat out,

2952
01:26:06,890 --> 01:26:09,460
I do not want a cow that was
tortured before it was ill.

2953
01:26:09,650 --> 01:26:10,760
It changes the hormones at all?

2954
01:26:10,761 --> 01:26:13,220
I think it changes the taste and
there's an energy thing there.

2955
01:26:13,221 --> 01:26:13,431
I mean,

2956
01:26:13,431 --> 01:26:14,990
call me a psycho hippie or whatever,

2957
01:26:14,991 --> 01:26:17,810
but I've done a lot of
intuitive like training of my,

2958
01:26:17,870 --> 01:26:18,650
my,

2959
01:26:18,650 --> 01:26:22,820
my heart and of other parts of my
body with electronics and like,

2960
01:26:22,850 --> 01:26:23,330
I dunno,

2961
01:26:23,330 --> 01:26:24,860
there's something not right about like,

2962
01:26:24,890 --> 01:26:25,010
you know,

2963
01:26:25,010 --> 01:26:26,180
some statistic asshole,

2964
01:26:26,210 --> 01:26:26,451
you know,

2965
01:26:26,451 --> 01:26:27,171
torturing your cow,

2966
01:26:27,171 --> 01:26:28,250
killing it and then feeding it to you.

2967
01:26:28,251 --> 01:26:29,480
Like it's face,

2968
01:26:29,481 --> 01:26:30,020
it's wrong.

2969
01:26:30,020 --> 01:26:30,741
Well it is.

2970
01:26:30,741 --> 01:26:33,050
And have you ever seen the
way they do kosher cows?

2971
01:26:33,070 --> 01:26:33,260
Oh,

2972
01:26:33,260 --> 01:26:33,841
it's brutal.

2973
01:26:33,841 --> 01:26:34,930
It's those machines then.

2974
01:26:35,330 --> 01:26:35,870
It's crazy.

2975
01:26:35,870 --> 01:26:36,260
Well,

2976
01:26:36,260 --> 01:26:37,640
it's supposed to be done by a rabbi.

2977
01:26:37,670 --> 01:26:38,750
It's supposed to be done by a rabbi.

2978
01:26:38,751 --> 01:26:40,490
Rabbi supposed to slice
the neck of the cow,

2979
01:26:40,670 --> 01:26:41,191
but you're,

2980
01:26:41,191 --> 01:26:42,410
you're supposed to do it that way.

2981
01:26:42,410 --> 01:26:43,360
That's how he killed a cow.

2982
01:26:43,370 --> 01:26:46,430
You slice his neck and it takes a while
for him to die and it's not fucking

2983
01:26:46,431 --> 01:26:46,761
pretty.

2984
01:26:46,761 --> 01:26:49,700
And there's videos of them trying to get
up and falling down and trying to get

2985
01:26:49,701 --> 01:26:49,881
up.

2986
01:26:49,881 --> 01:26:51,350
And you should see the kosher machines.

2987
01:26:51,380 --> 01:26:54,110
They do have kosher
machine as long as it's,

2988
01:26:54,111 --> 01:26:54,944
as long as it lasts,

2989
01:26:55,010 --> 01:26:56,330
as long as it's been blessed.

2990
01:26:56,331 --> 01:26:57,350
That gets approved for kosher,

2991
01:26:57,351 --> 01:26:58,910
but it's even worse because it's like,

2992
01:26:58,911 --> 01:27:02,820
like the cows go in and they just like
rip their throat out with like a raw and

2993
01:27:02,821 --> 01:27:03,170
it's,

2994
01:27:03,170 --> 01:27:05,150
it's one of the things
where people think that,

2995
01:27:05,180 --> 01:27:05,331
oh,

2996
01:27:05,331 --> 01:27:05,481
you know,

2997
01:27:05,481 --> 01:27:06,500
Dave is the opposite of Vegan.

2998
01:27:06,501 --> 01:27:06,711
I'm like,

2999
01:27:06,711 --> 01:27:07,190
no,

3000
01:27:07,190 --> 01:27:10,760
I care a lot about the quality of the
animals I eat and the quality of the food

3001
01:27:10,761 --> 01:27:11,390
I eat.

3002
01:27:11,390 --> 01:27:14,180
But I also care about the quality of
my life and wanting to do with it.

3003
01:27:14,180 --> 01:27:17,360
And if I'm slowing myself down
by eating inappropriate foods.

3004
01:27:17,780 --> 01:27:19,480
There's also another thing
we've got to talk about,

3005
01:27:19,490 --> 01:27:20,450
talking about animal suffering.

3006
01:27:20,990 --> 01:27:21,823
I'm in Tibet,

3007
01:27:21,840 --> 01:27:22,071
right?

3008
01:27:22,071 --> 01:27:23,480
I spend like a couple months,

3009
01:27:23,481 --> 01:27:27,770
actually three months walking around
Asia visiting monasteries and stuff and I

3010
01:27:27,771 --> 01:27:28,341
went to this monster.

3011
01:27:28,341 --> 01:27:31,830
I had the Vegan vegetarian diet for um,

3012
01:27:31,950 --> 01:27:33,440
she was Vegan for like 10 days.

3013
01:27:33,550 --> 01:27:35,060
I'm farting like a machine the whole time.

3014
01:27:35,510 --> 01:27:39,590
And then afterwards they go to another
monastery in Lhasa and there's this giant

3015
01:27:39,591 --> 01:27:43,370
Yak skin on the prayer pole in
the middle of the monastery.

3016
01:27:43,550 --> 01:27:45,150
And so I asked the head Lama Guy,

3017
01:27:45,151 --> 01:27:45,650
and I said,

3018
01:27:45,650 --> 01:27:46,483
okay,

3019
01:27:46,810 --> 01:27:47,960
like you're a hypocrite.

3020
01:27:48,260 --> 01:27:49,270
Like you'd say,

3021
01:27:49,280 --> 01:27:49,851
no killing,

3022
01:27:49,851 --> 01:27:51,620
and you've got a dead animal
hanging on your prayer pole,

3023
01:27:51,621 --> 01:27:52,490
like what's the deal?

3024
01:27:52,790 --> 01:27:53,820
And he just looked at me and he,

3025
01:27:53,850 --> 01:27:54,051
you know,

3026
01:27:54,051 --> 01:27:55,780
the way like Buddhist monks kind of do,

3027
01:27:55,781 --> 01:27:56,960
we just kind of laughed and he said,

3028
01:27:57,350 --> 01:27:57,800
oh,

3029
01:27:57,800 --> 01:27:58,970
one death feeds everyone.

3030
01:27:59,780 --> 01:28:00,613
And then you walked away.

3031
01:28:00,650 --> 01:28:01,580
Like that was his whole thing.

3032
01:28:01,790 --> 01:28:02,660
And I thought about that.

3033
01:28:02,960 --> 01:28:06,650
If I eat two pounds of grass
fed beef every day for a year,

3034
01:28:06,800 --> 01:28:09,860
I killed 0.7 animals in
the entire food chain.

3035
01:28:10,580 --> 01:28:13,250
If I'm Vegan and I eat soy nuggets,

3036
01:28:13,280 --> 01:28:17,840
every bowl of soy nuggets is killing
hundreds of animals because the tractor

3037
01:28:17,841 --> 01:28:19,130
goes through and cuts down the soil.

3038
01:28:19,220 --> 01:28:19,970
The soil,

3039
01:28:19,970 --> 01:28:20,170
not,

3040
01:28:20,170 --> 01:28:22,010
we're not even talking about
what it did to the soil microbes,

3041
01:28:22,370 --> 01:28:23,540
but it cuts down all the soil.

3042
01:28:23,690 --> 01:28:26,420
It chops up the bunnies and their
cute little faces and the turtles.

3043
01:28:26,421 --> 01:28:30,290
And the grasshoppers and the worms and
all the other stuff there and basically

3044
01:28:30,590 --> 01:28:33,290
you look at the number of animals
killed to bring you a bowl of grain.

3045
01:28:33,291 --> 01:28:35,510
It's way in excess of
what grass fed beef does.

3046
01:28:35,990 --> 01:28:37,190
The vegan argument is,

3047
01:28:37,191 --> 01:28:38,930
well there's enough grass fed
beef for everyone and I'm like,

3048
01:28:38,931 --> 01:28:39,081
yeah,

3049
01:28:39,081 --> 01:28:40,280
that's because people don't ask for it.

3050
01:28:40,280 --> 01:28:40,791
You asked for it.

3051
01:28:40,791 --> 01:28:44,690
We'll turn the golf courses into basically
grass fed beef manufacturing plants.

3052
01:28:44,990 --> 01:28:46,400
There's plenty of them
out there to do that.

3053
01:28:46,401 --> 01:28:46,771
By the way,

3054
01:28:46,771 --> 01:28:47,960
like there's people who've done the math.

3055
01:28:48,030 --> 01:28:48,960
It would be a B,

3056
01:28:48,961 --> 01:28:50,540
it would be a smaller cow.

3057
01:28:50,570 --> 01:28:53,150
You wouldn't have nearly as much
fat and the taste is different.

3058
01:28:53,170 --> 01:28:56,090
The taste is different and this is
Rogan doesn't like the grass fed beef.

3059
01:28:56,091 --> 01:28:57,850
I try to cook the grass fit man.

3060
01:28:57,970 --> 01:28:58,550
Taste tea.

3061
01:28:58,550 --> 01:29:03,550
Can we just say this podcast is grass
fed now by how many grass fed is in it?

3062
01:29:03,641 --> 01:29:03,730
Yeah,

3063
01:29:03,730 --> 01:29:04,563
it just matters.

3064
01:29:04,740 --> 01:29:05,520
It's stamped.

3065
01:29:05,520 --> 01:29:06,960
I would eat a bowl of gravel if,

3066
01:29:07,050 --> 01:29:07,861
if I could perform.

3067
01:29:07,861 --> 01:29:09,780
I want it like I have
real dogma about this.

3068
01:29:09,781 --> 01:29:09,931
Like,

3069
01:29:09,931 --> 01:29:10,290
I don't,

3070
01:29:10,290 --> 01:29:11,370
I don't care like food.

3071
01:29:11,371 --> 01:29:13,530
For me it's like optimal
fuel for human potential.

3072
01:29:13,590 --> 01:29:14,100
That's it.

3073
01:29:14,100 --> 01:29:15,240
Not just delicious as well.

3074
01:29:15,270 --> 01:29:15,451
I mean,

3075
01:29:15,451 --> 01:29:16,380
I love the deliciousness.

3076
01:29:16,381 --> 01:29:17,730
I have a cookbook out for God's sake.

3077
01:29:17,760 --> 01:29:18,530
Oh deal.

3078
01:29:18,530 --> 01:29:19,740
It's called the upgraded chef.

3079
01:29:19,890 --> 01:29:22,650
It's like how do you cook stuff fast
to produce the least toxins that you

3080
01:29:22,651 --> 01:29:23,484
perform better on it.

3081
01:29:24,290 --> 01:29:25,170
This is so fast.

3082
01:29:25,171 --> 01:29:26,930
And it was this a long journey for you?

3083
01:29:27,810 --> 01:29:28,051
Yeah,

3084
01:29:28,051 --> 01:29:28,920
for 15 years.

3085
01:29:28,921 --> 01:29:31,920
I mean I spend a quarter million dollars
upgrading myself and I started like

3086
01:29:31,921 --> 01:29:35,820
tracking how I felt and how
I was performing and was I
gaining weight or losing

3087
01:29:35,821 --> 01:29:38,220
weight and did my joints
hurt and all this stuff.

3088
01:29:38,460 --> 01:29:43,460
And I came to this conclusion that you
can't change one variable and expect

3089
01:29:43,771 --> 01:29:44,221
something to work.

3090
01:29:44,221 --> 01:29:47,160
You've got to change a lot of variables
at once and then start adding things

3091
01:29:47,161 --> 01:29:47,790
back in.

3092
01:29:47,790 --> 01:29:50,340
Because let's say you're allergic
to just like milk and wheat,

3093
01:29:50,341 --> 01:29:51,360
which so many people are,

3094
01:29:51,900 --> 01:29:53,040
oh this week I'll no wheat,

3095
01:29:53,070 --> 01:29:55,320
nothing changed this
week I'll eat no dairy,

3096
01:29:55,321 --> 01:29:55,870
nothing changed.

3097
01:29:55,870 --> 01:29:56,910
So you assume nothing happened.

3098
01:29:57,060 --> 01:30:00,690
The problem is there's many things
that cause inflammation at its core.

3099
01:30:00,691 --> 01:30:02,700
The bulletproof diet is
about reducing inflammation.

3100
01:30:03,000 --> 01:30:03,930
And here's the secret.

3101
01:30:04,620 --> 01:30:05,610
When you look at a food,

3102
01:30:05,640 --> 01:30:07,590
there's three ways of looking at it.

3103
01:30:07,920 --> 01:30:11,240
The first one is does it have
the right macronutrients?

3104
01:30:11,390 --> 01:30:13,740
So like if I needed to eat some
protein or I need to eat some,

3105
01:30:14,100 --> 01:30:14,933
some fat,

3106
01:30:15,000 --> 01:30:15,870
is it in there?

3107
01:30:16,110 --> 01:30:17,400
But here's the funny thing,

3108
01:30:17,401 --> 01:30:18,720
people don't think about it so much.

3109
01:30:18,780 --> 01:30:19,030
You know,

3110
01:30:19,030 --> 01:30:19,680
if we said,

3111
01:30:19,680 --> 01:30:19,861
look,

3112
01:30:19,861 --> 01:30:21,690
you need to get 200
grams of protein today,

3113
01:30:21,960 --> 01:30:22,591
we generally say,

3114
01:30:22,591 --> 01:30:22,860
yeah,

3115
01:30:22,860 --> 01:30:23,693
that's good,

3116
01:30:23,700 --> 01:30:24,870
but wait a minute.

3117
01:30:24,960 --> 01:30:25,290
Okay,

3118
01:30:25,290 --> 01:30:29,370
this little vial of protein is the act
of protein that's in black widow spider

3119
01:30:29,371 --> 01:30:29,820
venom.

3120
01:30:29,820 --> 01:30:30,750
And this is an egg,

3121
01:30:30,930 --> 01:30:31,081
okay?

3122
01:30:31,081 --> 01:30:32,460
How many grams of protein
you want to eat today?

3123
01:30:33,170 --> 01:30:33,670
Okay?

3124
01:30:33,670 --> 01:30:36,480
The bottom line is different proteins
do different things to your body.

3125
01:30:36,690 --> 01:30:38,400
So you've got to pick the
right protein in there.

3126
01:30:38,790 --> 01:30:39,600
And then the fats.

3127
01:30:39,600 --> 01:30:43,230
Do you want hydrogenated vegetable
oil or do you want coconut oil?

3128
01:30:43,260 --> 01:30:45,210
They're totally different on
what they do to your body.

3129
01:30:45,630 --> 01:30:47,370
So first you got to get those sorted out.

3130
01:30:47,640 --> 01:30:50,410
And then the second way you look at
your food is something called anti

3131
01:30:50,411 --> 01:30:51,244
nutrients.

3132
01:30:51,300 --> 01:30:53,940
And this is something that that most
modern nutritionist just don't pay

3133
01:30:53,941 --> 01:30:54,481
attention to.

3134
01:30:54,481 --> 01:30:56,550
Paleo people know about
some but not others.

3135
01:30:57,060 --> 01:31:00,690
And what's going on there is food
has a defense mechanism built in.

3136
01:31:00,691 --> 01:31:01,524
If you're a grain,

3137
01:31:01,830 --> 01:31:05,190
your job was to reproduce and that means
you coat yourself in pesticide to keep

3138
01:31:05,191 --> 01:31:06,960
the bugs from eating your
so you can reproduce.

3139
01:31:07,020 --> 01:31:10,920
It's natural pesticide is
called [inaudible] acid and
it inhibits whatever eats

3140
01:31:10,921 --> 01:31:13,830
you and inhibits their ability to
absorb minerals from their food.

3141
01:31:14,340 --> 01:31:16,530
So now what would I do
when I look at food?

3142
01:31:16,530 --> 01:31:17,960
Does it have the right macronutrients?

3143
01:31:17,990 --> 01:31:19,260
Doesn't have poison in it?

3144
01:31:19,470 --> 01:31:20,100
If so,

3145
01:31:20,100 --> 01:31:21,000
then I don't want to eat it.

3146
01:31:21,120 --> 01:31:21,511
And finally,

3147
01:31:21,511 --> 01:31:25,290
does it have a lot of other stuff like
B vitamins and minerals and the other

3148
01:31:25,291 --> 01:31:28,140
micronutrients you had
guys like this Andy Guy,

3149
01:31:28,170 --> 01:31:31,350
that aggregate nutrient index
guy at whole foods Ferman,

3150
01:31:32,370 --> 01:31:33,630
who by the way thinks Kales,

3151
01:31:33,631 --> 01:31:33,871
you know,

3152
01:31:33,871 --> 01:31:37,470
basically next to god he puts liver
like at a very low number on there.

3153
01:31:37,620 --> 01:31:41,400
Yet liver has a lot more
nutrients in it than Kale does.

3154
01:31:41,730 --> 01:31:45,480
The problem is he decided to divide
by calories for reasons I don't quite

3155
01:31:45,481 --> 01:31:46,950
understand what's going on.

3156
01:31:46,951 --> 01:31:48,770
There is a focus on micronutrients,

3157
01:31:48,810 --> 01:31:53,010
ignoring anti nutrients and ignoring
the function of food is fuel and they're

3158
01:31:53,011 --> 01:31:55,980
also doing that because they have
a pro animal sort of an agenda.

3159
01:31:56,070 --> 01:31:56,341
Oh yeah.

3160
01:31:56,341 --> 01:31:57,690
There's definitely agenda behind that.

3161
01:31:57,720 --> 01:31:58,351
There's a lot of people,

3162
01:31:58,351 --> 01:32:00,580
like I've had conversations
with people who are vegans

3163
01:32:00,700 --> 01:32:04,120
and they will tell you that it's only
for health purposes and then I bring up

3164
01:32:04,121 --> 01:32:05,650
fish oil and most of them,

3165
01:32:05,860 --> 01:32:08,240
they don't take fish oil and I say,

3166
01:32:08,241 --> 01:32:08,411
well,

3167
01:32:08,411 --> 01:32:09,070
why?

3168
01:32:09,070 --> 01:32:10,390
If it's just for health reasons,

3169
01:32:10,391 --> 01:32:12,100
fish oil has been shown to be very,

3170
01:32:12,101 --> 01:32:13,030
very beneficial,

3171
01:32:13,510 --> 01:32:14,770
but it gets squirrely.

3172
01:32:14,771 --> 01:32:16,780
They start talking about
eating flax seeds and shit.

3173
01:32:16,910 --> 01:32:18,760
You know if you're
going to eat flax seeds,

3174
01:32:18,820 --> 01:32:21,520
flax seed oil oxidizes
the second at Cs air,

3175
01:32:21,521 --> 01:32:23,080
like it's an incredibly unstable,

3176
01:32:23,110 --> 01:32:24,340
even in Ayurvedic Medicine,

3177
01:32:24,490 --> 01:32:24,970
they tell you,

3178
01:32:24,970 --> 01:32:28,870
you know flaxseed oil is a drying oil
and your body can convert that to the

3179
01:32:28,871 --> 01:32:32,340
healthy Omega threes out a ratio of 40
to one you'll be 40 grams of flax oil.

3180
01:32:32,341 --> 01:32:35,710
You get one gram of the good stuff and
you've got to dispose of the other 39

3181
01:32:35,711 --> 01:32:37,300
grams that cause inflammation in the body.

3182
01:32:37,450 --> 01:32:38,050
Whoa.

3183
01:32:38,050 --> 01:32:38,380
Yeah.

3184
01:32:38,380 --> 01:32:41,260
That's why I don't recommend
flips on its between fish oil.

3185
01:32:41,490 --> 01:32:44,860
It actually counteracts that
and the fights inflammation,

3186
01:32:44,890 --> 01:32:46,690
which is why it's so great for grapplers.

3187
01:32:47,020 --> 01:32:47,141
Oh,

3188
01:32:47,141 --> 01:32:47,711
it's huge.

3189
01:32:47,711 --> 01:32:48,280
Yeah.

3190
01:32:48,280 --> 01:32:49,113
Yeah.

3191
01:32:49,280 --> 01:32:54,280
Guys are always in a lot of guys who are
into crossfit as well and heavy doses

3192
01:32:54,791 --> 01:32:55,550
of fish oil.

3193
01:32:55,550 --> 01:32:55,681
Yeah.

3194
01:32:55,681 --> 01:32:56,840
It's an anti inflammatory,

3195
01:32:56,870 --> 01:32:57,110
right?

3196
01:32:57,110 --> 01:32:58,120
It's good stuff,

3197
01:32:58,270 --> 01:32:58,841
but I tell you,

3198
01:32:58,841 --> 01:32:59,500
if you use Krill,

3199
01:32:59,500 --> 01:33:02,920
it's going to work better because
Krill has the same EPA and Dha,

3200
01:33:02,921 --> 01:33:03,910
but its phosphorolated.

3201
01:33:03,911 --> 01:33:05,200
It's bound to phospholipids,

3202
01:33:05,201 --> 01:33:06,940
which means that your
brain can use it directly.

3203
01:33:07,390 --> 01:33:07,731
Fish oil.

3204
01:33:07,731 --> 01:33:09,540
It's gotta be phosphorolated and he's you.

3205
01:33:09,550 --> 01:33:10,720
You need to get extra phosphate.

3206
01:33:10,721 --> 01:33:11,231
I was searing,

3207
01:33:11,231 --> 01:33:12,850
I'm calling to do that in your diet.

3208
01:33:13,060 --> 01:33:14,620
So you have to take Coleen supplements.

3209
01:33:14,621 --> 01:33:16,180
If you take fish oil to get the October,

3210
01:33:16,310 --> 01:33:18,640
maybe just eat eggs except Coleen.

3211
01:33:18,670 --> 01:33:19,120
Yeah,

3212
01:33:19,120 --> 01:33:20,200
because here's the thing,

3213
01:33:20,260 --> 01:33:22,480
some of the like super
strong coding supplements,

3214
01:33:22,720 --> 01:33:26,680
like if there's no question they have
a really beneficial effect in like most

3215
01:33:26,681 --> 01:33:28,810
people in some people too much.

3216
01:33:28,810 --> 01:33:32,860
Coleen has like a reverse effect and it's
probably like maybe a third of people.

3217
01:33:33,340 --> 01:33:35,950
So it is one of those things
where if you get it in your food,

3218
01:33:35,951 --> 01:33:36,700
you're good.

3219
01:33:36,700 --> 01:33:38,920
And if the calling supplements
make you feel really good,

3220
01:33:38,921 --> 01:33:40,210
which they do for the
vast majority people,

3221
01:33:40,230 --> 01:33:42,220
like I'm a fan of Coleen
supplements in general,

3222
01:33:42,221 --> 01:33:43,300
I recommend them on the blog.

3223
01:33:43,301 --> 01:33:47,380
Like you've got that ingredient
in Alpha Beta and Alpha brain.

3224
01:33:47,500 --> 01:33:47,920
And like,

3225
01:33:47,920 --> 01:33:48,401
by the way,

3226
01:33:48,401 --> 01:33:50,440
that's just a killer list
of nootropic ingredients.

3227
01:33:50,441 --> 01:33:50,770
I,

3228
01:33:50,770 --> 01:33:51,640
I fully,

3229
01:33:51,760 --> 01:33:54,430
fully approved that bulletproof
level supplement for sure.

3230
01:33:54,490 --> 01:33:54,821
Awesome.

3231
01:33:54,821 --> 01:33:55,420
Thank you.

3232
01:33:55,420 --> 01:33:57,180
And uh,

3233
01:33:57,210 --> 01:33:57,500
the,

3234
01:33:57,500 --> 01:33:58,151
the thing is though,

3235
01:33:58,151 --> 01:33:59,950
if you're one of those
Coleen sensitive people,

3236
01:33:59,951 --> 01:34:01,570
you might not want a ton of Coleen.

3237
01:34:01,600 --> 01:34:03,850
Like you want to limit
yourself to a certain amount.

3238
01:34:03,990 --> 01:34:06,730
We've had issues with that with
people getting really sensitive,

3239
01:34:07,120 --> 01:34:08,500
like draw attention and headaches.

3240
01:34:08,560 --> 01:34:09,040
Yeah,

3241
01:34:09,040 --> 01:34:09,311
yeah.

3242
01:34:09,311 --> 01:34:10,870
And those are the people
who are calling dominant.

3243
01:34:11,080 --> 01:34:11,913
But here's the kicker.

3244
01:34:11,920 --> 01:34:13,530
You get those people to take antiacid Tam,

3245
01:34:13,560 --> 01:34:17,320
like the stuff I've got in my site
and our acid tam uses up extra Coleen.

3246
01:34:17,710 --> 01:34:20,200
So that's an interesting
way of using a smart drug.

3247
01:34:20,201 --> 01:34:21,070
And this is actually a drug,

3248
01:34:21,071 --> 01:34:21,520
not a,

3249
01:34:21,520 --> 01:34:23,170
not a natural substance,

3250
01:34:23,350 --> 01:34:25,210
but it's one that I'll bring
your colon levels down,

3251
01:34:25,211 --> 01:34:27,190
which means you can benefit
from the other stuff that's in,

3252
01:34:27,470 --> 01:34:27,820
um,

3253
01:34:27,820 --> 01:34:28,480
Alpha brain.

3254
01:34:28,480 --> 01:34:31,570
But you also get this boost from
the other type of nootropic.

3255
01:34:32,140 --> 01:34:33,640
How many different
things do you take a day?

3256
01:34:34,160 --> 01:34:34,510
Uh,

3257
01:34:34,510 --> 01:34:37,180
I take probably on an
average day about 40 pills.

3258
01:34:39,190 --> 01:34:39,401
See,

3259
01:34:39,401 --> 01:34:40,630
I told you I'm not crazy.

3260
01:34:40,830 --> 01:34:41,663
I know.

3261
01:34:41,680 --> 01:34:42,001
Here's,

3262
01:34:42,001 --> 01:34:42,701
here's a crazy number.

3263
01:34:42,701 --> 01:34:44,230
When I was really focused on like,

3264
01:34:44,250 --> 01:34:47,830
like getting my health all the way where
I wanted it before I was all the way.

3265
01:34:47,890 --> 01:34:51,040
Where am I did a 187 pills
a day for several months.

3266
01:34:51,190 --> 01:34:51,371
Now.

3267
01:34:51,371 --> 01:34:53,560
What about the actual capsule itself?

3268
01:34:53,561 --> 01:34:54,940
What are those made out of gelatin?

3269
01:34:54,970 --> 01:34:56,080
Is that no big deal for your body,

3270
01:34:56,090 --> 01:34:59,660
the process you actually need gelatin
our diets or gelatin deficient right now.

3271
01:34:59,750 --> 01:35:00,230
Oh really?

3272
01:35:00,230 --> 01:35:00,650
Yeah.

3273
01:35:00,650 --> 01:35:01,101
And you know,

3274
01:35:01,101 --> 01:35:02,330
we eat all the muscles in the animal,

3275
01:35:02,331 --> 01:35:05,870
but in the old days or mom would boil
the chicken and eat all the cartilage and

3276
01:35:05,871 --> 01:35:06,650
all that.

3277
01:35:06,650 --> 01:35:11,650
So I actually carry gelatin and Collagen
on the site because when people eat

3278
01:35:12,141 --> 01:35:12,591
that stuff,

3279
01:35:12,591 --> 01:35:13,790
their joints get healthier.

3280
01:35:14,180 --> 01:35:17,450
And there's another thing and this whole
electrical part of the body is not well

3281
01:35:17,451 --> 01:35:17,751
known,

3282
01:35:17,751 --> 01:35:20,990
but you know all those acupuncture
Meridian points and things like that.

3283
01:35:21,590 --> 01:35:22,040
Well,

3284
01:35:22,040 --> 01:35:23,990
electricity flows through your skin,

3285
01:35:24,020 --> 01:35:28,480
not just in your nerves and you need
collagen in your skin in order to,

3286
01:35:28,481 --> 01:35:31,460
to bring the water into the skin so
you can carry electricity efficiently.

3287
01:35:31,670 --> 01:35:34,010
So when you eat enough collagen
in the form of gelatin,

3288
01:35:34,250 --> 01:35:35,061
knocks blocks,

3289
01:35:35,061 --> 01:35:35,894
whatever,

3290
01:35:36,050 --> 01:35:37,610
I have grass fed gelatin that I use.

3291
01:35:38,020 --> 01:35:38,480
Whoa.

3292
01:35:38,480 --> 01:35:39,980
But you do that.

3293
01:35:40,010 --> 01:35:40,670
You actually,

3294
01:35:40,670 --> 01:35:42,170
you functioned better on many levels,

3295
01:35:42,171 --> 01:35:43,520
including on the inflammation level.

3296
01:35:44,030 --> 01:35:46,250
A lot of fighters are
starting to take Jello.

3297
01:35:46,300 --> 01:35:48,500
And I noticed it in,

3298
01:35:48,700 --> 01:35:49,311
they did this,

3299
01:35:49,311 --> 01:35:52,370
I'm like sort of cribs
thing with Minotauro.

3300
01:35:52,371 --> 01:35:53,121
Nogueira go.

3301
01:35:53,121 --> 01:35:56,270
Just fought a recently in UFC this past
weekend and they went to his house.

3302
01:35:56,271 --> 01:35:57,530
He had a stack of Jello,

3303
01:35:58,890 --> 01:35:59,511
said he had,

3304
01:35:59,511 --> 01:36:00,830
this is make me feel good.

3305
01:36:01,240 --> 01:36:03,290
I mean it works even for sleep.

3306
01:36:03,291 --> 01:36:04,124
Sometimes it helps.

3307
01:36:04,160 --> 01:36:04,550
Hello?

3308
01:36:04,550 --> 01:36:05,211
I did not know.

3309
01:36:05,211 --> 01:36:06,044
The problem is like,

3310
01:36:06,060 --> 01:36:07,940
I mean industrial Jellos disgusting.

3311
01:36:07,940 --> 01:36:08,331
Like giving,

3312
01:36:08,331 --> 01:36:09,200
you want to know what's in there,

3313
01:36:09,380 --> 01:36:10,213
what is in there.

3314
01:36:10,370 --> 01:36:11,440
Like they,

3315
01:36:11,450 --> 01:36:15,920
they're taking a hooves and like
snouts and like all these like office,

3316
01:36:15,921 --> 01:36:17,690
it's like the Bologna of protein powder.

3317
01:36:18,050 --> 01:36:18,820
It's not good.

3318
01:36:18,820 --> 01:36:19,020
Well,

3319
01:36:19,020 --> 01:36:19,640
I mean it,

3320
01:36:19,640 --> 01:36:21,290
it's better than no Collagen.

3321
01:36:22,610 --> 01:36:23,300
What's most,

3322
01:36:23,300 --> 01:36:26,090
what's the best made that the best is
made out of the skin of the animal.

3323
01:36:26,150 --> 01:36:26,600
The skin.

3324
01:36:26,600 --> 01:36:27,050
Yeah.

3325
01:36:27,050 --> 01:36:28,640
So like that's the sort of stuff that,

3326
01:36:28,670 --> 01:36:30,380
that I use typically.

3327
01:36:30,650 --> 01:36:30,980
Um,

3328
01:36:30,980 --> 01:36:32,840
in fact next week I'll have,

3329
01:36:32,860 --> 01:36:33,590
um,

3330
01:36:33,590 --> 01:36:35,960
I'll have of listing for the,

3331
01:36:35,961 --> 01:36:39,440
the best kind of of it I've been
exploring college and for years.

3332
01:36:39,710 --> 01:36:42,740
So you can take straight college and you
can take straight gelatin and it's just

3333
01:36:42,741 --> 01:36:45,260
a question of basically how you want
it to taste and how you want it to be

3334
01:36:45,261 --> 01:36:46,094
absorbed into your food.

3335
01:36:46,400 --> 01:36:48,440
But the old days we would
make like soup from bones.

3336
01:36:48,440 --> 01:36:49,273
It's too much work.

3337
01:36:49,400 --> 01:36:52,370
So what you do now as you take a couple
of scoops of collagen powder and you

3338
01:36:52,371 --> 01:36:54,770
just put it in your smoothie or putting
in your soup and you've got all the

3339
01:36:54,771 --> 01:36:56,630
benefits of bone broth
with none of the trouble.

3340
01:36:56,631 --> 01:36:56,991
It's just,

3341
01:36:56,991 --> 01:36:59,150
it's too much work to
make all that prof no,

3342
01:36:59,480 --> 01:37:00,860
there's just a process.

3343
01:37:00,920 --> 01:37:02,200
They just take the,

3344
01:37:02,210 --> 01:37:02,990
the leather,

3345
01:37:02,990 --> 01:37:05,090
they take the outside and turn it into,

3346
01:37:05,120 --> 01:37:08,630
take the outside and they expose it
to enzymes and a [inaudible] acid.

3347
01:37:08,631 --> 01:37:09,200
Yeah.

3348
01:37:09,200 --> 01:37:12,470
And that breaks it down and
it's kind of a useful food.

3349
01:37:12,770 --> 01:37:17,450
It's one of those things that we used
to fight for a hundred years ago because

3350
01:37:17,451 --> 01:37:18,440
you had to get enough of it.

3351
01:37:18,441 --> 01:37:20,180
And it was one of the ways
of using the whole animal.

3352
01:37:20,181 --> 01:37:21,470
And now we just toss it.

3353
01:37:21,471 --> 01:37:25,880
And mostly so in your opinion and with
all those things that you've researched,

3354
01:37:25,881 --> 01:37:30,020
what you found is that you can't even
just not even like eggs is not good

3355
01:37:30,021 --> 01:37:30,230
enough.

3356
01:37:30,230 --> 01:37:31,190
Fish is not good enough.

3357
01:37:31,191 --> 01:37:32,540
Like you need animals,

3358
01:37:32,541 --> 01:37:33,380
you need mammals,

3359
01:37:33,381 --> 01:37:33,830
you need,

3360
01:37:33,830 --> 01:37:35,080
you need cows and shit.

3361
01:37:35,600 --> 01:37:36,560
At least some of the time.

3362
01:37:36,561 --> 01:37:37,730
I absolutely believe that.

3363
01:37:37,910 --> 01:37:38,511
I also believe,

3364
01:37:38,511 --> 01:37:39,021
let's face it,

3365
01:37:39,021 --> 01:37:39,920
you kill a chicken,

3366
01:37:40,060 --> 01:37:42,410
did one meal to kill that animal.

3367
01:37:42,530 --> 01:37:45,470
And chickens have the worst lives ever
unless they're like super pastured,

3368
01:37:45,471 --> 01:37:46,670
crazy expensive chickens.

3369
01:37:47,090 --> 01:37:48,740
So like you want to be a tortured animal.

3370
01:37:48,770 --> 01:37:51,320
Modern chickens can't even stand up on
their own because their breasts are so

3371
01:37:51,321 --> 01:37:51,561
big.

3372
01:37:51,561 --> 01:37:51,860
Like,

3373
01:37:51,860 --> 01:37:53,690
like they're one of
the most tweak species.

3374
01:37:54,290 --> 01:37:54,531
Yeah.

3375
01:37:54,531 --> 01:37:55,364
They're pretty tweak.

3376
01:37:55,560 --> 01:37:59,520
It's pretty fucked up when you see one
of those gigantic chicken farms and

3377
01:37:59,521 --> 01:38:02,770
they're all stacked on top of each
other and it just crap on each other.

3378
01:38:02,790 --> 01:38:03,271
And also,

3379
01:38:03,271 --> 01:38:04,230
so I see these people,

3380
01:38:04,231 --> 01:38:05,130
I could never eat red meat.

3381
01:38:05,160 --> 01:38:05,341
I'm like,

3382
01:38:05,341 --> 01:38:05,700
dude,

3383
01:38:05,700 --> 01:38:10,230
one animal will feed two
people basically for two years.

3384
01:38:10,710 --> 01:38:11,880
If they're eating normal amounts of it,

3385
01:38:11,881 --> 01:38:12,714
that's less death.

3386
01:38:12,860 --> 01:38:13,620
Yeah.

3387
01:38:13,620 --> 01:38:14,730
But it's a big death.

3388
01:38:14,760 --> 01:38:16,980
It's like nobody has a
problem with killing ants.

3389
01:38:17,010 --> 01:38:21,240
People are not like making protests in
front of a stores that sell raid ant

3390
01:38:21,241 --> 01:38:21,570
killer.

3391
01:38:21,570 --> 01:38:23,610
They don't give a fuck about the
hands cause they're so small.

3392
01:38:23,850 --> 01:38:26,530
It's like we have like a thing that you
could take an aunt like you find any on

3393
01:38:26,531 --> 01:38:30,000
any accountant gets dual your finger
and do that and you just flick it on the

3394
01:38:30,001 --> 01:38:30,900
ground like you went away.

3395
01:38:31,170 --> 01:38:32,310
You can't do that to a rat.

3396
01:38:32,490 --> 01:38:34,830
You can't hit a rat with a hammer and
it just throw it on the floor and now

3397
01:38:34,831 --> 01:38:35,850
you've got to clean that thing up.

3398
01:38:36,420 --> 01:38:37,081
The snail,

3399
01:38:37,081 --> 01:38:40,020
remember when it made that snail video
and everyone got pissed off at me?

3400
01:38:40,090 --> 01:38:40,411
Yeah.

3401
01:38:40,411 --> 01:38:41,250
He can't kill snails.

3402
01:38:41,390 --> 01:38:42,330
Snails big enough.

3403
01:38:42,690 --> 01:38:43,860
He stomped on an ant.

3404
01:38:43,860 --> 01:38:44,970
No one would have given a shit.

3405
01:38:45,150 --> 01:38:46,230
But you killed a snail?

3406
01:38:46,231 --> 01:38:46,411
No,

3407
01:38:46,411 --> 01:38:47,910
like this son of a bitch.

3408
01:38:48,120 --> 01:38:50,440
I put a snail on a list of
marines strip and it was awesome.

3409
01:38:50,730 --> 01:38:53,560
The thing about the thing about cows,

3410
01:38:54,420 --> 01:38:54,751
by the way,

3411
01:38:54,751 --> 01:38:56,570
he's almost 40 the,

3412
01:38:56,780 --> 01:38:57,810
the thing about cows,

3413
01:38:57,811 --> 01:38:59,790
those that they're big and like a,

3414
01:38:59,791 --> 01:39:00,061
you know,

3415
01:39:00,061 --> 01:39:03,420
an ant's tiny and it doesn't really bug
us that you can buy poisoned for ants

3416
01:39:03,421 --> 01:39:04,000
anywhere.

3417
01:39:04,000 --> 01:39:06,840
If you could sell cowboys and at the
store people would freak out because you

3418
01:39:06,841 --> 01:39:08,190
can't just kill cows like that.

3419
01:39:08,191 --> 01:39:08,750
They,

3420
01:39:08,750 --> 01:39:10,080
you know that you can buy rat poison.

3421
01:39:10,350 --> 01:39:10,830
Yeah.

3422
01:39:10,830 --> 01:39:13,290
The clients care about rats,

3423
01:39:13,890 --> 01:39:15,450
but then there's people
who have rats for pets.

3424
01:39:15,480 --> 01:39:16,313
Like man,

3425
01:39:16,590 --> 01:39:18,830
there's a lot of people that
actually lived off rats and the,

3426
01:39:18,920 --> 01:39:19,753
and what was it?

3427
01:39:19,950 --> 01:39:21,000
I forget Peru.

3428
01:39:21,001 --> 01:39:23,840
I believe we're Guinea pigs.

3429
01:39:23,841 --> 01:39:25,080
I like super common.

3430
01:39:25,200 --> 01:39:26,000
I've eaten a Guinea pig.

3431
01:39:26,000 --> 01:39:28,140
What is it like in Peru?

3432
01:39:28,141 --> 01:39:28,381
Yeah,

3433
01:39:28,381 --> 01:39:31,890
I went down there to do Iowasca with a
showman and they have Guinea pig food.

3434
01:39:31,920 --> 01:39:32,071
Yeah,

3435
01:39:32,071 --> 01:39:32,611
it's native.

3436
01:39:32,611 --> 01:39:33,960
There they are.

3437
01:39:34,080 --> 01:39:35,460
Let me see the technical term for it.

3438
01:39:35,490 --> 01:39:36,540
Fucking disgusting.

3439
01:39:37,400 --> 01:39:40,380
There's like no meat on them and they
stopped them with Rick rice and vegetables

3440
01:39:40,390 --> 01:39:41,210
don't taste good.

3441
01:39:41,210 --> 01:39:41,800
That's the,

3442
01:39:41,800 --> 01:39:44,670
there's like five bites of meat on a
whole Guinea pig and it doesn't taste very

3443
01:39:44,671 --> 01:39:44,851
good.

3444
01:39:44,851 --> 01:39:47,220
The bites you can get and the rest
of it's just like bones and skin.

3445
01:39:47,370 --> 01:39:49,380
It was the little family gross.

3446
01:39:49,410 --> 01:39:50,760
Those people are just trying to get by.

3447
01:39:50,780 --> 01:39:51,000
Yeah,

3448
01:39:51,000 --> 01:39:52,170
that's some tough times.

3449
01:39:52,680 --> 01:39:53,940
What I saw was this,

3450
01:39:53,941 --> 01:39:54,420
um,

3451
01:39:54,420 --> 01:39:57,420
Anthony Bourdain show and they went over
this guy's house and they had Guinea

3452
01:39:57,421 --> 01:39:58,770
pigs running around the kitchen,

3453
01:39:58,771 --> 01:39:59,670
like constantly running.

3454
01:39:59,671 --> 01:40:01,590
They were everywhere and
they would just pick one up,

3455
01:40:01,591 --> 01:40:02,370
take them over,

3456
01:40:02,370 --> 01:40:03,960
snap kill him,

3457
01:40:04,200 --> 01:40:05,590
got em and start cooking it.

3458
01:40:05,590 --> 01:40:07,470
And all these other dump
Fox are just running around.

3459
01:40:07,471 --> 01:40:08,460
They're like their pets.

3460
01:40:08,530 --> 01:40:10,470
It's practically until they get killed.

3461
01:40:10,650 --> 01:40:11,520
But they have a concert,

3462
01:40:11,550 --> 01:40:12,271
you say it's awful,

3463
01:40:12,271 --> 01:40:14,160
but they have a constant supply of meat.

3464
01:40:14,520 --> 01:40:17,070
And your point of view from Burbank,

3465
01:40:17,100 --> 01:40:17,521
you know,

3466
01:40:17,521 --> 01:40:20,640
is very different than their
point of view living in Peru.

3467
01:40:20,910 --> 01:40:22,100
There are two adorable though.

3468
01:40:22,150 --> 01:40:22,500
I yeah,

3469
01:40:22,500 --> 01:40:23,880
these houses don't even have windows.

3470
01:40:23,881 --> 01:40:24,300
Dude.

3471
01:40:24,300 --> 01:40:25,560
I used to have them as pets.

3472
01:40:25,600 --> 01:40:28,620
They are kind of cute but I
got enough if I was hungry.

3473
01:40:28,660 --> 01:40:30,900
[inaudible] you have children
and your children are hungry,

3474
01:40:30,901 --> 01:40:33,900
you're gonna eat the fuck out of some
Guinea pigs and there they're everywhere.

3475
01:40:33,901 --> 01:40:34,171
Dude.

3476
01:40:34,171 --> 01:40:35,190
They have like 30 of them.

3477
01:40:35,191 --> 01:40:36,024
We had cat,

3478
01:40:36,870 --> 01:40:39,930
not on purpose but I've been to a
lot of Taco trucks so I'm not sure.

3479
01:40:40,040 --> 01:40:41,340
Well do you think taco trucks really,

3480
01:40:41,430 --> 01:40:45,000
so really depends on where you are.

3481
01:40:45,000 --> 01:40:45,900
And I have a theory,

3482
01:40:45,901 --> 01:40:47,550
tell me if this theory
makes any sense at all.

3483
01:40:47,580 --> 01:40:51,690
But I have a theory that things that are
difficult to catch or good for you like

3484
01:40:51,691 --> 01:40:52,800
wild fish,

3485
01:40:53,140 --> 01:40:54,280
wild game,

3486
01:40:54,430 --> 01:40:56,320
things that run quick like deer,

3487
01:40:56,321 --> 01:40:56,660
deer.

3488
01:40:56,660 --> 01:40:59,770
Very good for you because they run fast
to try and get the fuck away cause they

3489
01:40:59,771 --> 01:41:00,640
know that delicious.

3490
01:41:00,760 --> 01:41:04,480
They know there's what like highly
sought after and then things like cows,

3491
01:41:04,481 --> 01:41:05,800
it just kind of stand around.

3492
01:41:05,980 --> 01:41:08,230
Probably not as good as
anything to that theory.

3493
01:41:08,500 --> 01:41:10,250
I don't buy it either.

3494
01:41:10,690 --> 01:41:12,850
Here's why the thing humming dirt mark,

3495
01:41:13,210 --> 01:41:15,940
the things that can run really fast and
sprint don't have enough fat on them.

3496
01:41:15,970 --> 01:41:17,830
Like when the Indians
would kill a buffalo,

3497
01:41:17,850 --> 01:41:21,180
like the first thing you eat is like
the big fatty hump on the back and then

3498
01:41:21,181 --> 01:41:21,730
that's,

3499
01:41:21,730 --> 01:41:23,650
that's a fat solid fat.

3500
01:41:23,680 --> 01:41:26,170
Is that like for storing food for them?

3501
01:41:26,170 --> 01:41:29,440
So in fact if you take a real grasp
at buffalo that fat is orange.

3502
01:41:29,470 --> 01:41:33,040
It's actually like almost like a salmon
color and most of the buffalo you can

3503
01:41:33,041 --> 01:41:33,311
buy it,

3504
01:41:33,311 --> 01:41:35,320
they finish on grand cause no
one wants to buy orange fat.

3505
01:41:35,321 --> 01:41:38,260
I'm like man give me a big old like
two pound hunk of orange fat like that.

3506
01:41:38,670 --> 01:41:39,390
Why can they,

3507
01:41:39,390 --> 01:41:41,850
I mean the most of it finishes
on green or all of it come in,

3508
01:41:41,851 --> 01:41:42,501
can you get it?

3509
01:41:42,501 --> 01:41:43,630
It finishes on on,

3510
01:41:43,810 --> 01:41:47,290
I've asked that like butchers that
really high end markets about that and

3511
01:41:47,380 --> 01:41:50,390
they're like yeah we were one of the
guys said and we tried it one time at

3512
01:41:50,391 --> 01:41:50,830
orange,

3513
01:41:50,830 --> 01:41:51,610
we've got to throw it out.

3514
01:41:51,610 --> 01:41:52,443
No one would buy it.

3515
01:41:52,490 --> 01:41:55,360
That's so your probably order it online
just to get it like a hundred percent

3516
01:41:55,361 --> 01:41:55,751
grass fed.

3517
01:41:55,751 --> 01:41:56,680
I need to get that.

3518
01:41:56,680 --> 01:41:57,251
I need to get that.

3519
01:41:57,251 --> 01:41:58,570
Just to find out what it would taste like.

3520
01:41:58,600 --> 01:42:00,490
It's pretty delicious when
you get like real fat.

3521
01:42:00,491 --> 01:42:02,210
In fact bisons good.

3522
01:42:02,710 --> 01:42:06,740
Even if you take like just the fats
and good quality butter versus uh,

3523
01:42:06,820 --> 01:42:07,180
you know,

3524
01:42:07,180 --> 01:42:08,013
crap butter.

3525
01:42:08,200 --> 01:42:09,520
I've had like vegetarian friends,

3526
01:42:09,521 --> 01:42:09,731
I'm like,

3527
01:42:09,731 --> 01:42:10,121
come on over,

3528
01:42:10,121 --> 01:42:11,530
let me make one of my soups for you.

3529
01:42:11,890 --> 01:42:13,030
And it's,

3530
01:42:13,031 --> 01:42:13,241
you know,

3531
01:42:13,241 --> 01:42:15,040
butter and I use the MCT oil.

3532
01:42:15,370 --> 01:42:15,671
In fact,

3533
01:42:15,671 --> 01:42:17,410
next week I've got my bulletproof MCT oil,

3534
01:42:17,411 --> 01:42:17,720
like,

3535
01:42:17,720 --> 01:42:18,670
like on the shelves.

3536
01:42:18,730 --> 01:42:19,750
I'm super stoked on that.

3537
01:42:19,840 --> 01:42:20,470
What is it?

3538
01:42:20,470 --> 01:42:23,380
It's a six times stronger
extract of coconut oil.

3539
01:42:23,530 --> 01:42:25,480
So it's two of the medium change.

3540
01:42:25,481 --> 01:42:29,500
The ones that are most responsible for
losing weight and for cognitive function

3541
01:42:29,860 --> 01:42:31,940
where that's all that's in
there and it has no flavor.

3542
01:42:31,941 --> 01:42:33,270
So you can like make Manet's out of it.

3543
01:42:33,280 --> 01:42:34,091
How's that created?

3544
01:42:34,091 --> 01:42:36,560
They take coconut oil and process
that somebody has centrifuged.

3545
01:42:36,570 --> 01:42:36,790
Yeah,

3546
01:42:36,790 --> 01:42:39,010
so we spin it and then we
pull out just those ones.

3547
01:42:39,011 --> 01:42:40,210
And I have the only brand I've,

3548
01:42:40,320 --> 01:42:41,153
I've heard anywhere.

3549
01:42:41,330 --> 01:42:42,550
What does that center future work?

3550
01:42:42,580 --> 01:42:43,710
So it's a,

3551
01:42:43,750 --> 01:42:46,660
basically you just spin it really fast
and when they do like your blood tubes to

3552
01:42:46,661 --> 01:42:49,650
separate out the plasma and the
and the cells when you spin it,

3553
01:42:49,660 --> 01:42:51,560
the different weights of fat line up.

3554
01:42:51,640 --> 01:42:55,540
So we pull out the two most precious
ones right in the middle band there and

3555
01:42:55,541 --> 01:42:57,250
then we take the rest of it and
we give that to other people.

3556
01:42:57,910 --> 01:42:59,140
It's ridiculous.

3557
01:42:59,500 --> 01:43:01,150
And this is coming out right now.

3558
01:43:01,210 --> 01:43:02,590
It's like it should be
on the site right now.

3559
01:43:02,591 --> 01:43:03,380
Like you can preorder it.

3560
01:43:03,380 --> 01:43:06,280
I just put it out the bulletproof
or bulletproof executive coms,

3561
01:43:06,281 --> 01:43:11,050
bulletproof exec.com bulletproof exact.com
and you have your whole story is up

3562
01:43:11,051 --> 01:43:12,210
there of how you,

3563
01:43:12,270 --> 01:43:16,570
so for Po folks that don't have the
patients to go and listen to this podcast

3564
01:43:16,571 --> 01:43:16,781
again,

3565
01:43:16,781 --> 01:43:21,700
there's a fuck load of information on
this site as well as not just the upgraded

3566
01:43:21,701 --> 01:43:22,810
MCT oil.

3567
01:43:22,810 --> 01:43:24,040
You've got upgraded coffee,

3568
01:43:24,041 --> 01:43:24,874
everything's upgraded,

3569
01:43:25,330 --> 01:43:26,110
great chef.

3570
01:43:26,110 --> 01:43:27,670
And here's what it means
when it's upgraded.

3571
01:43:27,700 --> 01:43:31,510
Like I'm looking at the whole process
of making something and how do you make

3572
01:43:31,511 --> 01:43:33,130
that process as good as it can be.

3573
01:43:33,250 --> 01:43:33,911
Like my background,

3574
01:43:33,911 --> 01:43:35,260
I really am a computer hacker.

3575
01:43:35,261 --> 01:43:36,790
Like I've studied computer science,

3576
01:43:36,880 --> 01:43:38,290
I work in computer security.

3577
01:43:38,470 --> 01:43:39,910
I'm not an actively a hacker,

3578
01:43:39,911 --> 01:43:40,870
like I'm an executive.

3579
01:43:40,871 --> 01:43:44,860
But like I understand the mindset of
changing a system to get the outcome you

3580
01:43:44,861 --> 01:43:45,400
want.

3581
01:43:45,400 --> 01:43:46,750
It turns out like to make the coffee.

3582
01:43:46,930 --> 01:43:50,200
The problem was actually how the
beans get turned into green coffee.

3583
01:43:50,201 --> 01:43:52,100
That's where most the problems happen.

3584
01:43:52,310 --> 01:43:52,821
So I went through,

3585
01:43:52,821 --> 01:43:55,040
I learned all about all this
stuff from multiple disciplines,

3586
01:43:55,041 --> 01:43:56,600
pulled it all together and said,

3587
01:43:56,601 --> 01:43:59,000
what if I created this new
process for making coffee?

3588
01:43:59,001 --> 01:44:00,350
They didn't have the toxins in it.

3589
01:44:00,710 --> 01:44:04,190
And you look at that like we're about
done with the study where we're getting

3590
01:44:04,191 --> 01:44:08,370
advice from Stanford University on
the cognitive function of this coffee.

3591
01:44:08,410 --> 01:44:12,020
So we're comparing normal coffee versus
this upgraded coffee to show what it

3592
01:44:12,021 --> 01:44:13,670
does to your response
time and your attention.

3593
01:44:14,030 --> 01:44:17,360
And like we don't have enough results to
be statistically significant yet we're

3594
01:44:17,361 --> 01:44:18,590
still recruiting people.

3595
01:44:18,740 --> 01:44:20,570
The results I have say yeah works.

3596
01:44:20,930 --> 01:44:22,880
So it's like this is real stuff.

3597
01:44:22,881 --> 01:44:27,710
And every step of the way when you create
a food tells you how the food is going

3598
01:44:27,711 --> 01:44:28,580
to make you perform.

3599
01:44:28,790 --> 01:44:32,890
And what I'm trying to do is help people
understand like if for one day they can

3600
01:44:32,891 --> 01:44:35,540
just have the best day ever where
like their energy and their focus and

3601
01:44:35,541 --> 01:44:38,900
everything is super clear and they
just like feel like a great golden God.

3602
01:44:39,080 --> 01:44:40,160
If you do that one time,

3603
01:44:40,161 --> 01:44:42,380
you know you're capable of it and
you can start working towards that.

3604
01:44:42,590 --> 01:44:46,040
But most people I know have felt like
crap without knowing it most of their

3605
01:44:46,041 --> 01:44:46,360
life.

3606
01:44:46,360 --> 01:44:48,080
They've never had a wonderful day.

3607
01:44:48,410 --> 01:44:52,340
Once you have that day you can learn
how to kick more ass repeatedly.

3608
01:44:52,640 --> 01:44:54,080
So it's like get all the crap out of that.

3609
01:44:54,081 --> 01:44:56,420
I just do it right for a week
and just see what can happen.

3610
01:44:56,590 --> 01:44:57,840
You look at the comments on my blog,

3611
01:44:57,841 --> 01:44:58,341
like people,

3612
01:44:58,341 --> 01:44:58,911
they do this,

3613
01:44:58,911 --> 01:44:59,780
it takes like six weeks.

3614
01:44:59,781 --> 01:45:02,990
It's not that hard to do and all of a
sudden like you know you have twice the

3615
01:45:02,991 --> 01:45:03,710
energy you had before.

3616
01:45:03,710 --> 01:45:05,300
Like that's what I'm
looking to do for people.

3617
01:45:05,480 --> 01:45:06,650
And when you have twice the energy,

3618
01:45:06,651 --> 01:45:07,730
you get twice the shit done.

3619
01:45:08,150 --> 01:45:08,850
I tell you,

3620
01:45:08,850 --> 01:45:10,370
I mentioned I'm a full time executive.

3621
01:45:10,370 --> 01:45:11,360
I wrote this book,

3622
01:45:11,361 --> 01:45:14,870
Wiley's my publisher Gary Tobbs
introduced me to my agent in New York.

3623
01:45:15,020 --> 01:45:17,450
Like it's a tier one book
with 1300 references.

3624
01:45:17,660 --> 01:45:19,520
I started the bulletproof executive blog,

3625
01:45:19,670 --> 01:45:21,770
which is in the top 25,000 blogs now,

3626
01:45:21,771 --> 01:45:22,970
150,000 people a month.

3627
01:45:22,971 --> 01:45:23,720
See yet.

3628
01:45:23,720 --> 01:45:24,170
Uh,

3629
01:45:24,170 --> 01:45:26,150
and I'm a dad of two young kids.

3630
01:45:26,280 --> 01:45:28,340
I see them on a very regular basis.

3631
01:45:28,570 --> 01:45:30,140
Like for me to be able
to do all this stuff,

3632
01:45:30,141 --> 01:45:33,320
I could have never done this in my mid
twenties it's cause I trained my brain

3633
01:45:33,321 --> 01:45:36,770
because I got my mitochondria functioning
and I got my hormones functioning.

3634
01:45:37,010 --> 01:45:40,130
You looked at the body
like your computer system.

3635
01:45:40,160 --> 01:45:40,993
Absolutely.

3636
01:45:41,230 --> 01:45:42,770
And where are you the
first kind of do that?

3637
01:45:43,340 --> 01:45:43,820
You know,

3638
01:45:43,820 --> 01:45:44,510
there's,

3639
01:45:44,510 --> 01:45:45,890
there aren't that many computer guys.

3640
01:45:45,891 --> 01:45:49,160
Like I'm 40 and the oldest
computer guys are like 65 right.

3641
01:45:49,520 --> 01:45:51,950
So certainly we've talked for
years about this and there's,

3642
01:45:51,951 --> 01:45:52,340
you know,

3643
01:45:52,340 --> 01:45:54,380
the whole cyber punk thing,

3644
01:45:54,381 --> 01:45:55,250
which I admit,

3645
01:45:55,390 --> 01:45:56,690
I admit I was a part of,

3646
01:45:56,691 --> 01:45:56,871
you know,

3647
01:45:56,871 --> 01:45:58,520
mirrored sunglasses and stuff like that.

3648
01:45:58,850 --> 01:46:00,440
But I'm one of the early guys like,

3649
01:46:00,820 --> 01:46:01,370
um,

3650
01:46:01,370 --> 01:46:02,390
a lot of the Russians,

3651
01:46:02,420 --> 01:46:04,160
the Russian space program
did a lot of this stuff.

3652
01:46:04,330 --> 01:46:05,420
Like this is a device,

3653
01:46:05,510 --> 01:46:07,700
this is called a is an older one,

3654
01:46:07,730 --> 01:46:09,530
but it's the only one
you can get that does,

3655
01:46:10,340 --> 01:46:12,620
that does programming where
you can pick the frequency.

3656
01:46:12,621 --> 01:46:14,190
But I'll run a current across my brain.

3657
01:46:14,220 --> 01:46:16,400
This is actively at the same
thing you do to a computer.

3658
01:46:16,790 --> 01:46:17,301
When you do that,

3659
01:46:17,301 --> 01:46:18,740
you can put yourself in the gamma state.

3660
01:46:18,741 --> 01:46:19,880
That's really hard to get into.

3661
01:46:20,030 --> 01:46:22,850
You just stick the electrodes on your
head and where that puts you in a gamma

3662
01:46:22,851 --> 01:46:23,091
state.

3663
01:46:23,091 --> 01:46:24,080
And what's the benefit of that?

3664
01:46:24,110 --> 01:46:28,040
Gamma state is actually a state where
the Dalai Lama just a announced a cash

3665
01:46:28,041 --> 01:46:31,010
reward for anyone who could help him
get into a gamma state in less than four

3666
01:46:31,011 --> 01:46:31,341
hours.

3667
01:46:31,341 --> 01:46:32,390
Cause that's how long it takes him.

3668
01:46:32,600 --> 01:46:34,400
He's looking for
neuroscience ways to do it.

3669
01:46:34,550 --> 01:46:37,400
So literally you stick these things
on your forehead as a Dalai Lama.

3670
01:46:37,401 --> 01:46:38,570
Try the isolation tanks.

3671
01:46:39,020 --> 01:46:39,561
I don't know,

3672
01:46:39,561 --> 01:46:40,400
but it wouldn't surprise me.

3673
01:46:40,401 --> 01:46:42,950
He's pretty open with his
neuro neuroscience stuff.

3674
01:46:43,310 --> 01:46:44,240
But you hook this thing up,

3675
01:46:44,241 --> 01:46:47,000
you turn it on like that
and now it's running.

3676
01:46:47,860 --> 01:46:49,540
You start good.

3677
01:46:50,220 --> 01:46:51,080
It sounds like you're,

3678
01:46:51,090 --> 01:46:53,370
it sounds like a
Frankenstein or something.

3679
01:46:54,240 --> 01:46:55,073
What are you doing?

3680
01:46:55,260 --> 01:46:56,110
So

3681
01:46:58,050 --> 01:46:59,190
it's grass fed.

3682
01:46:59,700 --> 01:47:00,211
What I'm doing now,

3683
01:47:00,211 --> 01:47:00,860
I'm running,

3684
01:47:00,860 --> 01:47:02,710
running my brain is crap.

3685
01:47:02,711 --> 01:47:05,280
Sematic and grass fed drink.

3686
01:47:05,880 --> 01:47:06,900
So what you do something like that.

3687
01:47:06,901 --> 01:47:08,190
It is literally like you watered,

3688
01:47:08,250 --> 01:47:10,560
changing the waves in your
brain like a computer.

3689
01:47:10,590 --> 01:47:11,640
And what is the benefit of that?

3690
01:47:11,641 --> 01:47:12,210
Again,

3691
01:47:12,210 --> 01:47:13,170
like when you put that on,

3692
01:47:13,171 --> 01:47:14,460
what is it actively do to you?

3693
01:47:14,520 --> 01:47:16,110
It depends on what setting you put it on.

3694
01:47:16,250 --> 01:47:17,910
If I'm going to be writing like a lot,

3695
01:47:18,150 --> 01:47:20,610
I'll put it on a gamma state and
you're just in this like focused,

3696
01:47:20,611 --> 01:47:22,020
amazing kind of flow state.

3697
01:47:22,260 --> 01:47:26,280
Although Alpha is also something
that's more recognized as a flow state,

3698
01:47:26,400 --> 01:47:28,110
so you can control what
state your brain is in.

3699
01:47:28,260 --> 01:47:30,300
You want to get like rapid
recovery during sleep.

3700
01:47:30,690 --> 01:47:32,100
If I'm only going to sleep two hours,

3701
01:47:32,101 --> 01:47:34,800
I put that on and I put it on 1.5 hertz,

3702
01:47:34,801 --> 01:47:36,210
which is associated with deep sleep.

3703
01:47:36,390 --> 01:47:37,800
And when I wake up I feel really good.

3704
01:47:37,830 --> 01:47:40,620
I didn't get all the benefits of
memory consolidation and dreaming.

3705
01:47:40,710 --> 01:47:41,543
Do you sell this thing?

3706
01:47:42,120 --> 01:47:42,540
No.

3707
01:47:42,540 --> 01:47:43,373
You can just buy it.

3708
01:47:43,530 --> 01:47:45,570
Do you explained it on
your website or anywhere?

3709
01:47:45,690 --> 01:47:46,020
Yeah,

3710
01:47:46,020 --> 01:47:47,430
I have a top 10 brain hacks.

3711
01:47:47,431 --> 01:47:48,181
Video is a talk.

3712
01:47:48,181 --> 01:47:49,680
I gave it south by southwest on this.

3713
01:47:49,920 --> 01:47:50,790
I would love to try that.

3714
01:47:50,820 --> 01:47:54,030
And so it's giving a low
level electrical signal.

3715
01:47:54,060 --> 01:47:54,540
Yup.

3716
01:47:54,540 --> 01:47:56,550
And what does it do exactly?

3717
01:47:56,580 --> 01:47:57,001
In fact,

3718
01:47:57,001 --> 01:47:58,290
I have a touching the head.

3719
01:47:58,291 --> 01:48:00,870
So it's sending electrical
waves in the brain.

3720
01:48:00,890 --> 01:48:02,960
It's running a slight
current back and forth.

3721
01:48:02,970 --> 01:48:03,860
I try that one again.

3722
01:48:03,940 --> 01:48:04,001
Yeah,

3723
01:48:04,001 --> 01:48:04,740
sure.

3724
01:48:04,740 --> 01:48:05,280
I've had,

3725
01:48:05,280 --> 01:48:06,031
I got one.

3726
01:48:06,031 --> 01:48:07,080
You got me one a while ago.

3727
01:48:08,070 --> 01:48:09,990
We were trying to get you to
quit smoking and didn't work.

3728
01:48:10,470 --> 01:48:11,310
You've never used it either?

3729
01:48:11,360 --> 01:48:11,520
No,

3730
01:48:11,520 --> 01:48:12,360
I used it a lot.

3731
01:48:12,361 --> 01:48:12,940
It's just,

3732
01:48:12,940 --> 01:48:15,390
it's shocked I stick those
things on your forehead.

3733
01:48:15,450 --> 01:48:15,651
Yeah.

3734
01:48:15,651 --> 01:48:16,620
I'd like clips to your ears,

3735
01:48:16,621 --> 01:48:16,801
right?

3736
01:48:16,801 --> 01:48:17,391
It was a little freaky.

3737
01:48:17,391 --> 01:48:17,810
Yeah,

3738
01:48:17,810 --> 01:48:18,990
this one you said of your clips,

3739
01:48:18,991 --> 01:48:19,650
but I used to,

3740
01:48:19,650 --> 01:48:20,310
yeah,

3741
01:48:20,310 --> 01:48:22,230
I use the temple things just
because they're a little easier.

3742
01:48:23,270 --> 01:48:23,750
Yeah.

3743
01:48:23,750 --> 01:48:24,081
And uh,

3744
01:48:24,081 --> 01:48:25,580
this is actually like
a 10 year old device.

3745
01:48:25,620 --> 01:48:28,280
The problem is most of the new ones have
only one frequency and this one lets

3746
01:48:28,281 --> 01:48:29,230
you adjust the frequencies,

3747
01:48:29,240 --> 01:48:29,900
which is,

3748
01:48:29,900 --> 01:48:30,733
which is helpful.

3749
01:48:31,070 --> 01:48:31,431
Okay.

3750
01:48:31,431 --> 01:48:33,990
I'm putting on my head and hit the power
button on there or just hand me the

3751
01:48:33,991 --> 01:48:34,721
controls if you want it.

3752
01:48:34,721 --> 01:48:35,150
Okay.

3753
01:48:35,150 --> 01:48:35,983
How are you up?

3754
01:48:37,580 --> 01:48:38,413
Okay.

3755
01:48:38,820 --> 01:48:39,653
Stay posted later.

3756
01:48:39,660 --> 01:48:40,080
Alright.

3757
01:48:40,080 --> 01:48:40,320
Alright.

3758
01:48:40,320 --> 01:48:41,011
That feels weird.

3759
01:48:41,011 --> 01:48:42,570
There's a volume control right here.

3760
01:48:42,750 --> 01:48:43,950
It's Ding in my head.

3761
01:48:44,030 --> 01:48:45,150
It feels like there's up turn up,

3762
01:48:45,240 --> 01:48:47,450
turn that volume control
until it doesn't stain.

3763
01:48:48,450 --> 01:48:51,870
It feels like a bee who's like trying
to like say he's playing a game of just

3764
01:48:51,871 --> 01:48:52,704
the tip.

3765
01:48:53,370 --> 01:48:53,820
There you go.

3766
01:48:53,820 --> 01:48:57,390
These playing just the tip of the
Stinger is not quite seem like,

3767
01:48:57,400 --> 01:48:58,233
come on man.

3768
01:48:59,360 --> 01:49:01,380
Just let me get the Zyban.

3769
01:49:02,040 --> 01:49:02,480
Yeah.

3770
01:49:02,480 --> 01:49:03,313
Um,

3771
01:49:03,410 --> 01:49:03,810
just,

3772
01:49:03,810 --> 01:49:04,740
it feels interesting.

3773
01:49:04,800 --> 01:49:05,070
Turn.

3774
01:49:05,070 --> 01:49:06,420
Turn it down so it doesn't hurt,

3775
01:49:06,450 --> 01:49:07,140
that's for sure.

3776
01:49:07,140 --> 01:49:08,010
What is it at now?

3777
01:49:08,020 --> 01:49:08,850
I turned it up.

3778
01:49:08,850 --> 01:49:09,630
Okay.

3779
01:49:09,630 --> 01:49:10,240
Is that bad?

3780
01:49:10,240 --> 01:49:10,860
It hurts.

3781
01:49:10,860 --> 01:49:11,040
No,

3782
01:49:11,040 --> 01:49:11,521
it's not bad,

3783
01:49:11,521 --> 01:49:14,250
but it'll still work if you just have
a little tiny tingle that you do.

3784
01:49:14,251 --> 01:49:15,360
You don't want to get really smart.

3785
01:49:15,361 --> 01:49:17,340
If I have to fucking suffer
through a little bit of pain,

3786
01:49:17,550 --> 01:49:18,440
I'm down to it.

3787
01:49:18,460 --> 01:49:21,930
If you do this for 1520 minutes
for the next several hours,

3788
01:49:21,960 --> 01:49:24,780
the Alpha and the front half of your
brain will be much higher than it was

3789
01:49:24,781 --> 01:49:25,410
before.

3790
01:49:25,410 --> 01:49:26,610
Why doesn't everybody know about this?

3791
01:49:26,611 --> 01:49:27,390
This is ridiculous.

3792
01:49:27,390 --> 01:49:28,350
Iphone could do this.

3793
01:49:28,380 --> 01:49:28,801
How serious.

3794
01:49:28,801 --> 01:49:29,431
It's not that hard.

3795
01:49:29,431 --> 01:49:30,264
This could be an APP.

3796
01:49:30,320 --> 01:49:30,600
It,

3797
01:49:30,600 --> 01:49:30,811
well,

3798
01:49:30,811 --> 01:49:31,021
I mean,

3799
01:49:31,021 --> 01:49:32,820
you'd have to set the
iPhone up to do that,

3800
01:49:32,821 --> 01:49:35,310
but this whole quantified self thing I
do like there's a whole bunch of people

3801
01:49:35,311 --> 01:49:36,210
looking at this stuff.

3802
01:49:36,240 --> 01:49:38,100
How long before the government
arrested you for all this?

3803
01:49:38,940 --> 01:49:39,360
You know,

3804
01:49:39,360 --> 01:49:40,720
I didn't create super people.

3805
01:49:40,740 --> 01:49:40,920
Well,

3806
01:49:40,920 --> 01:49:42,660
the only thing that I've invented that's,

3807
01:49:42,690 --> 01:49:44,060
that's like new.

3808
01:49:44,080 --> 01:49:46,320
Some of the training
techniques are different,

3809
01:49:46,470 --> 01:49:48,040
but like I didn't invent
cerebral electrical

3810
01:49:48,040 --> 01:49:49,930
stimulation the Russians
did in their space program.

3811
01:49:50,170 --> 01:49:53,820
The reason that this came about is they
said it costs a lot of money to send a

3812
01:49:53,830 --> 01:49:55,300
cosmonaut up into space.

3813
01:49:55,301 --> 01:49:56,350
What if we didn't have,

3814
01:49:56,380 --> 01:49:57,101
if they didn't sleep,

3815
01:49:57,101 --> 01:49:58,890
we could send one third
less cost the knots.

3816
01:49:59,200 --> 01:50:00,070
So they built this,

3817
01:50:00,130 --> 01:50:01,570
well I have a uh,

3818
01:50:01,900 --> 01:50:03,520
one of those turbo sonic machines.

3819
01:50:03,521 --> 01:50:06,850
I know that you've talked very highly of
those things to tell me what those do.

3820
01:50:07,200 --> 01:50:08,950
Cause somebody told me when
I bought it and I forgot,

3821
01:50:09,100 --> 01:50:10,000
but I use it all the time.

3822
01:50:10,030 --> 01:50:10,301
Oh yeah.

3823
01:50:10,301 --> 01:50:10,690
Awesome.

3824
01:50:10,690 --> 01:50:11,680
Those things rock.

3825
01:50:11,710 --> 01:50:13,000
So I'll tell you flat out,

3826
01:50:13,030 --> 01:50:13,301
you know,

3827
01:50:13,301 --> 01:50:15,580
if you can afford 12 or 15
grand by the turbo sonic,

3828
01:50:15,581 --> 01:50:17,350
I've used one for almost a year.

3829
01:50:17,740 --> 01:50:19,960
It's the most programmable
and it's the quietest,

3830
01:50:20,170 --> 01:50:21,880
but does the same thing
that these other ones do.

3831
01:50:21,881 --> 01:50:25,450
Any of the ones that vibrate you up and
down only are going to have the same

3832
01:50:25,451 --> 01:50:25,900
effect.

3833
01:50:25,900 --> 01:50:28,600
There's a whole bunch of cheap ones
that do like a side to side rocking that

3834
01:50:28,601 --> 01:50:29,770
messes up your low back.

3835
01:50:30,490 --> 01:50:31,240
So,

3836
01:50:31,240 --> 01:50:32,170
and also they tend to break.

3837
01:50:32,171 --> 01:50:34,660
I've broken welds on a
couple of the stoop units.

3838
01:50:34,690 --> 01:50:38,850
It's some sort of an soundwave
with speaker mechanism.

3839
01:50:38,851 --> 01:50:40,840
It's not really a sound
wave with turbo sonic,

3840
01:50:40,841 --> 01:50:42,010
but it is a speaker mechanism.

3841
01:50:42,100 --> 01:50:43,090
You've seen like a Woofer,

3842
01:50:43,091 --> 01:50:44,770
like a heavy duty
subwoofer and it goes doon,

3843
01:50:44,771 --> 01:50:45,011
doon,

3844
01:50:45,011 --> 01:50:45,844
doon.

3845
01:50:46,150 --> 01:50:49,210
What's going on there is they
took the sound baffles off,

3846
01:50:49,211 --> 01:50:50,830
but they left us those speaker coil.

3847
01:50:50,831 --> 01:50:54,710
So it moves you up using that really
efficient way of moving that speaker uses.

3848
01:50:54,830 --> 01:50:55,750
It's very precise.

3849
01:50:56,090 --> 01:51:00,250
I'm the one that I have that costs 10%
as much to make it like within reach for

3850
01:51:00,251 --> 01:51:01,240
the normal person.

3851
01:51:01,960 --> 01:51:02,980
It uses a motor,

3852
01:51:03,010 --> 01:51:03,671
so it's louder,

3853
01:51:03,671 --> 01:51:06,640
but it has exactly the same up and down
vibration that the turbo sonic would

3854
01:51:06,641 --> 01:51:07,474
have.

3855
01:51:07,480 --> 01:51:10,030
And there's another brand called power
played out there and they're all based on

3856
01:51:10,060 --> 01:51:14,350
very similar principles and that's that
when you vibrate the body like that,

3857
01:51:14,650 --> 01:51:18,250
you're triggering something called
PSO electric signals in the bone.

3858
01:51:18,251 --> 01:51:19,690
So it increases bone density.

3859
01:51:20,080 --> 01:51:22,120
Your muscles have to keep
tensing and releasing,

3860
01:51:22,121 --> 01:51:22,811
tensing and releasing.

3861
01:51:22,811 --> 01:51:24,460
So you actually can build muscle on those,

3862
01:51:24,461 --> 01:51:25,990
especially if you know
you hold a kettle bell.

3863
01:51:26,380 --> 01:51:26,830
Um,

3864
01:51:26,830 --> 01:51:27,041
you know,

3865
01:51:27,041 --> 01:51:28,120
just hold out like this.

3866
01:51:28,330 --> 01:51:29,141
Like all of a sudden,

3867
01:51:29,141 --> 01:51:30,010
30 times a second.

3868
01:51:30,011 --> 01:51:30,221
You know,

3869
01:51:30,221 --> 01:51:31,020
you're doing this,

3870
01:51:31,020 --> 01:51:33,790
and I hate to say this is like the
adult version of the shake weight,

3871
01:51:34,030 --> 01:51:39,030
but it's powered and it seriously works
in the final thing you get from this has

3872
01:51:39,101 --> 01:51:40,160
to do with uh,

3873
01:51:40,240 --> 01:51:41,770
lymphatic circulation in the body.

3874
01:51:42,100 --> 01:51:43,610
So we have this whole waste,

3875
01:51:43,630 --> 01:51:46,390
the waste elimination system
called your lymph system.

3876
01:51:46,810 --> 01:51:49,330
And the way the lymph moves
is you have to move your body.

3877
01:51:49,690 --> 01:51:50,800
And this is why people say,

3878
01:51:50,801 --> 01:51:50,891
Oh,

3879
01:51:50,891 --> 01:51:51,521
you have to move.

3880
01:51:51,521 --> 01:51:53,330
Movement is so important for you move.

3881
01:51:53,331 --> 01:51:54,700
It's important because it moves lymph.

3882
01:51:54,880 --> 01:51:56,080
It's not cause it burns calories,

3883
01:51:56,100 --> 01:51:56,950
it doesn't burn calories.

3884
01:51:56,951 --> 01:51:57,790
That's a distraction.

3885
01:51:58,360 --> 01:52:01,210
Movement doesn't burn calories
when it burns calories,

3886
01:52:01,211 --> 01:52:02,440
but that doesn't make you lose weight.

3887
01:52:02,800 --> 01:52:04,000
Like compared to say,

3888
01:52:04,510 --> 01:52:07,570
a short high intensity interval will make
you lose more weight than going for a

3889
01:52:07,571 --> 01:52:09,220
walk that burns more calories in the end.

3890
01:52:09,420 --> 01:52:10,660
The high intensity interval,

3891
01:52:10,750 --> 01:52:11,920
it's a hormonal effect you're getting.

3892
01:52:12,400 --> 01:52:13,600
This is like Dr Doug Mic,

3893
01:52:13,680 --> 01:52:14,080
uh,

3894
01:52:14,080 --> 01:52:14,980
macduffs work.

3895
01:52:15,430 --> 01:52:15,730
Uh,

3896
01:52:15,730 --> 01:52:16,870
so I met gfes work,

3897
01:52:17,490 --> 01:52:17,890
um,

3898
01:52:17,890 --> 01:52:18,850
from body by science.

3899
01:52:18,851 --> 01:52:22,900
Like there's definitely like enormous
loads of research there about caloric

3900
01:52:22,901 --> 01:52:27,010
consumption from exercise and diet and
they don't line up for weight loss.

3901
01:52:27,190 --> 01:52:27,820
They just,

3902
01:52:27,820 --> 01:52:28,331
in fact,

3903
01:52:28,331 --> 01:52:28,471
yeah,

3904
01:52:28,471 --> 01:52:29,950
I have a really good blog post about that.

3905
01:52:30,400 --> 01:52:31,210
Whoa.

3906
01:52:31,210 --> 01:52:31,610
In fact,

3907
01:52:31,610 --> 01:52:32,470
the blog post is called,

3908
01:52:32,471 --> 01:52:35,590
it's not the calories stupid and it was
in response to a New York Times piece

3909
01:52:35,770 --> 01:52:37,840
where they actually wrote
it's the calorie stupid.

3910
01:52:37,841 --> 01:52:40,840
Even though the study that they'd written
about showed it wasn't the calories

3911
01:52:40,960 --> 01:52:43,390
like different people at the same amount
of calories and gain different amounts

3912
01:52:43,391 --> 01:52:43,830
of fat.

3913
01:52:43,830 --> 01:52:44,830
Like how did that happen?

3914
01:52:45,770 --> 01:52:46,100
But

3915
01:52:46,100 --> 01:52:46,300
uh,

3916
01:52:46,300 --> 01:52:47,300
on the vibration plate,

3917
01:52:47,330 --> 01:52:48,090
you're of course you're,

3918
01:52:48,090 --> 01:52:52,700
you're burning energy but you're moving
all the lymphatic fluids in the body and

3919
01:52:52,701 --> 01:52:56,630
your micro capillaries are getting
stimulated to like parts of you get shaken

3920
01:52:56,631 --> 01:52:58,310
that might not normally get circulation.

3921
01:52:58,520 --> 01:53:02,160
So you typically feel like a burst of
energy when you're done with it and you,

3922
01:53:02,170 --> 01:53:03,230
you tend to slim down.

3923
01:53:03,231 --> 01:53:05,600
Like I noticed like especially if
you have inflammation going on,

3924
01:53:05,900 --> 01:53:06,381
I'm still,

3925
01:53:06,381 --> 01:53:07,550
because of my health background,

3926
01:53:07,551 --> 01:53:08,090
I still,

3927
01:53:08,090 --> 01:53:08,691
I get inflamed.

3928
01:53:08,691 --> 01:53:09,471
He's ate the wrong stuff.

3929
01:53:09,471 --> 01:53:10,304
I puff up,

3930
01:53:10,370 --> 01:53:12,710
you do that and it helps you
to dump the extra inflammation.

3931
01:53:12,711 --> 01:53:17,711
So it's amazing detox plus exercise plus
general stimulation of your body all at

3932
01:53:18,231 --> 01:53:18,531
once.

3933
01:53:18,531 --> 01:53:19,700
Like for 15 minutes a day.

3934
01:53:19,720 --> 01:53:20,250
It's,

3935
01:53:20,250 --> 01:53:23,090
it's a total bargain just
in terms of time spent,

3936
01:53:23,091 --> 01:53:25,550
whether it's on a turbo sonic
or or the bulletproof vibe,

3937
01:53:25,580 --> 01:53:26,330
they,

3938
01:53:26,330 --> 01:53:27,890
they both achieve the same kind of goals,

3939
01:53:27,891 --> 01:53:31,190
but I'll tell you flat out you've got
the Cadillac or the Mercedes of them,

3940
01:53:31,191 --> 01:53:32,810
the turbo sonic to the best made anywhere.

3941
01:53:32,840 --> 01:53:33,040
Yeah,

3942
01:53:33,040 --> 01:53:35,600
I do 10 minutes of it before a workout.

3943
01:53:35,630 --> 01:53:35,990
Yeah.

3944
01:53:35,990 --> 01:53:37,880
I'll do a 10 minute like shakedown.

3945
01:53:37,910 --> 01:53:38,800
Like you really look at it.

3946
01:53:38,801 --> 01:53:39,381
It feels good,

3947
01:53:39,381 --> 01:53:39,620
doesn't it?

3948
01:53:39,620 --> 01:53:40,220
It feels amazing.

3949
01:53:40,220 --> 01:53:41,120
I love that feeling.

3950
01:53:41,360 --> 01:53:41,931
It's amazing.

3951
01:53:41,931 --> 01:53:42,764
And then when it really,

3952
01:53:43,610 --> 01:53:46,460
what's really going fast for folks
who've never tried it before,

3953
01:53:46,490 --> 01:53:47,000
if you,

3954
01:53:47,000 --> 01:53:48,200
if you're anywhere near Venice,

3955
01:53:48,201 --> 01:53:48,471
whoops,

3956
01:53:48,471 --> 01:53:49,880
I lost one of my fucking Frankenstein.

3957
01:53:49,881 --> 01:53:50,714
No lobes.

3958
01:53:51,080 --> 01:53:52,370
If you're anywhere near Venice,

3959
01:53:52,850 --> 01:53:54,140
the float lab has it.

3960
01:53:54,820 --> 01:53:56,480
Crash is the one who sold me mine.

3961
01:53:56,720 --> 01:53:58,820
He's the fucking mad scientists,

3962
01:53:58,821 --> 01:54:01,310
ladies and gentlemen to
given me an updated tank.

3963
01:54:01,311 --> 01:54:02,001
Ladies and gentleman,

3964
01:54:02,001 --> 01:54:02,691
there's a new tank.

3965
01:54:02,691 --> 01:54:03,650
Did crash is created.

3966
01:54:03,840 --> 01:54:05,600
It's even though he's a mad scientist,

3967
01:54:05,601 --> 01:54:06,740
he's a crazy man,

3968
01:54:06,890 --> 01:54:07,670
but he uh,

3969
01:54:07,670 --> 01:54:08,900
he runs the float lab,

3970
01:54:08,930 --> 01:54:11,090
the best isolation tanks
bar none in the world.

3971
01:54:11,150 --> 01:54:11,920
I might get one.

3972
01:54:11,920 --> 01:54:12,170
I'm,

3973
01:54:12,170 --> 01:54:13,040
I'm looking at one.

3974
01:54:13,230 --> 01:54:14,450
How the fuck do you not have one?

3975
01:54:14,451 --> 01:54:15,380
I've been looking at building one,

3976
01:54:15,381 --> 01:54:18,470
but because I moved up to BC a couple
of years ago and look at it by a ranch.

3977
01:54:18,500 --> 01:54:19,400
So as soon as I get the ranch,

3978
01:54:19,401 --> 01:54:20,121
I'm getting a good tank,

3979
01:54:20,121 --> 01:54:21,830
but I don't want to move it into
the place where I'm living now.

3980
01:54:21,831 --> 01:54:23,210
You should have it right in this crash.

3981
01:54:23,211 --> 01:54:24,530
We'll set it up and do everything for you.

3982
01:54:24,590 --> 01:54:25,910
You should have one right now.

3983
01:54:25,911 --> 01:54:26,870
Especially you.

3984
01:54:27,020 --> 01:54:28,010
How many times have you used,

3985
01:54:28,011 --> 01:54:28,091
well,

3986
01:54:28,091 --> 01:54:29,270
I've used the float tank once,

3987
01:54:29,271 --> 01:54:30,440
like 10 years ago.

3988
01:54:30,500 --> 01:54:32,000
Dare you sir?

3989
01:54:32,330 --> 01:54:34,520
Hooking up these fucking
electrodes to your brain.

3990
01:54:34,521 --> 01:54:37,370
You're not even taking advantage
of one of the craziest pieces of,

3991
01:54:37,390 --> 01:54:37,510
Oh,

3992
01:54:37,510 --> 01:54:38,740
I have machine I love.

3993
01:54:38,741 --> 01:54:39,800
So I love it.

3994
01:54:39,801 --> 01:54:41,040
It's a huge thing.

3995
01:54:41,041 --> 01:54:41,870
You only did it once.

3996
01:54:41,870 --> 01:54:42,480
I only did it once.

3997
01:54:42,480 --> 01:54:43,760
It's a question of where you live,

3998
01:54:43,761 --> 01:54:44,150
right?

3999
01:54:44,150 --> 01:54:45,740
If there's not a float tank area and yeah,

4000
01:54:45,741 --> 01:54:46,040
it,

4001
01:54:46,040 --> 01:54:46,701
it's on my list.

4002
01:54:46,701 --> 01:54:47,690
Not for me it wasn't.

4003
01:54:47,720 --> 01:54:52,400
I did it once and I was looking to buy
a house and one of the prerequisites for

4004
01:54:52,401 --> 01:54:54,090
buying the house was
having a room for the tank.

4005
01:54:54,350 --> 01:54:54,670
My,

4006
01:54:54,670 --> 01:54:55,850
the House I'm looking to buy right now,

4007
01:54:55,851 --> 01:54:56,301
same thing.

4008
01:54:56,301 --> 01:54:57,200
It's got to have space.

4009
01:54:57,290 --> 01:54:58,850
I have to have space for a pool table.

4010
01:54:58,880 --> 01:55:01,730
I have to have space for the
tank that's non negotiable.

4011
01:55:01,920 --> 01:55:03,740
Everything else I can
lift weights at the gym,

4012
01:55:03,950 --> 01:55:05,120
but they need a tank in the house.

4013
01:55:05,350 --> 01:55:06,410
It's hard to find a tank,

4014
01:55:06,440 --> 01:55:06,711
you know,

4015
01:55:06,711 --> 01:55:07,850
if you don't live near Venice.

4016
01:55:08,720 --> 01:55:13,490
The tank for me is something that anyone
who's thinking about improving must

4017
01:55:13,491 --> 01:55:15,470
have for creativity.

4018
01:55:15,471 --> 01:55:16,304
It is.

4019
01:55:16,340 --> 01:55:18,110
It's a fascinating tool,

4020
01:55:18,770 --> 01:55:21,110
self introspective thinking and you know,

4021
01:55:21,111 --> 01:55:21,800
it's just,

4022
01:55:21,800 --> 01:55:22,633
it's amazing.

4023
01:55:22,730 --> 01:55:23,540
In fact,

4024
01:55:23,540 --> 01:55:26,450
it's one of those technologies and there's
a whole bunch of them out there that

4025
01:55:26,540 --> 01:55:28,250
allows the prefrontal Cortex,

4026
01:55:28,251 --> 01:55:32,000
like the human part of your brain that
you think of as you to become aware of

4027
01:55:32,030 --> 01:55:32,421
that,

4028
01:55:32,421 --> 01:55:35,250
that really fast reptilian brain that
runs circles around you like you.

4029
01:55:35,251 --> 01:55:37,910
You can't even see it happening
until you get rid of all the noise.

4030
01:55:38,290 --> 01:55:41,510
And when you get into that flow tank all
of a sudden like you do that personal

4031
01:55:41,511 --> 01:55:42,344
exploration,

4032
01:55:42,500 --> 01:55:43,320
you can,

4033
01:55:43,320 --> 01:55:44,220
you can do amazing

4034
01:55:44,220 --> 01:55:45,030
things there.

4035
01:55:45,030 --> 01:55:48,060
You can do amazing things and you learn
amazing things out about yourself.

4036
01:55:48,100 --> 01:55:51,390
You start making these
drastic improvements in the
way you look at things in

4037
01:55:51,391 --> 01:55:51,780
there.

4038
01:55:51,780 --> 01:55:53,280
Cause it's so self analytical.

4039
01:55:53,281 --> 01:55:53,880
It's so,

4040
01:55:53,880 --> 01:55:56,230
it's so a self observational.

4041
01:55:56,231 --> 01:55:57,360
Then when you're in there you just,

4042
01:55:57,420 --> 01:55:57,931
you're not,

4043
01:55:57,931 --> 01:55:59,250
you don't have anything
going on with your body.

4044
01:55:59,251 --> 01:56:02,370
So you're just alone with your
thoughts and you have to address them.

4045
01:56:02,371 --> 01:56:04,830
You can't get confused and
separated with busy work.

4046
01:56:04,831 --> 01:56:05,280
You just,

4047
01:56:05,280 --> 01:56:05,611
you're,

4048
01:56:05,611 --> 01:56:09,120
you're not going to within 20 minutes
anything that's really fucking with you.

4049
01:56:09,121 --> 01:56:10,050
We'll come to the surface.

4050
01:56:10,320 --> 01:56:11,730
Have you ever played with neurofeedback?

4051
01:56:12,090 --> 01:56:12,780
What does that,

4052
01:56:12,780 --> 01:56:15,600
this is when you hook electrodes up to
your head and you get the signal from

4053
01:56:15,601 --> 01:56:16,434
your brain,

4054
01:56:16,540 --> 01:56:16,830
oh,

4055
01:56:16,830 --> 01:56:18,150
this is profound stuff.

4056
01:56:18,151 --> 01:56:18,271
It,

4057
01:56:18,271 --> 01:56:19,530
it's on par with a float tank.

4058
01:56:19,531 --> 01:56:19,861
In fact,

4059
01:56:19,861 --> 01:56:21,960
I've had my own EEG since 1998.

4060
01:56:21,990 --> 01:56:22,680
Whoa.

4061
01:56:22,680 --> 01:56:23,250
Um,

4062
01:56:23,250 --> 01:56:27,650
be like at home because it's that
impactful and what you do there is,

4063
01:56:27,651 --> 01:56:28,484
is your brain,

4064
01:56:28,890 --> 01:56:31,140
it's unable to see itself.

4065
01:56:31,141 --> 01:56:32,700
Like your brand can see
the whole world around you,

4066
01:56:32,701 --> 01:56:34,440
but it doesn't have nerves inside itself.

4067
01:56:34,470 --> 01:56:35,640
That's why I like you see brand surgery,

4068
01:56:35,641 --> 01:56:38,220
they can take the top off your head and
like poke at your brain and it doesn't

4069
01:56:38,221 --> 01:56:38,640
hurt.

4070
01:56:38,640 --> 01:56:39,473
There's no nerves in there.

4071
01:56:39,630 --> 01:56:40,381
There's nurses in your arm,

4072
01:56:40,381 --> 01:56:41,220
like you cut your arm.

4073
01:56:41,730 --> 01:56:43,020
Then what's going to happen is,

4074
01:56:43,050 --> 01:56:43,201
well,

4075
01:56:43,201 --> 01:56:45,600
there's nerves there and in the
arm heals relatively quickly.

4076
01:56:45,780 --> 01:56:47,010
We get these traumatic brain injuries.

4077
01:56:47,010 --> 01:56:49,260
They don't heal very well because the
brain doesn't even know what's broken.

4078
01:56:49,280 --> 01:56:51,450
So it's incredibly good at the world,

4079
01:56:51,460 --> 01:56:52,710
incredibly bad at itself.

4080
01:56:53,220 --> 01:56:55,620
So what you do is you get
the signal from the brain,

4081
01:56:55,650 --> 01:56:56,850
you'd play it through an amplifier,

4082
01:56:56,851 --> 01:56:58,950
it turns it into music and it
plays the music back to you.

4083
01:56:59,310 --> 01:57:01,170
And when you think about something
in the music gets louder.

4084
01:57:01,230 --> 01:57:02,660
When you think about something else,

4085
01:57:02,720 --> 01:57:03,553
music gets quieter.

4086
01:57:04,530 --> 01:57:07,620
So you can teach the brain
to think in a new way.

4087
01:57:07,920 --> 01:57:11,520
So I've done an extensive neurofeedback
training and literally seven days was

4088
01:57:11,521 --> 01:57:13,920
the equivalent of 40 years
of daily zen practice.

4089
01:57:14,290 --> 01:57:15,123
This was really,

4090
01:57:15,420 --> 01:57:16,890
really hardcore intense seven days.

4091
01:57:16,891 --> 01:57:18,090
It was like a hardest
thing I've ever done.

4092
01:57:18,091 --> 01:57:22,440
It cost me 20 grand and I was hooked up
to it like an $11 million EEG machine

4093
01:57:22,441 --> 01:57:23,970
for at least half that time.

4094
01:57:24,570 --> 01:57:27,350
But I mean you want to
introspection when you look at a,

4095
01:57:27,420 --> 01:57:28,350
when you hear a sound,

4096
01:57:28,500 --> 01:57:30,720
your brain can't help but optimize itself.

4097
01:57:30,960 --> 01:57:32,640
Like it tells you when
you're doing it wrong.

4098
01:57:32,860 --> 01:57:35,460
You think of like the meditation
path that people are on there.

4099
01:57:35,461 --> 01:57:35,670
Like,

4100
01:57:35,670 --> 01:57:36,503
oh,

4101
01:57:36,540 --> 01:57:37,321
I meditate this way.

4102
01:57:37,321 --> 01:57:38,400
Oh I did it wrong for five years,

4103
01:57:38,401 --> 01:57:38,731
sorry.

4104
01:57:38,731 --> 01:57:40,200
And then they do it over here
and they sort of meander.

4105
01:57:40,201 --> 01:57:41,760
And then you know their
teachers tell them,

4106
01:57:41,761 --> 01:57:42,810
try meditating this way.

4107
01:57:43,260 --> 01:57:46,170
Well what if there was a
computer and it lit up the path.

4108
01:57:46,200 --> 01:57:48,900
So like on either side of the path there's
like letting you know the sounds get

4109
01:57:48,901 --> 01:57:50,010
quiet and either side of the path.

4110
01:57:50,400 --> 01:57:55,400
All of a sudden you can do meditative
type of things to yourself that would take

4111
01:57:56,011 --> 01:57:57,690
you years of focused practice.

4112
01:57:57,840 --> 01:58:01,290
You can do it in days and because
synaptogenesis this part of the brain that

4113
01:58:01,291 --> 01:58:03,960
makes new synapses happens
within like 20 days.

4114
01:58:04,350 --> 01:58:06,810
You can totally rewire your head in short,

4115
01:58:06,811 --> 01:58:07,770
short amounts of time,

4116
01:58:07,950 --> 01:58:09,030
like unbelievably short.

4117
01:58:10,130 --> 01:58:15,130
So you rewire your head by
use of electrical frequencies
so you can literally

4118
01:58:15,231 --> 01:58:18,050
program it to do exactly
what you wanted to do.

4119
01:58:18,260 --> 01:58:18,411
Right?

4120
01:58:18,411 --> 01:58:20,030
But we're not putting the
frequencies into the head.

4121
01:58:20,060 --> 01:58:22,820
All we're doing is we're using like a
mirror because the brain doesn't have any

4122
01:58:22,821 --> 01:58:23,654
nerves inside itself.

4123
01:58:23,660 --> 01:58:25,490
The brain will on its own figure out,

4124
01:58:25,520 --> 01:58:26,353
oh my God,

4125
01:58:26,420 --> 01:58:27,140
that sound,

4126
01:58:27,140 --> 01:58:27,973
that's me.

4127
01:58:28,010 --> 01:58:30,770
And it'll start doing things
to like adjust how it works.

4128
01:58:30,860 --> 01:58:34,160
It's like for things like add people
who have like been hit on the head,

4129
01:58:34,400 --> 01:58:35,091
these guys,

4130
01:58:35,091 --> 01:58:35,430
they,

4131
01:58:35,430 --> 01:58:37,550
they get improved very dramatically.

4132
01:58:37,850 --> 01:58:40,850
But the kind I did is
correlated with a 12 IQ point,

4133
01:58:40,870 --> 01:58:42,160
boost that stable year later

4134
01:58:42,160 --> 01:58:43,750
and like 50% more creativity.

4135
01:58:43,990 --> 01:58:44,830
Wow.

4136
01:58:44,950 --> 01:58:45,430
Amazing.

4137
01:58:45,430 --> 01:58:45,911
Wait a minute.

4138
01:58:45,911 --> 01:58:46,271
Wait a minute.

4139
01:58:46,271 --> 01:58:46,601
Wait a minute.

4140
01:58:46,601 --> 01:58:46,961
Wait a minute.

4141
01:58:46,961 --> 01:58:47,351
Wait a minute.

4142
01:58:47,351 --> 01:58:47,711
Wait a minute.

4143
01:58:47,711 --> 01:58:48,101
Wait a minute.

4144
01:58:48,101 --> 01:58:48,934
Wait a minute.

4145
01:58:48,970 --> 01:58:49,660
What do we have to do?

4146
01:58:49,660 --> 01:58:50,560
How do I get it on this?

4147
01:58:50,590 --> 01:58:51,010
Um,

4148
01:58:51,010 --> 01:58:52,690
well I will,

4149
01:58:52,691 --> 01:58:52,900
uh,

4150
01:58:52,900 --> 01:58:53,950
I'll hook you up with a guy who does it.

4151
01:58:53,951 --> 01:58:55,090
He runs a private facility.

4152
01:58:55,120 --> 01:58:55,953
How much time?

4153
01:58:56,230 --> 01:58:59,900
It takes seven full days and takes
15 grand plus travel expenses.

4154
01:58:59,910 --> 01:59:01,180
Sounds like I'm getting robbed.

4155
01:59:01,260 --> 01:59:01,451
It's,

4156
01:59:01,451 --> 01:59:04,660
is it behind a seven 11 nonsense.

4157
01:59:04,980 --> 01:59:05,340
The Guy,

4158
01:59:05,340 --> 01:59:05,990
the guys in

4159
01:59:05,990 --> 01:59:06,410
ex,

4160
01:59:06,410 --> 01:59:06,920
uh,

4161
01:59:06,920 --> 01:59:08,900
he's an ex faculty member from UCS staff.

4162
01:59:09,010 --> 01:59:09,180
Yeah.

4163
01:59:09,180 --> 01:59:11,600
He's been doing this for 35 years
and then runs a private facility.

4164
01:59:11,720 --> 01:59:12,031
By the way,

4165
01:59:12,031 --> 01:59:12,860
you're getting robbed.

4166
01:59:12,860 --> 01:59:15,530
This should be available on every street
corner and it should be in every school

4167
01:59:15,531 --> 01:59:17,240
and it should cost about 300 bucks.

4168
01:59:17,270 --> 01:59:18,560
It would transform society.

4169
01:59:18,770 --> 01:59:20,750
The fact that it's 15 grand
pisses me off everyday,

4170
01:59:20,780 --> 01:59:23,810
which is why I'm not telling you his
name right now because shut this website

4171
01:59:23,811 --> 01:59:24,320
down anyway.

4172
01:59:24,320 --> 01:59:24,890
But yeah,

4173
01:59:24,890 --> 01:59:29,060
we will crush you a websites on that
sounds like really for seven days though.

4174
01:59:29,061 --> 01:59:31,760
It actually doesn't sound like a rip
off if it turns into a super genius.

4175
01:59:31,761 --> 01:59:33,320
It sounds like it was.

4176
01:59:33,440 --> 01:59:34,021
I mean I,

4177
01:59:34,021 --> 01:59:35,810
I'd already done a lot of work on myself,

4178
01:59:36,260 --> 01:59:40,010
but I came out of there and like
the voice in your head that,

4179
01:59:40,011 --> 01:59:41,300
that thing that gets in your way,

4180
01:59:41,570 --> 01:59:43,250
like it's your bitch when you're done.

4181
01:59:43,250 --> 01:59:47,660
Like that's so you can go there and it
just completely rewires your brain in

4182
01:59:47,661 --> 01:59:48,494
seven days.

4183
01:59:48,500 --> 01:59:49,340
It is hard work.

4184
01:59:49,341 --> 01:59:49,980
Don't get me wrong.

4185
01:59:49,980 --> 01:59:51,180
You have to do what is the hardware.

4186
01:59:51,260 --> 01:59:54,320
You sit there in a dark room with a
speaker on either side of your head and

4187
01:59:54,321 --> 01:59:56,600
eight electrodes glued to
your head and then you,

4188
01:59:56,770 --> 01:59:59,240
you do whatever you have to do to make
the sound louder and make your score go

4189
01:59:59,241 --> 01:59:59,840
higher.

4190
01:59:59,840 --> 02:00:02,540
And the first three days you just
like your brain just doing his thing.

4191
02:00:02,541 --> 02:00:04,770
And then after that you have
to dig in on like you're,

4192
02:00:04,790 --> 02:00:05,900
you're most like,

4193
02:00:05,930 --> 02:00:06,950
it's just like in a float tank.

4194
02:00:07,010 --> 02:00:08,010
My ultimate fantasy,

4195
02:00:08,011 --> 02:00:11,480
it would be that I'd go there and I'm
like a super gifted at this and I break

4196
02:00:11,481 --> 02:00:12,314
the whole,

4197
02:00:16,110 --> 02:00:16,591
we're getting,

4198
02:00:16,591 --> 02:00:17,730
we're getting to that point.

4199
02:00:17,731 --> 02:00:18,564
So we didn't do this.

4200
02:00:18,870 --> 02:00:19,800
I want you to do this.

4201
02:00:19,830 --> 02:00:22,320
I think it's not going to judge all.

4202
02:00:22,321 --> 02:00:22,921
I'll do it with you.

4203
02:00:22,921 --> 02:00:23,970
I've actually been
thinking about going back.

4204
02:00:24,620 --> 02:00:26,030
Can you lay on top of each other women?

4205
02:00:26,200 --> 02:00:29,610
Can you get the super would if she would
like a fucking intellectual vampire now

4206
02:00:29,611 --> 02:00:30,870
get dumber and you get smarter.

4207
02:00:31,340 --> 02:00:32,173
Um,

4208
02:00:32,430 --> 02:00:33,263
what if he hacks?

4209
02:00:33,340 --> 02:00:34,250
That's what he's trying to do.

4210
02:00:35,260 --> 02:00:36,001
I'd like to remind you,

4211
02:00:36,001 --> 02:00:37,590
you've gotten my electrodes
on your forehead right now.

4212
02:00:37,591 --> 02:00:38,490
It's already been done

4213
02:00:40,520 --> 02:00:41,400
to bill this shit,

4214
02:00:41,401 --> 02:00:42,234
son.

4215
02:00:42,360 --> 02:00:44,340
You got to meet some little
stronger for this fat head.

4216
02:00:44,500 --> 02:00:45,151
What is this thing?

4217
02:00:45,151 --> 02:00:48,420
I think I saw it on your Twitter
about you paying to get hacked.

4218
02:00:48,421 --> 02:00:49,550
What was that all about?

4219
02:00:49,570 --> 02:00:50,700
Paying for what?

4220
02:00:50,880 --> 02:00:51,360
Maybe it,

4221
02:00:51,360 --> 02:00:51,840
hold on.

4222
02:00:51,840 --> 02:00:52,370
Nevermind

4223
02:00:52,370 --> 02:00:53,580
mean biohacking.

4224
02:00:53,750 --> 02:00:55,870
How much you spent biohack
the quarter million dollars.

4225
02:00:56,340 --> 02:00:56,570
Yeah.

4226
02:00:56,570 --> 02:00:56,841
Okay.

4227
02:00:56,841 --> 02:00:58,280
So over the past 15 years,

4228
02:00:58,281 --> 02:01:01,730
I've spent a quarter million dollars on
everything I can think of that improves

4229
02:01:01,731 --> 02:01:02,564
human performance.

4230
02:01:02,780 --> 02:01:03,140
I'm like,

4231
02:01:03,140 --> 02:01:03,980
I'm just going to do it.

4232
02:01:04,250 --> 02:01:04,990
So,

4233
02:01:04,990 --> 02:01:05,360
um,

4234
02:01:05,360 --> 02:01:06,111
20 grand.

4235
02:01:06,111 --> 02:01:07,310
Actually I did it a couple times.

4236
02:01:07,880 --> 02:01:09,860
So 20 grand in 25 grand,

4237
02:01:09,861 --> 02:01:10,694
whatever there.

4238
02:01:10,710 --> 02:01:11,120
Um,

4239
02:01:11,120 --> 02:01:14,630
I've taken ungodly numbers of
supplements and smart drugs.

4240
02:01:14,950 --> 02:01:16,520
I've tried all kinds of electronics.

4241
02:01:16,540 --> 02:01:18,920
I have like a whole mad
biohacker laboratory at home.

4242
02:01:19,220 --> 02:01:21,140
Like I've gotten my vibrating plate.

4243
02:01:21,141 --> 02:01:22,670
I've got an ozone generator.

4244
02:01:22,960 --> 02:01:27,960
I've got a couple different EEG machine
zone generator in my tank set up because

4245
02:01:28,131 --> 02:01:28,964
of crashed uses.

4246
02:01:29,090 --> 02:01:29,930
Purify the water.

4247
02:01:29,960 --> 02:01:31,340
That's the best way to purify water.

4248
02:01:31,370 --> 02:01:32,270
Powerful crush.

4249
02:01:32,760 --> 02:01:33,121
Are you,

4250
02:01:33,121 --> 02:01:38,121
are you sponsored by grass to pay for
all this Scott Industries or something?

4251
02:01:39,000 --> 02:01:40,040
Actually BC bud.

4252
02:01:40,120 --> 02:01:40,953
That's fine.

4253
02:01:42,770 --> 02:01:44,330
Have you ever looked into eating cannabis?

4254
02:01:44,640 --> 02:01:45,140
Um,

4255
02:01:45,140 --> 02:01:45,621
as a,

4256
02:01:45,621 --> 02:01:46,220
as a food?

4257
02:01:46,220 --> 02:01:46,790
Yeah.

4258
02:01:46,790 --> 02:01:47,510
Um,

4259
02:01:47,510 --> 02:01:48,620
I've looked at eating hemp,

4260
02:01:48,621 --> 02:01:48,980
not,

4261
02:01:48,980 --> 02:01:50,810
you mean you didn't have actual cannabis?

4262
02:01:50,840 --> 02:01:52,430
Cannabis is when you don't cook it.

4263
02:01:52,431 --> 02:01:53,420
It's not psychoactive.

4264
02:01:53,850 --> 02:01:54,330
Eat it.

4265
02:01:54,330 --> 02:01:56,960
The psychoactive plants of cannabis.

4266
02:01:56,961 --> 02:01:58,700
If you eat it does not make you high.

4267
02:01:58,720 --> 02:01:59,553
It just just by,

4268
02:01:59,570 --> 02:02:00,740
but it's incredibly healthy.

4269
02:02:01,010 --> 02:02:01,140
Oh,

4270
02:02:01,140 --> 02:02:01,550
interesting.

4271
02:02:01,550 --> 02:02:02,210
Beneficial.

4272
02:02:02,210 --> 02:02:02,630
Yeah.

4273
02:02:02,630 --> 02:02:03,440
And that's supposed to,

4274
02:02:03,440 --> 02:02:05,270
I've never tried it but
it sounds kind of cool.

4275
02:02:05,271 --> 02:02:08,360
It's supposed to be really great
to juice as well and interesting.

4276
02:02:08,390 --> 02:02:09,470
That's really cool.

4277
02:02:09,560 --> 02:02:09,771
Well,

4278
02:02:09,771 --> 02:02:10,461
if it was legal,

4279
02:02:10,461 --> 02:02:14,000
it'd be so easy and cheap to grow that
you could literally eat it that way for

4280
02:02:14,001 --> 02:02:14,600
health,

4281
02:02:14,600 --> 02:02:15,350
smoke it,

4282
02:02:15,350 --> 02:02:16,120
do whatever you want.

4283
02:02:16,120 --> 02:02:17,150
You wouldn't be such a,

4284
02:02:17,360 --> 02:02:19,460
the reason why it's such a
commodity is because it's illegal.

4285
02:02:20,090 --> 02:02:20,923
It's ridiculous.

4286
02:02:21,230 --> 02:02:24,410
You could throw seeds out the window
mean it's famous people who have been

4287
02:02:24,411 --> 02:02:25,101
driving their car,

4288
02:02:25,101 --> 02:02:26,150
they throw joints out the window,

4289
02:02:26,151 --> 02:02:29,510
they drive by six months later as a
fucking giant push of marijuana growing

4290
02:02:29,511 --> 02:02:30,020
there.

4291
02:02:30,020 --> 02:02:32,080
I mean it really is a
super hardy plant and,

4292
02:02:32,110 --> 02:02:34,730
and like the protein in
there is really high in Igg.

4293
02:02:34,790 --> 02:02:36,080
It's great protein.

4294
02:02:36,590 --> 02:02:38,300
It's a bit high in Omega six fats.

4295
02:02:38,680 --> 02:02:39,260
Um,

4296
02:02:39,260 --> 02:02:40,550
if it's all you're going to eat,

4297
02:02:40,790 --> 02:02:42,080
but certainly some of it,

4298
02:02:42,081 --> 02:02:42,711
it's fine.

4299
02:02:42,711 --> 02:02:43,000
But,

4300
02:02:43,000 --> 02:02:43,910
but if you get those protein,

4301
02:02:43,911 --> 02:02:44,770
it's one of effect.

4302
02:02:44,840 --> 02:02:47,090
I would say it's the best plant
source protein that I know of.

4303
02:02:47,250 --> 02:02:47,470
Yeah.

4304
02:02:47,470 --> 02:02:48,081
You can need a plan.

4305
02:02:48,081 --> 02:02:48,221
Sorry.

4306
02:02:48,221 --> 02:02:49,670
It's very digestible to,

4307
02:02:49,700 --> 02:02:53,060
that's my favorite part of it is that
it's the one of the few things hemp with

4308
02:02:53,061 --> 02:02:55,370
coconut juice and coconut oil,

4309
02:02:55,550 --> 02:02:56,000
but uh,

4310
02:02:56,000 --> 02:02:59,870
I use it with a c two oh baby see two oh
coconut juice because it is my favorite

4311
02:02:59,871 --> 02:03:00,770
if I can get raw.

4312
02:03:01,070 --> 02:03:01,791
Raw is Roz,

4313
02:03:01,791 --> 02:03:02,150
awesome.

4314
02:03:02,150 --> 02:03:02,511
Ross,

4315
02:03:02,511 --> 02:03:05,060
tough to fuck with if you can get robbed
but it only lasts for like a little

4316
02:03:05,061 --> 02:03:05,440
while.

4317
02:03:05,440 --> 02:03:06,273
It's the best.

4318
02:03:06,320 --> 02:03:07,950
You can't really keep it
in the fridge like you can,

4319
02:03:08,010 --> 02:03:12,290
but that damn stuff and force
protein part of the stuff that I use.

4320
02:03:12,350 --> 02:03:12,480
Yeah,

4321
02:03:12,480 --> 02:03:12,950
you could,

4322
02:03:12,950 --> 02:03:15,500
you could take it and go to the gym and
hour later it's the only thing that I

4323
02:03:15,501 --> 02:03:19,090
could do Jujitsu and an hour later
because it's so easy for your body digest.

4324
02:03:19,091 --> 02:03:20,870
It's just not taxing at all.

4325
02:03:21,320 --> 02:03:22,071
The stuff we use.

4326
02:03:22,071 --> 02:03:26,840
Two is the most expensive because it has
the highest ratio of protein to like to

4327
02:03:26,841 --> 02:03:29,840
like some of our more course
of the hearts are more course.

4328
02:03:29,841 --> 02:03:31,160
They don't have as high a ratio.

4329
02:03:31,270 --> 02:03:32,330
That's what you want to do.

4330
02:03:32,630 --> 02:03:33,260
Yeah.

4331
02:03:33,260 --> 02:03:33,561
Yeah.

4332
02:03:33,561 --> 02:03:34,090
It's uh,

4333
02:03:34,090 --> 02:03:39,090
it's really super easily digestible but
illegal to grow but not illegal to have

4334
02:03:40,041 --> 02:03:40,874
or sal,

4335
02:03:40,920 --> 02:03:41,350
so like,

4336
02:03:41,350 --> 02:03:41,840
like legal.

4337
02:03:41,840 --> 02:03:42,673
Thank you Canada,

4338
02:03:43,140 --> 02:03:46,820
the United States for fucking saying
that it's illegal to grow a plant.

4339
02:03:48,270 --> 02:03:49,790
Dunces it's just such,

4340
02:03:50,160 --> 02:03:50,661
you know,

4341
02:03:50,661 --> 02:03:51,500
we add on it.

4342
02:03:51,500 --> 02:03:54,740
We could have had a farm we were
thinking about like Vermont,

4343
02:03:54,741 --> 02:03:56,840
we looked into Vermont
because Vermont passed laws,

4344
02:03:57,200 --> 02:03:59,090
but the federal government
is clearly said,

4345
02:03:59,091 --> 02:04:01,370
we will lock you in jail if
you try to grow this plant.

4346
02:04:01,430 --> 02:04:01,790
Here's,

4347
02:04:01,790 --> 02:04:02,780
here's how to get past all of this.

4348
02:04:02,781 --> 02:04:03,614
I just figured it out.

4349
02:04:03,680 --> 02:04:03,980
Oh,

4350
02:04:03,980 --> 02:04:07,310
Monsanto needs to make
genetically modified pot and
then it'll be legal to grow

4351
02:04:07,311 --> 02:04:08,144
everywhere.

4352
02:04:08,210 --> 02:04:08,660
Listen.

4353
02:04:08,660 --> 02:04:08,901
Yeah.

4354
02:04:08,901 --> 02:04:11,960
But then they'll probably fuck with
a pot and the pot transmit Nazi,

4355
02:04:12,070 --> 02:04:13,280
turn you into an octopus or something.

4356
02:04:13,281 --> 02:04:13,610
Yeah.

4357
02:04:13,610 --> 02:04:14,780
It's going to do something to you.

4358
02:04:14,781 --> 02:04:15,680
It's going to ruin you.

4359
02:04:15,860 --> 02:04:18,040
I hope they don't do that and
case anyone there's listening.

4360
02:04:18,041 --> 02:04:18,150
Yeah,

4361
02:04:18,150 --> 02:04:18,441
please.

4362
02:04:18,441 --> 02:04:19,310
Monsanto leave.

4363
02:04:19,311 --> 02:04:23,330
We'd alone concentrate on sweet potatoes
or whatever the fuck you're doing.

4364
02:04:23,720 --> 02:04:25,200
It's this scary ass company,

4365
02:04:25,201 --> 02:04:25,580
man.

4366
02:04:25,580 --> 02:04:27,440
Somebody needs to get those
people some mushrooms.

4367
02:04:27,800 --> 02:04:28,430
Amen.

4368
02:04:28,430 --> 02:04:31,540
Get those people some mushrooms and
understand the impact of your decisions.

4369
02:04:31,550 --> 02:04:33,110
Just to put ones and Zeros.

4370
02:04:33,190 --> 02:04:35,990
There's some serious therapeutic
value to medicinal mushrooms.

4371
02:04:36,050 --> 02:04:36,883
Oh fuck yeah.

4372
02:04:37,230 --> 02:04:40,530
That's John Hopkins University showed
significant improvements in people's

4373
02:04:40,531 --> 02:04:42,000
personalities years later.

4374
02:04:42,900 --> 02:04:43,290
How many,

4375
02:04:43,290 --> 02:04:46,040
how many kilobytes is Joe's
brain being downloaded like,

4376
02:04:46,380 --> 02:04:49,320
like that's like a 32 megabyte
file are pretty smart right now.

4377
02:04:49,321 --> 02:04:49,591
Brian,

4378
02:04:49,591 --> 02:04:49,861
I know he's,

4379
02:04:49,861 --> 02:04:50,551
he's taking,

4380
02:04:50,551 --> 02:04:53,130
he just copied and pasted parents.

4381
02:04:53,340 --> 02:04:53,850
Yeah.

4382
02:04:53,850 --> 02:04:56,670
I don't even know what my own memories
or I'm actually on my iPad here.

4383
02:04:56,671 --> 02:04:59,220
I'm looking at what he's
thinking about and I feel dirty,

4384
02:04:59,860 --> 02:05:00,693
dirty,

4385
02:05:01,330 --> 02:05:02,300
not black hawks.

4386
02:05:02,340 --> 02:05:03,173
And that's your,

4387
02:05:03,550 --> 02:05:04,770
that's a flashback.

4388
02:05:05,550 --> 02:05:06,990
Flashback to the past sun.

4389
02:05:07,170 --> 02:05:08,003
How dare you.

4390
02:05:08,370 --> 02:05:09,203
How dare you.

4391
02:05:09,300 --> 02:05:10,680
Are you feeling anything
from the electrodes?

4392
02:05:10,770 --> 02:05:10,980
Um,

4393
02:05:10,980 --> 02:05:11,490
I don't know.

4394
02:05:11,490 --> 02:05:11,890
You know,

4395
02:05:11,890 --> 02:05:13,440
it's hard to say and I'll feel bad.

4396
02:05:13,490 --> 02:05:14,790
It gives me a pretty subtle and just,

4397
02:05:14,791 --> 02:05:15,121
you know,

4398
02:05:15,121 --> 02:05:17,460
see if you're in the zone one more
for the next few hours after this.

4399
02:05:17,520 --> 02:05:17,761
Yeah,

4400
02:05:17,761 --> 02:05:18,300
I think it's,

4401
02:05:18,300 --> 02:05:19,170
it feels cool.

4402
02:05:19,260 --> 02:05:19,770
I like it.

4403
02:05:19,770 --> 02:05:21,990
I liked the fact that I think
it does something for me.

4404
02:05:22,170 --> 02:05:24,960
But this other thing just
fucking seven day jammy.

4405
02:05:25,230 --> 02:05:25,861
That sounds,

4406
02:05:25,861 --> 02:05:26,250
uh,

4407
02:05:26,250 --> 02:05:27,083
how many hours a day?

4408
02:05:27,660 --> 02:05:28,111
Pretty much.

4409
02:05:28,111 --> 02:05:28,770
Most of them,

4410
02:05:28,770 --> 02:05:29,130
like,

4411
02:05:29,130 --> 02:05:29,581
like you,

4412
02:05:29,581 --> 02:05:30,151
when you get there,

4413
02:05:30,151 --> 02:05:33,990
you check in your watch and your cell
phone and you just like do it until you're

4414
02:05:33,991 --> 02:05:34,570
done.

4415
02:05:34,570 --> 02:05:36,210
You don't even pay attention to the time.

4416
02:05:36,211 --> 02:05:37,830
Like it's just like time goes away.

4417
02:05:37,831 --> 02:05:39,360
And all your folks who have done this,

4418
02:05:39,480 --> 02:05:40,260
10,000,

4419
02:05:40,260 --> 02:05:42,940
10,000 people have done this and
they've all reported similar results.

4420
02:05:43,060 --> 02:05:45,720
Army special forces had this sky
train them for seven months straight.

4421
02:05:45,810 --> 02:05:47,430
So it's like a Jason Bourne type thing.

4422
02:05:48,240 --> 02:05:48,870
Really.

4423
02:05:48,870 --> 02:05:53,400
So there's a way you can go and you sit
down in this fucking place for seven

4424
02:05:53,401 --> 02:05:56,130
days and this is a permanent change
in your Iq and your creativity.

4425
02:05:56,160 --> 02:05:56,580
Yup.

4426
02:05:56,580 --> 02:05:57,830
That's started kickstarted for you,

4427
02:05:57,831 --> 02:05:58,021
Joe.

4428
02:05:58,021 --> 02:05:59,400
We're going to make a movie about this

4429
02:06:01,150 --> 02:06:01,983
bitch.

4430
02:06:02,820 --> 02:06:03,390
I don't need,

4431
02:06:03,390 --> 02:06:04,230
I don't need that man.

4432
02:06:04,830 --> 02:06:05,341
I'm telling you,

4433
02:06:05,341 --> 02:06:05,670
man,

4434
02:06:05,670 --> 02:06:07,320
it for you.

4435
02:06:07,321 --> 02:06:08,310
You're talking about like,

4436
02:06:08,311 --> 02:06:08,920
you know,

4437
02:06:08,920 --> 02:06:09,860
add,

4438
02:06:10,040 --> 02:06:10,470
uh,

4439
02:06:10,470 --> 02:06:10,780
you know,

4440
02:06:10,780 --> 02:06:11,970
just like kind of have in your brain,

4441
02:06:11,971 --> 02:06:12,511
that's a comedian.

4442
02:06:12,511 --> 02:06:13,410
Brands all over the place.

4443
02:06:13,820 --> 02:06:15,300
You don't lose any of that creativity,

4444
02:06:15,301 --> 02:06:17,550
but it becomes malleable for you.

4445
02:06:17,570 --> 02:06:18,350
And like my,

4446
02:06:18,350 --> 02:06:19,081
my performance,

4447
02:06:19,081 --> 02:06:22,410
I did this in like 2008 or 2007,

4448
02:06:22,780 --> 02:06:23,090
I think.

4449
02:06:23,090 --> 02:06:23,730
2000.

4450
02:06:23,730 --> 02:06:24,563
No.

4451
02:06:24,570 --> 02:06:25,040
Anyway,

4452
02:06:25,040 --> 02:06:25,873
mid two thousands.

4453
02:06:26,170 --> 02:06:26,740
Um,

4454
02:06:26,740 --> 02:06:27,600
and I dunno,

4455
02:06:27,610 --> 02:06:28,443
like I came back,

4456
02:06:29,490 --> 02:06:30,360
I drive fast.

4457
02:06:30,361 --> 02:06:31,410
I've always driven fast.

4458
02:06:31,411 --> 02:06:32,730
I'm a very safe driver,

4459
02:06:33,240 --> 02:06:35,520
but when someone in a Prius cuts me off,

4460
02:06:35,550 --> 02:06:36,570
it pisses me off.

4461
02:06:36,600 --> 02:06:36,781
Right?

4462
02:06:36,781 --> 02:06:38,130
And it's always the
priestesses of cut you off.

4463
02:06:38,490 --> 02:06:39,031
So you know,

4464
02:06:39,031 --> 02:06:40,890
like you son of a bitch and
when I've dealt with this,

4465
02:06:41,040 --> 02:06:41,620
I came back,

4466
02:06:41,620 --> 02:06:41,881
I'm like,

4467
02:06:41,881 --> 02:06:42,470
oh,

4468
02:06:42,470 --> 02:06:43,440
it's one of the priests cut me off,

4469
02:06:43,441 --> 02:06:45,990
but zero emotional like costs.

4470
02:06:46,170 --> 02:06:47,640
All the energy that I used to waste on,

4471
02:06:47,641 --> 02:06:51,810
like getting pissed off about stuff that
didn't matter completely went back to

4472
02:06:51,811 --> 02:06:53,820
productivity and like
just kicking more ass.

4473
02:06:54,070 --> 02:06:57,510
It's amazing what happens when you just
teach your brain that you're the boss

4474
02:06:57,750 --> 02:07:00,660
and you tell you the little reptile brain
and they're just shut the hell up and

4475
02:07:00,661 --> 02:07:03,780
to do its job to keep you from burning
yourself to death or falling off a cliff,

4476
02:07:03,930 --> 02:07:06,060
but to not be freaking out the
rest of the time for no reason.

4477
02:07:06,120 --> 02:07:08,670
Is it possible to do that without
sitting in a room for seven days?

4478
02:07:08,671 --> 02:07:10,020
Get blasted with sounds.

4479
02:07:10,170 --> 02:07:11,190
You can do.

4480
02:07:11,250 --> 02:07:12,040
Give me some sound.

4481
02:07:12,040 --> 02:07:12,500
Alright,

4482
02:07:12,500 --> 02:07:12,860
give me,

4483
02:07:12,860 --> 02:07:14,140
give me a feel like a simulation.

4484
02:07:14,141 --> 02:07:14,260
Yeah.

4485
02:07:14,260 --> 02:07:15,230
What you think this could be black.

4486
02:07:15,400 --> 02:07:15,790
There you go.

4487
02:07:15,790 --> 02:07:16,510
Something like that.

4488
02:07:16,510 --> 02:07:18,790
It's kind of like that and then
you try and make it louder.
