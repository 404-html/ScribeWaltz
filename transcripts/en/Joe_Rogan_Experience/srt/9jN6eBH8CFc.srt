1
00:00:01,140 --> 00:00:05,250
Three.
Two we need like a digital counter.

2
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:10,620
Three,
two,

3
00:00:11,030 --> 00:00:11,870
one.
Whew.

4
00:00:12,110 --> 00:00:13,580
If you're going to drink that,
Andrew,

5
00:00:13,670 --> 00:00:16,380
be very careful.
It's 270 milligrams of caffeine.

6
00:00:16,410 --> 00:00:17,560
That Ooh,

7
00:00:17,910 --> 00:00:19,210
right.
That'd be donated.

8
00:00:19,250 --> 00:00:20,990
That allowed.
You can have that.

9
00:00:22,060 --> 00:00:26,680
Brendan drank one of those yesterday and
a pot of coffee and have a cup of coffee

10
00:00:26,710 --> 00:00:30,370
and then on top of that he drank a,
what'd he have?

11
00:00:30,371 --> 00:00:32,440
Something?
A venti with a shot of espresso in it

12
00:00:32,441 --> 00:00:36,220
from starbucks with all cha all doing it
while he was fasting.

13
00:00:36,221 --> 00:00:38,890
So a halfway into the podcast,
he starts hurling,

14
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:40,780
runs into the bathroom,
throws up,

15
00:00:40,930 --> 00:00:44,650
then it comes back and then throws up in
a bucket at the end of the podcast.

16
00:00:45,070 --> 00:00:46,990
Literally didn't,
didn't make it out of the room

17
00:00:47,190 --> 00:00:50,240
so they could have had a heated seat if
you had to take a shit.

18
00:00:50,430 --> 00:00:55,070
Yeah,
we have a heat instead of 200 7,270

19
00:00:55,071 --> 00:00:55,930
milligrams.
Yeah.

20
00:00:56,060 --> 00:00:58,910
Caveman coffee.
Nitrogenated it's basically like

21
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:02,000
espresso with nitrogen in it.
It's good stuff.

22
00:01:02,630 --> 00:01:03,770
You get used to it.
Good.

23
00:01:03,771 --> 00:01:05,240
I'll take it before bed.
Yeah,

24
00:01:05,270 --> 00:01:07,100
that's a good move.
You'll have some weird dreams.

25
00:01:07,150 --> 00:01:08,870
All right.
Take Express will before I go to bed.

26
00:01:08,930 --> 00:01:10,670
Andrew,
I'm not used to this clean shaven,

27
00:01:10,671 --> 00:01:11,670
Andrew.
Yeah,

28
00:01:11,730 --> 00:01:13,790
like a different human.
You could sneak up on people.

29
00:01:13,910 --> 00:01:14,900
That's the point,
man.

30
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:17,690
My daughter's about,
oh,

31
00:01:17,691 --> 00:01:19,940
about a year ago,
said they had enough of the beard so it

32
00:01:19,941 --> 00:01:20,470
had to go.

33
00:01:20,470 --> 00:01:22,240
Oh,
when I was a,

34
00:01:22,450 --> 00:01:27,450
well when my daughter was one,
a friend of mine died and we on the

35
00:01:28,211 --> 00:01:29,500
Internet,
we'd all had this guy,

36
00:01:29,530 --> 00:01:32,080
Evan Tanner,
who is a former UFC champion.

37
00:01:32,350 --> 00:01:36,370
And we had decided that we were all
gonna grow beards for him cause he had

38
00:01:36,371 --> 00:01:39,700
this crazy giant beard.
And so a bunch of us on the Internet did

39
00:01:39,701 --> 00:01:41,410
it.
And I just grew this fucking werewolf

40
00:01:41,411 --> 00:01:43,600
beard.
And then it got to a point where I was

41
00:01:43,601 --> 00:01:44,530
like,
you know,

42
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:46,840
it was time was up.
I was going to shave it off.

43
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:50,350
And my daughter had no idea what I
really looked like.

44
00:01:50,380 --> 00:01:52,600
So I shaved my face and she started
screaming.

45
00:01:52,630 --> 00:01:55,210
She thought it was somebody else and she
started crying and I'm like,

46
00:01:55,211 --> 00:01:56,130
touch it.
This is,

47
00:01:56,350 --> 00:01:58,520
this is my normal face.
And then she's confused.

48
00:01:58,521 --> 00:01:59,860
She's like,
I know that voice.

49
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:01,990
Like who are you there?
That's what it looks like.

50
00:02:02,660 --> 00:02:04,790
Oh Nice.
That's a sand a half with my boys.

51
00:02:04,791 --> 00:02:06,410
They were,
they were young too,

52
00:02:06,411 --> 00:02:07,730
like so they had never seen me without
it.

53
00:02:07,731 --> 00:02:12,731
So like they thought you were a stranger
to then you see that that's because

54
00:02:13,641 --> 00:02:17,090
we're on TV.
I trimmed the cheek areas cause it creep

55
00:02:17,091 --> 00:02:17,924
up.
Gq.

56
00:02:18,650 --> 00:02:19,820
Gq Did.
Yeah.

57
00:02:19,821 --> 00:02:24,800
I'm trying to look fresh.
Well I have to admit the fact that after

58
00:02:24,801 --> 00:02:27,160
30 years of not having a beard meeting
you right,

59
00:02:27,161 --> 00:02:29,690
I ended up with that beard and then
started speaking Arabic.

60
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:32,180
Right out of nowhere.
Out of nowhere.

61
00:02:32,210 --> 00:02:35,150
How weird.
It was more academic to go when you're

62
00:02:35,151 --> 00:02:39,070
lecturing on the lecture circuit
sometimes for,

63
00:02:39,290 --> 00:02:39,870
but for

64
00:02:39,870 --> 00:02:43,710
guy with your experience,
like that kind of beard is a,

65
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:44,860
it's normal.
Yeah.

66
00:02:45,190 --> 00:02:48,510
Yeah.
I mean guys who have lived your line of

67
00:02:48,511 --> 00:02:49,344
work,

68
00:02:50,090 --> 00:02:51,830
I don't know man.
It's like counter culture,

69
00:02:51,831 --> 00:02:56,210
so anti establishment establishment.
So that's part of it.

70
00:02:56,211 --> 00:02:58,550
You know.
And like anything else you get into,

71
00:02:59,110 --> 00:03:00,850
I don't know.
It felt normal.

72
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:02,230
Right.
So it was like a,

73
00:03:02,231 --> 00:03:05,440
probably a crutch a little bit and uh,
something that felt right for a long

74
00:03:05,441 --> 00:03:07,060
time.
I don't think it's a crutch,

75
00:03:07,110 --> 00:03:09,440
but I think it's definitely like a mark
of the,

76
00:03:10,290 --> 00:03:14,700
the occupation.
I remember a red tick mark Kinko's book.

77
00:03:15,990 --> 00:03:19,080
Shanko Marchenko I read one of his books
way,

78
00:03:19,081 --> 00:03:20,750
way back in the day.
Rogue Warrior.

79
00:03:20,780 --> 00:03:23,790
Yeah.
And they were talking about guys who had

80
00:03:23,791 --> 00:03:27,000
dress,
they just how they didn't fit in with

81
00:03:27,001 --> 00:03:27,834
like regular military.

82
00:03:28,130 --> 00:03:28,851
Yeah,
no,

83
00:03:28,851 --> 00:03:30,410
totally,
totally like,

84
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:32,000
uh,
unconventional.

85
00:03:32,001 --> 00:03:33,680
Probably a better way to say it.
You know what I mean?

86
00:03:33,681 --> 00:03:37,550
So not in with authority,
not in with,

87
00:03:37,580 --> 00:03:38,780
you know,
uh,

88
00:03:39,140 --> 00:03:42,050
everybody being the same way,
not down with uniforms,

89
00:03:42,051 --> 00:03:42,950
not down with,
you know,

90
00:03:42,951 --> 00:03:44,330
using name and rank,
you know,

91
00:03:44,331 --> 00:03:47,060
we called everybody by their first name,
grew our hair long,

92
00:03:47,061 --> 00:03:48,440
grew beards wrong.
It was just kind of,

93
00:03:48,441 --> 00:03:49,760
uh,
uh,

94
00:03:49,910 --> 00:03:51,140
you had to earn that.
Right.

95
00:03:51,141 --> 00:03:53,090
You know what I mean?
So that's part of it.

96
00:03:53,091 --> 00:03:53,631
Like,
Hey,

97
00:03:53,631 --> 00:03:56,630
I earned the right to be able to be
autonomous,

98
00:03:56,631 --> 00:03:57,680
so,
so to speak.

99
00:03:57,681 --> 00:03:59,060
And so that's kind of the,
uh,

100
00:03:59,090 --> 00:03:59,923
some of it.

101
00:04:00,230 --> 00:04:03,470
It is interesting.
You know that that's the,

102
00:04:03,471 --> 00:04:04,304
the,
the,

103
00:04:04,370 --> 00:04:06,320
I mean,
I don't want to make distinctions,

104
00:04:06,321 --> 00:04:10,100
but the baddest motherfuckers in the
military are the ones who dress like,

105
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:15,020
like just regular savages.
It's something,

106
00:04:15,230 --> 00:04:16,720
there's something odd about that.
Right?

107
00:04:17,590 --> 00:04:19,420
I Dunno man.
There's just a,

108
00:04:19,610 --> 00:04:21,280
like that idea though,
that you have to earn it.

109
00:04:21,370 --> 00:04:22,450
Yeah.
Yeah.

110
00:04:22,451 --> 00:04:24,850
You got to earn it.
And you know,

111
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:29,260
it's like you get so tired of doing what
you're told and you want to do what you

112
00:04:29,261 --> 00:04:31,840
think you need to do for the job.
You know what I mean?

113
00:04:31,841 --> 00:04:33,160
So like what,
what is it,

114
00:04:33,161 --> 00:04:35,380
how,
how do I see that I need to accomplish

115
00:04:35,381 --> 00:04:36,670
this task,
whatever it is.

116
00:04:36,671 --> 00:04:39,820
And I don't need to be dictated from
somebody who's not going to be there

117
00:04:40,150 --> 00:04:42,940
telling me how to do it.
And so that goes all the way down to

118
00:04:42,941 --> 00:04:43,780
even like,
okay,

119
00:04:43,781 --> 00:04:45,160
well what kind of boots am I going to
wear?

120
00:04:45,161 --> 00:04:48,280
What Kinda,
what Kinda uniform do I need to

121
00:04:48,281 --> 00:04:50,120
accomplish this mission or do these
things?

122
00:04:50,121 --> 00:04:52,330
And I just kind of,
that's the way those guys are.

123
00:04:52,331 --> 00:04:53,980
They're always thinking about,
you know,

124
00:04:53,981 --> 00:04:55,330
not,
not how to,

125
00:04:55,390 --> 00:04:57,370
not how to,
not how to fall in line man,

126
00:04:57,371 --> 00:05:01,870
but like how can we think differently to
solve problems and,

127
00:05:01,871 --> 00:05:02,590
uh,
you know,

128
00:05:02,590 --> 00:05:04,030
the uniform is just one of those things.

129
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:06,690
This is very interesting now,
um,

130
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:09,120
for just,
so this is a standalone podcast so

131
00:05:09,121 --> 00:05:11,820
people don't have to go back and listen
to the first one that we did.

132
00:05:11,970 --> 00:05:15,180
We have Dr. Mark Gordon here,
a good friend of mine and,

133
00:05:15,260 --> 00:05:18,450
um,
Andrew Marr who is the founder of the

134
00:05:18,451 --> 00:05:19,160
warrior angel.

135
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:20,400
Yeah.
Me and my cofounder.

136
00:05:20,460 --> 00:05:22,880
Me and my brother Adam Mar,
who was also in the army

137
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:26,640
and we did a podcast a while back,
but for the people that didn't hear,

138
00:05:26,670 --> 00:05:30,660
explain what the Warrior Angels
Foundation is and what you guys do.

139
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:33,220
Yeah.
Can I get some context first,

140
00:05:33,221 --> 00:05:36,040
Joe?
So we talked about I was special forces

141
00:05:36,041 --> 00:05:39,430
green baret for a better part of a
decade,

142
00:05:39,431 --> 00:05:42,430
you know,
so I would say somebody defined by my

143
00:05:42,431 --> 00:05:44,440
vision of the future.
Uh,

144
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:47,890
and so that always led me to doing what
I wanted to do in life.

145
00:05:47,980 --> 00:05:49,030
And so,
you know,

146
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:51,100
special forces,
Spec ops type dudes,

147
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:54,850
they're in life and death situations
pretty regularly and,

148
00:05:54,910 --> 00:05:55,930
uh,
perform,

149
00:05:56,020 --> 00:05:57,350
uh,
otherwise they don't live.

150
00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:00,110
You know what I mean?
And so that was kind of life for the

151
00:06:00,111 --> 00:06:05,111
better part of 10 years being in life
and death situations on a regular basis.

152
00:06:05,751 --> 00:06:07,730
And so going from that,
you know,

153
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:09,860
uh,
I would say a high performer,

154
00:06:09,890 --> 00:06:10,820
uh,
by,

155
00:06:10,950 --> 00:06:14,600
you know,
by every metric to one day after my last

156
00:06:14,601 --> 00:06:15,950
deployment,
uh,

157
00:06:15,980 --> 00:06:19,850
I woke up and I was on 13 different
medications.

158
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:22,190
You know,
I couldn't remember how to drive home

159
00:06:22,191 --> 00:06:24,820
from the same route that I've been
driving home every day.

160
00:06:25,190 --> 00:06:28,280
Uh,
I was just in chronic pain all the time.

161
00:06:28,281 --> 00:06:31,490
I had these balance issues where I
couldn't walk in a straight line,

162
00:06:31,820 --> 00:06:34,130
uh,
blurry vision would go into double

163
00:06:34,131 --> 00:06:36,640
vision and I had these horrible migraine
headaches.

164
00:06:36,641 --> 00:06:39,980
So just the ability to bring that way
and then,

165
00:06:39,981 --> 00:06:42,290
uh,
started to have become depressed.

166
00:06:42,350 --> 00:06:43,910
And this was like,
uh,

167
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:46,790
this was just mind boggling to me
because I was living,

168
00:06:46,791 --> 00:06:48,380
I thought my life's purpose,
right?

169
00:06:48,740 --> 00:06:52,440
Doing the job I wanted to do with the
people I wanted to be with Mary,

170
00:06:52,450 --> 00:06:55,820
to the woman of my dreams,
had the family that we always wanted.

171
00:06:56,210 --> 00:06:58,880
But yet here I am,
I have all these physical problems.

172
00:06:58,881 --> 00:07:01,850
Now I'm starting to be depressed and I
don't have a reason to be depressed.

173
00:07:02,300 --> 00:07:05,840
And then I started having panic attacks
in public,

174
00:07:06,020 --> 00:07:08,930
in our weight room at home,
in front of my kids,

175
00:07:08,931 --> 00:07:11,900
you know,
like just breaking down crying and not

176
00:07:11,990 --> 00:07:15,260
knowing why and not being able to do
anything about it.

177
00:07:15,740 --> 00:07:16,610
And,
uh,

178
00:07:16,670 --> 00:07:18,380
and then I started to have,
you know,

179
00:07:18,381 --> 00:07:20,150
and that was again,
like my,

180
00:07:20,930 --> 00:07:23,720
the structure of reality.
It was fracturing around me.

181
00:07:23,750 --> 00:07:24,320
And,
uh,

182
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:25,130
I,
I,

183
00:07:25,130 --> 00:07:27,020
I didn't know why or what was going on,
you know,

184
00:07:27,021 --> 00:07:30,200
and the first thing he can think to do
and something like that was to drink.

185
00:07:30,201 --> 00:07:32,660
I was like,
I gotta I gotta stop this and I don't,

186
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:34,270
I don't know what to do.
Uh,

187
00:07:34,310 --> 00:07:36,500
I think I have some screws loose or
what's going on,

188
00:07:36,501 --> 00:07:40,880
but all I know is this is so disastrous.
Maybe if I just drank,

189
00:07:40,881 --> 00:07:41,930
I can,
I can put the,

190
00:07:42,020 --> 00:07:45,200
put the brakes on this a little bit and
uh,

191
00:07:45,250 --> 00:07:47,120
and,
and things just continued to get worse

192
00:07:47,121 --> 00:07:50,690
and then my behavior just continue to
skyrocket out of control.

193
00:07:51,410 --> 00:07:55,520
And it wasn't like I was making
conscious decisions to be fucked up.

194
00:07:55,550 --> 00:07:56,960
Uh,
like I'm driving,

195
00:07:56,990 --> 00:08:01,990
I'm drinking and driving on a regular
basis and I never even crossed my mind.

196
00:08:02,390 --> 00:08:03,710
Like,
that was a wrong thing to do.

197
00:08:03,740 --> 00:08:05,210
It was just like,
hey man,

198
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:08,870
I can't function unless I drink and I
got to drive.

199
00:08:08,871 --> 00:08:10,520
So that's what we're going to do,
you know?

200
00:08:10,521 --> 00:08:11,860
And then,
uh,

201
00:08:11,930 --> 00:08:16,850
start producing just horrible effects on
my family with that line of behavior.

202
00:08:17,210 --> 00:08:20,420
And it got to the point and,
and as a special forces operator,

203
00:08:20,421 --> 00:08:21,860
man,
all you want to do is operate.

204
00:08:21,861 --> 00:08:26,030
All you want to do is be on the team and
go and do the things that we signed up

205
00:08:26,031 --> 00:08:28,670
to do.
It didn't have any problem with that or

206
00:08:28,671 --> 00:08:29,690
it wasn't like,
Oh,

207
00:08:29,691 --> 00:08:32,300
you know,
all these combat scenarios are weighing

208
00:08:32,301 --> 00:08:34,880
on me and it's been too much and,
and I just can't handle it.

209
00:08:35,030 --> 00:08:36,770
Like,
that's the only thing I felt comfortable

210
00:08:36,771 --> 00:08:39,590
doing and wanted to get back to it.
And,

211
00:08:39,591 --> 00:08:40,640
uh,
but again,

212
00:08:40,641 --> 00:08:43,010
like I'd never had any of these symptoms
before.

213
00:08:43,010 --> 00:08:48,010
So life is just spiraling out of control
and not sleeping and everything else.

214
00:08:48,771 --> 00:08:50,060
And so finally,
you know,

215
00:08:50,061 --> 00:08:52,280
you sit on it until you can't sit on any
longer.

216
00:08:52,310 --> 00:08:53,690
And it got to the point where I was
like,

217
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:57,570
I'm not only am I a detriment to myself
and probably society,

218
00:08:57,630 --> 00:09:00,150
like I can't go out and operate right
now,

219
00:09:00,210 --> 00:09:04,200
like these guys can depend on me.
And so at that point I was like,

220
00:09:04,201 --> 00:09:06,630
I gotta raise my hand and I got to get
some help.

221
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:07,750
And,
um,

222
00:09:07,830 --> 00:09:10,560
you know,
that well intended people,

223
00:09:10,810 --> 00:09:14,740
eh,
wanted to offer as much help and find

224
00:09:14,741 --> 00:09:17,040
the answers as they possibly could.
But again,

225
00:09:17,041 --> 00:09:20,610
all that got me was 13 different
medications and,

226
00:09:20,611 --> 00:09:21,391
uh,
it was told,

227
00:09:21,391 --> 00:09:23,250
hey,
you've had so many head injuries,

228
00:09:23,251 --> 00:09:25,320
you can't afford to take another blow to
the head.

229
00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:28,740
And this is probably going to be the new
you.

230
00:09:28,770 --> 00:09:33,120
You're going to be on these medications,
take a pen and a pad everywhere you go.

231
00:09:33,390 --> 00:09:34,680
And,
um,

232
00:09:34,770 --> 00:09:38,250
and learn how to live within these new
parameters and schedule out your meds

233
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:40,110
and this is,
this is going to be that.

234
00:09:40,230 --> 00:09:43,440
And so it was a medical retirement.
It got so bad,

235
00:09:43,441 --> 00:09:45,750
Joe,
that my wife was nine months pregnant

236
00:09:45,751 --> 00:09:48,690
with our fifth child and she had to ask
me,

237
00:09:48,691 --> 00:09:50,940
Hey Andrew,
can you keep your drinking down today in

238
00:09:50,941 --> 00:09:54,330
case I go into labor so I don't have to
drive myself to the hospital,

239
00:09:54,380 --> 00:09:56,160
you know,
so that's all bad it was getting.

240
00:09:56,430 --> 00:09:59,520
And that wasn't enough to stop me.
And so she actually,

241
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,350
our son had a,
uh,

242
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:02,490
uh,
genetic,

243
00:10:02,580 --> 00:10:04,110
uh,
lymphatic malformation,

244
00:10:04,140 --> 00:10:05,460
his neck,
and he got sick.

245
00:10:05,461 --> 00:10:09,590
He's like 13 months old and it got
infected and it blew up to like the size

246
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:10,710
of a softball.

247
00:10:10,740 --> 00:10:12,180
And this is when she's nine months
pregnant.

248
00:10:12,540 --> 00:10:14,640
So we have to take him to the emergency
room.

249
00:10:14,670 --> 00:10:17,610
And my calf had been killing me for
about three days at this point.

250
00:10:18,060 --> 00:10:19,740
Uh,
I didn't think anything of it.

251
00:10:19,741 --> 00:10:21,990
I just wrote it off.
But we're in there in the emergency

252
00:10:21,991 --> 00:10:23,710
room,
like he's having trouble breathing.

253
00:10:23,860 --> 00:10:25,970
It's,
it's bad like a softball.

254
00:10:25,980 --> 00:10:27,420
And his neck.
Well,

255
00:10:27,780 --> 00:10:32,310
he turns out he has to go into emergency
surgery and then becky goes into labor.

256
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:34,470
Um,
so he's up on like the fifth floor

257
00:10:34,471 --> 00:10:37,470
getting emergency surgery.
Becky's given labor to our youngest son

258
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:41,130
on the second floor.
So I'm going back and forth between the

259
00:10:41,131 --> 00:10:44,520
fifth floor on the second floor.
And I'm like dragging my leg at this

260
00:10:44,521 --> 00:10:47,580
point cause it just stopped working.
Um,

261
00:10:47,610 --> 00:10:50,340
but you know,
I was all in and refuse any care till I

262
00:10:50,341 --> 00:10:51,750
get these two taken care of.

263
00:10:52,020 --> 00:10:53,970
Well,
we get Jason out of surgery.

264
00:10:54,030 --> 00:10:54,751
Uh,
you know,

265
00:10:54,751 --> 00:10:57,870
he's on the road to recovery,
get down for the birth.

266
00:10:57,910 --> 00:10:59,310
Uh,
we have our son Joe,

267
00:10:59,311 --> 00:11:00,660
Joe,
he's good to go.

268
00:11:00,870 --> 00:11:02,260
And then it turns out,
uh,

269
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:06,060
they finally rushed me to imaging and I
have a blood clot in my leg and it's

270
00:11:06,061 --> 00:11:09,060
broken off into both long.
So now I have a bilateral pulmonary

271
00:11:09,061 --> 00:11:11,070
embolisms and at this point they're
like,

272
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:13,230
hey man,
like we have a very small window here.

273
00:11:13,231 --> 00:11:15,660
This is very high mortality rate.
And A,

274
00:11:15,661 --> 00:11:17,570
I'm like laughing at them because like,
you know,

275
00:11:17,610 --> 00:11:18,840
I was drunk at the time.

276
00:11:21,510 --> 00:11:24,120
No bullshit.
And I'm like,

277
00:11:25,140 --> 00:11:26,970
you guys think this is going to kill me,
get in line.

278
00:11:27,030 --> 00:11:29,400
This isn't the vis a long line of
offenders here that,

279
00:11:29,430 --> 00:11:31,830
that I want a shot at that.
But um,

280
00:11:31,890 --> 00:11:34,380
so anyway,
so I'm sitting there in the hospital

281
00:11:34,381 --> 00:11:38,490
room and I'm just wondering and waiting
for somebody to come explain to me like

282
00:11:38,491 --> 00:11:41,460
how life has spiraled out of control
like this.

283
00:11:41,461 --> 00:11:42,840
And like somebody's going to say,
hey,

284
00:11:42,841 --> 00:11:44,880
this is a reason that you have these
blood clots.

285
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:47,250
You know,
here's what's going on with your head

286
00:11:47,251 --> 00:11:48,450
and all these things.
And it just,

287
00:11:48,451 --> 00:11:51,030
it never happens.
And I remember like,

288
00:11:51,031 --> 00:11:53,450
I got to go down and visit my son,
uh,

289
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:54,250
who was,
uh,

290
00:11:54,250 --> 00:11:59,250
in emergency recovery and I was there at
his hospital bed and,

291
00:11:59,261 --> 00:12:02,620
uh,
I had a bottle of whiskey or airplane

292
00:12:02,621 --> 00:12:06,010
bottle of whiskey and I popped the last
pain pill I ever took and I shot down

293
00:12:06,011 --> 00:12:06,430
the whiskey.

294
00:12:06,430 --> 00:12:08,080
That was just normal 24,
seven.

295
00:12:08,081 --> 00:12:11,320
How I operated at that time,
tried to just to cope and a,

296
00:12:11,321 --> 00:12:13,000
I had this epiphany,
you know,

297
00:12:13,420 --> 00:12:17,860
that hey,
if I continue on this same track and I

298
00:12:17,980 --> 00:12:21,700
continue to just wholesale buy,
everything in the medical system is,

299
00:12:21,970 --> 00:12:26,380
is telling me it's going to kill me and
it's going to ruin everything that I

300
00:12:26,381 --> 00:12:31,381
love so I can stay on that route or I
can decide to act and to change what I

301
00:12:31,781 --> 00:12:34,750
don't like.
And at that point it was everything.

302
00:12:34,780 --> 00:12:39,780
And so I made the promise to my son
right then and there that I was going to

303
00:12:39,821 --> 00:12:41,770
do some things.
One,

304
00:12:41,980 --> 00:12:45,970
I was going to get off all medication
and I was going to return to the man of

305
00:12:45,971 --> 00:12:50,971
my pre-injury status too.
I was going to find a way to heal

306
00:12:52,391 --> 00:12:54,310
myself.
And then three,

307
00:12:54,311 --> 00:12:57,820
I was going to turn around and do that
same thing for somebody else.

308
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:01,060
And so right then and there and the
hospital's bed,

309
00:13:01,061 --> 00:13:03,280
and I mean this is the honest to God,
true story.

310
00:13:03,281 --> 00:13:04,840
I said,
I don't care how,

311
00:13:05,230 --> 00:13:07,750
I don't know how,
but I've had enough.

312
00:13:07,900 --> 00:13:10,690
I've had enough of people telling me
that my life is over.

313
00:13:11,020 --> 00:13:12,490
And at that time,
you know,

314
00:13:12,491 --> 00:13:16,240
my identity was in special forces and
that was taken away because of the

315
00:13:16,241 --> 00:13:17,470
medical injuries.
And I said,

316
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:19,360
I don't care anymore.
I'm still a husband.

317
00:13:19,570 --> 00:13:22,180
I'm still a father and I'm going to get
better.

318
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:25,660
And that was enough to pull me out of
there,

319
00:13:25,690 --> 00:13:28,330
out of that negative spiral that I was
in.

320
00:13:28,780 --> 00:13:33,730
And to start being proactive again and
start being defined by a vision of the

321
00:13:33,731 --> 00:13:36,040
future.
And my vision of the future was just

322
00:13:36,041 --> 00:13:38,500
what I said.
And I didn't know it was going to lead

323
00:13:38,501 --> 00:13:41,410
to where we're at today,
but that was the catalyst.

324
00:13:41,620 --> 00:13:45,250
And so I started going and looking for
alternative therapies and it turned out

325
00:13:45,251 --> 00:13:48,130
like the government didn't want to pay
for anything that wasn't covered by

326
00:13:48,131 --> 00:13:48,970
their insurance.
Well,

327
00:13:48,971 --> 00:13:52,000
that's fine.
I'll charge it a max it on credit cards.

328
00:13:52,001 --> 00:13:53,380
That's fine.
I'll get more credit cards.

329
00:13:53,410 --> 00:13:55,900
I don't care.
I don't care if it's $1 million,

330
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:59,560
I will get the money and I will get
better and I will solve this problem.

331
00:14:00,190 --> 00:14:00,920
And,
uh,

332
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:03,070
then I started getting objective about
it and that was like,

333
00:14:03,071 --> 00:14:04,630
you know,
talking to everybody out there who's

334
00:14:04,631 --> 00:14:06,250
having head problems like,
hey,

335
00:14:06,470 --> 00:14:10,930
what's working for you guys?
And I got real interested in why did

336
00:14:10,931 --> 00:14:13,930
some things work for some people and
then not work for others,

337
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:14,940
you know,
you know,

338
00:14:15,250 --> 00:14:17,470
precursor and meeting mark.
But I'm starting to get really

339
00:14:17,471 --> 00:14:21,490
scientific minded or you know,
one objective data to be able to support

340
00:14:21,491 --> 00:14:21,850
things.

341
00:14:21,850 --> 00:14:25,540
And so there's all this,
these other treatment modalities out

342
00:14:25,541 --> 00:14:30,541
there and I did every single one of them
and some of them were little bit of a

343
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:33,730
benefit in the short term.
Some of them,

344
00:14:33,790 --> 00:14:36,700
you know,
reversed or made symptoms worse.

345
00:14:37,060 --> 00:14:40,210
Um,
but it was leading to that that we got

346
00:14:40,211 --> 00:14:41,950
some,
some publicity out of it.

347
00:14:42,220 --> 00:14:46,600
Mark read about it and just contacted me
and he didn't know anything else about

348
00:14:46,601 --> 00:14:48,580
me at that point,
but he said,

349
00:14:48,581 --> 00:14:49,480
hey,
you know,

350
00:14:49,870 --> 00:14:54,440
we've been treating Tbi for a number of
years now here's my credentials,

351
00:14:55,070 --> 00:14:59,690
here's the background story on it.
Here's some media that I had done and it

352
00:14:59,691 --> 00:15:02,270
was a podcast that you guys had done a
couple back with.

353
00:15:02,271 --> 00:15:02,841
Uh,
when,

354
00:15:02,841 --> 00:15:05,870
uh,
he had matt Gaza Neon and I'm listening

355
00:15:05,871 --> 00:15:10,250
to Matt tell a story.
And for the first time ever through

356
00:15:10,251 --> 00:15:11,690
hearing him,
I was like,

357
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:13,190
Holy Shit,
this is,

358
00:15:13,310 --> 00:15:14,900
this isn't specific to me.

359
00:15:14,990 --> 00:15:18,500
Like I got so wrapped up in myself like
I thought like the whole world's on

360
00:15:18,501 --> 00:15:21,350
pause and this is,
this is this my problem.

361
00:15:21,620 --> 00:15:23,120
And I realized,
Oh my God,

362
00:15:23,150 --> 00:15:28,150
this is a much bigger problem that has
wide reaching a repercussion is that

363
00:15:29,031 --> 00:15:32,810
doesn't just deal with me specifically.
And so as I'm hearing matt talk about

364
00:15:32,811 --> 00:15:35,930
all the problems that he's having,
it's like he's like tall telling my

365
00:15:35,931 --> 00:15:39,680
story to the teeth and then I hear mark
say,

366
00:15:40,370 --> 00:15:41,300
well,
not only that,

367
00:15:41,301 --> 00:15:43,430
but we can identify,
uh,

368
00:15:43,460 --> 00:15:46,880
an underlying condition for all of the
things that we were just talking about.

369
00:15:46,881 --> 00:15:48,920
And we can measure it objectively.
And like,

370
00:15:48,921 --> 00:15:50,600
that just blew my mind.
Cause I was like,

371
00:15:50,900 --> 00:15:54,440
here I am on 13 medications.
And there wasn't one objective

372
00:15:54,441 --> 00:15:57,410
measurement where somebody said,
let's put them on antidepressant

373
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:59,810
depressant.
Let's put him on another antidepressant.

374
00:15:59,811 --> 00:16:01,820
Let's put him on anti anxiety.
I was like,

375
00:16:01,821 --> 00:16:03,770
there was nothing objective about that.
I was like,

376
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:05,090
wait a minute.

377
00:16:05,090 --> 00:16:06,740
So they're not,
there was nothing you were saying there

378
00:16:06,741 --> 00:16:08,460
was nothing.
They were measuring subjective as

379
00:16:08,690 --> 00:16:11,000
there's a level of this that we need to
move up.

380
00:16:11,030 --> 00:16:12,860
There's a level of that we need to,
right.

381
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:15,100
Yeah.
Based off the symptoms and the

382
00:16:15,101 --> 00:16:17,530
complaints I had,
it was just throwing darts.

383
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:21,130
It's like I said,
13 medications from a person who never

384
00:16:21,131 --> 00:16:22,630
had any issue before

385
00:16:22,730 --> 00:16:26,250
and to all the guys that have served
that have gone through this kind of

386
00:16:26,251 --> 00:16:27,690
thing and not just guys that have
served,

387
00:16:27,691 --> 00:16:31,200
but also when you're dealing with Tbi.
We're talking about athletes,

388
00:16:31,201 --> 00:16:33,440
we're talking about former fighters.
Yeah.

389
00:16:33,570 --> 00:16:37,260
A lot of guys that have been in contact
with on a regular basis have these

390
00:16:37,261 --> 00:16:42,261
issues and what mark has done,
which has been just phenomenal,

391
00:16:42,510 --> 00:16:46,260
was open up a new door for treatment to
these people.

392
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:51,210
And I have talked to so many people and
I've been in contact with so many people

393
00:16:51,390 --> 00:16:55,170
that heard about you through the podcast
that we've done together and heard about

394
00:16:55,171 --> 00:16:59,710
your work and have gone on to completely
remove these medications.

395
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:01,420
Correct.
You know,

396
00:17:01,700 --> 00:17:06,700
that's a problem in psychiatry is there
are no real biological markers.

397
00:17:06,951 --> 00:17:11,000
They're trying to use a radiographic
studies like Spec Scans,

398
00:17:11,001 --> 00:17:12,500
Mris,
pet scans,

399
00:17:12,501 --> 00:17:16,220
and what have you as rationale for
starting people on medication.

400
00:17:16,430 --> 00:17:17,960
But there's absolutely,
you know,

401
00:17:17,961 --> 00:17:20,660
in the biomarker or the biomarker panel
that we have,

402
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:24,810
there's a direct correlation between
someone having had a head trauma re

403
00:17:24,980 --> 00:17:29,900
regardless of it was mild or a blast
trauma like Andrew had or a slip and

404
00:17:29,901 --> 00:17:32,690
fall or someone coming up and hitting
you behind the headboard,

405
00:17:32,900 --> 00:17:37,900
mma or boxers or Muay tight and there's
absolutely zero that they use to

406
00:17:38,750 --> 00:17:40,370
regulate what they're doing.
It says,

407
00:17:40,371 --> 00:17:42,140
okay,
today's Thursday,

408
00:17:42,141 --> 00:17:45,770
let's try this drug,
or this is Friday or else this month

409
00:17:45,771 --> 00:17:49,110
we're giving you this Satchel of meds.
As many of the vets have come up and

410
00:17:49,111 --> 00:17:51,300
told me,
depending upon the day of the week

411
00:17:51,340 --> 00:17:55,550
dictated what groupings of medications
they were given what,

412
00:17:55,560 --> 00:17:57,120
but let's break it down for people.

413
00:17:57,120 --> 00:18:00,300
What do you feel is the underlying cause
of all this?

414
00:18:00,301 --> 00:18:02,190
It's related to Tbi.
Okay,

415
00:18:02,940 --> 00:18:05,730
great question.
And the answer is number one from the

416
00:18:05,731 --> 00:18:08,790
head trauma,
it elicits chemical changes in the brain

417
00:18:08,791 --> 00:18:12,660
that we call inflammation.
And this inflammation leads to

418
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:15,750
disruption of chemical processes.
It's like,

419
00:18:15,980 --> 00:18:18,360
you know,
the old alkaline batteries or the car

420
00:18:18,361 --> 00:18:20,700
batteries where we used to put distilled
water into it.

421
00:18:20,701 --> 00:18:22,170
Well,
if you put coca cola in it,

422
00:18:22,290 --> 00:18:27,290
it totally changes the ability of
electrons to be conducted just like in

423
00:18:27,301 --> 00:18:30,360
the brain.
So the chemistry of the brain is altered

424
00:18:30,361 --> 00:18:34,080
by the inflammation and it starts
shutting down systems so that the nerves

425
00:18:34,170 --> 00:18:36,600
in left side of the brain can't talk to
the right side,

426
00:18:36,601 --> 00:18:39,990
or the frontal lobe of the brain can
talk to the temporal lobe of the brain.

427
00:18:40,230 --> 00:18:42,500
So you have disruption of,
um,

428
00:18:43,050 --> 00:18:46,050
executive function,
which is your ability to make correct

429
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:48,360
decisions about things right and wrong.

430
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:51,750
Why do we have over a million veterans
incarcerated?

431
00:18:52,110 --> 00:18:56,250
That's because they can't make the right
correct decisions about how to respond

432
00:18:56,251 --> 00:18:58,310
to an innocuous,
uh,

433
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:00,660
you know,
approach by an individual that they

434
00:19:00,661 --> 00:19:03,810
don't know and they respond by,
uh,

435
00:19:03,811 --> 00:19:08,811
assault or with physical or anger or a
yelling at people and that leads him

436
00:19:08,911 --> 00:19:12,420
into jail or into incarceration.
So anyway,

437
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:15,900
the inflammation leads to hormonal
deficiencies in the brain.

438
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:19,020
And what we've found is that there's,
since 1986,

439
00:19:19,021 --> 00:19:23,310
Dr Baylew out of Paris found that we
have enzyme systems that take

440
00:19:23,311 --> 00:19:28,311
cholesterol and convert it into hormones
that actuate and regulate our brain

441
00:19:29,221 --> 00:19:33,720
function from schizophrenia to als,
to Parkinson's disease,

442
00:19:33,721 --> 00:19:36,840
to bipolar,
to all the different disorders.

443
00:19:36,870 --> 00:19:40,500
There was a recent article that I sent
out to our journal Group and Andrew's in

444
00:19:40,501 --> 00:19:42,580
it,
and it was about management event,

445
00:19:42,581 --> 00:19:46,980
thigh of neuroinflammation,
brain inflammation to treat psychiatric

446
00:19:46,981 --> 00:19:47,814
diseases.

447
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,490
And in the past six months,
we've been starting to see a lot of

448
00:19:50,491 --> 00:19:53,400
articles talking specifically about
inflammation,

449
00:19:53,401 --> 00:19:57,300
creating all these things that we're
trying to treat with medications that

450
00:19:57,360 --> 00:19:59,040
are ineffective.
Uh,

451
00:19:59,060 --> 00:20:00,450
last month,
uh,

452
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:03,360
had a class in,
uh,

453
00:20:03,390 --> 00:20:08,390
Arizona and I presented a group of
articles and one of the key articles was

454
00:20:08,611 --> 00:20:11,970
the fact that they found people with
atypical depression.

455
00:20:11,971 --> 00:20:15,930
That's depression that doesn't respond
to traditional medication.

456
00:20:16,140 --> 00:20:20,070
So you're on whole bunch 13 medications
and you're still depressed.

457
00:20:20,700 --> 00:20:25,700
So they found in 61% of these people who
were still depressed with atypical

458
00:20:25,951 --> 00:20:28,200
depression,
that they had growth hormone deficiency.

459
00:20:28,710 --> 00:20:32,040
And then when they replaced the growth
hormone within one to two months,

460
00:20:32,070 --> 00:20:35,220
their depression disappeared.
And they had some beneficial side

461
00:20:35,221 --> 00:20:37,080
effects.
They slept better,

462
00:20:37,470 --> 00:20:41,670
they had more mental energy,
they were socially more adaptable,

463
00:20:41,820 --> 00:20:44,130
and they're reactive scores that
creates,

464
00:20:44,220 --> 00:20:45,900
you know,
an assault situation.

465
00:20:46,140 --> 00:20:48,100
They were calm,
someone said booted them and they said,

466
00:20:48,130 --> 00:20:48,963
Oh,
who do?

467
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:54,240
As opposed to getting into their face.
So it's a very clear,

468
00:20:54,580 --> 00:20:57,430
and it's becoming clearer and clearer in
the literature around the world.

469
00:20:57,490 --> 00:21:02,490
Now we've been doing this since 2004 and
the inflammation is really the problem.

470
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:08,440
So unfortunately there is no specific
medication.

471
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:13,560
They talk about use of aspirin and
Ibuprofen in things like Alzheimer's

472
00:21:13,661 --> 00:21:15,730
disease,
which is an inflammatory disease.

473
00:21:16,120 --> 00:21:21,120
I know I shared it with you in the past
that if a football player has one major

474
00:21:21,341 --> 00:21:25,510
concussion on the field,
he's 19 times at greater risk of

475
00:21:25,511 --> 00:21:29,560
developing Alzheimer's between 30 and 49
years of age because it's an

476
00:21:29,561 --> 00:21:32,860
inflammatory illness.
It's not,

477
00:21:32,950 --> 00:21:34,570
you know,
genetics by itself.

478
00:21:34,571 --> 00:21:37,060
There are people with genetic
predisposition to it because they

479
00:21:37,061 --> 00:21:39,940
generate this thing called Beta amyloid.
But trauma,

480
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:44,740
any kind of trauma to the head can
elicit increased production of Beta

481
00:21:44,741 --> 00:21:46,210
amyloid and lead to these problems.

482
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:50,290
So the,
the traumatic brain injury causes this

483
00:21:50,291 --> 00:21:51,700
inflammation.
And there's a,

484
00:21:51,701 --> 00:21:55,360
there's a process that goes on when the
brain is dealing with this inflammation.

485
00:21:55,540 --> 00:21:58,720
And that's what's disrupting all of
these normal functions.

486
00:21:58,721 --> 00:22:00,970
Executive functions.
Absolutely.

487
00:22:01,450 --> 00:22:04,210
And you know,
we have different,

488
00:22:04,300 --> 00:22:07,390
um,
relay centers in our brain that regulate

489
00:22:07,391 --> 00:22:10,500
whether or not you're going to be calm
or you going to be hyper,

490
00:22:10,580 --> 00:22:14,110
have anxiety.
One of the products that we use 100%

491
00:22:14,111 --> 00:22:16,570
natural,
about 80% of our treatment is all

492
00:22:16,571 --> 00:22:19,750
natural products with 10 to 20% being
pharmaceutical products,

493
00:22:19,751 --> 00:22:23,820
but no psychotropic or brain altering
medications slugging.

494
00:22:23,890 --> 00:22:25,250
What,
what kind of products do you use?

495
00:22:25,490 --> 00:22:26,800
Training alone,
pregnenolone.

496
00:22:26,801 --> 00:22:31,801
There's 6,160 articles talking about its
beneficial effect on anxiety.

497
00:22:32,620 --> 00:22:36,070
So we have people who come in on a
multitude of anxiety medications within

498
00:22:36,280 --> 00:22:38,250
three months.
They're off all their medication.

499
00:22:38,280 --> 00:22:41,410
They're alone.
Pregnenolone is called the mother of all

500
00:22:41,411 --> 00:22:41,950
hormones.

501
00:22:41,950 --> 00:22:44,380
It's the precursor.
It comes right off of cholesterol.

502
00:22:44,381 --> 00:22:45,590
The first comp,
uh,

503
00:22:45,700 --> 00:22:47,680
changed cholesterol becomes
pregnenolone,

504
00:22:47,950 --> 00:22:52,090
which goes down one pathway to become
testosterone and then down another

505
00:22:52,091 --> 00:22:55,540
pathway to become cortisol,
which is the anti inflammatory product.

506
00:22:56,050 --> 00:22:58,030
So we get benefits of,
you know,

507
00:22:58,300 --> 00:23:00,600
antiinflammatory effect by having
pregnenolone.

508
00:23:00,700 --> 00:23:05,590
But if you're on any kind of stat and
drug that decreases the availability of

509
00:23:05,780 --> 00:23:08,410
cholesterol in the brain or the body,
you lose.

510
00:23:08,430 --> 00:23:10,780
I have heard nothing but bad things
about staten drugs.

511
00:23:10,900 --> 00:23:13,450
Don't get me going.
I want to get you going because there's

512
00:23:13,451 --> 00:23:17,890
so many people that have this very
meager understanding of cholesterol and

513
00:23:17,891 --> 00:23:22,891
a understanding of like what is the
difference between having a,

514
00:23:23,531 --> 00:23:25,300
you know,
high cholesterol,

515
00:23:25,301 --> 00:23:26,590
low cholesterol,
what,

516
00:23:26,610 --> 00:23:27,420
you know,
what is,

517
00:23:27,420 --> 00:23:29,380
what's healthy,
what's not healthy?

518
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:33,970
What's your cholesterol mark?
My cholesterol is 350.

519
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,460
My ldl is,
and it should be according to the

520
00:23:36,461 --> 00:23:38,080
present standards,
less than 200.

521
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:43,080
My ldl cholesterol is two 73 my uh,
which is the ldl is the lousy kind and

522
00:23:45,470 --> 00:23:47,300
Hdl,
which is the happy to have the healthy

523
00:23:47,301 --> 00:23:50,840
one is like 23 to 40.
How did the numbers change over time?

524
00:23:51,320 --> 00:23:53,480
They're all saying no for the state,
for the standard.

525
00:23:53,530 --> 00:23:55,490
Oh,
of where they used to measure from the

526
00:23:55,490 --> 00:23:58,370
70s till now in my infancy in medicine,
uh,

527
00:23:58,460 --> 00:24:03,460
back in the late eighties,
it was 349 and then went to 329 then two

528
00:24:05,931 --> 00:24:09,710
79 then to 49 to 29 in less than 200
now.

529
00:24:10,100 --> 00:24:13,940
And we would expect our nutrition is
changing the quality of foods that we

530
00:24:13,941 --> 00:24:16,550
eat.
And the fact that we have since 1986

531
00:24:16,551 --> 00:24:19,040
staten drugs,
which are $36 billion a year,

532
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:24,230
we would anticipate that the rate of
cardiovascular disease should be diving,

533
00:24:24,620 --> 00:24:25,760
getting lower.
It's not,

534
00:24:25,790 --> 00:24:27,680
it's going up.
So what does it tell us?

535
00:24:27,681 --> 00:24:31,190
It tells us like a Smithkline Beecham us
study that was done.

536
00:24:31,490 --> 00:24:35,450
50% of all heart attacks happen in
people with normal or low levels of

537
00:24:35,451 --> 00:24:37,520
cholesterol.
So the question is then what's causing

538
00:24:37,521 --> 00:24:38,001
it?
Well,

539
00:24:38,001 --> 00:24:41,690
it turns out inflammation.
You start looking at inflammatory

540
00:24:41,691 --> 00:24:42,800
chemistry.
We,

541
00:24:42,830 --> 00:24:47,180
there's a group of um,
inflammatory markers that we have a

542
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:48,830
which sdl,
dl,

543
00:24:48,980 --> 00:24:51,110
homocysteine LP,
little a.

544
00:24:51,300 --> 00:24:54,800
So a whole group of them that can
predict better than cholesterol,

545
00:24:55,100 --> 00:24:57,710
your risk for heart disease.
And what we do in the offices,

546
00:24:57,770 --> 00:25:01,100
we have a biomarker panel for cardiac
inflammation.

547
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:03,860
Person comes in,
they've got a history of elevated

548
00:25:03,861 --> 00:25:06,380
cholesterol.
One of my closest buddies,

549
00:25:06,381 --> 00:25:07,540
Keith,
uh,

550
00:25:07,580 --> 00:25:11,690
x fighter pilot,
his clusteral one 41 50 my cholesterol

551
00:25:11,810 --> 00:25:16,810
303 50 we went and had an ultra fast ct
scan that looks at the heart and his

552
00:25:17,241 --> 00:25:22,241
calcium score was greater than 2000
which if it's a hundred or less as good

553
00:25:23,391 --> 00:25:27,290
grade than 400 horrible.
Mine was zero and I had cholesterol that

554
00:25:27,291 --> 00:25:28,370
was three times his.

555
00:25:28,820 --> 00:25:33,820
So after he had his open heart surgery
and his New v arteries put in,

556
00:25:34,170 --> 00:25:38,810
we went and had this panel called an lp
six my cholesterol sky high,

557
00:25:38,811 --> 00:25:42,050
but all these inflammatory markers,
low and keith situation,

558
00:25:42,051 --> 00:25:47,051
his inflammatory markers were sky high
even though his cholesterol was very

559
00:25:47,391 --> 00:25:48,290
low.
Yeah,

560
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:53,210
there's a simplistic understanding of
what what's causing these issues and

561
00:25:53,240 --> 00:25:56,720
people peg it on cholesterol and you
hear it so often,

562
00:25:56,721 --> 00:25:57,860
so many times,
and you're like,

563
00:25:58,490 --> 00:25:59,930
boy,
how do I even begin having this

564
00:25:59,931 --> 00:26:01,760
conversation with people?
I would like to,

565
00:26:01,780 --> 00:26:04,460
if anybody's listening and you want to
really get into this,

566
00:26:04,461 --> 00:26:08,240
a doctor Rhonda Patrick went pretty deep
on it in the last podcast that we did

567
00:26:08,241 --> 00:26:13,241
and the newly found connections between
refined sugars and refined carbohydrates

568
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:17,750
and saturated fats.
The combination of the two seems to be a

569
00:26:17,751 --> 00:26:21,710
gigantic issue where a saturated fats on
their own are not an issue.

570
00:26:22,070 --> 00:26:25,340
The small particle versus large particle
Ldl,

571
00:26:25,370 --> 00:26:27,560
small particles are the dangerous ones,
right?

572
00:26:27,590 --> 00:26:31,190
Stld is dangerous,
but it's at greater risk when you have

573
00:26:31,191 --> 00:26:35,780
an enzyme called a pla two in the blood,
which causes the stld.

574
00:26:35,781 --> 00:26:40,781
L does small density Ldl to fracture
into two parts that cause the immune

575
00:26:41,271 --> 00:26:44,310
system to be called in and once the
immune system

576
00:26:44,310 --> 00:26:47,160
gets there,
it creates all this inflammation and

577
00:26:47,161 --> 00:26:51,120
there's something that happens with ldl.
When you combine it with a refined

578
00:26:51,121 --> 00:26:54,630
sugars that's extremely bad for you.
It makes it worse.

579
00:26:54,660 --> 00:26:56,640
Yeah,
extremely bad sugars,

580
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,820
corn syrup,
things that people are drinking sodas

581
00:26:59,821 --> 00:27:04,440
and cake and bullshit,
all the refined bread and we products.

582
00:27:04,441 --> 00:27:06,540
All that stuff is fucking terrible for
you.

583
00:27:06,990 --> 00:27:09,150
Well,
it's just adding more inflammation on

584
00:27:09,151 --> 00:27:13,080
top of it.
And it's being conflated with saturated

585
00:27:13,081 --> 00:27:14,780
fats and with cholesterol.
And it's,

586
00:27:14,781 --> 00:27:16,470
it's not what the issue is.
Correct.

587
00:27:16,710 --> 00:27:19,530
So think about if you have a brain
injury and you're eating like that,

588
00:27:19,560 --> 00:27:23,040
you know what I mean?
Just like your [inaudible] on a fire and

589
00:27:23,041 --> 00:27:26,000
having no idea about it.
Like that's the issue that we face a lot

590
00:27:26,001 --> 00:27:27,540
of times.
So there's,

591
00:27:27,780 --> 00:27:31,500
there's the inflammation response and
then there's also the,

592
00:27:31,530 --> 00:27:36,450
the issues with the pituitary gland and
the hormonal deficiencies.

593
00:27:36,500 --> 00:27:37,110
Well,
it's,

594
00:27:37,110 --> 00:27:40,920
it's not only the two Terry Glen,
which generates the,

595
00:27:41,220 --> 00:27:43,430
uh,
signals to the thyroid gland,

596
00:27:43,710 --> 00:27:46,710
testicles at the ovaries to make their
hormones are the adrenal glands,

597
00:27:47,010 --> 00:27:49,050
but it's the fact that the,
um,

598
00:27:49,260 --> 00:27:52,920
we call them glial cells,
which are astrocytes and neuro cells,

599
00:27:53,130 --> 00:27:57,330
which generate their own hormones.
And it turns out that the hormones

600
00:27:57,331 --> 00:28:02,130
produced a below the neck have a genomic
effect on the body,

601
00:28:02,131 --> 00:28:05,190
which is slow.
It means it turns on genetic switches to

602
00:28:05,191 --> 00:28:08,250
do things.
But the hormones produced in the brain

603
00:28:08,251 --> 00:28:11,700
called the neuro steroids.
They have the immediate effect because

604
00:28:11,701 --> 00:28:15,840
they influence the membranes of neurons
to do things.

605
00:28:16,110 --> 00:28:20,820
So our ability to be rational because
you're taking different parts of the

606
00:28:20,821 --> 00:28:25,590
brain and they're all working in unison
as opposed to having this section that

607
00:28:25,620 --> 00:28:28,050
deals with,
you know how you respond to someone

608
00:28:28,051 --> 00:28:31,280
talking in a high voice to you or
pointing a gun at you or pointing at

609
00:28:31,281 --> 00:28:35,040
Pencil at you so you lose that
integration of the different parts of

610
00:28:35,041 --> 00:28:35,580
the brain.

611
00:28:35,580 --> 00:28:40,200
That's what each of the lobes is
responsible for is how we integrate

612
00:28:40,201 --> 00:28:44,970
signals coming in that the whole thing
is so fascinating because it seems like

613
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:50,000
there's so much to understand and for,
for the average person that goes to your

614
00:28:50,011 --> 00:28:52,680
general practitioner and the General
Practitioner says,

615
00:28:52,681 --> 00:28:53,760
Oh,
I've got high cholesterol.

616
00:28:53,761 --> 00:28:56,390
You need to be on a stat and drug,
and then you find out about all this.

617
00:28:56,400 --> 00:29:00,360
People get extremely angry.
I've talked to so many people that were

618
00:29:00,361 --> 00:29:03,990
on staten drugs and suffered all sorts
of health consequences because of that

619
00:29:04,170 --> 00:29:05,280
and then realize,
oh,

620
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:08,490
what about cutting all the fucking sugar
out of my diet?

621
00:29:08,520 --> 00:29:12,000
What about doing,
doing all this stuff that has been shown

622
00:29:12,001 --> 00:29:15,000
in all these more recent studies to have
a significant effect?

623
00:29:15,001 --> 00:29:18,300
Absolutely.
It's unfortunate that when science comes

624
00:29:18,301 --> 00:29:23,301
out and it's really good science that it
takes another 20 to 30 years before it

625
00:29:23,641 --> 00:29:26,700
gets into the medical community.
And there's no obligation for your

626
00:29:26,701 --> 00:29:28,650
general practitioner to be up on this
dot.

627
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:29,670
No,
absolutely not.

628
00:29:29,671 --> 00:29:32,550
Because it's status quo and it's
changing constantly.

629
00:29:32,580 --> 00:29:35,910
Yes,
and that's what has me and frustrated

630
00:29:35,911 --> 00:29:38,850
state all the time is because of the
science that's been sitting on the

631
00:29:38,851 --> 00:29:39,780
bench.
What I do,

632
00:29:39,781 --> 00:29:42,070
what I've been told I do is called

633
00:29:42,070 --> 00:29:45,220
translational medicine,
where I take the research that's on the

634
00:29:45,370 --> 00:29:49,450
bench that's already been done and I
look at it in large groups and then

635
00:29:49,480 --> 00:29:53,860
applied into the clinical practice.
And that's how we've had our success is

636
00:29:53,861 --> 00:29:55,900
we've got us,
we've taken the stuff that's sitting

637
00:29:55,901 --> 00:30:00,901
there ready to be used that's not being
used because we're in the paradigm of

638
00:30:02,020 --> 00:30:05,830
don't do anything for 30 years.
I mean every generation a little bit,

639
00:30:06,280 --> 00:30:09,040
something better happens,
but it takes 30 years.

640
00:30:09,510 --> 00:30:12,090
It's incredibly frustrating.
So Andrew,

641
00:30:12,300 --> 00:30:17,300
please go back to how you found out
about mark and what changes you made and

642
00:30:17,311 --> 00:30:18,000
what happened.

643
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:19,360
[inaudible] yeah.
Well,

644
00:30:19,361 --> 00:30:21,610
um,
cause I've only known you since you've

645
00:30:21,611 --> 00:30:25,390
been happy.
It's been a good ride,

646
00:30:28,150 --> 00:30:30,610
but you know,
if you lower cholesterol mark,

647
00:30:31,480 --> 00:30:34,630
it ruins all the hormonal production.
Correct.

648
00:30:34,660 --> 00:30:35,381
Right.
And,

649
00:30:35,381 --> 00:30:36,670
uh,
so that's not understood.

650
00:30:37,090 --> 00:30:38,220
But so,
uh,

651
00:30:38,221 --> 00:30:41,080
I mark found me,
I looked into everything.

652
00:30:41,090 --> 00:30:44,800
I was just saying one over,
listen to listen to that research,

653
00:30:45,070 --> 00:30:48,170
did my own research,
found out about the neuroendocrine

654
00:30:48,190 --> 00:30:51,610
system and ran it by my own people.
And so I went and saw an

655
00:30:51,611 --> 00:30:53,680
endocrinologist.
I was still in the army at this time.

656
00:30:53,681 --> 00:30:54,461
And I was saying,
Hey,

657
00:30:54,461 --> 00:30:58,480
do you think that any of these problems
were based off of the,

658
00:30:58,481 --> 00:31:00,820
you know,
hundreds or thousands of explosions that

659
00:31:00,821 --> 00:31:02,740
weave around on a,
on a routine basis?

660
00:31:02,741 --> 00:31:03,221
He's like,
no,

661
00:31:03,221 --> 00:31:04,300
I don't.
I don't think so.

662
00:31:04,810 --> 00:31:05,240
And,
uh,

663
00:31:05,240 --> 00:31:06,580
he was like a,
I was like,

664
00:31:06,581 --> 00:31:09,460
well,
can we test and replace any hormones

665
00:31:09,461 --> 00:31:10,000
that I'm missing?

666
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:11,830
Because,
I mean at that time we had done some

667
00:31:11,831 --> 00:31:14,530
tests and I knew that I was deficient in
things and he's like,

668
00:31:14,830 --> 00:31:16,690
ah,
I'm going to test you for anabolic

669
00:31:16,691 --> 00:31:19,960
steroids because I think the reason
you're having these problems is you're

670
00:31:19,961 --> 00:31:23,890
abusing anabolic steroids and if you
pass the test and you prove that you're

671
00:31:23,891 --> 00:31:27,580
not on anabolic steroids,
which will take about four to six weeks,

672
00:31:27,581 --> 00:31:30,460
then we'll talk about it.
Replacement Treatment Program.

673
00:31:30,520 --> 00:31:34,090
And I was fucking irate man.
Like I told him that he accused,

674
00:31:34,091 --> 00:31:37,960
you accuse me of being a,
going to him because his levels were so

675
00:31:37,961 --> 00:31:38,780
low.
Yeah.

676
00:31:38,780 --> 00:31:40,410
He's like,
he's like,

677
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:44,800
I've never seen levels this low unless
somebody was abusing anabolic steroids.

678
00:31:44,801 --> 00:31:48,000
And so you must be abusing antibiotics,
steroids and,

679
00:31:48,030 --> 00:31:51,820
and you're here essentially trying to
score drugs.

680
00:31:53,150 --> 00:31:54,660
Well,
if people don't understand what you're

681
00:31:54,661 --> 00:31:55,760
saying,
um,

682
00:31:56,310 --> 00:31:58,080
when you take antibiotics,
steroids,

683
00:31:58,081 --> 00:32:02,040
your natural testosterone shuts down.
A lot of times when people get off

684
00:32:02,041 --> 00:32:03,930
steroids,
then they'll go to a doctor,

685
00:32:03,931 --> 00:32:06,840
they're natural testosterone to shut
down and they'll go to a doctor to try

686
00:32:06,841 --> 00:32:10,100
to get hormone replacement therapy
because the only way a doctor is going

687
00:32:10,101 --> 00:32:12,900
to give you hormone replacement
therapies if your levels are low.

688
00:32:13,230 --> 00:32:16,560
And so one of the reasons for having low
levels is that you've,

689
00:32:16,620 --> 00:32:20,040
you've put all this exotic in his shit
in there and it's,

690
00:32:20,250 --> 00:32:20,911
you know,
your,

691
00:32:20,911 --> 00:32:22,410
your whole body's all confused.

692
00:32:23,160 --> 00:32:25,110
Yeah.
So thanks for clarifying that mark.

693
00:32:25,111 --> 00:32:27,690
Like I a what?
Who was it like,

694
00:32:27,691 --> 00:32:29,640
hey man,
you think I'm coming in here putting all

695
00:32:29,641 --> 00:32:31,740
this personal stuff on you because I
like,

696
00:32:31,741 --> 00:32:35,030
I like to make things up just cause you
want steroids cause I want steroid

697
00:32:35,070 --> 00:32:37,500
wants,
my life's a disaster and I think this is

698
00:32:37,501 --> 00:32:40,160
funny and I worry that he would you,
you know what I mean?

699
00:32:40,220 --> 00:32:41,630
It happened,
it happened twice.

700
00:32:41,631 --> 00:32:44,080
Joe,
twice back to back.

701
00:32:44,081 --> 00:32:47,720
You understand that there's other issues
that cause your body to have low

702
00:32:47,721 --> 00:32:49,340
testosterone.
That's what's crazy.

703
00:32:49,341 --> 00:32:51,800
So this is what puts to push us in this
direction,

704
00:32:51,801 --> 00:32:52,910
man.
So I was like,

705
00:32:52,911 --> 00:32:54,230
well,
I sat at that point,

706
00:32:54,231 --> 00:32:55,790
I started reading some of the literature
and I was like,

707
00:32:56,180 --> 00:32:57,350
it's not even black.
I mean,

708
00:32:57,351 --> 00:32:59,570
it's not even in the gray area.
This is black and white.

709
00:32:59,571 --> 00:33:04,130
There's like blast trauma can through
inflammation affect the hypothalamus and

710
00:33:04,131 --> 00:33:07,790
the pituitary gland and downregulate all
these hormones.

711
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:11,150
And so anyways,
so I finally,

712
00:33:11,151 --> 00:33:13,400
I link up with mark in southern
California.

713
00:33:13,460 --> 00:33:15,680
Um,
we run the labs,

714
00:33:15,681 --> 00:33:17,660
but we don't get the results back for
like two or three weeks.

715
00:33:17,661 --> 00:33:18,910
But he gives me a,
what we call it,

716
00:33:18,920 --> 00:33:22,790
provocative testosterone injection,
just to see how I react.

717
00:33:23,180 --> 00:33:25,070
And like up until this point,
man,

718
00:33:25,071 --> 00:33:28,490
like my life has just been a complete
disaster.

719
00:33:28,520 --> 00:33:30,830
I mean,
I've put a gun in my mouth several times

720
00:33:30,850 --> 00:33:35,060
and actually had thought about like,
if this is how life is going to continue

721
00:33:35,061 --> 00:33:39,440
and I continue to have this type of
negative effect on my family,

722
00:33:39,500 --> 00:33:40,790
I think I'll just end it,
man.

723
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:42,590
You know what I mean?
And,

724
00:33:42,591 --> 00:33:44,600
um,
and I got to the point where I was just

725
00:33:44,601 --> 00:33:47,300
like,
I can't do it for my family alone.

726
00:33:47,720 --> 00:33:49,970
And just kept driving.
So found mark,

727
00:33:49,971 --> 00:33:52,290
mark found me,
got the information and actually is

728
00:33:52,310 --> 00:33:54,710
there to see him in his office in
Encino.

729
00:33:55,130 --> 00:33:58,520
Get that injection.
I'm driving south on the four oh five

730
00:33:58,521 --> 00:34:01,310
I'm in bumper to bumper traffic like two
hours later.

731
00:34:01,311 --> 00:34:03,710
And usually man like me and traffic just
didn't mix.

732
00:34:04,130 --> 00:34:07,460
Um,
and to say that I had a hostile temper

733
00:34:07,461 --> 00:34:10,250
was like the understatement of the year.
And I realized like,

734
00:34:10,251 --> 00:34:11,840
Hey,
I'm all of a sudden I'm cool,

735
00:34:11,841 --> 00:34:15,020
I'm calm,
I'm collected and not having any issues.

736
00:34:15,021 --> 00:34:16,010
I'm like,
Whoa,

737
00:34:16,110 --> 00:34:19,850
I f I don't feel any anxiety.
Like for the last year and a half,

738
00:34:19,851 --> 00:34:22,640
I like it had this fist like coming out
of my stomach man,

739
00:34:22,670 --> 00:34:24,740
like at all times 24,
seven.

740
00:34:24,741 --> 00:34:27,020
It was horrible.
And it was gone.

741
00:34:27,140 --> 00:34:30,440
And I was like,
if this is any taste of what could be,

742
00:34:30,441 --> 00:34:34,010
this is incredible.
And I call my wife and we have a

743
00:34:34,011 --> 00:34:37,010
conversation for like an hour.
And that's the first time that we had

744
00:34:37,011 --> 00:34:39,500
talked more than two minutes in like a
year.

745
00:34:39,500 --> 00:34:41,970
And I didn't just say yes or no because
I just wasn't capable of,

746
00:34:41,971 --> 00:34:45,170
of anything else at that time.
And um,

747
00:34:45,171 --> 00:34:47,870
so fast forward for a few weeks from
there,

748
00:34:47,900 --> 00:34:49,640
you know,
he gets the report back and he's like,

749
00:34:49,641 --> 00:34:51,380
hey man,
you're deficient in everything.

750
00:34:51,680 --> 00:34:53,720
You know,
but we can,

751
00:34:53,780 --> 00:34:57,880
we can fix this.
And so we get on anti-inflammatory

752
00:34:57,890 --> 00:35:01,850
protocol and we replaced,
we replaced the and replenish the

753
00:35:01,851 --> 00:35:06,851
hormones that are deficient or
insufficient and life slowly and surely

754
00:35:07,251 --> 00:35:10,430
started to turn back on little by little
by little,

755
00:35:10,431 --> 00:35:14,270
by little to where I'm at today,
I'm off all medication.

756
00:35:14,500 --> 00:35:14,991
Uh,
you know,

757
00:35:14,991 --> 00:35:16,370
I'm clean,
I'm sober,

758
00:35:16,600 --> 00:35:18,410
uh,
performing as good,

759
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:23,560
if not better than my pre-injury status.
We startup organization called the

760
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:26,840
Warrior Angels Foundation to deliver
this same level of healing to other

761
00:35:26,841 --> 00:35:30,410
people who are in the exact same
predicament and situation.

762
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:32,540
And now I'm excited to say,
man,

763
00:35:32,570 --> 00:35:36,680
three years later we've delivered to
over 200 people with incredible results.

764
00:35:36,680 --> 00:35:39,930
So it meets with the scientific criteria
we can predict,

765
00:35:39,931 --> 00:35:43,560
we can measure and we can replicate.
And now it's not just my story,

766
00:35:43,561 --> 00:35:47,580
it's not just Mac os and he's Tori.
Mark's done this like 1400 times.

767
00:35:47,670 --> 00:35:52,230
We had done it 200 times through our
organization where somebody,

768
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:56,010
like we did a three year Tbi study
cohort,

769
00:35:56,011 --> 00:35:58,200
we took 58 of a,
of those 200 people,

770
00:35:58,290 --> 00:36:00,240
just the ones that are committed,
attempted suicide,

771
00:36:00,241 --> 00:36:03,300
58 individuals attempted suicide.
We had,

772
00:36:03,301 --> 00:36:07,190
we showed that within three months they,
um,

773
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:10,290
what was it?
91% had a 50% improvement.

774
00:36:10,291 --> 00:36:13,020
Correct.
So almost everybody had at least a 50%.

775
00:36:13,050 --> 00:36:16,290
This isn't their subjective analysis
improvement.

776
00:36:16,291 --> 00:36:19,600
After one year 90,
uh,

777
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:23,070
let's see,
73% of that population was off all

778
00:36:23,071 --> 00:36:24,750
medication.
This is unheard of.

779
00:36:24,870 --> 00:36:26,910
This is unheard of.
And this is people that wanted,

780
00:36:27,030 --> 00:36:29,160
that actually attempted to take their
own life,

781
00:36:29,340 --> 00:36:31,650
I think a minimum of two times in our
study.

782
00:36:31,830 --> 00:36:32,920
So we're,
we're,

783
00:36:32,980 --> 00:36:36,090
we're producing results that have never
been annotated before.

784
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:38,190
You know what I mean?
And it's through the scientific model

785
00:36:38,191 --> 00:36:40,830
that marks come up with this protocols.
It's unbelievable.

786
00:36:41,610 --> 00:36:42,960
That's on our website.
Uh,

787
00:36:42,961 --> 00:36:45,630
we got,
we got all that research on our website

788
00:36:45,750 --> 00:36:49,440
to check Waf,
tbi.org,

789
00:36:49,441 --> 00:36:52,470
but I got marks Predator as well.
I got mark's presentation.

790
00:36:52,471 --> 00:36:56,700
We got an incredible media page,
a library of all this information that

791
00:36:56,701 --> 00:37:00,050
didn't exist three years ago.
It's now all in one location and all the

792
00:37:00,051 --> 00:37:02,420
stuff that I'm saying here,
please don't take my word for word.

793
00:37:02,430 --> 00:37:04,990
You guys go out and fact check it.
And I can't tell you how many guys have

794
00:37:04,991 --> 00:37:09,630
come up to me after shows that have
either been in contact with you or have

795
00:37:09,631 --> 00:37:12,540
been in contact with other doctors
because of the information that you've

796
00:37:12,541 --> 00:37:14,640
given out.
And it was so thankful and so,

797
00:37:14,641 --> 00:37:17,640
and they're like,
you changing peoples future,

798
00:37:17,730 --> 00:37:21,360
you're literally giving them an option
that they didn't know existed.

799
00:37:21,450 --> 00:37:25,110
They thought they thought their world
was black and then you open the door and

800
00:37:25,140 --> 00:37:25,973
like,
oh,

801
00:37:26,130 --> 00:37:26,963
you can be okay.

802
00:37:27,090 --> 00:37:28,950
When Andrew first came to be,
uh,

803
00:37:29,010 --> 00:37:31,620
Andrew wasn't the first veteran that I
had seen.

804
00:37:31,740 --> 00:37:36,740
The first guy that I took care of was in
2009 he was active greenbrae and in

805
00:37:36,810 --> 00:37:41,520
North Carolina at Bragg and his wife,
I knew she was emergency room doc and

806
00:37:41,521 --> 00:37:45,300
she called me up and told me about her
husband getting ready to get a less than

807
00:37:45,301 --> 00:37:49,410
honorable discharge after four or five
tours of duty in Afghanistan.

808
00:37:49,470 --> 00:37:51,060
And uh,
she explained it to me.

809
00:37:51,061 --> 00:37:52,590
I said,
let me send you a kit.

810
00:37:52,680 --> 00:37:55,170
So I sent a kid out and we got the
results back.

811
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:57,660
I told her what to do,
she put them on to treatment.

812
00:37:57,661 --> 00:38:02,661
He lasted another two sign up towards or
two towards the duty and was doing

813
00:38:03,181 --> 00:38:07,650
phenomenally well.
But the key that drives me on this is

814
00:38:07,651 --> 00:38:12,651
guys getting back into life,
going to pepperdine business school.

815
00:38:12,661 --> 00:38:15,320
Now a guy who was,
um,

816
00:38:15,990 --> 00:38:20,160
attempted school five times and the
fifth time he was on our protocol for

817
00:38:20,161 --> 00:38:23,580
two or three months,
he ends up getting honors and now he

818
00:38:23,581 --> 00:38:28,290
wants to go back and give back to the va
for them not having treated him

819
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:33,030
optimally by going into sociology to try
and help them to understand what he had

820
00:38:33,031 --> 00:38:36,370
gone through with us.
We have guys who are in Wall Street now

821
00:38:36,380 --> 00:38:36,730
and

822
00:38:36,730 --> 00:38:39,070
all over,
I mean I'm a Harvard business school.

823
00:38:39,100 --> 00:38:41,720
I mean just all kinds of very
prestigious thing.

824
00:38:42,370 --> 00:38:47,170
They've got their family back there re
calling their parents going on for a

825
00:38:47,170 --> 00:38:48,640
couple of years.
We didn't give them a self help book.

826
00:38:48,641 --> 00:38:50,410
We didn't give him any snow,
Churchill teachings,

827
00:38:50,411 --> 00:38:53,170
anything else,
just fix what was deficient.

828
00:38:53,190 --> 00:38:54,640
Right.
And they were able to come back and make

829
00:38:54,641 --> 00:38:58,490
their own their own choices.
They get their life back on track is

830
00:38:58,600 --> 00:39:02,560
such a giant factor in this whole
equation that people need to understand.

831
00:39:02,561 --> 00:39:05,350
It's not just about motivational
speeches.

832
00:39:05,351 --> 00:39:08,860
It's not about memes that you put on
your instagram page to make you feel

833
00:39:08,861 --> 00:39:11,590
better about life.
It's literally about the chemical

834
00:39:11,591 --> 00:39:14,890
balance in your physical vehicle.
And if it's off,

835
00:39:14,980 --> 00:39:17,680
you're going to be off.
And if it's off because of diet,

836
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:20,500
if it's off because of injury,
whatever the factors are,

837
00:39:20,501 --> 00:39:22,990
you've got to figure out what those
factors are and you've got to correct

838
00:39:22,991 --> 00:39:24,850
them.
You got to correct them before

839
00:39:24,851 --> 00:39:27,010
self-help,
before all that bullshit,

840
00:39:27,220 --> 00:39:28,930
correct your diet,
correct.

841
00:39:29,530 --> 00:39:32,230
Whatever is deficient in your hormone
levels,

842
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:34,390
whatever is deficient in your nutrient
levels.

843
00:39:34,990 --> 00:39:35,840
It's so God damn it.

844
00:39:36,080 --> 00:39:37,910
Absolutely.
And I don't mean to,

845
00:39:37,940 --> 00:39:41,120
you know,
focus only on the neuro steroid and the

846
00:39:41,660 --> 00:39:43,130
inflammation,
as you just said,

847
00:39:43,850 --> 00:39:46,190
physical fitness and nutrition.
You know,

848
00:39:46,220 --> 00:39:50,180
my daughter Alison is a natural pathic
and she works with us with the warrior

849
00:39:50,181 --> 00:39:55,181
Angel Foundation to help with getting
the gut brain in sync so that you don't

850
00:39:56,181 --> 00:39:58,160
have the glutens,
you don't have all the junk we talked

851
00:39:58,161 --> 00:40:01,670
about because it,
they generate the poor nutrition,

852
00:40:01,671 --> 00:40:05,510
generates more inflammation that passes
through the gut into the blood,

853
00:40:05,511 --> 00:40:07,430
into the brain.
And they've actually,

854
00:40:07,431 --> 00:40:12,120
there was a study that came out of,
it was on the bbcs last week where they

855
00:40:12,121 --> 00:40:13,700
were talking about,
oh,

856
00:40:13,701 --> 00:40:17,260
we finally figured out that if you have
peripheral inflammation like diseases

857
00:40:17,261 --> 00:40:20,660
like Lupus or rheumatoid arthritis,
that the inflammation goes into the

858
00:40:20,661 --> 00:40:22,520
brain and can cause depression.
Well,

859
00:40:22,521 --> 00:40:24,320
it's been in the literature for 30
years.

860
00:40:24,321 --> 00:40:28,190
They finally are starting to understand
that things that happened on the

861
00:40:28,191 --> 00:40:30,290
periphery,
you can affect our brain's functioning.

862
00:40:30,291 --> 00:40:31,910
So nutrition very important

863
00:40:31,960 --> 00:40:35,400
is part of what's going on to just the
the human bodies.

864
00:40:35,401 --> 00:40:40,120
So insanely complex and there's so much
to understand and so much to be you have

865
00:40:40,121 --> 00:40:43,150
to kind of be like you are,
you have to be obsessed with all this

866
00:40:43,151 --> 00:40:45,040
stuff.
I didn't think I was obsessed.

867
00:40:45,070 --> 00:40:47,920
You're obsessed by pull out my phone up
to your face a little bit more,

868
00:40:48,340 --> 00:40:51,370
but you're you,
what you are doing though is just,

869
00:40:51,371 --> 00:40:54,210
it's,
it's so important and so it,

870
00:40:55,390 --> 00:40:58,030
there's just so little of it out there
for people.

871
00:40:58,120 --> 00:41:01,510
This is part of the problem.
It's like you have to really go looking

872
00:41:01,750 --> 00:41:03,310
for these solutions.
I mean,

873
00:41:03,311 --> 00:41:07,090
you got to go through every door in
every channel and try to find out.

874
00:41:07,360 --> 00:41:11,440
And so many times they want to offer you
some sort of a pill,

875
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:15,190
some sort of a pharmaceutical drug.
It's some sort of an antidepressant

876
00:41:15,310 --> 00:41:18,400
antianxiety medication.
And if that one doesn't take,

877
00:41:18,401 --> 00:41:22,060
they give you an antianxiety medication
on top of the anti anxiety medication,

878
00:41:22,810 --> 00:41:23,643
fuck,

879
00:41:24,360 --> 00:41:27,440
uh,
lunch or dinner with the admiral in,

880
00:41:27,460 --> 00:41:28,760
uh,
Virginia Beach,

881
00:41:28,850 --> 00:41:32,420
the beginning of this year.
And one of the stories that he was

882
00:41:32,421 --> 00:41:34,460
sharing was fact that his wife,

883
00:41:34,630 --> 00:41:37,160
uh,
was diagnosed at a va as having a

884
00:41:37,161 --> 00:41:40,520
thyroid related issues.
So they started treating it in the

885
00:41:40,521 --> 00:41:43,340
course of treating it,
she felt worse because they weren't

886
00:41:43,341 --> 00:41:46,040
giving her the ample amount of
replacement hormones.

887
00:41:46,490 --> 00:41:50,390
So the next thing that the doctor offers
her as an antidepressant,

888
00:41:50,780 --> 00:41:52,760
saying the reason why you still not
feeling well,

889
00:41:52,761 --> 00:41:55,610
it's because the antidepressant.
And when we got to her and checked out

890
00:41:55,611 --> 00:41:57,860
or hormone levels,
her hormone levels were off.

891
00:41:57,890 --> 00:41:59,420
And did they even check her hormone
levels?

892
00:41:59,421 --> 00:42:00,141
No,
of course not.

893
00:42:00,141 --> 00:42:02,510
You know,
they hand those Goddamn antidepressants

894
00:42:02,511 --> 00:42:03,480
out like fucking candy.

895
00:42:03,560 --> 00:42:05,270
That's what was crazy with me.
So I was like,

896
00:42:05,300 --> 00:42:07,070
there's gotta be an underlying
condition.

897
00:42:07,071 --> 00:42:08,600
Like in summary,
tell me what that is.

898
00:42:08,601 --> 00:42:10,640
I know we've got,
we're managing symptoms,

899
00:42:10,670 --> 00:42:13,430
but can we do that and can we do it
objectively or scientifically?

900
00:42:13,431 --> 00:42:15,320
And that's the beauty of,
of of the protocol.

901
00:42:15,321 --> 00:42:18,140
Because again,
to break it down for everybody out

902
00:42:18,141 --> 00:42:18,951
there,
Tbi,

903
00:42:18,951 --> 00:42:23,951
it's a two phase injury phase one is
that a physical trauma or assault?

904
00:42:24,290 --> 00:42:25,730
You know,
it could be black,

905
00:42:25,790 --> 00:42:26,660
uh,
uh,

906
00:42:26,661 --> 00:42:28,460
explosive blast way,
blunt force,

907
00:42:28,461 --> 00:42:30,710
trauma acceleration,
deacceleration slip,

908
00:42:30,711 --> 00:42:34,370
fall rollercoaster.
Anything that causes that anti

909
00:42:34,371 --> 00:42:37,610
inflammatory cascade to start
rollercoaster can cause it.

910
00:42:37,640 --> 00:42:39,290
The coordinator Mario Cannon,
the literature.

911
00:42:39,350 --> 00:42:40,520
Yeah,
but just think man,

912
00:42:40,521 --> 00:42:42,710
like,
so mark calls it the neuro permissive

913
00:42:42,711 --> 00:42:45,320
environment.
So if you don't have a good internal

914
00:42:45,321 --> 00:42:47,390
environment,
like you're eating a bunch of processed

915
00:42:47,391 --> 00:42:48,440
foods,
sugar,

916
00:42:48,650 --> 00:42:50,930
you're leaving just a,
a low quality of life,

917
00:42:50,931 --> 00:42:52,460
making poor lifestyle decisions.

918
00:42:52,670 --> 00:42:54,890
Those things,
how are like compounding interest over

919
00:42:54,891 --> 00:42:56,030
time,
uh,

920
00:42:56,031 --> 00:42:59,690
are being like low level blast waves.
And it could be something as simple as

921
00:42:59,691 --> 00:43:03,120
one of those 300 mile per hour moving
roller coaster.

922
00:43:03,121 --> 00:43:04,970
It's going to rock your head back and
forth.

923
00:43:05,190 --> 00:43:06,680
That could be enough to be,
you know,

924
00:43:06,710 --> 00:43:07,580
hey,
that's enough.

925
00:43:07,581 --> 00:43:11,030
That could cause the inflammation and
the inflammatory cascade and then that

926
00:43:11,031 --> 00:43:14,570
causes the hormones to become deficient
or insufficient.

927
00:43:14,930 --> 00:43:17,030
That's what we found through our
research,

928
00:43:17,031 --> 00:43:19,610
at least our,
that's what our research suggests is

929
00:43:19,611 --> 00:43:21,800
that's the process.
And if you don't get rid of the

930
00:43:21,801 --> 00:43:24,410
inflammation or bring the body back into
a balance,

931
00:43:24,590 --> 00:43:28,400
if you don't replenish or replace those
hormones that are lost,

932
00:43:28,640 --> 00:43:32,660
you're going to have all the physical
and psychological manifestations that we

933
00:43:32,661 --> 00:43:35,240
all know about and talked about.
And so that's the deal.

934
00:43:35,241 --> 00:43:36,560
Can we be objective?
Yes,

935
00:43:36,561 --> 00:43:38,330
we can.
Can we measure it?

936
00:43:38,331 --> 00:43:39,051
Yes,
we can.

937
00:43:39,051 --> 00:43:41,210
Can we predict and replicate?
Well,

938
00:43:41,211 --> 00:43:44,120
we've done it 1400 times so we can,
so now it's like,

939
00:43:44,300 --> 00:43:46,280
okay,
well how do we continue to take this to

940
00:43:46,281 --> 00:43:49,310
the next level to make sure this goes
mainstream?

941
00:43:49,860 --> 00:43:52,820
It's disseminating information on
platforms like this.

942
00:43:53,090 --> 00:43:54,800
We're working projects with the
government.

943
00:43:54,801 --> 00:43:57,140
Like right now.
We think we might be able to actually

944
00:43:57,290 --> 00:44:00,170
affect change on a real level here the
next few years.

945
00:44:00,310 --> 00:44:01,230
Yeah,
it's,

946
00:44:01,730 --> 00:44:03,090
it's so incredible

947
00:44:03,090 --> 00:44:06,330
that there is finally some sort of a
resource that there's something that

948
00:44:06,331 --> 00:44:08,090
people could turn to,
but uh,

949
00:44:08,280 --> 00:44:10,380
we need to lay it out.
Like there's,

950
00:44:10,640 --> 00:44:12,150
it's gotta be every point,
right?

951
00:44:12,151 --> 00:44:14,690
It's gotta be nutrition.
It's got to be exercise.

952
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:17,340
It's got to be reducing the
inflammation.

953
00:44:17,341 --> 00:44:20,400
It's gotta be replacing the hormones,
all those things together.

954
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:21,970
When,
when,

955
00:44:21,980 --> 00:44:24,660
uh,
an individual is suffering with

956
00:44:24,661 --> 00:44:26,890
symptoms,
I call it symptomatic Tbi.

957
00:44:26,891 --> 00:44:31,891
I don't really agree with the term pts
or ptsd or ptss especially

958
00:44:32,130 --> 00:44:34,350
when there's a history of trauma,
trauma,

959
00:44:34,500 --> 00:44:36,270
trauma to the body or trauma to the
brain.

960
00:44:36,330 --> 00:44:37,620
Yeah.
It's not necessarily,

961
00:44:37,650 --> 00:44:40,590
I think people think of it as like
stressful situations that guys have been

962
00:44:40,591 --> 00:44:42,840
through.
And one of the things that I've found in

963
00:44:42,841 --> 00:44:47,550
talking to a lot of guys who are
operators is they don't have like a high

964
00:44:47,551 --> 00:44:49,950
stress level because of what they've
seen.

965
00:44:50,160 --> 00:44:51,180
Like there,
the,

966
00:44:51,210 --> 00:44:54,060
there were the actors,
they were the ones who are doing the

967
00:44:54,061 --> 00:44:54,960
things.
There weren't,

968
00:44:55,120 --> 00:44:58,080
there's a lot of,
the stress level comes from a lot of the

969
00:44:58,081 --> 00:45:02,040
guys that we're not being proactive.
They're waiting around for something to

970
00:45:02,041 --> 00:45:04,980
happen to them.
And those are the guys that are the most

971
00:45:05,080 --> 00:45:08,640
effected by Stress Disorders.
The guys who were wondering when they

972
00:45:08,641 --> 00:45:11,820
were going to be attacked.
Whereas guys who are operators who are

973
00:45:11,821 --> 00:45:15,870
out there aggressive out there being
proactive actually correct doing it.

974
00:45:16,140 --> 00:45:19,950
They had less of a situation with that.
Less stress meditation for them going

975
00:45:19,951 --> 00:45:20,784
out and killing people.

976
00:45:21,750 --> 00:45:23,280
You're on the offensive,
right?

977
00:45:23,290 --> 00:45:25,650
Yeah.
So I mean I can speak from experience

978
00:45:25,651 --> 00:45:26,630
here.
You're,

979
00:45:26,640 --> 00:45:29,430
you're on the offensive.
You're not waiting to get on there.

980
00:45:29,431 --> 00:45:33,030
So when you're stuck in this,
what it is is a fight or flight

981
00:45:33,060 --> 00:45:34,680
mechanism,
you know what I mean?

982
00:45:34,681 --> 00:45:37,210
You're on security mode,
uh,

983
00:45:37,320 --> 00:45:40,680
in a non combat environment.
And so these guys get stuck in these

984
00:45:40,681 --> 00:45:42,840
fight or flight modes and they can't
figure out why,

985
00:45:42,841 --> 00:45:47,520
why am I in fight or flight like this?
This situation does not call for that

986
00:45:47,521 --> 00:45:50,730
type of response.
And then you look at it like if you're

987
00:45:50,731 --> 00:45:53,700
deficient in these things,
what's the body going to do if these got

988
00:45:53,701 --> 00:45:57,420
these mics,
electrical signals or they're sharing of

989
00:45:57,421 --> 00:45:59,940
neurons,
it's going to come out as a fight or

990
00:45:59,941 --> 00:46:03,150
flight mechanism and that's why they're
stuck in this and that's,

991
00:46:03,210 --> 00:46:07,530
it's called post traumatic stress.
But when we've treat these so called

992
00:46:07,531 --> 00:46:12,330
psychological issues as a physical
injury and replace and replenish,

993
00:46:12,420 --> 00:46:15,870
lower the inflammatory cascades,
guess what?

994
00:46:15,871 --> 00:46:18,570
Those symptoms resolve themselves
whether they were,

995
00:46:18,571 --> 00:46:20,850
whether they were on the defensive or
offensive.

996
00:46:20,880 --> 00:46:21,713
You know what I mean?

997
00:46:21,770 --> 00:46:24,530
That's fascinating.
But there's definitely a psychological

998
00:46:24,531 --> 00:46:28,370
difference between someone who becomes a
seal or a ranger or a green baret there.

999
00:46:28,650 --> 00:46:31,730
There's a documented yes,
there's a,

1000
00:46:31,850 --> 00:46:35,900
there's a difference in the mindset and
you know those,

1001
00:46:36,740 --> 00:46:39,830
those people are some of the most
important people we have in the planet.

1002
00:46:39,920 --> 00:46:41,530
Correct.
You have to have them.

1003
00:46:41,580 --> 00:46:44,120
You want to have a safe world.
You have to have the elite of the elite.

1004
00:46:44,150 --> 00:46:47,390
You have to like and people who don't
understand that you need to go to some

1005
00:46:47,391 --> 00:46:50,090
really terrible places in the world and
understand what's out there.

1006
00:46:50,780 --> 00:46:53,510
You know,
looking across the spectrum of special

1007
00:46:53,511 --> 00:46:57,680
ops and then the regular army.
We've talked about this in the past.

1008
00:46:57,710 --> 00:47:02,210
The pattern that I've been seeing also
in in civilian population is those

1009
00:47:02,211 --> 00:47:05,150
people who are more eight type get
better,

1010
00:47:05,151 --> 00:47:07,580
faster.
They want to get better as opposed to

1011
00:47:07,581 --> 00:47:09,450
the people who really don't want to get,

1012
00:47:09,760 --> 00:47:14,470
or you've seen it time and time again.
It's like if you have a clear vision of

1013
00:47:14,471 --> 00:47:15,940
the future and it's like,
Hey,

1014
00:47:15,941 --> 00:47:17,950
I'm going to get better.
Like I don't care what anybody else

1015
00:47:17,951 --> 00:47:20,560
says.
Like they were like the 10th stop that

1016
00:47:20,561 --> 00:47:22,150
they've come to their like,
we've tried everything,

1017
00:47:22,151 --> 00:47:24,430
we just found a,
you guys were going to do something,

1018
00:47:24,760 --> 00:47:27,390
let's get this going.
But those guys get better.

1019
00:47:27,400 --> 00:47:27,881
Not,
I mean,

1020
00:47:27,881 --> 00:47:28,900
not to mention,
of course,

1021
00:47:28,930 --> 00:47:30,100
objectively we can,
we can

1022
00:47:30,100 --> 00:47:32,710
push look at it,
but people come to us and you're like,

1023
00:47:32,740 --> 00:47:33,970
ah,
I don't know.

1024
00:47:33,971 --> 00:47:36,850
Life doesn't work out and everything
goes my way.

1025
00:47:36,880 --> 00:47:38,710
You know?
I hope this goes,

1026
00:47:38,711 --> 00:47:41,110
but I'm not getting my hopes up.
Anything else?

1027
00:47:41,410 --> 00:47:44,650
Those people will talk themselves out of
getting better and I wouldn't have

1028
00:47:44,651 --> 00:47:47,050
believed it unless I've seen it time and
time and time again,

1029
00:47:47,080 --> 00:47:49,150
hills people mentally fucked themselves
out of life.

1030
00:47:49,151 --> 00:47:51,670
Every step of the show we've watched him
put a gun in their mouth and pull the

1031
00:47:51,671 --> 00:47:53,380
trigger,
you know what I mean?

1032
00:47:53,381 --> 00:47:56,740
Unfortunately we've lost people to do in
that and it wasn't like,

1033
00:47:57,160 --> 00:47:57,851
hey,
we got,

1034
00:47:57,851 --> 00:48:00,340
we got you the help.
And then it was like,

1035
00:48:00,341 --> 00:48:05,341
well it's such a hassle to take the
medication at the prescribed times.

1036
00:48:06,071 --> 00:48:07,090
And I'm like,
what?

1037
00:48:07,600 --> 00:48:10,240
What?
And then I looked into that and like

1038
00:48:10,241 --> 00:48:11,980
that's a thing called noncompliance.

1039
00:48:11,980 --> 00:48:12,610
Like,
uh,

1040
00:48:12,610 --> 00:48:17,140
the Glaucoma Research Institute put out
a study like 60% of glaucoma patients

1041
00:48:17,141 --> 00:48:20,440
don't take their medication on time.
No one that that will cause them to go

1042
00:48:20,441 --> 00:48:22,360
blind.
Because I had needed to,

1043
00:48:22,361 --> 00:48:26,110
I needed to justify losing some people
that I couldn't,

1044
00:48:26,170 --> 00:48:29,110
I couldn't wrap my head around and like,
why won't they be compliant?

1045
00:48:30,010 --> 00:48:35,010
They people get in this Rut and they
memorize these emotions and they get in

1046
00:48:35,441 --> 00:48:37,630
this negative fucking place,
man.

1047
00:48:37,960 --> 00:48:40,510
And they,
they talk themselves right out of life.

1048
00:48:40,630 --> 00:48:45,630
And why people become super comfortable
with repeating these really negative

1049
00:48:45,970 --> 00:48:48,250
patterns.
They get comfortable because they know

1050
00:48:48,251 --> 00:48:50,860
those patterns.
It's very disturbing when you see

1051
00:48:50,861 --> 00:48:52,060
someone who's,
you know,

1052
00:48:52,061 --> 00:48:55,930
I grew up with a lot of guys that had
drug problems and when you would see

1053
00:48:55,960 --> 00:48:59,470
they would get hooked on coke or
something like that and get off of it

1054
00:48:59,471 --> 00:49:04,210
and know that they're on a better path,
but it's pulling them back in and not

1055
00:49:04,211 --> 00:49:06,560
even physically like the,
the,

1056
00:49:06,600 --> 00:49:11,260
the process of doing something that's
fucked up and ruining your life somehow

1057
00:49:11,261 --> 00:49:13,030
or another,
it becomes more comfortable than the

1058
00:49:13,031 --> 00:49:16,330
process of the unknown,
which is improving your life.

1059
00:49:16,740 --> 00:49:18,310
It's,
it's scary to people,

1060
00:49:18,311 --> 00:49:20,350
to people they know the of the devil.
They don't,

1061
00:49:20,351 --> 00:49:23,020
you know what I mean?
And I think at a neuroscience level,

1062
00:49:23,021 --> 00:49:24,910
right?
They could memorize an emotion cause

1063
00:49:24,911 --> 00:49:26,790
what I those thoughts and freaky.
Yeah,

1064
00:49:26,830 --> 00:49:30,580
yeah.
Whoa re structure of the brain through

1065
00:49:30,581 --> 00:49:33,580
neuroplasticity.
And that can be their new status quo.

1066
00:49:33,581 --> 00:49:36,100
Right.
How do you get people that are in that

1067
00:49:36,101 --> 00:49:38,110
mindset?
How do you get them free of that?

1068
00:49:38,140 --> 00:49:39,940
I mean,
how do you get someone who's this woe is

1069
00:49:39,941 --> 00:49:41,350
me.
It never works out,

1070
00:49:41,370 --> 00:49:42,700
you know?
Is there a way,

1071
00:49:42,730 --> 00:49:44,500
I mean,
is there a tried and true way,

1072
00:49:44,550 --> 00:49:45,790
man,
to direct my health,

1073
00:49:45,910 --> 00:49:47,740
trying to,
I wrecked my health tourism,

1074
00:49:47,860 --> 00:49:51,880
but we've had a couple of guys who had
stopped their protocol because they

1075
00:49:51,881 --> 00:49:56,110
didn't feel that anything was happening
from it and they send me an email after

1076
00:49:56,111 --> 00:49:57,730
they had been off for maybe a month.
I says,

1077
00:49:57,790 --> 00:49:59,440
Jeez,
I don't feel as well,

1078
00:49:59,470 --> 00:50:03,720
maybe it was working or they say that
we're working with the devil and and go

1079
00:50:03,770 --> 00:50:06,590
all kinds of weird.
Yeah.

1080
00:50:08,260 --> 00:50:11,880
I stopped January accepting a Pi cases,
you know,

1081
00:50:11,881 --> 00:50:14,860
legal cases because what's the impetus
for them to get better?

1082
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:16,670
Yeah,
zero.

1083
00:50:16,670 --> 00:50:19,030
They get what they want to pitch a
personal injury,

1084
00:50:19,031 --> 00:50:22,300
like the motor vehicle accident there.
One disability check.

1085
00:50:22,360 --> 00:50:23,860
Yeah.
Yeah,

1086
00:50:23,861 --> 00:50:27,870
so I stopped taking Pi cases.
That's unfortunate because there's gotta

1087
00:50:27,890 --> 00:50:28,220
be some

1088
00:50:28,220 --> 00:50:31,490
people that have real personal injuries
that would like to get better.

1089
00:50:32,600 --> 00:50:35,150
I talked to everybody,
I filter them,

1090
00:50:35,151 --> 00:50:37,070
but generally speaking,
I've cut down,

1091
00:50:37,370 --> 00:50:39,470
I just come to the conclusion,
you know,

1092
00:50:39,471 --> 00:50:40,161
like,
Hey,

1093
00:50:40,161 --> 00:50:42,410
I can't make the decision.
I can't make anybody get better.

1094
00:50:42,470 --> 00:50:43,370
Right.
You know what I mean?

1095
00:50:43,371 --> 00:50:45,890
Like all we can do is give out the
information,

1096
00:50:46,200 --> 00:50:49,850
but I mean shoes on and make them go to
like literally made myself sick,

1097
00:50:49,851 --> 00:50:51,950
like worried about people like,
oh my God,

1098
00:50:51,951 --> 00:50:53,030
you know,
we're going to lose something and I

1099
00:50:53,031 --> 00:50:53,864
can't like,
man,

1100
00:50:53,890 --> 00:50:56,240
I can't do anything.
All I can do is I can control my

1101
00:50:56,241 --> 00:51:00,680
attitude and my effort and I can push
out this information to the best of my

1102
00:51:00,681 --> 00:51:04,610
ability and people got to meet us
halfway.

1103
00:51:04,640 --> 00:51:07,100
You know what I mean?
Like there's nothing we can do to make

1104
00:51:07,101 --> 00:51:08,600
somebody want to get themselves better.

1105
00:51:08,810 --> 00:51:13,810
Talking with the guy tomorrow is his
brother's at wit's end and just wrecking

1106
00:51:13,850 --> 00:51:16,700
everything that he comes in and out of
every rehab program.

1107
00:51:16,990 --> 00:51:18,030
Uh,
just as a,

1108
00:51:18,060 --> 00:51:19,310
it's a horrible place.
It's,

1109
00:51:19,320 --> 00:51:21,020
it's,
I don't see an end in well,

1110
00:51:21,380 --> 00:51:23,420
and I'm going to talk to him tomorrow
because he wants to know how can I make

1111
00:51:23,421 --> 00:51:24,950
my brother want to get better?
And I'm like,

1112
00:51:25,010 --> 00:51:27,080
brother,
I love you man,

1113
00:51:27,081 --> 00:51:32,081
but we can't do,
I can't force somebody to do that and

1114
00:51:32,560 --> 00:51:33,770
that disaster,
I don't know.

1115
00:51:34,010 --> 00:51:37,850
The tragic part of that I think is,
um,

1116
00:51:37,940 --> 00:51:39,860
you know,
the person's not thinking right because

1117
00:51:39,890 --> 00:51:41,570
they're,
their judgments clouded because of a

1118
00:51:41,571 --> 00:51:42,440
head injury.
You know,

1119
00:51:42,441 --> 00:51:43,880
serving the country.
It's,

1120
00:51:43,940 --> 00:51:45,270
it's,
it's,

1121
00:51:45,330 --> 00:51:47,600
it's a bummer.
One of the battles that we have also is

1122
00:51:47,601 --> 00:51:50,180
that people,
relationships,

1123
00:51:50,181 --> 00:51:55,010
I speak to wipes that are a strange
husbands that are strange when we take

1124
00:51:55,011 --> 00:51:57,950
on a new veteran or patient,
uh,

1125
00:51:58,340 --> 00:52:02,210
to let them know that the person that
they've been dealing with post traumatic

1126
00:52:02,211 --> 00:52:05,000
brain injury is not really the person
they want to be.

1127
00:52:05,330 --> 00:52:08,180
That's an effect of the hormonal
dysfunctioning.

1128
00:52:08,390 --> 00:52:10,190
So they're depressed,
they're angry,

1129
00:52:10,250 --> 00:52:11,120
they're,
you know,

1130
00:52:11,510 --> 00:52:15,290
they're difficult to be around.
So I tried to get them to help in the

1131
00:52:15,291 --> 00:52:18,590
protocol to get them better in what
we've seen are couples getting back

1132
00:52:18,591 --> 00:52:20,570
together.
We have a 77 year old,

1133
00:52:20,710 --> 00:52:25,610
a Vietnam veteran who lost everything.
He's back with his kids now he's out and

1134
00:52:25,611 --> 00:52:28,040
back chopping wood and Boston.
You know,

1135
00:52:28,070 --> 00:52:31,250
just,
that's the reward that really is the

1136
00:52:31,251 --> 00:52:33,610
reward.
But people have to understand that if

1137
00:52:33,611 --> 00:52:37,400
that you've had traumatic brain injury,
anticipate within one year's time,

1138
00:52:37,460 --> 00:52:40,040
total change in the person,
total change.

1139
00:52:40,520 --> 00:52:42,930
They're now no longer the person that
you anticipate.

1140
00:52:42,931 --> 00:52:45,620
How long did it take you for that
transition?

1141
00:52:46,280 --> 00:52:46,940
Well,
it was,

1142
00:52:46,940 --> 00:52:50,120
uh,
I started first having symptoms like six

1143
00:52:50,121 --> 00:52:52,220
months after I got home.
You know what I mean?

1144
00:52:52,221 --> 00:52:53,420
So that's the difficult part.

1145
00:52:53,420 --> 00:52:56,150
Like you're not missing a limb,
so you don't think anything like,

1146
00:52:56,151 --> 00:52:58,940
we are rocking and rolling,
come back,

1147
00:52:58,970 --> 00:53:00,920
good to go,
happy to be alive.

1148
00:53:00,921 --> 00:53:03,080
Let's get ready for the next one.
And then boom,

1149
00:53:03,110 --> 00:53:05,600
stuff starts happening and it's like,
oh my gosh,

1150
00:53:05,630 --> 00:53:07,460
what's going on?
You know?

1151
00:53:07,490 --> 00:53:10,430
Um,
but you can't see anything and you just

1152
00:53:10,431 --> 00:53:15,431
keep going and you keep seeing this low
quality of life and then you want help

1153
00:53:15,980 --> 00:53:18,500
and you can't get help.
Uh,

1154
00:53:18,680 --> 00:53:21,680
you asked for help,
you're getting medication,

1155
00:53:21,860 --> 00:53:24,770
start drinking,
sleep gets messed up,

1156
00:53:24,840 --> 00:53:28,110
nutrition gets messed up,
start wrecking relationships,

1157
00:53:28,590 --> 00:53:31,890
then start thinking about,
I'll never be able to do what I thought

1158
00:53:31,891 --> 00:53:34,980
I was supposed to do.
Nobody understands me.

1159
00:53:35,520 --> 00:53:37,830
Um,
what's the future gonna be like,

1160
00:53:37,831 --> 00:53:38,880
like this,
you know,

1161
00:53:38,881 --> 00:53:40,890
and it doesn't get neat.
And that's how you get trapped into

1162
00:53:40,891 --> 00:53:43,380
these memorizing these negative states.

1163
00:53:43,410 --> 00:53:47,700
Cause you get stuck in that for you.
You heard mark on the podcast,

1164
00:53:47,880 --> 00:53:52,880
how long did it take you to act and how
long did it take after their tea for you

1165
00:53:53,071 --> 00:53:54,750
to become who you are now?
It's,

1166
00:53:54,751 --> 00:53:57,990
so I made that decision at my son's
bedside and that was,

1167
00:53:58,150 --> 00:54:01,050
uh,
several months before I met mark.

1168
00:54:01,260 --> 00:54:02,580
Well heres this,
how many years ago?

1169
00:54:02,610 --> 00:54:04,890
This is 2000,
uh,

1170
00:54:05,070 --> 00:54:07,860
14.
January 7th,

1171
00:54:07,861 --> 00:54:12,420
September of 2014 and I didn't meet him
until December,

1172
00:54:12,420 --> 00:54:13,111
2014.
Right?

1173
00:54:13,111 --> 00:54:14,370
So,
uh,

1174
00:54:14,371 --> 00:54:17,730
it was all of 2014.
It was just a disaster,

1175
00:54:17,760 --> 00:54:19,920
right.
Leading up to the hospital scene.

1176
00:54:20,190 --> 00:54:21,690
So I made the decision like,
Hey,

1177
00:54:21,691 --> 00:54:23,430
at that point it was like,
you know what?

1178
00:54:23,460 --> 00:54:26,910
I've always been defined by my future,
but all of a sudden like,

1179
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:30,060
you know,
like being a special forces greenbrae

1180
00:54:30,100 --> 00:54:32,460
was my mask.
We all wear our masks and that's how I,

1181
00:54:33,020 --> 00:54:34,680
uh,
that that was my identity,

1182
00:54:34,681 --> 00:54:35,790
or at least I thought it was.

1183
00:54:35,790 --> 00:54:37,890
And so when that got taken away from me,
it was like,

1184
00:54:37,891 --> 00:54:39,030
well,
what am I going to do now?

1185
00:54:39,420 --> 00:54:44,100
And now I'm sick and now my children are
sick and now they're telling me like I

1186
00:54:44,101 --> 00:54:46,920
have a brain injury.
Like what does that mean?

1187
00:54:46,950 --> 00:54:49,080
Like that this is like just getting
rocked.

1188
00:54:49,470 --> 00:54:54,240
So like being rocked by circumstances
knocked me for a year and a half,

1189
00:54:54,250 --> 00:54:56,040
just,
it knocked me and like I wasn't

1190
00:54:56,041 --> 00:54:57,600
prepared,
I wasn't ready.

1191
00:54:57,690 --> 00:55:01,380
I didn't know how to deal with it.
And it wasn't until I made that decision

1192
00:55:01,381 --> 00:55:02,640
that I was like,
no,

1193
00:55:02,730 --> 00:55:06,750
I've always been defined by going after
the future that I want to create.

1194
00:55:07,020 --> 00:55:09,120
I'm going back to that.
And it was like,

1195
00:55:09,150 --> 00:55:11,280
so there was like a will,
you know,

1196
00:55:11,281 --> 00:55:12,090
that was to it.
Like,

1197
00:55:12,090 --> 00:55:15,420
I don't know where it came from,
but like I could observe my thoughts and

1198
00:55:15,421 --> 00:55:17,010
I was like,
these thoughts that are being produced

1199
00:55:17,011 --> 00:55:19,200
now or not me,
I don't know where they're coming from,

1200
00:55:19,530 --> 00:55:22,360
but there is a will inside me that says
we're gonna fight this and we're going

1201
00:55:22,361 --> 00:55:23,910
to,
we're going to find a way to come out on

1202
00:55:23,911 --> 00:55:24,744
the other side.

1203
00:55:24,990 --> 00:55:27,870
So that happened in September,
you know,

1204
00:55:27,910 --> 00:55:30,450
uh,
fast forward to finding mark.

1205
00:55:30,780 --> 00:55:35,430
So it was like quick,
like after three months of the protocol,

1206
00:55:35,490 --> 00:55:38,520
like physiologically I felt like myself
again,

1207
00:55:38,850 --> 00:55:40,980
I was off all medication every three
miles.

1208
00:55:41,460 --> 00:55:43,290
How long did it take you to get off the
medication?

1209
00:55:43,320 --> 00:55:45,720
Did you Turkey,
[inaudible] Turkey,

1210
00:55:45,790 --> 00:55:47,100
they say,
you should never do that.

1211
00:55:47,290 --> 00:55:50,370
Never do that.
I would just have that in place in my

1212
00:55:50,371 --> 00:55:51,210
life.
Doctors,

1213
00:55:51,700 --> 00:55:52,533
no,
I,

1214
00:55:52,670 --> 00:55:54,510
how's that?
A place in my life that I was like,

1215
00:55:54,511 --> 00:55:55,320
Hey,
I am,

1216
00:55:55,320 --> 00:56:00,320
I accept whatever fallout could happen,
but whatever I'm going to feel it's not

1217
00:56:00,931 --> 00:56:04,200
going to be artificial.
I'm just going to feel whatever it is

1218
00:56:04,290 --> 00:56:06,660
and I'm a,
and I'm going to deal with it on,

1219
00:56:06,720 --> 00:56:09,720
on my terms.
And I'm not going to be zombied out.

1220
00:56:09,960 --> 00:56:12,000
It was rough.
It was rough.

1221
00:56:12,390 --> 00:56:13,470
Um,
so I,

1222
00:56:13,500 --> 00:56:16,290
I was off all medication before I got to
mark,

1223
00:56:16,291 --> 00:56:16,980
you know what I mean?

1224
00:56:16,980 --> 00:56:18,450
And so,
uh,

1225
00:56:18,690 --> 00:56:22,320
I didn't like,
I didn't have control of like my mind

1226
00:56:22,321 --> 00:56:24,220
the way I wanted to like the way I do
now.

1227
00:56:24,221 --> 00:56:26,710
So it was,
I had to work very hard and not just to

1228
00:56:26,711 --> 00:56:28,030
lose it on people.
For instance,

1229
00:56:28,031 --> 00:56:30,190
like we were,
um,

1230
00:56:30,670 --> 00:56:33,220
my was with my wife,
we were in a fast food restaurant

1231
00:56:33,221 --> 00:56:35,680
picking up some food for my youngest
daughter.

1232
00:56:36,640 --> 00:56:38,020
And so I'm going there,
grabbing some food.

1233
00:56:38,021 --> 00:56:40,490
I see this kid,
teenager in the parking lot and he,

1234
00:56:40,960 --> 00:56:42,430
I don't know,
this kid throws his cup down,

1235
00:56:42,431 --> 00:56:43,930
he's cussing,
he's causing the scene.

1236
00:56:44,410 --> 00:56:46,300
I felt like I needed to intervene.
I don't know why.

1237
00:56:46,301 --> 00:56:47,170
So I'm like,
Hey man,

1238
00:56:47,171 --> 00:56:49,060
pick your cup up,
throw in the trash,

1239
00:56:49,061 --> 00:56:51,730
quit yelling customers everywhere
families are here.

1240
00:56:52,030 --> 00:56:53,980
And he tells me to go fuck myself.
And I'm like,

1241
00:56:54,460 --> 00:56:56,140
dude,
go pick up your stuff and put in the

1242
00:56:56,141 --> 00:56:56,860
trash.

1243
00:56:56,860 --> 00:56:59,110
And he said the same thing.
And before I knew it,

1244
00:56:59,111 --> 00:57:01,360
I just backhanded this kid across the
face,

1245
00:57:01,570 --> 00:57:04,120
dropped them on the ground,
and then I picked him up and I threw him

1246
00:57:04,121 --> 00:57:06,040
into oncoming traffic.
Oh Jesus.

1247
00:57:06,070 --> 00:57:09,520
Yeah.
Well the parking lot took offense to

1248
00:57:09,521 --> 00:57:10,121
that.
Right?

1249
00:57:10,121 --> 00:57:11,920
It's right.
Rightly rightly so.

1250
00:57:11,950 --> 00:57:15,340
You know what I mean?
And so I got people swarming me.

1251
00:57:15,490 --> 00:57:17,740
Next thing I know,
like I dropped like three dudes in the

1252
00:57:17,741 --> 00:57:22,720
parking lot and I look up after dropping
the last guy and like my wife's

1253
00:57:22,721 --> 00:57:25,870
breastfeeding and three of my children
are looking at me and like they're in,

1254
00:57:26,090 --> 00:57:29,860
they're an like horror is on their face.
Just horror struck.

1255
00:57:29,920 --> 00:57:31,630
And I'm like,
my God man,

1256
00:57:31,631 --> 00:57:36,400
if I don't get control of myself,
like not only is this going to possibly

1257
00:57:36,401 --> 00:57:38,170
kill me,
I'm going to kill somebody else.

1258
00:57:38,200 --> 00:57:39,460
You know what I mean?
Like I had,

1259
00:57:40,090 --> 00:57:41,200
I felt like I,
I just,

1260
00:57:41,530 --> 00:57:43,030
I didn't know what happened.
Something happened.

1261
00:57:43,031 --> 00:57:44,800
Boom.
I came to and it was like,

1262
00:57:44,860 --> 00:57:46,870
Dear God,
I just dropped a parking lot and I'm

1263
00:57:46,871 --> 00:57:50,200
doing evasive maneuvers in my fucking
minivan trying to get out of it.

1264
00:57:53,890 --> 00:57:55,300
Oh my God,
I'm funny.

1265
00:57:55,301 --> 00:57:56,240
But not,
but not funny.

1266
00:57:56,770 --> 00:57:57,850
You know what I mean?
So,

1267
00:57:57,851 --> 00:57:58,540
you know,
it was,

1268
00:57:58,540 --> 00:58:00,610
it was this process of,
um,

1269
00:58:00,670 --> 00:58:02,950
so it was rough man.
It was rough coming off medication.

1270
00:58:02,951 --> 00:58:04,900
I don't recommend it from anybody for
anybody else,

1271
00:58:04,901 --> 00:58:05,950
but it was like,
hey man,

1272
00:58:05,951 --> 00:58:08,950
like I want off of that.
Cause that just made me a Zombie,

1273
00:58:09,070 --> 00:58:10,900
just like drooling on myself.
Zone B.

1274
00:58:10,930 --> 00:58:15,730
What steps did you take as far as your
diet and exercise and then mark's

1275
00:58:15,731 --> 00:58:17,230
protocol?
I eat,

1276
00:58:17,231 --> 00:58:17,891
uh,
you know,

1277
00:58:17,891 --> 00:58:21,070
basically try to anti inflammatory diet,
you know what I mean?

1278
00:58:21,130 --> 00:58:23,980
Um,
and that's just based off my individual

1279
00:58:23,981 --> 00:58:26,470
needs at that time.
Um,

1280
00:58:27,250 --> 00:58:30,430
I would just remaining active.
So what I mean by anti inflammatory

1281
00:58:30,431 --> 00:58:31,540
diet,
what did you do differently?

1282
00:58:32,080 --> 00:58:33,160
Uh,
well,

1283
00:58:33,161 --> 00:58:35,560
just learning what causes inflammation,
right?

1284
00:58:35,561 --> 00:58:37,750
So where are we talking about?
Like refined sugars,

1285
00:58:37,751 --> 00:58:40,420
refined carbohydrates,
getting away from things that were

1286
00:58:40,421 --> 00:58:42,190
packaged for me,
you know what I mean?

1287
00:58:42,190 --> 00:58:44,710
Going back to more wholesome,
whole foods.

1288
00:58:44,740 --> 00:58:47,880
And this is before mark's protocol or,
no,

1289
00:58:47,900 --> 00:58:48,700
this is,
this is,

1290
00:58:48,700 --> 00:58:50,920
this is after I'm on it.
You know what I mean?

1291
00:58:50,921 --> 00:58:55,180
So I didn't make any changes until I got
up anything until I got into mark's

1292
00:58:55,181 --> 00:58:59,320
protocol.
Started to like return to normalcy.

1293
00:58:59,350 --> 00:59:02,760
And then when you get to that level,
you start feeling really good again.

1294
00:59:02,770 --> 00:59:03,191
You're like,
well,

1295
00:59:03,191 --> 00:59:04,900
what else can I do?
You know what I mean?

1296
00:59:05,380 --> 00:59:06,850
And that's,
that's like been the steps that we've

1297
00:59:06,851 --> 00:59:09,940
seen in so many people.
Like we don't have to make any lifestyle

1298
00:59:09,941 --> 00:59:12,850
changes initially,
like thrill make them on their own.

1299
00:59:13,270 --> 00:59:17,510
So get them back to a homeostasis or
balance and neuro permissive environment

1300
00:59:17,511 --> 00:59:20,290
and mark as mark calls it.
And then you start looking at like,

1301
00:59:20,291 --> 00:59:22,730
well,
what else do I need to do in my life to

1302
00:59:22,760 --> 00:59:23,690
optimize it?

1303
00:59:23,720 --> 00:59:24,620
And for me,
man,

1304
00:59:24,621 --> 00:59:27,020
it was like,
I'm going to take a look at water,

1305
00:59:27,050 --> 00:59:29,150
I'm going to be taking a look at,
uh,

1306
00:59:29,210 --> 00:59:31,190
light,
sound,

1307
00:59:31,220 --> 00:59:33,560
emf,
like every external,

1308
00:59:33,590 --> 00:59:34,610
you know,
stimulus.

1309
00:59:34,611 --> 00:59:37,850
I want to optimize and make sure,
like it's as optimized as possible.

1310
00:59:38,540 --> 00:59:39,351
Well,
so,

1311
00:59:39,351 --> 00:59:41,840
um,
did you do any changes to the way you

1312
00:59:41,841 --> 00:59:44,420
exercise?
Let me think about that.

1313
00:59:44,450 --> 00:59:45,283
Not Really,
man.

1314
00:59:45,350 --> 00:59:47,750
Uh,
I was kind of into Olympic lifting at

1315
00:59:47,751 --> 00:59:50,480
the time and stayed with that.
Um,

1316
00:59:51,050 --> 00:59:51,900
uh,
physical,

1317
00:59:52,010 --> 00:59:54,200
physically,
always remain physically active through

1318
00:59:54,201 --> 00:59:55,470
the whole thing.
Um,

1319
00:59:55,500 --> 00:59:56,900
so not a,
probably the only thing that probably

1320
00:59:56,901 --> 00:59:58,160
kept you sane.
Yeah,

1321
00:59:58,280 --> 01:00:00,170
absolutely.
And another reason they said that I

1322
01:00:00,171 --> 01:00:01,400
lived through the,
uh,

1323
01:00:01,430 --> 01:00:04,880
the blood clots was the level of
cardiovascular fitness that I was in at

1324
01:00:04,881 --> 01:00:06,620
the time.
You know what I mean?

1325
01:00:06,621 --> 01:00:07,454
So,
uh,

1326
01:00:07,460 --> 01:00:08,121
yeah.
But yeah,

1327
01:00:08,121 --> 01:00:09,080
that was like,
you know,

1328
01:00:09,081 --> 01:00:11,270
one Goto,
like I just always worked out.

1329
01:00:11,270 --> 01:00:13,370
I've always been,
that's always been a part of my life.

1330
01:00:13,400 --> 01:00:15,380
And so that was always there.
So stuck with that.

1331
01:00:15,980 --> 01:00:19,580
So three months in,
how did you feel and what was the

1332
01:00:19,581 --> 01:00:22,760
difference?
I felt night and day different.

1333
01:00:22,970 --> 01:00:25,430
No more anxiety,
no more depression.

1334
01:00:25,610 --> 01:00:28,730
No more balance issues.
No more double vision.

1335
01:00:28,760 --> 01:00:31,490
No more blurry vision.
No more migraine headaches.

1336
01:00:31,910 --> 01:00:34,190
Uh,
no more memory problems.

1337
01:00:34,640 --> 01:00:38,250
Like back on,
like I could go back to operating and

1338
01:00:38,290 --> 01:00:39,350
you know what I mean?
And Oh,

1339
01:00:39,351 --> 01:00:42,980
hey,
33 disability according to the va

1340
01:00:42,980 --> 01:00:45,410
hundred percent service-related disabled
is what?

1341
01:00:45,411 --> 01:00:46,790
33?
What were they?

1342
01:00:47,060 --> 01:00:47,893
Oh Gosh,
dude.

1343
01:00:47,910 --> 01:00:50,870
Like I named them like uh,
everything,

1344
01:00:50,900 --> 01:00:53,960
every kind of psychological disorder
that you could think of,

1345
01:00:54,080 --> 01:00:57,200
like double digit like I was given,
you know what I mean?

1346
01:00:57,440 --> 01:00:59,270
Depressed,
anxiety,

1347
01:00:59,690 --> 01:01:01,520
insomnia,
so like psychotic.

1348
01:01:01,550 --> 01:01:02,361
Yeah,
just all,

1349
01:01:02,361 --> 01:01:06,680
all these different things and then just
a whole host of physical injuries as

1350
01:01:06,681 --> 01:01:08,510
well that they've been documented over
time,

1351
01:01:08,511 --> 01:01:11,450
but they're just like 33 disabilities,
100% disabled.

1352
01:01:12,470 --> 01:01:13,910
I don't,
I'm not missing a beat man.

1353
01:01:13,940 --> 01:01:17,780
I'm not in any chronic pain.
I don't have any symptomology of any of

1354
01:01:17,781 --> 01:01:22,100
those things and we've that's not
specific or special to me.

1355
01:01:22,130 --> 01:01:23,210
Right.
Like mark,

1356
01:01:23,211 --> 01:01:26,660
how can we've been able to take so many
dudes come off of their pain medication

1357
01:01:26,810 --> 01:01:30,480
without going into withdrawals like we
need.

1358
01:01:30,550 --> 01:01:32,000
You need to talk about that.
That's crazy.

1359
01:01:32,001 --> 01:01:35,270
Matthew was here.
Matthew was on 16 medications.

1360
01:01:35,271 --> 01:01:38,780
One of the medications was oxycontin.
He was on 80 milligrams a day.

1361
01:01:38,781 --> 01:01:41,660
He was a morphine sulfate,
240 milligrams a day.

1362
01:01:42,110 --> 01:01:45,060
He was on fentanyl patches and in six
weeks,

1363
01:01:45,250 --> 01:01:47,810
no patches.
Fentanyl patches on top of it.

1364
01:01:47,900 --> 01:01:52,070
Every anesthesiologists that I run by
with what he was on,

1365
01:01:52,071 --> 01:01:54,830
said the guy shouldn't be walking.
Well,

1366
01:01:55,070 --> 01:01:58,870
he flew down from,
from Washington to come his tolerance,

1367
01:01:58,871 --> 01:02:01,080
it must've just been off the charts
tolerance stuff,

1368
01:02:01,100 --> 01:02:04,790
tolerance and you know,
he had six pins in his draw,

1369
01:02:04,860 --> 01:02:07,910
shrapnel out of the left side of his
head and his right leg was shot.

1370
01:02:08,570 --> 01:02:11,270
And um,
that's the reason why they justify it

1371
01:02:11,271 --> 01:02:14,180
all his medications six weeks after
starting the protocol,

1372
01:02:14,240 --> 01:02:19,240
unique for him based on the biomarkers.
He was on two medications a year later,

1373
01:02:20,670 --> 01:02:24,000
he's off all his medications and he
moves to Hollywood to become an actor

1374
01:02:24,001 --> 01:02:26,670
and a screenwriter.
Totally function,

1375
01:02:26,700 --> 01:02:28,500
no pain.
We're going to fuck him up more than

1376
01:02:28,501 --> 01:02:32,190
anything else to go back on 17
medications,

1377
01:02:32,191 --> 01:02:33,570
right?
No,

1378
01:02:33,571 --> 01:02:37,380
but the question was,
I started seeing this pattern as andrew

1379
01:02:37,381 --> 01:02:38,790
brought up,
we're guys,

1380
01:02:38,791 --> 01:02:42,360
we're getting offered their medications
and no withdrawal.

1381
01:02:42,930 --> 01:02:46,240
So I went back to the literature and
started seeing the things about Nibin

1382
01:02:46,241 --> 01:02:49,950
all a and b receptors,
the more the opioid receptor alpha and

1383
01:02:49,951 --> 01:02:52,800
Beta the mu receptors.
And it turns out a lot of the things

1384
01:02:52,801 --> 01:02:57,570
that we do modify it and modulating.
And then more recently talking about

1385
01:02:57,571 --> 01:03:00,510
pregnenolone,
which is that mother of all hormones

1386
01:03:00,511 --> 01:03:03,870
that comes off of cholesterol,
where they're using it in people who are

1387
01:03:03,871 --> 01:03:06,690
addicted to Benzodiazepines,
which are,

1388
01:03:06,691 --> 01:03:07,950
you know,
valium and so forth,

1389
01:03:08,790 --> 01:03:12,180
where they have side effects from being
on such a high dose where they're

1390
01:03:12,181 --> 01:03:13,200
sleeping all the time.

1391
01:03:13,380 --> 01:03:18,030
They give him pregnenolone and it
decreases their fatigued during the day.

1392
01:03:18,390 --> 01:03:22,680
And it turns out that we're value more
benzodiazepines work on this thing

1393
01:03:22,681 --> 01:03:25,740
called the Gaba a receptor,
which is one of those relay stations.

1394
01:03:26,280 --> 01:03:30,360
Um,
pregnenolone is what is what should be

1395
01:03:30,361 --> 01:03:33,540
given instead of giving someone a
benzodiazepine.

1396
01:03:33,541 --> 01:03:38,541
So that's how we've been able to get all
our people off of antianxiety medication

1397
01:03:38,761 --> 01:03:42,570
has with this pregnenolone because of
how it functions and it's all out there.

1398
01:03:42,571 --> 01:03:45,270
I didn't invent anything.
It's just reading the literature.

1399
01:03:45,520 --> 01:03:46,890
That's incredible.
I love Brie.

1400
01:03:46,900 --> 01:03:50,070
So it fits into the same cell receptors,
the same receptor called the

1401
01:03:50,071 --> 01:03:53,400
benzodiazepine receptor on the Gabba a
that's crazy,

1402
01:03:53,401 --> 01:03:54,220
man.
Yeah.

1403
01:03:54,220 --> 01:03:57,120
You've seen dudes that were,
I didn't know what we were going to do.

1404
01:03:57,150 --> 01:03:58,380
And like they're,
I'm pain free,

1405
01:03:59,160 --> 01:04:00,750
no pain,
none.

1406
01:04:00,870 --> 01:04:02,880
And coming,
not coming off the meds with without

1407
01:04:02,881 --> 01:04:03,714
withdrawals.

1408
01:04:03,870 --> 01:04:04,680
Critics.
Were you,

1409
01:04:04,680 --> 01:04:06,780
did they put you on tramadol or,
yeah,

1410
01:04:07,330 --> 01:04:08,610
a man,
I don't even remember,

1411
01:04:08,611 --> 01:04:10,620
but it was,
it was a long time ago because he had

1412
01:04:10,621 --> 01:04:12,630
been off of it.
What are the things that disturbs me the

1413
01:04:12,631 --> 01:04:16,650
most about this is what if someone like
you wasn't around,

1414
01:04:17,130 --> 01:04:19,710
like what you're,
you're kind of an outlier in the medical

1415
01:04:19,711 --> 01:04:23,700
community that you've really gravitated
towards helping soldiers,

1416
01:04:23,701 --> 01:04:27,300
helping people with Tbi for athletes,
football players,

1417
01:04:27,930 --> 01:04:29,520
fighters.
What if you weren't around?

1418
01:04:30,120 --> 01:04:30,630
I mean,
I,

1419
01:04:30,630 --> 01:04:33,420
I'm not hearing about this from a lot of
guys.

1420
01:04:33,870 --> 01:04:35,730
Well,
Andrew and I,

1421
01:04:35,840 --> 01:04:38,820
uh,
in 2015 when my second third book came

1422
01:04:38,821 --> 01:04:42,330
out on traumatic brain injury,
when we started giving classes,

1423
01:04:42,630 --> 01:04:46,230
very inexpensive classes for docs to
come in and get trained.

1424
01:04:46,530 --> 01:04:49,890
So to date,
we've trained specifically on the

1425
01:04:49,891 --> 01:04:52,800
technology,
about 400 docs and they're going through

1426
01:04:52,801 --> 01:04:57,720
a process of training and exams and so
forth before they become part of our

1427
01:04:57,750 --> 01:05:00,270
network.
It's wire Angel Foundation Network,

1428
01:05:00,750 --> 01:05:02,850
uh,
so that we can disseminate the

1429
01:05:02,851 --> 01:05:05,520
information and have more people
involved.

1430
01:05:06,150 --> 01:05:09,930
But this is such an important thing and
it's such a common factor.

1431
01:05:10,050 --> 01:05:13,020
There's so many people that are
suffering from depression and anxiety

1432
01:05:13,021 --> 01:05:16,980
and all these different issues that very
easily could be attached,

1433
01:05:17,140 --> 01:05:18,490
traumatic brain injuries

1434
01:05:19,060 --> 01:05:21,220
and,
and people that don't even think they've

1435
01:05:21,221 --> 01:05:24,280
had traumatic brain juice,
sub concussive trauma.

1436
01:05:24,640 --> 01:05:26,530
There's,
there's a lot of people that have just

1437
01:05:26,531 --> 01:05:28,630
done,
they just been had a knock,

1438
01:05:28,660 --> 01:05:31,870
knock and tumble rough and tumble life
and then I'll realize it,

1439
01:05:31,871 --> 01:05:33,460
but they've caused damage to their
brain.

1440
01:05:33,610 --> 01:05:36,190
We see,
we have patients who come in under our

1441
01:05:36,191 --> 01:05:40,270
wellness program and when they're asked,
have you ever had any traumatic brain

1442
01:05:40,271 --> 01:05:41,440
injury?
They say no,

1443
01:05:42,220 --> 01:05:46,900
but you look at the bio markers and you
see the pattern that they've had head

1444
01:05:46,901 --> 01:05:48,460
trauma and then they say,
oh yeah,

1445
01:05:48,820 --> 01:05:50,480
when I was 18 there,
you know,

1446
01:05:50,650 --> 01:05:53,830
53 years of age or 47 years of age.
Oh yeah.

1447
01:05:53,831 --> 01:05:57,430
When I was 18,
I was in a car accident and I hit my

1448
01:05:57,880 --> 01:05:59,720
left side of my head against the,
uh,

1449
01:05:59,770 --> 01:06:01,510
driver's side window.
I did not,

1450
01:06:01,630 --> 01:06:03,280
wasn't knocked out,
didn't have nausea,

1451
01:06:03,281 --> 01:06:05,830
didn't have vomiting.
And you think because of that,

1452
01:06:05,920 --> 01:06:08,140
that you're immune.
Well,

1453
01:06:08,141 --> 01:06:12,970
it turns out that 85% of all traumatic
brain injuries are called mild for a

1454
01:06:12,971 --> 01:06:15,040
reason.
You don't have any symptoms.

1455
01:06:15,070 --> 01:06:16,720
Yeah.
Some people might have a little bit of a

1456
01:06:16,721 --> 01:06:17,590
headache,
uh,

1457
01:06:18,040 --> 01:06:19,690
you know,
or feeling fatigued.

1458
01:06:19,720 --> 01:06:23,320
But for the most part they feel nothing.
And then there's 15% that make up the

1459
01:06:23,321 --> 01:06:25,990
moderate to severe where they're in a
coma for periods of time.

1460
01:06:26,320 --> 01:06:28,360
And we've actually had people who were
in coma,

1461
01:06:28,450 --> 01:06:30,610
some of our vets who have been in coma
told,

1462
01:06:30,820 --> 01:06:31,720
uh,
connors,

1463
01:06:32,020 --> 01:06:33,250
who was told that,
uh,

1464
01:06:33,280 --> 01:06:35,410
he'll never walk.
He'll never be able to,

1465
01:06:35,820 --> 01:06:37,210
you know,
take care of himself.

1466
01:06:37,211 --> 01:06:38,860
He'll die young and so forth.
The Guy,

1467
01:06:38,861 --> 01:06:41,680
he's married and he's walking,
he's bicycle riding on,

1468
01:06:41,860 --> 01:06:42,551
on,
what is it?

1469
01:06:42,551 --> 01:06:45,690
Facebook.
He shows his pictures and so forth that,

1470
01:06:45,730 --> 01:06:47,170
listen,
this guy couldn't walk.

1471
01:06:47,770 --> 01:06:50,170
They told him he wouldn't walk again.
We've got three guys like that.

1472
01:06:50,200 --> 01:06:51,870
And what was,
what were they saying?

1473
01:06:51,871 --> 01:06:53,140
They want the,
uh,

1474
01:06:53,141 --> 01:06:56,530
the imaging,
right mark and still shows damage in the

1475
01:06:56,531 --> 01:06:57,490
what?
The gray matter.

1476
01:06:57,760 --> 01:06:59,110
Oh,
are the white matter and the white

1477
01:06:59,111 --> 01:06:59,410
matter.

1478
01:06:59,410 --> 01:07:04,000
But he's made new connections and so now
that's why he's able to do it because of

1479
01:07:04,001 --> 01:07:07,960
the protocols allowed him to go back
into this neuro permissive environment.

1480
01:07:07,961 --> 01:07:10,510
So what does that mean?
That means that he can experience new

1481
01:07:10,511 --> 01:07:12,460
things.
The brain is rewiring itself,

1482
01:07:12,490 --> 01:07:17,080
even though there's physical damage to
certain lobes because he can rewire

1483
01:07:17,081 --> 01:07:19,570
itself,
he can get better and he's walking.

1484
01:07:19,600 --> 01:07:21,880
We have got three guys like that.
It's crazy.

1485
01:07:22,180 --> 01:07:24,610
All the hormones that we talk about,
the testosterone,

1486
01:07:24,611 --> 01:07:25,444
estrogen,
progesterone,

1487
01:07:25,450 --> 01:07:28,570
we relate to them as gender hormones,
male or female.

1488
01:07:28,571 --> 01:07:31,240
We reproductive hormones,
sex hormones.

1489
01:07:31,640 --> 01:07:36,260
It turns out that each one of them has a
secondary function to Stastrom,

1490
01:07:36,280 --> 01:07:39,760
stimulates the immune system to increase
the white blood cells,

1491
01:07:39,790 --> 01:07:43,690
the CD four and cd eight which are the
protective kind of white blood cells.

1492
01:07:44,020 --> 01:07:48,790
It also decreases the inflammation in
our body called the t h one section of

1493
01:07:48,791 --> 01:07:51,730
the immune system and stimulates the
anti-inflammatory,

1494
01:07:52,120 --> 01:07:53,430
Estradiol,
progesterone,

1495
01:07:53,440 --> 01:07:54,810
pregnenolone,
now pregnenolone.

1496
01:07:54,820 --> 01:07:57,850
They all function to improve Alzheimer's
conditions.

1497
01:07:57,851 --> 01:08:02,170
So if you're an elderly male or female
with low levels of hormones and you're

1498
01:08:02,171 --> 01:08:06,070
starting to develop dementia,
you need to have your hormones looked at

1499
01:08:06,190 --> 01:08:11,170
because they regulate all these things
and to document it up the Kazoo or was,

1500
01:08:11,171 --> 01:08:13,000
what about the interpretation?
That's,

1501
01:08:13,170 --> 01:08:16,580
that's also where your unconventional
kariah standard means.

1502
01:08:18,500 --> 01:08:20,490
We've,
I've looked at it from uh,

1503
01:08:20,600 --> 01:08:21,860
a shift,
you know,

1504
01:08:22,430 --> 01:08:24,140
hormone x,
whatever it is,

1505
01:08:24,141 --> 01:08:29,090
has a range of 10 to 90 so you go to
your doctor and you get the blood tests

1506
01:08:29,091 --> 01:08:33,830
and it's 15 and you've got all the
symptoms as though you're at below 10

1507
01:08:34,070 --> 01:08:37,850
and the doctor says you shouldn't be
having any symptoms because you're

1508
01:08:37,851 --> 01:08:41,240
within that range that we called the
reference range.

1509
01:08:41,660 --> 01:08:46,250
But it turns out that not all of us are
identical genetically and function very

1510
01:08:46,251 --> 01:08:48,590
well at that specific level of 15.

1511
01:08:49,010 --> 01:08:52,970
So what we do is we bring people up to
what's called the median 10 on the

1512
01:08:52,971 --> 01:08:56,210
bottom 90 on the top,
yet it together you get a hundred you

1513
01:08:56,211 --> 01:08:58,820
divided by two and that's the
statistical median.

1514
01:08:59,060 --> 01:09:04,060
So we move people from that 15 all the
way up towards that 50 and some people

1515
01:09:04,221 --> 01:09:05,540
hit 20 and say,
Geez,

1516
01:09:05,541 --> 01:09:07,700
I feel better.
25 29.

1517
01:09:08,030 --> 01:09:11,620
And then there's a population who have
had the greatest amount of head trauma,

1518
01:09:11,630 --> 01:09:16,630
traumatic brain injury where they need
to go up between 50 and 75% and we still

1519
01:09:17,210 --> 01:09:22,210
keep everybody within the normal
physiological range as predict them by a

1520
01:09:22,730 --> 01:09:25,100
traditional medicine,
classical medicine.

1521
01:09:25,700 --> 01:09:28,190
And that's where we get the benefits.
And that's the reason why,

1522
01:09:28,790 --> 01:09:32,150
um,
a lot of these guys have had a missed

1523
01:09:32,151 --> 01:09:36,620
opportunity by their primary care doc to
improve them is because they are still

1524
01:09:36,621 --> 01:09:41,621
functioning under the old paradigm,
which in 1975 to major biostatisticians

1525
01:09:41,841 --> 01:09:45,200
came out with these two books that are
like eight pounds each.

1526
01:09:45,530 --> 01:09:48,470
And all they talked about is how all
this science,

1527
01:09:48,471 --> 01:09:53,270
all this chemistry that we do for people
that it doesn't apply to you.

1528
01:09:53,271 --> 01:09:55,730
And I,
it applied to the people that were part

1529
01:09:55,731 --> 01:10:00,731
of that study to set the standard range
or the reference range because I wasn't

1530
01:10:00,830 --> 01:10:02,780
part of that group.
So my,

1531
01:10:03,230 --> 01:10:05,690
what's normal for me wasn't part of
that.

1532
01:10:05,980 --> 01:10:10,980
So what the guy said was the two guys
said was what's best is to develop your

1533
01:10:12,441 --> 01:10:17,270
own reference range based on your body.
And he should do the same as I've been

1534
01:10:17,271 --> 01:10:21,650
doing over the past 60 years.
So a guy comes in and he's an 11 and

1535
01:10:21,651 --> 01:10:24,950
they tell him what he's normal in this
hypothetical situation,

1536
01:10:24,951 --> 01:10:26,870
he still has,
has all these symptoms,

1537
01:10:26,871 --> 01:10:29,060
right?
So what we do in a provocative to

1538
01:10:29,061 --> 01:10:31,790
stossel testing and the guy and I also
do it in females,

1539
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:34,280
is we test the theory out,
okay,

1540
01:10:34,430 --> 01:10:36,800
if it is the case,
I'm going to give you a shot.

1541
01:10:36,830 --> 01:10:40,760
What did you say you felt like for 60
hours since Cinderella?

1542
01:10:41,600 --> 01:10:43,670
Cinderella.
I got three daughters,

1543
01:10:43,960 --> 01:10:45,440
so I know,
I know that Disney well,

1544
01:10:45,470 --> 01:10:46,303
okay,
fine.

1545
01:10:46,700 --> 01:10:51,350
So he received his injection and he
drove on the full of five talk to Becky

1546
01:10:51,351 --> 01:10:55,180
for an hour and she told me the story,
like she was in amazement that it goes

1547
01:10:55,190 --> 01:10:56,470
that guy.
Yeah,

1548
01:10:56,480 --> 01:10:58,520
totally.
He didn't think it was me.

1549
01:10:58,521 --> 01:10:59,850
That was good.
So,

1550
01:11:00,140 --> 01:11:02,020
but anyway,
he sends back a,

1551
01:11:02,060 --> 01:11:04,250
what happens is after they get their
injection,

1552
01:11:04,280 --> 01:11:08,480
they send back five days later,
this questionnaire that says how well

1553
01:11:08,481 --> 01:11:10,550
they did.
And in big letters in the area,

1554
01:11:10,551 --> 01:11:11,990
that's for comments,
he says,

1555
01:11:12,590 --> 01:11:14,160
I felt Cinderella

1556
01:11:14,160 --> 01:11:18,620
after the ball and for 60 hours he was
just cruising.

1557
01:11:18,621 --> 01:11:22,440
And we're using physiological dosing of
testosterone.

1558
01:11:22,470 --> 01:11:24,090
I don't believe in,
you know,

1559
01:11:24,540 --> 01:11:27,420
everybody who comes to the office is not
abiding bodybuilder.

1560
01:11:27,570 --> 01:11:31,470
So we give physiological dosing because
if you give it more consistently,

1561
01:11:31,560 --> 01:11:35,340
they get a better response.
So he was given 60 milligrams of a

1562
01:11:35,341 --> 01:11:37,380
blended testosterone,
had a phenomenal,

1563
01:11:38,160 --> 01:11:39,660
you had a good response,
you could respond.

1564
01:11:39,750 --> 01:11:44,700
But the crazy thing is we're talking
about from 2014 we're in 2017 almost

1565
01:11:44,701 --> 01:11:46,130
2018 now,
where,

1566
01:11:46,200 --> 01:11:49,920
I mean we're less than four years and
all this change has happened.

1567
01:11:49,921 --> 01:11:51,540
Correct.
That's what's amazing that you've

1568
01:11:51,541 --> 01:11:55,800
started the warrior Angels Foundation,
that you have helped so many soldiers

1569
01:11:55,801 --> 01:11:58,500
since then that you've gotten the word
out through your foundation.

1570
01:11:58,680 --> 01:12:03,060
We're dealing with a very short amount
of time and so many people have been

1571
01:12:03,061 --> 01:12:05,250
helped to this amazing extent.

1572
01:12:05,760 --> 01:12:08,730
Correct.
And you know we asked people how'd they

1573
01:12:08,731 --> 01:12:13,200
hear about us and thank God that we
started back in two 14 on your show.

1574
01:12:13,201 --> 01:12:17,070
The first one,
so many people have commented to me,

1575
01:12:17,071 --> 01:12:19,740
look at,
if you see Joe would just thank them for

1576
01:12:19,741 --> 01:12:21,690
us.
We have lists and lists of people who

1577
01:12:21,691 --> 01:12:26,070
would like to thank you for the fact
that you believed in what I was doing

1578
01:12:26,071 --> 01:12:29,340
enough to,
to have us on the show the first time

1579
01:12:29,341 --> 01:12:32,280
back in 2014 separate Korean man and
people seek,

1580
01:12:32,300 --> 01:12:35,490
keep hearing it for the first time like
I ceased to.

1581
01:12:35,491 --> 01:12:40,491
It never ceases to amaze me every week I
get just a ton of mail from people who

1582
01:12:40,801 --> 01:12:42,300
heard it for the first time that like I
didn't,

1583
01:12:42,810 --> 01:12:44,580
I didn't think there was any solution
out there,

1584
01:12:44,581 --> 01:12:45,120
man.
Well,

1585
01:12:45,120 --> 01:12:46,860
I think this is a really good time to do
this.

1586
01:12:46,860 --> 01:12:48,060
Again,
this is one of the reasons why I was

1587
01:12:48,061 --> 01:12:51,720
excited about this because the podcast
has grown exponentially since then.

1588
01:12:51,721 --> 01:12:52,531
It's so,
it's much,

1589
01:12:52,531 --> 01:12:53,061
much,
the,

1590
01:12:53,061 --> 01:12:55,560
the audience is much larger now.
So I think we're going to be able to

1591
01:12:55,561 --> 01:12:58,320
affect and help a lot more people.
Um,

1592
01:12:58,350 --> 01:13:02,250
so for people that are interested,
people that want to find out more

1593
01:13:02,251 --> 01:13:04,860
information and then they want to try to
help themselves,

1594
01:13:05,040 --> 01:13:07,170
what's the best steps?
Well,

1595
01:13:07,171 --> 01:13:11,790
so we set up the organization.
We had such a outpouring because of all

1596
01:13:11,791 --> 01:13:14,340
the media,
like it was an overwhelming,

1597
01:13:14,400 --> 01:13:16,650
uh,
almost to get to everybody.

1598
01:13:17,040 --> 01:13:21,000
So basically what we do now is we grant
a millennium health centers so much

1599
01:13:21,001 --> 01:13:24,180
money and we were helped to subsidize
costs like that.

1600
01:13:24,181 --> 01:13:29,181
So they'll go with our grants to mark's
a facility.

1601
01:13:29,580 --> 01:13:31,500
They'll go there,
they'll fill out information,

1602
01:13:31,530 --> 01:13:32,880
uh,
through his website,

1603
01:13:32,881 --> 01:13:33,860
which is millennium.

1604
01:13:33,960 --> 01:13:36,000
Let's see,
Tbi med,

1605
01:13:36,060 --> 01:13:39,960
legal.com.
That's Tbi Med med,

1606
01:13:40,170 --> 01:13:42,870
legal.com.
They'll fill out a new patient

1607
01:13:42,871 --> 01:13:45,300
information packet,
put in all their information there.

1608
01:13:45,301 --> 01:13:48,270
Then they can be seen that way.
And let me tell you this about mark.

1609
01:13:48,300 --> 01:13:51,750
Every time I go to visit him for a
doctor's visit,

1610
01:13:51,990 --> 01:13:55,530
he won't let me pay.
He may make pay for other soldiers.

1611
01:13:55,650 --> 01:13:58,260
That's what he does.
He picks patients out and he goes,

1612
01:13:58,310 --> 01:13:59,370
well,
let's pick some guys out.

1613
01:13:59,371 --> 01:14:01,500
You're gonna pay for them.
And that's how he does it.

1614
01:14:01,620 --> 01:14:03,630
And You have,
they're appreciative.

1615
01:14:03,720 --> 01:14:07,320
Absolutely.
What you do as beautiful are the

1616
01:14:07,321 --> 01:14:08,670
corporation,
our corporation,

1617
01:14:08,671 --> 01:14:10,140
Millennium Health Centers,
inks,

1618
01:14:10,350 --> 01:14:12,250
uh,
has a fund.

1619
01:14:12,370 --> 01:14:17,370
And what it does is it underwrites a
portion of the veterans.

1620
01:14:17,830 --> 01:14:21,430
And then warrior Angel Foundation
underwrites another portion of it.

1621
01:14:21,850 --> 01:14:22,990
So,
you know,

1622
01:14:23,140 --> 01:14:25,570
revenue that we get from the,
um,

1623
01:14:26,020 --> 01:14:28,540
some of the products you sell and so
forth goes to help,

1624
01:14:28,590 --> 01:14:29,600
uh,
pay for it.

1625
01:14:29,760 --> 01:14:31,360
People have to pay for it,
Joe.

1626
01:14:31,361 --> 01:14:33,880
But we found that they need to have some
skin in the game.

1627
01:14:33,900 --> 01:14:34,810
Yep.
You know what I mean?

1628
01:14:34,811 --> 01:14:38,860
That that enables us to be met halfway.
So again,

1629
01:14:38,861 --> 01:14:40,930
we've subsidized the rate where we've
made it.

1630
01:14:40,931 --> 01:14:42,640
It's a form,
like it's affordable period.

1631
01:14:42,641 --> 01:14:44,710
But now it's really affordable.
Uh,

1632
01:14:44,740 --> 01:14:47,920
cause the insurance not taken for a
whole host of different reasons,

1633
01:14:48,430 --> 01:14:52,300
but so we've made it that way.
And so now like we used to handle every

1634
01:14:52,301 --> 01:14:54,640
case individually,
the warrior Angels Foundation and,

1635
01:14:54,850 --> 01:14:57,280
and fund them and,
and it was just a hipaa mess and,

1636
01:14:57,281 --> 01:15:00,670
and everything else.
So now we fund them directly and I've

1637
01:15:00,690 --> 01:15:03,820
worked to subsidize these rates and make
it affordable so we can help more people

1638
01:15:03,821 --> 01:15:05,140
get treatment and

1639
01:15:05,280 --> 01:15:07,880
talk about that,
about having skin in the game and how

1640
01:15:07,881 --> 01:15:10,250
important that is just psychologically
for people.

1641
01:15:10,251 --> 01:15:12,320
It seems like if you give people things
for free,

1642
01:15:12,350 --> 01:15:15,020
they just don't appreciate it as much as
you can make them work for it.

1643
01:15:15,260 --> 01:15:18,110
It's,
it's unfortunate because there's a lot

1644
01:15:18,111 --> 01:15:20,510
of people that really will work hard for
something.

1645
01:15:20,511 --> 01:15:22,250
They just don't have the financial
means.

1646
01:15:22,610 --> 01:15:26,060
But there's so many that that applies to
that.

1647
01:15:26,061 --> 01:15:28,310
If you just give it to them,
they don't appreciate it.

1648
01:15:28,311 --> 01:15:29,780
It's too easy.
It comes too easy.

1649
01:15:29,900 --> 01:15:32,090
Yeah.
Well fortunately very few people have

1650
01:15:32,091 --> 01:15:35,120
responded that way.
The vets have been really good.

1651
01:15:35,720 --> 01:15:39,860
They've heard about us from either your
show or from one of the shows or from

1652
01:15:39,861 --> 01:15:44,030
their colleagues who are in the program
and they see how well it is.

1653
01:15:44,031 --> 01:15:46,220
And they look at the how dismal their
life is,

1654
01:15:46,270 --> 01:15:47,690
right?
And they have a choice.

1655
01:15:47,900 --> 01:15:50,780
Make a choice.
You want to live the life that Andrew

1656
01:15:50,781 --> 01:15:54,710
had in the past or the enjoyment and the
love of life that he has now.

1657
01:15:54,770 --> 01:15:57,260
And how could someone like me donate?
Oh,

1658
01:15:57,261 --> 01:15:58,970
it's on our website.
Waf,

1659
01:15:58,971 --> 01:16:01,310
tbi.org.
It's a,

1660
01:16:01,311 --> 01:16:05,480
we're a five zero one c three,
so it's tax deductible and you can go in

1661
01:16:05,481 --> 01:16:08,630
there on top right is the uh,
donate.

1662
01:16:08,660 --> 01:16:12,140
Um,
we have a film coming out called quiet

1663
01:16:12,141 --> 01:16:14,060
explosions,
uh,

1664
01:16:14,090 --> 01:16:15,710
top.
There you go.

1665
01:16:16,620 --> 01:16:19,520
That uh,
that's our trailer right there.

1666
01:16:19,540 --> 01:16:20,960
Uh,
so we've got an emmy award winning

1667
01:16:20,961 --> 01:16:21,794
director.
Here it is.

1668
01:16:21,860 --> 01:16:23,690
Can you play that Jamie?
Go full screen.

1669
01:16:27,200 --> 01:16:30,170
The average of glass,
we have travels at 163 miles per hour.

1670
01:16:30,171 --> 01:16:35,171
It says
that's a great pick.

1671
01:16:38,050 --> 01:16:40,950
You got to see this video folks and
people that are just listening to the

1672
01:16:40,951 --> 01:16:43,290
podcast.
You've got to see the impact of these

1673
01:16:43,291 --> 01:16:44,110
blasts.

1674
01:16:44,110 --> 01:16:47,350
Explosive.
So any type of injury that we needed to

1675
01:16:47,351 --> 01:16:49,990
get into a place that was denied for
whatever reason,

1676
01:16:49,991 --> 01:16:52,450
be it a door or whatever,
I was the guy who would place those

1677
01:16:52,451 --> 01:16:57,451
charges to get us in.
You're not the person that you used to

1678
01:17:07,441 --> 01:17:09,770
be.
I can't remember things home.

1679
01:17:09,771 --> 01:17:09,980
I don't

1680
01:17:09,980 --> 01:17:11,540
know where I'm at.
Five years.

1681
01:17:11,541 --> 01:17:13,220
I've driven that route everyday.
All of a sudden look up.

1682
01:17:13,221 --> 01:17:14,054
You don't know where you're at.

1683
01:17:18,010 --> 01:17:19,030
I said to myself,
you know,

1684
01:17:19,031 --> 01:17:23,650
this is going to go one of two ways.
I continue on this path and it's going

1685
01:17:23,651 --> 01:17:26,410
to kill me.
Or I can make a decision to quit blaming

1686
01:17:26,411 --> 01:17:29,010
my circumstance and decide to act.

1687
01:17:30,130 --> 01:17:33,490
And it says in 2014 when you met Mark
Gordon,

1688
01:17:33,580 --> 01:17:35,890
hormone deficiency and suicide are

1689
01:17:36,760 --> 01:17:37,593
connected

1690
01:17:51,220 --> 01:17:53,140
for the people listening to something
you need to see.

1691
01:17:53,470 --> 01:17:58,390
It's just a lot of the text on the page
talking about the benefits of this and

1692
01:17:58,391 --> 01:17:59,840
how much it's helped.
Andrew and

1693
01:18:02,200 --> 01:18:03,490
what does the name of this video,
Jamie?

1694
01:18:03,491 --> 01:18:04,324
So people get

1695
01:18:04,620 --> 01:18:09,540
quiet explosions and we just started
production this month,

1696
01:18:09,660 --> 01:18:10,290
right mark?
Yeah,

1697
01:18:10,290 --> 01:18:11,220
correct.
This month.

1698
01:18:11,221 --> 01:18:12,230
And so,
uh,

1699
01:18:12,270 --> 01:18:15,090
if you want to donate to that,
you can donate there.

1700
01:18:15,091 --> 01:18:19,350
That'll also be a tax deductible in this
is a donation three that you guys are

1701
01:18:19,351 --> 01:18:20,260
doing.
And what do you mean?

1702
01:18:20,270 --> 01:18:21,840
We're going to do three,
uh,

1703
01:18:21,870 --> 01:18:24,810
three different stories.
All people through the foundation.

1704
01:18:24,811 --> 01:18:27,030
So we have two other crew,
incredible stories.

1705
01:18:27,390 --> 01:18:30,420
And then the top minds in a,
in science,

1706
01:18:30,421 --> 01:18:35,421
in neuroendocrinology and neuroscience
neuropathology are talking about

1707
01:18:35,881 --> 01:18:40,320
traumatic brain injury and the protocol.
So it's kind of a concussion,

1708
01:18:40,321 --> 01:18:42,270
you know what I mean?
Identified a problem.

1709
01:18:42,570 --> 01:18:45,630
We're identifying a solution.
So not only are we bringing out for the

1710
01:18:45,631 --> 01:18:47,190
first time ever,
you know,

1711
01:18:47,191 --> 01:18:50,670
what is the real underlying condition
behind traumatic brain injury.

1712
01:18:50,910 --> 01:18:53,040
Here's a solution,
here's all the science behind it,

1713
01:18:53,070 --> 01:18:56,310
here's the specialists in their field
confirming,

1714
01:18:56,550 --> 01:18:58,140
you know,
what the literature has been saying.

1715
01:18:58,170 --> 01:19:01,380
And so we hope to bring that out in
2019.

1716
01:19:01,470 --> 01:19:02,940
And what are you going to do with it
when you bring it out?

1717
01:19:03,120 --> 01:19:06,990
We're just disseminate the information.
Are you going to release it online?

1718
01:19:06,991 --> 01:19:08,760
You're going to release it in movie
theaters?

1719
01:19:08,830 --> 01:19:09,663
Yes.

1720
01:19:10,160 --> 01:19:10,993
Yeah.
All of that.

1721
01:19:11,510 --> 01:19:13,280
All of that.
As many places you can.

1722
01:19:13,281 --> 01:19:14,750
Absolutely.
Absolutely.

1723
01:19:14,751 --> 01:19:17,510
I'm not sure how it's gonna all be
distributed.

1724
01:19:17,511 --> 01:19:20,030
The goal right now is to disseminate the
information.

1725
01:19:20,120 --> 01:19:23,720
That's it.
As we have more potential individuals

1726
01:19:23,721 --> 01:19:25,550
who are suffering,
listening to this,

1727
01:19:25,970 --> 01:19:28,070
uh,
we've been training doctors,

1728
01:19:28,100 --> 01:19:31,220
we've been getting through multiple
avenues through the military,

1729
01:19:31,221 --> 01:19:32,350
through the different,
uh,

1730
01:19:32,390 --> 01:19:33,910
divisions.
Um,

1731
01:19:33,980 --> 01:19:37,760
getting them on board,
supporting US Navy Seal Foundation has

1732
01:19:37,761 --> 01:19:39,660
supported us.
Um,

1733
01:19:40,190 --> 01:19:44,780
that's all we're trying to do and we've
got enough ground swell in our

1734
01:19:44,781 --> 01:19:48,080
population to justify it.
As Andrew has said,

1735
01:19:48,081 --> 01:19:49,790
multiple times,
it's reproducible,

1736
01:19:50,540 --> 01:19:51,373
predictable,

1737
01:19:51,390 --> 01:19:53,550
and there's something that I want to
impart here.

1738
01:19:53,551 --> 01:19:57,930
There's a stigma with men in particular
in this country when it comes to

1739
01:19:57,931 --> 01:20:00,360
hormones and replacing hormones.
Um,

1740
01:20:00,390 --> 01:20:02,650
they're very embarrassed by it.
They don't like it.

1741
01:20:02,860 --> 01:20:05,170
It disturbs them.
Um,

1742
01:20:05,250 --> 01:20:08,010
and they start to think of it as
cheating or they start to think of it as

1743
01:20:08,011 --> 01:20:10,770
steroids.
They look at it in

1744
01:20:12,510 --> 01:20:16,290
an illogical way and that illogical ways
connected to,

1745
01:20:16,410 --> 01:20:20,790
I think in my opinion,
the stigmas in our culture that are

1746
01:20:20,791 --> 01:20:24,120
attached to performance enhancing drugs,
like for cheating in sports in the

1747
01:20:24,121 --> 01:20:25,800
Olympics.
And you always hear about them in this

1748
01:20:25,801 --> 01:20:28,890
sort of negative way.
So there's a lot of guys that they shy

1749
01:20:28,891 --> 01:20:30,750
away.
I've talked to many friends who are very

1750
01:20:30,751 --> 01:20:33,480
smart and they,
they talked to me about testosterone.

1751
01:20:33,481 --> 01:20:33,841
I'm like,
dude,

1752
01:20:33,841 --> 01:20:37,050
I've been on testosterone for 10 years
and make it changes your life.

1753
01:20:37,080 --> 01:20:38,730
It changes,
it changes the way you function.

1754
01:20:39,030 --> 01:20:41,850
I'm 50 years old,
my body functions like it did when I was

1755
01:20:41,851 --> 01:20:43,950
30 and that's a fact.
It really does.

1756
01:20:44,160 --> 01:20:46,230
And I pushed that motherfucker all the
time.

1757
01:20:46,410 --> 01:20:49,790
So I'm not,
I'm not telling you this from just a

1758
01:20:49,800 --> 01:20:54,000
theoretical standpoint.
I'm talking about from the physical

1759
01:20:54,060 --> 01:20:57,810
action perspective.
And I tell this to people and you see it

1760
01:20:57,811 --> 01:21:00,930
go in one ear and out the other.
I don't want to take any testosterone.

1761
01:21:00,931 --> 01:21:02,970
I don't want to,
I don't want to go to a doctor that's

1762
01:21:02,971 --> 01:21:05,940
gonna get me human growth hormone.
I don't want to look at my hormone

1763
01:21:05,941 --> 01:21:07,490
levels and like,
but you're,

1764
01:21:07,670 --> 01:21:11,240
you're depressed and you're tired all
the time and you're,

1765
01:21:11,241 --> 01:21:12,690
you're trying all these different
things.

1766
01:21:12,691 --> 01:21:16,230
You're taking Zoloft,
you're getting magnet therapy.

1767
01:21:16,231 --> 01:21:19,650
I know people who've gotten ketamine
shots and all these different things to

1768
01:21:19,651 --> 01:21:20,790
try to cure depression.
I'm like,

1769
01:21:21,030 --> 01:21:23,250
why don't you look at your fucking
hormones,

1770
01:21:23,251 --> 01:21:24,084
man?

1771
01:21:24,580 --> 01:21:25,480
Yeah.
They can look at,

1772
01:21:25,481 --> 01:21:27,430
it doesn't mandate that they have to
take it,

1773
01:21:28,090 --> 01:21:29,680
but they should know.
They should know.

1774
01:21:29,770 --> 01:21:32,530
Absolutely.
But what mark's talking about is your

1775
01:21:32,531 --> 01:21:35,020
physiological optimal level.
Right?

1776
01:21:35,021 --> 01:21:37,750
And so that hypothetical scenario that
he gave earlier,

1777
01:21:37,751 --> 01:21:39,940
if you're out at an 11 you know what I
mean?

1778
01:21:39,941 --> 01:21:42,940
And you're just once you know,
point above normal.

1779
01:21:42,941 --> 01:21:44,740
Well guess what?
That's not normal.

1780
01:21:44,800 --> 01:21:47,710
You know what I mean?
You're on the perceived lower end.

1781
01:21:47,711 --> 01:21:50,380
So he has a completely different sliding
scale to measure that.

1782
01:21:50,381 --> 01:21:54,370
But to me it would like be taken
objective analysis and just get a

1783
01:21:54,371 --> 01:21:58,210
snapshot of where that's at and like
maybe to see what it would be like to

1784
01:21:58,211 --> 01:22:00,370
push it up a little bit and see if life
improved.

1785
01:22:00,900 --> 01:22:02,620
Not,
it's super physiological,

1786
01:22:02,950 --> 01:22:05,560
physiological based on you in normal
healthy levels.

1787
01:22:05,561 --> 01:22:06,160
Yeah,
you might,

1788
01:22:06,160 --> 01:22:07,990
you might find out that,
hey man,

1789
01:22:07,991 --> 01:22:09,050
I went up,
you know,

1790
01:22:09,051 --> 01:22:11,590
10 points and I'm great,
or you had to push it really high.

1791
01:22:11,960 --> 01:22:12,850
You're different,
you know,

1792
01:22:12,851 --> 01:22:15,850
different strokes for different folks,
but I'm trying to figure out is why

1793
01:22:15,851 --> 01:22:20,851
would someone rather take a psychotropic
medication than fixing what God has

1794
01:22:21,011 --> 01:22:24,040
given our body to manufacture that
because of trauma,

1795
01:22:24,041 --> 01:22:27,610
because of genetics or whatever.
You're not producing it at the level.

1796
01:22:27,950 --> 01:22:32,950
And another fallacy for me,
a fallacy is that as we get older,

1797
01:22:33,250 --> 01:22:36,610
it's acceptable to have lower and lower
levels of hormones.

1798
01:22:36,640 --> 01:22:37,630
Well,
how about this?

1799
01:22:37,631 --> 01:22:40,420
The reason why they're getting lower and
lower is because of the shitty food

1800
01:22:40,421 --> 01:22:43,540
you're eating.
The fact that you had 60 years of

1801
01:22:43,541 --> 01:22:46,030
traumatic brain injury,
which have interrupted the brain's

1802
01:22:46,031 --> 01:22:49,600
ability to regulate homeostasis,
to regulate your hormone production.

1803
01:22:49,870 --> 01:22:53,140
That's the reason why the levels are
lower.

1804
01:22:53,200 --> 01:22:56,230
So bringing it back to 25 to 35 years of
age,

1805
01:22:56,231 --> 01:23:01,231
which has been the dictum in our office
for the past 27 years has been key.

1806
01:23:01,850 --> 01:23:03,440
Yeah.
One of the things that jumped my

1807
01:23:03,500 --> 01:23:07,930
testosterone up a bunch is cutting out
processed carbohydrates.

1808
01:23:08,410 --> 01:23:12,580
All the refined carbohydrates.
It just jumped it like 50% it was like

1809
01:23:12,581 --> 01:23:14,650
it doubled it and I was like,
this is insane.

1810
01:23:14,920 --> 01:23:17,920
Right?
So it tells you how important the

1811
01:23:17,921 --> 01:23:22,090
biochemistry is of the buddy of the body
to regulate other aspects of it.

1812
01:23:22,150 --> 01:23:26,020
Yeah,
and the Diet and exercise and sleep and

1813
01:23:26,030 --> 01:23:28,810
all these different factors.
But when I saw that my,

1814
01:23:28,811 --> 01:23:31,960
my testosterone,
it bumped up and then ultimately

1815
01:23:31,961 --> 01:23:33,070
doubled.
I,

1816
01:23:33,340 --> 01:23:37,420
I was so confused as to why it took me
so long to figure this out,

1817
01:23:37,600 --> 01:23:42,600
that eating pasta and bread and pizza
and all the bullshit was having an

1818
01:23:42,881 --> 01:23:47,410
effect not just on like body fat,
but it's having an effect on your whole

1819
01:23:47,411 --> 01:23:51,100
body being able to process all of these
chemicals.

1820
01:23:51,101 --> 01:23:55,180
You got to think of yourself as a
machine and people don't like to do

1821
01:23:55,181 --> 01:23:55,330
that.

1822
01:23:55,330 --> 01:24:00,010
But think of your body as a machine.
If you have a machine or an engine or

1823
01:24:00,030 --> 01:24:02,110
any,
or can think of it as a vehicle,

1824
01:24:02,400 --> 01:24:03,340
you're,
you've got to have,

1825
01:24:03,450 --> 01:24:05,290
yeah,
you need spark plugs.

1826
01:24:05,291 --> 01:24:07,480
You need cooling,
you need gasoline,

1827
01:24:07,481 --> 01:24:11,260
you need all these different factors and
if you don't have the proper amount of

1828
01:24:11,261 --> 01:24:13,930
engine oil,
if you don't have the spark plugs aren't

1829
01:24:13,931 --> 01:24:15,730
working right,
the vehicle is not going to work right.

1830
01:24:15,880 --> 01:24:18,730
Your body is far more complex than a
car,

1831
01:24:18,940 --> 01:24:23,940
but similar in that respect.
The an analogy I like car analogies.

1832
01:24:24,550 --> 01:24:27,160
Uh,
you've got a brand new porsche nine 11

1833
01:24:27,161 --> 01:24:32,161
carrera with four flat tires.
Choose one of them to fill up and drive.

1834
01:24:33,040 --> 01:24:36,600
You're not going to be able to before
cardinal harm hormones of our body and I

1835
01:24:36,601 --> 01:24:39,400
see colleagues of mine who only focus in
on one hormone.

1836
01:24:39,820 --> 01:24:44,650
How are you going to be able to have a
nice level ride if you don't look at all

1837
01:24:44,651 --> 01:24:49,651
for the key hormones and the also the
insanely complex way that all these

1838
01:24:49,751 --> 01:24:54,010
different nutrient levels and hormone
levels interact with each other and that

1839
01:24:54,011 --> 01:24:59,011
they're all a part of this incredible
system that takes forever to just

1840
01:24:59,441 --> 01:25:01,380
scratch the surface of understanding.

1841
01:25:01,690 --> 01:25:05,680
I mean I read a lot,
I've just scratched the surface of

1842
01:25:05,681 --> 01:25:08,740
understanding what's going on and I'm
not sure I understand it.

1843
01:25:08,920 --> 01:25:12,340
It is so complex,
but when you see the results,

1844
01:25:12,700 --> 01:25:15,190
you know that at least you're down the
right pathway.

1845
01:25:15,940 --> 01:25:17,070
It's a symphony,
you know,

1846
01:25:17,360 --> 01:25:19,240
that's what they always say it's a
symphony.

1847
01:25:19,241 --> 01:25:21,400
But how better did you feel,
you know,

1848
01:25:21,401 --> 01:25:23,620
after cutting out those things and your
testosterone better,

1849
01:25:23,670 --> 01:25:25,930
right?
Like almost immediately like the big one

1850
01:25:25,931 --> 01:25:28,200
was the not needing a nap.
Yeah.

1851
01:25:28,480 --> 01:25:30,010
You know,
like in the middle of the day I just

1852
01:25:30,011 --> 01:25:32,520
assumed that I would get up,
I would eat breakfast.

1853
01:25:32,550 --> 01:25:33,940
Then around three I'd be like,
fuck,

1854
01:25:33,941 --> 01:25:36,100
I need to crash.
It's testosterone deficiency.

1855
01:25:36,130 --> 01:25:38,860
Three o'clock does that.
And then there's also the insulin pump

1856
01:25:38,861 --> 01:25:42,070
right from the shitty process foods and
carbohydrates.

1857
01:25:42,430 --> 01:25:47,430
I came off all protocols that 2017 for
seven months for this year.

1858
01:25:47,760 --> 01:25:49,480
Cause just because I wanted to see what
would happen.

1859
01:25:49,960 --> 01:25:54,100
One I thought like the brain and body
went back to Nerpa miss of environment

1860
01:25:54,101 --> 01:25:56,530
and the hypothalamus and my pituitary
gland would turn back on.

1861
01:25:56,531 --> 01:26:00,280
But it wasn't the case.
We had two labs to followed up.

1862
01:26:00,760 --> 01:26:03,650
But I had to prove to myself,
I guess emotionally,

1863
01:26:03,651 --> 01:26:04,250
spiritually

1864
01:26:04,250 --> 01:26:05,060
that I,
you know,

1865
01:26:05,060 --> 01:26:07,850
I could slay that dragon and I could
live life without it.

1866
01:26:08,270 --> 01:26:11,800
But it wasn't,
it was no by no means of the imagination

1867
01:26:11,830 --> 01:26:13,250
optimized.
You know what I mean?

1868
01:26:13,700 --> 01:26:15,500
And then when I went back on it,
man,

1869
01:26:15,501 --> 01:26:19,970
like my body composition changed again
and I noticed increased energy and I

1870
01:26:19,971 --> 01:26:21,800
thought I was doing well,
but I was like,

1871
01:26:22,010 --> 01:26:25,040
life is better.
I'm a better person when this is

1872
01:26:25,041 --> 01:26:26,450
optimized.
And so,

1873
01:26:26,510 --> 01:26:28,760
you know,
I've proven to myself that I can do it

1874
01:26:28,790 --> 01:26:30,650
without it,
but life is not better.

1875
01:26:30,850 --> 01:26:33,440
I mean we use of it.
We might be looking at some time in the

1876
01:26:33,441 --> 01:26:37,760
near future where they can do something
genetically where they can alter the way

1877
01:26:37,761 --> 01:26:40,040
your pituitary gland functions are.
Some of the different things with

1878
01:26:40,041 --> 01:26:42,680
Crispr,
with many of these genetic manipulation

1879
01:26:42,980 --> 01:26:46,160
tools that they're working on right now.
But as of right now,

1880
01:26:46,280 --> 01:26:47,420
that's not the case.
No,

1881
01:26:48,500 --> 01:26:52,700
you have to get tested and then
replenish back to physiological levels.

1882
01:26:52,820 --> 01:26:56,050
All the hormones,
not a select all of them actually just

1883
01:26:56,060 --> 01:26:57,460
do one.
You can mess up the whole,

1884
01:26:57,690 --> 01:26:58,550
the whole thing.
Right.

1885
01:26:58,700 --> 01:27:03,700
Is there a network of doctors that
you've trained that you trust their work

1886
01:27:05,000 --> 01:27:07,640
that you can recommend?
Is there a way that people,

1887
01:27:07,641 --> 01:27:09,680
so they don't have to travel to
California to meet you?

1888
01:27:09,710 --> 01:27:10,050
Right.

1889
01:27:10,050 --> 01:27:11,370
Uh,
on the website,

1890
01:27:11,610 --> 01:27:12,990
um,
there's uh,

1891
01:27:13,020 --> 01:27:16,120
give that website out again,
a Tbi Med,

1892
01:27:16,121 --> 01:27:20,130
legal tb,
I m e d l e g a l.

1893
01:27:20,131 --> 01:27:22,470
Dot com has,
uh,

1894
01:27:22,590 --> 01:27:27,590
under Tbi network and training.
It has a list of doctors.

1895
01:27:27,901 --> 01:27:32,160
We've trained doctors in Spain,
United States,

1896
01:27:32,161 --> 01:27:33,990
Canada,
New Zealand,

1897
01:27:33,991 --> 01:27:37,410
Australia.
I'm going to Southeast Asia to train a

1898
01:27:37,411 --> 01:27:38,244
group,
uh,

1899
01:27:38,280 --> 01:27:43,280
in Cambodia and Vietnam for a project,
which is to establish centers in

1900
01:27:45,331 --> 01:27:48,390
Southeast Asia because there's a lot of
retired vets there.

1901
01:27:48,720 --> 01:27:49,620
Pull it up again,
Jamie.

1902
01:27:49,770 --> 01:27:53,210
A lot of retired vets to set up centers
so they can offer treatment.

1903
01:27:53,350 --> 01:27:56,710
And if you look at the website,
it's listed all in alphabetical order.

1904
01:27:56,711 --> 01:27:58,990
We have California,
there's Arizona there,

1905
01:27:59,020 --> 01:28:00,450
Colorado,
Florida,

1906
01:28:00,460 --> 01:28:01,293
there's,

1907
01:28:01,750 --> 01:28:05,320
my name's on it are people who are in
the process of getting their

1908
01:28:05,321 --> 01:28:08,890
certification.
So there's a four hour exam they have to

1909
01:28:08,891 --> 01:28:13,360
take and pass it with the least 70% and
then present two cases showing they have

1910
01:28:13,361 --> 01:28:16,570
the ability to uh,
utilize the information.

1911
01:28:16,830 --> 01:28:21,830
So there's doctors available in many,
many states and that's been our goal to

1912
01:28:21,931 --> 01:28:26,400
make this network of doctors where you
can reach people at scale in the same

1913
01:28:26,401 --> 01:28:30,480
way like train trainers are trained
doctors and that's what we're working on

1914
01:28:30,481 --> 01:28:33,840
with the government right now.
What's incredible is it how much you've

1915
01:28:33,841 --> 01:28:35,610
accomplished in such a short period of
time?

1916
01:28:35,970 --> 01:28:37,590
That's what's really incredible.
Obsessed.

1917
01:28:37,890 --> 01:28:38,940
Yes.
It driven,

1918
01:28:39,200 --> 01:28:41,160
totally driven better.
Uh,

1919
01:28:41,220 --> 01:28:44,130
there's nothing wrong in obsessed.
I'm obsessed with everything.

1920
01:28:45,120 --> 01:28:47,460
People have a hard time with that word.
They think it's like it's gotten away

1921
01:28:47,461 --> 01:28:48,780
from them.
Passionate.

1922
01:28:48,810 --> 01:28:51,720
Passionate is good.
I liked that as we're taking the action,

1923
01:28:51,721 --> 01:28:55,320
but like for the right reasons and like
opportunities just continues to present

1924
01:28:55,321 --> 01:28:57,480
itself.
I think that's just the byproduct of a

1925
01:28:57,570 --> 01:28:59,310
right way of doing things.
You know what I mean?

1926
01:28:59,311 --> 01:28:59,731
Like,
Hey,

1927
01:28:59,731 --> 01:29:01,190
let's be proactive.
Let's go there.

1928
01:29:01,210 --> 01:29:02,430
Let's make things happen.
Yeah,

1929
01:29:02,790 --> 01:29:04,620
let's go do it.
He said to me in the beginning,

1930
01:29:04,621 --> 01:29:07,890
he said,
we're going to be doing the right things

1931
01:29:07,891 --> 01:29:11,190
for the right reason.
And what'll happen is things will shake

1932
01:29:11,191 --> 01:29:13,110
out of the trees and land in front of
us.

1933
01:29:13,290 --> 01:29:15,120
And that's what basically has been
happening.

1934
01:29:15,630 --> 01:29:16,470
We just,
you know,

1935
01:29:16,560 --> 01:29:18,780
money.
It's not the issue.

1936
01:29:18,870 --> 01:29:23,850
Just get the work done in the response
and the reaction of our vets.

1937
01:29:24,030 --> 01:29:24,810
Well,
the reaction,

1938
01:29:24,810 --> 01:29:27,470
the response has been incredible as far
as like what I've heard and what,

1939
01:29:27,471 --> 01:29:29,850
what's come to me about it.
And uh,

1940
01:29:29,880 --> 01:29:31,880
hopefully we're shaking that fucking
Shit,

1941
01:29:32,310 --> 01:29:32,800
man.
Yeah.

1942
01:29:32,800 --> 01:29:34,240
Dude,
because of this show,

1943
01:29:34,241 --> 01:29:36,430
because of you,
like this information has been widely

1944
01:29:36,431 --> 01:29:38,050
disseminated man.
And uh,

1945
01:29:38,380 --> 01:29:41,650
you helped promote our book and give us
a blurb for that.

1946
01:29:41,651 --> 01:29:44,260
So thank you for that.
A tales from the blast factory,

1947
01:29:44,470 --> 01:29:46,810
uh,
supports what we're doing.

1948
01:29:46,840 --> 01:29:48,880
Uh,
that comes out next month if anybody's

1949
01:29:48,881 --> 01:29:49,714
interested in,
in that,

1950
01:29:49,810 --> 01:29:52,330
matter of fact,
we did a thing on Amazon,

1951
01:29:52,331 --> 01:29:53,830
Joe,
or they get it for 99 cents.

1952
01:29:53,831 --> 01:29:55,260
So we want people to get that book.
Wow.

1953
01:29:55,330 --> 01:29:56,250
Beautiful.
Yeah.

1954
01:29:56,600 --> 01:29:57,980
Beautiful.
All right.

1955
01:29:58,010 --> 01:29:58,880
So,
uh,

1956
01:29:58,940 --> 01:30:01,850
any closing thoughts that we need to get
out there,

1957
01:30:01,851 --> 01:30:04,490
if these people,
then we covered it all.

1958
01:30:04,640 --> 01:30:06,670
I think we covered it all.
Um,

1959
01:30:06,710 --> 01:30:09,320
you know,
my last closing statement is,

1960
01:30:09,321 --> 01:30:11,300
thank you so much.
Listen,

1961
01:30:11,301 --> 01:30:12,550
thank you.
I'm,

1962
01:30:12,600 --> 01:30:15,350
I'm,
I'm forever in your debt and I think

1963
01:30:15,351 --> 01:30:19,820
that what you guys are both doing is
incredible and I'm honored that I could

1964
01:30:19,821 --> 01:30:21,800
play a small part in getting this out
there.

1965
01:30:21,801 --> 01:30:23,300
It's just,
it means,

1966
01:30:23,810 --> 01:30:25,220
it means everything.
Thank you.

1967
01:30:25,250 --> 01:30:26,370
Thank you for the butter.
My heart.

1968
01:30:26,490 --> 01:30:27,440
All right,
fuckers.

1969
01:30:28,180 --> 01:30:30,440
That's it for the day.
We'll see you tomorrow,

1970
01:30:30,441 --> 01:30:34,060
but by
donate.
