sex toy from men.

6
00:00:15,910 --> 00:00:16,670
Steve,
do you have one?

7
00:00:16,910 --> 00:00:17,690
No,
I don't have one.

8
00:00:17,691 --> 00:00:18,780
I'm going to give you one.
Oh,

9
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:20,720
can you have one or do you have to hide 
that?

10
00:00:20,810 --> 00:00:22,580
No,
that's perfectly.

11
00:00:22,610 --> 00:00:24,260
That's best case scenario.
Steve.

12

Renovations in the house.

13

bitches.
Here we go.

14
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:33,000
The Joe Rogan experience.

15
00:00:43,270 --> 00:00:47,980
Ladies and gentlemen,
live May 10th,

16
00:00:48,070 --> 00:00:53,070
Tuesday,
2011 a year and several months before 

17
00:00:53,070 --> 00:00:56,230
the end of time.
Steve Reynolds easy has joined us.

18
00:00:56,260 --> 00:00:58,140
Thank God I got here now.
It's an official.

19
00:00:58,170 --> 00:01:03,170
I get mad.
I wouldn't want to be booked after the 

20
00:01:03,170 --> 00:01:03,170
end of time.
Yeah,

21
00:01:03,170 --> 00:01:06,021
you don't want that man.
You see written the Mississippi Shit is 

22
00:01:06,021 --> 00:01:06,021
crazy,
man.

23
00:01:06,021 --> 00:01:08,290
Fucking people that mother nature is not
fucking around.

24
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:11,100
The Mississippi River is like three 
miles password.

25
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:13,630
Supposed to be so many houses are 
flooded.

26
00:01:13,631 --> 00:01:14,830
So many Mrs.
Yeah,

27
00:01:15,410 --> 00:01:17,530
it's not supposed to be in the city of 
Mississippi.

28
00:01:17,531 --> 00:01:18,580
Yeah,
it's fucking water.

29
00:01:18,630 --> 00:01:20,420
Stay in Memphis.
Did their brain for awhile.

30
00:01:20,530 --> 00:01:21,660
Is that what happened?
Oh yeah,

31
00:01:21,661 --> 00:01:26,661
yeah.
They had rain and and you know there's 

32
00:01:26,661 --> 00:01:26,661
also there,
there were blowing down.

33
00:01:26,661 --> 00:01:30,781
The Army Corps of Engineers was blowing 
down levies on purpose to flood 

34
00:01:30,781 --> 00:01:33,430
farmlands weeks ago because they were 
worried about this happening.

35
00:01:33,970 --> 00:01:38,970
Yeah,
it's fucking essentially picking and 

36
00:01:38,970 --> 00:01:38,970
choosing which places they were like,
all right,

37
00:01:38,970 --> 00:01:39,730
you guys,
you guys will be all right.

38
00:01:39,731 --> 00:01:40,720
We'll,
we'll help you out.

39
00:01:40,721 --> 00:01:43,060
We're going to blow down the levies over
here so the water would rush out.

40
00:01:43,061 --> 00:01:46,910
So it wasn't going towards heavy 
populated residential area.

41
00:01:47,750 --> 00:01:51,790
It's crests in Memphis now.
The wow residents are being evacuated in

42
00:01:51,791 --> 00:01:54,160
the city of Memphis,
the city.

43
00:01:54,190 --> 00:01:56,560
God that is,
that's insane.

44
00:01:57,640 --> 00:02:00,240
See the river crest at 48 feet falling 
short of.

45
00:02:00,241 --> 00:02:02,100
It's all time record,
but still soaking lie.

46
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:05,270
Low lying areas have enough water to 
require a massive cleanup.

47
00:02:05,271 --> 00:02:06,300
They're fucked.
Yup.

48
00:02:06,810 --> 00:02:08,580
Did the crazy thing about something like
that too.

49
00:02:08,581 --> 00:02:11,910
It's like there's nothing you can do 
with all that water coming in.

50
00:02:11,970 --> 00:02:16,970
What are you gonna do you gonna build a 
new dam all and where's the water going 

51
00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:16,970
to go when you dam it up?
Where's it gonna go.

52
00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:18,090
You got to lake ready?
Did you build that too?

53
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:19,520
You can't do shit.
No,

54
00:02:19,650 --> 00:02:23,220
you just have to let it dry.
The rain again.

55
00:02:23,490 --> 00:02:28,490
Little baby existence is so fragile and 
we set up these camps next to these 

56
00:02:28,490 --> 00:02:32,010
natural things like rivers and oceans.
We just assume that while it's been this

57
00:02:32,011 --> 00:02:37,011
way for a year,
it's going to be this way next year and 

58
00:02:37,011 --> 00:02:37,011
a good spot to build a house.
I'm not that smart,

59
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:40,290
but do you think like when we were in in
the wilderness,

60
00:02:40,291 --> 00:02:45,291
right and floods happened,
they probably just didn't go as close 

61
00:02:45,291 --> 00:02:45,291
next time,
right?

62
00:02:45,291 --> 00:02:45,291
They probably over like,
all right,

63
00:02:45,291 --> 00:02:48,420
this is where the water came last time.
Let's move back a little bit.

64
00:02:48,980 --> 00:02:50,880
Well,
the bottom line is why are they building

65
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:54,510
still the.
The whole idea of living in one place is

66
00:02:54,511 --> 00:02:59,511
only a few thousand years old.
Just a few thousand years ago we were 

67
00:02:59,511 --> 00:03:00,190
nomadic.
What we would do is move

68
00:03:00,190 --> 00:03:05,190
where the animals went would move.
Where the animals went and then some 

69
00:03:05,190 --> 00:03:05,890
asshole figured out seeds and that's 
what fucked everything.

70
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:08,110
Once I could just get food wherever they
wanted to be,

71
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:10,090
I say it fucked everything up,
but I made everything awesome.

72
00:03:10,091 --> 00:03:15,091
Really.
Who the fuck wants to follow around 

73
00:03:15,091 --> 00:03:15,091
undulate herds of animals through the 
fucking savannah.

74
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:16,120
You know,

75
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:21,760
Joe,
I can't do your podcast because my 

76
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:21,760
family is leaving after a pack of 
Buffalo's later on

77
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:26,760
I'm going hunting,
hunting with Ricky Schroder and that's 

78
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:27,520
one of the options to shoot a buffalo.
Really trying to decide whether or not I

79
00:03:27,521 --> 00:03:31,460
want to kill a buffalo.
I'm killing a board with a gun rifle.

80
00:03:31,540 --> 00:03:33,310
Yeah.
I eat meat,

81
00:03:33,370 --> 00:03:34,390
you know.
And uh,

82
00:03:34,391 --> 00:03:36,910
I understand if you're an animal lover,
but look,

83
00:03:36,940 --> 00:03:41,940
it's way more cruel to see an animal go 
through this whole system of factory 

84
00:03:42,191 --> 00:03:46,150
farming and getting hung by their ankles
and get their neck cut and they kick and

85
00:03:46,151 --> 00:03:48,250
spasm some of the shit that you see in 
these videos.

86
00:03:48,260 --> 00:03:53,260
Man,
these animals have lived shit lives 

87
00:03:53,260 --> 00:03:53,260
forever.
I don't know how much of those videos is

88
00:03:53,260 --> 00:03:56,410
just one isolated,
terrible incident and one terrible place

89
00:03:56,411 --> 00:03:59,260
where they don't follow the rules or if 
it's widespread,

90
00:03:59,261 --> 00:03:59,680
you know,
it's,

91
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:04,700
it's really difficult because neither 
side wants to be totally honest about 

92
00:04:04,700 --> 00:04:06,130
how fucked up the whole raising animals 
thing is.

93
00:04:06,460 --> 00:04:11,320
But it's bad either way it's bad and I'm
trying to do my best to not eat anything

94
00:04:11,321 --> 00:04:12,310
that's.
I try.

95
00:04:12,390 --> 00:04:17,390
I'm trying to stop eating burgers.
I'm trying to stop eating anything that 

96
00:04:17,390 --> 00:04:20,770
I think is possibly factory farmed.
You can get plenty of organic meat,

97
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:23,200
like whole foods and shit like that,
you know,

98
00:04:23,201 --> 00:04:23,650
where,
you know,

99
00:04:23,651 --> 00:04:26,900
they're grass fed,
they're just wandering around and it's a

100
00:04:26,980 --> 00:04:29,380
better experience for the animal.
You know,

101
00:04:29,470 --> 00:04:31,780
I just think that uh,
the best way to do it,

102
00:04:31,781 --> 00:04:33,720
it's definitely hunting,
you know,

103
00:04:33,730 --> 00:04:34,660
and I've never done it.
So.

104
00:04:34,661 --> 00:04:37,330
And everybody who does it says it's this
crazy fucking primal,

105
00:04:37,350 --> 00:04:37,720
thrilled

106
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:41,250
brother-in-law kills a deer,
like right around Christmas.

107
00:04:41,251 --> 00:04:46,251
He goes with his buddies every year and 
then he kills it and cuts it up and he 

108
00:04:46,251 --> 00:04:47,580
keeps me.
It's big meat locker and he eats venison

109
00:04:47,581 --> 00:04:52,581
all winter long.
He's like every year I'm one of the 

110
00:04:52,581 --> 00:04:52,581
spring comes.
I'm done with the deer.

111
00:04:52,581 --> 00:04:52,581
You don't get one in the fall?

112
00:04:52,581 --> 00:04:54,380
Yeah.
If you shoot one venison in a one,

113
00:04:54,381 --> 00:04:57,410
one d or rather that venison can last 
you for fucking 10 months.

114
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,180
Freeze it.
Keeping the freezer.

115
00:04:59,181 --> 00:05:04,181
You're good to go.
You know how long a buffalo will last 

116
00:05:04,181 --> 00:05:04,181
you?
If I shoot this buffalo,

117
00:05:04,181 --> 00:05:04,790
I would have to give some of it away 
because I think some of you can't really

118
00:05:04,791 --> 00:05:06,440
even freeze them on the off.
Yeah,

119
00:05:06,441 --> 00:05:09,770
because you can't freeze like meat for 
more than six months.

120
00:05:09,771 --> 00:05:12,690
I don't know if this is right.
Yeah,

121
00:05:13,610 --> 00:05:14,690
there's a certain amount of time.

122
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:15,710
I don't know.
I,

123
00:05:15,711 --> 00:05:16,830
I eat chicken.
I'm like,

124
00:05:16,831 --> 00:05:18,390
how old is this?
Who Cares?

125
00:05:18,391 --> 00:05:20,430
It's frozen.
It's a big piece of ice.

126
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:26,080
It was random,
like back of your refrigerator or in 

127
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:27,090
your freezer?
In the freezer.

128
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:28,290
In the freezer,
you know,

129
00:05:28,291 --> 00:05:28,620
like,
yeah.

130
00:05:28,621 --> 00:05:33,621
You know,
I've talked about those bags of chicken 

131
00:05:33,621 --> 00:05:33,621
for $12.
I used to do that.

132
00:05:33,621 --> 00:05:33,621
I don't need more,
but I.

133
00:05:33,621 --> 00:05:35,580
I know exactly.
I've done it where you're like,

134
00:05:35,910 --> 00:05:39,390
I don't know what the expiration dates,
expiration dates scratched off.

135
00:05:39,391 --> 00:05:39,750
You're like,
ah,

136
00:05:39,751 --> 00:05:44,751
fuck it.
You know what's supposed to be really 

137
00:05:44,751 --> 00:05:45,360
bad when you free something and then you
thought out and then you refreeze it.

138
00:05:45,390 --> 00:05:46,270
Yeah.
You can't close.

139
00:05:46,290 --> 00:05:47,580
You've thought out.
You gotta eat it.

140
00:05:47,610 --> 00:05:50,550
Why is that?
Because I think fucking.

141
00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:55,700
No,
we should find that you shouldn't give 

142
00:05:55,700 --> 00:05:55,700
up hope.
Maybe.

143
00:05:55,700 --> 00:05:56,560
Maybe it's like the nutrients come

144
00:05:58,030 --> 00:05:59,960
out once.
I'm thinking halfway through that.

145
00:05:59,961 --> 00:06:00,770
I was like,
fuck,

146
00:06:00,771 --> 00:06:05,771
that's not sound good.
But nutrients can come out once I 

147
00:06:05,771 --> 00:06:05,771
didn't.
I didn't know that this straight though.

148
00:06:05,771 --> 00:06:10,430
Why is refreezing food bad?
And if you ever have a question you can 

149
00:06:10,430 --> 00:06:11,930
go to the goddamn internet if it will 
load up.

150
00:06:12,020 --> 00:06:13,670
I didn't know certain things went bad.
Like,

151
00:06:13,671 --> 00:06:18,050
like Campbell's soup or,
or spaghetti sauce tell you to keep that

152
00:06:18,051 --> 00:06:20,310
stuff in like panic rooms.
I can.

153
00:06:20,820 --> 00:06:21,740
That's what I'm saying.
Like,

154
00:06:21,741 --> 00:06:26,741
like I was looking at,
I think it was soup the other day or 

155
00:06:26,741 --> 00:06:28,230
maybe with pasta sauce in a glass 
container and that's been in the,

156
00:06:28,260 --> 00:06:30,000
in the cupboard,
but it's uh,

157
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:32,420
you know,
there was actually an expiration date on

158
00:06:32,421 --> 00:06:32,720
it.
I'm like,

159
00:06:32,721 --> 00:06:34,750
wait a second.
I didn't think she like,

160
00:06:34,850 --> 00:06:36,960
can Campbell's soup?
Goddammit.

161
00:06:37,060 --> 00:06:40,010
Did I really?
Maybe for legal reasons.

162
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:45,100
Maybe for legal reasons they have to in 
case you get sick or something like 

163
00:06:45,100 --> 00:06:45,100
that.
Yeah,

164
00:06:45,100 --> 00:06:45,100
that'd be.
I don't know.

165
00:06:45,100 --> 00:06:49,000
See who's calling be great.
Um,

166
00:06:50,150 --> 00:06:50,730
so,
uh,

167
00:06:50,780 --> 00:06:52,820
never killed.
I've never shot a gun.

168
00:06:53,060 --> 00:06:53,950
Never.
No,

169
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:56,270
not that I recommend.
It's kind of scary.

170
00:06:56,271 --> 00:06:57,290
Scary.
Here's how,

171
00:06:57,320 --> 00:07:02,320
why I'm scared about that.
Or I'm scared I'm going to get addicted 

172
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:02,320
to it.
I'm going to enjoy it a lot and then I'm

173
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:02,930
going to buy a gun.
Yeah.

174
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,910
But why are you scared about that?
Well,

175
00:07:04,911 --> 00:07:06,680
I don't know.
It's not me.

176
00:07:07,310 --> 00:07:10,400
It's that I just feel like if you have a
gun in your house,

177
00:07:10,401 --> 00:07:11,440
something will happen.
I have,

178
00:07:11,460 --> 00:07:16,460
I don't have a gun in my house.
I'm probably never going to get shot 

179
00:07:16,460 --> 00:07:17,430
with a gun in my house talking about.
Absolutely.

180
00:07:17,570 --> 00:07:19,070
That's ridiculous.
Way of thinking.

181
00:07:19,130 --> 00:07:24,130
Get a fucking gun to have one and not 
needed to needed and not have power 

182
00:07:24,130 --> 00:07:24,400
saying I've never shot a gun in my lazy.

183
00:07:24,550 --> 00:07:26,990
He pulled the trigger,
boom then goes off and I was afraid.

184
00:07:27,170 --> 00:07:28,940
I'm afraid that I'm going to get 
addicted to doing it.

185
00:07:28,970 --> 00:07:30,670
You're not retarded,
dude.

186
00:07:30,710 --> 00:07:35,710
You would be out there sucking Dick for 
crack money if you had that kind of a 

187
00:07:35,710 --> 00:07:35,710
brain.
Yeah.

188
00:07:35,710 --> 00:07:35,710
No,
no.

189
00:07:35,710 --> 00:07:38,240
I'm not gonna fucking gun.
I was scared to have one one.

190
00:07:38,241 --> 00:07:41,170
I used to do a lot of drugs and drink a 
lot because I thought like,

191
00:07:41,220 --> 00:07:46,220
oh,
it would be emotional and be tripping 

192
00:07:46,220 --> 00:07:46,220
out,
pull my gun out,

193
00:07:46,220 --> 00:07:46,370
not thinking,
and then I did some stupid,

194
00:07:46,550 --> 00:07:48,410
but now I don't really.
I still do that.

195
00:07:48,580 --> 00:07:49,660
It's a control issue.
If you,

196
00:07:49,661 --> 00:07:50,890
if you,
if you're worried about your,

197
00:07:50,891 --> 00:07:52,940
your own ability to control yourself and
you know,

198
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:55,550
there's a lot of hotheaded motherfuckers
that shouldn't have a gun.

199
00:07:55,551 --> 00:08:00,551
Right?
It's a lot of people have pulled the 

200
00:08:00,551 --> 00:08:01,901
trigger and then realized what they'd 
done afterwards and their whole life is 

201
00:08:01,901 --> 00:08:01,901
ruined.

202
00:08:01,901 --> 00:08:01,901
That's what I'm saying.
You're not that.

203
00:08:01,901 --> 00:08:02,060
I'm not that guy.
I'm not that.

204
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:03,830
You would have already had a bunch of.
I'm not that guy.

205
00:08:03,831 --> 00:08:04,900
You're that guy.
He wouldn't.

206
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:07,430
You've already have a bunch of self 
control issues.

207
00:08:07,460 --> 00:08:08,810
This is how I put,
I think in my brain,

208
00:08:08,870 --> 00:08:11,540
I say if someone broke into my house 
with my family there,

209
00:08:11,541 --> 00:08:13,600
right.
Whether or not I have a gun,

210
00:08:13,610 --> 00:08:15,280
I'm going to want to kill them.
I'm going to try to.

211
00:08:15,410 --> 00:08:16,610
If I don't have a gun,
I'm going to try.

212
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:18,800
If they're there,
if they're attacking my family,

213
00:08:18,801 --> 00:08:20,810
I'm going to try to find something that 
killed him.

214
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:23,030
Heavy gun will probably make that a lot 
easier.

215
00:08:23,870 --> 00:08:26,840
Probably try anyway,
so having a gun shot.

216
00:08:26,841 --> 00:08:27,570
Making.
Yeah,

217
00:08:27,980 --> 00:08:28,880
shotgun.
That's the move.

218
00:08:28,890 --> 00:08:30,330
Or just start collecting Lord of the 
rings.

219
00:08:30,331 --> 00:08:35,331
Swords to sound good enough.
You think you can kill a guy with a 

220
00:08:35,331 --> 00:08:39,651
sword?
I have a Samurai sword that's at my 

221
00:08:39,651 --> 00:08:39,651
house right now and I've been 
practicing.

222
00:08:39,651 --> 00:08:42,800
So you're ready.
I'm ready to do some fucking whatever.

223
00:08:42,830 --> 00:08:46,130
Quintin Tarantino type killing.
That's a fucked up way to kill somebody.

224
00:08:46,131 --> 00:08:51,131
Somebody killed broken to a guy's house 
and he got killed them with a Samurai 

225
00:08:51,131 --> 00:08:51,131
sword.
It was like a year or two.

226
00:08:51,131 --> 00:08:53,360
He had a Samurai sword that could go 
wrong.

227
00:08:53,390 --> 00:08:54,380
Fuck,
ed could get.

228
00:08:54,410 --> 00:08:56,100
By the way,
that guy could take it from

229
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:58,280
you and then you could die with your own
style.

230
00:08:58,290 --> 00:08:59,340
Samurai sword.
Oh,

231
00:08:59,370 --> 00:09:04,370
that would be the worst.
One of the worst baseball bats going to 

232
00:09:04,370 --> 00:09:07,301
be a bad one to this guy.
This guy from this website caught up 

233
00:09:07,301 --> 00:09:07,301
post apoc.
Uh,

234
00:09:07,301 --> 00:09:09,390
he sent me a knife in the past,
but now he just sent me this huge.

235
00:09:09,450 --> 00:09:12,480
He sent you,
went to one of those huge blades.

236
00:09:12,490 --> 00:09:13,830
Remember that,
that crazy night.

237
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:15,810
And so I'm like,
what do I do with all these knives?

238
00:09:15,811 --> 00:09:20,811
This guy keeps on site.
So I'm like hiding them around the 

239
00:09:20,811 --> 00:09:20,811
house.
So now I have one to under under my bed,

240
00:09:20,811 --> 00:09:22,110
like if I have a bad hooker or something
like that.

241
00:09:22,111 --> 00:09:26,270
If you have a bad hooker,
you're going to stab her with a knife to

242
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:31,280
keep up a putter and old potter next to 
my bed and then like one day it just 

243
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:31,280
broke apart.

244
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:31,530
I was like,
thank God.

245
00:09:31,540 --> 00:09:33,330
And now my buddies,
a cop gave you one of those,

246
00:09:33,770 --> 00:09:37,290
you know those ones that go and this 
thing pops out on baton.

247
00:09:37,350 --> 00:09:38,460
What are those?
Is that what it's called?

248
00:09:38,461 --> 00:09:42,780
The baton retractable thing.
Just locked us out.

249
00:09:42,781 --> 00:09:47,781
Right?
And it's metal and it's locked out and 

250
00:09:47,781 --> 00:09:47,781
it's metal.
You fuck somebody up with that badly.

251
00:09:47,781 --> 00:09:49,860
Do you remember those things that used 
to have when we were kids that were like

252
00:09:49,861 --> 00:09:52,290
leather and inside it was like lead 
pellets.

253
00:09:52,530 --> 00:09:53,790
What's it called?
The Black Jack.

254
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:59,600
Do you remember those?
My Dad used to tell me about those 

255
00:09:59,600 --> 00:09:59,600
things.
Yeah man.

256
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:00,480
Where whatever happened to Black Jack.
Pleased to have those people.

257
00:10:00,550 --> 00:10:02,610
Do you do just get whacked with those 
all the time.

258
00:10:02,630 --> 00:10:03,660
Wait.
So what's it look like?

259
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:06,720
It looks like sort of like a duck's 
beak.

260
00:10:06,870 --> 00:10:11,870
Okay.
But it's made out of leather and inside 

261
00:10:11,870 --> 00:10:13,260
of it is like lead pellets and it's got 
a handle on it and you know,

262
00:10:13,261 --> 00:10:18,261
it's like lead inside this leather and 
just crack somebody just kind of like a 

263
00:10:18,261 --> 00:10:19,530
more high tech version of like a sock 
with some marbles.

264
00:10:19,550 --> 00:10:21,030
Exactly,
exactly.

265
00:10:21,031 --> 00:10:23,280
It's led inside leather.
High Tech.

266
00:10:23,281 --> 00:10:24,090
Yeah.
Yeah.

267
00:10:24,550 --> 00:10:26,750
More a brass knuckles.
Yeah.

268
00:10:27,450 --> 00:10:32,450
Yeah.
Strong island boys used to carry around 

269
00:10:32,450 --> 00:10:34,950
breast necklace.
That's a terrible way to fuck up your 

270
00:10:34,950 --> 00:10:35,160
face.
Just pourable brass knuckles.

271
00:10:35,161 --> 00:10:37,830
I remember my buddy that wasn't in them 
bought one and I was like,

272
00:10:37,831 --> 00:10:42,831
what are you doing man?
It's like there's levels of shit that 

273
00:10:42,831 --> 00:10:42,831
people try to do.
The.

274
00:10:42,831 --> 00:10:44,820
It was like if you're using a weapon,
brass knuckles are a weapon.

275
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:45,960
Basically.
You're,

276
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:48,090
what are you trying to do?
You're trying to almost kill him.

277
00:10:48,140 --> 00:10:49,560
Are you trying to kill him?
What are you trying to do?

278
00:10:49,950 --> 00:10:51,990
Because this is like so weird.
Middle Ground,

279
00:10:52,170 --> 00:10:57,170
you know,
you can kill someone with brass 

280
00:10:57,170 --> 00:10:57,360
knuckles,
but it's not totally your intent.

281
00:10:57,570 --> 00:10:59,040
Right?
If you put brass knuckles on,

282
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:04,080
you're trying to beat the guy to death 
or are you just trying to really kick 

283
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:04,080
his ass easy?

284
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:04,080
Right.
You know,

285
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:04,350
it's weird,
right?

286
00:11:04,380 --> 00:11:09,380
Yeah.
I mean there was a kid in my college 

287
00:11:09,380 --> 00:11:09,380
that got into a fight and then hit a 
dude with a crowbar.

288
00:11:09,380 --> 00:11:11,900
Oh God killed him.
I killed the guy died.

289
00:11:11,940 --> 00:11:14,430
It's like you human,
you're going to Croak on your trunk.

290
00:11:14,460 --> 00:11:16,230
You don't that you don't know what 
you're doing.

291
00:11:16,260 --> 00:11:18,930
You're not like,
he wasn't trying to kill him,

292
00:11:19,410 --> 00:11:21,900
but it's like,
are you just trying to end it quickly or

293
00:11:21,970 --> 00:11:23,480
why?
That's a horrible result.

294
00:11:23,481 --> 00:11:27,170
You have to know your imagine taking 
somebody's life you took away.

295
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:32,280
Not when you're not planning.
I know a dude who was working as a 

296
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:35,900
bouncer and one of the guys who was 
working with punched a guy and the guy 

297
00:11:35,900 --> 00:11:36,390
fell down and hit his head on a curb and
that was it.

298
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:37,390
Yep.
Dead.

299
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:41,790
That's one punch.
That saatchis felt fucked up.

300
00:11:41,791 --> 00:11:44,580
And you know,
when people fall down outside too,

301
00:11:44,581 --> 00:11:48,180
people don't realize that when you fall,
it's like getting hit by the world.

302
00:11:48,420 --> 00:11:53,420
You know?
Imagine if somebody hit you from five 

303
00:11:53,420 --> 00:11:53,560
feet away with the earth,
you know,

304
00:11:53,561 --> 00:11:56,260
going 30 miles an hour or whatever the 
fuck it is in the fall.

305
00:11:56,410 --> 00:11:59,410
That's what it's like.
You know that that's not good.

306
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:01,060
When you get knocked out,
that's bad.

307
00:12:01,210 --> 00:12:06,210
When you get knocked out and you fall 
down and smash your head off the 

308
00:12:06,210 --> 00:12:06,210
concrete.
That's way worse.

309
00:12:06,220 --> 00:12:11,220
I see D,
I've seen her many times go into 

310
00:12:11,220 --> 00:12:12,760
seizures with a lock up and start 
snoring or making weird noises.

311
00:12:13,180 --> 00:12:14,530
That is so bad for you.

312
00:12:17,110 --> 00:12:18,270
Brass knuckles?
Yeah.

313
00:12:18,290 --> 00:12:20,110
Brass knuckles.
What is it?

314
00:12:20,111 --> 00:12:25,111
Whether we have those stores that would 
sell that shit and then we'd pipes 

315
00:12:25,111 --> 00:12:27,190
fongs.
You make up your fucking mind,

316
00:12:27,191 --> 00:12:28,450
man.
What do you want to do?

317
00:12:28,660 --> 00:12:30,850
Which side of the story you would have 
butterfly knives.

318
00:12:30,851 --> 00:12:32,730
Remember those butterfly knives or what 
was.

319
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:34,540
What was the deal with those stupid 
things?

320
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:37,360
Like what a stupid knife.
If you have to do a jazz mood before you

321
00:12:37,361 --> 00:12:41,230
take your knife out,
you're just like your fucking knife out.

322
00:12:41,540 --> 00:12:42,610
Just pull out the knife.

323
00:12:44,550 --> 00:12:46,710
I remember as a kid having one of those 
knife blades.

324
00:12:46,711 --> 00:12:49,140
That was a comb and you were allowed to 
bring it to school,

325
00:12:49,170 --> 00:12:53,610
like they didn't have a problem that you
were allowed to bring that up.

326
00:12:54,790 --> 00:12:58,510
Those were awesome.
It was just a thought.

327
00:12:58,511 --> 00:13:00,290
You were slick as shit.
When he pulled that bitch,

328
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:02,680
it was the same guy that thought of the 
cigarette.

329
00:13:02,780 --> 00:13:04,810
Candy rats are like,
what are you doing,

330
00:13:04,860 --> 00:13:07,990
man?
Weird fucking loophole that you can have

331
00:13:07,991 --> 00:13:12,310
candy that's pretend fucking poison.
They still sell that.

332
00:13:12,580 --> 00:13:17,580
They still sell those.
Could you imagine if they had candy for 

333
00:13:17,580 --> 00:13:20,251
kids that said he had a skull and 
crossbones on xxx poisoned death and 

334
00:13:20,251 --> 00:13:24,961
that was candidate.
What if you saw like the candyman 

335
00:13:24,961 --> 00:13:25,960
candyman and the kids were cutting up 
lines and snorting lines of?

336
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:26,980
Yes.
I don't know.

337
00:13:27,020 --> 00:13:28,300
What do you guys deal with?
Right?

338
00:13:28,410 --> 00:13:31,180
It's pop rock students.
It's a new way to do peds.

339
00:13:31,990 --> 00:13:36,390
You smash your peds up and you stuff it 
up your nose sniff snick from links.

340
00:13:37,790 --> 00:13:40,060
Why is it okay to have candy fucking 
cigarettes?

341
00:13:40,180 --> 00:13:45,180
Why can't I get one vial of Kale juice?
Everyone's shooting.

342
00:13:45,611 --> 00:13:48,290
You're shooting juice into your vein 
that everyone does it.

343
00:13:48,490 --> 00:13:50,230
No big deal.
It's awesome,

344
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:55,440
it tastes really good.
Stimulates a part of your brain that 

345
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:55,540
works on taste and it does it through 
your veins.

346
00:13:56,620 --> 00:13:58,120
Yeah.
What the fuck man.

347
00:13:58,150 --> 00:13:59,440
What's wrong with these cigarettes?

348
00:13:59,490 --> 00:14:04,490
What's funny is those candy cigarettes 
has denied that they actually sell them 

349
00:14:04,490 --> 00:14:07,431
stuff,
but they can't call them cigarettes 

350
00:14:07,431 --> 00:14:08,991
anymore.
So they call him like candy sticks are 

351
00:14:08,991 --> 00:14:08,991
so nice.
But.

352
00:14:08,991 --> 00:14:12,710
So they're a candy stick.
But when the [inaudible] read like it's 

353
00:14:12,710 --> 00:14:12,710
lit,

354
00:14:12,830 --> 00:14:15,530
the ones you used to,
they used to put like sugar at the end,

355
00:14:15,531 --> 00:14:17,270
you can blow it and it would blow out 
smoke.

356
00:14:17,540 --> 00:14:19,040
Oh Wow.
I never had the deluxe one.

357
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:20,840
Brian,
you did the uh,

358
00:14:20,841 --> 00:14:25,841
the fake cigarettes for a while.
The electronic cigarettes to try to get 

359
00:14:25,841 --> 00:14:26,480
off the cigarettes.

360
00:14:26,550 --> 00:14:27,780
Yeah.
Well it was when they,

361
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:31,380
when they first were starting to come 
over like maybe a year and a half,

362
00:14:31,381 --> 00:14:35,190
two years ago when they first started to
come over here from overseas.

363
00:14:35,420 --> 00:14:38,790
And so I had this idea like I was gonna.
I was doing a lot of reviews,

364
00:14:38,791 --> 00:14:40,470
like tech reviews and stuff.
So I thought,

365
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:41,760
hey,
I want to quit smoking.

366
00:14:41,980 --> 00:14:43,110
Uh,
I want to review this,

367
00:14:43,111 --> 00:14:45,480
so I contacted all these companies and I
was like,

368
00:14:45,481 --> 00:14:45,930
Hey,
you know,

369
00:14:45,931 --> 00:14:48,240
I want to review these things and make a
video out.

370
00:14:48,420 --> 00:14:51,270
So all these companies sent me the 
samples,

371
00:14:51,350 --> 00:14:56,350
products of their things.
So for a couple of weeks straight I was 

372
00:14:56,350 --> 00:14:58,280
smoking only electronic cigarettes and 
uh,

373
00:14:58,570 --> 00:15:02,150
they had a cigar version two that you 
love the cigar one,

374
00:15:02,151 --> 00:15:07,151
but uh,
but then I noticed that I was spitting 

375
00:15:07,151 --> 00:15:10,160
up blood and it's got a chemical,
a chemical used in a smoke machines,

376
00:15:10,161 --> 00:15:11,600
like a dance clubs and stuff like that.

377
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:13,470
Like a fog machine.
I forget the name of the chemical,

378
00:15:13,471 --> 00:15:16,280
a chemical.
But what one of the negative parts about

379
00:15:16,281 --> 00:15:21,281
that chemical is as it dries out,
it will dry you out to dry your skin 

380
00:15:21,281 --> 00:15:25,841
out.
Or if you put it in your throat it will 

381
00:15:25,841 --> 00:15:27,671
drive your fucking throw it out.
So I was getting like these lesions on 

382
00:15:27,671 --> 00:15:30,701
my throat from my throat being so 
fucking dry that I started spitting out 

383
00:15:30,701 --> 00:15:31,340
blood.
So I pretty much was like,

384
00:15:31,341 --> 00:15:32,560
fuck doing a review.
And I,

385
00:15:32,561 --> 00:15:34,460
I told all these people that sent me the
products,

386
00:15:34,470 --> 00:15:34,850
like,
look,

387
00:15:34,851 --> 00:15:36,970
I'm not going to do this review for you 
because I don't mind.

388
00:15:37,310 --> 00:15:42,310
I'm just going to bash what you're 
selling because bloody throat is a lot 

389
00:15:42,310 --> 00:15:44,930
different than fucking inhaling smoke.
You would ask the Co,

390
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:45,560
is it,
was it,

391
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:49,160
were they all electronic cigarette 
companies or were they other one?

392
00:15:49,161 --> 00:15:51,080
When I was trying.
Maybe they tried to put these,

393
00:15:51,630 --> 00:15:54,640
these magnets behind your ear lobe.
What?

394
00:15:54,710 --> 00:15:59,710
Yeah,
he gave me like these magnets that you 

395
00:15:59,710 --> 00:15:59,710
put behind your ear lobe.
I've seen now what is that?

396
00:15:59,710 --> 00:16:03,511
And then it was supposed to stop.
I don't know what it was supposed to 

397
00:16:03,511 --> 00:16:06,761
stop your cravings for smoking 
cigarettes and I'd never tried it.

398
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:08,280
I think that sounds like

399
00:16:08,510 --> 00:16:09,260
bullshit.
I'm sorry.

400
00:16:09,261 --> 00:16:14,261
This is kind of funny.
There's FDA release on these electronic 

401
00:16:14,261 --> 00:16:17,501
cigarettes is actually kind of funny.
The US Food and Drug Administration 

402
00:16:17,501 --> 00:16:21,551
today announced that a laboratory 
analysis of electronic cigarettes 

403
00:16:21,551 --> 00:16:25,781
samples has found that they contain 
carcinogens and toxic chemicals such as 

404
00:16:25,941 --> 00:16:30,941
Diane,
ethylene glycol and ingredient used in 

405
00:16:30,941 --> 00:16:34,600
antifreeze.
So amazing that they decided to release 

406
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:37,991
this press release.
What they're basically saying is the 

407
00:16:37,991 --> 00:16:37,991
fake poison is poison.
Yup.

408
00:16:39,390 --> 00:16:41,900
What about the real shit?
You fuck heads.

409
00:16:42,140 --> 00:16:47,140
Why are you releasing this on these 
electronic cigarettes and not clamoring 

410
00:16:47,140 --> 00:16:51,731
for the removal of cigarettes from 
fucking stores and grocery stores.

411
00:16:52,221 --> 00:16:57,221
I go to the grocery store and this 
goddamn cigarette carton area where you 

412
00:16:57,221 --> 00:16:57,221
can buy poison.
Yeah.

413
00:16:57,221 --> 00:16:59,550
You can buy addictive drugs that don't 
do anything for it.

414
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:02,200
Or they do something for you.
They stimulate your.

415
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:06,290
Like Steven King said that when he quit 
cigarettes is that he's writing actually

416
00:17:06,291 --> 00:17:07,550
suffered a little.
Really?

417
00:17:07,580 --> 00:17:07,930
Yeah,
yeah,

418
00:17:07,931 --> 00:17:08,150
yeah,
yeah.

419
00:17:08,151 --> 00:17:11,660
Hold a hard time.
Hard time firing his synopsis up when he

420
00:17:11,661 --> 00:17:11,810
was.

421
00:17:12,060 --> 00:17:13,560
Because 20 percent of his head is 
thinking,

422
00:17:13,561 --> 00:17:15,650
I want a cigarette,
I'll just go outside and Sarah,

423
00:17:15,700 --> 00:17:16,330
you know what I got?

424
00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:18,390
He says it's almost brain doesn't work 
as fast.

425
00:17:18,391 --> 00:17:20,050
I mean,
I know it's a stimulant and some sort of

426
00:17:20,051 --> 00:17:21,780
a does something,
you know,

427
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:24,500
I've almost,
I'm almost a year done.

428
00:17:24,550 --> 00:17:26,950
I quit by um,
hit me hypnosis.

429
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:27,820
Really?
Yeah.

430
00:17:28,170 --> 00:17:33,170
I went,
I got hypnotized three times and I on 

431
00:17:33,170 --> 00:17:34,330
the second one is the one you quit.
Never had a cigarette.

432
00:17:34,331 --> 00:17:35,470
I smoked on the way in.

433
00:17:35,910 --> 00:17:37,680
Whoa.
You smoked on the way in.

434
00:17:37,681 --> 00:17:42,681
They did the hypnosis.
The hypnosis thing to me seems to only 

435
00:17:42,681 --> 00:17:42,681
one work.

436
00:17:42,681 --> 00:17:46,170
If you really truly want it to work to 
prepare for it.

437
00:17:46,410 --> 00:17:51,410
You go in there like a little sort of 
under the agreement that you are going 

438
00:17:51,861 --> 00:17:56,861
to give into this experience and it's 
going to change you and if you believe 

439
00:17:56,861 --> 00:17:57,690
that it's almost like a placebo effect 
for the mind.

440
00:17:57,720 --> 00:17:59,790
Here's how it worked for me.
If you can get hypnotized,

441
00:17:59,791 --> 00:18:00,180
I can't.

442
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:03,790
I had said that I was never hypnotized.
Here's how I put it.

443
00:18:03,791 --> 00:18:06,190
If the doctor touched my Dick,
I would have known about it,

444
00:18:06,191 --> 00:18:09,220
but I wasn't at another area like I 
would've been.

445
00:18:09,221 --> 00:18:10,350
I wouldn't have been like,
oh,

446
00:18:10,390 --> 00:18:13,450
now I know someone says chicken and I 
start blowing everyone in the room.

447
00:18:13,451 --> 00:18:18,451
You never got to that point.
I don't know if I could ever be that 

448
00:18:18,451 --> 00:18:21,811
guy,
but I was in a place like he would get 

449
00:18:21,811 --> 00:18:22,080
me to a place where I was thinking about
other shit and he.

450
00:18:22,150 --> 00:18:25,000
I heard him like just being like,
you're not a smoker anymore,

451
00:18:25,010 --> 00:18:27,640
this is not part of your life and these 
are things that you don't do anymore.

452
00:18:27,641 --> 00:18:29,020
You don't need cigarettes.
It's not who you are.

453
00:18:29,170 --> 00:18:31,330
And he just kept repeating this shit.
But I was like,

454
00:18:31,570 --> 00:18:36,570
oh,
I want a beach and then look at the 

455
00:18:36,570 --> 00:18:37,951
fucking tits on that and then I'm like,
all like just going off in a different 

456
00:18:37,951 --> 00:18:39,670
place and he just kept talking to me and
then we'll be over.

457
00:18:39,730 --> 00:18:44,730
So you will,
you were listening to him and you were 

458
00:18:44,730 --> 00:18:44,730
fantasizing about other different 
things.

459
00:18:44,730 --> 00:18:49,230
I was thinking about other things,
like he would be like think about 

460
00:18:49,230 --> 00:18:49,230
whatever you want to think about and 
then you know,

461
00:18:49,230 --> 00:18:50,650
you start doing like,
I don't want to think about anything but

462
00:18:51,020 --> 00:18:53,560
yesterday when already told me,
do you want to think about the Ra?

463
00:18:53,570 --> 00:18:55,810
And then you need to.
You're all over the place.

464
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:59,380
You can't not,
you can't not just think about nothing.

465
00:18:59,770 --> 00:19:02,380
So while he,
while I'm off thinking about this,

466
00:19:02,381 --> 00:19:05,350
he's literally like whispering and put 
in a soft way,

467
00:19:05,620 --> 00:19:07,020
like just this,
these thing.

468
00:19:07,021 --> 00:19:09,250
And every once in a while I'd go back 
over here and be like,

469
00:19:09,251 --> 00:19:10,460
what is,
what the fuck are you saying?

470
00:19:10,461 --> 00:19:11,170
And be like,
oh,

471
00:19:11,180 --> 00:19:11,710
don't smoke.
Yeah.

472
00:19:11,711 --> 00:19:12,400
I don't feel like,
oh,

473
00:19:12,401 --> 00:19:17,401
but I'm back over here.
And he did that for like five or six 

474
00:19:17,401 --> 00:19:17,401
minutes.

475
00:19:17,401 --> 00:19:20,430
Wow.
To me that was the entire hypnosis part 

476
00:19:20,430 --> 00:19:20,430
of it.
But the beginning of it,

477
00:19:20,430 --> 00:19:21,940
like he'd start off every session with 
like,

478
00:19:21,970 --> 00:19:23,390
I knew I wanted to quit.
I,

479
00:19:23,530 --> 00:19:24,490
I,
I want,

480
00:19:24,560 --> 00:19:29,560
you have to want to quit.
But I would go in there and those 

481
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:29,730
conversations like,
you know,

482
00:19:29,731 --> 00:19:30,070
like,
Oh,

483
00:19:30,071 --> 00:19:31,450
you should quit smoking.
Yeah,

484
00:19:31,451 --> 00:19:31,930
no,
I know.

485
00:19:31,931 --> 00:19:32,590
I know.
Well,

486
00:19:32,591 --> 00:19:33,910
you know,
it's cancer and everything.

487
00:19:33,940 --> 00:19:34,290
Yeah,
no,

488
00:19:34,300 --> 00:19:39,300
I get it.
It's that conversation that lasts for 

489
00:19:39,300 --> 00:19:39,300
three minutes.
That now is.

490
00:19:39,300 --> 00:19:40,780
He's drawing it out for 40 minutes.
He's like,

491
00:19:40,781 --> 00:19:41,010
no,
no,

492
00:19:41,020 --> 00:19:42,760
it's not.
If you're going to die,

493
00:19:42,790 --> 00:19:47,790
it's one,
you're going to die and your son's is 

494
00:19:47,790 --> 00:19:49,361
going to come visit you in the hospital 
and he's going to go into the room and 

495
00:19:49,361 --> 00:19:49,361
he's going to see all the tubes going 
inside of you.

496
00:19:49,361 --> 00:19:50,380
How do you think that's going to make 
him feel,

497
00:19:50,410 --> 00:19:55,410
do you think he's good at and you just 
painting like worst fucking case 

498
00:19:55,410 --> 00:19:58,210
scenario and then he does the hypnosis 
thing and at the end it was um,

499
00:19:58,930 --> 00:20:03,930
gave me like a little mantra to say 
whenever I had a craving and I haven't 

500
00:20:03,930 --> 00:20:07,471
had a cigarette since,
since the moment I thought about it 

501
00:20:07,471 --> 00:20:07,471
today,
today,

502
00:20:07,471 --> 00:20:07,471
zero,
zero.

503
00:20:07,471 --> 00:20:08,160
And the first day maybe

504
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:10,160
you know,
your problem is Brian,

505
00:20:10,161 --> 00:20:11,420
you're a super,
super,

506
00:20:11,421 --> 00:20:16,421
super skeptical.
You're so skeptical you would never be 

507
00:20:16,421 --> 00:20:16,421
willing to give in to anything like 
that.

508
00:20:16,421 --> 00:20:19,580
My sister had it done and she audio 
recorded it and I,

509
00:20:19,581 --> 00:20:24,581
I wish I still had this cd because I 
used to listen to it in my car and 

510
00:20:24,581 --> 00:20:28,751
laughed my ass off and it was only one 
time for her that she went and it worked

511
00:20:28,821 --> 00:20:31,870
for two months,
but it was just like the,

512
00:20:31,930 --> 00:20:35,110
this chick saying stuff like,
cigarettes are going to grow us.

513
00:20:35,111 --> 00:20:37,400
Didn't make it up fat,
you don't want cigarettes.

514
00:20:38,050 --> 00:20:40,420
And my sister was like,
I don't remember in religious.

515
00:20:40,550 --> 00:20:42,920
Maybe this is some lady devised her own 
tech.

516
00:20:42,921 --> 00:20:44,110
Yeah.
Well,

517
00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:45,190
they all are their own.
I mean,

518
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:46,940
what,
what do you really have to say?

519
00:20:47,350 --> 00:20:47,980
You could,
we could

520
00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:52,980
put her phone number right now and say 
we're hypnosis and that we cure 

521
00:20:52,980 --> 00:20:55,860
cigarette people.
We probably have three people call us 

522
00:20:55,860 --> 00:20:55,860
tomorrow.
I mean,

523
00:20:55,860 --> 00:20:56,180
what's,
what credentials do you need to write?

524
00:20:56,360 --> 00:20:58,100
I don't,
I didn't ask for a fucking diploma.

525
00:20:58,101 --> 00:21:00,070
I was in this guy's living room,
like,

526
00:21:00,610 --> 00:21:05,610
you know,
like a garage area because there was 

527
00:21:05,610 --> 00:21:06,640
nothing nice around but I just got like 
through referral from another person.

528
00:21:06,641 --> 00:21:08,470
But like what do you need to,
you need,

529
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:10,410
you don't need to be a doctor to do 
hypnosis.

530
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:15,440
It's sort of a sketchy sort of a job 
psychiatrist is because most of them 

531
00:21:15,910 --> 00:21:19,030
don't really exist.
I mean there's some that psychiatry or I

532
00:21:19,031 --> 00:21:23,850
mean a hypnotic hypnotists,
hypnotists.

533
00:21:23,870 --> 00:21:26,560
It's like psychics,
like how is that real?

534
00:21:26,610 --> 00:21:31,610
You know what I mean?
Like when you drive down the street and 

535
00:21:31,610 --> 00:21:31,780
you see these fucking houses that a lot 
of psychics in their house,

536
00:21:31,781 --> 00:21:33,200
you know,
like psychic readings,

537
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:37,060
there's a lot down the street as I'm 
driving to go get something to eat.

538
00:21:37,070 --> 00:21:39,550
I'll see these houses and I think about 
stopping in.

539
00:21:39,700 --> 00:21:43,120
I did once when I was in New York,
like a neon sign at this psychic.

540
00:21:43,121 --> 00:21:44,590
Yeah.
And open it like one in the morning.

541
00:21:44,591 --> 00:21:45,190
Yeah.
Yeah.

542
00:21:45,191 --> 00:21:48,360
I went in and it was just a house,
you know,

543
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:52,210
it was a small house and it was in a,
it was in Manhattan some,

544
00:21:52,270 --> 00:21:57,270
I forget where it was somewhere.
I was doing an audition and I had like 

545
00:21:57,270 --> 00:21:57,850
an hour and a half to kill or something 
to go get a fucking psychic reading.

546
00:21:58,300 --> 00:22:01,270
This bitch couldn't have been more wrong
about things in my life.

547
00:22:01,300 --> 00:22:02,890
Like more wrong.
And how were you?

548
00:22:02,891 --> 00:22:03,790
Were you like,
nope,

549
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:08,050
I know you're very close to your father.
I haven't seen him since I was seven.

550
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:09,970
I was like,
it was that kind of shit.

551
00:22:09,971 --> 00:22:11,680
It was just worse.
She was terrible.

552
00:22:11,681 --> 00:22:12,940
I'm like,
you're just guessing.

553
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,500
And then I get angry.
I'll go you,

554
00:22:14,501 --> 00:22:17,370
this is just guy gave you $20 to fake me
out and guests.

555
00:22:17,490 --> 00:22:17,980
I go,
okay,

556
00:22:17,981 --> 00:22:19,650
thank you.
I learned those other.

557
00:22:19,810 --> 00:22:22,330
My lesson.
Those psychics are just like lazy people

558
00:22:22,331 --> 00:22:24,770
that bought a sign.
They're like,

559
00:22:24,820 --> 00:22:26,980
I don't want to leave the house anymore.
I'm just going to be a psych.

560
00:22:26,981 --> 00:22:29,470
Have they ever answered why?
If they were psychic,

561
00:22:29,471 --> 00:22:32,350
they wouldn't have an office building.
I don't know.

562
00:22:32,351 --> 00:22:35,320
Like Ge,
like everything,

563
00:22:35,860 --> 00:22:40,860
like have they ever answered that?
People have said that you can't use it 

564
00:22:40,860 --> 00:22:41,230
for personal gain.
I've heard that,

565
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:44,830
that you can use it for our cannot be 
used for personal gain.

566
00:22:44,850 --> 00:22:46,840
Jesus made this silly,
stupid thing.

567
00:22:46,841 --> 00:22:48,370
Is that like,
you don't think there's ever going to be

568
00:22:48,371 --> 00:22:49,880
one rogue psychic who's going to be 
like,

569
00:22:49,881 --> 00:22:54,881
I'm not following this shit.
I'm going to go fucking make a ton of 

570
00:22:54,881 --> 00:22:54,881
money.

571
00:22:54,881 --> 00:22:59,690
BEF In back to the future is like,
I got this book that tells me what the 

572
00:22:59,690 --> 00:23:00,550
fucking who's going to win every sports 
game when a bed on it.

573
00:23:00,551 --> 00:23:04,310
And you had like at enterprises and back
to the future two years,

574
00:23:04,740 --> 00:23:09,740
there's been a bunch of different people
that have offered huge rewards for 

575
00:23:09,740 --> 00:23:11,050
anyone to prove psychic ability.
You know?

576
00:23:11,090 --> 00:23:13,680
I think penn and teller had something 
going on with that for awhile,

577
00:23:13,690 --> 00:23:15,760
but they're,
they're very vocal about psychics.

578
00:23:15,761 --> 00:23:17,230
Been Bullshit,
you know?

579
00:23:17,410 --> 00:23:19,480
Hence the name of their show and they,
uh,

580
00:23:19,890 --> 00:23:24,890
there's been a bunch of other people.
No one's ever been able to prove that 

581
00:23:24,890 --> 00:23:28,060
there's a psychic ability,
the only psychic ability that has been 

582
00:23:28,060 --> 00:23:32,191
proven,
and this is a very odd one and we all 

583
00:23:32,191 --> 00:23:35,101
kind of knew about this one.
You can tell when people are looking at 

584
00:23:35,101 --> 00:23:35,620
you,
people can tell,

585
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:38,410
people are looking at you,
you know,

586
00:23:38,411 --> 00:23:40,540
you can't figure out what the fucking 
lottery is.

587
00:23:40,550 --> 00:23:43,360
You're not going to know who's going to 
win the world series in 2013,

588
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:45,890
but you can tell when are looking at 
you.

589
00:23:46,460 --> 00:23:51,460
It's a weird thing.
It's statistically proven that they've 

590
00:23:51,460 --> 00:23:51,560
done.
They've done controlled studies where,

591
00:23:51,561 --> 00:23:56,561
you know,
people were looking in another 

592
00:23:56,561 --> 00:23:58,391
direction.
I had to say when they thought someone 

593
00:23:58,391 --> 00:23:58,391
was looking at them and it was,
it was measurable.

594
00:23:58,391 --> 00:24:00,860
It was a measurable even from like 
behind or like your blind spots.

595
00:24:00,870 --> 00:24:02,390
And that would have to say that in 
those,

596
00:24:02,391 --> 00:24:06,080
any sort of a test situation,
that would be the worst time to be using

597
00:24:06,081 --> 00:24:08,760
some of that.
The Not using some,

598
00:24:08,780 --> 00:24:10,130
uh,
trying to,

599
00:24:10,131 --> 00:24:15,131
uh,
trying to do that because I would think 

600
00:24:15,131 --> 00:24:15,131
you'd be so aware that you're in a test.
You'd be so aware,

601
00:24:15,131 --> 00:24:18,050
okay,
I'm being judged me on high alert.

602
00:24:18,110 --> 00:24:20,120
Well not only that,
there would be all fucked up.

603
00:24:20,150 --> 00:24:25,150
They'd be all fucked up by this 
artificial situation where you're 

604
00:24:25,150 --> 00:24:25,150
monitoring your instincts,
you know,

605
00:24:25,150 --> 00:24:26,390
but I have this many times in my life 
where I was like,

606
00:24:26,391 --> 00:24:27,290
what's the fuck is going on?

607
00:24:27,290 --> 00:24:32,290
I turned and look at someone's giving me
the mad dog and I'm like doing my own 

608
00:24:32,290 --> 00:24:32,290
thing now.
Would it be like waiting in a,

609
00:24:32,290 --> 00:24:37,260
at a best buy just staring at someone 
just to see that person do your own 

610
00:24:37,260 --> 00:24:37,260
test?
12 15.

611
00:24:37,260 --> 00:24:39,830
They did not turn around.
I think it's not a hundred percent.

612
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:42,080
I think it's,
it's probably not even 50 percent,

613
00:24:42,170 --> 00:24:47,170
but I think there's something there that
every now and then pops in when someone 

614
00:24:47,170 --> 00:24:47,840
can just reach out with their energy and
touch you.

615
00:24:48,140 --> 00:24:53,140
And I think it's also probably has to do
with the kind of intent that they have 

616
00:24:53,140 --> 00:24:53,180
in their mind while they're staring at 
you.

617
00:24:53,420 --> 00:24:55,760
I think if someone's staring at you and 
like,

618
00:24:55,761 --> 00:24:56,690
um,
you know,

619
00:24:56,691 --> 00:24:57,290
and they're like,
oh,

620
00:24:57,291 --> 00:24:59,140
this guy seems like he's got his shit 
together.

621
00:24:59,160 --> 00:25:00,280
I liked the way he dresses,
you know,

622
00:25:00,630 --> 00:25:03,680
fucking got a cool t shirt on,
like maybe then you're going to be like,

623
00:25:03,950 --> 00:25:05,270
you know,
let him look at me.

624
00:25:05,340 --> 00:25:07,810
It's cool,
but I feel like,

625
00:25:07,820 --> 00:25:08,330
you know,
this guy,

626
00:25:08,331 --> 00:25:13,331
I think I could fuck him.
I'm pretty sure I could fucking just 

627
00:25:13,331 --> 00:25:13,760
fold them down fucking with a rock and 
keep them alive.

628
00:25:15,270 --> 00:25:16,340
You know what I mean?
Sorry.

629
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:17,760
Sorry.
Yeah.

630
00:25:18,050 --> 00:25:20,450
Then maybe it would come up.
He'd be like,

631
00:25:20,510 --> 00:25:22,760
don't be greedy with that.
Talk to me.

632
00:25:22,761 --> 00:25:27,761
You don't have to.
Just give me the eyes when you did that 

633
00:25:27,761 --> 00:25:27,761
target.
Steve wants.

634
00:25:27,761 --> 00:25:27,890
It's very comfortable for me to look to 
my left for some reason.

635
00:25:28,290 --> 00:25:30,530
I never have violent thoughts.
Perfect.

636
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:32,360
I was trying to attack from the left 
side.

637
00:25:32,420 --> 00:25:34,370
That's good.
I think that there's something,

638
00:25:34,371 --> 00:25:37,040
there's something to the human mind that
is not a,

639
00:25:37,070 --> 00:25:38,810
it's not static.
What,

640
00:25:38,850 --> 00:25:43,850
what we have right now,
our abilities right now are probably 

641
00:25:43,850 --> 00:25:47,801
evolving and our ability to recognize 
our environment and to tune into other 

642
00:25:47,801 --> 00:25:48,500
people.
I think that's probably evolving.

643
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:53,800
You know,
they say that just a few thousand years 

644
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:54,590
ago,
people could not read silently.

645
00:25:55,200 --> 00:26:00,200
This was a,
this was a trick that someone had 

646
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:00,200
learned how to do.
It was one of those,

647
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:04,060
one of the saints and one of the ways 
that this guy proved his St Hood was 

648
00:26:04,060 --> 00:26:07,810
that he could,
he could recite things that he had just 

649
00:26:07,810 --> 00:26:11,201
read.
He could close the book and he would 

650
00:26:11,201 --> 00:26:14,021
look at the book and not say anything 
aloud so they didn't know he was 

651
00:26:14,021 --> 00:26:16,751
reading.
He would read things and then close the 

652
00:26:16,751 --> 00:26:18,761
book and then tell you what he just read
and they thought that this guy was who 

653
00:26:18,761 --> 00:26:22,101
was a deity.
They thought that he was a priest or 

654
00:26:22,101 --> 00:26:24,820
they thought that he was a saint because
he had this ability that no one else 

655
00:26:24,820 --> 00:26:25,250
could do.
He could read silently,

656
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:28,910
like it makes sense you because you 
remember when you were a little kid,

657
00:26:28,911 --> 00:26:29,960
you couldn't read silently.

658
00:26:30,110 --> 00:26:34,160
You would,
you would read use stream dot,

659
00:26:34,220 --> 00:26:36,950
t v though,
you'd have to spell it out,

660
00:26:36,951 --> 00:26:41,951
you'd have to say it,
you'd have to make the noise and you'd 

661
00:26:41,951 --> 00:26:42,380
have to recognize that noise after you 
make it.

662
00:26:42,590 --> 00:26:44,910
Well then people learn how to make the 
noise in their head,

663
00:26:45,180 --> 00:26:47,310
you know,
they didn't always know how to do that.

664
00:26:47,490 --> 00:26:48,510
And this is,
it's,

665
00:26:48,620 --> 00:26:49,750
it's probably,
uh,

666
00:26:49,751 --> 00:26:52,090
an evolution of language,
you know,

667
00:26:52,330 --> 00:26:54,570
and evolution of the way we interface 
with language.

668
00:26:54,571 --> 00:26:59,100
But it's also like it may be something 
in our minds,

669
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:04,160
it may be something that we didn't have 
the ability to process before and we do 

670
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:07,491
now because written type and reading is 
very commonplace that we have developed 

671
00:27:07,951 --> 00:27:12,951
this ability to do this.
It's very possible that the minds that 

672
00:27:12,951 --> 00:27:12,951
we are working with are,
you know,

673
00:27:12,951 --> 00:27:17,450
much different than the minds of a few 
thousand years ago when there was no 

674
00:27:17,450 --> 00:27:19,090
mass media and there was no,
uh,

675
00:27:19,110 --> 00:27:20,760
there was no phones,
there was no nothing.

676
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:26,000
There's been a always been some weird 
speculation that people were able to 

677
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:30,501
tune into mother Gaia,
that some people were able to tune into 

678
00:27:30,501 --> 00:27:34,101
the forest and able to tune into 
information that comes from all the 

679
00:27:34,101 --> 00:27:36,480
animals and nature around you.
Like there was a show,

680
00:27:36,570 --> 00:27:39,150
Charles Kuralt on the road.
I know we've talked about this before,

681
00:27:39,270 --> 00:27:42,420
but there was a guy who used to live in 
Alaska and he said that he was,

682
00:27:42,430 --> 00:27:47,430
he was a prospector.
He would live out there by himself for 

683
00:27:47,430 --> 00:27:50,061
months at a time and after awhile he 
could talk to the animals with his 

684
00:27:50,061 --> 00:27:50,550
brain.
What really.

685
00:27:50,551 --> 00:27:53,190
And when he would come back into town 
eventually it would go away,

686
00:27:53,460 --> 00:27:55,560
but he had a,
he said there wasn't words,

687
00:27:55,561 --> 00:27:59,190
but there was a way of communicating 
with animals that you would have because

688
00:27:59,191 --> 00:28:02,070
you was no TV.
There was no radio there were you,

689
00:28:02,110 --> 00:28:03,960
you got tuned into different things.

690
00:28:04,050 --> 00:28:08,040
It sounds totally like horseshit,
but Dr doolittle.

691
00:28:08,220 --> 00:28:12,210
But if you talk to like the Indians or 
the natives in Peru,

692
00:28:12,360 --> 00:28:13,120
when they,
um,

693
00:28:13,280 --> 00:28:15,120
they,
they brew this Iowasca stuff.

694
00:28:15,121 --> 00:28:16,640
The psychedelic beverage.
Yeah.

695
00:28:16,830 --> 00:28:18,920
I'm Robin quivers went down.
Yeah,

696
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:22,710
well the thing about Iowasca is they've 
been doing it for 10,000

697
00:28:22,711 --> 00:28:27,711
years,
way before written history and then you 

698
00:28:27,711 --> 00:28:28,200
ask them how they learned how to do 
this.

699
00:28:28,230 --> 00:28:33,230
I mean the speculation is 10,000
years ago there was a real evidence is 

700
00:28:33,230 --> 00:28:33,230
probably only like a couple thousand 
dollars,

701
00:28:33,230 --> 00:28:36,300
but when they ask these people how they 
figured out how to do this,

702
00:28:36,360 --> 00:28:41,200
they say that the forest told them that 
the plants told them how to do this.

703
00:28:41,201 --> 00:28:43,830
I told them how to make this.
There's over 100,000

704
00:28:43,831 --> 00:28:48,831
different plants in the Amazon.
They figured out how to take the leaves 

705
00:28:48,831 --> 00:28:52,281
of one and the root and the vines of 
another and combine them because one of 

706
00:28:52,291 --> 00:28:57,291
them contains the chemical DMT and the 
other one contains what's called an Mao 

707
00:28:57,291 --> 00:29:01,311
inhibitor,
something called harmeet because you 

708
00:29:01,311 --> 00:29:01,311
can't eat this psychedelic stuff.

709
00:29:01,311 --> 00:29:03,930
You can't eat dmt because it exists in 
so many different things that if you eat

710
00:29:03,931 --> 00:29:08,931
it,
your body has the ability to break it 

711
00:29:08,931 --> 00:29:08,931
down inside your stomach with mano 
aiming oxidase.

712
00:29:08,931 --> 00:29:13,520
So this stuff called harming this other 
plant that produces this natural Mao 

713
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:17,691
inhibitor.
They have to mix this stuff in and they 

714
00:29:17,691 --> 00:29:18,120
have to boil it and they have to break 
it down over hours.

715
00:29:18,121 --> 00:29:19,680
Now,
how the fuck did these,

716
00:29:19,950 --> 00:29:23,460
these people living on dirt floors and 
huts with no books?

717
00:29:23,461 --> 00:29:28,461
How the fuck did they ever figure out 
how to take these plants and put them 

718
00:29:28,461 --> 00:29:28,461
together?
Well,

719
00:29:28,461 --> 00:29:29,520
they say that the forest told them how 
to do it.

720
00:29:29,670 --> 00:29:34,670
It sounds real thousand dead people.
Don't put those two together and then 

721
00:29:36,781 --> 00:29:38,250
use frank.
He's fucked,

722
00:29:38,251 --> 00:29:38,640
Bro.
Yeah.

723
00:29:38,641 --> 00:29:40,980
The real question is,
when did this information,

724
00:29:41,110 --> 00:29:42,950
the forest telling them to do this 
happen?

725
00:29:42,950 --> 00:29:44,950
Did it happen after they took the 
IOWASCA?

726
00:29:45,100 --> 00:29:47,740
Because that would make a lot of stuff.
Why do they just stop with Iowasca?

727
00:29:47,741 --> 00:29:50,950
Why wouldn't they just give us more?
Give us other good shit,

728
00:29:51,280 --> 00:29:52,630
dude,
you don't need anything else.

729
00:29:52,631 --> 00:29:54,640
Once you do the Ios,
you really don't.

730
00:29:54,641 --> 00:29:57,910
You Know Robin quivers is talked about 
it and you know,

731
00:29:57,960 --> 00:30:02,960
I've talked about it and I've,
I've told to standup tune dust and hope 

732
00:30:03,371 --> 00:30:08,371
into it.
There's a bunch of people that I know 

733
00:30:08,371 --> 00:30:08,371
that have had dmt in their life and once
you've done it,

734
00:30:08,410 --> 00:30:11,740
everything else seems completely silly.
Everything.

735
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:13,300
The,
the economy seemed silly.

736
00:30:13,301 --> 00:30:16,150
Your life seemed silly.
Driving and traffic seems silly.

737
00:30:17,260 --> 00:30:22,260
Media seemed silly.
Everything seems silly and juvenile and 

738
00:30:22,260 --> 00:30:22,260
temporary.
How well,

739
00:30:22,260 --> 00:30:22,990
what,
what is it?

740
00:30:23,270 --> 00:30:28,270
I mean,
it's not like a thing where you can go 

741
00:30:28,270 --> 00:30:28,270
on you.
You need like

742
00:30:28,270 --> 00:30:28,660
a week.
We'll need some time to digest it.

743
00:30:28,790 --> 00:30:32,020
You don't need,
you don't need time to do the drug.

744
00:30:32,021 --> 00:30:34,300
If you smoked DMT,
it only takes about 15 minutes.

745
00:30:34,301 --> 00:30:35,600
If you take Iowasca,
you know,

746
00:30:35,601 --> 00:30:38,020
orally active version.
It's a less,

747
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:43,320
less potent version of the experience,
but it's over a few hours as opposed to 

748
00:30:43,751 --> 00:30:45,580
over 15 minutes.
So,

749
00:30:45,900 --> 00:30:50,470
but what it is is the most trippy 
experience,

750
00:30:50,471 --> 00:30:55,471
the most bizarre outside of this world,
the most separate experience you could 

751
00:30:55,471 --> 00:30:57,280
ever possibly have.
And once you've had that,

752
00:30:57,820 --> 00:30:59,220
you know,
and you start talking about why,

753
00:30:59,221 --> 00:31:00,530
why doesn't he do other things?
What doesn't?

754
00:31:00,580 --> 00:31:03,310
He figured out how to make a fucking jet
car.

755
00:31:03,311 --> 00:31:05,200
You know,
one of the plants need to teach them.

756
00:31:05,201 --> 00:31:06,430
How to do that?
Yeah.

757
00:31:06,820 --> 00:31:11,820
You just want to go back to that world.
Those fucking people that live in the 

758
00:31:11,820 --> 00:31:12,280
Amazon man,
they like doing it all the time.

759
00:31:12,490 --> 00:31:13,840
They just do it.
They just,

760
00:31:13,841 --> 00:31:18,841
they just did this tune in to the spirit
world and astral travel on fucking 

761
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:20,890
illuminance snakes that fly through the

762
00:31:21,550 --> 00:31:26,550
a pot.
Different like can you go back and be 

763
00:31:26,550 --> 00:31:26,550
like,
ah,

764
00:31:26,550 --> 00:31:26,640
I wish.
Or is it something like,

765
00:31:27,010 --> 00:31:32,010
you know what I'm saying?
Does it make like the experience of 

766
00:31:32,010 --> 00:31:35,700
smoking pot like any different now at 
all that I think the less less important

767
00:31:36,461 --> 00:31:37,210
or less fun or.

768
00:31:37,330 --> 00:31:38,150
No,
I think that you.

769
00:31:38,151 --> 00:31:43,151
You first of all,
one time I had a flashback after I took 

770
00:31:43,151 --> 00:31:43,990
it from smoking pot.
I've never been able to do it again.

771
00:31:44,500 --> 00:31:49,500
One time I did DMT and then a week later
I was smoking weed and I had a 

772
00:31:49,500 --> 00:31:53,881
flashback,
a real flashback where I got to the 

773
00:31:53,881 --> 00:31:54,070
door.
There's a door to like when you,

774
00:31:54,100 --> 00:31:57,130
when you have the DMT experience,
very fucked up experience.

775
00:31:57,250 --> 00:32:02,250
And for those of you that are anti-drug,
and for those of you that are listening 

776
00:32:02,250 --> 00:32:02,250
to this,
that are like,

777
00:32:02,250 --> 00:32:06,631
you know,
what kind of fucking losers talking 

778
00:32:06,631 --> 00:32:06,631
about doing drugs and would go,
what the fuck is this stupid shit?

779
00:32:06,631 --> 00:32:11,401
And there's kids listening.
I think human beings owe an obligation 

780
00:32:11,401 --> 00:32:13,540
to tell the truth about their 
experiences and their.

781
00:32:13,541 --> 00:32:16,180
There is something to this that's very 
life changing.

782
00:32:16,181 --> 00:32:18,460
It changed me for sure.
It still is changing me.

783
00:32:18,760 --> 00:32:19,640
It's uh,
my,

784
00:32:19,670 --> 00:32:23,320
my dmt experiences for sure have made me
a better person,

785
00:32:23,350 --> 00:32:25,120
a nicer person,
more sensitive,

786
00:32:25,390 --> 00:32:27,220
more aware of the universe.
I'm not,

787
00:32:27,250 --> 00:32:32,250
I'm not,
I'm not perfect by any stretch of the 

788
00:32:32,250 --> 00:32:33,841
imagination.
I'm under a lot of pressure and 

789
00:32:33,841 --> 00:32:35,480
sometimes I snap at people.
I tried to keep it all together as much 

790
00:32:35,480 --> 00:32:37,090
as humanly possible,
but for sure I'm absolutely different at

791
00:32:37,091 --> 00:32:40,880
my core because of having a dmt.
All drugs aren't good for you,

792
00:32:40,881 --> 00:32:42,290
but some drugs are,
you know,

793
00:32:42,291 --> 00:32:44,430
and they're not too good for everybody.
You do what?

794
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:48,110
We should have fucking shamans.
We should have places where you could go

795
00:32:48,190 --> 00:32:53,190
where you could go to some professional 
place where this guy is sanctioned by 

796
00:32:53,190 --> 00:32:54,110
the community.
Now this is the guy that knows how to do

797
00:32:54,111 --> 00:32:59,111
mushrooms and you go to this guy's house
and he's got brilliant mushrooms and 

798
00:32:59,111 --> 00:32:59,320
they're all perfect and he grows 
himself,

799
00:32:59,400 --> 00:33:02,000
says there's nothing sketchy and how 
many mushroom trips you've been on?

800
00:33:02,060 --> 00:33:03,290
A thousand.
Okay.

801
00:33:03,380 --> 00:33:05,560
All right.
A thousand you're doing.

802
00:33:05,690 --> 00:33:07,190
How many grams we going to do today?
Well,

803
00:33:07,250 --> 00:33:08,990
this is what we're going to do.
You're going to be in this room,

804
00:33:09,020 --> 00:33:11,000
silent darkness.
You got to do five grams.

805
00:33:11,001 --> 00:33:13,100
I'm going to be outside the door.
I'm going to be totally sober.

806
00:33:13,101 --> 00:33:14,480
I have a phone,
I have a car.

807
00:33:14,660 --> 00:33:16,160
I can take it to the hospital if you 
need to,

808
00:33:16,340 --> 00:33:20,180
but the size of the freak outs really 
only in your mind and you're going to be

809
00:33:20,181 --> 00:33:21,770
fine physically.
Just don't worry about it.

810
00:33:21,771 --> 00:33:26,771
I've been there a thousand times.
Nobody dies from this shit and then you 

811
00:33:26,771 --> 00:33:29,171
could go and do it instead of being over
your friends house and you fucking 

812
00:33:29,171 --> 00:33:29,870
escape into the woods and then you get 
too fucked up

813
00:33:29,870 --> 00:33:31,150
for the words you don't know how to get 
back to you.

814
00:33:31,380 --> 00:33:36,380
So much better.
The second one instead by some creepy 

815
00:33:36,380 --> 00:33:37,110
dude sitting outside of a bedroom door 
with a phone call.

816
00:33:37,880 --> 00:33:42,880
But it's funny though,
but I wouldn't be called the police but 

817
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:44,240
like I do that now with like I called 
already today.

818
00:33:44,241 --> 00:33:45,530
I was like,
can you get me some breath strips?

819
00:33:45,531 --> 00:33:46,460
I'm going to vegas.
And he's like,

820
00:33:46,461 --> 00:33:48,170
all right,
this is the one you're getting.

821
00:33:48,171 --> 00:33:50,570
You take a third if you want this,
you take two thirds.

822
00:33:50,571 --> 00:33:54,710
If you want that hour to kick in,
five hours and a half hour later we'd be

823
00:33:54,711 --> 00:33:55,680
hungry.
Like it was.

824
00:33:55,700 --> 00:33:58,960
Ari is someone you can trust with that I
cannot trust Joey Diaz.

825
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:02,840
I know I'm telling you to take during 
the call me in an hour and 20 minutes.

826
00:34:02,890 --> 00:34:05,210
Our,
he's the guy that I asked him about that

827
00:34:05,211 --> 00:34:06,350
and about like mortgage rates.

828
00:34:06,350 --> 00:34:07,280
He's like,
don't take it yet.

829
00:34:07,281 --> 00:34:10,040
And I swear to God to the two things I 
trust them the most about.

830
00:34:10,041 --> 00:34:11,540
That's hilarious.
Beyond time.

831
00:34:11,541 --> 00:34:13,040
No,
to pick me up at the airport.

832
00:34:13,041 --> 00:34:16,130
No to not fuck my wife.
Probably not.

833
00:34:16,350 --> 00:34:21,350
He got a chance.
He would do it just for the story and 

834
00:34:21,350 --> 00:34:21,350
how to use Google.
But one time,

835
00:34:21,350 --> 00:34:25,421
one time we came,
I was driving him home from the comedy 

836
00:34:25,421 --> 00:34:28,621
store and we got,
I had to pick something up my house and 

837
00:34:28,621 --> 00:34:28,621
he goes,
can I just go into your room?

838
00:34:28,621 --> 00:34:29,300
And I was like,
for the Goof,

839
00:34:29,301 --> 00:34:30,350
okay.
And he puts on,

840
00:34:30,410 --> 00:34:32,630
he gets into bed and my wife's leaving 
there and gets into bed.

841
00:34:32,950 --> 00:34:36,290
He just curls up next to her and she's 
standing right there.

842
00:34:36,291 --> 00:34:36,560
She goes,

843
00:34:37,120 --> 00:34:38,200
what the fuck?

844
00:34:39,540 --> 00:34:40,540
And she smiled,
she goes,

845
00:34:41,010 --> 00:34:43,410
and our.
But I thought this was gonna be okay.

846
00:34:43,411 --> 00:34:46,400
And I just started laughing.
But you smelled them first.

847
00:34:46,500 --> 00:34:48,690
That's the best part.
She was like,

848
00:34:49,020 --> 00:34:52,250
you have a specific odor.
Do you smelled like cinnamon are just,

849
00:34:52,280 --> 00:34:54,340
you know,
bookstores,

850
00:34:56,350 --> 00:34:57,390
socks?
Yeah.

851
00:34:58,130 --> 00:35:01,170
That book that you find in the corner 
while cleaning your arteries,

852
00:35:01,320 --> 00:35:03,750
one of those tools that might not shower
for a week.

853
00:35:04,050 --> 00:35:05,820
He was.
We played basketball on Tuesdays.

854
00:35:05,821 --> 00:35:06,840
He's like,
just to warn,

855
00:35:06,870 --> 00:35:08,940
we played against each other.
Like just to warn you,

856
00:35:08,941 --> 00:35:11,380
I haven't showered in Sunday,
so are you serious?

857
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:14,100
When you take me down low.
Just remember that's the smell.

858
00:35:14,430 --> 00:35:18,720
That smells real purpose.
That's all I is.

859
00:35:18,870 --> 00:35:20,880
How he got fucking staff.
This guy,

860
00:35:20,881 --> 00:35:25,881
you know,
he had this huge fucking thing on his 

861
00:35:25,881 --> 00:35:25,881
knee from the.
It was from Jujitsu,

862
00:35:25,881 --> 00:35:28,450
but it was from not showering man.
GotTa shower right now.

863
00:35:28,460 --> 00:35:33,460
I'm not even dealing with it.
Like he didn't know there's something 

864
00:35:33,460 --> 00:35:33,460
wrong.
Said he got bit by a spider on my.

865
00:35:33,460 --> 00:35:35,340
If it wasn't for me,
noticing that he was limping,

866
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:37,800
he might be dead hug.
I'm not kidding.

867
00:35:37,801 --> 00:35:38,130
Staph

868
00:35:38,130 --> 00:35:43,130
infections can fucking kill you.
They really should have some shit up at 

869
00:35:43,130 --> 00:35:45,900
every Jujitsu gym showing you different,
like swollen things like see this?

870
00:35:46,110 --> 00:35:48,170
That that's a staph infection.
See this?

871
00:35:48,180 --> 00:35:49,710
This is impetigo.
This has herpes.

872
00:35:49,830 --> 00:35:51,350
This is.
You can get this shit from the mat.

873
00:35:51,351 --> 00:35:56,351
You've got to be careful.
This is what you gotta do right after 

874
00:35:56,351 --> 00:35:58,341
you get off the man.
You've got to wash yourself with some 

875
00:35:58,341 --> 00:35:59,820
probiotic like defense soap,
like eucalyptus oil,

876
00:35:59,821 --> 00:36:01,260
tea tree oil,
shit like that.

877
00:36:01,261 --> 00:36:06,261
Stuff that kills,
but do it right after you get off the 

878
00:36:06,261 --> 00:36:06,261
fucking Matt,
so you don't,

879
00:36:06,261 --> 00:36:08,370
you don't go home and sit around and eat
fucking pizza.

880
00:36:08,490 --> 00:36:11,860
You know,
like Ari shower for two more years,

881
00:36:11,880 --> 00:36:14,880
days.
There's the guy who is just too lazy and

882
00:36:14,881 --> 00:36:15,640
then there's the guys like,
oh,

883
00:36:15,641 --> 00:36:20,641
with tough guy,
I can go do whatever I want to do after 

884
00:36:20,641 --> 00:36:20,641
I'll go,
you know,

885
00:36:20,641 --> 00:36:20,641
whatever.
It's like,

886
00:36:20,641 --> 00:36:20,641
just be clean.

887
00:36:20,641 --> 00:36:22,290
He had a little volcano on his knee,
man.

888
00:36:22,380 --> 00:36:27,380
It freaked me out because we were were 
playing pool and he was limping and I 

889
00:36:27,380 --> 00:36:27,450
go,
what's going on?

890
00:36:27,451 --> 00:36:28,950
And told me what the spider bite I go,
let me say it.

891
00:36:29,130 --> 00:36:32,460
He pulls his pants up and he's got a 
little red volcano on his knee.

892
00:36:32,500 --> 00:36:33,540
Yeah,
that's right.

893
00:36:33,541 --> 00:36:33,930
Yeah.
I go,

894
00:36:33,931 --> 00:36:35,910
dude,
that's a fucking staph infection.

895
00:36:35,911 --> 00:36:40,911
You need to go to a hospital right now.
I unscrewed my queue and what your 

896
00:36:40,911 --> 00:36:40,911
servers.
I go,

897
00:36:40,911 --> 00:36:41,220
I'm deadly serious.
I go,

898
00:36:41,221 --> 00:36:42,930
you need to go to a hospital this 
moment.

899
00:36:42,931 --> 00:36:47,931
Don't wait an hour.
You need to go right now and you could 

900
00:36:47,931 --> 00:36:47,931
die.

901
00:36:47,931 --> 00:36:48,270
I had to staph infections.
Am I like fuck.

902
00:36:48,420 --> 00:36:53,420
And uh,
they had to put like a theater stuff 

903
00:36:53,420 --> 00:36:54,180
like gauze in there and leave it there 
for a week and then pull it out.

904
00:36:54,270 --> 00:36:55,130
Yeah,
that's it.

905
00:36:55,150 --> 00:36:56,310
It was horrible.
How'd you get it?

906
00:36:56,610 --> 00:36:57,180
Basketball.

907
00:36:57,810 --> 00:37:00,060
It's all about sports.
That's why I've never had a staff.

908
00:37:00,650 --> 00:37:04,800
It's really washing yourself afterwards.
It's also taking probiotics.

909
00:37:04,830 --> 00:37:06,780
You go to take a bunch of different 
probiotics.

910
00:37:06,990 --> 00:37:08,310
You know what?
I'd like this probiotic,

911
00:37:08,430 --> 00:37:10,560
Kimchi,
pickled cabbage.

912
00:37:11,060 --> 00:37:12,500
You get that from.
It's delicious.

913
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:16,670
It's a hostile cabbage fan.
Cabbage rolls with throwing.

914
00:37:16,710 --> 00:37:18,420
You gotta try.
So I'll give you some afterwards.

915
00:37:18,540 --> 00:37:20,580
Sauerkraut and cabbage.
It's spicy though.

916
00:37:20,581 --> 00:37:25,581
It's like a spicy Korean cabbage,
but you can get it at some organic 

917
00:37:25,581 --> 00:37:25,581
places.
And it's probiotic.

918
00:37:25,581 --> 00:37:29,901
Will they do is they take the cabbage 
and they leave it out for like a few 

919
00:37:29,901 --> 00:37:30,720
days and then you know,
you pick a lit with a bunch of different

920
00:37:30,721 --> 00:37:32,280
things.
I don't know exactly the whole process,

921
00:37:32,281 --> 00:37:37,281
but the whole idea is that getting live 
organisms into your body that are 

922
00:37:37,281 --> 00:37:37,281
healthy,
you know,

923
00:37:37,281 --> 00:37:39,930
that's really important to do after 
you've had a colonic.

924
00:37:40,110 --> 00:37:42,600
If you want to get water blown into your
asshole.

925
00:37:42,660 --> 00:37:45,030
I've done it twice.
Have you done the bullshit?

926
00:37:45,090 --> 00:37:46,410
I'm thinking about doing it.
I did it.

927
00:37:46,411 --> 00:37:47,910
I've heard it's bullshit.
I've heard it's awesome.

928
00:37:47,911 --> 00:37:48,290
I don't know.

929
00:37:48,540 --> 00:37:51,450
I did it today was a tough.
This one.

930
00:37:51,451 --> 00:37:52,800
Late night.
This is going to be awful.

931
00:37:52,801 --> 00:37:54,510
All right.
This one lady did it.

932
00:37:54,511 --> 00:37:56,040
The first lady that went to,
right?

933
00:37:56,100 --> 00:37:58,320
She did it and it didn't hurt that bad 
and it was.

934
00:37:58,321 --> 00:38:00,060
Wasn't as awkward as I thought it was 
going to be,

935
00:38:00,300 --> 00:38:02,460
so I made a point with this lady to do 
it again.

936
00:38:03,420 --> 00:38:05,540
She,
they call me like,

937
00:38:05,940 --> 00:38:08,210
this lady's tough to get to.
You have to want it.

938
00:38:08,220 --> 00:38:08,730
I'm like,
yeah,

939
00:38:09,390 --> 00:38:12,180
my wife's water breaks where we went 
today.

940
00:38:12,200 --> 00:38:17,200
We're having,
but I have the colonic appointment that 

941
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:17,200
day,
but it just broke and she's.

942
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:17,200
I'm like,
look,

943
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:18,480
the doctor said you're supposed to chill
out,

944
00:38:18,510 --> 00:38:19,620
relax,
take a shower.

945
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:22,320
I'm going to go run and get my kalanick 
and I'll be like,

946
00:38:22,340 --> 00:38:23,630
oh,
you got to keep it.

947
00:38:23,820 --> 00:38:27,150
This lady is so tough to get.
And I got up and I'm like,

948
00:38:27,390 --> 00:38:30,000
I know you have at least two hours.
You're so crazy.

949
00:38:30,001 --> 00:38:35,001
I ran and did the colonic.
I go now we both know we both have had 

950
00:38:35,001 --> 00:38:38,211
shit pull from.
Everything's going to be four on the 

951
00:38:38,211 --> 00:38:38,211
playing field now.

952
00:38:38,211 --> 00:38:41,040
Everything's going to be good.
I better get your shit and her baby are 

953
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:42,180
not the same right now.
La,

954
00:38:42,440 --> 00:38:43,640
la.
I had to run,

955
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:46,760
get kids getting about to be delivered.
I knew I had time.

956
00:38:46,761 --> 00:38:51,761
I knew it.
I mentally prepared for this fucking 

957
00:38:51,761 --> 00:38:54,940
trade.
Hollywood sign the weight on the weight 

958
00:38:54,940 --> 00:38:54,940
back.
I grabbed a soy latte.

959
00:38:56,040 --> 00:38:57,950
Never had coffee.
Wow.

960
00:38:58,010 --> 00:38:59,450
Yeah.
He's not a coffee drinker?

961
00:38:59,660 --> 00:39:01,220
No.
What about coffee enemas?

962
00:39:01,221 --> 00:39:02,380
What's that all about?
I Dunno.

963
00:39:02,420 --> 00:39:04,880
People stuff.
I don't understand what the.

964
00:39:04,910 --> 00:39:05,990
Whoever heard of that.
No.

965
00:39:06,080 --> 00:39:07,760
Yeah,
ground coffee somehow or another.

966
00:39:07,761 --> 00:39:10,040
They take coffee and they pump it up 
their ass hole.

967
00:39:10,490 --> 00:39:12,060
I don't know what that's about.
It's supposed to be good.

968
00:39:12,070 --> 00:39:14,930
How get it up your asshole.
I guess he used like one of those things

969
00:39:14,931 --> 00:39:17,240
that you use to put blow air on a 
fireplace.

970
00:39:18,340 --> 00:39:22,740
Scott fireplace fellows.
In the beginning I was like,

971
00:39:22,950 --> 00:39:23,460
oh,
he knows.

972
00:39:23,630 --> 00:39:24,550
Oh no,
that's not right.

973
00:39:25,060 --> 00:39:26,890
That's not right.
Either

974
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:32,000
Turkey based or you could have a big ass
Turkey based or it's stuffing up your 

975
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:33,480
ass.
Why coffee and how many different things

976
00:39:33,481 --> 00:39:35,430
in the probably look,
man,

977
00:39:35,431 --> 00:39:37,350
when you train people that invented 
Iowasca,

978
00:39:37,351 --> 00:39:38,740
they said what happens is you pour 
coffee.

979
00:39:39,480 --> 00:39:41,760
What's next?
Let's combine these two things.

980
00:39:42,060 --> 00:39:44,220
I don't know man.
I guess it would just go right into your

981
00:39:44,221 --> 00:39:46,230
bloodstream.
There's a willing online,

982
00:39:46,310 --> 00:39:48,000
um,
her youtube name,

983
00:39:48,001 --> 00:39:53,001
I think his neuro soup and she has a 
very fascinating story about taking dmt 

984
00:39:54,571 --> 00:39:55,740
upper ass.
Why?

985
00:39:56,040 --> 00:39:59,410
She put dmt upper arrest and there it 
goes right into your bloodstream because

986
00:39:59,411 --> 00:39:59,730
it's,
you know,

987
00:39:59,731 --> 00:40:02,430
it's open as opposed to,
you know,

988
00:40:02,431 --> 00:40:05,070
if you eat it and the has to go through 
your stomach and everything.

989
00:40:05,071 --> 00:40:10,071
So she,
she takes this dmt up her ass and has 

990
00:40:10,071 --> 00:40:11,520
this 30 minute trip as opposed to like a
15 minute trip.

991
00:40:11,730 --> 00:40:16,730
You know,
she probably got some fucking insane 

992
00:40:16,730 --> 00:40:16,730
dose because when you smoke it,
you know,

993
00:40:16,730 --> 00:40:16,730
you're,
you're breaking it down,

994
00:40:16,730 --> 00:40:21,600
it's kind of go into your lungs and it's
probably much less than if you actually 

995
00:40:21,600 --> 00:40:22,890
inject it right into your,
your asshole,

996
00:40:23,460 --> 00:40:25,310
your main line and into your ass 
asshole.

997
00:40:25,560 --> 00:40:29,790
People will try to get high.
I mean,

998
00:40:29,820 --> 00:40:34,820
how about those fucking assholes?
They get arrested and they have paint 

999
00:40:34,820 --> 00:40:34,820
all over their face.
Yeah,

1000
00:40:34,820 --> 00:40:36,060
because they've been puffing coughing 
bags of paint.

1001
00:40:36,810 --> 00:40:39,030
I used to have to keep it cleaner back 
in the day.

1002
00:40:40,420 --> 00:40:45,420
I like where it was like the shit that 
you sprayed on your keyboards to clean 

1003
00:40:45,420 --> 00:40:47,640
and stuff and my.
And it was like whippets.

1004
00:40:47,730 --> 00:40:51,270
It pretty much like you would do it and 
then you start hearing a warm won,

1005
00:40:51,290 --> 00:40:51,700
won,
won,

1006
00:40:51,701 --> 00:40:52,670
won,
won wild thing.

1007
00:40:52,710 --> 00:40:57,710
Oh my God.
I remember it was with my friend and he 

1008
00:40:57,710 --> 00:41:00,231
gets so pissed when I say this,
but it was with my friend and he was 

1009
00:41:00,231 --> 00:41:00,231
like,
oh,

1010
00:41:00,231 --> 00:41:00,231
I'm a bad ass.
I'm like,

1011
00:41:00,231 --> 00:41:04,820
we're driving his little.
See Crx and he fucking does it while 

1012
00:41:04,820 --> 00:41:06,260
we're driving and we're coming up with 
WHO's driving you or him?

1013
00:41:06,290 --> 00:41:06,810
No,
he is.

1014
00:41:07,960 --> 00:41:09,010
He pulls it out it out.
And I'm like,

1015
00:41:09,011 --> 00:41:10,870
what the fuck are you doing with dude,
don't worry about it.

1016
00:41:10,871 --> 00:41:15,871
I'm not doing a lot.
And he fucking passes out foot on the 

1017
00:41:15,871 --> 00:41:17,200
gas just like this.
He's like,

1018
00:41:17,290 --> 00:41:22,100
hey man,
hold his head up.

1019
00:41:23,650 --> 00:41:25,960
Fucking great quote.
Don't worry.

1020
00:41:25,961 --> 00:41:27,370
I'm not doing a lot.

1021
00:41:29,460 --> 00:41:30,270
And He,
his,

1022
00:41:30,420 --> 00:41:34,070
he passes up foot on the gas and was 
going up on a railroad track.

1023
00:41:34,071 --> 00:41:36,800
So you couldn't see if a car was coming 
on the other side of the railroad track.

1024
00:41:36,920 --> 00:41:38,120
So I was freaking out.
And,

1025
00:41:38,360 --> 00:41:43,360
and uh,
I pulled up his emergency brake and he 

1026
00:41:43,360 --> 00:41:43,590
skidded out and crashed his car.
Oh Man,

1027
00:41:43,660 --> 00:41:45,050
the first thing that comes through,
he goes,

1028
00:41:45,051 --> 00:41:46,240
what the fuck happened and gets down 
good.

1029
00:41:46,280 --> 00:41:47,540
What the fuck man?
My car.

1030
00:41:47,690 --> 00:41:52,690
I'm like,
what the fuck are you talking about 

1031
00:41:52,690 --> 00:41:52,690
doing the shit passing out with your 
foot on the gas.

1032
00:41:52,690 --> 00:41:54,170
He was mad.
He was mad at me and I was like,

1033
00:41:54,260 --> 00:41:57,680
yeah,
here's what you should do with this guy,

1034
00:41:57,860 --> 00:42:01,060
but you should have rolled out of the 
car and let destiny fucking take care of

1035
00:42:01,940 --> 00:42:03,980
Steve Austin.
The guy should've just been like,

1036
00:42:03,981 --> 00:42:05,120
whatever happens,
happens.

1037
00:42:05,630 --> 00:42:10,250
And if the car is dangerous as fuck,
that shit doesn't really work.

1038
00:42:10,250 --> 00:42:12,950
You hit your head on the concrete.
It looks awesome in the movies,

1039
00:42:12,951 --> 00:42:14,490
but the reality of rolling out of the 
car.

1040
00:42:14,540 --> 00:42:15,140
Horrible.
Yeah.

1041
00:42:15,240 --> 00:42:18,800
You're basically falling onto the 
concrete at 30 miles an hour or whatever

1042
00:42:18,801 --> 00:42:19,540
the fuck.
You're fast.

1043
00:42:19,541 --> 00:42:20,510
You're going.
How fast were you going?

1044
00:42:20,540 --> 00:42:21,380
You crashed?
Probably not.

1045
00:42:22,100 --> 00:42:26,350
We probably go in 25 when he did it and 
then we probably went up to like 45 when

1046
00:42:27,620 --> 00:42:28,670
it was like,
it was like,

1047
00:42:29,090 --> 00:42:30,950
oh my God,
it was scary as fuck.

1048
00:42:30,951 --> 00:42:32,630
Where's that dude now?
Uh,

1049
00:42:32,631 --> 00:42:36,910
well he joined the air force and then he
was one of the special six,

1050
00:42:37,220 --> 00:42:42,220
now they killed the frozen bid lodging 
and he came out of the closet and told 

1051
00:42:42,220 --> 00:42:43,490
everyone except me,
which is odd.

1052
00:42:43,820 --> 00:42:46,820
And then now he works for a company.
So he's gay.

1053
00:42:46,980 --> 00:42:48,980
Yeah.
But he hasn't told his parents or anyone

1054
00:42:48,981 --> 00:42:49,970
who's told all my friends.

1055
00:42:50,510 --> 00:42:53,570
So much drugs to mask.
Yeah,

1056
00:42:53,571 --> 00:42:55,100
I guess that's probably what it is,
right?

1057
00:42:55,340 --> 00:42:56,190
Yeah,
he's probably going to.

1058
00:42:56,191 --> 00:42:56,870
I can,
I,

1059
00:42:56,880 --> 00:42:59,240
I want to blow the bride and so bad I 
can't,

1060
00:42:59,241 --> 00:43:04,241
I can't just get high.
Just got to stay fucking something's 

1061
00:43:04,241 --> 00:43:08,540
gotta go you gotta change what's going 
on in my brain from deere was a study 

1062
00:43:08,540 --> 00:43:10,670
that somebody put up on the Rogan Board,
on the message board about the,

1063
00:43:10,750 --> 00:43:15,750
uh,
increase the number of people that are 

1064
00:43:15,750 --> 00:43:15,750
gay that have cancer as opposed to 
straight people.

1065
00:43:15,750 --> 00:43:16,760
And there's a,
there's a,

1066
00:43:16,940 --> 00:43:19,250
it's a much higher percentage of gay 
people.

1067
00:43:19,890 --> 00:43:21,350
Yeah.
And we were trying to speculate what the

1068
00:43:21,351 --> 00:43:22,730
fuck that is,
whether it's drugs,

1069
00:43:22,731 --> 00:43:24,740
because gay people party their asses 
off,

1070
00:43:25,010 --> 00:43:26,450
you know,
especially young gay dudes.

1071
00:43:26,780 --> 00:43:29,420
They party like fucking crazy every 
night of the week.

1072
00:43:29,730 --> 00:43:30,790
Yeah.
Yeah.

1073
00:43:30,850 --> 00:43:33,480
This is great.
Sunday off Santa Monica Boulevard,

1074
00:43:33,481 --> 00:43:35,330
like,
like those bars and stuff.

1075
00:43:35,360 --> 00:43:40,360
It's like Mardi gras every night I went 
to this place called the Abbey here in 

1076
00:43:40,360 --> 00:43:41,030
Los Angeles,
which is one of the bigger ones.

1077
00:43:41,031 --> 00:43:46,031
I guess.
I went with a bunch of girls and it was 

1078
00:43:46,031 --> 00:43:46,790
like two in the afternoon on a Sunday 
full party.

1079
00:43:46,791 --> 00:43:47,920
I mean,
I mean hundreds,

1080
00:43:47,930 --> 00:43:52,930
like hundreds of people drunk and like 
partying or fucking fuck.

1081
00:43:53,120 --> 00:43:58,120
No,
it looks like a fun life except for all 

1082
00:43:58,120 --> 00:43:58,730
the aids and cancer had sex,
you know,

1083
00:43:58,731 --> 00:44:00,770
it's not fun.
It's great going like,

1084
00:44:00,771 --> 00:44:03,030
like rh if here's all junk,
it's great going being like,

1085
00:44:03,031 --> 00:44:08,031
you know,
straight guy because all the chicks 

1086
00:44:08,031 --> 00:44:08,031
there are like thinking everyone's gay.
So they're like,

1087
00:44:08,031 --> 00:44:08,930
oh,
they're never going to trust you.

1088
00:44:09,200 --> 00:44:10,880
They're always going to think you're 
partially gay.

1089
00:44:11,710 --> 00:44:14,030
Like going into the going into the 
bathroom now,

1090
00:44:14,130 --> 00:44:19,130
it's like the worst experience because 
there's not only drug use like fucking 

1091
00:44:19,130 --> 00:44:20,780
everywhere and people doing cocaine on 
the sinks and everything like that,

1092
00:44:20,900 --> 00:44:25,900
but like the stall is just one of those 
big like big bathtubs and it's just like

1093
00:44:26,410 --> 00:44:31,410
you make this woodstock like fun while 
you're there because you get to hear 

1094
00:44:31,410 --> 00:44:32,810
Hendricks but filthy your a bathtub.

1095
00:44:32,870 --> 00:44:37,870
You don't.
The urinal stall or one of those 

1096
00:44:37,870 --> 00:44:40,860
fighters and what are those?
Those troughs to dose.

1097
00:44:40,870 --> 00:44:45,870
You get a lot on the road.
If you're in some weird bar in like 

1098
00:44:45,870 --> 00:44:46,240
Oklahoma,
you'll get a lot of those troughs,

1099
00:44:46,250 --> 00:44:48,000
you know where they don't have those 
fenway,

1100
00:44:48,360 --> 00:44:50,370
do they?
Those troughs makes sense.

1101
00:44:50,400 --> 00:44:55,400
It just had like dirty animals.
Let's just give them somewhat 

1102
00:44:55,400 --> 00:44:58,220
nonspecific fucking savage.
Just show me a hole to put my piss until

1103
00:44:58,370 --> 00:45:01,350
it doesn't matter what it looks like.
One of the worst times ever.

1104
00:45:01,351 --> 00:45:03,690
I used to be a manager of a coffee shop,
cod,

1105
00:45:03,691 --> 00:45:05,850
perfect cup.
Ca was perfect.

1106
00:45:05,851 --> 00:45:09,150
Cup Cappuccino is when Cappuccino just 
became big in the United States.

1107
00:45:09,151 --> 00:45:11,990
Like there was all these coffee shops 
popping up everywhere and uh,

1108
00:45:12,060 --> 00:45:17,060
right next door to it was the,
one of the grossest gay bars in 

1109
00:45:17,060 --> 00:45:17,060
Columbus,
Ohio.

1110
00:45:17,060 --> 00:45:17,160
And this is like goth gay.

1111
00:45:17,160 --> 00:45:20,490
This is like fucking the worst day ever.
And let his golf game.

1112
00:45:20,520 --> 00:45:23,250
They have that set of style.
I don't know that they hate.

1113
00:45:23,400 --> 00:45:24,880
They hate everything.
Yeah.

1114
00:45:25,850 --> 00:45:28,920
Everything awful other gay people 
themselves,

1115
00:45:28,921 --> 00:45:30,060
their parents,
everything.

1116
00:45:30,090 --> 00:45:32,250
And the woman that owned this place,
God bless her,

1117
00:45:32,251 --> 00:45:36,780
she was just like this fucking cute 
little old lady that her husband died.

1118
00:45:36,781 --> 00:45:38,400
So she died.
She was bored and sad,

1119
00:45:38,401 --> 00:45:41,010
so she took all her money to get this 
nice little coffee shop.

1120
00:45:41,310 --> 00:45:46,310
And so she's training me to be like a 
manager of this place and there's this 

1121
00:45:46,310 --> 00:45:47,220
window looking in the back yard of this 
building,

1122
00:45:47,221 --> 00:45:49,560
which is like an alley.
And she goes,

1123
00:45:49,680 --> 00:45:54,680
now I made this little curtain and she 
sewed this curtain to put it over the 

1124
00:45:54,680 --> 00:45:56,220
window.
At certain times.

1125
00:45:56,221 --> 00:45:56,910
I'm like,
she's like,

1126
00:45:56,911 --> 00:46:01,911
sometimes you're going to have to shut 
this curtain because of this place next 

1127
00:46:01,911 --> 00:46:01,911
door.

1128
00:46:01,911 --> 00:46:02,210
I'm like,
what is she talking about one time?

1129
00:46:02,270 --> 00:46:05,790
And so I used to know this job I worked 
at was fucking awful.

1130
00:46:05,791 --> 00:46:08,070
Like I would,
I would come there at like 5:00

1131
00:46:08,070 --> 00:46:13,070
AM and work till like 2:00
PM every single day and there would be 

1132
00:46:13,070 --> 00:46:16,701
guys passed out in the back of this gay 
bar that just had sex out in the back of

1133
00:46:16,951 --> 00:46:18,840
the alley and then passed out on the 
ground.

1134
00:46:19,170 --> 00:46:22,740
And so one time I just sit there and 
listen to Howard stern for hours.

1135
00:46:22,741 --> 00:46:27,741
That was my only thing to do.
No one ever came into this coffee shop 

1136
00:46:27,741 --> 00:46:29,550
and a one time like making chicken salad
or something in the back of the place.

1137
00:46:29,700 --> 00:46:33,030
I looked and there was just fucking 
three guys completely naked.

1138
00:46:33,570 --> 00:46:37,080
Fucking butt sex.
There's fucking needles everywhere.

1139
00:46:37,310 --> 00:46:41,040
Curtains just like,
I'm just fucking window up dude.

1140
00:46:41,050 --> 00:46:43,790
It was a wall of fill it up with some 
men too.

1141
00:46:43,800 --> 00:46:45,570
I wonder why no one ever is your coffee 
shop.

1142
00:46:46,230 --> 00:46:48,180
There's a fuck fuck going on,
man.

1143
00:46:49,100 --> 00:46:54,100
Exactly.
There's this full welcome sign out 

1144
00:46:54,100 --> 00:46:54,100
front.
I felt so bad.

1145
00:46:54,100 --> 00:46:54,100
She used.
I was like,

1146
00:46:54,100 --> 00:46:55,650
she wanted a logo and she was going to 
pay me.

1147
00:46:55,651 --> 00:46:56,010
I was like,
you know,

1148
00:46:56,070 --> 00:46:57,880
I'll just make the logo for you,
you know?

1149
00:46:58,350 --> 00:47:01,470
I just felt so bad for this.
I only lasted like a month there,

1150
00:47:01,471 --> 00:47:04,530
but I just became so depressed.
And then like those guys,

1151
00:47:04,660 --> 00:47:09,660
you just depressed.
It sounds like they were having a good 

1152
00:47:09,660 --> 00:47:11,301
time now because it was so awful.
It was just like those people then come 

1153
00:47:11,301 --> 00:47:12,080
after having sex every morning.
These,

1154
00:47:12,170 --> 00:47:13,200
these,
these homeless.

1155
00:47:13,201 --> 00:47:16,110
But sex guys,
they'd come in and get coffees every day

1156
00:47:16,170 --> 00:47:17,670
and they're just like hanging out smell 
like.

1157
00:47:17,671 --> 00:47:22,410
But sex and fucking Ari and then like 
old books,

1158
00:47:22,860 --> 00:47:25,620
old books.
And it was just the grossest,

1159
00:47:25,621 --> 00:47:28,320
like it looked like a country kitchen 
with but sex,

1160
00:47:28,440 --> 00:47:30,040
homeless people.
So you're now gay

1161
00:47:30,040 --> 00:47:32,020
dudes will totally take over a 
neighborhood.

1162
00:47:32,200 --> 00:47:33,310
They tell everybody,
hey man,

1163
00:47:33,311 --> 00:47:34,570
I'm moving here.
Why don't you move here too?

1164
00:47:34,590 --> 00:47:38,000
I'll just fuck all day.
They get like a whole group of them.

1165
00:47:38,180 --> 00:47:41,120
Lesbians have never figured out how to 
rock that now.

1166
00:47:41,200 --> 00:47:43,840
They can't really organize the way gay 
dudes can.

1167
00:47:44,080 --> 00:47:46,540
Gay dudes can take over whole 
neighborhoods.

1168
00:47:46,590 --> 00:47:51,590
You know,
like we're going to San Francisco this 

1169
00:47:51,590 --> 00:47:51,590
weekend,
by the way.

1170
00:47:51,590 --> 00:47:51,640
COBB's comedy club one.
What made you think of San Francisco?

1171
00:47:51,641 --> 00:47:56,641
I'm all sold out patches because there's
a lot of buts sex going on in San 

1172
00:47:56,641 --> 00:47:56,641
Francisco.
His son,

1173
00:47:56,641 --> 00:47:58,750
um,
cobb's comedy club this Thursday,

1174
00:47:58,751 --> 00:48:01,690
Friday and Saturday with Sam Tripoli.
Oh Shit.

1175
00:48:01,870 --> 00:48:04,150
And Tom Cigar.
It's a fucking double whammy,

1176
00:48:04,160 --> 00:48:05,010
folks.
Good.

1177
00:48:05,200 --> 00:48:08,730
That's two headliners open up for me to 
do there.

1178
00:48:08,780 --> 00:48:10,660
Those guys are killers.
We're going to have a good fucking time.

1179
00:48:10,960 --> 00:48:15,960
But you know,
there's areas of San Francisco that are 

1180
00:48:15,960 --> 00:48:16,240
like,
shit actually gay just like,

1181
00:48:16,330 --> 00:48:21,330
I think Santa Monica Boulevard,
they'll tops it as far as like 

1182
00:48:21,330 --> 00:48:21,340
exclusively gang gays place in the 
planet.

1183
00:48:21,370 --> 00:48:22,990
It's one of,
it's like the epicenter of,

1184
00:48:23,040 --> 00:48:24,280
of Homo.
It's better.

1185
00:48:24,281 --> 00:48:28,060
It's bigger than even like Chelsea,
Chelsea down in New York.

1186
00:48:28,061 --> 00:48:29,320
It is close,
but yeah,

1187
00:48:29,590 --> 00:48:34,590
there's just so many people in New York,
but West Hollywood,

1188
00:48:34,751 --> 00:48:38,350
it's just like there's no like rolling 
into West Hollywood and be like,

1189
00:48:38,351 --> 00:48:40,280
what are you fucking guys doing here?
That's like,

1190
00:48:40,360 --> 00:48:42,130
no,
what the fuck are you doing here?

1191
00:48:42,150 --> 00:48:43,150
Well,
exactly.

1192
00:48:43,240 --> 00:48:47,350
There's the gay flag is our flag of 
Santa Monica Boulevard.

1193
00:48:47,351 --> 00:48:50,560
It's like this is our place.
When you drive by rage,

1194
00:48:50,561 --> 00:48:52,690
have you ever driven by raging like 
Friday and Saturday night?

1195
00:48:52,900 --> 00:48:55,290
Like carnival outside?
They had just fuck.

1196
00:48:55,860 --> 00:48:58,210
It certainly seems like they're having 
more fun.

1197
00:48:58,630 --> 00:49:03,630
I picked up one of those newspapers that
had all the hookers and escorts and 

1198
00:49:03,630 --> 00:49:06,661
stuff like that and have like whole 
pages with trannies and one of the 

1199
00:49:06,661 --> 00:49:08,980
things that says onto is 100 percent 
working fully functional trannies.

1200
00:49:09,100 --> 00:49:11,950
Does that mean like they,
they got the vagina and the vagina works

1201
00:49:11,951 --> 00:49:14,820
so you can fuck it.
So thanks Dick.

1202
00:49:15,480 --> 00:49:16,960
Oh,
so that's what fully function.

1203
00:49:16,961 --> 00:49:19,300
If I had to guess,
I would say that their dick still works,

1204
00:49:19,301 --> 00:49:21,580
but their trends there,
they're transvestite,

1205
00:49:21,910 --> 00:49:24,060
transsexual.
Say trannies.

1206
00:49:24,290 --> 00:49:28,060
Like I think trans sexual is like they 
want to be a woman,

1207
00:49:28,390 --> 00:49:33,390
but a transvestite.
They want to be a man dressed as a 

1208
00:49:33,390 --> 00:49:33,390
woman.
As a woman.

1209
00:49:33,390 --> 00:49:37,021
Yeah.
Transsexuals are probably the people 

1210
00:49:37,021 --> 00:49:37,330
that are starting the process of 
becoming the best possible too,

1211
00:49:37,331 --> 00:49:40,590
but there's some of them are just dudes 
that just for whatever weird reason like

1212
00:49:40,600 --> 00:49:45,600
to dress up like girls,
like Chaz Bono is what a transsexual,

1213
00:49:46,690 --> 00:49:51,690
I don't know,
but I almost had to watch that take 

1214
00:49:51,690 --> 00:49:56,380
Rogan somewhere and I was in a waiting 
room for an hour and I was watching good

1215
00:49:56,531 --> 00:49:59,830
morning America and then they were 
talking about Oprah being on next,

1216
00:50:00,130 --> 00:50:01,960
you know,
and not an accident was like at 3:00

1217
00:50:01,960 --> 00:50:03,250
PM and I was like,
God damn it.

1218
00:50:03,250 --> 00:50:04,540
I might have to watch this.
This.

1219
00:50:04,541 --> 00:50:07,150
They keep teasing me with this Chaz Bono
and Bono thing.

1220
00:50:07,360 --> 00:50:09,610
I want to see the story.
I want to know the real truth.

1221
00:50:10,120 --> 00:50:12,410
You won't get it from Oprah.
I want to get it from what?

1222
00:50:12,430 --> 00:50:13,960
Listening to her talk.
If I get it,

1223
00:50:13,990 --> 00:50:16,620
I might get it from listening or just 
hearing the answers of the questions.

1224
00:50:16,621 --> 00:50:19,600
It's got to be that she was ignored.
That's the only thing that makes sense I

1225
00:50:19,601 --> 00:50:20,800
guess to see your website.
All right,

1226
00:50:20,801 --> 00:50:21,280
let's go.
I'm like,

1227
00:50:21,281 --> 00:50:22,810
no,
I got to watch the rest of this.

1228
00:50:22,811 --> 00:50:24,970
Oprah.
I understand.

1229
00:50:24,971 --> 00:50:29,971
I haven't taped at home.
I understand lesbians because I think 

1230
00:50:29,971 --> 00:50:29,971
women are hot.

1231
00:50:29,971 --> 00:50:30,010
I get it.
I get it.

1232
00:50:30,060 --> 00:50:33,220
It makes sense to me and her girlfriend.
His.

1233
00:50:33,290 --> 00:50:34,900
I don't know.
Can Chad's.

1234
00:50:34,901 --> 00:50:37,770
His girlfriend is cute.
She's a cute girl.

1235
00:50:37,780 --> 00:50:39,420
Really?
Name.

1236
00:50:39,680 --> 00:50:44,680
She's got a name Bro.
She's got some fucking pull it flushed 

1237
00:50:44,680 --> 00:50:47,490
work in the lesbian community as well.
Very popular now.

1238
00:50:47,520 --> 00:50:50,180
Mom went and what?
You are his chair.

1239
00:50:50,181 --> 00:50:51,080
That's still pretty good.

1240
00:50:51,490 --> 00:50:53,050
Yeah.
Share and Sonny Bono?

1241
00:50:53,080 --> 00:50:54,880
Yeah.
Not Bad.

1242
00:50:55,150 --> 00:50:56,320
Not Bad.
It's a story.

1243
00:50:56,380 --> 00:50:59,020
It's worth saying.
Who are you dating this?

1244
00:50:59,220 --> 00:51:00,430
This this year.
Oh,

1245
00:51:01,300 --> 00:51:02,020
Chaz.
Chaz.

1246
00:51:02,021 --> 00:51:02,650
Bono,
Huh?

1247
00:51:02,680 --> 00:51:03,640
Yeah.
That's interesting.

1248
00:51:03,730 --> 00:51:04,960
Okay.
But the weird.

1249
00:51:04,980 --> 00:51:07,270
But what I was gonna say is I think 
become.

1250
00:51:07,390 --> 00:51:12,390
I understand wanting to be gay.
I don't understand why it would be the 

1251
00:51:12,390 --> 00:51:12,390
other sex,
but you know,

1252
00:51:12,390 --> 00:51:12,800
maybe it's just my own mind,
you know?

1253
00:51:12,940 --> 00:51:15,340
I mean maybe a try it.
Yeah,

1254
00:51:15,400 --> 00:51:20,400
exactly.
Maybe some dudes are just wired a 

1255
00:51:20,400 --> 00:51:22,381
certain way.
I have a friend whose son is becoming 

1256
00:51:22,381 --> 00:51:22,381
girl.
Oh really?

1257
00:51:22,381 --> 00:51:25,560
Yeah.
His son is like just turning 18 and 

1258
00:51:25,560 --> 00:51:25,560
wants to be a girl,
so she's going,

1259
00:51:25,560 --> 00:51:26,680
he's going through all the different 
steps,

1260
00:51:26,681 --> 00:51:30,670
but you know,
this poor fuck is in a bad situation.

1261
00:51:30,671 --> 00:51:33,190
He's in the middle of a crazy divorce 
and all kinds of shit.

1262
00:51:33,191 --> 00:51:35,710
But,
but just the idea of your son wanting to

1263
00:51:35,711 --> 00:51:36,760
be a girl,
like you know,

1264
00:51:36,880 --> 00:51:39,010
like fuck with this holtzman say about 
it.

1265
00:51:39,040 --> 00:51:42,460
Hey,
easy easy son.

1266
00:51:42,760 --> 00:51:44,230
That's actually.
He's joking around.

1267
00:51:44,231 --> 00:51:46,660
That's a Holtzman joke.
One of his best.

1268
00:51:47,180 --> 00:51:49,510
I used to call that out from the back of
the room all the time.

1269
00:51:49,540 --> 00:51:50,770
Miss that.
I miss that guy.

1270
00:51:51,190 --> 00:51:52,810
I miss those days of the comedy store,
man.

1271
00:51:53,150 --> 00:51:55,460
A good fucking times in that club.
Oh,

1272
00:51:55,480 --> 00:51:58,090
you had a lot of bad energy,
but a lot of good times.

1273
00:51:59,110 --> 00:52:00,430
You know,
I heard this hilarious.

1274
00:52:00,470 --> 00:52:05,470
What two different people have told me 
the story that Tommy said that he used 

1275
00:52:05,470 --> 00:52:06,910
to be an actor and he wanted to be an 
actor,

1276
00:52:06,911 --> 00:52:08,440
but too many homos were hitting on him.

1277
00:52:08,460 --> 00:52:10,080
Of course,
used to run,

1278
00:52:10,360 --> 00:52:13,020
used to run a all male review.
Dan show data,

1279
00:52:13,021 --> 00:52:14,940
not Tampa.
I think it was Jacksonville,

1280
00:52:14,941 --> 00:52:15,810
Florida.
Really?

1281
00:52:15,900 --> 00:52:16,880
And yeah,
he had like a,

1282
00:52:16,910 --> 00:52:21,300
he truly wanted to become an actor.
He was an all male review guy.

1283
00:52:21,301 --> 00:52:26,301
What does that mean?
He would host the all male review dance 

1284
00:52:26,301 --> 00:52:27,180
show.
So it was like a gay strip show anyway.

1285
00:52:27,700 --> 00:52:32,700
Yeah.
But he never liked when the guys came 

1286
00:52:32,700 --> 00:52:33,300
onto him.
So that's why you stayed out of acting.

1287
00:52:33,301 --> 00:52:34,380
So that's why.
Yeah,

1288
00:52:34,381 --> 00:52:39,381
it was just,
it was him and Johnny Depp I think are 

1289
00:52:39,381 --> 00:52:42,111
the two most irresistible.
Don't you think Johnny Depp would have 

1290
00:52:42,111 --> 00:52:42,660
been like the guy that's like,
look,

1291
00:52:42,661 --> 00:52:45,390
I'm not getting into acting because I 
get hit on all the time.

1292
00:52:45,420 --> 00:52:48,630
Like if Johnny Depp's cool with it,
I think Tommy Morris should know.

1293
00:52:48,740 --> 00:52:50,990
You know Johnny Depp.
I have a,

1294
00:52:50,991 --> 00:52:53,310
a special affection for that guy.

1295
00:52:53,520 --> 00:52:55,570
He's just like him.
I like him too.

1296
00:52:55,620 --> 00:52:57,690
I saw the uh,
he's legit.

1297
00:52:58,110 --> 00:53:00,300
The pirates of the Caribbean Guy,
first of all,

1298
00:53:00,301 --> 00:53:02,520
he looks like he's 18 years old.
He looks at me.

1299
00:53:02,530 --> 00:53:05,310
It's still do 21 jump street like 50.
He is.

1300
00:53:05,880 --> 00:53:07,950
I've never seen anything like it.
Smoke cigarettes,

1301
00:53:07,951 --> 00:53:08,610
does he?
Yeah,

1302
00:53:08,730 --> 00:53:10,980
I think it's just crazy.
[inaudible] France.

1303
00:53:11,010 --> 00:53:12,810
He lives in France.
Is that what it is?

1304
00:53:12,900 --> 00:53:14,740
He lives in France.
He comes on his face.

1305
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:20,000
He lives on his friend.
He lives in France and his wife French 

1306
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:20,000
or something like that.
Yeah,

1307
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:20,000
that's why I'm a big

1308
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:24,750
fan of him.
Ever since I found out he was a big fan 

1309
00:53:24,750 --> 00:53:24,750
of hunter s Thompson and then when he 
did fear and loathing in las was great.

1310
00:53:24,750 --> 00:53:25,620
Who was good?
Who's very good.

1311
00:53:25,650 --> 00:53:30,650
Bill Murray was actually better.
Bill Murray did where the Buffalo 

1312
00:53:30,650 --> 00:53:33,381
Rome's.
He played hunter s thompson and that 

1313
00:53:33,381 --> 00:53:33,381
fucking genius.
He nailed it,

1314
00:53:33,381 --> 00:53:36,950
but the movie was not as good.
Fear and loathing was a much better 

1315
00:53:36,950 --> 00:53:36,950
movie overall.
Yeah,

1316
00:53:36,950 --> 00:53:39,960
but I don't think Johnny Depp is voice 
where like there's certain impressions I

1317
00:53:39,961 --> 00:53:41,010
can't.
Do you know,

1318
00:53:41,020 --> 00:53:41,760
I,
I can't.

1319
00:53:41,761 --> 00:53:46,761
I try and my voice doesn't work that way
and some people just can't do like 

1320
00:53:46,761 --> 00:53:50,920
Johnny Depp sounds like he's trying to 
sound like a version of hunter s 

1321
00:53:50,920 --> 00:53:55,041
Thompson,
but bill murray sounds like hunter s 

1322
00:53:55,041 --> 00:53:57,381
Thompson.
But then when I found out that Johnny 

1323
00:53:57,381 --> 00:53:59,300
Depp lived in hunters basement and 
fucking stayed with them for fucking 

1324
00:53:59,300 --> 00:53:59,820
like weeks and weeks trying to work on 
the whole impression of,

1325
00:53:59,821 --> 00:54:00,270
Oh,
Mica,

1326
00:54:00,440 --> 00:54:01,390
so you listen to this.

1327
00:54:01,520 --> 00:54:04,130
I was on a plane today back from New 
York and uh,

1328
00:54:04,310 --> 00:54:07,860
sally field was sitting next to me,
so she was very nice and she was reading

1329
00:54:07,861 --> 00:54:11,300
a book and then one point she stops and 
something happened.

1330
00:54:11,301 --> 00:54:13,040
We got into a conversation.
She's playing,

1331
00:54:13,041 --> 00:54:18,041
she's in this new movie where she's 
playing Abraham Lincoln's wife and 

1332
00:54:18,041 --> 00:54:18,850
Steven Spielberg's directing and,
and,

1333
00:54:18,950 --> 00:54:21,110
and Daniel Day Lewis is playing Abraham 
Lincoln.

1334
00:54:21,230 --> 00:54:22,550
Oh Shit.
I gotta ask you.

1335
00:54:22,551 --> 00:54:27,551
I said,
I just let me know if you can't answer 

1336
00:54:27,551 --> 00:54:27,551
it.
I go,

1337
00:54:27,551 --> 00:54:27,690
has he started the process yet?
And she goes up.

1338
00:54:28,550 --> 00:54:33,550
And the way she said it,
it was like somewhere in the world as a 

1339
00:54:33,550 --> 00:54:36,341
man walking around right now.
Thinking that he is Abraham Lincoln 

1340
00:54:37,130 --> 00:54:42,130
gangster and crazy Daniel Day Lewis gets
into that shit where it's like months 

1341
00:54:42,130 --> 00:54:46,760
and months and months in advance.
He is preparing so that when he's there,

1342
00:54:46,761 --> 00:54:47,630
it's just,
that's what,

1343
00:54:47,631 --> 00:54:48,350
that's all he is.

1344
00:54:48,410 --> 00:54:50,210
You know when he filmed there will be 
blood.

1345
00:54:50,240 --> 00:54:52,760
He slept in a tent set.
Yeah.

1346
00:54:53,450 --> 00:54:56,000
Yeah.
Remember he got all greasy and shit.

1347
00:54:56,240 --> 00:54:58,160
That's how he got into it.
That's how he got into his role.

1348
00:54:58,161 --> 00:55:00,710
He just became that guy.
Just crazy.

1349
00:55:00,770 --> 00:55:02,360
He's,
he's my opinion.

1350
00:55:02,361 --> 00:55:02,420
Yeah.

1351
00:55:02,480 --> 00:55:07,480
Best.
He's the best and there's a reason why 

1352
00:55:07,480 --> 00:55:09,361
you only doesn't move like once every 
three years because it takes that 

1353
00:55:09,361 --> 00:55:09,361
fucking,
you know,

1354
00:55:09,361 --> 00:55:09,460
in his mind.
I don't know if it always will,

1355
00:55:09,461 --> 00:55:12,160
but that right now it takes that to get 
to there and it's like,

1356
00:55:12,161 --> 00:55:13,400
fuck it.
Just do what you want to do.

1357
00:55:13,430 --> 00:55:15,080
Do you ever see that movie where he 
played a boxer?

1358
00:55:15,590 --> 00:55:16,970
The best boxing?
It's called.

1359
00:55:17,720 --> 00:55:20,960
I think it was the best boxing fight 
scenes in any movie ever.

1360
00:55:20,990 --> 00:55:25,990
The most believable.
And I heard that Mark Walberg like new 

1361
00:55:25,990 --> 00:55:25,990
had a box.
I've heard that.

1362
00:55:25,990 --> 00:55:26,140
What did you think of that?
I was at,

1363
00:55:26,200 --> 00:55:28,340
I was going to ask you,
it was a good movie,

1364
00:55:28,460 --> 00:55:33,460
but I felt like it was a little flat and
it felt like the fight seems look fake 

1365
00:55:33,460 --> 00:55:34,700
as fuck.
It's like I'm doing this movie right now

1366
00:55:34,701 --> 00:55:35,750
called,
here comes the boom.

1367
00:55:35,810 --> 00:55:37,900
It's a Kevin James is mixed martial arts
movie.

1368
00:55:37,901 --> 00:55:42,901
Oh cool.
It's a comedy and it's also makes the 

1369
00:55:42,901 --> 00:55:44,980
fucking fight scenes are off the chain.
Really Got Ryan Parsons is helping them 

1370
00:55:44,991 --> 00:55:46,790
out there and this dude daryl,
who's the,

1371
00:55:46,980 --> 00:55:51,980
the fight coordinator and boss Rutan's 
helping them to and they came up with 

1372
00:55:51,980 --> 00:55:56,711
this,
these amazing fight and fucking these 

1373
00:55:56,711 --> 00:55:59,471
sequences are.
They look so realistic and so good and 

1374
00:55:59,471 --> 00:56:00,740
so well shot and so dynamic and it keeps
your interest.

1375
00:56:00,860 --> 00:56:03,450
Like I watched one of the mayhem,
uh,

1376
00:56:03,590 --> 00:56:08,590
Jason May Hand Miller and Kevin James 
Fight and I watched the fight and I'm 

1377
00:56:08,590 --> 00:56:09,890
like,
this is fucking well done.

1378
00:56:09,920 --> 00:56:12,150
Real.
Like it's totally realistic,

1379
00:56:12,151 --> 00:56:15,350
like the scenarios realistic,
but it's also like the way they shot it,

1380
00:56:15,360 --> 00:56:17,480
super dynamic.
They're always moving.

1381
00:56:17,600 --> 00:56:19,000
Whereas I looked at the fighter and I'm 
like,

1382
00:56:19,010 --> 00:56:24,010
this seems flat.
It's like this is like we're watching 

1383
00:56:24,010 --> 00:56:24,010
rocky too,
man.

1384
00:56:24,010 --> 00:56:24,010
I've this before.
Yeah.

1385
00:56:24,100 --> 00:56:29,100
I've seen these exact same scenes of 
this guy punching the other guy and I 

1386
00:56:29,100 --> 00:56:32,731
think.
I think those kinds of directors choose 

1387
00:56:32,731 --> 00:56:32,731
to do it,
like what they would consider artfully,

1388
00:56:32,731 --> 00:56:36,190
where they're just gonna keep the camera
on it and let the action you need to see

1389
00:56:36,191 --> 00:56:39,160
different angles you want.
That's why watching fights,

1390
00:56:39,161 --> 00:56:40,360
you know,
live is amazing,

1391
00:56:40,361 --> 00:56:41,790
but like I'll even on television just 
seek.

1392
00:56:41,830 --> 00:56:44,380
You cut the different angles when it.
When a guy's in this position,

1393
00:56:44,381 --> 00:56:49,381
they can go around the other side and 
it's cool to see those different things 

1394
00:56:49,381 --> 00:56:50,630
like those already artsy movies are 
like,

1395
00:56:50,680 --> 00:56:55,680
well,
just get to keep the camera there and 

1396
00:56:55,680 --> 00:56:57,031
let the respectfully.
I'm mark Walberg did not imitate Micky 

1397
00:56:58,020 --> 00:56:59,470
Ward style.
He just didn't.

1398
00:56:59,670 --> 00:57:02,440
He through a decent left hook to the 
body like that looked okay,

1399
00:57:02,740 --> 00:57:06,100
but micky ward had a very particular way
of holding his hands.

1400
00:57:06,190 --> 00:57:08,920
He had a very particular style of 
throwing his,

1401
00:57:09,040 --> 00:57:11,230
his faints,
and it has movement.

1402
00:57:11,410 --> 00:57:13,300
It was very easy to watch,
you know,

1403
00:57:13,301 --> 00:57:16,420
like Anderson Silva is awesome and 
imitating fighters,

1404
00:57:17,010 --> 00:57:17,470
uh,
key.

1405
00:57:17,471 --> 00:57:22,471
Uh,
there's all these videos online of him 

1406
00:57:22,471 --> 00:57:23,770
imitating Leo Machida and Imitating 
Chuck Liddell and there's star fighters 

1407
00:57:23,770 --> 00:57:28,021
of styles.
They have a certain way they move and 

1408
00:57:28,021 --> 00:57:30,211
you can't just be you in a Boston accent
and you call your name Mickey,

1409
00:57:31,420 --> 00:57:31,990
you know.
No,

1410
00:57:31,991 --> 00:57:34,030
you have to move,
like micky ward moved.

1411
00:57:34,090 --> 00:57:39,090
You have to box way micky ward box,
which is why I thought you can't have 

1412
00:57:39,090 --> 00:57:39,520
your chin up in the air and throwing 
punches.

1413
00:57:39,521 --> 00:57:44,521
Like a guy who's never been punched in 
the face because that's what I'm 

1414
00:57:44,521 --> 00:57:44,521
watching.
I'm watching.

1415
00:57:44,521 --> 00:57:47,880
I'm watching guys real punches in a 
boxing match is not like the way a guy 

1416
00:57:47,880 --> 00:57:48,250
throws punches in a boxing match.
It May.

1417
00:57:48,250 --> 00:57:49,210
Maybe to me,
I'm a,

1418
00:57:49,220 --> 00:57:54,220
I'm an extremist because my job,
one of my jobs is to watch fighting and 

1419
00:57:54,220 --> 00:57:55,450
analyze it and break it down.

1420
00:57:55,780 --> 00:57:56,710
But I'm watching this.
I'm like,

1421
00:57:56,711 --> 00:57:58,470
you didn't even try man.
You didn't even try.

1422
00:57:58,490 --> 00:58:00,580
If I was your friend,
if I was mark Wahlberg's friend,

1423
00:58:00,790 --> 00:58:01,600
I'd be like,
Yo dude,

1424
00:58:01,601 --> 00:58:05,380
this is a fucking micky ward is one of 
those guys,

1425
00:58:05,381 --> 00:58:08,410
especially in Boston,
that that's where he's from.

1426
00:58:08,411 --> 00:58:10,640
That's where walbergs from to this guy 
cares.

1427
00:58:10,660 --> 00:58:12,360
There's a,
there's a legend to that guy.

1428
00:58:12,380 --> 00:58:16,030
He's easy.
He's an all time great Boston character.

1429
00:58:16,500 --> 00:58:19,840
His fights had the display of courage 
and will.

1430
00:58:19,841 --> 00:58:23,140
Those are all times spectacular moments 
in boxing.

1431
00:58:23,350 --> 00:58:24,910
You owe a lot more than that,
man.

1432
00:58:24,911 --> 00:58:28,540
You gotta you gotTa work on that style 
and I also hope they don't do well.

1433
00:58:28,541 --> 00:58:29,680
First of all,
I thought that,

1434
00:58:29,790 --> 00:58:34,790
uh,
what's his name as the brother was 

1435
00:58:34,790 --> 00:58:34,790
fucking brilliant.
Brilliant.

1436
00:58:34,790 --> 00:58:34,790
Excellent.
Yeah,

1437
00:58:34,790 --> 00:58:35,440
because he,
he,

1438
00:58:35,540 --> 00:58:38,890
he knew the boxing and even if you could
tell that he probably didn't come from a

1439
00:58:38,891 --> 00:58:39,910
boxing background.

1440
00:58:39,910 --> 00:58:42,260
So whatever he started with was from 
fresh.

1441
00:58:42,261 --> 00:58:44,410
And to the point that he got,
I thought it was really good.

1442
00:58:44,470 --> 00:58:47,320
It was decent.
So he also embodied the guy.

1443
00:58:47,380 --> 00:58:48,130
Yeah.
Very,

1444
00:58:48,131 --> 00:58:49,030
very well.
Very well.

1445
00:58:49,090 --> 00:58:50,150
Yeah.
I hope they don't do that.

1446
00:58:50,200 --> 00:58:53,260
I hope that this is talking about them 
doing fighter to where he will.

1447
00:58:53,261 --> 00:58:56,330
They'll get like Arturo Gotti out there.
We're trying to find,

1448
00:58:56,550 --> 00:59:01,550
you know,
it's like really is there to talk about 

1449
00:59:01,550 --> 00:59:01,550
that.
I've heard I,

1450
00:59:01,550 --> 00:59:04,171
I don't know.
I've heard just through different 

1451
00:59:04,171 --> 00:59:04,171
channels.
I hope be.

1452
00:59:04,171 --> 00:59:06,040
That would be stupid to say that,
but what if they did a good job of it?

1453
00:59:06,041 --> 00:59:07,030
Who the fuck knows,
you know,

1454
00:59:07,031 --> 00:59:12,031
the idea that never would have thought 
this one and this was a good movie and 

1455
00:59:12,031 --> 00:59:12,880
Walberg is a good actor when he's 
acting.

1456
00:59:13,180 --> 00:59:15,130
But I just felt like in his fight 
scenes,

1457
00:59:15,131 --> 00:59:17,800
I just feel like it wasn't enough like 
micky ward and it wasn't an.

1458
00:59:17,830 --> 00:59:19,240
It wasn't realistic enough,
man.

1459
00:59:19,510 --> 00:59:24,510
You know,
you guys get you to hit each other a 

1460
00:59:24,510 --> 00:59:24,510
little.
You know,

1461
00:59:24,510 --> 00:59:24,510
I want to see you really get hit,
man.

1462
00:59:24,510 --> 00:59:26,840
I want to see a little.
I want to see a slap on to see a fucking

1463
00:59:26,841 --> 00:59:28,010
Jap.
Knock your hair back,

1464
00:59:28,011 --> 00:59:29,330
man.
I want to see it real.

1465
00:59:29,331 --> 00:59:30,080
I'm.
This isn't real.

1466
00:59:30,081 --> 00:59:31,160
To me,
this is like,

1467
00:59:31,310 --> 00:59:32,780
oh,
here's the fight scene in the movie,

1468
00:59:32,781 --> 00:59:37,781
my heart and didn't move at all when I 
watched that Kevin Jameson and Kevin 

1469
00:59:37,781 --> 00:59:40,370
James and mayhem,
just the pure artistic version.

1470
00:59:40,520 --> 00:59:41,810
Like the,
what they did,

1471
00:59:41,811 --> 00:59:42,060
the,
the,

1472
00:59:42,140 --> 00:59:44,240
their version of the fight scene.
I was like,

1473
00:59:44,241 --> 00:59:46,570
these motherfuckers thought this shit 
out there.

1474
00:59:46,571 --> 00:59:51,571
There's a,
there's a camera on his chest while 

1475
00:59:51,571 --> 00:59:53,531
they're grappling.
It was like there's wild shot of him 

1476
00:59:53,531 --> 00:59:54,080
getting belly to belly suplex from a 
camera on his chest.

1477
00:59:54,081 --> 00:59:55,610
Like to it.
It's good.

1478
00:59:55,640 --> 00:59:56,870
It's like,
it's interesting.

1479
00:59:56,871 --> 00:59:59,630
It cuts from a bunch of different angles
and you know,

1480
00:59:59,631 --> 01:00:04,631
and,
and it looks like they're really 

1481
01:00:04,631 --> 01:00:04,631
fighting.

1482
01:00:04,631 --> 01:00:04,631
What kind of shape is he in?
Right?

1483
01:00:04,631 --> 01:00:07,310
You gotta realize 80 pounds.
But yeah,

1484
01:00:07,400 --> 01:00:08,270
Kevin,
whoops.

1485
01:00:08,360 --> 01:00:11,120
Kevin James went on this all Vegan all 
live.

1486
01:00:11,121 --> 01:00:12,590
It's all raw foods.
Diet.

1487
01:00:12,591 --> 01:00:14,750
And he went out a while ago.
This was a woman who,

1488
01:00:14,751 --> 01:00:17,120
uh,
wrote this book that Mrs Rogan's reading

1489
01:00:17,121 --> 01:00:22,121
right now and it's a,
she's doing it too and some all raw 

1490
01:00:22,121 --> 01:00:24,540
foods all like Kale blended up and all 
this different shit will.

1491
01:00:24,560 --> 01:00:26,660
Kevin was on that movie,
the um,

1492
01:00:26,990 --> 01:00:29,240
what's it called?
The dilemma with Vince Vaughn.

1493
01:00:29,860 --> 01:00:32,300
Vince and him became pals and vince was 
like,

1494
01:00:32,301 --> 01:00:32,900
Bro,
you know,

1495
01:00:33,130 --> 01:00:34,400
you're fucking really heavy.
You know,

1496
01:00:34,401 --> 01:00:36,170
you've got to do something to Kevin.
I know Kevin,

1497
01:00:36,200 --> 01:00:41,200
I've been friends with Kevin for 20 
years and he's been struggling with his 

1498
01:00:41,200 --> 01:00:43,841
weight for 20 years.
We did a ball cop together and we would 

1499
01:00:43,841 --> 01:00:45,380
drive home together in Boston and he 
would have to eat all day.

1500
01:00:45,380 --> 01:00:50,380
He had his own chef and stuff and eat 
well all day and then we would hit 

1501
01:00:50,380 --> 01:00:50,380
Mcdonald's and Burger King,
whatever.

1502
01:00:50,450 --> 01:00:53,870
It would be like 30 bucks the bill.
I'm not kidding you man.

1503
01:00:54,320 --> 01:00:56,430
He was like Joe Rogan.
He would kill it.

1504
01:00:56,470 --> 01:00:57,850
I could fuck up some food.
So on.

1505
01:00:57,851 --> 01:00:59,440
And he was so cool about.
He'd be like,

1506
01:00:59,450 --> 01:01:00,350
add,
this is fucking good.

1507
01:01:00,380 --> 01:01:01,480
You'd just be eating,
you know,

1508
01:01:01,610 --> 01:01:03,650
like he doesn't have shaman.
And Kevin did very,

1509
01:01:03,651 --> 01:01:06,140
very honest dude,
but he also realized like,

1510
01:01:06,141 --> 01:01:07,280
God,
I gotta do something about this.

1511
01:01:07,281 --> 01:01:10,160
So it's been nine months.
He's had no meat for nine months.

1512
01:01:10,161 --> 01:01:13,940
Everything has been all raw vegan,
everything super,

1513
01:01:13,941 --> 01:01:16,520
super healthy,
but he's ready to go off like a rocket.

1514
01:01:16,521 --> 01:01:18,740
As soon as this filming is over,
he's going to eat a whole cow.

1515
01:01:18,760 --> 01:01:19,230
Really?
Yeah.

1516
01:01:19,350 --> 01:01:20,770
He's going to take it.
He was just going.

1517
01:01:20,790 --> 01:01:22,070
It's rate to Ruth's Chris.

1518
01:01:22,220 --> 01:01:27,220
That's a wrap.
She's going to be a car that's going to 

1519
01:01:27,220 --> 01:01:27,220
drive them straight to Ruth's Chris 
Steakhouse.

1520
01:01:27,220 --> 01:01:29,630
He's going to get it fucking t bone and 
mashed potatoes with gravy,

1521
01:01:30,390 --> 01:01:35,390
but he's.
He's lost a tremendous amount of weigh 

1522
01:01:35,390 --> 01:01:37,190
80 pounds.
Kevin has always had like real martial 

1523
01:01:37,190 --> 01:01:39,881
arts skill and even try to get them to 
do the podcast because I'm doing the 

1524
01:01:39,881 --> 01:01:42,731
movie.
I'm going to be with him for nine days 

1525
01:01:42,731 --> 01:01:46,120
and I'm a.
I'm going to try to get them to do the 

1526
01:01:46,120 --> 01:01:46,550
podcast,
but he's like super private man.

1527
01:01:46,551 --> 01:01:48,750
He doesn't like to talk about shit 
publicly.

1528
01:01:48,780 --> 01:01:52,970
Doesn't like to do exposing interviews 
like the opposite of me or I'll tell you

1529
01:01:52,971 --> 01:01:54,410
exactly what I'm thinking about 
everything.

1530
01:01:54,590 --> 01:01:56,210
He's not that kind of a guy.
He's.

1531
01:01:56,300 --> 01:02:01,300
He's.
He's a little bit more laid back and 

1532
01:02:01,300 --> 01:02:01,300
it's hard to get them to to.
I don't know if he's going to willing to

1533
01:02:01,300 --> 01:02:03,530
do an interview like that,
but the story is very interesting.

1534
01:02:03,740 --> 01:02:07,670
He's lost 80 fucking pounds.
He looks fantastic or faces all thin.

1535
01:02:07,680 --> 01:02:09,740
His body,
he's still like a little fat.

1536
01:02:09,780 --> 01:02:11,240
He's like,
he's not shredded.

1537
01:02:11,241 --> 01:02:13,910
He doesn't look like it.
Doesn't really say.

1538
01:02:14,110 --> 01:02:17,480
I saw him recently and now it makes 
sense why it's so thick.

1539
01:02:17,481 --> 01:02:21,240
I may have just gotten him,
hasn't fought in a lot of time,

1540
01:02:21,241 --> 01:02:26,241
may have got fucked.
These strikeforce morons because mayhem 

1541
01:02:26,241 --> 01:02:26,241
got in a fight.
There's.

1542
01:02:26,241 --> 01:02:29,160
There was a fight where jake shields 
beat Dan Henderson.

1543
01:02:29,190 --> 01:02:31,650
Awesome fight and it was a big event on 
CBS.

1544
01:02:31,660 --> 01:02:36,660
The CBS event though was a disaster 
because the production was so 

1545
01:02:36,660 --> 01:02:38,190
unorganized way,
way,

1546
01:02:38,191 --> 01:02:43,191
way over the time.
An hour and a half or something over 

1547
01:02:43,191 --> 01:02:43,191
there.
A lot of time.

1548
01:02:43,191 --> 01:02:44,880
So they went into the news.
They went past the news.

1549
01:02:44,881 --> 01:02:46,650
They wanted some other show that was 
very positive.

1550
01:02:46,890 --> 01:02:48,240
It was so bad.
It was so.

1551
01:02:48,270 --> 01:02:50,910
The UFC has never done anything remotely
like this ever.

1552
01:02:51,270 --> 01:02:56,270
I mean,
did they just don't know what they're 

1553
01:02:56,270 --> 01:02:57,351
doing?
They were real raw in the game in any 

1554
01:02:57,351 --> 01:02:57,660
way may have and jake shields had fought
to a very close decision.

1555
01:02:57,661 --> 01:03:02,661
It was a really good fight and at one 
point in time may had jake shields back 

1556
01:03:02,661 --> 01:03:04,740
with a rear naked choke in and jake was 
going out and the bell rang.

1557
01:03:04,741 --> 01:03:06,870
I mean it was locked in.
It was a rap.

1558
01:03:06,871 --> 01:03:09,600
There was no way mayhem was letting go.
He was pumped upon.

1559
01:03:09,720 --> 01:03:12,660
He had the forearm across the neck.
Jake was turning red bull.

1560
01:03:12,750 --> 01:03:17,750
The bell rang and it was.
He wanted a rematch so they let him in 

1561
01:03:17,750 --> 01:03:21,471
the cage and may have interrupted the 
interview between Jake shields and the 

1562
01:03:21,471 --> 01:03:22,440
commentator Gus Johnson and said,
hey,

1563
01:03:22,540 --> 01:03:23,640
you know,
how about my rematch?

1564
01:03:23,641 --> 01:03:26,100
And then jake shields buddies,
they get the fuck out of here.

1565
01:03:26,101 --> 01:03:27,690
And then the nick,
the Nick Diaz,

1566
01:03:27,740 --> 01:03:32,610
Nate Diaz and Jake and Gilbert Melendez,
it turned into a fucking bra on CBS.

1567
01:03:32,760 --> 01:03:33,930
Well,
they blamed man.

1568
01:03:33,931 --> 01:03:35,130
Meanwhile,
mayhem didn't throw.

1569
01:03:35,131 --> 01:03:39,090
The first punch may haven't got beat up.
He was on his back and they were kicking

1570
01:03:39,091 --> 01:03:40,060
him in the head.
Yeah.

1571
01:03:40,110 --> 01:03:42,630
And they're blaming him and so they 
wouldn't let him fight again.

1572
01:03:42,780 --> 01:03:47,780
He couldn't fight on showtime and he 
couldn't fight on CBS and they didn't 

1573
01:03:47,780 --> 01:03:47,780
tell him.
So they were pussies about it.

1574
01:03:47,780 --> 01:03:50,540
So for a fucking year this guy has been 
sitting doing nothing.

1575
01:03:50,550 --> 01:03:52,320
So He's been left in and he's been 
getting bigger.

1576
01:03:52,440 --> 01:03:54,570
You know,
when you don't have to make 185 pounds,

1577
01:03:54,571 --> 01:03:55,920
you just eat whatever the fuck you want 
to eat.

1578
01:03:55,921 --> 01:03:57,570
You don't have anything on the horizon,
you know,

1579
01:03:57,590 --> 01:03:59,820
he gets big.
He's a big boy.

1580
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:01,880
He can fight to a five if he wants to 
know.

1581
01:04:02,060 --> 01:04:04,290
He can walk around easier like to 20 to 
25,

1582
01:04:04,291 --> 01:04:05,660
but you know,
at 85 he's,

1583
01:04:05,690 --> 01:04:06,970
he's big as fuck.
Yeah.

1584
01:04:07,290 --> 01:04:12,290
So he's going to be fighting in the UFC.
Now he's going to be fighting July 

1585
01:04:12,290 --> 01:04:12,290
second.
Erin Simpson.

1586
01:04:12,290 --> 01:04:12,290
You wanna go.

1587
01:04:12,290 --> 01:04:12,830
Oh fuck.
Oh Shit.

1588
01:04:14,040 --> 01:04:15,510
Wait.
You want to go?

1589
01:04:15,690 --> 01:04:16,980
I can't.
No,

1590
01:04:17,070 --> 01:04:17,590
no.
It's July.

1591
01:04:17,591 --> 01:04:18,210
Second.
July.

1592
01:04:18,250 --> 01:04:20,310
Second.
Kalanick Day.

1593
01:04:20,330 --> 01:04:23,070
Got a colonic.
Big Fuck up this weekend.

1594
01:04:23,071 --> 01:04:23,320
Shit man.

1595
01:04:23,330 --> 01:04:25,920
I'm gray maynard.
And I'm Frankie Edgar.

1596
01:04:25,921 --> 01:04:27,510
The flight's canceled.
What happened?

1597
01:04:27,511 --> 01:04:30,180
Five round championship fight.
That's the main event and are canceled.

1598
01:04:30,181 --> 01:04:31,380
Why?
I'm gray.

1599
01:04:31,381 --> 01:04:32,220
Maynard.
Um,

1600
01:04:32,240 --> 01:04:35,430
apparently it hurt his knee,
but he was gonna fight anyway,

1601
01:04:35,460 --> 01:04:36,030
you know,
he was,

1602
01:04:36,200 --> 01:04:41,200
because it was for a title shot so he 
was going to figure out how to just 

1603
01:04:41,200 --> 01:04:41,200
nurses knee.
It's three weeks away,

1604
01:04:41,200 --> 01:04:45,510
but Frankie Edgar broke his ribs and uh,
when his ribs are broken you can't.

1605
01:04:45,630 --> 01:04:48,470
There's no way he's fucked.
Anderson Silva actually fought shale son

1606
01:04:48,471 --> 01:04:51,850
and when a broken rib is either a broken
rib or a separated ribs,

1607
01:04:51,870 --> 01:04:54,180
there's something wrong with his rib.
But uh,

1608
01:04:54,300 --> 01:04:54,840
you know,
and he,

1609
01:04:54,841 --> 01:04:55,960
he took it anyway,
you know,

1610
01:04:55,980 --> 01:04:57,870
he,
I guess he felt like he could still pull

1611
01:04:57,871 --> 01:05:00,810
it off and he did.
But with Edgar apparently was too bad.

1612
01:05:00,811 --> 01:05:05,811
He couldn't do anything.
So Frankie Edgar and gray maynard is 

1613
01:05:05,811 --> 01:05:07,360
going to be moved to somewhere around,
I think they said it,

1614
01:05:07,390 --> 01:05:08,820
depending on how everybody heals up.

1615
01:05:09,060 --> 01:05:11,250
It'll be like late summer,
early fall,

1616
01:05:11,370 --> 01:05:16,370
somewhere around that.
So now I don't know who the main event 

1617
01:05:16,370 --> 01:05:18,711
is.
I think it's going to be rampage versus 

1618
01:05:18,711 --> 01:05:20,241
Matt Hamill.
Nice rick story versus Thiago Alves a 

1619
01:05:20,241 --> 01:05:24,121
big fight on that card too.
That's a fucking nasty fight with a 

1620
01:05:24,121 --> 01:05:24,880
bunch of great with the UFC buying 
strikeforce.

1621
01:05:24,930 --> 01:05:28,750
Is that going to be more events now or 
just bigger events when you do events?

1622
01:05:28,751 --> 01:05:30,190
A good question.
As of right now,

1623
01:05:30,191 --> 01:05:35,191
it's a two different companies and as of
right now they own both and so they can 

1624
01:05:35,191 --> 01:05:38,860
bring guys over like they brought him 
over to the UFC because they own both of

1625
01:05:38,861 --> 01:05:40,840
them and if you fucks aren't gonna fight
them.

1626
01:05:40,870 --> 01:05:45,870
This guy's one of the most popular 
fighters in the world and you idiots 

1627
01:05:45,870 --> 01:05:45,870
aren't fighting.
I'm like,

1628
01:05:45,870 --> 01:05:47,890
what kind of nonsense is so awesome.
I'm so glad that he's going to be in the

1629
01:05:47,891 --> 01:05:48,670
UFC finally.

1630
01:05:48,730 --> 01:05:49,320
Yeah,
yeah,

1631
01:05:49,321 --> 01:05:50,890
that'd be huge for them.
You know,

1632
01:05:51,160 --> 01:05:56,160
it'd be huge and you know what?
He should have been in the UFC a long 

1633
01:05:56,160 --> 01:05:56,160
time ago.
He's,

1634
01:05:56,160 --> 01:06:00,061
you know,
the real problem with strikeforce is 

1635
01:06:00,061 --> 01:06:00,061
what,
I don't remember who said this,

1636
01:06:00,061 --> 01:06:03,070
but it was very astute.
They said that when you,

1637
01:06:03,071 --> 01:06:04,790
um,
when you watch strikeforce,

1638
01:06:04,810 --> 01:06:09,810
what was awesome about it was you got to
see a lot of knockouts and a lot of 

1639
01:06:09,810 --> 01:06:12,841
submissions and sometimes you watch the 
UFC and the guys were so evenly matched 

1640
01:06:12,841 --> 01:06:14,020
that they kind of cancel each other out 
that that is true,

1641
01:06:14,200 --> 01:06:15,940
but it's because there are mismatches 
though.

1642
01:06:16,060 --> 01:06:21,060
One of the reasons why they're so 
exciting is because it's Paul daily 

1643
01:06:21,060 --> 01:06:23,911
versus Scott Smith.
And the reality is Scott Smith really 

1644
01:06:23,911 --> 01:06:26,581
can't stand with Paul daily,
so it does turn out to be a spectacular 

1645
01:06:26,581 --> 01:06:26,581
knockout,
you know?

1646
01:06:26,581 --> 01:06:27,270
So the,
it's,

1647
01:06:27,300 --> 01:06:29,860
it's better that there's more 
competition,

1648
01:06:29,861 --> 01:06:34,861
it's better,
but sometimes the fights aren't nearly 

1649
01:06:34,861 --> 01:06:35,080
as exciting because these guys cancel 
each other out.

1650
01:06:35,260 --> 01:06:40,260
But then sometimes when you get to the 
baddest motherfuckers in the world and 

1651
01:06:40,260 --> 01:06:43,860
you know,
one guy takes a chance like Anderson 

1652
01:06:43,860 --> 01:06:46,350
Silva versus [inaudible] and it winds up
being ultra spectacular and even worth 

1653
01:06:46,350 --> 01:06:48,850
more because you know that these guys 
are the best guys in the fucking world,

1654
01:06:49,330 --> 01:06:50,080
you know.
So it's,

1655
01:06:50,110 --> 01:06:51,250
it's all,
it's,

1656
01:06:51,310 --> 01:06:52,990
you know,
it's all tricky man.

1657
01:06:53,350 --> 01:06:58,350
It's all tricky.
It's going to be better to have all 

1658
01:06:58,350 --> 01:06:58,450
these fighters in,
but they have to figure out what exactly

1659
01:06:58,451 --> 01:07:03,451
they're going to do.
I do miss the mismatches of the old UFC 

1660
01:07:03,451 --> 01:07:03,451
is,
you know,

1661
01:07:03,451 --> 01:07:05,620
like where it's a black belt in Jujitsu 
versus a bartender of the applebee's.

1662
01:07:07,540 --> 01:07:09,420
Yeah,
those are fun as far as like a,

1663
01:07:09,430 --> 01:07:11,380
as a spectacle.
So yeah,

1664
01:07:11,381 --> 01:07:16,381
I guess they just a,
they've moved Tiago Alvarez versus Rick 

1665
01:07:16,381 --> 01:07:17,650
Story to the main card,
but there's a lot of good fights on this

1666
01:07:17,670 --> 01:07:17,880
path.

1667
01:07:17,970 --> 01:07:20,770
Any of those like fight fantasy camps,
you know,

1668
01:07:20,771 --> 01:07:22,270
they have felt like basketball and 
baseball,

1669
01:07:22,271 --> 01:07:24,970
like go down and play with all the 
Yankees and you know,

1670
01:07:25,000 --> 01:07:30,000
that's a good question.
But did they go down and get your 

1671
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:30,000
fucking brains bashed in?
What I would do it,

1672
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:31,390
yeah.
They're always show them how to fuck,

1673
01:07:31,450 --> 01:07:32,800
you know.
So it's like training.

1674
01:07:32,801 --> 01:07:34,090
Yeah,
they should do something like that.

1675
01:07:34,091 --> 01:07:39,091
It's not a bad idea.
Like Miguel Torres versus mighty mouse 

1676
01:07:39,091 --> 01:07:39,490
Johnson.
That is the fucking fight.

1677
01:07:39,760 --> 01:07:41,950
This guy,
demetrius mighty mouse Johnson,

1678
01:07:41,951 --> 01:07:46,951
he fought on spike TV last time we 
fought kid Yamamoto who at one point in 

1679
01:07:46,951 --> 01:07:50,521
time was one of the baddest 
motherfuckers in the world and now he's 

1680
01:07:50,521 --> 01:07:51,940
down to his real weight of 135 pounds.
He could not fuck with this dude.

1681
01:07:51,941 --> 01:07:52,810
This dude,
mighty mouse.

1682
01:07:52,811 --> 01:07:57,100
Johnson is this tiny little guy who 
moves faster than I've ever seen anyone.

1683
01:07:57,190 --> 01:08:02,190
He is the perfect reason,
like the perfect like version of the 135

1684
01:08:03,970 --> 01:08:06,730
pound fighter.
Like if you want an argument like why do

1685
01:08:06,731 --> 01:08:10,780
they have this 135 pound weight class?
Watch that guy because there's nobody at

1686
01:08:10,781 --> 01:08:15,040
one 85 can move like that.
This fucking guy moves like a lightning.

1687
01:08:15,530 --> 01:08:16,160
Just dive

1688
01:08:16,160 --> 01:08:21,160
and under punches.
His double leg takedown is faster than 

1689
01:08:21,160 --> 01:08:21,890
any I've ever seen before and is stand 
up as fast as fuck too.

1690
01:08:22,310 --> 01:08:24,320
So this guy is fighting the former 
champion,

1691
01:08:24,321 --> 01:08:25,310
Miguel Torres.
That's a.

1692
01:08:25,311 --> 01:08:28,040
that's a sick fucking fight.
I hope that's on the main card.

1693
01:08:28,041 --> 01:08:30,500
I think it is.
It might not be.

1694
01:08:30,501 --> 01:08:32,180
It might be a swing bout or something.
They might.

1695
01:08:32,181 --> 01:08:33,030
It might be the spiked.
Oh,

1696
01:08:33,100 --> 01:08:34,820
it is.
I think it's a spike TV fight.

1697
01:08:34,970 --> 01:08:36,530
The strikeforce.
I have girl fighting.

1698
01:08:37,160 --> 01:08:38,390
Yes,
they do have girlfriend.

1699
01:08:38,400 --> 01:08:40,280
Did Dana just cancel all that?
No,

1700
01:08:40,281 --> 01:08:45,281
he didn't cancel all that.
They had this fighter summit where they 

1701
01:08:45,281 --> 01:08:47,681
met and they talked about the uh,
the girl fights and they talked about 

1702
01:08:47,681 --> 01:08:48,220
meeting.
No,

1703
01:08:48,260 --> 01:08:53,260
I've never called a girl fight.
I would have to be monitored official 

1704
01:08:53,260 --> 01:08:54,490
and you have cough.
Carlton wasn't bars.

1705
01:08:56,670 --> 01:08:59,180
Those are always more fun.
Yeah,

1706
01:08:59,390 --> 01:09:00,800
I guess.
I don't know.

1707
01:09:00,830 --> 01:09:05,830
That's why I love watching those youtube
videos of like chicks fighting at 

1708
01:09:05,830 --> 01:09:05,830
Denny's and stuff like that.
Like that one,

1709
01:09:05,830 --> 01:09:10,281
there was all over the place I started 
on deadspin because it's just the 

1710
01:09:10,281 --> 01:09:10,281
people.
Especially when girls fight,

1711
01:09:10,281 --> 01:09:12,600
it's the people you don't.
I don't really give a fuck about how the

1712
01:09:12,601 --> 01:09:17,601
fight.
I love watching the peripheral people 

1713
01:09:17,601 --> 01:09:17,601
like,
oh bitch,

1714
01:09:17,601 --> 01:09:20,440
like just the fuckin grabbed their hand 
fucking whenever.

1715
01:09:20,610 --> 01:09:23,490
It just so much better and more 
animated.

1716
01:09:23,491 --> 01:09:26,070
The people around them just fucking 
calling shit out.

1717
01:09:26,100 --> 01:09:31,100
Do you see that one?
That a couple of weeks ago there was a 

1718
01:09:31,100 --> 01:09:31,100
video going around,
right?

1719
01:09:31,100 --> 01:09:32,900
It was a fight at Denny's where a black 
guy was dressed up as Boba Fett,

1720
01:09:32,930 --> 01:09:37,930
like he must have just got off some star
wars convention and stuff and he's just 

1721
01:09:37,930 --> 01:09:38,680
sitting there videotaping this booth,
next,

1722
01:09:38,900 --> 01:09:43,900
these chicks all fighting with the cop 
and suddenly it is one go swings and 

1723
01:09:43,900 --> 01:09:45,440
tries a punched the cop in the face.
Oh my God.

1724
01:09:45,770 --> 01:09:46,740
Girl.
Down to.

1725
01:09:47,060 --> 01:09:48,800
It's funny how you can go from,
you know,

1726
01:09:48,801 --> 01:09:53,801
trying to be civilized to just smash and
this girl on the ground and just we're 

1727
01:09:53,801 --> 01:09:57,010
putting on your Boba Fett costume and 
then getting to the ground later on that

1728
01:09:57,010 --> 01:10:01,490
night was that Worldstar hip hop.
That one website.

1729
01:10:01,491 --> 01:10:06,491
Worldstar hip hop is the conglomeration 
of the worst beat downs in the history 

1730
01:10:06,491 --> 01:10:09,590
of the Internet dude world still.
Esther was just on there the other day.

1731
01:10:09,591 --> 01:10:14,591
Did you see that for her?
Her video of her asking the sex 

1732
01:10:14,591 --> 01:10:15,410
questions as dressed up as a little 
girl.

1733
01:10:15,530 --> 01:10:17,440
They had her as the video of the week or
something like that.

1734
01:10:17,450 --> 01:10:19,850
They'll put on anything.
It doesn't have to be hip hop related,

1735
01:10:19,851 --> 01:10:23,600
but a lot of it is black people getting 
the fuck beat out of them and do.

1736
01:10:23,601 --> 01:10:28,601
There's one video or one guy's talking 
shit and he gets knocked out and then 

1737
01:10:28,601 --> 01:10:32,000
everybody runs by and punches and kicks.
This guy while he's unconscious,

1738
01:10:32,060 --> 01:10:37,060
it is fucking disturbing.
One guy uses his head like a fucking 

1739
01:10:37,060 --> 01:10:38,240
soccer ball and it just runs up and boot
them in the head.

1740
01:10:38,250 --> 01:10:43,250
Then another guy comes up and punches 
him in the head and they're all doing 

1741
01:10:43,250 --> 01:10:45,761
it.
While this guy's unconscious with his 

1742
01:10:45,761 --> 01:10:45,761
pants down.
It's hard to watch,

1743
01:10:45,761 --> 01:10:46,910
man.
It's human beings,

1744
01:10:46,911 --> 01:10:48,590
man.
When they get away with shit,

1745
01:10:48,680 --> 01:10:50,690
I mean we see it in a little bit on the 
Internet.

1746
01:10:50,691 --> 01:10:53,570
When people are anonymous and they snipe
at you and say evil,

1747
01:10:53,571 --> 01:10:54,320
mean Shit.

1748
01:10:54,410 --> 01:10:56,180
When they know they can get away with 
shit.

1749
01:10:56,330 --> 01:10:58,190
You see the weakness of a human's 
character.

1750
01:10:58,191 --> 01:11:00,080
You see like the lowest person you can 
go.

1751
01:11:00,360 --> 01:11:05,360
There's very few things lower than you 
see a guy who just got knocked the fuck 

1752
01:11:05,360 --> 01:11:05,840
out and you just run over and kick him 
in the head because you can.

1753
01:11:06,350 --> 01:11:11,270
It takes a special kind of fucked up in 
pain human being to do that,

1754
01:11:11,271 --> 01:11:13,650
to dehumanize and unconscious guy like 
that.

1755
01:11:14,010 --> 01:11:19,010
But there's a.
there's a bunch of videos on world star 

1756
01:11:19,010 --> 01:11:19,010
hip hop,
but people doing that.

1757
01:11:19,010 --> 01:11:21,220
Man,
you guys know who mike episodes saw that

1758
01:11:21,390 --> 01:11:22,860
video.
What video?

1759
01:11:23,170 --> 01:11:26,490
Someone's served him while he was 
onstage served him subpoena.

1760
01:11:26,640 --> 01:11:31,640
Really while he's performing the woman.
Just throw it on the stage and then he 

1761
01:11:31,640 --> 01:11:31,810
got.
He went.

1762
01:11:31,860 --> 01:11:36,860
He goes off and say,
you know some bitch just through some 

1763
01:11:36,860 --> 01:11:36,860
papers on the motherfucking bitch.

1764
01:11:36,860 --> 01:11:36,860
Fuck you.
Yeah.

1765
01:11:36,860 --> 01:11:41,780
White pits wipe.
And then he said he admitted to 

1766
01:11:41,780 --> 01:11:44,031
participating in a nightclub bra saying 
this is from when I whooped that Niggas 

1767
01:11:44,031 --> 01:11:48,651
ass and Detroit.
And then he continued to talk about the 

1768
01:11:48,651 --> 01:11:51,960
process server as while she's walking to
the x bitch,

1769
01:11:51,961 --> 01:11:53,640
I don't give a fuck.
Suck my Dick.

1770
01:11:54,660 --> 01:11:59,660
Wow.
On stage in the middle there a 

1771
01:11:59,660 --> 01:11:59,660
transcript of this.
There's a video of it.

1772
01:11:59,660 --> 01:11:59,760
We can live,
we'll think about it.

1773
01:11:59,761 --> 01:12:03,420
We're the only people that like if you 
wanted to kill us or service,

1774
01:12:03,421 --> 01:12:06,330
you know exactly where we are on our 
website.

1775
01:12:07,270 --> 01:12:11,080
Read Azizi will be 8:00.

1777
01:12:16,270 --> 01:12:16,270
tickets here.
Here's the audio from everyone here.

1778
01:12:16,270 --> 01:12:16,710
The audience.
Sure.

1779
01:12:17,690 --> 01:12:18,120
Let's hear it.

1780
01:12:29,820 --> 01:12:33,490
He might as well be right here.
It kill that shit.

1781
01:12:33,550 --> 01:12:34,530
Yeah.
That's like selling as well.

1782
01:12:34,540 --> 01:12:35,860
Be Speaking Martian.
Yeah.

1783
01:12:36,130 --> 01:12:38,350
That guy's got it's Marsha and talk.
I already,

1784
01:12:38,440 --> 01:12:39,340
I don't know.
This is not.

1785
01:12:39,341 --> 01:12:44,341
It may not be true,
but I heard he pull or got a gun pulled 

1786
01:12:44,341 --> 01:12:44,341
on him and pulled a gun on him in the 
middle of a set one time.

1787
01:12:44,530 --> 01:12:45,490
Whoa.
Yeah.

1788
01:12:46,060 --> 01:12:51,060
Joey Cola was performing at pips in 
Brooklyn and there was a guy sitting in 

1789
01:12:51,060 --> 01:12:54,511
the front row that was heckling him and 
the guy pulled up his shirt and showed 

1790
01:12:54,511 --> 01:12:57,691
him a pistol.
I was there the night holtzman got the 

1791
01:12:57,691 --> 01:12:57,850
gun pulled on by the undercover cop.
Really?

1792
01:12:57,880 --> 01:12:58,740
Yeah.
On.

1793
01:12:58,970 --> 01:13:02,590
He was shooting the cops on that guy and
then Holtzman,

1794
01:13:02,591 --> 01:13:04,900
you know,
the guy was an off duty cop.

1795
01:13:05,270 --> 01:13:07,740
The guy pulled the gun out,
but I don't think he,

1796
01:13:07,830 --> 01:13:09,670
you know,
he showed him what I showed the gun.

1797
01:13:09,910 --> 01:13:12,040
Then holtzman just kept going.
Of course,

1798
01:13:12,041 --> 01:13:13,930
you know,
as if this is to say,

1799
01:13:14,020 --> 01:13:14,560
well,
let it,

1800
01:13:14,561 --> 01:13:19,561
let it happen now if it's gonna happen 
and then left and then the guy was in 

1801
01:13:19,561 --> 01:13:20,230
the memories of the parking lot walking 
around and his girlfriend's air.

1802
01:13:20,380 --> 01:13:25,380
That's when he pulled a gun out.
That's when we called the cops and the 

1803
01:13:25,380 --> 01:13:26,590
cops took him around the corner behind 
the House of Blues and let them go.

1804
01:13:26,600 --> 01:13:28,600
Remember,
like they did the big dog and pony show,

1805
01:13:28,601 --> 01:13:30,730
put them in the back of the car,
handcuffed.

1806
01:13:30,731 --> 01:13:32,740
And then we followed them around and 
he'd let him.

1807
01:13:32,770 --> 01:13:34,990
They let him go behind.
He had his wife come pick them up.

1808
01:13:35,020 --> 01:13:36,190
Wow.
Boom.

1809
01:13:36,310 --> 01:13:37,120
Gone.
Well,

1810
01:13:37,121 --> 01:13:38,800
you know,
cops have to look out for their own.

1811
01:13:38,801 --> 01:13:41,200
But that's an embarrassing moment.
He was wasted.

1812
01:13:41,990 --> 01:13:43,240
That's so weak.
I was there.

1813
01:13:43,241 --> 01:13:44,100
I remember that.
Yeah,

1814
01:13:44,140 --> 01:13:44,620
I remember that.

1815
01:13:44,620 --> 01:13:49,620
Vaguely.
I remember that because I was like sort 

1816
01:13:49,620 --> 01:13:49,620
of on the outside of it and when the 
cops came I was like,

1817
01:13:49,620 --> 01:13:50,050
what happened?
Like,

1818
01:13:50,080 --> 01:13:52,750
what kind of a crazy asshole?
Like what do you think?

1819
01:13:52,751 --> 01:13:54,790
You just got to get away with that.
No one's going to call the police.

1820
01:13:55,630 --> 01:14:00,630
He did it just with what a silly man 
thinks he's going to be able to pull a 

1821
01:14:00,630 --> 01:14:00,630
fucking gun out.
Like,

1822
01:14:00,630 --> 01:14:02,220
yeah,
those cops that were uh,

1823
01:14:02,430 --> 01:14:03,530
that used to,
uh,

1824
01:14:03,580 --> 01:14:05,790
patrol that area.
They were cool as for.

1825
01:14:05,800 --> 01:14:06,840
Yeah,
remember that big?

1826
01:14:06,850 --> 01:14:08,050
What the fuck is his name?
Mike?

1827
01:14:08,080 --> 01:14:08,590
Yeah.
They used to.

1828
01:14:08,860 --> 01:14:12,010
I'm used to park on the ramp and just 
come in and out at the sky and

1829
01:14:12,010 --> 01:14:14,070
they've come and watch the show and hang
out and yeah.

1830
01:14:14,200 --> 01:14:14,930
You know,
he,

1831
01:14:14,940 --> 01:14:19,940
I,
I think they all do my truck and he 

1832
01:14:19,940 --> 01:14:19,940
goes,
why does it smell like weed in your car?

1833
01:14:19,940 --> 01:14:21,310
I go because I smoke.
Good weed kind of question.

1834
01:14:21,311 --> 01:14:23,250
Is that it's smelly?
No,

1835
01:14:24,580 --> 01:14:29,580
I think they worked at Kimmel to.
I know Paris was friends with like they 

1836
01:14:29,580 --> 01:14:32,611
do security.
So I used to hook those guys up with a 

1837
01:14:32,611 --> 01:14:32,611
UFC tickets.
Oh really?

1838
01:14:32,611 --> 01:14:32,770
Yeah,
they were cool as fuck.

1839
01:14:32,800 --> 01:14:33,460
Like,
you know,

1840
01:14:33,520 --> 01:14:38,520
who likes watching dudes beat the fuck 
out of each other more than cops and 

1841
01:14:38,920 --> 01:14:42,210
they're all martial artists.
I've known so many cops from Jujitsu.

1842
01:14:42,580 --> 01:14:44,080
You know,
if you're a cop man,

1843
01:14:44,081 --> 01:14:49,081
you better learn how to fight.
You better learn something at some 

1844
01:14:49,081 --> 01:14:49,081
point.
And I'm going to have to have to.

1845
01:14:49,081 --> 01:14:52,870
When I see a guy who like completely out
of shape and like he obviously not 

1846
01:14:52,870 --> 01:14:53,710
skilled and he's a,
he's a cop.

1847
01:14:53,950 --> 01:14:55,690
That's,
that's a scary place to be,

1848
01:14:55,691 --> 01:14:57,520
man.
It's scary to be a cop anyway,

1849
01:14:57,760 --> 01:15:00,570
but it's really scary to be a cop where 
you pull your gun out,

1850
01:15:00,610 --> 01:15:01,180
click,
click,

1851
01:15:01,181 --> 01:15:02,500
click.
The bullets don't work.

1852
01:15:02,740 --> 01:15:04,780
You're unarmed and he's armed.
Now what?

1853
01:15:05,140 --> 01:15:10,140
That's scary as fuck.
You know there was a video of a guy 

1854
01:15:10,140 --> 01:15:10,830
getting loose in prison.
He was a,

1855
01:15:10,840 --> 01:15:15,840
they were handcuffing him and they were 
bringing them somewhere and there was 

1856
01:15:15,840 --> 01:15:17,950
two cops and he just starts beating the 
fuck out of these two cops.

1857
01:15:18,160 --> 01:15:21,010
And they were so helpless.
They did not know how to fight.

1858
01:15:21,130 --> 01:15:23,470
The guy tries to grab a hold of him.
He doesn't have any technique.

1859
01:15:23,650 --> 01:15:25,810
He probably never been blasted in the 
face before,

1860
01:15:25,811 --> 01:15:28,210
so he's freaking the fuck out.
He realizes this wild,

1861
01:15:28,211 --> 01:15:31,760
crazy prisoner is teeing off on him and 
then the other guy tries to jump on him.

1862
01:15:31,780 --> 01:15:34,120
He blasts the other guy.
It was ugly.

1863
01:15:34,240 --> 01:15:36,190
This guy beat the fuck out of two 
security guards.

1864
01:15:36,220 --> 01:15:38,410
Beat the fuck out of them.
Unconscious.

1865
01:15:38,680 --> 01:15:40,330
You know?
They thought two guys would be enough to

1866
01:15:40,331 --> 01:15:45,331
contain them because they didn't know 
how to fight to debt must be the most 

1867
01:15:45,331 --> 01:15:48,250
terrifying place to be.
Not knowing how to fight and being stuck

1868
01:15:48,251 --> 01:15:52,030
with a crazy prisoner who just nothing 
to lose man.

1869
01:15:52,120 --> 01:15:53,920
Especially if the guys like in for 
murder.

1870
01:15:54,040 --> 01:15:56,630
Those guys,
guys that are in for life or what?

1871
01:15:56,650 --> 01:15:57,200
Yeah,
what?

1872
01:15:57,201 --> 01:15:59,680
What do they have to lose?
You're going to get more life.

1873
01:16:00,490 --> 01:16:04,150
What a weird fucking life that must be.
You ever watched those movies?

1874
01:16:04,151 --> 01:16:06,340
Are those documentaries where they go 
into a.

1875
01:16:06,370 --> 01:16:08,470
like there was one of them where they 
went into this.

1876
01:16:08,471 --> 01:16:11,410
One guy was stabbing.
This guy was all on camera,

1877
01:16:11,530 --> 01:16:13,150
I forget what the name of the 
documentary was,

1878
01:16:13,360 --> 01:16:15,520
but he was stabbing this guy in the eye.

1879
01:16:15,520 --> 01:16:18,070
Look over and over and over and over 
again.

1880
01:16:18,071 --> 01:16:23,071
He was stabbing this guy and he was 
screaming out white power and he jumped 

1881
01:16:23,071 --> 01:16:26,491
up and then some white power jumping off
in this motherfucker and this guy is on 

1882
01:16:26,491 --> 01:16:28,390
the ground like barely alive.
100 fucking holes in his head.

1883
01:16:28,540 --> 01:16:31,630
He's just stabbing them over and over 
again in the head.

1884
01:16:31,990 --> 01:16:33,010
I'm like,
wow.

1885
01:16:33,040 --> 01:16:36,130
Like that.
This is a totally different world.

1886
01:16:36,490 --> 01:16:38,350
Totally different.
There's levels,

1887
01:16:38,351 --> 01:16:42,160
there's a spectrum of human behavior,
and when you see that spectrum,

1888
01:16:42,161 --> 01:16:45,640
when you see like that Mexican lady last
week,

1889
01:16:45,641 --> 01:16:47,980
there was a video of some cartel woman 
shopping.

1890
01:16:47,981 --> 01:16:51,100
Some guy's head off slowly and then 
skinny his face.

1891
01:16:51,250 --> 01:16:53,190
They skin his face and then they show 
that,

1892
01:16:53,250 --> 01:16:55,870
put it all on video.
When you get to that level,

1893
01:16:55,960 --> 01:16:58,090
there's levels of humanity where it's 
just like,

1894
01:16:58,240 --> 01:17:03,240
whoa.
Like when you hear about like what Vlad 

1895
01:17:03,240 --> 01:17:06,541
the impaler used to do,
the guy that was responsible for the 

1896
01:17:06,541 --> 01:17:09,770
legend of Dracula,
the legend of Dracula came from an 

1897
01:17:09,770 --> 01:17:10,460
actual man who was such a ruthless 
motherfucker.

1898
01:17:10,590 --> 01:17:13,610
They do would impale people on sticks 
and keep their head on a stick,

1899
01:17:13,611 --> 01:17:14,630
right?
Their whole body,

1900
01:17:14,631 --> 01:17:19,631
their head parts of their body and he 
would eat them and eat their flesh 

1901
01:17:19,631 --> 01:17:20,330
flashing would force them to eat each 
other.

1902
01:17:20,510 --> 01:17:23,180
He would cut their pieces up and cook it
and feed into each other.

1903
01:17:23,360 --> 01:17:24,380
Yeah.
And then when people would,

1904
01:17:24,400 --> 01:17:26,660
it would leave them up there for months 
and people would come over,

1905
01:17:26,740 --> 01:17:29,120
know his house like yes,
fucking some people are killed the other

1906
01:17:29,121 --> 01:17:32,640
day he wanted to make sure that 
everybody knew he was a bad motherfucker

1907
01:17:32,641 --> 01:17:35,570
and do not fuck with me.
I'm taking shit to the next level.

1908
01:17:37,940 --> 01:17:42,940
You may be willing to die,
but he'd be willing to be put on a 

1909
01:17:42,940 --> 01:17:44,390
fucking stick and have me for the next 
three days when things happen.

1910
01:17:44,391 --> 01:17:49,391
Man,
when you hear about like people kicking 

1911
01:17:49,391 --> 01:17:49,391
shit up to the,
the,

1912
01:17:49,391 --> 01:17:49,391
the,
the highest,

1913
01:17:49,391 --> 01:17:53,201
scariest notches.
Like one of the scariest things that I 

1914
01:17:53,201 --> 01:17:53,201
ever read was about,
uh,

1915
01:17:53,201 --> 01:17:57,310
people that had arrived,
the first people that arrived in 

1916
01:17:57,310 --> 01:18:00,700
encountered native Americans and some of
the fucked up things they did to the 

1917
01:18:00,700 --> 01:18:02,880
native American babies dash their heads 
on rocks.

1918
01:18:02,881 --> 01:18:04,760
Like pick them up by their feet and 
dashed on the rocks.

1919
01:18:04,880 --> 01:18:09,880
And there was all.
This is the Columbus man in Columbus is 

1920
01:18:09,880 --> 01:18:11,921
boys.
Dude Columbus was essentially a mass 

1921
01:18:11,921 --> 01:18:14,261
murderer.
Columbus was essentially a serial 

1922
01:18:14,261 --> 01:18:14,261
killer.
You know,

1923
01:18:14,261 --> 01:18:14,261
the,
the,

1924
01:18:14,261 --> 01:18:14,630
what those people had done,
Columbia's.

1925
01:18:14,631 --> 01:18:16,580
And then the people that,
that came with him,

1926
01:18:16,730 --> 01:18:18,740
what they had done to the native 
Americans that were there.

1927
01:18:18,890 --> 01:18:20,690
You know,
I don't know if there was resistance,

1928
01:18:20,691 --> 01:18:21,110
if,
you know,

1929
01:18:21,111 --> 01:18:26,111
the native Americans attacked first.
I Dunno what the fuck started it all 

1930
01:18:26,111 --> 01:18:29,081
off.
But if you really go into like the 

1931
01:18:29,081 --> 01:18:29,120
ancient,
like I was writing a script once,

1932
01:18:29,121 --> 01:18:30,500
at one point in time was writing a 
movie,

1933
01:18:31,220 --> 01:18:34,290
a Werewolf movie about the old West.
It was like a long time ago,

1934
01:18:34,291 --> 01:18:36,290
like 10 years ago,
as as I'm writing this,

1935
01:18:36,291 --> 01:18:39,980
I started really getting into the old 
west and reading all these stories about

1936
01:18:39,981 --> 01:18:44,981
all these different battles and the 
fucking brutality on both sides.

1937
01:18:45,531 --> 01:18:50,531
The brutality that the horrible shit 
that people would do were American 

1938
01:18:50,531 --> 01:18:53,450
soldiers would cut the pussy out of dead
in a American Indians,

1939
01:18:53,540 --> 01:18:55,730
cut their pussy out and wear it on their
hats.

1940
01:18:56,300 --> 01:18:57,860
I was like a thing that they did all the
time.

1941
01:18:59,210 --> 01:19:00,740
That's probably why they did it.
Why?

1942
01:19:00,741 --> 01:19:02,540
Because they turned to their other 
buddies and your body's.

1943
01:19:03,580 --> 01:19:07,070
It probably is why the reaction still 
hasn't changed.

1944
01:19:07,160 --> 01:19:09,640
It's also to let people know that you,
you're,

1945
01:19:09,670 --> 01:19:12,980
you're taking shit to the next level and
you know,

1946
01:19:12,981 --> 01:19:16,640
and everybody has this romanticized 
vision of how the American Indians lived

1947
01:19:16,641 --> 01:19:21,641
and they were in peace and harmony.
Yes and no because they weren't 

1948
01:19:21,641 --> 01:19:23,450
impatient.
Harmony with themselves all the time.

1949
01:19:23,480 --> 01:19:25,400
The Sioux Indians,
for example,

1950
01:19:25,520 --> 01:19:27,020
like the,
the term sue,

1951
01:19:27,200 --> 01:19:30,050
that's not what they call themselves.
They call themselves as look.

1952
01:19:30,080 --> 01:19:32,180
The Cota,
they were the Lakota people.

1953
01:19:32,330 --> 01:19:35,390
The other Indians called them the sue.
Because sue means enemy,

1954
01:19:36,290 --> 01:19:41,290
so there is yes,
because these motherfuckers would just 

1955
01:19:41,290 --> 01:19:43,811
the biggest,
baddest motherfuckers and they would 

1956
01:19:43,811 --> 01:19:45,491
come in and kick ass on the other 
Indians and rape their women and kill 

1957
01:19:45,491 --> 01:19:45,960
everybody.
And so they called them to sue sue,

1958
01:19:47,000 --> 01:19:49,460
what a weird way to live though.
Riding around on animals,

1959
01:19:49,461 --> 01:19:52,610
shooting fucking pointed sticks at other
animals with my pussy hat.

1960
01:19:52,700 --> 01:19:57,700
And by the way,
that they didn't even have horses until 

1961
01:19:57,700 --> 01:19:57,750
the Spaniards arrived,
until they brought them over.

1962
01:19:58,280 --> 01:20:03,280
When the Europeans arrived,
that's when they started riding horses 

1963
01:20:03,280 --> 01:20:05,720
before they were living like this crazy 
nomadic life of thousands of years ago.

1964
01:20:05,721 --> 01:20:08,040
Like they had nothing going on.
They didn't have the wheel,

1965
01:20:08,041 --> 01:20:13,041
they didn't have shit happening.
They were living in this weird 

1966
01:20:13,041 --> 01:20:13,041
harmonious,
almost like animal,

1967
01:20:13,041 --> 01:20:15,000
like advanced animal life.
You know,

1968
01:20:15,150 --> 01:20:15,720
they would,
uh,

1969
01:20:15,750 --> 01:20:20,750
they would do a lot of hunts where they 
would do hunts by exhaustion where they 

1970
01:20:20,750 --> 01:20:25,461
would follow a deer and a warrior would 
chase a deer down and literally run at 

1971
01:20:26,101 --> 01:20:29,100
that deer until that deer died of 
exhaustion.

1972
01:20:29,310 --> 01:20:31,620
And then they would kill it and then 
they would all eat it,

1973
01:20:31,680 --> 01:20:36,300
but they would chase them for miles.
They just were in such incredible shape.

1974
01:20:36,450 --> 01:20:38,910
And they had.
Well they had to do this to stay alive.

1975
01:20:39,180 --> 01:20:40,260
You know,
when you don't want to have,

1976
01:20:40,450 --> 01:20:45,450
you know,
when you don't have a horse to chase 

1977
01:20:45,450 --> 01:20:45,450
after something,
you have to chase after it on foot,

1978
01:20:45,450 --> 01:20:47,410
you know?
And if maybe your bows and arrows suck,

1979
01:20:47,460 --> 01:20:49,050
you know,
maybe you haven't figured that out yet.

1980
01:20:49,200 --> 01:20:52,500
So you're living like people live 
thousands and thousands of years ago.

1981
01:20:52,650 --> 01:20:56,010
So in Europe they had written language,
they had culture,

1982
01:20:56,011 --> 01:21:01,011
they had plays,
they had all this shit going on there 

1983
01:21:01,011 --> 01:21:03,090
were so advanced as far as society.
And then you would come to North America

1984
01:21:03,091 --> 01:21:06,300
and there was savages like literally I 
get,

1985
01:21:06,390 --> 01:21:08,040
I get,
I sometimes I'm so tired,

1986
01:21:08,041 --> 01:21:09,750
I'm like,
I'm not even going to walk to the store.

1987
01:21:10,310 --> 01:21:12,960
Just the shit that I was already been 
killed for me.

1988
01:21:13,440 --> 01:21:14,290
I know.
Right.

1989
01:21:14,310 --> 01:21:19,310
And then you got to get out of the car.
I watched true grit the other day to 

1990
01:21:19,310 --> 01:21:19,310
like it.

1991
01:21:19,310 --> 01:21:23,570
It was a good man.
The new one is good and he's a good 

1992
01:21:23,570 --> 01:21:23,570
actor.
Fucking Jeff Bridges,

1993
01:21:23,570 --> 01:21:23,610
Bro.
Yeah,

1994
01:21:23,611 --> 01:21:25,560
he's a bad motherfucker.
He's really good.

1995
01:21:25,561 --> 01:21:30,561
Matt Damon was going to.
Everybody was good and the little girl 

1996
01:21:30,561 --> 01:21:30,561
was good.
It's a good move.

1997
01:21:30,561 --> 01:21:31,560
That was her first thing ever.
She didn't really an episode of like,

1998
01:21:32,300 --> 01:21:34,440
I dunno,
like modern family and the miss.

1999
01:21:34,890 --> 01:21:37,110
She's fucking good man.
She can act her ass off.

2000
01:21:37,470 --> 01:21:40,680
But you look at that movie and you see 
the hardships of the time,

2001
01:21:40,681 --> 01:21:42,440
like how people were,
you know,

2002
01:21:42,441 --> 01:21:47,441
what,
what you know with the ship they had to 

2003
01:21:47,441 --> 01:21:47,640
go through back then just just riding 
around on animals.

2004
01:21:47,700 --> 01:21:51,570
Like just that alone.
You get on this stupid stinky train that

2005
01:21:51,571 --> 01:21:54,270
goes like 30 miles an hour or you have 
to ride an animal.

2006
01:21:54,960 --> 01:21:57,180
Your call,
your call,

2007
01:21:57,210 --> 01:22:00,600
everything kills you.
I know you get a cold.

2008
01:22:00,630 --> 01:22:02,250
Mostly.
Most likely you're going to die.

2009
01:22:02,340 --> 01:22:03,930
That reminds me your joke.
I don't know.

2010
01:22:04,000 --> 01:22:05,580
I probably don't.
I don't do it anymore.

2011
01:22:05,581 --> 01:22:07,710
The one we were like an half your 
family.

2012
01:22:08,080 --> 01:22:10,800
If you travel across the country and 
half,

2013
01:22:10,801 --> 01:22:12,660
your family's going to die on the trip.
Yeah.

2014
01:22:12,960 --> 01:22:15,330
Half of you are going to die.
You're never going to make it.

2015
01:22:15,450 --> 01:22:16,440
Yeah,
man.

2016
01:22:16,990 --> 01:22:21,990
I remember how that goes,
but I don't remember what stage court 

2017
01:22:21,990 --> 01:22:23,610
dates,
the whole thing.

2018
01:22:23,611 --> 01:22:24,900
You were like,
this is where we live now.

2019
01:22:25,320 --> 01:22:26,880
Yeah,
because you just got your.

2020
01:22:26,881 --> 01:22:27,920
The lazy ones.
You're like the.

2021
01:22:27,921 --> 01:22:30,870
I love the idea was the only people in 
Paducah,

2022
01:22:30,871 --> 01:22:35,871
Kentucky aren't in Paducah because 
producers the shit in Paducah because 

2023
01:22:35,871 --> 01:22:37,380
there were walking across the country 
and when went food hood.

2024
01:22:37,460 --> 01:22:39,360
Exactly.
Stub here and fuck,

2025
01:22:41,020 --> 01:22:42,810
and they just stayed in some shitty 
spot.

2026
01:22:43,290 --> 01:22:45,780
Who the fuck would want to just keep 
doing it though?

2027
01:22:46,440 --> 01:22:48,590
God,
it's hard because you know you would.

2028
01:22:48,840 --> 01:22:49,830
You would survive,
man.

2029
01:22:49,831 --> 01:22:52,110
It's like when you watch lost,
it all makes sense.

2030
01:22:52,111 --> 01:22:54,840
They crash on this plane that crashed 
their plane on this island.

2031
01:22:55,050 --> 01:22:57,750
The survivors learn how to eat coconuts 
and this is what we do now.

2032
01:22:57,751 --> 01:22:59,580
Our society is here.
This is where we live now.

2033
01:22:59,990 --> 01:23:01,080
You know what I mean?
It makes sense,

2034
01:23:01,081 --> 01:23:02,880
but that's what you do.
It's what you would do to,

2035
01:23:03,060 --> 01:23:06,580
you would form some new society and new 
in the woods,

2036
01:23:06,700 --> 01:23:11,700
you know,
and you would figure out how to fucking 

2037
01:23:11,700 --> 01:23:12,880
use coconuts to go retrieve water from 
the little little fountain.

2038
01:23:13,180 --> 01:23:14,800
You know,
this is what we do now.

2039
01:23:14,950 --> 01:23:16,630
You would do it until you died,
you know,

2040
01:23:16,631 --> 01:23:18,520
because the alternative is like,
what are you gonna do?

2041
01:23:18,521 --> 01:23:23,521
You're gonna commit suicide and get to 
the highest cliff and dropped down and 

2042
01:23:23,521 --> 01:23:26,640
bash your head on the rocks because you 
can't handle what thousands of years of 

2043
01:23:26,640 --> 01:23:26,640
people have handled before you.

2044
01:23:26,640 --> 01:23:28,790
It may not be like,
I don't,

2045
01:23:28,810 --> 01:23:30,670
I don't have like,
I can't get Suntan.

2046
01:23:30,940 --> 01:23:33,620
I'll burn.
So I have two days of fat.

2047
01:23:33,980 --> 01:23:35,290
He's Italian though.
Yeah,

2048
01:23:35,291 --> 01:23:38,280
but I'm half Irish and the Irish is 
dominated.

2049
01:23:38,320 --> 01:23:39,580
Burn.
I burned dude,

2050
01:23:39,940 --> 01:23:42,250
so I'm going to have.
I know like in my mind I'm like,

2051
01:23:42,251 --> 01:23:43,630
yeah,
we'll figure it out.

2052
01:23:43,631 --> 01:23:45,460
But I got a week of fucking sunburned 
anatomy.

2053
01:23:45,670 --> 01:23:48,520
I'm like,
you gotta stay in the Sun.

2054
01:23:48,521 --> 01:23:50,470
Where are you going to poop all over you
or something.

2055
01:23:50,500 --> 01:23:53,710
It's weird how human beings have evolved
to different climates.

2056
01:23:53,711 --> 01:23:56,180
Like if you go to Ireland,
everyone in Ireland is white,

2057
01:23:56,181 --> 01:23:59,050
white paper,
white as fuck because it's rainy all the

2058
01:23:59,051 --> 01:24:00,760
time and they don't have to deal with 
the clouds.

2059
01:24:00,761 --> 01:24:03,240
They don't have to deal with the sun,
no sticky teas.

2060
01:24:03,700 --> 01:24:08,700
But then you know when you get a place 
like America and it's like this weird 

2061
01:24:08,700 --> 01:24:11,670
melting pot and people,
their genetics have come from all these 

2062
01:24:11,670 --> 01:24:11,670
different places and now now all this,
mix it together.

2063
01:24:11,670 --> 01:24:14,980
Some strange environments where you get 
like blonde people in Phoenix.

2064
01:24:15,210 --> 01:24:20,210
You know,
if you're a blonde person living in 

2065
01:24:20,210 --> 01:24:20,210
Phoenix,
Arizona,

2066
01:24:20,210 --> 01:24:22,980
you got exactly 10 hours every year of 
being in the sun getting baked down 

2067
01:24:24,160 --> 01:24:26,120
before you start developing cancer.
Yep.

2068
01:24:26,260 --> 01:24:26,940
You know,
you,

2069
01:24:26,941 --> 01:24:27,520
you,
you better.

2070
01:24:27,790 --> 01:24:30,670
You get 365 days of the year and add 
those days.

2071
01:24:30,671 --> 01:24:35,350
You got about 10 hours were maybe if you
ration it off over the course of a year,

2072
01:24:35,470 --> 01:24:40,470
you can survive being outside,
but if you want to be some sort of a 

2073
01:24:40,470 --> 01:24:41,100
fucking farmer or if you like fishing 
and your,

2074
01:24:41,101 --> 01:24:41,520
you know,
your,

2075
01:24:41,521 --> 01:24:46,521
your arms are always outside in the sun.
You're going to develop some weird shit 

2076
01:24:46,521 --> 01:24:46,521
on your arm now,
you know,

2077
01:24:46,521 --> 01:24:47,980
that's.
There's radiation,

2078
01:24:47,981 --> 01:24:52,981
there's,
I've seen like I've been on boats 

2079
01:24:52,981 --> 01:24:55,171
before,
like fishermen you talking about like 

2080
01:24:55,171 --> 01:24:55,171
that dudes that looked like me,
but just like when they take their shirt

2081
01:24:55,171 --> 01:24:56,650
off,
but like their arms and their face.

2082
01:24:56,650 --> 01:24:58,660
Thousand years old.
Fucking leather bags,

2083
01:24:59,010 --> 01:24:59,710
dude.
Yeah,

2084
01:24:59,800 --> 01:25:01,570
thousand years old.
Being in the sun all the time.

2085
01:25:01,571 --> 01:25:03,310
It's terrible for you.
It's weird.

2086
01:25:03,311 --> 01:25:06,400
It's like this giant nuclear explosion.
It's millions of miles away.

2087
01:25:06,401 --> 01:25:08,500
It keeps us alive,
but it also wants to kill us.

2088
01:25:08,820 --> 01:25:10,300
Yeah,
we need it,

2089
01:25:10,301 --> 01:25:13,240
but it wants.
It wants us to die and if we move just a

2090
01:25:13,241 --> 01:25:18,241
little bit too far away from it,
we freeze to death a little bit too 

2091
01:25:18,241 --> 01:25:22,180
close and all the water evaporates and 
we cook the delicate balance.

2092
01:25:22,270 --> 01:25:27,270
You know?
The only reason why we're able to live 

2093
01:25:27,270 --> 01:25:27,700
on this planet in this environment is 
stable at all,

2094
01:25:27,820 --> 01:25:30,490
is because of our moon.
Our Moon is so large.

2095
01:25:30,491 --> 01:25:34,600
Our Moon is one quarter of the size of 
the earth and it's in a stationary orbit

2096
01:25:34,601 --> 01:25:39,601
and it keeps our orbit stationary.
It's gravity interacts with our gravity 

2097
01:25:39,601 --> 01:25:43,250
and it keeps us in a,
in a stable path where every year we're,

2098
01:25:43,300 --> 01:25:48,300
you know,
it doesn't get too cold and it goes and 

2099
01:25:48,300 --> 01:25:48,300
doesn't get too hot.

2100
01:25:48,300 --> 01:25:48,300
It doesn't vary too much.
But other planets,

2101
01:25:48,300 --> 01:25:52,470
some planets have elliptical orbits 
where their distance between the sun 

2102
01:25:52,470 --> 01:25:52,470
and,
and,

2103
01:25:52,470 --> 01:25:53,740
and rapidly grow.
Yeah,

2104
01:25:53,741 --> 01:25:55,270
radically.
You know,

2105
01:25:55,271 --> 01:25:57,900
and it's also like the angle that you 
turn,

2106
01:25:58,010 --> 01:26:01,180
like the moon doesn't turn the moon is 
it follows us.

2107
01:26:01,181 --> 01:26:03,680
The same face faces us all the time,
you know,

2108
01:26:03,681 --> 01:26:08,681
it spins around with us,
but it spins around with us with the 

2109
01:26:08,681 --> 01:26:09,740
same look.
Whereas other planets spin,

2110
01:26:10,320 --> 01:26:13,730
they spin and they have crazy orbits.
Like if you look at the orbits,

2111
01:26:13,910 --> 01:26:16,190
we would think that orbits would all be 
circular,

2112
01:26:16,400 --> 01:26:17,610
but they're not like,
I'm just,

2113
01:26:17,630 --> 01:26:18,290
I've just.
Well,

2114
01:26:18,291 --> 01:26:21,860
I just started realizing this when I 
started studying all those Zacharias and

2115
01:26:21,861 --> 01:26:24,560
stuff,
we started talking about a new bureau,

2116
01:26:24,590 --> 01:26:29,590
this ancient Sumerian.
So the oldest known civilization as far 

2117
01:26:29,590 --> 01:26:30,230
as like written language and 
mathematics.

2118
01:26:30,470 --> 01:26:32,870
They talked according to the hitching 
guy.

2119
01:26:32,870 --> 01:26:36,470
A lot of people have doubted what he 
says and have contradicted him,

2120
01:26:36,471 --> 01:26:39,260
but he said that there was a planet that
was 3000,

2121
01:26:39,261 --> 01:26:42,280
600 miles away or 300,
3000,

2122
01:26:42,400 --> 01:26:43,700
3000,
600 years.

2123
01:26:43,820 --> 01:26:48,820
This planet that's on this crazy 
elliptical orbit comes between Mars and 

2124
01:26:48,820 --> 01:26:52,511
Jupiter and that there's an.
I thought about this and I was like our 

2125
01:26:52,511 --> 01:26:56,801
planet's elliptical.
Like what is that even possible that 

2126
01:26:56,801 --> 01:27:00,071
something would.
And if you want to know what elliptical 

2127
01:27:00,071 --> 01:27:00,071
is,
elliptical is like.

2128
01:27:00,071 --> 01:27:00,720
Nascar is instead of a circle,
you know,

2129
01:27:00,740 --> 01:27:02,270
it's like a long.
Yeah,

2130
01:27:02,310 --> 01:27:03,450
an oval.
Yeah,

2131
01:27:03,451 --> 01:27:04,640
like an oval.
Well,

2132
01:27:04,670 --> 01:27:09,670
apparently there's a lot of planet third
elliptical a lot and binary star 

2133
01:27:09,670 --> 01:27:14,111
systems.
There's a lot of binary star systems 

2134
01:27:14,111 --> 01:27:14,111
too,
like.

2135
01:27:14,111 --> 01:27:16,930
And that's one of the things they think 
that they suspect might be outside of 

2136
01:27:16,930 --> 01:27:17,870
Pluto.
Like there's all this speculation lately

2137
01:27:17,871 --> 01:27:22,871
about there's something wrong with the 
moon's gravity and the way the moon's 

2138
01:27:22,871 --> 01:27:26,921
orbit is that it's reflective of some 
are larger body in the solar system and 

2139
01:27:26,921 --> 01:27:30,791
there's also a lot of evidence of 
something called the galactic shelf and 

2140
01:27:30,791 --> 01:27:30,791
the Kuyper belt.

2141
01:27:30,791 --> 01:27:31,940
And all these asteroids that are around 
the,

2142
01:27:31,941 --> 01:27:35,030
the,
the real outskirts of our solar system,

2143
01:27:35,031 --> 01:27:40,031
like outside of Pluto or apparently 
there's like a big dropoff and they're 

2144
01:27:40,031 --> 01:27:44,140
really quite sure that there's some 
large body out there and it's probably 

2145
01:27:44,241 --> 01:27:49,130
four times the size of Jupiter,
at least Jupiter is fucking enormous.

2146
01:27:49,550 --> 01:27:52,670
So they think that this might be a brown
dwarf star,

2147
01:27:52,700 --> 01:27:55,370
that we might actually have a binary 
star system,

2148
01:27:55,670 --> 01:27:58,400
but that this other star is way the fuck
out there.

2149
01:27:58,401 --> 01:28:02,300
And it's like it's a brown dwarf and I 
guess you can't see them that well.

2150
01:28:02,480 --> 01:28:05,450
I guess it's very difficult to figure 
out where the fuck it is and spot it and

2151
01:28:05,451 --> 01:28:08,030
they haven't been able to locate it yet.
But there's so little.

2152
01:28:08,031 --> 01:28:10,340
We know about this whole fucking thing 
that we live in.

2153
01:28:10,700 --> 01:28:13,280
Look how long it's been.
And look how we've,

2154
01:28:13,370 --> 01:28:14,420
we haven't even,
you know,

2155
01:28:14,570 --> 01:28:16,190
we haven't sent the human to Mars.

2156
01:28:17,360 --> 01:28:19,610
That's technically.
If you look at the whole thing,

2157
01:28:19,611 --> 01:28:24,611
it's like our backs.
We haven't even gone off our back porch 

2158
01:28:24,611 --> 01:28:27,251
yet.
Even into the fucking yard or the pool 

2159
01:28:27,251 --> 01:28:27,251
or wherever.
You know.

2160
01:28:27,251 --> 01:28:28,760
And most people believe we went to the 
moon.

2161
01:28:28,761 --> 01:28:32,240
I'm skeptical still,
but in that sounds ridiculous to say,

2162
01:28:32,241 --> 01:28:34,880
but we haven't been back since 1972,
you know,

2163
01:28:34,881 --> 01:28:37,480
and I know people say so if the 
funding's yeah,

2164
01:28:37,790 --> 01:28:41,150
it seems to me like there's some fucking
shenanigans going on.

2165
01:28:41,390 --> 01:28:42,670
I've,
I've looked very,

2166
01:28:42,671 --> 01:28:47,671
very closely at the whole moon landing 
thing and it's a ridiculous subject to 

2167
01:28:47,671 --> 01:28:50,390
bring up because even me saying it and 
hearing my own voice questioning it,

2168
01:28:50,391 --> 01:28:52,910
I sound like a retard.
I sound like a retard to me,

2169
01:28:53,420 --> 01:28:54,990
but I can't.
I still can't buy it.

2170
01:28:54,991 --> 01:28:56,360
One hundred percent.
I just don't.

2171
01:28:56,630 --> 01:28:57,600
Nineteen,
69,

2172
01:28:57,650 --> 01:28:59,180
1972.
There were seven trips.

2173
01:28:59,181 --> 01:29:02,010
Six successful.
It's the only time in human history that

2174
01:29:02,011 --> 01:29:05,010
humans have been above 400 miles of the 
earth's surface.

2175
01:29:05,010 --> 01:29:07,950
Only the Apollo missions in the Apollo 
missions before that as well.

2176
01:29:08,190 --> 01:29:09,330
No,
no,

2177
01:29:09,450 --> 01:29:14,450
no biological entity from the United 
States ever went into space and came 

2178
01:29:14,450 --> 01:29:17,931
back alive except humans.
We never even sent a chicken around the 

2179
01:29:17,931 --> 01:29:21,471
moon and see if it survives.
We just threw them out into deep space 

2180
01:29:21,471 --> 01:29:22,940
and threw them out into an extreme 
radiation and,

2181
01:29:22,941 --> 01:29:25,890
and they returned successfully every 
single time and yet we haven't been able

2182
01:29:25,891 --> 01:29:30,300
to go back since 1972.
Every other man made or a manned mission

2183
01:29:30,420 --> 01:29:34,080
from that point on,
it's only been up to 400 miles,

2184
01:29:34,081 --> 01:29:36,060
like under 400 miles of the earth's 
surface.

2185
01:29:36,210 --> 01:29:41,210
They went 260,000
miles out and back would have did it in 

2186
01:29:41,210 --> 01:29:45,081
72 men.
Nineteen 69 to 72 and people will say 

2187
01:29:45,081 --> 01:29:45,081
all kinds of things.
We to have you.

2188
01:29:45,081 --> 01:29:45,470
It's,
you know,

2189
01:29:45,480 --> 01:29:48,210
they would've pulled the trigger and 
told on us if that was the case.

2190
01:29:48,290 --> 01:29:53,290
May Be.
But who the fuck knows what kind of 

2191
01:29:53,290 --> 01:29:54,210
weird shit goes on when people are 
actually running countries?

2192
01:29:54,211 --> 01:29:56,550
Who knows what kind of deals they have?
Who knows what the lakes.

2193
01:29:56,670 --> 01:29:57,960
Yeah,
exactly.

2194
01:29:57,961 --> 01:29:58,380
No,
it's.

2195
01:29:58,530 --> 01:30:03,530
He might know.
He knows now there's no wiki leaks and 

2196
01:30:03,530 --> 01:30:03,530
69.
He would have said it though.

2197
01:30:03,530 --> 01:30:03,530
He knows,
right.

2198
01:30:03,630 --> 01:30:05,200
He would have liked that.
That was the first thing.

2199
01:30:05,400 --> 01:30:07,560
Why would that be in wikileaks?
I mean,

2200
01:30:07,561 --> 01:30:09,810
who the fuck needs to know if they 
actually faked the moon landing?

2201
01:30:09,811 --> 01:30:12,300
So who needs to know a few people,
you know,

2202
01:30:13,020 --> 01:30:13,750
like,
uh,

2203
01:30:13,950 --> 01:30:18,950
everyone in the space station.
What's the fuck is the guy that made a 

2204
01:30:18,950 --> 01:30:20,220
2001 a space odyssey?
Oh,

2205
01:30:20,221 --> 01:30:25,221
I'm Kubrick Stanley Kubrick Kubrick.
That was the number one conspiratory 

2206
01:30:25,221 --> 01:30:30,020
speculate of a guy that they said that 
Kubrick was probably in on it and that 

2207
01:30:30,211 --> 01:30:31,170
he,
uh,

2208
01:30:31,320 --> 01:30:32,280
you know,
because of,

2209
01:30:32,281 --> 01:30:33,010
uh,
he had uh,

2210
01:30:33,040 --> 01:30:38,040
a relationship with NASA and NASA came 
to him for some things and he borrowed 

2211
01:30:38,040 --> 01:30:39,990
the cameras from it or something like 
that,

2212
01:30:39,991 --> 01:30:40,710
if I remember.

2213
01:30:41,690 --> 01:30:44,250
It's a total retard argument.
I understand folks.

2214
01:30:44,280 --> 01:30:49,280
And if you're here listening,
you'll fucking Rogan minimum on follow 

2215
01:30:49,280 --> 01:30:50,070
on twitter.
No longer fair.

2216
01:30:50,090 --> 01:30:53,040
And we were there and I was a proud 
American.

2217
01:30:53,250 --> 01:30:55,900
First of all is not.
We know nothing.

2218
01:30:56,470 --> 01:30:58,470
Nothing to do with us.
This is us in,

2219
01:30:58,500 --> 01:31:01,110
in 1969 is not you dude.
Those,

2220
01:31:01,111 --> 01:31:04,500
those different things.
I maybe we did go.

2221
01:31:04,560 --> 01:31:09,560
It's very possible that we did go or 
it's very possible that the whole thing 

2222
01:31:09,560 --> 01:31:09,560
was a fucking hoax.
I think we went,

2223
01:31:09,560 --> 01:31:11,610
but I think it's possible.
I wouldn't be shocked,

2224
01:31:11,790 --> 01:31:16,790
but I've talked to people that really 
truly believed that we went and it 

2225
01:31:16,790 --> 01:31:17,700
sounds to me a lot like religion.
They're not really into.

2226
01:31:17,850 --> 01:31:21,030
They're not willing to question it.
That keeps saying what are the odds?

2227
01:31:21,060 --> 01:31:23,940
It's impossible to fake this look.
They faked a lot of shit.

2228
01:31:24,090 --> 01:31:27,150
They faked the Gulf of Tonkin incident,
that goddess in the Vietnam War.

2229
01:31:27,240 --> 01:31:28,950
They were going to fake operation 
northwoods.

2230
01:31:28,951 --> 01:31:33,951
You're going to blow up civilian 
airliners and blame it on the Cubans to 

2231
01:31:33,951 --> 01:31:33,951
get us to go to war with Cuba.
They're gonna arm,

2232
01:31:33,951 --> 01:31:36,150
Cuban friendlies and attack.
Wanted them obey.

2233
01:31:36,360 --> 01:31:39,040
This is all shit that was not Alex 
Jones.

2234
01:31:39,041 --> 01:31:41,250
Ladies and gentlemen,
black helicopters.

2235
01:31:41,400 --> 01:31:43,110
This is real shit.
This is not.

2236
01:31:43,111 --> 01:31:44,550
I'm not making this up.
This is.

2237
01:31:44,551 --> 01:31:47,430
This is all freedom of information stuff
and here's a quote,

2238
01:31:47,431 --> 01:31:52,431
and this is the last thing I'm going to 
say on it because this is right out of 

2239
01:31:52,431 --> 01:31:55,161
Bill Clinton's book.
Bill Clinton wrote this just a month 

2240
01:31:55,161 --> 01:31:59,511
before apollo 11 astronauts buzz Aldrin 
and Neil Armstrong had left their 

2241
01:31:59,511 --> 01:31:59,530
colleague,
Michael Collins,

2242
01:31:59,531 --> 01:32:01,210
a board spaceship,
Columbia,

2243
01:32:01,211 --> 01:32:03,850
and walked on the moon beating by five 
months.

2244
01:32:03,940 --> 01:32:08,940
President Kennedy's goal of putting a 
man on the moon before the decade was 

2245
01:32:08,940 --> 01:32:11,911
out.
The old carpenter asked me if I really 

2246
01:32:11,911 --> 01:32:11,911
believed that happened.

2247
01:32:11,911 --> 01:32:11,911
I said,
sure.

2248
01:32:11,911 --> 01:32:13,630
I saw it on television.
He disagreed.

2249
01:32:13,780 --> 01:32:18,780
He said that he didn't believe it for a 
minute that them television fellers 

2250
01:32:18,780 --> 01:32:20,290
could make things look real that weren't
back then.

2251
01:32:20,291 --> 01:32:23,860
I thought he was a crank during my eight
years in Washington.

2252
01:32:24,040 --> 01:32:27,850
I saw some things on tv that made me 
wonder if he wasn't ahead of his time,

2253
01:32:28,570 --> 01:32:31,630
that's bill fucking Clinton,
Bill Clinton,

2254
01:32:31,631 --> 01:32:33,430
but what does it mean?
Does it make me nothing?

2255
01:32:33,431 --> 01:32:36,790
It might mean that he's just saying that
that people are full of Shit you say,

2256
01:32:36,910 --> 01:32:39,550
or it might mean that he just questioned
the moon landing.

2257
01:32:40,030 --> 01:32:42,820
He just said that that guy might have 
been ahead of his time.

2258
01:32:43,000 --> 01:32:44,620
It is quite possible.
Look,

2259
01:32:44,621 --> 01:32:49,621
if you were the president and you found 
that people really didn't go to the 

2260
01:32:49,621 --> 01:32:49,621
moon,
you can't.

2261
01:32:49,621 --> 01:32:50,320
You can't tell.
You can't just come out and say that,

2262
01:32:50,321 --> 01:32:55,321
and this is about as as transparent as 
you can get by saying that we didn't go 

2263
01:32:55,541 --> 01:32:57,910
to the moon and putting it into love to 
ask them about that quote,

2264
01:32:57,940 --> 01:32:59,200
that Shit.

2265
01:32:59,380 --> 01:33:00,130
He would say,
who are you?

2266
01:33:00,140 --> 01:33:05,140
No one will ever ask him about that.
Somebody needs to just ask them about 

2267
01:33:05,140 --> 01:33:05,200
that one.
Who's ever going to get that chance?

2268
01:33:05,500 --> 01:33:08,590
I'm sure a lot of people now,
he's probably hanging out.

2269
01:33:08,620 --> 01:33:10,960
He's probably got a twitter.
This get asked those questions.

2270
01:33:11,310 --> 01:33:16,310
The most likely scenario is that the 
moon landings were real and that people 

2271
01:33:16,310 --> 01:33:17,950
look for conspiracy and everything and 
if you look close enough at anything,

2272
01:33:17,951 --> 01:33:19,930
you can start to convince yourself that 
it's a hoax.

2273
01:33:20,110 --> 01:33:25,110
That is absolutely possible.
It's also possible they faked the whole 

2274
01:33:25,110 --> 01:33:29,221
fucking thing.
It is possible that they murdered Gus 

2275
01:33:29,221 --> 01:33:32,340
Grissom,
who was the guy that was a fucking 

2276
01:33:32,340 --> 01:33:33,391
astronaut and the Apollo one.
He was the guy that died in the 

2277
01:33:33,391 --> 01:33:35,881
simulator,
burned to death with two other people 

2278
01:33:35,881 --> 01:33:37,561
like I was questioning whether or not 
they're going to be able to get to it 

2279
01:33:37,561 --> 01:33:37,561
left and right.

2280
01:33:37,561 --> 01:33:40,770
He actually hung a lemon on the 
simulator and when he was doing 

2281
01:33:40,770 --> 01:33:41,530
interviews with reporters to tell people
that this is a lemon and this is.

2282
01:33:41,531 --> 01:33:44,050
They can't even communicate with this 
fucking tower that's a,

2283
01:33:44,051 --> 01:33:46,090
you know,
a half a mile away.

2284
01:33:46,270 --> 01:33:51,270
He goes,
how the fuck are we going to talk to 

2285
01:33:51,270 --> 01:33:51,270
people when we're on the moon?
Two hundred 60,000

2286
01:33:51,270 --> 01:33:51,270
miles away.
That guy died.

2287
01:33:51,270 --> 01:33:52,690
Okay.
And his family to this day,

2288
01:33:52,840 --> 01:33:54,280
I mean,
maybe it's just his son,

2289
01:33:54,400 --> 01:33:59,400
you know,
mrs his daddy and believes in 

2290
01:33:59,400 --> 01:33:59,400
conspiracies to,
but they believe that NASA murdered him.

2291
01:33:59,400 --> 01:34:02,140
There was also a guy and his name was 
Thomas Thomas,

2292
01:34:02,141 --> 01:34:04,030
Ronald Baron,
and he was hired by Congress.

2293
01:34:04,210 --> 01:34:07,270
He was a safety inspector.
He was hired by Congress to oversee NASA

2294
01:34:07,390 --> 01:34:10,420
and look at the whole moon landing thing
and z.

2295
01:34:10,421 --> 01:34:11,620
whether or not it's feasible.
Well,

2296
01:34:11,621 --> 01:34:16,621
this guy put together this 500 page 
report and he questioned whether or not 

2297
01:34:16,621 --> 01:34:16,990
they were ever going to get to the moon.

2298
01:34:16,990 --> 01:34:21,990
He said NASA was in such complete 
disarray that he didn't think there was 

2299
01:34:21,990 --> 01:34:23,230
ever gonna be able to do it.
That guy died a couple,

2300
01:34:23,231 --> 01:34:26,650
I don't remember how long afterwards.
It was very close afterwards in his car,

2301
01:34:26,651 --> 01:34:29,000
parked on a train track with his whole 
family.

2302
01:34:29,010 --> 01:34:32,920
He parked his car and a train track and 
died when the train hit the car.

2303
01:34:32,950 --> 01:34:33,720
Really?
Yeah.

2304
01:34:33,730 --> 01:34:36,580
Which is by the way,
how they got rid of people in 1969 folks

2305
01:34:37,770 --> 01:34:39,460
killed Kennedy.
They can kill you too,

2306
01:34:39,640 --> 01:34:44,640
and if you think you're going to go 
around undermining NASA is fake mission 

2307
01:34:44,640 --> 01:34:44,640
to the moon.
Well guess what?

2308
01:34:44,640 --> 01:34:49,261
We're going to park your car on a train 
track and you know you're going to 

2309
01:34:49,261 --> 01:34:49,261
disappear and so is your little report 
and Oh look,

2310
01:34:49,261 --> 01:34:50,380
we're on the moon.
Crazy.

2311
01:34:50,850 --> 01:34:52,960
What is it?
Who the fuck knows?

2312
01:34:53,020 --> 01:34:54,520
I don't know.
None of us do.

2313
01:34:54,670 --> 01:34:59,670
I'm certainly not claiming to be the 
possessor of some truth and all I'm 

2314
01:34:59,670 --> 01:35:02,150
saying is it is possible.
They could have pulled it off.

2315
01:35:02,180 --> 01:35:05,540
I firmly believed that with the insane 
budget they had operating,

2316
01:35:05,600 --> 01:35:08,150
they could have pulled off almost 
anything short of faking Godzilla.

2317
01:35:08,151 --> 01:35:11,420
Getting a attacking Tokes you see that 
movie wag the dog?

2318
01:35:11,870 --> 01:35:12,730
Yes.
Yeah.

2319
01:35:12,870 --> 01:35:15,530
It's like fascinated.
Just came up with on the fly.

2320
01:35:15,560 --> 01:35:20,560
It was like with on the fly how 
Hoffman's character just was like all 

2321
01:35:20,910 --> 01:35:25,910
and then we'll do this.
We'll bring in this guy and then will 

2322
01:35:25,910 --> 01:35:25,910
cast this guy and that's a brilliant 
move.

2323
01:35:25,910 --> 01:35:27,350
That was a really.
That is what they could do.

2324
01:35:27,370 --> 01:35:29,240
You know,
look who the fuck knows?

2325
01:35:29,241 --> 01:35:30,230
I know.
It's a retard.

2326
01:35:30,260 --> 01:35:32,330
I am not married to this.
I swear to God I'm not.

2327
01:35:32,331 --> 01:35:34,940
I had two arguments on,
on the air,

2328
01:35:34,941 --> 01:35:39,941
on the Penn and teller show and Penn 
Jillette rather pendulums radio show 

2329
01:35:39,941 --> 01:35:39,941
with this Guy Phil plait.

2330
01:35:39,941 --> 01:35:41,310
Great Guy who's a,
uh,

2331
01:35:41,420 --> 01:35:45,560
an he runs bad astronomy.com.
And I debated him about it,

2332
01:35:45,860 --> 01:35:50,860
you know,
and I thought he was going to clown me 

2333
01:35:50,860 --> 01:35:51,620
and he kind of did in some ways in the 
first one because he was,

2334
01:35:51,640 --> 01:35:56,640
he kind of corrected me on some things 
and maybe like really kind of see where 

2335
01:35:56,640 --> 01:35:59,951
he was coming from.
But also he was not willing to look at 

2336
01:35:59,951 --> 01:36:02,861
the possibility that was fake.
I said you have to look at things from 

2337
01:36:02,861 --> 01:36:03,620
both sides before you form a and a 
belief in it.

2338
01:36:03,820 --> 01:36:05,050
You have to,
you have to,

2339
01:36:05,210 --> 01:36:08,000
you have to look at it from both sides 
before you choose what side you believe.

2340
01:36:08,030 --> 01:36:13,030
Yeah.
But he's always going to believe in the 

2341
01:36:13,030 --> 01:36:14,741
side of science.
He's a scientist and he's an astronomer 

2342
01:36:14,741 --> 01:36:16,991
and it makes sense to me.
But when I was talking to him about 

2343
01:36:16,991 --> 01:36:16,991
certain things,
man,

2344
01:36:16,991 --> 01:36:20,180
one of them was,
they had some photos that they took the 

2345
01:36:20,180 --> 01:36:23,351
clementine lunar orbiter and they took 
these photos of the launch sites and 

2346
01:36:23,351 --> 01:36:26,900
they had these little specks that were 
on the ground and they said that this is

2347
01:36:26,901 --> 01:36:31,901
a,
this is like infrared photos from 330 

2348
01:36:31,901 --> 01:36:31,901
miles up or whatever.

2349
01:36:31,901 --> 01:36:33,350
The fuck it was 300 miles out,
whatever those satellite is,

2350
01:36:33,410 --> 01:36:38,410
how far away it is from the moon and 
that these are photos and they showed 

2351
01:36:38,410 --> 01:36:41,801
the landing site because it's like a 
blast crater from when the thing took 

2352
01:36:41,801 --> 01:36:44,771
off and I'm like,
how is that possible that you are 

2353
01:36:44,771 --> 01:36:49,091
accepting that that is the photo of the 
launch site when if you look at the 

2354
01:36:49,091 --> 01:36:50,900
launch site and those high resolution 
closeup photos,

2355
01:36:51,080 --> 01:36:56,080
there's no disturbance whatsoever.
There was one of the things that like 

2356
01:36:56,080 --> 01:36:56,080
all the posters,
all the,

2357
01:36:56,080 --> 01:36:56,480
you know,
the people that think it's a hoax,

2358
01:36:56,570 --> 01:36:58,400
that's what they always point to that 
this 10,000

2359
01:36:58,401 --> 01:37:01,400
pounds of thrust would have blasted a 
fucking hole in the ground.

2360
01:37:01,490 --> 01:37:03,260
But meanwhile when they landed there was
like.

2361
01:37:03,290 --> 01:37:08,290
It was totally undisturbed.
Like how are you going to get crystal 

2362
01:37:08,290 --> 01:37:08,290
clear?
Close Up,

2363
01:37:08,290 --> 01:37:09,140
high resolution photos that show no 
disturbance,

2364
01:37:09,350 --> 01:37:14,350
but you're,
you're going to be able to see it from 

2365
01:37:14,350 --> 01:37:14,350
orbit miles above the earth.

2366
01:37:14,350 --> 01:37:16,400
You're gonna be able to see this little 
tiny dot from 300 miles up.

2367
01:37:16,460 --> 01:37:19,940
That's craziness and he didn't have 
anything to say to that.

2368
01:37:20,160 --> 01:37:21,620
I was like,
you never considered that.

2369
01:37:21,800 --> 01:37:23,480
You never looked at these little craters
and said,

2370
01:37:23,481 --> 01:37:25,760
how does that make sense?
How is that possible?

2371
01:37:26,210 --> 01:37:30,260
How many people are still around?
That had been on the is quite a few.

2372
01:37:30,290 --> 01:37:31,460
There's quite a few.
There's a bunch,

2373
01:37:31,480 --> 01:37:33,140
you know,
there are whole squirrely man.

2374
01:37:34,130 --> 01:37:35,430
Buzz Aldrin,
you know,

2375
01:37:35,610 --> 01:37:40,610
is this fascinating interviews with him 
and his fascinating and one of them 

2376
01:37:40,610 --> 01:37:42,130
where this guy who runs,
he's got he,

2377
01:37:42,200 --> 01:37:47,200
he made the movie of a funny thing 
happened on the way to the moon and he 

2378
01:37:47,200 --> 01:37:47,810
told,
tells buzz Aldrin he's a liar,

2379
01:37:47,811 --> 01:37:49,480
and Buzz Aldrin punches him in the head.
Oh you.

2380
01:37:49,490 --> 01:37:51,410
Which by the way,
rightly so.

2381
01:37:51,411 --> 01:37:56,411
Fuck you man.
Even if the guy did fucking fake the 

2382
01:37:56,411 --> 01:37:56,411
moon landing,
what do you think his idea.

2383
01:37:56,610 --> 01:37:58,290
You know,
you don't think he got talked into doing

2384
01:37:58,291 --> 01:37:59,610
that.
You don't think that maybe they had some

2385
01:37:59,611 --> 01:38:02,340
fucking guns to his head.
Maybe they scared the shit out of him.

2386
01:38:02,341 --> 01:38:05,340
He became a massive alcoholic after he 
came back from the moon landings.

2387
01:38:05,760 --> 01:38:07,040
One of the weirdest thing about the 
moon.

2388
01:38:07,041 --> 01:38:09,540
Then it says you have to watch the post 
flight press conference.

2389
01:38:10,380 --> 01:38:14,820
I am no science expert,
but I am an expert in bullshit.

2390
01:38:15,060 --> 01:38:18,060
I know when people are lying.
I can fucking see it.

2391
01:38:18,090 --> 01:38:19,740
I can smell it.
And you can too.

2392
01:38:19,860 --> 01:38:24,860
There's a weird thing with humans where 
we can tell when people are being 

2393
01:38:24,860 --> 01:38:26,700
deceptive and these the video with them 
coming back from the moon,

2394
01:38:26,701 --> 01:38:28,500
man,
it seems like they're full of shit.

2395
01:38:28,770 --> 01:38:31,590
It doesn't seem like they're nervous.
They're definitely nervous too,

2396
01:38:31,740 --> 01:38:33,420
but it also seems like they're full of 
shit.

2397
01:38:33,690 --> 01:38:36,270
Buzz Aldrin and Michael Collins,
they're just shitty actors.

2398
01:38:36,300 --> 01:38:41,300
Was it a.
was it like an open press conference 

2399
01:38:41,300 --> 01:38:41,300
where the core could.
One of them,

2400
01:38:41,300 --> 01:38:42,930
they.
They asked them what was it like?

2401
01:38:42,931 --> 01:38:44,230
Did you see any stars when you're on the
moon?

2402
01:38:44,231 --> 01:38:49,231
And Michael Collins says,
I don't recall seeing any stars when I 

2403
01:38:49,231 --> 01:38:49,231
was on the moon.
I don't recall seeing it,

2404
01:38:49,231 --> 01:38:53,160
but meanwhile that's never left the 
command module in the story.

2405
01:38:53,340 --> 01:38:57,240
The narrative is that Buzz Aldrin and 
Neil Armstrong made it to the moon,

2406
01:38:57,241 --> 01:38:59,670
but Michael Collins State in orbit,
he never went on the moon,

2407
01:39:00,120 --> 01:39:04,290
so they attributed that quote to buzz 
Aldrin in the transcript because Michael

2408
01:39:04,290 --> 01:39:05,550
Collins would never,
never say it.

2409
01:39:05,880 --> 01:39:08,180
It's it's all conspiratory talk.
Yeah,

2410
01:39:08,220 --> 01:39:08,820
no,
it is,

2411
01:39:09,000 --> 01:39:11,790
but there's enough shit there that makes
me go.

2412
01:39:11,791 --> 01:39:15,600
I'm not willing to totally buy this.
I know it sounds ridiculous.

2413
01:39:15,720 --> 01:39:18,690
I know the arguments that the outcomes 
razor man,

2414
01:39:18,810 --> 01:39:23,810
most likely scenario,
you have to go with that when the most 

2415
01:39:23,810 --> 01:39:24,810
likely scenario is that we can't do it 
anymore because of budgetary reasons and

2416
01:39:24,811 --> 01:39:29,811
this and that,
but there's never been a single 

2417
01:39:29,811 --> 01:39:30,080
technological achievement from 1969.

2418
01:39:30,080 --> 01:39:35,080
It's not cheaper,
easier or faster to reproduce today 

2419
01:39:35,080 --> 01:39:37,200
except for putting people on the moon.
That one is weird.

2420
01:39:37,440 --> 01:39:42,440
That one.
Every time they talk about putting 

2421
01:39:42,440 --> 01:39:42,440
people back,
it's 20,

2422
01:39:42,440 --> 01:39:42,440
20 or 20,
22,

2423
01:39:42,440 --> 01:39:44,070
but every president says they're going 
to do it.

2424
01:39:44,280 --> 01:39:46,290
George Herbert Walker Bush that he was 
going to do it.

2425
01:39:46,291 --> 01:39:48,990
Bill Clinton said he was going to do it.
George Bush said he was going to.

2426
01:39:48,991 --> 01:39:51,060
They all talked about putting people 
back in the moon.

2427
01:39:51,150 --> 01:39:53,580
Could you imagine Barack Obama?
We'd be like,

2428
01:39:53,581 --> 01:39:56,580
we have enough problems right?
Fucking here.

2429
01:39:56,690 --> 01:39:59,280
Yeah.
This is not the time to also do this.

2430
01:39:59,310 --> 01:40:01,350
It's also not the time to invade 
Pakistan,

2431
01:40:01,360 --> 01:40:06,360
so he can't be in Afghanistan.
It's a time to be concentrating on our 

2432
01:40:06,360 --> 01:40:07,410
own economies.
Going to that scary shit,

2433
01:40:07,411 --> 01:40:08,880
man.
All of it's scary

2434
01:40:09,270 --> 01:40:14,270
San thing is because you know,
if you start with them then that cuts 

2435
01:40:14,270 --> 01:40:18,050
off all support to Afghanistan and it's 
like now,

2436
01:40:18,110 --> 01:40:19,050
now it's game on on.

2437
01:40:19,120 --> 01:40:23,800
You want to fight three fucking pro.
You want to have rewards at one time.

2438
01:40:23,860 --> 01:40:25,620
And by the way,
that's when I ran his,

2439
01:40:25,621 --> 01:40:27,370
uh,
his comes into the picture too,

2440
01:40:27,670 --> 01:40:29,460
wouldn't mean there's,
there's all this talk about evading.

2441
01:40:29,461 --> 01:40:30,520
I ran,
what if I ran,

2442
01:40:30,521 --> 01:40:35,521
you know,
keeps up its military program or its 

2443
01:40:35,521 --> 01:40:35,521
nuclear program rather.
And then we have to invade Iran.

2444
01:40:35,521 --> 01:40:35,830
Yeah.
Yeah.

2445
01:40:36,010 --> 01:40:36,660
I don't know,
man.

2446
01:40:36,690 --> 01:40:41,690
It's still.
My point about all this is that we don't

2447
01:40:41,951 --> 01:40:46,951
know what the fuck the people who are 
quote unquote running this world are 

2448
01:40:46,951 --> 01:40:48,940
doing.
We don't know what they're doing.

2449
01:40:49,000 --> 01:40:52,720
We assume that what they're telling us 
is what's really going on,

2450
01:40:52,930 --> 01:40:57,930
but they've been proven over and over 
again throughout history to be full of 

2451
01:40:57,930 --> 01:40:59,140
Shit and they've even said they're going
to be full of shit to protect us.

2452
01:40:59,230 --> 01:41:01,000
They've said that the CIA has come out.

2453
01:41:01,210 --> 01:41:06,210
It was mainstream news reported that 
they were going to start making 

2454
01:41:06,210 --> 01:41:07,570
artificial stories and putting them in 
the news to throw off the terrorists.

2455
01:41:08,050 --> 01:41:09,310
Well,
when you start doing that,

2456
01:41:09,311 --> 01:41:10,600
man,
all bets are off.

2457
01:41:10,960 --> 01:41:15,960
You know,
you start lying to everybody to protect 

2458
01:41:15,960 --> 01:41:15,960
us like Jesus fucking Christ.
Where's the accountability?

2459
01:41:15,960 --> 01:41:16,720
Where at?
When?

2460
01:41:16,721 --> 01:41:18,180
When does this stop?
You know,

2461
01:41:18,190 --> 01:41:21,880
why are we angry at the world?
Why is the world angry at us?

2462
01:41:22,000 --> 01:41:25,630
Why are we there yet?
Does it really have to be micromanaged?

2463
01:41:25,660 --> 01:41:30,660
Do we really have to manage all the 
people in the world and keep everybody 

2464
01:41:30,660 --> 01:41:31,120
under our thumb?
Are you sure?

2465
01:41:31,121 --> 01:41:32,890
Is it just because we've been doing it 
forever?

2466
01:41:33,250 --> 01:41:33,520
I mean,
is,

2467
01:41:33,521 --> 01:41:35,950
is there a better way to approach this?

2468
01:41:36,570 --> 01:41:36,950
I,
I,

2469
01:41:39,020 --> 01:41:44,020
I just feel like right now with what is 
happening here and the sentiment that 

2470
01:41:44,631 --> 01:41:48,140
people feel about what's going on over 
in the Middle East and they're taking,

2471
01:41:48,280 --> 01:41:50,060
not that they're taken care of the 
business on their own,

2472
01:41:50,061 --> 01:41:54,390
but you see things starting to play out 
where even in Egypt it's like they're,

2473
01:41:54,400 --> 01:41:59,390
they're handling the uprisings are 
happening and if they're not perfect,

2474
01:41:59,391 --> 01:42:04,391
but things are getting sorted out on 
their own and for us to be there 

2475
01:42:04,391 --> 01:42:06,140
interfering or being the catalyst for 
those kinds of things that happen is not

2476
01:42:06,141 --> 01:42:08,400
a good idea.
Well I have these uprisings,

2477
01:42:08,540 --> 01:42:13,540
you're knocking at the fucking Hornets 
nest rather than just letting it be and 

2478
01:42:13,540 --> 01:42:16,040
letting them take care of themselves or 
take care of the situations that they're

2479
01:42:16,041 --> 01:42:17,540
not happy about themselves.

2480
01:42:17,750 --> 01:42:18,650
Yeah,
but what gets.

2481
01:42:18,680 --> 01:42:23,680
You got to kind of keep dictators from 
rising up and just fucking up people 

2482
01:42:23,680 --> 01:42:24,740
too.
It's like because also when you get it,

2483
01:42:24,770 --> 01:42:26,110
but we don't do that.
We don't do,

2484
01:42:26,160 --> 01:42:27,920
we do it.
We do it when it's,

2485
01:42:27,970 --> 01:42:30,590
but when there are allies or there are 
friends,

2486
01:42:30,930 --> 01:42:32,120
then we're,
then it's cool.

2487
01:42:32,130 --> 01:42:33,830
Then this is the guy that runs the 
thing.

2488
01:42:33,840 --> 01:42:35,960
I know there's problems,
but there's always been problems.

2489
01:42:36,230 --> 01:42:37,160
He's our friend.
Wait,

2490
01:42:37,190 --> 01:42:38,990
he's not our friend.
Fucking let's go.

2491
01:42:39,020 --> 01:42:41,090
Everyone in get them in.
We got to get them out.

2492
01:42:41,091 --> 01:42:42,740
We got to get the next guy we can trust 
in there.

2493
01:42:42,790 --> 01:42:43,880
Right?
Like Egypt.

2494
01:42:43,940 --> 01:42:45,230
Exactly.
Yeah.

2495
01:42:45,300 --> 01:42:50,300
He moved,
moved and that's my fear about about 

2496
01:42:50,300 --> 01:42:50,300
Pakistan now it's like we've been giving
one,

2497
01:42:50,300 --> 01:42:55,240
one and a half billion dollars a year 
for arms and it's like now wait a 

2498
01:42:55,240 --> 01:42:55,240
second.
You've,

2499
01:42:55,240 --> 01:42:58,550
you've had this guy for five fucking 
years.

2500
01:42:58,551 --> 01:43:03,551
He's lived in this house five or 800 
yards away from a military base.

2501
01:43:05,480 --> 01:43:09,140
You gotta be fucking kidding me man.
At some point like,

2502
01:43:09,410 --> 01:43:10,520
look,
I'm not a cop,

2503
01:43:10,521 --> 01:43:11,280
but I,
you got.

2504
01:43:11,300 --> 01:43:13,370
I mean you could.
You didn't know that was in your yard?

2505
01:43:13,371 --> 01:43:17,960
No Sir.
Did you guys not know was either.

2506
01:43:17,961 --> 01:43:19,240
Did you hear about that?
Really?

2507
01:43:19,280 --> 01:43:21,160
There was no dialysis machine.
I,

2508
01:43:21,170 --> 01:43:22,290
that's what I read,
but there's,

2509
01:43:22,490 --> 01:43:27,490
it's like,
that's another thing we were told about 

2510
01:43:27,490 --> 01:43:27,590
like the dialysis thing and that he's,
he was almost an invalid,

2511
01:43:27,591 --> 01:43:32,591
you know,
and it's like this guy was fucking 

2512
01:43:32,591 --> 01:43:34,580
roaming around this house for five years
and nobody picked up on this.

2513
01:43:34,670 --> 01:43:36,950
Yeah,
it's a very fantastic story.

2514
01:43:37,070 --> 01:43:42,070
And we talked about this yesterday and 
we said that if you had a movie and in 

2515
01:43:42,070 --> 01:43:44,981
the movie you wanted to have an ending 
where it could leave room for the 

2516
01:43:44,981 --> 01:43:44,981
sequel.
This is the perfect ending.

2517
01:43:44,981 --> 01:43:47,840
You don't get to see the body as they 
double and the ocean,

2518
01:43:47,960 --> 01:43:49,820
you know,
Fuck van.

2519
01:43:50,030 --> 01:43:50,660
It's like,
it's,

2520
01:43:50,910 --> 01:43:55,040
it's almost like they want people to,
even if they did have photos of him now,

2521
01:43:55,041 --> 01:43:57,230
let them fucking gas and keep things 
interesting.

2522
01:43:57,590 --> 01:43:59,630
Keeps things humming along and keeps 
people.

2523
01:44:02,330 --> 01:44:04,410
Saddam,
you showed him die.

2524
01:44:04,800 --> 01:44:06,640
They didn't just show you this video.
Why can't,

2525
01:44:06,810 --> 01:44:11,810
why can't we have a little.
They showed Rashawn Rondo's arm 

2526
01:44:11,810 --> 01:44:13,980
dislocated a thousand times on the news 
that night and it was horrible.

2527
01:44:13,981 --> 01:44:16,530
Look at,
we can see a fucking photo of,

2528
01:44:16,650 --> 01:44:18,990
you know,
it's sort of like we fought this,

2529
01:44:18,991 --> 01:44:23,991
we've paid for this war for 10 years.
We've had so much fucking problems 

2530
01:44:23,991 --> 01:44:25,020
financially here.
We send troops over there,

2531
01:44:25,021 --> 01:44:28,180
they've let us see the fucking photo.
We can see the arguments

2532
01:44:28,350 --> 01:44:33,350
not showing it.
I could see that it's going to make him 

2533
01:44:33,350 --> 01:44:33,350
a martyr.
I could see that.

2534
01:44:33,350 --> 01:44:33,350
It's gonna make people,
you know,

2535
01:44:33,350 --> 01:44:35,680
in the militant movement,
Islamic militant movement,

2536
01:44:35,880 --> 01:44:38,140
you know they're going to use that as 
propaganda.

2537
01:44:38,200 --> 01:44:43,200
I can see that.
It's better to not show it when you're 

2538
01:44:43,200 --> 01:44:43,200
dealing with religious fanatics.
It's better to just.

2539
01:44:43,200 --> 01:44:44,230
If you really did have it.
Yeah.

2540
01:44:44,260 --> 01:44:49,260
Jumping in the ocean or the upper gun 
ice where everybody can be the next 

2541
01:44:49,260 --> 01:44:50,020
president.
Come check it out.

2542
01:44:50,950 --> 01:44:53,070
Not The high road,
the high road.

2543
01:44:53,071 --> 01:44:54,330
You're right,
it is the high road,

2544
01:44:54,360 --> 01:44:55,760
but I don't really know.
I don't know.

2545
01:44:55,810 --> 01:44:58,060
We're even the high road.
I don't even think it's the high road.

2546
01:44:58,130 --> 01:44:59,800
I mean,
I just think it's the smart road.

2547
01:44:59,890 --> 01:45:04,260
I think if you look at as far as benefit
to to,

2548
01:45:04,290 --> 01:45:06,850
you know,
to a negative repercussions,

2549
01:45:07,030 --> 01:45:12,030
you would have to say that the benefit 
would be would lie in not stirring up 

2550
01:45:12,030 --> 01:45:15,901
more than possible.
If you've already killed the guy and 

2551
01:45:15,901 --> 01:45:15,901
you've got the,
you know,

2552
01:45:15,901 --> 01:45:17,140
you did the work,
you did what the public wants you to do.

2553
01:45:17,141 --> 01:45:19,480
You got rid of public enemy number one.
He got rid of this guy.

2554
01:45:19,481 --> 01:45:24,481
He got his computers.
If that really happened the way they 

2555
01:45:24,481 --> 01:45:24,481
said it happened.
Yeah.

2556
01:45:24,481 --> 01:45:24,481
What the fuck,
man.

2557
01:45:24,481 --> 01:45:24,600
You don't have to show people the 
pictures.

2558
01:45:24,601 --> 01:45:25,040
You,
you're,

2559
01:45:25,041 --> 01:45:26,680
you're protecting people.
You did your job.

2560
01:45:26,800 --> 01:45:29,890
If everybody is secure and all the 
people who are important.

2561
01:45:29,891 --> 01:45:31,280
I've seen the photos.
Yeah.

2562
01:45:31,281 --> 01:45:32,630
I mean I don't think we all need to see 
it.

2563
01:45:32,631 --> 01:45:34,360
I don't think it needs to be destroyed 
about this.

2564
01:45:34,361 --> 01:45:35,530
What if they said,
it sounds to me that.

2565
01:45:35,531 --> 01:45:37,030
I don't want to say it's on this 
website.

2566
01:45:37,031 --> 01:45:38,110
If you want to look at it,
great.

2567
01:45:38,111 --> 01:45:39,250
If you don't,
you don't know.

2568
01:45:39,251 --> 01:45:44,251
That's not good because then the Islamic
terrorists are gonna be able to look at 

2569
01:45:44,251 --> 01:45:47,071
it.
They're going to look at it and they're 

2570
01:45:47,071 --> 01:45:48,270
going to go fucking crazy and areas and 
strap themselves up with it.

2571
01:45:48,810 --> 01:45:53,780
Domain Password.
Can't fucking get a hacker again.

2572
01:45:54,050 --> 01:45:57,750
It's password protected months or a year
and then a hacker's going to somehow

2573
01:45:58,000 --> 01:46:00,570
dot sal's computer that has it or do 
something there.

2574
01:46:00,571 --> 01:46:03,140
There's gonna be a Wiki.
Maybe if this happened 10 years ago,

2575
01:46:03,141 --> 01:46:06,590
I would say definitely,
but I think now I think probably not.

2576
01:46:06,591 --> 01:46:11,591
I think now they're probably pretty good
at stopping shit like that from 

2577
01:46:11,591 --> 01:46:11,591
happening.
If it's all legit,

2578
01:46:11,591 --> 01:46:13,880
is it the Pentagon just hacked like 
couple months ago.

2579
01:46:14,230 --> 01:46:17,840
We had Brian Callen on yesterday and I 
love Brian take on things because it's a

2580
01:46:17,900 --> 01:46:19,040
very Fox News.
Like,

2581
01:46:19,340 --> 01:46:21,110
yeah,
he's,

2582
01:46:21,140 --> 01:46:21,710
he's,
he's,

2583
01:46:21,711 --> 01:46:22,220
uh,
you know,

2584
01:46:22,450 --> 01:46:24,530
but the way he grew up and you know,
he's very,

2585
01:46:24,770 --> 01:46:29,210
he believes that they're doing the right
things and he believes that whatever,

2586
01:46:29,211 --> 01:46:29,880
you know,
the,

2587
01:46:30,010 --> 01:46:35,010
the narrative is that he follows 
whatever because the reason why we're 

2588
01:46:35,010 --> 01:46:37,490
there in certain places and he doesn't 
believe in conspiracies,

2589
01:46:37,760 --> 01:46:42,760
but you know,
when you look at all the different 

2590
01:46:42,760 --> 01:46:42,760
goddamn stores like Pat Tillman,
you know,

2591
01:46:42,760 --> 01:46:46,480
how they tried to change that fucking 
story and butcher that when he was 

2592
01:46:46,480 --> 01:46:47,510
killed by friendly fire and the Jessica 
Lynch story.

2593
01:46:47,510 --> 01:46:50,010
And these are just the ones that have up
in our faces.

2594
01:46:50,011 --> 01:46:51,450
How many of these have they got away 
with?

2595
01:46:51,660 --> 01:46:56,660
How many,
how many stories that we think are 

2596
01:46:56,660 --> 01:46:56,660
history or just total complete horse 
shit.

2597
01:46:56,660 --> 01:46:57,240
You know,
there's a lot,

2598
01:46:57,360 --> 01:46:58,830
a lot.
There's a fuckload man,

2599
01:46:59,310 --> 01:47:00,690
there's a,
you know,

2600
01:47:00,810 --> 01:47:04,050
I just,
you gotta be crazy to believe everything

2601
01:47:04,051 --> 01:47:09,051
they say.
I'm not saying that you should believe 

2602
01:47:09,051 --> 01:47:09,051
in conspiracy theories because a lot of 
them are just as nuts.

2603
01:47:09,051 --> 01:47:13,970
And by the way,
some of the really naughty conspiracy 

2604
01:47:13,970 --> 01:47:14,160
theories,
Garol fucking t,

2605
01:47:14,310 --> 01:47:17,850
those are put in place by the government
to discredit conspiracy theories.

2606
01:47:18,030 --> 01:47:18,570
It's,
that's,

2607
01:47:18,571 --> 01:47:21,240
that's a tactic that's been used from 
the beginning of time.

2608
01:47:21,810 --> 01:47:26,810
That's what they do.
It's just information because she put 

2609
01:47:26,810 --> 01:47:29,960
out disinformation,
they'll give you a bunch of good 

2610
01:47:29,960 --> 01:47:29,960
information,
a bunch of things that make sense.

2611
01:47:29,960 --> 01:47:33,700
Like they'll say that Lee Harvey Oswald 
did not act alone and you know,

2612
01:47:33,810 --> 01:47:38,810
he thought that he was doing this,
but they had set him up and they really 

2613
01:47:38,810 --> 01:47:42,681
shot Kennedy with assassins that were 
set up in different parts of the grassy 

2614
01:47:42,681 --> 01:47:43,110
knoll and all throughout Dallas,
Texas.

2615
01:47:43,260 --> 01:47:48,260
And the reason why they used Lee Harvey 
Oswald's because they needed him to die 

2616
01:47:48,260 --> 01:47:52,040
so that he could go through a wormhole 
to Alpha Centauri to bring back the 

2617
01:47:52,040 --> 01:47:55,540
master and the master is going to reach.
All they have to do is that.

2618
01:47:55,620 --> 01:47:59,150
And then all sudden that'll all the Lee 
Harvey Oswald stuff is shit.

2619
01:47:59,180 --> 01:48:03,180
And now you're getting people like you 
can't say Lee Harvey Oswald because then

2620
01:48:03,240 --> 01:48:06,600
you get to go to fucking sell somewhere.
It's like Tom,

2621
01:48:06,690 --> 01:48:10,140
try talking about Ufos,
tried talking about aliens,

2622
01:48:10,141 --> 01:48:12,210
try talking about you know,
any,

2623
01:48:12,211 --> 01:48:16,170
anything along those lines and you 
automatically get labeled a Kook,

2624
01:48:16,171 --> 01:48:18,510
tried talking about big foot,
you're a fucking Kook.

2625
01:48:18,810 --> 01:48:21,840
But meanwhile bigfoot might have very 
well existed.

2626
01:48:21,841 --> 01:48:23,820
There's an animal called a gigantic 
pythagoreous.

2627
01:48:24,000 --> 01:48:29,000
It's a fucking huge eight foot tall 
erect ape that lived in Asia and might 

2628
01:48:29,000 --> 01:48:30,660
very well have come across the bering 
strait.

2629
01:48:30,810 --> 01:48:32,130
Is it still alive now?

2630
01:48:32,190 --> 01:48:37,190
Probably not,
but might have existed at one point in 

2631
01:48:37,190 --> 01:48:37,190
time.
It's,

2632
01:48:37,190 --> 01:48:37,190
it's a real animal.
It's,

2633
01:48:37,200 --> 01:48:42,200
you know,
they know what they think it might be 

2634
01:48:42,200 --> 01:48:44,630
and it looks like big foot.
So it did exist and it existed just 

2635
01:48:44,630 --> 01:48:45,180
100,000
years or so ago.

2636
01:48:45,270 --> 01:48:47,610
And there's been many,
many instances of shit that they thought

2637
01:48:47,611 --> 01:48:49,320
was the long dead.
Like the Coelacanth.

2638
01:48:49,500 --> 01:48:52,080
There was a fish that's a god damn 
prehistoric monster.

2639
01:48:52,081 --> 01:48:54,810
It's a fucking dinosaur.
Hundreds of millions of years old.

2640
01:48:55,020 --> 01:48:57,270
They thought this thing was long extinct
until,

2641
01:48:57,271 --> 01:49:00,540
I believe it was in 1930.
Someone caught one and they're like,

2642
01:49:00,541 --> 01:49:02,130
whoa,
these are alive.

2643
01:49:02,580 --> 01:49:03,930
They're alive.
They're in the ocean.

2644
01:49:03,960 --> 01:49:06,150
Who the fuck knows what's in the Pacific
northwest?

2645
01:49:06,210 --> 01:49:08,290
Fly over that shit in an airplane.
I know.

2646
01:49:08,560 --> 01:49:13,560
I was just up in Kirkland,
Washington last weekend or two weekends 

2647
01:49:13,560 --> 01:49:13,560
ago.
Fucking crazy up there.

2648
01:49:13,560 --> 01:49:14,940
Dense forest,
man.

2649
01:49:15,150 --> 01:49:17,490
You're talking about millions of acres.

2650
01:49:17,490 --> 01:49:22,490
Millions of square miles probably.
You know how many square and that's not 

2651
01:49:22,490 --> 01:49:22,490
true.
Thousands of square miles though.

2652
01:49:22,590 --> 01:49:24,200
What does this square miles a weird 
thing like?

2653
01:49:24,210 --> 01:49:25,530
There's a lot of footage in a square 
mile.

2654
01:49:25,531 --> 01:49:27,120
It's not like the distance between two 
points.

2655
01:49:27,121 --> 01:49:32,121
Yeah.
Well how do you do it on a hill or 

2656
01:49:32,121 --> 01:49:32,121
something?
Millions of acres for sure,

2657
01:49:32,121 --> 01:49:32,430
but whatever it is,
when you fly over it,

2658
01:49:32,431 --> 01:49:37,431
you look at the density of the Pacific 
northwest has legitimate rain forests 

2659
01:49:37,590 --> 01:49:42,590
where you can't see inside.
You don't know what the fuck is in 

2660
01:49:42,590 --> 01:49:42,590
there.
There's a lot of crazy shit in there.

2661
01:49:42,590 --> 01:49:44,370
Is there a big foot?
Probably not.

2662
01:49:44,430 --> 01:49:46,770
Probably not,
but I wouldn't be surprised if it is.

2663
01:49:47,230 --> 01:49:48,230
If they've caught bigfoot

2664
01:49:48,280 --> 01:49:48,910
though.
Really?

2665
01:49:48,911 --> 01:49:50,720
What is it?
It's just a big stupid monkey.

2666
01:49:50,730 --> 01:49:53,170
A who wouldn't be any different than an 
Orangutang.

2667
01:49:53,171 --> 01:49:57,890
It'd be cool if it had it dressed up in 
clothes.

2668
01:49:57,920 --> 01:49:58,830
If it was like,
oh,

2669
01:49:59,040 --> 01:50:01,600
you guys regulations had a little 
family.

2670
01:50:02,020 --> 01:50:03,960
Yeah,
big was divorced.

2671
01:50:04,290 --> 01:50:05,780
He's got two kids.
He doesn't see,

2672
01:50:05,980 --> 01:50:07,540
you know,
they didn't discover the mountain.

2673
01:50:07,541 --> 01:50:09,100
Gorilla and team till 19.
Oh,

2674
01:50:09,101 --> 01:50:10,730
two.
I just,

2675
01:50:10,770 --> 01:50:15,770
you know what?
I discovered the mountain gorilla three 

2676
01:50:15,770 --> 01:50:16,760
seconds ago with a giant ass fucking 
huge gorilla.

2677
01:50:17,520 --> 01:50:19,740
It's a big ass fucking gorilla.
I'm learned something.

2678
01:50:19,770 --> 01:50:22,450
My son loves dinosaurs.
He's two and a half.

2679
01:50:22,451 --> 01:50:25,930
So we went to the Museum of natural 
history in New York and just going like,

2680
01:50:25,931 --> 01:50:27,700
it's cool.
Like I haven't been to museums.

2681
01:50:27,720 --> 01:50:28,780
So I was a kid.
Really.

2682
01:50:28,800 --> 01:50:33,800
It's like going back now.
You actually care and you're learning 

2683
01:50:33,800 --> 01:50:33,800
more like watching him and I are 
together.

2684
01:50:33,800 --> 01:50:37,210
Like oh shit,
this is fucking like I looked at a t rex

2685
01:50:37,230 --> 01:50:40,540
is fucking massive.
It's massive.

2686
01:50:40,720 --> 01:50:45,720
Incredible.
The vertebrae on the t rex is bigger 

2687
01:50:45,720 --> 01:50:46,570
than my forearm.
You crazy?

2688
01:50:46,660 --> 01:50:49,090
Yeah.
And then they try to figure out what the

2689
01:50:49,091 --> 01:50:54,091
fuck,
how the why the t rex was built like 

2690
01:50:54,091 --> 01:50:54,091
that too.
There's so much speculation.

2691
01:50:54,091 --> 01:50:55,950
Like why this thing of these giant legs 
and these,

2692
01:50:55,980 --> 01:51:00,980
these little tiny arms and could it run,
could they think even run like how fast 

2693
01:51:00,980 --> 01:51:02,650
it gives you a little Jurassic Park they
ran,

2694
01:51:03,010 --> 01:51:08,010
they ran really fast.
But the speculation is that that's not 

2695
01:51:08,010 --> 01:51:11,011
possible.
And then there's other speculation by 

2696
01:51:11,011 --> 01:51:11,440
more fringe people that think that the 
atmosphere was different than that.

2697
01:51:11,441 --> 01:51:14,140
It was a much denser atmosphere that 
could carry your weight better.

2698
01:51:14,170 --> 01:51:15,790
The gravity was lighter or something.
Well,

2699
01:51:15,791 --> 01:51:17,220
I,
I also think they were unbelievable.

2700
01:51:17,410 --> 01:51:22,410
They never got off balance because their
tail wait almost as fresh as the front 

2701
01:51:22,410 --> 01:51:22,410
part.

2702
01:51:22,410 --> 01:51:24,010
So they were never.
They could just lock those legs down and

2703
01:51:24,011 --> 01:51:26,680
just move around and that you can really
get them off balance.

2704
01:51:26,710 --> 01:51:29,010
There's also speculation.
The t rex was just a,

2705
01:51:29,020 --> 01:51:34,020
um,
just a scavenger that those big teeth 

2706
01:51:34,020 --> 01:51:34,280
were just for breaking up bones and 
Sheila.

2707
01:51:34,310 --> 01:51:39,310
She was dying left and right all over 
the place and they would just find it 

2708
01:51:39,310 --> 01:51:39,800
like a garbage disposal.
Just eat whatever you can.

2709
01:51:40,020 --> 01:51:41,860
Raptors would kill something and they 
would,

2710
01:51:41,861 --> 01:51:42,580
uh,
they would just go,

2711
01:51:42,581 --> 01:51:43,270
get out of here,
bitch.

2712
01:51:43,271 --> 01:51:43,870
I said,
it's mine,

2713
01:51:43,900 --> 01:51:45,940
and then they would be big and ugly and 
then they,

2714
01:51:45,960 --> 01:51:50,960
they,
there's even speculation about their 

2715
01:51:50,960 --> 01:51:50,960
coloring that they're coloring would be 
very vulture,

2716
01:51:50,960 --> 01:51:52,420
like that's possible that they were like
really hideous looking.

2717
01:51:52,840 --> 01:51:56,740
They would just giant garbage disposals,
still fun to see like all the,

2718
01:51:57,370 --> 01:52:00,850
just the gigantic massive fucking bones 
they had and stuff.

2719
01:52:00,880 --> 01:52:02,560
It's crazy.
What people don't realize,

2720
01:52:02,561 --> 01:52:07,561
man,
is that if this mean that world that 

2721
01:52:07,561 --> 01:52:07,561
existed,
you know,

2722
01:52:07,561 --> 01:52:12,450
65 million years ago before that giant 
meteor hit and killed all those 

2723
01:52:12,450 --> 01:52:15,451
dinosaurs,
that world could easily be right now if 

2724
01:52:15,451 --> 01:52:15,451
that made your didn't hit and there'd be
no people,

2725
01:52:15,451 --> 01:52:16,180
no.
There would be nothing.

2726
01:52:16,360 --> 01:52:21,360
Those things like what the world that we
have now is one of several mass 

2727
01:52:21,360 --> 01:52:26,011
extinction event worlds.
There's been several different ones 

2728
01:52:26,011 --> 01:52:28,300
along the lines and this is the latest 
to survive the last mass extinction,

2729
01:52:28,480 --> 01:52:30,940
but they're all very different.
They're all very different.

2730
01:52:30,941 --> 01:52:33,030
It's very few animals that survive that.
This,

2731
01:52:33,100 --> 01:52:35,080
the,
the one that hit the Yucatan,

2732
01:52:35,290 --> 01:52:40,290
that they say it was five miles long and
that it was five miles deep into the 

2733
01:52:41,290 --> 01:52:43,030
earth in the first,
second and a half.

2734
01:52:43,031 --> 01:52:47,480
It hit really five miles in deep into 
the earth.

2735
01:52:47,480 --> 01:52:49,670
The second,
second and a half that it hit.

2736
01:52:49,970 --> 01:52:54,970
And that's not unusual.
That's happened a bunch of times over 

2737
01:52:54,970 --> 01:52:54,970
the course of the,
uh,

2738
01:52:54,970 --> 01:52:55,040
the,
the history of the earth.

2739
01:52:55,910 --> 01:52:56,350
Yeah.
Yeah,

2740
01:52:56,430 --> 01:52:57,500
I can.
It can happen man.

2741
01:52:57,501 --> 01:52:59,540
And there ain't shit to do about it.
Fuck Bruce Willis.

2742
01:52:59,541 --> 01:53:04,541
You can't,
you can't shoot a rocket land on that 

2743
01:53:04,541 --> 01:53:04,541
thing and deflect it.
You're talking about a movie.

2744
01:53:04,541 --> 01:53:07,650
It was a great movie if you're high in 
dumb sucked.

2745
01:53:09,330 --> 01:53:11,090
What was better though that one or deep 
impact?

2746
01:53:11,180 --> 01:53:15,050
I liked that movie because it Buschemi 
Buscemi how creepy and weird.

2747
01:53:15,051 --> 01:53:19,820
He was just fucking the rocket and like,
just like that just cracked me up.

2748
01:53:19,821 --> 01:53:24,640
I remember had one of those really 
fucking lame aerosmith like ballads.

2749
01:53:24,650 --> 01:53:25,090
Yeah.
Well,

2750
01:53:26,600 --> 01:53:27,650
no,
not that.

2751
01:53:28,340 --> 01:53:30,350
It's weird to see Steven Tyler.
Man.

2752
01:53:30,560 --> 01:53:31,720
It's weird to see him.
I mean,

2753
01:53:32,350 --> 01:53:35,510
I don't hate the guy.
I'm a huge fan of his earlier stuff.

2754
01:53:35,600 --> 01:53:36,920
Oh,
you talking about American idol?

2755
01:53:36,921 --> 01:53:37,790
Yeah,
it's weird.

2756
01:53:37,820 --> 01:53:42,200
It's weird to see him on American idol.
It's weird to see those ballads to man,

2757
01:53:42,201 --> 01:53:47,201
those,
those movie romantic movie ballads that 

2758
01:53:47,201 --> 01:53:47,900
they started producing that were just,
you know,

2759
01:53:48,070 --> 01:53:50,980
you go back to like walk this way,
you know,

2760
01:53:51,000 --> 01:53:53,240
you go back to some of their shit that 
they put out.

2761
01:53:53,420 --> 01:53:58,420
I mean,
there was just some bad ass rock and 

2762
01:53:58,420 --> 01:53:58,420
roll man.
You know,

2763
01:53:58,420 --> 01:53:58,540
run DMC had to be talked into doing walk
this way.

2764
01:53:59,120 --> 01:54:00,350
They were pissed.
They were like,

2765
01:54:00,351 --> 01:54:04,130
we're lying gangsters.
We don't want to fucking have a guitar.

2766
01:54:04,160 --> 01:54:05,850
And it was like,
then they got theirs.

2767
01:54:06,050 --> 01:54:07,680
I think it was reverend in an interview.
He's like,

2768
01:54:07,880 --> 01:54:09,830
then we've got our first check it.
We were like,

2769
01:54:09,860 --> 01:54:11,690
fuck yeah,
like Rick Rubin.

2770
01:54:11,691 --> 01:54:16,691
They like giving them a high five.
They made more money off their first 

2771
01:54:16,691 --> 01:54:17,240
check from walk this way.

2772
01:54:17,240 --> 01:54:19,190
Then they had their whole career put 
together.

2773
01:54:19,520 --> 01:54:24,520
Well it was a good collaboration to 
actually was one of the few that made 

2774
01:54:24,520 --> 01:54:25,730
both songs better like that.
You know that anthrax one,

2775
01:54:25,731 --> 01:54:27,220
two is pretty good with,
uh,

2776
01:54:27,500 --> 01:54:29,040
with run DMC.
Yeah.

2777
01:54:29,370 --> 01:54:31,960
I don't know that one.
What does that one fuck?

2778
01:54:31,961 --> 01:54:34,460
How does it go?
I remember the video.

2779
01:54:34,461 --> 01:54:35,960
Bring the.
Bring the noise.

2780
01:54:36,160 --> 01:54:36,940
The noise.
Yeah.

2781
01:54:37,130 --> 01:54:38,300
Oh yeah,
that's right.

2782
01:54:38,301 --> 01:54:40,300
Yeah.
Yeah.

2783
01:54:40,310 --> 01:54:41,690
That was cool man.
When rappers,

2784
01:54:41,691 --> 01:54:44,810
I mean now the best things are mashups,
you know,

2785
01:54:44,840 --> 01:54:47,210
when they're not really doing it,
but there's someone else.

2786
01:54:47,211 --> 01:54:48,990
Does it,
do the wire Djs to do it.

2787
01:54:49,100 --> 01:54:53,390
My favorite man is the Jimi Hendrix one 
with a Jay Z.

2788
01:54:53,390 --> 01:54:55,340
Ninety nine problems mixed with Voodoo 
child.

2789
01:54:55,341 --> 01:54:57,830
Oh really?
You never heard that?

2790
01:54:58,270 --> 01:55:03,270
That's my premier workout shit.
When I want to kick things when I'm 

2791
01:55:03,270 --> 01:55:03,350
working out and I want to kick it to the
next level,

2792
01:55:03,470 --> 01:55:06,410
I throw that on because it's just a 
fucking jam.

2793
01:55:06,620 --> 01:55:11,180
Jimi Hendrix Guitar and that 99 problems
song all jammed up into one song.

2794
01:55:11,210 --> 01:55:16,210
Fuck.
Want to go google some shit out of that 

2795
01:55:16,210 --> 01:55:16,210
son?
Listen to some old school,

2796
01:55:16,210 --> 01:55:16,760
daft punk to it.
I should.

2797
01:55:16,761 --> 01:55:19,520
So awesome.
Like the guitar in that one song,

2798
01:55:19,550 --> 01:55:20,750
that punk,
what do they say?

2799
01:55:21,440 --> 01:55:23,540
A stronger,
faster,

2800
01:55:23,541 --> 01:55:24,140
better.
They,

2801
01:55:24,350 --> 01:55:24,860
they,
they,

2802
01:55:24,861 --> 01:55:26,570
uh,
they do a lot of songs.

2803
01:55:26,630 --> 01:55:31,630
Oh,
there's somebody made a mash up of one 

2804
01:55:31,630 --> 01:55:31,630
of my rants from the podcast mixed with 
a daft punk song.

2805
01:55:31,850 --> 01:55:34,370
Yeah,
it's a lot of like mellow,

2806
01:55:34,400 --> 01:55:39,400
kind of like techno type music,
but then they have some just amazing 

2807
01:55:39,400 --> 01:55:40,700
songs and one of the songs it was,
it's called a,

2808
01:55:41,090 --> 01:55:42,740
I think it's called digital love.
Uh,

2809
01:55:43,080 --> 01:55:44,520
it has this awesome guitar

2810
01:55:45,120 --> 01:55:47,640
solo in the middle of it.
That's just pretty bad ass.

2811
01:55:47,641 --> 01:55:49,800
Let me get right into it.
Don't go into,

2812
01:55:49,930 --> 01:55:53,940
we're playing bonnaroo this year and I 
haven't really a the league show.

2813
01:55:53,970 --> 01:55:55,320
We're going to do a league live show 
there.

2814
01:55:55,350 --> 01:55:56,400
What are you going to do?
How do you do that?

2815
01:55:56,430 --> 01:55:57,960
It's,
they have a tent for comedy.

2816
01:55:57,961 --> 01:56:00,480
I think it's like we're going Louis 
blacks going,

2817
01:56:00,590 --> 01:56:01,810
um,
you know,

2818
01:56:01,830 --> 01:56:06,830
so it's like one of the things we do 
like a show together or the four of us 

2819
01:56:06,830 --> 01:56:06,830
to stand up and stuff and.
Oh,

2820
01:56:06,830 --> 01:56:07,350
that's cool.
Fuck around.

2821
01:56:07,620 --> 01:56:08,250
But uh,
yeah,

2822
01:56:08,251 --> 01:56:11,130
I mean like everyone's gonna be there.
I'm an ad's going to be there.

2823
01:56:11,131 --> 01:56:13,950
The black keys.
Mumford and sons.

2824
01:56:13,951 --> 01:56:15,390
Yeah.
Everyone's just going to be.

2825
01:56:15,410 --> 01:56:16,320
It's great.
I hope it's.

2826
01:56:16,321 --> 01:56:18,120
I mean it's an hour outside of 
Nashville,

2827
01:56:18,121 --> 01:56:19,640
so that sounds awesome.
Yes,

2828
01:56:19,790 --> 01:56:21,270
it's the biggest.
It's,

2829
01:56:21,271 --> 01:56:21,990
it's for night.

2830
01:56:21,990 --> 01:56:23,490
It's like a.
it's like Coachella,

2831
01:56:23,550 --> 01:56:28,550
but just.
And they do a lot of standup at those 

2832
01:56:28,550 --> 01:56:28,550
two,
don't.

2833
01:56:28,550 --> 01:56:28,550
They do.
Yeah.

2834
01:56:28,550 --> 01:56:31,790
This is my first experience with that.
I'm doing that and then next week I'm 

2835
01:56:31,790 --> 01:56:31,790
doing this,
this country western.

2836
01:56:31,790 --> 01:56:36,230
I'm a musical festival festival thing.
Me and Jimmy Schubert and John Ray.

2837
01:56:38,580 --> 01:56:39,900
Jimmy might.
We're going.

2838
01:56:39,930 --> 01:56:42,570
This is going to be either the best 
slash worst weekend of my life.

2839
01:56:42,571 --> 01:56:44,610
I haven't seen Jimmy Schubert around in 
ages.

2840
01:56:45,220 --> 01:56:46,610
I know.
It's great.

2841
01:56:46,680 --> 01:56:47,700
So those guys,
man,

2842
01:56:47,701 --> 01:56:52,140
this is the core comedy store group.
I have a question.

2843
01:56:52,210 --> 01:56:54,750
I'm sure your advice on something.
I heard a,

2844
01:56:54,780 --> 01:56:59,780
I was listening to one of the podcast 
you were talking about going through a 

2845
01:56:59,780 --> 01:57:02,370
period where you were on television and 
still doing stand up and you felt old,

2846
01:57:03,000 --> 01:57:08,000
like your shit was getting old and you 
were getting tired of it and I've just 

2847
01:57:08,000 --> 01:57:09,570
recently gone through that or I'm big.
I'm coming out of it.

2848
01:57:09,571 --> 01:57:11,880
I'm not sure what,
how did you know,

2849
01:57:11,910 --> 01:57:16,910
you just,
was it a feeling you had and you're 

2850
01:57:16,910 --> 01:57:16,910
like,
Ugh,

2851
01:57:16,910 --> 01:57:19,130
I feel fucking fake right now.
And then like how did you get yourself 

2852
01:57:19,130 --> 01:57:19,190
out of.

2853
01:57:19,520 --> 01:57:22,160
Did you just stop doing that shit?
Just stop,

2854
01:57:22,161 --> 01:57:23,190
write new stuff,
right?

2855
01:57:23,210 --> 01:57:25,130
You started the abandoned the old 
material.

2856
01:57:25,370 --> 01:57:26,230
Right.
And you know,

2857
01:57:26,240 --> 01:57:28,910
if you haven't recorded it,
just put it on a recording.

2858
01:57:28,940 --> 01:57:31,420
Make sure you do an album,
do a CD,

2859
01:57:31,760 --> 01:57:33,650
do a DVD,
do something,

2860
01:57:33,680 --> 01:57:35,480
but record it and move on.
Yeah.

2861
01:57:35,570 --> 01:57:36,410
Yeah.
It's important,

2862
01:57:36,411 --> 01:57:37,220
man.
You know,

2863
01:57:37,580 --> 01:57:42,580
I didn't do that nearly as much when I 
was younger and I appreciate my act and 

2864
01:57:42,580 --> 01:57:46,631
I appreciate the process a lot more now 
and I don't take it for granted nearly 

2865
01:57:46,631 --> 01:57:46,631
as much now.
You know,

2866
01:57:46,631 --> 01:57:50,030
before when my act was just completely 
solid and it was,

2867
01:57:50,031 --> 01:57:55,031
you know,
this is what I did for the next couple 

2868
01:57:55,031 --> 01:57:55,031
of years and I really didn't add too 
much to it.

2869
01:57:55,190 --> 01:58:00,190
There was a period in the nineties where
I did that where it just wasn't what 

2870
01:58:00,190 --> 01:58:01,670
stanhope wasn't the same thing as,
as it is now,

2871
01:58:01,910 --> 01:58:02,560
now stand up.

2872
01:58:02,560 --> 01:58:07,560
It's just like this living thing that's 
constantly changing and evolving and I 

2873
01:58:07,560 --> 01:58:08,300
can't wait to get rid of my material to 
come out with new shit.

2874
01:58:08,630 --> 01:58:09,890
It's scary.
It's scary.

2875
01:58:09,891 --> 01:58:14,180
It's scary to a band and you know,
you have bits that are just proven gems.

2876
01:58:14,210 --> 01:58:19,210
I know.
It's tough to let those fucking tough 

2877
01:58:19,210 --> 01:58:23,340
dude.
You got to have hours of those things 

2878
01:58:23,340 --> 01:58:23,340
just laying around that I don't even 
remember anymore.

2879
01:58:23,340 --> 01:58:23,580
They're not even mine anymore.
They're,

2880
01:58:23,620 --> 01:58:26,960
they're the ethers or their peoples.
They're my fans stuff,

2881
01:58:27,020 --> 01:58:28,670
you know,
like the Analytical Smith.

2882
01:58:28,671 --> 01:58:31,940
I don't know how to do that anymore.
You know the Tigers fucking bit.

2883
01:58:31,941 --> 01:58:33,350
I don't know how to do that.
Hugh hefner bit.

2884
01:58:33,351 --> 01:58:34,610
I don't know how to do that.
I'm really,

2885
01:58:34,611 --> 01:58:36,410
bits are gone.
I don't know how to do them anymore.

2886
01:58:36,411 --> 01:58:41,411
I mean I get,
I will shout out like very rarely the 

2887
01:58:41,411 --> 01:58:41,411
old ones.
It's more,

2888
01:58:41,411 --> 01:58:42,130
more of the new called Noah's Ark.

2889
01:58:42,130 --> 01:58:43,420
Out of the balloon.
Pretty well.

2890
01:58:43,421 --> 01:58:45,730
That's because I was high as fuck son.
Really?

2891
01:58:45,780 --> 01:58:48,810
I was tuned into the ether.
Um,

2892
01:58:48,870 --> 01:58:53,870
so again this weekend,
Sam Tripoli and Tom Segura and me at 

2893
01:58:53,870 --> 01:58:55,050
Cobb's comedy club,
Thursday,

2894
01:58:55,051 --> 01:58:57,930
Friday and Saturday,
I believe,

2895
01:58:57,931 --> 01:58:59,640
Saturday sold out.
I'm not sure.

2896
01:58:59,641 --> 01:59:01,560
I think most of the shows are almost 
sold out,

2897
01:59:01,561 --> 01:59:06,561
so there's not much left.
And we were doing sales comedy whole 

2898
01:59:06,561 --> 01:59:08,130
Wednesday,
tomorrow night at 8:00

2899
01:59:08,130 --> 01:59:09,540
PM.
Are you doing tomorrow night you around?

2900
01:59:09,900 --> 01:59:10,430
Um,
no,

2901
01:59:10,431 --> 01:59:12,260
I'm going into Vegas.
Powerful Vegas.

2902
01:59:12,261 --> 01:59:13,880
What are you doing?
I've got a bachelor party.

2903
01:59:13,881 --> 01:59:15,710
I'm going to for three or four days.
Yeah,

2904
01:59:15,920 --> 01:59:17,120
stay safe.
Sun.

2905
01:59:17,600 --> 01:59:20,390
Don't do anything crazy.
Relaxing.

2906
01:59:20,420 --> 01:59:20,960
Getting older.

2907
01:59:21,550 --> 01:59:22,720
Um,
so that's it.

2908
01:59:22,721 --> 01:59:24,190
We will be back tomorrow.
Tomorrow.

2909
01:59:24,191 --> 01:59:29,191
We got Doug Benson with us.
Is there any other gigs you want to 

2910
01:59:29,191 --> 01:59:29,191
plug?

2911
01:59:29,191 --> 01:59:29,250
Um,
I'm doing a with Brian Cowen,

2912
01:59:29,260 --> 01:59:33,460
the wrecker theater in Baltimore 
Memorial Day weekend,

2913
01:59:33,461 --> 01:59:35,140
Saturday night we're do two shows at the
theater.

2914
01:59:35,141 --> 01:59:37,030
Me and Brian Cowen.
Nice.

2915
01:59:37,540 --> 01:59:39,010
Not this weekend,
but next weekend.

2916
01:59:39,040 --> 01:59:41,750
I'm in Philadelphia at helium comedy.
How do you,

2917
01:59:41,751 --> 01:59:43,040
when Brian do that?
You do like a coat.

2918
01:59:43,050 --> 01:59:44,410
You haven't done it together yet?
Yeah,

2919
01:59:44,411 --> 01:59:46,160
we haven't done it.
I think this,

2920
01:59:46,500 --> 01:59:47,410
uh,
our agent,

2921
01:59:47,411 --> 01:59:52,411
we have the same.
So did they send this out and do it 

2922
01:59:52,411 --> 01:59:55,501
together?
But so you just flip a coin like you 

2923
01:59:55,501 --> 01:59:55,501
open one,
he'll open the other.

2924
01:59:55,501 --> 01:59:55,501
I think that's how we'll do it.
I haven't talked to Brian about it,

2925
01:59:55,501 --> 01:59:56,830
but I figured that's how we'll do it.

2926
01:59:56,900 --> 01:59:58,160
Powerful.
Powerful.

2927
01:59:58,220 --> 01:59:58,970
Okay.
That's it.

2928
01:59:58,971 --> 02:00:03,971
Ladies and gentlemen,

2932
02:00:09,990 --> 02:00:12,330
percent often.

2949
02:00:46,610 --> 02:00:48,860
It took me like 10 minutes.
They have to figure out how to spell it.

2950
02:00:48,940 --> 02:00:49,880
Yeah.
You know what I did?

2951
02:00:49,930 --> 02:00:54,930
I worked on the twitter page.
If you put it in the at sign and then 

2952
02:00:54,930 --> 02:00:55,520
start Steve and shows me all the steve 
that I have.

2953
02:00:55,580 --> 02:00:57,380
Oh really?
In the R and then it showed me you as an

2954
02:00:57,381 --> 02:00:58,100
