1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Brothers,
what bitches Joe Rogan experience 

2
00:00:06,091 --> 00:00:07,920
podcast is brought to you by the 
fleshlight,

3
00:00:08,250 --> 00:00:12,210
but you know that right?
This ain't your first Rodeo.

4
00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:15,420
If you go to Joe Rogan.net
and click on the link for the flashlight

5
00:00:15,421 --> 00:00:20,421
and entering the codename Brogan,
you will get number one sex toy for men 

6
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:26,420
at 15 percent off.
Wonders of wonders,

7
00:00:27,510 --> 00:00:30,540
way better than masturbating,
but I gotta warn you and you feel like a

8
00:00:30,541 --> 00:00:35,541
fucking loser once it's over,
especially when you're cleaning that 

9
00:00:35,541 --> 00:00:35,541
bitch,
but it's worth it.

10
00:00:35,541 --> 00:00:37,920
You will shoot big loads and they will 
make you think clear,

11
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:38,670
right?
Denny?

12
00:00:38,671 --> 00:00:43,050
Just like fucking Kundalini Yoga.
Basically the same type of shit.

13
00:00:43,530 --> 00:00:48,530
Clean the mind open.
The pipes release the hounds were also 

14
00:00:48,751 --> 00:00:51,870
brought to you by [inaudible] Dot Com,
o n n I t,

15
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:57,080
makers of Alpha brain,
a cognitive enhancing supplemented I am 

16
00:00:57,080 --> 00:00:59,040
on right now.
If you're like,

17
00:00:59,041 --> 00:01:02,490
Hey Joe Rogan while you talk so smooth 
Joe Rogan,

18
00:01:02,580 --> 00:01:06,570
why you got all those words at your Beck
and call Yo Dawg?

19
00:01:06,690 --> 00:01:09,090
I'm on Alpha brain and people like,
hey man,

20
00:01:09,091 --> 00:01:11,310
what's the science behind alphabet?
And go to [inaudible] dot com.

21
00:01:11,311 --> 00:01:13,920
All answers will be given o,
n,

22
00:01:13,921 --> 00:01:14,490
n I,
T,

23
00:01:14,491 --> 00:01:15,930
and we're constantly looking to improve 
that.

24
00:01:15,931 --> 00:01:18,660
Any criticisms that we've had the past,
we absolutely appreciate it.

25
00:01:18,661 --> 00:01:23,661
We are actually about to start a double 
blind study with um,

26
00:01:24,030 --> 00:01:25,000
what's that mean?
Like to,

27
00:01:25,050 --> 00:01:26,490
to blank.
Like shut up.

28
00:01:26,620 --> 00:01:28,790
Shut your out Brian with this double 
line.

29
00:01:28,890 --> 00:01:30,770
Well,
you got to fucking read online.

30
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:32,120
Needed to read Google,
Google,

31
00:01:32,180 --> 00:01:37,180
double blind spot on the street.
Suddenly the disrespect site on the 

32
00:01:37,180 --> 00:01:39,450
street as you take the fucking bill,
you drink coconut water and you jerk off

33
00:01:39,451 --> 00:01:41,900
into the cup and you look in the Cup 
afterwards.

34
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:43,920
That's fucking mind boggling right 
there.

35
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:44,360
Okay.
I,

36
00:01:44,890 --> 00:01:47,100
that's the fucking deal.
Do you take the two pills?

37
00:01:47,101 --> 00:01:48,200
Whatever the fuck.
CEO.

38
00:01:48,490 --> 00:01:49,560
We're also a.

39
00:01:49,590 --> 00:01:53,070
We make a shrewd anyway,
so people that have been asking for more

40
00:01:53,071 --> 00:01:53,820
tests,
tests,

41
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:55,310
so we're on that.
It's going to work.

42
00:01:55,340 --> 00:01:58,290
We're spending a lot of money to make 
sure that this stuff is all legit.

43
00:01:58,291 --> 00:01:59,700
It is legit for me,
I use it.

44
00:01:59,701 --> 00:02:02,130
It works without a doubt.
No questions for me.

45
00:02:02,131 --> 00:02:03,480
I've tried it,
I've gotten off of it.

46
00:02:03,481 --> 00:02:08,481
I've tried it again.
I've fucked with myself as much as 

47
00:02:08,481 --> 00:02:08,481
possible to see it placebo effect.
It's not there,

48
00:02:08,490 --> 00:02:11,670
it's legit.
I also love shroom Tech Sport,

49
00:02:11,671 --> 00:02:13,440
which is the [inaudible] mushroom 
supplement,

50
00:02:13,590 --> 00:02:14,580
a supplement that,
uh,

51
00:02:14,610 --> 00:02:19,610
it aids your,
your body's aids in your body's ability 

52
00:02:19,610 --> 00:02:22,071
to process oxygen really makes a 
difference in any extreme exercise.

53
00:02:22,591 --> 00:02:27,591
If you're into Jujitsu,
if you take like Kettlebell classes are 

54
00:02:27,591 --> 00:02:30,120
into crossfit or anything like that,
you will definitely find an advantage.

55
00:02:30,121 --> 00:02:33,000
You will definitely feel an effect of 
the shroom tech sport,

56
00:02:33,001 --> 00:02:38,001
but if you just like a regular person 
who doesn't exercise or you barely 

57
00:02:38,001 --> 00:02:38,001
exercise,
don't,

58
00:02:38,001 --> 00:02:38,510
don't waste your money back.

59
00:02:39,420 --> 00:02:44,420
If you also go to [inaudible] dot com,
we also have a shroom tech immune which 

60
00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:46,920
everyone should check out.
It's fascinating and the way it works,

61
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:50,130
the way it's been explained to me,
I'm obviously no scientist,

62
00:02:50,250 --> 00:02:54,660
but your body recognizes this mushroom 
different mushrooms than the shrimp tech

63
00:02:54,661 --> 00:02:59,661
support.
Your body recognizes it as a possible 

64
00:02:59,661 --> 00:03:02,480
disease or a cold,
so your immune system fires up for a 

65
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:05,491
fight that never takes place and so just
really generally boost your immune 

66
00:03:05,491 --> 00:03:05,491
system.
I,

67
00:03:05,491 --> 00:03:09,450
I am a big believer in a bunch of 
different things to keep your immune 

68
00:03:09,450 --> 00:03:10,090
system strong.
I'm a big believer in this room,

69
00:03:10,091 --> 00:03:15,091
tech immune,
but I'm also a big believer in 

70
00:03:15,091 --> 00:03:15,091
probiotics and everyone should look into
that.

71
00:03:15,091 --> 00:03:18,130
I have no financial stake in this,
but drink a Kombucha tea.

72
00:03:18,370 --> 00:03:20,800
You know,
a lot of people have been,

73
00:03:20,860 --> 00:03:25,860
um,
just just talking so highly about the 

74
00:03:25,860 --> 00:03:26,770
benefits,
the health benefits of this stuff,

75
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:27,970
you know,
for years and years.

76
00:03:27,970 --> 00:03:30,370
And I never,
I did it when I first came to la.

77
00:03:30,371 --> 00:03:31,240
I tried it,
but I was like,

78
00:03:31,241 --> 00:03:34,180
the stuff tastes kind of nasty.
It's a weird sort of an acquired taste.

79
00:03:34,540 --> 00:03:39,250
But then about a year or two years ago,
I started drinking it on a regular basis

80
00:03:39,251 --> 00:03:44,251
because gts,
Kombucha and they make synergy and all 

81
00:03:44,251 --> 00:03:44,251
these different,
uh,

82
00:03:44,251 --> 00:03:48,510
different flavors.
They started selling them at whole 

83
00:03:48,510 --> 00:03:48,510
foods.
So it was like super easy to buy.

84
00:03:48,510 --> 00:03:49,120
And I started drinking them all the 
time.

85
00:03:49,121 --> 00:03:51,490
And one thing I noticed is I stopped 
getting sick.

86
00:03:51,850 --> 00:03:56,850
I think it has a big difference when you
take in a live organisms like 

87
00:03:57,160 --> 00:03:59,050
probiotics,
whether it's Acidophilus,

88
00:03:59,051 --> 00:04:04,051
that's another great one to take and 
spend the money and get that shit that 

89
00:04:04,051 --> 00:04:06,961
you have to keep in your refrigerator if
you can afford it because that's what 

90
00:04:06,961 --> 00:04:07,330
you really want.
They're really healthy live cultures and

91
00:04:07,331 --> 00:04:12,331
essentially what it does is you know 
these live cultures act as a security 

92
00:04:12,331 --> 00:04:13,630
force and they fight off all the country
cultures,

93
00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:16,240
so any any country bacteria that you 
come across,

94
00:04:16,390 --> 00:04:21,390
you want to have these probiotics at 
your beck and call like a live army to 

95
00:04:21,641 --> 00:04:26,641
fight off the cons of the disease world,
so look at it that way and this is by 

96
00:04:26,641 --> 00:04:26,710
the way,
nothing that we sell,

97
00:04:26,711 --> 00:04:29,160
but get your ass on some acidophilus.

98
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:32,040
Get your ass on some Kombucha tea 
checkout.

99
00:04:32,290 --> 00:04:37,290
We also have a new mood which they five 
htp enhancement supplement and what that

100
00:04:38,171 --> 00:04:40,480
is is a five htp actually helps your 
brain,

101
00:04:40,690 --> 00:04:44,650
builds serotonin and interesting stuff.
If you were on antidepressants,

102
00:04:44,651 --> 00:04:49,651
they recommend you not take it because 
it actually can give you too much 

103
00:04:49,651 --> 00:04:50,110
serotonin along with your 
antidepressants together.

104
00:04:50,111 --> 00:04:55,111
Combined is not so good,
so talk to your doctor and all that 

105
00:04:55,111 --> 00:04:55,111
stuff,
but by itself,

106
00:04:55,111 --> 00:04:56,710
if you're not on any medication,
it's absolutely safe.

107
00:04:56,740 --> 00:04:59,380
Just don't go crazy and take the whole 
bottle in one sitting.

108
00:04:59,381 --> 00:05:01,360
You fucking freak.
You're on cocaine today.

109
00:05:01,390 --> 00:05:01,750
No,
no.

110
00:05:01,751 --> 00:05:03,820
I'm healthy.
I'm healthy and working out.

111
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:05,590
I've been working out for the first time
in months,

112
00:05:05,591 --> 00:05:07,090
man,
about this fucking pulled muscle.

113
00:05:07,091 --> 00:05:08,290
You are.
You're on fire today.

114
00:05:08,291 --> 00:05:09,820
I did kettle bells.
I did.

115
00:05:09,821 --> 00:05:11,230
I kicked the bag.
I'm a fucking.

116
00:05:11,230 --> 00:05:12,430
I'm back.
Bitches.

117
00:05:12,670 --> 00:05:14,320
Oh Shit.
Anyway,

118
00:05:15,550 --> 00:05:20,550
go to [inaudible] Dot com o n I n o n n 
I t o n n I t.com

119
00:05:21,190 --> 00:05:23,320
entering the codename Rogan and you will
get 10 percent off.

120
00:05:23,410 --> 00:05:28,410
Most importantly when you order every 
order that you get is 100 percent money 

121
00:05:29,111 --> 00:05:31,690
back guarantee,
but only for the first 30 pills.

122
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:36,840
And he say why?
He used to be 100 percent guarantee all 

123
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:36,840
the time because the world is full of 
concrete.

124
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:40,920
That's why.
And because some douchebag thought it'd 

125
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:43,410
be cool to odor a fuck load of bottles,
get all of his money back and then sell 

126
00:05:43,410 --> 00:05:44,290
the bottles on Ebay.
So because of the cost of the world,

127
00:05:44,291 --> 00:05:46,900
even as you make a big order and you 
decide somewhere along the line that you

128
00:05:46,901 --> 00:05:48,370
don't like it,
you can't get your money back.

129
00:05:48,820 --> 00:05:53,820
So if you,
if you do want your money back and it's 

130
00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:55,711
a big order,
you have to send in the unopened 

131
00:05:55,711 --> 00:05:57,271
bottles.
The first 30 pills though you can eat 

132
00:05:57,271 --> 00:05:57,271
them,
you can stuff them up your ass,

133
00:05:57,271 --> 00:05:58,060
you can throw them in the toilet,
whatever the fuck you want

134
00:05:58,060 --> 00:06:03,060
to do with them.
And then tell us I don't like it and we 

135
00:06:03,060 --> 00:06:03,290
give you all your money back.
Why?

136
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:06,680
Because I'm in a weird position.
I'm in a position where people are like,

137
00:06:06,681 --> 00:06:09,230
what do you try to rip people off?
Absolutely fucking not.

138
00:06:09,260 --> 00:06:14,260
But I do believe in this stuff.
And there's only one way to sell 

139
00:06:14,260 --> 00:06:14,260
something.
You believe in it.

140
00:06:14,260 --> 00:06:17,840
You got to sell it and make it as easy 
as possible for everybody.

141
00:06:17,841 --> 00:06:22,160
And make your intentions as positive.
And as clear as possible,

142
00:06:22,161 --> 00:06:27,161
and I don't think you can be any clear 
than offering someone 100 percent of 

143
00:06:27,161 --> 00:06:27,620
their money back.
If they don't like the product,

144
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:30,140
you don't have to send it in.
You don't have to do shit.

145
00:06:30,170 --> 00:06:32,660
Just if you the first 30 pills,
just take them.

146
00:06:32,750 --> 00:06:34,430
And then if you don't like it,
you get your money back.

147
00:06:34,580 --> 00:06:36,380
Also,
if you think it's too expensive,

148
00:06:36,381 --> 00:06:38,390
I urge you,
go to the website.

149
00:06:38,420 --> 00:06:43,420
All the ingredients are clearly listed 
in the exact doses by all this stuff in 

150
00:06:43,420 --> 00:06:45,500
bulk.
And save money and do it at a discount.

151
00:06:45,501 --> 00:06:47,090
Make your own Alpha brain.
Try it out.

152
00:06:47,300 --> 00:06:49,220
I don't care.
Use other people's stuff.

153
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:52,430
Have a good life.
Eat nutrients,

154
00:06:52,431 --> 00:06:54,320
take vitamins,
eat healthy food,

155
00:06:54,321 --> 00:06:56,870
eat fresh vegetables.
Get Your Dick sucked.

156
00:06:56,871 --> 00:06:59,390
Every now and again,
am I right Joe Diaz?

157
00:06:59,450 --> 00:07:00,530
Come on,
am I right?

158
00:07:00,531 --> 00:07:01,190
Eddie?
Bravo.

159
00:07:01,220 --> 00:07:02,900
Fucking old jokes.
Add that in there too.

160
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:05,600
You've got some old couple jumping 
jacks.

161
00:07:05,601 --> 00:07:07,010
A little swimming.
Let's kick this.

162
00:07:07,380 --> 00:07:09,140
Kick this motherfucker.
Here we go.

163
00:07:12,470 --> 00:07:14,210
Joe Rogan podcast,
my life.

164
00:07:20,060 --> 00:07:23,360
Thank God men like Nick Diaz exist this 
weekend.

165
00:07:23,540 --> 00:07:26,930
Nick Diaz and Carlos Condit.
Thank God those guys exist.

166
00:07:27,140 --> 00:07:32,140
Thank God those guys exist and thank God
those guys have built themselves up to 

167
00:07:32,140 --> 00:07:34,880
the point where this is one of those 
matches were five fucking round,

168
00:07:34,881 --> 00:07:35,750
man.
You can't wait.

169
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:37,280
You're gonna.
Be Palm sweaty.

170
00:07:37,281 --> 00:07:39,230
Rubbing your hands together before that 
bitch.

171
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:41,120
I don't know who's going to be the 
referee for this.

172
00:07:41,330 --> 00:07:46,330
I don't know who it is,
but before that one person looks at the 

173
00:07:46,330 --> 00:07:46,330
Blue Corner and works in the red corner 
and then said,

174
00:07:46,330 --> 00:07:48,530
fight.
That shit is going to be crazy.

175
00:07:49,180 --> 00:07:54,180
Carlos Congo,
who's been trying for eight years for 

176
00:07:54,180 --> 00:07:54,180
the fucking fight,
fucking training.

177
00:07:54,180 --> 00:07:56,000
Every two months they change a folder.
It's perfect.

178
00:07:56,001 --> 00:07:56,780
He said,
19.

179
00:07:56,781 --> 00:07:58,040
Fucking apologize.
Batman.

180
00:07:58,120 --> 00:07:59,930
He's on one.
It's really for him.

181
00:07:59,931 --> 00:08:02,750
I think it's perfect because he's.
He's so prepared.

182
00:08:03,740 --> 00:08:05,240
It was a perfect time for him.

183
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:06,770
You know?
60 plus 1:30.

184
00:08:06,771 --> 00:08:09,230
The line is not that bad.
It's minus one six.

185
00:08:09,231 --> 00:08:11,600
You would be crazy to pick a favorite in
this fight.

186
00:08:11,750 --> 00:08:16,750
I think he'd be crazy.
I think that this is one of those who 

187
00:08:16,750 --> 00:08:16,880
the fuck knows what's going to happen.
Fights this could be.

188
00:08:17,150 --> 00:08:19,180
Who knows?
It's going to be amazing.

189
00:08:19,220 --> 00:08:24,220
That's Roy Nelson to tell about that.
Oh,

190
00:08:24,380 --> 00:08:29,380
how about Hanan Barao and Scott Jorgen 
that Hanan Barao dude,

191
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:34,840
he's the dark horse of the pound for 
pound division because he's not a 

192
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:35,450
champion yet,
but he might be one of the top pound for

193
00:08:35,451 --> 00:08:37,310
pound guys.
He's right up there with Aldo.

194
00:08:37,490 --> 00:08:42,490
He's a beast.
Did you see his last fight with brand 

195
00:08:42,490 --> 00:08:44,861
picket?
He hit home boy with a knee to the face 

196
00:08:44,861 --> 00:08:46,640
with no jump.
Just fucking leapt up with this knee,

197
00:08:46,790 --> 00:08:51,790
you know,
instead of that thing where they lift 

198
00:08:51,790 --> 00:08:51,790
the front leg and then they come up with
the right leg.

199
00:08:51,790 --> 00:08:55,630
They'll start with the left leg and then
they use it as forced to kick up with 

200
00:08:55,630 --> 00:08:58,640
the right leg.
Some of these bad ass Brazilians like 

201
00:08:58,640 --> 00:08:59,850
Anderson can do it too,
where they just fly through the air with

202
00:08:59,851 --> 00:09:04,230
one knee and just lifted that knee up 
and crack caught.

203
00:09:04,260 --> 00:09:05,750
Caught Brad Pickett in the chin.
I mean,

204
00:09:05,751 --> 00:09:07,890
he's a beast.
Do M is Jujitsu.

205
00:09:07,891 --> 00:09:09,920
It's fucking sick.
You know,

206
00:09:09,930 --> 00:09:13,230
as soon as Brad Pickett,
like stumbled and he saw position,

207
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:15,480
he'd jumped on that back.
So quick man.

208
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:17,000
It was a thing of beauty man.

209
00:09:18,180 --> 00:09:21,720
I saw the UFC special on Nick Diaz.
Carlos condit.

210
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:24,270
Which one?
Episode one Shit,

211
00:09:24,271 --> 00:09:25,430
I don't know.
Episode two.

212
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:31,280
I don't know if it's aired yet.
Is it the one where they haven't been 

213
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:34,710
years like kindergarten teacher.
She remembered neck.

214
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:36,920
Remember Nick,
and this is.

215
00:09:37,110 --> 00:09:42,110
I learned a lot about nick and I come up
with a hypothesis.

216
00:09:42,630 --> 00:09:46,260
You know before,
when was in the early days if you were a

217
00:09:46,261 --> 00:09:47,760
black belt in Jujitsu,
shit,

218
00:09:47,761 --> 00:09:51,810
you had a shot at the title and then it 
became if you were an Olympic wrestler,

219
00:09:51,811 --> 00:09:56,811
damn you have a shot at the time.
Now it's obvious now it's becoming more 

220
00:09:56,811 --> 00:09:58,260
like all other sports,
like if you didn't wrestle,

221
00:09:58,290 --> 00:10:03,290
do Jiu Jitsu and,
and worked on striking since day one as 

222
00:10:03,290 --> 00:10:03,290
a kid.
[inaudible].

223
00:10:03,290 --> 00:10:05,190
There's so many kids doing that.
All three now.

224
00:10:05,460 --> 00:10:10,460
You don't want,
you're not going to have a shot in the 

225
00:10:10,460 --> 00:10:10,460
very near future.

226
00:10:10,460 --> 00:10:12,120
And I think there's one.
There's one more factor,

227
00:10:12,390 --> 00:10:17,390
and that's the Nick Diaz factor.
There's obviously he doesn't like 

228
00:10:17,390 --> 00:10:17,600
cameras.
He's,

229
00:10:17,690 --> 00:10:22,690
he said it a million times.
He doesn't like to talk in front of 

230
00:10:22,690 --> 00:10:22,690
cameras.
He's not,

231
00:10:22,690 --> 00:10:22,850
you know,
um,

232
00:10:23,130 --> 00:10:23,790
you know,
he's,

233
00:10:23,850 --> 00:10:24,480
he's,
he's,

234
00:10:24,810 --> 00:10:28,350
he's not into it and maybe he shy in 
front of the camera or whatever.

235
00:10:28,470 --> 00:10:33,470
And his teacher was even saying that he 
wasn't the most vocal guy and,

236
00:10:33,681 --> 00:10:38,681
and,
and he had trouble expressing himself 

237
00:10:38,681 --> 00:10:39,400
and all that shit.
And um,

238
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:44,040
when he gets in that cage and that door 
slammed shut and the crowd is roaring,

239
00:10:44,220 --> 00:10:47,550
there's no more fucking talking.
He just comes alive.

240
00:10:47,551 --> 00:10:51,030
He looks at his opponent is like nobody 
can fucking hear you.

241
00:10:51,090 --> 00:10:53,220
You can be the most articulate,
funny,

242
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:56,100
charismatic guy on the fucking planet.
But you know what?

243
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:59,580
I fucking run all day.
Swim all day,

244
00:10:59,790 --> 00:11:02,670
do box.
I got a crazy Chen.

245
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:05,370
I'm gonna fucking kill this 
motherfucker.

246
00:11:05,790 --> 00:11:07,980
That's like a,
that's an x factor right there.

247
00:11:07,981 --> 00:11:10,860
If you didn't like,
you have to look for that.

248
00:11:10,861 --> 00:11:15,000
I think in the future in fighters,
like do they have that switch where when

249
00:11:15,001 --> 00:11:17,400
they fucking get in that cage,
it's just,

250
00:11:17,401 --> 00:11:19,700
it really is like life or death.
His is a very good,

251
00:11:19,701 --> 00:11:19,720
a

252
00:11:19,740 --> 00:11:21,890
different thing than anybody else's.
First of all.

253
00:11:21,891 --> 00:11:26,891
His approach to it is so different than 
anybody else's in that he does like 

254
00:11:26,891 --> 00:11:30,070
endurance training,
like long distance marathon type 

255
00:11:30,070 --> 00:11:32,210
training and basically forces these guys
to try to keep up with them.

256
00:11:32,660 --> 00:11:37,660
I mean he basically puts them into an 
endurance contest and tries to get them 

257
00:11:37,660 --> 00:11:40,571
to keep up with them.
That's why he does a lot of juking and 

258
00:11:40,571 --> 00:11:40,700
lot of getting in their face.
All that stuff tenses you up,

259
00:11:40,701 --> 00:11:43,790
all that stuff.
All those punches that he throws at 50,

260
00:11:43,791 --> 00:11:46,220
60 percent,
all those tighten you up.

261
00:11:46,310 --> 00:11:51,310
You know,
one of the things that frank shamrock 

262
00:11:51,310 --> 00:11:51,310
said was that when,
when Nick Diaz was punching me,

263
00:11:51,310 --> 00:11:51,890
pitch you so often you can't breathe.
You don't know when to breathe.

264
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:54,610
You can't relax because you,
you never get to relax because they're,

265
00:11:54,611 --> 00:11:55,840
they're just,
they just keep coming,

266
00:11:56,020 --> 00:11:57,070
which is just different.

267
00:11:57,100 --> 00:11:59,080
He just,
he just fights in a different way.

268
00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:04,260
I think the way it does it is brilliant.
It's so brilliant because no one else 

269
00:12:04,260 --> 00:12:05,080
did it before him.
No one else figured out that that way to

270
00:12:05,081 --> 00:12:09,430
fight no one else really would not just 
have great skills,

271
00:12:09,730 --> 00:12:14,620
but have ridiculous worldclass endurance
like swim from Alcatraz endurance.

272
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:17,740
That's the shit man.
They said they went through a countdown.

273
00:12:17,830 --> 00:12:22,830
He sparked like some ridiculous amount 
of rounds that he ran five miles and 

274
00:12:22,830 --> 00:12:25,120
then he swam for an hour and a half.
That was just one day.

275
00:12:25,900 --> 00:12:30,900
He just does that all day.
You still maybe maybe he has some kind 

276
00:12:30,900 --> 00:12:33,310
of condition where he's obsessed with 
exercise.

277
00:12:33,790 --> 00:12:34,330
I don't know.
I mean,

278
00:12:34,331 --> 00:12:35,610
I think he loves it for sure.
I mean,

279
00:12:35,950 --> 00:12:37,060
when he was a kid,
he said that he,

280
00:12:37,061 --> 00:12:37,510
you know,
he,

281
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:39,610
I think he said it was one of the 
countdown shows.

282
00:12:39,611 --> 00:12:39,930
His,
uh,

283
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:40,780
his,
uh,

284
00:12:40,781 --> 00:12:44,230
think it was his uncle or someone was 
like a track coach.

285
00:12:44,231 --> 00:12:45,340
Yeah.
He used to take him,

286
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:46,750
his grandfather,
Danny.

287
00:12:46,751 --> 00:12:47,710
Proper ghosts.

288
00:12:47,980 --> 00:12:50,680
But that's the other thing too.
The other thing too with him,

289
00:12:50,860 --> 00:12:52,930
you know what?
He doesn't like fucking talking.

290
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:54,610
You smoke a joint.
What do you feel like?

291
00:12:54,611 --> 00:12:56,470
Do I go for a fucking run?
See what happens to you.

292
00:12:56,471 --> 00:12:57,730
It feels great.
It feels great.

293
00:12:57,760 --> 00:12:58,790
It feels open.
Joint.

294
00:12:58,820 --> 00:13:03,820
I go to fucking swim fit for an hour 
where you feel like fucking Hercules' 

295
00:13:03,820 --> 00:13:03,820
when you.
That's my world.

296
00:13:03,820 --> 00:13:05,770
I love this fucking world.
Smokes weed.

297
00:13:05,970 --> 00:13:08,170
What his insurance comes from from 
going,

298
00:13:08,171 --> 00:13:10,690
I don't want to hang out with these dumb
fucks is I might stab somebody.

299
00:13:10,870 --> 00:13:12,860
I'll just smoke a joint rental,
left the fucking highway.

300
00:13:12,861 --> 00:13:14,920
Where's law?
And he runs the fucking two hours.

301
00:13:15,130 --> 00:13:20,130
When I lived in boulder,
I used to smoke and run and the high 

302
00:13:20,130 --> 00:13:21,790
when you finish fucking run is a 
complete different dimension.

303
00:13:21,820 --> 00:13:23,770
Yeah.
Even when you smoke and lift man,

304
00:13:23,890 --> 00:13:26,650
everyday feel you feel all your muscle 
tissue.

305
00:13:26,650 --> 00:13:28,720
Like when he pressing weights,
he feel it.

306
00:13:28,930 --> 00:13:31,100
You feel your whole body moving and 
swipe in.

307
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:33,090
At Roland they say,
well,

308
00:13:33,100 --> 00:13:37,810
not just at Yoga and smoking the way 
you're supposed to do,

309
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:42,960
and I used to eat it to take a little 
piece of banana bread or a little hash 

310
00:13:43,211 --> 00:13:45,200
cookie.
I take it in seven in the morning,

311
00:13:45,230 --> 00:13:46,210
go to 8:30
years old.

312
00:13:46,211 --> 00:13:47,650
You know,
my head is at 8:30

313
00:13:48,380 --> 00:13:50,410
and the bitches smoking.
Yeah.

314
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:53,320
And I would just go into it little by 
little and it's amazing.

315
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:55,270
It's fucking amazing when you walk out 
of there,

316
00:13:55,271 --> 00:13:57,130
you don't know what agent you really 
don't.

317
00:13:57,280 --> 00:13:59,890
So that's what my thing is with him,
that he just,

318
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,570
you know what,
he's not the type of guy that's going to

319
00:14:01,571 --> 00:14:03,130
go to a club or whatever.
What would you do?

320
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:04,000
Smoke,
smoking.

321
00:14:04,010 --> 00:14:05,580
Joe.
He's the last guy I'd

322
00:14:05,590 --> 00:14:10,590
want to fight because think about it,
like compare them to GSP and even John 

323
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:14,040
Jones and Anderson Silva that what he 
has,

324
00:14:14,140 --> 00:14:19,140
they don't have.
Maybe they will develop it is he will 

325
00:14:19,140 --> 00:14:23,580
stand right in front of you and exchange
with you and he's down to go to war 

326
00:14:23,981 --> 00:14:26,410
right in front of you.
I mean,

327
00:14:26,411 --> 00:14:27,150
not very.
I mean,

328
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:32,160
GSP ain't gonna do that,
Jon Jones probably won't even do that 

329
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:35,340
and if you decide to take him down,
he'll fuck you up on the ground to his 

330
00:14:35,340 --> 00:14:35,410
Jujitsu.
It's amazing.

331
00:14:37,100 --> 00:14:40,690
What the fuck are you going to do that?
What are you going to do with Nick Diaz?

332
00:14:40,691 --> 00:14:42,720
And he was killing you.
Going to do with him Cyborg.

333
00:14:42,721 --> 00:14:47,721
You was killing sideboards standing up.
So sidebar took them down and whip 

334
00:14:47,721 --> 00:14:48,310
armbar within 30 seconds he had him in 
an arm bar.

335
00:14:48,630 --> 00:14:50,800
I mean,
GSP might be able to take him down.

336
00:14:51,100 --> 00:14:53,180
What is he going to do?
He's not going to pass this guard.

337
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:55,600
He's not gonna pass.
Nick Diaz's guard.

338
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:58,190
He doesn't get tired when you're on top 
of him either.

339
00:14:58,220 --> 00:14:59,450
You know a lot of dudes,
man,

340
00:14:59,451 --> 00:15:01,430
you put them on their back and they just
get exhausted.

341
00:15:01,431 --> 00:15:06,431
They get demoralized,
they get exhausted unless we see his 

342
00:15:06,431 --> 00:15:07,960
chin fall apart.
Man,

343
00:15:08,050 --> 00:15:09,440
I don't,
I can't see him lose.

344
00:15:09,441 --> 00:15:14,441
Well,
you know that can happen to some 

345
00:15:14,441 --> 00:15:14,441
fighters when they take beatings.
No,

346
00:15:14,441 --> 00:15:16,310
that can't happen.
We've seen it happen over and over.

347
00:15:16,311 --> 00:15:19,100
You know,
and vandelay and so many guys,

348
00:15:19,101 --> 00:15:24,101
chuck eventually that they had iron 
chance and they would come even if they 

349
00:15:24,101 --> 00:15:25,610
got randomly,
never had an iron chin.

350
00:15:25,611 --> 00:15:27,280
Vandelay got dropped a lot.
Soccer.

351
00:15:27,300 --> 00:15:28,920
Robert dropped him.
A lot of people dropped them.

352
00:15:28,921 --> 00:15:30,350
Henderson had.
I'm really badly her.

353
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:32,240
He just was a lot worse.
Now.

354
00:15:32,300 --> 00:15:34,160
It's a lot worse,
arguably,

355
00:15:34,340 --> 00:15:35,950
arguably,
but you know,

356
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:39,020
he was already just this dude who ran 
face for first.

357
00:15:39,021 --> 00:15:39,510
You know,
he did.

358
00:15:39,511 --> 00:15:41,080
One of the things that made vandelay 
great was,

359
00:15:41,081 --> 00:15:42,320
Whoa,
how reckless he was.

360
00:15:42,530 --> 00:15:43,490
You know,
he didn't give a fuck.

361
00:15:43,491 --> 00:15:45,890
He would charge that.
You literally like a wild dog.

362
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:47,960
You know,
he built like a pit bull just running at

363
00:15:47,961 --> 00:15:49,550
you.
But that style,

364
00:15:49,551 --> 00:15:51,230
it gets you hurt.
You know that style.

365
00:15:51,231 --> 00:15:56,231
I mean he's not,
it's not a coincidence that he's the 

366
00:15:56,231 --> 00:15:59,681
only guy of his era that had to have 
facial reconstruction so he could 

367
00:15:59,681 --> 00:15:59,681
breathe,
you know,

368
00:15:59,681 --> 00:16:01,160
his,
his nose was flattened,

369
00:16:01,161 --> 00:16:06,161
smashed flat.
And if you go and look at his face from 

370
00:16:06,161 --> 00:16:09,461
when he first entered into pride and 
then his face in his first UFC fight 

371
00:16:09,461 --> 00:16:10,610
with chuck,
he's a completely different person.

372
00:16:10,611 --> 00:16:11,660
You didn't even recognize him.

373
00:16:11,660 --> 00:16:14,720
He was a handsome guy when he first got 
into interpride,

374
00:16:14,820 --> 00:16:17,720
who's I have fucking some guy vendelay 
look at values.

375
00:16:17,721 --> 00:16:19,220
Hot.
Pretty sexy.

376
00:16:20,330 --> 00:16:23,090
I danced with him.
If he was cute.

377
00:16:23,330 --> 00:16:28,330
He was a sexy.
It was a completely different looking 

378
00:16:28,330 --> 00:16:28,330
person,
you know?

379
00:16:28,330 --> 00:16:28,360
No Kara as well.
No,

380
00:16:28,380 --> 00:16:31,690
Gary's face looks way different to.
How about nate fucking Diaz?

381
00:16:31,730 --> 00:16:34,100
Holy Shit.
And it's like a carbon capo.

382
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:36,860
Nick Diaz.
Nick Diaz is.

383
00:16:36,861 --> 00:16:39,560
We don't just have one that's fucking 
incredible.

384
00:16:39,650 --> 00:16:43,160
He was just like maybe a year behind 
Nick Diaz sort of in development.

385
00:16:43,161 --> 00:16:48,161
It seemed like maybe in Jujitsu was a 
little behind and in the striking 

386
00:16:48,161 --> 00:16:51,670
striking power.
And now he's like caught up to nick had 

387
00:16:51,670 --> 00:16:52,520
some weight problems to where he didn't 
cut the weight.

388
00:16:52,521 --> 00:16:54,020
Right.
And now he cuts it right.

389
00:16:54,170 --> 00:16:57,040
And now he has way more energy because 
when he went up to one 70,

390
00:16:57,170 --> 00:17:02,170
you know,
he had some fights where he looked bad 

391
00:17:02,170 --> 00:17:02,170
ass like the rory mark and fight holy 
shit.

392
00:17:02,170 --> 00:17:02,450
And I thought,
man,

393
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:04,430
you know,
this kid is draining themselves too much

394
00:17:04,431 --> 00:17:07,880
to get down to 55.
But then he figured out how to do 55.

395
00:17:07,881 --> 00:17:12,881
Right?
And he came in and the goal fight just 

396
00:17:12,881 --> 00:17:14,830
fucking lit me up.
But serone fight was even more 

397
00:17:14,830 --> 00:17:15,380
impressive because he did it for three 
fucking rounds.

398
00:17:15,530 --> 00:17:18,500
So it shows that he's got endurance at 
1:55

399
00:17:18,501 --> 00:17:20,540
two.
And he lit cowboy up.

400
00:17:20,541 --> 00:17:21,350
Man.
I mean that.

401
00:17:21,530 --> 00:17:24,380
I thought that was going to be a crazy 
close fight.

402
00:17:24,590 --> 00:17:26,330
It's like sort of how I feel about this 
condit fight.

403
00:17:26,331 --> 00:17:27,470
I don't know what the hell's going to 
happen.

404
00:17:27,471 --> 00:17:28,160
I look at it,
I'm like,

405
00:17:28,220 --> 00:17:30,200
man,
both guys are tough as fuck.

406
00:17:30,201 --> 00:17:33,950
Both guys have mad skills.
Both guys can survive.

407
00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:36,440
Some dudes can't be the nail.
You know,

408
00:17:36,441 --> 00:17:39,230
some dudes can be the hammer,
but when they the nail they fall apart.

409
00:17:39,530 --> 00:17:40,840
Conduct doesn't fall apart.
Man.

410
00:17:40,841 --> 00:17:45,841
And Connie got bombed on by Jake 
Ellenberger ellenberger had him in all 

411
00:17:45,841 --> 00:17:47,420
sorts of trouble and ellenberger puts 
people away.

412
00:17:47,421 --> 00:17:52,421
That kid hits fucking hard.
He's one of the hardest hitting guys at 

413
00:17:52,421 --> 00:17:54,420
one 70.
And he bombed condit and conduct,

414
00:17:54,450 --> 00:17:55,950
covered up,
weathered the storm,

415
00:17:55,951 --> 00:17:58,380
and came back.
That was the first fucking around man.

416
00:17:58,530 --> 00:18:03,530
He was in all sorts of trouble in the 
first round where a lot of lot of 

417
00:18:03,530 --> 00:18:03,530
referees would have pulled that trigger 
router.

418
00:18:03,530 --> 00:18:07,920
A lot of referees would have stopped 
that fight if they didn't respect him 

419
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:07,920
and they didn't know him.
If he was like a new guy into the UFC,

420
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:08,790
how did that fight end?
Again,

421
00:18:09,060 --> 00:18:10,800
he wanted a decision what?
A close decision,

422
00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:15,150
but it was a great fucking fight.
But what it proved to me is that conduit

423
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:18,570
is no front runner.
He's a dude that is in it to win it.

424
00:18:18,570 --> 00:18:23,570
The Rory Macdonald fight.
Another perfect example of that third 

425
00:18:23,570 --> 00:18:24,660
round came back and stopped him,
lost the first two rounds,

426
00:18:24,661 --> 00:18:25,980
came back in the third round,
stopped them.

427
00:18:25,981 --> 00:18:28,980
And that kid is a fucking phenol man.
That Rory Macdonald,

428
00:18:28,981 --> 00:18:30,470
man,
he was a fucking elbow.

429
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:33,180
He got it.
He crushed them on the ground.

430
00:18:33,181 --> 00:18:34,860
He broke his face open on the ground.
He,

431
00:18:34,861 --> 00:18:36,300
you know,
contents on animal.

432
00:18:36,301 --> 00:18:39,780
He's a real fucking killer.
That guys is straight killer.

433
00:18:39,900 --> 00:18:42,330
What he said in that countdown show was 
bad ass.

434
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:47,480
He goes,
I want the rest of the referee to 

435
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:49,041
rescue.
I want the referee to come in and save 

436
00:18:49,041 --> 00:18:49,041
your life.
Save your fucking life,

437
00:18:49,041 --> 00:18:53,331
man.
And that's the way to do things like 

438
00:18:53,331 --> 00:18:53,331
that.
That that's a killer man.

439
00:18:53,331 --> 00:18:54,030
I mean,
if he wasn't doing this,

440
00:18:54,090 --> 00:18:57,590
he would be somewhere working for the 
military that I wrote.

441
00:18:57,640 --> 00:18:58,780
I always said that about him.

442
00:18:59,010 --> 00:19:00,850
He's a killer.
He's a fucking kill him.

443
00:19:00,851 --> 00:19:02,970
And that natural born killer.
That's not just a nickname.

444
00:19:03,150 --> 00:19:05,280
You know,
you can talk all that tough Guy Shit you

445
00:19:05,281 --> 00:19:10,281
want.
What happens when you actually get in 

446
00:19:10,281 --> 00:19:12,471
there and you're throwing down when that
guy is actually in there and he's 

447
00:19:12,471 --> 00:19:13,170
throwing down,
he's a fucking stone cold killer.

448
00:19:13,290 --> 00:19:15,990
They both are.
They're both stone cold killers.

449
00:19:16,140 --> 00:19:21,140
Neither guy is going to be scared of the
other guy and both guys are going to be 

450
00:19:21,140 --> 00:19:21,690
just going in there ready to just let it
all hang out.

451
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:23,610
This is going to be a crazy weekend.

452
00:19:27,050 --> 00:19:32,050
I wish I wasn't working.
I wish I fucking get Kenny Florian to 

453
00:19:32,050 --> 00:19:32,050
fill in.
I want to get hammered.

454
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:33,800
Sit Cage summit.
I'm going to take.

455
00:19:34,570 --> 00:19:36,930
It would be an honor to to call this 
fight.

456
00:19:36,931 --> 00:19:41,931
Don't get me wrong,
but there's fights like that where I 

457
00:19:41,931 --> 00:19:41,931
wish I could just go.
Oh,

458
00:19:41,931 --> 00:19:42,720
got you.
Gosh.

459
00:19:42,790 --> 00:19:44,130
Checking my peers.
Yeah.

460
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:46,440
Oh yeah,
you kidding me,

461
00:19:46,441 --> 00:19:47,510
man.
Both peers.

462
00:19:48,050 --> 00:19:49,740
Peers is dangerous for everybody.
Here's why.

463
00:19:49,770 --> 00:19:52,140
He's one of those guys that eventually 
he's going to catch on.

464
00:19:52,270 --> 00:19:57,270
You know,
eventually pierce is going to hit his 

465
00:19:57,270 --> 00:19:57,270
stride and he is going to be Johnny 
Hendricks and dudes.

466
00:19:57,270 --> 00:20:01,520
You know,
like Johnny Hendricks just took out 

467
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:03,231
finch.
There's his wrestler dudes that are 

468
00:20:03,231 --> 00:20:05,301
just.
They're striking is slowly getting 

469
00:20:05,301 --> 00:20:05,301
better,
slowly getting better,

470
00:20:05,301 --> 00:20:09,711
but the power's always there.
It's just a matter of figuring out how 

471
00:20:09,711 --> 00:20:09,780
to put face to face and they're getting 
better at it.

472
00:20:09,780 --> 00:20:10,860
And Johnny Hendricks,
man,

473
00:20:10,861 --> 00:20:13,140
the way he put out John Fitch like that 
with one punch,

474
00:20:13,620 --> 00:20:18,620
I'll tell you what,
Johnny Hendricks hits anybody with that 

475
00:20:18,620 --> 00:20:19,500
punch.
Anybody and your Foxville fucked.

476
00:20:19,590 --> 00:20:24,590
That guy hits really hard.
There's some guys who watch them hit 

477
00:20:24,590 --> 00:20:24,590
dudes in the cage and you know,
you know,

478
00:20:24,590 --> 00:20:25,170
you say,
well,

479
00:20:25,171 --> 00:20:26,160
hey,
that's a strong guy.

480
00:20:26,161 --> 00:20:28,320
That's an athletic guy.
Hendrix is one of those guys.

481
00:20:28,321 --> 00:20:30,930
He's got that extra.
There's an extra.

482
00:20:31,410 --> 00:20:33,810
There's some dudes when they hit you,
you hear it.

483
00:20:33,811 --> 00:20:38,811
When you hear them hit the bag,
you know you're not ever knowing when 

484
00:20:38,811 --> 00:20:38,811
you hit it.
I hit the bag and they go,

485
00:20:38,811 --> 00:20:40,500
this motherfucker's got that extra pop 
to it.

486
00:20:40,830 --> 00:20:44,340
That's what Hendrix has gotten you here.
The have that or you don't have that.

487
00:20:44,460 --> 00:20:49,460
I mean,
you can certainly make your punching 

488
00:20:49,460 --> 00:20:51,021
power better.
You certainly build your muscles up a 

489
00:20:51,021 --> 00:20:53,311
bit,
put some weight on learning how to turn 

490
00:20:53,311 --> 00:20:53,311
your body into things better.

491
00:20:53,311 --> 00:20:56,370
But some dudes just know how to throw 
and that Hendrix cat knows how to throw 

492
00:20:56,370 --> 00:20:56,370
and sodas.
Pierce,

493
00:20:56,370 --> 00:20:58,060
he knows how to fuck.
Especially that left hook.

494
00:20:58,090 --> 00:21:03,090
Oh,
who he's got power and cost check to 

495
00:21:03,090 --> 00:21:03,280
man.
Caustic is dangerous as fuck man.

496
00:21:03,490 --> 00:21:04,410
That man,
he was fight.

497
00:21:04,420 --> 00:21:06,520
That was,
that was a brutal assassination man.

498
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:07,450
You know,
that was a,

499
00:21:07,451 --> 00:21:12,451
it was a brutal ending to that fight.
Which you kind of knew what was gonna 

500
00:21:12,451 --> 00:21:12,451
happen stylistically.
You like,

501
00:21:12,451 --> 00:21:16,531
well here's two really good wrestlers,
but one of them had stupid knockout 

502
00:21:16,531 --> 00:21:17,980
power and the other one you know,
has been knocked out a few times.

503
00:21:17,981 --> 00:21:22,981
It's not,
it's not the best stylistic matchup for 

504
00:21:22,981 --> 00:21:22,981
Hughes.
You know,

505
00:21:22,981 --> 00:21:23,980
now he's going to fight again.
Who's looking for another fight?

506
00:21:23,981 --> 00:21:26,650
Hughes man,
he's an hoists gracie.

507
00:21:26,651 --> 00:21:27,790
They should make that happen,
man.

508
00:21:28,390 --> 00:21:30,060
He'll kill hoists.
That doesn't matter.

509
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:31,210
It's good rematch.

510
00:21:31,210 --> 00:21:33,580
Hoy's wants it really bad.
No matter what happens.

511
00:21:33,810 --> 00:21:36,460
If I shouldn't be,
I shouldn't say always because you never

512
00:21:36,461 --> 00:21:41,461
know.
What the fuck is gonna happen and who's 

513
00:21:41,461 --> 00:21:41,461
great.
She's a legend,

514
00:21:41,461 --> 00:21:41,461
but based on that first fight,
I would hate to see that again,

515
00:21:41,461 --> 00:21:45,540
unless there was something wrong with it
is he's claiming he was sick or 

516
00:21:45,540 --> 00:21:45,540
something.
I don't know who he.

517
00:21:45,540 --> 00:21:49,060
His voice is an all time great.
He's the original legend.

518
00:21:49,061 --> 00:21:51,880
He was the first Jujitsu Guy,
the first guy to show the world.

519
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,160
If it wasn't for him,
I would have never known.

520
00:21:54,370 --> 00:21:59,370
None of us would have ever known if it 
wasn't for his accomplishments in the 

521
00:21:59,370 --> 00:21:59,370
ultimate fighting championship.
None of us would have ever known,

522
00:21:59,530 --> 00:22:01,930
but that was a long fucking time ago.
You know,

523
00:22:01,931 --> 00:22:06,931
and errors.
They pass for reason and at a certain 

524
00:22:06,931 --> 00:22:09,841
point in time,
your body just has not moved the same 

525
00:22:09,841 --> 00:22:09,841
anymore.

526
00:22:09,841 --> 00:22:12,900
You know,
and the world passes you by and when 

527
00:22:12,900 --> 00:22:12,900
that happens,
you got to step aside,

528
00:22:12,900 --> 00:22:12,900
man,
you got to step aside.

529
00:22:12,900 --> 00:22:15,730
You can't just be going out there and 
getting knocked out all the time and get

530
00:22:15,731 --> 00:22:18,670
hurt all the time because it's just,
it's just reality.

531
00:22:18,790 --> 00:22:19,570
You know,
reality.

532
00:22:19,571 --> 00:22:24,571
There's a certain point in time where 
all of us are going to be dust band and 

533
00:22:24,571 --> 00:22:27,541
the only way this sport really works is 
that we stop people from competing when 

534
00:22:27,791 --> 00:22:30,010
they hit that point because they don't 
believe it.

535
00:22:30,100 --> 00:22:32,680
The same thing that makes someone,
a great fighter make someone say,

536
00:22:32,681 --> 00:22:33,610
no,
you're all wrong.

537
00:22:33,611 --> 00:22:38,611
I'm going to prove the world.
I'm going to go out and one more time 

538
00:22:38,611 --> 00:22:38,611
I'm making a comeback that.
But that's,

539
00:22:38,611 --> 00:22:40,270
that's how guys get fucked up.
But they got to decide for themselves.

540
00:22:40,271 --> 00:22:41,630
A voice wants to fight.
I want to.

541
00:22:41,650 --> 00:22:44,500
I would love to see Hoist Matt Hughes.
He wants it.

542
00:22:44,740 --> 00:22:46,420
If Matt huge wants,
wants another fight.

543
00:22:46,421 --> 00:22:48,670
That's a great remark.
What if you got them mad?

544
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:50,620
What if he was good on his back?
Just like before.

545
00:22:50,690 --> 00:22:55,690
That'd be bombing them in the head.
Dean would come in and stop it at the 

546
00:22:55,690 --> 00:22:55,840
perfect time.
I don't know,

547
00:22:55,841 --> 00:22:58,330
man.
I don't want to watch that fight again.

548
00:22:58,331 --> 00:23:00,910
I don't want to watch what happens.
I love voice too much,

549
00:23:00,911 --> 00:23:01,960
man.
I love that guy.

550
00:23:01,961 --> 00:23:03,790
I think he's like I said,
he's a legend.

551
00:23:03,791 --> 00:23:05,380
He said he's not going to get killed.
They'll tap.

552
00:23:06,140 --> 00:23:11,140
I don't want to.
I want to see him fighting that in the 

553
00:23:11,140 --> 00:23:14,320
end.
Unless there was something really wrong 

554
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:14,320
with them and unless he's different now.
I.

555
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:15,160
You want it really bad.
I think that's good enough.

556
00:23:15,630 --> 00:23:17,080
You know?
Who else wants Hughes?

557
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:18,550
Who Your boy?

558
00:23:19,080 --> 00:23:21,160
Mike Hardy.
Oh Shit.

559
00:23:21,190 --> 00:23:26,190
Damn hard,
he's been calling them out and hard to 

560
00:23:26,190 --> 00:23:26,190
do a good fight to him.
Apparently.

561
00:23:26,190 --> 00:23:26,190
That'd be a good fight.
Yeah.

562
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:29,230
You don't think it'd be able to take Dan
hardee down fairly easily.

563
00:23:30,180 --> 00:23:32,420
Oh,
Dan's worked really hard on his rest.

564
00:23:32,950 --> 00:23:37,950
I'm assuming he's working like day and 
night on takedown defense and diffuse 

565
00:23:38,840 --> 00:23:41,800
goes back to the way he was wrestling 
when he was at his peak.

566
00:23:41,830 --> 00:23:42,790
I mean,
if that's possible,

567
00:23:42,791 --> 00:23:44,440
if his body can still do that,
man,

568
00:23:45,380 --> 00:23:47,970
remember those days,
like the saccharide days when you,

569
00:23:47,980 --> 00:23:52,980
you know,
people forget how dominant that 

570
00:23:52,980 --> 00:23:52,980
motherfucker was.
You know,

571
00:23:52,980 --> 00:23:52,980
he was dominant man.
He was like,

572
00:23:52,980 --> 00:23:56,180
one of the first dominant wrestler is 
actually that learned submissions too,

573
00:23:56,450 --> 00:23:59,810
so he wouldn't just beat you up.
He started strangling guys taken back.

574
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:02,340
He started getting armbars frank trigg.
Fuck Ya.

575
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:05,870
Beat him twice.
Twice with a rear naked choke the second

576
00:24:05,871 --> 00:24:07,280
time after he got kicked in the balls.

577
00:24:07,690 --> 00:24:09,010
Yep.
Those were great memories.

578
00:24:09,040 --> 00:24:11,270
Picked him up and walk them across 
after.

579
00:24:11,271 --> 00:24:13,370
After Frank trigg was bombing on them.
Frank Trigg,

580
00:24:13,371 --> 00:24:18,371
God is back and it looked bad,
but frank trigg does not know how to 

581
00:24:18,371 --> 00:24:21,551
finish that joke,
his know how to defend or finish and 

582
00:24:21,551 --> 00:24:24,821
that he was picked him up,
walked into the middle of the fucking 

583
00:24:24,821 --> 00:24:24,821
cage and threw him against the ground.
It was awesome,

584
00:24:24,821 --> 00:24:25,610
man.
It was awesome.

585
00:24:25,611 --> 00:24:29,660
That was like one of the best moments 
like mma moments come from behind,

586
00:24:29,810 --> 00:24:31,490
you know,
from being stuck,

587
00:24:31,670 --> 00:24:34,250
got kicks you in the balls,
hit you with a bunch of shots,

588
00:24:34,370 --> 00:24:39,370
takes your back and this is that in a 
rematch of a fight where you fucked him 

589
00:24:39,370 --> 00:24:40,670
up in the first fight and he didn't want
to fight him in the second fight anyway,

590
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:44,900
and then he starts winning and then he 
was just mustered all up and turn it all

591
00:24:44,901 --> 00:24:45,260
around.

592
00:24:45,410 --> 00:24:47,960
That was amazing.
That was some amazing shit.

593
00:24:48,130 --> 00:24:53,130
Yeah.
Some good high guard action in that 

594
00:24:53,130 --> 00:24:53,130
fight as well.
Seeing that a guy like he was.

595
00:24:53,130 --> 00:24:55,580
I mean I think he uses a great fighter,
but I think a certain,

596
00:24:55,640 --> 00:25:00,640
a certain number of knockouts,
the they have to step in and stop you 

597
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:01,550
from doing that.
Whether it's your family,

598
00:25:01,551 --> 00:25:03,020
whether it's your friends,
whether it's,

599
00:25:03,021 --> 00:25:04,040
you know,
your boss,

600
00:25:04,280 --> 00:25:05,940
there's a certain amount of times,
you know,

601
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:07,450
I've talked to a,
there's a,

602
00:25:07,451 --> 00:25:12,451
a guy that I know very well who is a 
brain is a traumatic brain injury 

603
00:25:12,951 --> 00:25:17,420
specialist and what he deals with is 
rehabilitating people and um,

604
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:22,840
and helping people like with all these 
mental imbalances that people have due 

605
00:25:22,840 --> 00:25:27,701
to traumatic brain injuries.
One of the things that happens is your 

606
00:25:27,701 --> 00:25:28,610
body stops producing testosterone.
You get really lethargic,

607
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:33,760
you get depressed.
Like that happens to a lot of guys that 

608
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:33,760
have a bunch of head injuries.

609
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:37,660
They get depressed.
The apparently your brain can only take 

610
00:25:37,660 --> 00:25:39,530
like a few concussions in your life who 
needs to retire right now,

611
00:25:39,650 --> 00:25:44,650
who,
I would never tell any of them to 

612
00:25:44,650 --> 00:25:44,660
retire.
But there's a few dudes that I would,

613
00:25:44,690 --> 00:25:47,000
I would pull aside and I would say,
you know,

614
00:25:47,030 --> 00:25:48,800
think about this a little bit.
You know,

615
00:25:49,050 --> 00:25:51,110
who I don't want to say because I'm in 
my position,

616
00:25:51,140 --> 00:25:52,310
you know,
being a commentator.

617
00:25:52,730 --> 00:25:53,630
But there's,
there's a lot of,

618
00:25:53,631 --> 00:25:53,990
um,
any,

619
00:25:53,991 --> 00:25:55,910
any dudes who have been knocked out a 
gang of times,

620
00:25:55,970 --> 00:25:58,550
but there's guys that violate that shit.
Like Alistair Overeem,

621
00:25:58,760 --> 00:26:01,040
Alistair overeem been stopped a bunch of
times.

622
00:26:01,041 --> 00:26:03,350
Dude,
he's been knocked out a gang of times.

623
00:26:03,380 --> 00:26:04,970
How many times?
A lot.

624
00:26:05,270 --> 00:26:08,180
I would bet he's been stopped at least 
eight times.

625
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:09,530
Damn.
Yeah.

626
00:26:10,250 --> 00:26:11,120
Yeah,
he's been.

627
00:26:11,540 --> 00:26:13,100
Chuck knocked him out.
Okay.

628
00:26:13,101 --> 00:26:15,230
Badr.
Hari knocked him out in,

629
00:26:15,231 --> 00:26:15,710
in,
in,

630
00:26:15,711 --> 00:26:16,820
in kickboxing.

631
00:26:17,150 --> 00:26:22,150
Um,
what does that big dude that used to 

632
00:26:22,150 --> 00:26:22,150
fight king of the cage?
Real angry guy.

633
00:26:22,580 --> 00:26:23,660
Hoffman.
Bob Hoffman.

634
00:26:23,661 --> 00:26:26,250
Bob Hoffman knocked them out.
How about Bobby Hoffman?

635
00:26:26,251 --> 00:26:29,330
K Odem.
I'm Shogun Kod.

636
00:26:29,331 --> 00:26:32,510
I'm,
I believe I'm a bunch of dudes.

637
00:26:32,511 --> 00:26:33,830
Stopped him at a bar.
Oh,

638
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:35,780
Keratan off.
Knocked him out.

639
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:39,770
A bunch of dudes stopped overeem.
But overeem figured it out,

640
00:26:39,771 --> 00:26:41,360
man.
And one of the things he figured out,

641
00:26:41,361 --> 00:26:44,010
he was just too fucking small.
He was too small at two.

642
00:26:44,011 --> 00:26:44,910
Oh five.
You know,

643
00:26:45,210 --> 00:26:47,130
when he moved up to heavyweight.
But then again,

644
00:26:47,131 --> 00:26:49,470
Keratan a pink Keratan of Jack intimate 
heavyweight.

645
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:50,520
He started,
you know,

646
00:26:50,521 --> 00:26:52,350
I don't what,
what changed in him?

647
00:26:52,351 --> 00:26:54,690
Man,
what changed his ultimate dedication?

648
00:26:54,691 --> 00:26:57,580
What changed in his intensity?
What would change,

649
00:26:57,581 --> 00:26:59,910
but no one's ever turned it around like 
overeem.

650
00:27:00,150 --> 00:27:04,110
No one's ever gone from being stopped 
like eight times and you know,

651
00:27:04,380 --> 00:27:05,520
back when he was fighting at two.

652
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:06,750
Oh five.
As you know,

653
00:27:06,751 --> 00:27:08,610
in mma,
he was thought of is,

654
00:27:08,611 --> 00:27:09,930
you know,
a tough guy,

655
00:27:09,931 --> 00:27:11,670
a tough guy,
but a guy who would gas out,

656
00:27:11,910 --> 00:27:16,910
he goes from that to be the first guy to
win a world title in both MMA andK ,

657
00:27:18,730 --> 00:27:20,880
one kickboxing.
No one's ever done that before.

658
00:27:20,970 --> 00:27:25,970
No one,
everyone that k one Grand Prix and one 

659
00:27:25,970 --> 00:27:27,630
in mma title and looks like that.
You know who the fuck looks like?

660
00:27:27,631 --> 00:27:30,510
Alistair overeem means the Goddamn 
Superhero in a comic book.

661
00:27:30,750 --> 00:27:33,480
He turned it around.
So when you got a guy like that,

662
00:27:33,660 --> 00:27:35,100
you kind of can't say anything.
You know,

663
00:27:35,101 --> 00:27:36,870
you look at Mirko Cro cop and you go,
man,

664
00:27:36,871 --> 00:27:38,730
I love Cro cop.
He's a legend.

665
00:27:38,731 --> 00:27:40,890
He's got one of the greatest highlight 
reels of all time.

666
00:27:40,891 --> 00:27:43,560
Those head kick knockouts,
one after the other,

667
00:27:43,620 --> 00:27:48,620
but at a certain point in time,
how many times can cro cop get knocked 

668
00:27:48,620 --> 00:27:48,620
out before someone doesn't want to,
you know,

669
00:27:48,630 --> 00:27:50,070
you feel bad for them,
you know,

670
00:27:50,090 --> 00:27:55,090
you know what's amazing,
the alertness of the whole concussion 

671
00:27:55,090 --> 00:27:55,320
thing,
like everybody's hip to it now.

672
00:27:55,320 --> 00:28:00,320
Like I was watching 60 minutes Tuesday 
night and they interviewed Roger 

673
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:00,320
Goodell,
the,

674
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:04,530
the whatever,
the NFL and a Monday he reviews tapes to

675
00:28:04,531 --> 00:28:09,180
see who gets concussions and they showed
a guy hitting another guy,

676
00:28:09,181 --> 00:28:14,181
like a wide receiver getting hit by a 
defensive back and he pointed to the 

677
00:28:14,181 --> 00:28:17,070
defensive back getting the concussion.
It stayed in the fucking game.

678
00:28:17,340 --> 00:28:22,340
So they're finding them know if they.
They stay in the fucking game with a 

679
00:28:22,340 --> 00:28:24,120
concussion because you know,
you don't want to go to fuck out.

680
00:28:24,121 --> 00:28:25,740
You're rocking your plane.
You know what I'm saying?

681
00:28:25,741 --> 00:28:30,741
So you don't even feel it,
but it's amazing how the guys are 

682
00:28:30,741 --> 00:28:33,710
standing voluntarily.
So who the fuck are you to tell a 

683
00:28:33,710 --> 00:28:38,060
dangerous man?
It's really dangerous in the football 

684
00:28:38,060 --> 00:28:40,671
players.
They're finding out now you know these 

685
00:28:40,671 --> 00:28:40,671
guys,
by the time they even get to college,

686
00:28:40,671 --> 00:28:41,100
a lot of them are fucked up.

687
00:28:41,100 --> 00:28:42,900
That dude who remember that dude who 
died,

688
00:28:43,140 --> 00:28:48,140
henry something.
Henry died in a back of a pickup truck 

689
00:28:48,140 --> 00:28:51,780
filled football player really recently.
Do you don't know what I'm talking 

690
00:28:51,780 --> 00:28:52,110
about?
Him and his girlfriend were arguing.

691
00:28:52,111 --> 00:28:54,420
He jumped in the back of a pickup truck 
and try to google that shit.

692
00:28:54,421 --> 00:28:55,080
Brian,
if he can.

693
00:28:55,110 --> 00:28:57,420
Henry something.
Henry football player,

694
00:28:57,421 --> 00:28:59,910
dead pickup truck.
Anyway,

695
00:28:59,940 --> 00:29:01,740
the dude died.
Don't dump about Olin.

696
00:29:01,980 --> 00:29:04,620
The dude died and he was only 28.
I think they.

697
00:29:04,621 --> 00:29:06,840
They checked out his brain and the brain
of like an old man,

698
00:29:06,870 --> 00:29:08,190
it was.
His brain was all fucked up.

699
00:29:08,191 --> 00:29:11,320
His brand showed massive damage because 
he had been kod.

700
00:29:11,340 --> 00:29:13,890
Who knows how many times.
By the time he got to the pros,

701
00:29:14,220 --> 00:29:17,940
you get killed in high school.
You get out and junior high school.

702
00:29:18,030 --> 00:29:22,800
I talked to a dude who had a fucking 11 
year old son and his 11 year old son got

703
00:29:22,801 --> 00:29:27,150
knocked out for a half an hour and they 
put them back in a month later,

704
00:29:27,180 --> 00:29:29,040
a month later that kids playing football
game and I'm like,

705
00:29:29,041 --> 00:29:32,370
you're crazy.
What are my students got knocked out?

706
00:29:32,490 --> 00:29:34,410
And Chris Henry.
Chris Henry.

707
00:29:34,411 --> 00:29:35,590
Yeah.
Yeah.

708
00:29:35,620 --> 00:29:38,550
That was his story.
He doesn't say anything about his brain.

709
00:29:38,660 --> 00:29:43,060
A Cincinnati bengals football player.
Chris Henry died after he fell.

710
00:29:43,180 --> 00:29:46,330
Hold on after he fell.

711
00:29:47,670 --> 00:29:49,110
Oh Shit.
It just went away.

712
00:29:50,990 --> 00:29:51,660
Um,

713
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:54,300
he fell off the back of a pickup.
The back of the APP.

714
00:29:54,390 --> 00:29:55,020
Pickup truck.

715
00:29:57,160 --> 00:29:58,690
Fuck man.
These guys,

716
00:29:58,691 --> 00:30:03,691
man,
they don't realize a lot of people they 

717
00:30:03,691 --> 00:30:03,691
had no idea.
So they would just throw in these people

718
00:30:03,691 --> 00:30:04,840
back in,
over and over and over again.

719
00:30:05,170 --> 00:30:06,430
And now they're starting to put it 
together.

720
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:07,390
When you went over there,
Joey,

721
00:30:08,500 --> 00:30:10,100
what are you doing?
Chicken soda.

722
00:30:11,280 --> 00:30:16,280
Well,
one of my guys got knocked out last 

723
00:30:16,280 --> 00:30:16,280
weekend and the amateur show and he 
wasn't knocked out completely.

724
00:30:16,410 --> 00:30:21,410
It was controversial.
Almost like the rest stop that it could 

725
00:30:21,410 --> 00:30:21,410
have.
It was on the fence,

726
00:30:21,410 --> 00:30:25,791
whether it was early or not.
He got up right away and was 

727
00:30:25,791 --> 00:30:25,830
complaining.
He was never out,

728
00:30:25,860 --> 00:30:28,590
but he was like a little rock.
I didn't complain about the stoppage.

729
00:30:28,591 --> 00:30:29,790
It looked.
It looked legit.

730
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:34,880
He got rock standing and then got taken 
down a couple of ground and pound 

731
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:34,890
against the cage.
He never was out,

732
00:30:34,920 --> 00:30:37,650
popped up.
By the time we got backstage,

733
00:30:37,980 --> 00:30:42,980
by the end he sat down.
He didn't remember anything about the 

734
00:30:42,980 --> 00:30:42,980
fight.
Not One.

735
00:30:43,010 --> 00:30:45,600
I don't remember anything about the day.
He wasn't even out though.

736
00:30:45,630 --> 00:30:50,630
That's the crazy thing.
He wasn't even out and he doesn't 

737
00:30:50,630 --> 00:30:50,630
remember.
He didn't remember the name of the hotel

738
00:30:50,630 --> 00:30:50,630
we were in.
Well,

739
00:30:50,630 --> 00:30:53,700
you remember when we saw Tim Sylvia,
we were in the hotel bar.

740
00:30:53,700 --> 00:30:57,060
We're waiting to get our car to the 
airport and it was the next day after he

741
00:30:57,061 --> 00:31:02,061
fought randy coture,
he fought five rounds against randy and 

742
00:31:02,061 --> 00:31:02,370
lost his title and he came up to us and 
he goes,

743
00:31:02,371 --> 00:31:02,760
dude.
He goes,

744
00:31:02,761 --> 00:31:04,710
I don't even remember the fight.
And he goes,

745
00:31:04,711 --> 00:31:05,240
uh,
I,

746
00:31:05,250 --> 00:31:06,560
I remember the,
the,

747
00:31:06,680 --> 00:31:11,680
the bell ringing.
And then I remember sitting in the 

748
00:31:11,680 --> 00:31:11,680
corner asking,
uh,

749
00:31:11,680 --> 00:31:12,960
my corner,
what rounded was,

750
00:31:12,961 --> 00:31:15,000
and now it's the last round.
And he's like,

751
00:31:15,001 --> 00:31:20,001
what the last round,
like you just fought five rounds on 

752
00:31:20,001 --> 00:31:20,460
instinct.
He had no idea what happened.

753
00:31:20,550 --> 00:31:25,550
He got hit with one righthand early in 
the fight and just had no idea what 

754
00:31:25,550 --> 00:31:25,550
happened.

755
00:31:25,550 --> 00:31:25,550
Wow.

756
00:31:25,550 --> 00:31:27,110
Yeah,
that's what you don't.

757
00:31:27,320 --> 00:31:28,570
We don't.
You know what,

758
00:31:28,600 --> 00:31:32,720
that's why it drives me crazy when 
someone would call a fighter a pussy.

759
00:31:32,930 --> 00:31:33,580
Oh,
this guy,

760
00:31:33,581 --> 00:31:35,270
you know,
he never brings you the fights.

761
00:31:35,271 --> 00:31:37,080
Like a wet blanket.
You go get your,

762
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:39,290
you get your fucking brains rearrange 
Sun.

763
00:31:39,470 --> 00:31:41,810
You get someone shit and kicking you up 
the side of the head.

764
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:47,080
You know,
there's a lot of guys like criticized 

765
00:31:47,080 --> 00:31:47,080
guides for being boring.
You know,

766
00:31:47,080 --> 00:31:47,400
it doesn't bother me at all.
I don't,

767
00:31:47,470 --> 00:31:49,850
I mean maybe I don't necessarily want to
see them,

768
00:31:49,851 --> 00:31:53,400
but I respect what they're doing.
I respect like,

769
00:31:53,510 --> 00:31:55,970
like Antonio Mckey,
a lot of guys give him a lot of shit,

770
00:31:56,030 --> 00:31:57,260
you know,
because he,

771
00:31:57,380 --> 00:31:59,480
you know,
he kinda like wrestled to the ground.

772
00:31:59,481 --> 00:32:04,481
He never never gets into standup 
exchanges with guys too much and it 

773
00:32:04,481 --> 00:32:04,481
doesn't take any damage,
but that's the key.

774
00:32:04,481 --> 00:32:05,750
He doesn't take any damage.
Yeah.

775
00:32:05,751 --> 00:32:07,160
Might not be the most exciting thing in 
the world,

776
00:32:07,161 --> 00:32:08,840
but if you want to fight,
that's really.

777
00:32:08,841 --> 00:32:10,370
That's a smart way to fight,
man.

778
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:13,190
Smartly.
If you just closed a closed shop,

779
00:32:13,220 --> 00:32:13,880
clothes,
everything,

780
00:32:14,330 --> 00:32:16,190
there'll be no punching that we know 
nothing.

781
00:32:16,191 --> 00:32:21,191
There'll be you on your back and be 
punching you a little bit here and 

782
00:32:21,191 --> 00:32:23,561
again,
but nothing crazy because I don't want 

783
00:32:23,561 --> 00:32:23,561
to get submitted and then I'll win every
fight.

784
00:32:23,790 --> 00:32:24,560
You know,
it's,

785
00:32:24,620 --> 00:32:26,980
it's not the smartest way to do it 
because it's a,

786
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:29,570
it's a sport and you're also marketing 
yourself.

787
00:32:29,571 --> 00:32:31,400
It's entertainment,
but I understand that.

788
00:32:31,401 --> 00:32:32,740
I'll never call one of those guys are 
pushing.

789
00:32:32,750 --> 00:32:33,920
It's a smart way to fight,
man.

790
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:37,190
What'd you think of these fighters?
Last weekend was tough match ups,

791
00:32:37,191 --> 00:32:38,230
you know,
first of all,

792
00:32:38,231 --> 00:32:43,231
uh,
the Damien Maia fight Weidman do cut a 

793
00:32:43,231 --> 00:32:43,231
shitload of weight.

794
00:32:43,231 --> 00:32:44,710
He took that fight on 11 days notice and
you could tell when he was in there,

795
00:32:44,740 --> 00:32:45,620
he,
he struggled.

796
00:32:45,770 --> 00:32:48,260
And even Ray Longo gave it away in the 
corner.

797
00:32:48,470 --> 00:32:49,650
Ray Longo said,
you know,

798
00:32:49,790 --> 00:32:52,220
I saw what you went through yesterday.
I saw what you did yesterday,

799
00:32:52,221 --> 00:32:53,870
you can do this.
They said that his,

800
00:32:53,871 --> 00:32:56,400
his cut was horrific,
but he,

801
00:32:56,450 --> 00:32:59,210
that kid is so fucking tough.
He just did it.

802
00:32:59,211 --> 00:33:01,940
And he went out there and he grinded on 
Maya and he wanted a decision.

803
00:33:02,120 --> 00:33:05,060
But you could tell by the end of the 
first round he was dead.

804
00:33:05,061 --> 00:33:06,920
He was dead walking.
And My,

805
00:33:06,921 --> 00:33:10,010
uh,
luckily for him was dead to Maya Look,

806
00:33:10,160 --> 00:33:15,160
look like really?
Like I heard he had a flu or something 

807
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:16,130
like earlier in the week.
He did not look good either.

808
00:33:16,340 --> 00:33:17,690
So both guys,
it was a,

809
00:33:17,780 --> 00:33:19,760
it was a real endurance issue,
you know,

810
00:33:19,790 --> 00:33:22,790
like I was talking to Jeremy Piven at 
Germany and was like laughing about it,

811
00:33:23,050 --> 00:33:24,680
know,
because I didn't interview them and he's

812
00:33:24,681 --> 00:33:26,240
like,
would you have said to them?

813
00:33:26,360 --> 00:33:31,360
So it's safe to say endurance was an 
issue in this fight because it really 

814
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:32,240
was like,
it was kind of,

815
00:33:32,330 --> 00:33:37,330
you know,
it wasn't the best fight to showcase 

816
00:33:37,330 --> 00:33:37,330
mma,
you know,

817
00:33:37,330 --> 00:33:41,980
but it was just a circumstantial 
situation is nothing you could do about 

818
00:33:41,980 --> 00:33:44,711
it.
You got one guy was a fucking stud 

819
00:33:44,711 --> 00:33:46,691
wrestler with all this God potential 
that Chris Weidman could be the king of 

820
00:33:46,691 --> 00:33:49,811
the world someday.
He could be the John Jones of 185 

821
00:33:49,811 --> 00:33:49,811
pounds.
He's a,

822
00:33:49,811 --> 00:33:50,510
he's a beast.
He's a wicked wrestler.

823
00:33:50,600 --> 00:33:55,600
He puts guys to sleep.
You put Tom Laurdis leap with that 

824
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:55,670
fucking darce choke.
He's nasty man.

825
00:33:55,671 --> 00:33:59,510
He's strong as fuck.
I saw him fight Galvao in Abi Dhabi.

826
00:33:59,690 --> 00:34:01,850
He avoided everything and he got golf 
vowel in a fucking.

827
00:34:01,940 --> 00:34:04,730
Doris didn't tap him,
but the fact that he was able to sink it

828
00:34:04,731 --> 00:34:07,010
in and lock it up and had galvao 
fighting to,

829
00:34:07,180 --> 00:34:07,700
to,
you know,

830
00:34:07,830 --> 00:34:11,150
to,
to get his legs under him and to defend.

831
00:34:11,570 --> 00:34:13,730
Pretty fucking impressive for a dude as 
a wrestler.

832
00:34:13,840 --> 00:34:18,840
I mean,
I don't know what is Brazilian Jujitsu 

833
00:34:18,840 --> 00:34:18,840
rank is,
but he's one of those kids that,

834
00:34:18,840 --> 00:34:20,480
you know,
he's really fucking strong willed,

835
00:34:20,630 --> 00:34:22,430
really smart,
and he's just a winner.

836
00:34:22,550 --> 00:34:24,080
There's some dudes that are just 
winters,

837
00:34:24,081 --> 00:34:26,030
man.
They could have a torn meniscus,

838
00:34:26,031 --> 00:34:28,490
they can have a fucking herniated disc.
They take you down anyway.

839
00:34:28,640 --> 00:34:33,640
They take you down.
Anyone they still strangle you while 

840
00:34:33,640 --> 00:34:35,441
they're in pain.
There's dudes that can just force force 

841
00:34:35,441 --> 00:34:35,480
through shit like that.
And that's Weidman's one of those,

842
00:34:35,481 --> 00:34:36,620
man,
he's a fucking animal.

843
00:34:37,100 --> 00:34:39,200
And then Damien Maia,
you don't want to think about my man.

844
00:34:39,201 --> 00:34:44,201
He's in limbo right now because my at 
one point in time was just taken 

845
00:34:44,201 --> 00:34:47,641
everybody down and strangled them.
He was all Jujitsu and that's when 

846
00:34:47,641 --> 00:34:47,641
everybody loved him.
He was nasty,

847
00:34:47,641 --> 00:34:49,760
but somewhere along the line he figured,
you know what,

848
00:34:49,930 --> 00:34:51,470
these nate Marquardt,
these guys,

849
00:34:51,471 --> 00:34:52,460
I can't take down.

850
00:34:52,460 --> 00:34:55,280
They beat the fuck out of me standing.
I got to get my stand up better.

851
00:34:55,430 --> 00:34:58,280
But in doing that,
his Jujitsu is just not the same.

852
00:34:58,281 --> 00:34:59,840
It's not what it used to be.
You know,

853
00:34:59,841 --> 00:35:02,750
he submitted to jail sonnet and he 
submitted at Herman.

854
00:35:02,751 --> 00:35:05,060
He submitted all these guys.
He was strangling people,

855
00:35:05,061 --> 00:35:06,530
man.
And it was nasty when,

856
00:35:06,531 --> 00:35:11,531
when he got you on the ground,
you were Foxville pulled guard on those 

857
00:35:11,531 --> 00:35:15,641
guys.
He refuses to pull gardener Chael 

858
00:35:15,641 --> 00:35:15,641
Sonnen.
He hit it with a fucking lateral drop.

859
00:35:15,641 --> 00:35:17,810
You remember?
I mean he was nasty but.

860
00:35:18,100 --> 00:35:21,560
But his stand up is not good.
He's a mechanical,

861
00:35:21,620 --> 00:35:23,840
like he moves like the whitest guy on 
earth.

862
00:35:24,020 --> 00:35:29,020
You know what I mean?
Like if you look at the way he moves 

863
00:35:29,020 --> 00:35:31,301
around,
he's got like this and he does the same 

864
00:35:31,301 --> 00:35:31,301
thing over and over again.
He paused with the right and then throws

865
00:35:31,301 --> 00:35:32,570
the left pause with the right and then 
throws the left.

866
00:35:32,810 --> 00:35:34,850
It's way too predictable,
you know,

867
00:35:34,851 --> 00:35:36,550
he needs to.
That guy needs to.

868
00:35:36,551 --> 00:35:37,950
If he really wants to work on a stand 
up,

869
00:35:37,951 --> 00:35:42,420
he needs to go to Holland and just hang 
out with tyrone spong for a year.

870
00:35:42,740 --> 00:35:45,360
It just do what that guy does.
Move the way that guy does,

871
00:35:45,361 --> 00:35:46,020
you know,
go,

872
00:35:46,021 --> 00:35:48,120
go train will go con Saki,
go train with,

873
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:50,700
go to Mike's gym and workout with Melvin
manhoef.

874
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:52,520
See the way those guys move,
you gotTa,

875
00:35:52,530 --> 00:35:54,000
move like that.
Imitate them,

876
00:35:54,001 --> 00:35:56,760
move the way they're moving.
Do those kinds of combinations.

877
00:35:56,880 --> 00:35:59,640
Maybe your body doesn't exactly move the
way that body moves,

878
00:35:59,790 --> 00:36:04,790
but try to emulate it.
The best strikers all have a particular 

879
00:36:04,790 --> 00:36:07,050
style like specially kickboxers.
They all have a particular style.

880
00:36:07,051 --> 00:36:09,240
You Watch men who fight,
he moves and he throws,

881
00:36:09,241 --> 00:36:10,760
Fain Tito's feint,
boom,

882
00:36:10,761 --> 00:36:15,630
and he throws kicks.
He's got a very particular way of moving

883
00:36:15,631 --> 00:36:18,720
and that the way of moving is the way of
an elite striker.

884
00:36:18,870 --> 00:36:22,160
You know a dude like when you see it was
that dude's name Shale Sanderson.

885
00:36:22,170 --> 00:36:23,320
You ever see that?
Do a wrestle.

886
00:36:23,770 --> 00:36:26,670
That dude gets low and he moves on 
dudes.

887
00:36:26,730 --> 00:36:29,820
There's guys that you look at them,
you look at the move around on the mat,

888
00:36:29,880 --> 00:36:31,440
you go,
that's a fucking killer.

889
00:36:31,530 --> 00:36:33,540
You know,
like Mark Schultz back in the day,

890
00:36:33,690 --> 00:36:36,810
you would look at Mark Schultz,
move around like that is a killer.

891
00:36:37,110 --> 00:36:41,130
There's a certain way that guy moves you
like that's an elite wrestler,

892
00:36:41,160 --> 00:36:43,050
no doubt about it.
There's a way he hits those,

893
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:44,970
hits those take downs.
It's elite.

894
00:36:45,230 --> 00:36:50,230
You gotta imitate those guys.
You gotta if you want to be a real 

895
00:36:50,230 --> 00:36:53,301
striker,
you got to figure out what those guys 

896
00:36:53,301 --> 00:36:53,301
are doing it,
figure out that style and then do it.

897
00:36:53,301 --> 00:36:57,891
Apply it to mma,
but you've got to imitate the way they 

898
00:36:57,891 --> 00:37:00,321
move.
And right now Damien Maia does not move 

899
00:37:00,321 --> 00:37:01,160
the way those elite strikers move,
you know,

900
00:37:01,230 --> 00:37:02,580
he's so good at Jujitsu.

901
00:37:02,580 --> 00:37:04,470
I know that he could be good at 
everything else,

902
00:37:04,740 --> 00:37:06,210
but it's kind of a leap,
you know,

903
00:37:06,230 --> 00:37:07,570
at 32 years of age,
it's,

904
00:37:07,580 --> 00:37:08,300
it's tricky,
right?

905
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:10,920
How many is about 32?
I'm not sure how old he is,

906
00:37:11,580 --> 00:37:13,170
but I,
I really think that,

907
00:37:13,530 --> 00:37:14,330
that,
um,

908
00:37:14,520 --> 00:37:18,870
him eliminating the pulling guard 
strategy as really hindered his game.

909
00:37:18,871 --> 00:37:23,871
I mean,
there's only three things you can do in 

910
00:37:23,871 --> 00:37:23,871
a fight.
You can fight standing where the dude,

911
00:37:23,871 --> 00:37:26,790
you can try to take the guy down or you 
can pull guard.

912
00:37:27,120 --> 00:37:32,120
That's all you can do.
And Damien Maia always had that third 

913
00:37:32,120 --> 00:37:32,520
option.
Most MMA fighters,

914
00:37:32,521 --> 00:37:35,850
most of you seen fighters don't aren't 
good at that third option,

915
00:37:36,030 --> 00:37:39,510
their guard isn't dangerous enough to 
pull and attack.

916
00:37:39,511 --> 00:37:41,630
Look at Paul Harris,
Paul Harris,

917
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:44,400
that he who?
Who is the guy beat.

918
00:37:44,460 --> 00:37:46,710
They put her in a leg lock.
Oh Mckenzie.

919
00:37:46,711 --> 00:37:47,430
Oh yeah.

920
00:37:47,430 --> 00:37:49,200
That guy.
I'm that guy.

921
00:37:49,201 --> 00:37:51,780
Could have been an Olympic wrestler and 
a k,

922
00:37:51,781 --> 00:37:53,430
one champion.
And Paul,

923
00:37:53,460 --> 00:37:55,920
it didn't matter to Paul Harvey.
He took that out of the equation.

924
00:37:55,980 --> 00:38:00,980
He took us through a little shot and he 
pulled guard and went right after his 

925
00:38:00,980 --> 00:38:02,070
legs.
He bypassed the superior wrestling.

926
00:38:02,071 --> 00:38:05,310
He bypassed the superior striking.
He had the third option.

927
00:38:05,311 --> 00:38:07,140
Most fighters don't have that third 
option.

928
00:38:07,350 --> 00:38:10,980
Damien Maia was one of the few that did 
have the third option.

929
00:38:11,220 --> 00:38:15,180
If he was having trouble on his feet and
he couldn't take the guy down,

930
00:38:15,181 --> 00:38:18,510
which comes up all the time,
having trouble on your feet.

931
00:38:18,570 --> 00:38:21,810
Can't take the dude down.
If you don't have that third option,

932
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:25,890
you're going to just stand up and either
lose a decision or get knocked out.

933
00:38:25,950 --> 00:38:26,670
And,
and that's,

934
00:38:26,760 --> 00:38:29,130
I would love to see Paul Harris and 
Damien Maia.

935
00:38:29,700 --> 00:38:32,390
And remember at the height of Damien 
Maia,

936
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:33,390
he was pulling guard.

937
00:38:33,510 --> 00:38:35,380
He was taking shots.
If he didn't take them down,

938
00:38:35,381 --> 00:38:37,090
he would pull garth.
He would sweep them,

939
00:38:37,091 --> 00:38:40,120
get on top and attack.
He's not doing that no more.

940
00:38:40,121 --> 00:38:41,040
He decided,
some,

941
00:38:41,320 --> 00:38:45,550
someone convinced them that just be a 
striker to stand up,

942
00:38:45,610 --> 00:38:50,610
try to take a guy down there.
So many guys out there that he's not 

943
00:38:50,610 --> 00:38:53,521
going to be able to take down.
And there's so many guys that he's not 

944
00:38:53,521 --> 00:38:54,430
going to be able to strike with Wa 
Weidman.

945
00:38:54,520 --> 00:38:56,220
Yeah.
What are you going to do now?

946
00:38:56,330 --> 00:38:58,180
And you know what he's,
you know,

947
00:38:58,181 --> 00:39:03,181
he was tired and sued for both guys.
Weren't in the best shape for that 

948
00:39:03,181 --> 00:39:06,541
fight.
They both obviously had some sort of 

949
00:39:06,541 --> 00:39:06,541
physical issue.
Would it be didn't if Weidman was at his

950
00:39:06,541 --> 00:39:07,300
best.
It's a terrible fight for him.

951
00:39:07,580 --> 00:39:08,910
It's terrible fight.
He's not going to take the.

952
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:12,250
But if he would have been the old damen 
meier where he would have taken a shot,

953
00:39:12,300 --> 00:39:12,940
you know,
sprawled,

954
00:39:12,980 --> 00:39:13,870
he would've pulled guard.

955
00:39:14,020 --> 00:39:19,020
His guard is dangerous enough in 
submissions and sweeps where he could 

956
00:39:19,020 --> 00:39:20,860
have did something to Weidman,
but he took that out of the equation and

957
00:39:20,930 --> 00:39:25,060
then he decided to kick box with them 
and now all those years of Jujitsu,

958
00:39:25,360 --> 00:39:28,390
he's so good at Jujitsu.
It's not even in the game.

959
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:31,510
It's a kickboxing match.
Why would you do that?

960
00:39:31,830 --> 00:39:33,700
You know,
if you can't take the guy down,

961
00:39:34,330 --> 00:39:39,330
the drag them down.
Otherwise you have to kickbox and my is 

962
00:39:39,330 --> 00:39:42,160
not a kickboxer so stupid.
I look at Paul Harris,

963
00:39:42,190 --> 00:39:43,810
look at bars.
What he did,

964
00:39:43,900 --> 00:39:47,250
he took a lazy shot.
The guy sprawled and sprawled right into

965
00:39:47,260 --> 00:39:48,850
guard.
Went right to a leg lock.

966
00:39:48,851 --> 00:39:51,760
The fight was over in.
Those blocks are ridiculous,

967
00:39:51,761 --> 00:39:53,230
dude.
His legs are ridiculous.

968
00:39:53,231 --> 00:39:58,231
His legs are ridiculous.
That was watching him move around and I 

969
00:39:58,231 --> 00:40:01,011
was like,
this dude has like grapefruit stuffed 

970
00:40:01,011 --> 00:40:01,011
into his cafs.

971
00:40:01,011 --> 00:40:02,480
Cafs really looked like that.
Nobody's built like Paul.

972
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:07,800
People should watch that fight.
Pahara his last fight and look at that 

973
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:11,290
as a serious way out of a fight that 
you're having trouble and if you're in a

974
00:40:11,291 --> 00:40:13,870
fight and you're beating them standing,
fuck it.

975
00:40:13,871 --> 00:40:15,830
Stay standing.
You've got this motherfucker.

976
00:40:15,850 --> 00:40:18,790
Don't take them down.
If you can take them down.

977
00:40:18,940 --> 00:40:21,670
If it's pretty easy to take him down,
take him down,

978
00:40:21,671 --> 00:40:26,671
get on top,
but if you can't strike with them and 

979
00:40:26,671 --> 00:40:27,250
you can't take them down,
which comes up and so many fights,

980
00:40:27,251 --> 00:40:32,251
it's so common.
You got to have your guard dangerous 

981
00:40:32,251 --> 00:40:34,370
enough so that you can pull guard either
with leg locks.

982
00:40:35,060 --> 00:40:40,060
You know,
whatever liquid Baha'is look at early 

983
00:40:40,060 --> 00:40:40,060
Maya.
Yeah,

984
00:40:40,060 --> 00:40:40,390
he's got to figure it out,
but too bad.

985
00:40:40,420 --> 00:40:42,490
His Jujitsu is awesome.
It's awesome.

986
00:40:42,600 --> 00:40:44,050
The old days watched him is awesome.

987
00:40:44,110 --> 00:40:45,370
He's definitely got to figure it out 
though.

988
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:46,780
It's fucking crazy.
Game,

989
00:40:46,781 --> 00:40:47,690
man.
The fight game.

990
00:40:48,290 --> 00:40:52,060
It's a ridiculous game.
Ridiculous way to make a living,

991
00:40:52,061 --> 00:40:54,820
man.
We want to talk about the craziest,

992
00:40:54,821 --> 00:40:57,130
most dangerous way outside of war to 
make a living.

993
00:40:57,670 --> 00:40:58,360
That's it,
right?

994
00:40:58,470 --> 00:41:00,750
Imagine getting pushed into face 
everyday training.

995
00:41:01,180 --> 00:41:04,510
Yeah.
I can't fucking shit again for sure.

996
00:41:05,170 --> 00:41:07,810
Every fucking day,
10 fucking years.

997
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:08,840
I remember when I first,
uh,

998
00:41:08,870 --> 00:41:13,870
the thing that really got me thinking 
about what kind of damage a striking 

999
00:41:13,870 --> 00:41:18,421
does to your head was when I started 
transitioning from taekwondo to 

1000
00:41:18,421 --> 00:41:19,990
kickboxing man because I was a novice.
My striking was not very good.

1001
00:41:19,991 --> 00:41:21,460
My hands were not good.
I could punch hard,

1002
00:41:21,461 --> 00:41:26,461
but I didn't really know how to box yet.
And I would go in there with guys who 

1003
00:41:26,461 --> 00:41:26,740
didn't know how to box and even if they 
weren't punching you hard,

1004
00:41:26,741 --> 00:41:31,741
they were hitting you a lot and you just
go home and you're fucking what would 

1005
00:41:31,741 --> 00:41:31,741
lie in bed.

1006
00:41:31,741 --> 00:41:33,590
And my head would throb foam,
foam,

1007
00:41:33,740 --> 00:41:36,020
foam,
foam is that terrible female.

1008
00:41:36,021 --> 00:41:38,580
Like what am I doing in my brain?
No,

1009
00:41:38,600 --> 00:41:43,600
this can't be good.
Lying in bed with headaches after a 

1010
00:41:43,600 --> 00:41:43,820
sparring session.
That shit can't be good.

1011
00:41:44,090 --> 00:41:45,000
And he'd go everywhere.
The,

1012
00:41:45,010 --> 00:41:48,140
the light would hurt.
Like I wear sunglasses because he was.

1013
00:41:48,200 --> 00:41:53,200
The light would like hurt when your head
is pounding from getting punched in the 

1014
00:41:53,200 --> 00:41:53,540
head.
Shit is so bad for you.

1015
00:41:53,570 --> 00:41:55,400
That's why Jujitsu so beautiful.
You get the,

1016
00:41:55,490 --> 00:42:00,490
you get the thrill of the kill,
yet there's no brain damage it except 

1017
00:42:00,490 --> 00:42:00,710
you know the guy who scares everybody 
the most.

1018
00:42:00,711 --> 00:42:03,470
It's Paul Harris because everybody else 
just kind of taps you out.

1019
00:42:03,650 --> 00:42:07,100
Paul Harvey's rips your legs apart.
He rips through his legs apart.

1020
00:42:07,430 --> 00:42:09,640
I mean he just gets a hold of your leg 
and like,

1021
00:42:09,710 --> 00:42:12,290
sorry ain't walking right anymore.
That's it.

1022
00:42:12,290 --> 00:42:13,970
You be legs.
Fuck for like a year.

1023
00:42:14,060 --> 00:42:19,060
Good luck.
He might be the first guy to leg lock 

1024
00:42:19,060 --> 00:42:20,210
his way to the top because if he just 
keeps doing what he's doing,

1025
00:42:20,570 --> 00:42:23,180
what is he doing?
He's not really striking too much with a

1026
00:42:23,181 --> 00:42:25,990
little bit.
He's just going to shoe and you're gonna

1027
00:42:26,010 --> 00:42:27,950
sprawl because the shot wasn't that 
good.

1028
00:42:27,951 --> 00:42:32,951
He's not a wrestler.
And then he's going to pull guard right 

1029
00:42:32,951 --> 00:42:35,051
into your legs.
So what are you going to do against 

1030
00:42:35,051 --> 00:42:38,951
that?
You can work on your takedown defense 

1031
00:42:38,951 --> 00:42:39,800
all fucking day to your head explodes.
He's going to pull guard on you.

1032
00:42:39,830 --> 00:42:44,830
He's taken all your wrestling and just 
throwing it out and fucking garbage all 

1033
00:42:44,830 --> 00:42:46,820
you're striking.
You're wasting your motherfucking time.

1034
00:42:47,360 --> 00:42:49,130
He's just going to take a shot and pull 
guard.

1035
00:42:49,160 --> 00:42:53,720
He's a beast.
It's an amazing talent and skill to work

1036
00:42:53,721 --> 00:42:54,260
on and not.

1037
00:42:54,290 --> 00:42:57,090
I don't think that many fighters.
Um,

1038
00:42:57,440 --> 00:43:02,440
well,
I know not that many fighters are 

1039
00:43:02,440 --> 00:43:02,440
working on it and Marsha,
they should go explore what's.

1040
00:43:02,440 --> 00:43:02,850
So how much did you love Chicago?
Sweet.

1041
00:43:03,060 --> 00:43:06,060
Do you have a great fucking time but 
still fucking spending.

1042
00:43:06,320 --> 00:43:07,250
Goddamn,
we had fun,

1043
00:43:07,251 --> 00:43:08,690
right?
The fucking stage,

1044
00:43:08,691 --> 00:43:09,640
man.
It was overwhelming.

1045
00:43:10,490 --> 00:43:11,990
That was one of the best shows we've 
ever done,

1046
00:43:11,991 --> 00:43:14,510
I think is the best show we ever did.
When I walked on stage.

1047
00:43:14,570 --> 00:43:19,570
I had a study for step for a second,
like the weed and the fucking stage hit 

1048
00:43:19,570 --> 00:43:21,860
me all at one shot.
I couldn't digest my brain.

1049
00:43:22,240 --> 00:43:24,770
It was like I had a concussion for the 
first three minutes.

1050
00:43:25,070 --> 00:43:30,070
It was very surreal.
And then once I got my time and go and 

1051
00:43:30,070 --> 00:43:31,520
it was all over,
but it was very surreal at first I could

1052
00:43:31,521 --> 00:43:36,521
absorb it.
I'm used to doing the feeder with a 

1053
00:43:36,521 --> 00:43:38,111
bottom of the top,
not a bottom or top of the other top on 

1054
00:43:38,111 --> 00:43:39,320
top of that.
Another top on top of that filled to the

1055
00:43:39,321 --> 00:43:42,260
brim of the people fucking yelling.
They know who the fuck you are.

1056
00:43:42,850 --> 00:43:43,760
The energy level.

1057
00:43:44,460 --> 00:43:47,070
Esther's parents.
Just everything about the show is nuts.

1058
00:43:47,080 --> 00:43:49,970
The line after we heard little esther's 
parents wouldn't let her,

1059
00:43:50,030 --> 00:43:53,090
didn't want her to take her to the UFC 
or didn't want to take her.

1060
00:43:53,120 --> 00:43:58,120
They just didn't want to drive.
She lives about 40 minutes outside of 

1061
00:43:58,120 --> 00:44:01,300
where the UFC.
They didn't want to drive and go to the 

1062
00:44:01,300 --> 00:44:01,740
traffic and the traffic was nuts.
Yeah,

1063
00:44:01,870 --> 00:44:02,900
they were Nice,
nice people.

1064
00:44:03,350 --> 00:44:08,350
Nice to us.
I don't know what they did to her to 

1065
00:44:08,350 --> 00:44:10,151
make her a little less gray.
Lebeaux drive with Damien fucking great 

1066
00:44:10,151 --> 00:44:10,470
guy.
Dan Dan is awesome.

1067
00:44:10,940 --> 00:44:12,080
She was um,
she,

1068
00:44:12,110 --> 00:44:15,800
she fucking killed dude killed and she 
went on after Joey.

1069
00:44:16,430 --> 00:44:20,060
Joey lit the place on fire and then 
little lester goes up and I mean,

1070
00:44:20,061 --> 00:44:24,350
she had a fucking killer set dude.
She's got some great jokes.

1071
00:44:24,740 --> 00:44:25,360
She's,
I,

1072
00:44:25,361 --> 00:44:30,361
I really.
I'm going to send this to her parents 

1073
00:44:30,361 --> 00:44:30,361
and I'm not bullshitting.
I go.

1074
00:44:30,361 --> 00:44:32,010
She's way funnier than I was at her age.
She's way better than

1075
00:44:32,010 --> 00:44:33,000
I was at her age.
She's,

1076
00:44:33,120 --> 00:44:35,250
she's going to be a killer man.
You know,

1077
00:44:35,280 --> 00:44:36,150
she's right now.
What is she?

1078
00:44:36,151 --> 00:44:37,760
Twenty three or something like that?
Hold the sheet.

1079
00:44:37,860 --> 00:44:38,690
Yeah,
23,

1080
00:44:38,780 --> 00:44:41,880
23.
I was blown away.

1081
00:44:41,881 --> 00:44:44,520
The night was great.
The fans are great.

1082
00:44:44,521 --> 00:44:48,060
The people I talked to was great,
but my night was made with little,

1083
00:44:48,800 --> 00:44:53,800
uh,
parents where they don't have parents 

1084
00:44:53,800 --> 00:44:53,800
come on.
Great.

1085
00:44:53,800 --> 00:44:54,150
Is that for your parents to come see you
in the theater?

1086
00:44:54,160 --> 00:44:56,340
They know.
Not just your parents.

1087
00:44:56,341 --> 00:45:01,341
See you.
Anybody could see you when you were on 

1088
00:45:01,341 --> 00:45:01,980
hbo and you got your hour.
I'm talking about the night that it hits

1089
00:45:01,981 --> 00:45:03,630
you.
It hits their parents.

1090
00:45:03,631 --> 00:45:05,610
Finally,
what their daughter was really doing.

1091
00:45:05,900 --> 00:45:06,980
You know,
you come home as a kid,

1092
00:45:06,990 --> 00:45:07,470
you're like,
Dad,

1093
00:45:07,471 --> 00:45:09,450
I want to fucking jump off planes.
What?

1094
00:45:09,570 --> 00:45:11,250
You're going to come work in the factory
with me.

1095
00:45:11,490 --> 00:45:12,210
That's it.
What?

1096
00:45:12,211 --> 00:45:14,490
Nobody in his family ever jumped on the 
fucking planes.

1097
00:45:14,580 --> 00:45:16,200
Fuck you.
You're going to die.

1098
00:45:16,320 --> 00:45:18,360
And for two years,
that's all you get is torture.

1099
00:45:18,510 --> 00:45:21,990
And then finally something you know and 
every family has,

1100
00:45:21,991 --> 00:45:23,250
I'm not going to come see you.
You know,

1101
00:45:23,251 --> 00:45:24,690
your father is not going to come see 
you.

1102
00:45:24,810 --> 00:45:28,110
He doesn't approve of you boxing and all
of a sudden one night you followed us.

1103
00:45:28,111 --> 00:45:32,370
Come and you know what?
She just wasn't with Jenny on a bunch of

1104
00:45:32,371 --> 00:45:35,010
girls.
She was with killers.

1105
00:45:35,370 --> 00:45:39,030
She was with Marines from the comedy 
store bootcamp training.

1106
00:45:39,330 --> 00:45:42,420
They went to Canada Pendleton.
I followed Paul Moody.

1107
00:45:42,600 --> 00:45:45,630
She was dead.
So I seen her growth right there.

1108
00:45:45,631 --> 00:45:47,850
When she got off stage,
her little face.

1109
00:45:47,851 --> 00:45:49,250
I had tears in my eyes.
Doug.

1110
00:45:49,251 --> 00:45:54,251
I was,
I was so excited for her because you 

1111
00:45:54,251 --> 00:45:54,251
can't describe that,
uh,

1112
00:45:54,251 --> 00:45:54,251
parents with that pro.

1113
00:45:54,251 --> 00:45:55,220
Yeah,
she was a,

1114
00:45:55,470 --> 00:45:57,090
it was incredible.
It's the best show.

1115
00:45:57,300 --> 00:45:58,950
It was the best show we ever did for 
sure.

1116
00:45:59,160 --> 00:46:02,570
The biggest show we ever did to now I've
never sold out that many people.

1117
00:46:02,660 --> 00:46:04,590
We sold out that whole place.
It was like 3,300

1118
00:46:04,591 --> 00:46:06,720
seats or something.
It was nuts.

1119
00:46:06,721 --> 00:46:09,170
That's nice man.
300 is giant.

1120
00:46:09,500 --> 00:46:13,440
Giant records of it.
I've got videos of record,

1121
00:46:13,441 --> 00:46:18,441
right?
You saw another guy that had a desk 

1122
00:46:18,441 --> 00:46:18,441
squad tattoo.
Yeah.

1123
00:46:18,441 --> 00:46:21,090
Another guy on a desk.
Squad Tattoo Joey Diaz shirts.

1124
00:46:21,570 --> 00:46:24,540
I was just fucking overwhelming.
I'm going to email you this.

1125
00:46:24,541 --> 00:46:26,880
You could put this on the thing.
It was very.

1126
00:46:26,881 --> 00:46:28,960
It was very just,
it's just to fucking.

1127
00:46:29,370 --> 00:46:34,370
I had a hot beef and Italian sausage 
Combo Sandwich that I almost stayed 

1128
00:46:34,370 --> 00:46:35,940
there.
Almost fucking moved their red band with

1129
00:46:35,941 --> 00:46:38,670
hot and sour peppers and sweet peppers 
is the beef.

1130
00:46:39,210 --> 00:46:40,800
I mean this shit was fucking delicious.

1131
00:46:41,070 --> 00:46:43,230
The restaurant went to the first night 
was delicious.

1132
00:46:43,560 --> 00:46:48,560
The fucking Fogo.
The second night when went to that 

1133
00:46:48,560 --> 00:46:48,560
state,
it was just fucking done.

1134
00:46:48,600 --> 00:46:51,930
My asshole life Sunday smelled like I 
had firecrackers and they're like,

1135
00:46:51,931 --> 00:46:55,040
I have gunpowder in.
My Shit was heavy duty meat.

1136
00:46:55,320 --> 00:46:57,750
They put heavy duty gunpowder in the 
meat and Chicago.

1137
00:46:57,751 --> 00:47:02,060
That cattle is the real fucking deal.
They got Deca in it because my asshole,

1138
00:47:02,100 --> 00:47:04,140
I had a light candles and the fucking 
hotel.

1139
00:47:04,141 --> 00:47:05,230
It was hard.
I walked,

1140
00:47:05,240 --> 00:47:06,580
you know,
Joey and I were uh,

1141
00:47:06,630 --> 00:47:09,750
we were staying in a corner of the hotel
and so we had our own.

1142
00:47:09,810 --> 00:47:14,810
We had a door that would go into this 
area and then he had a door and I had a 

1143
00:47:14,810 --> 00:47:15,590
door,
so we had like two doors.

1144
00:47:15,610 --> 00:47:20,610
It was like our door that to get into 
our little area and then we each had 

1145
00:47:20,610 --> 00:47:22,440
individual door.
I would open up my door in Chicago,

1146
00:47:22,441 --> 00:47:24,360
by the way is fucking 30 degrees 
outside.

1147
00:47:24,570 --> 00:47:29,570
He's got his windows open and you hear 
the wind whistling in like a haunted 

1148
00:47:29,570 --> 00:47:29,570
house.

1149
00:47:32,520 --> 00:47:34,300
I would open up the door and literally 
say,

1150
00:47:34,330 --> 00:47:36,040
it wouldn't sound like,
you know,

1151
00:47:36,110 --> 00:47:38,310
like there was a hurricane going on in 
the next week.

1152
00:47:38,330 --> 00:47:39,730
You know,
was still sweating at night.

1153
00:47:40,930 --> 00:47:45,930
You got to go to a doctor,
so I was still sweating to listen to 

1154
00:47:45,930 --> 00:47:49,500
dog.
I walked into the doctor's office 

1155
00:47:49,500 --> 00:47:49,560
yesterday for my preop.
I walked in there a quarter to nine.

1156
00:47:49,570 --> 00:47:51,700
I hadn't smoked reefer,
didn't smoke reefer.

1157
00:47:51,710 --> 00:47:53,350
The night before I had 10 hours of 
sleep,

1158
00:47:53,620 --> 00:47:58,620
drink water.
I was relaxing on my blood pressure was 

1159
00:47:58,620 --> 00:47:59,450
at a 45 in the morning.
One 85 over 100.

1160
00:47:59,940 --> 00:48:01,690
No,
that's horrible.

1161
00:48:01,840 --> 00:48:05,140
That's fucking murder.
Then after they took the blood out,

1162
00:48:05,530 --> 00:48:09,490
it went down to like 1:40
over 90 and that's okay,

1163
00:48:09,491 --> 00:48:11,530
but it's still not acceptable.
You know what I'm saying?

1164
00:48:11,950 --> 00:48:15,010
My engine runs hot all the time.
I take the medication,

1165
00:48:15,011 --> 00:48:15,760
I take the.
Well,

1166
00:48:15,761 --> 00:48:18,030
you lost a Shitload of weight at one 
point in time.

1167
00:48:18,080 --> 00:48:19,780
Don't matter.
How much did you put back on?

1168
00:48:20,470 --> 00:48:21,400
That's it.
That's it.

1169
00:48:21,470 --> 00:48:24,220
I'm 95.
I was shocked yesterday.

1170
00:48:24,820 --> 00:48:28,240
I was even shocked yesterday,
but some of the weight I put back,

1171
00:48:28,241 --> 00:48:29,220
I lifted.
I fucked.

1172
00:48:29,520 --> 00:48:34,520
Some of my legs are strong again.
I mean I'm trying to fucking really do 

1173
00:48:34,520 --> 00:48:34,600
this.
I wouldn't want to get in shape.

1174
00:48:35,360 --> 00:48:37,000
You can be an in shape.
Fat Dude.

1175
00:48:37,330 --> 00:48:40,180
You know what I'm saying?
Like it can't be opened your titties and

1176
00:48:40,181 --> 00:48:40,810
shit like that.

1177
00:48:43,180 --> 00:48:47,170
I really fucking try at this.
You know what I'm saying?

1178
00:48:47,171 --> 00:48:48,820
I take my pills,
I drink a lot of water,

1179
00:48:54,350 --> 00:48:55,920
but if I'm eat,
if I'm in Chicago,

1180
00:48:55,940 --> 00:49:00,940
Joe Rogan,
you're not going to go to weight 

1181
00:49:00,940 --> 00:49:03,260
watchers to suck my fucking salad.
We always eat salad,

1182
00:49:07,271 --> 00:49:12,271
mixed Greens for breakfast.
I eat fucking oatmeal.

1183
00:49:13,010 --> 00:49:15,320
I'm real careful about.
Not eating too much,

1184
00:49:15,920 --> 00:49:20,920
but we had like two hours,
two hours because my blood pressure a 

1185
00:49:30,261 --> 00:49:35,261
little bit better shape.
I got to figure something out for blood 

1186
00:49:35,261 --> 00:49:37,060
pressure.
Straight vegetable diet.

1187
00:49:39,050 --> 00:49:42,860
That's the best way to trim your body 
down.

1188
00:49:47,260 --> 00:49:52,260
Fifteen hundred pounds.
Plus I probably gained 20 pounds.

1189
00:49:58,010 --> 00:50:00,810
When you're that big,
how do you know?

1190
00:50:00,820 --> 00:50:05,820
Because you go to a regular scale.
I always kept thinking.

1191
00:50:26,950 --> 00:50:31,950
Got The fucking meat scale.
They got to where they give you the 

1192
00:50:31,950 --> 00:50:34,430
Jihad attack where they shoot the speed 
and you get on the fucking bicycle and 

1193
00:50:34,430 --> 00:50:37,370
start running the ship.
And that day was for fucking 15.

1194
00:50:37,520 --> 00:50:38,960
Oh my God.
So that's the biggest he ever.

1195
00:50:39,020 --> 00:50:43,450
That was November of 2009 or something.
And I said,

1196
00:50:43,470 --> 00:50:43,940
no.
He goes,

1197
00:50:44,180 --> 00:50:47,300
come back in January and we will put you
on a,

1198
00:50:47,301 --> 00:50:48,850
on a diet that fucking,
you know,

1199
00:50:48,870 --> 00:50:50,060
the lap band,
whatever.

1200
00:50:50,600 --> 00:50:51,280
Oh.
And I was,

1201
00:50:51,290 --> 00:50:52,370
you know,
I'm scared of needles.

1202
00:50:52,371 --> 00:50:54,200
That's a couple of times you got to go 
see that motherfucker.

1203
00:50:54,230 --> 00:50:59,230
Not just a scared and Nino thing when 
people break those things many times is 

1204
00:50:59,230 --> 00:50:59,230
Ralph.
He had that operation.

1205
00:50:59,230 --> 00:50:59,680
Ralph.
He had the other.

1206
00:50:59,720 --> 00:51:00,690
Yeah,
the other one.

1207
00:51:00,691 --> 00:51:02,930
The bypass.
He broke it though,

1208
00:51:02,931 --> 00:51:04,360
right?
He busted the needle.

1209
00:51:04,370 --> 00:51:05,520
Snap the fuck.
Well,

1210
00:51:05,550 --> 00:51:10,550
he made us.
He made them a smaller stomach and then 

1211
00:51:10,550 --> 00:51:13,750
he broke through it somehow or another.
Some overstuffed themselves.

1212
00:51:13,751 --> 00:51:15,950
I don't know.
Why didn't you have him on your podcast?

1213
00:51:16,320 --> 00:51:20,090
He was talking about how he almost died.
He was very good man.

1214
00:51:20,300 --> 00:51:21,110
Yeah.
What did he say?

1215
00:51:21,410 --> 00:51:24,010
It was just one of those fucking things.
He was light.

1216
00:51:24,020 --> 00:51:26,610
He was burnt down.
Do you look at a guy like Dan?

1217
00:51:26,710 --> 00:51:28,670
As long as this bitches alive.
Catcher,

1218
00:51:28,880 --> 00:51:30,730
canary bird,
pull mine.

1219
00:51:31,520 --> 00:51:32,240
You know what,
man?

1220
00:51:32,241 --> 00:51:34,130
I know how hard it was for him to 
travel.

1221
00:51:34,131 --> 00:51:39,131
I know what it was like to get on a 
plane when you're 415 pounds and the 

1222
00:51:39,131 --> 00:51:39,760
seatbelt don't even fit in fucking 
firstclass.

1223
00:51:39,800 --> 00:51:41,630
Okay.
I know what it's like.

1224
00:51:41,870 --> 00:51:43,760
How to walk out,
how your joints hurt.

1225
00:51:43,761 --> 00:51:46,010
That's why I love these personal 
trainers that you know.

1226
00:51:46,020 --> 00:51:47,870
I,
I go to north Hollywood parking lot guy,

1227
00:51:47,871 --> 00:51:50,480
400 pounds walking around the park.
It's not going to work.

1228
00:51:50,481 --> 00:51:55,481
My friend,
it's going to last three weeks is a tap 

1229
00:51:55,481 --> 00:51:55,481
out.
The joint pain is unbearable.

1230
00:51:55,481 --> 00:51:57,950
Put them in a fucking pool and make them
eat vegetables and shit like that.

1231
00:51:57,951 --> 00:52:00,080
You know,
and I know what it's like to sleep.

1232
00:52:00,110 --> 00:52:01,910
What it is a joint pain.
That's the real issue.

1233
00:52:02,130 --> 00:52:04,010
It's amazing.
It's amazing.

1234
00:52:04,220 --> 00:52:09,220
And every time you fucking fly,
your ankles swell up and he's flying to 

1235
00:52:09,220 --> 00:52:13,031
eight times a fucking week.
You know Ralph constantly on the road 

1236
00:52:13,031 --> 00:52:13,700
every week.
He's on the road already.

1237
00:52:13,850 --> 00:52:15,470
How bad is it?
He's on the road already.

1238
00:52:15,471 --> 00:52:20,090
So he's in Tempe for superbowl weekend.
Eight fucking shows the whole fucking.

1239
00:52:20,091 --> 00:52:20,930
So he stopped.

1240
00:52:21,020 --> 00:52:23,270
He stopped smoking weed.
He stopped smoking weed.

1241
00:52:23,300 --> 00:52:24,920
Is he eating it?
Nothing.

1242
00:52:24,980 --> 00:52:25,420
No.
Wait.

1243
00:52:25,440 --> 00:52:26,780
You can't do nothing.
Oh,

1244
00:52:27,080 --> 00:52:28,880
that's so sad.
Why did he stop?

1245
00:52:28,940 --> 00:52:33,940
Because because of what?
He had blood clots in his lung or 

1246
00:52:33,940 --> 00:52:34,500
something like that.
How would we.

1247
00:52:34,510 --> 00:52:39,510
The hurt that it affected his lungs.
We did all the smoking it to smoking it 

1248
00:52:39,510 --> 00:52:41,870
in the fucking flying and the fucking,
you know,

1249
00:52:41,871 --> 00:52:44,720
not breathing and it adds up after the 
whole thing.

1250
00:52:44,721 --> 00:52:47,060
He would make all that traveling fun,
you know,

1251
00:52:47,061 --> 00:52:49,230
they do.
They do all these tests on marijuana and

1252
00:52:49,231 --> 00:52:50,870
they do tests on the guy like Eddie 
Bravo,

1253
00:52:51,200 --> 00:52:55,700
who's a normal weight yourself.
When you add 400 pounds,

1254
00:52:55,701 --> 00:53:00,701
it's got to do something to your fucking
lungs when your lungs are this big and 

1255
00:53:00,701 --> 00:53:01,010
you're trying to.
What's going on Brian?

1256
00:53:01,220 --> 00:53:02,720
Oh,
that's what's going on.

1257
00:53:04,240 --> 00:53:07,640
Fucking essentially found treasure 
affects you at every level.

1258
00:53:07,640 --> 00:53:12,640
Man.
The reef is just something that they 

1259
00:53:12,640 --> 00:53:12,800
told him to stop smoking as a 
precautionary measure,

1260
00:53:13,280 --> 00:53:17,030
but I think the smoking anything is 
probably not so fucking good.

1261
00:53:17,090 --> 00:53:17,850
Nobody,
you know,

1262
00:53:18,050 --> 00:53:19,640
there's no evidence that it causes 
cancer.

1263
00:53:19,641 --> 00:53:24,641
It's very different from tobacco smoke.
We have smoke all putting in the same 

1264
00:53:24,641 --> 00:53:24,641
category,
but it's not.

1265
00:53:24,641 --> 00:53:26,130
It's not.
But there's other options.

1266
00:53:26,131 --> 00:53:29,400
It's got to do something to you that 
I've been smoking for 30 years.

1267
00:53:29,401 --> 00:53:31,570
I've coughed.
I've split fucking colors.

1268
00:53:31,880 --> 00:53:33,400
Fucking smurfs.
The whole thing.

1269
00:53:33,720 --> 00:53:35,440
Something's gotta be going on with your 
life.

1270
00:53:35,730 --> 00:53:37,050
You know,
these people sit there so well.

1271
00:53:37,051 --> 00:53:38,700
Harvard did the research and that's 
great.

1272
00:53:38,850 --> 00:53:42,630
It's got to do something to you.
So you got nothing is fucking free,

1273
00:53:42,810 --> 00:53:45,180
you got to pay somewhere along the 
fucking line.

1274
00:53:45,360 --> 00:53:47,430
So knock it the fuck off.
Reading high time.

1275
00:53:47,431 --> 00:53:49,890
Some scientists would a be with sandals 
on.

1276
00:53:49,890 --> 00:53:52,980
I don't give a fuck.
I'm telling you that somewhere along the

1277
00:53:52,981 --> 00:53:57,981
line smoker,
for 30 years I've been smoking weed for 

1278
00:53:57,981 --> 00:53:58,020
fucking dirty is.
And I'll tell you what,

1279
00:53:58,021 --> 00:53:59,590
I know for a fact.
I got that seat.

1280
00:53:59,610 --> 00:54:02,400
The whole PD.
I know for a fact that OCD,

1281
00:54:02,430 --> 00:54:07,430
no POCD pocd shit with your lungs when 
you hear the little bells and whistles 

1282
00:54:07,430 --> 00:54:12,111
and your lungs.
So you know when you right now you're 

1283
00:54:12,111 --> 00:54:16,780
ever going to be breathing on the have 
you ever still below me breathing on the

1284
00:54:18,721 --> 00:54:20,610
microphone.
You're fucking stupid.

1285
00:54:20,880 --> 00:54:23,130
You ever do a thing on the microphone?
You go join me here.

1286
00:54:23,131 --> 00:54:24,900
You're breathing.
You hear you breathing.

1287
00:54:25,110 --> 00:54:27,660
Do you hear any breathing?
That cop did something.

1288
00:54:28,020 --> 00:54:30,120
So what I usually do is look at the fuck
up.

1289
00:54:30,150 --> 00:54:34,660
Don't look at that look acronym.
What?

1290
00:54:35,330 --> 00:54:36,930
Remember,
I used to take the steroids that used to

1291
00:54:36,931 --> 00:54:41,931
breathe in and it gives you a fucking 
know that the one doctor said as my 

1292
00:54:43,340 --> 00:54:43,740
asthma.

1293
00:54:43,760 --> 00:54:48,760
Yeah,
so what I used to do is whenever I hear 

1294
00:54:48,760 --> 00:54:48,760
the bells and whistles,
you just go run around three labs.

1295
00:54:48,760 --> 00:54:50,910
Both claims are that really have been 
doing that for years.

1296
00:54:50,911 --> 00:54:55,911
Whenever I hear a bell and whistle that 
museum walking enough cock suck and get 

1297
00:54:55,911 --> 00:54:59,061
on the blow the whistle.
Did you get that thing that Brian's got 

1298
00:54:59,061 --> 00:54:59,790
you.
That's great.

1299
00:54:59,791 --> 00:55:01,410
That's great and shit,
but you just got to get out and walk.

1300
00:55:01,411 --> 00:55:03,010
Forget computers.
Right?

1301
00:55:03,100 --> 00:55:08,100
But the beautiful thing about that,
it tells you what you're telling 

1302
00:55:08,100 --> 00:55:09,030
yourself.
It tells you how much you're doing

1303
00:55:09,190 --> 00:55:12,820
and if you think you need it and you're.
You don't have any money,

1304
00:55:12,821 --> 00:55:14,620
just write on a piece of paper.
You're lazy.

1305
00:55:14,621 --> 00:55:16,920
Fucking put in your pocket.
And that's what I've realized that,

1306
00:55:16,921 --> 00:55:18,790
that,
that what I do,

1307
00:55:19,250 --> 00:55:20,410
look at it and I'm like,
Oh shit,

1308
00:55:20,411 --> 00:55:21,760
I'm lazy.
I know this already.

1309
00:55:21,761 --> 00:55:24,220
I could.
I could have saved myself $100.

1310
00:55:24,420 --> 00:55:27,100
And so you're not.
You're not changing your habits.

1311
00:55:27,120 --> 00:55:31,360
And I can see myself trying to beat my 
score before I can kind of see that,

1312
00:55:31,361 --> 00:55:36,361
but unfortunately I just had this 
lifestyle that I'm so fucking busy that 

1313
00:55:36,361 --> 00:55:40,410
the only way that I can change that,
it's just to make sure I work out every 

1314
00:55:40,410 --> 00:55:41,230
day where this is more like for people 
that I guess,

1315
00:55:41,270 --> 00:55:42,940
uh,
like have time,

1316
00:55:42,970 --> 00:55:47,970
more time to try to jog more is totally 
doing a totally different approach to 

1317
00:55:48,251 --> 00:55:53,251
what we're doing.
Brian is working out solely so that he 

1318
00:55:53,251 --> 00:55:53,251
can get more pussy.

1319
00:55:53,251 --> 00:55:54,590
That's fine.
That's his issue.

1320
00:55:54,950 --> 00:55:57,400
That's why 60 percent of people take 
fucking steroids.

1321
00:55:57,460 --> 00:55:58,780
Had an athletic.
I'm telling you,

1322
00:55:58,781 --> 00:56:00,640
you go to a bar,
there's 18 guys looking around.

1323
00:56:00,850 --> 00:56:02,560
You think they'd gone from Ms Dot 
Olympia and you're like,

1324
00:56:02,561 --> 00:56:05,170
where do you live in Glendale?
So what's all these weights for?

1325
00:56:05,171 --> 00:56:06,160
For what?
To Do,

1326
00:56:06,161 --> 00:56:08,440
what?
To be a bartender for like a buck,

1327
00:56:08,441 --> 00:56:10,750
a local club.
Not to pick up pussy.

1328
00:56:11,290 --> 00:56:13,180
That's a lot to steroids.
Not really.

1329
00:56:13,181 --> 00:56:18,181
No.
You just looked like a fucking tree 

1330
00:56:18,181 --> 00:56:18,181
trunk,
but you don't do steroids.

1331
00:56:18,181 --> 00:56:18,440
Okay.
You like the barbarian brothers?

1332
00:56:18,700 --> 00:56:20,650
Eight 36 seconds for the last three 
years.

1333
00:56:20,651 --> 00:56:23,420
Every fucking day.
Well,

1334
00:56:23,440 --> 00:56:26,020
Brian is just doing it to keep up.
It's got a freak on the line.

1335
00:56:26,060 --> 00:56:31,060
That's what he's gonna do I need a 
couple more people don't get fucking 

1336
00:56:31,060 --> 00:56:31,480
serious until they got shredded until 
they get rushed to the hospital.

1337
00:56:31,720 --> 00:56:35,980
This obesity epidemic in this country 
isn't til you get rushed to the hospital

1338
00:56:35,981 --> 00:56:38,740
with two coming out of your ass and 
you'll be at the gym doing jumping jacks

1339
00:56:38,741 --> 00:56:40,900
borough or you're gonna fucking die.
When did it,

1340
00:56:41,200 --> 00:56:43,810
when did it affect you?
When did you really start thinking,

1341
00:56:43,840 --> 00:56:48,460
I've got to do something when my fucking
spine was hurting,

1342
00:56:48,461 --> 00:56:50,150
when I do blow,
blow,

1343
00:56:50,290 --> 00:56:52,540
blow back of my neck was fucking gone.

1344
00:56:55,260 --> 00:57:00,260
When I would do blow,
when I would have to wear underwear to 

1345
00:57:00,260 --> 00:57:01,390
go to the gym because I was pissed my 
pants because I couldn't catch my breath

1346
00:57:01,420 --> 00:57:06,420
when I was throwing punches with Jesus 
Christ when I fucking realized it and I 

1347
00:57:06,691 --> 00:57:11,691
knew that I wasn't going to get the 
operation that wasn't not gonna fucking 

1348
00:57:11,691 --> 00:57:12,520
work at all.
So I knew that I had just eat right.

1349
00:57:12,710 --> 00:57:14,770
And you just can't deal with the idea,
but it will.

1350
00:57:14,771 --> 00:57:17,390
You were also talking about it like it 
was like a weak thing to do.

1351
00:57:17,980 --> 00:57:20,740
Working out the I should know.
Yeah.

1352
00:57:21,520 --> 00:57:23,590
People think in this country.
Everything Bro.

1353
00:57:23,591 --> 00:57:26,860
Look at that fucking kids we've got now 
a kid has a fucking bad day.

1354
00:57:26,861 --> 00:57:29,290
They put them on a fucking pill and then
when they get older,

1355
00:57:29,300 --> 00:57:31,510
the computer crashes.
Now I got to put them in London.

1356
00:57:31,511 --> 00:57:32,590
They have a nervous breakdown.

1357
00:57:32,710 --> 00:57:34,480
You're going a little league and fucking
Sherman Oaks.

1358
00:57:34,660 --> 00:57:36,520
You know you can't yell at the kids to 
Stryker.

1359
00:57:36,521 --> 00:57:39,250
You suck or swing.
These kids are fucking pimp.

1360
00:57:39,251 --> 00:57:41,260
But that's why half of them on fucking 
pills guy.

1361
00:57:41,470 --> 00:57:46,470
So what you're trying to tell me is I 
can go to burger king every night and 

1362
00:57:46,470 --> 00:57:47,860
he'd like a fat slob.
I'm 35 and call Mr.

1363
00:57:47,950 --> 00:57:52,950
Lap band and get my shit together.
And that's what you're telling this 

1364
00:57:52,950 --> 00:57:56,041
country.
So half of these motherfuckers gone for 

1365
00:57:56,041 --> 00:57:56,041
the right thing.
You got to,

1366
00:57:56,041 --> 00:57:57,990
when you're 400 pounds,
you're not sick.

1367
00:57:58,120 --> 00:58:00,310
It's your character.
Something's not right.

1368
00:58:00,700 --> 00:58:05,700
Something's not right.
So if you get up and walk to the corner 

1369
00:58:05,700 --> 00:58:05,740
every fucking day,
eventually going to get bored walking to

1370
00:58:05,741 --> 00:58:07,180
the corner.
So you're gonna walk another corner,

1371
00:58:07,480 --> 00:58:09,100
then you're going to walk another 
quarter national.

1372
00:58:09,140 --> 00:58:14,140
Don't even walk to the YMC like I did 
and you got to get on the bicycle for 

1373
00:58:14,140 --> 00:58:14,880
five minutes and there's 10 minutes and 
it all helps out.

1374
00:58:15,070 --> 00:58:16,810
See in my world,
when you're a comic,

1375
00:58:17,080 --> 00:58:19,480
you think that you only come home 
Mondays and Tuesdays.

1376
00:58:19,600 --> 00:58:22,270
So if I work on Mondays and Tuesdays and
what's that gonna do for me?

1377
00:58:22,540 --> 00:58:23,920
Nothing.
Not True.

1378
00:58:24,130 --> 00:58:26,590
Even two days a week [inaudible].
I didn't know that.

1379
00:58:27,040 --> 00:58:28,960
That's the mentality I took him like,
you know what?

1380
00:58:29,770 --> 00:58:34,770
I'm fucking snow blow.
And the sick thing was that always kind 

1381
00:58:34,770 --> 00:58:34,770
of worked out at the.
I always lift the weights.

1382
00:58:34,770 --> 00:58:35,770
I always did fucking something.
You know what I'm saying?

1383
00:58:35,771 --> 00:58:40,771
I wasn't like,
so that's why when I got sick and 

1384
00:58:40,771 --> 00:58:42,511
bothering me,
but I felt like I was too much behind 

1385
00:58:42,511 --> 00:58:42,511
the eight ball get you're about to get 
knee surgery.

1386
00:58:42,550 --> 00:58:44,120
Fuck yeah.
And I'm ready.

1387
00:58:44,121 --> 00:58:45,880
I just,
like I explained to you yesterday,

1388
00:58:45,910 --> 00:58:47,500
you fainted on the way up from the 
fucking.

1389
00:58:47,540 --> 00:58:49,870
You don't even feel limitation.
I mean it's 2012.

1390
00:58:50,080 --> 00:58:52,360
These new vampires.
You don't even feel the fucking needles.

1391
00:58:52,840 --> 00:58:56,560
They could fuck you in the ass 80 times 
and you won't even know it no more.

1392
00:58:56,800 --> 00:59:01,800
Listen,
I put San Tan on my ipod and I looked 

1393
00:59:01,800 --> 00:59:02,710
the other way and two minutes later the 
bitch bent my fucking arm up.

1394
00:59:02,740 --> 00:59:07,030
I didn't feel the fucking needle.
I didn't feel the fucking need ipad.

1395
00:59:07,130 --> 00:59:09,280
You put an ipod all the time.
When I go to the dentist,

1396
00:59:09,281 --> 00:59:12,550
I put something on why sit there and 
look at Bela Lugosi when I could fucking

1397
00:59:13,540 --> 00:59:18,540
every fucking dentist look like Bela 
Lugosi to me when they're looking at 

1398
00:59:18,540 --> 00:59:18,540
your fucking mouth.
You know what I'm saying?

1399
00:59:18,540 --> 00:59:19,720
You don't feel rude,
but just tuning out,

1400
00:59:19,800 --> 00:59:24,350
know that most dentists have tvs.
My fucking wife goes to a place that has

1401
00:59:24,351 --> 00:59:29,351
fucking big screen tvs with headphones 
and one dentist because he would ask me 

1402
00:59:29,351 --> 00:59:31,650
stupid.
You know,

1403
00:59:31,690 --> 00:59:34,510
he was just uncomfortable.
I'd have like really bad conversation,

1404
00:59:34,511 --> 00:59:36,370
like clunky conversations with them.

1405
00:59:36,410 --> 00:59:38,630
I was like,
when you get your fingers in my mouth,

1406
00:59:38,660 --> 00:59:41,420
what is the talk about listening?
Let's understand each other.

1407
00:59:41,450 --> 00:59:46,450
I'm going to lay back and open my mouth.
Tap me when a tap me when I'm fucking 

1408
00:59:46,450 --> 00:59:50,691
done enough.
Tap you if it hurts because that's what 

1409
00:59:50,691 --> 00:59:50,691
they say.
Tap.

1410
00:59:50,691 --> 00:59:50,691
When you feel the drill or something,
you put the fucking ipod on.

1411
00:59:50,730 --> 00:59:51,530
You.
Close your eyes.

1412
00:59:51,531 --> 00:59:53,650
You're not in there.
Eddie Bravo.

1413
00:59:53,651 --> 00:59:54,660
What's happening?
Cock suck.

1414
00:59:55,090 --> 00:59:57,940
You're a month away from having a kid.
You're sitting there like fucking Buddha

1415
00:59:57,941 --> 00:59:59,770
with no fucking food.
Talk to me.

1416
01:00:00,950 --> 01:00:02,920
I love ready for this man.
Are you ready?

1417
01:00:03,020 --> 01:00:05,110
You got to be fucking ready.
Don't this shit?

1418
01:00:05,111 --> 01:00:06,310
Hell yeah.
You got to be ready.

1419
01:00:06,340 --> 01:00:09,790
Have you picked a name yet?
A TV show on discovery.

1420
01:00:10,030 --> 01:00:15,030
I want you to tell me you went to your 
uncle's house and change some diapers 

1421
01:00:15,030 --> 01:00:15,510
for awhile and we tried that.

1422
01:00:15,730 --> 01:00:16,810
Well,
this was planned.

1423
01:00:16,840 --> 01:00:20,650
This was not an accident.
I want her to kid.

1424
01:00:21,290 --> 01:00:26,290
I'm proud of you.
I'm happy if it's going to be a 

1425
01:00:26,290 --> 01:00:26,290
fascinating experience,
man.

1426
01:00:27,120 --> 01:00:30,280
A different fucking man for sure changed
me as a human being.

1427
01:00:30,400 --> 01:00:32,080
First of all was the refund.
When you came to me,

1428
01:00:32,081 --> 01:00:34,120
you said you had the best ice cream 
Sundae in your life.

1429
01:00:35,830 --> 01:00:36,880
The way you gave it.
To me,

1430
01:00:36,881 --> 01:00:38,650
that was beautiful.
And then next thing you know,

1431
01:00:38,651 --> 01:00:40,570
Mrs Rogan came on the scene.
I seen the whole thing.

1432
01:00:40,600 --> 01:00:43,300
I will never forget that day Eddie Bravo
got me high.

1433
01:00:43,640 --> 01:00:47,650
We we went and had an ice cream Sundae 
and I had the most massive revelation in

1434
01:00:47,651 --> 01:00:50,350
my life.
I couldn't believe how God damn good.

1435
01:00:50,351 --> 01:00:54,310
That ice cream Sundae taste was the 
first time he ever straightened up.

1436
01:00:54,311 --> 01:00:59,311
Before then,
you were fucking ape was still bent 

1437
01:00:59,311 --> 01:00:59,311
over.
If I drew you a banana,

1438
01:00:59,311 --> 01:01:01,150
you need to fucking pill.
Seriously.

1439
01:01:03,350 --> 01:01:05,890
When you were back,
you were back.

1440
01:01:05,920 --> 01:01:07,470
Your chest was up.
Well,

1441
01:01:07,480 --> 01:01:12,480
you guys know me.
I don't know me as well as you guys 

1442
01:01:12,480 --> 01:01:12,480
know.
Please.

1443
01:01:12,480 --> 01:01:14,280
That was it.
You will walk different person.

1444
01:01:14,281 --> 01:01:17,220
I'm a lot more relaxed and everything,
but it must've been interesting.

1445
01:01:17,700 --> 01:01:20,670
Much more for you to watch someone 
change their personality.

1446
01:01:21,240 --> 01:01:22,620
So fucking beautiful thing,
man.

1447
01:01:22,621 --> 01:01:24,210
I love to see evolution.
I,

1448
01:01:24,240 --> 01:01:26,710
but people watch it.
I love to watch people.

1449
01:01:26,730 --> 01:01:31,440
Shut your fucking mouth.
Let him walk into that whole,

1450
01:01:31,860 --> 01:01:33,180
you know,
don't say no,

1451
01:01:33,210 --> 01:01:34,720
but I think coming from,
you know,

1452
01:01:35,040 --> 01:01:36,300
my background,
you know,

1453
01:01:36,330 --> 01:01:41,330
like doing martial arts competitions my 
whole life and then just transition 

1454
01:01:41,330 --> 01:01:42,270
right into comedy.
I had never relaxed.

1455
01:01:42,330 --> 01:01:43,680
I never settled down.
I never,

1456
01:01:43,681 --> 01:01:46,350
I never learned how to just be calm,
you know?

1457
01:01:46,530 --> 01:01:49,320
It was my,
my whole body and my brain,

1458
01:01:49,321 --> 01:01:52,320
my personality all developed under 
duress.

1459
01:01:52,560 --> 01:01:57,120
It all developed under physical combat 
all the time on a regular basis.

1460
01:01:57,180 --> 01:01:59,190
Constant training,
constant fight,

1461
01:01:59,191 --> 01:02:00,260
constant tournament's.
That was,

1462
01:02:00,420 --> 01:02:03,510
that was my life from the time I was 15 
until I was 22.

1463
01:02:03,511 --> 01:02:08,511
All my formative years was all spent in 
stress and I remember when I first 

1464
01:02:08,511 --> 01:02:09,540
decided that I wasn't going to fight 
anymore.

1465
01:02:09,541 --> 01:02:11,880
I was like the first time ever in my 
life when I was like 22,

1466
01:02:12,020 --> 01:02:13,680
my,
my last kickboxing fights.

1467
01:02:14,120 --> 01:02:16,470
I've the first time ever where I could 
relax.

1468
01:02:16,800 --> 01:02:18,090
I would always be nervous.
Like,

1469
01:02:18,091 --> 01:02:20,190
when is the next?
When's the next fight?

1470
01:02:20,191 --> 01:02:21,810
When's the next thing I've got to get in
shape.

1471
01:02:21,811 --> 01:02:23,450
I can't be drinking this.
I can't be doing this.

1472
01:02:23,730 --> 01:02:28,730
Couldn't live my life because I was 
always worrying about getting my ass 

1473
01:02:28,730 --> 01:02:28,730
kicked.
I was always worrying about like,

1474
01:02:28,730 --> 01:02:30,300
I have to make sure that I do everything
right or to be prepared.

1475
01:02:30,301 --> 01:02:31,830
I don't want to get fucked up,
you know?

1476
01:02:31,831 --> 01:02:32,710
So it's like,
it's,

1477
01:02:33,150 --> 01:02:36,740
it wasn't the best mindset to go into 
stand up comedy for,

1478
01:02:36,760 --> 01:02:41,760
that's for sure.
It's like a constant battle because 

1479
01:02:41,760 --> 01:02:41,760
stand up comedy,
you've got to totally the opposite.

1480
01:02:41,760 --> 01:02:42,720
You've got to not give a fuck.
You know,

1481
01:02:42,721 --> 01:02:47,721
you gotta you gotta be relaxed.
You gotTa have fun instead of be tents 

1482
01:02:47,721 --> 01:02:48,120
and ready to go at any moment's notice.
You know,

1483
01:02:48,200 --> 01:02:49,580
you sent me a.
by the way,

1484
01:02:49,581 --> 01:02:50,930
whatever you sent me,
it doesn't work.

1485
01:02:50,960 --> 01:02:52,400
One of them doesn't work.
The other two do.

1486
01:02:53,750 --> 01:02:58,750
Check your email.
You sent me two things and both of them 

1487
01:02:58,750 --> 01:02:58,850
are like movies that are one second 
long.

1488
01:02:59,000 --> 01:03:00,840
What?
Here

1489
01:03:03,520 --> 01:03:04,570
again dude,
I know it's.

1490
01:03:04,620 --> 01:03:06,400
I know it's good.
My full reascended okay.

1491
01:03:06,810 --> 01:03:10,380
Fucking 15 to 22.
My mind wasn't fighting them.

1492
01:03:10,400 --> 01:03:12,640
I wasn't a fighter,
but I was in a different type of hell.

1493
01:03:12,641 --> 01:03:14,590
I was in my own head.
I was putting myself into,

1494
01:03:14,591 --> 01:03:17,230
you know,
it was so weird when I became a comic,

1495
01:03:17,231 --> 01:03:17,680
what,
six,

1496
01:03:17,681 --> 01:03:19,570
seven,
eight years later or something like that

1497
01:03:20,290 --> 01:03:25,290
and how I took that wildness into the 
fucking comment and nobody understood 

1498
01:03:25,301 --> 01:03:27,280
what I was saying until I met you guys 
store.

1499
01:03:27,900 --> 01:03:29,680
I filed the fucking home.
I was always.

1500
01:03:29,681 --> 01:03:33,060
I used to travel on the road with trible
and do all these little roads.

1501
01:03:33,080 --> 01:03:34,870
I remember when I first met you,
the store,

1502
01:03:34,871 --> 01:03:36,720
everybody was fucking terrified to you.
Yeah,

1503
01:03:36,721 --> 01:03:39,710
it was crazy.
Nobody knew you and I,

1504
01:03:39,720 --> 01:03:43,750
I remember being like the only guy,
like when I first met you,

1505
01:03:43,751 --> 01:03:44,860
that was like,
he's great.

1506
01:03:44,890 --> 01:03:46,300
What are you talking about?
I love that guy.

1507
01:03:46,570 --> 01:03:47,230
I never was like,
Oh,

1508
01:03:47,231 --> 01:03:48,230
here comes Julie Diaz.
Like,

1509
01:03:48,250 --> 01:03:53,250
where's he at?
I like with gravitate towards you 

1510
01:03:53,250 --> 01:03:53,290
because you didn't scare me.
You were nice to me.

1511
01:03:54,270 --> 01:03:57,040
You weren't a scary guy to me.
You were a regular dude.

1512
01:03:57,480 --> 01:03:59,650
I see.
You were like one of the only guys there

1513
01:03:59,651 --> 01:04:04,651
that I could relate to.
There was like a lot of guys that I 

1514
01:04:04,651 --> 01:04:04,651
couldn't relate to.
I knew dudes like you,

1515
01:04:04,651 --> 01:04:04,651
you know,
I mean,

1516
01:04:04,651 --> 01:04:06,880
not you,
but you and my friend Johnny B,

1517
01:04:06,881 --> 01:04:09,130
the Pool Hustler,
very similar characters,

1518
01:04:09,131 --> 01:04:10,090
man.
Very,

1519
01:04:10,091 --> 01:04:12,730
very similar characters.
You have both way out there.

1520
01:04:12,970 --> 01:04:17,970
You both like not give a fuck guys,
and you're both guys that were like 

1521
01:04:17,970 --> 01:04:21,540
polarizing.
Some people would love you to death and 

1522
01:04:21,540 --> 01:04:21,540
then everybody,
you know,

1523
01:04:21,540 --> 01:04:22,240
there was a lot,
a large group of people,

1524
01:04:22,241 --> 01:04:24,040
but for whatever reason,
they'd be upset at you.

1525
01:04:24,190 --> 01:04:29,190
Like I remember having to defend you.
Even I rare even dom irrera was hating 

1526
01:04:29,190 --> 01:04:30,580
on you for every body,
every and I loved it.

1527
01:04:30,581 --> 01:04:32,220
I fucking love that because that's what 
I,

1528
01:04:32,510 --> 01:04:37,510
you know,
it's so weird that this whole surgery 

1529
01:04:37,510 --> 01:04:39,451
thing really taught me about fear.
My fear has fucking done wonders for me 

1530
01:04:39,970 --> 01:04:41,700
because that's why when I wake up in the
Molesta,

1531
01:04:41,740 --> 01:04:46,740
first thing I fucking do is grab my 
fucking cock because for years I was 

1532
01:04:46,740 --> 01:04:51,691
scared.
I've always insecure that immigrant 

1533
01:04:51,691 --> 01:04:52,630
fucking thing shizzle into my fucking 
mind.

1534
01:04:52,830 --> 01:04:56,080
Since the streets in New York City with 
the immigrant thing,

1535
01:04:56,081 --> 01:05:01,081
not knowing the language,
not feeling good enough like everybody 

1536
01:05:01,081 --> 01:05:03,571
else,
not beat a fucking American and it sits 

1537
01:05:03,571 --> 01:05:04,960
inside my fucking soul.
So for me everything has been riveted on

1538
01:05:04,961 --> 01:05:06,760
fear.
Every time I get on stage,

1539
01:05:06,761 --> 01:05:09,610
it's like the other night fear was real 
in Chicago.

1540
01:05:09,610 --> 01:05:13,330
I got on stage in between the reefer and
whatever was going on and the lights.

1541
01:05:13,390 --> 01:05:15,400
I got fearful man,
but you know what?

1542
01:05:15,401 --> 01:05:18,130
That's normal to be scared.
That's a great emotion,

1543
01:05:18,131 --> 01:05:21,970
especially when you're a stand up comic 
because the more scared you are,

1544
01:05:22,120 --> 01:05:24,850
the better you're going to fucking do.
Especially in my case,

1545
01:05:24,851 --> 01:05:27,940
the more riled up I am.
Two minutes before I go on stage,

1546
01:05:28,240 --> 01:05:30,370
the more energy I'm gonna give that 
fucking audience.

1547
01:05:30,610 --> 01:05:35,610
But I've looked at my life and I've seen
how much fear I was petrified to go get 

1548
01:05:35,610 --> 01:05:37,920
that fucking needle even though I 
fucking knew nothing was going to happen

1549
01:05:37,921 --> 01:05:40,270
and I was going to walk out of there,
but I went in.

1550
01:05:40,271 --> 01:05:42,060
I took the needle after I walked out at 
me like,

1551
01:05:42,070 --> 01:05:47,070
what a fucking killed 10 fucking people 
with my bare hands because you overcome 

1552
01:05:47,070 --> 01:05:47,230
one of your biggest fucking fears.

1553
01:05:47,470 --> 01:05:49,840
Till this day I get little emails and 
people,

1554
01:05:49,841 --> 01:05:50,640
you know,
I,

1555
01:05:50,641 --> 01:05:51,790
I suffer,
I suffer,

1556
01:05:51,820 --> 01:05:56,820
I suffer from a social disorder and I 
don't know what to do with the answer 

1557
01:05:56,820 --> 01:06:00,291
and taking a fucking pill.
It's checking your fucking confidence 

1558
01:06:00,291 --> 01:06:00,850
and grabbing your balls and walking into
a circle and saying,

1559
01:06:01,060 --> 01:06:02,080
fuck it.
I'm here.

1560
01:06:02,350 --> 01:06:07,350
You know,
my mentality was always go into the 

1561
01:06:07,350 --> 01:06:07,960
mouth of the lion and put a chair down 
and sit the fuck down and let the pieces

1562
01:06:07,961 --> 01:06:12,961
fall where they may.
And if you're not going to live like 

1563
01:06:12,961 --> 01:06:12,961
that,
fuck them more.

1564
01:06:12,961 --> 01:06:12,961
I'm at the store too.
Fucking nights,

1565
01:06:12,961 --> 01:06:17,761
Joe Rogan.
The first fucking night Eddie Griffin 

1566
01:06:17,761 --> 01:06:17,761
bumps me.
You know how embarrassing that is?

1567
01:06:17,761 --> 01:06:19,750
You become a regular on a Sunday.
The first fucking night you let bring 11

1568
01:06:19,751 --> 01:06:24,751
people that come see you.
Your landlord comes and you get bumped 

1569
01:06:24,751 --> 01:06:26,590
by Eddie Griffin and the second night I 
go up there and Steve Greenstein says to

1570
01:06:26,591 --> 01:06:26,920
me,
Hey,

1571
01:06:26,921 --> 01:06:29,520
last weekend you fucking audition here 
for missing.

1572
01:06:29,530 --> 01:06:31,410
You said one of my jokes.
I said,

1573
01:06:31,420 --> 01:06:35,230
it's February 11th.
I just come off a plane January 29th and

1574
01:06:35,231 --> 01:06:37,150
you're already accusing me of being a 
fucking thief.

1575
01:06:37,360 --> 01:06:39,310
And remember he had his violin case.
Who?

1576
01:06:39,400 --> 01:06:40,950
Steve Greenstein,
I don't remember.

1577
01:06:41,030 --> 01:06:42,100
What was it?
Creepy guy.

1578
01:06:42,101 --> 01:06:44,740
Older guy that hung out at the comedy 
store and he had a violin case.

1579
01:06:44,980 --> 01:06:47,920
So this is a Tuesday night.
It's black night at the comedy store.

1580
01:06:48,130 --> 01:06:53,130
It's 8:00.
The main room is packed with the 

1581
01:06:53,130 --> 01:06:55,051
original room would be empty because 
people were scared to go up there and 

1582
01:06:55,051 --> 01:06:55,051
black knight because we're going to get 
fucking mug.

1583
01:06:55,051 --> 01:06:58,180
So the original room was always empty.
So Steve Greensteam was up before me.

1584
01:06:58,480 --> 01:06:59,610
He,
this is my second night,

1585
01:06:59,620 --> 01:07:01,330
the comedy store.
I just got away.

1586
01:07:01,690 --> 01:07:03,370
I'm a fucking criminal.
I've been in prison.

1587
01:07:03,371 --> 01:07:04,640
I got all these problems,
but I,

1588
01:07:04,670 --> 01:07:07,500
for the first time in my life I got a 
little fucking daylight.

1589
01:07:07,500 --> 01:07:09,910
The comedy store,
this lady made me a regular all my life.

1590
01:07:09,911 --> 01:07:12,790
People were like [inaudible] in you as 
Mitzi shore scene you.

1591
01:07:13,010 --> 01:07:14,920
She going to make you a fucking regular.
I get down there.

1592
01:07:15,190 --> 01:07:17,160
I'm a regular is the first time since my
mother died.

1593
01:07:17,161 --> 01:07:18,550
I had any luck.
I had been in prison.

1594
01:07:18,551 --> 01:07:19,970
I had been divorced,
you know,

1595
01:07:19,990 --> 01:07:22,810
shot the whole fucking deal and the next
thing you know,

1596
01:07:22,811 --> 01:07:27,811
I become a regular.
It's Tuesday night and I get off stage 

1597
01:07:27,811 --> 01:07:31,110
and I'm waiting to hang out for a little
while and Steve Greenstein comes up to 

1598
01:07:31,110 --> 01:07:31,110
me and he says to me,
dog,

1599
01:07:31,110 --> 01:07:32,770
one of your jokes is like my joke.
I said,

1600
01:07:32,771 --> 01:07:37,771
which one?
He said something about Oj Simpson's 

1601
01:07:37,771 --> 01:07:37,771
made.
I go,

1602
01:07:37,771 --> 01:07:37,771
Doug,
I didn't steal the joke for me.

1603
01:07:37,771 --> 01:07:40,130
I just fucking got here two weeks ago.
Wheels comes out.

1604
01:07:40,140 --> 01:07:42,010
He goes,
this guy didn't steal the joke from you.

1605
01:07:42,250 --> 01:07:45,420
The only problem was the guy put the 
violin case behind this fucking legs and

1606
01:07:45,421 --> 01:07:47,650
I spotted it.
So he starts threatening me.

1607
01:07:47,660 --> 01:07:49,270
He's like,
don't even next time you do that job,

1608
01:07:49,271 --> 01:07:51,070
we're going to have a problem.
I just pushed him.

1609
01:07:51,071 --> 01:07:52,810
Joe Rogan.
He fell over the violin case.

1610
01:07:52,830 --> 01:07:55,570
Why has these fallen down?
Mitsis Limo pulls up.

1611
01:07:56,770 --> 01:07:57,730
That's it.
I'm like,

1612
01:07:57,731 --> 01:07:58,990
I'm done.
This is my life.

1613
01:07:58,991 --> 01:08:03,991
I'm fucking Gone Outta here.
I'm never going to get another fucking 

1614
01:08:03,991 --> 01:08:04,210
spot again.
I'm going to go back to selling.

1615
01:08:04,211 --> 01:08:09,211
Fucking blow and wheels got between us.
Scott Day got between us and Mitzi came 

1616
01:08:09,340 --> 01:08:10,140
and go,
oh,

1617
01:08:10,180 --> 01:08:12,490
what happened here?
And he started saying,

1618
01:08:12,491 --> 01:08:13,060
he goes,
no,

1619
01:08:13,061 --> 01:08:14,250
this kid's Cuban,
blah blah,

1620
01:08:14,260 --> 01:08:19,260
blah am.
But Mitzi seen the kid on the floor and 

1621
01:08:19,260 --> 01:08:19,620
fell in love with me after that because 
I pushed that motherfucker.

1622
01:08:19,630 --> 01:08:21,710
She liked something from myself.
Sure.

1623
01:08:21,730 --> 01:08:22,220
You got lucky.

1624
01:08:22,220 --> 01:08:27,220
She was crazy.
She liked that happened at the FEC and 

1625
01:08:27,220 --> 01:08:30,611
Improv.
I would've been out on the fucking 

1626
01:08:30,611 --> 01:08:30,611
street.
How often did you perform at the Improv?

1627
01:08:30,611 --> 01:08:32,570
Now in those days?
In those days.

1628
01:08:32,571 --> 01:08:35,390
Every week because the Guy Richard 
Cooper loved me,

1629
01:08:35,391 --> 01:08:38,300
the talent coordinator,
but I got to La January 29th.

1630
01:08:38,330 --> 01:08:40,940
That was a regular at the store.
February 19th on my birthday.

1631
01:08:41,150 --> 01:08:42,860
I didn't fuck around this town when I 
got it,

1632
01:08:43,910 --> 01:08:45,920
but you couldn't do the Improv and Mitzi
found out,

1633
01:08:45,921 --> 01:08:47,060
but I went to Scott.
Dan said,

1634
01:08:47,061 --> 01:08:48,530
dog.
Richard Cooper gives me spots.

1635
01:08:49,010 --> 01:08:51,200
So I would go over there and I had a 
couple of problems over there.

1636
01:08:51,201 --> 01:08:56,201
Right off the bat.
People thought they were cute over 

1637
01:08:56,201 --> 01:08:56,201
there.
You know,

1638
01:08:56,201 --> 01:08:56,330
you leave your fucking girlfriend and a 
seat.

1639
01:08:56,331 --> 01:09:01,331
You go to bat and you come back and 
talking to them like they know that is 

1640
01:09:01,331 --> 01:09:01,331
an,
it's a fucking issue.

1641
01:09:01,331 --> 01:09:02,270
And you gotta you gotTa stop.
I'm like,

1642
01:09:02,271 --> 01:09:07,271
I told you like Hitler in Munich or not,
you're going to have a fucking problem 

1643
01:09:07,271 --> 01:09:07,290
dog.
So I would say things to people and uh,

1644
01:09:07,300 --> 01:09:09,020
all of a sudden you're a bad fucking 
person.

1645
01:09:09,440 --> 01:09:11,210
So what the fuck?
I don't give a fuck.

1646
01:09:11,270 --> 01:09:13,850
And we're here 12 years later and we're 
still rocking and rolling.

1647
01:09:13,851 --> 01:09:15,770
They could still suck my dick and call 
me shortly.

1648
01:09:15,860 --> 01:09:17,660
We're doing a show.
If you're in town,

1649
01:09:17,661 --> 01:09:19,370
Pasadena,
this Thursday night,

1650
01:09:19,810 --> 01:09:24,080
I'm don't come if you're a stalker.
Thanks Pasadena Ice House.

1651
01:09:24,081 --> 01:09:25,430
Thursday night.
What Time Brian?

1652
01:09:25,490 --> 01:09:28,190
A dirty Joey Diaz.
Joe Rogan,

1653
01:09:28,191 --> 01:09:29,630
little esther,
a bunch of other people,

1654
01:09:29,631 --> 01:09:32,450
and we also have a show Friday.
Good ice house comedy.com

1655
01:09:32,451 --> 01:09:33,500
for the tickets.
Oh,

1656
01:09:33,501 --> 01:09:37,550
snap freaks and Vegas Friday night.
Eddie Bravo is coming.

1657
01:09:38,230 --> 01:09:39,960
He's going to play the drums and shit.
You come in.

1658
01:09:41,120 --> 01:09:44,930
We're looking into.
That might go in Saturday morning.

1659
01:09:44,930 --> 01:09:46,210
Not sure,
not sure.

1660
01:09:46,290 --> 01:09:47,300
No,
I'm fucking.

1661
01:09:47,301 --> 01:09:49,760
I'm just central drive and next time I 
go to La.

1662
01:09:49,761 --> 01:09:52,130
I'm not driving this time.
Next time I go to la though,

1663
01:09:52,131 --> 01:09:55,370
I'm driving vegas.
Vegas Memorial Day weekend to see,

1664
01:09:55,371 --> 01:09:58,100
uh,
to see junior dos Santos against my man.

1665
01:09:58,310 --> 01:10:01,820
If he recovers the surgery.
I'm tired of fucking flying man.

1666
01:10:01,860 --> 01:10:04,990
I would rather just take the big flood 
Cadillac escalades.

1667
01:10:05,000 --> 01:10:06,260
Let's go out.
I got a new one.

1668
01:10:06,261 --> 01:10:11,261
I got one of these are going to be 
things with the music and the whole 

1669
01:10:11,261 --> 01:10:11,261
fucking thing.
Hey Brian,

1670
01:10:11,261 --> 01:10:11,261
come here.
Help me.

1671
01:10:11,261 --> 01:10:12,980
You can export these things.
It's not exporting,

1672
01:10:12,981 --> 01:10:14,450
right?
But then they'll pull us over like snoop

1673
01:10:14,451 --> 01:10:19,451
Dogg,
those cocks up because every time they 

1674
01:10:19,451 --> 01:10:19,910
see snoop Dogg,
if they smell you anywhere near them,

1675
01:10:20,390 --> 01:10:21,620
we're going to jail.
It's right here.

1676
01:10:22,680 --> 01:10:26,240
What a shotgun.
The fucking house.

1677
01:10:26,241 --> 01:10:28,340
I retrieved the video.
Denny Pluto posters here,

1678
01:10:28,880 --> 01:10:32,150
fresh off his fucking 19 Wednesday,
Sunday grants.

1679
01:10:32,190 --> 01:10:32,880
Enough flights.

1680
01:10:33,290 --> 01:10:38,290
It was a epic day for 10.
What was the gracie nationals at the 

1681
01:10:38,290 --> 01:10:42,790
gracie nationals.
Was was an la this past Sunday.

1682
01:10:42,910 --> 01:10:46,780
And Rose Gracie,
the granddaughter of Heleo Gracie,

1683
01:10:47,020 --> 01:10:52,020
the grandmaster Gracie Jujitsu.
She decided to go old school with the 

1684
01:10:52,800 --> 01:10:57,800
gracie nationals.
She's been running it for the last few 

1685
01:10:57,800 --> 01:10:57,800
years and she,
you know,

1686
01:10:57,800 --> 01:10:59,590
the whole point system that Jujitsu 
tournaments,

1687
01:10:59,670 --> 01:11:00,520
um,
uh,

1688
01:11:00,521 --> 01:11:04,540
run by or just ridiculous.
I mean it's just people are fighting for

1689
01:11:04,541 --> 01:11:07,330
points and stalling and it's,
it's ridiculous.

1690
01:11:07,331 --> 01:11:09,820
And Roads Gracie decided to,
you know,

1691
01:11:10,470 --> 01:11:15,470
make her or the great or late great 
helio gracie proud and make an all just 

1692
01:11:17,760 --> 01:11:20,170
a submission only tournament.
And these,

1693
01:11:20,200 --> 01:11:22,000
these tournaments are becoming this 
format.

1694
01:11:22,001 --> 01:11:27,001
It's becoming more and more popular.
They do it in the Pacific north 

1695
01:11:27,001 --> 01:11:27,001
northwest at,
at,

1696
01:11:27,001 --> 01:11:30,000
at that sub league in Oregon and they 
run smoothly.

1697
01:11:30,001 --> 01:11:35,001
People have been afraid of sub only 
tournaments because of time constraints 

1698
01:11:35,731 --> 01:11:36,420
and all that stuff.

1699
01:11:36,420 --> 01:11:39,480
But rose gracie made it work.
She had the balls to go,

1700
01:11:40,140 --> 01:11:42,060
no points,
no advantages,

1701
01:11:42,150 --> 01:11:46,050
15 minutes a submission only if,
if,

1702
01:11:46,290 --> 01:11:48,990
if you go 15 minutes without a 
submission,

1703
01:11:48,991 --> 01:11:51,750
both competitors are out of the 
tournament.

1704
01:11:52,080 --> 01:11:55,170
So that's the ballsy as format there is 
out there.

1705
01:11:55,470 --> 01:11:57,750
And,
and now the gracie nationals is the most

1706
01:11:57,840 --> 01:12:01,260
prestigious submission only tournament 
on the planet.

1707
01:12:01,560 --> 01:12:05,550
And I think that's the future for 
Jujitsu cause you know,

1708
01:12:05,551 --> 01:12:08,880
it was a lot more fun preparing for a 
submission only tournament.

1709
01:12:09,400 --> 01:12:14,400
All we worked on was the fun stuff.
The good stuff about Jujitsu that the 

1710
01:12:14,400 --> 01:12:18,321
finish,
the closing the deal that we're working 

1711
01:12:18,321 --> 01:12:19,550
on,
our squeeze for the Nogi Worlds.

1712
01:12:20,320 --> 01:12:23,520
Um,
we had to spend time working on stalling

1713
01:12:23,521 --> 01:12:28,521
techniques because when you're playing a
point game and it's like six minute 

1714
01:12:28,521 --> 01:12:32,091
matches,
a guy will get a point or just a little 

1715
01:12:32,091 --> 01:12:32,250
advantage,
which is even less than a point.

1716
01:12:32,280 --> 01:12:37,280
And once they're up an advantage,
the hold and they won't do anything and 

1717
01:12:37,280 --> 01:12:39,540
people aren't used to wrestling with 
guys that are just holding,

1718
01:12:39,541 --> 01:12:42,750
holding onto leads in class.
You don't just hold onto a lead,

1719
01:12:42,751 --> 01:12:44,520
there's no one's counting points in 
class.

1720
01:12:44,521 --> 01:12:49,521
So you actually have to prepare for that
yet specifically prepare for tournaments

1721
01:12:49,651 --> 01:12:53,820
that are run by points and um,
it's just so not fun.

1722
01:12:53,821 --> 01:12:58,680
Preparing like stalling techniques and 
stalling live drills and prepare.

1723
01:12:58,681 --> 01:13:00,540
What are the do just hold on.
It doesn't do anything.

1724
01:13:00,750 --> 01:13:05,750
It's ridiculous.
So rose gracie decided to eliminate all 

1725
01:13:05,750 --> 01:13:09,831
of that and make the gracie nationals a 
submission only tournament.

1726
01:13:10,560 --> 01:13:15,560
And um,
she's also doing the Gracie worlds in 

1727
01:13:15,560 --> 01:13:17,460
July,
July 15th in San Jose.

1728
01:13:17,790 --> 01:13:18,870
You know,
finally,

1729
01:13:19,180 --> 01:13:24,180
you know,
you're going to be able to get a world 

1730
01:13:24,180 --> 01:13:25,380
title in a submission only format,
which is the greatest.

1731
01:13:25,381 --> 01:13:26,820
I mean,
it's so much.

1732
01:13:26,850 --> 01:13:31,140
It means so much more to win in a 
submission only tournament.

1733
01:13:31,290 --> 01:13:36,290
Then by points you're a world champion 
and you won by an advantage world 

1734
01:13:36,781 --> 01:13:41,781
champion at those days.
It does nothing for the development of 

1735
01:13:41,781 --> 01:13:46,581
your Jujitsu.
It just gets you better at holding and 

1736
01:13:46,581 --> 01:13:46,581
installing out and running out the 
clock.

1737
01:13:46,581 --> 01:13:48,540
It's just ridiculous.
So mad.

1738
01:13:48,541 --> 01:13:53,490
Huge props to Rose Gray and her husband,
Hobie Vasquez,

1739
01:13:53,610 --> 01:13:57,000
who put this tournament together and you
know,

1740
01:13:58,140 --> 01:14:03,140
I think this is the future.
I think a submission only format is the 

1741
01:14:03,140 --> 01:14:03,140
only way to go.
You know,

1742
01:14:03,240 --> 01:14:06,520
we're taking bias refs completely out of
the gate.

1743
01:14:06,810 --> 01:14:08,740
The refs have nothing to do with the 
game.

1744
01:14:09,590 --> 01:14:14,590
No,
well there's no time limited in the 

1745
01:14:14,590 --> 01:14:16,351
final,
but in the qualifying matches is a 15 

1746
01:14:16,351 --> 01:14:17,740
minute time limit,
which is plenty enough to have plenty of

1747
01:14:17,741 --> 01:14:22,741
time.
And if there is no submission in those 

1748
01:14:22,741 --> 01:14:22,750
15 minutes,
both guys are out.

1749
01:14:22,750 --> 01:14:23,680
So it's,
it's amazing.

1750
01:14:23,681 --> 01:14:28,681
We had sold are out.
So if two guys are just like Marcello 

1751
01:14:28,681 --> 01:14:29,830
Garcia and jake shields stall each other
out,

1752
01:14:29,831 --> 01:14:31,060
they're both out.
Whoa,

1753
01:14:31,061 --> 01:14:32,560
that's crazy.
But in the finals,

1754
01:14:32,620 --> 01:14:36,790
no time that we had some epic matches.
Epic matches,

1755
01:14:37,380 --> 01:14:42,380
um,
10 planet San Francisco went 12 and one 

1756
01:14:42,380 --> 01:14:42,380
I wish I had about,
you know,

1757
01:14:42,380 --> 01:14:45,550
maybe how many affiliates you got now I 
got to over 30.

1758
01:14:45,551 --> 01:14:47,350
I lose track.
Isn't that crazy?

1759
01:14:47,500 --> 01:14:50,140
You started out just doing it as 
something to do,

1760
01:14:50,440 --> 01:14:50,980
you know,
like,

1761
01:14:51,010 --> 01:14:51,640
man,
what should I do?

1762
01:14:51,641 --> 01:14:54,850
Maybe I could teach now and then boom.
Now you got like an empire,

1763
01:14:55,510 --> 01:14:56,650
man.
It was all an accident.

1764
01:14:56,680 --> 01:15:01,680
It's weird in a weird.
I thought I thought that that when we 

1765
01:15:01,680 --> 01:15:04,621
were working on the man show,
we were going to parlay that into some 

1766
01:15:04,621 --> 01:15:04,621
trey parker.
Matt Stone.

1767
01:15:04,621 --> 01:15:05,110
Shit,
you know,

1768
01:15:05,820 --> 01:15:09,240
it was all a dream.
I used to read word up magazine,

1769
01:15:09,241 --> 01:15:10,020
Salt,
pepper,

1770
01:15:10,021 --> 01:15:15,021
heavy d up in the limousine.
The next thing we're gonna do is we're 

1771
01:15:15,021 --> 01:15:18,261
going to get a fucking comedy club.
I decided while I was taking a shit 

1772
01:15:18,261 --> 01:15:18,261
today,
high as fuck on the toilet bowl.

1773
01:15:18,261 --> 01:15:22,710
That's the next move.
The next move is a reality show about,

1774
01:15:23,340 --> 01:15:25,890
about this fucking place,
about doing,

1775
01:15:25,920 --> 01:15:30,920
doing a podcast and doing a comedy club 
and have an all connected the way we do 

1776
01:15:30,920 --> 01:15:30,960
it,
man,

1777
01:15:30,961 --> 01:15:32,670
when we have this show,
so Thursday night

1778
01:15:32,910 --> 01:15:37,910
we have podcasts going on at the same 
time as the comedy show and everybody 

1779
01:15:37,910 --> 01:15:42,651
just rotates in.
It's the greatest fucking thing we've 

1780
01:15:42,651 --> 01:15:42,651
ever done.
The greatest thing we've ever done.

1781
01:15:42,651 --> 01:15:43,050
The perfect thing.
You go on stage,

1782
01:15:43,051 --> 01:15:43,790
man,
you're.

1783
01:15:43,860 --> 01:15:48,860
You're already flowing.
Like when you had to go on stage right 

1784
01:15:48,860 --> 01:15:48,860
now.

1785
01:15:48,860 --> 01:15:52,090
Yeah.
You'll be able to show the Lucy snore 

1786
01:15:52,090 --> 01:15:52,090
brush story.
What is it?

1787
01:15:52,090 --> 01:15:52,090
What's the name?
Lucy Snowe Bush.

1788
01:15:52,090 --> 01:15:56,440
If you have,
you told that Lucy snore Bush story and 

1789
01:15:56,440 --> 01:15:57,300
then when of the stage right now you 
would be in private.

1790
01:15:57,301 --> 01:15:59,690
That's the most ridiculous thing I've 
ever told.

1791
01:15:59,910 --> 01:16:02,120
Greatest story of all time.
People want Root Lucy Snore,

1792
01:16:02,121 --> 01:16:07,121
Bush tee shirts all by broken aluise 
store machines room and eight or asked 

1793
01:16:07,121 --> 01:16:07,610
the middle of the night.
They want that tee shirt.

1794
01:16:07,970 --> 01:16:11,030
Oh my fucking God.
I on here.

1795
01:16:12,330 --> 01:16:14,240
And then we got Vegas Friday.
Fucking night.

1796
01:16:14,360 --> 01:16:15,190
Yeah,
we will.

1797
01:16:15,330 --> 01:16:16,610
We were in Chicago.
Like I said,

1798
01:16:16,611 --> 01:16:19,850
this was the biggest show we'd ever done
and it was pretty crazy.

1799
01:16:19,851 --> 01:16:21,500
I made a video how fucking crazy it was.

1800
01:16:22,010 --> 01:16:27,010
Really how big this place is.
I don't know if you can tell.

1801
01:16:32,890 --> 01:16:37,700
Look at the size of this place.
Wow.

1802
01:16:41,330 --> 01:16:44,000
How long did you do?
An hour and 22 minutes.

1803
01:16:50,510 --> 01:16:53,210
We stayed outside and signed pictures 
for fucking hours,

1804
01:16:53,211 --> 01:16:54,890
man.
I had to pay those security.

1805
01:16:54,891 --> 01:16:59,891
I had to pay like 2000 extra dollars in 
security because they had to keep them 

1806
01:16:59,891 --> 01:17:02,060
around because it's like union is like,
you know,

1807
01:17:02,120 --> 01:17:02,840
laws,
you know,

1808
01:17:02,841 --> 01:17:04,340
you have to have rules,
you have to pay.

1809
01:17:04,341 --> 01:17:06,320
People look at the play,
the second one,

1810
01:17:06,530 --> 01:17:08,150
the second video is ridiculous.
We were,

1811
01:17:09,140 --> 01:17:11,100
is when we were signing,
and this is a,

1812
01:17:11,150 --> 01:17:14,390
all this the line of people that were 
waiting to,

1813
01:17:14,391 --> 01:17:14,970
uh,
to,

1814
01:17:15,010 --> 01:17:17,940
to take pictures with,
with Joanne and Dunkin and,

1815
01:17:17,941 --> 01:17:18,490
and,
and,

1816
01:17:18,540 --> 01:17:23,540
and sign posters.
Mike Maxwell made a poster just for the 

1817
01:17:23,540 --> 01:17:25,520
event and a check this shit out.
This is,

1818
01:17:27,260 --> 01:17:28,650
hold on one.
Say,

1819
01:17:28,820 --> 01:17:30,290
okay.
This is bonkers,

1820
01:17:30,291 --> 01:17:35,291
man.
This is when we were in the upstairs 

1821
01:17:35,291 --> 01:17:35,291
balcony area.
This place is fucking huge.

1822
01:17:35,291 --> 01:17:36,920
That Chicago theater at one point in 
time,

1823
01:17:36,921 --> 01:17:38,810
it was a silent movie house.

1824
01:17:39,040 --> 01:17:41,630
It was built in 1921.
Sinatra performed.

1825
01:17:41,631 --> 01:17:46,631
They had several little estis father 
took the mother to the see Sinatra 

1826
01:17:46,631 --> 01:17:47,030
ladies seven.
Holy Shit.

1827
01:17:47,690 --> 01:17:50,220
When he was forgetting his lyrics and 
the wig was crooked shit.

1828
01:17:51,770 --> 01:17:56,770
Motherfucking Sinatra Jack.
It was still banging bitches too with a 

1829
01:17:56,770 --> 01:17:59,270
Sinatra died before Viagra kicked in the
boat.

1830
01:17:59,300 --> 01:18:01,310
He's in the midst of those grumpy old 
men.

1831
01:18:01,311 --> 01:18:03,620
They couldn't get any pussy anymore.
There was no reason to perform.

1832
01:18:04,050 --> 01:18:04,870
You know,
there was,

1833
01:18:04,930 --> 01:18:06,770
it was all over.
Even though it was Sinatra.

1834
01:18:06,771 --> 01:18:11,771
You only got a hard on like once a month
at the end he was still getting pussy 

1835
01:18:11,771 --> 01:18:11,771
with the wig,
like a pimp dog.

1836
01:18:15,840 --> 01:18:16,170
Brian.

1837
01:18:17,430 --> 01:18:18,200
It's obviously something,

1838
01:18:18,210 --> 01:18:19,200
Brian with an iphone.

1839
01:18:20,210 --> 01:18:22,350
The way the iphone interpreted it.
Can't you rotate that?

1840
01:18:22,410 --> 01:18:23,470
No,
not on the flight,

1841
01:18:24,340 --> 01:18:25,680
but look how easy that is.

1842
01:18:26,700 --> 01:18:30,090
You know why it does that right yet?
Because it's a piece of shit.

1843
01:18:30,200 --> 01:18:30,530
No,
no,

1844
01:18:30,531 --> 01:18:32,280
no.
Before you hit record,

1845
01:18:32,400 --> 01:18:34,950
look at the icon.
If it's tilted sideways,

1846
01:18:34,951 --> 01:18:37,860
it's going to record it sideways.
Look how nutty that is.

1847
01:18:37,860 --> 01:18:37,860
That

1848
01:18:37,860 --> 01:18:38,310
is,
man.

1849
01:18:38,340 --> 01:18:43,340
That's just all the people waiting to 
get into or to get into line to take 

1850
01:18:43,340 --> 01:18:44,280
pictures and shit.
That was a fun,

1851
01:18:44,281 --> 01:18:45,900
fun time.
Thank you.

1852
01:18:45,910 --> 01:18:50,910
It was dirty.
Freaked that pulled her tits out and I 

1853
01:18:50,910 --> 01:18:53,141
had everybody sign her tests.
She had great tits.

1854
01:18:53,990 --> 01:18:55,650
Don't don't put it down.
Nice.

1855
01:18:55,651 --> 01:18:58,860
Twenty four year old for a little 
fucking cheese and she was afraid.

1856
01:18:59,450 --> 01:19:00,930
She got a little boy for that.
Looked like fucking.

1857
01:19:00,931 --> 01:19:02,900
What's the guy?
You little bars.

1858
01:19:03,450 --> 01:19:06,860
I just was ready to go.
Yeah,

1859
01:19:07,060 --> 01:19:08,730
it didn't.
Somebody throw the guy under the bus who

1860
01:19:08,731 --> 01:19:11,120
wasn't a Jane and James used to date.
Is that.

1861
01:19:11,250 --> 01:19:12,360
Is that Bruno Mars?
And it stinks.

1862
01:19:12,361 --> 01:19:13,200
That song.
Yeah.

1863
01:19:13,201 --> 01:19:14,520
Well,
Bruno Mars and the other guy,

1864
01:19:14,521 --> 01:19:14,840
right?
Yeah.

1865
01:19:14,940 --> 01:19:17,040
There's two guys who sings.
Who's the other one?

1866
01:19:17,041 --> 01:19:22,041
I can't remember.
There's a the rapper guy and then the 

1867
01:19:22,041 --> 01:19:22,041
singer guy.

1868
01:19:22,041 --> 01:19:23,740
Which one is which?
Great fucking tune.

1869
01:19:23,790 --> 01:19:28,790
Whoever the hell it is.
Did you hear about those English people 

1870
01:19:28,790 --> 01:19:28,790
that got arrested at the airport and.
No,

1871
01:19:28,790 --> 01:19:29,880
you didn't hear about this shit,
dude.

1872
01:19:29,910 --> 01:19:33,000
It's one of the weakest things I've ever
heard ever about.

1873
01:19:33,001 --> 01:19:37,830
The TSA is sad with this country has 
become these English people.

1874
01:19:37,950 --> 01:19:39,630
They were coming over here for a 
vacation,

1875
01:19:39,750 --> 01:19:41,970
so they joked around and they said,
hey,

1876
01:19:42,030 --> 01:19:45,330
we're going to go over to America and 
we're going to fucking destroy America.

1877
01:19:45,331 --> 01:19:47,160
We're going to dig up Marilyn Monroe's 
body.

1878
01:19:47,310 --> 01:19:52,310
I mean,
it sounds like some shit that Joey Diaz 

1879
01:19:52,310 --> 01:19:52,310
would say if he was British.
Right.

1880
01:19:52,310 --> 01:19:52,310
We're going to come over here.
We're gonna.

1881
01:19:52,310 --> 01:19:53,450
Have a fucking party.
This is what they wrote.

1882
01:19:53,460 --> 01:19:55,800
I'm going to destroy America and dig up 
Marilyn Monroe.

1883
01:19:55,890 --> 01:19:59,730
That's what they said on his twitter.
They came over here to party.

1884
01:19:59,850 --> 01:20:02,460
That's all TSA.
Check them for shovels.

1885
01:20:02,520 --> 01:20:07,520
These dumb fucks you wouldn't remember.
We're going to do.

1886
01:20:07,740 --> 01:20:07,980
Oh,

1887
01:20:07,980 --> 01:20:11,880
did they tweet this or something?
So now they're looking at her twitter.

1888
01:20:12,030 --> 01:20:12,750
Yeah,
man,

1889
01:20:12,751 --> 01:20:14,850
they tweeted,
they're there 26 years old,

1890
01:20:14,851 --> 01:20:16,170
man.
They're they're kids.

1891
01:20:16,171 --> 01:20:17,670
They went to party,
man,

1892
01:20:17,850 --> 01:20:20,730
Department of Homeland Security Way to 
go.

1893
01:20:20,731 --> 01:20:25,560
You fuckheads these silly fucks.
They're supposed to be protecting us.

1894
01:20:25,680 --> 01:20:30,680
They pulled aside this cute punk rock.
Look in British couple that look like 

1895
01:20:30,680 --> 01:20:31,770
sweethearts.
You know?

1896
01:20:31,771 --> 01:20:35,130
I mean it's just let mean.
Look at this.

1897
01:20:35,340 --> 01:20:37,800
This is what.
This is what a dude wrote.

1898
01:20:37,860 --> 01:20:42,270
Free this week for a quick gossip prep 
before I go and destroy America.

1899
01:20:42,570 --> 01:20:44,490
That's the question.
Like a joke.

1900
01:20:44,491 --> 01:20:48,120
He's going here to have a fucking party.
Like he's going to destroy America.

1901
01:20:48,540 --> 01:20:50,760
Jesus cry.
They checked the shovels.

1902
01:20:50,790 --> 01:20:52,680
They sent them back home.
Man.

1903
01:20:52,980 --> 01:20:54,930
Not only that,
they arrested them,

1904
01:20:55,320 --> 01:21:00,320
lock them up with Mexican drug dealers 
that they also caught versus 12 fucking 

1905
01:21:00,600 --> 01:21:05,600
hours because they're immigrants.
They throw them in with the other 

1906
01:21:05,600 --> 01:21:05,600
immigrant criminals.

1907
01:21:05,600 --> 01:21:07,050
They throw them in with Mexican drug 
dealers that they busted,

1908
01:21:07,051 --> 01:21:12,051
so these guys were locked up with real 
hardcore criminals for 12 fucking hours 

1909
01:21:12,510 --> 01:21:15,030
and then they flew him back to Europe.
Fuck them,

1910
01:21:15,031 --> 01:21:16,590
soul.
Unbelievable.

1911
01:21:16,650 --> 01:21:18,930
It's unbelievable.
I mean really,

1912
01:21:18,931 --> 01:21:23,931
you can't have one rational person who 
looks at those two angles and it starts 

1913
01:21:23,931 --> 01:21:25,710
laughing.
His.

1914
01:21:25,711 --> 01:21:27,960
It was his what he writes also three 
weeks today.

1915
01:21:27,961 --> 01:21:32,961
We're totally in La,
pissing off people in Hollywood 

1916
01:21:32,961 --> 01:21:33,360
boulevard and digging up Marilyn Monroe.
Haha.

1917
01:21:33,660 --> 01:21:35,040
He's joking around,
man.

1918
01:21:35,041 --> 01:21:38,040
You really,
this is our tax dollars going to work.

1919
01:21:38,730 --> 01:21:43,730
This is 2012.
You know w we're not talking about 1950 

1920
01:21:43,730 --> 01:21:46,941
like we jumped into a time machine.
All of a sudden they have twitter in 

1921
01:21:46,941 --> 01:21:46,941
1950.
What?

1922
01:21:46,941 --> 01:21:50,300
They're going to destroy America now.
I think it was just to set an example 

1923
01:21:50,300 --> 01:21:52,290
like we're going to fuck anybody up the 
plays around.

1924
01:21:52,360 --> 01:21:52,680
I don't.

1925
01:21:52,760 --> 01:21:55,110
I think it's a bully and an abuse of 
power.

1926
01:21:55,111 --> 01:21:57,210
That's what it is.
I don't think in Sydney example at all.

1927
01:21:57,270 --> 01:22:02,270
I think they knew these were kids and 
they could fuck with them if they want 

1928
01:22:02,270 --> 01:22:02,270
it to.
I think they found someone to fuck with.

1929
01:22:02,270 --> 01:22:04,500
They found someone to fuck with and then
and then they did.

1930
01:22:04,530 --> 01:22:05,610
You know,
it's really,

1931
01:22:05,910 --> 01:22:07,860
really sad.
They came here and have fun.

1932
01:22:07,861 --> 01:22:11,910
You fuckheads Jesus Christ,
check them for fucking show.

1933
01:22:12,010 --> 01:22:12,710
They're,
they're,

1934
01:22:12,750 --> 01:22:17,750
they're checking twitter for joke joke,
things that you say job tweets about 

1935
01:22:17,821 --> 01:22:19,590
coming to America and getting fucked up.
Like,

1936
01:22:19,591 --> 01:22:21,150
do you really think that that's what a 
chair was?

1937
01:22:21,160 --> 01:22:26,160
Would white hm this week?
Free for a quick gossip before I go 

1938
01:22:26,160 --> 01:22:28,200
destroy America.
Like,

1939
01:22:28,201 --> 01:22:29,850
yeah,
that's what you have to worry about.

1940
01:22:29,880 --> 01:22:32,730
That's where our tax dollars are going.
What do you think about anonymous?

1941
01:22:33,480 --> 01:22:38,480
Listen man,
somebody needs to stand up for this 

1942
01:22:38,480 --> 01:22:40,540
fucking the wacky world that we're 
living in man and would anonymous 

1943
01:22:40,771 --> 01:22:41,970
represents is the internet.

1944
01:22:41,970 --> 01:22:46,970
Well,
the Internet represented most of the 

1945
01:22:46,970 --> 01:22:46,970
time is justice.
You know,

1946
01:22:46,970 --> 01:22:48,690
most of what they go after,
most of what they do is the right thing.

1947
01:22:49,050 --> 01:22:54,050
There's a lot of shit that goes on like 
this Dana white thing where they're 

1948
01:22:54,050 --> 01:22:54,050
hacking into his,
his,

1949
01:22:54,050 --> 01:22:58,281
uh,
social security and putting it all 

1950
01:22:58,281 --> 01:22:58,281
online.
That's Douchey Shit.

1951
01:22:58,281 --> 01:22:59,430
I heard it was fake.
I heard it wrong.

1952
01:22:59,460 --> 01:23:00,570
No,
it wasn't fake.

1953
01:23:00,600 --> 01:23:03,060
They got the information that you don't 
understand.

1954
01:23:03,061 --> 01:23:06,040
First of all,
it is dad's named Dana white as well and

1955
01:23:06,041 --> 01:23:11,041
they got a lot of.
Lot of the information they got was his 

1956
01:23:11,041 --> 01:23:12,961
dad's including liens and you know,
where his dad used to live and now some 

1957
01:23:12,961 --> 01:23:14,810
other guy got harassed because they,
you know,

1958
01:23:14,830 --> 01:23:19,830
because his information got put online.
So this guy like Dina had to go to this 

1959
01:23:19,830 --> 01:23:23,131
guy's house and apologize to him,
but the kid is apparently a 13 year old 

1960
01:23:23,131 --> 01:23:24,160
kid from Australia mean he doesn't 
represent anonymous.

1961
01:23:24,160 --> 01:23:29,160
He represents people on the Internet 
that don't like when people in the 

1962
01:23:29,160 --> 01:23:29,160
Internet challenged them.
You know,

1963
01:23:29,160 --> 01:23:29,980
like you say,
you can't hack me.

1964
01:23:29,981 --> 01:23:31,660
I dare you.
They're going to hack,

1965
01:23:31,661 --> 01:23:33,400
you know,
they're going to fucking hack you.

1966
01:23:33,550 --> 01:23:36,520
But that's not what.
What I like about anonymous,

1967
01:23:36,521 --> 01:23:40,690
what I like is that what it represents 
is people feel helpless.

1968
01:23:40,780 --> 01:23:45,190
They feel helpless to this gigantic,
oppressive power that is controlling the

1969
01:23:45,191 --> 01:23:47,110
world and running things in a way that 
they don't like.

1970
01:23:47,230 --> 01:23:50,230
And when these guys go after Department 
of Homeland Security,

1971
01:23:50,231 --> 01:23:52,630
all these different websites,
when these guys try to take things down,

1972
01:23:52,690 --> 01:23:55,030
what they're doing is they're there,
they're lashing out,

1973
01:23:55,031 --> 01:23:55,630
and they're saying,
hey,

1974
01:23:55,631 --> 01:23:57,700
we can touch you,
we can reach you,

1975
01:23:57,820 --> 01:24:02,820
we can find your information.
Like when they went after that guy that 

1976
01:24:02,820 --> 01:24:02,820
pepper sprayed,
all those fucking kids in the face,

1977
01:24:02,820 --> 01:24:07,590
those kids at uc Berkeley that were just
sitting on their knees and they got all 

1978
01:24:07,590 --> 01:24:07,590
that guy's information.

1979
01:24:07,590 --> 01:24:11,700
They put that shit online that I liked,
that I liked because that lets that guy 

1980
01:24:11,700 --> 01:24:11,700
know,
hey,

1981
01:24:11,700 --> 01:24:15,440
you can't do morally fucked up things 
because you're doing it under the,

1982
01:24:15,441 --> 01:24:15,790
the,
the,

1983
01:24:15,950 --> 01:24:17,680
the,
the blanket of your job,

1984
01:24:17,681 --> 01:24:22,681
the umbrella of protection that you 
think has offered you by being a police 

1985
01:24:22,681 --> 01:24:23,260
officer.
You're doing something reprehensible,

1986
01:24:23,261 --> 01:24:24,840
man.
You're spraying kids in the face with,

1987
01:24:24,930 --> 01:24:27,450
with chemicals,
you piece of shit for no reason.

1988
01:24:27,460 --> 01:24:29,010
Yeah.
And you got to feel that man got,

1989
01:24:29,050 --> 01:24:30,190
feel that.
And you know what man?

1990
01:24:30,191 --> 01:24:32,710
I saw a video where the people were 
trying to justify like,

1991
01:24:32,711 --> 01:24:33,910
listen,
this is what happened.

1992
01:24:33,911 --> 01:24:36,100
This is the full story.
What you saw was edited,

1993
01:24:36,290 --> 01:24:38,170
you know what they saw?
They saw the kids just sitting there for

1994
01:24:38,171 --> 01:24:39,220
a longer know.
Yeah.

1995
01:24:39,221 --> 01:24:40,570
They didn't move when they were told to 
move.

1996
01:24:40,571 --> 01:24:41,220
That doesn't mean you get

1997
01:24:41,230 --> 01:24:43,500
the spray in the fucking face.
I heard there were some shit in La.

1998
01:24:43,540 --> 01:24:48,540
Was it oakland re the other day and the 
cops were arrested like a crazy amount 

1999
01:24:48,881 --> 01:24:50,710
of people,
like 120 or 30 people,

2000
01:24:50,711 --> 01:24:53,590
but they were tear gassing and there was
like kids.

2001
01:24:53,591 --> 01:24:58,591
They're like one.
I don't think it's probably the best 

2002
01:24:58,591 --> 01:24:59,110
idea to be bringing your kids to things 
like this.

2003
01:24:59,870 --> 01:25:02,030
Assholes who are bringing their kids to 
these rallies because these things,

2004
01:25:02,660 --> 01:25:05,060
things can break out in violence at any 
moment.

2005
01:25:05,061 --> 01:25:07,600
Especially in Oakland.
Oakland is kind of crazy man.

2006
01:25:07,630 --> 01:25:09,740
Too Short.
Yeah.

2007
01:25:09,800 --> 01:25:11,210
Short dog.
Yeah.

2008
01:25:11,211 --> 01:25:13,390
Oakland is not to be fucked with.
Right.

2009
01:25:13,610 --> 01:25:17,840
Oakland's a tricky place.
You be in just for the hub for that shit

2010
01:25:17,870 --> 01:25:20,030
for the last 40 years.
They have no.

2011
01:25:20,580 --> 01:25:23,750
They play it every year.
That's where they go up there.

2012
01:25:23,751 --> 01:25:26,360
These people know how to react to it.
The sick and tired of it too.

2013
01:25:26,540 --> 01:25:29,000
You know,
and it takes two to tango,

2014
01:25:29,001 --> 01:25:32,540
but I love the idea of somebody checking
somebody.

2015
01:25:32,960 --> 01:25:34,970
I've always loved the idea.
Listen man,

2016
01:25:34,971 --> 01:25:37,190
I grew up in fucking death.
Wish you know what?

2017
01:25:37,191 --> 01:25:39,350
The cops can't be there for you all the 
fucking time.

2018
01:25:39,351 --> 01:25:44,351
I love the idea of somebody blast on the
motherfucker when you fucking do 

2019
01:25:44,351 --> 01:25:44,450
something wrong.

2020
01:25:45,200 --> 01:25:46,760
That's the best way.
I love it.

2021
01:25:46,820 --> 01:25:47,660
I'd love to.
Net.

2022
01:25:47,690 --> 01:25:49,970
I think at the Internet is eventually 
going to be the government.

2023
01:25:50,000 --> 01:25:55,000
That's what I think.
I think the way that we're going to 

2024
01:25:55,000 --> 01:25:56,621
govern things just through the Internet 
because instead of these oppressive 

2025
01:25:56,621 --> 01:25:58,991
groups that see what what really fucks 
us is that we don't really get a say in 

2026
01:25:59,001 --> 01:25:59,630
everything.
Well,

2027
01:25:59,631 --> 01:26:04,631
we get to do is we get a representative.
We get to choose a representative and 

2028
01:26:04,631 --> 01:26:08,471
they almost all get into office and 
immediately just do whatever the fuck 

2029
01:26:08,471 --> 01:26:10,070
incorporations that got them into power,
asked them to do.

2030
01:26:10,100 --> 01:26:15,100
That's what they do immediately.
They pass a bunch of bills like the 

2031
01:26:15,100 --> 01:26:16,280
national defense authorization act that 
everybody's going crazy about that.

2032
01:26:16,281 --> 01:26:21,281
Obama passed that.
He said he would veto all of that stuff 

2033
01:26:21,281 --> 01:26:22,640
is stopped.
If you put that for vote to America,

2034
01:26:22,700 --> 01:26:24,940
like at on the online,
what do you want?

2035
01:26:25,010 --> 01:26:26,810
What do you guys want to do?
No fucking way.

2036
01:26:26,811 --> 01:26:31,811
We would vote for that.
Were you going to arrest us and detain 

2037
01:26:31,811 --> 01:26:34,541
us with no warrant?
Because what people have to realize is 

2038
01:26:34,541 --> 01:26:35,540
the people that you're saying yes to 
today,

2039
01:26:35,690 --> 01:26:37,280
when you make a law and you say,
okay,

2040
01:26:37,281 --> 01:26:42,281
here's the law.
These people today may not be the same 

2041
01:26:42,281 --> 01:26:45,731
people.
You're saying yes to 20 years from now 

2042
01:26:45,731 --> 01:26:47,950
or even 10 years from now.
You can put laws into place that give 

2043
01:26:47,950 --> 01:26:48,350
evil,
corrupt people.

2044
01:26:48,351 --> 01:26:53,351
I'm not saying Obama Zebulon corrupt,
but I'm saying what he did is an evil 

2045
01:26:53,351 --> 01:26:54,020
and corrupt thing and he opened the door
for evil and corruption.

2046
01:26:54,021 --> 01:26:56,480
No doubt about it because if someone 
wants to do that,

2047
01:26:56,481 --> 01:26:59,360
some future Douchebag,
some Dick Cheney of the future.

2048
01:26:59,450 --> 01:27:02,900
If he gets into a position and in the 
national defense authorization act is in

2049
01:27:02,901 --> 01:27:03,890
place,
guess what?

2050
01:27:04,100 --> 01:27:06,980
A bunch of people going to go to fucking
jail that are just protesting.

2051
01:27:06,981 --> 01:27:11,981
The government have got a bunch of 
people going to go to jail for 

2052
01:27:11,981 --> 01:27:11,981
obstructing the.
The way the United States runs,

2053
01:27:11,981 --> 01:27:13,520
they're going to go to jail as enemies 
of the state.

2054
01:27:13,700 --> 01:27:15,170
That's real shit,
you know,

2055
01:27:15,171 --> 01:27:20,171
and that none of that would take place 
if the Internet was how we did our 

2056
01:27:20,171 --> 01:27:21,710
government and it sounds ridiculous,
but why shouldn't it be that way?

2057
01:27:21,880 --> 01:27:26,880
What what our government is supposed to 
represent is what the people want and 

2058
01:27:26,880 --> 01:27:29,270
what the people want can easily be found
out on the Internet.

2059
01:27:29,330 --> 01:27:34,330
It's easiest,
the easiest way to contact people and 

2060
01:27:34,330 --> 01:27:34,790
find out exactly what the fuck they want
regardless of nationality,

2061
01:27:34,791 --> 01:27:37,820
regardless of the state.
Where they live in is the internet.

2062
01:27:37,970 --> 01:27:39,650
That is how things are going to be 
ruled.

2063
01:27:39,740 --> 01:27:44,740
It used to be you had to go to a place,
you had to write down what you thought 

2064
01:27:44,740 --> 01:27:45,620
and put it in a fucking box and that's 
how they decided things.

2065
01:27:45,650 --> 01:27:46,970
You only because that was the only way 
to do it.

2066
01:27:46,971 --> 01:27:51,971
Any problem with that though is there's 
more opportunity for hacking and things 

2067
01:27:51,971 --> 01:27:51,971
like that.
Unfortunately.

2068
01:27:51,971 --> 01:27:53,240
Now,
right now there is.

2069
01:27:53,241 --> 01:27:54,200
Yeah.
But you know what,

2070
01:27:54,230 --> 01:27:55,730
that can be worked out too.
And you know what,

2071
01:27:55,731 --> 01:28:00,731
that's also in part,
a lot of that is in place because also 

2072
01:28:00,731 --> 01:28:01,220
because of corruption.
Look at the fucking.

2073
01:28:01,221 --> 01:28:03,410
The computerized voting machines.
Yeah.

2074
01:28:03,620 --> 01:28:08,620
If you don't know about this,
watch a documentary called hacking 

2075
01:28:08,620 --> 01:28:11,291
democracy.
It was something that was on Hbo Awhile 

2076
01:28:11,291 --> 01:28:11,291
back where they showed that these 
machines,

2077
01:28:11,291 --> 01:28:14,750
these diebold machines are designed to 
be altered.

2078
01:28:14,870 --> 01:28:19,870
They're designed so that a third party 
can come in and change the results and 

2079
01:28:19,870 --> 01:28:21,590
they were so fucked up.
They changed their name.

2080
01:28:21,591 --> 01:28:24,220
Diebold isn't even diebold anymore.
I'll find out what the fuck her name,

2081
01:28:24,221 --> 01:28:29,221
ours now so he can't be tricked,
but we live in a corrupt system and the 

2082
01:28:29,240 --> 01:28:34,240
what the Internet recognizes is that the
will of the people is not being 

2083
01:28:34,240 --> 01:28:38,951
represented what's being represented as 
the corporations and that's why 

2084
01:28:38,951 --> 01:28:39,890
everybody's hovering around all these 
fucking,

2085
01:28:40,070 --> 01:28:41,400
these,
these bill w,

2086
01:28:41,410 --> 01:28:46,410
w with this occupy thing is everyone's 
hovering and collecting and gathering 

2087
01:28:46,410 --> 01:28:48,320
together around all these sick areas.

2088
01:28:51,060 --> 01:28:52,470
Yes.
Yeah man.

2089
01:28:53,960 --> 01:28:58,960
We,
we had to short on a podcast last night 

2090
01:28:58,960 --> 01:28:58,960
and it was really amazed at the rapper,
the rapper,

2091
01:28:59,370 --> 01:29:01,890
he has like 19 albums out,
but of the cool things

2092
01:29:02,130 --> 01:29:06,120
hearing him talk about was a big.
He started off so early in the game that

2093
01:29:06,121 --> 01:29:11,121
people didn't even know what rap was.
And like he would just like open up his 

2094
01:29:11,121 --> 01:29:13,350
car doors to and they have like a beat 
playing and just rap,

2095
01:29:13,530 --> 01:29:16,590
you know,
like really loud with it.

2096
01:29:16,950 --> 01:29:18,780
And like one guy came up to him,
he's like,

2097
01:29:18,781 --> 01:29:19,620
man,
I like it,

2098
01:29:19,621 --> 01:29:22,020
I want to have that.
And then he just popped the cassette and

2099
01:29:22,021 --> 01:29:24,660
sold it to him for five bucks and then 
he started selling it to like,

2100
01:29:24,661 --> 01:29:26,580
all the drug dealers want heard about 
it.

2101
01:29:26,750 --> 01:29:27,970
And they're like,
that lived in Oakland,

2102
01:29:27,971 --> 01:29:32,971
like all the king pin guys.
And so they all wanted their own 

2103
01:29:32,971 --> 01:29:33,270
personalized wrap,
a cassette.

2104
01:29:33,420 --> 01:29:38,420
So then he was like making,
like having to write all these songs 

2105
01:29:38,420 --> 01:29:38,420
like nonstop just to keep up with all 
these drug.

2106
01:29:38,420 --> 01:29:40,080
How'd you the guy who knows him?

2107
01:29:40,170 --> 01:29:45,170
Uh,
we had Kevin Black on who's a sex tape 

2108
01:29:45,170 --> 01:29:45,170
guy who I,
you know,

2109
01:29:45,170 --> 01:29:49,880
he's the one that gets all the sex tape,
like the Paris Hilton sex tapes and 

2110
01:29:49,880 --> 01:29:52,551
stuff like that.
He's one of the only guys that has even 

2111
01:29:52,551 --> 01:29:53,250
seen the tupacs a sex tape.
Uh,

2112
01:29:53,251 --> 01:29:54,900
and uh,
he's friends with them.

2113
01:29:55,440 --> 01:29:57,650
He's friends with them with your short 
shorts.

2114
01:29:58,030 --> 01:30:03,030
So what's up with that?
Tupac sex to a white girls or African 

2115
01:30:04,390 --> 01:30:05,520
Americans?
I don't know.

2116
01:30:05,760 --> 01:30:06,860
I didn't.
I said,

2117
01:30:06,880 --> 01:30:08,220
why can't you release it?
Two Bucks.

2118
01:30:08,221 --> 01:30:08,910
Family?
Yeah,

2119
01:30:08,911 --> 01:30:10,320
I think it was a family thing.
I think.

2120
01:30:10,620 --> 01:30:11,150
I think the people

2121
01:30:11,190 --> 01:30:16,190
powers of be diebold changed his name to
premier election solutions incorporated 

2122
01:30:16,190 --> 01:30:18,510
or p e s I,
that's the new diebold.

2123
01:30:18,630 --> 01:30:23,630
Isn't it funny when companies do that,
they get caught doing something fucked 

2124
01:30:23,630 --> 01:30:26,391
up.
So they just changed the name and they 

2125
01:30:26,391 --> 01:30:26,391
just were evil,
but whatever.

2126
01:30:26,391 --> 01:30:28,350
You got to blackwater did the same 
thing.

2127
01:30:28,351 --> 01:30:29,440
They changed.
The man was.

2128
01:30:30,270 --> 01:30:31,520
I'll find out.
How far do you,

2129
01:30:31,590 --> 01:30:36,590
I think anonymous can go.
Do you think that could ever get shut 

2130
01:30:36,590 --> 01:30:36,590
down?
Can they know it's impossible?

2131
01:30:36,590 --> 01:30:40,410
The idea.
Because I think a lot of people get 

2132
01:30:40,410 --> 01:30:42,451
confused what in anonymous is the whole 
point why they can't get shut down 

2133
01:30:42,451 --> 01:30:42,451
because no one knows who the fuck they 
are.

2134
01:30:42,451 --> 01:30:45,340
There's tons of figure it out.
There's tons of people though,

2135
01:30:45,450 --> 01:30:46,840
will.
If they started arresting people,

2136
01:30:46,870 --> 01:30:51,870
it would be the most impossible thing 
that'd be like trying to have an army 

2137
01:30:51,870 --> 01:30:53,020
put together that attacks the whole 
world.

2138
01:30:53,070 --> 01:30:55,510
It would be like world war for real 
world.

2139
01:30:55,510 --> 01:30:56,990
This is crazy.
Blackwater.

2140
01:30:57,040 --> 01:30:59,020
So fucked up.
They change their name twice.

2141
01:30:59,410 --> 01:31:04,410
They changed.
They went from blackwater to x e and 

2142
01:31:04,410 --> 01:31:07,351
then they went from x e to academic with
a new logo.

2143
01:31:07,870 --> 01:31:10,600
They just changed their name.
They figured this.

2144
01:31:10,870 --> 01:31:12,760
No one's going to know.
Just keep changing it,

2145
01:31:13,000 --> 01:31:13,660
keep changing it.

2146
01:31:13,730 --> 01:31:15,170
Stopping anonymous would be like,
yeah,

2147
01:31:15,171 --> 01:31:20,171
they could spend all this money and time
and they'll find some 13 year old in 

2148
01:31:20,171 --> 01:31:20,171
Australia and then there's like a 
million.

2149
01:31:20,470 --> 01:31:21,450
Well,
the thing is that guy,

2150
01:31:21,451 --> 01:31:21,980
you know,
what,

2151
01:31:22,120 --> 01:31:23,740
what can they do to,
to,

2152
01:31:23,741 --> 01:31:28,741
um,
to prosecute people that the catch and 

2153
01:31:28,741 --> 01:31:30,750
how far they can go as far as shutting 
things down and controlling the 

2154
01:31:30,750 --> 01:31:33,541
infrastructure.
That's what people worried about what 

2155
01:31:33,541 --> 01:31:33,541
this Sofa with this sofa,
what they're worried about.

2156
01:31:33,541 --> 01:31:34,900
Again,
it's not the people you're saying yes to

2157
01:31:34,901 --> 01:31:36,340
today.
They might not be the same people you're

2158
01:31:36,341 --> 01:31:41,341
saying yesterday,
20 years from now and if you give the 

2159
01:31:41,341 --> 01:31:41,341
government the ability to just shut down
websites,

2160
01:31:41,341 --> 01:31:44,560
which by the way they already do.
They just did with Mega upload.

2161
01:31:44,660 --> 01:31:44,990
Yeah.
No,

2162
01:31:45,090 --> 01:31:47,280
they just closed down mega upload.
I'm so,

2163
01:31:47,400 --> 01:31:50,560
I'm so bummed about mega upload,
closing to a good website.

2164
01:31:50,590 --> 01:31:52,120
Okay.
But let's play devil's advocate.

2165
01:31:52,350 --> 01:31:57,350
They close mega upload because they said
that Mega upload has a bunch of 

2166
01:31:57,350 --> 01:31:58,510
different illegal files on it,
like where's,

2167
01:31:58,511 --> 01:32:03,511
and they have a of like movies and shit 
that screeners and mp3s if there's a 

2168
01:32:03,521 --> 01:32:08,521
website should.
And if you're offering that service to 

2169
01:32:08,521 --> 01:32:09,490
people where they can just upload shit 
and then you sell advertisement,

2170
01:32:09,491 --> 01:32:10,270
which they do,
right?

2171
01:32:10,271 --> 01:32:12,450
Isn't that how they work that shit?
And they sell subscriber.

2172
01:32:12,680 --> 01:32:17,680
I think if you have a free account,
there's limitations and they serve 

2173
01:32:17,680 --> 01:32:20,831
advertising.
I think they also have a paid account 

2174
01:32:20,831 --> 01:32:23,321
that I don't think has advertising,
but I think what it is is that it 

2175
01:32:23,321 --> 01:32:24,380
shouldn't be the company's fault.
It should be the user.

2176
01:32:24,381 --> 01:32:29,381
So yes,
they find dances with wolves on Mega 

2177
01:32:29,381 --> 01:32:33,370
Upload Server.
They find out who uploaded a day bust 

2178
01:32:33,370 --> 01:32:35,291
him.
I don't think it should be mega uploads 

2179
01:32:35,291 --> 01:32:36,690
fault for having a service where you can
legally you're supposed to share file,

2180
01:32:37,030 --> 01:32:38,210
but let's play devil's advocate.

2181
01:32:38,390 --> 01:32:43,390
Let's play devil's advocate.
If you do have a service where you're 

2182
01:32:43,390 --> 01:32:44,450
just sharing files and providing 
bandwidth,

2183
01:32:44,780 --> 01:32:49,780
you should be responsible for how much 
of that stuff is pirated because 

2184
01:32:49,780 --> 01:32:50,670
otherwise you're a distribution angle.
You're.

2185
01:32:50,840 --> 01:32:53,810
You're essentially a distribution 
highway for illegal shit.

2186
01:32:53,840 --> 01:32:57,950
I think maybe yes you should be,
but I think it should be more of like,

2187
01:32:58,490 --> 01:33:03,290
I don't know,
sharing of a personal information.

2188
01:33:03,291 --> 01:33:05,780
If you are doing something illegal 
should be allowed.

2189
01:33:05,900 --> 01:33:07,640
Maybe hearing a personal meaning like 
if,

2190
01:33:07,641 --> 01:33:08,140
if,
if,

2191
01:33:08,240 --> 01:33:10,520
if the FBI comes to mega app logos,
look,

2192
01:33:10,730 --> 01:33:14,150
we know that you have dances with wolves
on your server and they're like,

2193
01:33:14,151 --> 01:33:16,520
okay,
we need to know who this user rising.

2194
01:33:16,580 --> 01:33:18,470
I think then mega upload should be like,
okay,

2195
01:33:18,471 --> 01:33:20,990
here's the person's there for really 
using this should give you up.

2196
01:33:21,300 --> 01:33:26,300
If you're doing illegal stuff.
I don't think it should be mega uploads 

2197
01:33:26,300 --> 01:33:29,140
fault.
I don't think mega upload as a 

2198
01:33:29,140 --> 01:33:30,611
corporation should be shut down and for 
a business because you want to share 

2199
01:33:30,611 --> 01:33:30,611
dances with wolves.
Well you know

2200
01:33:30,611 --> 01:33:32,560
better the corporation be shut down in 
the user's going to jail.

2201
01:33:32,620 --> 01:33:37,620
That's the other devil's advocate is 
that these are just kids and they don't 

2202
01:33:37,620 --> 01:33:37,620
know any better and they think they're 
going to get away with it and they think

2203
01:33:37,620 --> 01:33:42,331
they're just helping people out by 
providing files that everybody wants to 

2204
01:33:42,331 --> 01:33:42,331
get ahold of.
You know,

2205
01:33:42,331 --> 01:33:42,910
look,
the pro,

2206
01:33:43,000 --> 01:33:48,000
the real problem is people have kind of 
grown up knowing that they can get shit 

2207
01:33:48,000 --> 01:33:48,490
for free now.
You know,

2208
01:33:48,530 --> 01:33:50,530
that's like sort of how they're.
That's how people feel.

2209
01:33:50,531 --> 01:33:52,150
They feel like shit is free,
you know,

2210
01:33:52,151 --> 01:33:53,260
hey,
I can get movies for free.

2211
01:33:53,261 --> 01:33:58,261
They joke around about it.
I've had people joke around on my own 

2212
01:33:58,261 --> 01:33:58,420
website about stealing my shit online.
They think it's cute,

2213
01:33:58,630 --> 01:33:59,260
you know?
Yeah,

2214
01:33:59,290 --> 01:34:00,820
I'll get the torrent,
lol,

2215
01:34:01,180 --> 01:34:01,930
you know,
and you're like,

2216
01:34:01,931 --> 01:34:02,690
wow,
you know,

2217
01:34:02,710 --> 01:34:04,490
like right in front of you knowing that 
you,

2218
01:34:05,530 --> 01:34:07,120
it's just,
it is what it is.

2219
01:34:07,420 --> 01:34:08,710
That's who you want to be.
That's,

2220
01:34:08,711 --> 01:34:13,711
that's all good.
But it's like they're so accustomed to 

2221
01:34:13,711 --> 01:34:14,860
stealing that they talk about it openly 
in front of the person's face,

2222
01:34:14,861 --> 01:34:17,350
on the website of the person who's 
selling the shit.

2223
01:34:17,450 --> 01:34:19,580
Yeah.
But that's just ignorance and stupidity.

2224
01:34:19,581 --> 01:34:21,040
But yeah.
So they,

2225
01:34:21,190 --> 01:34:23,000
they feel obligated,
not obligated.

2226
01:34:23,001 --> 01:34:25,400
They feel like they're entitled,
you know what it should be.

2227
01:34:25,460 --> 01:34:27,980
It shouldn't be throwing people in 
prison.

2228
01:34:28,040 --> 01:34:29,480
I don't think it should be like,
yeah,

2229
01:34:29,481 --> 01:34:31,610
you,
you were sharing dances with wolves with

2230
01:34:31,611 --> 01:34:36,611
seven other people and I don't think 
that person should go to prison for 20 

2231
01:34:36,611 --> 01:34:39,761
years.
I think you should have some kind of 

2232
01:34:39,761 --> 01:34:39,761
thing like maybe.
Right.

2233
01:34:39,761 --> 01:34:39,761
You're not allowed to have the Internet 
for a year.

2234
01:34:39,920 --> 01:34:42,150
You know,
Kevin Mitnick

2235
01:34:42,320 --> 01:34:43,580
punishment,
that's what they did to him,

2236
01:34:43,581 --> 01:34:44,630
but the real issue,
Brian,

2237
01:34:44,631 --> 01:34:47,230
is that,
that actually has crushed industries.

2238
01:34:47,490 --> 01:34:50,690
You look at the music industry,
the music industry is fucked.

2239
01:34:50,930 --> 01:34:52,040
You know what,
you know,

2240
01:34:52,730 --> 01:34:57,730
one of the things that Dana White didn't
wait actually wants to come on the 

2241
01:34:57,730 --> 01:34:57,730
podcast and he wants to talk about.
So,

2242
01:34:57,730 --> 01:35:01,860
but um,
let's talk about all the shit that 

2243
01:35:01,860 --> 01:35:01,860
happened,
you know,

2244
01:35:01,860 --> 01:35:01,860
I talked about interviewing on my own.
Let me interview for UFC.

2245
01:35:01,860 --> 01:35:01,990
It got DOTCOM.
He goes,

2246
01:35:01,991 --> 01:35:02,690
you know what?
It'd be better.

2247
01:35:02,691 --> 01:35:03,950
Let's do your podcast.
I said,

2248
01:35:03,951 --> 01:35:04,850
all right,
we'll do it.

2249
01:35:04,851 --> 01:35:06,140
So we're going to figure out when to do 
it.

2250
01:35:06,680 --> 01:35:09,620
And so he's,
he's totally into free speech.

2251
01:35:09,621 --> 01:35:11,900
You just don't want him any ripping off 
his fucking product.

2252
01:35:12,050 --> 01:35:12,680
And then,
you know,

2253
01:35:12,710 --> 01:35:13,110
the,
the,

2254
01:35:13,140 --> 01:35:18,140
the amount of piracy is so widespread 
that people were actually pirating 

2255
01:35:18,140 --> 01:35:22,331
streams and then showing them in bars 
and charging people to go to those bars 

2256
01:35:22,331 --> 01:35:23,000
to watch pirated streams.

2257
01:35:23,030 --> 01:35:25,910
There's definitely cases like that day,
obviously that's,

2258
01:35:26,390 --> 01:35:27,590
that should be attacked.
Well,

2259
01:35:27,591 --> 01:35:30,410
there's also people that put streams up 
and then they sell advertising.

2260
01:35:30,411 --> 01:35:33,320
They have Google ads and they actually,
you know,

2261
01:35:33,730 --> 01:35:36,710
it's not just like a free thing,
they're making money off of the stream.

2262
01:35:36,760 --> 01:35:37,680
Right.
You know,

2263
01:35:37,690 --> 01:35:38,540
that's,
that's a big,

2264
01:35:38,541 --> 01:35:41,300
there's a big difference between that.
That person is putting that up there and

2265
01:35:41,301 --> 01:35:46,301
making money for people.
Thousands of people that are coming to 

2266
01:35:46,301 --> 01:35:47,270
the site and the person who's 14 years 
old can't afford the UFC,

2267
01:35:47,271 --> 01:35:48,680
who's downloading it for free.
Yeah.

2268
01:35:48,920 --> 01:35:51,650
So that's what the real issue is.
What they're really.

2269
01:35:51,740 --> 01:35:56,740
What they're really concerned about is 
the people that are actually profiting 

2270
01:35:56,740 --> 01:35:57,230
off pirating their shit,
you know?

2271
01:35:57,231 --> 01:35:59,240
And so it's,
it's a tricky thing.

2272
01:35:59,250 --> 01:36:04,250
Like my take on it has always been that 
the Internet without a doubt has 

2273
01:36:04,250 --> 01:36:06,830
promoted me and helped me more than 
anything.

2274
01:36:06,830 --> 01:36:11,830
So the more people that have stolen my 
stuff means the more people who have 

2275
01:36:11,830 --> 01:36:12,200
enjoyed my stuff,
which means the more people will come to

2276
01:36:12,201 --> 01:36:13,910
see me,
the more people will come.

2277
01:36:13,911 --> 01:36:15,930
Like this Chicago show or anything else,
you know,

2278
01:36:15,950 --> 01:36:19,100
I mean that's the purpose.
We could easily charge for this podcast.

2279
01:36:19,101 --> 01:36:20,480
I mean,
some of you probably willing to pay,

2280
01:36:20,840 --> 01:36:25,840
but we know a lot of people that make a 
lot of money every month because of 

2281
01:36:25,840 --> 01:36:25,840
their podcasts,
you know,

2282
01:36:25,840 --> 01:36:29,771
they have subscriptions where they have 
like one extra podcast they do every 

2283
01:36:29,771 --> 01:36:33,311
month,
but I think the best way to do it is to 

2284
01:36:33,311 --> 01:36:33,680
give as much people as much shit for 
free as possible.

2285
01:36:33,740 --> 01:36:35,690
But that's also because we're live 
performers,

2286
01:36:35,990 --> 01:36:37,400
you know,
that's how we see it.

2287
01:36:37,401 --> 01:36:37,780
You know,
we're,

2288
01:36:37,790 --> 01:36:40,140
we're live performances,
like the key to for us as you know,

2289
01:36:40,190 --> 01:36:41,270
come out and see us,
man,

2290
01:36:41,310 --> 01:36:46,310
devil's advocate on the devil's advocate
of the UFC UFC thing is that honestly 

2291
01:36:48,301 --> 01:36:53,240
there's 60 bucks and nowadays there's 
like two or three UFC.

2292
01:36:53,250 --> 01:36:55,770
He's a month sometimes.
Even to me,

2293
01:36:55,830 --> 01:37:00,060
I liked the UFC to a bit like I,
I know if I was a hardcore UFC guy,

2294
01:37:00,070 --> 01:37:01,010
I'd order everything.

2295
01:37:01,060 --> 01:37:02,710
It's a lot of money.
I know that's a lot on.

2296
01:37:02,820 --> 01:37:03,240
It's like,
man,

2297
01:37:03,270 --> 01:37:03,950
I don't argue with

2298
01:37:03,980 --> 01:37:06,770
that's $180.
I think sometimes it's every week.

2299
01:37:06,830 --> 01:37:09,890
I think that if UFC was smart and a lot 
of these people were smart,

2300
01:37:09,891 --> 01:37:12,350
they would do a subscription based thing
like you're paying 20 bucks a month,

2301
01:37:12,351 --> 01:37:13,310
you get everything use,

2302
01:37:13,500 --> 01:37:18,500
you know,
what else would be kind of dope if they 

2303
01:37:18,500 --> 01:37:19,770
had it laid the way Hbo pay per view has
it where you are if you like,

2304
01:37:19,771 --> 01:37:24,771
don't want to watch Oscar de la Hoya 
fight or floyd mayweather fight and hbo 

2305
01:37:24,771 --> 01:37:25,920
pay per view next week.
The next Friday.

2306
01:37:25,921 --> 01:37:28,210
It's for free on HBO.
Yeah,

2307
01:37:28,211 --> 01:37:29,220
that's good.
That would be pretty,

2308
01:37:29,310 --> 01:37:30,510
pretty dope.
I agree with,

2309
01:37:30,511 --> 01:37:32,520
you know,
if like they had like huge cards,

2310
01:37:32,521 --> 01:37:37,521
like say Alistair Overeem,
fight junior dos Santos and it's a big 

2311
01:37:37,521 --> 01:37:40,491
paper of card.
How I'll throw it on Fox the next 

2312
01:37:40,491 --> 01:37:40,491
Friday,
you know,

2313
01:37:40,491 --> 01:37:43,961
you could watch a replay and that way 
also they'll know that they're going to 

2314
01:37:43,961 --> 01:37:44,160
put on some bad ass fight.
So if it's some,

2315
01:37:44,370 --> 01:37:46,520
you know,
if it's one of those fights,

2316
01:37:46,620 --> 01:37:51,620
it's not the most entertaining fight.
I mean I live fights are much better 

2317
01:37:51,620 --> 01:37:52,890
shore for Fox.
Maybe it's not fox,

2318
01:37:52,891 --> 01:37:55,920
maybe it's an fx thing,
showed on fx the week after.

2319
01:37:56,130 --> 01:38:01,130
Not a bad idea,
but the thing about MMA is a lot of 

2320
01:38:01,130 --> 01:38:03,381
people by the replays,
they'll buy it again and they'll bite 

2321
01:38:03,381 --> 01:38:03,381
level.
They're here about how good it is.

2322
01:38:03,381 --> 01:38:07,651
And they'll buy the replay.
That probably kills a venue thing about 

2323
01:38:07,651 --> 01:38:07,760
two weeks.
WHATSAPP,

2324
01:38:07,890 --> 01:38:12,890
that kills it about two weeks.
So you've got to get all the money you 

2325
01:38:12,890 --> 01:38:12,890
can,
you know,

2326
01:38:12,890 --> 01:38:14,490
what he was doing over the years is 
after a fight,

2327
01:38:14,850 --> 01:38:16,910
um,
they would put it up to use a leash,

2328
01:38:16,990 --> 01:38:21,990
maybe six months.
Now they fucking put it up at UFC at 

2329
01:38:21,990 --> 01:38:21,990
least a month later.
Yeah.

2330
01:38:21,990 --> 01:38:23,370
That's good.
That's really fucking good.

2331
01:38:23,600 --> 01:38:24,190
Good.
Uh,

2332
01:38:24,360 --> 01:38:25,040
the fight,
uh,

2333
01:38:25,140 --> 01:38:30,140
not this week,
but let's say a Vic Diaz against Nate 

2334
01:38:30,140 --> 01:38:31,170
Diaz against the serone,
you know,

2335
01:38:31,171 --> 01:38:32,250
I want to see that,
you know,

2336
01:38:32,360 --> 01:38:34,500
beyond this month.
That was new years.

2337
01:38:34,501 --> 01:38:37,830
So it'll be on first week of February.
I miss all those spike guys.

2338
01:38:38,190 --> 01:38:39,870
Those guys were awesome.
Well,

2339
01:38:39,871 --> 01:38:40,710
you know,
like I said,

2340
01:38:40,711 --> 01:38:42,210
right now is the best time.
Listen,

2341
01:38:42,510 --> 01:38:45,010
right now is the best time ever for 
another band.

2342
01:38:45,030 --> 01:38:46,080
Susie's.
Yeah,

2343
01:38:46,210 --> 01:38:46,950
like me.
Look,

2344
01:38:46,951 --> 01:38:49,800
I go home right now.
I tape UFC tonight.

2345
01:38:50,640 --> 01:38:55,350
I tape fucking pride with Kendra Perez 
from nine to 10,

2346
01:38:55,500 --> 01:38:58,680
which is better than the,
the pride they were doing before.

2347
01:38:58,860 --> 01:39:01,500
They eliminated a lot of shit that you 
didn't need to see.

2348
01:39:01,990 --> 01:39:04,020
And now they even cut it down.
They got cro,

2349
01:39:04,021 --> 01:39:05,470
cop against fucking,
uh,

2350
01:39:05,910 --> 01:39:10,910
the Russian.
I've been watching this tension that my 

2351
01:39:10,910 --> 01:39:10,910
Alexander.

2352
01:39:11,980 --> 01:39:13,830
Oh,
that my head is almost exploded.

2353
01:39:14,040 --> 01:39:15,300
Not to mention,
you know,

2354
01:39:15,301 --> 01:39:17,790
you've got the round table with Jay.
You got,

2355
01:39:17,880 --> 01:39:19,440
you know,
late night fucking,

2356
01:39:19,500 --> 01:39:20,380
uh,
uh,

2357
01:39:20,470 --> 01:39:24,000
were UFC reloaded,
which those are fucking lightning quick.

2358
01:39:24,480 --> 01:39:25,290
Okay.
So let's see.

2359
01:39:25,291 --> 01:39:28,410
The Ben Henderson fight against Frankie 
Edgar is the 25th.

2360
01:39:28,660 --> 01:39:32,340
It'll beyond by the last week of March.
Plus you got fucking,

2361
01:39:32,400 --> 01:39:34,290
they got the contract,
not spiteful together.

2362
01:39:34,291 --> 01:39:37,500
Two thousand 12.
So on Wednesdays you could watch fucking

2363
01:39:37,501 --> 01:39:41,640
old fights all fucking day and you know,
spike anything that fucking fx does.

2364
01:39:41,641 --> 01:39:44,640
Now they counter it with like this week 
they had all of her shots,

2365
01:39:44,641 --> 01:39:45,630
fights.
Believe it or not,

2366
01:39:45,640 --> 01:39:47,490
a couple of people fucking watch that 
shit.

2367
01:39:47,491 --> 01:39:49,200
I think it's good.
This is good.

2368
01:39:49,201 --> 01:39:51,650
I'm happy.
I don't miss anything.

2369
01:39:51,840 --> 01:39:54,990
My dvr is UFC.
We loaded UFC tonight.

2370
01:39:55,500 --> 01:39:58,440
Tonight is to count down at 6:00.
Fucking Pacific,

2371
01:39:58,441 --> 01:39:59,460
9:00
eastern.

2372
01:39:59,760 --> 01:40:04,760
They've given you a ton of fucking May.
You got to fucking steal something for 

2373
01:40:04,760 --> 01:40:05,940
what the fuck you going to feel 
something for that.

2374
01:40:05,941 --> 01:40:07,410
What else can they fucking give you

2375
01:40:07,670 --> 01:40:10,670
on the music tip?
What I've found for me personally,

2376
01:40:10,671 --> 01:40:14,780
like with itunes and Torrance is not 
good as people.

2377
01:40:14,840 --> 01:40:18,140
I mean the whole industry,
the record industry just fell apart.

2378
01:40:18,410 --> 01:40:21,290
But what's happening and I know they got
to feel this,

2379
01:40:21,650 --> 01:40:26,390
but I'm buying all my old shit on 
itunes.

2380
01:40:26,540 --> 01:40:31,540
I don't want to pull out the CD's and 
load them into my computer and then 

2381
01:40:31,540 --> 01:40:35,740
upload them to my ipod.
I just want to get on my phone and I 

2382
01:40:35,740 --> 01:40:36,800
think of a song that I already have from
my old record collection.

2383
01:40:36,801 --> 01:40:39,710
I'm bree buying all my old shit.
What about that?

2384
01:40:39,770 --> 01:40:40,420
You know,
I know,

2385
01:40:40,680 --> 01:40:42,290
you know,
we're not buying as many cds,

2386
01:40:42,410 --> 01:40:47,410
but I think people are buying all the 
old shit stairway to heaven about 30 

2387
01:40:47,410 --> 01:40:47,870
times in my life.
Yeah,

2388
01:40:47,871 --> 01:40:50,120
there's definitely a few cds of 10 
times.

2389
01:40:51,260 --> 01:40:56,260
I don't want to.
I know you can get it for free 

2390
01:40:56,260 --> 01:40:56,260
somewhere.
I know people

2391
01:40:56,260 --> 01:40:56,260
just like,
let me go to itunes.

2392
01:40:56,260 --> 01:40:57,730
Ninety nine cents,
make it so you have money,

2393
01:40:58,090 --> 01:41:00,280
you know,
for really poor college kids.

2394
01:41:00,281 --> 01:41:02,980
They do exactly that,
but they go to a website or they go to a

2395
01:41:02,981 --> 01:41:06,040
torrent bit.
Does or even where sites anymore.

2396
01:41:06,160 --> 01:41:11,160
Not really leaving an itunes yet.
They finally fucking.

2397
01:41:11,600 --> 01:41:16,600
Who are they?
There's a couple of bands that still to 

2398
01:41:16,600 --> 01:41:16,990
this day they will be.
It's just got on it recently.

2399
01:41:17,830 --> 01:41:18,940
Pink Floyd.
A couple of bands.

2400
01:41:18,941 --> 01:41:20,320
Well,
why I don't understand.

2401
01:41:20,350 --> 01:41:21,550
I don't know.
Weird.

2402
01:41:22,040 --> 01:41:26,630
You know those motherfuckers I set 1970,
so I just like,

2403
01:41:26,890 --> 01:41:31,090
like red band said when it's something 
that you can download illegally,

2404
01:41:31,091 --> 01:41:36,091
like music or movies or anything,
it just sell it for as cheap as possible

2405
01:41:37,541 --> 01:41:41,080
so that you got to sell it so that it's 
not worth going.

2406
01:41:41,081 --> 01:41:45,000
And what he did with Lucy gets.
So this whole special for five bucks,

2407
01:41:45,070 --> 01:41:46,090
you'll get that money.

2408
01:41:46,600 --> 01:41:50,680
I will never spend $180 on a UFC,
you know,

2409
01:41:50,681 --> 01:41:53,650
a month.
But if I were to the option for 20 bucks

2410
01:41:53,651 --> 01:41:54,460
a month,
I got everything.

2411
01:41:54,490 --> 01:41:56,870
I would do it even if I never watched a 
books militia.

2412
01:41:57,350 --> 01:42:01,160
Louis C dot K dot.
Well yeah,

2413
01:42:01,180 --> 01:42:03,310
but you're just used to.
People get a lot more people.

2414
01:42:03,311 --> 01:42:06,810
You're just so used to our pricing 
structure that was created by boxing and

2415
01:42:06,830 --> 01:42:09,400
in like the eighties because the paper 
view is so amazing.

2416
01:42:09,520 --> 01:42:09,610
Right?

2417
01:42:10,140 --> 01:42:13,170
What if you had any idea how much it 
costs to put on a production,

2418
01:42:13,171 --> 01:42:15,300
you would understand why you didn't have
to charge so much.

2419
01:42:15,540 --> 01:42:18,010
It's ridiculous,
but if you have 20 bucks no more.

2420
01:42:18,330 --> 01:42:21,130
No you wouldn't.
You wouldn't sell enough to compensate?

2421
01:42:21,210 --> 01:42:21,930
I don't think so.
Well,

2422
01:42:21,931 --> 01:42:26,931
Louis CK did.
Joe Rogan was with the most brilliant 

2423
01:42:26,931 --> 01:42:26,931
thing and can be done in 20 years.
Yeah,

2424
01:42:26,931 --> 01:42:29,010
he.
He's like anonymous.

2425
01:42:29,011 --> 01:42:30,490
He checked.
Everybody checked.

2426
01:42:30,510 --> 01:42:33,540
The whole central got checked.
I told got checked.

2427
01:42:33,541 --> 01:42:38,541
By the way,
I'm doing the same thing I'm working on 

2428
01:42:38,541 --> 01:42:40,320
right now.
I'm thinking about doing an Atlanta in 

2429
01:42:40,320 --> 01:42:43,071
April.
That's what it gave it away for free or 

2430
01:42:43,071 --> 01:42:43,920
something for a DVD.
But here's the beauty of it,

2431
01:42:43,921 --> 01:42:45,180
man.
Dope.

2432
01:42:45,210 --> 01:42:50,210
Everybody benefited on this,
but nobody benefited as much as the 

2433
01:42:50,210 --> 01:42:50,430
fans.
Louis did it for his fame.

2434
01:42:50,820 --> 01:42:52,140
Five bucks.
I found load.

2435
01:42:52,141 --> 01:42:55,650
Is that what it was for the actual hard 
copy download?

2436
01:42:55,980 --> 01:42:56,700
Well,
that's all you need.

2437
01:42:56,810 --> 01:42:58,020
That's all you leave.
That's it.

2438
01:42:58,070 --> 01:42:58,910
I guess.
I think it can download,

2439
01:42:58,911 --> 01:43:03,911
downloaded more than once.
Take it so cheap that they can't really 

2440
01:43:03,911 --> 01:43:03,911
make out.
It was the.

2441
01:43:04,290 --> 01:43:05,300
It was a million dollars.

2442
01:43:06,430 --> 01:43:08,500
The idea of the UFC.
Twenty bucks a month then.

2443
01:43:08,501 --> 01:43:08,790
Yeah.
Yeah,

2444
01:43:08,960 --> 01:43:10,440
yeah.
I don't think they would do it that way.

2445
01:43:10,590 --> 01:43:12,960
It's not ready for $20 a month or two 
years.

2446
01:43:12,961 --> 01:43:16,200
Three years away.
The subscription monthly subscription is

2447
01:43:16,201 --> 01:43:17,330
not a bad idea,
you know,

2448
01:43:17,370 --> 01:43:18,980
that would be pretty cool.
Sure.

2449
01:43:19,290 --> 01:43:21,180
You get everything.
You get the webpage you get there.

2450
01:43:21,480 --> 01:43:22,920
What is the club?
What's in fight club?

2451
01:43:22,921 --> 01:43:27,921
Fight Club.
I don't have like a thing that they do 

2452
01:43:27,921 --> 01:43:30,381
that with the NFL.
They have nfl packages that you get on 

2453
01:43:30,381 --> 01:43:30,510
direct TV,
all the Games but games,

2454
01:43:31,960 --> 01:43:33,750
they make a ton of fucking money.
Well you know,

2455
01:43:33,751 --> 01:43:38,751
we came,
they came real close to having a UFC 

2456
01:43:38,751 --> 01:43:40,491
channel,
you know they were going to have a UFC 

2457
01:43:40,491 --> 01:43:42,321
fucking channel at one point in time.
They were thinking about buying like a 

2458
01:43:42,321 --> 01:43:44,991
spike tv or something along those lines 
and start their own channel and that 

2459
01:43:44,991 --> 01:43:45,330
might very well be the future,
you know,

2460
01:43:45,331 --> 01:43:48,600
who knows after they're done with the 
Fox deal or they might do it with Fox or

2461
01:43:48,601 --> 01:43:51,210
you know,
who knows how all this comes together.

2462
01:43:51,550 --> 01:43:52,040
You know the

2463
01:43:52,040 --> 01:43:54,200
Fox things are strange man.
It's a,

2464
01:43:54,201 --> 01:43:56,180
it's the same but it's not the same.
It's the same.

2465
01:43:56,181 --> 01:43:58,820
But there's like all this extra talking,
you know,

2466
01:43:58,821 --> 01:44:01,850
I see all this sitting around the desk 
and all this shit and I watched it.

2467
01:44:01,860 --> 01:44:03,110
I was like,
I feel like,

2468
01:44:03,230 --> 01:44:04,760
you know,
the way we did it spike style,

2469
01:44:04,761 --> 01:44:06,650
they could slide in another fight.
You know,

2470
01:44:06,651 --> 01:44:08,960
there's some bad ass fights and that 
undercard man,

2471
01:44:09,140 --> 01:44:10,070
you know,
they could have in

2472
01:44:10,250 --> 01:44:13,570
Charles wants to cut out.
Yeah,

2473
01:44:13,960 --> 01:44:15,720
totally shit that we could have slid in 
there,

2474
01:44:16,010 --> 01:44:18,080
could have slid something in there 
instead of everybody talking.

2475
01:44:18,081 --> 01:44:20,030
I would rather not talk other than,
you know what I mean?

2476
01:44:20,031 --> 01:44:20,990
Look,
everybody knows what it is.

2477
01:44:20,991 --> 01:44:21,370
I'll,
I'll,

2478
01:44:21,371 --> 01:44:22,970
I'll hype it up in the beginning and 
everything like that.

2479
01:44:22,971 --> 01:44:24,590
But I want to get that fucking walking 
going.

2480
01:44:24,591 --> 01:44:25,760
Let's go baby.
Let's go.

2481
01:44:25,890 --> 01:44:26,440
You know,
I,

2482
01:44:26,441 --> 01:44:31,441
I can hype everything up plenty.
While these dudes are walking into the 

2483
01:44:31,441 --> 01:44:34,391
octagon,
I can answer any questions or propose 

2484
01:44:34,391 --> 01:44:36,541
any possible scenarios.
I just want the fucking fight to take 

2485
01:44:36,541 --> 01:44:36,541
place.
I say the less talking the better.

2486
01:44:36,541 --> 01:44:38,810
But I think they're used to like desks 
and shit.

2487
01:44:39,280 --> 01:44:41,330
Fox used to like dudes with paper in 
front of him.

2488
01:44:41,830 --> 01:44:46,830
They love the whole fucking crazy 
listening to a superbowl music with UFC 

2489
01:44:51,220 --> 01:44:52,940
mad.
That's not super well music.

2490
01:44:52,970 --> 01:44:55,960
That's Fox sports music.
Well that's the music you hear.

2491
01:44:56,990 --> 01:44:58,580
They get all crazy.
By the way,

2492
01:44:58,581 --> 01:45:00,590
God is your specialist.
$5.

2493
01:45:00,950 --> 01:45:05,000
We should mention that.
The first card gets me in the priest,

2494
01:45:05,001 --> 01:45:05,600
right?
Yes.

2495
01:45:05,601 --> 01:45:09,560
It's either you or the priest.
The first cargo payloads.

2496
01:45:09,561 --> 01:45:12,950
Payloads.
But hopefully that I like to UFC Brian.

2497
01:45:12,951 --> 01:45:15,650
I like what they do as a fan.
I like what they do.

2498
01:45:15,651 --> 01:45:17,270
I really like everything about it.
You know,

2499
01:45:17,271 --> 01:45:20,630
when I watched the short time,
I got a load of fucking volume.

2500
01:45:20,660 --> 01:45:22,310
Okay.
And when I watch Fox,

2501
01:45:22,311 --> 01:45:27,311
I don't mind Kenny Florian there,
the other guys like a miniature fucking 

2502
01:45:27,311 --> 01:45:28,400
Joe Rogan with his little haircut and 
his little fucking suit.

2503
01:45:28,700 --> 01:45:30,390
He looks like Joe Rogan.
Who's radio?

2504
01:45:30,391 --> 01:45:32,810
Yeah,
he was like Joe Rogan on news radio.

2505
01:45:32,811 --> 01:45:34,520
He needs a pointy sideburns.

2506
01:45:34,520 --> 01:45:35,390
Right.
So.

2507
01:45:35,590 --> 01:45:38,450
Well it's so weird that.
What the fuck was I talking about?

2508
01:45:38,510 --> 01:45:39,140
Anyway?
Who knows?

2509
01:45:39,480 --> 01:45:43,010
They got the first fight was a fucking 
nightmare.

2510
01:45:43,640 --> 01:45:48,640
We went to it.
You go kind enough to give myself any 

2511
01:45:48,640 --> 01:45:48,640
tickets.
First off,

2512
01:45:48,640 --> 01:45:50,570
the fight started at six.
Nothing happened till 6:40.

2513
01:45:50,780 --> 01:45:51,920
That's too much.
Joe Rogan.

2514
01:45:51,921 --> 01:45:53,880
I can't sit there for 40 minutes just 
talking.

2515
01:45:54,850 --> 01:45:59,850
Everybody else was taught at least now 
they giving you three minutes.

2516
01:46:00,021 --> 01:46:02,030
We sat there.
No national anthem though.

2517
01:46:02,031 --> 01:46:07,031
Peanut.
Nobody get daddy and give you a fucking 

2518
01:46:07,031 --> 01:46:07,031
drink.
We didn't know what to do.

2519
01:46:07,031 --> 01:46:10,690
You can't get up you campaign.
We don't know what the fucking next 

2520
01:46:10,690 --> 01:46:10,690
file.
Yeah,

2521
01:46:10,690 --> 01:46:12,920
they didn't treat it the way we always 
try to live have been tremendous.

2522
01:46:12,921 --> 01:46:14,960
This last one was beautiful.
I watched.

2523
01:46:14,961 --> 01:46:18,410
I taped the Fox thing that the main 
fight,

2524
01:46:18,560 --> 01:46:20,720
except for the bisping Simon fight,
which is pretty exciting.

2525
01:46:20,721 --> 01:46:24,470
The main fight weren't as exciting as 
the fights and the undercard.

2526
01:46:24,650 --> 01:46:25,040
You know

2527
01:46:25,460 --> 01:46:26,870
bro,
it's the curse of Fox.

2528
01:46:28,740 --> 01:46:30,390
The cursor.
No,

2529
01:46:31,140 --> 01:46:33,770
it'll be fine.
Look at fx fight that Melvin Gallard.

2530
01:46:33,771 --> 01:46:38,771
Jim Miller.
Jim Miller is a fucking animal dude.

2531
01:46:39,260 --> 01:46:41,790
Jim Miller's an animal.
God Damn that dude.

2532
01:46:41,840 --> 01:46:43,110
Melvin was lightening.
Bob.

2533
01:46:43,140 --> 01:46:47,410
He was shot.
She can take it to him.

2534
01:46:47,411 --> 01:46:49,140
Man.
He could take it in the way he took that

2535
01:46:49,141 --> 01:46:51,900
back,
dove on that back mountain.

2536
01:46:51,901 --> 01:46:56,901
Man.
I've always been scary from low side of 

2537
01:46:56,901 --> 01:46:56,901
those guys from that side of the woods 
in Jersey.

2538
01:46:57,060 --> 01:46:59,900
They come up to creedence clearwater and
shit like that.

2539
01:47:02,040 --> 01:47:04,260
Close to Pennsylvania.
Those motherfuckers will kill you.

2540
01:47:04,750 --> 01:47:05,290
That,
that,

2541
01:47:05,310 --> 01:47:07,640
that other side of New Jersey.
That's what I love.

2542
01:47:08,300 --> 01:47:12,240
See you guys will be living in Georgia.
People over there.

2543
01:47:12,241 --> 01:47:13,390
Yeah.
That's fucking different.

2544
01:47:14,500 --> 01:47:15,660
Wherever the fuck he's from.
Yeah.

2545
01:47:15,661 --> 01:47:16,980
That's.
That's a different angle.

2546
01:47:17,060 --> 01:47:18,240
Yeah.
Jim Miller is a hunter.

2547
01:47:18,450 --> 01:47:23,450
You know,
you don't think of that when you think 

2548
01:47:23,450 --> 01:47:23,580
of Jersey like outdoors.
You got the Jersey shore,

2549
01:47:23,581 --> 01:47:25,350
you've got those crazy fucking mountain 
men.

2550
01:47:25,630 --> 01:47:27,240
Had you got to northern New Jersey.
That's it.

2551
01:47:27,241 --> 01:47:28,630
Do you want me to build?
Yeah,

2552
01:47:28,650 --> 01:47:33,650
totally different.
Three different fucking confidence in 

2553
01:47:33,650 --> 01:47:33,650
what the Jersey shore.
Just it just passing off.

2554
01:47:33,650 --> 01:47:33,900
Ed just.

2555
01:47:35,930 --> 01:47:39,320
I started watching Jersey shore and I 
thought,

2556
01:47:39,340 --> 01:47:44,240
can't love him and Dina.
Oh my God.

2557
01:47:44,270 --> 01:47:45,410
You love it.
For Real.

2558
01:47:46,430 --> 01:47:50,720
I'm addicted to it because they're so 
retarded.

2559
01:47:51,770 --> 01:47:53,510
I love watching.
I mean,

2560
01:47:53,690 --> 01:47:58,490
snuggie and Dina are female versions of 
Beavis and butthead and they're,

2561
01:47:59,020 --> 01:48:00,830
they're like,
for real,

2562
01:48:01,110 --> 01:48:04,040
they're actually alive if it's not 
animation.

2563
01:48:04,250 --> 01:48:05,670
These are real people.

2564
01:48:05,730 --> 01:48:06,890
No,
Eddie,

2565
01:48:06,930 --> 01:48:07,720
there's their,
their,

2566
01:48:07,730 --> 01:48:09,900
their setup fits fake reality.

2567
01:48:09,960 --> 01:48:12,460
It's sometime or whatever it is.

2568
01:48:13,090 --> 01:48:15,180
Hold on though.
Did you see sneaky get punched?

2569
01:48:15,181 --> 01:48:16,490
That shit was not fake.
It's.

2570
01:48:16,570 --> 01:48:19,210
That was.
That was one or season two,

2571
01:48:19,420 --> 01:48:24,420
but yeah,
but the majority of the shit now is 

2572
01:48:24,420 --> 01:48:24,420
like,
hey,

2573
01:48:24,420 --> 01:48:24,420
we're going to put snookie inside this 
barbershop,

2574
01:48:24,420 --> 01:48:24,730
barber,
barbershops,

2575
01:48:24,731 --> 01:48:27,160
super gay because we cast him gay,
you know,

2576
01:48:27,161 --> 01:48:29,710
and it's just gonna be ridiculous.
It's completely fake.

2577
01:48:29,711 --> 01:48:33,010
And you know what's even worse about the
whole fucking Jersey shore thing is that

2578
01:48:33,011 --> 01:48:34,660
new movie,
a three stooges.

2579
01:48:34,750 --> 01:48:39,750
How might.
This is a classic franchise that's been 

2580
01:48:39,750 --> 01:48:42,181
rebooted in the trailer.
Fucking snookie's in it and it's just 

2581
01:48:42,181 --> 01:48:42,710
like this,
this derby.

2582
01:48:43,730 --> 01:48:45,260
I love her.
I just want her to talk.

2583
01:48:45,470 --> 01:48:49,190
Her and Dina Dina's,
her best friend.

2584
01:48:49,370 --> 01:48:54,350
She's amazing.
It's incredible.

2585
01:48:54,650 --> 01:48:59,650
All they do,
every episode is going to be a part in 

2586
01:48:59,650 --> 01:49:03,701
the episode where they're all getting 
ready to go out and they're all doing 

2587
01:49:03,701 --> 01:49:03,701
their fucking hair and putting on their 
makeup.

2588
01:49:03,701 --> 01:49:07,490
They go to Karma and it's the same shit.
You know that's crazy about it is those,

2589
01:49:07,610 --> 01:49:12,610
they are so retarded that you would 
think with all the cameras,

2590
01:49:12,920 --> 01:49:17,920
with all the cameras and all their fame,
that they would have girls crawling all 

2591
01:49:18,231 --> 01:49:23,231
over them.
Girls would you would you would think 

2592
01:49:23,231 --> 01:49:26,321
none of the girl.
You would think that guys would have 

2593
01:49:26,321 --> 01:49:26,870
girls crawling all over them,
but it's not what you think.

2594
01:49:26,871 --> 01:49:30,050
It's like girls don't want to go back to
that house and be on TV.

2595
01:49:30,310 --> 01:49:35,310
Fuck yeah.
Not only are going to get fucking loser 

2596
01:49:35,310 --> 01:49:39,640
credible.
They go out and they go out and 

2597
01:49:39,640 --> 01:49:42,390
sometimes they don't get pussy.
They got cameras all over them and 

2598
01:49:42,390 --> 01:49:45,941
they're super famous and they have 
fucking bad nights and the girls are 

2599
01:49:45,941 --> 01:49:48,170
banging or like regular fucking skis

2600
01:49:48,420 --> 01:49:52,180
is that they've been banging for a long 
time that they're incredible.

2601
01:49:52,290 --> 01:49:57,290
It's like a big edge though.
That's as good as Jersey shore is as 

2602
01:49:57,290 --> 01:50:00,430
good as Jersey shore is the best show on
TV.

2603
01:50:00,580 --> 01:50:04,180
Nothing flux with mob wives do.
If you haven't watched mom lives,

2604
01:50:04,181 --> 01:50:07,660
go fuck yourself.
That is the watch that you watch.

2605
01:50:07,970 --> 01:50:08,960
Watch,
watch,

2606
01:50:09,810 --> 01:50:10,330
watch.
You know.

2607
01:50:10,390 --> 01:50:12,940
The problem is I knew too many of those 
women,

2608
01:50:12,970 --> 01:50:17,970
those women that I knew,
guys that were like in and they would 

2609
01:50:17,970 --> 01:50:22,541
like fucking threatened you.
I'll fucking make one phone call right 

2610
01:50:22,541 --> 01:50:26,371
now.
These bitches are just fighting every 

2611
01:50:26,371 --> 01:50:28,630
episode they want and they have money.
They're in their forties.

2612
01:50:28,660 --> 01:50:33,660
You would think they would have some 
class the last few years on their 

2613
01:50:33,660 --> 01:50:34,420
twitters.
Oh yeah,

2614
01:50:34,421 --> 01:50:35,890
I do.
I follow all of wife.

2615
01:50:35,891 --> 01:50:38,200
The one is divorced and she keeps 
calling her ex husband.

2616
01:50:38,201 --> 01:50:42,040
This man disrespected me one with the 
big head.

2617
01:50:42,140 --> 01:50:44,850
Oh wait a minute.
Ralphie May.

2618
01:50:44,850 --> 01:50:48,070
Is her husband out of jail are in jail.
Her husband divorced her.

2619
01:50:48,130 --> 01:50:53,130
I don't know.
You think he was about to go to jail 

2620
01:50:53,130 --> 01:50:53,130
again?
The doll?

2621
01:50:53,130 --> 01:50:53,130
Yeah.
Yeah.

2622
01:50:53,130 --> 01:50:54,250
That's.
That's a skill it to Reagan.

2623
01:50:54,280 --> 01:50:55,360
He's Puerto Rican.
He's Puerto Rican.

2624
01:50:56,620 --> 01:50:58,210
He's Puerto Rican.
Her father,

2625
01:50:58,630 --> 01:51:03,630
they're saying that she married,
she married or he married a to get into 

2626
01:51:04,241 --> 01:51:05,860
the model.
That's what they're saying.

2627
01:51:06,530 --> 01:51:09,810
They're accusing.
Her name is Hector Judea.

2628
01:51:10,280 --> 01:51:12,150
Really?
How many fucking Italians you know,

2629
01:51:12,360 --> 01:51:14,050
name is hector.
He's cute,

2630
01:51:14,051 --> 01:51:19,051
but what happened was,
remember we had this discussion the 

2631
01:51:19,051 --> 01:51:19,051
other day.
I read her sweater.

2632
01:51:19,051 --> 01:51:19,990
Staten Island was a fucking garbage 
dump.

2633
01:51:19,991 --> 01:51:21,080
Brooke,
by the fucking Indians,

2634
01:51:21,110 --> 01:51:23,080
just really put the Indians.
They throw him out of New York.

2635
01:51:23,600 --> 01:51:24,940
Then they decided,
fuck,

2636
01:51:24,941 --> 01:51:29,941
we got this property over there.
Let's build on fucking staten island 

2637
01:51:29,941 --> 01:51:29,941
with garbage.
Got Hill.

2638
01:51:29,941 --> 01:51:30,370
So it was all just garbage.

2639
01:51:30,450 --> 01:51:33,460
It used to half of it was a dump.
That's why when you're driving Bro,

2640
01:51:33,461 --> 01:51:36,530
it's 20 minutes from Jersey.
That way that's when they give you.

2641
01:51:36,890 --> 01:51:39,580
Tell you what Staten Island to me wasn't
doing all.

2642
01:51:39,581 --> 01:51:44,581
Like when I used to do gigs in New York,
Staten Island had the most unfriendly 

2643
01:51:44,581 --> 01:51:45,550
environment.
There was one club.

2644
01:51:45,551 --> 01:51:47,950
I'm standing on GRANDPA's.
That was.

2645
01:51:49,720 --> 01:51:51,880
They wouldn't give you a seat for your 
girlfriend.

2646
01:51:52,090 --> 01:51:55,060
You would show up with your girlfriend.
They would like to sit down in the back.

2647
01:51:55,090 --> 01:51:58,330
No.
You see two for customers like wow,

2648
01:51:58,390 --> 01:52:03,390
like your performance,
like they don't even have like a little 

2649
01:52:03,390 --> 01:52:05,251
site,
little spot where the performer can sit 

2650
01:52:05,251 --> 01:52:05,710
down and your girlfriend can sit down.
Like they would want you to,

2651
01:52:06,080 --> 01:52:07,870
you know,
go stand outside.

2652
01:52:07,871 --> 01:52:09,190
Stupid.
You're not a part of the show.

2653
01:52:09,310 --> 01:52:11,350
I went to.
Let's just a weird vibe.

2654
01:52:11,680 --> 01:52:14,680
Let's start with the one time because I 
got sick and tired to go to Harlem.

2655
01:52:14,800 --> 01:52:19,800
If they caught you weeded Harlem on the 
way back from Jersey would confiscate 

2656
01:52:19,800 --> 01:52:22,300
your car because you were interested in 
transporting over federal lines.

2657
01:52:22,950 --> 01:52:24,340
Those bridges in that tunnel?
Yeah.

2658
01:52:24,341 --> 01:52:29,341
That cute.
But if they catch you bringing drugs 

2659
01:52:29,341 --> 01:52:29,341
over,
your car gets confiscated.

2660
01:52:29,970 --> 01:52:32,410
It is in California,
so that's what happened there.

2661
01:52:32,620 --> 01:52:37,620
So they would wave.
So you had to go in through the George 

2662
01:52:37,620 --> 01:52:41,160
Washington and come back to the Lincoln 
tunnel after everyday you get sick of 

2663
01:52:41,160 --> 01:52:43,621
gold over there for weed.
They said the Jamaicans had gun to 

2664
01:52:43,621 --> 01:52:43,621
Staten Island.
Okay.

2665
01:52:43,621 --> 01:52:45,130
There's a Jamaican able to stand down 
when they sold the best.

2666
01:52:45,290 --> 01:52:48,050
So one day 94 being my buddy go over 
there.

2667
01:52:48,530 --> 01:52:49,930
No biggie.
We drive in Papa,

2668
01:52:49,940 --> 01:52:50,900
Papa,
Papa will,

2669
01:52:50,901 --> 01:52:52,710
looking for black people.
We can't fucking find.

2670
01:52:52,750 --> 01:52:55,880
We can find.
I can't smell though fucking incense.

2671
01:52:55,881 --> 01:52:57,350
I can't do nothing.
Right.

2672
01:52:57,830 --> 01:52:58,850
And all of a sudden what do I see?

2673
01:52:58,850 --> 01:53:03,850
I see 20 fucking Guido's on a quarter 
with white tee shirts on with white 

2674
01:53:03,850 --> 01:53:06,290
shoes on Pinky rings the whole day I 
pull up,

2675
01:53:06,490 --> 01:53:07,180
you know,
at the light.

2676
01:53:07,190 --> 01:53:08,600
They're like,
what are you who you are looking for?

2677
01:53:09,110 --> 01:53:10,970
Not that we're looking for a little bit.
Pull over,

2678
01:53:11,300 --> 01:53:12,020
pull over.
Come on.

2679
01:53:12,021 --> 01:53:12,710
Over and before,
you know,

2680
01:53:12,711 --> 01:53:14,060
have 20th Italians around.
Yeah.

2681
01:53:14,061 --> 01:53:15,770
What are you looking for?
I want a 20.

2682
01:53:16,220 --> 01:53:21,220
Alright.
Park the fucking car and go into the 

2683
01:53:21,220 --> 01:53:23,501
fucking pizza places.
Somebody will come up that I parked the 

2684
01:53:23,501 --> 01:53:23,501
car and my buddy.
You know what?

2685
01:53:23,501 --> 01:53:25,160
I'm hungry.
I go to the pizza place.

2686
01:53:25,161 --> 01:53:26,450
Guy Comes in.
What do you want?

2687
01:53:26,740 --> 01:53:27,770
I want a 20.
Okay,

2688
01:53:28,040 --> 01:53:30,020
listen from now on,
when you come over here,

2689
01:53:30,380 --> 01:53:33,710
you see fucking whatever his name was.
Angelo [inaudible] us for Angela.

2690
01:53:33,711 --> 01:53:34,610
No problem.
Okay.

2691
01:53:35,150 --> 01:53:37,640
One day it snows a month later.
You know what?

2692
01:53:37,640 --> 01:53:40,040
I don't want to go into this city.
Let's go on to Staten Island real quick.

2693
01:53:40,041 --> 01:53:42,260
The weed wasn't bad.
I pull up.

2694
01:53:42,290 --> 01:53:44,630
I don't see Angelo.
I don't see nobody.

2695
01:53:44,631 --> 01:53:45,840
Actually.
20 fucking gillies.

2696
01:53:45,890 --> 01:53:46,550
I don't know.
None of them.

2697
01:53:46,551 --> 01:53:51,551
I pull over.
I go into a pizza place within 15 

2698
01:53:51,551 --> 01:53:51,650
minutes.
I had 15 Italians in there.

2699
01:53:51,651 --> 01:53:54,950
Three of them were bats.
We don't hear disrespected.

2700
01:53:55,220 --> 01:53:57,920
We polled you when you come up here.
You got to see Angelo.

2701
01:53:57,921 --> 01:53:59,360
You want asking for Louis?
I didn't ask her.

2702
01:53:59,361 --> 01:54:02,930
Nobody asks for fucking slice of Pizza.
It was an hour and a half drama.

2703
01:54:02,931 --> 01:54:05,780
They get a $20 bag of weed.
Where's the wind?

2704
01:54:05,781 --> 01:54:07,350
You know what we did?
I don't know what a witness.

2705
01:54:07,460 --> 01:54:09,760
What a witness and I was like,
you don't want.

2706
01:54:10,510 --> 01:54:13,760
It was too much for me Bro.
It was too much for me.

2707
01:54:13,761 --> 01:54:16,280
It was just one island vibes and bad 
vibes.

2708
01:54:16,310 --> 01:54:21,310
The pizza was delicious.
The bread was delicious to everything 

2709
01:54:21,310 --> 01:54:24,281
was great,
but I never went back over there and 

2710
01:54:24,281 --> 01:54:25,990
that's what I see when I watched my 
spots like was not comfortable for you.

2711
01:54:26,510 --> 01:54:27,620
That's the first.
Last year,

2712
01:54:27,680 --> 01:54:30,210
and this is why once he a good father,
good father Ted,

2713
01:54:31,040 --> 01:54:33,850
who you with,
that's the person they asked you.

2714
01:54:34,340 --> 01:54:35,940
Not with nobody I came with.
No,

2715
01:54:35,960 --> 01:54:36,500
no,
no,

2716
01:54:36,530 --> 01:54:37,370
no.
Eddie Bravo.

2717
01:54:37,410 --> 01:54:40,820
Who by the way reinforced by all those 
shitty mom movies.

2718
01:54:41,060 --> 01:54:46,060
You know.
So many people got a bronx tale and all 

2719
01:54:46,060 --> 01:54:47,120
these different.
Bronxdale wasn't that bad,

2720
01:54:47,121 --> 01:54:49,330
but I got the greatest movie of all 
time.

2721
01:54:49,360 --> 01:54:52,270
They were all great movies.
There's a great bunch of them.

2722
01:54:53,160 --> 01:54:54,800
Father too,
and I forgot to tell you some.

2723
01:54:54,860 --> 01:54:57,140
It's better than the fucking the first 
movie ever.

2724
01:54:57,620 --> 01:55:02,620
That's better than the first one.
Not to me because Marlon Brando is rock 

2725
01:55:02,620 --> 01:55:02,840
over fucking everything.

2726
01:55:03,260 --> 01:55:08,260
You know what I'm saying?
It was rocket when he told us that 

2727
01:55:08,260 --> 01:55:08,260
motherfucker at the table that,
you know what?

2728
01:55:08,260 --> 01:55:11,120
I do have all this situation here.
My son has to come back,

2729
01:55:11,450 --> 01:55:14,330
but if for some of fortunate fucking 
situation,

2730
01:55:14,540 --> 01:55:18,500
he should be struck by a bolt of 
lightning or he should be handled at his

2731
01:55:18,501 --> 01:55:23,501
fucking jail cell.
I will blame the people at this table 

2732
01:55:23,501 --> 01:55:26,030
and that I will not fucking forgive.
That's the greatest speech at the top of

2733
01:55:26,031 --> 01:55:26,750
the arm.
The data,

2734
01:55:27,590 --> 01:55:32,590
stupid.
He didn't know he douchebag wants to be 

2735
01:55:32,590 --> 01:55:32,590
that guy.
Marlin Brando was beautiful.

2736
01:55:32,590 --> 01:55:35,240
The fucking studio book.
After he did that,

2737
01:55:35,310 --> 01:55:37,890
listen,
Marlon Brando than ever.

2738
01:55:38,020 --> 01:55:43,020
The Marlon Brando was one of my idols 
because he told Hollywood to suck his 

2739
01:55:43,020 --> 01:55:46,571
dick.
He went down to a lot of men suck his 

2740
01:55:46,571 --> 01:55:46,860
dick.
I have a photo of it.

2741
01:55:46,861 --> 01:55:50,700
If you put on the bounty,
he went down to mutiny on the bounty and

2742
01:55:50,701 --> 01:55:51,780
bought a fucking island.

2743
01:55:51,840 --> 01:55:54,330
Nobody's ever bought an island.
Nobody's ever been that fucking quit.

2744
01:55:54,540 --> 01:55:56,580
Tyler Perry after.
Now.

2745
01:55:57,160 --> 01:55:59,890
This was 1970.
It was motherfucker and then impregnated

2746
01:55:59,900 --> 01:56:02,220
half the women on that island.
All of them are named Marlin.

2747
01:56:02,250 --> 01:56:04,290
Every fucking killing.
It was Marlon Brando.

2748
01:56:04,440 --> 01:56:06,070
That was part of living on the island.
You got to suck.

2749
01:56:06,270 --> 01:56:10,050
There was this island off the coast of 
Hawaii or say wherever you shot,

2750
01:56:10,260 --> 01:56:12,180
what that thing.
I went to Dr Moreau.

2751
01:56:12,181 --> 01:56:17,181
Warner brothers went down there and 
wherever the fucking people what it 

2752
01:56:17,181 --> 01:56:18,630
looked at the tapes and you're like,
what is this birds and pigeons where you

2753
01:56:18,631 --> 01:56:23,631
been?
Where the fuck you been for the last 

2754
01:56:23,631 --> 01:56:23,631
month?
He,

2755
01:56:23,631 --> 01:56:23,631
he's like,
God,

2756
01:56:23,631 --> 01:56:25,440
that'd be fucking these Hawaiian chicks 
up the ass a great fucking time.

2757
01:56:25,570 --> 01:56:26,030
So,
um,

2758
01:56:26,040 --> 01:56:27,840
when the godfather came along,
they didn't want them.

2759
01:56:27,841 --> 01:56:32,841
They're like,
this guy wasted millions of fucking 

2760
01:56:32,841 --> 01:56:32,841
dollars.
Yeah.

2761
01:56:32,841 --> 01:56:32,841
Put that up here.

2762
01:56:32,841 --> 01:56:32,841
Put that up here.
Brian.

2763
01:56:33,220 --> 01:56:34,860
Put that up.
Put that up.

2764
01:56:35,040 --> 01:56:35,640
Look at this.
Oh,

2765
01:56:35,641 --> 01:56:36,930
you can't do it on Ustream,
right?

2766
01:56:38,200 --> 01:56:40,710
But if you just Google Marlin Brando 
Sucking Dick,

2767
01:56:40,711 --> 01:56:43,740
it's actually an artistic shot that 
really stopped the car.

2768
01:56:44,990 --> 01:56:49,990
That's how big the motherfucker.
And he doesn't even look that fat back 

2769
01:56:49,990 --> 01:56:49,990
then.
Kills the fucking.

2770
01:56:50,460 --> 01:56:51,590
Listen,
I got to Boogie with Stu.

2771
01:56:51,600 --> 01:56:53,880
I love you.
I'll see you Thursday night.

2772
01:56:53,881 --> 01:56:56,790
I got to.
I need six up under the Bob Hope.

2773
01:56:56,791 --> 01:56:58,290
Fucking senator to get everything in 
shape.

2774
01:56:58,500 --> 01:57:02,070
Don't forget payloads.
Don't forget fucking kill you.

2775
01:57:02,071 --> 01:57:03,550
Motherfucker.
Pay Load.

2776
01:57:03,640 --> 01:57:08,640
Bravo.
Don't forget the Sandy Bravo a gift for 

2777
01:57:08,640 --> 01:57:08,640
his fucking kid on twitter.
Send it to.

2778
01:57:08,640 --> 01:57:09,210
Oh,
some guy emailed me.

2779
01:57:09,211 --> 01:57:14,211
They bought you a camera cock sucker.
So I want them points Thursday and 

2780
01:57:18,990 --> 01:57:20,610
Friday night we're going to have a good 
time.

2781
01:57:20,670 --> 01:57:21,840
House of Blues,

2782
01:57:21,841 --> 01:57:24,360
Mandalay Bay,
Duncan Trussell,

2783
01:57:24,361 --> 01:57:25,570
Joe Diaz need

2784
01:57:25,660 --> 01:57:30,660
the whole pile.
And one more thing I wanted to talk 

2785
01:57:30,660 --> 01:57:30,660
about before we get out of here because 
this is pretty fucking fascinating shit.

2786
01:57:30,660 --> 01:57:31,690
You know,
we talked about that,

2787
01:57:31,691 --> 01:57:34,270
uh,
the problem in the ocean that big a pile

2788
01:57:34,271 --> 01:57:38,140
of a plastic that they have the garbage 
patch,

2789
01:57:38,170 --> 01:57:43,170
they just found them a mushroom and the 
Amazon that eats indestructible 

2790
01:57:43,170 --> 01:57:43,750
plastics.
Wow.

2791
01:57:43,990 --> 01:57:45,880
Yeah.
It's pretty fucking nuts man.

2792
01:57:45,900 --> 01:57:50,900
So we're gonna throw a bunch of 
mushrooms on it and then the water's 

2793
01:57:50,900 --> 01:57:50,900
going to be all trippy and we're all 
gonna.

2794
01:57:50,900 --> 01:57:51,210
Die Eats

2795
01:57:51,230 --> 01:57:56,230

The mushroom is called pedal lot too.

2796
01:57:56,630 --> 01:57:58,580
Sis.
Pedal up top assists.

2797
01:57:58,581 --> 01:58:03,581

t opsis,
Pesta Lottie opsis Mike grow spora.

2799
01:58:09,570 --> 01:58:13,010
Why do they ask the name of the stuff 
with the Latin?

2800
01:58:13,070 --> 01:58:13,970
Let it go,
bitch.

2801
01:58:14,000 --> 01:58:15,920
It's 2012,
you know,

2802
01:58:15,950 --> 01:58:17,720
awesome.
Plastic eating mushrooms,

2803
01:58:17,780 --> 01:58:22,780
that's the official name.
It's spelled p e s t a l o t I o p s I s

2804
01:58:26,570 --> 01:58:31,570
micro s p o r a.
So it's a resident of the Ecuadorian 

2805
01:58:33,100 --> 01:58:38,100
rainforest and was discovered by a group
of student researchers led by molecular 

2806
01:58:38,100 --> 01:58:42,611
biochemistry professor Scott Strobel as 
a part of Yale's annual rainforest 

2807
01:58:42,611 --> 01:58:44,290
expedition and laboratory.
You know,

2808
01:58:44,291 --> 01:58:45,310
they go down there,
man,

2809
01:58:45,311 --> 01:58:50,311
they have these scientists and these 
researchers go down there and every now 

2810
01:58:50,311 --> 01:58:53,551
and then they'll find some fucking crazy
shit that there's like all sorts of 

2811
01:58:53,551 --> 01:58:53,830
medicines that have come out of the rain
forest,

2812
01:58:53,980 --> 01:58:58,980
incredible psychedelic drugs,
all kinds of nutty fucking things in 

2813
01:58:58,980 --> 01:58:59,590
that shoe,
in that bitch up every day.

2814
01:58:59,620 --> 01:59:03,430
So the mushroom like disintegrates the,
the plastics or what's the,

2815
01:59:03,440 --> 01:59:04,540
do it,
eats it,

2816
01:59:04,541 --> 01:59:08,030
it's able to the fungus species will it 
absorb,

2817
01:59:08,060 --> 01:59:09,290
you know,
mushrooms absorb things.

2818
01:59:09,500 --> 01:59:09,840
They,
they,

2819
01:59:09,960 --> 01:59:11,430
you know,
it's really like they're,

2820
01:59:11,520 --> 01:59:12,540
they're the,
the,

2821
01:59:12,770 --> 01:59:17,770
it's Karma.
It's like Karma free living the way 

2822
01:59:17,770 --> 01:59:17,770
mushrooms live their speech.
They literally live in Shit.

2823
01:59:17,980 --> 01:59:22,980
You know,
they lived the most humble life 

2824
01:59:22,980 --> 01:59:22,980
possible,
but there it's a living organism.

2825
01:59:22,980 --> 01:59:24,760
It's the first fungus species to able 
to,

2826
01:59:24,930 --> 01:59:28,510
to be able to survive exclusively on 
polyurethane.

2827
01:59:29,140 --> 01:59:32,770
So it lives on fucking indestructible 
plastic.

2828
01:59:32,890 --> 01:59:37,890
And more importantly,
it's able to do that in anaerobic 

2829
01:59:37,890 --> 01:59:37,960
conditions,
meaning the same conditions found in the

2830
01:59:37,961 --> 01:59:42,961
bottom of landfills.
And this makes this fungus a prime 

2831
01:59:42,961 --> 01:59:46,060
candidate for bio read remediation,
remediation,

2832
01:59:46,090 --> 01:59:51,090
bio remediation projects that could 
finally provide an alternative to just 

2833
01:59:51,090 --> 01:59:53,080
burning plastic and hoping for the best.
I wonder how long that process takes.

2834
01:59:53,080 --> 01:59:55,930
Like are we talking about like 30 years,
million years?

2835
01:59:55,931 --> 01:59:58,090
But at least it's better than what the 
plans now.

2836
01:59:58,230 --> 02:00:00,340
Now they need to find some shit that a 
nuclear waste.

2837
02:00:01,310 --> 02:00:03,260
It's probably in the Amazon.
It's probably a frog.

2838
02:00:03,280 --> 02:00:04,960
Probably snookie.
It's a frog.

2839
02:00:04,961 --> 02:00:07,300
They're going to give it this frog.
It's gonna eat nuclear waste.

2840
02:00:07,301 --> 02:00:08,950
And that's going to become fucking 
Godzilla.

2841
02:00:09,850 --> 02:00:12,520
Oh No.
There goes Tokyo.

2842
02:00:12,570 --> 02:00:13,810
Go,
go Godzilla.

2843
02:00:14,140 --> 02:00:16,960
Danny proper goes to want to step up to 
the mic and to be on the podcast here.

2844
02:00:16,961 --> 02:00:21,961
Sign is our boy danny.
We've known Danny since he was a little 

2845
02:00:21,961 --> 02:00:25,561
child since he was a small boy.
And now he's a black belt world 

2846
02:00:25,561 --> 02:00:26,680
champion.
First Tenth Planet Jujitsu,

2847
02:00:26,681 --> 02:00:31,681
black belts.
The viewers have been looking at his 

2848
02:00:31,681 --> 02:00:31,910
feet for the last two hours.
That phones headphones.

2849
02:00:32,220 --> 02:00:37,220
Okay,
so everybody knows that you know what 

2850
02:00:37,220 --> 02:00:39,451
you sound like much,
but at the gracie nationals this past 

2851
02:00:39,451 --> 02:00:43,230
Sunday,
not only did 10th planet get the first 

2852
02:00:43,230 --> 02:00:43,230
place,
team title,

2853
02:00:43,230 --> 02:00:48,140
the Gracie nationals,
but Danny also got got first place in 

2854
02:00:48,140 --> 02:00:49,210
his division tapping out to black belts.

2855
02:00:49,210 --> 02:00:54,210
He twisted a Joe Merera black belt and 
he guillotine UFC star Damn Fan.

2856
02:00:57,250 --> 02:01:02,250
Denny Denny had a.
He kept off of an epic day for 10th 

2857
02:01:02,861 --> 02:01:06,430
Planet and there was a flying d isn't 
going flying one jumped up.

2858
02:01:06,530 --> 02:01:06,840
No,
no,

2859
02:01:06,841 --> 02:01:07,210
no,
no.

2860
02:01:07,300 --> 02:01:09,460
He shot in for a single leg on my right 
leg.

2861
02:01:09,850 --> 02:01:14,850
And uh,
I just wrapped his neck and I drove my 

2862
02:01:14,850 --> 02:01:16,450
hips and he fell back.
I hooked his right leg with a triangle,

2863
02:01:16,690 --> 02:01:19,180
stepped over with my right leg,
crossed my feet,

2864
02:01:19,181 --> 02:01:20,590
arched my hips,
looked up.

2865
02:01:21,750 --> 02:01:23,110
It was amazing,
man.

2866
02:01:23,111 --> 02:01:26,780
It was just getting nasty.
We know Denison's what we,

2867
02:01:26,830 --> 02:01:28,600
what were you like a purple belt when 
you started training with that?

2868
02:01:28,610 --> 02:01:29,750
A blue belt.
Blue,

2869
02:01:29,800 --> 02:01:30,420
blue,
blue.

2870
02:01:31,120 --> 02:01:32,420
But I started,
actually,

2871
02:01:32,440 --> 02:01:34,060
no,
I started training with Eddie when I was

2872
02:01:34,061 --> 02:01:36,190
an orange belt.
Uh,

2873
02:01:36,280 --> 02:01:37,630
but.
So that's like little kids.

2874
02:01:37,710 --> 02:01:38,740
Yeah,
I was 15.

2875
02:01:39,090 --> 02:01:40,270
Let me go

2876
02:01:40,920 --> 02:01:43,280
tell them about our first private 
lesson.

2877
02:01:43,281 --> 02:01:45,710
He lives in San Francisco.
He's been there the whole time.

2878
02:01:45,770 --> 02:01:48,320
I'm in La.
I had just opened up.

2879
02:01:48,380 --> 02:01:52,400
I had my first school open for maybe two
years and uh,

2880
02:01:52,610 --> 02:01:57,610
I'll never forget,
I'll never forget when it was after our 

2881
02:01:57,610 --> 02:02:01,121
tournament.
Me and a couple of well known Jujitsu 

2882
02:02:01,121 --> 02:02:04,091
players were in the parking lot,
smoking some weed in our car and here's 

2883
02:02:04,091 --> 02:02:04,490
this little kid,
like two cars away,

2884
02:02:04,491 --> 02:02:08,240
just standing there looking at us and 
we're like trying to hide the,

2885
02:02:08,241 --> 02:02:09,920
we'd like to know there's a kid that 
hide the weed.

2886
02:02:10,040 --> 02:02:12,590
We're like hiding the weed and he knew 
exactly what we're doing.

2887
02:02:12,890 --> 02:02:15,920
Like Ah.
And then we came up in San Francisco.

2888
02:02:16,060 --> 02:02:16,630
Yes.
Yeah,

2889
02:02:16,640 --> 02:02:20,990
he drove down for the kids.
Learn about weed when they're three.

2890
02:02:21,080 --> 02:02:23,180
Dude,
it's been legal there for like 30 years.

2891
02:02:23,720 --> 02:02:24,680
Nobody gives a fuck.

2892
02:02:24,800 --> 02:02:29,800
I got it.
The first time I got offered a smoke 

2893
02:02:29,800 --> 02:02:29,800
was,
I was in fourth grade.

2894
02:02:29,800 --> 02:02:30,530
There was this.
Tell us about,

2895
02:02:30,560 --> 02:02:33,470
tell us about your first experience 
with,

2896
02:02:33,471 --> 02:02:35,690
um,
like remember your birthday and all that

2897
02:02:35,691 --> 02:02:36,860
kind of stuff.
Oh yeah.

2898
02:02:36,910 --> 02:02:40,430
Uh,
so for my 15th birthday,

2899
02:02:40,830 --> 02:02:45,830
uh,
my brother and I were going to go down 

2900
02:02:45,830 --> 02:02:46,730
to the scree convention.
It was like this Greek dancing thing and

2901
02:02:46,731 --> 02:02:47,600
I'm like,
all right,

2902
02:02:47,601 --> 02:02:49,730
I want to,
I want to take a private with Eddie,

2903
02:02:49,760 --> 02:02:52,050
you know.
And uh,

2904
02:02:52,850 --> 02:02:57,850
he taught me the rubber guard back then.
He actually taught me London and taught 

2905
02:02:57,850 --> 02:03:00,380
me the invisible color,
the basic path and uh,

2906
02:03:00,650 --> 02:03:05,650
taught me some twister stuff,
taught me the meat hook and I basically 

2907
02:03:05,650 --> 02:03:07,790
went back and all the stuff,
I've videotaped it.

2908
02:03:08,000 --> 02:03:13,000
He is,
he had his brother drive down from San 

2909
02:03:13,000 --> 02:03:13,000
Francisco,
so it was pretty cool.

2910
02:03:13,000 --> 02:03:17,010
So that's pretty crazy.
I had this kid and I usually don't do 

2911
02:03:17,010 --> 02:03:17,010
privates,
but this kid shows up and I'm like,

2912
02:03:17,790 --> 02:03:22,790
you know what I have,
I like to save all my energy for my 

2913
02:03:22,790 --> 02:03:23,790
group classes.
I really don't have energy for privates.

2914
02:03:23,810 --> 02:03:27,350
Really just rarely do I give them and he
comes down,

2915
02:03:27,351 --> 02:03:32,351
you know,
there's 15 year old kid drove all the 

2916
02:03:32,351 --> 02:03:32,351
way from Frisco.
I'm like,

2917
02:03:32,351 --> 02:03:33,080
okay.
And he ended up.

2918
02:03:33,230 --> 02:03:34,460
I knew right there,
right.

2919
02:03:34,520 --> 02:03:37,850
I knew that this guy,
there was something special about them.

2920
02:03:38,180 --> 02:03:39,530
I knew that.
I mean,

2921
02:03:39,531 --> 02:03:44,531
if he's willing to drive all the way 
down from San Francisco to take a 

2922
02:03:44,531 --> 02:03:44,570
private,
that he's down for life.

2923
02:03:44,600 --> 02:03:45,860
This guy was.
Yeah,

2924
02:03:45,861 --> 02:03:48,710
that's most of the most important thing 
that anybody could ever show.

2925
02:03:48,711 --> 02:03:53,711
It was just,
if you want to be successful at 

2926
02:03:53,711 --> 02:03:55,451
something,
you have to be really fucking dedicated 

2927
02:03:55,451 --> 02:03:55,451
to it.

2928
02:03:55,451 --> 02:03:57,680
Really dedicated and doing something 
like that come all the way down from San

2929
02:03:57,680 --> 02:03:58,300
Francisco.
That shows him.

2930
02:03:58,301 --> 02:04:01,580
It never waver because even to this day,
to this day,

2931
02:04:01,581 --> 02:04:04,300
I'm not just saying this to this day,
he's,

2932
02:04:04,510 --> 02:04:07,280
he's definitely the most decorated 10th 
planet.

2933
02:04:08,180 --> 02:04:08,590
Yeah.
He's,

2934
02:04:08,840 --> 02:04:11,420
he's,
he's one of the most titles.

2935
02:04:11,600 --> 02:04:14,240
He's competed the most at the highest 
levels.

2936
02:04:14,480 --> 02:04:15,920
Um,
in straight grappling.

2937
02:04:15,921 --> 02:04:20,921
I have guys that have done mma and 
they've done well like Scott Epstein at 

2938
02:04:20,921 --> 02:04:21,560
all,
but it pure grappling denny has done the

2939
02:04:21,561 --> 02:04:26,561
most and it's because he.
He drills and practices way more than 

2940
02:04:28,190 --> 02:04:32,630
anybody I know.
I mean he's a Jujitsu fanatic.

2941
02:04:32,810 --> 02:04:34,910
Not only does like yesterday.
We're rolling.

2942
02:04:35,240 --> 02:04:39,390
We're rolling and every move,
every little trick I had,

2943
02:04:39,391 --> 02:04:41,610
even the latest shit,
the latest tricks,

2944
02:04:42,090 --> 02:04:44,970
he would call it out.
He would tell me what I was thinking.

2945
02:04:45,030 --> 02:04:50,030
Nobody can do that.
Nobody can break down the 10th planet 

2946
02:04:50,030 --> 02:04:54,321
system like Danny,
tell me exactly how I'm planning to 

2947
02:04:54,321 --> 02:04:54,420
trick them.
I've never had anybody do that.

2948
02:04:54,421 --> 02:04:56,850
He was calling everything out.
It was fucking me up like,

2949
02:04:56,851 --> 02:04:58,680
Holy Shit,
this guy's reading my mind.

2950
02:04:58,830 --> 02:05:03,270
He studies the template system like no 
one else and he studies the.

2951
02:05:03,271 --> 02:05:05,280
All the new games that are coming up 
like,

2952
02:05:05,440 --> 02:05:07,890
like all the 50 slash 50 stuff,
all the leg lock,

2953
02:05:07,891 --> 02:05:12,891
all the latest stuff that the Brazilians
are coming up with like halfway on 

2954
02:05:12,891 --> 02:05:14,130
Mendez and Cabrina all the spiral and 
della Hiva.

2955
02:05:14,250 --> 02:05:17,730
This guy studies it.
Like he has ocd,

2956
02:05:18,000 --> 02:05:19,770
like,
like he's obsessed.

2957
02:05:19,880 --> 02:05:22,150
He's definitely focused,
it's important

2958
02:05:22,440 --> 02:05:24,180
to be around people like that,
you know,

2959
02:05:24,680 --> 02:05:29,680
in life there's always people that are 
willing to take things to another level 

2960
02:05:29,680 --> 02:05:29,680
that are learning quicker than everybody
else,

2961
02:05:29,680 --> 02:05:31,800
to have more passion that's so 
important.

2962
02:05:32,280 --> 02:05:33,030
So important.

2963
02:05:33,160 --> 02:05:35,880
And it rubs off on a student's.
Check this at this,

2964
02:05:35,950 --> 02:05:36,770
at the.
I had,

2965
02:05:36,771 --> 02:05:38,650
uh,
maybe about seven or eight of my schools

2966
02:05:38,651 --> 02:05:40,740
compete at the tournament and his 
school,

2967
02:05:40,741 --> 02:05:43,000
the San Francisco school by far did the 
best.

2968
02:05:43,150 --> 02:05:45,410
They were 12 in one.
All that.

2969
02:05:45,420 --> 02:05:50,420
He had four guys competing 12 in one.
And the one loss was in the finals.

2970
02:05:51,130 --> 02:05:54,820
It was like a 30 minute match,
37 minute match and the guy lost,

2971
02:05:54,821 --> 02:05:56,080
but it was,
he didn't even tap.

2972
02:05:56,081 --> 02:05:58,120
He went to sleep.
That's incredible though.

2973
02:05:58,121 --> 02:05:59,800
Thirty seven minutes.
That's amazing.

2974
02:05:59,920 --> 02:06:04,920
I mean he's got incredible students like
future stars like Adam Sachin offi 

2975
02:06:04,920 --> 02:06:07,270
called big Red Adam sached office 230 
pounds.

2976
02:06:07,360 --> 02:06:12,360
His Rubber Guard is insane and he's got 
black belt level guillotines and 

2977
02:06:13,770 --> 02:06:16,300
endorses and Japanese necktie.
And then,

2978
02:06:16,340 --> 02:06:17,080
and then,
uh,

2979
02:06:17,140 --> 02:06:20,380
my killer brand and Travis Travis 
Micheala.

2980
02:06:20,570 --> 02:06:22,930
Yeah.
Some crazy stuff.

2981
02:06:22,940 --> 02:06:23,150
And

2982
02:06:23,150 --> 02:06:24,560
by the way,
if you're in San Francisco,

2983
02:06:24,561 --> 02:06:25,910
Danny,
how did they find your place?

2984
02:06:26,610 --> 02:06:28,840
A lot of people already come to your 
place because the podcasts,

2985
02:06:28,841 --> 02:06:29,300
right?
Yes,

2986
02:06:29,301 --> 02:06:29,960
yes,
yes.

2987
02:06:29,961 --> 02:06:32,540
The year a podcast has helped me.
Thank you very much.

2988
02:06:32,870 --> 02:06:34,010
How do they,
how do they get their,

2989
02:06:34,640 --> 02:06:35,180
uh,
were,

2990
02:06:35,181 --> 02:06:36,110
uh,
on,

2991
02:06:36,140 --> 02:06:36,530
uh,
through,

2992
02:06:36,531 --> 02:06:37,520
through,
through Valencia street,

2993
02:06:37,521 --> 02:06:40,100
suite 100 inside Valencia street muscle,
the gym.

2994
02:06:40,430 --> 02:06:44,780
And my website is 10th Planet Jiu Jitsu 
SF.com.

2995
02:06:44,930 --> 02:06:46,270
And for folks who,
you know,

2996
02:06:46,280 --> 02:06:46,720
look,
look,

2997
02:06:46,760 --> 02:06:51,760
I get emails,
I get twitter messages all the time 

2998
02:06:51,760 --> 02:06:51,760
saying,
thank you.

2999
02:06:51,760 --> 02:06:52,220
I started doing Jujitsu because of the 
podcast.

3000
02:06:52,280 --> 02:06:53,990
For people who think you can't do it,
if your,

3001
02:06:53,991 --> 02:06:55,760
if your body,
your body works,

3002
02:06:55,790 --> 02:06:56,840
you can do it.
All right?

3003
02:06:57,020 --> 02:06:58,550
You don't have to go in there and jump 
in.

3004
02:06:58,551 --> 02:07:00,470
They were killers.
You take beginning classes,

3005
02:07:00,471 --> 02:07:02,690
you learn some technique.
And it's fun.

3006
02:07:02,930 --> 02:07:04,250
When the Indian,
you know what man,

3007
02:07:04,251 --> 02:07:06,200
you just gotta you gotta be able to be 
tapped out.

3008
02:07:06,201 --> 02:07:07,820
When you get tapped out,
just tap,

3009
02:07:07,821 --> 02:07:10,940
just tap and go right back in and figure
out what you did wrong and learn.

3010
02:07:10,970 --> 02:07:14,210
And it is a vehicle for developing your 
whole life.

3011
02:07:14,480 --> 02:07:18,230
All martial arts are yield there.
When you get through difficult things,

3012
02:07:18,350 --> 02:07:20,630
a lot of people never physically get 
pushed.

3013
02:07:20,690 --> 02:07:25,690
They don't.
They don't understand what it feels 

3014
02:07:25,690 --> 02:07:25,690
like.
They don't understand what it's like to,

3015
02:07:25,690 --> 02:07:25,690
to.
To,

3016
02:07:25,690 --> 02:07:29,240
to really exert yourself and to try hard
into grow and accomplish.

3017
02:07:29,500 --> 02:07:30,750
To accomplish,
you know,

3018
02:07:30,770 --> 02:07:35,770
something.
To learn some new techniques to develop 

3019
02:07:35,770 --> 02:07:35,830
an advance.
It's so important for that you do.

3020
02:07:35,980 --> 02:07:38,470
When you get really good at something as
difficult as Jujitsu,

3021
02:07:38,620 --> 02:07:42,220
it makes everything in your life better.
And when we say anybody can do it,

3022
02:07:42,221 --> 02:07:45,160
anybody that's not a sales pitch,
anybody can do it.

3023
02:07:45,370 --> 02:07:47,020
Girl,
little girls,

3024
02:07:47,021 --> 02:07:51,160
little five year old,
six year old girls do Jujitsu,

3025
02:07:51,640 --> 02:07:55,360
old ladies do Jujitsu.
Anybody can do it.

3026
02:07:55,390 --> 02:07:58,150
You know,
know contrary to popular belief,

3027
02:07:58,300 --> 02:08:02,980
you go to Jujitsu school,
it's not these barbaric animals that are

3028
02:08:02,981 --> 02:08:07,660
want to rip your arm off.
It's the opposite because the nerds.

3029
02:08:07,720 --> 02:08:09,200
Yeah,
it's mostly classes.

3030
02:08:09,210 --> 02:08:11,020
I'm also the computer nerds who will 
kill you.

3031
02:08:11,110 --> 02:08:11,830
Yeah,
exactly.

3032
02:08:11,900 --> 02:08:13,840
Computer nerds that are addicted to 
gaming.

3033
02:08:13,870 --> 02:08:15,940
Like cade,
like if you didn't know Kate,

3034
02:08:15,980 --> 02:08:20,120
you know cade cade Nelson,
who's wicked is Jujitsu,

3035
02:08:20,121 --> 02:08:23,620
is wicked and he's a very small guy.
He's like 140 pounds at the most,

3036
02:08:23,621 --> 02:08:24,430
right?
He's not on.

3037
02:08:24,810 --> 02:08:28,660
He's won 30 black belt,
nasty technique,

3038
02:08:28,720 --> 02:08:30,240
nasty technique,
but if you look at him,

3039
02:08:30,260 --> 02:08:33,010
he's like all skin and bones Mazda,
the nicest guy.

3040
02:08:33,010 --> 02:08:34,450
Nicest guy.
You know,

3041
02:08:34,451 --> 02:08:39,451
it's,
it's totally not a bunch of killers who 

3042
02:08:39,451 --> 02:08:40,900
just literally,
yes,

3043
02:08:40,930 --> 02:08:41,910
you learn Jujitsu.
You,

3044
02:08:41,940 --> 02:08:45,010
you are learning how to kill people,
but they're not animals.

3045
02:08:45,050 --> 02:08:46,770
Not mean people.
They're like,

3046
02:08:46,950 --> 02:08:48,970
like really cool,
nice folks.

3047
02:08:48,971 --> 02:08:50,260
You know,
like so many of them,

3048
02:08:50,290 --> 02:08:51,340
like Brent,
you know,

3049
02:08:51,341 --> 02:08:53,350
you look at brand,
like what a nice looking guy.

3050
02:08:53,410 --> 02:08:57,040
He seems like a real friendly,
nice to everybody.

3051
02:08:57,380 --> 02:08:59,650
Check your fucking lights.
The sport itself,

3052
02:09:00,040 --> 02:09:00,880
what it,
what,

3053
02:09:00,970 --> 02:09:05,970
what's going on?
What makes it so much fun is a filter 

3054
02:09:05,970 --> 02:09:07,320
for douchebags because in the sport of 
Jujitsu,

3055
02:09:07,470 --> 02:09:09,490
you're good.
The sport is.

3056
02:09:09,520 --> 02:09:12,940
The game plan is to tap someone out to 
put someone in a position,

3057
02:09:13,090 --> 02:09:16,030
in a choke hold or an arm bar.
None of it,

3058
02:09:16,031 --> 02:09:17,230
which I did.
None of it hurts.

3059
02:09:17,231 --> 02:09:20,770
You just tap out when you feel like you 
can't get out and you tap out,

3060
02:09:20,800 --> 02:09:21,730
give up,
and then the guy,

3061
02:09:21,731 --> 02:09:22,390
let's go the whole.

3062
02:09:22,390 --> 02:09:24,310
So that's like a kill for you.
No one got hurt,

3063
02:09:24,490 --> 02:09:29,490
but you're tapped out.
You couldn't get out if you douchebags 

3064
02:09:29,490 --> 02:09:31,480
can't go,
can't walk through the fire.

3065
02:09:31,481 --> 02:09:33,490
Those beginning stages where they're 
getting tapped out,

3066
02:09:33,491 --> 02:09:36,670
they're losing the game because they 
take it too personally.

3067
02:09:36,700 --> 02:09:40,480
Everybody has an ego,
but Douche bags have the biggest egos so

3068
02:09:40,481 --> 02:09:45,481
they can't go into Jujitsu and and go 
through the learning phases where 

3069
02:09:45,481 --> 02:09:47,650
they're losing or they're tapping out,
losing a game of death.

3070
02:09:47,950 --> 02:09:49,060
You know,
they can't handle it,

3071
02:09:49,061 --> 02:09:54,061
so they never even get to Jujitsu.
The only guys that make it through are 

3072
02:09:54,061 --> 02:09:57,841
the guys that have a complete control of
their ego where they tap out at the 

3073
02:09:57,841 --> 02:09:58,240
beginning all the time.
You're always losing in the beginning,

3074
02:09:58,241 --> 02:09:59,920
you're just tapping out.
It doesn't hurt.

3075
02:10:00,010 --> 02:10:05,010
You're tapping out,
but your ego can get bruised if you 

3076
02:10:05,010 --> 02:10:05,010
don't have control of it.

3077
02:10:05,080 --> 02:10:10,080
So what ends up happening is Jujitsu is,
is the ultimate douche bag filter.

3078
02:10:10,091 --> 02:10:15,091
You're left with a bunch of guys that 
were had no problem tapping out and no 

3079
02:10:15,091 --> 02:10:19,651
problem submitting,
no problem dealing with reality because 

3080
02:10:19,651 --> 02:10:21,490
the reality is every dickhead wants to 
think that he's the full command.

3081
02:10:21,610 --> 02:10:23,020
Every guy wants to think that,
you know,

3082
02:10:23,021 --> 02:10:25,600
there's so many guys,
like if I got into m and a,

3083
02:10:25,780 --> 02:10:27,910
I'm telling you where it now I'm not 
ended at MMA,

3084
02:10:27,911 --> 02:10:30,490
but if I get a new fucking be running 
shit,

3085
02:10:30,910 --> 02:10:34,280
fuck GSP,
I'm a natural born fighter to some

3086
02:10:34,280 --> 02:10:36,260
dudes are just natural.
And those guys,

3087
02:10:36,261 --> 02:10:41,261
they can't handle Jujitsu because some 
little cade dude will choke their 

3088
02:10:41,261 --> 02:10:41,450
fucking lights out,
you know?

3089
02:10:41,451 --> 02:10:46,451
And that's also one of those guys are 
scared of weed hollow as especially 

3090
02:10:46,451 --> 02:10:46,490
edibles,
edibles.

3091
02:10:46,491 --> 02:10:48,800
Expose your douchey ness as well.
Meanwhile,

3092
02:10:48,830 --> 02:10:51,330
edibles are the best things to roll on.
Ooh,

3093
02:10:51,560 --> 02:10:55,000
I don't like cookie.
Realize you just never know how much thc

3094
02:10:55,001 --> 02:11:00,001
are getting into.
We talked about before with lately I've 

3095
02:11:00,231 --> 02:11:02,480
been on,
but on a good roll with these trips,

3096
02:11:03,340 --> 02:11:06,460
I decided a couple couple of pumps for 
teaching.

3097
02:11:07,000 --> 02:11:08,480
I'm all good.
I don't need to get crazy.

3098
02:11:08,481 --> 02:11:10,850
You guys ever tried the cold list?
No.

3099
02:11:10,980 --> 02:11:13,520
Dot It's a.
it's like a breath thing.

3100
02:11:13,550 --> 02:11:14,930
You tried it.
That was it.

3101
02:11:15,120 --> 02:11:15,690
Pretty good.
Yeah.

3102
02:11:15,990 --> 02:11:17,390
Yeah.
It's amazing.

3103
02:11:17,570 --> 02:11:22,570
But eventually they're gonna have like 
fucking filtration systems and air 

3104
02:11:22,570 --> 02:11:26,561
conditioning.
When you come into you come into work 

3105
02:11:26,561 --> 02:11:26,561
and just get high.

3106
02:11:26,561 --> 02:11:26,561
What about the new vapor pens?
What does that.

3107
02:11:26,561 --> 02:11:27,800
Oh,
the like old school.

3108
02:11:27,801 --> 02:11:30,410
Like they look like those magic.
The cigarette.

3109
02:11:30,411 --> 02:11:31,130
Yeah.
The cigarettes.

3110
02:11:31,160 --> 02:11:32,210
Electronic cigarettes.
Yeah.

3111
02:11:32,240 --> 02:11:37,240
Yeah.
They're like soaked in thc and there's 

3112
02:11:37,240 --> 02:11:38,940
zero smell.
Don't just approach and talk about that 

3113
02:11:38,940 --> 02:11:40,040
because someday you're gonna want to use
those in someplace.

3114
02:11:40,610 --> 02:11:43,100
Meanwhile they're monitoring twitter.
These cons.

3115
02:11:43,130 --> 02:11:43,730
Yeah.
We used to.

3116
02:11:44,000 --> 02:11:48,380
I used to have the electronic wines,
but they weren't accurate.

3117
02:11:48,381 --> 02:11:49,460
You know,
like it seemed like you weren't.

3118
02:11:49,461 --> 02:11:51,110
You just suck on him for awhile and 
you're like,

3119
02:11:51,111 --> 02:11:52,770
I'm not getting anything.
This is bullshit.

3120
02:11:52,771 --> 02:11:54,330
It's eventually.
It's all gonna.

3121
02:11:54,331 --> 02:11:55,110
Be Legal.
We're,

3122
02:11:55,120 --> 02:11:56,660
we're,
we're battling at right now.

3123
02:11:56,780 --> 02:11:59,090
Here's some crazy shit that was on 
MSNBC,

3124
02:11:59,120 --> 02:12:03,050
MSNBC DOT com.
It's for royders in London.

3125
02:12:03,080 --> 02:12:08,080
These scientists did these studies on 
people tripping on mash magic mushrooms 

3126
02:12:08,080 --> 02:12:11,860
and they.
It's given them the best picture yet of 

3127
02:12:11,860 --> 02:12:14,231
how psychedelic drugs work,
and these British scientists are saying 

3128
02:12:14,231 --> 02:12:16,220
the findings suggest that such drugs 
could be used to treat depression.

3129
02:12:16,280 --> 02:12:17,270
Absolutely.
Yeah.

3130
02:12:17,271 --> 02:12:18,550
I mean it's amazing.
This is not.

3131
02:12:18,650 --> 02:12:23,650
This is all becoming mainstream shit.
One after the other over and over and 

3132
02:12:23,650 --> 02:12:24,230
over again.
There's these studies that are coming to

3133
02:12:24,231 --> 02:12:27,650
light now that are suggesting that all 
these different drugs,

3134
02:12:27,800 --> 02:12:32,800
ketamine,
they're seeing the ketamine can be used 

3135
02:12:32,800 --> 02:12:33,680
as an instant cure for depression and 
one of the reasons why kids get addicted

3136
02:12:33,681 --> 02:12:38,681
to ketamine is the first thing that 
ketamine does alleviate all your 

3137
02:12:38,681 --> 02:12:41,381
worries,
like does one of the reasons why people 

3138
02:12:41,381 --> 02:12:43,691
are doing it so that other suggesting 
that ketamine can be used as some sort 

3139
02:12:43,691 --> 02:12:46,781
of an antidepressant,
as some sort of an instant 

3140
02:12:46,781 --> 02:12:47,050
antidepressant quality,
as well as suicide.

3141
02:12:47,051 --> 02:12:49,640
On two separate studies,
the effects of Psilocybin,

3142
02:12:49,641 --> 02:12:53,690
the active ingredient in magic mushrooms
showed that contrary to scientists,

3143
02:12:54,060 --> 02:12:57,830
scientists expectations,
which of course is based on propaganda.

3144
02:12:58,010 --> 02:13:03,010
It does not increase but rather suppress
activity in areas of the brain that are 

3145
02:13:03,010 --> 02:13:05,720
also dampened with other antidepressant 
treatments,

3146
02:13:05,780 --> 02:13:10,780
so they don't even understand it.
It's like they're saying psychedelics 

3147
02:13:10,780 --> 02:13:14,471
are thought of as mind expanding drugs,
so it's been assume that they work by 

3148
02:13:14,471 --> 02:13:15,680
increasing the brain's activity,
but they don't.

3149
02:13:16,400 --> 02:13:17,530
Surprisingly,
they found this.

3150
02:13:17,730 --> 02:13:22,730
Psilocybin actually causes the activity 
to decrease in areas that have the 

3151
02:13:22,730 --> 02:13:24,150
dentist connections with other areas so 
they don't know.

3152
02:13:24,770 --> 02:13:29,770
That makes sense though,
so it quiets your brain down so you 

3153
02:13:29,770 --> 02:13:31,260
could have an outer body experience.
That makes sense to me.

3154
02:13:31,290 --> 02:13:31,630
Sort of

3155
02:13:32,010 --> 02:13:33,930
less activity,
less activity.

3156
02:13:34,050 --> 02:13:36,090
Just like when you meditate,
you meditate,

3157
02:13:36,380 --> 02:13:38,730
you know people are addicted to 
meditation because you know,

3158
02:13:38,731 --> 02:13:40,210
if you could,
if you could just think,

3159
02:13:40,620 --> 02:13:43,290
think about one thought,
like a water drop or whatever.

3160
02:13:43,291 --> 02:13:44,960
You get into that zone.
People,

3161
02:13:45,570 --> 02:13:48,660
that zone is the frequency of the 
universe.

3162
02:13:48,661 --> 02:13:51,330
That's where everyone's trying to get.
They're trying to get that and you do it

3163
02:13:51,331 --> 02:13:53,730
by just thinking about one thing,
so that makes sense.

3164
02:13:53,731 --> 02:13:57,660
You're quieting your brain,
removing all negativity.

3165
02:13:57,750 --> 02:14:01,710
You're thinking about one thing and it 
aligns you with the universe.

3166
02:14:01,711 --> 02:14:03,330
I mean,
maybe you know,

3167
02:14:03,390 --> 02:14:05,130
no one knows exactly what it's doing.
I mean,

3168
02:14:05,131 --> 02:14:08,250
it might just be facilitating evolution.
It might just be giving you a better way

3169
02:14:08,251 --> 02:14:13,251
of thinking because that's my hypothesis
because the free the universe is at one 

3170
02:14:13,251 --> 02:14:18,231
frequency that science.
So it makes sense that we should try to 

3171
02:14:18,231 --> 02:14:18,240
get to that frequency.

3172
02:14:18,240 --> 02:14:23,240
If the universe is at a frequency,
one frequency all throughout the 

3173
02:14:23,240 --> 02:14:23,240
universe,
we know that.

3174
02:14:23,240 --> 02:14:24,490
It makes sense.
What do you mean by that?

3175
02:14:24,540 --> 02:14:26,290
What's his frequency?
You're talking about it.

3176
02:14:26,430 --> 02:14:29,760
The whole universe is at a frequency,
like one frequency,

3177
02:14:29,761 --> 02:14:34,680
and that was in the debate between a 
creationism and evolution.

3178
02:14:34,681 --> 02:14:35,910
That was the strong point,
right?

3179
02:14:35,911 --> 02:14:39,930
There's a science proved that the whole 
universe at one frequency.

3180
02:14:40,050 --> 02:14:41,640
So the creationists are saying,
see,

3181
02:14:41,641 --> 02:14:44,100
that's proof of God.
That's proof of intelligent design.

3182
02:14:44,190 --> 02:14:49,190
How could the whole universe by accident
be at one frequency frequency mean 

3183
02:14:49,351 --> 02:14:50,910
though?
Um,

3184
02:14:51,090 --> 02:14:54,270
I don't know exactly,
but it's like the frequency.

3185
02:14:54,590 --> 02:14:56,430
What is the frequency of smoking,
man?

3186
02:14:56,790 --> 02:14:58,380
Yeah,
that shit is so gross,

3187
02:14:58,381 --> 02:14:59,640
dude.
God Damn.

3188
02:14:59,700 --> 02:15:03,060
Or they put a fan on or something,
but the frequency is like,

3189
02:15:03,061 --> 02:15:06,330
like what's a frequency of vibration?
It's a vibration vibration.

3190
02:15:06,540 --> 02:15:07,980
Frequency of cigarettes give off.

3191
02:15:09,030 --> 02:15:14,030
Dude,
that's fucking calm for 93 point four 

3192
02:15:14,030 --> 02:15:17,480
brands for real man.
Unless you've got a window open or 

3193
02:15:17,480 --> 02:15:17,480
something,
you got to send a smoke sucker.

3194
02:15:17,500 --> 02:15:18,970
Shit ain't doing nothing,
man.

3195
02:15:19,440 --> 02:15:21,300
Know what I mean by that?
Like what's a frequency?

3196
02:15:21,301 --> 02:15:23,400
And it like a radio station is a certain
frequency.

3197
02:15:23,401 --> 02:15:25,620
It's a 95 point five.
What is that like?

3198
02:15:25,790 --> 02:15:30,790
Well,
you know what's a frequency and if you 

3199
02:15:30,790 --> 02:15:30,790
turn that dial,
Bam,

3200
02:15:30,790 --> 02:15:32,040
you need to get that frequency on 95 
point five.

3201
02:15:32,041 --> 02:15:33,240
If you were listening to Kayla.
Yes.

3202
02:15:33,390 --> 02:15:38,390
So the pinnacle of science is that they 
just discovered that the whole universe 

3203
02:15:39,210 --> 02:15:41,520
is one frequency.
I don't know what number that is,

3204
02:15:41,760 --> 02:15:46,760
but it's a certain frequency in music.
You got to be on the same frequency or 

3205
02:15:46,760 --> 02:15:49,260
you got to be on frequencies that 
harmonize with that frequency.

3206
02:15:49,440 --> 02:15:51,000
So it makes sense.
Like to me,

3207
02:15:51,001 --> 02:15:53,100
it makes sense that if the whole unit 
so,

3208
02:15:53,101 --> 02:15:54,480
but,
but the scientist saying,

3209
02:15:54,690 --> 02:15:59,690
no,
it doesn't prove intelligent design 

3210
02:15:59,690 --> 02:16:01,881
because we are finding that we're not in
just one universe where there's a 

3211
02:16:01,881 --> 02:16:01,881
multiverse,
there's,

3212
02:16:01,920 --> 02:16:06,510
there's endless universes that each one 
is at a different frequency,

3213
02:16:06,511 --> 02:16:08,550
so that has improved any intelligent 
design.

3214
02:16:09,060 --> 02:16:10,800
I don't really give a shit about that 
argument,

3215
02:16:10,920 --> 02:16:15,920
but to me it makes sense.
We're trying to get to add on the 

3216
02:16:15,920 --> 02:16:20,031
frequency of the universe and that makes
sense to you because I have no idea 

3217
02:16:20,031 --> 02:16:21,870
still and I'm like trying to get on the 
radio station of the universe.

3218
02:16:21,950 --> 02:16:24,410
That's,
that's another had meditation and Yoga.

3219
02:16:24,450 --> 02:16:26,430
This is my hypothesis is what?
This is what I'm.

3220
02:16:26,610 --> 02:16:29,830
This is my guess is that Yoga and 
meditation,

3221
02:16:30,040 --> 02:16:35,040
unconditional love sex.
Certain drugs will get you in the 

3222
02:16:35,040 --> 02:16:38,530
frequency if you love the man.
What about dog sex?

3223
02:16:38,531 --> 02:16:40,710
What about you fucking donkey?
It's the same frequency.

3224
02:16:40,711 --> 02:16:45,711
Is it the same frequency animals?
I'm saying the only thing that I'm 

3225
02:16:45,711 --> 02:16:47,920
seeing here is from God like 
productions,

3226
02:16:47,921 --> 02:16:50,500
which right away you go,
okay.

3227
02:16:50,980 --> 02:16:52,450
What they're saying is that all

3228
02:16:52,530 --> 02:16:57,530
beings in the universe connect through a
single frequency and there's a bunch of 

3229
02:16:57,530 --> 02:17:00,831
videos I guess you have to watch to,
to understand where they're trying to 

3230
02:17:00,831 --> 02:17:00,831
say.

3231
02:17:00,831 --> 02:17:00,920
Yeah,
makes sense to me.

3232
02:17:01,190 --> 02:17:05,870
I looked tense and it says it's a song 
from the butthole surfers.

3233
02:17:05,960 --> 02:17:08,240
Really bad.
It's a good song.

3234
02:17:08,290 --> 02:17:11,390
Yeah.
I mean,

3235
02:17:11,600 --> 02:17:12,270
no one knows what

3236
02:17:12,290 --> 02:17:13,790
the fuck is going on when you were on 
mushrooms.

3237
02:17:13,791 --> 02:17:18,791
It's,
it's certainly something that should be 

3238
02:17:18,791 --> 02:17:18,791
studied though.
And that's what I think is missing in,

3239
02:17:18,791 --> 02:17:18,791
in,
you know,

3240
02:17:18,791 --> 02:17:23,680
and people's ideas of mushrooms.
Everybody's got this propaganda based 

3241
02:17:23,680 --> 02:17:24,710
opinion on it.
Everybody thinks it's bad for you.

3242
02:17:24,711 --> 02:17:25,150
I mean,
I'm,

3243
02:17:25,151 --> 02:17:30,151
I remember I had this conversation with 
Michio Kaku wants when we're on the 

3244
02:17:30,151 --> 02:17:30,550
opiod anthony show and I suggested a,
you know,

3245
02:17:30,610 --> 02:17:32,690
I asked him if he's ever done mushrooms 
and you know,

3246
02:17:32,691 --> 02:17:34,340
he asked like I said like,
Hey,

3247
02:17:34,341 --> 02:17:35,300
you know,
you ever,

3248
02:17:35,390 --> 02:17:37,610
you ever smoke crack?
You ever do math?

3249
02:17:37,670 --> 02:17:38,210
You know,
it's like,

3250
02:17:38,500 --> 02:17:40,040
to a lot of people that's like the same 
thing.

3251
02:17:40,041 --> 02:17:41,990
Like you say,
do mushrooms and they don't want to mess

3252
02:17:41,991 --> 02:17:44,240
up their brain,
but so much insight,

3253
02:17:44,241 --> 02:17:49,241
so many different people have come up 
with insights because directly related 

3254
02:17:49,241 --> 02:17:49,910
to psychedelic experiments,
and I don't know if it's true,

3255
02:17:49,911 --> 02:17:52,820
but the rumor was that Francis Crick,
when he,

3256
02:17:52,850 --> 02:17:57,850
when he was dying,
admitted that he was a frequent user of 

3257
02:17:57,850 --> 02:17:59,360
lsd and then that's how he came up with 
the idea,

3258
02:17:59,370 --> 02:18:02,210
the concept of the double helix of DNA,
you know,

3259
02:18:02,211 --> 02:18:07,211
that he came up with and under the 
influence of the LSD has been an up a 

3260
02:18:07,211 --> 02:18:07,211
bunch of this.

3261
02:18:07,211 --> 02:18:11,560
I think the guy's name was carrie.
Another guy came up with other insights 

3262
02:18:11,560 --> 02:18:14,951
on LSD and it's been geneticists and 
different people that have done Iowasca 

3263
02:18:14,951 --> 02:18:18,821
that have had weird ideas and expand on 
these ideas that came directly as a 

3264
02:18:18,821 --> 02:18:21,470
result of psychedelic experiences.
Who knows what it is,

3265
02:18:21,471 --> 02:18:22,520
man?
I don't know,

3266
02:18:22,521 --> 02:18:24,740
but it would be awesome if they were 
allowed people to fuck it,

3267
02:18:24,741 --> 02:18:29,741
study it instead of locked you in a 
fucking cage for experiencing something 

3268
02:18:29,741 --> 02:18:30,950
that's been here a lot longer than 
people have.

3269
02:18:31,220 --> 02:18:32,570
You know,
so stupid.

3270
02:18:32,940 --> 02:18:34,910
It's just we have a bunch of stupid 
people,

3271
02:18:35,060 --> 02:18:36,950
like we were talking before,
this happened about,

3272
02:18:36,951 --> 02:18:39,860
uh,
the presidential debates about watching,

3273
02:18:40,210 --> 02:18:42,730
like watching Newt Gingrich is 
hilarious.

3274
02:18:42,731 --> 02:18:46,900
Like how is he even even in the 
presidential race,

3275
02:18:46,901 --> 02:18:51,901
I mean that you're saying that guy 
doesn't rob him and Mitt Romney are 

3276
02:18:52,211 --> 02:18:57,190
arguing about because they both had an 
investments in some,

3277
02:18:57,250 --> 02:18:58,090
some,
uh,

3278
02:18:58,180 --> 02:19:02,680
they both made money off the economy 
going to shit based on their investments

3279
02:19:03,190 --> 02:19:06,250
and they both did,
but there were arguing live on tv,

3280
02:19:06,251 --> 02:19:11,251
on CNN about who invested more and that 
that alone should tell people that are 

3281
02:19:12,911 --> 02:19:14,990
both full of shit.
Well,

3282
02:19:15,130 --> 02:19:18,590
he just lost the Kim and second place in
Florida new.

3283
02:19:18,670 --> 02:19:20,740
Can you imagine if Newt Gingrich's,
the president,

3284
02:19:21,100 --> 02:19:26,100
Mitt Romney,
Mitt Romney met with a kid who had 

3285
02:19:26,100 --> 02:19:27,950
cerebral palsy and he marijuana

3286
02:19:28,300 --> 02:19:30,980
would say,
why don't you wouldn't even answer him.

3287
02:19:31,010 --> 02:19:31,910
He wouldn't even answer.
You said,

3288
02:19:31,911 --> 02:19:32,600
what?
You put me in jail.

3289
02:19:32,601 --> 02:19:33,080
He said,
well,

3290
02:19:33,110 --> 02:19:35,630
you could try synthetic marijuana 
synthetic.

3291
02:19:35,631 --> 02:19:40,631
Marilyn.
He was suggesting that that was a good 

3292
02:19:40,631 --> 02:19:41,720
idea that I'm not for medical marijuana.
I've told you I'm not for it.

3293
02:19:41,900 --> 02:19:43,930
Like you're not for it,
you're telling for why,

3294
02:19:43,931 --> 02:19:45,140
why?
For what reason?

3295
02:19:45,170 --> 02:19:46,190
Under what reason.
Why?

3296
02:19:46,191 --> 02:19:50,360
Because you're a whore because all these
goddamn companies that gets you into the

3297
02:19:50,361 --> 02:19:55,361
position that you're in right now tell 
you that that's the stance that you 

3298
02:19:55,361 --> 02:19:56,870
should take.
See that video of Mitt Romney's flipping

3299
02:19:56,871 --> 02:20:00,860
and flopping.
There's an awesome a mormon man.

3300
02:20:01,070 --> 02:20:02,990
Not that there's anything wrong with 
being a mormon,

3301
02:20:02,991 --> 02:20:07,991
but when you're a mormon,
you're not allowed to run the 

3302
02:20:07,991 --> 02:20:07,991
presidency.
You're not around the run the country.

3303
02:20:07,991 --> 02:20:12,221
You're just not.
You're not allowed to any wacky 

3304
02:20:12,221 --> 02:20:12,221
religion.

3305
02:20:12,221 --> 02:20:15,670
If you're a super catholic,
and I know jfk was a Catholic and 

3306
02:20:15,670 --> 02:20:15,670
everything like that,
but this is with different times.

3307
02:20:15,670 --> 02:20:17,630
It's 2012.
You know?

3308
02:20:17,631 --> 02:20:19,400
Really,
you believe that Joseph Smith,

3309
02:20:19,401 --> 02:20:23,510
a 14 year old kid that lived in 18,
20 pound golden tablets that represented

3310
02:20:23,511 --> 02:20:26,180
the last work of Jesus.
The guy was a con man,

3311
02:20:26,181 --> 02:20:31,181
unknown con man.
He said he found a stone and the secret 

3312
02:20:31,181 --> 02:20:33,560
stone and he looked through the stone 
and he could read the large works.

3313
02:20:33,650 --> 02:20:37,070
Jesus really,
really come on,

3314
02:20:37,071 --> 02:20:39,520
man,
which was that in a goof ball.

3315
02:20:40,840 --> 02:20:42,740
It's just,
it's just fucking amazing,

3316
02:20:42,770 --> 02:20:43,430
man.
You know,

3317
02:20:43,431 --> 02:20:46,820
I have friends that are friends of 
friends actually that are Mormons that I

3318
02:20:46,821 --> 02:20:48,080
know.
They're very nice people.

3319
02:20:48,081 --> 02:20:53,081
It's one of the nicest religions and 
what it gives them that's great is a 

3320
02:20:53,081 --> 02:20:57,131
great sense of community like they have.
Their churches have been a mormon 

3321
02:20:57,131 --> 02:20:57,131
churches before.

3322
02:20:57,131 --> 02:20:58,220
They have a really nice sense of 
community.

3323
02:20:58,221 --> 02:21:01,730
They're very nice to each other and they
really promote that they're promote like

3324
02:21:01,850 --> 02:21:05,560
that feeling of family and that positive
frequency and it does really.

3325
02:21:05,600 --> 02:21:07,310
It really makes a difference.
Man,

3326
02:21:07,311 --> 02:21:08,090
you know,
I,

3327
02:21:08,091 --> 02:21:10,880
I was at a mormon funeral recently and 
these people,

3328
02:21:10,881 --> 02:21:15,881
man,
they really believed that this guy was 

3329
02:21:15,881 --> 02:21:17,621
in a better place and it really helped 
them that their loved one had passed on 

3330
02:21:17,621 --> 02:21:18,650
into a better place.
It really did and I and I,

3331
02:21:18,651 --> 02:21:20,450
I really support that.
I think that's awesome,

3332
02:21:20,990 --> 02:21:25,990
but just just that's just because the 
ideology happens to be in a good 

3333
02:21:25,990 --> 02:21:30,071
frequency,
but if you break down what the ideology 

3334
02:21:30,071 --> 02:21:30,071
stands for,
it's ludicrous.

3335
02:21:30,071 --> 02:21:31,700
It's absolutely ridiculous.
It's absolutely doing some good for some

3336
02:21:31,701 --> 02:21:34,670
of these people,
but so would just being nice,

3337
02:21:34,850 --> 02:21:39,850
it would do the exact same thing,
so we'll just being humble and giving 

3338
02:21:39,850 --> 02:21:39,940
into love and just being nice to people.

3339
02:21:40,080 --> 02:21:43,790
You don't need some wacky shit that was 
made by a con man,

3340
02:21:43,791 --> 02:21:48,590
a 14 year old con man who found golden 
tablets and then when the people came to

3341
02:21:48,591 --> 02:21:49,670
him like,
where are these tablets?

3342
02:21:49,671 --> 02:21:54,170
He was older angels took them away.
Angels took.

3343
02:21:54,320 --> 02:21:55,670
It's like,
it's like,

3344
02:21:55,671 --> 02:21:57,830
you know,
it's such a dumb story.

3345
02:21:57,850 --> 02:21:59,760
It's a terrible story.
Yeah.

3346
02:22:00,260 --> 02:22:01,160
I mean,
to me,

3347
02:22:01,161 --> 02:22:04,280
I growing up,
I despised all religions.

3348
02:22:04,281 --> 02:22:08,960
I thought I thought it was all just crap
and destroying society,

3349
02:22:08,961 --> 02:22:11,240
but as I get older,
I,

3350
02:22:11,450 --> 02:22:13,660
for me,
my opinion on religions,

3351
02:22:13,760 --> 02:22:18,760
if you do it right,
if it's based on unconditional love and 

3352
02:22:18,760 --> 02:22:20,300
doing the right thing,
different religions are just like.

3353
02:22:20,580 --> 02:22:24,150
It's a way to get your soul and the 
right frequency.

3354
02:22:24,300 --> 02:22:26,160
There's different ways.
Get your body physically,

3355
02:22:26,160 --> 02:22:28,800
like there's kettlebells and then 
there's some people like to just run.

3356
02:22:28,801 --> 02:22:33,801
Some people like to swim,
all different ways to get your body 

3357
02:22:33,801 --> 02:22:34,290
align,
and I think all religions,

3358
02:22:34,291 --> 02:22:37,070
as long as you do it right,
whether it's Muslim or whatever,

3359
02:22:37,080 --> 02:22:38,040
cat,
Catholicism,

3360
02:22:38,041 --> 02:22:39,340
like my grandma,
she did it right.

3361
02:22:39,480 --> 02:22:43,920
All she cared about was doing things for
others and she was hardcore Catholic.

3362
02:22:43,921 --> 02:22:47,400
Went to church every day.
That was per exercise of the soul.

3363
02:22:47,670 --> 02:22:50,310
That is what got her frequency in the 
right place.

3364
02:22:50,400 --> 02:22:53,250
Some people do yoga,
some people meditate.

3365
02:22:53,340 --> 02:22:55,170
Some people you know,
believe this.

3366
02:22:55,171 --> 02:23:00,171
Some people worship rocks.
If you really believe rock the rock is 

3367
02:23:00,171 --> 02:23:01,650
the frequency of the universe and it 
gets your soul in the right place.

3368
02:23:01,940 --> 02:23:02,910
Um,
I'm all for it.

3369
02:23:03,600 --> 02:23:08,600
It's an idea of just believing in 
something and then having a code that 

3370
02:23:08,600 --> 02:23:12,630
you live by and moving your life always 
in a positive way,

3371
02:23:12,950 --> 02:23:14,900
and that's good.
No matter what you call it.

3372
02:23:14,901 --> 02:23:18,110
What do you call it?
Hindu do you call it Kundalini Yoga,

3373
02:23:18,111 --> 02:23:23,111
where you call it Catholicism.
If you're really moving in a positive 

3374
02:23:23,111 --> 02:23:27,011
direction and you really believe in love
and you really are being warm and open 

3375
02:23:27,201 --> 02:23:32,201
and you've given the idea of giving into
a higher power is not because God wants 

3376
02:23:32,201 --> 02:23:35,330
you to be humble where God wants you to 
be in all of his greatness.

3377
02:23:35,440 --> 02:23:36,160
What,
what it,

3378
02:23:36,260 --> 02:23:38,450
what it is is saying there's something 
above you,

3379
02:23:38,451 --> 02:23:43,451
so not taking yourself so fucking 
seriously and instead not being out for 

3380
02:23:43,451 --> 02:23:45,650
number one and sort of realizing that we
are together.

3381
02:23:45,651 --> 02:23:48,110
Like there is a brotherhood and 
sisterhood of man,

3382
02:23:48,410 --> 02:23:48,980
you know,
that's,

3383
02:23:48,981 --> 02:23:50,990
that's really what it's supposed to be 
all about.

3384
02:23:51,000 --> 02:23:53,960
That's the good of religion.
And that's where I've seen religion help

3385
02:23:53,961 --> 02:23:58,961
people for sure.
And that was just like you growing up 

3386
02:23:58,961 --> 02:24:01,631
man.
And it was both of us was the same 

3387
02:24:01,631 --> 02:24:01,760
reason because we had seen the system 
fail us.

3388
02:24:02,000 --> 02:24:07,000
You know,
we had seen all these people that were 

3389
02:24:07,000 --> 02:24:08,711
supposed to be correct and you know,
these people that were supposed to be 

3390
02:24:08,711 --> 02:24:08,711
adults.
We saw they were retarded.

3391
02:24:08,711 --> 02:24:11,180
We saw there were assholes.
We saw that was all bullshit.

3392
02:24:11,181 --> 02:24:11,880
We saw that,
you know,

3393
02:24:11,990 --> 02:24:16,990
religion was being used negatively a lot
of the time and it was a lot of guilt 

3394
02:24:16,990 --> 02:24:17,480
and there was a lot of yelling at you 
and it was a lot of.

3395
02:24:17,540 --> 02:24:19,250
So we just,
we just trashed.

3396
02:24:19,980 --> 02:24:20,150
So

3397
02:24:21,180 --> 02:24:22,380
I like,
I would never,

3398
02:24:22,440 --> 02:24:27,440
if my grandmother was still alive,
I would never try to like knock some 

3399
02:24:27,440 --> 02:24:31,010
sense into her,
try to prove that the Bible is written 

3400
02:24:31,010 --> 02:24:31,010
by Matt.
It worked for her.

3401
02:24:31,010 --> 02:24:33,330
That was her kettlebells right there for
assault.

3402
02:24:33,480 --> 02:24:35,190
It worked for like,
you know,

3403
02:24:35,460 --> 02:24:36,080
and well,
you know,

3404
02:24:36,090 --> 02:24:38,610
that's the way I look at it now.
I think religion is,

3405
02:24:38,900 --> 02:24:43,550
is if you do it right in and uh,
you're,

3406
02:24:43,560 --> 02:24:48,560
you know,
you always look to do the right thing 

3407
02:24:48,560 --> 02:24:50,720
and it's all life is all about a 
selflessness and a unconditional.

3408
02:24:53,210 --> 02:24:55,460
And what people don't understand is that
benefits your man.

3409
02:24:55,461 --> 02:24:56,420
You know,
you can be,

3410
02:24:56,460 --> 02:24:58,850
do,
do that and do it in a selfish way.

3411
02:24:58,970 --> 02:25:00,050
I mean,
it sounds stupid,

3412
02:25:00,051 --> 02:25:02,630
but if you're a selfish person,
you really want to succeed.

3413
02:25:02,631 --> 02:25:05,420
You really want good things for you.
You want to do it selfishly,

3414
02:25:05,780 --> 02:25:09,350
be nice to everybody.
That's the best way to get ahead.

3415
02:25:09,530 --> 02:25:12,560
The best way to get ahead is just be 
nice to everybody.

3416
02:25:12,561 --> 02:25:15,110
Tip people whenever you can,
tip more than you're supposed to.

3417
02:25:15,111 --> 02:25:16,400
Tip.
Give people hugs.

3418
02:25:16,401 --> 02:25:18,320
When you can be nice to people all the 
time.

3419
02:25:18,470 --> 02:25:21,740
When you put out that good energy,
you get good energy back.

3420
02:25:21,800 --> 02:25:25,810
You can like almost of it like people 
are almost looking out for number one,

3421
02:25:25,960 --> 02:25:27,490
you really want to look out for number 
one,

3422
02:25:27,550 --> 02:25:32,550
look out for everybody else.
Look out for everybody else and that's 

3423
02:25:32,550 --> 02:25:32,550
how you really look out.

3424
02:25:32,550 --> 02:25:35,940
For number one,
I have had the most benefit in my life 

3425
02:25:35,940 --> 02:25:36,580
by being nice to me,
but the most benefit in my life by being

3426
02:25:36,581 --> 02:25:41,581
generous and being friendly and being 
warm and every time I have not been 

3427
02:25:41,581 --> 02:25:44,821
that,
it's always fucked me and when I run 

3428
02:25:44,821 --> 02:25:46,831
into someone,
especially now at this stage of my life 

3429
02:25:46,831 --> 02:25:49,711
when I've had my own personal 
revelations in my own successes and 

3430
02:25:49,711 --> 02:25:51,550
failures and have kind of assessed what 
what helps me and what doesn't help me.

3431
02:25:51,880 --> 02:25:55,240
When I run into someone that's life is a
mess and I run into someone that's got a

3432
02:25:55,241 --> 02:25:56,940
lot of troubles,
God damn it.

3433
02:25:56,950 --> 02:26:00,370
If it's not a big chunk of what the fuck
got them.

3434
02:26:00,371 --> 02:26:02,380
There is the way they think about 
things,

3435
02:26:02,530 --> 02:26:07,530
the way they behave.
Think about things the way they take a 

3436
02:26:07,530 --> 02:26:07,530
cigarette.
Fucking throw it in the street.

3437
02:26:07,530 --> 02:26:12,000
You don't realize why your life is kind 
of shit while you're littering 

3438
02:26:12,000 --> 02:26:12,000
everywhere like that.

3439
02:26:12,000 --> 02:26:14,080
That's not.
You're not putting out good energy while

3440
02:26:14,081 --> 02:26:19,081
you're throwing you fucking mcdonalds 
bag out the window because no one's 

3441
02:26:19,081 --> 02:26:19,081
looking.
You're being a cunt.

3442
02:26:19,081 --> 02:26:19,940
You're fucking up man.
You're,

3443
02:26:19,941 --> 02:26:21,490
you're,
you're ruining space.

3444
02:26:21,610 --> 02:26:26,610
You're sending out bad things.
When you fuck somebody over in a 

3445
02:26:26,610 --> 02:26:26,610
business deal,
you're like,

3446
02:26:26,610 --> 02:26:26,770
well,
I profited.

3447
02:26:26,860 --> 02:26:29,110
Hey,
it's a dog eat dog world bullshit.

3448
02:26:29,230 --> 02:26:31,350
You just put out some negative shit and 
it's gonna.

3449
02:26:31,370 --> 02:26:32,440
Come back at you,
man.

3450
02:26:32,530 --> 02:26:35,860
That guy hates you because people you 
fucked over in that bad development deal

3451
02:26:35,861 --> 02:26:38,200
or whatever the hell you did wrong.
Those people don't like you.

3452
02:26:38,201 --> 02:26:39,480
Now.
They hate you and that's gonna.

3453
02:26:39,490 --> 02:26:43,600
Come your way,
do nice things and nice things come from

3454
02:26:43,601 --> 02:26:44,020
it,
man.

3455
02:26:44,670 --> 02:26:46,960
Think always.
Think,

3456
02:26:46,961 --> 02:26:51,961
talk and act man.
And that's the best way to end this 

3457
02:26:51,961 --> 02:26:51,961
bitch.
Right?

3458
02:26:51,961 --> 02:26:53,920
Let's wrap this motherfucker up.

3483
02:27:48,260 --> 02:27:52,561
Eddie puts those up there.
You just have to pay a small monthly 

3484
02:27:52,561 --> 02:27:52,561
fee.
Just like we were talking about.

3485
02:27:52,561 --> 02:27:54,430
What five perfect.
That's going to charge 30 or 25.

3486
02:27:54,431 --> 02:27:56,650
A lot of people are.
I just want just a little bit.

3487
02:27:56,710 --> 02:27:59,720
I wanted to charge for bandwidth website
gotta.

3488
02:27:59,790 --> 02:28:04,790
Charge a little bit for $99 a month for

3491
02:28:11,490 --> 02:28:13,650
Jj.com,
the book,

3492
02:28:13,680 --> 02:28:16,570
and if there's not,
if there's not a 10th planet school near

3493
02:28:16,571 --> 02:28:19,750
you,
just go to any brazilian jujitsu school,

3494
02:28:20,350 --> 02:28:21,650
any school,
it doesn't matter.

3495
02:28:21,760 --> 02:28:22,060
You know,

3496
02:28:22,120 --> 02:28:24,230
if the guy's A douche bag,
find her another school,

3497
02:28:24,231 --> 02:28:29,231
whatever,
but it's any jujitsu as better than no 

3498
02:28:29,231 --> 02:28:29,231
jujitsu.
Yeah,

3499
02:28:29,231 --> 02:28:33,171
absolutely.
It's a good thing to have the skill to 

3500
02:28:33,171 --> 02:28:35,891
protect your family,
to protect your loved ones by being an 

3501
02:28:35,891 --> 02:28:39,880
expert at scientifically subduing 
someone and putting them to sleep 

3502
02:28:39,880 --> 02:28:42,350
nonviolently and getting the hell out 
and get the safety,

3503
02:28:42,520 --> 02:28:42,880
you know.

3504
02:28:43,060 --> 02:28:44,930
And it's a fun way to exercise,
man.

3505
02:28:45,000 --> 02:28:46,360
A lot of people don't like going to the 
gym,

3506
02:28:46,361 --> 02:28:48,190
just riding a bike.
It's fucking boring,

3507
02:28:48,191 --> 02:28:53,191
you know,
and a lot of people can't motivate 

3508
02:28:53,191 --> 02:28:53,191
themselves to do that.
Jujitsu will motivate you to do it.

3509
02:28:53,191 --> 02:28:53,380
It's fun.
It's fun.

3510

There's going to be february what?

they're mixing 20 9:35.

3531

Forty nine and one slash 62.
And we're all meeting at 1:55.

3532
02:29:52,510 --> 02:29:54,400
Yeah.
That's like a mini abu dhabi dude.

3533
02:29:54,401 --> 02:29:55,750
It's,
it's not even a mini.

3534
02:29:55,751 --> 02:29:57,730
It's like just as good as apple.
Damn,

3535
02:29:57,731 --> 02:29:59,530
I'm going to be in Japan.
Oh yes.

3536
02:29:59,560 --> 02:30:01,780
Like a motherfucker.
Jake's fighting on that card.

3537
02:30:02,230 --> 02:30:02,780
Oh yeah,
he's funny.

3538
02:30:02,790 --> 02:30:05,700
Nakiyama around man.
Stand up.

3539
02:30:06,400 --> 02:30:07,150
Stand up.
Going good.

3540
02:30:07,200 --> 02:30:08,920
yeah.
Do jason was getting better man.

3541
02:30:08,921 --> 02:30:10,760
You know he's a,
you know,

3542
02:30:11,110 --> 02:30:13,180
he's a hard worker dude.
I've been working with them.

3543
02:30:13,200 --> 02:30:15,070
Uh,
I got to train with them last week.

3544
02:30:15,070 --> 02:30:20,070
dude.
He looks awesome and a stand up is 

3545
02:30:20,070 --> 02:30:20,070
getting better.
It's just getting there.

3546
02:30:20,070 --> 02:30:20,080
I think all of his skills are getting 
better.

3547
02:30:20,081 --> 02:30:21,760
His wrestling and jujitsu.
Stand up.

3548
02:30:21,761 --> 02:30:24,010
everything beautiful.
I love jake is good dude.

3549
02:30:24,330 --> 02:30:25,360
Alright,
thanks everybody.

3550
02:30:25,840 --> 02:30:28,090
Thanks to fleshlight for sponsoring the 
podcast.

3551
02:30:28,150 --> 02:30:33,150
And uh,
they were the first sponsor and we will 

3552
02:30:33,150 --> 02:30:33,220
always be loyal to theM as much as 
people give a shit about it.

3553
02:30:33,370 --> 02:30:38,370
Oh,
I should probably say something about 

3554
02:30:38,370 --> 02:30:38,370
this fear factor thing.
Yeah.

3555
02:30:38,370 --> 02:30:38,370
Fairfax had got pulled off the air.
Uh,

3556
02:30:38,400 --> 02:30:43,400
we weRe supposed to have a,
an episode where contestants drank 

3557
02:30:43,400 --> 02:30:45,220
donkey,
semen and a donkey urine.

3558
02:30:45,440 --> 02:30:49,120
Um,
apparently folks think it's too much.

3559
02:30:50,170 --> 02:30:51,730
I agree.
Okay.

3560
02:30:51,731 --> 02:30:53,590
After we did it,
I'm going to be honest with you guys,

3561
02:30:53,591 --> 02:30:57,230
and I haven't told anybody this,
but I think I got high with you after it

3562
02:30:57,231 --> 02:30:58,420
was over that day.

3563
02:30:58,630 --> 02:31:00,520
And I remember thinking,
I might haVe told you,

3564
02:31:00,521 --> 02:31:01,750
but I think we fucked up,
man.

3565
02:31:01,751 --> 02:31:03,220
I think we went too far.
I just,

3566
02:31:03,550 --> 02:31:04,840
it just seemed wrong,
man.

3567
02:31:04,841 --> 02:31:06,100
I'm like,
people are not going to like,

3568
02:31:06,160 --> 02:31:09,100
this is gonna make people angry.
Whatever.

3569
02:31:09,101 --> 02:31:09,760
Man.
Somebody.

3570
02:31:09,820 --> 02:31:14,820
Somebody signed off on it.
And then apparently the baCklash was 

3571
02:31:14,820 --> 02:31:15,790
crazy and it shut down your thoughts all
together,

3572
02:31:15,860 --> 02:31:16,990
all the episode,
the episode.

3573
02:31:17,140 --> 02:31:18,400
and there's one episode that's gonna 
air.

3574
02:31:18,401 --> 02:31:23,401
February is our next one,
and there's one other two hour ePisode 

3575
02:31:23,401 --> 02:31:24,240
that's gonna air.
Sometime after that they haven't figured

3576
02:31:24,241 --> 02:31:26,030
out when I put it on the dvd.
No,

3577
02:31:26,031 --> 02:31:26,300
no,
no,

3578
02:31:26,301 --> 02:31:26,640
no,
no.

3579
02:31:26,910 --> 02:31:31,910
I think it's never going to go anywhere.
It's going to be buried and I'll never 

3580
02:31:31,910 --> 02:31:34,341
do it again.
I think they went too far showing throw 

3581
02:31:34,341 --> 02:31:36,000
this shit and not really.
But the stents are so much bigger now.

3582
02:31:36,000 --> 02:31:39,210
This show is so much bigger and crazier 
that they tried to push everything.

3583
02:31:39,480 --> 02:31:41,510
I just think they went too far.
I think it was nutty,

3584
02:31:41,700 --> 02:31:44,760
but I don't think they went to.
I know exactly where there's.

3585
02:31:44,761 --> 02:31:48,510
Everybody has their own standards.
I just don't think that it's fair to ask

3586
02:31:48,511 --> 02:31:50,820
people to do that.
It sounds ridiculous coming from me.

3587
02:31:50,910 --> 02:31:51,990
What?
They don't have to do it.

3588
02:31:51,991 --> 02:31:54,180
I know they don't have to,
but I mean to ask them to do it,

3589
02:31:54,181 --> 02:31:56,640
I think it would've been cool if 
everybody said go fuck yourself.

3590
02:31:56,641 --> 02:31:59,550
And then we had like scrap stunt.
It would have been funny.

3591
02:31:59,580 --> 02:32:00,960
Have you had that happen yet?
No,

3592
02:32:00,961 --> 02:32:02,460
but that would have been a good time,
you know?

3593
02:32:02,461 --> 02:32:03,210
Um,
but,

3594
02:32:03,240 --> 02:32:08,240
you know,
I think it was way easier for girls to 

3595
02:32:08,240 --> 02:32:08,240
do that guys,
you know,

3596
02:32:08,240 --> 02:32:09,360
obviously,
I mean for real,

3597
02:32:09,361 --> 02:32:11,120
even girls were even joking around about
it.

3598
02:32:11,120 --> 02:32:13,680
It was way easier fitting it on their 
chest and rubbing it in.

3599
02:32:13,730 --> 02:32:15,050
Oh,
brian,

3600
02:32:15,120 --> 02:32:17,430
that's your world.
And you live in a dark world.

3601
02:32:17,700 --> 02:32:18,840
Uh,
so look,

3602
02:32:18,870 --> 02:32:23,870
I'm,
I'm sure if we had go back in time they 

3603
02:32:23,870 --> 02:32:26,991
wouldn't do it again.
And the only way you find the limits of 

3604
02:32:26,991 --> 02:32:26,991
these things is you push them.
You know,

3605
02:32:27,730 --> 02:32:28,910
I think it was a mistake.
Oops.

3606
02:32:29,010 --> 02:32:30,990
So it's over.
And uh,

3607
02:32:31,050 --> 02:32:32,460
it,
it would probably never see the light of

3608
02:32:32,461 --> 02:32:37,461
day or five years from now it'll air 
because there's no way they would have 

3609
02:32:37,461 --> 02:32:39,840
considered doing it five years ago when 
fear factor went through its first run.

3610
02:32:39,841 --> 02:32:44,841
I mean,
in season one it was so tame and calm 

3611
02:32:44,841 --> 02:32:44,841
and easy and,
and,

3612
02:32:44,841 --> 02:32:49,520
you know,
and small compared to what it's like 

3613
02:32:49,520 --> 02:32:49,520
now.
Now it's just ridiculous.

3614
02:32:49,520 --> 02:32:51,360
The stumps are huge and crazy and 
explosions and nuts.

3615
02:32:51,750 --> 02:32:53,070
Who knows if they'll ever show that 
again.

3616
02:32:53,130 --> 02:32:53,970
I,
you know,

3617
02:32:53,971 --> 02:32:58,971
I'd rather than not,
I think people shouldn't have to do 

3618
02:32:58,971 --> 02:32:58,971
that.
I think it's too much.

3619
02:32:58,971 --> 02:32:58,971
They fucked up,
but you know,

3620
02:32:58,971 --> 02:33:03,710
whatever we learn,
kill the show kelly episode and we'll 

3621
02:33:03,710 --> 02:33:04,380
march on because we got some good 
episodes coming up.

3622
02:33:04,410 --> 02:33:07,050
It's a better way,
a better show than it ever was before,

3623
02:33:07,380 --> 02:33:12,380
you know,
I hope this doesn't fuck it up for 

3624
02:33:12,380 --> 02:33:12,380
everything else,
but uh,

3625
02:33:12,380 --> 02:33:14,400
I think everybody realizes that was a 
mistake including nbc and,

3626
02:33:14,550 --> 02:33:17,080
you know,
they wanted to push things and just,

3627
02:33:17,100 --> 02:33:22,100
you know,
you don't find out how bad things are 

3628
02:33:22,100 --> 02:33:22,100
until you get people's reactions.
And that's the reaction.

3629
02:33:22,100 --> 02:33:25,320
Woopsies we're sorry,
sorry.

3630
02:33:25,800 --> 02:33:26,820
Um,
so that's it.

3631
02:33:26,821 --> 02:33:30,420
So I've commented on that.
So go to a.

3632
02:33:30,450 --> 02:33:33,180

02:35:11,430 --> 02:35:11,430
been a podcast.
You know,

you know,
we,

3679
02:35:14,890 --> 02:35:19,890
most of the time thought they were just 
a bunch of assholes sit arounD talking 

3680
02:35:19,890 --> 02:35:24,211
about stupid shit while we're high.
Literally we know that the world is 

3681
02:35:24,211 --> 02:35:24,211
filled with assholes that wanted to hear
that guy.

3682
