1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,670
Jesus Louise's the mommies are in the 
house.

2
00:00:03,300 --> 00:00:06,240
I learned so much when I did your show.
I learned about pants,

3
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:09,060
jeans,
and learned about high and tight.

4
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:12,180
I didn't know I had all these tweets 
that were coming my way,

5
00:00:12,181 --> 00:00:13,770
like jeans high and tight.
It's like,

6
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:16,740
what the fuck are these people saying,
these are my friends.

7
00:00:16,750 --> 00:00:19,560
I don't even know the lingo.
I don't know your nonsense.

8
00:00:19,561 --> 00:00:24,561
I don't know the lingo.
It's all very important and we're so 

9
00:00:24,561 --> 00:00:27,621
thankful you made it to the mommy.
I'm very thankful that I was in and I 

10
00:00:27,621 --> 00:00:31,050
also got to learn a tom or black.
Very subtle,

11
00:00:31,650 --> 00:00:35,220
subtle,
subtle cues and you can't jump the gun.

12
00:00:35,370 --> 00:00:37,480
You were really good at it.
Then you did your beach.

13
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:39,860
Every black participant.
That's,

14
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:45,680
that's amazing.
Sydney Casteel went over 10 by the 

15
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:45,680
champ.
Uh,

16
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:49,730
I think you may have there dot pat.
Pat,

17
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:53,130
she was the champ.
I'm trying to remember.

18
00:00:53,131 --> 00:00:55,200
Well,
but I think,

19
00:00:55,201 --> 00:01:00,201
I think you might be the champ.
I have to go back and look at the 

20
00:01:00,201 --> 00:01:00,900
numbers.
We did a lot of the reports,

21
00:01:00,901 --> 00:01:02,170
you know,
I keep notes,

22
00:01:02,810 --> 00:01:04,650
I file it away.
I'll go back and look,

23
00:01:04,651 --> 00:01:09,651
I did a Brendan and Collins podcast this
past week fighter in the kid fighter and

24
00:01:10,111 --> 00:01:13,830
the kid and I did a lot of black voice.
Well,

25
00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:18,860
that's good because I've been getting 
complaints that I haven't had enough 

26
00:01:18,860 --> 00:01:21,201
black guest.
Somebody just tweeted at me the other 

27
00:01:21,201 --> 00:01:21,201
day.

28
00:01:21,201 --> 00:01:21,960
I'm like,
well,

29
00:01:22,620 --> 00:01:25,030
lucky for you Thompson girl will do 
today.

30
00:01:28,460 --> 00:01:29,730
Yes,
yes it should.

31
00:01:29,731 --> 00:01:31,410
If it's not God,
they're just unreasonable.

32
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:33,180
Come on guys.
What the fuck?

33
00:01:33,181 --> 00:01:38,181
What's your deal?
Everybody's so like into being black or 

34
00:01:38,181 --> 00:01:38,181
something.
Let it go.

35
00:01:38,220 --> 00:01:40,730
Everybody got it?
Yeah.

36
00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:45,300
Even that white chick.
How did you guys react to that though?

37
00:01:45,301 --> 00:01:48,540
Chick from the spokane,
Washington head of the NAACP.

38
00:01:48,541 --> 00:01:51,900
By the way,
turns out she was faking being black,

39
00:01:52,230 --> 00:01:53,850
faked her hair,
you know,

40
00:01:53,870 --> 00:01:56,940
made her hair black and frizzy.
It really upsets me.

41
00:01:57,060 --> 00:01:58,830
I got to say,
as a black man,

42
00:01:59,860 --> 00:02:04,620
it's like you don't know my struggle now
I feel like I feel like,

43
00:02:04,650 --> 00:02:05,940
yeah,
of course.

44
00:02:06,150 --> 00:02:07,020
Uh,
she's like,

45
00:02:07,030 --> 00:02:10,290
identify with the culture and it just,
you know,

46
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:12,960
that's who I am.
And I was like,

47
00:02:12,990 --> 00:02:17,990
you know,
I remember when menace to society came 

48
00:02:17,990 --> 00:02:17,990
out,
I was like,

49
00:02:17,990 --> 00:02:18,150
these are my people.

50
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:22,770
I do it.
I remember going home and being like,

51
00:02:22,771 --> 00:02:24,120
Yo,
don't talk to me right now.

52
00:02:24,140 --> 00:02:26,640
Like being all upset.
I was like,

53
00:02:27,030 --> 00:02:28,800
I don't know.
13 or something.

54
00:02:28,801 --> 00:02:30,840
You wanted to identify with those 
people?

55
00:02:30,930 --> 00:02:32,010
One hundred percent.
Okay.

56
00:02:32,011 --> 00:02:37,011
Now if you lived in that neighborhood,
like if you were like around those 

57
00:02:37,011 --> 00:02:41,421
people,
will you have adopted that way of 

58
00:02:41,421 --> 00:02:41,421
talking that?
Well,

59
00:02:41,421 --> 00:02:41,421
first of all I would be dead if I had 
to,

60
00:02:42,330 --> 00:02:47,220
if I lived in that neighborhood.
But I think every,

61
00:02:47,470 --> 00:02:49,320
look,
I think every white kid,

62
00:02:49,350 --> 00:02:54,350
a lot of white kids,
suburban white kids can identify with 

63
00:02:54,350 --> 00:02:56,610
that desire to be part of that culture 
if you grew up.

64
00:02:57,150 --> 00:02:57,980
We grew up in,
you know,

65
00:02:58,140 --> 00:03:01,810
different areas and time places.
But when I was growing up,

66
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:06,730
that's when hip hop had exploded.
And I'm saying part of pop culture,

67
00:03:06,731 --> 00:03:08,050
right?
So you love,

68
00:03:08,051 --> 00:03:13,051
we love the culture.
And then I played sports so every 

69
00:03:13,051 --> 00:03:14,870
basically every great sports figure was 
black.

70
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:21,000
And I'm saying it's a pretty good job.
I got to bring that junk.

71
00:03:26,830 --> 00:03:28,690
Is that bid on a CD or anything?
Nothing.

72
00:03:28,691 --> 00:03:29,830
No,
no.

73
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:32,050
That's insane.
That's a great bit.

74
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:33,760
I should do that again.
Oh my God.

75
00:03:33,790 --> 00:03:38,790
Well,
what a perfect opportunity to bring up 

76
00:03:38,790 --> 00:03:40,980
the fact that you're about to do a new 
special bonds.

77
00:03:41,230 --> 00:03:42,340
First of all,
ladies and gentlemen,

78
00:03:42,341 --> 00:03:44,340
if you live in Boston,
you trying to buy tickets for the will,

79
00:03:44,341 --> 00:03:46,570
but you better jump on that shit now 
because it's almost sold out.

80
00:03:46,810 --> 00:03:49,720
Tommy bonds blowing up all over the 
nation.

81
00:03:53,670 --> 00:03:57,430
Exploding gas leak and someone plays 
with lighters.

82
00:03:58,170 --> 00:03:59,460
Yeah.
It's going to be good man.

83
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:04,960
So put it on that new special shooting.
A new special August seventh where in 

84
00:04:05,430 --> 00:04:07,470
the great city of Seattle.
Oh,

85
00:04:07,860 --> 00:04:12,860
what a great call.
What a great call at the Neptune 

86
00:04:12,860 --> 00:04:12,860
theater.
Seattle is fantastic.

87
00:04:12,860 --> 00:04:14,000
You know,
it's not so great what?

88
00:04:14,190 --> 00:04:19,020
Outside of Seattle.
You just drive our direction.

89
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:21,540
You running into like horse fuck 
territory.

90
00:04:21,541 --> 00:04:22,730
It's like,
oh yeah,

91
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:24,650
yeah,
it is horse fuck territory by law.

92
00:04:24,690 --> 00:04:26,160
Yeah.
That's what that guy got fucked to death

93
00:04:26,161 --> 00:04:26,950
by.
The horse is.

94
00:04:27,990 --> 00:04:32,990
Speaking of that is your bill up?
It's not on any special or you're not 

95
00:04:32,990 --> 00:04:32,990
going to put that on something.
I don't know.

96
00:04:32,990 --> 00:04:35,580
It's too late if.
Thanks so funds dead dead to me.

97
00:04:35,670 --> 00:04:37,580
You've seen.
I've seen the video.

98
00:04:37,610 --> 00:04:39,050
No.
Have you seen his big dreams?

99
00:04:39,110 --> 00:04:40,060
Um,
no.

100
00:04:40,070 --> 00:04:45,070
I'd like to moves on and moves on.
There's a few of those bits back in the 

101
00:04:45,930 --> 00:04:49,260
day that I did for awhile and they just,
I,

102
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:50,250
I just,
you know,

103
00:04:50,251 --> 00:04:53,070
you get tired of them and they'd never 
make it on anything.

104
00:04:53,070 --> 00:04:54,730
He just let them go.
Moving.

105
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:56,460
Yeah.
Can't worry about that though.

106
00:04:56,461 --> 00:05:01,461
You just got to keep moving.
Maybe I have a recorded somewhere and 

107
00:05:01,461 --> 00:05:01,461
I'll just put it online.
That'd be good.

108
00:05:01,461 --> 00:05:01,770
Yeah.
That,

109
00:05:01,790 --> 00:05:06,060
that would be worth it because it's,
you know how it is like once you get,

110
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:09,270
you're not doing it anymore.
It's just you can't just keep doing it.

111
00:05:09,390 --> 00:05:13,290
Have you ever let something go for a 
long time and then somebody's like,

112
00:05:13,291 --> 00:05:18,291
do that,
do that and you do it and it's like 

113
00:05:18,291 --> 00:05:21,170
something was lost in the time that you 
didn't do it in the kind of sucks.

114
00:05:21,790 --> 00:05:26,790
Then like you're like,
I remember that going away better 

115
00:05:26,790 --> 00:05:30,111
before,
but it's also you have to record things 

116
00:05:30,111 --> 00:05:33,231
because sometimes I forget like little 
tiny pieces of bits that make them super

117
00:05:33,391 --> 00:05:36,990
important and you like.
There was one recently that I forgot,

118
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:39,650
like one aspect of it.
Then I listened to an old recording.

119
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:41,850
I went,
Oh yeah,

120
00:05:41,851 --> 00:05:42,870
like,
oh my God,

121
00:05:42,871 --> 00:05:47,010
that's such an important part of it.
That's it's true.

122
00:05:47,170 --> 00:05:51,390
Comedy's such a,
you have to stay on if you don't stay on

123
00:05:51,391 --> 00:05:53,280
a bit and you're not with it all the 
time,

124
00:05:54,510 --> 00:05:57,260
you lose like the rhythm of it,
you'll lose how it goes.

125
00:05:57,290 --> 00:05:57,950
I've bought

126
00:05:58,070 --> 00:06:03,070
like five tracks of mine from itunes 
that are on my phone from being at shows

127
00:06:04,881 --> 00:06:05,540
and being like,
what?

128
00:06:05,570 --> 00:06:08,000
Like how does that go again?
And not remembering.

129
00:06:08,140 --> 00:06:09,590
I didn't have it.
It'd be like old.

130
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:15,040
So I go,
I buy it off of an old album to listen 

131
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:15,040
to while you know,
because I couldn't remember.

132
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:18,230
I go,
I know the bit like I know the framework

133
00:06:18,231 --> 00:06:19,760
of it,
but I forget the,

134
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:24,490
like all the little parts of it.
So then I look like a real narcissists,

135
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:29,030
like just listening to my stuff.
Just wake up,

136
00:06:29,060 --> 00:06:32,560
watch my special every morning going.
Right?

137
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:33,440
Yeah,
of course.

138
00:06:34,170 --> 00:06:34,910
Yeah.
The dogs.

139
00:06:34,911 --> 00:06:39,911
Everybody.
Isn't that because as a comic you kind 

140
00:06:39,911 --> 00:06:41,300
of have to listen to your stuff.
You have to watch your stuff,

141
00:06:41,301 --> 00:06:46,301
you have to listen to your stuff,
but you don't want anybody catching you 

142
00:06:46,301 --> 00:06:46,301
doing it.

143
00:06:46,301 --> 00:06:46,301
No,
that's the.

144
00:06:46,301 --> 00:06:51,131
Yeah.
Like if you were on a plane on your 

145
00:06:51,131 --> 00:06:51,131
laptop and you're watching your own 
special crazy.

146
00:06:51,860 --> 00:06:53,900
There are people that do love to watch 
themselves.

147
00:06:55,470 --> 00:06:57,070
They're usually new,
right?

148
00:06:58,960 --> 00:06:59,750
I don't.
Yeah.

149
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:04,640
I don't like anything I do.
I never like anything I do ever.

150
00:07:04,641 --> 00:07:06,230
I don't like watching myself on 
anything,

151
00:07:06,231 --> 00:07:11,231
on television.
Listening to my standup it during your 

152
00:07:11,231 --> 00:07:13,901
own voice pains me and if I like it,
it's once I like it once and then after 

153
00:07:13,901 --> 00:07:16,490
that I'm like,
I can wash it again because you'll go,

154
00:07:16,491 --> 00:07:17,210
oh,
what did I do?

155
00:07:17,211 --> 00:07:19,070
Like this?
Why did I have more of a pause?

156
00:07:19,071 --> 00:07:24,071
Like I feel like I'm rushing it.
I feel like I'm going too slow or I'm 

157
00:07:24,071 --> 00:07:25,040
feeling I'm done.
But that's how you get good.

158
00:07:25,041 --> 00:07:30,041
You got to be dissatisfied.
And when you run into someone and they 

159
00:07:30,041 --> 00:07:30,041
love everything they do,
they almost always suck.

160
00:07:30,041 --> 00:07:30,860
Yeah,
that's true.

161
00:07:30,980 --> 00:07:31,570
Yeah.
That's,

162
00:07:32,470 --> 00:07:34,160
it's never done.
Fucking.

163
00:07:34,161 --> 00:07:39,161
Nothing's ever done.
David Letterman was said to hate 

164
00:07:39,161 --> 00:07:39,320
everything he ever did come home and 
just be like,

165
00:07:39,321 --> 00:07:40,940
that was the worst episode I've ever 
done.

166
00:07:41,090 --> 00:07:46,090
Well,
my friend used to be his assistant and 

167
00:07:46,090 --> 00:07:46,090
after,
after like,

168
00:07:46,090 --> 00:07:48,080
like he would film a show and they would
fucking throw things around his office.

169
00:07:48,081 --> 00:07:50,660
I fucking suck.
Like you would get crazy and mad.

170
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:56,800
We get mad.
He would just take a notebook filled 

171
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:58,100
with shit fucking slam against a window.
He didn't give a fuck who's angry?

172
00:07:58,130 --> 00:08:03,000
Some guy told me a story once that he 
was a guest on Letterman a while ago and

173
00:08:03,001 --> 00:08:08,001
that he was going after the show,
he was going to go to Montana for him to

174
00:08:08,091 --> 00:08:13,091
see his family was during the holidays.
It was like the last episode before 

175
00:08:13,091 --> 00:08:13,091
Christmas and that,
um,

176
00:08:13,340 --> 00:08:18,340
and then letterman had a place in 
Montana and so they discussed it on the 

177
00:08:18,340 --> 00:08:18,470
air.

178
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:19,850
It was like,
oh,

179
00:08:19,851 --> 00:08:21,080
like I'm going to Montana,
and he was like,

180
00:08:21,081 --> 00:08:21,620
yeah,
me too.

181
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:24,830
And then they went to commercial break 
and he was like,

182
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:29,920
how are you getting there to let him in?
He was like flying private and he goes,

183
00:08:31,250 --> 00:08:32,270
what?
He goes,

184
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:39,720
there's no way we're getting on the same
plane together because he was 

185
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:40,280
notoriously kind of antisocial,
you know?

186
00:08:40,460 --> 00:08:45,460
Whoa.
Who's this guy trying to fucking hopper 

187
00:08:45,460 --> 00:08:45,460
royal?
Yeah,

188
00:08:45,460 --> 00:08:45,980
I know it's crazy.
Dudes are weasels,

189
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:47,900
weasel like that to like,
hey,

190
00:08:47,901 --> 00:08:52,901
maybe you can take me with you.
I mean I asked him my ticket and save 

191
00:08:52,901 --> 00:08:56,861
some money and then annoy you.
A guy asked me that on a flight to New 

192
00:08:56,861 --> 00:08:58,890
York one time what he asked you if he 
was like,

193
00:08:58,891 --> 00:09:03,891
what are you going for?
And I was going to shoot a commercial 

194
00:09:03,891 --> 00:09:03,891
and then he was like,
where are you staying?

195
00:09:03,891 --> 00:09:03,891
I was like,
in the city,

196
00:09:03,891 --> 00:09:04,590
you know,
whatever.

197
00:09:04,591 --> 00:09:06,380
They put him up at a hotel.
Oh,

198
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:07,830
they picking you up?
Like car service?

199
00:09:07,831 --> 00:09:08,400
Yeah.
He's like,

200
00:09:08,580 --> 00:09:09,100
you think I could get her

201
00:09:09,590 --> 00:09:13,330
ride a guy that you just met right 
there,

202
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:14,100
right on the.
Yeah,

203
00:09:14,180 --> 00:09:19,180
and that was not a good sign.
If somebody imposing themselves on you 

204
00:09:19,180 --> 00:09:19,180
like that,
that's,

205
00:09:19,180 --> 00:09:20,590
that's not the kind of person that you 
want to hang out with these,

206
00:09:20,860 --> 00:09:25,860
but there could be a conversation where 
you're talking to a guy and you're 

207
00:09:25,860 --> 00:09:25,960
having a great time.
You haven't lapsed.

208
00:09:25,961 --> 00:09:27,970
You have a few drinks,
a five hour flight.

209
00:09:28,060 --> 00:09:30,330
The guy's got a great sense of humor and
you're like,

210
00:09:30,340 --> 00:09:33,040
where you stand on the street?
Do you need a ride?

211
00:09:33,100 --> 00:09:35,920
Oh,
that's great,

212
00:09:36,460 --> 00:09:38,320
but do you think you could give me a 
ride?

213
00:09:38,321 --> 00:09:43,321
Is almost never a good question.
It's a little presents as a friend,

214
00:09:44,910 --> 00:09:46,180
you know,
and he asked me,

215
00:09:46,181 --> 00:09:46,870
he's like,
what are you getting?

216
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:50,960
What are you making for this commercial?
I go,

217
00:09:50,961 --> 00:09:53,060
I was trying to be like a miracle about 
it.

218
00:09:53,420 --> 00:09:54,980
I was like,
I don't know,

219
00:09:54,981 --> 00:09:57,030
you get like a day rate,
you know,

220
00:09:57,110 --> 00:09:59,660
and then it's all about the residuals.
And he was like,

221
00:09:59,661 --> 00:10:04,661
Huh.
And I was explaining it to him and then 

222
00:10:04,661 --> 00:10:04,661
he told me what he did and I go,
so like,

223
00:10:04,661 --> 00:10:04,661
what is that?
I was like,

224
00:10:04,661 --> 00:10:05,900
returning the question,
right?

225
00:10:05,930 --> 00:10:06,680
What do you make?
He goes,

226
00:10:06,830 --> 00:10:07,920
oh,
I would never divulge that.

227
00:10:11,270 --> 00:10:14,000
I just told you everything.
Know I'm not telling you this shit.

228
00:10:14,730 --> 00:10:18,830
Don't fault.
Did he have a reason for that?

229
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:23,920
He was like,
just the type of work that I do with my 

230
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:24,890
clients wouldn't appreciate me develop.
I would say welcome to my act.

231
00:10:24,980 --> 00:10:29,980
Yeah,
you're fucking weird talking about you a

232
00:10:30,021 --> 00:10:35,021
lot.
I'm going to try to open with you 

233
00:10:35,021 --> 00:10:35,850
tonight.
Weirdos.

234
00:10:35,870 --> 00:10:37,610
You sit next to,
on a plane.

235
00:10:37,700 --> 00:10:38,990
I just make up lies.
Now.

236
00:10:38,991 --> 00:10:40,850
I don't tell them what I really do.
Really.

237
00:10:41,670 --> 00:10:45,640
It opens up that whole were even married
a.

238
00:10:46,260 --> 00:10:49,430
is it funny all the time and you know,
I can't,

239
00:10:49,660 --> 00:10:50,620
I just,
I can't.

240
00:10:51,230 --> 00:10:54,780
Very finite tolerance for people.
What's your goat?

241
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:57,050
Do you have a goto professional?
I say,

242
00:10:57,051 --> 00:10:58,850
uh,
immigration paralegal.

243
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:01,670
Because I did that at a point in my life
and it's not that interesting.

244
00:11:01,690 --> 00:11:03,560
Like there's not too many follow up 
question.

245
00:11:03,590 --> 00:11:05,660
That's a good one.
What's a good one?

246
00:11:05,810 --> 00:11:08,240
You can't get away with two famous back 
in the day.

247
00:11:08,241 --> 00:11:10,880
I used to tell girls that I worked for 
my father's insurance company.

248
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:13,040
That's a good one.
Insurance.

249
00:11:13,250 --> 00:11:15,500
Oh my God.
I had this one girl berate me,

250
00:11:15,990 --> 00:11:18,830
berate me for my lack of ambition and 
you know,

251
00:11:18,870 --> 00:11:20,890
telling me what a pitch I was.
And uh,

252
00:11:20,900 --> 00:11:21,920
and then I told her,
I go,

253
00:11:21,990 --> 00:11:22,970
look,
I go,

254
00:11:22,971 --> 00:11:25,090
I only have to work eight hours a day.
I go,

255
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:28,070
the rest of the day is entirely mine.
I can do whatever I want,

256
00:11:28,071 --> 00:11:28,830
like,
you know.

257
00:11:29,390 --> 00:11:32,690
And she was like,
don't you want to do your own thing?

258
00:11:32,691 --> 00:11:34,460
Like why do you want to work for your 
parents?

259
00:11:34,730 --> 00:11:35,090
You know,
like,

260
00:11:35,091 --> 00:11:37,880
you think that's cool to work for your 
father's company?

261
00:11:37,881 --> 00:11:39,080
Like,
that's pathetic.

262
00:11:39,530 --> 00:11:40,100
I go,
well,

263
00:11:40,101 --> 00:11:41,470
it's a family business.
Oh,

264
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:42,110
she was brutal.

265
00:11:42,380 --> 00:11:45,530
It was a family business and you know,
I'm like,

266
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:49,130
but I live in my dad's basement.
I took it to the next level so I save on

267
00:11:49,131 --> 00:11:50,360
rent.
And she was.

268
00:11:50,390 --> 00:11:52,820
So were you attracted to this woman?
She's very pretty.

269
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:54,610
Yeah.
She's very pretty.

270
00:11:54,820 --> 00:11:56,410
She,
she was brutalizing me.

271
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:57,180
Yeah.
And I,

272
00:11:57,250 --> 00:11:59,200
I let her go for a let it go for a long 
time.

273
00:11:59,201 --> 00:12:00,870
What does she do for a living?
I have no idea.

274
00:12:00,871 --> 00:12:02,370
I didn't even fucking ass.
She's hot,

275
00:12:02,490 --> 00:12:04,970
she's hot to do,
Bro.

276
00:12:05,230 --> 00:12:10,230
I just was shocked how mean she was.
And then someone came over and asked me 

277
00:12:10,230 --> 00:12:10,230
for a photo and then,
uh,

278
00:12:10,231 --> 00:12:13,390
I took a photo with this person and then
she started figuring it out.

279
00:12:13,420 --> 00:12:15,430
This is,
I think it was either fear fact,

280
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:18,640
like the early days of fear factor.
And then she started figuring it out.

281
00:12:18,670 --> 00:12:23,670
She goes,
you don't work for your father's 

282
00:12:23,670 --> 00:12:23,670
insurance company.

283
00:12:23,670 --> 00:12:23,670
I own a no go,
but you're a cunt.

284
00:12:23,670 --> 00:12:24,310
You're a fucking mean person.
I go,

285
00:12:24,311 --> 00:12:25,570
what if,
what if I did like it?

286
00:12:25,571 --> 00:12:26,800
What if I did?
She goes,

287
00:12:26,801 --> 00:12:27,880
what do you do?
I go,

288
00:12:28,180 --> 00:12:31,030
I'm on television.
I have a television show the fuck,

289
00:12:31,190 --> 00:12:32,020
you know.
And she was like,

290
00:12:32,021 --> 00:12:33,700
why'd you lie to me?
And I'm like,

291
00:12:33,730 --> 00:12:38,730
well,
why were you such an asshole to me for 

292
00:12:38,730 --> 00:12:38,730
telling you I work for an insurance 
company?

293
00:12:38,730 --> 00:12:39,700
Like I could see if you didn't want to 
be attracted to someone like that.

294
00:12:39,701 --> 00:12:44,701
But that's rude.
How hard did she come when you guys did 

295
00:12:44,701 --> 00:12:44,701
have sex?
Was it like intense bugger?

296
00:12:44,701 --> 00:12:49,470
Oh No,
I never even never even hung out with 

297
00:12:49,470 --> 00:12:52,291
her after that night.
I knew there was something off in the 

298
00:12:52,291 --> 00:12:52,291
first place,
so that's when I would go to my father's

299
00:12:52,291 --> 00:12:56,881
insurance company line,
that kind of gold digger attitude.

300
00:12:58,020 --> 00:12:59,980
I don't want to be racist,
but she was.

301
00:13:00,150 --> 00:13:05,150
And.
But that means thing that materialistic 

302
00:13:06,911 --> 00:13:09,230
folks in that culture,
a very pretty girls,

303
00:13:09,250 --> 00:13:14,250
very nice people for the most part.
Very family oriented Shahs of sunset 

304
00:13:14,250 --> 00:13:14,250
baby.
What's that?

305
00:13:14,250 --> 00:13:18,560
That show is so preposterous.
Crazy types.

306
00:13:18,860 --> 00:13:20,200
Yeah.
That's great.

307
00:13:20,260 --> 00:13:21,570
Yeah.
Yeah.

308
00:13:21,610 --> 00:13:24,150
A lot of the girls I grew up around,
uh,

309
00:13:24,170 --> 00:13:26,260
they,
they had to maintain their virginity for

310
00:13:26,261 --> 00:13:28,170
marriage.
So a lot of them,

311
00:13:28,171 --> 00:13:29,320
it took them the.
But yes.

312
00:13:29,690 --> 00:13:33,960
Paula did you.
I did know.

313
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:35,890
Is that really true?
That's what they were doing.

314
00:13:35,950 --> 00:13:36,370
Well,
the,

315
00:13:36,490 --> 00:13:41,490
yeah,
the one girl that I was pretty close 

316
00:13:41,490 --> 00:13:41,490
with,
she was 18 years old.

317
00:13:41,490 --> 00:13:45,751
I was 13 and like we hung out a lot.
I take the bus to the beach from the 

318
00:13:45,751 --> 00:13:48,310
valley and smoke cigarettes and uh,
yeah,

319
00:13:48,311 --> 00:13:53,311
she took it in the but she was five 
years old and new.

320
00:13:54,590 --> 00:13:57,580
It's one thing if you're 30 and she's 
35,

321
00:13:57,730 --> 00:14:01,150
that's totally normal,
but 15 and 18,

322
00:14:01,180 --> 00:14:02,980
that's a fucking giant.
13,

323
00:14:04,430 --> 00:14:05,830
15,
13 and 18.

324
00:14:05,831 --> 00:14:07,060
Yeah,
that's a giant gap.

325
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:12,120
That's a jeff.
Five years is a giant five years and I 

326
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:13,180
think part of that is she was so 
sheltered,

327
00:14:13,181 --> 00:14:17,950
she'd grown up in such a strict Persian 
family that maybe mentally she was 13.

328
00:14:17,980 --> 00:14:22,980
You know what I mean?
Like I taught her to smoke cigarettes 

329
00:14:22,980 --> 00:14:22,980
and stuff.
Whoa.

330
00:14:22,980 --> 00:14:22,990
You told her?
Yeah.

331
00:14:23,050 --> 00:14:28,050
She was real sheltered.
Jesus shed like we take the bus to the 

332
00:14:28,050 --> 00:14:31,471
beach and she would have to stop at a 
payphone every hour to call her dad and 

333
00:14:31,471 --> 00:14:32,500
check in.
That's how strict they were.

334
00:14:32,530 --> 00:14:36,340
Oh my God.
So I wonder what happened.

335
00:14:36,341 --> 00:14:37,730
What was her rationale?
Well,

336
00:14:37,750 --> 00:14:42,750
probably like buddies.
How many times do you take in the ass 

337
00:14:43,181 --> 00:14:48,181
for everything breaks down prolapses 
that rectal prolapse driving off road 

338
00:14:48,191 --> 00:14:49,590
with a car that's not designed for it.

339
00:14:53,940 --> 00:14:56,150
It's like you got the wrong tires on 
that vehicle.

340
00:14:57,750 --> 00:15:00,620
Do you understand that?
I don't.

341
00:15:00,860 --> 00:15:04,460
I've never honestly listen,
never been to know about this,

342
00:15:05,290 --> 00:15:07,400
but with reasonably good reason.
It's,

343
00:15:07,460 --> 00:15:11,420
it's chocolate,
there's a lot of wrong,

344
00:15:11,710 --> 00:15:13,940
mean first of all,
she'd be a lot of clean up,

345
00:15:13,941 --> 00:15:16,670
involved pre and post it.
Yeah.

346
00:15:16,850 --> 00:15:18,370
But second,
this girl,

347
00:15:18,470 --> 00:15:23,150
what was her rationale to maintain 
purity and that's a very common thing.

348
00:15:23,180 --> 00:15:26,750
And like how did she explain it though,
that I have to be married a virgin,

349
00:15:26,751 --> 00:15:31,751
that my father,
they checked the bedsheets on your 

350
00:15:31,751 --> 00:15:34,350
wedding night and dad eats you out if 
you're a person and then he can tell.

351
00:15:39,890 --> 00:15:42,320
That's right Tom.
Exactly how it went.

352
00:15:42,350 --> 00:15:42,890
Yeah.
Yeah.

353
00:15:42,891 --> 00:15:46,760
Normal finishes up and he's like,
eats you still good.

354
00:15:46,761 --> 00:15:51,761
So it's a little bloody fucking Christ 
Jesus Christ.

355
00:15:52,761 --> 00:15:57,761
It's so crazy.
So when she explained it to where you 

356
00:15:57,761 --> 00:16:00,040
like at 13,
you're probably wait what mean?

357
00:16:00,070 --> 00:16:03,380
But in the book,
I mean it's like I knew about sex was.

358
00:16:03,860 --> 00:16:06,720
I mean I was at,
I wasn't doing anything.

359
00:16:08,740 --> 00:16:10,740
I mean I was getting my ass fingers.
I was 13.

360
00:16:13,330 --> 00:16:14,180
I was very,
you know,

361
00:16:14,181 --> 00:16:16,190
an experience.
I was just blown away.

362
00:16:16,191 --> 00:16:17,210
And uh,
and uh,

363
00:16:17,540 --> 00:16:20,390
she was so funny.
This is so awesome memory I have of her.

364
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:25,600
I was wearing a tank top and it was 
summertime and I remember she poked my 

365
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:27,140
armpit fat.
She goes,

366
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:32,200
Ooh girl,
you got to have big tvs where you grow 

367
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:33,560
up,
arm pit giveaway and fatty,

368
00:16:33,561 --> 00:16:35,000
and I live in La.
She was right.

369
00:16:35,001 --> 00:16:36,260
Yeah,
I was armpit fat.

370
00:16:36,290 --> 00:16:37,590
That's hilarious.
I just,

371
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:39,860
I thought that it was,
it was bizarre,

372
00:16:39,861 --> 00:16:44,480
but she explained that it was a 
religious thing and this was to maintain

373
00:16:44,481 --> 00:16:46,640
her purity.
God wants her to take in the.

374
00:16:46,641 --> 00:16:50,320
But God wants you to do anal.
So is it that they,

375
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:55,440
they tell you to take in the ass instead
of in the vagina or that's like the 

376
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:56,840
option that you choose because it 
doesn't.

377
00:16:56,841 --> 00:16:58,400
It's not written anywhere that you can 
do that.

378
00:16:58,430 --> 00:17:02,050
I think it's a technical rule.
I don't know what the UFC term is.

379
00:17:04,270 --> 00:17:07,490
Technicalities like that in the UFC.
The very unfortunate.

380
00:17:07,810 --> 00:17:08,680
Yeah.
Yeah.

381
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:13,720
So it's like of kicking it down to 
ponant no knees to the head when you're 

382
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:14,810
on the ground.
Isn't there a back of the head rule too?

383
00:17:15,250 --> 00:17:15,730
Yeah.
Yeah.

384
00:17:16,060 --> 00:17:18,100
Which is kind of.
It's,

385
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:23,400
it's only applicable when your on the 
ground because in standup,

386
00:17:24,760 --> 00:17:28,030
like guys get kicked in the back of the 
head all the time because when you throw

387
00:17:28,031 --> 00:17:31,420
a kick like save two guys are standing 
there and you throw a head kick.

388
00:17:31,570 --> 00:17:36,570
When you throw a head kick,
your foot wraps around the back of 

389
00:17:36,570 --> 00:17:36,970
someone's head and a lot of times that's
what hits first.

390
00:17:36,971 --> 00:17:40,330
The instep hits the back of their head.
It happens all the time.

391
00:17:40,331 --> 00:17:45,331
Especially if someone's standing like if
the your opponent has his left foot 

392
00:17:45,331 --> 00:17:49,531
forward and you have your left foot 
forward and you throw a kick basically 

393
00:17:49,531 --> 00:17:49,550
to the head.
You're hitting him the back of the head.

394
00:17:49,670 --> 00:17:50,250
It happens

395
00:17:50,250 --> 00:17:52,710
all the time,
but that when that happens,

396
00:17:52,770 --> 00:17:54,830
that's not considered a violation of the
no.

397
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:59,880
You guys get knocked out from getting 
kicked in the back of the head and when 

398
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:01,450
they're standing and it's fine and in,
in,

399
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:04,620
in wild punching exchange,
guys get hit in the back of the head and

400
00:18:04,621 --> 00:18:09,621
no one ever gives him a hard time.
You can't give them a deliberate punch 

401
00:18:09,621 --> 00:18:10,230
to when they're on the ground.
If you hit them in the back of the head,

402
00:18:10,290 --> 00:18:13,260
then it's considered a foul.
You see it a lot.

403
00:18:13,860 --> 00:18:15,390
Oh yeah.
I mean there's the foul.

404
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:20,600
The fouls happen a lot.
It gets called a lot and it happens a 

405
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:20,910
lot.
Well because when you're,

406
00:18:21,390 --> 00:18:23,430
excuse me,
when guys were on the ground and there's

407
00:18:23,431 --> 00:18:26,600
a scramble going on,
people are moving and you,

408
00:18:26,601 --> 00:18:29,040
you go to throw a punch but the guy's 
not there.

409
00:18:29,130 --> 00:18:32,040
Like from the time you go to throw the 
punch to the punch landing,

410
00:18:32,250 --> 00:18:33,870
there's a little space there so you 
know,

411
00:18:33,910 --> 00:18:38,910
half a second or whatever it is and the 
person sees it and they move a little 

412
00:18:38,910 --> 00:18:42,291
and sometimes when they move you 
accidentally hit him in the back of the 

413
00:18:42,291 --> 00:18:44,160
head and then sometimes you throwing 
punches that aren't totally specific.

414
00:18:44,220 --> 00:18:49,220
You're just trying to win and then some 
of them hit the back of the head or 

415
00:18:49,220 --> 00:18:52,910
there's intentional ones too.
So it's very hard to decipher what's 

416
00:18:52,910 --> 00:18:52,910
what.
This wasn't a bag that,

417
00:18:52,910 --> 00:18:55,080
but I've probably been to,
I don't know,

418
00:18:55,170 --> 00:19:00,170
a dozen or more UFC is with you.
And the last one that I went to was in 

419
00:19:00,170 --> 00:19:04,581
Vegas,
and that Brown Arlovski fight the 

420
00:19:04,771 --> 00:19:08,100
craziest things of all the rounds and 
fights that I've witnessed.

421
00:19:08,460 --> 00:19:13,460
I don't know if I've ever seen a fight 
like that and I've never seen felt the 

422
00:19:13,621 --> 00:19:17,820
energy shift and explode the way that it
did in that round.

423
00:19:17,850 --> 00:19:20,100
It was really crazy.
It was a wild round.

424
00:19:20,250 --> 00:19:22,230
I didn't even realize how crazy that 
was.

425
00:19:22,231 --> 00:19:24,210
I didn't realize I was standing up.
Yeah,

426
00:19:24,300 --> 00:19:29,300
we talked about that and we talked about
how the entire standing up he was doing 

427
00:19:29,300 --> 00:19:29,300
commentary.

428
00:19:31,750 --> 00:19:33,870
Because I'm wearing.
I don't have a microphone in front of me

429
00:19:33,871 --> 00:19:38,871
like this.
I have a microphone that's attached to 

430
00:19:38,871 --> 00:19:39,000
my headset,
so when I stand up it's still attached.

431
00:19:39,270 --> 00:19:42,420
So it just goes to this box and all this
jazz.

432
00:19:42,421 --> 00:19:45,840
The wire connects to this thing.
So I'm standing up doing commentary.

433
00:19:45,841 --> 00:19:50,841
I literally didn't realize I was 
standing up until it was already 

434
00:19:50,841 --> 00:19:50,841
happening.
Nobody was seated.

435
00:19:50,841 --> 00:19:51,280
Nobody.
Nobody.

436
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:55,770
Nobody know the tire.
The people right around the octagon.

437
00:19:55,950 --> 00:20:00,950
Every single person.
It was so crazy that you couldn't help 

438
00:20:00,950 --> 00:20:01,530
it because that happens during fights.
Here it is,

439
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:09,920
and that's why while I'm working,
I didn't even know what was going on.

440
00:20:09,921 --> 00:20:11,520
Like while it was working,
I stood up.

441
00:20:11,660 --> 00:20:15,690
Yeah,
I had no idea it was.

442
00:20:16,110 --> 00:20:17,310
It was such an intense.
Yeah.

443
00:20:17,340 --> 00:20:19,170
I'm like going like,
I'm like home alone.

444
00:20:20,120 --> 00:20:21,540
Goodness.
Well this,

445
00:20:21,541 --> 00:20:26,541
this shift.
What was happening there is what was so 

446
00:20:26,541 --> 00:20:29,391
amazed that that would be my sell to 
anybody that wasn't into it is just to 

447
00:20:29,391 --> 00:20:31,250
experience the feeling,
you know,

448
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:33,090
of the energy in an arena like,
for,

449
00:20:33,110 --> 00:20:35,400
for people that aren't into whatever 
sports.

450
00:20:35,401 --> 00:20:36,180
Like,
dude,

451
00:20:36,181 --> 00:20:36,990
you can't.
You can't.

452
00:20:37,170 --> 00:20:39,340
You can't bottle that up.
You can't deny that that's,

453
00:20:39,540 --> 00:20:41,850
that currently exists like that in any 
other sport either.

454
00:20:41,851 --> 00:20:46,851
There's great moments in sports where 
someone scores a three pointer at the 

455
00:20:46,851 --> 00:20:48,020
buzzer and wins the game or you know,
a

456
00:20:48,070 --> 00:20:51,460
great pass gets delivered.
The guy runs 100 yards.

457
00:20:51,580 --> 00:20:55,360
There's those moments in sports,
but it's so different than a guy fucking

458
00:20:55,361 --> 00:20:56,620
another guy on fighting.
Yeah.

459
00:20:56,740 --> 00:21:00,280
Or a woman fucking another woman up like
that fight that's passed when we can,

460
00:21:00,281 --> 00:21:02,160
that we were talking about before the 
podcast starts.

461
00:21:02,590 --> 00:21:06,910
You on a young jet check this fucking 
bad ass bitch from Poland.

462
00:21:07,450 --> 00:21:09,280
Oh my God,
she's good.

463
00:21:09,430 --> 00:21:13,220
She might be like one of the best 
strikers in all of MMA period.

464
00:21:13,250 --> 00:21:14,770
Cheap,
battered like top five.

465
00:21:15,220 --> 00:21:19,210
She battered her.
She's a six time world Moy Thai champion

466
00:21:19,660 --> 00:21:22,830
and she's also from Poland and it's just
like a.

467
00:21:22,900 --> 00:21:26,170
something about the fucking.

468
00:21:29,430 --> 00:21:34,430
I was watching Anthony Bourdain's parts 
unknown and he went to Budapest and my 

469
00:21:34,430 --> 00:21:38,841
last name is Polish,
but were Hungarians and the whole 

470
00:21:38,841 --> 00:21:41,601
episode was about the suffering and the 
harshness and the misery of how 

471
00:21:41,601 --> 00:21:45,240
everything sucks because they were 
ravaged by world war one,

472
00:21:45,270 --> 00:21:50,270
World War II,
and then the Russians came and screwed 

473
00:21:50,270 --> 00:21:53,181
up hungry.
So it's essentially a hundred years of 

474
00:21:53,181 --> 00:21:53,181
just misery,
but that breeds

475
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:58,960
titers walled.
Russian Russians are known for being 

476
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:03,281
tough,
like some of the best boxers in the 

477
00:22:03,281 --> 00:22:04,841
world today are Russian.
There's they're coming over here and 

478
00:22:04,841 --> 00:22:04,841
droves.
Sergei Kovalev,

479
00:22:04,841 --> 00:22:07,250
Gennady Golovkin and the UFC.
There's a bunch of them.

480
00:22:07,251 --> 00:22:12,251
There's a bunch of fucking fighters from
that part of the world that are just so 

481
00:22:12,251 --> 00:22:16,181
hard.
You think we'll see a triple g canelo 

482
00:22:16,181 --> 00:22:16,181
fight?
Yes,

483
00:22:16,181 --> 00:22:18,110
I think so.
I think Canelo's going to fight cotto.

484
00:22:18,111 --> 00:22:23,111
If he gets past Codo we're going to see 
him versus Golovkin and I think if he 

485
00:22:23,111 --> 00:22:23,990
doesn't guess past Cota we're going to 
see.

486
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:26,240
Oh,
versus Golovkin glove could.

487
00:22:26,241 --> 00:22:31,241
The only thing against him,
from what I follow is that he doesn't 

488
00:22:31,241 --> 00:22:32,080
really have any names under his belt.
Right?

489
00:22:32,470 --> 00:22:34,940
Because they're scared of him,
but people are scared they're running.

490
00:22:35,060 --> 00:22:36,720
Nobody wants to fight that dude.
That dude is.

491
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,200
He's a dangerous guy.
Yeah,

492
00:22:39,201 --> 00:22:40,610
he's from Kazakhstan.

493
00:22:40,820 --> 00:22:42,180
Yeah.
So his,

494
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:44,960
his floyd mayweather.
His Dad called him a giant.

495
00:22:44,961 --> 00:22:45,610
He goes,
wait,

496
00:22:45,870 --> 00:22:46,720
no damn.
Johnny.

497
00:22:47,410 --> 00:22:48,830
Johnny,
we just won 60.

498
00:22:48,890 --> 00:22:51,110
Hey you fights at one 60.
I mean you're black.

499
00:22:51,111 --> 00:22:53,510
That was pretty good.
Just so you know very much.

500
00:22:53,890 --> 00:22:58,890
Thank you very much.
So he's only six pounds heavier than 

501
00:22:58,890 --> 00:23:02,471
floyd,
which in the UFC is nothing but that 

502
00:23:02,471 --> 00:23:05,360
happens all the time.
And the UFC guys that are 185 talk about

503
00:23:05,361 --> 00:23:06,500
fighting at two.
Oh five.

504
00:23:06,740 --> 00:23:11,740
Which is 20 pounds difference.
Like Chris Weidman is talking about 

505
00:23:11,740 --> 00:23:12,530
fighting John Jones and unification 
fight Madison Square Garden.

506
00:23:12,650 --> 00:23:13,790
That was awesome.
By the wide,

507
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:14,900
if I was,
oh my God,

508
00:23:14,901 --> 00:23:16,640
he's a beast.
He's a fucking beast.

509
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:21,720
Weidman versus going forward now.
That was not a team wide window joined 

510
00:23:22,731 --> 00:23:23,900
now.
Yeah,

511
00:23:23,901 --> 00:23:28,310
but that's a giant jump.
Twenty pound jump and Gennady.

512
00:23:28,311 --> 00:23:29,900
Golovkin is so good.
The Floyd Mayweather,

513
00:23:29,901 --> 00:23:31,730
his dad,
Floyd Mayweather,

514
00:23:31,731 --> 00:23:35,060
who in my opinion is the best boxer the 
world has ever seen.

515
00:23:35,420 --> 00:23:40,420
I think he's the best.
I know you might not like him as a 

516
00:23:40,420 --> 00:23:40,420
person.
You might think his style is boring,

517
00:23:40,610 --> 00:23:42,890
but when it comes to hitting people and 
not getting hit,

518
00:23:42,980 --> 00:23:44,950
who the fuck is better ever?
Right?

519
00:23:45,140 --> 00:23:46,070
Better.
And

520
00:23:46,070 --> 00:23:46,820
people could say,
wow,

521
00:23:46,821 --> 00:23:49,430
he hasn't fought anybody know?
He's so good.

522
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:52,550
He makes people that are great.
Look not that good.

523
00:23:52,700 --> 00:23:55,480
What would he do to Canelo and Canelo is
destroying everybody.

524
00:23:55,630 --> 00:23:58,220
He Shut Canelo down and look what he did
to PAC man.

525
00:23:58,250 --> 00:24:00,170
Shut them down.
He just shuts you down.

526
00:24:00,470 --> 00:24:01,070
I mean,
yeah,

527
00:24:01,071 --> 00:24:06,071
pack out a fucked up shoulder.
But he was throwing it mean he's 

528
00:24:06,071 --> 00:24:06,071
throwing punches in that fight.
Yeah.

529
00:24:06,350 --> 00:24:07,560
Now he's a bad ass.
He's the.

530
00:24:07,580 --> 00:24:09,470
He's the best.
He's the best boxer.

531
00:24:09,471 --> 00:24:12,200
He's very,
very smart because he does ask to watch.

532
00:24:12,201 --> 00:24:13,730
It's right.
It's not showtime.

533
00:24:14,030 --> 00:24:15,140
Where if you're like,
I want to go.

534
00:24:15,141 --> 00:24:20,141
I want to see some shit go down,
but if you like to study the sweet 

535
00:24:20,141 --> 00:24:23,981
science,
you want to watch somebody box like 

536
00:24:23,981 --> 00:24:25,610
counter punch,
throw technically perfect punches,

537
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:27,650
a slip.
Everything.

538
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:28,790
Yup.
There's nothing better.

539
00:24:28,820 --> 00:24:30,320
He's wearing a lab coat every time he 
fights.

540
00:24:30,350 --> 00:24:31,710
He's a fucking scientists.
True.

541
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,890
He's the best.
His Dad.

542
00:24:33,980 --> 00:24:35,750
Oh,
when he was with HBO.

543
00:24:36,310 --> 00:24:41,310
Hbo,
24 slash seven is so much better than 

544
00:24:41,310 --> 00:24:45,120
times behind the seat.
Like 24 slash seven is a masterpiece at 

545
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:48,791
the time and yeah,
they when him and his dad were arguing 

546
00:24:48,791 --> 00:24:49,370
with each other and ms that and also 
when Roger,

547
00:24:49,371 --> 00:24:50,750
his uncle.
Who's his.

548
00:24:50,850 --> 00:24:52,700
His trainer.
That's right.

549
00:24:52,701 --> 00:24:54,770
His uncle,
his uncle who just got teeth.

550
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:56,900
It was much better than me.
Then he got teeth.

551
00:24:56,901 --> 00:24:57,750
He got teeth now.
Yeah.

552
00:24:58,130 --> 00:25:00,620
He used to have like three teeth and 
they would be the best team.

553
00:25:01,100 --> 00:25:03,770
The best was,
I think floyd fought Kodo,

554
00:25:03,771 --> 00:25:08,771
right.
He fought cotto awhile back and they 

555
00:25:08,771 --> 00:25:10,230
were doing the 24 slash seven and Koto 
the they cut from Kodo.

556
00:25:10,250 --> 00:25:11,900
He's like,
you know,

557
00:25:12,110 --> 00:25:17,110
I've been studying all his fights and I 
realized he's going to bring his best 

558
00:25:17,110 --> 00:25:18,680
and I'm going to bring my best and you 
know,

559
00:25:18,770 --> 00:25:23,770
we'll see what happens and they cut to 
Roger Mayweather Mayweather and he's 

560
00:25:23,770 --> 00:25:23,770
like kowtowing shit.

561
00:25:23,940 --> 00:25:28,820
That was just him.
Like he likes to watch any of his film.

562
00:25:28,821 --> 00:25:33,821
We don't have to.
His whole thing was that like we don't 

563
00:25:33,821 --> 00:25:34,580
prepare for other people.
They got to prepare for this shit.

564
00:25:35,130 --> 00:25:36,320
Man.
That was their philosophies,

565
00:25:36,321 --> 00:25:36,970
right?
Yeah.

566
00:25:37,070 --> 00:25:38,760
I mean he's right,
but he's Roger May,

567
00:25:38,761 --> 00:25:42,530
whether it has a quote that comes up on 
a mixed martial arts forums all the time

568
00:25:42,830 --> 00:25:46,460
that most people don't know shit about 
boxing and that's the video.

569
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:48,830
Most people don't know shit about 
boxing.

570
00:25:49,550 --> 00:25:52,550
I'm just played it over and every time 
people start talking about fights,

571
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:54,670
they put this play that Roger May with 
her clip.

572
00:25:54,680 --> 00:25:57,920
Most people don't know shit about boxing
the fucking Miguel cotto.

573
00:25:57,921 --> 00:26:02,921
I know fucking meme.
Most people don't know shit about 

574
00:26:05,001 --> 00:26:07,040
boxing.
It's true,

575
00:26:07,090 --> 00:26:12,090
I mean he's dead right.
Most people don't know shit about 

576
00:26:12,090 --> 00:26:14,591
boxing.
It's true because even if you look at 

577
00:26:14,591 --> 00:26:15,680
it,
you think you know what you're seeing.

578
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:17,630
You don't know what you're saying.
Yeah,

579
00:26:18,140 --> 00:26:19,250
that's true.
You look at it,

580
00:26:19,251 --> 00:26:19,790
you see,
well,

581
00:26:19,791 --> 00:26:22,190
this guy is trying to punch that guy and
this guy is trying to move his head.

582
00:26:22,430 --> 00:26:26,000
He sees things in melt multiple layers.
Definitely.

583
00:26:26,120 --> 00:26:28,900
He's seeing traps.
He seen setups.

584
00:26:28,910 --> 00:26:31,760
He's saying all sorts of different 
movements that you don't perceive.

585
00:26:31,761 --> 00:26:36,761
It's like us watching standup tricks and
you know,

586
00:26:37,401 --> 00:26:42,401
like somebody killing with a bullshit is
bullshit where the other people in that 

587
00:26:42,681 --> 00:26:44,100
room are like,
this guy's great.

588
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:49,640
You didn't know that.
Of course there was a guy that when I 

589
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:52,371
first started out I thought it was 
really good when I was an open mic or I 

590
00:26:52,371 --> 00:26:54,110
saw him live before I ever actually got 
onstage.

591
00:26:54,180 --> 00:26:57,870
I paid to see a show and he was on it 
and he had like the whole look.

592
00:26:58,110 --> 00:27:02,940
He had the converse all stars.
He had the gas station attendant jacket,

593
00:27:03,610 --> 00:27:08,610
kind of wacky.
Had the whole thing going on and this 

594
00:27:08,610 --> 00:27:11,890
just contrived nonsense act that was 
essentially pieced piece together with 

595
00:27:12,541 --> 00:27:15,420
every premise that you've ever heard 
from every comedian ever,

596
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:16,470
but I was like,
wow.

597
00:27:16,471 --> 00:27:18,460
He's a pro pro.
Yeah.

598
00:27:18,790 --> 00:27:20,610
Yeah.
The comedy tee shirt.

599
00:27:20,611 --> 00:27:22,820
That's always the giveaway.
The flames on it.

600
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:25,500
The flames are good,
but if I saw that guy today,

601
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:28,290
I would watch them for 30 seconds ago.
Oh God.

602
00:27:28,470 --> 00:27:30,540
Back.
I just saw one of those.

603
00:27:31,260 --> 00:27:32,790
Oh,
you were just working at the ice house.

604
00:27:33,310 --> 00:27:35,640
I saw.
I saw the ice house.

605
00:27:35,940 --> 00:27:38,430
Nice House on a weekend.
Gets robbed Wednesday night.

606
00:27:38,431 --> 00:27:41,730
It won't be roughed out.
Wednesday night.

607
00:27:42,030 --> 00:27:44,010
Brody Stevens,
Ian Edwards,

608
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:46,740
Duncan Trussell,
and Tony Tony Hinchcliffe.

609
00:27:46,770 --> 00:27:49,050
That's a good line.
That line and enjoy it.

610
00:27:49,260 --> 00:27:53,210
Eight one eight till I die.
Hang over.

611
00:27:53,310 --> 00:27:58,310
Yes.
Hang over to also push positive energy.

612
00:27:59,580 --> 00:28:03,240
If you've never seen bro.
I mean he's going to be great at the Ice

613
00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:05,400
House on Wednesday night,
but if you really want to see brody,

614
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:10,640
you got to see his late night set.
Is it a comedy store when he closes the 

615
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:14,391
room?
I have all these videos up on my 

616
00:28:14,391 --> 00:28:14,391
instagram of him playing the drums on 
chairs.

617
00:28:14,391 --> 00:28:17,220
He gives tambourines to people in the 
audience and they play along,

618
00:28:17,790 --> 00:28:19,110
man.
I basic.

619
00:28:19,111 --> 00:28:19,530
I didn't,
I,

620
00:28:19,560 --> 00:28:24,560
I barely knew him when Christina was on 
and writing for Chelsea on the show was 

621
00:28:25,801 --> 00:28:30,801
on the highlight.
I would laugh at her stories about he 

622
00:28:30,801 --> 00:28:32,220
was audience warmup,
but how he would wrangle these,

623
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:34,410
you know,
these 22 year old girls who were there,

624
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:39,640
there like about like energy,
energy go,

625
00:28:42,100 --> 00:28:44,150
go.
So when Chelsea comes out,

626
00:28:44,151 --> 00:28:49,151
she's real.
I need you to be real to laugh.

627
00:28:50,330 --> 00:28:52,460
And he would hear the audience laugh.
You would go.

628
00:28:52,550 --> 00:28:57,320
He would go like that.
It was,

629
00:28:57,350 --> 00:28:58,340
it was.
He was.

630
00:28:58,760 --> 00:29:00,380
No,
I can say this now because it's shown is

631
00:29:00,381 --> 00:29:05,381
no longer with that.
He was the funniest part or Chelsea 

632
00:29:05,381 --> 00:29:05,381
lately in my opinion.
They have while you were on it.

633
00:29:07,020 --> 00:29:11,040
Now when you're writing fucked up,
that's fucked up.

634
00:29:11,060 --> 00:29:13,790
He's a special man.
That dude is so funny.

635
00:29:13,850 --> 00:29:18,850
Well,
it's amazing that they didn't have him 

636
00:29:18,850 --> 00:29:18,850
on the shell like that.
You know?

637
00:29:18,850 --> 00:29:21,920
It's interesting.
He wasn't used correctly and I would 

638
00:29:21,920 --> 00:29:24,200
always advocate for that because I would
go to the writers and I go,

639
00:29:24,260 --> 00:29:29,260
we got to put him in sketches.
Why don't we do a thing where maybe we 

640
00:29:29,260 --> 00:29:30,520
take brody on blind dates or something 
like,

641
00:29:30,690 --> 00:29:31,520
let's end.

642
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:32,990
It was just.
It wasn't very popular.

643
00:29:32,991 --> 00:29:35,650
It was shot down.
Why don't know if he's an.

644
00:29:35,860 --> 00:29:39,500
Maybe he wasn't a fit for the television
audience at home,

645
00:29:39,560 --> 00:29:41,740
you know,
sensibility thing.

646
00:29:41,741 --> 00:29:45,970
I don't know.
I think he's so funny and so talented.

647
00:29:46,030 --> 00:29:51,030
I think whenever you start wondering 
whether or not the audience will like 

648
00:29:51,030 --> 00:29:51,030
someone,
you're fucked.

649
00:29:51,030 --> 00:29:51,880
You're fucked.
You're fucked.

650
00:29:52,390 --> 00:29:54,310
You like it.
Do you think it's funny?

651
00:29:54,550 --> 00:29:57,040
Then go with that.
Look at Tim and Eric.

652
00:29:57,250 --> 00:30:02,250
You ever watched him and Eric?
Those guys thought for a fucking second.

653
00:30:02,620 --> 00:30:03,940
Do you think the audience will like 
this?

654
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:04,810
Do you think?
Don't get it.

655
00:30:05,080 --> 00:30:07,050
The show would die.
It would be.

656
00:30:07,300 --> 00:30:09,070
It would never work.
It would never work.

657
00:30:09,130 --> 00:30:12,670
That show is so fucking crazy.
That one with the hillbillies.

658
00:30:12,700 --> 00:30:17,290
Tiny heads there and one guy got 
pregnant and I didn't see it.

659
00:30:17,420 --> 00:30:19,480
Oh my God.
So many good ones.

660
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:22,510
There's tiny hats.
I love tiny Hez tube.

661
00:30:22,550 --> 00:30:25,780
The poop poop poop.
Poop tube is might be my favorite of all

662
00:30:25,781 --> 00:30:27,760
time.
Are there songs like,

663
00:30:27,790 --> 00:30:29,590
here's what I do.
I sit on you.

664
00:30:30,170 --> 00:30:32,650
It's just a guy sitting on other 
people's heads.

665
00:30:34,430 --> 00:30:36,000
Ridiculous Shit.
There's.

666
00:30:36,030 --> 00:30:37,930
So what did you see?
Billion dollar movie?

667
00:30:38,230 --> 00:30:43,230
No,
through the first 10 minutes of that 

668
00:30:43,230 --> 00:30:45,481
movie,
I almost had a seizure because they have

669
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:47,770
a.
it's them.

670
00:30:47,771 --> 00:30:52,330
They made a movie that cost a billion 
dollars from a corporation,

671
00:30:52,570 --> 00:30:57,570
gave them a billion dollars and they 
plan them.

672
00:30:57,910 --> 00:31:02,910
Well,
they got to Johnny Depp look alike to 

673
00:31:02,910 --> 00:31:04,990
play Johnny Depp.
And he walks in and they have.

674
00:31:05,020 --> 00:31:07,380
What's that guy?
Alogia Robert Lowe?

675
00:31:07,710 --> 00:31:09,650
Yeah.
The old school gangster guy.

676
00:31:09,651 --> 00:31:13,120
Yes.
He plays the head of the corporation and

677
00:31:13,240 --> 00:31:18,240
this movie ends and it's just whore.
And he's sitting in this chair and he 

678
00:31:20,531 --> 00:31:22,520
goes,
what the fuck was that?

679
00:31:23,560 --> 00:31:28,560
He goes,
I paid a billion dollars for this piece 

680
00:31:28,560 --> 00:31:28,560
of shit.

681
00:31:28,560 --> 00:31:30,100
And then they come out and they have 
like a.

682
00:31:30,550 --> 00:31:31,870
Oh my God,
they have.

683
00:31:31,930 --> 00:31:34,150
Zach is like,
Zach plays their,

684
00:31:34,151 --> 00:31:35,620
um,
like their life advisor.

685
00:31:35,621 --> 00:31:40,621
There's spiritual coach and life advisor
and they just have like ridiculous 

686
00:31:40,621 --> 00:31:42,160
orange skin and fake teeth in and 
they're just like,

687
00:31:42,340 --> 00:31:45,070
we need that money to make the movie one
and it takes the most,

688
00:31:45,430 --> 00:31:48,180
takes up a thousand ridiculous turns,
but yeah,

689
00:31:48,181 --> 00:31:53,181
and I laughed my ass off at that.
Isn't that like kind of a perfect 

690
00:31:53,181 --> 00:31:56,290
example of like you have to,
you have to do what you like.

691
00:31:56,390 --> 00:32:01,390
It has to come course because you don't 
get a broody brody Stevens by doing a 

692
00:32:01,390 --> 00:32:01,390
poll.
Oh fuck.

693
00:32:01,390 --> 00:32:06,241
No.
You can't have like one of those things 

694
00:32:06,241 --> 00:32:06,850
where they have those focus groups where
they show a new television show.

695
00:32:06,940 --> 00:32:09,130
Oh,
you tested very high brody.

696
00:32:09,131 --> 00:32:11,920
We love when people say people love it 
when you say positive,

697
00:32:11,940 --> 00:32:12,650
right?
Right.

698
00:32:12,760 --> 00:32:13,770
Push.
Yeah.

699
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:14,830
They,
they're enjoying that.

700
00:32:14,950 --> 00:32:16,240
Enjoy it.
Enjoy it.

701
00:32:16,241 --> 00:32:17,460
Rated very highly.
Yeah.

702
00:32:17,520 --> 00:32:22,520
No tambourine.
He would take the camera and he would 

703
00:32:22,520 --> 00:32:25,231
just horrify these cute tiny,
tiny little girl came in their best 

704
00:32:25,231 --> 00:32:28,450
outfits to meet Chelsea handler their 
best album.

705
00:32:29,560 --> 00:32:30,970
This is.
I would only say this now,

706
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:34,000
after the fact,
I would go down to watch the warm up for

707
00:32:34,001 --> 00:32:36,470
taping and then I would disappear the 
minute the show.

708
00:32:39,700 --> 00:32:40,050
Oh

709
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:42,080
No,
if I wasn't on the panel.

710
00:32:42,180 --> 00:32:44,120
Oh my goodness.
Wow.

711
00:32:44,180 --> 00:32:45,920
That's.
Those were the days.

712
00:32:46,340 --> 00:32:47,870
What happened on that show?
Or one of the,

713
00:32:47,900 --> 00:32:52,900
what was it?
Fortune got us got to show and Chelsea 

714
00:32:52,900 --> 00:32:53,120
got upset at her.
I don't know that story.

715
00:32:53,121 --> 00:32:58,121
So fortunate actually replaced me.
I got fired and then I think I replaced 

716
00:32:58,121 --> 00:33:02,951
Jen Kirkman and then they brought John 
Kirkman back and then I think for tired 

717
00:33:02,951 --> 00:33:02,951
I.
Oh,

718
00:33:02,951 --> 00:33:03,130
I did.
Oh,

719
00:33:03,160 --> 00:33:07,340
what happened?
What happened was I was on the panel for

720
00:33:07,341 --> 00:33:12,341
like a year and change and then I being 
a writer without being a writer and then

721
00:33:13,731 --> 00:33:18,731
they,
Jen Kirkman was going to leave and they 

722
00:33:18,731 --> 00:33:18,780
asked me if I wanted to do it and uh,
you know,

723
00:33:18,830 --> 00:33:23,830
we were living in the Rampart division 
near Macarthur Park was not good.

724
00:33:26,630 --> 00:33:29,630
We lived in like a,
basically like we're needles meet,

725
00:33:29,631 --> 00:33:30,140
Bang,
Bang.

726
00:33:31,710 --> 00:33:36,590
A lot of heroin shopping and a lot of El
Salvadorian gangs.

727
00:33:36,620 --> 00:33:39,980
It was between 18th street and ms 13,
literally that gang territory.

728
00:33:40,490 --> 00:33:41,960
And so I was like,
absolutely,

729
00:33:41,961 --> 00:33:46,961
I'd love to write for the show,
like we had won the lottery and we kind 

730
00:33:46,961 --> 00:33:46,961
of did it.
Yeah,

731
00:33:46,961 --> 00:33:47,720
that was huge.
And it was,

732
00:33:47,750 --> 00:33:48,500
it was,
um,

733
00:33:48,560 --> 00:33:53,180
it was one of those jobs for sure.
It was huge.

734
00:33:53,570 --> 00:33:55,850
It was one of those Hollywood jobs where
I was supposed to,

735
00:33:56,040 --> 00:33:57,440
this is supposed to be the best thing 
ever.

736
00:33:57,710 --> 00:34:02,330
And then I would get my car and just cry
and after where it was just not for me,

737
00:34:02,360 --> 00:34:04,310
you know,
the environment was not for me.

738
00:34:04,340 --> 00:34:06,170
It just wasn't my,
it wasn't my jam.

739
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:10,790
I didn't jibe with the culture.
It's just like what was off about it?

740
00:34:11,540 --> 00:34:14,180
It's um,
a little bit of a,

741
00:34:15,380 --> 00:34:20,380
you know,
how in writer's rooms there's like a 

742
00:34:20,380 --> 00:34:20,380
yes,
and you feel like,

743
00:34:20,380 --> 00:34:20,380
oh,
hey,

744
00:34:20,520 --> 00:34:22,650
let's do that and we'll top that with 
that.

745
00:34:23,450 --> 00:34:25,790
There was,
I didn't sense that energy.

746
00:34:25,791 --> 00:34:29,090
It was more mean girl energy.
Know what I'm saying.

747
00:34:29,091 --> 00:34:33,080
Like I think you put a bunch of chicks 
together and that might just happen.

748
00:34:33,081 --> 00:34:35,410
Not all the time,
but mean girl.

749
00:34:36,020 --> 00:34:37,640
A little bit of that.
It just,

750
00:34:37,641 --> 00:34:39,290
I didn't,
I didn't jive.

751
00:34:39,291 --> 00:34:41,870
It's like in high school,
you know,

752
00:34:41,871 --> 00:34:44,120
hung out with the goths,
put it this way.

753
00:34:44,121 --> 00:34:47,570
If I go to a restaurant when I worked 
actually when I worked in restaurants,

754
00:34:47,630 --> 00:34:50,510
I'm more likely to hang out with the 
busboys than with the managers,

755
00:34:51,500 --> 00:34:53,660
but just that,
that's my energy.

756
00:34:53,810 --> 00:34:58,810
And they were managers.
I guess I'm trying to decipher this well

757
00:34:59,961 --> 00:35:04,961
because you know,
I don't want to be under the bus 

758
00:35:04,961 --> 00:35:06,890
shithead about it,
but they were more into being mean.

759
00:35:06,920 --> 00:35:09,260
The culture wasn't for me.
It wasn't for me.

760
00:35:09,430 --> 00:35:12,140
It wasn't a good match dude.
It just wasn't my energy.

761
00:35:12,350 --> 00:35:14,310
I understand what you're saying.
So,

762
00:35:14,330 --> 00:35:14,780
so anyway.
Yeah.

763
00:35:14,781 --> 00:35:17,780
So I got fired pretty quick,
I think like a month and a half,

764
00:35:18,710 --> 00:35:23,710
month and a half.
And the best part is they call me into 

765
00:35:23,710 --> 00:35:25,310
the [inaudible] office and he's like,
we're going to have to let you go.

766
00:35:25,370 --> 00:35:27,590
And I started laughing because I thought
he was joking.

767
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:31,060
I thought it was a break.
It wasn't a wow.

768
00:35:31,310 --> 00:35:32,990
What did they say?
Uh,

769
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:36,260
you know,
the usual Hollywood bullshit.

770
00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:37,980
We,
we already have your

771
00:35:37,980 --> 00:35:40,300
voice on the show.
Oh God,

772
00:35:40,670 --> 00:35:45,670
that kind of talk.
Just tell me you didn't like what I was 

773
00:35:45,670 --> 00:35:46,920
doing or feel we already had your voice.
Fuck,

774
00:35:46,980 --> 00:35:48,450
is that.
Oh my God,

775
00:35:48,451 --> 00:35:51,750
that Gobbly Gook talk drives me fucking 
bananas.

776
00:35:51,900 --> 00:35:52,590
Well,
there you go.

777
00:35:52,680 --> 00:35:56,880
And that's the kind of Gobbledygook.
Some guy came up to me at the Improv and

778
00:35:56,881 --> 00:35:58,890
gave me gobbly gook.
Talked the other night.

779
00:35:59,160 --> 00:36:01,500
You've done an amazing job with your 
brand.

780
00:36:03,420 --> 00:36:06,270
We're done.
We're done with my brand.

781
00:36:06,271 --> 00:36:08,050
What?
That fucking sucks though.

782
00:36:08,070 --> 00:36:13,070
That's how that guy was.
He like works in unsuccessfully.

783
00:36:14,030 --> 00:36:16,140
Oh really?
Successful worker comic.

784
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:17,850
Well,
he's a producer guy,

785
00:36:17,851 --> 00:36:19,200
but you know what I mean?
Like those guys,

786
00:36:19,201 --> 00:36:23,010
they adopt that lingo.
They adopt that way of talking.

787
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:28,040
The grossest part about that is that 
that's always attached to an idea of I 

788
00:36:28,040 --> 00:36:31,080
would like a part of this.
Like there's always like,

789
00:36:31,110 --> 00:36:36,110
how can I kind of weasel into sucking 
some of what you have achieved for me 

790
00:36:37,951 --> 00:36:39,390
too.
There was a little of that talk,

791
00:36:39,391 --> 00:36:41,940
but I was so unresponsive.
I think it died off,

792
00:36:41,970 --> 00:36:43,140
you know,
I think there's.

793
00:36:43,230 --> 00:36:48,150
I think one of the things they'll say is
there's money left on the table.

794
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:53,960
Have you ever heard that one?
Some money still left on the table and 

795
00:36:53,960 --> 00:36:55,440
I'd love to be able to sit down with you
and figure out how to optimize that.

796
00:36:55,441 --> 00:36:56,810
I think there's some ways we can do 
that.

797
00:36:56,950 --> 00:36:58,830
Circle back later and put a pin in.
It.

798
00:37:02,330 --> 00:37:05,640
Blew my brains out,
shoot it over to me.

799
00:37:05,670 --> 00:37:07,730
I'll shoot it back.
Well,

800
00:37:07,740 --> 00:37:10,170
this business is so weird because this 
business,

801
00:37:10,200 --> 00:37:15,200
a big part of this business is quote 
unquote the talent and then there's a 

802
00:37:16,081 --> 00:37:18,110
bunch of people that try to figure out 
how.

803
00:37:18,140 --> 00:37:20,870
Find that talent and then pimp it,
right?

804
00:37:21,300 --> 00:37:26,300
Send that,
send that talent out into the world and 

805
00:37:26,300 --> 00:37:26,300
make money off of it.
Yeah.

806
00:37:26,300 --> 00:37:30,030
So it's this weird like I'm your friend.
Let's work together.

807
00:37:30,031 --> 00:37:35,031
I'm your producer.
I would love to be an a project with 

808
00:37:35,031 --> 00:37:35,610
you.
And what they're doing is just trying to

809
00:37:35,620 --> 00:37:36,630
fit.
They don't have any talent.

810
00:37:36,840 --> 00:37:38,700
They're trying to figure out.
All they have to do is just like,

811
00:37:38,701 --> 00:37:39,270
you know,
Mike,

812
00:37:39,271 --> 00:37:42,380
you have to be here at seven to do with 
the fucking catering and you know,

813
00:37:42,390 --> 00:37:46,570
bob turned that camera on,
pointed at this guy when she talks,

814
00:37:46,571 --> 00:37:47,650
you need to have her mic.

815
00:37:49,100 --> 00:37:50,890
That's what they do.
Part of the lights on to.

816
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:56,040
So this helps.
So they're always trying to figure out 

817
00:37:56,040 --> 00:37:58,401
how to say the right words to Kinda like
ingratiate themselves and have it be 

818
00:37:59,161 --> 00:38:01,720
real smooth hand jobbing.
Yeah.

819
00:38:01,730 --> 00:38:05,220
They want to be real smooth and how they
talk to you.

820
00:38:05,320 --> 00:38:07,290
I really enjoy what you're doing with 
your brand,

821
00:38:07,291 --> 00:38:12,291
Christina.
I think you've done an amazing job or 

822
00:38:12,291 --> 00:38:13,950
manager.
I used to have a manager that talked and

823
00:38:14,030 --> 00:38:18,300
manager speak where they never really 
give you a decisive answer like,

824
00:38:18,301 --> 00:38:19,920
hey man,
should I take this thing or not?

825
00:38:20,550 --> 00:38:25,550
I mean it's a bird in the hand,
but on the other hand if you're not 

826
00:38:25,550 --> 00:38:25,550
happy with or the new.
Yeah.

827
00:38:25,550 --> 00:38:25,550
And you're like,
dude,

828
00:38:25,550 --> 00:38:26,900
just what does that mean?
What do you mean?

829
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:32,000
Remember when your first,
like when you don't have a manager and 

830
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:32,190
you think that getting a manager would 
be everything.

831
00:38:32,340 --> 00:38:37,340
Everything that I remember a guy came to
a show at the Hollywood improv and he 

832
00:38:40,151 --> 00:38:42,100
like just was like,
you're,

833
00:38:42,101 --> 00:38:44,770
this is incredible what you're doing.
And then to he.

834
00:38:44,860 --> 00:38:47,710
And he told me that and then he,
he shit on another client of his.

835
00:38:49,210 --> 00:38:54,210
He was like,
you're so much better than this other 

836
00:38:54,210 --> 00:38:54,210
guy that I managed.
I was like,

837
00:38:54,210 --> 00:38:54,210
oh,
that's not good.

838
00:38:54,210 --> 00:38:54,930
And then he goes,
I'm gonna,

839
00:38:55,300 --> 00:38:58,840
I need to bring other guys from my 
company to watch you.

840
00:38:59,480 --> 00:39:00,920
Uh,
like I'm,

841
00:39:00,970 --> 00:39:02,560
I'm sold on you,
but I need to show them.

842
00:39:03,250 --> 00:39:04,300
And then I was like,
okay.

843
00:39:04,360 --> 00:39:09,360
So then we'd set up another show.
He brought like four guys from this big 

844
00:39:09,360 --> 00:39:10,510
company and then after that show they 
were like,

845
00:39:10,511 --> 00:39:11,170
great,
great.

846
00:39:11,580 --> 00:39:16,580
And then I talked to him on Monday.
It was like a weekend show and he's 

847
00:39:16,580 --> 00:39:16,580
like,
just don't think it's going to work out.

848
00:39:16,580 --> 00:39:17,430
Right.
It's just not,

849
00:39:17,800 --> 00:39:18,910
it's just not a fit.

850
00:39:21,340 --> 00:39:23,080
What's the fit?
You got lucky.

851
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:28,400
Yeah,
I really did because I would've fucking 

852
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:28,400
ran into that.
Should immediately.

853
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:28,400
Yeah,
you got lucky.

854
00:39:28,490 --> 00:39:31,810
You know you can get trapped in a bad 
manager early on.

855
00:39:31,811 --> 00:39:35,220
Then they sue you when you leave or you 
have a lawsuit.

856
00:39:35,221 --> 00:39:37,180
If.
Especially if anything happens,

857
00:39:37,420 --> 00:39:42,420
if you have a television show or 
something takes off and it becomes 

858
00:39:42,420 --> 00:39:43,060
successful.
Manager is like,

859
00:39:43,660 --> 00:39:45,660
I have the best manager of all.
I was about to say,

860
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,970
I love your guys' relationship.
You guys are cool together,

861
00:39:48,971 --> 00:39:51,040
man.
That's so sussman and Shandra.

862
00:39:51,790 --> 00:39:53,290
They're the best.
They're the best.

863
00:39:53,291 --> 00:39:55,120
They're my friends.
They're like really good friends.

864
00:39:55,300 --> 00:39:59,290
Jeff has been with me since I was 24.
Yeah,

865
00:39:59,320 --> 00:40:00,060
we,
he still,

866
00:40:00,280 --> 00:40:02,680
he found me when I was an open mic or 
essentially.

867
00:40:02,950 --> 00:40:07,950
I mean I was like maybe I was just 
getting a little bit of work but 

868
00:40:07,950 --> 00:40:07,950
basically sucked.

869
00:40:07,950 --> 00:40:12,390
You know when I talked to Shandra,
I forget that I'm talking to somebody 

870
00:40:12,390 --> 00:40:14,920
that works like I just talked to her.
Like a friend.

871
00:40:15,020 --> 00:40:15,660
Yeah,
she's.

872
00:40:15,870 --> 00:40:18,190
She is normal.
Totally normal.

873
00:40:18,250 --> 00:40:21,430
You heard me talking to her.
She really cares.

874
00:40:21,431 --> 00:40:23,000
Yeah.
We're talking about the next time.

875
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:26,320
They're so rare.
People like her and Jeff,

876
00:40:26,321 --> 00:40:28,420
they're so rare,
but jeff is,

877
00:40:28,630 --> 00:40:30,400
he's,
we're so close.

878
00:40:30,760 --> 00:40:34,660
I mean he's been with me from the 
beginning of my career and I like that.

879
00:40:34,990 --> 00:40:35,610
Yeah,
it's,

880
00:40:35,620 --> 00:40:38,650
well for me it's giant because I never 
have to worry about a manager.

881
00:40:38,910 --> 00:40:40,660
Like I never have to worry about that 
nonsense.

882
00:40:40,661 --> 00:40:45,661
I could pass it off to jeff and I trust 
him the way I would like more than I 

883
00:40:45,661 --> 00:40:46,020
trust myself,
you know,

884
00:40:46,021 --> 00:40:47,470
it's like give it to him,
he'll handle it,

885
00:40:47,780 --> 00:40:48,730
you know,
he just knows how to.

886
00:40:48,940 --> 00:40:53,940
He knows how to deal with stuff and he's
always been great from the very 

887
00:40:53,940 --> 00:40:53,940
beginning.

888
00:40:53,940 --> 00:40:56,440
But you could get a bad one man.
And then off to the.

889
00:40:56,630 --> 00:40:57,880
I've seen it.
I'm like,

890
00:40:57,970 --> 00:41:00,460
I've been with the same guy eight years 
and we have a good relationship and I'm,

891
00:41:00,500 --> 00:41:02,110
I'm happy with that.
Like it's cool,

892
00:41:02,230 --> 00:41:07,230
but I have friends that have been with 
in that eight year span had been with 

893
00:41:07,230 --> 00:41:10,471
like five,
six managers like friends of ours that 

894
00:41:10,471 --> 00:41:12,070
you're fired this guy.
I fired somebody else.

895
00:41:12,071 --> 00:41:16,990
I find a good fit.
And a lot of times they're both fucked.

896
00:41:17,140 --> 00:41:20,170
The manager's fucked and the comic is 
fuck to fuck there.

897
00:41:20,171 --> 00:41:22,480
Everyone's fucked up trying to figure it
out.

898
00:41:22,481 --> 00:41:24,940
No one could figure it out.
I don't know if this is true or not,

899
00:41:25,300 --> 00:41:30,300
so I don't want to say the name,
but apparently mark Merrin's podcast 

900
00:41:30,300 --> 00:41:34,620
before he started his podcast,
his manager was telling why you fucking 

901
00:41:34,620 --> 00:41:34,620
waste your time doing this.

902
00:41:34,700 --> 00:41:37,970
I don't want to say it like that,
so I'm sure it is true.

903
00:41:38,150 --> 00:41:41,020
I don't want to say his name,
but he just interviewed the president,

904
00:41:41,021 --> 00:41:46,021
so how fucking stupid as fucking stupid.
This his ex manager field now.

905
00:41:46,280 --> 00:41:48,290
It's so crazy.
It's so crazy.

906
00:41:48,320 --> 00:41:49,580
Oops,
you missed it.

907
00:41:49,581 --> 00:41:51,140
So great.
It's so crazy.

908
00:41:51,170 --> 00:41:53,540
Nobody saw the podcast thing coming in 
his defense,

909
00:41:53,750 --> 00:41:56,540
but what a terrible way to address 
something like that saying,

910
00:41:56,541 --> 00:41:58,100
oh well why are you doing this on the 
Internet?

911
00:41:58,480 --> 00:42:00,260
But you had a manager.
Who Was it?

912
00:42:00,440 --> 00:42:01,190
No,
no,

913
00:42:01,250 --> 00:42:02,390
no.
I'll tell you what happened.

914
00:42:05,330 --> 00:42:07,680
I had a club owner.
Oh No.

915
00:42:08,060 --> 00:42:13,060
Very early in my career.
I talk like this Buddy Buddy Christina 

916
00:42:14,810 --> 00:42:19,810
ski boat came,
say name this and this is only one way 

917
00:42:19,810 --> 00:42:22,070
to get to the top.
You have to become,

918
00:42:22,590 --> 00:42:25,520
we need a gimmick.
You want to Polish power,

919
00:42:25,990 --> 00:42:29,170
power,
power,

920
00:42:29,210 --> 00:42:30,760
and I wore like a swastika.
No,

921
00:42:32,360 --> 00:42:33,440
he,
he goes,

922
00:42:33,441 --> 00:42:37,700
storm trooper outfit.
Hi Girl.

923
00:42:37,710 --> 00:42:41,510
Mustache high boots.
He was so he pulled me aside.

924
00:42:41,511 --> 00:42:43,500
This is year four and stand up and he's 
like,

925
00:42:43,660 --> 00:42:46,370
you know,
got a good looking girl.

926
00:42:46,580 --> 00:42:50,270
Maybe you should do smart though.
Do you write your own material?

927
00:42:50,271 --> 00:42:51,200
I was like,
yeah man,

928
00:42:51,260 --> 00:42:53,090
I wasn't that smart at the time.
Of course.

929
00:42:53,180 --> 00:42:53,820
I'm sure it.
Yeah.

930
00:42:54,320 --> 00:42:56,860
And he's like,
you should be like a naive,

931
00:42:56,861 --> 00:42:59,190
like a stupid blonde,
like an ingenue.

932
00:42:59,510 --> 00:43:01,280
And I was like,
I gotta go bro.

933
00:43:03,590 --> 00:43:04,930
Thankfully.
But you don't know.

934
00:43:04,940 --> 00:43:06,290
You're still vulnerable in the 
beginning.

935
00:43:06,291 --> 00:43:07,970
Someone tells you something and you 
think,

936
00:43:07,971 --> 00:43:08,690
oh,
maybe I should.

937
00:43:08,691 --> 00:43:10,190
Listen.
This guy knows what he's talking about.

938
00:43:10,220 --> 00:43:12,860
The sad part is that some people don't 
at that point go,

939
00:43:12,920 --> 00:43:14,210
okay,
uh,

940
00:43:14,220 --> 00:43:19,220
I'm going to stick to what I think.
I'm going to listen to this fucking 

941
00:43:19,220 --> 00:43:19,220
idiot.
You're so new to it,

942
00:43:19,220 --> 00:43:24,070
of course are so green and you think,
well this is a person write books,

943
00:43:24,651 --> 00:43:28,290
the biggest talent in the world.
And then boy,

944
00:43:28,291 --> 00:43:30,530
oh boy.
What did you glad I didn't listen to the

945
00:43:30,531 --> 00:43:31,580
advice?
Oh God,

946
00:43:31,640 --> 00:43:33,860
when I lived in Boston they were all 
telling me to be clean.

947
00:43:33,920 --> 00:43:36,640
Like you have to be cleaned from the 
beginning.

948
00:43:36,680 --> 00:43:37,340
Got To be clean.
You're,

949
00:43:37,341 --> 00:43:38,750
you're,
you're taking shortcuts.

950
00:43:39,160 --> 00:43:40,740
That was the big thing that you're 
taking shortcuts,

951
00:43:40,760 --> 00:43:41,420
right?
Because you,

952
00:43:41,540 --> 00:43:46,540
because you talk like a normal person 
maybe back in the day when the only 

953
00:43:46,540 --> 00:43:51,161
outlets for standup where you know the 
tonight show star search and that was 

954
00:43:51,161 --> 00:43:51,170
it.

955
00:43:51,170 --> 00:43:54,200
And now with the Internet and cable,
I mean kids definitely.

956
00:43:54,230 --> 00:43:59,230
It's definitely,
there's definitely more outlets but 

957
00:43:59,230 --> 00:43:59,230
there was always nightclubs back then 
and the,

958
00:43:59,230 --> 00:44:00,500
those,
the what they would call dirty material,

959
00:44:00,501 --> 00:44:01,220
you know,
swearing,

960
00:44:01,221 --> 00:44:04,310
whatever it worked.
It was in fact funny.

961
00:44:04,490 --> 00:44:07,100
So like this idea that it has to be 
clean to be,

962
00:44:07,340 --> 00:44:08,900
to be good.
I was just like,

963
00:44:08,901 --> 00:44:13,901
I don't understand.
What you're saying to me is that if I 

964
00:44:13,901 --> 00:44:15,260
don't,
if I don't censor myself,

965
00:44:15,350 --> 00:44:17,990
because that's the only,
like what you're seeing on television is

966
00:44:17,991 --> 00:44:20,120
censored so that they can sell 
commercials.

967
00:44:20,450 --> 00:44:21,550
That's all it is.
Yeah.

968
00:44:21,710 --> 00:44:24,350
So if you don't make a commercial 
product like that,

969
00:44:24,351 --> 00:44:26,000
then you're.
You're taking a shortcut,

970
00:44:26,150 --> 00:44:27,980
but what about all the things that 
happen in your brain?

971
00:44:27,981 --> 00:44:29,570
You do think about sex,
right?

972
00:44:29,780 --> 00:44:32,100
You do think about these so those things

973
00:44:32,100 --> 00:44:33,780
aren't valid.
Those are not valid,

974
00:44:33,781 --> 00:44:35,610
but that doesn't make any sense.
Well,

975
00:44:35,611 --> 00:44:40,611
it always kills me when you're not 
allowed to discuss adult topics among 

976
00:44:40,611 --> 00:44:45,381
adults or speak the way adults do.
You guys are so offended by jerk off or 

977
00:44:46,850 --> 00:44:48,870
this or that.
Like give me a fucking break.

978
00:44:49,200 --> 00:44:50,970
It's so nice.
It makes me crazy.

979
00:44:50,971 --> 00:44:53,670
Yeah,
those people are dumb.

980
00:44:53,671 --> 00:44:55,350
They're dumb.
They are smart.

981
00:44:55,840 --> 00:44:59,070
They're the problem and they think 
there's something wrong with you.

982
00:44:59,460 --> 00:45:02,490
I just prefer more highbrow type of 
comment for you.

983
00:45:03,230 --> 00:45:03,930
Good for you.
You know what?

984
00:45:03,931 --> 00:45:08,931
I always wonder,
doing the shit holes that I did as a 

985
00:45:08,931 --> 00:45:08,931
feature act.
You know,

986
00:45:08,931 --> 00:45:12,380
I've been down in Florida doing seafood 
restaurants and buy ge grills.

987
00:45:12,670 --> 00:45:16,170
Like how did a guy like Seinfeld come up
with an act?

988
00:45:16,500 --> 00:45:17,130
You know,
you know,

989
00:45:17,131 --> 00:45:22,131
those hard knocks first days.
Like how do you crush it at the late 

990
00:45:22,131 --> 00:45:25,191
show Friday with like you ever notice?
So the paper towels are crinkly and do 

991
00:45:25,351 --> 00:45:27,150
that because I have reverted 
immediately.

992
00:45:27,610 --> 00:45:32,610
I took a shit today.
Let's check off into the just because I 

993
00:45:32,610 --> 00:45:33,790
wanted to survive under the jail.

994
00:45:36,210 --> 00:45:37,720
I just want it to be.
No,

995
00:45:37,960 --> 00:45:42,420
it's survival.
So when I did a show recently,

996
00:45:42,630 --> 00:45:45,840
I was watching this all this shit like 
ahead of me and I was like,

997
00:45:45,841 --> 00:45:49,470
this is a dog shit show and it's getting
later and later and you know,

998
00:45:49,680 --> 00:45:52,350
there's some heckling going on and you 
put on like you're like,

999
00:45:52,560 --> 00:45:57,560
all right,
I'm going to go up there like ready for 

1000
00:45:57,560 --> 00:45:57,560
that.
And a weird show.

1001
00:45:57,560 --> 00:46:02,231
It happened to not go that way.
Like I was able to just do regular 

1002
00:46:02,231 --> 00:46:02,610
standup.
Well the show that we were talking about

1003
00:46:02,611 --> 00:46:04,200
earlier,
but this weekend.

1004
00:46:04,201 --> 00:46:04,770
Yeah.
Yeah.

1005
00:46:04,800 --> 00:46:09,800
But what ended up happening was that 
they actually ended up being great 

1006
00:46:09,800 --> 00:46:14,091
audience and I could just do standup,
but what I'm talking about is that in 

1007
00:46:14,091 --> 00:46:15,390
those times,
that late show,

1008
00:46:15,760 --> 00:46:20,760
I would always have the hardest hitting 
stuff ready to go because for like a 

1009
00:46:20,791 --> 00:46:21,820
fear thing,
you're like,

1010
00:46:22,290 --> 00:46:23,610
they're going to eat me alive.

1011
00:46:23,820 --> 00:46:26,580
And Yeah,
I dunno how early on the fear,

1012
00:46:26,830 --> 00:46:31,830
how,
how a clean super clean act would get 

1013
00:46:31,830 --> 00:46:31,830
through those,
those little,

1014
00:46:32,300 --> 00:46:37,020
the balls at such a young stage in your 
development to be like,

1015
00:46:37,021 --> 00:46:38,410
no,
I'm going to stick to my,

1016
00:46:38,940 --> 00:46:40,740
my hand washing jokes.
Fuck you.

1017
00:46:40,780 --> 00:46:45,780
Because Gaffigan had,
I was told had like dirty stuff billing 

1018
00:46:46,510 --> 00:46:46,950
for.
Yeah,

1019
00:46:46,951 --> 00:46:49,680
for a while.
And then he only went clean,

1020
00:46:49,681 --> 00:46:51,450
you know,
I don't know how many years ago now.

1021
00:46:51,750 --> 00:46:53,950
And he does fucking huge,
you know,

1022
00:46:54,060 --> 00:46:58,170
theaters and arenas now he's clean act.
But I think when he was doing the clubs,

1023
00:46:58,171 --> 00:46:59,650
he had dirty stuff like,
you know,

1024
00:46:59,670 --> 00:47:00,630
10,
12 years ago.

1025
00:47:00,690 --> 00:47:01,840
That's interesting.
I wonder how,

1026
00:47:02,640 --> 00:47:05,330
I wonder what,
what flips the switch with guys with,

1027
00:47:05,420 --> 00:47:07,340
with women.
Brilliant.

1028
00:47:08,040 --> 00:47:09,450
Hilarious.
He's a great guy too.

1029
00:47:09,451 --> 00:47:10,680
He's really funny.
On the podcast,

1030
00:47:11,160 --> 00:47:15,420
but it's like that thing where you 
decide like I am not going to do this is

1031
00:47:15,421 --> 00:47:16,770
my niche.
Yeah.

1032
00:47:17,520 --> 00:47:20,100
Like Brian Regan.
Hilarious.

1033
00:47:20,550 --> 00:47:21,870
Hilarious.
But that's his.

1034
00:47:22,680 --> 00:47:24,420
He's locked into that,
that niche.

1035
00:47:24,570 --> 00:47:26,340
There's some guys too.
I think a lot.

1036
00:47:26,450 --> 00:47:30,070
Some of them look at those things

1037
00:47:30,070 --> 00:47:31,860
like a challenge in a way,
you know,

1038
00:47:31,870 --> 00:47:36,870
like how can I craft this where it's 
stays pure or something for some reason 

1039
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:43,000
and,
and finding without going into that 

1040
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:45,541
language,
I think they see it like an it 

1041
00:47:45,541 --> 00:47:45,541
challenge.
Oh,

1042
00:47:45,541 --> 00:47:48,781
I see what you're saying.
But they've naturally got to be pretty 

1043
00:47:48,781 --> 00:47:48,910
clean dudes.
Like isn't Gavigan kind of a norm?

1044
00:47:48,911 --> 00:47:49,810
But I,
I've,

1045
00:47:50,110 --> 00:47:55,110
I've heard and I've seen like on 
interview stuff like Seinfeld for 

1046
00:47:55,110 --> 00:47:55,930
instance,
curses in his,

1047
00:47:56,510 --> 00:47:57,640
you know,
regular life.

1048
00:47:57,730 --> 00:47:59,160
Yeah.
He curses in interviews.

1049
00:47:59,440 --> 00:48:02,730
So does Jay Leno Leno's curses a lot,
you know,

1050
00:48:02,740 --> 00:48:04,760
when you're hanging out with Jay Leno 
really fucking high.

1051
00:48:05,050 --> 00:48:07,260
Yeah.
He's always swearing but onstage whereas

1052
00:48:07,340 --> 00:48:08,530
the storm.
Oh yeah.

1053
00:48:08,531 --> 00:48:12,220
It's interesting because I was just 
thinking about this like in my day

1054
00:48:13,340 --> 00:48:18,340
because Hailey curses when you're 
unconscious curses,

1055
00:48:22,210 --> 00:48:27,210
when he's on Viagra,
you're on whatever the fuck your 

1056
00:48:27,210 --> 00:48:30,160
expertise and your rudy.
Then he's going to talk about a double 

1057
00:48:30,160 --> 00:48:32,530
identity on the stage of identity being 
completely different.

1058
00:48:32,560 --> 00:48:33,850
What the fuck,
man?

1059
00:48:33,880 --> 00:48:37,120
That guy who saw that coming?
I did.

1060
00:48:37,330 --> 00:48:42,330
Did you just get like a serial rapist?
I had that one page knew it,

1061
00:48:43,510 --> 00:48:45,190
knew it.
He called it,

1062
00:48:45,490 --> 00:48:50,170
but I do have a theory.
I think that I always find it weird when

1063
00:48:50,171 --> 00:48:52,450
male comics don't talk about their dicks
on stage.

1064
00:48:52,451 --> 00:48:54,980
Okay.
I do because I don't trust the.

1065
00:48:54,981 --> 00:48:59,981
I don't.
I don't trust the dudes that don't 

1066
00:48:59,981 --> 00:48:59,981
because I think there's some dishonesty 
there.

1067
00:48:59,981 --> 00:48:59,981
I got.
I got to tell you,

1068
00:48:59,981 --> 00:49:02,770
a guy that doesn't talk about his Dick 
and jerking and all that stuff.

1069
00:49:03,280 --> 00:49:04,420
I just,
I personally,

1070
00:49:04,421 --> 00:49:08,650
I go sell something.
It's not on the level.

1071
00:49:08,651 --> 00:49:10,150
There's,
there's something being hidden.

1072
00:49:10,600 --> 00:49:11,590
Yeah.
Yeah.

1073
00:49:11,800 --> 00:49:13,450
Well,
I think people have have

1074
00:49:13,450 --> 00:49:16,660
different styles of comedy that they 
like to,

1075
00:49:16,900 --> 00:49:21,900
like maybe they grew up watching like a 
Seinfeld or watching that kind of like 

1076
00:49:21,900 --> 00:49:25,960
real clean tonight show style comedy and
that's what they enjoy.

1077
00:49:26,390 --> 00:49:31,390
They enjoy being buttoned down and then 
being tied up and literally weird shit.

1078
00:49:33,340 --> 00:49:34,810
But I was thinking about music,
you know,

1079
00:49:34,811 --> 00:49:37,060
like my favorite songs don't have swears
in them.

1080
00:49:37,480 --> 00:49:38,700
Right.
Yeah.

1081
00:49:38,710 --> 00:49:43,710
I mean start by thinking about it like 
the stones or Hendrix or something like 

1082
00:49:43,710 --> 00:49:43,710
that.
Like that's my favorite kind of music.

1083
00:49:43,710 --> 00:49:48,661
I love classic sixties music.
There's no swears at very few in any of 

1084
00:49:49,121 --> 00:49:54,121
those songs.
Is that because of the radio and they 

1085
00:49:54,121 --> 00:49:54,121
have to play it.
Yeah,

1086
00:49:54,121 --> 00:49:54,121
I'm sure.
But you know,

1087
00:49:54,121 --> 00:49:56,580
still some fucking amazing songs.
Yeah.

1088
00:49:56,590 --> 00:49:57,490
Amazing.
Amazing.

1089
00:49:57,670 --> 00:50:00,750
Do you want to not curse or something 
though and onstage or you know,

1090
00:50:00,820 --> 00:50:05,820
in rap music,
obviously that's flooded with swears 

1091
00:50:05,820 --> 00:50:07,480
like in some of my favorite rap songs 
just littered with swears.

1092
00:50:07,481 --> 00:50:08,520
Yeah.
You know?

1093
00:50:09,110 --> 00:50:10,300
Yeah.
But some of the great,

1094
00:50:10,360 --> 00:50:13,240
great songs,
don't you know,

1095
00:50:13,270 --> 00:50:15,220
some,
some of them don't swear a lot.

1096
00:50:15,270 --> 00:50:18,340
See that,
that made,

1097
00:50:19,330 --> 00:50:20,800
that,
made that by hand.

1098
00:50:20,801 --> 00:50:22,060
Come on,
glasses.

1099
00:50:22,150 --> 00:50:22,930
Come off.
Look at that.

1100
00:50:23,170 --> 00:50:28,170
Oh,
look at the detail of hells.

1101
00:50:29,630 --> 00:50:31,640
Yeah,
that's really cool.

1102
00:50:31,641 --> 00:50:33,830
But like biggie stuff,
it's filled with sweat.

1103
00:50:33,910 --> 00:50:38,910
So much dirtiness and all the story 
about shitting on a girl's chest dumps 

1104
00:50:40,760 --> 00:50:43,550
too.
Lord,

1105
00:50:44,240 --> 00:50:45,200
after his,
uh,

1106
00:50:45,320 --> 00:50:50,320
his steak and eggs breakfast and she 
asked me to shoot all those thoughts to 

1107
00:50:56,610 --> 00:50:58,360
say it like that.
It's a,

1108
00:50:58,370 --> 00:50:59,630
it's a,
it's like one of those inner.

1109
00:50:59,870 --> 00:51:01,870
The interludes are the worst part of 
rapid.

1110
00:51:02,630 --> 00:51:04,220
He listened to the song and then it's 
like,

1111
00:51:04,221 --> 00:51:05,920
I'm listening to this ghostface album.
Then he's,

1112
00:51:06,020 --> 00:51:06,530
she's like,
yeah,

1113
00:51:06,531 --> 00:51:07,540
wash my balls.
Right.

1114
00:51:07,541 --> 00:51:08,070
And they're like,
dude,

1115
00:51:08,180 --> 00:51:11,290
I can't play in front of people.
I can play the alone.

1116
00:51:11,300 --> 00:51:12,710
It's just weird.
Yeah.

1117
00:51:12,711 --> 00:51:14,360
There's all those interludes or like,
you know,

1118
00:51:14,390 --> 00:51:16,650
either shooting somebody like that I 
killed his,

1119
00:51:16,651 --> 00:51:19,700
this motherfucker or it's like she asked
me to shit on her,

1120
00:51:20,030 --> 00:51:21,330
suck my Dick Bitch.
And they.

1121
00:51:21,331 --> 00:51:22,530
Yeah.
It's all good stuff.

1122
00:51:24,620 --> 00:51:27,500
That's all crazy.
It's weird how rap music is.

1123
00:51:27,501 --> 00:51:30,950
Like the first music we're swears or 
mandatory almost.

1124
00:51:31,370 --> 00:51:32,180
Pretty much,
I mean,

1125
00:51:32,181 --> 00:51:34,170
yeah,
diggable planets,

1126
00:51:35,160 --> 00:51:37,000
planets.
What does that planets.

1127
00:51:37,001 --> 00:51:37,770
They were like,
oh,

1128
00:51:38,120 --> 00:51:38,720
right,
right,

1129
00:51:38,721 --> 00:51:39,260
right.
Well,

1130
00:51:39,261 --> 00:51:40,870
de la soul is pretty clean,
right?

1131
00:51:41,170 --> 00:51:42,800
They were great.
A door.

1132
00:51:42,860 --> 00:51:47,860
Yeah.
That whole crew of the tribe called 

1133
00:51:47,860 --> 00:51:47,860
quest.
Those guys.

1134
00:51:47,860 --> 00:51:47,990
I mean there's curses,
but not a lot.

1135
00:51:48,010 --> 00:51:49,850
It's not a lot of cursing jungle 
brothers.

1136
00:51:49,910 --> 00:51:52,090
It's just more intelligent,
really.

1137
00:51:52,140 --> 00:51:56,540
Like they're more sophisticated songs,
so has a lot of swears and he's the best

1138
00:51:56,541 --> 00:51:58,120
writer in my opinion.
He's brilliant.

1139
00:51:58,180 --> 00:51:59,060
Yeah,
he's,

1140
00:51:59,090 --> 00:52:02,230
he's my favorite writer.
How dare you.

1141
00:52:02,240 --> 00:52:07,240
Did you say that ether what's going on?
Do you really believe what you're 

1142
00:52:07,240 --> 00:52:08,090
saying?
Honestly,

1143
00:52:08,100 --> 00:52:13,100
I'm not familiar.
I'm not a big Jay z around Eric B and 

1144
00:52:17,421 --> 00:52:18,450
Rakim.
Oh,

1145
00:52:18,470 --> 00:52:19,100
you got it.

1146
00:52:22,100 --> 00:52:24,170
I'm an older kid.
I grew up listening to punk,

1147
00:52:24,480 --> 00:52:25,820
you know,
smashing pumpkins.

1148
00:52:27,150 --> 00:52:32,150
Do you just look at me like I was gonna 
fight on my range.

1149
00:52:37,941 --> 00:52:41,360
I'm still just a rat in a cage.
It's a great fucking song.

1150
00:52:43,050 --> 00:52:48,050
You like.
Tell me like telling you like circle 

1151
00:52:48,050 --> 00:52:48,050
jerks.
You know,

1152
00:52:48,050 --> 00:52:51,300
I grew up in La,
so the sonic youth and x and Paul,

1153
00:52:51,330 --> 00:52:53,930
the pixies are my favorite.
I like modest mouse,

1154
00:52:53,931 --> 00:52:56,600
I'm trapped in the nineties and little 
didn't get along with the parents,

1155
00:52:58,920 --> 00:53:02,590
talked to my shrink.
Haidale yeah,

1156
00:53:02,600 --> 00:53:04,850
a lot of anger.
The greatest similar thing.

1157
00:53:04,851 --> 00:53:08,930
It's anger and whatever the best 
lyricists don't.

1158
00:53:09,350 --> 00:53:09,830
Yeah,
they don't.

1159
00:53:09,831 --> 00:53:14,831
They do have a little cursing.
I think if you make your list like rock 

1160
00:53:14,831 --> 00:53:17,780
him a Jay z big daddy kane,
all those guys have like they have.

1161
00:53:18,350 --> 00:53:19,940
They don't rely on it.
The curse,

1162
00:53:19,941 --> 00:53:22,580
but they're not like fucking suck his 
Dick Right now.

1163
00:53:22,980 --> 00:53:24,200
It's not crazy.
Well,

1164
00:53:24,201 --> 00:53:26,130
when Nwa came out,
I remember

1165
00:53:26,130 --> 00:53:31,130
I was on a treadmill and I was.
Nobody's ever said that in history of 

1166
00:53:32,110 --> 00:53:37,110
ever than ever.
I had a cassette or a might've been a 

1167
00:53:37,141 --> 00:53:38,400
CD.
I'm not sure.

1168
00:53:38,510 --> 00:53:42,000
And I don't fucking know what it was,
is the eighties,

1169
00:53:42,001 --> 00:53:44,340
right?
Because I was living in Boston,

1170
00:53:44,341 --> 00:53:49,341
so it had to be the eighties and uh,
I was at the gym and I was listening to 

1171
00:53:49,341 --> 00:53:49,341
either,
like I said,

1172
00:53:49,341 --> 00:53:54,171
he was either on a treadmill or no,
it was either a walkman cassette or it 

1173
00:53:54,171 --> 00:53:54,760
was a um,
uh,

1174
00:53:54,840 --> 00:53:57,720
a disc player.
I don't know even know if it was a disc.

1175
00:53:58,680 --> 00:54:00,390
I don't remember.
I can't remember,

1176
00:54:00,660 --> 00:54:03,690
but I do remember that I'm on,
I'm on the Treadmill,

1177
00:54:03,691 --> 00:54:06,360
I'm doing my road work and I'm listening
to this shit.

1178
00:54:06,361 --> 00:54:08,850
I'm like,
what the fuck am I listening to?

1179
00:54:08,930 --> 00:54:09,910
Yeah.
You know,

1180
00:54:09,960 --> 00:54:11,700
it was like,
these blacks are intense.

1181
00:54:12,520 --> 00:54:14,340
It was bothering me.
It was.

1182
00:54:14,640 --> 00:54:19,640
Yeah.
It was bothering me because it was so 

1183
00:54:19,640 --> 00:54:21,470
violent and so negative and it was.
They were raping a girl and one of the 

1184
00:54:21,470 --> 00:54:23,080
videos and then they shot her.
She,

1185
00:54:23,090 --> 00:54:25,020
she wouldn't shut the fuck up or 
something.

1186
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:31,000
You know,
you remember.

1187
00:54:35,450 --> 00:54:37,400
I mean that was,
that was one of their songs.

1188
00:54:37,410 --> 00:54:41,070
I was like fucking a girl and she 
wouldn't shut up until they shot her.

1189
00:54:41,670 --> 00:54:42,910
Well,
I grew up in that bitch.

1190
00:54:43,110 --> 00:54:48,110
Shut up bitch drive.
La exploded because that's was here.

1191
00:54:48,481 --> 00:54:51,370
It was here,
man.

1192
00:54:51,510 --> 00:54:56,510
You couldn't wear red or blue to school 
because of the crips and the bloods 

1193
00:54:56,510 --> 00:54:56,810
because of that album?
Yes.

1194
00:54:56,850 --> 00:54:59,160
Do you think that that music caused 
violence?

1195
00:54:59,490 --> 00:55:01,080
No.
Well why not?

1196
00:55:01,140 --> 00:55:05,110
You just said what did you just say?
But that's the educators a perception.

1197
00:55:05,111 --> 00:55:10,111
You don't,
you think it inspired people to be more 

1198
00:55:10,111 --> 00:55:12,291
gang activity that inspired the Rachel 
Dolezal is of those that

1199
00:55:14,970 --> 00:55:17,440
I think that those albums really were.
They were,

1200
00:55:17,460 --> 00:55:22,460
they were report card.
They were like journalistic pieces of 

1201
00:55:22,460 --> 00:55:25,371
what was really going on in like that 
black neighborhood existed already in 

1202
00:55:25,371 --> 00:55:30,220
the schools and that kind of imitators 
and posers that probably,

1203
00:55:30,781 --> 00:55:35,781
you know,
like I know a kid that got all gang 

1204
00:55:35,781 --> 00:55:35,781
tattoos that.
Yeah.

1205
00:55:35,781 --> 00:55:36,270
Yeah.
All tagged,

1206
00:55:36,271 --> 00:55:41,271
like legit gay and he's never been in a 
gang and he was so dumb and it's like 

1207
00:55:41,271 --> 00:55:46,101
that's gonna get you that you're kind of
being tattoos like a south,

1208
00:55:46,260 --> 00:55:48,690
like soda annual,
like a Mexican gangs.

1209
00:55:48,810 --> 00:55:52,480
What nationality was he Jewish was.
Well he was half Mexican.

1210
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:54,600
Oh,
he was happy he was half Mexican.

1211
00:55:54,630 --> 00:55:55,780
But.
Well that's more Mexican.

1212
00:55:55,820 --> 00:56:00,820
INVINCEA yeah,
zero.

1213
00:56:02,170 --> 00:56:03,990
Well he's um,
whatever,

1214
00:56:04,270 --> 00:56:06,870
something.
So this guy had half Mexican.

1215
00:56:06,930 --> 00:56:09,000
He's half Mexican,
half Irish.

1216
00:56:09,030 --> 00:56:10,130
But you know,
he,

1217
00:56:10,370 --> 00:56:12,360
he looked,
he looked,

1218
00:56:12,840 --> 00:56:15,030
he didn't look like a,
he didn't look full blooded.

1219
00:56:15,030 --> 00:56:17,190
But you could be you,
but you would see the Latin in them.

1220
00:56:17,370 --> 00:56:20,510
But it was more about the tattoos and 
two,

1221
00:56:20,540 --> 00:56:25,540
he had the craziest thing happened.
So this kids tatted up with like wannabe

1222
00:56:27,010 --> 00:56:28,150
gang tattoos,
right.

1223
00:56:28,240 --> 00:56:31,480
Like you wouldn't know unless you knew 
him that he's not in a gang.

1224
00:56:31,990 --> 00:56:35,760
He gets a dui and he gets thrown into 
the,

1225
00:56:36,400 --> 00:56:41,400
to the towers downtown,
which was hell on earth if you don't 

1226
00:56:41,400 --> 00:56:43,810
know the jails in La.
And he's caught wind towers.

1227
00:56:43,820 --> 00:56:44,830
Yeah.
Yeah.

1228
00:56:44,831 --> 00:56:48,370
And they're really the,
that's like the one of the worst jails,

1229
00:56:48,371 --> 00:56:50,800
the to be locked up and in America for a
jail.

1230
00:56:51,670 --> 00:56:55,810
So he gets thrown in there,
supposed to be like a 12 hour hold.

1231
00:56:56,440 --> 00:56:57,850
Well,
he gets thrown into the pit,

1232
00:56:57,910 --> 00:56:59,140
right?
And it's like,

1233
00:56:59,170 --> 00:57:00,610
it's what it used to be the,
uh,

1234
00:57:00,611 --> 00:57:05,611
the gym and now it's just bunk bunk beds
because they have overrun as he's there 

1235
00:57:06,100 --> 00:57:07,900
in the first 12 hours.

1236
00:57:08,500 --> 00:57:12,010
They throw him into like a Mexican pit.
And then you have to.

1237
00:57:12,011 --> 00:57:13,570
There's like a north side and south 
siders.

1238
00:57:14,320 --> 00:57:17,800
He gets thrown,
he goes and he goes into his bunk and he

1239
00:57:17,801 --> 00:57:20,110
goes like few hours.
Then he's just counting down the hours,

1240
00:57:20,111 --> 00:57:21,760
like no one's fucked with me yet,
nothing.

1241
00:57:22,930 --> 00:57:27,930
One of the prisoners goes up to a female
guard and punches her in the face and 

1242
00:57:29,980 --> 00:57:34,980
they a riot breaks out.
So He's there for drunk driving and he's

1243
00:57:35,501 --> 00:57:37,270
in the middle of,
of the Malay,

1244
00:57:37,300 --> 00:57:41,140
like chairs and beds being thrown.
So they locked down the jail,

1245
00:57:41,260 --> 00:57:46,260
like total lockdown.
People are being thrown in the hole and 

1246
00:57:46,260 --> 00:57:47,320
all this shit.
He's just like,

1247
00:57:47,350 --> 00:57:49,690
oh shit.
I got like four hours ago now.

1248
00:57:50,350 --> 00:57:51,910
And he's like,
he's like,

1249
00:57:51,911 --> 00:57:53,410
you call over a guard,
like,

1250
00:57:53,590 --> 00:57:54,400
oh,
excuse me,

1251
00:57:54,970 --> 00:57:56,530
guard and the guard.
You're like,

1252
00:57:56,531 --> 00:57:58,560
fuck you.
Like just calling,

1253
00:57:58,600 --> 00:58:01,420
like calling everybody by racial slurs.

1254
00:58:01,420 --> 00:58:06,420
He said like,
all the guards are like Peckerwood or 

1255
00:58:06,420 --> 00:58:06,420
the white guys.
Yeah,

1256
00:58:06,420 --> 00:58:06,550
shut up fucking beaner,
like,

1257
00:58:06,620 --> 00:58:11,400
like all kinds of stuff.
So he's like,

1258
00:58:11,410 --> 00:58:13,240
now I've been there a day,
dude.

1259
00:58:13,450 --> 00:58:17,620
They keep them there 12 days for any 
supposed to be.

1260
00:58:17,621 --> 00:58:22,621
And he goes,
I just can't get anybody to listen to 

1261
00:58:22,621 --> 00:58:22,621
me.
Like,

1262
00:58:22,621 --> 00:58:22,790
to,
to take,

1263
00:58:23,010 --> 00:58:23,790
to,
to,

1264
00:58:24,170 --> 00:58:25,570
to talk to and be like,
Hey,

1265
00:58:25,571 --> 00:58:27,310
I'm supposed to be released.
They're like,

1266
00:58:27,311 --> 00:58:28,260
yeah,
everyone's supposed to be released.

1267
00:58:28,290 --> 00:58:30,760
Fuck you.
Like nobody pays attention to him.

1268
00:58:31,270 --> 00:58:34,870
He then gets transferred to a jail in 
the valley,

1269
00:58:34,930 --> 00:58:38,190
all drunk driving drunk driving.
So in the,

1270
00:58:38,300 --> 00:58:42,130
in the jail that's out in the valley.
They call it the Hyatt within the,

1271
00:58:42,220 --> 00:58:46,000
the La because it's so much better than 
the towers downtown.

1272
00:58:46,840 --> 00:58:51,840
And he goes out there and he stays there
two days and then they release them and 

1273
00:58:53,110 --> 00:58:53,500
I go,
well,

1274
00:58:53,501 --> 00:58:54,880
what,
what happened when you said like,

1275
00:58:54,881 --> 00:58:57,970
I was supposed to be released 14 days 
ago.

1276
00:58:58,600 --> 00:58:59,380
They're like,
yeah,

1277
00:59:00,120 --> 00:59:01,930
we got it,
got lost in the system.

1278
00:59:02,850 --> 00:59:05,840
Like,
and he told me he didn't shit the entire

1279
00:59:05,860 --> 00:59:08,380
time for 14 days.
That doesn't make any sense.

1280
00:59:09,840 --> 00:59:12,580
Sorry,
someone's told me this before because if

1281
00:59:12,581 --> 00:59:15,220
you're in a cell,
a holding cell and there are more people

1282
00:59:15,221 --> 00:59:18,190
in there and oh my God,
toilet in the center of the room.

1283
00:59:18,191 --> 00:59:23,191
So he said,
I asked him how it was possible and he 

1284
00:59:23,191 --> 00:59:23,780
said,
know he barely ate.

1285
00:59:23,900 --> 00:59:25,680
But he said that like,
you know,

1286
00:59:25,790 --> 00:59:28,880
day three and day four he would go to 
the,

1287
00:59:28,881 --> 00:59:33,881
can drop his pants.
And then because there's ways you're 

1288
00:59:33,881 --> 00:59:37,871
supposed to walk and places that like 
two black eyes or two white guys would 

1289
00:59:38,241 --> 00:59:40,880
walk to the sink that you can see from 
the shitter.

1290
00:59:41,360 --> 00:59:46,360
And as soon as he saw them,
he would just pull up his pants because 

1291
00:59:46,360 --> 00:59:49,511
he thought he would get attacked and he 
said he didn't even have a desire to go 

1292
00:59:49,511 --> 00:59:49,511
like days.

1293
00:59:49,511 --> 00:59:52,370
So they would look at him like,
because he was taking his pants off,

1294
00:59:52,371 --> 00:59:53,960
he wouldn't even look at him.
He would,

1295
00:59:53,961 --> 00:59:57,470
he,
he said that he would see them just walk

1296
00:59:57,471 --> 01:00:01,370
into the area that he was going to shit 
in and all his,

1297
01:00:01,730 --> 01:00:03,590
his uh,
you know,

1298
01:00:03,800 --> 01:00:05,870
instincts were like,
this is,

1299
01:00:05,990 --> 01:00:07,910
you're about to get attacked even if 
the.

1300
01:00:08,210 --> 01:00:10,670
So he just pulled his pants up and he 
couldn't even shed.

1301
01:00:10,820 --> 01:00:13,040
So no one called him on his fake gang 
tattoos.

1302
01:00:13,070 --> 01:00:14,720
Nobody called him on his fake gang 
tattoos.

1303
01:00:14,721 --> 01:00:15,890
Wow.
That's super lucky.

1304
01:00:15,910 --> 01:00:20,910
Yeah,
they were really good gang tattoos I 

1305
01:00:20,910 --> 01:00:21,320
guess.
Really what a fucking idiot.

1306
01:00:21,321 --> 01:00:23,120
Yeah.
He's so dumb because he still have those

1307
01:00:23,121 --> 01:00:25,130
tattoos.
I haven't seen him now in a while.

1308
01:00:25,160 --> 01:00:27,170
How do you know this guy?
I used to work,

1309
01:00:27,260 --> 01:00:30,500
uh,
basically with him and for him,

1310
01:00:31,250 --> 01:00:32,270
for him.
Well,

1311
01:00:32,271 --> 01:00:33,880
his family worked for his family.

1312
01:00:34,310 --> 01:00:36,560
What is family think about is retarded 
tattoos.

1313
01:00:36,710 --> 01:00:41,710
They didn't understand.
They thought that he would tell them 

1314
01:00:41,710 --> 01:00:41,710
that they were other things because 
they're,

1315
01:00:41,710 --> 01:00:42,320
they're really like,
you know,

1316
01:00:42,690 --> 01:00:45,880
they're really well done,
but there were so crazy like the,

1317
01:00:45,881 --> 01:00:46,970
the,
the,

1318
01:00:46,971 --> 01:00:47,780
they'd be like,
what is that?

1319
01:00:47,781 --> 01:00:48,390
He'd be like,
ah,

1320
01:00:48,391 --> 01:00:51,870
it's just the Lakers.
And then they wouldn't.

1321
01:00:52,030 --> 01:00:53,350
They're like,
I didn't know.

1322
01:00:53,810 --> 01:00:56,090
What does this family do?
What was the business?

1323
01:00:56,130 --> 01:01:01,130
Um,
it was like entertainment stuff out 

1324
01:01:01,130 --> 01:01:01,130
here,
but like they were,

1325
01:01:01,130 --> 01:01:02,420
they were really well to do.
It was a funny thing.

1326
01:01:02,450 --> 01:01:03,350
Oh,
that's hilarious.

1327
01:01:03,410 --> 01:01:05,990
Did you see that?
The story of the guy get him out of jail

1328
01:01:06,410 --> 01:01:08,180
dude,
because they had a very,

1329
01:01:08,181 --> 01:01:12,290
uh,
a conflicted relationship,

1330
01:01:12,380 --> 01:01:15,650
you know,
so they just let them rotten there.

1331
01:01:15,730 --> 01:01:20,730
I don't think they knew he was in there 
almost like those kind of thing where 

1332
01:01:20,730 --> 01:01:20,730
they don't talk like,
you know,

1333
01:01:20,730 --> 01:01:20,730
all the time.

1334
01:01:20,730 --> 01:01:21,710
Wow.
I don't think.

1335
01:01:21,800 --> 01:01:24,950
And even afterwards he told his daddy 
was on vacation.

1336
01:01:25,640 --> 01:01:28,370
You think you'd find somebody to take 
that phone call though?

1337
01:01:28,371 --> 01:01:33,371
Right?
Kudos to him for keeping his fucking 

1338
01:01:33,371 --> 01:01:36,731
mouth shut because I would think that 
would be like the time that you will 

1339
01:01:36,731 --> 01:01:37,660
really need your help.
I cried.

1340
01:01:37,700 --> 01:01:42,700
Did you see the guy in the news that he 
got arrested for a murder because he had

1341
01:01:44,481 --> 01:01:48,380
the murder scene tattooed on his chest.
Isn't about saying?

1342
01:01:48,410 --> 01:01:53,410
Yeah.
Do you know about this guy murdered 

1343
01:01:53,410 --> 01:01:56,630
somebody years ago and over time has 
been adding to a chest piece.

1344
01:01:56,810 --> 01:02:01,810
All of the details of the murder and 
just so happened that a homicide 

1345
01:02:01,810 --> 01:02:06,701
detective was looking through pictures 
of of suspects for something unrelated.

1346
01:02:08,600 --> 01:02:12,380
Saw this guy,
saw the tattoo and worked that case.

1347
01:02:12,381 --> 01:02:15,590
It was like,
that's the store that's the helicopter.

1348
01:02:16,880 --> 01:02:19,980
Put it together was like this guy knows,
has the details of a

1349
01:02:19,980 --> 01:02:23,620
murder on.
Oh my God.

1350
01:02:23,670 --> 01:02:26,800
See the helicopter there and the liquor 
store to get the job.

1351
01:02:26,830 --> 01:02:31,830
Someone did a good job and the era kills
and he has and then the guy was like,

1352
01:02:32,630 --> 01:02:34,800
this is me Rivera.
As I say me,

1353
01:02:35,010 --> 01:02:38,910
I think so me Rivera and then it was 
like,

1354
01:02:38,911 --> 01:02:43,480
look,
this is me homes and the liquor store,

1355
01:02:43,670 --> 01:02:45,750
the only photos.
See if there's a better photo.

1356
01:02:45,751 --> 01:02:50,751
It shows the whole thing.
We'll look at the helicopter is like a 

1357
01:02:50,751 --> 01:02:51,780
shark and angry shark.
What a dummy.

1358
01:02:51,930 --> 01:02:55,170
So like that was probably like his big 
claim to fame that he killed somebody.

1359
01:02:55,890 --> 01:02:59,340
So I decided,
uh Oh look,

1360
01:02:59,341 --> 01:03:02,820
it's got him with the gun sideways,
which is always hilarious.

1361
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:05,310
Right?
And then there's the real gangster gang.

1362
01:03:05,840 --> 01:03:07,260
Peanut,
you see that peanut there?

1363
01:03:08,220 --> 01:03:13,220
So the peanut,
the peanut getting shot is what they 

1364
01:03:13,220 --> 01:03:14,150
call the uh,
the,

1365
01:03:14,270 --> 01:03:17,100
that's like the pejorative term for 
their rival gang.

1366
01:03:17,370 --> 01:03:18,590
Peanuts,
peanuts.

1367
01:03:18,610 --> 01:03:21,540
So it's like Mr Pineda agencies holding 
Mr Peanut.

1368
01:03:22,610 --> 01:03:25,290
Is he shooting Mr Peanut?
That's not a very clear picture.

1369
01:03:26,120 --> 01:03:27,930
A shot.
It's weird.

1370
01:03:27,931 --> 01:03:32,430
I just got all these pictures of him.
This is me on me.

1371
01:03:32,990 --> 01:03:37,990
Look,
he's got a fucking Bandana on his face 

1372
01:03:37,990 --> 01:03:39,480
while he's shooting all the peanut 
getting shot by the helicopter.

1373
01:03:39,481 --> 01:03:44,040
That's like a shark or a dog or what is 
that helicopter?

1374
01:03:44,041 --> 01:03:46,020
What is that?
It looks like a shark or something.

1375
01:03:46,530 --> 01:03:47,610
Yeah,
or something.

1376
01:03:47,611 --> 01:03:49,650
I love that he put the entire who's 
like,

1377
01:03:49,651 --> 01:03:50,600
yeah,
uh,

1378
01:03:51,150 --> 01:03:54,780
put the address on his 18,
31 or two were killed.

1379
01:03:54,781 --> 01:03:59,781
This guy,
he'll get the peanuts running is a 

1380
01:03:59,781 --> 01:04:00,150
picture of the peanut running.
There's brains coming out of it.

1381
01:04:02,220 --> 01:04:07,220
It's so weird.
What is shitty piece of fucking art and 

1382
01:04:07,220 --> 01:04:10,940
I love the sideways gun thing.
I just don't want to aim the good way to

1383
01:04:11,161 --> 01:04:12,870
do it.
I'm not good at doing this.

1384
01:04:12,900 --> 01:04:16,940
Motherfucker get closest to you.
What's there?

1385
01:04:17,160 --> 01:04:18,960
That's him.
That's the same guy.

1386
01:04:19,410 --> 01:04:21,150
What is this?
Oh,

1387
01:04:21,151 --> 01:04:24,480
Jesus Christ.
What is all that?

1388
01:04:24,510 --> 01:04:29,510
That's my back.
Someone killing somebody with a hammer 

1389
01:04:29,510 --> 01:04:33,210
is terrible.
People of this world.

1390
01:04:33,450 --> 01:04:37,420
My son never gets that.
You failed,

1391
01:04:37,421 --> 01:04:40,290
right?
As a parent or something went wrong,

1392
01:04:40,730 --> 01:04:42,600
send them to the wrong school district.
By the way,

1393
01:04:42,601 --> 01:04:46,200
speaking a great.
A great lyricists who curse a lot.

1394
01:04:46,230 --> 01:04:51,230
Mc Ren from Nwa.
That guy can write a dirty song and 

1395
01:04:51,301 --> 01:04:54,960
really like he's afraid.
That neat song you played on our show,

1396
01:04:55,180 --> 01:05:00,150
that neat song was about a young lady 
and she,

1397
01:05:00,620 --> 01:05:02,580
he performed fellatio.
Blowjob.

1398
01:05:02,600 --> 01:05:05,070
Betty,
everybody knows that too.

1399
01:05:05,071 --> 01:05:06,200
Short,
too short,

1400
01:05:06,310 --> 01:05:06,500
too.

1401
01:05:06,500 --> 01:05:08,590
Two shorts just littered with them.
Yeah.

1402
01:05:08,670 --> 01:05:13,670
Well that song,
he accidentally kills a girl with his 

1403
01:05:13,670 --> 01:05:14,220
nuts.
Really Sad.

1404
01:05:15,270 --> 01:05:16,650
You could tell he feels really bad about
it.

1405
01:05:17,410 --> 01:05:22,410
Oh my God.
He killed her with a gun and killed the 

1406
01:05:22,410 --> 01:05:23,830
bitch.
You really smart.

1407
01:05:23,890 --> 01:05:27,650
I also enjoy two live crew's work.
Yeah.

1408
01:05:28,070 --> 01:05:30,250
Yeah.
Pop that pussy.

1409
01:05:32,080 --> 01:05:32,650
Well,
those are.

1410
01:05:32,651 --> 01:05:33,840
Those guys are.
Oh Geez.

1411
01:05:33,850 --> 01:05:36,760
Because they went to jail for that shit.
Remember Broward County?

1412
01:05:36,880 --> 01:05:38,020
Broward County,
Florida.

1413
01:05:38,520 --> 01:05:41,770
That was a big issue across America.
Florida is the spot,

1414
01:05:41,771 --> 01:05:44,620
like if they ever want to bust you and 
bring you to jail,

1415
01:05:44,621 --> 01:05:49,621
they try you in Florida for obscenity.
That's what happened to that Max 

1416
01:05:49,621 --> 01:05:51,550
hardcore guy.
That guy that was doing lauren crazy.

1417
01:05:52,030 --> 01:05:55,870
Awful porn like I'm not.
I'm not a censorship.

1418
01:05:56,320 --> 01:06:01,320
I'm not pro censorship in any way,
shape or form and I think you should be 

1419
01:06:01,320 --> 01:06:01,320
able to do whatever the fuck you want to
do,

1420
01:06:01,320 --> 01:06:02,500
but there's very few people where you 
go,

1421
01:06:02,560 --> 01:06:05,120
oh,
maybe there shouldn't be doing.

1422
01:06:05,130 --> 01:06:09,700
I don't know.
Open girl's ass holes up with a speculum

1423
01:06:11,980 --> 01:06:15,550
in that made them drink his piss out of 
their own ass.

1424
01:06:15,570 --> 01:06:16,150
Like that.

1425
01:06:20,760 --> 01:06:25,600
So bizarre,
funniest part.

1426
01:06:29,950 --> 01:06:30,100
You

1427
01:06:30,100 --> 01:06:33,200
know what turns me on like big tits.
Here's what I want you to do.

1428
01:06:33,410 --> 01:06:36,830
I'm going to Piss in your ass and put a 
straw in it and then you drink.

1429
01:06:36,831 --> 01:06:40,880
It has to be a very small niche 
audience.

1430
01:06:41,450 --> 01:06:43,700
Wow.
This is really my lane.

1431
01:06:43,820 --> 01:06:46,790
That thing probably got popular because 
people probably.

1432
01:06:46,791 --> 01:06:48,830
It's not that there was their lane.
They were like,

1433
01:06:48,860 --> 01:06:53,010
how far can this guy pushed out?
What a crazy freak.

1434
01:06:53,011 --> 01:06:56,600
He was probably just jerked off to 
everything else that exists.

1435
01:06:57,270 --> 01:07:00,770
Tap out people hit a point where they're
like,

1436
01:07:00,980 --> 01:07:03,710
I need.
I need something more fucked up.

1437
01:07:03,711 --> 01:07:07,400
It's like the porn of today.
Okay.

1438
01:07:07,401 --> 01:07:11,570
Like think about the Horn of today in 
comparison to the porn of Ron,

1439
01:07:11,690 --> 01:07:13,650
Jeremy,
Peter North,

1440
01:07:13,700 --> 01:07:17,120
Ginger Lynn.
Thrill with sex is just sex.

1441
01:07:18,070 --> 01:07:23,070
And then somewhere along the line and 
got to gagging and like,

1442
01:07:23,710 --> 01:07:28,710
you know,
I wrote a piece on my blog a long time 

1443
01:07:28,710 --> 01:07:32,351
ago about a porn party that we went to 
and we had a friend that we were doing 

1444
01:07:32,351 --> 01:07:32,630
Jujitsu with.

1445
01:07:32,630 --> 01:07:37,630
It was directing porn.
So we went to this porn party and we 

1446
01:07:37,630 --> 01:07:37,940
figured,
well this part is going to be crazy.

1447
01:07:37,941 --> 01:07:39,620
It's going to be,
this is going to be wild.

1448
01:07:39,860 --> 01:07:43,100
But when we got there,
what it was was a screening.

1449
01:07:43,101 --> 01:07:47,150
It was so strange.
It's like they were in a parking lot and

1450
01:07:47,151 --> 01:07:51,910
they had a projection screen up on the 
wall with strangers.

1451
01:07:52,110 --> 01:07:54,020
Oh,
so excited about this.

1452
01:07:54,021 --> 01:07:59,000
I think I remembered this story.
This porn that he was showing was filmed

1453
01:07:59,001 --> 01:08:00,830
war.
It was art porn.

1454
01:08:01,160 --> 01:08:04,520
And the guy who directed it,
who's still a friend of mine,

1455
01:08:04,910 --> 01:08:09,910
uh,
had decided that he was going to do 

1456
01:08:09,910 --> 01:08:09,910
something that had never been done 
before.

1457
01:08:09,980 --> 01:08:12,830
Do like a real,
like murder mystery,

1458
01:08:13,010 --> 01:08:14,990
but have the people fucking this murder 
mystery.

1459
01:08:15,200 --> 01:08:17,570
So they just happened to have porn 
scenes.

1460
01:08:17,960 --> 01:08:21,050
And so we were there.
And in this scene,

1461
01:08:21,080 --> 01:08:23,660
this scene is just,
this girl is,

1462
01:08:23,661 --> 01:08:28,661
this guy's going to ask to mouth on this
girl and then like,

1463
01:08:33,000 --> 01:08:35,440
I mean like otter,
w,

1464
01:08:35,441 --> 01:08:35,910
w,
w,

1465
01:08:35,911 --> 01:08:40,911
the way I described it was chalkboard 
eraser slapping and then like the sound 

1466
01:08:40,911 --> 01:08:43,620
of an auto smack,
smack,

1467
01:08:43,760 --> 01:08:44,550
smack,
smack.

1468
01:08:45,800 --> 01:08:49,160
Wonderful.
And while this is going on,

1469
01:08:49,880 --> 01:08:54,880
someone goes,
she's here or she's here and so the car 

1470
01:08:54,880 --> 01:08:57,760
pulls up and she gets out and they treat
it like a star as arrived.

1471
01:08:57,800 --> 01:08:58,400
Right?
And she's,

1472
01:08:58,490 --> 01:09:01,340
and she's with this guy and the guy gets
out,

1473
01:09:01,610 --> 01:09:03,440
the guy that she's with who's just a 
young kid,

1474
01:09:03,620 --> 01:09:06,050
gets out and looks at the screen and 
looks at her.

1475
01:09:06,290 --> 01:09:08,330
I think the article is still up 
somewhere,

1476
01:09:08,331 --> 01:09:11,420
see if he could find that.
Looks at her,

1477
01:09:11,480 --> 01:09:13,670
looks at the screen and,
and like.

1478
01:09:13,770 --> 01:09:15,710
And she goes,
I was going to tell you.

1479
01:09:16,790 --> 01:09:20,660
And so she has a strong performer.
So very fun.

1480
01:09:20,980 --> 01:09:22,550
The guys blinking.
And he's like,

1481
01:09:22,720 --> 01:09:24,860
what the fuck?
And so we,

1482
01:09:25,100 --> 01:09:28,700
we see the guy,
we immediately run over to him and I go,

1483
01:09:28,970 --> 01:09:31,940
did you not know that she was in this 
film?

1484
01:09:32,150 --> 01:09:33,950
He goes,
I had no fucking idea,

1485
01:09:34,250 --> 01:09:39,250
and I go,
what did you think she does does for 

1486
01:09:39,250 --> 01:09:39,250
living here?

1487
01:09:39,250 --> 01:09:41,600
She told me she was a makeup artist,
so she told him that she was a makeup 

1488
01:09:41,600 --> 01:09:43,610
artist and then took him to a screening.
Yeah.

1489
01:09:43,730 --> 01:09:45,100
This is it.
This is the.

1490
01:09:45,101 --> 01:09:47,770
The is the photos.
Are the photos still on there?

1491
01:09:48,880 --> 01:09:50,390
They're not there.
That's insane.

1492
01:09:50,391 --> 01:09:53,270
My website sucks.
Others pictures,

1493
01:09:53,271 --> 01:09:58,070
but where the fuck are they?
That's a hard way to find out.

1494
01:09:58,071 --> 01:10:03,071
That's a tough one.
It's not the way you want to see that 

1495
01:10:03,071 --> 01:10:03,071
new.
That documentary.

1496
01:10:03,071 --> 01:10:03,430
Hot Girls wanted.
No,

1497
01:10:03,470 --> 01:10:03,950
actually.
Yeah.

1498
01:10:04,080 --> 01:10:05,700
Is it good for Netflix?
Right?

1499
01:10:05,710 --> 01:10:07,310
It's good.
It's good,

1500
01:10:07,730 --> 01:10:10,250
but it's not like.
It's not as hot as it is.

1501
01:10:10,251 --> 01:10:12,610
Just all those girls wanted.
Yeah,

1502
01:10:12,640 --> 01:10:14,060
know what I'm saying?
It's nothing.

1503
01:10:14,270 --> 01:10:19,270
It's exactly what you like.
You could probably watch the trailer in 

1504
01:10:19,270 --> 01:10:20,480
the movie is not going to porn.
It was a bummer.

1505
01:10:20,600 --> 01:10:23,720
That should be the it.
What it does is it tells you young girls

1506
01:10:23,721 --> 01:10:28,721
are exploited by porn and it's a 
documentary about so you don't watch it 

1507
01:10:28,721 --> 01:10:29,130
go.
I didn't know that.

1508
01:10:29,140 --> 01:10:33,940
You're just seeing it like I didn't know
earl to have fun.

1509
01:10:34,100 --> 01:10:37,070
It was all a good time and then no,
like the girl's like,

1510
01:10:37,071 --> 01:10:37,610
yeah,
you know,

1511
01:10:37,611 --> 01:10:41,330
and then they made me vomit and then 
yeah,

1512
01:10:41,331 --> 01:10:43,360
this girl is talking about like one of 
her first scenes,

1513
01:10:43,390 --> 01:10:44,330
like,
Oh God,

1514
01:10:44,360 --> 01:10:47,390
force choking,
a facial abuse or something.

1515
01:10:47,630 --> 01:10:52,630
Patient abuse is a whole category.
And the guy behind the camera and he's 

1516
01:10:53,060 --> 01:10:53,840
like,
look at you.

1517
01:10:53,930 --> 01:10:56,540
We were watching the Youtube version of 
that.

1518
01:10:56,541 --> 01:10:59,110
Remember the guy who was like your beat,
you know that.

1519
01:11:02,350 --> 01:11:03,990
He goes,
you know that in the.

1520
01:11:04,320 --> 01:11:05,960
Yeah.
What does that mean?

1521
01:11:05,961 --> 01:11:08,280
You'd be like,
you're just throwing your broken.

1522
01:11:08,620 --> 01:11:10,070
Busted your ugliest.
He's like,

1523
01:11:10,071 --> 01:11:10,730
you,
Jesus.

1524
01:11:10,731 --> 01:11:13,980
Where the fuck did you crawl out of?
Like he rips them

1525
01:11:13,980 --> 01:11:15,600
apart,
like the way they look.

1526
01:11:16,800 --> 01:11:18,090
Yeah.
Oh God.

1527
01:11:19,010 --> 01:11:20,000
He's like,
did you smoke?

1528
01:11:20,560 --> 01:11:23,010
Do like ask the Barbara for the 
Cornelius.

1529
01:11:23,400 --> 01:11:24,710
And she's like,
let's see,

1530
01:11:24,740 --> 01:11:27,200
like you don't know what that is.
Go Watch planet of the apes Jesus.

1531
01:11:27,210 --> 01:11:27,910
I'm like,
uh,

1532
01:11:28,050 --> 01:11:28,680
yeah.
Yeah,

1533
01:11:28,770 --> 01:11:30,060
he's A.
Yeah,

1534
01:11:30,061 --> 01:11:35,061
see,
that's a style of porn with the abusive 

1535
01:11:35,061 --> 01:11:35,720
shitty.
Do people I like,

1536
01:11:35,730 --> 01:11:36,960
I,
like you were saying,

1537
01:11:36,961 --> 01:11:39,390
I grew up on a kinder,
gentler era.

1538
01:11:39,600 --> 01:11:40,980
Like I literally,
I grew up,

1539
01:11:40,981 --> 01:11:45,981
you know,
the wackiest thing you would see on a 

1540
01:11:45,981 --> 01:11:47,811
vhs porno,
it was like they are doing it on a 

1541
01:11:47,811 --> 01:11:50,280
forklift.
It was crazy there to work on a car and 

1542
01:11:50,280 --> 01:11:50,280
they get horny.
Yep.

1543
01:11:50,300 --> 01:11:51,480
And that was,
that was enough.

1544
01:11:51,510 --> 01:11:55,770
That felt like enough.
Take those fucking those overalls off.

1545
01:11:55,830 --> 01:11:59,330
You're going to fuck on this tractor 
bomb now.

1546
01:11:59,350 --> 01:12:01,590
It's like step on our next.
If you could make her shit,

1547
01:12:01,740 --> 01:12:05,160
smacking them in the face and shit and 
making him throw up.

1548
01:12:05,460 --> 01:12:07,680
I saw one with this guy was mouth 
fucking this girl.

1549
01:12:07,681 --> 01:12:11,720
She barked and then he stuck his dick 
right back in her mouth after she barfed

1550
01:12:11,721 --> 01:12:12,110
on us.
Like,

1551
01:12:12,150 --> 01:12:13,230
Hey,
easy.

1552
01:12:13,231 --> 01:12:14,910
What about stomach acids?
Dude?

1553
01:12:15,420 --> 01:12:17,730
What about the tip of your Dick?
What about bile?

1554
01:12:17,760 --> 01:12:22,760
There's that site,
that site that I go to sometimes for 

1555
01:12:22,760 --> 01:12:22,760
that,
like,

1556
01:12:22,760 --> 01:12:23,160
can I handle this?
The effect,

1557
01:12:23,470 --> 01:12:28,470
you know,
you look at it and you're like 

1558
01:12:28,470 --> 01:12:29,370
unnecessary.
Sometimes people send in their stuff all

1559
01:12:29,371 --> 01:12:32,450
the time sometimes like that's crazy.
And it sense,

1560
01:12:32,451 --> 01:12:33,070
I was like,
Whoa,

1561
01:12:33,071 --> 01:12:33,900
Whoa,
Whoa,

1562
01:12:33,901 --> 01:12:35,810
I can't handle it.
That's next month.

1563
01:12:35,820 --> 01:12:39,960
Butthole.
Pucker a fart stuff.

1564
01:12:39,961 --> 01:12:43,330
Like some guys said,
girl.

1565
01:12:43,890 --> 01:12:48,890
Yeah,
it was a guy and his nose was west 

1566
01:12:48,890 --> 01:12:51,140
firmly in this girl's butt crack.
And then she's Saran wrapped his hair 

1567
01:12:51,140 --> 01:12:56,020
and then she did errands and she walked 
around the kitchen and she like turned 

1568
01:12:56,020 --> 01:12:56,830
the sink on and,
and just party.

1569
01:12:56,920 --> 01:12:58,730
He's like,
she's like,

1570
01:12:58,740 --> 01:13:00,210
yeah,
you like those dirty parts,

1571
01:13:00,211 --> 01:13:03,030
huh?
That's the thing with Saran wrap,

1572
01:13:04,340 --> 01:13:09,340
sack lunch sack lunch.
There's this guy that has Saran wrap 

1573
01:13:09,340 --> 01:13:11,881
diaper on and he just the camera and 
just pans to him and he spreads his 

1574
01:13:11,881 --> 01:13:13,250
cheeks and fills it with diarrhea.

1575
01:13:15,850 --> 01:13:20,850
But it's just fine.
I just,

1576
01:13:22,120 --> 01:13:27,120
it's the sound.
It's a timing fills up fast just to the 

1577
01:13:29,251 --> 01:13:31,150
right.
And then it turns ever so slightly.

1578
01:13:31,200 --> 01:13:36,200
And the spread and the sound.
This is something about someone 

1579
01:13:36,200 --> 01:13:38,000
relishing a woman's farts like holding 
onto that cheeks with.

1580
01:13:38,420 --> 01:13:43,420
Oh yeah.
We talked about it for awhile and then 

1581
01:13:43,420 --> 01:13:45,720
it'd be people wrote in,
people wrote in that were into it,

1582
01:13:45,820 --> 01:13:46,710
you know,
because we were like.

1583
01:13:47,390 --> 01:13:49,050
And then they would tell us,
they were like,

1584
01:13:49,051 --> 01:13:54,051
yeah,
it goes back to like a pretty girl 

1585
01:13:54,051 --> 01:13:54,051
making something dirty,
you know.

1586
01:13:54,051 --> 01:13:55,450
So it's like,
oh my God,

1587
01:13:55,451 --> 01:13:58,590
I'm so embarrassed of what I did.
So they,

1588
01:13:58,591 --> 01:14:00,910
this guy he wrote in that he was like 
my,

1589
01:14:00,930 --> 01:14:05,930
uh,
now he's grown his fiance like nose and 

1590
01:14:05,930 --> 01:14:06,150
it's cool.
And like whenever she has to Fart,

1591
01:14:06,151 --> 01:14:08,190
she calls him over and he gets so 
excited.

1592
01:14:09,930 --> 01:14:12,820
He loves it.
He loves come on.

1593
01:14:12,821 --> 01:14:15,550
How strange or people people are so 
strange,

1594
01:14:15,640 --> 01:14:18,580
the variabilities of what people are 
attracted to.

1595
01:14:19,060 --> 01:14:20,610
It just,
it's so bizarre.

1596
01:14:21,380 --> 01:14:21,670
Yeah.
Well,

1597
01:14:21,671 --> 01:14:24,370
you see like people that are into people
that are so obese,

1598
01:14:24,371 --> 01:14:29,371
they can't get off the couch.
There's guys that turned on by that 

1599
01:14:29,371 --> 01:14:32,680
feeders feeding can feed them or watch 
them.

1600
01:14:32,681 --> 01:14:36,970
And then there's girls who they have,
that's a whole business for them is they

1601
01:14:36,971 --> 01:14:38,890
set up a camera and they're like,
oh,

1602
01:14:38,891 --> 01:14:41,780
I ate cheese and cookies today.
I got to get in.

1603
01:14:42,400 --> 01:14:44,830
And then you just,
you get to watch them.

1604
01:14:45,020 --> 01:14:47,050
You know,
gaining weight shouldn't have done that.

1605
01:14:47,100 --> 01:14:52,100
Their whole thing time that it's a great
way to fucking comedy tends to use my 

1606
01:14:52,841 --> 01:14:54,750
brain to make a living.
You should have jokes.

1607
01:14:54,760 --> 01:14:58,420
Just shit in bags have been awesome.
I just.

1608
01:14:58,600 --> 01:15:03,310
The idea of Saran wrap a guy's head here
so far.

1609
01:15:03,390 --> 01:15:06,430
So is this guy crawling around as she 
does her stuff?

1610
01:15:06,460 --> 01:15:08,570
Yeah,
it's in the kitchen or just follow.

1611
01:15:08,571 --> 01:15:12,400
He needs those sliders on his knee and 
she's a really good idea.

1612
01:15:12,430 --> 01:15:15,720
We should suggest that maybe.
And we've played a lot of uh,

1613
01:15:17,670 --> 01:15:22,670
I'm going to email this guy.
Well I have these Omni Directional 

1614
01:15:22,670 --> 01:15:22,670
sliders that are workout with or do abs 
with them.

1615
01:15:22,670 --> 01:15:23,800
You know,
slide.

1616
01:15:23,830 --> 01:15:26,170
You can do this way.
Do your timers with them.

1617
01:15:26,210 --> 01:15:27,880
They do all kinds of different shit.
Yeah.

1618
01:15:27,881 --> 01:15:32,881
You can put those on.
The guys need just fart all around the 

1619
01:15:32,881 --> 01:15:33,590
house.
Hardwood floors.

1620
01:15:33,940 --> 01:15:36,940
Have you seen King Ash rippers work?
Excuse me?

1621
01:15:38,930 --> 01:15:42,400
What is Scott?
We've reached out a lot.

1622
01:15:42,430 --> 01:15:44,440
Offered him money and he bought.
Yes.

1623
01:15:44,560 --> 01:15:47,660
Just because he's such a creative guy.
We talked maybe.

1624
01:15:48,110 --> 01:15:53,110
Maybe the great king asked ripper the 
ripper.

1625
01:15:53,221 --> 01:15:57,610
Yeah.
Harry and grows the Lord of all farts.

1626
01:15:57,611 --> 01:16:00,880
And gluttony,
he makes videos of him.

1627
01:16:01,030 --> 01:16:03,620
This is him king asked her,
please give me some

1628
01:16:03,720 --> 01:16:08,720
volume that's still moving.
Oh,

1629
01:16:16,060 --> 01:16:17,750
go to rip.
Massive.

1630
01:16:18,400 --> 01:16:19,070
Go to ripon.

1631
01:16:24,110 --> 01:16:24,930
Hold on.
Oh,

1632
01:16:24,950 --> 01:16:27,220
because he has an opus.
This is just one of many.

1633
01:16:27,370 --> 01:16:28,430
But his pants.
Yeah,

1634
01:16:28,431 --> 01:16:33,431
he does.
It's getting brown.

1635
01:16:36,710 --> 01:16:41,710
Hundred Ninety $9,000.
How many fucking standup bits online of 

1636
01:16:41,830 --> 01:16:43,320
100.
Ninety $9,000

1637
01:16:52,660 --> 01:16:56,610
to glutton thing?

1638
01:17:03,450 --> 01:17:05,080
No.
About them.

1639
01:17:05,650 --> 01:17:10,650
We've studied his work forever.
Looking at Brown is good back there.

1640
01:17:18,500 --> 01:17:22,550
Making money from this.
He should be making millions of ads.

1641
01:17:22,820 --> 01:17:23,970
He's got to be making money.
If it's not,

1642
01:17:23,980 --> 01:17:25,480
it's got this.
Here's the thing.

1643
01:17:25,740 --> 01:17:27,790
So does he have ads?
I like it.

1644
01:17:27,830 --> 01:17:32,830
He's just checking every ads.
What's in the micro likes to stage the 

1645
01:17:33,831 --> 01:17:34,580
scene with

1646
01:17:54,340 --> 01:17:56,230
his underwear drawer.
Dude,

1647
01:17:57,880 --> 01:18:02,880
he's got some that are so clearly.
There's a Christmas one too.

1648
01:18:05,081 --> 01:18:07,130
Hairy.
Gross Slob is.

1649
01:18:07,131 --> 01:18:08,890
Is fucked him.
Yeah.

1650
01:18:08,891 --> 01:18:09,940
He.
Oh my God.

1651
01:18:09,941 --> 01:18:12,910
Look at what he fucking videos he has 
with his.

1652
01:18:13,210 --> 01:18:15,880
So many.
But he has to go to this one is not much

1653
01:18:15,970 --> 01:18:20,970
sausage.
Gravy gluck is he'll watched you get to 

1654
01:18:20,970 --> 01:18:23,881
watch a meat throw up,
but I'm still alive.

1655
01:18:27,821 --> 01:18:30,790
Is coming to the surface as Christmas 
one.

1656
01:18:31,910 --> 01:18:34,210
Fucking Christmas.
Special special.

1657
01:18:34,211 --> 01:18:39,211
We uh,
we found it on is because his live link 

1658
01:18:39,211 --> 01:18:42,961
account is.
He has a lot on live leak from youtube 

1659
01:18:42,961 --> 01:18:45,060
because youtube will take them down.
So lively arts,

1660
01:18:45,490 --> 01:18:50,490
it's just not apparently.
Maybe it gets flagged a lot on a lively,

1661
01:18:50,800 --> 01:18:52,240
lively.
It's like bring it on dude.

1662
01:18:52,300 --> 01:18:54,380
Someone's mom sees it.
What is you,

1663
01:18:54,550 --> 01:18:56,090
what is my son being gay?

1664
01:19:01,980 --> 01:19:02,370
That's

1665
01:19:02,440 --> 01:19:04,210
mothering.
Mothering.

1666
01:19:04,770 --> 01:19:09,770
Well,
we were talking a lot about crazy 

1667
01:19:09,770 --> 01:19:10,350
mother.
Slightly over parenting.

1668
01:19:10,351 --> 01:19:14,740
Yeah.
Well he wasn't parents and this guy,

1669
01:19:15,200 --> 01:19:17,640
this guy is getting.
Maybe it was too much.

1670
01:19:18,330 --> 01:19:20,150
Maybe like rebellion,
right.

1671
01:19:20,400 --> 01:19:22,950
Hates Mommy.
Imagine if his mom finds out about this.

1672
01:19:23,690 --> 01:19:28,650
I think he lives at home still because 
we've studied the videos and it seems as

1673
01:19:28,651 --> 01:19:33,651
though these are like prior to that 
location there was one that was just a 

1674
01:19:33,651 --> 01:19:38,001
bedroom in a basement and I think he 
actually did live with his folks and 

1675
01:19:38,001 --> 01:19:41,840
we've deduced that this might be like a 
fetish thing because it's gluttony.

1676
01:19:42,030 --> 01:19:47,030
And then farts and he won't answer any 
other tweets that people just bombard 

1677
01:19:48,421 --> 01:19:53,421
him with him because he put an email in 
one and we will on our show where like 

1678
01:19:53,421 --> 01:19:53,670
everybody,
even unlike no response.

1679
01:19:53,710 --> 01:19:55,290
So if you could get to the bottom of 
this,

1680
01:19:55,291 --> 01:19:56,230
we'd really appreciate it.

1681
01:19:56,270 --> 01:20:01,270
I don't want to because I'm terrified.
One day he'll be in here in the morning 

1682
01:20:01,270 --> 01:20:02,940
and my fucking Ergonomic chairs,
the family,

1683
01:20:02,941 --> 01:20:07,050
the family thing also is because on the 
Christmas one you can tell it's a family

1684
01:20:07,590 --> 01:20:10,890
and there's stockings up and he farts 
and every stocking.

1685
01:20:12,380 --> 01:20:17,380
Then he goes,
that's what you get from king as rip a 

1686
01:20:17,380 --> 01:20:20,690
merry Christmas represents coast is 
probably going to die.

1687
01:20:20,701 --> 01:20:22,260
Probably there's something wrong with 
his colon.

1688
01:20:22,420 --> 01:20:27,420
That's an interesting theory too.
And people have also brought about the 

1689
01:20:27,420 --> 01:20:31,050
theory that he is doing that pushing air
in there,

1690
01:20:31,470 --> 01:20:32,020
you know,
using.

1691
01:20:32,100 --> 01:20:33,300
It's cheating,
he's cheating.

1692
01:20:33,460 --> 01:20:38,460
Believe like filling himself with air 
and then forgetting it because there's 

1693
01:20:38,460 --> 01:20:41,250
no edits between each fart assumed that 
he can't fart.

1694
01:20:41,251 --> 01:20:43,410
Rapid fire that loud.
I mean you'd.

1695
01:20:43,770 --> 01:20:46,230
You'd have to be some sort of a bag of 
wind,

1696
01:20:46,290 --> 01:20:51,290
like a bad because sometimes I mean 
regular fresh,

1697
01:20:51,341 --> 01:20:54,010
like Oh,
little farts.

1698
01:20:54,050 --> 01:20:56,760
Smell like sounded like last night I 
thought yesterday.

1699
01:20:56,761 --> 01:20:57,720
I,
you know,

1700
01:20:57,721 --> 01:21:01,440
when you stay away from seafood for 
awhile and then you reintroduce it,

1701
01:21:01,740 --> 01:21:03,390
there's bacteria in like,
you know,

1702
01:21:03,410 --> 01:21:08,200
it's different in shellfish and Sushi.
And I thought when I,

1703
01:21:08,230 --> 01:21:13,230
yesterday when I farted,
it sounded like somebody was throwing 

1704
01:21:13,230 --> 01:21:13,230
up,
sounded like a guy going,

1705
01:21:14,040 --> 01:21:17,700
you know,
I've only shaved my ass once in my life,

1706
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:19,980
but once I did,
oh my God,

1707
01:21:19,981 --> 01:21:21,990
my fart sounded so different.
Really?

1708
01:21:22,060 --> 01:21:27,060
Oh,
they were all like wet and sloppy hair 

1709
01:21:27,060 --> 01:21:27,060
kind of different.
You're,

1710
01:21:27,060 --> 01:21:28,350
you're,
you're the hair on your ass.

1711
01:21:28,560 --> 01:21:31,320
Literally changes the way your farts 
smell or sound rather.

1712
01:21:31,340 --> 01:21:32,550
Right?
Smell this smell the same,

1713
01:21:32,760 --> 01:21:33,900
but they sound different.

1714
01:21:36,460 --> 01:21:38,080
Flop,
flop,

1715
01:21:38,100 --> 01:21:39,020
flop,
flop.

1716
01:21:42,100 --> 01:21:44,490
Something tells me King Asher but 
doesn't shave.

1717
01:21:44,770 --> 01:21:46,680
That's a whole new area he could get 
into.

1718
01:21:46,690 --> 01:21:51,690
That's a whole monster.
Dating that guy now he doesn't have a 

1719
01:21:53,400 --> 01:21:58,400
girlfriend.
Girlfriend breaks up his youtube ad 

1720
01:21:59,190 --> 01:22:01,860
video money then.
Then he gets a hooker.

1721
01:22:01,970 --> 01:22:05,520
Interesting farts on her.
Like,

1722
01:22:05,521 --> 01:22:08,270
no,
I hate it was a fucking loser.

1723
01:22:10,630 --> 01:22:13,950
My videos.
I'm like,

1724
01:22:16,330 --> 01:22:17,120
no,
you don't.

1725
01:22:17,121 --> 01:22:18,510
I don't have the Internet.
Shut up.

1726
01:22:22,210 --> 01:22:25,840
What the fuck someone's babies from when
I was a little baby.

1727
01:22:26,400 --> 01:22:28,740
That's what you have to be.
Your son.

1728
01:22:28,770 --> 01:22:31,020
Could be our son for sure.
It could be our son,

1729
01:22:31,370 --> 01:22:34,710
my favorite clothes.
Like take the throne for new.

1730
01:22:34,860 --> 01:22:37,370
The new king.
I'll tell Hilton,

1731
01:22:37,371 --> 01:22:39,270
the new king.
I want them to go toe to toe.

1732
01:22:39,300 --> 01:22:44,300
I hope.
I hope he takes it from one day to the 

1733
01:22:44,300 --> 01:22:44,300
next level.
It's like,

1734
01:22:44,300 --> 01:22:46,740
what is it about farts?
So they're so hilarious.

1735
01:22:48,740 --> 01:22:53,740
They're never not funny.
They're never not entertaining because 

1736
01:22:53,740 --> 01:22:56,631
there are so taboo.
You're supposed to do them in front of 

1737
01:22:56,631 --> 01:22:56,631
strangers.
The smell,

1738
01:22:56,631 --> 01:23:00,350
the sound,
everything about it and the pain.

1739
01:23:00,970 --> 01:23:03,210
The people that love them versus don't 
like it.

1740
01:23:03,270 --> 01:23:05,600
I think those are all rooted in if your 
house

1741
01:23:06,260 --> 01:23:09,670
was okay with or not,
he had none growing up.

1742
01:23:09,671 --> 01:23:14,090
So that's why were were euro trash.
So we loved farts and poopies parts.

1743
01:23:14,320 --> 01:23:15,790
Was it talked about in your house,
was it.

1744
01:23:15,810 --> 01:23:16,410
No,
no,

1745
01:23:16,460 --> 01:23:21,460
no.
My house was lacking in any sense of 

1746
01:23:21,460 --> 01:23:21,460
humor.
Really?

1747
01:23:21,750 --> 01:23:22,870
Yeah.
No one was funny.

1748
01:23:23,220 --> 01:23:25,210
No one knows funny.
No one had any.

1749
01:23:25,410 --> 01:23:26,650
Never.
Everyone was like,

1750
01:23:26,680 --> 01:23:29,070
don't be a loser.
Stop being a loser,

1751
01:23:29,980 --> 01:23:31,390
a loser.
It was always,

1752
01:23:31,391 --> 01:23:33,660
you're going to be a loser.
Your grades suck.

1753
01:23:33,670 --> 01:23:38,670
You're going to be skewed.
I'm still coughing from the sublime 

1754
01:23:38,670 --> 01:23:39,080
parts.
Um,

1755
01:23:40,060 --> 01:23:41,850
I literally almost threw up when he was 
eating,

1756
01:23:42,090 --> 01:23:44,440
when he was eating the hotdogs,
dogs and sausage and the gravy,

1757
01:23:44,740 --> 01:23:47,350
like saliva was coming to the surface in
my throat.

1758
01:23:47,351 --> 01:23:51,460
Now I'm dealing with sometimes he farts 
on what he's going to.

1759
01:23:57,600 --> 01:24:02,600
He's like five little.
Debbie's 12 of them and then you're 

1760
01:24:05,511 --> 01:24:05,970
like,
alright.

1761
01:24:06,050 --> 01:24:09,810
And he turns around.
He's like mo foreign on him and he hates

1762
01:24:09,880 --> 01:24:14,880
them.
He's got to be eating some of his own 

1763
01:24:14,880 --> 01:24:15,540
shit.
Right?

1764
01:24:15,710 --> 01:24:18,740
The first video where he gets up bucket.
Okay.

1765
01:24:18,741 --> 01:24:22,610
IFC and dips.
Every fried piece in Mayo.

1766
01:24:22,670 --> 01:24:27,670
And he said,
who's that guy that's so crazy is

1767
01:24:41,080 --> 01:24:44,310
all wrong.
All wrong in every way.

1768
01:24:44,800 --> 01:24:49,800
I do kind of look.
There was a time where our listeners 

1769
01:24:49,800 --> 01:24:50,010
thought that I might get this away.
Him James.

1770
01:24:50,220 --> 01:24:55,220
I was literally almost threw up.
There is a,

1771
01:24:55,330 --> 01:24:57,100
there is one we want to describe 
anything.

1772
01:24:57,101 --> 01:24:58,630
There's nothing gross about this 
description,

1773
01:24:58,631 --> 01:25:01,930
but one time because he's a good eater.
He's like,

1774
01:25:02,080 --> 01:25:07,080
I got eight sausage and egg mcmuffin and
then he's.

1775
01:25:08,920 --> 01:25:10,090
He's,
he's tallying it.

1776
01:25:10,260 --> 01:25:15,260
He's like diesel,
250 calories and then I got a egg and 

1777
01:25:16,271 --> 01:25:18,670
cheese.
Three hundred calories.

1778
01:25:18,880 --> 01:25:23,880
Nine of those.
You do the math because he wants you to 

1779
01:25:25,481 --> 01:25:28,650
know how many calories he's eating,
but he's not that fat.

1780
01:25:28,660 --> 01:25:30,700
It just know God is good.
God on him.

1781
01:25:30,701 --> 01:25:31,540
Yeah.
It's not like he's.

1782
01:25:31,880 --> 01:25:36,880
He doesn't have some sort of.
Ralphie may thing going on remarkably 

1783
01:25:36,880 --> 01:25:36,880
obese.
Sadly.

1784
01:25:36,880 --> 01:25:41,341
That guy lives his life like absolute 
shit every day and I'm fatter than him,

1785
01:25:41,940 --> 01:25:45,970
but he definitely does not give a fuck 
ever.

1786
01:25:46,350 --> 01:25:48,910
He's not that attache,
but you think that's an act?

1787
01:25:48,911 --> 01:25:53,911
I mean maybe some customer service 
representative for like tow Toyo tires 

1788
01:25:53,911 --> 01:25:53,911
or something.

1789
01:25:53,911 --> 01:25:54,990
Joe.
I might agree.

1790
01:25:55,020 --> 01:25:59,880
Have I not watched many of his films and
going over the data?

1791
01:25:59,910 --> 01:26:04,070
The footage for about a year?
Probably a long

1792
01:26:04,070 --> 01:26:06,370
time with King.
He claims to be in Michigan by the way,

1793
01:26:06,380 --> 01:26:08,420
a to be a Michigan guy.
How long have you been doing this?

1794
01:26:08,890 --> 01:26:13,890
A few years.
So do you think he tentatively dipping 

1795
01:26:13,890 --> 01:26:17,920
his toes into the pool of asphalt videos
or did he just fucking decide he's the 

1796
01:26:17,920 --> 01:26:19,490
king.
He calls himself.

1797
01:26:19,491 --> 01:26:21,680
He's the king from the jump though.
I mean,

1798
01:26:21,681 --> 01:26:25,310
did you go back to the library earlier 
videos where he's like,

1799
01:26:25,311 --> 01:26:27,260
I challenge anybody to Fart.
Like I can't.

1800
01:26:27,261 --> 01:26:28,850
Like he really,
he owns us.

1801
01:26:30,050 --> 01:26:32,670
He farts on his haters,
his haters.

1802
01:26:32,671 --> 01:26:34,870
He shows his face too.
He doesn't.

1803
01:26:35,410 --> 01:26:38,100
He gets recognized.
Yes.

1804
01:26:38,240 --> 01:26:43,240
Do you think that he,
like one day he's at golden corral and 

1805
01:26:43,240 --> 01:26:45,881
then like cats,
you chain getting shrimp nibblers I 

1806
01:26:46,820 --> 01:26:49,040
think I'm going to go out on a limb 
here.

1807
01:26:50,960 --> 01:26:55,960
I'm going to go out on a limb and think 
and say that I don't know if he's all 

1808
01:26:55,960 --> 01:26:55,960
mentally.

1809
01:26:55,960 --> 01:26:58,010
Well,
I think I've taken a big leap.

1810
01:26:58,630 --> 01:27:01,080
I think if you do a pro,
you like your king and he was like,

1811
01:27:04,930 --> 01:27:07,010
in my face,
please sir,

1812
01:27:08,140 --> 01:27:13,140
your grace.
I would like to go and and serious and 

1813
01:27:13,140 --> 01:27:13,150
be like,
dude,

1814
01:27:13,280 --> 01:27:15,490
I can park bigger than you any day like 
that,

1815
01:27:15,520 --> 01:27:16,370
you know?
And have them be like,

1816
01:27:17,720 --> 01:27:20,210
I'm the king dude named spot.
Well,

1817
01:27:20,211 --> 01:27:22,250
what if you can only fight on his own?
What if like,

1818
01:27:22,251 --> 01:27:23,900
if you challenge him,
he just locks up.

1819
01:27:24,610 --> 01:27:28,640
It's interesting.
Maybe get stagefright wow.

1820
01:27:28,700 --> 01:27:32,480
Twice does it all alone and his kitchen 
a stage somewhere and he doesn't respond

1821
01:27:32,481 --> 01:27:33,830
to the emails.
Let me ask you this.

1822
01:27:34,160 --> 01:27:38,840
If that guy put on a show somewhere like
he had a small club in Chicago,

1823
01:27:39,700 --> 01:27:41,250
some 150 seats.
Yeah.

1824
01:27:41,720 --> 01:27:44,630
Do you think he could fill a place?
You think you'd get 100 people in there?

1825
01:27:44,631 --> 01:27:49,631
I would endorse to go buy a ticket.
I can make some money if you fart like 

1826
01:27:50,000 --> 01:27:51,530
that all the time.
It could make some money.

1827
01:27:51,680 --> 01:27:53,570
I mean that's why I like him to contact 
us.

1828
01:27:54,500 --> 01:27:57,080
We can have them open for your mom's 
house podcast.

1829
01:27:57,700 --> 01:28:02,700
No,
you couldn't eat shit on your 

1830
01:28:02,700 --> 01:28:02,700
microphone.

1831
01:28:04,790 --> 01:28:06,280
Sorry.
No.

1832
01:28:06,380 --> 01:28:08,960
When you try to clean it up and do your 
show.

1833
01:28:09,010 --> 01:28:13,310
The whole audit Straw.
I'm starting to throw,

1834
01:28:13,311 --> 01:28:15,750
everybody would get so fed.
Oh,

1835
01:28:15,780 --> 01:28:18,350
we thought it was going to be cool.
It's got shit everywhere.

1836
01:28:21,990 --> 01:28:26,990
Well,
we'd always heard growing up there was 

1837
01:28:26,990 --> 01:28:27,500
always the stories about the famous 
people that like to get shit on.

1838
01:28:27,840 --> 01:28:30,670
Right.
Saran wrap or Kelly likes to be peed on.

1839
01:28:30,920 --> 01:28:32,090
Oh,
like to pee on.

1840
01:28:32,091 --> 01:28:33,710
I'm sorry guys.
I'm sorry.

1841
01:28:33,870 --> 01:28:38,870
We should.
We should preface that with the word 

1842
01:28:38,870 --> 01:28:38,870
allegedly.
Allegedly.

1843
01:28:38,870 --> 01:28:38,870
That's not me.
That's not me.

1844
01:28:38,870 --> 01:28:43,700
It's not amazing.
When when our Kelly was going through 

1845
01:28:43,700 --> 01:28:46,391
all that,
the black community did not abandoned 

1846
01:28:46,391 --> 01:28:49,050
him for a God damn second.
A great song.

1847
01:28:49,051 --> 01:28:50,210
So yeah.
But they,

1848
01:28:50,260 --> 01:28:52,070
they,
they were like whatever.

1849
01:28:52,490 --> 01:28:54,470
They like never.
They never like,

1850
01:28:54,500 --> 01:28:56,810
there was no blow back.
They're very forgiving.

1851
01:28:56,811 --> 01:29:00,030
I mean even Michael Jackson know you 
look at that thing,

1852
01:29:00,080 --> 01:29:05,080
but dad wasn't really the black 
community as much as it was like white 

1853
01:29:05,080 --> 01:29:05,080
Weirdos.

1854
01:29:05,460 --> 01:29:08,940
That's interesting.
Michael Jackson,

1855
01:29:08,941 --> 01:29:11,220
like if you look at the hordes of 
Michael Jackson fans,

1856
01:29:11,460 --> 01:29:16,460
a lot of them are like,
I went to this twitter page the other 

1857
01:29:16,460 --> 01:29:18,831
day,
like somebody tweeted something like 

1858
01:29:18,831 --> 01:29:18,831
really bizarre to me,
and I was like,

1859
01:29:18,831 --> 01:29:18,930
well,
this is a fucking idiot,

1860
01:29:19,260 --> 01:29:24,260
and so when someone anything off,
I immediately go to their twitter page 

1861
01:29:24,260 --> 01:29:24,260
and I go,
okay,

1862
01:29:24,260 --> 01:29:25,620
what are you up to?
What are you into?

1863
01:29:25,800 --> 01:29:30,800
And this lady was a Michael Jackson 
fanatic and she had like one I was here 

1864
01:29:30,800 --> 01:29:31,860
and the other guy,
the other,

1865
01:29:31,861 --> 01:29:35,230
I was just like slightly wonky,
not like super obvious,

1866
01:29:35,630 --> 01:29:38,840
a little wonky and her entire page,
her,

1867
01:29:38,880 --> 01:29:39,380
her,
her,

1868
01:29:39,450 --> 01:29:44,450
the header of her twitter page was all 
Michael Jackson pictures or collage of 

1869
01:29:44,450 --> 01:29:46,170
Michael Jackson pictures.
All of her.

1870
01:29:46,171 --> 01:29:48,450
Like you look at media,
you click on media.

1871
01:29:48,650 --> 01:29:50,160
Oliver media was,
you know,

1872
01:29:50,161 --> 01:29:52,640
the king rip to the King of Pop.

1873
01:29:52,660 --> 01:29:54,030
I could sing,
did some dancing,

1874
01:29:54,630 --> 01:29:56,400
wacky white people.
I love him.

1875
01:29:56,490 --> 01:29:59,460
Eastern Europeans.
Remember towards the end of his career,

1876
01:29:59,610 --> 01:30:01,650
that's what it really came out to see 
him.

1877
01:30:01,651 --> 01:30:04,290
Like he would tour like Budapest and 
they will love you.

1878
01:30:04,340 --> 01:30:09,340
Michael.
Do Stadium so well that's because it 

1879
01:30:09,340 --> 01:30:13,461
takes time to trickle into fit.
Didn't hear about the fuck what fucking 

1880
01:30:14,600 --> 01:30:18,710
the kids kind of.
Some guys a weird fucking deal.

1881
01:30:18,810 --> 01:30:21,360
Gypsies.
Remember when he moved to Dubai?

1882
01:30:21,480 --> 01:30:23,430
Yes.
That was weird.

1883
01:30:23,720 --> 01:30:27,690
I remember I remember because I went to 
visit there and they were like,

1884
01:30:27,691 --> 01:30:30,270
this is where Michael Jackson state.
And I was like,

1885
01:30:30,271 --> 01:30:33,870
why are you telling them no one cares?
He lived in the Middle East for why?

1886
01:30:33,900 --> 01:30:36,880
Because you could just fuck kids there.
I think just to get away from it all and

1887
01:30:37,000 --> 01:30:39,480
get away from the,
from the circus that was back here.

1888
01:30:39,660 --> 01:30:44,660
But I remember there was a video or 
photos of him like with like a full 

1889
01:30:44,660 --> 01:30:47,190
fucking head scarf,
like covering his face and he had like a

1890
01:30:47,191 --> 01:30:47,730
kid with him.

1891
01:30:48,390 --> 01:30:49,230
I'm like,
whoa.

1892
01:30:49,260 --> 01:30:51,120
Like how much does this guy like fucking
kids.

1893
01:30:51,390 --> 01:30:53,910
He likes the kids more than he likes 
living in America.

1894
01:30:55,270 --> 01:30:56,730
You got to give up a lot.
Yeah,

1895
01:30:56,780 --> 01:30:59,050
there he is.
Look,

1896
01:30:59,150 --> 01:31:01,730
he's taking a kid with them.
What the fuck?

1897
01:31:01,731 --> 01:31:03,780
That might be his kid,
man.

1898
01:31:04,080 --> 01:31:04,980
Yeah,
because he had the.

1899
01:31:05,010 --> 01:31:05,980
He had three.
Yeah.

1900
01:31:06,000 --> 01:31:11,000
But he's only got one.
There were the other one to talk too 

1901
01:31:11,000 --> 01:31:11,100
much in the car.
Oh,

1902
01:31:11,360 --> 01:31:16,360
you could see his little white socks 
that he used to wear his black slip ons 

1903
01:31:16,360 --> 01:31:17,330
and the kid is wearing a mass to walk.
Yeah,

1904
01:31:17,530 --> 01:31:20,660
that's what a strange.
Strange.

1905
01:31:21,390 --> 01:31:22,800
I'm sorry though.
I,

1906
01:31:22,801 --> 01:31:24,870
I dive.
I digressed here.

1907
01:31:24,900 --> 01:31:29,900
Who likes to be shit on specifically was
always a talk about Sylvester stallone.

1908
01:31:30,840 --> 01:31:34,350
You still like to climb under tables,
clear glass tables and watch girls shit.

1909
01:31:34,590 --> 01:31:36,750
But that could be total bullshit.

1910
01:31:36,870 --> 01:31:39,410
That could be just someone makes it up,
you know?

1911
01:31:39,420 --> 01:31:41,340
It's like the Richard Gere durable 
thing.

1912
01:31:41,510 --> 01:31:45,030
I would not be surprised if Richard Gere
has never had a dribble up his ass.

1913
01:31:45,170 --> 01:31:47,430
Yeah.
But almost everyone heard that story.

1914
01:31:47,460 --> 01:31:50,800
I definitely heard that story before the
Internet two,

1915
01:31:51,460 --> 01:31:56,370
which is the crazy thing about it.
How it took off without somebody sending

1916
01:31:56,371 --> 01:31:58,800
an email or allegedly.
Allegedly.

1917
01:31:58,830 --> 01:32:00,940
The rumor is that that was the 
scientology thing.

1918
01:32:01,740 --> 01:32:03,730
Is that Richard Gear to get some dirt on
you?

1919
01:32:03,731 --> 01:32:04,350
Yes.
Well,

1920
01:32:04,351 --> 01:32:06,640
not even get dirt on.
You just treat you like shit because you

1921
01:32:06,641 --> 01:32:11,641
left the organization.
Then he left and then they spread that 

1922
01:32:11,641 --> 01:32:11,641
rumor.
Yeah.

1923
01:32:11,641 --> 01:32:15,240
That was the rumor.
See if was an article on that and 

1924
01:32:15,240 --> 01:32:15,240
interesting.
Jamie.

1925
01:32:15,240 --> 01:32:16,260
You know,
it's funny that you were saying the uh,

1926
01:32:16,490 --> 01:32:21,490
how the uh,
black community didn't give any shit to 

1927
01:32:21,490 --> 01:32:23,120
r Kelly.
There was also a big push back,

1928
01:32:23,310 --> 01:32:26,470
at least I noticed when it was first 
going up the cosby scandal.

1929
01:32:26,710 --> 01:32:30,260
A lot of people like being like,
why are you trying to tear this guy down

1930
01:32:31,140 --> 01:32:32,800
in,
in their defense,

1931
01:32:32,920 --> 01:32:37,920
if you looked at it from the point of 
view of someone who looks towards black 

1932
01:32:38,081 --> 01:32:43,081
heroes and icons,
you have a few hundred percent get a 

1933
01:32:43,340 --> 01:32:44,980
cosby.
And they were like,

1934
01:32:45,040 --> 01:32:45,640
oh,
you know,

1935
01:32:45,641 --> 01:32:48,190
these white bitches trying to take down 
our man.

1936
01:32:48,220 --> 01:32:49,750
That's how they,
that's how it was perceived.

1937
01:32:50,040 --> 01:32:53,320
That totally got that integrity of the 
few heroes you have.

1938
01:32:53,380 --> 01:32:58,380
But he was the most celebrated,
like cross over just a revered older 

1939
01:32:59,171 --> 01:33:01,540
wise,
lovable father figure.

1940
01:33:01,570 --> 01:33:04,000
So it was like you're talking shit about
like,

1941
01:33:04,030 --> 01:33:06,820
it's like you were talking shit about 
somebody's grandfather,

1942
01:33:07,320 --> 01:33:08,630
you know.
Yeah.

1943
01:33:08,990 --> 01:33:09,880
It's just,
it's,

1944
01:33:10,200 --> 01:33:12,970
it's so weird to think that all that 
time,

1945
01:33:13,180 --> 01:33:15,750
like some people knew and they were 
like,

1946
01:33:15,880 --> 01:33:17,190
shh,
shh.

1947
01:33:17,290 --> 01:33:20,280
It's like a vampire was living there.
Yeah,

1948
01:33:20,290 --> 01:33:20,800
it was crazy.

1949
01:33:21,870 --> 01:33:23,610
Now,
do we know what the numbers are?

1950
01:33:23,620 --> 01:33:25,270
30.
I think it's more than that.

1951
01:33:25,480 --> 01:33:27,880
Is it more than that?
Jesus Christ?

1952
01:33:27,970 --> 01:33:32,970
Yeah.
I think the alleged the alleged 

1953
01:33:32,970 --> 01:33:33,970
incidents or are up in the high forties 
at this point in time.

1954
01:33:34,000 --> 01:33:36,430
If I was one of his victims,
I would just keep my mouth shut.

1955
01:33:36,460 --> 01:33:37,960
I'll be like,
there's enough evidence.

1956
01:33:38,170 --> 01:33:40,540
I don't need the whole world to know 
that.

1957
01:33:40,630 --> 01:33:43,600
Bill cosby drugged did it to me too.
It's pretty,

1958
01:33:43,601 --> 01:33:46,570
pretty crazy.
He's got a wonky eye now too,

1959
01:33:46,571 --> 01:33:47,970
right?
He does have a wonky eye.

1960
01:33:48,000 --> 01:33:49,390
He's got,
he's got glaucoma,

1961
01:33:51,700 --> 01:33:54,000
but he has a wonky eye.
Like one turns to the side.

1962
01:33:54,010 --> 01:33:56,170
One of them doesn't move as much as the 
other one.

1963
01:33:56,171 --> 01:33:58,520
Yeah.
It's just the hate inside of his body.

1964
01:34:01,230 --> 01:34:05,770
His eyes go wonky or the denial of his 
own evil.

1965
01:34:05,830 --> 01:34:08,530
I mean guys,
gotTa be fucked in the head.

1966
01:34:08,620 --> 01:34:13,620
I mean there's just no getting around 
that and his head's got to be all kinds 

1967
01:34:13,620 --> 01:34:14,620
of fucked up.
It is the best by the way though,

1968
01:34:14,621 --> 01:34:19,050
like if you're looking at it from your 
building a like a,

1969
01:34:19,430 --> 01:34:24,430
a case to want to get away with 
something horrible and you need a great 

1970
01:34:24,910 --> 01:34:27,370
like alibi,
a great persona to get away with it.

1971
01:34:27,610 --> 01:34:32,610
There's nothing better than what he's 
designed to get away if he's this 

1972
01:34:32,610 --> 01:34:36,400
criminal cause you're like family guy.
Yeah.

1973
01:34:36,750 --> 01:34:41,750
It's like a mastermind criminal stuff.
Really find that almost all the self 

1974
01:34:41,750 --> 01:34:44,680
righteous people who really like,
look at all those pastors.

1975
01:34:44,920 --> 01:34:46,170
Fucking assholes.
Yeah.

1976
01:34:47,860 --> 01:34:51,070
Hating gays and all this and look what a
nightmare they were.

1977
01:34:51,071 --> 01:34:52,580
Ted Haggard,
same thing.

1978
01:34:54,010 --> 01:34:56,560
The ones who preached the most and he 
would do that a lot.

1979
01:34:56,890 --> 01:34:59,540
He would lecture people,
especially black people.

1980
01:34:59,541 --> 01:35:01,370
He wasn't actually that much.
Well that's,

1981
01:35:01,400 --> 01:35:03,500
that's.
I mean he made it into Eddie Murphy Raw.

1982
01:35:03,920 --> 01:35:06,340
Remember he made it,
made it into that space.

1983
01:35:06,910 --> 01:35:08,480
Was delirious,
delirious.

1984
01:35:09,280 --> 01:35:10,770
Filled,
delirious.

1985
01:35:11,150 --> 01:35:13,830
I think it was delirious.
I got a call from bill cosby.

1986
01:35:14,060 --> 01:35:15,910
Clean up the bar.
Yeah.

1987
01:35:16,720 --> 01:35:19,190
Yeah.
But how weird.

1988
01:35:19,860 --> 01:35:21,970
How strange,
but like what you were saying,

1989
01:35:22,000 --> 01:35:24,110
you don't trust comics and we'll talk 
about their dicks.

1990
01:35:24,111 --> 01:35:29,111
You don't trust people that they don't 
tell you the truth about how they feel 

1991
01:35:29,111 --> 01:35:29,111
about things.
You know,

1992
01:35:29,440 --> 01:35:31,940
what's,
why the need to conceal either.

1993
01:35:31,941 --> 01:35:35,810
There's a tremendous amount of shame.
They're kind of bullshit,

1994
01:35:35,990 --> 01:35:40,990
but that's how I am with people.
I judge people like that because I'm 

1995
01:35:40,990 --> 01:35:42,560
eastern blocking and that's how we 
communicate in my family.

1996
01:35:42,980 --> 01:35:44,590
Yeah.
I don't.

1997
01:35:44,600 --> 01:35:45,450
I don't know.
But then,

1998
01:35:45,451 --> 01:35:50,451
you know,
I don't trust people that are overly 

1999
01:35:50,451 --> 01:35:50,451
nice.

2000
01:35:50,451 --> 01:35:53,620
Seinfeld,
Seinfeld never give anybody a hard time 

2001
01:35:53,620 --> 01:35:55,220
about their act mean he's friends with 
Chris Rock,

2002
01:35:55,310 --> 01:36:00,310
good friends.
He's got this style of comedy that he 

2003
01:36:00,310 --> 01:36:00,920
enjoys,
but he's also a master at it.

2004
01:36:00,980 --> 01:36:02,810
You know,
he's a master wordsmith.

2005
01:36:02,840 --> 01:36:04,170
You know,
it's like these,

2006
01:36:04,190 --> 01:36:04,880
these,
these,

2007
01:36:04,970 --> 01:36:06,830
these jokes are like songs,
you know,

2008
01:36:06,831 --> 01:36:10,430
he's got them down to a science,
but who knows.

2009
01:36:10,431 --> 01:36:11,830
I don't think he's a darn.
Oh,

2010
01:36:12,860 --> 01:36:14,420
he's the exception to my,
uh,

2011
01:36:14,500 --> 01:36:18,800
my gross generalization about dudes who 
don't come from a different era,

2012
01:36:19,580 --> 01:36:20,690
you know?
Yep.

2013
01:36:20,860 --> 01:36:25,860
I thought it was interesting with him 
was when he was getting a hard time 

2014
01:36:25,860 --> 01:36:27,380
recently about the PC adversity.
Yeah.

2015
01:36:27,410 --> 01:36:32,410
About.
Well that was more recently have 

2016
01:36:32,410 --> 01:36:32,410
diversity on a show.
Oh right.

2017
01:36:32,480 --> 01:36:36,030
God Damn fucking coffee makes no,
no.

2018
01:36:36,110 --> 01:36:38,720
His new show.
His comedians in cars.

2019
01:36:39,940 --> 01:36:44,940
Yeah.
Why can't he have his buddies on where 

2020
01:36:44,940 --> 01:36:44,940
they were saying,
well,

2021
01:36:44,940 --> 01:36:45,020
how come there's no diversity?

2022
01:36:45,140 --> 01:36:46,250
And he was like,
I don't,

2023
01:36:46,580 --> 01:36:48,710
I don't speak that language.
I speak the language of funny,

2024
01:36:48,950 --> 01:36:50,660
like if they're funny,
I want them on.

2025
01:36:50,870 --> 01:36:55,870
And people were listening to that 
explanation and I was listening to all 

2026
01:36:55,870 --> 01:37:00,071
these dummies,
these fucking dummies that were 

2027
01:37:00,071 --> 01:37:00,071
commenting on it.
They're like,

2028
01:37:00,071 --> 01:37:02,330
that sounds racist to me.
That sounds racist.

2029
01:37:02,331 --> 01:37:05,420
I don't know what I heard,
but I heard that sounds racist,

2030
01:37:05,690 --> 01:37:07,880
but I don't know what he's saying.
You know what I heard?

2031
01:37:07,881 --> 01:37:12,881
I heard he's racist.
I'm hearing people were upset about the 

2032
01:37:12,881 --> 01:37:15,320
same thing with Dave Grohl.
He did that,

2033
01:37:15,321 --> 01:37:16,760
um,
sonic highways,

2034
01:37:17,990 --> 01:37:22,990
hbo series where he went to,
like cities that he found that that 

2035
01:37:24,081 --> 01:37:29,081
influenced him in some way would go and 
like find some like acts that were from 

2036
01:37:29,081 --> 01:37:30,680
there and then like,
you know,

2037
01:37:31,040 --> 01:37:34,520
a studio that he had been to or worked 
at coming up.

2038
01:37:34,690 --> 01:37:35,850
And it was,
it was really great.

2039
01:37:35,880 --> 01:37:37,470
He went to all these different cities,
you know,

2040
01:37:38,330 --> 01:37:43,330
DC and Seattle,
New York and all these cities along the 

2041
01:37:43,330 --> 01:37:44,270
way at every episode was focused on 
Wednesday and then people were like,

2042
01:37:44,570 --> 01:37:47,200
how come you didn't have more women?
Uh,

2043
01:37:47,270 --> 01:37:47,980
or,
you know,

2044
01:37:48,050 --> 01:37:50,050
more diversity.
And he was like,

2045
01:37:50,060 --> 01:37:55,060
I just,
it was a show about what influenced me 

2046
01:37:55,060 --> 01:37:55,410
where you grew up around white male 
musicians.

2047
01:37:55,411 --> 01:37:56,340
That was his era.

2048
01:37:56,460 --> 01:37:57,230
That's,
that's.

2049
01:37:57,470 --> 01:37:59,580
And he did have women on there.

2050
01:38:00,980 --> 01:38:02,200
Not Enough.
Yeah.

2051
01:38:02,540 --> 01:38:04,220
Well,
I told you I've been getting a hard time

2052
01:38:04,221 --> 01:38:09,221
about not having enough black friends.
I'm going to have a boards next week 

2053
01:38:09,221 --> 01:38:13,540
show everybody about.
And they're not on the show on the 

2054
01:38:13,540 --> 01:38:13,540
podcast,

2055
01:38:13,640 --> 01:38:14,480
you know,
I find,

2056
01:38:14,481 --> 01:38:19,481
and I think it's upsetting to me.
Did you see that thing and Rola heat by 

2057
01:38:19,481 --> 01:38:22,050
the way,
take one email.

2058
01:38:23,170 --> 01:38:28,170
There was some interview I read online 
where he said that there's so much 

2059
01:38:28,170 --> 01:38:28,810
censorship now.
He's like,

2060
01:38:28,820 --> 01:38:31,580
the Huffington post has succeeded in 
silencing.

2061
01:38:31,581 --> 01:38:36,581
The comedians were also afraid of saying
anything because we're afraid of being 

2062
01:38:36,581 --> 01:38:38,270
called a homophobe or a racist or this 
or that.

2063
01:38:38,990 --> 01:38:41,150
And I think there's some validity to 
that.

2064
01:38:41,151 --> 01:38:44,090
Especially with like Caitlyn Jenner,
like on our show,

2065
01:38:44,091 --> 01:38:44,830
I said,
you know,

2066
01:38:44,840 --> 01:38:46,520
we're just talking shit,
you know,

2067
01:38:46,521 --> 01:38:49,510
we're not,
we're not a pc show and the,

2068
01:38:49,520 --> 01:38:52,370
the emails,
oh don't you dare and Blah Blah Blah.

2069
01:38:52,580 --> 01:38:54,470
How can you be so insensitive?
And it's like,

2070
01:38:54,590 --> 01:38:59,590
you know what?
Something can happen in the world and 

2071
01:38:59,590 --> 01:39:00,520
why can't I have fucked up feelings?
You know what I want?

2072
01:39:00,590 --> 01:39:04,180
Why do I have to be on board with the PC
agenda straightaway?

2073
01:39:04,210 --> 01:39:05,510
I,
I'm all for her.

2074
01:39:05,540 --> 01:39:07,910
Please don't get me wrong.
Mazal Tov.

2075
01:39:07,911 --> 01:39:10,970
Do what you want to do,
but how come you know what I mean?

2076
01:39:10,971 --> 01:39:12,470
Like we,
I think we should also have somebody for

2077
01:39:12,471 --> 01:39:17,471
people maybe of a different generation.
Do you think my dad gives a fuck about 

2078
01:39:17,471 --> 01:39:18,530
Caitlyn Jenner and is going to be a 
sympathetic.

2079
01:39:18,700 --> 01:39:20,530
I,
I have a theory about all this.

2080
01:39:20,800 --> 01:39:25,800
I have a theory about all this like 
ultra sensitivity and ultra progressive 

2081
01:39:25,800 --> 01:39:26,930
thinking and it's,
I,

2082
01:39:27,090 --> 01:39:32,090
I feel like all of this stuff is very 
good and it's even though it kind of is 

2083
01:39:32,501 --> 01:39:37,501
against what I do for living as someone 
who talks a lot of shit about 

2084
01:39:37,501 --> 01:39:41,190
controversial issues,
I think that what it is is blowback 

2085
01:39:41,190 --> 01:39:46,080
against racism or sexism or homophobia.
It's just gone so far the other way that

2086
01:39:48,461 --> 01:39:52,000
it's become preposterous and then it'll 
bounce out somewhere in the middle.

2087
01:39:52,800 --> 01:39:57,800
Like what?
I've been making fun of this whole 

2088
01:39:57,800 --> 01:39:59,800
Caitlin Jenner thing onstage and I don't
want to reveal how I do it,

2089
01:39:59,801 --> 01:40:03,070
but in the way that I do it,
like I get people cheering.

2090
01:40:03,530 --> 01:40:07,240
People have been cheering what I'm 
saying and it's not negative.

2091
01:40:07,300 --> 01:40:09,280
It's not anti transgender.
It's not like.

2092
01:40:09,570 --> 01:40:14,570
But I think we have to remember who the 
fuck this guy was and who he was living 

2093
01:40:14,570 --> 01:40:16,750
with and what he was doing for the last 
20 fucking years.

2094
01:40:16,800 --> 01:40:17,260
Yeah.
Like,

2095
01:40:17,290 --> 01:40:18,700
stop,
stop with a.

2096
01:40:18,850 --> 01:40:21,220
It doesn't matter if you are secretly a 
woman.

2097
01:40:21,250 --> 01:40:25,660
What kind of a woman were you?
A dumb cunt I secretly had dumped.

2098
01:40:25,870 --> 01:40:28,270
Right?
Because that's what I'm hearing.

2099
01:40:28,640 --> 01:40:29,940
This is.
This is what you're doing.

2100
01:40:30,250 --> 01:40:34,240
You're still the same nonsense.
Talking materialistic.

2101
01:40:35,410 --> 01:40:37,780
Now you're changing your gender maniacs.
Yes,

2102
01:40:37,930 --> 01:40:40,900
because just simply by changing your 
gender,

2103
01:40:41,290 --> 01:40:45,100
I want it so that it's irrelevant so 
that you change your gender.

2104
01:40:45,101 --> 01:40:47,720
Have left or right back and forth.
Go Mail,

2105
01:40:47,730 --> 01:40:49,030
go female,
go back and forth.

2106
01:40:49,300 --> 01:40:52,930
What is the quality of what?
What are your thoughts?

2107
01:40:53,020 --> 01:40:58,020
Who are you when you express yourself?
Because what I get out of you is 

2108
01:40:58,020 --> 01:41:01,510
nonsense.
Not a single interesting thing all about

2109
01:41:01,511 --> 01:41:02,020
me,
me,

2110
01:41:02,021 --> 01:41:02,470
me,
me,

2111
01:41:02,471 --> 01:41:03,760
me.
I've always been a woman.

2112
01:41:03,761 --> 01:41:04,690
I'm in this.
I'm a dad,

2113
01:41:04,780 --> 01:41:05,610
I'm a Mama,
Mama,

2114
01:41:05,620 --> 01:41:06,240
Ma a me,
me,

2115
01:41:06,241 --> 01:41:06,610
me,
me,

2116
01:41:06,611 --> 01:41:06,910
me.

2117
01:41:07,120 --> 01:41:09,200
It's you want fucking attention.
Yeah,

2118
01:41:09,220 --> 01:41:11,620
and this is one of the best ways to get 
attention.

2119
01:41:11,680 --> 01:41:14,170
How about the fact that he goes from 
being on that show?

2120
01:41:14,171 --> 01:41:16,960
I want to be him.
I want to be referred to as a he.

2121
01:41:17,140 --> 01:41:22,140
I want people still call me bruce,
but the the 17 million people watching 

2122
01:41:22,140 --> 01:41:26,731
that show then immediately afterwards 
gets massive facial reconstructive 

2123
01:41:26,731 --> 01:41:28,270
surgery,
becomes a woman,

2124
01:41:28,390 --> 01:41:30,610
does this vanity fair thing and what is 
the.

2125
01:41:30,640 --> 01:41:35,640
What is the number one?
What is the number one thing that's 

2126
01:41:35,640 --> 01:41:35,640
happening?
Attention,

2127
01:41:35,640 --> 01:41:40,380
attention.
That's the factor in all of this is a 

2128
01:41:40,380 --> 01:41:43,220
tension completely ignoring everyone.
Completely ignoring the fact this 

2129
01:41:43,391 --> 01:41:47,230
fucking dummy killed somebody by not 
paying attention in his car,

2130
01:41:47,320 --> 01:41:51,490
slammed into a woman,
a real woman pushed her into traffic.

2131
01:41:51,760 --> 01:41:56,760
She got head on,
collided with a fucking Hummer of all 

2132
01:41:56,760 --> 01:42:00,001
cars.
You get a hit with a God damn fake 

2133
01:42:00,001 --> 01:42:00,001
military vehicle,
right?

2134
01:42:00,001 --> 01:42:01,420
I mean,
and everyone is just sort of pushed that

2135
01:42:01,421 --> 01:42:06,421
aside.
What's important is we recognize gender 

2136
01:42:06,421 --> 01:42:07,750
and gender is a social construct.
It's a dummy.

2137
01:42:07,770 --> 01:42:09,790
It's a dummy dummy,
dummy.

2138
01:42:09,791 --> 01:42:12,010
Whether it's a male dummy or a female 
dummy.

2139
01:42:12,060 --> 01:42:17,060
It's a dummy that doesn't pay attention 
and slams into your car from behind and 

2140
01:42:17,060 --> 01:42:18,420
pushes you into fucking traffic that no 
one's talking about.

2141
01:42:18,460 --> 01:42:21,400
No one's talking about that and that 
happened like a month before.

2142
01:42:21,430 --> 01:42:26,430
There's all it is.
All we're hearing is the woes of being 

2143
01:42:26,430 --> 01:42:29,320
transgender and absolutely I get that,
but like you know,

2144
01:42:29,321 --> 01:42:30,220
Bailey,
Jay is,

2145
01:42:31,270 --> 01:42:36,010
she's transgender and looks like as 
close to a woman as you're ever going to

2146
01:42:36,011 --> 01:42:36,460
get.
I mean,

2147
01:42:36,860 --> 01:42:38,840
God damn it mean if you don't want to 
believe.

2148
01:42:39,010 --> 01:42:40,870
If you look at someone like her and you 
don't say,

2149
01:42:40,871 --> 01:42:43,090
well,
that probably is someone who was born in

2150
01:42:43,091 --> 01:42:43,990
the wrong sex.

2151
01:42:44,110 --> 01:42:44,730
Look,
look at her.

2152
01:42:44,930 --> 01:42:46,150
Look at her.
She's gorgeous.

2153
01:42:46,151 --> 01:42:47,170
Beautiful.
Yeah.

2154
01:42:47,171 --> 01:42:49,760
She tricked the Shit Outta you thompson.
Right?

2155
01:42:50,160 --> 01:42:55,160
Like,
look at that one on the far right with 

2156
01:42:55,160 --> 01:42:55,160
her in the Black Bra.
Like,

2157
01:42:55,160 --> 01:42:55,160
cheat.
Come on.

2158
01:42:55,160 --> 01:42:55,160
Yeah,
come on.

2159
01:42:55,160 --> 01:42:56,350
Get the fuck out of dodge.
That's a God damn woman,

2160
01:42:56,351 --> 01:42:56,730
right?
Yeah.

2161
01:42:57,020 --> 01:42:59,350
Alright.
But she's interesting.

2162
01:42:59,600 --> 01:43:01,960
She was on Opie and Anthony and she was 
talking about,

2163
01:43:02,180 --> 01:43:07,180
you know,
being born transgender and all the 

2164
01:43:07,180 --> 01:43:08,851
different.
You're dealing with like a different 

2165
01:43:08,851 --> 01:43:10,441
quality of thinking,
a different quality of human beings who 

2166
01:43:10,441 --> 01:43:13,010
just also happens to be transgender.
Like I had a um,

2167
01:43:13,480 --> 01:43:17,020
buck angel.
He was great.

2168
01:43:17,080 --> 01:43:18,040
It was great.
Again,

2169
01:43:18,100 --> 01:43:23,100
a guy who was born,
a woman who really didn't feel like 

2170
01:43:23,100 --> 01:43:27,480
taking risks.
I mean that guy does pornography and is 

2171
01:43:27,480 --> 01:43:30,841
really out there talking about heroic 
terms of glass without having balls.

2172
01:43:33,370 --> 01:43:34,810
I mean for real,
but,

2173
01:43:34,840 --> 01:43:37,090
but again,
it's the quality of the human being.

2174
01:43:37,210 --> 01:43:38,790
It's like what?
What do you do?

2175
01:43:39,040 --> 01:43:44,040
What's going on inside your head as 
opposed to this nonsense existence that 

2176
01:43:44,040 --> 01:43:45,040
you've carved out for yourself?
Well,

2177
01:43:45,041 --> 01:43:50,041
and also the Amman,
the automatic applause show business 

2178
01:43:50,041 --> 01:43:51,180
hero hero.
Well,

2179
01:43:51,450 --> 01:43:52,010
I don't like to

2180
01:43:52,480 --> 01:43:54,650
put that on her fucking instagram.
I still haven't seen her yet.

2181
01:43:54,651 --> 01:43:59,651
I got to grab her and throttle or here 
got a picture of Bruce Jenner into hero 

2182
01:44:00,000 --> 01:44:01,280
mode.
Get out of here.

2183
01:44:01,281 --> 01:44:06,281
There was also,
they were celebrating online that like 

2184
01:44:06,281 --> 01:44:08,540
Seth Meyers,
he makes me mad personally that,

2185
01:44:08,541 --> 01:44:10,370
um,
that after that was like,

2186
01:44:10,371 --> 01:44:15,371
you know,
I know this was like on his show was 

2187
01:44:15,371 --> 01:44:15,410
like,
I don't have any joke about that and I'm

2188
01:44:15,411 --> 01:44:17,240
just glad we can live.
I'm just happy.

2189
01:44:17,241 --> 01:44:20,420
Like we're living somewhere where we 
don't have to make a joke about that.

2190
01:44:20,490 --> 01:44:25,490
Like people jokes may want to be pc.
It's like,

2191
01:44:27,600 --> 01:44:30,800
well that's so embarrassing,
sort of language like a really like what

2192
01:44:30,801 --> 01:44:34,100
you've done with your brand.
It's like that same sort of fake.

2193
01:44:34,430 --> 01:44:36,740
It's fake.
It's a fake opinion.

2194
01:44:37,050 --> 01:44:42,050
You don't think it's weird.
You don't think it's weird that it's 65 

2195
01:44:42,050 --> 01:44:42,050
years old.

2196
01:44:42,050 --> 01:44:43,740
You started to get a boob job and 
nothing looked.

2197
01:44:43,741 --> 01:44:48,741
This weird thing of substance has come 
out of that stupid clan and the other 

2198
01:44:49,311 --> 01:44:54,311
thing is I feel like now the blowback is
that people will criticize you and be 

2199
01:44:55,701 --> 01:45:00,701
really mean about it if you don't react 
the way they want you to react to any 

2200
01:45:02,690 --> 01:45:04,430
news that comes forth.
In other words,

2201
01:45:04,460 --> 01:45:09,460
this is what happened,
so now the lynching has done to the 

2202
01:45:09,460 --> 01:45:10,450
person who goes like,
I don't give a shit or,

2203
01:45:10,660 --> 01:45:12,500
or that's fucking weird.
Why is that?

2204
01:45:12,850 --> 01:45:14,870
So now you're not allowed to react to 
it,

2205
01:45:16,740 --> 01:45:17,540
right?
You can't.

2206
01:45:17,750 --> 01:45:22,040
You can't be confused about it or 
curious or maybe I'm scared.

2207
01:45:22,041 --> 01:45:27,041
Maybe this is a new thing about the fact
that it's terrifying to see a 

2208
01:45:27,041 --> 01:45:30,761
transgender.
Like I used to live on Man's field 

2209
01:45:30,761 --> 01:45:32,520
between fountain in Santa Monica,
it's Mecca,

2210
01:45:32,780 --> 01:45:34,040
Mecca,
Mecca.

2211
01:45:34,040 --> 01:45:36,420
For Travis and we would.
I'm sorry.

2212
01:45:36,430 --> 01:45:38,070
Oh my God.
Let me tell you something.

2213
01:45:38,810 --> 01:45:41,090
When you're walking up to your apartment
at 1:30

2214
01:45:41,091 --> 01:45:46,091
in the morning and three trans gender 
prostitutes,

2215
01:45:46,401 --> 01:45:48,100
transvestites,
bisexual,

2216
01:45:48,200 --> 01:45:51,470
whatever they are are walking up to you.
You Shit your pants.

2217
01:45:51,530 --> 01:45:56,530
Okay.
It's fucking scary to see a dude or a 

2218
01:45:56,530 --> 01:45:56,710
woman.
Six,

2219
01:45:56,730 --> 01:46:01,730
three yoked shoulders and arms.
And you see like a dude's face with 

2220
01:46:01,730 --> 01:46:02,240
hair.
I fucking Shit my pants.

2221
01:46:02,241 --> 01:46:04,330
I mean it was,
we wouldn't be scared but.

2222
01:46:04,340 --> 01:46:06,020
So are my roommates.
Like we would walk up.

2223
01:46:06,021 --> 01:46:11,021
What type of the Holy Shit scared when 
you saw it doesn't mean that you 

2224
01:46:11,021 --> 01:46:12,210
advocate want that guy.
Right?

2225
01:46:12,310 --> 01:46:17,310
And I'm not like,
I don't want that guy to know where the 

2226
01:46:17,310 --> 01:46:19,190
woman did not live their life and then.
But like why or how about like the idea 

2227
01:46:19,190 --> 01:46:19,820
that like,
hey,

2228
01:46:19,821 --> 01:46:21,200
this is what's going on with Caitlyn 
Jenner.

2229
01:46:21,380 --> 01:46:23,990
I don't give a shit.
Why do I have to keep my shit?

2230
01:46:24,170 --> 01:46:28,880
There's a lot of memories because I 
don't care if you're a man or a woman.

2231
01:46:28,910 --> 01:46:33,910
I don't really care if you didn't do I 
judge you based on who you are as a 

2232
01:46:33,910 --> 01:46:34,610
human being and this bouncing back and 
forth.

2233
01:46:34,640 --> 01:46:36,530
You could do it all you want.
I don't give a fuck.

2234
01:46:36,560 --> 01:46:41,560
Go and good for you.
Is there something else there besides 

2235
01:46:41,560 --> 01:46:41,560
your gender,
right?

2236
01:46:41,560 --> 01:46:41,560
Yes.
There's something else.

2237
01:46:41,560 --> 01:46:46,540
Do you have something to say?
Is there anything coming out of your 

2238
01:46:46,540 --> 01:46:46,540
mouth?
What was winning the Olympics like?

2239
01:46:47,390 --> 01:46:49,160
Yeah,
that's fucking crazy.

2240
01:46:49,260 --> 01:46:50,070
You're the greatest athlete

2241
01:46:50,070 --> 01:46:51,990
in the world.
At one point in time.

2242
01:46:52,340 --> 01:46:57,340
It was one of the baddest motherfuckers 
ever to do some shit that nobody does 

2243
01:46:57,340 --> 01:47:01,700
really gets me,
gets my asshole twisted is when they do 

2244
01:47:01,700 --> 01:47:03,640
come back to the Canadians.
Uh,

2245
01:47:04,040 --> 01:47:05,970
and you know,
listen,

2246
01:47:05,971 --> 01:47:10,971
when,
when in the history of ever has a comic 

2247
01:47:10,971 --> 01:47:12,540
advocated hate speech or violence 
towards.

2248
01:47:12,550 --> 01:47:14,830
I don't know that they fake that.
I mean,

2249
01:47:14,831 --> 01:47:19,831
there was,
there was a debate that Jim Norton got 

2250
01:47:19,831 --> 01:47:22,581
in with this woman was talking about 
rape jokes and comics qb on stage 

2251
01:47:22,581 --> 01:47:23,160
talking about rape and everyone's 
cheering.

2252
01:47:23,161 --> 01:47:23,640
I'm like,
look,

2253
01:47:23,760 --> 01:47:25,290
stop.
No one is.

2254
01:47:25,530 --> 01:47:27,120
No one does that.
That's not true.

2255
01:47:27,510 --> 01:47:30,240
The only time a joke like you're talking
about like bad comedy,

2256
01:47:30,241 --> 01:47:35,241
maybe some would say a bad rape joke.
The only time someone tells a joke and 

2257
01:47:35,241 --> 01:47:37,560
the word rape is involved as if it's 
funny.

2258
01:47:37,561 --> 01:47:42,561
If rape is involved,
like the idea that rape could never be 

2259
01:47:42,561 --> 01:47:42,561
funny.

2260
01:47:42,561 --> 01:47:43,460
You know?
I mean it's not true.

2261
01:47:44,160 --> 01:47:49,160
Things that unfortunately are funny.
This conversation we'll definitely get 

2262
01:47:49,201 --> 01:47:54,201
misinterpreted because good he perfect 
people because people don't listen like 

2263
01:47:54,871 --> 01:47:55,530
exactly.
They,

2264
01:47:55,620 --> 01:47:57,630
they'll,
they'll hear what they want to hear.

2265
01:47:57,810 --> 01:48:02,810
They won't hear the fact that like 
nobody here is unaccepting or uncaring 

2266
01:48:02,810 --> 01:48:06,600
or advocating that somebody doesn't have
a right to anything or hatred.

2267
01:48:06,870 --> 01:48:11,870
They're just gonna hear what they want 
to hear in that and not allow you to 

2268
01:48:11,870 --> 01:48:11,880
have a different opinion on it.
Exactly.

2269
01:48:12,270 --> 01:48:13,680
And I think.
But like I said,

2270
01:48:13,681 --> 01:48:17,340
I think that all of this is good and 
even this extreme pc,

2271
01:48:17,370 --> 01:48:22,370
because it's better than the opposite,
the opposite is like being a fucking 

2272
01:48:22,370 --> 01:48:25,461
Nazi.
The opposite is like killing people 

2273
01:48:25,461 --> 01:48:25,461
because they're Jews.
The opposite is,

2274
01:48:25,461 --> 01:48:29,550
is,
is instead of being super sensitive is 

2275
01:48:29,550 --> 01:48:32,961
being completely insensitive.
So I think ultimately like it's just 

2276
01:48:32,961 --> 01:48:34,440
swinging one way and I think what we're 
dealing with also,

2277
01:48:34,441 --> 01:48:36,290
and this is the weird aspect of it,
we all,

2278
01:48:36,350 --> 01:48:37,080
we all agree on this.

2279
01:48:37,470 --> 01:48:42,470
There's a bunch of people that if you 
don't think the way they think they're 

2280
01:48:42,470 --> 01:48:43,700
fucking super mean to you,
that yeah.

2281
01:48:43,740 --> 01:48:48,740
So those are like people that are 
supposed to be progressive and kind and 

2282
01:48:48,740 --> 01:48:49,530
sensitive and less that you disagree 
with them.

2283
01:48:49,540 --> 01:48:54,540
Then they're,
then they're nasty and you see it in 

2284
01:48:54,540 --> 01:48:54,540
comedy.
A lot of times among comedians were like

2285
01:48:54,540 --> 01:48:58,750
the most progressive thinkers and ended 
up being like super bowl sometimes.

2286
01:48:58,800 --> 01:49:01,630
There's not really progressive thinkers.
They were.

2287
01:49:01,660 --> 01:49:04,190
They're trying to do as they're mining 
the world,

2288
01:49:04,230 --> 01:49:09,230
the world of ideas for love and 
acceptance and the moral high ground 

2289
01:49:09,230 --> 01:49:13,800
they're trying to find instead of like 
having this like nuanced objective point

2290
01:49:13,801 --> 01:49:14,940
of view where they look at,
okay,

2291
01:49:14,941 --> 01:49:19,941
let's imagine what it would be like to 
be someone who wishes you were a woman.

2292
01:49:20,101 --> 01:49:21,300
When you're a man.
I,

2293
01:49:21,480 --> 01:49:25,980
I can totally see that conversation 
being a fascinating conversation,

2294
01:49:26,190 --> 01:49:29,760
but if you immediately say to me like,
no,

2295
01:49:29,761 --> 01:49:33,060
you have to call him a her now.
No,

2296
01:49:33,090 --> 01:49:35,310
you have to refer to him as his new 
name.

2297
01:49:35,520 --> 01:49:36,840
No,
you have to do this.

2298
01:49:36,841 --> 01:49:37,440
No,
you have the.

2299
01:49:37,680 --> 01:49:40,230
What about debate?
What about discussion?

2300
01:49:40,260 --> 01:49:42,450
This is off discussion.
This is off the table.

2301
01:49:42,540 --> 01:49:44,550
Anything that's off the table is 
bullshit.

2302
01:49:44,970 --> 01:49:46,720
You can't make fun of his bullshit.
Yeah,

2303
01:49:46,800 --> 01:49:47,980
that's true.
And I would argue

2304
01:49:47,980 --> 01:49:52,980
even it's more dehumanizing to not tell 
jokes about Caitlyn Jenner because you 

2305
01:49:53,031 --> 01:49:54,600
are in effect saying,
uh,

2306
01:49:54,601 --> 01:49:58,300
I pity this creature so much.
I can't make fun of her.

2307
01:49:58,480 --> 01:50:01,540
She can't handle it.
You're actually dehumanizing.

2308
01:50:01,560 --> 01:50:06,560
Seeing somebody.
What's starting to be super sensitive 

2309
01:50:06,560 --> 01:50:07,440
customer visits.
It's time to embrace the new norm.

2310
01:50:07,620 --> 01:50:11,070
The new norm is we're not going to eat 
meat and we're not going to lift weights

2311
01:50:11,100 --> 01:50:14,040
and we're not going to be aggressive and
Kumbaya

2312
01:50:14,440 --> 01:50:16,390
bullying too.
We've solved that problem.

2313
01:50:16,420 --> 01:50:18,790
Right?
If we just keep talking about it because

2314
01:50:18,791 --> 01:50:23,791
my friend teaches in New York and she 
said they give the kids the riot act on 

2315
01:50:23,830 --> 01:50:27,080
bullying and school and then micro 
aggressions.

2316
01:50:27,520 --> 01:50:28,640
Hilarious.
Yeah.

2317
01:50:28,900 --> 01:50:33,900
But then they get online,
passive aggressive and then they go 

2318
01:50:33,900 --> 01:50:34,370
online and they cyberbully this shit out
of each.

2319
01:50:35,000 --> 01:50:37,020
It has to come out somewhere.

2320
01:50:37,300 --> 01:50:38,230
Come out somewhere.
Well,

2321
01:50:38,231 --> 01:50:43,231
not only that,
bullying is negative and horrible as it 

2322
01:50:43,231 --> 01:50:46,261
is,
as caused a lot of people to develop an 

2323
01:50:46,261 --> 01:50:48,940
idea of themselves that's rock solid.
Like,

2324
01:50:48,941 --> 01:50:49,900
you know,
fuck you.

2325
01:50:49,901 --> 01:50:51,640
I know what I like,
fuck you.

2326
01:50:51,790 --> 01:50:56,790
And then they go on and they do their 
own thing and then they become 

2327
01:50:56,790 --> 01:50:56,790
successful.
Sure.

2328
01:50:56,790 --> 01:50:57,800
By doing that it becomes motivation for 
sure.

2329
01:50:57,960 --> 01:51:02,960
You know,
like Chris Rock has a bit about Bill 

2330
01:51:02,960 --> 01:51:02,960
Gates and that if you don't have 
bullies,

2331
01:51:02,960 --> 01:51:04,170
you don't get guys like Bill Gates,
you know,

2332
01:51:04,240 --> 01:51:07,420
because those guys get bullied and they 
run off and start giant businesses.

2333
01:51:08,520 --> 01:51:12,340
There's some validity to that.
Like I was bullied when I was young.

2334
01:51:12,880 --> 01:51:17,880
It made me do.
It made me fucking learn how to kick 

2335
01:51:17,880 --> 01:51:17,880
people's asses like this.
Yeah.

2336
01:51:17,880 --> 01:51:18,670
Both things.
Yeah,

2337
01:51:18,700 --> 01:51:23,700
yeah,
but it made me go into martial arts is 

2338
01:51:23,700 --> 01:51:23,700
like,
I don't want anybody to beat me up.

2339
01:51:23,700 --> 01:51:24,040
I'm scared.
I'm scared all the time,

2340
01:51:24,250 --> 01:51:25,720
so what do I need to do?
Well,

2341
01:51:25,721 --> 01:51:27,160
if I didn't do that,
I would have never went.

2342
01:51:27,161 --> 01:51:32,161
If someone didn't fuck with me,
I would've never went into my bullying 

2343
01:51:32,161 --> 01:51:35,431
was very mild.
It was mostly like fear and 

2344
01:51:35,431 --> 01:51:37,321
intimidation.
That was anybody actually physically 

2345
01:51:37,321 --> 01:51:39,721
hurting me,
but it made me go into martial arts and 

2346
01:51:39,721 --> 01:51:40,860
if I didn't do that,
who the fuck knows what kind of a person

2347
01:51:40,861 --> 01:51:43,870
I would have been if I didn't go through
those challenges and the all the,

2348
01:51:43,871 --> 01:51:45,880
the,
the difficulties of martial arts.

2349
01:51:46,030 --> 01:51:47,920
I would never be the same person I am 
now.

2350
01:51:47,940 --> 01:51:49,450
Fear is a great motivator,
dude.

2351
01:51:49,451 --> 01:51:51,910
I,
I remember anxiety of the best.

2352
01:51:52,270 --> 01:51:57,270
They bused in a bunch of kids in my 
school from bad neighborhoods and I'm 

2353
01:51:57,330 --> 01:52:02,330
fucking scared of all of them and people
getting beat up and fucking terrified 

2354
01:52:02,330 --> 01:52:07,201
and this one kid got me a headlock and 
threw me on the ground and the locker 

2355
01:52:07,201 --> 01:52:07,201
room and I was like 14.

2356
01:52:07,201 --> 01:52:08,050
I was like,
I couldn't do anything to them.

2357
01:52:08,500 --> 01:52:10,150
It was just so much stronger than me and
I was like,

2358
01:52:10,151 --> 01:52:12,040
fuck,
I got to learn how to fight,

2359
01:52:12,430 --> 01:52:14,950
and I remember thinking that like God 
damn it,

2360
01:52:15,030 --> 01:52:17,050
like Jesus Christ.
I'm terrified all the time.

2361
01:52:17,230 --> 01:52:18,710
Like where is that guy over there?
Oh,

2362
01:52:18,711 --> 01:52:20,740
I've got to go around.
You know that feeling,

2363
01:52:21,550 --> 01:52:26,550
but that's doesn't new schools all the 
time and that fear was really prevalent 

2364
01:52:26,550 --> 01:52:29,620
for a lot of years.
Go back now and look at those.

2365
01:52:29,950 --> 01:52:32,470
Those are like formative moments,
hundred percent.

2366
01:52:32,500 --> 01:52:37,500
You understand human interaction and 
psychology and a very deep way because 

2367
01:52:37,500 --> 01:52:41,650
you understand the worst aspects of it.
It's not good that those aspects exists,

2368
01:52:41,830 --> 01:52:44,740
but those aspects exists in nature.
They exist in.

2369
01:52:44,830 --> 01:52:48,260
I have chickens and the the term pecking
order.

2370
01:52:48,440 --> 01:52:53,440
The reason why that that term exists 
because they fucking pack out each 

2371
01:52:53,440 --> 01:52:53,440
other.

2372
01:52:53,440 --> 01:52:57,080
They find out who's the baddest chicken.
They and by the way it goes,

2373
01:52:57,140 --> 01:53:01,820
it changes like the pecking order 
changes like chickens become brooders,

2374
01:53:02,030 --> 01:53:03,770
which means like when they,
they,

2375
01:53:03,800 --> 01:53:06,080
for some reason they decide that this 
egg,

2376
01:53:06,081 --> 01:53:08,480
even though there's no rooster,
they had a bunch of lesbians,

2377
01:53:08,630 --> 01:53:12,410
they decided that this egg is going to 
become a bird,

2378
01:53:12,620 --> 01:53:17,620
so they sit on the egg and then they get
crazy and they pull their feathers off 

2379
01:53:17,620 --> 01:53:21,191
and it's like a long cycle for them to 
figure out this egg is never going to 

2380
01:53:21,191 --> 01:53:25,211
become.
It's kind of sad that this egg is never 

2381
01:53:25,211 --> 01:53:27,341
actually going to become a chicken.
They're little tiny reptile brains just 

2382
01:53:27,341 --> 01:53:30,761
don't get it.
So you have to take them out of there 

2383
01:53:30,761 --> 01:53:30,761
brooding stage and what you do is you 
put them,

2384
01:53:30,761 --> 01:53:35,591
you isolate them in a small cage for a 
couple of days and you put them where 

2385
01:53:35,591 --> 01:53:37,520
they have to rest on the pole.

2386
01:53:37,670 --> 01:53:39,500
They have to stand on the pole,
which is how they sleep anyway.

2387
01:53:40,020 --> 01:53:42,440
The rest on like a little bar or 
something like that.

2388
01:53:43,040 --> 01:53:44,700
That's just their words,
you know.

2389
01:53:44,720 --> 01:53:49,720
But anyway,
when you take them out and you 

2390
01:53:49,720 --> 01:53:52,361
reintroduce them to the population,
all the other chickens stopped fucking 

2391
01:53:52,361 --> 01:53:55,001
with them and just what animals do.
That's how they motivate animals to not 

2392
01:53:55,881 --> 01:53:59,000
just be lazy fucks and sit around doing 
nothing.

2393
01:53:59,100 --> 01:54:00,920
I mean it's.
It's unfortunate.

2394
01:54:00,950 --> 01:54:02,330
It feels weird.
It's sad,

2395
01:54:02,600 --> 01:54:07,600
but it's because why is it because 
because chickens have and become 

2396
01:54:07,600 --> 01:54:07,850
dolphins yet it's because chickens 
haven't become aliens.

2397
01:54:07,851 --> 01:54:12,851
They haven't evolved to the point where 
they can read minds and fly through 

2398
01:54:12,851 --> 01:54:12,851
space.
They're just chicken,

2399
01:54:12,851 --> 01:54:14,900
this chicken fucking chickens and when 
the other chicken gets out of the box,

2400
01:54:14,901 --> 01:54:18,500
you pick that fucker.
Just that's what happens.

2401
01:54:18,570 --> 01:54:23,570
We were watching the thing on gorillas 
and how that order so sophisticated.

2402
01:54:24,100 --> 01:54:29,100
It's so sophisticated and different from
our society and there's a definite like 

2403
01:54:29,100 --> 01:54:33,521
there's a top dog and there's major like
stepping up and finding out that you're 

2404
01:54:33,521 --> 01:54:36,670
not and then those guys do not fuck with
that guy for awhile.

2405
01:54:37,150 --> 01:54:39,680
Yeah.
Primate psychology.

2406
01:54:39,681 --> 01:54:44,681
It's very applicable to human beings and
a lot of ways obviously we'd like to 

2407
01:54:44,681 --> 01:54:48,731
transcend that and I think the 
motivation and transcend that is the 

2408
01:54:48,731 --> 01:54:50,240
same motivation that leads people to,
you know,

2409
01:54:50,241 --> 01:54:55,241
to be more accepting and to be more open
minded when it comes to things like 

2410
01:54:55,460 --> 01:54:59,750
racism or things like transgender rights
or gay rights or any of those things.

2411
01:54:59,930 --> 01:55:01,850
So ultimately I think these were all 
good.

2412
01:55:02,060 --> 01:55:05,570
It's all good,
but there's a lot of fakers out there.

2413
01:55:05,720 --> 01:55:10,720
There's a lot of like fake progressive 
thinkers and fake sweet people that 

2414
01:55:11,061 --> 01:55:16,061
really what they're doing is just 
looking for an opportunity to be a cunt 

2415
01:55:16,061 --> 01:55:17,930
and when they see that you're not going 
along with the PC mindset,

2416
01:55:18,110 --> 01:55:21,140
there are super aggressive towards you 
and when you see them,

2417
01:55:21,141 --> 01:55:26,141
a lot of times they have fucking dyed 
blue hair and they're old morbidly obese

2418
01:55:26,301 --> 01:55:27,560
and they're all fucked up.
It's like,

2419
01:55:27,561 --> 01:55:28,640
okay,
you're.

2420
01:55:28,641 --> 01:55:33,641
You're getting angry about something to 
take away from the fact that you're 

2421
01:55:33,641 --> 01:55:37,400
neglecting your very physical body.
You're neglecting your life.

2422
01:55:37,401 --> 01:55:42,401
You are.
You're wallowing in some sort of 

2423
01:55:42,401 --> 01:55:42,780
depression and all of your success.
Like what?

2424
01:55:42,781 --> 01:55:44,120
What is it based on?
What will your,

2425
01:55:44,120 --> 01:55:45,060
your,
your success,

2426
01:55:45,270 --> 01:55:47,310
your focus,
you'll go to their twitter page.

2427
01:55:47,430 --> 01:55:51,480
It's all like shitting on people who are
not progressive thinking.

2428
01:55:51,600 --> 01:55:55,050
Exactly.
They love to low frequencies.

2429
01:55:55,051 --> 01:55:57,960
There's people to that.
Their whole charge,

2430
01:55:58,020 --> 01:56:03,020
their emotional charge that they get is 
in being the a is in getting with that 

2431
01:56:03,301 --> 01:56:07,800
group to yell at the person like what 
did you say about that?

2432
01:56:07,860 --> 01:56:11,200
And then they love to write the blog or 
the tweet or you know,

2433
01:56:11,210 --> 01:56:12,720
whatever.
Comment on a video.

2434
01:56:12,750 --> 01:56:16,170
Yes.
That there was this great tweet,

2435
01:56:16,171 --> 01:56:18,690
Neal Brennan did remember,
like a month ago,

2436
01:56:18,720 --> 01:56:23,720
he goes,
imagine how much funnier Richard prior 

2437
01:56:23,720 --> 01:56:26,400
had been if he had think pieces and 
blogs to guide to guide him.

2438
01:56:26,430 --> 01:56:27,280
Yeah,
that's,

2439
01:56:28,690 --> 01:56:32,600
that's great pieces.
What does it even mean?

2440
01:56:32,640 --> 01:56:37,640
Fuck you masturbatory think and hide 
behind the computer to go,

2441
01:56:38,161 --> 01:56:40,050
you know,
and if you really feel that,

2442
01:56:40,230 --> 01:56:42,810
stand up and say that in front of a live
audience,

2443
01:56:42,811 --> 01:56:45,990
why don't you get your fucking column if
you go to the UC and pull it off,

2444
01:56:46,590 --> 01:56:49,590
that's true.
The right spot.

2445
01:56:50,220 --> 01:56:55,220
Those poor folks that develop in those 
super alt rooms and then they actually 

2446
01:56:55,220 --> 01:56:55,800
try to go out to a real room somewhere 
on the road.

2447
01:56:55,801 --> 01:56:57,910
I'm trying to make money and people 
looking.

2448
01:56:58,140 --> 01:56:59,460
People in Minnesota go,
wait,

2449
01:56:59,461 --> 01:57:01,770
what the fuck are you joking around 
about?

2450
01:57:02,240 --> 01:57:07,240
Yeah,
you can be real safe and your 

2451
01:57:07,240 --> 01:57:07,590
development and it's not too good for 
you sanctimonious fuckheads.

2452
01:57:07,650 --> 01:57:09,510
There's just so much of that going on.
Either way.

2453
01:57:09,511 --> 01:57:12,630
You mentioned little Jimmy Norton.
We're doing a show with him on Friday.

2454
01:57:14,930 --> 01:57:16,620
Where were you guys are?
Oh,

2455
01:57:17,320 --> 01:57:19,790
oh,
so you guys are teaming up while we were

2456
01:57:19,820 --> 01:57:21,770
part of.
They were doing a big festival.

2457
01:57:22,970 --> 01:57:25,030
The DV.
He like a.

2458
01:57:25,060 --> 01:57:27,040
it's a big radio station.
DV.

2459
01:57:27,060 --> 01:57:32,060
He wd v I think is what it is and it's a
Christina and I.

2460
01:57:32,550 --> 01:57:33,750
Michael Che,
Bill Crawford,

2461
01:57:33,751 --> 01:57:35,850
and Jimmy Norton.
Powerful.

2462
01:57:36,450 --> 01:57:37,620
Yeah,
that sounds good.

2463
01:57:37,900 --> 01:57:41,100
Shawn just fly in early or do radio with
them that morning.

2464
01:57:41,101 --> 01:57:41,550
Then we say,
well,

2465
01:57:41,551 --> 01:57:45,000
he's a fucking warrior battling against 
this pc mentality,

2466
01:57:45,001 --> 01:57:48,180
but he's also very open minded and super
pro tranny.

2467
01:57:48,340 --> 01:57:51,690
I got in a lot of ways,
but he loves them,

2468
01:57:51,710 --> 01:57:56,490
but I think that's worth noting in this 
discussion is that really I think all of

2469
01:57:56,491 --> 01:57:59,130
us are pro all of these things.
Yes.

2470
01:57:59,690 --> 01:58:04,690
One hundred percent still be pro.
These society evolving and have 

2471
01:58:04,690 --> 01:58:08,130
contradictory or whatever conflicting 
feelings are on it.

2472
01:58:08,310 --> 01:58:09,600
Just.
It's also like,

2473
01:58:09,660 --> 01:58:14,660
just because you don't like one man 
doesn't mean you hate all the men were 

2474
01:58:14,950 --> 01:58:19,950
just because you think one transgender 
person is a fucking dumb ass doesn't 

2475
01:58:19,950 --> 01:58:22,740
mean you hate all of them or your trans 
phobic.

2476
01:58:22,920 --> 01:58:25,140
Yeah.
Like all this nonsense talk,

2477
01:58:25,420 --> 01:58:27,280
you know,
I dealt with all this ridiculous piece.

2478
01:58:27,281 --> 01:58:30,750
You Shit when I was talking about that 
fighter that he is a man for 30 years,

2479
01:58:30,751 --> 01:58:32,850
became a woman for two years,
didn't disclose it,

2480
01:58:33,030 --> 01:58:38,030
was beating the shit out of these women 
and one of the conversations that I had 

2481
01:58:38,030 --> 01:58:38,030
online,
which was hilarious,

2482
01:58:38,190 --> 01:58:42,070
one of the conversations was so 
hilarious and this woman's

2483
01:58:42,120 --> 01:58:43,300
was,
was defending it,

2484
01:58:43,301 --> 01:58:46,360
this super progressive woman with 
fucking pink hair and a big fat face.

2485
01:58:46,690 --> 01:58:48,720
And she was like.
She was like,

2486
01:58:48,910 --> 01:58:53,910
she was always a man and I said even 
when she was always a woman rather,

2487
01:58:54,370 --> 01:58:59,370
and I said even when she was having sex 
with a woman and got her pregnant and 

2488
01:58:59,370 --> 01:59:02,320
had a kid and her response was even then
I was like,

2489
01:59:02,321 --> 01:59:03,010
okay,
we're done.

2490
01:59:03,290 --> 01:59:03,760
Yeah,
we're done.

2491
01:59:03,761 --> 01:59:04,240
We're done.
We're done.

2492
01:59:04,241 --> 01:59:09,241
We can't do this is your.
You're talking nonsense because you're 

2493
01:59:09,241 --> 01:59:12,211
focused on sex.
That's not what this is about and not 

2494
01:59:12,211 --> 01:59:14,851
only that,
you're talking about something in a way 

2495
01:59:14,851 --> 01:59:19,590
where you completely eliminate the 
possibility that you might be dealing 

2496
01:59:19,590 --> 01:59:20,940
with a crazy person like because because
it's dealing,

2497
01:59:20,960 --> 01:59:25,960
you're dealing with a progressive 
accepted thing where you have to put it 

2498
01:59:25,960 --> 01:59:29,731
in a box.
You can never even consider the very 

2499
01:59:29,731 --> 01:59:32,320
realistic possibility that you might be 
dealing with someone who is not mentally

2500
01:59:32,321 --> 01:59:32,710
sane.

2501
01:59:32,710 --> 01:59:33,220
Yeah.
Right.

2502
01:59:33,430 --> 01:59:38,430
Not Healthy and it whether or not 
they're transgender might be beside the 

2503
01:59:38,430 --> 01:59:38,910
point.
I mean,

2504
01:59:38,960 --> 01:59:42,730
you're talking about someone who 
pretended to be a natural born woman and

2505
01:59:42,731 --> 01:59:47,731
didn't disclose it,
didn't disclose something that might be 

2506
01:59:47,731 --> 01:59:47,731
pretty significant.
We talked about it,

2507
01:59:47,731 --> 01:59:50,890
that it was a medical issue.
It's not a medical issue,

2508
01:59:50,891 --> 01:59:53,320
medical issue that you have herpes,
that's a medical issue.

2509
01:59:54,350 --> 01:59:59,020
A gender issue is you have a man's bone 
structure and you want to fight women.

2510
01:59:59,160 --> 02:00:04,160
That's.
It's such a specific and unique case in 

2511
02:00:04,160 --> 02:00:07,240
this specific case where a man was like,
I was,

2512
02:00:07,290 --> 02:00:08,350
you know,
not a man.

2513
02:00:08,351 --> 02:00:09,820
I shouldn't.
I was born in the wrong body.

2514
02:00:10,100 --> 02:00:11,980
Comes a woman which has every right to 
do,

2515
02:00:12,190 --> 02:00:15,370
but then with that man's frame in your 
hands and stuff,

2516
02:00:15,520 --> 02:00:17,470
the fuck out of girls.
Yeah,

2517
02:00:17,500 --> 02:00:20,180
and brags about it and gloats and mean.
It was.

2518
02:00:20,410 --> 02:00:25,410
There was a lot of dark shit that was 
attached to that that people were 

2519
02:00:25,410 --> 02:00:28,600
conveniently ignoring because it didn't 
fit their pc agenda.

2520
02:00:28,790 --> 02:00:30,250
It didn't fit there.
This,

2521
02:00:30,251 --> 02:00:35,251
this,
this weird fucking like angle that they 

2522
02:00:35,251 --> 02:00:36,790
wanted to take.
Very specific angle.

2523
02:00:36,850 --> 02:00:38,350
Yeah.
I don't know.

2524
02:00:38,530 --> 02:00:39,880
It's fucking.
It's a bit.

2525
02:00:39,881 --> 02:00:42,730
It becomes one of those things where 
ultimately I think it's good.

2526
02:00:42,880 --> 02:00:47,880
I think that this,
the push towards pc is move towards pc.

2527
02:00:47,951 --> 02:00:48,900
To me it,
it,

2528
02:00:48,940 --> 02:00:53,940
it,
it signifies that people are becoming 

2529
02:00:53,940 --> 02:00:53,940
more sensitive

2530
02:00:53,940 --> 02:00:55,140
and I was thinking about this actually 
last week.

2531
02:00:56,790 --> 02:00:59,730
Do you think that,
I'm talking about the PC movement of the

2532
02:00:59,731 --> 02:01:02,160
nineties where we renamed everything and
everybody.

2533
02:01:02,161 --> 02:01:07,161
Carlin had a great bit about this.
They're not cripples their handicapable 

2534
02:01:08,370 --> 02:01:10,350
people aren't shell shocked.
They have.

2535
02:01:10,410 --> 02:01:14,250
Ptsd is a syndrome where we soften the 
language.

2536
02:01:14,251 --> 02:01:19,251
We changed the way we use language.
Do you think it really changed people's 

2537
02:01:19,251 --> 02:01:24,141
minds?
Meaning do you think guys like our dads 

2538
02:01:24,141 --> 02:01:25,170
age really changed the way they thought 
about,

2539
02:01:25,740 --> 02:01:27,060
for instance,
women,

2540
02:01:27,061 --> 02:01:32,061
if they can't call them bitches or 
broads or did it really changed how 

2541
02:01:32,061 --> 02:01:35,430
people thought that changed?
Probably the people that were coming up.

2542
02:01:35,431 --> 02:01:36,390
Right,
but not the guy.

2543
02:01:36,470 --> 02:01:37,950
Young people,
but I mean,

2544
02:01:37,951 --> 02:01:40,100
does it change the already

2545
02:01:40,130 --> 02:01:42,590
who grew up a certain way?
Probably not.

2546
02:01:42,591 --> 02:01:47,591
I think they look at it like the fuck 
are you talking about with that soft 

2547
02:01:47,591 --> 02:01:47,591
language shit.
I mean,

2548
02:01:47,591 --> 02:01:49,470
I know that like my dad's generation.
Yeah.

2549
02:01:50,180 --> 02:01:53,660
Your Dad's generation to people in power
still right there.

2550
02:01:53,661 --> 02:01:56,180
They look at that.
Ptsd is like,

2551
02:01:56,510 --> 02:01:57,510
you know,
no,

2552
02:01:57,640 --> 02:01:58,990
it's shell shock.
Yeah.

2553
02:01:59,050 --> 02:02:00,500
Yeah.
I don't know,

2554
02:02:00,501 --> 02:02:05,501
like PTSD,
probably no different between that and 

2555
02:02:05,501 --> 02:02:07,520
shell shocked in a lot of people's minds
because you're not,

2556
02:02:07,620 --> 02:02:12,620
you know,
not necessarily defining it in any 

2557
02:02:12,620 --> 02:02:15,550
different way,
but the word cripple a hard to hear if 

2558
02:02:15,550 --> 02:02:18,180
your kid has an issue right now,
if your kid's handicap.

2559
02:02:18,800 --> 02:02:21,560
It wasn't always that way.
That was just what we call them.

2560
02:02:21,950 --> 02:02:25,460
Roosevelt was doctors used to say cold 
called people morons.

2561
02:02:25,740 --> 02:02:30,740
Yeah.
Mongoloid idiots was what they would 

2562
02:02:30,740 --> 02:02:30,740
call people that were born with down 
syndrome.

2563
02:02:30,740 --> 02:02:35,740
They called the Mongoloid idiots when 
they would write that on the birth 

2564
02:02:35,740 --> 02:02:35,740
certificate.
Right.

2565
02:02:35,740 --> 02:02:36,560
But that's what you.
That's what you knew.

2566
02:02:36,561 --> 02:02:39,050
It was just a word for something that 
meant the same.

2567
02:02:39,051 --> 02:02:41,390
But do you think they reacted the same?
Like do you think they were like,

2568
02:02:41,720 --> 02:02:46,720
that's pretty harsh.
Like didn't know what we know now and 

2569
02:02:46,720 --> 02:02:51,191
it's like.
I think that's the idea about this move 

2570
02:02:51,191 --> 02:02:53,771
towards people being more sensitive.
That's what I like about the move 

2571
02:02:53,771 --> 02:02:57,161
towards people will be more sensitive 
because I think it's forcing people to 

2572
02:02:57,161 --> 02:02:58,250
maybe reconsider the way they think 
about things.

2573
02:02:58,950 --> 02:03:00,740
That's not a bad thing.
That's not a bad thing.

2574
02:03:00,750 --> 02:03:05,750
I think too soft and the language also 
takes the harshness of the thing like 

2575
02:03:05,750 --> 02:03:10,661
Carlin's point was,
if it's not shell shock is what it 

2576
02:03:10,661 --> 02:03:10,661
sounds like.
Shell shock,

2577
02:03:10,661 --> 02:03:11,720
the guy has been back from war.

2578
02:03:11,970 --> 02:03:16,700
The posttraumatic stress disorder takes 
the Zang,

2579
02:03:16,850 --> 02:03:21,850
the actual gravity and maybe if you 
called it something more aggressive 

2580
02:03:21,850 --> 02:03:23,810
because it is horrible to have this 
thing,

2581
02:03:24,170 --> 02:03:29,170
but we soften the labels of things and 
there for soften the meaning of things 

2582
02:03:29,170 --> 02:03:31,520
and take away like the gravity of 
posttraumatic stress disorder is a weird

2583
02:03:31,521 --> 02:03:33,140
one because that can apply to a lot of 
things.

2584
02:03:33,141 --> 02:03:37,370
People that are involved in murders,
like someone who was involved in violent

2585
02:03:37,371 --> 02:03:40,760
crimes when they were young.
That's stress cops.

2586
02:03:41,020 --> 02:03:46,020
I think cops are the forgotten victims 
of posttraumatic stress disorder and 

2587
02:03:46,020 --> 02:03:47,520
people talk about why all these cops 
shooting people.

2588
02:03:47,530 --> 02:03:49,370
Well,
try being a fucking cop.

2589
02:03:49,610 --> 02:03:54,610
Try being a cop for 10 years.
Every day you're showing up five days a 

2590
02:03:54,610 --> 02:03:57,971
week,
someone's lying to you and people 

2591
02:03:57,971 --> 02:03:59,260
shooting at you.
You're dealing with the most horrific 

2592
02:03:59,260 --> 02:04:01,691
violence and let's be honest,
most likely you got the job because you 

2593
02:04:01,691 --> 02:04:03,200
didn't have a whole lot of other 
options.

2594
02:04:03,480 --> 02:04:04,400
You know what I mean?
There's A.

2595
02:04:04,401 --> 02:04:07,610
There's a lot of people out there that 
are cops that are cops because they want

2596
02:04:07,611 --> 02:04:12,611
to help because it seemed like a good 
thing to do because it's something they 

2597
02:04:12,611 --> 02:04:13,220
always wanted to be a part of.
They always love law enforcement.

2598
02:04:13,221 --> 02:04:18,221
Maybe they came from the military.
Maybe they had a martial arts 

2599
02:04:18,221 --> 02:04:20,681
background.
They felt like it was a good fit for 

2600
02:04:20,681 --> 02:04:22,721
them,
but there's also a lot of people that 

2601
02:04:22,721 --> 02:04:24,251
are cops that are fucking morons and 
they're just like every other walk of 

2602
02:04:24,251 --> 02:04:26,981
life.
Like a lot of people that are ice cream 

2603
02:04:26,981 --> 02:04:26,981
man are fucking idiots,
you know,

2604
02:04:26,981 --> 02:04:27,780
and a lot of people with ice cream and 
they have great jokes and the kids loved

2605
02:04:27,810 --> 02:04:28,770
when they show up.
Yeah.

2606
02:04:28,880 --> 02:04:31,040
You know what I mean?
It's like you can't just.

2607
02:04:31,130 --> 02:04:34,430
Nobody gets a blanket pass through 
whether you're a transgender,

2608
02:04:34,431 --> 02:04:35,840
whether you're gay,
whether you're straight,

2609
02:04:35,841 --> 02:04:37,100
whether you're white,
whether you're black,

2610
02:04:37,260 --> 02:04:38,430
nobody gets a free ride.

2611
02:04:38,560 --> 02:04:41,000
You're you.
If you really are not racist,

2612
02:04:41,001 --> 02:04:42,750
who you really are not prejudiced in any
way,

2613
02:04:43,020 --> 02:04:48,020
judge people based on their individual 
merits and not just put them in a 

2614
02:04:48,020 --> 02:04:51,801
category and give them a fucking free 
pass because there is some form of 

2615
02:04:51,801 --> 02:04:56,130
minority,
whether it's a minority because they're 

2616
02:04:56,130 --> 02:04:57,600
transgender or minority because they're 
gay or minority because they're whatever

2617
02:04:57,601 --> 02:04:58,580
the fuck it is.
Yeah.

2618
02:04:59,070 --> 02:04:59,430
Yeah.
No,

2619
02:04:59,431 --> 02:05:00,000
I agree.
I mean,

2620
02:05:00,001 --> 02:05:05,001
I think,
I think probably you don't know what 

2621
02:05:05,001 --> 02:05:05,850
you're getting into when you become a 
cop.

2622
02:05:07,150 --> 02:05:12,150
Come on man.
I have a couple friends and one of the 

2623
02:05:12,150 --> 02:05:15,920
that are cops and one of them was 
talking about working the graveyard 

2624
02:05:15,920 --> 02:05:19,581
shift and Vegas and just go into like 
the worst fucking and just,

2625
02:05:19,830 --> 02:05:24,830
you know,
chasing people on foot while while 

2626
02:05:24,830 --> 02:05:26,340
you're being shot at and just and,
and dealing with the worst,

2627
02:05:26,460 --> 02:05:30,630
the worst of the worst,
which I've heard from multiple cops that

2628
02:05:30,810 --> 02:05:34,410
there's nothing worse than a human being
than pimps.

2629
02:05:34,590 --> 02:05:38,190
That they're just the most skills.
Things that they're like,

2630
02:05:38,191 --> 02:05:39,350
they're worse than murderers,
man.

2631
02:05:39,351 --> 02:05:41,390
That obviously they never listened to a 
too short record.

2632
02:05:41,400 --> 02:05:43,380
What?
Mack Daddy?

2633
02:05:43,890 --> 02:05:44,790
Yeah.
It's pretty,

2634
02:05:44,791 --> 02:05:46,110
um,
pimps,

2635
02:05:46,300 --> 02:05:48,660
hoes down there.
You deal,

2636
02:05:48,661 --> 02:05:51,390
you do deal with pieces of shit all the 
time.

2637
02:05:51,630 --> 02:05:52,950
But pimps,
they're there.

2638
02:05:53,130 --> 02:05:58,130
I mean,
obviously they're taking advantage of 

2639
02:05:58,130 --> 02:05:58,130
very vulnerable people to stealing their
money.

2640
02:05:58,210 --> 02:05:59,610
Yeah.
Exploding the fuck out of them.

2641
02:05:59,660 --> 02:06:01,860
It's one of the reasons why prostitution
should be legal.

2642
02:06:01,861 --> 02:06:03,530
Prostitution was legal.
Get rid of.

2643
02:06:04,200 --> 02:06:06,600
You're not going to have more hose.
Okay.

2644
02:06:06,601 --> 02:06:08,790
They're just going to be going about it 
in a more legal way.

2645
02:06:08,850 --> 02:06:13,850
More upfront way.
It means you see there's girls that are 

2646
02:06:13,850 --> 02:06:13,850
just,
that's just.

2647
02:06:13,850 --> 02:06:14,400
And there's nothing wrong with it.
If it's,

2648
02:06:14,430 --> 02:06:19,430
if it's okay to give people massages,
how come it's not okay to joke someone 

2649
02:06:19,430 --> 02:06:19,430
off?

2650
02:06:20,000 --> 02:06:22,950
Tom Can make money off of it.
Yeah.

2651
02:06:24,430 --> 02:06:25,420
Great.
Yeah.

2652
02:06:25,710 --> 02:06:29,240
Just clean up the fucking streets.
Yeah.

2653
02:06:29,760 --> 02:06:31,250
Get those nuts out.
Everyone's got another.

2654
02:06:31,330 --> 02:06:34,080
They got to get out.
That's what I've been saying for fucking

2655
02:06:34,080 --> 02:06:35,370
years and no one wants to listen.
God,

2656
02:06:35,610 --> 02:06:37,770
it dammit.
It only wants to listen.

2657
02:06:38,010 --> 02:06:40,530
I've been saying for years,
this is the way to fix everything.

2658
02:06:40,890 --> 02:06:45,890
Take that load pent up English except to
short kills chicks with his nuts.

2659
02:06:46,231 --> 02:06:48,030
Yeah.
Allegedly it,

2660
02:06:48,240 --> 02:06:50,490
you realize how much he was talking 
about nutting,

2661
02:06:51,340 --> 02:06:53,910
like he doesn't get into the actual 
quantity,

2662
02:06:53,911 --> 02:06:57,480
but if it killed her and might be just a
forest,

2663
02:06:57,690 --> 02:07:01,590
like if it's from the moon under your 
house and kill you.

2664
02:07:01,650 --> 02:07:04,050
Right.
That's an interesting theory.

2665
02:07:04,740 --> 02:07:06,080
I think he blew her back.
Right?

2666
02:07:06,090 --> 02:07:11,090
Like it was like a fucking firehose.
Could've been just a few cells are 

2667
02:07:11,090 --> 02:07:14,790
segways on this show.
It was pretty serious moments ago.

2668
02:07:15,090 --> 02:07:17,810
Well we got a little upset about the PC 
thinking but yeah,

2669
02:07:18,000 --> 02:07:19,440
but,
but rational.

2670
02:07:19,530 --> 02:07:23,820
But I think our point of view is pretty.
It's pretty broad.

2671
02:07:24,030 --> 02:07:29,030
You know,
we're looking at it like no one here is 

2672
02:07:29,030 --> 02:07:29,700
anti gay,
no one here is racist.

2673
02:07:29,701 --> 02:07:32,790
No new at all.
But we also recognize that there's a lot

2674
02:07:32,791 --> 02:07:37,390
of like some Lou really shitty clunky 
thinking that's a part of this,

2675
02:07:37,650 --> 02:07:39,940
this sort of progressive thinking 
movement.

2676
02:07:40,240 --> 02:07:45,240
It was a lot of like really mean shitty 
human beings that are getting away with 

2677
02:07:45,240 --> 02:07:49,561
it because they've adopted this 
particular type of thinking that is 

2678
02:07:49,561 --> 02:07:53,800
acceptable.
Bandwagoning that without thinking.

2679
02:07:53,880 --> 02:07:54,490
Yeah,
just and,

2680
02:07:54,570 --> 02:07:59,570
and being insulting and shitty.
Like I love going to like really super 

2681
02:07:59,570 --> 02:08:03,961
lefty progressive social justice warrior
pages and watch how they're constantly 

2682
02:08:03,961 --> 02:08:06,360
just involved in fights constantly.
They're just shitty human beings,

2683
02:08:06,830 --> 02:08:08,650
mean shitty human.
My favorite.

2684
02:08:08,650 --> 02:08:13,650
I've been to like a gun on my facebook 
page and seeing somebody's light me up 

2685
02:08:13,650 --> 02:08:14,650
about like a joke,
you know,

2686
02:08:15,010 --> 02:08:16,540
fucking piece of shit and Blah Blah 
Blah.

2687
02:08:16,780 --> 02:08:20,860
And I go to their page and in their bio 
is like in Christ we are all one.

2688
02:08:21,310 --> 02:08:23,800
It's all about love.
I'm like,

2689
02:08:23,801 --> 02:08:24,550
wow,
that's,

2690
02:08:24,610 --> 02:08:28,490
that's your bio.
Then you are just like,

2691
02:08:28,720 --> 02:08:30,850
lighten me up.
And taught out there for a pimp.

2692
02:08:31,120 --> 02:08:32,680
Hard man.
It is.

2693
02:08:32,681 --> 02:08:36,300
It's hard for people to figure it out.
She choked on the come.

2694
02:08:37,360 --> 02:08:38,950
She didn't choke to death,
I don't think.

2695
02:08:38,951 --> 02:08:43,180
What is it?
A bus and nut and killed a bitch.

2696
02:08:43,450 --> 02:08:46,240
It might sound sick.
It might be petty,

2697
02:08:46,360 --> 02:08:49,210
but you never got sucked by blow job 
betty.

2698
02:08:49,230 --> 02:08:51,670
Now back in hold on.
Killed earlier,

2699
02:08:51,790 --> 02:08:55,450
so choked on sperm in her windpipe was 
on her face,

2700
02:08:55,900 --> 02:09:00,900
her neck and chest.
And we're sorry to say there's no 

2701
02:09:00,900 --> 02:09:04,081
suspects.
When I saw that my brain click a button 

2702
02:09:04,081 --> 02:09:06,340
and killed a bit.
So bad writing is dog shit.

2703
02:09:06,370 --> 02:09:10,540
How dare you.
How fucking terrible my boy said short.

2704
02:09:10,541 --> 02:09:14,350
Don't worry.
But that next day I read this story.

2705
02:09:16,290 --> 02:09:21,290
How much cough drop syrup was he on?
And then I then it's like,

2706
02:09:22,391 --> 02:09:27,391
I love when they do this.
They songs betty six times fading 

2707
02:09:27,391 --> 02:09:27,391
talking Bro.

2708
02:09:31,450 --> 02:09:36,450
Y'All niggas don't know though.
So are people allowed to use the n word 

2709
02:09:36,450 --> 02:09:40,280
now that Obama said it on market?
What's going on?

2710
02:09:40,290 --> 02:09:43,330
My favorite was the stories for people 
that don't know,

2711
02:09:43,390 --> 02:09:46,680
you know,
he was using it to make a broader point,

2712
02:09:48,130 --> 02:09:50,530
a broader point.
He was talking about like,

2713
02:09:51,520 --> 02:09:54,370
I don't want to misquote him,
but it wasn't like he wasn't like,

2714
02:09:54,371 --> 02:09:56,590
yeah Nigga we should go get something to
drink after this.

2715
02:09:56,591 --> 02:09:57,100
You know,
he wasn't,

2716
02:09:57,250 --> 02:09:58,950
he was talking.
Yeah.

2717
02:09:59,470 --> 02:10:03,640
So He um,
but then somebody put together a list of

2718
02:10:03,760 --> 02:10:06,730
presidents who have actually used that 
word.

2719
02:10:06,731 --> 02:10:08,380
Use that word.
Holy Shit.

2720
02:10:08,470 --> 02:10:13,470
It was hilarious.
Hilarious in that the actual.

2721
02:10:14,770 --> 02:10:15,220
Yeah.
Well,

2722
02:10:15,280 --> 02:10:18,130
I haven't seen this,
but I saw an article about like the,

2723
02:10:18,820 --> 02:10:22,120
the abuse of the word by former 
presidents.

2724
02:10:22,690 --> 02:10:25,390
Look at fucking Richard Nixon telling 
Rumsfeld.

2725
02:10:25,830 --> 02:10:27,640
Um,
what are you saying?

2726
02:10:29,500 --> 02:10:33,530
I'm Richard Nixon.
Obama's and the Dragon Gutter.

2727
02:10:33,531 --> 02:10:33,980
Speak of

2728
02:10:33,980 --> 02:10:37,100
wrap by saying Nigger,
he's not the first president it on tape.

2729
02:10:37,140 --> 02:10:42,140
Que q clips of Richard Nixon telling 
Donald Rumsfeld our niggers are better 

2730
02:10:42,140 --> 02:10:43,910
than their niggers and Lda tape.
Wow.

2731
02:10:44,090 --> 02:10:49,090
LBJ observing,
they're more nigger the voting than 

2732
02:10:49,090 --> 02:10:51,920
white folks.
And that Johnson called the civil rights

2733
02:10:52,160 --> 02:10:53,540
bill.
The nigger bill.

2734
02:10:54,350 --> 02:10:58,190
Like that's how he used it.
Johnson was a piece of shit.

2735
02:10:58,400 --> 02:11:00,410
I mean he was a horrible,
horrible person.

2736
02:11:00,920 --> 02:11:05,110
And if you believe Oliver Stone,
he was the one who had jfk killed.

2737
02:11:05,810 --> 02:11:07,770
Yeah.
I don't know man.

2738
02:11:07,940 --> 02:11:10,820
Well anyway.
And also truman in his writings.

2739
02:11:10,880 --> 02:11:13,130
Oh my Christ.
Truman.

2740
02:11:13,190 --> 02:11:15,020
Truman was like,
really?

2741
02:11:15,140 --> 02:11:17,240
Oh yeah man.
In a different era though.

2742
02:11:17,470 --> 02:11:18,140
It is,
it is.

2743
02:11:18,141 --> 02:11:23,141
It is only credits.
Abraham Lincoln with freeing the slaves 

2744
02:11:23,141 --> 02:11:28,061
and rightly so.
And the whole thing about him being a 

2745
02:11:28,061 --> 02:11:28,540
pioneer of civil rights,
but he in,

2746
02:11:28,820 --> 02:11:33,820
he was like very clear in one of his 
debates that he never felt like black 

2747
02:11:33,820 --> 02:11:33,950
people should be able to vote.

2748
02:11:34,460 --> 02:11:37,610
He never felt like they should be 
totally equal to white people.

2749
02:11:37,670 --> 02:11:40,210
I mean,
it's just like a lot of people,

2750
02:11:40,460 --> 02:11:44,390
if you listened to way the way people 
thought of black people back then,

2751
02:11:44,391 --> 02:11:49,391
a lot of white people that we 
automatically think of a civil rights 

2752
02:11:49,391 --> 02:11:52,190
pioneers or progressive,
like the way people thought back then,

2753
02:11:52,370 --> 02:11:57,370
it was very difficult to get away with 
any sort of equality talk then whether 

2754
02:11:58,671 --> 02:12:00,530
or not they did it because they wanted 
to win debates.

2755
02:12:00,531 --> 02:12:01,640
Like,
let me find it because it's.

2756
02:12:02,160 --> 02:12:06,020
The Nixon quote is pretty fucking crazy.
Did you say the n word?

2757
02:12:06,350 --> 02:12:07,850
I did.
I did.

2758
02:12:07,851 --> 02:12:10,640
I was quoting one of our presidents.
Well,

2759
02:12:10,970 --> 02:12:15,200
a few of our presidents,
there's been a bunch of them.

2760
02:12:15,201 --> 02:12:16,880
Let me read this,
this,

2761
02:12:16,910 --> 02:12:21,910
uh,
this Lincoln thing is fucking crazy 

2762
02:12:21,910 --> 02:12:21,910
though,
man.

2763
02:12:23,030 --> 02:12:23,660
It's,
um,

2764
02:12:23,780 --> 02:12:28,780
it's a very weird quote because you 
realize like the time people were around

2765
02:12:29,361 --> 02:12:29,960
back then.

2766
02:12:30,380 --> 02:12:32,240
Okay,
here I'm 18,

2767
02:12:32,250 --> 02:12:37,250
58.
There was a series of debates with his 

2768
02:12:37,250 --> 02:12:37,370
opponents in the Illinois race for the 
US Senate,

2769
02:12:37,670 --> 02:12:42,670
Stephen Douglas,
who had accused him of supporting Negro 

2770
02:12:42,670 --> 02:12:43,250
equality in there for fourth debate at 
Charleston,

2771
02:12:43,280 --> 02:12:45,170
Illinois.
On September 18th,

2772
02:12:45,171 --> 02:12:46,010
18,
58.

2773
02:12:46,070 --> 02:12:48,830
Nick Lincoln made his position clear.
He says,

2774
02:12:48,831 --> 02:12:52,670
I will say then that I am not,
nor have I ever been,

2775
02:12:52,700 --> 02:12:57,700
nor have been in favor of bringing about
in any way the social and political 

2776
02:12:58,610 --> 02:13:03,610
equality of the white and black racists.
He began going on to say that he opposed

2777
02:13:04,430 --> 02:13:08,300
blacks having the right to vote,
to serve on juries,

2778
02:13:08,540 --> 02:13:12,260
to hold office and to intermarry with 
whites.

2779
02:13:12,710 --> 02:13:17,710
What he did believe that like all men,
blacks had the right to improve their 

2780
02:13:17,710 --> 02:13:21,080
condition in society and to enjoy the 
fruits of their labor.

2781
02:13:21,260 --> 02:13:26,260
In this way,
they were equal to white men and for 

2782
02:13:26,260 --> 02:13:27,320
this reason slavery was inherently 
unjust,

2783
02:13:27,560 --> 02:13:32,220
but thinking about fucking dark,
but how a progressive is even that

2784
02:13:32,400 --> 02:13:35,250
in 1850,
the fact that he's like,

2785
02:13:35,520 --> 02:13:39,010
let's,
let's make some form of you're.

2786
02:13:39,080 --> 02:13:40,410
You're really right.
Yeah.

2787
02:13:40,411 --> 02:13:44,520
That's why you can't.
We can't even frame our minds in a place

2788
02:13:44,521 --> 02:13:47,580
where we really understand what it's 
like to be in 18,

2789
02:13:47,581 --> 02:13:48,640
58,
you know,

2790
02:13:48,810 --> 02:13:50,900
just,
it's not even that.

2791
02:13:50,960 --> 02:13:55,960
That has got to be crazy to more than 
half the population to hear at that 

2792
02:13:56,311 --> 02:13:56,930
time,
you know?

2793
02:13:57,030 --> 02:13:58,790
Well,
especially the population of the south.

2794
02:13:59,130 --> 02:14:00,940
They were like,
what the fuck are you on?

2795
02:14:01,220 --> 02:14:06,220
How about South Carolina?
They're still fucking flying the 

2796
02:14:06,220 --> 02:14:08,541
confederate flag.
They're trying to figure out whether 

2797
02:14:08,541 --> 02:14:10,311
they should tell you,
figure it out when there's biology.

2798
02:14:10,830 --> 02:14:13,410
There's bureaucratic bullshit in the way
of something like that.

2799
02:14:13,440 --> 02:14:16,140
Like what kind of world is it where you 
can be like,

2800
02:14:16,290 --> 02:14:17,570
hey,
let's just take that shit down.

2801
02:14:17,590 --> 02:14:19,110
It's like we've got to get the assembly 
together.

2802
02:14:19,970 --> 02:14:20,820
Vote on.
Yeah,

2803
02:14:20,821 --> 02:14:24,900
and it's like the hanks on vacation and 
Carol's not back either.

2804
02:14:24,960 --> 02:14:27,300
Like we got to get everybody organized 
before we can.

2805
02:14:27,630 --> 02:14:31,700
Somebody can go up there and taste.
Not Allowed and it's more like.

2806
02:14:31,720 --> 02:14:34,800
It's like having the Nazi flag flying.
I saw.

2807
02:14:35,880 --> 02:14:38,190
Was it Andy Richter?
It's about history.

2808
02:14:38,400 --> 02:14:40,700
He tweeted and keep it in the museum 
about prices.

2809
02:14:40,710 --> 02:14:43,530
I learned learning stuff about a twitter
from twitter,

2810
02:14:43,531 --> 02:14:48,531
but he tweeted that he didn't know and I
didn't know either that that flag went 

2811
02:14:48,531 --> 02:14:52,341
up in Charleston in South Carolina in 
1962 as a fuck you to the civil rights 

2812
02:14:53,671 --> 02:14:55,470
movement.
So when you're saying like,

2813
02:14:55,500 --> 02:14:56,370
no,
it's southern pride,

2814
02:14:56,371 --> 02:14:56,850
it's like,
no,

2815
02:14:56,851 --> 02:15:00,880
that went up on that building to say 
fucked civil rights.

2816
02:15:02,010 --> 02:15:05,610
That kind of changes it.
Years after slavery was abolished.

2817
02:15:05,620 --> 02:15:10,620
Yes.
We're totally convinced that's an extra 

2818
02:15:11,731 --> 02:15:14,070
fuck you.
It's a huge extra fuck you.

2819
02:15:14,490 --> 02:15:19,490
But then people,
it's all the stuff we were talking 

2820
02:15:19,490 --> 02:15:19,490
about.
It's like people,

2821
02:15:19,490 --> 02:15:22,920
the reactions to Obama's use of it in 
and not hearing what he's saying.

2822
02:15:22,960 --> 02:15:25,530
Of course they're like,
they're acting like he's just,

2823
02:15:25,531 --> 02:15:28,800
you know,
throwing it around casually.

2824
02:15:28,801 --> 02:15:33,801
Like who's the least happy Mark Marin's 
old manager told him he never worked 

2825
02:15:33,801 --> 02:15:38,451
out.
He got fucking president to say and I 

2826
02:15:39,330 --> 02:15:44,330
double g.dot
g e r what kind of damage?

2827
02:15:44,410 --> 02:15:46,620
I think that episode will get fucking 
trillion.

2828
02:15:46,621 --> 02:15:51,621
It's probably going to break the 
Internet thinks more than Kim 

2829
02:15:51,621 --> 02:15:51,621
Kardashian's ass.
It's going to be crazy.

2830
02:15:51,621 --> 02:15:52,740
That's breaking the Internet.
Yeah,

2831
02:15:52,741 --> 02:15:57,741
it's probably going to get my.
It'll be number one across the country 

2832
02:15:57,741 --> 02:16:01,341
for sure for a while and it I'd probably
get millions and millions and millions 

2833
02:16:01,341 --> 02:16:02,250
of downloads.
He set up another website for it.

2834
02:16:02,370 --> 02:16:04,020
Did he really?
Yeah,

2835
02:16:04,021 --> 02:16:04,920
I saw that tweet,
like,

2836
02:16:04,921 --> 02:16:05,820
um,
hey,

2837
02:16:05,821 --> 02:16:07,950
if you're having trouble getting it 
here,

2838
02:16:08,310 --> 02:16:12,240
I set up like mark meets.
Obama is a whole other side,

2839
02:16:13,230 --> 02:16:15,260
like photos czar.
Yeah.

2840
02:16:15,570 --> 02:16:18,000
Weird world we live in.
It's fascinating though.

2841
02:16:18,360 --> 02:16:23,360
I mean on a much smaller scale.
Obviously the success that you and I 

2842
02:16:23,360 --> 02:16:24,660
have had all of us have had with 
podcasting is pretty.

2843
02:16:24,780 --> 02:16:26,850
It's been very strange,
you know,

2844
02:16:26,851 --> 02:16:29,880
easy.
We just shot a pilot because apoe test.

2845
02:16:30,000 --> 02:16:31,930
Yeah,
it's so crazy.

2846
02:16:31,931 --> 02:16:36,931
But your show really should be some sort
of a show and that's the best way to do 

2847
02:16:36,931 --> 02:16:40,831
it.
I mean if someone was smart and they 

2848
02:16:40,831 --> 02:16:42,691
wanted to have a TV show based on your 
show and the interactions that you guys 

2849
02:16:42,691 --> 02:16:45,160
have with your fans and then going to 
shows it means it's a no brainer.

2850
02:16:45,220 --> 02:16:46,690
I mean it's,
it's guaranteed.

2851
02:16:46,710 --> 02:16:49,840
I mean,
if you get the Duggar's 19 fuck,

2852
02:16:49,890 --> 02:16:51,420
they just like,
fuck yeah,

2853
02:16:51,580 --> 02:16:56,580
we like to fuck.
And we treat our kids like my baby's 

2854
02:16:56,580 --> 02:16:56,580
weight active.
We like to fuck.

2855
02:16:56,580 --> 02:16:59,530
And we teach our kids nonsense.
I think one of my kids,

2856
02:16:59,531 --> 02:17:04,531
fuck one of my other kids,
but I ain't paying attention is too 

2857
02:17:04,531 --> 02:17:04,531
many,
but I say I say the,

2858
02:17:04,531 --> 02:17:09,511
uh,
the pilot thing that we shot in that 

2859
02:17:09,511 --> 02:17:12,421
like we never anticipated going into 
recording a show that like a production 

2860
02:17:12,671 --> 02:17:14,720
company in a network will be like,
let's make a tea.

2861
02:17:14,750 --> 02:17:15,470
You know what I mean?
Like we,

2862
02:17:15,830 --> 02:17:19,000
we sit in our house and we just record 
the show and then,

2863
02:17:19,590 --> 02:17:24,590
you know,
the road has been so much better to us 

2864
02:17:24,590 --> 02:17:24,590
and it will evolve.
Fucking podcast man.

2865
02:17:24,590 --> 02:17:26,230
I mean,
you're selling all these crazy places,

2866
02:17:26,410 --> 02:17:29,350
but you know what ultimately is what's 
hilarious is the TV show is not going to

2867
02:17:29,351 --> 02:17:32,830
mean shit that the Internet is what's 
gonna be.

2868
02:17:32,930 --> 02:17:35,440
The podcast is the best part to what I 
did.

2869
02:17:35,441 --> 02:17:37,840
Your podcasts,
your podcast is fucking fun.

2870
02:17:38,050 --> 02:17:39,550
It's really,
really fun.

2871
02:17:39,551 --> 02:17:41,560
It's funny.
It's really fun.

2872
02:17:41,561 --> 02:17:43,990
It's fun to do.
And you guys have a down,

2873
02:17:43,991 --> 02:17:48,991
you know,
you guys have a groove and it's 

2874
02:17:48,991 --> 02:17:48,991
hilarious to listen to.
It's a.

2875
02:17:48,991 --> 02:17:49,090
it's a great,
really entertaining thing.

2876
02:17:49,360 --> 02:17:54,360
Way more entertaining than any fucking 
sitcoms way more entertaining than any 

2877
02:17:54,360 --> 02:17:58,591
talk show.
There's not a Goddamn talk show on 

2878
02:17:58,591 --> 02:17:58,850
television that is entertaining as your 
podcast,

2879
02:17:59,930 --> 02:18:00,300
but that's.

2880
02:18:00,550 --> 02:18:05,550
But that's true.
I mean even if they take your show and 

2881
02:18:05,550 --> 02:18:05,550
put it on television,
it's not going to be as good.

2882
02:18:05,830 --> 02:18:10,830
It'll get more people to watch.
It'll get more people to listen to the 

2883
02:18:10,830 --> 02:18:13,741
real thing and that's ultimately good,
but the reality is your show is growing 

2884
02:18:13,741 --> 02:18:16,990
exponentially just by word of mouth.
People were hearing about it.

2885
02:18:16,991 --> 02:18:18,850
They spray.
You can come on other people's podcasts,

2886
02:18:18,851 --> 02:18:22,810
they talk about it and that's what's 
happening to all of us.

2887
02:18:22,811 --> 02:18:27,811
Like there's this exponential thing 
that's going on when we do each other 

2888
02:18:27,811 --> 02:18:28,440
shows and then it builds up.
It's like it,

2889
02:18:28,510 --> 02:18:33,510
it,
it juices us all up in some sort of a 

2890
02:18:33,510 --> 02:18:33,910
weird way.
I think it's how is this going to change

2891
02:18:34,110 --> 02:18:39,110
and eventually has to change television 
because if you get the real deal when 

2892
02:18:40,481 --> 02:18:45,481
you're listening to podcasts,
how can you go and watch a TV show if 

2893
02:18:45,481 --> 02:18:49,060
it's not like a Netflix show hbo show,
but most of them,

2894
02:18:50,200 --> 02:18:51,880
this is what television is good for.

2895
02:18:51,970 --> 02:18:54,250
Game of thrones,
house of cards,

2896
02:18:54,370 --> 02:18:57,600
shows that are like productions madman.
You produce,

2897
02:18:57,760 --> 02:19:02,760
you're producing some.
You have to have fucking cameras and 

2898
02:19:02,760 --> 02:19:05,341
writers and all this.
That is still and that's actually a lot 

2899
02:19:05,341 --> 02:19:09,691
of ways better than films.
There's a lot of films that can fulfill 

2900
02:19:09,691 --> 02:19:10,500
them away.
TV for the last five,

2901
02:19:10,530 --> 02:19:15,530
seven years has taken a colossal dump on
a lot of film is a lot of film is really

2902
02:19:17,440 --> 02:19:19,760
shit.
Especially blockbusters.

2903
02:19:20,810 --> 02:19:22,710
Did you see x Mokena?
Yes.

2904
02:19:23,420 --> 02:19:25,630
Was great,
but that's rare.

2905
02:19:26,110 --> 02:19:31,110
It's rare to come to come up with a film
that gets produced and distributed out 

2906
02:19:31,110 --> 02:19:31,110
like,
yeah,

2907
02:19:31,110 --> 02:19:32,570
they're just rocks your world where 
you're like,

2908
02:19:32,571 --> 02:19:34,040
whoa,
that was fucking cool.

2909
02:19:34,580 --> 02:19:35,600
I love that movie.
I was like,

2910
02:19:35,601 --> 02:19:37,610
that was on the best movies I've seen in
a long,

2911
02:19:37,611 --> 02:19:40,520
long time.
The TV is doing that shit like weekly,

2912
02:19:41,060 --> 02:19:42,950
weekly.
They're putting out amazing,

2913
02:19:42,951 --> 02:19:46,220
amazing content.
Have you watched the new version of true

2914
02:19:46,221 --> 02:19:48,620
detective?
I just saw episode one.

2915
02:19:48,621 --> 02:19:49,420
Yeah,
I did too.

2916
02:19:49,640 --> 02:19:54,640
And haven't gotten into it yet.
I watched last season fucking end up 

2917
02:19:54,640 --> 02:19:56,000
fucking good.
It's HBO.

2918
02:19:56,001 --> 02:19:57,930
It's just knocking it out of the sun.
Right.

2919
02:19:58,070 --> 02:19:58,970
So good.
But.

2920
02:19:58,990 --> 02:20:03,830
So is Netflix to orange is the new black
or wife is into that shit.

2921
02:20:03,860 --> 02:20:04,730
Me Too.
I've seen.

2922
02:20:04,740 --> 02:20:06,620
I've seen everything and I rewatched 
them.

2923
02:20:06,621 --> 02:20:08,150
I'm so into that damn show.

2924
02:20:11,780 --> 02:20:14,840
Billy birds doing a sitcom or not a 
sitcom.

2925
02:20:14,841 --> 02:20:18,210
A cartoon based on his own life.
Definitely Netflix.

2926
02:20:18,500 --> 02:20:19,130
Fuck.
Yeah.

2927
02:20:19,810 --> 02:20:23,690
And his a Netflix special was giant for 
him.

2928
02:20:23,810 --> 02:20:26,720
Just like your netflix specials.
Fucking been giant for you.

2929
02:20:26,770 --> 02:20:28,890
Yeah,
it's been great to fuck dude.

2930
02:20:28,900 --> 02:20:33,900
We live in a weird world.
I know people will go and then like our 

2931
02:20:33,900 --> 02:20:38,710
people are tapped in with what we do.
Everyone kind of knows but like it's 

2932
02:20:38,710 --> 02:20:38,750
funny,
like I meet people and they're like,

2933
02:20:38,751 --> 02:20:41,420
what if I've seen you on something?
I'll be like a,

2934
02:20:41,510 --> 02:20:42,830
like a show.
No.

2935
02:20:43,340 --> 02:20:48,340
This thing on Netflix and it's the 
people who are not in our kind of like,

2936
02:20:49,400 --> 02:20:50,150
oh,
okay,

2937
02:20:50,870 --> 02:20:55,040
but then everybody who was kind of young
kids young into it,

2938
02:20:55,041 --> 02:20:55,790
they're like,
oh yeah,

2939
02:20:55,791 --> 02:20:57,320
of course.
The all young kids,

2940
02:20:57,350 --> 02:20:59,810
your parents say you can't watch any TV,
but you have a laptop.

2941
02:20:59,810 --> 02:21:01,370
You sit,
you sit in your room,

2942
02:21:01,610 --> 02:21:03,260
your whole house houses,
all Wifi.

2943
02:21:03,470 --> 02:21:05,150
When you're online,
you're watching movies.

2944
02:21:05,151 --> 02:21:07,430
Parents don't know shit.
They don't know shit.

2945
02:21:07,431 --> 02:21:10,490
I mean that's the future.
The future is Netflix and the future is.

2946
02:21:10,670 --> 02:21:15,670
The only problem that I have with those 
things is that you can't download them 

2947
02:21:15,670 --> 02:21:18,671
onto your computer.
Like if you go on a plane flying over 

2948
02:21:18,671 --> 02:21:18,970
China,
it's a bummer.

2949
02:21:19,010 --> 02:21:20,660
Why is that?
Well,

2950
02:21:20,661 --> 02:21:21,430
those,
I don't know.

2951
02:21:21,650 --> 02:21:26,650
I mean they said that like the speed 
that you can get on a plane just won't 

2952
02:21:26,650 --> 02:21:28,730
support streaming.
You download it.

2953
02:21:29,000 --> 02:21:30,920
They want you to have to go there for 
play,

2954
02:21:31,130 --> 02:21:35,420
but they should also have an option,
a download option just for the media,

2955
02:21:35,421 --> 02:21:37,400
like on camping trips or some shit like 
that.

2956
02:21:37,760 --> 02:21:38,450
I agree.
I mean,

2957
02:21:38,451 --> 02:21:38,750
I,
I,

2958
02:21:38,751 --> 02:21:42,990
sometimes we buy kind of marketing my 
dad to buy the,

2959
02:21:43,120 --> 02:21:45,870
you buy on itunes all the time.
I mean,

2960
02:21:45,910 --> 02:21:47,000
uh,
I watched that.

2961
02:21:47,001 --> 02:21:48,020
Um,
John Wick,

2962
02:21:48,260 --> 02:21:49,330
you know that movie John?
Well,

2963
02:21:49,340 --> 02:21:51,140
I have that on my ipad.
I bought that.

2964
02:21:51,141 --> 02:21:51,860
I haven't watched it yet.

2965
02:21:54,560 --> 02:21:57,320
It's new.
It's fucking great.

2966
02:21:57,950 --> 02:22:00,380
It's one of the best,
like action,

2967
02:22:00,381 --> 02:22:02,830
crazy psycho movies I've seen in a long 
time.

2968
02:22:02,920 --> 02:22:04,790
That bottle locking.
Great.

2969
02:22:05,060 --> 02:22:07,250
Talk to me after you do go do your 
podcast next,

2970
02:22:07,251 --> 02:22:10,810
after you watch it and you will have a 
long John what they're doing.

2971
02:22:10,820 --> 02:22:12,650
John Wick two,
you know,

2972
02:22:12,870 --> 02:22:15,070
Shit.
After you watched the end of that movie,

2973
02:22:15,190 --> 02:22:17,210
this movie's over.
Everyone's going to jail.

2974
02:22:17,211 --> 02:22:20,810
Everyone's dead like it's fucking chaos.
It's a fun.

2975
02:22:20,990 --> 02:22:23,060
It's so many people dying.
That fucking movie.

2976
02:22:23,061 --> 02:22:25,350
Like Jesus Christ,
halfway of movie.

2977
02:22:25,351 --> 02:22:27,930
You have to like pause it and catch your
heart rate up.

2978
02:22:27,931 --> 02:22:30,260
I'll hand you the IPAD.
You can watch it on mine.

2979
02:22:30,261 --> 02:22:31,560
I have it on.
Bought it.

2980
02:22:31,561 --> 02:22:33,650
So it's madness.
It's fun.

2981
02:22:33,730 --> 02:22:35,280
It is fun.
It's drastic world.

2982
02:22:35,281 --> 02:22:38,130
I haven't seen or heard by the way your 
boy.

2983
02:22:38,190 --> 02:22:39,690
I see.
I see him pop tate Fletcher.

2984
02:22:39,690 --> 02:22:41,460
He's.
He's in John Wick two.

2985
02:22:41,700 --> 02:22:44,630
I was pacing the equalizer and I watched
that.

2986
02:22:44,650 --> 02:22:47,670
I saw him in.
That takes up like the world trade.

2987
02:22:48,260 --> 02:22:49,290
Yeah.
He's killing it.

2988
02:22:49,350 --> 02:22:51,940
Tate's killing it.
I go,

2989
02:22:52,460 --> 02:22:54,210

Fucking know him.

2990
02:22:54,390 --> 02:22:54,790

Wow.
Very aggressive.

2993
02:22:58,770 --> 02:22:59,440
Very aggressive.
Yeah.

2994
02:22:59,441 --> 02:23:01,740
He's constantly filming movies.
He's off right now.

2995
02:23:01,910 --> 02:23:06,910
Just doing one.
He's just a dude that don't change that

No,
he's awesome.

2998
02:23:07,950 --> 02:23:11,220
But he's just a great guy too.
He's got great energy behind him.

2999
02:23:11,240 --> 02:23:16,240
You know,
he's such a till I tie fighter.

3000
02:23:18,840 --> 02:23:22,590
Yes.
Works out caveman coffee.

3001
02:23:23,140 --> 02:23:25,060

3005
02:23:31,971 --> 02:23:31,971
company.
Good for that.

3006
02:23:31,971 --> 02:23:33,690
They have these new,
a caveman drinks called nitro.

3007
02:23:33,940 --> 02:23:38,940
It's like a cold brew coffee,
like nitrogenated cold brew coffee and 

3008
02:23:38,940 --> 02:23:39,810
it's in a little can.

3009
02:23:40,110 --> 02:23:41,430
Holy Shit.
It's fucking great.

3010
02:23:41,520 --> 02:23:45,930
I have a time that I am to one and a

3012
02:23:47,371 --> 02:23:48,960
I grabbing those caveman's run out the 
door.

3013
02:23:48,961 --> 02:23:50,130
I'm like,
this is fucking great.

3014
02:23:50,230 --> 02:23:51,720

You would,

3015
02:23:51,990 --> 02:23:56,990

3016
02:23:56,990 --> 02:24:00,361
podcasts.
I will bring a case of Caveman 

3017
02:24:00,361 --> 02:24:02,421
nitrogenated coffee.
I'll have them send it to you to come 

3018
02:24:02,421 --> 02:24:02,421
into the new office.
Dude.

3019
02:24:02,421 --> 02:24:03,090
Fuck yeah.
Brown new studio.

3020
02:24:03,290 --> 02:24:05,760
And it's a very close to the old office.
Uh,

3021
02:24:06,230 --> 02:24:11,230
yes.
What kind of an officer did you guys 

3022
02:24:11,230 --> 02:24:11,230
get?
Jus Scout around or just.

3023
02:24:11,230 --> 02:24:13,860
We did one of the first place we found 
is a great area.

3024
02:24:13,861 --> 02:24:16,110
It's cool building like how many square 
feet?

3025
02:24:16,410 --> 02:24:21,410
Not like 300.
So it was like about the size of this 

3026
02:24:21,410 --> 02:24:21,410
room.
Yeah.

3027
02:24:21,410 --> 02:24:21,410
But sounds perfect.
That's all you need.

3028
02:24:21,410 --> 02:24:21,530
That's all you need.
Yeah.

3029
02:24:21,570 --> 02:24:23,100
I have all this extra space.
It's funny,

3030
02:24:23,340 --> 02:24:26,160
I didn't know.
Neither one of us knew what the um,

3031
02:24:26,310 --> 02:24:29,550
like about like really what that looks 
like before we experienced it.

3032
02:24:29,551 --> 02:24:31,200
So when you call and they're like,
yeah,

3033
02:24:31,201 --> 02:24:31,860
it's like,
you know,

3034
02:24:31,870 --> 02:24:32,850
300 square feet.
I'm like,

3035
02:24:32,851 --> 02:24:34,140
what is that?
A fucking closet.

3036
02:24:36,090 --> 02:24:38,010
No idea.
So I thought it was going to be like you

3037
02:24:38,011 --> 02:24:41,040
open the door and then that's the back 
of the room and I was like,

3038
02:24:41,070 --> 02:24:42,510
oh no,
this is plenty of space.

3039
02:24:42,840 --> 02:24:45,770
Like your college studio apartments.
They're like,

3040
02:24:45,780 --> 02:24:46,560
what are you looking for?
I was like,

3041
02:24:46,561 --> 02:24:47,970
I don't know.
I don't know,

3042
02:24:47,971 --> 02:24:50,510
like 1500 scripts.
I had no idea looking at.

3043
02:24:50,520 --> 02:24:54,630
I think this is what is this?
Two thousand 500 something?

3044
02:24:54,631 --> 02:24:55,770
Square feet.
Everything you mean?

3045
02:24:55,880 --> 02:24:57,600
Everything back.
The garage.

3046
02:24:57,660 --> 02:25:00,690
The whole front where the pool table.
This is your car back yet?

3047
02:25:00,830 --> 02:25:02,820
Either way it gets back today.
Oh,

3048
02:25:02,821 --> 02:25:03,780
today at 8:00
PM.

3049
02:25:05,680 --> 02:25:06,810
My Porsche does.
Yeah.

3050
02:25:06,811 --> 02:25:08,730
Yeah.
The corvette still being worked on.

3051
02:25:09,090 --> 02:25:09,840
Nice.
Wait,

3052
02:25:09,841 --> 02:25:11,880
the corvette is being like souped up 
more.

3053
02:25:12,190 --> 02:25:14,360
I had a lot of shit done.
Do you describe it?

3054
02:25:14,850 --> 02:25:15,680
Yeah,
I had.

3055
02:25:15,750 --> 02:25:20,750
The interior was like a burgundy.
I turned to black custom black interior.

3056
02:25:22,230 --> 02:25:24,600
Are you excited to get the Porsche back 
baby?

3057
02:25:24,690 --> 02:25:25,980
Yeah,
that's my motherfucker.

3058
02:25:26,030 --> 02:25:31,030
Yeah,
that's the greatest car I've ever owned 

3059
02:25:31,030 --> 02:25:31,030
for sure by far.
And you know,

3060
02:25:31,030 --> 02:25:34,150
it's funny like I had it at the Improv.
Somebody goes what years ago?

3061
02:25:34,270 --> 02:25:36,160
Two thousand seven and the guy goes,
why don't you get a new one?

3062
02:25:37,600 --> 02:25:40,050
Get out of here.
I understand what you're seeing,

3063
02:25:40,430 --> 02:25:41,920
what you're seeing.
You don't understand what you're talking

3064
02:25:41,921 --> 02:25:43,060
about and understanding what you're 
saying.

3065
02:25:43,650 --> 02:25:45,550
They don't make these anymore.
Do you understand that?

3066
02:25:45,640 --> 02:25:46,840
They don't make them like this anymore.

3067
02:25:46,970 --> 02:25:51,970
Fuck,
but there's a certain year where you go 

3068
02:25:51,970 --> 02:25:51,970
back to it.
They don't say that anymore.

3069
02:25:51,970 --> 02:25:53,490
Like if you have a 19,
65 corvette bunch,

3070
02:25:53,590 --> 02:25:54,610
get a new one.
Nice.

3071
02:25:55,680 --> 02:25:59,110
All right man.
It's 50 years old.

3072
02:25:59,111 --> 02:26:02,090
You fuck what you're saying?
I'm excited because I just.

3073
02:26:02,091 --> 02:26:07,091
I love car shopping and in about six 
months it's going to be sub time again.

3074
02:26:07,210 --> 02:26:10,060
Oh Shit.
What you're gonna get.

3075
02:26:10,300 --> 02:26:12,680
I don't know.
Come out and see my lexus.

3076
02:26:12,720 --> 02:26:15,490
I have a lexus suv.
The lx five 70.

3077
02:26:15,640 --> 02:26:17,080
Like that.
Drive around that thing man.

3078
02:26:17,081 --> 02:26:20,170
It's like floating in the cloud.
That car is just so quiet.

3079
02:26:21,190 --> 02:26:24,510
That car relaxes me.
I'm not bullshitting.

3080
02:26:24,530 --> 02:26:27,970
It relaxes me when I drive it around.
It's so soft.

3081
02:26:27,971 --> 02:26:32,971
I was,
I was in Atlanta and I rented a Tahoe 

3082
02:26:32,971 --> 02:26:33,100
and I was like,
well I liked this full size shit.

3083
02:26:33,130 --> 02:26:36,640
So then I test drove a Denali.

3084
02:26:36,730 --> 02:26:37,960
Oh,
those are great new one.

3085
02:26:38,020 --> 02:26:40,090
Oh yeah.
Well those new cadillacs to,

3086
02:26:40,091 --> 02:26:41,590
they have that.
All those GM cars,

3087
02:26:41,591 --> 02:26:43,900
they have this new magnetic ride 
suspension.

3088
02:26:43,960 --> 02:26:44,770
Yeah.
Yeah.

3089
02:26:44,771 --> 02:26:46,690
This,
these magnetics suspensions.

3090
02:26:46,691 --> 02:26:48,880
They have like a circle variable 
suspension.

3091
02:26:48,881 --> 02:26:51,340
So it kind of understands what's 
happening on the road.

3092
02:26:51,970 --> 02:26:52,780
We live in.
Weird,

3093
02:26:52,840 --> 02:26:54,100
weird,
weird times.

3094
02:26:54,420 --> 02:26:57,320
I rented a little Volkswagen Beetle.
No,

3095
02:26:58,220 --> 02:27:00,160
no,
around Denver.

3096
02:27:00,640 --> 02:27:01,550
And uh,
you know,

3097
02:27:01,560 --> 02:27:06,560
you get so lazy because we got a car 
that beeps every time you get into the 

3098
02:27:06,560 --> 02:27:08,270
other lane and then jobs for you.
And for you.

3099
02:27:09,070 --> 02:27:10,690
That's crazy.
That was killed myself.

3100
02:27:12,430 --> 02:27:14,850
I got to turn my head to look back with 
the look.

3101
02:27:14,860 --> 02:27:16,960
When you're backing up you have a backup
cam.

3102
02:27:17,320 --> 02:27:19,990
What kind of nonsense is that bullshit 
bullshit.

3103
02:27:20,050 --> 02:27:21,360
Bullshit.
No.

3104
02:27:22,480 --> 02:27:23,680
Well,
the new car is like,

3105
02:27:23,710 --> 02:27:27,550
they have like lights that light up like
on your lane,

3106
02:27:27,580 --> 02:27:32,580
like if you're in the,
if you're in one lane and if someone to 

3107
02:27:32,580 --> 02:27:32,580
your right,
a light goes on,

3108
02:27:32,580 --> 02:27:33,850
we have to let you know someone's over 
there.

3109
02:27:33,850 --> 02:27:35,570
It's just that they're there as they're 
passing.

3110
02:27:36,050 --> 02:27:39,100
You can put the speedometer in the 
windshield,

3111
02:27:39,280 --> 02:27:43,270
you have heads up display.
Has the new corvette has that.

3112
02:27:43,271 --> 02:27:45,220
It's insane.
That new corvette.

3113
02:27:45,221 --> 02:27:45,940
By the way,
I've.

3114
02:27:46,120 --> 02:27:51,120
I've made fun of corvettes in my act for
a while because basically have like the 

3115
02:27:51,120 --> 02:27:52,590
guy that would get it right.
You can go change.

3116
02:27:52,591 --> 02:27:57,591
Yeah.
And there were the dad boner that would 

3117
02:27:57,591 --> 02:27:57,591
just fuck it.
Boner.

3118
02:27:57,591 --> 02:28:00,550
But then you see the news and you're 
like,

3119
02:28:00,640 --> 02:28:05,640
what?
It's one of the best sports cars in the 

3120
02:28:05,640 --> 02:28:05,640
world.
Yeah.

3121
02:28:05,640 --> 02:28:05,640
Yeah.
Cool looking.

3122
02:28:05,640 --> 02:28:08,500
It handles insane.
The interior is amazing and the speed is

3123
02:28:08,501 --> 02:28:11,230
just gave you a monster monster on 
wheels.

3124
02:28:11,231 --> 02:28:11,770
Yeah.
Yeah.

3125
02:28:11,771 --> 02:28:16,771
It's a crazy car.
They finally figured out how to do it 

3126
02:28:16,771 --> 02:28:16,771
right.
But there's a bunch of new cars that are

3127
02:28:16,771 --> 02:28:17,980
crazy.
The new American cars,

3128
02:28:17,981 --> 02:28:19,870
the new [inaudible] 28 Camaro,
Z,

3129
02:28:19,990 --> 02:28:21,440
28,
500,

3130
02:28:21,441 --> 02:28:23,990
five horsepower faster around the ring.

3131
02:28:24,000 --> 02:28:25,370
That a porsche 9:11
turbo.

3132
02:28:25,770 --> 02:28:28,520
That hellcat challenger.
I drove one of those.

3133
02:28:28,550 --> 02:28:29,780
How'd you like that?
I loved it.

3134
02:28:29,810 --> 02:28:30,320
Fun,
right?

3135
02:28:30,360 --> 02:28:31,250
Yeah.
The Srt,

3136
02:28:31,251 --> 02:28:34,400
they gave me one when I was in Denver 
when I was filling my special fuck.

3137
02:28:34,460 --> 02:28:35,990
Yeah,
they gave me one for the weekend.

3138
02:28:36,020 --> 02:28:37,570
Come on.
That's got to be a thrill address.

3139
02:28:37,580 --> 02:28:40,800
So fun.
Jamie was in poor bastard.

3140
02:28:40,801 --> 02:28:41,550
Screams,
right?

3141
02:28:41,570 --> 02:28:43,490
It's got to be 700,
seven horsepower.

3142
02:28:43,540 --> 02:28:48,540
Great.
Seven hundred and 70 horsepower from a 

3143
02:28:48,540 --> 02:28:48,680
car.
They challenger charger too though.

3144
02:28:49,360 --> 02:28:51,980
The four door charger,
which is a fucking sacrilege.

3145
02:28:51,981 --> 02:28:53,930
They turned a charger into a formula.
That's crazy.

3146
02:28:53,931 --> 02:28:57,200
It used to be the dukes of hazzard car,
but that challenger.

3147
02:28:57,780 --> 02:29:00,740
That's right.
Forgot about that challenger could never

3148
02:29:00,741 --> 02:29:03,230
have that today and that love that they 
give you.

3149
02:29:03,290 --> 02:29:06,680
There's two separate keys and the red 
one.

3150
02:29:06,681 --> 02:29:09,890
That means 700 horsepower and then if 
you want to dial it back,

3151
02:29:09,891 --> 02:29:12,820
like if a friend or the valet,
you give them the black and that.

3152
02:29:13,010 --> 02:29:15,630
That brings it down to like 500.
Yeah,

3153
02:29:16,200 --> 02:29:17,620
so it's not all the way opened up.
You know,

3154
02:29:18,320 --> 02:29:21,000
control how fast somebody can go based 
on the key,

3155
02:29:21,410 --> 02:29:22,850
the amount of horsepower,
horsepower.

3156
02:29:23,300 --> 02:29:27,670
But it's so ridiculous because 505 
horsepower is so fucking stupid fast.

3157
02:29:27,680 --> 02:29:32,680
Yeah.
It's like 700 horsepower is almost 

3158
02:29:32,680 --> 02:29:32,680
crazy.
Oh no,

3159
02:29:32,680 --> 02:29:32,930
sorry.
They have that.

3160
02:29:32,931 --> 02:29:37,931
It's the two keys and on top of that you
can put valet with a code into the 

3161
02:29:38,330 --> 02:29:42,490
computer and your screen and that'll 
drop it down to like 2:30

3162
02:29:42,491 --> 02:29:43,330
or.
Oh,

3163
02:29:43,340 --> 02:29:44,660
that makes sense.
There's like three.

3164
02:29:44,690 --> 02:29:46,670
There's three ways you give them a 
Volkswagen engine.

3165
02:29:47,270 --> 02:29:51,920
Give them that fucking beetle beetle can
haul ass girl can run.

3166
02:29:52,050 --> 02:29:57,050
Well.
People do do horrible things that 

3167
02:29:57,050 --> 02:29:57,080
people's Valet cars.
You hear about that shit all the time.

3168
02:29:57,650 --> 02:30:02,650
Tara,
can you imagine guy in Laguna beach 

3169
02:30:02,650 --> 02:30:03,560
crashed like a $500,000
Ferrari.

3170
02:30:03,910 --> 02:30:08,910
They had some 18 year old Mexican kid 
who was driving who valet park cars 

3171
02:30:09,140 --> 02:30:10,340
because he was just.

3172
02:30:10,340 --> 02:30:13,070
He was just happen to Mexican and took 
it.

3173
02:30:13,071 --> 02:30:15,140
So he didn't have any gang tattoos for 
many gangs.

3174
02:30:15,141 --> 02:30:16,970
He didn't belong in there,
so weird.

3175
02:30:17,030 --> 02:30:22,030
And the he crashed into a fucking pole.
He did not handle the car and went 

3176
02:30:22,030 --> 02:30:25,541
sideways.
Have you seen that video of Eddie 

3177
02:30:25,541 --> 02:30:25,541
Griffin did crash in that Ferrari?
That was a million dollar car.

3178
02:30:25,541 --> 02:30:29,900
Oh,
he crashed and Enzo into a fucking 

3179
02:30:29,900 --> 02:30:31,820
concrete wall.
Those pylons.

3180
02:30:31,821 --> 02:30:33,830
What are those things?
Those concrete dividers?

3181
02:30:33,980 --> 02:30:38,980
Yeah.
What do you think he got out and was 

3182
02:30:38,980 --> 02:30:38,980
like my bad.
Well,

3183
02:30:38,980 --> 02:30:39,230
he said a brother,
you know,

3184
02:30:39,231 --> 02:30:40,760
brother can't drive.
That's what he said.

3185
02:30:40,790 --> 02:30:41,650
Oh,
something like that.

3186
02:30:41,670 --> 02:30:46,670
But,
but the fact that they let him drive 

3187
02:30:46,670 --> 02:30:49,391
that car without knowing whether or not 
he could drive the guy who owned that 

3188
02:30:49,391 --> 02:30:50,350
car is a fucking moron.
You know?

3189
02:30:50,351 --> 02:30:51,110
I would've been like,
whoa,

3190
02:30:51,111 --> 02:30:51,410
Whoa,
Whoa,

3191
02:30:51,420 --> 02:30:51,950
Whoa,
Whoa,

3192
02:30:52,040 --> 02:30:52,770
wait a minute,
wait a minute.

3193
02:30:52,790 --> 02:30:53,570
Wait.
First of all,

3194
02:30:53,630 --> 02:30:55,910
do you not drive a car that you have you
ever.

3195
02:30:55,911 --> 02:30:57,890
What happens when it goes sideways and 
gas right?

3196
02:30:57,891 --> 02:30:58,460
Brake.
Left.

3197
02:30:58,610 --> 02:30:59,120
Yeah.
We good?

3198
02:31:00,800 --> 02:31:01,370
Yeah,
that's it.

3199
02:31:01,390 --> 02:31:02,780
I've seen the.
You've seen the video.

3200
02:31:03,230 --> 02:31:08,230
It's horrible.
It's horrible to watch because I think 

3201
02:31:08,230 --> 02:31:09,050
the car was totaled.
He crushes that thing with front end.

3202
02:31:09,530 --> 02:31:14,530
We didn't know how to stop,
like he just didn't know what he's 

3203
02:31:14,530 --> 02:31:16,691
doing.
He just tries to take like sometimes 

3204
02:31:16,691 --> 02:31:16,691
people just get so carried away with 
horsepower,

3205
02:31:16,850 --> 02:31:19,040
they just don't know what the fuck to 
do.

3206
02:31:19,290 --> 02:31:24,290
And then one of the best videos ever is,
is this porsche nine slash six slash 

3207
02:31:24,290 --> 02:31:28,470
four RSR and it's in some sort of a 
rally and as they're coming around the 

3208
02:31:28,470 --> 02:31:32,631
toe hits the same thing,
but it launches into the air and goes 

3209
02:31:32,631 --> 02:31:35,280
flying into a river like right in front 
of all these people pull.

3210
02:31:35,310 --> 02:31:40,310
Pull this video up.
Porsche our nine slash 11 rsr crash.

3211
02:31:41,910 --> 02:31:46,560
It's the most ridiculous crash.
You gotta see this crash because this is

3212
02:31:46,561 --> 02:31:51,561
a race.
So you think like if you're racing a 

3213
02:31:51,561 --> 02:31:51,561
car,
you know how to drive a car,

3214
02:31:51,561 --> 02:31:51,561
right?
Yeah.

3215
02:31:51,561 --> 02:31:52,410
This is not necessarily.
He just had.

3216
02:31:52,440 --> 02:31:54,690
It could be just some rich fuckhead.
Look at this.

3217
02:31:54,750 --> 02:31:56,170
Look at this car.
Wash us.

3218
02:31:56,250 --> 02:31:57,150
Where's the volume?
Hold on,

3219
02:31:57,230 --> 02:31:57,530
stop.

3220
02:32:01,330 --> 02:32:06,330
Oh my play that again please.
It's going sideways around the corner,

3221
02:32:08,660 --> 02:32:10,560
but off the gas that anytime now

3222
02:32:12,740 --> 02:32:17,740
he didn't even turn.
No fucking moron.

3223
02:32:18,200 --> 02:32:19,400
I got this.
Look at this,

3224
02:32:19,430 --> 02:32:20,750
look at this.
It's going size.

3225
02:32:20,751 --> 02:32:22,670
Is that uh,
first of all,

3226
02:32:22,671 --> 02:32:27,671
his line sucks.
I mean he kinda goes left a little bit 

3227
02:32:27,671 --> 02:32:28,580
to go right.
Passenger racing too,

3228
02:32:28,581 --> 02:32:30,220
right?
Where you like the guys with you,

3229
02:32:30,500 --> 02:32:31,370
you think he was like,
hey,

3230
02:32:31,430 --> 02:32:33,830
hey,
look at the wheels come home.

3231
02:32:33,831 --> 02:32:35,720
I think those upside.
Meanwhile they fixed it.

3232
02:32:36,020 --> 02:32:37,730
They fixed that car and they put her 
right back on the road.

3233
02:32:37,760 --> 02:32:38,450
Really?
Yup.

3234
02:32:38,540 --> 02:32:43,540
Not even totaled because it really,
when you watch him hit the way he hit 

3235
02:32:43,540 --> 02:32:47,260
and slammed on the brakes,
he tried to kind of just fucked up the 

3236
02:32:47,260 --> 02:32:47,260
suspension.
Like,

3237
02:32:47,260 --> 02:32:47,390
watch it again,
like,

3238
02:32:47,391 --> 02:32:48,260
watch.
He hits it,

3239
02:32:49,010 --> 02:32:50,360
breaks,
boom.

3240
02:32:50,480 --> 02:32:55,480
Hits it.
But you see the wheel comes off the 

3241
02:32:55,480 --> 02:32:55,480
frame seems okay.
Yeah.

3242
02:32:55,480 --> 02:32:55,730
Boom.
Lambs,

3243
02:32:55,820 --> 02:32:58,460
little water damage.
Those cars are bulletproof.

3244
02:32:58,460 --> 02:33:01,490
They're so solid German engineering,
but it's just.

3245
02:33:01,610 --> 02:33:06,610
I mean,
you would think a guy in a fucking race 

3246
02:33:06,610 --> 02:33:06,610
would probably know how to drive a 
regular car.

3247
02:33:06,610 --> 02:33:06,910
Advanced driver.
Yeah.

3248
02:33:07,070 --> 02:33:10,280
Usually guy's a moron.
Or was for that brief moment.

3249
02:33:10,550 --> 02:33:12,500
Maybe you had a seizure,
maybe.

3250
02:33:12,560 --> 02:33:13,850
Yeah.
Maybe we were just being assholes.

3251
02:33:13,940 --> 02:33:14,960
That's true.
Yeah.

3252
02:33:15,440 --> 02:33:19,620
It had the feet feature stop working.
No.

3253
02:33:19,850 --> 02:33:23,550
Have you had to Fart?
Like break?

3254
02:33:23,590 --> 02:33:25,610
Break hold.
I'd be as friend far today.

3255
02:33:26,880 --> 02:33:31,860
Glued Griffin.
Poor bastard.

3256
02:33:31,880 --> 02:33:33,890
I'm seeing him at long time seeing him 
in a long time.

3257
02:33:34,060 --> 02:33:36,110
No.
See what store I used to.

3258
02:33:36,180 --> 02:33:38,210
I was banned from the store.
Oh.

3259
02:33:38,490 --> 02:33:39,980
Years ago.
I left the store.

3260
02:33:40,170 --> 02:33:44,540
I can't get them to go offstage.
Eddie will go on stage at nine and close

3261
02:33:44,541 --> 02:33:45,770
it out at 3:00
in the morning.

3262
02:33:45,800 --> 02:33:47,110
Not cool,
Bro.

3263
02:33:47,490 --> 02:33:49,010
Not Cool.
Ridiculous.

3264
02:33:49,050 --> 02:33:50,270
Don't we hate that?
Yeah.

3265
02:33:50,600 --> 02:33:50,980
Well it's.

3266
02:33:51,280 --> 02:33:52,820
It's weird.
I know he's on that tour.

3267
02:33:52,870 --> 02:33:55,550
That tour going on right now is like.
Yeah,

3268
02:33:55,551 --> 02:33:58,040
it's like him.
George Lopez.

3269
02:33:58,710 --> 02:34:01,820
I'm a black brown or black or brown 
tour.

3270
02:34:01,821 --> 02:34:04,550
Yeah,
they're doing like fucking huge venues.

3271
02:34:04,551 --> 02:34:05,450
Yeah.
Powerful.

3272
02:34:05,570 --> 02:34:06,830
Yeah.
Do it for him.

3273
02:34:06,860 --> 02:34:08,180
What are we doing that?
Let's do it.

3274
02:34:08,181 --> 02:34:09,080
Set it up.
It's fucking.

3275
02:34:09,081 --> 02:34:10,100
Make something happen.
Huh?

3276
02:34:10,290 --> 02:34:11,690
Huh?
Let's do it.

3277
02:34:11,720 --> 02:34:12,500
What are we doing?
What does that.

3278
02:34:12,530 --> 02:34:13,580
The Omega Man.
What's up?

3279
02:34:13,640 --> 02:34:14,250
What is it?
Oh Man.

3280
02:34:14,280 --> 02:34:15,300
Some black shit.
Oh,

3281
02:34:15,620 --> 02:34:16,880
you don't even know.
I just didn't know.

3282
02:34:16,881 --> 02:34:18,160
It's fraternity.
Careful.

3283
02:34:18,200 --> 02:34:23,200
Come on.
What if the people that are the Alphas 

3284
02:34:23,200 --> 02:34:23,200
are mad at you?
That was in the prison.

3285
02:34:23,200 --> 02:34:23,270
You were in prison?
Yeah,

3286
02:34:23,280 --> 02:34:24,120
man,
I have all the tat.

3287
02:34:24,190 --> 02:34:29,190
So would you guys be interested in 
getting at your mom's house tattoo?

3288
02:34:31,320 --> 02:34:34,750
I'm going to pass now.
I know for my son.

3289
02:34:34,780 --> 02:34:35,350
Why?
How about uh,

3290
02:34:35,351 --> 02:34:39,620
why an m and an h all together in one 
big cluster?

3291
02:34:39,621 --> 02:34:40,630
Fuck,
no.

3292
02:34:42,840 --> 02:34:45,330
I have one tattoo for the nineties and 
I,

3293
02:34:45,940 --> 02:34:47,370
I'm not that person.
I'm not good.

3294
02:34:47,530 --> 02:34:50,480
Some startup or some kid came up with a 
um,

3295
02:34:50,860 --> 02:34:55,260
a cream that instead of like laser takes
your tattoo ink completely off.

3296
02:34:55,970 --> 02:34:57,250
Really?
Apparently.

3297
02:34:57,460 --> 02:34:59,830
See if you can find that Jamie.
But apparently it works,

3298
02:35:00,070 --> 02:35:02,270
you know,
it was like shark tank or something like

3299
02:35:02,271 --> 02:35:02,830
that.
Yeah.

3300
02:35:02,831 --> 02:35:05,620
Apparently the tattoo a.
what's it called?

3301
02:35:05,621 --> 02:35:07,480
Do they invest in them?
I know very little about this.

3302
02:35:07,510 --> 02:35:08,210
Okay.
Just talking.

3303
02:35:08,240 --> 02:35:10,330
I researched it before I brought it out 
to them.

3304
02:35:10,350 --> 02:35:10,710
Well,
no,

3305
02:35:10,720 --> 02:35:11,860
that's cool.
I watched that show.

3306
02:35:11,861 --> 02:35:16,861
Sometimes I get into it,
but I heard some people talking about 

3307
02:35:16,861 --> 02:35:16,861
and they were super excited about it.
Shark tank,

3308
02:35:16,861 --> 02:35:18,910
I don't like when they over rehearse 
their pitches though,

3309
02:35:18,911 --> 02:35:20,690
like I know they're nervous because 
they're on now,

3310
02:35:22,260 --> 02:35:25,650
but we found no better way to eat jello 
and is like this.

3311
02:35:26,310 --> 02:35:31,310
He was so nervous and scared as a 
performer.

3312
02:35:33,280 --> 02:35:38,280
Empathy for them.
But some of them are amazing at their 

3313
02:35:38,280 --> 02:35:38,380
level of bullshit,
like their,

3314
02:35:38,381 --> 02:35:39,370
their pitch,
you know,

3315
02:35:39,400 --> 02:35:41,380
they'll come on and they'd be like,
well,

3316
02:35:41,381 --> 02:35:45,160
so what are your sales like?
Real strong really good numbers.

3317
02:35:45,640 --> 02:35:46,640
And then they'll throw out something 
that like,

3318
02:35:46,660 --> 02:35:48,670
you can verify that I could probably get
it to you.

3319
02:35:48,740 --> 02:35:51,340
Like they're just like making shit up,
you know?

3320
02:35:51,760 --> 02:35:54,070
Wow.
Fake it til you make it.

3321
02:35:54,071 --> 02:35:55,760
Yeah.
It's a big party going on there.

3322
02:35:55,761 --> 02:35:57,210
Like for like a lotto ticket,
you know?

3323
02:35:57,460 --> 02:35:59,170
So what have you guys written down while
you've been here?

3324
02:35:59,171 --> 02:36:01,360
Because we have your pads.
We're going to eventually take all these

3325
02:36:01,361 --> 02:36:03,130
pads and people scribble and write 
things down.

3326
02:36:03,131 --> 02:36:05,020
We're going to frame them.
Really put them up.

3327
02:36:05,050 --> 02:36:08,530
Yeah.
David chose her all Dick's show.

3328
02:36:08,620 --> 02:36:10,450
Everything was dixon come come home.

3329
02:36:10,830 --> 02:36:11,520
Hmm.
Hmm.

3330
02:36:12,250 --> 02:36:15,670
I read an interview with Matt Lauer that
when the beginning,

3331
02:36:15,671 --> 02:36:17,790
we were talking about that lay,
the white lady that.

3332
02:36:17,920 --> 02:36:20,920
Oh yeah,
that was so disappointed that she didn't

3333
02:36:20,921 --> 02:36:22,900
talk blacker.
Shouldn't talk black at all.

3334
02:36:23,350 --> 02:36:26,110
When she did get.
That would have been really funny.

3335
02:36:26,820 --> 02:36:28,470
Well,
you know what I'm saying like that would

3336
02:36:28,471 --> 02:36:33,471
have been great.
This going to be some video of her 

3337
02:36:33,471 --> 02:36:33,820
talking like that especially went back 
when she was saying that she was black.

3338
02:36:34,750 --> 02:36:39,750
She got busted.
That I don't know if that post is even 

3339
02:36:39,750 --> 02:36:39,750
real of her.
Like a facebook and she could go in with

3340
02:36:39,750 --> 02:36:41,200
the all natural look and it was all 
curled,

3341
02:36:41,530 --> 02:36:44,470
which means that she just got a perm.
She was really shit straight.

3342
02:36:44,530 --> 02:36:49,530
Yeah.
She posted like going with the all 

3343
02:36:49,530 --> 02:36:50,470
natural look like I think it's real.
They said it was a real facebook.

3344
02:36:50,471 --> 02:36:53,500
They all natural for other people or 
other people.

3345
02:36:55,840 --> 02:36:56,980
Well,
there's a lot of people.

3346
02:36:57,610 --> 02:37:02,610
It shows you how we did this.
This whole progressive movement is that 

3347
02:37:02,610 --> 02:37:05,480
a lot of people have adopted this whole 
trans racial identity thing that you.

3348
02:37:05,481 --> 02:37:10,481
You should be allowed to be trans racial
and people were saying that racism or 

3349
02:37:10,481 --> 02:37:11,890
that race,
that race is just a social construct,

3350
02:37:12,250 --> 02:37:16,420
so you should be able to be translated 
out there out of fucking horrible.

3351
02:37:18,290 --> 02:37:20,210
I think it's adorable.
I really do.

3352
02:37:22,610 --> 02:37:27,610
I never saw this coming.
I mean because what we called 

3353
02:37:27,610 --> 02:37:27,610
politically correct we were talking 
about in the nineties,

3354
02:37:27,610 --> 02:37:32,590
that ain't shit compared to this because
now people have formed their entire 

3355
02:37:32,590 --> 02:37:34,580
identities based on this type of 
thinking.

3356
02:37:35,120 --> 02:37:37,640
You know this,
this agenda,

3357
02:37:37,641 --> 02:37:42,641
this,
whatever the word would be that you 

3358
02:37:42,641 --> 02:37:43,970
would fit into the whole narrative that 
they've adopted.

3359
02:37:43,990 --> 02:37:44,380
It's,
it's,

3360
02:37:44,470 --> 02:37:49,400
it's adorable because it's really,
it's simple minds,

3361
02:37:49,570 --> 02:37:50,940
trans racial,
not onboard.

3362
02:37:51,010 --> 02:37:53,120
I am on board.
I'm in.

3363
02:37:53,430 --> 02:37:57,980
I always wanted to be Japanese either.
The funny thing is that you are,

3364
02:37:58,020 --> 02:38:00,650
all you have to do is say you are in,
you are there.

3365
02:38:00,651 --> 02:38:03,950
It is all natural because I started my 
36 years.

3366
02:38:03,980 --> 02:38:07,360
That is hilarious.
So to her credit she looks good.

3367
02:38:07,370 --> 02:38:12,020
I mean she does pass good,
but she's pretty in that picture,

3368
02:38:12,021 --> 02:38:15,410
but the picture is not so pretty.
Her 36 year.

3369
02:38:15,500 --> 02:38:18,020
So a couple of years ago.
Yeah.

3370
02:38:18,021 --> 02:38:18,900
That one on.
So pretty.

3371
02:38:20,180 --> 02:38:22,490
It's a weave.
Is she say it's a we've.

3372
02:38:23,120 --> 02:38:23,690
Oh,
she does.

3373
02:38:23,930 --> 02:38:24,980
Does she say it to?
We've.

3374
02:38:24,981 --> 02:38:26,380
Yes.
It's a we've.

3375
02:38:27,800 --> 02:38:28,670
Well,
because you are.

3376
02:38:28,671 --> 02:38:32,690
I'm hearing Tanya a grocery store or 
anywhere else I would be like,

3377
02:38:32,900 --> 02:38:34,400
it's none of your business.
Finally,

3378
02:38:34,401 --> 02:38:36,260
after brief pause,
she says it's a we've.

3379
02:38:36,470 --> 02:38:39,710
Hmm.
Kinky curls and dreadlocks come from.

3380
02:38:39,890 --> 02:38:41,720
Okay.
But that was a different look.

3381
02:38:41,750 --> 02:38:46,750
That's not that look.
That was when she had the crazy 

3382
02:38:46,750 --> 02:38:49,001
dreadlocks that a lot of skin tone.
I mean she's orange is the new black.

3383
02:38:49,070 --> 02:38:49,790
Did you see,
by the way,

3384
02:38:49,791 --> 02:38:54,791
did he got arrested?
He got arrested for swinging a 

3385
02:38:54,791 --> 02:38:57,170
Kettlebell strength and conditioning 
coach at Ucla when I heard this.

3386
02:38:57,180 --> 02:38:59,300
Don't Miss Pussy.
He's a mace.

3387
02:38:59,330 --> 02:39:01,010
You can't be.
If you're going to assault someone,

3388
02:39:01,040 --> 02:39:06,040
steal clubs or macy's or the way to go 
kettlebells and awkward thing swinging 

3389
02:39:06,040 --> 02:39:09,401
around.
He would have connected with that 

3390
02:39:09,401 --> 02:39:09,401
though.
He'd be like,

3391
02:39:09,401 --> 02:39:11,530
he'd be up on murder charges.
Especially hit the guy in the head like 

3392
02:39:11,570 --> 02:39:16,570
a watermelon.
It's attempted assault with a deadly 

3393
02:39:16,570 --> 02:39:16,850
weapon.
Charge them all terrorism.

3394
02:39:17,000 --> 02:39:18,710
Yeah,
Jesus,

3395
02:39:18,740 --> 02:39:19,310
yeah,
he's in,

3396
02:39:19,430 --> 02:39:21,170
he's probably fucked right now.
Right.

3397
02:39:21,200 --> 02:39:23,360
I mean he's out on like $50,000
bail.

3398
02:39:23,361 --> 02:39:24,680
But like I,
I think,

3399
02:39:25,160 --> 02:39:27,740
you know,
those charges could easily.

3400
02:39:28,400 --> 02:39:31,010
I've read an article so you know,
it's not like I was there,

3401
02:39:31,011 --> 02:39:36,011
I don't know firsthand account,
but it looks like a pretty serious 

3402
02:39:36,011 --> 02:39:38,981
assault charge man.
And what it was it the guy was yelling 

3403
02:39:38,981 --> 02:39:39,450
at his son,
his son apparently.

3404
02:39:40,010 --> 02:39:45,010
What's,
that's actually chicklet the Kiddos in 

3405
02:39:45,010 --> 02:39:45,010
the first star wars.
He got arrested.

3406
02:39:45,560 --> 02:39:47,240
What is that about?
It's just on this page.

3407
02:39:47,241 --> 02:39:47,950
This is.
Oh,

3408
02:39:47,990 --> 02:39:50,630
different things.
They said that,

3409
02:39:51,080 --> 02:39:54,320
that um,
did he son hasn't been there for all the

3410
02:39:54,380 --> 02:39:58,610
workouts and was like giving minimal 
effort at this strength condition.

3411
02:39:58,611 --> 02:40:01,250
How weird.
Sound seems strange.

3412
02:40:01,520 --> 02:40:06,520
So spoiled kids try harder.
I heard very motivated coach lit him up 

3413
02:40:06,520 --> 02:40:11,020
and then they were.
Then the coach was on the phone and he 

3414
02:40:11,020 --> 02:40:15,010
did,
he went into his office and the coach 

3415
02:40:15,010 --> 02:40:15,010
was like,
I'll be with you like in a second.

3416
02:40:15,010 --> 02:40:18,450
And he came in and apparently it,
it escalated there.

3417
02:40:18,451 --> 02:40:23,451
He,
he hit him is what the article I read 

3418
02:40:23,451 --> 02:40:23,520
said that he punched the strength and 
conditioning coach.

3419
02:40:23,760 --> 02:40:28,760
They finally got him out of that office 
and then I guess they were next to the 

3420
02:40:28,760 --> 02:40:32,240
weight room or something and an intern.
One of the people restraining them got a

3421
02:40:32,550 --> 02:40:37,550
few people,
got them in there and he grabbed the 

3422
02:40:37,550 --> 02:40:37,550
Kettlebell and swung it at an intern.
Whoa.

3423
02:40:37,550 --> 02:40:37,950
Yeah,
so it wasn't even that cold.

3424
02:40:37,951 --> 02:40:40,140
Who knows if that's really.
Who knows if we're just talking shit.

3425
02:40:40,141 --> 02:40:45,141
I heard John Jules came down and they 
guided his hand and they brought it to 

3426
02:40:45,141 --> 02:40:46,950
the Kettlebell and he swung for Jesus.
Do you realize what angel did it?

3427
02:40:47,430 --> 02:40:48,510
Which one?
He's right there.

3428
02:40:48,840 --> 02:40:49,680
Biggie.
Yeah.

3429
02:40:49,740 --> 02:40:50,850
Whoa,
right.

3430
02:40:50,870 --> 02:40:52,380
Biggie was on the shoulder,
right?

3431
02:40:52,381 --> 02:40:57,381
Like an angel.
What if he says that biggie picked up 

3432
02:40:57,381 --> 02:40:57,381
that kettle bell.

3433
02:40:57,381 --> 02:40:59,160
Biggest one that swung it for him.
It's a good defense,

3434
02:40:59,161 --> 02:41:00,870
right?
Fucking goof balls,

3435
02:41:01,940 --> 02:41:03,840
miss too.
If going to swing the Kettlebell,

3436
02:41:03,841 --> 02:41:04,830
hit somebody with you.
Fuck,

3437
02:41:05,190 --> 02:41:07,260
I'd stick it right up his ass.
If he missed you.

3438
02:41:07,261 --> 02:41:08,910
Fuck you.
Trying to hit me with a Kettlebell.

3439
02:41:09,750 --> 02:41:10,680
Can't stop,
won't stop.

3440
02:41:10,740 --> 02:41:11,610
Can't stop,
won't stop,

3441
02:41:11,670 --> 02:41:13,370
can't stop,
won't stop but missed.

3442
02:41:14,280 --> 02:41:15,360
Yeah.
Reality.

3443
02:41:15,630 --> 02:41:18,680
Stranger than fiction.
Can't hit no hit.

3444
02:41:19,830 --> 02:41:24,830
That's a fucking mean.
If you're swinging a Kettlebell at 

3445
02:41:24,830 --> 02:41:24,830
someone.
Oh my God.

3446
02:41:24,830 --> 02:41:26,850
Trying to really,
really fucking choose that as a weapon.

3447
02:41:26,851 --> 02:41:29,970
You give a fuck.
I couldn't even pick it up.

3448
02:41:30,150 --> 02:41:35,150
We're going to be really hard to get any
real speed when you can actually hit 

3449
02:41:35,150 --> 02:41:35,160
them.
But if they're there,

3450
02:41:35,161 --> 02:41:36,780
when you do hit them,
fuck.

3451
02:41:37,470 --> 02:41:42,470
Someone's holding them in place and then
you think about what you could even do 

3452
02:41:42,470 --> 02:41:45,710
what you could do with like,
especially one that's really actually 

3453
02:41:45,710 --> 02:41:45,710
not that heavy.

3454
02:41:45,710 --> 02:41:47,740
You know,
grabbed like a man.

3455
02:41:47,790 --> 02:41:48,900
God really?
You could.

3456
02:41:48,990 --> 02:41:51,560
You could fucking kill someone for sure.
Yeah.

3457
02:41:51,660 --> 02:41:53,010
Not much of a workout tool,
but.

3458
02:41:53,130 --> 02:41:54,090
No.
But yeah,

3459
02:41:54,091 --> 02:41:58,350
you could really hurt someone.
Just fucking shows come full circle.

3460
02:41:59,020 --> 02:42:03,740
Really.
Has guys got to you?

3461
02:42:03,990 --> 02:42:06,410
Do you guys fart in front of each other 
every day?

3462
02:42:06,411 --> 02:42:08,220
All Day.
That's all that happens.

3463
02:42:08,790 --> 02:42:13,790
Let's seems weird.
We don't make Brown in front of the 

3464
02:42:13,790 --> 02:42:15,050
brow.
We definitely don't make Brown kid.

3465
02:42:15,051 --> 02:42:17,490
My cousin was like,
when he was dating,

3466
02:42:17,491 --> 02:42:19,050
his wife were,
we were,

3467
02:42:19,100 --> 02:42:21,550
we lived together and she and I,
you know,

3468
02:42:21,690 --> 02:42:23,610
she spent the night at my place and we 
go in,

3469
02:42:23,940 --> 02:42:28,940
my cousin's sitting there in the 
bathroom shitting and his girlfriend's 

3470
02:42:28,940 --> 02:42:30,510
eating a Bagel in the bathroom.
She's like,

3471
02:42:30,511 --> 02:42:35,511
yeah,
so afterwards the fuck is wrong with 

3472
02:42:35,511 --> 02:42:36,330
you.
And he was like,

3473
02:42:36,390 --> 02:42:39,030
what?
Like I neither one of them that and he's

3474
02:42:39,031 --> 02:42:41,390
like,
I'm taking a shit no in the best part is

3475
02:42:41,430 --> 02:42:42,160
you.
And I would watch,

3476
02:42:45,070 --> 02:42:47,310
shut the door,
do a full conversation.

3477
02:42:47,940 --> 02:42:50,790
But he took like fucking baby shits,
you know,

3478
02:42:50,791 --> 02:42:53,550
he's this little guy and like there 
would be no noise.

3479
02:42:53,580 --> 02:42:57,450
I think it's just kind of a good 
introductory.

3480
02:42:57,770 --> 02:43:02,770
Yeah.
Like you didn't remember what matters 

3481
02:43:02,770 --> 02:43:02,770
though,
Babe.

3482
02:43:02,770 --> 02:43:03,270
He's still dumping.
Listen,

3483
02:43:03,330 --> 02:43:05,520
I have a five year old and she takes 
logs.

3484
02:43:05,860 --> 02:43:07,080
She drops,
shine,

3485
02:43:07,180 --> 02:43:10,380
fucking huge water bottle.
Thick logs.

3486
02:43:11,320 --> 02:43:12,250
Wait,
is that the oldest

3487
02:43:12,250 --> 02:43:14,090
or the youngest?
The youngest is five now.

3488
02:43:14,520 --> 02:43:15,760
Wow Man.
Crazy.

3489
02:43:15,761 --> 02:43:16,960
You got to come over.
See them.

3490
02:43:17,070 --> 02:43:18,860
See the little people the fucking size?
Yep.

3491
02:43:19,360 --> 02:43:23,210
Check you for weeks.
I haven't seen the movie wild man five.

3492
02:43:23,240 --> 02:43:25,040
She was like,
I haven't seen them in a minute too.

3493
02:43:25,440 --> 02:43:27,640
It's been a while.
And your oldest seven,

3494
02:43:28,340 --> 02:43:33,340
she's a crazy world making people,
making people were going to join you.

3495
02:43:35,330 --> 02:43:37,870
Get me strange.
Excited about it.

3496
02:43:37,930 --> 02:43:39,910
Very excited.
Very excited.

3497
02:43:40,850 --> 02:43:41,680
It's weird,
right?

3498
02:43:43,430 --> 02:43:44,540
Ambitious.
Yeah.

3499
02:43:44,840 --> 02:43:49,840
Yeah.
You're going to get your shit together 

3500
02:43:49,840 --> 02:43:49,840
for sure.
I'm excited.

3501
02:43:49,840 --> 02:43:50,500
I really am really,
really excited.

3502
02:43:50,590 --> 02:43:55,590
You don't have to get a new tailor.
You're going to be fucking running 

3503
02:43:55,590 --> 02:43:55,590
around like a maniac.
Drop a lot of weight.

3504
02:43:55,690 --> 02:43:58,450
Yeah.
It's crazy.

3505
02:43:58,780 --> 02:44:03,780
It's surreal to think that I'm growing a
life inside of me right now as we're 

3506
02:44:03,780 --> 02:44:05,240
talking about killing girls with cum 
loads,

3507
02:44:06,980 --> 02:44:11,980
talking about the digital footprint this
kid's going to have to your kids study,

3508
02:44:13,010 --> 02:44:13,570
dad.

3509
02:44:13,600 --> 02:44:17,170
Holy Shit.
What about when you said this dad?

3510
02:44:17,370 --> 02:44:19,270
Whoa.
We just fucking around.

3511
02:44:19,271 --> 02:44:23,400
It's called the podcast plus I was high.
Don't get high kids.

3512
02:44:23,630 --> 02:44:25,240
They'll get out.
You'll be like your dad and come up with

3513
02:44:25,241 --> 02:44:28,450
all those funny jokes.
Enjoy movies and food better.

3514
02:44:28,480 --> 02:44:30,250
Don't do that.
Your Kid's funny.

3515
02:44:30,310 --> 02:44:31,330
Are they funny?
Claris?

3516
02:44:31,370 --> 02:44:33,130
Yeah.
Both of them are really funny.

3517
02:44:33,190 --> 02:44:35,360
They're ridiculous.
We talk about that sometimes like this.

3518
02:44:35,361 --> 02:44:36,220
It could be funny.
Oh,

3519
02:44:36,221 --> 02:44:37,180
for sure.
They will.

3520
02:44:37,181 --> 02:44:38,780
They they grow up in that environment 
with.

3521
02:44:38,940 --> 02:44:40,570
Yeah.
I think there's two ways to be funny.

3522
02:44:40,600 --> 02:44:43,930
Just be suppressed someone and they 
explode when they get away from you,

3523
02:44:44,480 --> 02:44:45,970
you know,
or the opposite.

3524
02:44:45,971 --> 02:44:48,570
You encourage it all the time.
Just constantly laughs.

3525
02:44:48,610 --> 02:44:51,040
It's an environment of it.
They know how to.

3526
02:44:51,160 --> 02:44:54,310
They know how to make and they repeat 
stuff when it's funny to try it again.

3527
02:44:54,390 --> 02:44:55,600
See,
it doesn't work.

3528
02:44:55,610 --> 02:44:57,700
You keep trying to get.
You got to come up with new funny thing,

3529
02:44:57,701 --> 02:44:58,710
right?
He was like,

3530
02:44:58,720 --> 02:45:00,010
I can't think of anything.
I'm like,

3531
02:45:00,070 --> 02:45:02,760
that's how it works.
That's interesting.

3532
02:45:02,810 --> 02:45:07,810
Yeah.
There's two highly inappropriate people 

3533
02:45:07,810 --> 02:45:11,880
with boundary issues.
It's going to be weird because we're 

3534
02:45:11,880 --> 02:45:12,070
both like,
I don't have a filter.

3535
02:45:12,071 --> 02:45:12,900
You're more,
you,

3536
02:45:12,930 --> 02:45:16,570
you're capable of acting civilized,
but I fear that I'm not.

3537
02:45:16,630 --> 02:45:21,630
Your kids will.
They were bell by becoming an 

3538
02:45:21,630 --> 02:45:21,630
accountant.
That's what we talk about.

3539
02:45:23,010 --> 02:45:25,510
Like when the kid is like,
you know,

3540
02:45:26,080 --> 02:45:28,810
11 or something like having friends over
and he's like,

3541
02:45:29,290 --> 02:45:34,290
dude,
could you please not do your fucking 

3542
02:45:34,290 --> 02:45:34,290
joke around shit.
Like that's true,

3543
02:45:34,290 --> 02:45:34,690
right?
Come on.

3544
02:45:34,720 --> 02:45:37,090
God Damn it.
Dad.

3545
02:45:37,091 --> 02:45:39,910
Did you know son,
son,

3546
02:45:39,970 --> 02:45:44,970
come here in our farm now it's going to 
be so many far.

3547
02:45:45,171 --> 02:45:49,610
It's in our house and so much brown 
Brown.

3548
02:45:50,080 --> 02:45:54,190
Do you like by the time your kid becomes
like 17,

3549
02:45:54,191 --> 02:45:57,700
18 years old?
Imagine how fucking strange the world is

3550
02:45:57,701 --> 02:45:58,890
going to be there.
We can't.

3551
02:45:58,891 --> 02:46:00,940
We can't imagine.
We can't imagine it though.

3552
02:46:01,050 --> 02:46:05,710
I mean how different the world is.
I'm 39 and I look at like millennials in

3553
02:46:05,711 --> 02:46:08,980
the audience and I look at them and I 
just go like the world I grew up in,

3554
02:46:08,990 --> 02:46:10,250
I was born in 76

3555
02:46:10,580 --> 02:46:15,080
is radically different than the world.
Millennials grew up in cell phone.

3556
02:46:15,081 --> 02:46:17,870
I didn't have that until I graduated 
from college.

3557
02:46:18,290 --> 02:46:21,290
I didn't send an email until I was in 
the work force.

3558
02:46:21,360 --> 02:46:23,990
That's why your friend had a makeup 
pitstop every hour.

3559
02:46:24,290 --> 02:46:26,150
Talked to her dad,
right?

3560
02:46:26,870 --> 02:46:29,220
I'm here.
No one has been.

3561
02:46:29,250 --> 02:46:32,540
Fuck,
I need to wipe again.

3562
02:46:32,810 --> 02:46:34,210
This very leaky.
Today.

3563
02:46:34,211 --> 02:46:36,650
That girl talked about taking the bar,
how to describe it,

3564
02:46:38,690 --> 02:46:41,120
how did she describe it?
That she'd like rationalize it.

3565
02:46:41,420 --> 02:46:46,420
She knows completely rational to her the
argument because it's such a cultural 

3566
02:46:46,420 --> 02:46:47,540
thing,
at least amongst her friends.

3567
02:46:47,541 --> 02:46:52,130
That is what you did.
But from what I understand,

3568
02:46:53,810 --> 02:46:58,810
that's a great question.
And I wish I would have asked that at 

3569
02:46:58,810 --> 02:46:58,810
13.
I didn't have the wherewithal.

3570
02:46:59,260 --> 02:47:00,180
Do they?
Um,

3571
02:47:00,230 --> 02:47:01,220
did she talk about like,
oh,

3572
02:47:01,221 --> 02:47:02,860
Christina feels so good.
I should do.

3573
02:47:03,200 --> 02:47:04,600
She didn't like it.
I know.

3574
02:47:04,630 --> 02:47:07,280
She personally.
It was just a necessity.

3575
02:47:08,130 --> 02:47:10,790
It was basically like you.
That's what you gotta do?

3576
02:47:11,610 --> 02:47:12,480
Yeah.
Wow.

3577
02:47:12,530 --> 02:47:14,240
Isn't that weird?
That it doesn't feel good.

3578
02:47:14,270 --> 02:47:19,270
She doesn't like it.
But you have to do it because you like 

3579
02:47:19,270 --> 02:47:19,270
boys.
But what do you like about boys?

3580
02:47:19,270 --> 02:47:19,650
Fuck y'all.

3581
02:47:21,940 --> 02:47:24,890
I mean at least if the boys are putting 
it in your vagina and you,

3582
02:47:25,010 --> 02:47:27,530
it feels good in your vagina,
then you like sex,

3583
02:47:27,800 --> 02:47:31,070
but you don't even like the sec.
But you have to do it because what?

3584
02:47:33,080 --> 02:47:35,240
She liked the boys that were the 
attention.

3585
02:47:35,260 --> 02:47:37,190
But sexing her,
but she didn't.

3586
02:47:37,640 --> 02:47:42,640
She could only but sex.
So that was the one outlet and that's 

3587
02:47:42,640 --> 02:47:44,540
the compromise of it,
I guess to get to hang out with a boy.

3588
02:47:44,900 --> 02:47:47,750
But the first time she ever got one in 
the actual cooter she's probably like.

3589
02:47:49,120 --> 02:47:52,040
And then that guy was easier than what?

3590
02:47:54,840 --> 02:47:59,700
For a while I am pure.
Don't worry about it.

3591
02:48:00,530 --> 02:48:02,420
Oh,
what a weird thing.

3592
02:48:02,460 --> 02:48:06,810
The religious principles when it comes 
to bug fucking,

3593
02:48:06,940 --> 02:48:11,000
it's sad.
It makes me sad that she had to,

3594
02:48:11,001 --> 02:48:16,001
but sex instead of just having the sex 
she wanted was getting fucked in 

3595
02:48:16,001 --> 02:48:19,901
America.
Get buffed really sad,

3596
02:48:24,570 --> 02:48:26,450
but fuck.
While the Talibans were watching,

3597
02:48:27,210 --> 02:48:28,350
getting buck,
buck,

3598
02:48:28,730 --> 02:48:30,060
buck,
buck the right place,

3599
02:48:30,180 --> 02:48:34,640
get a fucking lawyer free.
You're free to get bud fucked or not.

3600
02:48:34,670 --> 02:48:35,110
How?
Bob?

3601
02:48:35,130 --> 02:48:37,730
That you could always become a Christian
and you can do whatever you want,

3602
02:48:38,680 --> 02:48:42,060
not really worse things and getting 
fucked in America right now,

3603
02:48:42,080 --> 02:48:44,390
there's a lot worse.
And get back to your own fucking country

3604
02:48:44,720 --> 02:48:49,720
sucks.
How about not getting butt fucked and 

3605
02:48:49,720 --> 02:48:49,720
Iran.
Persia.

3606
02:48:49,720 --> 02:48:50,940
By the way,
there is no persia.

3607
02:48:51,040 --> 02:48:53,630
Cheese,
adorable,

3608
02:48:54,380 --> 02:48:59,380
adorable.
That they'd start calling it that after 

3609
02:48:59,380 --> 02:49:01,070
the Iranian hostage crisis.
The Jimmy Carter thing is that when they

3610
02:49:01,071 --> 02:49:02,870
went back to when they started doing 
Persian,

3611
02:49:03,230 --> 02:49:05,450
because I had an Iranian girlfriend when
I was like seven,

3612
02:49:05,630 --> 02:49:07,650
eight.
And how has the bud sex

3613
02:49:08,720 --> 02:49:11,800
or too little when she was really my 
friend show you're calling my girlfriend

3614
02:49:11,801 --> 02:49:15,000
and she was my friend,
but her mother tried to stab her father.

3615
02:49:15,150 --> 02:49:18,990
She was half Iranian and half white.
Her Dad was white.

3616
02:49:19,580 --> 02:49:20,190
Well,
you know,

3617
02:49:20,191 --> 02:49:22,830
they're both white colors,
whatever.

3618
02:49:22,831 --> 02:49:27,831
He was an eastern Europe,
whatever the fuck he was United States 

3619
02:49:27,831 --> 02:49:29,070
navy,
normal white person type shit.

3620
02:49:29,310 --> 02:49:30,310
And um,
the,

3621
02:49:30,500 --> 02:49:32,400
the,
the wife tried to stab the,

3622
02:49:32,630 --> 02:49:35,010
the father while,
uh,

3623
02:49:35,100 --> 02:49:37,860
while I was friends with her and he said
this really weird,

3624
02:49:37,861 --> 02:49:42,861
crazy situation.
Like I really wish I remembered more of 

3625
02:49:42,861 --> 02:49:42,861
it,
but I really liked her.

3626
02:49:42,861 --> 02:49:43,560
She was sweet.
She was very pretty too.

3627
02:49:44,130 --> 02:49:46,140
And uh,
she was really nice little girl.

3628
02:49:46,260 --> 02:49:51,260
We're both the same age.
I think we went to school together hard 

3629
02:49:51,260 --> 02:49:54,141
for me to remember.
I was living in San Francisco at the 

3630
02:49:54,141 --> 02:49:54,141
time.
So it's probably like eight and uh,

3631
02:49:54,141 --> 02:49:56,730
there was like this big issue,
which was like my mother,

3632
02:49:57,540 --> 02:50:01,110
my father and the police came and yeah,
imagine that,

3633
02:50:01,230 --> 02:50:04,020
you know,
mother was old school from Iran.

3634
02:50:04,410 --> 02:50:08,100
She just was ready to kill a guy.
I could understand that.

3635
02:50:08,190 --> 02:50:10,960
Ready to kill a motherfucker,
whatever you'd like,

3636
02:50:11,010 --> 02:50:13,530
I'll make you feel better.
Just spread your ass hole up.

3637
02:50:13,560 --> 02:50:15,020
And she's like,
enough with that.

3638
02:50:15,021 --> 02:50:15,660
But sex.

3639
02:50:17,850 --> 02:50:20,250
But she had like gone after him.
I don't know if she,

3640
02:50:20,280 --> 02:50:23,640
I don't remember if she cut him or God,
I don't remember what happened,

3641
02:50:23,641 --> 02:50:26,970
but it was cops were involved and it was
pretty significant.

3642
02:50:26,971 --> 02:50:30,780
I think that the little girl might have 
had to stay over my house for awhile.

3643
02:50:30,990 --> 02:50:32,360
It's hard.
It's hard for me to remember.

3644
02:50:32,390 --> 02:50:37,390
She,
I spent the night over my house were 

3645
02:50:37,390 --> 02:50:39,230
cops were there.
It was a big deal though because I 

3646
02:50:39,230 --> 02:50:39,930
remember my parents being freaked out.
We were freaked out,

3647
02:50:40,230 --> 02:50:41,710
you know,
um,

3648
02:50:41,850 --> 02:50:43,580
as someone who's a,
you know,

3649
02:50:43,630 --> 02:50:48,630
with Phil Harmon,
I've experienced the actual act getting 

3650
02:50:48,630 --> 02:50:48,630
done,
you know,

3651
02:50:48,630 --> 02:50:51,450
his wife actually killed them.
When you know somebody like that is when

3652
02:50:51,451 --> 02:50:54,690
you see shit like that about people 
trying to kill people,

3653
02:50:55,290 --> 02:51:00,050
you know people that loved each other,
made a child and it got.

3654
02:51:00,110 --> 02:51:02,100
It went so far,
so far gone.

3655
02:51:02,130 --> 02:51:05,310
Someone pulled out a metal blade and 
went after somebody.

3656
02:51:05,370 --> 02:51:07,020
Tom's Dick,
or do you have an erection right now?

3657
02:51:07,110 --> 02:51:10,590
Someone in farted while they were 
getting stabbed better,

3658
02:51:12,350 --> 02:51:17,350
I'm getting.
I'm getting a little bit of weight in 

3659
02:51:17,350 --> 02:51:17,750
there now.
This little thing,

3660
02:51:17,770 --> 02:51:19,340
a little blood flow.
Keep talking.

3661
02:51:20,090 --> 02:51:25,090
She cried and he listened.
He watches all exclusively wife murder 

3662
02:51:27,141 --> 02:51:29,370
shows on the dvr.
It's like,

3663
02:51:29,470 --> 02:51:30,230
it's like,
what are you doing?

3664
02:51:30,250 --> 02:51:31,610
Crime?
You're doing research?

3665
02:51:31,630 --> 02:51:34,970
Yes.
Forty eight wife murdered.

3666
02:51:35,680 --> 02:51:38,970
He enjoys the wife.
Of course.

3667
02:51:39,500 --> 02:51:42,080
I watched a lot of crimes or alleged 
crimes,

3668
02:51:42,570 --> 02:51:44,930
crime stuff I've always liked.
I liked the stories,

3669
02:51:44,931 --> 02:51:45,580
you know,
I like it.

3670
02:51:46,630 --> 02:51:48,620
I'm so excited about telling him the 
stories.

3671
02:51:48,621 --> 02:51:53,621
I mean,
usually I've always loved like thriller 

3672
02:51:53,621 --> 02:51:53,621
films.
You know what I liked.

3673
02:51:53,621 --> 02:51:56,480
I just liked that genre of like 
something happens and then someone's got

3674
02:51:56,481 --> 02:51:58,010
to solve the case of where I was like 
that.

3675
02:51:58,011 --> 02:52:01,730
So I look at it as just a story.
It's a crime story,

3676
02:52:01,731 --> 02:52:03,080
which I've always like.
She's like,

3677
02:52:03,260 --> 02:52:05,760
oh,
I can check it off to the like,

3678
02:52:06,380 --> 02:52:08,590
well,
because it's a lot like you got.

3679
02:52:08,800 --> 02:52:10,130
I'm fascinated by it.
No,

3680
02:52:10,140 --> 02:52:11,590
no.
You've got most evil.

3681
02:52:12,010 --> 02:52:14,110
That was the most evil.
What does that.

3682
02:52:14,200 --> 02:52:19,200
Most evil has a forensic psychologist 
who has interviewed the worst of the 

3683
02:52:19,271 --> 02:52:20,290
worst,
uh,

3684
02:52:20,320 --> 02:52:21,540
specializes in like,
you know,

3685
02:52:21,700 --> 02:52:26,700
serial killers.
And they basically have a scale of from 

3686
02:52:26,700 --> 02:52:30,661
one to 22 that ranks how evil a person 
is based on their acts.

3687
02:52:31,210 --> 02:52:36,210
And so what's 22?
Twenty two is a torture murderer.

3688
02:52:36,820 --> 02:52:38,500
Who?
Btk Killer?

3689
02:52:38,530 --> 02:52:39,640
He's 22.
Yeah.

3690
02:52:39,730 --> 02:52:41,210
Ask him mother killers.
He,

3691
02:52:41,240 --> 02:52:43,830
he knows the game.
Like baseball players,

3692
02:52:43,850 --> 02:52:46,800
you cards mid lamps.
I don't know.

3693
02:52:46,810 --> 02:52:51,810
Yeah,
I don't know because I haven't seen him 

3694
02:52:51,810 --> 02:52:51,810
profiled on the,
on the episode.

3695
02:52:51,810 --> 02:52:52,060
But you know,
when you,

3696
02:52:52,120 --> 02:52:55,020
when they get off on the torture aspect,
you know,

3697
02:52:55,030 --> 02:52:57,460
especially if it's like sexually getting
off on that,

3698
02:52:57,780 --> 02:53:00,040
that thrilled.
They're usually the highest ranking one.

3699
02:53:00,070 --> 02:53:03,700
So all the.
Everybody who tortures is pretty,

3700
02:53:03,940 --> 02:53:05,970
pretty nice.

3701
02:53:06,010 --> 02:53:08,140
Gentlemen,
who are psychopathic,

3702
02:53:08,141 --> 02:53:08,920
torture,
murderers,

3703
02:53:09,730 --> 02:53:11,920
murderers,
you think they judge 22 people.

3704
02:53:12,760 --> 02:53:14,830
Which guy is dead?
Mom.

3705
02:53:15,120 --> 02:53:15,820
Hello?
Oh,

3706
02:53:15,821 --> 02:53:16,900
Henry Lee.
Lucas.

3707
02:53:17,160 --> 02:53:19,150
Yeah.
He lied a lot about things.

3708
02:53:19,151 --> 02:53:21,160
So he did and they didn't know,
but they,

3709
02:53:21,520 --> 02:53:25,850
I mean they at least in the profile said
that like the best.

3710
02:53:27,430 --> 02:53:30,560
I'm the best was like,
I think it was,

3711
02:53:30,620 --> 02:53:35,080
it was lucas or another guy who they,
he always killed and then had sex.

3712
02:53:35,380 --> 02:53:38,110
So they would go like a,
hey,

3713
02:53:38,111 --> 02:53:43,111
why did you.
He said the cops who interviewed him at 

3714
02:53:43,111 --> 02:53:43,111
the time was now talking about it,
you know,

3715
02:53:43,111 --> 02:53:45,760
I asked him why he killed this girl and 
he goes,

3716
02:53:45,761 --> 02:53:47,140
you know,
to have sex with her.

3717
02:53:47,530 --> 02:53:49,470
And then by like the fifth time I would 
add,

3718
02:53:49,490 --> 02:53:52,520
I would say like,
so why did you kill this other girl,

3719
02:53:52,521 --> 02:53:54,640
Sharon?
And that the guy was like,

3720
02:53:56,020 --> 02:53:57,760
I said,
to have sex with it.

3721
02:53:57,760 --> 02:54:02,250
Like he was annoyed that they kept 
asking him that.

3722
02:54:02,290 --> 02:54:02,960
Uh,
yeah,

3723
02:54:02,980 --> 02:54:04,990
dude,
that's why I kill them.

3724
02:54:05,360 --> 02:54:06,760
Jesus,
what is your problem?

3725
02:54:07,420 --> 02:54:08,620
Yeah,
I don't like those shows.

3726
02:54:08,920 --> 02:54:09,430
You know,
why?

3727
02:54:09,431 --> 02:54:12,490
Because I think I get it.
I think I get it,

3728
02:54:12,540 --> 02:54:17,540
you know,
like I think I'm pretty aware I've seen 

3729
02:54:17,540 --> 02:54:17,540
enough of those and I've seen enough 
documentaries.

3730
02:54:17,540 --> 02:54:19,150
I know people can be really fucked up 
part,

3731
02:54:19,300 --> 02:54:24,300
but I don't like to concentrate all that
all the time because then I'll just be 

3732
02:54:24,300 --> 02:54:24,610
fucking paranoid and weirded out and 
ready to go to war.

3733
02:54:24,611 --> 02:54:25,630
Everywhere I go.
I,

3734
02:54:25,690 --> 02:54:29,830
I don't watch it all the time,
but I do watch it when I'm jerking off.

3735
02:54:30,460 --> 02:54:32,410
Everyone's got to come or that's my 
whole thing.

3736
02:54:35,250 --> 02:54:36,430
We're at a time.
All right.

3737
02:54:36,610 --> 02:54:38,410
We did three hours.
Holy Shit.

3738
02:54:39,100 --> 02:54:43,210
I have another podcast to holy shit 
doing Jay Hawks podcast tonight.

3739
02:54:43,270 --> 02:54:43,930
Oh,
cool.

3740
02:54:44,020 --> 02:54:46,690
Tell him I said what's up?
You know him peripherally.

3741
02:54:46,810 --> 02:54:48,030
I don't know him personally.
Yeah,

3742
02:54:48,070 --> 02:54:50,740
I know him through the onnit folks.
Your mom's house.

3743
02:54:50,830 --> 02:54:52,720
That's the podcast.
Get it on itunes.

3744
02:54:52,721 --> 02:54:57,120

10th at the MGM Grand Garden with the,

at the coffee theater with Tony 
Hinchcliffe.

3749
02:55:14,510 --> 02:55:18,920
We're in Pony bitches.
Apparently the Aldo fight is canceled.

3750
02:55:18,921 --> 02:55:20,930
Ladies and gentlemen,
I hate to be the bringer of bad news,

3751
02:55:21,380 --> 02:55:23,930
although broke his rib today.
That's it.

3752
02:55:24,470 --> 02:55:25,580
That's a wrap.
Not Good.

3753
02:55:25,790 --> 02:55:30,790
Alright friends,

Thank you.

3756
02:55:32,900 --> 02:55:33,380
Thank you.

3757
02:55:34,710 --> 02:55:35,160
Does that mean.
