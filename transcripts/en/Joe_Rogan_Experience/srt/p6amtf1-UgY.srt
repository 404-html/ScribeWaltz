00:00:03,950 --> 00:00:08,570
The Joe Rogan experience podcast by 
night,

2
00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:15,110
Tony Hinchcliffe hiding right now in the
basement from Cris Cyborg.

3
00:00:15,170 --> 00:00:16,040
This just in.

4
00:00:16,110 --> 00:00:16,980
Ha Ha.

5
00:00:17,050 --> 00:00:20,710
President trump has not responded to any
of Tony's calls.

6
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:25,030
He's ignored all of his tweets.
Tony does not know what to do.

7
00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:27,220
Brian Red Band is not helping.

8
00:00:27,330 --> 00:00:30,300
I'm trying to find the sound effect for 
breaking news.

9
00:00:30,330 --> 00:00:35,300
No,
we don't need to ask sidebar inside.

10
00:00:35,430 --> 00:00:39,070
Giant icons on your phone.
Do you switch the size of your icons?

11
00:00:39,100 --> 00:00:41,010
Canada?
I have regular exercise.

12
00:00:41,610 --> 00:00:43,530
That's what are those sounds?
Oh,

13
00:00:43,531 --> 00:00:44,790
that's why I was confused.
I was like,

14
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:47,180
well,
I thought there was a.

15
00:00:47,370 --> 00:00:50,220
like you had some hack to your phone.
I also hadn't wanted that.

16
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:52,320
That's how stupid people are.
I see.

17
00:00:52,330 --> 00:00:54,270
Like,
like a different size icon of go.

18
00:00:54,330 --> 00:00:56,420
Oh,
I hear.

19
00:00:58,530 --> 00:01:02,910
I just bought a hacked.
A firestick off Ebay or Amazon one.

20
00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:03,773
Yeah.
It's one of those things where you put 

21
00:01:04,441 --> 00:01:06,480
it in your.
You have everything like movies that are

22
00:01:06,481 --> 00:01:09,120
in the movie theaters.
You have every single TV show,

23
00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:10,490
paper views.
Yeah.

24
00:01:10,940 --> 00:01:13,410
You get and yeah,
all everything you get.

25
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:14,161
Well,
you know what?

26
00:01:14,161 --> 00:01:17,190
Those little,
those little Amazon things or the little

27
00:01:17,191 --> 00:01:19,140
google one,
those little google sticks,

28
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:20,333
you stick them in a Usb port on your 
computer or on your tv and you can 

29
00:01:25,111 --> 00:01:28,710
stream something from your computer 
right to that and it plays on the TV.

30
00:01:28,830 --> 00:01:31,830
How in the fuck does that work?
Because like your apple TV.

31
00:01:32,070 --> 00:01:33,700
I have apple TV.
It's like a,

32
00:01:33,750 --> 00:01:36,400
like a big Mac,
big Mac size,

33
00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:38,880
but this is like a usb stick.

34
00:01:38,890 --> 00:01:42,010
It's got a little processor.
The same like in the cell phone in it.

35
00:01:42,190 --> 00:01:43,023
That's amazing.
Yeah.

36
00:01:43,420 --> 00:01:44,830
I don't know how any of that stuff 
works.

37
00:01:44,831 --> 00:01:46,690
I can barely get the TV I have to work.

38
00:01:46,780 --> 00:01:47,613
It's because I was watching some fight 
to the Dan espn three and I don't know 

39
00:01:49,691 --> 00:01:53,860
if you knew this,
but espn three is not really a station.

40
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:55,570
It's a,
it's a website.

41
00:01:56,700 --> 00:01:57,940
Yeah.
There's espn one,

42
00:01:57,941 --> 00:01:59,680
espn two.
Those are both on tv,

43
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:04,800
but espn three is like a website,
so they had glory fights on espn three.

44
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:07,210
We've got an issue here.
Jamie's in here.

45
00:02:07,211 --> 00:02:09,340
There must be an issue.
Um,

46
00:02:09,910 --> 00:02:10,743
espn three.
I had to watch the fights on espn three 

47
00:02:13,121 --> 00:02:13,954
because they were on UFC fight pass had 
glory on up until this one fight and 

48
00:02:18,221 --> 00:02:21,070
then from that one fight on,
it was all on espn three,

49
00:02:21,460 --> 00:02:23,590
so I had it on my laptop and then I 
said,

50
00:02:23,591 --> 00:02:24,101
well,
oh,

51
00:02:24,101 --> 00:02:26,470
I don't have a fucking apple laptop 
anymore.

52
00:02:26,620 --> 00:02:29,320
Now I can't shoot it directly to the 
apple TV,

53
00:02:29,470 --> 00:02:32,200
and then I found out all you need is one
of those little drives.

54
00:02:32,350 --> 00:02:34,800
You stick that soccer in your TV.
Are you sure?

55
00:02:34,810 --> 00:02:36,160
I could,
yeah.

56
00:02:37,010 --> 00:02:37,843
That's how that one.

57
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:40,110
It works.
A little USB drive and then you could do

58
00:02:40,111 --> 00:02:40,944
it right from your phone to your TV.
I just bought an antenna the other day 

59
00:02:44,250 --> 00:02:46,890
just to see like what local channels I 
can get.

60
00:02:46,950 --> 00:02:47,783
Holy Shit,
you're a signal 100 and well I got a 

61
00:02:50,820 --> 00:02:51,653
hundred and 12 channels.
They're all Mexican and have all the 

62
00:02:53,731 --> 00:02:54,564
white people.
It's just distress signals like the 

63
00:02:55,681 --> 00:02:57,090
first episode of fear of the water

64
00:02:57,090 --> 00:02:58,170
walking dead.
They're like,

65
00:02:58,171 --> 00:02:59,350
I think I hear something

66
00:03:04,410 --> 00:03:05,290
weird.
Gunshot.

67
00:03:05,890 --> 00:03:10,180
There's one channel that just plays like
Johnny Carson in like old shows from the

68
00:03:10,180 --> 00:03:10,361
eighties.
Oh,

69
00:03:10,361 --> 00:03:11,140
good call.

70
00:03:11,140 --> 00:03:12,010
And then there's just like,
yeah,

71
00:03:12,011 --> 00:03:14,350
there's Russian Mexican,
Korean,

72
00:03:14,420 --> 00:03:15,800
but it is weird just watching

73
00:03:15,850 --> 00:03:16,683
like all these free channels that they.
Well that was one of the things with 

74
00:03:18,671 --> 00:03:19,504
radio,
one of the things that happened with 

75
00:03:20,231 --> 00:03:24,070
radio is in La in particular,
they would close down,

76
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:26,350
like when they closed down that FM talk 
station,

77
00:03:26,351 --> 00:03:27,184
there's an FM talk station and they 
closed it down and then a Mexican 

78
00:03:30,671 --> 00:03:34,540
station popped up.
I think what was another talk show?

79
00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:38,540
Pretty much every FM station in La is a 
very Mexicans.

80
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:41,750
There's a lot of Mexican,
like morning radio shows.

81
00:03:42,420 --> 00:03:43,253
They all sound the same.
There's always some big Mexican guy in 

82
00:03:45,361 --> 00:03:50,361
some like little tiny guy.
It's always like to sit in the woods.

83
00:03:54,450 --> 00:03:56,010
You sound Japanese.
That's terrible.

84
00:03:56,011 --> 00:03:56,940
Yeah,
that's a terrible.

85
00:03:56,980 --> 00:03:57,813
That was an Asian accent.
Definitely not a worst racist Super 

86
00:04:02,070 --> 00:04:05,310
Mexican radio station.
Worst Mexican of all time,

87
00:04:08,990 --> 00:04:11,180
but when I would pass by these bus 
stops,

88
00:04:11,210 --> 00:04:14,030
like all over La,
you'd see these billboards that were for

89
00:04:14,031 --> 00:04:15,740
these stations that you never gonna to 
listen to.

90
00:04:15,980 --> 00:04:16,813
You know,
like this one neighborhood that my ex 

91
00:04:19,161 --> 00:04:20,770
gardener,
I had an ex gardener.

92
00:04:20,771 --> 00:04:23,750
He used to fight chickens who was a.
It was a funny dude,

93
00:04:23,751 --> 00:04:24,584
man.
He came over here a couple times from 

94
00:04:25,371 --> 00:04:27,290
Mexico.
He snuck over here,

95
00:04:27,410 --> 00:04:30,600
worked over in America and it's not back
and then snow pack again.

96
00:04:30,860 --> 00:04:31,671
Wow.
What do you mean?

97
00:04:31,671 --> 00:04:34,260
He fought chicken.
He used to have chicken fights.

98
00:04:35,750 --> 00:04:39,590
He was really not really in terms of.
He would go,

99
00:04:39,890 --> 00:04:40,723
he would go,
but the other people would actually 

100
00:04:42,410 --> 00:04:43,243
fight the chickens and it was like this 
thing where all the men in this 

101
00:04:46,251 --> 00:04:49,010
community would go and they all had 
these roosters.

102
00:04:49,100 --> 00:04:49,933
I mean this,
we went to this guy's place and went to 

103
00:04:50,901 --> 00:04:54,160
check out his backyard and he had,
I don't know,

104
00:04:54,220 --> 00:04:56,570
a hundred rooster cages and I'm not 
bullshitting.

105
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:59,810
They were fucking stacked on top of each
other and then they had an arena.

106
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:00,793
You'd go into the arena.
It was like a little barn and then it's 

107
00:05:02,710 --> 00:05:03,543
like a little sunken in area that they 
had dug out and put like a little fence 

108
00:05:05,931 --> 00:05:06,764
around and that's where they would check
the chickens in and so they'd have to 

109
00:05:08,841 --> 00:05:12,140
guys and they would handle the chickens 
and they put spurs on the chickens.

110
00:05:12,290 --> 00:05:14,000
So it's not just the chickens fight each
other,

111
00:05:14,150 --> 00:05:16,520
but they put little razor blades on 
their feet.

112
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:17,600
Wow.
Yeah.

113
00:05:17,660 --> 00:05:20,900
And then they bet on who wins the fight 
and then when they,

114
00:05:20,901 --> 00:05:25,010
when like when you know that either one,
both chickens are fucked.

115
00:05:25,070 --> 00:05:25,903
Like they're essentially dead.
Like maybe if you're lucky your chicken 

116
00:05:28,011 --> 00:05:28,844
doesn't get totally.

117
00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:32,850
Are there chicken commentators,
someone like and here we crow,

118
00:05:33,270 --> 00:05:34,650
something like that.
You know what I mean?

119
00:05:35,850 --> 00:05:39,100
Fuck.
And here we can't help yourself grow.

120
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:41,850
You can't help yourself.
You're terrible bird fighting.

121
00:05:42,310 --> 00:05:43,143
Yeah.
But it's apparently a huge thing in the 

122
00:05:44,141 --> 00:05:44,974
Mexican community,
but it's interesting is like you 

123
00:05:46,631 --> 00:05:48,670
remember when Michael Vick gotten that 
big,

124
00:05:49,060 --> 00:05:49,893
horrible situation when they found out 
that he was killing dogs and he had dog 

125
00:05:52,811 --> 00:05:55,090
fights and you know,
this terrible thing.

126
00:05:55,091 --> 00:05:55,924
He was executing dogs.
That shit is happening all throughout 

127
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:00,673
the south every day.
It's a huge part of their culture by 

128
00:06:03,380 --> 00:06:05,690
animal fights,
like dog fights,

129
00:06:05,930 --> 00:06:06,763
but much more so chicken fights in 
chicken fights is a weird one where you 

130
00:06:10,011 --> 00:06:12,380
can kind of okay with it.
You know,

131
00:06:12,740 --> 00:06:13,573
like people do.
People have a hierarchy of animals that 

132
00:06:15,831 --> 00:06:19,280
they give a shit whether or not they're 
having a bad life and chickens are super

133
00:06:19,281 --> 00:06:20,240
low on that scale.

134
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:21,913
Weird that the black people have dog 
fights and the Mexicans have chicken 

135
00:06:25,161 --> 00:06:25,994
fights.
You would think the black people would 

136
00:06:26,901 --> 00:06:29,420
have chicken sites because then they 
could just have dinner afterwards.

137
00:06:29,421 --> 00:06:30,560
You know what I mean?
Their favorite.

138
00:06:30,710 --> 00:06:32,000
Well,
the Mexicans eat chickens too.

139
00:06:32,001 --> 00:06:34,630
Dude.
I don't know if say racist bitch,

140
00:06:34,910 --> 00:06:38,630
but the mind makes a Ginsey to dogs or 
Mexicans eat Sushi.

141
00:06:41,140 --> 00:06:41,973
Sushi served on a Samurai or my,
my ex girlfriend who used to live like 

142
00:06:45,421 --> 00:06:46,254
in like the ghetto part of Los Angeles 
and it was always so weird at like six 

143
00:06:49,661 --> 00:06:52,950
in the morning.
How many are you hurt?

144
00:06:52,970 --> 00:06:57,340
Like it was like a lot like crazy.
They just get used to it.

145
00:06:57,341 --> 00:06:59,590
Yeah,
it becomes like norm for the community,

146
00:06:59,591 --> 00:07:00,424
right,
for someone to have a fucking rooster 

147
00:07:01,871 --> 00:07:02,704
and we were tripping our balls off in 
Joshua tree one night and it was like 

148
00:07:05,830 --> 00:07:07,360
three or 4:00
AM.

149
00:07:07,361 --> 00:07:08,194
The Sun was not out at all and there was
one rooster that in the middle of the 

150
00:07:11,801 --> 00:07:12,634
night was like,

151
00:07:14,750 --> 00:07:15,583
we were always at their big group of 
Comedians and us and we started fucking 

152
00:07:19,100 --> 00:07:19,933
dying riffing about this like,
you know how out of control this 

153
00:07:23,241 --> 00:07:24,074
chicken's life is where you know,
he's such an idiot that he's boxing in 

154
00:07:27,681 --> 00:07:29,270
the middle of the night.
All the other chickens are like,

155
00:07:29,271 --> 00:07:30,104
there,
you can look who's blowing his load 

156
00:07:30,651 --> 00:07:31,484
early over here.
We're all on mushrooms is dying in this 

157
00:07:34,011 --> 00:07:34,844
premature ejaculating basically chicken 
that was below lined and it was just 

158
00:07:39,010 --> 00:07:40,640
like,
didn't want anybody to know.

159
00:07:40,710 --> 00:07:43,340
So maybe it's clocks off.
He took a nap earlier in the day.

160
00:07:43,370 --> 00:07:44,890
Who just jumped the gun?
Yeah,

161
00:07:44,990 --> 00:07:48,620
he'd be the guy who jumps the gun and 
felt way to refresh or mainly he felt

162
00:07:48,660 --> 00:07:50,750
that you guys were on mushrooms and he's
like,

163
00:07:50,850 --> 00:07:53,640
he got there.
This is.

164
00:07:53,810 --> 00:07:57,050
These people are crazy,
or we're on mushrooms and like,

165
00:07:57,051 --> 00:07:58,550
this'll be hilarious.
Oh,

166
00:07:58,551 --> 00:07:59,990
they'll love this.
Watch this.

167
00:07:59,991 --> 00:08:01,100
Three in the morning bomb.

168
00:08:02,290 --> 00:08:03,123
Yeah.
Maybe your very presence or maybe you 

169
00:08:04,221 --> 00:08:06,370
guys are loud and you woke him up.
Probably.

170
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:09,290
We were laughing a lot.
That's probably what it is.

171
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:10,700
It's fun.
Public are pissed.

172
00:08:10,790 --> 00:08:12,650
It's probably a dog barking.
Right?

173
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:15,650
It's probably like a bunch of reasons 
why a chicken does that.

174
00:08:16,010 --> 00:08:16,843
Not just because they wake up,
but also maybe you could fuck you shut 

175
00:08:20,301 --> 00:08:23,630
up trying to sleep over here.
It's not bad enough.

176
00:08:23,631 --> 00:08:26,570
I sleep with my feet on a stick.
Do they?

177
00:08:26,630 --> 00:08:29,370
Yeah.
They purchased so they sleep.

178
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:30,313
They climb up.
We have these areas in my chicken coop 

179
00:08:32,340 --> 00:08:33,173
where they climb up and they put their 
feet down and we have other areas where 

180
00:08:35,571 --> 00:08:36,404
they could go into a little chicken 
house and they could like go inside and 

181
00:08:40,221 --> 00:08:41,660
there's like a little roof on the 
chicken house.

182
00:08:41,661 --> 00:08:43,910
They fucking never use it.
They don't use that.

183
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:44,773
They don't want to sit down.
They want to like have their feet on 

184
00:08:46,881 --> 00:08:48,860
something.
You'd like to grab on something and hang

185
00:08:48,861 --> 00:08:50,480
on to.
Weird,

186
00:08:50,570 --> 00:08:53,060
so because they're used to purchasing 
like in the wild,

187
00:08:53,270 --> 00:08:57,390
they're their body's designed.
We think it as our to with my hands,

188
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:01,110
I'd be so fucking tired,
but their hands are so different.

189
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:04,540
Like their feet are designed for that.
Like it doesn't make them tired.

190
00:09:04,541 --> 00:09:07,350
That's an evolutionary advantage.
They can live in trees.

191
00:09:07,410 --> 00:09:09,180
How many chickens do you have?
Twenty three.

192
00:09:09,870 --> 00:09:11,760
Wow.
I didn't know you had that many.

193
00:09:12,090 --> 00:09:14,640
Have a gang of chickens.
Fresh eggs everyday.

194
00:09:14,670 --> 00:09:17,550
How many eggs is 23 a day?
Depends on the time of year.

195
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:18,930
Like this time of year they're starting 
to,

196
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:19,793
they're,
they're making a lot of eggs because 

197
00:09:20,671 --> 00:09:23,600
it's cold out and it's been raining.
And when,

198
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:28,700
when there's less sunlight,
they make more eggs to dethrone a lot of

199
00:09:29,330 --> 00:09:30,480
eggs or do you just.

200
00:09:30,490 --> 00:09:31,131
No,
no.

201
00:09:31,131 --> 00:09:32,200
Give them away.
Give them away.

202
00:09:33,270 --> 00:09:35,000
But I eat a lot of them.
You know,

203
00:09:35,010 --> 00:09:37,800
if there's um,
if there's 23 of them,

204
00:09:37,801 --> 00:09:40,830
they might make 10 eggs a day and I 
probably five of those.

205
00:09:41,110 --> 00:09:42,360
Maybe six.
That's great.

206
00:09:42,570 --> 00:09:43,650
Yeah.
I eat a lot of eggs.

207
00:09:43,830 --> 00:09:44,663
Everybody eats eggs.
We eat eggs and eggs are not bad for 

208
00:09:46,741 --> 00:09:49,470
you.
That's a fucking long standing myth that

209
00:09:49,471 --> 00:09:53,790
someone concocted in the 19 fifties and 
there was a New York Times article about

210
00:09:53,791 --> 00:09:55,290
it if you're really interested,
is terrible.

211
00:09:55,620 --> 00:09:56,453
But um,
the sugar companies for not that much 

212
00:09:59,341 --> 00:10:02,100
money for what's like in American 
dollars today,

213
00:10:02,101 --> 00:10:06,090
like $50,000,
they paid off a bunch of scientists to a

214
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:07,073
fake these reports and write reports 
saying that saturated fat was causing 

215
00:10:12,061 --> 00:10:14,730
people to have heart disease and get 
overweight.

216
00:10:14,731 --> 00:10:17,010
And when it was really sugar.
What about cholesterol?

217
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:17,993
It's not bad for you.

218
00:10:18,060 --> 00:10:19,740
Not only cholesterol,
not bad for you.

219
00:10:19,741 --> 00:10:20,574
It depends on what kind of cholesterol.
There's certain types of cholesterol 

220
00:10:22,471 --> 00:10:24,840
that people have genetic propensities 
for the not good,

221
00:10:25,230 --> 00:10:29,250
but there's ldl cholesterol and then 
there's actually like different sizes of

222
00:10:29,251 --> 00:10:31,080
different ldl cholesterol.
Cholesterol is,

223
00:10:31,081 --> 00:10:33,700
and some of it's actually good for you 
and some of it's not good for you.

224
00:10:33,701 --> 00:10:37,320
And there's hdl cholesterol,
but dietary cholesterol,

225
00:10:37,321 --> 00:10:40,200
like eating dietary cholesterol doesn't 
move.

226
00:10:40,260 --> 00:10:43,230
It doesn't move.
The blood lipids doesn't change.

227
00:10:43,290 --> 00:10:45,030
That's not what changes your 
cholesterol.

228
00:10:45,420 --> 00:10:50,220
It's like sedentary lifestyle and 
Saturate and sugar and processed foods.

229
00:10:50,250 --> 00:10:54,510
Those things elevate cholesterol more 
than eating things with cholesterol.

230
00:10:54,511 --> 00:10:56,820
It's very strange.
And then saturated fat.

231
00:10:56,821 --> 00:10:58,950
We all grew up thinking saturated fat 
was bad.

232
00:10:59,220 --> 00:11:01,170
That's why you have margarine,
right?

233
00:11:01,420 --> 00:11:03,420
Margarine is fucking illegal.
Now,

234
00:11:03,630 --> 00:11:04,750
do you know that?
You know,

235
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:09,060
trans fats are illegal now.
Do you know trans fats in the next three

236
00:11:09,061 --> 00:11:09,390
years?

237
00:11:09,390 --> 00:11:10,223
They have to remove them from food.
They have three more years to take them 

238
00:11:12,841 --> 00:11:13,674
out of food.
They gave him like a grace period of 

239
00:11:14,641 --> 00:11:15,474
three years.
So these companies can shift their 

240
00:11:16,681 --> 00:11:18,930
manufacturing.
What's that?

241
00:11:18,931 --> 00:11:22,500
Has Trans fats that we all ships a lot 
of like Doritos and shit.

242
00:11:22,501 --> 00:11:23,850
I don't have to read those,
but Fritos,

243
00:11:23,930 --> 00:11:26,250
say some shit with trans fats in it.
Yeah,

244
00:11:26,251 --> 00:11:28,230
so those are going to start tasting 
different soon.

245
00:11:28,530 --> 00:11:31,020
Probably don't taste as good.
Well then it might taste better.

246
00:11:31,021 --> 00:11:31,854
Honestly.
The thing is that people thought that 

247
00:11:32,971 --> 00:11:34,900
like margarine was good for you,
Marjorie,

248
00:11:34,910 --> 00:11:37,560
and is fucking terrible for you.
Yeah.

249
00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:41,820
Unsaturated fat is bad for you.
Saturated fat is good for you.

250
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,180
That's how fucking stupid we are.
Our whole lives,

251
00:11:45,181 --> 00:11:46,014
we grew up with shitty information and a
lot of it is because scientists were 

252
00:11:49,621 --> 00:11:50,454
paid off by the sugar company because 
the whole New York Times article about 

253
00:11:52,921 --> 00:11:54,880
it stunning.
You read it and you go,

254
00:11:54,881 --> 00:11:55,714
oh my God,
this is like responsible for who knows 

255
00:11:57,491 --> 00:11:58,324
how many millions of people making poor 
dietary choices and perhaps ruining the 

256
00:12:01,811 --> 00:12:04,900
quality of their life,
ruining the amount of energy they have,

257
00:12:04,990 --> 00:12:05,823
ruining the amount of inspiration they 
would have because their body was 

258
00:12:07,601 --> 00:12:10,480
fucking with them,
causing all sorts of premature death and

259
00:12:10,481 --> 00:12:15,481
diseases and it's not an exaggeration.
This is like a subject that is been like

260
00:12:15,581 --> 00:12:18,430
knowing at me for years now.
It's a crazy,

261
00:12:18,431 --> 00:12:19,390
crazy subject.

262
00:12:19,660 --> 00:12:21,930
Yeah.
I've sort of been talking about lately a

263
00:12:21,931 --> 00:12:24,190
graze upon it in my standup about how 
like,

264
00:12:24,191 --> 00:12:25,080
uh,
you know,

265
00:12:25,130 --> 00:12:28,510
fats,
something that you need and carbs,

266
00:12:28,570 --> 00:12:32,050
which is what makes you fat is something
that you don't need,

267
00:12:32,110 --> 00:12:34,660
but we call fat people fat and that's 
insulting.

268
00:12:34,661 --> 00:12:37,120
That's why I don't call fat people fat.
I call them carbs.

269
00:12:39,670 --> 00:12:41,650
Carbs aren't even necessarily bad for 
you.

270
00:12:41,770 --> 00:12:45,340
It's sugar.
Sugar's what's bad for you and the issue

271
00:12:45,341 --> 00:12:49,420
isn't carbs because carbs with fiber,
like some carbs like Zucchini bread,

272
00:12:49,690 --> 00:12:51,710
it's not bad for you and it's just 
amazing though,

273
00:12:51,711 --> 00:12:53,320
like the marketing of it though,
you're right,

274
00:12:53,321 --> 00:12:54,154
because it's like you're taught that 
sugary sweet and sugar is good and give 

275
00:12:57,041 --> 00:12:59,410
your kids candy on Halloween and sugar,
sugar,

276
00:12:59,411 --> 00:13:00,330
sugar,
and then fat.

277
00:13:00,430 --> 00:13:02,590
We call fat people fat.
That's the part.

278
00:13:02,591 --> 00:13:04,500
That's weird.
What's weird is

279
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:05,433
if you see those photos that you saw a 
long time ago from like the 19 twenties 

280
00:13:10,091 --> 00:13:12,970
in the 19 thirties,
you don't see anyone fat.

281
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:15,970
You see these people walking around and 
everyone looks lender.

282
00:13:16,340 --> 00:13:19,340
I mean it's super rare when you see like
a Jackie gleason,

283
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:21,960
Karen Sweden to whenever we're in 
Sweden.

284
00:13:22,060 --> 00:13:24,180
Yeah.
Even the pregnant women were skinny.

285
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:25,273
Yeah.
It's because America has let these 

286
00:13:26,691 --> 00:13:29,900
assholes put all kinds of fucked up shit
that tastes great,

287
00:13:29,901 --> 00:13:30,734
but it's hugely bad for you and they've 
put it all throughout our food and they 

288
00:13:34,131 --> 00:13:35,630
did it when we were growing up.
I mean,

289
00:13:35,631 --> 00:13:36,260
come on,
man.

290
00:13:36,260 --> 00:13:39,950
We all eat lucky charms.
We all like cocoa puffs and fucking.

291
00:13:39,951 --> 00:13:43,850
I used to love captain crunch.
That shit is straight sugar.

292
00:13:43,851 --> 00:13:46,550
I would eat a whole bowl of that like a 
giant bowl.

293
00:13:46,710 --> 00:13:47,543
You know they sell just

294
00:13:47,620 --> 00:13:50,250
the berries now as a serial.
Oh God.

295
00:13:50,251 --> 00:13:51,460
Yeah.
That's insane.

296
00:13:51,461 --> 00:13:53,890
They're not even going to pretend fuck 
all that crunchy shit.

297
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:57,790
Just marshmallows and trans fats.
Cakes,

298
00:13:57,791 --> 00:14:00,010
pies and cookies.
Especially with frosting.

299
00:14:00,100 --> 00:14:00,911
Oh,
too bad.

300
00:14:00,911 --> 00:14:02,620
Those like hostess,
Apple Pies,

301
00:14:02,621 --> 00:14:05,440
those awesome hostess pies.
Microwave Popcorn,

302
00:14:05,650 --> 00:14:08,470
microwave popcorn as trans fats.
Frozen Pizza,

303
00:14:10,420 --> 00:14:12,420
fried fast foods cream filled

304
00:14:12,470 --> 00:14:14,300
candy,
crackers.

305
00:14:14,330 --> 00:14:15,850
Breakfast sandwiches,
cheese,

306
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:18,430
breakfast sandwiches.
Breakfast.

307
00:14:18,620 --> 00:14:20,310
Yeah.
What about like big macs?

308
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:22,470
Cleveland Clinic Max.
I mean,

309
00:14:22,471 --> 00:14:24,700
what about like the griddles because 
just because you said that.

310
00:14:24,701 --> 00:14:24,840
Okay.

311
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:27,080
Want one on the way home,
but I had one two days ago,

312
00:14:29,270 --> 00:14:33,470
so that typically contain at least one 
gram of trans fats.

313
00:14:33,620 --> 00:14:34,453
Take a close look at the ingredients and
you're likely to find partially 

314
00:14:36,321 --> 00:14:38,480
hydrogenated oils in the top five.
See,

315
00:14:38,481 --> 00:14:41,880
we used to think that that was good.
Partially hydrogenated oil,

316
00:14:41,910 --> 00:14:45,540
just partial,
partially hydrogenated corn oil.

317
00:14:46,470 --> 00:14:47,303
Amazing.

318
00:14:47,430 --> 00:14:50,880
We used to think that that was good.
People would prefer that you would think

319
00:14:50,881 --> 00:14:52,190
you making the healthy choice

320
00:14:52,190 --> 00:14:56,930
by choosing that motherfucker's it says 
if refrigerated or frozen dough produces

321
00:14:56,931 --> 00:14:58,820
a texture.
That seems too good to be true.

322
00:14:58,821 --> 00:15:01,940
It probably is.
God dammit.

323
00:15:02,180 --> 00:15:03,013
Yeah.
You gotta make it fresh and that's 

324
00:15:03,951 --> 00:15:06,690
probably what's in like Vegan ice cream 
and shit to make it all mushy.

325
00:15:08,550 --> 00:15:10,260
Yeah,
whatever they did to make vegan stuff.

326
00:15:10,261 --> 00:15:11,094
Good.
They did it because towards the end 

327
00:15:11,941 --> 00:15:12,774
there,
I'm telling you the Vegan stuff was 

328
00:15:13,501 --> 00:15:16,880
pretty good when I was doing it,
like the tastes of it was amazing.

329
00:15:16,950 --> 00:15:17,783
There's a lot of really good vegan chefs
out there that know what the fuck 

330
00:15:19,741 --> 00:15:20,574
they're doing.
Yeah.

331
00:15:20,730 --> 00:15:22,710
You know there's a place called follow 
your heart.

332
00:15:22,740 --> 00:15:25,560
It's like this cool little place in the 
valley that you can go and get these.

333
00:15:25,561 --> 00:15:28,080
I'm Vegan pancakes.
They're like Vegan,

334
00:15:28,081 --> 00:15:29,130
buckwheat,
pancakes.

335
00:15:29,131 --> 00:15:31,140
God damn good.
They just have no idea.

336
00:15:31,141 --> 00:15:32,970
There's no eggs in there or milk.

337
00:15:33,130 --> 00:15:35,750
There's a place at the one on one and 
the Bar Ham,

338
00:15:35,830 --> 00:15:36,663
same thing.
Vegan pancakes that are banana 

339
00:15:38,081 --> 00:15:41,360
blueberries and you can taste every 
fucking real blueberry.

340
00:15:41,390 --> 00:15:42,640
It's just one of those things.

341
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:43,913
Yeah,
they make some pretty decent like Vegan 

342
00:15:45,990 --> 00:15:47,010
Sandwich,
meat type products,

343
00:15:47,011 --> 00:15:49,080
you know,
but the thing about that is that kind of

344
00:15:49,090 --> 00:15:51,900
processed totally.
I mean there's a lot of preservatives in

345
00:15:51,901 --> 00:15:52,734
that stuff.
It's just to get something that's Vegan 

346
00:15:53,791 --> 00:15:56,610
doesn't mean it's necessarily good for 
you because Oreos are Vegan too.

347
00:15:56,690 --> 00:15:58,460
And I'm telling you it's very true 
because,

348
00:15:58,510 --> 00:16:00,380
you know,
I was a Vegan for five years and then my

349
00:16:00,381 --> 00:16:04,640
diet fucking completely changed.
I mean just steak every day for lunch at

350
00:16:04,641 --> 00:16:06,650
some point,
whether it's in a sandwich and a bowl of

351
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:08,250
fa.
Well,

352
00:16:08,270 --> 00:16:09,650
whatever it is,
you know what I mean?

353
00:16:10,090 --> 00:16:10,923
That's how you say it.

354
00:16:11,340 --> 00:16:13,410
What was the reason why you decided to 
make a shift?

355
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:14,673
Um,
a lot of it was just like I was just is 

356
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:19,670
more gone to than I am now.
I just couldn't keep up.

357
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:23,170
My schedule got busy and I just,
it wasn't that good at it.

358
00:16:23,171 --> 00:16:25,990
And it's impossible to do on the road.
It's impossible.

359
00:16:26,050 --> 00:16:29,200
And I did it.
I was eating fucking the bare minimums,

360
00:16:29,201 --> 00:16:32,530
like French fries and you end up out 
there and you got nothing.

361
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:33,393
Even if you go French fries,
so a lot of times that's boiled and 

362
00:16:34,860 --> 00:16:35,530
before.
Yeah,

363
00:16:35,530 --> 00:16:35,961
no.
Yeah,

364
00:16:35,961 --> 00:16:39,000
I know beef fat.
Yeah.

365
00:16:39,270 --> 00:16:40,810
It's like an,
it was just a nightmare,

366
00:16:40,870 --> 00:16:43,150
but I mean it was also,
you know,

367
00:16:43,151 --> 00:16:44,770
at the time I had a really,
you know,

368
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:48,400
cool smart girlfriend who was Vegan.
It was cooking amazing stuff,

369
00:16:48,401 --> 00:16:52,180
fucking Vegan enchiladas once a week 
that were just mind blowing and all this

370
00:16:52,181 --> 00:16:54,310
stuff.
So it was sort of easy for me and at the

371
00:16:54,311 --> 00:16:55,144
time,
you know,

372
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:57,070
I was just looking for anything to help.

373
00:16:57,220 --> 00:16:59,120
And what was the day that you did it?
Why did you do it?

374
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:02,010
I know you had a lot of influence.
We were going to.

375
00:17:02,011 --> 00:17:06,290
A lot of great steakhouses wasn't long 
after I started working with you and I'm

376
00:17:06,291 --> 00:17:08,730
just watching you eat a steak and then 
you know,

377
00:17:08,731 --> 00:17:09,600
you're,
you know,

378
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:10,993
and I wasn't getting.
My energy levels have completely 

379
00:17:13,141 --> 00:17:13,974
changed.
I go to the gym every day now pretty 

380
00:17:15,481 --> 00:17:16,051
much,
you know,

381
00:17:16,051 --> 00:17:16,680
six,
five,

382
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:18,870
six days a week and knock something out 
and it's.

383
00:17:18,930 --> 00:17:20,520
I just wasn't like that before,

384
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:21,473
but isn't it funny?
But if I brought this up to you while 

385
00:17:23,011 --> 00:17:23,844
you were a Vegan,
you would just be raving about how much 

386
00:17:25,831 --> 00:17:29,670
energy you have and how healthy you are.
Like that's one thing that people always

387
00:17:29,671 --> 00:17:30,750
do,
no matter what they're doing.

388
00:17:30,751 --> 00:17:33,660
I mean I'm guilty of it myself.
When you're doing something,

389
00:17:33,930 --> 00:17:34,763
you want to promote whatever that thing 
is because you want other people to do 

390
00:17:37,231 --> 00:17:38,064
it.
So you start ranting and raving about 

391
00:17:40,051 --> 00:17:41,010
how great it is.

392
00:17:41,150 --> 00:17:44,630
And it was for a because.
And I thought that it was that,

393
00:17:44,631 --> 00:17:45,464
but it also probably had a lot to do 
with the timing of everything was where 

394
00:17:47,771 --> 00:17:48,604
you started making money for the first 
time in comedy around that very same 

395
00:17:52,111 --> 00:17:54,120
time when I started dating that Vegan 
girl,

396
00:17:54,121 --> 00:17:54,954
that was the beginning of the five years
of that like it was when I started 

397
00:17:57,961 --> 00:18:00,840
getting to do the road a lot with like 
Jeff Ross back then.

398
00:18:00,841 --> 00:18:04,110
And I started writing on the roast back 
then and I had a little bit of money and

399
00:18:04,111 --> 00:18:04,944
things were going good.
So I think that that played a lot into 

400
00:18:07,621 --> 00:18:10,500
my like energy and just feeling good 
overall was,

401
00:18:10,550 --> 00:18:12,000
you know,
being able to survive

402
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:14,320
was the first place.
Did you go to Fogo de Chao or something?

403
00:18:14,321 --> 00:18:16,300
Is that what you did?
You guys all went.

404
00:18:16,430 --> 00:18:17,490
So you were there,
you saw us?

405
00:18:17,770 --> 00:18:19,130
Oh yeah.
I think I bought your.

406
00:18:19,131 --> 00:18:20,870
Me.
I was happy.

407
00:18:20,871 --> 00:18:23,900
It was like a holiday for me because it 
was awful.

408
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:27,980
Having like your friend and especially 
being on the road and you just wanted to

409
00:18:27,981 --> 00:18:28,814
go to an awesome restaurant and then I 
don't know about these options that we 

410
00:18:31,971 --> 00:18:33,530
have here.
I was never that way.

411
00:18:33,770 --> 00:18:34,401
No,
no.

412
00:18:34,401 --> 00:18:35,234
I was never that way.
He would always make a thing about it 

413
00:18:37,010 --> 00:18:38,570
before I die.
Are you able to eat here?

414
00:18:38,610 --> 00:18:41,090
Like they never had a problem,
but it's all good.

415
00:18:41,690 --> 00:18:45,140
The point is is that that first day,
even after Fogo de Chao,

416
00:18:45,141 --> 00:18:45,974
remember,
I was like a fucking pit bull after 

417
00:18:46,851 --> 00:18:47,684
that.
Like that night you called me up 

418
00:18:48,701 --> 00:18:50,510
screaming.
That night I was,

419
00:18:51,930 --> 00:18:55,100
I made a beat.
Now I'm a different person.

420
00:18:55,190 --> 00:18:57,620
It felt like,
what the fuck happened to Tony?

421
00:18:57,710 --> 00:19:01,250
It was,
I've never done like real steroids,

422
00:19:01,251 --> 00:19:04,970
but I'd imagine that exact.
I felt like a fucking animal.

423
00:19:04,980 --> 00:19:06,750
Did you still have.
You haven't had elk yet?

424
00:19:06,930 --> 00:19:07,770
Now?
I've never.

425
00:19:07,830 --> 00:19:09,660
Oh my God.
In the.

426
00:19:09,690 --> 00:19:11,670
When we set up,
I'm getting a new grill.

427
00:19:11,671 --> 00:19:15,270
I'm getting a new yoga grill and I'm 
putting my old one at the studio.

428
00:19:15,390 --> 00:19:16,890
I want to set up at the studio because 
you know,

429
00:19:16,891 --> 00:19:20,760
I have freezers back there.
I'm going to grill some steaks.

430
00:19:20,820 --> 00:19:22,200
Great.
At the studio.

431
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:24,180
You got to eat it.
I mean you're,

432
00:19:24,230 --> 00:19:25,063
you're gonna feel you're gonna.
Feel another bump above where you're at 

433
00:19:28,021 --> 00:19:28,854
now.
Like I used to watch Ted nugent and I'm 

434
00:19:30,231 --> 00:19:31,470
just like,
where's this crazy fucker?

435
00:19:31,471 --> 00:19:33,840
Get all his energy because he's crazy as
shit.

436
00:19:33,841 --> 00:19:34,674
Right?
And he's yelling and screaming and then 

437
00:19:35,851 --> 00:19:37,650
he's like,
he's like 70 something years old.

438
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:38,670
And I'm like,
how does,

439
00:19:38,670 --> 00:19:39,990
how does you have so much God damn 
energy?

440
00:19:40,140 --> 00:19:40,973
And then I saw him.
He had this interview once where he's 

441
00:19:42,601 --> 00:19:44,550
cooking the steak,
this deer steak.

442
00:19:44,550 --> 00:19:45,383
This is years ago.
It was probably one of the things that 

443
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:47,833
is before I ever hunted,
one of the things that popped into my 

444
00:19:49,141 --> 00:19:49,974
head,
the idea of hunting and he was cutting 

445
00:19:52,351 --> 00:19:55,410
up this piece of meat and showing like 
how red and dark it wasn't talking about

446
00:19:55,411 --> 00:19:59,010
how many nutrients that there was in it 
and how much more nutritious and healthy

447
00:19:59,011 --> 00:19:59,844
it is than store bought meat that has 
hormones in it and antibiotics and all 

448
00:20:03,361 --> 00:20:04,194
this jazz and I remember thinking 
motherfuckers probably right and then 

449
00:20:06,721 --> 00:20:07,554
the first time I deer meat from an 
animal that I shot and I was sitting 

450
00:20:10,861 --> 00:20:12,520
there eating and I was like,
God damn it.

451
00:20:12,900 --> 00:20:14,300
I feel it.
You can.

452
00:20:14,420 --> 00:20:18,240
It's like a extra charge to it.
Why do you think that is?

453
00:20:18,241 --> 00:20:21,120
Do you still really healthy animals?
If you.

454
00:20:21,121 --> 00:20:24,270
If you eat a deer,
you're eating a wild sprinter.

455
00:20:24,690 --> 00:20:25,523
I mean it's a wild sprinting machine 
that's trying to get away from eating 

456
00:20:28,111 --> 00:20:29,880
machines,
eating machines at what?

457
00:20:29,881 --> 00:20:32,520
Literally want to tear it apart.
Like that's it's life.

458
00:20:32,521 --> 00:20:33,510
It's like,
what was that noise?

459
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:38,310
If you see a deer and the wild and just 
constantly like was gone over here,

460
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:39,473
let's go.
They bounce every now and then they 

461
00:20:40,501 --> 00:20:43,140
scare each other and then they have to 
fucking chill and come back.

462
00:20:43,250 --> 00:20:46,910
Is there a restaurant at least in Los 
Angeles that serves dear,

463
00:20:46,911 --> 00:20:48,340
like even that place in Calabasas,

464
00:20:48,340 --> 00:20:51,040
like what?
You can get some places that serve it,

465
00:20:51,041 --> 00:20:51,874
but here's what's ironic.
Most of the stuff that they serve comes 

466
00:20:54,011 --> 00:20:54,844
from New Zealand.
Most of the venison that you buy comes 

467
00:20:57,221 --> 00:20:58,054
from New Zealand and New Zealand.
New Zealand's a treatment because New 

468
00:21:00,970 --> 00:21:05,140
Zealand is this gorgeous island.
I want to visit New Zealand just to look

469
00:21:05,141 --> 00:21:08,590
around because also because it's where 
they filmed the hobbit and she's like,

470
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:11,320
you look at those scenes,
those landscapes.

471
00:21:11,321 --> 00:21:12,880
When they.
When you watched the Hobbit,

472
00:21:12,881 --> 00:21:13,780
you go,
my God,

473
00:21:13,781 --> 00:21:16,510
where is this?
But it's real in New Zealand.

474
00:21:16,750 --> 00:21:19,990
My friend remy is a hunting guide.
Remy Warren.

475
00:21:19,991 --> 00:21:20,824
He's been on the podcast before and he 
goes to New Zealand once a year and 

476
00:21:24,641 --> 00:21:28,000
guides people over New Zealand.
He sent me some pictures of like what it

477
00:21:28,001 --> 00:21:28,930
looks like there.
I just,

478
00:21:28,990 --> 00:21:30,760
I don't even want to go there to hunt.
I'm not.

479
00:21:30,820 --> 00:21:31,653
I want to go there just as a vacation,
just to see what it's like because it's 

480
00:21:33,521 --> 00:21:34,354
supposed to be just stunning to look at 
waterfalls and everything is green and 

481
00:21:37,421 --> 00:21:39,280
lush,
but here's what's fucked up about it.

482
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:40,113
Didn't have any animals on it.
He's people from England came over to 

483
00:21:43,571 --> 00:21:46,870
New Zealand and put all these animals.
They're so.

484
00:21:46,871 --> 00:21:47,704
There was very little local wildlife and
the local wildlife they had was so 

485
00:21:52,391 --> 00:21:53,224
fucked up.
They wind up killing off a bunch of 

486
00:21:54,521 --> 00:21:56,470
them.
They used to have an eagle there.

487
00:21:56,560 --> 00:21:59,650
It's called the.
It's called the Haas Eagle that had a 14

488
00:21:59,651 --> 00:22:02,620
foot wingspan and they think it hunted 
people.

489
00:22:04,390 --> 00:22:07,450
They think it's one of the reasons why 
they exterminated that thing.

490
00:22:07,930 --> 00:22:09,640
Wow.
Yes.

491
00:22:09,700 --> 00:22:11,590
Oh my God.
What in the fuck?

492
00:22:11,591 --> 00:22:13,840
How cool is that?
Double check my math.

493
00:22:13,870 --> 00:22:14,703
I'm pretty sure it's 14 feet long,
but it's way bigger than the biggest 

494
00:22:17,471 --> 00:22:18,940
eagle we have today.
Way Bigger.

495
00:22:18,941 --> 00:22:19,774
It was the biggest eagle ever and there 
was a lot of speculation that preyed on 

496
00:22:22,121 --> 00:22:24,820
humans,
but New Zealand has no predators,

497
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:25,833
so New Zealand has like all these elk 
and deer and everything and a lot of 

498
00:22:29,501 --> 00:22:30,334
them are like fenced in and then they 
slaughter them and send them back to 

499
00:22:33,161 --> 00:22:33,994
America.

500
00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:39,290
They send it all over the world costs 
eagle h a s a h,

501
00:22:39,310 --> 00:22:43,030
a s eagle.
It's an extinct eagle from New Zealand.

502
00:22:43,150 --> 00:22:45,940
I think it only lived on New Zealand as 
far as we know,

503
00:22:46,030 --> 00:22:48,430
two to three meters.
That's about three meters.

504
00:22:48,750 --> 00:22:50,440
That's nine feet.
I'm full of Shit.

505
00:22:51,340 --> 00:22:53,170
God Damn it.
I thought it was 14 feet.

506
00:22:53,350 --> 00:22:54,183
I think.
Go find something else because I swear 

507
00:22:55,571 --> 00:22:56,404
to God,
something said that it was bigger than 

508
00:22:57,341 --> 00:22:58,090
that.
You know what?

509
00:22:58,090 --> 00:23:02,140
We did this on the podcast before we 
went over this on the podcast,

510
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:04,030
there was an episode where I said,
Oh,

511
00:23:04,031 --> 00:23:04,864
I thought it was bigger than that,
and then we found out other places did 

512
00:23:07,661 --> 00:23:09,430
say it was bigger than that.
Now I remember.

513
00:23:09,460 --> 00:23:10,293
Okay,
so you see if you could find one that 

514
00:23:11,860 --> 00:23:16,760
core operates my shitbag memory.
What should we do with this thing?

515
00:23:17,560 --> 00:23:18,850
Dude,
I'm all vape pens these days.

516
00:23:18,860 --> 00:23:19,693
You don't want to smoke it.

517
00:23:19,930 --> 00:23:20,763
Whoa.

518
00:23:22,190 --> 00:23:23,023
So if you don't have predators,
like they don't have bears or wolves 

519
00:23:25,590 --> 00:23:27,110
have nothing.
They have nothing.

520
00:23:27,111 --> 00:23:29,260
So these God damn things are everywhere 
and they,

521
00:23:29,261 --> 00:23:30,290
they,
they slaughter them.

522
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:33,350
They get so bad that sometimes they have
to shoot him out of helicopters,

523
00:23:33,850 --> 00:23:34,683
don't overpopulate areas.
So they fly over these areas and gunned 

524
00:23:38,121 --> 00:23:40,760
down these stags with helicopters and 
leave them to rot.

525
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,730
What a panda bears eat like you can live
to.

526
00:23:44,350 --> 00:23:45,290
That's weird.
Yeah.

527
00:23:45,291 --> 00:23:46,250
They're vegetarians,
right?

528
00:23:46,280 --> 00:23:47,330
Yeah.
Pretty much.

529
00:23:47,331 --> 00:23:48,164
They do a lot of rape in though panda 
bears apparently the rape the fuck out 

530
00:23:50,901 --> 00:23:53,390
of each other and not pandas.
I'm thinking of cool.

531
00:23:53,430 --> 00:23:55,370
Those qualities of the Eucalyptus.
We are too.

532
00:23:57,140 --> 00:24:01,550
It's funny because we thought that.
But um,

533
00:24:01,730 --> 00:24:03,290
so anyway,
New Zealand is.

534
00:24:03,291 --> 00:24:04,124
I'm so wild game meat that you get.
If you go to a restaurant and you have 

535
00:24:08,031 --> 00:24:10,400
like elk,
you by elk today,

536
00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:12,920
most likely you're getting it from New 
Zealand.

537
00:24:12,950 --> 00:24:16,280
What was that one meat that you gave me?
One time it was cooked.

538
00:24:16,820 --> 00:24:19,190
It was the best meal I've ever had in my
life.

539
00:24:19,191 --> 00:24:20,690
That was wild boar for.
Yeah,

540
00:24:20,700 --> 00:24:22,400
there was smoke ball.
Oh my God.

541
00:24:22,401 --> 00:24:25,490
That was.
I remember thinking there's nothing I've

542
00:24:25,491 --> 00:24:26,960
ever tasted.
That was that good?

543
00:24:27,080 --> 00:24:28,520
Yeah.
Well it tastes different than anything.

544
00:24:28,521 --> 00:24:29,354
I cooked it for my kids the other day 
and my wife was saying what while we're 

545
00:24:31,761 --> 00:24:32,700
eating it.
Charlotte,

546
00:24:32,710 --> 00:24:33,860
sorry to hear that.
She was like,

547
00:24:33,890 --> 00:24:34,723
this does not taste like any other kind 
of meat because you're eating a wild 

548
00:24:38,361 --> 00:24:41,060
animal that's struggling and surviving 
the acorns and shit.

549
00:24:41,090 --> 00:24:44,220
It was like dark pig times too.
It was like pig,

550
00:24:44,850 --> 00:24:45,683
like dark meat,
Latin restaurants because you gotta you 

551
00:24:51,561 --> 00:24:53,170
gotTa Kill Them.
You got to go out.

552
00:24:53,210 --> 00:24:54,800
You'd have to go out and hunt them and 
kill them.

553
00:24:54,860 --> 00:24:55,550
There should be like.

554
00:24:55,550 --> 00:24:58,670
But there's weird laws about that.
There's weird laws in this country about

555
00:24:58,671 --> 00:25:01,610
wild game and it's good.
There's are good laws because the reason

556
00:25:01,611 --> 00:25:02,444
why they establish these losses because 
in the 18 hundreds we had almost no 

557
00:25:05,781 --> 00:25:09,490
animals left because of market hunting.
When market hunting is,

558
00:25:09,491 --> 00:25:12,530
is after the civil war,
and actually even before that,

559
00:25:13,260 --> 00:25:14,720
no,
they didn't have refrigerators man.

560
00:25:14,990 --> 00:25:17,420
And so if you wanted meat,
you had to get it pretty fresh.

561
00:25:17,630 --> 00:25:20,270
It had to be killed like within the last
couple of days.

562
00:25:20,690 --> 00:25:24,950
And so what they would do is they would 
go to these,

563
00:25:24,980 --> 00:25:25,761
um,
uh,

564
00:25:25,761 --> 00:25:26,594
soldiers who had come back from the war 
and really didn't have anything to do 

565
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:30,913
and these guys would get hired by these 
meat companies and they would just go 

566
00:25:33,891 --> 00:25:34,724
out and shoot buffalo and elk and deer.
And at a certain point in time they had 

567
00:25:38,811 --> 00:25:43,811
almost eradicated all of the wild game 
animals in this country that,

568
00:25:44,061 --> 00:25:44,894
you know,
today,

569
00:25:45,080 --> 00:25:46,100
like wild deer.

570
00:25:46,130 --> 00:25:46,963
There was almost no deer left.
And the early 18 hundreds and the early 

571
00:25:49,521 --> 00:25:51,350
19 hundreds,
the turn of the century,

572
00:25:51,590 --> 00:25:54,110
you would be super lucky if you saw a 
deer.

573
00:25:54,111 --> 00:25:54,944
If you went deer hunting,
it'd be super lucky if you saw a deer 

574
00:25:56,721 --> 00:25:58,530
and they wouldn't be a big deer.
Everybody just,

575
00:25:58,730 --> 00:26:02,690
everybody just went buck wild on him.
It was common in preparing themselves.

576
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:03,793
There should be a subscription box 
service that lets you order hunting 

577
00:26:08,031 --> 00:26:08,791
meat.
No,

578
00:26:08,791 --> 00:26:09,051
no,
no,

579
00:26:09,051 --> 00:26:09,291
no,
no,

580
00:26:09,291 --> 00:26:09,910
you this,
you don't.

581
00:26:09,910 --> 00:26:10,743
You're getting me wrong.
I just explained that you can't sell it 

582
00:26:12,711 --> 00:26:13,544
because of that market hunting wiped out
all those animals because they sold 

583
00:26:16,731 --> 00:26:18,200
them,
so they made laws,

584
00:26:18,201 --> 00:26:22,160
established laws that say you cannot 
sell wild game,

585
00:26:22,520 --> 00:26:23,353
so if you go to public land and there's 
a good percentage of the hunting that's 

586
00:26:26,631 --> 00:26:30,710
done in the United States,
at least is done on public land,

587
00:26:30,860 --> 00:26:34,700
and what that means is Freddy Roosevelt 
a or a theater.

588
00:26:34,701 --> 00:26:38,840
Roosevelt in his wisdom,
realize that we have all this incredible

589
00:26:38,841 --> 00:26:42,800
land in the United States.
Who's Freddy's brother?

590
00:26:42,830 --> 00:26:44,180
Freddy Roosevelt.
You're thinking?

591
00:26:44,910 --> 00:26:48,570
Yeah,
but I said Freddy Roosevelt Franklin,

592
00:26:48,571 --> 00:26:50,550
but I was thinking of Teddy.
Yeah.

593
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:53,160
Yeah.
The Theater Roosevelt.

594
00:26:54,160 --> 00:26:54,993
But was it Franklin Roosevelt who 
established for two different 

595
00:26:57,781 --> 00:26:58,591
Roosevelt's?
No.

596
00:26:58,591 --> 00:27:00,300
Teddy and theory is the same,
right?

597
00:27:00,570 --> 00:27:02,300
No,
teddy,

598
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:04,290
but Freddie Franklin,
Franklin,

599
00:27:04,291 --> 00:27:06,150
Franklin Delano Roosevelt,
a different person.

600
00:27:06,970 --> 00:27:07,803
When was he president?
Theodore Roosevelt Guy who set it all 

601
00:27:11,791 --> 00:27:12,720
up.
Anyway,

602
00:27:12,810 --> 00:27:15,750
Theodore Roosevelt set up conservation 
for like,

603
00:27:15,870 --> 00:27:18,900
I'm good dude tonight.
Ten 33 to 45.

604
00:27:19,140 --> 00:27:20,730
Which one is that?
Franklin Franklin.

605
00:27:20,790 --> 00:27:22,410
Oh,
so Teddy Roosevelt,

606
00:27:22,450 --> 00:27:23,283
the original.

607
00:27:25,350 --> 00:27:28,950
That's why they called the teddy bear me
establish things like,

608
00:27:29,010 --> 00:27:30,690
um,
like um,

609
00:27:30,750 --> 00:27:32,940
yellowstone,
like when you go to yellowstone,

610
00:27:32,970 --> 00:27:36,030
that's all because of those guys,
like in the people in his era,

611
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:39,620
they looked at all this amazing land and
they realized like,

612
00:27:39,630 --> 00:27:42,330
we can't let this go away.
Like this is really important.

613
00:27:42,660 --> 00:27:45,780
Like we gotta keep this public.
We got to keep this.

614
00:27:46,010 --> 00:27:46,843
We got to figure out a way where 
everyone can go and enjoy this and not 

615
00:27:48,601 --> 00:27:49,434
have someone just put a fence around it 
and make it impossible for people to 

616
00:27:51,631 --> 00:27:55,020
traverse.
So they set up all these public lands in

617
00:27:55,021 --> 00:27:57,060
this country that are.
It's really rare.

618
00:27:57,270 --> 00:28:02,270
You don't have these giant chunks of 
land that no one can buy or sell in this

619
00:28:02,281 --> 00:28:03,114
country.
We do.

620
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:05,310
It's really,
really rare in other countries.

621
00:28:05,430 --> 00:28:06,263
What are some of the other animals that 
tastes good that we don't ever get to 

622
00:28:08,431 --> 00:28:11,310
eat for El boar and elk are prime.

623
00:28:11,320 --> 00:28:14,820
Harriet Belk is probably the best meat 
you'll ever have in your life.

624
00:28:15,020 --> 00:28:17,880
It it tastes so much better than beef.
It's just,

625
00:28:18,120 --> 00:28:18,953
it's just a pure meat.
It's pure and you're eating an animal 

626
00:28:21,571 --> 00:28:22,740
that eating when it's supposed to eat 
too.

627
00:28:22,741 --> 00:28:25,260
It's a healthy animal that's in the 
prime of its life,

628
00:28:25,290 --> 00:28:26,123
so you can really only get it if you 
hunted you only or if you have a friend 

629
00:28:28,231 --> 00:28:29,370
that's a hunter.
The only way.

630
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:31,170
The only way.
The only way.

631
00:28:31,370 --> 00:28:32,203
Weird.
Yeah.

632
00:28:32,210 --> 00:28:34,680
It's weird.
It's weird because that's what we should

633
00:28:34,681 --> 00:28:37,950
be eating.
I mean it's so unamerican to not be able

634
00:28:37,951 --> 00:28:39,140
to buy something.
No,

635
00:28:39,260 --> 00:28:41,190
you can't because we would wipe it out.
Right?

636
00:28:41,191 --> 00:28:42,750
It's smart.
We would wipe it out.

637
00:28:42,751 --> 00:28:45,330
But what if you have farm raised wild 
anymore?

638
00:28:45,331 --> 00:28:46,164
Then not only that,
when they do that and they have done 

639
00:28:47,701 --> 00:28:48,534
that,
they do raise wild ones and they put 

640
00:28:50,251 --> 00:28:52,260
them in these pens and they put fences 
around them.

641
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:53,273
The problem is we're not supposed to be 
eating all of the same spot and when 

642
00:28:56,041 --> 00:28:57,590
they do,
they develop diseases.

643
00:28:57,630 --> 00:29:00,990
They don't have immune systems for them,
so they develop something called chronic

644
00:29:00,991 --> 00:29:01,824
wasting disease.
So it was a giant issue in a lot of 

645
00:29:04,171 --> 00:29:06,270
parts of the midwest where they took 
these animals,

646
00:29:06,271 --> 00:29:07,104
and this is just speculation,
they don't exactly know what caused his 

647
00:29:09,451 --> 00:29:11,730
chronic wasting disease,
but it didn't exist before.

648
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:12,713
These farm systems where they would grow
these deer in these pens and so these 

649
00:29:16,710 --> 00:29:19,470
put these high fence operations up,
these giant chain link fences.

650
00:29:19,471 --> 00:29:20,304
The deer can't get out,
they're all stuck in there and they 

651
00:29:21,901 --> 00:29:24,270
would feed them and when you feed these 
deer,

652
00:29:24,271 --> 00:29:25,104
they'd be eating each other's saliva and
they would develop all these diseases 

653
00:29:28,171 --> 00:29:30,480
they never developed before because 
there were grass eaters.

654
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:33,450
They're supposed to be out there eating 
wild vegetation.

655
00:29:33,630 --> 00:29:34,463
That's what is supposed to be eating 
sage and grasses and all the different 

656
00:29:36,931 --> 00:29:38,670
things that you see.
Like you know when you see a,

657
00:29:38,820 --> 00:29:39,653
a buffalo roaming in a field,
that's what they're supposed to be 

658
00:29:41,531 --> 00:29:42,310
eating,
man.

659
00:29:42,310 --> 00:29:44,470
But we've in our wisdom,
have realized,

660
00:29:44,471 --> 00:29:45,304
oh,
we can get these fuckers fatter if we 

661
00:29:46,211 --> 00:29:48,190
just stick them in this thing and make 
me eat corn.

662
00:29:48,430 --> 00:29:51,010
And so that's what fucked up our food in
this country.

663
00:29:51,011 --> 00:29:51,844
It's what?
It's the same thing that fucked up the 

664
00:29:54,310 --> 00:29:56,830
production of processed foods with all 
the sugar.

665
00:29:56,831 --> 00:29:58,090
It's the same goddamn wisdom.

666
00:29:58,200 --> 00:30:01,470
I don't think we're far away though for 
having like cloning food,

667
00:30:01,471 --> 00:30:02,460
being able to like,
hey,

668
00:30:02,461 --> 00:30:04,520
we can make food nowadays.
They can do it.

669
00:30:04,930 --> 00:30:06,610
You can do it.
Yeah.

670
00:30:06,780 --> 00:30:07,613
Do you think though it's not far away 
that where you could actually buy a 

671
00:30:10,681 --> 00:30:11,940
certain thing.
You go to the grocery story.

672
00:30:11,941 --> 00:30:12,774
This is fake food,
but you can buy like bore and all the 

673
00:30:15,490 --> 00:30:16,290
game.

674
00:30:16,290 --> 00:30:17,123
It probably won't taste the same for the
same reason why a cow doesn't taste the 

675
00:30:19,921 --> 00:30:21,090
same.
If it eats grass,

676
00:30:21,330 --> 00:30:24,720
like if you give a cow grass,
it becomes this different animal.

677
00:30:24,990 --> 00:30:28,200
If you give a cow corn,
it becomes this fatty,

678
00:30:28,201 --> 00:30:31,320
lighter colored animal is a lot of 
people think is more delicious.

679
00:30:31,470 --> 00:30:32,303
A lot of people like that better that 
like corn fed better include Anthony 

680
00:30:35,340 --> 00:30:37,350
Bourdain.
He likes the corn fed beef.

681
00:30:37,550 --> 00:30:38,480
You know,
it really does.

682
00:30:38,481 --> 00:30:40,080
It does.
I really like a fatty steak,

683
00:30:40,110 --> 00:30:42,180
but he's also a chef.
You know,

684
00:30:42,181 --> 00:30:45,870
he knows how to cook it perfectly and 
under manipulate that fat and you know,

685
00:30:46,140 --> 00:30:46,973
marble it perfectly or the cookie 
perfectly rather the marbling and all 

686
00:30:50,071 --> 00:30:51,330
that sort of hang out with him,
Huh?

687
00:30:51,810 --> 00:30:52,561
Yeah.
A couple times.

688
00:30:52,561 --> 00:30:55,830
One hunting with him.
Does he love his life as much as I think

689
00:30:55,831 --> 00:30:56,664
he should.

690
00:30:56,800 --> 00:30:58,860
Here's the restaurant in the world 
according to him.

691
00:30:59,180 --> 00:31:00,170
You know,
we.

692
00:31:00,380 --> 00:31:01,213
What?
Did you guys have the world's best job 

693
00:31:02,641 --> 00:31:04,320
in the world off with each other?
No.

694
00:31:04,340 --> 00:31:05,300
No,
like youtube.

695
00:31:05,620 --> 00:31:06,453
Well,
wouldn't you like to have the only 

696
00:31:07,351 --> 00:31:11,490
people that I know that really,
really like seems like you guys should.

697
00:31:11,580 --> 00:31:12,630
I mean,
I know you do.

698
00:31:12,631 --> 00:31:14,790
I don't know him,
but I have always hoped like,

699
00:31:14,791 --> 00:31:15,624
man,
I hope he fucking knows what he's doing 

700
00:31:16,891 --> 00:31:18,810
is everybody's dream job.
Oh,

701
00:31:18,811 --> 00:31:20,540
for sure.
He knows and I know too.

702
00:31:20,570 --> 00:31:21,403
Yeah.
I definitely know that I have dream 

703
00:31:22,651 --> 00:31:25,020
jobs,
but my dream is different than his dream

704
00:31:25,021 --> 00:31:26,430
job.
We just both have dream job.

705
00:31:26,460 --> 00:31:28,710
But you guys found your own dream jobs 
is what I'm saying?

706
00:31:28,711 --> 00:31:29,311
Oh,
for sure.

707
00:31:29,311 --> 00:31:30,720
Yeah.
Like his dream job.

708
00:31:30,750 --> 00:31:31,583
Absolutely.
One hundred percent is doing what he 

709
00:31:32,941 --> 00:31:34,350
does,
he fucking loves it man.

710
00:31:34,680 --> 00:31:38,460
And you know,
he's also like super into Jujitsu now,

711
00:31:38,490 --> 00:31:39,420
which is really weird.

712
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:42,480
So everywhere he goes,
he's born in Jujitsu than I ever was.

713
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:44,850
He trains every day,
every fucking day.

714
00:31:45,800 --> 00:31:47,480
Every day.
Was that his lady?

715
00:31:47,690 --> 00:31:49,890
But they got divorced but he's still 
like.

716
00:31:49,950 --> 00:31:52,720
But there were super good friends.
They just lived separate,

717
00:31:52,721 --> 00:31:55,770
like he's on the road all the time,
but they have a kid together and they're

718
00:31:55,800 --> 00:31:58,080
really close and they raised the kid 
together and it's like,

719
00:31:58,081 --> 00:32:01,260
it's not a bad situation at all.
He's a great guy.

720
00:32:01,530 --> 00:32:02,490
He's a very,
very,

721
00:32:02,491 --> 00:32:05,200
very smart guy and very real guy.
You know,

722
00:32:05,230 --> 00:32:06,063
it was very [inaudible] me,
he need just found something in Jujitsu 

723
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:12,960
and just pursued it and he's getting a 
reward out of it and he chases it down.

724
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:15,270
He's like,
he goes to these places,

725
00:32:15,271 --> 00:32:17,280
man,
he's just sucking this world up.

726
00:32:17,700 --> 00:32:18,533
You know,
he's in Jamaica or China or anywhere 

727
00:32:20,761 --> 00:32:22,980
he's going,
he's just stuck in these places up.

728
00:32:22,990 --> 00:32:23,823
He's just pulling them in and writing 
about them and talking about them and 

729
00:32:26,521 --> 00:32:27,354
experiencing them.
And you get that from the show fucking 

730
00:32:29,610 --> 00:32:30,580
powerful show,
man.

731
00:32:30,630 --> 00:32:31,463
It really fucking is because he's 
somehow able to really tap into that 

732
00:32:36,061 --> 00:32:38,130
culture as fast as possible.
Again,

733
00:32:38,140 --> 00:32:40,160
with whoever those are that are doing,

734
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:41,300
like,
you know,

735
00:32:41,301 --> 00:32:42,860
there's a whole thing that has to go 
into that.

736
00:32:42,861 --> 00:32:45,380
It's not like Anthony's calling places 
in Cuba,

737
00:32:45,410 --> 00:32:46,243
you know what I mean?
So whoever's producing that and doing 

738
00:32:47,901 --> 00:32:52,901
that research and he makes every little 
bite look unbelievable

739
00:32:53,330 --> 00:32:54,163
what is called zero point zero.
And they're the same company that 

740
00:32:55,731 --> 00:32:56,564
produces mediator,
same show or same production company 

741
00:32:59,841 --> 00:33:00,674
that produces those two amazing show.
So they didn't know what the fuck 

742
00:33:03,201 --> 00:33:04,760
they're doing.
They make great stuff.

743
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:06,080
It's amazing.
Yeah.

744
00:33:06,081 --> 00:33:07,190
It's um,
and again,

745
00:33:07,191 --> 00:33:08,210
for him,
that's his dream job.

746
00:33:08,211 --> 00:33:08,931
Me,
I'd be like,

747
00:33:08,931 --> 00:33:11,270
yeah,
let me the fuck home.

748
00:33:11,660 --> 00:33:13,250
I don't like traveling that much.
I mean,

749
00:33:13,251 --> 00:33:17,780
I traveled pawlenty and I'm,
I'm home for a lot lately.

750
00:33:17,781 --> 00:33:18,614
I'm home more now than ever before.
And I like it a lot better and I'm not 

751
00:33:21,680 --> 00:33:22,513
working less.
I'm working just as much on getting a 

752
00:33:23,811 --> 00:33:24,644
lot of shit done.
But all that air travel and all that 

753
00:33:26,781 --> 00:33:28,760
stuff that.
That is bullshit.

754
00:33:29,030 --> 00:33:30,710
You're working smarter.
Yeah.

755
00:33:30,970 --> 00:33:32,900
But I just realized like there's a way 
to do this.

756
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:35,920
And another thing that helped fucking 
tremendously,

757
00:33:35,921 --> 00:33:39,470
it's coming back to the store because 
I'm working on shit all the time.

758
00:33:39,520 --> 00:33:40,353
I did four sets here the other night on 
last Thursday I did four sets and I'm 

759
00:33:43,581 --> 00:33:44,414
like,
I can do four sets on a Thursday night 

760
00:33:45,861 --> 00:33:48,770
at the same goddamn club.
Don't need to go anywhere.

761
00:33:48,860 --> 00:33:51,920
Like I do eventually.
I mean I do like to do the road.

762
00:33:51,921 --> 00:33:53,810
I do like to,
but even the road,

763
00:33:53,811 --> 00:33:54,644
like what I'm doing the road,
I'm doing less theaters than ever 

764
00:33:57,110 --> 00:33:58,170
because I'm like,
uh,

765
00:33:58,230 --> 00:34:00,240
I have more fun at clubs.
Like it's,

766
00:34:00,310 --> 00:34:02,430
I like 300 people.
That's what I like.

767
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:04,310
You get more work done by doing more 
sets.

768
00:34:04,340 --> 00:34:05,173
Exactly.
You get more work done by doing more 

769
00:34:06,591 --> 00:34:08,750
sets,
but also the experience you're not going

770
00:34:08,751 --> 00:34:11,630
to get as much money with the experience
is a different experience,

771
00:34:11,631 --> 00:34:12,464
a better experience.
It's more standup and you're connected 

772
00:34:15,261 --> 00:34:17,240
to those people.
Whereas those theaters,

773
00:34:17,241 --> 00:34:19,370
a lot of it is really fun,
you know,

774
00:34:19,371 --> 00:34:21,380
like New Year's was a fucking blast.
Right.

775
00:34:21,650 --> 00:34:24,170
But a lot of it is a show,

776
00:34:26,770 --> 00:34:27,603
right?

777
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:29,300
Big Ass show,
big lighting,

778
00:34:29,330 --> 00:34:31,060
change.
People there,

779
00:34:31,120 --> 00:34:31,953
you know,
a lot of it you're paying for that pop 

780
00:34:33,680 --> 00:34:37,070
that happens when the lighting change 
happens and the show's about to start.

781
00:34:37,130 --> 00:34:38,210
You know what I mean?
Well,

782
00:34:38,211 --> 00:34:40,760
you just paying for all that energy 
because you don't get that.

783
00:34:40,761 --> 00:34:45,400
You get always a cheesy thing usually at
a comedy club coming up next week at the

784
00:34:45,410 --> 00:34:46,610
chuggle hood.
You know what I mean?

785
00:34:46,611 --> 00:34:50,090
Almost every decent parking validation 
available.

786
00:34:50,510 --> 00:34:53,450
They always have weird announcements.
Is there a chuckle hut by the way?

787
00:34:53,750 --> 00:34:54,583
It must be.
I don't think so because that's the fun 

788
00:34:56,710 --> 00:34:59,060
of everyone's jokes.
What did they say?

789
00:34:59,061 --> 00:35:01,670
Everybody says uncle fuckers chuckle.
Hut,

790
00:35:01,671 --> 00:35:03,210
right?
That's what everybody says.

791
00:35:03,211 --> 00:35:05,230
Oh No.
I've just always chuckle.

792
00:35:05,240 --> 00:35:08,340
Head is like what I picture like the 
worst comedy club that sound like,

793
00:35:10,770 --> 00:35:11,603
oh yeah man.
Those things are so important though 

794
00:35:13,710 --> 00:35:15,090
that without those clubs.
Look,

795
00:35:15,580 --> 00:35:16,413
I've had this conversation with club 
owners before to like give my thanks 

796
00:35:20,060 --> 00:35:20,893
because I think there's a lot,
there's a combative relationship that 

797
00:35:22,451 --> 00:35:24,580
happens between a lot of comics and club
owners,

798
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:25,713
you know,
they're trying to fuck us and because 

799
00:35:26,891 --> 00:35:29,020
everybody has a story,
right?

800
00:35:29,500 --> 00:35:32,950
Everybody has a story where a club owner
fucked you over or something happened.

801
00:35:32,980 --> 00:35:36,910
Everybody has a story and so in the 
beginning it's hard to get booked,

802
00:35:36,911 --> 00:35:37,744
so developed a sort of contentious 
relationship with them in the first 

803
00:35:39,451 --> 00:35:42,270
place because they don't want to use you
because you're not really that good.

804
00:35:42,271 --> 00:35:43,104
Then things start going for you and then
you start selling tickets and then you 

805
00:35:45,481 --> 00:35:47,850
think they're not giving you enough 
because you sell too many tickets.

806
00:35:47,851 --> 00:35:50,910
Then eventually you realized somewhere 
along the line.

807
00:35:51,240 --> 00:35:55,890
I think hopefully eventually I did at 
least that the fucking need those people

808
00:35:55,990 --> 00:35:58,260
like without them,
there's no art form.

809
00:35:58,470 --> 00:36:02,130
Like we need a place to practice.
This isn't like music.

810
00:36:02,131 --> 00:36:02,964
This isn't like writing.
Like we have to go in front of those 

811
00:36:05,221 --> 00:36:07,200
fucking people and we're not going to do
it ourselves.

812
00:36:07,740 --> 00:36:08,640
You know?
We're just the.

813
00:36:08,790 --> 00:36:09,623
Especially the funny ones,
you think Louis Ck is gonna open up a 

814
00:36:11,911 --> 00:36:12,744
comedy club comedy club and Bill Burr 
Bill Berg and open up a fucking laugh 

815
00:36:15,751 --> 00:36:17,050
factory.
No.

816
00:36:17,930 --> 00:36:19,980
Are you going to open up a comedy club?
No,

817
00:36:20,070 --> 00:36:20,910
no,
no.

818
00:36:20,940 --> 00:36:21,773
No.
One is.

819
00:36:21,990 --> 00:36:23,190
So you need those fucking people.

820
00:36:23,390 --> 00:36:25,850
Yeah.
It's crazy because like,

821
00:36:25,950 --> 00:36:27,360
you know,
without.

822
00:36:27,780 --> 00:36:28,613
And it's also amazing how each club has 
their own different vibe and totally 

823
00:36:32,611 --> 00:36:34,290
different DNA.
There's no,

824
00:36:34,590 --> 00:36:38,270
I mean other than the Improv's,
which you know are the Improv.

825
00:36:40,140 --> 00:36:40,973
Yeah.
I figured out a way to make them all 

826
00:36:41,541 --> 00:36:42,374
feel the same.

827
00:36:42,420 --> 00:36:43,253
I think that's it and I don't like that.
I mean I enjoy my time in the southern 

828
00:36:47,311 --> 00:36:49,410
California Improv's when I performed 
there,

829
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:51,720
but like,
here's a thing.

830
00:36:51,740 --> 00:36:52,790
No,
it's not bad.

831
00:36:52,820 --> 00:36:55,760
It's not a bad feeling.
Like if you go to do the Tempe Improv,

832
00:36:55,761 --> 00:36:58,080
even though it feels like all the Improv
is a fucking great clubs.

833
00:36:58,081 --> 00:36:59,570
Yeah.
Same thing with all of them.

834
00:36:59,600 --> 00:37:02,480
They figured out how to do it right 
because you go to every place.

835
00:37:02,481 --> 00:37:06,110
It's almost all the same experience.
It's a good experience and then it just,

836
00:37:06,111 --> 00:37:09,230
they leave it up to the stand up so they
have everything down in between,

837
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:11,660
but it feels very different than say if 
you go to Zane,

838
00:37:11,661 --> 00:37:13,370
he's in Nashville.
Exactly.

839
00:37:13,371 --> 00:37:18,010
That's a club that's been in that form 
for 30 years or something like that.

840
00:37:18,030 --> 00:37:18,863
It's an amazing spot.
This ancient headshots in the world on 

841
00:37:21,771 --> 00:37:24,830
the wall where half the people are dead,
you know,

842
00:37:25,370 --> 00:37:26,960
love that.
That's a different vibe.

843
00:37:26,961 --> 00:37:28,050
Right?
Or the Ice House.

844
00:37:28,080 --> 00:37:31,070
That's a totally different vibe.
That's a non corporate vibe.

845
00:37:31,580 --> 00:37:33,440
That's like a holy shit.
Look at this gym,

846
00:37:33,560 --> 00:37:34,620
you know?
I love that place.

847
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:38,180
St e's in Chicago,
Portland,

848
00:37:38,181 --> 00:37:39,020
helium,
Denver,

849
00:37:39,021 --> 00:37:39,854
comedy works.

850
00:37:40,770 --> 00:37:42,780
All those places.
Helium and Philly.

851
00:37:43,370 --> 00:37:43,980
Yeah.
That's great.

852
00:37:43,980 --> 00:37:46,110
Yeah.
All those clubs are like these.

853
00:37:46,170 --> 00:37:47,003
Almost like a mom and pop organization,
if you had to look at it that way 

854
00:37:49,980 --> 00:37:51,630
because they're.
They're a small business.

855
00:37:51,631 --> 00:37:54,250
It's a small business that caters to 
live comedy.

856
00:37:54,280 --> 00:37:55,200
Without it,
we're fucked.

857
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:56,273
Look what happened in Houston.
The last stop in river oaks closed down 

858
00:37:59,431 --> 00:38:01,320
in Houston and so did the scene.
I mean,

859
00:38:01,321 --> 00:38:02,154
I know there's some guys out there and I
don't want them to feel bad that I'm 

860
00:38:03,840 --> 00:38:04,673
shitting on it.
I'm not shitting on Houston and there's 

861
00:38:05,670 --> 00:38:07,920
a lot of great comics came out of there,
you know,

862
00:38:07,921 --> 00:38:09,690
a lot of our friends came out of there,
Maddie Kirsch.

863
00:38:09,950 --> 00:38:10,783
Um,
but what happened was they had this 

864
00:38:13,500 --> 00:38:18,150
powerful fucking scene.
It was like everybody thought about,

865
00:38:18,330 --> 00:38:20,910
you thought about La,
thought about New York,

866
00:38:20,911 --> 00:38:21,744
you thought about Boston and San 
Francisco and you thought about fucking 

867
00:38:23,821 --> 00:38:24,570
Houston.

868
00:38:24,570 --> 00:38:25,403
Houston was a real scene man.
They had kinison and Hicks and it was 

869
00:38:29,221 --> 00:38:30,054
like they had a whole thing going on.
And when we came along I came along and 

870
00:38:33,181 --> 00:38:36,640
I started working there in the late 
nineties and it was still echoing.

871
00:38:36,641 --> 00:38:38,410
It was like they,
the Hicks was dead.

872
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:41,870
Tennyson was dead,
but there was like this bar,

873
00:38:43,120 --> 00:38:47,560
just the last reverberations of the 
echoes of that crew,

874
00:38:47,590 --> 00:38:50,770
Jimmy Pineapple and all these guys that 
came through with him and,

875
00:38:50,771 --> 00:38:51,604
uh,
the outlaws of comedy that they used to 

876
00:38:52,361 --> 00:38:53,194
call themselves.
And they were like looking for the next 

877
00:38:54,581 --> 00:38:56,740
ones.
Was there in Austin scene back then?

878
00:38:57,280 --> 00:38:58,113
Yes,
there was,

879
00:38:58,290 --> 00:39:00,190
there was always a scene and very smart 
seen.

880
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:02,200
Austin has always been thought of as 
like a,

881
00:39:02,201 --> 00:39:04,060
a smart place,
you know,

882
00:39:04,061 --> 00:39:07,720
like because of the universities there 
and it's like a real liberal town,

883
00:39:07,721 --> 00:39:08,554
a smart towns.
The velveeta room came along and when 

884
00:39:10,391 --> 00:39:11,800
they were.
When did they start out?

885
00:39:12,390 --> 00:39:13,223
I tell you what though.
Houston has got a new up and coming 

886
00:39:15,180 --> 00:39:16,013
that,
that new club that opened up the secret 

887
00:39:17,191 --> 00:39:19,080
group.
When did they open up?

888
00:39:19,350 --> 00:39:20,250
Just this year.
We.

889
00:39:20,280 --> 00:39:21,001
Excellent.
Yeah,

890
00:39:21,001 --> 00:39:24,140
it was amazing.
They did an entire festival in like it's

891
00:39:24,150 --> 00:39:28,710
this multi room to like super warehouse 
and they have an outdoor parking lot and

892
00:39:28,711 --> 00:39:29,544
they put a huge outdoor tent so we were 
doing like kill Tony in one room while 

893
00:39:32,791 --> 00:39:37,791
Joey and sold out big ass warehouse,
like a fucking rave version of kill Tony

894
00:39:38,550 --> 00:39:41,790
and outside in this big open field under
a huge tent.

895
00:39:41,820 --> 00:39:42,653
Joey Diaz just fucking,
I mean this place has so many rooms and 

896
00:39:47,461 --> 00:39:50,580
I do believe it or lots of comics that 
got together and bought it.

897
00:39:51,120 --> 00:39:51,953
They have a club too.
It's called the secret group and that's 

898
00:39:53,740 --> 00:39:57,300
perfect with a bomb ass,
huge green room in the middle,

899
00:39:57,301 --> 00:39:58,410
like off,
you know,

900
00:39:58,440 --> 00:40:00,870
but everybody's going to do there.
There's different shows,

901
00:40:00,871 --> 00:40:01,590
different room.

902
00:40:01,590 --> 00:40:05,580
That sort of proves my point that you 
need a club because the Houston scene,

903
00:40:05,610 --> 00:40:06,443
they opened up an Improv there,
but you know with Improv's the same 

904
00:40:08,731 --> 00:40:10,500
thing we were talking about,
it's a corporate environment.

905
00:40:10,501 --> 00:40:11,334
It's a totally different thing.
You're not going to have a bunch of 

906
00:40:12,151 --> 00:40:12,984
people hanging around.
They probably don't have an open mic 

907
00:40:14,761 --> 00:40:15,960
night.
If they do,

908
00:40:15,961 --> 00:40:18,600
it's probably not that big of a deal.
It's hard to get work.

909
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:19,793
Like one of the things about the really 
good places is you can actually start 

910
00:40:21,931 --> 00:40:24,000
out there and then work,
you know,

911
00:40:24,001 --> 00:40:26,760
like a comedy works like Wendy as a 
whole system.

912
00:40:26,761 --> 00:40:31,110
You started out there as a open miker.
You develop your act and they let you mc

913
00:40:31,111 --> 00:40:31,944
on shows.
They teach how to bring people up to 

914
00:40:33,541 --> 00:40:36,360
teach you how to middle than you learn 
how to headline and then all of a sudden

915
00:40:36,361 --> 00:40:37,194
you're on the road.

916
00:40:37,330 --> 00:40:39,450
You can actually become a comic and you 
can get paid there.

917
00:40:39,451 --> 00:40:40,284
She has like local headliners that,
that started out in her club that'll 

918
00:40:42,781 --> 00:40:46,290
come down there and do a week and sell 
tickets like people know who they are.

919
00:40:46,291 --> 00:40:48,270
People in the town.
She's a beast.

920
00:40:48,560 --> 00:40:50,450
Yeah man.
You need a club and need a club.

921
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:51,750
You need cloud are,
you know,

922
00:40:52,350 --> 00:40:55,680
looking at this place the greatest of 
all time.

923
00:40:55,770 --> 00:40:58,200
We've got to paint this room black 
because we're going to do more of.

924
00:40:58,201 --> 00:40:59,034
These are going to paint these room 
black and I'm going to put blue leds 

925
00:41:01,561 --> 00:41:02,910
behind the comedy store.
Like,

926
00:41:03,170 --> 00:41:03,480
like,
uh,

927
00:41:03,480 --> 00:41:04,760
Mexicans low rider.

928
00:41:04,920 --> 00:41:06,120
Yeah.
They have those things up.

929
00:41:06,130 --> 00:41:06,870
I tell you what,
uh,

930
00:41:06,870 --> 00:41:07,703
you know,
Hugh,

931
00:41:08,020 --> 00:41:09,450
I think it's Phillips Hue.
Uh,

932
00:41:09,451 --> 00:41:12,420
you can get a lot of light bulbs and 
then control it with apps and change all

933
00:41:12,421 --> 00:41:13,254
the different colors.
They have the New Light Light Stir 

934
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:16,480
protuse,
uh,

935
00:41:16,530 --> 00:41:19,670
which are so bright,
but it can change any color you want.

936
00:41:19,671 --> 00:41:20,504
And just sit there and go like,
I went purple behind the comedy store 

937
00:41:22,561 --> 00:41:23,520
right now.
Interesting.

938
00:41:23,550 --> 00:41:24,510
It's great.
Check it out.

939
00:41:24,660 --> 00:41:26,240
I think it should be blue though.
For what?

940
00:41:26,280 --> 00:41:28,260
To make an act.
You want leave it blue.

941
00:41:28,380 --> 00:41:30,510
I'm just thinking about a foot and if 
you have a black wall,

942
00:41:30,511 --> 00:41:31,590
but the red behind it.

943
00:41:34,260 --> 00:41:36,230
That's right,
because that's the light.

944
00:41:36,250 --> 00:41:37,780
Yeah,
and we put the light on what?

945
00:41:37,781 --> 00:41:40,340
We're going to end the podcast.
It's like the red light,

946
00:41:41,060 --> 00:41:41,781
like,
oh my God,

947
00:41:41,781 --> 00:41:44,200
the light is on time.
As I wrap it up,

948
00:41:44,450 --> 00:41:46,070
we found it.
That's it.

949
00:41:46,071 --> 00:41:47,030
That's what we're gonna do.
Okay,

950
00:41:47,031 --> 00:41:50,790
so that's fine.
We'll put a red led light behind it.

951
00:41:50,791 --> 00:41:51,624
We're going to paint this whole room 
black and we got to get rid of the 

952
00:41:53,970 --> 00:41:58,970
interrogation lighting.
This is the first 48.

953
00:42:00,430 --> 00:42:03,790
This is that room where people fuck up.
Don't talk even when they're guilty.

954
00:42:04,030 --> 00:42:07,640
Keep your mouth shut.
Why do I walk in and put a cigarette out

955
00:42:07,641 --> 00:42:10,700
on my forehead right now?
Whenever I watched those videos,

956
00:42:11,080 --> 00:42:13,970
tell the damn truth.
I always watched those videos.

957
00:42:13,971 --> 00:42:16,130
I hope those guys lie.
I hope they do a good job.

958
00:42:16,430 --> 00:42:16,971
Am I?
Come on.

959
00:42:16,971 --> 00:42:18,770
You can get out of this is really good 
at it.

960
00:42:18,840 --> 00:42:19,910
Do you know,
I mean I did.

961
00:42:19,930 --> 00:42:20,763
I tell you this,
that I've been watching those videos 

962
00:42:21,821 --> 00:42:23,620
lately,
real interrogation videos.

963
00:42:23,980 --> 00:42:24,813
It's interesting as fuck to me because 
either they break or they don't break 

964
00:42:29,140 --> 00:42:29,973
and

965
00:42:30,180 --> 00:42:30,871
yeah,
very rare.

966
00:42:30,871 --> 00:42:32,490
They don't break,
but when they don't break you have to be

967
00:42:32,491 --> 00:42:33,410
really worried,
but it's.

968
00:42:33,480 --> 00:42:35,310
Those are fucking sociopath.
That's exactly

969
00:42:35,410 --> 00:42:37,330
clean.
The interesting thing is when they don't

970
00:42:37,331 --> 00:42:39,850
break your even more amazed like,
Oh,

971
00:42:39,851 --> 00:42:43,180
you evil motherfucker,
just able to stay so calm.

972
00:42:43,420 --> 00:42:44,620
You've got to look some of these up.

973
00:42:44,830 --> 00:42:45,663
My favorite is when they admit to a 
little bit of a lie and then they have 

974
00:42:48,971 --> 00:42:49,804
to correct their store and then you see 
him like four hours later and they just 

975
00:42:53,921 --> 00:42:54,754
beat these dudes down.
They keep talking to them hour after 

976
00:42:57,110 --> 00:42:58,540
hour after hour,
which should be,

977
00:42:58,541 --> 00:42:59,374
by the way,
totally illegal because you leave me in 

978
00:43:01,751 --> 00:43:02,584
a room for fucking six hours.
If I think that I'm going to get to a 

979
00:43:04,781 --> 00:43:07,510
bed and six hours,
I'll start confessing to shit.

980
00:43:07,570 --> 00:43:09,060
Like that's when people do like,
yeah,

981
00:43:09,061 --> 00:43:11,260
okay,
I fucking stabbed him.

982
00:43:11,290 --> 00:43:12,400
Can I go to sleep now?

983
00:43:13,010 --> 00:43:13,843
Explain.
Uh,

984
00:43:13,870 --> 00:43:17,470
yesterday got stuck on the tarmac in San
Francisco.

985
00:43:17,650 --> 00:43:18,940
Was It delta?
Yeah,

986
00:43:18,941 --> 00:43:21,400
it was.
It had nothing to do with delta.

987
00:43:21,401 --> 00:43:22,234
It was a,
there was a ground stoppage for the 

988
00:43:23,261 --> 00:43:24,094
first time in a very long time at lax,
which means any flights that are about 

989
00:43:27,311 --> 00:43:28,144
to leave from anywhere automatically 
delayed until further notice because 

990
00:43:30,941 --> 00:43:31,774
they were the cause of whether they were
at full ground stoppage and about the 

991
00:43:35,831 --> 00:43:37,870
interrogation thing.
I'm on the tarmac.

992
00:43:38,040 --> 00:43:38,873
They,
the delay was four hours and I was 

993
00:43:41,051 --> 00:43:44,470
literally fighting back tears.
I was breaking as a human.

994
00:43:44,760 --> 00:43:46,500
Yeah.
You were crying about the rain.

995
00:43:46,710 --> 00:43:49,020
You were upstairs crying about the rain 
during killed Tony.

996
00:43:49,050 --> 00:43:51,360
We had a massive drought.
People are dying.

997
00:43:51,480 --> 00:43:56,480
There's no waterfield babies die.
Nobody's dying from this drought.

998
00:43:56,650 --> 00:43:59,190
You know how many people died just 
yesterday for hurricanes.

999
00:44:00,740 --> 00:44:02,460
Tornadoes to or.
Yeah,

1000
00:44:02,461 --> 00:44:03,300
maybe.
Tornadoes,

1001
00:44:03,660 --> 00:44:04,650
tornadoes,
hurricanes.

1002
00:44:04,980 --> 00:44:05,830
One of those.
Yeah.

1003
00:44:05,840 --> 00:44:08,220
Atlanta.
Atlanta got hurricanes.

1004
00:44:08,221 --> 00:44:10,950
They know it's coming.
If you get fucked up by hurricane,

1005
00:44:11,250 --> 00:44:13,170
either you're really poor or you're 
really stupid.

1006
00:44:13,590 --> 00:44:15,300
Right?
But if you get fucked up by a tornado,

1007
00:44:15,301 --> 00:44:16,134
you just got shit.

1008
00:44:16,260 --> 00:44:19,350
They said that 18 people died in Atlanta
or whatever that was,

1009
00:44:19,351 --> 00:44:23,310
but I looked it up in like 12 of them or
10 or 16 something.

1010
00:44:23,311 --> 00:44:26,310
There was a very high number of the 
people were all at one trailer park.

1011
00:44:26,311 --> 00:44:31,050
That basically just got like squished.
I thought that was crazy.

1012
00:44:31,200 --> 00:44:32,100
It was like whatever I'm in.

1013
00:44:32,100 --> 00:44:32,933
I am just trying to guess here,
but out of the 18 people that died in 

1014
00:44:35,371 --> 00:44:36,204
Atlanta,
12 of them is my final answer on the 

1015
00:44:37,900 --> 00:44:40,440
guests all from the same trailer park 
and I was thinking like,

1016
00:44:40,441 --> 00:44:43,050
what the fuck had to happen to this 
trailer park?

1017
00:44:43,051 --> 00:44:45,140
I didn't really get to figure it out.
They didn't have much detail.

1018
00:44:45,141 --> 00:44:46,440
There's been some towns

1019
00:44:46,520 --> 00:44:49,010
I think I want to say Jasper,
Missouri,

1020
00:44:49,670 --> 00:44:50,503
maybe that's one of those towns that was
literally wiped off the map by 

1021
00:44:54,381 --> 00:44:58,380
tornadoes.
Tornadoes came in like a gigantic eraser

1022
00:44:58,730 --> 00:44:59,563
and you talking about like hundreds of 
yards wide and just destroyed 

1023
00:45:02,660 --> 00:45:05,540
everything.
Just clean the entire top off.

1024
00:45:05,541 --> 00:45:09,630
Killed everyone that was there and just 
through the building through.

1025
00:45:09,970 --> 00:45:12,500
There was nothing left.
Annihilated the whole town.

1026
00:45:12,501 --> 00:45:15,230
There's a before and after.
Photo might not be Jasper.

1027
00:45:15,231 --> 00:45:16,600
I forget what the name of this town.

1028
00:45:16,750 --> 00:45:18,280
Oklahoma,
Kansas City.

1029
00:45:18,610 --> 00:45:21,100
It sounds about right.
It's all in that same area.

1030
00:45:21,101 --> 00:45:22,570
There's definitely in misery though.

1031
00:45:22,570 --> 00:45:23,890
Why am I saying Jasper,
Missouri?

1032
00:45:23,920 --> 00:45:24,581
I don't know.
I don't know.

1033
00:45:24,581 --> 00:45:25,570
I'm going to be right.
Jasper,

1034
00:45:25,610 --> 00:45:28,060
wherever the fuck it was that this 
happened.

1035
00:45:28,061 --> 00:45:29,840
Whatever this town was.
Um,

1036
00:45:30,250 --> 00:45:31,083
I had no idea.
I thought they would come down and just 

1037
00:45:32,981 --> 00:45:34,930
fuck up a few houses.
I never knew.

1038
00:45:34,931 --> 00:45:36,880
They occasionally killed the whole town.

1039
00:45:37,910 --> 00:45:39,710
Twister was on at the hotel the other 
day.

1040
00:45:39,711 --> 00:45:43,730
Remember that movie?
It does not hold up.

1041
00:45:43,820 --> 00:45:46,940
It was pretty entertaining.
The very high.

1042
00:45:47,810 --> 00:45:48,643
I'll tell you this,
there was one part which I noticed in 

1043
00:45:50,151 --> 00:45:51,710
which I'm like,
go fuck yourself.

1044
00:45:51,711 --> 00:45:52,544
There was a,
there was a member of the part where 

1045
00:45:53,091 --> 00:45:55,670
Helen Hunt gets out when all the balls 
drop out of the machine.

1046
00:45:55,671 --> 00:45:56,301
She's like,
no,

1047
00:45:56,301 --> 00:45:57,134
go ahead.
I'm going to put the balls back in like 

1048
00:46:00,171 --> 00:46:02,840
an f five tornado right next to the 
student.

1049
00:46:02,950 --> 00:46:03,783
Embarrassing.
There are parts in old movies that just 

1050
00:46:06,441 --> 00:46:07,340
wreck it.
All.

1051
00:46:07,850 --> 00:46:08,683
That one scene is so unbelievable now.
For some reason that it ruins the whole 

1052
00:46:13,101 --> 00:46:13,934
entire movie.

1053
00:46:14,010 --> 00:46:14,401
Yeah.
No,

1054
00:46:14,401 --> 00:46:16,890
it wasn't Jasper.
Yeah,

1055
00:46:16,891 --> 00:46:17,330
it was.
Uh,

1056
00:46:17,330 --> 00:46:18,390
it was.
Yeah,

1057
00:46:18,430 --> 00:46:20,810
it was an f category five hurricane.

1058
00:46:21,120 --> 00:46:21,953
Those,
that fives or the ones catastrophic 

1059
00:46:23,701 --> 00:46:25,630
damage.
Yeah.

1060
00:46:25,860 --> 00:46:26,693
I was so obsessed with a and afraid.
I was definitely afraid of tornadoes 

1061
00:46:30,181 --> 00:46:32,820
when I was a kid.
There was a whole period for a few years

1062
00:46:32,821 --> 00:46:35,040
where it's Joplin,
Joplin,

1063
00:46:35,041 --> 00:46:36,480
Missouri.
That's where I fucked up.

1064
00:46:36,481 --> 00:46:37,500
But look,
that's the town.

1065
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:39,110
Whoa.

1066
00:46:40,870 --> 00:46:42,070
Not Jasper.
Joplin.

1067
00:46:42,100 --> 00:46:46,660
If you look at it is nothing.
It is annihilated.

1068
00:46:47,170 --> 00:46:48,003
It's fucking crazy.
And that was an f five that was like as 

1069
00:46:51,581 --> 00:46:53,380
high as it gets.
Right?

1070
00:46:53,381 --> 00:46:56,590
Is that as high as it gets?
Two point $2,000,000,000

1071
00:46:56,591 --> 00:46:58,540
in damage.
Holy Shit.

1072
00:46:59,050 --> 00:47:01,870
Two point $2,000,000,000
in damage.

1073
00:47:01,900 --> 00:47:03,540
That is insane.
GC,

1074
00:47:03,550 --> 00:47:04,383
that house for sale in Los Angeles is 
like the most expensive house in ever 

1075
00:47:08,030 --> 00:47:10,800
worried was the one in Bel Air.
That's like $500 dollars.

1076
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:13,300
And it comes with a helicopter and a 
car.

1077
00:47:13,380 --> 00:47:16,110
A classic car collection.
I don't know if it does.

1078
00:47:16,330 --> 00:47:17,163
I promise it.
Really?

1079
00:47:17,170 --> 00:47:18,110
Yeah.
No,

1080
00:47:18,120 --> 00:47:19,320
Jamie.
Jamie could tell you.

1081
00:47:19,350 --> 00:47:21,810
It comes with a helicopter,
a real house though.

1082
00:47:21,840 --> 00:47:25,230
Look at this house because it's got all 
the things that are a house,

1083
00:47:25,231 --> 00:47:28,500
but it's not made for people to live in.
It's like a party place.

1084
00:47:28,710 --> 00:47:29,980
So it's for someone who doesn't want

1085
00:47:29,980 --> 00:47:33,190
to live here for the one weekend.
I mean,

1086
00:47:33,191 --> 00:47:34,024
how many bathrooms does it have as many 
six bathrooms and wanting to do the 

1087
00:47:37,330 --> 00:47:39,940
town.
Some bitches like God.

1088
00:47:40,600 --> 00:47:45,600
Isn't it weird that a car survive but 
not the whole town credit for those that

1089
00:47:46,991 --> 00:47:51,520
either can't see the image of Joplin.
It looks like the inside of old.

1090
00:47:51,521 --> 00:47:56,190
A pencil sharpeners.
I mean it's just insane.

1091
00:47:56,510 --> 00:48:00,550
This house comes with a $30 million 
dollar car collection to $30,000,000

1092
00:48:00,551 --> 00:48:02,860
car collection.
A bargain.

1093
00:48:03,280 --> 00:48:04,900
So then what's that?
Number four.

1094
00:48:04,901 --> 00:48:05,734
It doesn't make any sense.
They're saying like how much for a week 

1095
00:48:09,251 --> 00:48:10,084
and it also comes with seven full time 
staffers to help tend the two mass own 

1096
00:48:13,620 --> 00:48:15,510
them.
I own this stuff.

1097
00:48:16,060 --> 00:48:19,500
I can fuck yes or no.
I can fuck this stuff.

1098
00:48:22,830 --> 00:48:24,340
Good stuff.
I can fuck.

1099
00:48:24,380 --> 00:48:25,213
Yeah,
there's definitely you to have some 

1100
00:48:25,691 --> 00:48:26,524
hookers.
What's the airbnb on this place for the 

1101
00:48:29,021 --> 00:48:31,600
night?
I left too much for you.

1102
00:48:33,250 --> 00:48:34,083
Comes with all the pussy you want.
Tony spent the rest of his money on one 

1103
00:48:37,361 --> 00:48:38,500
night,
one night.

1104
00:48:38,730 --> 00:48:43,510
The AIRBNB,
airbnb.

1105
00:48:43,780 --> 00:48:45,700
Because there's dudes out there that are
balling so hard.

1106
00:48:45,701 --> 00:48:47,080
We don't know about it.
You know,

1107
00:48:47,081 --> 00:48:49,900
there's some royal family members that 
are worth trillions of dollars.

1108
00:48:50,170 --> 00:48:52,960
Did you know that when you hear about 
like the richest man in the world,

1109
00:48:52,961 --> 00:48:53,441
you are,
wow,

1110
00:48:53,441 --> 00:48:54,850
what's it like to have $90,
million?

1111
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:56,950
That's not the richest band in the 
world.

1112
00:48:56,980 --> 00:49:01,510
It's not the richest man in the world is
a guy that you don't even know those oil

1113
00:49:01,511 --> 00:49:02,344
dudes like those dudes in,
in Saudi Arabia and the Middle East 

1114
00:49:06,041 --> 00:49:06,851
that,
you know,

1115
00:49:06,851 --> 00:49:08,290
oligarchs,
he's,

1116
00:49:08,350 --> 00:49:09,183
they have monarchies.
They have these fucking gigantic piles 

1117
00:49:12,671 --> 00:49:14,860
of wealth that you can't even wrap your 
brain around.

1118
00:49:15,220 --> 00:49:17,590
Trillions,
trillions,

1119
00:49:17,740 --> 00:49:20,050
thousands of billions

1120
00:49:20,810 --> 00:49:22,400
really have you.
You know this?

1121
00:49:22,630 --> 00:49:23,780
Oh this,

1122
00:49:24,150 --> 00:49:27,840
yes.
Thousands of billions.

1123
00:49:28,770 --> 00:49:29,910
Do you know,
started the salt.

1124
00:49:29,911 --> 00:49:32,250
No.
Dubai Sultan of Brunei rather.

1125
00:49:32,490 --> 00:49:33,840
No soul,
no Bernai.

1126
00:49:34,250 --> 00:49:38,370
Um,
he would bring in gals and pay them like

1127
00:49:38,371 --> 00:49:39,600
$50,000
a month,

1128
00:49:40,370 --> 00:49:42,720
just come on down and they would go for 
a few months,

1129
00:49:42,721 --> 00:49:43,554
make quarter million bucks,
then fly home and you'd get all this 

1130
00:49:45,661 --> 00:49:46,494
jewelry and diamonds and shit.
And one little hook ruined the whole 

1131
00:49:49,411 --> 00:49:50,244
Party.
But she was the quarter with a laptop 

1132
00:49:51,920 --> 00:49:52,753
straightened stories about it.
She wanted to write a book about her 

1133
00:49:56,281 --> 00:49:57,390
experience.
So this dude,

1134
00:49:57,450 --> 00:49:58,283
this is what he would do.
He had a disco in his house and one of 

1135
00:49:59,761 --> 00:50:00,594
his many houses and uh,
he would have it filled with all these 

1136
00:50:03,691 --> 00:50:05,400
girls are making who knows how much 
money,

1137
00:50:05,401 --> 00:50:06,234
just tens of thousands of dollars and he
would come out and he's fucking gold 

1138
00:50:09,181 --> 00:50:12,870
underwear and just in slippers.
And you slide across the room.

1139
00:50:13,080 --> 00:50:15,450
Like he was in that scene with Tom 
Cruise.

1140
00:50:15,600 --> 00:50:16,433
What's that movie?
Risky business play slides in slide in 

1141
00:50:19,411 --> 00:50:22,250
like that as gold underwear.
And just go eeny meeny,

1142
00:50:22,251 --> 00:50:22,971
miny,
moe,

1143
00:50:22,971 --> 00:50:27,950
and just pick one out and just fuck the 
out of own.

1144
00:50:28,310 --> 00:50:31,370
And then the next day do the same thing.
And He'd do whatever he wants.

1145
00:50:31,490 --> 00:50:36,490
And that chick wrote the story on it,
one of them did and there was like,

1146
00:50:37,730 --> 00:50:38,310
so what

1147
00:50:38,310 --> 00:50:40,540
I'm going back on this is that had 
known.

1148
00:50:40,650 --> 00:50:43,180
That's really him.
Pack Reagan.

1149
00:50:44,470 --> 00:50:45,590
Meanie miny.
Mo.

1150
00:50:46,090 --> 00:50:47,920
That guy's totally covered in gold.
Look aT him.

1151
00:50:48,430 --> 00:50:50,250
That guy's worth more money than you can
I.

1152
00:50:50,490 --> 00:50:52,290
Can I be one of these girls?
I'm like,

1153
00:50:52,770 --> 00:50:53,603
go away for 50,000.
I'm doing a gig in dubai guys for a 

1154
00:50:55,950 --> 00:50:56,080
whole month.

1155
00:50:56,080 --> 00:50:59,920
You just want to be the court jester.
Go over there and crack some jokes,

1156
00:51:00,160 --> 00:51:02,980
man.
That's fucking crazy.

1157
00:51:03,130 --> 00:51:05,560
You think he wears a condom?
No,

1158
00:51:05,950 --> 00:51:07,570
no condom.
Shut up.

1159
00:51:08,140 --> 00:51:09,250
You want to do that?
Yeah,

1160
00:51:09,251 --> 00:51:11,530
exactly.
He's just shooting loads of these gals.

1161
00:51:11,830 --> 00:51:12,340
But

1162
00:51:12,340 --> 00:51:13,173
then again,
he's opening himseLf up for possible 

1163
00:51:14,991 --> 00:51:15,850
does.
I wonder if they.

1164
00:51:16,930 --> 00:51:18,300
I bet he gets them tested.

1165
00:51:18,350 --> 00:51:20,430
It puts them in catapults and shoots him
in the air.

1166
00:51:21,030 --> 00:51:24,780
What does that giant throne looking at 
his throne?

1167
00:51:24,840 --> 00:51:26,520
Oh my god.
That's insane.

1168
00:51:26,540 --> 00:51:27,373
Look at them.
Sit there and he's covered with this 

1169
00:51:28,711 --> 00:51:30,960
thing that looks like something that 
belongs inside the pyramids.

1170
00:51:31,400 --> 00:51:33,810
It looks like a sunglass hut in 
glendale.

1171
00:51:33,860 --> 00:51:35,670
So everything is gold.
Do do you understand that?

1172
00:51:35,671 --> 00:51:38,340
That's real gold,
like everything is gold plated,

1173
00:51:38,341 --> 00:51:40,650
everything.
Real gold plated everything.

1174
00:51:40,651 --> 00:51:41,910
Everywhere you look,
gold,

1175
00:51:41,911 --> 00:51:42,511
gold,
gold,

1176
00:51:42,511 --> 00:51:43,344
gold,
gold

1177
00:51:43,890 --> 00:51:46,680
goal,
second set cookies,

1178
00:51:49,740 --> 00:51:50,900
cake,
cake,

1179
00:51:51,410 --> 00:51:52,610
cake.
For your birthday,

1180
00:51:54,190 --> 00:51:56,340
dude.
That's all from oil money.

1181
00:51:56,510 --> 00:51:59,130
Yeah.
They have a different kind of money,

1182
00:51:59,131 --> 00:52:00,990
man.
It's a different level of money.

1183
00:52:01,230 --> 00:52:02,063
See,
we have this idea that like bill gates 

1184
00:52:03,331 --> 00:52:04,620
and warren buffet.
Shit,

1185
00:52:04,621 --> 00:52:06,300
the fuck outta here.
Those guys are broke.

1186
00:52:06,750 --> 00:52:08,520
They're broken.
Comparison to this dude.

1187
00:52:08,890 --> 00:52:11,580
You know donald trump's worth 
$4,000,000,000.

1188
00:52:11,850 --> 00:52:15,390
That fucking guy is laughing.
if you gave him only $4,000,000,000,

1189
00:52:15,391 --> 00:52:19,100
he would start crying if he found out 
all he has left is $4,000,000,000.

1190
00:52:19,110 --> 00:52:24,110
If you go what?
What would fall to his knees?

1191
00:52:25,650 --> 00:52:29,370
How has god cursed me with only 
$4,000,000,000?

1192
00:52:29,490 --> 00:52:33,960
His plane has that us a vIrtual floor so
you can see what you're flying over.

1193
00:52:33,990 --> 00:52:36,360
Of course it does.
Of course it does.

1194
00:52:36,600 --> 00:52:37,433
Hashtag wow.
Hashtag balling out of control like our 

1195
00:52:41,131 --> 00:52:44,290
ideas of catastrophic wealth.
We,

1196
00:52:44,320 --> 00:52:45,153
we,
we are so sheltered from the true 

1197
00:52:46,381 --> 00:52:47,214
catastrophic wealth because if we were 
really exposed to it and we really 

1198
00:52:49,651 --> 00:52:51,660
understood it and then we understood 
where it came from,

1199
00:52:51,840 --> 00:52:52,673
we'd understand what the fuck is going 
on in the world and how bizarre the 

1200
00:52:56,001 --> 00:52:56,834
system of government we have that 
supports this and allows this kind of 

1201
00:53:00,181 --> 00:53:01,000
shit to happen.

1202
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:02,410
Let me ask you a question.
Please do.

1203
00:53:02,590 --> 00:53:05,140
You're hanging out one day,
all of a sudden your phone rings,

1204
00:53:05,350 --> 00:53:07,390
right?
You're sItting there cutting up some elk

1205
00:53:07,391 --> 00:53:10,510
and some jalapenos and you're slicing up
some avocado.

1206
00:53:10,511 --> 00:53:13,300
late night your phone rings and all of a
sudden you hear,

1207
00:53:13,330 --> 00:53:14,163
hello,
joe does me the salt and I heard the 

1208
00:53:16,570 --> 00:53:21,230
talk about the podcast and I will fight 
you over to a Saudi Arabia.

1209
00:53:21,231 --> 00:53:22,064
I'll send the plane.

1210
00:53:22,360 --> 00:53:24,010
How many hours do you have?
Really?

1211
00:53:24,170 --> 00:53:25,920
Because I heard you have 150 ferrari's.

1212
00:53:27,590 --> 00:53:28,423
Ferrari's is.
Yeah,

1213
00:53:29,250 --> 00:53:30,083
I might.
He might get mad at me for saying only 

1214
00:53:31,111 --> 00:53:33,660
150 probably might be a thousand 
ferrari's.

1215
00:53:33,870 --> 00:53:34,703
Like for real.
He's got one of the most ridiculous car 

1216
00:53:36,661 --> 00:53:38,190
collections the world's ever known.

1217
00:53:38,940 --> 00:53:41,580
How would you go visit him if he sent 
the plane for you?

1218
00:53:43,440 --> 00:53:47,890
Reported over 300 ferrari's.
300 for come out too.

1219
00:53:47,990 --> 00:53:50,710
Drive my ferrari.
We'll do a podcast,

1220
00:53:50,720 --> 00:53:51,940
steven outside

1221
00:53:52,890 --> 00:53:54,770
too,
but I got a podcast with bill barr.

1222
00:53:55,410 --> 00:53:56,820
I can't.
Okay.

1223
00:53:56,830 --> 00:53:59,830
Well how many?
300 followers.

1224
00:53:59,980 --> 00:54:00,813
She's got over $5,000
cars and three a reported over 300 

1225
00:54:05,011 --> 00:54:07,560
ferrari's.
He probably bought 300 new ones.

1226
00:54:07,620 --> 00:54:11,820
Jay leno just killed himself.
If you listened to jay leno's place is a

1227
00:54:11,821 --> 00:54:13,590
fucking riot.
Yeah,

1228
00:54:13,591 --> 00:54:14,424
right.
You've never been like if you get a 

1229
00:54:15,091 --> 00:54:19,740
chance someday and you know like one day
you get to be on jay leno's garage.

1230
00:54:19,950 --> 00:54:22,140
If you get a sick car,
get accustomed car,

1231
00:54:22,150 --> 00:54:22,983
something like that.
Take it just to go there or next time I 

1232
00:54:25,651 --> 00:54:26,490
go,
come with me.

1233
00:54:26,790 --> 00:54:28,410
You'll free.
It's right in your neighborhood,

1234
00:54:28,411 --> 00:54:29,460
man.
Burbank airport.

1235
00:54:30,480 --> 00:54:32,490
It's the craziest thing I've ever seen 
in my life.

1236
00:54:32,520 --> 00:54:36,000
He has 11 buildings,
warehouses filled with cars.

1237
00:54:36,170 --> 00:54:37,003
Like I thought it was like a warehouse.
I thought like jay leno's got this cool 

1238
00:54:39,331 --> 00:54:42,410
collection,
so warehouse filled with cars and no,

1239
00:54:42,420 --> 00:54:43,253
it's 11 warehouses and he can just jump 
in one and start it and your job where 

1240
00:54:46,860 --> 00:54:48,780
everyone works,
they have mechanics,

1241
00:54:49,200 --> 00:54:51,480
mechanics everywhere.
They take care of everythinG.

1242
00:54:51,900 --> 00:54:52,920
The whole thing.
Every.

1243
00:54:52,980 --> 00:54:55,020
Every car is functional anD he drives 
them all the time,

1244
00:54:55,021 --> 00:54:56,250
including like these 19.
Oh,

1245
00:54:56,251 --> 00:54:58,920
three tractors.
He put these things.

1246
00:54:59,070 --> 00:55:01,230
They have metal wheels.
They didn't have tires,

1247
00:55:01,290 --> 00:55:04,350
so he had rubber put on the outside of 
the metal so you could drive them on the

1248
00:55:04,351 --> 00:55:06,930
street and got them registered.
They're death traps.

1249
00:55:07,200 --> 00:55:10,110
There's no way you can stop.
There's no way you can take a corner.

1250
00:55:10,230 --> 00:55:12,420
I mean is the most ridiculous thing 
you've ever seen the.

1251
00:55:12,421 --> 00:55:13,254
Well,
but he drives it.

1252
00:55:13,260 --> 00:55:16,380
He tries it all his cars around burbank 
all the time.

1253
00:55:16,381 --> 00:55:19,140
You always seem like in a firetruck or 
like a lollipop.

1254
00:55:19,141 --> 00:55:22,500
It's got to be crazy for him.
Seeing seinfeld doing comedians in cars,

1255
00:55:22,501 --> 00:55:23,334
getting coffee and he's like,
I really missed an opportunity on that 

1256
00:55:25,920 --> 00:55:27,720
one.
You he's doing this.

1257
00:55:27,900 --> 00:55:29,630
Like what?
He's doing better.

1258
00:55:30,210 --> 00:55:31,110
He's doing better.

1259
00:55:32,060 --> 00:55:33,680
His was,
I want to say it's better,

1260
00:55:33,980 --> 00:55:38,180
but his show is really about the car,
whereas seinfeld is like,

1261
00:55:38,181 --> 00:55:40,970
the car is just like a set where the 
comic,

1262
00:55:41,030 --> 00:55:44,450
you know ricky gervais' can pretend that
he's laughing hysterically.

1263
00:55:44,930 --> 00:55:46,610
This,
it's a prop,

1264
00:55:46,880 --> 00:55:49,520
You know what I mean?
Whereas with jay leno,

1265
00:55:49,750 --> 00:55:52,910
like I brought my corvette on,
jay leno show a dude,

1266
00:55:52,911 --> 00:55:57,911
that guy fucking loves cars.
I mean he's going over every little inch

1267
00:55:57,921 --> 00:55:59,360
of the car.
we're talking about this,

1268
00:55:59,361 --> 00:56:01,880
we're talking about that.
You see this glint in his eyes.

1269
00:56:01,881 --> 00:56:05,410
He's talking about suspensions and tires
and wheels and you know,

1270
00:56:05,420 --> 00:56:07,840
what kind of power steering you're 
running and will.

1271
00:56:07,960 --> 00:56:08,793
What are you doing for the interior with
the bolsters and the seats of these 

1272
00:56:11,331 --> 00:56:12,170
stock.
These are.

1273
00:56:12,200 --> 00:56:15,230
These are custom where he's coming from.
He does that with every car man.

1274
00:56:15,231 --> 00:56:16,910
He fucking loves cars.

1275
00:56:17,030 --> 00:56:19,430
So for him it's not even about being 
funny.

1276
00:56:19,431 --> 00:56:21,350
He doesn't give a shit of a whole show.
Goes by way.

1277
00:56:21,351 --> 00:56:22,184
It doesn't crack a single joke.
He'll just talk about I now I've seen 

1278
00:56:25,211 --> 00:56:30,211
him host the tonight show,
sort of a bitch.

1279
00:56:31,030 --> 00:56:34,600
You son of a bitch that was more of a 
letter man Guy.

1280
00:56:34,630 --> 00:56:37,510
He's way better doing this than anything
he's ever done.

1281
00:56:37,511 --> 00:56:38,344
That's great.
And he and I had a conversation about 

1282
00:56:39,401 --> 00:56:39,671
it,
you know,

1283
00:56:39,671 --> 00:56:41,440
and he,
he was like really honest about it.

1284
00:56:41,441 --> 00:56:43,660
He talks about it on my podcast too.
He's like,

1285
00:56:43,661 --> 00:56:44,494
you know,
I used to have these people on and I 

1286
00:56:45,821 --> 00:56:47,710
didn't give a fuck about what they were 
doing.

1287
00:56:47,890 --> 00:56:50,220
I didn't know the band,
you know,

1288
00:56:50,230 --> 00:56:50,741
he's like,
fuck,

1289
00:56:50,741 --> 00:56:54,040
I'm 57 years old and I know this band,
this band.

1290
00:56:54,220 --> 00:56:55,060
He's like,
I didn't care,

1291
00:56:55,061 --> 00:56:55,900
but it does the job.

1292
00:56:56,150 --> 00:56:58,390
The job was to be friendly,
have this people out.

1293
00:56:58,391 --> 00:56:59,224
He goes,
now he goes on talking about what I 

1294
00:57:00,611 --> 00:57:02,320
love.
These are these cars.

1295
00:57:02,530 --> 00:57:03,790
He loves cars,
man.

1296
00:57:04,030 --> 00:57:04,863
You bring that guy a car and you know,
it's especially like a hot rod or 

1297
00:57:08,231 --> 00:57:11,830
something like that.
He just gets to spark in his iron man.

1298
00:57:11,831 --> 00:57:15,220
He just walks around them.
He just has a d almost as much as he has

1299
00:57:15,221 --> 00:57:17,980
a love for comedy.
I don't know if they're the same level,

1300
00:57:17,981 --> 00:57:20,650
but it's like right above my love cars 
more.

1301
00:57:20,710 --> 00:57:22,390
He really did.
He might love cars more.

1302
00:57:22,480 --> 00:57:23,800
Do you think he should dye his hair 
black?

1303
00:57:24,550 --> 00:57:26,070
Fuck dude.
He's wearing jeans.

1304
00:57:26,071 --> 00:57:27,720
ShirTs.
he's worth $100,000,000

1305
00:57:27,730 --> 00:57:28,563
for like a hook as fuck.
He's got like 11 cars that are worth 

1306
00:57:32,351 --> 00:57:35,050
more than a million dollars.
Man.

1307
00:57:35,800 --> 00:57:38,920
They're all over the place and it is 
fucking garages.

1308
00:57:38,950 --> 00:57:39,783
It's crazy.
It's got these old lamborghinis and 

1309
00:57:41,381 --> 00:57:42,940
shit.
These old ferrari's.

1310
00:57:43,210 --> 00:57:45,880
You looked at him like what?
He's got a car with a jet engine.

1311
00:57:46,890 --> 00:57:48,400
Wow.
And is it true?

1312
00:57:48,401 --> 00:57:50,370
Like what about the day here is that he 
doesn't,

1313
00:57:50,440 --> 00:57:52,410
doesn't spend his tonight show many 
accolades.

1314
00:57:52,411 --> 00:57:54,580
It's all from standup doing corporate 
gigs.

1315
00:57:54,880 --> 00:57:56,770
Oh my god.
It's all corporate gigs.

1316
00:57:58,790 --> 00:58:02,290
You got to think a guy like that guy on 
the coast,

1317
00:58:02,310 --> 00:58:04,660
the tonight show,
if you do a corporate gig,

1318
00:58:04,661 --> 00:58:08,560
you can make a ton of money.
Like I don't think people understand.

1319
00:58:08,561 --> 00:58:11,170
He's probably making hundreds of 
thousands of dollars a gig.

1320
00:58:11,380 --> 00:58:12,910
They're flying them out there on a 
private jet.

1321
00:58:12,911 --> 00:58:14,980
He does the gig that comes back and does
the tonight show,

1322
00:58:15,370 --> 00:58:16,840
so he would leave the tonight,
show,

1323
00:58:16,841 --> 00:58:18,430
the tonight show tapes during the 
daytime.

1324
00:58:18,610 --> 00:58:21,730
He'd be done.
He'd fly somewhere on his private jet,

1325
00:58:22,030 --> 00:58:22,863
do some ridiculous corporate gig,
make hundreds of thousands of dollars 

1326
00:58:25,271 --> 00:58:26,021
in,
fly right back,

1327
00:58:26,021 --> 00:58:28,240
and then do it again and do it again and
do it again,

1328
00:58:28,360 --> 00:58:30,430
and he's making millions of dollars a 
month doing that.

1329
00:58:30,700 --> 00:58:35,700
Burbank airport balling shade leno's 
man.

1330
00:58:36,830 --> 00:58:37,663
When I had him on my podcast,
he swore he was telling crazy stories 

1331
00:58:40,211 --> 00:58:42,130
about when he worked with the mafia and 
mafia.

1332
00:58:42,131 --> 00:58:43,420
People were threatening guys.
Life.

1333
00:58:43,421 --> 00:58:44,500
These monsters.
Yeah.

1334
00:58:44,550 --> 00:58:45,383
Was hilarious.
Hanging out with the salton and I don't 

1335
00:58:47,081 --> 00:58:47,914
think so.
He never never put the slippers on the 

1336
00:58:49,571 --> 00:58:52,750
golden underwear.
I want to figure out how to make friends

1337
00:58:52,751 --> 00:58:55,660
with this guy.
I want to ride around in a gold car.

1338
00:58:56,940 --> 00:58:57,773
Yeah.
You don't want to be friends with 

1339
00:58:58,681 --> 00:59:02,880
somebody that's that powerful because if
you fuck up or you do something wrong,

1340
00:59:03,210 --> 00:59:05,940
then you have somebody that powerful.
It gets your enemy.

1341
00:59:06,450 --> 00:59:07,380
I,
I,

1342
00:59:07,410 --> 00:59:09,930
there's this guy named ikea or whatever 
his name is.

1343
00:59:09,931 --> 00:59:12,570
Jay owns this,
whatever this thing,

1344
00:59:12,630 --> 00:59:16,980
and I got scared.
You might want to say as the name before

1345
00:59:17,150 --> 00:59:19,730
any other description talked about it on
joe rogan before.

1346
00:59:19,950 --> 00:59:20,783
Remember we used to do a with him.
Remember that really rich guy that had 

1347
00:59:23,571 --> 00:59:25,820
that.
Oh he mentioned it,

1348
00:59:27,470 --> 00:59:31,070
but it was scary because after a while 
you're like,

1349
00:59:31,130 --> 00:59:34,910
you don't want somebody that's wants to,
is going to troll you for life.

1350
00:59:35,330 --> 00:59:38,630
That is that powerful and rich and 
that's what it felt like with this guy.

1351
00:59:38,631 --> 00:59:39,441
Like,
oh,

1352
00:59:39,441 --> 00:59:41,760
if I get on his side where I become like
a,

1353
00:59:41,920 --> 00:59:42,753
a baba booey or some kind of howard 
stern guy and he could just like fuck 

1354
00:59:45,891 --> 00:59:48,920
with me for the rest of my life.
Kind of like what they're doing upstairs

1355
00:59:48,950 --> 00:59:51,560
at the dingdong share right now with 
perry there.

1356
00:59:51,580 --> 00:59:56,580
They're saying that don's dead right now
and they're fucking is dead though.

1357
00:59:56,990 --> 00:59:57,870
Sure.

1358
00:59:59,120 --> 01:00:02,710
What barriers you fuck the whole thing.
He doesn't know internet.

1359
01:00:02,720 --> 01:00:04,310
Seeing the live stream right now.

1360
01:00:04,590 --> 01:00:06,060
Well listen dude,
you wouldn't be that guy.

1361
01:00:06,061 --> 01:00:09,560
You're not that fucked up.
But you know what I mean though,

1362
01:00:09,561 --> 01:00:11,700
I don't necessarily know what you mean,
but I do know what you mean.

1363
01:00:11,701 --> 01:00:13,410
I just don't think you're describing it 
in the best way.

1364
01:00:13,440 --> 01:00:14,273
But yeah,
I don't make an enemy out of a crazy 

1365
01:00:15,841 --> 01:00:17,260
rich dude.
Like powerful.

1366
01:00:17,310 --> 01:00:20,010
Yeah.
They're almost scary to even know.

1367
01:00:20,300 --> 01:00:22,680
Got it.
I wonder what else is sultans do for fun

1368
01:00:22,681 --> 01:00:23,580
though?
You kNow what I mean?

1369
01:00:25,350 --> 01:00:27,520
I'd love to know what that is like.
I get like,

1370
01:00:27,521 --> 01:00:28,354
I mean,
I'm just saying if he fucks on that 

1371
01:00:29,521 --> 01:00:31,890
level of eeny meeny,
miny moe,

1372
01:00:32,250 --> 01:00:37,050
than what else is he doing for fun on 
that level that we can't imagine because

1373
01:00:37,051 --> 01:00:39,660
that's how he fucked.
So how does he eat?

1374
01:00:39,720 --> 01:00:43,310
You know what I mean?
Like imagine what he must walk into.

1375
01:00:43,560 --> 01:00:44,440
Well,
you know,

1376
01:00:44,480 --> 01:00:47,100
if his palace,
if everything really is gold like that,

1377
01:00:47,520 --> 01:00:49,870
his,
his meals must be fucking spective.

1378
01:00:51,120 --> 01:00:52,990
Must be wild.
And

1379
01:00:53,240 --> 01:00:54,230
couple chairs.
I bet.

1380
01:00:54,300 --> 01:00:57,740
I bet he's got boar and elk just stacked
to the ceiling.

1381
01:00:57,950 --> 01:00:58,850
I wonder what they eat.

1382
01:01:00,280 --> 01:01:01,060
Oh yeah.
Who knows?

1383
01:01:01,060 --> 01:01:03,170
Lobsters.
Anything they want,

1384
01:01:03,290 --> 01:01:04,123
you know,
I get it.

1385
01:01:04,170 --> 01:01:08,710
I bet it's one of those things where he 
probably has food shipped damn everyday,

1386
01:01:08,720 --> 01:01:09,553
so he gets to choose what he wants and 
it's always fresh and they just get rid 

1387
01:01:12,561 --> 01:01:13,400
of what he does.
Neat.

1388
01:01:13,760 --> 01:01:14,593
I bet it'S one of those deals because I 
bet when when you have that kind of 

1389
01:01:17,240 --> 01:01:18,073
money,
you would probably want to have like a 

1390
01:01:20,211 --> 01:01:23,000
full menu where you could pick from 
whatever you want.

1391
01:01:23,001 --> 01:01:23,834
Even if it was just You eating alone.
He's probably one of those guys so they 

1392
01:01:26,901 --> 01:01:29,430
have to fly in fish and lobster and

1393
01:01:29,830 --> 01:01:33,090
it's probably a vegan.
It's probably like vegan.

1394
01:01:33,130 --> 01:01:34,630
I don't know.
He just seems like you'd be vegan.

1395
01:01:35,300 --> 01:01:39,800
Why would you think that a guy who fucks
all those girls and lives in a gold pals

1396
01:01:39,830 --> 01:01:41,410
vegan?
Because you think you'd be like,

1397
01:01:41,460 --> 01:01:43,840
oh,
the library because he can afford it.

1398
01:01:43,841 --> 01:01:45,610
Most people can't afford healthy 
lifestyle.

1399
01:01:46,190 --> 01:01:48,570
Healthy lifestyle.
Yeah.

1400
01:01:49,460 --> 01:01:50,293
It's expensive to be vegan.
They keep this guy pretty low key 

1401
01:01:52,541 --> 01:01:53,374
though.
Huh?

1402
01:01:54,320 --> 01:01:55,850
Um,
well he keeps himself low keY,

1403
01:01:55,851 --> 01:01:56,684
particularly now after that whole thing 
with that girl writing that article or 

1404
01:02:00,591 --> 01:02:03,550
the book or whatever the fuck she was 
trying to write after tom,

1405
01:02:03,580 --> 01:02:03,840
don,

1406
01:02:03,840 --> 01:02:04,673
they have a three day,
I don't know if you were to call it a 

1407
01:02:06,881 --> 01:02:08,650
festival or something,
but they allow,

1408
01:02:08,651 --> 01:02:09,484
it says 30,000
locals and visitors arrive each day to 

1409
01:02:11,801 --> 01:02:14,920
banquet at the royal family's palace.
Wow.

1410
01:02:15,770 --> 01:02:19,000
Fees for the locals I suppose after 
ramadan.

1411
01:02:19,740 --> 01:02:20,040
So

1412
01:02:20,040 --> 01:02:22,890
he's muslim.
So he probably eats things that are.

1413
01:02:22,891 --> 01:02:24,100
Hello.
So he,

1414
01:02:24,140 --> 01:02:27,270
he probably eats a lot of meeting 
whenever the fuck he wants.

1415
01:02:28,650 --> 01:02:29,483
They have restrictions.
So I don't think he's allowed to eat 

1416
01:02:31,201 --> 01:02:33,510
pork.
So he's probably not eating bore.

1417
01:02:34,070 --> 01:02:35,640
See they,
they came up with all that stuff though.

1418
01:02:35,641 --> 01:02:37,320
Back when people are getting diseases,
man,

1419
01:02:37,670 --> 01:02:38,341
you know,
pigs,

1420
01:02:38,341 --> 01:02:39,570
they eat whatever the fuck they want,
lead,

1421
01:02:39,571 --> 01:02:43,650
eat everything including each other.
So they probably came up with that stuff

1422
01:02:43,680 --> 01:02:46,440
like those religious rules about pork in
particular.

1423
01:02:46,560 --> 01:02:49,410
That's almost definitely related to 
disease and illness.

1424
01:02:49,970 --> 01:02:51,690
You know,
it doesn't make sense.

1425
01:02:51,900 --> 01:02:52,733
Jews and muslims all have that in their,
in their religion that you're not 

1426
01:02:56,971 --> 01:02:57,990
supposed to be eating pork.

1427
01:02:58,440 --> 01:02:59,273
What do you think about this?
Like trump taking the ta or the us 

1428
01:03:02,281 --> 01:03:04,620
government to Israel?
Have you heard about that?

1429
01:03:04,950 --> 01:03:06,720
But uh,
um,

1430
01:03:07,140 --> 01:03:08,130
you know,
when other con,

1431
01:03:08,190 --> 01:03:10,380
when you have like bases in other 
countries,

1432
01:03:10,400 --> 01:03:12,120
he's going to put a base in Israel.
So I would just say.

1433
01:03:12,180 --> 01:03:13,013
And that's something that presidents 
have been scared to do for a long time 

1434
01:03:15,631 --> 01:03:18,960
and he's at palestine's like pissed.
Is that true?

1435
01:03:18,961 --> 01:03:23,961
Jamie just said at the end of the,
at the end of the feast,

1436
01:03:24,580 --> 01:03:25,413
everyone gets a cake,
but he also inserted a clause into the 

1437
01:03:28,051 --> 01:03:28,884
constitution that proclaims quote,
he can do no wrong and either as 

1438
01:03:31,800 --> 01:03:34,110
personal or any official capacity

1439
01:03:35,090 --> 01:03:38,540
that's in this constitution gave them a 
cake man.

1440
01:03:38,541 --> 01:03:41,540
What the fuck do you want?
He can do no wrong.

1441
01:03:42,710 --> 01:03:46,010
So you can do whatever he wants.
So he has a clause in their constitution

1442
01:03:46,011 --> 01:03:47,410
that he could do whatever he wants.
What does it say?

1443
01:03:47,430 --> 01:03:48,263
Coming to our constitution,
trump's plan to move the us embassy to 

1444
01:03:51,400 --> 01:03:52,280
jerusalem?

1445
01:03:52,660 --> 01:03:56,430
Truthfully,
I can't even talk to you.

1446
01:03:56,930 --> 01:04:00,890
Ruzzio.
Welcome to read.

1447
01:04:01,620 --> 01:04:02,750
Are you drunk?
Got drunk.

1448
01:04:02,790 --> 01:04:07,260
You brian now struggling with the words 
jersey tourism?

1449
01:04:07,820 --> 01:04:08,890
Yeah,
I mean that's just,

1450
01:04:08,891 --> 01:04:10,560
it's a weird word though.
Jerusalem.

1451
01:04:11,190 --> 01:04:12,490
Jerusalem.
The um.

1452
01:04:13,560 --> 01:04:16,350
I can't even say it.
They used to have some crazy ass words.

1453
01:04:16,440 --> 01:04:18,310
Mesopotamia.
Yeah.

1454
01:04:18,900 --> 01:04:19,733
Jerusalem is a jerusalem.
That's where I stop and think about 

1455
01:04:23,131 --> 01:04:23,460
that.
Like,

1456
01:04:23,460 --> 01:04:27,650
how about czechoslovakia?
Why do you have to use so many noises in

1457
01:04:27,790 --> 01:04:29,850
Poland?
Polish areas.

1458
01:04:29,870 --> 01:04:31,020
But why?
Why?

1459
01:04:31,870 --> 01:04:35,120
Um,
welcome to the wealth and the wet.

1460
01:04:35,130 --> 01:04:35,401
Whoa.
Whoa,

1461
01:04:35,401 --> 01:04:36,234
whoa.
Slow down.

1462
01:04:36,360 --> 01:04:38,880
Why did you name your,
your place that this is your spot.

1463
01:04:39,210 --> 01:04:40,730
The noise I make for my spot.

1464
01:04:40,830 --> 01:04:41,663
I mean think of what they think.
We don't know what lithium Lithuania 

1465
01:04:44,090 --> 01:04:44,923
means,
but thing of what they hear when we go 

1466
01:04:46,790 --> 01:04:49,450
the,
the United States of America though,

1467
01:04:50,040 --> 01:04:51,320
like they're probably like listening.

1468
01:04:52,490 --> 01:04:54,190
Well they need to talk to me and I'll 
just go.

1469
01:04:54,610 --> 01:04:59,610
Marika marika way from America,
from czechoslovakia and your name sounds

1470
01:05:02,501 --> 01:05:05,110
funny.
How come your name so long?

1471
01:05:05,140 --> 01:05:08,020
How come y'all decided to put all those 
fucking sounds in your name?

1472
01:05:08,410 --> 01:05:09,243
Greedy ass sound user sucking up,
all of a sudden attributed it to your 

1473
01:05:13,511 --> 01:05:14,470
patch of dirt.
Huh?

1474
01:05:14,590 --> 01:05:16,420
How big is this?
Czechoslovakia?

1475
01:05:17,020 --> 01:05:19,780
That's it.
That little tiny ass thing with that big

1476
01:05:19,781 --> 01:05:23,350
old fucking name as the problem and a 
lot of them are real little.

1477
01:05:23,440 --> 01:05:25,240
How big struggles avaya.
Is that a big spot?

1478
01:05:25,270 --> 01:05:26,103
Maybe that's what it means.
Maybe they're trying to overcompensate 

1479
01:05:27,611 --> 01:05:29,080
for hockey.
A big spot.

1480
01:05:29,810 --> 01:05:31,570
Am I talking shit now?
It's little.

1481
01:05:31,930 --> 01:05:34,910
It seems like it would be little.
Yeah.

1482
01:05:35,110 --> 01:05:37,480
Gimme a the dumbest name of a country 
that you know.

1483
01:05:37,481 --> 01:05:39,010
Algeria.
Why?

1484
01:05:39,520 --> 01:05:40,353
Because it's just.
They didn't know that name before they 

1485
01:05:42,281 --> 01:05:47,281
came up with that name didn't exist 
because is stan.

1486
01:05:48,340 --> 01:05:49,173
Oh,
right.

1487
01:05:50,440 --> 01:05:52,930
Antartica.
that's kind of a goofy one.

1488
01:05:52,931 --> 01:05:55,210
But it sounds pretty because it's not a 
lot of z's in it,

1489
01:05:56,320 --> 01:05:58,240
you know,
throwing a lot of zs.

1490
01:05:59,410 --> 01:06:04,410
You know it's supposed to be from 
kazakHstan.

1491
01:06:04,570 --> 01:06:05,740
They get super mad at him,
you know,

1492
01:06:05,741 --> 01:06:07,830
they sued them.
That whole fucking good.

1493
01:06:07,831 --> 01:06:08,664
They are so pissed.
I bet that guy has to hide those 

1494
01:06:11,411 --> 01:06:16,411
Kazakhstan people are so fucking pissed 
because the character he's time.

1495
01:06:21,790 --> 01:06:22,623
Could you imagine if there's was one guy
who was doing this character of your 

1496
01:06:27,011 --> 01:06:27,844
tiny little country and it is a fucking 
huge smash comedy hit this complete 

1497
01:06:33,671 --> 01:06:38,671
recharge is representing your country 
and just fucking up everything.

1498
01:06:39,060 --> 01:06:39,893
You know.
Remember when he did that movie and I 

1499
01:06:41,620 --> 01:06:44,890
asked him where to go to the bathroom 
and he took a shit in a bag.

1500
01:06:44,891 --> 01:06:46,810
They handed the lady the bag trying to 
get.

1501
01:06:47,110 --> 01:06:48,550
I go there,
I do it this.

1502
01:06:48,730 --> 01:06:49,421
and she's like,
well,

1503
01:06:49,421 --> 01:06:51,190
what's that?
This is my shit.

1504
01:06:51,340 --> 01:06:52,173
Boy.
Do you see as new one that I heard it 

1505
01:06:56,590 --> 01:06:59,710
was a scene in it that's really worth 
the whole movie.

1506
01:06:59,740 --> 01:07:01,540
Which one is his new one?
Uh,

1507
01:07:01,541 --> 01:07:03,760
the one where he's like a tennis player 
or something like that.

1508
01:07:03,780 --> 01:07:06,700
Like a problem with those is those are 
comedies.

1509
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:11,230
They're not like little what I like and 
the stuff that's illegal now,

1510
01:07:11,480 --> 01:07:12,313
right?
Yeah.

1511
01:07:12,490 --> 01:07:15,040
so the stuff that he used to do it,
he kept getting sued for.

1512
01:07:15,250 --> 01:07:19,420
That's the best shit jackass was on the 
other night on the front porch after the

1513
01:07:19,421 --> 01:07:22,940
roast battle and just watching jackass.
I missed that.

1514
01:07:22,941 --> 01:07:26,800
That there's something to that.
So funny that just seeing people getting

1515
01:07:26,801 --> 01:07:28,560
fucked up,
it's one of the

1516
01:07:28,640 --> 01:07:30,880
funniest thing.
So it's just undeniaBly funny.

1517
01:07:30,940 --> 01:07:31,810
It's unbelievable.

1518
01:07:31,810 --> 01:07:32,270
Well,
yeah,

1519
01:07:32,270 --> 01:07:34,510
it's instinctual.
It's like in your,

1520
01:07:34,511 --> 01:07:36,270
in your system.
Like there's,

1521
01:07:36,280 --> 01:07:38,540
I remember I'll never forget this one 
where they,

1522
01:07:38,800 --> 01:07:39,880
they,
they uh,

1523
01:07:39,970 --> 01:07:40,803
had this big hand on a spring that would
give guys high fives and it would come 

1524
01:07:45,701 --> 01:07:46,534
out of nowhere just fucking nail you and
send you fly it across the room and had 

1525
01:07:49,181 --> 01:07:50,014
bags of flour on it.
So like when it hit the flat face and 

1526
01:07:54,461 --> 01:07:56,830
blow you up with flour and it was 
fucking huge.

1527
01:07:56,831 --> 01:07:58,360
Like it would knock people over.
Yeah.

1528
01:07:58,480 --> 01:08:02,290
They're all amazing.
I love jack ass so fucking much.

1529
01:08:02,410 --> 01:08:06,340
And I stumbled across jackass two point 
five recently,

1530
01:08:06,700 --> 01:08:07,533
which is basically all the footage that 
they didn't get a chance to use or that 

1531
01:08:11,951 --> 01:08:12,784
was too edgy or came out to extreme for 
their show wild boys because it turns 

1532
01:08:17,421 --> 01:08:20,450
out that they had to like have it ready 
for mtv.

1533
01:08:20,451 --> 01:08:24,230
It was just different than that shit.
They were really pulling at this level.

1534
01:08:24,560 --> 01:08:26,870
So anything in which the network heads 
were like,

1535
01:08:26,871 --> 01:08:30,140
we can't air that on mtv two or whatever
the fuck wild boys was on.

1536
01:08:31,600 --> 01:08:32,433
They just turned it into this super 
movie of shit that was literally too 

1537
01:08:35,991 --> 01:08:40,100
fucking good for mtv and the show wild 
boys at the time.

1538
01:08:40,120 --> 01:08:43,180
So what's it called and why?
It's a jackass.

1539
01:08:43,190 --> 01:08:44,023
Two point five.
And so these guys and remember the dorm 

1540
01:08:45,711 --> 01:08:47,210
wild boys,
which is more like,

1541
01:08:47,211 --> 01:08:48,044
you know,
like they're out in the safaris and the 

1542
01:08:49,521 --> 01:08:50,190
desert.

1543
01:08:50,190 --> 01:08:54,160
It's like with cheetah and everything.
Yeah,

1544
01:08:54,180 --> 01:08:55,820
they were playing.
Keep away with hyenas,

1545
01:08:55,821 --> 01:08:58,640
with a ham and some of them fucking 
scary.

1546
01:08:58,641 --> 01:09:02,030
That is no,
I mean I hyenas will cure you.

1547
01:09:02,090 --> 01:09:07,090
There's huge 200 pound wild dogs that 
crush bones with their teeth and they're

1548
01:09:08,271 --> 01:09:09,104
playing.
Keep away with them wild I anus with a 

1549
01:09:10,461 --> 01:09:11,294
ham.
They're standing right in front of them 

1550
01:09:13,010 --> 01:09:14,960
with no fence,
no protection.

1551
01:09:15,380 --> 01:09:16,213
Those guys are fucking hilarious.
The other thIng about jack as two point 

1552
01:09:19,911 --> 01:09:20,744
five is they're the ones that were also 
like you could tell a couple of them 

1553
01:09:22,761 --> 01:09:26,750
were just so disgusting that they could 
input it on mtv.

1554
01:09:26,810 --> 01:09:31,670
Like my favorite fucking one and it just
like I was dying of laughter.

1555
01:09:31,671 --> 01:09:33,290
I've been,
I have is howling like,

1556
01:09:33,350 --> 01:09:35,690
like an animal all of a sudden,
you know,

1557
01:09:35,691 --> 01:09:37,100
and there's sort of like explaining 
like,

1558
01:09:37,101 --> 01:09:38,060
you know,
we didn't know what we,

1559
01:09:38,140 --> 01:09:40,820
we met this one guy who was the world's 
longest fingernails.

1560
01:09:40,820 --> 01:09:42,110
We dIdn't know what we were going to do 
with them.

1561
01:09:42,111 --> 01:09:45,320
And another cool thing about two point 
five is it's sorta like more documentary

1562
01:09:45,321 --> 01:09:48,950
style because they're like laughing 
about all this footage from India.

1563
01:09:49,190 --> 01:09:53,020
He has these crazy crew,
super duper long fingernails and they're

1564
01:09:53,040 --> 01:09:54,650
like,
we didn't end up knowing what to do with

1565
01:09:54,651 --> 01:09:56,480
this guy.
So you know,

1566
01:09:56,510 --> 01:09:57,343
steve,
I had this one idea and then that was 

1567
01:09:58,551 --> 01:09:59,384
it.
And all of a sudden it cuts to this 

1568
01:10:01,670 --> 01:10:02,570
indian guy,
you know,

1569
01:10:02,571 --> 01:10:03,540
you've seen them.
Like they,

1570
01:10:03,560 --> 01:10:04,393
they just giant long fingernails,
like five feet long or whatever the 

1571
01:10:06,681 --> 01:10:07,514
fuck.
And all of a sudden you just see an 

1572
01:10:08,840 --> 01:10:12,110
indian guy's face and it slowly starts 
to pan out.

1573
01:10:12,111 --> 01:10:12,944
You see as naIls.
And he has a bottle of miller lite and 

1574
01:10:16,041 --> 01:10:17,960
he just goes,
hello,

1575
01:10:17,990 --> 01:10:20,510
I am blah blah blah blah.
This is miller time.

1576
01:10:20,660 --> 01:10:24,160
And you see them just start to pour the 
beer on the back of his hand that's just

1577
01:10:24,740 --> 01:10:25,573
hanging there and back of his hand that 
has the fingernails and all the beer 

1578
01:10:28,671 --> 01:10:30,850
starts rolling down his fingernails and 
the,

1579
01:10:30,900 --> 01:10:33,200
as the camera pans out,
you just start to hear like,

1580
01:10:35,450 --> 01:10:37,670
you just start to hear that noise.
And as it pans out,

1581
01:10:37,671 --> 01:10:38,504
you see steve was laying on his back,
on the ground underneath them and all 

1582
01:10:42,411 --> 01:10:43,610
that.
Miller beer.

1583
01:10:43,611 --> 01:10:46,850
He's rolling down the fingernails.
Water slide.

1584
01:10:46,970 --> 01:10:47,803
I was screaming.
I was screaming by myself in my 

1585
01:10:52,971 --> 01:10:57,490
apartment watching this dying of 
laughter.

1586
01:10:57,560 --> 01:11:00,980
There it is.
Jamie's got it this time.

1587
01:11:00,981 --> 01:11:02,540
But you.
But you hear steve.

1588
01:11:02,541 --> 01:11:04,070
Okay.
Gagging before the camera.

1589
01:11:04,100 --> 01:11:07,310
You've been so fucking funny.

1590
01:11:15,370 --> 01:11:20,370
He's gagging and throwing up so much he 
throws up.

1591
01:11:21,270 --> 01:11:22,320
Oh,
it's about to get great.

1592
01:11:22,410 --> 01:11:27,410
Right?
These indian.

1593
01:11:29,090 --> 01:11:32,430
So oh my god.
Oh my god.

1594
01:11:32,970 --> 01:11:34,740
look at the pile of vomit in front of 
them.

1595
01:11:34,741 --> 01:11:35,574
It's cute.

1596
01:11:36,260 --> 01:11:38,390
That's the worst.
Steevo is crazy.

1597
01:11:38,840 --> 01:11:40,760
So interesting.
Seeing him sober now.

1598
01:11:41,510 --> 01:11:43,910
He's a fun guy.
I really liked that guy a lot.

1599
01:11:44,090 --> 01:11:44,923
He knew who was not sober.
Andy dick the other day told you in 

1600
01:11:48,220 --> 01:11:51,380
hell.
It was the most uncomfortable thing.

1601
01:11:52,040 --> 01:11:54,660
They let andy and if he was drinking and
I don't know.

1602
01:11:54,940 --> 01:11:56,560
You know what man?
I knew that was gonna happen,

1603
01:11:56,570 --> 01:11:59,590
but he stole david's beer.
He heckled them the times.

1604
01:11:59,960 --> 01:12:04,490
Still three beers stole my last call,
last call and I got to tread noise given

1605
01:12:04,500 --> 01:12:05,720
impact and aggressive.

1606
01:12:05,810 --> 01:12:07,700
Listen man.
That's Why I didn't have mine again.

1607
01:12:07,810 --> 01:12:09,950
I just telling you like,
this is not gonna.

1608
01:12:10,160 --> 01:12:11,800
It's not gonna last.
It's not temp.

1609
01:12:11,840 --> 01:12:14,120
It's just temporary.
The sobriety thing.

1610
01:12:14,121 --> 01:12:14,954
Working on sobriety.
He's a slingshot and he pulled that 

1611
01:12:17,931 --> 01:12:21,620
slingshot back and then he's eventually 
got to let it go and I don't know why.

1612
01:12:21,621 --> 01:12:23,720
I don't know.
I don't understand sobriety.

1613
01:12:23,721 --> 01:12:24,554
I don't understand people that go off 
the rails like he does where they get 

1614
01:12:27,981 --> 01:12:30,170
that fucked up and that crazy,
but he's got it.

1615
01:12:30,171 --> 01:12:30,850
Whatever that is.

1616
01:12:30,850 --> 01:12:33,000
You worked with them all the way back.
Fuck him.

1617
01:12:33,001 --> 01:12:35,800
And I worked with him for five years and
was always that way.

1618
01:12:35,830 --> 01:12:37,160
Always that way.
Party machine.

1619
01:12:37,161 --> 01:12:37,380
okay.

1620
01:12:37,380 --> 01:12:39,630
A lot of it is,
I really honestly believe this.

1621
01:12:39,631 --> 01:12:41,190
And maybe andy would probably agree with
me.

1622
01:12:41,191 --> 01:12:43,980
I think some shit happened to him when 
he was a child,

1623
01:12:44,330 --> 01:12:45,630
you know,
and I think um,

1624
01:12:45,690 --> 01:12:47,280
he,
he battles that,

1625
01:12:47,760 --> 01:12:48,593
you know,
and I think he has like a real issue 

1626
01:12:49,981 --> 01:12:50,550
man.
And he,

1627
01:12:50,550 --> 01:12:51,990
he,
he's talked about it before.

1628
01:12:52,230 --> 01:12:54,150
I'm not revealing anything that he 
hasn't said already,

1629
01:12:54,151 --> 01:12:57,480
but he doesn't remember like a lot of 
his childhood or a lot of it.

1630
01:12:57,510 --> 01:13:01,140
It's blocked it out and he's got a 
substance problem he just had,

1631
01:13:01,170 --> 01:13:05,580
he has it more than anybody I've ever 
met in terms of like he gets it and then

1632
01:13:05,581 --> 01:13:06,414
that switch goes off and he's gone.
He's off to the races and he's a sweet 

1633
01:13:09,481 --> 01:13:12,960
guy and he's a fucking talented guy.
He's a really funny guy.

1634
01:13:12,961 --> 01:13:15,360
Like andy and I,
we did scenes together.

1635
01:13:15,560 --> 01:13:16,393
Well we had to do three,
four and five takes because I couldn't 

1636
01:13:18,091 --> 01:13:20,700
stop laughing.
I was holding it in as much as I can.

1637
01:13:21,060 --> 01:13:22,440
He's a really funny guy.

1638
01:13:22,650 --> 01:13:26,400
It's shit faced to end as a negative and
annoying as he was the other night.

1639
01:13:26,401 --> 01:13:31,360
He was still sort of killing it through 
this glaze of just annoyance.

1640
01:13:31,400 --> 01:13:32,360
I mean,
of course,

1641
01:13:32,820 --> 01:13:33,653
of course.
It was like he was just the scottie 

1642
01:13:34,591 --> 01:13:35,424
pippin is chappelle's Jordan because he 
was literally heckling chappelle while 

1643
01:13:38,101 --> 01:13:39,460
he's on status.
That's fucked up,

1644
01:13:40,300 --> 01:13:41,500
david again,
you know,

1645
01:13:41,510 --> 01:13:42,600
they should have kicked him out.
Yeah,

1646
01:13:42,601 --> 01:13:44,760
they totally shut of you can't do that.
Yeah,

1647
01:13:44,940 --> 01:13:47,170
you can't do that.
And then he tried to fuck our friend.

1648
01:13:50,320 --> 01:13:51,153
The first five times I met andy,
he was completely shit faced and 

1649
01:13:54,301 --> 01:13:56,880
obsessed with trying to fuck me and that
was,

1650
01:13:56,890 --> 01:13:57,511
I'm like,
okay,

1651
01:13:57,511 --> 01:13:58,610
nice to meet you again.
And,

1652
01:13:58,710 --> 01:14:02,310
and that was that.
And then the last few times he was sober

1653
01:14:02,400 --> 01:14:05,340
and fucking awesome.
Really great guy.

1654
01:14:05,700 --> 01:14:08,730
And then I saw them for the first time 
since that the other night.

1655
01:14:08,790 --> 01:14:12,010
And he's sitting in a chair right in 
back bar area,

1656
01:14:12,040 --> 01:14:12,873
like where the employees are.
He's the only one just sitting there in 

1657
01:14:14,321 --> 01:14:15,940
a chair and I'm like,
oh,

1658
01:14:15,941 --> 01:14:16,774
I wonder what happened to annie as I'm 
walking up all in one motion is I get 

1659
01:14:20,021 --> 01:14:23,200
closer.
I see that at the same time he's licking

1660
01:14:23,380 --> 01:14:24,213
somebodies arm that he's with just 
licking their arm up and down and I'm 

1661
01:14:26,891 --> 01:14:28,480
like,
oh no,

1662
01:14:28,481 --> 01:14:29,314
he's not sober anymore.
Like his variation of sobriety and not 

1663
01:14:33,911 --> 01:14:34,744
sober.
I've never seen him like getting drunk 

1664
01:14:36,371 --> 01:14:38,920
or having a drink.
I've only seen him on her.

1665
01:14:38,921 --> 01:14:41,680
Absolutely.
At a thousand miles an hour.

1666
01:14:41,681 --> 01:14:46,681
Shit faced and aggressively sexual 
continuously or very nice dude.

1667
01:14:47,650 --> 01:14:48,790
Yeah,
it's so weird.

1668
01:14:48,820 --> 01:14:49,690
I think he's a nice dude.

1669
01:14:49,950 --> 01:14:52,200
These are nice too.
I think he really is a good guy.

1670
01:14:52,230 --> 01:14:53,063
I think andy's a very good guy.
He's just a very good guy that does not 

1671
01:14:55,111 --> 01:14:58,200
get along with substances and he needs 
them for whatever reason.

1672
01:14:58,220 --> 01:14:58,591
He,
they,

1673
01:14:58,591 --> 01:15:00,570
he was drawn to them,
you know,

1674
01:15:00,571 --> 01:15:03,150
and I don't,
I don't know what you do to cure someone

1675
01:15:03,180 --> 01:15:04,620
of that.
I don't.

1676
01:15:04,621 --> 01:15:05,730
And I think,
you know,

1677
01:15:05,731 --> 01:15:08,520
I wouldn't even if I knew what to cure 
one person,

1678
01:15:08,521 --> 01:15:09,354
I don't think I,
I think everybody has their own 

1679
01:15:10,561 --> 01:15:11,394
individual answer for that.
And I think for some people they just 

1680
01:15:15,421 --> 01:15:20,421
don't want to ever get completely free 
or they do and then they don't,

1681
01:15:20,780 --> 01:15:21,613
you know,
they get bored or they can't take it 

1682
01:15:22,861 --> 01:15:24,480
anymore or whatever the fuck it is.
But,

1683
01:15:24,550 --> 01:15:27,580
but isn't it weird that when somebody 
does start drinking,

1684
01:15:27,730 --> 01:15:30,700
like it's never just like a little bit.
It's never like,

1685
01:15:30,701 --> 01:15:31,540
oh,
you know,

1686
01:15:31,541 --> 01:15:33,280
I started drinking.
I shouldn't be drinking.

1687
01:15:33,281 --> 01:15:35,920
I have a little.
But it's just like opposite.

1688
01:15:36,490 --> 01:15:37,570
Yeah.
It's um,

1689
01:15:38,300 --> 01:15:39,680
it's a genetic thing too,
man.

1690
01:15:40,160 --> 01:15:40,993
There's something about that alcohol.
They either got that thing or you don't 

1691
01:15:43,990 --> 01:15:45,560
know.
Like if they,

1692
01:15:45,680 --> 01:15:46,513
like I'm sitting here,
I've only had waters nine and I'm 

1693
01:15:48,651 --> 01:15:50,080
looking at your,
your drinking.

1694
01:15:50,570 --> 01:15:51,403
You know,
I've had drinks but I'm not like going 

1695
01:15:53,420 --> 01:15:54,253
to fucking drink and drink.
But some people they look at that 

1696
01:15:56,421 --> 01:15:58,630
goddamn drink and they just,
they just feel it.

1697
01:15:58,640 --> 01:15:59,500
You smell,
you smell it.

1698
01:16:01,160 --> 01:16:02,750
Smell that whiskey in there.
And you just go,

1699
01:16:02,751 --> 01:16:04,850
fuck,
fuck.

1700
01:16:04,930 --> 01:16:07,310
He just starts pulling at you and then 
you want it and then you just say,

1701
01:16:07,311 --> 01:16:07,941
fuck it.
Let's just.

1702
01:16:07,941 --> 01:16:09,290
One shot,
just one shot,

1703
01:16:09,291 --> 01:16:10,640
boom.
And they throw it down.

1704
01:16:10,670 --> 01:16:11,503
Yeah.

1705
01:16:11,760 --> 01:16:12,593
Wow.

1706
01:16:12,760 --> 01:16:15,100
Off to the races.
Tate says that's him.

1707
01:16:15,640 --> 01:16:16,151
Yeah,
that's,

1708
01:16:16,151 --> 01:16:16,984
I mean,
you could tell anyone that stopped 

1709
01:16:18,041 --> 01:16:22,120
drinking.
I started drinking red bull or starbucks

1710
01:16:22,121 --> 01:16:23,460
all day.
I'm like,

1711
01:16:23,620 --> 01:16:27,100
the strongest coffee I just had in uh,
in san francisco.

1712
01:16:27,101 --> 01:16:29,890
I had a starbucks.
Has this new nitro,

1713
01:16:30,150 --> 01:16:34,090
a coffee.
It's like having them pull up,

1714
01:16:34,130 --> 01:16:35,410
pour you a pint.
It is.

1715
01:16:35,820 --> 01:16:36,653
It's amazing to.
Companies are making that announce 

1716
01:16:37,940 --> 01:16:39,880
nitrogenated coffee.
It's amazing.

1717
01:16:39,970 --> 01:16:42,910
And they had half of a grand day and I 
was like,

1718
01:16:42,911 --> 01:16:44,230
oh my god,
I feel like I'm on drugs.

1719
01:16:44,260 --> 01:16:47,050
Like we have those cave man once.
Caveman coffee,

1720
01:16:47,051 --> 01:16:47,884
they're small.
They're tiny and they have 270 

1721
01:16:50,621 --> 01:16:52,920
milligrams caffeine.
Is that?

1722
01:16:53,300 --> 01:16:56,410
Yeah.
SO a lot way more than a venti starbucks

1723
01:16:57,370 --> 01:16:58,203
drinks five,
six of those at a time because he 

1724
01:17:00,881 --> 01:17:04,440
doesn't drink fucking 200 years.

1725
01:17:04,540 --> 01:17:05,680
Fifty pounds,
you know?

1726
01:17:05,681 --> 01:17:09,070
So it's Got more room to distribute over
his body.

1727
01:17:09,200 --> 01:17:10,033
Yeah.
He geTs fucking wired on those goddamn 

1728
01:17:11,511 --> 01:17:13,610
things.
Get super excited about.

1729
01:17:13,611 --> 01:17:14,444
I love caffeine.
So much of all the things you can be 

1730
01:17:17,481 --> 01:17:20,570
addicted to that one is the most 
productive and the least destructive.

1731
01:17:20,600 --> 01:17:21,433
It doesn't,
doesn't,

1732
01:17:21,580 --> 01:17:22,413
doesn't fuck you up to the point where 
you make shit decisions or get in car 

1733
01:17:25,191 --> 01:17:25,980
accidents or anything.

1734
01:17:25,980 --> 01:17:29,130
I think I've done so much caffeine.
I don't feeL like I feel it.

1735
01:17:29,190 --> 01:17:31,710
Like I like I'll have coffee,
don't as much.

1736
01:17:32,980 --> 01:17:34,620
It seems something youtube with 
caffeine.

1737
01:17:34,870 --> 01:17:38,620
Well that's why people who use it for 
performance enhancing purposes,

1738
01:17:38,890 --> 01:17:39,723
they like to not use caffeine during the
day normally and then take caffeine 

1739
01:17:43,391 --> 01:17:45,820
before they work out.
Like say if they have wrestling match or

1740
01:17:45,821 --> 01:17:47,290
something like that.
A lot of guyS will do that.

1741
01:17:47,560 --> 01:17:48,393
They'll have no caffeine in their diet 
and then right before they go and fight 

1742
01:17:51,461 --> 01:17:52,294
or something like that,
they'll take a caffeine pill and then 

1743
01:17:55,061 --> 01:17:58,140
they get the full effects of it because 
of the fact that you're not like.

1744
01:17:58,350 --> 01:18:02,620
Like how often we smoked pot,
if we got anybody that doesn't smoke pot

1745
01:18:02,621 --> 01:18:05,380
down here with us and we were hitting 
the same way that we're hitting,

1746
01:18:05,800 --> 01:18:07,480
they would freak out.
We've seen it.

1747
01:18:07,481 --> 01:18:09,910
You've seen it all.
We've seen it before.

1748
01:18:09,911 --> 01:18:11,660
I mean how many times we've gotten 
somebody high like,

1749
01:18:11,710 --> 01:18:13,180
do you get high?
And they'll like,

1750
01:18:13,181 --> 01:18:14,930
well I'll try it.
What the hell?

1751
01:18:14,931 --> 01:18:15,670
Like,
okay.

1752
01:18:15,670 --> 01:18:19,010
They take a big hit and they take a 
second hit and like your god

1753
01:18:19,960 --> 01:18:20,793
for buddy.
I thought he was dying for a second 

1754
01:18:23,230 --> 01:18:25,480
after smoking kelly weed for the first 
time.

1755
01:18:25,570 --> 01:18:28,530
He started shaking and like he literally
sort of like just,

1756
01:18:28,930 --> 01:18:30,580
he looked like he was getting 
electrocuted for.

1757
01:18:30,860 --> 01:18:33,590
We've done that to people so many times.
You know,

1758
01:18:33,591 --> 01:18:37,550
like you want end come on in,
but it's just way too strong for that.

1759
01:18:37,610 --> 01:18:39,500
For us it's nothing.
We do it all the time.

1760
01:18:39,501 --> 01:18:42,230
So it's normal and your body builds up 
this tolerance,

1761
01:18:42,231 --> 01:18:44,720
but if you don't have that tolerance,
you get hit with it.

1762
01:18:44,870 --> 01:18:45,703
And that's what I'm.
Terence mckenna used to say that's the 

1763
01:18:47,121 --> 01:18:47,954
best way to smoke weed.
He just say the best way to do it is to 

1764
01:18:50,241 --> 01:18:54,440
don't do it at all for a long time and 
then do as much as you can stand.

1765
01:18:55,780 --> 01:18:57,950
Yeah.
Like then it becomes,

1766
01:18:57,980 --> 01:19:01,610
well very,
very psychedelic and he would hit.

1767
01:19:01,640 --> 01:19:04,910
his thought was that we abused marijuana
and he was guilty of it himself.

1768
01:19:04,911 --> 01:19:06,470
He said it's one of the things we were 
talking about.

1769
01:19:06,471 --> 01:19:07,330
He's like,
listen,

1770
01:19:07,410 --> 01:19:11,330
before you listen to this,
like I am a confessed cannabis addict.

1771
01:19:11,331 --> 01:19:12,680
He goes,
I small cannabis every day,

1772
01:19:12,710 --> 01:19:13,970
all day.
I smoke it at night,

1773
01:19:14,270 --> 01:19:15,103
but honestly I think the way to do it is
to take a long time off and then smoke 

1774
01:19:20,361 --> 01:19:24,470
your fucking brains out.
Just take like weeks off.

1775
01:19:24,620 --> 01:19:25,530
Just get,
bring you,

1776
01:19:26,080 --> 01:19:28,640
bring your body completely back to 
baseline.

1777
01:19:28,880 --> 01:19:32,860
And then just two days

1778
01:19:32,990 --> 01:19:35,880
often it feels like if I smoke it,
it's back to baseline.

1779
01:19:35,910 --> 01:19:38,280
Like that fast.
I don't want two days off.

1780
01:19:38,340 --> 01:19:39,930
How often you guys go on stage without 
it?

1781
01:19:41,520 --> 01:19:42,900
I tried it most of the term.

1782
01:19:43,830 --> 01:19:45,850
Do you struggle talking when you go 
onstage?

1783
01:19:46,200 --> 01:19:47,090
I,
uh,

1784
01:19:47,091 --> 01:19:48,000
yeah.
I,

1785
01:19:48,010 --> 01:19:51,020
uh,
I stutter or I lose my train of thought,

1786
01:19:51,050 --> 01:19:52,550
like if I'm going to like,
oh,

1787
01:19:52,551 --> 01:19:55,550
I didn't go to the app that bit now.
Then I'll like,

1788
01:19:55,551 --> 01:19:56,151
forget it.
I'm like,

1789
01:19:56,151 --> 01:19:56,591
wait,
what?

1790
01:19:56,591 --> 01:19:59,570
I,
I say just thinking it's memory for most

1791
01:19:59,571 --> 01:20:00,650
of me.
I think like,

1792
01:20:00,830 --> 01:20:02,300
especially with like pizza,
we'd,

1793
01:20:02,510 --> 01:20:03,343
I find that if I don't smoke weed,
I actually remember everything I did 

1794
01:20:06,171 --> 01:20:08,040
that night.
But I do smoke

1795
01:20:08,040 --> 01:20:08,580
pete,
we'd,

1796
01:20:08,580 --> 01:20:09,413
I don't remember anything I did that 
night and I used to always think it was 

1797
01:20:12,031 --> 01:20:13,340
alcohol based,
but I,

1798
01:20:13,350 --> 01:20:15,480
I've been trying and experimenting the 
Same way.

1799
01:20:15,840 --> 01:20:17,610
I remember everything.
I,

1800
01:20:18,390 --> 01:20:19,860
I smoke a lot of weeds,
weeds,

1801
01:20:19,980 --> 01:20:24,190
and it just blocks my memory.
Men in black kush.

1802
01:20:24,730 --> 01:20:25,930
The memory eraser.

1803
01:20:27,020 --> 01:20:27,853
Yeah.
Well it definitely has a different 

1804
01:20:28,351 --> 01:20:29,640
effect on everybody,
man.

1805
01:20:30,240 --> 01:20:32,310
There's no doubt about that because 
you'll,

1806
01:20:32,400 --> 01:20:35,010
you'll hear some people talk about pot 
and you're like,

1807
01:20:35,011 --> 01:20:38,430
what are you experiencing?
I almost want to be in your body.

1808
01:20:38,590 --> 01:20:42,970
I roasted snoop dogg a few weeks ago,
maybe like a little over a montH ago and

1809
01:20:42,971 --> 01:20:44,490
hanging out with him.
It was.

1810
01:20:44,560 --> 01:20:45,393
I've hunG out with them a few times,
but this time it was after I roasted a 

1811
01:20:48,611 --> 01:20:49,444
man.
I had hung out with them the day before 

1812
01:20:50,470 --> 01:20:51,303
because we were talking about the roast 
and I was helping him with his thing at 

1813
01:20:52,871 --> 01:20:54,250
the end and everything,
you know what I mean?

1814
01:20:54,670 --> 01:20:58,010
So we were smoking then and then after 
the roast and I lit his eye,

1815
01:20:58,011 --> 01:21:02,100
lit snoop up at this.
I made fun of everyone.

1816
01:21:02,320 --> 01:21:03,153
It waS really crazy,
like one of the most fun things I've 

1817
01:21:04,930 --> 01:21:06,700
ever done on stage.
Anyway.

1818
01:21:07,360 --> 01:21:10,690
Afterwards we were kicking it like hard 
fucking core,

1819
01:21:10,720 --> 01:21:12,550
right?
Because I had just like honored,

1820
01:21:12,730 --> 01:21:13,563
honored the shit out of them basically 
in front of all of his friends and this 

1821
01:21:16,001 --> 01:21:18,700
big cool theater in la.
So you know,

1822
01:21:18,760 --> 01:21:19,593
we were hanging out all this stuff and 
it ever since then he inspired me to 

1823
01:21:22,361 --> 01:21:23,200
smoke more weed.

1824
01:21:23,200 --> 01:21:24,033
Not by saying anything,
but just sort of like watching them 

1825
01:21:25,811 --> 01:21:26,644
operate anD just realizing like wow,
this guy just stays laughing anD 

1826
01:21:33,161 --> 01:21:37,270
creative all the time because it never 
shuts off for them.

1827
01:21:37,271 --> 01:21:38,104
Every time I've ever been around him,
he's always just riff in and always the 

1828
01:21:41,261 --> 01:21:42,094
funny by far,
the funniest comedian I've ever met or 

1829
01:21:45,041 --> 01:21:48,130
worked with by far.
You ever hang out with snoop?

1830
01:21:48,160 --> 01:21:48,993
No.
Never meT him.

1831
01:21:49,840 --> 01:21:54,010
You would fucking love him.
You guys would click.

1832
01:21:54,540 --> 01:21:59,500
You guys were crossing the streams would
be unbelievable because he's,

1833
01:21:59,590 --> 01:22:00,550
he gets it,
man.

1834
01:22:00,610 --> 01:22:01,443
He's cool as fuck him.
And Martha Stewart is the best 

1835
01:22:03,401 --> 01:22:06,250
combination in the room.
Don't they have on your show?

1836
01:22:06,460 --> 01:22:07,293
Yeah.
Together.

1837
01:22:07,670 --> 01:22:09,940
Cooking show together.
What is it best combo?

1838
01:22:10,540 --> 01:22:11,373
Um,
they just have a killer cooking show 

1839
01:22:12,431 --> 01:22:14,250
together.
And is it on tv?

1840
01:22:14,251 --> 01:22:14,950
Yeah.
Yeah.

1841
01:22:14,950 --> 01:22:16,810
That's one of the regular.
A regular show.

1842
01:22:17,090 --> 01:22:18,280
And you know who you know,
who does it?

1843
01:22:18,370 --> 01:22:19,450
Oh,
chris mcguire.

1844
01:22:19,900 --> 01:22:20,740
No shit.
Yeah.

1845
01:22:20,800 --> 01:22:24,580
Really one of the roast jokes that I 
didn't snoop was he,

1846
01:22:24,581 --> 01:22:25,414
that he has a cooking show with martha 
and when asked what it's like to work 

1847
01:22:27,971 --> 01:22:30,970
with a 75 year old lady,
martha said not that bad.

1848
01:22:31,130 --> 01:22:32,860
Ah,

1849
01:22:33,270 --> 01:22:34,103
it's amazing though,
like I've seen the clip of like I just 

1850
01:22:36,451 --> 01:22:39,060
put it up on youtube a couple of days 
ago and uh,

1851
01:22:39,990 --> 01:22:43,020
already tweeted about it and,
but ever since watching it have actually

1852
01:22:43,021 --> 01:22:43,854
having the clip and getting,
when it cuts back every time it cuts 

1853
01:22:46,411 --> 01:22:47,244
back to snoop laughing.
I still like my brain is like I can't 

1854
01:22:50,630 --> 01:22:51,463
fuck.
I still can't believe that it happened 

1855
01:22:53,490 --> 01:22:55,230
like that,
that snoop laughing.

1856
01:22:55,231 --> 01:22:55,890
Right,
right.

1857
01:22:55,890 --> 01:22:58,890
That you actually did rose.
It's so fucking weird.

1858
01:22:58,920 --> 01:23:00,270
Wow.
But anyway,

1859
01:23:00,271 --> 01:23:05,271
I've doubled my pot intake since this 
snoop thing and I was already,

1860
01:23:05,501 --> 01:23:08,080
you know,
a very regular daily,

1861
01:23:08,081 --> 01:23:09,040
pretty much,
you know,

1862
01:23:09,041 --> 01:23:12,070
once I get the bulk of work done in the 
afternoon,

1863
01:23:12,071 --> 01:23:14,680
if it's,
whether I'm writing or just,

1864
01:23:14,681 --> 01:23:15,514
you know,
whatever I have to do or book or 

1865
01:23:17,381 --> 01:23:19,780
whatever responsibilities I have,
it's on,

1866
01:23:20,010 --> 01:23:21,520
you know,
until I'm a fan.

1867
01:23:21,670 --> 01:23:22,503
Yeah.
And then I woRk out a few hours later 

1868
01:23:24,070 --> 01:23:24,903
and then I do it again.
I just keep smoking throughout the 

1869
01:23:27,060 --> 01:23:27,893
night.
Okay,

1870
01:23:28,200 --> 01:23:29,280
good for you.
It works.

1871
01:23:29,281 --> 01:23:32,190
I approve this message.
It works for me.

1872
01:23:32,410 --> 01:23:34,500
Yeah.
Why not man?

1873
01:23:34,560 --> 01:23:35,393
As long as it works.
And if you decide at one point that it 

1874
01:23:38,041 --> 01:23:39,810
doesn't work anymore and you want to 
switch it up,

1875
01:23:39,811 --> 01:23:41,850
I mean sometimes that happens too in 
your life.

1876
01:23:42,090 --> 01:23:43,850
You get tired of a certain pattern.
Yeah.

1877
01:23:43,920 --> 01:23:44,753
You know,
it might be a different kind of workout 

1878
01:23:46,531 --> 01:23:50,250
you're doing or whatever it is,
but just changing things a little bit,

1879
01:23:50,520 --> 01:23:53,190
changing certain aspects of your life.
Just a little bit,

1880
01:23:53,191 --> 01:23:55,380
just a little bit of a turn,
a little deviation,

1881
01:23:55,381 --> 01:23:57,330
something new,
little something different.

1882
01:23:57,810 --> 01:23:59,730
It can be huge,
huge for your brain,

1883
01:24:00,170 --> 01:24:02,010
you know,
start thinking of things different.

1884
01:24:02,520 --> 01:24:05,010
I madE,
I emptied my house out recently,

1885
01:24:05,070 --> 01:24:05,903
just decided to pack everything up.
I got a storage unit and I put 

1886
01:24:08,581 --> 01:24:10,680
everything in the storage unit.
It's weird though.

1887
01:24:11,130 --> 01:24:14,250
We were talking at kill tony,
about how people lived in their cars.

1888
01:24:14,790 --> 01:24:15,623
I didn't know that there's a whole thing
of homeless people that have storage 

1889
01:24:19,231 --> 01:24:20,064
units and they used the storage unit to 
bathe in and they just hang out there 

1890
01:24:23,761 --> 01:24:24,594
all day then.
Thank god there's a shadow warehouse 

1891
01:24:26,550 --> 01:24:27,480
storage june.
No,

1892
01:24:27,481 --> 01:24:27,781
no,
no.

1893
01:24:27,781 --> 01:24:30,360
They'll just come there with like wet 
naps and like we,

1894
01:24:30,410 --> 01:24:33,090
like they were showing me my unit when I
got it,

1895
01:24:33,140 --> 01:24:38,040
me and jan and she goes,
oh we can't go down this hallway.

1896
01:24:38,041 --> 01:24:38,600
And I'm like,
why?

1897
01:24:38,600 --> 01:24:39,750
She goes,
just hold your nose.

1898
01:24:39,751 --> 01:24:40,584
We can't go down this hallway.
And I and I look ahead and there was a 

1899
01:24:43,411 --> 01:24:47,390
woman naked like washing herself and 
poop rags everywhere.

1900
01:24:47,410 --> 01:24:49,920
Just rags on the ground with poop on it 
everywhere.

1901
01:24:50,370 --> 01:24:51,203
And it smelled like poop.
And she said that she just lives there 

1902
01:24:54,961 --> 01:24:55,620
during the day.

1903
01:24:55,620 --> 01:24:57,960
That's like how she shits on the ground.
They let her,

1904
01:24:57,970 --> 01:25:01,440
she can't throw her out.
There's nothing they can do.

1905
01:25:01,670 --> 01:25:02,503
You can't like get her for like some 
sort of a health code sitting on the 

1906
01:25:05,311 --> 01:25:06,150
ground.
That's what I said.

1907
01:25:06,151 --> 01:25:06,984
And she goes,
you would think you would think it's 

1908
01:25:08,251 --> 01:25:13,251
very weird and touchy and it's funny how
much people like try to protect people.

1909
01:25:14,560 --> 01:25:16,590
Like if she had a house you could arrest
her for that.

1910
01:25:16,830 --> 01:25:19,050
Like if she had a house and she just 
wants to shit in public.

1911
01:25:19,110 --> 01:25:21,300
I like to go to my storage unit and take
shits on the floor.

1912
01:25:21,510 --> 01:25:22,343
People would say,
you fucking dirty bitch like you to go 

1913
01:25:24,631 --> 01:25:27,040
to jail,
but because she doesn't have a house and

1914
01:25:27,130 --> 01:25:28,740
she goes there and shits on the floor 
like,

1915
01:25:28,741 --> 01:25:29,770
oh,
we can't do anything.

1916
01:25:29,820 --> 01:25:29,960
It.

1917
01:25:29,960 --> 01:25:30,793
It's also the location.
There's this California culture where 

1918
01:25:32,751 --> 01:25:33,584
that we nurture people,
but like if that was in Texas and some 

1919
01:25:35,571 --> 01:25:37,110
storage unit owner walked by,

1920
01:25:38,650 --> 01:25:42,690
you better pick up and put your.
When you put your pooper exit way,

1921
01:25:43,710 --> 01:25:44,543
you get it up and you get out of here.
Right now I just got to say that is so 

1922
01:25:47,471 --> 01:25:49,570
much better than your japanese mexican 
accent.

1923
01:25:49,690 --> 01:25:52,840
You have a two days to pack up and get 
up to the storage unit,

1924
01:25:54,340 --> 01:25:56,620
back up and get down to theater.
This is Texas.

1925
01:25:56,650 --> 01:25:59,620
Nothing's like san francisco.
San francisco is the worst when it comes

1926
01:25:59,621 --> 01:26:00,454
to that.
There's fucking aggressive homeless 

1927
01:26:01,181 --> 01:26:02,950
people everywhere.
Somebody took all.

1928
01:26:03,500 --> 01:26:04,070
Somebody took

1929
01:26:04,070 --> 01:26:08,810
a huge shit human shit right in front of
the punchline comedy club.

1930
01:26:08,900 --> 01:26:09,733
It was.
I didn't know it did because I filmed 

1931
01:26:16,191 --> 01:26:17,024
it.
I periscoped two videos of it and in I 

1932
01:26:18,681 --> 01:26:20,480
can just save any photos.
I can see right now.

1933
01:26:20,500 --> 01:26:25,500
Video is on photos and video.
I got video of me so it's hard to see in

1934
01:26:26,271 --> 01:26:27,104
the video,
but it was,

1935
01:26:27,700 --> 01:26:29,370
but it made me puke.
Okay.

1936
01:26:30,000 --> 01:26:31,700
A little towel next to it.

1937
01:26:31,750 --> 01:26:32,583
Yeah,
man.

1938
01:26:32,740 --> 01:26:33,573
I've never seen more homeless people 
just wandering around anywhere in any 

1939
01:26:37,451 --> 01:26:39,280
one location that I have in san 
francisco.

1940
01:26:39,490 --> 01:26:41,440
It seems like they're just super 
tolerant up there.

1941
01:26:42,160 --> 01:26:42,993
It's one of the things that make san 
francisco awesome is that open 

1942
01:26:45,281 --> 01:26:46,900
mindedness and tolerance,
but

1943
01:26:47,270 --> 01:26:49,880
we were there.
It also leaves an opening for that.

1944
01:26:49,881 --> 01:26:52,790
We were there on saturday when they were
doing the marches up there.

1945
01:26:52,880 --> 01:26:53,790
Oh,
it was a good times.

1946
01:26:53,900 --> 01:26:56,540
It was powerful.
Drained the.

1947
01:26:56,650 --> 01:26:58,400
Well,
the kill tony show was amazing,

1948
01:26:58,401 --> 01:27:01,020
but the to standup shows I had after 
that you could tell and I.

1949
01:27:01,190 --> 01:27:02,023
By the second show I was asking like how
many you went to the march earlier and 

1950
01:27:04,221 --> 01:27:06,020
it was just like.
I mean,

1951
01:27:06,080 --> 01:27:07,510
wow.
Raised.

1952
01:27:07,511 --> 01:27:09,290
Have you ever even heard,

1953
01:27:09,650 --> 01:27:14,650
have an elected leader that's been 
protested this hard right after they got

1954
01:27:14,961 --> 01:27:16,890
an office before they've done anything?
Now

1955
01:27:17,950 --> 01:27:21,370
the funny thing is there was a bunch of 
women out there obviously that voted for

1956
01:27:21,371 --> 01:27:24,360
trump or didn't vote at all.
That's what the,

1957
01:27:24,370 --> 01:27:25,203
a lot of the numbers would say because 
they said that most women voted for 

1958
01:27:28,781 --> 01:27:29,614
trump.
Right?

1959
01:27:30,100 --> 01:27:31,120
Isn't that a style?
No.

1960
01:27:31,130 --> 01:27:31,963
Okay.
Most of the women that voted voted for 

1961
01:27:33,431 --> 01:27:34,270
trump,
correct?

1962
01:27:34,271 --> 01:27:35,090
Well,
no,

1963
01:27:35,090 --> 01:27:35,830
no.
I thought I heard.

1964
01:27:35,830 --> 01:27:36,250
No,
no,

1965
01:27:36,250 --> 01:27:39,460
no,
no more women voted For trump than voted

1966
01:27:39,461 --> 01:27:40,294
for hillary.
But not most of the women voted for 

1967
01:27:41,891 --> 01:27:42,724
trump.
So if like there's a hundred and three 

1968
01:27:45,251 --> 01:27:48,430
women,
53 of them voted for trump,

1969
01:27:48,460 --> 01:27:50,680
50 of them voted for hillary.
Really fat kind of a deal.

1970
01:27:51,700 --> 01:27:55,000
but when you're talking about the 
numbers that they had,

1971
01:27:55,001 --> 01:27:59,260
like an la whitney coming sent me this 
picture and uh,

1972
01:27:59,261 --> 01:28:00,790
I looked at,
I wonder what in the fuck,

1973
01:28:00,791 --> 01:28:01,810
where is that?
She goes,

1974
01:28:01,811 --> 01:28:03,460
that's in downtown la.
I'm like,

1975
01:28:03,461 --> 01:28:05,320
that is insane.
I'm like,

1976
01:28:05,321 --> 01:28:06,640
That's insane.
I go,

1977
01:28:06,641 --> 01:28:07,780
how many people are there?
She goes,

1978
01:28:07,990 --> 01:28:12,600
they expected 80,000
and they got 900,000

1979
01:28:12,630 --> 01:28:16,330
is the biggest one.
Even bigger than dc.

1980
01:28:16,660 --> 01:28:17,493
Yeah.
She said they,

1981
01:28:17,540 --> 01:28:19,420
they don't even really.
They don't really know how many,

1982
01:28:19,421 --> 01:28:23,350
but she says they think somewhere around
I think 970,000

1983
01:28:23,351 --> 01:28:26,920
people close to a million credible.

1984
01:28:27,710 --> 01:28:28,543
Crazy.
And it was interesting how many older 

1985
01:28:30,470 --> 01:28:35,210
ladies and older women didn't like.
I flew back and the woman next to me was

1986
01:28:35,211 --> 01:28:38,780
an old lady that sprayed her hair blue 
and she's like,

1987
01:28:38,781 --> 01:28:40,320
well you got up to protest.

1988
01:28:42,330 --> 01:28:44,350
I think this all came from the grab the 
pussy stuff.

1989
01:28:44,351 --> 01:28:46,060
Like if he didn't have the grab them by 
the pussy stuff.

1990
01:28:46,061 --> 01:28:47,170
This wouldn't exist.
Right.

1991
01:28:47,750 --> 01:28:48,583
It's because of one clip that they dug 
up from the early nineties in between a 

1992
01:28:51,431 --> 01:28:52,264
commercial break with him on inside 
edition with some guy talking about who 

1993
01:28:55,691 --> 01:28:58,030
knows the context that was happening 
before that before

1994
01:28:58,290 --> 01:28:59,400
and his,
his,

1995
01:28:59,401 --> 01:29:02,040
his whole.
If You him talk

1996
01:29:02,070 --> 01:29:05,330
his whole persona like shona.

1997
01:29:05,460 --> 01:29:06,293
Yeah.
And he's Talking about your son is the 

1998
01:29:07,201 --> 01:29:10,050
mexican word for it.
you may know him.

1999
01:29:10,051 --> 01:29:13,300
He's from jerusalem.
It's very,

2000
01:29:13,800 --> 01:29:14,300
very good

2001
01:29:14,300 --> 01:29:15,133
guy.
Jockey like he is buying is very 

2002
01:29:17,961 --> 01:29:20,070
negative for women.
Yeah.

2003
01:29:20,410 --> 01:29:24,080
He's a good old boys' club guy.
it's awful too for me to.

2004
01:29:24,790 --> 01:29:26,300
I don't.
Why is it awful for you?

2005
01:29:26,301 --> 01:29:29,630
I just don't like it.
I just don't like hearing him talk,

2006
01:29:29,631 --> 01:29:32,420
man.
He's just such a to me.

2007
01:29:32,620 --> 01:29:35,900
Like I don't like them.
Who kid though?

2008
01:29:36,570 --> 01:29:38,250
No,
I voted for weed,

2009
01:29:38,251 --> 01:29:41,180
but I didn't vote for trump or didn't 
vote for president.

2010
01:29:41,181 --> 01:29:43,730
you got to that and you just left it out
now because I didn't like either.

2011
01:29:43,731 --> 01:29:45,480
I wouldn't have had a,
you know,

2012
01:29:45,560 --> 01:29:47,730
old man mickey.
Hmm.

2013
01:29:48,770 --> 01:29:52,280
Interesting.
Did you vote for Gary Johnson?

2014
01:29:52,281 --> 01:29:53,750
Did my podcast.
I voted for him.

2015
01:29:56,000 --> 01:30:00,320
He seems like a throwaway.
I'd really rather not vote and that

2016
01:30:00,480 --> 01:30:02,160
brian,
it's never a throwaway.

2017
01:30:02,190 --> 01:30:04,380
If everybody voted for Gary Johnson,
he would won.

2018
01:30:04,420 --> 01:30:05,700
Yeah,
but that wasn't gonna happen.

2019
01:30:05,730 --> 01:30:08,160
Well why not?
Because it's never a throwaway.

2020
01:30:08,190 --> 01:30:11,910
It's like you have to vote your mind.
Otherwise voting is pointless regardless

2021
01:30:11,911 --> 01:30:13,350
of whether or not you think you're 
throwing your vote away.

2022
01:30:13,351 --> 01:30:14,184
Like,
there's so many people that were saying 

2023
01:30:14,461 --> 01:30:17,190
that the reason why,
you know,

2024
01:30:17,250 --> 01:30:18,083
my,
my state was going to go to hillary 

2025
01:30:18,931 --> 01:30:20,580
clinton already.
So I already knew that,

2026
01:30:20,640 --> 01:30:21,473
right?
Most people predicted that if I stepped 

2027
01:30:23,041 --> 01:30:23,874
in as a complete objective observer,
I had never had anything to do with the 

2028
01:30:26,341 --> 01:30:27,174
system up until that point.
And then I walked in and they were 

2029
01:30:29,281 --> 01:30:30,114
telling me the projected victory was 
already to hillary clinton before it 

2030
01:30:33,031 --> 01:30:33,864
even started right in this state.
And they were right and they were right 

2031
01:30:36,331 --> 01:30:37,164
in New York.
Right.

2032
01:30:37,680 --> 01:30:40,350
So if I vote for Gary Johnson,
stopped throwing shit away,

2033
01:30:40,380 --> 01:30:43,470
it's just voting my conscience and it's 
not even really my conscience honestly,

2034
01:30:43,650 --> 01:30:46,950
because maybe gary's not the right guy 
for the job either.

2035
01:30:47,340 --> 01:30:49,140
You know what I mean?
He didn't know what aleppo waS,

2036
01:30:49,620 --> 01:30:50,820
but,
you know,

2037
01:30:50,821 --> 01:30:55,821
but bernie sanders isn't enough anymore 
and I'm not a big fan of hillary and uh,

2038
01:30:56,601 --> 01:30:57,840
um,
I don't think.

2039
01:30:57,960 --> 01:31:00,480
I'm not a big fan of trump.
I'm not a big fan of any.

2040
01:31:00,510 --> 01:31:02,760
I'm not a big fan of being president.
How about that?

2041
01:31:03,000 --> 01:31:04,290
I don't think anybody should be 
president.

2042
01:31:04,291 --> 01:31:05,124
Yeah,
I think there's an article that I 

2043
01:31:06,031 --> 01:31:06,864
tweeted recently that someone tweeted to
me and I retweeted it about having a 

2044
01:31:09,240 --> 01:31:12,090
council of wise people like seven or 
eight people

2045
01:31:12,380 --> 01:31:17,380
like star wars.
Was that jim,

2046
01:31:17,470 --> 01:31:21,460
this article on fortune.com
says that a 42 percent of women,

2047
01:31:21,461 --> 01:31:25,510
most of them white came out to support.
It came out to support trump.

2048
01:31:26,620 --> 01:31:27,850
Right.
But we weren't talking about that.

2049
01:31:27,851 --> 01:31:28,684
We.
We're talking about the marches against 

2050
01:31:29,291 --> 01:31:29,861
trump.
I know,

2051
01:31:29,861 --> 01:31:33,550
but I mean that's done.
Tony's point is that 42 percent of women

2052
01:31:33,551 --> 01:31:35,700
voted for him so that,
that.

2053
01:31:35,770 --> 01:31:36,603
You know what I mean?
How many women then were there that 

2054
01:31:38,141 --> 01:31:40,000
voted for trump?
ProBably none

2055
01:31:40,040 --> 01:31:42,140
because there's 20 million people in los
anGeles.

2056
01:31:42,380 --> 01:31:45,590
You have 20 million people in los 
angeles and you got less than a million.

2057
01:31:45,770 --> 01:31:47,930
It's highly likely that,
that less than a million.

2058
01:31:47,990 --> 01:31:48,823
I think a lot of secret trump supporters
should are disguising themselves as 

2059
01:31:53,161 --> 01:31:57,440
these people telling you they're out 
there because they have to these.

2060
01:31:58,530 --> 01:32:00,010
It's a game to

2061
01:32:00,010 --> 01:32:01,990
some of these people.
I can feel it.

2062
01:32:02,160 --> 01:32:02,993
What you think the people that are 
walking around in that rally actually 

2063
01:32:05,501 --> 01:32:07,330
voted for trump and they're holding up 
signs.

2064
01:32:07,331 --> 01:32:08,800
Fuck trump.
You really think that

2065
01:32:10,870 --> 01:32:11,291
I.
Yeah,

2066
01:32:11,291 --> 01:32:13,210
I think that some of them.
Yeah.

2067
01:32:13,240 --> 01:32:15,370
I think that their secret trump 
supporters.

2068
01:32:15,640 --> 01:32:16,780
Yeah,
aBsolutely.

2069
01:32:17,290 --> 01:32:19,810
Marching with signs the whole deal for 
their,

2070
01:32:19,840 --> 01:32:24,210
what they have to do for whatever their 
jobs are or whoever their bosses.

2071
01:32:24,340 --> 01:32:25,000
Yeah,
Sure.

2072
01:32:25,000 --> 01:32:27,370
Marchelle join yet the march.
Yeah.

2073
01:32:27,510 --> 01:32:28,121
Yeah,
sure.

2074
01:32:28,121 --> 01:32:28,954
Definitely.
As long as you talk to tom about that 

2075
01:32:31,181 --> 01:32:32,110
raise or whatever,
you know,

2076
01:32:32,111 --> 01:32:37,111
whatever the people do.
But it's crazy at that march.

2077
01:32:40,331 --> 01:32:42,370
There's like five year old girls,
you know,

2078
01:32:42,371 --> 01:32:43,204
they're there.
I mean these parents are mad about what 

2079
01:32:45,071 --> 01:32:45,904
the possibility of what of their kids.
Hearing something that trump said and 

2080
01:32:49,121 --> 01:32:51,660
there's like five year old girls walking
down the street going down,

2081
01:32:51,670 --> 01:32:53,270
catch my pussy.
Don't touch me.

2082
01:32:53,890 --> 01:32:56,420
Really true.
Do you really see five-year-old st?

2083
01:32:56,480 --> 01:32:57,313
Don't judge my.
The march was saying don't touch my 

2084
01:33:02,171 --> 01:33:03,004
pussy and there's little kids that yOu 
were saying that five-year-olds are 

2085
01:33:04,511 --> 01:33:08,110
saying that probably not fight.
Like here's,

2086
01:33:08,120 --> 01:33:08,953
here's my question.
Do you Think that having these gigantic 

2087
01:33:11,171 --> 01:33:13,150
marches all over the country like they 
did,

2088
01:33:13,270 --> 01:33:16,990
don't you think that's probably a good 
thing because a guy like trump,

2089
01:33:17,080 --> 01:33:20,170
the last thing he wants is all those 
people hating him.

2090
01:33:20,380 --> 01:33:23,680
The last thing he wants is to realize 
that there's never been a president ever

2091
01:33:23,860 --> 01:33:28,860
in the history of this country that has 
gotten protested so widely and so hugely

2092
01:33:31,420 --> 01:33:33,130
right after getting into office.
Right.

2093
01:33:33,510 --> 01:33:37,780
That's got to freak him out and that has
to affect the way you make decisions.

2094
01:33:37,781 --> 01:33:40,780
IT has to.
Knowing that these people like,

2095
01:33:40,930 --> 01:33:41,430
oh,
you,

2096
01:33:41,430 --> 01:33:43,180
you know,
you just got in,

2097
01:33:43,181 --> 01:33:44,014
you haven't done anything.
All you did was when the election again 

2098
01:33:45,551 --> 01:33:47,330
in,
it almost seems interesting to you

2099
01:33:47,370 --> 01:33:50,550
because what if that ends up turning him
into,

2100
01:33:50,551 --> 01:33:51,990
you know,
what if the.

2101
01:33:51,991 --> 01:33:55,860
I mean there's a chance with it.
He just turns on these people and starts

2102
01:33:55,920 --> 01:33:57,600
fulfilling the propheCy.
Right?

2103
01:33:58,730 --> 01:34:00,090
It's a weird thing,
but,

2104
01:34:00,110 --> 01:34:00,950
but then,
you know,

2105
01:34:00,951 --> 01:34:03,740
the republicans that support him that 
are on the fence,

2106
01:34:03,741 --> 01:34:07,640
they wouldn't support him anymore.
He's a populist and a lot of ways since.

2107
01:34:07,670 --> 01:34:09,290
One of the more interesting things about
this,

2108
01:34:09,291 --> 01:34:12,050
like he's willing to change his mind on 
things.

2109
01:34:12,410 --> 01:34:17,410
If the people are really vehemently 
against his decisions,

2110
01:34:18,760 --> 01:34:19,593
I think it's going to be real weird.
Who knows who the fuck knows what's 

2111
01:34:23,151 --> 01:34:25,420
going to happen,
but one of the things that I'm reading,

2112
01:34:25,421 --> 01:34:26,254
it's really fascinating is that they're 
trying to keep him away from television 

2113
01:34:29,120 --> 01:34:33,050
and criticism because he freaks out and 
then they don't want him to overreact.

2114
01:34:33,051 --> 01:34:36,740
TheY don't want him to respond to 
criticism of him because he keeps making

2115
01:34:36,741 --> 01:34:38,620
these fucking crazy tweets.
What's this?

2116
01:34:38,830 --> 01:34:39,663
His press secretary or somebody that 
just put out a thing the other day that 

2117
01:34:42,990 --> 01:34:46,180
was talking about the numbers.
How many people were at the at the thing

2118
01:34:46,390 --> 01:34:48,790
you know,
he's like a publicist though.

2119
01:34:48,850 --> 01:34:51,100
You know what I mean?
Like he's not even a press secretary.

2120
01:34:51,101 --> 01:34:54,910
This guy's a publicist.
They have a publicist because of how bad

2121
01:34:56,050 --> 01:34:57,740
trump is going to get into

2122
01:34:58,020 --> 01:34:59,340
trouble.
He's going to get into like,

2123
01:34:59,420 --> 01:35:02,840
that guy is going to be saving his ass a
lot in the future.

2124
01:35:02,841 --> 01:35:06,980
I feel my friend Jason Harrison,
he's the guy who owns this company.

2125
01:35:06,981 --> 01:35:08,530
That makes sense.
Cool.

2126
01:35:08,600 --> 01:35:13,560
You got 10 minutes.
Cotton mouth is that it is one of the.

2127
01:35:13,790 --> 01:35:16,730
Shut the fuck up with.
He's one of the best.

2128
01:35:16,731 --> 01:35:18,230
Uh,
he makes some of the best,

2129
01:35:18,231 --> 01:35:20,120
uh,
hunting gear in the world and he has his

2130
01:35:20,121 --> 01:35:20,954
picture on his instagram and this is 
disputing what the press is saying when 

2131
01:35:24,571 --> 01:35:26,360
they were talking about how little the 
crowd was.

2132
01:35:26,540 --> 01:35:27,373
Look how big the crowd is there.
This is an actual photo that he took 

2133
01:35:29,961 --> 01:35:32,420
with his actual phone and they were 
saying that the,

2134
01:35:32,421 --> 01:35:33,254
uh,
the crowd didn't go out to the press 

2135
01:35:33,981 --> 01:35:35,510
tent.
we'll fucking it clearly.

2136
01:35:35,511 --> 01:35:38,630
Does she?
That's a huge crowd.

2137
01:35:39,310 --> 01:35:40,920
It could also just be now.

2138
01:35:41,000 --> 01:35:42,620
What's that?
It could also just be the photo.

2139
01:35:42,621 --> 01:35:44,720
There could be like a brand.
Look at that photo.

2140
01:35:44,721 --> 01:35:45,554
That photo shows a gigantic crowd of 
people that goes all the way back past 

2141
01:35:49,041 --> 01:35:50,820
where they said the crowd didn't go.
I,

2142
01:35:50,940 --> 01:35:52,790
yeah.
I'm saying that there might be a big gap

2143
01:35:52,880 --> 01:35:56,150
in just how the photo is that you can't 
see that there's a gap in the middle,

2144
01:35:56,151 --> 01:35:56,930
you know,
kind of like this.

2145
01:35:56,930 --> 01:35:58,170
The whole thing.
Yeah.

2146
01:35:58,400 --> 01:36:00,590
but look what I do.
But look at what you're looking at.

2147
01:36:00,620 --> 01:36:03,680
Yeah.
Not in that photo and that photo you are

2148
01:36:03,681 --> 01:36:04,514
looking at.
look at all those people all the way 

2149
01:36:05,781 --> 01:36:06,614
back there.
They go all the way past the barricades 

2150
01:36:08,480 --> 01:36:10,070
looking at me.
People There are like,

2151
01:36:10,071 --> 01:36:12,260
that's not the pictures they showed on 
television.

2152
01:36:12,300 --> 01:36:13,200
Yeah.
So the.

2153
01:36:13,201 --> 01:36:18,090
And you can see these folks show Jason 
Harrisonj a s o n a,

2154
01:36:18,170 --> 01:36:19,003
m h a I r s t o n.
So this is a photo that he took himself 

2155
01:36:26,270 --> 01:36:27,103
and that's where it gets weird.
So like someone who was actually there 

2156
01:36:29,810 --> 01:36:32,650
who went to the inauguration,
they could take a picture of this.

2157
01:36:33,010 --> 01:36:33,843
This is photoj

2158
01:36:34,060 --> 01:36:36,400
pbs put up.
This is a time lapse from the top of the

2159
01:36:36,401 --> 01:36:38,800
Washington monument from the top.
From day,

2160
01:36:38,801 --> 01:36:41,170
like the time of day started like 
sunrise.

2161
01:36:41,260 --> 01:36:43,060
So everyone started leaving it.
Oh,

2162
01:36:43,061 --> 01:36:44,410
so they have all of it?
Yeah,

2163
01:36:44,411 --> 01:36:46,780
they have sky view of it.
Okay,

2164
01:36:46,781 --> 01:36:50,560
so his photo,
does it represent what this is saying?

2165
01:36:50,561 --> 01:36:53,560
There's gaps though.
See there's gaps in between.

2166
01:36:53,561 --> 01:36:55,570
The crowds was not filled in from that 
angle.

2167
01:36:55,571 --> 01:36:57,460
It.
It represents a big crowd,

2168
01:36:57,461 --> 01:37:00,110
but when you look at it from the top,
you can see like the gaps in the.

2169
01:37:00,400 --> 01:37:01,233
But either way,
there's a lot of people there but it 

2170
01:37:02,411 --> 01:37:04,840
wasn't.
I don't know if it was a million.

2171
01:37:05,760 --> 01:37:07,530
Yeah,
but either way it's a giant crowd,

2172
01:37:07,531 --> 01:37:10,010
but it's nowhere near as many that went 
to see obama,

2173
01:37:10,080 --> 01:37:13,440
that that's been proven by the amount of
people that take public transportation.

2174
01:37:13,441 --> 01:37:14,274
Right.
So thIs is still not filled in yet and 

2175
01:37:15,541 --> 01:37:18,650
it's still.
See I.

2176
01:37:19,130 --> 01:37:20,730
If you're,
if you're standing,

2177
01:37:20,900 --> 01:37:23,100
if there's a bunch of people missing in 
the middle,

2178
01:37:23,130 --> 01:37:23,963
you're not going to be in the tail 
because the people behind it's going to 

2179
01:37:25,411 --> 01:37:28,350
fill in the gaps.
That does look pretty goddamn packed.

2180
01:37:28,590 --> 01:37:30,630
It does,
but maybe that's what you're saying.

2181
01:37:30,631 --> 01:37:34,710
Then because of that,
it really in your head,

2182
01:37:34,980 --> 01:37:35,813
it's hard to imagine what obama's 
must've looked like because that does 

2183
01:37:38,581 --> 01:37:39,414
look insane,
but he wasn't where we were when obama 

2184
01:37:41,851 --> 01:37:42,684
was inaugurated.
He wasn't there taking pictures in the 

2185
01:37:44,581 --> 01:37:45,414
same spot.
Then we would get a chance to really 

2186
01:37:47,251 --> 01:37:49,620
check to really check it and understand 
it,

2187
01:37:49,890 --> 01:37:50,723
but I mean that I would buy more than 
this because of what you said about 

2188
01:37:55,441 --> 01:37:56,130
perspective.

2189
01:37:56,130 --> 01:37:56,963
Yeah.

2190
01:37:58,020 --> 01:37:59,940
I mean there's still a fuck load of 
people,

2191
01:37:59,941 --> 01:38:00,774
man.
They were making it seem like there 

2192
01:38:01,591 --> 01:38:04,500
wasn't that many people.
That's a lot of god damn people.

2193
01:38:05,250 --> 01:38:06,083
It's just not as many as obama.
I would like to compare that to when 

2194
01:38:08,161 --> 01:38:09,900
bush was inaugurated,
bush had more.

2195
01:38:10,300 --> 01:38:11,270
Bush had more.
Yeah,

2196
01:38:13,670 --> 01:38:15,950
it was raining and the trump 
inauguration.

2197
01:38:16,040 --> 01:38:16,873
That's true.
And how many of those people were hair 

2198
01:38:18,630 --> 01:38:21,150
spray in respect to Mr.
Trump.

2199
01:38:21,240 --> 01:38:24,630
I saw point someone made to that at the 
time in 2009.

2200
01:38:24,631 --> 01:38:26,970
I guess when obama,
when the inauguration happened,

2201
01:38:26,971 --> 01:38:29,790
there are a lot more people out of work.
Oh shit.

2202
01:38:29,910 --> 01:38:32,470
and that now there's people that have 
jobs and they had less.

2203
01:38:32,510 --> 01:38:37,500
There's a white house,
propaganda welfare baby statement.

2204
01:38:37,520 --> 01:38:38,353
help sincerely.
Obama tried to find out how many people 

2205
01:38:42,001 --> 01:38:42,834
were there when bush was inaugurated and
how many people were there when clinton 

2206
01:38:46,441 --> 01:38:48,330
was inaugurated and there's a good 
thousand bushel.

2207
01:38:48,360 --> 01:38:49,860
What's that?
Two thousand one.

2208
01:38:49,861 --> 01:38:50,521
The first.
First one,

2209
01:38:50,521 --> 01:38:52,280
right?
Yeah,

2210
01:38:52,290 --> 01:38:55,350
it was 2000.
There was a good photoshop out there.

2211
01:38:55,410 --> 01:38:57,740
It shows overall shows,
reptiles.

2212
01:38:57,741 --> 01:38:59,880
It shows you their illness shape of a 
skull.

2213
01:38:59,940 --> 01:39:00,773
Alex jones,
did you hear he was at down there and 

2214
01:39:03,270 --> 01:39:04,103
somebody,
some trump supporter or something like 

2215
01:39:05,851 --> 01:39:08,570
that and gotten a huge fight.
And then with alex?

2216
01:39:08,630 --> 01:39:09,180
No,
no.

2217
01:39:09,180 --> 01:39:10,013
Alex jones.
It was right next to it and had to call 

2218
01:39:11,131 --> 01:39:12,920
the police.
Oh,

2219
01:39:12,930 --> 01:39:15,690
I saw someone was saying that Alex Jones
had liquor on his breath.

2220
01:39:17,110 --> 01:39:21,350
He says he doesn't drink $200.
Three hundred thousand or so for 2000.

2221
01:39:21,370 --> 01:39:22,990
One for bush,
400,000

2222
01:39:22,991 --> 01:39:23,824
in 2005.
And then one point $8 million for Iraq 

2223
01:39:26,491 --> 01:39:29,370
in 2009 and 1 million in 2013.

2224
01:39:31,720 --> 01:39:35,560
In comparison,
bill clinton also had 800,093

2225
01:39:35,561 --> 01:39:40,270
and 250,097.
Damn two and only 250,097.

2226
01:39:40,300 --> 01:39:43,030
I mean the rain is going to deeply 
affect that though,

2227
01:39:43,060 --> 01:39:44,990
because it's all local people,
right?

2228
01:39:45,070 --> 01:39:46,640
I mean,
who does that?

2229
01:39:47,070 --> 01:39:49,150
A lot of people.
Jason harrison fluent for that.

2230
01:39:49,420 --> 01:39:53,620
Margaret murphy,
she flew in for that shifts the march.

2231
01:39:54,130 --> 01:39:56,450
Yeah,
but she flew in,

2232
01:39:59,930 --> 01:40:00,701
you know,
a lot of those.

2233
01:40:00,701 --> 01:40:02,290
That's another thing that goes against 
that.

2234
01:40:02,560 --> 01:40:04,900
A lot of those women that were marching,
they're marching in the rain.

2235
01:40:05,580 --> 01:40:06,160
You know,
the one that.

2236
01:40:06,160 --> 01:40:06,993
I mean,
that's why jeremiah watkins and his 

2237
01:40:08,381 --> 01:40:09,640
character.
Daisy watkins.

2238
01:40:09,641 --> 01:40:11,190
Yeah.
I like daisy.

2239
01:40:11,260 --> 01:40:13,320
I like his character.
Yeah.

2240
01:40:13,330 --> 01:40:14,163
That was amazing.
They all had raincoats on during the 

2241
01:40:16,241 --> 01:40:19,090
roast battle tonight or during the.
I'd rather kill tony tonight.

2242
01:40:19,790 --> 01:40:22,270
Represent those hillary supporters that 
went out in the rain.

2243
01:40:22,420 --> 01:40:26,500
Is it a big deal because of this?
The question of the size or the question

2244
01:40:26,501 --> 01:40:29,490
over the lining of the size.
lying of the size of size,

2245
01:40:29,590 --> 01:40:31,090
but he doesn't.
He wants to say,

2246
01:40:31,091 --> 01:40:35,320
this guy wants to say this is the 
largest crowd of any inauguration ever.

2247
01:40:35,380 --> 01:40:37,120
Clearly that's not true.
RIght?

2248
01:40:37,300 --> 01:40:39,460
That's fucked up.
That's clearly not true.

2249
01:40:39,520 --> 01:40:44,230
If it seems like a big ass crowd to me 
looking at that photo,

2250
01:40:44,440 --> 01:40:47,170
but I've never looked at a photo of the 
inauguration before,

2251
01:40:47,260 --> 01:40:50,560
so if you compare it to obama,
it's clearly still a big ass crop,

2252
01:40:50,770 --> 01:40:53,590
but it's definitely not the biggest 
ever,

2253
01:40:53,710 --> 01:40:54,310
so

2254
01:40:54,310 --> 01:40:58,480
that's not good when the fucking white 
house minister of propaganda sounds like

2255
01:40:58,481 --> 01:40:59,314
that guy from baghdad.
Remember at the beginning of the war 

2256
01:41:01,900 --> 01:41:04,570
there was some guy that was doing the 
baghdad population thing.

2257
01:41:04,860 --> 01:41:06,550
Remember that guy?
Who the fuck was that guy?

2258
01:41:06,750 --> 01:41:08,140
who is this more on outside of the door?

2259
01:41:10,040 --> 01:41:13,980
They're letting people downstairs just 
walk downstairs so they should keep that

2260
01:41:13,981 --> 01:41:15,900
door shut.
It's such a bad.

2261
01:41:16,530 --> 01:41:17,363
Who was that guy?
Remember that guy joe baghdad or 

2262
01:41:19,411 --> 01:41:21,010
something like that.
Remember that.

2263
01:41:21,011 --> 01:41:22,110
It was like.
It was a meme.

2264
01:41:22,410 --> 01:41:24,300
It was hilarious.
Was like when?

2265
01:41:24,360 --> 01:41:26,550
When the war started,
get the fuck outta here.

2266
01:41:26,551 --> 01:41:27,930
Jamie.
Kick these guys out of here.

2267
01:41:29,220 --> 01:41:34,220
God,
jesus christ it latin people.

2268
01:41:36,791 --> 01:41:41,360
Fuck with us.
Anyway.

2269
01:41:41,480 --> 01:41:43,970
Um,
there was a character that was,

2270
01:41:44,050 --> 01:41:47,210
um,
baghdad something.

2271
01:41:47,880 --> 01:41:49,280
God dammit.
What was his name?

2272
01:41:50,050 --> 01:41:51,680
I can't remember it.
Do you remember that?

2273
01:41:51,681 --> 01:41:53,540
And what was he saying?
He was the proper,

2274
01:41:53,541 --> 01:41:57,770
the minister of propaganda for Iraq 
before we invaded.

2275
01:41:58,310 --> 01:42:00,260
And he was always saying like,
you know,

2276
01:42:00,261 --> 01:42:02,840
the iraqi troops or destroy any american
that bob.

2277
01:42:03,320 --> 01:42:04,680
No,
baghdad.

2278
01:42:04,700 --> 01:42:09,700
Bob,
bob and his ridiculous true predictions.

2279
01:42:13,210 --> 01:42:15,290
This guy.
Yes.

2280
01:42:15,500 --> 01:42:17,630
That's the guy.
Bob.

2281
01:42:17,890 --> 01:42:18,910
Yeah.
He was a,

2282
01:42:18,940 --> 01:42:22,780
he looks like a bra on it.
Looked like saddam hussein before saddam

2283
01:42:22,781 --> 01:42:23,614
hussein went into hiding.
Remember they went into hiding and they 

2284
01:42:24,941 --> 01:42:27,090
found him in a whole.
Remember they pulled him out [inaudible]

2285
01:42:27,150 --> 01:42:27,983
and hung them on tv.
We watched them like everyone could see 

2286
01:42:30,731 --> 01:42:32,230
him get hung.
Remember?

2287
01:42:32,231 --> 01:42:34,930
You saw it on tHe internet is an amazing
fucking crazy.

2288
01:42:35,170 --> 01:42:36,280
But this baghdad.
Bob.

2289
01:42:36,281 --> 01:42:37,570
That's it.
It is baghdad.

2290
01:42:37,600 --> 01:42:38,270
Bob.
Yeah.

2291
01:42:38,270 --> 01:42:41,090
Did you watch a that saddam series on 
hbo?

2292
01:42:41,960 --> 01:42:42,793
No,
but what I'm sayinG is this baghdad bob 

2293
01:42:44,151 --> 01:42:44,984
guy.
This is essentially what the trump guys 

2294
01:42:47,121 --> 01:42:49,820
doing.
He's saying shit that everybody knows is

2295
01:42:49,821 --> 01:42:50,654
not true.
He's exaggerating in a way that 

2296
01:42:52,371 --> 01:42:53,204
everybody knows is not true,
and this is just the beginning of the 

2297
01:42:55,011 --> 01:42:55,844
administration.

2298
01:42:55,880 --> 01:42:58,140
His quote is,
my information was correct,

2299
01:42:58,141 --> 01:43:01,870
but my interpretations were not.
Remember that.

2300
01:43:02,600 --> 01:43:06,170
Who was saying that?
The fact that bob guys quote is,

2301
01:43:06,360 --> 01:43:09,510
oh,
but this way house guys should be fired.

2302
01:43:09,630 --> 01:43:12,630
Right?
That should be like a blatant firing,

2303
01:43:12,750 --> 01:43:13,583
right?
That start off a relationship with the 

2304
01:43:15,421 --> 01:43:17,010
american people with a big,
fat,

2305
01:43:17,011 --> 01:43:18,630
juicy lie like that.
Fired.

2306
01:43:18,920 --> 01:43:21,610
What about his speeches to he?
Didn't he say he was?

2307
01:43:21,660 --> 01:43:22,493
There was a picture of him handwriting 
his speeches and then he's blatantly 

2308
01:43:25,620 --> 01:43:28,830
ripped off the bain speech and the 
avatar speech too.

2309
01:43:30,860 --> 01:43:33,300
Speech close.
Did you see it?

2310
01:43:34,570 --> 01:43:39,570
The same thing to the people.
That's not a typical political speak.

2311
01:43:40,070 --> 01:43:45,070
Everybody that's a typical.
You're right back to you,

2312
01:43:46,771 --> 01:43:49,520
to the people.
People turn it into the bain thing.

2313
01:43:49,590 --> 01:43:52,220
I'm like,
I hope everybody's about it being

2314
01:43:52,610 --> 01:43:54,180
stolen,
like you know,

2315
01:43:54,510 --> 01:43:57,540
not plagiarize,
but it's the same thing.

2316
01:43:57,630 --> 01:43:59,460
The problem with it being the same 
thing,

2317
01:43:59,461 --> 01:44:02,520
is this what bain said before he fucking
went to destroy the city,

2318
01:44:02,880 --> 01:44:05,070
but you shouldn't say that shared when 
everybody knows.

2319
01:44:05,071 --> 01:44:06,180
That's what bain said.

2320
01:44:07,300 --> 01:44:08,133
That's true.
That's true.

2321
01:44:08,150 --> 01:44:10,970
There's supposed to be a guy much 
checkin for bain speak.

2322
01:44:11,550 --> 01:44:12,383
No,
but imagine if you were going to say 

2323
01:44:13,670 --> 01:44:14,230
something

2324
01:44:14,230 --> 01:44:16,810
cool to have a president that said 
something had been said

2325
01:44:16,920 --> 01:44:19,710
that you're ridiculous.
Give it back to you.

2326
01:44:20,480 --> 01:44:24,440
You're just that one.
Part of it is like a whole.

2327
01:44:24,480 --> 01:44:25,980
It was like a whole two or three 
sentences,

2328
01:44:25,981 --> 01:44:29,910
not just that phrase.
There is no way that guy has enough time

2329
01:44:29,911 --> 01:44:33,080
to write his fucking speech.
You know what?

2330
01:44:33,100 --> 01:44:38,070
He took a picture and of course my 
fucking.

2331
01:44:38,071 --> 01:44:41,520
You should add a quill shit.
I got down feather and an ink bottle.

2332
01:44:42,670 --> 01:44:46,780
Clearly trump likes to write his 
speeches while watching batman.

2333
01:44:47,280 --> 01:44:48,113
Maybe he was just writing notes on the 
speeches with a pen and so it wasn't a 

2334
01:44:51,661 --> 01:44:52,530
lie.
Sort of,

2335
01:44:52,600 --> 01:44:53,340
kinda

2336
01:44:53,340 --> 01:44:56,340
cut through his next speech.
Dear white house press.

2337
01:44:56,460 --> 01:44:57,720
Why so serious?

2338
01:45:01,030 --> 01:45:02,080
Yeah,
we got a problem.

2339
01:45:02,200 --> 01:45:03,160
Um,
president trump.

2340
01:45:03,161 --> 01:45:06,970
Were you watching that man with heath 
ledger last night?

2341
01:45:07,720 --> 01:45:08,560
Yes.

2342
01:45:08,640 --> 01:45:09,900
It's going to be real weird,
man.

2343
01:45:10,470 --> 01:45:12,900
It's going to be real weird.
If that's how it keeps up,

2344
01:45:13,770 --> 01:45:15,510
maybe there'll be an adjustment.
Who knows?

2345
01:45:15,650 --> 01:45:16,483
Can you imagine how cool it would be if 
it was revealed that he did have a 

2346
01:45:18,591 --> 01:45:20,090
breathing problem all of a sudden

2347
01:45:20,190 --> 01:45:23,650
and had to wear some fucking mask.
How awesome.

2348
01:45:26,990 --> 01:45:29,390
The avatar part is not,
not true.

2349
01:45:29,510 --> 01:45:31,250
That wasn't set in avatar.
Well,

2350
01:45:31,251 --> 01:45:32,084
we already discussed who snopes is.
Who's running the guy that married a 

2351
01:45:35,130 --> 01:45:37,160
cowgirl.
I don't understand that.

2352
01:45:37,161 --> 01:45:39,140
I still think it's a.
It's pretty good.

2353
01:45:40,010 --> 01:45:42,380
It's pretty good snow girl.
Okay.

2354
01:45:42,381 --> 01:45:43,214
But you have to listen to you.
This one guy behind this thing 

2355
01:45:46,670 --> 01:45:47,503
obviously,
well guy and his wife and they got 

2356
01:45:49,281 --> 01:45:53,120
divorced and now he's a guy and a former
escort and they,

2357
01:45:53,121 --> 01:45:53,954
uh,
they still run it and they have a very 

2358
01:45:55,040 --> 01:45:57,740
clear left wing bias.
It's a very.

2359
01:45:58,270 --> 01:46:03,270
They've been a part of like anti bush 
rallies in the past and so I get it.

2360
01:46:03,620 --> 01:46:06,290
It's good to have something like that.
I'm not totally dismissing it,

2361
01:46:06,291 --> 01:46:07,124
but these are just people.
This isn't like objective academics who 

2362
01:46:09,771 --> 01:46:12,830
have combed the land and looked for the 
correct answer all the time.

2363
01:46:13,070 --> 01:46:16,550
There's stuff is widely criticized.
I don't always agree with the criticism,

2364
01:46:16,551 --> 01:46:17,384
but it's not like they're the end all be
all when it comes to truth is what's 

2365
01:46:20,631 --> 01:46:21,730
real on the internet.
No,

2366
01:46:21,731 --> 01:46:22,564
no,
but it's definitely a really good for 

2367
01:46:23,541 --> 01:46:24,374
like say like a hey,
they say these tacos are making it out 

2368
01:46:26,241 --> 01:46:29,180
of horses and then they and they go,
here's an article,

2369
01:46:29,181 --> 01:46:30,130
here's an article.
Yet god,

2370
01:46:30,131 --> 01:46:34,340
thanks noax.
Some shit that was going on in a leading

2371
01:46:34,341 --> 01:46:37,610
up to the election that was pretty 
criticized fund.

2372
01:46:37,810 --> 01:46:38,643
I criticisms of snopes.
See if you find anything that's any 

2373
01:46:40,431 --> 01:46:40,700
good.

2374
01:46:40,700 --> 01:46:41,533
I found a great thing that a university 
put together of how bias each thing is 

2375
01:46:47,211 --> 01:46:48,980
and which direction.
Everything leans.

2376
01:46:48,990 --> 01:46:53,340
Like they went really deep into it and 
they made a really cool graph.

2377
01:46:53,850 --> 01:46:57,780
Then that middle part is mainstream and 
the higher up it is,

2378
01:46:57,870 --> 01:47:01,800
the more actual and factual everything 
is in the lower it is,

2379
01:47:01,801 --> 01:47:03,930
the more.
It's just like fake news,

2380
01:47:03,931 --> 01:47:08,220
like crap jargOn and the farther left it
means that leans liberal,

2381
01:47:08,250 --> 01:47:11,430
like there's crazy stuff over there.
And then the far right leans,

2382
01:47:11,431 --> 01:47:14,990
conservative and it has everything 
listed.

2383
01:47:15,050 --> 01:47:17,020
What's really fucked up is we don't 
have.

2384
01:47:17,170 --> 01:47:18,003
Cnn is hot dog shit.
If you're wondering like the fakest 

2385
01:47:20,950 --> 01:47:21,783
terrible news,
but it says that it's better than 

2386
01:47:23,770 --> 01:47:25,570
reading the news.
And what was the source of this?

2387
01:47:25,600 --> 01:47:29,910
Oh,
it's a fox from what this was.

2388
01:47:29,911 --> 01:47:32,530
Um,
this was a study dOne by.

2389
01:47:32,531 --> 01:47:36,460
I can't remember the college says one 
point 3 million views.

2390
01:47:36,461 --> 01:47:40,140
But um,
I like pbs or runners.

2391
01:47:40,410 --> 01:47:45,410
It's on edgar from the name of the 
person that posted it is wild.

2392
01:47:45,581 --> 01:47:48,040
You katon man.
Why you see a t?

2393
01:47:48,041 --> 01:47:49,360
A n,
m,

2394
01:47:49,361 --> 01:47:51,250
a n,
but it has one point,

2395
01:47:51,251 --> 01:47:52,450
3 million views.
Some school,

2396
01:47:52,451 --> 01:47:53,284
I can't remember the exact school.
I found this off reddit and then just 

2397
01:47:55,181 --> 01:47:56,014
snagged a screenshot,
a picture of it because I found it so 

2398
01:47:57,821 --> 01:47:58,654
amazing and it shows you everything.
Like basically bbc and npr is right in 

2399
01:48:02,681 --> 01:48:05,890
the middle.
Like it's like above tHe Washington post

2400
01:48:05,891 --> 01:48:06,724
above New York times above nbc.
And abc usa today and cnn way down at 

2401
01:48:10,991 --> 01:48:13,810
the bottom and it says that the 
economist,

2402
01:48:13,811 --> 01:48:14,644
the guardian,
the atlantic in the wall street journal 

2403
01:48:16,001 --> 01:48:21,001
are basically the best minimal partisan 
bias mainstream but still reputable.

2404
01:48:21,950 --> 01:48:22,783
well they say about the wall street 
journals because it deals with the 

2405
01:48:24,111 --> 01:48:24,944
financial markets and because you can't 
have just a clear editorial bias that 

2406
01:48:29,091 --> 01:48:31,220
leans one way or the other,
that's gonna affect business.

2407
01:48:31,310 --> 01:48:32,750
Like tHey're not going to tolerate that 
shit.

2408
01:48:33,210 --> 01:48:35,240
They want to know what the fuck is 
really going on.

2409
01:48:35,330 --> 01:48:37,920
Clean and clear without all your,
you know,

2410
01:48:38,000 --> 01:48:39,800
hippie logic thrown into it.

2411
01:48:40,910 --> 01:48:43,100
Yup.
What do you think about our t?

2412
01:48:43,190 --> 01:48:44,023
Is that with

2413
01:48:44,250 --> 01:48:46,840
rt Russia today?
No,

2414
01:48:46,940 --> 01:48:47,773
I'm mad.
It's owned by Russia at the end of the 

2415
01:48:49,440 --> 01:48:49,830
day.
You know,

2416
01:48:49,830 --> 01:48:54,830
you realize that like they've got some 
sort of an influence over them.

2417
01:48:54,871 --> 01:48:55,704
I don't know how much of an influence,
but I had lee camp on my podcast and I 

2418
01:48:58,621 --> 01:49:01,440
was asking him whether or not I'm 
putting uses fillers.

2419
01:49:01,740 --> 01:49:05,220
That dude fucking clamped up.
He didn't want to say a word fillers.

2420
01:49:05,250 --> 01:49:08,550
Fillers like on his face,
like his face is looking.

2421
01:49:08,940 --> 01:49:10,590
It looks like someone's doing something 
to his face,

2422
01:49:10,591 --> 01:49:14,400
like botox or something.
Then he just clamped up.

2423
01:49:16,380 --> 01:49:19,320
Whereas I've had,
uh,

2424
01:49:19,380 --> 01:49:20,213
abby martin on the show before and she 
used to work for Russia today and she 

2425
01:49:23,491 --> 01:49:24,324
just decided not to do it anymore.
She's doing her own thing now and she 

2426
01:49:26,881 --> 01:49:31,020
was doing it.
She was a reporting on the,

2427
01:49:31,021 --> 01:49:32,460
uh,
the situation,

2428
01:49:32,461 --> 01:49:36,450
Ukraine and they wanted a shipper to 
Ukraine feel like,

2429
01:49:36,451 --> 01:49:37,850
yeah,
why don't you go check it out.

2430
01:49:38,080 --> 01:49:40,200
We're going to send her there and she's 
going to go there on the ground.

2431
01:49:40,410 --> 01:49:42,240
She's like,
the fuck I am.

2432
01:49:42,450 --> 01:49:43,283
She's like,
I'm not going to Russia or you create 

2433
01:49:44,750 --> 01:49:47,500
out of your fucking mind.
And that's when she realized like,

2434
01:49:47,530 --> 01:49:47,980
oh,
I got to

2435
01:49:47,980 --> 01:49:52,980
get out of this business because he was 
criticizing them Russia today.

2436
01:49:56,170 --> 01:49:56,710
It's,
uh,

2437
01:49:56,710 --> 01:49:57,543
it's interesting,
but it's probably a better news source 

2438
01:50:00,850 --> 01:50:04,390
than what you're getting from the 
America propaganda networks to this bad.

2439
01:50:04,391 --> 01:50:06,760
I watched post debate,
um,

2440
01:50:06,761 --> 01:50:11,200
I watched cnn and fox news and I went 
back and forth for a couple of hours.

2441
01:50:11,201 --> 01:50:13,450
I decided this is going to be like my 
project for the night.

2442
01:50:13,480 --> 01:50:14,313
I'm going to see What the left is saying
that I'm going to see what the right is 

2443
01:50:16,181 --> 01:50:17,650
saying.
It was crazy.

2444
01:50:17,860 --> 01:50:18,693
It was like to alternate realities.
Two completely different worlds and it 

2445
01:50:21,461 --> 01:50:24,700
was so biased on both sides.
There is so biased.

2446
01:50:25,060 --> 01:50:29,320
There's no one who's saying anything 
that might make the other side look good

2447
01:50:29,470 --> 01:50:30,303
or it might soften someone's point of 
view or get hillary clinton is a fief 

2448
01:50:35,020 --> 01:50:35,853
and a liar and she's profiting and the 
clinton foundation is a problem and she 

2449
01:50:39,731 --> 01:50:40,564
needs to go to jail and anybody else 
would be in jail and taxes and this and 

2450
01:50:43,391 --> 01:50:44,224
that and fucking real estate scandals 
and and then you go to the other side 

2451
01:50:46,930 --> 01:50:50,320
and it's all sexual assault.
Donald trump's sexual assault,

2452
01:50:50,380 --> 01:50:54,370
choose of sexual assault.
A woman accuses him of sexual assault.

2453
01:50:54,610 --> 01:50:57,670
This video,
the grab the pussy video and like it was

2454
01:50:57,671 --> 01:50:59,160
all concentrating on that

2455
01:50:59,190 --> 01:51:03,180
and that's another crazy thing about 
this study is that comparatively,

2456
01:51:03,270 --> 01:51:04,103
according to this huge crazy study that 
they did fox news while being while 

2457
01:51:09,241 --> 01:51:12,270
completely leaning right,
but still reputable,

2458
01:51:12,300 --> 01:51:17,070
cnn is not and can just not reputable at
all.

2459
01:51:17,340 --> 01:51:19,290
Wow.
Bottom of everything,

2460
01:51:19,291 --> 01:51:21,540
but they say better than not reading 
news at all,

2461
01:51:21,541 --> 01:51:22,374
but

2462
01:51:22,930 --> 01:51:23,763
send me,
take a screenshot of that and send that 

2463
01:51:25,791 --> 01:51:27,920
to me and send me to with the guy's name
on it.

2464
01:51:27,921 --> 01:51:30,290
I'm going to put it on my instagram and 
give that guy interesting.

2465
01:51:30,291 --> 01:51:34,400
Nbc.
Nbc is in the middle with the Washington

2466
01:51:34,401 --> 01:51:35,180
post.
Well,

2467
01:51:35,180 --> 01:51:37,400
Brian Williams made sure of that.
In fact,

2468
01:51:37,401 --> 01:51:38,780
he went to battle for it.

2469
01:51:38,840 --> 01:51:40,100
Well,
msnbc.

2470
01:51:40,101 --> 01:51:40,934
Yeah.
Is the one that they're saying is the 

2471
01:51:42,501 --> 01:51:46,580
fox news of the left basically,
but still sort of there,

2472
01:51:46,690 --> 01:51:48,860
but they're more,
much more according to this.

2473
01:51:48,861 --> 01:51:50,900
Much more reputable than cnn.

2474
01:51:51,130 --> 01:51:53,090
That's rachel maddow.
Yeah,

2475
01:51:54,880 --> 01:51:55,713
she gets.
She gets a little bit crazy to just a 

2476
01:51:56,801 --> 01:51:59,500
big old lesbian running that show.
I love it.

2477
01:52:00,430 --> 01:52:01,263
I love the fact that you could have a 
clear and obvious short haired lesbian 

2478
01:52:04,421 --> 01:52:06,940
woman with a,
you know,

2479
01:52:07,000 --> 01:52:10,420
ivy league education being like your 
mouthpiece.

2480
01:52:10,450 --> 01:52:15,040
Like she's the main dude over there.
It is.

2481
01:52:15,340 --> 01:52:18,130
And then you have that keith overman 
guys gone bananas.

2482
01:52:18,160 --> 01:52:19,750
He's just insane.
Yeah.

2483
01:52:19,810 --> 01:52:22,010
And another thing.
Well he's like,

2484
01:52:22,030 --> 01:52:24,490
he just talks about like we've had a 
coo.

2485
01:52:24,520 --> 01:52:28,570
We've been taken over by Russia.
Russia has taken over the United States.

2486
01:52:28,890 --> 01:52:31,500
It's been a bloodless group and he does,
uh,

2487
01:52:31,510 --> 01:52:32,860
that show,
the resistance,

2488
01:52:33,350 --> 01:52:36,700
you know,
he's going super hard left.

2489
01:52:36,770 --> 01:52:37,970
Yeah,
he's,

2490
01:52:38,270 --> 01:52:39,103
yeah,
it's some loopy stuff like watching him 

2491
01:52:41,270 --> 01:52:43,450
for nine minutes the other day,
just random.

2492
01:52:44,020 --> 01:52:46,100
Seems like he's in like some sort of 
like

2493
01:52:46,460 --> 01:52:50,300
one of those cable access studios and he
has to keep going,

2494
01:52:50,330 --> 01:52:54,110
like it doesn't go to commercial and 
another thing.

2495
01:52:54,280 --> 01:52:57,140
well that's what he's always done.
He's always been a great ranter.

2496
01:52:57,320 --> 01:52:58,153
He was one of the original espn sports 
center guys and he was a fucking beast 

2497
01:53:02,661 --> 01:53:03,830
man.
They what happened?

2498
01:53:03,890 --> 01:53:07,070
Why did they take him off espn?
Because that's where everybody loved him

2499
01:53:07,700 --> 01:53:10,010
and then he went from there and started 
doing political news.

2500
01:53:10,011 --> 01:53:10,844
So good.
It's almost like once you start doing 

2501
01:53:12,910 --> 01:53:14,660
keith olbermann right,
you got in trouble.

2502
01:53:14,750 --> 01:53:16,700
What do you do?
Some shit that he shouldn't have said he

2503
01:53:16,701 --> 01:53:17,534
kept going against the like,
I think it was mostly mostly it's like 

2504
01:53:19,221 --> 01:53:20,950
disney or the man because disney owns.
Yes,

2505
01:53:20,980 --> 01:53:24,230
but fucking man,
he got like him and dan patrick there.

2506
01:53:24,231 --> 01:53:25,064
I think they were both band from espn,
like facilities and not talk to anybody 

2507
01:53:29,690 --> 01:53:31,190
for 10 years.

2508
01:53:31,620 --> 01:53:32,453
And dan patrick recently,
I got back in good graces a little bit 

2509
01:53:34,881 --> 01:53:35,714
and they'll,
or maybe it was older men did and dan 

2510
01:53:36,441 --> 01:53:39,110
patrick is still completely like,
you're not,

2511
01:53:39,111 --> 01:53:39,944
don't talk to dan.
Patrick is what they kind of have to 

2512
01:53:41,151 --> 01:53:42,620
like.
It's like a big no,

2513
01:53:42,640 --> 01:53:45,080
no.
What did they get in trouble about?

2514
01:53:45,110 --> 01:53:47,420
I'll look it up second.
Wow.

2515
01:53:48,100 --> 01:53:48,933
But,
so then I didn't follow him and I 

2516
01:53:50,541 --> 01:53:52,460
didn't,
I don't follow sports so I didn't know,

2517
01:53:52,500 --> 01:53:53,333
you know,
I didn't know that he was like this big 

2518
01:53:54,321 --> 01:53:55,880
sports guy,
but I had heard people talk about it and

2519
01:53:55,881 --> 01:53:56,714
they really liked him and then I 
remember he went over and started doing 

2520
01:53:58,791 --> 01:53:59,624
political stuff and then there was a lot
of controversy and I feel like some of 

2521
01:54:03,621 --> 01:54:06,980
the controversy was like if you start 
out doing sports,

2522
01:54:07,100 --> 01:54:09,140
you got to stick with sports 
motherfucker.

2523
01:54:09,290 --> 01:54:10,123
Like people don't like you starting out 
with sports and then all of a sudden 

2524
01:54:12,681 --> 01:54:15,200
you're talking about politics.
Like what?

2525
01:54:15,560 --> 01:54:17,930
What are you running a political shit,
what the fuck?

2526
01:54:18,020 --> 01:54:19,670
Baseball,
exactly.

2527
01:54:20,330 --> 01:54:22,360
What about Willie Mays?
Right?

2528
01:54:22,400 --> 01:54:24,020
Babe ruth?
Come on.

2529
01:54:24,150 --> 01:54:26,060
Keith baseball.

2530
01:54:26,390 --> 01:54:27,900
Yeah.
That's what everybody,

2531
01:54:27,990 --> 01:54:28,770
you know.
Right?

2532
01:54:28,770 --> 01:54:29,603
What happened as you get your respect 
for that and we're supposed to like 

2533
01:54:31,920 --> 01:54:35,670
listen to your opinion on ranting 
political stuff.

2534
01:54:35,710 --> 01:54:38,580
Spend sports and politics go hand in 
hand it two things.

2535
01:54:38,581 --> 01:54:40,860
I can't stand,
you know for the most part.

2536
01:54:41,280 --> 01:54:44,970
But you care about this trump thing I 
did just because I have to hear about it

2537
01:54:45,000 --> 01:54:47,760
nonstop every single day.
Every single thing.

2538
01:54:47,761 --> 01:54:48,594
I like internet,
tv people and all are talking about 

2539
01:54:52,651 --> 01:54:54,990
trump.
It's like a nightmare that won't stop.

2540
01:54:55,340 --> 01:54:56,173
Like I don't give a shit about politics 
but I have to talk about trump and hear 

2541
01:54:59,761 --> 01:55:00,550
about trump.

2542
01:55:00,550 --> 01:55:02,060
But you do give a shit about trump 
though.

2543
01:55:02,061 --> 01:55:05,530
It's not just you hear about them.
You were just saying I give a shit.

2544
01:55:06,100 --> 01:55:06,701
Yeah,
I,

2545
01:55:06,701 --> 01:55:07,534
it's embarrassing,
but I'm like I wish I could just stop 

2546
01:55:09,461 --> 01:55:11,030
hearing about it now.
Like it's nothing.

2547
01:55:11,410 --> 01:55:13,300
I think people are tired of people 
complaining about it,

2548
01:55:13,301 --> 01:55:15,730
which is fascinating to me.
So what do you want them to do?

2549
01:55:16,270 --> 01:55:19,170
Like I'm just tired of people fucking 
complaining about a god damn it.

2550
01:55:19,180 --> 01:55:20,370
So I get up,
he won,

2551
01:55:20,470 --> 01:55:22,120
so I get up.
He's our president.

2552
01:55:22,121 --> 01:55:22,954
Like,
okay,

2553
01:55:23,020 --> 01:55:25,510
do you really expect the people are just
going to stop complaining because that's

2554
01:55:25,511 --> 01:55:27,040
ridiculous.
People always complain.

2555
01:55:27,490 --> 01:55:29,380
People complain,
no matter who the fuck wins.

2556
01:55:29,530 --> 01:55:33,790
If hillary clinton had won right now,
people would be going crazy on fox news.

2557
01:55:34,000 --> 01:55:37,960
they would be screaming for her head.
we can only hope that someone,

2558
01:55:38,140 --> 01:55:38,973
someone has the courage to prosecute 
this criminal for deleting those emails 

2559
01:55:43,050 --> 01:55:44,490
and they would just go crazy

2560
01:55:44,490 --> 01:55:45,323
about it.
But the difference is republicans would 

2561
01:55:46,711 --> 01:55:47,544
not have walked in the street unless she
had a grand by the deq video that they 

2562
01:55:50,891 --> 01:55:51,724
pulled out of nowhere.
And even then people would think it was 

2563
01:55:53,701 --> 01:55:55,410
funny.
Women would it be out there,

2564
01:55:55,560 --> 01:55:56,393
grab his deck,
grab his deck and let's throw this out 

2565
01:55:59,341 --> 01:56:00,091
there.
Yeah.

2566
01:56:00,091 --> 01:56:01,770
Okay.
So first of all,

2567
01:56:01,771 --> 01:56:03,720
the whole trump thing.
Grab them by the pussy.

2568
01:56:03,810 --> 01:56:08,810
He's talking about if you have a ton of 
money to to some guy being famous.

2569
01:56:09,690 --> 01:56:11,340
Very specifically,
is that what it was?

2570
01:56:11,370 --> 01:56:12,960
He's like,
you're a celebrity.

2571
01:56:12,961 --> 01:56:14,120
You can just grab them by the pussy.
Yeah,

2572
01:56:14,280 --> 01:56:16,290
they let you.
But he was saying they let you.

2573
01:56:16,510 --> 01:56:18,240
He was talking about like crazy 
groupies.

2574
01:56:18,270 --> 01:56:20,340
But here's the thing.
People are like,

2575
01:56:20,370 --> 01:56:22,110
oh,
that's unfit to be president,

2576
01:56:22,111 --> 01:56:24,480
but what our last.
I mean,

2577
01:56:24,720 --> 01:56:29,170
our last great president got his dick 
sucked in office in the,

2578
01:56:29,250 --> 01:56:31,440
in the oval office by an intern.

2579
01:56:31,470 --> 01:56:34,770
Then he lied about it to everybody,
including everyone.

2580
01:56:34,920 --> 01:56:39,240
I did not have sexual relationship.
Economy was bumping.

2581
01:56:39,241 --> 01:56:42,210
Gas prices were seventy two cents and 
nobody gave a fuck,

2582
01:56:42,211 --> 01:56:43,830
but now all of a sudden it's like,
wait,

2583
01:56:43,831 --> 01:56:47,190
this guy is demonizing women.
It's like,

2584
01:56:47,191 --> 01:56:47,761
oh,
okay.

2585
01:56:47,761 --> 01:56:50,910
Well he just got caught and it's one of 
the things that he said.

2586
01:56:50,911 --> 01:56:52,530
He's like,
I told clinton say,

2587
01:56:52,531 --> 01:56:53,640
well,
worse things.

2588
01:56:53,700 --> 01:56:54,550
Yeah.
Bill clinton,

2589
01:56:54,560 --> 01:56:56,130
the golf stuff.
Bill clinton,

2590
01:56:56,460 --> 01:56:59,880
bill clinton got his dick sucked while 
being the president.

2591
01:56:59,940 --> 01:57:00,773
We're talking about a recording on 
commercial break of what insight 

2592
01:57:03,571 --> 01:57:05,310
edition?
Ninety two.

2593
01:57:05,880 --> 01:57:08,970
I mean,
the comparisons are insane,

2594
01:57:09,000 --> 01:57:09,940
but bill,
bill clinton's,

2595
01:57:09,941 --> 01:57:10,774
uh,
seen any one's got freakishly great 

2596
01:57:12,001 --> 01:57:12,834
president.
There's a difference between hearing 

2597
01:57:14,041 --> 01:57:17,310
someone say something and knowing they 
did something to people.

2598
01:57:17,311 --> 01:57:20,070
There's a difference like knowing 
someone did something,

2599
01:57:20,071 --> 01:57:20,611
it's like,
wow,

2600
01:57:20,611 --> 01:57:21,850
I don't see it.
I hear it.

2601
01:57:21,890 --> 01:57:22,723
I know.
So if the audio of bill clinton getting 

2602
01:57:24,511 --> 01:57:25,980
his dick suck came out.
Oh yeah.

2603
01:57:26,000 --> 01:57:28,990
It was like,
you won't that into her and ron,

2604
01:57:29,760 --> 01:57:32,250
let me shoot on your dress.
Jamie,

2605
01:57:32,251 --> 01:57:33,084
what were you gonna say

2606
01:57:33,400 --> 01:57:37,570
was olbermann that was actually banned 
from espn to main campus.

2607
01:57:37,930 --> 01:57:38,763
That's why when he came back he was 
doing a show from New York in times 

2608
01:57:40,961 --> 01:57:43,810
square for my canadian abc,
like sub studio.

2609
01:57:44,310 --> 01:57:46,570
He just had lots of running and starting
in 1997,

2610
01:57:46,571 --> 01:57:50,230
he went on a daily show when it was 
still hosted by craig kilborn,

2611
01:57:50,260 --> 01:57:52,330
who was a former espn co-anchor with 
them.

2612
01:57:52,780 --> 01:57:54,060
That was like his first problem.
He,

2613
01:57:54,160 --> 01:57:54,993
he,
uh,

2614
01:57:55,180 --> 01:57:58,480
he called espn main campus at 
godforsaken place.

2615
01:57:59,940 --> 01:58:00,773
Got into an argument for saying that,
just lots of different things that 

2616
01:58:04,301 --> 01:58:06,490
happened over like 10 year period.
And then he came back,

2617
01:58:06,491 --> 01:58:08,170
like I said,
he had a little stint with them.

2618
01:58:08,171 --> 01:58:11,050
He got in trouble again for sanction 
against penn state supporters.

2619
01:58:11,470 --> 01:58:13,350
They suspended him for a little bit for 
that.

2620
01:58:13,710 --> 01:58:16,480
Penn state support is after the sandusky
trial.

2621
01:58:17,320 --> 01:58:18,153
What was,
what was so upsetting about tiredly 

2622
01:58:19,811 --> 01:58:21,520
also?
That stuff is kind of all been forgotten

2623
01:58:21,521 --> 01:58:23,050
now.
None of the,

2624
01:58:23,120 --> 01:58:23,953
the,
all of their punishments of just kinda 

2625
01:58:25,300 --> 01:58:26,320
all disappeared.
They don't,

2626
01:58:26,321 --> 01:58:27,154
they're not punished anymore.
They're back in the top of the college 

2627
01:58:29,141 --> 01:58:32,080
football rankings and everything for 
penn state.

2628
01:58:32,081 --> 01:58:32,850
Yeah.
Really?

2629
01:58:32,850 --> 01:58:33,650
Yeah.

2630
01:58:33,650 --> 01:58:36,510
Coming down here again,
we've got to get one of the um,

2631
01:58:36,710 --> 01:58:38,810
comedy store.
People to block the door.

2632
01:58:41,020 --> 01:58:42,130
They found that they can get down

2633
01:58:42,130 --> 01:58:45,550
here where they just leave the door open
and then there's a stairway where people

2634
01:58:45,551 --> 01:58:46,780
could just fall.
Sure.

2635
01:58:46,810 --> 01:58:47,643
They're supposed to be a security guy up
there and that's supposed to let them 

2636
01:58:49,901 --> 01:58:52,050
down there and she just shut the door.
Well,

2637
01:58:52,090 --> 01:58:52,923
people found out we're down here now.
That's the problem because I opened my 

2638
01:58:55,271 --> 01:58:57,340
big mouth because we're telling him 
about it.

2639
01:58:57,370 --> 01:58:59,770
He called it the underground.
At the comedy store.

2640
01:59:00,490 --> 01:59:01,323
Yeah.
But there's people that work here that 

2641
01:59:02,001 --> 01:59:04,870
are supposed to be down here and they 
haven't been doing it.

2642
01:59:05,180 --> 01:59:06,013
This,
this is the loosest like as like the 

2643
01:59:08,171 --> 01:59:11,560
people that work here,
they're all comics for all fuck off's.

2644
01:59:11,860 --> 01:59:12,693
Everybody like half is everything.
It comes to like letting people in to 

2645
01:59:16,300 --> 01:59:17,770
anything.
It's hilarious.

2646
01:59:18,010 --> 01:59:20,050
It's better.
What's half of the fun of this place?

2647
01:59:21,970 --> 01:59:26,970
We're going to have to have someone 
watch the door from now on these fox to.

2648
01:59:28,300 --> 01:59:32,260
That was the producer guy already?
Oh no it wasn't.

2649
01:59:32,880 --> 01:59:36,450
He said it was him.
I saw another dude too.

2650
01:59:36,560 --> 01:59:37,890
All right.
Well yeah,

2651
01:59:38,020 --> 01:59:39,550
I told them to try to get someone to 
watch.

2652
01:59:41,320 --> 01:59:46,320
Either way we should do these live 
instead of like making it like this down

2653
01:59:47,231 --> 01:59:48,064
in here.
Maybe we should just move this shit to 

2654
01:59:49,781 --> 01:59:50,614
the belly room.
I love live podcasting more than 

2655
01:59:54,100 --> 01:59:56,830
anything.
Well the belly room is such a great spot

2656
01:59:56,831 --> 01:59:59,460
for it too.
And we've already done a bunch of killed

2657
01:59:59,490 --> 02:00:02,730
tony's up there.
I feel like maybe there's a problem with

2658
02:00:02,980 --> 02:00:05,050
people knowing that we're doing it down 
here.

2659
02:00:05,650 --> 02:00:07,810
You know where they want to see what new
africa killed tony.

2660
02:00:07,811 --> 02:00:08,644
They're like,
where were you guys doing that show was 

2661
02:00:10,160 --> 02:00:11,170
like,
you can't watch it.

2662
02:00:11,560 --> 02:00:12,393
So go home,
get a new lock or something for that 

2663
02:00:15,580 --> 02:00:16,420
door up there.
Well,

2664
02:00:16,421 --> 02:00:18,850
they just need to have someone that 
actually stays where they're supposed to

2665
02:00:18,851 --> 02:00:20,610
stay and not,
uh,

2666
02:00:20,650 --> 02:00:22,630
not let people down.
And also like,

2667
02:00:22,670 --> 02:00:23,503
that's crazy staircase.
There's all sorts of equipment down 

2668
02:00:25,421 --> 02:00:27,850
here.
This is totally like behind the scenes.

2669
02:00:27,970 --> 02:00:30,010
there's all that equipment at the comedy
store owns.

2670
02:00:30,011 --> 02:00:30,844
It's all out there sitting out there.
You can't just be wandering around with 

2671
02:00:33,380 --> 02:00:35,620
that bitch,
but people are weird,

2672
02:00:35,621 --> 02:00:37,810
man.
They just want to be behind the scenes.

2673
02:00:37,811 --> 02:00:38,644
They want to get to that back bar.
They want to go behind the bar that 

2674
02:00:41,260 --> 02:00:42,093
people want.
I always want to go to that one place 

2675
02:00:42,851 --> 02:00:43,590
where you not supposed to.

2676
02:00:43,590 --> 02:00:45,770
And that's what's crazy is like when I 
got here,

2677
02:00:45,980 --> 02:00:48,470
I was mr.
Like I,

2678
02:00:48,700 --> 02:00:52,400
you had to invite me.
I've always treated this building with a

2679
02:00:52,401 --> 02:00:56,520
ridiculous amount of respect.
Like I never wanted any.

2680
02:00:57,190 --> 02:00:58,550
Fuck.
Now I'm talking about that.

2681
02:00:58,551 --> 02:01:01,730
It goes that it,
there's a statement that that is a thing

2682
02:01:01,731 --> 02:01:03,440
in which like,
and I've seen it,

2683
02:01:03,560 --> 02:01:04,393
those people that push themselves into 
that back alley that are always trying 

2684
02:01:06,561 --> 02:01:07,394
to smoke pot with everybody,
they're never the ones that end up a 

2685
02:01:10,820 --> 02:01:11,653
fucking doing anything.
They're always the ones in which it's 

2686
02:01:13,581 --> 02:01:15,920
like a found out about having to move 
back home.

2687
02:01:15,921 --> 02:01:17,630
My mom sick so I got to go to

2688
02:01:18,400 --> 02:01:21,820
worst when someone like,
chimes in on a conversation and just all

2689
02:01:21,821 --> 02:01:24,010
of a sudden talking about themselves.
Yeah.

2690
02:01:24,190 --> 02:01:26,140
But yeah,
exactly.

2691
02:01:26,320 --> 02:01:27,490
Or you get a lot of that back there.

2692
02:01:27,780 --> 02:01:30,510
It's the worst and they're losers,
you know what I mean?

2693
02:01:30,511 --> 02:01:32,490
But my point is,
is like the people that,

2694
02:01:32,700 --> 02:01:33,533
you know,
go with where they're invited and with 

2695
02:01:35,581 --> 02:01:37,320
people that they're friends with,
you know,

2696
02:01:37,321 --> 02:01:41,230
it's different.
There's just a different thing.

2697
02:01:41,260 --> 02:01:42,290
No,
it definitely is.

2698
02:01:42,350 --> 02:01:44,570
People want to race to the back,
to the,

2699
02:01:44,780 --> 02:01:45,613
to the green room in the back to smoke 
because they think there's a shortcut 

2700
02:01:48,141 --> 02:01:48,974
waiting for them there and is a not.
You still have to meet a shortcut to 

2701
02:01:52,671 --> 02:01:54,110
make it as a comic.
Yeah.

2702
02:01:54,111 --> 02:01:54,980
But I guess,
but I,

2703
02:01:54,990 --> 02:01:57,770
but I think this analogy applies 
probably for any job,

2704
02:01:57,890 --> 02:02:01,130
you know what I mean is it's like it's 
not just about the hang,

2705
02:02:01,280 --> 02:02:02,113
it's about,
you've always had this combination of 

2706
02:02:03,231 --> 02:02:03,840
the two.

2707
02:02:03,840 --> 02:02:07,290
You've always had this like disdain for 
people who network.

2708
02:02:07,670 --> 02:02:09,620
Yeah.
Yeah.

2709
02:02:09,910 --> 02:02:10,743
Because I think there's a way to do it 
and I think it happens organically and 

2710
02:02:12,841 --> 02:02:16,920
naturally and in people that overdo it,
it's just gross.

2711
02:02:17,130 --> 02:02:19,350
The people that overdo it or almost 
always not that funny.

2712
02:02:19,680 --> 02:02:21,420
Yeah.
And I do it a lot,

2713
02:02:21,421 --> 02:02:24,270
but I do it my own way,
you know what I mean?

2714
02:02:24,960 --> 02:02:27,300
Does that make sense?
Like I'm not a networker,

2715
02:02:27,360 --> 02:02:32,360
but I hang out and I do three podcasts a
week and fucking stand up all the time.

2716
02:02:33,250 --> 02:02:35,080
It's different.
There's one thing that's Like,

2717
02:02:35,110 --> 02:02:37,810
you're not consciously trying to 
network.

2718
02:02:37,840 --> 02:02:40,660
You're working with your peers and your 
friends.

2719
02:02:40,661 --> 02:02:41,320
Yeah.
That's.

2720
02:02:41,320 --> 02:02:41,931
Yeah.
There's,

2721
02:02:41,931 --> 02:02:42,850
there's that network.

2722
02:02:43,400 --> 02:02:45,620
I think there's a natural amount of 
networking that happens.

2723
02:02:45,630 --> 02:02:47,640
Watch house of cards.
It's my favorite thing.

2724
02:02:47,641 --> 02:02:49,410
I'm the one that.
Do you watch it now?

2725
02:02:49,480 --> 02:02:51,150
Yes.
Tell me about.

2726
02:02:51,151 --> 02:02:51,984
A lot of people told me about this,
don't try to claim you told me about 

2727
02:02:53,351 --> 02:02:54,184
this.
I'm sure a lot of people did because 

2728
02:02:54,841 --> 02:02:58,470
it's like one of only four.
Let's go back to the show.

2729
02:02:58,590 --> 02:02:59,423
Yeah,

2730
02:03:01,140 --> 02:03:01,973
it's a fucking hilarious show.
When you realize like this is probably 

2731
02:03:05,071 --> 02:03:08,940
how it really works and that networking,
like that kind of shit like that.

2732
02:03:09,000 --> 02:03:11,850
That kind of networking is what we're 
scared of in comedy.

2733
02:03:12,120 --> 02:03:13,980
Like that's how the entire business 
runs.

2734
02:03:14,010 --> 02:03:16,740
That's how the white house runs.
That's how politics runs.

2735
02:03:17,100 --> 02:03:17,933
That's why you're scared of it because 
you're scared of that kind of shit 

2736
02:03:20,400 --> 02:03:23,130
getting into here where it's all about 
favors and bullshit,

2737
02:03:23,150 --> 02:03:25,060
right?
Yeah.

2738
02:03:25,061 --> 02:03:27,730
This place has a loophole for not having
that crap.

2739
02:03:28,020 --> 02:03:28,940
It used to be,
dude.

2740
02:03:29,910 --> 02:03:31,470
It used to be.
That's how you got gigs.

2741
02:03:31,500 --> 02:03:32,490
It used to be the.
There was a.

2742
02:03:32,491 --> 02:03:34,680
There was a big problem in hollywood for
a long time.

2743
02:03:34,700 --> 02:03:36,690
It was like that's how people got on 
shows.

2744
02:03:36,930 --> 02:03:37,763
That's how they were writers.
Like there was a lot of fucking really 

2745
02:03:40,531 --> 02:03:43,800
bad writers back in the day that we're 
on sitcoms.

2746
02:03:44,010 --> 02:03:44,970
Like you would think,
hey man,

2747
02:03:44,971 --> 02:03:48,330
you get to be a writer on like a friend 
or a seinfeld or something like that.

2748
02:03:48,550 --> 02:03:51,180
You've got to be a really funny person.
And

2749
02:03:51,860 --> 02:03:54,800
by the way,
that's totally still a thing in writer's

2750
02:03:54,801 --> 02:03:55,700
rooms.
Oh yeah.

2751
02:03:55,760 --> 02:03:59,390
Tell me about that.
I mean there's,

2752
02:03:59,420 --> 02:04:02,210
you know,
a guy or two that I've worked with,

2753
02:04:02,240 --> 02:04:04,850
you know,
in the small,

2754
02:04:04,910 --> 02:04:08,330
you know,
roast writer's world that I've worked in

2755
02:04:08,331 --> 02:04:09,800
that are literally,
you know,

2756
02:04:10,010 --> 02:04:10,843
they're pulling a huge favor man.
Like maybe the people feel bad for this 

2757
02:04:15,021 --> 02:04:16,520
guy,
you know what I mean,

2758
02:04:16,521 --> 02:04:17,870
or whatever.
But you know,

2759
02:04:17,871 --> 02:04:20,760
he's lazy and doesn't do much and you 
know,

2760
02:04:20,770 --> 02:04:21,603
sort of just gets to like phone and in 
while everybody else is sort of like 

2761
02:04:23,931 --> 02:04:26,630
writing the actual thing probably gets 
nothing in.

2762
02:04:26,660 --> 02:04:28,280
You know what I mean?
It's a part of,

2763
02:04:28,940 --> 02:04:32,660
part of a.
I think it's a part of that entire crazy

2764
02:04:32,661 --> 02:04:35,570
world is there's always like a favor 
always.

2765
02:04:36,700 --> 02:04:38,400
There's always that.
They have these teams.

2766
02:04:38,860 --> 02:04:39,693
A lot of times comedy teams are like 
writer teams are one really funny guy 

2767
02:04:42,960 --> 02:04:44,580
and the other guy who writes the funny 
shit down,

2768
02:04:45,780 --> 02:04:48,270
totally got the funny guy,
wanders around the office,

2769
02:04:48,330 --> 02:04:51,270
scratches his beard and the other guy's 
writing shit down.

2770
02:04:51,320 --> 02:04:55,640
Even if you watch six days to air,
like it's so fucking,

2771
02:04:55,641 --> 02:04:56,930
you know,
matt and trey,

2772
02:04:56,931 --> 02:04:59,270
period.
While those other people are,

2773
02:04:59,840 --> 02:05:01,640
you know,
writers,

2774
02:05:01,641 --> 02:05:05,270
but you barely tagging anything,
you can totally see the vision.

2775
02:05:05,271 --> 02:05:08,630
Just puking,
puking it out of his head,

2776
02:05:08,631 --> 02:05:11,570
laughing.
They're both laughing and adding to each

2777
02:05:11,571 --> 02:05:12,404
other's thing.
Then there's these other people that 

2778
02:05:14,140 --> 02:05:14,973
know.
People are like,

2779
02:05:15,050 --> 02:05:15,883
they're just.
I mean that you need them to in that 

2780
02:05:18,470 --> 02:05:19,303
environment I think.
I think you need like the occasional 

2781
02:05:21,740 --> 02:05:23,540
dusting and sprinkling.
Totally,

2782
02:05:23,570 --> 02:05:25,890
but that's a different situation because
you've got a super genius.

2783
02:05:25,891 --> 02:05:26,724
Yeah.
That trey parker dudes a super genius 

2784
02:05:29,950 --> 02:05:32,840
and so that's.
That's one thing,

2785
02:05:32,841 --> 02:05:36,290
but like those sitcoms,
when you're working on a sitcom,

2786
02:05:36,291 --> 02:05:39,530
that's when it becomes really,
really apparent and it's also one of the

2787
02:05:39,531 --> 02:05:44,120
weird things about comedy writers is 
some comedy writers or standup comics,

2788
02:05:44,121 --> 02:05:48,290
but most of them are not so like were 
they practicing all this comedy?

2789
02:05:48,680 --> 02:05:51,200
Like what are you do?
You don't perform it,

2790
02:05:51,201 --> 02:05:53,270
but you know what's funny?
You sure?

2791
02:05:53,720 --> 02:05:55,400
Are you sure?
Are you sure?

2792
02:05:55,500 --> 02:05:56,333
It was funny because I write a lot of 
things down that I think is going to be 

2793
02:05:57,621 --> 02:06:00,710
funny and then not really funny like how
do you practice?

2794
02:06:01,220 --> 02:06:04,010
You don't you get taken by people like 
me.

2795
02:06:04,011 --> 02:06:08,300
They get added to the writer's room and 
you get fucking house and it makes these

2796
02:06:08,301 --> 02:06:10,190
people have to.
What do you mean you get taken?

2797
02:06:10,820 --> 02:06:11,653
I come in and all of a sudden I'm 
writing the jokes that are making it to 

2798
02:06:14,901 --> 02:06:17,630
the actual episode.
For example,

2799
02:06:18,860 --> 02:06:22,040
like let's got to be some funny people 
you're working with to totally,

2800
02:06:22,250 --> 02:06:23,400
totally,
but they're.

2801
02:06:23,540 --> 02:06:25,760
Those people.
Normally by the way,

2802
02:06:25,820 --> 02:06:29,210
are standup comedians as well.
There's a few gurus,

2803
02:06:29,660 --> 02:06:30,530
but occasionally

2804
02:06:30,560 --> 02:06:34,160
people have ideas that are not.
They're not performers that had just,

2805
02:06:34,220 --> 02:06:37,040
they just write,
just are comedy writers and you just go,

2806
02:06:37,041 --> 02:06:38,750
what is going on with this?

2807
02:06:39,580 --> 02:06:41,650
Yeah.
Some people were continuously.

2808
02:06:42,160 --> 02:06:46,360
Some people are bs.
It's a very interesting business.

2809
02:06:47,030 --> 02:06:47,863
Yeah,
but there's a couple of people that get 

2810
02:06:48,971 --> 02:06:50,720
by on.
I don't know how I.

2811
02:06:50,960 --> 02:06:51,793
It shocks me sometimes when I see a 
certain couple people in another 

2812
02:06:54,971 --> 02:06:57,420
writer's room making writer's guild 
medicine

2813
02:06:57,870 --> 02:07:01,010
loan is a fascinating enterprise.
You know,

2814
02:07:01,070 --> 02:07:01,903
making things up,
sitting down in front of a computer and 

2815
02:07:03,981 --> 02:07:06,830
making up scenarios,
making people,

2816
02:07:06,980 --> 02:07:10,250
making up stories,
making a plot,

2817
02:07:10,670 --> 02:07:15,650
making the twists in the plot and 
characters and it's fucking crazy way to

2818
02:07:15,651 --> 02:07:16,420
make a living.
It

2819
02:07:16,420 --> 02:07:17,253
is weird.
It's like use your mind to formulate a 

2820
02:07:20,651 --> 02:07:22,090
world,
you know,

2821
02:07:22,240 --> 02:07:24,880
it's continuously asking yourself 
questions.

2822
02:07:24,910 --> 02:07:28,150
You're like writing a trivia game and 
answering it at the same time.

2823
02:07:28,240 --> 02:07:29,890
Who's the character?
What would he do?

2824
02:07:29,920 --> 02:07:32,200
What is that?
What would it smell like?

2825
02:07:32,201 --> 02:07:33,820
What is this?
What would he say?

2826
02:07:34,090 --> 02:07:36,060
That's why comedy teams totally makes

2827
02:07:36,060 --> 02:07:36,893
sense,
but I've met the comedy guy from the 

2828
02:07:39,371 --> 02:07:40,204
comedy team after they broke uP,
like the one that got tired of the guy 

2829
02:07:43,601 --> 02:07:46,150
who's not funny and said,
what the fuck am I doing with this guy?

2830
02:07:46,360 --> 02:07:48,430
He got tired of just reading things to 
the guy and the other guy.

2831
02:07:49,480 --> 02:07:52,210
I've met that guY too.
Those guys are brutal.

2832
02:07:52,420 --> 02:07:53,350
And you'll go,
oh,

2833
02:07:53,351 --> 02:07:55,240
you were a part of a team.
huh?

2834
02:07:55,840 --> 02:07:58,290
I met two guys like that or whatever.
That.

2835
02:07:59,170 --> 02:08:00,820
What?
That one those to attend?

2836
02:08:00,870 --> 02:08:01,241
No,
no,

2837
02:08:01,241 --> 02:08:02,590
not comedians.
I'm not talking about.

2838
02:08:02,591 --> 02:08:04,940
Stand up.
No,

2839
02:08:04,980 --> 02:08:06,220
no,
that's italian.

2840
02:08:06,280 --> 02:08:07,780
No,
I'm talking about writers.

2841
02:08:08,650 --> 02:08:10,720
Yeah,
there's a zone.

2842
02:08:10,960 --> 02:08:12,910
I've met a bunch of those guys.
Like when I,

2843
02:08:12,960 --> 02:08:16,090
I had a development deal long time ago 
with this guy that uh,

2844
02:08:16,120 --> 02:08:16,953
he used to be a writer on friends and 
this dude had like bowling shoes on and 

2845
02:08:21,850 --> 02:08:23,200
he was part of a comedy team.

2846
02:08:23,200 --> 02:08:26,470
The team broke up and uh,
I met with a guy and I was like,

2847
02:08:26,471 --> 02:08:28,450
he's wearing bowling shoes,
like,

2848
02:08:28,480 --> 02:08:29,860
you know,
trying to be like wacky,

2849
02:08:30,350 --> 02:08:32,590
like why is he wearing bowling shoes?
Those aren't comfortable,

2850
02:08:32,970 --> 02:08:33,803
nobody wants to wear a bowling shoes,
like he was wearing bowling shoes 

2851
02:08:36,521 --> 02:08:38,740
because like bowling shoes is like,
he's so wacky.

2852
02:08:38,890 --> 02:08:42,070
He wears bowling shoes around the office
and I was.

2853
02:08:42,090 --> 02:08:44,770
I was telling my manager so he's wearing
fucking bowling shoes.

2854
02:08:44,771 --> 02:08:46,550
I don't like it,
and he's like a serious go.

2855
02:08:46,560 --> 02:08:47,800
Yeah,
why is he wearing polling shows?

2856
02:08:47,950 --> 02:08:49,450
Like we had this conversation like,
why do you care?

2857
02:08:49,451 --> 02:08:50,261
I go,
I care.

2858
02:08:50,261 --> 02:08:52,390
Because it's like,
why would you do in that?

2859
02:08:52,391 --> 02:08:55,540
Because you want to be whack was you 
have exploding tie like you gotta look,

2860
02:08:55,720 --> 02:08:58,890
check out my carnation plot squirts you 
like,

2861
02:08:59,170 --> 02:09:01,570
what is this guy?
What does he think is actually funny?

2862
02:09:02,110 --> 02:09:06,490
He gave us a script and it was the worst
piece of shit I've ever read.

2863
02:09:06,820 --> 02:09:08,650
It was so bad.
It was so bad.

2864
02:09:08,651 --> 02:09:09,484
It was stunning.
It was so bad that the network who 

2865
02:09:10,601 --> 02:09:11,434
recommended him and theY gave him a 
gigantic development deal after he left 

2866
02:09:14,201 --> 02:09:15,034
this,
a sitcom might've left friends and went 

2867
02:09:17,110 --> 02:09:18,250
to another one.
I forget what it was,

2868
02:09:18,670 --> 02:09:21,910
but they gave this cat a gigantic 
network deal,

2869
02:09:22,000 --> 02:09:22,833
like a huge development deal.
And this was the first thing that he 

2870
02:09:25,001 --> 02:09:27,370
delivered off this huge deal and 
everybody was like,

2871
02:09:27,400 --> 02:09:28,233
oh no.
And that's when the concept of the 

2872
02:09:31,061 --> 02:09:33,820
comedy team became apparent to me what 
others.

2873
02:09:33,910 --> 02:09:37,330
Two of them are the funny one and left 
this guy behind and he's like,

2874
02:09:37,331 --> 02:09:38,980
fuck this guy.
And they're like,

2875
02:09:38,981 --> 02:09:39,251
no,
no.

2876
02:09:39,251 --> 02:09:41,110
He's very funny too.
And most importantly,

2877
02:09:41,111 --> 02:09:43,890
you understand story structure.
I got an a.

2878
02:09:44,110 --> 02:09:45,160
he's not funny.
I go,

2879
02:09:45,161 --> 02:09:46,510
this is definitely not funny.
Well,

2880
02:09:46,511 --> 02:09:47,344
you know,
this is a first draft and you have to 

2881
02:09:48,160 --> 02:09:49,690
like,
nope,

2882
02:09:49,990 --> 02:09:52,840
this is a terrible concept.
Like the concept was awful.

2883
02:09:52,960 --> 02:09:55,930
It was about a guy who time travels and 
uh,

2884
02:09:56,290 --> 02:09:57,220
our,
he's immortal.

2885
02:09:57,550 --> 02:09:58,301
And he was,
yeah,

2886
02:09:58,301 --> 02:10:00,110
that's what it was.
He's a mortal and uh,

2887
02:10:00,111 --> 02:10:00,944
all he does is like get laid like what?
It's been around since ancient Egypt 

2888
02:10:07,180 --> 02:10:09,370
usually like cursed in ancient Egypt so 
he can never die.

2889
02:10:09,630 --> 02:10:10,463
And he just gets laid and the whole 
night or they're like looking at each 

2890
02:10:12,551 --> 02:10:12,971
other,
like,

2891
02:10:12,971 --> 02:10:14,470
what in the fuck?
I go,

2892
02:10:15,020 --> 02:10:15,853
yeah,
well the samei so good luck with all of 

2893
02:10:19,300 --> 02:10:22,630
fucking abandoned ship.
It was hilarious.

2894
02:10:23,280 --> 02:10:25,480
There's things like that.
They get pitched every day,

2895
02:10:25,690 --> 02:10:26,523
there's some guy who comes into an 
office and I've had some fucking 

2896
02:10:28,001 --> 02:10:28,834
terrible ideas myself.
I've had some terrible ideas that I 

2897
02:10:30,881 --> 02:10:33,590
thought were good.
Write them out like this is it,

2898
02:10:33,800 --> 02:10:35,430
and then you'll put it down for a couple
of weeks,

2899
02:10:35,470 --> 02:10:37,940
come back to it and you're like,
what the fuck was I thinking?

2900
02:10:38,320 --> 02:10:39,410
Like,
oh my god.

2901
02:10:40,380 --> 02:10:41,213
I mean,
what percentage of ideas that you start 

2902
02:10:42,301 --> 02:10:43,134
out with that you bring to the stage 
eventually wind up making it onto a 

2903
02:10:46,521 --> 02:10:49,220
special or making it into your act 
permanently?

2904
02:10:51,150 --> 02:10:52,840
Um,
is it even half?

2905
02:10:54,010 --> 02:10:56,170
Probably about.
Probably a little.

2906
02:10:56,350 --> 02:10:57,820
Probably about half.
Yeah,

2907
02:10:58,660 --> 02:11:03,040
I think so because I really don't try it
unless I really,

2908
02:11:03,250 --> 02:11:04,083
really think it's funny,
like in think that it fits with my tone 

2909
02:11:08,951 --> 02:11:09,784
and everything.
Rub you have the possibility of working 

2910
02:11:11,861 --> 02:11:13,950
those things out,
you know,

2911
02:11:13,960 --> 02:11:14,793
hammering them out on stage.
Like to really knock it out of the park 

2912
02:11:17,471 --> 02:11:20,970
with a comedy script and not ever 
practice.

2913
02:11:21,020 --> 02:11:24,550
Like that's one of the things that makes
south park so particularly special.

2914
02:11:25,090 --> 02:11:29,470
It's like they're not even practicing it
and turning it into like it's best form.

2915
02:11:29,770 --> 02:11:32,490
They're kind of coming at you with this 
idea.

2916
02:11:32,491 --> 02:11:35,100
Like the initial idea.
I mean they,

2917
02:11:35,101 --> 02:11:36,610
they've honed it,
they've cut it down,

2918
02:11:36,611 --> 02:11:38,560
they've edited it,
they've gone over it,

2919
02:11:38,561 --> 02:11:40,180
they've made it funnier,
I'm sure,

2920
02:11:40,660 --> 02:11:41,493
but like they don't get to do it for six
months in front of various crowds and 

2921
02:11:46,571 --> 02:11:50,840
watch it come to life.
You know,

2922
02:11:50,880 --> 02:11:52,370
if you think about guys like Stephen 
King,

2923
02:11:52,900 --> 02:11:56,780
all the shit that guy's made up Just 
sits around and makes things up.

2924
02:11:57,210 --> 02:11:58,043
Did you see his new show?
The 11 slash 29 about jfk assassination 

2925
02:12:01,621 --> 02:12:02,990
and time travel?
No,

2926
02:12:03,030 --> 02:12:03,920
I've even heard of it.
Oh,

2927
02:12:03,960 --> 02:12:08,160
it's great.
It's on netflix or hulu?

2928
02:12:08,220 --> 02:12:09,001
Hulu,
hulu.

2929
02:12:09,001 --> 02:12:11,100
James franco's like the star.
Oh,

2930
02:12:11,101 --> 02:12:12,820
what's it called again?
11 slash 29 slash 11.

2931
02:12:12,850 --> 02:12:15,660
Twenty three 63 I think the day he got 
shot.

2932
02:12:15,960 --> 02:12:16,900
Oh,
it's really good.

2933
02:12:17,720 --> 02:12:18,330
Shout.
Yeah,

2934
02:12:18,330 --> 02:12:19,200
it's,
it's fun.

2935
02:12:19,230 --> 02:12:19,951
It's uh,
it,

2936
02:12:19,951 --> 02:12:22,920
it does time travel.
Franco's great in it.

2937
02:12:23,570 --> 02:12:24,403
Do you want to stop and think about all 
the fucking amazing entertainment 

2938
02:12:28,131 --> 02:12:32,530
Stephen King has put out over the years?
That guy's insane.

2939
02:12:32,560 --> 02:12:37,560
Yeah,
I mean carry it salem's lot,

2940
02:12:38,690 --> 02:12:39,523
christine.
I mean you can go on and on and on and 

2941
02:12:42,740 --> 02:12:47,300
on and on.
Pet cemetery maximum over at.

2942
02:12:47,390 --> 02:12:51,480
You guys made some sheer misery.
Oh,

2943
02:12:52,420 --> 02:12:56,840
and I'm helen bowser name kathy.
Kathy bates.

2944
02:12:56,841 --> 02:12:59,010
I was thinking of Helen Hunt because you
have,

2945
02:12:59,060 --> 02:13:02,630
you put her in my head earlier.
chicken up those twister balls.

2946
02:13:02,960 --> 02:13:07,640
Yeah man.
god damn that one guy is responsible for

2947
02:13:07,641 --> 02:13:11,540
so much iconic entertainment.
Silver bullet.

2948
02:13:11,870 --> 02:13:13,460
The kid in the wheelchair and the 
werewolf.

2949
02:13:15,220 --> 02:13:17,870
It's already too,
like it's been remade right now.

2950
02:13:17,900 --> 02:13:19,040
It's coming out this year.
Who is,

2951
02:13:19,070 --> 02:13:20,600
who's remaking it?
Uh,

2952
02:13:20,830 --> 02:13:21,663
I mean he's part of it.
He's going to talk right into the mike 

2953
02:13:25,010 --> 02:13:25,843
suk a bill's scars gotten.
I don't recognize anyone that's 

2954
02:13:28,671 --> 02:13:32,580
skarsgard skarsgard as scars go.
Oh wow.

2955
02:13:33,640 --> 02:13:37,560
Look like that guy who's putting the 
show together.

2956
02:13:38,520 --> 02:13:42,510
Is it a movie we had to make a movie?
But that's a book that's so long.

2957
02:13:42,511 --> 02:13:44,850
I've read that book.
It's a long book.

2958
02:13:45,000 --> 02:13:45,721
It.
Yeah.

2959
02:13:45,721 --> 02:13:48,160
that's why when they had it on 
television then they have multiple,

2960
02:13:48,161 --> 02:13:49,590
a,
of the mini series.

2961
02:13:49,710 --> 02:13:50,850
Yeah.
And there was,

2962
02:13:50,851 --> 02:13:52,800
um,
that comic,

2963
02:13:53,010 --> 02:13:56,250
not a clue.
Tim.

2964
02:13:56,480 --> 02:14:00,810
Tim wasn't that the guy from rocky 
horror picture show?

2965
02:14:02,170 --> 02:14:04,680
Curry curry.
He was the clown,

2966
02:14:04,710 --> 02:14:05,850
right?
Wasn't it?

2967
02:14:05,910 --> 02:14:06,990
Yep.
And do you know,

2968
02:14:07,050 --> 02:14:10,470
do you know tim curry is like in a 
wheelchair now and could barely talk and

2969
02:14:10,471 --> 02:14:12,530
he's like a,
he's like a vegetable.

2970
02:14:12,930 --> 02:14:15,270
What happened?
I think he had a stroke.

2971
02:14:15,650 --> 02:14:20,250
He had a really bad stroke.
no one really talks about that either.

2972
02:14:20,251 --> 02:14:22,560
You don't really know that.
Like I saw him in an interview and I was

2973
02:14:22,561 --> 02:14:24,360
like,
what the fuck happened to tim curry?

2974
02:14:24,480 --> 02:14:25,580
Oh,
that's a palmer.

2975
02:14:25,860 --> 02:14:26,693
I didn't know that.

2976
02:14:27,280 --> 02:14:28,113
You know,
richard dawkins had a stroke to the 

2977
02:14:29,991 --> 02:14:30,824
scientist.
The selfish mean you don't know that 

2978
02:14:34,800 --> 02:14:35,633
guys.
He's a pretty famous atheist and 

2979
02:14:38,630 --> 02:14:43,130
scientist and I'm author and he had a 
stroke,

2980
02:14:43,131 --> 02:14:46,880
but he recovered and it didn't affect 
his cognitive function,

2981
02:14:46,881 --> 02:14:49,190
but it did affect the way your hands 
moved.

2982
02:14:49,191 --> 02:14:52,280
He can't play the piano.
And it also affected.

2983
02:14:52,310 --> 02:14:56,300
He can't,
he can't sing anymore.

2984
02:14:56,330 --> 02:14:58,790
I can't pull it off.
Like he's,

2985
02:14:58,820 --> 02:15:00,980
he's diminished,
but he still speaks,

2986
02:15:01,160 --> 02:15:01,993
which is really interesting.
The part of his brain that was affected 

2987
02:15:05,331 --> 02:15:06,164
by the stroke,
it didn't fuck them up to the point 

2988
02:15:08,721 --> 02:15:09,554
where he,
he can't sing anymore or he can't talk 

2989
02:15:11,241 --> 02:15:12,074
anymore.
He talks Just as well as they always 

2990
02:15:13,131 --> 02:15:15,350
did.
Makes really lucid points.

2991
02:15:15,440 --> 02:15:16,430
Still very smart.

2992
02:15:16,690 --> 02:15:20,600
It's nuts how it's probably like a 
microscopic fraction of a difference,

2993
02:15:20,601 --> 02:15:23,060
like a stroke.
What it hits and what it doesn't hit.

2994
02:15:23,420 --> 02:15:24,490
You know what I mean?
Look,

2995
02:15:24,500 --> 02:15:28,130
could hit any portion of your brain,
but the portion that it hit on his brain

2996
02:15:28,160 --> 02:15:32,180
just affect motor skills apparently.
Fortunately for him.

2997
02:15:32,820 --> 02:15:34,430
But fuck man.
What a weird

2998
02:15:34,680 --> 02:15:39,180
feelIng to know that your bodies as kind
of like short circuiting that you blew a

2999
02:15:39,181 --> 02:15:40,560
fuse.
You know,

3000
02:15:41,790 --> 02:15:43,830
like I'd be a blue a circuit the other 
day,

3001
02:15:44,220 --> 02:15:46,110
you know,
where you plug something in,

3002
02:15:46,111 --> 02:15:47,460
it doesn't work.
Like what the fuck?

3003
02:15:47,730 --> 02:15:49,500
Then you go out to the circuit court,
oh god,

3004
02:15:49,560 --> 02:15:50,393
this fucking flip out for the flip that 
sucker over and then it starts working 

3005
02:15:53,161 --> 02:15:55,080
again and you gotta think,
man,

3006
02:15:55,380 --> 02:16:00,380
that's kinda like your brain's almost 
like a biological circuit board.

3007
02:16:01,300 --> 02:16:02,133
You know,
there's a bunch of electricity going 

3008
02:16:03,751 --> 02:16:04,584
through there,
bunch of neurons firing all these cells 

3009
02:16:06,571 --> 02:16:08,940
in there and every now and then one of 
them goes,

3010
02:16:13,080 --> 02:16:15,870
that can happen to you.
It's tim conway still alive.

3011
02:16:16,910 --> 02:16:19,800
It's a good question.
His son was a really good radio show.

3012
02:16:19,990 --> 02:16:24,990
Hosts conway and steckler tim conway,
alive and kIcking.

3013
02:16:25,860 --> 02:16:26,430
I love that.
Yeah.

3014
02:16:26,430 --> 02:16:27,263
Conway and steckler.
They used to have a really good radio 

3015
02:16:28,381 --> 02:16:30,160
show on fm talk station.

3016
02:16:30,370 --> 02:16:31,203
I think he's still doing some.
I heard him the other day on some tim 

3017
02:16:34,001 --> 02:16:36,220
conway junior.
Never hear about them.

3018
02:16:36,880 --> 02:16:38,740
He would have a great podcast.
That guy,

3019
02:16:38,980 --> 02:16:42,490
maybe he does.
He does typed in his name and it pops up

3020
02:16:43,590 --> 02:16:45,910
the tim conway.
I think it's that show.

3021
02:16:46,450 --> 02:16:48,160
Tim conway junior on demand.
It says.

3022
02:16:48,520 --> 02:16:50,350
I think it's just called his name.
Well,

3023
02:16:50,351 --> 02:16:51,380
there you go.
Yeah,

3024
02:16:51,580 --> 02:16:52,413
I did it.
Show a gang of times way back in the 

3025
02:16:54,340 --> 02:16:54,770
day.

3026
02:16:54,770 --> 02:16:58,040
Back when the talk radio was crazy.
They had a whole network.

3027
02:16:58,180 --> 02:16:59,013
good.

3028
02:16:59,360 --> 02:17:00,193
Oh,
radio station devoted to talk radio in 

3029
02:17:02,211 --> 02:17:03,380
la.
It was crazy

3030
02:17:04,090 --> 02:17:04,923
and I remember listening to it like they
went all talk is when I was on news 

3031
02:17:08,661 --> 02:17:10,100
radio,
I'd be driving to work.

3032
02:17:10,101 --> 02:17:11,000
I'm like,
this is great.

3033
02:17:11,240 --> 02:17:12,073
They just talk.
They would just have funny shit and 

3034
02:17:14,661 --> 02:17:17,610
occasionally and have a whack host.
They let a few whack ones in there.

3035
02:17:17,830 --> 02:17:21,020
Oh,
well these lessons am radio fm fm talk.

3036
02:17:21,200 --> 02:17:22,850
Wow.
Yeah.

3037
02:17:23,000 --> 02:17:24,470
Hey,
Still actually is is uh,

3038
02:17:24,530 --> 02:17:26,450
he's on the,
on the air here.

3039
02:17:26,640 --> 02:17:29,550
M,
s kfi am 6:45,

3040
02:17:29,670 --> 02:17:30,110
six,
seven,

3041
02:17:30,110 --> 02:17:30,943
10 week days and I tAke that.
Does the morning show on a protest at 

3042
02:17:33,351 --> 02:17:34,970
night?
Six to 10:00

3043
02:17:34,970 --> 02:17:35,451
PM.
Oh,

3044
02:17:35,451 --> 02:17:37,490
ten cents to take that.
Put it as a podcast.

3045
02:17:37,560 --> 02:17:40,610
Had a nighttime show back then to what 
happened to that steckler guys

3046
02:17:40,750 --> 02:17:41,583
still around

3047
02:17:43,850 --> 02:17:47,810
apple dumpling gang dumpling.
I didn't even know about that.

3048
02:17:47,840 --> 02:17:49,910
You always bring that up.
I don't know what that reference.

3049
02:17:49,940 --> 02:17:50,773
What does that reference to?
Tim conway and don knotts movie your 

3050
02:17:55,431 --> 02:17:57,380
daughters would love it?
Probably not.

3051
02:17:57,730 --> 02:18:01,550
It's yet one of my favorites.
Beetle juice.

3052
02:18:01,700 --> 02:18:02,770
That's,
that'd be a fun one.

3053
02:18:03,220 --> 02:18:04,053
they liked that a lot,
but you know what they thought it was 

3054
02:18:05,031 --> 02:18:06,920
fucking hilarious.
Talladega nights.

3055
02:18:07,980 --> 02:18:08,813
There were

3056
02:18:09,270 --> 02:18:11,530
all a little inappropriate,
inappropriate moments.

3057
02:18:11,740 --> 02:18:13,500
A few inappropriate things.
They say,

3058
02:18:13,501 --> 02:18:15,510
but god damn,
that fucking show is funny.

3059
02:18:15,511 --> 02:18:16,590
That movie rather was funny.

3060
02:18:16,640 --> 02:18:18,780
Did you show him molana or whatever?
Yeah,

3061
02:18:18,860 --> 02:18:20,630
they love that.
THat was amazing.

3062
02:18:20,810 --> 02:18:21,643
Star wars.

3063
02:18:21,870 --> 02:18:22,830
Yeah,
they seen star wars.

3064
02:18:22,860 --> 02:18:24,600
It's funny.
I watched the old star wars.

3065
02:18:25,000 --> 02:18:25,833
You watched the old star wars.
Then you watch the new star wars and 

3066
02:18:27,180 --> 02:18:30,990
like this special effects.
Some school project,

3067
02:18:31,440 --> 02:18:33,540
you know?
I mean it literally looks like something

3068
02:18:33,541 --> 02:18:35,430
that a million kids could do better on 
the

3069
02:18:35,560 --> 02:18:37,980
net right now.
Wasn't a fan of the new one.

3070
02:18:38,070 --> 02:18:39,980
I fell asleep like 15 times during that.

3071
02:18:40,040 --> 02:18:42,890
I didn't see the newest new one.
I saw the one before.

3072
02:18:42,891 --> 02:18:44,420
The new one.
We're a hunt solo dies.

3073
02:18:44,720 --> 02:18:45,980
I didn't see the newest.

3074
02:18:45,980 --> 02:18:48,570
The one I liked.
I liked the newest new one.

3075
02:18:48,630 --> 02:18:50,310
I heard the newest doin.
It was one of the best ones.

3076
02:18:50,311 --> 02:18:51,144
yeah,
definitely.

3077
02:18:51,250 --> 02:18:52,950
No,
I think it was boring as fuck.

3078
02:18:53,190 --> 02:18:55,720
Brian needed sleep that day.
Yeah.

3079
02:18:55,721 --> 02:18:59,880
You probably saw was because it was in 
three d,

3080
02:19:00,830 --> 02:19:01,663
three days,
and I know the three d was an after 

3081
02:19:03,690 --> 02:19:05,230
thought 3d,
you know,

3082
02:19:05,340 --> 02:19:06,010
where they're like,
yeah,

3083
02:19:06,010 --> 02:19:07,140
let's make a three d,
you know,

3084
02:19:07,141 --> 02:19:09,130
it wasn't anything awesome.
And uh,

3085
02:19:09,510 --> 02:19:11,520
I think I'd rather not have seen it in 
three d.

3086
02:19:11,521 --> 02:19:14,540
I think maybe that might've been it 
because it was so boring that I just.

3087
02:19:14,790 --> 02:19:16,530
And there was no three d going on,
so it was just like,

3088
02:19:17,130 --> 02:19:19,170
my eyes are getting tired.
I just need to sleep.

3089
02:19:19,560 --> 02:19:22,680
I kept on falling asleep.
They just sound unhealthy.

3090
02:19:22,760 --> 02:19:23,160
No,
no,

3091
02:19:23,160 --> 02:19:24,330
I'm clint.
But I thought it.

3092
02:19:24,331 --> 02:19:25,164
I thought it was just me,
like I thought it was something like I 

3093
02:19:26,491 --> 02:19:27,860
didn't have any sleep,

3094
02:19:28,130 --> 02:19:28,963
but then,
uh,

3095
02:19:29,000 --> 02:19:32,510
people I've read on twitter's a agree 
and said the same exact shit.

3096
02:19:32,511 --> 02:19:32,920
So

3097
02:19:32,920 --> 02:19:34,720
it's probably people that follow you and
they'll like,

3098
02:19:34,721 --> 02:19:35,620
I'm sleepy too.

3099
02:19:36,520 --> 02:19:37,353
Ha.
No,

3100
02:19:37,390 --> 02:19:41,320
I would like to see what you thought.
Eventually acting was horrible.

3101
02:19:41,500 --> 02:19:43,450
Really horrible.
I literally

3102
02:19:43,540 --> 02:19:45,650
no nothing crazy person.
Okay.

3103
02:19:45,850 --> 02:19:48,010
You know what?
I'm excited foR john wick two.

3104
02:19:49,570 --> 02:19:52,260
Now with that,
I just saw a good movie last take.

3105
02:19:52,340 --> 02:19:54,390
I shouldn't say good.
It was really,

3106
02:19:54,391 --> 02:19:56,050
it was pretty good.
It wasn't great.

3107
02:19:56,430 --> 02:19:57,700
Uh,
that movie split,

3108
02:19:57,730 --> 02:19:58,563
which is getting a lot of news right now
because I'm a ding dong movie did 

3109
02:20:01,391 --> 02:20:03,500
surprisingly well.
I guess it was,

3110
02:20:03,550 --> 02:20:05,350
keeps tricking me.
It wasn't a,

3111
02:20:05,470 --> 02:20:06,880
it wasn't one of those kind of like,
oh,

3112
02:20:06,881 --> 02:20:07,714
there's a big twist at the end.
Everyone is saying there's a twist at 

3113
02:20:09,281 --> 02:20:10,114
the end.
It's not that big of a fucking surprise 

3114
02:20:11,591 --> 02:20:12,424
or anything like that.
But the movie itself was pretty 

3115
02:20:14,021 --> 02:20:15,790
interesting.
It's about people with did,

3116
02:20:15,791 --> 02:20:19,720
which is disassociative disassociative 
identity disorder,

3117
02:20:20,560 --> 02:20:23,650
which is fucking weird.
I looked up some more stuff on it.

3118
02:20:24,550 --> 02:20:25,383
If it's real,
the way that this movie depicts it 

3119
02:20:28,090 --> 02:20:30,020
fucking insane.
But

3120
02:20:30,370 --> 02:20:32,530
well,
people definitely have blown brains,

3121
02:20:32,531 --> 02:20:36,340
you know.
But that night shama lama dang dong guy,

3122
02:20:36,490 --> 02:20:38,620
he got me with that fucking elevator 
movie.

3123
02:20:38,740 --> 02:20:39,161
I'm like,
oh,

3124
02:20:39,161 --> 02:20:41,710
watch.
This was in the elevator man.

3125
02:20:42,500 --> 02:20:45,670
I skipped a bunch of.
How might you motherfucker.

3126
02:20:46,380 --> 02:20:48,500
I think the marky mark one with the 
trees.

3127
02:20:48,890 --> 02:20:51,640
It kills the trees.
Come to live and kill folks.

3128
02:20:51,890 --> 02:20:53,230
Yeah,
you got me with that one too.

3129
02:20:53,440 --> 02:20:54,273
He got me with the village,
you know the people that live in the 

3130
02:20:56,021 --> 02:20:56,854
village,
they find out planes flying over the 

3131
02:20:57,911 --> 02:20:59,500
head.
They walk out to the road.

3132
02:20:59,740 --> 02:21:02,830
It's walking distance.
They didn't even bring food.

3133
02:21:03,400 --> 02:21:06,430
Sixth sense was cool.
Signs was scary at points,

3134
02:21:06,440 --> 02:21:07,110
but really

3135
02:21:07,110 --> 02:21:09,940
stop and think of how fucking stupid 
that village concept was.

3136
02:21:10,150 --> 02:21:10,983
They had this village,
they thought they were living in the 18 

3137
02:21:12,161 --> 02:21:13,070
hundreds.
We're all bummed,

3138
02:21:13,220 --> 02:21:15,640
but meanwhile they're in modern America.
Okay,

3139
02:21:15,760 --> 02:21:18,550
and the way this is an experiment in the
way that protects his experiment.

3140
02:21:18,700 --> 02:21:20,650
Planes didn't fly over it.
Oh,

3141
02:21:20,651 --> 02:21:23,900
okay.
Well surely you must be no fucking way.

3142
02:21:24,210 --> 02:21:26,610
We're near people because.
Oh,

3143
02:21:26,620 --> 02:21:27,950
you right over there.
Oh,

3144
02:21:27,960 --> 02:21:30,610
you can just walk.
You could just walk to the town and they

3145
02:21:30,611 --> 02:21:32,530
didn't find out about you all these 
years.

3146
02:21:32,710 --> 02:21:33,530
Fuck you.

3147
02:21:33,530 --> 02:21:34,820
Yeah,
fireworks.

3148
02:21:34,821 --> 02:21:36,200
Fourth of july.
Come on.

3149
02:21:36,880 --> 02:21:39,860
Something as the fuck outta here,
bitch.

3150
02:21:40,820 --> 02:21:44,240
I don't think I saw the village now that
I think about it so stupid.

3151
02:21:44,630 --> 02:21:47,420
It was so stupid and I thought it was 
about monsters to,

3152
02:21:47,421 --> 02:21:49,430
of the monsters were taking people what?
It's like people

3153
02:21:50,000 --> 02:21:52,900
you want your heart to Beat,
watch a movie called don't breathe,

3154
02:21:53,690 --> 02:21:56,090
unbelievable movie about a bunch of,
you know,

3155
02:21:56,260 --> 02:21:57,071
punk,
cool,

3156
02:21:57,071 --> 02:21:57,904
smart,
like thIeve kids that are coming up and 

3157
02:21:59,831 --> 02:22:02,380
like on a good run of robberies and they
go and they will,

3158
02:22:02,440 --> 02:22:07,440
they see that this former Vietnam vet,
a one like a ton of money and a law suit

3159
02:22:09,401 --> 02:22:10,234
and someone close to him at the bank 
said that he took it all out and cash 

3160
02:22:13,091 --> 02:22:13,924
and has it in his house.
Like so they got this hot tip that this 

3161
02:22:16,331 --> 02:22:17,164
guy has like a couple million in cash 
and his house and he's some old old 

3162
02:22:20,351 --> 02:22:22,330
Vietnam vet,
so let's do that.

3163
02:22:22,700 --> 02:22:25,330
Then they go to say anymore.
Yeah.

3164
02:22:25,620 --> 02:22:25,980
What the

3165
02:22:25,980 --> 02:22:27,840
fuck did I showed you the.
now that's it.

3166
02:22:27,870 --> 02:22:28,703
That's literally the setup to the 
trailer for this on the podcast and I 

3167
02:22:31,351 --> 02:22:33,830
mistakenly said it was the guy from the 
Kevin Smith movement.

3168
02:22:33,860 --> 02:22:35,430
You called it out as the guy from 
avatar.

3169
02:22:35,431 --> 02:22:37,180
Like the general.
Yeah,

3170
02:22:37,440 --> 02:22:38,040
yeah,
yeah.

3171
02:22:38,040 --> 02:22:38,630
Okay.
That's.

3172
02:22:38,630 --> 02:22:39,630
Now I remember it.
Yeah.

3173
02:22:39,660 --> 02:22:40,493
Don't breathe.
No one else is supposed to be really 

3174
02:22:41,281 --> 02:22:43,320
good.
There's a zombie movie,

3175
02:22:43,470 --> 02:22:44,303
but I think was made in england.
I think it's called a girl with all the 

3176
02:22:46,021 --> 02:22:51,021
gifts and it's about a kid that's a 
zombie,

3177
02:22:51,091 --> 02:22:56,091
like there's a disease and these people 
get it and it's not like some free.

3178
02:22:56,220 --> 02:22:57,053
It turns a frantic and this one girl,
I think they're using according to the 

3179
02:23:01,500 --> 02:23:03,180
trailer,
they're using her as a,

3180
02:23:03,181 --> 02:23:05,280
um,
like a to make a vaccine.

3181
02:23:06,870 --> 02:23:07,703
But these,
these Fucking pandemic disease movies 

3182
02:23:10,351 --> 02:23:12,360
where people go crazy and start killing 
each other.

3183
02:23:12,870 --> 02:23:15,480
They seem a little scarier now that 
trump's in office.

3184
02:23:16,830 --> 02:23:17,940
Right?
Serious about that.

3185
02:23:17,941 --> 02:23:20,610
Trump getting a mask thing.
Like how great that would be.

3186
02:23:21,420 --> 02:23:25,990
You were using your precedent,

3187
02:23:26,010 --> 02:23:28,260
dude,
you should've been here the inauguration

3188
02:23:28,261 --> 02:23:29,094
night now.
Figuration night we did a podcast and 

3189
02:23:30,451 --> 02:23:33,360
here with Jeff Ross and Jeff Ross was 
freaking me out.

3190
02:23:33,390 --> 02:23:35,610
He's knows trump.
He roasted trump is like,

3191
02:23:35,611 --> 02:23:36,444
he's never leaving.
He's going to be there for twentY years 

3192
02:23:38,940 --> 02:23:39,773
and he'll leave,
but It'll help make sure that somebody 

3193
02:23:41,191 --> 02:23:42,024
who's his friend gets elected and he'll 
be as advisor and he'll be right there 

3194
02:23:45,151 --> 02:23:46,980
with them.
THen his son will get in.

3195
02:23:47,250 --> 02:23:48,120
He's like,
that's it,

3196
02:23:48,121 --> 02:23:51,390
it's over.
Now he's in that says wow,

3197
02:23:51,510 --> 02:23:52,343
and then the moment he gets in,
he takes the lbgt page off the white 

3198
02:23:56,401 --> 02:23:58,050
house and he takes.

3199
02:23:59,230 --> 02:24:00,063
No,
I know that happens with every 

3200
02:24:01,281 --> 02:24:03,410
presidential change.
I read a whole thing about that.

3201
02:24:03,470 --> 02:24:05,680
They take the lbgt archive everything.

3202
02:24:05,880 --> 02:24:09,750
They take everything from everybody's 
thing and completely scratch it

3203
02:24:09,750 --> 02:24:12,360
and then they put up the new page,
the new president.

3204
02:24:12,480 --> 02:24:16,170
It doesn't give a fuck about lbgt.
Who doesn't give a fuck about you?

3205
02:24:16,180 --> 02:24:18,940
Climate change and it doesn't give a 
fuck about civil rights.

3206
02:24:19,000 --> 02:24:21,910
Same thing.
Still the same thing no matter what,

3207
02:24:22,240 --> 02:24:25,270
like what he decided to remove and 
replace,

3208
02:24:25,510 --> 02:24:28,380
but I think it's like a process that 
right,

3209
02:24:28,420 --> 02:24:29,253
is it?
I don't think they would have a website 

3210
02:24:30,491 --> 02:24:31,040
in place.

3211
02:24:31,040 --> 02:24:34,070
I read a whole thing and maybe I can't.
Again,

3212
02:24:34,071 --> 02:24:36,560
I can't cite the source because like I 
told jerry earlier,

3213
02:24:36,620 --> 02:24:40,250
smoking twice as much as I ever have 
before in my life.

3214
02:24:40,280 --> 02:24:41,113
So like.
But I read that that's the thing that 

3215
02:24:43,341 --> 02:24:44,174
happened when barack took office.
Like a lot of this stuff by the way 

3216
02:24:46,971 --> 02:24:51,500
that's happening is stuff that is a very
regular thing,

3217
02:24:51,650 --> 02:24:54,080
like people are freaking out about his 
cabinet picks,

3218
02:24:54,081 --> 02:24:56,510
but I read a whole thing on that where 
it's like,

3219
02:24:56,511 --> 02:25:00,110
yeah,
that's how this stuff works still to get

3220
02:25:00,111 --> 02:25:01,130
approved by this and it.

3221
02:25:01,680 --> 02:25:04,320
His cabinet picks tell a lot about his 
intentions.

3222
02:25:04,321 --> 02:25:05,041
You know,
like the guy,

3223
02:25:05,041 --> 02:25:07,010
the former exxon ceo and.

3224
02:25:08,040 --> 02:25:11,030
But don't you think that's sort of good 
to have a.

3225
02:25:11,200 --> 02:25:12,033
Do you know that you put a five year,
like he's the first president to say 

3226
02:25:14,521 --> 02:25:17,830
that you can't just go join lobbies,
you can't be a light switch,

3227
02:25:17,850 --> 02:25:18,683
you're not going to get rich off of me.
So I think maybe if that guy who he 

3228
02:25:22,441 --> 02:25:24,880
interviewed who's trump known for hiring
people,

3229
02:25:24,940 --> 02:25:29,940
that's what his specialty is.
It if he hired that guy for a reason and

3230
02:25:30,791 --> 02:25:33,880
if it's because he's such a fucking 
freak that he might be one of the people

3231
02:25:33,881 --> 02:25:34,714
that fix the economy.
Look how much money you made mobile 

3232
02:25:36,491 --> 02:25:37,324
exxon.
I'm just saying that if he's right then 

3233
02:25:39,640 --> 02:25:41,050
fuck.
That'd be so great.

3234
02:25:41,500 --> 02:25:44,080
I'm rooting for the guy.
It seems scary,

3235
02:25:45,570 --> 02:25:46,403
right about what the problem is.
Everyone knows is a real transparent 

3236
02:25:49,501 --> 02:25:50,334
deal that obama blocked or exxon was 
trying to drill and they were trying to 

3237
02:25:54,781 --> 02:25:57,440
make this deal with Russia and exxon 
got,

3238
02:25:57,520 --> 02:25:58,353
they got cock blocked by obama and now 
that obama's out and then the Former 

3239
02:26:01,831 --> 02:26:06,831
exxon ceo is in like and people were 
wondering like,

3240
02:26:07,440 --> 02:26:11,610
are they doing something that the 
environmentalist thing could potentially

3241
02:26:11,611 --> 02:26:15,240
be a huge disaster and then they doing 
it for profit.

3242
02:26:15,720 --> 02:26:17,550
I don't know.
I don't follow it enough.

3243
02:26:17,790 --> 02:26:20,970
That's when I'm not optimistic though.
That's when I get nervous,

3244
02:26:21,270 --> 02:26:22,103
you know?
But then again Like things like this 

3245
02:26:22,741 --> 02:26:24,300
dakota pipeline,
you know about that,

3246
02:26:24,301 --> 02:26:26,010
right?
The dakota pipeline,

3247
02:26:26,011 --> 02:26:27,840
they were trying to.
I mean they fucking did man.

3248
02:26:27,841 --> 02:26:30,510
They arrested people for trying to 
protest them.

3249
02:26:30,600 --> 02:26:34,740
This government decided and this 
easement,

3250
02:26:34,890 --> 02:26:38,360
they decided to put through people's 
private land that these are.

3251
02:26:38,370 --> 02:26:39,203
THese guys had ranchers.
There's a river that runs through them 

3252
02:26:41,441 --> 02:26:45,310
and they wanted a drill this pipeline 
right under the river and if it blue,

3253
02:26:45,700 --> 02:26:47,610
you know,
which they do all the time.

3254
02:26:47,820 --> 02:26:48,653
If it goes bad,
this whole river system gets totally 

3255
02:26:50,881 --> 02:26:54,240
poisoned and they successfully blocked 
it,

3256
02:26:54,241 --> 02:26:58,860
but people had to,
they had to put a lot of blood,

3257
02:26:58,861 --> 02:27:01,860
sweat and tears into it and had a 
protest for a long time.

3258
02:27:01,861 --> 02:27:05,430
They got shot at with water hoses and 
that cold weather

3259
02:27:05,480 --> 02:27:07,280
that happened under obama's watch 
though,

3260
02:27:07,281 --> 02:27:08,114
right?
Yep.

3261
02:27:08,170 --> 02:27:09,290
Yep.
So I mean,

3262
02:27:09,291 --> 02:27:10,760
it's one of those things where it's 
like,

3263
02:27:10,850 --> 02:27:11,683
absolutely.
At least we're learning that if you do 

3264
02:27:13,580 --> 02:27:14,413
have to make some sacrifices and 
protests and certain situation like 

3265
02:27:16,941 --> 02:27:18,560
that,
that maybe it will work.

3266
02:27:18,960 --> 02:27:19,793
I guess it is interesting that it 
happened under obama's watch and he 

3267
02:27:21,631 --> 02:27:24,360
didn't do jack shit about it and he 
didn't freak out.

3268
02:27:24,390 --> 02:27:27,360
He had to have been aware.
He had to know that these people are.

3269
02:27:27,380 --> 02:27:29,640
They're protesting a very dangerous 
situation.

3270
02:27:30,660 --> 02:27:32,400
It's all fucked up,
man.

3271
02:27:32,610 --> 02:27:35,520
There's so much profit to be made and 
then these guys have to think,

3272
02:27:35,521 --> 02:27:36,420
hey,
you know,

3273
02:27:36,421 --> 02:27:38,640
if we don't do this,
then we're reliant upon the salt.

3274
02:27:38,641 --> 02:27:40,740
Number nine is gold underwear,
you know,

3275
02:27:40,750 --> 02:27:42,630
because that's the only place where 
we're going to get our oil from.

3276
02:27:42,660 --> 02:27:43,493
Right.
We have to get our oil from the middle 

3277
02:27:44,251 --> 02:27:45,750
east.
Should we get it ourselves?

3278
02:27:45,751 --> 02:27:47,310
Should we get it this way?
Is that better?

3279
02:27:47,340 --> 02:27:48,173
Is it better for our country?
How do we do it without fucking up the 

3280
02:27:50,071 --> 02:27:51,780
environment?
Can you prove to me that we're not going

3281
02:27:51,781 --> 02:27:52,614
to fuck up the environment and then they
think they do and then they go out and 

3282
02:27:54,871 --> 02:27:55,531
they'll go,
oh sir,

3283
02:27:55,531 --> 02:27:56,364
we've got a problem.
Earthquakes have increased by 500 

3284
02:27:57,991 --> 02:28:00,780
percent earthquakes.
what do you mean earthquakes?

3285
02:28:00,960 --> 02:28:03,870
Well,
we didn't anticipate this,

3286
02:28:03,871 --> 02:28:06,660
but apparently when you frack and drill 
holes in the ground,

3287
02:28:06,661 --> 02:28:07,494
the earth shifts and we have some 
serious earthquakes and unfortunately 

3288
02:28:10,381 --> 02:28:11,214
because of that shifting,
some of the shit has gotten into the 

3289
02:28:12,640 --> 02:28:13,473
water and that's where.
THat's where they are right now in 

3290
02:28:17,251 --> 02:28:19,020
Oklahoma,
Oklahoma,

3291
02:28:19,080 --> 02:28:22,040
they're having a fuck ton of earthquakes
and they trying to figure

3292
02:28:22,040 --> 02:28:25,040
out what to do because these guys are 
just digging holes in the ground.

3293
02:28:25,520 --> 02:28:26,510
I mean,
we're crazy.

3294
02:28:26,511 --> 02:28:27,344
Monsters were like termites.
Termites were digging holes into the 

3295
02:28:31,041 --> 02:28:34,190
ground and we're sucking up all the 
juicy stuff so we can light fires.

3296
02:28:35,900 --> 02:28:38,240
That's what we're doing.
We're lighting fires,

3297
02:28:38,360 --> 02:28:42,080
were leaded gas fires in oil fighters.
We just contain them inside these mental

3298
02:28:42,081 --> 02:28:43,100
blocks.
I mean,

3299
02:28:43,101 --> 02:28:47,210
that's what we're doing the world were.
We need all this stuff for is combustion

3300
02:28:47,211 --> 02:28:50,630
engines and make the make plastics so we
could choke birds.

3301
02:28:51,510 --> 02:28:53,750
That's what we're doing.
We're choking birds,

3302
02:28:54,070 --> 02:28:55,790
choking birds,
enlightened fires.

3303
02:28:55,960 --> 02:28:56,793
They're going to tap our natural 
resources on federal lands according to 

3304
02:29:01,600 --> 02:29:06,520
the first energy plan on the white house
website says we have a quote from,

3305
02:29:06,521 --> 02:29:09,220
we must take advantage of the estimated 
$50,000,000,000,000

3306
02:29:09,221 --> 02:29:11,380
and untapped shale oil,
natural gas reserves,

3307
02:29:11,381 --> 02:29:14,110
especially those on the federal lands 
that the american people own.

3308
02:29:15,990 --> 02:29:17,220
That's super interesting.

3309
02:29:17,340 --> 02:29:20,250
That's terrible thing.
That's a terrible thing.

3310
02:29:20,280 --> 02:29:21,113
Yeah.
That's a terrible thing because that's 

3311
02:29:21,931 --> 02:29:23,460
what we're talking about with teddy 
roosevelt,

3312
02:29:23,461 --> 02:29:24,294
the public land and having public land 
and how it's such a huge issue in such 

3313
02:29:28,301 --> 02:29:29,134
a.
An amazing resource like places like 

3314
02:29:30,991 --> 02:29:31,824
yellowstone,
like all these places where you can go 

3315
02:29:35,341 --> 02:29:38,990
and hike and camp and fish and hunt and 
do whatever you want.

3316
02:29:39,000 --> 02:29:39,833
Enjoy is insane piece of nature that we 
have here or this insane piece of 

3317
02:29:44,341 --> 02:29:48,330
wilderness.
We have an amazing public land system in

3318
02:29:48,331 --> 02:29:49,164
this country and there's a bunch of 
people that are working really hard to 

3319
02:29:51,511 --> 02:29:54,210
keep that in place,
but when they start talking about,

3320
02:29:54,540 --> 02:29:57,750
taken out the natural resources and 
drilling into it and shit,

3321
02:29:58,060 --> 02:30:00,400
it doesn't look good.
Alright.

3322
02:30:00,450 --> 02:30:03,870
Everybody's checking their watches time 
again out of here by 1230.

3323
02:30:04,770 --> 02:30:06,330
We should have enough.
We did like two hours,

3324
02:30:06,331 --> 02:30:07,440
right?
And maybe two houRs.

3325
02:30:07,530 --> 02:30:08,510
Two hours.
Two and a half.

3326
02:30:08,780 --> 02:30:10,170
Two and a half hours.
Jesus christ.

3327
02:30:10,260 --> 02:30:11,580
Enough.
Enough already.

3328
02:30:11,670 --> 02:30:12,241
Okay,
everybody.

3329
02:30:12,241 --> 02:30:13,890
Bye.
Say bye.

3330
02:30:14,760 --> 02:30:15,660
Say bye.
Bye.

3331
02:30:15,661 --> 02:30:16,231
Bye.
Bye.

3332
02:30:16,231 --> 02:30:18,210
Bye.
We'll probably do this again.

3333
02:30:18,300 --> 02:30:19,320
Hey,
maybe next one.

3334
02:30:19,321 --> 02:30:20,154
We'll deal with trying to do on stage.
Who knows or we'll sneak one in here 

3335
02:30:22,500 --> 02:30:25,770
where we don't have people coming down 
and knock on the door and trying to take

3336
02:30:25,771 --> 02:30:27,420
selfies in front of the door.
Hey,

come see me.
Do stand up comedy for me.

3338
