1
00:00:01,030 --> 00:00:01,863
Hello

2
00:00:02,140 --> 00:00:02,973
bitches.

3
00:00:03,070 --> 00:00:03,881
I would love to play you.

4
00:00:03,881 --> 00:00:06,010
The dinosaurs are not real video.

5
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:07,030
Do it.

6
00:00:07,030 --> 00:00:07,410
God.

7
00:00:07,410 --> 00:00:08,860
See if he flagged JV.

8
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:11,800
We probably can't play it on
youtube where we'll get pulled,

9
00:00:11,801 --> 00:00:12,634
but we can play the Wii,

10
00:00:12,670 --> 00:00:13,391
the audio,

11
00:00:13,391 --> 00:00:14,224
right,

12
00:00:14,410 --> 00:00:15,001
play the audio.

13
00:00:15,001 --> 00:00:17,680
We'll put the video up on the
screen and play the audio for you.

14
00:00:17,681 --> 00:00:18,640
And you could just fucking,

15
00:00:18,970 --> 00:00:22,330
your head could turn beet red
smokes can come out of your ears.

16
00:00:22,630 --> 00:00:24,700
Because the thing is about these videos,

17
00:00:24,730 --> 00:00:27,460
and this is the issue that
I have with not just videos,

18
00:00:27,461 --> 00:00:29,230
but also with blogs.

19
00:00:30,570 --> 00:00:31,270
People,

20
00:00:31,270 --> 00:00:33,550
you're writing things and you're not,

21
00:00:33,551 --> 00:00:35,650
you're not being checked
as you're going along.

22
00:00:35,651 --> 00:00:36,340
So it's,

23
00:00:36,340 --> 00:00:38,800
it's just you broadcasting and idea.

24
00:00:38,801 --> 00:00:40,030
It's not a conversation.

25
00:00:40,060 --> 00:00:40,930
And because of that,

26
00:00:41,410 --> 00:00:44,980
you can give off the illusion of
expertise without being checked.

27
00:00:44,981 --> 00:00:45,521
Here it goes.

28
00:00:45,521 --> 00:00:47,140
Dinosaurs never existed.

29
00:00:47,370 --> 00:00:48,191
And by my God,

30
00:00:48,191 --> 00:00:49,150
Eric to bay,

31
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:49,800
this is the,

32
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:50,690
the flat Earth Guy.

33
00:00:50,710 --> 00:00:50,800
Yeah.

34
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:52,260
The guy that does 200 proofs,

35
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:53,230
the earth is flat.

36
00:00:54,850 --> 00:00:56,350
Everybody has debunked.

37
00:00:56,351 --> 00:00:57,184
Fucking,

38
00:00:57,400 --> 00:00:58,380
oh no,

39
00:00:58,410 --> 00:00:58,571
no,

40
00:00:58,571 --> 00:00:58,751
no.

41
00:00:58,751 --> 00:01:02,500
Shills shows or listen to this guy

42
00:01:03,020 --> 00:01:04,410
of the royal society.

43
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:06,590
Don't you dare mention
anyone's name assholes,

44
00:01:06,930 --> 00:01:11,610
natural history department
in 1842 or in other words,

45
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:16,880
the existence of dinosaurs was first
speculatively hypothesized by young

46
00:01:17,641 --> 00:01:19,200
knighted museum head.

47
00:01:19,380 --> 00:01:22,470
Coincidentally in the mid 19th century,

48
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:27,680
during the heyday of evolutionism before
a single dinosaur fossil had ever been

49
00:01:27,811 --> 00:01:28,890
found wrong.

50
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:30,720
They sound pause,

51
00:01:30,990 --> 00:01:31,890
pause every time.

52
00:01:31,891 --> 00:01:32,610
Pause,

53
00:01:32,610 --> 00:01:33,443
uh,

54
00:01:33,510 --> 00:01:34,740
dinosaurs.

55
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:35,760
Uh,

56
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:36,041
we,

57
00:01:36,041 --> 00:01:40,380
we discovered marine reptiles and the
first dinosaurs about a century before

58
00:01:40,381 --> 00:01:41,214
that.

59
00:01:41,370 --> 00:01:42,690
So that right there,

60
00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:43,350
Eric,

61
00:01:43,350 --> 00:01:44,310
you're fucking wrong.

62
00:01:45,570 --> 00:01:47,040
Wups it's like,

63
00:01:47,310 --> 00:01:50,310
don't bring your flat Earth
Bullshit into my profession.

64
00:01:50,311 --> 00:01:51,240
Now I'm pissed.

65
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:52,171
But keep going.

66
00:01:52,171 --> 00:01:52,440
Yeah,

67
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:52,801
keep,

68
00:01:52,801 --> 00:01:53,634
keep us rolling

69
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:55,360
and stream.

70
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:56,380
Press worldwide.

71
00:01:56,660 --> 00:02:00,790
Got To work hyping stories of
these supposedly long lost animals.

72
00:02:00,940 --> 00:02:02,650
And then Lo and behold,

73
00:02:02,830 --> 00:02:05,470
12 years later in 1854,

74
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:07,860
Ferdinand Vandeveer Hayden,

75
00:02:08,170 --> 00:02:11,230
during his exploration of
the upper Missouri River,

76
00:02:11,470 --> 00:02:13,990
found proof of Owen's theory.

77
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:19,500
A few unidentified teeth he mailed to
leading paleontologist Joseph Leidy,

78
00:02:20,590 --> 00:02:25,590
who several years later declared them
to be from an ancient extinct track,

79
00:02:25,621 --> 00:02:26,980
a don dinosaur,

80
00:02:27,370 --> 00:02:28,690
which beyond ironic.

81
00:02:29,290 --> 00:02:29,970
So

82
00:02:29,970 --> 00:02:34,830
that's because we can do things like
look at modern analogs and see how teeth

83
00:02:34,831 --> 00:02:35,850
are fucking made.

84
00:02:37,110 --> 00:02:40,230
We know if it's a Predator or if its prey,

85
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:42,960
we know if it's an
herbivore or a carnivore,

86
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:45,090
we know how teeth are fucking built.

87
00:02:45,390 --> 00:02:46,350
Even back then,

88
00:02:46,351 --> 00:02:48,660
even when they're doing
naturalistic drawings like this,

89
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:49,600
it's like,

90
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:50,240
like the,

91
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:50,461
the,

92
00:02:50,461 --> 00:02:51,000
the,

93
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,740
the mcgalin on tooth on my arm.

94
00:02:52,890 --> 00:02:53,850
It is a predator.

95
00:02:53,851 --> 00:02:56,400
It's obviously a [inaudible]
Galla don or mega.

96
00:02:56,401 --> 00:02:56,810
Dot.

97
00:02:56,810 --> 00:02:57,643
How do you say it?

98
00:02:57,990 --> 00:02:58,711
It depends on your,

99
00:02:58,711 --> 00:03:00,730
you're in fast as can be
on a different syllable.

100
00:03:01,430 --> 00:03:02,470
It's both.

101
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:04,840
It's not like nuclear new Cuellar no,

102
00:03:04,870 --> 00:03:07,690
no cause cause it doesn't have to use,

103
00:03:08,470 --> 00:03:09,303
um,

104
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:10,930
but it's spelled,

105
00:03:10,931 --> 00:03:13,870
it's spelled the same but it's
like dimetrodon or dimetrodon.

106
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:14,040
Oh,

107
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:16,670
it's the same thing in the [inaudible] on,

108
00:03:17,350 --> 00:03:18,160
Oh God,

109
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:19,150
you're God.

110
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:20,313
Keep doing this.

111
00:03:20,410 --> 00:03:20,780
What is it?

112
00:03:20,780 --> 00:03:21,613
20 minutes.

113
00:03:22,180 --> 00:03:23,013
Firstly,

114
00:03:23,230 --> 00:03:27,760
needless to say that it is impossible
to reconstruct an entire hypothetical

115
00:03:27,761 --> 00:03:30,280
ancient animal based on a few teeth.

116
00:03:30,910 --> 00:03:32,290
But even more importantly,

117
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:35,190
it is dubious that a myriad of tile,

118
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:37,690
bird and reptile mammal,

119
00:03:37,691 --> 00:03:42,691
transitional forms necessary for the
blossoming theory of evolution would be

120
00:03:42,820 --> 00:03:47,820
hypothesized and then conveniently
discovered by teams of evolutionist

121
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:52,600
archeologists purposely out
looking to find such fossils.

122
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:58,080
It is even more dubious that such fossils
have supposedly existed for millions

123
00:03:58,810 --> 00:03:58,990
of years,

124
00:03:58,990 --> 00:04:03,550
but we're never found by or known to
any civilization in the history of

125
00:04:03,551 --> 00:04:04,384
humanity.

126
00:04:04,570 --> 00:04:05,680
Kill evolution.

127
00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:06,971
Okay.

128
00:04:06,971 --> 00:04:07,330
Yeah.

129
00:04:07,330 --> 00:04:11,320
The reason why we didn't know about
things beforehand because we weren't doing

130
00:04:11,321 --> 00:04:16,321
shit like wholesale intellectual studies
of science when people were building

131
00:04:16,841 --> 00:04:18,910
fucking pyramids and stuff like that.

132
00:04:19,180 --> 00:04:21,940
That's why we have different ages in,

133
00:04:21,941 --> 00:04:23,590
throughout anthropological records.

134
00:04:23,591 --> 00:04:27,430
We have the brand age and Iron Age and
all that because we have to do things

135
00:04:27,431 --> 00:04:29,980
like figure out the land around us.

136
00:04:30,190 --> 00:04:32,650
And when we start finding
really old bones like,

137
00:04:32,710 --> 00:04:33,370
hey,

138
00:04:33,370 --> 00:04:35,260
this looks like a really big chicken bone.

139
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:36,153
What the fuck?

140
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:39,010
Or this looks like a huge
human with a single eye.

141
00:04:39,190 --> 00:04:40,023
What the fuck?

142
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:45,120
We start looking at stuff like that saying
just wholesale fucking bullshit like

143
00:04:45,911 --> 00:04:46,744
that.

144
00:04:47,090 --> 00:04:47,923
Goddamn.

145
00:04:48,450 --> 00:04:48,880
Ah,

146
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:49,550
but that's a,

147
00:04:49,550 --> 00:04:54,190
that's what a youtube videos and
youtube conspiracy theory video is.

148
00:04:54,210 --> 00:04:54,311
Oh,

149
00:04:54,311 --> 00:04:54,690
I know.

150
00:04:54,690 --> 00:04:57,160
One person getting to spill.

151
00:04:57,161 --> 00:04:59,770
There's nonsense and w there unchecked.

152
00:04:59,790 --> 00:04:59,881
Yeah.

153
00:04:59,881 --> 00:05:01,810
This is why I wanted to play this for you.

154
00:05:02,020 --> 00:05:02,853
And,

155
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:03,753
um,

156
00:05:04,210 --> 00:05:04,630
uh,

157
00:05:04,630 --> 00:05:07,570
response videos can be blocked
by the original person.

158
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:10,030
They can curate all comments.

159
00:05:10,450 --> 00:05:12,280
They can only allow certain ones through.

160
00:05:12,281 --> 00:05:13,360
They can moderate everything.

161
00:05:13,361 --> 00:05:14,200
Same with a blog.

162
00:05:14,201 --> 00:05:15,034
Same with all of that.

163
00:05:15,250 --> 00:05:17,530
They control their own criticism.

164
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:20,790
There's a guy right now that
a lot of the Paleo community,

165
00:05:20,791 --> 00:05:21,611
he's going after.

166
00:05:21,611 --> 00:05:22,660
His name's David Peters.

167
00:05:22,660 --> 00:05:23,710
He's a jackass,

168
00:05:24,190 --> 00:05:25,023
um,

169
00:05:25,150 --> 00:05:30,150
who's like doing stupid things like all
reptiles or mammals and all of these

170
00:05:30,310 --> 00:05:32,770
claims should be in this
and just all this crap.

171
00:05:33,310 --> 00:05:34,143
Um,

172
00:05:34,270 --> 00:05:37,660
he wholesale copied an article from,

173
00:05:37,661 --> 00:05:39,760
a colleague of mine posted it,

174
00:05:40,630 --> 00:05:45,370
which is violation of copyright because
he's attempting to supersede that work

175
00:05:45,371 --> 00:05:48,100
by importing his own ideas to it.

176
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:53,350
He will refuse any critical comments
to be posted on his wordpress site.

177
00:05:54,270 --> 00:05:54,790
That's a little,

178
00:05:54,790 --> 00:05:55,900
it's really common now.

179
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:56,260
Yeah.

180
00:05:56,260 --> 00:05:57,800
It's really common with people.

181
00:05:57,870 --> 00:06:00,680
The war of ideas in the comment section.

182
00:06:00,681 --> 00:06:01,670
That's where it's being fought.

183
00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:01,940
Yeah.

184
00:06:01,940 --> 00:06:03,710
It's because it's an echo chamber.

185
00:06:03,770 --> 00:06:04,100
Yeah.

186
00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:08,180
It's like people don't look as why do
people think the world is flat or why do

187
00:06:08,181 --> 00:06:10,220
people think dinosaurs don't exist there?

188
00:06:10,221 --> 00:06:15,050
Google boolean search is dinosaurs
don't exist or creationism is true.

189
00:06:15,290 --> 00:06:16,490
Evolution is false.

190
00:06:16,580 --> 00:06:17,570
The earth is flat.

191
00:06:17,571 --> 00:06:18,560
Chem trails exist.

192
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:22,490
They're creating their own echo chamber
and preaching to their own fucking

193
00:06:22,491 --> 00:06:23,170
choir,

194
00:06:23,170 --> 00:06:25,810
and then they have a message board
and then go on that message board.

195
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:27,530
Massive confirmation bias.

196
00:06:27,531 --> 00:06:28,364
Nobody,

197
00:06:28,370 --> 00:06:31,730
anybody that doesn't follow
that line gets booted out.

198
00:06:31,940 --> 00:06:33,310
Let's play more of this because it gets,

199
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:34,153
it gets better.

200
00:06:34,570 --> 00:06:37,990
Journalism's May sonic renaissance
in the mid 19th century,

201
00:06:38,830 --> 00:06:39,910
David was and he wrote,

202
00:06:40,060 --> 00:06:44,620
why are there no discoveries by native
Americans in all the years previous when

203
00:06:44,621 --> 00:06:47,920
they roamed the American continents
because they weren't doing a fucking earth

204
00:06:47,921 --> 00:06:51,670
dinosaurs in the native American religion
or tradition because they were all

205
00:06:51,671 --> 00:06:52,510
dead that matter.

206
00:06:52,780 --> 00:06:56,950
Why would there no discoveries prior
to the 19th century in any part of the

207
00:06:56,951 --> 00:06:58,210
world there could have gone.

208
00:06:58,220 --> 00:06:59,410
You didn't know what it was.

209
00:06:59,590 --> 00:07:00,670
That's to the world book.

210
00:07:01,340 --> 00:07:03,400
It's like the same thing
with mammoth cyclops.

211
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:03,800
Yeah.

212
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:05,030
We didn't know what the fuck it was.

213
00:07:05,031 --> 00:07:05,421
We didn't know.

214
00:07:05,421 --> 00:07:06,290
It was a massive,

215
00:07:06,670 --> 00:07:08,360
a massive elephant species.

216
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:10,850
We thought it was a giant person.

217
00:07:10,851 --> 00:07:11,210
Yeah.

218
00:07:11,210 --> 00:07:14,200
When the first animals were
discovered in the liberate tarpits,

219
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:14,780
uh,

220
00:07:14,780 --> 00:07:16,100
before 1913,

221
00:07:16,550 --> 00:07:19,370
they thought it was livestock that
got trapped in there and died.

222
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:21,200
Then they realized,

223
00:07:21,201 --> 00:07:25,460
holy fuck cows don't have nine
inch long incisors that are,

224
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:26,480
you know,

225
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:29,150
perfectly evolved to slash
open the throats of things.

226
00:07:29,990 --> 00:07:31,100
And then you started questioning.

227
00:07:31,130 --> 00:07:35,570
So the native Americans and all the
people they were finding possibly scatters

228
00:07:35,571 --> 00:07:37,520
of bone and didn't know what it was.

229
00:07:38,060 --> 00:07:38,420
Uh,

230
00:07:38,420 --> 00:07:39,650
did the uh,

231
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:41,060
did the northern uh,

232
00:07:41,090 --> 00:07:44,450
first people start
licking bones and rocks?

233
00:07:44,750 --> 00:07:45,410
No,

234
00:07:45,410 --> 00:07:45,661
we,

235
00:07:45,661 --> 00:07:46,760
we discovered that,

236
00:07:46,820 --> 00:07:47,370
you know,

237
00:07:47,370 --> 00:07:49,070
the science as it figures out going,

238
00:07:49,071 --> 00:07:49,610
hey,

239
00:07:49,610 --> 00:07:50,960
this is porous material.

240
00:07:51,050 --> 00:07:52,580
If I lik porous material,

241
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:53,990
it's going to stick to my tongue.

242
00:07:54,050 --> 00:07:54,801
Holy Fuck,

243
00:07:54,801 --> 00:07:55,634
that's a fossil.

244
00:07:57,320 --> 00:07:57,531
This,

245
00:07:57,531 --> 00:07:57,800
this,

246
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:59,660
this kind of just,

247
00:07:59,780 --> 00:08:00,590
he,

248
00:08:00,590 --> 00:08:02,090
the problem with you Eric,

249
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:06,080
is you are starting from
an improper position.

250
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:09,200
You are starting on a confirmation bias.

251
00:08:09,620 --> 00:08:14,620
You are stating from the beginning that
dinosaurs don't exist and you were using

252
00:08:15,260 --> 00:08:20,260
pair of Delia and apathy Enia the ability
for humans to find patterns in order

253
00:08:20,390 --> 00:08:25,390
to fit your bullshit and then
only cherry pick what belongs.

254
00:08:27,230 --> 00:08:27,531
That's,

255
00:08:27,531 --> 00:08:27,980
that's what,

256
00:08:27,980 --> 00:08:29,480
that's what he does
with fucking flat earth.

257
00:08:30,020 --> 00:08:32,150
And the problem with this is
like I was saying earlier,

258
00:08:32,151 --> 00:08:36,440
because now the stupid
minority has a voice.

259
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:37,880
All,

260
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:41,150
I dunno how many million people
subscribe to his fucking channel.

261
00:08:41,930 --> 00:08:46,930
Every single flat earth dip shit
is going to go 61,000 people.

262
00:08:47,780 --> 00:08:48,230
Okay,

263
00:08:48,230 --> 00:08:51,830
look at that 300,000 views
and here's the thing.

264
00:08:51,831 --> 00:08:53,000
Check out the comments.

265
00:08:53,001 --> 00:08:57,390
The comments he calms
down are almost identical.

266
00:08:57,480 --> 00:08:57,691
Look,

267
00:08:57,691 --> 00:09:00,870
34 86 to 34 94 are you kidding me?

268
00:09:03,780 --> 00:09:04,770
Son of a bitch.

269
00:09:04,790 --> 00:09:05,140
Oh,

270
00:09:05,140 --> 00:09:08,880
but I remember being forced to
have the same dinosaur toys.

271
00:09:08,881 --> 00:09:10,080
Is Everyone Matt?

272
00:09:10,110 --> 00:09:10,441
Yeah,

273
00:09:10,441 --> 00:09:12,540
that's because it's called consumerism.

274
00:09:12,930 --> 00:09:13,561
Flat Earth.

275
00:09:13,561 --> 00:09:14,161
No dinosaur.

276
00:09:14,161 --> 00:09:15,210
What's the point in making these?

277
00:09:15,270 --> 00:09:15,720
Okay.

278
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:16,140
See,

279
00:09:16,140 --> 00:09:16,500
good.

280
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:17,310
Good for you.

281
00:09:17,310 --> 00:09:18,143
Go in there.

282
00:09:19,410 --> 00:09:20,700
Extremely great research.

283
00:09:20,730 --> 00:09:21,563
Love this very much.

284
00:09:21,610 --> 00:09:23,730
Thank you Max Haskins.

285
00:09:24,150 --> 00:09:24,983
Don't breed.

286
00:09:26,660 --> 00:09:28,200
Don't ruin dinosaurs with facts.

287
00:09:28,230 --> 00:09:29,370
Fuck you.

288
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:30,180
And there's more.

289
00:09:30,180 --> 00:09:31,140
My favorite animal.

290
00:09:31,170 --> 00:09:32,130
Here's another problem.

291
00:09:32,190 --> 00:09:33,630
His voice is annoying as fuck.

292
00:09:33,631 --> 00:09:34,171
Oh my God,

293
00:09:34,171 --> 00:09:34,890
let's play more.

294
00:09:34,890 --> 00:09:36,150
Oh thanks.

295
00:09:36,750 --> 00:09:37,583
Good luck to you.

296
00:09:37,890 --> 00:09:42,690
Before the 18 hundreds no one ever knew
that dinosaurs existed during the late

297
00:09:42,691 --> 00:09:47,280
18 hundreds early 19 hundreds large
deposits of dinosaur remains were

298
00:09:47,281 --> 00:09:48,114
discovered.

299
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:51,150
Why has man suddenly made
all these discoveries?

300
00:09:51,660 --> 00:09:52,500
No tribes,

301
00:09:52,501 --> 00:09:56,970
cultures or countries in the world ever
discovered a dinosaur bone before the

302
00:09:56,971 --> 00:10:01,230
mid 18 hundreds and then they were
suddenly found all over the world in North

303
00:10:01,231 --> 00:10:01,771
America,

304
00:10:01,771 --> 00:10:02,581
South America,

305
00:10:02,581 --> 00:10:03,090
Europe,

306
00:10:03,090 --> 00:10:03,541
Asia,

307
00:10:03,541 --> 00:10:04,320
Africa,

308
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:05,040
Argentina,

309
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:05,491
Belgium,

310
00:10:05,491 --> 00:10:06,180
Mongolia,

311
00:10:06,180 --> 00:10:06,811
Tanzania,

312
00:10:06,811 --> 00:10:11,811
West Germany and many other places
apparently had larger deposits of dinosaur

313
00:10:11,881 --> 00:10:12,391
fossils.

314
00:10:12,391 --> 00:10:13,470
Never before seen.

315
00:10:13,890 --> 00:10:17,100
Well because we find the
first one and then we're like,

316
00:10:17,190 --> 00:10:18,150
Holy Shit,

317
00:10:18,210 --> 00:10:19,980
there must be more of these out there.

318
00:10:20,430 --> 00:10:23,310
And then the bone more started
between Ogden and marsh.

319
00:10:23,490 --> 00:10:25,920
You had the man tell collection
with the first Iguanas,

320
00:10:25,921 --> 00:10:30,921
Don that was found and they put it and
they made these really stupid statues and

321
00:10:31,381 --> 00:10:33,300
put them in Crystal Palace in London.

322
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:35,150
And uh,

323
00:10:35,220 --> 00:10:36,150
Mary Anning,

324
00:10:36,510 --> 00:10:40,530
one of the first theme will be
first female pal paleontologist.

325
00:10:40,531 --> 00:10:42,660
And one of the first people
actually find fossils.

326
00:10:43,020 --> 00:10:47,580
She discovered the [inaudible] Mary
Anning was the girl from the rhyme.

327
00:10:47,790 --> 00:10:52,620
She sells seashells on the seashore
cause that's what she did as a child.

328
00:10:53,190 --> 00:10:54,960
And as she was looking for seashells,

329
00:10:55,290 --> 00:10:59,460
she found a skeleton of an
atheist sore buried and a cliff.

330
00:10:59,940 --> 00:11:00,773
Oh yeah.

331
00:11:00,950 --> 00:11:01,860
As like a kid.

332
00:11:01,861 --> 00:11:02,820
I think she was 12,

333
00:11:02,821 --> 00:11:04,350
13 of Holy Shit.

334
00:11:04,351 --> 00:11:05,430
I think paleontology,

335
00:11:05,431 --> 00:11:07,740
Twitter is going to rip me
apart for not knowing the thing,

336
00:11:07,741 --> 00:11:08,281
but come on,

337
00:11:08,281 --> 00:11:08,491
I'm,

338
00:11:08,491 --> 00:11:09,330
I'm hyped up now.

339
00:11:09,750 --> 00:11:10,600
I'm drunk.

340
00:11:10,610 --> 00:11:11,443
He's hyped up.

341
00:11:11,580 --> 00:11:12,211
I'm not dude,

342
00:11:12,211 --> 00:11:13,044
that's one beer.

343
00:11:13,100 --> 00:11:13,470
All right.

344
00:11:13,470 --> 00:11:15,320
I've got it.

345
00:11:15,321 --> 00:11:16,170
Had before you got here.

346
00:11:16,230 --> 00:11:16,950
None.

347
00:11:16,950 --> 00:11:17,551
We got excited.

348
00:11:17,551 --> 00:11:18,510
I've got nine more in there.

349
00:11:18,900 --> 00:11:19,733
Um,

350
00:11:19,940 --> 00:11:20,773
I'm going to need them.

351
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:22,170
Uh,

352
00:11:22,170 --> 00:11:22,531
yeah,

353
00:11:22,531 --> 00:11:26,310
it's just so Marianne and discovered
a [inaudible] and once you discover

354
00:11:26,311 --> 00:11:27,144
something like that,

355
00:11:27,300 --> 00:11:28,860
you want to go around the world and say,

356
00:11:28,950 --> 00:11:29,400
Hey,

357
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:30,630
where else is this stuff?

358
00:11:30,780 --> 00:11:32,910
Let's go somewhere that no one has been,

359
00:11:33,750 --> 00:11:35,310
which means North America,

360
00:11:35,311 --> 00:11:36,061
South America,

361
00:11:36,061 --> 00:11:40,320
Tanzania believes all the things that
Captain Jack Ass just rattled off.

362
00:11:40,350 --> 00:11:41,160
Captain Fuckface.

363
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:42,520
So Tom kept kept my face.

364
00:11:43,250 --> 00:11:44,460
God fucking fuck.

365
00:11:44,461 --> 00:11:45,420
What did shit given?

366
00:11:45,450 --> 00:11:46,283
I don't know.

367
00:11:46,290 --> 00:11:47,160
Just something.

368
00:11:47,390 --> 00:11:47,760
Yeah,

369
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:48,270
I stole.

370
00:11:48,270 --> 00:11:50,370
I stole shit given from a Trump thing,

371
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:53,680
but Gibbons shit given like a monkey,

372
00:11:53,681 --> 00:11:55,450
like a gibbon monkey ape.

373
00:11:55,630 --> 00:11:56,800
I think they're technically apes.

374
00:11:57,070 --> 00:11:57,820
Gibbons are eight.

375
00:11:57,820 --> 00:11:58,750
I think Gibbons are raped.

376
00:11:58,800 --> 00:11:59,260
Hmm.

377
00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:00,093
They have tails.

378
00:12:00,580 --> 00:12:02,570
No Art.

379
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:03,950
All Apes.

380
00:12:03,951 --> 00:12:04,790
Monkeys.

381
00:12:04,850 --> 00:12:06,590
But not all monkeys or apes.

382
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:07,491
No.

383
00:12:07,491 --> 00:12:08,510
Apes and monkeys are prime.

384
00:12:08,511 --> 00:12:09,680
But a monkey is just,

385
00:12:09,681 --> 00:12:11,090
it's not a technical term.

386
00:12:11,091 --> 00:12:11,241
Right?

387
00:12:11,241 --> 00:12:12,470
It's not a scientific term.

388
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:16,130
There was an article that was written
there was explaining that all apes or

389
00:12:16,131 --> 00:12:16,641
monkeys,

390
00:12:16,641 --> 00:12:18,350
but not all monkeys or apes.

391
00:12:18,530 --> 00:12:19,363
See if you can find that.

392
00:12:19,380 --> 00:12:19,930
Well,

393
00:12:19,930 --> 00:12:23,240
we'll go to that afterwards probably
because like one of those beers.

394
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:24,170
Okay,

395
00:12:24,170 --> 00:12:24,591
let's,

396
00:12:24,591 --> 00:12:25,580
let's keep this rolling.

397
00:12:25,780 --> 00:12:26,210
I don't want to,

398
00:12:26,210 --> 00:12:29,450
I want to see how deep we can
go with this bake character.

399
00:12:29,570 --> 00:12:33,650
I don't know what kind of explored
for thousands for this time.

400
00:12:34,190 --> 00:12:36,260
No one ever found a
dinosaur fossil before.

401
00:12:36,860 --> 00:12:37,760
According to the book,

402
00:12:37,910 --> 00:12:39,140
the dinosaur project,

403
00:12:39,350 --> 00:12:41,090
paleontological journalists,

404
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:42,020
Wayne Grady,

405
00:12:42,210 --> 00:12:47,210
cause the period following this from
around 1870 to 1880 became a period in

406
00:12:48,441 --> 00:12:53,240
North America where some of the most
underhanded shenanigans in the history of

407
00:12:53,241 --> 00:12:54,740
science were conducted.

408
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:59,720
That's because of the two paleontologists
going at it against each other going,

409
00:12:59,910 --> 00:13:01,070
I can find the cooler thing.

410
00:13:01,071 --> 00:13:01,281
No,

411
00:13:01,281 --> 00:13:02,450
I can find the cooler thing.

412
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:04,040
I'm going to find more shit than you.

413
00:13:04,220 --> 00:13:05,510
It was called the bone wars.

414
00:13:05,540 --> 00:13:06,740
Ogden versus marsh.

415
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:07,730
You already talked about this,

416
00:13:07,731 --> 00:13:07,980
right?

417
00:13:07,980 --> 00:13:08,470
Yeah.

418
00:13:08,470 --> 00:13:08,900
What was,

419
00:13:08,900 --> 00:13:10,100
what was underhanded about it?

420
00:13:10,310 --> 00:13:11,143
They would,

421
00:13:11,170 --> 00:13:11,480
uh,

422
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:12,120
they would,

423
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:12,953
uh,

424
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:13,793
uh,

425
00:13:14,260 --> 00:13:14,780
um,

426
00:13:14,780 --> 00:13:16,790
sabotage each other's digs.

427
00:13:16,940 --> 00:13:19,100
They would try and steal fossils.

428
00:13:19,101 --> 00:13:20,300
They were assholes.

429
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:23,150
But because of the competition,

430
00:13:23,540 --> 00:13:27,530
it's like a fight when
you have one dude that,

431
00:13:27,540 --> 00:13:27,860
you know,

432
00:13:27,860 --> 00:13:30,920
two dudes had been training all their
lives and trying to do the whole thing.

433
00:13:31,250 --> 00:13:32,540
The more amped up one gets,

434
00:13:32,541 --> 00:13:33,650
the more amped up the others gate.

435
00:13:33,670 --> 00:13:34,503
It's going to be a fucking,

436
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:35,353
just throw down.

437
00:13:35,450 --> 00:13:38,810
This is what happened on an
intellectual and fieldwork scale.

438
00:13:39,260 --> 00:13:43,400
You had two guys trying to make a name
for themselves in a burgeoning brand new

439
00:13:43,401 --> 00:13:48,401
field that just wanted to get in and
roll and they had direct competition with

440
00:13:49,611 --> 00:13:49,971
each other.

441
00:13:49,971 --> 00:13:50,804
So it's going to be,

442
00:13:51,020 --> 00:13:51,440
you know,

443
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:51,981
fuck you.

444
00:13:51,981 --> 00:13:53,360
I'm going to find these bones first.

445
00:13:53,810 --> 00:13:54,390
And it,

446
00:13:54,390 --> 00:13:55,760
it got nasty man.

447
00:13:55,970 --> 00:13:56,570
Wow.

448
00:13:56,570 --> 00:13:56,900
Yeah.

449
00:13:56,900 --> 00:13:57,680
It's like,

450
00:13:57,680 --> 00:14:01,130
think of it as Edison
versus Tesla's paleontology,

451
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:02,033
right?

452
00:14:02,690 --> 00:14:04,310
Except Tesla wasn't very aggressive.

453
00:14:04,311 --> 00:14:05,630
He sort of like let all that shit

454
00:14:06,050 --> 00:14:06,500
true.

455
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:07,333
True,

456
00:14:07,930 --> 00:14:08,763
very true.

457
00:14:08,820 --> 00:14:13,820
Keep keep this going on as the great
dinosaur rash or the bone wars.

458
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:19,720
Edward Drinker Co of the academy off of
the Peabody Museum of natural history

459
00:14:22,190 --> 00:14:26,000
began a lifelong rivalry and
passion for a dinosaur hunting.

460
00:14:26,001 --> 00:14:27,850
I said on my bad,

461
00:14:27,851 --> 00:14:32,660
but became bitter enemies during the
legendary feud involving double crossing

462
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:33,640
slander,

463
00:14:33,710 --> 00:14:34,543
bribery,

464
00:14:34,550 --> 00:14:35,240
theft,

465
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:38,600
spying and destruction
of bones by both parties.

466
00:14:38,930 --> 00:14:43,930
Marsh is said to have discovered over 500
different ancient species including 80

467
00:14:44,661 --> 00:14:49,661
dinosaurs while cope discovered 56 out
of the hundred and 36 dinosaur species

468
00:14:50,810 --> 00:14:52,880
supposedly discovered by the two men.

469
00:14:52,910 --> 00:14:53,743
However,

470
00:14:53,770 --> 00:14:58,610
close with 32 are presently considered
valid as the rest of all proven to be

471
00:14:58,611 --> 00:15:00,800
falsifications and fabrications.

472
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:03,710
Bullshit Bull Shit,

473
00:15:04,130 --> 00:15:06,290
not a falsifications or fabrication.

474
00:15:06,410 --> 00:15:08,000
Turns out a lot of those dinosaurs.

475
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:10,700
We're the same species that
were previously discovered,

476
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:12,980
so oh look,

477
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:15,500
this sauropod femur looks a lot like that.

478
00:15:15,501 --> 00:15:16,251
Sauropod Femur,

479
00:15:16,251 --> 00:15:18,500
but I found this slightly
in a different place,

480
00:15:18,501 --> 00:15:20,360
so I'm going to name it a new species.

481
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:21,230
Nope.

482
00:15:21,230 --> 00:15:24,980
Turns out those are both Brontosaurus
or a pat disorders or triceratops or

483
00:15:25,010 --> 00:15:25,671
stegosaurs,

484
00:15:25,671 --> 00:15:26,504
anything like that.

485
00:15:26,780 --> 00:15:27,500
Um,

486
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:27,861
that,

487
00:15:27,861 --> 00:15:28,161
that,

488
00:15:28,161 --> 00:15:31,280
that is just an outright
fucking lie that he just said.

489
00:15:32,540 --> 00:15:34,280
When things are discovered,

490
00:15:34,281 --> 00:15:36,710
it turns out that they're the same.

491
00:15:37,010 --> 00:15:39,950
It becomes taxonomically
what's called a junior synonym.

492
00:15:40,550 --> 00:15:41,383
So,

493
00:15:41,780 --> 00:15:42,140
uh,

494
00:15:42,140 --> 00:15:42,950
for example,

495
00:15:42,950 --> 00:15:47,330
tyrannosaurus rex had another
name for a really long time.

496
00:15:47,331 --> 00:15:48,710
It's totally mega,

497
00:15:48,740 --> 00:15:49,310
mega,

498
00:15:49,310 --> 00:15:50,540
no one,

499
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:51,433
regardless,

500
00:15:51,530 --> 00:15:53,600
whatever the first name for it was,

501
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:57,050
was technically the first
discovered name for it.

502
00:15:57,260 --> 00:16:00,530
But since tyrannosaurus rex
became the more popular,

503
00:16:00,531 --> 00:16:01,350
the more documented,

504
00:16:01,350 --> 00:16:04,430
the more thing that became
a junior synonym or what,

505
00:16:04,431 --> 00:16:07,670
or in that one actually became
what we call no mum obscure him.

506
00:16:07,671 --> 00:16:09,320
There were the obscure name no longer,

507
00:16:09,350 --> 00:16:10,183
uh,

508
00:16:10,460 --> 00:16:11,510
no longer talked about.

509
00:16:11,990 --> 00:16:13,610
But that's what happened.

510
00:16:13,611 --> 00:16:15,380
It wasn't an outright fabrication.

511
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:20,300
It was two dudes finding bones of
the same species or type of animal,

512
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:24,170
but not naming it the same thing.

513
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:24,710
So that's,

514
00:16:24,710 --> 00:16:26,840
that's an absolute bullshit.

515
00:16:26,870 --> 00:16:28,130
Eric Dubay outright lie

516
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:32,590
of them once claimed to find
a complete skeleton either.

517
00:16:32,740 --> 00:16:35,380
So all their work
involved reconstructions,

518
00:16:35,740 --> 00:16:36,550
in fact,

519
00:16:36,550 --> 00:16:37,390
to this day,

520
00:16:37,630 --> 00:16:40,360
no complete skeleton has ever been found.

521
00:16:40,610 --> 00:16:42,880
And so all dinosaurs are reconstruction.

522
00:16:43,070 --> 00:16:43,160
Well,

523
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:43,993
Shit.

524
00:16:44,330 --> 00:16:44,780
Uh,

525
00:16:44,780 --> 00:16:47,210
Su in the field museum is,

526
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:47,720
well,

527
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:48,950
not a hundred percent complete,

528
00:16:48,951 --> 00:16:50,630
98% complete,

529
00:16:50,810 --> 00:16:54,810
including formerly unknown
elements from any other train.

530
00:16:54,820 --> 00:16:55,653
Assor.

531
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:56,810
Um,

532
00:16:56,810 --> 00:16:57,800
I believe,

533
00:16:57,830 --> 00:16:58,231
uh,

534
00:16:58,231 --> 00:17:03,231
a commercial paleontology group just
found like a 99% or almost all 100%

535
00:17:03,471 --> 00:17:04,304
complete dinosaur.

536
00:17:04,490 --> 00:17:09,380
We have found entireties or
near entireties of animals.

537
00:17:09,410 --> 00:17:13,340
So He's right by a very small
technicality of one or 2%.

538
00:17:13,370 --> 00:17:14,070
Exactly.

539
00:17:14,070 --> 00:17:14,670
Exactly.

540
00:17:14,670 --> 00:17:17,660
But what he's implying
is completely misleading.

541
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:21,560
He's implying that they're finding a
shin bone and drawing and a dinosaur

542
00:17:21,561 --> 00:17:22,280
around.

543
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:22,881
Exactly.

544
00:17:22,881 --> 00:17:23,391
But no,

545
00:17:23,391 --> 00:17:23,841
like we,

546
00:17:23,841 --> 00:17:24,740
we'll find,

547
00:17:25,070 --> 00:17:26,720
we can find 70% of a train.

548
00:17:26,721 --> 00:17:27,291
This horse wrecks.

549
00:17:27,291 --> 00:17:28,370
We know what they look like.

550
00:17:28,371 --> 00:17:29,090
So yeah,

551
00:17:29,090 --> 00:17:33,170
we will use three d printing
or casting of all that many.

552
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:33,890
And Yeah,

553
00:17:33,890 --> 00:17:36,620
I'm happily admitting this
because everyone knows,

554
00:17:36,621 --> 00:17:37,910
or at least everyone should know,

555
00:17:38,510 --> 00:17:43,510
many dinosaurs in museums are
what we call conglomerates.

556
00:17:44,150 --> 00:17:44,983
It will be,

557
00:17:45,050 --> 00:17:45,340
uh,

558
00:17:45,340 --> 00:17:46,970
see a triceratops.

559
00:17:47,420 --> 00:17:48,800
The skull will be real.

560
00:17:48,830 --> 00:17:50,550
Maybe the front half of the animals,

561
00:17:50,551 --> 00:17:51,151
some ribs,

562
00:17:51,151 --> 00:17:54,990
maybe some tail vertebrae or the
pelvis will be from one animal.

563
00:17:55,950 --> 00:18:00,950
We will have to use casts of other
triceratops that we have throughout

564
00:18:01,711 --> 00:18:03,870
paleontology in other museums.

565
00:18:04,140 --> 00:18:06,210
Many of the fossils you see on display,

566
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:11,480
our casts now cast doesn't mean
bullshit created on the spot.

567
00:18:11,670 --> 00:18:13,890
It means very technically,

568
00:18:14,190 --> 00:18:19,190
this is a cast that is a replica of an
actual existing bone that was wrapped,

569
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:20,700
made a mold of,

570
00:18:20,820 --> 00:18:22,350
and then filled with resin,

571
00:18:22,530 --> 00:18:23,880
painted to the correct color.

572
00:18:24,090 --> 00:18:28,110
It is the exact match
of a bone that exists.

573
00:18:28,770 --> 00:18:31,080
It is not something we are just making up.

574
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:35,790
That is bullshit and I hate
that when they come in and go,

575
00:18:35,820 --> 00:18:36,511
oh look,

576
00:18:36,511 --> 00:18:38,610
that's link plastic.

577
00:18:38,611 --> 00:18:38,910
Yeah,

578
00:18:38,910 --> 00:18:39,910
it's plants and it gets all like,

579
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:40,111
well,

580
00:18:40,111 --> 00:18:40,441
yeah,

581
00:18:40,441 --> 00:18:42,750
you know why fossils are fucking fragile.

582
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:48,440
It takes us weeks to get a single bone
out and then it is covered in glue.

583
00:18:48,571 --> 00:18:50,280
It is wrapped in tissue paper.

584
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:51,660
Sometimes tin foil,

585
00:18:52,020 --> 00:18:54,900
a shit ton of plaster and
reinforcement is wrapped around it.

586
00:18:55,110 --> 00:18:59,910
Then it has to be very carefully slid
down a mountain on a car hood in one time

587
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:04,860
or airlifted out in another and put in
the back of trucks and then take an all

588
00:19:04,861 --> 00:19:07,920
the way to its museum and then cracked
open and then PR and then prepared

589
00:19:08,250 --> 00:19:09,083
everything has to get,

590
00:19:09,180 --> 00:19:09,600
uh,

591
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:13,530
get lift off it very carefully and we're
adding more glue as we're going because

592
00:19:13,531 --> 00:19:16,110
if you sneeze wrong on some,

593
00:19:16,550 --> 00:19:16,860
uh,

594
00:19:16,860 --> 00:19:17,640
on some,

595
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:18,000
uh,

596
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,080
mineralized specimens,

597
00:19:19,260 --> 00:19:20,340
it goes away.

598
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:22,410
It just goes boom.

599
00:19:23,490 --> 00:19:27,720
So you have to work very carefully in
a booth with like an error Brater so

600
00:19:27,721 --> 00:19:28,141
you're just,

601
00:19:28,141 --> 00:19:32,820
you're shooting extremely fine particles
just to get the top millimeter of

602
00:19:32,821 --> 00:19:33,654
material off.

603
00:19:34,560 --> 00:19:39,560
This is hard detailed work on things that
are 65 plus million years old that if

604
00:19:41,041 --> 00:19:41,874
we're not careful,

605
00:19:41,970 --> 00:19:43,410
they fall apart.

606
00:19:43,750 --> 00:19:48,750
We are not going to wrap something like
that in fucking steal and put it up on a

607
00:19:48,961 --> 00:19:49,470
mount,

608
00:19:49,470 --> 00:19:50,303
especially somewhere,

609
00:19:50,310 --> 00:19:53,010
I dunno like Los Angeles where
things like earthquakes happen.

610
00:19:54,150 --> 00:19:59,150
It's statements like that that he
makes are just fucking irritating.

611
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:00,781
Keep it,

612
00:20:00,781 --> 00:20:01,291
keep it going.

613
00:20:01,291 --> 00:20:02,124
The last thing he wrote,

614
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:04,170
discoveries and excavations.

615
00:20:04,171 --> 00:20:07,710
The same not to be made by
disinterested people such as farmers,

616
00:20:07,711 --> 00:20:08,311
ranchers,

617
00:20:08,311 --> 00:20:08,851
hikers,

618
00:20:08,851 --> 00:20:09,570
bullshit,

619
00:20:09,570 --> 00:20:10,230
bullshit,

620
00:20:10,230 --> 00:20:10,741
bullshit.

621
00:20:10,741 --> 00:20:15,060
Building constructional issues they
face is a fucking lutely bullshit.

622
00:20:15,150 --> 00:20:16,170
Fuck you Eric.

623
00:20:16,260 --> 00:20:17,490
I'm a Paleo Monitor.

624
00:20:17,491 --> 00:20:18,360
You asshole.

625
00:20:18,630 --> 00:20:22,470
I am actually contracted to go out to
fucking building sites and make sure

626
00:20:22,471 --> 00:20:25,800
fossils are protected
and dug up correctly.

627
00:20:25,890 --> 00:20:26,670
In fact,

628
00:20:26,670 --> 00:20:27,840
you know what Jack Ass,

629
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:30,600
I found a whale in downtown La.

630
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:31,021
Fuck you Eric.

631
00:20:31,021 --> 00:20:31,650
Do Bay.

632
00:20:31,650 --> 00:20:32,430
He found a whale.

633
00:20:32,430 --> 00:20:33,960
I found a way only downtown away.

634
00:20:33,990 --> 00:20:34,111
Oh,

635
00:20:34,111 --> 00:20:36,610
you talked about this last podcast
you were talking about how to,

636
00:20:36,670 --> 00:20:38,010
they had a shutdown construction.

637
00:20:38,011 --> 00:20:38,844
Exactly.

638
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:39,540
You know why?

639
00:20:39,540 --> 00:20:43,470
Cause building construction finds fucking
dinosaurs and Ma and whales and pre

640
00:20:43,471 --> 00:20:44,101
stork animals.

641
00:20:44,101 --> 00:20:44,970
You Jack Ass.

642
00:20:45,810 --> 00:20:46,380
Ah,

643
00:20:46,380 --> 00:20:46,900
fuck.

644
00:20:46,900 --> 00:20:49,390
Fuck you farmers.

645
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:50,433
So,

646
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:51,760
uh,

647
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:54,430
sue was found on a guy's farm.

648
00:20:54,700 --> 00:20:56,740
There have been numerous dinosaurs,

649
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:59,080
numerous prehistoric animals
found on a guy's farm.

650
00:20:59,230 --> 00:20:59,771
By the way,

651
00:20:59,771 --> 00:21:03,970
there's an entire private
area up in Bakersfield called
shark's tooth hill where

652
00:21:03,971 --> 00:21:04,930
they find meg teeth.

653
00:21:04,931 --> 00:21:06,730
Miguel on onto all the fucking time.

654
00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:08,470
It's honors field in Bakersfield.

655
00:21:08,471 --> 00:21:11,890
It's on private land farmers builders.

656
00:21:12,190 --> 00:21:13,510
Recreational people.

657
00:21:13,540 --> 00:21:13,751
Yeah.

658
00:21:13,751 --> 00:21:13,991
Hey,

659
00:21:13,991 --> 00:21:14,501
guess what?

660
00:21:14,501 --> 00:21:19,330
A couple people hiking in Red Rock Canyon
up near Palmdale found a trackway from

661
00:21:19,331 --> 00:21:21,400
an ancient camel rec.

662
00:21:21,420 --> 00:21:23,350
We recreational people.

663
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:23,950
Yeah.

664
00:21:23,950 --> 00:21:25,810
This happens all the fucking time.

665
00:21:26,470 --> 00:21:30,100
The reason why it's happening more and
more lately it's because people know what

666
00:21:30,101 --> 00:21:31,090
they're looking for now.

667
00:21:31,420 --> 00:21:32,140
They understand.

668
00:21:32,140 --> 00:21:32,650
Wow,

669
00:21:32,650 --> 00:21:33,850
there could be shit out here.

670
00:21:34,120 --> 00:21:34,421
Hey,

671
00:21:34,421 --> 00:21:35,470
if we're digging a road,

672
00:21:35,471 --> 00:21:37,780
if we're widening the
99 freeway in Fresno,

673
00:21:38,170 --> 00:21:38,831
Holy Shit,

674
00:21:38,831 --> 00:21:42,070
we hit a mammoth or holy shit,

675
00:21:42,130 --> 00:21:47,130
we found a whale in downtown la like
with within blocks of the one 10 freeway

676
00:21:48,161 --> 00:21:49,150
and good Samaritan Hospital.

677
00:21:49,450 --> 00:21:50,650
I won't tell you where I can't,

678
00:21:50,980 --> 00:21:51,880
but yeah,

679
00:21:52,110 --> 00:21:52,960
I just wanted to secrecy.

680
00:21:53,380 --> 00:21:53,800
Yeah.

681
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:56,200
It's just part of the part
of the contracts that's,

682
00:21:56,201 --> 00:21:56,711
that's the deal.

683
00:21:56,711 --> 00:21:58,510
Because if you find something,

684
00:21:58,810 --> 00:21:59,770
if you find something there,

685
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:00,760
you can find more shit.

686
00:22:01,180 --> 00:22:05,360
We found over 400 specimens
of shark teeth whale's,

687
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:05,880
uh,

688
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:07,480
or a rib cage of a whale,

689
00:22:07,570 --> 00:22:08,200
snails,

690
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:09,040
fossil coral,

691
00:22:09,190 --> 00:22:14,190
all of this because downtown La was
underwater 7 million years ago and yeah,

692
00:22:15,191 --> 00:22:15,430
that's,

693
00:22:15,430 --> 00:22:16,001
Oh my God,

694
00:22:16,001 --> 00:22:17,260
that's fucking bullshit.

695
00:22:17,890 --> 00:22:18,280
Ah,

696
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:18,621
keep going.

697
00:22:18,621 --> 00:22:18,760
Yeah.

698
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:23,760
Blind trench digger and mining industry
personnel found all the time by people

699
00:22:23,921 --> 00:22:27,940
with a vested interest such
as paleontologists scientists,

700
00:22:28,090 --> 00:22:29,440
university professors,

701
00:22:29,620 --> 00:22:33,710
and museum organization personnel
who meaning trained motherfuckers,

702
00:22:33,730 --> 00:22:34,660
dinosaur bones,

703
00:22:34,810 --> 00:22:37,150
or who have studied dinosaurs previously.

704
00:22:37,450 --> 00:22:42,400
Fines are often made during
special dinosaur bone
hunting trips and expeditions

705
00:22:42,401 --> 00:22:46,690
by these people to far away regions
already inhabited and explored.

706
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:48,910
This seems highly implausible.

707
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:53,680
More believable is the case of the
discovery of the first original Dead Sea

708
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:58,330
Scrolls in 1947 which were unintentionally
discovered by a child and which were

709
00:22:58,331 --> 00:23:00,310
all published by 1955

710
00:23:00,420 --> 00:23:01,110
Oh,

711
00:23:01,110 --> 00:23:01,980
okay.

712
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:07,040
So it's perfectly fine to accidentally
find ancient scrolls or silver dinero AI

713
00:23:08,671 --> 00:23:13,671
from the Roman period or a never
before known pyramid and South America.

714
00:23:14,730 --> 00:23:15,091
Oh no,

715
00:23:15,091 --> 00:23:15,721
that's cool.

716
00:23:15,721 --> 00:23:16,201
You know why?

717
00:23:16,201 --> 00:23:17,970
Because humans fucking made those.

718
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:21,840
But it's completely out
of the norm for some kid,

719
00:23:21,870 --> 00:23:26,870
some nine year old kid to be walking
around Montana and find a mummified

720
00:23:26,970 --> 00:23:30,870
Hadrosaur because I don't know
why I made that distinction.

721
00:23:30,871 --> 00:23:32,490
That's it were weird comparison.

722
00:23:32,491 --> 00:23:32,650
There's,

723
00:23:32,650 --> 00:23:33,270
yeah,

724
00:23:33,270 --> 00:23:37,080
it's more plausible the find the Dead Sea
Scrolls in Qumran than it is to find a

725
00:23:37,081 --> 00:23:39,050
megalodon tooth bullshit.

726
00:23:39,060 --> 00:23:39,881
Bakersfield's yeah,

727
00:23:39,881 --> 00:23:40,690
that doesn't make any sense.

728
00:23:40,690 --> 00:23:40,900
No,

729
00:23:40,900 --> 00:23:41,140
no.

730
00:23:41,140 --> 00:23:42,270
It doesn't make any sense.

731
00:23:42,271 --> 00:23:42,631
He's,

732
00:23:42,631 --> 00:23:45,980
he's anthropomorphise sizing
this and he's using a very,

733
00:23:45,990 --> 00:23:50,930
an absolutely invalid invalid argument
and a logical fallacies trying.

734
00:23:51,350 --> 00:23:52,220
He's trying to,

735
00:23:52,250 --> 00:23:53,990
its absolute false equivocation.

736
00:23:54,260 --> 00:23:54,921
He's trying to go,

737
00:23:54,921 --> 00:23:55,131
oh,

738
00:23:55,131 --> 00:23:55,490
well,

739
00:23:55,490 --> 00:23:55,761
you know,

740
00:23:55,761 --> 00:23:57,680
you can't find this
stuff because it's super,

741
00:23:57,681 --> 00:23:58,221
super old,

742
00:23:58,221 --> 00:24:01,640
but you can find this stuff because it's
younger and it's humans and you know,

743
00:24:01,641 --> 00:24:02,421
people live there.

744
00:24:02,421 --> 00:24:03,860
So we'd expect stuff there.

745
00:24:04,160 --> 00:24:04,821
Well guess what,

746
00:24:04,821 --> 00:24:05,654
asshole?

747
00:24:05,690 --> 00:24:10,690
There's 65 million years of difference
between humans deciding to write shit

748
00:24:13,341 --> 00:24:14,750
down and go,

749
00:24:14,870 --> 00:24:15,703
hey,

750
00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:16,580
uh,

751
00:24:16,580 --> 00:24:17,630
there's a day and a night.

752
00:24:17,660 --> 00:24:19,520
That means something's
ruling the day in the night.

753
00:24:19,521 --> 00:24:22,430
God's religion and industry and all that,

754
00:24:22,460 --> 00:24:27,460
and dinosaurs eating
shit 65 million years.

755
00:24:28,820 --> 00:24:29,570
You,

756
00:24:29,570 --> 00:24:31,730
we were tree shrews and moles.

757
00:24:31,850 --> 00:24:32,683
We didn't,

758
00:24:32,840 --> 00:24:34,160
we weren't building shit.

759
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:35,870
We weren't writing stuff down.

760
00:24:37,340 --> 00:24:39,200
Such a false fucking argument.

761
00:24:39,530 --> 00:24:39,771
God,

762
00:24:39,771 --> 00:24:40,160
this guy said,

763
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:40,610
check.

764
00:24:40,610 --> 00:24:44,760
So some cases of a discovery of dinosaur
bones by a disinterested person.

765
00:24:44,970 --> 00:24:49,350
It was suggested to them by some
professional in the field [inaudible] in a

766
00:24:49,351 --> 00:24:50,140
certain area.

767
00:24:50,140 --> 00:24:54,450
It wasn't also very interesting to
note our special areas set aside and

768
00:24:54,451 --> 00:24:58,240
designated as dinosaur parks
because we found a judging short.

769
00:24:58,250 --> 00:25:02,550
Hector's are required to first
obtain a dinosaur hunting license,

770
00:25:02,970 --> 00:25:07,590
whatever destination these establishment
finance national's hard paleontologists

771
00:25:07,591 --> 00:25:08,280
set,

772
00:25:08,280 --> 00:25:08,860
it seemed,

773
00:25:08,860 --> 00:25:12,150
they found incredible numbers
of fossils and tiny areas.

774
00:25:12,510 --> 00:25:17,510
In one of the largest dinosaur excavation
sites called the Ruth Mason Corey,

775
00:25:18,570 --> 00:25:21,690
over 2000 fossils were
allegedly discovered.

776
00:25:22,050 --> 00:25:22,711
Stop saying,

777
00:25:22,711 --> 00:25:27,711
fuck legend skeleton assembled from these
bones are currently on display in over

778
00:25:27,811 --> 00:25:32,811
60 museums worldwide because dino head
of paleontology at Laplata museum is

779
00:25:35,191 --> 00:25:40,191
amazingly responsible for 6,000 fossil
species supposedly discovered throughout

780
00:25:40,711 --> 00:25:45,000
his career all in Argentina or oh really?

781
00:25:45,030 --> 00:25:45,540
Really?

782
00:25:45,540 --> 00:25:45,721
Hey,

783
00:25:45,721 --> 00:25:46,650
guess what Eric?

784
00:25:47,610 --> 00:25:52,610
I ran a lab that we had three and a half
million specimens from the ice age that

785
00:25:53,791 --> 00:25:55,740
goes back 90,000 years.

786
00:25:56,190 --> 00:25:57,960
So the libray a tarpits,

787
00:25:58,020 --> 00:26:03,020
the largest ice age mammal collection on
the fucking planet and this stuff isn't

788
00:26:04,081 --> 00:26:04,914
mineralized.

789
00:26:05,190 --> 00:26:09,100
It's actually subsumed
with asphalt keeping the,

790
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:09,630
uh,

791
00:26:09,630 --> 00:26:11,240
all of the calcium and everything intact.

792
00:26:11,250 --> 00:26:12,150
These are actual bones.

793
00:26:12,151 --> 00:26:13,800
When we find a saber tooth cat tooth,

794
00:26:14,130 --> 00:26:15,750
it's the physical tooth of the animal.

795
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:16,470
Ooh.

796
00:26:16,470 --> 00:26:19,230
Which is kind of freaky
to think about but,

797
00:26:19,260 --> 00:26:19,500
but,

798
00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:21,240
but seeing that it's like,

799
00:26:21,270 --> 00:26:21,750
yeah,

800
00:26:21,750 --> 00:26:23,640
we find a lot of shit in places.

801
00:26:23,641 --> 00:26:27,330
The river of death and Alberta d
when they're digging the pipeline,

802
00:26:27,630 --> 00:26:27,990
um,

803
00:26:27,990 --> 00:26:28,441
I dunno.

804
00:26:28,441 --> 00:26:29,670
Mammoth hot springs.

805
00:26:30,360 --> 00:26:35,360
There are things called death traps and
Predator traps in sinkholes and natural

806
00:26:36,421 --> 00:26:39,060
trap caves and I don't know,

807
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:42,180
entire sand dunes falling on things
while they're fighting the dueling

808
00:26:42,181 --> 00:26:42,751
dinosaurs.

809
00:26:42,751 --> 00:26:46,760
It's a air tops versus a velociraptor
that was found in Mongolia because of

810
00:26:46,761 --> 00:26:47,491
fucking sand.

811
00:26:47,491 --> 00:26:50,790
Dune fell on them while they were tussling
around cause the v Raptor wanted to

812
00:26:50,791 --> 00:26:52,670
eat the thing it that,

813
00:26:52,671 --> 00:26:52,851
that,

814
00:26:52,851 --> 00:26:54,210
that's a rad specimen by the way.

815
00:26:54,300 --> 00:26:58,950
You know what's interesting about this
guy is that he knows so much is that his,

816
00:26:58,980 --> 00:26:59,700
his,

817
00:26:59,700 --> 00:27:04,700
his knowledge of the history
of paleontology and of
researching dinosaur bones,

818
00:27:06,330 --> 00:27:08,730
he knows so much I call bullshit on that.

819
00:27:08,790 --> 00:27:11,640
What I'm thinking is that he's reading
from a script that he cobbled together on

820
00:27:11,641 --> 00:27:12,570
fucking Wikipedia.

821
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:15,840
I challenge him to go toe to toe
with somebody in the business.

822
00:27:15,900 --> 00:27:16,350
I don't know,

823
00:27:16,350 --> 00:27:18,240
like me and go,

824
00:27:18,270 --> 00:27:18,601
okay,

825
00:27:18,601 --> 00:27:19,421
start throwing date.

826
00:27:19,421 --> 00:27:20,550
Start throwing specimens.

827
00:27:20,820 --> 00:27:23,960
I will fucking own you be,

828
00:27:23,961 --> 00:27:24,511
you know what I'm saying?

829
00:27:24,511 --> 00:27:25,200
I mean he's,

830
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:25,951
he's obviously,

831
00:27:25,951 --> 00:27:27,060
he knows all these people.

832
00:27:27,061 --> 00:27:29,470
He knows about the bone
war as he knows well,

833
00:27:29,471 --> 00:27:34,230
who's in charge of all these different
simple Google search of largest dinosaur

834
00:27:34,231 --> 00:27:34,951
thing found.

835
00:27:34,951 --> 00:27:35,251
Okay,

836
00:27:35,251 --> 00:27:38,640
I'm going to write these three
things down on this Manila in Manila.

837
00:27:38,641 --> 00:27:38,911
Fucking,

838
00:27:38,911 --> 00:27:39,601
I understand that.

839
00:27:39,601 --> 00:27:40,470
I'm not saying that it's,

840
00:27:40,500 --> 00:27:43,290
it's impressive and that
it's conclusive evidence.

841
00:27:43,290 --> 00:27:44,070
I'm saying it's,

842
00:27:44,070 --> 00:27:48,270
it's impressive that this guy has done
this much research but yet still has this

843
00:27:48,271 --> 00:27:51,280
ridiculous idea and he's used to this.

844
00:27:51,670 --> 00:27:52,170
Yeah.

845
00:27:52,170 --> 00:27:57,170
He's using all this data that's actually
factual about how many different people

846
00:27:57,481 --> 00:28:01,920
found how many different things and
he's decided that this is proof and all

847
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:04,380
information allegedly in front of it.

848
00:28:04,500 --> 00:28:04,860
Yeah.

849
00:28:04,860 --> 00:28:05,101
It's like,

850
00:28:05,101 --> 00:28:05,311
no,

851
00:28:05,311 --> 00:28:05,970
sorry.

852
00:28:05,970 --> 00:28:07,830
Over 6,000 specimens were found there.

853
00:28:07,980 --> 00:28:08,820
Fucking go with it.

854
00:28:09,540 --> 00:28:10,373
Hunter.

855
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:15,440
Earl Douglas sent 350 tons of excavated
dinosaur bones to the Carnegie Museum of

856
00:28:18,450 --> 00:28:18,451
Natural History.

857
00:28:18,451 --> 00:28:19,590
Throughout his career,

858
00:28:19,770 --> 00:28:23,340
all coming from the Dinosaur
National Monument in Utah.

859
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:25,850
Why do you think it's called the
dinosaur national monument now,

860
00:28:26,300 --> 00:28:28,640
Dr. Lewis Chackbay and Dr Lowell,

861
00:28:28,740 --> 00:28:29,610
a key off bay,

862
00:28:29,670 --> 00:28:34,670
actually thousands of dinosaur eggs at a
site of only a few hundred square yard.

863
00:28:34,740 --> 00:28:36,540
It was called the
tiniest giant exhibition.

864
00:28:36,780 --> 00:28:41,640
How such fines have huge quantities of
fossils in one area by just a few highly

865
00:28:41,641 --> 00:28:42,900
invested individuals.

866
00:28:42,930 --> 00:28:47,930
It goes against the laws of natural
probability to the likelihood of forgeries

867
00:28:48,151 --> 00:28:50,520
or concentrated planting efforts wrong.

868
00:28:50,521 --> 00:28:52,450
If you find a fossil planting efforts,

869
00:28:52,980 --> 00:28:53,640
the plant,

870
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:55,080
what were the things that they planted?

871
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:55,550
They,

872
00:28:55,550 --> 00:28:57,420
there's dinosaur bones that they planted,

873
00:28:57,700 --> 00:29:01,500
that's the dinosaur bones
made out of like residency.

874
00:29:01,530 --> 00:29:04,170
So that is actually an
argument with these jackasses.

875
00:29:04,500 --> 00:29:04,950
It's like,

876
00:29:04,950 --> 00:29:05,281
okay,

877
00:29:05,281 --> 00:29:06,630
so big Paleo.

878
00:29:06,631 --> 00:29:07,710
The big paleontologist,

879
00:29:07,711 --> 00:29:10,200
people like me being Paleo,

880
00:29:10,201 --> 00:29:10,711
Paleo,

881
00:29:10,711 --> 00:29:11,544
big Pharma,

882
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:12,541
big Pharma,

883
00:29:12,541 --> 00:29:13,680
and big they,

884
00:29:13,700 --> 00:29:15,270
and you know all that podcast,

885
00:29:15,280 --> 00:29:16,113
Jamie.

886
00:29:16,380 --> 00:29:17,880
We're big podcasts where an industry,

887
00:29:18,930 --> 00:29:23,930
so they say they not in the black man,

888
00:29:24,211 --> 00:29:24,420
you know,

889
00:29:24,420 --> 00:29:25,290
black helicopter day,

890
00:29:25,291 --> 00:29:30,291
but they as in the detractors
state that paleontologists like me,

891
00:29:31,980 --> 00:29:33,660
we'll create a fossil,

892
00:29:34,020 --> 00:29:39,020
whether it's like a cast or we'll just
make one up and on these expeditions we

893
00:29:41,201 --> 00:29:46,201
go out and we actually bury it and
uncover it and make the news and all that.

894
00:29:47,080 --> 00:29:47,291
Well,

895
00:29:47,291 --> 00:29:48,400
if that was true,

896
00:29:48,460 --> 00:29:49,293
Eric,

897
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:53,800
why is it that when we
find something say in,

898
00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:54,850
I dunno,

899
00:29:54,850 --> 00:29:55,870
2008

900
00:29:57,150 --> 00:29:57,300
okay.

901
00:29:57,300 --> 00:30:02,300
It's not usually written about until
say 2012 and that's just a symbol,

902
00:30:03,540 --> 00:30:06,600
a single note in the Journal
of Vertebrate Paleontology,

903
00:30:06,601 --> 00:30:11,601
which I guarantee you've never read or
it's done as a poster at the Society of

904
00:30:12,540 --> 00:30:12,541
Vertebrate Paleontology,

905
00:30:12,541 --> 00:30:14,550
which I will absolutely
guarantee you've never been to.

906
00:30:15,750 --> 00:30:16,360
Yeah.

907
00:30:16,360 --> 00:30:18,730
And then the fossils still
in prep at that point,

908
00:30:18,850 --> 00:30:20,590
we haven't done all the research on it.

909
00:30:20,620 --> 00:30:22,720
It's still undiscovered fossil found.

910
00:30:23,140 --> 00:30:28,140
If we are going out and investing all of
this money in order to make these fakes

911
00:30:28,990 --> 00:30:33,990
and bury them and pay all of these people
to shut them up and huge excavations

912
00:30:34,540 --> 00:30:35,320
like that,

913
00:30:35,320 --> 00:30:39,550
we would kind of want to recoup that
money as fast as possible and immediately

914
00:30:39,551 --> 00:30:44,551
dump it to the news and get paid
for spokesman ships and all of that,

915
00:30:44,561 --> 00:30:45,460
but we don't.

916
00:30:45,820 --> 00:30:47,620
We suffer natural history.

917
00:30:47,621 --> 00:30:52,060
Museums are some of the lowest donated
two institutions on the planet.

918
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:54,250
Art Museums are generally number one.

919
00:30:55,750 --> 00:30:58,570
There are people that get laid
off all the time from museums,

920
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:00,280
museums close.

921
00:31:00,940 --> 00:31:04,390
If we were making all this
money and making all this fame,

922
00:31:04,830 --> 00:31:07,300
why are there
paleontologists out of a job?

923
00:31:07,540 --> 00:31:11,080
Why do I know a dozen monitors
that don't have work right now?

924
00:31:11,470 --> 00:31:16,470
Why are their museums that have problem
actually getting a budget to get an

925
00:31:16,691 --> 00:31:19,420
excavation going that they
have to use private donors,

926
00:31:19,421 --> 00:31:21,250
that they have to use
their board of directors,

927
00:31:21,430 --> 00:31:24,640
that they have to go from a
county museum to a foundation,

928
00:31:24,860 --> 00:31:27,730
nonprofit non profit.

929
00:31:29,370 --> 00:31:32,970
This is such a line of
fucking bullshit that,

930
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:37,260
I mean that that pisses me off because
his simple statements are looping in

931
00:31:37,530 --> 00:31:42,270
thousands and tens of thousands of
employees and museums and all of that

932
00:31:42,271 --> 00:31:43,260
worldwide.

933
00:31:43,890 --> 00:31:47,880
This would be one of the largest
conspiracies ever other than,

934
00:31:47,910 --> 00:31:48,330
I dunno.

935
00:31:48,330 --> 00:31:51,780
Moon hoax is a NASA earth flat
earth and shit other he does.

936
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:52,021
Yeah.

937
00:31:52,021 --> 00:31:52,854
That is the other one.

938
00:31:53,100 --> 00:31:53,933
Keep gone.

939
00:31:53,970 --> 00:31:54,540
Ah,

940
00:31:54,540 --> 00:31:55,373
let's get them one on one.

941
00:31:56,090 --> 00:31:59,270
Dinosaur bones sell for a
lot of money at auctions.

942
00:31:59,510 --> 00:32:00,950
It is a profitable business.

943
00:32:01,250 --> 00:32:03,890
There is pressure for
academics to publish papers.

944
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:07,850
Museums are in the business of
producing displays that are popular and

945
00:32:07,851 --> 00:32:08,330
appealing.

946
00:32:08,330 --> 00:32:12,680
What the nonprofit uselessness media need
to produce material to sell to stay in

947
00:32:12,681 --> 00:32:13,514
business.

948
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:18,320
The mainstream media loves to hype alleged
dinosaur fines much just to be gained

949
00:32:18,321 --> 00:32:23,321
by converting a bland non
dinosaur discovery of a bone
of modern origin into an

950
00:32:23,871 --> 00:32:25,070
impressive dinosaur.

951
00:32:25,071 --> 00:32:29,450
Find and letting artists interpretations
and imaginations take the spotlight.

952
00:32:29,490 --> 00:32:29,761
Okay.

953
00:32:29,761 --> 00:32:31,900
Rather than the basic boring real find.

954
00:32:32,050 --> 00:32:32,780
Um,

955
00:32:32,780 --> 00:32:33,010
if,

956
00:32:33,010 --> 00:32:34,170
if that's true,

957
00:32:35,240 --> 00:32:37,560
then why do dinosaurs become passe?

958
00:32:37,950 --> 00:32:40,460
Why does somebody like who has been on,

959
00:32:40,850 --> 00:32:41,420
I don't know,

960
00:32:41,420 --> 00:32:41,931
13,

961
00:32:41,931 --> 00:32:44,900
14 different television shows
talking about paleontology,

962
00:32:44,901 --> 00:32:45,860
geology and all that.

963
00:32:46,300 --> 00:32:48,620
I have pitched dinosaur,

964
00:32:48,650 --> 00:32:52,250
like live dig stuff to
BBC and all of that.

965
00:32:52,251 --> 00:32:54,590
I'm consulting on a
couple projects right now,

966
00:32:54,620 --> 00:32:55,041
unfortunately,

967
00:32:55,041 --> 00:32:55,874
can't name them,

968
00:32:56,030 --> 00:32:57,470
but uh,

969
00:32:57,530 --> 00:32:59,300
dinosaurs become passe very,

970
00:32:59,301 --> 00:33:00,830
very quickly because people are like,

971
00:33:00,950 --> 00:33:01,131
oh,

972
00:33:01,131 --> 00:33:01,341
cool.

973
00:33:01,341 --> 00:33:02,210
New dinosaurs found.

974
00:33:02,211 --> 00:33:02,331
Yeah.

975
00:33:02,331 --> 00:33:03,164
Big Deal.

976
00:33:03,380 --> 00:33:04,980
Or Oh well brontosauruses back.

977
00:33:04,981 --> 00:33:05,131
Yeah,

978
00:33:05,131 --> 00:33:05,964
whatever.

979
00:33:06,350 --> 00:33:08,670
But the mainstream media as he said,

980
00:33:09,560 --> 00:33:10,530
is just like,

981
00:33:10,550 --> 00:33:11,930
they love a dinosaur story,

982
00:33:11,960 --> 00:33:12,800
but that's bullshit.

983
00:33:12,920 --> 00:33:14,120
That's absolute bullshit.

984
00:33:14,150 --> 00:33:16,640
When was the women's the
last like dinosaur document?

985
00:33:16,850 --> 00:33:17,061
Yeah,

986
00:33:17,061 --> 00:33:17,894
there was um,

987
00:33:17,990 --> 00:33:18,860
uh,

988
00:33:19,100 --> 00:33:19,933
uh,

989
00:33:20,780 --> 00:33:21,471
what was it called?

990
00:33:21,471 --> 00:33:22,730
Autopsy of a t rex with,

991
00:33:22,760 --> 00:33:23,030
uh,

992
00:33:23,030 --> 00:33:25,190
my friend Tori and uh,

993
00:33:25,220 --> 00:33:26,053
that,

994
00:33:26,180 --> 00:33:26,571
that okay.

995
00:33:26,571 --> 00:33:27,790
That was a speculative science show.

996
00:33:27,791 --> 00:33:28,101
It was like,

997
00:33:28,101 --> 00:33:31,040
what happens if we found a t rex
and cut it open and do an autopsy?

998
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:37,000
That was a hit and then paleontology
TV died again two years ago.

999
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:39,200
I had a,

1000
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:43,250
to our national geographic documentary
about digging up wooly mammoths in that

1001
00:33:43,670 --> 00:33:45,020
it aired a night.

1002
00:33:45,380 --> 00:33:47,720
There was a little bit
of press fucking done.

1003
00:33:47,930 --> 00:33:49,820
The production company that did the,

1004
00:33:50,060 --> 00:33:50,540
the,

1005
00:33:50,540 --> 00:33:53,570
the thing with nat geo
is out of business now,

1006
00:33:53,870 --> 00:33:54,740
just done.

1007
00:33:55,190 --> 00:33:55,521
It's like,

1008
00:33:55,521 --> 00:33:56,210
really?

1009
00:33:56,210 --> 00:33:56,491
We're,

1010
00:33:56,491 --> 00:34:00,230
we're pressured and to get this money
then why aren't we making fucking more?

1011
00:34:00,470 --> 00:34:01,610
Why Eric,

1012
00:34:02,300 --> 00:34:07,300
am I a bartender in addition
to a paleontologist in
addition to somebody that's

1013
00:34:07,821 --> 00:34:08,690
on TV,

1014
00:34:09,470 --> 00:34:11,870
if I making all this big Pharma or sorry,

1015
00:34:11,871 --> 00:34:13,250
big Paleo fucking money.

1016
00:34:13,580 --> 00:34:14,930
If I'm such a shill.

1017
00:34:15,170 --> 00:34:15,740
Okay.

1018
00:34:15,740 --> 00:34:16,100
Yeah.

1019
00:34:16,100 --> 00:34:19,190
Is that why I'm a month behind
on my car payment right now?

1020
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:21,950
Is that why I'm trying
to scrape together rent?

1021
00:34:22,160 --> 00:34:22,761
Fuck.

1022
00:34:22,761 --> 00:34:25,460
You can aggressive.

1023
00:34:25,640 --> 00:34:25,851
Oh,

1024
00:34:25,851 --> 00:34:26,750
I'm very aggressive.

1025
00:34:26,751 --> 00:34:27,584
Fuck these guys.

1026
00:34:28,370 --> 00:34:29,330
Fame and attention.

1027
00:34:29,780 --> 00:34:34,360
There's the bandwagon effect and
crowd behavior and then their entity.

1028
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:34,730
Wait,

1029
00:34:34,730 --> 00:34:35,061
but wait,

1030
00:34:35,061 --> 00:34:35,211
wait,

1031
00:34:35,211 --> 00:34:35,361
wait,

1032
00:34:35,361 --> 00:34:35,960
wait,

1033
00:34:35,960 --> 00:34:36,231
wait.

1034
00:34:36,231 --> 00:34:41,060
The bandwagon effect and the crowd
behavior like flat earth bullshit.

1035
00:34:41,300 --> 00:34:42,133
Okay.

1036
00:34:42,830 --> 00:34:46,460
We're only seven minutes and 53
seconds into a 29 minute video.

1037
00:34:46,461 --> 00:34:47,300
Fuck all.

1038
00:34:49,550 --> 00:34:50,660
We don't have to keep going.

1039
00:34:50,690 --> 00:34:51,860
I don't want you to get too mad.

1040
00:34:51,861 --> 00:34:52,970
I think you kind of made your point.

1041
00:34:53,420 --> 00:34:54,980
You can pull the plug in anytime you want,

1042
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:58,280
but now it's like one of
those Twitter arguments.

1043
00:34:58,281 --> 00:34:58,491
Man.

1044
00:34:58,491 --> 00:34:59,900
Now I'm getting invested,

1045
00:35:02,540 --> 00:35:06,380
fucking troll me all the time
because we follow each other,

1046
00:35:06,381 --> 00:35:09,250
we DM each other and all
of a sudden in my thing,

1047
00:35:09,650 --> 00:35:12,590
it's like I have you on note
cause we're both verified,

1048
00:35:12,600 --> 00:35:16,130
it pops up and it's just like Joe
Rogan is tweeting about flat earth.

1049
00:35:16,131 --> 00:35:18,440
I'm like fuck.

1050
00:35:18,890 --> 00:35:19,790
And then just go for it.

1051
00:35:19,791 --> 00:35:20,624
It's like you're,

1052
00:35:21,500 --> 00:35:22,310
I mean like,

1053
00:35:22,310 --> 00:35:25,850
you know the podcast and like flight
commentary and UFC stuff and like with

1054
00:35:25,851 --> 00:35:26,031
your,

1055
00:35:26,031 --> 00:35:28,010
with like triggered
coming out and all that.

1056
00:35:28,190 --> 00:35:30,500
That's one thing when
you rile up the cranks,

1057
00:35:30,501 --> 00:35:31,334
man,

1058
00:35:31,910 --> 00:35:33,050
you're just like,

1059
00:35:33,051 --> 00:35:34,250
you're at the same level.

1060
00:35:34,330 --> 00:35:35,163
Just actually you have,

1061
00:35:35,390 --> 00:35:36,710
how many followers do you have?

1062
00:35:36,740 --> 00:35:37,680
Like 2 million,

1063
00:35:37,860 --> 00:35:38,191
right?

1064
00:35:38,191 --> 00:35:39,150
Does it like on Twitter?

1065
00:35:39,460 --> 00:35:40,280
Uh,

1066
00:35:40,280 --> 00:35:41,970
Tdt a take a Darwin.

1067
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:43,290
I like 10,

1068
00:35:43,291 --> 00:35:44,850
maybe 15,000.

1069
00:35:45,750 --> 00:35:48,720
I get the same level of
riled from both of you.

1070
00:35:49,620 --> 00:35:50,790
Fuck man.

1071
00:35:51,080 --> 00:35:53,520
So we need to fly him out
and have him on the show.

1072
00:35:53,550 --> 00:35:54,181
This guy,

1073
00:35:54,181 --> 00:35:54,550
this?

1074
00:35:54,550 --> 00:35:54,781
No,

1075
00:35:54,781 --> 00:35:54,961
no,

1076
00:35:54,961 --> 00:35:55,370
Eric.

1077
00:35:55,370 --> 00:35:55,491
No,

1078
00:35:55,491 --> 00:35:55,901
no,

1079
00:35:55,901 --> 00:35:56,130
no,

1080
00:35:56,130 --> 00:35:56,281
no.

1081
00:35:56,281 --> 00:35:57,120
Take that Darwin.

1082
00:35:57,130 --> 00:35:57,860
Yeah,

1083
00:35:57,860 --> 00:35:58,060
no,

1084
00:35:58,060 --> 00:35:58,160
he,

1085
00:35:58,160 --> 00:35:58,830
he'd be a fun,

1086
00:35:58,830 --> 00:35:59,600
he would be Rad.

1087
00:35:59,600 --> 00:35:59,810
Yeah,

1088
00:35:59,810 --> 00:36:00,510
you would be fun.

1089
00:36:00,510 --> 00:36:01,330
Fuck Eric Dubay.

1090
00:36:01,330 --> 00:36:02,370
If he's ever on the show,

1091
00:36:02,371 --> 00:36:05,190
I want to be outside waiting
with a fucking baseball bat.

1092
00:36:05,220 --> 00:36:05,611
Oh,

1093
00:36:05,611 --> 00:36:07,800
how do you want to be violent with him?

1094
00:36:07,830 --> 00:36:09,990
Almost almost that you
want to talk to him.

1095
00:36:09,991 --> 00:36:10,950
Would you have to meet?

1096
00:36:10,951 --> 00:36:14,880
I think you could gain a lot from sitting
down with a guy like this and just

1097
00:36:14,881 --> 00:36:18,420
sort of picking them apart because you
would realize what he was wrong about and

1098
00:36:18,421 --> 00:36:21,750
instead of him being able to just spout
off on a youtube video who'd would be

1099
00:36:21,751 --> 00:36:24,870
checked at every step of the way
whenever he said something incorrect.

1100
00:36:25,230 --> 00:36:25,890
Yes,

1101
00:36:25,890 --> 00:36:28,890
but the problem is the only
reason why I would do that,

1102
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:31,050
he will never change his mind.

1103
00:36:31,620 --> 00:36:31,711
Well,

1104
00:36:31,711 --> 00:36:32,760
he's probably crazy.

1105
00:36:33,030 --> 00:36:33,780
Well,

1106
00:36:33,780 --> 00:36:34,613
Duh.

1107
00:36:34,680 --> 00:36:36,060
He's absolutely crazy.

1108
00:36:36,120 --> 00:36:38,310
But think about it right now.

1109
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:42,270
You have 4 million subscribers
that now know this video exists,

1110
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:43,920
that no Eric debased name,

1111
00:36:44,070 --> 00:36:47,640
that know that paleontologist
w can get riled up by this guy.

1112
00:36:48,330 --> 00:36:49,440
They're now going to go look,

1113
00:36:49,470 --> 00:36:52,320
if any one of your listeners is
on the fence about dinosaurs,

1114
00:36:52,321 --> 00:36:53,550
why would you be?

1115
00:36:54,840 --> 00:36:55,950
But you could have some,

1116
00:36:56,790 --> 00:36:59,940
those are the people that I
would have to try and convince.

1117
00:36:59,970 --> 00:37:01,470
I will never convince him.

1118
00:37:01,950 --> 00:37:05,790
I will mock the living shit out of him
until he wants to put himself into a

1119
00:37:05,791 --> 00:37:06,630
chipper shredder.

1120
00:37:07,950 --> 00:37:09,540
But I will never convince him.

1121
00:37:10,260 --> 00:37:10,680
It's the,

1122
00:37:10,680 --> 00:37:11,220
and that's,

1123
00:37:11,220 --> 00:37:12,001
that's the thing.

1124
00:37:12,001 --> 00:37:14,220
So all you Sai Khan people out there,

1125
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:20,600
we don't do it to try and convince the
big mouth pieces for these movements were

1126
00:37:21,511 --> 00:37:25,650
trying to go for the people that aren't
quite sure if we embarrass the living

1127
00:37:25,651 --> 00:37:27,120
fuck out of these people,

1128
00:37:27,390 --> 00:37:28,230
those people would go,

1129
00:37:28,350 --> 00:37:28,681
wow,

1130
00:37:28,681 --> 00:37:29,730
those guys are idiots.

1131
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:32,940
Why did I even consider
that the world is flat,

1132
00:37:32,941 --> 00:37:34,200
or the dinosaurs didn't exist,

1133
00:37:34,201 --> 00:37:35,640
or creationism exists,

1134
00:37:35,641 --> 00:37:39,910
or chem trails or Nibiru fucking
rogue planets and shit like that.

1135
00:37:46,940 --> 00:37:47,773
Okay.

1136
00:37:49,980 --> 00:37:50,040
Okay.
