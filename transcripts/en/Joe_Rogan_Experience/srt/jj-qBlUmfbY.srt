1
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:01,700
The joe rogan experience,

2
00:00:01,760 --> 00:00:02,001
but,

3
00:00:02,001 --> 00:00:02,211
uh,

4
00:00:02,211 --> 00:00:05,480
I actually found out about you
through Kevin boost documentary.

5
00:00:05,510 --> 00:00:06,170
Um,

6
00:00:06,170 --> 00:00:06,471
uh,

7
00:00:06,471 --> 00:00:06,620
the,

8
00:00:06,620 --> 00:00:08,390
the great white hope American drug war.

9
00:00:08,750 --> 00:00:09,561
Kevin's a good guy.

10
00:00:09,561 --> 00:00:10,041
Kevin,

11
00:00:10,041 --> 00:00:10,820
uh,

12
00:00:10,820 --> 00:00:11,121
you know,

13
00:00:11,121 --> 00:00:12,770
kept an eye on me when I was in prison,

14
00:00:12,890 --> 00:00:13,580
you know,

15
00:00:13,580 --> 00:00:14,413
wrote me,

16
00:00:14,660 --> 00:00:15,471
I could call Kevin.

17
00:00:15,471 --> 00:00:16,990
He interviewed you from prison as well?

18
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:17,840
He did.

19
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:18,021
Yeah.

20
00:00:18,021 --> 00:00:18,950
When I met with Kevin,

21
00:00:18,951 --> 00:00:21,200
Kevin made my life a little
easier while I was in prison.

22
00:00:21,260 --> 00:00:22,093
You know,

23
00:00:22,190 --> 00:00:23,420
shout out to Kevin Booth.

24
00:00:23,950 --> 00:00:25,540
Kevin produced my first DVD.

25
00:00:26,130 --> 00:00:26,381
Oh,

26
00:00:26,381 --> 00:00:27,490
Daddy's comedy DVD.

27
00:00:29,620 --> 00:00:30,341
I sent the book,

28
00:00:30,341 --> 00:00:31,210
I read the book that,

29
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:31,480
uh,

30
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:31,840
he,

31
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:33,250
he his buddy road,

32
00:00:33,270 --> 00:00:33,580
uh,

33
00:00:33,580 --> 00:00:34,413
Bill Hicks.

34
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:35,120
Yeah.

35
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:35,953
Yeah.

36
00:00:36,580 --> 00:00:37,510
Kevin's a good guy though.

37
00:00:37,870 --> 00:00:38,171
Yeah,

38
00:00:38,171 --> 00:00:38,531
he,

39
00:00:38,531 --> 00:00:38,980
uh,

40
00:00:38,980 --> 00:00:42,670
he became who he is because of
his friendship with Bill Hicks.

41
00:00:42,671 --> 00:00:42,851
You know,

42
00:00:42,851 --> 00:00:46,330
he used to follow Bill Hicks around
and record them and Bill Hicks.

43
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:48,220
As far as standup comedians are concerned,

44
00:00:48,221 --> 00:00:50,950
like one of the top 10
greatest comedians of all time,

45
00:00:50,980 --> 00:00:51,670
for sure.

46
00:00:51,670 --> 00:00:52,210
You know,

47
00:00:52,210 --> 00:00:54,190
right up there with a lot of
people like Richard Pryor.

48
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:54,820
Right.

49
00:00:54,820 --> 00:00:58,460
Even though he didn't live very long died
of pancreatic cancer when he's only in

50
00:00:58,461 --> 00:00:59,530
his young thirties,

51
00:00:59,950 --> 00:01:00,221
you know.

52
00:01:00,221 --> 00:01:01,054
But um,

53
00:01:01,270 --> 00:01:02,470
so he creates this,

54
00:01:02,471 --> 00:01:03,281
this documentary,

55
00:01:03,281 --> 00:01:04,150
the American drug war.

56
00:01:04,151 --> 00:01:04,450
And that's,

57
00:01:04,450 --> 00:01:05,910
that's how I heard about you and I,

58
00:01:05,930 --> 00:01:06,870
and that's how I heard about,

59
00:01:06,871 --> 00:01:07,450
cause I had already,

60
00:01:07,450 --> 00:01:12,450
I had already heard about Barry seals and
Barry seal and his connection with the

61
00:01:12,611 --> 00:01:13,960
CIA and selling drugs.

62
00:01:13,961 --> 00:01:14,620
But I didn't,

63
00:01:14,620 --> 00:01:19,620
I didn't know of any one person like you
who could be directly connected to the

64
00:01:19,931 --> 00:01:24,240
dude that was connected to Nicaragua that
was connected to Oliver North and that

65
00:01:24,250 --> 00:01:25,390
the whole chain of events.

66
00:01:25,450 --> 00:01:26,141
Absolutely.

67
00:01:26,141 --> 00:01:26,731
Absolutely.

68
00:01:26,731 --> 00:01:26,900
Yes.

69
00:01:26,900 --> 00:01:28,130
I think when a window,

70
00:01:28,190 --> 00:01:29,930
when Glen on testified against me,

71
00:01:30,380 --> 00:01:31,430
he talked about

72
00:01:33,790 --> 00:01:37,340
his balls to going on a fishing
ship with a George Bush senior.

73
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:38,470
Wow.

74
00:01:38,470 --> 00:01:39,220
When the kid went,

75
00:01:39,220 --> 00:01:40,270
now Barry seal was murdered.

76
00:01:40,271 --> 00:01:41,980
He had George Bush phone
number in his pocket

77
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:47,470
as deep as it gets Migraine,

78
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:49,020
a tracking device in that phone number.

79
00:01:49,021 --> 00:01:49,240
Yeah.

80
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:50,073
I know where you at.

81
00:01:50,220 --> 00:01:51,240
And meanwhile,

82
00:01:51,241 --> 00:01:52,060
and meanwhile,

83
00:01:52,060 --> 00:01:53,500
no one goes to jail.

84
00:01:53,770 --> 00:01:55,170
No one on that side goes to jail.

85
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:55,960
Nothing.

86
00:01:55,960 --> 00:01:56,840
No one goes to jail,

87
00:01:56,850 --> 00:01:57,683
I should day.

88
00:01:57,700 --> 00:01:59,320
It's amazing they make the laws.

89
00:01:59,380 --> 00:02:01,800
But how the fuck did
they let you out at work?

90
00:02:01,810 --> 00:02:02,350
Yeah,

91
00:02:02,350 --> 00:02:03,220
they only you,

92
00:02:03,221 --> 00:02:04,300
you went in for 20 years.

93
00:02:04,390 --> 00:02:05,770
I had a life sentence man.

94
00:02:06,100 --> 00:02:07,060
And how'd you get out early?

95
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:10,750
Learning how to read and
write and study the law.

96
00:02:10,870 --> 00:02:12,310
And finally loophole.

97
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:13,233
What was the loophole?

98
00:02:14,190 --> 00:02:14,440
Well,

99
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:18,220
what they did is they charged me under
the three strike law and what they were

100
00:02:18,221 --> 00:02:22,270
saying is that since I had got convicted
and all these different states,

101
00:02:22,990 --> 00:02:25,330
that those added up to three strikes.

102
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:28,390
But what they didn't see in the,

103
00:02:28,391 --> 00:02:32,200
in the law is that in
order to get struck out,

104
00:02:32,260 --> 00:02:33,550
you have to go to prison,

105
00:02:34,390 --> 00:02:37,030
get out and committed another crime,

106
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:39,273
go to prison,

107
00:02:40,060 --> 00:02:41,840
get out and they commit the third one.

108
00:02:41,841 --> 00:02:42,820
And that's three strikes.

109
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,270
So we can't get you on three felonies
before you're ever convicted.

110
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:47,720
That three strikes,

111
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:49,220
three strikes if,

112
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:49,590
if,

113
00:02:49,590 --> 00:02:49,970
if,

114
00:02:49,970 --> 00:02:51,550
if safe hands.

115
00:02:51,551 --> 00:02:52,710
And what I use is,

116
00:02:52,711 --> 00:02:53,750
is a guy standing out.

117
00:02:53,751 --> 00:02:54,980
When I used to stand out on the street,

118
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:58,640
I used to make hundreds of sales a
day right there on that one block.

119
00:02:59,260 --> 00:03:00,190
So I said no.

120
00:03:01,690 --> 00:03:02,770
If somebody wanted to,

121
00:03:02,771 --> 00:03:07,030
they could have gave me a hundred
convictions because I saw different people

122
00:03:07,031 --> 00:03:07,630
every time.

123
00:03:07,630 --> 00:03:08,463
Right.

124
00:03:08,530 --> 00:03:13,530
So I didn't believe that the law meant
that every sale you may was a separate

125
00:03:13,871 --> 00:03:14,704
conviction.

126
00:03:14,950 --> 00:03:17,960
I believe that they meant
just like I just explained it.

127
00:03:18,170 --> 00:03:18,820
Right.

128
00:03:18,820 --> 00:03:19,571
Because if so,

129
00:03:19,571 --> 00:03:21,430
then everybody who ever sold cocaine,

130
00:03:21,431 --> 00:03:21,850
what happened?

131
00:03:21,850 --> 00:03:24,940
Three strikes and it makes sense
because the idea is supposed to be

132
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:28,510
theoretically that jail is supposed
to be able to really rehabilitate.

133
00:03:28,511 --> 00:03:28,680
Yeah,

134
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:29,090
exactly.

135
00:03:29,090 --> 00:03:31,960
So if you are unreal habilitate double,

136
00:03:31,990 --> 00:03:34,930
if you've gone through two separate
times and you're still out doing the same

137
00:03:34,931 --> 00:03:35,350
shit.

138
00:03:35,350 --> 00:03:35,591
All right,

139
00:03:35,591 --> 00:03:37,000
well this dude's a career criminal.

140
00:03:37,001 --> 00:03:38,560
This is his third offense done.

141
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:39,910
That makes sense.

142
00:03:39,910 --> 00:03:41,110
And that's how the law was rolled up.

143
00:03:41,140 --> 00:03:43,600
Even though I don't believe you should
play baseball with people lives.

144
00:03:43,930 --> 00:03:44,660
Right.

145
00:03:44,660 --> 00:03:48,610
Because the person could not be changed
at one time and then be changed tomorrow

146
00:03:48,611 --> 00:03:49,990
and then his circumstances changed.

147
00:03:49,991 --> 00:03:51,280
And he may be in a different position.

148
00:03:51,670 --> 00:03:52,001
You know,

149
00:03:52,001 --> 00:03:54,640
before you can start passing
judge judgment on people,

150
00:03:54,641 --> 00:03:57,580
you have the live in
their shoes and you know,

151
00:03:57,581 --> 00:03:58,810
that's why people ask me now,

152
00:03:58,811 --> 00:04:02,310
how do I feel about drug dealers
and I'm gonna and then it gets him,

153
00:04:03,150 --> 00:04:06,130
they'd do what they feel like they got
to do or what they know they got to do.

154
00:04:06,131 --> 00:04:06,964
So,

155
00:04:06,970 --> 00:04:07,803
uh,

156
00:04:07,930 --> 00:04:09,100
before we pass judgment,

157
00:04:09,130 --> 00:04:12,310
we have to get all the facts
and live in that person's shoes,

158
00:04:12,311 --> 00:04:12,670
the fee,

159
00:04:12,670 --> 00:04:14,260
if we would do the same
thing that they did.

160
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:15,950
And you're a perfect example of that.

161
00:04:16,070 --> 00:04:16,903
Absolutely.

162
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:17,770
Now you,

163
00:04:17,770 --> 00:04:18,410
you're away.

164
00:04:18,410 --> 00:04:19,700
You went away for 20 years,

165
00:04:19,701 --> 00:04:20,810
you find this loophole.

166
00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:24,200
How deep into your sentence had you
had already figured out how to read?

167
00:04:24,220 --> 00:04:24,440
How,

168
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:25,720
how long have you started reading it?

169
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:26,510
Immediately,

170
00:04:26,510 --> 00:04:27,343
right away.

171
00:04:27,950 --> 00:04:30,410
Take classes there and I taught my,

172
00:04:30,411 --> 00:04:30,971
me and my celly,

173
00:04:30,971 --> 00:04:31,820
he taught me how to read.

174
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:34,790
He made me some cue cards with
my ABC's on them and her cool.

175
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:35,391
And went from,

176
00:04:35,391 --> 00:04:40,391
from nose to a reading my indictment to
reading the newspapers to a Tureen law

177
00:04:41,001 --> 00:04:41,330
books.

178
00:04:41,330 --> 00:04:41,661
I mean,

179
00:04:41,661 --> 00:04:41,931
you know,

180
00:04:41,931 --> 00:04:45,020
for the first time when I found out is
that I had never wanted to read before in

181
00:04:45,021 --> 00:04:45,854
my life.

182
00:04:46,220 --> 00:04:47,270
That was the real problem.

183
00:04:47,271 --> 00:04:48,380
I never really wanted to read.

184
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:49,310
Right.

185
00:04:49,310 --> 00:04:49,581
I mean,

186
00:04:49,581 --> 00:04:52,790
I didn't see any reason why Jack and
Jill went up the hill and why I should

187
00:04:52,791 --> 00:04:53,624
know.

188
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:58,490
You know what I'm saying?

189
00:04:58,490 --> 00:05:00,860
They didn't have it when Jason no money.

190
00:05:00,861 --> 00:05:01,730
I would say some money.

191
00:05:01,870 --> 00:05:02,171
Right,

192
00:05:02,171 --> 00:05:02,381
right,

193
00:05:02,381 --> 00:05:03,130
right.

194
00:05:03,130 --> 00:05:03,431
It was,

195
00:05:03,431 --> 00:05:04,480
it wasn't interesting to you.

196
00:05:04,570 --> 00:05:05,710
It wasn't interesting to me.

197
00:05:05,740 --> 00:05:07,210
But then once you realize,

198
00:05:07,211 --> 00:05:07,331
well,

199
00:05:07,331 --> 00:05:09,770
there's a lot of information
that I don't have access to.

200
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:11,990
I became an advocate reading.

201
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:14,090
I read over 300 books
before I left prison.

202
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:14,820
Really?

203
00:05:14,820 --> 00:05:15,390
Yeah.

204
00:05:15,390 --> 00:05:15,810
Wow.

205
00:05:15,810 --> 00:05:17,730
You've read more books
than I have in my lifetime.

206
00:05:17,780 --> 00:05:18,510
Yeah.

207
00:05:18,510 --> 00:05:20,040
So you're in prison,

208
00:05:20,310 --> 00:05:20,611
you're,

209
00:05:20,611 --> 00:05:20,911
you're,

210
00:05:20,911 --> 00:05:21,744
you're learning how to read.

211
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:26,760
At what point in time did
you start devising a plan
to try to like figure out a

212
00:05:27,481 --> 00:05:28,350
way to get out of there?

213
00:05:29,290 --> 00:05:29,540
Well,

214
00:05:29,540 --> 00:05:30,950
immediately I was trying to get out,

215
00:05:31,010 --> 00:05:31,371
you know,

216
00:05:31,371 --> 00:05:36,210
I knew that the guys that were going
home was it guys that was going to a

217
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:36,820
library,

218
00:05:36,820 --> 00:05:38,000
learn how to become lawyers.

219
00:05:38,450 --> 00:05:38,781
You know,

220
00:05:38,781 --> 00:05:42,140
they knew how to fight the system and
then they had like guys that all they did

221
00:05:42,141 --> 00:05:43,580
all day was sit there and study the law.

222
00:05:44,030 --> 00:05:44,271
You know,

223
00:05:44,271 --> 00:05:48,500
they would sit at the table while other
people were playing cards and chess and

224
00:05:48,501 --> 00:05:49,334
Domino's.

225
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:50,630
They would be studying the law.

226
00:05:50,660 --> 00:05:51,290
So I got,

227
00:05:51,290 --> 00:05:52,430
I got in with those guys.

228
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:54,110
It's gotta be kind of a crazy feeling,

229
00:05:54,111 --> 00:05:54,530
man.

230
00:05:54,530 --> 00:05:57,200
Everybody's just hoping you
can crack this fucking system.

231
00:05:57,320 --> 00:05:57,621
Got You.

232
00:05:57,621 --> 00:05:58,100
Locked

233
00:05:58,100 --> 00:05:59,570
up is tough.

234
00:06:00,020 --> 00:06:02,420
What is the hedge to hurt daily?

235
00:06:02,421 --> 00:06:02,751
You get,

236
00:06:02,751 --> 00:06:06,710
you got like migraine headaches and
you sitting in this concrete building,

237
00:06:07,070 --> 00:06:08,570
I'm going to try to
draw a picture for you.

238
00:06:09,110 --> 00:06:12,410
You sitting in this concrete
building is 28 stories high.

239
00:06:13,090 --> 00:06:13,923
Um,

240
00:06:14,030 --> 00:06:15,770
nothing but concrete and steel.

241
00:06:16,190 --> 00:06:21,190
The windows are about three inches
wide open and about six feet long

242
00:06:23,900 --> 00:06:24,733
escaped.

243
00:06:24,870 --> 00:06:27,020
It looks almost impossible.

244
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:27,801
But you know,

245
00:06:27,801 --> 00:06:28,790
you think about that too.

246
00:06:28,791 --> 00:06:29,001
Like,

247
00:06:29,001 --> 00:06:29,960
if I had a long rope,

248
00:06:29,961 --> 00:06:31,550
I could scale the side of the building.

249
00:06:32,300 --> 00:06:32,661
So,

250
00:06:32,661 --> 00:06:33,494
uh,

251
00:06:33,950 --> 00:06:35,180
it's like a desperation,

252
00:06:35,181 --> 00:06:35,571
you know,

253
00:06:35,571 --> 00:06:35,961
and you're saying,

254
00:06:35,961 --> 00:06:36,171
man,

255
00:06:36,171 --> 00:06:41,171
it gotta be one loophole in these books
because you know that if you can show

256
00:06:42,651 --> 00:06:45,890
them in the book where they made a
mistake or where the book says that they

257
00:06:45,891 --> 00:06:46,760
should have did this,

258
00:06:46,850 --> 00:06:47,810
when they did that,

259
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:48,651
then you know,

260
00:06:48,651 --> 00:06:49,490
you got action.

261
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:50,611
So you're,

262
00:06:50,611 --> 00:06:50,821
you,

263
00:06:50,821 --> 00:06:53,150
you're getting headaches just from
thinking and reading too much.

264
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:53,801
Yeah.

265
00:06:53,801 --> 00:06:54,820
That's all you want to do.

266
00:06:54,870 --> 00:06:56,260
You just want to stand them books.

267
00:06:56,261 --> 00:06:56,760
You know,

268
00:06:56,760 --> 00:06:57,050
they,

269
00:06:57,050 --> 00:06:58,090
I got a life sentence,

270
00:06:58,120 --> 00:06:58,421
you know,

271
00:06:58,421 --> 00:06:59,380
when you've got a life sentence,

272
00:06:59,381 --> 00:07:00,820
it's like this is forever.

273
00:07:01,210 --> 00:07:01,571
You know,

274
00:07:01,571 --> 00:07:03,580
this is all you're going to
see for the rest of your life,

275
00:07:03,581 --> 00:07:04,001
you know?

276
00:07:04,001 --> 00:07:04,834
So,

277
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:05,753
um,

278
00:07:06,220 --> 00:07:07,570
I didn't think that was fitting for me.

279
00:07:07,900 --> 00:07:11,290
It's amazing that they convicted you
for life on that three strikes law.

280
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:15,310
It seems like you should be able to
go after them for abusing the law,

281
00:07:15,311 --> 00:07:16,600
which should be criminal.

282
00:07:16,690 --> 00:07:16,841
Well,

283
00:07:16,841 --> 00:07:17,321
you can't,

284
00:07:17,321 --> 00:07:19,000
you can't go at the federal prosecutor.

285
00:07:19,001 --> 00:07:19,834
He's immune.

286
00:07:19,900 --> 00:07:20,531
That's amazing.

287
00:07:20,531 --> 00:07:20,830
From,

288
00:07:20,830 --> 00:07:21,160
from,

289
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:23,640
from prosecution because he,

290
00:07:23,670 --> 00:07:25,240
he's not working as an individual.

291
00:07:25,300 --> 00:07:27,010
Even if it's been proven
that he's corrupt.

292
00:07:27,820 --> 00:07:31,990
Well maybe if you can prove he's
he's corrupt but we're not because he

293
00:07:32,020 --> 00:07:34,150
incompetent and justly that yeah.

294
00:07:34,151 --> 00:07:34,870
In combination.

295
00:07:34,870 --> 00:07:35,703
In your case,

296
00:07:35,780 --> 00:07:36,090
you know,

297
00:07:36,090 --> 00:07:37,170
if he does something to you,

298
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:37,510
you know,

299
00:07:37,510 --> 00:07:40,780
you could charge you with a thousand
keys even though you only had one,

300
00:07:41,650 --> 00:07:42,420
you know,

301
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:43,630
and if you've got a thousand keys,

302
00:07:43,631 --> 00:07:43,871
you know,

303
00:07:43,871 --> 00:07:44,920
that gives you a life sentence.

304
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:45,753
If you got one,

305
00:07:46,030 --> 00:07:46,241
you know,

306
00:07:46,241 --> 00:07:47,200
you get probation.

307
00:07:47,410 --> 00:07:48,880
But uh,

308
00:07:48,940 --> 00:07:49,773
if it's powder,

309
00:07:50,950 --> 00:07:51,321
that's a,

310
00:07:51,321 --> 00:07:52,990
that's a thing people
don't know about that.

311
00:07:53,100 --> 00:07:53,820
Good point.

312
00:07:53,820 --> 00:07:57,910
Not Crap because crack was in the
ghetto and powder was all these,

313
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:58,600
you know,

314
00:07:58,600 --> 00:07:59,440
other people,

315
00:07:59,590 --> 00:08:02,470
these people that had money
were using the powder.

316
00:08:02,890 --> 00:08:04,840
Crack is way more illegal.

317
00:08:04,870 --> 00:08:05,101
Yeah.

318
00:08:05,101 --> 00:08:07,090
It was a hundred to 100 to one.

319
00:08:07,150 --> 00:08:07,983
Wow.

320
00:08:08,410 --> 00:08:09,310
That's incredible.

321
00:08:09,340 --> 00:08:09,781
That is,

322
00:08:09,781 --> 00:08:10,810
is that racist?

323
00:08:11,050 --> 00:08:11,890
Very racist.

324
00:08:11,891 --> 00:08:12,820
And it has to be right.

325
00:08:12,850 --> 00:08:13,690
And I think,

326
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:14,201
I mean,

327
00:08:14,201 --> 00:08:16,270
and even though they just
changed it 18 to one,

328
00:08:16,330 --> 00:08:17,560
I think that was still,

329
00:08:18,700 --> 00:08:19,630
why isn't it one to one?

330
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:21,970
And that's what I said
because they already proved,

331
00:08:22,210 --> 00:08:22,421
you know,

332
00:08:22,421 --> 00:08:24,640
I sat down on the couch with
the guy who invented the law.

333
00:08:25,180 --> 00:08:25,800
Really?

334
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:25,980
Yeah.

335
00:08:25,980 --> 00:08:28,130
It's going to be in the
documentary six six,

336
00:08:28,131 --> 00:08:29,950
six documentary after you're out.

337
00:08:29,980 --> 00:08:30,920
You sat down with the,

338
00:08:30,990 --> 00:08:32,320
I've been doing that since I've been out.

339
00:08:32,350 --> 00:08:35,010
I've been doing the documentary
since I've been out and,

340
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:35,770
and,

341
00:08:35,770 --> 00:08:36,101
and,

342
00:08:36,101 --> 00:08:39,790
and one of the things that I got
mad about even with Obama and his

343
00:08:39,791 --> 00:08:41,740
administration is that they
didn't make it one on one.

344
00:08:41,741 --> 00:08:46,180
And then even after they made it 1801
they left it for guys who have been in 20

345
00:08:46,181 --> 00:08:46,451
years,

346
00:08:46,451 --> 00:08:47,261
25 years,

347
00:08:47,261 --> 00:08:48,490
they didn't make it retroactive.

348
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:50,800
Meaning that they don't get out.

349
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:52,420
They don't get no benefit from the,

350
00:08:52,421 --> 00:08:53,260
from the 18 to one.

351
00:08:53,261 --> 00:08:54,220
It's guys right now,

352
00:08:54,221 --> 00:08:54,611
if they,

353
00:08:54,611 --> 00:08:56,640
if they the 18 one,

354
00:08:56,641 --> 00:08:57,960
they will walk out of prison today.

355
00:08:58,710 --> 00:08:59,130
Wow.

356
00:08:59,130 --> 00:09:00,840
So I'm saying if it's wrong today,

357
00:09:01,590 --> 00:09:03,780
and you did it 20 years
ago was wronged in,

358
00:09:04,170 --> 00:09:04,740
right.

359
00:09:04,740 --> 00:09:05,370
But they said,

360
00:09:05,370 --> 00:09:08,090
oh well there they lost their,

361
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:08,730
uh,

362
00:09:08,730 --> 00:09:09,061
cause you know,

363
00:09:09,061 --> 00:09:11,520
Clinton signed the bill where you're 2155.

364
00:09:11,521 --> 00:09:14,460
You've got one year after you convicted
to come up with newly discovered

365
00:09:14,461 --> 00:09:15,240
evidence.

366
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:16,290
And the law is crazy,

367
00:09:16,291 --> 00:09:16,890
man.

368
00:09:16,890 --> 00:09:17,581
Like right now,

369
00:09:17,581 --> 00:09:18,161
say a few minutes.

370
00:09:18,161 --> 00:09:22,470
If you go to prison unjustly and you
do all your appeals and everything,

371
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:24,593
one year,

372
00:09:25,020 --> 00:09:27,150
you got one year to
prove yourself innocent.

373
00:09:27,510 --> 00:09:28,740
Now after that one year,

374
00:09:30,210 --> 00:09:34,050
if you don't find it and then a day
after that one year you find this newly

375
00:09:34,051 --> 00:09:34,980
discovered evidence,

376
00:09:35,010 --> 00:09:36,510
you can't even submit it to the coach.

377
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:37,513
Oh,

378
00:09:37,980 --> 00:09:39,150
that's gotta be maddening.

379
00:09:39,630 --> 00:09:40,351
It's maddening.

380
00:09:40,351 --> 00:09:41,360
They got guys in there that,

381
00:09:41,380 --> 00:09:41,570
that,

382
00:09:41,570 --> 00:09:45,690
that found newly discovered evidence that
they can't even submit it for anybody

383
00:09:45,691 --> 00:09:46,524
to hear it.

384
00:09:46,540 --> 00:09:48,550
So when you went to jail for this,

385
00:09:48,551 --> 00:09:49,900
so when you're finally in prison,

386
00:09:49,901 --> 00:09:50,151
was there,

387
00:09:50,151 --> 00:09:50,290
there,

388
00:09:50,290 --> 00:09:53,320
was this the first time you'd ever been
in prison other than the one time you

389
00:09:53,321 --> 00:09:55,390
got arrested and you
stayed in there for awhile?

390
00:09:55,580 --> 00:09:55,851
No,

391
00:09:55,851 --> 00:09:56,220
no,

392
00:09:56,220 --> 00:09:56,370
I,

393
00:09:56,370 --> 00:09:58,310
that was my second time when
I got the life sentence.

394
00:09:58,311 --> 00:09:59,330
I've been to jail twice.

395
00:09:59,770 --> 00:10:00,790
So you had two strikes,

396
00:10:00,791 --> 00:10:01,624
you had one strike,

397
00:10:01,820 --> 00:10:02,471
two strike on,

398
00:10:02,471 --> 00:10:02,591
right?

399
00:10:02,591 --> 00:10:04,120
How long did you go
away for the first time?

400
00:10:04,130 --> 00:10:05,360
A five and a half years.

401
00:10:05,780 --> 00:10:06,613
Wow.

402
00:10:06,620 --> 00:10:08,570
So you were in the second
time I was in trapped.

403
00:10:08,930 --> 00:10:11,900
I didn't even go into that point when
I was in trap because I wasn't selling

404
00:10:11,901 --> 00:10:12,734
drugs.

405
00:10:12,860 --> 00:10:17,860
I was building a youth center because
when I did is I figured out what kids in

406
00:10:18,831 --> 00:10:21,830
the ghetto need to get them
out of gangs and drugs.

407
00:10:22,190 --> 00:10:23,060
I know what they need.

408
00:10:23,570 --> 00:10:24,980
So when I did is I bought,

409
00:10:25,300 --> 00:10:26,270
I bought at the aid,

410
00:10:26,450 --> 00:10:26,900
they need some,

411
00:10:26,900 --> 00:10:27,140
some,

412
00:10:27,140 --> 00:10:28,040
some instructions.

413
00:10:28,250 --> 00:10:30,650
They need somebody to come and and,

414
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:31,700
and walk them through it.

415
00:10:31,701 --> 00:10:34,820
Somebody they can go and talk to
when they need to talk to him,

416
00:10:34,910 --> 00:10:35,361
you know,

417
00:10:35,361 --> 00:10:39,440
not talk to him once they already been
corrupted and their heads are already in

418
00:10:39,441 --> 00:10:39,741
the game,

419
00:10:39,741 --> 00:10:40,760
they don't want to hear you then,

420
00:10:40,790 --> 00:10:41,091
you know,

421
00:10:41,091 --> 00:10:42,260
I already got my mind made up.

422
00:10:42,261 --> 00:10:42,950
I know what I'm doing.

423
00:10:42,950 --> 00:10:43,790
I'm home man.

424
00:10:44,390 --> 00:10:45,890
But before they get like that,

425
00:10:46,310 --> 00:10:47,150
they need somebody,

426
00:10:47,151 --> 00:10:49,030
a place that they can go and,

427
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:54,120
and they could talk to Joe Rogan or Rick
Ross or magic Johnson or Oprah Winfrey

428
00:10:55,100 --> 00:11:00,100
or some of these other people who could
teach them how to make money other ways,

429
00:11:00,410 --> 00:11:00,621
you know,

430
00:11:00,621 --> 00:11:01,051
because in,

431
00:11:01,051 --> 00:11:01,641
in the ghetto,

432
00:11:01,641 --> 00:11:01,851
you know,

433
00:11:01,851 --> 00:11:03,260
the first business you see in the ghetto,

434
00:11:03,261 --> 00:11:03,710
you know,

435
00:11:03,710 --> 00:11:06,020
the first business is what the drug man,

436
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:09,800
he's going to be the first
businessman that you see in,

437
00:11:09,801 --> 00:11:13,670
in south central Los Angeles is going to
be the drunk man and especially a black

438
00:11:13,671 --> 00:11:15,830
man as a business owner because we don't,

439
00:11:15,860 --> 00:11:16,221
we don't,

440
00:11:16,221 --> 00:11:17,210
nothing in south central.

441
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:18,390
So you,

442
00:11:19,590 --> 00:11:20,460
when you got,

443
00:11:20,690 --> 00:11:22,080
so you said you got set up.

444
00:11:22,380 --> 00:11:23,550
This is the last time.

445
00:11:23,740 --> 00:11:24,191
Yeah.

446
00:11:24,191 --> 00:11:24,431
Yeah.

447
00:11:24,431 --> 00:11:25,450
When I got the life sentence,

448
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:26,440
this guy called me.

449
00:11:26,710 --> 00:11:27,730
I'm not selling drugs,

450
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:28,810
selling drugs are on,

451
00:11:28,811 --> 00:11:29,020
and I'm,

452
00:11:29,020 --> 00:11:29,680
I had,

453
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:32,860
I hadn't sold drugs and six years,

454
00:11:32,861 --> 00:11:33,694
seven years.

455
00:11:33,820 --> 00:11:34,390
Wow.

456
00:11:34,390 --> 00:11:35,260
How did you stop?

457
00:11:35,770 --> 00:11:36,603
I just quit.

458
00:11:36,970 --> 00:11:38,080
Did you quit after you got arrested?

459
00:11:38,081 --> 00:11:39,280
The first time in five years.

460
00:11:39,330 --> 00:11:41,200
I quit a year and a half
before I went to prison.

461
00:11:41,230 --> 00:11:41,711
I was like,

462
00:11:41,711 --> 00:11:42,310
man,

463
00:11:42,310 --> 00:11:42,971
I'm through with this.

464
00:11:42,971 --> 00:11:43,610
I got,

465
00:11:43,610 --> 00:11:45,880
I got eight $900,000 cash.

466
00:11:46,330 --> 00:11:48,070
I've got property all over the place.

467
00:11:48,420 --> 00:11:52,030
All I got to do now is make this property
and stuff work for me and you know

468
00:11:52,060 --> 00:11:53,920
I've got enough money to
hold me off for awhile.

469
00:11:54,670 --> 00:11:55,503
I'm through with it.

470
00:11:55,630 --> 00:11:56,860
So I walked away from the game.

471
00:11:57,590 --> 00:12:01,490
So I'm confused as on your timeline
here because when you were 20 years old,

472
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:04,790
that's when you started and then
when you were 28 you got arrested.

473
00:12:05,060 --> 00:12:05,331
Right?

474
00:12:05,331 --> 00:12:06,860
But you did five years in jail,

475
00:12:07,850 --> 00:12:08,300
right?

476
00:12:08,300 --> 00:12:09,320
Where's the five years?

477
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:13,240
I did five years in 89 I went to prison.

478
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:14,113
How old were you then?

479
00:12:15,030 --> 00:12:17,540
28 Dash 28 28 and a half.

480
00:12:17,541 --> 00:12:20,510
You go to jail for five years
and then you get out for,

481
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:21,200
I got out,

482
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:24,080
I got off for six months for six
months and then they give you the life

483
00:12:24,081 --> 00:12:24,914
sentence.

484
00:12:25,190 --> 00:12:26,023
Whoa,

485
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:27,073
God damn.

486
00:12:27,770 --> 00:12:28,950
So the life sentences,

487
00:12:28,970 --> 00:12:29,840
a total setup.

488
00:12:30,590 --> 00:12:31,423
Total setup.

489
00:12:31,910 --> 00:12:32,743
Total entrapment.

490
00:12:32,780 --> 00:12:33,950
I was not selling drugs.

491
00:12:33,951 --> 00:12:36,990
Then they'll call me in a matter of fact,

492
00:12:36,991 --> 00:12:38,150
he called me the day I got a prison.

493
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:39,530
Whoa.

494
00:12:39,530 --> 00:12:40,220
He was like,

495
00:12:40,220 --> 00:12:40,461
man,

496
00:12:40,461 --> 00:12:41,091
I need to see you.

497
00:12:41,091 --> 00:12:41,361
I was like,

498
00:12:41,361 --> 00:12:41,541
man,

499
00:12:41,541 --> 00:12:42,560
I'm kicking it with my mom.

500
00:12:42,810 --> 00:12:43,101
You know,

501
00:12:43,101 --> 00:12:45,770
my mom came and see me
and stuff like that.

502
00:12:45,771 --> 00:12:46,071
So I'm like,

503
00:12:46,071 --> 00:12:46,930
I'm kicking it with my mom.

504
00:12:46,931 --> 00:12:47,760
I'm cool.

505
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:48,860
I hydrogen a couple of days.

506
00:12:48,861 --> 00:12:52,070
So when I finally going to highlight
and he's telling me how man,

507
00:12:52,071 --> 00:12:53,180
I got it at this price,

508
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:54,081
at that price,

509
00:12:54,081 --> 00:12:54,914
I was like,

510
00:12:54,950 --> 00:12:55,850
that's a good price.

511
00:12:58,430 --> 00:12:59,840
And all this is recorded too.

512
00:12:59,841 --> 00:13:01,580
So that didn't help.

513
00:13:01,730 --> 00:13:02,030
You know,

514
00:13:02,030 --> 00:13:02,470
they was like,

515
00:13:02,470 --> 00:13:02,730
oh,

516
00:13:02,730 --> 00:13:03,740
you were interested.

517
00:13:03,890 --> 00:13:04,640
Wow.

518
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:05,001
So,

519
00:13:05,001 --> 00:13:05,834
uh,

520
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:08,250
this went on for six
months that he courted me,

521
00:13:08,251 --> 00:13:08,870
you know,

522
00:13:08,870 --> 00:13:09,530
calling me,

523
00:13:09,530 --> 00:13:10,400
dropping the price,

524
00:13:10,401 --> 00:13:11,780
driving a motherfucker.

525
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:12,561
And then,

526
00:13:12,561 --> 00:13:12,700
uh,

527
00:13:12,700 --> 00:13:15,110
one day he caught me and I was
riding with one of my little homies,

528
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:17,833
Chico Brown,

529
00:13:17,850 --> 00:13:18,683
you know,

530
00:13:19,700 --> 00:13:19,991
I said,

531
00:13:19,991 --> 00:13:20,301
man,

532
00:13:20,301 --> 00:13:21,410
this dude just told me,

533
00:13:21,430 --> 00:13:22,130
uh,

534
00:13:22,130 --> 00:13:22,691
oop.

535
00:13:22,691 --> 00:13:23,121
And she goes,

536
00:13:23,121 --> 00:13:23,571
look man,

537
00:13:23,571 --> 00:13:24,500
I can sell all that.

538
00:13:27,050 --> 00:13:28,130
That's how I got started.

539
00:13:28,220 --> 00:13:30,620
So I wind up making an
introduction to the two of them.

540
00:13:31,180 --> 00:13:34,370
She'd go hand in the money and
the police come from everywhere.

541
00:13:34,690 --> 00:13:36,460
So you'd never even got to sell?

542
00:13:36,670 --> 00:13:36,911
No,

543
00:13:36,911 --> 00:13:37,780
I never saw it.

544
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:38,920
So this guy,

545
00:13:38,921 --> 00:13:39,754
where is he now?

546
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:40,633
Danilo.

547
00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:41,461
Uh,

548
00:13:41,461 --> 00:13:42,330
he's in Nicaragua.

549
00:13:42,810 --> 00:13:43,470
Just chilling.

550
00:13:43,470 --> 00:13:47,180
He's supposed to be in the
documentary to really yell.

551
00:13:47,210 --> 00:13:48,890
Y'all better check that documentary out.

552
00:13:48,900 --> 00:13:49,600
It's going to be though.

553
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:50,380
It's awesome.

554
00:13:50,380 --> 00:13:50,890
Date.

555
00:13:50,890 --> 00:13:53,590
Now this Danilo [inaudible] had a cop.

556
00:13:53,591 --> 00:13:54,840
That plan didn't you or hugs.

557
00:13:54,970 --> 00:13:56,080
Whoa.

558
00:13:56,670 --> 00:13:57,160
It's,

559
00:13:57,160 --> 00:13:58,780
do you have proof that
he planted to the drugs?

560
00:13:59,340 --> 00:14:00,151
I know he plans.

561
00:14:00,151 --> 00:14:00,984
You're drunk.

562
00:14:01,510 --> 00:14:02,310
He went to jail.

563
00:14:02,310 --> 00:14:02,491
No,

564
00:14:02,491 --> 00:14:03,800
I don't think he's going to medi plans.

565
00:14:03,801 --> 00:14:04,051
You're drove.

566
00:14:04,051 --> 00:14:05,070
But he went to jail for it.

567
00:14:05,610 --> 00:14:08,190
He went to jail for planting
those drugs for corruption.

568
00:14:08,250 --> 00:14:08,521
You know,

569
00:14:08,521 --> 00:14:10,410
beaten people plan drugs.

570
00:14:10,470 --> 00:14:10,921
He was doing,

571
00:14:10,921 --> 00:14:12,880
I don't police it was a habit.

572
00:14:14,190 --> 00:14:15,060
I mean he made money,

573
00:14:15,061 --> 00:14:15,894
man.

574
00:14:16,110 --> 00:14:16,351
Yeah,

575
00:14:16,351 --> 00:14:17,780
well that's where the rampart comes down.

576
00:14:17,790 --> 00:14:18,780
I mean for people don't know.

577
00:14:18,781 --> 00:14:19,260
Most.

578
00:14:19,260 --> 00:14:24,260
Most police officers at this point in
time believe that should ignite hired cops

579
00:14:24,780 --> 00:14:27,030
to kill biggie smalls and that,

580
00:14:27,060 --> 00:14:27,570
um,

581
00:14:27,570 --> 00:14:28,500
they also,

582
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:33,560
he probably also had Tupac killed
and that he did it all under this,

583
00:14:33,930 --> 00:14:37,140
under this rampart division cause
rampart division was working for him.

584
00:14:37,530 --> 00:14:39,630
I mean there's a huge rolling
stone article about it.

585
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:40,830
It's fascinating,

586
00:14:40,831 --> 00:14:45,831
fascinating shit that the cops were so
dirty that the cops were working with

587
00:14:46,110 --> 00:14:46,860
gang members.

588
00:14:46,860 --> 00:14:47,970
They're working with murderers,

589
00:14:47,971 --> 00:14:50,880
working with criminals and
making money clearly profiting.

590
00:14:51,750 --> 00:14:51,871
Well,

591
00:14:51,871 --> 00:14:52,141
you know,

592
00:14:52,141 --> 00:14:52,751
cops man,

593
00:14:52,751 --> 00:14:53,910
they just like everybody else,

594
00:14:53,911 --> 00:14:54,744
you know,

595
00:14:55,860 --> 00:14:56,640
they lie,

596
00:14:56,640 --> 00:15:00,540
cheat and all other things that the
normal person goes through in life.

597
00:15:00,541 --> 00:15:02,490
So I don't put nothing past him,

598
00:15:02,491 --> 00:15:04,560
especially when you start putting
all that money on the table.

599
00:15:04,561 --> 00:15:04,801
You know,

600
00:15:04,801 --> 00:15:09,150
I remember my first young guy who got
arrested by him and they stole his money.

601
00:15:09,151 --> 00:15:10,770
He was like 16 years old,

602
00:15:11,410 --> 00:15:11,790
you know,

603
00:15:11,790 --> 00:15:12,391
he called me,

604
00:15:12,391 --> 00:15:12,730
he's like,

605
00:15:12,730 --> 00:15:13,231
wait man,

606
00:15:13,231 --> 00:15:14,640
the cops just raided my house.

607
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:15,661
I was like,

608
00:15:15,661 --> 00:15:15,961
yeah,

609
00:15:15,961 --> 00:15:16,230
you are.

610
00:15:16,230 --> 00:15:16,560
I ain't,

611
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:16,921
and he was like,

612
00:15:16,921 --> 00:15:17,101
yeah,

613
00:15:17,101 --> 00:15:17,934
I'm cool.

614
00:15:18,260 --> 00:15:18,541
I was like,

615
00:15:18,541 --> 00:15:19,251
what'd you am?

616
00:15:19,251 --> 00:15:19,531
He was like,

617
00:15:19,531 --> 00:15:19,711
man,

618
00:15:19,711 --> 00:15:21,360
I had like $40,000.

619
00:15:21,900 --> 00:15:22,171
I said,

620
00:15:22,171 --> 00:15:23,004
what happened?

621
00:15:23,730 --> 00:15:24,061
He said,

622
00:15:24,061 --> 00:15:24,271
man,

623
00:15:24,271 --> 00:15:26,640
they asked me who money was
and I told him it wasn't mine.

624
00:15:26,641 --> 00:15:27,540
They told me to go.

625
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:31,290
So when he got out,

626
00:15:31,291 --> 00:15:32,160
when I got with him,

627
00:15:32,370 --> 00:15:32,701
you know,

628
00:15:32,701 --> 00:15:33,511
we call the lawyer,

629
00:15:33,511 --> 00:15:34,111
you're in total oil,

630
00:15:34,111 --> 00:15:34,710
you hey man,

631
00:15:34,710 --> 00:15:36,600
it was $40,000 at that house,

632
00:15:36,601 --> 00:15:37,421
but wasn't no drug.

633
00:15:37,421 --> 00:15:38,400
So he called and they said,

634
00:15:38,401 --> 00:15:38,581
man,

635
00:15:38,581 --> 00:15:39,660
with no money at that house.

636
00:15:41,950 --> 00:15:42,610
Wow.

637
00:15:42,610 --> 00:15:43,510
That's super common,

638
00:15:43,511 --> 00:15:44,080
right?

639
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:44,411
Yeah.

640
00:15:44,411 --> 00:15:44,591
Yeah.

641
00:15:44,591 --> 00:15:45,640
That happened all the time.

642
00:15:45,670 --> 00:15:48,550
There's no one policing the police.

643
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:50,740
There's no one governing the government.

644
00:15:51,030 --> 00:15:53,020
It's a real issue.

645
00:15:53,050 --> 00:15:53,860
They got the beginner,

646
00:15:53,860 --> 00:15:54,790
they got the guns.

647
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:55,250
Well,

648
00:15:55,250 --> 00:15:55,871
not only that,

649
00:15:55,871 --> 00:15:57,250
they can change the laws.

650
00:15:57,251 --> 00:15:59,440
I mean we see what the fuck is
going on now with this country.

651
00:15:59,441 --> 00:16:02,020
It was like every week
they'd come up with some new,

652
00:16:02,170 --> 00:16:03,490
even more restrictive,

653
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:06,010
even more or wetland
law that gets through.

654
00:16:06,011 --> 00:16:08,920
That allows them to tap
your phones with no wire,

655
00:16:08,921 --> 00:16:09,701
with no warrants.

656
00:16:09,701 --> 00:16:10,450
Rather,

657
00:16:10,450 --> 00:16:11,080
you know,

658
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:13,360
listening on your phone calls,

659
00:16:13,420 --> 00:16:16,870
tap your fucking gps systems that
could follow everywhere you go.

660
00:16:16,990 --> 00:16:19,060
And they can do all this
shit without warrants now.

661
00:16:19,580 --> 00:16:22,210
And they do it supposedly
under the guise of terrorism.

662
00:16:22,420 --> 00:16:26,110
But it's really under the guise of making
it easier for them to prosecute you

663
00:16:26,111 --> 00:16:29,710
for whatever the fuck they want to cause
he's a goddamn business and locking

664
00:16:29,711 --> 00:16:30,910
people up in cages.

665
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:31,671
Exactly.

666
00:16:31,671 --> 00:16:32,330
Exactly.

667
00:16:32,330 --> 00:16:33,410
So that's what they into.

668
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:37,700
So you find your loophole
and then you chase after it,

669
00:16:37,730 --> 00:16:38,370
you're in jail.

670
00:16:38,370 --> 00:16:38,710
Right.

671
00:16:38,710 --> 00:16:40,120
And then once you find it,

672
00:16:40,210 --> 00:16:40,410
Luke,

673
00:16:40,410 --> 00:16:42,130
I remember that day when
I read it in the book,

674
00:16:42,410 --> 00:16:42,881
it was like,

675
00:16:42,881 --> 00:16:43,714
man,

676
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:45,390
he just like popped out at me.

677
00:16:45,460 --> 00:16:46,293
Boom,

678
00:16:47,020 --> 00:16:47,890
go to jail,

679
00:16:47,950 --> 00:16:50,800
commit a crime and get released.

680
00:16:51,580 --> 00:16:53,140
I started to the phone
to call my minority.

681
00:16:53,141 --> 00:16:53,381
I see,

682
00:16:53,381 --> 00:16:53,561
man,

683
00:16:53,561 --> 00:16:54,394
I found it.

684
00:16:54,590 --> 00:16:55,423
Wow.

685
00:16:55,760 --> 00:16:57,170
So what happens then

686
00:16:57,610 --> 00:16:59,830
where was discouraging what
he said after he read it,

687
00:16:59,831 --> 00:17:01,360
he didn't see it the same way I did.

688
00:17:02,410 --> 00:17:04,090
You're a better lawyer
than your fucking lawyer

689
00:17:05,650 --> 00:17:06,630
come harbor.

690
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:09,470
Why?

691
00:17:09,470 --> 00:17:10,810
I should get an honorary degree.

692
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:13,041
Yeah.

693
00:17:13,041 --> 00:17:13,450
So,

694
00:17:13,450 --> 00:17:15,890
so I just told him to put it on the books,

695
00:17:15,891 --> 00:17:16,161
you know?

696
00:17:16,161 --> 00:17:17,420
Then the judge went through her thing.

697
00:17:17,450 --> 00:17:17,811
Oh No,

698
00:17:17,811 --> 00:17:18,541
Mr. Ross.

699
00:17:18,541 --> 00:17:19,970
It's not the way you said is.

700
00:17:19,971 --> 00:17:20,810
And I was like,

701
00:17:20,811 --> 00:17:21,380
can you,

702
00:17:21,380 --> 00:17:25,490
she must came read if she
can't read that she can't read.

703
00:17:25,940 --> 00:17:27,980
So then the prosecutor went
through his whole thing,

704
00:17:27,981 --> 00:17:32,060
but then I went to the Ninth Circuit
Court of Appeals and they agreed with me

705
00:17:32,061 --> 00:17:32,630
totally.

706
00:17:32,630 --> 00:17:32,990
You know,

707
00:17:32,990 --> 00:17:33,410
saying it,

708
00:17:33,410 --> 00:17:34,010
uh,

709
00:17:34,010 --> 00:17:34,461
if they,

710
00:17:34,461 --> 00:17:35,120
uh,

711
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:37,220
did it the way they were saying
do it that they would lock up,

712
00:17:37,221 --> 00:17:40,130
everybody would be career
criminals on their first arrest.

713
00:17:40,131 --> 00:17:40,964
So

714
00:17:40,970 --> 00:17:41,151
yeah.

715
00:17:41,151 --> 00:17:43,130
Literally everybody would be in life.

716
00:17:43,220 --> 00:17:44,260
Here I am life.

717
00:17:44,410 --> 00:17:45,500
Here I am.

718
00:17:45,890 --> 00:17:46,660
Wow.

719
00:17:46,660 --> 00:17:49,860
So nice sort of ninth
circuit court appeals.

720
00:17:49,980 --> 00:17:51,180
They agree with you,

721
00:17:51,450 --> 00:17:52,350
they side with you.

722
00:17:52,360 --> 00:17:52,471
Uh,

723
00:17:52,471 --> 00:17:53,520
you released immediately?

724
00:17:53,670 --> 00:17:53,911
No,

725
00:17:53,911 --> 00:17:55,380
and I had nine more years to do,

726
00:17:55,381 --> 00:17:55,860
man.

727
00:17:55,860 --> 00:17:57,420
Jesus Christ.

728
00:17:57,780 --> 00:17:58,860
Why nine more years?

729
00:17:59,470 --> 00:18:00,160
Uh,

730
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:01,260
that's just where it was.

731
00:18:01,261 --> 00:18:01,501
You know,

732
00:18:01,501 --> 00:18:02,670
that's how much time I had left.

733
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:05,670
So you had $20 cut me down.

734
00:18:05,700 --> 00:18:05,941
No,

735
00:18:05,941 --> 00:18:06,121
no.

736
00:18:06,121 --> 00:18:06,810
I had a life,

737
00:18:06,810 --> 00:18:08,100
but they took me down to 20.

738
00:18:08,550 --> 00:18:11,040
So the Ninth Circuit Court
of Appeals cut you down a 20.

739
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:12,480
Oh,

740
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:13,200
okay.

741
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:16,500
So at least you knew there was a light
at the end of the tunnel that right.

742
00:18:16,530 --> 00:18:18,120
So then we chose happy with that.

743
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:19,110
You were happy with that?

744
00:18:19,170 --> 00:18:19,380
Yeah,

745
00:18:19,380 --> 00:18:22,170
I was going to need a penitentiary
cause I was up in Lompoc penitentiary.

746
00:18:22,171 --> 00:18:23,890
You know USP Lompoc help.

747
00:18:23,970 --> 00:18:24,870
What does that place like?

748
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:25,681
Oh man,

749
00:18:25,681 --> 00:18:26,430
that's a dungeon.

750
00:18:26,430 --> 00:18:26,970
You know,

751
00:18:26,970 --> 00:18:28,710
everybody in here got 40 years of better.

752
00:18:29,870 --> 00:18:30,120
You know,

753
00:18:30,120 --> 00:18:30,980
they mad at you up there.

754
00:18:30,990 --> 00:18:31,950
If you got 20 you know,

755
00:18:31,951 --> 00:18:33,540
they got to get you out
of there with 20 years.

756
00:18:33,570 --> 00:18:34,740
You know something might happen to you.

757
00:18:34,980 --> 00:18:36,420
Really man.

758
00:18:36,421 --> 00:18:36,601
Yeah,

759
00:18:36,601 --> 00:18:40,440
those kinds of 28 years freedom you
want to years is you're almost free.

760
00:18:40,470 --> 00:18:40,951
Yeah.

761
00:18:40,951 --> 00:18:41,580
You gotta,

762
00:18:41,580 --> 00:18:43,350
you gotta walk on eggshells around here.

763
00:18:43,380 --> 00:18:45,630
If you have 28 you've got between a unit,

764
00:18:46,230 --> 00:18:46,940
you may have gone away.

765
00:18:46,940 --> 00:18:47,773
Me,

766
00:18:48,940 --> 00:18:49,800
I didn't talk to him.

767
00:18:49,830 --> 00:18:51,840
They were like mad at you
or they'd be mad at you.

768
00:18:51,841 --> 00:18:52,531
They're mad at you.

769
00:18:52,531 --> 00:18:53,520
If you only got 20 years.

770
00:18:53,550 --> 00:18:54,383
Yeah,

771
00:18:54,650 --> 00:18:54,840
that's,

772
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:55,501
you got 30 years.

773
00:18:55,501 --> 00:18:56,334
They might be mad.

774
00:18:56,460 --> 00:18:57,241
God Damn,

775
00:18:57,241 --> 00:18:58,170
that's hilarious.

776
00:18:58,620 --> 00:18:59,070
Hilarious.

777
00:18:59,070 --> 00:18:59,191
I mean,

778
00:18:59,191 --> 00:18:59,970
you can get hurt,

779
00:18:59,970 --> 00:19:02,430
you can get hurt then just
because you got 20 years.

780
00:19:03,390 --> 00:19:05,010
How did you stay out of danger?

781
00:19:05,550 --> 00:19:05,900
Well,

782
00:19:05,900 --> 00:19:06,150
uh,

783
00:19:06,150 --> 00:19:06,661
like I said,

784
00:19:06,661 --> 00:19:07,770
when I got my time cut,

785
00:19:07,771 --> 00:19:10,800
I only had to stay there like three
more months and I was out of there.

786
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:11,201
So it was,

787
00:19:11,201 --> 00:19:12,240
it was easy for me.

788
00:19:12,330 --> 00:19:13,770
And you know,

789
00:19:13,771 --> 00:19:16,380
I'm a well liked guy to jail.

790
00:19:16,460 --> 00:19:16,840
Yeah.

791
00:19:16,840 --> 00:19:17,011
Yeah.

792
00:19:17,011 --> 00:19:17,521
They liked me.

793
00:19:17,521 --> 00:19:20,610
Ans How was the prison
that you were in initially?

794
00:19:20,611 --> 00:19:22,110
The first prison before
they moved you out?

795
00:19:22,230 --> 00:19:22,621
Oh Man.

796
00:19:22,621 --> 00:19:25,710
I saw guys get hit in the
head with a on mock ringers.

797
00:19:26,370 --> 00:19:26,611
Iron.

798
00:19:26,611 --> 00:19:27,150
What?

799
00:19:27,150 --> 00:19:27,983
Mock ringers.

800
00:19:28,050 --> 00:19:28,990
Bomp ring ring.

801
00:19:28,991 --> 00:19:29,651
The mop outlet.

802
00:19:29,651 --> 00:19:30,720
It's this great big old thing.

803
00:19:30,721 --> 00:19:32,310
My way about 1520 pounds.

804
00:19:32,340 --> 00:19:33,060
Yeah.

805
00:19:33,060 --> 00:19:36,360
You know the guy sitting in his chair
and the guy walks up behind him and just

806
00:19:36,510 --> 00:19:37,770
smashes a score with it.

807
00:19:38,340 --> 00:19:39,173
I mean,

808
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:39,901
brutal,

809
00:19:39,901 --> 00:19:40,261
brutal,

810
00:19:40,261 --> 00:19:40,740
brutal,

811
00:19:40,740 --> 00:19:41,573
brutal site.

812
00:19:41,820 --> 00:19:45,840
I seen the guy get beat with a baseball
bat and aluminum baseball bat and to his

813
00:19:45,841 --> 00:19:46,890
head was like mush.

814
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:50,610
They had to helicopter him
out when the helicopter,

815
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:53,070
I think he had brain damage stolen.

816
00:19:53,370 --> 00:19:54,200
He didn't,

817
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:54,431
you know,

818
00:19:54,431 --> 00:19:55,290
it was a vegetable.

819
00:19:55,580 --> 00:19:56,010
Uh,

820
00:19:56,010 --> 00:19:57,570
I've seen guys get stabbed.

821
00:19:57,720 --> 00:19:58,560
You know what?

822
00:19:58,561 --> 00:19:59,394
I'm taking a shower.

823
00:19:59,410 --> 00:19:59,671
You know,

824
00:19:59,671 --> 00:20:00,660
you hear this loud noise,

825
00:20:00,661 --> 00:20:02,400
like just kept bumping
up against the wall.

826
00:20:02,430 --> 00:20:02,761
Boom,

827
00:20:02,761 --> 00:20:03,060
boom,

828
00:20:03,060 --> 00:20:03,271
boom.

829
00:20:03,271 --> 00:20:04,200
Really violently,

830
00:20:04,201 --> 00:20:04,501
you know,

831
00:20:04,501 --> 00:20:04,861
and you know,

832
00:20:04,861 --> 00:20:06,540
this is somebody's body,

833
00:20:06,541 --> 00:20:06,841
you know,

834
00:20:06,841 --> 00:20:09,060
like why would somebody be
hitting the wall this hard?

835
00:20:09,090 --> 00:20:09,923
You know?

836
00:20:10,410 --> 00:20:11,243
And uh,

837
00:20:12,230 --> 00:20:16,110
so I can wrap my towel up and I look my
head out the shower and I see this guy

838
00:20:16,111 --> 00:20:17,220
and this guy stabbing him.

839
00:20:17,580 --> 00:20:18,780
And so to get off tonight,

840
00:20:18,781 --> 00:20:22,500
he's just throwing this back and he hit
everything up against the wall trying to

841
00:20:22,501 --> 00:20:23,460
get away from the knife.

842
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:25,380
So it was really violent.

843
00:20:25,381 --> 00:20:25,800
I mean,

844
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:26,880
prison is really violent.

845
00:20:27,030 --> 00:20:27,330
You know,

846
00:20:27,330 --> 00:20:28,680
you have to be careful,

847
00:20:29,070 --> 00:20:29,970
especially in the USP,

848
00:20:30,750 --> 00:20:33,670
the USP or when the
loans are dangerous too,

849
00:20:33,671 --> 00:20:36,160
but not as dangerous as USP because
these guys don't have nothing to,

850
00:20:36,190 --> 00:20:38,100
what does the USP US penitentiary,

851
00:20:38,550 --> 00:20:39,180
penitentiary.

852
00:20:39,180 --> 00:20:40,013
What is the difference?

853
00:20:41,370 --> 00:20:42,203
Well,

854
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:43,831
say for instance,

855
00:20:43,831 --> 00:20:44,850
the FCI,

856
00:20:44,940 --> 00:20:49,460
you can't have more than 20 years and
be at Fci if you have more than 20.

857
00:20:49,461 --> 00:20:52,600
FCIS stands for a federal
correctional institution.

858
00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:54,160
That's like a medium.

859
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:55,660
Okay.

860
00:20:55,660 --> 00:20:57,210
So if you could have more than than,

861
00:20:57,211 --> 00:20:58,150
than than 20 years,

862
00:20:58,151 --> 00:20:59,410
you're going to go to a USP.

863
00:21:00,250 --> 00:21:00,551
Now,

864
00:21:00,551 --> 00:21:03,400
if you go to a FCI and
you've got 20 years,

865
00:21:03,401 --> 00:21:06,310
but you keep getting into trouble
fights and you know something,

866
00:21:06,311 --> 00:21:09,040
maybe you stabbed somebody and then
they're going to send you to a USP in the

867
00:21:09,070 --> 00:21:09,340
it.

868
00:21:09,340 --> 00:21:09,671
Okay,

869
00:21:09,671 --> 00:21:10,181
you go up here,

870
00:21:10,181 --> 00:21:11,620
these guys can handle stabbings.

871
00:21:12,310 --> 00:21:13,270
So they're there,

872
00:21:13,390 --> 00:21:15,930
they'll boost you up and then
they got what they call it,

873
00:21:15,931 --> 00:21:16,960
a low is for the guys.

874
00:21:16,961 --> 00:21:18,310
We've got like five years,

875
00:21:18,370 --> 00:21:19,210
six years.

876
00:21:19,530 --> 00:21:20,380
Then you go to a low.

877
00:21:20,650 --> 00:21:23,650
So they kind of keep it separated
like that by your violence,

878
00:21:24,340 --> 00:21:25,630
by how much you're getting in trouble,

879
00:21:25,660 --> 00:21:26,493
things like that.

880
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:30,310
So the USP is the most dangerous.

881
00:21:30,340 --> 00:21:33,160
That's the most absolutely
African murderers,

882
00:21:33,161 --> 00:21:34,450
life sentences.

883
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:36,650
And then they had guys from all over
the country safe and [inaudible],

884
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:37,790
Washington DC and,

885
00:21:37,850 --> 00:21:38,230
and,

886
00:21:38,230 --> 00:21:39,063
and uh,

887
00:21:39,910 --> 00:21:41,950
you been getting in
trouble in Washington DC.

888
00:21:41,980 --> 00:21:45,850
Then they shipped you down to
California to keep you out of trouble.

889
00:21:45,851 --> 00:21:46,091
And you know,

890
00:21:46,091 --> 00:21:47,650
some of those guys from DC or really,

891
00:21:47,651 --> 00:21:48,484
really violent.

892
00:21:48,940 --> 00:21:50,820
And what they do is they take all the bad,

893
00:21:50,830 --> 00:21:54,250
it's guys from all over the country
and they put them in u s sps.

894
00:21:54,670 --> 00:21:55,570
So you may have a,

895
00:21:55,590 --> 00:21:58,510
a thing where guys are
fighting over territory,

896
00:21:58,511 --> 00:21:59,440
like the TV,

897
00:21:59,950 --> 00:22:00,341
you know,

898
00:22:00,341 --> 00:22:03,550
like the DC guys or the
Philadelphia guys might say,

899
00:22:03,551 --> 00:22:03,761
man,

900
00:22:03,761 --> 00:22:05,230
we want to watch this program tonight,

901
00:22:05,260 --> 00:22:06,790
the Philadelphia 76 or the plans.

902
00:22:06,791 --> 00:22:10,240
So we want to watch Philadelphia 76 in
the night because you're always watching

903
00:22:10,241 --> 00:22:11,074
the Lakers.

904
00:22:11,170 --> 00:22:12,310
So that could cause a fight.

905
00:22:12,670 --> 00:22:13,080
You know,

906
00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:13,411
it's,

907
00:22:13,411 --> 00:22:14,740
it's of like territorial,

908
00:22:14,770 --> 00:22:15,191
you know,

909
00:22:15,191 --> 00:22:16,024
the way it works.

910
00:22:16,210 --> 00:22:18,180
Did you get an anti violent interaction?

911
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:19,180
Absolutely not.

912
00:22:19,270 --> 00:22:20,051
Absolutely not.

913
00:22:20,051 --> 00:22:21,190
I stayed in the law library.

914
00:22:21,560 --> 00:22:22,240
Really?

915
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:23,890
They don't come in a
law library and fight.

916
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:25,121
So how did you,

917
00:22:25,121 --> 00:22:26,590
that's how you avoided everything.

918
00:22:26,700 --> 00:22:27,530
Most of the time.

919
00:22:27,530 --> 00:22:30,550
And the only time I really
would put myself in a,

920
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:30,960
in,

921
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:31,291
in,

922
00:22:31,291 --> 00:22:34,260
in harm's way is when,

923
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:35,430
when football season,

924
00:22:35,431 --> 00:22:35,641
you know,

925
00:22:35,641 --> 00:22:38,070
I played flag football with the guys.

926
00:22:38,071 --> 00:22:39,390
I played basketball with them.

927
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:40,140
Uh,

928
00:22:40,140 --> 00:22:41,910
but I always had a mentality to,

929
00:22:41,970 --> 00:22:42,360
to,

930
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:45,180
to diffuse anything that
they'd ever happened.

931
00:22:45,181 --> 00:22:45,960
I wouldn't fight,

932
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:46,793
you know,

933
00:22:46,890 --> 00:22:50,160
if somebody filed me hard
on the basketball court,

934
00:22:50,190 --> 00:22:53,730
it was my fault because I put
myself on the basketball court.

935
00:22:54,210 --> 00:22:57,120
If I file somebody hard
on the basketball court,

936
00:22:57,121 --> 00:22:59,550
it was my fault because I filed anymore.

937
00:22:59,730 --> 00:23:03,270
So I would always apologize
to guys when I fired him hard.

938
00:23:03,271 --> 00:23:04,560
But that's just the type of person I am.

939
00:23:04,590 --> 00:23:05,220
You know,

940
00:23:05,220 --> 00:23:06,120
when I played basketball,

941
00:23:06,121 --> 00:23:07,110
I don't mean to hurt anybody,

942
00:23:07,111 --> 00:23:08,130
but sometimes I do,

943
00:23:08,190 --> 00:23:08,491
you know,

944
00:23:08,491 --> 00:23:09,450
I filed a lot,

945
00:23:10,170 --> 00:23:10,441
but,

946
00:23:10,441 --> 00:23:10,681
uh,

947
00:23:10,681 --> 00:23:11,090
um,

948
00:23:11,090 --> 00:23:11,280
I,

949
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:11,581
you know,

950
00:23:11,581 --> 00:23:12,414
I got along well,

951
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:12,751
you know,

952
00:23:12,751 --> 00:23:15,440
people respected me and I
show the utmost respect.

953
00:23:15,470 --> 00:23:16,050
Everybody.

954
00:23:16,050 --> 00:23:19,560
Did you have to align yourself
with any groups in prison?

955
00:23:19,750 --> 00:23:20,441
I didn't know.

956
00:23:20,441 --> 00:23:20,921
I didn't,

957
00:23:20,921 --> 00:23:25,921
even though I am adopted by most groups,

958
00:23:26,920 --> 00:23:27,161
you know,

959
00:23:27,161 --> 00:23:30,550
they adopt me most groups and
most of the groups in DL adopt me,

960
00:23:30,580 --> 00:23:30,970
you know,

961
00:23:30,970 --> 00:23:31,803
uh,

962
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:33,011
I mean everybody,

963
00:23:33,011 --> 00:23:33,341
you know,

964
00:23:33,341 --> 00:23:36,130
the Philadelphia guys
that decrypts the bloods,

965
00:23:36,740 --> 00:23:37,573
uh,

966
00:23:38,420 --> 00:23:39,430
the dcs,

967
00:23:39,460 --> 00:23:39,701
I mean,

968
00:23:39,701 --> 00:23:40,061
I'm cool.

969
00:23:40,061 --> 00:23:41,200
I'm just cold without all of them,

970
00:23:41,201 --> 00:23:41,980
you know.

971
00:23:41,980 --> 00:23:42,640
Uh,

972
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:45,740
the only one probably is not as as is is,

973
00:23:46,300 --> 00:23:47,133
um,

974
00:23:47,890 --> 00:23:48,650
what's that?

975
00:23:48,650 --> 00:23:52,220
Cerenia hose and ham brothers are
probably the only two groups that,

976
00:23:52,680 --> 00:23:53,451
but it's a certainty.

977
00:23:53,451 --> 00:23:57,480
I was Mexicans and then the Aaron
Brothers obviously kick your k dude.

978
00:23:57,490 --> 00:23:57,800
Yeah.

979
00:23:57,800 --> 00:23:58,040
Yeah.

980
00:23:58,040 --> 00:24:00,290
Other than that I got them
on and even they got it on,

981
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:00,531
you know,

982
00:24:00,531 --> 00:24:01,364
they would speak to me,

983
00:24:01,490 --> 00:24:01,970
you know,

984
00:24:01,970 --> 00:24:02,421
hey Rick,

985
00:24:02,421 --> 00:24:03,020
what's happening?

986
00:24:03,020 --> 00:24:03,500
But you know,

987
00:24:03,500 --> 00:24:06,210
we don't hang out but they
don't hang out with blacks

988
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:09,250
the day you got out of jail,

989
00:24:09,251 --> 00:24:09,790
man,

990
00:24:09,790 --> 00:24:14,350
what the fuck was that like the day you
get out of 20 years knowing that you got

991
00:24:14,351 --> 00:24:14,710
out,

992
00:24:14,710 --> 00:24:15,520
you know,

993
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:15,900
oh,

994
00:24:15,900 --> 00:24:17,190
hair by hair.

995
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:18,473
It was luck.

996
00:24:19,140 --> 00:24:19,511
Cause you know,

997
00:24:19,511 --> 00:24:20,161
it was guys,

998
00:24:20,161 --> 00:24:23,310
when I was in prison it was guys
who had the same issue I had.

999
00:24:24,030 --> 00:24:24,960
It didn't get out.

1000
00:24:25,560 --> 00:24:26,170
Wow.

1001
00:24:26,170 --> 00:24:27,960
They will argue that almost the same way.

1002
00:24:27,961 --> 00:24:28,451
You know,

1003
00:24:28,451 --> 00:24:29,191
a matter of fact,

1004
00:24:29,191 --> 00:24:32,640
we are trying to get the guy who was
the first guy to get a life sentence for

1005
00:24:32,700 --> 00:24:33,533
selling crack.

1006
00:24:33,690 --> 00:24:35,820
We tried to get his
interview and his issue was,

1007
00:24:35,870 --> 00:24:37,320
it was almost identical to mine.

1008
00:24:37,810 --> 00:24:38,880
Just a little different though,

1009
00:24:39,180 --> 00:24:40,050
but close.

1010
00:24:40,380 --> 00:24:40,841
And he's,

1011
00:24:40,841 --> 00:24:41,730
he's in for life.

1012
00:24:41,790 --> 00:24:42,481
He's in for life.

1013
00:24:42,481 --> 00:24:44,010
And he was only like 20 years old,

1014
00:24:44,011 --> 00:24:44,844
19 years old.

1015
00:24:46,220 --> 00:24:47,930
And it was the same situation.

1016
00:24:47,931 --> 00:24:50,080
They used the three strike rule
and here's the three strike rule.

1017
00:24:50,370 --> 00:24:50,870
But he had,

1018
00:24:50,870 --> 00:24:52,580
he didn't have three convictions,

1019
00:24:53,890 --> 00:24:55,360
his convictions and little different.

1020
00:24:55,361 --> 00:24:55,770
Right.

1021
00:24:55,770 --> 00:24:55,990
He,

1022
00:24:55,990 --> 00:24:56,191
he,

1023
00:24:56,191 --> 00:24:57,610
he did have convictions.

1024
00:24:58,210 --> 00:24:59,043
Uh,

1025
00:24:59,190 --> 00:24:59,690
he,

1026
00:24:59,690 --> 00:25:00,281
his was,

1027
00:25:00,281 --> 00:25:00,601
he,

1028
00:25:00,601 --> 00:25:02,470
he went to jail when he was 18 years old.

1029
00:25:03,750 --> 00:25:06,180
He got out and the same day he got out,

1030
00:25:06,181 --> 00:25:08,460
he went right back on the block
and started selling dope again.

1031
00:25:08,940 --> 00:25:10,200
And he got arrested that day.

1032
00:25:10,290 --> 00:25:11,580
So he wasn't convicted.

1033
00:25:12,910 --> 00:25:13,743
Okay.

1034
00:25:13,750 --> 00:25:16,870
It wasn't convicted of the first
one when he caught the second one.

1035
00:25:16,871 --> 00:25:18,970
But they said it don't
matter if he was convicted,

1036
00:25:19,420 --> 00:25:20,380
you had been to jail.

1037
00:25:20,381 --> 00:25:23,950
So you have learned your lesson and
you went back out and you did it again.

1038
00:25:24,210 --> 00:25:25,043
Uh,

1039
00:25:25,290 --> 00:25:26,230
there's gotta be a lot of that.

1040
00:25:26,260 --> 00:25:27,790
He was mad at me when I won.

1041
00:25:28,150 --> 00:25:28,720
Really?

1042
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:29,200
Yeah.

1043
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:30,670
And he's supposed to be my man too.

1044
00:25:30,671 --> 00:25:31,391
He was mad,

1045
00:25:31,391 --> 00:25:31,751
man.

1046
00:25:31,751 --> 00:25:32,111
How are you?

1047
00:25:32,111 --> 00:25:34,420
When I had the same issue.

1048
00:25:34,421 --> 00:25:34,691
I said,

1049
00:25:34,691 --> 00:25:34,841
no,

1050
00:25:34,841 --> 00:25:35,920
you as a little different.

1051
00:25:36,340 --> 00:25:36,490
See,

1052
00:25:36,490 --> 00:25:37,600
I never got out on mine.

1053
00:25:37,660 --> 00:25:38,530
See on mine,

1054
00:25:38,531 --> 00:25:39,310

1055
00:25:39,310 --> 00:25:39,760

1056
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:40,120
from,

1057
00:25:40,120 --> 00:25:40,721
from La.

1058
00:25:40,721 --> 00:25:42,820
They took me to Texas and took me to Ohio.

1059
00:25:43,570 --> 00:25:44,740
Took me to St Louis

1060
00:25:45,910 --> 00:25:46,760
all

1061
00:25:46,890 --> 00:25:48,570
before I ever got released.

1062
00:25:48,571 --> 00:25:49,650
I never got released.

1063
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:53,100
Now when you got out was
the first show he did.

1064
00:25:54,010 --> 00:25:54,870
Uh,

1065
00:25:56,850 --> 00:25:57,720

1066
00:25:57,721 --> 00:25:58,554

00:25:58,850 --> 00:25:59,850
Been a long time.

1068
00:26:01,210 --> 00:26:02,470
I went and got me some

1069
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:04,890

1070
00:26:05,140 --> 00:26:05,560
Nah,

1071
00:26:05,560 --> 00:26:05,781

1072
00:26:05,781 --> 00:26:06,300

1073
00:26:06,300 --> 00:26:07,133

00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:07,740

Yeah,

Okay.
