1
00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:02,913
Bitches.

2
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:03,873
Well we've tried,
we've tried other online interventions 

3
00:00:06,291 --> 00:00:08,600
too,
so I have my these youtube videos up,

4
00:00:08,601 --> 00:00:09,434
but we also designed.
I work with some corporations awhile 

5
00:00:12,551 --> 00:00:13,384
while back because I've done some 
consulting and I had designed tests to 

6
00:00:16,131 --> 00:00:21,110
help people hire better employees,
which I still do and in fact I work with

7
00:00:21,111 --> 00:00:21,944
this company up in California called the
founder institute and it's the world's 

8
00:00:24,711 --> 00:00:27,650
largest stage early technology company 
incubator.

9
00:00:27,651 --> 00:00:28,484
It's created 2,500
companies in the last four years and we 

10
00:00:31,191 --> 00:00:32,024
test now in 135 cities,
but when I was marketing these tests to 

11
00:00:36,831 --> 00:00:37,664
companies,
they kept asking me what could be done 

12
00:00:39,021 --> 00:00:41,960
about their poorer performing employees 
and I said,

13
00:00:41,961 --> 00:00:44,540
well,
I didn't know because it's not that easy

14
00:00:44,541 --> 00:00:47,060
to.
If you have someone who's problematic,

15
00:00:47,061 --> 00:00:47,894
who's troubled,
it's not that easy for a manager to 

16
00:00:49,041 --> 00:00:52,880
figure out how to straighten them out 
and they just don't have the time.

17
00:00:53,060 --> 00:00:53,893
They don't have the time.
They don't have the manpower and they 

18
00:00:55,191 --> 00:00:56,930
don't have the training usually to do 
that.

19
00:00:57,500 --> 00:00:58,333
But I designed to set of programs called
the self authoring suite and one of 

20
00:01:01,701 --> 00:01:02,534
them.
The future authoring program helps 

21
00:01:04,041 --> 00:01:04,874
people write out a plan for their life,
so it helps them to ask you some 

22
00:01:08,181 --> 00:01:10,250
questions about six dimensions of your 
life.

23
00:01:10,251 --> 00:01:11,840
You know your,
your health,

24
00:01:12,110 --> 00:01:14,330
mental and physical,
your use of drugs and alcohol,

25
00:01:14,660 --> 00:01:18,260
your wishes three to five years down the
road for intimate relationships,

26
00:01:18,261 --> 00:01:19,490
for family,
for career,

27
00:01:19,491 --> 00:01:20,810
for education,
and so on.

28
00:01:21,170 --> 00:01:22,003
It asks you,
what could your life be like three to 

29
00:01:23,751 --> 00:01:24,584
five years down the road?
If you set it up for you like you were 

30
00:01:26,961 --> 00:01:27,794
someone you were taking care of,
so it asks you those six questions that 

31
00:01:31,370 --> 00:01:36,320
it asks you to write for 15 minutes 
about about your vision for your life.

32
00:01:36,530 --> 00:01:38,870
You get to have what you want and what 
would be good for you.

33
00:01:39,110 --> 00:01:39,943
What would that be?
And then it asks you to write for 15 

34
00:01:42,321 --> 00:01:45,680
minutes about what your life would be 
like three to five years down the road.

35
00:01:45,681 --> 00:01:46,514
If you let your bad habits and your 
idiocies in your foolishness is in your 

36
00:01:49,731 --> 00:01:51,440
weaknesses,
take the upper hand in,

37
00:01:51,441 --> 00:01:53,840
Auger you into the ground because 
everyone knows about that.

38
00:01:53,841 --> 00:01:54,674
And so it's like you get to design the 
little heaven to strive for and little 

39
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:00,530
hell to avoid.
And then you write for.

40
00:02:00,930 --> 00:02:03,470
Then you basically turned that into an 
implementable plan.

41
00:02:03,471 --> 00:02:07,220
That's the second part of the program.
We've used that with about 5,005

42
00:02:07,221 --> 00:02:10,340
to 7,000
university students now mostly in Europe

43
00:02:10,341 --> 00:02:11,174
at the Rotterdam School of management.
And we've raised their grade point 

44
00:02:14,181 --> 00:02:15,014
average of their kids.
Twenty five percent drop their dropout 

45
00:02:16,941 --> 00:02:17,774
rate the same and it's had a walloping 
effect on men and on non Western ethnic 

46
00:02:22,281 --> 00:02:23,114
minorities,
it's moved the nonwestern ethnic 

47
00:02:25,041 --> 00:02:30,041
minority student population performance 
at Rotterdam,

48
00:02:30,231 --> 00:02:32,750
School of Management from 70 percent 
below the,

49
00:02:32,930 --> 00:02:36,900
the average to above the female Dutch,
uh,

50
00:02:36,980 --> 00:02:37,813
natives.

51
00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:40,850
And so the other reason I'm telling you 
this,

52
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:42,740
apart from the fact that it's a very 
good program.

53
00:02:42,741 --> 00:02:44,200
And um,
we,

54
00:02:44,610 --> 00:02:45,443
we did it at Mohawk college in Canada a 
year ago and we dropped their dropout 

55
00:02:48,741 --> 00:02:50,510
rate in the first semester,
50 percent,

56
00:02:50,780 --> 00:02:51,613
and that especially again worked well 
for men because men are at more risk of 

57
00:02:54,111 --> 00:02:54,944
dropping out now and,
and especially for men who didn't have 

58
00:02:56,601 --> 00:03:01,030
good grades in high school.
So not only is there the possibility for

59
00:03:01,330 --> 00:03:06,190
the net to provide tremendous 
dissemination of intellectual material,

60
00:03:06,191 --> 00:03:07,024
but there's also the possibility for the
net to provide dissemination of 

61
00:03:10,810 --> 00:03:11,643
psychological interventions that have 
major impacts on people's mental health 

62
00:03:14,981 --> 00:03:18,700
and productivity at almost at 
extraordinarily low cost.

63
00:03:19,030 --> 00:03:23,680
So that's really been fun too.
So why think providing some that sort of

64
00:03:23,681 --> 00:03:24,514
a structure and a framework,
giving people the tools just inform of 

65
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,290
asking them questions.

66
00:03:29,290 --> 00:03:32,050
What would you like to do is describe 
this,

67
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:34,480
what is your view?
And when you do that,

68
00:03:34,481 --> 00:03:35,314
you sort of allow them to help 
themselves outline what they would like 

69
00:03:38,531 --> 00:03:40,630
to accomplish,
which most people don't do.

70
00:03:40,870 --> 00:03:42,310
Well,
in our education system,

71
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:43,533
our education system was designed in 
Chicago in the late 18 hundreds to 

72
00:03:46,781 --> 00:03:47,614
produce factory workers because it was 
set up when when rural people were 

73
00:03:51,881 --> 00:03:54,370
migrating to the cities on mass because 
their kids,

74
00:03:54,371 --> 00:03:55,204
first of all,
we're likely to get factory jobs and 

75
00:03:56,381 --> 00:03:58,240
second of all,
if you were working in factory,

76
00:03:58,241 --> 00:03:59,074
your kids needed to be taken care of and
so the purpose of the schools was to 

77
00:04:01,991 --> 00:04:02,824
train factory workers,
which is why everyone's lined up in 

78
00:04:05,381 --> 00:04:07,480
rows,
rows and why there are bells.

79
00:04:07,481 --> 00:04:08,314
It's a factory model.
The problem with that is that now 

80
00:04:10,301 --> 00:04:13,300
people's careers basically have to be 
self determined,

81
00:04:13,301 --> 00:04:14,140
but that's never.

82
00:04:14,260 --> 00:04:16,180
That's never part of the education 
system.

83
00:04:16,450 --> 00:04:17,283
Part of the reason I developed these 
programs was because I realized this is 

84
00:04:20,141 --> 00:04:22,900
the same course where I'm teaching 
students that if they would have been in

85
00:04:23,350 --> 00:04:25,850
Germany in the 19 thirties,
they would have been Nazis.

86
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:27,353
I'm trying to get them to design their 
lives and it's way better to have 

87
00:04:32,141 --> 00:04:32,974
someone articulate their own plan.
You actually neurologically rewire 

88
00:04:36,881 --> 00:04:39,850
people by having them formulate their 
own thoughts,

89
00:04:39,851 --> 00:04:42,130
which is why you know,
your school teachers used to say,

90
00:04:42,131 --> 00:04:44,920
put it in your own words.
It's actually very good advice.

91
00:04:44,921 --> 00:04:45,754
If they would explain what that means.
It's like if you have to conjure up the 

92
00:04:48,731 --> 00:04:50,800
thoughts and you have to articulate 
them,

93
00:04:50,801 --> 00:04:53,500
then they change you.
And so.

94
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:57,360
Well,
and so this program has had the,

95
00:04:57,640 --> 00:04:58,570
the,
the,

96
00:04:58,930 --> 00:04:59,763
the effects have been absolutely 
overwhelming for us as researchers 

97
00:05:02,621 --> 00:05:03,454
because it's very,
very difficult to produce an 

98
00:05:04,901 --> 00:05:08,350
intervention that actually has a 
positive effect on people,

99
00:05:08,351 --> 00:05:09,400
you know,
you hope it does,

100
00:05:09,401 --> 00:05:11,110
but generally when you test it out,
it's like,

101
00:05:11,590 --> 00:05:13,330
no,
it doesn't do what you thought it did.

102
00:05:13,330 --> 00:05:15,160
Or sometimes it even has the reverse 
effect.

103
00:05:15,370 --> 00:05:16,480
That sounds fascinating.
Now,

104
00:05:16,481 --> 00:05:18,520
how do people have,
how can someone,

105
00:05:18,610 --> 00:05:22,510
a regular person have access to this?
It's called self authoring.

106
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:24,640
So that's s e l,
f authoring,

107
00:05:24,641 --> 00:05:25,870
like,
like writing a book,

108
00:05:25,871 --> 00:05:30,610
self authoring Dotcom and the programs I
gave away the future authoring program,

109
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:33,070
I think it might still be free.
Um,

110
00:05:33,190 --> 00:05:34,180
it was,
yeah,

111
00:05:34,181 --> 00:05:35,014
it is until the end of November.
I did a video called message to 

112
00:05:37,241 --> 00:05:41,410
millennials were because one of the 
things Jonathan Heit said about,

113
00:05:41,470 --> 00:05:44,110
uh,
he called Karl Marx,

114
00:05:44,111 --> 00:05:48,340
the patron saint of the social justice 
warriors and John Stuart Mill,

115
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:51,850
that patron saint of people say who 
stood for objective truth and freedom of

116
00:05:51,851 --> 00:05:54,130
expression.
And I thought that was really smart.

117
00:05:54,131 --> 00:05:54,964
He said Brown university is number one 
for social justice universities in 

118
00:05:58,581 --> 00:05:59,414
Chicago for truth universities.
But one of the things that marks has 

119
00:06:03,741 --> 00:06:04,574
over John Stuart mill is that mark's is 
a social revolutionary and young people 

120
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,220
like to think about ways to change the 
world.

121
00:06:10,250 --> 00:06:11,083
Right?
And that's actually a positive part of 

122
00:06:12,021 --> 00:06:12,854
their development.
It's a stage that the developmental 

123
00:06:14,631 --> 00:06:15,464
psychologist,
Sean Piaget called the messianic stage 

124
00:06:17,331 --> 00:06:19,310
and he associated that with late 
adolescence.

125
00:06:19,610 --> 00:06:20,443
So like,
while young people want to change the 

126
00:06:21,681 --> 00:06:22,850
world,
the problem is,

127
00:06:22,851 --> 00:06:27,050
is that that's been harnessed into 
attempts to change other people,

128
00:06:27,410 --> 00:06:29,600
but that isn't what you should do if you
want to change the world,

129
00:06:29,601 --> 00:06:30,434
you should change yourself.
And I don't mean that in some cliched 

130
00:06:32,211 --> 00:06:33,044
sense.
I mean it in the sense that Alexander 

131
00:06:35,750 --> 00:06:37,400
Solzhenitsyn said when he analyzed the 
Soviet Union,

132
00:06:37,401 --> 00:06:38,234
he said,
don't be thinking that the line that 

133
00:06:40,340 --> 00:06:43,940
divides good from evil runs down 
political spectrum or,

134
00:06:44,140 --> 00:06:46,070
or,
or countries or something like that.

135
00:06:46,071 --> 00:06:46,904
It runs down right down the middle of 
your soul and if you want to sort out 

136
00:06:50,361 --> 00:06:52,760
the world and what you do is you sort 
yourself out.

137
00:06:53,420 --> 00:06:55,100
It's a serious business,
right?

138
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:55,993
They say it's more difficult to rule 
yourself than to rule a city and that's 

139
00:06:58,821 --> 00:06:59,654
the truth because you're a complicated 
and there are horrible monsters inside 

140
00:07:02,931 --> 00:07:06,100
of you that needed to be tamed and to,
and to be brought in,

141
00:07:06,110 --> 00:07:10,610
to be brought into alignment and 
submission so that you can be a powerful

142
00:07:10,611 --> 00:07:11,444
and useful person.
And I gave away the future authoring 

143
00:07:14,811 --> 00:07:15,644
program as part of this video.
I made suggesting to millennials that 

144
00:07:18,741 --> 00:07:22,850
instead of rushing out there to change 
the world by changing other bad people,

145
00:07:22,851 --> 00:07:26,030
that they should look inward and sort 
themselves out properly.

146
00:07:26,031 --> 00:07:26,890
And,
um,

147
00:07:27,050 --> 00:07:29,090
I think we've given away about four or 
5,000

148
00:07:29,091 --> 00:07:33,020
of those programs so far.
It's about free till the end of November

149
00:07:33,021 --> 00:07:34,760
and then what happens with it?
Well,

150
00:07:34,761 --> 00:07:35,594
the self or the future authoring program
is regularly $14 and ninety five cents 

151
00:07:39,141 --> 00:07:41,420
and the whole self authoring suite which
involves.

152
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:42,553
It's a program that helps you write an 
autobiography so it helps you sort out 

153
00:07:44,991 --> 00:07:47,150
things about your past that are still 
burdening you.

154
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:51,170
You can tell a if,
if you have a memory that's more than 18

155
00:07:51,171 --> 00:07:52,004
months old approximately,
and when you pull that memory up to 

156
00:07:55,940 --> 00:07:57,770
mind,
if you still have an emotional reaction,

157
00:07:58,010 --> 00:08:01,970
that means you haven't fully articulated
the memory,

158
00:08:02,090 --> 00:08:04,790
you haven't analyzed it causally,
you haven't.

159
00:08:04,940 --> 00:08:05,773
You haven't freed yourself from its 
grasp and you're carrying it like a 

160
00:08:08,631 --> 00:08:09,464
weight and your brain responds to that 
like the more have more weight you're 

161
00:08:13,341 --> 00:08:18,230
carrying like that more baggage.
Let's say the more of the stress Hormone

162
00:08:18,230 --> 00:08:20,930
Cortisol your brain produces and 
cortisol makes you old.

163
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:25,100
Some of the work has been done by James 
Pennebaker at the University of Texas at

164
00:08:25,101 --> 00:08:25,934
Austin because he.
He started to pioneer these sorts of 

165
00:08:27,951 --> 00:08:32,330
writing programs and he found that if 
people wrote about uncertain things,

166
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:33,433
past,
present or future so they could be 

167
00:08:35,061 --> 00:08:36,650
traumatic things,
they could be uncertain,

168
00:08:36,651 --> 00:08:39,200
things that their physical health 
improved and he.

169
00:08:39,230 --> 00:08:43,790
He did a lot of detailed research trying
to figure out why that was and basically

170
00:08:43,791 --> 00:08:44,624
came down to the explanation that it was
something like an uncertainty reduction 

171
00:08:48,801 --> 00:08:49,634
mechanism at work.
Because your brain is always figuring 

172
00:08:51,321 --> 00:08:53,420
out how well situated are you in the 
world.

173
00:08:53,750 --> 00:08:56,850
How much do you not know to how much 
have you mastered?

174
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:58,920
And you can tell that you've mastered 
things.

175
00:08:58,921 --> 00:08:59,754
Because when you go somewhere and you 
act things turn out the way you want 

176
00:09:02,731 --> 00:09:05,010
them.
That's an indication of mastery and your

177
00:09:05,011 --> 00:09:05,844
brain is sort of keeping track across 
your whole life of how many places 

178
00:09:09,181 --> 00:09:11,490
you've been,
where things haven't worked out compared

179
00:09:11,491 --> 00:09:13,980
to how many places you have been,
where they have worked out.

180
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:17,790
And if all those places in your past 
where things haven't worked out,

181
00:09:17,791 --> 00:09:18,624
you need to map and master and that.
That decreases the existential load on 

182
00:09:25,051 --> 00:09:25,170
you.

183
00:09:25,170 --> 00:09:27,930
But that actually decreases your 
psychophysiological load,

184
00:09:27,990 --> 00:09:30,450
it makes you healthier,
it makes you less stress,

185
00:09:30,780 --> 00:09:34,770
and so we've put all that together in 
this self authoring suite to help people

186
00:09:34,771 --> 00:09:36,990
write about their past,
to sort it out in a,

187
00:09:37,140 --> 00:09:39,870
in a detailed autobiography,
it asks you questions about your past,

188
00:09:39,871 --> 00:09:40,704
it says,
divide your life up into six epochs and 

189
00:09:44,251 --> 00:09:46,150
then divide each of those that might be,
say,

190
00:09:46,151 --> 00:09:46,984
oh,
birth to kindergarten and then maybe 

191
00:09:48,241 --> 00:09:51,630
elementary school and then maybe junior 
high school however you want to do it.

192
00:09:51,930 --> 00:09:52,763
And then to write about the emotionally 
significant events in each of those 

193
00:09:56,520 --> 00:09:57,353
epochs and then to describe their 
effects on you and then to analyze how 

194
00:10:01,741 --> 00:10:04,290
you did in those situations,
what you might have done differently,

195
00:10:04,291 --> 00:10:07,710
what you might do differently in the 
future to straighten out your past.

196
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:08,873
And I've done that with my students in 
my maps of meaning class for about the 

197
00:10:11,131 --> 00:10:11,850
last 10 years.

198
00:10:11,850 --> 00:10:14,070
And some people have written 15,000
words.

199
00:10:14,370 --> 00:10:17,100
It's not that uncommon for students to 
write 15,000

200
00:10:17,101 --> 00:10:19,140
words and their autobiography.
Wow.

201
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:20,033
So that's such great advice.
That's such great advice about 

202
00:10:22,711 --> 00:10:23,544
reconciling with your past.
Because so many people just carry it 

203
00:10:25,261 --> 00:10:25,861
around.
Yeah,

204
00:10:25,861 --> 00:10:26,370
well,
if you're.

205
00:10:26,370 --> 00:10:27,203
If you're thinking about your past,
what it means is you haven't analyzed 

206
00:10:31,261 --> 00:10:33,330
the causal chains because you might say,
well,

207
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:36,000
why do you remember your past?
While you might say,

208
00:10:36,001 --> 00:10:36,834
well,
it's in order to have an objective 

209
00:10:38,460 --> 00:10:39,293
record of the past.
It's like it has nothing to do with 

210
00:10:40,441 --> 00:10:42,480
that.
There's only one reason you remember the

211
00:10:42,481 --> 00:10:45,540
past and that's to be prepared for the 
future.

212
00:10:46,170 --> 00:10:47,003
That's why you remember the past,
and so what you're supposed to do is 

213
00:10:49,530 --> 00:10:50,363
take the past and extract out from it.
Wisdom and wisdom is the ability to 

214
00:10:54,781 --> 00:10:59,100
avoid stumbling blindly into ditches,
and so you think,

215
00:10:59,101 --> 00:11:01,050
well,
here's a time in my past,

216
00:11:01,051 --> 00:11:01,884
I stumbled blindly into this horrible 
ditch and terrible things happened to 

217
00:11:04,591 --> 00:11:04,710
me.

218
00:11:04,710 --> 00:11:05,543
It's like,
okay,

219
00:11:05,970 --> 00:11:06,803
you need to take that apart.
You need to figure out how was it that 

220
00:11:09,630 --> 00:11:10,463
that events conspired with your 
participation voluntarily or 

221
00:11:14,431 --> 00:11:18,270
involuntarily so that that terrible 
consequences emerged.

222
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:19,133
You need to know why that happened and 
how you could react differently in that 

223
00:11:22,321 --> 00:11:24,270
situation.
And as soon as you do that,

224
00:11:25,260 --> 00:11:26,093
your brain will leave it alone.
You won't obsess you about it anymore 

225
00:11:28,140 --> 00:11:28,973
because the anxiety producing parts of 
your brain are basically trying to tell 

226
00:11:32,551 --> 00:11:34,830
you where there are obstacles in your 
environment.

227
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:35,753
It's like,
look out.

228
00:11:35,940 --> 00:11:37,440
Don't go there.
Don't go there.

229
00:11:37,710 --> 00:11:38,543
It's like,
well,

230
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:40,470
don't go there.
There's fire.

231
00:11:40,860 --> 00:11:43,140
Well,
maybe you could master the fire,

232
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:45,660
right?
Then you're a wielder of fire.

233
00:11:45,661 --> 00:11:46,494
You're not just a victim,
and lots of situations are dangerous or 

234
00:11:50,461 --> 00:11:52,860
not dangerous,
depending on your level of mastery,

235
00:11:52,900 --> 00:11:54,400
right?
Life is like that.

236
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:55,593
And so a negative emotion that's 
associated with a memory is something 

237
00:11:59,261 --> 00:12:03,250
that's crying out for mastery and 
writing can really help with that.

238
00:12:04,150 --> 00:12:07,690
So you're reorganizing your brain.
When you write autobiographically,

239
00:12:07,950 --> 00:12:10,570
you're,
you're basically the emotions.

240
00:12:11,140 --> 00:12:14,800
Imagine emotion memories can be stored 
at different levels of your brain,

241
00:12:14,810 --> 00:12:15,643
some sort of primordial reptilian image 
laden areas that are very emotional opt 

242
00:12:21,271 --> 00:12:25,390
to finally articulated plans for your 
future life.

243
00:12:25,690 --> 00:12:26,523
Will you want to take everything that's 
negative and emotional and transform 

244
00:12:30,611 --> 00:12:34,480
that into a fully articulated vision for
your future.

245
00:12:34,570 --> 00:12:35,403
And that frees you of your past.
You shouldn't be thinking about your 

246
00:12:37,811 --> 00:12:38,644
past.
I mean maybe if you're 80 and you know 

247
00:12:40,211 --> 00:12:42,790
you're going over a well spent life,
that's a whole different thing,

248
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:45,040
but if you're 30,
35 or 20,

249
00:12:45,041 --> 00:12:47,200
and most of the time you're thinking 
about your past,

250
00:12:47,201 --> 00:12:51,400
it's like it's like your soul is trapped
back there and you need to.

251
00:12:51,430 --> 00:12:52,263
You need to free it through 
investigation and the metaphysical 

252
00:12:54,461 --> 00:12:57,580
language is appropriate because that is 
in a sense what you're doing.

253
00:12:57,581 --> 00:12:58,414
You're trapped in the past.
It's like you've got to break free of 

254
00:13:00,221 --> 00:13:02,980
that so you can use all your resources 
to move ahead into the future.
