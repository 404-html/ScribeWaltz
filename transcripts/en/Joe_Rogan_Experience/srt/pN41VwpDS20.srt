1
00:00:01,630 --> 00:00:03,310
Five four,
three,

2
00:00:03,550 --> 00:00:04,780
two,
one

3
00:00:06,870 --> 00:00:09,220
funk.
Does that sound that everybody knows?

4
00:00:10,090 --> 00:00:12,250
Like if you play that sound,
people know that's an Arrow,

5
00:00:12,370 --> 00:00:13,370
right?
Yup.

6
00:00:14,610 --> 00:00:19,610
But it may be throwing knife,
but you known as an arrow.

7
00:00:20,890 --> 00:00:21,401
Dang.
Right.

8
00:00:21,401 --> 00:00:22,630
We do.
Dang right.

9
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:24,310
That's it.
That's an Iowa boy right there.

10
00:00:24,550 --> 00:00:27,880
That's the midwest coming out here.
Sometimes I hear you on your podcast and

11
00:00:27,881 --> 00:00:28,271
I'm like,
man,

12
00:00:28,271 --> 00:00:30,130
he is so midwest.
It's hilarious.

13
00:00:30,430 --> 00:00:31,000
Sorry about that.

14
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,860
That don't apologize.
It's awesome.

15
00:00:32,890 --> 00:00:36,640
I'm actually more of a half breed.
I'm a little bit of south,

16
00:00:36,641 --> 00:00:37,300
right?
Yeah.

17
00:00:37,300 --> 00:00:40,930
Yeah.
I was a redneck for awhile and then then

18
00:00:40,931 --> 00:00:43,000
became a Yankee.
My,

19
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:47,500
the people up north don't give a it.
They don't give a shit what people think

20
00:00:47,860 --> 00:00:49,170
north or South.
But this,

21
00:00:49,300 --> 00:00:51,100
the people from the south,
my family,

22
00:00:51,730 --> 00:00:53,290
they're like,
you're part Yankee now.

23
00:00:53,890 --> 00:00:54,730
Yeah.
Not Weird.

24
00:00:54,820 --> 00:00:56,260
It's a little weird.
They lost.

25
00:00:56,261 --> 00:00:59,140
That's why they lost the war thing.

26
00:00:59,530 --> 00:01:02,080
Can you imagine?
I mean,

27
00:01:02,140 --> 00:01:04,390
we are,
we're several generations removed.

28
00:01:04,450 --> 00:01:08,500
But imagine growing up in like the late
18 hundreds when it just happened and

29
00:01:08,501 --> 00:01:10,780
you're dealing with Yankees Samos,
my mom murders,

30
00:01:10,781 --> 00:01:13,240
right.
People Killed Northerners and

31
00:01:13,310 --> 00:01:15,850
northerners killed southerners.
And it must have been a lot of that.

32
00:01:15,910 --> 00:01:17,320
It was ruthless,
I'm sure.

33
00:01:17,380 --> 00:01:19,360
Oh,
how the fuck did that happen?

34
00:01:19,361 --> 00:01:21,940
That is a crazy time you think about
the,

35
00:01:21,950 --> 00:01:26,260
the history of this country that just
200 years ago we were in,

36
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:27,430
you know,
less.

37
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:30,640
We're in the middle of a bitter war from
the,

38
00:01:30,670 --> 00:01:35,410
the north versus the south Americans
fighting Americans to the death,

39
00:01:35,740 --> 00:01:39,060
big fields full of dead people.
Um,

40
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:42,910
my dad was at one of the fields,
I forget which field it was.

41
00:01:44,110 --> 00:01:46,090
Um,
but uh,

42
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:46,871
he said,
you know,

43
00:01:46,871 --> 00:01:49,780
it's one of those memorial places in the
south.

44
00:01:49,900 --> 00:01:51,880
And he said the feelings Berg or
something.

45
00:01:51,930 --> 00:01:54,970
Yeah.
Want it was Gettysburg and he sent you

46
00:01:54,971 --> 00:01:56,050
feel it.
He's like,

47
00:01:56,051 --> 00:01:57,550
you feel sadness then.
Yeah.

48
00:01:57,700 --> 00:01:59,200
So I get sound.
I know it sounds crazy.

49
00:01:59,201 --> 00:02:01,900
And he was saying,
I don't even believe in that stuff,

50
00:02:02,290 --> 00:02:03,850
but you feel it.
Like you're there and you're like,

51
00:02:03,851 --> 00:02:04,010
okay.

52
00:02:04,010 --> 00:02:07,250
Oh yeah.
We've been in a few memorials.

53
00:02:07,370 --> 00:02:11,450
Um,
a few memorials and a few big,

54
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:12,440
you know,
like,

55
00:02:12,590 --> 00:02:15,610
especially like military cemeteries.
Oh,

56
00:02:15,980 --> 00:02:16,850
you just,
uh,

57
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:19,700
you know another one.
I felt it like exactly what you're

58
00:02:19,701 --> 00:02:20,900
saying.
Um,

59
00:02:21,020 --> 00:02:23,520
I went to,
um,

60
00:02:23,660 --> 00:02:28,370
a historic part of custer where they
lost the battle and I walked the whole

61
00:02:28,371 --> 00:02:31,310
hill and everything.
You can feel it there.

62
00:02:31,430 --> 00:02:32,390
Wow.
What is that?

63
00:02:32,420 --> 00:02:34,160
Do you think there's like memory in
places?

64
00:02:34,161 --> 00:02:35,270
Hell yeah.
There is.

65
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:37,330
Yeah.
It probably is.

66
00:02:37,331 --> 00:02:39,730
Right.
I think there is probably an instinctive

67
00:02:39,731 --> 00:02:42,250
reason why people don't want to live in
a house where someone was murdered.

68
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:44,980
Yeah.
I don't want to live there.

69
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:47,740
I don't want to live there.
I could you like,

70
00:02:47,741 --> 00:02:50,020
um,
there's a house that Jon Benet Ramsey

71
00:02:50,021 --> 00:02:51,370
was killed in,
in Colorado.

72
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:53,920
They can't sell that fucking house.
Dude.

73
00:02:53,921 --> 00:02:54,754
I live there.

74
00:02:55,470 --> 00:02:56,303
Mm.

75
00:02:56,470 --> 00:02:58,930
Nine years ago,
eight years ago,

76
00:02:58,990 --> 00:03:00,100
somewhere on with them nine years

77
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:03,040
ago and they were selling it then they
still can't sell it.

78
00:03:03,041 --> 00:03:05,830
It's a beautiful house.
It's in a really nice neighborhood.

79
00:03:06,350 --> 00:03:08,170
Can't sell it.
They have changed the name of the

80
00:03:08,171 --> 00:03:09,490
street.
They changed the name of the street.

81
00:03:10,010 --> 00:03:11,770
Still can't sell it.
I'm not kidding.

82
00:03:12,550 --> 00:03:14,230
They just can't sell it.
It has it.

83
00:03:14,260 --> 00:03:18,580
Does it have like historical everybody's
terrible sightings and stuff or was it

84
00:03:18,581 --> 00:03:21,300
just the killing?
Just the killing and the hold.

85
00:03:21,510 --> 00:03:23,710
The darkness all behind it.
I mean that was one.

86
00:03:23,830 --> 00:03:25,750
It was just was,
it wasn't just a little girl died,

87
00:03:25,751 --> 00:03:29,620
but there's all this darkness.
She was sexually active.

88
00:03:29,910 --> 00:03:32,440
There was something going like someone
was probably molesting her,

89
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:34,840
someone in the family or someone else
who knows.

90
00:03:34,990 --> 00:03:36,670
They think someone in the family might
have killed her.

91
00:03:36,671 --> 00:03:39,340
They don't know who it was.
It's never been solved.

92
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:40,450
No one's ever been tried.

93
00:03:41,170 --> 00:03:42,610
It's a dark.
Yeah,

94
00:03:42,611 --> 00:03:44,230
I'm not moving there.
Fuck that.

95
00:03:44,231 --> 00:03:46,000
They can keep that,
keep that house.

96
00:03:46,030 --> 00:03:50,230
I think they should level that thing to
the ground and maybe even do something

97
00:03:50,231 --> 00:03:52,240
with the ground underneath it.
Scoop all that shit out.

98
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:56,020
Put some new dirt and I'm not kidding.
I'm not kidding.

99
00:03:56,590 --> 00:04:00,820
Like that might be the only way you're
going to throw that Mojo on though.

100
00:04:00,821 --> 00:04:03,370
You've got to put that term.
You got to put that dirt somewhere.

101
00:04:04,270 --> 00:04:06,310
Yeah,
he's worthy of taking it.

102
00:04:06,340 --> 00:04:07,420
Right.
Where would you put that dirt?

103
00:04:07,810 --> 00:04:10,600
You have to exercise it.
You'd have to build like the most

104
00:04:10,630 --> 00:04:15,280
awesome park for kids.
Like you'd have to turn that house into

105
00:04:15,281 --> 00:04:18,190
something positive.
I don't want to do anything for kids.

106
00:04:18,191 --> 00:04:20,290
They're for sure that would be bad
taste,

107
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:24,550
but you could always take that big scoop
and kind of put it in a freak party

108
00:04:24,940 --> 00:04:28,690
desert or something where people that
like ghosts and crap can go out there

109
00:04:28,691 --> 00:04:33,430
and play in it or camp on it or what he
likes little kid ghosts you want like

110
00:04:33,431 --> 00:04:35,740
some old man goes can tell you secrets.

111
00:04:36,940 --> 00:04:39,010
Have you ever seen it?
You think you've ever seen?

112
00:04:39,011 --> 00:04:39,641
He goes,
no,

113
00:04:39,641 --> 00:04:41,860
I do not.
Have you ever experienced something that

114
00:04:41,861 --> 00:04:44,530
was like super creepy that you know
what?

115
00:04:44,590 --> 00:04:49,000
A couple of my friends at the comedy
store have claimed to have seen ghosts

116
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:54,120
and claim to have seen things and I with
many of my friends that work there and

117
00:04:54,191 --> 00:04:56,470
comics and stuff,
we've gone upstairs to the belly room in

118
00:04:56,471 --> 00:04:58,490
the dark,
just freaked ourselves out and went and

119
00:04:58,630 --> 00:05:00,940
ran out of there.
Stoned out of her mind.

120
00:05:01,090 --> 00:05:02,290
I feel it.
We got to go.

121
00:05:03,110 --> 00:05:04,360
Well,
are you going into the main room at

122
00:05:04,361 --> 00:05:04,721
night?
You know,

123
00:05:04,721 --> 00:05:05,590
like,
give me a hug.

124
00:05:05,591 --> 00:05:06,970
Hold me.
Ah,

125
00:05:07,150 --> 00:05:08,490
I'm scared.
It's,

126
00:05:08,620 --> 00:05:10,000
it's a weird place,
man.

127
00:05:10,001 --> 00:05:14,290
People for sure been murdered there.
It was a bugsy Siegel's nightclub in the

128
00:05:14,291 --> 00:05:15,700
19.
What was it,

129
00:05:15,820 --> 00:05:17,380
the thirties or forties or some shit.

130
00:05:17,820 --> 00:05:19,780
It was Ciro's nightclub.
Yeah,

131
00:05:19,781 --> 00:05:21,980
there's definitely some Mojo there,
cal.

132
00:05:21,990 --> 00:05:23,110
Yeah,
for sure.

133
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:27,040
How do we get going down the pattern of
death?

134
00:05:27,070 --> 00:05:29,170
I mean,
all I do was write a werewolf and

135
00:05:30,450 --> 00:05:31,283
pictures.
Awesome.

136
00:05:31,510 --> 00:05:34,510
Go to my instagram.
John Dudley is riding the Werewolf.

137
00:05:34,511 --> 00:05:35,241
We were trying to figure out,
well,

138
00:05:35,241 --> 00:05:36,550
the wearables,
um,

139
00:05:36,580 --> 00:05:40,390
Patrick McGee made that Werewolf and it
comes in to pate pieces.

140
00:05:40,391 --> 00:05:42,880
You slide it out and ball.
Patrick Biggie has a new movie out.

141
00:05:42,881 --> 00:05:45,070
I should pump his new movie out.
If you're into,

142
00:05:45,430 --> 00:05:47,310
there it is.
See it.

143
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:49,960
Fuck you.
Fix your bed.

144
00:05:50,410 --> 00:05:51,760
Oh my God.
It's hilarious.

145
00:05:51,790 --> 00:05:54,190
It's got 5,000 likes already.
I put it up two minutes ago.

146
00:05:56,020 --> 00:05:57,920
That's such an awesome picture.
I know.

147
00:05:58,430 --> 00:05:59,930
Pat Mcgee,
the guy who made that,

148
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:01,250
uh,
just made a movie,

149
00:06:01,550 --> 00:06:04,850
a big foot movie.
It's called a primal scream,

150
00:06:05,180 --> 00:06:06,530
I think.
Isn't that what it's called?

151
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:07,880
It just came out.

152
00:06:08,030 --> 00:06:10,520
Is it a legit one or like a horror
movie?

153
00:06:10,820 --> 00:06:13,430
Oh yeah.
Put your monster.

154
00:06:13,770 --> 00:06:14,810
Okay.
Kellen people.

155
00:06:14,811 --> 00:06:16,730
I watched that Jack and people in the
woods.

156
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:17,750
I watch that.
Yeah.

157
00:06:17,751 --> 00:06:19,400
It got good reviews.
I hope it's good.

158
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:22,340
I love me a good big foot movie and
there's not a whole lot of them.

159
00:06:23,420 --> 00:06:25,850
I think we would've saw bigfoot a long
time ago.

160
00:06:26,050 --> 00:06:26,883
There's,
yeah,

161
00:06:26,900 --> 00:06:28,190
for sure.
I think,

162
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:29,930
but,
but um,

163
00:06:30,050 --> 00:06:33,380
what would you do if you actually ran
across one double lung,

164
00:06:34,050 --> 00:06:38,270
which you take the,
take the penalty double on proven point.

165
00:06:39,380 --> 00:06:42,530
No,
I would hope I'd have my camera on me,

166
00:06:42,531 --> 00:06:44,330
but then people would call me a fucking
liar.

167
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:46,850
That would be a bummer.
If you really saw big foot,

168
00:06:46,851 --> 00:06:47,671
you're like,
God damn it.

169
00:06:47,671 --> 00:06:50,330
He's real.
Never one's gonna think I'm crazy

170
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:52,880
because everybody that I know that
believes in big foot,

171
00:06:52,881 --> 00:06:53,300
I'm always looking.

172
00:06:53,300 --> 00:06:55,730
All right.
Everybody thinks they chart.

173
00:06:56,300 --> 00:06:58,200
Even if you've got a picture,
no one,

174
00:06:58,280 --> 00:06:59,220
no one's going to believe.
Yeah.

175
00:06:59,250 --> 00:07:03,020
Then you're going to meet all the good
faith that you've built up by being

176
00:07:03,021 --> 00:07:06,020
honest all these years,
people fuck that guy.

177
00:07:06,410 --> 00:07:09,440
He's full of Shit.
He faked a bigfoot sighting man.

178
00:07:10,370 --> 00:07:12,050
Yeah,
I wouldn't,

179
00:07:12,110 --> 00:07:13,730
I wouldn't shoot it.
Definitely not.

180
00:07:13,850 --> 00:07:16,850
But I think if it was real,
I really do believe that if it was real,

181
00:07:16,851 --> 00:07:17,870
this is the,
this is the,

182
00:07:17,871 --> 00:07:22,160
uh,
the trailer for Omar C and Pat Mcgee did

183
00:07:22,161 --> 00:07:27,161
this with a all special effects like
suits and shit and actual makeup and

184
00:07:28,161 --> 00:07:31,910
prosthetics and all the stuff that they
used in the old movies.

185
00:07:32,180 --> 00:07:34,010
Like he doesn't believe in that CGI
shit.

186
00:07:34,011 --> 00:07:36,260
And I think he's got a point at CGI
shit.

187
00:07:36,290 --> 00:07:37,910
It's just too,
it takes away.

188
00:07:38,090 --> 00:07:39,290
It does.
I mean,

189
00:07:39,890 --> 00:07:42,380
you look back at some of the movies that
scared,

190
00:07:43,020 --> 00:07:45,050
you know,
scared the hell out of you when you're a

191
00:07:45,051 --> 00:07:46,730
kid and you watch them down and you're
like,

192
00:07:46,910 --> 00:07:48,560
what the man did?

193
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:50,690
They,
it just seems so much more real.

194
00:07:50,691 --> 00:07:52,940
But if you watch something to where you
know it's fake,

195
00:07:52,970 --> 00:07:56,900
it's almost,
can't picture the fact that it's flesh

196
00:07:56,901 --> 00:07:57,770
and blood.
Right.

197
00:07:57,780 --> 00:07:59,330
And you need,
you don't feel it.

198
00:08:00,020 --> 00:08:02,090
Like there's some of those transformer
type movies.

199
00:08:02,210 --> 00:08:04,850
They're smashing buildings and like,
I know this isn't happening.

200
00:08:05,540 --> 00:08:08,540
Just you don't feel it.
It doesn't feel like a real explosion.

201
00:08:08,620 --> 00:08:11,510
It doesn't feel like a real robot.
Just feels like horseshit.

202
00:08:12,260 --> 00:08:13,850
Yeah,
but the Dyno bots pretty.

203
00:08:14,060 --> 00:08:15,680
They're pretty dope.
What's the Dyno Bot?

204
00:08:15,890 --> 00:08:19,500
It's a dinosaur version.
Is that one of the transformers and your

205
00:08:19,510 --> 00:08:20,330
years?
Well,

206
00:08:20,330 --> 00:08:24,980
schooled
robots and transformers were the bomb

207
00:08:24,981 --> 00:08:28,700
man when I was a kid.
That and a cabbage patch kids.

208
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:34,480
So it wasn't a crazy that that became,
that transformers became huge hit

209
00:08:35,451 --> 00:08:37,640
movies.
It was a dumb toy,

210
00:08:37,970 --> 00:08:38,870
right?
Yup.

211
00:08:39,020 --> 00:08:40,580
Was it originally a toy?
Yeah.

212
00:08:41,300 --> 00:08:43,560
Transformers.
They were cool and shouldn't say dumb

213
00:08:43,561 --> 00:08:44,630
toy.
If anyone's a collector,

214
00:08:44,631 --> 00:08:45,464
they're freaking out.
Right.

215
00:08:45,770 --> 00:08:46,970
Dumb to me.
How about that?

216
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,740
Yeah,
go bots and transformers.

217
00:08:48,741 --> 00:08:49,700
They were,
I mean,

218
00:08:49,790 --> 00:08:51,620
before that you had,
you know,

219
00:08:51,650 --> 00:08:54,080
army men Musselman.
You remember those?

220
00:08:54,140 --> 00:08:56,260
Those little pink muscle

221
00:08:56,270 --> 00:08:58,200
man?
They were all freaking jacked.

222
00:08:58,201 --> 00:09:00,210
You know what I remember?
I remember stretch Armstrong.

223
00:09:00,330 --> 00:09:01,830
Yeah,
home part.

224
00:09:02,850 --> 00:09:03,360
Okay.

225
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:05,640
Yeah.
They never made a movie out of him,

226
00:09:05,641 --> 00:09:07,170
did they?
My boy.

227
00:09:07,650 --> 00:09:10,670
What's funny is they didn't have,
they did have some of that stuff there.

228
00:09:10,671 --> 00:09:14,220
They are a little muscle.
Then there's something that looks really

229
00:09:14,221 --> 00:09:18,870
good about that.
They're all pink girl pink and those

230
00:09:18,871 --> 00:09:20,730
were pretty cool.
Just on a,

231
00:09:20,910 --> 00:09:23,130
just a roundabout gas.
How many dudes have stuffed those up

232
00:09:23,131 --> 00:09:26,310
their house?
Hundreds or thousands.

233
00:09:26,370 --> 00:09:27,990
I'd say thousands.
Thousands,

234
00:09:28,050 --> 00:09:29,110
right.
Thousands of people.

235
00:09:29,111 --> 00:09:31,350
I've had those in there as we're going
down that road already.

236
00:09:31,380 --> 00:09:32,610
Why not?
If you just,

237
00:09:35,060 --> 00:09:40,060
if we could pull out like a pullback,
you think of a teenage mutant Ninja

238
00:09:40,650 --> 00:09:41,071
Turtles,
right?

239
00:09:41,071 --> 00:09:44,100
Did not start off as a,
was that a comic book?

240
00:09:44,190 --> 00:09:45,490
It was a comic.
That was a comic book.

241
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:46,890
Yeah.
It wasn't a toy first.

242
00:09:47,570 --> 00:09:51,030
That's my boy.
He really got into,

243
00:09:51,090 --> 00:09:56,090
I don't know what it was,
but he had this Peter Pan doll and I

244
00:09:56,731 --> 00:09:59,370
think because he didn't have a brother
or sister,

245
00:10:00,270 --> 00:10:05,270
he would beat the shit out of this Peter
Pan doll and he wouldn't do it when

246
00:10:07,021 --> 00:10:07,980
everyone was there.

247
00:10:07,980 --> 00:10:09,590
But you know,
you as adults,

248
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:10,341
she of,
you know,

249
00:10:10,341 --> 00:10:13,770
you ended up coming around the corner to
see if they're okay or whatever.

250
00:10:13,771 --> 00:10:15,450
Maybe.
We went downstairs for a while and I

251
00:10:15,451 --> 00:10:19,440
come up there and I mean he's just got
his back to the door.

252
00:10:19,441 --> 00:10:24,060
Just fricking power drop in Peter Pan
just kicking this thing in the face

253
00:10:24,061 --> 00:10:28,130
punched in it.
I mean Sharon and I just laugh about it

254
00:10:28,140 --> 00:10:32,310
or like he doesn't do it with anyone
else who for whatever reason Peter Pan

255
00:10:32,330 --> 00:10:36,380
is just his little brother and he just
kicks the shit out of that sucker.

256
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:39,930
Peter Pan's his bitch.
What about Robin Hood?

257
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:45,960
There was a robin hood toys ever did
ever kids ever get a robin hood toy that

258
00:10:45,980 --> 00:10:48,210
we need a disney movie,
so I'm sure it got around now.

259
00:10:48,211 --> 00:10:49,920
But that was because of the story,
right?

260
00:10:50,070 --> 00:10:52,370
Robin had the Disney movie.
It was all because of the original rob.

261
00:10:52,371 --> 00:10:54,960
You story physical like action figures.
Were they popular?

262
00:10:54,961 --> 00:10:55,794
I don't think so.
Yeah,

263
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:58,020
I don't think so.
No.

264
00:10:58,021 --> 00:10:59,670
Maybe when that Kevin Costner movie came
out,

265
00:10:59,671 --> 00:11:01,810
they sold a few,
but I bet they didn't.

266
00:11:03,130 --> 00:11:05,100
I'd say a lot.
Maybe a few.

267
00:11:05,310 --> 00:11:08,820
I forgot that was a movie.
How bad was Kevin Costner's forum and

268
00:11:08,821 --> 00:11:09,860
that movie was it?
Okay.

269
00:11:10,350 --> 00:11:11,820
Um,
did you watch it and go,

270
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:12,830
Whoa,
I gotta go.

271
00:11:13,380 --> 00:11:15,180
It's like when I,
when I see bad karate movies,

272
00:11:15,181 --> 00:11:16,710
I'm like,
get the fuck right there.

273
00:11:17,100 --> 00:11:19,230
I Dunno.
L Elvis doing karate.

274
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:22,710
I watched that.
I sent you a text.

275
00:11:22,710 --> 00:11:25,680
I'm like,
I watched that so long.

276
00:11:25,770 --> 00:11:30,770
Kevin Costner and Christian Slater to
checkout that feather the feathering on

277
00:11:31,381 --> 00:11:33,000
the back of his hair.
Yeah.

278
00:11:33,001 --> 00:11:36,360
It was members from the duck feather was
like kind of kind of the style.

279
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:37,351
Yeah.
The feathering.

280
00:11:37,351 --> 00:11:39,570
The hearing somehow or another,
he got his hair feathered wise in the

281
00:11:39,571 --> 00:11:42,990
fucking forest.
Nottingham was perfect haircut.

282
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:44,310
He's got a soup.
Look at that.

283
00:11:44,311 --> 00:11:46,230
Come on man.
It's got a super cuts right down the

284
00:11:46,231 --> 00:11:48,070
street.
The fuck did you get that hair cut son?

285
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:50,820
You that haircut I got the other day.
Cost cutters.

286
00:11:50,910 --> 00:11:52,620
Look how they made arrowheads.
Is that real?

287
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:54,010
Is that really how they did it?
Yeah.

288
00:11:54,740 --> 00:11:56,650
It looks like he's pouring a full metal
one.

289
00:11:56,680 --> 00:11:57,610
Wow.
That's dope.

290
00:11:57,700 --> 00:11:59,720
Yeah.
They would melt it down and pour it in a

291
00:11:59,730 --> 00:12:03,520
cast thing out like a rocky mountain cut
throat or something.

292
00:12:05,260 --> 00:12:06,040
I'll look at his,
showing them,

293
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:08,740
making the arrows in the bows and shit.
Yep.

294
00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:10,980
Wow.
It's right there.

295
00:12:10,990 --> 00:12:12,230
He goes,
drive home in it.

296
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:15,550
How did they possibly know?
Did they use scales to figure out how

297
00:12:15,551 --> 00:12:17,450
much the arrows weighed back then it was
even a scallop.

298
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:19,870
No fucking guy on the right.
It's killing me.

299
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:22,930
That's about how everyone would shoot
with that equipment.

300
00:12:22,931 --> 00:12:25,530
Nowadays.
Morgan Freeman was asthma blood.

301
00:12:25,950 --> 00:12:30,950
Why in the fuck beyond the wormhole?
This is hilarious.

302
00:12:32,051 --> 00:12:34,840
This is so dumb.
I'm a Kevin Costner Fan.

303
00:12:34,841 --> 00:12:35,950
Don't get me wrong.
I'm not a hater,

304
00:12:35,951 --> 00:12:38,020
but damn Kevin costs has been in some
stinkers.

305
00:12:38,110 --> 00:12:39,130
Oh,
now they're getting better.

306
00:12:39,131 --> 00:12:39,970
Look.
Oh yeah,

307
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:44,550
they learned Little Robin had coaching.
It wasn't bad.

308
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:45,810
Good,
bad.

309
00:12:45,850 --> 00:12:47,050
Oh,
just split another one.

310
00:12:47,290 --> 00:12:49,450
Wow.
Look at his skills.

311
00:12:49,620 --> 00:12:50,530
See,
people don't understand.

312
00:12:50,531 --> 00:12:52,390
Splitting an Arrow is fucking stupid.

313
00:12:55,010 --> 00:12:57,680
It's costly.
It's not wise.

314
00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:00,590
Well,
at least there was no cgi in this for

315
00:13:00,591 --> 00:13:01,850
sure.
I mean,

316
00:13:02,180 --> 00:13:04,520
I licked the feather before you're
fired.

317
00:13:04,550 --> 00:13:07,100
Is he trying to curve it around it.
I don't know what he's doing.

318
00:13:07,220 --> 00:13:09,260
Why is he looking at,
he's going to cut the string.

319
00:13:10,180 --> 00:13:13,170
Let me this.
They got all the dramas killing me.

320
00:13:13,270 --> 00:13:15,500
Sincerely is saying I wasn't sure if it
was going to hit.

321
00:13:15,890 --> 00:13:18,380
The drama is killing me.
That's a slow ass heroine,

322
00:13:18,410 --> 00:13:19,170
right?
Yeah.

323
00:13:19,170 --> 00:13:20,600
How much,
I mean seconds.

324
00:13:21,980 --> 00:13:25,580
I don't know if you shot that and access
dear thanks.

325
00:13:25,581 --> 00:13:27,620
Just Steve would be like be on the other
island.

326
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:29,480
I've never seen anything like those
things.

327
00:13:30,270 --> 00:13:33,920
Um,
John and I hunted axis deer in Hawaii

328
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:38,480
where they were brought over.
I was reading as a like a gift to the

329
00:13:38,481 --> 00:13:41,660
king in the 18 hundreds hosted that
today actually.

330
00:13:42,140 --> 00:13:43,490
Yeah,
that's probably where I was reading it.

331
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:48,070
I'm pretty sure I knew it already,
but I think of it,

332
00:13:48,100 --> 00:13:50,330
that's exactly where I was reading it.
But they,

333
00:13:50,390 --> 00:13:52,970
I've never seen anything move as fast as
those things.

334
00:13:53,330 --> 00:13:56,900
Like you could shoot at one that's 40
yards away and by the time the Arrow

335
00:13:56,901 --> 00:13:58,010
gets there,
it's nowhere near it.

336
00:13:58,070 --> 00:13:59,630
It's like Chung.
Yeah.

337
00:13:59,631 --> 00:14:04,100
You need to load those fast twitch
muscles in a UFC fighter of today.

338
00:14:05,590 --> 00:14:07,880
Just be concussion city.
It'd be crazy.

339
00:14:07,881 --> 00:14:10,550
I've never just,
I've never seen an animal react to

340
00:14:10,551 --> 00:14:12,860
something so quick,
but it makes sense that they evolved

341
00:14:12,861 --> 00:14:15,110
around Tigers,
tigers and leopards.

342
00:14:16,580 --> 00:14:18,200
Fucking shit.
Roll the dice.

343
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:21,140
Imagine being tiger and Leopard
preferred food.

344
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:23,000
And that's the other thing about axis
deer.

345
00:14:23,210 --> 00:14:25,600
They are delicious.
Yup.

346
00:14:25,670 --> 00:14:27,500
Yeah.
Like one of the most delicious animals

347
00:14:27,501 --> 00:14:30,410
on the planet.
And obviously tigers must know this.

348
00:14:30,650 --> 00:14:32,590
Oh I bet they have to know it.
Yeah.

349
00:14:32,630 --> 00:14:37,010
I mean there has to be a correlation
between something that's extra fast and

350
00:14:37,011 --> 00:14:39,500
extra delicious.
I really think there is.

351
00:14:40,190 --> 00:14:43,040
Well does that make sense?
Not really.

352
00:14:43,041 --> 00:14:45,230
Right?
Because like I dunno what to eat a

353
00:14:45,231 --> 00:14:48,740
hummingbird probably tastes like shit.
I think a lot of it's their diet and how

354
00:14:48,741 --> 00:14:51,590
much they're actually having to move
too.

355
00:14:52,170 --> 00:14:54,080
Yeah.
Cause I think things that are running a

356
00:14:54,081 --> 00:14:57,560
lot like full speed,
it seems like the meat maybe isn't as

357
00:14:57,561 --> 00:14:59,720
tinder,
but it's hard to say.

358
00:15:00,050 --> 00:15:01,580
That's true.
Well.

359
00:15:01,730 --> 00:15:04,610
Um,
what I've found is that Chad ward

360
00:15:04,611 --> 00:15:06,680
method,
the your your friend whiskey bent

361
00:15:06,681 --> 00:15:09,350
barbecue,
he's changed the way I cook meat.

362
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:12,740
Um,
I do that here now and I use a meat

363
00:15:12,741 --> 00:15:13,820
thermometer.
Always.

364
00:15:13,940 --> 00:15:18,940
The only time I don't is when I um,
I will saute backstraps slices or steak

365
00:15:20,181 --> 00:15:23,630
slices in a frying pan,
like a cast iron grill.

366
00:15:23,631 --> 00:15:27,590
I'll put some butter and some garlic
salt and some cracked pepper and I'll

367
00:15:27,591 --> 00:15:29,870
just cook them pretty quick on a really
hot skillet.

368
00:15:29,990 --> 00:15:31,760
I like cooking like that too.
Yeah.

369
00:15:31,790 --> 00:15:34,670
But when I cook like a roast or
something like that or a thick piece of

370
00:15:34,671 --> 00:15:36,710
meat,
I always use Chad's method.

371
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:38,690
Yup.
It's a way to go get it,

372
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:40,010
get the internal temperature.

373
00:15:40,010 --> 00:15:44,390
I get it to around one 20 and then I
take it out and just sear the outside

374
00:15:44,391 --> 00:15:46,430
and the frying pan and let it sit for 10
minutes.

375
00:15:46,431 --> 00:15:49,310
And Oh,
one thing that a lot of people don't

376
00:15:49,311 --> 00:15:50,660
realize too,
um,

377
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:54,680
when it comes to cooking,
a really good roast or a steak or

378
00:15:54,681 --> 00:15:59,681
anything is I love having those soft
Yeti bags or the smaller cooler.

379
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:03,110
And I'll take the stuff and actually you
know,

380
00:16:03,130 --> 00:16:06,710
kind of wrap it up just slightly and
foiler but your paper and then put it in

381
00:16:06,711 --> 00:16:11,030
the cooler and let it actually stage in
there and you know,

382
00:16:11,031 --> 00:16:15,320
and just stage in that moisture while
I'm doing my vegetables cause it takes

383
00:16:15,321 --> 00:16:19,610
about 20 minutes to do vegetables and
then take it out right at the very end

384
00:16:19,611 --> 00:16:22,310
to do that reverse year.
Normally when I put it in there,

385
00:16:22,311 --> 00:16:24,170
it gives me time to get,
you know,

386
00:16:24,171 --> 00:16:27,410
a cast iron pan hot enough with the
butter to do reverse sear.

387
00:16:27,770 --> 00:16:29,810
So it's like really good for timing and
it,

388
00:16:29,870 --> 00:16:33,710
it really helps break down that that
protein a little bit and it just makes

389
00:16:33,711 --> 00:16:36,440
it that much more tender.
That's interesting because I was doing

390
00:16:36,441 --> 00:16:39,140
that for a while but I was doing it
after I did the seer.

391
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:42,320
I was,
I was taking it right from the grill and

392
00:16:42,321 --> 00:16:44,570
then I was searing it.
Like I'd have the Pan Ready,

393
00:16:44,900 --> 00:16:47,630
I'd see her right off the grill and then
I'd wrap it in foil and put it into yet.

394
00:16:47,660 --> 00:16:50,450
But then you don't get kind of that
crispness of this year,

395
00:16:50,451 --> 00:16:53,240
which he like were at,
because it stays moist until you're

396
00:16:53,241 --> 00:16:54,074
saying,
yeah,

397
00:16:54,130 --> 00:16:56,960
yeah.
Stage at first start your vege and then

398
00:16:56,961 --> 00:16:59,600
like you know,
probably two minutes before you feel

399
00:16:59,601 --> 00:17:01,130
like you're going to pull your
vegetables off.

400
00:17:01,700 --> 00:17:05,900
Just get that butter going in that cast
iron pan and then do your reverse here.

401
00:17:06,010 --> 00:17:08,900
You know you can do one side and then as
soon as you flip it,

402
00:17:08,901 --> 00:17:11,720
pull your veggies off the grill and
you're literally,

403
00:17:11,810 --> 00:17:14,810
you can go right back to the,
you know that one side,

404
00:17:14,811 --> 00:17:17,720
your reverse sear and take it off and
you're serving hot.

405
00:17:17,780 --> 00:17:20,690
Everything's done well.
That's one thing that I really give

406
00:17:20,691 --> 00:17:22,220
credit to.
Steve Rinella.

407
00:17:22,550 --> 00:17:26,270
Steve Rinella really got me interested
in wild game cooking.

408
00:17:26,300 --> 00:17:29,300
And then Hank Shaw,
who he had on his TV show who's a

409
00:17:29,690 --> 00:17:32,720
brilliant chef and he's gay,
he's got a couple of books out.

410
00:17:33,410 --> 00:17:37,340
One of them is buck,
Buck Moose I think,

411
00:17:37,341 --> 00:17:39,610
and then he's got another one duck moose
or something.

412
00:17:39,611 --> 00:17:42,110
So I had it sitting here for a while til
we moved everything off.

413
00:17:42,111 --> 00:17:43,790
This stable,
it's table gets so cluttered.

414
00:17:43,791 --> 00:17:46,930
I'm always trying to put,
everyone has always given me books and

415
00:17:46,940 --> 00:17:50,160
also there was just sitting here,
just got one.

416
00:17:50,590 --> 00:17:53,430
They're always just stacking up and I've
been meaning to give you this book.

417
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:56,130
Moose recipes and techniques for cooking
deer,

418
00:17:56,131 --> 00:17:57,900
elk,
and Moose by Hank Shaw.

419
00:17:57,930 --> 00:17:59,220
It's awesome.
It's really good.

420
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:01,170
I'd be no,
his book's really good too.

421
00:18:01,171 --> 00:18:04,290
He's got two of them.
Hunting and cooking wild game.

422
00:18:04,980 --> 00:18:09,980
I feel I'm so inferior to those guys
when it comes to cooking.

423
00:18:10,830 --> 00:18:14,260
Oh yeah.
But I almost liked the fact that that

424
00:18:14,340 --> 00:18:18,810
people really like my cooking or at
least the pictures and what I make,

425
00:18:18,811 --> 00:18:23,811
people are really into it because if
they knew that my knowledge of cooking

426
00:18:24,151 --> 00:18:26,760
wild game is so limited,
it's,

427
00:18:26,910 --> 00:18:30,060
it should be hope for anybody to be able
to cook that easy.

428
00:18:30,061 --> 00:18:32,850
Because I'm not those guys.
I mean,

429
00:18:32,851 --> 00:18:33,790
I think if,
you know,

430
00:18:33,830 --> 00:18:38,430
I would love to do that,
but I'm as simple as it gets when it

431
00:18:38,431 --> 00:18:40,470
comes to to grill and stuff.

432
00:18:40,660 --> 00:18:42,730
Yeah.
But I'm telling you there's an art to

433
00:18:42,731 --> 00:18:45,730
that simplicity.
Like just you describing your method

434
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:46,541
for,
you know,

435
00:18:46,541 --> 00:18:50,320
like letting it stage and then searing
it and what we learned from Chad when we

436
00:18:50,321 --> 00:18:51,900
cook that wild pig.
Yup.

437
00:18:52,150 --> 00:18:54,640
That was amazing.
That was so good.

438
00:18:54,850 --> 00:18:58,090
And I think there's,
there's something amazing in that

439
00:18:58,091 --> 00:19:00,730
simplicity because a lot of people fuck
that simplicity up.

440
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:03,730
Like that simplicity is a real common
one to screw up.

441
00:19:03,731 --> 00:19:07,120
People just overdo it or overcook it or
something goes wrong.

442
00:19:07,750 --> 00:19:11,740
But um,
Rinella really turned me on to all the

443
00:19:11,741 --> 00:19:15,580
various really fascinating dishes and he
had several episodes of his TV show

444
00:19:15,620 --> 00:19:17,980
mediator that are just dedicated to
cooking.

445
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:20,530
And I don't,
there's not a lot of hunting shows that

446
00:19:20,531 --> 00:19:23,050
ever have that.
It's always just about hunting and then

447
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:26,890
the shot of the animal getting shot and
then everybody's smiling and high five

448
00:19:26,950 --> 00:19:29,290
and that's it.
Roll credits when it's pretty much,

449
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:32,020
yeah,
60 70% of all those hunting shows and

450
00:19:32,021 --> 00:19:34,040
his really stands out because it's like,
hey,

451
00:19:34,140 --> 00:19:36,160
this guy's a real chef.
I mean,

452
00:19:36,161 --> 00:19:37,930
it's an amateur chef,
but he's a real chef.

453
00:19:37,931 --> 00:19:40,930
He knows a lot about cooking and he
makes these delicious meals and they're

454
00:19:40,931 --> 00:19:41,531
intricate.
It like,

455
00:19:41,531 --> 00:19:43,270
it makes us really cool.
Elk Meat Loaf,

456
00:19:43,410 --> 00:19:44,410
it was really good.

457
00:19:44,770 --> 00:19:47,020
I've never done anything with Steve.
We've,

458
00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:49,960
we've passed,
we've actually been within the same

459
00:19:49,961 --> 00:19:53,650
group of friends talking at times,
but we've never actually done something

460
00:19:53,651 --> 00:19:57,340
where we had to have a communication
just the two of us.

461
00:19:57,730 --> 00:19:58,690
But um,
yeah,

462
00:19:58,691 --> 00:20:00,550
he's a fascinating dude.
Very,

463
00:20:00,551 --> 00:20:02,500
very smart guy.
I would love to actually,

464
00:20:02,501 --> 00:20:07,150
I talked with a remi and uh,
I told Remy,

465
00:20:07,151 --> 00:20:09,800
I said I would love to do,
um,

466
00:20:10,150 --> 00:20:14,590
just a weekend getaway where we just go
back country and all you teach,

467
00:20:14,620 --> 00:20:15,510
you know,
just Kinda,

468
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:18,040
I want to just follow remy and see some
of his,

469
00:20:18,070 --> 00:20:19,390
you know,
just as natural,

470
00:20:19,391 --> 00:20:24,391
like camping and survival type skills
and then actually do an on the mounting

471
00:20:25,780 --> 00:20:29,530
coaching thing with Remi.
We were talking about doing a show where

472
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:34,920
I literally retrain his way of shooting
while he's retraining my way of back

473
00:20:36,311 --> 00:20:40,090
country hunting.
And literally he's doing his element.

474
00:20:40,091 --> 00:20:43,540
I'm doing mine and we're able to to just
do it in the middle of nowhere.

475
00:20:43,570 --> 00:20:44,710
That sounds cool.
Yeah,

476
00:20:44,711 --> 00:20:45,544
it'd be pretty fun.

477
00:20:45,570 --> 00:20:48,250
Well,
I'm really fascinated by what remi does

478
00:20:48,490 --> 00:20:51,400
and uh,
Tim Barnett and a bunch of those guys

479
00:20:51,790 --> 00:20:52,980
that have,
um,

480
00:20:54,100 --> 00:20:57,010
really taken up solo,
back hunt,

481
00:20:57,040 --> 00:21:02,040
back country hunting where they backpack
in and they'll go in 20 miles with a

482
00:21:02,531 --> 00:21:03,430
backpack.
I mean,

483
00:21:03,431 --> 00:21:05,210
obviously,
uh,

484
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:07,240
my favorite stories,
Adam Green tree,

485
00:21:07,241 --> 00:21:10,450
that fucking crazy bastard.
Our good friend Adam went all the way

486
00:21:10,930 --> 00:21:14,380
deep into the mountains of Colorado and
then again he went,

487
00:21:14,381 --> 00:21:16,120
came out for a bit and went to Idaho,
right?

488
00:21:16,140 --> 00:21:17,530
Yep.
And that's when he had all the Grizzly

489
00:21:17,531 --> 00:21:20,140
and counters,
but 28 days just living out of a

490
00:21:20,141 --> 00:21:24,040
backpack and putting his camp on its
back most of the nights and just

491
00:21:24,041 --> 00:21:27,700
carrying it around and just living
literally off your back.

492
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:31,120
And there's an art to that and remmy
doesn't just do that,

493
00:21:31,121 --> 00:21:33,160
but he also solo films,
everything,

494
00:21:33,700 --> 00:21:35,290
which is incredible.
Well that's,

495
00:21:35,470 --> 00:21:36,303
well,

496
00:21:36,340 --> 00:21:41,340
I don't solo back country hunt that I
definitely have really.

497
00:21:43,031 --> 00:21:46,480
Most of my tv show experience has all
been from cell filming.

498
00:21:46,540 --> 00:21:48,610
I mean,
I've been doing it 20 something years.

499
00:21:49,150 --> 00:21:51,730
A lot of what you saw for me,
it was all self filmed,

500
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:56,760
which a lot of people don't appreciate
how tough that really is until,

501
00:21:57,240 --> 00:21:59,080
yeah.
I mean it is hard.

502
00:21:59,290 --> 00:22:00,940
It's hard enough to,
uh,

503
00:22:01,180 --> 00:22:04,630
to hunt and be successful.
But to film it is like a whole

504
00:22:04,650 --> 00:22:05,810
Ooh,
new level.

505
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:07,370
Yeah.
Just to bring the cameras around with

506
00:22:07,371 --> 00:22:08,600
you.
And like with Remi,

507
00:22:08,630 --> 00:22:11,370
like if we're watching a show solo
hunter or timber nat,

508
00:22:11,380 --> 00:22:14,030
the other guy that's on each other
always like holding the tripod,

509
00:22:14,031 --> 00:22:17,120
running up the hill while they're also
holding a bow and setting it up and

510
00:22:17,121 --> 00:22:20,150
putting the camera in place and then
trying to draw back and trying to get

511
00:22:20,170 --> 00:22:22,260
the,
and move the camera because the deer's

512
00:22:22,261 --> 00:22:27,261
move in like Gopros helped a lot.
I'm just fascinated by the people that

513
00:22:29,001 --> 00:22:33,380
choose to go deep into the woods and
live by themselves and do it for long,

514
00:22:33,381 --> 00:22:35,240
long periods of time because it's,
um,

515
00:22:36,170 --> 00:22:40,550
it's,
it's a very interesting and solitary

516
00:22:40,551 --> 00:22:42,710
pursuit.
Like when you're out there,

517
00:22:43,370 --> 00:22:45,860
there's no TV,
there's no phones,

518
00:22:45,861 --> 00:22:48,200
there's just you,
you only,

519
00:22:48,201 --> 00:22:51,320
and a backpack and a little tent,
maybe a baby.

520
00:22:51,530 --> 00:22:55,010
You're sleeping under the stars and then
you get up in the morning and do it all

521
00:22:55,011 --> 00:22:56,420
over again.
And some of these guys do it for like

522
00:22:56,421 --> 00:22:57,860
20,
30 days at a time.

523
00:22:57,890 --> 00:22:58,723
It's crazy.

524
00:22:58,950 --> 00:23:00,690
It's hard for me to,
uh,

525
00:23:00,780 --> 00:23:05,780
I don't actually like to post.
I don't even if I'm out camping on a

526
00:23:06,601 --> 00:23:09,180
hunt,
I actually don't post when I'm doing

527
00:23:09,181 --> 00:23:13,680
that just because of those guys.
Out of respect for those guys,

528
00:23:13,710 --> 00:23:15,180
it's who really,
really,

529
00:23:15,181 --> 00:23:16,230
really,
I mean,

530
00:23:16,231 --> 00:23:17,280
honestly,
I,

531
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:21,420
I understand what they're doing and I
don't,

532
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:23,100
you know,
it's no different than,

533
00:23:23,550 --> 00:23:24,383
you know,
there's,

534
00:23:24,390 --> 00:23:29,330
there's people that post photos shooting
archery when,

535
00:23:29,450 --> 00:23:31,440
when,
when I look back and see how long

536
00:23:31,441 --> 00:23:32,770
they've really done it.
And you know,

537
00:23:33,270 --> 00:23:36,990
they build up a persona,
but there's also guys,

538
00:23:37,740 --> 00:23:39,510
there's guys that have done it twice as
long as me,

539
00:23:39,511 --> 00:23:42,030
but there's guys like me that have done,
you know,

540
00:23:42,210 --> 00:23:45,440
possibly millions of arrows.
Um,

541
00:23:45,441 --> 00:23:47,270
so it's,
it's hard to,

542
00:23:48,110 --> 00:23:51,100
to see people like make pretend to be
that.

543
00:23:51,410 --> 00:23:53,690
And I feel like I'm that guy.
If I,

544
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:58,580
if I post a picture of,
of me out in the back country in a Bibi,

545
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:04,960
it's not the same as seeing Adam posts a
picture and a bivy or remy or Rinella.

546
00:24:05,780 --> 00:24:07,620
We should explain a Bibi that people
don't know what it is.

547
00:24:07,950 --> 00:24:11,510
It's like a combination tent.
Sleeping bag.

548
00:24:11,540 --> 00:24:12,490
Yup.
Yeah.

549
00:24:12,510 --> 00:24:14,750
I mean it's like literally you can get,
yeah,

550
00:24:14,751 --> 00:24:18,360
you can stuff it in your bag,
go out and you're more or less a

551
00:24:18,370 --> 00:24:20,170
hunting.
Just lay it on the ground,

552
00:24:20,180 --> 00:24:22,700
sleeping on the ground.
You got some little bit of cover.

553
00:24:23,210 --> 00:24:25,550
Sometimes people bring pads,
sometimes the hard,

554
00:24:25,551 --> 00:24:28,010
hard hardcore dudes don't even bring
pads.

555
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:29,990
There you go.
That guy is shooting Alan Yang.

556
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:33,650
That's how I wake up.
Wake up and Oh,

557
00:24:33,651 --> 00:24:36,030
I hear an elk wake and bake.
Right.

558
00:24:37,670 --> 00:24:39,570
Breakfast is served.
Yeah.

559
00:24:39,620 --> 00:24:42,470
Well that's crazy.
He's all got Cammo on the Bibi too.

560
00:24:42,560 --> 00:24:44,440
Can you appreciate that though?
Yeah,

561
00:24:44,450 --> 00:24:47,270
I feel that way.
It's not just in the hunting world.

562
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:50,390
It's like that with a lot of things.
Um,

563
00:24:50,510 --> 00:24:52,090
but you know why?
If I have a truck,

564
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:54,680
I have trouble posting pictures working
out.

565
00:24:55,490 --> 00:24:56,470
I know what you mean.
Yeah.

566
00:24:56,600 --> 00:24:59,870
Like I'll,
I make sure I make sure people that are

567
00:24:59,871 --> 00:25:04,580
following me and trying to maybe be
motivated by what my daily routine is.

568
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:08,450
I like them to see that I'm going and
things like that.

569
00:25:08,451 --> 00:25:13,451
But to actually post that I'm doing it
because I do it to stay healthy.

570
00:25:13,790 --> 00:25:15,710
It's not my life.
Right.

571
00:25:15,740 --> 00:25:19,640
And archery is my life.
So that's why sometimes it gets hard for

572
00:25:19,641 --> 00:25:23,060
me when people are pretending to do that
or,

573
00:25:23,330 --> 00:25:25,100
you know,
and I guess I don't have a problem with

574
00:25:25,101 --> 00:25:28,190
people doing it,
but I don't want him to do it.

575
00:25:28,220 --> 00:25:30,110
But yeah,
I don't want to be enthusiastic about

576
00:25:30,111 --> 00:25:30,944
it,
but I know what you're saying.

577
00:25:31,010 --> 00:25:32,450
Yeah.
I just,

578
00:25:32,750 --> 00:25:37,700
I'm trying to show respect for the
people that are literally putting in the

579
00:25:37,701 --> 00:25:42,701
grind for those specific things.
The same as what I have done with my

580
00:25:43,101 --> 00:25:45,500
life or archery.
That's all I'm saying.

581
00:25:45,530 --> 00:25:46,220
I know.
Exactly,

582
00:25:46,220 --> 00:25:47,053
Sam.
It's like,

583
00:25:47,080 --> 00:25:48,940
uh,
I dunno.

584
00:25:48,950 --> 00:25:51,020
I have a different attitude about that
with standup comedy.

585
00:25:51,830 --> 00:25:52,600
Um,

586
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:54,760
cause I really,
really like when new people get into

587
00:25:54,761 --> 00:25:57,760
standup comedy and it's,
that's contrary to like how a lot of

588
00:25:57,761 --> 00:26:00,040
professionals feel.
Like I was talking to a friend of mine

589
00:26:00,041 --> 00:26:02,350
the other day,
she's very funny and she was telling me

590
00:26:02,351 --> 00:26:05,800
that her uncle was a thinking about
getting into comedy and she was like,

591
00:26:05,830 --> 00:26:08,500
oh well,
Oh God,

592
00:26:08,501 --> 00:26:09,670
no.
You know.

593
00:26:09,671 --> 00:26:12,670
But when people ask me like,
hey man,

594
00:26:12,671 --> 00:26:13,870
I'm thinking about doing comedy,
I'm like,

595
00:26:13,871 --> 00:26:15,670
you could do it.
Anybody can do it.

596
00:26:15,671 --> 00:26:17,440
Just figure it out.
It's just like everything else.

597
00:26:17,710 --> 00:26:20,620
It's like Jujitsu or

598
00:26:21,260 --> 00:26:22,093
mm.

599
00:26:22,100 --> 00:26:24,170
Martial arts like fit,
fill in the blank.

600
00:26:24,171 --> 00:26:26,480
It's anything else.
It's like music.

601
00:26:26,510 --> 00:26:28,670
You learn the chords.
You figured out how to play,

602
00:26:28,700 --> 00:26:30,800
you can do it.
You might not be able to do it,

603
00:26:31,280 --> 00:26:34,220
but that might be on you.
I mean like whether or not,

604
00:26:34,260 --> 00:26:38,810
I think if you're a rational person,
he thinks and you like comedy and people

605
00:26:38,811 --> 00:26:40,250
laugh at you.
Like you say funny shit.

606
00:26:40,251 --> 00:26:42,920
Sometimes you can be a stand up,
will you?

607
00:26:43,230 --> 00:26:45,150
Will you do it?
I don't know.

608
00:26:45,270 --> 00:26:47,310
People think it's a lot easier than it
is.

609
00:26:47,460 --> 00:26:49,230
They don't really know.
They don't see,

610
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:52,350
um,
there's no way you could.

611
00:26:52,500 --> 00:26:54,390
There's no,
I mean you think about all the hours,

612
00:26:54,780 --> 00:26:56,490
all the time,
all the different sets.

613
00:26:56,491 --> 00:27:00,270
But I like it when people get into it.
So if some new kid has only been doing

614
00:27:00,271 --> 00:27:02,400
comedy for three weeks,
throws a bunch of pictures on his

615
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:04,800
instagram page about going to an open
mic,

616
00:27:04,801 --> 00:27:05,634
died,
I'm happy.

617
00:27:05,790 --> 00:27:07,050
Like go get it kid.

618
00:27:07,580 --> 00:27:10,160
Well,
I mean especially when it comes to art

619
00:27:10,161 --> 00:27:11,870
form,
there's kind of a line there.

620
00:27:11,871 --> 00:27:14,390
Cause when it comes to competition,
I'm very,

621
00:27:14,391 --> 00:27:19,391
very
active in getting people involved with

622
00:27:19,941 --> 00:27:23,120
trying to compete because I always felt
like even as a coach,

623
00:27:23,570 --> 00:27:28,040
when I helped people that were maybe not
up to the rank that I was,

624
00:27:28,310 --> 00:27:32,150
I felt like once I felt the pressure of
them pushing on my heels,

625
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:36,200
it always elevated my game for sure.
And I've got friends that,

626
00:27:36,650 --> 00:27:41,090
I've got friends that are within
different fields that I'm in.

627
00:27:41,270 --> 00:27:44,030
And they actually have came to me and
said,

628
00:27:44,390 --> 00:27:46,340
hey,
we want to show you exactly how we're

629
00:27:46,341 --> 00:27:47,870
doing this.
Um,

630
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:53,320
and in a way I'm a competitor because
I'm in the outdoor business,

631
00:27:54,380 --> 00:27:57,500
but there's been a few times where some
of my friends have said,

632
00:27:57,501 --> 00:28:02,480
the reason we're telling you exactly how
we do it is because we know that you're

633
00:28:02,481 --> 00:28:05,210
going to do it different,
but maybe a little bit better.

634
00:28:05,270 --> 00:28:07,550
And some of them have said,
we're stale right now.

635
00:28:07,551 --> 00:28:11,780
We know we're stale,
we need to push and we need someone to

636
00:28:11,781 --> 00:28:16,030
like push past us.
So that will our competitive drive

637
00:28:16,031 --> 00:28:17,330
we'll,
we'll push through.

638
00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:18,220
Well you know what,

639
00:28:18,220 --> 00:28:21,630
in the outdoor business,
but I'm going to steal a page from my

640
00:28:21,631 --> 00:28:24,930
friend Sturgis book.
Not a real book,

641
00:28:24,931 --> 00:28:26,460
but we said the other day,
he's like,

642
00:28:26,700 --> 00:28:28,500
he goes,
I'm not really in the music business.

643
00:28:28,501 --> 00:28:31,230
I'm in the sturgill Simpson business.
And I was like,

644
00:28:31,231 --> 00:28:33,690
damn,
that's right.

645
00:28:33,691 --> 00:28:36,480
He's right because I'm not in show
business.

646
00:28:36,540 --> 00:28:38,370
Yup.
I'm in the Joe Rogan business.

647
00:28:38,460 --> 00:28:41,460
100% like,
I mean I'm in show business in terms of

648
00:28:41,461 --> 00:28:44,070
like,
I guess I work for the UFC,

649
00:28:44,610 --> 00:28:46,040
that's show business.
I,

650
00:28:46,041 --> 00:28:47,700
I show up at the comedy store that's
show business.

651
00:28:47,701 --> 00:28:49,080
But that's where,
that's my gym.

652
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:50,880
Yeah.
That's where I'm practicing to be in the

653
00:28:50,881 --> 00:28:53,790
Joe Rogan business.
And you're in the John Dudley business,

654
00:28:53,940 --> 00:28:57,780
you know,
I mean what I was saying before,

655
00:28:57,781 --> 00:29:00,030
I wanted to let you continue your
thought,

656
00:29:00,031 --> 00:29:04,320
but what I wanted to say was the you
feel that way because you're a legit

657
00:29:04,321 --> 00:29:05,130
guy.

658
00:29:05,130 --> 00:29:08,370
Cause like what you've done,
like a lot of people don't realize

659
00:29:08,700 --> 00:29:11,880
there's a lot of people in the archery
world and there's a lot of people in the

660
00:29:11,881 --> 00:29:15,210
bow hunting world to talk about bow
hunting and they were really into our

661
00:29:15,211 --> 00:29:19,170
tree.
But your background as a competitive

662
00:29:19,171 --> 00:29:21,690
archer is just insane.
I mean you really,

663
00:29:21,691 --> 00:29:22,800
like,
most people don't even know,

664
00:29:23,010 --> 00:29:25,800
like you really did it all over the
world.

665
00:29:25,860 --> 00:29:29,130
I mean you compete internationally,
you flew millions of miles.

666
00:29:29,131 --> 00:29:31,520
I mean that you did the whole deal and
it,

667
00:29:31,770 --> 00:29:36,660
it's something that you,
because of the fact that you know,

668
00:29:36,661 --> 00:29:40,950
you put so much effort and so much hard
work into it and you're solidified as

669
00:29:41,620 --> 00:29:44,920
100% legit,
you're very sensitive to things that

670
00:29:44,921 --> 00:29:48,160
you're not legit in.
So that's why you're a very authentic

671
00:29:48,161 --> 00:29:50,170
person.
Like when you're thinking about like all

672
00:29:50,171 --> 00:29:52,480
the running,
like when I post pictures of running,

673
00:29:52,510 --> 00:29:54,130
I often think like,
yeah,

674
00:29:54,131 --> 00:29:56,530
I'm running but I don't even have like a
real job.

675
00:29:56,790 --> 00:29:59,170
Cam hanes is out there,
rode 25 miles a day,

676
00:29:59,171 --> 00:30:01,450
that fucking crazy ass and he's one of
my best friends.

677
00:30:01,690 --> 00:30:05,350
It's like I can't really,
I can't really think that I'm really

678
00:30:05,351 --> 00:30:06,820
run.
I mean I know I'm doing it,

679
00:30:06,821 --> 00:30:08,110
but it's bitch ass running.

680
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:11,390
I didn't want to use that example,
but to do an example,

681
00:30:11,420 --> 00:30:13,860
that is the perfect example because
yeah,

682
00:30:13,970 --> 00:30:17,900
I don't post pictures of me.
Yesterday I actually did arm day.

683
00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:21,980
I'm not like arm day all the time,
but yesterday was,

684
00:30:22,310 --> 00:30:27,310
let me have some of that Alpha brain.
Yesterday was a legitimate arm day and I

685
00:30:27,651 --> 00:30:32,360
thought
Cam's already posts arm day and he does

686
00:30:32,361 --> 00:30:34,460
it every day.
So yeah,

687
00:30:34,461 --> 00:30:36,330
I don't know.
I know he doesn't get tendinitis.

688
00:30:37,230 --> 00:30:37,941
No,
cause I'm going,

689
00:30:37,941 --> 00:30:40,130
he's down this dude,
I don't know.

690
00:30:40,131 --> 00:30:42,140
Why doesn't he have a tendonitis in his
legs?

691
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:43,210
That's true.
Runs it.

692
00:30:43,490 --> 00:30:45,950
He's we,
you and I talked about,

693
00:30:46,730 --> 00:30:51,020
I've shot a right handed Bo my entire,
well I shouldn't say my entire life when

694
00:30:51,021 --> 00:30:52,710
I hurt my shoulder,
I had to shoot a left hand,

695
00:30:52,711 --> 00:30:54,800
a bow.
But um,

696
00:30:55,640 --> 00:30:58,070
for the most part I've shot a right
handed boat my whole life.

697
00:30:58,070 --> 00:30:59,600
So my,
my left,

698
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:03,410
I mean my left Pec is bigger than my,
than my right.

699
00:31:03,830 --> 00:31:05,120
My left jelled.
Yeah,

700
00:31:05,121 --> 00:31:08,180
my left tricep.
And then on my right side,

701
00:31:08,300 --> 00:31:12,380
my right trap,
the way my whole right side sits in my

702
00:31:12,381 --> 00:31:17,180
bicep or also from pulling a boat my
entire life.

703
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:20,150
And you and I talked about,
you know,

704
00:31:20,270 --> 00:31:23,120
if you really wanted to balance yourself
and stay symmetrical,

705
00:31:23,121 --> 00:31:26,360
you almost need to shoot lefthanded as
much as you shoot right hand.

706
00:31:26,361 --> 00:31:28,280
Yeah.
Well that's the key with martial arts.

707
00:31:28,520 --> 00:31:31,310
But in a way,
I mean that is what Cam's doing.

708
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,850
He's running right?
It's all lower body.

709
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:39,410
And then he's literally lifting upper
body every day,

710
00:31:39,470 --> 00:31:42,470
which is a balance.
I mean,

711
00:31:42,471 --> 00:31:44,600
people are going to,
people are definitely going to say,

712
00:31:44,601 --> 00:31:46,040
well you can't train up her body every
day,

713
00:31:46,041 --> 00:31:49,460
but he trains lower body every day.
So is it like,

714
00:31:49,461 --> 00:31:50,540
I've thought that many times

715
00:31:51,510 --> 00:31:53,340
low weight,
high reps,

716
00:31:53,460 --> 00:31:55,320
not always so low either.
By the way.

717
00:31:55,321 --> 00:31:58,440
That kind of strong as fuck.
Like you'd be kind of stunned and how

718
00:31:58,450 --> 00:32:01,030
strong he is.
Like he came over here and uh,

719
00:32:01,080 --> 00:32:04,710
he picked up my hundred and 25 pound
dumbbells and he was doing presses.

720
00:32:04,860 --> 00:32:07,890
So he's pressing to 50 with dumbbells,
you know,

721
00:32:07,891 --> 00:32:08,724
and he's,

722
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:10,233
it mean

723
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:12,080
is it,
he's a crazy guy.

724
00:32:12,290 --> 00:32:14,600
Like I don't know anybody like him.
So like he's doing,

725
00:32:14,660 --> 00:32:17,090
he's doing low weight,
high rep running.

726
00:32:17,270 --> 00:32:20,330
He's doing that.
But I'm saying he also lifts to 50 with

727
00:32:20,331 --> 00:32:23,480
dumbbells and he only weighs like 175
pounds.

728
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:25,010
I mean,
it's pretty crazy shit.

729
00:32:25,280 --> 00:32:28,850
He's a felon at one 75 and I'm two 25.
He's a tank.

730
00:32:29,820 --> 00:32:32,900
He's a madman.
Like I've met a lot of people that have

731
00:32:32,901 --> 00:32:35,690
a lot of drive but he has a very unusual
drive.

732
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:36,890
It's very,
it's real weird.

733
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:40,310
Have you ever done the math on I'm,
sometimes

734
00:32:40,310 --> 00:32:44,270
you shoot most of the time you shoot a
hundred arrows but I know there's been

735
00:32:44,271 --> 00:32:48,560
times where you and I have shot where
you've shot where I know I've shot over

736
00:32:48,561 --> 00:32:52,670
a hundred arrows and you've shot double
that because normally when I'm about

737
00:32:52,671 --> 00:32:55,190
saying I have feel like I had a good
practice.

738
00:32:55,191 --> 00:32:58,100
You're like yeah man,
I feel really warmed up right now.

739
00:32:58,650 --> 00:33:01,870
You know where that comes from.
It comes from playing pool when I and

740
00:33:02,020 --> 00:33:03,100
when you play pool,
this is,

741
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:07,900
this is real high level competitive pool
and I was never high level but um,

742
00:33:08,210 --> 00:33:12,410
when I got to be as good as I got,
I was always a what you would call a b

743
00:33:12,411 --> 00:33:15,350
player.
It takes a lot to become a b player.

744
00:33:15,470 --> 00:33:17,330
But I was always a b player and there's
a,

745
00:33:17,660 --> 00:33:21,080
is an a player,
an a player like borders pro and then

746
00:33:21,081 --> 00:33:22,800
there's pro,
which is like stratospheric,

747
00:33:22,810 --> 00:33:27,810
like you know Earl stricklin effort and
ray is best of the best top of the food

748
00:33:28,101 --> 00:33:28,400
chain.

749
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:32,810
This is different level,
but when you play pool,

750
00:33:33,020 --> 00:33:36,560
as you get better and better,
one of the things that,

751
00:33:36,580 --> 00:33:37,700
uh,
that you get,

752
00:33:37,701 --> 00:33:41,630
you develop like this feel and the feel
really kicks in with me about eight

753
00:33:41,631 --> 00:33:42,980
hours in.
So I would,

754
00:33:43,010 --> 00:33:45,140
I would be practicing,
I'm not joking,

755
00:33:45,320 --> 00:33:49,010
eight hours and I had a full on
sickness.

756
00:33:49,110 --> 00:33:51,320
Go ahead and pull that.
I know you're trying to do it off the

757
00:33:51,321 --> 00:33:54,150
mic.
How addictive of these goddamn on it.

758
00:33:54,151 --> 00:33:55,970
Protein bites.
Holy Shit.

759
00:33:56,690 --> 00:34:01,690
I want stock in these right there.
It's on these fricking to say good.

760
00:34:02,901 --> 00:34:05,570
I hate for those this morning.
And I told myself I was willing to eat

761
00:34:05,571 --> 00:34:07,340
one.
I was just doing some shit around the

762
00:34:07,341 --> 00:34:12,341
house before I made breakfast and my
fasted a window was up and so I was

763
00:34:12,441 --> 00:34:13,251
like,
I can eat now.

764
00:34:13,251 --> 00:34:14,330
It's like I just have one of these
things.

765
00:34:14,331 --> 00:34:15,830
I ate one.
I'm like I'm definitely having to,

766
00:34:16,040 --> 00:34:18,680
and then I ate too cause there's two in
a package and I said fuck that.

767
00:34:18,681 --> 00:34:20,900
I'm hoping in another package I ate four
of them.

768
00:34:21,050 --> 00:34:22,400
So I,
what is it,

769
00:34:22,401 --> 00:34:25,010
seven grams each.
So there's 28 grams of protein.

770
00:34:25,011 --> 00:34:28,880
I ate inside of five minutes.
These are so good.

771
00:34:29,120 --> 00:34:34,120
Prepare from I the other day I said for
anyone out there don't do it.

772
00:34:35,980 --> 00:34:37,910
Cause if you do it,
whatever these,

773
00:34:38,570 --> 00:34:41,690
whatever these are,
you're going to go from like this,

774
00:34:41,860 --> 00:34:44,680
the new on it.
These are the protein bites,

775
00:34:44,780 --> 00:34:47,860
coconut cashew and dark chocolate.
Actually the good fight you,

776
00:34:47,920 --> 00:34:52,920
I didn't have these,
Andy Stumpf had these first and he gave

777
00:34:54,551 --> 00:34:56,500
me these out of his backpack.
Where were we?

778
00:34:56,560 --> 00:35:01,560
Oh in Oklahoma we had done,
we had done quite a bit of a ride on the

779
00:35:01,931 --> 00:35:06,340
bikes for the day and I'm like I am
starving to death right now.

780
00:35:07,120 --> 00:35:10,960
And he pulled these out of his backpack
and I just said to tell how many of

781
00:35:10,961 --> 00:35:13,000
those did you bring?
And he's like,

782
00:35:13,001 --> 00:35:14,080
I don't know why.
And I'm like,

783
00:35:14,110 --> 00:35:17,350
those are going to be gone.
These are dynamite.

784
00:35:17,650 --> 00:35:20,470
My problem is in the morning,
I'm always,

785
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:24,160
I do like too fast in the morning before
my workouts.

786
00:35:24,790 --> 00:35:26,530
What?
What's the window you give yourself?

787
00:35:27,100 --> 00:35:30,130
I normally don't eat until about 10 30
or 11 in the morning.

788
00:35:30,150 --> 00:35:32,380
And what time do you eat at night before
you go to bed?

789
00:35:32,650 --> 00:35:33,640
Seven.
Oh,

790
00:35:33,641 --> 00:35:34,750
that's good.
That's a good window.

791
00:35:34,780 --> 00:35:36,640
Yeah.
And honestly,

792
00:35:36,670 --> 00:35:38,280
I,
I'm like

793
00:35:38,280 --> 00:35:40,320
starving,
but I'm not ready to cook yet.

794
00:35:40,530 --> 00:35:43,290
Or you know,
normally for my breakfast I'll normally

795
00:35:43,350 --> 00:35:47,700
half an avocado to a full avocado with
anywhere from like four to six eggs.

796
00:35:47,940 --> 00:35:50,700
And if I have any,
any meat leftover from the night before,

797
00:35:50,701 --> 00:35:55,140
I'll slice that and have it with,
but these things on the way to the gym,

798
00:35:55,141 --> 00:35:58,230
if I just feel like I don't have
anything in the tank,

799
00:35:58,590 --> 00:36:01,890
these had been awesome.
They're very low glycemic index,

800
00:36:01,891 --> 00:36:04,800
low sugar,
and even the protein's not ridiculous.

801
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:08,730
And when it's seven grams,
is that per byte or is that for the

802
00:36:08,731 --> 00:36:12,900
whole bar?
Read that shit according to most

803
00:36:13,290 --> 00:36:15,630
freaking serving samples.
Dude,

804
00:36:15,631 --> 00:36:16,980
I was reading something.
Oh my God.

805
00:36:16,981 --> 00:36:18,660
It says one bite.
Yeah,

806
00:36:18,690 --> 00:36:21,660
1.7 servings per container too.
Yeah.

807
00:36:21,720 --> 00:36:25,920
This is supposed to be one bite.
Well it's the bite is like the name for

808
00:36:25,921 --> 00:36:26,940
it.
It's not supposed to be like,

809
00:36:26,970 --> 00:36:28,470
how are you going to fit that whole
thing in your mouth?

810
00:36:29,790 --> 00:36:32,490
To me that's a bite.
Well it's they're called protein bites.

811
00:36:32,550 --> 00:36:35,370
Why wouldn't it be one square?
Cause you already bid out of it like

812
00:36:35,371 --> 00:36:36,210
you've been out of.
Again,

813
00:36:36,211 --> 00:36:37,770
that's two bites.
That's ridiculous.

814
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:40,980
It can't be one bite.
I mean you could do it if you had to.

815
00:36:41,160 --> 00:36:43,230
If I wasn't on a podcast,
I would have done that.

816
00:36:43,231 --> 00:36:45,780
Like nothing.
People get real mad by the way.

817
00:36:45,781 --> 00:36:47,550
They're gonna get mad at you for chewing
on the Mike.

818
00:36:47,640 --> 00:36:52,350
Can't be more annoying than Mel Gibson's
fricking pin almost shot myself in the

819
00:36:52,351 --> 00:36:56,490
face for that fricking thing.
I couldn't say anything to him.

820
00:36:56,700 --> 00:37:00,060
He's sitting over here,
dude,

821
00:37:00,140 --> 00:37:01,710
I,
if I want a nice guy,

822
00:37:01,711 --> 00:37:02,970
he's a nice guy.
He was,

823
00:37:02,971 --> 00:37:06,750
but he's fried.
There's a circuit that that just hit an

824
00:37:06,751 --> 00:37:10,440
overload and there's a black area where
it used to be connected to the

825
00:37:10,441 --> 00:37:12,360
motherboard.
I don't know.

826
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:14,640
Well you know more than me.
Nice guy.

827
00:37:14,670 --> 00:37:15,690
What's funny is,
um,

828
00:37:15,720 --> 00:37:16,553
you know,
my,

829
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:19,350
one of my followers is the brand of all
Brad's.

830
00:37:19,351 --> 00:37:23,010
He does all this on your podcast.
That was great podcast by the way.

831
00:37:23,460 --> 00:37:26,430
He made that yesterday,
which is kind of hilarious.

832
00:37:26,790 --> 00:37:30,690
John Dudley death dark your face over
Mel Gibson.

833
00:37:31,320 --> 00:37:32,310
Oh,
that's hilarious.

834
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:33,330
It,
yeah,

835
00:37:33,331 --> 00:37:36,330
it was funny.
But you have whatever that Penn was my

836
00:37:36,331 --> 00:37:38,010
God,
that was terrible.

837
00:37:38,490 --> 00:37:39,960
Yeah.
Well you know what it was,

838
00:37:39,990 --> 00:37:42,030
I just don't think he could just sit and
chill.

839
00:37:42,180 --> 00:37:45,330
And when Dr Neil Riordan was discussing
all this real hard,

840
00:37:45,570 --> 00:37:49,920
heavy duty scientific stuff when in
regards to stem cell research and all

841
00:37:49,921 --> 00:37:51,420
the different,
I mean he's had,

842
00:37:51,510 --> 00:37:53,070
I mean one of the reasons why he came
on,

843
00:37:53,071 --> 00:37:55,590
he wanted to come on the podcast and
people were like,

844
00:37:55,591 --> 00:37:57,270
why didn't you ask him about his wife?

845
00:37:57,630 --> 00:38:00,090
Why did you ask him about the,
that's not what he's here for.

846
00:38:00,610 --> 00:38:03,780
I want to be respectful to the guy.
I'm a fan of Mel Gibson and he's a nice

847
00:38:03,781 --> 00:38:05,730
guy.
What he asked is he said,

848
00:38:05,731 --> 00:38:10,020
can I come on the podcast and talk about
the stem cell research they're doing in

849
00:38:10,021 --> 00:38:14,580
Panama and the treatments that they gave
to my dad at 92 years of age.

850
00:38:14,581 --> 00:38:15,990
Now he's thriving.
It almost,

851
00:38:16,040 --> 00:38:18,480
it was a great podcast.
And you know,

852
00:38:18,481 --> 00:38:19,314
I'm,
I'm,

853
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:24,800
I'm a believer in stem cell because you
actually introduced me to doctor Rati

854
00:38:25,080 --> 00:38:27,130
Mcgee in Las Vegas.
Saved,

855
00:38:27,600 --> 00:38:29,970
I mean potentially you saved my archery
career.

856
00:38:30,420 --> 00:38:34,000
Well,
cause we get from surgery if I will.

857
00:38:34,180 --> 00:38:36,100
Yeah.
And surgeries

858
00:38:36,100 --> 00:38:37,400
are fricking hit or miss.
Right,

859
00:38:37,401 --> 00:38:39,190
right.
So that's what I'm saying.

860
00:38:39,790 --> 00:38:43,180
I was lucky with my shoulder surgery
that I got out of there.

861
00:38:43,181 --> 00:38:45,010
Good.
I know a lot of guys that are into their

862
00:38:45,011 --> 00:38:49,600
third one for the same type of thing,
but literally I got

863
00:38:50,530 --> 00:38:51,020
okay,

864
00:38:51,020 --> 00:38:56,020
three injections the first time and went
back for a second round because I think

865
00:38:56,151 --> 00:39:01,151
one of my tears didn't take.
And literally I took completely avoided

866
00:39:02,121 --> 00:39:03,910
surgery because of doctrine mcgee.

867
00:39:03,980 --> 00:39:07,640
And we should talk about this because I
don't know the exact specifics of what

868
00:39:07,641 --> 00:39:09,950
it was called,
what the original treatment was called,

869
00:39:09,951 --> 00:39:11,810
but the original treatment that you and
I both got,

870
00:39:11,811 --> 00:39:13,470
he no longer baby.
Definitely quick,

871
00:39:13,720 --> 00:39:17,600
quick got a baby does this past weekend,
but it's not available anymore.

872
00:39:17,780 --> 00:39:21,470
It's a,
it's because they believe this is what

873
00:39:21,530 --> 00:39:25,310
they're trying to make it legal.
But it has to go through a series of,

874
00:39:25,390 --> 00:39:28,510
uh,
there's a whole process that it has to

875
00:39:28,590 --> 00:39:31,730
get it passed because they've declared
it a drug.

876
00:39:32,120 --> 00:39:35,600
Because you take the,
is something about umbilical cord stem

877
00:39:35,601 --> 00:39:38,510
cells.
You take them and convert them and then

878
00:39:38,511 --> 00:39:41,810
that somehow or another,
the in during the process they believe

879
00:39:41,840 --> 00:39:43,970
it's become a drug.
Whatever that drug is.

880
00:39:44,150 --> 00:39:47,060
I had a full length tear of my rotator
cuff.

881
00:39:47,061 --> 00:39:50,930
Now this is from an MRI,
full length tear of my rotator cuff.

882
00:39:50,931 --> 00:39:53,090
It was painful.
It was a real problem.

883
00:39:53,660 --> 00:39:56,150
Doctor Rati Mcgee in Las Vegas,
Nevada,

884
00:39:56,180 --> 00:39:58,250
shot,
whatever that baby dust is in there.

885
00:39:58,470 --> 00:40:00,110
Gave you some end,
uh,

886
00:40:00,140 --> 00:40:05,060
the most recent MRI that I got,
which is over a year from his original

887
00:40:05,061 --> 00:40:07,040
treme.
But I knew that it felt a lot better,

888
00:40:07,070 --> 00:40:08,690
but I have,
I just haven't got it checked.

889
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:09,670
It's gone.

890
00:40:09,670 --> 00:40:13,030
Funny enough,
I was with you both times right the

891
00:40:13,031 --> 00:40:14,350
first time,
which,

892
00:40:14,620 --> 00:40:16,150
I mean,
I didn't say anything about,

893
00:40:16,151 --> 00:40:19,720
but you had,
you had been struggling to shoot a lot

894
00:40:19,870 --> 00:40:22,060
because you know,
you had just,

895
00:40:22,300 --> 00:40:23,680
it's wearing tear.
I mean,

896
00:40:23,681 --> 00:40:26,050
the bottom line is it's wear and tear
over life,

897
00:40:26,080 --> 00:40:29,050
especially with you and I,
we do a lot of active stuff.

898
00:40:29,560 --> 00:40:34,020
But for you to go back and you and I
went in together,

899
00:40:34,390 --> 00:40:38,760
uh,
last week and when he said he looked at

900
00:40:38,761 --> 00:40:40,470
you with this confused face and said,
yeah,

901
00:40:40,471 --> 00:40:44,040
hey,
a new MRI that is healed,

902
00:40:44,490 --> 00:40:45,710
that's fricking massive.

903
00:40:45,730 --> 00:40:48,250
It's massive.
That's a tear that would have normally

904
00:40:48,251 --> 00:40:52,720
absolutely required surgery or I could
have just been in pain with an unstable

905
00:40:52,721 --> 00:40:54,100
shoulder.
You know,

906
00:40:54,270 --> 00:40:58,420
one of the things that I'm realizing is
that over the years of uh,

907
00:40:58,660 --> 00:41:01,150
essentially being engulfed in martial
arts,

908
00:41:01,151 --> 00:41:04,570
most of my adult life and even into my
teenage years,

909
00:41:04,571 --> 00:41:07,090
like at 15,
I became a fanatic.

910
00:41:07,150 --> 00:41:09,250
Like from then on,
martial arts has always been a part of

911
00:41:09,251 --> 00:41:12,670
my life.
I've done some ruthless shit with my

912
00:41:12,671 --> 00:41:15,040
joints.
Both of my knees had been reconstructed.

913
00:41:15,250 --> 00:41:17,440
I've had some real problems with my neck
in the past,

914
00:41:17,441 --> 00:41:19,750
both of my shoulders,
f of cause of problems.

915
00:41:19,751 --> 00:41:23,530
It's just explosive,
crazy shit.

916
00:41:23,531 --> 00:41:25,910
Your arms are getting yanked in weird
directions,

917
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:28,120
your foot windmill,
that stuff.

918
00:41:28,121 --> 00:41:32,830
That's the easiest stuff that's probably
saved me all that big foot I really

919
00:41:32,831 --> 00:41:36,350
think saved me because that's shoulders
to ability because that's controlled,

920
00:41:36,590 --> 00:41:38,420
you know,
all that stuff that I'm doing that's all

921
00:41:38,421 --> 00:41:42,050
strengthening all these muscles around
it and that doesn't bother me.

922
00:41:42,070 --> 00:41:45,650
That doesn't give me any pain.
What would give me pain is like off

923
00:41:45,651 --> 00:41:48,530
angle punches.
Like you land on someone's elbow in a

924
00:41:48,531 --> 00:41:50,770
weird way and you feel something

925
00:41:50,900 --> 00:41:52,830
go for it right now.
Even thinking about it.

926
00:41:52,831 --> 00:41:53,560
Yeah.

927
00:41:53,560 --> 00:41:56,380
Getting caught in something like Kamora
and not tapping.

928
00:41:56,590 --> 00:41:59,230
I've done that a bunch of times.
Like a shithead.

929
00:42:00,130 --> 00:42:01,770
You're a meathead,
you know you,

930
00:42:01,820 --> 00:42:04,570
you don't want to tap but you gotta tap
but you don't want you to like,

931
00:42:04,571 --> 00:42:07,150
there's gotta be a way to get out of
this without tapping and then you get

932
00:42:07,151 --> 00:42:08,950
out.
But then you can't do chin ups for like

933
00:42:08,951 --> 00:42:13,390
three months.
That's happened 30 times in my life.

934
00:42:13,420 --> 00:42:15,940
Like no joke.
Like where I didn't tap and then I was

935
00:42:15,941 --> 00:42:19,060
fucked up for a few months and then I
would tape everything up and keep

936
00:42:19,061 --> 00:42:19,870
rolling.

937
00:42:19,870 --> 00:42:21,400
Well you,
you hooked me up with,

938
00:42:21,670 --> 00:42:26,670
with Damien in Demoine for 10 planet and
I really wanted to do,

939
00:42:27,460 --> 00:42:32,460
she just did classes with them,
but I'm so afraid to do it in a class

940
00:42:33,371 --> 00:42:36,310
because for me it's my arms or my
career.

941
00:42:36,340 --> 00:42:37,001
Right,
right.

942
00:42:37,001 --> 00:42:41,800
And I mean it would literally be like
turning a light switch off in your room.

943
00:42:41,990 --> 00:42:44,420
My friend Max [inaudible],
he's a professional pool player and he

944
00:42:44,421 --> 00:42:47,540
said the same thing.
He was really interested in trying

945
00:42:47,570 --> 00:42:50,330
Jujitsu.
So scared of getting his arm bar,

946
00:42:50,750 --> 00:42:54,560
getting locked in an arm bar and fucking
his elbow or shoulder up and then he

947
00:42:54,561 --> 00:42:57,500
wouldn't be able to play.
Well it's a real legitimate concern.

948
00:42:58,120 --> 00:43:00,220
Two days ago,
I don't even know if I told you this,

949
00:43:00,250 --> 00:43:04,660
but I'm andy texts me and she stumped.
Yeah.

950
00:43:04,661 --> 00:43:09,661
He put me in a group text and needed a
closer and Jocko reached out.

951
00:43:11,681 --> 00:43:15,700
We were in a group text and Jocko wants
a boat and wants lessons he wants.

952
00:43:15,701 --> 00:43:19,990
So does of course he does.
So it's kind of a fucking knife in his

953
00:43:19,991 --> 00:43:20,561
teeth.
What?

954
00:43:20,561 --> 00:43:21,850
Full draw.
Yeah.

955
00:43:21,851 --> 00:43:25,720
And he's like just make something,
he won't break in half cause he's like

956
00:43:25,721 --> 00:43:27,300
he will break it.
Yeah.

957
00:43:27,640 --> 00:43:30,230
And uh,
I thought Ah Shit,

958
00:43:30,250 --> 00:43:34,180
if I've got to have jack over,
I know we're going to end up working out

959
00:43:34,181 --> 00:43:35,920
cause if he's at my house more than two
days,

960
00:43:35,921 --> 00:43:37,900
I'm not going to skip two days of
working out.

961
00:43:38,200 --> 00:43:41,710
So I thought I better hit the fricking
squat rack cause I'm more of a bike guy.

962
00:43:41,711 --> 00:43:44,650
Like all,
most of my leg workouts come from,

963
00:43:45,430 --> 00:43:47,890
well they come from kettle bells or they
come from,

964
00:43:47,950 --> 00:43:52,950
from biking because I liked the bat bike
or ruck when I thought we'll explain

965
00:43:53,111 --> 00:43:56,260
ruck to people rocking is where you just
have a,

966
00:43:56,620 --> 00:44:01,600
a full weighted backpack on essentially
in your just power walking.

967
00:44:01,630 --> 00:44:06,370
You're almost going for an outdoor walk.
And um,

968
00:44:06,400 --> 00:44:09,460
the outdoorsman,
which you actually sent to me.

969
00:44:09,490 --> 00:44:11,200
Thank you.
Um,

970
00:44:11,290 --> 00:44:14,160
cause I kept telling you I want to do,
you know,

971
00:44:14,170 --> 00:44:17,020
some power I want to do,
like pretty much,

972
00:44:17,560 --> 00:44:21,640
I want to pretend like I'm packing out
elk quarters to prepare for it.

973
00:44:21,641 --> 00:44:22,301
And you said,
dude,

974
00:44:22,301 --> 00:44:24,330
you gotta check out this pack.
It's called that

975
00:44:24,520 --> 00:44:27,790
atlas trainer and it's available at
outdoorsman [inaudible] dot com not a

976
00:44:27,791 --> 00:44:30,670
sponsor.
Just nice people that make good stuff.

977
00:44:30,671 --> 00:44:32,790
They're there.
They specialize in optics,

978
00:44:32,791 --> 00:44:35,310
really.
Most of their businesses and selling

979
00:44:35,311 --> 00:44:38,940
high end binoculars to a hunters.
Yeah,

980
00:44:38,970 --> 00:44:39,520
they're,
they're,

981
00:44:39,520 --> 00:44:42,330
they're the optics authority.
They're amazing with optics.

982
00:44:42,331 --> 00:44:45,090
Like they do a lot.
Have you ever listened to the Jay Scott

983
00:44:45,091 --> 00:44:48,600
outdoors podcast now?
God's got a really good podcast,

984
00:44:48,720 --> 00:44:51,090
super specific to hunting.
Anybody.

985
00:44:51,120 --> 00:44:53,700
I mean,
it's not like this podcast where it's

986
00:44:53,701 --> 00:44:55,250
like,
we'll talk about all kinds of shit and

987
00:44:55,650 --> 00:45:00,120
how many dudes have little rubber muscle
men up there ass she's got,

988
00:45:00,300 --> 00:45:02,470
it's not talking about any of that,
but what he's had,

989
00:45:02,670 --> 00:45:07,670
cody Nelson who's one of the owners of a
outdoorsman and they go into like edge

990
00:45:08,030 --> 00:45:12,690
to edge clarity,
high end details of Swarovski's Zeiss,

991
00:45:13,040 --> 00:45:16,650
a vortex,
like all these different by nose and

992
00:45:16,651 --> 00:45:18,170
they talk about,
you know,

993
00:45:18,510 --> 00:45:20,850
all the different aspects of like
what's,

994
00:45:21,030 --> 00:45:23,640
what's the best shit to buy,
what's the best shit for this price

995
00:45:23,641 --> 00:45:24,870
point for that price point.

996
00:45:24,870 --> 00:45:27,450
And they get like super geeky and in
depth with it,

997
00:45:27,451 --> 00:45:30,390
but there's no better resource than
outdoors.

998
00:45:30,391 --> 00:45:33,450
ms.com like they have everything.
They have all the high end stuff,

999
00:45:33,451 --> 00:45:35,610
they're really good deals.
But they also have this,

1000
00:45:35,611 --> 00:45:36,750
uh,
atlas trainer,

1001
00:45:37,020 --> 00:45:39,510
which is because their whole thing is
western hunting.

1002
00:45:39,930 --> 00:45:44,760
And see when I think most people that
don't know what hunting is or did it not

1003
00:45:44,761 --> 00:45:47,550
in the world,
which to me prior to 2012 they think of

1004
00:45:47,551 --> 00:45:52,200
hunting is fucking elmer fudd some dude
with a orange vest on shooting some

1005
00:45:52,201 --> 00:45:53,400
poor,
innocent animal.

1006
00:45:54,120 --> 00:45:57,210
What western hunting is,
and this is where it gets really weird.

1007
00:45:58,110 --> 00:46:03,110
It's fitness with mental strength,
discipline and then hunting.

1008
00:46:04,350 --> 00:46:07,560
There's so much involved in it.
You're dealing with mountains,

1009
00:46:07,561 --> 00:46:09,750
so you have mountaineering,
hiking.

1010
00:46:10,080 --> 00:46:14,270
It's a tough mudder with a weapon.
It is and that's what it is.

1011
00:46:14,710 --> 00:46:16,320
You can only appreciate that.

1012
00:46:16,470 --> 00:46:18,860
I'm trying to get them to trying to get
them to,

1013
00:46:18,880 --> 00:46:23,070
because I become a new are absorbed like
this backpack shit that we were talking

1014
00:46:23,071 --> 00:46:25,110
about like what remi does on a regular
basis.

1015
00:46:25,410 --> 00:46:29,700
Aaron Snyder and Snyder who does a,
an amazing podcast called Kfar who cast,

1016
00:46:29,701 --> 00:46:33,420
it's a,
it's a Cafaro was a real high end,

1017
00:46:33,730 --> 00:46:37,360
a backpack company.
They make like real rugged backpack

1018
00:46:37,361 --> 00:46:41,550
specifically designed for hunting and
for military tactical and stuff like

1019
00:46:41,551 --> 00:46:42,540
that.
But Aaron Snyder,

1020
00:46:42,541 --> 00:46:47,520
one of the guy who runs it is a serious
hunter and he does those crazy 30 day

1021
00:46:47,521 --> 00:46:50,280
trips like out in the bullets,
out in the woods,

1022
00:46:50,281 --> 00:46:53,820
just living off your back book.
That's what Bush,

1023
00:46:54,330 --> 00:46:56,850
Bush and woods hanging around with.
Adam Green tree too much.

1024
00:46:56,910 --> 00:46:59,160
I call it the bush.
I think we're,

1025
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:02,200
we've officially killed this angel's
wings.

1026
00:47:02,370 --> 00:47:04,170
Too much body.
What?

1027
00:47:04,200 --> 00:47:06,930
There's too much mass in you.
You can go through too much alcohol.

1028
00:47:07,230 --> 00:47:10,470
Like I have to think about you probably
wait like 40 pounds heavier than me,

1029
00:47:10,471 --> 00:47:12,990
so I have to have to put it in
consideration.

1030
00:47:13,320 --> 00:47:14,610
How much to take in.
No,

1031
00:47:14,611 --> 00:47:17,640
you don't.
This is great.

1032
00:47:17,641 --> 00:47:21,750
Podcasts are made by friends and
alcohol.

1033
00:47:21,840 --> 00:47:24,450
Yup.
Well that one that we did in Lanai when

1034
00:47:24,451 --> 00:47:27,290
it was all of us,
you and me and Ben O'brian and Sam.

1035
00:47:27,291 --> 00:47:29,990
So halt and have to get Shane Dorian,
Jack.

1036
00:47:30,240 --> 00:47:32,320
I'll go grab it.
You just keep us occupied.

1037
00:47:32,350 --> 00:47:34,570
Yup.
Remi uh,

1038
00:47:34,660 --> 00:47:38,350
Shane Dorian.
Ben O'brien,

1039
00:47:38,590 --> 00:47:43,590
my wife Shazzie fresh and my boy was
there.

1040
00:47:44,230 --> 00:47:46,390
I think I got everybody.
I think you got everybody.

1041
00:47:46,670 --> 00:47:48,160
Um,
we said Remi,

1042
00:47:48,190 --> 00:47:48,850
right?
Yeah.

1043
00:47:48,850 --> 00:47:50,040
Yes,
Shane,

1044
00:47:50,740 --> 00:47:54,420
Jack or you want to try this?
Mccowen counting Brian.

1045
00:47:54,430 --> 00:47:56,950
Good Little Brian.
What you want to try some local stuff?

1046
00:47:56,951 --> 00:47:59,270
We've got some stuff that I just got
from bigger stuff over here.

1047
00:47:59,271 --> 00:48:01,210
I'll,
I'll take this sucker over.

1048
00:48:01,840 --> 00:48:02,680
Um,
yeah,

1049
00:48:02,681 --> 00:48:07,030
I made a note here that was b and I have
no idea what that topic was.

1050
00:48:07,031 --> 00:48:10,480
We've shifted gears so many times.
This is a bauers

1051
00:48:12,220 --> 00:48:16,460
bauers whiskey in this from Bakersfield.
And I was just in Bakersfield.

1052
00:48:16,690 --> 00:48:18,730
Not a sponsor,
but not a sponsor,

1053
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:22,750
but nice folks that left me in a nice
glass of a nice bottle,

1054
00:48:22,751 --> 00:48:24,730
rather a whiskey.
So beautiful bottle.

1055
00:48:25,060 --> 00:48:26,320
You know,
I didn't know this,

1056
00:48:26,321 --> 00:48:28,480
but that area,
Bakersfield,

1057
00:48:28,481 --> 00:48:30,190
like that whole area,
that's where,

1058
00:48:30,250 --> 00:48:33,580
um,
that's where there will be blood was all

1059
00:48:33,581 --> 00:48:34,414
about.

1060
00:48:34,630 --> 00:48:36,310
You ever see that movie?
Daniel Day Lewis?

1061
00:48:36,430 --> 00:48:38,320
I love that movie.
I didn't know that,

1062
00:48:38,350 --> 00:48:41,440
but he was amazing in that movie.
Right?

1063
00:48:41,890 --> 00:48:45,310
I actually really legitimately like that
movie.

1064
00:48:45,400 --> 00:48:46,600
Oh,
I love that to ice.

1065
00:48:46,601 --> 00:48:49,570
But that's all right.
We get some more ice cream.

1066
00:48:49,620 --> 00:48:52,750
We've got a to hook us up.
The spice that was,

1067
00:48:53,260 --> 00:48:55,810
that was at least 20 ounces.
Like you could die.

1068
00:48:56,740 --> 00:48:59,440
We're not driving.
We're going to be shooting arrows.

1069
00:49:00,310 --> 00:49:02,170
Luckily face no one here.
I know.

1070
00:49:02,770 --> 00:49:05,560
And we're surrounded by concrete
concrete.

1071
00:49:05,561 --> 00:49:08,200
By the way,
Dow grade is that set up by the way.

1072
00:49:08,201 --> 00:49:10,110
I got to thank you for hooking me up
with those uh,

1073
00:49:10,150 --> 00:49:12,070
block targets.
Awesome.

1074
00:49:12,250 --> 00:49:14,830
Only my arms are long enough to reach
across this table.

1075
00:49:16,300 --> 00:49:18,520
Anyone else you would have came up way
short,

1076
00:49:19,930 --> 00:49:22,180
Dick against the wall.
Um,

1077
00:49:22,210 --> 00:49:24,190
but these guys that do this,
this,

1078
00:49:24,191 --> 00:49:27,070
uh,
there's this hardcore back country

1079
00:49:27,071 --> 00:49:27,400
hunting.

1080
00:49:27,400 --> 00:49:30,010
It's sort of what we like what we were
talking about before it was worth,

1081
00:49:30,310 --> 00:49:35,310
there's levels to this and the way you
work out is to stay healthy and to be

1082
00:49:35,381 --> 00:49:38,320
fit in comparison to some guy like David
Goggins,

1083
00:49:38,470 --> 00:49:40,780
some maniac,
some campaigns type maniac,

1084
00:49:40,781 --> 00:49:42,820
right?
But there's,

1085
00:49:43,210 --> 00:49:47,860
there's levels to like everything.
Like some guys just want to go out and

1086
00:49:47,861 --> 00:49:52,420
try to hunt for their meat and you know,
go out and have a weekend hunt and

1087
00:49:52,421 --> 00:49:56,950
Wisconsin or Colorado or wherever you
guys want to put orange on for seven

1088
00:49:56,951 --> 00:49:59,230
days.
The other totally content with that.

1089
00:49:59,290 --> 00:50:03,760
And then there's guys who take it as far
as you can go.

1090
00:50:04,750 --> 00:50:08,440
Weirdos.
And then the Weirdos amongst the

1091
00:50:08,441 --> 00:50:09,580
Weirdos,
right?

1092
00:50:09,860 --> 00:50:11,320
Guys like Adam,
Adam Green,

1093
00:50:11,321 --> 00:50:14,740
true goes lives in the mountain and
facebook's the whole thing.

1094
00:50:14,741 --> 00:50:16,810
And instagram lives the whole thing.
Yup.

1095
00:50:17,680 --> 00:50:18,301
Yeah.
It's a,

1096
00:50:18,301 --> 00:50:20,890
it's a thing.
It's not what everybody thinks it is.

1097
00:50:20,891 --> 00:50:23,860
It's a thing.
And I think that thing gets clouded up

1098
00:50:23,861 --> 00:50:25,900
by so,
so much distraction.

1099
00:50:26,350 --> 00:50:28,220
I think a lot of don't know what the
thing

1100
00:50:28,220 --> 00:50:29,080
is,
you know,

1101
00:50:29,081 --> 00:50:31,430
so they think of it as being some,
oh,

1102
00:50:31,431 --> 00:50:32,540
look at that.
A little nice.

1103
00:50:32,990 --> 00:50:34,010
Ooh.
Ooh.

1104
00:50:34,011 --> 00:50:37,550
Breaking ice in jre.
Is that a Yeti ice bucket?

1105
00:50:37,580 --> 00:50:38,540
I'll be darned.
Does it?

1106
00:50:39,430 --> 00:50:40,640
No,
it's a regular ice bucket.

1107
00:50:40,820 --> 00:50:44,000
Does you have an ice bucket and we need
an ice bucket.

1108
00:50:44,030 --> 00:50:45,650
Oh,
for everybody who wanted one of these,

1109
00:50:45,740 --> 00:50:47,960
uh,
jre tumblers,

1110
00:50:47,961 --> 00:50:49,910
they're gone.
Gone to 20 minutes.

1111
00:50:50,510 --> 00:50:52,940
I underestimated it.
Sounds like my releases.

1112
00:50:53,180 --> 00:50:55,010
Yeah.
I only ordered 300 of them,

1113
00:50:55,760 --> 00:50:59,660
but we're ordering water in 2000 now,
so I fucked up.

1114
00:50:59,750 --> 00:51:01,100
Sorry.
Sorry.

1115
00:51:01,220 --> 00:51:03,470
We'll get them as quick as we can.
Hopefully Yeti.

1116
00:51:03,980 --> 00:51:05,150
If you,
uh,

1117
00:51:05,810 --> 00:51:09,070
just find Ben O'bryan on instagram and
yell at them

1118
00:51:10,590 --> 00:51:11,840
or guy.
Cheers.

1119
00:51:13,760 --> 00:51:15,020
Thanks for having me out.
My pleasure,

1120
00:51:15,021 --> 00:51:16,750
brother.
We're,

1121
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:19,100
we're prepping.
People hate that sound.

1122
00:51:19,940 --> 00:51:22,370
They hate to sound slurping.
They hate the sound of chewing.

1123
00:51:22,460 --> 00:51:23,293
I get it.

1124
00:51:23,360 --> 00:51:25,610
You're on the treadmill right now.
You're on the treadmill right now.

1125
00:51:25,940 --> 00:51:28,820
You're thinking about quitting and you
hear someone chewing,

1126
00:51:28,821 --> 00:51:31,400
slurp and you're like,
fuck this podcast man.

1127
00:51:31,730 --> 00:51:33,110
Fuck this.
Well,

1128
00:51:33,111 --> 00:51:35,120
I got off subject,
but what I was talking about,

1129
00:51:35,180 --> 00:51:39,260
I was going to do some squats just
because I felt like ready for Jocko.

1130
00:51:39,700 --> 00:51:40,340
Yeah,
yeah.

1131
00:51:40,340 --> 00:51:43,040
At least need to do one 35 ones.
Uh,

1132
00:51:45,710 --> 00:51:50,710
but a member the other day when I was in
Rodney's and he was ben to me all around

1133
00:51:50,871 --> 00:51:55,871
checking my arm when I hold a squat bar,
that is what gives me my pain right now.

1134
00:51:58,550 --> 00:52:00,620
Do you get massaged often?
Um,

1135
00:52:00,650 --> 00:52:03,470
I get,
I normally get it about four times a

1136
00:52:03,471 --> 00:52:06,740
year.
I have a guy that I go all the way to

1137
00:52:06,741 --> 00:52:09,020
Oklahoma for,
it's about 600 miles,

1138
00:52:09,050 --> 00:52:12,170
but his name is Lester Phillips.
Did you fly or do you drive?

1139
00:52:13,310 --> 00:52:14,620
I drive down there,
Geez,

1140
00:52:14,640 --> 00:52:16,580
yes,
name is Lester Phillips.

1141
00:52:16,710 --> 00:52:19,880
Ain't trying to get a massage and he's
at a,

1142
00:52:19,940 --> 00:52:21,650
he's actually at a,
um,

1143
00:52:21,710 --> 00:52:24,050
uh,
fitness building called body masters,

1144
00:52:24,051 --> 00:52:29,051
but he is amazing at breaking apart scar
tissue and literally getting into areas

1145
00:52:31,491 --> 00:52:34,100
that most people don't take the time
for.

1146
00:52:34,670 --> 00:52:37,310
Um,
and I normally go for two hours just for

1147
00:52:37,311 --> 00:52:40,880
one joint.
Jeez Christ.

1148
00:52:41,480 --> 00:52:44,120
But if you're sober this whole time,
yeah,

1149
00:52:44,450 --> 00:52:46,460
but if you're doing something well it's
arguable,

1150
00:52:46,820 --> 00:52:48,670
but it depends.
Um,

1151
00:52:48,770 --> 00:52:52,100
if you're doing something that's very
repetitive in your sport,

1152
00:52:52,430 --> 00:52:55,220
then those particular areas build,
you know,

1153
00:52:55,221 --> 00:52:59,210
it's just like I would,
a lot of times he tells me that my,

1154
00:52:59,660 --> 00:53:04,250
my bicep and my forearm connector on my
right side are a lot like what a

1155
00:53:04,251 --> 00:53:06,890
fighters are.
That's a right hand prominent where

1156
00:53:06,891 --> 00:53:11,891
they're having impact in the same with
my left because as you're shooting,

1157
00:53:12,141 --> 00:53:17,141
it's just constant hyperextension so you
build that scarring in there and when

1158
00:53:17,571 --> 00:53:19,400
the scarring isn't,
you know,

1159
00:53:19,430 --> 00:53:22,310
it's restricting the muscle from moving
properly.

1160
00:53:22,460 --> 00:53:24,770
You know,
he talks to me like he said,

1161
00:53:24,771 --> 00:53:25,441
if,
you know,

1162
00:53:25,441 --> 00:53:26,220
if you have long

1163
00:53:26,220 --> 00:53:28,560
hair and you,
and you get out of the shower,

1164
00:53:28,561 --> 00:53:31,410
it's not all the fibers aren't going the
same direction.

1165
00:53:31,710 --> 00:53:35,010
You have to like get all the knots and
stuff out of there.

1166
00:53:35,370 --> 00:53:39,480
So essentially he's trying to break up
those areas where the muscles aren't

1167
00:53:39,600 --> 00:53:42,180
flowing back and forth,
um,

1168
00:53:42,210 --> 00:53:45,450
smoothly.
So even though I don't have necessarily

1169
00:53:45,451 --> 00:53:47,430
a tear,
I feel soreness at times.

1170
00:53:47,850 --> 00:53:51,030
Um,
I would say maybe even a chronic

1171
00:53:51,031 --> 00:53:53,040
soreness,
but if I go and actually have that

1172
00:53:53,041 --> 00:53:54,930
broken apart,
uh,

1173
00:53:54,931 --> 00:53:59,931
it's extremely painful to do.
But my performance afterwards is just

1174
00:54:00,690 --> 00:54:03,420
night and day different.
I think you should do it a lot.

1175
00:54:03,630 --> 00:54:04,650
I really do.
And I,

1176
00:54:04,770 --> 00:54:05,610
and I,
I'm,

1177
00:54:05,670 --> 00:54:07,650
it's hard to find that good person
though.

1178
00:54:07,660 --> 00:54:10,200
That's the problem.
That's why it goes so far,

1179
00:54:10,230 --> 00:54:12,060
you know,
is to find someone that really,

1180
00:54:12,061 --> 00:54:15,060
really knows what they're doing.
Do you have a time massage place in your

1181
00:54:15,061 --> 00:54:16,950
town?
No.

1182
00:54:16,980 --> 00:54:18,810
I don't know.
I mean,

1183
00:54:19,410 --> 00:54:20,490
yeah,
no ties.

1184
00:54:20,491 --> 00:54:22,170
Make it up to Iowa.
Yeah.

1185
00:54:22,380 --> 00:54:24,060
This is some kind of,
I'm around here man.

1186
00:54:24,061 --> 00:54:25,500
And you know,
not,

1187
00:54:25,530 --> 00:54:27,240
not very expensive,
but amazing.

1188
00:54:27,241 --> 00:54:29,160
Like I had this lady that walks on my
back,

1189
00:54:29,500 --> 00:54:32,510
she's probably about 60 years old.
She walks about on my back,

1190
00:54:32,540 --> 00:54:35,850
grabs my wrists and pulls them up,
pop that back.

1191
00:54:38,720 --> 00:54:40,950
But she's,
she's stretches you out,

1192
00:54:40,951 --> 00:54:42,900
man.
It's like part of the thing,

1193
00:54:43,180 --> 00:54:44,910
um,
is a massage.

1194
00:54:44,911 --> 00:54:47,550
And then once she gets in that tissue
and loosens it up,

1195
00:54:47,551 --> 00:54:49,980
then she starts pulling on your arms and
stretching you out.

1196
00:54:50,490 --> 00:54:53,100
Time massage is legit.
It's really good holders.

1197
00:54:53,101 --> 00:54:54,950
Jack.
Now my best helps it.

1198
00:54:55,110 --> 00:54:57,350
I'm lady trying to rip your arms out of
the socket.

1199
00:54:57,360 --> 00:55:01,470
I'd be fucked without her.
It'd be fucked with a lot of different

1200
00:55:01,471 --> 00:55:02,700
things.
But that's one of them.

1201
00:55:02,830 --> 00:55:03,660
Yeah.
Um,

1202
00:55:03,660 --> 00:55:04,800
but this,
uh,

1203
00:55:05,040 --> 00:55:07,710
stem cell research that they're involved
in right now,

1204
00:55:07,800 --> 00:55:11,190
they're what they're doing right now in
Panama because it's not legal in the

1205
00:55:11,191 --> 00:55:13,410
United States.
That was a good podcast.

1206
00:55:13,620 --> 00:55:14,520
Yeah.
It was amazing.

1207
00:55:14,521 --> 00:55:15,210
Right.
The Guy,

1208
00:55:15,210 --> 00:55:17,010
Dr Neil reared,
he's very good.

1209
00:55:17,040 --> 00:55:20,070
He's amazing.
They just passed a significant hurdle in

1210
00:55:20,071 --> 00:55:21,210
Texas.
Yup.

1211
00:55:21,240 --> 00:55:23,760
So they're real close to being able to
do that in Texas.

1212
00:55:23,760 --> 00:55:28,760
And it might happen as soon as the fall.
So somewhere around,

1213
00:55:28,880 --> 00:55:30,180
uh,
archery season,

1214
00:55:30,750 --> 00:55:33,750
you might be able to go.
He's like to be able to go to Texas and

1215
00:55:33,751 --> 00:55:35,850
get all the same stuff that we're going
to get in Panama.

1216
00:55:35,851 --> 00:55:37,520
What you should do,
man,

1217
00:55:37,590 --> 00:55:40,640
if anybody listens to that podcast or
anybody's talking to talk,

1218
00:55:40,660 --> 00:55:45,120
talk to someone like me who has
benefited tremendously from it and I

1219
00:55:45,121 --> 00:55:47,340
haven't even gone and done what he's
doing,

1220
00:55:47,341 --> 00:55:51,510
which is complete next level in Panama,
but I know Tj dillashaw,

1221
00:55:51,511 --> 00:55:54,090
UFC bantamweight champion,
he's gone there twice now.

1222
00:55:54,600 --> 00:55:57,240
Fucking had massive,
massive recovery from it.

1223
00:55:57,270 --> 00:55:58,480
It's amazing.
We're,

1224
00:55:58,540 --> 00:56:03,540
we're in an incredible time when it
comes to medical science and technology

1225
00:56:05,311 --> 00:56:08,340
and innovation,
like what they're able to do and fix and

1226
00:56:08,341 --> 00:56:09,900
heal people,
you know,

1227
00:56:09,901 --> 00:56:13,050
that have had really significant
injuries.

1228
00:56:13,051 --> 00:56:15,000
That would have been a giant problem
before.

1229
00:56:15,170 --> 00:56:16,760
I have a friend of mine,
she works at the UFC.

1230
00:56:16,780 --> 00:56:20,670
My friend Heather,
she had a achilles tendon injury from

1231
00:56:20,671 --> 00:56:21,690
Rati.
Yes.

1232
00:56:21,720 --> 00:56:23,100
He did the surgery.
Yes,

1233
00:56:23,440 --> 00:56:24,190
and she's

1234
00:56:24,190 --> 00:56:27,340
six weeks later walking around without a
limp dude.

1235
00:56:27,490 --> 00:56:30,910
She told me that sick,
it would be six months where she would

1236
00:56:30,911 --> 00:56:35,500
be in a cast if it wasn't for a,
there's this new stuff that's crazy.

1237
00:56:35,560 --> 00:56:36,670
She's walking around without a limp.

1238
00:56:36,980 --> 00:56:39,770
I remember when you were in there and I
was uh,

1239
00:56:39,830 --> 00:56:43,370
Rodney came in and he,
he had told you about the MRI and said

1240
00:56:44,780 --> 00:56:48,710
it really looks like everything has
grown back together.

1241
00:56:49,320 --> 00:56:53,870
It's healed.
I just said that's some tron shit right

1242
00:56:53,871 --> 00:56:54,580
there,
dude.

1243
00:56:54,580 --> 00:56:58,490
I mean that's,
that's like to be able to reconstruct

1244
00:56:58,491 --> 00:57:01,970
something without having to go under the
knife for someone.

1245
00:57:02,030 --> 00:57:04,820
For me,
I went under the knife with my shoulder

1246
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:08,540
and I know that the difference in
recovery between

1247
00:57:10,130 --> 00:57:14,720
literally not being able to almost
function a part of your body entirely

1248
00:57:14,810 --> 00:57:19,810
versus them saying take it easy and work
your way back into what you want to do.

1249
00:57:22,260 --> 00:57:25,370
Those are two pair.
I mean they're like completely different

1250
00:57:25,371 --> 00:57:26,204
universes,
right?

1251
00:57:26,210 --> 00:57:28,820
Being in a situation where you're,
you know,

1252
00:57:28,850 --> 00:57:31,250
one,
you have to take painkillers,

1253
00:57:31,310 --> 00:57:35,960
which that's not cool to having to have
someone that you're dependent on,

1254
00:57:36,200 --> 00:57:38,540
you know,
pack pillows under your arm and keep you

1255
00:57:38,541 --> 00:57:42,490
steady for three days in bed and you
can't freaking move around.

1256
00:57:42,530 --> 00:57:43,790
Then you got this,
you know,

1257
00:57:43,791 --> 00:57:48,791
big wedge under your arm and you're
walking around versus we literally went

1258
00:57:49,221 --> 00:57:51,200
in,
went through the process,

1259
00:57:51,650 --> 00:57:54,890
get an ultrasound,
they find the place to target.

1260
00:57:55,160 --> 00:57:57,620
You see a syringe,
literally go in,

1261
00:57:57,621 --> 00:58:00,230
no different than if you go and get a
tetanus shot,

1262
00:58:00,260 --> 00:58:02,660
you could see it in the ultrasound.
You actually watch it go in,

1263
00:58:02,690 --> 00:58:04,580
it goes in,
comes out,

1264
00:58:04,581 --> 00:58:06,710
and then it's done.
You mean,

1265
00:58:06,730 --> 00:58:11,730
and you literally go home and you're in
these things just go to work.

1266
00:58:13,240 --> 00:58:14,020
Yeah,
I mean,

1267
00:58:14,020 --> 00:58:16,000
I'm really,
really hopeful for the future.

1268
00:58:16,210 --> 00:58:20,890
And we just went into this past weekend
a rottie looked at the MRI and uh,

1269
00:58:20,950 --> 00:58:24,190
he was stunned at the fact that my
rotator cuffs had been completely

1270
00:58:24,191 --> 00:58:28,630
healed,
but I still have some little tears in

1271
00:58:28,631 --> 00:58:32,200
the Labor area.
So we shot some right into the joint.

1272
00:58:32,680 --> 00:58:34,540
But again,
what they're calm,

1273
00:58:34,570 --> 00:58:38,260
they're constantly innovating.
So now they're using umbilical cord

1274
00:58:38,261 --> 00:58:42,440
blood
and apparently they're having massive

1275
00:58:42,441 --> 00:58:47,240
results with umbilical cord blood and
then they're using your blood and the

1276
00:58:47,241 --> 00:58:49,130
PRP.
That was cool.

1277
00:58:49,160 --> 00:58:51,260
It's crazy to watch the machine.
Very cool.

1278
00:58:51,261 --> 00:58:54,950
It mixes it all up and then it and puts
it with the stem cells and it's like

1279
00:58:55,580 --> 00:58:58,700
we're living in the future man.
Cause I almost feel like I got gypped

1280
00:59:00,200 --> 00:59:01,520
that,
you know what I mean by that?

1281
00:59:01,600 --> 00:59:02,820
Cause it healed you.
Yeah.

1282
00:59:02,930 --> 00:59:07,930
I mean I had a hard time carrying a jug
of milk with my right arm.

1283
00:59:09,140 --> 00:59:12,010
A lot of people found that hard to
believe because,

1284
00:59:12,250 --> 00:59:14,680
you know,
my arms aren't small,

1285
00:59:14,710 --> 00:59:16,810
I don't think in average.
But,

1286
00:59:16,811 --> 00:59:18,820
uh,
I had a tough,

1287
00:59:18,821 --> 00:59:23,810
tough time carrying a jug of milk and a
hammer fist position and then got the

1288
00:59:23,811 --> 00:59:26,280
Mri saw few,
you know,

1289
00:59:26,690 --> 00:59:31,690
actually three areas where I just pretty
much abuse it and tore it apart and got

1290
00:59:33,561 --> 00:59:37,610
those three injections the first time
two of them took,

1291
00:59:37,700 --> 00:59:40,970
I ended up,
actually roddy had me back there for a

1292
00:59:41,030 --> 00:59:46,030
Fox News thing because I sent him a
video of me doing 60 pound curls three,

1293
00:59:48,380 --> 00:59:53,380
three weeks after the first stem cell
injection and I wasn't even able to

1294
00:59:54,050 --> 00:59:57,740
carry a jug of milk and I was doing 60
pound curls for sets,

1295
00:59:57,770 --> 00:59:59,420
no pain,
no pain.

1296
00:59:59,870 --> 01:00:04,640
So I went there and did that.
Well then it ended up slowly coming back

1297
01:00:04,641 --> 01:00:08,180
where I felt pain in one area of the
three.

1298
01:00:08,450 --> 01:00:11,240
So I had a different,
I had an injection then,

1299
01:00:11,241 --> 01:00:15,650
but what I had at that time was what we
referred to as a baby dust.

1300
01:00:17,570 --> 01:00:18,860
But now,
um,

1301
01:00:19,100 --> 01:00:23,540
you and my wife Sharon had prp,
which was really,

1302
01:00:23,541 --> 01:00:27,080
really cool to see that machine work.
PRP mixed with stem cells.

1303
01:00:27,320 --> 01:00:28,520
That's right.
That's right.

1304
01:00:28,580 --> 01:00:32,210
So it's an actually,
the very first time I came in,

1305
01:00:32,600 --> 01:00:33,950
they had us,
um,

1306
01:00:35,090 --> 01:00:40,090
he asked me to do a light workout after,
but then the second time I came back,

1307
01:00:40,371 --> 01:00:42,770
he had me do a workout before.
Yeah.

1308
01:00:42,771 --> 01:00:44,660
He did that with me as well.
And then,

1309
01:00:44,690 --> 01:00:47,270
and then injected it.
And then we talked about the benefits of

1310
01:00:47,271 --> 01:00:49,850
like the sauna and what that would do
for it.

1311
01:00:49,880 --> 01:00:53,330
Yeah.
And then now it's already at a different

1312
01:00:53,331 --> 01:00:54,590
stage.
So I mean it's,

1313
01:00:54,591 --> 01:00:55,820
no,
there's no,

1314
01:00:55,821 --> 01:00:59,060
uh,
no doubt the progression of this is

1315
01:00:59,061 --> 01:01:00,680
just,
it's like anything,

1316
01:01:00,681 --> 01:01:02,840
it just gets better and better and
better and better.

1317
01:01:02,900 --> 01:01:05,480
What's interesting about rodey too,
what's great about Rodney,

1318
01:01:05,481 --> 01:01:06,770
I should say,
rather than interesting,

1319
01:01:06,771 --> 01:01:11,120
is that Roddy is a student of medical
science as well as a practicing

1320
01:01:11,121 --> 01:01:13,070
physician and surgeon.
It's a good point.

1321
01:01:13,100 --> 01:01:15,410
Yeah.
So he's constantly on all the latest

1322
01:01:15,411 --> 01:01:17,600
stuff.
He's not stagnant in any way,

1323
01:01:17,660 --> 01:01:19,520
shape or form.
He's constantly up on it.

1324
01:01:19,521 --> 01:01:21,350
So every time I have a conversation with
them,

1325
01:01:21,590 --> 01:01:23,630
he's like,
there's some new research coming out of

1326
01:01:23,631 --> 01:01:26,960
this place that shows this and he's just
constantly on the ball with it.

1327
01:01:27,260 --> 01:01:28,280
And so,
um,

1328
01:01:28,430 --> 01:01:30,980
the most latest thing was this weekend.
I mean,

1329
01:01:31,160 --> 01:01:33,230
last time I saw him was just a couple
months before.

1330
01:01:33,280 --> 01:01:36,230
It's definitely on point with the stats.
Yes.

1331
01:01:39,400 --> 01:01:41,100
Yeah.
We can't really match that on the

1332
01:01:41,101 --> 01:01:41,934
podcast.
Boy,

1333
01:01:42,510 --> 01:01:43,343
we were,
uh,

1334
01:01:43,560 --> 01:01:45,210
I was,
I had some speculation.

1335
01:01:45,211 --> 01:01:50,211
This activity's taking place in La and
Las Vegas rather on a daily basis what

1336
01:01:50,491 --> 01:01:51,324
they would be.
I was like,

1337
01:01:51,910 --> 01:01:56,370
my real big question was how many times
does a gay guy come in and other guy's

1338
01:01:56,371 --> 01:02:01,210
ass and yell out Woo in Vegas?
Oh,

1339
01:02:01,320 --> 01:02:04,590
how many times does he ric flair?
And Roddy was correct.

1340
01:02:04,591 --> 01:02:05,760
Roddy was like,
not every day.

1341
01:02:05,761 --> 01:02:06,930
And I think what,
I think you're right,

1342
01:02:07,140 --> 01:02:09,180
everybody else was like all day,
every day.

1343
01:02:09,181 --> 01:02:10,290
I'm like,
what are the odds?

1344
01:02:10,350 --> 01:02:11,670
Chamie just came alive.

1345
01:02:15,250 --> 01:02:16,600
This,
by the way,

1346
01:02:16,601 --> 01:02:19,920
this was at a very nice dinner.
We're good.

1347
01:02:19,921 --> 01:02:20,010
Is

1348
01:02:20,010 --> 01:02:22,080
that steak house?
It was very good.

1349
01:02:22,140 --> 01:02:22,561
Yeah.
The,

1350
01:02:22,561 --> 01:02:25,380
um,
shout out to craft steak at the mgm

1351
01:02:25,400 --> 01:02:27,430
grand chronometer was delicious.
So yeah,

1352
01:02:27,480 --> 01:02:32,390
games we were having some of the bay
best that Vegas could offer.

1353
01:02:32,400 --> 01:02:35,490
Meanwhile Joe got on some,
uh,

1354
01:02:35,580 --> 01:02:40,140
subjects that were probably only
probably only uh,

1355
01:02:41,460 --> 01:02:43,530
I dunno,
illegal to talk about in a comedy

1356
01:02:43,531 --> 01:02:45,540
situation.
You can talk about it anywhere now

1357
01:02:45,920 --> 01:02:48,360
for now,
for like the next couple of months and

1358
01:02:48,410 --> 01:02:49,760
then they'll make that illegal.
Yeah.

1359
01:02:49,940 --> 01:02:52,340
Yeah.
Vegas is a great place to get meals.

1360
01:02:52,820 --> 01:02:55,900
It's like one of the best restaurant
places in the country.

1361
01:02:55,920 --> 01:02:58,410
It really is.
I want a shout out to,

1362
01:02:58,411 --> 01:03:00,600
uh,
I want to hook up with Gordon Ramsay.

1363
01:03:00,630 --> 01:03:04,860
You did some,
you did some videos about hunting and

1364
01:03:04,861 --> 01:03:07,800
cooking wild game,
but you're missing out,

1365
01:03:07,801 --> 01:03:09,450
man.
You got to do this the right way.

1366
01:03:09,480 --> 01:03:10,313
Yeah,
that's wrong.

1367
01:03:11,140 --> 01:03:14,860
He's missing out on,
it was kind of a cheesy rifle hunt with

1368
01:03:14,861 --> 01:03:19,110
the hog.
But I think we can do way better.

1369
01:03:19,170 --> 01:03:21,360
And one,
I think he need to learn bow hunting

1370
01:03:21,361 --> 01:03:24,000
just because you're missing out if you
don't,

1371
01:03:25,170 --> 01:03:28,260
here's the problem.
Let me speak for Gordon Ramsay real

1372
01:03:28,261 --> 01:03:30,100
quick cause I met him,
I met him briefly in,

1373
01:03:30,101 --> 01:03:32,490
shook his hand and let's hear that.
I think I know him very well.

1374
01:03:33,280 --> 01:03:35,050
Let them for all 14,
15 seconds.

1375
01:03:35,650 --> 01:03:36,940
Uh,
he doesn't have the time,

1376
01:03:36,941 --> 01:03:38,800
man.
The guy's like 18 different TV shows.

1377
01:03:38,801 --> 01:03:41,950
I was watching them yell at some dude
who was cooking somewhere.

1378
01:03:42,190 --> 01:03:43,930
He was yelling.
Uh,

1379
01:03:44,080 --> 01:03:48,430
oddly enough the guy was cooking elk and
Gordon was complaining about the elk.

1380
01:03:48,431 --> 01:03:51,440
It was complaining about it being tough
and it is inevitable.

1381
01:03:51,460 --> 01:03:54,400
Good complaint.
And the guy aided,

1382
01:03:54,430 --> 01:03:56,680
he's chewing on and he said his tender
and delicious.

1383
01:03:56,920 --> 01:04:00,910
I'm more with the guy.
I think Gordon got a little,

1384
01:04:01,030 --> 01:04:03,300
he's doing a TV show up man.
Oh yeah.

1385
01:04:03,310 --> 01:04:05,170
I don't want to be cynical.
Is playing a character.

1386
01:04:05,290 --> 01:04:07,780
I don't want to be cynical,
but there's a re,

1387
01:04:07,810 --> 01:04:10,450
first of all,
the guy did step way over the line.

1388
01:04:10,660 --> 01:04:14,800
He said he was trained by some of the
greatest chefs in Europe and then Gordon

1389
01:04:14,800 --> 01:04:16,840
Ramsey called him on and he said,
I never said that.

1390
01:04:16,990 --> 01:04:18,700
And then they had video,
they played back.

1391
01:04:18,820 --> 01:04:21,670
So that guy's obviously a dildo.
And then on top of that,

1392
01:04:22,180 --> 01:04:24,700
unfortunately buddy,
sometimes in life we're delta.

1393
01:04:24,701 --> 01:04:26,950
I've been Deldot,
I've been a deldot more than once.

1394
01:04:27,940 --> 01:04:32,110
People know I haven't been deldot,
but I have been one not that way.

1395
01:04:32,111 --> 01:04:35,320
Not In the actual mechanical sense.
Anyway,

1396
01:04:35,321 --> 01:04:38,110
this guy was trying to explain,
um,

1397
01:04:38,170 --> 01:04:38,980
you know,
led,

1398
01:04:38,980 --> 01:04:41,410
he's not a chef,
but then there was video footage of him

1399
01:04:41,411 --> 01:04:45,100
saying that he was a chef.
But the bottom line is Gordon Ramsey,

1400
01:04:45,101 --> 01:04:49,270
he's playing it up and he's like talking
about how terrible the food is and

1401
01:04:49,271 --> 01:04:50,140
chatting on.
I'm like,

1402
01:04:50,141 --> 01:04:53,410
that's his show.
His show was about sort of like kitchen

1403
01:04:53,411 --> 01:04:55,570
nightmares.
It's like I show up and you show has to

1404
01:04:55,571 --> 01:04:57,700
be,
your kitchen has to be a nightmare for

1405
01:04:57,701 --> 01:04:59,110
kitchen nightmares.
T to work.

1406
01:04:59,111 --> 01:04:59,650
That's the guy.

1407
01:04:59,650 --> 01:05:01,540
That's the gentleman.
We don't need to play this guy.

1408
01:05:01,660 --> 01:05:04,420
I don't want to shame this young man,
this young man.

1409
01:05:04,421 --> 01:05:05,860
He's on the young man.
That's a shame.

1410
01:05:05,861 --> 01:05:08,020
This guy shit all over.
Awesome.

1411
01:05:08,230 --> 01:05:12,070
But don't you think this is a lot like a
guy who doesn't really know archery

1412
01:05:12,820 --> 01:05:16,290
talking shit to you?
Like your Gordon Ramsay and that guy's

1413
01:05:16,310 --> 01:05:17,310
guy who,
you know,

1414
01:05:17,330 --> 01:05:20,200
I've been finger shooting my whole life.
I don't need a release.

1415
01:05:20,670 --> 01:05:22,720
You know,
I don't use a site because I shoot

1416
01:05:22,721 --> 01:05:24,040
instinctive.
And you're like,

1417
01:05:24,041 --> 01:05:25,810
well,
you're just not going to be accurate.

1418
01:05:25,880 --> 01:05:26,381
And you're like,
no,

1419
01:05:26,381 --> 01:05:28,030
I'm accurate,
I'm accurate.

1420
01:05:28,180 --> 01:05:30,160
And then he shoots and he misses the
target and you're like,

1421
01:05:30,161 --> 01:05:31,630
see,
I told Ya and then,

1422
01:05:31,631 --> 01:05:35,080
but you're a nice guy.
Gordon Ramsey is a professional asshole.

1423
01:05:35,320 --> 01:05:38,770
And I don't mean that in a bad way,
but I mean when someone fucks up,

1424
01:05:38,800 --> 01:05:41,140
that guy comes down and you with the
hammer of truth,

1425
01:05:42,340 --> 01:05:43,630
it's brutal to watch.

1426
01:05:44,320 --> 01:05:46,120
My seven year old was so annoyed at me.
She's like,

1427
01:05:46,121 --> 01:05:49,530
why are you still watching this?
Because we were in the morning,

1428
01:05:50,020 --> 01:05:52,630
she's someone else.
She wanted a roll around on the

1429
01:05:52,631 --> 01:05:54,700
hoverboards and I was like,
just relax one second.

1430
01:05:54,701 --> 01:05:57,030
I want to see where this goes.
Because they were,

1431
01:05:57,160 --> 01:06:00,880
the guy was like talking about Gordon
Ramsey did not know how to cook elk.

1432
01:06:01,590 --> 01:06:03,760
All right.
But then I was watching him cook calc.

1433
01:06:03,761 --> 01:06:04,541
I'm like,
Ooh,

1434
01:06:04,541 --> 01:06:06,970
I don't think you know.
See,

1435
01:06:06,971 --> 01:06:09,010
that's what I mean.
He needs to learn.

1436
01:06:09,670 --> 01:06:14,140
But here's my argument.
You don't have time for archery there.

1437
01:06:15,280 --> 01:06:16,600
Yeah,
but I'm crazy.

1438
01:06:17,080 --> 01:06:19,190
Exactly.
I have a real many,

1439
01:06:19,600 --> 01:06:21,130
I need,
I need,

1440
01:06:21,340 --> 01:06:23,080
uh,
need Gordon to get crazy.

1441
01:06:23,800 --> 01:06:26,320
He's not going to do it.
It's not the same guy.

1442
01:06:27,400 --> 01:06:29,830
I think he goes at archery.
Find the people that you don't want to

1443
01:06:29,831 --> 01:06:30,670
think.
Actually,

1444
01:06:30,671 --> 01:06:32,860
it's like a game of Tetris,
right.

1445
01:06:33,190 --> 01:06:34,870
As well,
falling in place.

1446
01:06:34,871 --> 01:06:36,520
You've got to figure out where it falls
in place.

1447
01:06:36,700 --> 01:06:39,070
You can't foresee English.
So Gordon,

1448
01:06:39,370 --> 01:06:39,941
Oh,
same thing.

1449
01:06:39,941 --> 01:06:41,770
Give it a try.
Basically the same thing.

1450
01:06:41,800 --> 01:06:42,820
Yup.
Right.

1451
01:06:43,090 --> 01:06:44,370
Yeah.
Um,

1452
01:06:44,590 --> 01:06:45,850
that's her,
that's her.

1453
01:06:46,150 --> 01:06:48,940
I mean,
she was completely,

1454
01:06:48,970 --> 01:06:53,320
she had no,
literally no perspective to hunting

1455
01:06:53,440 --> 01:06:55,270
before we met.
I mean,

1456
01:06:55,271 --> 01:06:57,880
imagine Sharon and I met on a plane to
France.

1457
01:06:58,600 --> 01:07:01,720
We met again on the plane back from
France.

1458
01:07:02,530 --> 01:07:05,800
She was from England.
I was from the u s I just happened to be

1459
01:07:05,801 --> 01:07:08,770
routing through Liverpool.
I said,

1460
01:07:08,771 --> 01:07:09,604
I appreciate,
we talked,

1461
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:11,620
might not have talked about it on the
podcast,

1462
01:07:11,621 --> 01:07:13,180
but I think did I think,
I mean,

1463
01:07:13,181 --> 01:07:14,410
uh,
but it's a great story.

1464
01:07:14,440 --> 01:07:16,090
Yeah.
It is a very good story,

1465
01:07:16,091 --> 01:07:16,871
better.
And then you're like,

1466
01:07:16,871 --> 01:07:17,860
damn,
why didn't get her number?

1467
01:07:17,861 --> 01:07:19,750
And then you met her again.
Hollywood.

1468
01:07:20,200 --> 01:07:22,660
We need a movie called love at first
flight.

1469
01:07:23,020 --> 01:07:25,790
This is it.
You can uh,

1470
01:07:25,870 --> 01:07:29,800
have nicholas cage play an archer.
But I'm just going to go out on a limb

1471
01:07:29,801 --> 01:07:33,820
which say terrible job.
She is from England does not mean that

1472
01:07:33,821 --> 01:07:37,930
they're the same thing that him and her
just like already laying is also from

1473
01:07:37,931 --> 01:07:41,980
America and he is not as same as me.
We are different.

1474
01:07:43,630 --> 01:07:47,470
He has way more experience with
pharmaceutical drugs and heroin.

1475
01:07:47,680 --> 01:07:51,730
And I have a more experience shooting
animals with a pole and Arrow and it

1476
01:07:51,740 --> 01:07:53,610
will always be such,
yeah,

1477
01:07:53,620 --> 01:07:55,480
do whatever you want to do in this life.
You know,

1478
01:07:55,510 --> 01:07:58,690
I don't think he needs to go out and
hunt with a bow and arrow.

1479
01:07:59,370 --> 01:08:02,830
The one thing is it would require a
tremendous learning curve.

1480
01:08:03,610 --> 01:08:07,090
Right?
Especially like my first experiences

1481
01:08:07,091 --> 01:08:08,080
were,
uh,

1482
01:08:08,320 --> 01:08:12,670
bears over Bait,
which is a much easier proposition.

1483
01:08:12,700 --> 01:08:15,830
It's a very controlled situation.
But is,

1484
01:08:16,310 --> 01:08:18,200
I mean,
I think controlled situations are

1485
01:08:18,201 --> 01:08:19,820
important for any beginner.
Yeah.

1486
01:08:19,830 --> 01:08:21,380
It doesn't matter.
Sure.

1487
01:08:21,490 --> 01:08:22,323
Right.
Sparring,

1488
01:08:22,460 --> 01:08:27,110
when you teach people how to fight,
one of the first things I suggest always

1489
01:08:27,160 --> 01:08:29,870
they spar and advanced belt.
They spar.

1490
01:08:29,880 --> 01:08:31,290
Someone's not going to hurt them.
Well,

1491
01:08:31,310 --> 01:08:34,820
mark talked about that at dinner.
We talked about a sparring.

1492
01:08:34,910 --> 01:08:35,810
Yes.
Right.

1493
01:08:35,990 --> 01:08:37,010
Yeah.
And we can,

1494
01:08:37,100 --> 01:08:38,990
you can read it.
Mark and I,

1495
01:08:39,160 --> 01:08:39,881
we,
we,

1496
01:08:39,881 --> 01:08:41,690
we haven't asked the brain.
Yeah.

1497
01:08:42,230 --> 01:08:43,400
Mark and I actually,
uh,

1498
01:08:43,430 --> 01:08:45,410
I,
I played a video for him that I was

1499
01:08:45,411 --> 01:08:46,610
really disturbed about.
We,

1500
01:08:46,710 --> 01:08:48,380
we actually played it yesterday on the
podcast.

1501
01:08:48,560 --> 01:08:50,180
Did you have,
it's a heavy virgil.

1502
01:08:50,200 --> 01:08:51,620
I haven't watched it yet.
No.

1503
01:08:51,621 --> 01:08:54,160
Yesterday wasn't surgical.
Brendan Shab and Brian Kale,

1504
01:08:54,930 --> 01:08:56,360
we talked about,
um,

1505
01:08:57,110 --> 01:09:00,530
heavy sparring that there's guys that
are hitting each other as hard as they

1506
01:09:00,531 --> 01:09:02,300
possibly can.
And all that is,

1507
01:09:02,301 --> 01:09:03,560
is like an ego exercise.

1508
01:09:03,560 --> 01:09:05,630
You're not,
you're not getting better.

1509
01:09:05,720 --> 01:09:08,600
You're hurting each other.
You're fucking each other's brains up.

1510
01:09:09,260 --> 01:09:12,470
And Mark and I were talking about that,
like how many guys get turned off to

1511
01:09:12,471 --> 01:09:16,910
sparring because they spar with someone
who just beats the shit out of him in a

1512
01:09:16,911 --> 01:09:21,710
bad gym rather than spars with someone
who teaches you just to get touched.

1513
01:09:21,760 --> 01:09:23,960
You just get touched in the face.
So you know you got hit,

1514
01:09:24,260 --> 01:09:27,080
you know,
and someone who's fast but has control

1515
01:09:27,290 --> 01:09:30,760
and then you learn how to operate
without the,

1516
01:09:31,010 --> 01:09:34,970
the fear and consequences of like a wild
Jim Brawl,

1517
01:09:35,000 --> 01:09:37,700
which is like really common.
A lot of gyms,

1518
01:09:37,730 --> 01:09:41,420
they have brawls where it should be just
sparring,

1519
01:09:41,421 --> 01:09:43,730
but instead you're really just fighting
all the time.

1520
01:09:43,731 --> 01:09:46,340
You're fighting constantly.
Those people always wind up with brain

1521
01:09:46,341 --> 01:09:48,410
damage,
like almost always.

1522
01:09:48,950 --> 01:09:53,030
So Real,
real issue with a lot of,

1523
01:09:53,050 --> 01:09:56,930
um,
low level gyms or gyms where people

1524
01:09:56,931 --> 01:10:00,290
haven't really considered the
consequences of their actions.

1525
01:10:00,440 --> 01:10:01,850
Did you uh,
yeah.

1526
01:10:01,851 --> 01:10:04,820
That's fine.
Did you play that video that you showed

1527
01:10:05,060 --> 01:10:07,250
when we were at dinner?
The other guy get knocked out?

1528
01:10:07,340 --> 01:10:08,240
Is that what it want?
Yeah,

1529
01:10:08,241 --> 01:10:09,170
that's the one.
Yeah.

1530
01:10:09,530 --> 01:10:10,640
Yeah.
Mark was like,

1531
01:10:10,670 --> 01:10:13,880
this would never happen at his gym.
Never happened.

1532
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:16,100
Mark's amazing.
I think it's important.

1533
01:10:16,130 --> 01:10:17,360
I mean,
any type of,

1534
01:10:17,780 --> 01:10:22,780
any type of beginner needs a controlled
situation and you need training wheels.

1535
01:10:23,121 --> 01:10:24,290
I mean,
yeah,

1536
01:10:24,590 --> 01:10:29,590
it's important and there's that feeling,
well this is what I've been preaching

1537
01:10:29,661 --> 01:10:32,870
forever,
is that feeling of not knowing how to do

1538
01:10:32,871 --> 01:10:35,630
something and trying to figure it out is
crucial.

1539
01:10:36,110 --> 01:10:39,020
As a human being,
I think we're human stagnate.

1540
01:10:39,200 --> 01:10:42,290
That feeling makes people feel weird.
They don't like being a loser.

1541
01:10:42,320 --> 01:10:44,180
They don't like being a beginner.
They don't like it.

1542
01:10:44,600 --> 01:10:49,600
But I think that feeling is crucial
because when you get really good at

1543
01:10:50,241 --> 01:10:55,010
something and you get stagnant and you,
you don't worry about it anymore,

1544
01:10:55,011 --> 01:10:56,660
there's no growth,
there's no movement.

1545
01:10:56,990 --> 01:10:59,930
You know?
There's something about that that's very

1546
01:10:59,931 --> 01:11:04,931
detrimental to the human psyche.
It's very detrimental to your growth and

1547
01:11:05,271 --> 01:11:09,740
your a constant self examination,
which a lot of people don't like,

1548
01:11:09,800 --> 01:11:11,860
but I think is important.
This is why I think it's,

1549
01:11:11,970 --> 01:11:15,660
I think it's important for peace of mind
because I think it may bring rocky

1550
01:11:15,661 --> 01:11:20,190
moments where you,
you don't like what you find and you

1551
01:11:20,191 --> 01:11:21,090
just feel like,
God,

1552
01:11:21,091 --> 01:11:23,850
can I just just,
just be cool with everything and real.

1553
01:11:24,210 --> 01:11:28,350
But I think through that path,
those rocky moments,

1554
01:11:28,351 --> 01:11:33,351
you get to understand yourself in a very
pure way versus understanding the

1555
01:11:36,091 --> 01:11:39,060
projection of who you would like people
to think you are,

1556
01:11:39,360 --> 01:11:43,260
which is what most people exist in.
Most people exist in this world of

1557
01:11:43,290 --> 01:11:48,290
slippery shoes and shiny fucking cars
and ties and wearing the right things

1558
01:11:50,371 --> 01:11:53,610
and saying the right things.
All those things are sort of designed to

1559
01:11:53,611 --> 01:11:56,700
project an image that's not necessarily
you.

1560
01:11:57,060 --> 01:12:00,960
It's a cheap way of getting people to
think greater of you.

1561
01:12:01,740 --> 01:12:05,720
Whereas the only way that people think
that the really know who you are is see

1562
01:12:05,721 --> 01:12:08,060
you doing something hard,
see,

1563
01:12:08,061 --> 01:12:10,380
see you doing something difficult.
They don't know who you are.

1564
01:12:10,381 --> 01:12:13,740
If you show up and the,
the camera's start flash and you're on

1565
01:12:13,741 --> 01:12:15,660
the red car,
but you're in the perfect suit,

1566
01:12:15,661 --> 01:12:18,390
you hop out of a limo.
You've got a gorgeous girl and your arm

1567
01:12:18,420 --> 01:12:20,790
don't know Jack Shit about that.
It looks amazing.

1568
01:12:20,791 --> 01:12:22,770
I'd like to be that guy.
Everybody would,

1569
01:12:22,980 --> 01:12:24,840
but they don't know God damn thing about
you,

1570
01:12:24,990 --> 01:12:29,990
but if they saw you at mile 59 of a 200
mile race and you're shitting yourself

1571
01:12:30,691 --> 01:12:32,910
over a cactus in the middle of the
funnel,

1572
01:12:33,390 --> 01:12:35,580
in the middle of the mountains,
the campaigns,

1573
01:12:35,880 --> 01:12:40,440
then then they would know who you really
are and I think this is also one of the

1574
01:12:40,441 --> 01:12:41,700
reasons why a guy like you,

1575
01:12:42,330 --> 01:12:46,260
you're hesitant close to yes,
my litmus sex is hunting.

1576
01:12:46,810 --> 01:12:47,940
Well it's,
I mean not hard.

1577
01:12:48,420 --> 01:12:52,500
If I'm,
if I ever really am at a point where I

1578
01:12:52,501 --> 01:12:57,501
feel like is this going to be a
legitimate friend or is this going to be

1579
01:12:59,280 --> 01:13:03,270
someone that I just do business with,
then that's,

1580
01:13:03,630 --> 01:13:08,630
that's where I test it is in something
tough because those people,

1581
01:13:10,890 --> 01:13:13,170
to me,
those people put themselves,

1582
01:13:15,120 --> 01:13:19,890
you're probably the same.
There's maybe six or seven people that I

1583
01:13:19,891 --> 01:13:24,810
talk to on a daily basis and then
there's like a different tier to that,

1584
01:13:25,530 --> 01:13:27,950
but that is my litmus test.
If,

1585
01:13:27,970 --> 01:13:32,970
if people can can do those things and
really proved themselves like at the

1586
01:13:34,171 --> 01:13:34,951
tough,
tough,

1587
01:13:34,951 --> 01:13:36,900
tough times.
If you handle it.

1588
01:13:36,960 --> 01:13:38,190
Yeah.
If they can handle it.

1589
01:13:38,191 --> 01:13:39,690
Those are the people that I want around
me.

1590
01:13:39,691 --> 01:13:43,120
That's the tree for fuel,
right know.

1591
01:13:43,440 --> 01:13:45,420
Yeah,
because when you're ready to be like,

1592
01:13:48,150 --> 01:13:50,610
should I just take a break right now and
they're still going.

1593
01:13:50,650 --> 01:13:53,000
You're like,
I'm not going to let him beat me cause

1594
01:13:53,001 --> 01:13:56,580
he was going to ride me at the end.
Have you seen ever seen Jockos video?

1595
01:13:56,970 --> 01:13:59,340
It's just called good.
Ah,

1596
01:13:59,470 --> 01:14:02,320
you haven't seen it play at Jamie.
Find that.

1597
01:14:02,650 --> 01:14:05,530
It's one of my favorite videos on the
Internet.

1598
01:14:05,710 --> 01:14:07,300
There's a lot of videos on the Internet.

1599
01:14:07,970 --> 01:14:12,140
Crazy isn't the world that Jacko and I
met in

1600
01:14:12,160 --> 01:14:14,380
an,
we literally pass each other in an

1601
01:14:14,381 --> 01:14:15,820
airport.
Pretty crazy.

1602
01:14:15,880 --> 01:14:18,820
Took,
we both had a just enough time to take a

1603
01:14:18,821 --> 01:14:22,720
selfie and we texted it to you.
Remember that?

1604
01:14:22,780 --> 01:14:24,450
Yes.
Yeah.

1605
01:14:24,480 --> 01:14:25,710
It was amazing.
Let's,

1606
01:14:25,720 --> 01:14:28,750
we're going to play it because this one
thing I know the Jocko would never flag

1607
01:14:28,751 --> 01:14:29,584
us off youtube.

1608
01:14:29,840 --> 01:14:33,530
One of my direct subordinates,
one of my guys that worked for me,

1609
01:14:33,590 --> 01:14:36,290
he would,
he would call me up or pull me aside

1610
01:14:36,291 --> 01:14:40,160
with some major problem,
some issue that was going on and he'd

1611
01:14:40,161 --> 01:14:40,540
say,
boss,

1612
01:14:40,540 --> 01:14:42,080
we got this and that and the other
thing.

1613
01:14:42,290 --> 01:14:44,240
And I look at him and I'd say,
good.

1614
01:14:45,590 --> 01:14:49,460
And finally one day he was telling me
about some issue that he was having some

1615
01:14:49,461 --> 01:14:52,840
problem and he said,
I already know what you're going to say.

1616
01:14:54,140 --> 01:14:54,551
I said,
well,

1617
01:14:54,551 --> 01:14:56,320
what am I going to say?
You said you're going to say good.

1618
01:14:56,430 --> 01:14:57,850
Uh,

1619
01:14:59,120 --> 01:15:00,800
he said,
that's what you always say when

1620
01:15:00,801 --> 01:15:05,210
something is wrong in going bad.
You always just look at me and say good.

1621
01:15:07,490 --> 01:15:08,151
And I said,
well,

1622
01:15:08,151 --> 01:15:13,151
yeah,
when things are going bad there's going

1623
01:15:13,261 --> 01:15:15,770
to be some good that's going to come
from it.

1624
01:15:17,010 --> 01:15:19,530
Didn't get the new high speed gear we
wanted.

1625
01:15:20,130 --> 01:15:21,810
Good,
didn't get promoted.

1626
01:15:26,930 --> 01:15:28,130
Oh,
mission got canceled.

1627
01:15:28,840 --> 01:15:30,050
Good.
We can focus on our own,

1628
01:15:30,590 --> 01:15:33,260
didn't get funded,
didn't get the job you wanted.

1629
01:15:34,550 --> 01:15:36,500
Got Injured,
sprained my ankle,

1630
01:15:36,710 --> 01:15:37,910
got tapped out.
Good,

1631
01:15:38,900 --> 01:15:43,900
got beat.
Unexpected problems.

1632
01:15:47,810 --> 01:15:51,170
We have the opportunity to figure out a
solution.

1633
01:15:53,070 --> 01:15:55,140
That's it.
When things are going bad,

1634
01:15:56,670 --> 01:15:57,750
don't get all bummed out.

1635
01:15:57,800 --> 01:15:59,840
Don't get startled.
Don't get frustrated.

1636
01:16:04,450 --> 01:16:08,900
If you can say the word good,
guess what

1637
01:16:10,410 --> 01:16:11,690
need.
You're still alive.

1638
01:16:12,580 --> 01:16:15,100
It meets.
You're still grieving and if you're

1639
01:16:15,101 --> 01:16:20,101
still breathing,
you still got some fight left it.

1640
01:16:22,080 --> 01:16:23,400
Come on,
get up,

1641
01:16:24,780 --> 01:16:27,520
dust off,
reload,

1642
01:16:28,630 --> 01:16:32,350
recalibrate,
reengage.

1643
01:16:34,240 --> 01:16:36,220
Go out on the attack.
Come on

1644
01:16:36,400 --> 01:16:38,130
Sun.
Dang.

1645
01:16:38,400 --> 01:16:40,100
If that doesn't make you find out,
oh,

1646
01:16:40,200 --> 01:16:44,730
you need to go to a doctor.
Can people hear that on the podcast?

1647
01:16:44,910 --> 01:16:49,080
If like downloading the itunes that hear
that for sure.

1648
01:16:49,081 --> 01:16:50,040
Yeah,
we're playing that.

1649
01:16:50,430 --> 01:16:52,380
Listen,
if you listen to an empty friends in

1650
01:16:52,381 --> 01:16:53,910
here,
I'd punch someone in the face,

1651
01:16:53,911 --> 01:16:56,730
right?
I want to shoot a broadhead through

1652
01:16:56,731 --> 01:17:00,840
someone's neck.
That's what Jocko is all about.

1653
01:17:00,841 --> 01:17:01,740
Man.
When I run,

1654
01:17:01,770 --> 01:17:04,470
I literally hear that sometimes when I'm
fucking exhausted,

1655
01:17:04,471 --> 01:17:06,690
I'm going to hit the high hills.
Never ran to that.

1656
01:17:06,691 --> 01:17:07,524
If I did,
I'd,

1657
01:17:07,680 --> 01:17:11,120
I wouldn't even be here right now.
Die of a heart attack somewhere out of

1658
01:17:11,121 --> 01:17:15,500
fricking had a cardiac arrest.
I don't listen to it too.

1659
01:17:15,620 --> 01:17:18,330
When I run because I really believe that
listening to music when you're running

1660
01:17:18,331 --> 01:17:20,510
is cheating.
Why?

1661
01:17:21,380 --> 01:17:23,060
Why try?
Cause that's easier.

1662
01:17:23,410 --> 01:17:25,430
Are you kidding?
I'm serious.

1663
01:17:25,431 --> 01:17:27,320
Yeah.
Well I think that when you run,

1664
01:17:27,350 --> 01:17:30,260
it should be in your mind.
You should be,

1665
01:17:30,380 --> 01:17:33,830
you're such an issue with your thoughts
alone.

1666
01:17:33,860 --> 01:17:35,840
And I think that when you run and you
listen to music,

1667
01:17:35,841 --> 01:17:37,870
it's easier.
Therefore it's cheating.

1668
01:17:40,770 --> 01:17:44,560
I'm pissed right now.
Last time,

1669
01:17:44,800 --> 01:17:49,760
two homos running with your walkmans
with your ear plugs on.

1670
01:17:50,360 --> 01:17:51,860
Alright,
go five miles.

1671
01:17:51,861 --> 01:17:54,200
Then their ear buds.
You think it's different?

1672
01:17:54,890 --> 01:17:57,350
It's different to go two miles and five
miles to do.

1673
01:17:57,351 --> 01:17:58,940
You need,
I can do two miles in 20 minutes.

1674
01:17:58,990 --> 01:18:00,710
Right?
But can you do two miles in the hills?

1675
01:18:01,010 --> 01:18:04,700
Tribe miles is probably easier to to,
it's just overall,

1676
01:18:04,701 --> 01:18:06,590
it's as longer distracting an hour.
Right?

1677
01:18:06,620 --> 01:18:08,240
So you have to listen to music.
You,

1678
01:18:08,241 --> 01:18:09,860
Brittany Spears gets you through the
last three.

1679
01:18:09,920 --> 01:18:12,970
Don't have to,
it helps with like the mind games.

1680
01:18:13,180 --> 01:18:14,300
Sure.
I'm sure.

1681
01:18:14,330 --> 01:18:15,740
But that's the whole idea.
It's cheating.

1682
01:18:16,310 --> 01:18:18,980
I'm pissed.
So I was wearing shoes then.

1683
01:18:19,520 --> 01:18:20,353
Yes,
you're right.

1684
01:18:20,480 --> 01:18:21,380
You're right.
It is wearing.

1685
01:18:21,800 --> 01:18:24,320
Wearing shoes is cheating.
What?

1686
01:18:24,560 --> 01:18:25,430
Yeah,
you should be careful.

1687
01:18:25,431 --> 01:18:27,770
Here we go.
We were watching a video the other day

1688
01:18:27,771 --> 01:18:29,360
that Jamie almost made me throw up.

1689
01:18:29,360 --> 01:18:32,930
It was a dude who was carving off of his
callouses with a knife.

1690
01:18:33,500 --> 01:18:36,650
He had cows that were so thick.
He had a knife out and he was carving

1691
01:18:36,651 --> 01:18:38,720
the cows off and then a dog was eating
them.

1692
01:18:39,500 --> 01:18:41,690
Well,
I don't know about the dog eating part,

1693
01:18:41,720 --> 01:18:45,260
but I've definitely carved up calluses.
Ever seen counselors like this?

1694
01:18:45,530 --> 01:18:46,130
I mean,
I dunno.

1695
01:18:46,130 --> 01:18:49,730
This guy looked like he'd been walking
barefoot for several years.

1696
01:18:49,760 --> 01:18:53,300
I'm just pissed because last time I was
here you talked about the fact

1697
01:18:55,050 --> 01:18:58,430
that's it.
Would I talk about last?

1698
01:18:58,431 --> 01:19:00,530
Do we have that coin flipped over
saying,

1699
01:19:00,531 --> 01:19:01,430
yes,
please.

1700
01:19:01,550 --> 01:19:03,880
Oh,
the Brazilian Shahaz Korea coin.

1701
01:19:04,270 --> 01:19:05,410
Look at this.
Look at this.

1702
01:19:05,430 --> 01:19:06,470
Fucking,
come on.

1703
01:19:06,471 --> 01:19:11,210
Look at this.
It carving off chunks of his callous

1704
01:19:11,390 --> 01:19:14,870
with a fucking knife dude,
and the dog's going to eat that.

1705
01:19:15,350 --> 01:19:19,800
Of course he will says,
man cuts calluses off his foot with

1706
01:19:20,060 --> 01:19:20,680
calyces.

1707
01:19:20,680 --> 01:19:25,190
That's all dead foot like Mr Deeds is on
youtube right now.

1708
01:19:25,310 --> 01:19:26,960
He's moving around though.
He's alive.

1709
01:19:27,020 --> 01:19:27,800
Look at that.
Look at this.

1710
01:19:27,800 --> 01:19:28,521
Look at this.
Look at this.

1711
01:19:28,521 --> 01:19:30,170
Look at this.
Come on son.

1712
01:19:30,640 --> 01:19:32,640
It's got a goddamn fillet knife.
She,

1713
01:19:32,650 --> 01:19:36,050
anyone who's anyone who's watching with
the podcast,

1714
01:19:36,390 --> 01:19:39,650
anyone who's listening to this podcast
bring up please youtube.

1715
01:19:39,651 --> 01:19:43,160
This dog dog's going to eat it.
That's a starving dog.

1716
01:19:43,190 --> 01:19:45,950
I liked that.
Beagle dogs confused.

1717
01:19:46,340 --> 01:19:47,173
It's like,
am I?

1718
01:19:47,320 --> 01:19:49,670
He's like,
is this blue cheese or is this humans?

1719
01:19:50,030 --> 01:19:52,370
It's this blue cheese.
There's just a little trimmed.

1720
01:19:53,900 --> 01:19:56,270
It's a hard video to get over.
I thought I saw that video.

1721
01:19:56,480 --> 01:19:59,300
I had to take a leak at like five
o'clock in the morning.

1722
01:19:59,660 --> 01:20:01,250
I try.
I always do this,

1723
01:20:01,251 --> 01:20:02,180
man.
I was,

1724
01:20:02,181 --> 01:20:04,880
I'm thirsty at night and I'm like,
you shouldn't drink because if you drink

1725
01:20:05,060 --> 01:20:06,260
then you going to wake up in the middle
of the night.

1726
01:20:06,260 --> 01:20:07,860
You're going to have to pee.
You know that thing,

1727
01:20:08,010 --> 01:20:09,090
but on my bed,
I'm thirsty.

1728
01:20:09,150 --> 01:20:10,650
Fuck it.
I'll deal with that later.

1729
01:20:10,800 --> 01:20:12,060
I'm going to live in the moment kind of
guy.

1730
01:20:12,120 --> 01:20:14,850
Oh yeah,
and if I've got your pen and all I'm

1731
01:20:14,851 --> 01:20:17,070
thinking about when I'm painting,
I'm shaking my head thinking about that

1732
01:20:17,071 --> 01:20:20,790
dude chopping cows is off his foot with
a goddamn cleaver.

1733
01:20:21,480 --> 01:20:23,430
I like that.
I think they could serve that with a

1734
01:20:23,431 --> 01:20:27,220
cheese plate.
That guy probably runs barefoot like,

1735
01:20:27,560 --> 01:20:30,600
well,
last time I was here serious calcis you

1736
01:20:30,601 --> 01:20:35,070
talk to me about having kettlebells and
random places so that as you walk by him

1737
01:20:35,071 --> 01:20:36,900
you can just grab them,
do a few sets,

1738
01:20:37,200 --> 01:20:38,550
go to failure,
right?

1739
01:20:38,840 --> 01:20:42,630
Yeah.
Now you're fricking running with no

1740
01:20:42,631 --> 01:20:46,470
music because it makes it tough or yeah.
I don't want to be a pussy.

1741
01:20:47,130 --> 01:20:50,490
All those people running with music.
You heard me?

1742
01:20:52,260 --> 01:20:55,320
People listen to the Rogan podcasts
right now while they're running.

1743
01:20:55,500 --> 01:20:56,333
Turn it off.

1744
01:20:58,890 --> 01:21:02,970
So some kidding Jesus Christ.
I don't really think your pussy.

1745
01:21:02,971 --> 01:21:05,430
I listened to music all the time when
I'm on an elliptical machine.

1746
01:21:05,431 --> 01:21:09,510
If that makes you feel better.
You told James Hatfield but Hetfield

1747
01:21:09,540 --> 01:21:14,540
that you listened to his podcasts that
more or is a new record that morning

1748
01:21:14,740 --> 01:21:15,810
until you,
you're working out?

1749
01:21:15,870 --> 01:21:16,810
I did,
yeah.

1750
01:21:16,830 --> 01:21:19,110
It was in the gym lifting.
That's your pussy.

1751
01:21:21,530 --> 01:21:23,980
It came from a town make that mongoose
bike.

1752
01:21:27,000 --> 01:21:29,070
I like the fact that we talk is still
going hard.

1753
01:21:29,180 --> 01:21:32,570
I mean they like 85 years old.
I went to their concert and I will,

1754
01:21:33,570 --> 01:21:37,080
my buddy torsten,
his wife Trina,

1755
01:21:37,770 --> 01:21:41,460
she works for q prime,
hooked me up on some tickets to the

1756
01:21:41,461 --> 01:21:46,461
metallica concert in Iowa dam and they
freaking rocked.

1757
01:21:48,060 --> 01:21:52,200
See what does this,
this guy him from metallica on the world

1758
01:21:52,201 --> 01:21:55,920
wide tour.
Get rid of the Goddamn pop up son of a

1759
01:21:55,921 --> 01:21:56,550
bitch.

1760
01:21:56,550 --> 01:21:58,200
I know.
What is this?

1761
01:21:58,201 --> 01:22:01,080
Jim Brewer is actually the one who oh,
there he is.

1762
01:22:01,140 --> 01:22:02,210
Oh,
another popup.

1763
01:22:02,250 --> 01:22:03,780
Jesus Christ.
Welcome to the world.

1764
01:22:03,781 --> 01:22:04,950
We live in.
Pop it.

1765
01:22:04,980 --> 01:22:07,770
People are so greedy.
Crazy.

1766
01:22:07,771 --> 01:22:11,070
Yesterday Sharon was looking,
cause I'm still,

1767
01:22:11,250 --> 01:22:15,210
I still have my real wedding ring on the
wedding ring.

1768
01:22:15,270 --> 01:22:16,950
I have mine too.
I know.

1769
01:22:16,951 --> 01:22:21,951
But have you seen any of those weird uh,
videos of people stripping their fingers

1770
01:22:22,051 --> 01:22:26,370
off on pull up bars and stuff?
I have a friend who had to get an

1771
01:22:26,371 --> 01:22:28,530
operation,
not friend.

1772
01:22:28,610 --> 01:22:28,951
Uh,
dude,

1773
01:22:28,951 --> 01:22:31,450
I know who had to get an operation
because uh,

1774
01:22:31,530 --> 01:22:34,590
while he was doing Jujitsu,
now he knows he's not on the list.

1775
01:22:34,650 --> 01:22:35,421
Well,
I know.

1776
01:22:35,421 --> 01:22:37,080
Um,
but I don't know him.

1777
01:22:37,081 --> 01:22:38,550
I don't have his number.
Okay.

1778
01:22:39,070 --> 01:22:41,730
I don't have your number or your email
and never emailed him.

1779
01:22:41,970 --> 01:22:42,661
Anyway,
his,

1780
01:22:42,661 --> 01:22:46,320
uh,
his wedding ring bent and dug into his

1781
01:22:46,321 --> 01:22:48,720
finger while I was training something
happened.

1782
01:22:48,930 --> 01:22:53,930
Imagine how strong like an arm bar has
the knee or the pressure on your joints,

1783
01:22:54,450 --> 01:22:58,230
whatever the fuck it was.
But it dug into his fingers so deeply

1784
01:22:58,231 --> 01:23:01,410
that he had to get it sorted.
Jitsu been terrain Jujitsu.

1785
01:23:01,590 --> 01:23:03,180
Oh my God.
Oh my God.

1786
01:23:03,190 --> 01:23:05,530
Indeed.
What do you got pictures to Jitsu but

1787
01:23:05,531 --> 01:23:06,650
not happen to Jimmy Fallon,
like

1788
01:23:08,440 --> 01:23:13,440
injury that caused ring ambulation bout
with ring ambulation of finger injury.

1789
01:23:14,051 --> 01:23:16,480
That looks and sounds like something
from a horror movie.

1790
01:23:16,780 --> 01:23:19,150
Okay.
Let's suppose that was his wedding ring

1791
01:23:19,151 --> 01:23:20,200
as well.
Yes.

1792
01:23:20,540 --> 01:23:23,200
Rip The skin off his whole finger.
I think I'm down.

1793
01:23:23,201 --> 01:23:25,720
I'm down for the Tattoo.
I'll get that bone.

1794
01:23:25,810 --> 01:23:30,370
I'll get that queer red wedding a,
you know that tattoo that guys get.

1795
01:23:30,371 --> 01:23:33,160
I've tried to get it,
but they talked us out of it.

1796
01:23:33,190 --> 01:23:38,180
Two different tattoo places said it was
the jinx said if he,

1797
01:23:38,440 --> 01:23:41,320
if you do it,
it's like the curse.

1798
01:23:41,590 --> 01:23:44,860
That's not true.
My friend Big John McCarthy has that

1799
01:23:44,861 --> 01:23:45,970
shit.
He's been married forever.

1800
01:23:45,971 --> 01:23:48,150
Happily married.
It's give a time.

1801
01:23:48,510 --> 01:23:49,510
Nah,
sorry John.

1802
01:23:49,690 --> 01:23:50,620
How long can it last?
I mean,

1803
01:23:50,621 --> 01:23:51,900
he's almost dead.
I'm just kidding.

1804
01:23:52,700 --> 01:23:54,190
I Dang.
That's ruthless.

1805
01:23:54,640 --> 01:23:56,660
He's super nice.
He's the,

1806
01:23:56,900 --> 01:23:58,000
I've met him.
He's the guy.

1807
01:23:58,001 --> 01:23:59,920
He's Super Nice,
but I'm just kidding.

1808
01:23:59,940 --> 01:24:02,910
She brings her archaic.
You know there,

1809
01:24:02,930 --> 01:24:05,140
there's a company that makes a rubber
ring.

1810
01:24:05,260 --> 01:24:06,340
Yeah,
yeah.

1811
01:24:06,520 --> 01:24:08,080
Literally.
That's what I was talking about.

1812
01:24:08,081 --> 01:24:09,130
Yes.
I tried to put that shit on.

1813
01:24:09,131 --> 01:24:12,010
My wife had spit my face.
Here's what's weird.

1814
01:24:12,390 --> 01:24:17,390
My Sharon was going to buy me that four
just because I kept telling her like,

1815
01:24:17,650 --> 01:24:19,840
I'm worried about ripping this finger
off.

1816
01:24:20,080 --> 01:24:22,930
Right.
Mainly because of my wedding ring is

1817
01:24:23,020 --> 01:24:26,620
definitely too small,
so she was looking at some of those,

1818
01:24:26,621 --> 01:24:31,621
a silicone rings and we were literally
looking at it on her ipad in my kitchen.

1819
01:24:34,810 --> 01:24:39,810
I open instagram and started looking.
It's like sponsored ad buy that ring

1820
01:24:42,101 --> 01:24:45,670
company.
Isn't that what's weird?

1821
01:24:46,510 --> 01:24:48,490
It's very weird.
We were just talking about that.

1822
01:24:48,520 --> 01:24:53,080
We're just talking about that the other
day that we stuff you Jamie and whoever

1823
01:24:53,081 --> 01:24:58,081
was on the podcast we were talking about
like having a conversation and if you

1824
01:24:58,271 --> 01:25:03,271
have like Alexa or if you have like
certain things that like listen to you

1825
01:25:03,281 --> 01:25:06,940
while you're talking like maybe even
possibly Siri and then all of a sudden

1826
01:25:06,941 --> 01:25:10,180
you'll go to google and what you were
talking about like slick trick

1827
01:25:10,181 --> 01:25:13,540
broadheads or some shit like that will
show up in your Google ads.

1828
01:25:13,541 --> 01:25:15,370
You're like,
what in the fuck?

1829
01:25:16,330 --> 01:25:21,220
Maybe series series a total fricking.
She is a peeping Tom.

1830
01:25:21,221 --> 01:25:23,180
He's a two face little Ho.
She,

1831
01:25:23,230 --> 01:25:25,660
I don't think she's too faced.
I think Shay Siri,

1832
01:25:25,720 --> 01:25:26,980
she doesn't have a single face.

1833
01:25:28,960 --> 01:25:31,950
You're a two faced bitch.
Oh,

1834
01:25:31,990 --> 01:25:33,850
you're not connected.
Is that a bad thing though?

1835
01:25:33,851 --> 01:25:36,380
I know it.
It's weird and it's that bad.

1836
01:25:36,570 --> 01:25:39,000
I mean at at potentially you could view
that as something like,

1837
01:25:39,040 --> 01:25:42,130
I would probably want to buy that and
now that it's here in an easier way for

1838
01:25:42,131 --> 01:25:43,810
me to do it,
that is kind of,

1839
01:25:43,900 --> 01:25:44,810
I'm just going,
Jamie,

1840
01:25:45,430 --> 01:25:47,290
if you say,
Oh my God,

1841
01:25:47,291 --> 01:25:50,140
I'm gonna die out here.
At that time,

1842
01:25:50,141 --> 01:25:53,440
Siri can step in and say,
would you like me to call a helicopter?

1843
01:25:54,940 --> 01:25:59,050
But when you're looking at rubber rings
for your wedding ring and then it shows

1844
01:25:59,051 --> 01:26:00,550
up on your laptop.
Yeah.

1845
01:26:00,970 --> 01:26:05,180
At that point he's a sell.
Get to the bottom of this.

1846
01:26:05,570 --> 01:26:09,290
Well,
it most certainly exists with Google

1847
01:26:09,650 --> 01:26:11,510
because I've,
I've looked at like,

1848
01:26:11,920 --> 01:26:12,753
what are you?
Cheers.

1849
01:26:13,400 --> 01:26:15,920
I've looked at some,
you're milking it over there.

1850
01:26:15,980 --> 01:26:17,330
I'm all right.
Sadly,

1851
01:26:17,960 --> 01:26:19,220
I smoked pot though.
You didn't.

1852
01:26:19,490 --> 01:26:20,710
Oh,
you did a little sh.

1853
01:26:20,810 --> 01:26:25,280
Don't tell any sponsors.
I might've made that last part up.

1854
01:26:25,700 --> 01:26:28,070
This.
The problem is like you'll be looking at

1855
01:26:28,071 --> 01:26:33,071
something super obscure like a,
like a casio watch sound like casio.

1856
01:26:35,180 --> 01:26:36,013
That's Cassio.

1857
01:26:37,540 --> 01:26:39,070
Yeah.
All right.

1858
01:26:39,440 --> 01:26:40,670
It's,
it has its good one.

1859
01:26:40,671 --> 01:26:42,740
I like this one.
It's like a pro tech and that totally

1860
01:26:42,741 --> 01:26:45,200
doesn't limiter and a an accomplice in
it.

1861
01:26:45,201 --> 01:26:46,310
Totally.
It doesn't look like it.

1862
01:26:46,400 --> 01:26:47,710
It is a casio Lord.
Come on.

1863
01:26:47,711 --> 01:26:49,540
Well,
no shit

1864
01:26:51,350 --> 01:26:54,290
but the eye,
but then all of a sudden it'll show you

1865
01:26:54,440 --> 01:26:56,720
whatever you search for,
whatever it was,

1866
01:26:56,721 --> 01:27:00,230
whether it's surf ports or fucking Hilda
Berg tents.

1867
01:27:00,410 --> 01:27:05,010
There'll be for sale and you'll see like
amazon.com ads for like what?

1868
01:27:05,070 --> 01:27:08,410
Like I was looking at Zeiss by knows the
other day I read.

1869
01:27:08,810 --> 01:27:10,280
Talked about it.
Yes,

1870
01:27:10,370 --> 01:27:11,330
actually,
yeah,

1871
01:27:11,331 --> 01:27:14,720
but then I read a review on them and I
actually googled them,

1872
01:27:14,840 --> 01:27:17,810
but then like everywhere I went,
if I went online,

1873
01:27:17,811 --> 01:27:20,240
I would see a little google ad for Zeiss
by knows.

1874
01:27:20,241 --> 01:27:21,590
I'm like,
this is kind of creepy,

1875
01:27:21,620 --> 01:27:24,320
but that's different.
I think if you google search it,

1876
01:27:24,350 --> 01:27:26,030
you're on the grid.
You are.

1877
01:27:26,660 --> 01:27:30,440
If you're on someone else's device in
your home kitchen,

1878
01:27:31,460 --> 01:27:33,920
it's not like I was looking at it on
mine.

1879
01:27:33,980 --> 01:27:37,550
Right.
I was on Sharon's Ipad then,

1880
01:27:37,670 --> 01:27:41,630
oh,
she was ordering me a ring on her ipad

1881
01:27:41,631 --> 01:27:46,631
and we were talking about it.
Then I opened my instagram up and hears

1882
01:27:46,850 --> 01:27:51,850
the silicone rings as a sponsored
recommendation within my instagram feed.

1883
01:27:57,380 --> 01:27:58,140
Yeah,

1884
01:27:58,140 --> 01:28:01,020
he's backing up.
You gotta back it up,

1885
01:28:01,021 --> 01:28:01,970
back it up.
Oh,

1886
01:28:02,290 --> 01:28:03,720
I want a drink of water.
Go back to that.

1887
01:28:04,050 --> 01:28:07,050
Gmail is free for a reason.
These are all free services we're using

1888
01:28:07,110 --> 01:28:09,630
and not paying for,
so you have to give up a little bit to

1889
01:28:09,631 --> 01:28:12,660
get these cool things to give up your,
I get it.

1890
01:28:12,690 --> 01:28:14,730
Your privilege.
Here's my position.

1891
01:28:16,230 --> 01:28:18,900
My whole,
everything I think of is out there.

1892
01:28:20,870 --> 01:28:23,270
I'm a professional talker.
Every,

1893
01:28:23,300 --> 01:28:27,350
every the most fucked up ideas I've ever
had have all been recorded.

1894
01:28:28,980 --> 01:28:31,190
Very true.
100% true.

1895
01:28:31,520 --> 01:28:35,000
There's no getting around that.
Like I don't have any highly put some

1896
01:28:35,300 --> 01:28:39,350
crazy stuff.
Anybody would anybody I,

1897
01:28:39,351 --> 01:28:41,450
I'm telling you,
there's nothing special about me.

1898
01:28:41,480 --> 01:28:44,120
Anybody would,
if you didn't have a job and you had

1899
01:28:44,121 --> 01:28:47,600
enough free time and you were worried
about paying your bills and we'd have to

1900
01:28:47,620 --> 01:28:52,620
think you are,
you were in tune with the universe.

1901
01:28:57,740 --> 01:28:59,760
Anybody would,
we all would.

1902
01:29:00,310 --> 01:29:02,220
It's nothing special me.
Cheers

1903
01:29:03,900 --> 01:29:05,910
Andy.
Powerful

1904
01:29:08,190 --> 01:29:11,310
about that.
Freak jumping off cliffs flying around

1905
01:29:11,311 --> 01:29:13,830
and posted his video today.
I know you want some of that.

1906
01:29:14,010 --> 01:29:14,880
No.
Good.

1907
01:29:15,000 --> 01:29:17,940
Good for you.
I'm glad you stay away from this.

1908
01:29:18,090 --> 01:29:20,810
This is a bad drug.
Is the God that this is a drug that

1909
01:29:20,811 --> 01:29:22,010
government doesn't approve of.

1910
01:29:23,220 --> 01:29:27,030
California does.
Jeff sessions was in town today.

1911
01:29:27,680 --> 01:29:29,850
Kick grief.
Who's telling people?

1912
01:29:31,050 --> 01:29:36,050
Stop letting Mexicans are watching this.
It's actually five feet away from me,

1913
01:29:36,121 --> 01:29:41,121
but it looked like a fog machine and
Hollywood right there.

1914
01:29:41,880 --> 01:29:43,350
Like some horror movie.
Yeah.

1915
01:29:44,850 --> 01:29:45,950
Do you know,
um,

1916
01:29:46,560 --> 01:29:50,400
remember when I talked,
have you ever listen to my podcast with

1917
01:29:50,460 --> 01:29:52,800
Mike's linkerd with hex?
Yes.

1918
01:29:53,670 --> 01:29:55,380
I've listened to every podcast you've
ever done.

1919
01:29:55,890 --> 01:29:57,720
That's crazy.
Knock on.tv.

1920
01:29:59,330 --> 01:30:00,770
That's not done.
Not Gone.

1921
01:30:00,780 --> 01:30:01,980
Podcast.
Yeah.

1922
01:30:02,040 --> 01:30:03,240
Nope.
Um,

1923
01:30:03,540 --> 01:30:07,380
Mike actually went to Dr. McGee.
Did he?

1924
01:30:07,440 --> 01:30:11,310
Yeah,
he couldn't pull his boat for almost a

1925
01:30:11,310 --> 01:30:15,420
year because he had so many problems in
the shoulder and he was really dreading

1926
01:30:16,050 --> 01:30:20,340
the surgery because he was worried about
his downtime and I told him like,

1927
01:30:20,341 --> 01:30:25,140
man,
you need to to call Rati because there's

1928
01:30:25,141 --> 01:30:29,160
a possibility you don't need the knife.
And so he went down there and he ended

1929
01:30:29,161 --> 01:30:33,780
up getting in an injection I think in
September or October,

1930
01:30:34,410 --> 01:30:39,060
and then he came hunting with me in
November and we actually shot together

1931
01:30:39,061 --> 01:30:41,250
and he goes,
this is the first time I've been able to

1932
01:30:41,251 --> 01:30:43,890
shoot my boat in a long,
long time.

1933
01:30:44,040 --> 01:30:45,600
It's crazy.
Wow,

1934
01:30:47,220 --> 01:30:48,053
that's amazing.

1935
01:30:48,550 --> 01:30:51,340
It's just so cool that there's something
like that out there for people and

1936
01:30:51,341 --> 01:30:52,930
there's a bunch of different versions of
it.

1937
01:30:53,140 --> 01:30:56,170
I know people that have had really good
results where some places they take the

1938
01:30:56,171 --> 01:30:59,590
stem cells out of your fat.
They like to give you a little baby

1939
01:30:59,591 --> 01:31:01,870
liposuction,
pull some fat out,

1940
01:31:01,930 --> 01:31:04,000
take the stem cells,
mix it up,

1941
01:31:04,001 --> 01:31:06,580
shoot it into joints.
People who had real positive results

1942
01:31:06,581 --> 01:31:09,190
with that.
It's weird that we ha we did it the way

1943
01:31:09,191 --> 01:31:12,520
we did it with the blood,
but then there's also the out of the

1944
01:31:12,521 --> 01:31:15,610
bone marrow,
which is supposed to be more painful.

1945
01:31:16,000 --> 01:31:18,490
It's supposed to be more painful,
but it's also supposed to be really

1946
01:31:18,491 --> 01:31:19,440
effective.
Ah,

1947
01:31:19,480 --> 01:31:22,660
Daniel Cormier had that done.
He had real good results with that.

1948
01:31:22,900 --> 01:31:26,000
He had that done with a knee injury and
uh,

1949
01:31:26,170 --> 01:31:29,060
he was concerned like I think I believe
on,

1950
01:31:29,061 --> 01:31:30,100
on to speak out of school.

1951
01:31:30,100 --> 01:31:35,100
I'm pretty sure it was an MCL wasn't um,
the big one.

1952
01:31:35,860 --> 01:31:38,500
It wasn't the acl.
The acl is the big one.

1953
01:31:38,770 --> 01:31:41,260
That's a tough one because that's the
stabilizer one.

1954
01:31:41,261 --> 01:31:43,030
That's the one that goes through the
center of the knee.

1955
01:31:43,210 --> 01:31:45,640
I blown,
blown both of those out heavy.

1956
01:31:45,641 --> 01:31:47,460
Really?
Yeah.

1957
01:31:47,490 --> 01:31:49,030
Even both cut on or,
yeah,

1958
01:31:49,031 --> 01:31:52,000
both of them reconstructed.
Yeah.

1959
01:31:52,001 --> 01:31:56,680
The first one I had done where they take
a chunk of your patella tendon with a

1960
01:31:56,681 --> 01:32:00,460
piece of your knee cap and a piece of
your Shin and they open you up like a

1961
01:32:00,461 --> 01:32:03,400
trout and they fucking screw that baby
in.

1962
01:32:03,490 --> 01:32:06,160
I don't know if I've ever seen the front
of your knee cap.

1963
01:32:06,220 --> 01:32:07,090
Yeah,
you can see it.

1964
01:32:07,091 --> 01:32:08,890
There's like,
that's a big cut.

1965
01:32:08,891 --> 01:32:13,891
Normally get those barbell jeans up.
These are by the Belgians minor to also

1966
01:32:14,921 --> 01:32:17,200
not a sponsor.
You can kind of see they're awesome

1967
01:32:17,201 --> 01:32:18,034
guys.

1968
01:32:18,280 --> 01:32:19,600
Well,
it's a great product.

1969
01:32:19,870 --> 01:32:23,590
There's calf out there that I'm not
flexing and that's just what my calf,

1970
01:32:23,591 --> 01:32:25,030
I am,
I'm not,

1971
01:32:25,300 --> 01:32:27,310
I am,
I have large your flex.

1972
01:32:27,510 --> 01:32:29,400
I'm not,
I'm the rock.

1973
01:32:29,410 --> 01:32:30,250
I'm not at all.
Look,

1974
01:32:30,400 --> 01:32:31,760
look,
see,

1975
01:32:32,110 --> 01:32:34,070
I'm losing.
I'm very loose.

1976
01:32:34,110 --> 01:32:35,090
Flicks him.
Um,

1977
01:32:35,130 --> 01:32:37,510
so I wanna look cool.
This is great now,

1978
01:32:37,511 --> 01:32:39,580
but it was,
it was in pain for a year.

1979
01:32:39,790 --> 01:32:42,920
A solid year.
Like I couldn't kneel net,

1980
01:32:42,921 --> 01:32:44,560
no kneeling.
There was no kneeling going on.

1981
01:32:44,890 --> 01:32:47,020
If I had to suck Dick,
I'd be in real trouble.

1982
01:32:47,260 --> 01:32:49,630
I have to lie on the bed.
Let it do not my face.

1983
01:32:49,990 --> 01:32:54,370
There was no way I'd be able to say
that's the alcohol talking.

1984
01:32:55,630 --> 01:32:57,280
The point is,
it was painful.

1985
01:32:57,580 --> 01:33:01,960
But the other one that I had done a,
I had it done with a another planet.

1986
01:33:02,410 --> 01:33:04,930
I had it done with a cadaver and that
way,

1987
01:33:05,080 --> 01:33:05,620
way easier.

1988
01:33:05,620 --> 01:33:07,060
Yeah.
That was ways you're in,

1989
01:33:07,061 --> 01:33:09,370
but way weirder because you're thinking
about it.

1990
01:33:09,371 --> 01:33:11,980
You get some dead person's parts in your
body.

1991
01:33:12,550 --> 01:33:13,960
My father,
well,

1992
01:33:14,200 --> 01:33:19,200
I shouldn't say that.
Sharon stepdad has a pig heart and he's

1993
01:33:19,870 --> 01:33:21,760
pretty proud of it.
Wow.

1994
01:33:21,761 --> 01:33:26,761
He has a pig heart grew it in a pig.
What you mean it's a pig heart like it's

1995
01:33:27,311 --> 01:33:28,210
his,
no,

1996
01:33:28,211 --> 01:33:30,810
they used a pig valve in his heart.
Okay.

1997
01:33:31,000 --> 01:33:33,430
They can't do that with a whole heart.
I don't think so.

1998
01:33:33,640 --> 01:33:34,930
But they can do with parts.
Right.

1999
01:33:34,931 --> 01:33:39,550
Pigs are super similar apparently to
people with certain organs to the point

2000
01:33:39,551 --> 01:33:42,220
where they think that there might be a
time where we,

2001
01:33:42,280 --> 01:33:45,220
uh,
use genetic engineering to manipulate a

2002
01:33:45,221 --> 01:33:49,060
pig to grow a human body.
Parts what?

2003
01:33:49,510 --> 01:33:50,440
Yeah,
they're real,

2004
01:33:50,470 --> 01:33:55,470
they're real close apparently to
figuring out a way to combine human.

2005
01:33:56,880 --> 01:34:01,660
They're scientists grow bullish on paid
to human transplants.

2006
01:34:02,050 --> 01:34:03,960
Jamie just pulled up an article.
It's Baltimore.

2007
01:34:04,310 --> 01:34:07,840
It's the website
science mag.org.

2008
01:34:08,320 --> 01:34:10,750
And uh,
this is something that they've apparent.

2009
01:34:10,780 --> 01:34:14,680
There's apparently enough similarity.
This is coming from a dummy,

2010
01:34:14,710 --> 01:34:18,130
by the way,
settle down enough similarity between

2011
01:34:18,131 --> 01:34:20,980
pigs and humans that we might be able to
grow their organs,

2012
01:34:21,820 --> 01:34:26,210
grow our organs rather inside of them.
And so like if you need to,

2013
01:34:26,350 --> 01:34:31,020
if he needed a new liver or a kidney or
if you needed maybe even a heart,

2014
01:34:31,270 --> 01:34:36,270
something they could possibly grow it
inside of this genetically altered pig

2015
01:34:38,410 --> 01:34:39,790
cause they're really close to us.

2016
01:34:42,420 --> 01:34:43,600
It's Freaky Shit,
man.

2017
01:34:43,660 --> 01:34:46,510
It's definitely freaky.
It's freaky shit because,

2018
01:34:47,100 --> 01:34:49,780
uh,
one of the things that I've gotten more

2019
01:34:49,781 --> 01:34:52,420
and more adamant about from,
um,

2020
01:34:52,450 --> 01:34:55,940
being around wild animals,
um,

2021
01:34:55,960 --> 01:34:59,240
is that that's really the only way
animals should be.

2022
01:34:59,630 --> 01:35:01,760
I mean,
there's one thing like your dog like

2023
01:35:01,761 --> 01:35:02,910
shades.
Yup.

2024
01:35:03,020 --> 01:35:05,600
I don't want the shades to be wild.
She's a sweetie.

2025
01:35:05,660 --> 01:35:07,400
Right.
You know what I mean?

2026
01:35:07,580 --> 01:35:09,470
She wouldn't make it.
That's a different thing.

2027
01:35:09,500 --> 01:35:13,160
She wouldn't make it different thing.
Pat is a different thing and anybody

2028
01:35:13,161 --> 01:35:15,110
thinks to start a different,
that's a family member.

2029
01:35:15,610 --> 01:35:17,630
Uh,
my pets are family members,

2030
01:35:17,660 --> 01:35:18,670
my dog,
my,

2031
01:35:19,280 --> 01:35:20,500
you know,
if,

2032
01:35:21,000 --> 01:35:24,350
if I have an interaction with a dog,
it's like I love them.

2033
01:35:24,880 --> 01:35:26,990
And this is not the same as,
um,

2034
01:35:27,530 --> 01:35:32,530
the way I feel about
a wild thing.

2035
01:35:33,200 --> 01:35:35,270
Wild thing.
I want to be wild.

2036
01:35:36,120 --> 01:35:40,130
Really want them to be wild because I
just think that we fucked up.

2037
01:35:40,550 --> 01:35:45,550
We got real comfortable with this way of
a raising and treating life outside of

2038
01:35:49,191 --> 01:35:51,500
our own species.
Even her own,

2039
01:35:52,070 --> 01:35:53,390
she would argue.
Sure.

2040
01:35:53,570 --> 01:35:54,650
Right,
and you'd be right.

2041
01:35:55,660 --> 01:35:57,710
You've been around.
Even her own has been,

2042
01:35:57,800 --> 01:36:02,090
I think the whole,
I think the whole picture is completely

2043
01:36:02,091 --> 01:36:04,100
different now.
People won't get it.

2044
01:36:04,730 --> 01:36:09,730
I mean we want our,
our pet dog to be part of our family,

2045
01:36:11,030 --> 01:36:15,110
but the reality is if they were
legitimately out there in the wild,

2046
01:36:15,111 --> 01:36:20,111
they would be dead quick.
My kids got rabbits,

2047
01:36:20,510 --> 01:36:22,820
they're useless.
They don't give a fuck about these

2048
01:36:22,821 --> 01:36:26,840
rabbits,
which we talked about this in favor like

2049
01:36:26,841 --> 01:36:29,090
we have to give rabbits,
but okay,

2050
01:36:29,240 --> 01:36:30,890
okay,
we'll get rabbits.

2051
01:36:30,891 --> 01:36:32,660
They don't give a fuck about those
rabbits.

2052
01:36:32,661 --> 01:36:35,180
They go like a week without even looking
at those things.

2053
01:36:35,510 --> 01:36:38,630
They just don't care.
And the rabbit stay chill with the

2054
01:36:38,631 --> 01:36:39,800
chickens in the chicken coop.

2055
01:36:39,830 --> 01:36:42,170
So everybody's good rabbit's,
you're having a good old time.

2056
01:36:42,270 --> 01:36:44,960
They're selfish too.
Here's the thing,

2057
01:36:45,320 --> 01:36:49,850
what rabbit is,
is a small prey animal that has to

2058
01:36:49,851 --> 01:36:52,430
dapped its environment.
So if its environment,

2059
01:36:52,431 --> 01:36:55,610
it's just them being outside by
themselves all the time.

2060
01:36:55,760 --> 01:36:57,860
Well,
as you expected them to be domesticated,

2061
01:36:58,040 --> 01:37:00,950
they're basically wild in the cage.
You know,

2062
01:37:01,040 --> 01:37:03,530
they're not constantly getting direct
contact with people,

2063
01:37:03,560 --> 01:37:06,530
but don't you think some people could be
argued the same?

2064
01:37:06,830 --> 01:37:08,480
You have for sure,
but a button.

2065
01:37:08,481 --> 01:37:11,300
But he was the one,
I haven't let you see this yet.

2066
01:37:11,800 --> 01:37:15,350
I'll let you finish your point.
This is just such a difference between

2067
01:37:15,351 --> 01:37:19,250
them and a dog.
Like the idea of that a rabbit interacts

2068
01:37:19,251 --> 01:37:21,950
with you with the way it fucking dog
does is bananas.

2069
01:37:22,160 --> 01:37:25,580
You're losing me if you don't tell me
you like dogs more than you like

2070
01:37:25,581 --> 01:37:28,940
rabbits.
I can't talk to you because I've got

2071
01:37:28,941 --> 01:37:31,130
dogs that are like little people.
All right.

2072
01:37:31,190 --> 01:37:33,380
I mean they're,
they're like when my friends like

2073
01:37:33,381 --> 01:37:34,550
Marshall's,
my friend,

2074
01:37:35,030 --> 01:37:38,300
he's a one year old friend that I have.
I have one friend who's one years old.

2075
01:37:38,930 --> 01:37:43,590
This dude and he's literally your best
friend and he,

2076
01:37:43,760 --> 01:37:48,470
there's like,
do nothing separating you from his best

2077
01:37:48,471 --> 01:37:49,450
friend.
No,

2078
01:37:49,451 --> 01:37:50,990
we're,
we're super tight.

2079
01:37:51,050 --> 01:37:53,180
We're like this.
As long as he doesn't steal food off the

2080
01:37:53,181 --> 01:37:54,980
table,
which she will if I'm not looking.

2081
01:37:55,080 --> 01:37:56,100
That's your side

2082
01:37:56,100 --> 01:38:00,390
to his side.
He's 100% dedicated unit.

2083
01:38:00,480 --> 01:38:04,470
Even if you stoled food from his side,
he would still be your best friend the

2084
01:38:04,470 --> 01:38:06,800
next day.
100% he's just gotta know the rules can

2085
01:38:06,810 --> 01:38:10,440
be stealing food,
can be climbing on the table and he

2086
01:38:10,441 --> 01:38:13,920
fucking savage like dogs would just jump
on the table and just,

2087
01:38:14,090 --> 01:38:17,190
you don't realize how like,
oh that's a course.

2088
01:38:17,191 --> 01:38:19,050
That's is the food is,
why would he jump up there?

2089
01:38:19,051 --> 01:38:22,230
It's amazing you've been able to stop
him from jumping up there.

2090
01:38:22,231 --> 01:38:24,810
The moment he gets in the room.
That's what's really amazing.

2091
01:38:24,840 --> 01:38:28,500
Here's what's crazy though.
If people had to really go out in the

2092
01:38:28,501 --> 01:38:33,480
world and defend them,
fen defend themselves like our dogs

2093
01:38:33,481 --> 01:38:36,000
would that are technically family
members,

2094
01:38:37,500 --> 01:38:40,620
there would be a very clear line drawn.
Yes,

2095
01:38:40,621 --> 01:38:42,600
but they don't and that's why we're
delusional.

2096
01:38:42,601 --> 01:38:45,840
And then there's movies,
Disney movies,

2097
01:38:45,841 --> 01:38:47,910
Bambi,
all that crazy shit.

2098
01:38:47,910 --> 01:38:51,120
Yogi and booboo.
But Molly's that rabbit movie.

2099
01:38:51,350 --> 01:38:53,790
Cause when we got on this subject,
most recent one?

2100
01:38:53,791 --> 01:38:56,730
No.
Sharon brought up that movie that was

2101
01:38:56,731 --> 01:38:59,910
like the darkest kids movie.
Does it ted?

2102
01:39:00,210 --> 01:39:01,043
No,
it was,

2103
01:39:01,080 --> 01:39:03,660
it was a rabbit movie.
Rabbit movie.

2104
01:39:04,290 --> 01:39:05,880
What was the name of it?
Look it up,

2105
01:39:05,881 --> 01:39:07,290
Jamie.
It was like,

2106
01:39:07,470 --> 01:39:10,080
it was considered one of the,
I don't know,

2107
01:39:10,081 --> 01:39:14,070
one of the darkest kids movies.
It was where it was all about rabbits

2108
01:39:14,100 --> 01:39:15,680
and I'm trying to think of the name of
it.

2109
01:39:15,681 --> 01:39:17,430
It was,
I don't even know what that is.

2110
01:39:18,730 --> 01:39:21,750
I,
there was a youtube video showing pretty

2111
01:39:21,751 --> 01:39:24,480
much,
it was like a highlight reel of that

2112
01:39:24,481 --> 01:39:29,250
movie and it was too,
I think a mirror inland Manson song and

2113
01:39:29,251 --> 01:39:32,610
it was crazy.
It was pretty dark.

2114
01:39:32,640 --> 01:39:36,720
I think it was called bright eyes or
maybe that was the theme song to the

2115
01:39:36,721 --> 01:39:37,554
movie.

2116
01:39:38,190 --> 01:39:40,530
Bright Eyes.
A dark rabbit.

2117
01:39:40,531 --> 01:39:41,620
Mophie dumb,
dumb,

2118
01:39:41,660 --> 01:39:43,980
dumb.
Seriously.

2119
01:39:44,040 --> 01:39:47,550
You need to look that up on Youtube.
Little by a right eyes.

2120
01:39:47,730 --> 01:39:50,520
Imagine fuck bigfoot Matt.
Just seven foot rabbit.

2121
01:39:50,760 --> 01:39:52,980
I tries to bite your head off with those
giant teeth.

2122
01:39:53,310 --> 01:39:55,170
I don't know,
seven foot rabbit.

2123
01:39:55,290 --> 01:39:57,750
I don't know if I'd be that terrified,
terrified.

2124
01:39:57,751 --> 01:40:00,810
Seven foot Grizzly,
I'd be way more terrifying.

2125
01:40:00,811 --> 01:40:03,660
Sure.
Seven foot crocodile way more terrified.

2126
01:40:03,670 --> 01:40:05,350
Okay.
Komodo Dragon.

2127
01:40:05,351 --> 01:40:08,340
Did you find it?
What does leadership down?

2128
01:40:08,341 --> 01:40:10,260
Maybe that's it.
That's it.

2129
01:40:11,220 --> 01:40:15,330
Pressing rabbit moving it is to die.
Remember this,

2130
01:40:16,020 --> 01:40:18,190
he needed to watch this.
Wow.

2131
01:40:18,270 --> 01:40:20,760
Watershed Cam trailer.
If we play it,

2132
01:40:20,761 --> 01:40:24,030
we'll get yanked off of youtube.
But can you play that?

2133
01:40:24,031 --> 01:40:27,000
Uh,
we can't play any clips today.

2134
01:40:27,001 --> 01:40:28,710
It's crazy today.
What's going on?

2135
01:40:28,711 --> 01:40:29,760
Well,
after the hold up,

2136
01:40:30,380 --> 01:40:31,460
it's not,
go ahead and take a,

2137
01:40:31,710 --> 01:40:33,840
take a leak.
Hey Jamie,

2138
01:40:34,500 --> 01:40:39,000
that while we're talking about
alligators or crocodiles,

2139
01:40:39,001 --> 01:40:41,010
you gotta see this?
This is actually,

2140
01:40:41,011 --> 01:40:44,430
um,
one of the guys that dragons,

2141
01:40:44,431 --> 01:40:47,190
yeah.
This is a new short film coming up.

2142
01:40:47,220 --> 01:40:52,220
This is one of the guys that is,
he documents wildlife,

2143
01:40:53,740 --> 01:40:54,573
um,

2144
01:40:54,780 --> 01:40:58,420
that mouth and he's,
he's a hex advocate,

2145
01:40:58,421 --> 01:41:01,630
but he wasn't a hex advocate first.
He was a,

2146
01:41:01,960 --> 01:41:04,390
well,
let's explain what hexis you can explain

2147
01:41:04,391 --> 01:41:08,320
it.
A hecs rather is a,

2148
01:41:08,770 --> 01:41:13,770
it's a company that makes um,
these suits that apparently the idea is

2149
01:41:14,141 --> 01:41:19,141
that they block and electro magnetic
frequency that people admit is that I

2150
01:41:20,110 --> 01:41:20,831
saying,
yeah,

2151
01:41:20,831 --> 01:41:25,831
you're good and electromagnetic current.
There's something body emits that they

2152
01:41:27,461 --> 01:41:30,790
think John Dudley has left the room.
He has to pee.

2153
01:41:31,840 --> 01:41:34,180
I don't know.
This is the,

2154
01:41:34,510 --> 01:41:37,450
the most honest way I can say this.
Um,

2155
01:41:37,720 --> 01:41:42,720
John is a big believer in this heck
system and I don't know if it works but

2156
01:41:44,891 --> 01:41:49,780
I know a lot of people think it works
and there is a task that they use where

2157
01:41:49,781 --> 01:41:52,240
there's a machine,
see if he could find,

2158
01:41:52,270 --> 01:41:54,970
they have a video of him explaining how
it works.

2159
01:41:55,090 --> 01:41:57,080
And in the video it says it in there.

2160
01:41:57,080 --> 01:41:59,020
There's a,
on the website there's a video link.

2161
01:41:59,080 --> 01:42:01,570
See the video link?
Yeah.

2162
01:42:02,140 --> 01:42:04,000
Um,
see where it says videos.

2163
01:42:04,060 --> 01:42:04,960
Uh,
third from the,

2164
01:42:04,961 --> 01:42:06,200
yeah,
there is um,

2165
01:42:06,250 --> 01:42:11,250
there's something where they show the,
they can swipe their arm over some sort

2166
01:42:11,411 --> 01:42:16,411
of a machine that is designed to detect
electrical current that comes from your

2167
01:42:17,651 --> 01:42:20,830
body.
And they do it with just a normal arm

2168
01:42:20,831 --> 01:42:24,910
with like a shirt on and then they do it
with this heck suit on and the heck suit

2169
01:42:25,360 --> 01:42:30,360
it blocks whatever that frequency is.
And so the idea is that we're assuming

2170
01:42:30,611 --> 01:42:35,611
that somehow or another the animals
might have some sort of method of

2171
01:42:36,431 --> 01:42:39,880
detection by way of the actual
electrical energy that's come from a

2172
01:42:39,881 --> 01:42:42,190
person.
Do I know if that's correct?

2173
01:42:42,191 --> 01:42:44,530
I do not.
I do not know if that's correct.

2174
01:42:44,770 --> 01:42:49,630
It's fascinating to think of though,
because I wonder how many different

2175
01:42:49,631 --> 01:42:54,631
animals have this interesting sort of
ability to detect things other than just

2176
01:42:56,951 --> 01:42:58,210
smelling and seeing.

2177
01:42:58,420 --> 01:43:03,010
Like maybe there's a feel,
maybe they have a feel and apparently

2178
01:43:03,011 --> 01:43:06,490
these things are particularly effective
with predators,

2179
01:43:07,510 --> 01:43:10,420
which kind of makes sense.
I guess that predators would,

2180
01:43:10,421 --> 01:43:15,421
it would feel the electrical frequency
that's coming from a UN nervous scared

2181
01:43:17,051 --> 01:43:19,300
animal or something he's trying to run
from it.

2182
01:43:19,810 --> 01:43:22,240
And um,
these things are really effective

2183
01:43:22,241 --> 01:43:26,200
apparently with coyotes.
And this is this documentary or this

2184
01:43:26,201 --> 01:43:27,610
little short film rather,
uh,

2185
01:43:27,730 --> 01:43:29,830
dances,
dancing with dragons.

2186
01:43:30,490 --> 01:43:32,860
Perfect timing.
I just explained hacks to a t.

2187
01:43:33,940 --> 01:43:37,150
I'm a wizard without knowing shit,
barely got through high school.

2188
01:43:37,450 --> 01:43:38,400
This is,
um,

2189
01:43:38,980 --> 01:43:41,710
so apparently this signal,
whatever the,

2190
01:43:41,711 --> 01:43:44,980
the human signal is,
I mean that the fact that they can

2191
01:43:44,981 --> 01:43:48,490
detect it in this machine and I've
watched that detection,

2192
01:43:48,491 --> 01:43:49,720
it's real.
It's legitimate.

2193
01:43:49,721 --> 01:43:52,370
So something's happening that the
machine detects.

2194
01:43:52,610 --> 01:43:57,560
I think we'd be foolhardy to believe
that animals can't detect that as well.

2195
01:43:57,680 --> 01:44:00,110
Now is that mean that it will work on
everything and no,

2196
01:44:00,111 --> 01:44:01,610
believer,
I'm a believer too,

2197
01:44:01,730 --> 01:44:03,080
but this is what I think.
I think it's,

2198
01:44:03,350 --> 01:44:05,570
there's a whole,
there's so many factors when it comes to

2199
01:44:05,571 --> 01:44:08,030
getting close to an animal.
I think they have so many senses.

2200
01:44:08,210 --> 01:44:12,050
I think they could smell in some insane
way that we can't even imagine.

2201
01:44:12,140 --> 01:44:14,090
They can hear shit.
We can never here.

2202
01:44:14,630 --> 01:44:17,450
They're just tuned in the idea that that
would be it.

2203
01:44:17,620 --> 01:44:20,210
That they wouldn't have some other shit
that we haven't really thought of.

2204
01:44:20,550 --> 01:44:24,020
This would be a good guest for you.
[inaudible] name is forrest Scullin.

2205
01:44:24,030 --> 01:44:25,800
Tay is actually,
um,

2206
01:44:25,890 --> 01:44:30,690
he's got some really cool stuff coming
up that I'm not able to talk about,

2207
01:44:30,720 --> 01:44:34,020
but I,
I know you and now tell me the things

2208
01:44:34,021 --> 01:44:36,810
over.
I know you enough to know that it's in

2209
01:44:36,811 --> 01:44:38,760
your wheelhouse,
but,

2210
01:44:38,761 --> 01:44:42,750
uh,
this is all a hundred percent wild,

2211
01:44:42,900 --> 01:44:45,150
I think,
I don't want to say it wrong,

2212
01:44:45,151 --> 01:44:49,150
but I think it's at a certain place down
south of Mexico.

2213
01:44:49,151 --> 01:44:50,200
This,
yeah.

2214
01:44:50,310 --> 01:44:51,540
Yeah,
absolutely.

2215
01:44:51,900 --> 01:44:52,733
So this,
um,

2216
01:44:52,800 --> 01:44:56,010
he had,
he just had a documentary that came out.

2217
01:44:56,100 --> 01:45:00,540
He's in a document,
he's in a heck suit that actually has a

2218
01:45:00,541 --> 01:45:03,900
pattern that resembles the saltwater
crocodiles.

2219
01:45:04,260 --> 01:45:06,120
Wow.
Did you notice that part?

2220
01:45:06,150 --> 01:45:09,030
I did not want,
but I only did once you brought it up,

2221
01:45:09,540 --> 01:45:14,160
I was mimicking,
he's mimicking the behaviors of a

2222
01:45:14,161 --> 01:45:19,161
saltwater croc so that he can literally
be within a few inches of them.

2223
01:45:21,520 --> 01:45:26,140
So did they wa they would probably be
real dangerous to try that even the way

2224
01:45:26,141 --> 01:45:28,450
he did it.
But did they try it without the heck

2225
01:45:28,451 --> 01:45:29,890
suit?
Like did they try like a,

2226
01:45:29,960 --> 01:45:32,100
like a rash guard that with the same
exact

2227
01:45:32,160 --> 01:45:33,900
pattern on it?
Yeah.

2228
01:45:34,350 --> 01:45:35,183
Yeah.
There's,

2229
01:45:35,220 --> 01:45:37,800
there's,
there's a lot of really good videos

2230
01:45:37,801 --> 01:45:42,030
showing the difference between how much
interaction you can have with certain

2231
01:45:42,031 --> 01:45:44,070
animals that,
especially ones that have,

2232
01:45:44,180 --> 01:45:48,570
it's scientifically been proven to test
to sense it.

2233
01:45:48,650 --> 01:45:51,570
Yeah.
So you know,

2234
01:45:51,571 --> 01:45:56,220
in the wildlife community things like
sharks and shark week obviously have a

2235
01:45:56,221 --> 01:46:00,210
huge amount of funding behind it.
A migratory birds,

2236
01:46:00,240 --> 01:46:02,070
same thing.
So all that stuff.

2237
01:46:02,071 --> 01:46:06,600
There's been very good documentation on,
you know,

2238
01:46:06,750 --> 01:46:10,260
electromagnetic fields and what animals
can see.

2239
01:46:10,290 --> 01:46:12,570
But when it comes to like the hunting
community,

2240
01:46:12,630 --> 01:46:16,530
obviously there's not a lot of big
funding behind it because it's a much

2241
01:46:16,531 --> 01:46:20,040
smaller community.
But things like this,

2242
01:46:20,041 --> 01:46:23,670
things that are on animal planet or
Discovery Channel,

2243
01:46:23,940 --> 01:46:28,940
I mean these are things that are at I
think a higher level of maybe testing

2244
01:46:30,570 --> 01:46:35,570
versus what we have in the hunting side.
And I just know that me personally as a

2245
01:46:35,611 --> 01:46:38,970
hunter,
I've experienced more like up close

2246
01:46:39,030 --> 01:46:42,810
interaction with it.
So I just find some of this stuff

2247
01:46:42,811 --> 01:46:44,100
really,
really cool,

2248
01:46:44,101 --> 01:46:44,160
all

2249
01:46:44,160 --> 01:46:46,930
that,
that's like a placebo effect that you

2250
01:46:46,960 --> 01:46:49,140
may be just,
we're in a really good spot with really

2251
01:46:49,141 --> 01:46:51,120
good wind.
And you had a few experiences,

2252
01:46:51,121 --> 01:46:53,130
so you put it together and he said,
this is what's happening.

2253
01:46:53,580 --> 01:46:54,350
Is it possible?

2254
01:46:54,350 --> 01:46:57,470
It's possible,
but in the same sense,

2255
01:46:57,770 --> 01:47:00,680
I'll leave that up to you.
I think it's possible too,

2256
01:47:00,770 --> 01:47:01,790
but I just want,
I brought it up

2257
01:47:01,810 --> 01:47:03,600
because I think,
I think it's possible,

2258
01:47:03,601 --> 01:47:05,520
but I think people want one or the
other.

2259
01:47:05,550 --> 01:47:08,190
Right.
And I think it's also entirely possible

2260
01:47:08,220 --> 01:47:12,300
if there's a machine that can detect
your electrical magnetic frequency or

2261
01:47:12,301 --> 01:47:14,720
whatever the fuck that is.
When they do it over that machine to

2262
01:47:14,730 --> 01:47:16,660
there is there is and I've seen it.
Yeah.

2263
01:47:16,710 --> 01:47:18,750
Okay.
So what's happening there and why are we

2264
01:47:18,751 --> 01:47:22,170
assuming animals can't see that?
Definitely didn't see at night.

2265
01:47:22,200 --> 01:47:23,940
They could see at night.
Right?

2266
01:47:23,941 --> 01:47:25,740
They do things that we can't do.
They smell things.

2267
01:47:25,741 --> 01:47:27,330
We can't smell the hear things we can't
hear.

2268
01:47:27,570 --> 01:47:30,570
We have intuition.
Why would we assume that their intuition

2269
01:47:30,571 --> 01:47:32,850
is not thousands of times sharper than
ours?

2270
01:47:33,090 --> 01:47:35,040
They're running away from fucking
crocodiles and shit.

2271
01:47:35,110 --> 01:47:36,490
Do you know that?
Um,

2272
01:47:36,520 --> 01:47:39,580
I know when you did the podcast with
James Hetfield,

2273
01:47:39,581 --> 01:47:44,080
you guys talked about bees a lot.
Do you know that bees when they go to

2274
01:47:44,081 --> 01:47:49,081
and from certain flowers that actually
they leave in an electromagnetic

2275
01:47:51,520 --> 01:47:56,520
signal on that part so that actually
other bees can see that and know that

2276
01:47:58,601 --> 01:48:02,170
something is another b had already been
there to pollinate that area.

2277
01:48:02,200 --> 01:48:05,620
Oh,
I've got a video I can show you that

2278
01:48:05,650 --> 01:48:07,570
actually shows that.
But um,

2279
01:48:07,780 --> 01:48:10,750
did I ever tell you about my experience
with bees on fear factor?

2280
01:48:11,560 --> 01:48:14,110
Yeah.
Super Cool.

2281
01:48:14,200 --> 01:48:14,720
Yeah.

2282
01:48:14,720 --> 01:48:17,060
They got together,
this was a crazy moment.

2283
01:48:17,061 --> 01:48:20,000
They had trained be communication
contests.

2284
01:48:20,420 --> 01:48:24,440
These bees of this guy had brought in
who's a beekeeper and then while we were

2285
01:48:24,441 --> 01:48:27,200
doing the stunt on these people and they
put the bees on these people,

2286
01:48:27,410 --> 01:48:32,410
all of a sudden this local beehive
emptied out and came to visit and they

2287
01:48:32,421 --> 01:48:34,040
all,
all the bees got together in the middle

2288
01:48:34,041 --> 01:48:37,370
of the sky and talked and we had a sit
down for like a half an hour.

2289
01:48:37,670 --> 01:48:38,750
The guy was like,
you know,

2290
01:48:38,751 --> 01:48:40,420
we're not gonna do anything.
We're going to do that.

2291
01:48:40,430 --> 01:48:42,770
We have to step back and let them work
this out.

2292
01:48:43,130 --> 01:48:48,130
So he just knew.
He knew how like these alien beings

2293
01:48:48,171 --> 01:48:49,460
we're going to communicate with each
other,

2294
01:48:49,700 --> 01:48:51,440
how they're figuring out their life
forms,

2295
01:48:51,441 --> 01:48:52,640
man.
And we're just like,

2296
01:48:52,641 --> 01:48:53,990
oh it's just bs.
No it's on,

2297
01:48:54,020 --> 01:48:59,020
it's a little weird life form that can
fly that somehow under the figures out

2298
01:48:59,300 --> 01:49:02,270
they exchange information with these
other weird life forms.

2299
01:49:02,390 --> 01:49:03,680
They realize,
hey we don't,

2300
01:49:03,710 --> 01:49:05,690
we didn't ask to be here.
We're not trying to take over your

2301
01:49:05,691 --> 01:49:06,800
community.
We just,

2302
01:49:06,830 --> 01:49:08,630
we showed up cause we're doing fear
factor.

2303
01:49:08,890 --> 01:49:12,220
He know the wiggle dance.
The little thing that bees do,

2304
01:49:12,520 --> 01:49:14,080
the wiggle dance,
what is that?

2305
01:49:14,110 --> 01:49:19,110
They say that's,
they assume that's that that's actually

2306
01:49:19,271 --> 01:49:24,271
an electromagnetic dance that's done to
where it gives a signal to the other

2307
01:49:25,451 --> 01:49:29,080
bees to where they can actually know
what they're communicating so they can

2308
01:49:29,081 --> 01:49:30,400
say things.
Yep.

2309
01:49:31,210 --> 01:49:33,760
Did they know like how complicated the
speech can be?

2310
01:49:34,800 --> 01:49:36,370
Well,
I mean,

2311
01:49:36,430 --> 01:49:41,430
obviously if a bee is sitting in a hive
in my Bush out in my front yard and he

2312
01:49:43,001 --> 01:49:48,001
knows to go three blocks down and two
blocks over and get into

2313
01:49:48,190 --> 01:49:51,010
those purple flowers that are in
someone's front yard,

2314
01:49:51,011 --> 01:49:55,290
they must know pretty dang good
too.

2315
01:49:55,330 --> 01:49:57,100
They know.
I mean,

2316
01:49:57,101 --> 01:49:58,250
we just,
we just left.

2317
01:49:58,251 --> 01:50:00,730
They had a heck suit on.
They probably wouldn't be able to figure

2318
01:50:00,731 --> 01:50:02,170
it out,
be screwed.

2319
01:50:02,530 --> 01:50:04,120
That's an interesting idea,
man.

2320
01:50:04,121 --> 01:50:06,280
That there is really some sort of
electrical fee.

2321
01:50:06,320 --> 01:50:08,830
Whoa.
Electrical fields of flowers.

2322
01:50:08,831 --> 01:50:12,340
Jane simulate the sensory hairs of
bumblebees.

2323
01:50:12,490 --> 01:50:14,040
Holy Shit,
dude.

2324
01:50:15,100 --> 01:50:18,430
Heck seen on a bumblebee.
And he's like,

2325
01:50:18,431 --> 01:50:22,750
nothing's getting pollinated.
Listened what that says electrical

2326
01:50:22,751 --> 01:50:27,751
fields of flowers stimulate the sensory
hairs of Bumblebee.

2327
01:50:28,341 --> 01:50:32,620
So their hairs are feeling where the
wind is pulling them.

2328
01:50:32,650 --> 01:50:34,540
They're,
they're feeling some sort of electrical

2329
01:50:34,541 --> 01:50:37,100
charge to a certain little,
little green,

2330
01:50:37,110 --> 01:50:41,140
the dance solid fuck man,
that is,

2331
01:50:41,290 --> 01:50:43,990
we're just,
because they can't send emails,

2332
01:50:44,410 --> 01:50:45,750
they don't do anything.
That's really,

2333
01:50:45,790 --> 01:50:49,540
we weave so slept on bays.
They're dying off like they're crazy

2334
01:50:49,541 --> 01:50:51,130
because they're super cool.

2335
01:50:51,670 --> 01:50:54,040
These are super,
they're super cool.

2336
01:50:54,070 --> 01:50:54,970
Yup.
Yeah.

2337
01:50:55,510 --> 01:50:58,330
Yup.
People that don't give a fuck about bees

2338
01:50:58,331 --> 01:51:02,800
like those are like the most hardcore,
the most hardcore radical Republican

2339
01:51:02,801 --> 01:51:03,520
guys.
All right,

2340
01:51:03,520 --> 01:51:05,980
we'll figure out mechanical piece.
Don't worry about it.

2341
01:51:06,910 --> 01:51:09,360
There was a black mirror,
just people that are like that.

2342
01:51:09,370 --> 01:51:11,860
Man.
That was a good show dude.

2343
01:51:12,060 --> 01:51:14,740
He started sharing and I started
watching it because of you.

2344
01:51:15,010 --> 01:51:17,380
Did you watch the dog one with the robot
dogs?

2345
01:51:17,410 --> 01:51:18,330
Yeah,
we watched them.

2346
01:51:19,890 --> 01:51:22,060
It was a fucking terrifying show,
right?

2347
01:51:22,710 --> 01:51:23,560
Cause you're like,
oh,

2348
01:51:23,561 --> 01:51:24,610
this is all like,
well,

2349
01:51:24,611 --> 01:51:27,010
within the realm of possibility,
all of it.

2350
01:51:27,190 --> 01:51:30,490
It's almost like a warning show.
It's like gay Fuckos.

2351
01:51:30,790 --> 01:51:35,280
This is what could go wrong.
Every episode of that.

2352
01:51:36,790 --> 01:51:38,870
Did you see the one with The v?
I don't want to give any spoilers or

2353
01:51:38,880 --> 01:51:41,770
words with the video game that they put
a chip in your brain.

2354
01:51:41,840 --> 01:51:42,870
You see that one?
Yup.

2355
01:51:43,300 --> 01:51:46,690
Holy Shit Man.
That's 100% going to happen.

2356
01:51:47,030 --> 01:51:48,980
It's going to happen.
Oh my God,

2357
01:51:48,981 --> 01:51:51,610
we're so fucked.
We're so fucked.

2358
01:51:52,480 --> 01:51:55,880
We're so fucked.
It's going to have bad.

2359
01:51:55,900 --> 01:51:58,300
It will get bad.
It's going to get really good too.

2360
01:51:58,301 --> 01:52:00,550
I think it's the,
it's at the same time.

2361
01:52:00,580 --> 01:52:01,690
Yeah,
that is true.

2362
01:52:01,990 --> 01:52:04,480
I think it's going to get weird and it's
going to get really good.

2363
01:52:04,650 --> 01:52:06,460
I'm,
I'm very optimistic,

2364
01:52:06,820 --> 01:52:09,490
you know,
a lot of the most,

2365
01:52:10,120 --> 01:52:12,790
I don't know,
a lot of the most informative stuff that

2366
01:52:12,791 --> 01:52:17,791
I learn each and every day are from my
boy that is in college right now,

2367
01:52:19,450 --> 01:52:20,490
Harry.
Yeah.

2368
01:52:21,100 --> 01:52:24,520
And uh,
actually I think he's in charge of,

2369
01:52:24,521 --> 01:52:27,520
uh,
his science clubs,

2370
01:52:27,521 --> 01:52:30,910
social media.
I forget what it's,

2371
01:52:31,120 --> 01:52:34,150
I forget the instagram.
You don't have to look it up,

2372
01:52:34,151 --> 01:52:39,151
Jamie,
but I think it's like Simpson Simpson

2373
01:52:40,030 --> 01:52:42,710
Chemistry club or something.
But he's every day,

2374
01:52:42,820 --> 01:52:46,070
every week he posts different Kim facts,

2375
01:52:46,310 --> 01:52:47,960
like chemistry,
facts.

2376
01:52:48,530 --> 01:52:52,340
Science is crazy.
If you're someone who doesn't really

2377
01:52:52,341 --> 01:52:55,400
study it,
there's a lot of ridiculous information

2378
01:52:55,401 --> 01:52:57,590
out there.
You start looking at that and you

2379
01:52:57,591 --> 01:53:00,470
realize any of the stuff that we're
talking about,

2380
01:53:00,500 --> 01:53:02,060
it's 100% possible.

2381
01:53:02,520 --> 01:53:03,360
Well,
there's,

2382
01:53:03,780 --> 01:53:08,780
every new innovation builds on potential
new innovations that branch off of them

2383
01:53:09,421 --> 01:53:11,430
and they're were always constantly
pushing the curve.

2384
01:53:11,790 --> 01:53:14,760
It's like they're not staying stagnant
in any industry.

2385
01:53:14,790 --> 01:53:17,760
Like there's nothing where
technologically everybody's stagnant.

2386
01:53:17,910 --> 01:53:20,220
Whether it's automobiles,
automobiles,

2387
01:53:20,370 --> 01:53:21,950
like they're,
they're getting better and better every

2388
01:53:21,951 --> 01:53:23,340
day.
Computers better and better.

2389
01:53:23,341 --> 01:53:25,590
Everyday phones,
better and better everyday tvs,

2390
01:53:25,591 --> 01:53:27,450
better in bed.
It's just never ending.

2391
01:53:27,660 --> 01:53:32,100
It's not there.
They are on this constant state of

2392
01:53:32,101 --> 01:53:36,390
innovation and progression that is
really stunning to watch because we're

2393
01:53:36,391 --> 01:53:41,391
almost like watching some cascade of
complexity that is reaching some

2394
01:53:42,660 --> 01:53:44,220
infinite point.
Did the,

2395
01:53:44,221 --> 01:53:47,160
the newest,
latest a htc vives,

2396
01:53:47,161 --> 01:53:48,750
these um,
uh,

2397
01:53:48,780 --> 01:53:51,180
virtual reality goggles that you put on
there,

2398
01:53:51,181 --> 01:53:52,890
just they're letting you know,
hey,

2399
01:53:53,040 --> 01:53:57,270
this is the future.
The future's other realities in pill

2400
01:53:57,271 --> 01:53:59,160
form.
Other realities that are going to be

2401
01:53:59,161 --> 01:54:02,370
able to put your hand on a building.
It's going to send you into another

2402
01:54:02,371 --> 01:54:03,600
dimension.
I mean,

2403
01:54:03,601 --> 01:54:07,230
these are really real things that are
going to address real matrix.

2404
01:54:07,231 --> 01:54:09,960
Really make real matrix within 50 years.

2405
01:54:10,430 --> 01:54:14,730
In 50 years.
Do you think it will desensitize a mean?

2406
01:54:14,790 --> 01:54:16,830
They say video game.
Well,

2407
01:54:17,010 --> 01:54:19,950
back in our day they said music,
right?

2408
01:54:20,340 --> 01:54:23,100
Music was what?
Desensitize people,

2409
01:54:23,820 --> 01:54:25,550
right?
That's the basis of

2410
01:54:25,740 --> 01:54:28,460
now they say video games.
This is right now,

2411
01:54:28,461 --> 01:54:30,090
it's,
trump recently said video games are

2412
01:54:30,091 --> 01:54:31,440
causing violence,
which is like,

2413
01:54:31,441 --> 01:54:32,274
come on man.

2414
01:54:32,300 --> 01:54:35,240
I don't know if it's causing violence,
but I would certainly,

2415
01:54:35,510 --> 01:54:40,510
I would certainly think that people
desensitized to blood and Gore.

2416
01:54:42,470 --> 01:54:44,360
Yeah,
because I mean you're right.

2417
01:54:44,600 --> 01:54:46,670
Back when,
back when we were,

2418
01:54:46,850 --> 01:54:49,220
well you would have been before me,
but

2419
01:54:51,050 --> 01:54:52,490
like,
I don't know,

2420
01:54:52,520 --> 01:54:55,250
grand theft auto.
It was a little bit after my time.

2421
01:54:55,280 --> 01:54:57,980
Like for me it was mortal Kombat.
Oh yeah.

2422
01:54:58,010 --> 01:55:02,870
The adult population couldn't stand
mortal Kombat because you ripped

2423
01:55:02,871 --> 01:55:07,871
someone's spine out and held it up in
the air and that was it calling.

2424
01:55:08,330 --> 01:55:11,930
Can you talk about that though?
Instead of being desensitized,

2425
01:55:11,931 --> 01:55:15,560
aren't they just not sensitive enough
yet because they haven't been exposed to

2426
01:55:15,561 --> 01:55:17,340
it?
So like you write the piece of what

2427
01:55:17,430 --> 01:55:19,640
you're describing,
a combat lived through Vietnam.

2428
01:55:19,641 --> 01:55:21,290
Like they,
they saw all of that

2429
01:55:22,270 --> 01:55:24,040
as kids.
You're a hundred percent correct.

2430
01:55:24,041 --> 01:55:25,470
Powerful young Jamie.
Yeah.

2431
01:55:25,500 --> 01:55:26,810
Good point.
That's a very good,

2432
01:55:27,730 --> 01:55:30,340
very good point.
That's a super good point because that's

2433
01:55:30,341 --> 01:55:32,920
really exactly what's happening.
You know,

2434
01:55:32,921 --> 01:55:36,430
they're not experiencing real violence
and maybe that's the answer.

2435
01:55:36,550 --> 01:55:39,730
Maybe it was like the,
a real understanding of what real

2436
01:55:39,731 --> 01:55:44,010
violence is,
what would make you more of

2437
01:55:44,040 --> 01:55:47,280
real violence.
So the more disconnected we are with

2438
01:55:47,281 --> 01:55:49,290
real violence,
the more,

2439
01:55:49,380 --> 01:55:53,940
almost as cartoonish expression of
violence as being an alternative for

2440
01:55:53,941 --> 01:55:56,130
being bored,
being an alternative,

2441
01:55:56,131 --> 01:56:00,210
being like bullied or tortured.
Like instead of something to be avoided.

2442
01:56:00,211 --> 01:56:03,450
It's like your,
your last hurrah before you exit this

2443
01:56:03,451 --> 01:56:04,610
life.
Like you're,

2444
01:56:04,611 --> 01:56:06,690
you've,
you've flipped over the board game,

2445
01:56:06,691 --> 01:56:10,020
you've pulled the plug out on the video
game ness and this is what,

2446
01:56:10,021 --> 01:56:14,800
like extreme violences that it seems to
be more of that maybe even than

2447
01:56:14,830 --> 01:56:17,790
anything.
Definitely could be.

2448
01:56:18,150 --> 01:56:20,460
I mean,
you know,

2449
01:56:20,610 --> 01:56:23,790
my boy is a,
he's going to school to be a vet

2450
01:56:25,320 --> 01:56:27,570
and he's been,
you know,

2451
01:56:27,571 --> 01:56:29,850
he's able to,
to look at,

2452
01:56:29,880 --> 01:56:34,880
luckily he works for a veterinary clinic
in our town and he's personally been

2453
01:56:35,251 --> 01:56:38,430
there for surgeries and he's been there
for several years.

2454
01:56:38,431 --> 01:56:39,900
So he's seen a lot of things.

2455
01:56:40,470 --> 01:56:41,430
But,
uh,

2456
01:56:42,360 --> 01:56:45,360
the doctors were originally telling him,
you know,

2457
01:56:45,390 --> 01:56:48,060
hey,
if you feel a little bit sensitive this,

2458
01:56:48,061 --> 01:56:50,760
or if you feel like you might pass out,
let us know.

2459
01:56:51,270 --> 01:56:54,990
But you know,
Harry has been with me through a big

2460
01:56:54,991 --> 01:56:58,500
portion of
his life,

2461
01:56:58,501 --> 01:57:03,240
so he's seen one of these things,
seeing things get shot,

2462
01:57:03,480 --> 01:57:06,330
and he'd seen things get,
feel dressed,

2463
01:57:06,780 --> 01:57:11,780
he's seen things get broken apart and
he's seen things get cooked for the

2464
01:57:12,031 --> 01:57:16,050
family.
So he's literally seen all the stages of

2465
01:57:16,051 --> 01:57:18,210
really what life is.
It's a port,

2466
01:57:18,330 --> 01:57:19,680
you know,
it's living,

2467
01:57:20,180 --> 01:57:24,750
it's dying,
and then it's being consumed by what is

2468
01:57:24,751 --> 01:57:26,580
living.
So,

2469
01:57:26,640 --> 01:57:29,370
you know,
they were a little bit surprised by the

2470
01:57:29,371 --> 01:57:33,000
fact that he understood all that.
But I think because he's experienced

2471
01:57:33,001 --> 01:57:36,210
that he did understand it.
Oh,

2472
01:57:36,240 --> 01:57:37,950
for sure.
I mean,

2473
01:57:37,951 --> 01:57:42,660
he's experiencing it in a real life
scenario versus in a video or in a book,

2474
01:57:42,680 --> 01:57:43,020
right?

2475
01:57:43,020 --> 01:57:45,510
You just,
there's no way to learn life from a

2476
01:57:45,511 --> 01:57:48,990
video or a book.
What you can do is get exposed to ideas

2477
01:57:48,991 --> 01:57:51,330
that will intrigue you and you want to
have those experiences.

2478
01:57:51,660 --> 01:57:54,420
But this is a giant difference.
It's like the difference between

2479
01:57:54,421 --> 01:57:59,421
watching porn and having sex,
I literally is right.

2480
01:57:59,730 --> 01:58:01,360
I mean that's the perfect example.
Yeah,

2481
01:58:01,560 --> 01:58:04,240
it actually is.
It is the perfect example of that.

2482
01:58:04,320 --> 01:58:07,560
You have to experience things and until
you do,

2483
01:58:07,620 --> 01:58:09,000
you don't know.
And you know,

2484
01:58:09,001 --> 01:58:10,860
we're always battling for,
you know,

2485
01:58:11,100 --> 01:58:14,880
people take us seriously.
We're always battling for our position

2486
01:58:14,881 --> 01:58:18,540
in the social food chain and all that
clouds the way we communicate with each

2487
01:58:18,541 --> 01:58:21,330
other too.
I think we just have to get way better

2488
01:58:21,331 --> 01:58:26,040
at this and I think we're operating on
some were we're in like this weird snake

2489
01:58:26,041 --> 01:58:30,480
shedding of the skin stage.
We're just got to shake off all the

2490
01:58:30,481 --> 01:58:33,810
stupid shit that was invented by slave
owners.

2491
01:58:34,080 --> 01:58:38,520
All the dumb shit that's been like
involved in our system from the

2492
01:58:38,521 --> 01:58:41,180
beginning.
We have to realize like no one knows

2493
01:58:41,181 --> 01:58:42,130
what the fuck's going on.

2494
01:58:42,340 --> 01:58:46,270
We have to look at everything for what
it really is and forget about the past.

2495
01:58:46,740 --> 01:58:48,930
Can we do right now?
What can we do right now?

2496
01:58:49,480 --> 01:58:54,300
And do you think it's like a lot of
things in life where you really,

2497
01:58:54,301 --> 01:58:58,020
really liked something in,
you almost go too far and then in the

2498
01:58:58,021 --> 01:58:59,370
end you think,
okay,

2499
01:58:59,371 --> 01:59:02,820
we've gone maybe a little bit too far.
We're going to back things off.

2500
01:59:03,240 --> 01:59:05,400
Do you think that's the truth and what
we're doing right now?

2501
01:59:05,430 --> 01:59:10,110
Do you think we're almost becoming too
lenient?

2502
01:59:10,440 --> 01:59:12,300
And then we're going to get to the point
where like,

2503
01:59:12,301 --> 01:59:15,420
you know what,
we have to have some,

2504
01:59:16,340 --> 01:59:21,340
some discipline to where I wasn't a
starbucks the other day I thought about

2505
01:59:22,771 --> 01:59:23,880
posting it,
but I didn't,

2506
01:59:23,940 --> 01:59:25,470
I actually thought about sending it to
you,

2507
01:59:25,471 --> 01:59:26,670
but I didn't.
But it was,

2508
01:59:29,310 --> 01:59:32,430
it was in a starbucks and it said,
uh,

2509
01:59:32,490 --> 01:59:35,460
there was a bathroom that said any sex
and there was a male,

2510
01:59:35,490 --> 01:59:38,190
a woman and a guy in a wheelchair.
I'm like,

2511
01:59:38,191 --> 01:59:42,990
since when?
Since when is a a person in a

2512
01:59:42,991 --> 01:59:45,330
wheelchair,
a sex like,

2513
01:59:45,390 --> 01:59:48,180
you know,
it's almost like they're afraid to,

2514
01:59:48,610 --> 01:59:53,610
to put something on the door to where
they just make it as broad as possible

2515
01:59:56,000 --> 01:59:57,180
and it's like,
you know,

2516
01:59:57,181 --> 02:00:01,530
we have to have,
we have to have some lines.

2517
02:00:01,950 --> 02:00:04,980
Otherwise it's just nothing but gray.
Well there's not,

2518
02:00:05,090 --> 02:00:08,200
here's the thing man.
I think all this is in response to the

2519
02:00:08,201 --> 02:00:10,570
idea that men and women are competing
against each other.

2520
02:00:10,810 --> 02:00:12,610
I think that's what we've got to cut the
shit.

2521
02:00:13,090 --> 02:00:18,090
I think if this idea that like there's a
diff,

2522
02:00:18,880 --> 02:00:20,710
like there's no doubt

2523
02:00:21,280 --> 02:00:22,540
that you need women

2524
02:00:24,310 --> 02:00:26,860
and you need men.
We need humans,

2525
02:00:26,920 --> 02:00:28,090
right?
We need each other.

2526
02:00:28,240 --> 02:00:30,430
Yup.
So we've got to figure out like why is

2527
02:00:30,431 --> 02:00:33,400
everybody so hung up on gender?
Is there an imbalance?

2528
02:00:33,700 --> 02:00:36,730
And whatever that imbalance is,
it's got to be corrected,

2529
02:00:37,000 --> 02:00:42,000
but it's got to be corrected honorably
and it's got to be corrected.

2530
02:00:42,460 --> 02:00:44,740
Honestly.
Like we have to be nice to each other.

2531
02:00:44,770 --> 02:00:46,270
All of us,
we like each other.

2532
02:00:46,450 --> 02:00:48,220
Girls like boys,
boys like girls.

2533
02:00:48,221 --> 02:00:51,370
That's how it's always been.
And any aberrations of that can really

2534
02:00:51,371 --> 02:00:54,430
fuck your head up,
but I think they're more aberrations

2535
02:00:54,460 --> 02:00:57,520
than they are the norm and I think we
have to figure out how to make those

2536
02:00:57,521 --> 02:01:01,570
aberrations lesser and lesser and no
one's concentrating on that.

2537
02:01:01,600 --> 02:01:03,310
Instead,
they're concentrating on boys versus

2538
02:01:03,311 --> 02:01:06,910
girls and I think that's crazy.
It's like if you only like men,

2539
02:01:06,911 --> 02:01:08,260
I can't hang out with you,
dude.

2540
02:01:08,490 --> 02:01:10,990
You're going to say some fucked up shit
about women and I'm going to go,

2541
02:01:10,991 --> 02:01:12,820
that's my daughter.
That's my sister.

2542
02:01:12,821 --> 02:01:14,890
That's my mom.
You can't do that.

2543
02:01:15,130 --> 02:01:19,810
Like this idea that like we're on a team
and we're on team dicks and team vaginas

2544
02:01:19,811 --> 02:01:23,410
trying to fucking steal our gold.
Like this is stupid.

2545
02:01:23,560 --> 02:01:25,720
It's stupid.
It's stupid.

2546
02:01:25,750 --> 02:01:28,720
We can't do that anymore.
Just like we can't do team white people.

2547
02:01:28,870 --> 02:01:30,070
Right.
That's not good either.

2548
02:01:30,640 --> 02:01:33,880
It's not good team.
A fucking beige people.

2549
02:01:33,970 --> 02:01:36,730
If you all beige people,
all beige people speak Spanish,

2550
02:01:36,731 --> 02:01:38,410
get on a team.
Come on.

2551
02:01:38,620 --> 02:01:41,180
What are we doing?
It's all the same.

2552
02:01:41,181 --> 02:01:43,940
It's whether it's,
whether it's sexual orientation,

2553
02:01:43,941 --> 02:01:45,200
whether it's gay,
straight,

2554
02:01:45,201 --> 02:01:46,580
whether it's black,
white,

2555
02:01:46,610 --> 02:01:47,810
male,
female,

2556
02:01:48,240 --> 02:01:49,280
Asian,
Spanish,

2557
02:01:49,281 --> 02:01:51,770
Galleon people,
people,

2558
02:01:51,771 --> 02:01:53,240
nice people,
interesting people,

2559
02:01:53,241 --> 02:01:55,730
different people.
We have to learn that we're in a global

2560
02:01:55,731 --> 02:01:57,830
community,
like who really have to figure it out.

2561
02:01:58,220 --> 02:02:01,010
And we're closer and closer than we've
ever been before.

2562
02:02:01,011 --> 02:02:02,840
But along the way we're going to get
ridiculous shit.

2563
02:02:03,230 --> 02:02:06,950
We're going to get like people that are
completely overreacting and all men are

2564
02:02:06,951 --> 02:02:11,900
sexist and all men are rapists and all
sex with a penis and vagina is rape.

2565
02:02:12,200 --> 02:02:13,970
And there's like,
there's a lot of that going on right

2566
02:02:13,971 --> 02:02:14,750
now,
but that's,

2567
02:02:14,750 --> 02:02:18,170
those are the echoes of the farthest
reaches of the idea.

2568
02:02:18,171 --> 02:02:20,870
And then that idea,
we'll pull back into the middle and then

2569
02:02:20,871 --> 02:02:23,570
the general consensus will be
established.

2570
02:02:24,020 --> 02:02:24,980
That's what people do.

2571
02:02:25,690 --> 02:02:27,940
Did I ever tell you about the time I
went to India?

2572
02:02:28,510 --> 02:02:29,920
No,
I did.

2573
02:02:30,700 --> 02:02:33,610
I don't think so.
I went to India for just short of a

2574
02:02:33,611 --> 02:02:36,880
month coaching.
And uh,

2575
02:02:36,980 --> 02:02:38,830
you did tell me this.
Oh,

2576
02:02:38,831 --> 02:02:40,810
now I remember.
Yeah,

2577
02:02:41,860 --> 02:02:44,830
it's a pretty good story.
But the first part was I wanted to try

2578
02:02:44,831 --> 02:02:47,010
to blend in.
I never been to a third,

2579
02:02:47,350 --> 02:02:52,350
third large giant man in America,
in America,

2580
02:02:53,030 --> 02:02:54,640
you know,
do we take pictures together?

2581
02:02:54,641 --> 02:02:56,080
I'm like,
it's like,

2582
02:02:56,110 --> 02:02:58,990
it's cute.
I'm like looking up at your armpits so

2583
02:02:58,991 --> 02:03:02,290
you are in your giant for a place that
doesn't have giant people.

2584
02:03:02,380 --> 02:03:03,660
I told him,
I said I will,

2585
02:03:03,730 --> 02:03:06,250
I'll come down and coach,
I'll work for a month.

2586
02:03:06,280 --> 02:03:07,113
But I said,
I,

2587
02:03:07,160 --> 02:03:09,310
you know,
I was more worried about my safety than

2588
02:03:09,311 --> 02:03:11,380
anything.
So I said I'll come down,

2589
02:03:11,381 --> 02:03:13,290
but you know,
I really want to,

2590
02:03:14,170 --> 02:03:16,750
I want to have a good flight.

2591
02:03:17,020 --> 02:03:19,100
You know,
I was going along way and said I want

2592
02:03:19,101 --> 02:03:20,830
to,
if I'm on the train,

2593
02:03:20,920 --> 02:03:22,960
cause I knew I had about a four hour
train ride.

2594
02:03:22,990 --> 02:03:25,060
I said I want first class,
you know,

2595
02:03:25,420 --> 02:03:29,680
start to finish.
And I don't want to sound like a Prima

2596
02:03:29,680 --> 02:03:31,390
Donna,
but I also knew that I was going to a

2597
02:03:31,391 --> 02:03:35,110
third world country.
So asking for first class doesn't

2598
02:03:35,140 --> 02:03:39,490
necessarily mean firstclass here.
Um,

2599
02:03:39,700 --> 02:03:44,140
so anyway,
firstclass meant that my seats on my

2600
02:03:44,141 --> 02:03:45,650
train had,
um,

2601
02:03:45,670 --> 02:03:50,670
vinyl covering on there.
So I flew into my airport,

2602
02:03:52,090 --> 02:03:54,100
got off the train,
I was trying to blend in,

2603
02:03:54,130 --> 02:03:58,510
had some old blue jeans on,
gray shirt,

2604
02:03:58,870 --> 02:04:03,820
literally stepped off and it was like
the DJ fricking scratch the record from

2605
02:04:03,821 --> 02:04:06,940
like song five to song one.
It was like,

2606
02:04:07,440 --> 02:04:08,273
yeah.

2607
02:04:09,030 --> 02:04:14,030
And literally every single like a sea of
people that were two feet shorter than

2608
02:04:14,911 --> 02:04:18,300
me just literally stopped trains,
stopped everything,

2609
02:04:18,301 --> 02:04:23,301
stopped everyone looked at the six and a
half foot dude standing in this Indian

2610
02:04:26,160 --> 02:04:29,940
fricking trained train depot.
And uh,

2611
02:04:29,970 --> 02:04:34,190
I thought all right,
so I'm to so much for blending in and

2612
02:04:34,191 --> 02:04:38,310
went up to the first class,
a train lounge,

2613
02:04:38,311 --> 02:04:42,870
which was pretty much the train's loud,
a train lounge that had seats.

2614
02:04:43,410 --> 02:04:46,520
Um,
went up there and made friends with the

2615
02:04:46,530 --> 02:04:51,530
cockroach that was in the bathroom.
And then I got on the train,

2616
02:04:52,170 --> 02:04:54,830
uh,
did about three to four hours on a

2617
02:04:54,831 --> 02:04:56,080
train.
Uh,

2618
02:04:56,100 --> 02:05:00,240
we stopped a few times cause there were
some cows on the tracks.

2619
02:05:00,420 --> 02:05:02,340
You're not allowed to mess with the
cows.

2620
02:05:02,341 --> 02:05:06,210
I guess so we had to wait for them to
naturally move off the tracks.

2621
02:05:06,570 --> 02:05:09,510
Beep.
There was actually two dead bodies on

2622
02:05:09,511 --> 02:05:10,344
our train.

2623
02:05:10,770 --> 02:05:15,690
Have I ever told you this?
There are two dead bodies and they put

2624
02:05:15,691 --> 02:05:20,220
the dead bodies in the,
on the floor of the aisle between the

2625
02:05:20,221 --> 02:05:24,090
people.
So our s our seats had vinyl on there.

2626
02:05:24,091 --> 02:05:27,420
The first class,
the non firstclass did not.

2627
02:05:27,990 --> 02:05:31,380
I remember at one point I looked back
in,

2628
02:05:32,160 --> 02:05:35,700
there was two dead bodies that had
sheets over him.

2629
02:05:36,330 --> 02:05:40,320
And then in the far back of the train,
like where the trains connect,

2630
02:05:40,770 --> 02:05:42,620
there was actually a,
um,

2631
02:05:42,780 --> 02:05:47,780
an Indian guy that was squatting down
pretty much rip and has dong a backwards

2632
02:05:49,861 --> 02:05:53,930
so that he could take a leak while the
in between the trains.

2633
02:05:53,931 --> 02:05:58,931
Like he opened the door and he was
squatting down letting one rip between

2634
02:05:59,131 --> 02:06:01,350
the trains.
And uh,

2635
02:06:01,650 --> 02:06:03,210
yeah,
I was sitting there thinking,

2636
02:06:03,330 --> 02:06:06,720
Oh man,
I've got 20 days left here.

2637
02:06:07,880 --> 02:06:11,850
But in saying that,
once I got to where I was,

2638
02:06:12,390 --> 02:06:15,330
um,
they were probably the best students

2639
02:06:15,331 --> 02:06:18,780
I've ever had because they were the most
disciplined.

2640
02:06:18,930 --> 02:06:23,930
Every one of those students wanted to
get out of that lifestyle and they saw

2641
02:06:24,841 --> 02:06:29,841
that being a national level shooter was
going to get them out of that lifestyle.

2642
02:06:31,290 --> 02:06:36,290
So every single thing I taught them,
they took it to a level that was far

2643
02:06:36,901 --> 02:06:41,640
beyond what most people here would ever,
ever,

2644
02:06:41,670 --> 02:06:44,400
ever do.
Did they build as well?

2645
02:06:44,401 --> 02:06:48,750
Did they build beaus they teach them how
to do all that stuff to their peeps?

2646
02:06:48,840 --> 02:06:51,300
Some of their,
some of the people on their national

2647
02:06:51,301 --> 02:06:52,650
team,
their peep site,

2648
02:06:52,680 --> 02:06:57,680
which is the small little circle that's
in your bow string that allows you to

2649
02:06:57,960 --> 02:06:59,940
kind of,
it's almost like,

2650
02:06:59,970 --> 02:07:03,120
if you can imagine a rifle he ever rear
sight and a front sight.

2651
02:07:03,150 --> 02:07:07,950
So the peep side is in your string.
It's a circle and it's your rear sight

2652
02:07:07,980 --> 02:07:09,750
and then you align it with the front
sight.

2653
02:07:10,260 --> 02:07:13,230
There's was,
theirs was made out of wood.

2654
02:07:14,250 --> 02:07:17,790
They would have a stick with a hole
drilled in it and they would put that in

2655
02:07:17,791 --> 02:07:19,530
their string.
Wow.

2656
02:07:19,890 --> 02:07:24,890
So imagine someone like that in your,
they're giving him instruction and every

2657
02:07:25,681 --> 02:07:29,700
single thing you tell them to do,
they'll do it to the 10th degree because

2658
02:07:30,000 --> 02:07:32,790
they want out.
I mean,

2659
02:07:32,820 --> 02:07:37,630
it was extreme motivation.
I felt like everything that I was doing

2660
02:07:37,631 --> 02:07:41,470
from a training point of view was
inadequate to what they were doing.

2661
02:07:41,471 --> 02:07:46,471
The only difference was they didn't have
the education that we had.

2662
02:07:47,440 --> 02:07:49,750
They were disconnected.
I remember,

2663
02:07:49,751 --> 02:07:52,990
um,
I would actually have to go to an

2664
02:07:52,991 --> 02:07:57,991
Internet cafe and I'd have to pay for
five minutes of Internet,

2665
02:07:58,420 --> 02:08:03,370
like dial up internet to call Sharon.
So,

2666
02:08:03,371 --> 02:08:05,380
I mean,
you look at people that are like that,

2667
02:08:05,950 --> 02:08:10,660
they want it at a level that's so far
beyond what a lot of,

2668
02:08:11,020 --> 02:08:13,330
I mean,
we're just floating in the gravy over

2669
02:08:13,331 --> 02:08:14,164
here.

2670
02:08:14,260 --> 02:08:15,040
I mean,
it's,

2671
02:08:15,040 --> 02:08:16,900
it's true.
It's true.

2672
02:08:16,930 --> 02:08:17,741
It's totally true.
Yeah.

2673
02:08:17,741 --> 02:08:20,470
You look at some of the,
some of the people I've,

2674
02:08:20,471 --> 02:08:23,050
um,
I was a keynote speaker at an,

2675
02:08:23,051 --> 02:08:26,770
uh,
an international coaching convention in

2676
02:08:27,040 --> 02:08:32,040
Brazil before the Olympics there.
And you go down there and you realize

2677
02:08:33,700 --> 02:08:38,700
some of these people are,
they want it way more than the people

2678
02:08:40,361 --> 02:08:43,540
that have it easy and the,
and that was the case though,

2679
02:08:43,541 --> 02:08:43,961
right?
Yeah.

2680
02:08:43,961 --> 02:08:46,480
That's the case.
That's the people that are hungry are

2681
02:08:46,481 --> 02:08:50,080
the ones that are really struggling to
make it.

2682
02:08:50,950 --> 02:08:53,020
And that's what gets tough is,
you know,

2683
02:08:53,021 --> 02:08:55,690
learning to stay on top.
Um,

2684
02:08:56,170 --> 02:09:00,820
when you have it easy,
when there's people that are literally

2685
02:09:01,540 --> 02:09:06,160
investing every single day and getting
to that point.

2686
02:09:06,620 --> 02:09:07,311
Yeah.
It's,

2687
02:09:07,311 --> 02:09:08,750
that's the fuel,
right?

2688
02:09:08,840 --> 02:09:11,210
Those,
that's one of the weird things is very

2689
02:09:11,211 --> 02:09:16,211
few people who grow up with like some
crazy inheritance plan and millions

2690
02:09:17,720 --> 02:09:19,840
dollars in the bank as well.
That's a bond problem.

2691
02:09:19,880 --> 02:09:22,700
I think it's a giant prior,
I think it's a big problem.

2692
02:09:22,910 --> 02:09:26,900
It's a giant problem with those people.
Anybody that grows up in that scenario

2693
02:09:27,410 --> 02:09:32,410
where you are never really taught the
value of accomplishing things and then

2694
02:09:33,351 --> 02:09:35,780
it's,
it's not just about securing your fate,

2695
02:09:36,110 --> 02:09:40,160
it's also about managing your
consciousness and accomplishing things

2696
02:09:40,250 --> 02:09:42,410
is good for you and you can't think it's
not.

2697
02:09:42,440 --> 02:09:46,640
You have to just accept it and learn it
and think of it as a sort of a growing

2698
02:09:46,641 --> 02:09:49,310
experience.
And if you don't do that,

2699
02:09:49,311 --> 02:09:50,690
you're not going to grow.
And if you don't grow,

2700
02:09:50,691 --> 02:09:52,340
you're going to be fucked.
You're going to be fucked.

2701
02:09:52,341 --> 02:09:54,830
Whether you're rich or you're poor,
it's your missing the thing.

2702
02:09:55,010 --> 02:09:58,370
The thing is now how many Zeros and ones
you collect.

2703
02:09:58,460 --> 02:10:02,420
That's not the thing.
The thing is like how well do you feel

2704
02:10:02,480 --> 02:10:06,380
while you're going through it?
And if you're doing it wrong,

2705
02:10:06,410 --> 02:10:07,700
you've got to figure out what it is.
Well,

2706
02:10:07,701 --> 02:10:10,580
obviously having $1 million in the bank
is not doing it right.

2707
02:10:10,581 --> 02:10:12,920
If the dude's still taking pills and
super depressed,

2708
02:10:13,100 --> 02:10:14,300
it's not the money.
Right?

2709
02:10:14,301 --> 02:10:16,200
So what is it?
What's the thing in you?

2710
02:10:16,201 --> 02:10:19,430
And I have both met a lot of people in
that category.

2711
02:10:19,431 --> 02:10:23,000
I think everybody you talk to on the,
everybody that's goes through,

2712
02:10:23,001 --> 02:10:24,260
it's hard.
Life is hard.

2713
02:10:24,470 --> 02:10:26,180
There's a lot of people that have
fallen,

2714
02:10:26,540 --> 02:10:29,030
fallen into that category,
and it could have been me.

2715
02:10:29,031 --> 02:10:31,580
It easily could've.
I had different scenarios,

2716
02:10:31,581 --> 02:10:32,960
different circumstances,
different,

2717
02:10:34,000 --> 02:10:35,000
you know,
different neighborhood.

2718
02:10:35,001 --> 02:10:36,150
I grew up.
In any case,

2719
02:10:36,230 --> 02:10:37,990
it can go wrong.
You,

2720
02:10:37,991 --> 02:10:41,150
you,
you can go down the dark road and all of

2721
02:10:41,151 --> 02:10:42,710
a sudden you're fucked.
That's,

2722
02:10:42,711 --> 02:10:46,010
that's the case for all of us.
Do you feel like,

2723
02:10:46,250 --> 02:10:47,360
I feel,
you know,

2724
02:10:47,361 --> 02:10:50,870
a lot of people look at me as an archer.
I've been,

2725
02:10:50,871 --> 02:10:51,381
uh,
uh,

2726
02:10:51,381 --> 02:10:53,870
made a very,
very good career.

2727
02:10:54,500 --> 02:10:58,940
I couldn't possibly have made it better.
I don't think for B for shooting a bow

2728
02:10:58,941 --> 02:11:01,910
for living.
I don't think I could have made it

2729
02:11:01,911 --> 02:11:05,360
better.
And there's definitely archers that are

2730
02:11:05,361 --> 02:11:08,150
better than me.
I never claimed to be the best.

2731
02:11:08,180 --> 02:11:12,500
I just claim to be the one that is
willing to share the most.

2732
02:11:12,890 --> 02:11:17,180
I don't claim that I have the most
natural title talent.

2733
02:11:17,240 --> 02:11:20,660
I just feel like I,
I'm willing to share the most,

2734
02:11:21,890 --> 02:11:26,890
but I dunno.
I also feel like feel like there's this,

2735
02:11:28,280 --> 02:11:31,820
I don't know,
this part of me that feels like if I

2736
02:11:31,821 --> 02:11:35,450
didn't,
even though I don't have necessarily

2737
02:11:35,451 --> 02:11:38,540
talent,
the fact that I am willing to share it,

2738
02:11:38,541 --> 02:11:43,541
I think it takes it to a different level
because I don't know if I've ever shared

2739
02:11:43,641 --> 02:11:44,510
this with you.

2740
02:11:44,810 --> 02:11:48,140
Do you know about my past as a kid?
Yeah.

2741
02:11:48,290 --> 02:11:49,790
You,
you told me a lot of different things

2742
02:11:49,791 --> 02:11:51,860
about you burn your house down
accidentally.

2743
02:11:53,180 --> 02:11:54,200
I did.
Okay.

2744
02:11:54,650 --> 02:11:56,150
Yeah.
So a big,

2745
02:11:56,300 --> 02:12:00,920
a big part of why I actually joined
sports to begin with because originally

2746
02:12:00,921 --> 02:12:04,280
I was a skater.
I like to skate and um,

2747
02:12:04,640 --> 02:12:07,160
you know,
I wasn't really into organized sports.

2748
02:12:07,700 --> 02:12:10,280
And the craziest thing is you abandoning
football.

2749
02:12:10,700 --> 02:12:11,750
Yeah.
For archery.

2750
02:12:11,780 --> 02:12:12,830
Yeah.
Well,

2751
02:12:13,370 --> 02:12:16,670
but before that,
the reason I got into football's because

2752
02:12:16,671 --> 02:12:21,200
my dad was such a great athlete that,
you know,

2753
02:12:21,320 --> 02:12:25,100
I played with matches and took it too
far,

2754
02:12:25,130 --> 02:12:30,130
ended up burning my house down,
literally had nothing.

2755
02:12:30,380 --> 02:12:33,260
My mom was in Puerto Rico on a business
trip.

2756
02:12:33,261 --> 02:12:35,640
My Dad was at work,
burned her house.

2757
02:12:35,641 --> 02:12:37,490
So the ground.
Um,

2758
02:12:38,090 --> 02:12:42,260
I remember being there when my family
was sifting through ashes,

2759
02:12:42,290 --> 02:12:47,290
literally trying to find something to
salvage from our history as a family.

2760
02:12:48,380 --> 02:12:52,760
Um,
and my dad was such a stellar athlete

2761
02:12:52,820 --> 02:12:57,230
that I felt like the only thing I could
do to really make him proud of me at

2762
02:12:57,231 --> 02:13:02,231
that point was become a good athlete.
So I focus on becoming a good athlete.

2763
02:13:04,220 --> 02:13:09,220
And that was my drive was because it
wasn't because I really liked it.

2764
02:13:09,350 --> 02:13:11,690
It was because of the fee.
It was because of guilt.

2765
02:13:12,110 --> 02:13:17,110
It was because I really felt like the
only thing I could do to make my dad who

2766
02:13:18,381 --> 02:13:19,910
was,
um,

2767
02:13:21,080 --> 02:13:24,140
a military guy,
someone who had definitely earned a

2768
02:13:24,141 --> 02:13:27,380
street creds.
I felt like the only thing I could do

2769
02:13:27,381 --> 02:13:32,381
was become this great athlete,
which he was in order to earn his

2770
02:13:32,851 --> 02:13:36,900
respect.
And Kennedy did that in order to make up

2771
02:13:36,901 --> 02:13:38,730
for the fact that,
you know,

2772
02:13:38,731 --> 02:13:43,731
I had this one moment as an adolescent
where I literally burn down every single

2773
02:13:45,601 --> 02:13:47,160
thing our family ever had.

2774
02:13:48,540 --> 02:13:51,390
Holy Shit,
man.

2775
02:13:51,780 --> 02:13:52,860
I mean,
imagine going.

2776
02:13:52,950 --> 02:13:55,260
Imagine,
right now when we're done with this

2777
02:13:55,261 --> 02:13:57,690
podcast,
you get a call and you realize your

2778
02:13:57,691 --> 02:14:02,691
house was on fire and
it's different now because we have

2779
02:14:03,271 --> 02:14:06,330
phones.
But imagine we don't have phones.

2780
02:14:07,350 --> 02:14:10,890
Every single picture you have of your
family,

2781
02:14:11,590 --> 02:14:16,170
you know every single one is gone.
Every,

2782
02:14:16,800 --> 02:14:20,140
you know,
every single thing that maybe someone's

2783
02:14:20,160 --> 02:14:24,210
signed for you and the UFC has gone
every single year.

2784
02:14:24,211 --> 02:14:27,750
Black belt that you got from Eddie is
burn.

2785
02:14:27,960 --> 02:14:30,090
It's gone.
Like that's gone.

2786
02:14:31,020 --> 02:14:36,020
Every single thing from right now into
till you were born is gone.

2787
02:14:39,540 --> 02:14:42,600
That's what my parents loss and it was
because of me.

2788
02:14:43,140 --> 02:14:46,680
So you know what man,
they did lose you.

2789
02:14:47,100 --> 02:14:50,430
I think ultimately the difference
between you making a mistake of burn the

2790
02:14:50,431 --> 02:14:51,810
house down,
which is horrific.

2791
02:14:52,050 --> 02:14:53,370
Are you dying?
Yup.

2792
02:14:53,430 --> 02:14:55,410
That's the big difference.
Like everything worked out.

2793
02:14:55,410 --> 02:14:56,310
Look,
hey you are,

2794
02:14:56,430 --> 02:14:57,480
everything's great.
Well,

2795
02:14:57,481 --> 02:15:00,540
and that's,
that's what was great about my dad was

2796
02:15:00,541 --> 02:15:05,541
the fact that once that moment happened,
my mom and my dad have never ever

2797
02:15:06,270 --> 02:15:08,280
brought that up.
They've never hold that.

2798
02:15:08,460 --> 02:15:12,900
They've never held that over me.
It's been me from the outside looking in

2799
02:15:12,901 --> 02:15:17,901
thinking they've never mentioned this
because they know that I feel so bad

2800
02:15:18,061 --> 02:15:23,061
about it,
but me being competitive as a,

2801
02:15:24,210 --> 02:15:29,160
as an athlete was because I wanted to
make my dad proud from that aspect and

2802
02:15:29,190 --> 02:15:34,190
literally that competitive drive as a
football player and track or whatever

2803
02:15:35,731 --> 02:15:39,510
else that,
that fed the archery side.

2804
02:15:39,511 --> 02:15:42,270
Because when I went to my archery
tournament for the first time and I

2805
02:15:42,271 --> 02:15:47,271
sucked at it,
I was naturally competitive and really

2806
02:15:47,431 --> 02:15:51,000
wanted to be better at it.
Now that wasn't because of the fire,

2807
02:15:51,001 --> 02:15:56,001
but that was just because of really
because of a principle that competitive

2808
02:15:57,391 --> 02:16:00,180
sports put in me,
you know?

2809
02:16:00,450 --> 02:16:03,210
So it,
it's crazy how,

2810
02:16:03,230 --> 02:16:05,910
uh,
it's crazy how it all these little

2811
02:16:05,911 --> 02:16:10,290
pieces build character.
But you know,

2812
02:16:10,291 --> 02:16:12,050
that's why,
um,

2813
02:16:12,660 --> 02:16:17,660
several weeks ago there was a really big
archery tournament and I actually got

2814
02:16:18,091 --> 02:16:19,380
wind,
which I'm not,

2815
02:16:19,800 --> 02:16:24,800
I'm not big on kind of feeding in or
buying into negativity at all.

2816
02:16:27,120 --> 02:16:31,780
But there was some,
some negativity that I heard from other

2817
02:16:32,050 --> 02:16:35,170
shooters that are shooting now and
shooting currently saying,

2818
02:16:35,710 --> 02:16:37,090
you know,
why is this guy,

2819
02:16:37,780 --> 02:16:40,390
why is this guy popular?
Why is it a successful?

2820
02:16:40,391 --> 02:16:43,360
He's not even shooting right now.
He's not even competing.

2821
02:16:43,780 --> 02:16:46,060
And you know,
yeah.

2822
02:16:46,120 --> 02:16:50,440
Dirty Green Monster and V.
Yeah,

2823
02:16:50,470 --> 02:16:53,210
exactly.
It is John Dudley get all the,

2824
02:16:53,640 --> 02:16:54,730
yeah.
And,

2825
02:16:55,510 --> 02:16:57,220
and I,
I've been pretty,

2826
02:16:57,221 --> 02:17:01,150
uh,
are you going to do gollum again?

2827
02:17:01,630 --> 02:17:04,420
He did that on the last podcast.
That's not calling.

2828
02:17:04,750 --> 02:17:06,480
It's pretty good though.
Um,

2829
02:17:07,020 --> 02:17:08,080
I dunno.
I feel like,

2830
02:17:08,320 --> 02:17:12,430
I feel like these people that,
that feed on the negativity,

2831
02:17:12,431 --> 02:17:15,850
they don't understand that all these
little things that have happened or

2832
02:17:15,851 --> 02:17:20,851
building blocks and I want to use it as
motivation to the people out there.

2833
02:17:23,140 --> 02:17:25,840
Not everyone has a perfect picture,
you know,

2834
02:17:25,841 --> 02:17:29,140
people see where maybe you and I are
now,

2835
02:17:29,170 --> 02:17:34,170
but they don't realize.
We also had huge hurdles before we got

2836
02:17:34,661 --> 02:17:37,330
here.
And it's how you address those,

2837
02:17:37,540 --> 02:17:41,890
you know,
and how you take adversity.

2838
02:17:42,400 --> 02:17:46,240
That's really who defines you and it's a
really,

2839
02:17:46,241 --> 02:17:51,241
really good opportunity for you to,
to set a precedence of I had hardship,

2840
02:17:52,990 --> 02:17:55,420
I made over it.
And you know,

2841
02:17:55,421 --> 02:18:00,421
you can become inspiration for people by
having that obstacle and then overcoming

2842
02:18:02,831 --> 02:18:02,990
it.

2843
02:18:02,990 --> 02:18:04,580
Yeah.
Well I think that's the big point is

2844
02:18:04,581 --> 02:18:06,360
that we all learned from each other.
Now,

2845
02:18:06,470 --> 02:18:10,790
most certainly learned from you telling
me about your struggles as well as I

2846
02:18:10,791 --> 02:18:14,330
have from most of my friends that tell
me about their struggles or things that

2847
02:18:14,331 --> 02:18:17,990
I've read about or things that I've seen
in documentaries or things we learn from

2848
02:18:17,991 --> 02:18:18,711
each other.
And you,

2849
02:18:18,711 --> 02:18:19,520
you get,
uh,

2850
02:18:19,520 --> 02:18:22,490
we're,
I think we're all accumulating data as

2851
02:18:22,491 --> 02:18:25,820
far as like how the world works,
what's the best way to behave and what's

2852
02:18:25,821 --> 02:18:28,130
the best way to live.
And we're all in the middle of

2853
02:18:28,131 --> 02:18:30,860
accumulating all this data.
We're all taking it and inform each

2854
02:18:30,861 --> 02:18:32,570
other and we've gotta be open to it.
You know,

2855
02:18:32,571 --> 02:18:36,320
you've got to be open to taking it from
even like,

2856
02:18:36,440 --> 02:18:38,360
although it seems kind of corny
sometimes,

2857
02:18:38,600 --> 02:18:43,370
like I will read some shit by the rock
or I will watch a Kevin Hart instagram

2858
02:18:43,371 --> 02:18:45,170
video and I get fucking fired up.

2859
02:18:45,190 --> 02:18:47,830
I'm like,
I'm going to go do this man and mean if

2860
02:18:47,831 --> 02:18:51,260
it's not jocko saying good or if it's
not just dope.

2861
02:18:51,530 --> 02:18:54,500
Or when I think about that David Goggins
podcasts,

2862
02:18:54,530 --> 02:18:58,610
I did very good dude.
I think about Goggins and my Jesus

2863
02:18:58,610 --> 02:18:59,443
Christ.
Yeah.

2864
02:18:59,450 --> 02:19:02,120
I just,
I can't even understand that kind of

2865
02:19:02,180 --> 02:19:04,210
mental intensity.
That'd be just,

2866
02:19:04,670 --> 02:19:06,020
he was freaking me out,
man,

2867
02:19:06,140 --> 02:19:08,600
who's freaking me out and the most
impressive way,

2868
02:19:08,601 --> 02:19:09,400
like,
I just like,

2869
02:19:09,400 --> 02:19:12,490
I'm like,
he was 100% that goes 100% seriously

2870
02:19:12,500 --> 02:19:13,830
ready to die,
uh,

2871
02:19:13,831 --> 02:19:15,620
on a foot race.
He's ready to die.

2872
02:19:15,920 --> 02:19:18,290
100% he's looking at,
he's not lying at all,

2873
02:19:18,610 --> 02:19:22,220
was not no party.
He's taking it to the dark lands.

2874
02:19:22,221 --> 02:19:23,630
He's going to take you to the dark
lands.

2875
02:19:23,810 --> 02:19:27,080
Will you follow?
Will you follow him to the dark lands

2876
02:19:27,110 --> 02:19:32,110
gam those ceos and does the same?
He took us to the dark land with

2877
02:19:33,561 --> 02:19:35,900
Tequila,
the Tequila universe.

2878
02:19:36,200 --> 02:19:37,550
Well,
he'll do it with everything.

2879
02:19:37,790 --> 02:19:39,080
He's an animal,
but,

2880
02:19:39,140 --> 02:19:42,260
but those,
those people and they expresses itself

2881
02:19:42,261 --> 02:19:44,390
differently in all these different
exceptional people.

2882
02:19:44,391 --> 02:19:47,120
Like Jocko is different than Tim.
Tim Kennedy.

2883
02:19:47,390 --> 02:19:49,250
Ted Kennedy is different than Andy
there.

2884
02:19:49,270 --> 02:19:53,420
There were all different but also all
incredibly exceptional.

2885
02:19:53,450 --> 02:19:55,040
But there's something that they give
off.

2886
02:19:55,350 --> 02:19:58,100
I like that though.
When you talked about the exception

2887
02:19:58,130 --> 02:19:59,320
among the accent.

2888
02:19:59,610 --> 02:20:00,720
Yeah,
that's what,

2889
02:20:00,721 --> 02:20:01,560
um,
I think,

2890
02:20:01,561 --> 02:20:03,840
um,
he'd called it David Goggins called it

2891
02:20:04,200 --> 02:20:07,260
uncommon amongst uncommon people.
That's true.

2892
02:20:08,040 --> 02:20:09,630
Yeah.
That is very,

2893
02:20:09,631 --> 02:20:12,420
very true.
That's the Colby Bryan and killing

2894
02:20:12,421 --> 02:20:17,421
people right there.
They just,

2895
02:20:18,270 --> 02:20:20,190
I mean,
I read this thing about Kobe Bryant the

2896
02:20:20,190 --> 02:20:20,990
other day.
I was just reading,

2897
02:20:20,990 --> 02:20:23,220
oh,
I don't know anything about basketball.

2898
02:20:23,280 --> 02:20:25,380
Okay.
And I always refer to Jamie,

2899
02:20:25,530 --> 02:20:29,400
but anything in basketball,
I have zero idea.

2900
02:20:29,700 --> 02:20:31,350
I don't know how long it takes,
can take a day.

2901
02:20:31,440 --> 02:20:33,330
How many corridors?
I have no idea.

2902
02:20:33,630 --> 02:20:36,030
I would imagine if you say quarters,
I'd say there's four of them.

2903
02:20:36,500 --> 02:20:38,750
Can you see how many periods?
I don't know how many.

2904
02:20:38,760 --> 02:20:40,710
Half Times,
but it was reading all this stuff about

2905
02:20:40,980 --> 02:20:43,410
his high school coach saying that they
would,

2906
02:20:43,440 --> 02:20:47,550
they would get there and he would be
shooting baskets in the dark because

2907
02:20:47,551 --> 02:20:49,260
they hadn't even turned the lights on
yet.

2908
02:20:49,380 --> 02:20:53,250
He'd be there an hour or two hours
before everybody that he would show up

2909
02:20:53,251 --> 02:20:56,760
at these practices.
Everybody would be at breakfast and he

2910
02:20:56,761 --> 02:21:00,600
would show up with ice on his knees and
he was fully sweated out.

2911
02:21:00,601 --> 02:21:03,990
Like he just done three hours of work
and out before anybody did anything.

2912
02:21:04,620 --> 02:21:06,480
There's,
there's people like that man,

2913
02:21:06,630 --> 02:21:09,150
and you can hate on them.
You can hate on them.

2914
02:21:09,151 --> 02:21:12,210
You could decide that this not worth it,
but you got to,

2915
02:21:12,390 --> 02:21:16,020
the best thing you can do is acknowledge
that they're doing something that makes

2916
02:21:16,021 --> 02:21:17,570
you feel funny.
Yep.

2917
02:21:17,610 --> 02:21:21,780
And that makes you feel funny,
is your sense of understanding who you

2918
02:21:21,781 --> 02:21:23,040
are.
It's testing,

2919
02:21:23,300 --> 02:21:27,270
testing how you feel about yourself.
It's testing how you feel about your

2920
02:21:27,271 --> 02:21:30,480
place in the universe is testing it.
You don't want to know that there's some

2921
02:21:30,481 --> 02:21:33,540
crazy Koby Bryant motherfucker getting
up at four in the morning,

2922
02:21:33,870 --> 02:21:36,090
you know,
doing dead lifts like Shit,

2923
02:21:36,720 --> 02:21:40,500
I want to sleep,
but I also want to be number one bro.

2924
02:21:41,670 --> 02:21:44,040
Yup.
Former Lakers player and head coach

2925
02:21:44,130 --> 02:21:49,130
Byron Scott said he wants found an 18
year old bryant shooting in a dark gm

2926
02:21:49,321 --> 02:21:52,200
two hours before practice.
I used to do that,

2927
02:21:52,280 --> 02:21:55,590
but it's throwing footballs,
throwing footballs into a,

2928
02:21:56,310 --> 02:21:58,320
it was actually into the laundry
baskets.

2929
02:21:58,350 --> 02:21:59,820
It's not uncommon,
man.

2930
02:21:59,850 --> 02:22:02,870
It's not uncommon if you,
if you really want to agreed.

2931
02:22:03,080 --> 02:22:04,040
I mean,
you know,

2932
02:22:04,520 --> 02:22:08,480
my sleeping hours are super,
super regular.

2933
02:22:09,050 --> 02:22:12,230
There's times where I feel like
practicing or a lot of times you'll

2934
02:22:12,231 --> 02:22:16,400
probably get up in the morning and I've
already built your bow and I built a

2935
02:22:16,580 --> 02:22:21,580
four or five in the morning because two
people that are the exceptional among

2936
02:22:22,821 --> 02:22:26,370
their field,
they can't sleep if they know that they

2937
02:22:26,371 --> 02:22:28,470
have to do something.
What is,

2938
02:22:28,471 --> 02:22:30,720
what are we looking at something because
as you guys are talking about this,

2939
02:22:30,721 --> 02:22:33,050
he just tore his Achilles.
This is probably one of those last

2940
02:22:33,060 --> 02:22:35,340
things he did.
He tore his Achilles led in order.

2941
02:22:35,580 --> 02:22:37,230
This is like a rule in the game.
He had to shoot.

2942
02:22:37,231 --> 02:22:40,500
His free throws is,
it's a weird stipulation.

2943
02:22:40,501 --> 02:22:44,310
So he's walking back out with no
Achilles and he did does this.

2944
02:22:44,340 --> 02:22:45,530
It was pretty,
pretty impressive.

2945
02:22:46,140 --> 02:22:49,680
Barely walk man.
Holy Shit.

2946
02:22:50,130 --> 02:22:51,240
No crying or nothing.

2947
02:22:52,130 --> 02:22:53,520
But yeah,
it's really fucked up.

2948
02:22:53,820 --> 02:22:55,890
That's how you have to be.
If you want to be a winner,

2949
02:22:55,950 --> 02:22:57,420
there's just no way around it.
You know,

2950
02:22:57,421 --> 02:23:00,360
Swish hollow.
That's why I get the money.

2951
02:23:01,130 --> 02:23:06,130
Look at my mansion at that point.
It's just subconscious taken over.

2952
02:23:07,110 --> 02:23:10,710
Anybody that doesn't think that someone
like coby Bryant doesn't deserve mansion

2953
02:23:11,280 --> 02:23:14,520
and all the money has just done,
does not understand what he just did.

2954
02:23:14,700 --> 02:23:18,330
Two swishes in a row with no Achilles.
Just shut the fuck up.

2955
02:23:18,331 --> 02:23:20,340
I don't know shit about basketball.
I know.

2956
02:23:20,341 --> 02:23:22,470
That was amazing.
I've been pretty,

2957
02:23:23,370 --> 02:23:27,990
I've actually been pretty stuck on this
subject in the last few weeks.

2958
02:23:28,140 --> 02:23:32,520
Um,
I hardly ever,

2959
02:23:32,610 --> 02:23:35,400
ever,
ever look at negativity.

2960
02:23:35,670 --> 02:23:37,950
I mean,
I really don't read it,

2961
02:23:37,951 --> 02:23:39,060
don't look at it.
But,

2962
02:23:39,450 --> 02:23:41,850
um,
there was a really big archery

2963
02:23:41,851 --> 02:23:43,090
tournament,
uh,

2964
02:23:43,210 --> 02:23:48,210
about a month ago and there were some
other pros that had made some comments

2965
02:23:48,961 --> 02:23:50,790
about me just saying,
you know,

2966
02:23:51,570 --> 02:23:55,890
how has John Dudley on a gre podcasts,
he's not even competing,

2967
02:23:55,891 --> 02:24:00,380
he's not doing anything.
And you know,

2968
02:24:00,381 --> 02:24:02,690
people wanted to know how I felt about
that.

2969
02:24:02,691 --> 02:24:07,691
And I said,
the reality is there's several archer's

2970
02:24:07,761 --> 02:24:10,250
out there that have 10 times the talent
in me.

2971
02:24:10,490 --> 02:24:12,890
No question.
I'm not saying that I have that,

2972
02:24:15,010 --> 02:24:20,010
but what really is shitty about that
situation is when someone has 10 times

2973
02:24:20,070 --> 02:24:22,840
more talent in me and they do a 10th as
much,

2974
02:24:24,660 --> 02:24:28,110
to me that's a big problem.
So you think there's a lot of people out

2975
02:24:28,111 --> 02:24:31,110
there that are not realizing their full
potential.

2976
02:24:31,111 --> 02:24:33,750
So because of that,
they're critical of other people because

2977
02:24:33,751 --> 02:24:35,930
maybe even they're looking at their own
self and they,

2978
02:24:36,150 --> 02:24:38,040
they feel like they're not,
I don't know.

2979
02:24:38,880 --> 02:24:41,850
I think,
I think they're looking at the problem

2980
02:24:41,851 --> 02:24:43,650
is because the people do do that,
right?

2981
02:24:43,651 --> 02:24:45,060
Yeah,
absolutely.

2982
02:24:45,570 --> 02:24:50,570
You limit yourself when you are not
looking at what you're doing,

2983
02:24:51,690 --> 02:24:54,720
when you're so occupied on what someone
else is doing,

2984
02:24:55,320 --> 02:24:58,800
you limit what your true talent is.
So is that my problem?

2985
02:24:59,400 --> 02:25:02,910
Is it my problem that you have 10 times
the talent in me,

2986
02:25:03,300 --> 02:25:06,120
but I'm doing 10 times more with it?
Is that,

2987
02:25:06,300 --> 02:25:09,270
is that my problem as a big numbers?
Okay,

2988
02:25:09,271 --> 02:25:11,220
let's say two times.
Okay.

2989
02:25:11,670 --> 02:25:12,503
Okay.
Let's say,

2990
02:25:13,140 --> 02:25:17,670
let's say you have twice a town
naturally have more,

2991
02:25:17,730 --> 02:25:19,200
but you're doing less,
right?

2992
02:25:19,530 --> 02:25:20,230
Yeah.
I know what you're saying.

2993
02:25:20,230 --> 02:25:22,600
I just feel like there's a lot of people
doing that,

2994
02:25:22,610 --> 02:25:23,560
but yeah,
there's,

2995
02:25:23,650 --> 02:25:26,230
I think,
I actually think the majority,

2996
02:25:26,320 --> 02:25:31,320
I think the people that are standouts
are people that don't have the natural,

2997
02:25:33,460 --> 02:25:37,690
true talent.
I think Jon Jones is a perfect example.

2998
02:25:38,260 --> 02:25:43,260
If he was able to literally 100%
maximizes talent,

2999
02:25:43,961 --> 02:25:48,961
how good could he be?
The problem is he's the one that has 10

3000
02:25:49,061 --> 02:25:53,380
times the talent,
but he's screwing it up and there's guys

3001
02:25:53,381 --> 02:25:58,381
that have half the talent that are
bigger stars because they're actually

3002
02:25:58,570 --> 02:26:01,900
doing it the right way and they're
maximize.

3003
02:26:01,990 --> 02:26:05,200
They're almost,
they're almost doubling their potential

3004
02:26:05,201 --> 02:26:10,201
because they're working at it in the
right fashion versus someone that has

3005
02:26:11,440 --> 02:26:15,010
the true talent isn't really maximizing
their talent.

3006
02:26:15,790 --> 02:26:17,400
Hmm.
I know he's saying,

3007
02:26:17,550 --> 02:26:20,220
yeah,
but I think here's a good sign.

3008
02:26:20,550 --> 02:26:23,160
He's a really good sign.
This is an easy way to decipher it.

3009
02:26:23,700 --> 02:26:26,550
When you see someone complaining about
someone else's success,

3010
02:26:28,380 --> 02:26:31,470
anytime you see that,
anytime you see someone complaining

3011
02:26:31,740 --> 02:26:36,570
about someone else's success and
possibly equate again to like some

3012
02:26:36,571 --> 02:26:39,090
injustice in the world because they
don't have equal success,

3013
02:26:40,080 --> 02:26:43,260
the person's making a mistake.
They're making mistake and even the way

3014
02:26:43,261 --> 02:26:45,480
they're thinking,
if you criticize something because you

3015
02:26:45,481 --> 02:26:48,150
just think it's bad,
well that's certainly your prerogative,

3016
02:26:48,440 --> 02:26:49,300
right?
I mean if you just,

3017
02:26:49,390 --> 02:26:51,210
if it's,
especially if it's an art form or if

3018
02:26:51,211 --> 02:26:54,540
it's something someone created,
that's one thing,

3019
02:26:54,990 --> 02:26:57,870
but if you're upset that someone
success,

3020
02:26:58,230 --> 02:27:00,420
that doesn't make any sense.
Well,

3021
02:27:00,600 --> 02:27:03,690
they want it to be successful.
They did the thing that it took to be

3022
02:27:03,691 --> 02:27:05,730
successful.
They became successful.

3023
02:27:05,850 --> 02:27:07,440
And what's your point?

3024
02:27:07,800 --> 02:27:10,350
You don't have a point.
Your point is born a mood.

3025
02:27:10,470 --> 02:27:13,020
It's the little little kids version of
would me,

3026
02:27:13,080 --> 02:27:14,370
what about me?
Well,

3027
02:27:14,430 --> 02:27:15,750
I,
it's not fair.

3028
02:27:15,840 --> 02:27:18,390
It's not fair that some people are born
billionaires.

3029
02:27:18,450 --> 02:27:21,180
It's not fair.
It's not fair that some people are born

3030
02:27:21,181 --> 02:27:23,280
with birth defects where they don't have
feet.

3031
02:27:23,310 --> 02:27:25,170
It's not fair that some people,
their their,

3032
02:27:25,180 --> 02:27:27,720
their fucking brain doesn't work as well
as yours.

3033
02:27:27,721 --> 02:27:29,020
There's a lot of shit.
It's not fair.

3034
02:27:29,620 --> 02:27:31,620
Look at what you got.
Look at what you got.

3035
02:27:31,770 --> 02:27:35,790
You're doing well and you're worried
about someone else's doing better.

3036
02:27:35,850 --> 02:27:38,790
Why not just look at them?
Why not just look at them and go,

3037
02:27:38,791 --> 02:27:40,080
well,
what does that guy do in different,

3038
02:27:40,081 --> 02:27:43,320
what is she doing different than me?
How come she's so much more successful?

3039
02:27:43,470 --> 02:27:46,380
How did he figure out how to do that and
look at it that way?

3040
02:27:46,380 --> 02:27:48,240
Don't look at it like you're angry at
those people.

3041
02:27:48,241 --> 02:27:51,120
That shit is wasted.
It doesn't do you any good.

3042
02:27:51,150 --> 02:27:53,940
It does zero good for anybody involved.
Not You,

3043
02:27:53,941 --> 02:27:55,140
not the person,
your person.

3044
02:27:55,141 --> 02:27:57,970
You're trying to figure out why that was
fucking good.

3045
02:27:57,980 --> 02:27:59,760
Good.
That shit is just bad for you.

3046
02:27:59,820 --> 02:28:02,550
It's bad for everybody.
It's bad for the person thinking

3047
02:28:02,551 --> 02:28:05,340
negatively.
It's bad for everybody around them.

3048
02:28:05,790 --> 02:28:07,440
The best way to do is like,
Huh?

3049
02:28:08,180 --> 02:28:09,960
Like even if you not even hateful about
it,

3050
02:28:09,961 --> 02:28:11,760
like,
like here's a good example.

3051
02:28:11,880 --> 02:28:14,430
Like if a movie is fucking giant in the
box office,

3052
02:28:14,431 --> 02:28:15,264
you're like,
wow,

3053
02:28:15,750 --> 02:28:19,050
I thought it sucked.
I didn't like it or whatever.

3054
02:28:19,500 --> 02:28:22,670
But if you freak out hose full move with
Jumanji

3055
02:28:23,030 --> 02:28:24,380
fucked shit.
Me Bro.

3056
02:28:24,470 --> 02:28:28,190
Jumanji that fucking piece of shit in
our people get crazy.

3057
02:28:28,191 --> 02:28:33,191
They get crazy that I made $800 million
for fucking Jumanji can't.

3058
02:28:34,220 --> 02:28:36,440
It's not good for you man.
You gotta to let that go.

3059
02:28:36,910 --> 02:28:39,470
Don't worry about Jumanji worry about
yourself.

3060
02:28:39,670 --> 02:28:43,990
She [inaudible] it's pretty good.
It's hard twice kids,

3061
02:28:44,000 --> 02:28:45,650
man.
I haven't seen it yet.

3062
02:28:45,651 --> 02:28:47,570
It's pretty good.
I thought it was very good.

3063
02:28:48,330 --> 02:28:51,470
It's really well done.
It's Kevin Hart and the rock together.

3064
02:28:51,471 --> 02:28:54,950
You can't mess Jack Black and one of the
best performances and years and whoever

3065
02:28:54,951 --> 02:28:58,950
was the hot redhead check.
She was great too though.

3066
02:28:59,210 --> 02:29:02,180
I think Jack Black was getting shame.
He's got one of those Farrah Fawcett

3067
02:29:02,181 --> 02:29:04,220
poster is going to check.
I just look something up weird.

3068
02:29:04,221 --> 02:29:05,570
It's not,
it's sort of related.

3069
02:29:05,571 --> 02:29:07,910
The Jurassic world.
Did you see that movie when it came out

3070
02:29:07,911 --> 02:29:09,060
a couple of years ago?
Yeah.

3071
02:29:09,120 --> 02:29:11,480
It's the number three all time grossing.

3072
02:29:11,480 --> 02:29:12,800
Thank God.
Thank God.

3073
02:29:12,801 --> 02:29:14,300
Are you kidding me?
Hey,

3074
02:29:14,301 --> 02:29:16,370
fuck the godfather.
Chris Pratt.

3075
02:29:16,520 --> 02:29:19,730
If you want archery lessons,
legitimately does.

3076
02:29:19,790 --> 02:29:21,890
I bet he does legitimate.
You know,

3077
02:29:21,891 --> 02:29:25,940
did you see that an instagram post that
he put up of is a sheep or a lamb that

3078
02:29:25,941 --> 02:29:29,990
he killed?
He had a pet lamb put a bolt to its head

3079
02:29:29,991 --> 02:29:32,910
and you know,
and chopped it all up and people freak

3080
02:29:32,911 --> 02:29:34,680
the fuck out though.
Like this is our food.

3081
02:29:35,310 --> 02:29:36,260
He didn't see it.
Dude.

3082
02:29:36,261 --> 02:29:37,670
Chris Pratt,
Scott some balls.

3083
02:29:38,240 --> 02:29:41,660
I saw him post a picture of a rub in on
a tree.

3084
02:29:41,750 --> 02:29:42,890
Oh,
he hunts and he said,

3085
02:29:42,891 --> 02:29:45,020
uh,
said something about trolls.

3086
02:29:45,540 --> 02:29:46,231
Yo,
what's up Chris?

3087
02:29:46,231 --> 02:29:48,290
Right here.
Now the 2018.

3088
02:29:49,520 --> 02:29:53,030
What's that?
This is like a rap rapping that sounded

3089
02:29:53,031 --> 02:29:54,680
like this.
The new album.

3090
02:29:55,510 --> 02:29:56,480
No.
Pratt rap.

3091
02:29:56,510 --> 02:29:58,550
He um,
he does though.

3092
02:29:58,620 --> 02:29:59,550
Go is,
uh,

3093
02:30:00,440 --> 02:30:04,640
that's not it.
There's a video where he shows the lamb

3094
02:30:04,820 --> 02:30:09,820
that he's actually taken apart.
This is the snow in the video.

3095
02:30:10,341 --> 02:30:12,670
It says it.
Okay.

3096
02:30:13,780 --> 02:30:14,613
When I ate it all.

3097
02:30:17,270 --> 02:30:18,370
Well,
no.

3098
02:30:18,870 --> 02:30:21,620
What I meant is there photographs.
She's actually photographs of the

3099
02:30:21,621 --> 02:30:24,950
butchered lamb and people lost their
fucking Shit,

3100
02:30:24,951 --> 02:30:25,611
man.
That's,

3101
02:30:25,611 --> 02:30:26,650
that's not it.
It's um,

3102
02:30:27,080 --> 02:30:30,740
there's actually like photographs of the
meat and like there's a roast in the

3103
02:30:30,741 --> 02:30:31,610
roast is there.
It is,

3104
02:30:31,611 --> 02:30:32,630
right.
The one in the middle.

3105
02:30:32,650 --> 02:30:34,940
Yeah.
And this one gets a legitimate,

3106
02:30:35,600 --> 02:30:40,370
I don't know if that's necessarily land.
They came from his,

3107
02:30:40,371 --> 02:30:44,150
I'm assuming it honestly sounds like it
says,

3108
02:30:44,151 --> 02:30:48,440
look at all this glorious food.
We will eat off him for a month.

3109
02:30:48,570 --> 02:30:51,800
His wools becoming yarn as we speak.
He lived a very good life.

3110
02:30:51,890 --> 02:30:55,400
He was groomed and shorn.
His hooves medicated.

3111
02:30:55,910 --> 02:30:58,670
Why he wormed and no antibiotics
necessary.

3112
02:30:58,671 --> 02:31:01,130
Surrounded by laughing and loving
humans,

3113
02:31:01,131 --> 02:31:04,490
including children to whom they provided
such joy nozzle,

3114
02:31:04,520 --> 02:31:07,820
pat and loved every day.
No stressful travel to his final

3115
02:31:07,821 --> 02:31:11,930
destination.
Trauma free just to touch of a u s d a

3116
02:31:11,931 --> 02:31:15,980
certified wan to his head and he goes to
sleep.

3117
02:31:16,640 --> 02:31:20,010
The other sheep don't even notice.
It's unplugging

3118
02:31:20,010 --> 02:31:24,270
your TV.
Then Waka Waka he's got a butcher name.

3119
02:31:24,271 --> 02:31:25,530
Wacom,
Wacom,

3120
02:31:25,531 --> 02:31:30,270
my Bush or Waka Flocka side job then
blankets or wrapper.

3121
02:31:30,770 --> 02:31:33,690
It is definitely,
you're so white walk.

3122
02:31:33,960 --> 02:31:38,960
My butcher were magic.
He's definitely right now the meat is

3123
02:31:39,331 --> 02:31:40,920
for friends,
family and gifts.

3124
02:31:40,950 --> 02:31:45,690
Soon though it may be available to my
followers as we test recipes and opened

3125
02:31:45,691 --> 02:31:46,590
up to market.
Oh my God,

3126
02:31:46,591 --> 02:31:51,210
he's got a murder animals for a living.
I got to get some things dialed in

3127
02:31:51,211 --> 02:31:53,370
first,
including murder,

3128
02:31:54,630 --> 02:31:57,210
murder of sheep.
Just kidding.

3129
02:31:57,390 --> 02:31:58,840
Like he is.
I eat meat,

3130
02:31:59,930 --> 02:32:03,690
but that's a glorious how get the balls
in this guy.

3131
02:32:03,870 --> 02:32:08,610
When has a a list actor ever considered
opening?

3132
02:32:08,611 --> 02:32:12,090
I agree.
A meat shop and showed a photo on his

3133
02:32:12,091 --> 02:32:16,500
instagram of the honest procurement of
meat in an honest way.

3134
02:32:16,640 --> 02:32:19,610
Did you see that post I made today?
No.

3135
02:32:19,690 --> 02:32:20,523
What?
Which one?

3136
02:32:20,550 --> 02:32:22,680
My,
I have my airplane mode on so I can't

3137
02:32:22,681 --> 02:32:23,760
post it.
But I think,

3138
02:32:23,761 --> 02:32:26,070
um,
I made a post,

3139
02:32:26,310 --> 02:32:28,710
uh,
it was a google search that I did.

3140
02:32:30,560 --> 02:32:35,530
There was 21 independent,
um,

3141
02:32:35,660 --> 02:32:40,660
legitimate scientists that found that if
you ate 50 grams of processed meat per

3142
02:32:42,621 --> 02:32:47,000
day,
your chance of cancer was 18% higher.

3143
02:32:47,450 --> 02:32:48,380
Holy Shit.

3144
02:32:50,410 --> 02:32:53,470
Just think of that number now is at
night nitrites.

3145
02:32:53,471 --> 02:32:54,350
What is it?
What are the,

3146
02:32:54,351 --> 02:32:55,700
what are they thinking?
It's causing that.

3147
02:32:56,980 --> 02:33:00,370
Yeah.
That part wasn't clearly defined,

3148
02:33:00,371 --> 02:33:03,520
but I would definitely think it was
preserved based,

3149
02:33:03,610 --> 02:33:04,040
but

3150
02:33:04,040 --> 02:33:05,210
they don't really know though.
Right.

3151
02:33:05,510 --> 02:33:08,150
They know it's processed meat.
It's really dangerous.

3152
02:33:08,420 --> 02:33:10,160
Yeah.
They don't know what it is exactly.

3153
02:33:10,390 --> 02:33:11,223
That's what right.

3154
02:33:11,320 --> 02:33:16,320
Awesome about how you and I hunt.
I posted it specifically to actually

3155
02:33:16,361 --> 02:33:19,960
some access backstraps from Hawaii last
year.

3156
02:33:20,740 --> 02:33:22,900
Um,
because I think,

3157
02:33:23,920 --> 02:33:28,920
I think it's maybe ignorant for people
to automatically make a post saying,

3158
02:33:30,850 --> 02:33:33,820
you know,
you're a killer just because you post a

3159
02:33:33,821 --> 02:33:35,170
picture of,
you know,

3160
02:33:35,171 --> 02:33:38,230
free range,
organic meat that you decided to choose

3161
02:33:38,231 --> 02:33:40,300
a touch.
Um,

3162
02:33:40,740 --> 02:33:42,050
look at it.
I know what you're saying,

3163
02:33:42,051 --> 02:33:43,490
but you got to look at it from their
perspective.

3164
02:33:43,530 --> 02:33:45,260
I do.
Even if they're not right,

3165
02:33:45,740 --> 02:33:49,040
and there's no right here.
The thing is there's there,

3166
02:33:49,041 --> 02:33:50,060
right,
and you're right,

3167
02:33:50,300 --> 02:33:53,210
it's everybody's right.
It's this really what's fucked up about

3168
02:33:53,211 --> 02:33:55,490
it.
Like an animal does have to die.

3169
02:33:55,940 --> 02:33:57,470
You know it.
That is a fact.

3170
02:33:57,620 --> 02:34:01,370
And that does bother people,
including you and me when it happens.

3171
02:34:01,420 --> 02:34:03,740
And people don't realize that.
But that is true.

3172
02:34:03,800 --> 02:34:04,940
They don't.
But the,

3173
02:34:06,380 --> 02:34:10,640
the understanding at the end of the day
is that this is the cycle of life and

3174
02:34:10,641 --> 02:34:13,490
this is what life is really all about.
So they're right in your right,

3175
02:34:13,491 --> 02:34:15,980
but this whole,
this expression of outrage,

3176
02:34:16,040 --> 02:34:17,980
like you should be expressing that at

3177
02:34:17,980 --> 02:34:19,510
Burger King.
You should be,

3178
02:34:19,540 --> 02:34:22,000
and not Burger King,
just,

3179
02:34:22,060 --> 02:34:23,890
you know,
I'm not singling them out.

3180
02:34:23,920 --> 02:34:27,310
Anybody that has fast food,
which I've eaten many times.

3181
02:34:27,380 --> 02:34:29,710
If you want to live in a society of 20
million people,

3182
02:34:29,860 --> 02:34:33,430
you're going to have to live in a place
most likely with this model where you've

3183
02:34:33,431 --> 02:34:35,860
got in and out Burger.
And I like in and out Burger.

3184
02:34:35,890 --> 02:34:37,030
I like them.
They taste good,

3185
02:34:37,150 --> 02:34:38,650
but go ahead.
We went there in Vegas,

3186
02:34:38,920 --> 02:34:40,060
they've got damn good,
right?

3187
02:34:40,510 --> 02:34:44,170
It's hard to beat,
so I don't necessarily hate those

3188
02:34:44,171 --> 02:34:46,840
things,
but you have to understand what all this

3189
02:34:46,841 --> 02:34:48,460
really is.
You know?

3190
02:34:48,490 --> 02:34:52,360
It's the whole thing is crazy.
You're here for a very short period of

3191
02:34:52,361 --> 02:34:53,800
time,
as are these animals.

3192
02:34:53,980 --> 02:34:56,740
All of us are trying to stay alive.
All of us are freaking out.

3193
02:34:56,741 --> 02:34:59,380
One of the things get eaten and we're
all just going like,

3194
02:34:59,530 --> 02:35:01,360
well,
I just want to be the best version of

3195
02:35:01,361 --> 02:35:01,600
me.

3196
02:35:01,600 --> 02:35:04,360
I can be your right hand there,
right?

3197
02:35:04,780 --> 02:35:08,050
They just,
they haven't experienced what they,

3198
02:35:08,110 --> 02:35:10,690
they have decided that an animal should
not die.

3199
02:35:11,170 --> 02:35:13,480
There's no way an animal should die so
that they can live,

3200
02:35:13,481 --> 02:35:15,850
and if they can live that way,
that's their choice.

3201
02:35:16,090 --> 02:35:20,020
They're welcome to that choice.
They just don't understand the merit of

3202
02:35:20,021 --> 02:35:23,740
your choice.
The merit of your choice is just

3203
02:35:23,741 --> 02:35:27,910
diametrically opposed to what they think
should be and should not be a thing a

3204
02:35:27,911 --> 02:35:30,190
person does.
You shouldn't be a person that kills

3205
02:35:30,191 --> 02:35:33,170
animals,
but when you're engulfed in that world,

3206
02:35:33,171 --> 02:35:34,750
when you're living in the woods,
when you're,

3207
02:35:34,810 --> 02:35:37,630
when you're going through these seven,
eight,

3208
02:35:37,631 --> 02:35:38,560
nine,
10 day hunts,

3209
02:35:38,561 --> 02:35:42,040
you give us understanding of what this
world around these things.

3210
02:35:42,041 --> 02:35:44,470
It really is.
It's this crazy,

3211
02:35:44,471 --> 02:35:48,250
beautiful,
complex interaction between Predator and

3212
02:35:48,251 --> 02:35:50,650
prey and it's been going on since life
was here.

3213
02:35:50,720 --> 02:35:53,050
Yeah.
Just what it is and what you're doing as

3214
02:35:53,051 --> 02:35:57,550
a hunter is just figuring out with your
soft bitch ass skin and you're,

3215
02:35:57,551 --> 02:36:02,551
you're fucking shaky knees,
bad ankles weasely yourself into a

3216
02:36:02,561 --> 02:36:07,090
position where you can jump into the
food chain with wolves around that

3217
02:36:07,120 --> 02:36:09,880
fucking conversation that we had about
wolves.

3218
02:36:10,060 --> 02:36:14,230
Did that change people's understanding
of what a wolf is when on the first time

3219
02:36:14,231 --> 02:36:16,150
you came on the podcast,
you talked about how the wolves to try

3220
02:36:16,151 --> 02:36:16,720
and take your

3221
02:36:16,720 --> 02:36:19,010
away from you too.
That's a crazy story.

3222
02:36:19,420 --> 02:36:20,360
Yeah.
I mean,

3223
02:36:20,361 --> 02:36:22,490
there are my all time favorite stories.
Yeah.

3224
02:36:22,491 --> 02:36:24,230
There at camp,
I mean,

3225
02:36:25,700 --> 02:36:27,980
there's an interaction going on Predator
and prey.

3226
02:36:28,340 --> 02:36:29,950
This is happening.
Your name.

3227
02:36:31,160 --> 02:36:34,190
It's not like it's established and it's
written in stone.

3228
02:36:35,060 --> 02:36:39,950
Every level of the food chain is being
competitive with the next.

3229
02:36:39,980 --> 02:36:42,980
Yeah.
It's not like it is a very clear cut

3230
02:36:43,010 --> 02:36:46,670
concrete step to where every step is
clear.

3231
02:36:47,120 --> 02:36:49,490
Humans are here,
wolves are here,

3232
02:36:49,550 --> 02:36:52,580
grizzlies are here,
access deer here.

3233
02:36:52,610 --> 02:36:55,490
Turkeys are here and I would,
I would inject one other thing.

3234
02:36:55,550 --> 02:36:58,330
Cwd Yup.
Chronic wasting diseases.

3235
02:36:58,340 --> 02:37:01,280
Kill study biology comes into this
thing.

3236
02:37:02,210 --> 02:37:02,920
Diseases is

3237
02:37:02,920 --> 02:37:07,120
are creeping in and killing deer left
and right and a lot of people feel like

3238
02:37:07,121 --> 02:37:10,390
these diseases were created by people
farming those deal.

3239
02:37:10,640 --> 02:37:15,640
It was dear taking them out of the wild
environments and letting them like eat

3240
02:37:15,801 --> 02:37:16,020
off

3241
02:37:16,020 --> 02:37:20,720
the same food and constantly exchange
bacteria with each other and that's what

3242
02:37:20,721 --> 02:37:21,554
created this thing.

3243
02:37:21,810 --> 02:37:24,540
I've,
I've told people metro times that I feel

3244
02:37:24,541 --> 02:37:29,541
like mother nature is a form of Karma.
I think Mother Nature will take care of

3245
02:37:31,531 --> 02:37:36,531
herself.
I think as things below that level,

3246
02:37:37,260 --> 02:37:42,260
try to occupy their own status.
I think that's the balance.

3247
02:37:42,721 --> 02:37:46,500
That's a check that's in process.
I think Mother Nature,

3248
02:37:46,501 --> 02:37:50,160
naturally,
I think if you decide I'm not going to

3249
02:37:50,161 --> 02:37:53,190
shoot any turkeys,
I'm going to just let these turkeys go

3250
02:37:53,360 --> 02:37:56,850
as wild as they can.
I think all sudden mother nature comes

3251
02:37:56,851 --> 02:37:58,440
in and says,
uh,

3252
02:37:58,800 --> 02:38:02,310
I'm going to throw a little trump card
in here called black heads disease.

3253
02:38:03,170 --> 02:38:07,830
This is going to kill every freaking
Turkey in your area and I'm going to

3254
02:38:07,831 --> 02:38:09,000
regulate this

3255
02:38:09,370 --> 02:38:11,590
according fasting.
Does that always happens?

3256
02:38:11,860 --> 02:38:13,540
Yeah.
When animals get over it and that's one

3257
02:38:13,541 --> 02:38:15,900
of the things and it's being concerned
about Hawaii,

3258
02:38:15,930 --> 02:38:16,210
right?

3259
02:38:16,210 --> 02:38:17,700
Disease.
Yup.

3260
02:38:17,950 --> 02:38:22,950
And then you look at a white tail and
areas where maybe there's been,

3261
02:38:23,650 --> 02:38:26,290
you know,
I guess quote Unquote Trophy Hunters to

3262
02:38:26,291 --> 02:38:29,740
where they've not really,
um,

3263
02:38:31,870 --> 02:38:36,790
I guess regulated the population of
Whitetail deer to point where,

3264
02:38:36,810 --> 02:38:38,980
you know,
they're trying to grow trophy hunting.

3265
02:38:39,430 --> 02:38:42,920
So to me to try and grow a deer with
large animals,

3266
02:38:42,950 --> 02:38:46,060
larger antlers.
So there may be shooting less numbers

3267
02:38:46,120 --> 02:38:50,050
and then all of a sudden here comes this
little thing called Ehd,

3268
02:38:50,080 --> 02:38:53,230
which kills every whitetail.
It goes to drink water.

3269
02:38:53,800 --> 02:38:56,720
I don't know it,
it is chronic wasting disease.

3270
02:38:56,780 --> 02:39:01,210
EAC is different.
It's an image that actually lives in the

3271
02:39:01,211 --> 02:39:04,690
mud.
I'm on the receiving water line on a

3272
02:39:04,691 --> 02:39:06,300
pond.
So as a,

3273
02:39:06,700 --> 02:39:09,370
you know,
as a whitetail deer would go into

3274
02:39:09,400 --> 02:39:11,800
actually drink,
uh,

3275
02:39:11,830 --> 02:39:16,830
this mitch fly lives in the,
in the soil on the re the receding

3276
02:39:17,580 --> 02:39:21,070
waterline,
and it would go into the nostril of the

3277
02:39:21,071 --> 02:39:25,420
deer and then literally within 48 hours,
that deer's debt,

3278
02:39:25,930 --> 02:39:27,520
if it,
if it gets that,

3279
02:39:27,790 --> 02:39:29,770
that virus,
look at the name of it.

3280
02:39:30,250 --> 02:39:34,740
Epic Zoo,
epizootic hemorrhagic disease and you

3281
02:39:34,741 --> 02:39:37,060
know,
so it's like an ebola type disease.

3282
02:39:37,061 --> 02:39:40,930
I think a bowl is that Ebola hemalogic
disease.

3283
02:39:41,850 --> 02:39:43,680
Not,
didn't have to pee so hard.

3284
02:39:43,780 --> 02:39:45,610
Me Too.
I've never had a pee more of my life.

3285
02:39:46,090 --> 02:39:47,780
This is awesome.
We've had a,

3286
02:39:47,900 --> 02:39:50,570
I did I pee before the trial.
There's a different suit.

3287
02:39:50,580 --> 02:39:52,210
Wolves and coyotes.
I saw that picture.

3288
02:39:52,211 --> 02:39:55,210
It's an amazing picture.
Somebody's got to picture between this

3289
02:39:55,240 --> 02:40:00,240
majestic black wolf with fucking white
glowing eyes that both looks amazing.

3290
02:40:01,160 --> 02:40:05,050
Like I'm out to coyote is like,
fuck all this.

3291
02:40:05,580 --> 02:40:07,360
We've got to get away from that thing,
man,

3292
02:40:07,390 --> 02:40:10,930
that is so heavy.
Go from Ehd to two coyotes running from

3293
02:40:10,931 --> 02:40:12,880
a black wool.
How do we concentrate on the,

3294
02:40:13,260 --> 02:40:14,050
what's that set

3295
02:40:14,050 --> 02:40:14,970
it up.
Um,

3296
02:40:15,000 --> 02:40:16,890
did you think you guys could talk for a
few minutes?

3297
02:40:16,891 --> 02:40:18,270
Where Ip,
go for it.

3298
02:40:19,080 --> 02:40:19,920
Keep it together.
Yeah.

3299
02:40:19,950 --> 02:40:22,590
Talk about sports.
Sports.

3300
02:40:23,430 --> 02:40:24,270
All right,
Jamie.

3301
02:40:26,010 --> 02:40:26,431
Well,
yeah,

3302
02:40:26,431 --> 02:40:30,300
I mean is this is the first official
podcast where Rogan's had to actually

3303
02:40:30,670 --> 02:40:33,030
maybe like the second or third time and
a second time?

3304
02:40:34,200 --> 02:40:37,250
Yes.
It's dumped back on podcast.

3305
02:40:37,251 --> 02:40:38,084
The flex that,

3306
02:40:38,480 --> 02:40:40,280
yep.
Uh,

3307
02:40:40,670 --> 02:40:41,900
no,
this is pretty,

3308
02:40:41,960 --> 02:40:45,710
pretty epic right here to make Rogan
actually go.

3309
02:40:45,830 --> 02:40:48,650
That means he's consumed more than he's
talked.

3310
02:40:48,680 --> 02:40:51,320
That's pretty powerful.
That happens from time to time.

3311
02:40:51,560 --> 02:40:54,050
I know.
I like that sweatshirt.

3312
02:40:54,051 --> 02:40:58,160
Jamie's actually told me earlier,
he's trying to make a profession out of

3313
02:40:58,310 --> 02:41:01,260
video gaming,
which I would know about refreshing,

3314
02:41:01,310 --> 02:41:03,740
but a,
I stream from time to time on twitch,

3315
02:41:03,770 --> 02:41:07,580
which is an interesting thing that you
said your son does it a little bit or he

3316
02:41:07,581 --> 02:41:08,600
looks at it.
Yeah.

3317
02:41:09,020 --> 02:41:10,580
Well,
I used to play quite a bit.

3318
02:41:10,830 --> 02:41:11,600
Our,
uh,

3319
02:41:11,600 --> 02:41:16,280
we had two accounts.
One was death by Dudley on playstation.

3320
02:41:16,760 --> 02:41:17,570
And,
uh,

3321
02:41:17,570 --> 02:41:19,820
the other one was bald,
hairless Yeti.

3322
02:41:21,340 --> 02:41:23,870
He playing with them like you guys play
at times?

3323
02:41:23,871 --> 02:41:24,681
We did.
Yeah.

3324
02:41:24,681 --> 02:41:27,600
We were big modern warfare guys.
Um,

3325
02:41:27,620 --> 02:41:30,890
we really liked that and actually I met,
um,

3326
02:41:31,400 --> 02:41:35,420
I met several cool dudes during that,
during that,

3327
02:41:35,421 --> 02:41:37,040
uh,
online play.

3328
02:41:37,820 --> 02:41:38,810
I always,
you know,

3329
02:41:38,840 --> 02:41:43,840
honestly I felt like if I was a
competitive archer and I would have been

3330
02:41:45,860 --> 02:41:50,860
online prior to my competition,
I feel like I almost could have helped

3331
02:41:51,950 --> 02:41:56,950
some of my performance anxiety when it
comes to competition because there's so

3332
02:41:58,071 --> 02:42:02,180
many.
You get so like into beating the guy

3333
02:42:02,181 --> 02:42:06,890
that you're going against that it's,
you can almost freak out and you don't

3334
02:42:06,891 --> 02:42:10,820
do things according to a systematic
method,

3335
02:42:10,850 --> 02:42:15,850
which is really all a video game is,
is it's if you follow the systematic

3336
02:42:16,581 --> 02:42:19,910
method,
you can overcome the alley algorithm.

3337
02:42:19,911 --> 02:42:20,744
Right.
For sure.

3338
02:42:21,150 --> 02:42:22,470
Um,
but

3339
02:42:26,170 --> 02:42:28,680
here it goes.
That was rough.

3340
02:42:28,730 --> 02:42:30,280
How was full of those?
Um,

3341
02:42:31,110 --> 02:42:32,250
I got to go now.
Do you,

3342
02:42:32,251 --> 02:42:33,470
go ahead.
Go ahead norris.

3343
02:42:33,640 --> 02:42:35,580
What are you going to talk about?
Whatever you talked about.

3344
02:42:35,990 --> 02:42:38,350
I'm going to,
let's,

3345
02:42:39,130 --> 02:42:41,880
let's hear this so hard.
That was crazy.

3346
02:42:41,881 --> 02:42:46,140
I was talking about her.
I talked about my two online video

3347
02:42:46,141 --> 02:42:48,780
gaming accounts with,
with my little dude,

3348
02:42:48,781 --> 02:42:52,980
Harry.
One was death by Dudley and the other

3349
02:42:52,981 --> 02:42:54,060
one was bald.
Hairless.

3350
02:42:54,061 --> 02:42:54,720
She,
Eddie,

3351
02:42:54,720 --> 02:42:58,890
what do you play?
Mainly a modern warfare stuff.

3352
02:42:59,040 --> 02:43:01,890
Oh yeah.
Anything that you kill someone.

3353
02:43:02,490 --> 02:43:06,480
Sadly enough.
Go get you your and on me and I'm young.

3354
02:43:06,481 --> 02:43:08,280
Jane will talk about the implications to
that.

3355
02:43:08,281 --> 02:43:10,020
Let's hear about this.
What is this?

3356
02:43:10,650 --> 02:43:13,780
What is it about these?
I have three coffees.

3357
02:43:13,870 --> 02:43:15,550
That's not good.
That's a lot of caffeine.

3358
02:43:15,760 --> 02:43:17,260
Thank God you've got that whiskey.
That's dumb.

3359
02:43:17,261 --> 02:43:20,260
It down balances.
Perfect.

3360
02:43:20,261 --> 02:43:21,460
You'd be talking to how to control

3361
02:43:24,590 --> 02:43:28,020
it was one of the drunk or podcasts.
One of them.

3362
02:43:28,200 --> 02:43:31,320
Right,
but there's something fun about getting

3363
02:43:31,321 --> 02:43:34,620
together with a really good friend.
Just getting lit up.

3364
02:43:34,770 --> 02:43:37,170
Smoke a little weed,
drink a little whiskey.

3365
02:43:37,320 --> 02:43:39,870
It's have a good time.
Just have a good time.

3366
02:43:39,900 --> 02:43:43,020
Today's been a good time.
That guy's a good guy.

3367
02:43:43,620 --> 02:43:45,960
John Dudley's a fucking good man.
I love that guy.

3368
02:43:46,440 --> 02:43:51,440
He's fun and he's also,
I'm a master at something that's very

3369
02:43:51,721 --> 02:43:53,520
difficult to do.
He's a master,

3370
02:43:53,521 --> 02:43:56,850
not just at like executing archery,
but instructing it,

3371
02:43:57,330 --> 02:44:00,750
teaching people.
It's a fascinating thing that archery

3372
02:44:00,751 --> 02:44:04,200
man,
to me it's super important and I think

3373
02:44:04,201 --> 02:44:07,230
that everybody goes to these like things
where like what's important to them,

3374
02:44:07,231 --> 02:44:09,660
like to you might be a guitar amp,
you know,

3375
02:44:09,670 --> 02:44:14,190
might be a certain drums,
a drum sticks.

3376
02:44:14,191 --> 02:44:16,650
It might be whatever the fuck you're
into,

3377
02:44:16,860 --> 02:44:18,390
you know that might be important to you.

3378
02:44:20,070 --> 02:44:24,300
But archery I think is one of those
things that most people miss.

3379
02:44:24,690 --> 02:44:26,220
You just don't get a chance at it.
You're like,

3380
02:44:26,221 --> 02:44:27,090
God,
that looks good.

3381
02:44:27,690 --> 02:44:29,520
That looks like it'd be fun,
but you don't know where to go.

3382
02:44:29,760 --> 02:44:33,060
And you never do it like by far most
people.

3383
02:44:33,990 --> 02:44:35,700
But once you do do it,
you realize like,

3384
02:44:35,760 --> 02:44:38,340
oh,
I can learn about life through this

3385
02:44:38,341 --> 02:44:41,670
weird thing.
I'm pulling that string back and I'm

3386
02:44:41,671 --> 02:44:45,060
launching a pointed stick at a target
and I'm learning about myself.

3387
02:44:45,061 --> 02:44:50,061
Like what I'm learning about how I deal
with situations where I have to execute

3388
02:44:51,361 --> 02:44:55,620
correctly under pressure.
Even if it's just a minor pressure of

3389
02:44:55,621 --> 02:44:58,620
hitting a target or the major pressure
of hitting an animal.

3390
02:44:59,010 --> 02:45:00,240
He learned to that shit.
Jamie,

3391
02:45:01,350 --> 02:45:02,183
what are you showing me?

3392
02:45:02,660 --> 02:45:04,870
There's this game.
I feel like we've,

3393
02:45:05,030 --> 02:45:08,180
I showed this to you awhile ago,
but this is called the hunter call of

3394
02:45:08,181 --> 02:45:11,090
the wild.
Should we tell people archery part of

3395
02:45:11,091 --> 02:45:11,750
it?
Should we tell,

3396
02:45:11,750 --> 02:45:13,740
oh damn.
It's a compound bow it.

3397
02:45:13,760 --> 02:45:14,660
Who's got a real bow?
Yeah.

3398
02:45:14,750 --> 02:45:16,430
Why has he goes sideways like he's
Gangsta?

3399
02:45:16,440 --> 02:45:18,820
I'd probably say you can see,
I bet even once you pull it up to aim,

3400
02:45:18,860 --> 02:45:20,790
he better,
so I'm hoping I can get you better pull

3401
02:45:20,800 --> 02:45:21,890
it back.
Oh yeah.

3402
02:45:21,891 --> 02:45:22,880
He goes,
wow,

3403
02:45:22,881 --> 02:45:25,340
that's legit.
Look at this John Dudley,

3404
02:45:25,341 --> 02:45:27,020
this gundam archery video game

3405
02:45:27,190 --> 02:45:31,300
guys pulling back a bow and looking
through a site like you would like a

3406
02:45:31,301 --> 02:45:33,550
real compound bow site.
That's amazing

3407
02:45:34,450 --> 02:45:37,930
with the whisker biscuit,
powerful whisker biscuit and then you go

3408
02:45:37,931 --> 02:45:39,210
home.
A lot of people still rocket.

3409
02:45:40,270 --> 02:45:42,880
A lot of people still rock the bus
about,

3410
02:45:43,630 --> 02:45:46,300
I wish the biscuit was in fallible.
I wish it was.

3411
02:45:46,301 --> 02:45:48,310
The way to go.
Seems so easy.

3412
02:45:48,670 --> 02:45:50,560
I just hate the name.
Yes.

3413
02:45:50,561 --> 02:45:51,760
Your biscuit.
Yeah.

3414
02:45:51,761 --> 02:45:55,240
I mean I hate it but it's definitely
provocative.

3415
02:45:55,330 --> 02:45:56,590
People don't know what we're talking
about.

3416
02:45:56,591 --> 02:46:00,100
It's the Arrow go.
Some people definitely do.

3417
02:46:00,130 --> 02:46:02,440
Most people don't.
Most people listen to this podcast,

3418
02:46:02,441 --> 02:46:04,690
probably don't.
It's a type of archery rest where that

3419
02:46:04,720 --> 02:46:06,880
Arrow sits.
It's very controversial.

3420
02:46:07,000 --> 02:46:10,100
This is how geeky archery is.
It's very controversial.

3421
02:46:10,101 --> 02:46:14,090
Should you have some fine mesh that's
sort of cradles the Arrow and that

3422
02:46:14,091 --> 02:46:19,091
fledglings will pass through that five
mesh possibly knocking down how many

3423
02:46:19,221 --> 02:46:21,190
feet per second?
Five.

3424
02:46:21,270 --> 02:46:23,910
I'm five feet paws.
Three.

3425
02:46:23,930 --> 02:46:27,740
Five scientific.
I don't do that so we'll be stuck in an

3426
02:46:27,750 --> 02:46:32,480
hour so we'll be real conservative and
say three,

3427
02:46:32,510 --> 02:46:34,790
three feet a second,
which is pretty probably knocks off more

3428
02:46:34,791 --> 02:46:37,040
than that but some people like it
because of its simplicity.

3429
02:46:37,070 --> 02:46:39,930
There it is.
That's a whisker biscuit and the

3430
02:46:39,950 --> 02:46:43,730
fletching is a pass through.
Those fine fibers slow down a little bit

3431
02:46:43,731 --> 02:46:47,210
but not too much.
That's literally like training wheels

3432
02:46:47,211 --> 02:46:52,211
for your Arrow with John Dudley believes
in is like this crazy drop away type

3433
02:46:54,021 --> 02:46:56,300
thing where they have an arrow rest that
drops down.

3434
02:46:56,340 --> 02:46:57,440
He makes his own era.

3435
02:46:57,840 --> 02:47:00,060
Yep.
Knock on Arrow rest.

3436
02:47:00,270 --> 02:47:05,130
[inaudible] it's,
it is the knock on elevates the shit.

3437
02:47:05,500 --> 02:47:06,480
Jason.
It's a,

3438
02:47:06,481 --> 02:47:08,250
it's a subject I want to talk to you
about.

3439
02:47:08,630 --> 02:47:10,920
Never talk to you about this ever.
Oh,

3440
02:47:12,120 --> 02:47:15,450
so no.
A bunch of my u s team members,

3441
02:47:15,451 --> 02:47:19,410
they're going to shoot me in the face
for tough talking about this because in

3442
02:47:19,411 --> 02:47:20,610
the face,
yeah,

3443
02:47:20,730 --> 02:47:25,730
literally in the face because one thing
that was an ongoing thing for when I was

3444
02:47:27,061 --> 02:47:28,810
on the u s team,
we,

3445
02:47:29,490 --> 02:47:33,870
there was this thing that went on about
how long we could go at a tournament

3446
02:47:33,871 --> 02:47:36,990
before we talked about this particular
person.

3447
02:47:38,580 --> 02:47:43,580
So during my time on the teams,
we actually had a person that was,

3448
02:47:45,660 --> 02:47:49,380
um,
she claimed to have a medical disorder

3449
02:47:49,440 --> 02:47:52,860
or she didn't actually claim to have it,
but supposedly it happens.

3450
02:47:53,400 --> 02:47:57,750
But she claimed to have a disorder where
she had attachment to items.

3451
02:47:59,100 --> 02:48:02,910
This girl that was on my team actually
ended up marrying the Eiffel Tower.

3452
02:48:05,210 --> 02:48:06,840
I'm serious.
I'm not kidding.

3453
02:48:07,270 --> 02:48:12,270
She had an attachment to
a love interest that she actually filed

3454
02:48:13,981 --> 02:48:18,981
some claims against.
Supposedly filed some claims against a

3455
02:48:19,151 --> 02:48:24,151
boat company that this boat company
actually had a rubber laminate on the

3456
02:48:25,920 --> 02:48:28,500
limbs of the bow and

3457
02:48:30,160 --> 02:48:33,110
there she is.
Mary's I feel cow.

3458
02:48:33,290 --> 02:48:34,123
Is that her?

3459
02:48:35,050 --> 02:48:38,950
Wow.
She married a Harris is famous monument.

3460
02:48:38,951 --> 02:48:42,210
I wrote a mini buses with,
with her.

3461
02:48:43,330 --> 02:48:44,290
Oh my God.

3462
02:48:45,590 --> 02:48:47,730
A former soldier who lives in San
Francisco.

3463
02:48:47,731 --> 02:48:49,590
She has been in love with the objects
before.

3464
02:48:50,140 --> 02:48:55,140
Her first infatuation was with Lance,
a bow that helped her become a

3465
02:48:55,141 --> 02:48:59,250
worldclass archer.
She is fond of the Berlin Wall and she

3466
02:48:59,251 --> 02:49:03,060
claims to have a physical relationship
with a piece of fence.

3467
02:49:03,061 --> 02:49:05,880
She keeps it a bedroom.
What in the fuck?

3468
02:49:06,390 --> 02:49:07,780
Why I doing?

3469
02:49:08,310 --> 02:49:11,640
What are we doing people,
we can't.

3470
02:49:12,360 --> 02:49:17,360
We can't do this.
We've gotten too crazy.

3471
02:49:17,910 --> 02:49:20,580
We got to pull back.
We got to pull back.

3472
02:49:21,420 --> 02:49:22,840
Here's the thing,
Mary.

3473
02:49:23,040 --> 02:49:25,260
A fucking bridge.
This pitch married a bridge.

3474
02:49:25,710 --> 02:49:28,260
She married a Brooklyn Grit near the
Eiffel Tower.

3475
02:49:28,350 --> 02:49:30,900
This bitch is marrying a bridge though.
Just kissing.

3476
02:49:31,080 --> 02:49:35,310
She's kissing bridges
public object.

3477
02:49:35,850 --> 02:49:40,850
But what the fuck does she just say?
Love of the public object.

3478
02:49:41,610 --> 02:49:44,100
Crank that up.
I want to hear this crazy lady.

3479
02:49:46,260 --> 02:49:49,770
I feel very,
very blessed to have a piece of my sweet

3480
02:49:49,771 --> 02:49:51,230
Golden Gate Bridge.
Oh,

3481
02:49:51,240 --> 02:49:52,860
Jesus stopped.
I give up.

3482
02:49:53,370 --> 02:49:58,370
I'm out.
I hung in there as long as I could with

3483
02:49:59,180 --> 02:50:00,300
the bridge.
Hey

3484
02:50:01,910 --> 02:50:02,700
Dad,

3485
02:50:02,700 --> 02:50:03,850
wait,
wait.

3486
02:50:05,230 --> 02:50:08,290
In the middle of all this,
there's a lot of people like me that

3487
02:50:08,291 --> 02:50:13,291
have shot tens and tens and tens of
thousands of arrows trying to win a

3488
02:50:14,021 --> 02:50:16,600
medal for the country.
But that's different.

3489
02:50:16,601 --> 02:50:18,820
You're chasing an accomplishment.
You're not fucking a bridge.

3490
02:50:19,210 --> 02:50:20,890
The ladies trying to fuck.
Meanwhile,

3491
02:50:21,310 --> 02:50:25,360
she's on our team bus.
She literally,

3492
02:50:27,370 --> 02:50:32,370
she slept with her bow one night at an,
at an event and then got an infection

3493
02:50:33,791 --> 02:50:38,791
from the silicone on the limbs and the
rest of the team had to deal with this

3494
02:50:40,121 --> 02:50:41,710
problem.
Um,

3495
02:50:41,711 --> 02:50:45,730
when you say infection,
I don't know where the infection was,

3496
02:50:45,731 --> 02:50:48,070
but I would have met Elle.
Oh No.

3497
02:50:48,370 --> 02:50:50,900
I want to have on the bottom and a step
away from it.

3498
02:50:50,920 --> 02:50:55,240
Mike Olsen,
but hey,

3499
02:50:56,050 --> 02:50:57,850
how good was she as an rj?
Jamie?

3500
02:50:58,120 --> 02:51:00,480
This is pretty rare.
He's actually like

3501
02:51:02,670 --> 02:51:04,420
son of a bitch.
Um,

3502
02:51:04,421 --> 02:51:05,710
how good was,
she has an archer.

3503
02:51:06,340 --> 02:51:08,800
She must have been very good.
She was on a team,

3504
02:51:08,950 --> 02:51:09,783
right?
Oh,

3505
02:51:10,070 --> 02:51:14,230
putting the hat on the bow.
Not a good time actually look like pot

3506
02:51:14,231 --> 02:51:16,960
holder,
but she must have been like a worldclass

3507
02:51:16,961 --> 02:51:17,890
archer.
Right?

3508
02:51:18,760 --> 02:51:20,200
Don't do it.
Don't do it to me.

3509
02:51:20,201 --> 02:51:21,130
John does.
I would say

3510
02:51:23,020 --> 02:51:24,880
decent.
Good Archer.

3511
02:51:25,630 --> 02:51:26,500
Dangerous,
decent.

3512
02:51:27,970 --> 02:51:29,140
Here's,
here's the thing.

3513
02:51:29,350 --> 02:51:32,500
Okay,
so she married the Eiffel Tower.

3514
02:51:33,130 --> 02:51:36,610
How'd that work out?
I think she's still married to it.

3515
02:51:36,640 --> 02:51:37,870
Friends.
People were pissed.

3516
02:51:37,871 --> 02:51:40,420
This is true.
This is 100% true.

3517
02:51:41,320 --> 02:51:46,000
French people are pissed because
American just goes over there,

3518
02:51:46,090 --> 02:51:48,850
gets his fiance visa,
marries a tower.

3519
02:51:49,330 --> 02:51:51,940
Right.
So now we got to dual citizenship.

3520
02:51:53,550 --> 02:51:56,760
Meanwhile she's got this thing for the
Berlin Wall.

3521
02:51:58,400 --> 02:51:59,450
Yeah.
Okay.

3522
02:51:59,451 --> 02:52:01,700
Well the Berlin Wall was a flirt first
of all.

3523
02:52:01,910 --> 02:52:05,890
So what Berlin Wall is always like being
real and

3524
02:52:06,190 --> 02:52:09,450
giving you this extra long hugs.
The Berlin Wall.

3525
02:52:09,800 --> 02:52:12,760
Fucking asked for it.
Jamie cannot.

3526
02:52:12,850 --> 02:52:15,240
Of course she's,
she's in love with the Berlin Wall hose.

3527
02:52:15,310 --> 02:52:16,320
Dot.
How about you?

3528
02:52:16,390 --> 02:52:18,910
Gotta married.
She's married to Eiffel though.

3529
02:52:18,911 --> 02:52:20,830
So here's the deal.
Listen to this.

3530
02:52:21,000 --> 02:52:26,000
I want Joe to listen to this.
I just randomly picked a spot.

3531
02:52:27,280 --> 02:52:32,280
Her last name is eiffel though.
She literally took the legal name and

3532
02:52:32,851 --> 02:52:36,790
her name is her name.
Originally it was Islah bree and I had

3533
02:52:36,791 --> 02:52:38,840
to travel with her,
but now it's Iowa.

3534
02:52:38,990 --> 02:52:42,070
I uh,
eyeful Jamie,

3535
02:52:42,071 --> 02:52:44,050
I have to send you something that,
uh,

3536
02:52:44,290 --> 02:52:47,020
someone sent me today that I sent to
Brian Cowen.

3537
02:52:47,050 --> 02:52:50,350
I'm going to send you it in two seconds.
Um,

3538
02:52:51,220 --> 02:52:54,880
who did that think about France moves to
see,

3539
02:52:54,881 --> 02:52:57,220
just so you could probably Google it.
France moves,

3540
02:52:57,250 --> 02:52:59,800
it's on NPR,
so it's legit.

3541
02:52:59,980 --> 02:53:04,980
France moves to make 15 the lead legal
age of consent for sex.

3542
02:53:05,940 --> 02:53:10,150
And it's because a bunch of dudes got in
trouble for having sex with 11 year

3543
02:53:10,151 --> 02:53:11,410
olds.
What?

3544
02:53:11,890 --> 02:53:14,690
Yeah,
we were talking about Roman or not.

3545
02:53:14,750 --> 02:53:18,010
I'll leave that.
France moves to make age 15,

3546
02:53:18,130 --> 02:53:20,020
the legal age of consent for sex.
Like,

3547
02:53:20,021 --> 02:53:20,860
whoa.

3548
02:53:23,410 --> 02:53:25,870
There's a,
there's parts of the world that are just

3549
02:53:25,871 --> 02:53:28,270
not where we are right now.
Nope.

3550
02:53:28,450 --> 02:53:32,360
They're just not,
you don't look at that like you got to

3551
02:53:32,560 --> 02:53:35,260
who was saying this?
Who's saying 15?

3552
02:53:35,610 --> 02:53:39,430
Like woody,
what you 15 for what an 80 year old,

3553
02:53:39,700 --> 02:53:42,190
an 80 year old can fuck a 15 year old.
Is that what you just said?

3554
02:53:42,340 --> 02:53:44,740
I'll kill you.
I will fucking kill you.

3555
02:53:45,420 --> 02:53:47,590
Hearing guns.
As long as violence,

3556
02:53:47,591 --> 02:53:50,410
coercion,
threat or surprise is not proven.

3557
02:53:50,590 --> 02:53:55,590
Sexual intercourse with a minor,
even one under 15 is considered.

3558
02:53:56,111 --> 02:53:58,560
And I don't know what that means.
Uh,

3559
02:53:58,570 --> 02:54:01,810
which is an infraction and not a crime.
It says,

3560
02:54:01,811 --> 02:54:04,060
uh,
on tench attention,

3561
02:54:04,480 --> 02:54:08,050
sexuality,
which is an infraction and not a crime.

3562
02:54:08,080 --> 02:54:11,530
I don't mean come on,
I will put a try pan right through that

3563
02:54:11,531 --> 02:54:13,480
guy's face.
Yeah.

3564
02:54:13,481 --> 02:54:17,530
They're not even blink.
This is a correction necessary.

3565
02:54:17,560 --> 02:54:20,320
You have a,
a cultural issue that's a cultural

3566
02:54:20,321 --> 02:54:22,150
issue.
Correction necessary.

3567
02:54:22,390 --> 02:54:24,340
No,
you can't fuck 10 year olds.

3568
02:54:24,370 --> 02:54:27,460
If anyone has a problem with,
with guys that are,

3569
02:54:29,830 --> 02:54:34,420
I can guess,
but that's a hunter's like idiots like

3570
02:54:34,421 --> 02:54:36,270
this.
That's terrifying.

3571
02:54:36,271 --> 02:54:39,070
That is terrible.
But I think terrifying.

3572
02:54:39,130 --> 02:54:41,290
I think this is what happens with
people,

3573
02:54:41,291 --> 02:54:45,190
man.
I think people get caught up in whatever

3574
02:54:45,191 --> 02:54:50,191
the other people around them are doing
and this is weird mob mentality method.

3575
02:54:50,220 --> 02:54:53,650
That's how was the craziest thing I've
seen all day long.

3576
02:54:54,160 --> 02:54:59,160
I mean that's ridiculous today,
2018 March,

3577
02:55:00,040 --> 02:55:02,530
2018 while we're talking,
this is on the news as of happening

3578
02:55:02,531 --> 02:55:03,710
right now in Europe to go,

3579
02:55:03,990 --> 02:55:07,370
Whoa,
let's make you to make it illegal to

3580
02:55:07,371 --> 02:55:10,370
fuck 14 year olds.
Like what?

3581
02:55:10,520 --> 02:55:12,200
You don't have that already on the
books.

3582
02:55:13,850 --> 02:55:14,650
Okay,

3583
02:55:14,650 --> 02:55:16,420
you could fucking nine year old over
there.

3584
02:55:16,570 --> 02:55:17,710
Right?
How old are they have to be?

3585
02:55:18,700 --> 02:55:21,230
Is there an age limit at all or is it
just,

3586
02:55:21,231 --> 02:55:22,070
oh,
he fucked it.

3587
02:55:22,071 --> 02:55:27,040
Bibby module module or sorry,
mercy.

3588
02:55:28,020 --> 02:55:28,320
Okay.

3589
02:55:28,320 --> 02:55:30,580
That maybe,
is there a year it should make your

3590
02:55:30,581 --> 02:55:31,930
stomach turn?
It does,

3591
02:55:31,960 --> 02:55:34,990
but here's the thing,
if you pay attention to history or if

3592
02:55:34,991 --> 02:55:37,690
you read anything about the atrocities
that,

3593
02:55:37,840 --> 02:55:39,680
why don't we learn?
Well,

3594
02:55:39,730 --> 02:55:42,550
we got,
we have learned a little at what point

3595
02:55:42,770 --> 02:55:43,810
we're,
we're,

3596
02:55:44,410 --> 02:55:46,390
we're better than we were a hundred
years ago.

3597
02:55:46,630 --> 02:55:49,000
Better than we were 200 years ago.
But

3598
02:55:49,500 --> 02:55:49,770
yeah,

3599
02:55:49,770 --> 02:55:52,230
in the past it was like really
commonplace.

3600
02:55:52,650 --> 02:55:53,483
I mean,
if you,

3601
02:55:53,650 --> 02:55:56,820
I mean if you read anything about
socrates or anything about Plato,

3602
02:55:56,821 --> 02:56:01,380
like that time of the world,
like men having sex with children and

3603
02:56:01,420 --> 02:56:04,590
little boys and stuff was like extremely
common.

3604
02:56:05,040 --> 02:56:06,420
Extremely common.
What?

3605
02:56:06,570 --> 02:56:07,403
Yeah.

3606
02:56:07,780 --> 02:56:08,020
Okay.

3607
02:56:08,020 --> 02:56:09,220
Yeah.
And parts of the world.

3608
02:56:09,221 --> 02:56:13,270
Men having sex with boys was extremely
common for humans.

3609
02:56:13,450 --> 02:56:18,450
Even in like what we would consider like
classical cultural culture,

3610
02:56:19,660 --> 02:56:22,750
intelligent civilizations like the
ancient Romans,

3611
02:56:22,751 --> 02:56:26,320
the ancient Greeks that like,
it was a normal part of life.

3612
02:56:26,800 --> 02:56:28,390
It's really weird.
You know,

3613
02:56:28,391 --> 02:56:32,590
we'd want to deny that,
but there's undeniable proof that that's

3614
02:56:32,591 --> 02:56:36,970
a fact that it's w it was way more
common in those ancient cultures than it

3615
02:56:36,971 --> 02:56:38,740
is today.
Like what is that like,

3616
02:56:38,741 --> 02:56:41,530
how did that happen?
Like why did people allow that?

3617
02:56:41,770 --> 02:56:43,450
Like why did that take place?
I don't know.

3618
02:56:43,451 --> 02:56:44,800
I think there's,
you freaking out over there,

3619
02:56:44,810 --> 02:56:47,860
take some dads need to step up and beat
some ass.

3620
02:56:48,280 --> 02:56:51,310
Okay.
In 2005 the core DDI cuss,

3621
02:56:51,311 --> 02:56:56,311
say tion Frances highest criminal court
stipulated that coercion is presumed for

3622
02:56:57,761 --> 02:57:02,761
children at a very young age and quotes.
That's an outrageously blurry

3623
02:57:03,431 --> 02:57:06,310
formulation.
That in practice has largely been

3624
02:57:06,311 --> 02:57:11,311
applied to children under six what?
This leaves children above sex above six

3625
02:57:13,061 --> 02:57:16,840
years old,
six potentially considered not raped

3626
02:57:17,440 --> 02:57:21,880
when violence cannot be established.
It also allows the state of paralyzed

3627
02:57:21,881 --> 02:57:26,881
shock experienced by many victims and
all the more so children.

3628
02:57:29,310 --> 02:57:29,670
Okay.

3629
02:57:29,670 --> 02:57:32,220
To equal consent.
That's terrifying.

3630
02:57:32,780 --> 02:57:35,190
That is ruth,
this vikings,

3631
02:57:35,550 --> 02:57:37,600
barbarians,
barbarians.

3632
02:57:37,880 --> 02:57:38,611
And is it?
This is,

3633
02:57:38,611 --> 02:57:43,290
this is ancient European barbarian law
that's in place for thousands of years

3634
02:57:43,560 --> 02:57:45,780
and they,
they never caught up.

3635
02:57:45,880 --> 02:57:48,270
They never refixed it.
You've got to fix that.

3636
02:57:48,360 --> 02:57:51,060
This is crazy.
You have the internet fix that.

3637
02:57:51,210 --> 02:57:54,330
That's crazy.
You could have sex with someone under

3638
02:57:54,331 --> 02:57:56,940
fucking nine or six or whatever the fuck
it was.

3639
02:57:57,120 --> 02:57:58,860
That's nuts.
Yeah.

3640
02:57:58,861 --> 02:58:00,260
That's,
this isn't,

3641
02:58:00,990 --> 02:58:02,580
this isn't 16

3642
02:58:02,580 --> 02:58:07,580
two this is 2018 this is not the time
for that.

3643
02:58:08,260 --> 02:58:10,620
That it's amazing that this still
exists.

3644
02:58:11,010 --> 02:58:12,600
That's amazing.
In a,

3645
02:58:12,601 --> 02:58:17,601
in a European civilized,
it like really exalted culture like

3646
02:58:19,651 --> 02:58:22,380
France and people love the France.
It's weird.

3647
02:58:22,470 --> 02:58:27,000
They fight so passionately about some
things,

3648
02:58:27,180 --> 02:58:29,810
but then they have something so stupid.
I think they're,

3649
02:58:29,811 --> 02:58:34,650
they're just freer and a lot of ways,
which is bad and good at the same time.

3650
02:58:35,190 --> 02:58:37,710
It's bad in that regard of taking care
of children.

3651
02:58:38,010 --> 02:58:40,170
I'm like pr,
like fucking with children's heads

3652
02:58:40,171 --> 02:58:42,750
sexually,
whether you're just dooming them to this

3653
02:58:42,751 --> 02:58:44,720
life of weirdness.
Uh,

3654
02:58:45,150 --> 02:58:48,000
and you're making it legal so there's no
legal recourse.

3655
02:58:48,060 --> 02:58:52,290
Some guy I've got fucked by some old
dude when he was six.

3656
02:58:52,620 --> 02:58:54,390
That's crazy.
And that's real.

3657
02:58:54,540 --> 02:58:56,830
Luckily I don't know anyone that,
no,

3658
02:58:56,831 --> 02:58:59,010
I don't.
He like told me about that.

3659
02:58:59,550 --> 02:59:00,780
I'm sure it's happening now.

3660
02:59:01,170 --> 02:59:03,370
If that's the law,
how can,

3661
02:59:03,450 --> 02:59:05,490
how the fuck is that?
The law?

3662
02:59:05,970 --> 02:59:06,721
How's that?
The law.

3663
02:59:06,721 --> 02:59:07,750
Hi.
I'm no idea.

3664
02:59:07,780 --> 02:59:09,120
Was good to me.
Write it down.

3665
02:59:10,050 --> 02:59:13,860
We started this podcast literally in
haunted houses and

3666
02:59:15,370 --> 02:59:20,220
I've come full circle to a problem.
It's a problem.

3667
02:59:20,520 --> 02:59:23,100
And also the gift it,
it is,

3668
02:59:23,190 --> 02:59:24,900
it's both things are,
um,

3669
02:59:24,960 --> 02:59:27,720
our guide.
When Andy and I went to France,

3670
02:59:28,800 --> 02:59:31,470
he was an all tell me about that story
because that's an amazing story.

3671
02:59:31,560 --> 02:59:34,560
It wasn't guys went to the French Alps,
uh,

3672
02:59:34,561 --> 02:59:38,010
on this bow hunting,
unsuccessful bow hunting trip for tar

3673
02:59:38,011 --> 02:59:41,640
and just even though it was on,
it was fucking awesome.

3674
02:59:41,670 --> 02:59:46,440
It was success without necessarily a
harvest.

3675
02:59:46,441 --> 02:59:48,390
So well is a beautiful experience
problem.

3676
02:59:48,530 --> 02:59:49,650
Right.
It was awesome.

3677
02:59:49,860 --> 02:59:53,700
Um,
we actually went there and I think a

3678
02:59:53,790 --> 02:59:56,880
kill cliff has a dock,
a little short film on it.

3679
02:59:56,940 --> 02:59:57,773
Yeah.
Called,

3680
02:59:57,900 --> 02:59:59,970
I forget,
I think it's called high ground,

3681
03:00:01,020 --> 03:00:03,750
but andy and I,
andy got into bow hunting because of

3682
03:00:03,751 --> 03:00:05,010
you,
um,

3683
03:00:05,011 --> 03:00:10,011
you spur an interest to shooting a bow
and then actually you texted me one time

3684
03:00:11,461 --> 03:00:11,941
and said,
hey,

3685
03:00:11,941 --> 03:00:14,850
is it cool if I give you a friend of
mine's number to,

3686
03:00:15,150 --> 03:00:17,550
I want them to learn archery a little
bit better?

3687
03:00:18,060 --> 03:00:19,110
And so I said,
yeah,

3688
03:00:19,111 --> 03:00:23,820
of course.
And actually you and I had met Andy and

3689
03:00:24,060 --> 03:00:27,060
Vegas even though we don't totally
remember most of it.

3690
03:00:27,570 --> 03:00:29,340
Um,
so I said,

3691
03:00:29,341 --> 03:00:30,001
yeah,
of course.

3692
03:00:30,001 --> 03:00:33,720
And then Annie and I become,
became friends and then we went to

3693
03:00:33,721 --> 03:00:36,780
France.
And then uh,

3694
03:00:36,810 --> 03:00:41,810
we went on this epic hard,
hard high altitude hunt.

3695
03:00:42,690 --> 03:00:44,670
I was actually introduced to a andy
bumper,

3696
03:00:44,671 --> 03:00:47,160
front tait Fletcher.
Tait Fletcher knows him from the

3697
03:00:47,161 --> 03:00:52,161
crossfit world because Andy was a,
he was in somehow or another responsible

3698
03:00:52,471 --> 03:00:55,350
for something in the crosswalk.
Some something important in the crossfit

3699
03:00:55,351 --> 03:00:57,050
world,
some sort of a liaison.

3700
03:00:57,390 --> 03:01:00,400
Something I [inaudible] was there.

3701
03:01:00,490 --> 03:01:03,490
I don't really know cause I haven't
asked him about that part but I know

3702
03:01:03,491 --> 03:01:08,080
that he has background in it.
I think he was there kind of towards the

3703
03:01:08,081 --> 03:01:11,440
beginning of it.
I didn't know that's how tate yeah,

3704
03:01:11,560 --> 03:01:14,710
that's how I met Andy.
I met Andy through tape cause that's

3705
03:01:14,711 --> 03:01:16,540
crazy.
Take knew him cause tate's big in the

3706
03:01:16,541 --> 03:01:19,570
crossfit world.
I saw sweet [inaudible] actually was

3707
03:01:19,571 --> 03:01:24,571
following me on a post that I had made
and I was like this is such a small

3708
03:01:25,721 --> 03:01:27,220
world.
He's a great dude.

3709
03:01:27,221 --> 03:01:28,750
It really is.
Yeah,

3710
03:01:28,840 --> 03:01:30,760
he's awesome.
It really is.

3711
03:01:31,090 --> 03:01:33,650
He's the caveman coffee guy.
He's one of the owners of Casey.

3712
03:01:34,090 --> 03:01:35,590
Keith Jardeen.
Yeah.

3713
03:01:36,910 --> 03:01:38,740
Tate.
Just so you know,

3714
03:01:38,770 --> 03:01:43,770
Lacey Mackie,
all of those are for the or Mexico or

3715
03:01:43,930 --> 03:01:46,390
four nitrogens deadly for a normal sized
person.

3716
03:01:46,600 --> 03:01:48,340
Luckier goddamn giant.
You'd be dead.

3717
03:01:49,180 --> 03:01:50,710
Why?
You wouldn't be able to shut the fuck up

3718
03:01:50,890 --> 03:01:51,900
if you were like,
uh,

3719
03:01:51,940 --> 03:01:54,760
you know Duncan trussell size to be
bouncing off the walls right now.

3720
03:01:54,880 --> 03:01:57,970
How big is Dunkin Buck?
50.

3721
03:01:57,971 --> 03:01:59,470
Maybe.
What?

3722
03:01:59,650 --> 03:02:01,330
He's about a buck 55.
The guests.

3723
03:02:01,331 --> 03:02:02,500
Seriously?
Yeah.

3724
03:02:02,560 --> 03:02:05,650
He looks bigger than that now.
He's um,

3725
03:02:06,520 --> 03:02:10,450
maybe an inch taller than me.
I think he's five,

3726
03:02:10,451 --> 03:02:13,690
nine and I think he's more slender.
Wow.

3727
03:02:14,590 --> 03:02:17,260
You know,
cameras powerful.

3728
03:02:17,380 --> 03:02:20,470
Do you ever look at people and go,
how much does that guy way can I carry

3729
03:02:20,471 --> 03:02:21,710
him?
How far can I count on you?

3730
03:02:21,720 --> 03:02:24,760
Do you think that when you saw me,
I said this fucking dude,

3731
03:02:25,150 --> 03:02:26,920
if he blacks out,
we better have an ambulance.

3732
03:02:26,930 --> 03:02:30,070
Like get up to him.
I'm not carrying this big ass.

3733
03:02:30,970 --> 03:02:34,300
You would if it meant something I do.
It's a real,

3734
03:02:34,301 --> 03:02:36,790
what's the heaviest load you've ever
carried on your back?

3735
03:02:36,791 --> 03:02:38,890
Like when you,
if you've been like packing out an

3736
03:02:38,891 --> 03:02:40,330
animal,
if you had a gas,

3737
03:02:41,830 --> 03:02:45,490
definitely moose
have a whole quarter.

3738
03:02:46,300 --> 03:02:47,760
I think I had a quarter ahead.

3739
03:02:48,040 --> 03:02:50,110
Ooh.
How much does that,

3740
03:02:50,260 --> 03:02:52,480
I don't know.
You have to have someone help you get it

3741
03:02:52,481 --> 03:02:55,030
on.
Get it up there to where you can get

3742
03:02:55,390 --> 03:02:56,260
wait,
you know,

3743
03:02:56,261 --> 03:03:01,261
get that weight over the top of your
legs due to Moose quarter is fucking

3744
03:03:02,170 --> 03:03:03,470
heavy.
Yup.

3745
03:03:03,590 --> 03:03:08,020
I shot a young Moose.
It was not a very big Morris who was a

3746
03:03:08,021 --> 03:03:09,800
fork fork.
Hud Moose.

3747
03:03:10,700 --> 03:03:11,800
Um,
yeah,

3748
03:03:11,801 --> 03:03:13,110
it was a young,
a young men,

3749
03:03:13,600 --> 03:03:16,090
um,
in British Columbia with a,

3750
03:03:17,930 --> 03:03:20,860
um,
a powerful Ben O'brian and my coffee

3751
03:03:20,861 --> 03:03:21,530
guys.
We're just,

3752
03:03:21,530 --> 03:03:23,350
we're right where I bear hunt.
Yeah.

3753
03:03:23,351 --> 03:03:26,350
That's why when I met Ben Manel.
Well,

3754
03:03:26,490 --> 03:03:27,460
right,
exactly.

3755
03:03:27,550 --> 03:03:30,700
Which is right south of where I,
where I was.

3756
03:03:30,980 --> 03:03:34,900
We had to take a picture of me carrying
that quarter on my shoulders.

3757
03:03:35,380 --> 03:03:36,760
Magazine.
Yeah.

3758
03:03:38,230 --> 03:03:40,360
Heavy.
I didn't have to walk with it though.

3759
03:03:40,630 --> 03:03:43,660
I just had to carry it.
Like how long did you have to carry a

3760
03:03:43,661 --> 03:03:45,970
moose shoulder on your,
on your back?

3761
03:03:45,971 --> 03:03:49,600
How far when he far,
how far did you pack it out?

3762
03:03:49,630 --> 03:03:51,070
Three,
400 yards

3763
03:03:52,840 --> 03:03:54,370
so that you know,
um,

3764
03:03:54,910 --> 03:03:57,710
remy warren ruined his body

3765
03:03:58,070 --> 03:04:00,060
carrying a moose out.
It took,

3766
03:04:00,380 --> 03:04:04,500
I think he said it took several days of
going back and forth.

3767
03:04:04,501 --> 03:04:07,610
There were many,
many miles in and so they go miles in,

3768
03:04:07,640 --> 03:04:09,680
grab like a hundred pounds of moose
meat.

3769
03:04:09,710 --> 03:04:10,670
A Moose,
by the way,

3770
03:04:11,030 --> 03:04:15,770
he might have 700 pounds of me seemed,
if you bone it out,

3771
03:04:16,010 --> 03:04:19,760
you have seven trips,
you know however many people you have,

3772
03:04:19,790 --> 03:04:23,300
you have seven individual packages of
hundred pounds of meat.

3773
03:04:23,301 --> 03:04:28,301
You got to get out through miles and
miles and miles of dead falls and cliffy

3774
03:04:28,791 --> 03:04:32,900
rocky fucking you might get cliffed out.
You might take a wrong path.

3775
03:04:33,780 --> 03:04:34,660
Yeah.
Hey,

3776
03:04:34,920 --> 03:04:36,490
hey crossfit.
Um,

3777
03:04:36,710 --> 03:04:41,710
what is it?
18.3 how about through 200 pounds on

3778
03:04:41,931 --> 03:04:46,931
your back and literally go from one
interview your town to the next.

3779
03:04:47,930 --> 03:04:49,260
Yeah.
When remy was telling you about it,

3780
03:04:49,261 --> 03:04:49,940
I was like,
that,

3781
03:04:49,940 --> 03:04:52,040
that sounds crazy.
But like what?

3782
03:04:52,490 --> 03:04:57,260
Incredible mental fortitude.
This guy had incredible mental fortitude

3783
03:04:57,470 --> 03:05:01,490
that he figured out how to get through
all the things that he said.

3784
03:05:01,490 --> 03:05:03,170
Fuck that meet.
I'll leave it back there.

3785
03:05:03,171 --> 03:05:04,970
Some coyotes will eat it.
Who Cares?

3786
03:05:05,150 --> 03:05:07,100
It's not going to waste.
I'm not going back.

3787
03:05:07,280 --> 03:05:09,500
It's not worth it.
He went back.

3788
03:05:09,610 --> 03:05:11,510
Oh yeah,
and over and over again.

3789
03:05:11,511 --> 03:05:14,570
I think,
I want to say it was three or four days

3790
03:05:14,840 --> 03:05:17,060
of packing out this Mousse.
Yeah,

3791
03:05:17,061 --> 03:05:21,080
I bet that's the,
that's the real western hunting that

3792
03:05:21,081 --> 03:05:23,780
people don't understand.
They don't understand this.

3793
03:05:23,781 --> 03:05:27,050
This is not elmer fudd with an orange
jacket.

3794
03:05:27,200 --> 03:05:28,990
The shooting at deer,
you know,

3795
03:05:29,130 --> 03:05:31,160
hates animals.
This is not that.

3796
03:05:31,190 --> 03:05:36,190
This is some crazy physical endeavor
that's highly difficult.

3797
03:05:36,561 --> 03:05:40,730
You need another one and another one.
I got one more drive in today.

3798
03:05:40,970 --> 03:05:44,740
It's two milligrams of caffeine.
You've had more honestly,

3799
03:05:44,770 --> 03:05:47,330
thousand milligrams caffeine.
Perfect.

3800
03:05:47,380 --> 03:05:51,770
I'm on par.
That right there is why hunters are

3801
03:05:51,771 --> 03:05:56,690
willing to,
to argue with people that slam hunting

3802
03:05:57,080 --> 03:05:58,640
and say that we're just killers.

3803
03:05:59,330 --> 03:06:04,330
Because if you had to put 800 packs of
your ribeye steak on your back and walk

3804
03:06:08,241 --> 03:06:13,241
it five miles home,
would you feel more passionate about it?

3805
03:06:13,910 --> 03:06:15,650
Well that would be ridiculous.
I was still,

3806
03:06:15,660 --> 03:06:18,440
it was just do eight trips.
Jesus Christ,

3807
03:06:18,470 --> 03:06:20,480
but it's trade a hundred pounds on your
back.

3808
03:06:20,481 --> 03:06:22,550
It seems excessive,
but it's true.

3809
03:06:22,551 --> 03:06:25,370
I mean if you have,
you have a moose even enough,

3810
03:06:25,430 --> 03:06:26,510
that's not even enough.
I don't,

3811
03:06:26,511 --> 03:06:28,700
I don't think to really complete the
cycle.

3812
03:06:28,940 --> 03:06:31,790
I think you'd have to be there.
You either have to be the one who pulls

3813
03:06:31,791 --> 03:06:34,340
the trigger or you have to be there when
it happens.

3814
03:06:34,460 --> 03:06:37,190
You have to see what the difference
between a living animal and dead animal.

3815
03:06:37,340 --> 03:06:41,630
Cause if you don't then you're,
you're formulating your entire picture

3816
03:06:41,631 --> 03:06:46,130
of the world based on information that
you're only getting from a video.

3817
03:06:46,310 --> 03:06:48,050
Right.
It's like what we were talking about,

3818
03:06:48,051 --> 03:06:51,140
the difference between watching porn and
having sex.

3819
03:06:51,230 --> 03:06:53,950
It's really similar.
The difference between understanding

3820
03:06:53,970 --> 03:06:56,130
this in terms of like it on video

3821
03:06:56,310 --> 03:06:59,220
and actually being there like,
oh this is what it looks like when a cow

3822
03:06:59,221 --> 03:07:00,520
dies.
This is what it looks like.

3823
03:07:00,540 --> 03:07:04,080
Me Hang Hangup by its ankles and gut it.
This is how I feel about this now.

3824
03:07:04,230 --> 03:07:08,550
I had one feeling about this before when
I was nicely insulated by all the

3825
03:07:08,560 --> 03:07:11,730
prides.
Got a nice white styrofoam little tray

3826
03:07:11,731 --> 03:07:13,820
with Saran wrap and a nice piece of rib
eye.

3827
03:07:13,890 --> 03:07:16,770
Oh look at that.
I'm going to get the fucking briquettes

3828
03:07:16,771 --> 03:07:19,020
out there and start the grill.
Woo.

3829
03:07:19,050 --> 03:07:22,080
You get all excited when it's not their
fault.

3830
03:07:22,230 --> 03:07:25,590
It's just we are.
We're even through our entire

3831
03:07:25,591 --> 03:07:29,400
developmental process.
We're shielded through one of the most

3832
03:07:29,401 --> 03:07:31,980
important parts of life.
Where does your food come from?

3833
03:07:32,190 --> 03:07:34,230
It should be like one of the number one
things you think of.

3834
03:07:34,410 --> 03:07:36,270
Where's your family?
Are they safe?

3835
03:07:36,330 --> 03:07:38,600
Where's your food come from?
Those are question number one and

3836
03:07:38,601 --> 03:07:39,850
question number two.
Right?

3837
03:07:40,660 --> 03:07:42,910
Well it's a lot like that with the job
too.

3838
03:07:43,170 --> 03:07:44,920
I mean,
and we've had people that have come to

3839
03:07:44,921 --> 03:07:46,900
work for us are like,
okay,

3840
03:07:46,901 --> 03:07:50,260
this is what working for this business
is going to be like,

3841
03:07:50,261 --> 03:07:52,450
and then they come and then they
realize,

3842
03:07:52,570 --> 03:07:55,210
whoa,
this is completely different.

3843
03:07:55,240 --> 03:07:59,320
Whereas I've been the same.
I've s I've worked for companies that

3844
03:07:59,321 --> 03:08:03,010
I've really,
really liked and I go there and then I

3845
03:08:03,011 --> 03:08:05,110
realize,
holy cow,

3846
03:08:05,111 --> 03:08:08,380
this is a whole different thing.
Yeah.

3847
03:08:08,440 --> 03:08:10,930
Versus what it really,
really is.

3848
03:08:10,931 --> 03:08:12,460
So it gets tough.
I mean,

3849
03:08:13,600 --> 03:08:14,530
you know,
it's hard to,

3850
03:08:14,590 --> 03:08:18,280
and that's why he can't really judge
anyone because unless you've been in

3851
03:08:18,281 --> 03:08:22,960
those shoes,
it's not really fair to build an

3852
03:08:22,961 --> 03:08:25,690
assessment
easy.

3853
03:08:25,691 --> 03:08:26,524
Now

3854
03:08:26,660 --> 03:08:29,780
smart first one is my first bro.
Relax.

3855
03:08:29,830 --> 03:08:31,120
No,
you're absolutely right.

3856
03:08:31,210 --> 03:08:34,880
I mean it's nothing wrong with letting
someone know that doing something wrong

3857
03:08:34,881 --> 03:08:37,380
that's negatively affecting others.
Yup.

3858
03:08:37,410 --> 03:08:38,110
That's,
that's,

3859
03:08:38,110 --> 03:08:40,270
that's a good thing.
But there's a,

3860
03:08:40,510 --> 03:08:44,440
there's a bigger issue that's like did
when people are like constantly going

3861
03:08:44,441 --> 03:08:46,960
after other people and attacking and the
most vicious way,

3862
03:08:47,320 --> 03:08:51,120
most likely it's because they're trying
to divert attention from,

3863
03:08:51,180 --> 03:08:53,080
from how they are or,
or that,

3864
03:08:53,260 --> 03:08:55,480
that it could come back at them.
You know,

3865
03:08:55,900 --> 03:08:59,590
this is like a weird dance that people
do with liking and disliking other

3866
03:08:59,591 --> 03:09:01,570
people.
It's sign always healthy.

3867
03:09:02,110 --> 03:09:02,990
You know,
and I've,

3868
03:09:03,050 --> 03:09:06,160
I've been studying this for the longest
time and I still don't understand it

3869
03:09:06,161 --> 03:09:09,430
totally.
I have my vague assessments of how it

3870
03:09:09,431 --> 03:09:13,600
all sort of falling into place,
but I don't know totally how it's

3871
03:09:13,601 --> 03:09:16,000
working,
but I know that's the people that are

3872
03:09:16,001 --> 03:09:20,200
the most pleasant to be around are the
people that are both the most friendly,

3873
03:09:20,560 --> 03:09:24,350
the most understanding,
the most objective in the,

3874
03:09:24,351 --> 03:09:27,910
the most just just loving,
just nice people,

3875
03:09:28,000 --> 03:09:28,671
you know,
and the,

3876
03:09:28,671 --> 03:09:31,460
the friends that we all have that we
know that are like that this is,

3877
03:09:31,461 --> 03:09:32,920
this is the fun people to be around.

3878
03:09:33,100 --> 03:09:34,270
You know,
you're going to have a good time.

3879
03:09:34,320 --> 03:09:35,350
Yep.
Every time I see you,

3880
03:09:35,351 --> 03:09:37,930
I know I'm going to have a good time.
We never have a bad time.

3881
03:09:37,990 --> 03:09:39,430
We have fun times.
Oh yeah,

3882
03:09:39,520 --> 03:09:40,720
we definitely do.
Well,

3883
03:09:40,730 --> 03:09:44,140
isn't that a nice thing?
Like how come that can't be replicated

3884
03:09:44,141 --> 03:09:44,974
everywhere?

3885
03:09:45,090 --> 03:09:48,330
I wish it could.
I totally wish it could.

3886
03:09:48,450 --> 03:09:52,140
I feel like,
I feel like people that haven't

3887
03:09:52,930 --> 03:09:57,930
experienced hardship don't appreciate
the good times as much.

3888
03:09:58,780 --> 03:10:03,700
And I feel like for me anyway,
the fact that I've experienced times

3889
03:10:03,701 --> 03:10:08,701
where I've really struggled and I've had
to either up my game or co or decided to

3890
03:10:09,641 --> 03:10:10,720
quit,
which,

3891
03:10:10,780 --> 03:10:13,330
you know,
that's your choices either either you

3892
03:10:13,331 --> 03:10:18,331
step up and you work hard enough to
where you achieve it and then at that

3893
03:10:18,371 --> 03:10:20,650
point you really,
really appreciate it.

3894
03:10:21,220 --> 03:10:24,490
Um,
which is something that I experienced

3895
03:10:24,491 --> 03:10:27,010
when you talk to me about kettle bells.
I thought,

3896
03:10:27,520 --> 03:10:29,110
okay,
well I'm not good at this,

3897
03:10:29,200 --> 03:10:32,380
so either I'm not going to be able to
relate to joe or I'm gonna learn to do

3898
03:10:32,381 --> 03:10:36,010
it right.
And I ended up going down to Austin

3899
03:10:36,011 --> 03:10:36,844
because,
um,

3900
03:10:36,910 --> 03:10:41,910
I wanted to experience it a little bit
more to where I can appreciate,

3901
03:10:41,951 --> 03:10:44,230
okay,
if Joe's doing a windmill with a

3902
03:10:44,231 --> 03:10:48,610
fricking big foot,
what is this?

3903
03:10:48,820 --> 03:10:52,120
What is this real like?
It looks easy when I watched a youtube

3904
03:10:52,121 --> 03:10:55,540
video,
but then when I grab a fricking chimp

3905
03:10:55,541 --> 03:10:56,980
and do it and,
uh,

3906
03:10:57,160 --> 03:11:00,430
I'm struggling to do it without having
my shoulder hit me in the side of the

3907
03:11:00,431 --> 03:11:01,690
face.
And then I'm thinking,

3908
03:11:01,691 --> 03:11:03,790
okay,
Joe's doing this now with a big foot.

3909
03:11:05,010 --> 03:11:10,010
I think it's like 90 90 I don't know.
Somewhere in the night.

3910
03:11:10,800 --> 03:11:14,620
Let's just say it's a 90 pound 90 pound
kettle bell.

3911
03:11:14,920 --> 03:11:15,753
You begin to realize

3912
03:11:15,950 --> 03:11:19,800
started out with the 35 pound one.
I struggled with it and then

3913
03:11:20,910 --> 03:11:23,970
it's also I'm,
I've been doing flexibility exercises

3914
03:11:23,971 --> 03:11:26,840
since I was a kid,
so when males not as difficult for me is

3915
03:11:26,850 --> 03:11:29,040
a lot of other people.
It was actually pretty easy for me to

3916
03:11:29,041 --> 03:11:32,820
pick up because my body's used to
whipping like everything's kicking.

3917
03:11:33,280 --> 03:11:35,610
Right.
All that kicking and shit kicking is a

3918
03:11:35,611 --> 03:11:38,640
lot of is with your hips,
a lot of is with your waist and your

3919
03:11:38,641 --> 03:11:40,410
hips.
When you learn how to like really throw

3920
03:11:40,411 --> 03:11:42,510
power and things,
that's where it all comes from.

3921
03:11:42,511 --> 03:11:44,670
So the windmill,
it's like a natural movement of that.

3922
03:11:44,850 --> 03:11:47,190
Like those muscles were already
conditioned and strengthened.

3923
03:11:47,350 --> 03:11:50,350
I feel like I'm adding and totally
inadequate.

3924
03:11:51,040 --> 03:11:53,980
When I looked at you,
I t I do,

3925
03:11:54,610 --> 03:11:58,510
I mean I work out every day,
but

3926
03:12:01,150 --> 03:12:04,000
my physique,
I feel like a lot of people look at my

3927
03:12:04,001 --> 03:12:05,860
physique from a distance and they think,
oh,

3928
03:12:05,861 --> 03:12:10,861
that guy is in really good shape.
But then like I look at you and

3929
03:12:11,590 --> 03:12:16,540
sometimes your abdomen protrudes a
little bit and then I've been rooms or

3930
03:12:16,541 --> 03:12:19,600
joe takes his shirt off and he's like a
Frickin,

3931
03:12:20,110 --> 03:12:23,260
he's jacked.
Don't let them fool you and work out.

3932
03:12:23,440 --> 03:12:24,760
Yeah,
he works out.

3933
03:12:24,761 --> 03:12:26,080
I'm trying to fool people.
Yeah.

3934
03:12:26,500 --> 03:12:31,150
He has a little bit of an abdomen that
goes out further than this tax.

3935
03:12:32,090 --> 03:12:35,410
It's only honest with you.
I can't even believe you have that skin

3936
03:12:35,800 --> 03:12:40,800
because I've been in my life.
Your six pack sticks out further than

3937
03:12:41,171 --> 03:12:42,004
your Pec deck

3938
03:12:44,710 --> 03:12:47,350
versus my Pec deck.
I'm going to show you some of the shit

3939
03:12:47,351 --> 03:12:48,310
that I do out here.
Uh,

3940
03:12:48,400 --> 03:12:49,390
we'll,
we'll do a little,

3941
03:12:49,391 --> 03:12:50,470
uh,
working out here.

3942
03:12:50,471 --> 03:12:53,060
But one of the that I've really gotten
into is,

3943
03:12:53,061 --> 03:12:56,360
um,
there's like a circuit of a glute ham

3944
03:12:56,361 --> 03:13:00,350
machine that does your lower back.
And then I do these elevated setups.

3945
03:13:00,560 --> 03:13:02,950
And then I do compression machine or no,
no,

3946
03:13:02,960 --> 03:13:04,010
no,
no.

3947
03:13:04,060 --> 03:13:05,420
That's,
that's the third one.

3948
03:13:05,510 --> 03:13:07,640
That's the,
I'm a reverse hyper.

3949
03:13:07,670 --> 03:13:11,540
That's the third one.
But I do this whole series of things

3950
03:13:11,541 --> 03:13:15,890
that I'm doing for ABS.
It's tremendous for abs and back.

3951
03:13:16,190 --> 03:13:18,640
And I like the sturdiness of your core
and just,

3952
03:13:18,650 --> 03:13:21,440
I feel like if I just do these on a
regular basis,

3953
03:13:21,441 --> 03:13:26,290
it makes it just a giant difference in
how my body moves and how stable I feel.

3954
03:13:26,430 --> 03:13:30,770
I feel like that's why you were good at
word tree is because core so solid.

3955
03:13:30,920 --> 03:13:34,520
I think it's a really,
really good foundation and other

3956
03:13:34,521 --> 03:13:35,960
foundations,
those club bells,

3957
03:13:35,990 --> 03:13:39,440
I'm really in those club bells.
I do all the shield cast with those

3958
03:13:39,441 --> 03:13:41,420
clubs.
There's something about when you do

3959
03:13:41,421 --> 03:13:43,850
that,
when you're controlling like a 25 pound

3960
03:13:43,851 --> 03:13:45,860
club,
it doesn't seem like a lot of weight.

3961
03:13:46,100 --> 03:13:49,490
But if you could slowly control that,
when you get a bow in your hand and

3962
03:13:49,491 --> 03:13:51,620
you're trying to level that bow,
it's like you're,

3963
03:13:51,621 --> 03:13:55,820
you have more control of your body.
You have better understanding of,

3964
03:13:55,880 --> 03:13:56,541
you know,
the,

3965
03:13:56,541 --> 03:13:58,460
all the,
the various uh,

3966
03:13:58,461 --> 03:14:01,610
speeds that your muscles can move at.
We could just slow it down,

3967
03:14:01,611 --> 03:14:02,750
slow it down.
There it is.

3968
03:14:02,751 --> 03:14:03,584
There it is.
There it is.

3969
03:14:03,770 --> 03:14:07,040
And I feel like the more you strengthen
those muscles,

3970
03:14:07,041 --> 03:14:11,000
particularly stabilizing muscles of the
shoulders with like reverse kettle

3971
03:14:11,001 --> 03:14:11,770
bells,
you know,

3972
03:14:11,770 --> 03:14:13,690
kettle upside down kettlebells where the
bottoms,

3973
03:14:13,720 --> 03:14:14,510
I love those.

3974
03:14:14,510 --> 03:14:17,060
Those are great because those are even a
lightweight,

3975
03:14:17,061 --> 03:14:20,990
you're just do it slow and it's well
wiggling and she is big time hammer

3976
03:14:20,991 --> 03:14:23,810
curls too.
So good to deltoid,

3977
03:14:23,840 --> 03:14:28,310
full Schulte military shoulder press
with the vertical kettle bell and then,

3978
03:14:28,340 --> 03:14:31,070
but don't sleep on those windmills too
cause it's the same thing.

3979
03:14:31,071 --> 03:14:34,100
It's all shoulder stability actually.
And flexibility.

3980
03:14:34,520 --> 03:14:37,940
Being able to go to the floor is a big,
big aspect.

3981
03:14:37,941 --> 03:14:39,110
It's huge.
It's huge.

3982
03:14:39,111 --> 03:14:41,570
And it's just,
I feel like if as long as you don't

3983
03:14:41,571 --> 03:14:43,910
overdo it,
I don't think there's any danger of

3984
03:14:43,911 --> 03:14:46,220
injuring yourself.
I think if you do it correctly,

3985
03:14:46,460 --> 03:14:48,950
it's actually the opposite.
I think it strengthens everything.

3986
03:14:49,160 --> 03:14:52,100
Strengthens the whole chain from your
arms,

3987
03:14:52,160 --> 03:14:55,100
your shoulders to your court,
your hips to your legs.

3988
03:14:55,340 --> 03:14:57,800
The whole thing gets strengthened
because everything has to move.

3989
03:14:57,840 --> 03:15:00,770
Yup.
I went to a on at academy,

3990
03:15:01,460 --> 03:15:03,890
I think last summer.
I'm,

3991
03:15:03,891 --> 03:15:07,040
Sharon and I were down there for,
actually,

3992
03:15:07,041 --> 03:15:08,180
I think it was September,

3993
03:15:08,250 --> 03:15:11,910
we were down there for the hurricane
harvey.

3994
03:15:12,630 --> 03:15:13,500
We were down there.

3995
03:15:13,730 --> 03:15:16,250
We raised some newer,
you're feeding people and everything

3996
03:15:16,300 --> 03:15:17,120
too.
Yeah.

3997
03:15:17,120 --> 03:15:18,350
We raised this money.
Cool.

3998
03:15:18,351 --> 03:15:19,730
Have you,
that was very cool.

3999
03:15:20,180 --> 03:15:22,160
Part of that was because of the house
fire.

4000
03:15:22,250 --> 03:15:26,750
I mean obviously when I was someone who
lost everything,

4001
03:15:26,870 --> 03:15:31,010
so I understand where that comes from.
So when the,

4002
03:15:31,450 --> 03:15:36,450
I was actually on a hunt with Andy up in
Alberta when the hurricane happened and

4003
03:15:37,341 --> 03:15:40,070
I was completely disconnected from the
news.

4004
03:15:40,700 --> 03:15:44,030
I got a text from Sharon that just said,
you won't believe what's happening down

4005
03:15:44,031 --> 03:15:48,110
in Houston.
So we ended up coming in and I looked it

4006
03:15:48,111 --> 03:15:49,160
up,
uh,

4007
03:15:49,200 --> 03:15:54,200
with Wifi while we were in town.
And then I showed Annie and I said,

4008
03:15:55,111 --> 03:15:56,880
man,
this is terrible what's happening in,

4009
03:15:56,881 --> 03:15:59,460
down in Texas.
So He's like,

4010
03:16:01,010 --> 03:16:02,840
I wish we could do something.
I said,

4011
03:16:02,841 --> 03:16:03,674
well,
I'm Gunna,

4012
03:16:03,710 --> 03:16:08,150
so I just,
I ended up going live and offering to

4013
03:16:08,151 --> 03:16:13,151
auction off my bow during a live feed
and we ended up raising,

4014
03:16:14,810 --> 03:16:18,920
thankfully there were three bidders.
I don't know if I can announce who they

4015
03:16:18,921 --> 03:16:22,250
were,
but there were three bidders that bid,

4016
03:16:22,400 --> 03:16:25,130
um,
about 15 grand,

4017
03:16:25,160 --> 03:16:28,160
I think it was,
think it was 20,

4018
03:16:28,460 --> 03:16:33,460
let me think.
It was about 2100 bucks or 22,000.

4019
03:16:33,620 --> 03:16:38,060
And then we had one person that offered
to match the other two.

4020
03:16:38,090 --> 03:16:41,150
So it ended up getting to be 30,000 that
we raised,

4021
03:16:41,630 --> 03:16:44,150
uh,
went down to Houston and then,

4022
03:16:44,180 --> 03:16:47,690
um,
crispy who was doing a lot of,

4023
03:16:47,750 --> 03:16:52,750
um,
a lot of really cool things for getting

4024
03:16:52,941 --> 03:16:55,630
supplies into the Houston area.
Crispy.

4025
03:16:55,640 --> 03:16:58,430
The hunting boot company?
No crispy.

4026
03:16:58,520 --> 03:17:00,110
Uh,
that's his instagram.

4027
03:17:00,500 --> 03:17:01,670
I don't know.
It was a dude.

4028
03:17:01,700 --> 03:17:02,820
Yeah,
he's a guy.

4029
03:17:02,940 --> 03:17:04,730
Crispy.
I thought you meant crispy boots.

4030
03:17:05,300 --> 03:17:06,110
No.
Okay.

4031
03:17:06,110 --> 03:17:07,400
Um,
so we,

4032
03:17:07,401 --> 03:17:10,310
we ended up raising a bunch of money.
Got It down there.

4033
03:17:10,311 --> 03:17:12,410
Went down.
You saw a lot of people to man.

4034
03:17:12,411 --> 03:17:13,850
Yup.
I watched a lot of those,

4035
03:17:13,851 --> 03:17:15,080
uh,
instagram posts.

4036
03:17:15,110 --> 03:17:16,790
I was really very,
very cool.

4037
03:17:16,820 --> 03:17:21,820
Crispy and archery country,
filled a full trailer full of supplies

4038
03:17:21,920 --> 03:17:26,920
in Sharon and I flew down to Houston or
we'll first we flew to Austin,

4039
03:17:27,111 --> 03:17:32,111
then we drove to Houston and went down
to a church where we did,

4040
03:17:32,420 --> 03:17:35,900
where we ended up feeding a lot of
people and then delivering all the

4041
03:17:35,901 --> 03:17:39,830
supplies that we raised with the money
that we got from auctioning off this

4042
03:17:39,831 --> 03:17:41,450
bow.
Um,

4043
03:17:41,630 --> 03:17:43,970
which I know what it's like to lose
everything.

4044
03:17:43,971 --> 03:17:47,010
So I was pretty adamant about it.
That's awesome.

4045
03:17:47,030 --> 03:17:47,781
Um,
yeah,

4046
03:17:47,781 --> 03:17:49,340
it was,
it was dynamite.

4047
03:17:49,341 --> 03:17:51,890
Super rewarding feeling.
Um,

4048
03:17:52,460 --> 03:17:53,910
I don't know where I'm going with that.
Oh,

4049
03:17:54,050 --> 03:17:54,621
well listen,
man,

4050
03:17:54,621 --> 03:17:56,030
it's a good story.
It's just cool.

4051
03:17:56,031 --> 03:17:58,010
And I,
I remember watching it online,

4052
03:17:58,011 --> 03:17:58,844
I'm like,
wow,

4053
03:17:59,120 --> 03:18:00,380
that's bad ass.
You know?

4054
03:18:00,381 --> 03:18:02,690
And I know how sincere you are about
that stuff too,

4055
03:18:03,080 --> 03:18:03,950
you know,
I think,

4056
03:18:03,951 --> 03:18:05,750
um,
that's a great,

4057
03:18:07,200 --> 03:18:08,730
great expression,
you know,

4058
03:18:08,880 --> 03:18:11,490
great thing to do.
You did the same thing for Vegas.

4059
03:18:11,670 --> 03:18:14,340
I mean you're passionate about certain
things and you know,

4060
03:18:14,341 --> 03:18:17,130
we've,
we've had a lot of doors open for us

4061
03:18:17,340 --> 03:18:21,540
from different communities.
Texas was a big one for me because I

4062
03:18:21,541 --> 03:18:24,240
worked for an archery company for many
years in Texas,

4063
03:18:24,241 --> 03:18:27,620
was one of my states as a sales rep.
Um,

4064
03:18:27,650 --> 03:18:29,130
did,
that's one of the few places I'd live if

4065
03:18:29,131 --> 03:18:31,670
I didn't live in California because if
you pay said live,

4066
03:18:31,671 --> 03:18:33,930
I was an la,
I think in northern California.

4067
03:18:33,990 --> 03:18:36,300
I think of like San Diego.
I like San Diego,

4068
03:18:36,450 --> 03:18:37,890
Colorado,
Montana.

4069
03:18:37,940 --> 03:18:39,690
Yeah.
Once I get out of cop once to get out of

4070
03:18:39,691 --> 03:18:41,640
California,
then I'm my Colorado,

4071
03:18:41,670 --> 03:18:42,630
Montana.
I,

4072
03:18:42,631 --> 03:18:43,710
Texas,
Texas,

4073
03:18:44,130 --> 03:18:47,710
Texas is in the mix baby.
Cause I like Texans,

4074
03:18:47,711 --> 03:18:48,250
man.

4075
03:18:48,250 --> 03:18:49,083
I like,
I,

4076
03:18:49,180 --> 03:18:52,270
there's,
there's a stereotype about the worst

4077
03:18:52,271 --> 03:18:55,420
texans,
but they're not the best Texans.

4078
03:18:55,600 --> 03:18:58,450
So you never met the best tech since the
best Texans.

4079
03:18:58,470 --> 03:18:58,961
Like,
Oh,

4080
03:18:58,961 --> 03:19:02,860
you're like some cool combination of
smart and old school.

4081
03:19:03,490 --> 03:19:05,530
You know,
you're a cool combination of like hip

4082
03:19:05,600 --> 03:19:08,350
and,
and progressive and toddler on a tiger.

4083
03:19:08,351 --> 03:19:10,300
And also you have guns.
You want a tiger?

4084
03:19:10,850 --> 03:19:12,220
He could get a dye.
Yeah.

4085
03:19:12,280 --> 03:19:13,510
Oh,
you remember,

4086
03:19:13,550 --> 03:19:15,160
did you see my bed?
Remember that bit?

4087
03:19:15,190 --> 03:19:18,400
You saw the little bit that I used to do
about Texas.

4088
03:19:19,780 --> 03:19:21,670
It's legit though.
It is legit.

4089
03:19:21,671 --> 03:19:26,671
Texas has more tigers in captivity than
all of the wild of the world.

4090
03:19:27,620 --> 03:19:27,940
Okay.

4091
03:19:27,940 --> 03:19:31,640
More in Texas.
And my joke was like one dude was like

4092
03:19:31,670 --> 03:19:33,270
going through the regulations,
like she hit,

4093
03:19:33,290 --> 03:19:36,110
I don't know,
you get a tiger ordered up to order it

4094
03:19:36,111 --> 03:19:37,910
up and then his neighbor found out,
he goes,

4095
03:19:37,911 --> 03:19:39,000
mom,
I didn't know you get tired.

4096
03:19:39,001 --> 03:19:41,120
His neighbors got to guy tires and he's
like,

4097
03:19:41,121 --> 03:19:43,190
man about ain't about to let this fag it
out.

4098
03:19:43,191 --> 03:19:46,030
Tiger me.
And he opened up tiger world.

4099
03:19:46,520 --> 03:19:50,900
It's fucking ridiculous joke.
That's based on a true fact that there's

4100
03:19:50,901 --> 03:19:53,990
more tigers in captivity in Texas than
anywhere in the world.

4101
03:19:54,320 --> 03:19:58,040
But Texas,
the thing is Texas of 2018 is not Texas

4102
03:19:58,041 --> 03:20:02,360
of even 2008 and definitely not Texas of
1,980 [inaudible] it's better and

4103
03:20:02,361 --> 03:20:04,940
smarter and it's a,
it's a good place to be.

4104
03:20:04,941 --> 03:20:07,010
Men.
Texas is a good place to be.

4105
03:20:07,190 --> 03:20:09,590
It's one of my favorite spots.
It is cool.

4106
03:20:09,650 --> 03:20:10,550
I love it there,
man.

4107
03:20:10,610 --> 03:20:12,440
I liked the people.
There's sort of,

4108
03:20:12,740 --> 03:20:15,020
it's a weird combination.
It's like a country.

4109
03:20:15,050 --> 03:20:17,030
It's a kind of think it is.
I think it is too.

4110
03:20:17,031 --> 03:20:19,970
It's a completely different

4111
03:20:20,440 --> 03:20:20,780
okay.

4112
03:20:20,780 --> 03:20:22,930
Being it,
everything about it's different,

4113
03:20:23,080 --> 03:20:23,950
isn't it?
True.

4114
03:20:24,220 --> 03:20:26,050
Well,
I always explained it on stage about

4115
03:20:26,051 --> 03:20:28,210
buckeys.
You're taking people that have never

4116
03:20:28,211 --> 03:20:31,000
been a buckeys,
which I went to the first buckeys on

4117
03:20:31,001 --> 03:20:35,260
that heat on when I took supplies down
to Houston for the hurricane.

4118
03:20:35,870 --> 03:20:36,703
Yeah.

4119
03:20:37,000 --> 03:20:39,760
That was my first time at a buckies and
I thought,

4120
03:20:40,270 --> 03:20:43,690
is this a Frickin Costco?
But with fuel,

4121
03:20:44,580 --> 03:20:47,650
it doesn't make any sense.
The way I describe it on stage,

4122
03:20:47,651 --> 03:20:52,651
I always say this is like if you were in
the middle of a full on cocaine binge,

4123
03:20:54,390 --> 03:20:56,350
well someone came up to you and said,
dude,

4124
03:20:56,351 --> 03:20:58,540
I want you to make me the ultimate gas
station.

4125
03:21:00,270 --> 03:21:03,520
It's a gas station with hundreds of
pumps.

4126
03:21:03,610 --> 03:21:05,610
Like you can't believe how many pumps
there are.

4127
03:21:05,620 --> 03:21:09,160
It doesn't make any sense.
It's like God damn field of pumps.

4128
03:21:09,460 --> 03:21:12,220
It doesn't make any sense.
And then you go into this building and

4129
03:21:12,221 --> 03:21:16,330
it is a fucking warehouse filled with
pickled alligator Dick.

4130
03:21:16,331 --> 03:21:21,320
So different kinds of jelly beans and
chuck Norris action genes and camouflage

4131
03:21:21,321 --> 03:21:23,530
and Yeti coolers and smokers.
You're like,

4132
03:21:23,531 --> 03:21:26,620
what the fuck is this?
And it's huge.

4133
03:21:27,070 --> 03:21:32,070
I mean it's like a fucking God damn
football field sized room filled with

4134
03:21:33,041 --> 03:21:37,270
jelly beans,
different kinds of Cammo and real tree.

4135
03:21:37,510 --> 03:21:40,740
There's a buckeys right there.
There you can see that's a mild bucky.

4136
03:21:40,741 --> 03:21:44,170
Is that?
That's a plug that's on the edge of the

4137
03:21:44,171 --> 03:21:48,160
fucking Wyoming or some shit.
Chuck Norris.

4138
03:21:48,170 --> 03:21:51,110
Geez,
there's so many pumps.

4139
03:21:51,260 --> 03:21:53,120
It doesn't make any sense.
Look at that right there.

4140
03:21:53,150 --> 03:21:54,470
How many pumps is that?
One,

4141
03:21:54,471 --> 03:21:59,340
two,
345678910 1112 504010202122 jets into

4142
03:21:59,360 --> 03:22:02,830
fortunate and double.
It might be on double it.

4143
03:22:02,870 --> 03:22:05,270
That might be a hundred right,
and there's two on each one,

4144
03:22:05,271 --> 03:22:08,240
so it literally might be 200 for fucking
pumps.

4145
03:22:08,670 --> 03:22:09,770
Well,
that's crazy.

4146
03:22:10,130 --> 03:22:12,860
Why doesn't Chuck Norris Make Jeans?
Sears too.

4147
03:22:12,861 --> 03:22:14,120
Awesome.
He used to,

4148
03:22:14,570 --> 03:22:16,610
he used to,
I used to own a pair of what?

4149
03:22:16,880 --> 03:22:18,340
Let's see these.
I'm alive.

4150
03:22:18,350 --> 03:22:18,951
Any,
no,

4151
03:22:18,951 --> 03:22:22,160
not anymore,
but I used to put them on the lace up in

4152
03:22:22,161 --> 03:22:23,750
the front.
They did?

4153
03:22:23,800 --> 03:22:25,250
Yeah.
The laced up in the front and let you do

4154
03:22:25,251 --> 03:22:27,110
sidekicks.
There it is.

4155
03:22:27,170 --> 03:22:28,820
Bam.
It has a gusset.

4156
03:22:29,020 --> 03:22:33,140
Looks like Chris Irwin.
They had a gusset in the crotch area.

4157
03:22:33,380 --> 03:22:34,970
I like that.
The lace up to the front,

4158
03:22:34,971 --> 03:22:39,410
so I might be lying.
That might be a little longer in scene

4159
03:22:39,411 --> 03:22:42,440
there for that.
That cowboy boot kick.

4160
03:22:42,441 --> 03:22:45,140
Well,
back in the day they didn't understand

4161
03:22:45,141 --> 03:22:47,470
about barbell jeans.
They didn't have the time.

4162
03:22:47,720 --> 03:22:52,310
Top of fabric technology.
I do have a pretty good kick distance.

4163
03:22:52,760 --> 03:22:54,770
Have you ever seen mine?
I'm sure it's very long.

4164
03:22:55,160 --> 03:22:58,010
It is.
We'll make a video it later at the top

4165
03:22:58,011 --> 03:22:59,240
of a doorway.
Ooh,

4166
03:22:59,241 --> 03:23:04,241
look at that dress shirt.
That gentleman right there will always

4167
03:23:04,371 --> 03:23:07,430
have my respect.
Him and Bruce Lee or the reason why I

4168
03:23:07,431 --> 03:23:09,680
got into martial arts a hundred percent
watch it.

4169
03:23:09,690 --> 03:23:10,970
Chuck Norris movies.
When I was a kid,

4170
03:23:11,180 --> 03:23:13,550
one of my most proudest moments of my
life was in Chuck Norris.

4171
03:23:13,551 --> 03:23:16,550
Do who I was.
I ran into him at a kickboxing event in

4172
03:23:16,551 --> 03:23:18,980
New Jersey like way back in the day,
and it gave me this big hug.

4173
03:23:18,980 --> 03:23:21,720
It was one of his events that he had.
He had a world combat.

4174
03:23:22,160 --> 03:23:23,300
He gave me a big hug.
I was like,

4175
03:23:23,301 --> 03:23:25,280
Holy Shit.
Chuck Norris knows who I am.

4176
03:23:25,310 --> 03:23:27,000
Damn right.
It couldn't have been happier.

4177
03:23:27,010 --> 03:23:30,310
No wonder you're unbreakable.
Soccer was beeman.

4178
03:23:30,710 --> 03:23:32,300
And then we'll later,
uh,

4179
03:23:32,301 --> 03:23:34,370
I took a picture of me and tate tate
again.

4180
03:23:34,690 --> 03:23:36,050
Um,
it was a,

4181
03:23:36,110 --> 03:23:41,110
a award show that they did for an old
school karate master and Chuck Norris

4182
03:23:42,321 --> 03:23:44,220
was there and a bunch of other,
uh,

4183
03:23:44,270 --> 03:23:46,520
old school,
American black belt karate guys,

4184
03:23:46,521 --> 03:23:48,960
and they're telling these awesome
oldschool karate stories.

4185
03:23:48,961 --> 03:23:51,840
They didn't ask me to be there and speak
a little bit and I would wouldn't,

4186
03:23:52,460 --> 03:23:54,470
I mean I do anything for Chuck Norris.
Like,

4187
03:23:54,471 --> 03:23:58,550
no bullshit.
Go corny as you want for watches.

4188
03:23:58,551 --> 03:24:01,730
Chuck Norris changed.
He changed my life for real.

4189
03:24:02,210 --> 03:24:04,220
If it wasn't for Chuck Norris movies,
who knows,

4190
03:24:04,221 --> 03:24:05,690
I might not ever got into martial arts.

4191
03:24:05,810 --> 03:24:08,210
I watched him and like lone wolf,
mcquaid and shit.

4192
03:24:08,240 --> 03:24:09,080
I was like,
God damn,

4193
03:24:09,081 --> 03:24:10,400
that might be the coolest guy that's
ever lived.

4194
03:24:10,430 --> 03:24:11,860
Did she laugh?
Uh,

4195
03:24:12,110 --> 03:24:15,500
the other night in Vegas when we were
talking about what my wife,

4196
03:24:15,501 --> 03:24:19,400
Sharon's name was supposed to be and
when we're coming up with fake names for

4197
03:24:19,401 --> 03:24:22,760
people know her,
what she was saying at Debra?

4198
03:24:23,090 --> 03:24:24,710
No,
but that was the fake name.

4199
03:24:24,711 --> 03:24:28,100
He goes the fake name.
My wife's name.

4200
03:24:28,370 --> 03:24:31,840
Her Dad actually wanted to name right.
Bruce Lee.

4201
03:24:31,910 --> 03:24:32,743
Oh,
that's right.

4202
03:24:33,050 --> 03:24:36,950
That was the crazy story of all time.
I forgot about that dude.

4203
03:24:37,500 --> 03:24:41,390
Share and vape pens.
He knew making a rude if your mood,

4204
03:24:41,510 --> 03:24:43,920
if you knew Sharon,
you would laugh at this.

4205
03:24:43,921 --> 03:24:47,670
But uh,
her dad was in a nun chucks and all

4206
03:24:47,671 --> 03:24:52,170
kinds of solar and wind to my wife.
When my wife was born.

4207
03:24:52,560 --> 03:24:53,820
They didn't know what she was going to
be.

4208
03:24:53,821 --> 03:24:58,230
So they had a,
he really wanted her name to be Bruce

4209
03:24:58,230 --> 03:24:59,340
Lee.
But if you knew Sharon,

4210
03:24:59,341 --> 03:25:00,510
you'd knew,
you know,

4211
03:25:00,511 --> 03:25:05,090
she is far from briefly.
Do we have any more Alpha brain we need?

4212
03:25:07,740 --> 03:25:10,500
Um,
I made a deal with my wife.

4213
03:25:10,501 --> 03:25:12,960
I said,
I'm not naming the kids.

4214
03:25:13,200 --> 03:25:14,490
I'm like,
I just have veto power.

4215
03:25:14,700 --> 03:25:15,690
I mean,
this is not fair.

4216
03:25:16,050 --> 03:25:16,731
I go,
I just,

4217
03:25:16,731 --> 03:25:19,620
it's like that was a good story to,
it grew in your body.

4218
03:25:19,800 --> 03:25:20,633
I'm like,
I'm not,

4219
03:25:21,090 --> 03:25:22,950
I'm not telling you what to name them.
I mean,

4220
03:25:22,951 --> 03:25:24,390
I will.
I will 100% be there,

4221
03:25:24,391 --> 03:25:26,760
but I'm saying like this,
let's not pretend this is an even

4222
03:25:26,761 --> 03:25:31,761
proposition like you doing that like
99.99999% of the work.

4223
03:25:32,161 --> 03:25:33,920
Like you just,
as long as you don't call them fucking

4224
03:25:33,930 --> 03:25:37,230
apple sauce or something crazy.
This is my kid pixie.

4225
03:25:37,380 --> 03:25:40,080
You're not going to torture them with
your wacky bullshit,

4226
03:25:40,110 --> 03:25:44,100
but KCC.
I just gave my suggestions,

4227
03:25:44,101 --> 03:25:45,180
my feelings,
but I was like,

4228
03:25:45,181 --> 03:25:48,780
there's no way it's fair for me to name
the kid.

4229
03:25:49,050 --> 03:25:50,400
You know?
Actually,

4230
03:25:50,630 --> 03:25:53,340
she did have some goofy ass name for
dudes and I might've had to put the

4231
03:25:53,341 --> 03:25:54,270
fucking stamp on.

4232
03:25:55,950 --> 03:25:59,760
I know how hard it is for guys.
Like a guy like John or a guy like joe

4233
03:25:59,880 --> 03:26:01,450
that's,
those are good names there.

4234
03:26:01,460 --> 03:26:02,490
Solid,
solid.

4235
03:26:02,550 --> 03:26:04,950
There is.
You can't file ood your fucking named

4236
03:26:04,951 --> 03:26:05,850
John.
You'd be like,

4237
03:26:06,390 --> 03:26:09,150
what are you talking about?
I had to see but like a fool.

4238
03:26:09,210 --> 03:26:13,620
I had a CB uh,
in junior high and I actually,

4239
03:26:13,650 --> 03:26:17,570
I've always loved frogs.
I know you have a frog tattoo and you're

4240
03:26:17,571 --> 03:26:19,320
okay.
Jamie.

4241
03:26:19,410 --> 03:26:22,110
Google a Pixie frog.
What's a Pixie frog?

4242
03:26:22,650 --> 03:26:25,140
So the real thing,
I used to have several.

4243
03:26:25,170 --> 03:26:29,250
I had a pixie frogs.
I like Jamie's a little controversial,

4244
03:26:29,380 --> 03:26:32,670
right?
I got get shit for that a little bit

4245
03:26:32,671 --> 03:26:35,220
because it's a girl's name was no other
fuckers.

4246
03:26:35,221 --> 03:26:37,890
Those motherfuckers who came first.
Hello Kelly.

4247
03:26:37,891 --> 03:26:40,610
Kelly's like always a back and forth.
When came first though,

4248
03:26:40,650 --> 03:26:43,260
it's pat was on.
So like when I was like that a kid

4249
03:26:44,160 --> 03:26:49,160
Saturday that Sammy Saturday night live
fricking ruin and pat shelley's and

4250
03:26:49,901 --> 03:26:50,400
other ones.

4251
03:26:50,400 --> 03:26:54,420
Shelley used to be a common name for a
gentlemen was Shelly Finkel.

4252
03:26:54,840 --> 03:26:56,220
Shelly Finkel.
You see one of them?

4253
03:26:56,250 --> 03:26:59,190
Mike Tyson is a financial managers.
Yeah.

4254
03:26:59,430 --> 03:27:01,680
Pixie frogs are pretty big.
Shelly Shit.

4255
03:27:01,681 --> 03:27:03,990
There's a bunch of shelley's,
a bunch of old Jewish men.

4256
03:27:04,020 --> 03:27:05,810
That was shelly's sheldon,
right at the shelter.

4257
03:27:05,900 --> 03:27:08,310
Yes.
Shelly Kelly.

4258
03:27:08,460 --> 03:27:10,890
Shelly.
I know a dude named Kelly got a fucking

4259
03:27:10,891 --> 03:27:12,840
tattoo on his neck.
What's up bitch?

4260
03:27:12,841 --> 03:27:17,790
A punch you in the face
kick isn't used anymore except for like

4261
03:27:17,791 --> 03:27:18,930
if someone's being a dick.
Yeah,

4262
03:27:18,931 --> 03:27:20,510
you're right.
Back in the day.

4263
03:27:20,760 --> 03:27:25,760
Here's the crazy thing about dick.
Dick was from Richard and then how was

4264
03:27:26,251 --> 03:27:28,680
that possible?
Jack's from John.

4265
03:27:28,740 --> 03:27:30,720
How has chuck from Charles?

4266
03:27:33,680 --> 03:27:36,060
I looked that one up.
These are all like Jack thing.

4267
03:27:36,061 --> 03:27:38,580
It's like the Irish.
I think they would just learn how to

4268
03:27:38,581 --> 03:27:42,610
talk fucking ape.
Well,

4269
03:27:42,611 --> 03:27:45,940
my dad's middle name is definitely
straight on a page.

4270
03:27:46,300 --> 03:27:50,140
My Dad's middle name is deloitte.
Deloitte deal.

4271
03:27:50,250 --> 03:27:55,250
Why like exactly like homer Simpson.
No,

4272
03:27:55,541 --> 03:27:57,400
homeless him.
Look at that.

4273
03:27:57,550 --> 03:27:59,210
Oh my God.
My tank.

4274
03:28:00,010 --> 03:28:01,480
What's happening to the show?
Dude?

4275
03:28:01,481 --> 03:28:03,500
I used to have to grow in life.
No,

4276
03:28:03,520 --> 03:28:07,330
this is a Pixie frog,
but you're just not just pixie frog and

4277
03:28:07,340 --> 03:28:11,770
fixie frog eating a fucking rat with
it's poking out the camera.

4278
03:28:11,800 --> 03:28:16,660
I would have to buy mice to feed my,
to pete feed my pixie frog because he

4279
03:28:16,661 --> 03:28:19,390
ate mice to look at the size of that.
Go back to that one.

4280
03:28:19,391 --> 03:28:23,020
Please look at the size of its body with
the full mouse in his body.

4281
03:28:23,070 --> 03:28:26,230
He just expands like a water balloon.
That's crazy.

4282
03:28:27,070 --> 03:28:29,140
That's such a crazy,
she's like frogs.

4283
03:28:29,141 --> 03:28:32,710
And I thought they were really cool.
Especially pixie frogs.

4284
03:28:32,740 --> 03:28:36,430
They were super aggressive.
They would eat something up to their

4285
03:28:36,431 --> 03:28:37,820
size.
Holy Shit.

4286
03:28:37,821 --> 03:28:41,770
Like you could put a mouse in their cage
the same size as them and they would

4287
03:28:41,771 --> 03:28:46,771
tackle it crick and smoke it.
I had them have you never seen him?

4288
03:28:47,230 --> 03:28:48,670
It's a little tiny monster,
right?

4289
03:28:48,740 --> 03:28:49,980
So my,
yeah.

4290
03:28:51,990 --> 03:28:54,340
Oh my God.
Oh my God.

4291
03:28:54,380 --> 03:28:56,470
We go all the way up Joe.
Oh my God.

4292
03:28:56,680 --> 03:29:00,080
Take that picture and send it to me.
Take a picture of that.

4293
03:29:00,110 --> 03:29:01,630
Sends me,
there might be the greatest picture I've

4294
03:29:01,631 --> 03:29:04,720
ever seen in my life.
Save image.

4295
03:29:04,860 --> 03:29:08,110
So,
so my shit out of me with that

4296
03:29:09,700 --> 03:29:14,530
handle Pixie.
And I didn't know that a Pixie wasn't

4297
03:29:14,531 --> 03:29:17,140
cool until someone else like address me
on it.

4298
03:29:17,141 --> 03:29:19,120
But I always saw the rock.
It's like a trick.

4299
03:29:19,240 --> 03:29:21,400
It's like the most demonic ruthless
thing.

4300
03:29:21,490 --> 03:29:23,710
How many animals eat an animal their
size?

4301
03:29:24,280 --> 03:29:27,070
I Dunno.
That sucker did not a whole lot.

4302
03:29:27,250 --> 03:29:28,210
That sucker did.

4303
03:29:30,730 --> 03:29:34,900
Mine was the size of a dinner plate.
Unless that kid is a pixie himself.

4304
03:29:35,800 --> 03:29:38,170
No,
we're looking at as a young man,

4305
03:29:38,171 --> 03:29:41,530
my lips like was this big.
That little fella looks like he's about

4306
03:29:41,531 --> 03:29:43,780
seven years old.
This is an African bull frog.

4307
03:29:43,781 --> 03:29:45,430
What it is,
it's a Pixie.

4308
03:29:46,670 --> 03:29:50,410
This is how big my frog was.
We're holding John Dudley's holding us a

4309
03:29:50,411 --> 03:29:52,570
typical ice tray that you would get in a
hotel room.

4310
03:29:52,630 --> 03:29:56,380
I would call it ice buckets rather
rabbit.

4311
03:29:57,040 --> 03:29:59,920
Oh my God.
Look at the size of that rabbit might be

4312
03:29:59,921 --> 03:30:01,060
a small girl.
No,

4313
03:30:01,080 --> 03:30:03,430
it was a big rabbit.
I could tell by his feet.

4314
03:30:03,550 --> 03:30:07,540
Go to it doesn't look right.
It took a second look at them all.

4315
03:30:07,600 --> 03:30:08,920
Oh yeah.
That's another one.

4316
03:30:08,921 --> 03:30:12,580
Eating a rat to their monsters.
I had a lot of videos in mine.

4317
03:30:12,581 --> 03:30:15,850
Just smoke in mice.
That's crazy to think that it can

4318
03:30:15,880 --> 03:30:17,380
literally eat something at the same
time.

4319
03:30:17,440 --> 03:30:19,720
They were so it was a full fucking
python.

4320
03:30:19,721 --> 03:30:22,240
They found in Florida,
in the everglades,

4321
03:30:22,390 --> 03:30:27,390
that Ada deer,
110% I think I saw that.

4322
03:30:27,611 --> 03:30:29,740
What have you,
assholes done?

4323
03:30:30,040 --> 03:30:35,040
You fucking Leonard skinner,
loving muscle car driving dip shits keep

4324
03:30:35,911 --> 03:30:40,911
a pythons and a fucking terrarium in
your bedroom with Motley crue posters on

4325
03:30:41,361 --> 03:30:44,420
the wall and you'd do acid.
Decided that that that they go in your

4326
03:30:44,421 --> 03:30:47,810
yard.
Now they're eating deer that are 111

4327
03:30:47,811 --> 03:30:50,120
pounds.
They're fucking huge man.

4328
03:30:50,590 --> 03:30:53,030
Leave that day.
Jesus Christ.

4329
03:30:54,440 --> 03:30:58,100
Oh my God,
it's so big.

4330
03:30:58,400 --> 03:31:00,630
This thing is so big.
This guy's holding onto it is,

4331
03:31:00,650 --> 03:31:02,420
is that a biologist that's got it?

4332
03:31:04,440 --> 03:31:08,600
He's holding on to the mouth and the
head controlling the body and inside of

4333
03:31:08,601 --> 03:31:12,350
it is this enormous lump that is
apparently a deer that's bigger than

4334
03:31:12,351 --> 03:31:14,780
it's a whole body in terms of his body
weight.

4335
03:31:14,960 --> 03:31:17,720
Do you ever see them one more one died
because it was trying to eat an

4336
03:31:17,721 --> 03:31:19,490
alligator.
He received that one.

4337
03:31:19,520 --> 03:31:23,870
I think so dude.
This is how gangster pythons are.

4338
03:31:24,050 --> 03:31:25,940
They are a gangster,
alligators.

4339
03:31:25,970 --> 03:31:29,770
Anything that can unlock its jaw is
pretty gangster dude.

4340
03:31:29,800 --> 03:31:32,210
They fuck with alligators.
They look at an alligator and they go,

4341
03:31:33,440 --> 03:31:35,450
I'm going to just try to eat you.
I saw,

4342
03:31:35,690 --> 03:31:39,740
I actually went to a comedy skit at
Riviera memory where you're talking

4343
03:31:39,741 --> 03:31:40,670
about that.
Look at this thing,

4344
03:31:40,671 --> 03:31:42,430
dude,
I don't interrupt a little bit,

4345
03:31:42,770 --> 03:31:44,720
but go,
go to the upper left upper left corner.

4346
03:31:44,750 --> 03:31:46,970
You get the best example.
This is what happened.

4347
03:31:46,971 --> 03:31:50,600
It died because the alligator blew out
the side of his asshole.

4348
03:31:50,820 --> 03:31:52,230
What?
I try to eat this thing,

4349
03:31:52,520 --> 03:31:54,410
I mean,
this literally happened.

4350
03:31:54,800 --> 03:31:59,510
It literally swallowed up this fucking
hole alligator face first,

4351
03:31:59,600 --> 03:32:04,370
and the alligator backed it's way out of
its asshole and they both died in the

4352
03:32:04,371 --> 03:32:07,880
everglades.
But there's this fucking snake is so

4353
03:32:07,881 --> 03:32:10,550
big,
it's trying to eat an alligator that's

4354
03:32:10,551 --> 03:32:11,450
bigger than it.

4355
03:32:12,330 --> 03:32:13,560
Yeah.
It doesn't care.

4356
03:32:13,710 --> 03:32:14,543
These

4357
03:32:15,250 --> 03:32:18,040
crazy fucks have let these things loose

4358
03:32:18,770 --> 03:32:23,030
in the United States of America.
It's simple math that,

4359
03:32:23,031 --> 03:32:26,870
uh,
that comic that we saw at Riviera I saw

4360
03:32:27,050 --> 03:32:29,770
in the late nineties,
which I think you were there at that

4361
03:32:29,771 --> 03:32:30,950
time.
We're talking about,

4362
03:32:30,951 --> 03:32:33,330
which is kind of crazy.
Uh,

4363
03:32:33,740 --> 03:32:35,810
but he,
he has going on here.

4364
03:32:35,811 --> 03:32:37,730
Jamie,
cutting a person out of a snake.

4365
03:32:38,090 --> 03:32:39,080
Oh,
wonderful.

4366
03:32:39,340 --> 03:32:41,060
Good Times.
Timing

4367
03:32:42,830 --> 03:32:43,663
is this some place,
John,

4368
03:32:43,740 --> 03:32:47,770
the lead and fucking narrowly escaped my
train set on my train is dead.

4369
03:32:48,430 --> 03:32:51,370
Oh my God.
It is a fucking person coming out of

4370
03:32:53,910 --> 03:32:57,700
this is what you need to learn folks.
Just because you watch nature doesn't

4371
03:32:57,701 --> 03:33:00,490
mean do you know nature.
Just like if you watch porn,

4372
03:33:00,491 --> 03:33:02,170
you're not getting laid.
It's the same thing.

4373
03:33:02,800 --> 03:33:07,800
If you take anything from this podcast,
take that nature is like where you go,

4374
03:33:09,150 --> 03:33:11,330
where you go.
We were talking about BC and you,

4375
03:33:11,331 --> 03:33:15,820
you go bear hunting.
Tell the people how crazy it is up

4376
03:33:15,821 --> 03:33:17,080
there.
You're in the forest filled with

4377
03:33:17,081 --> 03:33:17,914
monsters.

4378
03:33:18,190 --> 03:33:20,680
Oh yeah.
Well they don't,

4379
03:33:20,681 --> 03:33:22,240
uh,
they don't watch the news.

4380
03:33:22,420 --> 03:33:25,330
It's all about they can't,
can I eat you?

4381
03:33:25,350 --> 03:33:25,860
Yeah.
Well,

4382
03:33:25,860 --> 03:33:28,990
pretty much like this.
My mouth is this big.

4383
03:33:28,991 --> 03:33:30,760
You're this big.
I think you can fit in it.

4384
03:33:31,330 --> 03:33:35,200
Yeah.
That's as simple as it gets that comic

4385
03:33:35,201 --> 03:33:37,440
at revere that time.
Who Was it?

4386
03:33:37,441 --> 03:33:37,980
Do we,
I don't

4387
03:33:37,980 --> 03:33:40,050
know.
I wish I knew because it was actually a

4388
03:33:40,051 --> 03:33:42,030
good rules are a really good bid.
He said.

4389
03:33:42,950 --> 03:33:43,790
Yeah,
he,

4390
03:33:43,810 --> 03:33:47,060
he pretty much talked about uh,
the fact that he,

4391
03:33:47,061 --> 03:33:49,480
you know,
he's so sick of people getting uh,

4392
03:33:49,500 --> 03:33:52,710
complaining about how fast they get
because he said,

4393
03:33:52,740 --> 03:33:55,380
you know,
literally it's simple math people.

4394
03:33:55,530 --> 03:34:00,000
Your mouth is this big.
Your butt holes this big.

4395
03:34:01,720 --> 03:34:06,360
At some point there's a bottleneck.
And he just said,

4396
03:34:07,380 --> 03:34:10,320
he said between your mouth and you're in
your asshole.

4397
03:34:11,260 --> 03:34:12,690
It wasn't,
it wasn't don my rare,

4398
03:34:12,691 --> 03:34:15,120
well I don't know.
It was so long ago.

4399
03:34:15,121 --> 03:34:17,670
I mean it was 20 years ago at most.
That sounds like something.

4400
03:34:17,680 --> 03:34:19,470
Dot Marrero.
Say he just said,

4401
03:34:19,471 --> 03:34:20,640
listen,
it's simple math.

4402
03:34:20,760 --> 03:34:23,790
That's your mouth.
Is this big butt holes this big?

4403
03:34:24,420 --> 03:34:26,580
Yeah.
Why are you complaining about being fat?

4404
03:34:26,670 --> 03:34:28,410
Well,
that's the real concept behind that.

4405
03:34:28,440 --> 03:34:30,120
Um,
16 hour fasting.

4406
03:34:30,690 --> 03:34:33,060
You know,
Eddie Bravo in your mouth.

4407
03:34:33,540 --> 03:34:37,050
I was doing 14 for a while,
but Eddie said that it's 16 is really

4408
03:34:37,051 --> 03:34:38,720
where all the benefits happen.
So all right,

4409
03:34:38,730 --> 03:34:42,090
I'll give it a try.
So I tried 16 and a I see it.

4410
03:34:42,270 --> 03:34:44,940
There's definitely something to it.
There's more alertness.

4411
03:34:45,150 --> 03:34:46,830
Um,
I processed food better.

4412
03:34:47,070 --> 03:34:51,750
I think giving your body a smaller
window to process food is really wise.

4413
03:34:51,990 --> 03:34:54,960
I think it also,
it aids you because it gives you

4414
03:34:54,961 --> 03:34:57,090
discipline.
Just even just a little discipline.

4415
03:34:57,091 --> 03:34:59,220
It's just a baby baby amount of
discipline.

4416
03:34:59,490 --> 03:35:00,870
But it's a no,
it's a lot.

4417
03:35:00,960 --> 03:35:02,580
It's not,
it's not really to me and you,

4418
03:35:02,581 --> 03:35:05,580
it's not,
but just some people that is seriously,

4419
03:35:05,610 --> 03:35:07,860
but it's all relative.
But I'm just being honest with them.

4420
03:35:07,861 --> 03:35:09,150
If they just,
they need to get past that.

4421
03:35:09,151 --> 03:35:11,280
It's not really a lot,
but the benefits of it,

4422
03:35:11,281 --> 03:35:13,560
like how you feel when you finally have
your first meal.

4423
03:35:13,560 --> 03:35:16,170
When you cross over the line,
like you feel better and your body works

4424
03:35:16,171 --> 03:35:18,820
better and you have more energy.
That's a fact I have for you.

4425
03:35:18,830 --> 03:35:21,780
Absorb it faster.
You and I both are big.

4426
03:35:21,900 --> 03:35:25,290
Fasters I th I mean I fast.
Um,

4427
03:35:25,380 --> 03:35:30,380
I normally eat last maybe about seven
o'clock at night and then I normally

4428
03:35:31,531 --> 03:35:36,531
eating in about 10 or so in the morning.
So I mean it's,

4429
03:35:37,110 --> 03:35:39,750
it's quite a bit of time.
And when I eat,

4430
03:35:40,050 --> 03:35:45,050
I legitimately feel like I can feel my
body absorbing everything that I'm

4431
03:35:45,901 --> 03:35:46,940
consuming.
Right.

4432
03:35:46,980 --> 03:35:48,630
Like it's processed.
Everything else.

4433
03:35:48,930 --> 03:35:51,720
That's how it's supposed to be.
I mean that's really what fat is all

4434
03:35:51,721 --> 03:35:52,440
about,
right?

4435
03:35:52,440 --> 03:35:55,020
Fat Is all about you just keep
stockpiling.

4436
03:35:55,170 --> 03:35:56,970
Even though your body hasn't processed
is like,

4437
03:35:56,971 --> 03:35:58,950
I don't even want to put,
I'll put it over here and your body's

4438
03:35:58,951 --> 03:36:02,230
like stacking up fat over your body
instead of utilizing it for fuel.

4439
03:36:02,230 --> 03:36:04,140
You're just not burning off enough
calories.

4440
03:36:04,210 --> 03:36:05,850
Yup.
You know that is,

4441
03:36:05,910 --> 03:36:10,380
that's what this whole fasting thing
sort of normalize this for me at least.

4442
03:36:10,620 --> 03:36:12,540
It just gives you this opportunity where
your body says,

4443
03:36:12,541 --> 03:36:14,700
let's just digest everything we got
here.

4444
03:36:14,850 --> 03:36:17,100
Let's just do this,
and then when there's dude wakes up in

4445
03:36:17,101 --> 03:36:19,530
the morning,
would it be burning fats is the way to

4446
03:36:19,531 --> 03:36:21,810
go and then you feel good.
You have more energy.

4447
03:36:21,840 --> 03:36:24,480
Body is using ketones,
especially if you're like someone like

4448
03:36:24,481 --> 03:36:26,250
myself that I'm not eating a lot of
bread.

4449
03:36:26,520 --> 03:36:28,830
If I eat bread once every two or three
weeks,

4450
03:36:28,831 --> 03:36:32,100
it's a big deal for the pasta.
Once every two or three weeks,

4451
03:36:32,101 --> 03:36:34,380
it's a big deal.
Do you feel like dog shit when you do?

4452
03:36:34,560 --> 03:36:35,440
No.
No,

4453
03:36:35,441 --> 03:36:39,040
but I don't go crazy.
I don't go crazy if I don't go crazy.

4454
03:36:39,041 --> 03:36:39,874
I don't feel bad.

4455
03:36:40,300 --> 03:36:43,810
But if I do go crazy,
if I eat like a big piece of chocolate

4456
03:36:43,811 --> 03:36:46,690
cake and some ice cream,
I feel it way more now.

4457
03:36:46,870 --> 03:36:50,380
Way more now.
I think you're more in tune if you're,

4458
03:36:51,160 --> 03:36:54,520
if you're conscious about it,
I think you have a better understanding

4459
03:36:54,521 --> 03:36:57,970
of what it actually does to you.
That's a problem with people that are in

4460
03:36:57,971 --> 03:37:02,170
the lifestyle of doing every single day
is they don't really realize what it's

4461
03:37:02,171 --> 03:37:03,760
doing to them.
I think there's that.

4462
03:37:03,761 --> 03:37:06,380
But I think there's also obviously a
tolerance that you develop.

4463
03:37:06,381 --> 03:37:08,590
Just like people develop a tolerance for
alcohol.

4464
03:37:08,800 --> 03:37:12,760
People develop a tolerance for weed.
People definitely I think develop a

4465
03:37:12,761 --> 03:37:14,980
tolerance for sugar.
And when I don't have it,

4466
03:37:14,981 --> 03:37:17,800
then I feel the full brunt of sugar.
And it's like I remember,

4467
03:37:18,310 --> 03:37:21,610
um,
I took my family to get cheeseburgers

4468
03:37:21,611 --> 03:37:26,611
and milkshakes and I had a big ass
fucking vanilla milkshake and it was so

4469
03:37:27,491 --> 03:37:28,324
good.

4470
03:37:28,420 --> 03:37:31,780
Oh my God,
I was drinking this big ass like 20

4471
03:37:31,781 --> 03:37:36,781
ounce vanilla milkshake and I was eating
this cheeseburger and I hit the wall so

4472
03:37:36,881 --> 03:37:39,930
hard after it was over I had a sit down
like a bike.

4473
03:37:39,940 --> 03:37:42,580
What kind of bitch in mind that I'm,
I'm getting taken out.

4474
03:37:42,581 --> 03:37:46,150
I get like hamstring buy a cheeseburger
and a milkshake,

4475
03:37:46,300 --> 03:37:51,160
but it was just clearly that I've been
eating clean for so long.

4476
03:37:51,161 --> 03:37:54,460
My body had no idea what to do with that
giant dump of sugar.

4477
03:37:55,180 --> 03:37:59,800
How much sugar do you think is in 20
ounces or 18 and I don't know how much

4478
03:37:59,801 --> 03:38:02,890
it was like one of those,
you know those Sunday drink things that

4479
03:38:02,891 --> 03:38:05,400
give you a where it's a big ass.
Oh God.

4480
03:38:05,920 --> 03:38:09,730
Glass fill.
Which ice cream milkshake today I was in

4481
03:38:09,731 --> 03:38:14,710
the airport in De Moines and I got a
coffee hundred grams.

4482
03:38:15,220 --> 03:38:16,150
Oh my God.

4483
03:38:16,360 --> 03:38:18,970
20 ounce chocolate shake.
Nutrition information.

4484
03:38:20,020 --> 03:38:22,360
How many tablespoons is that?
100.

4485
03:38:22,630 --> 03:38:25,060
How many tablespoons is a hundred oh my
god,

4486
03:38:25,061 --> 03:38:27,940
it's so crazy.
It was in de Moines airport this

4487
03:38:27,940 --> 03:38:30,130
morning.
I got a coffee and a guy behind me

4488
03:38:30,131 --> 03:38:31,870
getting a coffee.
He was like,

4489
03:38:31,930 --> 03:38:35,110
I think he was a baggage handler for one
of the airlines.

4490
03:38:36,130 --> 03:38:40,390
I literally came up and I poured nothing
but half and half in my coffee.

4491
03:38:40,960 --> 03:38:43,930
I'm a big,
I actually feel like I thrive off fat

4492
03:38:43,960 --> 03:38:44,770
now,
right,

4493
03:38:44,770 --> 03:38:49,770
because that's what my body wants.
He unscrewed the top of the jar of meth?

4494
03:38:51,370 --> 03:38:52,860
No.
Yeah,

4495
03:38:52,900 --> 03:38:57,550
pretty much.
He unscrewed the top off the sugar and

4496
03:38:57,551 --> 03:38:59,920
he started,
I was actually like,

4497
03:39:00,040 --> 03:39:00,851
God,
dude,

4498
03:39:00,851 --> 03:39:02,920
can you do that again so I can video
this?

4499
03:39:03,430 --> 03:39:08,430
He unscrewed the top off the sugar and
started pouring his coffee and he poured

4500
03:39:08,681 --> 03:39:10,420
and I was like,
oh my God,

4501
03:39:10,421 --> 03:39:13,270
is that a lot?
And then he kept going and kept going

4502
03:39:13,271 --> 03:39:17,050
and kept going and then he tipped the
thing down,

4503
03:39:17,051 --> 03:39:22,051
put the top back on the sugar and then
poured in fricking creamer and I was,

4504
03:39:23,620 --> 03:39:25,480
I was sitting there like,
dude,

4505
03:39:25,720 --> 03:39:27,790
that is,
it's rich.

4506
03:39:27,850 --> 03:39:32,850
It's literally like two or three times
what you're saying and the problem

4507
03:39:34,010 --> 03:39:39,010
is this guy that was half my size needed
that to feel like he could get the day

4508
03:39:39,801 --> 03:39:42,110
going or it's a big,
that's a big problem.

4509
03:39:42,111 --> 03:39:45,380
His job so bad.
They just wanted to go into a diabetic

4510
03:39:45,381 --> 03:39:48,860
coma in the middle of the fucking middle
of the work floor.

4511
03:39:49,160 --> 03:39:50,150
He's just like,
look,

4512
03:39:50,270 --> 03:39:53,270
fuck this insulin.
I'm just eating about a half a pound of

4513
03:39:53,271 --> 03:39:55,040
sugar.
Let's do this.

4514
03:39:55,470 --> 03:39:58,160
Okay.
I love it.

4515
03:39:58,161 --> 03:40:01,220
It's got myself wet.
What's that?

4516
03:40:01,310 --> 03:40:02,143
No,
it's okay.

4517
03:40:02,150 --> 03:40:03,830
It's just my pants.
It's just this.

4518
03:40:03,920 --> 03:40:06,500
Nothing about jeans.
My barbell jeans are wet.

4519
03:40:06,501 --> 03:40:07,760
Look,
embarrassment.

4520
03:40:08,060 --> 03:40:10,160
Listen,
this is for your own good ladies and

4521
03:40:10,161 --> 03:40:11,750
gentlemen.
It's for comedy.

4522
03:40:12,530 --> 03:40:14,540
It is.
We're okay though.

4523
03:40:14,720 --> 03:40:15,560
No computer.
No.

4524
03:40:15,561 --> 03:40:20,100
How many tablespoons of sugars in a
hundred grants.

4525
03:40:20,990 --> 03:40:25,990
When I think of a hundred grams,
I'm thinking like a baseball of sugar.

4526
03:40:27,080 --> 03:40:28,400
That's what I think.
It's a lot.

4527
03:40:28,580 --> 03:40:30,860
A major league baseball of sugar.

4528
03:40:31,910 --> 03:40:32,960
Does that make sense?
Yeah,

4529
03:40:33,380 --> 03:40:34,790
for sure.
Is that legit?

4530
03:40:35,150 --> 03:40:37,970
Can I see like a physical representation
of 100 grams of sugar?

4531
03:40:38,000 --> 03:40:42,750
One tablespoon equals 12 grams.
That's eight.

4532
03:40:44,400 --> 03:40:48,560
Eight and a half.
That's so crazy.

4533
03:40:48,561 --> 03:40:51,050
What does that look like?
Quite a baseball.

4534
03:40:51,110 --> 03:40:54,000
It's a baseball because in baseball,
Huh?

4535
03:40:54,230 --> 03:40:56,450
Eight and a half.
Eight and a half is bigger than a golf

4536
03:40:56,451 --> 03:40:56,811
ball.
That's,

4537
03:40:56,811 --> 03:40:59,060
I'm just being conservative.
How many golf balls?

4538
03:40:59,180 --> 03:41:01,100
One Kiwi.
Two.

4539
03:41:01,101 --> 03:41:04,220
Three.
I bet it's two golf balls,

4540
03:41:04,730 --> 03:41:06,710
Jamie.
Whoa,

4541
03:41:07,640 --> 03:41:11,270
that's a lot.
If you got damn fault nor did that,

4542
03:41:12,440 --> 03:41:14,760
you'd be on cloud.
Nine seconds.

4543
03:41:15,230 --> 03:41:17,630
Look at that corridor just to get
proportion.

4544
03:41:17,660 --> 03:41:19,760
That's crazy.
Holy Nuggets.

4545
03:41:20,060 --> 03:41:22,940
That's all are you fucking know?
No wonder why it hits a wall.

4546
03:41:23,180 --> 03:41:25,640
Cups.
Paris.

4547
03:41:25,970 --> 03:41:28,840
There's a hundred grams right here.
I think it's comparing a hundred grams.

4548
03:41:29,430 --> 03:41:30,340
Two Cups.
Oh,

4549
03:41:30,370 --> 03:41:32,080
there's two gaps.
So it's one cup,

4550
03:41:32,380 --> 03:41:35,470
one cup the size of the hundred grams.
That's nuts.

4551
03:41:35,590 --> 03:41:37,870
That's so much sugar.
And that's what's in a milkshake.

4552
03:41:39,230 --> 03:41:43,210
I got to go to the doctor 10 years ago,
but I still have to go to the doctor

4553
03:41:43,211 --> 03:41:45,310
today because of it.
Um,

4554
03:41:45,340 --> 03:41:47,110
let's wrap this up.
I going to pee again.

4555
03:41:48,190 --> 03:41:50,320
It's already four o'clock.
Let's shoot some arrows.

4556
03:41:52,090 --> 03:41:53,080

03:41:57,140 --> 03:42:01,160
knock on podcasts.
You can go to a itunes.

4559
03:42:01,161 --> 03:42:03,290
You get it on Google play.
It's on.

4560
03:42:03,470 --> 03:42:05,510
Is it on Google?
Play stitcher,

4561
03:42:05,570 --> 03:42:07,540
stitcher.

Knock on archery.com it's the best.

4563
03:42:13,040 --> 03:42:15,320
What's the instagram though?
Knock on TV.

4564
03:42:15,500 --> 03:42:16,640
Knock on TV.

4565
03:42:16,641 --> 03:42:18,770
Knock on TV.
A twitter as well.

4566
03:42:19,790 --> 03:42:21,520
I Dunno,
I don't tweet much.

4567
03:42:21,521 --> 03:42:24,110
He doesn't tweet marriage.
Just check them out on instagram.

4568
03:42:24,950 --> 03:42:26,000
We're done,
ladies and gentlemen.

4569
03:42:26,120 --> 03:42:28,460
We did about a fuck fucking 15 hour
podcasts.

4570
03:42:28,461 --> 03:42:30,930
How long was that for hours.
That's my,

4571
03:42:30,960 --> 03:42:32,130
that's enough.
You've

4572
03:42:32,130 --> 03:42:33,720
heard enough.
We loved you.

4573
03:42:33,721 --> 03:42:36,210
Bladders may love these people.
Love these people.

4574
03:42:36,211 --> 03:42:39,230
John Dudley,

4575
03:42:39,720 --> 03:42:41,460
Tell these people you love them.
I love you.

4576
03:42:41,461 --> 03:42:44,050
Freaks.
Bye.

4577
03:42:46,880 --> 03:42:47,240
Awesome.
