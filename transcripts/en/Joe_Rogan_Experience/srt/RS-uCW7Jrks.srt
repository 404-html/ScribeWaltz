1
00:00:02,790 --> 00:00:04,560
Five,
four,

2
00:00:04,590 --> 00:00:05,540
three,
two.

3
00:00:05,550 --> 00:00:06,450
Oh,
what's happened?

4
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:09,690
Jamie went through Joseph.
How are you?

5
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:10,740
What's going on?
Doing good.

6
00:00:10,770 --> 00:00:11,760
How you doing?
Good.

7
00:00:11,790 --> 00:00:13,260
Welcome.
Thank you for having me.

8
00:00:13,290 --> 00:00:14,310
Thanks for coming on.
You.

9
00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:15,353
You wrote an article and I tweet.
Let me tell you about my chiropractic 

10
00:00:17,911 --> 00:00:18,744
journey.
Um,

11
00:00:19,590 --> 00:00:22,880
I had a podcast that I did with my 
friend Steve Rinella a few weeks back at

12
00:00:22,881 --> 00:00:23,714
Ya.
And he has a brother that has a 

13
00:00:24,690 --> 00:00:25,523
herniated disc real bad and he's got a 
atrophy in one of his arms because he's 

14
00:00:28,951 --> 00:00:31,320
got a push nerve and you know,
the whole thing.

15
00:00:31,350 --> 00:00:33,270
Bulging disc.
Not Good.

16
00:00:33,271 --> 00:00:34,540
Yeah.
And uh,

17
00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:36,360
we got to talk and I said,
look,

18
00:00:36,361 --> 00:00:37,194
that guy's got to do something about it 
right away because the more time you 

19
00:00:39,361 --> 00:00:40,194
spend with an atrophied arm,
the longer it takes to rehabilitate 

20
00:00:42,841 --> 00:00:43,674
that.
And it's a pretty common injury with 

21
00:00:45,361 --> 00:00:46,290
martial artists.

22
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:51,600
Get get yourself to a physical therapist
right away and get an Mri.

23
00:00:51,630 --> 00:00:56,130
And then spinal decompression the whole 
deal and see whatever science based.

24
00:00:56,131 --> 00:00:57,360
Absolutely.
So he goes,

25
00:00:57,630 --> 00:00:59,450
what do you think about chiropractors?
And I go,

26
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:03,000
so I say,
I think chiropractors are bullshit.

27
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:04,270
And then,
uh,

28
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:05,071
he goes,
really?

29
00:01:05,071 --> 00:01:05,671
I go,
yeah,

30
00:01:05,671 --> 00:01:08,850
I go,
I've just had bad experiences with it.

31
00:01:08,851 --> 00:01:10,890
And then I've read some things about it 
being bullshit.

32
00:01:11,250 --> 00:01:14,670
And then I got home after the podcast 
and I smoked a joint.

33
00:01:14,940 --> 00:01:16,630
And a lot of times when I spoke to Paul 
on,

34
00:01:16,650 --> 00:01:21,650
I feel bad about some of the things that
I've said rarely do.

35
00:01:22,490 --> 00:01:23,400
It's I,
I,

36
00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:25,740
I smoked more than the average 
scientist.

37
00:01:25,990 --> 00:01:28,410
My boyfriend is a director of r and D at
a pot lab.

38
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:29,333
Oh,
there is some pot kicking around on a 

39
00:01:33,541 --> 00:01:36,450
regular basis while we get it free from 
a bunch of people.

40
00:01:36,450 --> 00:01:39,540
I have to tell people at shows and no 
disrespect to people that offer to me.

41
00:01:39,541 --> 00:01:40,830
I'm like,
please don't give me any pot.

42
00:01:41,430 --> 00:01:43,140
I can't take your.
I have too much pot.

43
00:01:43,850 --> 00:01:45,840
Wait,
we have a similar problem.

44
00:01:46,660 --> 00:01:47,820
Um,
so anyway,

45
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:49,620
I smoke the pot and then I go,
God,

46
00:01:49,650 --> 00:01:50,483
maybe I'm a dick.
Maybe that was rude saying because I 

47
00:01:52,321 --> 00:01:54,930
know people that are chiropractors and I
know they're nice people and I know they

48
00:01:54,931 --> 00:01:55,890
mean well.
And I'm like,

49
00:01:56,190 --> 00:01:58,620
maybe I'm a dick.
I think they mean,

50
00:01:58,621 --> 00:01:59,640
well,
some of them,

51
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:01,560
sure,
I think they're wrong,

52
00:02:01,561 --> 00:02:03,090
but they mean well,
so,

53
00:02:03,091 --> 00:02:05,460
um,
I go maybe I was being a dick.

54
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:06,473
So then I Google chiropractic and then I
started reading and I spend hours and 

55
00:02:12,930 --> 00:02:17,910
hours reading about the history of cut.
I'm going to say this in big air quotes,

56
00:02:17,940 --> 00:02:21,210
chiropractic medicine.
Go,

57
00:02:21,270 --> 00:02:25,170
holy fucking shit.
Not only do I not feel bad now,

58
00:02:25,171 --> 00:02:26,004
now I'm angry about it and this is to 
all you people and I've got a ton of 

59
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:36,090
messages from chiropractors that I'm 
sure nice folks and they're really upset

60
00:02:36,091 --> 00:02:38,280
because they liked this podcast and 
they're like,

61
00:02:38,281 --> 00:02:38,810
you know,
you're,

62
00:02:38,810 --> 00:02:40,290
you're shitting on my business.

63
00:02:40,290 --> 00:02:43,460
And you said you have to understand 
it's,

64
00:02:43,740 --> 00:02:45,560
I'm sure a lot of you are.
Meanwhile,

65
00:02:45,630 --> 00:02:46,980
I'm sure a lot of you do.
Well,

66
00:02:46,981 --> 00:02:50,400
I'm sure a lot of you try really hard to
help your patients and I'm sure a lot of

67
00:02:50,401 --> 00:02:54,540
you incorporate a lot of other stuff 
like massage,

68
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:58,980
cold laser and real science into your 
therapies.

69
00:02:59,260 --> 00:03:00,160
But the

70
00:03:00,350 --> 00:03:02,140
origination,
the origin,

71
00:03:02,170 --> 00:03:03,003
the original guy who created 
chiropractic medicine was a complete 

72
00:03:07,060 --> 00:03:10,570
total bullshit artists fucking whack 
just guy right here.

73
00:03:10,850 --> 00:03:13,030
This,
this character Daniel,

74
00:03:13,031 --> 00:03:13,864
David Palmer.
So it started as a magnetic healer in 

75
00:03:17,201 --> 00:03:18,430
Davenport,
Iowa.

76
00:03:19,140 --> 00:03:21,940
I mean the whole thing is hundred 
percent horseshit.

77
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:25,400
This article that we wrote,
we sent this through A.

78
00:03:25,420 --> 00:03:26,253
I mean,
normally my articles I go through at 

79
00:03:27,131 --> 00:03:29,230
least two editors,
give or take this one,

80
00:03:29,231 --> 00:03:31,030
we put through,
I believe three editors,

81
00:03:31,031 --> 00:03:31,864
a fact checker and our lawyer to make 
sure that we were bulletproof on it 

82
00:03:34,601 --> 00:03:36,550
because we wanted to make sure that we 
know that,

83
00:03:36,700 --> 00:03:37,533
that we didn't say anything that could 
get sued basically in a lot of the 

84
00:03:40,271 --> 00:03:43,120
information from this came directly from
his book,

85
00:03:43,121 --> 00:03:43,954
from his own book.
So we weren't taking anything out of 

86
00:03:46,571 --> 00:03:47,404
context.
One of the quotes on how chiropractic 

87
00:03:49,721 --> 00:03:53,380
started came directly from the book and 
he after,

88
00:03:53,381 --> 00:03:55,410
um,
after cracking a,

89
00:03:55,420 --> 00:04:00,420
a half deaf persons or a deaf person's 
telling Jamie just had pulled up in that

90
00:04:01,060 --> 00:04:02,260
article,
pull it back up,

91
00:04:02,261 --> 00:04:02,530
Jamie.

92
00:04:02,530 --> 00:04:06,280
So you could see that he claimed that he
cracked a deaf person's back.

93
00:04:06,340 --> 00:04:08,740
And restorative healing or his hearing 
now,

94
00:04:08,741 --> 00:04:10,390
a couple of things could have happened 
here.

95
00:04:10,660 --> 00:04:11,493
Either one,
there was no actual medical consent 

96
00:04:13,121 --> 00:04:15,460
given because this person was def.
Uh,

97
00:04:15,461 --> 00:04:17,110
so I'm not sure how,
uh,

98
00:04:17,140 --> 00:04:17,973
how that came about too.
He didn't actually restore the hearing 

99
00:04:20,801 --> 00:04:23,860
because there are no nerves in the spine
connected to your hearing.

100
00:04:24,140 --> 00:04:25,200
Uh,
or you know,

101
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:27,130
three,
this guy is just lying.

102
00:04:27,540 --> 00:04:28,420
There are a couple,
you know,

103
00:04:28,421 --> 00:04:30,910
and we're not sure what happened,
but he,

104
00:04:30,940 --> 00:04:33,070
like,
there are still in Chiropractic,

105
00:04:33,071 --> 00:04:33,904
could have done a few things with this.
They could have disavowed what happened 

106
00:04:35,981 --> 00:04:36,431
and said,
you know,

107
00:04:36,431 --> 00:04:37,264
we still have a system by which we can 
really try to relieve pain through 

108
00:04:39,671 --> 00:04:41,350
spinal manipulation.
But no,

109
00:04:41,351 --> 00:04:42,184
there are still articles out today from 
chiropractors today that try to claim 

110
00:04:46,661 --> 00:04:49,750
that yes indeed he did restore hearing 
because I was like,

111
00:04:49,751 --> 00:04:49,990
no.

112
00:04:49,990 --> 00:04:50,823
Could you guys just maybe back down on 
some of the nuttier claims because 

113
00:04:53,441 --> 00:04:54,520
there,
there is some,

114
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:58,540
some minor evidence that you can relieve
back pain,

115
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:00,760
lower back pain with spinal 
manipulation.

116
00:05:00,761 --> 00:05:03,610
And there are,
there are a Kairos that are trying to be

117
00:05:03,611 --> 00:05:04,444
science based with this,
but the history of it is so ridiculous 

118
00:05:07,211 --> 00:05:10,480
and they try to back down on nothing and
that's not how science works.

119
00:05:10,481 --> 00:05:11,314
Science works with the newest evidence 
and it tries to figure out what's real 

120
00:05:14,741 --> 00:05:15,574
and what's not and they try to double 
down on all the craziest stuff and I 

121
00:05:19,631 --> 00:05:22,840
think there are Kairos that are trying 
to fix the field maybe and say,

122
00:05:22,841 --> 00:05:23,674
you know,
spinal manipulation can help with back 

123
00:05:25,541 --> 00:05:27,500
pain,
but that's not what this claims.

124
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:28,353
It claims that you can fix everything in
the body through these vertebral 

125
00:05:31,151 --> 00:05:34,660
subluxations that have never been shown 
what is a subluxation?

126
00:05:34,870 --> 00:05:36,550
So there are a couple,
there's,

127
00:05:36,570 --> 00:05:40,150
there are two terms being used here and 
chiropractic uses it incorrectly.

128
00:05:40,151 --> 00:05:43,210
And in medicine we use it correctly.
So a subluxation,

129
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:46,750
the actual medical term means that a 
joint pops out halfway.

130
00:05:46,751 --> 00:05:47,584
So you have a dislocation was which is a
complete separation of a joint 

131
00:05:50,711 --> 00:05:51,544
basically.
And a subluxation is a partial 

132
00:05:53,411 --> 00:05:54,244
dislocation.
I know because they happened to my 

133
00:05:55,631 --> 00:05:57,590
shoulder there.
There are a fun party trick.

134
00:05:57,620 --> 00:06:02,390
I'll spare you a but of subluxation in 
the chiropractic sense.

135
00:06:02,391 --> 00:06:04,880
They use this medical term kind of 
incorrectly.

136
00:06:04,881 --> 00:06:08,720
They say that your spine can be somewhat
out of joint basically,

137
00:06:08,721 --> 00:06:09,554
and it causes all your health problems,
like your pancreas is malfunctioning 

138
00:06:12,621 --> 00:06:16,520
because your spine is out of alignment 
and it's never been proven to happen and

139
00:06:16,521 --> 00:06:17,354
they claim that they can put you into a 
state of health by massaging your back 

140
00:06:22,071 --> 00:06:22,330
and it.

141
00:06:22,330 --> 00:06:23,163
Here's what's important about this.
This was created out of thin air by a 

142
00:06:26,841 --> 00:06:27,674
guy who was a quack.
The origin is not based on years and 

143
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:34,010
years of medical research.
None of this.

144
00:06:34,011 --> 00:06:34,844
All of this came from the 18 hundreds 
from a guy who was completely full of 

145
00:06:37,881 --> 00:06:40,070
shit and he was.
He was a magnetic healer.

146
00:06:40,071 --> 00:06:41,620
Now,
magnetic healing,

147
00:06:41,780 --> 00:06:42,613
you can still see at the store these 
little like knee braces that have 

148
00:06:45,291 --> 00:06:48,260
magnets and a guys save your money.
Just get a regular old knee brace.

149
00:06:48,261 --> 00:06:49,094
If you feel any,
any relief from one of those magnetic 

150
00:06:51,531 --> 00:06:53,030
braces.
It's just from the brace.

151
00:06:53,031 --> 00:06:55,680
It's not the fucking magnet.
Yeah,

152
00:06:55,910 --> 00:06:59,120
exactly.
Placebo effects or the placebo effect is

153
00:06:59,121 --> 00:07:01,730
a real thing.
You can get some relief from that,

154
00:07:01,731 --> 00:07:02,564
but don't bother,
which may also account for some of the 

155
00:07:04,401 --> 00:07:06,920
pain relief from chiropractic medicine.
Absolutely.

156
00:07:06,921 --> 00:07:07,754
I mean they're doing exactly like 
they're doing some massage along with 

157
00:07:10,941 --> 00:07:11,774
what they're doing and some of them 
problem because massage actually helps 

158
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:15,073
and there there are studies that show 
people who go to a massage therapist or 

159
00:07:18,981 --> 00:07:23,580
massage practitioner tend to get more 
relief than people who go to a,

160
00:07:23,650 --> 00:07:24,590
to a chiropractor.

161
00:07:24,590 --> 00:07:27,740
So please go to a massage therapist,
go to a,

162
00:07:27,741 --> 00:07:29,270
uh,
to a physical therapist.

163
00:07:29,271 --> 00:07:30,104
Those are,
those are your science based 

164
00:07:31,610 --> 00:07:33,110
practitioners.
Chiropractic.

165
00:07:33,260 --> 00:07:36,710
It started out of bullshit and it's 
stayed directly in bullshit.

166
00:07:37,730 --> 00:07:42,730
Like there's no reason that anybody 
would have from this guy,

167
00:07:43,011 --> 00:07:45,440
from this one original guy who created 
it.

168
00:07:45,441 --> 00:07:49,220
This guy was a magnetic healer who came 
up with this somehow or another,

169
00:07:49,221 --> 00:07:52,310
it's slipped through the cracks and 
that's what this is.

170
00:07:52,340 --> 00:07:53,173
I mean,
they're running around calling 

171
00:07:53,631 --> 00:07:55,380
themselves.
Doctors say,

172
00:07:55,490 --> 00:07:58,020
this guy said to me,
one of these guys who got angry at me,

173
00:07:58,040 --> 00:07:58,873
I've,
I've gotten at least two dozen maybe 

174
00:08:00,890 --> 00:08:03,470
angry messages for rafters,
but one of them,

175
00:08:03,471 --> 00:08:06,620
the guy said,
does a podiatrist go to medical school?

176
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:08,810
Well,
the fuck they go to podiatry school.

177
00:08:08,870 --> 00:08:09,710
Not only that,
they take,

178
00:08:09,950 --> 00:08:13,250
they have a medical residency that they 
have to do for three years.

179
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:13,860
They,
they,

180
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:18,860
they actually go to a hospital to work 
in the hospital and the podiatry is like

181
00:08:19,370 --> 00:08:23,450
an actual science of studying this foot 
and some of them are.

182
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:24,313
I could be wrong on this.
Someone go ahead and please fact check 

183
00:08:25,881 --> 00:08:26,714
me.
I believe some of them are pediatric 

184
00:08:27,530 --> 00:08:28,363
surgeons,
like they have to know all the anatomy 

185
00:08:29,721 --> 00:08:32,180
of the feet in order to treat actual 
foot conditions.

186
00:08:32,181 --> 00:08:34,820
They are like,
these are part of the medical system.

187
00:08:35,130 --> 00:08:38,860
Ca chiropractic works kind of separately
and on theories that uh,

188
00:08:38,910 --> 00:08:42,890
that have never been proven to work.
They can't even do imaging like half.

189
00:08:42,891 --> 00:08:43,724
I believe something like half of 
chiropractic clinics don't even have x 

190
00:08:46,241 --> 00:08:49,130
rays.
So how can they show you 100 percent for

191
00:08:49,131 --> 00:08:52,910
sure that what they're claiming is 
happening in your back isn't happening.

192
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:53,900
And I read,
I mean,

193
00:08:53,930 --> 00:08:57,180
these are statistics that I found 
straight from chiropractic websites,

194
00:08:57,181 --> 00:08:58,650
from their organizations.

195
00:08:58,850 --> 00:08:59,740
Um,
and I,

196
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:00,713
I had this referenced in the article,
I just am blanking on which place had 

197
00:09:03,571 --> 00:09:05,430
this,
one of the chiropractic boards that does

198
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:08,720
large scale surveys within Chiropractic,
uh,

199
00:09:08,721 --> 00:09:11,070
about half.
There were a lot of places,

200
00:09:11,071 --> 00:09:14,220
a lot of people I'm sure said to you,
but my chiropractor's good microfracture

201
00:09:14,310 --> 00:09:16,740
doesn't do the bullshit stuff and a lot 
of my friends said that too.

202
00:09:16,741 --> 00:09:18,120
They said no,
they just crack my back.

203
00:09:18,121 --> 00:09:20,220
They don't try to sell me any bullshit 
supplements.

204
00:09:20,580 --> 00:09:23,550
About half of chiropractors do the 
bullshit stuff.

205
00:09:23,551 --> 00:09:25,650
They do the extra,
the extraneous wellness stuff.

206
00:09:25,651 --> 00:09:28,020
So when,
if you have a 50,

207
00:09:28,021 --> 00:09:28,854
if you're playing Russian roulette and 
you have a 50 percent chance of getting 

208
00:09:31,771 --> 00:09:32,780
a bullshit,
uh,

209
00:09:32,810 --> 00:09:33,810
or,
or getting a bullet,

210
00:09:33,820 --> 00:09:35,070
are you going to do that?
No.

211
00:09:35,130 --> 00:09:35,963
Like that's,
I don't want a 50 percent chance of 

212
00:09:37,111 --> 00:09:39,150
having a bullshit Dr who's like,
well,

213
00:09:39,151 --> 00:09:41,310
maybe your colds really a German,
you know,

214
00:09:41,340 --> 00:09:42,240
maybe it's a bowl.

215
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:43,073
I don't want the bullshit doctor.
I want the guy who knows what he's 

216
00:09:45,241 --> 00:09:48,180
talking about and this is what you're 
getting with chiropractic.

217
00:09:48,181 --> 00:09:52,380
You're getting a bullshit doctor and 
it's even if you're not a doctor.

218
00:09:52,410 --> 00:09:53,011
Yeah,
exactly.

219
00:09:53,011 --> 00:09:55,020
Part of the problem they call themselves
doctor,

220
00:09:55,080 --> 00:10:00,080
have you seen that's so fucked up,
checking in on this.

221
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:01,860
They don't go to medical school.
It's,

222
00:10:01,861 --> 00:10:02,694
they go to,
they go to chiropractic school is now 

223
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:05,033
one of the biggest chiropractice schools
in the country is a Palmer chiropractic 

224
00:10:08,131 --> 00:10:11,790
college and that's named for DD Palmer.
The guy who launched,

225
00:10:12,030 --> 00:10:17,030
launched this bevy of bullshit on us and
he a guy named after the guy who claimed

226
00:10:17,461 --> 00:10:20,670
it heal up and it's one of one of my.
Now this is crazy.

227
00:10:20,671 --> 00:10:23,100
So we're going to be a fun story.
By Fun,

228
00:10:23,101 --> 00:10:25,830
I mean horrifying.
One of the guys I went to Undergrad with

229
00:10:26,070 --> 00:10:28,110
a went to Palmer chiropractic college.

230
00:10:28,110 --> 00:10:30,600
Now the acceptance rate,
100 percent tuition,

231
00:10:30,601 --> 00:10:33,320
$34,000 a year to learn how to crack 
babies,

232
00:10:33,321 --> 00:10:34,930
spines.
Now the guy I went to college,

233
00:10:36,050 --> 00:10:36,883
but some people do,
some of them do know it is a growing 

234
00:10:39,811 --> 00:10:43,410
field and chiropractic.
This one guy said this hilarious.

235
00:10:43,411 --> 00:10:45,030
He said,
you're saying the crack babies bonds.

236
00:10:45,031 --> 00:10:47,740
It's a gentleman emulation.
Like why?

237
00:10:47,910 --> 00:10:49,040
Yeah,
exactly the thing.

238
00:10:49,050 --> 00:10:51,570
Why?
Why the fuck are you manipulating?

239
00:10:51,620 --> 00:10:54,240
Because there's no evidence whatsoever 
that helps babies.

240
00:10:54,650 --> 00:10:56,520
The babies aren't complaining about back
pain.

241
00:10:56,580 --> 00:10:56,940
Yeah,
no.

242
00:10:56,940 --> 00:10:58,470
Here's,
here are the two things that I've heard.

243
00:10:58,471 --> 00:10:59,304
One is,
uh,

244
00:10:59,370 --> 00:11:02,280
is that it's so gentle.
It wouldn't even bruise a tomato skin.

245
00:11:02,281 --> 00:11:04,980
Then why are you doing it?
Why now?

246
00:11:05,010 --> 00:11:07,620
The other thing they say it's bullshit 
because they can pay.

247
00:11:07,710 --> 00:11:10,440
They can charge parents.
That's why the other thing they say is,

248
00:11:10,441 --> 00:11:11,670
well,
from doing that,

249
00:11:11,671 --> 00:11:12,504
you,
because,

250
00:11:12,660 --> 00:11:15,900
and this is this,
this infuriates me so much.

251
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:18,810
Um,
they say from manipulating the spine,

252
00:11:18,811 --> 00:11:21,930
because the spine has,
within those bones,

253
00:11:21,931 --> 00:11:25,800
they had the spinal column and the 
nerves control everything in the body.

254
00:11:25,980 --> 00:11:27,400
And so from,
from stimulate,

255
00:11:27,580 --> 00:11:31,620
stimulating the nerves,
you can give the infant all the immunity

256
00:11:31,621 --> 00:11:36,600
it needs to not need their vaccinations.
And that's when I get really.

257
00:11:36,601 --> 00:11:38,840
Oh yeah,
they claimed this shit there.

258
00:11:39,630 --> 00:11:43,650
You got to be real specific claiming 
that by manipulating a baby,

259
00:11:43,651 --> 00:11:45,880
they don't need vaccines.
This is no,

260
00:11:45,900 --> 00:11:46,980
this is,
I understand.

261
00:11:46,981 --> 00:11:47,814
This is not all chiropractors,
but the American chiropractic 

262
00:11:49,861 --> 00:11:50,694
association.
This is fairly well cited within the 

263
00:11:51,871 --> 00:11:54,280
article,
the American Chiropractic Association,

264
00:11:54,281 --> 00:11:55,114
they are generally anti-drug.
They want to use the least amount of 

265
00:11:57,191 --> 00:11:59,650
inter inter medical interventions 
possible.

266
00:11:59,860 --> 00:12:03,100
And chiropractors are not in most states
in this country.

267
00:12:03,490 --> 00:12:08,100
They are not cleared to either prescribe
or give vaccinations.

268
00:12:08,101 --> 00:12:08,934
So if you can manage to get a family to 
come into you for pretty much all of 

269
00:12:12,011 --> 00:12:12,844
their medical needs,
that increases your bottom line and it 

270
00:12:16,001 --> 00:12:16,840
stops,
you know,

271
00:12:16,841 --> 00:12:17,621
and,
and you're going to say,

272
00:12:17,621 --> 00:12:18,850
we can do everything for you.

273
00:12:18,850 --> 00:12:19,683
Of course,
the chiropractors and cleared for 

274
00:12:20,561 --> 00:12:22,410
vaccination.
Of course they don't.

275
00:12:22,470 --> 00:12:25,090
They don't give vaccinations.
And I mean one of.

276
00:12:25,091 --> 00:12:27,910
There's one state in this country,
I believe it was Wisconsin,

277
00:12:27,911 --> 00:12:28,744
where they were trying to get 
chiropractors to be able to give pre 

278
00:12:30,341 --> 00:12:35,341
sports physicals and in in some cases 
the pre sports physical is the only time

279
00:12:35,531 --> 00:12:37,690
all year when a student will see a 
doctor.

280
00:12:37,990 --> 00:12:39,910
So this is,
this is infuriating.

281
00:12:39,911 --> 00:12:40,744
So the like whenever a doctor and I mean
this is like you can look at the acs 

282
00:12:44,321 --> 00:12:45,154
website,
there is a put a couple of links to it 

283
00:12:46,241 --> 00:12:48,270
in the article where they say,
you know,

284
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:50,980
they're,
they're not very provax and I mean their

285
00:12:50,981 --> 00:12:54,880
language on it is under the condition of
freedom of choice,

286
00:12:54,881 --> 00:12:55,714
medical choice.
And it's like they don't say straight 

287
00:12:57,101 --> 00:12:59,410
out vaccines don't work.
They're bad for you,

288
00:12:59,411 --> 00:13:00,244
but they're kind of,
they're wishy washy on it and they're 

289
00:13:02,201 --> 00:13:02,530
not.

290
00:13:02,530 --> 00:13:04,900
They don't say vaccines work and you 
should get them,

291
00:13:05,140 --> 00:13:08,110
but a couple of chiropractors will try 
to say we don't need vaccines.

292
00:13:08,111 --> 00:13:08,944
We can increase your immune system.
We can increase your immunity by 

293
00:13:11,860 --> 00:13:14,350
pressing zero evidence,
zero evidence.

294
00:13:14,351 --> 00:13:15,550
And I'm like,
do me a favor,

295
00:13:15,900 --> 00:13:16,733
tell me which spine,
which part of the spine you press on to 

296
00:13:18,911 --> 00:13:21,100
give child immunity to measles and 
polio.

297
00:13:21,101 --> 00:13:21,870
Give me,
tell me.

298
00:13:21,870 --> 00:13:25,270
Give me the titers.
Test that child's titers to show me that

299
00:13:25,271 --> 00:13:26,104
they're immune to polio.
Now from you touching their goddamn 

300
00:13:27,850 --> 00:13:29,140
spine.
Maybe I.

301
00:13:29,140 --> 00:13:29,891
It's like,
how about this?

302
00:13:29,891 --> 00:13:32,260
How about I'll punch you in the.
I'm not going to punch a chiropractor.

303
00:13:32,380 --> 00:13:33,220
How about I just,
you know,

304
00:13:33,340 --> 00:13:37,240
not just give you a few little,
like a little pokes in the back and then

305
00:13:37,241 --> 00:13:40,600
you're going to be immune to smallpox.
Just just let me know how that works.

306
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:41,433
But I can't.
I can't get behind a system that has no 

307
00:13:44,291 --> 00:13:48,070
evidence and tells me it's going to make
children immune to deadly diseases.

308
00:13:48,260 --> 00:13:50,650
Here's a real question.
How did it get this far?

309
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:54,250
Like how,
how did this guy who's a magnetic healer

310
00:13:54,251 --> 00:13:55,084
who had no background in medicine come 
up with this system and then have it 

311
00:14:00,581 --> 00:14:03,610
spread all over the world?
It's such a good story,

312
00:14:03,611 --> 00:14:08,320
isn't that people love a story that says
that you can heal them without,

313
00:14:08,340 --> 00:14:09,173
uh,
without taking dangerous drugs and at 

314
00:14:10,211 --> 00:14:11,044
the time and forget about medicine 
wasn't even just just helping you with 

315
00:14:15,221 --> 00:14:16,930
anything.
It's really,

316
00:14:16,931 --> 00:14:17,764
it's partially because of when it came 
up because we only found out 50 years 

317
00:14:20,801 --> 00:14:23,390
after this that uh,
that uh,

318
00:14:23,530 --> 00:14:24,363
frontal lobotomies were a bad fucking 
idea and that the little was going to 

319
00:14:27,361 --> 00:14:28,710
kill babies.
Uh,

320
00:14:28,750 --> 00:14:29,583
so we were,
we were really fucking bad at medicine 

321
00:14:32,501 --> 00:14:34,480
when this came up and we're,
I mean,

322
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:35,433
we're way better at it now,
but we still don't have the answers to 

323
00:14:37,781 --> 00:14:38,140
everything.

324
00:14:38,140 --> 00:14:38,973
And that's kind of,
I don't want to say a failure of the 

325
00:14:40,331 --> 00:14:41,164
medical system,
but it's just a sign of where we are 

326
00:14:42,431 --> 00:14:43,264
now.
So think about the number of people who 

327
00:14:44,411 --> 00:14:47,630
have sent us anecdotes saying,
you know,

328
00:14:47,650 --> 00:14:48,483
I was in miserable pain and my 
chiropractor was the only thing that 

329
00:14:50,351 --> 00:14:52,640
worked.
And it's like maybe you needed to get a,

330
00:14:52,700 --> 00:14:53,533
you know,
get to physical therapy for longer term 

331
00:14:55,821 --> 00:14:57,500
pain.
But these people that are still going to

332
00:14:57,501 --> 00:14:58,334
their Kairos,
it means they're still in pain and they 

333
00:15:00,831 --> 00:15:02,960
should go to a physical therapist for,
you know,

334
00:15:02,961 --> 00:15:03,794
a couple months of therapy that will 
eventually strengthened their backs and 

335
00:15:06,441 --> 00:15:09,320
take care of those issues and you know,
get a massage,

336
00:15:09,321 --> 00:15:12,260
but they're going to their Cairo because
medical has not said,

337
00:15:12,290 --> 00:15:13,123
you know,
we don't have a tricorder that can scan 

338
00:15:14,271 --> 00:15:15,104
you,
show the exact thing and say here's the 

339
00:15:16,131 --> 00:15:18,170
exact medicine drug and thing that will 
fix you.

340
00:15:18,470 --> 00:15:20,300
It's kind of,
and I hate to use this term,

341
00:15:20,301 --> 00:15:21,134
but it's out of the failures of the 
medical system that something like this 

342
00:15:23,660 --> 00:15:26,360
has shown up,
so we're not perfect at medicine yet.

343
00:15:26,361 --> 00:15:30,320
And that's why alternative medicine 
swoops in with bullshit.

344
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:31,793
It's just a matter of innovation.
It's like there's a certain level that 

345
00:15:34,350 --> 00:15:35,183
the medical community is at right now.
It's pretty staggering what they're 

346
00:15:37,291 --> 00:15:38,124
capable of,
but it's still growing and learning and 

347
00:15:41,750 --> 00:15:42,583
we're in a constant state of progress.
But what's shocking to me is how far 

348
00:15:46,380 --> 00:15:51,380
this medical healer or magnetic healers 
quack idea.

349
00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:52,473
God.
I just thought it was based on 

350
00:15:53,971 --> 00:15:55,140
something.
I mean,

351
00:15:55,141 --> 00:15:55,974
I really did.
I've been going to a chiropractor for 

352
00:15:57,091 --> 00:15:59,850
years or different chiropractors for 
years.

353
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:02,550
It's in.
One of them was like this guy used to go

354
00:16:02,551 --> 00:16:06,600
to on Hollywood is 40 bucks.
It's literally he would take care of you

355
00:16:06,601 --> 00:16:07,434
for like 10 minutes.
He would rub your back a little bit and 

356
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:12,760
massage a little bit and then he would 
pop it and then go,

357
00:16:12,761 --> 00:16:13,321
oh,
we got it.

358
00:16:13,321 --> 00:16:14,850
We got it.
And I'd be like,

359
00:16:14,851 --> 00:16:16,240
okay.
And I would think her head,

360
00:16:16,241 --> 00:16:17,760
man,
maybe I'll start feeling better now.

361
00:16:17,810 --> 00:16:20,190
I've got a foam roller for 20 bucks that
I can lend.

362
00:16:20,191 --> 00:16:21,900
Jill will crack your back really well.

363
00:16:22,910 --> 00:16:23,661
So.
Well,

364
00:16:23,661 --> 00:16:24,494
yeah.
Um,

365
00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:25,473
it's just,
it's just stunning to me that insurance 

366
00:16:27,561 --> 00:16:29,930
companies pay for it and that it's been 
around so long.

367
00:16:30,380 --> 00:16:32,660
How did that happen?
How are insurance companies?

368
00:16:32,890 --> 00:16:33,723
There was some lobbying,
and I don't think I put this into the 

369
00:16:35,291 --> 00:16:36,124
article,
but there was a lot of lobbying from 

370
00:16:37,391 --> 00:16:38,224
chiropractors in I believe the seventies
that pushed the American Medical 

371
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:43,353
Association and uh,
and the insurance companies as a whole 

372
00:16:44,771 --> 00:16:49,090
to kind of accept them as being 
medically a part of the system.

373
00:16:49,091 --> 00:16:49,924
And that's part of why more and more 
insurance companies now will cover them 

374
00:16:53,891 --> 00:16:57,790
and accept them.
And even though like most doctors won't,

375
00:16:58,060 --> 00:17:01,330
like a lot of doctors won't refer you.
They'll kind of be like,

376
00:17:01,331 --> 00:17:02,980
well,
you can look into Cairo.

377
00:17:02,981 --> 00:17:06,900
Like there's still from a lot of doctors
push back,

378
00:17:07,020 --> 00:17:07,853
uh,
but there's a little bit more coverage 

379
00:17:08,921 --> 00:17:10,960
now just because of a lot of lobbying in
the seventies

380
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:16,160
now have chiropractors do have a center 
or a treatment center or whatever it is.

381
00:17:16,531 --> 00:17:19,410
And they have a bunch of different 
methods that they employ.

382
00:17:19,710 --> 00:17:23,190
This is not saying that those other 
methods might not give you some relief,

383
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:27,300
but the actual cracking of the next and 
the cracking of the back,

384
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:30,750
there's virtually no evidence at that 
heals anything.

385
00:17:30,780 --> 00:17:31,613
Or he stops and he promotes your immune 
system functioning better or anything 

386
00:17:36,871 --> 00:17:39,180
like that on all these things that it's 
based on.

387
00:17:39,670 --> 00:17:42,340
It's precisely like the big thing is 
that,

388
00:17:42,740 --> 00:17:46,780
I mean there,
if they were just claiming we can reduce

389
00:17:46,781 --> 00:17:48,940
your back pain,
if that was the only thing they claimed,

390
00:17:48,941 --> 00:17:50,970
I wouldn't have written the article,
you know,

391
00:17:50,971 --> 00:17:55,971
but what they're claiming is that they 
can fix all of your health by realigning

392
00:17:56,581 --> 00:18:00,810
these vertebral subluxations which have 
never been proven to exist.

393
00:18:00,811 --> 00:18:03,930
So like what are you doing when you're 
back pops?

394
00:18:04,110 --> 00:18:05,580
What is actually happening?
It's like,

395
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:07,920
I wish I had intergen being released or 
something.

396
00:18:07,921 --> 00:18:08,754
I think it's just moving around air 
bubbles like enemy in tiny little bits 

397
00:18:11,101 --> 00:18:12,450
of bubbles and yeah,
they are like,

398
00:18:12,510 --> 00:18:13,343
they're,
I don't think realigning is the right 

399
00:18:14,851 --> 00:18:15,511
word,
but you know,

400
00:18:15,511 --> 00:18:16,840
they're,
they're doing their,

401
00:18:16,890 --> 00:18:17,723
they're moving around your back in a way
that it kind of national news because 

402
00:18:20,191 --> 00:18:22,680
you can kind of move and twist in your 
back will pop.

403
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:23,513
But like,
they're doing some manipulation of 

404
00:18:24,871 --> 00:18:26,970
things that kind of naturally happened 
to,

405
00:18:26,971 --> 00:18:28,200
uh,
to a spine,

406
00:18:28,490 --> 00:18:29,011
uh,
with,

407
00:18:29,011 --> 00:18:29,844
you know,
with a tiny little bit tiny bit of 

408
00:18:31,351 --> 00:18:34,080
degeneration with age,
I think I'm not exactly the right expert

409
00:18:34,081 --> 00:18:38,370
to explain this type of thing.
An osteopath would be a better person to

410
00:18:38,371 --> 00:18:41,970
explain this because there's a,
there are people who are a little better

411
00:18:41,971 --> 00:18:44,790
at spinal manipulation than a 
chiropractor,

412
00:18:44,791 --> 00:18:45,624
which is a dio and osteopaths.
So in this country we have mds and dos 

413
00:18:49,621 --> 00:18:53,340
and they both can practice medicine,
doctor of osteopathy,

414
00:18:53,380 --> 00:18:56,340
a doctor of osteopathy.
I believe that's the correct term.

415
00:18:56,341 --> 00:18:57,570
And my doctor is actually,
uh,

416
00:18:57,630 --> 00:18:58,110
my,
uh,

417
00:18:58,110 --> 00:19:01,800
primary care is an osteopath and he's 
given me a spinal manipulation once,

418
00:19:01,801 --> 00:19:04,590
when my back was killing me and we had 
no idea what it was.

419
00:19:04,591 --> 00:19:09,090
And it turned out I had a broken rib,
which was not a good time to do a spinal

420
00:19:09,091 --> 00:19:09,850
manipulation.

421
00:19:09,850 --> 00:19:12,120
We've got a rib broken right on your 
spine,

422
00:19:12,510 --> 00:19:14,460
but it was like he,
um,

423
00:19:14,970 --> 00:19:17,930
the difference is an osteopath never 
claimed that they're,

424
00:19:17,940 --> 00:19:20,680
um,
they're cracking your back to try it.

425
00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:21,720
Yeah,
exactly.

426
00:19:21,721 --> 00:19:23,130
They're,
they're giving you,

427
00:19:23,370 --> 00:19:25,680
they're giving you your vaccines,
they're doing,

428
00:19:25,681 --> 00:19:26,461
you know,
they're going,

429
00:19:26,461 --> 00:19:27,960
wow,
there's something wrong with your,

430
00:19:28,170 --> 00:19:28,920
with your,
uh,

431
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:30,870
a we're going to send you to a 
gynecologist.

432
00:19:30,871 --> 00:19:31,704
Like they're,
they're doing all the things that 

433
00:19:32,641 --> 00:19:36,240
doctors should do for your health and if
your back is in pain,

434
00:19:36,241 --> 00:19:37,074
they'll say,
do you want to try and make a 

435
00:19:37,651 --> 00:19:39,510
manipulation?
They're not pushing that,

436
00:19:39,730 --> 00:19:42,580
that's a part of their care.
And they try to do science based,

437
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:43,830
uh,
you know,

438
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:47,840
manipulations for the potential help of,
uh,

439
00:19:48,170 --> 00:19:51,260
of a back relief,
but they don't know.

440
00:19:51,320 --> 00:19:53,610
They don't want to do that longterm.
They do it minimally.

441
00:19:53,611 --> 00:19:55,440
At least that's been my experience with 
it.

442
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:57,320
And it seems to be like,
it.

443
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:58,273
There still seems to be,
I'd say at best weak evidence that it 

444
00:20:01,081 --> 00:20:02,550
helps with,
uh,

445
00:20:02,551 --> 00:20:03,740
with back pain.
Well,

446
00:20:03,750 --> 00:20:07,380
the problem is they usually do it with 
other things that also has been shown to

447
00:20:07,381 --> 00:20:09,390
help with back pain.
So like,

448
00:20:09,610 --> 00:20:11,160
like I said,
and also just breast.

449
00:20:11,790 --> 00:20:13,260
Yes.
Breast ice,

450
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:16,550
antiinflammatories seeing all these 
different factors.

451
00:20:16,551 --> 00:20:18,710
And while I went to a chiropractor and 
he helped me.

452
00:20:20,090 --> 00:20:20,880
Yeah.
And I make,

453
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:21,713
I think that,
I think it's funny the things that 

454
00:20:23,301 --> 00:20:24,134
chiropractors add into it because like 
one of the things that I went into in 

455
00:20:26,461 --> 00:20:26,900
this,
uh,

456
00:20:26,900 --> 00:20:28,360
in this article because we,
we,

457
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:31,440
we really like diving deep on some of 
the things that we investigate.

458
00:20:31,670 --> 00:20:33,090
Um,
and it's like I try,

459
00:20:33,110 --> 00:20:33,943
I,
like,

460
00:20:34,050 --> 00:20:36,060
I'll admit I'm biased when I go in,
I,

461
00:20:36,100 --> 00:20:39,010
because I,
I go after a lot of kind of,

462
00:20:39,090 --> 00:20:40,710
some of the naturally things and I'm 
not,

463
00:20:40,980 --> 00:20:42,030
I'm not anti natural.

464
00:20:42,030 --> 00:20:42,863
Like I,
I'm not 100 percent against going into 

465
00:20:45,050 --> 00:20:47,400
homeopathics.
It's funny because we can,

466
00:20:47,460 --> 00:20:49,030
we can go into some of it's real,
right?

467
00:20:49,031 --> 00:20:49,864
Like garlic really is good for 
infections or some stuff that's 

468
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:53,950
legitimate.
Good for your heart.

469
00:20:53,951 --> 00:20:55,660
Ginger,
I love when I have a stomach ache,

470
00:20:55,661 --> 00:20:58,650
I'll go for ginger before I go first.
Remedies that work.

471
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:00,670
There are some herbal remedies and I'm 
like,

472
00:21:00,671 --> 00:21:01,900
absolutely.
Keep them in your,

473
00:21:01,901 --> 00:21:04,450
in your cabinet.
I'm not against them,

474
00:21:04,451 --> 00:21:07,660
but I'm against people taking things 
without evidence.

475
00:21:07,661 --> 00:21:09,030
And I think that's the thing.
Like try,

476
00:21:09,060 --> 00:21:11,620
try absolutely it to look for the hard 
evidence,

477
00:21:11,820 --> 00:21:13,390
uh,
before you waste your money.

478
00:21:13,391 --> 00:21:16,180
And I think that's the thing that people
have fallen into because they'll say,

479
00:21:16,210 --> 00:21:16,991
oh,
it's natural,

480
00:21:16,991 --> 00:21:17,824
it's better.
It's like,

481
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:21,490
because polio is natural,
I don't think it's very good for you,

482
00:21:21,491 --> 00:21:22,141
like,
but I,

483
00:21:22,141 --> 00:21:23,470
I know,
I know that's a straw man,

484
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:24,520
fully aware of it.

485
00:21:24,790 --> 00:21:25,623
But I also think that people should,
should ask for evidence and you never 

486
00:21:28,451 --> 00:21:29,284
know,
asked for it to manned it before you 

487
00:21:29,951 --> 00:21:33,790
give somebody your money and that's what
people haven't done with chiropractors.

488
00:21:33,791 --> 00:21:35,950
And that is the very good point.
And it's,

489
00:21:35,951 --> 00:21:36,784
you know,
I think people deserve evidence and 

490
00:21:38,441 --> 00:21:40,480
that's.
And I think that's something that hasn't

491
00:21:40,481 --> 00:21:41,314
been out in the public sphere.
Like there was an article I was trying 

492
00:21:43,271 --> 00:21:44,760
to write a while ago,
um,

493
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:46,930
I forget the exact topic,
but one of my editors,

494
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:47,780
uh,
you know,

495
00:21:47,780 --> 00:21:49,210
sending it back to me credit,
she's like,

496
00:21:49,211 --> 00:21:50,330
I've read that she,
uh,

497
00:21:50,470 --> 00:21:51,730
her comment back was,
well,

498
00:21:51,731 --> 00:21:54,360
I've been reading this a lot online.
A lot of people have been saying this.

499
00:21:54,370 --> 00:21:55,203
I'm like,
a lot of people have been saying is not 

500
00:21:56,681 --> 00:21:59,290
evidence.
That's the exact opposite of it.

501
00:21:59,291 --> 00:22:00,011
Like I'm like,
here,

502
00:22:00,011 --> 00:22:04,720
I put in the peer review data on this 
yet or I didn't work with her again.

503
00:22:05,210 --> 00:22:07,030
She was.
A lot of people have been saying,

504
00:22:07,040 --> 00:22:08,740
you can't do that.
That's not.

505
00:22:08,890 --> 00:22:10,990
That's the end.
I mean this is why I liked the editor,

506
00:22:10,991 --> 00:22:14,440
so I'm working with now quite a bit.
The problem with this whole clinic thing

507
00:22:14,441 --> 00:22:19,441
though is that they don't have to have 
any sort of background in kinesiology or

508
00:22:20,381 --> 00:22:24,430
in physical therapy or any of these 
things and so they incorporate all these

509
00:22:24,431 --> 00:22:26,710
other modalities,
all these other methods of healing you,

510
00:22:26,711 --> 00:22:30,340
but they don't have to have a background
in education in those things and they're

511
00:22:30,341 --> 00:22:31,760
calling themselves a doctor.
No,

512
00:22:31,790 --> 00:22:33,430
there is.
There is one thing I've heard of,

513
00:22:33,431 --> 00:22:34,264
and this isn't.
This is why I'd say don't go to a 

514
00:22:35,891 --> 00:22:39,400
chiropractor because we don't know.
You don't know what you're going to walk

515
00:22:39,401 --> 00:22:40,234
into,
but I have heard a couple of cases of 

516
00:22:42,461 --> 00:22:43,294
times this being the case where a 
chiropractor at first they go to school 

517
00:22:46,061 --> 00:22:49,420
for physical therapy and then they find 
they can't open their own clinic.

518
00:22:49,420 --> 00:22:52,720
Even if they've got like an MBA and a 
physical therapy background.

519
00:22:52,721 --> 00:22:54,340
They're like,
how do I open my own clinic?

520
00:22:54,460 --> 00:22:57,280
And they realize if they just go to 
school for Chiropractic,

521
00:22:57,400 --> 00:22:58,233
they can do the physical therapy work 
they want to and offer a spinal 

522
00:23:01,331 --> 00:23:02,164
manipulation on the side.
Now how long does it take to get a 

523
00:23:03,731 --> 00:23:06,510
degree in Chiropractic?
Forty three,

524
00:23:06,940 --> 00:23:07,870
three,
four years.

525
00:23:07,871 --> 00:23:09,250
Like it's.
I mean it's a lot of school,

526
00:23:09,251 --> 00:23:11,560
but think about a learn.
I had a,

527
00:23:11,620 --> 00:23:14,230
had a crack spines.
I mean the thing that I think created by

528
00:23:14,231 --> 00:23:15,064
a guy who's a quack,
what the fuck could they possibly be 

529
00:23:16,931 --> 00:23:19,380
teaching you for four years?
I do.

530
00:23:19,420 --> 00:23:20,253
They do learn some anatomy,
but it's like they also learned some 

531
00:23:23,020 --> 00:23:24,520
bullshit along with it.
So I'm like,

532
00:23:24,521 --> 00:23:26,320
I wonder.
And I mean this isn't.

533
00:23:26,620 --> 00:23:29,110
I get it.
This isn't all chiropractor's obviously,

534
00:23:29,111 --> 00:23:29,944
but like I know it's hard to figure out 
which one you're going to walk into 

535
00:23:33,341 --> 00:23:36,430
that's going to be a bullshit artist and
not so like I,

536
00:23:36,650 --> 00:23:37,483
I did want it like this isn't,
this wasn't the point I was going to 

537
00:23:39,041 --> 00:23:41,590
bring up in an article that was going to
have a specific point of view,

538
00:23:41,591 --> 00:23:44,320
but like I know there are some out there
that say I,

539
00:23:44,321 --> 00:23:46,880
you know,
I to give people physical therapy,

540
00:23:46,881 --> 00:23:47,714
I want to strengthen up their spine,
I want to get them out of here in less 

541
00:23:50,901 --> 00:23:53,120
pain so that if they injure themselves 
again,

542
00:23:53,300 --> 00:23:54,133
they know they can come back to me and 
trust me with their spine and also give 

543
00:23:56,961 --> 00:23:59,480
them some relief while we're fixing 
them.

544
00:23:59,660 --> 00:24:00,021
So,
you know,

545
00:24:00,021 --> 00:24:02,270
this is a thing that happens,
but I don't think it's all the time.

546
00:24:02,280 --> 00:24:04,220
It's,
I mean he's clearly not all the time.

547
00:24:04,221 --> 00:24:05,054
So you know,
you're going to have some really moral 

548
00:24:06,561 --> 00:24:09,650
people in every field and you're gonna 
have some really fucked up once in every

549
00:24:09,651 --> 00:24:10,970
field.
Like we were.

550
00:24:11,180 --> 00:24:12,013
One of the things we touched on in the 
article were these very social media 

551
00:24:15,381 --> 00:24:16,214
savvy people,
and this is something that drives me 

552
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:18,433
fucking crazy.
You have to hunt and peck through their 

553
00:24:20,391 --> 00:24:22,760
websites to find that they say that 
they're a chiropractor.

554
00:24:22,761 --> 00:24:25,580
They just say doctor everywhere Dr,
and they're giving.

555
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:26,593
They're giving recipe ideas and they're 
giving and they're talking about the 

556
00:24:29,031 --> 00:24:29,864
adrenal glands and the adrenal glands.
They're not anywhere near close to the 

557
00:24:32,841 --> 00:24:35,330
spine and this is the thing that they're
talking about.

558
00:24:35,331 --> 00:24:36,580
I'm like,
the adrenal glands are,

559
00:24:36,680 --> 00:24:37,513
they're part of talking about 
manipulating the spine to help the 

560
00:24:39,501 --> 00:24:40,130
adrenal glands.

561
00:24:40,130 --> 00:24:40,963
They're talking about.
One of the things they talk about a lot 

562
00:24:42,501 --> 00:24:43,334
is adrenal fatigue syndrome,
which has never been proven to be a 

563
00:24:46,311 --> 00:24:48,950
thing.
It's not recognized as a,

564
00:24:48,951 --> 00:24:52,070
as a disorder anywhere within the 
medical care system.

565
00:24:52,071 --> 00:24:55,880
Now you can have a couple of different 
disorders of the adrenal gland.

566
00:24:55,881 --> 00:24:58,070
You have cushing's syndrome.
Um,

567
00:24:58,510 --> 00:24:59,343
have like,
there are a couple of different things 

568
00:24:59,931 --> 00:25:00,764
that can go wrong with.
Your adrenal glands are a little glands 

569
00:25:02,541 --> 00:25:04,160
that sit on top of the kidneys.
Uh,

570
00:25:04,310 --> 00:25:08,170
but this is the specialty I believe.
Hold on a second,

571
00:25:08,180 --> 00:25:09,950
having a blonde moment on the words,
uh,

572
00:25:09,980 --> 00:25:12,260
but like there's the,
a sub specialty,

573
00:25:12,261 --> 00:25:16,220
but the specialty for which you're going
to study the adrenal glands isn't even a

574
00:25:16,221 --> 00:25:17,054
specialty that chiropractic has.
So it's like if you want to know about 

575
00:25:20,481 --> 00:25:21,880
your,
if you're having issues with that,

576
00:25:21,881 --> 00:25:22,714
like it's like the,
the things that chiropractor seem to 

577
00:25:25,401 --> 00:25:27,050
harp on right now,
or a lot with,

578
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:29,360
uh,
immunology or a lot with,

579
00:25:29,390 --> 00:25:30,290
uh,
sorry,

580
00:25:30,291 --> 00:25:32,150
just having a complete blonde moment on 
this.

581
00:25:32,390 --> 00:25:33,210
Uh,
but there,

582
00:25:33,210 --> 00:25:34,043
there are specialties at chiropractor 
seem to harp on a lot lately and it 

583
00:25:36,981 --> 00:25:40,220
seems to be the types of things that are
very nebulous and very hard to,

584
00:25:40,550 --> 00:25:41,383
uh,
to nail down when someone's having an 

585
00:25:42,351 --> 00:25:43,910
issue with it.
And these are,

586
00:25:43,970 --> 00:25:46,910
these are things that chiropractors just
don't have the training in.

587
00:25:47,070 --> 00:25:47,903
So essentially someone's putting up a 
health website and they're claiming to 

588
00:25:51,141 --> 00:25:51,974
be a doctor and they're offering all of 
this advice on diet and all these 

589
00:25:54,701 --> 00:25:57,950
different things.
But when you get to what is their degree

590
00:25:57,951 --> 00:25:58,910
in,
they don't.

591
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:02,060
It's not a real doctor.
It's a chiropractor and it's,

592
00:26:02,190 --> 00:26:03,023
and they're basically all,
they're the type of advice they're 

593
00:26:04,341 --> 00:26:06,800
giving is take all these herbs,
eat a,

594
00:26:06,801 --> 00:26:08,630
you know,
eating an alkaline diet,

595
00:26:08,810 --> 00:26:10,700
which is again,
bullshit.

596
00:26:10,930 --> 00:26:11,500
Um,
it's,

597
00:26:11,500 --> 00:26:12,333
there's one of my favorite things with 
the alkaline diet is they're always 

598
00:26:15,351 --> 00:26:16,430
like,
drink lemon water.

599
00:26:16,430 --> 00:26:17,750
I'm like,
that's acidic,

600
00:26:18,410 --> 00:26:20,390
which I might know from my chemistry 
degree,

601
00:26:20,660 --> 00:26:21,493
you know,
what is the premise of this alkaline 

602
00:26:22,731 --> 00:26:23,564
diet?
Because I remember people were pushing 

603
00:26:24,540 --> 00:26:25,373
that awhile back saying that you could 
cure cancer and shit just by having a 

604
00:26:29,541 --> 00:26:33,040
diet that's alkaline sort of acidic it,
which is,

605
00:26:33,140 --> 00:26:34,730
I mean like,
and that's the premise of it.

606
00:26:34,731 --> 00:26:35,720
And,
but it's like they,

607
00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:36,830
here's the thing,
we are,

608
00:26:36,831 --> 00:26:39,590
your body's Ph is really tightly 
controlled.

609
00:26:39,591 --> 00:26:41,990
Like your blood is between,
I think seven point three,

610
00:26:41,991 --> 00:26:43,530
five and seven point five,
five.

611
00:26:43,710 --> 00:26:44,543
A different organ systems have a fairly 
tightly controlled ph of your urine can 

612
00:26:49,201 --> 00:26:51,330
vary a little bit depending on what 
you've consumed.

613
00:26:51,570 --> 00:26:52,770
But there's,
you know,

614
00:26:52,771 --> 00:26:55,170
there's a tightly controlled Ph within 
your body.

615
00:26:55,320 --> 00:26:57,660
If you're suddenly go,
you know,

616
00:26:57,690 --> 00:27:00,450
if suddenly you have a Ph of 10,
which is,

617
00:27:00,451 --> 00:27:01,560
you know,
fairly alkaline,

618
00:27:01,770 --> 00:27:03,000
your,
they're,

619
00:27:03,060 --> 00:27:05,760
your friends are your friends are going 
to miss you at your funeral,

620
00:27:05,761 --> 00:27:06,560
hopefully.

621
00:27:06,560 --> 00:27:07,590
Um,
so that's,

622
00:27:07,650 --> 00:27:10,560
that's what I got on that.
But like she didn't have a high ph.

623
00:27:10,590 --> 00:27:13,590
you're dead if you're suddenly because 
you know that's a,

624
00:27:13,620 --> 00:27:16,080
that's an alkaline ph.
if you're suddenly really,

625
00:27:16,081 --> 00:27:18,990
really alkaline,
we're gonna miss you.

626
00:27:19,430 --> 00:27:24,320
That's someone to be that alcohol,
drinking a bunch of lie.

627
00:27:24,430 --> 00:27:26,050
I don't know,
like,

628
00:27:26,270 --> 00:27:28,290
don't do you.
I mean you're like,

629
00:27:28,291 --> 00:27:29,124
there's something really wrong with your
ability to filter things out of your 

630
00:27:31,891 --> 00:27:34,320
body if you're suddenly like,
that's just,

631
00:27:34,321 --> 00:27:36,810
it's just not a thing that happens to a 
healthy human.

632
00:27:36,811 --> 00:27:38,730
If you're all of a sudden really 
alkaline,

633
00:27:38,731 --> 00:27:39,564
but this diet won't do it.
Especially when the things that they're 

634
00:27:42,090 --> 00:27:44,930
recommending are like lemons,
like,

635
00:27:44,940 --> 00:27:46,560
and one of the things they say is,
oh,

636
00:27:46,561 --> 00:27:50,100
well your body takes that acidic fruit 
and turned it alkaline.

637
00:27:50,101 --> 00:27:51,830
I'm like,
go to the,

638
00:27:52,740 --> 00:27:54,430
where are they coming up with this 
stuff?

639
00:27:54,690 --> 00:27:58,810
This is just nonsense that someone's 
just repeating online and there.

640
00:27:59,050 --> 00:28:01,120
Oh,
and the things I say like the,

641
00:28:01,130 --> 00:28:04,010
the Diet they've designed is a fairly 
low calorie diet.

642
00:28:04,011 --> 00:28:04,844
Like it'll make you lose weight,
but it's not going to make you go 

643
00:28:06,171 --> 00:28:08,630
alkaline and it's not going to fucking 
fight cancer.

644
00:28:08,930 --> 00:28:09,763
Like it's,

645
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,660
if anything,
the reduction in calories or probably be

646
00:28:12,661 --> 00:28:16,320
good because you lose some body fat.
We have less inflammation

647
00:28:16,740 --> 00:28:17,421
like,
yeah,

648
00:28:17,421 --> 00:28:18,500
it's,
there are,

649
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:19,880
there have been shown to be,
you know,

650
00:28:19,881 --> 00:28:21,260
links between lower,
uh,

651
00:28:21,290 --> 00:28:24,950
lower body fat and lower incidences of 
cancer,

652
00:28:24,951 --> 00:28:25,431
which is,
you know,

653
00:28:25,431 --> 00:28:27,740
that's a good thing.
Losing weight if you're,

654
00:28:27,741 --> 00:28:28,574
if you're overweight and you're having 
medical problems from it overall good 

655
00:28:30,921 --> 00:28:32,540
thing.
But there is no,

656
00:28:32,541 --> 00:28:34,940
uh,
shown a link between,

657
00:28:35,250 --> 00:28:36,083
uh,
between this specific diet and a lower 

658
00:28:38,331 --> 00:28:40,940
incidence of cancer or any other 
disorders.

659
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:43,030
But it's just like

660
00:28:43,350 --> 00:28:44,810
so fat.
It's just one of those things.

661
00:28:45,100 --> 00:28:46,490
I remember when people were wearing 
those,

662
00:28:46,491 --> 00:28:47,324
uh,
holograms attached to a rubber band 

663
00:28:48,921 --> 00:28:51,800
around their wrist.
And do you remember these stupid fucking

664
00:28:51,801 --> 00:28:53,090
things?
Do you remember him?

665
00:28:53,091 --> 00:28:54,120
Jamie?
You remember him,

666
00:28:54,140 --> 00:28:54,973
right?
Gwyneth paltrow has gotten trouble for 

667
00:28:56,901 --> 00:29:01,230
selling them on her like fucking bitch.
No offense squared,

668
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:02,793
but I might've.
I might've said some mean things about 

669
00:29:04,761 --> 00:29:05,594
Glenn.
Have been a couple of things about her 

670
00:29:07,161 --> 00:29:10,130
lately.
Inner fucking nutty website she takes.

671
00:29:10,370 --> 00:29:11,203
You're supposed to wear like a rock 
inside your vagina is not one of those 

672
00:29:13,701 --> 00:29:15,360
things.
I call them pussy rocks.

673
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:16,233
That's rocks are hilarious.
I guess it would be like strengthen you 

674
00:29:20,580 --> 00:29:23,270
if you want to strengthen it.
Just two key goals around a dick.

675
00:29:23,300 --> 00:29:25,130
That's my.
That's my method.

676
00:29:25,890 --> 00:29:29,300
Works for Cambrian rocks.
A good way to go.

677
00:29:29,450 --> 00:29:31,940
Gwyneth paltrow wants to heal you with 
magic stickers.

678
00:29:31,940 --> 00:29:35,150
Jesus Christ bitches.
She needs getting paid.

679
00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:35,993
They'll tell you that.
There's a lot of dummies out there that 

680
00:29:37,390 --> 00:29:38,223
are sought all the way is atm machine.
She is proof that sells way better than 

681
00:29:42,371 --> 00:29:43,390
science.
I'm.

682
00:29:43,420 --> 00:29:45,480
I do not have her.
Her salary.

683
00:29:45,481 --> 00:29:47,920
Well wait a minute.
Could rebalance the energy frequency.

684
00:29:47,980 --> 00:29:49,750
I didn't know that.
Hold on a second.

685
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:53,070
She's discovered something about 
stickers different.

686
00:29:53,130 --> 00:29:56,110
Take these stickers.
If they're made with the right material,

687
00:29:56,111 --> 00:29:58,390
you just stick them on your body in the 
right places.

688
00:29:58,391 --> 00:29:59,650
And they,
in quotes,

689
00:29:59,651 --> 00:30:00,484
rebalanced,
the energy frequency in our bodies are 

690
00:30:03,250 --> 00:30:08,250
made out of a NASA space suit material.
And NASA said it was a load of bs.

691
00:30:09,670 --> 00:30:12,680
But hold on a second.
I don't think that NASA is right.

692
00:30:14,050 --> 00:30:18,440
Bunch of movies,
iron man science.

693
00:30:18,540 --> 00:30:19,373
It says Gwyneth paltrow's goop website,
a lifestyle business lifestyle which 

694
00:30:23,411 --> 00:30:25,090
sells all things.
Gwyneth advertise.

695
00:30:25,090 --> 00:30:28,630
These stickers are using NASA space suit
material,

696
00:30:28,631 --> 00:30:31,780
which presumably was the source of their
magic healing properties.

697
00:30:32,350 --> 00:30:37,000
Jesus fucking Christ,
she's special stickers have not made.

698
00:30:37,110 --> 00:30:40,900
This is what NASA says.
They're not made of space suit material,

699
00:30:41,050 --> 00:30:41,883
not that space.
New suit material that has healing 

700
00:30:43,001 --> 00:30:44,440
properties in the first place.
It doesn't,

701
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:46,690
but the quote from the foreign NASA 
scientist,

702
00:30:46,691 --> 00:30:48,870
Mark Shoal,
Shell Shell,

703
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:51,790
Shell Hummer,
Shelmar Shalimar sums it up.

704
00:30:52,330 --> 00:30:53,200
He goes,
wow,

705
00:30:53,350 --> 00:30:55,830
what a load of bs this is or that.
Yeah,

706
00:30:55,890 --> 00:30:58,170
okay.
She's obviously goop.

707
00:30:58,180 --> 00:31:01,390
Quickly updated its site.
Now it doesn't claim anything about NASA

708
00:31:01,391 --> 00:31:02,224
space suits and stickers,
but it didn't dial back in in the 

709
00:31:04,331 --> 00:31:07,600
magical healing claims.
Here's what groups has now in an article

710
00:31:07,601 --> 00:31:11,380
called wearable stickers that promote 
healing in parentheses.

711
00:31:11,500 --> 00:31:12,333
Really?
You fuck human bodies operate at an 

712
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:21,190
ideal energetic frequency,
but everyday stresses and anxiety.

713
00:31:21,430 --> 00:31:22,680
You give me stress,
you bitch.

714
00:31:22,940 --> 00:31:23,773
You can throw off our internal balance,
depleting our energy reserves and 

715
00:31:27,341 --> 00:31:28,174
weakening our immune system.
I'm fucking imagine thinking that you 

716
00:31:30,221 --> 00:31:32,170
could put a sticker on you and it's 
going to heal you.

717
00:31:32,350 --> 00:31:33,910
Body vibe stickers.
Oh my God.

718
00:31:33,911 --> 00:31:35,930
They're called body vibes coming.
Pre-Pro.

719
00:31:36,010 --> 00:31:37,720
They come preprogrammed.
Oh,

720
00:31:37,721 --> 00:31:38,860
fuck.
The programming.

721
00:31:39,250 --> 00:31:41,920
I didn't know that.
To an ideal frequency,

722
00:31:41,921 --> 00:31:45,910
allowing them to target imbalances.
You motherfucker,

723
00:31:46,390 --> 00:31:48,940
you fucking crook.
Don't you have enough money,

724
00:31:48,941 --> 00:31:50,800
bitch.
Jesus Christ.

725
00:31:51,020 --> 00:31:54,550
The residuals on the iron man movies 
just weren't enough for her.

726
00:31:55,480 --> 00:31:58,060
God Damn.
60 bucks for a 10 pack.

727
00:31:58,090 --> 00:32:01,210
Hold Shit.
10 stickers for 60 bucks.

728
00:32:01,690 --> 00:32:05,200
Oh my God.
I'm in the wrong industry.

729
00:32:05,230 --> 00:32:06,063
Apparently.
I need to start selling some fancy 

730
00:32:07,211 --> 00:32:08,740
motherfucking stickers.
No,

731
00:32:08,741 --> 00:32:09,574
you don't.
No,

732
00:32:09,620 --> 00:32:10,840
no,
but look,

733
00:32:10,870 --> 00:32:14,590
this is a very.
This is a very controversial subject,

734
00:32:14,620 --> 00:32:15,453
right?
Like anything that's not regulated by 

735
00:32:17,351 --> 00:32:18,850
the FDA,
like I,

736
00:32:18,930 --> 00:32:21,370
I'm a part of a in interest of full 
disclosure,

737
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:23,170
part of the company on it,
which is a,

738
00:32:23,350 --> 00:32:26,110
we sell supplements,
but the supplements that we sell,

739
00:32:26,111 --> 00:32:29,680
we,
we control everything that we sell,

740
00:32:29,681 --> 00:32:31,960
so we make sure that we do testing on 
it.

741
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:33,730
The supplements that we sell,
like this shit.

742
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:34,593
A Alpha brain did do d,
Two double blind placebo controlled 

743
00:32:37,001 --> 00:32:37,834
studies at Boston Center for memory that
showed increase in verbal memory 

744
00:32:41,721 --> 00:32:43,150
increase in.
Um,

745
00:32:43,260 --> 00:32:47,060
there's a bunch of different things.
What was the other one?

746
00:32:47,061 --> 00:32:49,640
Um,
there was a reaction time,

747
00:32:49,730 --> 00:32:50,563
but there's a whole,
there's actual scientific studies on 

748
00:32:52,731 --> 00:32:54,560
nootropics.
They've been around for a long time.

749
00:32:54,570 --> 00:32:56,330
The nutrients about them just because 
like I've,

750
00:32:56,510 --> 00:32:59,150
I haven't looked into them enough and 
I'm,

751
00:32:59,180 --> 00:33:01,580
I know they're kind of their new ish,
you know,

752
00:33:01,581 --> 00:33:04,310
into the supplement market.
So like I kind of want to look into them

753
00:33:04,311 --> 00:33:05,144
and I don't know enough to comment.
Essentially the building blocks for 

754
00:33:07,401 --> 00:33:09,650
human neurotransmitters,
which your body uses,

755
00:33:09,651 --> 00:33:12,060
the nutrients your body uses to make 
human neurotransmitters.

756
00:33:12,090 --> 00:33:14,090
There's nothing woo woo about it.
Nothing crazy.

757
00:33:14,091 --> 00:33:17,420
It's all backed by science,
but when we started putting them out,

758
00:33:17,421 --> 00:33:19,490
there was a lot of people that were 
claiming bullshit.

759
00:33:19,490 --> 00:33:23,450
You're selling snake oil,
so we had a control these studies and we

760
00:33:23,451 --> 00:33:27,650
had to pay for them at the Boston Center
for memory and put.

761
00:33:27,860 --> 00:33:32,750
We also had to make sure that we put a 
full 100 percent money back guarantee on

762
00:33:32,751 --> 00:33:35,720
any of the supplements where you don't 
have to return them.

763
00:33:35,721 --> 00:33:36,554
Just say they didn't work for you.
Will you will try and make it as clean 

764
00:33:38,901 --> 00:33:40,580
as possible.
This is stuff that I use,

765
00:33:40,790 --> 00:33:44,870
I find benefit in it.
Let's see what people think about it and

766
00:33:44,871 --> 00:33:49,490
let's make sure that we have studies,
but when you sell things like stickers,

767
00:33:49,880 --> 00:33:51,920
like there's no fucking studies on 
stickers.

768
00:33:52,730 --> 00:33:56,060
Said like when she was on a camel a few 
weeks ago and he was like,

769
00:33:56,061 --> 00:33:57,830
so how does it work?
Eventually just came out and said,

770
00:33:57,831 --> 00:33:59,960
I don't know how any of this shit works.
It's like,

771
00:33:59,990 --> 00:34:00,823
yeah,
because you're selling rocks for your 

772
00:34:02,130 --> 00:34:02,630
pulse.

773
00:34:02,630 --> 00:34:03,463
Does she have somebody else?
It doesn't make me and they're just 

774
00:34:04,701 --> 00:34:05,534
unscrupulous and she's a part of it.
She's a CEO and she's apparently in all 

775
00:34:09,081 --> 00:34:12,920
the meetings when she just busy reading.
It's reading scripts and shit.

776
00:34:12,950 --> 00:34:14,810
Look at this one.
Look at this.

777
00:34:14,870 --> 00:34:17,960
Oh,
antianxiety unicorn skin at the beach.

778
00:34:18,170 --> 00:34:19,100
Beauty,
sleep.

779
00:34:19,220 --> 00:34:21,590
Wait a minute.
One of each vibe.

780
00:34:21,591 --> 00:34:23,750
One of the vibes of the beach.
Chill.

781
00:34:24,250 --> 00:34:26,970
That's what the preprogrammed chilled 
for.

782
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:29,850
For self love.
One of them is chilled for UNICORNS.

783
00:34:29,851 --> 00:34:31,480
Skin.
That's a real love.

784
00:34:31,500 --> 00:34:34,760
I demand an orgasm within three minutes.
I don't think it works that way.

785
00:34:34,990 --> 00:34:35,760
Right?
All.

786
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:36,593
Yeah.
I don't just feeling good about 

787
00:34:37,551 --> 00:34:39,810
yourself.
It doesn't Gaillard rock rocked out,

788
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:43,510
but these things are like,
you know,

789
00:34:43,970 --> 00:34:44,803
it's really weird.
It's like I'm not a big fan of the 

790
00:34:47,151 --> 00:34:47,984
government stepping in and you know,
regulating everything because I know 

791
00:34:51,771 --> 00:34:55,430
there's a lot of supplements that 
actually do work and for them to be,

792
00:34:55,490 --> 00:34:56,323
to get passed by the FDA,
you have to go through these exhaustive 

793
00:34:59,631 --> 00:35:00,464
tests.
They cost hundreds of thousands of 

794
00:35:01,881 --> 00:35:03,290
dollars.
It's a huge thing.

795
00:35:03,291 --> 00:35:05,450
It takes a long time and I mean,
here's the.

796
00:35:05,451 --> 00:35:07,550
I think that like the reason why I'm a 
fan,

797
00:35:07,590 --> 00:35:08,423
I have at least some amount of 
government regulation on supplements is 

798
00:35:11,401 --> 00:35:12,234
to stop,
unscrew a very unscrupulous claims 

799
00:35:14,101 --> 00:35:17,520
because especially with some of the 
supplement industry,

800
00:35:17,690 --> 00:35:19,590
they,
there are claims that these are,

801
00:35:19,591 --> 00:35:20,424
um,
that there are certain things on or 

802
00:35:22,770 --> 00:35:25,590
sorry in a package and after,
you know,

803
00:35:25,591 --> 00:35:28,860
some independent testing,
you'll find that some of the,

804
00:35:28,940 --> 00:35:31,890
uh,
some packages don't have what they claim

805
00:35:31,891 --> 00:35:32,870
in their,
like some,

806
00:35:33,150 --> 00:35:33,983
it was something like a third of a 
supplement packages didn't have any of 

807
00:35:37,321 --> 00:35:39,180
the ingredients in there or they had 
less of it.

808
00:35:39,181 --> 00:35:41,820
And I'm like that's not,
that's not good for the consumer.

809
00:35:41,821 --> 00:35:44,520
So I wish there was a way to regulate it
a little bit better.

810
00:35:44,521 --> 00:35:45,050
At least

811
00:35:45,050 --> 00:35:46,520
I just don't think it should be the 
government.

812
00:35:46,550 --> 00:35:47,383
I think there should be like some sort 
of an independent company that works in 

813
00:35:52,550 --> 00:35:57,550
a very scientific way where you know,
you can hire them to test your stuff and

814
00:35:58,251 --> 00:35:59,084
run these tests where you can show 
there's gotta be some way to show that 

815
00:36:03,081 --> 00:36:08,081
there's no collusion and there's no 
bribery that everything's above board.

816
00:36:09,590 --> 00:36:12,170
But I dunno what the fuck that would be.
I don't know how that would be.

817
00:36:12,230 --> 00:36:13,220
I'm not sure how it would work.

818
00:36:13,560 --> 00:36:17,010
I mean it's like I know the FDA has 
issues.

819
00:36:17,011 --> 00:36:20,220
I know that drug approval definitely has
issues.

820
00:36:20,221 --> 00:36:22,200
Like there have been drugs that have 
been passed that have had issues,

821
00:36:22,201 --> 00:36:23,034
but

822
00:36:23,110 --> 00:36:24,550
the fentanyl,
that's all you need to know.

823
00:36:24,551 --> 00:36:25,384
They saw oxycontin and fentanyl and 
people are prescribing shit that takes 

824
00:36:28,331 --> 00:36:32,020
forever for people to get off a massive 
addiction rates.

825
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:35,720
Things like fentanyl have some,
some very limited purpose.

826
00:36:35,810 --> 00:36:39,220
Just like I've been put on fentanyl for 
a pre surgery before.

827
00:36:39,300 --> 00:36:40,133
Just,
you know,

828
00:36:40,180 --> 00:36:42,520
they put you on it just to put you out.
Let's get this check.

829
00:36:42,530 --> 00:36:43,363
Highs.
I remember about 30 seconds and I was 

830
00:36:46,121 --> 00:36:48,550
told I threw up a while.
It was under.

831
00:36:48,551 --> 00:36:49,660
Um,
and I don't remember.

832
00:36:49,720 --> 00:36:51,520
Yeah.
Now I know that I can't have fentanyl,

833
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:53,200
but it's,
that was,

834
00:36:53,201 --> 00:36:55,420
they just put you on to put you out.
But that's like,

835
00:36:55,421 --> 00:36:58,840
that's one of very few ethical 
applications of,

836
00:36:58,900 --> 00:37:00,220
of fentanyl.
And I mean,

837
00:37:00,221 --> 00:37:01,054
it depends on,
like I did my master's thesis on 

838
00:37:03,041 --> 00:37:05,560
prescription opioid abuse trends and 
toxicology.

839
00:37:05,561 --> 00:37:06,394
So this is,
this is a spirit that I know pretty 

840
00:37:07,391 --> 00:37:07,930
well,
uh,

841
00:37:07,930 --> 00:37:08,763
but this is a,
that's kind of one of the things with 

842
00:37:11,080 --> 00:37:11,913
painkillers is that there's,
there are ethical prescribing practice 

843
00:37:14,531 --> 00:37:15,364
with their ethical ways to manage a 
patient use of it and then they're 

844
00:37:20,230 --> 00:37:24,880
really horribly unethical ways that it 
can be prescribed and managed over time.

845
00:37:25,090 --> 00:37:27,910
And this is something that the FDA 
hasn't managed well.

846
00:37:27,911 --> 00:37:31,330
This is something that a lot of doctors 
haven't managed well and it's like we,

847
00:37:31,331 --> 00:37:32,164
I mean we started this when we were,
when they were like let's go on a 

848
00:37:34,751 --> 00:37:35,584
marketing campaign.
Bureaucracy gone down and it just kept 

849
00:37:38,171 --> 00:37:41,370
getting worse from there.
It was like there's,

850
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:42,993
there has to be a better way to manage 
what we're doing right now with it and 

851
00:37:45,611 --> 00:37:47,410
it's not being done yet.

852
00:37:47,530 --> 00:37:50,430
So obviously this has nothing to do with
Gwyneth paltrow goop,

853
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:51,313
but I just think that they're some sort 
of an independent company or some sort 

854
00:37:54,731 --> 00:37:55,450
of.
I mean,

855
00:37:55,450 --> 00:37:57,400
naughty,
I keep saying business,

856
00:37:57,401 --> 00:37:58,234
but there's so many problems with doing 
that and there's also problems with 

857
00:38:00,641 --> 00:38:01,474
having the government do it.
I just don't think they'd been adequate 

858
00:38:02,801 --> 00:38:07,801
so far and the FDA stepping in and 
regulating all vitamins and,

859
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:09,730
and making,
you know,

860
00:38:09,731 --> 00:38:12,520
they wanted to do that for a while.
They wanted to call them nutraceuticals.

861
00:38:12,521 --> 00:38:13,600
They wanted to,
um,

862
00:38:13,960 --> 00:38:17,740
to have prescriptions for vitamins and 
things along those lines.

863
00:38:17,741 --> 00:38:18,574
But the problem with that is I don't 
want to have to go to the doctor to get 

864
00:38:20,471 --> 00:38:21,304
multivitamins,
but I do want to make sure that the 

865
00:38:22,691 --> 00:38:24,970
multivitamins that I get are pure or 
safe,

866
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:28,330
not just safe,
but that what you're asking for,

867
00:38:28,331 --> 00:38:30,700
are you looking for be 12?
I want to make sure I'm getting be 12.

868
00:38:31,290 --> 00:38:32,123
The other question is how much of a 
vitamin D you need and I think that buy 

869
00:38:36,371 --> 00:38:37,204
vitamins indiscriminately because we 
really don't like the average person 

870
00:38:39,701 --> 00:38:42,220
doesn't need to take a multivitamin in 
the day if they're eating,

871
00:38:42,490 --> 00:38:43,323
you know,
a healthy diet because you get pretty 

872
00:38:44,981 --> 00:38:45,814
much what you need on a daily basis.
If you're not somebody with an 

873
00:38:47,831 --> 00:38:50,390
absorption issue,
if you're not somebody with a,

874
00:38:50,470 --> 00:38:51,303
any like any dietary issues,
you're generally getting what you need 

875
00:38:53,951 --> 00:38:55,220
out of your diet.
Um,

876
00:38:55,230 --> 00:38:58,000
I think people do need to.
If your diet is really healthy,

877
00:38:58,001 --> 00:38:58,834
it's.
But most people do not have a really 

878
00:39:00,161 --> 00:39:00,994
healthy diet.
Most people are getting about what they 

879
00:39:03,131 --> 00:39:05,530
need out of their diet.
Most people seriously,

880
00:39:06,140 --> 00:39:06,973
it's,
I mean if we have some of the poorest 

881
00:39:09,070 --> 00:39:11,170
people are just eating processed 
bullshit.

882
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:12,033
Well No,
it's even if you go to the doctor and 

883
00:39:13,001 --> 00:39:15,910
get an average person,
I'm guessing you eat fairly healthy,

884
00:39:16,710 --> 00:39:17,543
but the average person that they go to 
the doctor to see if they're deficient 

885
00:39:19,721 --> 00:39:20,950
on everything,
on anything,

886
00:39:20,980 --> 00:39:22,350
they're not going to be deficient.

887
00:39:22,650 --> 00:39:25,870
I've gone and gotten my blood work done 
several times.

888
00:39:26,430 --> 00:39:30,200
Deficiencies and deficiencies in Vitamin
D.

889
00:39:30,300 --> 00:39:30,700
No,
I,

890
00:39:30,700 --> 00:39:31,533
I've been before.
But that was right when I was diagnosed 

891
00:39:32,681 --> 00:39:34,300
with CELIAC disease.
So I was,

892
00:39:34,940 --> 00:39:37,420
I was deficient at a few things.
But you know,

893
00:39:37,421 --> 00:39:38,254
that's,
that's an issue with wheat and you have 

894
00:39:39,511 --> 00:39:41,400
an issue absorbing food.
Yeah.

895
00:39:41,410 --> 00:39:43,240
So I mean now it will.
Now that I've been,

896
00:39:43,320 --> 00:39:44,260
it's,
it was,

897
00:39:44,540 --> 00:39:45,373
I was at the skinniest point in my life 
and then I stopped eating wheat and I 

898
00:39:47,561 --> 00:39:50,410
gained weight.
So because suddenly you're,

899
00:39:50,420 --> 00:39:51,790
you're kind of,
you know,

900
00:39:51,791 --> 00:39:52,624
they,
they heal and you're able to absorb 

901
00:39:54,611 --> 00:39:55,380
calories.
Again.

902
00:39:55,380 --> 00:39:56,213
I have a friend who's got a son who they
was trying to figure out why he was so 

903
00:39:58,661 --> 00:39:59,730
small.
He just,

904
00:39:59,820 --> 00:40:02,500
he couldn't eat and he was never hungry 
and he was eating,

905
00:40:02,501 --> 00:40:03,334
you might get sick here.
Everything is miserable and he's got a 

906
00:40:05,951 --> 00:40:07,290
wheat allergy.

907
00:40:07,290 --> 00:40:09,380
He's got a corn allergy.
Jesus,

908
00:40:09,670 --> 00:40:11,110
everything was just making him 
miserable.

909
00:40:12,050 --> 00:40:13,930
I mean,
I got quote unquote lucky.

910
00:40:13,931 --> 00:40:15,820
I only got symptoms when I was in 
adults.

911
00:40:16,080 --> 00:40:17,350
Uh,
and it was,

912
00:40:17,351 --> 00:40:18,184
you know,
you ate wheat all throughout your 

913
00:40:19,331 --> 00:40:20,590
childhood years.
No problem,

914
00:40:20,591 --> 00:40:23,340
no problem.
And I mean I was even overweight as,

915
00:40:23,341 --> 00:40:25,690
as a kid.
So then when I was an adult,

916
00:40:25,691 --> 00:40:29,470
suddenly horrible symptoms showed up.
It just doesn't work.

917
00:40:29,680 --> 00:40:33,160
What do they have an idea of a celiac 
can show up,

918
00:40:33,161 --> 00:40:34,110
are the symptoms of.
It can,

919
00:40:34,220 --> 00:40:38,300
like you always have the underlying 
physiology or um,

920
00:40:38,320 --> 00:40:39,153
and just all of a sudden symptoms can 
just show up out of the blue line 

921
00:40:41,530 --> 00:40:43,380
dormant and then all of a sudden it 
becomes active.

922
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:44,993
I had a bunch of health decisions 
because to kind of show up in my 

923
00:40:46,391 --> 00:40:48,470
twenties and I mean I started,
I'm like alright,

924
00:40:48,540 --> 00:40:49,960
I got to start taking care of myself.

925
00:40:49,960 --> 00:40:52,120
Started going to the gym,
run a few marathons,

926
00:40:52,121 --> 00:40:55,780
lost a lot of weight and like even when 
I was suddenly at a healthy weight,

927
00:40:55,781 --> 00:40:59,510
it was like I couldn't stop losing 
weight because my mate,

928
00:40:59,560 --> 00:41:01,840
my intestines just weren't absorbing 
anything.

929
00:41:01,841 --> 00:41:02,674
And that's not a,
that's not a thing you see coming or 

930
00:41:04,361 --> 00:41:07,420
like I'm at a healthy wise and this 
stopping and it was,

931
00:41:07,660 --> 00:41:08,890
it was not good.
But you know,

932
00:41:08,891 --> 00:41:11,230
eventually it was funny because the 
gluten trend,

933
00:41:11,380 --> 00:41:14,680
how or the anti gluten trend had already
showed up and a doctor suggested to me,

934
00:41:14,681 --> 00:41:17,230
well have you tried going gluten free?
And I'm like,

935
00:41:17,231 --> 00:41:21,340
oh that's a silly fad.
Three months later diagnosed with CELIAC

936
00:41:21,341 --> 00:41:21,941
disease.
I'm like,

937
00:41:21,941 --> 00:41:24,160
if I hadn't been so skeptical of 
everything,

938
00:41:24,180 --> 00:41:25,013
think gluten free is a fad.
I don't think gluten is the best thing 

939
00:41:27,281 --> 00:41:29,980
for your body.
It's okay every now and then,

940
00:41:30,230 --> 00:41:34,310
but I think that essentially what you're
getting when you're processed grains

941
00:41:34,310 --> 00:41:36,180
is you're getting something.
Your body's kind.

942
00:41:36,310 --> 00:41:37,143
It's kind of alien.
The bondo doesn't exactly know what to 

943
00:41:38,361 --> 00:41:38,730
do with it.

944
00:41:38,730 --> 00:41:39,510
Well,
there doesn't seem.

945
00:41:39,510 --> 00:41:41,460
Here's things.
Tests keeps showing.

946
00:41:41,461 --> 00:41:43,620
There doesn't seem to be a problem with 
gluten.

947
00:41:43,621 --> 00:41:45,980
If you don't have celiac disease and 
it's

948
00:41:46,230 --> 00:41:49,470
what does that mean by a problem?
Is it like for optimizing your health?

949
00:41:49,590 --> 00:41:52,410
Is it something that you should have in 
your diet all the time,

950
00:41:52,411 --> 00:41:55,580
or is it something that mean it really 
does convert to sugar.

951
00:41:56,770 --> 00:41:57,603
Everything converts to sugar.
Your body converts everything in some 

952
00:42:00,521 --> 00:42:02,440
way,
shape or form into usable fuel,

953
00:42:02,441 --> 00:42:06,230
and the usable fuel is eventually 
glucose or Nad Ph.

954
00:42:06,520 --> 00:42:07,353
there's everything in your body gets 
converted to sugar when you use do you 

955
00:42:10,690 --> 00:42:10,990
feel,

956
00:42:10,990 --> 00:42:13,990
but if you eat a piece of salmon or if 
you had a bowl of pasta,

957
00:42:13,991 --> 00:42:16,780
it's a very different reaction how your 
body absorbs these two things.

958
00:42:17,110 --> 00:42:18,190
It's a,
yes,

959
00:42:18,191 --> 00:42:19,024
this is,
this is true because all calories 

960
00:42:19,781 --> 00:42:20,614
aren't,
aren't the same as they both get 

961
00:42:21,821 --> 00:42:22,654
absorbed to sugar,
but avoiding gluten and switching over 

962
00:42:25,301 --> 00:42:26,700
to say,
uh,

963
00:42:26,740 --> 00:42:27,940
you know,
all rice,

964
00:42:28,130 --> 00:42:28,963
uh,
isn't,

965
00:42:29,130 --> 00:42:29,963
you know,
that's not going to change a for that 

966
00:42:32,021 --> 00:42:32,854
all that much in your body in terms of 
what's in terms of the biochemical 

967
00:42:35,741 --> 00:42:38,500
mischief and unless you have a gluten 
allergy,

968
00:42:38,860 --> 00:42:41,520
like that's none of that yet

969
00:42:41,700 --> 00:42:44,190
the sensitivities.
But there's also a level.

970
00:42:44,191 --> 00:42:45,001
So that too,
right?

971
00:42:45,001 --> 00:42:46,900
Like there's some people where it's like
mildly,

972
00:42:46,920 --> 00:42:50,330
minorly irritating and there's some 
people that have extreme issues with it.

973
00:42:50,580 --> 00:42:52,140
Well,
here's at this point,

974
00:42:52,141 --> 00:42:54,570
and this is why I always say at this 
point in our scientific knowledge,

975
00:42:54,600 --> 00:42:57,090
scientific knowledge can evolve and we 
can learn new things.

976
00:42:57,340 --> 00:42:57,900
Uh,
you know,

977
00:42:57,900 --> 00:43:00,630
at one point the thing that started off 
the whole gluten trend,

978
00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:02,640
uh,
was a kind of poorly,

979
00:43:02,700 --> 00:43:03,533
a poorly designed study where they had a
small sample size of people and they 

980
00:43:07,231 --> 00:43:08,800
designed it just to test,
you know,

981
00:43:08,820 --> 00:43:11,550
gluten versus a non,
a diet without gluten.

982
00:43:11,820 --> 00:43:15,390
And they came to the conclusion that 
about 20 percent of people just based on

983
00:43:15,391 --> 00:43:20,280
this very small study had a bad reaction
to gluten and well,

984
00:43:20,370 --> 00:43:24,210
these people came in saying they had 
stomach problems.

985
00:43:24,450 --> 00:43:25,283
Now these people,
it turned out they looked at it and 

986
00:43:26,851 --> 00:43:27,684
said,
there's no.

987
00:43:27,690 --> 00:43:29,730
There's no.
Afterwards assigned to saul sat back and

988
00:43:29,731 --> 00:43:30,564
said,
why we're only about one percent of 

989
00:43:32,101 --> 00:43:33,930
people having celiac disease.

990
00:43:33,930 --> 00:43:34,763
And then all of a sudden 20 percent of 
people are running around like glutens 

991
00:43:37,051 --> 00:43:39,360
making their Dick flies off a fly off.
This is,

992
00:43:39,480 --> 00:43:40,313
there's something up here.
So they made a better design study and 

993
00:43:42,961 --> 00:43:44,490
they took out common core.
They did,

994
00:43:44,491 --> 00:43:46,170
you know,
Kinda double blind did a,

995
00:43:46,270 --> 00:43:47,103
a better design.
Instead of just say we're going to take 

996
00:43:48,151 --> 00:43:48,984
out all these other causes of 
gastrointestinal distress and we're 

997
00:43:51,991 --> 00:43:55,140
going to try and make this double blind,
and they figured out it was the fodmap,

998
00:43:55,141 --> 00:43:55,974
so it was there were these short chain 
illegal saccharide second pull water 

999
00:43:58,861 --> 00:43:59,694
into the gut and cause some 
gastrointestinal distress and it was 

1000
00:44:01,891 --> 00:44:02,724
really closer to between like one and 
about five percent of people that were 

1001
00:44:05,761 --> 00:44:09,930
having any issues with gluten.
Now the problem is that what was causing

1002
00:44:09,931 --> 00:44:12,630
that though,
the gastrointestinal distress in the.

1003
00:44:12,970 --> 00:44:13,803
In the one to five percent,
so one percent is celiac disease for 

1004
00:44:16,561 --> 00:44:16,860
sure.

1005
00:44:16,860 --> 00:44:17,760
One percent.
Yeah.

1006
00:44:18,630 --> 00:44:19,463
His across the board with people.
One percent is celiac that is fairly 

1007
00:44:22,681 --> 00:44:23,514
high.
Now here's the thing that that higher 

1008
00:44:24,601 --> 00:44:25,434
percent of people that two to five.
Here's the question now they're still 

1009
00:44:28,231 --> 00:44:31,890
trying to figure out why some people 
seem to have an with gluten.

1010
00:44:32,310 --> 00:44:33,121
Now,
I could be wrong on.

1011
00:44:33,121 --> 00:44:35,610
This is just off the top of my head what
I remember from the study,

1012
00:44:35,611 --> 00:44:38,580
but I've had to it a few times,
so I think my knowledge is accurate.

1013
00:44:39,510 --> 00:44:41,670
Feel free to fact check me out at home,
um,

1014
00:44:41,760 --> 00:44:42,840
but the,
um,

1015
00:44:43,380 --> 00:44:44,213
the thing with those extra percent,
they're trying to figure out why they 

1016
00:44:46,471 --> 00:44:48,810
might have an issue with gluten because 
they,

1017
00:44:48,811 --> 00:44:50,340
you know,
like wheat is,

1018
00:44:50,370 --> 00:44:52,110
you know,
you think of it as a carb heavy thing,

1019
00:44:52,111 --> 00:44:53,940
right?
And gluten is a protein,

1020
00:44:54,540 --> 00:44:55,373
so that other few percentage of people,
they're trying to figure out why the 

1021
00:44:57,961 --> 00:45:00,630
gluten a does it because gluten is in a 
few other things.

1022
00:45:00,630 --> 00:45:03,060
It's in barley,
raw and rye.

1023
00:45:03,350 --> 00:45:06,420
Uh,
so what they figured out is that this is

1024
00:45:06,421 --> 00:45:11,100
the going theory right now.
Gluten can cause a small,

1025
00:45:11,130 --> 00:45:11,963
uh,
a reaction in the stomach where you 

1026
00:45:13,621 --> 00:45:17,010
produce this protein called Zonulin that
can cause an increase in inflammation.

1027
00:45:17,340 --> 00:45:18,990
This seems to be,
and this is what I,

1028
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:21,090
this has only been one study that I've 
read on it.

1029
00:45:21,330 --> 00:45:23,820
It seems to be relatively new.
They're still looking into it.

1030
00:45:23,821 --> 00:45:24,654
So there's a chance that people might be
in the two to five percent that can 

1031
00:45:27,391 --> 00:45:28,980
handle it because of that.
Um,

1032
00:45:28,981 --> 00:45:32,220
it could be another component of the 
wheat barley,

1033
00:45:32,690 --> 00:45:35,610
rye that's causing it,
but gluten in and of itself,

1034
00:45:35,611 --> 00:45:36,550
it's not,
you know,

1035
00:45:36,630 --> 00:45:41,630
it's unless you are one of those people 
that has an actual reaction to it,

1036
00:45:42,030 --> 00:45:43,380
perfectly fine,
go on to have,

1037
00:45:43,410 --> 00:45:44,430
you know,
go have a sandwich.

1038
00:45:44,910 --> 00:45:45,870
So,
but you know,

1039
00:45:45,990 --> 00:45:48,340
if you want one,
but I,

1040
00:45:48,390 --> 00:45:49,223
you know,
I cut back my carbs pretty heavily over 

1041
00:45:51,061 --> 00:45:53,970
the last couple years and I've had 
really good results whether it's,

1042
00:45:53,971 --> 00:45:55,830
I mean if you're someone who's trying to
build muscle,

1043
00:45:55,890 --> 00:45:56,723
you know,
I just think that just eventually it 

1044
00:45:59,550 --> 00:46:00,600
becomes too much sugar.

1045
00:46:00,660 --> 00:46:03,160
So much sugar in your body if you're 
eating a lot number.

1046
00:46:03,180 --> 00:46:04,013
Back when you said that food pyramid and
the bottom of the food pyramid was all 

1047
00:46:06,210 --> 00:46:07,043
breads.
I mean that's kind of interesting 

1048
00:46:09,091 --> 00:46:11,850
because that's like stealing like Dr 
Seuss books that are read to my kids.

1049
00:46:11,851 --> 00:46:12,421
It's like,
wow,

1050
00:46:12,421 --> 00:46:13,254
they haven't figured this out yet.
It was supposed to eat that much bread 

1051
00:46:15,901 --> 00:46:18,060
and pasta.
It's not supposed to be the most thing.

1052
00:46:18,300 --> 00:46:19,110
It's.
And it's funny.

1053
00:46:19,110 --> 00:46:20,920
I think one of the funny parts of that 
is,

1054
00:46:21,390 --> 00:46:23,400
is that back in the day when that was 
made,

1055
00:46:23,401 --> 00:46:25,710
I think slices of bread were much 
smaller.

1056
00:46:26,630 --> 00:46:27,570
I think I,
I,

1057
00:46:27,710 --> 00:46:28,543
I think that's part of it because I just
think people didn't know as much back 

1058
00:46:30,391 --> 00:46:31,520
then as well.
I think that's part.

1059
00:46:31,590 --> 00:46:33,240
I think there are a few things that are 
going on with that.

1060
00:46:33,241 --> 00:46:35,570
One is that we're really bad at counting
calories and we,

1061
00:46:35,571 --> 00:46:36,404
uh,
we were chatting a little bit before he 

1062
00:46:36,931 --> 00:46:37,764
showed up,
um,

1063
00:46:38,040 --> 00:46:41,100
is that there are,
they now have a way of tracking how many

1064
00:46:41,101 --> 00:46:44,970
calories people had taken a day through 
this drink that can,

1065
00:46:44,990 --> 00:46:46,290
uh,
I forget exactly how it works,

1066
00:46:46,291 --> 00:46:47,124
but you can take a drink and it will 
count the number of calories you've had 

1067
00:46:49,411 --> 00:46:50,910
in about the last 24 hours.

1068
00:46:51,660 --> 00:46:54,450
And they've found there's this,
I forget,

1069
00:46:54,451 --> 00:46:55,860
I forget exactly how it works.
It's,

1070
00:46:55,861 --> 00:46:58,380
I'll find,
I'll shoot you the article after this,

1071
00:46:58,381 --> 00:47:00,000
but this was a,
they,

1072
00:47:00,330 --> 00:47:01,260
it was,
God,

1073
00:47:01,261 --> 00:47:02,910
I need to find this article.
But it was,

1074
00:47:02,950 --> 00:47:04,050
they,
they could do this.

1075
00:47:04,051 --> 00:47:07,200
And they were tracking how registered 
Dietitians versus,

1076
00:47:07,230 --> 00:47:08,063
uh,
you know,

1077
00:47:08,100 --> 00:47:10,350
average Joe would,
you know,

1078
00:47:10,351 --> 00:47:11,690
could Qa because they were,
you know,

1079
00:47:11,770 --> 00:47:13,740
you count down how many calories you had
an a day,

1080
00:47:14,070 --> 00:47:15,750
a registered dietician who,
you know,

1081
00:47:15,751 --> 00:47:16,584
really well trained on dietetic type 
stuff versus average person counting 

1082
00:47:20,311 --> 00:47:21,144
their calories.
The dietitian was off by about 200 

1083
00:47:22,711 --> 00:47:23,544
calories.
A average person was off by about 500 

1084
00:47:26,270 --> 00:47:28,320
interact with our guests about what they
were.

1085
00:47:28,321 --> 00:47:30,430
I mean,
they were talking to bad 100,

1086
00:47:30,431 --> 00:47:31,264
over several thousand,
which is what most people think about 

1087
00:47:34,451 --> 00:47:35,284
it.
If you're trying to lose weight and 

1088
00:47:35,711 --> 00:47:39,120
you're the average person and you're off
by 500 calories and that's how.

1089
00:47:39,121 --> 00:47:40,280
And you're supposed to,
you know,

1090
00:47:40,300 --> 00:47:42,280
in the course of a week to lose one 
pound,

1091
00:47:42,281 --> 00:47:45,370
you're supposed to have a 500 calorie 
caloric deficit.

1092
00:47:45,670 --> 00:47:47,830
There's your deficit.
It's not there anymore.

1093
00:47:48,040 --> 00:47:51,760
So people are really bad at tracking 
their calories and they're really bad at

1094
00:47:51,761 --> 00:47:52,594
knowing what a portion size is.
So one of the best ways I've seen from 

1095
00:47:55,570 --> 00:47:56,403
the personal trainers that I,
that I confer with is weighing out your 

1096
00:47:59,231 --> 00:48:01,060
food.
It's much harder to make a mistake.

1097
00:48:01,250 --> 00:48:02,083
That is a good way.
Another way is there's a bunch of 

1098
00:48:03,601 --> 00:48:05,700
companies,
I don't have any affiliation with any of

1099
00:48:05,701 --> 00:48:06,534
them,
but there's a bunch of companies that 

1100
00:48:06,931 --> 00:48:11,490
make prepackaged meals that are healthy 
and they.

1101
00:48:11,580 --> 00:48:12,413
They'll tell you exactly what the 
portion sizes are and exactly how many 

1102
00:48:15,151 --> 00:48:15,984
calories are in and what the nutrients 
are in and are in that package and 

1103
00:48:19,381 --> 00:48:21,360
that's a good way to do it too.
So there's no guesswork.

1104
00:48:21,410 --> 00:48:22,243
Yeah,
and it's,

1105
00:48:22,340 --> 00:48:23,173
here's one of the other things like I 
don't think carbs as you know in and of 

1106
00:48:25,821 --> 00:48:26,654
themselves are evil.
I think you have to burn what you take 

1107
00:48:28,341 --> 00:48:29,810
in.
You have to balance your carbs,

1108
00:48:29,811 --> 00:48:30,920
your fats,
your proteins,

1109
00:48:31,220 --> 00:48:34,700
and you'll be okay and it really depends
on what you're doing for exercise.

1110
00:48:34,701 --> 00:48:38,270
And a lot of people overestimate how 
much they move under our under.

1111
00:48:38,310 --> 00:48:39,650
Yeah,
overestimate how much they move,

1112
00:48:39,651 --> 00:48:40,484
underestimate how much they eat and like
I'm friends with a lot of people in the 

1113
00:48:43,191 --> 00:48:44,024
fitness community,
a lot of weight lifters and depends on 

1114
00:48:46,671 --> 00:48:48,190
what they're doing.
If they're on a bulk,

1115
00:48:48,230 --> 00:48:50,090
there'll their calories will go up to 
3000.

1116
00:48:50,091 --> 00:48:50,990
If they're on a cut,
they're like,

1117
00:48:50,991 --> 00:48:53,660
I'm on like,
I'm on poverty carbs right now.

1118
00:48:53,661 --> 00:48:56,070
So it's like 50 carbs over the course 
that you're talking about.

1119
00:48:56,100 --> 00:48:57,110
Bodybuilding.
Oh yeah.

1120
00:48:57,140 --> 00:48:57,973
It's so unhealthy.
It's crazy that we think of that as a 

1121
00:49:01,101 --> 00:49:03,670
healthy thing.
It's funny because like during the,

1122
00:49:03,690 --> 00:49:06,230
like the year when they're not training 
for a competition,

1123
00:49:06,231 --> 00:49:09,500
it looks fine and then when they're like
six weeks out from a competition,

1124
00:49:09,501 --> 00:49:11,870
it's like they're like,
I have a cup of water a day.

1125
00:49:11,871 --> 00:49:12,150
I'm like,

1126
00:49:12,150 --> 00:49:14,100
how are you?
This is not good for you.

1127
00:49:14,430 --> 00:49:15,263
Well,
it's not good for them during the time 

1128
00:49:16,501 --> 00:49:18,640
where they're cutting and treading and 
that's what I'm talking about.

1129
00:49:18,641 --> 00:49:19,474
Like when you see a bodybuilder onstage 
and they're shredded and they have zero 

1130
00:49:23,041 --> 00:49:23,874
body made it down to like probably like 
three or four percent or some time for 

1131
00:49:26,931 --> 00:49:28,410
water.
So unhealthy.

1132
00:49:28,440 --> 00:49:30,600
It's like they're,
they're literally on death's door,

1133
00:49:30,601 --> 00:49:32,580
but they look amazing.
Like the shredded.

1134
00:49:32,581 --> 00:49:36,750
You can see every last in you and fiber 
of their muscle,

1135
00:49:36,751 --> 00:49:40,620
but that's a someone who's like in a 
really bad place.

1136
00:49:40,630 --> 00:49:44,590
Kidneys are like that close to passing 
to to go and away.

1137
00:49:44,591 --> 00:49:45,424
It's not good.

1138
00:49:45,530 --> 00:49:49,670
It's definitely not good for your body 
when they're in that performance zone.

1139
00:49:49,700 --> 00:49:52,280
It's so weird that that's what we really
enjoy.

1140
00:49:52,281 --> 00:49:53,114
Looking at those.

1141
00:49:53,360 --> 00:49:54,710
The rest of the year though,
they eat.

1142
00:49:54,711 --> 00:49:57,090
I mean it's,
my trainer is a,

1143
00:49:57,091 --> 00:49:57,924
uh,
is a bodybuilder and it's like what he 

1144
00:49:58,731 --> 00:50:01,160
has me on for,
for weight loss.

1145
00:50:01,161 --> 00:50:03,950
Isn't that crazy?
It's about 1600 calories a day.

1146
00:50:04,220 --> 00:50:08,630
I'm a fairly okay balance of proteins,
carbs and fats.

1147
00:50:08,631 --> 00:50:09,464
And it's like,
at first he had me on a much higher 

1148
00:50:10,821 --> 00:50:12,810
amount of carbs.
I'm not losing builder.

1149
00:50:12,811 --> 00:50:14,730
And you want to,
he a dietician?

1150
00:50:15,080 --> 00:50:15,830
No,
but I've,

1151
00:50:15,830 --> 00:50:16,663
uh,
wait,

1152
00:50:16,680 --> 00:50:17,511
uh,
no,

1153
00:50:17,511 --> 00:50:20,480
but I have consulted with a Dietitian 
too because I have these,

1154
00:50:20,600 --> 00:50:21,433
you know,
these are the people I consult with for 

1155
00:50:21,951 --> 00:50:23,540
my writing and they were like,
yeah,

1156
00:50:23,541 --> 00:50:24,740
that looks all right.
You're not,

1157
00:50:24,741 --> 00:50:27,650
you're not anything crazy.
And it's because of my height and weight

1158
00:50:27,651 --> 00:50:29,520
that I started with.
At first he had me at 1800.

1159
00:50:29,550 --> 00:50:31,190
I'm like,
I'm not quite losing here.

1160
00:50:31,660 --> 00:50:32,493
And he's like,
let's go down another couple hundred 

1161
00:50:33,560 --> 00:50:36,530
dollars.
So it's the way they started out with is

1162
00:50:36,531 --> 00:50:37,191
always,
you know,

1163
00:50:37,191 --> 00:50:40,340
your wait times 10 and then they bust up
the carbs,

1164
00:50:40,341 --> 00:50:41,570
proteins,
fats from there.

1165
00:50:41,840 --> 00:50:42,591
Um,
and you know,

1166
00:50:42,591 --> 00:50:44,690
if you need to adjust,
go from,

1167
00:50:44,710 --> 00:50:45,531
you know,
go from there.

1168
00:50:45,531 --> 00:50:47,470
And it's like it started with lifting 
because I,

1169
00:50:47,520 --> 00:50:48,353
you know,
because I've screwed up my joints so 

1170
00:50:49,701 --> 00:50:51,410
badly for the amount of running I've 
done that,

1171
00:50:51,411 --> 00:50:52,100
I'm like,
all right,

1172
00:50:52,100 --> 00:50:54,920
I will try weight lifting and it's been 
kind of fun.

1173
00:50:54,921 --> 00:50:57,500
I've enjoyed,
I've enjoyed learning how to do

1174
00:50:58,270 --> 00:50:59,103
so.
You screw your joints up from running 

1175
00:51:00,181 --> 00:51:01,470
but not from lifting weights.

1176
00:51:01,690 --> 00:51:03,470
Tim has been a little easier on my 
joints,

1177
00:51:04,220 --> 00:51:06,260
joints maybe.
I mean I have,

1178
00:51:06,320 --> 00:51:07,250
um,
it's a,

1179
00:51:07,280 --> 00:51:09,500
I have a kind of,
a bit of a joint condition.

1180
00:51:09,501 --> 00:51:11,360
So their condition,
it's they,

1181
00:51:11,410 --> 00:51:14,780
they pop out of the socket.
And was that from um,

1182
00:51:14,781 --> 00:51:15,740
it's a,
it's called.

1183
00:51:17,210 --> 00:51:19,370
You're hearing all of my medical stuff.
I apologize.

1184
00:51:19,371 --> 00:51:21,300
It's called Ehlers Danlos Syndrome.
Do you,

1185
00:51:21,810 --> 00:51:24,140
do you want to see it or no?
You can do it.

1186
00:51:24,180 --> 00:51:25,720
Yeah,
I can pop my shoulder halfway out.

1187
00:51:25,721 --> 00:51:26,450
Okay.
Um,

1188
00:51:26,450 --> 00:51:28,190
let's see.
So now most people when they stretch,

1189
00:51:28,191 --> 00:51:28,881
they stopped.
Like,

1190
00:51:28,881 --> 00:51:31,460
here,
let keep going.

1191
00:51:31,640 --> 00:51:32,580
Whoa.
Yeah.

1192
00:51:33,590 --> 00:51:34,423
But I've had like,
this one's had threesomes like your 

1193
00:51:36,231 --> 00:51:37,370
shoulders flexible.
Yeah.

1194
00:51:37,371 --> 00:51:38,204
But I mean there's a bunch of those 
locations if you can see it's popping a 

1195
00:51:40,791 --> 00:51:42,230
little bit right there,
but yeah,

1196
00:51:42,231 --> 00:51:44,240
it's like my hip hop's partway out 
depending on that.

1197
00:51:44,540 --> 00:51:45,373
I can't,
I can't really strengthened to keep it 

1198
00:51:48,081 --> 00:51:50,030
from happening.
The more weightlifting I do,

1199
00:51:50,031 --> 00:51:52,190
the less popping it does,
but it's been,

1200
00:51:52,191 --> 00:51:54,800
I mean this is way less bad than it was 
a few months ago before,

1201
00:51:54,801 --> 00:51:57,800
like you could visibly see the pop,
like you can still feel it,

1202
00:51:57,801 --> 00:51:58,634
but it's,
there's the problem with being hyper 

1203
00:52:01,301 --> 00:52:02,930
mobile like that is your,
uh,

1204
00:52:02,931 --> 00:52:06,380
you leave yourself open to a lot of 
different injuries from a,

1205
00:52:06,381 --> 00:52:07,214
you know,
from like basic movement can make 

1206
00:52:08,571 --> 00:52:09,890
something snap.
And it's,

1207
00:52:10,790 --> 00:52:11,590
this goes back

1208
00:52:11,590 --> 00:52:12,423
to what we're talking about when it 
comes to people that have back issues 

1209
00:52:15,490 --> 00:52:20,490
and one of the things that has been like
super beneficial for me is exercising my

1210
00:52:21,071 --> 00:52:21,904
back,
yoga and doing a bunch of different 

1211
00:52:25,451 --> 00:52:26,284
things,
stretching and making sure that my core 

1212
00:52:29,171 --> 00:52:34,171
and my spine are very strong and that's 
something that kind of gets ignored by a

1213
00:52:34,601 --> 00:52:35,434
lot of people that have back issues.
It's like one of the reasons why you 

1214
00:52:37,691 --> 00:52:38,524
probably have a back issue,
whether it's a herniated disc or a 

1215
00:52:40,511 --> 00:52:41,344
bulging disk,
is that your back is not strong enough 

1216
00:52:44,291 --> 00:52:47,050
to sustain whatever load you're putting 
on it.

1217
00:52:47,080 --> 00:52:47,913
Whatever exercise you're doing,
whatever movement you're doing that's 

1218
00:52:50,411 --> 00:52:51,244
causing it to pop out of place,
the issue is most likely that you are 

1219
00:52:54,851 --> 00:52:57,640
not strong enough.
And a lot of that comes from a sedentary

1220
00:52:57,641 --> 00:52:58,474
lifestyle,
comes from sitting at a desk all the 

1221
00:52:59,471 --> 00:53:01,330
time,
comes from poor posture.

1222
00:53:01,420 --> 00:53:02,253
There's a variety of different factors 
that are not addressed by chiropractors 

1223
00:53:06,311 --> 00:53:07,144
or by other people.
And if they are addressed by a 

1224
00:53:07,661 --> 00:53:08,494
chiropractor,
well that's one good thing that they're 

1225
00:53:09,611 --> 00:53:10,960
telling you.
I mean,

1226
00:53:11,040 --> 00:53:13,720
it still doesn't take away from where 
this whole thing started.

1227
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:14,940
Yeah.
And I mean it's not,

1228
00:53:15,060 --> 00:53:17,170
it's not always the case of back 
injuries come from that,

1229
00:53:17,171 --> 00:53:19,460
like sometimes it's just you did like 
your,

1230
00:53:19,461 --> 00:53:22,410
your disc was gonna degenerate that was 
written into,

1231
00:53:22,740 --> 00:53:24,860
that was written into your life like 
you're,

1232
00:53:25,130 --> 00:53:26,160
it's,
my boyfriend

1233
00:53:26,160 --> 00:53:30,810
did nothing to screw up his back and 
just a distorted degenerating and he was

1234
00:53:30,811 --> 00:53:31,644
a,
he was a rock climber and there was no 

1235
00:53:33,450 --> 00:53:35,160
known injury.
Just it happened.

1236
00:53:35,420 --> 00:53:36,253
Uh,
and you know,

1237
00:53:36,420 --> 00:53:38,640
like I'm.
How do you know that though,

1238
00:53:38,641 --> 00:53:41,060
when you're talking about someone having
an issue with their disc,

1239
00:53:41,061 --> 00:53:44,850
is it from continual use?
Is it because they're not stretching?

1240
00:53:44,851 --> 00:53:47,140
Is it because they didn't have enough 
strength in the back?

1241
00:53:47,240 --> 00:53:49,230
I mean,
those are all really valid questions and

1242
00:53:49,231 --> 00:53:51,510
it's like there's you,
you never know what,

1243
00:53:52,290 --> 00:53:54,570
you never know what's going to be the 
cause of it beforehand.

1244
00:53:54,571 --> 00:53:56,340
And that's why preventative medicine is 
hard.

1245
00:53:56,341 --> 00:53:58,800
But that's why I always say get to the 
gym and lift some weights.

1246
00:53:58,830 --> 00:54:02,670
It will at least if they're,
if you're someone who is prone to having

1247
00:54:02,671 --> 00:54:03,504
a backend issue issue because you know,
there are some people who are prone to 

1248
00:54:07,021 --> 00:54:08,910
it get,
what does that mean?

1249
00:54:09,870 --> 00:54:11,460
Why would they be prone to.
Well,

1250
00:54:11,461 --> 00:54:13,950
in my case I have scoliosis as a part of
the,

1251
00:54:13,951 --> 00:54:15,600
um,
as a part of Stan loads.

1252
00:54:15,620 --> 00:54:18,390
So that's,
that's why I say prone to it because you

1253
00:54:18,391 --> 00:54:19,224
don't,
a lot of times prone to disc 

1254
00:54:20,280 --> 00:54:21,113
degeneration.
It's someone would be prone to the 

1255
00:54:24,660 --> 00:54:26,280
degenerative disc disease.
I don't know.

1256
00:54:26,281 --> 00:54:27,380
I don't know if that's,
um,

1257
00:54:27,390 --> 00:54:28,170
actually I don't,
I,

1258
00:54:28,170 --> 00:54:31,020
I'm not sure if that's disputed thing.
Yeah,

1259
00:54:31,030 --> 00:54:31,863
I'm much,
I really don't know off the top of my 

1260
00:54:32,581 --> 00:54:34,130
head.
So I don't know if that's a,

1261
00:54:34,170 --> 00:54:35,940
if that's something that,
um,

1262
00:54:36,360 --> 00:54:37,193
that you're like,
if that's written into your dna or if 

1263
00:54:39,781 --> 00:54:42,100
that's something that you injure and it 
just gets worse.

1264
00:54:42,380 --> 00:54:43,680
That's a lot of it.
Yeah.

1265
00:54:43,760 --> 00:54:44,593
That's what I've been talking to people 
that work on people that have bulging 

1266
00:54:47,341 --> 00:54:48,174
discs and doctors that are.
I mean there's some new therapies that 

1267
00:54:50,671 --> 00:54:51,420
are doing for that now.

1268
00:54:51,420 --> 00:54:52,253
One of the things they're doing is 
they're injecting stem cells directly 

1269
00:54:54,331 --> 00:54:55,390
into the risks.
Yeah.

1270
00:54:55,410 --> 00:54:57,570
It's very new and they're doing it on 
some fighters.

1271
00:54:57,680 --> 00:55:00,090
Oh,
I'd love to see how that pans out.

1272
00:55:00,340 --> 00:55:01,173
Well,
they've got some really promising 

1273
00:55:01,651 --> 00:55:02,484
results.
Apparently they've just started it 

1274
00:55:04,021 --> 00:55:06,000
within the last six to eight months.
I mean,

1275
00:55:06,010 --> 00:55:06,843
like the,
the biggest issue I have is that I have 

1276
00:55:08,360 --> 00:55:09,193
A.
I mean it's not a bad enough case of 

1277
00:55:10,261 --> 00:55:13,860
scoliosis where I need surgery or a back
brace.

1278
00:55:14,040 --> 00:55:17,580
It's just enough to be inconvenient,
so it's like I'm.

1279
00:55:17,760 --> 00:55:20,910
My big thing I'm doing is all right.
If I can lift and keep my back strong,

1280
00:55:20,911 --> 00:55:23,010
it will stop me from having surgery 
eventually.

1281
00:55:23,011 --> 00:55:23,844
And back surgery is just,
almost never a good thing to hear 

1282
00:55:26,341 --> 00:55:29,910
because they're always there when you 
fix something surgically.

1283
00:55:30,120 --> 00:55:32,010
They're just almost always 
complications,

1284
00:55:32,011 --> 00:55:33,190
especially with your back on.

1285
00:55:33,190 --> 00:55:35,100
I'm like,
if I can keep rods out of my pack,

1286
00:55:35,130 --> 00:55:36,140
I'll be very happy.
Well,

1287
00:55:36,150 --> 00:55:36,983
you know,
I've had some surgeries that were very 

1288
00:55:37,741 --> 00:55:38,574
effective of knee reconstructions to 
both my knees been reconstructed with 

1289
00:55:41,901 --> 00:55:43,050
me.
It turned out great,

1290
00:55:43,290 --> 00:55:46,320
but I have had friends that have had 
some back issues,

1291
00:55:46,321 --> 00:55:47,760
especially fusions.
Oh,

1292
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:49,830
that had been a big,
big nightmare.

1293
00:55:49,870 --> 00:55:50,703
Yeah,
that's,

1294
00:55:50,790 --> 00:55:51,623
that's what I'd probably end up with 
[inaudible] like middle of my back and 

1295
00:55:53,581 --> 00:55:56,710
just kind of goes like,
this is not something I like.

1296
00:55:57,380 --> 00:55:58,450
Um,
I've,

1297
00:55:58,590 --> 00:55:59,423
I've been told it's something I love 
Yoga and I've been told it's not good 

1298
00:56:02,521 --> 00:56:04,050
for people with ehlers Danlos,
so I'm like,

1299
00:56:04,051 --> 00:56:07,260
I don't have been told that by my,
my rheumatologist.

1300
00:56:07,261 --> 00:56:08,390
And it's like,
that's like,

1301
00:56:08,610 --> 00:56:10,290
but I,
there are still some yoga moves.

1302
00:56:10,291 --> 00:56:11,124
I do just be at the end of my workout 
because they feel they feel great to 

1303
00:56:14,851 --> 00:56:17,940
stretch out my back and they feel like 
they strengthen my core quite a bit.

1304
00:56:17,940 --> 00:56:22,570
So they say it's bad for you because of 
how like because of how hyper mobile am,

1305
00:56:22,571 --> 00:56:23,404
like it's I'll do downward dog and it 
doesn't even feel like it stretches me 

1306
00:56:27,431 --> 00:56:32,431
because I'm a hyper because I'm so Flexi
to start with and that makes sense.

1307
00:56:32,471 --> 00:56:35,470
But you still strengthening those 
muscles to support your spine.

1308
00:56:35,471 --> 00:56:36,304
What would that be?
Bad.

1309
00:56:36,630 --> 00:56:39,580
I got nothing.
I can deadlift and you can't do yoga.

1310
00:56:39,581 --> 00:56:42,190
That seems ridiculous.
It doesn't make any sense at all.

1311
00:56:42,191 --> 00:56:45,520
Welcome to a really weird disorder.
This is what it is.

1312
00:56:45,521 --> 00:56:46,354
Or is it?
Doctors don't really exactly know what 

1313
00:56:47,621 --> 00:56:50,800
the fuck they're talking about because 
there's a lot of doctors you get injured

1314
00:56:50,801 --> 00:56:51,221
and they're like,
well,

1315
00:56:51,221 --> 00:56:54,070
you got to stop doing anything.
It's an inside thing where it's like Los

1316
00:56:54,070 --> 00:56:57,440
Angeles is a Weirdo disorder.
Like your basically your Collagen is not

1317
00:56:57,730 --> 00:57:00,400
able to heal itself or stay kind of in 
shape,

1318
00:57:00,420 --> 00:57:01,840
uh,
as it used to.

1319
00:57:01,840 --> 00:57:04,930
Or as a kid,
a deadlift deadlift has been fine.

1320
00:57:05,020 --> 00:57:05,620
Like,
I,

1321
00:57:05,620 --> 00:57:07,180
I got it.
It's partially,

1322
00:57:07,181 --> 00:57:08,014
you know,
you're,

1323
00:57:08,280 --> 00:57:11,550
it's personally that you're not 
stretching,

1324
00:57:11,570 --> 00:57:13,870
you're,
you're strengthening or your.

1325
00:57:13,930 --> 00:57:15,370
I don't know how else to phrase it.
You're not,

1326
00:57:15,910 --> 00:57:18,490
you're not stretching your body into 
weird positions.

1327
00:57:18,491 --> 00:57:19,260
You're,
um,

1328
00:57:19,260 --> 00:57:20,093
you're tensing everything.
There's a lot of yoga that's not 

1329
00:57:21,791 --> 00:57:23,980
stretching and strengthening.
Like when you're,

1330
00:57:23,981 --> 00:57:25,240
you know,
you're standing.

1331
00:57:25,550 --> 00:57:27,730
Well,
I mean there's a bunch of stretches,

1332
00:57:27,910 --> 00:57:31,750
but it's obviously there's a bunch of 
things that do stretch your body out,

1333
00:57:31,751 --> 00:57:34,240
but there's a bunch of things that are 
just strengthening exercises.

1334
00:57:34,930 --> 00:57:37,120
You have an f,
you have a really good point.

1335
00:57:37,121 --> 00:57:37,954
And I don't.
This is just what I've been told from a 

1336
00:57:39,821 --> 00:57:42,430
doctor who,
in all honesty,

1337
00:57:42,431 --> 00:57:45,670
I don't know how well he knows ehlers 
Danlos because it's a rare disorder.

1338
00:57:46,870 --> 00:57:48,760
Doctors like to say don't do that.

1339
00:57:49,140 --> 00:57:52,270
That's a big thing,
especially with the injured.

1340
00:57:52,300 --> 00:57:53,133
Don't do that.
And it's weird because the things 

1341
00:57:54,161 --> 00:57:57,710
they've told me to do seem so much more,
uh,

1342
00:57:57,711 --> 00:57:59,980
intense.
Then Yoga,

1343
00:58:00,670 --> 00:58:01,440
it's,
I mean,

1344
00:58:01,440 --> 00:58:03,910
I've been told go ahead and bite,
go ahead and uh,

1345
00:58:03,911 --> 00:58:05,810
and a deadlift.
Go ahead and,

1346
00:58:05,811 --> 00:58:08,410
and for Fuck Sake,
they told me I can rock climb,

1347
00:58:08,560 --> 00:58:10,540
which is a thing that's one of my other,
uh,

1348
00:58:10,990 --> 00:58:12,010
exercise.
Eat things.

1349
00:58:12,011 --> 00:58:15,580
But Yoga they've said is off limits and 
it's because of yoga.

1350
00:58:15,600 --> 00:58:18,640
I mean this is the problem.
Like when people say don't do yoga,

1351
00:58:18,641 --> 00:58:19,474
I always think they think of somebody 
like bending over and touching the back 

1352
00:58:21,911 --> 00:58:22,744
of their head onto their feet.
I think the reason is because they know 

1353
00:58:24,731 --> 00:58:25,564
how flexible I started at,
so they think I'm going to pull 

1354
00:58:28,061 --> 00:58:28,894
something out more because of how like 
how much I'll push the condition that's 

1355
00:58:33,041 --> 00:58:35,680
already there and I think that's the 
concern.

1356
00:58:35,710 --> 00:58:37,750
So the problem with someone saying don't
do yoga.

1357
00:58:37,960 --> 00:58:38,793
Well Yoga encompasses a tremendous 
amount of different movements and it's 

1358
00:58:41,501 --> 00:58:42,071
very,
it's,

1359
00:58:42,071 --> 00:58:43,500
I find it really strengthening,
like,

1360
00:58:43,510 --> 00:58:45,160
and I was surprised because like I used 
to,

1361
00:58:45,550 --> 00:58:47,260
I used to be kind of that runner chick 
who was like,

1362
00:58:47,261 --> 00:58:49,240
I don't have time for yoga,
it's boring.

1363
00:58:49,241 --> 00:58:51,520
And then I started trying it of all 
people.

1364
00:58:51,521 --> 00:58:52,354
My boyfriend tried,
dragged me to a yoga class with him and 

1365
00:58:54,210 --> 00:58:56,350
I left and I'm like,
I am destroyed.

1366
00:58:56,351 --> 00:58:58,260
That was the hardest thing I've ever 
fucking done.

1367
00:58:59,040 --> 00:58:59,741
Like,
oh my God,

1368
00:58:59,741 --> 00:59:02,890
my arms were dead afterwards.
It's very hard now.

1369
00:59:02,891 --> 00:59:06,220
What made you decide to write this 
chiropractic article and what's been the

1370
00:59:06,221 --> 00:59:07,990
feedback from it?
Oh God,

1371
00:59:07,991 --> 00:59:10,200
I'm so my,
like my,

1372
00:59:10,270 --> 00:59:12,690
my editor and this is the editor that I 
worked with at,

1373
00:59:12,730 --> 00:59:15,190
at Gawker,
at cosmo and now she's,

1374
00:59:15,220 --> 00:59:15,670
you know,
at,

1375
00:59:15,670 --> 00:59:17,350
at the outline and I love writing there.

1376
00:59:17,600 --> 00:59:18,433
Uh,
and we had talked about doing one on 

1377
00:59:19,601 --> 00:59:22,970
Kairos for ages.
We got to the outline and it was like,

1378
00:59:23,180 --> 00:59:24,013
what are we,
what do we have on the table for next 

1379
00:59:24,771 --> 00:59:25,221
one?
She was like,

1380
00:59:25,221 --> 00:59:26,210
wanting to do Kairos.
I'm like,

1381
00:59:26,240 --> 00:59:27,290
fuck,
yes,

1382
00:59:27,291 --> 00:59:28,124
I do.
What was your thoughts on it before you 

1383
00:59:29,781 --> 00:59:31,880
wrote the article?
Before I wrote the article,

1384
00:59:31,881 --> 00:59:36,290
I knew that the guy who had,
I knew that a lot of Kairos did a lot of

1385
00:59:36,291 --> 00:59:37,124
crazy things.
I knew they adjusted infants that they 

1386
00:59:39,021 --> 00:59:42,500
had claimed I knew about the vertebral 
subluxation theory and that,

1387
00:59:42,501 --> 00:59:44,060
that was bullshit.
Um,

1388
00:59:44,070 --> 00:59:45,770
and I knew that a lot of them on social 
media,

1389
00:59:45,771 --> 00:59:48,440
we're crazy.
Like one of the people I reported on was

1390
00:59:48,441 --> 00:59:50,090
billy Demoss,
uh,

1391
00:59:50,091 --> 00:59:51,470
and he,
um,

1392
00:59:51,471 --> 00:59:53,360
that he thinks chem trails are real.
He's,

1393
00:59:53,570 --> 00:59:55,910
he's all,
he's a whole cluster of fucks.

1394
00:59:56,060 --> 00:59:57,320
Um,
and he,

1395
00:59:57,321 --> 00:59:58,154
um,
and so,

1396
00:59:58,850 --> 00:59:59,661
oh my God,
like,

1397
00:59:59,661 --> 01:00:01,630
it's some of the,
some of the like if you,

1398
01:00:02,250 --> 01:00:04,880
if he's a real guy,
if you're bored,

1399
01:00:05,270 --> 01:00:06,103
if you're bored,
go for like go for 10 minutes and read 

1400
01:00:07,971 --> 01:00:08,780
up on billy demoss.

1401
01:00:08,780 --> 01:00:10,560
He's fun.
Um,

1402
01:00:10,580 --> 01:00:11,680
and it's just,
he's.

1403
01:00:12,130 --> 01:00:14,300
And it's funny because I was not,
I'll get into that in a minute,

1404
01:00:14,301 --> 01:00:15,440
but like we,
um,

1405
01:00:15,710 --> 01:00:19,970
I learned a lot doing this because I 
didn't realize that a DD Palmer,

1406
01:00:19,971 --> 01:00:21,890
the guy who invented it,
he,

1407
01:00:22,050 --> 01:00:26,630
he got most of his information from 
doing seances with a dead doctor.

1408
01:00:26,840 --> 01:00:28,490
That blew my mind.
I'm like,

1409
01:00:28,491 --> 01:00:29,420
I had to.
I'm like,

1410
01:00:29,421 --> 01:00:31,760
I know it's late and I'm a little high 
right now,

1411
01:00:31,761 --> 01:00:33,800
but I had to have hallucinated that 
like,

1412
01:00:34,130 --> 01:00:35,240
you know,
read it again the next morning.

1413
01:00:35,241 --> 01:00:36,080
I'm like,
nope,

1414
01:00:36,260 --> 01:00:38,420
that's for real.
Like it was.

1415
01:00:38,870 --> 01:00:43,870
And nobody in chiropractic questions 
this when they go to Dr. we were telling

1416
01:00:44,241 --> 01:00:46,220
me this before the show and I stopped 
you and said,

1417
01:00:46,221 --> 01:00:47,054
let's talk about this during the show 
when you said you've talked to 

1418
01:00:48,711 --> 01:00:49,544
chiropractors that we're in the middle 
of chiropractic school and they read 

1419
01:00:53,481 --> 01:00:55,400
about this stuff and they were like,
what in the fuck?

1420
01:00:55,580 --> 01:00:56,413
It's sort of like that Gypsy going clear
that scientology documentary that was a 

1421
01:00:59,271 --> 01:01:00,104
good one,
but like scientology scientology with a 

1422
01:01:04,821 --> 01:01:06,590
given the written notes by l Ron 
Hubbard.

1423
01:01:06,591 --> 01:01:07,424
And he's like,
what in the fuck is this and your 

1424
01:01:08,600 --> 01:01:09,433
$300,000 in and you can't leave.
So I got two emails from chiropractors 

1425
01:01:13,430 --> 01:01:14,930
and I,
it's like I couldn't,

1426
01:01:14,931 --> 01:01:16,670
you know,
put their names out publicly.

1427
01:01:17,100 --> 01:01:20,060
But I got two emails from chiropractors 
and I checked in and I'm like,

1428
01:01:20,061 --> 01:01:22,550
these are indeed chiropractors.
I went to their websites.

1429
01:01:22,551 --> 01:01:23,384
They were absolutely on the level that 
said they went to chiropractic school 

1430
01:01:27,231 --> 01:01:29,300
and part way through they realized it 
was all shit.

1431
01:01:29,780 --> 01:01:30,613
One of them even said they wouldn't 
refer people to a chiropractor like it 

1432
01:01:33,561 --> 01:01:35,450
was nutty.
And one of the guys,

1433
01:01:35,640 --> 01:01:36,473
um,
he sent me to a forum for like in which 

1434
01:01:39,981 --> 01:01:42,740
chiropractor's bitch about the field of 
chiropractic.

1435
01:01:43,440 --> 01:01:45,590
It's there.
And they were like,

1436
01:01:45,620 --> 01:01:46,453
which part of this is bullshit?
You guys believe in the vertebral 

1437
01:01:48,141 --> 01:01:49,370
subluxation theory.
And they're like,

1438
01:01:49,371 --> 01:01:51,230
no,
subluxations don't exist.

1439
01:01:51,231 --> 01:01:51,921
Like,
you know,

1440
01:01:51,921 --> 01:01:53,670
if you want to do this ethically just 
cry,

1441
01:01:53,720 --> 01:01:55,610
you know,
take people in who have injuries,

1442
01:01:55,611 --> 01:01:56,444
try to do some physical therapy,
get them stronger and get them out and 

1443
01:01:58,701 --> 01:01:59,534
as few sessions as you can.
So they're essentially unlicensed 

1444
01:02:01,791 --> 01:02:03,140
physical therapy.
And like,

1445
01:02:03,220 --> 01:02:04,053
it's funny because I'll occasionally 
pass by a chiropractic clinic where I 

1446
01:02:06,201 --> 01:02:08,810
see them saying back injuries work 
injuries,

1447
01:02:09,010 --> 01:02:09,831
um,
you know,

1448
01:02:09,831 --> 01:02:11,360
sports,
physical therapy.

1449
01:02:11,361 --> 01:02:12,111
And I'm like,
okay,

1450
01:02:12,111 --> 01:02:15,620
if I ever wanted to go to a chiropractor
because I lost my mind and couldn't find

1451
01:02:15,621 --> 01:02:17,990
a physical therapist,
that's the type I would go to.

1452
01:02:18,260 --> 01:02:19,093
But you know,
if you see them advertising magic 

1453
01:02:20,491 --> 01:02:22,650
crystals and aura healing,
fucking run,

1454
01:02:22,980 --> 01:02:25,390
run.
Like this is the,

1455
01:02:25,560 --> 01:02:26,940
there are a few of them out there.

1456
01:02:26,940 --> 01:02:30,420
And I looked at one of the guys' 
websites who emailed me and there was an

1457
01:02:30,421 --> 01:02:31,260
Faq.
It's like,

1458
01:02:31,261 --> 01:02:33,210
do you have to keep coming back forever?
No,

1459
01:02:33,211 --> 01:02:35,490
we try to get you out in as few sessions
as possible.

1460
01:02:35,491 --> 01:02:36,360
I'm like,
oh,

1461
01:02:36,420 --> 01:02:38,040
I have hope.
But like,

1462
01:02:38,070 --> 01:02:39,730
there's,
there's a woman who is,

1463
01:02:40,190 --> 01:02:41,023
the of it is bullshit.
It's like even if you're trying to get 

1464
01:02:44,251 --> 01:02:46,600
me out as few sessions as possible,
you're still like.

1465
01:02:46,620 --> 01:02:48,150
But there was a.
it's funny,

1466
01:02:48,151 --> 01:02:50,790
there's a woman,
her name is Britt Marie Hermes.

1467
01:02:51,030 --> 01:02:52,040
She was,
uh,

1468
01:02:52,050 --> 01:02:54,330
she went to school to be a natural path 
and she graduated,

1469
01:02:54,331 --> 01:02:59,160
became a naturopath and she realized 
after a short period of time that it was

1470
01:02:59,161 --> 01:03:01,410
all bullshit like naturopathic doctor 
and she's like,

1471
01:03:01,411 --> 01:03:04,500
we can't actually treat people.
We have to send people to real doctors.

1472
01:03:04,530 --> 01:03:08,970
The advice we're giving is all based on 
misdirection and complete shit.

1473
01:03:08,970 --> 01:03:09,803
And I,
I'm so in awe of the fact that she went 

1474
01:03:15,091 --> 01:03:16,230
through this.
She like,

1475
01:03:16,231 --> 01:03:19,290
and these people,
one of the things they said was,

1476
01:03:19,380 --> 01:03:20,730
you know,
I was in all this debt.

1477
01:03:20,731 --> 01:03:21,780
I figured,
you know,

1478
01:03:21,790 --> 01:03:22,830
I'm like,
Paul Haggis,

1479
01:03:22,831 --> 01:03:24,030
you know,
I'm already here.

1480
01:03:24,031 --> 01:03:26,340
May as well keep going.
Britt said,

1481
01:03:26,370 --> 01:03:27,330
you know,
it doesn't matter.

1482
01:03:27,331 --> 01:03:29,700
I realized I was in a profession based 
on bullshit.

1483
01:03:29,701 --> 01:03:30,534
I had to leave.
He did have some people that you talked 

1484
01:03:32,761 --> 01:03:33,594
to that were chiropractors that we're in
the middle of it and they realized it 

1485
01:03:35,371 --> 01:03:38,790
was bullshit and they to stay and they 
stayed because what the fuck do I do?

1486
01:03:38,850 --> 01:03:41,250
I have to get my money back for my 
student loans and I'm like,

1487
01:03:41,251 --> 01:03:42,750
you know what,
you could have gone like,

1488
01:03:42,751 --> 01:03:44,520
you weren't.
You can get like,

1489
01:03:44,610 --> 01:03:46,860
I mean,
I say this as someone who got into a lot

1490
01:03:46,861 --> 01:03:49,890
of debt for my real degree,
go and get another degree.

1491
01:03:49,890 --> 01:03:50,723
If you're smart enough to have gotten at
least your undergrad before you went to 

1492
01:03:54,090 --> 01:03:54,923
Palmer chiropractic.
Have an undergrad before you go to 

1493
01:03:57,121 --> 01:03:58,060
Palmer?
Chiropractor?

1494
01:03:58,061 --> 01:04:00,330
I believe so,
given that it's a doctorate program now,

1495
01:04:00,331 --> 01:04:02,400
one of the guys that I went to Undergrad
with,

1496
01:04:02,401 --> 01:04:03,120
no,
he was,

1497
01:04:03,120 --> 01:04:05,370
he was smart.
He had a biology degree and he was there

1498
01:04:05,371 --> 01:04:06,204
on scholarship.
He was one of the smarter kids in the 

1499
01:04:08,071 --> 01:04:09,680
buyer program.
Like there was,

1500
01:04:09,770 --> 01:04:10,603
there was,
he could have gotten a doctorate if he 

1501
01:04:13,351 --> 01:04:15,210
wanted.
He went to Palmer.

1502
01:04:15,420 --> 01:04:16,080
Um,
you know,

1503
01:04:16,080 --> 01:04:17,770
same school as some of the,
uh,

1504
01:04:18,060 --> 01:04:22,170
Kairos in this article and it was funny,
like one of my editor that I worked with

1505
01:04:22,171 --> 01:04:25,020
on this piece asked me,
so the doctors that you're concentrating

1506
01:04:25,021 --> 01:04:28,140
on in this piece,
are they the exception to the norm?

1507
01:04:28,141 --> 01:04:30,480
As is how regular chiropractors work.
I'm like,

1508
01:04:30,481 --> 01:04:34,230
let me go look at my friend from 
college's a little chiropractic page.

1509
01:04:34,230 --> 01:04:36,360
And I looked,
he adjusts infants.

1510
01:04:36,361 --> 01:04:40,230
He claims that he can stop bed wedding 
from adjusting a seven year old.

1511
01:04:40,231 --> 01:04:41,550
I'm like,
oh my God.

1512
01:04:41,580 --> 01:04:42,480
I'm like,
this is.

1513
01:04:42,750 --> 01:04:44,160
And like I,
I'm sitting here going,

1514
01:04:44,161 --> 01:04:44,994
my God like this,
this guy that I went to school with who 

1515
01:04:47,191 --> 01:04:48,430
seemed,
you know,

1516
01:04:48,480 --> 01:04:49,980
he was smart.
He was like,

1517
01:04:49,981 --> 01:04:51,210
this is,
I was,

1518
01:04:51,211 --> 01:04:52,610
I was kind of like.
And I wasn't,

1519
01:04:52,650 --> 01:04:53,483
it was hard to be mad.
I was just disappointed in this person 

1520
01:04:55,771 --> 01:04:57,900
that I just stuck in this system.
I mean,

1521
01:04:57,901 --> 01:04:58,734
is that like a bunch of people that are 
also doing the same thing and they just 

1522
01:05:01,411 --> 01:05:02,244
kind of get caught up in this idea?
I think they hear it from a bunch of 

1523
01:05:05,161 --> 01:05:08,940
people who they think are experts like 
their teachers and they're going,

1524
01:05:08,941 --> 01:05:09,774
no,
this is accepted so we're going to take 

1525
01:05:10,651 --> 01:05:10,981
it.
It's like,

1526
01:05:10,981 --> 01:05:11,814
you know what if you like,
if I saw people in science like because 

1527
01:05:14,730 --> 01:05:15,960
I,
I promote a lot of things,

1528
01:05:15,970 --> 01:05:17,100
you know,
we might disagree on,

1529
01:05:17,110 --> 01:05:19,150
but you know,
I promote a lot of ideas in science that

1530
01:05:19,151 --> 01:05:22,710
I've seen the evidence for and I've seen
a lot of it and we disagreed.

1531
01:05:22,930 --> 01:05:25,490
I'm seeing some dietary things I would 
guess like,

1532
01:05:25,680 --> 01:05:26,620
cause you know,
we can,

1533
01:05:26,650 --> 01:05:28,660
we can hash that,
like what are,

1534
01:05:28,750 --> 01:05:30,460
I don't know,
what are your thoughts on Gmos?

1535
01:05:31,450 --> 01:05:32,283
Genetically Modified Foods is apparently
almost everything that you buy at the 

1536
01:05:35,561 --> 01:05:36,330
supermarket.
Okay.

1537
01:05:36,330 --> 01:05:38,110
What did we agree on that then?
Probably,

1538
01:05:38,111 --> 01:05:40,690
and it's like I think they know you by 
every orange.

1539
01:05:40,720 --> 01:05:43,510
If you look at a piece of corn,
oh it's organic.

1540
01:05:43,511 --> 01:05:46,750
That Shit is genetically modified.
It's been modified for 100 years.

1541
01:05:46,900 --> 01:05:48,160
They're going to make me cry.
Tears.

1542
01:05:48,910 --> 01:05:49,750
I've,
I've talked.

1543
01:05:49,790 --> 01:05:53,710
You had Kevin Folta was.
I was so happy I had him on because he's

1544
01:05:53,711 --> 01:05:57,130
never in California.
We went out for dinner that night,

1545
01:05:57,160 --> 01:05:57,993
so it takes a lot of shit because 
Monsanto is funded some of the studies 

1546
01:06:01,361 --> 01:06:03,610
that they've done,
but the studies are real and the studies

1547
01:06:03,611 --> 01:06:04,350
of.
I mean,

1548
01:06:04,350 --> 01:06:06,070
you can see the results.

1549
01:06:06,190 --> 01:06:07,780
They're not manipulated.
Yeah.

1550
01:06:07,781 --> 01:06:08,614
Kevin,
it's.

1551
01:06:08,800 --> 01:06:11,440
Well actually no,
they funded his communication program so

1552
01:06:11,441 --> 01:06:12,274
that he can come out and do things like 
this and they never funded any of his 

1553
01:06:16,061 --> 01:06:17,000
research.
That's right.

1554
01:06:17,060 --> 01:06:18,550
You're right.
I misspoke.

1555
01:06:18,770 --> 01:06:19,060
No,
no,

1556
01:06:19,060 --> 01:06:19,731
it's fine.
It's a.

1557
01:06:19,731 --> 01:06:20,950
But you know what,
here's a.

1558
01:06:21,040 --> 01:06:23,950
and this is what,
where he got a lot of shit was um,

1559
01:06:23,980 --> 01:06:26,830
was that he said I have nothing to do 
with Monsanto.

1560
01:06:27,090 --> 01:06:29,410
Um,
and like I think if he just said,

1561
01:06:29,411 --> 01:06:30,244
you know,
what they fund my communication program 

1562
01:06:31,451 --> 01:06:33,670
but they don't have anything to do with 
my research.

1563
01:06:33,880 --> 01:06:34,713
Nobody would have A.
I think people still would have been 

1564
01:06:36,251 --> 01:06:37,084
mad,
but I think people would have been far 

1565
01:06:37,691 --> 01:06:38,524
less mad and I feel so bad that he went 
through everything with that because 

1566
01:06:41,681 --> 01:06:44,350
there was anything with Monsanto.
It's tricky.

1567
01:06:44,690 --> 01:06:45,523
I mean,
I just took a tour there and I got hate 

1568
01:06:46,721 --> 01:06:48,190
mail like,
and it's,

1569
01:06:48,370 --> 01:06:51,370
I mean we were so careful because I was 
out there for other business,

1570
01:06:51,420 --> 01:06:52,180
um,
and they were like,

1571
01:06:52,180 --> 01:06:53,013
oh,
you're going to be out in,

1572
01:06:53,060 --> 01:06:54,880
in Missouri,
come have a tour.

1573
01:06:54,880 --> 01:06:59,170
Like they didn't pay to the star and I 
had so much fun like it was,

1574
01:06:59,200 --> 01:07:00,033
there was,
they have a lot of really cool tech 

1575
01:07:00,791 --> 01:07:04,300
there and if you're ever in the area 
they'd gladly show you around.

1576
01:07:04,600 --> 01:07:06,880
So they're there.
They were nice to me and responding.

1577
01:07:06,910 --> 01:07:07,743
One of the,
one of the rumors that I heard about 

1578
01:07:09,311 --> 01:07:11,710
that was that they only have organic 
food in the cafeteria.

1579
01:07:11,711 --> 01:07:12,544
I'm like,
I'm taking,

1580
01:07:12,760 --> 01:07:15,880
I'm taking my camera around and taking 
pictures of everything.

1581
01:07:15,910 --> 01:07:18,020
The word organic is such a weird way 
too.

1582
01:07:18,060 --> 01:07:20,560
It's like what's organic and what's not 
now it's like,

1583
01:07:20,650 --> 01:07:21,483
it's very clear definition.
Organic uses pesticides and that's 

1584
01:07:24,881 --> 01:07:26,720
something I think people see.
Yeah,

1585
01:07:26,950 --> 01:07:30,730
absolutely.
I mean I was the whole point of organic.

1586
01:07:31,050 --> 01:07:31,883
You don't use pesticides or you know,
I'm sure there are some organic farmers 

1587
01:07:34,511 --> 01:07:39,370
that don't use any google this.
What defines organic food?

1588
01:07:40,090 --> 01:07:42,580
Let's find out what is the accepted 
definition,

1589
01:07:42,760 --> 01:07:44,530
organic food.
Do you want to hear it from me?

1590
01:07:44,531 --> 01:07:46,960
And then from Google to see if I'm at 
all right,

1591
01:07:46,961 --> 01:07:51,700
so organic food works by certain farming
stand or agricultural standards and they

1592
01:07:51,701 --> 01:07:52,534
can use certain pesticides.
In most cases these pesticides are 

1593
01:07:56,501 --> 01:07:59,530
derived from natural sources.
I'm not always,

1594
01:07:59,531 --> 01:08:00,364
but most of the time and some of these 
pesticides include pesticides like 

1595
01:08:02,831 --> 01:08:05,370
wrote,
known and the [inaudible] and also have,

1596
01:08:05,410 --> 01:08:07,760
if you're familiar with bt corn,
um,

1597
01:08:08,160 --> 01:08:08,993
the bt toxin is also used in organic 
farming for because it's a naturally 

1598
01:08:13,391 --> 01:08:15,250
occurring,
a toxin,

1599
01:08:15,470 --> 01:08:19,700
it can be used and sprayed topically on 
organic produce.

1600
01:08:19,940 --> 01:08:20,773
So a lot of these are the things that we
think of as just conventional farming 

1601
01:08:24,081 --> 01:08:26,600
practices.
Definitely use in organic farming.

1602
01:08:26,750 --> 01:08:29,720
It doesn't make it any better or worse.
It just,

1603
01:08:29,721 --> 01:08:30,554
in a lot of cases it's a little more 
expensive partially because of the 

1604
01:08:32,451 --> 01:08:35,930
certification process and partially 
because it uses older farming techniques

1605
01:08:35,931 --> 01:08:38,420
that need a little more land,
that type of stuff.

1606
01:08:38,421 --> 01:08:41,470
It also uses a till farming practices 
that you know,

1607
01:08:41,480 --> 01:08:44,240
digs up the ground a bit more and 
Kimberly's a little more co two,

1608
01:08:44,241 --> 01:08:46,910
so in general I tend to.
Oh,

1609
01:08:46,940 --> 01:08:47,430
here we go.

1610
01:08:47,430 --> 01:08:48,900
Here we go.
Simply stated,

1611
01:08:48,901 --> 01:08:52,740
organic produce or other ingredients are
grown without the use of pesticides.

1612
01:08:52,950 --> 01:08:54,390
Synthetic fertilizers,
excuse me,

1613
01:08:54,391 --> 01:08:56,040
hold on.
Sewage sludge,

1614
01:08:56,041 --> 01:08:59,880
genetically modified organisms or 
ionizing radiation.

1615
01:08:59,881 --> 01:09:01,710
Animals that produce meat,
poultry,

1616
01:09:01,770 --> 01:09:02,940
eggs,
and dairy products.

1617
01:09:02,941 --> 01:09:06,390
Do not take antibiotics or growth 
hormones to us.

1618
01:09:06,720 --> 01:09:07,553
Hold on,
sorry.

1619
01:09:07,590 --> 01:09:08,181
The U.
S,

1620
01:09:08,181 --> 01:09:09,014
d,
a national organic program defines 

1621
01:09:11,221 --> 01:09:12,054
organic as follows.
Organic food is produced by farmers who 

1622
01:09:15,151 --> 01:09:15,984
emphasize the use of renewable resources
and the conservation of soil and water 

1623
01:09:19,471 --> 01:09:22,110
to enhance environmental quality for 
future generations.

1624
01:09:22,470 --> 01:09:23,303
Organic meat,
poultry and eggs and dairy products are 

1625
01:09:24,751 --> 01:09:27,510
made from animals that are given no 
antibiotics or growth hormones.

1626
01:09:27,660 --> 01:09:32,010
Organic food is produced without using 
most conventional pesticides.

1627
01:09:32,011 --> 01:09:32,844
There we go.
Fertilizer is made with synthetic 

1628
01:09:34,651 --> 01:09:35,484
ingredients or sewage sludge 
bioengineering or ionizing radiation 

1629
01:09:39,150 --> 01:09:39,983
before a product can be labeled organic 
and quotes a government approved 

1630
01:09:43,350 --> 01:09:44,183
certifier inspects the farm where the 
food is grown to make sure the farmers 

1631
01:09:47,190 --> 01:09:50,480
following all the rules necessary to 
meet USD.

1632
01:09:50,670 --> 01:09:51,870
Organic standards,

1633
01:09:52,610 --> 01:09:53,443
no.
The one thing on there that will 

1634
01:09:53,951 --> 01:09:56,470
disagree with what their first paragraph
as they say,

1635
01:09:56,471 --> 01:09:57,304
without the use of pesticides.
In the second paragraph it says organic 

1636
01:10:00,311 --> 01:10:03,610
food is produced without using most 
conventional pesticides.

1637
01:10:03,611 --> 01:10:06,190
You see that slight little slight of 
hand

1638
01:10:06,200 --> 01:10:09,590
because one of them is theirs and the 
other one is USD.

1639
01:10:09,591 --> 01:10:11,190
A little slider.

1640
01:10:12,820 --> 01:10:14,580
I mean if you.
If,

1641
01:10:14,660 --> 01:10:16,150
if I may ask,
would you.

1642
01:10:16,180 --> 01:10:16,720
Would you like to do.

1643
01:10:16,720 --> 01:10:21,400
Google will hold on a second.
Let's Google what pesticides can be used

1644
01:10:21,490 --> 01:10:22,323
and still make it organic.
Exactly what I was going to request a 

1645
01:10:26,261 --> 01:10:28,510
organic pesticides approved for use in 
the u.

1646
01:10:28,910 --> 01:10:33,910
s we go now what?
What are the fears of pesticides?

1647
01:10:35,171 --> 01:10:37,570
Right.
People worried about toxins getting into

1648
01:10:37,571 --> 01:10:41,370
their food,
getting in their body and cancer.

1649
01:10:41,750 --> 01:10:42,000
I

1650
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:45,360
understand that fear partially because I
went through it quite a bit,

1651
01:10:45,361 --> 01:10:46,194
like when I got sick a few years ago,
like my first symptom wasn't celiac 

1652
01:10:49,321 --> 01:10:51,390
disease.
It wasn't my joints popping out.

1653
01:10:51,570 --> 01:10:53,340
I got the worst headache of my life one 
day at it.

1654
01:10:53,341 --> 01:10:54,174
Never went away like that.
That'll make you scared to death of 

1655
01:10:56,970 --> 01:10:59,640
everything around you.
Like I went organic,

1656
01:10:59,641 --> 01:11:01,710
I went Vegan,
I went.

1657
01:11:01,790 --> 01:11:04,560
I'd cut everything out of my diet 
because I was scared that,

1658
01:11:04,590 --> 01:11:05,550
you know,
you get,

1659
01:11:05,820 --> 01:11:08,490
you feel like you're getting stabbed in 
the eye constantly.

1660
01:11:08,491 --> 01:11:10,140
You're going to cut everything out of 
your diet.

1661
01:11:10,380 --> 01:11:13,000
This happened all at once.
One day worse had it.

1662
01:11:13,110 --> 01:11:16,710
I was working and at the time I wasn't 
working in the pesticide lab yet.

1663
01:11:16,711 --> 01:11:20,850
I was working in a drug analysis lab.
I'm worried that that was what was going

1664
01:11:20,851 --> 01:11:24,150
on that absorbs that or something.
Well,

1665
01:11:24,151 --> 01:11:24,480
it was.

1666
01:11:24,480 --> 01:11:26,640
I was the thing that I was worried 
because I was.

1667
01:11:26,670 --> 01:11:28,170
At the time I was,
I was.

1668
01:11:28,390 --> 01:11:31,350
There was much more than the hits a day 
I was.

1669
01:11:31,500 --> 01:11:33,450
It was much more of me and there is here
today.

1670
01:11:33,451 --> 01:11:34,680
I was,
I'm five,

1671
01:11:34,681 --> 01:11:37,350
nine and I at the time weighed almost 
250 pounds.

1672
01:11:37,351 --> 01:11:39,060
I,
I needed to lose a little of me,

1673
01:11:39,061 --> 01:11:39,900
but it was like,
all right,

1674
01:11:39,901 --> 01:11:43,230
I'm eating shitty food.
I should probably try eating healthier.

1675
01:11:43,231 --> 01:11:45,240
But I mean,
nevermind just more salads.

1676
01:11:45,241 --> 01:11:46,470
I'm like,
I went organic.

1677
01:11:46,471 --> 01:11:48,450
I went,
I just cut everything out of my diet.

1678
01:11:48,560 --> 01:11:50,630
So there was a bunch of issues.
It was,

1679
01:11:50,840 --> 01:11:53,150
it wasn't terry as well.
I mean,

1680
01:11:53,151 --> 01:11:55,060
yeah,
like I cut a lot of things out,

1681
01:11:55,110 --> 01:11:57,030
started working out everything,
but you know,

1682
01:11:57,031 --> 01:11:57,864
what,
I still needed medication because it 

1683
01:11:58,831 --> 01:12:01,350
turned out there was just um,
a uh,

1684
01:12:01,380 --> 01:12:02,213
it was just,
I had and we figured out the headache 

1685
01:12:03,811 --> 01:12:07,300
was linked into the ehlers Danlos 
Syndrome and there are some to,

1686
01:12:07,380 --> 01:12:08,220
to clarify everything.

1687
01:12:08,220 --> 01:12:09,670
Some people,
when they have one autoimmune,

1688
01:12:09,780 --> 01:12:11,820
they can tend to cluster.
So there's,

1689
01:12:11,821 --> 01:12:12,654
that's,
I,

1690
01:12:12,740 --> 01:12:14,700
I,
I was lucky color 1 million.

1691
01:12:14,701 --> 01:12:15,980
Um,
but that was,

1692
01:12:16,010 --> 01:12:17,730
that was the thing with it.
But I tried,

1693
01:12:17,731 --> 01:12:19,980
you know,
I looked into this and I fell for all of

1694
01:12:19,981 --> 01:12:20,611
it.
Like so,

1695
01:12:20,611 --> 01:12:24,420
all of the pesticides are killing you.
It's the toxin.

1696
01:12:24,421 --> 01:12:25,254
So I mean,
I understand the fear of the people who 

1697
01:12:27,031 --> 01:12:29,310
were like,
I need to cut toxins out of my diet.

1698
01:12:29,530 --> 01:12:33,200
Do.
Is there any foundation in truth?

1699
01:12:33,210 --> 01:12:36,180
I mean,
nothing bad for you?

1700
01:12:36,210 --> 01:12:36,990
Well,
no pesticide.

1701
01:12:36,990 --> 01:12:37,823
Here's the thing,
there is a little bit of truth that 

1702
01:12:39,841 --> 01:12:42,690
sells.
The lie is what I will give this because

1703
01:12:42,960 --> 01:12:43,501
I,
you know,

1704
01:12:43,501 --> 01:12:44,334
I used to work with bulk quantities of 
pesticides at my last lab and that was 

1705
01:12:47,191 --> 01:12:48,024
kind of what sealed the deal for me that
these when they're in your food are not 

1706
01:12:51,150 --> 01:12:51,983
going to hurt you because the amount of 
testing we had to go through and the 

1707
01:12:55,321 --> 01:12:56,154
amount of regulation,
I think regulation in this case is a 

1708
01:12:57,631 --> 01:13:00,180
good thing because it will stop a bad 
pesticide,

1709
01:13:00,350 --> 01:13:01,830
uh,
for making it to market.

1710
01:13:01,830 --> 01:13:05,460
And I want that regulation there because
I eat the food too.

1711
01:13:05,500 --> 01:13:09,620
I don't want anyone's child to ever get 
hurt from something that,

1712
01:13:09,650 --> 01:13:11,970
that me or another,
like I don't work there anymore.

1713
01:13:11,971 --> 01:13:12,804
But you know that,
that I had any work and getting on the 

1714
01:13:15,331 --> 01:13:17,160
market,
I don't want to ever want that to be the

1715
01:13:17,161 --> 01:13:17,994
case,
but once upon a time the pesticides we 

1716
01:13:19,951 --> 01:13:20,784
had on the market were much less 
targeted to hurting the weeds and could 

1717
01:13:23,971 --> 01:13:24,804
hurt people too,
like arson are cynical's a sulfuric 

1718
01:13:27,391 --> 01:13:29,010
acid.
Those were early pesticides,

1719
01:13:29,011 --> 01:13:29,731
Paris,
green,

1720
01:13:29,731 --> 01:13:31,400
totally toxic,
especially to,

1721
01:13:31,720 --> 01:13:33,240
uh,
to the farmers and to the,

1722
01:13:33,270 --> 01:13:37,350
even to the farm equipment,
the stuff we have now far less toxic and

1723
01:13:37,351 --> 01:13:40,120
I mean people used far less though 
toxic.

1724
01:13:40,180 --> 01:13:41,013
It's in me.
I'm going to qualify this answer and I 

1725
01:13:43,321 --> 01:13:44,154
mean I'm not,
I'm not qualifying it to back off from 

1726
01:13:45,391 --> 01:13:46,224
it,
but everything is toxic in some dosage 

1727
01:13:48,300 --> 01:13:50,330
so water will kill you.

1728
01:13:50,400 --> 01:13:52,800
But I mean,
so roundup is one that people are really

1729
01:13:52,801 --> 01:13:53,634
scared of it.
It's one that a lot of people know 

1730
01:13:54,331 --> 01:13:57,850
about.
There is a great graph on,

1731
01:13:57,980 --> 01:14:00,720
on the showing how less toxic it is than
the,

1732
01:14:00,840 --> 01:14:02,670
than the pesticides that replaced 
because we weren't,

1733
01:14:02,700 --> 01:14:05,460
we didn't go from using no pesticide to 
using roundup.

1734
01:14:05,720 --> 01:14:06,553
Um,
and I know someone's gonna correct me 

1735
01:14:07,141 --> 01:14:08,450
saying it's an herbicide,
but um,

1736
01:14:08,520 --> 01:14:11,130
herbicide is pesticides the blanket 
term,

1737
01:14:11,290 --> 01:14:13,780
all things that killed a stuff and 
farming.

1738
01:14:14,010 --> 01:14:15,820
Um,
so before,

1739
01:14:15,850 --> 01:14:18,450
um,
before roundup,

1740
01:14:18,460 --> 01:14:21,490
I believe the one we used with Cyanna 
azine I could be wrong on this,

1741
01:14:22,060 --> 01:14:25,570
but the one we used before roundup was 
in terms of the ld 50,

1742
01:14:25,571 --> 01:14:28,180
the lethal dose for about 50 percent of 
the population.

1743
01:14:28,420 --> 01:14:33,400
It was 10 times higher than roundup and 
now we barely sell any of it.

1744
01:14:33,670 --> 01:14:34,503
So we just,
the issue just lethal dose or toxic 

1745
01:14:38,290 --> 01:14:41,020
toxicity that affects your body cancer.

1746
01:14:41,300 --> 01:14:41,820
It's,
I,

1747
01:14:41,820 --> 01:14:42,653
and I understand that's a question that 
people keep coming back to and part of 

1748
01:14:46,151 --> 01:14:46,984
the reason that people are suspicious of
it is because of its use with the GMO 

1749
01:14:50,110 --> 01:14:50,943
and the,
these things go through hundreds of 

1750
01:14:52,991 --> 01:14:53,824
tests and years of testing.
And because of the suspicion with 

1751
01:14:55,661 --> 01:14:58,190
roundup,
it's gone through continual testing,

1752
01:14:58,191 --> 01:15:00,010
like they've tested to see if it,
uh,

1753
01:15:00,011 --> 01:15:02,110
if it accumulates in breast milk,
it does not.

1754
01:15:02,370 --> 01:15:03,203
Um,
they've tested to see if it causes 

1755
01:15:04,421 --> 01:15:06,100
cancer,
doesn't seem to.

1756
01:15:06,280 --> 01:15:07,270
Um,
and they've tried,

1757
01:15:07,271 --> 01:15:11,050
they've used it at higher doses of mice 
and rats.

1758
01:15:11,080 --> 01:15:11,820
They've,
they've,

1759
01:15:11,820 --> 01:15:12,910
uh,
they've tested in humans.

1760
01:15:12,980 --> 01:15:17,980
It's been on the market for 30 years,
mean like it's been in the population or

1761
01:15:19,421 --> 01:15:20,254
it's been used now for I believe,
25 years and there doesn't seem to be 

1762
01:15:23,921 --> 01:15:24,754
the only,
the only apparent increase in cancer is 

1763
01:15:27,071 --> 01:15:28,450
because we're living longer now.

1764
01:15:28,450 --> 01:15:30,550
And when you have any population that 
lives longer,

1765
01:15:30,551 --> 01:15:34,060
you have increased incidence of cancer.
Like we're not dying from polio anymore.

1766
01:15:34,061 --> 01:15:34,894
So we're dying from something like 
unfortunately we're not gonna live 

1767
01:15:37,361 --> 01:15:38,520
forever.
So.

1768
01:15:38,700 --> 01:15:39,380
Yeah.
But,

1769
01:15:39,380 --> 01:15:40,213
so,
um,

1770
01:15:40,360 --> 01:15:41,193
there's a toxicity issue when it comes 
to roundup or when it comes to any sort 

1771
01:15:47,891 --> 01:15:50,110
of pesticide.
When you're talking about herbicides,

1772
01:15:50,111 --> 01:15:52,180
herbicides are what kills the plants,
right?

1773
01:15:52,181 --> 01:15:55,330
Kills Weeds,
kills bugs that are pests.

1774
01:15:55,510 --> 01:15:57,280
Pesticides are,
it's the blanket term.

1775
01:15:57,281 --> 01:15:59,890
Insecticide kills bugs.
So pesticides,

1776
01:15:59,920 --> 01:16:01,600
the,
the whole blanket term.

1777
01:16:01,601 --> 01:16:02,434
Yep.
Okay.

1778
01:16:02,560 --> 01:16:03,393
So what is,
what's the most controversial is that 

1779
01:16:05,801 --> 01:16:08,410
roundup.
Roundup is controversial and I think the

1780
01:16:08,411 --> 01:16:11,260
reason that it became controversial is 
because people heard,

1781
01:16:11,450 --> 01:16:12,283
all right,
you have to genetically modify the 

1782
01:16:13,301 --> 01:16:17,230
plants so that the roundup doesn't kill 
the plant and it's this whole thing just

1783
01:16:17,231 --> 01:16:20,290
to make money for Monsanto and how dare 
you make money.

1784
01:16:20,530 --> 01:16:21,490
Um,
and that's,

1785
01:16:21,491 --> 01:16:25,960
I think that was why people got mad was 
because of the genetic modification.

1786
01:16:25,961 --> 01:16:27,680
Lincoln with roundup.
Um,

1787
01:16:27,681 --> 01:16:28,271
and it's,
you know,

1788
01:16:28,271 --> 01:16:30,590
it's a new technology or it's one of 
the,

1789
01:16:30,600 --> 01:16:31,433
it's a newer technology and it kind of 
made people a little aware of farming 

1790
01:16:35,621 --> 01:16:36,454
for the first time and net.
Like I go to farming conferences a lot 

1791
01:16:38,861 --> 01:16:39,694
of times to talk about how to 
communicate agriculture and I'll sit 

1792
01:16:42,431 --> 01:16:44,320
down and ask farmers,
you know,

1793
01:16:44,321 --> 01:16:46,540
what are you plant,
why are you planting it,

1794
01:16:46,541 --> 01:16:50,740
what do you think of Gmos you use 
roundup and do you buy from people other

1795
01:16:50,741 --> 01:16:51,574
than do you buy for Monsanto?
And do you buy from people other than 

1796
01:16:53,681 --> 01:16:54,514
Monsanto?
And that handful of questions will tell 

1797
01:16:57,191 --> 01:16:57,850
me.
Well,

1798
01:16:57,850 --> 01:16:58,361
I mean,
if I,

1799
01:16:58,361 --> 01:17:00,660
I wish I had more videos of this,
but like there's,

1800
01:17:00,710 --> 01:17:01,543
there's a video at some point on my site
with two farmers who buy from Monsanto 

1801
01:17:05,501 --> 01:17:09,680
and buy from other companies and one of 
the reasons I asked is because there's a

1802
01:17:09,681 --> 01:17:11,570
rumor on the Internet that if you buy 
from Monsanto,

1803
01:17:11,571 --> 01:17:13,670
you can only buy for Monsanto.

1804
01:17:14,180 --> 01:17:16,370
Just not true,
uh,

1805
01:17:16,371 --> 01:17:17,030
that,
you know,

1806
01:17:17,030 --> 01:17:19,580
every genetically modified crop is,
uh,

1807
01:17:19,581 --> 01:17:20,390
is,
is,

1808
01:17:20,390 --> 01:17:22,490
you know,
just is made to be roundup ready.

1809
01:17:22,700 --> 01:17:24,080
Again,
not true,

1810
01:17:24,260 --> 01:17:25,100
uh,
that you know,

1811
01:17:25,120 --> 01:17:26,180
that people are,
you know,

1812
01:17:26,440 --> 01:17:28,120
are being,
um,

1813
01:17:28,700 --> 01:17:31,850
that people are dying of cancer from 
just being around roundup.

1814
01:17:31,851 --> 01:17:36,470
And recently they found that one of the 
reports that went through the IRC,

1815
01:17:36,471 --> 01:17:37,304
the cancer,
the place that declares things 

1816
01:17:38,841 --> 01:17:39,760
cancerous,
you know,

1817
01:17:39,761 --> 01:17:40,461
on their,
you know,

1818
01:17:40,461 --> 01:17:43,490
Group A,
one to a two hub,

1819
01:17:43,810 --> 01:17:44,990
um,
cancer,

1820
01:17:45,250 --> 01:17:46,400
uh,
classifications.

1821
01:17:46,520 --> 01:17:51,410
One of the reports was falsified that 
declared roundup a cancerous.

1822
01:17:51,411 --> 01:17:54,530
Now we also have to follow that up by 
the person who is.

1823
01:17:54,740 --> 01:17:55,573
I'm I have to hunt down this report,
but the person who was trying to say 

1824
01:17:58,581 --> 01:17:59,414
roundup is cancer because of a little 
bit of suspicion around it because it's 

1825
01:18:03,111 --> 01:18:03,944
been people have kicked around that it's
causing cancer or you know that your 

1826
01:18:07,160 --> 01:18:10,310
spleen to turn radioactive for you know,
forever.

1827
01:18:10,310 --> 01:18:12,590
And it's.
So is this like chem trails type thing?

1828
01:18:12,740 --> 01:18:17,090
A little bit like one of the things that
people talk about in terms of conspiracy

1829
01:18:17,091 --> 01:18:17,924
theory and it just,
it gets put into the public sphere so 

1830
01:18:19,641 --> 01:18:21,950
much that people start to believe it.
And here's the.

1831
01:18:21,980 --> 01:18:26,210
If I saw from evidence that roundup had 
caused issues,

1832
01:18:26,420 --> 01:18:28,580
I would say right away just get rid of 
it,

1833
01:18:28,581 --> 01:18:32,210
take it off the market and I keep on not
seeing from evidence of it.

1834
01:18:32,211 --> 01:18:33,860
Like one of the.
There was a study,

1835
01:18:34,070 --> 01:18:38,150
there's this group moms across our moms 
across America and it's.

1836
01:18:38,300 --> 01:18:39,133
I take,
I always get my scientific information 

1837
01:18:40,791 --> 01:18:41,624
for mom groups on the Internet,
but this group decided to do a breast 

1838
01:18:45,171 --> 01:18:47,750
milk study to see if roundup accumulated
in breast milk.

1839
01:18:47,990 --> 01:18:48,823
And the way the study was done was they 
just had women indiscriminately sending 

1840
01:18:53,091 --> 01:18:55,640
containers of breast milk,
uh,

1841
01:18:55,700 --> 01:18:56,990
to,
to them.

1842
01:18:56,990 --> 01:18:57,823
And they declared like the amount of 
roundup to be ridiculously high in the 

1843
01:19:02,151 --> 01:19:03,140
breast milk.
And I'm like,

1844
01:19:03,170 --> 01:19:07,020
did they just tell women to spray pump 
bottles of,

1845
01:19:07,160 --> 01:19:07,993
uh,
of roundup into these containers and 

1846
01:19:09,561 --> 01:19:10,820
then test it.
But it turned out.

1847
01:19:11,060 --> 01:19:13,790
And this just from knowing how 
analytical techniques work,

1848
01:19:13,791 --> 01:19:14,624
like I used to design the techniques by 
which we extracted a target pesticides 

1849
01:19:18,981 --> 01:19:20,380
from a matrix and,
you know,

1850
01:19:20,390 --> 01:19:23,780
analyze them on our,
on our big overpriced machinery.

1851
01:19:23,990 --> 01:19:26,630
But the,
a woman who is a breast milk,

1852
01:19:26,660 --> 01:19:30,260
a researcher out of a University of 
Washington was like,

1853
01:19:30,261 --> 01:19:35,030
this doesn't seem right.
So she designed an experiment to test if

1854
01:19:35,031 --> 01:19:36,710
roundup was accumulating and breast 
milk.

1855
01:19:36,711 --> 01:19:39,950
And she had it verified by an out by an 
independent lab,

1856
01:19:40,210 --> 01:19:40,780
um,
and it,

1857
01:19:40,780 --> 01:19:41,613
and they tested women specifically who 
worked in agriculture and she had their 

1858
01:19:44,601 --> 01:19:45,434
breast milk tested specifically on days 
where they were spraying roundup and 

1859
01:19:48,831 --> 01:19:49,970
there was nothing found.

1860
01:19:50,010 --> 01:19:51,920
Yeah.
But that's someone who's not necessarily

1861
01:19:51,921 --> 01:19:55,370
eating the food that someone is working 
with the food working with roundup.

1862
01:19:55,371 --> 01:19:56,204
Right.
And you would expect that if it was 

1863
01:19:57,081 --> 01:19:59,870
being sprayed.
Well they go to this way round the issue

1864
01:19:59,871 --> 01:20:01,320
though,
interrupt you.

1865
01:20:01,321 --> 01:20:03,530
But the issue is people eating it.
It's both.

1866
01:20:03,590 --> 01:20:05,660
Think about it this way.
If it's in the food supply,

1867
01:20:05,840 --> 01:20:07,500
um,
wouldn't they be eating as well?

1868
01:20:07,560 --> 01:20:08,393
I don't know.
I don't know what their diet is like if 

1869
01:20:09,601 --> 01:20:10,434
you're,
if you're getting it from people's 

1870
01:20:11,131 --> 01:20:11,964
breast milk and those people say there's
roundup in my breast milk and I've been 

1871
01:20:15,451 --> 01:20:17,830
eating genetically modified crops.
It's.

1872
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:18,833
Well the other question is if these are 
the people that are following a moms 

1873
01:20:21,511 --> 01:20:24,750
across America and their whole thing is 
that roundup is the devil.

1874
01:20:24,751 --> 01:20:26,460
So you think they're falsifying 
evidence?

1875
01:20:26,490 --> 01:20:27,323
I think that it was not a well 
controlled experiment and it will be 

1876
01:20:30,541 --> 01:20:32,220
interesting to see,
um,

1877
01:20:32,430 --> 01:20:33,263
to see how the experiment would come out
if the person who runs moms across 

1878
01:20:39,151 --> 01:20:41,300
America is and honeycut would work 
would,

1879
01:20:41,940 --> 01:20:42,773
how it would look if zen were to look in
on every step of the process with a 

1880
01:20:47,320 --> 01:20:49,680
Shelly Mcguire,
Dr Kelly Mcguire to see that,

1881
01:20:49,890 --> 01:20:50,490
uh,
you know,

1882
01:20:50,490 --> 01:20:51,323
these people ate food that should have 
been sprayed with roundup and worked in 

1883
01:20:54,751 --> 01:20:55,584
the field and then at the end to see if 
their breast milk came out with nothing 

1884
01:20:58,801 --> 01:20:59,070
in it.

1885
01:20:59,070 --> 01:21:00,270
So I think,
don't you,

1886
01:21:01,500 --> 01:21:06,500
don't you think that there'd be more 
likely to be some sort of conspiratorial

1887
01:21:07,651 --> 01:21:08,484
collusion with people that actually work
in farms that use roundup rather than 

1888
01:21:12,901 --> 01:21:15,560
someone who's just checking the breast 
milk.

1889
01:21:15,680 --> 01:21:16,513
It's like,
wouldn't you think that like if 

1890
01:21:16,951 --> 01:21:17,784
someone's trying to prove that roundup 
isn't showing up in breast milk and 

1891
01:21:20,521 --> 01:21:24,120
you've got a bunch of people that 
they're living relies on using roundup?

1892
01:21:24,150 --> 01:21:25,680
Well,
the farm workers themselves,

1893
01:21:25,770 --> 01:21:27,000
they'd want to be safe.
Right?

1894
01:21:27,590 --> 01:21:30,960
And I say that as someone who's worked 
at a pesticide company and when I worked

1895
01:21:30,961 --> 01:21:31,794
there,
I mean I was,

1896
01:21:31,950 --> 01:21:32,783
I was just an analytical chemist.
I'm not someone who had any investment 

1897
01:21:35,821 --> 01:21:38,790
in keeping that company safe from being 
yelled at.

1898
01:21:38,970 --> 01:21:41,370
I want it to be safe from the stuff I 
was working with.

1899
01:21:41,371 --> 01:21:42,204
But I found it weird that you feel like 
there's some sort of conspiracy with 

1900
01:21:44,281 --> 01:21:46,410
these moms that are checking their 
breast milk,

1901
01:21:46,411 --> 01:21:47,244
but you don't think there might possibly
be some shenanigans involved in the 

1902
01:21:50,431 --> 01:21:53,520
people that actually need roundup to 
make a living.

1903
01:21:53,810 --> 01:21:54,643
It's no,
I understand what you're saying for 

1904
01:21:55,411 --> 01:21:56,244
sure.
But part of the reason why I think that 

1905
01:21:58,470 --> 01:22:02,490
Dr Mcguire would have conducted a better
study was number one,

1906
01:22:02,491 --> 01:22:03,324
in independently verified a number two 
knows how to do collection evidence are 

1907
01:22:07,740 --> 01:22:11,430
not ambulance a specimen collection 
accurately and number three,

1908
01:22:11,460 --> 01:22:15,030
monitored and independently verified 
from an outside lab.

1909
01:22:15,240 --> 01:22:17,130
So it's like we don't have.
And when,

1910
01:22:17,220 --> 01:22:20,070
uh,
when moms across America was asked,

1911
01:22:20,240 --> 01:22:21,073
uh,
to show their data and how they 

1912
01:22:22,861 --> 01:22:26,380
collected the samples they didn't give,
they weren't willing to,

1913
01:22:26,500 --> 01:22:28,090
to share,
uh,

1914
01:22:28,140 --> 01:22:28,973
their,
all of their data on how specimen 

1915
01:22:30,901 --> 01:22:32,130
collection,
uh,

1916
01:22:32,190 --> 01:22:33,023
was,
was excuse for not sharing that I don't 

1917
01:22:36,001 --> 01:22:37,920
recall off the top of my head,
but they weren't like,

1918
01:22:37,921 --> 01:22:38,754
it's,
it seems suspicious to me that they 

1919
01:22:39,631 --> 01:22:43,110
weren't willing to disclose that when 
you're,

1920
01:22:43,111 --> 01:22:44,520
when you do an experiment,
everything.

1921
01:22:44,521 --> 01:22:46,590
And I mean I used to work under glp 
standards,

1922
01:22:46,591 --> 01:22:49,200
which basically you throw out a glove,
you have to write it down.

1923
01:22:49,410 --> 01:22:52,140
And that's,
that's part of the standards and how you

1924
01:22:52,141 --> 01:22:52,801
get,
you know,

1925
01:22:52,801 --> 01:22:53,634
a chemical into a,
into use in agriculture is you really 

1926
01:22:57,241 --> 01:23:02,241
have to be careful and,
and forthcoming on how you do your work.

1927
01:23:02,821 --> 01:23:06,340
Which was the amount of pesticides that 
they in breast milk uniform.

1928
01:23:06,510 --> 01:23:08,500
It's,
I believe that I didn't,

1929
01:23:08,680 --> 01:23:12,910
I don't think there were only testing 
for roundup and they found there to be.

1930
01:23:12,940 --> 01:23:15,280
They didn't find there to be even trace 
amounts,

1931
01:23:15,281 --> 01:23:16,114
which I was kind of surprised that I 
would have expected something in the 

1932
01:23:18,810 --> 01:23:21,040
moms across America stuff they found a 
lot.

1933
01:23:21,100 --> 01:23:22,120
Yeah.
What was the uniform?

1934
01:23:22,121 --> 01:23:22,954
Was it,
did everybody have like a similar 

1935
01:23:23,591 --> 01:23:24,250
amount?
No,

1936
01:23:24,250 --> 01:23:26,560
they found in the amount of varied and 
they were,

1937
01:23:26,620 --> 01:23:28,240
they were so high.
It was like,

1938
01:23:28,241 --> 01:23:29,860
it was just somebody dripped some in 
there.

1939
01:23:30,130 --> 01:23:32,050
It was suspicious and that's why I was 
like,

1940
01:23:32,051 --> 01:23:34,090
I don't like that was why I didn't buy 
it.

1941
01:23:34,090 --> 01:23:36,010
The other thing is they used a 
technique,

1942
01:23:36,250 --> 01:23:37,083
a,
an analytical technique that was used 

1943
01:23:38,621 --> 01:23:39,454
for water and that's why I'm like,
this is not like not all techniques you 

1944
01:23:42,190 --> 01:23:45,040
use for all work for all chemical 
matrices.

1945
01:23:45,310 --> 01:23:47,410
So that's another reason why,
uh,

1946
01:23:47,440 --> 01:23:48,730
you know,
a different lab,

1947
01:23:48,790 --> 01:23:49,623
uh,
was probably better equipped to handle 

1948
01:23:51,401 --> 01:23:52,234
it.
One specifically that analyzes breast 

1949
01:23:53,141 --> 01:23:54,100
milk.
Um,

1950
01:23:54,130 --> 01:23:56,590
so it's,
I think like the other thing is,

1951
01:23:56,591 --> 01:23:57,820
you know,
that the other lab,

1952
01:23:58,300 --> 01:23:59,133
the other lab kind of had a bias going 
in because their whole thing is how 

1953
01:24:01,840 --> 01:24:03,600
roundup is bad.
So lab,

1954
01:24:03,601 --> 01:24:05,230
it's like,
I just want to know if,

1955
01:24:05,260 --> 01:24:07,180
you know moms are being harmed,
if there's breast,

1956
01:24:07,240 --> 01:24:08,073
if there's something in the,
in the breastmilk that seems like a lab 

1957
01:24:11,561 --> 01:24:12,011
that,
you know,

1958
01:24:12,011 --> 01:24:16,060
went in just wanting to know the other 
lab went in saying I hate roundup.

1959
01:24:16,240 --> 01:24:18,780
So if I would have,
if,

1960
01:24:18,870 --> 01:24:19,703
if roundup had been found in a,
in the test that Dr Mcguire's lab had 

1961
01:24:23,291 --> 01:24:24,124
done,
I would have happily accepted those 

1962
01:24:25,481 --> 01:24:27,730
results because you know,
it almost wouldn't.

1963
01:24:28,270 --> 01:24:32,140
It would have surprised me not in the 
least if it had been found,

1964
01:24:32,141 --> 01:24:32,974
but I was kind of,
I was Kinda glad that there was nothing 

1965
01:24:34,750 --> 01:24:36,400
there because it means that,
you know,

1966
01:24:36,820 --> 01:24:40,750
babies aren't getting a concentrated 
dose of this just because you know,

1967
01:24:40,751 --> 01:24:44,020
you don't want extraneous chemicals 
going into the food supply.

1968
01:24:44,080 --> 01:24:46,480
Only testing people that worked in these
farms.

1969
01:24:46,481 --> 01:24:47,590
Is that,
was that the idea?

1970
01:24:48,500 --> 01:24:50,980
I think they did.
I don't remember off the top of my head,

1971
01:24:50,981 --> 01:24:52,600
but I know one of the people,
one of the groups,

1972
01:24:52,601 --> 01:24:55,540
they did test for women on testing days,
but they go to this way.

1973
01:24:55,541 --> 01:24:57,070
They're not just spraying it.
They're also,

1974
01:24:57,150 --> 01:24:59,460
you know,
possibly eating food that's been a,

1975
01:24:59,500 --> 01:25:01,930
that's added on there.
That's possibly,

1976
01:25:02,040 --> 01:25:02,873
it would be more interested in seeing it
100 percent sure that these people were 

1977
01:25:06,251 --> 01:25:07,084
eating food that makes sense with 
roundup and that doesn't make sense to 

1978
01:25:09,911 --> 01:25:10,990
me that they didn't do that.

1979
01:25:11,130 --> 01:25:11,740
It's,
I'm,

1980
01:25:11,740 --> 01:25:12,310
you know,
I,

1981
01:25:12,310 --> 01:25:14,430
I'd have to,
I want to have a look at the study again

1982
01:25:14,450 --> 01:25:15,340
myself,
just to be,

1983
01:25:15,820 --> 01:25:18,520
just to be sure of what the weather 
conditions were before.

1984
01:25:18,521 --> 01:25:21,040
I'm curious about both tests.
Have a,

1985
01:25:21,160 --> 01:25:22,190
have a look.
Um,

1986
01:25:22,320 --> 01:25:27,320
we can have a quick peek a after it for 
Dr Maguire breastmilk roundup study,

1987
01:25:28,590 --> 01:25:29,423
you know,
the whole thing seems a little weird to 

1988
01:25:30,191 --> 01:25:31,024
me.
It's weird that one group test group 

1989
01:25:34,421 --> 01:25:35,440
test.
Not at all.

1990
01:25:35,710 --> 01:25:37,330
It's,
it is.

1991
01:25:37,450 --> 01:25:42,010
I'm going to say it is easy to screw up 
a study,

1992
01:25:42,011 --> 01:25:43,090
uh,
using,

1993
01:25:43,140 --> 01:25:46,060
um,
if you're not sure the parameters you're

1994
01:25:46,061 --> 01:25:48,100
supposed to use in an analytical,
uh,

1995
01:25:48,110 --> 01:25:48,943
in,
in a chemical analysis a thing because 

1996
01:25:51,431 --> 01:25:52,264
you can have interfering species that 
come up with the same peaks at the same 

1997
01:25:54,341 --> 01:25:55,480
time.
Uh,

1998
01:25:55,481 --> 01:25:56,950
so I'm.
The other thing is,

1999
01:25:56,980 --> 01:25:57,670
like I said,
we,

2000
01:25:57,670 --> 01:25:58,503
the biggest thing is we don't know the 
collection parameters for the one that 

2001
01:26:01,271 --> 01:26:04,180
mom across America did,
so they won't tell us.

2002
01:26:04,490 --> 01:26:05,323
It's the other thing is Dr Maguire was 
doing it through a university and she 

2003
01:26:08,991 --> 01:26:10,970
could've been,
she could've been in a lot of trouble if

2004
01:26:10,971 --> 01:26:11,804
she'd a falsified a or data or done or 
done a test that was purposefully 

2005
01:26:17,031 --> 01:26:17,980
misleading.
Right.

2006
01:26:18,230 --> 01:26:19,063
So that's what are the pesticides.
Did you google the best asides that are 

2007
01:26:21,951 --> 01:26:22,650
acceptable

2008
01:26:22,650 --> 01:26:24,020
as a firm?
The put them up.

2009
01:26:25,090 --> 01:26:27,000
There's a long list somewhere,
but the,

2010
01:26:27,001 --> 01:26:31,120
uh,
I had it here.

2011
01:26:31,400 --> 01:26:35,130
It's on the usaid or USD,
a good.gov website.

2012
01:26:35,190 --> 01:26:36,023
It just,
it's like a standards of what they use 

2013
01:26:37,271 --> 01:26:38,104
to put stuff on and off of it.
And there are a organic standards that 

2014
01:26:42,721 --> 01:26:43,554
allow some substances,
but where they're mostly trying to get 

2015
01:26:45,631 --> 01:26:47,250
out synthetic substances.
However,

2016
01:26:47,251 --> 01:26:50,070
there are also some synthetic substances
that are allowed to.

2017
01:26:50,640 --> 01:26:53,910
Interesting.
And this is to label something organic,

2018
01:26:53,940 --> 01:26:54,773
right?
And then there's a board that votes on 

2019
01:26:55,531 --> 01:26:56,364
it from time to time.
If somebody wants to bring something up 

2020
01:26:57,931 --> 01:27:00,240
and disagree that it shouldn't be on 
that list.

2021
01:27:00,280 --> 01:27:01,480
Isn't that weird though?
I mean,

2022
01:27:01,660 --> 01:27:05,860
most people think you say organic.
Most people think there's no pesticides.

2023
01:27:05,980 --> 01:27:07,750
Most people think you're just growing 
plants.

2024
01:27:07,910 --> 01:27:10,130
Yep,
and that's I.

2025
01:27:10,570 --> 01:27:12,760
They sell that so well,
don't they?

2026
01:27:13,150 --> 01:27:13,983
It's,

2027
01:27:14,490 --> 01:27:17,520
for instance,
for Mons pheromones,

2028
01:27:17,640 --> 01:27:20,280
pheromones,
pheromones,

2029
01:27:20,490 --> 01:27:22,080
pheromones,
pheromones.

2030
01:27:22,081 --> 01:27:22,914
Have long been used as effective,
nontoxic ways to confuse insects that 

2031
01:27:28,261 --> 01:27:31,890
might otherwise infest organic crops,
especially fruit,

2032
01:27:32,130 --> 01:27:36,030
so they put some certain smells just 
free bugs out.

2033
01:27:36,750 --> 01:27:39,240
Likewise,
vaccines for animals are important.

2034
01:27:39,241 --> 01:27:42,750
Disease Prevention tools against many 
infectious diseases,

2035
01:27:42,751 --> 01:27:43,051
blah,
blah,

2036
01:27:43,051 --> 01:27:43,884
blah.
Especially since antibiotic therapy is 

2037
01:27:44,881 --> 01:27:46,020
prohibited in livestock.

2038
01:27:46,630 --> 01:27:47,463
Picturing an anti-vaxxer staying away 
from organic produce because they 

2039
01:27:50,321 --> 01:27:52,060
vaccinated it against bees.

2040
01:27:52,260 --> 01:27:53,490
Well,
you can always grow your own food,

2041
01:27:53,491 --> 01:27:54,380
folks,
you know,

2042
01:27:54,780 --> 01:27:55,613
and not put anything on it,
but I think large scale domestic 

2043
01:27:58,441 --> 01:27:59,274
agriculture,
if you're talking about these gigantic 

2044
01:28:01,201 --> 01:28:03,330
fields,
nothing could be less natural.

2045
01:28:03,750 --> 01:28:06,720
It's not normal to have a thousand acres
of corn.

2046
01:28:06,810 --> 01:28:09,240
It just doesn't exist in the wild.
And when you do that,

2047
01:28:09,241 --> 01:28:10,440
you're going to run into a lot of 
problems.

2048
01:28:10,500 --> 01:28:11,333
Since I always go back to the argument 
of nothing we're doing is natural 

2049
01:28:13,441 --> 01:28:15,390
anyway.
We're sitting in a,

2050
01:28:15,391 --> 01:28:18,700
in an air conditioned studio in 
California that we.

2051
01:28:18,720 --> 01:28:19,553
We'd probably be.
We'd be dead with a lot of the things 

2052
01:28:21,511 --> 01:28:23,380
that we don't have.
That's,

2053
01:28:23,410 --> 01:28:25,830
that's Kebab food.
There's no food around here.

2054
01:28:25,850 --> 01:28:27,610
Where are you growing food?
It was.

2055
01:28:27,680 --> 01:28:29,260
No one's grown food anywhere near us.
There's,

2056
01:28:29,290 --> 01:28:30,123
there's nothing that we enjoy that 
that's natural anymore as natural and 

2057
01:28:34,411 --> 01:28:36,570
it's God damn delicious.
We got a freezer.

2058
01:28:36,630 --> 01:28:39,920
How do you get a freezer?
It's like I like.

2059
01:28:39,921 --> 01:28:42,980
You want natural bear attacks?
Asteroids.

2060
01:28:43,050 --> 01:28:44,490
Well,
I think there's a little sticker.

2061
01:28:44,491 --> 01:28:47,160
Things that come out of trees.
Those are all natural,

2062
01:28:47,190 --> 01:28:48,660
so you're going to say stickers or 
groups.

2063
01:28:50,290 --> 01:28:54,030
It's groups.
Jesus made those himself.

2064
01:28:54,031 --> 01:28:54,240
What's

2065
01:28:54,240 --> 01:28:56,310
up?
Something on the company that made those

2066
01:28:56,311 --> 01:28:57,144
stickers.
I was going to bring this up a second 

2067
01:28:58,141 --> 01:28:58,890
ago.
Oh,

2068
01:28:58,890 --> 01:29:01,980
I went to their website and it's a.
They have this thing called

2069
01:29:01,980 --> 01:29:04,080
a digestive solution.
Energy card.

2070
01:29:04,320 --> 01:29:05,110
Oh,
Jesus.

2071
01:29:05,110 --> 01:29:10,110
All the digestive solution.
Energy card.

2072
01:29:10,830 --> 01:29:13,380
What in the fuck is this?
Now?

2073
01:29:13,530 --> 01:29:16,020
Look at this.
You can now in all caps,

2074
01:29:16,021 --> 01:29:19,500
bold letters,
boosts your body energy signature,

2075
01:29:19,501 --> 01:29:20,334
all,
all bold by simply placing this 

2076
01:29:23,610 --> 01:29:28,560
digestive solution tm energy card,
under your food plate,

2077
01:29:28,561 --> 01:29:29,394
holy fuck,
and the beverage of your choice and 

2078
01:29:31,711 --> 01:29:35,470
receive energy from the card instantly 
you motherfuckers.

2079
01:29:36,130 --> 01:29:36,963
The energy card has a magnetic strip 
embedded in the back that holds 

2080
01:29:40,621 --> 01:29:41,454
digitally enhanced information that once
your food or beverage comes in contact 

2081
01:29:45,211 --> 01:29:46,044
with it,
the energy is delivered immediately to 

2082
01:29:47,731 --> 01:29:48,564
the food and beverage there by boosting 
the energy to your food to maximize 

2083
01:29:52,771 --> 01:29:54,060
their nutrition.
You consume.

2084
01:29:54,330 --> 01:29:59,330
You fucking criminals should be in jail.
You guys are monsters.

2085
01:29:59,990 --> 01:30:03,960
Gwyneth paltrow just broke as shit.
The digestive energy card,

2086
01:30:04,890 --> 01:30:05,723
digestive solution,
ng card is an energetically enhanced 

2087
01:30:08,061 --> 01:30:08,420
product.

2088
01:30:08,420 --> 01:30:09,253
What?
Yeah,

2089
01:30:09,500 --> 01:30:11,640
that's what it is.
Hold on a second.

2090
01:30:11,670 --> 01:30:13,050
Look at that.
Look at that sentence,

2091
01:30:13,200 --> 01:30:15,630
that digestive energy,
the digestive solution.

2092
01:30:15,631 --> 01:30:19,260
Energy card is an energetically enhanced
products.

2093
01:30:19,650 --> 01:30:20,730
That's shit.
English.

2094
01:30:21,360 --> 01:30:22,193
Our engineers have achieved the correct 
ratio response of frequency signatures 

2095
01:30:27,511 --> 01:30:28,344
through a technology that matches the 
same energy received from the nutrients 

2096
01:30:31,441 --> 01:30:32,274
you get from the food you eat and drink.
You know this guys wearing in toe shoes 

2097
01:30:35,941 --> 01:30:36,930
when he wrote this,
right?

2098
01:30:37,830 --> 01:30:41,010
We consume food.
It converts into chemical energy,

2099
01:30:41,011 --> 01:30:43,500
which provides a nutritional needs for 
energy and growth.

2100
01:30:43,770 --> 01:30:44,603
This connection is defined by the laws 
of thermodynamics that requires all 

2101
01:30:49,561 --> 01:30:53,340
humans to burn food for energy.
You guys are fucking cunts.

2102
01:30:53,910 --> 01:30:58,830
What is the name of this company?
This is an Alpha biocentric concert.

2103
01:30:58,831 --> 01:30:59,930
Warm,
lovely place.

2104
01:30:59,931 --> 01:31:01,130
This.
These people are asking.

2105
01:31:01,300 --> 01:31:06,300
That's a totally different thing.
A suggested retail price.

2106
01:31:06,421 --> 01:31:07,440
Seventy $9.

2107
01:31:07,440 --> 01:31:09,870
Oh my God.
The card is guaranteed for two years.

2108
01:31:09,871 --> 01:31:12,000
It looks like a credit card fame,
but that's just listening.

2109
01:31:12,090 --> 01:31:14,850
It is a credit card.
I mean it's 100 percent bullshit.

2110
01:31:16,140 --> 01:31:16,973
God Damn.
How the fuck does someone get away with 

2111
01:31:18,331 --> 01:31:20,010
this?
This is horrible.

2112
01:31:20,760 --> 01:31:24,120
I have no good.
You just imagine the idea that you could

2113
01:31:24,121 --> 01:31:26,550
put a card under your food.
It makes your food better.

2114
01:31:27,190 --> 01:31:30,060
I'm trying to figure it because they're 
saying it energetically enhances it.

2115
01:31:30,061 --> 01:31:35,061
Does this mean it adds calories to it or
does its nutrient transfer?

2116
01:31:36,390 --> 01:31:40,980
Whatever the fuck those dynamics.
I keep using these words.

2117
01:31:40,981 --> 01:31:45,210
I don't think they know what they mean.
There's a lot of people that like to use

2118
01:31:45,211 --> 01:31:46,590
those sciencey words,
right?

2119
01:31:46,860 --> 01:31:50,200
It's like chiropractors,
subluxations somebody.

2120
01:31:50,550 --> 01:31:52,530
They always say that.
I remember them saying that all the time

2121
01:31:52,531 --> 01:31:55,260
to one doctor.
He adjusted me five minutes,

2122
01:31:55,261 --> 01:31:56,580
right?
One hundred 40 bucks.

2123
01:31:56,581 --> 01:31:58,050
Then he goes,
make sure you drink a lot of water.

2124
01:31:58,051 --> 01:31:58,730
I'm like,
why?

2125
01:31:58,730 --> 01:32:00,190
To wash the fucking taste

2126
01:32:00,190 --> 01:32:02,470
out of my mouth.
You asshole.

2127
01:32:02,530 --> 01:32:04,210
You didn't do anything.
This is crazy.

2128
01:32:04,360 --> 01:32:05,770
The bullshit down.
Yeah.

2129
01:32:05,800 --> 01:32:06,633
Wash the bullshit goes,
goes better with what is the response 

2130
01:32:09,731 --> 01:32:11,050
been?
I mean,

2131
01:32:11,051 --> 01:32:12,070
he must have gotten a lot better.

2132
01:32:12,080 --> 01:32:13,610
A lot of swearing.
Oh God.

2133
01:32:13,660 --> 01:32:15,710
Twitter.
Twitter was an angry.

2134
01:32:16,090 --> 01:32:16,923
I'm still getting angry.
Tweets like people that use it or from 

2135
01:32:19,781 --> 01:32:22,380
chiropractors themselves,
fewer chiropractice.

2136
01:32:22,400 --> 01:32:27,400
Some chiropractors and a lot of people 
who who love Chiropractic and are mad at

2137
01:32:28,781 --> 01:32:29,614
me because I think people think I'm 
calling them stupid for using 

2138
01:32:31,421 --> 01:32:32,320
chiropractor,
but I'm like,

2139
01:32:32,321 --> 01:32:33,890
no,
you got you.

2140
01:32:33,910 --> 01:32:34,743
You got a lot of us.
I mean it's like I would basically be 

2141
01:32:39,671 --> 01:32:43,780
calling half my fan base a stupid if,
if that were the case and I'm not.

2142
01:32:43,781 --> 01:32:46,240
And I felt kinda bad because a good 
friend of mine,

2143
01:32:46,570 --> 01:32:50,440
like she like after she gave birth,
she had like a severe enough injury that

2144
01:32:50,441 --> 01:32:55,060
she could barely walk and a chiropractor
basically from massaging the area,

2145
01:32:55,270 --> 01:32:58,540
got her up and walking and she's like.
And the thing she said to me was,

2146
01:32:58,541 --> 01:33:01,090
I'm tired of being called a lemming 
moron.

2147
01:33:01,091 --> 01:33:02,560
I'm like,
I never use number one.

2148
01:33:02,561 --> 01:33:04,960
I never insulted people who use 
chiropractic.

2149
01:33:04,961 --> 01:33:06,010
And number two,
I definitely didn't.

2150
01:33:06,020 --> 01:33:06,853
You use those two words.
And I think people got the impression 

2151
01:33:09,671 --> 01:33:12,670
that I was calling everyone who used 
chiropractor's dumb.

2152
01:33:12,671 --> 01:33:15,400
And it's like,
that's never the point of my writing.

2153
01:33:15,401 --> 01:33:18,940
It's like you're not the Moron for 
falling for this.

2154
01:33:19,090 --> 01:33:21,040
They're the assholes for selling it.

2155
01:33:21,060 --> 01:33:21,893
Don't even know of.
A lot of them are assholes because I 

2156
01:33:23,871 --> 01:33:26,000
don't know if a lot of them have even 
looked into this.

2157
01:33:26,001 --> 01:33:26,834
You know,
I've talked to some chiropractors about 

2158
01:33:28,281 --> 01:33:29,114
this stuff that's been going on over the
last couple of weeks since your article 

2159
01:33:31,581 --> 01:33:32,414
and since I did my podcast,
since we've talked about it several 

2160
01:33:34,671 --> 01:33:35,504
times,
I just don't think they understand the 

2161
01:33:37,161 --> 01:33:38,120
origins of this

2162
01:33:38,210 --> 01:33:39,043
or that it's or the stuff they're 
selling isn't considered scientifically 

2163
01:33:41,910 --> 01:33:42,743
validated

2164
01:33:42,750 --> 01:33:45,930
kid and you're getting out of high 
school and into college and you know,

2165
01:33:45,931 --> 01:33:46,764
you want to get involved in something 
therapeutic in chiropractic medicine 

2166
01:33:50,101 --> 01:33:50,934
seems like a good thing and you start 
going to chiropractic school like you 

2167
01:33:54,151 --> 01:33:56,160
might not even know.
And I,

2168
01:33:56,640 --> 01:33:59,910
I really do sympathize with a lot of 
chiropractors who are out there.

2169
01:34:00,000 --> 01:34:02,040
They have emailed me like,
hey man,

2170
01:34:02,310 --> 01:34:04,920
like what you're saying could 
potentially destroy my business.

2171
01:34:05,730 --> 01:34:06,563
I understand and I sympathize,
but you've got to understand that if I 

2172
01:34:11,251 --> 01:34:14,190
knew about this and I didn't talk about 
it,

2173
01:34:14,460 --> 01:34:15,293
that would be more horrible.
I have a responsibility if I find 

2174
01:34:19,501 --> 01:34:20,334
something out like this,
like the guy who invented as a fucking 

2175
01:34:22,330 --> 01:34:25,170
quack and a magnetic healer and you're 
not really going to medical school.

2176
01:34:25,510 --> 01:34:29,190
There's a responsibility that you have 
to say something about that.

2177
01:34:29,210 --> 01:34:30,043
Yeah,
and I just think people are thinking 

2178
01:34:31,651 --> 01:34:33,620
about themselves.
They're thinking about,

2179
01:34:33,621 --> 01:34:34,081
you know,
hey,

2180
01:34:34,081 --> 01:34:34,914
I've got bills and hey,
I've got this and I've got to practice 

2181
01:34:36,991 --> 01:34:39,060
and I've got this other job.
Yeah.

2182
01:34:39,061 --> 01:34:42,240
I don't want to be the guy that tells 
you what to do,

2183
01:34:42,510 --> 01:34:46,050
but you can't get upset at someone 
saying something.

2184
01:34:46,051 --> 01:34:46,884
That's if I made up the fact that 
chiropractic medicine was founded by a 

2185
01:34:49,501 --> 01:34:52,560
magnetic healer and he was killed by his
own son.

2186
01:34:52,770 --> 01:34:56,850
Do you know the story behind that was 
run over by his son.

2187
01:34:57,080 --> 01:34:58,160
His son ran him over

2188
01:34:58,160 --> 01:35:01,160
with a fucking car and they think you 
might've done it on purpose and this son

2189
01:35:01,161 --> 01:35:01,994
apparently was a fucking huge fraud and 
the son went on to be the one who 

2190
01:35:04,941 --> 01:35:08,930
promoted chiropractic.
Medicine was really promoted by the sun.

2191
01:35:09,080 --> 01:35:10,670
Yeah,
it's in the wikipedia.

2192
01:35:11,060 --> 01:35:14,300
Pull up the wikipedia on chiropractic 
controversies.

2193
01:35:14,850 --> 01:35:17,390
This that.
There's a real,

2194
01:35:17,391 --> 01:35:18,224
a theory that the son murdered the dad 
and the son murdered the dad to take 

2195
01:35:22,881 --> 01:35:25,310
over the business and then he's the one 
who pushed chiropractic.

2196
01:35:25,320 --> 01:35:26,153
Madison,
I think we had to cut it off at some 

2197
01:35:27,351 --> 01:35:29,460
point because the article was 40,000 
words.

2198
01:35:29,470 --> 01:35:30,500
Yeah,
I'm sure.

2199
01:35:30,560 --> 01:35:31,311
Right.
Here we go.

2200
01:35:31,311 --> 01:35:32,180
What are you out of here?
Jamie?

2201
01:35:33,230 --> 01:35:34,700
Wikipedia.
This is death.

2202
01:35:34,701 --> 01:35:36,760
It says there's a book about.
Yeah.

2203
01:35:36,770 --> 01:35:41,540
Homecoming parade that sets hilarious 
injuries by his son.

2204
01:35:41,590 --> 01:35:42,423
Yeah.
He fucking random over his son ran him 

2205
01:35:44,031 --> 01:35:47,450
over.
Attempted patricide.

2206
01:35:47,700 --> 01:35:48,533
Yeah.

2207
01:35:49,290 --> 01:35:51,230
That's uh,
that's fun.

2208
01:35:51,830 --> 01:35:54,380
There was speculation that it was an 
accident,

2209
01:35:55,160 --> 01:35:56,740
but instead,
wow.

2210
01:35:57,560 --> 01:36:02,120
A case of attempted patricide that's.
But that it was not an accident.

2211
01:36:02,510 --> 01:36:03,950
No one knows.
So who knows?

2212
01:36:04,100 --> 01:36:05,360
I mean,
you're talking about some shit that went

2213
01:36:05,361 --> 01:36:08,600
down the 18 hundreds or actually 1913 I 
guess.

2214
01:36:08,601 --> 01:36:12,800
Huh?
So 1913 Bj Palmer ran over his dad,

2215
01:36:12,830 --> 01:36:16,820
dd Palmer and.
Yeah.

2216
01:36:16,910 --> 01:36:20,510
And that guy is filled with fucking 
problems too.

2217
01:36:20,511 --> 01:36:22,490
If you look into him.
The son,

2218
01:36:22,640 --> 01:36:25,340
apparently the sun was a massive fraud.
So in a sense,

2219
01:36:25,790 --> 01:36:26,623
chiropractic medicine was founded by a 
quack and promoted by a fraud and 

2220
01:36:29,140 --> 01:36:31,030
might've murders dad.
Well,

2221
01:36:31,370 --> 01:36:36,370
how the fuck does it get so far?
That's the most stunning thing about it.

2222
01:36:37,460 --> 01:36:39,010
It's,
it's a thing where like it,

2223
01:36:39,020 --> 01:36:41,250
it took root before,
like,

2224
01:36:41,640 --> 01:36:43,250
like I said before,
real medicine was,

2225
01:36:43,270 --> 01:36:45,760
was starting and it just,
it kept going like,

2226
01:36:46,040 --> 01:36:50,450
well medicine was making attempts at 
other things and some of them failed and

2227
01:36:50,451 --> 01:36:51,330
some of them stayed.
Like,

2228
01:36:51,350 --> 01:36:54,050
think about around that time was when 
Bayer was like,

2229
01:36:54,051 --> 01:36:58,010
we have a new miracle cure heroin like 
that.

2230
01:36:58,190 --> 01:36:59,330
There was a lot of shit going on.
Yeah.

2231
01:36:59,400 --> 01:37:01,700
So I mean like they weren't teams and 
Coca Cola.

2232
01:37:01,750 --> 01:37:04,010
Yeah,
like they were trying at real things and

2233
01:37:04,011 --> 01:37:05,270
failing,
but at least they were.

2234
01:37:05,360 --> 01:37:07,760
They were trying.
Like these guys were like,

2235
01:37:07,761 --> 01:37:10,010
hey,
we had a launch check nudge motherfucker

2236
01:37:10,011 --> 01:37:11,930
out and that didn't work so well

2237
01:37:11,990 --> 01:37:12,823
without the Internet.
People would not have had this 

2238
01:37:14,331 --> 01:37:15,164
information.
Like when I first started going to 

2239
01:37:16,131 --> 01:37:16,964
chiropractors was probably 20 years ago.
No one had this information wasn't 

2240
01:37:20,901 --> 01:37:22,220
available.
No one knew.

2241
01:37:22,460 --> 01:37:23,600
You just thought,
oh,

2242
01:37:23,630 --> 01:37:26,000
he's a doctor.
It says doctor of Chiropractic.

2243
01:37:26,030 --> 01:37:26,863
Oh,
he's a guy who studied chiropractic 

2244
01:37:27,891 --> 01:37:28,390
medicine

2245
01:37:28,390 --> 01:37:29,920
and I love it.
So many of them just say,

2246
01:37:29,921 --> 01:37:30,754
doctor.
And you have to dig through their 

2247
01:37:31,661 --> 01:37:33,850
website for where it eventually says 
chiropractic.

2248
01:37:34,150 --> 01:37:34,983
How can you fucking call yourself a 
doctor if you don't go to medical 

2249
01:37:36,821 --> 01:37:37,620
school?
Isn't,

2250
01:37:37,620 --> 01:37:39,680
shouldn't there be some sort of a 
national standard on it?

2251
01:37:40,170 --> 01:37:42,530
It's funny because a lot of them,
like I and I,

2252
01:37:42,540 --> 01:37:46,020
I dunno if this should bug me or not 
because like you'll see dr somewhere and

2253
01:37:46,021 --> 01:37:46,854
the,
the mds will say md really carefully or 

2254
01:37:49,231 --> 01:37:50,064
pediatrician,
although will be very careful to say 

2255
01:37:51,271 --> 01:37:54,630
what type of doctor they are.
If someone like now I'm very leery.

2256
01:37:54,631 --> 01:37:56,490
If I just Dr [inaudible].
I'm like,

2257
01:37:56,491 --> 01:37:57,324
all right,
are they had like what breed of doctor 

2258
01:37:59,311 --> 01:38:01,320
are they?
Do they have a phd?

2259
01:38:01,350 --> 01:38:03,060
Do they have,
are they a chiropractor,

2260
01:38:03,061 --> 01:38:05,370
league of IC doctrine that I see some 
bullshit on their page.

2261
01:38:05,371 --> 01:38:07,600
I'm like,
what type of doctor are they?

2262
01:38:07,610 --> 01:38:10,390
Because like everyone wants you to think
like,

2263
01:38:10,410 --> 01:38:12,990
or I think people just want you to think
that there are medical doctor,

2264
01:38:13,320 --> 01:38:14,150
uh,
and that,

2265
01:38:14,150 --> 01:38:14,983
that way that title has a lot of weight.
So people will take shit advice if they 

2266
01:38:18,121 --> 01:38:20,100
see dr period in front of the name.

2267
01:38:20,310 --> 01:38:22,920
Bill cosby was a doctor for awhile too.
They took it back.

2268
01:38:22,950 --> 01:38:24,990
I apparently people were taking some 
drugs from him.

2269
01:38:25,560 --> 01:38:28,770
They just didn't know it.
They gave him an honorary doctorate.

2270
01:38:28,771 --> 01:38:30,210
Doctorates are also weird.
Right?

2271
01:38:30,211 --> 01:38:34,500
Because if you get a doctorate you can 
be called a doctor Dr Cosby,

2272
01:38:34,740 --> 01:38:36,330
but you don't have to have better.
Also.

2273
01:38:36,390 --> 01:38:39,930
We need a new word for that.
It's someone who's got a doctorate.

2274
01:38:39,931 --> 01:38:40,764
Shouldn't be a fucking doctor and say I 
go back and forth on that one because I 

2275
01:38:43,261 --> 01:38:44,230
have friends who,
you know,

2276
01:38:44,250 --> 01:38:45,083
had their phds and like you're kind of,
you call them doctor and then like when 

2277
01:38:48,871 --> 01:38:51,720
I think I feel like when they email 
people generally in the signature line,

2278
01:38:51,721 --> 01:38:52,554
it's,
you know,

2279
01:38:52,650 --> 01:38:56,350
it's Joe Schmo Phd.
Like they make sense.

2280
01:38:56,550 --> 01:38:57,383
Yeah.
It's like they signed things phd in 

2281
01:38:58,291 --> 01:39:01,860
general just to not be a dick about it,
but it's like the,

2282
01:39:01,880 --> 01:39:02,370
it's.

2283
01:39:02,370 --> 01:39:05,880
I feel like putting Dr Blank when you're
a phd.

2284
01:39:05,881 --> 01:39:08,670
It's like I feel like it can cause some 
confusion.

2285
01:39:08,820 --> 01:39:10,700
Dr Laura,
Dr Laura.

2286
01:39:10,701 --> 01:39:14,430
She a doctor was a Dr Phil.
Dr Phil's a doctor.

2287
01:39:14,431 --> 01:39:17,610
He's not a psychologist or which one of 
you is off the top of my head.

2288
01:39:17,611 --> 01:39:18,444
I feel like there was a doctorate in 
there somewhere or a phd or something 

2289
01:39:21,520 --> 01:39:22,353
like,
there's so many of them that just don't 

2290
01:39:22,891 --> 01:39:24,060
have what they say.
It's funny because,

2291
01:39:24,061 --> 01:39:24,841
uh,
what's his face?

2292
01:39:24,841 --> 01:39:27,780
Dr Oz.
Really good cardiothoracic surgeon.

2293
01:39:27,820 --> 01:39:29,580
Bullshit.
Or on TV though.

2294
01:39:29,581 --> 01:39:30,414
He's so scary.
Like I sell a miracle cures for weight 

2295
01:39:32,341 --> 01:39:33,280
loss.
It's gotten.

2296
01:39:33,290 --> 01:39:35,070
It's funny because since Congress told 
them,

2297
01:39:35,071 --> 01:39:36,960
cut the shit.
He's been in Congress.

2298
01:39:37,030 --> 01:39:37,863
It's still on TV.
He's been less full of shit but still a 

2299
01:39:41,371 --> 01:39:43,020
little full of shit because that's our 
work.

2300
01:39:43,110 --> 01:39:46,950
How do you feel a 45 minute TV show with
complete?

2301
01:39:46,950 --> 01:39:47,411
Like,
you know,

2302
01:39:47,411 --> 01:39:49,440
just peer reviewed science everyday.
It's hard.

2303
01:39:49,470 --> 01:39:50,303
So like,
so you start bullshitting and we're way 

2304
01:39:52,411 --> 01:39:56,670
more than that.
That's like shilling for selling miracle

2305
01:39:56,671 --> 01:40:00,720
Cube is so fucked and it's like the 
disappointing thing is like he was.

2306
01:40:01,200 --> 01:40:02,033
I mean when I say good,
he was an amazingly good cardiothoracic 

2307
01:40:04,771 --> 01:40:05,604
surgeon and that's what's disappointing 
about this is he used that credibility 

2308
01:40:09,210 --> 01:40:13,050
of being such a good doctor to be such a
big asshole.

2309
01:40:13,110 --> 01:40:14,520
It's like,
why?

2310
01:40:14,550 --> 01:40:16,950
Why would you do that to people they 
expect we,

2311
01:40:17,150 --> 01:40:19,680
we wanted better from you just don't do 
that.

2312
01:40:19,710 --> 01:40:20,543
Ben Carson,
the guy who's like a serious 

2313
01:40:22,140 --> 01:40:25,740
neurosurgeon,
he was at anything to earth 10,000 years

2314
01:40:25,741 --> 01:40:26,574
old.
He thinks there's grain in the fucking 

2315
01:40:27,541 --> 01:40:29,550
pyramids,
grain grain.

2316
01:40:29,610 --> 01:40:30,421
He was like,
there's great.

2317
01:40:30,421 --> 01:40:31,254
And in the pyramids that's not so 
shocking that someone would leave some 

2318
01:40:37,291 --> 01:40:42,200
grain behind but not like filled with 
grains.

2319
01:40:42,280 --> 01:40:45,270
I think he thought they were silos.
They were ancient silos.

2320
01:40:45,300 --> 01:40:46,133
Like it's not that he doesn't mean that 
there's like an occasional vase full of 

2321
01:40:49,171 --> 01:40:51,450
grain.
He means like they were silos and that's

2322
01:40:51,451 --> 01:40:54,830
not not accurate.
Were a young earth or it's I.

2323
01:40:55,540 --> 01:40:56,670
That might be.
I don't,

2324
01:40:56,680 --> 01:40:59,050
I haven't looked too much into them.
I might've made that up,

2325
01:41:00,040 --> 01:41:00,873
but I mean it would,
nothing would surprise me with some of 

2326
01:41:02,411 --> 01:41:03,244
the people.
There are a lot of people who are 

2327
01:41:04,151 --> 01:41:04,984
extremely smart,
but they close off just giant sections 

2328
01:41:07,361 --> 01:41:08,194
of their reasoning and understand that 
it's hard to find people that are a 

2329
01:41:10,861 --> 01:41:11,900
hundred percent,
you know,

2330
01:41:12,030 --> 01:41:14,380
are very skeptical and very,
uh,

2331
01:41:14,381 --> 01:41:15,190
you know,
or,

2332
01:41:15,190 --> 01:41:18,750
or critical thinkers and want to be 
critical thinkers in every field.

2333
01:41:18,910 --> 01:41:19,541
I feel like,
look,

2334
01:41:19,541 --> 01:41:20,374
I have this spool.
I'll be really good and really critical 

2335
01:41:21,911 --> 01:41:24,220
thinking about this,
but motherfucker,

2336
01:41:24,221 --> 01:41:26,320
I have this belief and you can't touch 
it.

2337
01:41:26,320 --> 01:41:28,750
And like that seems to be the case with 
a lot of people.

2338
01:41:28,751 --> 01:41:30,520
I'm like,
I just want evidence about things.

2339
01:41:30,521 --> 01:41:31,354
Show me evidence.
And the big thing is show me where the 

2340
01:41:33,131 --> 01:41:33,964
balance of evidence says,
like if you give me two articles that 

2341
01:41:36,401 --> 01:41:39,220
say this and then 10,000 that say this,
I'm like,

2342
01:41:39,221 --> 01:41:40,690
I'm over here.
I'm going there.

2343
01:41:40,691 --> 01:41:42,770
And I think that's.
I think that's kind of a,

2344
01:41:42,790 --> 01:41:45,490
a solid way to,
to evaluate evidence.

2345
01:41:45,491 --> 01:41:48,820
Like if you've got a lot of them that 
say this and they're.

2346
01:41:49,020 --> 01:41:49,853
And they seem solid and backed by a 
backed by people who know what they're 

2347
01:41:53,111 --> 01:41:54,890
talking about.
It just seems to be the,

2348
01:41:55,000 --> 01:41:57,770
a good way to evaluate what you're,
you know,

2349
01:41:57,900 --> 01:42:00,730
how you're gonna choose your opinions on
something.

2350
01:42:01,240 --> 01:42:02,073
It seems like you just really have to do
a lot of research before you form any 

2351
01:42:04,571 --> 01:42:05,530
opinion on anything.

2352
01:42:05,550 --> 01:42:06,383
And it's like,
well that's one of the reasons why I 

2353
01:42:07,301 --> 01:42:11,760
don't blame people when they don't get 
it right right away because I do like.

2354
01:42:11,770 --> 01:42:13,700
And this is something I'll do it.
Some of my talks a lot,

2355
01:42:13,750 --> 01:42:14,381
I'll say,
you know,

2356
01:42:14,381 --> 01:42:18,320
take out your phones and Google a term 
that you're not sure about in,

2357
01:42:18,321 --> 01:42:19,570
in health or nutrition,
google,

2358
01:42:19,571 --> 01:42:20,420
gmos,
google,

2359
01:42:20,421 --> 01:42:21,430
sugar,
Google,

2360
01:42:21,600 --> 01:42:22,433
you know,
whatever.

2361
01:42:22,480 --> 01:42:23,313
And you know,
tell me what the top 10 search results 

2362
01:42:24,911 --> 01:42:26,500
say.
And you know,

2363
01:42:26,560 --> 01:42:29,830
sometimes like,
especially with Gmos for a long time,

2364
01:42:29,831 --> 01:42:31,960
the top like eight out of 10 search 
results were like,

2365
01:42:31,961 --> 01:42:32,794
wow,
this is going to make your Dick fall 

2366
01:42:33,761 --> 01:42:34,594
off.
And it's like now like it's changed a 

2367
01:42:36,161 --> 01:42:36,994
little bit because there's been a huge 
effort by science writers to get other 

2368
01:42:39,430 --> 01:42:41,770
words.
This isn't gonna kill you,

2369
01:42:42,190 --> 01:42:43,600
but like for,
for awhile,

2370
01:42:43,690 --> 01:42:44,700
like how,
you know,

2371
01:42:44,740 --> 01:42:48,070
it's so many of the top search results.
So they were horrible.

2372
01:42:48,520 --> 01:42:49,900
How hard should,
you know,

2373
01:42:49,901 --> 01:42:50,734
just a soccer mom in Iowa have to hunt 
to figure out if this is going to kill 

2374
01:42:53,441 --> 01:42:54,420
her kids.
Like and I,

2375
01:42:54,580 --> 01:42:55,413
that's why I really don't blame people 
when they get it wrong at first because 

2376
01:42:58,031 --> 01:42:58,864
this is,
there's so much bad information out 

2377
01:43:00,431 --> 01:43:02,620
there that it's easy to get the 
impression that,

2378
01:43:02,621 --> 01:43:03,454
like I said,
the 10,000 articles say it's bad when 

2379
01:43:05,381 --> 01:43:06,790
it's really just,
you know,

2380
01:43:06,850 --> 01:43:09,670
screaming assholes repeating,
you know,

2381
01:43:09,671 --> 01:43:11,380
the one article that say it's bad.

2382
01:43:11,630 --> 01:43:14,180
Well if you just google chiropractic 
medicine,

2383
01:43:14,181 --> 01:43:16,280
you're not gonna get a lot of fraud 
articles.

2384
01:43:16,640 --> 01:43:17,473
If you Google Chiropractic is bullshit,
you get your article and then you go 

2385
01:43:20,271 --> 01:43:23,870
down a rabbit hole and you know,
if you Google chiropractic fraud,

2386
01:43:23,871 --> 01:43:24,704
you'll find plenty of stuff on it.
And then the history of chiropractic 

2387
01:43:27,891 --> 01:43:30,610
medicine is where really unravels and 
it's,

2388
01:43:30,620 --> 01:43:31,453
it's hard to.
It's like when someone just wants to 

2389
01:43:33,351 --> 01:43:36,190
know what's going to fix my back.
Like that's not where they started.

2390
01:43:36,191 --> 01:43:37,750
Right?
Well and that's a problem,

2391
01:43:37,751 --> 01:43:38,584
right?
I mean to back problems are fucking 

2392
01:43:40,190 --> 01:43:41,023
horrible.
I mean that is a part of the problem is 

2393
01:43:43,220 --> 01:43:46,220
people get desperate.
They do not know what to do.

2394
01:43:46,490 --> 01:43:47,323
Just like when you were saying you were 
getting those horrible headaches and 

2395
01:43:48,711 --> 01:43:49,970
you're like,
I'll fucking try anything.

2396
01:43:50,510 --> 01:43:52,520
I'm going to go.
I'm going to go GMO

2397
01:43:52,520 --> 01:43:54,980
free.
I'm going to drink water only.

2398
01:43:54,981 --> 01:43:56,270
I'm going to.
Yeah.

2399
01:43:56,480 --> 01:43:59,360
I gave up my beloved Diet Coke Dark 
Times.

2400
01:43:59,361 --> 01:44:00,194
You get worried,
you get worried and you start thinking 

2401
01:44:02,391 --> 01:44:03,224
about different ways that you can.
And then if someone comes along and 

2402
01:44:04,971 --> 01:44:05,661
says,
look,

2403
01:44:05,661 --> 01:44:07,430
this is the solution.
Just stick with it.

2404
01:44:07,431 --> 01:44:10,430
I need to see you twice a week.
This one guy that I was going to,

2405
01:44:10,431 --> 01:44:11,570
it was like,
you got to come more often,

2406
01:44:11,571 --> 01:44:13,420
buddy.
That's really the way I go.

2407
01:44:13,421 --> 01:44:16,230
I've got to get you to move my neck more
often.

2408
01:44:16,870 --> 01:44:19,160
The fuck are you doing really?
You know?

2409
01:44:19,161 --> 01:44:22,310
And I stopped going to him.
I was going to this one guy and he had a

2410
01:44:22,311 --> 01:44:25,100
really good massage therapist and I was 
getting a massage therapy.

2411
01:44:25,101 --> 01:44:28,280
Then I stopped getting the chiropractic 
adjustment and then he was like,

2412
01:44:28,281 --> 01:44:30,080
look,
you gotta you gotta get the chiropractic

2413
01:44:30,081 --> 01:44:31,050
adjustment too,
and I was like,

2414
01:44:32,100 --> 01:44:32,720
I'm kidding.

2415
01:44:32,720 --> 01:44:34,820
One thing is helping me.
The other thing,

2416
01:44:34,821 --> 01:44:36,230
I don't feel anything.
I just.

2417
01:44:36,380 --> 01:44:39,290
It sounds cool.
I like the sound was like pop,

2418
01:44:39,291 --> 01:44:41,630
pop that crick feels cool.
It feels good.

2419
01:44:41,631 --> 01:44:44,000
Like when you do this,
that feels good,

2420
01:44:44,150 --> 01:44:47,030
but that's the same fucking thing that a
chiropractor is doing to you.

2421
01:44:47,180 --> 01:44:49,880
But then they tell you not supposed to 
do that to your fingers.

2422
01:44:50,420 --> 01:44:50,901
I'm like,
well,

2423
01:44:50,901 --> 01:44:51,501
why?
Well,

2424
01:44:51,501 --> 01:44:52,580
it can cause arthritis.
Oh,

2425
01:44:52,581 --> 01:44:55,940
how the fuck do you know how many I've 
been doing it my whole life.

2426
01:44:55,941 --> 01:44:57,610
I don't have arthritis.
Well,

2427
01:44:57,710 --> 01:44:58,543
the question is kind of like we're 
talking about with longterm pesticide 

2428
01:45:00,441 --> 01:45:01,274
exposure.
I don't know where that's gonna land me 

2429
01:45:02,871 --> 01:45:04,570
when I'm 70.
I believe it.

2430
01:45:04,870 --> 01:45:05,703
That causes arthritis 70.
They're just going to throw some new 

2431
01:45:07,941 --> 01:45:08,774
touareg at me and it will be fine.
Point was that you can't have it both 

2432
01:45:11,511 --> 01:45:11,930
ways.

2433
01:45:11,930 --> 01:45:14,900
If this causes arthritis,
how the fuck are you allowed to crack my

2434
01:45:14,901 --> 01:45:17,360
neck all the time?
That's an excellent points.

2435
01:45:17,420 --> 01:45:17,691
Like,
well,

2436
01:45:17,691 --> 01:45:19,190
it's one or the other.
It's funny.

2437
01:45:19,191 --> 01:45:20,220
I've had um,
one person.

2438
01:45:20,221 --> 01:45:21,054
It's funny for all the people who 
messaged me because you asked what the 

2439
01:45:22,880 --> 01:45:24,170
feedback was.
It wasn't just,

2440
01:45:24,171 --> 01:45:25,970
you know,
chiropractors who would really mad.

2441
01:45:26,240 --> 01:45:30,470
I had some people say my parents brought
me for Chiropractic when I was a kid and

2442
01:45:30,471 --> 01:45:32,630
now my back is fucked up.
So I mean,

2443
01:45:32,740 --> 01:45:36,710
and I don't know how many stories there 
are like that from people saying,

2444
01:45:36,920 --> 01:45:37,753
you know,
we started chiropractic when I was a 

2445
01:45:38,511 --> 01:45:41,480
baby and this was not the way to go for 
me,

2446
01:45:41,970 --> 01:45:42,803
but God,
some of the responses to the article be 

2447
01:45:44,450 --> 01:45:45,730
Jesus fucking Christ.
Well,

2448
01:45:45,830 --> 01:45:46,663
what does that woman who just died,
the playboy model or assuming the 

2449
01:45:49,941 --> 01:45:52,850
chiropractor there are like the sudden 
very,

2450
01:45:52,851 --> 01:45:54,080
you know,
kind of violent,

2451
01:45:54,100 --> 01:45:58,370
a way that they crack a neck and 
chiropractic can leave you open to,

2452
01:45:58,700 --> 01:46:00,980
to severing an artery in your neck.

2453
01:46:00,980 --> 01:46:01,813
Now it's not often that it happens,
but it happens and this is one of those 

2454
01:46:05,061 --> 01:46:05,894
things that I have a really big 
contention with chiropractic with is 

2455
01:46:08,091 --> 01:46:08,924
that they have all these mornings about 
how western medicine and it's kind of 

2456
01:46:12,081 --> 01:46:12,914
funny that they call it Western medicine
when chiropractic started in the middle 

2457
01:46:15,290 --> 01:46:16,590
of the,
of the US.

2458
01:46:16,820 --> 01:46:17,653
Um,
it's like you don't get to claim that 

2459
01:46:18,321 --> 01:46:20,960
you made this in China for fuck sakes,
but like they'll,

2460
01:46:20,961 --> 01:46:21,794
they'll say that western medicine is so 
horrible for you and it has all these 

2461
01:46:23,841 --> 01:46:26,570
potential side effects and yeah,
it has potential side effects,

2462
01:46:26,720 --> 01:46:30,080
but they have potential side effects 
while they actually cure shit.

2463
01:46:30,081 --> 01:46:33,050
You have potential side effects while 
you're cracking someone's neck.

2464
01:46:33,350 --> 01:46:34,183
Like the potential side effects too.
You're talking about 320 million people 

2465
01:46:39,350 --> 01:46:40,183
that are going to the doctor.
If you have 100,000 cases of potential 

2466
01:46:43,131 --> 01:46:45,650
side effects across the board from all 
causes,

2467
01:46:46,010 --> 01:46:46,843
that's what they're harping on her 
harping on the minority of things that 

2468
01:46:49,861 --> 01:46:50,190
happen

2469
01:46:50,190 --> 01:46:51,480
and go wrong.
And then,

2470
01:46:51,530 --> 01:46:52,363
you know,
obviously there's some shit like 

2471
01:46:53,491 --> 01:46:56,630
thalidomide and some stuff that people 
don't use anymore that are horrible.

2472
01:46:56,631 --> 01:46:57,464
And the side effects,

2473
01:46:57,540 --> 01:46:59,360
what am.
I never made it to the US.

2474
01:47:00,020 --> 01:47:02,180
That's something a lot of people don't 
realize really.

2475
01:47:02,181 --> 01:47:03,920
It was used in other countries,
other countries.

2476
01:47:03,921 --> 01:47:04,754
Now we had one regulator in the US who 
saw the drug was coming up for approval 

2477
01:47:07,911 --> 01:47:09,410
here and she said,
no,

2478
01:47:09,411 --> 01:47:12,800
we have to look into this more.
And then they saw the cases in Europe,

2479
01:47:13,080 --> 01:47:13,913
uh,
of all these infants that were being 

2480
01:47:15,230 --> 01:47:18,170
born with major side effects.
And she was like,

2481
01:47:18,180 --> 01:47:19,011
Ah,
told Ya.

2482
01:47:19,011 --> 01:47:20,750
So that was,
that was how they started.

2483
01:47:20,751 --> 01:47:23,600
And this was what,
this is actually what gave us a,

2484
01:47:23,660 --> 01:47:24,960
one of the best,
uh,

2485
01:47:25,100 --> 01:47:28,530
acts for regulation,
for safety and efficacy in the u.

2486
01:47:28,531 --> 01:47:29,364
s and basically it said that drugs 
before they make it to market now have 

2487
01:47:31,611 --> 01:47:32,444
to be proven beyond a certain amount to 
show that they are both safe and 

2488
01:47:36,861 --> 01:47:37,694
effective.
And it was basically thalidomide that 

2489
01:47:39,530 --> 01:47:41,130
launched that,
uh,

2490
01:47:41,150 --> 01:47:42,560
that act,
which is,

2491
01:47:42,620 --> 01:47:45,380
which is kind of like we're good at 
learning from our mistakes.

2492
01:47:45,650 --> 01:47:46,500
Uh,
in,

2493
01:47:46,560 --> 01:47:47,600
in far I say we,
like,

2494
01:47:47,601 --> 01:47:48,440
I work for it,
but no,

2495
01:47:48,441 --> 01:47:49,160
it's like,
you know,

2496
01:47:49,160 --> 01:47:51,620
we're good at learning from our mistakes
when we have a fuck up like that.

2497
01:47:51,621 --> 01:47:54,590
So I mean,
I don't know what and what worries me is

2498
01:47:54,591 --> 01:47:55,424
that we're going to have eventually 
another way we can very easily have 

2499
01:47:58,941 --> 01:48:02,180
another drug like that,
but it will be something that we haven't

2500
01:48:02,181 --> 01:48:05,720
regulated out of the system yet.
So I don't know what the next thing will

2501
01:48:05,721 --> 01:48:06,554
be,
but it'll be something that we haven't 

2502
01:48:07,971 --> 01:48:10,670
seen yet.
So that's the,

2503
01:48:10,910 --> 01:48:13,430
that that's the kind of a scary thing.
It'll be,

2504
01:48:13,431 --> 01:48:16,490
it'll be like we already know to test 
for things in utero.

2505
01:48:16,491 --> 01:48:18,750
We already noticed the tests for things 
that uh,

2506
01:48:18,820 --> 01:48:20,000
you know,
that can cause cancer.

2507
01:48:20,001 --> 01:48:23,060
We already know certain types of testing
a like,

2508
01:48:23,110 --> 01:48:26,690
but the little mermaid,
it was so crazy nontoxic.

2509
01:48:26,720 --> 01:48:29,840
They couldn't get it to kill a rat.
How nutty is that?

2510
01:48:29,930 --> 01:48:31,600
It was pretty crazy.
When did the babies?

2511
01:48:31,650 --> 01:48:32,310
Uh,
yeah,

2512
01:48:32,310 --> 01:48:33,920
I mean it's,
it's crazy that something that was,

2513
01:48:33,921 --> 01:48:36,800
that was the purpose of it.
It was,

2514
01:48:36,830 --> 01:48:37,663
it was used for a lot of different 
things and the thing that they gave it 

2515
01:48:39,771 --> 01:48:40,604
to mothers for was to stop a morning 
sickness that would still used in a few 

2516
01:48:44,931 --> 01:48:45,764
treatments,
just don't get it anywhere near a 

2517
01:48:47,721 --> 01:48:48,940
pregnant woman.
So the,

2518
01:48:48,980 --> 01:48:50,450
they gave it,
it was really,

2519
01:48:50,451 --> 01:48:51,284
really good for learning or phrase it,
it was really effective at stopping 

2520
01:48:55,551 --> 01:48:56,384
morning sickness,
but just nobody had a clue that it was 

2521
01:48:58,790 --> 01:49:00,380
what it was causing to,
you know,

2522
01:49:00,381 --> 01:49:01,910
in Utero,
um,

2523
01:49:02,420 --> 01:49:03,253
and it was causing limbs to not be 
formed and it was causing all these 

2524
01:49:06,291 --> 01:49:07,124
crazy things and tens of thousands of 
babies were born deformed before they 

2525
01:49:10,041 --> 01:49:10,701
went.
Yikes.

2526
01:49:10,701 --> 01:49:11,400
Pull the plug.

2527
01:49:11,400 --> 01:49:14,640
Isn't there also an issue with approving
drugs isn't,

2528
01:49:14,641 --> 01:49:17,280
isn't there an also an issue with 
biodiversity and that like,

2529
01:49:17,281 --> 01:49:19,710
you have issues that I don't have.
And so there's,

2530
01:49:19,711 --> 01:49:23,040
there's gonna be things that affect you 
that are not going to affect me and vice

2531
01:49:23,041 --> 01:49:23,470
verse.

2532
01:49:23,470 --> 01:49:24,940
And this is why after,
and this is,

2533
01:49:24,970 --> 01:49:26,050
uh,
an interesting that happens.

2534
01:49:26,051 --> 01:49:27,270
So it's,
you know,

2535
01:49:27,280 --> 01:49:27,940
as you,
uh,

2536
01:49:27,940 --> 01:49:28,870
happened with,
uh,

2537
01:49:28,900 --> 01:49:31,900
with your neurotrauma nootropics.
Nootropics.

2538
01:49:31,901 --> 01:49:32,290
Okay.
Sorry,

2539
01:49:32,290 --> 01:49:33,650
my apologies.
So a,

2540
01:49:33,651 --> 01:49:34,484
um,
so with a w so you know about a phase 

2541
01:49:36,941 --> 01:49:39,250
three clinical trials and all that from,
from that,

2542
01:49:39,580 --> 01:49:41,380
um,
so when you get to phase three,

2543
01:49:41,381 --> 01:49:42,214
generally you're testing between three 
and 10,000 people in the population and 

2544
01:49:45,221 --> 01:49:46,630
you've gotten through a few trials,
you know,

2545
01:49:46,631 --> 01:49:47,464
that this effective for this,
you want to see if people have you're 

2546
01:49:49,751 --> 01:49:53,470
testing for allergic reactions in your 
testing to see where people are going to

2547
01:49:53,471 --> 01:49:56,470
have issues with the drug so that when 
you get to market,

2548
01:49:56,680 --> 01:49:58,390
you know that,
you know,

2549
01:49:58,391 --> 01:49:59,224
these people,
like this is the percentage of people 

2550
01:50:00,281 --> 01:50:02,680
that have these side effects as a 
percentage with these.

2551
01:50:02,890 --> 01:50:04,930
If you have these side effects,
call your doctor right away.

2552
01:50:04,930 --> 01:50:08,560
Just continued that type of stuff.
But that's three to 10,000 people.

2553
01:50:08,680 --> 01:50:10,030
You don't know who you're going to give 
it to.

2554
01:50:10,031 --> 01:50:10,864
That's on x medication that has x 
disorder on top of the thing you're 

2555
01:50:14,471 --> 01:50:16,430
treating for that type of stuff.
Um,

2556
01:50:16,450 --> 01:50:19,630
or if it could cause someone to die,
these things can happen.

2557
01:50:19,631 --> 01:50:20,464
And like,
that's kind of what happened with Vioxx 

2558
01:50:22,180 --> 01:50:23,200
is that,
you know,

2559
01:50:23,430 --> 01:50:24,310
they didn't,
they,

2560
01:50:24,400 --> 01:50:25,233
there were some people in that room who 
probably strokes and some folks it was 

2561
01:50:30,950 --> 01:50:34,670
arthritis medication and it was like he 
got a stroke from that part.

2562
01:50:34,690 --> 01:50:36,110
Oh Wow.
Holy Shit.

2563
01:50:36,111 --> 01:50:36,810
And I mean,
there were,

2564
01:50:36,810 --> 01:50:40,120
there were people in that room who 
probably look at it and said,

2565
01:50:40,121 --> 01:50:41,860
all right,
so there's this risk factor,

2566
01:50:42,050 --> 01:50:42,670
uh,
that's,

2567
01:50:42,670 --> 01:50:46,030
that causes you to increase your 
possible risk factor by x percent.

2568
01:50:46,240 --> 01:50:49,120
What if somebody has all of these risk 
factors combined?

2569
01:50:49,370 --> 01:50:50,320
Uh,
and you know,

2570
01:50:50,321 --> 01:50:51,154
like,
well you shouldn't approve it because 

2571
01:50:51,971 --> 01:50:52,804
there's a chance if you put it on 
somebody on this who has all of these 

2572
01:50:54,851 --> 01:50:55,930
combined,
it's,

2573
01:50:55,980 --> 01:50:56,813
there's a chance that they're gonna have
their chances of getting a stroke is or 

2574
01:50:59,620 --> 01:51:00,960
you know,
having an issue with their heart.

2575
01:51:01,000 --> 01:51:03,880
What is it harder tech firm it is going 
to be through the roof.

2576
01:51:03,881 --> 01:51:06,310
We shouldn't approve it.
And it got approved anyway.

2577
01:51:06,311 --> 01:51:09,920
And it's one of those drugs that 
shouldn't have been put through a lot of

2578
01:51:10,140 --> 01:51:12,730
was heart attacks,
stroke from it.

2579
01:51:12,770 --> 01:51:14,080
Oh,
it's a blood clot.

2580
01:51:14,110 --> 01:51:15,700
That must have been blood clots,
but yeah,

2581
01:51:15,701 --> 01:51:18,290
it's like it's just been significant 
issues with some folks.

2582
01:51:18,291 --> 01:51:20,500
Yeah,
and it's like there is a chance when you

2583
01:51:20,501 --> 01:51:23,800
put any drug through now they try to get
through things to minimize this,

2584
01:51:24,010 --> 01:51:28,300
but because a phase three trial only 
test in,

2585
01:51:28,301 --> 01:51:29,770
you know,
a certain amount of the population,

2586
01:51:29,771 --> 01:51:32,260
they try to get a diverse group when you
get it out,

2587
01:51:32,500 --> 01:51:36,070
you don't know what the possible effects
are going to be on someone else.

2588
01:51:36,070 --> 01:51:36,903
So you might see new side effects 
depending on the other drugs someone is 

2589
01:51:40,230 --> 01:51:41,063
onto because you know,
you're not prescribing these to healthy 

2590
01:51:42,311 --> 01:51:43,144
people,
you're prescribing this to a sick 

2591
01:51:44,261 --> 01:51:45,100
person.
So yeah,

2592
01:51:45,101 --> 01:51:46,480
that,
that definitely can happen.

2593
01:51:46,481 --> 01:51:49,000
So that's my first certain amount of 
time after drugs on the market.

2594
01:51:49,180 --> 01:51:53,530
They do post a lot is kind of phase four
clinical trials.

2595
01:51:53,531 --> 01:51:54,364
You're doing a postmarket monitoring,
so that does go on for a certain amount 

2596
01:51:57,581 --> 01:52:01,540
of time and sometimes drugs are pulled 
based on the amount of side effects.

2597
01:52:01,541 --> 01:52:03,340
The other things,
and that doesn't happen often,

2598
01:52:03,940 --> 01:52:07,000
but it can happen based upon,
you know,

2599
01:52:07,001 --> 01:52:10,000
the amount of issues that you see after 
it hits market.

2600
01:52:10,220 --> 01:52:14,350
What are your thoughts about advertising
drugs on television?

2601
01:52:14,351 --> 01:52:18,460
Like a ask your doctor about this,
your doctor.

2602
01:52:18,580 --> 01:52:19,390
It's,
I have,

2603
01:52:19,390 --> 01:52:20,223
I would say mixed feelings,
but most of my feelings are that it's a 

2604
01:52:22,331 --> 01:52:23,260
bad thing.

2605
01:52:23,280 --> 01:52:24,113
Um,
and it's the only good thing I see from 

2606
01:52:26,081 --> 01:52:28,150
it and I mean most of my feelings about 
are still,

2607
01:52:28,151 --> 01:52:28,984
if it's a bad idea,
the only good thing I see about it is 

2608
01:52:31,301 --> 01:52:33,060
that if you have a,
um,

2609
01:52:33,390 --> 01:52:36,610
a,
a patient that's got a shitty disease to

2610
01:52:36,800 --> 01:52:37,633
work with,
they get aware that there's a new 

2611
01:52:39,611 --> 01:52:41,080
medication to treat it,
but you know,

2612
01:52:41,081 --> 01:52:42,780
where they should be getting that 
information there.

2613
01:52:42,790 --> 01:52:44,920
Dr. Exactly.
So ask your doctor,

2614
01:52:45,660 --> 01:52:47,420
maybe maybe you know what your doctor 
is,

2615
01:52:47,421 --> 01:52:49,410
if you're asking them a drug dealer.
Well,

2616
01:52:49,411 --> 01:52:53,150
the problem is when they show these 
people holding hands and spinning around

2617
01:52:53,151 --> 01:52:53,984
in a field of wheat and having the 
greatest time in their life and 

2618
01:52:55,701 --> 01:52:59,000
butterflies are flying around and 
puppies are magnetically drawn to them.

2619
01:52:59,310 --> 01:53:00,143
Enough drugs for that.
So that's the problem is like they have 

2620
01:53:02,901 --> 01:53:05,480
beautiful music playing there are 
manipulating you.

2621
01:53:06,100 --> 01:53:06,761
Like and it's,
I,

2622
01:53:06,761 --> 01:53:08,850
I don't,
I don't feel like that's like,

2623
01:53:08,870 --> 01:53:09,770
no,
it's not appropriate.

2624
01:53:11,000 --> 01:53:14,820
I lived in England for a year and when I
was over there I realized I'm like,

2625
01:53:15,120 --> 01:53:17,660
I'm like,
where were all the drug advertisements?

2626
01:53:17,661 --> 01:53:20,240
Like this is not a thing out here.

2627
01:53:22,350 --> 01:53:24,020
It's an amazing.
It's free,

2628
01:53:24,021 --> 01:53:25,000
it's different.
It was,

2629
01:53:25,020 --> 01:53:25,853
it was.
There are some things that were kind of 

2630
01:53:26,721 --> 01:53:27,560
crazy about that.
I like,

2631
01:53:27,561 --> 01:53:31,010
I landed in the hospital overnight once 
when I was there and I was so like,

2632
01:53:31,140 --> 01:53:33,160
I know you already knew that I had no 
copays.

2633
01:53:33,170 --> 01:53:34,940
When I went to a doctor,
I'm like,

2634
01:53:34,970 --> 01:53:36,800
I'm in the hospital overnight.
Fuck fuck,

2635
01:53:36,801 --> 01:53:37,161
fuck,
fuck,

2636
01:53:37,161 --> 01:53:38,260
fuck.
I'm to like,

2637
01:53:38,270 --> 01:53:42,800
this is going to cost me 10 grand.
When I left they were like,

2638
01:53:42,830 --> 01:53:44,210
did you take a cab here?
I'm like,

2639
01:53:44,270 --> 01:53:44,751
no,
why?

2640
01:53:44,751 --> 01:53:45,231
They're like,
Oh,

2641
01:53:45,231 --> 01:53:46,640
if you had,
we were going to pay for it.

2642
01:53:46,641 --> 01:53:48,110
I'm like,
what,

2643
01:53:48,470 --> 01:53:52,460
who are you people?
This is why I'm an American.

2644
01:53:52,461 --> 01:53:55,640
I don't know what to do with myself.
I'm just going to give us the treatment,

2645
01:53:55,970 --> 01:53:59,170
the treatment rate.
Is it the same over there?

2646
01:53:59,220 --> 01:54:00,053
Because I,
I have friends in Canada and they have 

2647
01:54:02,331 --> 01:54:05,480
massive complaints about the medical 
system in terms of like,

2648
01:54:05,481 --> 01:54:07,730
if you get injured,
it takes a long time.

2649
01:54:08,120 --> 01:54:08,953
All my relatives are,
I have like five relatives in this 

2650
01:54:10,581 --> 01:54:11,414
country.
The rest all live in Nova Scotia and 

2651
01:54:12,650 --> 01:54:14,990
there are,
I'd say it's a mixed bag.

2652
01:54:14,991 --> 01:54:18,920
So if you need urgent care or regular 
care,

2653
01:54:18,921 --> 01:54:20,540
like you need to go to the doctor for a 
checkup,

2654
01:54:20,541 --> 01:54:21,560
you need your,
you know,

2655
01:54:21,561 --> 01:54:23,110
the annuals,
um,

2656
01:54:23,120 --> 01:54:25,520
or you have a fucking heart attack.
You,

2657
01:54:25,521 --> 01:54:28,010
I would say you're better off living in 
Canada.

2658
01:54:28,011 --> 01:54:29,840
Um,
I had a little cousin that was born with

2659
01:54:29,841 --> 01:54:33,650
basically no chambers in her heart,
which is horrifying.

2660
01:54:33,910 --> 01:54:34,340
Uh,
you know,

2661
01:54:34,340 --> 01:54:36,550
it's like they saw it in Utero,
um,

2662
01:54:36,551 --> 01:54:37,384
and it was like,
okay,

2663
01:54:37,820 --> 01:54:38,653
we're going to have to give this child 
and operation like almost immediately 

2664
01:54:40,881 --> 01:54:44,930
when she was born for the next two years
out of surgery,

2665
01:54:44,931 --> 01:54:45,764
almost every like open heart surgery 
every year on the dot of a year as the 

2666
01:54:49,160 --> 01:54:51,380
heart grows.
And it was like we asked,

2667
01:54:51,381 --> 01:54:52,214
you know why?

2668
01:54:52,440 --> 01:54:53,090
Yeah,
it was,

2669
01:54:53,090 --> 01:54:53,923
I mean they couldn't do all the fixing 
because they needed to do it as a heart 

2670
01:54:56,121 --> 01:54:57,980
got bigger.
And what do they do?

2671
01:54:57,981 --> 01:54:59,780
How do they do that?
And I mean,

2672
01:54:59,781 --> 01:55:01,850
I,
I wish I knew all the technicalities,

2673
01:55:01,851 --> 01:55:04,040
but you'd have to talk to a heart 
surgeon chamber.

2674
01:55:04,041 --> 01:55:06,920
So would the heart look like?
I'm not exactly sure.

2675
01:55:06,921 --> 01:55:09,190
I never saw the pictures of it,
but I mean it's a,

2676
01:55:09,230 --> 01:55:10,460
I'll,
I'll hunt down my,

2677
01:55:10,480 --> 01:55:11,271
uh,
her father,

2678
01:55:11,271 --> 01:55:14,060
my cousins,
a blog that documented it if you want to

2679
01:55:14,061 --> 01:55:14,894
have a peak.
But it was a fairly rare condition of 

2680
01:55:16,970 --> 01:55:18,830
the heart was I believe when she was 
born,

2681
01:55:18,831 --> 01:55:20,960
like I was a little closer to the center
of the chest.

2682
01:55:20,961 --> 01:55:22,580
Like it's a,
it was a very,

2683
01:55:22,581 --> 01:55:25,550
like my mom said that when she held her,
when she was first born,

2684
01:55:25,790 --> 01:55:26,623
like the pulsing even felt sounded a 
little different than a normal infant's 

2685
01:55:30,981 --> 01:55:33,620
heart like it was,
but I mean the first,

2686
01:55:33,710 --> 01:55:36,650
at first they did a surgery that kind of
put a band around the heart,

2687
01:55:37,010 --> 01:55:37,843
a to give it a little more structure and
then they formed more chambers and then 

2688
01:55:40,791 --> 01:55:43,500
when she was three,
they put in like full chambers.

2689
01:55:43,500 --> 01:55:46,260
Now she,
the only thing she can't do is she can't

2690
01:55:46,261 --> 01:55:49,170
play contact sports and they paid 
nothing.

2691
01:55:49,800 --> 01:55:54,570
She can't play contact sports because of
possibility of causing,

2692
01:55:54,690 --> 01:55:56,730
um,
I'm not sure exactly what it can do,

2693
01:55:56,731 --> 01:55:57,310
but it's,
you know,

2694
01:55:57,310 --> 01:55:58,143
there's,
it can cause a little bit too much 

2695
01:55:58,651 --> 01:56:01,770
trauma to a heart that's already been 
through a lot of trauma.

2696
01:56:01,860 --> 01:56:03,930
But that's the only thing that she's 
been told not to do.

2697
01:56:04,010 --> 01:56:05,070
Don't kick box.
Yeah.

2698
01:56:05,071 --> 01:56:07,060
No kickboxing,
no good.

2699
01:56:07,190 --> 01:56:08,340
No good.
She can run,

2700
01:56:08,390 --> 01:56:10,080
she can.
I believe she can run,

2701
01:56:10,620 --> 01:56:12,780
she can.
She's happy.

2702
01:56:12,781 --> 01:56:15,120
Active little kid.
Looks really healthy.

2703
01:56:15,121 --> 01:56:16,470
Uh,
is about the same.

2704
01:56:16,500 --> 01:56:17,011
Uh,
she's,

2705
01:56:17,011 --> 01:56:17,844
she's a twin and she's got,
she's about the same height as her 

2706
01:56:19,831 --> 01:56:21,290
brother,
like she's a,

2707
01:56:22,320 --> 01:56:23,153
why didn't they just take her to a 
chiropractor where they could adjust to 

2708
01:56:25,990 --> 01:56:27,690
see if you'd been there to suggest this 
show.

2709
01:56:27,691 --> 01:56:29,460
She'd be fine.
Rub the back of your.

2710
01:56:29,480 --> 01:56:32,970
I went from maybe she never known what a
pal throw stickers.

2711
01:56:33,490 --> 01:56:36,130
One of them things that credit card,
just put it under a feet once you sleep,

2712
01:56:36,131 --> 01:56:36,964
but some energy for her food.
I went to this one motherfucker who is 

2713
01:56:40,441 --> 01:56:44,700
treating a bunch of fighters and he was 
a zone healer.

2714
01:56:44,701 --> 01:56:46,650
Do you know what a zone healers heard of
it?

2715
01:56:46,651 --> 01:56:49,440
But I'm excited now.
Seem like such a nice guy.

2716
01:56:49,500 --> 01:56:51,010
He was a chiropractor too,
he seemed like,

2717
01:56:51,060 --> 01:56:55,560
and it probably is a nice guy,
but he would press the back of your head

2718
01:56:55,860 --> 01:56:58,770
or like little spots and he's like,
does this hurt here?

2719
01:56:58,771 --> 01:57:00,450
Does this hurt here,
does this hurt here?

2720
01:57:00,451 --> 01:57:01,620
And then you press harder.

2721
01:57:01,980 --> 01:57:04,460
And I go,
well that one's Kinda S.

2722
01:57:05,900 --> 01:57:06,733
and he's like,
well there could be an issue with the 

2723
01:57:08,250 --> 01:57:10,320
hypothalamus or some shit like that.
I was like,

2724
01:57:10,321 --> 01:57:12,270
what?
And so you know,

2725
01:57:12,430 --> 01:57:15,300
I'm a pretty skeptical per.
I've been hoodwinked before,

2726
01:57:15,301 --> 01:57:16,134
but I'm pretty skeptical and when I know
that someone's pushing on a part of my 

2727
01:57:20,161 --> 01:57:22,710
head harder,
asking me if that part,

2728
01:57:22,790 --> 01:57:23,623
then claiming that they can tell from 
the fucking skin on the cover on your 

2729
01:57:27,331 --> 01:57:29,340
skull,
this is the skin on your skull.

2730
01:57:29,490 --> 01:57:32,160
Like they can tell like did this is the 
area,

2731
01:57:32,280 --> 01:57:34,950
this is all,
you've got an issue with your liver,

2732
01:57:35,280 --> 01:57:37,170
the liver area.
When I squeezed on pressure on it,

2733
01:57:37,590 --> 01:57:38,670
so it's like,
no,

2734
01:57:38,671 --> 01:57:43,390
this is the liver right there,
so me and this guy get into it and so I,

2735
01:57:43,400 --> 01:57:45,630
I go,
I mean I'm being respectful,

2736
01:57:45,631 --> 01:57:46,890
but I'm like,
what are you doing?

2737
01:57:47,070 --> 01:57:49,110
And he's like,
well this is called zone healing.

2738
01:57:49,140 --> 01:57:51,060
He's explaining this zone healing thing 
to me and I'm like,

2739
01:57:51,061 --> 01:57:51,990
what did you do?
And I'm like,

2740
01:57:51,991 --> 01:57:53,940
well it can cure all these different 
diseases.

2741
01:57:53,941 --> 01:57:54,774
Don't talk to me about all these 
different autoimmune diseases that it 

2742
01:57:57,181 --> 01:57:58,830
can cure and all these different things.
I go,

2743
01:57:58,831 --> 01:57:59,790
well,
how's it working?

2744
01:57:59,791 --> 01:58:00,541
It's like,
well,

2745
01:58:00,541 --> 01:58:01,374
it's just the way that I'm manipulating 
you in a certain way and the with the 

2746
01:58:05,611 --> 01:58:08,180
frequencies and what.
So I'm like,

2747
01:58:08,190 --> 01:58:09,870
come on man,
how the fuck is this working?

2748
01:58:09,871 --> 01:58:11,040
I'm like,
that doesn't make any sense.

2749
01:58:11,041 --> 01:58:14,460
And so then we get to it and he's like,
you understand the placebo effect,

2750
01:58:14,461 --> 01:58:15,091
right?
And I go,

2751
01:58:15,091 --> 01:58:15,924
yeah,
well the placebo effect is you give 

2752
01:58:16,801 --> 01:58:17,634
someone a sugar pill,
you tell them what's medicine and 

2753
01:58:19,291 --> 01:58:21,360
somehow or it magically heels from Ryan.
He's like,

2754
01:58:21,361 --> 01:58:22,530
yeah.
And he's like,

2755
01:58:22,531 --> 01:58:23,770
well,
this is essentially what we do.

2756
01:58:23,771 --> 01:58:24,604
And I go,
so you're bullshitting and you're 

2757
01:58:25,981 --> 01:58:27,780
letting these people's bodies heal 
themselves.

2758
01:58:27,781 --> 01:58:28,920
He goes,
I wouldn't put it that way.

2759
01:58:29,000 --> 01:58:29,833
I,
of course you wouldn't put it that way 

2760
01:58:30,301 --> 01:58:32,000
because you're charging money for this.
Like,

2761
01:58:32,120 --> 01:58:32,953
Lisa,
you're saying that what you're doing 

2762
01:58:33,991 --> 01:58:35,610
doesn't really do anything.
He goes,

2763
01:58:35,611 --> 01:58:36,880
but it does.
I go,

2764
01:58:36,881 --> 01:58:37,980
it does.
He goes,

2765
01:58:37,981 --> 01:58:39,120
if you believe in it,
it does.

2766
01:58:39,650 --> 01:58:42,070
Jesus fucking have to believe

2767
01:58:42,070 --> 01:58:43,480
in penicillin.
Okay.

2768
01:58:43,481 --> 01:58:44,720
Exactly.
But that's.

2769
01:58:44,800 --> 01:58:45,633
It was so disturbing to me because I 
knew a bunch of guys who had gone to 

2770
01:58:47,591 --> 01:58:48,311
them and they're like,
oh,

2771
01:58:48,311 --> 01:58:49,870
this guy is fixing my knee,
and I was like,

2772
01:58:49,871 --> 01:58:50,704
what?
He's fixing your knee by adjusting your 

2773
01:58:52,481 --> 01:58:53,920
neck.
He's fixing your knee.

2774
01:58:53,980 --> 01:58:54,813
He's not fixing your knee.
Your knee is getting healed because 

2775
01:58:56,591 --> 01:58:58,960
you're taking time off.
I just want to heal.

2776
01:58:58,961 --> 01:59:00,520
You know,
the body knows how to heal.

2777
01:59:00,580 --> 01:59:03,430
I want to reflexologist mechanic for my 
car.

2778
01:59:03,431 --> 01:59:06,900
I want someone to start reflexologist.
Same thing as where they were.

2779
01:59:06,930 --> 01:59:09,010
They.
They say that it's not just that they're

2780
01:59:09,040 --> 01:59:09,873
messing with your feet there.
They're giving a reflexology massage 

2781
01:59:11,741 --> 01:59:12,574
where they tap on certain parts of your 
feet and they say it's healing her 

2782
01:59:14,051 --> 01:59:14,884
liver,
so give me a reflexologist mechanic so 

2783
01:59:16,991 --> 01:59:18,790
that they're tapping on my tires and 
it's like,

2784
01:59:18,800 --> 01:59:18,971
no,
no,

2785
01:59:18,971 --> 01:59:20,200
no.
I'm working on your radiator.

2786
01:59:20,201 --> 01:59:21,270
I want to see that.

2787
01:59:21,410 --> 01:59:22,890
Yeah.
I'm not aware of reflexology.

2788
01:59:22,891 --> 01:59:26,850
I've seen those places where they show 
like a chart of the feet and it looks.

2789
01:59:26,960 --> 01:59:29,260
Might as well be a fucking palm reader.
Right?

2790
01:59:29,580 --> 01:59:34,500
You're walking by and they have a one of
those neon signs and so they.

2791
01:59:34,530 --> 01:59:35,220
What do they do?

2792
01:59:35,220 --> 01:59:36,053
They say that by tapping on certain,
like this part the arch is really your 

2793
01:59:38,911 --> 01:59:43,720
liver and your toes are really.
Your arch is your liver or I'm not sure.

2794
01:59:43,721 --> 01:59:46,230
I like,
I'm but like that's the same shit.

2795
01:59:46,320 --> 01:59:47,610
Oh yeah.
But like I said,

2796
01:59:47,611 --> 01:59:49,560
give me,
give me like the Chiropractic,

2797
01:59:49,800 --> 01:59:53,160
a reflexologist of,
of the mechanic world.

2798
01:59:53,161 --> 01:59:57,450
I want them to start tapping on,
on my oil tank and say,

2799
01:59:57,451 --> 01:59:58,980
Oh really?
I'm fixing your alternator.

2800
01:59:58,981 --> 02:00:03,030
Like none of nobody does this shit for 
cars because you know why your car won't

2801
02:00:03,031 --> 02:00:03,864
run.

2802
02:00:04,000 --> 02:00:04,833
There's a real problem with people 
saying they know things that they don't 

2803
02:00:07,571 --> 02:00:08,404
really know and I think people get 
really upset by it and I think it's one 

2804
02:00:11,111 --> 02:00:11,944
of the reasons why it's so important to 
be honest about what you actually know 

2805
02:00:14,121 --> 02:00:15,840
and when you don't actually know.
You know.

2806
02:00:15,850 --> 02:00:16,683
I think that's.
That to me is like the most important 

2807
02:00:18,551 --> 02:00:19,384
currency.
Like you should never give up how you 

2808
02:00:21,611 --> 02:00:25,150
honestly feel and what you honestly 
think and what you honestly know about.

2809
02:00:25,151 --> 02:00:25,984
Something and as soon as,
so as soon as you are a fucking 

2810
02:00:27,611 --> 02:00:32,320
astrologer or a card reader or a palm 
reader or a psychic,

2811
02:00:32,370 --> 02:00:34,950
you're a bullshit artist.
This is you,

2812
02:00:34,951 --> 02:00:35,520
you,
you,

2813
02:00:35,520 --> 02:00:38,830
you're.
The reason you exist is because we can't

2814
02:00:38,831 --> 02:00:39,664
really read minds because if I could 
know that you don't really know that if 

2815
02:00:42,191 --> 02:00:44,260
I could see a little Turkey tests or pop
up on your head,

2816
02:00:44,840 --> 02:00:46,210
well I know you're full of shit.
Like,

2817
02:00:46,211 --> 02:00:47,920
Oh,
you're fucking tester popped up,

2818
02:00:47,921 --> 02:00:48,310
homie.

2819
02:00:48,310 --> 02:00:49,720
Oh yeah.
It's like the way you.

2820
02:00:49,721 --> 02:00:50,554
I think if anyone out there,
because I'm guessing your audience 

2821
02:00:52,751 --> 02:00:55,360
doesn't have a lot of people who believe
in psychics,

2822
02:00:55,361 --> 02:00:56,530
but if anyone should,
they do.

2823
02:00:56,590 --> 02:00:57,423
If anyone out there truly believes in a 
psychic walk into one and when they ask 

2824
02:01:00,281 --> 02:01:02,050
you your name,
just walk right the fuck back out.

2825
02:01:02,051 --> 02:01:04,510
Because if they were a real psychic,
they would know you were coming and they

2826
02:01:04,511 --> 02:01:05,440
would know your name.

2827
02:01:05,670 --> 02:01:07,410
Yeah.
Maybe they weren't paying attention.

2828
02:01:07,830 --> 02:01:09,510
They to check.
See if you're lying.

2829
02:01:09,511 --> 02:01:10,440
If you say,
my name is Fred,

2830
02:01:10,630 --> 02:01:11,041
like,
okay,

2831
02:01:11,041 --> 02:01:11,500
mark,

2832
02:01:11,500 --> 02:01:12,333
so just walk right in.
Walk right in and give them a false 

2833
02:01:15,041 --> 02:01:16,240
story and see if they check it.

2834
02:01:16,800 --> 02:01:18,530
I have a friend who went to a psychic 
and he was like,

2835
02:01:18,531 --> 02:01:20,270
dude,
this guy knew all about my grandma.

2836
02:01:20,271 --> 02:01:22,340
I'm like,
don't you know about your grandma?

2837
02:01:23,830 --> 02:01:25,190
Fuck,
are you talking about man?

2838
02:01:25,350 --> 02:01:26,183
She was.
She was an old lady and she was grandma 

2839
02:01:27,601 --> 02:01:29,070
like.
And she coached things that you like.

2840
02:01:29,080 --> 02:01:30,630
See,
I know about your grandma too.

2841
02:01:30,631 --> 02:01:31,260
Motherfucker

2842
02:01:31,260 --> 02:01:32,093
will they give you,
they give you these leading questions 

2843
02:01:34,501 --> 02:01:37,230
and then you give them information.
They're really good at reading.

2844
02:01:37,590 --> 02:01:38,870
Banner check is.
Oh yeah.

2845
02:01:39,260 --> 02:01:40,070
I'm friends with the

2846
02:01:40,070 --> 02:01:42,940
Penn and teller.
I love those guys there.

2847
02:01:42,950 --> 02:01:44,720
It's,
it's funny guys.

2848
02:01:44,721 --> 02:01:47,330
I learned a lot of my writing style kind
of from that and there was,

2849
02:01:47,331 --> 02:01:48,164
it was funny,
there was a night a backstage after the 

2850
02:01:50,091 --> 02:01:52,520
show once where I was talking about like
what I was doing with,

2851
02:01:52,521 --> 02:01:55,160
uh,
with the writing with teller.

2852
02:01:55,460 --> 02:01:56,293
And one of the things he said it was 
about getting the script back for the 

2853
02:01:59,211 --> 02:02:00,044
chiropractic episode and they have to be
really careful with how they wrote the 

2854
02:02:03,201 --> 02:02:06,120
episodes of bullshit bullshit.
Oh yeah,

2855
02:02:06,280 --> 02:02:08,980
great show.
And it was funny because like I,

2856
02:02:09,160 --> 02:02:09,993
I turned into a skeptic from watching 
that show and it was just great because 

2857
02:02:15,441 --> 02:02:15,741
like,
I,

2858
02:02:15,741 --> 02:02:16,574
you know,
obviously I'd never heard her talk 

2859
02:02:17,631 --> 02:02:21,020
before I got to know that group and it 
was like that was,

2860
02:02:21,050 --> 02:02:22,850
that was the first time because I Chit 
chatted with,

2861
02:02:22,851 --> 02:02:23,684
tell her a little bit before because I 
got to know penn first and hearing 

2862
02:02:27,000 --> 02:02:27,833
teller describe,
like after I started doing the sybase 

2863
02:02:29,960 --> 02:02:32,720
thing,
I'm chatting with him about that.

2864
02:02:32,720 --> 02:02:34,550
I got a little insight into his brain.
He's like,

2865
02:02:34,820 --> 02:02:35,653
yeah,
we got the script back from legal and 

2866
02:02:36,981 --> 02:02:39,620
they said just call the chiropractor's 
motherfuckers.

2867
02:02:41,590 --> 02:02:42,860
I'm like,
inside.

2868
02:02:42,861 --> 02:02:44,360
I'm like,
I gotta keep my composition,

2869
02:02:44,361 --> 02:02:45,194
but my lord,
that was like hearing teller say mother 

2870
02:02:47,251 --> 02:02:48,084
fuckers.
Oh,

2871
02:02:48,650 --> 02:02:51,770
that sounds like something penn would 
say takes these motherfuckers.

2872
02:02:51,800 --> 02:02:54,140
It's,
there's basically everything you hear in

2873
02:02:54,141 --> 02:02:54,861
pens,
tone of voice.

2874
02:02:54,861 --> 02:02:57,710
You have to hear it in this tone of 
voice.

2875
02:02:57,750 --> 02:02:58,583
Like I've learned a lot about.
I've learned a lot about skeptic being 

2876
02:03:03,620 --> 02:03:04,453
responsibly from him.
And one of the things I've always taken 

2877
02:03:05,961 --> 02:03:08,160
away is don't blame the victim.
Uh,

2878
02:03:08,210 --> 02:03:09,043
and that's,
that's something that I've kept with me 

2879
02:03:09,981 --> 02:03:11,220
and I'll always keep with me.
It's,

2880
02:03:11,240 --> 02:03:13,970
he's a,
he's been a big influence on my work and

2881
02:03:13,971 --> 02:03:15,380
it's been,
it's been helpful.

2882
02:03:15,790 --> 02:03:17,740
Yeah,
I mean we've all been hoodwinked,

2883
02:03:17,820 --> 02:03:18,653
mean at some stage of your life,
whether it's your parents telling you 

2884
02:03:20,801 --> 02:03:23,490
about Santa Claus or something along the
way.

2885
02:03:23,800 --> 02:03:28,800
We've been tricked and it's not your 
fault that you got tricked the prop man.

2886
02:03:28,841 --> 02:03:29,674
Sometimes it's not even the fault of the
person's tricking if they're being 

2887
02:03:31,601 --> 02:03:32,434
sincere and they're just,
they're just misinformed and they don't 

2888
02:03:34,601 --> 02:03:37,330
understand what they're doing is 
actually harmful.

2889
02:03:37,690 --> 02:03:41,890
And then they fight for their cause.
Like they have this thing that they do,

2890
02:03:42,070 --> 02:03:45,760
whether it's chiropractic or whether 
it's being an astrologer or whatever.

2891
02:03:45,970 --> 02:03:46,803
Then they like,
they dig in and they defend their turf 

2892
02:03:49,520 --> 02:03:50,540
yet.
But I,

2893
02:03:50,710 --> 02:03:52,620
I apologize for interrupting or saying 
about band check.

2894
02:03:52,621 --> 02:03:53,454
It's or if you were about to go into 
when they fold people at their fake 

2895
02:03:56,201 --> 02:03:57,700
site,
put the fake psychic.

2896
02:03:57,701 --> 02:03:58,301
No,
I'm good.

2897
02:03:58,301 --> 02:04:00,610
He is at reading people and we had him 
on.

2898
02:04:00,640 --> 02:04:02,790
I did a show called Joe Rogan questions 
everything.

2899
02:04:03,050 --> 02:04:03,883
And Bennett check was one of the 
episodes where he was explaining to me 

2900
02:04:07,480 --> 02:04:08,313
how they do cold read and explained to 
me how they lead people into giving him 

2901
02:04:12,851 --> 02:04:17,140
enough information that he can form a 
reasonable assessment of who they are.

2902
02:04:17,141 --> 02:04:21,340
And then he would answer certain,
asked certain leading questions and he's

2903
02:04:21,341 --> 02:04:23,290
like,
I've just done this so many times,

2904
02:04:23,291 --> 02:04:24,124
I know how to get the.
And people are shocked and they don't 

2905
02:04:26,051 --> 02:04:28,150
know what to do and they've never done 
this before.

2906
02:04:28,151 --> 02:04:28,820
So,
you know,

2907
02:04:28,820 --> 02:04:29,653
it's like you can ask them questions and
they start giving you information and 

2908
02:04:32,201 --> 02:04:34,260
like your parents were divorced when you
were young.

2909
02:04:34,630 --> 02:04:35,920
How do you know?
Because it's,

2910
02:04:37,100 --> 02:04:38,370
it's so common,

2911
02:04:38,370 --> 02:04:39,690
first of all,
and you know,

2912
02:04:39,691 --> 02:04:43,320
you can read certain things from people.
And I mean,

2913
02:04:43,321 --> 02:04:45,030
he showed us a bunch of shit that he 
does,

2914
02:04:45,031 --> 02:04:45,864
like the spoon bending thing,
a bunch of different things that people 

2915
02:04:48,901 --> 02:04:49,734
want you to say that it's magic.
It's funny because there's a big 

2916
02:04:52,861 --> 02:04:55,500
crossover with the magician community,
uh,

2917
02:04:55,501 --> 02:04:56,334
and the skeptic community.
And it's because they know how easy it 

2918
02:04:58,441 --> 02:05:01,770
is to trick the fuck out of people.
And I kind of love that.

2919
02:05:01,771 --> 02:05:02,604
It's kind of,
it's been interesting to see this group 

2920
02:05:03,991 --> 02:05:04,824
of entertainers that people think of as 
goofballs be this kind of a little bit 

2921
02:05:08,311 --> 02:05:10,880
of a bastion of intellectual ism.
Because I,

2922
02:05:10,881 --> 02:05:13,350
I like it.
It's hard to get people to pay attention

2923
02:05:13,351 --> 02:05:14,184
to anything on the Internet.
But if you make it funny and you add a 

2924
02:05:16,531 --> 02:05:18,210
Dick joke,
suddenly people are like,

2925
02:05:18,211 --> 02:05:19,500
I got to learn about this.

2926
02:05:19,720 --> 02:05:22,050
So that's why Penn and teller think are 
so important.

2927
02:05:22,051 --> 02:05:25,800
Because they were the first magicians 
who were really adamant and what they're

2928
02:05:25,801 --> 02:05:27,900
doing is bullshit.
Like,

2929
02:05:28,650 --> 02:05:29,640
nope,
we're tricking you.

2930
02:05:29,641 --> 02:05:30,474
And they use that word trick.
And I liked that they were really good 

2931
02:05:33,240 --> 02:05:34,440
at.
It's still going to be awesome.

2932
02:05:34,441 --> 02:05:36,120
You're still going to watch.
And every grade time.

2933
02:05:36,470 --> 02:05:37,820
And they were,
they were totally upfront.

2934
02:05:37,890 --> 02:05:38,491
They're like,
no,

2935
02:05:38,491 --> 02:05:41,490
there's no magic.
We're motherfucking tricking you.

2936
02:05:41,880 --> 02:05:43,440
There's shows.
God Damn.

2937
02:05:43,441 --> 02:05:44,274
Those shows were hilarious.
Some of those bullshit shows with a 

2938
02:05:45,841 --> 02:05:47,420
catch people.
And this,

2939
02:05:47,490 --> 02:05:48,323
the,
the nonsense that they're promoting 

2940
02:05:49,500 --> 02:05:52,230
pushing.
One of my favorite ones is there was a,

2941
02:05:52,231 --> 02:05:54,060
uh,
there was an episode where they attacked

2942
02:05:54,061 --> 02:05:54,894
organic food and they did,
and this is this thing where people 

2943
02:05:57,601 --> 02:05:59,730
doubled down on things.
Uh,

2944
02:05:59,760 --> 02:06:01,560
they took a banana,
cut it in half,

2945
02:06:01,880 --> 02:06:04,230
and it was,
I believe a conventionally grown banana.

2946
02:06:04,230 --> 02:06:06,480
And on one plate they'd say it was an 
organic banana.

2947
02:06:06,481 --> 02:06:09,240
The other plate,
they'd say it was a organic,

2948
02:06:09,241 --> 02:06:10,074
the other plate a conventionally grown 
and have people take a bite out of each 

2949
02:06:12,361 --> 02:06:14,210
one and people,
you know,

2950
02:06:14,220 --> 02:06:15,053
they'd sit there describing the organic 
banana is creamy and sweet and tastes 

2951
02:06:18,451 --> 02:06:19,680
like a banana.
Should taste.

2952
02:06:19,681 --> 02:06:21,420
And the conventionally grown.
Yeah,

2953
02:06:21,421 --> 02:06:24,210
it's really bland and it doesn't taste 
good.

2954
02:06:24,211 --> 02:06:26,790
And this one girl,
after they explained to quote pen,

2955
02:06:26,791 --> 02:06:31,700
it's the same fucking but m and this one
girl afterwards,

2956
02:06:31,710 --> 02:06:34,410
she's like,
I don't know if it makes me question my,

2957
02:06:34,440 --> 02:06:36,840
my opinion of organic versus 
conventional.

2958
02:06:36,841 --> 02:06:39,900
It really makes me question the concept 
of the banana.

2959
02:06:39,901 --> 02:06:42,990
I'm like,
oh girl,

2960
02:06:42,991 --> 02:06:46,260
you're going to waste so much money.
It's pulled it off.

2961
02:06:46,650 --> 02:06:48,750
I got mad at me yesterday.
I did.

2962
02:06:48,751 --> 02:06:50,140
The dumb girl wants.
Well it's,

2963
02:06:50,380 --> 02:06:51,890
I,
I,

2964
02:06:52,300 --> 02:06:53,120
it's,
it's,

2965
02:06:53,120 --> 02:06:53,970
it's a skill.

2966
02:06:53,970 --> 02:06:56,040
It's one of the skills I bring to the 
table.

2967
02:06:56,880 --> 02:06:59,170
We can get away with it though.
It's girls can get away with it.

2968
02:06:59,230 --> 02:07:00,070
I'd say.
I,

2969
02:07:00,170 --> 02:07:02,760
I think I thought I got an okay 
impression of Penn,

2970
02:07:02,761 --> 02:07:03,594
but no yelling,
no it just enough attempting to destroy 

2971
02:07:09,031 --> 02:07:09,864
my vocal cords will,
will produce a pen impression almost 

2972
02:07:12,630 --> 02:07:17,250
what I think it's a unique time for 
exposing bullshit and you know,

2973
02:07:17,340 --> 02:07:20,940
because there's enough articles and 
videos and there's enough.

2974
02:07:20,970 --> 02:07:23,790
Like you can kind of get a sense like,
oh I see a pattern here.

2975
02:07:23,940 --> 02:07:24,773
People are a lot of people.
I think people are tired of not knowing 

2976
02:07:27,781 --> 02:07:28,614
what's real on the Internet and it's 
partially like this whole trend with 

2977
02:07:30,331 --> 02:07:32,790
fake news and like,
there,

2978
02:07:32,870 --> 02:07:36,080
there's kind of a breaking point I think
in terms of what people

2979
02:07:36,120 --> 02:07:36,953
are,
are willing to accept a for just shit 

2980
02:07:40,121 --> 02:07:43,960
being spewed on the Internet and being 
accepted as real because there's so much

2981
02:07:43,961 --> 02:07:44,794
content out there and people want to 
spend their time reading stuff that's 

2982
02:07:49,031 --> 02:07:53,140
for real and that they can trust and 
they don't want to trust shitty sources,

2983
02:07:53,141 --> 02:07:54,640
you know,
like they want to go,

2984
02:07:54,641 --> 02:07:56,170
all right,
here's a source I can trust,

2985
02:07:56,171 --> 02:07:59,380
I can keep going back to this website.
I can get good information.

2986
02:07:59,660 --> 02:08:01,690
And they want things explained,
uh,

2987
02:08:01,691 --> 02:08:04,800
that they know was researched well.
And I,

2988
02:08:04,801 --> 02:08:05,634
I think that this is a,
this is a valuable good to offer out to 

2989
02:08:09,071 --> 02:08:10,240
people saying,
you know,

2990
02:08:10,241 --> 02:08:11,074
here's something real and here's some.
And here's a Dick joke to read while 

2991
02:08:13,331 --> 02:08:16,690
you're reading something real.
So I am for a good Dick joke to,

2992
02:08:16,750 --> 02:08:18,310
to research ratio

2993
02:08:18,980 --> 02:08:19,813
for as well.
Now when you did this article and you 

2994
02:08:22,011 --> 02:08:24,380
know,
you said it was 4,000 words,

2995
02:08:24,381 --> 02:08:28,050
it's a particularly long article.
What did you have to omit?

2996
02:08:28,070 --> 02:08:28,950
I mean,
did it seems like,

2997
02:08:29,350 --> 02:08:31,550
I mean,
when you're dealing with 4,000 words,

2998
02:08:31,551 --> 02:08:32,330
I mean it,
was it just the,

2999
02:08:32,330 --> 02:08:35,720
the comprehensive coverage on why 
chiropractic websites bullshit?

3000
02:08:35,721 --> 02:08:36,830
Or is it just like,
like,

3001
02:08:37,050 --> 02:08:37,883
God damn,
I gotTa keep this thing as tight as I 

3002
02:08:38,961 --> 02:08:40,120
can,
but there's so much to.

3003
02:08:40,590 --> 02:08:41,220
Well,
it's,

3004
02:08:41,220 --> 02:08:43,110
I was going to joke while I do get paid 
by the word.

3005
02:08:44,360 --> 02:08:45,193
Well that's true,
but it wasn't like I never go into it 

3006
02:08:47,671 --> 02:08:48,504
going,
let's make it as long as I can or make 

3007
02:08:49,471 --> 02:08:52,770
it as short as I can.
We like I'm a contributing writer at the

3008
02:08:52,771 --> 02:08:53,910
outline now.
Um,

3009
02:08:53,911 --> 02:08:56,730
and this is,
and it's whenever we write a piece,

3010
02:08:56,731 --> 02:08:57,564
it's always,
let's make it cover the topic in as 

3011
02:09:00,901 --> 02:09:03,720
entertaining and,
and as,

3012
02:09:04,150 --> 02:09:06,650
uh,
as cohesive as a,

3013
02:09:06,651 --> 02:09:08,640
of a story as possible.
I'm old.

3014
02:09:08,641 --> 02:09:09,780
Go for it.
Let's go.

3015
02:09:10,200 --> 02:09:14,040
We kind of say what points do we want to
cover in this piece?

3016
02:09:14,041 --> 02:09:17,940
And sometimes it's um,
and it's basically to tell a good story.

3017
02:09:17,941 --> 02:09:18,774
And My,
my goal whenever I write an article in 

3018
02:09:19,681 --> 02:09:22,850
something is let's write the best,
uh,

3019
02:09:22,890 --> 02:09:26,220
let's write a piece so that I never have
to cover this topic again.

3020
02:09:26,490 --> 02:09:28,980
And with Chiropractic,
like I like,

3021
02:09:28,981 --> 02:09:29,814
I could.
One thing I would have liked to have 

3022
02:09:31,291 --> 02:09:33,300
covered if somehow we could have made it
like either,

3023
02:09:33,301 --> 02:09:33,640
you know,
if,

3024
02:09:33,640 --> 02:09:34,473
if somehow we could have condensed it a 
little so we could have fit something 

3025
02:09:36,931 --> 02:09:37,764
else in,
I would have maybe added an a piece on 

3026
02:09:40,501 --> 02:09:41,031
our,
they're science,

3027
02:09:41,031 --> 02:09:43,410
science-based chiropractors.
Is that possible?

3028
02:09:43,930 --> 02:09:47,070
Here's an impossible to be a science 
based card reader.

3029
02:09:47,100 --> 02:09:48,660
Yeah.
I mean that's the problem is like,

3030
02:09:48,661 --> 02:09:50,790
I feel like,
like it was,

3031
02:09:50,940 --> 02:09:54,980
we tried to present one point of view 
while still giving a hat too.

3032
02:09:54,981 --> 02:09:58,500
Like we included a link on some 
chiropractors that are showing,

3033
02:09:58,720 --> 02:10:00,720
you know,
that they're trying to be science based.

3034
02:10:00,721 --> 02:10:01,554
So I think that adding in a whole 
section on it would have maybe 

3035
02:10:03,331 --> 02:10:05,910
diminished from the point of view of it.
So being,

3036
02:10:05,970 --> 02:10:06,803
making it good reading and you know,
a cohesive point of view is always 

3037
02:10:10,051 --> 02:10:11,010
important to the article.

3038
02:10:11,200 --> 02:10:12,060
Right.
But let me stop you there.

3039
02:10:12,440 --> 02:10:17,440
You say chiropractor science based.
If it was bullshit when it started,

3040
02:10:18,120 --> 02:10:20,680
if it was something that was created by 
a magnetic healer,

3041
02:10:20,681 --> 02:10:22,930
it was,
it was a nonsense thing that came from a

3042
02:10:22,931 --> 02:10:26,500
seance.
How does that ever become science based?

3043
02:10:26,501 --> 02:10:28,570
If the original,
the origin.

3044
02:10:28,600 --> 02:10:32,980
It's not based on medical research where
they figured out that if you do,

3045
02:10:33,440 --> 02:10:34,010
look,
here's all

3046
02:10:34,010 --> 02:10:35,960
the studies that we've shown when you do
this,

3047
02:10:36,110 --> 02:10:39,240
this is the immune system responds to 
the body has to be in.

3048
02:10:39,250 --> 02:10:40,130
There's none of that,
right?

3049
02:10:40,220 --> 02:10:41,520
It doesn't exist.
Well there is,

3050
02:10:41,690 --> 02:10:42,523
there is some and it some but the minor 
evidence but subjective pain relief and 

3051
02:10:46,920 --> 02:10:47,753
that's it and I don't want to diminish 
and this is something that I'm sure 

3052
02:10:49,941 --> 02:10:52,820
people are sitting there like with 
daggers still mad at us for saying,

3053
02:10:52,821 --> 02:10:54,010
you know,
for questioning their,

3054
02:10:54,050 --> 02:10:54,883
their subjective experiences.
I don't want to tell people that they 

3055
02:10:57,501 --> 02:11:01,220
did not feel relief from what they cause
pain is.

3056
02:11:01,221 --> 02:11:03,320
It's really subjective and it's hard to 
manage.

3057
02:11:03,620 --> 02:11:04,453
So I think that there are chiropractors 
who aim specifically to relieve lower 

3058
02:11:08,141 --> 02:11:09,250
back pain.
Um,

3059
02:11:09,251 --> 02:11:11,750
and I mean,
I think if you aim just to do that,

3060
02:11:12,010 --> 02:11:12,843
uh,
with your chiropractic practice while 

3061
02:11:14,211 --> 02:11:15,380
still telling people,
look,

3062
02:11:15,381 --> 02:11:18,140
I'm just doing this while you go to 
physical therapy,

3063
02:11:18,260 --> 02:11:20,420
you should still be going to a physical 
therapist.

3064
02:11:20,570 --> 02:11:21,403
This is an adjunctive things solely to 
relieve pain and they try to see how it 

3065
02:11:26,511 --> 02:11:30,380
can just relieve pain.
I think it's possible that,

3066
02:11:30,381 --> 02:11:31,214
that can do that,
but I think that adding that into the 

3067
02:11:32,121 --> 02:11:34,610
article,
it takes away from it a bit,

3068
02:11:34,870 --> 02:11:35,890
uh,
because that's,

3069
02:11:35,950 --> 02:11:37,520
that's not part of the article's point 
of view.

3070
02:11:37,521 --> 02:11:38,354
And it's also not part of my point of 
view of how it's not a science based 

3071
02:11:41,541 --> 02:11:43,100
practice.
So I think that,

3072
02:11:43,160 --> 02:11:45,530
and I mean,
I've seen some ethical chiropractors,

3073
02:11:45,531 --> 02:11:47,280
there's Sam Homo,
Pamela.

3074
02:11:47,300 --> 02:11:48,133
I'm not sure how to pronounce his name.
I've never heard it said out loud 

3075
02:11:49,821 --> 02:11:50,720
before.
Uh,

3076
02:11:50,721 --> 02:11:53,600
but that was one of the chiropractors 
who I cited in there who,

3077
02:11:53,601 --> 02:11:54,434
you know,
he's continued to practice while 

3078
02:11:55,251 --> 02:11:56,084
speaking out against the Chiropractic,
very vocally speaking out against 

3079
02:11:59,211 --> 02:12:02,060
Chiropractic as a whole because he's 
seen that it can,

3080
02:12:02,061 --> 02:12:02,894
you know,
and there is some adult manipulating 

3081
02:12:04,191 --> 02:12:06,410
back he is,
but he's what's going on there,

3082
02:12:06,950 --> 02:12:07,760
what does that do?

3083
02:12:07,760 --> 02:12:08,593
And that's what all the things where I 
feel like I'm in a gray area because I 

3084
02:12:10,611 --> 02:12:11,444
don't want to diminish the people who've
said that it's helped them have pain 

3085
02:12:14,991 --> 02:12:15,824
relief.
But I also think these people should be 

3086
02:12:16,551 --> 02:12:18,130
going to,
um,

3087
02:12:18,380 --> 02:12:20,360
you know,
to a,

3088
02:12:20,361 --> 02:12:21,140
uh,
you know,

3089
02:12:21,140 --> 02:12:23,660
to a physical therapist and a massage 
therapist.

3090
02:12:23,661 --> 02:12:27,800
So I'm not sure what the,
I'm not sure what the exact right answer

3091
02:12:27,801 --> 02:12:29,420
is on that.
If someone says,

3092
02:12:29,600 --> 02:12:30,433
I've been to a physical therapist,
I've been to a massage therapist and 

3093
02:12:33,741 --> 02:12:35,870
this is the only thing that's ever made 
it feel better.

3094
02:12:35,871 --> 02:12:37,520
And I went in one session,
what do you say?

3095
02:12:37,580 --> 02:12:38,413
Like,
and I don't know where the exact right 

3096
02:12:40,521 --> 02:12:43,820
answer is to that,
but if it all started from bullshit,

3097
02:12:43,821 --> 02:12:46,580
it seems so hard.
If the foundation is bullshit.

3098
02:12:46,581 --> 02:12:47,414
Yeah,
and I mean I went to a guy that was 

3099
02:12:49,010 --> 02:12:49,843
really good at a bunch of other stuff,
like he would give you a dms electrical 

3100
02:12:52,761 --> 02:12:54,680
muscular pads on.

3101
02:12:55,120 --> 02:12:56,910
I have one,
I have a small little car.

3102
02:12:56,930 --> 02:13:00,380
He had really good massage therapist who
provided physical therapy.

3103
02:13:00,381 --> 02:13:02,720
He had a little gym set up at the end of
the day.

3104
02:13:02,730 --> 02:13:04,250
Still cracking backs.
Well,

3105
02:13:04,251 --> 02:13:05,600
here's a question.
What if,

3106
02:13:05,630 --> 02:13:09,230
and this is again at this completely 
hypothetical,

3107
02:13:09,380 --> 02:13:10,213
what if it hadn't been started by this 
nutjob back into killer and it was a 

3108
02:13:12,921 --> 02:13:14,210
doctor who said,
oh,

3109
02:13:14,240 --> 02:13:16,730
this can,
this can help.

3110
02:13:16,940 --> 02:13:17,773
And if it was a just an osteopath who 
was trying to see if this could help 

3111
02:13:21,141 --> 02:13:23,060
relieve pain along with physical 
therapy.

3112
02:13:23,240 --> 02:13:26,000
So I,
I encourage people if they're,

3113
02:13:26,180 --> 02:13:28,730
if they are looking for a way that 
manipulation can help,

3114
02:13:29,000 --> 02:13:29,833
maybe not go to a chiropractor,
but seek out in your medical practice 

3115
02:13:33,061 --> 02:13:33,894
and osteopath who can,
who knows much more about anatomy and 

3116
02:13:36,661 --> 02:13:37,494
please keep going to a physical 
therapist and maybe a massage therapist 

3117
02:13:40,201 --> 02:13:40,770
because ms dot.

3118
02:13:40,770 --> 02:13:43,700
I just feel fucking great.
So that's just,

3119
02:13:43,800 --> 02:13:46,470
it's so hard to say that,
you know,

3120
02:13:46,500 --> 02:13:50,220
there's like science based ones when it 
all started out with bullshit,

3121
02:13:50,221 --> 02:13:50,910
like,
you know,

3122
02:13:50,910 --> 02:13:53,580
it's going to be,
it will be very hard for you to find a,

3123
02:13:53,610 --> 02:13:54,443
you know,
quote unquote science based 

3124
02:13:55,291 --> 02:13:56,940
Chiropractor,
please,

3125
02:13:56,941 --> 02:13:57,631
if you're,
you know,

3126
02:13:57,631 --> 02:13:59,700
if the only thing that's relieving your 
back pain and I get it,

3127
02:13:59,701 --> 02:14:00,390
I have,
you know,

3128
02:14:00,390 --> 02:14:04,710
I have scoliosis back pain issues are 
very hard to manage a,

3129
02:14:04,711 --> 02:14:05,544
you know,
an osteopath will understand your 

3130
02:14:07,021 --> 02:14:07,854
anatomy much better.
They're not going to say you have to 

3131
02:14:09,511 --> 02:14:10,344
come back in three times a week,
they're going to send you to a physical 

3132
02:14:12,631 --> 02:14:15,150
therapist and you know,
maybe recommended massage,

3133
02:14:15,180 --> 02:14:16,860
but they'll,
they'll do it in a,

3134
02:14:16,880 --> 02:14:18,600
in an ethical fashion.
Uh,

3135
02:14:18,700 --> 02:14:21,450
and not overstep their reached.
But that's,

3136
02:14:21,451 --> 02:14:22,284
you know,
there is some evidence that it helps 

3137
02:14:24,510 --> 02:14:29,040
with lower back pain but not more than 
physical therapy or massage.

3138
02:14:29,040 --> 02:14:29,873
And that's,
I think what people should take away 

3139
02:14:31,051 --> 02:14:33,300
from this.
I'm not saying it can't do anything,

3140
02:14:33,301 --> 02:14:34,134
I'm saying it's not the best thing.
And that's also a problem because most 

3141
02:14:37,081 --> 02:14:42,081
chiropractors also incorporate massage 
and it's so hard to decide like what,

3142
02:14:43,110 --> 02:14:44,570
what is helping you?
Yeah.

3143
02:14:44,580 --> 02:14:46,740
And I mean that's like,
I think it's,

3144
02:14:46,741 --> 02:14:49,620
and I get it like I'm a,
I don't want to.

3145
02:14:49,980 --> 02:14:52,870
I think the hardest part is telling 
people that their subjective experiences

3146
02:14:52,890 --> 02:14:54,780
wrong because that's like,
you don't,

3147
02:14:55,300 --> 02:14:56,133
I don't want to be that asshole who's 
like necessarily you're saying it's 

3148
02:14:57,751 --> 02:14:58,584
wrong,
but you're saying reevaluate what the 

3149
02:15:00,301 --> 02:15:01,950
root cause.
Yeah.

3150
02:15:01,951 --> 02:15:04,430
And it's like,
I know what I mean.

3151
02:15:04,450 --> 02:15:07,170
It's like if you went to a chiropractor,
you're not stupid.

3152
02:15:07,171 --> 02:15:08,970
You're not wrong.
You're not a moron.

3153
02:15:09,140 --> 02:15:09,661
You're,
you know,

3154
02:15:09,661 --> 02:15:10,494
you're someone who's suffering.
And I both have both of us understand 

3155
02:15:13,561 --> 02:15:14,430
that it's just,
you know,

3156
02:15:14,520 --> 02:15:15,353
make sure you're not being,
that the person who's selling to you 

3157
02:15:17,941 --> 02:15:18,774
isn't selling a line and not telling you
that it can fix your immune system and 

3158
02:15:22,980 --> 02:15:25,120
cure your baby to the point where it 
doesn't need to.

3159
02:15:25,420 --> 02:15:26,253
Please,
please don't let someone do that to you 

3160
02:15:28,261 --> 02:15:32,640
because measles,
measles is a real thing that can.

3161
02:15:33,420 --> 02:15:36,680
I was hoping cough.
It's Ian.

3162
02:15:36,700 --> 02:15:37,533
This is kind of,
uh,

3163
02:15:37,800 --> 02:15:38,431
have,
uh,

3164
02:15:38,431 --> 02:15:39,091
did you,
uh,

3165
02:15:39,091 --> 02:15:40,000
it's,
um,

3166
02:15:40,110 --> 02:15:42,780
have you ever gotten a whooping cough?
Because once I got it,

3167
02:15:43,290 --> 02:15:46,380
I got it as an adults because in this is
kind of,

3168
02:15:46,410 --> 02:15:47,243
this is kind of shitty.
They do need to make a new whooping 

3169
02:15:48,571 --> 02:15:50,610
cough vaccine that is not a reason not 
to get it.

3170
02:15:50,880 --> 02:15:52,320
Please get it,
please re up it.

3171
02:15:53,080 --> 02:15:55,590
But the whooping cough vaccine,
when they made it a,

3172
02:15:55,591 --> 02:15:59,100
some strains of it wore off faster,
uh,

3173
02:15:59,160 --> 02:16:03,690
than was originally expected.
Somebody came into my lab and we were,

3174
02:16:03,691 --> 02:16:04,800
I mean,
we were given,

3175
02:16:04,860 --> 02:16:05,521
um,
you know,

3176
02:16:05,521 --> 02:16:08,250
along with our packages working to labs 
ago,

3177
02:16:08,490 --> 02:16:10,200
I'm at a drug testing lab.
Um,

3178
02:16:10,280 --> 02:16:11,113
we were given health insurance and it 
was around the time of the first 

3179
02:16:13,170 --> 02:16:14,410
obamacare debate,
you know,

3180
02:16:14,430 --> 02:16:16,530
when people are all like,
I don't need to buy healthcare.

3181
02:16:16,770 --> 02:16:18,210
And one of the guys in the lab who was 
all,

3182
02:16:18,211 --> 02:16:19,680
why should I get healthcare?
I'm healthy.

3183
02:16:19,800 --> 02:16:22,710
He showed up with whooping cough and for
two weeks we didn't know he had it.

3184
02:16:22,711 --> 02:16:24,000
He was just sick.
And everyone's like,

3185
02:16:24,001 --> 02:16:24,840
Craig,
go to the doctor,

3186
02:16:24,841 --> 02:16:25,621
Craig,
go to the doctor,

3187
02:16:25,621 --> 02:16:26,460
Craig,
go to the doctor,

3188
02:16:26,880 --> 02:16:30,340
five of us got whooping cough from one 
guy from one guy.

3189
02:16:30,370 --> 02:16:33,580
Let him hear the end of it.
Fucking Craig.

3190
02:16:33,640 --> 02:16:35,170
It's fucking Craig,
man.

3191
02:16:35,200 --> 02:16:36,570
Fucking Craig.
Um,

3192
02:16:36,670 --> 02:16:37,181
I,
uh,

3193
02:16:37,181 --> 02:16:38,014
I was out of work.
We all had to stay out of work for five 

3194
02:16:39,371 --> 02:16:40,510
days.
All of us who had it.

3195
02:16:40,511 --> 02:16:41,141
So.
And I'm like.

3196
02:16:41,141 --> 02:16:41,974
And within the course of a month,
and this was just bad luck within the 

3197
02:16:45,311 --> 02:16:47,170
course of a month,
I had had hip surgery,

3198
02:16:47,640 --> 02:16:50,500
a torn ligament in my hip running an 
ultra marathon.

3199
02:16:50,740 --> 02:16:51,573
Never,
uh,

3200
02:16:51,700 --> 02:16:53,050
don't,
don't run an ultra marathon.

3201
02:16:53,050 --> 02:16:53,883
It's a bad idea.
Was hitting a car accident and got 

3202
02:16:56,681 --> 02:16:57,600
whooping cough with it.
Wait,

3203
02:16:57,610 --> 02:16:59,350
that was six weeks.
So I'm like,

3204
02:16:59,351 --> 02:17:02,200
I had no vacation time left to miss 
work.

3205
02:17:02,201 --> 02:17:04,060
And I was out because somebody coughed 
on me.

3206
02:17:04,350 --> 02:17:07,280
Buddy of mine runs ultra marathons all 
the time there.

3207
02:17:07,570 --> 02:17:09,970
I didn't realize at the time that I had 
a joint disorder.

3208
02:17:10,190 --> 02:17:11,023
Yeah.
Well don't run them a few of a buildup 

3209
02:17:13,530 --> 02:17:14,860
to him.
Oh No.

3210
02:17:14,861 --> 02:17:16,900
You need to try.
And I mean I trained properly,

3211
02:17:16,901 --> 02:17:18,100
it just,
I didn't realize I'm like,

3212
02:17:18,101 --> 02:17:20,620
my hip is hurting and I went to my 
surgeon and this is,

3213
02:17:20,860 --> 02:17:21,693
this is something that I,
that chiropractic does a yell about in 

3214
02:17:25,061 --> 02:17:25,894
the pain care system and in,
in the medical system that they have a 

3215
02:17:28,061 --> 02:17:30,910
point about Dr Stu throw pills at you 
haphazardly.

3216
02:17:30,970 --> 02:17:35,050
My doctor and I'm,
I'm never gonna not be mad about this.

3217
02:17:35,350 --> 02:17:36,183
My doctor,
instead of saying we should do a scan 

3218
02:17:37,631 --> 02:17:38,464
with contrast to see what's going on 
because you're really complaining about 

3219
02:17:40,661 --> 02:17:41,494
this.
Chucked me a bottle of Vicodin and said 

3220
02:17:43,391 --> 02:17:45,850
go ahead and run.
Yeah.

3221
02:17:47,160 --> 02:17:48,960
Doctor's name.
Oh yeah.

3222
02:17:49,000 --> 02:17:51,150
I'm not going to say because you know,
it's like it's,

3223
02:17:51,300 --> 02:17:54,070
there was that part of me that was 
really happy that I got to do my ultra.

3224
02:17:54,071 --> 02:17:56,950
But God damn it,
if you need Vicodin to run a marathon,

3225
02:17:56,951 --> 02:17:59,380
don't do it.
Dr. Oh yeah.

3226
02:17:59,381 --> 02:18:00,220
It's.
I mean don't,

3227
02:18:00,250 --> 02:18:01,083
don't do that.
But I mean it was funny because after I 

3228
02:18:02,051 --> 02:18:02,681
ran it,
I'm like,

3229
02:18:02,681 --> 02:18:03,514
alright,
I don't need to take the medication any 

3230
02:18:04,990 --> 02:18:08,410
more because I'm not running.
And suddenly I realized how fucked up my

3231
02:18:08,411 --> 02:18:10,510
hip was and it was like,
oh my God,

3232
02:18:10,511 --> 02:18:12,050
I can barely walk.
Like,

3233
02:18:12,160 --> 02:18:14,630
what was wrong with him?
He tore a ligament or a torn my labor.

3234
02:18:14,630 --> 02:18:17,470
Um,
and it was like it was tightened up.

3235
02:18:17,840 --> 02:18:20,270
Just say it's,
I mean,

3236
02:18:20,280 --> 02:18:23,240
there's all they have are like two 
little scars because like,

3237
02:18:23,300 --> 02:18:26,140
it was,
it was such an easy surgery that the day

3238
02:18:26,141 --> 02:18:29,260
of surgery it felt less bad than it did 
the day before.

3239
02:18:29,490 --> 02:18:31,000
Um,
and it was like,

3240
02:18:31,001 --> 02:18:33,030
it was fun.
It was the week that I turned 29.

3241
02:18:33,040 --> 02:18:33,873
I'm like,
it's turned into an and already I'm 

3242
02:18:35,351 --> 02:18:36,700
getting hip surgery.
I'm like,

3243
02:18:36,701 --> 02:18:38,020
this was,
this was,

3244
02:18:38,021 --> 02:18:38,561
uh,
yeah.

3245
02:18:38,561 --> 02:18:39,510
So that was my,
my,

3246
02:18:39,580 --> 02:18:42,670
all of my surgeries have been on.
I'm pretty sure my parents dropped me as

3247
02:18:42,671 --> 02:18:43,504
a baby and just won't admit to it 
because my headache left side three 

3248
02:18:45,911 --> 02:18:48,670
surgeries on my left shoulder surgery on
my left hip.

3249
02:18:48,680 --> 02:18:50,920
I'm like,
I'm right handed,

3250
02:18:50,921 --> 02:18:52,980
but I'm doing everything with your right
side.

3251
02:18:53,060 --> 02:18:53,893
Left,
left side's atrophy kind of 

3252
02:18:54,641 --> 02:18:55,474
ambidextrous.
One of my friends is an archery 

3253
02:18:56,861 --> 02:18:59,560
instructor and I'm learning how to to 
shoot bows and arrows,

3254
02:18:59,561 --> 02:19:01,270
you know,
just just in case the revolution come.

3255
02:19:01,270 --> 02:19:02,103
No,
not really,

3256
02:19:02,170 --> 02:19:03,190
but it's,
I'm,

3257
02:19:03,260 --> 02:19:05,380
I'm off.
I shoot with a,

3258
02:19:05,460 --> 02:19:06,293
my hand,
my strong hand is my left hand and I'm 

3259
02:19:07,811 --> 02:19:11,590
like my dominant on my left.
I pulled back on the wait,

3260
02:19:11,591 --> 02:19:12,424
which one gets back on the left and the 
left and pull back on the left and my 

3261
02:19:16,331 --> 02:19:17,164
right arm keeps getting bruised like 
crazy and I have to keep explaining to 

3262
02:19:19,391 --> 02:19:24,391
people that I'm not getting hit the skin
slapping with this one need better form.

3263
02:19:25,830 --> 02:19:27,990
Yeah,
and it keeps on going up.

3264
02:19:28,700 --> 02:19:30,340
Why don't you put one of those risk 
things?

3265
02:19:30,580 --> 02:19:34,010
Are they the forum thing?
Have one and it's the worst.

3266
02:19:34,120 --> 02:19:36,380
This is the worst thing that happens 
because like all I have to do is go like

3267
02:19:36,381 --> 02:19:37,214
this to get my arm out of the way and 
instead the couple of this is the worst 

3268
02:19:40,251 --> 02:19:43,460
is when the string catches right here 
and this giant bruise.

3269
02:19:43,490 --> 02:19:44,323
Right?
Using a compound bow or a traditional 

3270
02:19:46,401 --> 02:19:48,380
bow.
I think it's along,

3271
02:19:48,500 --> 02:19:50,870
but I don't know off the top of the cams
in it,

3272
02:19:50,871 --> 02:19:52,200
like these big.
No,

3273
02:19:52,210 --> 02:19:52,860
it's,
it's a,

3274
02:19:52,860 --> 02:19:55,150
it's a fairly simple starter bow.
It's my friend,

3275
02:19:55,220 --> 02:19:56,090
my friend Anna.
She's,

3276
02:19:56,270 --> 02:19:58,400
she knows all the things we're doing and
it's like,

3277
02:19:58,401 --> 02:20:01,910
I'm just kind of show from Mike,
Please let me not kill myself.

3278
02:20:01,911 --> 02:20:02,970
So it's,
it's,

3279
02:20:03,300 --> 02:20:04,640
it's a,
it's a thing where it's like,

3280
02:20:04,641 --> 02:20:06,490
it's a lot of fun and I'm,
I,

3281
02:20:06,500 --> 02:20:08,690
I'm loving the crap out of it.
It's great.

3282
02:20:08,720 --> 02:20:11,500
A great workout,
especially for your lats and uh,

3283
02:20:11,700 --> 02:20:13,760
and your upper shoulders.
But it's like,

3284
02:20:13,761 --> 02:20:14,760
dear God,
I'm,

3285
02:20:14,790 --> 02:20:16,840
I'm still clueless at what I'm doing.
It's funny because like,

3286
02:20:16,850 --> 02:20:18,770
she's like,
she's won a few tournaments.

3287
02:20:18,771 --> 02:20:20,500
She knows what she's doing.
Uh,

3288
02:20:20,550 --> 02:20:22,790
I'd gone shooting with her a few times.
Then we went to,

3289
02:20:22,820 --> 02:20:26,420
my boyfriend came with us and like,
he's hitting bull's eyes right away.

3290
02:20:26,420 --> 02:20:27,260
I'm like,
I'm like,

3291
02:20:27,261 --> 02:20:29,000
how the,
are you fucking kidding me?

3292
02:20:29,001 --> 02:20:31,250
He just naturally great at it.
I'm like,

3293
02:20:31,280 --> 02:20:33,170
what?
But I'm like,

3294
02:20:33,171 --> 02:20:34,490
I,
I saw meditation.

3295
02:20:34,550 --> 02:20:35,690
Oh yeah.
It's just,

3296
02:20:35,900 --> 02:20:36,980
you're just,
you're sitting there going,

3297
02:20:37,010 --> 02:20:38,660
who?
Who Do I want to pretend?

3298
02:20:38,661 --> 02:20:40,240
Isn't the Tartan,
but it's like,

3299
02:20:40,840 --> 02:20:41,720
no,
not at all.

3300
02:20:41,721 --> 02:20:42,880
I'm not.
I'm not an angry person.

3301
02:20:42,900 --> 02:20:43,940
Like it's,
it's funny.

3302
02:20:43,941 --> 02:20:44,774
I put all my,
all of my rage goes into my writing and 

3303
02:20:47,031 --> 02:20:47,864
like,
that's,

3304
02:20:48,110 --> 02:20:52,200
that's like all of the unlike anger 
daddy issues all the time,

3305
02:20:52,210 --> 02:20:54,980
so I didn't like why didn't,
why didn't this work?

3306
02:20:55,040 --> 02:20:55,880
God,
it,

3307
02:20:55,881 --> 02:20:59,270
all the anger goes into the writing.
Like the archery is just meditative.

3308
02:20:59,510 --> 02:21:02,840
Like it's relaxing.
It's like you're out in an open field.

3309
02:21:02,841 --> 02:21:03,621
There's,
it's like,

3310
02:21:03,621 --> 02:21:05,600
it's a really nice little archery range 
up in Glendale.

3311
02:21:05,880 --> 02:21:06,720
Oh yeah,
I know where that is.

3312
02:21:06,860 --> 02:21:07,693
Yeah.
I feel like it's one of those things 

3313
02:21:08,251 --> 02:21:09,084
where when you're doing it a requires so
much focus kind of drains you of 

3314
02:21:12,481 --> 02:21:13,210
distractions.

3315
02:21:13,210 --> 02:21:14,290
Yeah.
You're just,

3316
02:21:14,320 --> 02:21:15,520
you're funny.
Whenever.

3317
02:21:16,120 --> 02:21:16,953
Here's my nerdy moments.
Whenever we walked from the car to the 

3318
02:21:19,991 --> 02:21:20,824
range,
I turn on a superhero soundtracks and 

3319
02:21:23,081 --> 02:21:23,950
just walk out there.
I'm like,

3320
02:21:23,960 --> 02:21:26,090
I can feel like a hero soundtracks.
Like,

3321
02:21:26,100 --> 02:21:26,933
uh,
it's the soundtrack to deadpool while 

3322
02:21:28,991 --> 02:21:30,280
we're walking out there.
And I'm like,

3323
02:21:30,290 --> 02:21:31,170
oh,
I can,

3324
02:21:31,510 --> 02:21:34,240
I can feel slightly like a bad ass for 
five seconds.

3325
02:21:34,241 --> 02:21:36,970
Okay.
Before I go back to my life as a writer,

3326
02:21:37,650 --> 02:21:38,483
well thank you for your writing.
Thank you for writing that article on 

3327
02:21:41,280 --> 02:21:43,470
chiropractors being bullshit.
I'm sorry.

3328
02:21:43,471 --> 02:21:46,110
Chiropractors who are listening to this 
are fuming and angry.

3329
02:21:46,470 --> 02:21:47,600
They're going to hate me.
It's okay.

3330
02:21:47,670 --> 02:21:48,241
Well,
I mean,

3331
02:21:48,241 --> 02:21:53,241
everything you said is right though.
The real problem is what you did was you

3332
02:21:53,940 --> 02:21:56,090
expose something.
It's the one thing I.

3333
02:21:56,190 --> 02:21:57,660
and I keep waiting for this there,
you know,

3334
02:21:57,661 --> 02:22:00,540
there was the one article where somebody
called me a sith Lord and I'm like,

3335
02:22:00,541 --> 02:22:04,740
they and they gave it up because the 
article was a chiropractor.

3336
02:22:04,800 --> 02:22:05,633
I don't remember.
I think it was somebody who had went to 

3337
02:22:06,541 --> 02:22:09,000
one and they said only a sif deals in 
absolutes.

3338
02:22:09,001 --> 02:22:10,050
I'm like,
I'm like,

3339
02:22:10,051 --> 02:22:12,060
I'm part of the rebellion.
But no,

3340
02:22:12,100 --> 02:22:13,800
they uh,
that's so stupid.

3341
02:22:14,150 --> 02:22:16,120
It's a nerd out I,

3342
02:22:17,060 --> 02:22:19,140
I am a nerd and I'm okay with.
I'm there too.

3343
02:22:19,141 --> 02:22:20,680
But that's a,
that's so like,

3344
02:22:20,970 --> 02:22:24,410
that's such a nerd out way to fucking 
criticize someone.

3345
02:22:24,440 --> 02:22:24,820
It's

3346
02:22:24,820 --> 02:22:28,050
really calling me a sith Lord.
I have that on my twitter profile now.

3347
02:22:28,051 --> 02:22:29,280
I'm like,
legends sit,

3348
02:22:29,281 --> 02:22:30,570
Lord,
bring it on.

3349
02:22:31,120 --> 02:22:32,420
But it's,
I'm like,

3350
02:22:32,421 --> 02:22:34,140
you know,
I'm like,

3351
02:22:34,190 --> 02:22:35,023
what?
After all the insults that people have 

3352
02:22:36,181 --> 02:22:37,980
thrown,
I found an article written about me,

3353
02:22:37,981 --> 02:22:40,260
wants to know,
so beautiful that I said that I was,

3354
02:22:40,261 --> 02:22:41,110
uh,
that,

3355
02:22:41,240 --> 02:22:42,073
that I was on.
I was a big Pharma Shell because I had 

3356
02:22:44,391 --> 02:22:46,860
admitted to taking medication for my 
headache.

3357
02:22:46,880 --> 02:22:47,640
I'm like,
at that,

3358
02:22:47,640 --> 02:22:48,690
I'm like,
I don't think I'm a shell.

3359
02:22:48,691 --> 02:22:50,580
I think I'm,
I'm a customer.

3360
02:22:50,970 --> 02:22:53,970
They have the relationship backwards.
You can't read everything,

3361
02:22:54,030 --> 02:22:54,750
but no,
it's,

3362
02:22:54,750 --> 02:22:55,583
I can't fight the internet.
Talk about everything that you're 

3363
02:22:57,091 --> 02:22:58,020
reading.
You go crazy.

3364
02:22:59,700 --> 02:23:01,470
What's the correct pronunciation of your
name?

3365
02:23:02,090 --> 02:23:03,870
You've met Donald Trump.
Donald trump.

3366
02:23:04,140 --> 02:23:05,760
Donald trump.
