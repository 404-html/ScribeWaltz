1
00:00:02,400 --> 00:00:03,870
Hello my friends.

2
00:00:04,470 --> 00:00:05,640
It's time again,

3
00:00:05,940 --> 00:00:07,380
this episode of the podcast,

4
00:00:07,810 --> 00:00:08,260
um,

5
00:00:08,260 --> 00:00:09,540
this July 4th weekend.

6
00:00:10,140 --> 00:00:10,591
So,

7
00:00:10,591 --> 00:00:11,424
uh,

8
00:00:11,430 --> 00:00:14,280
I know you're going to be out
there at the lake or the beach,

9
00:00:14,430 --> 00:00:15,510
taking your clothes off,

10
00:00:15,780 --> 00:00:19,620
trying to look sexy and your swimsuit
and it's probably a disaster.

11
00:00:20,850 --> 00:00:21,950
We can help you ladies.

12
00:00:21,980 --> 00:00:22,813
Gentlemen,

13
00:00:22,860 --> 00:00:26,430
this episode is brought to you
by [inaudible] Dot Com it's O.

14
00:00:26,430 --> 00:00:26,430
N.

15
00:00:26,430 --> 00:00:26,430
N.

16
00:00:26,430 --> 00:00:26,430
I.

17
00:00:26,430 --> 00:00:26,431
T.

18
00:00:26,431 --> 00:00:30,930
I've always been a big proponent of
kettlebells because it's one of the first

19
00:00:30,931 --> 00:00:34,650
weightlifting things that I've ever done
that allows me to kind of get like the

20
00:00:34,651 --> 00:00:37,920
whole workout in like a lot of times
when I used to lift weights regular,

21
00:00:37,921 --> 00:00:39,960
I'd lift weights and then
another day I do cardio.

22
00:00:39,990 --> 00:00:41,010
I do one day weights,

23
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:42,150
one day cardio,

24
00:00:42,180 --> 00:00:44,250
but with a really good
kettle bell workout,

25
00:00:44,251 --> 00:00:48,810
I get a brutal cardio workout and it
allows me to get it all done in one shot.

26
00:00:49,590 --> 00:00:50,670
I'm a huge fan of them.

27
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:51,390
They just,

28
00:00:51,390 --> 00:00:53,550
it's fun to do and it's a,

29
00:00:53,551 --> 00:00:58,551
it makes you feel like some Russian
savage living in Siberia back in the 1930s

30
00:00:58,831 --> 00:00:59,850
or whatever the fuck they invented.

31
00:00:59,851 --> 00:01:00,684
These things,

32
00:01:00,690 --> 00:01:03,810
what they are is it's like a cannon ball
with a big metal handle on it and you

33
00:01:03,811 --> 00:01:04,800
swing them around.

34
00:01:05,070 --> 00:01:05,661
And uh,

35
00:01:05,661 --> 00:01:05,950
in,

36
00:01:05,950 --> 00:01:08,160
in doing so and all
these various exercises,

37
00:01:08,161 --> 00:01:10,440
you develop what they
call functional strength,

38
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:13,020
meaning strength for your entire body,

39
00:01:13,021 --> 00:01:15,240
not isolated individual movements,

40
00:01:15,241 --> 00:01:17,100
but your entire body.

41
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:18,173
And uh,

42
00:01:18,270 --> 00:01:19,170
did they have no chimp?

43
00:01:19,171 --> 00:01:20,970
Where's the Chin and
say something's missing?

44
00:01:21,030 --> 00:01:23,010
The motherfuckers ran
out of chimps ran away.

45
00:01:23,810 --> 00:01:24,780
Now we must have run out.

46
00:01:25,950 --> 00:01:27,330
Those fucking things sell like crazy.

47
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:28,470
That's the primal bells.

48
00:01:28,471 --> 00:01:30,540
The primal bells are these
new kettle bells that we had.

49
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:32,370
This is the most important thing.

50
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:33,570
They look cool as shit.

51
00:01:33,700 --> 00:01:33,960
They're,

52
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:34,590
they're there.

53
00:01:34,590 --> 00:01:37,260
We have chimpanzees and
then we also have zombies.

54
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:38,730
We have a apes rather.

55
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:39,720
We also have zombies.

56
00:01:39,930 --> 00:01:40,621
But the,

57
00:01:40,621 --> 00:01:41,070
um,

58
00:01:41,070 --> 00:01:43,110
the most important things that
they don't just look good,

59
00:01:43,111 --> 00:01:44,850
but that they're three d mapped.

60
00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:47,850
What we have them is we
made sure that all of the,

61
00:01:47,851 --> 00:01:49,690
a kettle bells that you're getting there,

62
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:51,240
they're not imbalanced.

63
00:01:51,460 --> 00:01:52,800
You can make a cool face,

64
00:01:53,070 --> 00:01:54,960
but if the cool face wasn't balanced,

65
00:01:54,961 --> 00:01:56,930
it would kind of defeat the
purpose of the kettle bell.

66
00:01:57,180 --> 00:01:58,440
The whole idea about a kettle bells,

67
00:01:58,441 --> 00:02:00,990
it's gotta be balanced when you
move it so it looks bad ass,

68
00:02:00,991 --> 00:02:01,621
but you get a,

69
00:02:01,621 --> 00:02:02,670
like I use the uh,

70
00:02:02,671 --> 00:02:05,700
the gorilla and you get a
really good workout with it.

71
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:10,430
It doesn't feel at all like a gimmick
even when it slams into your arm with

72
00:02:10,460 --> 00:02:11,460
gorilla face first.

73
00:02:11,461 --> 00:02:12,294
If you're an idiot,

74
00:02:12,510 --> 00:02:14,800
if you're not paying attention
to how you swinging kettlebells,

75
00:02:15,330 --> 00:02:16,590
one thing that I can,

76
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:17,160
um,

77
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:20,280
really not stress enough
when it comes to this stuff.

78
00:02:20,310 --> 00:02:23,100
If you're thinking about doing
any kind of physical activity,

79
00:02:23,101 --> 00:02:24,480
if you've never worked out before,

80
00:02:25,050 --> 00:02:26,550
you've got to do two things.

81
00:02:26,551 --> 00:02:27,300
If you can,

82
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:27,940
the one thing,

83
00:02:27,940 --> 00:02:28,121
the,

84
00:02:28,121 --> 00:02:30,620
if you can part is hire
a personal trainer.

85
00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:32,100
Show you how to do the
movements correctly.

86
00:02:32,130 --> 00:02:32,520
Just,

87
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:32,790
you know,

88
00:02:32,790 --> 00:02:35,040
find out there's someone
will do it for you.

89
00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:38,240
Probably let you iPhone video it and let,

90
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:39,390
let someone you know,

91
00:02:39,391 --> 00:02:43,050
show you how to do like a clean and press,

92
00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:44,430
how to do a windmill.

93
00:02:44,431 --> 00:02:46,740
How to do these things
correctly and then videotape it.

94
00:02:46,741 --> 00:02:49,110
And then you could do it on your own and
you could literally never have to go to

95
00:02:49,111 --> 00:02:51,840
a gym again with a chin up bar
and a couple of kettle bells.

96
00:02:52,020 --> 00:02:54,840
Like you can get ferocious
workouts and on a daily basis,

97
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:56,910
but start slow.

98
00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:00,010
It's if you're a meathead
like me and in you're

99
00:03:00,010 --> 00:03:00,970
a dummy and you,

100
00:03:00,971 --> 00:03:02,500
if you know someone says,

101
00:03:02,501 --> 00:03:02,830
uh,

102
00:03:02,830 --> 00:03:04,360
take three vitamins you like hope said,

103
00:03:04,361 --> 00:03:04,731
fuck it,

104
00:03:04,731 --> 00:03:05,860
farm and see what's up,

105
00:03:07,930 --> 00:03:10,510
you could hurt yourself with
these things start slow.

106
00:03:10,511 --> 00:03:11,800
We have 35 pounders.

107
00:03:11,801 --> 00:03:13,030
We have 18 pounders,

108
00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:13,930
the howler monkeys,

109
00:03:13,931 --> 00:03:14,830
18 pounds.

110
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:15,760
And uh,

111
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:18,760
we go all the way up to 70
pounds with the primal bells.

112
00:03:18,761 --> 00:03:20,200
But if you're a real savage,

113
00:03:20,201 --> 00:03:22,210
one of those bonafide fitness freaks,

114
00:03:22,211 --> 00:03:23,300
like perhaps one of those cow,

115
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:25,540
those crossfit dudes who,

116
00:03:25,541 --> 00:03:25,930
uh,

117
00:03:25,930 --> 00:03:27,220
enter into those championships,

118
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:30,130
that bitch ass 70 pounds probably
not going to be enough for you.

119
00:03:30,430 --> 00:03:31,151
If that's the case,

120
00:03:31,151 --> 00:03:32,110
we sell him even heavier.

121
00:03:32,111 --> 00:03:33,640
The heaviest ones we sell,

122
00:03:34,270 --> 00:03:35,200
I don't know why they do them.

123
00:03:35,201 --> 00:03:36,040
And kilograms,

124
00:03:36,070 --> 00:03:39,250
I guess that's out of respect
to mother Russia or some shit.

125
00:03:40,630 --> 00:03:43,910
They all say kilogram foods anymore.

126
00:03:43,930 --> 00:03:44,420
Whatever that means.

127
00:03:44,420 --> 00:03:44,621
Yeah,

128
00:03:44,621 --> 00:03:45,580
we got rid of food,

129
00:03:45,610 --> 00:03:47,200
but it's now it's still in kilogram.

130
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:47,441
Okay.

131
00:03:47,441 --> 00:03:49,000
What the fuck is 40 kilograms?

132
00:03:49,001 --> 00:03:49,631
Let's find out.

133
00:03:49,631 --> 00:03:50,464
Let's tell people,

134
00:03:50,620 --> 00:03:52,180
I think it's 88 pounds.

135
00:03:53,230 --> 00:03:54,640
Let's see here that they would do that.

136
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:55,151
Yeah,

137
00:03:55,151 --> 00:03:57,370
it seems odd for Americans.

138
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,600
What is 40 kilograms and power?

139
00:03:59,620 --> 00:03:59,981
Yes,

140
00:03:59,981 --> 00:04:01,180
it's 88 pounds.

141
00:04:01,330 --> 00:04:02,650
So that's the heaviest one we have.

142
00:04:02,651 --> 00:04:04,910
If you could throw around
in 88 pound Kettlebell,

143
00:04:04,930 --> 00:04:06,450
you are some kind of man,

144
00:04:07,210 --> 00:04:07,920
Huh?

145
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:09,580
Everybody else starts slow,

146
00:04:09,610 --> 00:04:10,270
be healthy.

147
00:04:10,270 --> 00:04:11,051
And like I said,

148
00:04:11,051 --> 00:04:14,440
it's my favorite all time method
of just physical exercise.

149
00:04:14,441 --> 00:04:14,820
Just,

150
00:04:14,820 --> 00:04:15,030
you know,

151
00:04:15,030 --> 00:04:17,860
without martial arts being
the obvious number one,

152
00:04:18,070 --> 00:04:19,780
but just for regular exercise,

153
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:22,720
kettlebells are the
shit and it feels good.

154
00:04:22,810 --> 00:04:23,800
It feels good when you do them.

155
00:04:23,801 --> 00:04:24,071
It's just,

156
00:04:24,071 --> 00:04:24,904
it's like a,

157
00:04:24,970 --> 00:04:25,340
it's,

158
00:04:25,340 --> 00:04:25,840
it's,

159
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:28,010
you're stretching out a lot
and a lot of the moment.

160
00:04:28,011 --> 00:04:30,820
So it's got almost like a
yoga sort of a vibe to it.

161
00:04:30,821 --> 00:04:31,690
Like windmills,

162
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:32,591
windmills,

163
00:04:32,591 --> 00:04:35,890
or some of my favorite things to do with
super good for your core and your back

164
00:04:35,891 --> 00:04:36,340
and,

165
00:04:36,340 --> 00:04:36,970
but again,

166
00:04:36,970 --> 00:04:37,840
do them slow.

167
00:04:38,050 --> 00:04:38,590
And,

168
00:04:38,590 --> 00:04:38,921
uh,

169
00:04:38,921 --> 00:04:40,130
if you're interested in any of the audits,

170
00:04:40,150 --> 00:04:40,661
supplements,

171
00:04:40,661 --> 00:04:44,800
use the Codeword Rogan and you will
save 10% off any and all supplements.

172
00:04:44,830 --> 00:04:45,131
All right.

173
00:04:45,131 --> 00:04:46,570
Crash from the float lab is here,

174
00:04:46,571 --> 00:04:47,404
Ladies and gentlemen.

175
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:51,010
So without any further ado
and no more fuckery of foot,

176
00:04:51,910 --> 00:04:52,743
let's get rolling.

177
00:04:55,630 --> 00:04:55,810
Well,

178
00:04:55,810 --> 00:04:56,900
good experience.

179
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:01,060
[inaudible]

180
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:06,100
hey ladies and gentlemen,

181
00:05:06,101 --> 00:05:09,550
for many of you who've
heard this podcast before,

182
00:05:09,551 --> 00:05:13,510
you're aware of a thing that I'm really
into called the sensory deprivation

183
00:05:13,511 --> 00:05:14,344
tank.

184
00:05:14,620 --> 00:05:19,120
And the Sempra sensory deprivation tank
was invented by a guy named John Lilly

185
00:05:19,121 --> 00:05:21,310
who was a scientist and a real freak,

186
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:22,021
like a,

187
00:05:22,021 --> 00:05:23,950
a guy who is just really out there,

188
00:05:24,370 --> 00:05:25,570
really fascinating guy.

189
00:05:25,930 --> 00:05:27,130
And he wrote a book that,

190
00:05:27,131 --> 00:05:27,820
uh,

191
00:05:27,820 --> 00:05:28,960
I picked it up on,

192
00:05:29,260 --> 00:05:33,650
I think like amazon.com like the
used books that they'll sell young,

193
00:05:33,651 --> 00:05:34,091
like people,

194
00:05:34,091 --> 00:05:34,601
sellers,

195
00:05:34,601 --> 00:05:36,980
individual sellers are selling and it's a,

196
00:05:36,981 --> 00:05:37,900
the deep self.

197
00:05:38,290 --> 00:05:41,650
And in it he talks about
the benefits of the tank,

198
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:45,310
it detailed construction on
how to make your own tank.

199
00:05:45,311 --> 00:05:48,580
He's got like diagrams
in it and just really,

200
00:05:48,581 --> 00:05:49,870
really fascinating guy.

201
00:05:49,990 --> 00:05:54,910
And he was into all sorts of weird
altered states of consciousness.

202
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:58,610
And one of the things that he wanted
to figure out was how to separate

203
00:05:58,940 --> 00:06:00,560
the body from the senses.

204
00:06:01,370 --> 00:06:03,260
And he came up with a
bunch of different designs.

205
00:06:03,470 --> 00:06:07,310
There's a movie altered states
that's kind of very loosely based on,

206
00:06:07,340 --> 00:06:07,580
you know,

207
00:06:07,580 --> 00:06:12,580
the idea of a guy like him
going completely haywire
and becoming like a monkey.

208
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:17,300
Just that's how I got into
sensory deprivation tanks.

209
00:06:17,301 --> 00:06:19,260
I saw altered states and they,

210
00:06:19,261 --> 00:06:19,471
they,

211
00:06:19,471 --> 00:06:22,580
they were historically fairly
accurate in the design of the tanks.

212
00:06:22,581 --> 00:06:26,540
The initial one that you saw in altered
states showed what lily at first came up

213
00:06:26,541 --> 00:06:26,721
with,

214
00:06:26,721 --> 00:06:31,721
which was like a glass scuba helmet that
sort of suspended them in regular water

215
00:06:33,050 --> 00:06:33,630
and uh,

216
00:06:33,630 --> 00:06:35,720
he would actually Poop and pee into it.

217
00:06:36,050 --> 00:06:40,400
He had like some crazy filtration system
so he could stay in there and not have

218
00:06:40,401 --> 00:06:41,690
to defecate or urinate.

219
00:06:41,691 --> 00:06:43,730
So it would go through some
system that he had created.

220
00:06:44,380 --> 00:06:44,600
I mean,

221
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:45,433
this dude was gone.

222
00:06:45,950 --> 00:06:47,000
He was off the deep end.

223
00:06:47,300 --> 00:06:49,140
I mean he's about as off the deep as,

224
00:06:49,170 --> 00:06:49,671
as ever.

225
00:06:49,671 --> 00:06:50,690
But his,

226
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:55,720
his big thing was to try to figure out
how you can get the mind free of the

227
00:06:56,151 --> 00:06:57,260
influence of the body.

228
00:06:57,620 --> 00:07:02,420
And the best method he came up
to was this idea of the tank.

229
00:07:02,630 --> 00:07:07,190
And he figured out eventually to put salt
water in it and that if you put enough

230
00:07:07,191 --> 00:07:07,911
absence salts,

231
00:07:07,911 --> 00:07:10,520
your body would float and
then he could maintain the,

232
00:07:10,550 --> 00:07:15,120
the heating temperature to essentially
what's the same temperature is just

233
00:07:15,130 --> 00:07:19,040
surface your skin and you wouldn't be
able to recognize where the water was and

234
00:07:19,041 --> 00:07:23,240
it would give you the sensation
of complete sensory deprivation.

235
00:07:24,470 --> 00:07:26,660
And he figured this out.

236
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:30,710
And from that point on til like,

237
00:07:30,770 --> 00:07:31,191
God,

238
00:07:31,191 --> 00:07:32,024
I don't mean

239
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:35,660
I met you in,

240
00:07:35,810 --> 00:07:37,420
what was it like how many years ago?

241
00:07:37,421 --> 00:07:39,470
Is it a five or six?

242
00:07:39,470 --> 00:07:40,580
Probably five or six years ago.

243
00:07:40,610 --> 00:07:41,151
Before that,

244
00:07:41,151 --> 00:07:42,950
I had that other gentlemen who,

245
00:07:42,951 --> 00:07:43,160
uh,

246
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:47,300
used to repair tanks for somebody
who's a great guy and he,

247
00:07:47,301 --> 00:07:49,160
he told me about you and,

248
00:07:49,161 --> 00:07:49,250
uh,

249
00:07:49,250 --> 00:07:51,730
the guy was fixing my Samadi
tank and my somebody tank,

250
00:07:51,731 --> 00:07:53,180
it fucked up something,

251
00:07:53,420 --> 00:07:53,781
something.

252
00:07:53,781 --> 00:07:55,610
It wasn't the tank to
fucked up was the heater,

253
00:07:55,611 --> 00:07:57,320
like it burnt through the,

254
00:07:57,321 --> 00:07:57,471
uh,

255
00:07:57,471 --> 00:08:01,590
the lining of the waterbed and
it's shorted out the whole thing.

256
00:08:01,591 --> 00:08:02,450
It was a disaster.

257
00:08:02,660 --> 00:08:04,150
Like sometimes those
heating yell messages,

258
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:05,273
they'll pop,

259
00:08:05,570 --> 00:08:05,901
you know,

260
00:08:05,901 --> 00:08:09,500
for whatever reason there's the cook
and it just melted a hole through the

261
00:08:09,501 --> 00:08:09,711
thing.

262
00:08:09,711 --> 00:08:10,550
So he had to repair it,

263
00:08:10,551 --> 00:08:13,250
he to repair the lining and
while he's repairing the lining,

264
00:08:13,251 --> 00:08:13,581
he goes,

265
00:08:13,581 --> 00:08:13,821
you know,

266
00:08:13,821 --> 00:08:18,821
there's this guy in Venice that makes
these like really high tech tanks and he

267
00:08:19,821 --> 00:08:20,061
goes,

268
00:08:20,061 --> 00:08:21,290
you should contact him.

269
00:08:21,291 --> 00:08:22,160
His name is crash.

270
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:23,600
She's kind of an interesting guy.

271
00:08:24,260 --> 00:08:24,861
And so,

272
00:08:24,861 --> 00:08:25,694
uh,

273
00:08:26,180 --> 00:08:28,220
I s I asked him about it and uh,

274
00:08:28,250 --> 00:08:32,390
he went into depth about all the crazy
shit that you had done to these tanks and

275
00:08:32,391 --> 00:08:33,061
what they looked like.

276
00:08:33,061 --> 00:08:34,740
And he sent me to your
website and I saw the train.

277
00:08:34,741 --> 00:08:36,740
And this is pre the standup tanks.

278
00:08:36,920 --> 00:08:40,250
They were still like smaller like um,

279
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:41,480
ones like Samadhi.

280
00:08:41,481 --> 00:08:44,510
But way better constructed you,

281
00:08:44,511 --> 00:08:47,330
you had figured out how to do
it where it was just like this,

282
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:49,100
it looks like a meat locker.

283
00:08:49,340 --> 00:08:53,900
I mean it's so solid and well built and
all your crazy filtration system and

284
00:08:53,901 --> 00:08:54,171
everything.

285
00:08:54,171 --> 00:08:59,171
And I realized that you were this one
lone dude out there who's innovating and

286
00:09:00,301 --> 00:09:02,580
it's sort of forgotten business.

287
00:09:02,820 --> 00:09:05,550
This sort of forgotten aspect of uh,

288
00:09:06,030 --> 00:09:06,863
of,

289
00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:07,360
uh,

290
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:09,870
of modern day understanding of the mind.

291
00:09:10,350 --> 00:09:11,011
I mean it's really,

292
00:09:11,011 --> 00:09:12,930
it was ignored somehow or another.

293
00:09:12,930 --> 00:09:14,040
I don't know what happened.

294
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:18,720
I don't know how all these scientists
and geniuses missed out on the sensory

295
00:09:18,721 --> 00:09:20,160
deprivation tank promotion.

296
00:09:20,340 --> 00:09:22,800
They should have been
talking about it everywhere.

297
00:09:22,830 --> 00:09:27,830
It is a mind blowing evolution in,

298
00:09:27,981 --> 00:09:29,040
in meditation.

299
00:09:29,190 --> 00:09:33,480
It's a mind blowing next step in
meditation where you instantaneously go.

300
00:09:34,020 --> 00:09:36,030
If you get good enough at it
and you do it long enough,

301
00:09:36,031 --> 00:09:38,520
you instantaneously can
go to psychedelic states,

302
00:09:38,580 --> 00:09:41,040
intense introspective,

303
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:41,791
objective,

304
00:09:41,791 --> 00:09:43,470
psychedelic states that are there.

305
00:09:43,530 --> 00:09:43,791
They,

306
00:09:43,791 --> 00:09:44,160
they,

307
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:45,510
they change your life.

308
00:09:45,690 --> 00:09:48,150
They fundamentally changed
the way you think about life.

309
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:52,080
And the fact that these people aren't
promoting this because it's not a drug,

310
00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:52,260
it's,

311
00:09:52,260 --> 00:09:53,730
it's totally safe.

312
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:55,560
It's totally easy to acquire.

313
00:09:55,830 --> 00:09:56,221
It's,

314
00:09:56,221 --> 00:09:57,120
it's totally,

315
00:09:57,150 --> 00:09:57,460
uh,

316
00:09:57,460 --> 00:09:57,600
it,

317
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:57,800
it,

318
00:09:57,800 --> 00:09:58,531
it ends.

319
00:09:58,531 --> 00:09:59,400
Anytime you want,

320
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:01,470
you open the door to
get out and it's over.

321
00:10:01,650 --> 00:10:03,240
There's no repercussions.

322
00:10:03,241 --> 00:10:04,320
There's no weirdness to it.

323
00:10:04,470 --> 00:10:08,700
You instantaneously drift back into
normal consciousness that no one's talking

324
00:10:08,701 --> 00:10:09,240
about it.

325
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:09,980
No one was doing.

326
00:10:09,980 --> 00:10:10,321
And I,

327
00:10:10,321 --> 00:10:15,030
and I found you and Brian
created this a video.

328
00:10:15,450 --> 00:10:19,750
Brian was the guy who made that video
where we went down to the basement and

329
00:10:19,790 --> 00:10:20,720
videotape the,

330
00:10:20,721 --> 00:10:20,871
uh,

331
00:10:20,871 --> 00:10:21,704
the tank.

332
00:10:21,870 --> 00:10:22,291
And,

333
00:10:22,291 --> 00:10:22,650
uh,

334
00:10:22,650 --> 00:10:23,070
from,

335
00:10:23,070 --> 00:10:24,360
from that video on,

336
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:29,910
we started hearing more and more
people opening up the centers.

337
00:10:29,911 --> 00:10:30,900
They started going crazy.

338
00:10:30,901 --> 00:10:34,020
They started opening up all over the
place and you continue to innovate.

339
00:10:34,350 --> 00:10:35,430
And you haven't said a word yet,

340
00:10:35,431 --> 00:10:35,841
by the way of,

341
00:10:35,841 --> 00:10:36,430
you know.

342
00:10:36,430 --> 00:10:36,641
Well,

343
00:10:36,641 --> 00:10:36,821
no,

344
00:10:36,821 --> 00:10:37,060
I,

345
00:10:37,060 --> 00:10:37,920
even after I'm here,

346
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:38,740
I,

347
00:10:38,740 --> 00:10:40,030
I'm just nodding my head.

348
00:10:40,031 --> 00:10:40,420
I mean,

349
00:10:40,420 --> 00:10:42,100
you're doing such a good job at the,

350
00:10:42,101 --> 00:10:42,340
uh,

351
00:10:42,340 --> 00:10:44,320
at your appraisal of the situation that,

352
00:10:44,321 --> 00:10:45,154
uh,

353
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:45,461
you know,

354
00:10:45,461 --> 00:10:46,840
I don't want to dilute it.

355
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:47,220
No,

356
00:10:47,220 --> 00:10:47,440
I,

357
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:49,750
I just feel like I'm not at all,

358
00:10:49,780 --> 00:10:50,290
no,

359
00:10:50,290 --> 00:10:53,710
I'm really enjoying this because
you are the guy that six years ago,

360
00:10:53,711 --> 00:10:56,140
whatever it was that
first understood that too.

361
00:10:56,500 --> 00:10:58,090
Not only was I out there,

362
00:10:58,250 --> 00:10:58,580
you know,

363
00:10:58,580 --> 00:11:00,010
kinda standing around by myself,

364
00:11:00,011 --> 00:11:01,480
but you know,

365
00:11:02,070 --> 00:11:02,741
when I,

366
00:11:02,741 --> 00:11:03,700
when I found you,

367
00:11:03,701 --> 00:11:07,600
then that really escalated
the exposure in general,

368
00:11:07,790 --> 00:11:12,040
not just isn't for me or it has
to do with the industry overall.

369
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:13,170
Once that,

370
00:11:13,170 --> 00:11:13,530
you know,

371
00:11:13,530 --> 00:11:14,363
you became,

372
00:11:14,380 --> 00:11:15,011
because you're,

373
00:11:15,011 --> 00:11:17,260
you're an honest guy and your opinion,

374
00:11:17,350 --> 00:11:18,730
people trust it.

375
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:19,531
And,

376
00:11:19,531 --> 00:11:21,250
and when you say something then that,

377
00:11:21,251 --> 00:11:22,084
uh,

378
00:11:22,210 --> 00:11:23,950
it has a value.

379
00:11:24,340 --> 00:11:24,870
You know,

380
00:11:24,870 --> 00:11:26,010
there's other been people say,

381
00:11:26,030 --> 00:11:26,291
oh,

382
00:11:26,291 --> 00:11:26,471
this,

383
00:11:26,471 --> 00:11:27,304
that whatever,

384
00:11:27,830 --> 00:11:28,780
it doesn't have that,

385
00:11:28,781 --> 00:11:30,040
that sincerity.

386
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:30,873
The uh,

387
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:31,631
the true,

388
00:11:31,631 --> 00:11:32,464
uh,

389
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:32,921
you know,

390
00:11:32,921 --> 00:11:33,250
from,

391
00:11:33,250 --> 00:11:33,630
from,

392
00:11:33,630 --> 00:11:33,850
uh,

393
00:11:33,850 --> 00:11:35,290
what you believe type thing.

394
00:11:35,291 --> 00:11:37,630
It's a lot of times
influenced by this or that.

395
00:11:38,170 --> 00:11:39,140
But once you,

396
00:11:39,190 --> 00:11:39,600
you know,

397
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:39,770
and,

398
00:11:39,770 --> 00:11:40,391
and you've been,

399
00:11:40,391 --> 00:11:40,781
like I say,

400
00:11:40,781 --> 00:11:44,620
even with the device thing was a big
thing with this in the Hamilton Morris.

401
00:11:44,621 --> 00:11:45,220
It was great.

402
00:11:45,220 --> 00:11:45,881
He's credible.

403
00:11:45,881 --> 00:11:46,571
And without you,

404
00:11:46,571 --> 00:11:47,560
that wouldn't have happened.

405
00:11:47,620 --> 00:11:48,130
You know,

406
00:11:48,130 --> 00:11:52,060
it's just a in that these things help
out everybody right now because the

407
00:11:52,061 --> 00:11:53,940
industry deserves a,

408
00:11:53,941 --> 00:11:55,750
a opportunity to,

409
00:11:55,751 --> 00:11:56,260
uh,

410
00:11:56,260 --> 00:12:01,260
to expand and become available to people
in general because it is an important

411
00:12:02,021 --> 00:12:06,700
thing to a person that's in the process
of considering what it is that they're

412
00:12:06,701 --> 00:12:07,750
doing with themselves,

413
00:12:07,810 --> 00:12:08,050
when,

414
00:12:08,050 --> 00:12:10,630
which I think is very
important for people to,

415
00:12:10,631 --> 00:12:11,464
uh,

416
00:12:11,620 --> 00:12:14,050
take responsibility for
their actions and what,

417
00:12:14,060 --> 00:12:14,311
what,

418
00:12:14,311 --> 00:12:14,680
what,

419
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:16,180
what they do and what they say.

420
00:12:16,181 --> 00:12:16,701
Cause you know,

421
00:12:16,701 --> 00:12:17,200
you,

422
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:17,771
you can,

423
00:12:17,771 --> 00:12:18,370
uh,

424
00:12:18,370 --> 00:12:19,390
you're free to do that.

425
00:12:19,390 --> 00:12:19,541
You know,

426
00:12:19,541 --> 00:12:19,781
you're,

427
00:12:19,781 --> 00:12:21,220
you're allowed to be different.

428
00:12:21,250 --> 00:12:22,720
You're allowed to go ahead and say,

429
00:12:22,721 --> 00:12:23,554
you know what?

430
00:12:23,830 --> 00:12:26,290
I don't think this is
quite the way that I,

431
00:12:26,291 --> 00:12:26,650
you know,

432
00:12:26,650 --> 00:12:29,530
in the vista becoming
actually more popular now.

433
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:32,650
This is like freaky people
that are able to go out say,

434
00:12:32,651 --> 00:12:33,101
oh well hey,

435
00:12:33,101 --> 00:12:33,551
maybe that,

436
00:12:33,551 --> 00:12:33,911
and they're going,

437
00:12:33,911 --> 00:12:34,600
oh yeah,

438
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:35,710
they're doing all kinds of weird stuff.

439
00:12:35,950 --> 00:12:38,080
I don't even know what a Palati is.

440
00:12:39,190 --> 00:12:40,120
It's catching on,

441
00:12:40,121 --> 00:12:40,301
you know,

442
00:12:40,301 --> 00:12:40,450
there,

443
00:12:40,450 --> 00:12:40,860
I,

444
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:41,200
I,

445
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:41,740
you,

446
00:12:41,740 --> 00:12:43,230
I don't know if it's
just our neighborhood or,

447
00:12:43,231 --> 00:12:43,341
right.

448
00:12:43,341 --> 00:12:44,380
It is a labor there.

449
00:12:44,610 --> 00:12:49,330
The different yogas spinning all
these different activities that,

450
00:12:49,331 --> 00:12:49,661
that,

451
00:12:49,661 --> 00:12:50,230
that are,

452
00:12:50,230 --> 00:12:55,230
that people do in a lot of the crossover
to currently it's based on these

453
00:12:55,421 --> 00:12:56,840
athletes that,

454
00:12:56,860 --> 00:13:00,550
that you have contact with or that
respect your perspective or whatever.

455
00:13:00,551 --> 00:13:01,384
And they show up.

456
00:13:01,390 --> 00:13:04,300
That Guy Jeremy Stevens was
here the other day again.

457
00:13:04,460 --> 00:13:04,990
Yeah.

458
00:13:04,990 --> 00:13:07,450
And then I watched him on a clip.

459
00:13:07,750 --> 00:13:08,531
I don't know when that is.

460
00:13:08,531 --> 00:13:09,100
What was fun?

461
00:13:09,100 --> 00:13:11,700
It was this past week that when
he got that guy down fight,

462
00:13:11,770 --> 00:13:12,900
he kicked him and then no,

463
00:13:12,901 --> 00:13:12,981
no,

464
00:13:12,981 --> 00:13:13,121
no.

465
00:13:13,121 --> 00:13:15,260
That was a knock out that he
had in the previous fight.

466
00:13:15,290 --> 00:13:16,000
Man.

467
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,380
I just saw that the other day.

468
00:13:17,381 --> 00:13:17,950
He,

469
00:13:17,950 --> 00:13:18,520
he uh,

470
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:19,260
he uh,

471
00:13:19,260 --> 00:13:20,560
did you guys that was in Brazil.

472
00:13:20,790 --> 00:13:21,220
Yeah.

473
00:13:21,220 --> 00:13:22,053
Incredible.

474
00:13:23,300 --> 00:13:23,720
Yeah.

475
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:24,500
Great Guy.

476
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:25,940
All those guys smart too.

477
00:13:26,030 --> 00:13:26,840
Oh yeah,

478
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:27,380
no.

479
00:13:27,380 --> 00:13:30,070
A lot of those guys who were
surprisingly nice and surprising.

480
00:13:30,090 --> 00:13:30,470
Smart.

481
00:13:30,470 --> 00:13:34,340
I think a lot of people have this idea
about people that are involved in combat

482
00:13:34,341 --> 00:13:36,350
sports that they're mean
or they're assholes.

483
00:13:36,420 --> 00:13:37,620
Quite the contrary,

484
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:40,980
I find you'd be some of the most level,

485
00:13:41,070 --> 00:13:41,903
uh,

486
00:13:41,910 --> 00:13:44,100
well adjusted people that
come in contact with.

487
00:13:44,101 --> 00:13:47,130
They're not trying to prove anything
because they're already secure with who

488
00:13:47,131 --> 00:13:47,964
they are.

489
00:13:48,100 --> 00:13:48,341
Yeah,

490
00:13:48,341 --> 00:13:49,390
they're more level.

491
00:13:49,391 --> 00:13:51,010
That's the best way of of putting it.

492
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:55,540
Like cause you're forced to get your
ego checked on a super regular basis and

493
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:57,050
when that happens you kind of,

494
00:13:57,540 --> 00:13:59,110
you just have a better view of things,

495
00:13:59,111 --> 00:13:59,944
you know you don't,

496
00:14:00,730 --> 00:14:03,580
people were constantly afraid of
losing and when you're a fighter,

497
00:14:03,581 --> 00:14:07,600
you lose in the gym all the time
and you kind of mellow that out.

498
00:14:07,630 --> 00:14:09,670
You get an understanding
of who you are and you,

499
00:14:09,700 --> 00:14:12,910
and also the blowing off
of the energy in the gym.

500
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:13,471
You just see,

501
00:14:13,471 --> 00:14:14,350
feel so much better.

502
00:14:14,351 --> 00:14:15,250
You're more chill,

503
00:14:15,370 --> 00:14:16,630
more relaxed about stuff.

504
00:14:16,900 --> 00:14:17,920
Like a lot of people,

505
00:14:18,430 --> 00:14:20,820
a lot of what their stress
is is that their bodies,

506
00:14:20,830 --> 00:14:21,663
a battery,

507
00:14:21,700 --> 00:14:24,670
their bodies building up all this energy
and it never gets exerted until you're

508
00:14:24,671 --> 00:14:25,900
taken in all this food.

509
00:14:26,250 --> 00:14:26,500
You're,

510
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:28,210
you're sitting in a cubicle,

511
00:14:28,211 --> 00:14:29,710
you're sitting in your car,

512
00:14:29,711 --> 00:14:31,090
you're sitting at the movies,

513
00:14:31,091 --> 00:14:34,540
you are constantly sitting and not
doing anything and he just irritable.

514
00:14:34,660 --> 00:14:36,940
You're body's just trying to fuck dude,

515
00:14:36,941 --> 00:14:38,140
you fucking move.

516
00:14:38,230 --> 00:14:39,310
Get something going.

517
00:14:39,311 --> 00:14:40,144
Come on,

518
00:14:40,180 --> 00:14:42,730
we've got all this shit pent up and
then someone would get in front of your

519
00:14:42,731 --> 00:14:43,564
traffic.

520
00:14:44,610 --> 00:14:44,920
You know,

521
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:46,660
when people wonder where
that's coming from,

522
00:14:46,661 --> 00:14:47,670
well that's coming from your,

523
00:14:47,671 --> 00:14:49,120
your all backed up.

524
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:49,961
You know,

525
00:14:49,961 --> 00:14:50,221
you're,

526
00:14:50,221 --> 00:14:51,054
you are backed.

527
00:14:51,230 --> 00:14:54,470
I know there's nothing scientific
whatsoever to what a trigger is short on.

528
00:14:54,471 --> 00:14:55,041
Some of us,

529
00:14:55,041 --> 00:14:55,580
you know,

530
00:14:55,580 --> 00:14:56,360
pretty uh,

531
00:14:56,360 --> 00:14:56,961
it's also,

532
00:14:56,961 --> 00:14:57,231
you know,

533
00:14:57,231 --> 00:14:59,870
you're not getting your endorphins
and kind of calm you down.

534
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:05,080
And I think that the tank represents a
level of that in some way that I think

535
00:15:05,541 --> 00:15:06,330
that it's,

536
00:15:06,330 --> 00:15:10,850
it's a thing that should not
just be something that people,

537
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:15,770
it becomes popular but po something
that it becomes popular in,

538
00:15:15,771 --> 00:15:18,650
in a way where people get a chance to,

539
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:21,770
to do a new thing that they
could get excited about.

540
00:15:21,770 --> 00:15:24,560
Which is one of the things that
people like with like pilates or yoga,

541
00:15:24,770 --> 00:15:28,340
a new thing that they could be excited
about that could benefit them mentally,

542
00:15:28,910 --> 00:15:31,940
which is where I think we were
missing out on a lot of this stuff.

543
00:15:31,941 --> 00:15:33,920
I think yoga does benefit you mentally.

544
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:37,010
I think it calms you down and
it's very good for you physically.

545
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:41,690
But the physical aspect of the
mental aspect coincide with the tank.

546
00:15:41,691 --> 00:15:42,920
It's a hundred percent mental,

547
00:15:43,130 --> 00:15:44,000
it's a weird,

548
00:15:44,001 --> 00:15:45,080
weird experience.

549
00:15:45,100 --> 00:15:49,010
Plus it's available for it for a human
being to actually participate in this

550
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:52,850
meditation where you sit in a room with
your legs crossed and you're supposed to

551
00:15:52,851 --> 00:15:53,840
check out somehow.

552
00:15:54,140 --> 00:15:54,560
I can't,

553
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:55,700
I can't do that,

554
00:15:55,701 --> 00:15:59,510
but I go sit in that box for a couple of
few hours and go all kinds of different

555
00:15:59,511 --> 00:15:59,830
things.

556
00:15:59,830 --> 00:16:00,000
Well,

557
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,570
you know the beditation is possible.

558
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:04,010
I know that there's people that do that,

559
00:16:04,011 --> 00:16:07,910
Kundalini Yoga and they have these
intense psychedelic visions and I believe

560
00:16:07,911 --> 00:16:09,980
that 100% because you,

561
00:16:09,981 --> 00:16:10,400
you,

562
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:15,020
you do have indogenous chemicals that
the brain produces that can give you

563
00:16:15,021 --> 00:16:18,750
psychedelic experiences like we know
about diamond field trip to me and,

564
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:20,120
and we know about five minute thoughts.

565
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:22,850
He'd die muscle the trip to me
being produced by the human body.

566
00:16:23,150 --> 00:16:24,740
So if those are being
produced by the body,

567
00:16:24,890 --> 00:16:29,870
this could easily be some ancient
method of stimulating that production of

568
00:16:29,871 --> 00:16:32,750
releasing some sort of a
burst of that production.

569
00:16:33,140 --> 00:16:35,540
And so these super coon Delaney masters,

570
00:16:35,780 --> 00:16:37,850
which seems like it would be
something you would want to do,

571
00:16:37,851 --> 00:16:38,840
but for whatever reason,

572
00:16:38,841 --> 00:16:39,674
I'm not compelled.

573
00:16:40,140 --> 00:16:40,830
She Shit,

574
00:16:40,830 --> 00:16:42,230
I'm not compelled enough to learn it,

575
00:16:42,410 --> 00:16:46,610
but they can experience natural DMT
trips at the highest levels of their art

576
00:16:46,611 --> 00:16:47,444
form,

577
00:16:47,450 --> 00:16:48,283
which I believe,

578
00:16:48,380 --> 00:16:50,360
I think you just got to get
really good at sitting there.

579
00:16:50,620 --> 00:16:52,970
Then you just get a really
good at yoga positions.

580
00:16:52,971 --> 00:16:54,800
You got to get really good at meditating.

581
00:16:54,940 --> 00:16:59,330
They got to get really good
at just getting good enough
at yoga physically that

582
00:16:59,331 --> 00:17:01,520
you could just sort of
fallen into these forms.

583
00:17:01,820 --> 00:17:05,150
And then when you're falling into these
forms and supporting yourself in some

584
00:17:05,151 --> 00:17:06,020
way by,

585
00:17:06,080 --> 00:17:08,570
by making your body work like that,

586
00:17:08,571 --> 00:17:13,571
you like heightened your expression to
whatever it is that yoga is trying to tap

587
00:17:13,731 --> 00:17:14,091
into.

588
00:17:14,091 --> 00:17:17,240
And it's very psychedelic
but still not the tank.

589
00:17:18,110 --> 00:17:21,020
And it's difficult for me because I'm too,

590
00:17:21,021 --> 00:17:21,470
uh,

591
00:17:21,470 --> 00:17:22,320
too wound up to,

592
00:17:22,340 --> 00:17:24,200
I can't sit somewhere and just sit there.

593
00:17:24,230 --> 00:17:24,371
But,

594
00:17:24,371 --> 00:17:25,340
but if you tried,

595
00:17:25,460 --> 00:17:27,170
maybe you could force yourself.

596
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:27,321
Yeah,

597
00:17:27,321 --> 00:17:28,400
it would have to force me,

598
00:17:28,460 --> 00:17:28,711
you know?

599
00:17:28,711 --> 00:17:29,544
And I suppose,

600
00:17:29,590 --> 00:17:32,390
do you think that would be good
for you to force yourself to that?

601
00:17:32,740 --> 00:17:33,501
I don't have the,

602
00:17:33,501 --> 00:17:33,840
uh,

603
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:34,400
the,

604
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:35,240
it's just not in my,

605
00:17:35,241 --> 00:17:35,810
uh,

606
00:17:35,810 --> 00:17:35,991
my,

607
00:17:35,991 --> 00:17:38,210
another way that I operate,

608
00:17:38,211 --> 00:17:38,631
you know what I mean?

609
00:17:38,631 --> 00:17:39,350
I have a operating,

610
00:17:39,350 --> 00:17:40,100
when I'm awake,

611
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:41,000
I'm looking at like,

612
00:17:41,001 --> 00:17:43,700
even when I'm out snowboarding
or they're riding my,

613
00:17:43,810 --> 00:17:44,420
whatever,

614
00:17:44,420 --> 00:17:45,253
I don't wear the,

615
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:47,420
your earphones or whatever,

616
00:17:47,450 --> 00:17:48,110
if I'm right,

617
00:17:48,110 --> 00:17:49,680
I need to listen to what's happening.

618
00:17:49,681 --> 00:17:49,980
Man's

619
00:17:49,980 --> 00:17:50,910
all like all the time.

620
00:17:50,911 --> 00:17:53,190
So it's so distractive,

621
00:17:53,220 --> 00:17:54,053
uh,

622
00:17:54,060 --> 00:17:54,810
in general,

623
00:17:54,810 --> 00:17:59,190
but in their cuts everything off and
I go straight into my head and there's

624
00:17:59,191 --> 00:18:00,870
nothing else there except for that.

625
00:18:00,900 --> 00:18:01,670
I see what you're saying.

626
00:18:01,670 --> 00:18:02,630
Two about the physical.

627
00:18:02,631 --> 00:18:06,530
For some folks they just did not
interested in doing anything that's really

628
00:18:06,531 --> 00:18:08,120
physically strenuous.

629
00:18:08,150 --> 00:18:09,380
I totally understand that.

630
00:18:09,590 --> 00:18:12,230
And that energy winds up being,

631
00:18:12,231 --> 00:18:13,910
they distribute that energy to their work.

632
00:18:13,911 --> 00:18:14,481
Like you do.

633
00:18:14,481 --> 00:18:15,590
Like you're kind of a,

634
00:18:15,890 --> 00:18:20,660
just a mad fiend with your work and your
constant improvements and innovations

635
00:18:20,661 --> 00:18:21,321
to all this stuff.

636
00:18:21,321 --> 00:18:22,010
Like,

637
00:18:22,010 --> 00:18:22,281
you know,

638
00:18:22,281 --> 00:18:26,330
your energy goes where your
energy is probably best suited.

639
00:18:26,750 --> 00:18:27,051
You know,

640
00:18:27,051 --> 00:18:27,201
it's,

641
00:18:27,201 --> 00:18:28,400
it's not the same for everybody.

642
00:18:28,490 --> 00:18:29,260
So what I'm trying to say,

643
00:18:29,260 --> 00:18:30,780
some people have extra time or they're,

644
00:18:30,781 --> 00:18:34,730
they're in the process or a
pursuit and that's a viable,

645
00:18:34,740 --> 00:18:35,190
uh,

646
00:18:35,190 --> 00:18:35,650
uh,

647
00:18:35,650 --> 00:18:36,700
method of expression.

648
00:18:36,730 --> 00:18:38,560
That's a good way to meet
chicks with nice legs.

649
00:18:38,561 --> 00:18:42,640
That's what I think [inaudible]
probably the most advantageous.

650
00:18:44,170 --> 00:18:44,760
Otherwise,

651
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:45,610
why are they going,

652
00:18:45,611 --> 00:18:47,940
where's a beaker of yoga where
it's all sweaty there and there,

653
00:18:47,941 --> 00:18:49,150
there's a 400 degrees and you go,

654
00:18:49,180 --> 00:18:49,511
Oh wow,

655
00:18:49,511 --> 00:18:50,410
this is a lot of fun.

656
00:18:51,100 --> 00:18:52,900
Having sex with a room full of people,

657
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:54,370
you know,

658
00:18:54,370 --> 00:18:54,880
it's like,

659
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:56,320
it's the strangest thing ever.

660
00:18:56,380 --> 00:18:59,890
And I see with all these things in mind
that the chamber doesn't sound so bad.

661
00:18:59,891 --> 00:19:00,724
You know what I'm saying?

662
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:01,530
Hey,

663
00:19:01,530 --> 00:19:04,570
just go in this thing and lay down there
and all of a sudden you'll have the

664
00:19:04,571 --> 00:19:06,670
ability to tap into yourself.

665
00:19:06,700 --> 00:19:07,421
I liked both,

666
00:19:07,421 --> 00:19:07,680
man.

667
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:09,280
I really do like doing yoga.

668
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:10,810
We let you go a pump up.

669
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:12,040
I'm going to get me one of those.

670
00:19:12,041 --> 00:19:12,940
A gorilla,

671
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:13,631
a couple of those.

672
00:19:13,631 --> 00:19:14,450
A catalog.

673
00:19:14,450 --> 00:19:14,950
I was it.

674
00:19:14,950 --> 00:19:15,660
Yeah.

675
00:19:15,660 --> 00:19:18,910
I like all what you just had to
say about that starts small though.

676
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:19,740
Yeah,

677
00:19:19,740 --> 00:19:22,570
I can get a baby gorilla or
something to do any exercises.

678
00:19:22,630 --> 00:19:23,463
No nothing.

679
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:24,130
Nope.

680
00:19:24,130 --> 00:19:25,360
I go up and down the stairs.

681
00:19:25,420 --> 00:19:26,253
That works.

682
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:27,130
That's something.

683
00:19:27,130 --> 00:19:27,520
Yeah.

684
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:30,150
And I walk and that is a decision that

685
00:19:30,250 --> 00:19:31,360
people don't realize.

686
00:19:31,361 --> 00:19:33,700
Like if you get to the airport
and every time there's a stairway,

687
00:19:33,910 --> 00:19:35,230
he forced herself to take the stairway.

688
00:19:35,231 --> 00:19:36,310
Every time there's,

689
00:19:36,340 --> 00:19:37,060
you know,

690
00:19:37,060 --> 00:19:40,240
escalator or you avoid that
and get the stares that just,

691
00:19:40,241 --> 00:19:42,910
that alone will make your
trip just slightly better.

692
00:19:43,170 --> 00:19:43,411
Yeah.

693
00:19:43,411 --> 00:19:44,980
Just get a little blood flow in your body.

694
00:19:44,981 --> 00:19:46,320
I that triple sonic too.

695
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:47,081
Do you ever get on here?

696
00:19:47,081 --> 00:19:47,341
Yeah.

697
00:19:47,341 --> 00:19:47,551
Yeah,

698
00:19:47,551 --> 00:19:48,210
I got that.

699
00:19:48,210 --> 00:19:48,480
Yeah.

700
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:49,120
I got it from you.

701
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:49,953
That's fine.

702
00:19:50,100 --> 00:19:51,770
I got on that once in a while
cause I don't like that.

703
00:19:51,771 --> 00:19:52,900
That donut top was there.

704
00:19:52,990 --> 00:19:53,611
The muffin,

705
00:19:53,611 --> 00:19:54,900
a muffin top.

706
00:19:55,170 --> 00:19:58,290
I don't like to have that thing so
I gotta make helps you lose weight.

707
00:19:58,530 --> 00:19:59,190
It'll get,

708
00:19:59,190 --> 00:19:59,851
I don't do it,

709
00:19:59,851 --> 00:20:03,960
you know too much for my stomach sit
ups or something like this to try to get

710
00:20:03,961 --> 00:20:05,550
that from a collecting down there.

711
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,200
But standing on that thing,

712
00:20:07,230 --> 00:20:08,400
it kind of helps,

713
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:12,450
I think at least psychologically believe
it's something undoing for exercise.

714
00:20:12,570 --> 00:20:16,350
Wasn't that thing invented for Russian
cosmonauts to keep them in orbit?

715
00:20:16,770 --> 00:20:16,981
Yeah,

716
00:20:16,981 --> 00:20:18,190
I think that they were uh,

717
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:23,300
having issues with a muscle deterioration
and the atrophy or whatever.

718
00:20:24,690 --> 00:20:25,201
So they,

719
00:20:25,201 --> 00:20:25,530
uh,

720
00:20:25,530 --> 00:20:29,310
I guess incorporated this a
system of vibration into the,

721
00:20:29,311 --> 00:20:32,610
a strengthening of their
muscles apparently,

722
00:20:32,790 --> 00:20:33,960
but I don't really know.

723
00:20:34,220 --> 00:20:35,100
It seems like,

724
00:20:35,101 --> 00:20:36,060
well where did they take it?

725
00:20:36,061 --> 00:20:39,390
Did they take it up in the ship with
'em or whether it's a good question,

726
00:20:39,420 --> 00:20:40,830
stop off somewhere at the,

727
00:20:40,831 --> 00:20:41,431
at the place,

728
00:20:41,431 --> 00:20:41,750
you know,

729
00:20:41,750 --> 00:20:43,890
in check because you'd have
to have gravity to use it.

730
00:20:43,891 --> 00:20:44,724
Right.

731
00:20:44,980 --> 00:20:45,631
Where's it at?

732
00:20:45,631 --> 00:20:46,000
You know,

733
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:49,510
sort of electricity seems like a bulky
piece to bring up with you if you're

734
00:20:49,750 --> 00:20:50,950
limited amount of space,

735
00:20:50,951 --> 00:20:51,251
you know,

736
00:20:51,251 --> 00:20:51,710
I don't know.

737
00:20:51,710 --> 00:20:54,730
It doesn't it all also seemed that you um,

738
00:20:54,850 --> 00:20:56,380
if you did use it up in space,

739
00:20:56,381 --> 00:20:57,214
if it wouldn't work.

740
00:20:57,220 --> 00:20:57,461
Yeah.

741
00:20:57,461 --> 00:20:58,630
Cause it shoots you right up.

742
00:20:58,631 --> 00:21:00,430
Maybe who knows who don't
have any resistance.

743
00:21:00,460 --> 00:21:00,601
Yeah.

744
00:21:00,601 --> 00:21:01,490
You have the gravity.

745
00:21:01,491 --> 00:21:02,380
It's like half the thing.

746
00:21:02,381 --> 00:21:02,830
Right.

747
00:21:02,830 --> 00:21:04,570
I think that's the principle
that it's working with

748
00:21:06,270 --> 00:21:07,600
parish then would work fine.

749
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:08,830
It took a chamber up there to space.

750
00:21:08,831 --> 00:21:10,570
You won't have to use as
much salt there or something.

751
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:11,620
I think it feels good.

752
00:21:11,710 --> 00:21:14,920
That's why I like it by the
vibrating on it and I don't know.

753
00:21:14,921 --> 00:21:16,090
I don't know if it's to do with anything.

754
00:21:16,810 --> 00:21:20,110
I think I feel it's like a little
body massage when I get on there.

755
00:21:20,111 --> 00:21:21,430
And for folks who don't know what it is,

756
00:21:21,670 --> 00:21:25,600
it's like some sort of a giant
speaker but it doesn't make sound,

757
00:21:25,630 --> 00:21:26,710
it just sends its a,

758
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:27,310
its such,

759
00:21:27,310 --> 00:21:29,920
so we're describe it
sends like sonic waves,

760
00:21:29,921 --> 00:21:30,580
right?

761
00:21:30,580 --> 00:21:30,851
Yeah.

762
00:21:30,851 --> 00:21:32,800
It moves you up down
and it's the voice coil,

763
00:21:33,130 --> 00:21:33,930
which like us,

764
00:21:33,930 --> 00:21:36,850
it's like a speaker as a voice
call and there's a cone on it.

765
00:21:37,150 --> 00:21:38,770
Then the voice called
moves the cone up and down.

766
00:21:38,771 --> 00:21:39,760
That creates a sound wave.

767
00:21:39,761 --> 00:21:39,941
This is,

768
00:21:39,941 --> 00:21:40,390
those happened,

769
00:21:40,390 --> 00:21:41,560
cone has platform.

770
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:44,170
So it moves you up and down
if variety of frequency.

771
00:21:44,171 --> 00:21:47,140
So it kind of runs you
through a pattern and yeah.

772
00:21:47,230 --> 00:21:48,550
Then you could dial it up and say,

773
00:21:48,551 --> 00:21:50,410
oh I wanted this is
supposed to do this or that.

774
00:21:50,411 --> 00:21:51,040
You know,

775
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:52,810
I thought it was gonna be
big a hit be a big hit.

776
00:21:52,811 --> 00:21:53,051
You know,

777
00:21:53,051 --> 00:21:53,740
cause it,

778
00:21:53,740 --> 00:21:55,900
I think it has something to
do with that fat ass syndrome.

779
00:21:55,901 --> 00:21:56,141
You know,

780
00:21:56,141 --> 00:21:58,240
are there people that get
that going on from too much?

781
00:21:58,241 --> 00:21:59,890
Is it stopping off at the wrong places?

782
00:21:59,891 --> 00:22:00,161
You know,

783
00:22:00,161 --> 00:22:01,840
and I don't know if the turtle sign,

784
00:22:01,841 --> 00:22:02,674
I can fix that.

785
00:22:02,840 --> 00:22:04,340
That's a good start to it.

786
00:22:04,380 --> 00:22:05,320
So I think they should,

787
00:22:05,350 --> 00:22:05,810
you know,

788
00:22:05,810 --> 00:22:06,180
eat,

789
00:22:06,180 --> 00:22:09,160
eat less of that shit and
work out a little bit.

790
00:22:09,161 --> 00:22:12,010
But what I do know about
it is whatever it does,

791
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:12,970
it feels good.

792
00:22:13,390 --> 00:22:13,751
You know,

793
00:22:13,751 --> 00:22:14,584
I don't,

794
00:22:14,650 --> 00:22:16,000
I don't know why it feels good.

795
00:22:16,120 --> 00:22:16,953
I'm not sure,

796
00:22:17,020 --> 00:22:18,040
but it feels like a little,

797
00:22:18,210 --> 00:22:19,210
and you're getting vibrated.

798
00:22:19,211 --> 00:22:20,410
It feels like a little massage.

799
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:20,650
Like,

800
00:22:20,650 --> 00:22:21,400
ah,

801
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:21,521
yeah,

802
00:22:21,521 --> 00:22:23,020
you can believe something's happening.

803
00:22:23,021 --> 00:22:23,231
You know,

804
00:22:23,231 --> 00:22:24,520
I don't know exactly what's going on,

805
00:22:24,521 --> 00:22:27,490
but it seems to be something that
was already the variations too.

806
00:22:27,491 --> 00:22:28,121
It's really cool.

807
00:22:28,121 --> 00:22:32,200
It's just a cycle where it'll go really
fast and really slow and then so it

808
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:33,820
keeps you kind of interested in it.

809
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:34,691
And it's supposed to,

810
00:22:34,691 --> 00:22:35,530
by doing that,

811
00:22:35,710 --> 00:22:40,450
it's supposed to be stimulating
individual Glam and get your flow going.

812
00:22:40,451 --> 00:22:40,811
You know,

813
00:22:40,811 --> 00:22:41,350
you're uh,

814
00:22:41,350 --> 00:22:42,580
like you were saying about that,

815
00:22:42,581 --> 00:22:46,000
working up like that and you've
got to get your body in motion.

816
00:22:46,001 --> 00:22:46,301
You know,

817
00:22:46,301 --> 00:22:47,111
I think people,

818
00:22:47,111 --> 00:22:50,170
they sit too long in a chair all
day long without moving around.

819
00:22:50,171 --> 00:22:51,340
I don't think it was
probably not that good.

820
00:22:51,370 --> 00:22:51,581
Yeah,

821
00:22:51,581 --> 00:22:53,050
we've talked about it a million times.

822
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:54,550
The whole thing is just

823
00:22:56,650 --> 00:22:59,650
sitting in an office as a fucking
terrible way to live your life.

824
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:01,210
It's supposed to be super bad for you.

825
00:23:01,211 --> 00:23:02,290
As I sit in an office,

826
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:03,101
well,

827
00:23:03,101 --> 00:23:03,371
you know,

828
00:23:03,371 --> 00:23:03,721
it's a wheel.

829
00:23:03,721 --> 00:23:05,380
They do it at like three hours at a pop.

830
00:23:05,560 --> 00:23:07,000
And even then I get up and I'm like,

831
00:23:08,530 --> 00:23:09,251
I have an office.

832
00:23:09,251 --> 00:23:10,360
I sit in my office every day,

833
00:23:10,361 --> 00:23:12,250
all day long and going to get
out of it and go back to it.

834
00:23:12,251 --> 00:23:12,770
You know,

835
00:23:12,770 --> 00:23:14,050
in our office is how you set it up.

836
00:23:14,051 --> 00:23:14,291
I think.

837
00:23:14,291 --> 00:23:15,700
See this is okay to sit around here.

838
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:16,920
This is a fine office.

839
00:23:16,921 --> 00:23:17,200
Sorry.

840
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:17,490
Nice.

841
00:23:17,490 --> 00:23:19,480
Is it that they get that they're horrible.

842
00:23:19,481 --> 00:23:20,111
Lied.

843
00:23:20,111 --> 00:23:20,801
And then there's this,

844
00:23:20,801 --> 00:23:21,400
there's the,

845
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:23,320
there's the rules and
you've got a suit on.

846
00:23:23,321 --> 00:23:23,980
You know,

847
00:23:23,980 --> 00:23:24,910
they're sitting in the office.

848
00:23:24,911 --> 00:23:26,440
The whole thing represents a bummer.

849
00:23:26,500 --> 00:23:28,690
Do you think you have to do that
to people to get them to work?

850
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:31,090
Do you have to make them wear
a suit to get them to work?

851
00:23:31,091 --> 00:23:31,581
I mean if you,

852
00:23:31,581 --> 00:23:34,270
if you let people wear t
shirts and jeans and shit,

853
00:23:34,271 --> 00:23:36,760
would they take insurance
as seriously as they do?

854
00:23:36,761 --> 00:23:37,241
If they're aware,

855
00:23:37,241 --> 00:23:38,590
that goofy monkey suit,

856
00:23:38,950 --> 00:23:39,400
you know,

857
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:42,550
would they stick to the company line
when they're on the phone giving those,

858
00:23:42,551 --> 00:23:42,970
uh,

859
00:23:42,970 --> 00:23:44,170
those pep speaks.

860
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:46,400
You wonder what image
they're trying to project.

861
00:23:46,430 --> 00:23:47,480
What is it you're trying to,

862
00:23:47,650 --> 00:23:48,483
you know,

863
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:50,140
sends Guy Mr. Crash.

864
00:23:50,141 --> 00:23:50,530
Yeah.

865
00:23:50,530 --> 00:23:50,730
Well,

866
00:23:50,730 --> 00:23:54,410
I look at my tie and I never
swear why when I'm at the office,

867
00:23:54,411 --> 00:23:55,270
I'm completely approved

868
00:23:55,420 --> 00:23:59,230
and I'm leaving these guys every time
because I just don't think that that's who

869
00:23:59,231 --> 00:24:03,370
I want to be doing anything with is
these characters that are not working on

870
00:24:03,371 --> 00:24:03,851
their own,

871
00:24:03,851 --> 00:24:04,180
uh,

872
00:24:04,180 --> 00:24:04,660
you know,

873
00:24:04,660 --> 00:24:08,650
uh Oh there for these
guys or those who are you?

874
00:24:08,651 --> 00:24:09,251
What do you want?

875
00:24:09,251 --> 00:24:10,084
What's your story?

876
00:24:10,120 --> 00:24:10,391
Well,

877
00:24:10,391 --> 00:24:11,560
these guys were those guys,

878
00:24:11,561 --> 00:24:12,160
you know what I mean?

879
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:13,660
You're working for somebody and you're,

880
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:15,610
that's why you're showing
up in a tie and a suit,

881
00:24:15,710 --> 00:24:19,640
or you have a bunch of people working
for you and you want to look the role.

882
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:20,331
Yeah,

883
00:24:20,331 --> 00:24:21,164
you got to look at,

884
00:24:23,340 --> 00:24:25,440
I'm here to sell insurance was to crash.

885
00:24:25,441 --> 00:24:27,060
I'm a no nonsense guy.

886
00:24:27,300 --> 00:24:28,350
Look at my cuff there.

887
00:24:28,351 --> 00:24:29,184
Perfect.

888
00:24:29,610 --> 00:24:31,770
There's guys that do those
commercials on the TV,

889
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:33,720
a rich person or whatever it is.

890
00:24:33,721 --> 00:24:34,890
They're all like at my boat.

891
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:35,191
All right,

892
00:24:35,191 --> 00:24:36,480
for these houses everywhere.

893
00:24:36,481 --> 00:24:37,530
And I got a yacht,

894
00:24:37,560 --> 00:24:38,430
looked at all mine,

895
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:39,361
all this stuff.

896
00:24:39,361 --> 00:24:40,194
I got,

897
00:24:40,510 --> 00:24:41,510
I am living well,

898
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:45,030
just go ahead and meanwhile I'm standing
here in this terrible auditorium with a

899
00:24:45,031 --> 00:24:48,750
bunch of you and this is what begging
for you maybe to give me some of your

900
00:24:48,751 --> 00:24:51,690
money so I can continue on with my maybe,

901
00:24:51,691 --> 00:24:53,490
maybe not lifestyle that you know.

902
00:24:54,100 --> 00:24:54,311
Yeah,

903
00:24:54,311 --> 00:24:58,480
there's a lot of those weird guys that
are like motivational speakers and they

904
00:24:58,481 --> 00:25:01,960
motivate you to come to their seminars
and they make a fuck load of money from

905
00:25:01,961 --> 00:25:02,794
your,

906
00:25:03,370 --> 00:25:04,091
from your mind.

907
00:25:04,091 --> 00:25:04,331
You're like,

908
00:25:04,331 --> 00:25:06,580
wait a minute that you had a boat fishing.

909
00:25:06,581 --> 00:25:07,351
What's going on?

910
00:25:07,351 --> 00:25:09,610
And it seems like you were still
hanging out here at this place.

911
00:25:09,611 --> 00:25:10,630
This is a bummer in here.

912
00:25:10,840 --> 00:25:12,070
I can hardly wait to leave.

913
00:25:12,280 --> 00:25:13,300
This is your day,

914
00:25:13,330 --> 00:25:14,200
you know you're getting,

915
00:25:15,460 --> 00:25:16,293
yeah.

916
00:25:16,330 --> 00:25:19,150
It's not the best way to live life for me.

917
00:25:19,330 --> 00:25:19,661
No,

918
00:25:19,661 --> 00:25:20,980
I'm glad someone's doing it.

919
00:25:21,320 --> 00:25:22,380
Always doing it.

920
00:25:22,381 --> 00:25:24,370
We would not have apple computers.

921
00:25:24,610 --> 00:25:26,710
You would not have Samsung phones.

922
00:25:26,711 --> 00:25:28,660
You would not have Audi cars.

923
00:25:28,661 --> 00:25:30,010
He wouldn't have these things.

924
00:25:30,340 --> 00:25:33,040
If somebody wasn't out there busting
their ass every day in an office,

925
00:25:33,041 --> 00:25:33,850
people like it.

926
00:25:33,850 --> 00:25:36,670
Some people are suited for that type of a,

927
00:25:36,671 --> 00:25:37,061
of a,

928
00:25:37,061 --> 00:25:37,711
of a lifestyle.

929
00:25:37,711 --> 00:25:40,870
So maybe if we reach too many people
with this message of get your shit

930
00:25:40,871 --> 00:25:41,261
together,

931
00:25:41,261 --> 00:25:43,360
it'd be terrible for
civilization as a whole.

932
00:25:43,390 --> 00:25:43,830
Overall,

933
00:25:43,830 --> 00:25:47,620
this one would weaken us and like the
Chinese would take over all this could be

934
00:25:47,621 --> 00:25:48,080
low.

935
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:48,913
It's going to be a

936
00:25:50,230 --> 00:25:51,100
factor for that.

937
00:25:51,101 --> 00:25:51,311
I mean,

938
00:25:51,311 --> 00:25:52,061
we're fucking it up.

939
00:25:52,061 --> 00:25:54,790
We're fucking it up with these goddamn
isolation tanks and these medical

940
00:25:54,791 --> 00:25:55,950
marijuana dispensaries,

941
00:25:56,020 --> 00:25:56,171
oh,

942
00:25:56,171 --> 00:25:59,100
those are wonderful to reach the next day.

943
00:26:01,290 --> 00:26:02,920
I don't want to live are unnatural life.

944
00:26:03,100 --> 00:26:05,530
How are you going to continue to build
these buildings and launch these missiles

945
00:26:05,740 --> 00:26:08,440
if we don't continue to
live on unnatural life?

946
00:26:08,620 --> 00:26:10,660
The more we tune in to the natural life,

947
00:26:10,870 --> 00:26:13,900
the more we see how ridiculous
it is when we wake up.

948
00:26:14,620 --> 00:26:15,640
It's coming our way.

949
00:26:15,641 --> 00:26:18,130
I think that people are
coming around right now.

950
00:26:18,560 --> 00:26:19,281
It's happening.

951
00:26:19,281 --> 00:26:20,120
I think it is.

952
00:26:20,220 --> 00:26:21,053
I think you're right.

953
00:26:22,130 --> 00:26:24,110
If you look at it like
America is important,

954
00:26:24,140 --> 00:26:24,381
you know,

955
00:26:24,381 --> 00:26:25,090
even though I,

956
00:26:25,090 --> 00:26:26,810
I don't have a flag or nothing like that,

957
00:26:26,811 --> 00:26:27,070
but,

958
00:26:27,070 --> 00:26:27,770
but it,

959
00:26:27,770 --> 00:26:30,800
it's where we live and it's kind of like
where we're from and it's sort of like

960
00:26:30,801 --> 00:26:31,700
what we're supposed to be,

961
00:26:32,030 --> 00:26:32,511
uh,

962
00:26:32,511 --> 00:26:32,781
you know,

963
00:26:32,781 --> 00:26:34,340
proud about and you're supposed to say,

964
00:26:34,370 --> 00:26:35,203
oh,

965
00:26:35,270 --> 00:26:36,103
I'm from here.

966
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:40,910
And I'm really glad about that because
where it is and the way they operate,

967
00:26:40,990 --> 00:26:42,100
I'm Po,

968
00:26:42,190 --> 00:26:43,620
I go along with that.

969
00:26:43,980 --> 00:26:46,620
But it's gotten too far now in my opinion,

970
00:26:46,621 --> 00:26:46,951
which is,

971
00:26:46,951 --> 00:26:47,191
you know,

972
00:26:47,191 --> 00:26:48,024
everybody's gone.

973
00:26:48,990 --> 00:26:51,750
It needs to get to where the people
actually get an overview again,

974
00:26:51,751 --> 00:26:55,710
where they start to evaluate situations
and then make correct decisions based on

975
00:26:55,711 --> 00:26:59,010
now instead of like these prehistoric,

976
00:26:59,030 --> 00:26:59,480
uh,

977
00:26:59,480 --> 00:27:02,970
versions of what's got
us to here need to be,

978
00:27:02,971 --> 00:27:03,330
uh,

979
00:27:03,330 --> 00:27:03,541
you know,

980
00:27:03,541 --> 00:27:08,290
hopefully at some point let go with
and get a new evaluation that's,

981
00:27:08,300 --> 00:27:08,680
that's,

982
00:27:08,680 --> 00:27:08,850
uh,

983
00:27:08,850 --> 00:27:10,950
pertains to where we're
at now in the world.

984
00:27:11,130 --> 00:27:13,410
What can we do now to
get along with people?

985
00:27:13,500 --> 00:27:15,390
How can we work together this,

986
00:27:15,420 --> 00:27:17,070
even if these military see what the,

987
00:27:17,490 --> 00:27:20,220
I think that we sell a lot
of guns in this country and,

988
00:27:20,221 --> 00:27:20,540
uh,

989
00:27:20,540 --> 00:27:21,440
in pharmaceuticals.

990
00:27:21,450 --> 00:27:22,100
So he said,

991
00:27:22,100 --> 00:27:22,201
oh,

992
00:27:22,201 --> 00:27:24,600
I don't think we're going to get out
of the bomb business because it's our

993
00:27:24,601 --> 00:27:25,081
business,

994
00:27:25,081 --> 00:27:25,261
you know,

995
00:27:25,261 --> 00:27:27,510
so we have to figure out how
to get these guys working,

996
00:27:27,690 --> 00:27:28,770
doing something good,

997
00:27:28,771 --> 00:27:28,951
you know,

998
00:27:28,951 --> 00:27:29,581
so we don't like say,

999
00:27:29,581 --> 00:27:29,791
Oh,

1000
00:27:29,791 --> 00:27:31,020
all your jobs are gone now.

1001
00:27:31,320 --> 00:27:34,410
Figure out how we could go
in and do stuff together.

1002
00:27:34,630 --> 00:27:39,360
Use our money and our resources to
create situations that are beneficial for

1003
00:27:39,361 --> 00:27:39,721
people.

1004
00:27:39,721 --> 00:27:40,554
They're not gonna,

1005
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:43,350
we're not gonna make friends
by shooting at people.

1006
00:27:43,351 --> 00:27:43,991
We all know that.

1007
00:27:43,991 --> 00:27:44,311
And I mean,

1008
00:27:44,311 --> 00:27:45,030
this is,

1009
00:27:45,030 --> 00:27:45,420
you know,

1010
00:27:45,420 --> 00:27:47,310
this is some kind of a fictitious,

1011
00:27:47,320 --> 00:27:48,060
uh,

1012
00:27:48,060 --> 00:27:50,840
a concept that we can go over
and make people happy by,

1013
00:27:50,870 --> 00:27:51,511
by killing them.

1014
00:27:51,511 --> 00:27:52,340
You know what I mean?

1015
00:27:52,340 --> 00:27:52,461
Well,

1016
00:27:52,461 --> 00:27:56,960
the concept of war being for financial
benefit is still pretty alien to a lot of

1017
00:27:56,961 --> 00:27:57,261
folks.

1018
00:27:57,261 --> 00:27:58,094
They don't believe it.

1019
00:27:58,690 --> 00:28:01,000
They don't believe that
that's why wars are started.

1020
00:28:02,120 --> 00:28:02,690
Yeah.

1021
00:28:02,690 --> 00:28:03,140
Well,

1022
00:28:03,140 --> 00:28:07,730
what all you'd have to consider is how
much benefit there could have been done

1023
00:28:07,970 --> 00:28:08,870
to America.

1024
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:09,111
I mean,

1025
00:28:09,111 --> 00:28:13,340
if you're really a pro America
person and you really are a patriot,

1026
00:28:13,460 --> 00:28:14,293
think about what a,

1027
00:28:14,330 --> 00:28:19,330
what a benefit it would have been to
America to take a lot of that money that

1028
00:28:19,371 --> 00:28:22,700
went to this crazy war that
no one believes in anymore.

1029
00:28:23,060 --> 00:28:24,830
And try to clean up inner cities,

1030
00:28:25,010 --> 00:28:26,120
try to fix Chicago,

1031
00:28:26,150 --> 00:28:26,983
try to fix,

1032
00:28:27,320 --> 00:28:28,820
fix the border towns,

1033
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:30,140
try to help Mexico.

1034
00:28:30,170 --> 00:28:31,190
How dangerous.

1035
00:28:31,640 --> 00:28:34,850
We have a dangerous situation
like a hundred miles from us.

1036
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:35,300
I mean,

1037
00:28:35,300 --> 00:28:36,110
what,

1038
00:28:36,110 --> 00:28:37,040
what the fuck is that?

1039
00:28:37,280 --> 00:28:38,051
You go to what it would it?

1040
00:28:38,051 --> 00:28:38,600
How long?

1041
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:39,830
How far is it to San Diego?

1042
00:28:40,340 --> 00:28:41,173
It's two hours.

1043
00:28:41,260 --> 00:28:42,980
So what does that 120 miles,

1044
00:28:43,130 --> 00:28:46,140
something like that to 40 I
think it's and are nearby.

1045
00:28:46,220 --> 00:28:47,053
How fast you going,

1046
00:28:47,070 --> 00:28:47,903
bitch?

1047
00:28:48,020 --> 00:28:53,020
You're not going 130 miles an hour and
you fucking retard when 41 4,140 miles.

1048
00:28:54,050 --> 00:28:54,351
Okay,

1049
00:28:54,351 --> 00:28:56,300
so 70 miles an hour for two hours.

1050
00:28:56,690 --> 00:28:57,530
That's Mexico.

1051
00:28:57,560 --> 00:28:58,490
That's crazy.

1052
00:28:58,550 --> 00:29:01,640
It's a two hour drive to third
world country that's in turmoil.

1053
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:05,540
And we don't do a God damn thing about
it and we're sending people to someplace

1054
00:29:05,541 --> 00:29:09,620
that's so far removed from us that just
coincidentally happens to have oil.

1055
00:29:09,650 --> 00:29:10,550
That's not why we're here.

1056
00:29:11,060 --> 00:29:12,020
That is not why we're here,

1057
00:29:12,021 --> 00:29:12,854
Mr. Crash,

1058
00:29:12,950 --> 00:29:14,910
we're here to fix things like oil.

1059
00:29:14,911 --> 00:29:15,800
Fig is a funny one.

1060
00:29:15,801 --> 00:29:16,970
I got a mess over here.

1061
00:29:17,330 --> 00:29:21,950
We have all these people that killed
people in New York City from Saudi Arabia,

1062
00:29:22,340 --> 00:29:24,440
but we need to get over
here and over here.

1063
00:29:25,380 --> 00:29:25,711
Do you know what?

1064
00:29:25,711 --> 00:29:28,680
I don't believe that oil is fossil fuel.

1065
00:29:28,770 --> 00:29:29,121
They say,

1066
00:29:29,121 --> 00:29:29,640
oh,

1067
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:30,570
it's from a fossil.

1068
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:30,931
You Think,

1069
00:29:30,931 --> 00:29:31,051
oh,

1070
00:29:31,051 --> 00:29:31,801
I got fossils.

1071
00:29:31,801 --> 00:29:32,634
They're rocks.

1072
00:29:32,850 --> 00:29:33,301
You know what I mean?

1073
00:29:33,301 --> 00:29:34,870
It's pressure under the ground said,

1074
00:29:34,910 --> 00:29:35,010
oh,

1075
00:29:35,010 --> 00:29:35,521
so in other words,

1076
00:29:35,521 --> 00:29:37,530
he used to be the same dinosaurs
out in the middle of the ocean.

1077
00:29:37,710 --> 00:29:37,801
Well,

1078
00:29:37,801 --> 00:29:38,041
I don't think,

1079
00:29:38,041 --> 00:29:39,300
do you think his last class anymore?

1080
00:29:39,301 --> 00:29:40,920
I think they think it's rotten plankton.

1081
00:29:40,990 --> 00:29:41,440
Yeah.

1082
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:42,040
If at the top

1083
00:29:42,040 --> 00:29:46,120
of the frozen Alps and the bottom of the
ocean and over here in the desert and

1084
00:29:46,390 --> 00:29:47,021
everywhere,

1085
00:29:47,021 --> 00:29:48,600
at one time there was
plankton all over it,

1086
00:29:48,610 --> 00:29:52,210
an hour or whatever to make these
gigantic puddles of this stuff that we're

1087
00:29:52,211 --> 00:29:53,440
pumping out for some reason.

1088
00:29:53,860 --> 00:29:54,640
And then you say,

1089
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:55,030
oh look,

1090
00:29:55,030 --> 00:29:55,863
step back and say,

1091
00:29:56,020 --> 00:29:57,300
but from an alien,

1092
00:29:57,550 --> 00:29:58,780
what are those guys doing down there?

1093
00:29:58,810 --> 00:29:59,051
Well,

1094
00:29:59,051 --> 00:29:59,321
you know,

1095
00:29:59,321 --> 00:29:59,571
they're,

1096
00:29:59,571 --> 00:29:59,781
they're,

1097
00:29:59,781 --> 00:30:01,120
they're pumping this stuff out of there,

1098
00:30:01,121 --> 00:30:02,160
the oil they call it,

1099
00:30:02,161 --> 00:30:03,700
and then they turn it into a,

1100
00:30:03,701 --> 00:30:05,230
a plastic material that,

1101
00:30:05,380 --> 00:30:06,400
that litters the planet.

1102
00:30:06,401 --> 00:30:09,460
They can't get rid of it or they take
it and then they burned it into the

1103
00:30:09,461 --> 00:30:11,560
atmosphere and poisoned themselves.

1104
00:30:11,940 --> 00:30:12,280
And then,

1105
00:30:12,280 --> 00:30:13,270
and then what they do,

1106
00:30:13,271 --> 00:30:17,230
they spend all their money to fight
amongst each other to see who gets control

1107
00:30:17,231 --> 00:30:17,590
of it.

1108
00:30:17,590 --> 00:30:20,230
And you're thinking this whole
stuff isn't really that necessary.

1109
00:30:20,230 --> 00:30:22,330
It could be done without
back to the hemp again,

1110
00:30:22,360 --> 00:30:23,041
look at that hemp,

1111
00:30:23,041 --> 00:30:25,020
but what it has to
offer computer speaking.

1112
00:30:25,390 --> 00:30:25,721
Well,

1113
00:30:25,721 --> 00:30:26,400
it's just too hard,

1114
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:27,610
too difficult to control.

1115
00:30:27,611 --> 00:30:27,791
You know,

1116
00:30:27,791 --> 00:30:29,710
there was a book on the process of,

1117
00:30:29,980 --> 00:30:30,580
of,

1118
00:30:30,580 --> 00:30:35,320
of oil being developed that they were
trying to speculate somehow or another

1119
00:30:35,321 --> 00:30:35,831
that it was,

1120
00:30:35,831 --> 00:30:36,664
um,

1121
00:30:36,700 --> 00:30:39,220
that it was developed through a
natural process and the earth.

1122
00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:42,880
And they were saying that our
ideas of it were incorrect,

1123
00:30:42,910 --> 00:30:44,560
but I don't think it was well received.

1124
00:30:44,710 --> 00:30:45,670
I have the books,

1125
00:30:45,850 --> 00:30:46,570
I never read it.

1126
00:30:46,570 --> 00:30:47,470
I bought it and I was like,

1127
00:30:47,500 --> 00:30:50,440
I'm going to read that one day and it
just sat there and never fucking read it.

1128
00:30:50,650 --> 00:30:51,820
I just couldn't get behind it.

1129
00:30:51,821 --> 00:30:52,654
It's just seemed,

1130
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:56,950
it seemed kind of goofy that anybody
wouldn't have figured that out by now.

1131
00:30:57,730 --> 00:30:58,870
Exactly where you're going.

1132
00:30:59,170 --> 00:31:00,003
Wow.

1133
00:31:00,160 --> 00:31:03,580
That thing about the planets to how
they're supposed to be circumcised and the

1134
00:31:03,581 --> 00:31:03,880
earth.

1135
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:04,713
What the sun,

1136
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:05,830
let's say the sun's moving,

1137
00:31:05,831 --> 00:31:06,390
right?

1138
00:31:06,390 --> 00:31:07,240
This is going this way.

1139
00:31:07,570 --> 00:31:10,060
So now they have a believer though
that planets are circling the sun.

1140
00:31:10,061 --> 00:31:10,480
Is it?

1141
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:12,520
I think that this makes more sense to me.

1142
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:13,601
And there's other,

1143
00:31:13,601 --> 00:31:13,871
you know,

1144
00:31:13,871 --> 00:31:14,770
this isn't my thought,

1145
00:31:14,771 --> 00:31:15,604
but somebody showed,

1146
00:31:16,090 --> 00:31:16,421
oh yeah,

1147
00:31:16,421 --> 00:31:18,610
that makes me say this
sun is going this way.

1148
00:31:18,780 --> 00:31:19,081
Well,

1149
00:31:19,081 --> 00:31:22,810
what makes us think we're not in rotation
in a vortex being pulled by the sun

1150
00:31:22,811 --> 00:31:23,644
going somewhere.

1151
00:31:23,780 --> 00:31:24,601
I think we're,

1152
00:31:24,601 --> 00:31:25,421
we're on a trip,

1153
00:31:25,421 --> 00:31:25,691
man.

1154
00:31:25,691 --> 00:31:26,051
We're going.

1155
00:31:26,051 --> 00:31:27,370
So we started off where,

1156
00:31:27,550 --> 00:31:30,220
where was the sun a hundred
years ago and where's it at now?

1157
00:31:30,460 --> 00:31:31,620
And then where are we
going to be later on?

1158
00:31:31,621 --> 00:31:34,670
I believe the sun is pulling
us through space and were in,

1159
00:31:35,020 --> 00:31:36,340
well that's not a belief.

1160
00:31:36,341 --> 00:31:37,170
That's a fact.

1161
00:31:37,170 --> 00:31:39,070
That's that's absolutely what's happening.

1162
00:31:39,100 --> 00:31:40,660
The whole galaxies moving.

1163
00:31:40,900 --> 00:31:41,141
Yeah.

1164
00:31:41,141 --> 00:31:41,351
No,

1165
00:31:41,351 --> 00:31:42,370
this is something that,

1166
00:31:42,820 --> 00:31:43,330
uh,

1167
00:31:43,330 --> 00:31:45,680
astrophysicists have
figured out a while ago.

1168
00:31:45,680 --> 00:31:49,480
So at the whole universe is kind of
moving that just have expansion thing.

1169
00:31:49,670 --> 00:31:50,170
I don't know.

1170
00:31:50,170 --> 00:31:52,180
I think we're going galaxies moving.

1171
00:31:52,210 --> 00:31:54,400
I think we're going in
a direction somewhere.

1172
00:31:54,430 --> 00:31:58,330
I think that if we figured out where's
The sun and where is it off too.

1173
00:31:58,540 --> 00:32:00,070
I think we're behind it.

1174
00:32:00,100 --> 00:32:03,220
I think that we're following it
and this is the way the rotation,

1175
00:32:03,280 --> 00:32:05,140
I don't know which way
is up or down in here.

1176
00:32:05,380 --> 00:32:06,580
Where's the north south?

1177
00:32:06,581 --> 00:32:09,190
That is exactly how it's
supposed to be described.

1178
00:32:09,191 --> 00:32:10,780
I think as it goes,

1179
00:32:10,781 --> 00:32:10,991
you know,

1180
00:32:10,991 --> 00:32:12,190
we're circling around it.

1181
00:32:12,490 --> 00:32:13,810
I think we're going to run it this way.

1182
00:32:13,900 --> 00:32:14,733
I don't know.

1183
00:32:15,080 --> 00:32:16,130
I'm too fucking stupid.

1184
00:32:16,250 --> 00:32:16,871
I don't know.

1185
00:32:16,871 --> 00:32:18,220
I don't understand it at all.

1186
00:32:18,221 --> 00:32:22,210
I mean when I watched those
scientific documentaries on space,

1187
00:32:22,211 --> 00:32:26,170
it's one of the most fascinating things
ever and most fascinating so that it's

1188
00:32:26,171 --> 00:32:28,480
so rarely brought up in
regular conversation.

1189
00:32:28,710 --> 00:32:32,200
That's where some of this money
should go into like expansion of the,

1190
00:32:32,201 --> 00:32:33,910
of the reality situation.

1191
00:32:33,911 --> 00:32:34,331
We're in here.

1192
00:32:34,331 --> 00:32:34,570
They said,

1193
00:32:34,570 --> 00:32:35,060
oh look,

1194
00:32:35,060 --> 00:32:36,610
we have this and that
we can think about now,

1195
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:39,320
get these scientists challenge
to put the phone down.

1196
00:32:39,321 --> 00:32:39,890
First off,

1197
00:32:39,890 --> 00:32:40,100
put

1198
00:32:40,100 --> 00:32:44,190
this on down enough on the phone
is Jaeger counter designer.

1199
00:32:44,210 --> 00:32:47,000
It tells you the name of the tune it's on.

1200
00:32:47,001 --> 00:32:47,834
You know,

1201
00:32:48,170 --> 00:32:48,921
it's like,

1202
00:32:48,921 --> 00:32:49,311
okay,

1203
00:32:49,311 --> 00:32:52,070
it's a fun and nobody answers it,

1204
00:32:52,130 --> 00:32:54,110
which is what really freaks me out,

1205
00:32:54,111 --> 00:32:54,321
man.

1206
00:32:54,321 --> 00:32:55,190
I got it.

1207
00:32:55,191 --> 00:32:56,270
Cause I've got to call everybody at night.

1208
00:32:56,310 --> 00:32:56,401
Say,

1209
00:32:56,401 --> 00:32:56,571
Hey,

1210
00:32:56,571 --> 00:32:58,070
don't forget to come down tomorrow.

1211
00:32:58,100 --> 00:32:59,450
I know I made an appointment,

1212
00:32:59,451 --> 00:33:02,420
but I'm convinced that you're not
going to be able to remember it.

1213
00:33:02,421 --> 00:33:03,770
So I'm calling you now to say,

1214
00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:04,490
Oh hey,

1215
00:33:04,490 --> 00:33:07,820
don't forget I get 20% people
answered the phone said,

1216
00:33:07,850 --> 00:33:08,301
Oh yeah,

1217
00:33:08,301 --> 00:33:08,751
no problem.

1218
00:33:08,751 --> 00:33:09,500
Got It.

1219
00:33:09,500 --> 00:33:13,220
The other 80% is a me leaving a message,

1220
00:33:13,250 --> 00:33:13,641
you know,

1221
00:33:13,641 --> 00:33:15,830
which I can't stand leaving a message,

1222
00:33:15,831 --> 00:33:18,050
but I'm thinking they
got it in their hand.

1223
00:33:18,790 --> 00:33:19,820
They had it right here.

1224
00:33:19,850 --> 00:33:20,360
They got,

1225
00:33:20,360 --> 00:33:21,980
how aren't they answering the phone?

1226
00:33:22,070 --> 00:33:22,820
It's a phone.

1227
00:33:22,820 --> 00:33:23,653
Hello?

1228
00:33:23,690 --> 00:33:24,021
Yeah,

1229
00:33:24,021 --> 00:33:27,680
but don't you think it's good that
there's all these capabilities of these

1230
00:33:27,681 --> 00:33:29,060
things have smart phones?

1231
00:33:29,060 --> 00:33:30,080
I think it's good to ever people,

1232
00:33:30,140 --> 00:33:32,180
other people have them bitcoin on it.

1233
00:33:32,181 --> 00:33:33,014
You can,

1234
00:33:33,250 --> 00:33:36,260
you can check out an email
link that somebody sends you.

1235
00:33:36,261 --> 00:33:37,190
You don't think that's good.

1236
00:33:37,370 --> 00:33:38,360
I think it's good for,

1237
00:33:38,361 --> 00:33:39,194
you know,

1238
00:33:39,430 --> 00:33:41,210
you know people that want to do that.

1239
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:41,601
Oh,

1240
00:33:41,601 --> 00:33:42,440
I think it's good.

1241
00:33:42,560 --> 00:33:43,161
I think it's good.

1242
00:33:43,161 --> 00:33:44,900
I just think the problem is overused.

1243
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:46,580
The problem is over
use of anything though.

1244
00:33:46,790 --> 00:33:48,430
It's overuse of softball.

1245
00:33:48,440 --> 00:33:51,890
If you just became a fucking softball
junkie and you're out there on the field

1246
00:33:51,891 --> 00:33:52,700
every day,

1247
00:33:52,700 --> 00:33:53,780
throwing that ball in the air,

1248
00:33:53,781 --> 00:33:55,790
hitting them by herself
into a tree and people like,

1249
00:33:55,791 --> 00:33:56,624
what is Tom Doing?

1250
00:33:56,700 --> 00:33:58,390
Can't wait for that
fucking game on Sunday.

1251
00:33:58,910 --> 00:33:59,571
Jesus Christ.

1252
00:33:59,571 --> 00:33:59,771
Tom,

1253
00:33:59,771 --> 00:34:01,150
you got a family and
he had a wife at home.

1254
00:34:01,210 --> 00:34:02,020
Get home.

1255
00:34:02,020 --> 00:34:02,240
You know,

1256
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:03,080
you're obsessing,

1257
00:34:03,170 --> 00:34:04,250
you're freaking people out,

1258
00:34:04,251 --> 00:34:04,850
man.

1259
00:34:04,850 --> 00:34:05,930
I think that's bad too.

1260
00:34:06,290 --> 00:34:09,560
But I think the phone in
moderation is a a beautiful thing.

1261
00:34:09,560 --> 00:34:11,720
And basing how much scientifical uh,

1262
00:34:11,930 --> 00:34:14,480
advancements they've done
on the phone in the past,

1263
00:34:14,481 --> 00:34:15,314
how many years,

1264
00:34:15,470 --> 00:34:18,140
if they quit that kind of
brain power into anything.

1265
00:34:18,200 --> 00:34:19,850
We're driving the same car almost.

1266
00:34:20,170 --> 00:34:21,110
I could assemble this.

1267
00:34:21,111 --> 00:34:22,400
Got a pretty new thing,

1268
00:34:22,401 --> 00:34:23,720
some kind of motorized or,

1269
00:34:23,721 --> 00:34:25,970
but it's pretty similar
to the cars that we had.

1270
00:34:26,030 --> 00:34:31,030
I was just talking with a friend last
night about how like the cars of 10 years

1271
00:34:31,461 --> 00:34:32,990
ago when I was a kid,

1272
00:34:33,140 --> 00:34:34,070
when I was in high school,

1273
00:34:34,250 --> 00:34:35,120
I was in high school.

1274
00:34:35,150 --> 00:34:37,940
I was 14 in 1984.

1275
00:34:38,240 --> 00:34:41,150
That's when I was at nine or
1981 when I was in high school.

1276
00:34:41,330 --> 00:34:42,470
And um,

1277
00:34:43,010 --> 00:34:44,160
there was a uh,

1278
00:34:44,250 --> 00:34:44,360
uh,

1279
00:34:44,360 --> 00:34:48,680
1970 Chevelle that this kid
had that was in my school.

1280
00:34:48,890 --> 00:34:49,723
And uh,

1281
00:34:49,730 --> 00:34:51,770
I guess he was like maybe
two years older than me,

1282
00:34:51,771 --> 00:34:55,220
so he might've been like 16 but you have
this 1970 Chevelle and everybody was

1283
00:34:55,221 --> 00:34:55,371
like,

1284
00:34:55,371 --> 00:34:56,780
Holy Shit,

1285
00:34:56,781 --> 00:34:57,080
look at that.

1286
00:34:57,080 --> 00:34:58,100
It was a classic.

1287
00:34:58,340 --> 00:34:59,480
So 70 Chevelle,

1288
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:00,353
SS,

1289
00:35:01,510 --> 00:35:03,110
three 50 years old.

1290
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:05,030
It's only 11 years old.

1291
00:35:05,240 --> 00:35:06,170
Like how was the car?

1292
00:35:06,171 --> 00:35:07,100
11 years old.

1293
00:35:07,101 --> 00:35:08,570
Like a classic back then,

1294
00:35:08,870 --> 00:35:10,730
but an 11 year old car today,

1295
00:35:11,480 --> 00:35:12,140
it's like,

1296
00:35:12,140 --> 00:35:12,830
you know,

1297
00:35:12,830 --> 00:35:14,090
it's not that big of a deal.

1298
00:35:14,091 --> 00:35:14,301
You know,

1299
00:35:14,301 --> 00:35:15,380
if you got a hold of a,

1300
00:35:15,570 --> 00:35:17,540
would that be a 2003,

1301
00:35:17,990 --> 00:35:19,250
2003 car?

1302
00:35:19,550 --> 00:35:20,480
And that's like,

1303
00:35:20,510 --> 00:35:21,620
it's a modern car.

1304
00:35:22,010 --> 00:35:22,791
Like what happened?

1305
00:35:22,791 --> 00:35:23,210
How'd that,

1306
00:35:23,210 --> 00:35:24,770
how'd that have dropped the ball?

1307
00:35:24,920 --> 00:35:25,880
Something happened.

1308
00:35:26,910 --> 00:35:29,090
They might've hit like
some sort of technological,

1309
00:35:29,210 --> 00:35:31,520
they're constantly pushing the
boundaries as far as like this,

1310
00:35:31,521 --> 00:35:35,450
this speed that cars can go and the g
forces that they can handle and like to

1311
00:35:35,451 --> 00:35:38,100
get like the track times get
a little bit better every year

1312
00:35:38,100 --> 00:35:38,940
with their sports cars.

1313
00:35:39,120 --> 00:35:41,190
But for the average regular car,

1314
00:35:41,191 --> 00:35:42,720
like at a certain point in time,

1315
00:35:42,780 --> 00:35:43,920
what else can you improve?

1316
00:35:43,921 --> 00:35:46,230
You going to add some electronic
blocks that were up there.

1317
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:47,940
Those people that got that a road,

1318
00:35:47,970 --> 00:35:50,010
they made those tiles that light up.

1319
00:35:50,130 --> 00:35:50,551
Oh yeah,

1320
00:35:50,551 --> 00:35:50,731
yeah.

1321
00:35:50,731 --> 00:35:52,350
The solar or road panels.

1322
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:53,540
Incredible.

1323
00:35:53,540 --> 00:35:54,380
Incredible,

1324
00:35:54,381 --> 00:35:54,960
incredible.

1325
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:59,310
Lights the city up like tron and stuff
and they're collecting energy in the car

1326
00:35:59,700 --> 00:36:00,121
and they could,

1327
00:36:00,121 --> 00:36:03,480
that could totally be implemented to
apparently that's completely realistic.

1328
00:36:04,740 --> 00:36:05,573
It's crazy.

1329
00:36:05,970 --> 00:36:06,900
Were there already,

1330
00:36:06,901 --> 00:36:07,830
we just have to get,

1331
00:36:07,860 --> 00:36:08,220
get,

1332
00:36:08,220 --> 00:36:09,180
get somebody to say,

1333
00:36:09,181 --> 00:36:09,541
you know,

1334
00:36:09,541 --> 00:36:10,170
a hike.

1335
00:36:10,170 --> 00:36:12,810
Do you know how weird do you
know weird city streets look?

1336
00:36:13,260 --> 00:36:17,610
Can you imagine if you lived in the
time before electricity and then someone

1337
00:36:17,611 --> 00:36:22,260
brought you to New York City Times
Square Saturday night and you're walking

1338
00:36:22,261 --> 00:36:26,430
through and you see all these lights
and all this craziness and the cars with

1339
00:36:26,431 --> 00:36:27,270
the lights and you're like,

1340
00:36:27,450 --> 00:36:28,560
Holy Shit,

1341
00:36:28,561 --> 00:36:29,970
I can't believe this.

1342
00:36:30,690 --> 00:36:35,550
That would be like a really
intense sort of a change.

1343
00:36:36,030 --> 00:36:39,900
But I wonder if it would be as
intense as all the roads being lit,

1344
00:36:40,830 --> 00:36:44,130
all the roads being lent to us right now.

1345
00:36:44,131 --> 00:36:46,140
That might be like we
might not be able to,

1346
00:36:46,141 --> 00:36:48,720
we might have to address the
fact that we live in the future.

1347
00:36:49,320 --> 00:36:50,580
Like if all of our fucking row,

1348
00:36:50,610 --> 00:36:52,920
I mean we might have all
collectively just go,

1349
00:36:52,921 --> 00:36:54,840
what the fuck are we doing?

1350
00:36:54,870 --> 00:36:55,561
Look what we're doing.

1351
00:36:55,561 --> 00:36:58,110
We have solar powered roads.

1352
00:36:58,560 --> 00:36:59,730
That's progress.

1353
00:36:59,731 --> 00:36:59,910
Yeah.

1354
00:36:59,910 --> 00:37:00,700
Oh yeah.

1355
00:37:00,700 --> 00:37:03,540
And not breaking down or they
have alternative purposes.

1356
00:37:03,541 --> 00:37:04,530
They're not only to drive on,

1357
00:37:04,531 --> 00:37:05,820
but they have other information.

1358
00:37:05,821 --> 00:37:07,740
They change would be so strange though.

1359
00:37:07,741 --> 00:37:09,600
The way it would alter our our world,

1360
00:37:09,601 --> 00:37:14,400
like our vision of the world would look
totally different if Hong Kong was lit

1361
00:37:14,401 --> 00:37:15,540
up with those kinds of,

1362
00:37:15,710 --> 00:37:19,200
I wonder what the effect would be w
I feel like it would make people more

1363
00:37:19,201 --> 00:37:20,034
festive.

1364
00:37:20,550 --> 00:37:20,960
It,

1365
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:21,361
you know,

1366
00:37:21,361 --> 00:37:22,350
I feel where,

1367
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:24,300
I mean you're driving
on this road already.

1368
00:37:24,301 --> 00:37:27,000
If these cars are just trying to
tune yourself out because of the,

1369
00:37:27,001 --> 00:37:32,001
it's such a tedious process to get from
point a to point B in a car is gray and

1370
00:37:32,611 --> 00:37:35,670
there's other people jammed up in there
and the speed's not what you like or

1371
00:37:35,671 --> 00:37:36,031
whatever,

1372
00:37:36,031 --> 00:37:36,271
you know.

1373
00:37:36,271 --> 00:37:37,104
So it's kind of a,

1374
00:37:37,260 --> 00:37:38,340
the transportation,

1375
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:41,010
I think they got some room
to improve on that for us.

1376
00:37:41,011 --> 00:37:41,221
You know,

1377
00:37:41,221 --> 00:37:42,030
if they,

1378
00:37:42,030 --> 00:37:43,050
if they put the phone down,

1379
00:37:43,740 --> 00:37:44,161
yeah.

1380
00:37:44,161 --> 00:37:45,110
If they put the phone down,

1381
00:37:45,120 --> 00:37:47,940
I get to concentrate and it's
helping them communicate though.

1382
00:37:47,970 --> 00:37:49,880
Maybe they can use the
phone to make the cars.

1383
00:37:49,910 --> 00:37:50,060
Yeah.

1384
00:37:50,060 --> 00:37:51,050
This is the roadways.

1385
00:37:51,060 --> 00:37:52,440
These are sole roadways.

1386
00:37:52,760 --> 00:37:53,610
Is that guys Zach,

1387
00:37:53,611 --> 00:37:54,990
he was over the other
day something we said.

1388
00:37:54,991 --> 00:37:56,100
We looked him up to see what he says.

1389
00:37:56,130 --> 00:37:58,980
He's on the silicone
valley show or something,

1390
00:37:59,180 --> 00:38:00,020
so we'd want to see what you say.

1391
00:38:00,030 --> 00:38:00,781
He's a funny guy,

1392
00:38:00,781 --> 00:38:01,614
but anyway,

1393
00:38:02,190 --> 00:38:02,701
I wanted to see,

1394
00:38:02,701 --> 00:38:03,241
what is this show?

1395
00:38:03,241 --> 00:38:03,901
Silicone Valley.

1396
00:38:03,901 --> 00:38:04,710
I never seen the show.

1397
00:38:04,710 --> 00:38:05,371
Funny show.

1398
00:38:05,371 --> 00:38:06,240
It's on HBO.

1399
00:38:06,420 --> 00:38:06,781
I've only,

1400
00:38:06,781 --> 00:38:07,920
I only watched one episode.

1401
00:38:07,921 --> 00:38:08,754
It was really funny.

1402
00:38:08,780 --> 00:38:12,510
We brought it up and there he was and
he's getting the car came to pick him up.

1403
00:38:12,570 --> 00:38:15,120
If he looks in there and there's like,

1404
00:38:15,121 --> 00:38:15,540
I said,

1405
00:38:15,540 --> 00:38:15,751
oh,

1406
00:38:15,751 --> 00:38:16,290
I said,

1407
00:38:16,290 --> 00:38:17,180
you got it in the card,

1408
00:38:17,190 --> 00:38:17,971
it's nobody in there.

1409
00:38:17,971 --> 00:38:18,301
And he says,

1410
00:38:18,301 --> 00:38:18,691
Oh yeah,

1411
00:38:18,691 --> 00:38:20,100
I'm going to wherever it was.

1412
00:38:20,130 --> 00:38:24,000
And then the car took off
all by itself driving it,

1413
00:38:24,001 --> 00:38:24,380
you know?

1414
00:38:24,380 --> 00:38:24,590
Yeah.

1415
00:38:24,590 --> 00:38:25,500
Well they're going to have that.

1416
00:38:25,620 --> 00:38:26,001
I mean they've,

1417
00:38:26,001 --> 00:38:27,540
they essentially have that now,

1418
00:38:27,550 --> 00:38:30,060
the Google cars where they're
experimenting with it and they,

1419
00:38:30,350 --> 00:38:31,650
they haven't had any accidents.

1420
00:38:32,190 --> 00:38:35,380
None of the accidents that they've been
involved with have been the Google cars

1421
00:38:35,381 --> 00:38:36,190
fault.

1422
00:38:36,190 --> 00:38:39,820
I think a few people bumped into
him jump out in front of them or no,

1423
00:38:39,821 --> 00:38:40,061
no,

1424
00:38:40,061 --> 00:38:40,301
no,

1425
00:38:40,301 --> 00:38:41,500
that they haven't hit anything,

1426
00:38:42,100 --> 00:38:43,900
but they apparently have radar.

1427
00:38:43,930 --> 00:38:45,670
They can sense when things
are in front of you.

1428
00:38:45,671 --> 00:38:46,120
I mean,

1429
00:38:46,120 --> 00:38:47,110
you've seen that in cars.

1430
00:38:47,111 --> 00:38:48,400
When you get close to
the car in front of you,

1431
00:38:48,401 --> 00:38:50,110
it'll make like a BPPP.

1432
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:51,790
I rented a car this weekend that does it.

1433
00:38:51,850 --> 00:38:53,260
They park themselves now.

1434
00:38:53,261 --> 00:38:54,040
Some cars,

1435
00:38:54,040 --> 00:38:54,371
yes,

1436
00:38:54,371 --> 00:38:55,990
they can parallel park themselves,

1437
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:56,950
park itself,

1438
00:38:56,951 --> 00:38:58,930
which is ridiculous.

1439
00:38:59,590 --> 00:39:03,160
They just decided you motherfuckers
are too stupid to do this.

1440
00:39:03,370 --> 00:39:04,420
We have to help you.

1441
00:39:05,410 --> 00:39:06,243
Excellent.

1442
00:39:06,520 --> 00:39:10,390
This is where I want the money for my
car that I'm going to buy to be invested

1443
00:39:10,391 --> 00:39:13,060
in the ability of it to then park itself.

1444
00:39:13,090 --> 00:39:13,331
It's,

1445
00:39:13,331 --> 00:39:13,751
you know what?

1446
00:39:13,751 --> 00:39:16,630
There's the thing that's going on right
now where people are trying to go retro

1447
00:39:16,631 --> 00:39:21,631
with a lot of Shit because like there's
a lot of people that like old cars now.

1448
00:39:22,090 --> 00:39:23,650
There's a lot of people that like,

1449
00:39:23,651 --> 00:39:27,010
like refurbished things because
they don't want any of that.

1450
00:39:27,070 --> 00:39:29,890
They don't want all of that interference.

1451
00:39:29,891 --> 00:39:33,970
They don't want all of that disconnect
between them and an actual machine.

1452
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:35,140
We just kept work on it.

1453
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:35,600
You're,

1454
00:39:35,600 --> 00:39:36,670
you're a car guy.

1455
00:39:36,840 --> 00:39:38,710
You look under a car lid
now you're looking at it.

1456
00:39:38,711 --> 00:39:39,160
There you go.

1457
00:39:39,160 --> 00:39:40,230
What is under here now?

1458
00:39:40,370 --> 00:39:43,180
This shit with trunk or
is the motor in here?

1459
00:39:43,181 --> 00:39:44,070
I don't even know which,

1460
00:39:44,110 --> 00:39:44,810
which,

1461
00:39:44,810 --> 00:39:45,720
which on this thing yet.

1462
00:39:45,730 --> 00:39:48,790
You know if you can pop the
hood of a 1970 Chevelle,

1463
00:39:48,820 --> 00:39:50,200
you get in that man.

1464
00:39:50,630 --> 00:39:52,060
You got a wrench out attributor cap.

1465
00:39:52,061 --> 00:39:52,841
It's right there.

1466
00:39:52,841 --> 00:39:54,040
You can grab it with your hand.

1467
00:39:54,190 --> 00:39:55,210
There's your oil filter.

1468
00:39:55,211 --> 00:39:57,450
You could hold onto it cause the dipstick,

1469
00:39:57,460 --> 00:39:59,680
you could see how much
oil is in there with us.

1470
00:40:00,600 --> 00:40:01,810
You've got computers,

1471
00:40:01,811 --> 00:40:02,644
you have to run it.

1472
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:03,680
Shut it off.

1473
00:40:03,681 --> 00:40:04,391
Cancers guy.

1474
00:40:04,391 --> 00:40:05,380
You have to have a guy.

1475
00:40:05,410 --> 00:40:05,890
Yeah,

1476
00:40:05,890 --> 00:40:06,640
you have to have a gun.

1477
00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:09,100
The think a computer
can go wacky on you too.

1478
00:40:09,130 --> 00:40:10,240
That also can happen.

1479
00:40:10,440 --> 00:40:11,530
That happens occasionally.

1480
00:40:12,190 --> 00:40:14,110
I mean obviously this is
mechanical breakdown too,

1481
00:40:14,111 --> 00:40:15,490
but computers can go,

1482
00:40:15,510 --> 00:40:15,890
wow,

1483
00:40:15,890 --> 00:40:17,050
you're a guy's guy.

1484
00:40:17,590 --> 00:40:19,960
After you get a guy then
he has to have a guy said,

1485
00:40:19,961 --> 00:40:20,141
hey,

1486
00:40:20,141 --> 00:40:21,130
oh yeah,

1487
00:40:21,131 --> 00:40:22,650
my stuff isn't correctly.

1488
00:40:22,850 --> 00:40:26,950
But on the flip side you
have navigation screens,

1489
00:40:27,190 --> 00:40:28,930
you have backup cameras,

1490
00:40:28,931 --> 00:40:31,630
you have all this cool shit
that electronics provide to.

1491
00:40:31,930 --> 00:40:32,141
It's,

1492
00:40:32,141 --> 00:40:33,340
I see both sides of it.

1493
00:40:33,341 --> 00:40:38,200
But like I do see like the appeal
of like driving an old VW bug,

1494
00:40:38,440 --> 00:40:40,750
like a VW bug from like 1970,

1495
00:40:40,751 --> 00:40:42,130
not much horsepower or anything,

1496
00:40:42,131 --> 00:40:42,821
but man,

1497
00:40:42,821 --> 00:40:43,330
what a,

1498
00:40:43,330 --> 00:40:46,030
what a connection you have to
the road with that piece of shit.

1499
00:40:46,270 --> 00:40:47,103
You know,

1500
00:40:47,230 --> 00:40:48,640
it's not good at handling,

1501
00:40:48,641 --> 00:40:49,690
it doesn't have good brakes,

1502
00:40:49,930 --> 00:40:50,860
but you know,

1503
00:40:50,861 --> 00:40:51,611
when you see one,

1504
00:40:51,611 --> 00:40:53,420
this is like a little bit and driving it.

1505
00:40:53,500 --> 00:40:53,771
Yeah.

1506
00:40:53,771 --> 00:40:56,240
I wish I could drive one of the
greater good of the project.

1507
00:40:56,430 --> 00:40:58,330
My friend Jimmy had when
we were in high school,

1508
00:40:58,570 --> 00:40:59,410
I was an idiot.

1509
00:40:59,411 --> 00:41:03,760
I always had muscle cars and my friend
Jimmy had this VW bug and it was like,

1510
00:41:03,790 --> 00:41:04,121
you know,

1511
00:41:04,121 --> 00:41:04,361
we,

1512
00:41:04,361 --> 00:41:04,901
like I said,

1513
00:41:04,901 --> 00:41:06,490
this is right out of high school.

1514
00:41:06,491 --> 00:41:06,780
So I,

1515
00:41:06,780 --> 00:41:09,490
I graduated in 85 and
Jimmy was ahead of me.

1516
00:41:09,820 --> 00:41:13,240
And so I think that it was probably like
1986 or something along those lines.

1517
00:41:13,540 --> 00:41:14,350
And uh,

1518
00:41:14,350 --> 00:41:19,120
he had this 1960 something bug or 69 bug,

1519
00:41:19,990 --> 00:41:21,970
ugly light blue,

1520
00:41:22,270 --> 00:41:22,661
you know.

1521
00:41:22,661 --> 00:41:23,590
But it was great.

1522
00:41:23,890 --> 00:41:25,110
It was something cool about it.

1523
00:41:25,111 --> 00:41:28,870
It was like we had a big smile on our
face when we're driving around in it.

1524
00:41:29,110 --> 00:41:30,280
You know there was something about,

1525
00:41:30,670 --> 00:41:31,503
yeah,

1526
00:41:31,600 --> 00:41:32,650
first of all he's like,

1527
00:41:32,740 --> 00:41:34,250
you know macho guy

1528
00:41:34,580 --> 00:41:36,350
and a is a construction worker.

1529
00:41:36,380 --> 00:41:37,880
He's just really smart dude too though.

1530
00:41:37,881 --> 00:41:41,840
So he got himself a fucking
VW bug and he's like,

1531
00:41:41,841 --> 00:41:45,260
it gets great gas mileage but like the
wind would blow and the car would move.

1532
00:41:45,740 --> 00:41:48,350
Like you could feel the car
moving if a good breeze hit it.

1533
00:41:48,410 --> 00:41:50,960
Like she'll fucking cars
moving from the wind man.

1534
00:41:51,230 --> 00:41:53,000
Like what do we do and
we're going to go cart.

1535
00:41:53,450 --> 00:41:53,691
Yeah,

1536
00:41:53,691 --> 00:41:54,800
they do handle better now.

1537
00:41:54,801 --> 00:41:55,460
Cars.

1538
00:41:55,460 --> 00:41:56,310
Oh one time.

1539
00:41:56,410 --> 00:41:57,243
That's,

1540
00:41:57,440 --> 00:41:58,790
that's the understatement of the year.

1541
00:41:58,810 --> 00:41:59,310
Snowboard,

1542
00:41:59,310 --> 00:42:00,143
right go.

1543
00:42:00,920 --> 00:42:02,240
Amazing prize by break.

1544
00:42:02,241 --> 00:42:07,220
I had to stop from like 65 to zero like
like on the freeway the other day and it

1545
00:42:07,221 --> 00:42:08,220
just was like,

1546
00:42:09,710 --> 00:42:09,891
no,

1547
00:42:09,891 --> 00:42:10,880
you have the tweet,

1548
00:42:11,160 --> 00:42:13,770
that sweet new Volkswagen that's like,

1549
00:42:13,830 --> 00:42:14,630
or it's perfect.

1550
00:42:14,630 --> 00:42:17,210
I forgot you had that perfect
contrast to the Volkswagen.

1551
00:42:17,211 --> 00:42:20,090
Then we were talking to him about it
because my friend Jimmy's Volkswagen was

1552
00:42:20,091 --> 00:42:21,770
like super old school.

1553
00:42:21,770 --> 00:42:23,810
Like that lawn mower engine.

1554
00:42:23,840 --> 00:42:26,060
It sounds like a lawnmower
or sewing machine.

1555
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:27,233
Yeah.

1556
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:27,621
Oh yeah.

1557
00:42:27,621 --> 00:42:28,431
You'd have to pump the brakes,

1558
00:42:28,431 --> 00:42:30,530
but it was like a really light tiny car.

1559
00:42:30,710 --> 00:42:31,610
Where's the new one?

1560
00:42:31,611 --> 00:42:33,960
Like we're saying it looks
like a like a fat Porsche.

1561
00:42:34,430 --> 00:42:37,790
It looks like a like some sort of a
space shit like an Audi or something like

1562
00:42:37,791 --> 00:42:38,390
that.

1563
00:42:38,390 --> 00:42:40,700
The new VW bug is pretty dope looking.

1564
00:42:40,980 --> 00:42:41,310
They,

1565
00:42:41,310 --> 00:42:44,480
they pretty much redesign it for guys
and they got rid of all the girls shit in

1566
00:42:44,481 --> 00:42:44,900
it like that.

1567
00:42:44,900 --> 00:42:46,850
The flower ponds and shit like that.

1568
00:42:46,851 --> 00:42:48,140
That used to be in the old ones,

1569
00:42:48,160 --> 00:42:52,760
like more ones that look like bubbles
and it's a perfect example of a car that

1570
00:42:52,761 --> 00:42:55,470
like shows the improvement
of today's cars because the,

1571
00:42:55,520 --> 00:43:00,520
the performance and handling of a VW
bug is better than like a 1970 Portia.

1572
00:43:01,940 --> 00:43:06,740
If you got a Porsche from
1970 those bitches had like
skinny ass steering wheels

1573
00:43:06,741 --> 00:43:10,790
that were big like Hula hoops
and get shitty ass skinny tires.

1574
00:43:10,790 --> 00:43:11,470
Like they,

1575
00:43:11,470 --> 00:43:12,710
they didn't handle that well.

1576
00:43:12,770 --> 00:43:16,820
They just weren't that good in comparison
to like what your car could do if you

1577
00:43:16,970 --> 00:43:19,010
brought your car back in time.

1578
00:43:19,190 --> 00:43:22,310
Like when they had the 1969 Porsche
and you showed them your car,

1579
00:43:22,311 --> 00:43:24,560
they'd be fucking blowing you.

1580
00:43:24,690 --> 00:43:27,050
It was gonna be like you're
a wizard from the future.

1581
00:43:27,290 --> 00:43:27,561
Yeah.

1582
00:43:27,561 --> 00:43:29,330
This is the 2014 turbo.

1583
00:43:29,331 --> 00:43:30,081
I have this car,

1584
00:43:30,081 --> 00:43:32,830
but doesn't it have like 250
horsepower or something like that?

1585
00:43:32,840 --> 00:43:33,770
They just put a new engine in it.

1586
00:43:33,771 --> 00:43:34,960
I forget what exactly it is.

1587
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:36,113
Fuck fat.

1588
00:43:36,490 --> 00:43:37,710
Like that was a big deal.

1589
00:43:37,711 --> 00:43:38,121
Like to have,

1590
00:43:38,121 --> 00:43:42,260
I mean that would be a little bit
heavier than an old Porsche for sure,

1591
00:43:42,980 --> 00:43:46,850
but if you could get that kind
of horsepower in an old car,

1592
00:43:46,851 --> 00:43:47,840
I mean that's ridiculous.

1593
00:43:48,170 --> 00:43:49,660
Like they have these new mustangs,

1594
00:43:49,670 --> 00:43:50,960
the Mustang Gt,

1595
00:43:50,961 --> 00:43:55,961
the new one that's out just straight
Mustang gt has like 450 fucking horsepower

1596
00:43:58,401 --> 00:43:59,570
or something crazy like that.

1597
00:43:59,630 --> 00:44:00,830
There's songs out to people on.

1598
00:44:00,890 --> 00:44:01,161
Oh yeah,

1599
00:44:01,161 --> 00:44:02,800
but that's like their basic car.

1600
00:44:02,840 --> 00:44:06,590
Then they have a Shelby that comes out
later that's going to have more than 600

1601
00:44:06,591 --> 00:44:11,480
horsepower like that wasn't accessible
back in 1970 second place to go drive

1602
00:44:11,481 --> 00:44:12,051
these things.

1603
00:44:12,051 --> 00:44:12,201
Say,

1604
00:44:12,201 --> 00:44:12,770
hey look,

1605
00:44:12,770 --> 00:44:16,640
we got a place you can go drive it to
get something even remotely as fast in

1606
00:44:16,641 --> 00:44:19,130
like 1970 you had a special order shit.

1607
00:44:19,160 --> 00:44:20,360
You had to go to a mechanic,

1608
00:44:20,570 --> 00:44:23,630
you got to find some dude who knows
how to put in nitrous on a car,

1609
00:44:23,930 --> 00:44:25,160
but now you get his buy it.

1610
00:44:25,990 --> 00:44:27,680
They allow people to
have something like that.

1611
00:44:27,710 --> 00:44:27,941
Well,

1612
00:44:27,941 --> 00:44:32,090
it's just a faction of what
we're doing at faction.

1613
00:44:32,110 --> 00:44:35,580
This can can continual improvement.

1614
00:44:35,610 --> 00:44:35,941
This,

1615
00:44:35,941 --> 00:44:39,600
it's a a a process and it's
a product of those things.

1616
00:44:39,601 --> 00:44:43,860
It's a product of this
continual improvement and it's
a product of our constant

1617
00:44:43,861 --> 00:44:45,300
desire for new shit.

1618
00:44:45,720 --> 00:44:50,720
We want the car that does zero to 60 in
3.4 because the car does zero to 60 in

1619
00:44:51,091 --> 00:44:54,360
3.6 is outdated and you look at the specs,

1620
00:44:54,570 --> 00:44:54,841
oh,

1621
00:44:54,841 --> 00:44:59,340
this car went around the Nurburgring
and seven minutes and 25 seconds.

1622
00:44:59,730 --> 00:45:00,780
People Freak out.

1623
00:45:00,810 --> 00:45:01,111
They go,

1624
00:45:01,111 --> 00:45:03,820
I can't believe that my car
does it in seven 40 my car

1625
00:45:03,970 --> 00:45:04,803
piece of shit.

1626
00:45:06,400 --> 00:45:06,821
You're like,

1627
00:45:06,821 --> 00:45:07,271
asshole,

1628
00:45:07,271 --> 00:45:10,390
you're not going around the Nurburgring
like what are you doing man?

1629
00:45:10,750 --> 00:45:13,210
Like if you drove my
friend Jimmy's Vw bug,

1630
00:45:13,480 --> 00:45:18,480
that might make you feel better than
driving some ridiculous car that goes zero

1631
00:45:18,641 --> 00:45:22,240
to 60 in two seconds
and corners at two g's.

1632
00:45:22,690 --> 00:45:24,870
You know it well,

1633
00:45:24,910 --> 00:45:25,571
it's a certain,

1634
00:45:25,571 --> 00:45:26,590
a certain part of that.

1635
00:45:26,591 --> 00:45:28,030
You'll lose the fun.

1636
00:45:28,240 --> 00:45:29,470
There's like a fun and driving.

1637
00:45:29,680 --> 00:45:32,680
You know there's a guy named Dario,

1638
00:45:32,680 --> 00:45:32,681
Fran Cheaty,

1639
00:45:32,681 --> 00:45:33,700
I think you say his name.

1640
00:45:33,701 --> 00:45:37,870
He's a race car driver and he drives a,

1641
00:45:37,900 --> 00:45:38,201
his,

1642
00:45:38,201 --> 00:45:38,650
his,

1643
00:45:38,650 --> 00:45:40,900
his cardio is fun car to drive.

1644
00:45:41,120 --> 00:45:45,910
He's like a 1973 Porsche
with like a big engine in it.

1645
00:45:45,911 --> 00:45:48,690
He put like a more modern
engine in 1973 boards.

1646
00:45:48,910 --> 00:45:53,170
Like he could get like a vague Iran or
any of these like super complicated cars

1647
00:45:53,171 --> 00:45:54,070
they're making today.

1648
00:45:54,160 --> 00:45:58,420
But a guy who's an actual race car driver
decided to go for like the gritty feel

1649
00:45:58,421 --> 00:46:01,220
of an old car combined
with modern technology.

1650
00:46:01,221 --> 00:46:02,320
He's a very smart guy,

1651
00:46:02,590 --> 00:46:02,801
you know,

1652
00:46:02,801 --> 00:46:05,170
he's like all these zero to
60 times she goes is yes,

1653
00:46:05,171 --> 00:46:08,590
it's important where your race car driving
but not for the pleasure of driving.

1654
00:46:09,100 --> 00:46:10,350
So that's the guy listened to.

1655
00:46:10,910 --> 00:46:11,591
I mean that's the guy,

1656
00:46:11,591 --> 00:46:13,000
he does it for a living.

1657
00:46:13,030 --> 00:46:17,800
So if he chooses to drive like
an old car that like really,

1658
00:46:17,801 --> 00:46:19,120
you really feel everything,

1659
00:46:19,390 --> 00:46:20,730
that's probably the most pleasure.

1660
00:46:20,731 --> 00:46:21,490
A lot of merit.

1661
00:46:21,490 --> 00:46:21,731
Yeah.

1662
00:46:21,731 --> 00:46:26,680
We like pass the pleasurable point and
went to some weird numb point with cars

1663
00:46:26,681 --> 00:46:29,770
where the stealings like this and
you don't feel any of the bumps,

1664
00:46:29,800 --> 00:46:30,131
you know?

1665
00:46:30,131 --> 00:46:31,210
It's weird.

1666
00:46:31,330 --> 00:46:31,690
Yeah.

1667
00:46:31,690 --> 00:46:33,350
It's not organic.

1668
00:46:33,351 --> 00:46:33,910
You know,

1669
00:46:33,910 --> 00:46:35,170
it's kind of not organic.

1670
00:46:35,171 --> 00:46:36,700
It's not very Mumford and sons.

1671
00:46:36,900 --> 00:46:37,733
Yeah.

1672
00:46:39,040 --> 00:46:39,851
It's not very,

1673
00:46:39,851 --> 00:46:40,250
uh,

1674
00:46:40,250 --> 00:46:40,470
yeah.

1675
00:46:40,470 --> 00:46:41,690
That's the trend today.

1676
00:46:41,930 --> 00:46:44,570
The trend today is to go
with like a handmade clock,

1677
00:46:44,860 --> 00:46:45,230
you know,

1678
00:46:45,230 --> 00:46:45,441
like,

1679
00:46:45,441 --> 00:46:46,280
oh see that clock.

1680
00:46:46,281 --> 00:46:46,971
It was handmade.

1681
00:46:46,971 --> 00:46:47,450
And people like,

1682
00:46:47,450 --> 00:46:48,020
Ooh,

1683
00:46:48,020 --> 00:46:48,231
you know,

1684
00:46:48,231 --> 00:46:52,790
there's something cool about that as
opposed to like if you lived in 1970 and

1685
00:46:52,791 --> 00:46:53,900
you've got a digital clock,

1686
00:46:53,901 --> 00:46:55,160
you were the pimp of the year.

1687
00:46:55,430 --> 00:46:56,130
Like this guy said,

1688
00:46:56,130 --> 00:46:57,260
digital clock in his house,

1689
00:46:58,750 --> 00:47:01,720
you go over a dude's house and
he had digital alarm clock.

1690
00:47:01,721 --> 00:47:05,590
He would like this motherfucker's got a
digital alarm clock and it was to raise

1691
00:47:05,610 --> 00:47:06,630
a microwave oven.

1692
00:47:08,110 --> 00:47:08,760
Ellie.

1693
00:47:08,760 --> 00:47:09,593
Yeah.

1694
00:47:09,690 --> 00:47:10,381
Yeah man.

1695
00:47:10,381 --> 00:47:12,480
I remember going over people's
houses and they had that.

1696
00:47:12,481 --> 00:47:12,930
I was,

1697
00:47:12,930 --> 00:47:14,730
I couldn't believe I was looking at it.

1698
00:47:14,820 --> 00:47:15,653
I was looking at,

1699
00:47:16,120 --> 00:47:17,280
then he came in to watch.

1700
00:47:17,340 --> 00:47:17,891
Yeah.

1701
00:47:17,891 --> 00:47:20,520
At first I got the clock in your
house and put it on your hand.

1702
00:47:21,610 --> 00:47:21,871
Pam.

1703
00:47:21,871 --> 00:47:23,440
Six 44 ethic.

1704
00:47:23,550 --> 00:47:24,383
That's what people are saying.

1705
00:47:24,420 --> 00:47:24,541
Hey,

1706
00:47:24,541 --> 00:47:25,374
what time is it?

1707
00:47:25,440 --> 00:47:25,621
Oh,

1708
00:47:25,621 --> 00:47:30,070
it's seven 60 and remember
the batteries were such dog

1709
00:47:30,070 --> 00:47:31,000
shit that you,

1710
00:47:31,020 --> 00:47:35,320
you had to press it to find the time and
then you'd let it go and fuck your time

1711
00:47:35,321 --> 00:47:37,660
would go by president.

1712
00:47:37,810 --> 00:47:40,600
It didn't just stay on because it was,

1713
00:47:40,630 --> 00:47:43,180
the batteries were dog shit back then.

1714
00:47:43,490 --> 00:47:43,930
You know,

1715
00:47:43,930 --> 00:47:45,140
if it was going to stay on it,

1716
00:47:45,141 --> 00:47:47,020
we had to be like a a foot thick.

1717
00:47:47,080 --> 00:47:48,550
The battery for that back then.

1718
00:47:48,551 --> 00:47:48,940
Yeah.

1719
00:47:48,940 --> 00:47:51,130
I mean there's batteries
were just dog shit,

1720
00:47:51,131 --> 00:47:52,120
but I never thought about that.

1721
00:47:52,870 --> 00:47:53,740
I mean those were,

1722
00:47:53,850 --> 00:47:58,720
it's remember the calculator watch for
some reason that one never took off.

1723
00:47:58,990 --> 00:48:01,360
He took off and it got to a
certain point and people are like,

1724
00:48:01,361 --> 00:48:01,541
wait,

1725
00:48:01,541 --> 00:48:01,721
wait,

1726
00:48:01,721 --> 00:48:01,871
wait,

1727
00:48:01,871 --> 00:48:02,041
wait.

1728
00:48:02,041 --> 00:48:02,590
What the,

1729
00:48:02,590 --> 00:48:04,150
how often am I counting shit.

1730
00:48:06,190 --> 00:48:07,330
They've got the calculator phone.

1731
00:48:08,030 --> 00:48:09,280
Your phone is kind of a computer.

1732
00:48:09,281 --> 00:48:11,290
That's a one device choice.

1733
00:48:12,100 --> 00:48:13,060
You better off with a compass.

1734
00:48:13,061 --> 00:48:13,751
What if you get lost?

1735
00:48:13,751 --> 00:48:14,740
All you got is a fucking tie.

1736
00:48:15,150 --> 00:48:16,180
Calculate a bitch.

1737
00:48:16,600 --> 00:48:18,450
Calculators not going to help
you if you're lost in the woods.

1738
00:48:18,700 --> 00:48:18,941
Boy,

1739
00:48:18,941 --> 00:48:19,774
yeah,

1740
00:48:19,860 --> 00:48:21,490
you have something to make some fire.

1741
00:48:21,520 --> 00:48:22,120
Yeah.

1742
00:48:22,120 --> 00:48:23,620
Why do you got to fucking calculator?

1743
00:48:24,100 --> 00:48:28,660
Not that as our first development here
and it's also the calculator watch was

1744
00:48:28,661 --> 00:48:31,600
invented with calculators
were only like that big like,

1745
00:48:31,930 --> 00:48:32,530
I mean,

1746
00:48:32,530 --> 00:48:33,490
what the fuck are you doing?

1747
00:48:33,640 --> 00:48:34,750
How often is that coming up?

1748
00:48:35,180 --> 00:48:38,140
Except this is the one thing that I
know people were probably yelling at me

1749
00:48:38,141 --> 00:48:40,570
right now except people
cheating in school.

1750
00:48:40,630 --> 00:48:42,130
I bet there was a window.

1751
00:48:42,400 --> 00:48:47,040
I bet there was a small window where
teachers are still fucking old people who

1752
00:48:47,041 --> 00:48:47,540
are there.

1753
00:48:47,540 --> 00:48:50,530
They're out of touch with modern
technology and a lot of ways.

1754
00:48:50,650 --> 00:48:53,560
So there's probably a window with these
young little rascals went in there with

1755
00:48:53,561 --> 00:48:57,850
their technological wizard phones
with calculators on and they probably,

1756
00:48:58,000 --> 00:48:59,390
I remember doing that totally.

1757
00:49:00,310 --> 00:49:02,170
How long was it before
they were made illegal?

1758
00:49:02,171 --> 00:49:03,004
Do you remember that

1759
00:49:03,210 --> 00:49:04,030
he ever really wear,

1760
00:49:04,030 --> 00:49:06,690
I don't think they ever actually caught
on because you were always allowed to

1761
00:49:06,691 --> 00:49:09,090
use like calculators to cheat in school.

1762
00:49:09,091 --> 00:49:12,660
There was this big Tia 81 Texas
instrument ones that you had to buy.

1763
00:49:12,661 --> 00:49:15,120
Remember this huge calculators
and you used to be,

1764
00:49:15,150 --> 00:49:18,390
there was a note field kind of where you
can just sit there and write all these

1765
00:49:18,391 --> 00:49:21,900
like pro like answers to
questions in the calculator.

1766
00:49:22,050 --> 00:49:24,000
And the teachers never
caught on for us on that.

1767
00:49:24,030 --> 00:49:24,863
We just opened up all,

1768
00:49:24,870 --> 00:49:27,210
everyone would open up their calculators
and look at our notes on there.

1769
00:49:27,690 --> 00:49:28,590
Oh no,

1770
00:49:29,070 --> 00:49:29,940
that's hilarious.

1771
00:49:29,941 --> 00:49:30,100
Yeah,

1772
00:49:30,100 --> 00:49:30,871
so it was like,

1773
00:49:30,871 --> 00:49:33,270
I'm like a a note
function on a smartphone.

1774
00:49:33,300 --> 00:49:33,541
Yeah.

1775
00:49:33,541 --> 00:49:34,320
Yeah.

1776
00:49:34,320 --> 00:49:34,980
That's hilarious.

1777
00:49:34,980 --> 00:49:35,431
It was.

1778
00:49:35,431 --> 00:49:36,420
It was like the beginning of that.

1779
00:49:36,421 --> 00:49:40,110
But I remember calculator watches like
we had them and I don't ever remember

1780
00:49:40,111 --> 00:49:41,430
being told not to wear it.

1781
00:49:41,460 --> 00:49:42,360
Like I don't think the,

1782
00:49:42,510 --> 00:49:44,250
even the math teachers
even figured it out.

1783
00:49:44,360 --> 00:49:44,810
Well let's,

1784
00:49:44,810 --> 00:49:46,370
let's Google that to find out.

1785
00:49:46,610 --> 00:49:50,030
Cause I would think that the only way
to get good at math if you're going to

1786
00:49:50,031 --> 00:49:53,030
really get good at math is you
have to actually do it right?

1787
00:49:53,060 --> 00:49:53,691
I mean yeah,

1788
00:49:53,691 --> 00:49:55,190
math is something that's fun to do.

1789
00:49:55,220 --> 00:49:56,840
I mean I think when the
question is terrible,

1790
00:49:56,841 --> 00:49:58,100
he just lost all credibility.

1791
00:49:59,030 --> 00:50:01,010
I don't know who you are
and what you just said.

1792
00:50:02,240 --> 00:50:04,520
I like it because it's
like always the same way.

1793
00:50:05,690 --> 00:50:07,020
Watch this spelling.

1794
00:50:07,140 --> 00:50:09,140
But then you start getting
into triangles and shit.

1795
00:50:09,141 --> 00:50:09,950
He needs that.

1796
00:50:09,950 --> 00:50:12,010
Well that's specialized mathematical,

1797
00:50:12,510 --> 00:50:13,890
just like addition man.

1798
00:50:14,570 --> 00:50:16,340
It's like Harry Potter Science,

1799
00:50:16,640 --> 00:50:17,391
like those guys,

1800
00:50:17,391 --> 00:50:18,224
the quantum,

1801
00:50:18,230 --> 00:50:22,280
the quantum deep into the
quantum consciousness as I
liked those guys that say

1802
00:50:22,281 --> 00:50:23,930
shit that I can't understand it all.

1803
00:50:24,020 --> 00:50:25,520
I love when they're talking
to that kind of math,

1804
00:50:25,730 --> 00:50:29,360
when they show me those
mathematical and you just go,

1805
00:50:29,361 --> 00:50:30,500
what is that?

1806
00:50:30,501 --> 00:50:31,490
An alien language.

1807
00:50:31,491 --> 00:50:31,641
Like,

1808
00:50:31,641 --> 00:50:32,121
what is that?

1809
00:50:32,121 --> 00:50:33,170
I have no idea what that is.

1810
00:50:33,290 --> 00:50:34,640
Those guys fascinated me in the movie.

1811
00:50:34,960 --> 00:50:35,793
They see that the,

1812
00:50:35,840 --> 00:50:38,160
there's a cartoon where
they're all looking at that,

1813
00:50:38,310 --> 00:50:41,330
the big formula on the chalkboard
or over there and they're going,

1814
00:50:41,340 --> 00:50:42,173
huh?

1815
00:50:42,590 --> 00:50:44,120
Cause there's a humor.

1816
00:50:44,340 --> 00:50:45,800
Some are in the normal,

1817
00:50:46,270 --> 00:50:49,970
there was the joke in the a formula
that a irregular persons knocking.

1818
00:50:50,780 --> 00:50:51,411
It's not funny.

1819
00:50:51,411 --> 00:50:52,244
You know

1820
00:50:52,260 --> 00:50:52,450
Joe,

1821
00:50:52,450 --> 00:50:53,300
do you remember glacier?

1822
00:50:53,301 --> 00:50:54,830
I think they're called glacier glasses.

1823
00:50:54,831 --> 00:50:55,190
They can't,

1824
00:50:55,190 --> 00:50:56,600
there were out around the same time.

1825
00:50:56,630 --> 00:50:57,350
There were like,

1826
00:50:57,350 --> 00:50:58,970
like circle glasses,

1827
00:50:58,971 --> 00:51:01,910
but then they had this little leather
piece that went on the side and then like

1828
00:51:01,930 --> 00:51:02,100
the,

1829
00:51:02,100 --> 00:51:06,230
the arms were like may not a rubber and
they were really popular for like two

1830
00:51:06,231 --> 00:51:08,300
years in the early eighties
and they were like,

1831
00:51:08,770 --> 00:51:09,603
I missed the,

1832
00:51:09,610 --> 00:51:11,050
I didn't hang out with
any of those people.

1833
00:51:12,280 --> 00:51:14,200
Look at Google calculator,

1834
00:51:14,201 --> 00:51:14,860
watch Matt.

1835
00:51:14,860 --> 00:51:16,180
It's actually pretty trippy.

1836
00:51:16,690 --> 00:51:19,510
They came out with one in 1975 man,

1837
00:51:20,410 --> 00:51:21,243
none nuts.

1838
00:51:21,910 --> 00:51:25,690
I had one in one of the one really
eighties calculator watch were first.

1839
00:51:25,740 --> 00:51:30,740
It were first introduced in the 1970s
and despite enjoying a heyday during the

1840
00:51:30,821 --> 00:51:33,010
1980s continued to be produced.

1841
00:51:33,280 --> 00:51:36,490
The most notable brand
is Casio databank series.

1842
00:51:37,090 --> 00:51:39,280
The watches were buy Timex.

1843
00:51:39,430 --> 00:51:40,270
We're also popular.

1844
00:51:40,860 --> 00:51:42,100
There's a Wikipedia,

1845
00:51:42,130 --> 00:51:45,140
but Brian has a Wikipedia where you
could see all the old ones there.

1846
00:51:45,340 --> 00:51:46,240
It's a trip,

1847
00:51:46,241 --> 00:51:47,074
man.

1848
00:51:47,740 --> 00:51:49,240
It's really fascinating.

1849
00:51:49,510 --> 00:51:52,000
Like I forgot how silly
these things where,

1850
00:51:52,770 --> 00:51:53,603
Oh yeah,

1851
00:51:53,680 --> 00:51:54,161
look at those.

1852
00:51:54,161 --> 00:51:56,320
We'll look at the one down looking
at the one even further down.

1853
00:51:56,350 --> 00:51:57,183
Look at that thing.

1854
00:51:57,630 --> 00:51:59,040
How do you get your
finger on one of those?

1855
00:51:59,060 --> 00:52:00,850
But that's all you got to get a little.

1856
00:52:00,850 --> 00:52:01,631
Remember that at all.

1857
00:52:01,631 --> 00:52:03,730
But with that is the future of ad.

1858
00:52:03,731 --> 00:52:04,960
If you had one of those,

1859
00:52:04,990 --> 00:52:06,970
you could totally get star wars.

1860
00:52:06,971 --> 00:52:07,804
Chicks.

1861
00:52:08,110 --> 00:52:09,700
Chicks are like really into star wars.

1862
00:52:09,730 --> 00:52:11,260
They would think you were so cool.

1863
00:52:12,910 --> 00:52:16,000
He's got a fucking calculator on his rest.

1864
00:52:17,480 --> 00:52:18,490
It's so future.

1865
00:52:18,970 --> 00:52:19,960
It's so space.

1866
00:52:20,890 --> 00:52:21,340
Yeah.

1867
00:52:21,340 --> 00:52:22,210
That didn't work out.

1868
00:52:22,240 --> 00:52:23,260
We didn't give a fuck anymore.

1869
00:52:23,410 --> 00:52:24,790
Now people went back to dials.

1870
00:52:24,940 --> 00:52:27,430
You know like if your car is fancy,

1871
00:52:27,730 --> 00:52:29,740
your car has an old school clock on it.

1872
00:52:29,741 --> 00:52:31,780
Like if you buy a Lexus
or something like that,

1873
00:52:31,960 --> 00:52:33,790
they'll have like a nice clock in it.

1874
00:52:33,960 --> 00:52:35,830
Like an actual tick tick tock.

1875
00:52:35,831 --> 00:52:36,270
Yeah,

1876
00:52:36,270 --> 00:52:37,031
and it's to show you,

1877
00:52:37,031 --> 00:52:38,740
this is a luxury item sir.

1878
00:52:39,400 --> 00:52:40,660
There's no digital clocks in here,

1879
00:52:40,661 --> 00:52:40,901
sir.

1880
00:52:40,901 --> 00:52:42,370
This is a luxury item

1881
00:52:44,590 --> 00:52:45,423
isn't it?

1882
00:52:45,580 --> 00:52:48,160
Is it is just a thing that tells the
time like what the fuck is going on here?

1883
00:52:48,250 --> 00:52:49,300
Something's going on here.

1884
00:52:49,810 --> 00:52:51,040
If you have a tick tock,

1885
00:52:51,041 --> 00:52:51,431
tick tock,

1886
00:52:51,431 --> 00:52:51,791
tick tock,

1887
00:52:51,791 --> 00:52:52,624
it's fancy.

1888
00:52:52,690 --> 00:52:53,523
See this?

1889
00:52:54,340 --> 00:52:55,240
This is fancy.

1890
00:52:56,680 --> 00:52:57,990
This is fancy and can't hear.

1891
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:03,000
This is how I know what time where I look
at my computer go away or the computer

1892
00:53:03,921 --> 00:53:05,350
or was he a digital numbers?

1893
00:53:05,360 --> 00:53:06,430
Your exact numbers.

1894
00:53:06,431 --> 00:53:07,300
I like looking at it.

1895
00:53:07,301 --> 00:53:08,790
We the court Sansi too,

1896
00:53:08,810 --> 00:53:09,340
right?

1897
00:53:09,340 --> 00:53:10,121
I don't know what's in there.

1898
00:53:10,121 --> 00:53:11,320
I got that shit at target.

1899
00:53:12,190 --> 00:53:13,120
I don't know what it is.

1900
00:53:13,150 --> 00:53:14,110
It's just a clock,

1901
00:53:14,440 --> 00:53:16,600
but I like looking at a
clock for whatever reason.

1902
00:53:16,601 --> 00:53:20,560
It gives me a better sense of what
time is that when I look at a number,

1903
00:53:20,770 --> 00:53:23,710
when I look at numbers and
it's totally illogical,

1904
00:53:23,800 --> 00:53:25,000
but I look at this number,

1905
00:53:25,140 --> 00:53:25,861
my computer,

1906
00:53:25,861 --> 00:53:28,290
the upper left hand or upper
right hand corner of my computer,

1907
00:53:28,440 --> 00:53:29,131
and then I look at that,

1908
00:53:29,131 --> 00:53:31,170
that's more pleasurable
to me for whatever reason.

1909
00:53:32,430 --> 00:53:33,490
That's an interesting uh,

1910
00:53:33,660 --> 00:53:34,493
evaluation.

1911
00:53:35,070 --> 00:53:38,370
I think I have a more natural
sense of analog thing.

1912
00:53:38,400 --> 00:53:38,670
Yeah.

1913
00:53:38,670 --> 00:53:38,841
You know,

1914
00:53:38,841 --> 00:53:42,360
the way analog is better than tape to
you listening to recordings and so forth

1915
00:53:42,361 --> 00:53:42,751
like that.

1916
00:53:42,751 --> 00:53:43,584
A lot of times,

1917
00:53:44,060 --> 00:53:44,401
you know,

1918
00:53:44,401 --> 00:53:45,610
it used to record and uh,

1919
00:53:45,660 --> 00:53:45,960
you know,

1920
00:53:45,960 --> 00:53:47,670
analog and then they went to digital,

1921
00:53:47,671 --> 00:53:49,140
came out Kinda then.

1922
00:53:49,280 --> 00:53:50,730
Then what they would do
is they'll go digital,

1923
00:53:50,760 --> 00:53:51,301
analog,

1924
00:53:51,301 --> 00:53:53,250
digital and then back to analog.

1925
00:53:53,280 --> 00:53:54,113
Yeah.

1926
00:53:54,150 --> 00:53:55,980
Try to mix this stuff
up to where it sounds.

1927
00:53:56,010 --> 00:53:56,520
Uh,

1928
00:53:56,520 --> 00:53:57,480
and I fully understand that.

1929
00:53:57,481 --> 00:53:58,890
For some folks it's the opposite.

1930
00:53:58,920 --> 00:54:00,420
Some folks they don't like that,

1931
00:54:00,450 --> 00:54:01,590
that's not pleasing to them,

1932
00:54:01,591 --> 00:54:02,580
but they love the numbers.

1933
00:54:02,760 --> 00:54:03,070
Some,

1934
00:54:03,070 --> 00:54:04,020
I mean it's all different.

1935
00:54:04,021 --> 00:54:05,070
It's just me personally.

1936
00:54:05,071 --> 00:54:07,230
That's how I always feel when I,

1937
00:54:07,410 --> 00:54:09,270
I would way rather look at like a,

1938
00:54:09,600 --> 00:54:11,220
I think clocks are kind of cool.

1939
00:54:11,550 --> 00:54:12,780
Whenever I look at a watch,

1940
00:54:13,440 --> 00:54:14,273
pardon me goes,

1941
00:54:14,280 --> 00:54:14,920
oh that's cool.

1942
00:54:14,920 --> 00:54:18,150
Can Watch the other part
of me instantaneously goes,

1943
00:54:18,390 --> 00:54:19,840
it is so God damn fascinating.

1944
00:54:19,870 --> 00:54:21,570
There's a bunch of moving parts in there.

1945
00:54:21,660 --> 00:54:22,110
Amazing.

1946
00:54:22,110 --> 00:54:23,790
That's spin and took like,

1947
00:54:24,240 --> 00:54:26,310
I'm not a fan of expensive watches,

1948
00:54:26,370 --> 00:54:26,731
I'm not,

1949
00:54:26,731 --> 00:54:28,620
I mean I think some of
them look really cool,

1950
00:54:28,650 --> 00:54:31,890
but it's not something that I'm really
into because they seem to me like peacock

1951
00:54:31,891 --> 00:54:32,880
feathers a little bit.

1952
00:54:33,270 --> 00:54:37,050
But what I am a fan of is the
engineering behind those watches.

1953
00:54:37,200 --> 00:54:39,010
I'm a fan of like my watch has done,

1954
00:54:39,011 --> 00:54:39,240
uh,

1955
00:54:39,240 --> 00:54:39,541
it's,

1956
00:54:39,541 --> 00:54:40,050
it's,

1957
00:54:40,050 --> 00:54:42,180
it's just not an expensive watch at all,

1958
00:54:42,300 --> 00:54:42,670
but it,

1959
00:54:42,670 --> 00:54:44,790
it kind of like at
nighttime it kind of glows.

1960
00:54:45,420 --> 00:54:46,400
Like I could see that the,

1961
00:54:46,401 --> 00:54:47,220
the uh,

1962
00:54:47,220 --> 00:54:48,750
the hand very clearly at nighttime,

1963
00:54:49,560 --> 00:54:50,610
it's a fantastic feature.

1964
00:54:50,611 --> 00:54:54,120
It doesn't require a battery to do that
either or it doesn't run on any extra,

1965
00:54:54,420 --> 00:54:54,601
you know,

1966
00:54:54,601 --> 00:54:55,261
sounded like your thing,

1967
00:54:55,261 --> 00:54:56,820
you have to do press a button or anything.

1968
00:54:56,820 --> 00:54:57,653
You can always see it.

1969
00:54:58,290 --> 00:55:00,330
But I'm fascinated by that.

1970
00:55:00,331 --> 00:55:02,580
I'm fascinated by the
engineering involved in it.

1971
00:55:02,581 --> 00:55:04,200
But I think for a lot of guys they were,

1972
00:55:04,320 --> 00:55:05,730
and I'm not criticizing,

1973
00:55:05,930 --> 00:55:07,110
they look cool as fuck,

1974
00:55:07,380 --> 00:55:09,090
but it seems very kind of peacocky,

1975
00:55:09,360 --> 00:55:09,631
you know,

1976
00:55:09,631 --> 00:55:12,030
when dudes have like diamonds all
over their watch and you know,

1977
00:55:12,031 --> 00:55:13,050
diamonds and they thing,

1978
00:55:13,051 --> 00:55:14,400
and my buddy Alex watch this,

1979
00:55:14,401 --> 00:55:14,701
he's just,

1980
00:55:14,701 --> 00:55:17,440
he's showing me a watch $36,000 for,

1981
00:55:17,441 --> 00:55:18,061
it's a watch.

1982
00:55:18,061 --> 00:55:18,840
I was looking at it going,

1983
00:55:18,840 --> 00:55:19,321
Oh man,

1984
00:55:19,321 --> 00:55:19,561
you know,

1985
00:55:19,561 --> 00:55:21,540
and I met a guy that had one in Toronto,

1986
00:55:21,750 --> 00:55:23,940
I think it was like more
than a hundred thousand.

1987
00:55:24,540 --> 00:55:25,980
I'm trying to remember what he will own.

1988
00:55:25,981 --> 00:55:27,510
Like a company that imports them.

1989
00:55:28,020 --> 00:55:28,351
Very,

1990
00:55:28,351 --> 00:55:29,184
very nice guy.

1991
00:55:29,310 --> 00:55:30,300
He loves watches.

1992
00:55:30,330 --> 00:55:30,990
Oh yeah.

1993
00:55:30,990 --> 00:55:33,570
There's people that are
into collecting watches,

1994
00:55:33,870 --> 00:55:34,141
you know,

1995
00:55:34,141 --> 00:55:35,010
and they're very,

1996
00:55:35,011 --> 00:55:37,530
a matter of fact about their watches,

1997
00:55:37,531 --> 00:55:37,651
you know,

1998
00:55:37,651 --> 00:55:37,831
they say,

1999
00:55:37,831 --> 00:55:38,021
oh,

2000
00:55:38,021 --> 00:55:39,450
this is a Hamilton from it.

2001
00:55:39,450 --> 00:55:40,100
You know,

2002
00:55:40,100 --> 00:55:40,890
there's a,

2003
00:55:40,890 --> 00:55:41,580
they have a,

2004
00:55:41,580 --> 00:55:44,610
it's like the cars and
watches are another quality,

2005
00:55:44,611 --> 00:55:44,881
you know,

2006
00:55:44,881 --> 00:55:46,500
like a good watch.

2007
00:55:46,501 --> 00:55:47,510
You like you said,

2008
00:55:47,511 --> 00:55:48,930
it's a Swiss engineer.

2009
00:55:48,931 --> 00:55:49,764
It's a,

2010
00:55:49,830 --> 00:55:51,120
it's a piece of stuff that,

2011
00:55:51,150 --> 00:55:51,431
that,

2012
00:55:51,431 --> 00:55:52,530
that lasts.

2013
00:55:52,870 --> 00:55:55,380
It's not a piece of
junk that's disposable.

2014
00:55:55,410 --> 00:55:56,940
You get a piece of quality,

2015
00:55:57,260 --> 00:55:57,481
you know,

2016
00:55:57,481 --> 00:56:01,620
it's watch and it's got a lot of work put
into it and it's something you'll have

2017
00:56:01,621 --> 00:56:02,454
forever,

2018
00:56:02,610 --> 00:56:03,350
you know?

2019
00:56:03,350 --> 00:56:04,650
And I liked that and stuff.

2020
00:56:05,210 --> 00:56:07,180
That's electronics probably have the um,

2021
00:56:07,230 --> 00:56:11,610
the quickest turnaround as far as
like when they kind of go on you like,

2022
00:56:11,611 --> 00:56:14,070
I've never had a computer
last more than five years,

2023
00:56:14,370 --> 00:56:17,370
but I've had watches that
last like 20 years through.

2024
00:56:17,371 --> 00:56:19,290
I've watched this 20 years old.

2025
00:56:19,291 --> 00:56:19,651
20.

2026
00:56:19,651 --> 00:56:20,160
Yeah.

2027
00:56:20,160 --> 00:56:21,000
It's 20 years old.

2028
00:56:21,120 --> 00:56:23,040
People got their grants
not expensive either.

2029
00:56:23,140 --> 00:56:24,160
Just a regular watch

2030
00:56:24,190 --> 00:56:25,010
and it's,

2031
00:56:25,010 --> 00:56:27,470
it's like when my battery
dies or just buy a new one.

2032
00:56:28,050 --> 00:56:28,270
Yeah.

2033
00:56:28,270 --> 00:56:29,500
I mean you can totally do that.

2034
00:56:29,501 --> 00:56:32,260
You can put another battery in
that watch you divide your watch,

2035
00:56:32,261 --> 00:56:32,590
you said.

2036
00:56:32,590 --> 00:56:32,750
Yeah.

2037
00:56:32,750 --> 00:56:33,940
Every time it the battery dies.

2038
00:56:33,941 --> 00:56:34,220
I'm just like,

2039
00:56:34,220 --> 00:56:37,630
I was going to do watch you is
the one that did that to us.

2040
00:56:37,780 --> 00:56:38,530
They started the,

2041
00:56:38,530 --> 00:56:40,120
the the lighter as you throw it out.

2042
00:56:40,450 --> 00:56:41,370
Then they got the Shaver,

2043
00:56:41,380 --> 00:56:42,213
you throw it out,

2044
00:56:42,400 --> 00:56:44,700
then a w what was your pen?

2045
00:56:45,040 --> 00:56:45,873
You throw it out.

2046
00:56:46,160 --> 00:56:46,701
You remember that?

2047
00:56:46,701 --> 00:56:47,320
It was all big,

2048
00:56:47,320 --> 00:56:51,460
big started with the throwaway stuff
and then now it's like their phone goes

2049
00:56:51,461 --> 00:56:51,731
down,

2050
00:56:51,731 --> 00:56:52,300
you throw it out,

2051
00:56:52,300 --> 00:56:53,140
the TV goes out,

2052
00:56:53,141 --> 00:56:53,974
you throw it out,

2053
00:56:54,010 --> 00:56:54,731
anything goes out,

2054
00:56:54,731 --> 00:56:55,480
you throw it out.

2055
00:56:55,480 --> 00:56:55,840
I mean,

2056
00:56:55,840 --> 00:56:56,110
yeah,

2057
00:56:56,110 --> 00:56:57,550
we should really reevaluate,

2058
00:56:58,030 --> 00:57:00,930
reevaluate the whole
throwing out plastic shit.

2059
00:57:01,150 --> 00:57:05,020
You see all the plastic that's in the
ocean and all these photographs of these

2060
00:57:05,021 --> 00:57:08,760
birds that had been feeding plastics to
their babies and their babies die and

2061
00:57:08,761 --> 00:57:10,900
you see that their bellies
are filled with plastics.

2062
00:57:11,050 --> 00:57:11,311
You know,

2063
00:57:11,311 --> 00:57:12,910
it's fucking shit up lately is these,

2064
00:57:12,980 --> 00:57:13,540
uh,

2065
00:57:13,540 --> 00:57:16,870
those facial cleaners that have the
little beads in them that just these tiny

2066
00:57:16,871 --> 00:57:18,010
little plastic beads,

2067
00:57:18,011 --> 00:57:19,720
I guess they're fucking
up the water and air

2068
00:57:20,100 --> 00:57:20,940
biodegradable.

2069
00:57:20,941 --> 00:57:21,451
Those things.

2070
00:57:21,451 --> 00:57:22,620
There's scrubs and you know what?

2071
00:57:22,621 --> 00:57:23,880
They don't need to use those scrubs.

2072
00:57:23,881 --> 00:57:24,870
You can use seeds.

2073
00:57:25,140 --> 00:57:27,420
There's seeds that you can get like um,

2074
00:57:27,720 --> 00:57:28,321
apricots,

2075
00:57:28,321 --> 00:57:28,951
facial scrub,

2076
00:57:28,951 --> 00:57:32,640
like it's an apricot seed and it's
just as good and it's biodegradable,

2077
00:57:32,830 --> 00:57:36,780
like all these little plastic
things like so unfortunate man,

2078
00:57:36,781 --> 00:57:37,561
but a lot of that,

2079
00:57:37,561 --> 00:57:37,711
oh,

2080
00:57:37,711 --> 00:57:37,911
those,

2081
00:57:37,911 --> 00:57:38,740
those goggles.

2082
00:57:38,740 --> 00:57:40,010
Glasses do not.

2083
00:57:40,011 --> 00:57:42,610
I remember having my calculator watch
and these glasses were really popular.

2084
00:57:42,611 --> 00:57:42,911
They're called,

2085
00:57:42,911 --> 00:57:44,800
they were called something
awesome like douchebag,

2086
00:57:44,830 --> 00:57:45,640
Google glasses,

2087
00:57:45,640 --> 00:57:47,030
but it was a guy wore them

2088
00:57:47,310 --> 00:57:47,840
start,

2089
00:57:47,840 --> 00:57:48,321
start,

2090
00:57:48,321 --> 00:57:48,780
start,

2091
00:57:48,780 --> 00:57:49,680
start date or something.

2092
00:57:51,270 --> 00:57:52,103
Maybe

2093
00:57:52,480 --> 00:57:53,313
they had,

2094
00:57:53,520 --> 00:57:55,330
they had leather on the glasses.

2095
00:57:55,360 --> 00:57:58,460
It's like your car's had brawls on them.

2096
00:57:58,461 --> 00:57:58,821
It's just like,

2097
00:57:58,821 --> 00:58:00,260
we had this weird leathers.

2098
00:58:00,580 --> 00:58:00,981
Oh yeah,

2099
00:58:00,981 --> 00:58:02,780
you remember the Bronx who
we should bring that back.

2100
00:58:03,290 --> 00:58:04,580
I think some people still do it,

2101
00:58:04,581 --> 00:58:04,731
man.

2102
00:58:04,731 --> 00:58:06,110
I saw a guy with a corvette

2103
00:58:06,320 --> 00:58:07,660
day at a bra and a corvette.

2104
00:58:08,440 --> 00:58:08,861
I was like,

2105
00:58:08,861 --> 00:58:09,191
wow,

2106
00:58:09,191 --> 00:58:10,570
you're rocking a brand new corvette.

2107
00:58:10,690 --> 00:58:11,950
Part was an old corvette.

2108
00:58:11,951 --> 00:58:12,850
Wasn't real leather though.

2109
00:58:12,851 --> 00:58:13,684
It was it.

2110
00:58:13,690 --> 00:58:14,111
I don't know.

2111
00:58:14,111 --> 00:58:14,944
I didn't ask you.

2112
00:58:16,600 --> 00:58:17,411
That's a can of worms.

2113
00:58:17,411 --> 00:58:18,430
You don't really want to open up.

2114
00:58:19,020 --> 00:58:19,853
No.

2115
00:58:21,370 --> 00:58:21,821
I know.

2116
00:58:21,821 --> 00:58:25,330
Supra brought on my super
course not that was the shit.

2117
00:58:25,420 --> 00:58:25,661
Yeah,

2118
00:58:25,661 --> 00:58:27,190
I think I had a bra once,

2119
00:58:27,700 --> 00:58:29,260
but I think I got rid
of it pretty quickly.

2120
00:58:29,261 --> 00:58:29,621
I was like,

2121
00:58:29,621 --> 00:58:30,940
what is this stupid fucking thing?

2122
00:58:30,941 --> 00:58:31,774
What am I doing here?

2123
00:58:31,850 --> 00:58:32,421
That's what I'm saying.

2124
00:58:32,421 --> 00:58:35,450
There was a weird time in
the 80s that the leather,

2125
00:58:35,820 --> 00:58:37,610
like there was no reason
to have leather on you.

2126
00:58:37,611 --> 00:58:39,860
Like look the big chunks
of leather on your glasses.

2127
00:58:40,370 --> 00:58:41,360
I guess the idea is

2128
00:58:41,410 --> 00:58:43,300
you want something soft that does.

2129
00:58:43,330 --> 00:58:45,460
That doesn't take light in from the sides,

2130
00:58:45,820 --> 00:58:47,410
but that also fuck up your peripheral.

2131
00:58:47,411 --> 00:58:49,030
May you very susceptible to hooks.

2132
00:58:49,500 --> 00:58:50,333
Yeah.

2133
00:58:50,530 --> 00:58:54,140
They should bring back the plastic
covering for the couches now.

2134
00:58:54,480 --> 00:58:55,313
Oh,

2135
00:58:57,360 --> 00:58:58,440
that was a dream.

2136
00:58:58,441 --> 00:58:58,891
When people,

2137
00:58:58,891 --> 00:59:01,500
you go over their house and it
was covered with clear plastic.

2138
00:59:01,990 --> 00:59:02,461
Sit down.

2139
00:59:02,461 --> 00:59:03,480
It's at grandma's house.

2140
00:59:03,950 --> 00:59:08,130
This is that everyone was wanting to
keep things serving on for so long that

2141
00:59:08,131 --> 00:59:09,690
they never enjoyed them
when they had them.

2142
00:59:09,691 --> 00:59:10,680
Shit wasn't disposable.

2143
00:59:11,430 --> 00:59:12,450
That's amazing.

2144
00:59:12,560 --> 00:59:12,660
Yeah.

2145
00:59:12,660 --> 00:59:14,490
You come in there and
the mom's telling you,

2146
00:59:14,491 --> 00:59:14,641
hey,

2147
00:59:14,641 --> 00:59:15,750
you can't walk in that room.

2148
00:59:15,751 --> 00:59:18,300
It's all this way or that people,

2149
00:59:18,301 --> 00:59:20,790
some people still have towels like that
and that's what's used those towels.

2150
00:59:21,190 --> 00:59:22,550
Get them out of here.

2151
00:59:22,580 --> 00:59:23,413
There's little soaps.

2152
00:59:24,050 --> 00:59:24,530
Oh,

2153
00:59:24,530 --> 00:59:25,420
you didn't use the,

2154
00:59:26,050 --> 00:59:27,000
here's the AML.

2155
00:59:27,010 --> 00:59:30,140
So now that the little
a frog that was there,

2156
00:59:30,460 --> 00:59:31,570
how he could you do that?

2157
00:59:31,571 --> 00:59:32,404
You know,

2158
00:59:32,750 --> 00:59:33,710
you guys are freaks.

2159
00:59:33,740 --> 00:59:33,870
Yeah.

2160
00:59:33,870 --> 00:59:35,280
The toddler was for freak.

2161
00:59:35,281 --> 00:59:36,730
Say up doctor.

2162
00:59:37,090 --> 00:59:37,770
It's a prop.

2163
00:59:37,770 --> 00:59:39,710
You been messing with the
bathroom props in here,

2164
00:59:39,770 --> 00:59:40,100
you know?

2165
00:59:40,100 --> 00:59:40,341
Yeah.

2166
00:59:40,341 --> 00:59:43,690
They're trying to paint some
sort of a crazy environment.

2167
00:59:43,860 --> 00:59:44,693
Oh,

2168
00:59:45,040 --> 00:59:45,873
cleaver.

2169
00:59:46,050 --> 00:59:46,480
Cleaver.

2170
00:59:46,480 --> 00:59:47,260
Uh,

2171
00:59:47,260 --> 00:59:47,810
what's her name?

2172
00:59:47,810 --> 00:59:48,640
Joan.

2173
00:59:48,640 --> 00:59:49,910
What's Ms Cleavers name?

2174
00:59:50,200 --> 00:59:51,033
Um,

2175
00:59:51,740 --> 00:59:52,550
I don't remember.

2176
00:59:52,550 --> 00:59:53,300
It was ward.

2177
00:59:53,300 --> 00:59:54,140
Leave it to ward.

2178
00:59:54,200 --> 00:59:55,160
Ward was the daddy.

2179
00:59:55,170 --> 00:59:55,551
When was it?

2180
00:59:55,551 --> 00:59:56,120
June.

2181
00:59:56,120 --> 00:59:57,410
Was it June cleaver?

2182
00:59:57,660 --> 00:59:58,820
It was mrs cleavers thing.

2183
00:59:58,821 --> 00:59:59,530
It wasn't she the best.

2184
00:59:59,530 --> 01:00:01,490
Barbara Billingsley I think.

2185
01:00:01,540 --> 01:00:02,000
Yeah.

2186
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:02,570
Okay.

2187
01:00:02,570 --> 01:00:03,440
June cleaver.

2188
01:00:03,441 --> 01:00:03,870
I think it was.

2189
01:00:03,870 --> 01:00:04,790
And I think you're right.

2190
01:00:04,970 --> 01:00:05,450
Yeah.

2191
01:00:05,450 --> 01:00:06,500
Remember Eddie Haskell?

2192
01:00:06,680 --> 01:00:07,800
I remember 80 half.

2193
01:00:08,690 --> 01:00:08,901
Yeah,

2194
01:00:08,901 --> 01:00:10,010
it was June cleaver.

2195
01:00:10,100 --> 01:00:11,180
She was wonderful.

2196
01:00:11,181 --> 01:00:12,860
What a crazy fucking show.

2197
01:00:13,130 --> 01:00:16,370
You imagined that there was a show that
they made and it's called leave it to

2198
01:00:16,371 --> 01:00:17,204
beaver.

2199
01:00:17,660 --> 01:00:18,980
And it was an actual show.

2200
01:00:18,981 --> 01:00:20,300
And the kid's name was beaver.

2201
01:00:20,570 --> 01:00:23,660
And at what point in Tom did they
realize that that means pussy?

2202
01:00:23,930 --> 01:00:27,470
Was it like it started in the 1950s right.

2203
01:00:27,830 --> 01:00:29,270
So what,

2204
01:00:29,510 --> 01:00:30,020
you know,

2205
01:00:30,020 --> 01:00:31,790
first appearance was a,

2206
01:00:31,800 --> 01:00:36,530
it was a pilot that they made in
1957 so when did beaver become,

2207
01:00:36,920 --> 01:00:38,180
when did it become a vagina?

2208
01:00:38,390 --> 01:00:39,680
Was that the 70s you think?

2209
01:00:40,340 --> 01:00:41,000
I don't know.

2210
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:45,590
Maybe because everyone thought beaver was
just like a pussy and so they just put

2211
01:00:45,591 --> 01:00:47,960
it together cause he had played
it like a pussy character,

2212
01:00:47,990 --> 01:00:48,210
you know,

2213
01:00:48,210 --> 01:00:49,043
be where was,

2214
01:00:49,340 --> 01:00:50,011
well he wasn't,

2215
01:00:50,011 --> 01:00:50,750
he's getting beat up.

2216
01:00:50,750 --> 01:00:51,860
It wasn't a savage.

2217
01:00:51,890 --> 01:00:52,560
Yeah,

2218
01:00:52,560 --> 01:00:54,360
I thought it was because
of his teeth or something.

2219
01:00:54,361 --> 01:00:55,710
I thought he had like a beaver,

2220
01:00:55,711 --> 01:00:56,700
a facial,

2221
01:00:56,701 --> 01:00:57,600
a look or something.

2222
01:00:57,780 --> 01:00:58,290
Hmm.

2223
01:00:58,290 --> 01:00:58,651
Maybe.

2224
01:00:58,651 --> 01:00:59,131
I don't know.

2225
01:00:59,131 --> 01:00:59,800
Really?

2226
01:00:59,800 --> 01:01:00,390
Yeah.

2227
01:01:00,390 --> 01:01:01,200
This thing they did,

2228
01:01:01,200 --> 01:01:04,170
I really can't get named it
after their teeth or something.

2229
01:01:04,171 --> 01:01:04,650
It'd be her,

2230
01:01:04,650 --> 01:01:05,280
I don't know.

2231
01:01:05,280 --> 01:01:06,210
I don't think so.

2232
01:01:06,480 --> 01:01:07,313
The beaver,

2233
01:01:07,870 --> 01:01:08,703
the beef,

2234
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:10,080
where did that come from?

2235
01:01:10,280 --> 01:01:12,030
I think that was just his nickname.

2236
01:01:13,650 --> 01:01:14,490
How did he get it?

2237
01:01:14,550 --> 01:01:15,181
What did they say?

2238
01:01:15,181 --> 01:01:15,810
Oh yeah,

2239
01:01:15,810 --> 01:01:16,880
you smell bad or what?

2240
01:01:16,881 --> 01:01:17,190
I don't.

2241
01:01:17,190 --> 01:01:18,800
They looked at the time
before the Internet.

2242
01:01:19,050 --> 01:01:22,220
It's like second was a slang
term from the 1910 England.

2243
01:01:22,310 --> 01:01:23,720
Have you ever tried to watch that?

2244
01:01:24,050 --> 01:01:25,580
You ever tried to watch
leave it to beaver?

2245
01:01:25,581 --> 01:01:26,414
I grew up on it.

2246
01:01:26,780 --> 01:01:30,020
We can get back to isolation
tank talking a couple minutes.

2247
01:01:30,021 --> 01:01:31,640
We have plenty of time
release and gentlemen.

2248
01:01:31,850 --> 01:01:33,530
But seeing as how we're
in the flow of this,

2249
01:01:33,531 --> 01:01:37,610
I would like to watch a little quick
leave it to beaver episode just to see how

2250
01:01:37,611 --> 01:01:42,050
ridiculous the world
was in 1957 real quick.

2251
01:01:42,340 --> 01:01:45,190
Even the opening when they have
their house and it's all nice.

2252
01:01:45,430 --> 01:01:46,720
We probably Dennis the menace.

2253
01:01:46,721 --> 01:01:47,830
Remember Mr. Wilson,

2254
01:01:48,430 --> 01:01:49,480
he was over there and he was like,

2255
01:01:49,510 --> 01:01:50,050
oh John,

2256
01:01:50,050 --> 01:01:51,660
you manis or whatever you say.

2257
01:01:51,740 --> 01:01:53,030
She and Mr. Wilson,

2258
01:01:54,410 --> 01:01:55,490
they used to talk to each other.

2259
01:01:55,491 --> 01:01:56,840
It was so alien.

2260
01:01:57,530 --> 01:01:59,750
People hadn't figured out television yet.

2261
01:02:00,320 --> 01:02:01,001
That's would,

2262
01:02:01,001 --> 01:02:03,200
they hadn't figured out how other
people are gonna perceive them.

2263
01:02:03,201 --> 01:02:07,250
There was like a slow change where
people recognize bullshit and they were

2264
01:02:07,251 --> 01:02:08,930
allowed to do less and less of it.

2265
01:02:09,110 --> 01:02:11,180
And if you go back and you
watch father knows best,

2266
01:02:11,181 --> 01:02:11,780
here it is.

2267
01:02:11,780 --> 01:02:12,613
Yes ma'am.

2268
01:02:13,160 --> 01:02:13,591
Oh Babe.

2269
01:02:13,591 --> 01:02:14,570
Or I say your home.

2270
01:02:16,830 --> 01:02:17,391
This is me.

2271
01:02:17,391 --> 01:02:18,224
The tall.

2272
01:02:19,020 --> 01:02:19,920
How was the movie

2273
01:02:21,660 --> 01:02:22,081
like?

2274
01:02:22,081 --> 01:02:22,980
Didn't go to the movie.

2275
01:02:24,840 --> 01:02:25,673
Go to the movie?

2276
01:02:27,080 --> 01:02:27,913
No Sir.

2277
01:02:28,380 --> 01:02:29,550
When I wasn't supposed to.

2278
01:02:32,400 --> 01:02:33,030
Yes sir.

2279
01:02:33,030 --> 01:02:36,630
And I want to race him by school to
guarantee the other seat and I heat it.

2280
01:02:36,631 --> 01:02:39,420
Larry's and I was going to make
believe like I want it today,

2281
01:02:39,930 --> 01:02:40,561
but I couldn't.

2282
01:02:40,561 --> 01:02:41,940
So that's why I'm telling
you what happened.

2283
01:02:43,770 --> 01:02:45,390
When did you decide to tell us about it?

2284
01:02:45,900 --> 01:02:47,670
When I was walking the
bike home from Larry's,

2285
01:02:49,040 --> 01:02:50,370
it's too big for him to ride.

2286
01:02:53,530 --> 01:02:55,380
Glad you decided to tell us the truth.

2287
01:02:56,380 --> 01:02:58,390
Of course you realize
you can't keep a bicycle.

2288
01:02:58,391 --> 01:03:00,100
You one why'd you were being disobedient.

2289
01:03:00,560 --> 01:03:02,440
We're going to have to find
something to do with the bike.

2290
01:03:03,450 --> 01:03:04,283
Dad's,

2291
01:03:04,570 --> 01:03:06,210
that's a kid came clean.

2292
01:03:06,211 --> 01:03:07,430
Let him keep the bike dad,

2293
01:03:07,450 --> 01:03:09,100
the bike kind of fucking lessons.

2294
01:03:09,130 --> 01:03:10,360
You teach it some bullshit.

2295
01:03:10,570 --> 01:03:11,650
He didn't do anything illegal.

2296
01:03:12,420 --> 01:03:12,580
No,

2297
01:03:12,580 --> 01:03:14,650
I came forward and told
him what the story was.

2298
01:03:14,800 --> 01:03:16,510
That's the kind of stuff that the kids,

2299
01:03:16,511 --> 01:03:16,810
now it's,

2300
01:03:16,810 --> 01:03:17,111
Oh,

2301
01:03:17,111 --> 01:03:19,450
I'm afraid to go tell pop because
you've got to take my bike away.

2302
01:03:19,570 --> 01:03:24,570
That some 1957 type of psychology in 2014
I think they would say the best way to

2303
01:03:25,360 --> 01:03:29,260
make this go away or to make it never
happen again is a reward him with the bike

2304
01:03:29,650 --> 01:03:30,580
to reward him and say,

2305
01:03:30,581 --> 01:03:31,151
look you,

2306
01:03:31,151 --> 01:03:34,630
you did a good job by telling me in the
future you would benefit much more from

2307
01:03:34,631 --> 01:03:36,430
just doing what I tell
you in the beginning.

2308
01:03:36,460 --> 01:03:37,121
Don't be lying,

2309
01:03:37,121 --> 01:03:37,954
bitch.

2310
01:03:38,290 --> 01:03:39,010
Go ride your bike.

2311
01:03:39,010 --> 01:03:40,840
And then he thinks Dad's cool,

2312
01:03:41,190 --> 01:03:41,661
not dad.

2313
01:03:41,661 --> 01:03:44,770
Some Dick is going to take
my fucking lawfully one bike.

2314
01:03:45,070 --> 01:03:46,000
He won the bike.

2315
01:03:46,120 --> 01:03:46,601
I mean I,

2316
01:03:46,601 --> 01:03:47,980
that was a bad example.

2317
01:03:47,981 --> 01:03:49,870
Dad thought this was
going to be good stuff.

2318
01:03:49,930 --> 01:03:50,171
Yeah.

2319
01:03:50,171 --> 01:03:50,981
Well that was good.

2320
01:03:50,981 --> 01:03:52,030
That was a bummer man.

2321
01:03:52,031 --> 01:03:53,790
I love her.

2322
01:03:53,800 --> 01:03:54,633
I love the word.

2323
01:03:56,500 --> 01:03:56,831
Yeah,

2324
01:03:56,831 --> 01:03:57,664
it is a bummer.

2325
01:03:58,620 --> 01:03:59,051
Well it's,

2326
01:03:59,051 --> 01:03:59,351
you know,

2327
01:03:59,351 --> 01:04:00,850
it's 1957 logic.

2328
01:04:00,880 --> 01:04:02,500
They just weren't that good at TV yet.

2329
01:04:02,530 --> 01:04:03,640
They didn't understand.

2330
01:04:04,030 --> 01:04:06,280
They didn't understand how it
was coming off to other people.

2331
01:04:06,281 --> 01:04:06,431
Like,

2332
01:04:06,431 --> 01:04:08,380
we just watched that and
it looks so ridiculous,

2333
01:04:08,381 --> 01:04:08,780
right?

2334
01:04:08,780 --> 01:04:08,950
Well,

2335
01:04:08,950 --> 01:04:12,140
it real ad you've got that horse

2336
01:04:14,340 --> 01:04:18,430
which go back to isolation tanks
if Ricky time in television,

2337
01:04:18,460 --> 01:04:19,000
but it's,

2338
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:23,110
it's indicative of this thing that I
think we're experiencing this thing that

2339
01:04:23,111 --> 01:04:26,050
everything is constantly improving
and one of the best ways to see that

2340
01:04:26,051 --> 01:04:26,531
improvement.

2341
01:04:26,531 --> 01:04:27,364
Like you don't,

2342
01:04:27,400 --> 01:04:29,560
if you want it to determine
the age of a tree,

2343
01:04:29,561 --> 01:04:31,660
you would chop the tree down and
he'd look at the rings of the tree.

2344
01:04:32,350 --> 01:04:37,270
I think if you wanted to determine the
progress of our culture in terms of like

2345
01:04:37,271 --> 01:04:38,081
the rings on a tree,

2346
01:04:38,081 --> 01:04:39,490
like in that sort of a way,

2347
01:04:39,550 --> 01:04:40,660
there's no better way to do it.

2348
01:04:40,660 --> 01:04:43,720
Then they go back and look
at the sections of our media,

2349
01:04:44,020 --> 01:04:46,390
go back and look at
like the $6 million man.

2350
01:04:46,620 --> 01:04:46,930
You know,

2351
01:04:46,930 --> 01:04:49,390
go back and look at the fall guy.

2352
01:04:49,391 --> 01:04:52,330
Go back and look at the incredible hulk.

2353
01:04:52,360 --> 01:04:53,650
Go back and look at,

2354
01:04:53,890 --> 01:04:54,430
you know,

2355
01:04:54,430 --> 01:04:55,630
the evolution of TV.

2356
01:04:55,631 --> 01:04:56,050
Yeah.

2357
01:04:56,050 --> 01:04:56,860
Dallas,

2358
01:04:56,860 --> 01:04:57,430
you know,

2359
01:04:57,430 --> 01:04:58,780
watch old television.

2360
01:04:58,810 --> 01:05:03,760
Watch the Dukes of Hazard Watch old
television shows and then go back to leave

2361
01:05:03,761 --> 01:05:04,511
it to beaver,

2362
01:05:04,511 --> 01:05:05,800
go back to this shit,

2363
01:05:05,830 --> 01:05:08,770
get back to this craziness that
we're watching and then realize like,

2364
01:05:08,771 --> 01:05:09,041
whoa,

2365
01:05:09,041 --> 01:05:13,960
there was like this weird
steady progression up to
x files and then you know,

2366
01:05:13,961 --> 01:05:14,741
game of Thrones,

2367
01:05:14,741 --> 01:05:17,230
like the media has improved.

2368
01:05:17,290 --> 01:05:19,810
Like it's a totally different organism.

2369
01:05:19,900 --> 01:05:23,950
The type of shows you see if you watch
a modern day episode of game of Thrones,

2370
01:05:24,170 --> 01:05:29,170
and there's not a film that was made in
the 1960s that could compare to that.

2371
01:05:30,010 --> 01:05:30,843
I don't get,

2372
01:05:30,970 --> 01:05:33,130
I think Stanley Kubrick was a genius.

2373
01:05:33,131 --> 01:05:38,080
I think 2000 West Bass Odyssey was
a marvel of of cinema for the time,

2374
01:05:38,410 --> 01:05:41,470
but it can't fuck with
what they have now on TV.

2375
01:05:41,800 --> 01:05:42,350
Hbo,

2376
01:05:42,350 --> 01:05:46,600
game of Thrones is one of the best
movies of all time and it's like 10 hours

2377
01:05:46,630 --> 01:05:47,530
every season.

2378
01:05:47,740 --> 01:05:48,910
It's madness.

2379
01:05:48,920 --> 01:05:49,691
It's 7 billion.

2380
01:05:49,691 --> 01:05:50,560
It was it 4 million.

2381
01:05:50,561 --> 01:05:51,550
What's the cost on that?

2382
01:05:51,551 --> 01:05:52,220
I don't know.

2383
01:05:52,220 --> 01:05:55,000
It's got to be expensive
as fuck her episode.

2384
01:05:55,030 --> 01:05:56,140
It's perfect.

2385
01:05:56,170 --> 01:05:56,920
It's a fuck.

2386
01:05:56,920 --> 01:05:58,330
It's a perfect show.

2387
01:05:58,720 --> 01:05:59,890
And my point being,

2388
01:05:59,891 --> 01:06:02,620
if you try to compare game of
Thrones to father knows best,

2389
01:06:02,621 --> 01:06:03,580
it's insane.

2390
01:06:03,850 --> 01:06:04,870
It's hard to believe it.

2391
01:06:04,871 --> 01:06:09,250
These are made for the same organism and
you got it occupied the same amount of

2392
01:06:09,251 --> 01:06:10,630
time of a person's interest.

2393
01:06:10,690 --> 01:06:11,523
Yes.

2394
01:06:11,640 --> 01:06:12,341
It's hard.

2395
01:06:12,341 --> 01:06:15,190
It's gotten to hold somebody's
interest and I think it's that.

2396
01:06:15,250 --> 01:06:20,250
I don't think it's a continual improvement
in the understanding of human beings

2397
01:06:20,770 --> 01:06:24,280
and I think it takes something
really intense to rattle us.

2398
01:06:24,280 --> 01:06:26,680
Now it takes like a true detective.

2399
01:06:26,800 --> 01:06:27,870
It takes like it's,

2400
01:06:27,910 --> 01:06:31,690
you can't just have a normal relationship
like bridges of Madison County.

2401
01:06:31,691 --> 01:06:32,590
Get the fuck Outta here.

2402
01:06:32,591 --> 01:06:33,070
Clint,

2403
01:06:33,070 --> 01:06:33,910
what are you doing?

2404
01:06:34,120 --> 01:06:34,631
Like what are you doing?

2405
01:06:34,631 --> 01:06:35,464
You're hanging out with this chick.

2406
01:06:35,630 --> 01:06:37,000
You guys are drama Queens.

2407
01:06:37,090 --> 01:06:38,200
You know you don't have much time left.

2408
01:06:38,201 --> 01:06:38,920
Why you crying?

2409
01:06:38,920 --> 01:06:39,520
Get out of there.

2410
01:06:39,520 --> 01:06:39,701
Go,

2411
01:06:39,701 --> 01:06:39,851
go.

2412
01:06:39,851 --> 01:06:40,360
Have a drink.

2413
01:06:40,360 --> 01:06:41,193
Get out of here.

2414
01:06:41,200 --> 01:06:42,790
Stop nothing.

2415
01:06:43,210 --> 01:06:45,040
Meanwhile you watch game of Thrones.

2416
01:06:45,250 --> 01:06:46,690
There's fucking dragons.

2417
01:06:46,840 --> 01:06:47,560
Okay?

2418
01:06:47,560 --> 01:06:49,240
There's this white walkers.

2419
01:06:49,330 --> 01:06:52,500
People were sword fighting in the middle
of the night of was white walkers.

2420
01:06:52,530 --> 01:06:52,690
Oh,

2421
01:06:52,690 --> 01:06:54,870
it's the fucking tags.

2422
01:06:55,240 --> 01:06:57,570
How about the giants are great.

2423
01:06:57,610 --> 01:06:58,660
It's a madness show.

2424
01:06:58,661 --> 01:07:00,770
I love the crazy shit is
happening and crazy stuff.

2425
01:07:00,790 --> 01:07:05,790
What the humans do to each other is
so shocking and if you tried to watch,

2426
01:07:06,790 --> 01:07:08,160
if you tried to watch um,

2427
01:07:08,400 --> 01:07:10,150
a magnum Pi after that,

2428
01:07:10,151 --> 01:07:10,511
you'd be like,

2429
01:07:10,511 --> 01:07:11,344
come on man,

2430
01:07:11,730 --> 01:07:13,630
it's the world's changed.

2431
01:07:13,780 --> 01:07:17,980
We've gotten a much deeper understanding
of what really freaks people out and we

2432
01:07:17,981 --> 01:07:21,460
require that to get freaked
out or today's trolls.

2433
01:07:21,461 --> 01:07:26,200
Today's Youtube trolls could start wars
in the 1940s if he could send those guys

2434
01:07:26,201 --> 01:07:26,861
back at time,

2435
01:07:26,861 --> 01:07:28,600
like the really sophisticated trolls,

2436
01:07:28,870 --> 01:07:29,681
the ones we read,

2437
01:07:29,681 --> 01:07:33,070
their Twitter account and you can
barely even tell if they're trolling.

2438
01:07:33,310 --> 01:07:34,061
They're just so,

2439
01:07:34,061 --> 01:07:36,880
and then you watch like some of the
arguments that get into the skies and

2440
01:07:36,881 --> 01:07:37,360
artists.

2441
01:07:37,360 --> 01:07:38,230
I don't know what that is.

2442
01:07:38,290 --> 01:07:40,350
Trolling is save.

2443
01:07:40,360 --> 01:07:41,500
Somebody wanted to reach out to,

2444
01:07:41,540 --> 01:07:43,210
I should probably not tell
you the trolls get mad.

2445
01:07:43,240 --> 01:07:43,901
Like what the fuck?

2446
01:07:43,901 --> 01:07:44,734
We got a fresh one.

2447
01:07:45,060 --> 01:07:46,380
We've got to lie on the bed.

2448
01:07:46,490 --> 01:07:47,630
They're not going to call me out.

2449
01:07:48,180 --> 01:07:49,480
It's not a call you out thing.

2450
01:07:49,510 --> 01:07:52,210
They would contact you
in some sort of a way.

2451
01:07:52,240 --> 01:07:57,240
Either insulting you and try and get you
to respond to them or mockingly in love

2452
01:07:57,911 --> 01:08:01,090
with you to try to get you to
respond to them and then turn on you.

2453
01:08:01,340 --> 01:08:02,050
Uh,

2454
01:08:02,050 --> 01:08:07,050
they would try to pretend that they were
outraged about certain specific issues

2455
01:08:07,331 --> 01:08:08,620
just to get a rise out of you.

2456
01:08:09,070 --> 01:08:12,280
Try to engage you in just an as a game.

2457
01:08:12,580 --> 01:08:13,750
There's people now that have,

2458
01:08:13,780 --> 01:08:14,830
there's a group of folks,

2459
01:08:15,400 --> 01:08:16,130
that kind of stuff.

2460
01:08:16,130 --> 01:08:16,963
It's a sport.

2461
01:08:16,970 --> 01:08:17,803
It's a sport.

2462
01:08:17,870 --> 01:08:19,070
It is kind of a sport,

2463
01:08:19,250 --> 01:08:19,491
you know,

2464
01:08:19,491 --> 01:08:21,800
if you can get a good one on the line.

2465
01:08:21,890 --> 01:08:22,723
Yeah know,

2466
01:08:22,910 --> 01:08:24,150
oh my,

2467
01:08:24,260 --> 01:08:25,790
I haven't gotten on the line before.

2468
01:08:26,090 --> 01:08:26,923
It's hilarious.

2469
01:08:27,050 --> 01:08:27,650
Got You.

2470
01:08:27,650 --> 01:08:28,101
Yeah.

2471
01:08:28,101 --> 01:08:30,950
I get rid of it and gotten in arguments
with people before and you realize like,

2472
01:08:30,951 --> 01:08:31,430
what am I,

2473
01:08:31,430 --> 01:08:33,230
I don't even know you and you.

2474
01:08:33,290 --> 01:08:37,550
It takes a lot of time to realize that
because the Internet is a new thing in

2475
01:08:37,551 --> 01:08:41,840
the interacting with people on the
Internet is what's been around 10 years.

2476
01:08:41,960 --> 01:08:44,630
If I study your buttons to
say something like that,

2477
01:08:44,631 --> 01:08:48,500
you see what he does when you say that
the longest people were interacting on

2478
01:08:48,501 --> 01:08:49,460
the Internet like this,

2479
01:08:49,580 --> 01:08:51,470
like in this sort of like instantaneous,

2480
01:08:51,471 --> 01:08:53,570
like Twitter type comments
or youtube type comments.

2481
01:08:53,930 --> 01:08:54,681
That's never,

2482
01:08:54,681 --> 01:08:56,570
it hasn't been more than a decade.

2483
01:08:56,690 --> 01:08:57,710
This is a new thing.

2484
01:08:58,160 --> 01:08:59,120
It was a new thing for people.

2485
01:08:59,121 --> 01:09:00,530
So people who were,

2486
01:09:00,560 --> 01:09:01,010
uh,

2487
01:09:01,010 --> 01:09:02,690
who liked to get a rise out of people.

2488
01:09:02,780 --> 01:09:03,770
If you can't do it at work,

2489
01:09:03,771 --> 01:09:08,210
especially if you're stuck at a job
that sucks and you have no means of

2490
01:09:08,211 --> 01:09:10,390
expression of the evil inside you.

2491
01:09:11,410 --> 01:09:15,260
That's why I wonder why does it people
watch these videos and then say that like

2492
01:09:15,261 --> 01:09:16,094
with Hamilton,

2493
01:09:16,190 --> 01:09:18,470
they watched the video
there and then their comics.

2494
01:09:18,471 --> 01:09:19,470
I don't Hamilton Morris,

2495
01:09:20,430 --> 01:09:21,201
Hamilton Morris.

2496
01:09:21,201 --> 01:09:22,370
We owe him an apology.

2497
01:09:22,400 --> 01:09:25,520
I mean when that podcast was made,

2498
01:09:25,521 --> 01:09:27,410
we both got way too.

2499
01:09:27,411 --> 01:09:30,230
Hi Brian and I got him.

2500
01:09:30,231 --> 01:09:33,310
We took him to the center
of the earth this morning.

2501
01:09:33,890 --> 01:09:35,150
We took him to more door.

2502
01:09:35,480 --> 01:09:40,460
We have this weed that was grown on Pluto
and came over here in a time capsule.

2503
01:09:40,670 --> 01:09:42,650
I don't know where we got that shit from.

2504
01:09:43,310 --> 01:09:43,610
Who?

2505
01:09:43,610 --> 01:09:44,450
Who's was that?

2506
01:09:44,480 --> 01:09:45,290
I didn't remember.

2507
01:09:45,290 --> 01:09:45,830
I didn't even,

2508
01:09:45,830 --> 01:09:46,790
well you didn't have to twist.

2509
01:09:46,810 --> 01:09:51,590
This is where there with Hamilton
Morris who is the psychedelic.

2510
01:09:51,910 --> 01:09:52,670
Sure.

2511
01:09:52,670 --> 01:09:57,260
So we went to the bottom of the swimming
pool and fucking set up a picnic table.

2512
01:09:57,840 --> 01:09:59,060
I mean we went deep.

2513
01:09:59,270 --> 01:10:00,320
It was rough man.

2514
01:10:00,321 --> 01:10:02,030
I don't know what the
fuck we're talking about.

2515
01:10:02,180 --> 01:10:03,980
Half the time we were in a conversation,

2516
01:10:04,100 --> 01:10:05,060
we were like seven,

2517
01:10:05,070 --> 01:10:09,140
eight hits and have some insane sativa
and there was no way we should have been

2518
01:10:09,141 --> 01:10:11,180
having a conversation in a podcast.

2519
01:10:11,210 --> 01:10:12,043
No Way.

2520
01:10:12,230 --> 01:10:12,770
We were just,

2521
01:10:12,770 --> 01:10:13,441
we were wage.

2522
01:10:13,441 --> 01:10:14,300
You barbecued.

2523
01:10:14,880 --> 01:10:15,100
Uh,

2524
01:10:15,100 --> 01:10:16,100
I turned out okay.

2525
01:10:16,130 --> 01:10:16,963
It was not bad.

2526
01:10:17,030 --> 01:10:19,850
We interact with him
in the tank was better,

2527
01:10:20,480 --> 01:10:21,051
the whole thing,

2528
01:10:21,051 --> 01:10:21,884
you know that.

2529
01:10:21,920 --> 01:10:23,300
But the comments were evil.

2530
01:10:23,360 --> 01:10:23,631
Well,

2531
01:10:23,631 --> 01:10:24,140
you know,

2532
01:10:24,140 --> 01:10:26,150
even on some of these other
ones you read and they say,

2533
01:10:26,180 --> 01:10:26,421
Oh,

2534
01:10:26,421 --> 01:10:26,751
you know,

2535
01:10:26,751 --> 01:10:28,250
this or that or this guy,

2536
01:10:28,280 --> 01:10:29,870
they're trying to make an assumption,

2537
01:10:29,900 --> 01:10:30,130
you know,

2538
01:10:30,130 --> 01:10:32,690
an evaluation about somebody
they don't know anything about.

2539
01:10:33,020 --> 01:10:37,580
And the fact that you just spent your
time over viewing what it is they just did

2540
01:10:37,850 --> 01:10:40,310
and now you're going to be
a mean spirited about it.

2541
01:10:40,330 --> 01:10:40,820
Right.

2542
01:10:40,820 --> 01:10:41,870
Why don't you just don't do it.

2543
01:10:41,871 --> 01:10:42,704
Just don't look just,

2544
01:10:43,150 --> 01:10:43,461
you know,

2545
01:10:43,461 --> 01:10:45,110
but you find that I didn't know,

2546
01:10:45,111 --> 01:10:47,360
these are these kinds of cats
that that's what they're up to,

2547
01:10:47,361 --> 01:10:51,300
these trolls that they
enjoy and make an uh,

2548
01:10:51,410 --> 01:10:52,130
you know,

2549
01:10:52,130 --> 01:10:53,600
getting a rise out of people,

2550
01:10:53,601 --> 01:10:56,750
which is a bummer when you don't have
a lot of time to get her because you're

2551
01:10:56,751 --> 01:10:59,210
trying to get through life
without as little as these,

2552
01:10:59,290 --> 01:11:00,080
you know,

2553
01:11:00,080 --> 01:11:03,950
infractions as possible so you
could keep your mind in a positive,

2554
01:11:04,290 --> 01:11:04,760
you know,

2555
01:11:04,760 --> 01:11:08,450
format and then somebody saying something
mean or ugly about you and you're

2556
01:11:08,451 --> 01:11:09,284
reading it and you're going,

2557
01:11:09,320 --> 01:11:10,041
Oh shit man,

2558
01:11:10,041 --> 01:11:11,750
I wish that that didn't get said about me.

2559
01:11:11,751 --> 01:11:12,584
You know,

2560
01:11:13,080 --> 01:11:14,250
I think there's a benefit

2561
01:11:14,250 --> 01:11:15,083
to it though.

2562
01:11:15,200 --> 01:11:18,120
I think there's a benefit to interacting
with negative people is that you

2563
01:11:18,121 --> 01:11:20,250
understand that there are
negative people out there.

2564
01:11:20,280 --> 01:11:20,761
Cause if you,

2565
01:11:20,761 --> 01:11:22,680
if you don't interact with
them on a regular basis,

2566
01:11:22,681 --> 01:11:25,740
I don't think you'll appreciate
the positive people as much.

2567
01:11:26,180 --> 01:11:28,770
And I think that's just the
weird aspect of human beings.

2568
01:11:28,771 --> 01:11:30,570
We get accustomed to whatever,

2569
01:11:30,840 --> 01:11:31,651
we get accustomed to,

2570
01:11:31,651 --> 01:11:32,431
all sorts of things.

2571
01:11:32,431 --> 01:11:33,630
It seems unacceptable.

2572
01:11:33,810 --> 01:11:36,260
Like if you look at the things
and customs that people,

2573
01:11:36,261 --> 01:11:36,510
uh,

2574
01:11:36,510 --> 01:11:37,800
carry on in other countries,

2575
01:11:37,801 --> 01:11:41,790
there's certain rites of passage for
manhood that if you tried to implement

2576
01:11:41,791 --> 01:11:42,780
today in the United States,

2577
01:11:43,080 --> 01:11:46,680
like the weird shit that they do in Africa
where it circumcising each other with

2578
01:11:46,681 --> 01:11:51,681
sharp sticks and they have to go
crawl through thorn bushes naked,

2579
01:11:51,871 --> 01:11:55,260
like a bunch of crazy shit
they make these guys do.

2580
01:11:55,530 --> 01:11:57,960
And if you try to implement
that stuff in America today,

2581
01:11:57,961 --> 01:11:58,710
we would laugh at you.

2582
01:11:58,710 --> 01:12:00,960
But to them like this
is how they've done it.

2583
01:12:00,990 --> 01:12:02,700
This is how they've
done it for a long time.

2584
01:12:03,120 --> 01:12:05,160
And people get used to
all sorts of weird shit.

2585
01:12:05,460 --> 01:12:06,300
So they,

2586
01:12:06,390 --> 01:12:09,990
I think a lot of people have gotten
used to something that just raw,

2587
01:12:10,040 --> 01:12:14,460
it rages against their sensibilities
and it rages against their body,

2588
01:12:14,670 --> 01:12:17,610
rages against their sensibilities because
they've somehow or another committed

2589
01:12:17,611 --> 01:12:22,020
themselves to a safe job
that is not inspiring.

2590
01:12:22,260 --> 01:12:25,950
And they think that maybe if they just
waited a little while or thought about it

2591
01:12:25,951 --> 01:12:26,191
better,

2592
01:12:26,191 --> 01:12:29,100
they could have eventually figured out
how to do what they actually want to do.

2593
01:12:29,670 --> 01:12:31,400
And when you're wanting to someone who,

2594
01:12:31,430 --> 01:12:32,580
who has done that,

2595
01:12:32,581 --> 01:12:35,880
then you see the benefit of it
and it fucks with people's heads,

2596
01:12:35,910 --> 01:12:36,211
you know?

2597
01:12:36,211 --> 01:12:39,360
And I think there's a lot of people
that live a life of regret and bitter.

2598
01:12:39,390 --> 01:12:40,470
Super unfortunate.

2599
01:12:41,010 --> 01:12:41,520
You know?

2600
01:12:41,520 --> 01:12:42,353
And I think

2601
01:12:43,830 --> 01:12:46,080
the way our society is
structured currently,

2602
01:12:46,110 --> 01:12:46,943
I don't,

2603
01:12:47,580 --> 01:12:49,950
I don't see that changing anytime soon.

2604
01:12:50,490 --> 01:12:55,170
It just seems like so many people are
rushing out to enter into the workforce

2605
01:12:55,200 --> 01:12:57,600
because the economy is not so good.

2606
01:12:57,601 --> 01:13:01,350
So everybody's scrapping for jobs and
they're willing to take jobs they might

2607
01:13:01,351 --> 01:13:06,030
not have ordinary ordinarily taken
because they want the security of it.

2608
01:13:06,210 --> 01:13:08,220
It's a very trying time
for a lot of people,

2609
01:13:08,640 --> 01:13:12,000
but if you could figure out a
way to separate on your own,

2610
01:13:12,750 --> 01:13:13,111
you know,

2611
01:13:13,111 --> 01:13:16,950
selling coffee mugs are
fucking figuring something out,

2612
01:13:17,220 --> 01:13:17,541
damn,

2613
01:13:17,541 --> 01:13:18,750
you'll be so much better off.

2614
01:13:19,750 --> 01:13:23,720
Well it allows you to be more independent
and your ability to provide for

2615
01:13:23,721 --> 01:13:24,350
yourself.

2616
01:13:24,350 --> 01:13:26,120
If you could figure out
something you can do.

2617
01:13:26,450 --> 01:13:29,750
What I find to be a little
bit discouraging is the uh,

2618
01:13:30,050 --> 01:13:33,950
the lack of a interest in
manufacturing products.

2619
01:13:33,980 --> 01:13:34,530
And then,

2620
01:13:34,530 --> 01:13:35,363
um,

2621
01:13:35,640 --> 01:13:36,240
see,

2622
01:13:36,240 --> 01:13:37,550
like this country used to be,

2623
01:13:37,551 --> 01:13:37,880
like I say,

2624
01:13:37,880 --> 01:13:41,390
really have a lot of
pride and craftsmanship.

2625
01:13:41,391 --> 01:13:41,511
See,

2626
01:13:41,511 --> 01:13:43,400
we still have a talent pool here.

2627
01:13:43,730 --> 01:13:45,290
We have a lot of creative people.

2628
01:13:45,620 --> 01:13:46,850
We have a lot of uh,

2629
01:13:46,880 --> 01:13:47,540
you know,

2630
01:13:47,540 --> 01:13:52,280
intelligent people and we need to pull
these people together and get back into

2631
01:13:52,281 --> 01:13:54,020
manufacturing our own products here.

2632
01:13:54,590 --> 01:13:55,423
Yeah,

2633
01:13:55,940 --> 01:13:58,580
that's what I believe would
be a good thing to get kids.

2634
01:13:59,000 --> 01:14:00,470
They took auto shop out of the school,

2635
01:14:00,471 --> 01:14:00,951
I think.

2636
01:14:00,951 --> 01:14:03,630
I don't think that they do the
welding anymore in school wood shop.

2637
01:14:03,890 --> 01:14:05,210
I don't know what they do in school.

2638
01:14:05,270 --> 01:14:06,600
A lot of schools don't a lot school

2639
01:14:06,900 --> 01:14:07,520
have that anymore.

2640
01:14:07,520 --> 01:14:08,960
There's a lot of liability issues.

2641
01:14:08,990 --> 01:14:10,400
Those things to people.

2642
01:14:11,140 --> 01:14:12,430
I don't think it's very common.

2643
01:14:12,930 --> 01:14:16,470
It's not something they teach
kids how to use a hammer.

2644
01:14:16,920 --> 01:14:17,220
You know,

2645
01:14:17,220 --> 01:14:18,090
you go to school,

2646
01:14:18,390 --> 01:14:20,430
you should teach a kid how
to work a hammer or a saw.

2647
01:14:20,510 --> 01:14:20,601
Well,

2648
01:14:20,601 --> 01:14:21,270
I think you know,

2649
01:14:21,270 --> 01:14:25,160
the ebb and flow that we were talking
about with technology and that people,

2650
01:14:25,161 --> 01:14:25,490
some,

2651
01:14:25,490 --> 01:14:29,000
some folks kind of like bouncing back
the other way and looking towards

2652
01:14:29,001 --> 01:14:31,340
mechanical things and being in
love with mechanical things.

2653
01:14:31,520 --> 01:14:34,910
I think that also is going to be said
about working for big companies that I

2654
01:14:34,911 --> 01:14:38,090
think that a lot of these people are
going to get this feeling of like,

2655
01:14:38,091 --> 01:14:38,391
man,

2656
01:14:38,391 --> 01:14:40,550
I'm just lost in this sea of people.

2657
01:14:40,760 --> 01:14:44,060
Whereas I can make kitchen knives.

2658
01:14:44,061 --> 01:14:47,090
I can make handmade kitchen knives
in my garage over the weekend,

2659
01:14:47,510 --> 01:14:48,680
start selling them,

2660
01:14:48,770 --> 01:14:51,500
and then one day or another
eventually break through.

2661
01:14:51,501 --> 01:14:54,440
I've got a website from Squarespace
and I put together this fucking knife

2662
01:14:54,441 --> 01:14:57,350
collection and now I'm selling
them online and now I'm independent

2663
01:14:57,870 --> 01:14:59,840
because using a Monte TV chef,

2664
01:15:00,050 --> 01:15:01,760
Luigi is endorsed my,

2665
01:15:01,761 --> 01:15:02,594
uh,

2666
01:15:02,890 --> 01:15:05,260
that shit you want some
handmade like does a company.

2667
01:15:05,261 --> 01:15:05,850
Um,

2668
01:15:05,850 --> 01:15:08,620
there's a couple of companies
that have sent me a crest trail,

2669
01:15:08,621 --> 01:15:09,310
knives,

2670
01:15:09,310 --> 01:15:11,500
kestrel knives and a vehement knives.

2671
01:15:11,501 --> 01:15:13,300
And there were companies that
did the exact same thing.

2672
01:15:13,540 --> 01:15:16,830
They just started making knives and start
selling them that were in tonight's,

2673
01:15:16,840 --> 01:15:20,070
they loved the beauty of the
construction of the NYSE VM at knife.

2674
01:15:20,110 --> 01:15:21,340
They made me this fucking big,

2675
01:15:21,341 --> 01:15:21,821
crazy,

2676
01:15:21,821 --> 01:15:22,601
cool thing.

2677
01:15:22,601 --> 01:15:25,550
It's like all the handles all handmade.

2678
01:15:25,551 --> 01:15:26,330
And when you,

2679
01:15:26,330 --> 01:15:26,860
when you know,

2680
01:15:26,860 --> 01:15:29,140
you see that someone can make a
living doing that and like can,

2681
01:15:29,141 --> 01:15:30,880
when you're chopping onions
with something like that,

2682
01:15:30,900 --> 01:15:34,600
are you doing something in the kitchen
or you're using it for camping or hunting

2683
01:15:34,601 --> 01:15:35,261
or something like that?

2684
01:15:35,261 --> 01:15:38,170
It's like you're feeling like you have
a piece of craftsmanship with you.

2685
01:15:38,290 --> 01:15:39,123
Awesome.

2686
01:15:39,260 --> 01:15:40,093
I love that.

2687
01:15:40,260 --> 01:15:40,560
Right.

2688
01:15:40,560 --> 01:15:41,030
What does that,

2689
01:15:41,030 --> 01:15:42,970
there's a connection to
the person who made it,

2690
01:15:42,971 --> 01:15:43,370
right?

2691
01:15:43,370 --> 01:15:43,570
Yeah.

2692
01:15:43,570 --> 01:15:44,920
Like a more obvious connection.

2693
01:15:45,130 --> 01:15:45,963
Absolutely.

2694
01:15:46,030 --> 01:15:47,040
Like if you had a handmade,

2695
01:15:47,041 --> 01:15:48,390
like my friend Ari went to China,

2696
01:15:48,400 --> 01:15:49,570
get a handmade suit,

2697
01:15:50,530 --> 01:15:51,360
fucking handmade.

2698
01:15:51,360 --> 01:15:52,450
[inaudible] perfect.

2699
01:15:52,510 --> 01:15:53,343
Yeah.

2700
01:15:53,370 --> 01:15:54,860
That's me and a guy mind,

2701
01:15:54,880 --> 01:15:55,600
you know,

2702
01:15:55,600 --> 01:15:55,871
that's,

2703
01:15:55,871 --> 01:15:58,780
there's something extra jazzy
about the fact that you know,

2704
01:15:58,781 --> 01:15:59,800
that a guy made this for you.

2705
01:15:59,801 --> 01:16:00,610
Like that feels good.

2706
01:16:00,610 --> 01:16:01,120
That's right.

2707
01:16:01,120 --> 01:16:01,781
He took your,

2708
01:16:01,781 --> 01:16:03,490
your proportions into consideration.

2709
01:16:03,580 --> 01:16:03,860
Yeah.

2710
01:16:03,860 --> 01:16:05,950
Cause you're six feet tall
doesn't mean that your,

2711
01:16:05,951 --> 01:16:09,210
your knees are bending here or
your stride is this or that.

2712
01:16:09,330 --> 01:16:09,851
And is,

2713
01:16:09,851 --> 01:16:10,810
he's an artisan.

2714
01:16:11,200 --> 01:16:11,411
I mean,

2715
01:16:11,411 --> 01:16:13,330
he's an artist and he
creates a beautiful suit.

2716
01:16:13,331 --> 01:16:13,980
It's a,

2717
01:16:13,980 --> 01:16:15,210
it's a pleasure out of that.

2718
01:16:15,410 --> 01:16:16,520
So that's back to that,

2719
01:16:16,521 --> 01:16:16,791
that,

2720
01:16:16,791 --> 01:16:18,300
that feeling of accomplishment.

2721
01:16:18,330 --> 01:16:20,700
W you could feel like by making stuff.

2722
01:16:20,930 --> 01:16:21,041
Oh,

2723
01:16:21,041 --> 01:16:21,780
look at,

2724
01:16:21,780 --> 01:16:22,740
I feel good about that.

2725
01:16:22,780 --> 01:16:24,000
Like what we do with the chambers,

2726
01:16:24,050 --> 01:16:24,630
we,

2727
01:16:24,630 --> 01:16:25,350
uh,

2728
01:16:25,350 --> 01:16:30,090
we really put a lot of effort into the
manufacturing of them and the products

2729
01:16:30,091 --> 01:16:30,631
that we use,

2730
01:16:30,631 --> 01:16:30,870
the,

2731
01:16:30,870 --> 01:16:31,703
the parts,

2732
01:16:31,890 --> 01:16:32,723
all of them.

2733
01:16:32,940 --> 01:16:34,410
Not that there's anything wrong with,

2734
01:16:34,440 --> 01:16:34,800
uh,

2735
01:16:34,800 --> 01:16:35,221
you know,

2736
01:16:35,221 --> 01:16:37,380
whatever we use no cheap parts.

2737
01:16:37,430 --> 01:16:39,210
There was nothing made in China.

2738
01:16:39,211 --> 01:16:40,980
Not that there's anything
wrong with made in China,

2739
01:16:40,981 --> 01:16:44,180
but we don't buy anything that's
used in China for our stuff at all.

2740
01:16:44,181 --> 01:16:47,610
So I'll either made here or north
in North America somewhere to,

2741
01:16:47,660 --> 01:16:47,911
to,

2742
01:16:47,911 --> 01:16:48,390
uh,

2743
01:16:48,390 --> 01:16:50,790
we have a few European parts
from German and Switzerland,

2744
01:16:50,791 --> 01:16:52,590
but the rest of it's all a,

2745
01:16:52,890 --> 01:16:55,530
it made here in America
because of the quality.

2746
01:16:55,670 --> 01:16:58,080
We insist upon getting the best pieces.

2747
01:16:58,390 --> 01:16:59,640
And that was the guy you spoke about,

2748
01:16:59,641 --> 01:17:00,001
Lilly,

2749
01:17:00,001 --> 01:17:02,130
John Lilly didn't invented
these chambers in the beginning.

2750
01:17:02,490 --> 01:17:03,180
He,

2751
01:17:03,180 --> 01:17:05,800
his docker 10 was a doctorate
in or whatever it is.

2752
01:17:05,801 --> 01:17:05,971
His,

2753
01:17:05,971 --> 01:17:06,660
uh,

2754
01:17:06,660 --> 01:17:07,493
his,

2755
01:17:07,500 --> 01:17:12,500
his perspective was that it was always
better to buy or to you implement or use

2756
01:17:13,101 --> 01:17:13,340
it,

2757
01:17:13,340 --> 01:17:14,840
the better quality,

2758
01:17:15,330 --> 01:17:16,163
uh,

2759
01:17:16,280 --> 01:17:21,280
piece of equipment then to create this
what it is that it is and that is,

2760
01:17:21,710 --> 01:17:22,011
you know,

2761
01:17:22,011 --> 01:17:25,640
so I agree with that so
much that the better it is,

2762
01:17:25,641 --> 01:17:27,200
the better it is just saying,

2763
01:17:27,230 --> 01:17:27,381
oh,

2764
01:17:27,381 --> 01:17:28,880
you can get away with it all.

2765
01:17:28,881 --> 01:17:29,750
We could do it this way.

2766
01:17:29,751 --> 01:17:30,740
It's cheaper.

2767
01:17:31,010 --> 01:17:31,430
Or,

2768
01:17:31,430 --> 01:17:32,270
you know,

2769
01:17:32,271 --> 01:17:33,050
a sec,

2770
01:17:33,050 --> 01:17:33,411
you know,

2771
01:17:33,411 --> 01:17:34,244
it's,

2772
01:17:34,310 --> 01:17:34,971
I find it,

2773
01:17:34,971 --> 01:17:37,490
if you could figure out
the best way to do things,

2774
01:17:37,491 --> 01:17:38,330
that's the way to do it.

2775
01:17:38,331 --> 01:17:39,164
First Class,

2776
01:17:39,350 --> 01:17:40,910
you've got first class or no class.

2777
01:17:40,911 --> 01:17:41,480
You know what I mean?

2778
01:17:41,480 --> 01:17:42,440
These people come up with this thing.

2779
01:17:42,800 --> 01:17:43,071
Oh,

2780
01:17:43,071 --> 01:17:43,570
it's,

2781
01:17:43,570 --> 01:17:45,440
this is what I used to
mix sound right on the,

2782
01:17:45,441 --> 01:17:47,450
I do monitors mixed us from the stage.

2783
01:17:47,480 --> 01:17:49,160
I don't think Susan was saying,

2784
01:17:49,290 --> 01:17:49,520
he said,

2785
01:17:49,520 --> 01:17:49,790
hell,

2786
01:17:49,790 --> 01:17:50,151
how has it,

2787
01:17:50,151 --> 01:17:50,331
is it,

2788
01:17:50,331 --> 01:17:50,481
oh,

2789
01:17:50,481 --> 01:17:51,021
it's okay.

2790
01:17:51,021 --> 01:17:51,560
I'm pretty good.

2791
01:17:51,560 --> 01:17:51,850
I said,

2792
01:17:51,850 --> 01:17:52,081
no,

2793
01:17:52,081 --> 01:17:52,611
I'm not in that.

2794
01:17:52,611 --> 01:17:53,660
We don't do pretty good.

2795
01:17:53,661 --> 01:17:54,710
We don't do okay.

2796
01:17:54,890 --> 01:17:55,970
We get to just the way you want.

2797
01:17:55,971 --> 01:17:57,430
I'm going to have that
in a second for you.

2798
01:17:57,431 --> 01:18:01,370
You just communicate with me and we'll
have a just exactly the way you want

2799
01:18:01,371 --> 01:18:01,640
that.

2800
01:18:01,640 --> 01:18:02,400
Not a problem.

2801
01:18:02,400 --> 01:18:02,731
Right.

2802
01:18:02,731 --> 01:18:04,260
Well that's like many aspects of life.

2803
01:18:04,261 --> 01:18:07,080
There's some people that are
happily halfass and things.

2804
01:18:07,140 --> 01:18:07,411
Yeah.

2805
01:18:07,411 --> 01:18:09,310
Just happily getting
to the end of the day.

2806
01:18:09,830 --> 01:18:11,400
Slunk over,

2807
01:18:11,840 --> 01:18:12,151
you know,

2808
01:18:12,151 --> 01:18:14,340
slumped over and just tired.

2809
01:18:14,341 --> 01:18:15,010
And,

2810
01:18:15,010 --> 01:18:18,060
and then there's other folks that
like you who were fucking crazy,

2811
01:18:18,210 --> 01:18:18,451
who,

2812
01:18:18,451 --> 01:18:19,080
uh,

2813
01:18:19,080 --> 01:18:24,080
figure out a way to invest in incredible
amount of time to try to renovate and

2814
01:18:24,780 --> 01:18:26,670
reinvigorate this,

2815
01:18:26,671 --> 01:18:27,000
uh,

2816
01:18:27,000 --> 01:18:28,890
this business that had kind
of been forgotten about.

2817
01:18:28,891 --> 01:18:29,280
I mean,

2818
01:18:29,280 --> 01:18:33,270
when you came along there was like
somebody tanks and then there was a couple

2819
01:18:33,271 --> 01:18:35,190
other ones that you could
kind of find online,

2820
01:18:35,460 --> 01:18:35,731
you know,

2821
01:18:35,731 --> 01:18:37,080
that were made in Europe,

2822
01:18:37,190 --> 01:18:38,023
Europe,

2823
01:18:38,220 --> 01:18:38,850
it hadn't,

2824
01:18:38,850 --> 01:18:40,740
it had a little bit more
popularity in Europe

2825
01:18:41,800 --> 01:18:42,880
Pathfinder.

2826
01:18:43,270 --> 01:18:43,991
And then they had,

2827
01:18:43,991 --> 01:18:44,824
uh,

2828
01:18:45,100 --> 01:18:45,690
let's see,

2829
01:18:45,690 --> 01:18:48,310
oasis has been around
since from the beginning.

2830
01:18:48,350 --> 01:18:50,930
Why was it more popular in
Europe than it wasn't American?

2831
01:18:51,100 --> 01:18:51,540
You know,

2832
01:18:51,540 --> 01:18:52,373
uh,

2833
01:18:52,830 --> 01:18:53,663
any idea is,

2834
01:18:53,790 --> 01:18:54,031
you know,

2835
01:18:54,031 --> 01:18:54,630
they were,

2836
01:18:54,630 --> 01:18:54,991
you know,

2837
01:18:54,991 --> 01:18:55,950
I really don't know,

2838
01:18:56,040 --> 01:18:56,620
to be honest with

2839
01:18:56,620 --> 01:18:56,791
it.

2840
01:18:56,791 --> 01:18:57,960
Still wasn't popular.

2841
01:18:58,470 --> 01:18:59,730
It's still way more popular.

2842
01:18:59,731 --> 01:19:01,020
Even now overseas,

2843
01:19:01,021 --> 01:19:02,500
like I get letters all the time from,

2844
01:19:02,670 --> 01:19:05,040
there's a new place that opened up
in London and I believe this one in

2845
01:19:05,041 --> 01:19:08,940
Manchester that opened up and I get
messages from those guys all the time.

2846
01:19:09,240 --> 01:19:14,100
So I know it's there are opening up new
ones so it's not like it's already there

2847
01:19:14,101 --> 01:19:14,934
and established.

2848
01:19:15,080 --> 01:19:16,580
Well that's what we were
talking about earlier.

2849
01:19:16,581 --> 01:19:18,080
A little bit on the way over here.

2850
01:19:18,081 --> 01:19:20,360
We got a chance to have a little
brief discussion about the uh,

2851
01:19:20,840 --> 01:19:21,081
you know,

2852
01:19:21,081 --> 01:19:21,281
the,

2853
01:19:21,281 --> 01:19:22,150
the future in the,

2854
01:19:22,151 --> 01:19:24,530
in the industry there I
got a chance to show you,

2855
01:19:24,531 --> 01:19:25,364
uh,

2856
01:19:25,420 --> 01:19:26,030
uh,

2857
01:19:26,030 --> 01:19:27,200
some of these uh,

2858
01:19:27,350 --> 01:19:29,830
rules and regulations
now that had been uh,

2859
01:19:29,900 --> 01:19:30,361
you know,

2860
01:19:30,361 --> 01:19:30,490
uh,

2861
01:19:30,490 --> 01:19:32,270
pinned up by you know,

2862
01:19:32,271 --> 01:19:32,930
the uh,

2863
01:19:32,930 --> 01:19:35,030
various health agencies,

2864
01:19:35,360 --> 01:19:36,193
NSF,

2865
01:19:36,230 --> 01:19:37,870
national sanitization foundation.

2866
01:19:38,250 --> 01:19:39,600
Well just explain that to people.

2867
01:19:39,630 --> 01:19:39,991
There's,

2868
01:19:39,991 --> 01:19:43,470
there's home tags and then there's
commercial tanks and you know,

2869
01:19:43,471 --> 01:19:44,490
people always,

2870
01:19:44,550 --> 01:19:45,271
when I tell them,

2871
01:19:45,271 --> 01:19:45,481
hey,

2872
01:19:45,481 --> 01:19:47,100
you should go to the float
lab and getting a tank,

2873
01:19:47,400 --> 01:19:47,701
they go,

2874
01:19:47,701 --> 01:19:48,061
wait a minute,

2875
01:19:48,061 --> 01:19:49,530
somebody's been in that tank before me.

2876
01:19:49,710 --> 01:19:54,710
That is a very good question and that
is a question that up until now has it

2877
01:19:55,921 --> 01:19:59,460
been like completely thoroughly
examine and your tanks.

2878
01:19:59,461 --> 01:20:00,600
Like when people come over my house,

2879
01:20:00,601 --> 01:20:01,760
one of the things they always look at it,

2880
01:20:01,761 --> 01:20:04,140
it's like the back of the tank
while the equipment is set up.

2881
01:20:04,141 --> 01:20:04,471
And they'd go,

2882
01:20:04,471 --> 01:20:05,790
what the fuck is all that?

2883
01:20:06,060 --> 01:20:06,451
And I go,

2884
01:20:06,451 --> 01:20:06,571
well,

2885
01:20:06,571 --> 01:20:07,950
that one ozone,

2886
01:20:07,951 --> 01:20:09,120
these ones are filters.

2887
01:20:09,121 --> 01:20:10,260
And like is that overkill?

2888
01:20:10,261 --> 01:20:10,531
I'm like,

2889
01:20:10,531 --> 01:20:11,700
I dunno what overkill is.

2890
01:20:11,701 --> 01:20:12,271
I don't know.

2891
01:20:12,271 --> 01:20:13,020
I'm not,

2892
01:20:13,020 --> 01:20:13,430
I'm not.

2893
01:20:13,430 --> 01:20:13,790
Uh,

2894
01:20:13,790 --> 01:20:15,570
I all I know is a tank is awesome.

2895
01:20:15,720 --> 01:20:17,100
Crash makes the best tanks.

2896
01:20:17,130 --> 01:20:18,720
If he says it should be like this,

2897
01:20:18,721 --> 01:20:19,860
then it probably should be like this.

2898
01:20:20,250 --> 01:20:22,690
But when you talk to people that
have other tanks that go to dot,

2899
01:20:22,700 --> 01:20:24,660
got like a little fucking spa pump,

2900
01:20:24,900 --> 01:20:27,870
I get a little spa pump that's about
the size of a basketball and that's it.

2901
01:20:28,230 --> 01:20:29,480
And you got like a,

2902
01:20:29,481 --> 01:20:34,481
a JPL fucking set up back there
with digital this and fucking porno.

2903
01:20:35,170 --> 01:20:36,180
More complicated.

2904
01:20:36,181 --> 01:20:40,500
As we get more and more involved with
the authorities like UL and UL is what

2905
01:20:40,620 --> 01:20:41,760
underwriters laboratory,

2906
01:20:41,761 --> 01:20:45,090
they do all electrical certification
for any kind of stuff like this.

2907
01:20:45,450 --> 01:20:50,160
These people that what had happened to
mine where mine shorted out is fairly

2908
01:20:50,161 --> 01:20:50,670
common.

2909
01:20:50,670 --> 01:20:54,030
I showed you the email too about
this and these electrical issues.

2910
01:20:54,080 --> 01:20:54,870
There's,

2911
01:20:54,870 --> 01:20:57,180
you got an email without naming anybody.

2912
01:20:57,181 --> 01:20:58,800
There was another manufacturer that,

2913
01:20:58,801 --> 01:20:59,160
uh,

2914
01:20:59,160 --> 01:21:02,850
makes pods and his pod
melted into oblivion.

2915
01:21:02,850 --> 01:21:03,031
Yeah.

2916
01:21:03,031 --> 01:21:06,450
He made some sort of a thing and it just,

2917
01:21:06,451 --> 01:21:07,860
it all fucking fell apart.

2918
01:21:08,100 --> 01:21:09,420
There's awesome ones out there,

2919
01:21:09,660 --> 01:21:11,700
but we don't want to
slink out or anything.

2920
01:21:11,710 --> 01:21:12,780
But for home use,

2921
01:21:12,781 --> 01:21:13,770
it's a different thing.

2922
01:21:13,800 --> 01:21:17,430
And a lot of these people are taking
these home use ones and they're using them

2923
01:21:17,431 --> 01:21:20,790
for these commercial places and all
these different people going in there.

2924
01:21:20,791 --> 01:21:23,460
And who knows if they're jerking
off some of them probably,

2925
01:21:23,550 --> 01:21:24,383
let's be honest.

2926
01:21:24,680 --> 01:21:25,050
Uh,

2927
01:21:25,050 --> 01:21:26,550
and where's that going?

2928
01:21:26,640 --> 01:21:26,971
You know,

2929
01:21:26,971 --> 01:21:29,370
it's like going through
your little spa filter.

2930
01:21:29,371 --> 01:21:30,240
That's not enough for me,

2931
01:21:30,241 --> 01:21:30,600
man.

2932
01:21:30,600 --> 01:21:30,781
Yeah,

2933
01:21:30,781 --> 01:21:31,614
exactly.

2934
01:21:31,700 --> 01:21:32,220
Yeah.

2935
01:21:32,220 --> 01:21:33,150
This is a video.

2936
01:21:33,180 --> 01:21:34,860
This is the video that Brian made.

2937
01:21:35,000 --> 01:21:37,290
Areas where the water is,

2938
01:21:37,291 --> 01:21:37,830
it doesn't,

2939
01:21:37,830 --> 01:21:38,111
yeah.

2940
01:21:38,111 --> 01:21:41,970
Well this is all the shit
that I've already said before
earlier in this podcast.

2941
01:21:42,540 --> 01:21:43,410
So differently.

2942
01:21:43,770 --> 01:21:45,210
That was before I got my nose fixed.

2943
01:21:45,520 --> 01:21:46,353
Why?

2944
01:21:49,390 --> 01:21:51,690
Underwater faces floating above the water.

2945
01:21:51,870 --> 01:21:53,660
But your ears are a subject.

2946
01:21:53,970 --> 01:21:55,050
We already said all this stuff,

2947
01:21:55,380 --> 01:21:57,630
but you can watch the video
and you can kind of see it.

2948
01:21:57,631 --> 01:21:57,781
Yeah.

2949
01:21:57,781 --> 01:22:00,300
My nose when I got my nose opened up,

2950
01:22:00,510 --> 01:22:01,590
changed my voice a little bit.

2951
01:22:01,830 --> 01:22:02,370
That's crazy.

2952
01:22:02,370 --> 01:22:03,930
I can breathe out of my nose now.

2953
01:22:04,920 --> 01:22:08,190
Yay for almost all my life,

2954
01:22:08,191 --> 01:22:08,490
dude.

2955
01:22:08,490 --> 01:22:09,240
I had no nose.

2956
01:22:09,240 --> 01:22:10,770
My nose was a useless piece of shit.

2957
01:22:11,070 --> 01:22:14,100
It was just bad Cartlidge
scar tissue in there.

2958
01:22:14,160 --> 01:22:14,993
But now,

2959
01:22:15,750 --> 01:22:17,860
now I can smell when Brian's
been smoking cigarettes today.

2960
01:22:18,600 --> 01:22:19,433
Busted.

2961
01:22:19,710 --> 01:22:21,000
Smell him a mile away.

2962
01:22:21,001 --> 01:22:21,810
This motherfucker.

2963
01:22:21,810 --> 01:22:22,160
Um,

2964
01:22:22,160 --> 01:22:22,800
so that is,

2965
01:22:22,800 --> 01:22:23,850
that's the tank from,

2966
01:22:23,851 --> 01:22:25,140
what is a video from Brian?

2967
01:22:25,460 --> 01:22:27,030
This is a wow,

2968
01:22:27,031 --> 01:22:27,651
it's a good question.

2969
01:22:27,651 --> 01:22:29,840
I would say in a while
cause thousand nine maybe.

2970
01:22:30,020 --> 01:22:32,330
Is it really the reason I
think it's been more than that.

2971
01:22:32,580 --> 01:22:32,930
Maybe.

2972
01:22:32,930 --> 01:22:33,800
I don't know if I said,

2973
01:22:33,840 --> 01:22:37,220
here's this was tank number one facing.

2974
01:22:37,240 --> 01:22:37,460
Yeah.

2975
01:22:37,460 --> 01:22:38,510
This is another,

2976
01:22:38,511 --> 01:22:39,344
uh,

2977
01:22:39,370 --> 01:22:41,180
see where like 12 steps from that.

2978
01:22:42,090 --> 01:22:42,923
You know,

2979
01:22:42,950 --> 01:22:43,800
Joe is a,

2980
01:22:43,880 --> 01:22:48,320
we've wanted to get over and switch it
out for him because he's a deserves to

2981
01:22:48,321 --> 01:22:50,440
have a more updated version.

2982
01:22:50,700 --> 01:22:53,990
He was okay with everything
but well craft against you.

2983
01:22:53,991 --> 01:22:54,411
Okay.

2984
01:22:54,411 --> 01:22:55,011
Is that good?

2985
01:22:55,011 --> 01:22:55,221
You know,

2986
01:22:55,221 --> 01:22:55,881
I don't want to hear,

2987
01:22:55,881 --> 01:22:56,690
okay,

2988
01:22:56,690 --> 01:22:58,130
well that's not okay with me.

2989
01:22:58,460 --> 01:22:59,780
Even if it's okay with you.

2990
01:22:59,990 --> 01:23:01,010
Still not okay with me.

2991
01:23:01,050 --> 01:23:04,000
And so that we were so
happy to be able to uh,

2992
01:23:04,040 --> 01:23:04,401
you know,

2993
01:23:04,401 --> 01:23:05,350
get you up to speed.

2994
01:23:05,500 --> 01:23:07,540
We still have some steps
to go for you though to,

2995
01:23:07,550 --> 01:23:08,200
we'd like to,

2996
01:23:08,200 --> 01:23:09,100
what are the steps?

2997
01:23:09,370 --> 01:23:09,671
Well,

2998
01:23:09,671 --> 01:23:10,380
you know,

2999
01:23:10,380 --> 01:23:11,380
this is the,

3000
01:23:11,390 --> 01:23:12,223
uh,

3001
01:23:12,700 --> 01:23:14,800
previous version now of what we have,

3002
01:23:15,160 --> 01:23:15,371
you know,

3003
01:23:15,371 --> 01:23:16,990
so as time goes by,

3004
01:23:17,180 --> 01:23:17,301
well,

3005
01:23:17,301 --> 01:23:19,880
the one I have now is even bigger
than the one that's in that video.

3006
01:23:19,881 --> 01:23:22,970
The one I have now is this
weird fucking meat locker.

3007
01:23:23,240 --> 01:23:24,073
Beautiful.

3008
01:23:24,610 --> 01:23:25,490
We're working on it today.

3009
01:23:25,491 --> 01:23:26,350
Feet tall and,

3010
01:23:26,430 --> 01:23:26,821
and salt.

3011
01:23:26,821 --> 01:23:28,640
And that means more than seven feet tall.

3012
01:23:28,641 --> 01:23:29,930
And I don't know how many feet wide

3013
01:23:29,960 --> 01:23:30,271
was he?

3014
01:23:30,271 --> 01:23:30,740
Six,

3015
01:23:30,740 --> 01:23:31,340
six,

3016
01:23:31,340 --> 01:23:32,540
seven and eight,

3017
01:23:32,600 --> 01:23:33,710
I think is what it is.

3018
01:23:33,711 --> 01:23:34,910
And that's a,

3019
01:23:35,580 --> 01:23:36,890
that's a great chamber there.

3020
01:23:36,920 --> 01:23:38,250
It's a good,

3021
01:23:38,260 --> 01:23:39,230
as you're using it,

3022
01:23:39,590 --> 01:23:40,221
see people,

3023
01:23:40,221 --> 01:23:41,700
that's the first thing that it,

3024
01:23:41,701 --> 01:23:41,960
it,

3025
01:23:41,960 --> 01:23:42,793
you know,

3026
01:23:43,070 --> 01:23:43,371
Oh,

3027
01:23:43,371 --> 01:23:43,671
you know,

3028
01:23:43,671 --> 01:23:44,750
I joined the gym.

3029
01:23:44,780 --> 01:23:45,411
You know what,

3030
01:23:45,411 --> 01:23:46,130
what does that,

3031
01:23:46,130 --> 01:23:47,270
you've got to go to the gym,

3032
01:23:47,271 --> 01:23:48,104
you know what I mean?

3033
01:23:48,160 --> 01:23:48,590
Yeah.

3034
01:23:48,590 --> 01:23:49,620
Get up membership.

3035
01:23:49,621 --> 01:23:49,940
Whoa,

3036
01:23:49,940 --> 01:23:50,241
whoa.

3037
01:23:50,241 --> 01:23:50,920
You know,

3038
01:23:50,920 --> 01:23:51,180
somebody,

3039
01:23:51,180 --> 01:23:53,900
some of these things sit in their
house and they don't use it.

3040
01:23:53,901 --> 01:23:54,061
You know,

3041
01:23:54,061 --> 01:23:54,650
what is it

3042
01:23:54,650 --> 01:23:55,361
people need?

3043
01:23:55,361 --> 01:23:55,950
Yeah.

3044
01:23:55,950 --> 01:23:56,340
It's,

3045
01:23:56,340 --> 01:23:56,981
it's hard.

3046
01:23:56,981 --> 01:24:01,180
But people need something to like
jolt them out of their normal everyday

3047
01:24:01,181 --> 01:24:01,631
routine.

3048
01:24:01,631 --> 01:24:04,960
They need something to jolt them
to get an old Dell try one day.

3049
01:24:04,990 --> 01:24:07,330
Like today I'm going to go to the gym
and they work out in the next day.

3050
01:24:07,331 --> 01:24:07,991
It's like fat,

3051
01:24:07,991 --> 01:24:08,710
fuck it.

3052
01:24:08,710 --> 01:24:09,220
They just,

3053
01:24:09,220 --> 01:24:10,060
for whatever reason,

3054
01:24:10,061 --> 01:24:11,020
it didn't catch fire,

3055
01:24:11,080 --> 01:24:12,040
but they want to improve,

3056
01:24:12,640 --> 01:24:13,031
you know,

3057
01:24:13,031 --> 01:24:14,110
and that's the first step.

3058
01:24:14,500 --> 01:24:14,861
But the,

3059
01:24:14,861 --> 01:24:15,170
uh,

3060
01:24:15,170 --> 01:24:15,310
the,

3061
01:24:15,310 --> 01:24:16,990
the actually doing things,

3062
01:24:17,260 --> 01:24:18,430
people have a lot of folks,

3063
01:24:18,440 --> 01:24:20,110
they discuss a lot of stuff.

3064
01:24:20,140 --> 01:24:21,820
They read about other people,

3065
01:24:22,180 --> 01:24:22,901
all these things.

3066
01:24:22,901 --> 01:24:23,681
And instead of like,

3067
01:24:23,681 --> 01:24:24,940
actually I sit down and say,

3068
01:24:25,210 --> 01:24:25,451
okay,

3069
01:24:25,451 --> 01:24:29,770
to what can I actually do today to get
to make me do something that is of a

3070
01:24:29,771 --> 01:24:30,604
value,

3071
01:24:30,820 --> 01:24:31,091
you know,

3072
01:24:31,091 --> 01:24:31,924
rather than,

3073
01:24:31,980 --> 01:24:32,161
you know,

3074
01:24:32,161 --> 01:24:34,470
these are the criticizing of
other people is a really uh,

3075
01:24:34,500 --> 01:24:35,333
you know,

3076
01:24:36,400 --> 01:24:37,990
it doesn't really help so much,

3077
01:24:37,991 --> 01:24:38,291
you know,

3078
01:24:38,291 --> 01:24:39,580
and well it's fun though.

3079
01:24:39,790 --> 01:24:40,240
It's fun.

3080
01:24:40,240 --> 01:24:41,410
I love to do it,

3081
01:24:41,411 --> 01:24:41,651
you know,

3082
01:24:41,651 --> 01:24:44,960
as a criticizing of other people's
oftentimes a good sense of a,

3083
01:24:44,961 --> 01:24:48,490
a source of the entertainments
and output to all right man.

3084
01:24:48,550 --> 01:24:49,000
I can't,

3085
01:24:49,000 --> 01:24:49,833
you know,

3086
01:24:49,930 --> 01:24:54,100
you have to be careful of criticizing
too much or getting only into the vein of

3087
01:24:54,101 --> 01:24:54,581
criticism.

3088
01:24:54,581 --> 01:24:59,581
Like you're consistently constantly like
people that are smart can oftentimes

3089
01:25:00,131 --> 01:25:02,050
make poor choices or dumb choices.

3090
01:25:02,290 --> 01:25:03,070
And I think one of the,

3091
01:25:03,070 --> 01:25:07,480
the dumb choices that a lot of smart
people make is to like consistently and

3092
01:25:07,481 --> 01:25:11,170
constantly look for the negative and
things consistently and constantly.

3093
01:25:11,380 --> 01:25:12,670
There's a lot of things you can focus on.

3094
01:25:12,671 --> 01:25:14,470
The negatives of things
are always going to exist.

3095
01:25:14,471 --> 01:25:15,160
You're not stupid,

3096
01:25:15,160 --> 01:25:15,970
you see them,

3097
01:25:15,970 --> 01:25:20,970
but to constantly and consistently like
only rally against dumb things in pop

3098
01:25:21,251 --> 01:25:22,210
culture over and over again.

3099
01:25:22,211 --> 01:25:24,370
At a certain point in time
I have to go listen what,

3100
01:25:24,371 --> 01:25:25,030
you know,

3101
01:25:25,030 --> 01:25:25,660
we see it,

3102
01:25:25,660 --> 01:25:26,350
we see it too.

3103
01:25:26,350 --> 01:25:26,841
Like what do you,

3104
01:25:26,841 --> 01:25:28,270
you're just angry about it.

3105
01:25:28,300 --> 01:25:29,050
Like that doesn't,

3106
01:25:29,050 --> 01:25:29,980
that doesn't help anybody.

3107
01:25:29,990 --> 01:25:34,300
Like what is either is either be funny
or shut the fuck up because we see it's

3108
01:25:34,301 --> 01:25:35,740
dumped too and it's not,

3109
01:25:35,741 --> 01:25:36,280
you know,

3110
01:25:36,280 --> 01:25:41,280
the funny part is best if someone instead
of Joe sort of added to the good part

3111
01:25:41,440 --> 01:25:42,131
of our culture,

3112
01:25:42,131 --> 01:25:42,371
you know,

3113
01:25:42,371 --> 01:25:42,790
added,

3114
01:25:42,790 --> 01:25:43,001
you know,

3115
01:25:43,001 --> 01:25:44,830
may come up with something
that's entertaining,

3116
01:25:44,860 --> 01:25:47,470
come up with something
that taps into what,

3117
01:25:47,471 --> 01:25:47,770
uh,

3118
01:25:47,770 --> 01:25:48,401
people would,

3119
01:25:48,401 --> 01:25:48,970
uh,

3120
01:25:48,970 --> 01:25:50,160
like to be getting here.

3121
01:25:50,160 --> 01:25:51,580
There's more than this
one if that one's empty.

3122
01:25:51,660 --> 01:25:52,000
Oh No.

3123
01:25:52,000 --> 01:25:52,600
Right.

3124
01:25:52,600 --> 01:25:53,230
I Dunno.

3125
01:25:53,230 --> 01:25:54,063
Either way.

3126
01:25:55,110 --> 01:25:55,943
Thank you my friend.

3127
01:25:55,990 --> 01:25:56,740
You're welcome.

3128
01:25:56,740 --> 01:26:00,770
I just think one of the things
is the tank provides is a,

3129
01:26:00,990 --> 01:26:04,610
this sort of introspective moment that
I think a lot of folks are missing.

3130
01:26:05,060 --> 01:26:05,361
You know,

3131
01:26:05,361 --> 01:26:08,180
and sometimes people get caught in
patterns and you can get caught up in a

3132
01:26:08,181 --> 01:26:09,380
pattern of negativity.

3133
01:26:09,540 --> 01:26:11,480
You can get caught up in
a pattern of depression.

3134
01:26:11,481 --> 01:26:13,760
You can get caught up
in a pattern of regret.

3135
01:26:13,790 --> 01:26:16,520
You can get caught up in
a pattern of friendships,

3136
01:26:16,521 --> 01:26:16,741
of,

3137
01:26:16,741 --> 01:26:17,541
of kindness.

3138
01:26:17,541 --> 01:26:19,880
You can get caught up in
a pattern of affection.

3139
01:26:19,881 --> 01:26:20,240
You can,

3140
01:26:20,240 --> 01:26:22,010
you can get into good patterns too.

3141
01:26:22,490 --> 01:26:25,100
You just have to reject the
bad ones when they come along.

3142
01:26:25,101 --> 01:26:26,000
Don't indulge.

3143
01:26:26,530 --> 01:26:27,490
It'd be ready for those.

3144
01:26:27,500 --> 01:26:31,270
You can just make sure that that's where
the chamber self aware going there and

3145
01:26:31,271 --> 01:26:32,290
you got to look at yourself.

3146
01:26:32,291 --> 01:26:32,830
I mean,

3147
01:26:32,830 --> 01:26:34,090
when I first started doing it,

3148
01:26:34,120 --> 01:26:35,260
I got an eye.

3149
01:26:35,350 --> 01:26:36,700
I didn't even know what
it was or whatever,

3150
01:26:36,701 --> 01:26:39,220
but I would be in for an hour every day.

3151
01:26:39,280 --> 01:26:43,420
I would go in there and it's beat
myself up because I was a damaged goods,

3152
01:26:43,421 --> 01:26:44,254
you know,

3153
01:26:44,890 --> 01:26:45,280
crash.

3154
01:26:45,280 --> 01:26:45,910
I'm not buying it.

3155
01:26:45,910 --> 01:26:46,743
Yeah.

3156
01:26:47,320 --> 01:26:48,560
Once upon a time on a sir.

3157
01:26:48,670 --> 01:26:48,941
Oh,

3158
01:26:48,941 --> 01:26:49,210
well,

3159
01:26:49,210 --> 01:26:49,850
I,

3160
01:26:49,850 --> 01:26:50,800
I would anyway.

3161
01:26:51,970 --> 01:26:55,330
But getting in there every day for me
for one hour in the beginning and see,

3162
01:26:55,331 --> 01:26:56,260
I didn't even know what it was,

3163
01:26:56,261 --> 01:26:57,580
but I knew that that's what it was.

3164
01:26:57,581 --> 01:26:57,820
I put,

3165
01:26:57,820 --> 01:27:00,520
so I'm in there and I beat myself up.

3166
01:27:00,580 --> 01:27:01,271
I'd come out of there,

3167
01:27:01,271 --> 01:27:03,640
I'd be like beaten up
and I'd get out and go,

3168
01:27:03,641 --> 01:27:04,474
wow.

3169
01:27:04,630 --> 01:27:05,650
I feel pretty good.

3170
01:27:05,740 --> 01:27:08,240
I could sit down and they used
to have a pa out there at that.

3171
01:27:08,290 --> 01:27:08,981
It wasn't a ranch.

3172
01:27:08,981 --> 01:27:11,100
I had a renter then in a
big screen and everything.

3173
01:27:11,560 --> 01:27:14,680
But I would come in there and I always
need people around me and stimulation and

3174
01:27:14,681 --> 01:27:14,951
stuff.

3175
01:27:14,951 --> 01:27:16,150
But I get out of that chamber.

3176
01:27:16,510 --> 01:27:21,510
I come in to all by myself and sit down
and not turn nothing on and just sit

3177
01:27:21,701 --> 01:27:25,150
there and feel actually
relax without use of drugs.

3178
01:27:25,151 --> 01:27:25,984
You know,

3179
01:27:26,110 --> 01:27:27,070
I'm reliant on,

3180
01:27:27,300 --> 01:27:27,520
you know,

3181
01:27:27,520 --> 01:27:28,121
certain things.

3182
01:27:28,121 --> 01:27:28,954
In the past too.

3183
01:27:28,990 --> 01:27:30,130
It made me feel different ways,

3184
01:27:30,131 --> 01:27:30,401
you know,

3185
01:27:30,401 --> 01:27:32,180
but the chamber now it,

3186
01:27:32,210 --> 01:27:33,190
it was able to,

3187
01:27:33,191 --> 01:27:33,431
uh,

3188
01:27:33,431 --> 01:27:38,431
affect the way I felt as a matter of
factly without the use of any kind of,

3189
01:27:39,611 --> 01:27:39,910
uh,

3190
01:27:39,910 --> 01:27:40,743
additives.

3191
01:27:40,760 --> 01:27:42,670
And when I learned about that,

3192
01:27:42,671 --> 01:27:44,080
that that's quite a,

3193
01:27:44,530 --> 01:27:45,700
that's quite an impressive,

3194
01:27:45,750 --> 01:27:46,840
that a game changer.

3195
01:27:47,290 --> 01:27:47,790
You know,

3196
01:27:47,790 --> 01:27:47,941
you,

3197
01:27:47,941 --> 01:27:51,610
you now have a window into yourself,

3198
01:27:51,760 --> 01:27:56,440
you can now go in and look at you
and see what that is and then say,

3199
01:27:56,441 --> 01:27:57,880
hey woo,

3200
01:27:57,881 --> 01:27:59,290
look at that with that is over.

3201
01:27:59,320 --> 01:28:02,080
Same thing because you're aware
of what you are and who you are,

3202
01:28:02,110 --> 01:28:04,210
what did you did and where you've
been and what not like that.

3203
01:28:04,211 --> 01:28:06,400
But you have to be willing to,

3204
01:28:06,460 --> 01:28:07,120
you know,

3205
01:28:07,120 --> 01:28:08,550
admit to all that surrender,

3206
01:28:08,560 --> 01:28:09,393
whatever.

3207
01:28:09,520 --> 01:28:14,470
And then you pick yourself up and start
to use what it is that you're able to

3208
01:28:14,471 --> 01:28:17,020
figure out about what to do from here.

3209
01:28:17,110 --> 01:28:17,943
Exactly.

3210
01:28:18,010 --> 01:28:20,380
And stand by it and then compromise.

3211
01:28:20,410 --> 01:28:23,770
And the tank tells you that
like give me the experience,

3212
01:28:23,771 --> 01:28:28,771
sort of introduces you to yourself and
there you are in this box and you realize

3213
01:28:29,531 --> 01:28:30,640
there's two parts of me,

3214
01:28:30,910 --> 01:28:35,200
there's this thing inside of me that
that apparently has better information.

3215
01:28:35,470 --> 01:28:39,360
And then there's this thing outside that
wants to get high or it goes to go see

3216
01:28:39,370 --> 01:28:40,810
chicks or do whatever
you're going to want to do.

3217
01:28:40,811 --> 01:28:43,000
He said go out and blah blah blah.

3218
01:28:43,030 --> 01:28:43,900
You eat too much.

3219
01:28:43,901 --> 01:28:44,950
People do different things,

3220
01:28:44,951 --> 01:28:45,231
you know,

3221
01:28:45,231 --> 01:28:46,210
and the gamble,

3222
01:28:46,390 --> 01:28:47,223
gambling,

3223
01:28:47,360 --> 01:28:50,860
this is all kinds of stuff and
cigarettes and we get a hit from that,

3224
01:28:50,861 --> 01:28:51,694
you know,

3225
01:28:52,490 --> 01:28:52,940
the,

3226
01:28:52,940 --> 01:28:53,773
you know and it,

3227
01:28:53,890 --> 01:28:55,750
but the effect that these things have,

3228
01:28:55,870 --> 01:28:57,310
see what they do is you also,

3229
01:28:57,640 --> 01:29:01,610
they will alter your perspective
of yourself sometimes have these,

3230
01:29:01,820 --> 01:29:02,220
these studies,

3231
01:29:02,220 --> 01:29:03,810
how people are drunk and they're all like,

3232
01:29:03,840 --> 01:29:04,150
ah,

3233
01:29:04,150 --> 01:29:04,591
la La,

3234
01:29:04,591 --> 01:29:04,801
la,

3235
01:29:04,801 --> 01:29:05,011
La,

3236
01:29:05,011 --> 01:29:05,580
you know,

3237
01:29:05,580 --> 01:29:06,241
and they're really,

3238
01:29:06,241 --> 01:29:06,480
you know,

3239
01:29:06,480 --> 01:29:11,400
it kind of gives them an impression
that they're more happy to be around or

3240
01:29:11,401 --> 01:29:12,234
something.

3241
01:29:12,320 --> 01:29:14,820
The drunker they get the
stupid or they seem to be,

3242
01:29:15,270 --> 01:29:18,300
but they don't seem to evaluate
themselves from that perspective.

3243
01:29:18,301 --> 01:29:20,010
They think they're more fun or something.

3244
01:29:20,120 --> 01:29:20,271
Yeah.

3245
01:29:20,271 --> 01:29:23,600
Self evaluation is one of
the hardest things to do.

3246
01:29:23,630 --> 01:29:23,990
Right.

3247
01:29:23,990 --> 01:29:25,810
It's the one of the hardest
things for a person to do to,

3248
01:29:25,870 --> 01:29:28,010
to step away from their,

3249
01:29:28,070 --> 01:29:32,930
whatever inaccuracies they've been
telling themselves to make themselves feel

3250
01:29:32,931 --> 01:29:35,000
better about their life
or their situation.

3251
01:29:35,330 --> 01:29:36,650
And then to force yourself to go,

3252
01:29:36,651 --> 01:29:37,400
you know,

3253
01:29:37,400 --> 01:29:38,001
this is,

3254
01:29:38,001 --> 01:29:38,840
this is not right.

3255
01:29:38,870 --> 01:29:39,990
This is this,

3256
01:29:40,000 --> 01:29:40,940
this society

3257
01:29:41,030 --> 01:29:43,070
has an influence on you as well.

3258
01:29:43,250 --> 01:29:44,480
Cause you don't want to look too,

3259
01:29:44,780 --> 01:29:45,613
like you're saying,

3260
01:29:45,740 --> 01:29:46,400
you know,

3261
01:29:46,400 --> 01:29:47,930
I can remember certainly
want to get into this.

3262
01:29:48,070 --> 01:29:50,390
They start talking about
certain things and people go,

3263
01:29:50,750 --> 01:29:50,991
oh,

3264
01:29:50,991 --> 01:29:51,280
you know,

3265
01:29:51,280 --> 01:29:52,940
I said I don't want to talk
about that or anything like that.

3266
01:29:53,150 --> 01:29:54,770
So you got to have a,

3267
01:29:54,860 --> 01:29:56,600
it's good to work on yourself.

3268
01:29:56,630 --> 01:29:56,800
This,

3269
01:29:56,800 --> 01:29:58,250
I'm big on this selfish Chisholm.

3270
01:29:58,280 --> 01:29:59,113
I think of it

3271
01:29:59,150 --> 01:30:02,150
saying though about people not
wanting to talk about certain things.

3272
01:30:02,151 --> 01:30:03,080
Like what kind of things?

3273
01:30:03,410 --> 01:30:03,891
Well,

3274
01:30:03,891 --> 01:30:05,390
a conspiracy theories.

3275
01:30:05,480 --> 01:30:05,661
Yeah,

3276
01:30:05,661 --> 01:30:06,340
stuff like that.

3277
01:30:06,340 --> 01:30:06,560
You know,

3278
01:30:06,560 --> 01:30:08,960
I kind of a negative
thing because when I was,

3279
01:30:08,990 --> 01:30:09,440
you know,

3280
01:30:09,440 --> 01:30:10,640
in Vegas,

3281
01:30:10,641 --> 01:30:13,780
the same place and the
guy loading is showing,

3282
01:30:13,820 --> 01:30:14,090
right?

3283
01:30:14,090 --> 01:30:14,990
And the truck driver goes,

3284
01:30:15,020 --> 01:30:15,141
oh,

3285
01:30:15,141 --> 01:30:16,100
there's the Kim planes.

3286
01:30:16,190 --> 01:30:16,401
I go,

3287
01:30:16,401 --> 01:30:17,234
what?

3288
01:30:17,240 --> 01:30:17,481
He goes,

3289
01:30:17,481 --> 01:30:17,590
hey,

3290
01:30:17,590 --> 01:30:18,081
look at that.

3291
01:30:18,081 --> 01:30:18,650
And I go,

3292
01:30:18,650 --> 01:30:19,220
oh my God,

3293
01:30:19,220 --> 01:30:20,053
I couldn't believe it.

3294
01:30:20,090 --> 01:30:21,690
There's airplanes spraying this magazine.

3295
01:30:22,130 --> 01:30:22,850
Unbelievable.

3296
01:30:22,850 --> 01:30:25,550
So I was damaged goods from that.

3297
01:30:25,551 --> 01:30:27,260
That messed me up for years.

3298
01:30:27,261 --> 01:30:30,110
And he said he quit telling people
about it because they're on the,

3299
01:30:30,140 --> 01:30:31,010
he's driving a truck and go,

3300
01:30:31,011 --> 01:30:31,321
oh yeah,

3301
01:30:31,321 --> 01:30:32,690
I take another hit on the crack pipe.

3302
01:30:32,960 --> 01:30:33,770
Meanwhile,

3303
01:30:33,770 --> 01:30:35,180
there it is right in front of you.

3304
01:30:35,630 --> 01:30:39,020
He should stop telling people about it
and you should just go on Google and find

3305
01:30:39,021 --> 01:30:39,980
out what it actually is.

3306
01:30:39,980 --> 01:30:41,000
There was nothing.

3307
01:30:41,090 --> 01:30:42,740
This is like 15 years ago.

3308
01:30:42,900 --> 01:30:43,220
Well,

3309
01:30:43,220 --> 01:30:45,320
it's not chem trails seat.

3310
01:30:45,340 --> 01:30:46,910
This is where people are really confused.

3311
01:30:46,940 --> 01:30:50,630
It's just airplanes create artificial
clouds and hazy environments.

3312
01:30:50,930 --> 01:30:53,870
If an airplane is going through the
atmosphere and there's a certain amount of

3313
01:30:53,871 --> 01:30:54,531
condensation,

3314
01:30:54,531 --> 01:30:55,880
it creates an artificial cloud.

3315
01:30:56,390 --> 01:30:59,750
It just does the jet engine that you
mean you should look into this more than

3316
01:30:59,751 --> 01:31:02,720
anybody because you've talked to me
about this before and I know that you

3317
01:31:02,721 --> 01:31:05,030
probably have these ideas in your head,

3318
01:31:05,220 --> 01:31:05,510
um,

3319
01:31:05,510 --> 01:31:07,700
about the government
spraying things in the sky.

3320
01:31:07,880 --> 01:31:09,680
Say I'm sure whoever it is,

3321
01:31:09,740 --> 01:31:10,573
airplanes.

3322
01:31:10,790 --> 01:31:13,880
Someone may have done that
at some point in time.

3323
01:31:13,910 --> 01:31:16,280
Most likely has done
that some point in time,

3324
01:31:16,490 --> 01:31:17,540
but that's not what you're saying.

3325
01:31:17,660 --> 01:31:19,490
What are you seeing those
clouds that go across,

3326
01:31:19,491 --> 01:31:20,480
those are actual clouds,

3327
01:31:20,690 --> 01:31:22,490
clouds that be made by jet engine.

3328
01:31:22,491 --> 01:31:24,500
It's like this has all been proven.

3329
01:31:24,500 --> 01:31:27,470
This is all scientific
that everyone agrees on it.

3330
01:31:27,471 --> 01:31:27,861
It's not,

3331
01:31:27,861 --> 01:31:31,370
there's no controversy about this at all
when it comes to people who understand

3332
01:31:31,371 --> 01:31:35,600
jet propellant engines or jet engines
and airplanes and airplanes and an

3333
01:31:35,601 --> 01:31:39,920
atmosphere conditions like there's been
articles about this since the 1980s I

3334
01:31:39,921 --> 01:31:40,520
mean this,

3335
01:31:40,520 --> 01:31:45,200
all it is is in in 2001 when
September 11th happened,

3336
01:31:45,440 --> 01:31:46,110
there was a,

3337
01:31:46,110 --> 01:31:51,110
an article that was on cnn.com like a
couple of days afterwards that was talking

3338
01:31:52,401 --> 01:31:56,930
about the changes in the
temperature because there
weren't the artificial clouds

3339
01:31:57,050 --> 01:32:00,940
that were used to having overhead on a
daily that are created when planes fly

3340
01:32:00,941 --> 01:32:01,810
through the atmosphere.

3341
01:32:01,960 --> 01:32:05,140
So it's not something that they
were being like secretive about.

3342
01:32:05,320 --> 01:32:07,600
This is just an effect of airplanes.

3343
01:32:08,020 --> 01:32:09,110
The real camp trail,

3344
01:32:09,111 --> 01:32:11,650
it was one of the things that I said on
my television show when we covered this.

3345
01:32:12,090 --> 01:32:15,580
They're burning jet fuel in the sky.

3346
01:32:15,670 --> 01:32:16,840
That's the real chem trail.

3347
01:32:16,850 --> 01:32:17,220
You're,

3348
01:32:17,220 --> 01:32:20,530
we're polluting the sky and we just
love it because we can get across the

3349
01:32:20,531 --> 01:32:24,500
country in in five hours and that's
where guys like Elon Musk and these

3350
01:32:24,700 --> 01:32:25,271
geniuses,

3351
01:32:25,271 --> 01:32:27,820
they want to create these
incredible high speed trains.

3352
01:32:27,821 --> 01:32:30,880
That's what these guys are so amazing
because if they can figure out how to do

3353
01:32:30,881 --> 01:32:34,420
that and use the same sort of
technology that keeps Google cars safe,

3354
01:32:34,540 --> 01:32:36,220
and if everybody can work
together and make these,

3355
01:32:36,340 --> 01:32:38,410
we might be able to
change the environment.

3356
01:32:38,411 --> 01:32:40,060
Like the amount of jet fuel that we burn.

3357
01:32:40,061 --> 01:32:43,120
It's like thousands and
thousands of flights every hour,

3358
01:32:43,121 --> 01:32:44,200
all across the country,

3359
01:32:44,201 --> 01:32:45,700
constantly going back and forth.

3360
01:32:45,960 --> 01:32:49,290
Rocket ships apparently take a
lot of a propulsion to get out.

3361
01:32:49,291 --> 01:32:51,480
There's a credible amount of rocket ships.

3362
01:32:51,520 --> 01:32:52,380
I talked to him and they,

3363
01:32:52,381 --> 01:32:52,950
uh,

3364
01:32:52,950 --> 01:32:53,221
they say,

3365
01:32:53,221 --> 01:32:53,520
oh yeah,

3366
01:32:53,520 --> 01:32:54,270
the,

3367
01:32:54,270 --> 01:32:54,511
the,

3368
01:32:54,511 --> 01:32:54,790
the,

3369
01:32:54,790 --> 01:32:58,290
the biggest thing is the pollution that's
created when these things blast off

3370
01:32:58,291 --> 01:32:59,124
the amount of,

3371
01:32:59,180 --> 01:33:00,013
uh,

3372
01:33:00,300 --> 01:33:01,830
whatever it goes into the horse fair.

3373
01:33:01,870 --> 01:33:02,550
But look,

3374
01:33:02,550 --> 01:33:03,540
you see fire,

3375
01:33:03,930 --> 01:33:04,763
yeah.

3376
01:33:05,580 --> 01:33:06,151
Fire.

3377
01:33:06,151 --> 01:33:08,700
Unless something that's
not good is on fire,

3378
01:33:09,200 --> 01:33:09,440
you know,

3379
01:33:09,440 --> 01:33:10,830
fires coming out of a metal tube.

3380
01:33:10,831 --> 01:33:11,940
That's never good.

3381
01:33:12,360 --> 01:33:12,751
It's never,

3382
01:33:12,751 --> 01:33:17,751
what's good now is that people have that
opportunity to investigate information.

3383
01:33:18,270 --> 01:33:19,500
That's why right now I think that,

3384
01:33:19,530 --> 01:33:19,710
uh,

3385
01:33:19,710 --> 01:33:20,130
you know,

3386
01:33:20,130 --> 01:33:20,490
uh,

3387
01:33:20,490 --> 01:33:23,790
ignorance and a negligence
or sort of the same thing.

3388
01:33:24,040 --> 01:33:24,690
They're like,

3389
01:33:24,690 --> 01:33:25,050
people say,

3390
01:33:25,050 --> 01:33:25,321
oh,

3391
01:33:25,321 --> 01:33:28,110
I didn't know what you didn't know because
you didn't care enough to look into

3392
01:33:28,111 --> 01:33:28,280
it.

3393
01:33:28,280 --> 01:33:29,113
And that is true

3394
01:33:29,290 --> 01:33:32,040
times you get caught in a
situation where you don't,

3395
01:33:32,250 --> 01:33:32,641
you know,

3396
01:33:32,641 --> 01:33:35,310
you just still don't understand
even after all the facts are uh,

3397
01:33:35,400 --> 01:33:35,871
well you,

3398
01:33:35,871 --> 01:33:39,480
you also have contrary
opinions back and forth.

3399
01:33:39,481 --> 01:33:41,040
There's this legitimate are varied,

3400
01:33:41,220 --> 01:33:43,470
especially when it comes to
like certain historical events.

3401
01:33:43,680 --> 01:33:45,420
Like there's a lot of people
that wanted to talk about,

3402
01:33:45,421 --> 01:33:46,950
like JFK is a good example.

3403
01:33:47,070 --> 01:33:50,160
It's a lot of people that love talking
about conspiracies and electric wrap that

3404
01:33:50,161 --> 01:33:50,910
went up tight.

3405
01:33:50,910 --> 01:33:53,580
And when you have these conversations
with them and you look at the,

3406
01:33:53,640 --> 01:33:55,650
the contrary evidence on both sides,

3407
01:33:55,651 --> 01:33:56,700
pro and con,

3408
01:33:57,000 --> 01:33:57,301
it's like,

3409
01:33:57,301 --> 01:33:57,541
wow,

3410
01:33:57,541 --> 01:34:01,590
there's a lot of like massive amounts of
confusion as to what the actual events

3411
01:34:01,591 --> 01:34:02,424
where.

3412
01:34:02,440 --> 01:34:04,200
But actually so many people wanted him,

3413
01:34:04,201 --> 01:34:04,531
dad,

3414
01:34:04,531 --> 01:34:05,910
that you can't even pit the pit.

3415
01:34:05,940 --> 01:34:08,090
You couldn't pin the tail on
that donkey no matter what.

3416
01:34:08,130 --> 01:34:08,340
Yeah,

3417
01:34:08,340 --> 01:34:12,050
there was multiple people that
were upset with his actions.

3418
01:34:12,051 --> 01:34:14,820
Why would they be so lucky
if it was just a lone nut?

3419
01:34:15,140 --> 01:34:15,420
Yeah.

3420
01:34:15,420 --> 01:34:16,470
Would they be so lucky?

3421
01:34:16,471 --> 01:34:18,030
All those other people would be so happy.

3422
01:34:18,031 --> 01:34:22,080
So lucky because then the situation when
you have perpetuated to this point now,

3423
01:34:22,350 --> 01:34:25,920
if it was a lone nut back then in the
system was actually fail safe from

3424
01:34:25,921 --> 01:34:26,970
situations like this.

3425
01:34:27,150 --> 01:34:27,930
I think what the,

3426
01:34:27,930 --> 01:34:29,210
the knife 1960s

3427
01:34:29,210 --> 01:34:32,540
and the death of Kennedy and you know
the Kent state shootings and all that

3428
01:34:32,541 --> 01:34:32,841
stuff.

3429
01:34:32,841 --> 01:34:37,010
I mean as tragic as it is
for then and for those times,

3430
01:34:37,250 --> 01:34:40,610
I think that ultimately that kind of
stuff is sort of a reminder and a lot of

3431
01:34:40,611 --> 01:34:45,500
ways to the people of today about how
bad it can get if things get out of hand.

3432
01:34:45,501 --> 01:34:48,590
So when he stays start creeping
up on these infringements,

3433
01:34:48,591 --> 01:34:50,660
on civil liberties like
and people start rising up,

3434
01:34:50,840 --> 01:34:54,410
that's where you see things like
us going to Syria gets shot down.

3435
01:34:54,740 --> 01:34:56,570
I mean you see the entire country,

3436
01:34:56,571 --> 01:34:58,290
both Republicans.

3437
01:34:58,310 --> 01:35:01,670
That was the first time that ever happened
where they had made a plan to go in

3438
01:35:01,671 --> 01:35:05,190
and invade something and they did not
do it because of the voice of the,

3439
01:35:05,220 --> 01:35:06,190
of the public,

3440
01:35:06,191 --> 01:35:07,850
the voice of the whole public.

3441
01:35:07,851 --> 01:35:08,091
You know?

3442
01:35:08,091 --> 01:35:11,380
It's like how many Osca Publicans
at this point in time retire.

3443
01:35:11,500 --> 01:35:13,760
I don't care if you've got
a blue suit and green suit.

3444
01:35:13,761 --> 01:35:15,920
A per bastard please.

3445
01:35:16,420 --> 01:35:17,253
Thank you.

3446
01:35:17,320 --> 01:35:19,190
Broke and we're not
invading other countries.

3447
01:35:19,200 --> 01:35:20,750
What for what exactly?

3448
01:35:21,080 --> 01:35:22,850
We're not fixing the problems
that we have at home.

3449
01:35:23,000 --> 01:35:24,290
How about the fact there's no water?

3450
01:35:24,740 --> 01:35:25,910
How about the fact that Texas,

3451
01:35:25,911 --> 01:35:27,950
it hasn't rained in
Texas and fucking years.

3452
01:35:28,250 --> 01:35:32,570
You know California had like one rainfall
like over the past like three or four

3453
01:35:32,571 --> 01:35:33,260
months.

3454
01:35:33,260 --> 01:35:34,093
It's terrible.

3455
01:35:34,250 --> 01:35:36,710
I mean that's something to consider
this something to think about.

3456
01:35:36,711 --> 01:35:39,770
Where the fuck we're going to get
our water from desalination plants.

3457
01:35:39,770 --> 01:35:42,200
Maybe drain out that
fucking goofy ocean tire.

3458
01:35:42,210 --> 01:35:44,150
Those fish sucking up all the good water.

3459
01:35:44,240 --> 01:35:46,700
What's happening with the fish
all dead off over there too.

3460
01:35:46,701 --> 01:35:47,240
Everywhere.

3461
01:35:47,240 --> 01:35:47,840
What's going on?

3462
01:35:47,840 --> 01:35:49,590
That's a lot of times deal.

3463
01:35:49,810 --> 01:35:50,430
Um,

3464
01:35:50,430 --> 01:35:52,470
a side effect of pollution to um,

3465
01:35:52,730 --> 01:35:54,280
or it could be a side effect of um,

3466
01:35:54,470 --> 01:35:55,850
certain types of um,

3467
01:35:56,210 --> 01:36:00,740
like fish need a certain oxygen level
and things can happen and they developed

3468
01:36:00,741 --> 01:36:04,880
dead zones and the water and there's no
oxygen and all the fish just drowned.

3469
01:36:04,910 --> 01:36:07,670
You've seen that on the zillions of them.

3470
01:36:07,760 --> 01:36:09,050
Hundreds of thousands here.

3471
01:36:09,051 --> 01:36:10,880
There we looked all over the world.

3472
01:36:10,881 --> 01:36:12,920
It seems like there's
problems but it could be just,

3473
01:36:13,490 --> 01:36:13,761
you know,

3474
01:36:13,761 --> 01:36:14,091
whatever.

3475
01:36:14,091 --> 01:36:14,690
I don't know.

3476
01:36:14,690 --> 01:36:19,690
Well I think it's always happened but it
happens certainly because of pollution

3477
01:36:19,821 --> 01:36:20,181
as well.

3478
01:36:20,181 --> 01:36:22,300
I believe pollution is bad.

3479
01:36:22,520 --> 01:36:23,353
Don't need to say,

3480
01:36:23,360 --> 01:36:24,193
oh look,

3481
01:36:24,470 --> 01:36:26,510
it's okay cause it's only
this amount or we can,

3482
01:36:26,511 --> 01:36:26,990
we got to,

3483
01:36:26,990 --> 01:36:27,823
we got to camp.

3484
01:36:28,020 --> 01:36:29,120
We're containing it.

3485
01:36:29,570 --> 01:36:31,170
See this is the containment system.

3486
01:36:31,171 --> 01:36:32,390
See what do they do with that stuff?

3487
01:36:32,391 --> 01:36:35,720
Stuff in the ground from
waiting for Godzilla coming
at all about we're going to

3488
01:36:35,721 --> 01:36:38,840
collect this garbage and then
planted in the ground over here.

3489
01:36:39,380 --> 01:36:40,760
Well that's what a little kid does.

3490
01:36:40,780 --> 01:36:42,320
You know when you're sweeping up you just,

3491
01:36:42,321 --> 01:36:43,310
it's a cartoon.

3492
01:36:43,311 --> 01:36:45,820
You pick up the carpet and you
sweep it under the carpet pot,

3493
01:36:45,910 --> 01:36:47,040
that carpet down number,

3494
01:36:47,070 --> 01:36:47,720
no shit.

3495
01:36:47,720 --> 01:36:48,553
You know?

3496
01:36:48,620 --> 01:36:48,891
Yeah,

3497
01:36:48,891 --> 01:36:50,210
it's a very childish way,

3498
01:36:50,211 --> 01:36:54,860
but it's also the people that were
alive that implemented these systems.

3499
01:36:55,040 --> 01:36:57,170
I mean they're not alive
anymore and they were,

3500
01:36:57,530 --> 01:36:59,420
when they were our age,

3501
01:36:59,600 --> 01:37:01,190
it was a completely different era.

3502
01:37:01,310 --> 01:37:04,280
And then when you go
back to look at their,

3503
01:37:04,281 --> 01:37:04,461
you know,

3504
01:37:04,461 --> 01:37:07,640
the distance between us and the
1940s go back and look at the,

3505
01:37:07,700 --> 01:37:12,700
the 1940s and the distance between them
and the same amount of time and you're

3506
01:37:12,861 --> 01:37:14,300
in the 18 hundreds.

3507
01:37:14,570 --> 01:37:15,081
Okay.

3508
01:37:15,081 --> 01:37:18,530
You're in the like the times where
people were riding horses and they had a

3509
01:37:18,531 --> 01:37:19,700
paint their pictures.

3510
01:37:19,940 --> 01:37:20,330
That's,

3511
01:37:20,330 --> 01:37:22,580
that's how much distance has traveled.

3512
01:37:22,880 --> 01:37:23,061
I mean,

3513
01:37:23,061 --> 01:37:23,810
we really,

3514
01:37:23,810 --> 01:37:28,070
if you go back to 1940 and you look at
those guys that are running the space

3515
01:37:28,071 --> 01:37:30,480
program or work with those guys who
were involved in nuclear program,

3516
01:37:30,710 --> 01:37:31,371
how old were they?

3517
01:37:31,371 --> 01:37:33,620
They in their forties let's
say they're in their forties.

3518
01:37:33,830 --> 01:37:34,551
Let's say that,

3519
01:37:34,551 --> 01:37:34,650
uh,

3520
01:37:34,650 --> 01:37:39,590
they were born in the year 1900 and
they were designing and working on all

3521
01:37:39,591 --> 01:37:39,990
these,

3522
01:37:39,990 --> 01:37:44,570
these crazy technological innovations
from the time if you went back from them

3523
01:37:45,140 --> 01:37:45,621
too,

3524
01:37:45,621 --> 01:37:48,110
as far as us looking at the 1940s,

3525
01:37:48,310 --> 01:37:48,741
you would be,

3526
01:37:48,741 --> 01:37:48,921
what,

3527
01:37:48,921 --> 01:37:49,341
60,

3528
01:37:49,341 --> 01:37:52,550
74 years go to 74 years before that.

3529
01:37:52,670 --> 01:37:56,580
So 74 years before that is 18 fucking 26.

3530
01:37:56,580 --> 01:37:57,413
Yeah.

3531
01:37:57,560 --> 01:37:59,070
That's crazy.

3532
01:37:59,250 --> 01:38:02,580
They got a horse that
stop and think about that.

3533
01:38:02,590 --> 01:38:07,350
They're 1940 like world to us.

3534
01:38:07,351 --> 01:38:11,580
Like when we consider the 1940 world
is the early 18 hundreds to them.

3535
01:38:12,320 --> 01:38:12,900
Huh?

3536
01:38:12,900 --> 01:38:17,010
It's essentially two
decades or 2 cents on the,

3537
01:38:17,011 --> 01:38:17,670
uh,

3538
01:38:17,670 --> 01:38:18,270
just the,

3539
01:38:18,270 --> 01:38:19,010
you know,

3540
01:38:19,010 --> 01:38:20,550
the regular ratio.

3541
01:38:20,940 --> 01:38:21,940
When you start to consider that,

3542
01:38:22,100 --> 01:38:22,291
you know,

3543
01:38:22,291 --> 01:38:25,410
the exponential type
situation and other growth is

3544
01:38:27,360 --> 01:38:29,040
magnified as it goes on.

3545
01:38:29,041 --> 01:38:31,290
It continues to expand itself out.

3546
01:38:31,320 --> 01:38:32,153
No doubt.

3547
01:38:32,190 --> 01:38:32,371
I mean,

3548
01:38:32,371 --> 01:38:37,371
the growth and change between 1820 and
1940 was nothing compared to 19 four d to

3549
01:38:37,951 --> 01:38:39,030
2010.

3550
01:38:39,390 --> 01:38:39,601
I mean,

3551
01:38:39,601 --> 01:38:40,650
it's just this,

3552
01:38:40,651 --> 01:38:41,820
this is madness.

3553
01:38:41,880 --> 01:38:42,960
They didn't look ahead and you say,

3554
01:38:42,961 --> 01:38:43,794
oh boy.

3555
01:38:43,980 --> 01:38:44,460
Yeah,

3556
01:38:44,460 --> 01:38:45,690
I know it's going to be really weird,

3557
01:38:45,870 --> 01:38:50,730
but it's just so strange that we're
still running on the momentum of these

3558
01:38:50,731 --> 01:38:53,620
people's ideas as far as like
storage of nuclear weapon,

3559
01:38:54,360 --> 01:38:56,130
storage of nuclear waste,

3560
01:38:56,140 --> 01:38:56,973
reset,

3561
01:38:57,240 --> 01:38:57,751
reset,

3562
01:38:57,751 --> 01:38:59,700
but fascinating though real kids in.

3563
01:38:59,760 --> 01:39:00,880
I agree wholeheartedly,

3564
01:39:01,080 --> 01:39:06,080
but also as a person who's not involved
in creating nuclear technology and

3565
01:39:06,501 --> 01:39:07,470
they're not involved in any of that.

3566
01:39:07,471 --> 01:39:10,110
I find it fascinating just as an observer,

3567
01:39:10,111 --> 01:39:11,100
like looking at it all like,

3568
01:39:11,101 --> 01:39:11,281
wow,

3569
01:39:11,281 --> 01:39:13,950
this is really an interesting scenario
because it was created by these

3570
01:39:13,951 --> 01:39:18,951
incredible geniuses that lived as
long ago as 1820 something to them.

3571
01:39:19,620 --> 01:39:20,041
I mean,

3572
01:39:20,041 --> 01:39:22,230
that is really hard to believe.

3573
01:39:22,620 --> 01:39:23,910
It's really hard to believe.

3574
01:39:24,020 --> 01:39:26,970
It's hard to believe is that we're
still operating on that same mechanism.

3575
01:39:26,971 --> 01:39:27,511
Exactly.

3576
01:39:27,511 --> 01:39:29,150
It's really hard to believe and it's,

3577
01:39:29,170 --> 01:39:31,470
it's hard to believe that we
still have like garbage dumps.

3578
01:39:31,471 --> 01:39:32,304
We have like dumps,

3579
01:39:32,890 --> 01:39:34,020
right dumps.

3580
01:39:34,140 --> 01:39:35,310
We'd take all the garbage,

3581
01:39:35,311 --> 01:39:37,240
we throw it over there
and then those dumps,

3582
01:39:37,460 --> 01:39:39,960
he started fucking disasters.

3583
01:39:40,290 --> 01:39:41,640
We went to a garbage dump.

3584
01:39:41,900 --> 01:39:44,630
Who Film something for the man showed
a garbage dump wants it was well,

3585
01:39:44,640 --> 01:39:45,480
it was horrible.

3586
01:39:45,620 --> 01:39:46,740
Well this is a horrible fucking,

3587
01:39:47,080 --> 01:39:50,580
they dig a hole and dumped the
throw all the shit there and stay,

3588
01:39:50,620 --> 01:39:51,690
just keep digging holes.

3589
01:39:51,720 --> 01:39:53,130
It fucking stinks dude.

3590
01:39:53,280 --> 01:39:55,630
They just cover it up with
dirt and it's disgusting.

3591
01:39:55,631 --> 01:39:56,060
It doesn't,

3592
01:39:56,060 --> 01:39:56,770
uh,

3593
01:39:56,770 --> 01:39:58,040
like the uh,

3594
01:39:58,210 --> 01:39:58,670
fume,

3595
01:39:58,670 --> 01:39:59,700
the methane or whatever,

3596
01:39:59,701 --> 01:39:59,870
uh,

3597
01:39:59,870 --> 01:40:01,500
build up if you put it under the ground.

3598
01:40:02,040 --> 01:40:02,791
That's a good question.

3599
01:40:02,791 --> 01:40:03,391
I don't know.

3600
01:40:03,391 --> 01:40:03,810
I Dunno.

3601
01:40:03,810 --> 01:40:05,970
I mean methane comes
from biological weights.

3602
01:40:05,971 --> 01:40:07,500
Doesn't want us that this guy took a,

3603
01:40:07,890 --> 01:40:09,960
a rat or a mouse and he,

3604
01:40:09,961 --> 01:40:10,620
uh,

3605
01:40:10,620 --> 01:40:13,380
made an art thing and he
covered up the mouse with the,

3606
01:40:13,381 --> 01:40:13,770
uh,

3607
01:40:13,770 --> 01:40:14,490
with the resin.

3608
01:40:14,490 --> 01:40:15,090
Right.

3609
01:40:15,090 --> 01:40:19,140
And then the mouse was the running
through the resident apparently until it,

3610
01:40:19,410 --> 01:40:20,520
it couldn't go into a further.

3611
01:40:20,521 --> 01:40:21,240
Right.

3612
01:40:21,240 --> 01:40:22,580
He was like stuck in the resident,

3613
01:40:22,581 --> 01:40:22,910
the mouse.

3614
01:40:22,910 --> 01:40:23,940
But that's an art piece.

3615
01:40:23,941 --> 01:40:26,130
That's an asshole is an asshole.

3616
01:40:26,440 --> 01:40:27,660
He glued a mouse.

3617
01:40:28,070 --> 01:40:29,880
So it's inside of this thing now.

3618
01:40:30,150 --> 01:40:32,990
And then there were in that
one day that was up on the,

3619
01:40:32,991 --> 01:40:33,760
uh,

3620
01:40:33,760 --> 01:40:34,950
it exploded.

3621
01:40:35,560 --> 01:40:40,560
That was like made out of a plastic
glass stuff and it exploded from the gap

3622
01:40:41,090 --> 01:40:46,090
that the mouse was offgassing from inside
of it and the mouse created so much

3623
01:40:46,981 --> 01:40:47,550
gas.

3624
01:40:47,550 --> 01:40:50,130
It blew this whole thing
up all over the place.

3625
01:40:50,160 --> 01:40:50,993
The guy told me,

3626
01:40:51,210 --> 01:40:52,020
whoa,

3627
01:40:52,020 --> 01:40:53,440
from the mouse being stuck in there,

3628
01:40:53,441 --> 01:40:53,951
the gas,

3629
01:40:53,951 --> 01:40:54,150
that

3630
01:40:54,150 --> 01:40:57,000
it was a offgassing as it died,

3631
01:40:57,020 --> 01:40:57,490
you know,

3632
01:40:57,490 --> 01:40:58,570
you know the smell you smell.

3633
01:40:58,940 --> 01:41:01,570
He said the house smelled like
that to w was you there for that?

3634
01:41:01,960 --> 01:41:03,010
I forget who was telling me no,

3635
01:41:03,011 --> 01:41:06,370
but somebody would come in and do the
mop down on the house and everything,

3636
01:41:06,371 --> 01:41:09,190
but that seems like an
unnecessary experiment.

3637
01:41:09,220 --> 01:41:10,420
You've got to remember that next time,

3638
01:41:10,840 --> 01:41:11,840
messing around with some mice.

3639
01:41:11,841 --> 01:41:13,430
Don't stick them in some plastic,

3640
01:41:13,740 --> 01:41:15,310
you know that they don't do well.

3641
01:41:15,400 --> 01:41:16,090
No.

3642
01:41:16,090 --> 01:41:18,640
Well there's plastics that they
can make from plant material.

3643
01:41:18,760 --> 01:41:21,190
Something a lot of people aren't aware of.

3644
01:41:21,191 --> 01:41:22,480
You can make plastic from hemp.

3645
01:41:23,190 --> 01:41:23,980
Yeah,

3646
01:41:23,980 --> 01:41:24,281
yeah.

3647
01:41:24,281 --> 01:41:26,560
It's a biodegradable plastic
you can make from hemp.

3648
01:41:26,750 --> 01:41:28,940
That's for drew made a whole car ride.

3649
01:41:29,820 --> 01:41:30,670
Ford made a,

3650
01:41:30,671 --> 01:41:31,510
the first car.

3651
01:41:31,810 --> 01:41:33,220
The offenders who made at a Hampton,

3652
01:41:33,240 --> 01:41:34,180
you could hit it with a hammer.

3653
01:41:34,450 --> 01:41:35,800
Hemp as a weirdest plan ever.

3654
01:41:35,830 --> 01:41:36,071
You know,

3655
01:41:36,071 --> 01:41:36,371
I'm not,

3656
01:41:36,371 --> 01:41:38,890
I know I sound like a hippie when I
started talking great about marijuana.

3657
01:41:38,891 --> 01:41:40,210
But forget about marijuana.

3658
01:41:40,310 --> 01:41:43,210
The psychoactive benefits of marijuana.

3659
01:41:43,240 --> 01:41:44,560
I've gone too in depth.

3660
01:41:44,590 --> 01:41:45,280
I think there's,

3661
01:41:45,280 --> 01:41:47,230
there's a real benefit to people and I,

3662
01:41:47,231 --> 01:41:47,501
you know,

3663
01:41:47,501 --> 01:41:48,430
I hear people saying,

3664
01:41:48,460 --> 01:41:48,731
Oh,

3665
01:41:48,731 --> 01:41:49,001
you know,

3666
01:41:49,001 --> 01:41:50,500
kids and what about the kids?

3667
01:41:50,501 --> 01:41:51,334
What about the kids?

3668
01:41:51,430 --> 01:41:53,230
What about the kids with fucking anything?

3669
01:41:53,231 --> 01:41:54,610
Kids can die from aspirin.

3670
01:41:54,640 --> 01:41:58,150
Kids can die if they have a
contest to see who eats more salt.

3671
01:41:58,330 --> 01:42:00,460
Kids can die doing a lot of fucking shit.

3672
01:42:00,490 --> 01:42:01,060
You know,

3673
01:42:01,060 --> 01:42:02,140
it's not about kids,

3674
01:42:02,141 --> 01:42:04,750
it's about responsible use of adults.

3675
01:42:05,110 --> 01:42:06,250
If it's your kid,

3676
01:42:06,370 --> 01:42:09,780
you have a obligation to
educate your children.

3677
01:42:09,810 --> 01:42:13,060
Do the best you can to protect them
from the dangers of this world.

3678
01:42:13,300 --> 01:42:14,860
All drugs are a part of that,

3679
01:42:14,861 --> 01:42:19,861
including hundreds of legal ones that are
available right now that can kill your

3680
01:42:20,021 --> 01:42:20,410
children.

3681
01:42:20,410 --> 01:42:22,330
So that's not the issue.

3682
01:42:22,360 --> 01:42:24,310
Marijuana is a minor,

3683
01:42:24,311 --> 01:42:24,881
minor,

3684
01:42:24,881 --> 01:42:27,130
minor issue when it comes
to health and safety.

3685
01:42:27,400 --> 01:42:31,960
It's a major issue when it
comes to consciousness and
maybe even more so when it

3686
01:42:31,961 --> 01:42:35,290
comes to the implementation
of hemp as a commodity.

3687
01:42:35,590 --> 01:42:36,700
Hemp for paper,

3688
01:42:36,790 --> 01:42:39,040
hemp for building materials,

3689
01:42:39,130 --> 01:42:42,280
hemp for automobile panels that
are lighter and more durable.

3690
01:42:42,550 --> 01:42:47,500
Henry Ford figured that shit out at the
turn of the 19th or the 20th century.

3691
01:42:47,800 --> 01:42:48,020
I mean,

3692
01:42:48,020 --> 01:42:48,170
he,

3693
01:42:48,170 --> 01:42:51,490
he was doing that in
the early 19 hundreds.

3694
01:42:51,580 --> 01:42:52,750
This guy had figured that out.

3695
01:42:53,200 --> 01:42:57,010
The pants they make out of it and shirts
and everything and they're durable.

3696
01:42:57,040 --> 01:42:59,050
They're way more durable than cotton.

3697
01:42:59,051 --> 01:43:01,600
And now that also has one
of the best root system.

3698
01:43:01,601 --> 01:43:02,434
So they,

3699
01:43:02,520 --> 01:43:03,720
with it did to do with,

3700
01:43:03,721 --> 01:43:07,360
what would it be good idea to do is
where you have these erosion problems.

3701
01:43:07,690 --> 01:43:08,920
If they plant weed in there,

3702
01:43:08,921 --> 01:43:09,101
the,

3703
01:43:09,101 --> 01:43:09,400
uh,

3704
01:43:09,400 --> 01:43:10,640
the rooting system hamper.

3705
01:43:10,650 --> 01:43:11,171
You got to see him.

3706
01:43:11,171 --> 01:43:11,860
He got to see him.

3707
01:43:11,860 --> 01:43:12,481
When I say we,

3708
01:43:12,481 --> 01:43:13,120
they think you're helping.

3709
01:43:13,120 --> 01:43:13,830
You want to get high.

3710
01:43:13,830 --> 01:43:14,663
Oh,

3711
01:43:14,920 --> 01:43:15,720
you know,

3712
01:43:15,720 --> 01:43:17,360
that's just that.

3713
01:43:17,370 --> 01:43:19,180
Just get in your own safety of your house,

3714
01:43:19,390 --> 01:43:22,040
this other stuff you could
put outside and let it grow.

3715
01:43:22,390 --> 01:43:24,280
Hemp is a very strange plan.

3716
01:43:24,310 --> 01:43:24,940
There's really no,

3717
01:43:24,940 --> 01:43:25,210
no,

3718
01:43:25,210 --> 01:43:28,330
no plant like it on earth and
it's incredibly hard and dense,

3719
01:43:28,331 --> 01:43:33,331
but very light is what seeds they make
that that Omega three to Omega six that

3720
01:43:34,720 --> 01:43:39,400
well the protein to hemp protein is the
most easily digestible protein and we

3721
01:43:39,430 --> 01:43:40,990
sell it at a on it,

3722
01:43:40,991 --> 01:43:43,480
we sell a a hemp protein supplement.

3723
01:43:43,481 --> 01:43:45,280
We bought the best hemp you can get.

3724
01:43:45,281 --> 01:43:46,270
It's really fine.

3725
01:43:46,271 --> 01:43:48,520
It's very high in proteins
to the most expensive,

3726
01:43:48,521 --> 01:43:50,980
but it's the best and a lot of
people don't like the taste,

3727
01:43:51,110 --> 01:43:51,950
think it tastes delicious.

3728
01:43:51,951 --> 01:43:52,070
But

3729
01:43:52,070 --> 01:43:53,780
I was fixing it up with coconut water.

3730
01:43:54,130 --> 01:43:54,600
I uh,

3731
01:43:54,600 --> 01:43:55,610
I just throw a banana,

3732
01:43:55,640 --> 01:43:59,540
coconut water and hemp force into
a blender and that's how I do it.

3733
01:43:59,600 --> 01:44:00,050
Yeah,

3734
01:44:00,050 --> 01:44:00,950
you're off to the races.

3735
01:44:00,960 --> 01:44:02,120
He tug just easy.

3736
01:44:02,150 --> 01:44:03,170
The thing about like,

3737
01:44:03,171 --> 01:44:05,330
I like a lot of different protein powders,

3738
01:44:05,331 --> 01:44:06,980
but I feel like the vegetable proteins,

3739
01:44:06,981 --> 01:44:08,120
I like pea protein.

3740
01:44:08,150 --> 01:44:09,860
There's a Vega that is a,

3741
01:44:10,220 --> 01:44:12,560
I think it's an all vegan
based protein powder,

3742
01:44:12,561 --> 01:44:14,390
all plant based protein
powder that I like to,

3743
01:44:14,810 --> 01:44:15,530
I liked that.

3744
01:44:15,530 --> 01:44:18,200
I liked those because
they digest very easily.

3745
01:44:18,470 --> 01:44:19,780
You're getting the impact from it.

3746
01:44:19,800 --> 01:44:20,270
Yeah,

3747
01:44:20,270 --> 01:44:21,500
I think it's also,

3748
01:44:21,501 --> 01:44:22,730
it's very easy on the body,

3749
01:44:22,731 --> 01:44:24,260
whereas I feel like whey protein,

3750
01:44:24,261 --> 01:44:25,670
which is also very effective,

3751
01:44:26,030 --> 01:44:27,220
but it's made from you know,

3752
01:44:27,290 --> 01:44:29,420
way which is made from milk products.

3753
01:44:29,450 --> 01:44:29,721
It's,

3754
01:44:29,721 --> 01:44:30,230
it doesn't,

3755
01:44:30,230 --> 01:44:33,250
that doesn't quite digest
as easily feel it feel like,

3756
01:44:33,260 --> 01:44:34,630
makes my farts stink here too.

3757
01:44:35,200 --> 01:44:37,330
They have to keep side so
that everybody's happy.

3758
01:44:38,860 --> 01:44:40,820
My body has no problem with digesting it,

3759
01:44:40,970 --> 01:44:41,600
you know?

3760
01:44:41,600 --> 01:44:44,430
And it's illegal to grow
in America from Canada.

3761
01:44:44,480 --> 01:44:45,320
Unbelievable.

3762
01:44:45,400 --> 01:44:46,071
So stupid.

3763
01:44:46,071 --> 01:44:46,761
When I was a kid,

3764
01:44:46,761 --> 01:44:47,594
I used to say,

3765
01:44:47,630 --> 01:44:48,980
I'm going to say my mom is it?

3766
01:44:49,030 --> 01:44:50,330
What is wrong with this stuff?

3767
01:44:50,331 --> 01:44:50,720
And she said,

3768
01:44:50,720 --> 01:44:53,240
oh well it's all legal and that was
the best they could come up with.

3769
01:44:53,420 --> 01:44:54,170
That's not even,

3770
01:44:54,170 --> 01:44:57,200
well that doesn't even work with
hemp because hemp can't get you high.

3771
01:44:57,340 --> 01:44:59,890
It's just the point I was worried
about the other part growing,

3772
01:44:59,900 --> 01:45:02,480
but growing hemp is like
growing pine trees was like,

3773
01:45:02,481 --> 01:45:04,730
what if someone came along and said
he can't show growth pine trees,

3774
01:45:04,731 --> 01:45:05,421
no more pine trees.

3775
01:45:05,421 --> 01:45:07,550
You can't make pine tables.

3776
01:45:07,770 --> 01:45:09,560
He can't make pine bed stands,

3777
01:45:10,120 --> 01:45:10,953
no more pine.

3778
01:45:11,080 --> 01:45:11,421
You'd be like,

3779
01:45:11,421 --> 01:45:12,410
what are you talking about?

3780
01:45:12,411 --> 01:45:16,700
I can't grow pine or rose fucking
crazy girl rose bushes stuff out.

3781
01:45:16,700 --> 01:45:21,440
But the preposterousness of pine is
a good one because it's so readily

3782
01:45:21,441 --> 01:45:22,130
available.

3783
01:45:22,130 --> 01:45:22,311
Well,

3784
01:45:22,311 --> 01:45:24,110
if marijuana was legal,

3785
01:45:24,170 --> 01:45:26,420
it could be as readily
available as pine trees.

3786
01:45:26,421 --> 01:45:27,890
The shit grows everywhere.

3787
01:45:27,980 --> 01:45:29,420
If fucking grows everywhere,

3788
01:45:29,570 --> 01:45:32,240
and for the past hundred years almost,

3789
01:45:32,270 --> 01:45:36,650
there's been this ridiculous
boycott on this magical plant.

3790
01:45:37,310 --> 01:45:38,300
It's a magical plant.

3791
01:45:38,570 --> 01:45:41,150
If it didn't exist and someone told
you about it from another planet,

3792
01:45:41,151 --> 01:45:43,220
we would be sending
spaceships out to get it.

3793
01:45:43,550 --> 01:45:44,030
If there was,

3794
01:45:44,030 --> 01:45:47,590
if we found that there was pot growing
on the moon and they found if the,

3795
01:45:47,591 --> 01:45:51,950
if the astronauts went to the moon and
they came back with a plan and over the

3796
01:45:51,950 --> 01:45:55,790
next decade they analyze this plan and
found it to have a million different uses

3797
01:45:55,791 --> 01:45:58,910
psychoactively medically to treat PTSD,

3798
01:45:59,090 --> 01:46:04,070
interocular pressure from fucking glaucoma
to give people their appetite back

3799
01:46:04,071 --> 01:46:04,910
where they're going through chemo.

3800
01:46:04,911 --> 01:46:05,151
They go,

3801
01:46:05,151 --> 01:46:08,690
you go through a laundry list of
benefits at this fucking alien plant.

3802
01:46:08,690 --> 01:46:10,910
Had they had do that fucking,

3803
01:46:10,911 --> 01:46:11,930
what's that Virgin Guy,

3804
01:46:11,960 --> 01:46:12,591
Richard Branson.

3805
01:46:12,591 --> 01:46:15,320
He's to be sent in space ships
out to the moon with farmers.

3806
01:46:15,380 --> 01:46:19,610
They'd have Mexicans in space flying to
the moon to harvest the marijuana and

3807
01:46:19,611 --> 01:46:20,450
bring it back home.

3808
01:46:20,660 --> 01:46:21,920
That's where we got along here.

3809
01:46:22,030 --> 01:46:22,380
Yeah.

3810
01:46:22,380 --> 01:46:24,740
And we got an ear and these kinds
of trying to keep it illegal.

3811
01:46:24,800 --> 01:46:26,510
Amazing dummies like that.

3812
01:46:26,511 --> 01:46:27,560
Chris Christie dummy.

3813
01:46:27,650 --> 01:46:28,620
I don't understand it.

3814
01:46:28,760 --> 01:46:29,211
It well,

3815
01:46:29,211 --> 01:46:29,780
I understand.

3816
01:46:29,780 --> 01:46:30,561
I don't dummies.

3817
01:46:30,561 --> 01:46:32,630
They re they rail against it.

3818
01:46:32,631 --> 01:46:33,421
They railed,

3819
01:46:33,421 --> 01:46:33,930
they rallied,

3820
01:46:33,930 --> 01:46:34,940
they scream,

3821
01:46:35,210 --> 01:46:36,740
cry corporate guys.

3822
01:46:36,741 --> 01:46:38,930
That what we need to do is
have them on the right side.

3823
01:46:38,931 --> 01:46:39,764
So you need to get high.

3824
01:46:39,830 --> 01:46:41,420
They need to just chill down and say,

3825
01:46:41,421 --> 01:46:41,930
listen,

3826
01:46:41,930 --> 01:46:42,410
Hey,

3827
01:46:42,410 --> 01:46:43,230
okay,

3828
01:46:43,230 --> 01:46:44,001
we're going to do it.

3829
01:46:44,001 --> 01:46:45,470
We can do to make things better.

3830
01:46:45,520 --> 01:46:45,920
Yes.

3831
01:46:45,920 --> 01:46:46,581
And get on board.

3832
01:46:46,581 --> 01:46:47,180
And then people said,

3833
01:46:47,180 --> 01:46:47,451
hey,

3834
01:46:47,451 --> 01:46:48,860
and the best ways for you to get high,

3835
01:46:49,200 --> 01:46:50,070
you got to grab them.

3836
01:46:50,400 --> 01:46:51,233
Yeah.

3837
01:46:51,240 --> 01:46:52,260
Or sell that stuff.

3838
01:46:52,290 --> 01:46:53,370
Don't grab a cat.

3839
01:46:53,430 --> 01:46:53,641
Say,

3840
01:46:53,641 --> 01:46:53,941
listen,

3841
01:46:53,941 --> 01:46:58,080
we use it in our product now we use this
stuff because we found it's better than

3842
01:46:58,081 --> 01:46:59,160
what we used to use.

3843
01:46:59,490 --> 01:46:59,880
Well,

3844
01:46:59,880 --> 01:47:03,300
I think there's a lot of things
that could be done to make people,

3845
01:47:03,301 --> 01:47:03,660
uh,

3846
01:47:03,660 --> 01:47:05,640
overall just overall in this country.

3847
01:47:05,641 --> 01:47:07,080
Just a wee bit healthier,

3848
01:47:07,081 --> 01:47:10,110
just a little bit of a change in the
dial and the direction that we're all

3849
01:47:10,111 --> 01:47:10,550
going.

3850
01:47:10,550 --> 01:47:12,720
I can remember an Anthony Robbins who a,

3851
01:47:12,721 --> 01:47:15,840
although I've made fun of a inspirational
guys I think is actually a very

3852
01:47:15,841 --> 01:47:16,674
inspirational guy.

3853
01:47:16,920 --> 01:47:17,191
Um,

3854
01:47:17,191 --> 01:47:21,300
I think Anthony robins has some really
good advice and I've read a bunch of

3855
01:47:21,301 --> 01:47:22,500
different things that he said.

3856
01:47:22,530 --> 01:47:24,810
And back when I was competing
and my martial arts days,

3857
01:47:25,080 --> 01:47:28,020
I actually benefited very
much from a lot of his,

3858
01:47:28,021 --> 01:47:30,840
he had audio books I listened to by the
pool when I listened to live in a shitty

3859
01:47:30,841 --> 01:47:31,674
apartment.

3860
01:47:31,680 --> 01:47:32,400
And um,

3861
01:47:32,400 --> 01:47:36,270
one of the things that he said was that
if you would take into consideration

3862
01:47:36,271 --> 01:47:38,040
like two cars that are a,

3863
01:47:38,070 --> 01:47:39,270
going in a certain direction,

3864
01:47:39,450 --> 01:47:43,590
if one of them just has a very
slight variation off the line,

3865
01:47:43,770 --> 01:47:46,020
just a slight over the course of time,

3866
01:47:46,200 --> 01:47:50,370
the distance that it goes
from the original direction
it was going to is vast.

3867
01:47:50,600 --> 01:47:52,140
It's just a small change.

3868
01:47:52,141 --> 01:47:53,550
Just a small adjustment.

3869
01:47:53,850 --> 01:47:55,350
And I think that could be said,

3870
01:47:55,351 --> 01:47:57,960
not just of cars that are
driving parallel to each other,

3871
01:47:57,961 --> 01:47:58,830
but if a culture,

3872
01:47:59,190 --> 01:48:03,300
and I think that if something like
the tank came along and the tank in

3873
01:48:03,301 --> 01:48:08,301
conjunction with this new found
refusal to accept the marijuana laws,

3874
01:48:08,820 --> 01:48:10,290
there's a new found refusal.

3875
01:48:10,530 --> 01:48:11,490
And now Colorado,

3876
01:48:11,491 --> 01:48:12,091
there was a,

3877
01:48:12,091 --> 01:48:12,361
um,

3878
01:48:12,361 --> 01:48:16,050
an article that was written that came
out today and I think it came out today.

3879
01:48:16,051 --> 01:48:17,460
I found out about it today.

3880
01:48:17,460 --> 01:48:20,340
I retweeted it today from a reset me,

3881
01:48:20,460 --> 01:48:22,530
which is our friend amber lions website.

3882
01:48:22,710 --> 01:48:24,380
And essentially it's,

3883
01:48:24,381 --> 01:48:29,381
it's talking about how Colorado has made
more money and had less crime and the

3884
01:48:30,091 --> 01:48:31,620
tax is six months.

3885
01:48:31,890 --> 01:48:32,723
Read about the school.

3886
01:48:32,910 --> 01:48:35,370
They gave him point 9 billion or
something for the school system.

3887
01:48:35,371 --> 01:48:36,390
The woman who wrote it,

3888
01:48:36,420 --> 01:48:39,420
or her name is Laura Pedrum and uh,

3889
01:48:39,421 --> 01:48:39,740
yeah,

3890
01:48:39,740 --> 01:48:41,460
it came out on the 27th.

3891
01:48:41,461 --> 01:48:43,350
So days answers school.

3892
01:48:43,920 --> 01:48:44,520
Yeah.

3893
01:48:44,520 --> 01:48:48,900
Can you imagine that they're
doing something on the
planet that's putting money

3894
01:48:48,901 --> 01:48:53,901
into schools and it's this
and it's empowering people
start their own business.

3895
01:48:54,540 --> 01:48:55,450
The right people,

3896
01:48:56,220 --> 01:48:58,410
people who are into weed,

3897
01:48:58,590 --> 01:49:00,450
they're going to start their
own businesses and get rich.

3898
01:49:00,570 --> 01:49:02,310
That'd be a weird thing when we'd,

3899
01:49:02,311 --> 01:49:06,870
farmers are like a bunch of rich
people running around funding schools.

3900
01:49:06,960 --> 01:49:10,020
We'd farmers are paying for the
police to have better facilities.

3901
01:49:10,200 --> 01:49:13,440
We'd farmers are paying for the fire
department to be better equipped.

3902
01:49:13,650 --> 01:49:16,290
We'd farmers are paying for the
teachers to make more money.

3903
01:49:16,400 --> 01:49:17,250
Like this is all,

3904
01:49:17,460 --> 01:49:18,630
it's not just a pipe dream.

3905
01:49:18,631 --> 01:49:22,770
This is all a very possibility with
the community and the officials in the

3906
01:49:22,771 --> 01:49:24,960
community to create a situation.

3907
01:49:25,230 --> 01:49:28,650
These guys could be major
influences on the entire,

3908
01:49:28,651 --> 01:49:29,730
not only this part,

3909
01:49:29,790 --> 01:49:30,680
right in the podcast.

3910
01:49:30,690 --> 01:49:34,800
People that are listening who are not
into wheat or like I'm fucking hanging up.

3911
01:49:34,830 --> 01:49:35,780
This stuffs are funneling.

3912
01:49:35,781 --> 01:49:36,780
Indoctrination.

3913
01:49:36,800 --> 01:49:37,090
Yeah.

3914
01:49:37,090 --> 01:49:37,923
Yeah.

3915
01:49:38,010 --> 01:49:40,950
Well even if you don't want to smoke weed,

3916
01:49:40,980 --> 01:49:45,150
how could you ever say that
$100 million in cash revenue,

3917
01:49:45,510 --> 01:49:48,220
$100 million is not a great thing

3918
01:49:48,220 --> 01:49:51,460
that you get that kind of taxes from your
first year and who knows where this is

3919
01:49:51,461 --> 01:49:53,560
going to go can easily
double by the second year.

3920
01:49:53,620 --> 01:49:56,110
So then you got $200
million in tax revenue.

3921
01:49:56,470 --> 01:49:57,303
Oh my goodness.

3922
01:49:57,330 --> 01:49:58,100
They focus where?

3923
01:49:58,100 --> 01:49:58,600
When,

3924
01:49:58,600 --> 01:50:02,980
how much of the tax that you paid
last month went to the school system?

3925
01:50:03,280 --> 01:50:04,113
Who knows?

3926
01:50:04,300 --> 01:50:07,150
How much did the school get to Colorado?

3927
01:50:07,370 --> 01:50:09,250
Colorado is not that big.

3928
01:50:09,400 --> 01:50:09,821
No,

3929
01:50:09,821 --> 01:50:10,451
I mean it's,

3930
01:50:10,451 --> 01:50:10,720
it's,

3931
01:50:10,720 --> 01:50:11,530
it's big,

3932
01:50:11,530 --> 01:50:14,530
but it's not like the amount
of people as California,

3933
01:50:14,560 --> 01:50:14,860
right.

3934
01:50:14,860 --> 01:50:15,521
Not even close.

3935
01:50:15,521 --> 01:50:16,810
So you spread that money out.

3936
01:50:17,220 --> 01:50:18,030
If you've got,

3937
01:50:18,030 --> 01:50:18,480
you had to,

3938
01:50:18,480 --> 01:50:18,591
oh,

3939
01:50:18,591 --> 01:50:21,490
also there's an 800 kids and
they made $1,000 or whatever.

3940
01:50:21,491 --> 01:50:26,491
Do you know how much money marijuana
would make in California if they just sent

3941
01:50:27,671 --> 01:50:29,440
it loose to set it loose?

3942
01:50:29,441 --> 01:50:32,020
Just unleashed it fully legal.

3943
01:50:32,110 --> 01:50:32,890
Let's go.

3944
01:50:32,890 --> 01:50:33,191
I mean,

3945
01:50:33,191 --> 01:50:33,700
just the,

3946
01:50:33,700 --> 01:50:38,700
the medical industry here is so gigantic
that there's businesses were doctors

3947
01:50:39,641 --> 01:50:41,050
just give people we'd prescriptions.

3948
01:50:41,050 --> 01:50:41,730
It's all they do.

3949
01:50:41,730 --> 01:50:42,280
That's all they do.

3950
01:50:42,280 --> 01:50:43,920
They have a line of people
with headaches out the door.

3951
01:50:43,921 --> 01:50:44,754
It's,

3952
01:50:46,530 --> 01:50:47,440
that's their business.

3953
01:50:47,441 --> 01:50:49,480
Everybody's paying 40 bucks
and they're keeping it moving.

3954
01:50:49,660 --> 01:50:50,560
And that's legal.

3955
01:50:50,740 --> 01:50:51,371
I mean it's,

3956
01:50:51,371 --> 01:50:54,010
what they've done legally is crazy.

3957
01:50:54,011 --> 01:50:55,420
If they made it fully legal.

3958
01:50:55,720 --> 01:50:57,910
If they just said release the hounds,

3959
01:50:58,110 --> 01:50:59,050
it would change the culture.

3960
01:50:59,230 --> 01:51:00,520
It really would and it would.

3961
01:51:00,521 --> 01:51:01,061
It would help.

3962
01:51:01,061 --> 01:51:03,580
A lot of people would help a lot
of people that are resisting it.

3963
01:51:03,581 --> 01:51:06,310
It would help a lot of athletes and
the big one that would help a lot of

3964
01:51:06,311 --> 01:51:07,510
athletes is edible.

3965
01:51:07,670 --> 01:51:10,030
Edible marijuana for inflammation,

3966
01:51:10,031 --> 01:51:11,050
for injuries,

3967
01:51:11,230 --> 01:51:12,220
for relaxation,

3968
01:51:12,221 --> 01:51:14,350
for stretching just for your body.

3969
01:51:14,351 --> 01:51:19,330
Just forget about the psychoactive
effects of introspection and self analysis

3970
01:51:19,331 --> 01:51:20,830
and all that other stuff that
comes with the eating it,

3971
01:51:21,070 --> 01:51:23,410
the really the physical benefits,

3972
01:51:23,411 --> 01:51:25,810
so it'd be pretty substantial
nutritional benefits.

3973
01:51:26,230 --> 01:51:27,070
There's the nutrition.

3974
01:51:27,071 --> 01:51:28,070
You already talked about that.

3975
01:51:28,110 --> 01:51:28,720
I can eat it.

3976
01:51:28,720 --> 01:51:29,553
It's really good for that.

3977
01:51:29,560 --> 01:51:30,370
Super Healthy,

3978
01:51:30,370 --> 01:51:31,203
great for your skin.

3979
01:51:31,210 --> 01:51:32,260
Hemp oil is good for your skin.

3980
01:51:32,261 --> 01:51:33,094
You can cook with it.

3981
01:51:33,250 --> 01:51:33,731
It's crazy.

3982
01:51:33,731 --> 01:51:35,030
It's just so much more with it.

3983
01:51:35,500 --> 01:51:36,340
Run a car on it.

3984
01:51:36,850 --> 01:51:37,511
You could run a car,

3985
01:51:37,511 --> 01:51:37,991
you get burned.

3986
01:51:37,991 --> 01:51:38,824
Hemp oil.

3987
01:51:39,130 --> 01:51:42,760
The whole thing is so ridiculous that if
you looked at it on paper and it wasn't

3988
01:51:42,761 --> 01:51:43,330
the same,

3989
01:51:43,330 --> 01:51:43,511
hey,

3990
01:51:43,511 --> 01:51:44,560
we have this stuff.

3991
01:51:44,561 --> 01:51:45,850
We just figured it out today.

3992
01:51:46,090 --> 01:51:49,780
It's called a slippery a
whatever and we have it.

3993
01:51:49,880 --> 01:51:50,680
What would be the great,

3994
01:51:50,680 --> 01:51:55,480
it'll be a great plot for a book if there
was a company that somehow or another

3995
01:51:55,481 --> 01:51:59,470
managed to plot against one of the
most beneficial plants on earth and

3996
01:51:59,471 --> 01:52:03,700
suppressed the the development and use
of it for almost a century if that,

3997
01:52:03,760 --> 01:52:08,530
if that was a book you would
like be captivated by this plot,

3998
01:52:08,531 --> 01:52:11,950
like could this happen cause this possible
the one of the most beneficial plants

3999
01:52:11,951 --> 01:52:13,900
ever known demand could be stifled.

4000
01:52:13,930 --> 01:52:16,720
They might've known about it in
the beginning and then cut it off.

4001
01:52:16,721 --> 01:52:17,020
Like I said,

4002
01:52:17,020 --> 01:52:19,240
oh this stuff could catch on.

4003
01:52:19,540 --> 01:52:24,070
I think that what happens is one of the
things that happens is when anything is

4004
01:52:24,071 --> 01:52:26,350
illegal and then you start
arresting people for that thing.

4005
01:52:26,560 --> 01:52:29,170
You make a business and I'm
arresting people for that thing.

4006
01:52:29,410 --> 01:52:31,420
You make a business out of
that thing being illegal.

4007
01:52:31,510 --> 01:52:33,220
And then like we were
talking about before,

4008
01:52:33,430 --> 01:52:34,990
when those guys are out of a job,

4009
01:52:35,110 --> 01:52:36,070
like they're just out of a job.

4010
01:52:36,071 --> 01:52:37,540
So they'll fight to
keep their fucking job.

4011
01:52:37,541 --> 01:52:40,780
And one of the best ways to keep your
jobs to keep more things illegal.

4012
01:52:41,050 --> 01:52:43,030
If you're a guy who
arrest people for Shit,

4013
01:52:43,180 --> 01:52:46,520
you want to make sure
that more like marijuana

4014
01:52:46,700 --> 01:52:49,130
stay illegal because especially the DEA,

4015
01:52:49,280 --> 01:52:52,340
what would they get do if
marijuana became legal?

4016
01:52:52,640 --> 01:52:56,990
And then people would start to have to
have to start considering all sorts of

4017
01:52:56,991 --> 01:52:58,670
other drugs becoming legal as well.

4018
01:52:58,700 --> 01:53:01,010
Maybe they could figure
out how to direct like the,

4019
01:53:01,011 --> 01:53:01,730
uh,

4020
01:53:01,730 --> 01:53:02,240
you know,

4021
01:53:02,240 --> 01:53:02,451
the,

4022
01:53:02,451 --> 01:53:02,870
uh,

4023
01:53:02,870 --> 01:53:03,380
uh,

4024
01:53:03,380 --> 01:53:07,450
business aspects of it just ready to
take this money now and we'll have a,

4025
01:53:07,490 --> 01:53:07,840
a,

4026
01:53:07,840 --> 01:53:08,673
uh,

4027
01:53:08,690 --> 01:53:09,620
an agency,

4028
01:53:09,650 --> 01:53:11,060
let's say that,

4029
01:53:11,110 --> 01:53:11,390
uh,

4030
01:53:11,390 --> 01:53:14,000
works directly with
these people that then,

4031
01:53:14,360 --> 01:53:14,601
you know,

4032
01:53:14,601 --> 01:53:16,550
maybe then they could have a place and,

4033
01:53:16,640 --> 01:53:17,660
and being helpful,

4034
01:53:17,780 --> 01:53:18,330
you know?

4035
01:53:18,330 --> 01:53:18,780
Yeah.

4036
01:53:18,780 --> 01:53:19,111
I mean,

4037
01:53:19,111 --> 01:53:19,771
obviously folks,

4038
01:53:19,771 --> 01:53:20,100
we're not,

4039
01:53:20,100 --> 01:53:21,990
this is not something that
we thought on an advanced.

4040
01:53:21,991 --> 01:53:23,550
We're trying to work
this shit out on the fly.

4041
01:53:23,710 --> 01:53:23,900
Yeah.

4042
01:53:23,900 --> 01:53:25,650
This is not the best way
to design a government,

4043
01:53:27,150 --> 01:53:28,830
but it might be better than
what's already in place.

4044
01:53:29,190 --> 01:53:30,100
You know what's already in place.

4045
01:53:30,101 --> 01:53:31,380
It's just fucking silly.

4046
01:53:31,410 --> 01:53:32,790
You can't tell people they can't have,

4047
01:53:32,791 --> 01:53:33,630
we'd stop it.

4048
01:53:33,960 --> 01:53:34,410
You can't,

4049
01:53:34,410 --> 01:53:36,170
you can't tell if they're very nice to,

4050
01:53:36,171 --> 01:53:39,160
to involve yourself in other
people's business like that.

4051
01:53:39,200 --> 01:53:40,770
They're not involved in yours,

4052
01:53:40,830 --> 01:53:41,820
especially if you're ignorant.

4053
01:53:42,090 --> 01:53:42,421
You know,

4054
01:53:42,421 --> 01:53:43,254
I,

4055
01:53:43,290 --> 01:53:43,680
I,

4056
01:53:43,680 --> 01:53:45,990
when I was first starting
to work for the UFC,

4057
01:53:46,140 --> 01:53:49,500
I would often encounter these articles
that were written that were critical of

4058
01:53:49,501 --> 01:53:52,980
mixed martial arts and I could tell by
reading the article that the person who

4059
01:53:52,981 --> 01:53:55,050
was writing it had no idea
what they were talking about.

4060
01:53:55,051 --> 01:53:56,430
They didn't understand the sport.

4061
01:53:56,690 --> 01:53:58,020
Like from a fundamental level,

4062
01:53:58,110 --> 01:53:59,850
they were incorrect about the rules.

4063
01:53:59,970 --> 01:54:02,550
They were incorrect
about what was allowed.

4064
01:54:02,580 --> 01:54:06,630
They were incorrect about the size of
the participants that they were one size

4065
01:54:06,631 --> 01:54:07,770
against eat all,

4066
01:54:07,771 --> 01:54:08,280
you know,

4067
01:54:08,280 --> 01:54:09,550
they didn't know they were there.

4068
01:54:09,710 --> 01:54:13,650
They were acting on really old
information and really bad information.

4069
01:54:13,770 --> 01:54:17,670
But yet here they are writing for some
loving an opinion in writing it in a

4070
01:54:17,671 --> 01:54:20,460
published form where they
spreading it out to the world.

4071
01:54:20,640 --> 01:54:24,000
That's what they're doing when
it comes to psycho appreciation.

4072
01:54:24,060 --> 01:54:25,980
It's like having a guy do a wine,

4073
01:54:26,040 --> 01:54:27,870
a wine review.

4074
01:54:28,170 --> 01:54:29,640
This never had any wine.

4075
01:54:30,390 --> 01:54:30,691
Yeah.

4076
01:54:30,691 --> 01:54:31,600
Well I'll,

4077
01:54:31,601 --> 01:54:32,670
I'll do you one better.

4078
01:54:32,671 --> 01:54:37,671
Anybody that is trying to get anything
like marijuana or mushrooms or any of

4079
01:54:39,151 --> 01:54:42,960
these things removed from the culture
and has no experience in them whatsoever.

4080
01:54:43,110 --> 01:54:45,930
It's like a guy who's never had
sex trying to make sex illegal.

4081
01:54:45,990 --> 01:54:46,823
It's mean.

4082
01:54:47,070 --> 01:54:47,430
It's,

4083
01:54:47,430 --> 01:54:47,641
well,

4084
01:54:47,641 --> 01:54:48,570
it's insane.

4085
01:54:48,610 --> 01:54:50,760
It's insane that anybody allows it.

4086
01:54:51,090 --> 01:54:54,660
If someone who has never had sex before
tried to make sex illegal to all of us

4087
01:54:54,690 --> 01:54:55,650
that enjoy sex,

4088
01:54:55,860 --> 01:54:56,191
he'd be like,

4089
01:54:56,191 --> 01:54:56,941
are you crazy?

4090
01:54:56,941 --> 01:54:58,440
It's like one of my favorite things,

4091
01:54:58,620 --> 01:55:00,210
like why would you cut the sex out?

4092
01:55:00,490 --> 01:55:02,520
Because I don't get sex
so you don't get sex.

4093
01:55:02,521 --> 01:55:03,354
I don't like it.

4094
01:55:03,360 --> 01:55:04,280
I don't appreciate it.

4095
01:55:04,281 --> 01:55:05,290
It rots your brain.

4096
01:55:05,350 --> 01:55:10,350
We can journeys and someone could just
somehow or another trick people and did

4097
01:55:10,411 --> 01:55:11,250
not having sex.

4098
01:55:11,310 --> 01:55:13,470
Obviously sex is a natural urge.

4099
01:55:13,620 --> 01:55:15,480
Marijuana is something
that you learn about,

4100
01:55:15,720 --> 01:55:20,720
but they're both beneficial and enjoyable
aspects of this beautiful thing called

4101
01:55:21,061 --> 01:55:23,670
life and for whatever fucking reason,

4102
01:55:23,760 --> 01:55:27,540
we've allowed these dummies that are
obviously like you look at a guy like Newt

4103
01:55:27,540 --> 01:55:27,750
Gingrich.

4104
01:55:27,750 --> 01:55:27,991
Dude,

4105
01:55:27,991 --> 01:55:28,260
you don't,

4106
01:55:28,260 --> 01:55:28,770
you don't,

4107
01:55:28,770 --> 01:55:30,060
you don't get to tell me anything.

4108
01:55:30,360 --> 01:55:34,530
You don't get to tell me what
to do or how to live at all.

4109
01:55:34,710 --> 01:55:35,730
You don't get to,

4110
01:55:35,760 --> 01:55:36,990
I don't believe in you.

4111
01:55:37,230 --> 01:55:41,370
You know I think your corporate puppet
and you don't get to tell me that pot's

4112
01:55:41,371 --> 01:55:41,810
bad.

4113
01:55:41,810 --> 01:55:42,990
When I look at Chris Christie,

4114
01:55:43,200 --> 01:55:43,980
you're 300

4115
01:55:43,980 --> 01:55:44,341
pounds.

4116
01:55:44,341 --> 01:55:45,630
You don't get to give advice.

4117
01:55:45,750 --> 01:55:47,370
You don't get to give advice.

4118
01:55:47,580 --> 01:55:48,001
Oh,

4119
01:55:48,001 --> 01:55:49,640
marijuana rots the brain and this.

4120
01:55:49,830 --> 01:55:51,000
What about your fucking brain?

4121
01:55:51,001 --> 01:55:54,060
It's allowed you to balloon
up like an other animal.

4122
01:55:54,150 --> 01:55:55,500
You don't even look like a human.

4123
01:55:55,680 --> 01:55:57,060
You look like some sloths,

4124
01:55:57,090 --> 01:56:01,830
some some walrus type creature that's
waddled out of the ocean and put on big

4125
01:56:01,831 --> 01:56:02,520
pants.

4126
01:56:02,520 --> 01:56:03,840
You're ridiculous person.

4127
01:56:03,841 --> 01:56:04,980
You can't talk about marijuana.

4128
01:56:04,981 --> 01:56:06,180
You don't experience it.

4129
01:56:06,390 --> 01:56:08,370
If you don't experience
it on a regular basis,

4130
01:56:08,371 --> 01:56:09,960
you don't know what the
fuck you're talking about.

4131
01:56:10,080 --> 01:56:12,090
And that's the problem that
we have in our culture.

4132
01:56:12,270 --> 01:56:15,600
We have these people that are giving
advice on something that they have no

4133
01:56:15,601 --> 01:56:16,150
experience.

4134
01:56:16,150 --> 01:56:20,140
Other countries we're over at
mixed up and other civilizations.

4135
01:56:20,160 --> 01:56:20,591
These people,

4136
01:56:20,591 --> 01:56:23,040
they are operating for thousands
or hundreds or whatever it is.

4137
01:56:23,041 --> 01:56:23,581
Exactly,

4138
01:56:23,581 --> 01:56:24,391
and we're going to come over and say,

4139
01:56:24,391 --> 01:56:24,930
hey,

4140
01:56:24,930 --> 01:56:25,380
here we are.

4141
01:56:25,380 --> 01:56:26,220
Now we're going to tell you guys,

4142
01:56:26,221 --> 01:56:26,580
watch it.

4143
01:56:26,580 --> 01:56:29,490
We need humility from
people that are leading.

4144
01:56:29,580 --> 01:56:30,600
That's a very important thing.

4145
01:56:30,601 --> 01:56:33,780
So when someone takes a big strong
stance on something that they don't have

4146
01:56:33,781 --> 01:56:36,510
experience with or they don't
have full knowledge of like this,

4147
01:56:36,511 --> 01:56:39,630
he was talking about some study
that they've come out with it.

4148
01:56:39,631 --> 01:56:41,160
Marijuana affects the brain.

4149
01:56:41,161 --> 01:56:41,371
Yeah,

4150
01:56:41,371 --> 01:56:42,330
it affects the brain,

4151
01:56:42,420 --> 01:56:44,430
but they don't know if it's good or bad.

4152
01:56:44,460 --> 01:56:45,930
Did you read that part of it?

4153
01:56:46,050 --> 01:56:47,790
They don't understand
what the effects are,

4154
01:56:47,791 --> 01:56:48,720
what the negative effects are,

4155
01:56:48,721 --> 01:56:51,450
but here's other than
short term memory loss,

4156
01:56:51,451 --> 01:56:53,490
no one's demonstrated anything really bad,

4157
01:56:53,640 --> 01:56:55,530
but a lot of positive shit,

4158
01:56:55,680 --> 01:56:57,000
tumor shrinkage,

4159
01:56:57,180 --> 01:57:01,890
all sorts of medical benefits to do with
deal with inflammation and relieving of

4160
01:57:01,891 --> 01:57:02,701
pressure.

4161
01:57:02,701 --> 01:57:07,701
And for a lot of people it's good
you guys still held up on your,

4162
01:57:08,500 --> 01:57:09,333
I hate that.

4163
01:57:09,550 --> 01:57:10,410
I forget it.

4164
01:57:10,440 --> 01:57:11,040
It's over.

4165
01:57:11,040 --> 01:57:11,880
Let it go.

4166
01:57:11,940 --> 01:57:12,601
Short memory.

4167
01:57:12,601 --> 01:57:13,410
I like that.

4168
01:57:13,410 --> 01:57:15,120
I got some good details there later.

4169
01:57:15,121 --> 01:57:16,590
They come up with me when I need them.

4170
01:57:16,591 --> 01:57:17,340
But uh,

4171
01:57:17,340 --> 01:57:18,060
it's just,

4172
01:57:18,060 --> 01:57:20,190
it's a carry garbage around
in your head all day.

4173
01:57:20,400 --> 01:57:22,230
Father knows best shit is what it is.

4174
01:57:22,470 --> 01:57:22,711
I mean,

4175
01:57:22,711 --> 01:57:24,000
we're watching leave it to beaver.

4176
01:57:24,150 --> 01:57:25,140
We just watching a,

4177
01:57:25,150 --> 01:57:25,983
a less,

4178
01:57:26,610 --> 01:57:28,680
less like ridiculous form of it.

4179
01:57:28,710 --> 01:57:30,270
It's a more modern person,

4180
01:57:31,050 --> 01:57:33,240
incorrect moral value on you.

4181
01:57:33,400 --> 01:57:37,740
They've decided what is right and what's
wrong without having enough information

4182
01:57:37,741 --> 01:57:42,741
to even have a valid perspective with
the gall of a man to say that another man

4183
01:57:43,561 --> 01:57:48,240
should not be able to legally buy
something as innocuous as marijuana is.

4184
01:57:48,241 --> 01:57:51,240
So enraging who the fuck are,

4185
01:57:51,241 --> 01:57:54,390
you can't smoke a joint
somewhere by herself.

4186
01:57:54,420 --> 01:57:57,150
Especially a person who
placates themselves.

4187
01:57:57,151 --> 01:57:58,260
Obviously you're not,

4188
01:57:58,290 --> 01:57:58,710
you're,

4189
01:57:58,710 --> 01:58:01,020
you're not some militant fucking like the,

4190
01:58:01,021 --> 01:58:01,261
the,

4191
01:58:01,261 --> 01:58:01,401
the,

4192
01:58:01,401 --> 01:58:04,080
the gunny and full metal jacket placate,

4193
01:58:04,290 --> 01:58:05,123
I don't know that word.

4194
01:58:05,150 --> 01:58:05,830
Uh,

4195
01:58:05,830 --> 01:58:06,663
you know,

4196
01:58:07,100 --> 01:58:08,490
what's the best way to describe placate,

4197
01:58:08,640 --> 01:58:09,001
like,

4198
01:58:09,001 --> 01:58:09,450
uh,

4199
01:58:09,450 --> 01:58:11,280
to make someone believe it.

4200
01:58:11,670 --> 01:58:12,960
Pretend like you're that way.

4201
01:58:13,260 --> 01:58:13,650
No,

4202
01:58:13,650 --> 01:58:14,760
to try to here,

4203
01:58:14,790 --> 01:58:16,830
I'll give you a pro to
make someone less angry.

4204
01:58:17,910 --> 01:58:21,480
I think it's based on placid
to try to calm me down.

4205
01:58:21,510 --> 01:58:21,721
Right,

4206
01:58:21,721 --> 01:58:21,901
right,

4207
01:58:21,901 --> 01:58:22,051
right,

4208
01:58:22,051 --> 01:58:22,231
right,

4209
01:58:22,231 --> 01:58:22,560
right.

4210
01:58:22,560 --> 01:58:22,980
Sorry,

4211
01:58:22,980 --> 01:58:24,060
I just lost my train of thought.

4212
01:58:24,260 --> 01:58:24,661
I'm sorry.

4213
01:58:24,661 --> 01:58:27,510
I have a limited vocabulary in
certain areas that you don't though.

4214
01:58:27,511 --> 01:58:27,910
You,

4215
01:58:27,910 --> 01:58:30,510
you have a very high
technological vocabulary.

4216
01:58:30,511 --> 01:58:31,420
I like to ask questions.

4217
01:58:31,490 --> 01:58:34,110
So now I have that word
in my repertoire as well.

4218
01:58:34,111 --> 01:58:34,944
So placate,

4219
01:58:34,980 --> 01:58:35,910
placate the masses.

4220
01:58:35,911 --> 01:58:36,810
You know that expression,

4221
01:58:36,840 --> 01:58:38,040
you've heard the expression a calm,

4222
01:58:38,041 --> 01:58:38,490
that acid.

4223
01:58:38,490 --> 01:58:41,980
I think I've heard the
word never understood.

4224
01:58:41,981 --> 01:58:42,814
What was I saying now?

4225
01:58:42,880 --> 01:58:45,490
What was I saying about
the people in the Oh,

4226
01:58:45,540 --> 01:58:46,660
that he placates his body.

4227
01:58:46,661 --> 01:58:49,120
He con he obviously he
gives into his urges.

4228
01:58:49,300 --> 01:58:50,133
In order to,

4229
01:58:50,530 --> 01:58:51,850
in order to be that big,

4230
01:58:51,880 --> 01:58:52,713
you have to be indulgent.

4231
01:58:52,750 --> 01:58:53,411
I mean there's no way.

4232
01:58:53,411 --> 01:58:54,310
So he's got issues.

4233
01:58:54,490 --> 01:58:57,460
So anybody that's got like some
obvious issue like that like,

4234
01:58:57,461 --> 01:58:57,671
man,

4235
01:58:57,671 --> 01:58:59,050
you're not allowed to dictate health.

4236
01:58:59,051 --> 01:58:59,510
And,

4237
01:58:59,510 --> 01:58:59,930
and,

4238
01:58:59,930 --> 01:59:00,270
and,

4239
01:59:00,270 --> 01:59:03,480
and like consumption policy theory yeah.

4240
01:59:04,510 --> 01:59:05,500
Is Poor.

4241
01:59:05,640 --> 01:59:05,920
Yeah.

4242
01:59:05,920 --> 01:59:06,540
It's ridiculous.

4243
01:59:06,540 --> 01:59:07,960
It's control on yourself.

4244
01:59:07,990 --> 01:59:10,660
It's also against the current data.

4245
01:59:10,720 --> 01:59:11,440
Like there's,

4246
01:59:11,440 --> 01:59:12,100
there's,

4247
01:59:12,100 --> 01:59:17,100
there's no like real consensus that
shows any sort of significant dangers

4248
01:59:17,531 --> 01:59:19,450
involved in the consumption of that plant.

4249
01:59:20,050 --> 01:59:23,710
Certainly not like some of these other
ones that have how many dead this year

4250
01:59:23,720 --> 01:59:24,130
from.

4251
01:59:24,130 --> 01:59:26,350
But you know why those
other ones are fine too.

4252
01:59:26,351 --> 01:59:28,270
I don't have a problem
either being around,

4253
01:59:28,271 --> 01:59:29,830
but aspirin will fuck you up.

4254
01:59:29,960 --> 01:59:30,910
You get crazy with it.

4255
01:59:30,930 --> 01:59:31,763
You know,

4256
01:59:31,810 --> 01:59:32,770
you're your own,

4257
01:59:32,990 --> 01:59:33,380
uh,

4258
01:59:33,380 --> 01:59:34,420
your own architect.

4259
01:59:34,421 --> 01:59:35,254
You know,

4260
01:59:35,260 --> 01:59:37,120
a lot of people die
every year from aspirin.

4261
01:59:37,540 --> 01:59:38,710
Aspirin kills people.

4262
01:59:38,950 --> 01:59:39,400
You know,

4263
01:59:39,400 --> 01:59:40,810
nobody wants to think about that.

4264
01:59:40,811 --> 01:59:42,820
But people can die from
a lot of dumb shit.

4265
01:59:43,330 --> 01:59:44,440
That doesn't make any sense.

4266
01:59:44,441 --> 01:59:45,640
It's available everywhere.

4267
01:59:45,790 --> 01:59:48,760
It's not w our issue is
education and honesty.

4268
01:59:48,761 --> 01:59:51,700
And if you're not honest about
something as innocuous as marijuana,

4269
01:59:52,150 --> 01:59:54,550
then why am I going to trust
you about anything else?

4270
01:59:54,700 --> 01:59:55,533
Like what?

4271
01:59:55,570 --> 01:59:56,740
Where's the dangerous shit?

4272
01:59:56,920 --> 01:59:57,161
No.

4273
01:59:57,161 --> 01:59:57,994
W Oh,

4274
01:59:58,110 --> 01:59:58,400
we're,

4275
01:59:58,400 --> 02:00:01,270
we're keeping that legal
because it's always been legal.

4276
02:00:01,390 --> 02:00:01,521
Well,

4277
02:00:01,521 --> 02:00:03,010
I'm not saying you
should make that illegal,

4278
02:00:03,011 --> 02:00:06,370
but you got to let the less dangerous
shit into this is what if the less

4279
02:00:06,371 --> 02:00:08,710
dangerous shit changes the
way people look at everything,

4280
02:00:08,830 --> 02:00:10,210
including the dangerous shit.

4281
02:00:10,270 --> 02:00:10,840
Right.

4282
02:00:10,840 --> 02:00:11,380
And that's,

4283
02:00:11,380 --> 02:00:14,110
that's a real possibility that psychedelic
software have to a lot of people that

4284
02:00:14,111 --> 02:00:15,400
are addicted to diseases.

4285
02:00:16,030 --> 02:00:18,280
A lot of people that have PTSD,

4286
02:00:18,281 --> 02:00:19,330
they're addicted to diseases,

4287
02:00:19,331 --> 02:00:21,820
have had extreme benefits
from psychedelics.

4288
02:00:23,260 --> 02:00:24,640
There's legal crash,

4289
02:00:24,670 --> 02:00:25,181
you know?

4290
02:00:25,181 --> 02:00:26,014
Uh,

4291
02:00:26,370 --> 02:00:26,630
see,

4292
02:00:26,630 --> 02:00:26,970
that's what,

4293
02:00:26,970 --> 02:00:27,920
like I told us in the beginning,

4294
02:00:27,940 --> 02:00:28,511
this was my mom,

4295
02:00:28,511 --> 02:00:28,810
he said,

4296
02:00:28,810 --> 02:00:29,020
oh,

4297
02:00:29,020 --> 02:00:30,150
so what does that mean?

4298
02:00:30,151 --> 02:00:31,310
Now I don't even understand what that is.

4299
02:00:31,390 --> 02:00:32,260
I'm ranting too much.

4300
02:00:32,290 --> 02:00:32,561
I get,

4301
02:00:32,561 --> 02:00:35,200
I just get upset and I apologize
anybody's heard this before,

4302
02:00:35,650 --> 02:00:35,951
but,

4303
02:00:35,951 --> 02:00:36,150
uh,

4304
02:00:36,150 --> 02:00:36,331
I,

4305
02:00:36,331 --> 02:00:37,001
I can't help it.

4306
02:00:37,001 --> 02:00:41,230
At certain point in time it hits
me and I'm so confused by it.

4307
02:00:41,231 --> 02:00:43,330
I feel like I need to
repeat it because it's so,

4308
02:00:43,480 --> 02:00:43,960
it's sucks.

4309
02:00:43,960 --> 02:00:45,940
It's the worst part of where we're at.

4310
02:00:45,970 --> 02:00:46,950
It's a bottleneck.

4311
02:00:47,370 --> 02:00:50,950
It's one of the worst parts is this lack
of understanding about what should and

4312
02:00:50,951 --> 02:00:52,390
shouldn't be happening to us.

4313
02:00:52,870 --> 02:00:57,400
Whether it's our government committing
to wars or whether it's the people's

4314
02:00:57,430 --> 02:01:02,320
emails being spied upon or whether
it's people being forced to not consume

4315
02:01:02,321 --> 02:01:07,321
certain things that would offer different
perspectives or people being morality.

4316
02:01:07,690 --> 02:01:08,021
Yeah.

4317
02:01:08,021 --> 02:01:08,590
People,

4318
02:01:08,590 --> 02:01:12,430
people telling you what you can and
can't do that's not hurting anybody else.

4319
02:01:13,120 --> 02:01:18,120
And I think one of the things that
I'm attracted to is altering the,

4320
02:01:19,140 --> 02:01:22,600
the current way that I think and altering
the current way that other people

4321
02:01:22,601 --> 02:01:25,060
think and giving you a perspective of,

4322
02:01:25,330 --> 02:01:27,070
of the paths that we just get on.

4323
02:01:27,071 --> 02:01:31,450
We get stuck in these fucking grooves and
it's so easy to keep making those same

4324
02:01:31,451 --> 02:01:35,710
terms over and over again whenever you
hit these very similar moments in your

4325
02:01:35,711 --> 02:01:36,480
life.

4326
02:01:36,480 --> 02:01:40,250
And that's where something like
the isolation tank is so good.

4327
02:01:40,670 --> 02:01:42,710
It's so good to just
get out of that groove.

4328
02:01:43,150 --> 02:01:43,541
You know?

4329
02:01:43,541 --> 02:01:44,290
I think,

4330
02:01:44,290 --> 02:01:44,900
you know,

4331
02:01:44,900 --> 02:01:45,490
like a log.

4332
02:01:45,490 --> 02:01:47,320
It's even when I met you
and everything like that.

4333
02:01:47,321 --> 02:01:47,890
You know,

4334
02:01:47,890 --> 02:01:48,723
I think I went to,

4335
02:01:49,000 --> 02:01:51,700
I don't know if I'd just gotten back
from Costa Rica or somebody might say,

4336
02:01:52,040 --> 02:01:52,510
I thought,

4337
02:01:52,510 --> 02:01:52,690
you know,

4338
02:01:52,690 --> 02:01:53,770
this isn't ever going to happen.

4339
02:01:53,830 --> 02:01:55,810
It's just people are never
going to get with this.

4340
02:01:56,320 --> 02:01:57,370
And then because it was just,

4341
02:01:57,371 --> 02:01:58,420
you kept trying and now,

4342
02:01:58,780 --> 02:02:03,780
but now it seems as if these people in
general have gotten up to a place where

4343
02:02:04,490 --> 02:02:07,430
they're more willing to uh,

4344
02:02:07,480 --> 02:02:10,000
experience themselves and then,

4345
02:02:10,001 --> 02:02:10,834
uh,

4346
02:02:10,960 --> 02:02:12,340
make action on that.

4347
02:02:12,950 --> 02:02:13,221
Yeah,

4348
02:02:13,221 --> 02:02:13,731
I think,

4349
02:02:13,731 --> 02:02:14,090
um,

4350
02:02:14,090 --> 02:02:14,990
I think we're,

4351
02:02:15,080 --> 02:02:16,670
people are waking up with a lot things.

4352
02:02:16,790 --> 02:02:19,430
I mean you were talking about
earlier about pilates and yoga.

4353
02:02:19,431 --> 02:02:21,590
I think people are just
waking up about their body.

4354
02:02:21,830 --> 02:02:24,680
People were really concerned about
where their food's coming from.

4355
02:02:24,681 --> 02:02:28,070
Now this is something that hadn't
really existed decades ago.

4356
02:02:28,071 --> 02:02:30,170
No one was concerned about
organics or you know,

4357
02:02:30,190 --> 02:02:30,810
when one was current,

4358
02:02:30,810 --> 02:02:34,400
concerned about GMOs products in general.

4359
02:02:34,420 --> 02:02:35,510
Is this the fact that I don't,

4360
02:02:35,511 --> 02:02:38,720
and I'm not necessarily saying that Gmos
were all bad because I don't think they

4361
02:02:38,721 --> 02:02:39,070
are.

4362
02:02:39,070 --> 02:02:39,230
Um,

4363
02:02:39,230 --> 02:02:40,810
I think there's definitely
some benefits to,

4364
02:02:40,811 --> 02:02:41,170
uh,

4365
02:02:41,170 --> 02:02:43,790
to some genetically modified organisms.

4366
02:02:43,791 --> 02:02:47,030
But I think it's important that we have
the conversations that people who are

4367
02:02:47,031 --> 02:02:52,031
really intelligent start dedicating time
and effort to researching the benefits,

4368
02:02:52,160 --> 02:02:52,851
pros and cons,

4369
02:02:52,851 --> 02:02:56,660
and then relaying that information back
to the people relaying it back to the

4370
02:02:56,661 --> 02:02:58,190
public so we know what we're in for.

4371
02:02:58,520 --> 02:03:00,740
But then money gets involved in those
things and that's what people are

4372
02:03:00,741 --> 02:03:01,574
concerned about.

4373
02:03:02,060 --> 02:03:02,730
The outcome

4374
02:03:02,730 --> 02:03:03,780
and then what you see,

4375
02:03:03,781 --> 02:03:05,910
you don't even know if it was the uh,

4376
02:03:07,040 --> 02:03:07,550
yeah,

4377
02:03:07,550 --> 02:03:11,930
but it also snaps people back and makes
them more involved in growing their own

4378
02:03:11,931 --> 02:03:13,970
food and more interested
in organic gardens.

4379
02:03:13,971 --> 02:03:16,790
And you've seen a lot of farmers' markets
that are popping up left and right.

4380
02:03:17,090 --> 02:03:18,710
I think farmer's markets are amazing.

4381
02:03:18,980 --> 02:03:19,521
You go there,

4382
02:03:19,521 --> 02:03:22,280
you get a direct connection with
the guy who actually grows the food.

4383
02:03:22,281 --> 02:03:24,680
This is the woman who
actually milks these cows.

4384
02:03:24,681 --> 02:03:27,260
This is the guy that
actually picks this salary.

4385
02:03:27,261 --> 02:03:28,100
He's right there.

4386
02:03:28,190 --> 02:03:28,681
This is their,

4387
02:03:28,681 --> 02:03:29,720
their special tomatoes.

4388
02:03:29,721 --> 02:03:30,710
They have heirloom tomatoes.

4389
02:03:30,711 --> 02:03:31,820
You get to meet these people.

4390
02:03:32,060 --> 02:03:32,271
You know,

4391
02:03:32,271 --> 02:03:35,720
I think that is that that
sort of connection is
exciting to people and that's

4392
02:03:36,020 --> 02:03:39,260
the blow back away from
a lot of the other stuff.

4393
02:03:39,261 --> 02:03:42,740
But it's all because we're getting
this information and we get to this and

4394
02:03:42,741 --> 02:03:42,980
we're,

4395
02:03:42,980 --> 02:03:45,470
we're able to make all the
decisions kind of appealing.

4396
02:03:45,770 --> 02:03:47,870
Maybe years ago you really
don't want to meet the farmer,

4397
02:03:47,871 --> 02:03:49,670
you don't really don't care
where it's tomato came from.

4398
02:03:49,940 --> 02:03:52,340
Now it's kind of like more interesting

4399
02:03:52,710 --> 02:03:53,730
to understand,

4400
02:03:53,731 --> 02:03:54,031
you know,

4401
02:03:54,031 --> 02:03:54,241
the,

4402
02:03:54,241 --> 02:03:54,960
uh,

4403
02:03:54,960 --> 02:03:55,920
the orientation,

4404
02:03:55,921 --> 02:03:56,221
you know,

4405
02:03:56,221 --> 02:03:56,380
how,

4406
02:03:56,380 --> 02:03:58,470
how it's happening or you know,

4407
02:03:58,530 --> 02:03:59,610
what's going on.

4408
02:03:59,700 --> 02:04:00,470
People are more,

4409
02:04:00,470 --> 02:04:03,040
more like the spray on them
that they're the roundup.

4410
02:04:03,050 --> 02:04:03,980
And then like I said,

4411
02:04:04,090 --> 02:04:04,923
if you know,

4412
02:04:05,160 --> 02:04:05,940
people back,

4413
02:04:05,940 --> 02:04:06,421
they just,

4414
02:04:06,421 --> 02:04:08,640
stuff just happened and
they really weren't,

4415
02:04:08,850 --> 02:04:09,331
you know,

4416
02:04:09,331 --> 02:04:10,164
uh,

4417
02:04:10,730 --> 02:04:11,310
I don't know.

4418
02:04:11,310 --> 02:04:11,850
There were certain,

4419
02:04:11,850 --> 02:04:15,160
there was just caught up in whatever was
going on because they didn't have a way

4420
02:04:15,161 --> 02:04:16,150
of communicating about it.

4421
02:04:16,151 --> 02:04:17,560
Like we have to the Internet,

4422
02:04:17,561 --> 02:04:17,921
really.

4423
02:04:17,921 --> 02:04:18,240
Someone,

4424
02:04:18,240 --> 02:04:18,520
yeah,

4425
02:04:18,520 --> 02:04:22,120
someone could put up a blog about
here's the dangers of this particular

4426
02:04:22,121 --> 02:04:23,740
pesticide on your tomatoes.

4427
02:04:24,010 --> 02:04:25,330
And then you hear about that and you go,

4428
02:04:25,331 --> 02:04:25,800
wow,

4429
02:04:25,800 --> 02:04:28,180
that that is not good and that's real.

4430
02:04:28,181 --> 02:04:29,830
The pesticides kill bugs.

4431
02:04:30,040 --> 02:04:30,940
Why do they kill bugs?

4432
02:04:30,941 --> 02:04:32,080
Cause they're fucking poison.

4433
02:04:32,350 --> 02:04:32,651
Why?

4434
02:04:32,651 --> 02:04:34,180
Why those plants not getting poisoned?

4435
02:04:34,181 --> 02:04:34,691
Well they are,

4436
02:04:34,691 --> 02:04:35,890
but just not enough to kill him.

4437
02:04:36,140 --> 02:04:36,973
They figured out a way,

4438
02:04:37,080 --> 02:04:37,640
make a whole,

4439
02:04:37,640 --> 02:04:38,130
it's one

4440
02:04:38,130 --> 02:04:38,990
day and I'm in there.

4441
02:04:39,010 --> 02:04:41,040
This guy was in there spraying this stuff,

4442
02:04:41,041 --> 02:04:41,700
you know,

4443
02:04:41,700 --> 02:04:42,121
I said to him,

4444
02:04:42,121 --> 02:04:42,301
I said,

4445
02:04:42,301 --> 02:04:42,421
hey,

4446
02:04:42,421 --> 02:04:45,930
what's this conventional
grown or a organically grown?

4447
02:04:45,931 --> 02:04:46,121
What,

4448
02:04:46,121 --> 02:04:46,800
what?

4449
02:04:46,800 --> 02:04:47,580
What does that mean?

4450
02:04:47,580 --> 02:04:47,941
He goes,

4451
02:04:47,941 --> 02:04:48,301
well,

4452
02:04:48,301 --> 02:04:48,571
he goes,

4453
02:04:48,571 --> 02:04:48,840
uh,

4454
02:04:48,840 --> 02:04:49,920
I guess if it's organic,

4455
02:04:49,921 --> 02:04:51,000
it's done without poison.

4456
02:04:51,770 --> 02:04:52,340
And I said,

4457
02:04:52,340 --> 02:04:53,050
Huh,

4458
02:04:53,050 --> 02:04:53,883
all right.

4459
02:04:53,970 --> 02:04:55,140
So the conventional and means,

4460
02:04:55,141 --> 02:04:56,010
is that like a with it a,

4461
02:04:56,011 --> 02:04:57,750
a poisonous substance in order to,

4462
02:04:57,780 --> 02:04:58,030
uh,

4463
02:04:58,030 --> 02:04:58,351
okay,

4464
02:04:58,351 --> 02:05:01,680
let's find out about that because
I've always wanted to know what is the

4465
02:05:01,681 --> 02:05:03,840
official description,

4466
02:05:04,020 --> 02:05:05,850
what is the official
definition of organic?

4467
02:05:05,910 --> 02:05:06,201
Like I said,

4468
02:05:06,201 --> 02:05:08,280
I got this from the clean
up food and I thought,

4469
02:05:08,290 --> 02:05:09,123
hey,

4470
02:05:09,390 --> 02:05:10,590
he didn't seem to be a scientist.

4471
02:05:10,591 --> 02:05:12,030
But that seems to make a lot of sense.

4472
02:05:12,510 --> 02:05:13,980
Let's look into Wikipedia.

4473
02:05:14,010 --> 02:05:15,400
This is organic foods

4474
02:05:15,590 --> 02:05:18,530
are produced using methods
of organic farming.

4475
02:05:18,800 --> 02:05:23,800
Currently Baba Baba Baba Baba requires
countries require producers tubes to

4476
02:05:24,680 --> 02:05:28,970
obtain special certification or to to
market food as organic within their

4477
02:05:29,270 --> 02:05:30,103
borders.

4478
02:05:30,130 --> 02:05:30,320
Uh,

4479
02:05:30,320 --> 02:05:31,670
the context of these regulations,

4480
02:05:31,671 --> 02:05:36,380
organic food is food produced in a way
that complies with organic standards that

4481
02:05:36,381 --> 02:05:37,280
keeps saying nothing here.

4482
02:05:37,310 --> 02:05:38,051
What's organic there?

4483
02:05:38,051 --> 02:05:38,360
Wake up,

4484
02:05:38,360 --> 02:05:38,511
back,

4485
02:05:38,511 --> 02:05:38,840
hold on.

4486
02:05:38,840 --> 02:05:42,470
Janica while the organic standard
is defined differently in different

4487
02:05:42,471 --> 02:05:43,304
jurisdictions.

4488
02:05:43,310 --> 02:05:43,700
Oh,

4489
02:05:43,700 --> 02:05:44,300
okay.

4490
02:05:44,300 --> 02:05:44,931
In general,

4491
02:05:44,931 --> 02:05:48,710
organic farming response
to site specifics,

4492
02:05:48,740 --> 02:05:52,430
farming and crop conditions
by integrating cultural,

4493
02:05:52,431 --> 02:05:57,431
biological and mechanical practices
that foster cycling of resources promote

4494
02:05:58,161 --> 02:06:01,010
ecological balance and
concern biodiversity.

4495
02:06:01,011 --> 02:06:01,844
I didn't know that.

4496
02:06:01,850 --> 02:06:02,151
Okay.

4497
02:06:02,151 --> 02:06:05,510
Synthetic pesticides and chemical
fertilizers are not allowed,

4498
02:06:05,990 --> 02:06:10,520
although certain organically approved
pesticides may be used under limited

4499
02:06:10,521 --> 02:06:11,480
conditions in general,

4500
02:06:11,481 --> 02:06:15,110
organic foods are not
processed using irradiation,

4501
02:06:15,260 --> 02:06:18,440
industrial solvents or
chemical food additives.

4502
02:06:19,250 --> 02:06:20,360
I didn't know the first part though.

4503
02:06:20,361 --> 02:06:23,000
I didn't know it was defined by a cycling.

4504
02:06:23,360 --> 02:06:23,661
Uh,

4505
02:06:23,661 --> 02:06:26,270
the conditions cycling of re

4506
02:06:26,530 --> 02:06:27,280
resources,

4507
02:06:27,280 --> 02:06:28,120
what they need to do,

4508
02:06:30,560 --> 02:06:32,920
the nutrients in the soil there.

4509
02:06:33,150 --> 02:06:33,511
Yeah,

4510
02:06:33,511 --> 02:06:33,791
that's,

4511
02:06:33,791 --> 02:06:35,220
that's one of the most difficult things.

4512
02:06:35,280 --> 02:06:38,190
Representation I guess is a crop rotation.

4513
02:06:38,191 --> 02:06:38,851
And also,

4514
02:06:38,851 --> 02:06:39,121
you know,

4515
02:06:39,121 --> 02:06:44,070
when you have enormous chunks of land
that are just dedicated entirely to corn

4516
02:06:44,071 --> 02:06:45,690
or entirely to this are entirely to that.

4517
02:06:45,990 --> 02:06:46,470
You know,

4518
02:06:46,470 --> 02:06:49,800
a lot of times those farmlands become
minerally deficient and they have to

4519
02:06:49,801 --> 02:06:52,440
actually add minerals to
the ground in order to,

4520
02:06:52,441 --> 02:06:53,100
uh,

4521
02:06:53,100 --> 02:06:55,020
I think they would use in the old days,

4522
02:06:55,021 --> 02:06:57,780
like they would use like fish and stuff
like that to try to replenish their

4523
02:06:57,781 --> 02:06:59,820
garden fishes apparently
really good for that.

4524
02:07:00,390 --> 02:07:01,223
But uh,

4525
02:07:01,260 --> 02:07:01,740
yeah,

4526
02:07:01,740 --> 02:07:02,573
the,

4527
02:07:02,610 --> 02:07:03,540
the idea that,

4528
02:07:03,840 --> 02:07:06,540
that's a weird thing to want
something to be organic.

4529
02:07:06,630 --> 02:07:08,490
I think you gotta you gotta ask for that.

4530
02:07:08,491 --> 02:07:08,731
It's like,

4531
02:07:08,731 --> 02:07:10,800
how did you allow people
to pour poison on,

4532
02:07:10,810 --> 02:07:11,643
on food?

4533
02:07:11,850 --> 02:07:13,050
How'd you allow people to grow?

4534
02:07:13,080 --> 02:07:13,620
I mean,

4535
02:07:13,620 --> 02:07:15,390
isn't there another way
to deal with those bugs?

4536
02:07:15,510 --> 02:07:19,140
Can you like hire someone to clean the
bugs off and you have to fucking spray

4537
02:07:19,470 --> 02:07:20,670
death from the sky?

4538
02:07:20,880 --> 02:07:21,900
It sounds ridiculous.

4539
02:07:21,901 --> 02:07:22,540
Like my,

4540
02:07:22,540 --> 02:07:24,150
my version of it sounds ridiculous.

4541
02:07:24,360 --> 02:07:25,230
Birds and animals.

4542
02:07:26,400 --> 02:07:28,260
Birds eat all the corn too though,

4543
02:07:28,261 --> 02:07:29,094
don't they?

4544
02:07:30,210 --> 02:07:30,870
I don't know.

4545
02:07:30,870 --> 02:07:31,703
Animals do.

4546
02:07:32,650 --> 02:07:33,070
I Dunno.

4547
02:07:33,070 --> 02:07:33,903
He'd say,

4548
02:07:34,160 --> 02:07:34,350
well,

4549
02:07:34,350 --> 02:07:34,591
you know,

4550
02:07:34,591 --> 02:07:36,700
I was watching some show the
other day on the history channel.

4551
02:07:36,760 --> 02:07:37,900
It was actually about history,

4552
02:07:37,930 --> 02:07:40,450
which is hilarious because you
watch the fucking history channel.

4553
02:07:40,451 --> 02:07:42,250
When was the last time you
saw some shit about history?

4554
02:07:42,610 --> 02:07:43,270
Right?

4555
02:07:43,270 --> 02:07:43,751
Never.

4556
02:07:43,751 --> 02:07:47,050
It's always like alligator
farmers or something fucked up.

4557
02:07:47,350 --> 02:07:48,970
But it was a about locusts.

4558
02:07:49,180 --> 02:07:49,931
It was all about,

4559
02:07:49,931 --> 02:07:50,320
um,

4560
02:07:50,320 --> 02:07:51,670
the early 18 hundreds.

4561
02:07:51,671 --> 02:07:56,410
And these people were like a traveling
across the United States setting up farms

4562
02:07:56,411 --> 02:08:00,010
and stuff and the locus hit these
people's farms and they had to send in the

4563
02:08:00,011 --> 02:08:02,410
army to bring these
people food mean these,

4564
02:08:02,470 --> 02:08:03,430
these grasshoppers.

4565
02:08:03,430 --> 02:08:05,260
He's locusts were just,

4566
02:08:05,261 --> 02:08:07,480
they filled the sky for hours.

4567
02:08:07,570 --> 02:08:08,620
Like for hours and hours.

4568
02:08:08,621 --> 02:08:12,040
They filled the sky and just flew
by and just destroyed everything.

4569
02:08:12,220 --> 02:08:13,870
Just tore through people's crops.

4570
02:08:14,200 --> 02:08:15,460
And they were talking about how big,

4571
02:08:15,461 --> 02:08:16,111
it must've been the,

4572
02:08:16,111 --> 02:08:17,840
the millions and millions of,

4573
02:08:17,841 --> 02:08:19,960
of bugs that must've been in the air.

4574
02:08:20,230 --> 02:08:21,063
Yeah.

4575
02:08:21,710 --> 02:08:22,480
For the corn though,

4576
02:08:22,480 --> 02:08:23,500
they went straight for crops.

4577
02:08:23,501 --> 02:08:25,330
They just buzz through
and killed everything.

4578
02:08:25,480 --> 02:08:28,330
They said you would see it as
a storm cloud coming at you.

4579
02:08:28,720 --> 02:08:31,300
And then as you look down or looked up,

4580
02:08:31,301 --> 02:08:31,630
rather,

4581
02:08:31,630 --> 02:08:34,810
you would realize somewhere along the
line to there wasn't a cloud that was a

4582
02:08:34,811 --> 02:08:35,391
storm.

4583
02:08:35,391 --> 02:08:35,851
It was cloud.

4584
02:08:35,851 --> 02:08:36,130
Right.

4585
02:08:36,130 --> 02:08:36,611
Bugs.

4586
02:08:36,611 --> 02:08:38,290
Do they make a quickie sound or something?

4587
02:08:38,310 --> 02:08:38,740
Pull up,

4588
02:08:38,740 --> 02:08:40,180
pull up video of locusts.

4589
02:08:40,210 --> 02:08:42,760
Pull up some locust video from the,

4590
02:08:42,790 --> 02:08:43,623
you know,

4591
02:08:43,930 --> 02:08:44,620
whenever I'm like,

4592
02:08:44,620 --> 02:08:46,120
it's got a clicky sound when it's flying.

4593
02:08:46,240 --> 02:08:46,631
I don't know.

4594
02:08:46,631 --> 02:08:47,770
I never been around locus.

4595
02:08:47,770 --> 02:08:50,620
I've been around grasshoppers
and apparently they're in
the grasshopper family.

4596
02:08:50,621 --> 02:08:51,130
Yeah.

4597
02:08:51,130 --> 02:08:52,570
Where's this locus shallows.

4598
02:08:52,571 --> 02:08:53,530
That's so disgusting.

4599
02:08:53,531 --> 02:08:56,700
You would just like go outside and you'll
just see this empty shell of what it

4600
02:08:56,710 --> 02:08:58,090
looks exactly like a locust.

4601
02:08:58,150 --> 02:08:58,680
Oh yeah.

4602
02:08:58,680 --> 02:08:59,530
Like the shell of it.

4603
02:08:59,830 --> 02:09:01,180
Just the outside of those things.

4604
02:09:01,480 --> 02:09:02,200
But if you've,

4605
02:09:02,200 --> 02:09:03,033
um,

4606
02:09:03,520 --> 02:09:05,950
if you've ever heard of
like biblical predictions,

4607
02:09:05,951 --> 02:09:10,870
locus was involved in biblical
predictions of apocalyptic conditions.

4608
02:09:10,871 --> 02:09:11,051
You know,

4609
02:09:11,051 --> 02:09:13,690
they always talked about
locus locus taking the sky.

4610
02:09:13,720 --> 02:09:13,921
Yeah.

4611
02:09:13,921 --> 02:09:16,720
Like when you think about
like old horror movies,

4612
02:09:16,721 --> 02:09:16,961
you know,

4613
02:09:16,961 --> 02:09:18,940
like demonic possession things.

4614
02:09:19,030 --> 02:09:21,190
A plague of locusts
hit Egypt this weekend,

4615
02:09:21,400 --> 02:09:24,790
causing some citizens to burn
tires and attempt to ward them off.

4616
02:09:25,130 --> 02:09:25,841
That's when you know,

4617
02:09:25,841 --> 02:09:27,160
shit gets ugly.

4618
02:09:27,370 --> 02:09:28,270
30 tires,

4619
02:09:28,300 --> 02:09:29,350
burn tires,

4620
02:09:29,680 --> 02:09:33,790
swarm of locusts were spotted in several
districts of Cairo on Saturday as they

4621
02:09:33,791 --> 02:09:36,670
invaded the Giza area of
the Middle Eastern nations.

4622
02:09:36,760 --> 02:09:36,911
Oh,

4623
02:09:36,911 --> 02:09:37,601
let's see this shit.

4624
02:09:37,601 --> 02:09:38,081
I can't wait.

4625
02:09:38,081 --> 02:09:39,340
It's like a previous for a movie.

4626
02:09:39,550 --> 02:09:39,881
What is it?

4627
02:09:39,881 --> 02:09:40,750
Star Wars Bitch.

4628
02:09:41,290 --> 02:09:42,840
30 million and sec.

4629
02:09:43,330 --> 02:09:44,770
Once upon a time in a galaxy far,

4630
02:09:44,771 --> 02:09:45,604
far away.

4631
02:09:46,900 --> 02:09:47,770
Let's see this shit.

4632
02:09:48,870 --> 02:09:50,140
I want to see them invade.

4633
02:09:52,390 --> 02:09:54,670
I don't say shit or they are,

4634
02:09:54,730 --> 02:09:55,563
that's it.

4635
02:09:55,960 --> 02:09:56,793
Other comment.

4636
02:09:57,490 --> 02:09:59,120
It's not going to be pretty okay.

4637
02:09:59,320 --> 02:10:00,610
This is not good film.

4638
02:10:00,970 --> 02:10:01,803
This is terrible.

4639
02:10:03,120 --> 02:10:03,320
Ah,

4640
02:10:03,320 --> 02:10:03,910
yes.

4641
02:10:03,910 --> 02:10:05,620
We're not seeing it and good HD.

4642
02:10:05,740 --> 02:10:06,573
That's what it is.

4643
02:10:07,090 --> 02:10:10,630
We're seeing it in this shitty
youtube thing via our television,

4644
02:10:10,930 --> 02:10:11,590
but yeah.

4645
02:10:11,590 --> 02:10:12,160
Wow.

4646
02:10:12,160 --> 02:10:12,850
Wow.

4647
02:10:12,850 --> 02:10:14,350
That's a lot of God damn bugs.

4648
02:10:14,560 --> 02:10:15,490
There's the noise too.

4649
02:10:17,260 --> 02:10:18,093
Whoa.

4650
02:10:18,660 --> 02:10:19,590
That's so weird.

4651
02:10:19,880 --> 02:10:21,210
They like the ultimate gang

4652
02:10:24,140 --> 02:10:29,140
and they fly in this huge formation
and just cause massive destruction and

4653
02:10:30,711 --> 02:10:31,610
apparently they've done it.

4654
02:10:31,910 --> 02:10:32,180
Yeah.

4655
02:10:32,180 --> 02:10:34,280
Since the beginning of we occasionally

4656
02:10:34,280 --> 02:10:35,860
get together what's in the Bible,

4657
02:10:37,470 --> 02:10:38,110
although kiss,

4658
02:10:38,110 --> 02:10:38,841
they come in the,

4659
02:10:38,841 --> 02:10:39,090
uh,

4660
02:10:39,090 --> 02:10:42,210
that's one of the things that
when it signs a gay people,

4661
02:10:42,211 --> 02:10:42,410
but

4662
02:10:42,410 --> 02:10:43,243
fucking each other.

4663
02:10:44,090 --> 02:10:44,421
Whoa,

4664
02:10:44,421 --> 02:10:45,254
look at that.

4665
02:10:45,380 --> 02:10:45,920
Oh boy.

4666
02:10:45,920 --> 02:10:46,790
This isn't the Congo.

4667
02:10:46,810 --> 02:10:47,643
I would have said,

4668
02:10:49,250 --> 02:10:50,083
Whoa,

4669
02:10:50,840 --> 02:10:51,673
look at that.

4670
02:10:52,280 --> 02:10:53,113
Oh my God.

4671
02:10:59,490 --> 02:11:00,321
Fuck up bitch.

4672
02:11:00,321 --> 02:11:01,250
Shut your mouth.

4673
02:11:01,730 --> 02:11:02,690
Jesus Christ.

4674
02:11:06,620 --> 02:11:07,490
How old is that kid?

4675
02:11:09,620 --> 02:11:10,371
She's over eight.

4676
02:11:10,371 --> 02:11:10,641
Told her,

4677
02:11:10,641 --> 02:11:11,474
shut her whole.

4678
02:11:17,110 --> 02:11:18,170
Oh my God,

4679
02:11:18,171 --> 02:11:22,160
this kid with the ears shut this kid down.

4680
02:11:22,550 --> 02:11:23,383
That's a lot of

4681
02:11:25,950 --> 02:11:26,830
that is incredible.

4682
02:11:26,870 --> 02:11:28,060
You know what I might be screaming like,

4683
02:11:28,510 --> 02:11:29,343
right,

4684
02:11:30,250 --> 02:11:31,310
I'll be right there with the kid,

4685
02:11:31,880 --> 02:11:33,200
which being on a motorcycle,

4686
02:11:33,201 --> 02:11:35,450
just trying to get home and
you're just like spot spot spot.

4687
02:11:35,510 --> 02:11:35,931
And this said,

4688
02:11:35,931 --> 02:11:36,501
the Congo,

4689
02:11:36,501 --> 02:11:37,370
this was in the Congo.

4690
02:11:40,570 --> 02:11:41,650
So many of them,

4691
02:11:44,320 --> 02:11:45,590
Mommy's not helping you too.

4692
02:11:45,610 --> 02:11:46,443
What's she gonna do?

4693
02:11:47,860 --> 02:11:49,730
Fucking goddamn storm.

4694
02:11:49,810 --> 02:11:51,940
You should be so psyched
that people invented cars.

4695
02:11:52,870 --> 02:11:54,040
That's how you should feel right now.

4696
02:11:54,041 --> 02:11:57,940
You just feel like people
are awesome cars vented

4697
02:11:57,940 --> 02:11:59,100
to protect us from locus.

4698
02:11:59,570 --> 02:12:00,640
That's what you should be thinking.

4699
02:12:00,880 --> 02:12:01,450
She'd be like,

4700
02:12:01,450 --> 02:12:01,691
oh,

4701
02:12:01,691 --> 02:12:02,524
that's amazing.

4702
02:12:02,680 --> 02:12:03,640
Thank God they invested.

4703
02:12:03,760 --> 02:12:07,210
Pesticides are sprayed to the
sky and knock those fuckers dead.

4704
02:12:08,920 --> 02:12:11,140
Can they do anything when,

4705
02:12:11,170 --> 02:12:12,820
when locusts come do you think?

4706
02:12:12,821 --> 02:12:14,380
Can they like throw nets up or anything?

4707
02:12:16,720 --> 02:12:16,871
Yeah.

4708
02:12:16,871 --> 02:12:17,290
What did they,

4709
02:12:17,290 --> 02:12:18,670
how did they stop locusts?

4710
02:12:18,790 --> 02:12:19,031
You know,

4711
02:12:19,031 --> 02:12:19,840
you do,

4712
02:12:19,840 --> 02:12:24,160
you get like a windmill with like a very
large paddle and you just put in the

4713
02:12:24,161 --> 02:12:24,941
center of the town.

4714
02:12:24,941 --> 02:12:25,774
Just Swat.

4715
02:12:26,770 --> 02:12:30,520
Just smack them right in the face as
they come in and just kill them all.

4716
02:12:30,521 --> 02:12:34,300
Eventually put a sheet down
below so when you chop them up,

4717
02:12:34,301 --> 02:12:36,070
that's a good protein powder there.

4718
02:12:36,250 --> 02:12:36,971
It's very good for you.

4719
02:12:36,971 --> 02:12:37,320
Right?

4720
02:12:37,320 --> 02:12:38,410
It's protein powder.

4721
02:12:38,500 --> 02:12:41,440
A lot of people eat bugs and other parts
of the other parts of the world where

4722
02:12:41,441 --> 02:12:43,450
they have to and the tasty,

4723
02:12:43,840 --> 02:12:45,550
the locust crunchy.

4724
02:12:45,870 --> 02:12:47,170
You actually eat them?

4725
02:12:47,410 --> 02:12:48,330
Well no,

4726
02:12:48,400 --> 02:12:49,630
but what are you saying crash.

4727
02:12:49,910 --> 02:12:50,743
Remember these gifts?

4728
02:12:50,770 --> 02:12:51,281
It's all gone.

4729
02:12:51,281 --> 02:12:52,930
Rock candies.

4730
02:12:52,990 --> 02:12:53,231
Yeah.

4731
02:12:53,231 --> 02:12:54,160
I never got a chart.

4732
02:12:54,300 --> 02:12:55,133
Grasshopper.

4733
02:12:55,190 --> 02:12:56,023
Grasshopper.

4734
02:12:56,060 --> 02:12:57,540
So no,

4735
02:12:57,590 --> 02:12:58,331
I'd never tried it,

4736
02:12:58,331 --> 02:13:00,510
but they used to sell that
shit at urban outfitters.

4737
02:13:00,520 --> 02:13:01,300
Actually.

4738
02:13:01,300 --> 02:13:02,630
Urban outfitters sells locust.

4739
02:13:02,631 --> 02:13:02,711
Yeah.

4740
02:13:02,711 --> 02:13:04,180
They said like these weird bugs,

4741
02:13:04,181 --> 02:13:07,210
they can just get chocolate and
you answered their chocolate ants,

4742
02:13:07,240 --> 02:13:08,110
caterpillars.

4743
02:13:08,170 --> 02:13:10,060
The thing about chocolate answers,

4744
02:13:10,510 --> 02:13:11,001
you know they,

4745
02:13:11,001 --> 02:13:12,070
they're actually good for you.

4746
02:13:12,071 --> 02:13:13,480
Like answer actually good for you.

4747
02:13:13,510 --> 02:13:16,380
Like if as long as you're not
poisoning ads when you're eating ants,

4748
02:13:16,450 --> 02:13:17,740
actually a good source of protein,

4749
02:13:17,830 --> 02:13:19,900
so it was a good source of
protein covered in chocolate.

4750
02:13:19,901 --> 02:13:20,711
You kind of feel like,

4751
02:13:20,711 --> 02:13:21,370
man,

4752
02:13:21,370 --> 02:13:22,570
I'm not really eating candy,

4753
02:13:23,080 --> 02:13:24,160
but he's still eating candy.

4754
02:13:24,320 --> 02:13:27,790
I think we'd put the windmill up
after they hit the corn field.

4755
02:13:28,060 --> 02:13:29,350
Then after all full of corn,

4756
02:13:29,351 --> 02:13:29,741
then we,

4757
02:13:29,741 --> 02:13:32,070
then we make them into the powder and then

4758
02:13:32,070 --> 02:13:33,430
they have more nutritional value.

4759
02:13:33,520 --> 02:13:33,641
Well,

4760
02:13:33,641 --> 02:13:35,140
I think even if you put the windmill up,

4761
02:13:35,141 --> 02:13:37,090
you'd only kill the ones
that are near the windmill.

4762
02:13:37,091 --> 02:13:39,730
The ones underneath the windmill that
they're like your height and my height.

4763
02:13:39,760 --> 02:13:41,680
It's they fly like an inch off the ground.

4764
02:13:41,681 --> 02:13:43,090
Those fuckers like they're everywhere.

4765
02:13:43,440 --> 02:13:44,500
Kamikazes yeah,

4766
02:13:44,501 --> 02:13:45,430
there's so many of them.

4767
02:13:45,431 --> 02:13:46,270
There's no room.

4768
02:13:46,271 --> 02:13:48,210
They can't all just be in the sky happen.

4769
02:13:48,340 --> 02:13:49,390
How do they all get born?

4770
02:13:49,420 --> 02:13:50,231
That's a good question.

4771
02:13:50,231 --> 02:13:52,990
I think they fuck just to
all of those at one time.

4772
02:13:52,991 --> 02:13:53,800
It's like I do,

4773
02:13:53,800 --> 02:13:55,060
it's called a cluster fuck.

4774
02:13:57,610 --> 02:13:58,750
The biblical cluster.

4775
02:13:58,751 --> 02:13:59,230
Fuck,

4776
02:13:59,230 --> 02:14:00,063
Huh?

4777
02:14:00,130 --> 02:14:00,640
Yeah.

4778
02:14:00,640 --> 02:14:01,473
Wow.

4779
02:14:01,780 --> 02:14:02,380
We're lucky.

4780
02:14:02,380 --> 02:14:03,041
We're very lucky.

4781
02:14:03,041 --> 02:14:04,090
Especially here in California.

4782
02:14:04,091 --> 02:14:05,290
We don't need to have mosquitoes.

4783
02:14:05,291 --> 02:14:06,080
Dude.

4784
02:14:06,080 --> 02:14:07,900
You know I thought about
that when I was up in Canada.

4785
02:14:07,901 --> 02:14:08,640
We have to,

4786
02:14:08,640 --> 02:14:10,030
they have a thing called Thermacell.

4787
02:14:10,031 --> 02:14:11,140
You ever heard of a Thermacell?

4788
02:14:11,890 --> 02:14:12,551
It's weird.

4789
02:14:12,551 --> 02:14:16,210
It's like got a compartment in it that
you put like a a chemical and then you

4790
02:14:16,211 --> 02:14:21,211
turn these suckers on and then you put
it down and this like mist comes out and

4791
02:14:21,401 --> 02:14:22,540
you can't smell it at all,

4792
02:14:22,541 --> 02:14:24,580
but the mosquitoes avoid
you like the plague.

4793
02:14:24,850 --> 02:14:29,850
So we would sit down outside in the
woods and it was really mosquito ridden.

4794
02:14:29,950 --> 02:14:31,900
Like immediately the mosquitoes
come near and you're like,

4795
02:14:31,901 --> 02:14:32,441
Holy Shit,

4796
02:14:32,441 --> 02:14:33,280
I don't think I can do this.

4797
02:14:33,510 --> 02:14:34,360
Like this is rough.

4798
02:14:34,420 --> 02:14:34,511
I,

4799
02:14:34,511 --> 02:14:36,130
they were all over the world.

4800
02:14:36,490 --> 02:14:38,080
You put this Thermacell thing down,

4801
02:14:38,170 --> 02:14:38,530
boom.

4802
02:14:38,530 --> 02:14:39,910
10 minutes later they're gone.

4803
02:14:40,060 --> 02:14:43,990
Before that I got like a mask on ski mask
and a hat and I got fucking gloves on.

4804
02:14:43,991 --> 02:14:44,201
I'm like,

4805
02:14:44,201 --> 02:14:44,441
cheese.

4806
02:14:44,441 --> 02:14:45,730
And they're trying to
bite me through my glove.

4807
02:14:45,731 --> 02:14:46,540
Like you fuckers,

4808
02:14:46,540 --> 02:14:47,373
they're everywhere.

4809
02:14:47,500 --> 02:14:48,550
Participant in Thermacell,

4810
02:14:48,551 --> 02:14:49,570
you keep it on for 10 minutes.

4811
02:14:49,630 --> 02:14:50,740
There's no mosquitoes.

4812
02:14:50,830 --> 02:14:51,330
Boom.

4813
02:14:51,330 --> 02:14:52,270
You know what sucks is those,

4814
02:14:52,271 --> 02:14:52,450
uh,

4815
02:14:52,450 --> 02:14:56,170
I don't know if they haven't been in Los
Angeles is the Japanese beetles that in

4816
02:14:56,171 --> 02:14:59,950
the Midwest we used to get
so many Japanese beetles
that we'd have to have these

4817
02:14:59,951 --> 02:15:04,390
bags that you put in your front and back
yard where the beetles will come in and

4818
02:15:04,391 --> 02:15:05,470
get collected in there.

4819
02:15:05,600 --> 02:15:08,410
You're just like every week you
just have this humongous bag.

4820
02:15:08,650 --> 02:15:10,600
Just sweaty bugs.

4821
02:15:10,760 --> 02:15:12,370
We were trapping to throw it out.

4822
02:15:12,470 --> 02:15:12,790
Yeah.

4823
02:15:12,790 --> 02:15:13,630
It's like a beetle.

4824
02:15:13,631 --> 02:15:14,464
A hotel.

4825
02:15:14,490 --> 02:15:14,621
Yeah.

4826
02:15:14,621 --> 02:15:15,454
It's like a beetle traps.

4827
02:15:15,500 --> 02:15:16,131
Just bags.

4828
02:15:16,131 --> 02:15:16,964
Beatles.

4829
02:15:17,330 --> 02:15:18,163
Wow.

4830
02:15:18,170 --> 02:15:21,470
I saw some video the other day of
another thing we don't have to deal with.

4831
02:15:21,490 --> 02:15:23,540
There was a hailstorm somewhere that it,

4832
02:15:23,541 --> 02:15:25,280
fuck this guy's car up.

4833
02:15:25,460 --> 02:15:28,820
This guy's entire car was
like covered in like dense,

4834
02:15:28,821 --> 02:15:29,361
like hall.

4835
02:15:29,361 --> 02:15:33,230
Where as if it had like a really bad
case of chicken pox and script off all of

4836
02:15:33,231 --> 02:15:34,064
its scabs.

4837
02:15:34,250 --> 02:15:37,730
Like the whole car was just
parked in windows are broken.

4838
02:15:37,980 --> 02:15:38,780
They'll list.

4839
02:15:38,780 --> 02:15:39,890
The hail was so big.

4840
02:15:39,891 --> 02:15:41,030
It's shattered the windshield.

4841
02:15:41,170 --> 02:15:41,340
Yeah.

4842
02:15:41,340 --> 02:15:42,650
It's one of those hits you in the head.

4843
02:15:43,130 --> 02:15:43,731
Your Dad.

4844
02:15:43,731 --> 02:15:45,160
Many people die from hail every year.

4845
02:15:45,510 --> 02:15:46,300
More than Kelsey.

4846
02:15:46,300 --> 02:15:47,780
Lot 10 more than coconuts.

4847
02:15:47,781 --> 02:15:48,290
For Real.

4848
02:15:48,290 --> 02:15:48,381
Oh,

4849
02:15:48,381 --> 02:15:48,741
I don't know.

4850
02:15:48,741 --> 02:15:49,460
I know some people,

4851
02:15:49,460 --> 02:15:51,880
they say they die from
coconuts and how excited I got.

4852
02:15:52,170 --> 02:15:52,510
Well,

4853
02:15:52,510 --> 02:15:52,900
yeah,

4854
02:15:52,900 --> 02:15:54,940
hundred 50 people die
every year from coconuts.

4855
02:15:55,000 --> 02:15:55,480
Really?

4856
02:15:55,480 --> 02:15:56,313
Yup.

4857
02:15:56,530 --> 02:15:56,771
Okay.

4858
02:15:56,771 --> 02:15:57,970
How many people die for a year?

4859
02:15:58,690 --> 02:15:59,320
About Hale?

4860
02:15:59,320 --> 02:16:00,640
How many would you say if the gas

4861
02:16:01,490 --> 02:16:05,470
5,400 die before I left
for California in my house,

4862
02:16:05,471 --> 02:16:07,480
got the golf sized hail,

4863
02:16:07,750 --> 02:16:10,030
the whole Columbus area
and everybody's car.

4864
02:16:10,031 --> 02:16:10,660
It got ruined.

4865
02:16:10,660 --> 02:16:11,950
Everybody's house was ruined.

4866
02:16:11,951 --> 02:16:15,820
People would moved to Columbus just
to be insurance agents for like a year

4867
02:16:15,940 --> 02:16:16,960
because everyone's house,

4868
02:16:17,020 --> 02:16:17,710
we're fucked.

4869
02:16:17,710 --> 02:16:19,240
And so everyone got new cars.

4870
02:16:19,241 --> 02:16:22,060
Like it was so weird that like the whole
city almost got new cars at the same

4871
02:16:22,061 --> 02:16:22,470
time.

4872
02:16:22,470 --> 02:16:23,101
Oh my God.

4873
02:16:23,101 --> 02:16:24,510
There's a hailstorm,

4874
02:16:24,640 --> 02:16:29,640
a hailstone in 1928
that weighed 1.5 pounds.

4875
02:16:30,760 --> 02:16:31,150
What is it?

4876
02:16:31,150 --> 02:16:31,983
How big is that?

4877
02:16:32,380 --> 02:16:34,150
It is seven inches.

4878
02:16:34,600 --> 02:16:35,680
Wow.

4879
02:16:36,340 --> 02:16:41,320
Any weighed 1.5 pounds and
it came from the fucking sky.

4880
02:16:41,770 --> 02:16:45,910
It's believed to be the largest
known in the u s at the time,

4881
02:16:46,810 --> 02:16:47,950
man,

4882
02:16:48,020 --> 02:16:50,350
they captured that bad boy seven inches.

4883
02:16:50,880 --> 02:16:51,250
Oh my God.

4884
02:16:51,250 --> 02:16:51,491
Okay.

4885
02:16:51,491 --> 02:16:56,260
There's another one that in
1970 there was 1.67 pounds,

4886
02:16:56,560 --> 02:16:57,790
so it was even bigger.

4887
02:16:58,300 --> 02:16:59,440
Jesus Christ,

4888
02:17:01,010 --> 02:17:01,210
uh,

4889
02:17:01,210 --> 02:17:06,210
Labor Day thunderstorm costs $342 million
worth of insurance damage in Calgary

4890
02:17:09,040 --> 02:17:09,841
or out there.

4891
02:17:09,841 --> 02:17:10,050
Look,

4892
02:17:10,050 --> 02:17:11,140
look it for the bigger one.

4893
02:17:11,150 --> 02:17:11,420
Yeah.

4894
02:17:11,420 --> 02:17:14,790
Although there's a 12 ounces over there,

4895
02:17:14,800 --> 02:17:14,951
you know,

4896
02:17:14,951 --> 02:17:15,550
not all the hairs,

4897
02:17:15,550 --> 02:17:15,941
the bigger one,

4898
02:17:15,941 --> 02:17:16,141
you know,

4899
02:17:16,141 --> 02:17:16,540
I was like,

4900
02:17:16,540 --> 02:17:18,000
somebody got running around in the a,

4901
02:17:18,010 --> 02:17:22,240
there's this ice balls flying around the
block every now and then I can call it

4902
02:17:22,250 --> 02:17:25,210
on Kansas had this one in 1992,

4903
02:17:25,270 --> 02:17:28,810
two batches of severe
thunderstorms for six hours.

4904
02:17:29,230 --> 02:17:29,381
Oh,

4905
02:17:29,381 --> 02:17:34,381
within six hours of either
dumped hailstones up to four
and a half inches across

4906
02:17:34,931 --> 02:17:35,770
this area,

4907
02:17:35,950 --> 02:17:37,660
including the city of Wichita,

4908
02:17:37,750 --> 02:17:41,500
surrounding counties of
South Central Kansas.

4909
02:17:41,501 --> 02:17:43,930
And over 10,000 homes were damaged.

4910
02:17:45,160 --> 02:17:48,040
The hail left wheat fields
in a near total loss.

4911
02:17:48,280 --> 02:17:53,280
Property damage totaled $500 million with
crop damage at 100 million and below.

4912
02:17:54,710 --> 02:17:55,990
How many people died though?

4913
02:17:56,330 --> 02:17:57,280
It can't find it.

4914
02:17:57,530 --> 02:17:58,240
Can't find.

4915
02:17:58,240 --> 02:18:00,400
Imagine that he'd be the first
dummy that died from Hale.

4916
02:18:00,480 --> 02:18:01,680
They stay in when that stuff,

4917
02:18:01,940 --> 02:18:02,860
nobody dies.

4918
02:18:03,270 --> 02:18:04,240
Not fucking.

4919
02:18:04,241 --> 02:18:04,970
You're fine.

4920
02:18:04,970 --> 02:18:06,340
You're stuck a wheat.

4921
02:18:06,620 --> 02:18:07,690
It doesn't hurt that bad.

4922
02:18:07,840 --> 02:18:08,320
Let's see.

4923
02:18:08,320 --> 02:18:09,310
Hail Storm.

4924
02:18:09,340 --> 02:18:10,480
I tried to get hailstorm,

4925
02:18:10,600 --> 02:18:11,770
Fred fatalities.

4926
02:18:11,830 --> 02:18:12,760
Let's treat people die.

4927
02:18:12,761 --> 02:18:13,780
A year from Hale,

4928
02:18:14,920 --> 02:18:17,920
27 people died from tomato,

4929
02:18:17,950 --> 02:18:21,100
tornadoes and hailstorms in the Midwest.

4930
02:18:25,150 --> 02:18:27,280
What's that says here
at 900 people a year?

4931
02:18:27,650 --> 02:18:28,483
Watts.

4932
02:18:29,310 --> 02:18:30,670
How many sets from the coconut again?

4933
02:18:30,700 --> 02:18:31,210
What'd you say?

4934
02:18:31,210 --> 02:18:34,680
One 50 150 shoes.

4935
02:18:35,290 --> 02:18:36,160
Where does it say that?

4936
02:18:36,250 --> 02:18:37,420
900 a year.

4937
02:18:38,590 --> 02:18:40,240
Where's it say that it just came up.

4938
02:18:40,241 --> 02:18:43,720
How many people die from
hail and 900 a year?

4939
02:18:43,810 --> 02:18:45,730
It can be very dangerous thing.

4940
02:18:46,120 --> 02:18:48,880
Are there any instances of death?

4941
02:18:49,240 --> 02:18:52,750
There's only one here that says
they know of of the United States.

4942
02:18:53,080 --> 02:18:54,430
1939 in Lubbock,

4943
02:18:54,431 --> 02:18:54,911
Texas,

4944
02:18:54,911 --> 02:18:59,740
a farmer got caught in an open field
and died from a hail last name death.

4945
02:18:59,800 --> 02:19:04,800
Fort Collins and infant lying in its
mother's arms was killed by hail in 1979

4946
02:19:05,950 --> 02:19:06,751
can you imagine that?

4947
02:19:06,751 --> 02:19:09,400
It doesn't seem like
lots and you could do,

4948
02:19:09,401 --> 02:19:09,641
man,

4949
02:19:09,641 --> 02:19:12,550
if you were caught in an open field
and it started coming down hard,

4950
02:19:13,070 --> 02:19:13,930
kills your kid.

4951
02:19:14,080 --> 02:19:14,530
Oh,

4952
02:19:14,530 --> 02:19:15,310
that's gotta be the,

4953
02:19:15,310 --> 02:19:16,150
it's not many people,

4954
02:19:16,151 --> 02:19:16,481
man.

4955
02:19:16,481 --> 02:19:18,100
I don't believe it's 900 a year.

4956
02:19:18,260 --> 02:19:22,240
This actually says the last known death
was caused by hail and the US was in the

4957
02:19:22,241 --> 02:19:23,170
year 2000.

4958
02:19:24,460 --> 02:19:25,241
That makes sense.

4959
02:19:25,241 --> 02:19:26,620
It was 900 total.

4960
02:19:26,680 --> 02:19:26,831
Well,

4961
02:19:26,831 --> 02:19:27,261
you know what,

4962
02:19:27,261 --> 02:19:27,621
today,

4963
02:19:27,621 --> 02:19:28,010
people

4964
02:19:28,010 --> 02:19:31,820
know so much about storms and if
you live in an area where you might,

4965
02:19:31,821 --> 02:19:32,031
you know,

4966
02:19:32,031 --> 02:19:35,190
you live in some Kansas type area where
they have hailstorms on a regular basis,

4967
02:19:35,250 --> 02:19:36,083
get in.

4968
02:19:36,410 --> 02:19:36,990
Yeah,

4969
02:19:36,990 --> 02:19:38,450
we'll get the car is getting pummeled.

4970
02:19:38,540 --> 02:19:39,373
You know,

4971
02:19:39,770 --> 02:19:43,310
hurricanes are waste carrier
hurricanes and the most scary.

4972
02:19:43,350 --> 02:19:44,183
Do you ever,

4973
02:19:44,310 --> 02:19:44,990
you ever see that show,

4974
02:19:44,990 --> 02:19:46,180
this old house you remember?

4975
02:19:46,181 --> 02:19:46,321
Yeah,

4976
02:19:46,321 --> 02:19:47,154
I remember that guy,

4977
02:19:47,350 --> 02:19:48,670
Bob Dylan and uh,

4978
02:19:48,780 --> 02:19:49,800
they still have that show on,

4979
02:19:49,801 --> 02:19:50,360
I watched it,

4980
02:19:50,360 --> 02:19:50,550
uh,

4981
02:19:50,550 --> 02:19:54,900
some PBS this weekend and they were
rebuilding the Jersey shore and they were

4982
02:19:54,901 --> 02:19:57,510
showing how it's destroyed.

4983
02:19:57,540 --> 02:19:58,310
It's destroyed.

4984
02:19:58,310 --> 02:19:58,620
But so,

4985
02:19:58,620 --> 02:20:02,670
but they've had to do is go under all
these houses and like lift him up all 10

4986
02:20:02,671 --> 02:20:03,091
feet.

4987
02:20:03,091 --> 02:20:07,100
So all the houses are going up 10
feet to make them taller and taller.

4988
02:20:07,120 --> 02:20:07,980
The water comes in again.

4989
02:20:07,981 --> 02:20:08,400
They're okay.

4990
02:20:08,400 --> 02:20:08,850
Right.

4991
02:20:08,850 --> 02:20:10,920
And they have to take
these humongous like,

4992
02:20:10,950 --> 02:20:11,340
like,

4993
02:20:11,340 --> 02:20:11,760
uh,

4994
02:20:11,760 --> 02:20:13,500
like these like call holes,

4995
02:20:13,700 --> 02:20:13,951
you know,

4996
02:20:13,951 --> 02:20:17,640
they look like a telephone poles and if
they'd like push them into the ground,

4997
02:20:17,641 --> 02:20:19,110
like 20 feet or something like that,

4998
02:20:19,111 --> 02:20:19,830
I just went on,

4999
02:20:19,830 --> 02:20:20,051
I mean,

5000
02:20:20,051 --> 02:20:21,760
it's such a pain in the
ass and it's not gonna be,

5001
02:20:21,900 --> 02:20:25,290
they say a Jersey shore is probably not
going to come back for another seven to

5002
02:20:25,291 --> 02:20:28,350
10 years complete until
it's back to normal.

5003
02:20:28,380 --> 02:20:29,213
That's incredible.

5004
02:20:29,580 --> 02:20:30,960
I can't believe that
they're going to do that.

5005
02:20:31,230 --> 02:20:33,450
Make these polls and then just sit there.

5006
02:20:33,451 --> 02:20:34,410
And what if the water's on?

5007
02:20:34,520 --> 02:20:38,310
You can imagine fucking sit in your house
and the water comes up to the top of

5008
02:20:38,311 --> 02:20:39,660
the pole and you're like,

5009
02:20:39,690 --> 02:20:40,650
oh my God,

5010
02:20:40,651 --> 02:20:42,300
why don't I build a house here again?

5011
02:20:42,301 --> 02:20:43,350
What am I crazy?

5012
02:20:43,351 --> 02:20:43,740
Yeah,

5013
02:20:43,740 --> 02:20:47,130
I got the ocean on or might have
to put the boat on the roof.

5014
02:20:47,131 --> 02:20:50,490
See the ocean like slowly coming up
closer and closer to the bottom of your

5015
02:20:50,491 --> 02:20:50,791
house.

5016
02:20:50,791 --> 02:20:51,031
You're like,

5017
02:20:51,031 --> 02:20:51,650
fuck,

5018
02:20:51,650 --> 02:20:53,040
why don't you just go 20 feet?

5019
02:20:53,041 --> 02:20:54,340
Why wouldn't you just keep going first?

5020
02:20:54,360 --> 02:20:55,410
That's 20 feet.

5021
02:20:55,730 --> 02:20:58,290
You get all the way up there and the
shit would be swaying in the breeze.

5022
02:20:58,291 --> 02:21:00,750
You'd have to dig deeper
holes for the columns.

5023
02:21:01,170 --> 02:21:05,190
You'd have to worry about mean I don't
know how strong the ground is there.

5024
02:21:05,220 --> 02:21:05,500
Yeah,

5025
02:21:05,500 --> 02:21:06,640
we had a house in Hawaii.

5026
02:21:06,641 --> 02:21:07,690
It was on a poles.

5027
02:21:07,720 --> 02:21:08,860
It was a Ph.

5028
02:21:08,940 --> 02:21:09,530
Dot.

5029
02:21:09,530 --> 02:21:10,091
Right at the beach.

5030
02:21:10,091 --> 02:21:12,220
It got washed away in 69 wow.

5031
02:21:12,221 --> 02:21:12,960
Three houses.

5032
02:21:12,960 --> 02:21:14,080
The waves came up so high.

5033
02:21:14,290 --> 02:21:16,090
Is it between pipeline and why?

5034
02:21:16,091 --> 02:21:17,110
Maybe they live in sunset.

5035
02:21:17,140 --> 02:21:17,973
There was,

5036
02:21:18,040 --> 02:21:21,340
there's three houses there on poles
cause they'd been washed up on the cam

5037
02:21:21,341 --> 02:21:23,440
highway when they brought him back down,

5038
02:21:23,770 --> 02:21:26,110
they put them up on these poles
and we lived in one of them.

5039
02:21:26,500 --> 02:21:27,430
Wow.

5040
02:21:27,431 --> 02:21:28,240
This is pretty cool.

5041
02:21:28,240 --> 02:21:30,250
But there's waves never came up that high.

5042
02:21:30,251 --> 02:21:30,680
I mean,

5043
02:21:30,680 --> 02:21:32,860
I think they were only
counting on tsunamis and shit.

5044
02:21:33,300 --> 02:21:34,330
That's what that whole thing,

5045
02:21:34,331 --> 02:21:34,650
yeah,

5046
02:21:34,650 --> 02:21:35,381
the tsunami.

5047
02:21:35,381 --> 02:21:37,660
The thing is if the water comes in,

5048
02:21:38,020 --> 02:21:39,700
it's not coming in by itself.

5049
02:21:39,940 --> 02:21:40,301
Okay.

5050
02:21:40,301 --> 02:21:42,940
Did you ever watch the
tsunami that hit in Japan?

5051
02:21:42,960 --> 02:21:43,170
Yes.

5052
02:21:43,170 --> 02:21:46,860
It bringing in boats and
houses get hit by a house.

5053
02:21:46,870 --> 02:21:47,100
Get,

5054
02:21:47,100 --> 02:21:47,933
fuck

5055
02:21:49,000 --> 02:21:50,650
your house is going to get hit by a boat.

5056
02:21:51,190 --> 02:21:52,390
You don't want that to happen,

5057
02:21:52,391 --> 02:21:52,810
man.

5058
02:21:52,810 --> 02:21:53,700
You want to get out of there?

5059
02:21:54,180 --> 02:21:56,680
Just don't fucking count
on that 10 foot pole.

5060
02:21:57,220 --> 02:21:58,053
That fucking,

5061
02:21:58,330 --> 02:21:58,601
yeah.

5062
02:21:58,601 --> 02:22:00,040
There's people that stayed in,

5063
02:22:00,070 --> 02:22:00,400
uh,

5064
02:22:00,400 --> 02:22:00,910
you know,

5065
02:22:00,910 --> 02:22:01,601
many storms.

5066
02:22:01,601 --> 02:22:03,160
I remember Gloria when I was a kid,

5067
02:22:03,580 --> 02:22:06,730
when I was a kid and I lived in Boston
is when the Hurricane Gloria hit.

5068
02:22:06,731 --> 02:22:07,720
I want to say,

5069
02:22:08,200 --> 02:22:08,501
boy,

5070
02:22:08,501 --> 02:22:09,101
if I had to guess,

5071
02:22:09,101 --> 02:22:10,270
I'd have to say I was in high school,

5072
02:22:10,271 --> 02:22:12,040
so I'd say it was in the 80s,

5073
02:22:13,100 --> 02:22:13,933
but uh,

5074
02:22:13,990 --> 02:22:18,930
it was a huge one and it hit way
the fuck up the east coast and uh,

5075
02:22:18,970 --> 02:22:21,700
it put knocked the power
out and a lot of places.

5076
02:22:23,680 --> 02:22:24,490
Okay.

5077
02:22:24,490 --> 02:22:25,140
Um,

5078
02:22:25,140 --> 02:22:25,320
do,

5079
02:22:25,320 --> 02:22:25,501
do,

5080
02:22:25,501 --> 02:22:25,681
do,

5081
02:22:25,681 --> 02:22:25,891
do,

5082
02:22:25,891 --> 02:22:26,700
do,

5083
02:22:26,700 --> 02:22:28,380
it was 1985,

5084
02:22:28,590 --> 02:22:29,610
so it was when I was,

5085
02:22:29,611 --> 02:22:30,444
uh,

5086
02:22:30,540 --> 02:22:32,460
in high school and I was graduating.

5087
02:22:32,461 --> 02:22:33,090
That wasn't like the,

5088
02:22:33,090 --> 02:22:35,070
my senior year of high school was 85,

5089
02:22:35,520 --> 02:22:40,500
and that's when this fucker hit and it
hit the first major storm to affect New

5090
02:22:40,500 --> 02:22:44,760
York and long island directly
since Hurricane Donna in 1960.

5091
02:22:44,970 --> 02:22:47,220
So people went a long time.

5092
02:22:47,700 --> 02:22:52,260
They went 25 years when they
hadn't had a hurricane hit him.

5093
02:22:52,530 --> 02:22:57,530
And this motherfucker came down and
wiped out everything and power was out.

5094
02:22:58,201 --> 02:22:59,430
And I lived in Boston,

5095
02:22:59,431 --> 02:23:01,920
which is pretty far away from
the epicenter of the storm,

5096
02:23:01,921 --> 02:23:04,650
but I remember it being utterly humbling.

5097
02:23:05,010 --> 02:23:06,810
I remember we were in my house,

5098
02:23:06,811 --> 02:23:10,380
we were looking out the window and
the trees were just fucking like,

5099
02:23:10,590 --> 02:23:11,423
they were like,

5100
02:23:11,640 --> 02:23:12,810
like leaves.

5101
02:23:12,840 --> 02:23:14,580
They were blowing back and forth.

5102
02:23:14,581 --> 02:23:15,810
Like they were just leaves.

5103
02:23:15,810 --> 02:23:18,990
Like there was no weight to them and he
would see you would go out afterwards

5104
02:23:18,991 --> 02:23:20,940
and just trees would
be falling everywhere.

5105
02:23:20,941 --> 02:23:22,890
Just collapsed over streets,

5106
02:23:23,100 --> 02:23:24,360
collapsed on houses,

5107
02:23:24,361 --> 02:23:25,400
collapsing on cars,

5108
02:23:25,401 --> 02:23:27,360
just broken trees everywhere.

5109
02:23:27,690 --> 02:23:29,070
And just the feeling like,

5110
02:23:29,071 --> 02:23:29,904
whoa.

5111
02:23:30,060 --> 02:23:30,271
Like,

5112
02:23:30,271 --> 02:23:30,451
you know,

5113
02:23:30,451 --> 02:23:31,740
I had been in storms before.

5114
02:23:31,741 --> 02:23:33,060
I'd been in thunderstorms before.

5115
02:23:33,061 --> 02:23:34,290
I'd been in snowstorms before,

5116
02:23:34,560 --> 02:23:37,410
but there was something about a
hurricane and even a hurricane that,

5117
02:23:37,770 --> 02:23:38,241
you know,

5118
02:23:38,241 --> 02:23:38,400
I,

5119
02:23:38,400 --> 02:23:40,380
I was way away from the center.

5120
02:23:40,650 --> 02:23:41,850
I lived in Boston,

5121
02:23:42,150 --> 02:23:42,901
I lived in Newton,

5122
02:23:42,901 --> 02:23:43,950
Massachusetts actually.

5123
02:23:43,951 --> 02:23:44,731
So that was like,

5124
02:23:44,731 --> 02:23:45,240
you know,

5125
02:23:45,240 --> 02:23:46,590
a suburb of Boston.

5126
02:23:46,860 --> 02:23:47,101
Like,

5127
02:23:47,101 --> 02:23:47,431
man,

5128
02:23:47,431 --> 02:23:47,881
we didn't,

5129
02:23:47,881 --> 02:23:48,300
you know,

5130
02:23:48,300 --> 02:23:49,021
we didn't get enough.

5131
02:23:49,021 --> 02:23:49,520
Joel was,

5132
02:23:49,520 --> 02:23:49,800
yeah,

5133
02:23:49,800 --> 02:23:50,670
just the residual.

5134
02:23:51,390 --> 02:23:52,260
Incredible.

5135
02:23:52,680 --> 02:23:53,101
I mean,

5136
02:23:53,101 --> 02:23:53,934
it was,

5137
02:23:54,180 --> 02:23:58,140
I couldn't imagine what it would be
like to be in one of those Katrina ones.

5138
02:23:58,260 --> 02:23:58,910
The ocean is

5139
02:23:58,910 --> 02:24:00,920
so powerful that that water,

5140
02:24:00,960 --> 02:24:01,330
which,

5141
02:24:01,330 --> 02:24:02,163
you know,

5142
02:24:02,540 --> 02:24:03,171
when I was out there,

5143
02:24:03,171 --> 02:24:05,750
I started to learn how to surf two
about the same time and near death.

5144
02:24:05,751 --> 02:24:07,460
I don't know how many times
you hit by one of these waves.

5145
02:24:08,070 --> 02:24:11,030
The water possesses so much power.

5146
02:24:12,210 --> 02:24:13,970
You really have to have a respect for it,

5147
02:24:13,971 --> 02:24:14,211
you know?

5148
02:24:14,211 --> 02:24:16,340
And once it gets riled
up like that coming at,

5149
02:24:16,341 --> 02:24:17,120
yeah,

5150
02:24:17,120 --> 02:24:20,030
there's not a whole lot going
to be done to slow it down,

5151
02:24:20,031 --> 02:24:20,740
I don't think.

5152
02:24:20,740 --> 02:24:20,861
Well,

5153
02:24:20,861 --> 02:24:25,490
I think we're basing our ideas
about what the atmosphere is like,

5154
02:24:25,491 --> 02:24:26,740
like what the weather's like,

5155
02:24:26,741 --> 02:24:27,640
what the,

5156
02:24:27,670 --> 02:24:27,941
you know,

5157
02:24:27,941 --> 02:24:29,860
the safety of being around volcanoes,

5158
02:24:29,861 --> 02:24:31,060
the safety of being around the ocean.

5159
02:24:31,270 --> 02:24:34,090
We're basing it on the few hundred years.

5160
02:24:34,091 --> 02:24:36,130
If people have been paying
attention and taking notes.

5161
02:24:36,400 --> 02:24:36,820
You know,

5162
02:24:36,820 --> 02:24:38,710
how many people have
been here before that?

5163
02:24:38,740 --> 02:24:40,150
The native Americans only.

5164
02:24:40,151 --> 02:24:41,410
Really what happened to them.

5165
02:24:41,470 --> 02:24:41,771
Yeah.

5166
02:24:41,771 --> 02:24:42,850
Well that was us.

5167
02:24:42,880 --> 02:24:43,660
Most of it,

5168
02:24:43,660 --> 02:24:44,740
but the tsunami.

5169
02:24:45,040 --> 02:24:48,310
But there was certainly people
that died in that way as well.

5170
02:24:48,370 --> 02:24:49,203
You know,

5171
02:24:49,300 --> 02:24:50,680
we just didn't hear about it.

5172
02:24:50,980 --> 02:24:51,221
I mean,

5173
02:24:51,221 --> 02:24:52,270
they had to be people.

5174
02:24:52,360 --> 02:24:55,240
If people have lived in
North America for the past,

5175
02:24:55,360 --> 02:24:55,840
you know,

5176
02:24:55,840 --> 02:24:57,370
x amount of thousands of years,

5177
02:24:57,371 --> 02:25:00,490
like they have evidence that goes way
back to 10,000 years ago of people living

5178
02:25:00,491 --> 02:25:01,324
in North America.

5179
02:25:01,570 --> 02:25:03,610
So that's the case for sure.

5180
02:25:03,611 --> 02:25:04,870
Something during that time,

5181
02:25:04,871 --> 02:25:06,220
like there had been a bunch of events,

5182
02:25:06,221 --> 02:25:07,090
a bunch of things happening,

5183
02:25:07,240 --> 02:25:08,530
we just were not aware.

5184
02:25:08,650 --> 02:25:11,470
So when something like Katrina comes or
something like Gloria comes when I was

5185
02:25:11,471 --> 02:25:12,304
in high school,

5186
02:25:12,310 --> 02:25:13,240
like you,

5187
02:25:13,241 --> 02:25:13,601
you go,

5188
02:25:13,601 --> 02:25:13,841
wait,

5189
02:25:13,841 --> 02:25:14,440
is this po?

5190
02:25:14,440 --> 02:25:14,711
This,

5191
02:25:14,711 --> 02:25:15,970
this can happen to like,

5192
02:25:15,971 --> 02:25:17,050
this can fucking happen.

5193
02:25:17,410 --> 02:25:18,940
Like shouldn't we be prepared for this?

5194
02:25:18,970 --> 02:25:20,050
How often does this happen?

5195
02:25:20,260 --> 02:25:20,420
Well,

5196
02:25:20,420 --> 02:25:21,253
the last time it happens,

5197
02:25:21,280 --> 02:25:22,720
1960s I just relaxed.

5198
02:25:23,880 --> 02:25:24,190
Okay.

5199
02:25:24,190 --> 02:25:24,851
But it can happen,

5200
02:25:24,851 --> 02:25:25,150
right?

5201
02:25:25,150 --> 02:25:25,983
This can happen.

5202
02:25:26,110 --> 02:25:29,350
You should prepare for this now
that you know that this can happen,

5203
02:25:29,560 --> 02:25:32,560
there should be no houses that are built
from here on out that can't deal with

5204
02:25:32,561 --> 02:25:34,420
this because it might not happen,

5205
02:25:34,450 --> 02:25:35,710
but it could fucking happen.

5206
02:25:35,711 --> 02:25:38,770
It has happened and you
got to have them on record.

5207
02:25:39,040 --> 02:25:42,070
You've got one from 1960
you got one from 1985 dot.

5208
02:25:42,080 --> 02:25:43,480
What the fuck do I have to tell you?

5209
02:25:43,570 --> 02:25:44,290
We're waiting for that.

5210
02:25:44,290 --> 02:25:45,430
These pitches are happening.

5211
02:25:45,431 --> 02:25:46,264
They're coming.

5212
02:25:46,450 --> 02:25:47,170
Let's get ready.

5213
02:25:47,170 --> 02:25:48,010
You don't know what can happen.

5214
02:25:48,011 --> 02:25:49,180
You can get three of them in a year,

5215
02:25:49,240 --> 02:25:51,310
like the ones that existed before.

5216
02:25:51,311 --> 02:25:52,570
People measured things.

5217
02:25:52,600 --> 02:25:53,620
They still existed.

5218
02:25:53,740 --> 02:25:57,340
The giant fucking storms that killed
people before meteorologists were invented

5219
02:25:57,520 --> 02:26:01,870
were still valid and this idea that
we're basing it off on this tiny little

5220
02:26:01,871 --> 02:26:03,430
window that we've been
alive and I've fucking,

5221
02:26:03,740 --> 02:26:07,280
I've been in La since 94 I haven't seen
a single fucking significant earthquake.

5222
02:26:07,280 --> 02:26:08,510
There's not worry if
everybody's supposedly,

5223
02:26:08,670 --> 02:26:09,520
are you crazy?

5224
02:26:09,910 --> 02:26:12,410
This fucking things on a
piece of moving ground.

5225
02:26:12,411 --> 02:26:12,621
This is,

5226
02:26:12,621 --> 02:26:16,930
you don't live long enough for it to move
that much because the perspective that

5227
02:26:18,340 --> 02:26:20,770
you're looking at in terms
of a human life perspective,

5228
02:26:21,170 --> 02:26:24,430
you've got to look at it in a fractal
sense like earth and there's no

5229
02:26:24,431 --> 02:26:25,264
guarantees.

5230
02:26:25,330 --> 02:26:25,840
Yeah.

5231
02:26:25,840 --> 02:26:27,430
This years is nothing.

5232
02:26:27,520 --> 02:26:29,560
It could be right now
it's time could be up.

5233
02:26:29,800 --> 02:26:31,450
We'll just think about what
we were talking about before.

5234
02:26:31,451 --> 02:26:33,880
The difference between us
and the people in the 1940s,

5235
02:26:33,940 --> 02:26:36,850
the difference between the people in
1940s in the difference between them and

5236
02:26:36,851 --> 02:26:39,790
the people in the 1820s add
all that stuff up together,

5237
02:26:39,910 --> 02:26:40,451
look at it,

5238
02:26:40,451 --> 02:26:42,340
and just go back a few times like that.

5239
02:26:42,341 --> 02:26:43,570
A few generations like that.

5240
02:26:43,870 --> 02:26:45,460
And that's what we have.

5241
02:26:45,760 --> 02:26:47,350
That's the amount of information we have.

5242
02:26:47,351 --> 02:26:48,670
And in that time,

5243
02:26:48,671 --> 02:26:49,690
in those time periods,

5244
02:26:49,900 --> 02:26:51,070
we have a bunch of them.

5245
02:26:51,220 --> 02:26:54,220
We have the earthquake
and fire in San Francisco,

5246
02:26:54,400 --> 02:26:55,750
we have floods,

5247
02:26:55,900 --> 02:26:58,030
we have Hurricane Katrina,

5248
02:26:58,031 --> 02:26:59,160
we have glory.

5249
02:26:59,380 --> 02:27:01,690
We have the most recent ones.

5250
02:27:01,691 --> 02:27:01,801
The,

5251
02:27:01,801 --> 02:27:05,350
the tornadoes that the
one that fucking town in.

5252
02:27:05,380 --> 02:27:06,070
Um,

5253
02:27:06,070 --> 02:27:07,570
what was the town that Joplin,

5254
02:27:07,571 --> 02:27:10,990
Mississippi like almost
completely wiped off the map.

5255
02:27:11,260 --> 02:27:12,580
I believe it was Joplin.

5256
02:27:12,581 --> 02:27:13,600
I should probably put her here.

5257
02:27:13,601 --> 02:27:14,434
Mississippi,

5258
02:27:14,890 --> 02:27:15,281
Missouri.

5259
02:27:15,281 --> 02:27:15,551
Yeah,

5260
02:27:15,551 --> 02:27:15,911
you're right.

5261
02:27:15,911 --> 02:27:16,241
You're right.

5262
02:27:16,241 --> 02:27:16,690
You're right.

5263
02:27:16,690 --> 02:27:17,111
Joplin,

5264
02:27:17,111 --> 02:27:20,240
Missouri was favorite places.

5265
02:27:21,190 --> 02:27:22,023
Hang out in Joplin.

5266
02:27:22,200 --> 02:27:23,170
Tornado.

5267
02:27:24,280 --> 02:27:25,113
They,

5268
02:27:25,190 --> 02:27:25,900
he's joking.

5269
02:27:25,900 --> 02:27:26,321
He's joking,

5270
02:27:26,321 --> 02:27:26,580
Bro.

5271
02:27:26,580 --> 02:27:26,800
Yeah.

5272
02:27:26,800 --> 02:27:29,080
In 2011 and Joplin,

5273
02:27:29,300 --> 02:27:31,000
a tornado struck Joplin,

5274
02:27:31,001 --> 02:27:31,834
Missouri.

5275
02:27:32,290 --> 02:27:32,830
Uh,

5276
02:27:32,830 --> 02:27:33,730
it was a large,

5277
02:27:34,330 --> 02:27:39,330
a larger late May tornado outbreak and
it reached a maximum width ready for this

5278
02:27:40,150 --> 02:27:42,430
of one mile.

5279
02:27:42,910 --> 02:27:44,920
A width of a mile.

5280
02:27:45,250 --> 02:27:46,540
A Tornado.

5281
02:27:46,780 --> 02:27:48,260
That's a why?

5282
02:27:48,850 --> 02:27:49,121
No,

5283
02:27:49,121 --> 02:27:49,391
no,

5284
02:27:49,391 --> 02:27:49,631
no,

5285
02:27:49,631 --> 02:27:49,901
no,

5286
02:27:49,901 --> 02:27:50,171
no,

5287
02:27:50,171 --> 02:27:50,441
no,

5288
02:27:50,441 --> 02:27:50,920
no.

5289
02:27:50,920 --> 02:27:52,870
That's the devastation path.

5290
02:27:53,100 --> 02:27:53,360
Oh,

5291
02:27:53,360 --> 02:27:56,590
a mile wide when it comes
through the terrorists of five,

5292
02:27:57,940 --> 02:27:58,773
I don't know.

5293
02:27:58,780 --> 02:28:00,310
What's the FBI in that classification?

5294
02:28:00,311 --> 02:28:01,210
I don't know what that means.

5295
02:28:01,250 --> 02:28:02,590
I just know it means death.

5296
02:28:02,800 --> 02:28:03,550
Uh,

5297
02:28:03,550 --> 02:28:04,130
yeah.

5298
02:28:04,130 --> 02:28:08,740
Like a reach a maximum width of nearly
one mile during its path through the

5299
02:28:08,741 --> 02:28:10,060
southern part of the city.

5300
02:28:10,240 --> 02:28:14,050
It rapidly intensified and tracked
eastward through across the city and then

5301
02:28:14,051 --> 02:28:19,051
continued eastward across interstate 44
into rural sections of Jasper County and

5302
02:28:19,751 --> 02:28:20,590
Newton County.

5303
02:28:20,860 --> 02:28:21,140
It,

5304
02:28:21,140 --> 02:28:25,010
the third tornado destroyed
Joplin's since May of 1971,

5305
02:28:25,250 --> 02:28:30,250
the tornado killed 158 people with
the additional four indirect deaths,

5306
02:28:30,831 --> 02:28:32,330
injured some 1000,

5307
02:28:32,331 --> 02:28:37,331
150 others and caused damages
amounted to two point $8 billion.

5308
02:28:37,461 --> 02:28:41,390
It was the deadliest tornado to strike
the United States since the 1947

5309
02:28:41,391 --> 02:28:42,224
tornadoes.

5310
02:28:42,920 --> 02:28:43,753
Whoa.

5311
02:28:43,940 --> 02:28:47,660
Since the turn it in a
47 there was multiple.

5312
02:28:48,500 --> 02:28:49,120
Yeah.

5313
02:28:49,120 --> 02:28:50,770
There was the glacier,

5314
02:28:51,650 --> 02:28:53,000
the glacier Higgins,

5315
02:28:53,001 --> 02:28:55,990
Woodward tornadoes in 1947 sure.

5316
02:28:56,690 --> 02:28:57,500
Yeah.

5317
02:28:57,500 --> 02:28:58,071
And these,

5318
02:28:58,071 --> 02:28:58,281
uh,

5319
02:28:58,281 --> 02:29:03,281
they traveled 125 miles from Texas to
Oklahoma destroying everything in its path

5320
02:29:05,000 --> 02:29:09,200
because it was originally thought
to have left a 220 mile path,

5321
02:29:09,350 --> 02:29:12,440
but it's now believed to have been
a part of a family of eight or nine

5322
02:29:12,441 --> 02:29:13,274
tornadoes.

5323
02:29:13,310 --> 02:29:15,460
Ooh.

5324
02:29:15,770 --> 02:29:15,921
Oh,

5325
02:29:15,921 --> 02:29:18,410
fucking family of tornadoes.

5326
02:29:18,590 --> 02:29:19,430
These tornadoes,

5327
02:29:19,431 --> 02:29:20,211
although deadly,

5328
02:29:20,211 --> 02:29:23,360
did not match the astounding
death toll of the earlier event.

5329
02:29:23,630 --> 02:29:27,080
Nor did they match the record
speed of that tornado or the,

5330
02:29:27,081 --> 02:29:29,900
although at over 40 miles per hour,

5331
02:29:29,901 --> 02:29:32,390
they qualified as a fast tracking storm.

5332
02:29:33,290 --> 02:29:33,980
Wow.

5333
02:29:33,980 --> 02:29:34,341
Mom,

5334
02:29:34,341 --> 02:29:35,174
I'm home,

5335
02:29:35,930 --> 02:29:36,430
dude.

5336
02:29:36,430 --> 02:29:39,770
Could you fucking imagine looking out
your window and seeing nine tornadoes

5337
02:29:39,771 --> 02:29:42,650
coming at you and just thinking about
all the times you jerked off and what the

5338
02:29:42,651 --> 02:29:44,860
Bible told you and you're
like thinking it was you.

5339
02:29:45,220 --> 02:29:45,950
You know,

5340
02:29:45,950 --> 02:29:49,230
if you lived in 1947 very low
cost are coming on top of it,

5341
02:29:49,240 --> 02:29:49,911
they know it's over.

5342
02:29:49,911 --> 02:29:53,330
If you were in Texas and it was 1947
you could convince yourself that those

5343
02:29:53,331 --> 02:29:55,280
tornadoes we're coming for
you because you jerked off.

5344
02:29:55,730 --> 02:30:00,560
If you were 16 if you were some kid
who's just resisting church so bad,

5345
02:30:00,680 --> 02:30:01,340
but you couldn't,

5346
02:30:01,340 --> 02:30:03,480
you couldn't stop beating off
and you still go to church,

5347
02:30:03,530 --> 02:30:06,380
dad would scream at you and you're in
there beaten off and you look out the

5348
02:30:06,381 --> 02:30:10,940
window and you see nine tornadoes headed
your thing and you're fucking convinced

5349
02:30:10,941 --> 02:30:13,940
it was you convinced it was
you that killed everybody.

5350
02:30:14,120 --> 02:30:19,120
Fire and Brimstone Brian
Red Band masturbate and the
devil is sent his edge men

5351
02:30:20,000 --> 02:30:23,870
to take you out of the path and out of
the path of righteousness and you have to

5352
02:30:23,871 --> 02:30:26,240
become a priest because everyone
in the town died cause he you,

5353
02:30:26,510 --> 02:30:29,420
you and your beating off you
fuck family or tornadoes.

5354
02:30:29,750 --> 02:30:30,110
Yeah,

5355
02:30:30,110 --> 02:30:31,430
that's a terrifying idea.

5356
02:30:31,760 --> 02:30:34,630
There's a lot of heavy vibes on
that man and you know you're behind.

5357
02:30:34,670 --> 02:30:37,220
It's a mile wide tornado.

5358
02:30:38,330 --> 02:30:39,141
What the hell,

5359
02:30:39,141 --> 02:30:39,290
man?

5360
02:30:39,290 --> 02:30:41,060
Nine of them now a little patch.

5361
02:30:41,090 --> 02:30:41,901
I wonder if I'm accurate.

5362
02:30:41,901 --> 02:30:42,620
Tornadoes.

5363
02:30:42,620 --> 02:30:46,010
I'm wonder if I'm correct saying the
mile of destruction because it sounded so

5364
02:30:46,011 --> 02:30:47,900
much better than just the
actual width of the storm.

5365
02:30:47,990 --> 02:30:50,090
So happy we don't have to
deal with tornadoes man.

5366
02:30:50,091 --> 02:30:51,690
That shit was so I saw one the other day.

5367
02:30:52,130 --> 02:30:54,860
I saw one the other day where
I saw a tornado of leaves.

5368
02:30:55,010 --> 02:30:55,430
Oh yeah,

5369
02:30:55,430 --> 02:30:56,040
out of nowhere.

5370
02:30:56,040 --> 02:30:56,873
Yeah.

5371
02:30:57,200 --> 02:30:58,460
Weirdest shit ever.

5372
02:30:58,461 --> 02:31:02,270
I mean it wasn't 22 the kills obviously
I was driving and I stopped my car to

5373
02:31:02,271 --> 02:31:02,800
watch it.

5374
02:31:02,800 --> 02:31:02,990
Yeah.

5375
02:31:02,990 --> 02:31:03,470
Crazy.

5376
02:31:03,470 --> 02:31:05,030
You ever gone through like the desert?

5377
02:31:05,031 --> 02:31:05,491
Like it like,

5378
02:31:05,491 --> 02:31:07,730
like driving to like Vegas or something
and you'll just see on the side of the

5379
02:31:07,731 --> 02:31:09,370
road like a sand tornado.

5380
02:31:09,410 --> 02:31:09,681
You're like,

5381
02:31:09,681 --> 02:31:10,401
what the fuck is that?

5382
02:31:10,401 --> 02:31:11,420
Is that going to hurt me?

5383
02:31:12,150 --> 02:31:12,721
Yeah.

5384
02:31:12,721 --> 02:31:13,500
Right.

5385
02:31:13,500 --> 02:31:13,921
Like,

5386
02:31:13,921 --> 02:31:14,700
um,

5387
02:31:14,700 --> 02:31:15,720
they can get them.

5388
02:31:16,020 --> 02:31:18,130
I mean they have gotten them
in California before we,

5389
02:31:18,131 --> 02:31:18,990
we looked that up one.

5390
02:31:19,440 --> 02:31:20,390
What is a tornado

5391
02:31:20,410 --> 02:31:21,000
anyway?

5392
02:31:21,000 --> 02:31:22,200
Some sort of a weather condition.

5393
02:31:22,201 --> 02:31:22,860
Something that,

5394
02:31:22,860 --> 02:31:25,140
whether it stops and
it starts to spinning.

5395
02:31:25,200 --> 02:31:27,830
I believe it's like cold
weather mixing was warm weather.

5396
02:31:27,840 --> 02:31:28,673
Yeah.

5397
02:31:28,900 --> 02:31:29,733
Cold France.

5398
02:31:29,990 --> 02:31:30,601
Warm,

5399
02:31:30,601 --> 02:31:31,470
warm weather is,

5400
02:31:31,480 --> 02:31:32,520
it's a spin just,

5401
02:31:32,521 --> 02:31:33,150
I dunno.

5402
02:31:33,150 --> 02:31:33,510
I Dunno.

5403
02:31:33,510 --> 02:31:33,691
Okay,

5404
02:31:33,691 --> 02:31:34,350
well let's look it up.

5405
02:31:34,350 --> 02:31:36,300
Let's talk about what causes
the tornado is a tornado.

5406
02:31:36,310 --> 02:31:39,660
This is clone to learn today.

5407
02:31:39,770 --> 02:31:40,920
What we're learning every day.

5408
02:31:40,980 --> 02:31:41,813
Hopefully.

5409
02:31:42,330 --> 02:31:42,690
Well,

5410
02:31:42,690 --> 02:31:43,920
I'm not going to go along with that.

5411
02:31:43,921 --> 02:31:45,850
I'm still holding the cards.

5412
02:31:45,870 --> 02:31:46,703
You are.

5413
02:31:46,800 --> 02:31:48,960
It's more sexy black helicopters.

5414
02:31:49,250 --> 02:31:54,120
A tornado is a violently rotating column
of air that is in contact with both the

5415
02:31:54,121 --> 02:31:55,380
surface of the earth.

5416
02:31:55,440 --> 02:31:56,940
N A.

5417
02:31:56,940 --> 02:31:56,941
Okay.

5418
02:31:56,941 --> 02:31:57,810
Ready for this one.

5419
02:31:58,380 --> 02:31:58,890
Woo.

5420
02:31:58,890 --> 02:31:59,723
How do you say this?

5421
02:32:00,310 --> 02:32:01,100
Cute.

5422
02:32:01,100 --> 02:32:01,440
C,

5423
02:32:01,440 --> 02:32:04,320
U M U L O n I m.

5424
02:32:04,590 --> 02:32:07,340
B u s cubed come.

5425
02:32:07,350 --> 02:32:12,350
You'll lawn m bus come Yulana mum bus com.

5426
02:32:13,580 --> 02:32:18,580
Kuma cumulonimbus cloud Ku Mula Nimbus
Coombe you low Nimbus cloud or in rare

5427
02:32:21,721 --> 02:32:25,110
cases a a the base of a cumulus cloud.

5428
02:32:25,410 --> 02:32:29,400
They're often come cumulus and they
were often referred to as twisters are

5429
02:32:29,401 --> 02:32:29,940
cyclones,

5430
02:32:29,940 --> 02:32:34,200
although the word cyclone is using
meteorology in a wider sense to name any

5431
02:32:34,201 --> 02:32:36,000
close low pressure circulation.

5432
02:32:36,090 --> 02:32:38,520
Tornadoes come in many shapes and sizes,

5433
02:32:38,521 --> 02:32:43,521
but they're typically in the form of a
visible condensation funnel who's narrow

5434
02:32:44,191 --> 02:32:49,191
and touches the earth in its often
encircled by a cloud of debris and dust.

5435
02:32:49,620 --> 02:32:51,210
Have you ever seen the video from Dallas,

5436
02:32:51,211 --> 02:32:55,620
Texas from two years ago where
semis were flying through the air?

5437
02:32:56,240 --> 02:32:57,073
Maybe twister,

5438
02:32:57,120 --> 02:32:57,953
pull that up.

5439
02:32:57,960 --> 02:33:01,800
Pull up semis flying
through the air in Dallas.

5440
02:33:01,801 --> 02:33:02,520
Twister.

5441
02:33:02,520 --> 02:33:04,010
It was the curb.

5442
02:33:04,050 --> 02:33:05,010
Craziest shit.

5443
02:33:05,250 --> 02:33:06,510
I was watching it on TV.

5444
02:33:06,540 --> 02:33:08,400
I was in Texas at the time too.

5445
02:33:08,401 --> 02:33:10,470
I was in another part of Texas and the,

5446
02:33:11,470 --> 02:33:11,600
Oh,

5447
02:33:11,600 --> 02:33:11,941
wait a minute.

5448
02:33:11,941 --> 02:33:12,774
That's not true.

5449
02:33:13,080 --> 02:33:13,500
Okay.

5450
02:33:13,500 --> 02:33:13,660
No,

5451
02:33:13,660 --> 02:33:14,930
it was in Texas during another one,

5452
02:33:14,960 --> 02:33:16,070
but it wasn't this one,

5453
02:33:16,100 --> 02:33:17,690
the one where they had it on the news.

5454
02:33:17,870 --> 02:33:19,190
I think I was in another state,

5455
02:33:19,310 --> 02:33:20,330
but I could've been in Texas.

5456
02:33:20,331 --> 02:33:20,631
I was like,

5457
02:33:20,631 --> 02:33:21,650
I was on the road and I was like,

5458
02:33:21,680 --> 02:33:22,670
I could have been in Texas right now.

5459
02:33:22,760 --> 02:33:23,990
I've been to Texas.

5460
02:33:25,160 --> 02:33:25,820
Anyway,

5461
02:33:25,820 --> 02:33:27,950
point being I'm watching
the news and here it is.

5462
02:33:27,951 --> 02:33:30,100
This is exactly the footage
and there's a Twitter,

5463
02:33:30,101 --> 02:33:30,591
so twist her.

5464
02:33:30,591 --> 02:33:35,210
This is on the fucking news and the
guy's talking and you see actual

5465
02:33:35,640 --> 02:33:36,473
cool

5466
02:33:36,670 --> 02:33:40,630
semi like tractor trailers
flying through the fucking air,

5467
02:33:40,631 --> 02:33:41,680
like paper cups,

5468
02:33:41,681 --> 02:33:42,514
man.

5469
02:33:42,760 --> 02:33:44,140
Like as you're seeing this,

5470
02:33:44,141 --> 02:33:45,250
this funnel spinning,

5471
02:33:45,251 --> 02:33:45,581
look at that.

5472
02:33:45,581 --> 02:33:46,030
See that?

5473
02:33:46,030 --> 02:33:46,810
Ah,

5474
02:33:46,810 --> 02:33:48,300
those are tractor trailers,

5475
02:33:48,310 --> 02:33:49,030
man.

5476
02:33:49,030 --> 02:33:49,480
And look,

5477
02:33:49,480 --> 02:33:51,010
they get are we log in,

5478
02:33:51,220 --> 02:33:51,521
look at it.

5479
02:33:51,521 --> 02:33:53,110
You see the things crackles.

5480
02:33:53,111 --> 02:33:55,300
You only electrical
fires cause there were,

5481
02:33:55,650 --> 02:33:56,980
they're removing them.

5482
02:33:57,360 --> 02:34:01,750
They're removing electrical cables and
shit from the ground and shorting things

5483
02:34:01,751 --> 02:34:02,140
out.

5484
02:34:02,140 --> 02:34:06,490
And eventually it picks up these tractor
trailers and is they're flying through

5485
02:34:06,491 --> 02:34:07,390
the fucking air.

5486
02:34:08,340 --> 02:34:08,600
Okay.

5487
02:34:08,600 --> 02:34:09,710
Is this the same video?

5488
02:34:09,830 --> 02:34:10,940
I believe it is.

5489
02:34:12,840 --> 02:34:13,381
Okay there.

5490
02:34:13,381 --> 02:34:15,630
There's one flying
through the fucking air.

5491
02:34:16,320 --> 02:34:17,140
Look at that.

5492
02:34:17,140 --> 02:34:18,010
That's attracted

5493
02:34:18,010 --> 02:34:19,000
trailer bro.

5494
02:34:19,120 --> 02:34:20,380
It's flying.

5495
02:34:20,850 --> 02:34:21,431
I mean what does it,

5496
02:34:21,431 --> 02:34:22,360
what does that way,

5497
02:34:23,260 --> 02:34:23,621
what does it,

5498
02:34:23,621 --> 02:34:25,750
but it's got away a few thousand pounds.

5499
02:34:25,900 --> 02:34:27,910
Well it depends if it's
got anything in it too.

5500
02:34:27,950 --> 02:34:28,271
Well yeah,

5501
02:34:28,271 --> 02:34:28,820
but if it does,

5502
02:34:28,820 --> 02:34:30,190
even if it doesn't have anything in it,

5503
02:34:30,230 --> 02:34:30,850
because there's one,

5504
02:34:30,850 --> 02:34:31,360
yeah,

5505
02:34:31,360 --> 02:34:33,940
that's flying through the
air and landing on shit.

5506
02:34:33,970 --> 02:34:34,481
Boom.

5507
02:34:34,481 --> 02:34:35,920
It's throwing it through the air.

5508
02:34:36,700 --> 02:34:39,730
Those are all like cargo
boxes and tractor trailers.

5509
02:34:39,910 --> 02:34:40,510
It's crazy.

5510
02:34:40,510 --> 02:34:41,680
Look at all those tractor trailers.

5511
02:34:41,830 --> 02:34:43,180
She's jacked,

5512
02:34:43,960 --> 02:34:48,960
picked up and tossed and twisted
around like like an aluminum foil.

5513
02:34:49,540 --> 02:34:50,440
Amazing.

5514
02:34:50,530 --> 02:34:54,130
The landed near the
highway is fucking crazy.

5515
02:34:54,430 --> 02:34:57,340
Mother Nature's the pitch doesn't play.

5516
02:34:58,660 --> 02:34:59,650
It's on her terms.

5517
02:34:59,700 --> 02:35:00,100
Yeah,

5518
02:35:00,100 --> 02:35:00,933
it is on our terms,

5519
02:35:01,030 --> 02:35:06,030
especially when we're fucking around
light and shit on fire and sending rocket

5520
02:35:06,101 --> 02:35:07,180
ships in the space.

5521
02:35:07,210 --> 02:35:12,210
Fucking with the air airplanes burn and
few and Carter burning few and add into

5522
02:35:13,541 --> 02:35:14,374
the pollution.

5523
02:35:14,740 --> 02:35:15,280
Yeah,

5524
02:35:15,280 --> 02:35:16,113
it's weird.

5525
02:35:16,210 --> 02:35:17,080
But even if we didn't,

5526
02:35:17,500 --> 02:35:18,340
even if we didn't add,

5527
02:35:18,580 --> 02:35:20,530
even if we did in the places
that God damn horrifying mess,

5528
02:35:20,800 --> 02:35:22,330
even if we didn't do a goddamn thing,

5529
02:35:22,331 --> 02:35:24,520
if we lived our lives
completely egocentric,

5530
02:35:24,730 --> 02:35:26,650
if we lived our lives
with organic farming,

5531
02:35:26,740 --> 02:35:29,710
if we lived our lives in a completely
harmonious way with nature,

5532
02:35:29,860 --> 02:35:34,030
we could still get smushed by
big Robert Space clobbered.

5533
02:35:34,540 --> 02:35:35,400
Boom.

5534
02:35:35,740 --> 02:35:36,430
Yeah.

5535
02:35:36,430 --> 02:35:38,170
Not to say that we shouldn't be,

5536
02:35:38,470 --> 02:35:39,070
you know,

5537
02:35:39,070 --> 02:35:41,380
loving to our mother earth
and we absolutely should.

5538
02:35:42,280 --> 02:35:43,001
Absolutely.

5539
02:35:43,001 --> 02:35:44,110
100% without a doubt.

5540
02:35:44,111 --> 02:35:45,100
No argument from me,

5541
02:35:45,130 --> 02:35:48,820
but it's possible for us to get
fucked up by a super volcano.

5542
02:35:48,850 --> 02:35:49,690
Even if we did,

5543
02:35:50,260 --> 02:35:52,360
even if we did an ice age can come,

5544
02:35:52,390 --> 02:35:54,220
even if we did the best we could do.

5545
02:35:54,280 --> 02:35:57,960
Well the dinosaurs are all die
where they hit it with a media.

5546
02:35:58,090 --> 02:35:58,331
No,

5547
02:35:58,331 --> 02:35:59,690
they were using their
cell phones too much.

5548
02:35:59,690 --> 02:36:00,521
Shoot myself itself,

5549
02:36:00,521 --> 02:36:01,750
the fucking cell phone,

5550
02:36:01,990 --> 02:36:02,171
uh,

5551
02:36:02,171 --> 02:36:03,960
drew in magic.

5552
02:36:03,970 --> 02:36:08,200
They found old cell phones that
dinosaurs used and we realize we're super

5553
02:36:08,201 --> 02:36:09,620
fucking smart but had cell phones.

5554
02:36:09,830 --> 02:36:12,100
I picture that guy on that line and uh,

5555
02:36:12,200 --> 02:36:15,400
he was in the beginning of a movie and
he was walking by with a phone on his ear

5556
02:36:15,680 --> 02:36:16,930
is in front of man's theater.

5557
02:36:17,380 --> 02:36:18,161
What was that movie?

5558
02:36:18,161 --> 02:36:18,551
There was a,

5559
02:36:18,551 --> 02:36:18,750
a,

5560
02:36:18,750 --> 02:36:23,650
a last clip they found off of an
old movie Charlie Chaplin Movie.

5561
02:36:23,950 --> 02:36:24,431
Oh No,

5562
02:36:24,431 --> 02:36:24,611
no,

5563
02:36:24,611 --> 02:36:24,830
no,

5564
02:36:24,830 --> 02:36:25,540
no.

5565
02:36:25,540 --> 02:36:27,670
He had everyone thought,

5566
02:36:27,730 --> 02:36:27,940
wow,

5567
02:36:27,940 --> 02:36:29,110
that guy walking by with a thing.

5568
02:36:29,320 --> 02:36:29,600
Yeah.

5569
02:36:29,600 --> 02:36:30,520
It's not what it was.

5570
02:36:30,700 --> 02:36:33,970
There was an invention that they had
come up with for people that were hard of

5571
02:36:33,971 --> 02:36:36,620
hearing before they had hearing
aids and you hold it up to a year.

5572
02:36:36,640 --> 02:36:37,840
It would magnify the sound.

5573
02:36:38,350 --> 02:36:39,183
That's what it was.

5574
02:36:39,250 --> 02:36:40,300
And so to,

5575
02:36:40,330 --> 02:36:42,310
in a blurry image when
you're looking at it,

5576
02:36:42,370 --> 02:36:43,090
you know?

5577
02:36:43,090 --> 02:36:43,271
Yeah.

5578
02:36:43,271 --> 02:36:44,480
It's like a future guys.

5579
02:36:44,481 --> 02:36:45,400
It's on a cell phone.

5580
02:36:46,000 --> 02:36:46,300
You know,

5581
02:36:46,300 --> 02:36:46,931
to this day,

5582
02:36:46,931 --> 02:36:48,480
people have ear problems and they,

5583
02:36:48,481 --> 02:36:49,840
they get hearing aids.

5584
02:36:49,880 --> 02:36:50,830
I see him a lot.

5585
02:36:50,831 --> 02:36:51,730
They stick out of their ear.

5586
02:36:52,150 --> 02:36:52,510
Well,

5587
02:36:52,510 --> 02:36:53,500
back in those days,

5588
02:36:53,501 --> 02:36:54,730
they just held it up to their ear.

5589
02:36:54,880 --> 02:36:55,091
Right,

5590
02:36:55,091 --> 02:36:55,430
right.

5591
02:36:55,430 --> 02:36:56,470
So that was a sound.

5592
02:36:56,471 --> 02:36:57,304
A

5593
02:36:58,360 --> 02:36:59,470
sound amplifier.

5594
02:37:00,160 --> 02:37:00,430
Yeah.

5595
02:37:00,430 --> 02:37:02,050
If someone's going to do time travel,

5596
02:37:02,110 --> 02:37:03,850
I don't think they would go
to the Charlie Chaplin days.

5597
02:37:04,220 --> 02:37:04,840
Yeah.

5598
02:37:04,840 --> 02:37:05,330
Yeah.

5599
02:37:05,330 --> 02:37:07,360
Are they going to hang around
here and do that for you?

5600
02:37:07,361 --> 02:37:10,270
Imagine if we did find out that some
dude's been fucking traveling back in time

5601
02:37:10,271 --> 02:37:11,590
from the future and we
get up to the future.

5602
02:37:11,591 --> 02:37:12,424
One day we meet him,

5603
02:37:12,760 --> 02:37:13,001
you're like,

5604
02:37:13,001 --> 02:37:13,481
wait a minute,

5605
02:37:13,481 --> 02:37:13,810
Dick,

5606
02:37:13,810 --> 02:37:15,290
I've seen you before you out.

5607
02:37:15,291 --> 02:37:16,250
He's Jimmy Hendricks.

5608
02:37:16,251 --> 02:37:17,000
He's fucking,

5609
02:37:17,000 --> 02:37:18,260
he's been a bunch of different people.

5610
02:37:18,680 --> 02:37:18,921
You know,

5611
02:37:18,921 --> 02:37:21,620
like he's just been going back in
time and be in a bad mother fucker.

5612
02:37:21,621 --> 02:37:23,120
But really it's just
some guy from the future.

5613
02:37:23,660 --> 02:37:24,411
You never know.

5614
02:37:24,411 --> 02:37:24,860
You know?

5615
02:37:24,860 --> 02:37:25,040
No,

5616
02:37:25,040 --> 02:37:25,581
you do know.

5617
02:37:25,581 --> 02:37:26,450
That's ridiculous.

5618
02:37:26,480 --> 02:37:27,313
And I'm stoned.

5619
02:37:27,720 --> 02:37:28,553
Dare you.

5620
02:37:29,290 --> 02:37:29,481
Don't,

5621
02:37:29,481 --> 02:37:30,220
you never know.

5622
02:37:30,220 --> 02:37:35,220
You're hoping Hendrick shows back
up all their city Hendricks here.

5623
02:37:35,750 --> 02:37:36,021
Listen,

5624
02:37:36,021 --> 02:37:36,860
it was already here.

5625
02:37:36,920 --> 02:37:37,240
I love,

5626
02:37:37,240 --> 02:37:38,240
I've got to Hendrick shirt on,

5627
02:37:38,241 --> 02:37:39,074
man.

5628
02:37:40,530 --> 02:37:42,110
It's got a poster here.

5629
02:37:42,440 --> 02:37:43,870
That's a cat that left there.

5630
02:37:44,840 --> 02:37:45,680
Something behind that,

5631
02:37:45,690 --> 02:37:46,523
which is awesome.

5632
02:37:47,430 --> 02:37:48,350
He doesn't need to come back.

5633
02:37:48,550 --> 02:37:49,250
Oh yeah,

5634
02:37:49,250 --> 02:37:50,000
he did his time.

5635
02:37:50,000 --> 02:37:50,200
Yeah.

5636
02:37:50,200 --> 02:37:53,690
Now you got Gary Clark Jr and I'm not
saying Gary Clark Jr is equivalent to

5637
02:37:53,691 --> 02:37:54,140
Hendricks,

5638
02:37:54,140 --> 02:37:54,973
but I'm saying,

5639
02:37:54,980 --> 02:37:55,310
look,

5640
02:37:55,310 --> 02:37:56,930
there's always going to be honey honey.

5641
02:37:56,931 --> 02:37:58,040
There's always going to be,

5642
02:37:58,041 --> 02:37:58,370
you know,

5643
02:37:58,370 --> 02:37:59,540
new bands that come out.

5644
02:37:59,541 --> 02:38:00,351
There's always going to be like,

5645
02:38:00,351 --> 02:38:00,920
cool,

5646
02:38:00,920 --> 02:38:01,330
let's go.

5647
02:38:01,330 --> 02:38:02,930
Sounds is a black keys.

5648
02:38:02,931 --> 02:38:03,764
There's always going to be,

5649
02:38:04,040 --> 02:38:04,873
you know,

5650
02:38:05,270 --> 02:38:06,290
there's always cool shit,

5651
02:38:06,291 --> 02:38:06,620
man.

5652
02:38:06,620 --> 02:38:07,460
It's always coming out.

5653
02:38:07,640 --> 02:38:08,473
I'm glad.

5654
02:38:08,480 --> 02:38:09,230
Fuck yeah.

5655
02:38:09,230 --> 02:38:10,940
This is the best time ever.

5656
02:38:11,090 --> 02:38:11,923
I agree.

5657
02:38:13,250 --> 02:38:14,690
This is the best time ever on earth.

5658
02:38:14,710 --> 02:38:17,990
It's silly for not taking
advantage of the situation.

5659
02:38:17,991 --> 02:38:19,460
Then here's what we have.

5660
02:38:19,461 --> 02:38:19,970
We're here,

5661
02:38:19,970 --> 02:38:21,520
all this stuff to Cape,

5662
02:38:21,560 --> 02:38:23,750
keep us happy and keep us occupied.

5663
02:38:23,751 --> 02:38:24,710
Calculator watches,

5664
02:38:24,870 --> 02:38:25,541
you know,

5665
02:38:25,541 --> 02:38:25,750
uh,

5666
02:38:25,750 --> 02:38:26,610
cell phones,

5667
02:38:26,810 --> 02:38:29,490
they tons of,

5668
02:38:29,491 --> 02:38:30,000
uh,

5669
02:38:30,000 --> 02:38:30,571
you know,

5670
02:38:30,571 --> 02:38:32,730
things that occupy our time.

5671
02:38:33,130 --> 02:38:33,480
There are,

5672
02:38:33,480 --> 02:38:35,740
there are things that occupy
our time in a negative way.

5673
02:38:35,741 --> 02:38:36,190
They can,

5674
02:38:36,190 --> 02:38:37,210
they can take your time away,

5675
02:38:37,211 --> 02:38:39,250
but they also give you the
opportunity to do things.

5676
02:38:39,251 --> 02:38:41,620
It's up to you to decide
what you do with your time.

5677
02:38:41,680 --> 02:38:42,610
Exactly.

5678
02:38:42,980 --> 02:38:44,030
That's that thing again.

5679
02:38:44,230 --> 02:38:44,960
So they said,

5680
02:38:44,960 --> 02:38:45,141
oh,

5681
02:38:45,141 --> 02:38:46,190
it's bad to be selfish.

5682
02:38:46,191 --> 02:38:46,520
And I think,

5683
02:38:46,520 --> 02:38:46,671
oh,

5684
02:38:46,671 --> 02:38:47,121
it's not,

5685
02:38:47,121 --> 02:38:49,880
because if you're conservative
yourself and what you're up to,

5686
02:38:50,180 --> 02:38:50,440
your,

5687
02:38:50,440 --> 02:38:54,080
you turned out to be a better product
for the other people around you and say,

5688
02:38:54,110 --> 02:38:54,561
Oh wow,

5689
02:38:54,561 --> 02:38:56,840
this guy's actually spent
some time with himself.

5690
02:38:57,440 --> 02:38:58,273
Yeah.

5691
02:38:58,450 --> 02:38:59,450
It's a weird word though,

5692
02:38:59,451 --> 02:39:00,690
because when I think of southwest,

5693
02:39:00,710 --> 02:39:01,401
I think of like,

5694
02:39:01,401 --> 02:39:01,571
you know,

5695
02:39:01,571 --> 02:39:02,404
like greedy,

5696
02:39:02,450 --> 02:39:02,881
like Yo,

5697
02:39:02,881 --> 02:39:03,141
you know,

5698
02:39:03,141 --> 02:39:06,080
those movies where like people are trapped
somewhere and it turns out one dude's

5699
02:39:06,081 --> 02:39:07,940
been hogging all the
food and lying about it.

5700
02:39:08,060 --> 02:39:09,230
That's kind of selfish.

5701
02:39:09,231 --> 02:39:09,580
Fuck.

5702
02:39:09,580 --> 02:39:10,710
That's the way they present.

5703
02:39:10,770 --> 02:39:11,310
Right.

5704
02:39:11,310 --> 02:39:11,480
So,

5705
02:39:11,480 --> 02:39:11,931
you know what I mean?

5706
02:39:11,931 --> 02:39:12,800
You hear about that guy,

5707
02:39:12,820 --> 02:39:15,440
he like you dick or one
guy like shuts the door.

5708
02:39:15,441 --> 02:39:15,681
You know,

5709
02:39:15,681 --> 02:39:15,801
like,

5710
02:39:15,801 --> 02:39:16,161
stop,

5711
02:39:16,161 --> 02:39:16,994
don't shut the door.

5712
02:39:18,370 --> 02:39:19,203
He runs away.

5713
02:39:19,220 --> 02:39:20,230
That Guy Selfish,

5714
02:39:20,290 --> 02:39:20,601
right?

5715
02:39:20,601 --> 02:39:21,710
That's a selfish person.

5716
02:39:21,820 --> 02:39:24,800
And then you hear the people get killed
by the monster and then you find out

5717
02:39:24,801 --> 02:39:26,120
that he shut the door
and you look you dick.

5718
02:39:26,600 --> 02:39:27,710
That's a selfish guy.

5719
02:39:28,100 --> 02:39:28,580
Um,

5720
02:39:28,580 --> 02:39:33,200
but there's also self aware and self
awareness and concentrating on yourself.

5721
02:39:33,201 --> 02:39:35,710
And some people are uncomfortable with
other people concentrating on their

5722
02:39:35,711 --> 02:39:36,440
shelves.

5723
02:39:36,440 --> 02:39:37,191
Some people are,

5724
02:39:37,191 --> 02:39:37,730
uh,

5725
02:39:37,730 --> 02:39:40,040
they're uncomfortable with people that
are like really into their bodies.

5726
02:39:40,070 --> 02:39:42,710
They're uncomfortable with people that
are really into fitness or people that

5727
02:39:42,711 --> 02:39:43,521
are really into health.

5728
02:39:43,521 --> 02:39:43,791
They get,

5729
02:39:43,791 --> 02:39:44,571
they get upset at them,

5730
02:39:44,571 --> 02:39:45,291
they don't like it.

5731
02:39:45,291 --> 02:39:46,400
It makes them feel bad.

5732
02:39:46,620 --> 02:39:47,130
Whenever these,

5733
02:39:47,130 --> 02:39:50,030
to look at the label in the store and
you're looking at these people in a

5734
02:39:50,031 --> 02:39:52,400
shopping store and they're looking
at the label and what are they?

5735
02:39:52,460 --> 02:39:52,890
What do they,

5736
02:39:52,890 --> 02:39:53,300
was it,

5737
02:39:53,300 --> 02:39:53,811
these are words,

5738
02:39:53,811 --> 02:39:55,890
you don't even know what they mean in the,

5739
02:39:56,030 --> 02:39:56,271
you know,

5740
02:39:56,271 --> 02:39:58,730
many years ago now everybody knows.

5741
02:39:58,731 --> 02:40:00,110
Everybody's now looking at it,

5742
02:40:00,111 --> 02:40:01,280
high fructose corn syrup.

5743
02:40:01,281 --> 02:40:01,820
Look at that.

5744
02:40:01,820 --> 02:40:02,810
Times have changed.

5745
02:40:02,811 --> 02:40:07,010
You know how many times an
ingredient and La fucking know.

5746
02:40:07,430 --> 02:40:08,241
I can't say it.

5747
02:40:08,241 --> 02:40:09,140
I'm not going to eat it.

5748
02:40:09,170 --> 02:40:09,380
You know,

5749
02:40:09,380 --> 02:40:10,850
I can't even read what this stuff is.

5750
02:40:10,851 --> 02:40:12,170
I'm not going to put it in my mouth.

5751
02:40:12,170 --> 02:40:13,010
I mean what are you kidding?

5752
02:40:13,290 --> 02:40:15,480
You know what I started looking at
recently that I never looked at before?

5753
02:40:15,481 --> 02:40:17,070
Grams of sugar in drinks,

5754
02:40:17,400 --> 02:40:19,050
like grams of sugar and like,

5755
02:40:19,260 --> 02:40:20,970
like a a sports drink.

5756
02:40:21,000 --> 02:40:22,290
One of those sports drinks type things.

5757
02:40:23,880 --> 02:40:24,470
It's crazy.

5758
02:40:24,470 --> 02:40:26,610
So it's like more sugar than
he's supposed to have in a day.

5759
02:40:26,800 --> 02:40:27,631
Is it sugar?

5760
02:40:27,631 --> 02:40:28,410
Even now,

5761
02:40:28,410 --> 02:40:31,600
the sensor from the beats and
there's this stuff from the corns.

5762
02:40:32,150 --> 02:40:32,380
Yeah,

5763
02:40:32,380 --> 02:40:32,971
beet sugar.

5764
02:40:32,971 --> 02:40:33,740
You know the sugar.

5765
02:40:33,740 --> 02:40:34,250
Yeah.

5766
02:40:34,250 --> 02:40:35,190
It's sounds good.

5767
02:40:35,540 --> 02:40:36,690
Well that's good.

5768
02:40:36,691 --> 02:40:39,780
I think that they're supposed to
have been modified or something.

5769
02:40:39,781 --> 02:40:40,410
I don't know.

5770
02:40:40,410 --> 02:40:41,243
Once again,

5771
02:40:42,180 --> 02:40:42,900
chem trails.

5772
02:40:42,900 --> 02:40:43,500
Yeah.

5773
02:40:43,500 --> 02:40:45,840
I tried not to get too
upset by all of this,

5774
02:40:45,841 --> 02:40:47,700
but try to like when you buy the sugar,

5775
02:40:47,701 --> 02:40:49,840
get the cane sugar organic cane,

5776
02:40:49,870 --> 02:40:50,703
is it?

5777
02:40:50,850 --> 02:40:51,570
That's what the labels,

5778
02:40:51,570 --> 02:40:53,310
now that I understand that,

5779
02:40:53,690 --> 02:40:56,460
I know labels body doesn't
want sugar like that.

5780
02:40:56,750 --> 02:40:56,961
I mean,

5781
02:40:56,961 --> 02:40:59,760
you can have it in cookies and you can
have it in cakes and you can have it in

5782
02:40:59,761 --> 02:41:01,050
moderation and you'll be fine,

5783
02:41:01,320 --> 02:41:03,120
but your body doesn't want it like that.

5784
02:41:03,121 --> 02:41:05,520
Your body wants sugar
that's attached to foods.

5785
02:41:06,060 --> 02:41:07,280
There's a lot of yummy stuff.

5786
02:41:07,330 --> 02:41:09,060
That stuff I love.

5787
02:41:09,330 --> 02:41:10,650
Oranges didn't exist.

5788
02:41:10,710 --> 02:41:11,101
Okay.

5789
02:41:11,101 --> 02:41:13,620
If they didn't exist and
he had to go to some plays,

5790
02:41:13,710 --> 02:41:15,210
crazy exotic location,

5791
02:41:15,250 --> 02:41:16,083
find an orange,

5792
02:41:16,200 --> 02:41:20,340
like a real good ripe Florida orange
when it was big plump ones with it's easy

5793
02:41:20,341 --> 02:41:22,350
to peel and he piped into
that as fuck and you're like,

5794
02:41:22,410 --> 02:41:22,781
oh,

5795
02:41:22,781 --> 02:41:23,614
it's so delicious.

5796
02:41:23,700 --> 02:41:25,560
It would be an extreme luxury.

5797
02:41:25,620 --> 02:41:27,300
It's so much better than caviar.

5798
02:41:27,720 --> 02:41:29,280
It's just caviars hard to get.

5799
02:41:29,400 --> 02:41:31,680
But caviar tastes like dog shit.

5800
02:41:31,890 --> 02:41:32,580
It's grow.

5801
02:41:32,580 --> 02:41:33,510
It's an acquired taste.

5802
02:41:33,630 --> 02:41:37,020
No one needs an acquired taste
for oranges are delicious.

5803
02:41:37,420 --> 02:41:38,340
You like caviar,

5804
02:41:38,790 --> 02:41:39,840
you're one of those motherfuckers.

5805
02:41:39,900 --> 02:41:42,240
I used to live with them
Russian people and I got a,

5806
02:41:42,450 --> 02:41:43,620
you acquired the taste.

5807
02:41:43,621 --> 02:41:44,850
I did acquire the taste,

5808
02:41:44,910 --> 02:41:45,743
but uh,

5809
02:41:45,990 --> 02:41:46,823
it is,

5810
02:41:46,900 --> 02:41:47,940
I can appreciate the,

5811
02:41:47,960 --> 02:41:48,793
uh,

5812
02:41:49,110 --> 02:41:49,950
nothing wrong with it.

5813
02:41:49,951 --> 02:41:53,310
But my point is the old
orange is right there.

5814
02:41:53,340 --> 02:41:54,030
Perfect.

5815
02:41:54,030 --> 02:41:54,863
Delicious.

5816
02:41:55,020 --> 02:41:55,853
Different.

5817
02:41:56,070 --> 02:41:56,610
I get it.

5818
02:41:56,610 --> 02:41:58,720
It's a sophisticated
palate that represents,

5819
02:41:58,721 --> 02:42:01,440
is recognize the subtleties of all caviar.

5820
02:42:02,340 --> 02:42:05,430
Caviar is from a very
particular type of sturgeon.

5821
02:42:06,270 --> 02:42:07,830
I can't even tell if it's greed.

5822
02:42:07,860 --> 02:42:10,320
I mean if it's black or
the red or whatever is a,

5823
02:42:10,330 --> 02:42:12,720
it's all tastes kind of like
the same dummy stock shit.

5824
02:42:12,740 --> 02:42:13,573
It's like wine.

5825
02:42:13,920 --> 02:42:14,700
I never used to.

5826
02:42:14,700 --> 02:42:16,380
I know like I can't really
tell the difference.

5827
02:42:16,410 --> 02:42:18,030
Oh this tastes like a wine,

5828
02:42:18,031 --> 02:42:18,580
you know,

5829
02:42:18,580 --> 02:42:20,370
he's good one like wanting to taste good.

5830
02:42:20,371 --> 02:42:21,204
I just don't,

5831
02:42:21,270 --> 02:42:24,510
it's a good to a Somalia
that is a real job.

5832
02:42:24,600 --> 02:42:27,630
Like someone who actually understands
why I let the guys who are really good at

5833
02:42:27,631 --> 02:42:27,751
it,

5834
02:42:27,751 --> 02:42:28,321
they really,

5835
02:42:28,321 --> 02:42:29,160
it really is an art.

5836
02:42:29,340 --> 02:42:30,750
It's weird out and stuff.

5837
02:42:30,751 --> 02:42:31,950
They don't even swallow it this.

5838
02:42:31,960 --> 02:42:36,220
Otherwise they'd get fucked up if they
could tell what it is by swirling and or

5839
02:42:36,300 --> 02:42:37,630
somehow in their mouth they,

5840
02:42:38,000 --> 02:42:38,340
yeah,

5841
02:42:38,340 --> 02:42:41,940
well that you still get drunk but you
get drunk less quick than if you drink it

5842
02:42:41,941 --> 02:42:42,450
all,

5843
02:42:42,450 --> 02:42:42,850
you know,

5844
02:42:42,850 --> 02:42:44,490
it tastes good and your tongue,

5845
02:42:44,620 --> 02:42:45,453
and again,

5846
02:42:46,050 --> 02:42:47,100
some of them drink it though.

5847
02:42:47,160 --> 02:42:50,730
They just go old school and get that
fucking Orson Welles potbelly and keep

5848
02:42:50,731 --> 02:42:55,731
rocking it and can keep it in Sonoma
hard every year fucking pound that.

5849
02:42:56,430 --> 02:42:57,870
That's Santa Ynez wine.

5850
02:42:58,280 --> 02:42:58,590
Yeah.

5851
02:42:58,590 --> 02:42:59,430
I never gone on one of those.

5852
02:42:59,750 --> 02:43:00,583
Um,

5853
02:43:00,630 --> 02:43:01,890
those wine tasting points.

5854
02:43:01,891 --> 02:43:02,071
Yes,

5855
02:43:02,071 --> 02:43:02,400
exactly.

5856
02:43:02,400 --> 02:43:02,840
Brian's,

5857
02:43:02,840 --> 02:43:03,673
it's great.

5858
02:43:03,780 --> 02:43:04,380
It's fun.

5859
02:43:04,380 --> 02:43:07,800
I don't want to be around a bunch of
stinky drunks pretending to be cultured

5860
02:43:07,980 --> 02:43:09,150
wherein you fucking boat shoes.

5861
02:43:09,151 --> 02:43:11,860
Get away from me dudes with those

5862
02:43:12,070 --> 02:43:12,851
moccasins,

5863
02:43:12,851 --> 02:43:13,630
with the fucking,

5864
02:43:13,630 --> 02:43:18,630
those weird yellow shoe
laces in their moccasins.

5865
02:43:19,320 --> 02:43:19,931
Get out of here man.

5866
02:43:19,931 --> 02:43:21,190
I know he jokes and yeah,

5867
02:43:21,191 --> 02:43:21,790
exactly.

5868
02:43:21,790 --> 02:43:22,623
Those weird things.

5869
02:43:22,840 --> 02:43:23,530
I know what you're doing.

5870
02:43:23,530 --> 02:43:25,990
Get asked to do gigs down
there at the Gainey winery.

5871
02:43:26,080 --> 02:43:27,100
Gainey want you heard of that?

5872
02:43:27,310 --> 02:43:27,940
Gigs?

5873
02:43:27,940 --> 02:43:29,380
Abandoned it shows.

5874
02:43:29,660 --> 02:43:30,493
Yeah.

5875
02:43:30,670 --> 02:43:31,510
Gainey winery.

5876
02:43:31,780 --> 02:43:32,920
They have gigs at a winery.

5877
02:43:32,930 --> 02:43:33,400
Yeah.

5878
02:43:33,400 --> 02:43:33,821
Outside.

5879
02:43:33,821 --> 02:43:34,421
It was to be fun.

5880
02:43:34,421 --> 02:43:36,190
Like a party or we're running out of time.

5881
02:43:36,220 --> 02:43:36,531
So,

5882
02:43:36,531 --> 02:43:36,880
um,

5883
02:43:36,880 --> 02:43:37,810
let's talk about,

5884
02:43:37,840 --> 02:43:38,051
uh,

5885
02:43:38,051 --> 02:43:38,320
your,

5886
02:43:38,320 --> 02:43:38,590
your,

5887
02:43:38,590 --> 02:43:41,560
your tank center and the new place
that you guys are doing and what's the

5888
02:43:41,561 --> 02:43:45,520
difference between what
you're doing and what the,

5889
02:43:45,830 --> 02:43:49,300
a lot of these commercial places
that are using these home tanks?

5890
02:43:49,720 --> 02:43:50,361
We have a,

5891
02:43:50,361 --> 02:43:51,400
there's a real problem with that,

5892
02:43:51,401 --> 02:43:51,700
right?

5893
02:43:51,700 --> 02:43:56,700
As far as like infections and far as
safety and as far as like everything needs

5894
02:43:56,801 --> 02:43:58,180
to be moved to a higher standard.

5895
02:43:58,990 --> 02:44:02,020
That's a certainly our
opinion of the situation.

5896
02:44:02,021 --> 02:44:02,321
You know,

5897
02:44:02,321 --> 02:44:02,530
we,

5898
02:44:02,530 --> 02:44:03,550
we've been working with,

5899
02:44:03,580 --> 02:44:03,931
you know,

5900
02:44:03,931 --> 02:44:07,130
like with the NSF and the other state
and local authorities tend to uh,

5901
02:44:07,840 --> 02:44:12,760
get in tune with what's required as
far as rules and regulations as far as

5902
02:44:12,761 --> 02:44:13,810
testing the water.

5903
02:44:13,811 --> 02:44:15,670
And that's our certification.

5904
02:44:15,730 --> 02:44:16,960
We've been certified for that.

5905
02:44:17,040 --> 02:44:18,940
Whichever three log kill what they call,

5906
02:44:18,941 --> 02:44:22,810
which said 99.9 of all the microorganisms
that are in fact they in fact the

5907
02:44:22,811 --> 02:44:23,644
water.

5908
02:44:23,680 --> 02:44:26,590
Then they see how long it takes
to eradicate this infection.

5909
02:44:26,680 --> 02:44:29,320
And obviously this is a big difference
between someone who just has one that's

5910
02:44:29,321 --> 02:44:30,160
only for them,

5911
02:44:30,190 --> 02:44:31,570
only for their own personal use,

5912
02:44:31,840 --> 02:44:35,320
which is like a lot of these more low
end ones and someone who is running a

5913
02:44:35,321 --> 02:44:38,260
commercial business sort of like the
difference between your home pool and your

5914
02:44:38,261 --> 02:44:39,094
swimming pool.

5915
02:44:39,670 --> 02:44:40,660
I always like to say,

5916
02:44:40,661 --> 02:44:41,051
you know,

5917
02:44:41,051 --> 02:44:41,491
it's like,

5918
02:44:41,491 --> 02:44:41,870
uh,

5919
02:44:41,870 --> 02:44:42,520
you know,

5920
02:44:42,520 --> 02:44:44,500
opening a restaurant
with an easy bake oven,

5921
02:44:44,930 --> 02:44:45,190
you know,

5922
02:44:45,190 --> 02:44:48,100
it isn't appropriate for appropriate.

5923
02:44:48,310 --> 02:44:50,500
This is not up to us to decide anyway.

5924
02:44:50,770 --> 02:44:55,770
All is we've had to do is adhere to these
standards and codes that have been set

5925
02:44:56,231 --> 02:45:00,910
up by realistic people that that
understand and you've helped with these,

5926
02:45:00,911 --> 02:45:02,320
the setting up the standards and codes.

5927
02:45:02,321 --> 02:45:04,000
So losing a very important thing for you.

5928
02:45:04,001 --> 02:45:04,211
Right?

5929
02:45:04,211 --> 02:45:04,931
Super important.

5930
02:45:04,931 --> 02:45:08,140
It's more important to us than
anything else is this disinfection,

5931
02:45:08,560 --> 02:45:13,560
this ability to disinfect this w the
solution correctly between usages because

5932
02:45:14,110 --> 02:45:16,270
we don't use chemicals
and we're all tested,

5933
02:45:16,690 --> 02:45:17,410
you know,

5934
02:45:17,410 --> 02:45:18,610
to do this three log,

5935
02:45:18,611 --> 02:45:20,500
we actually did a seven log in a vessel.

5936
02:45:20,680 --> 02:45:23,230
The vessel itself generally
contaminates the specimen,

5937
02:45:23,231 --> 02:45:26,920
but we have such a small body of water
in such an intense system there of

5938
02:45:26,921 --> 02:45:27,930
cleaning that uh,

5939
02:45:28,270 --> 02:45:32,710
they tested the material in the vessel
and we still got the three log and then

5940
02:45:32,711 --> 02:45:33,610
surpass that.

5941
02:45:34,000 --> 02:45:37,150
But that's within one cleaning cycle
without any of the use of chemicals.

5942
02:45:37,360 --> 02:45:38,740
The problem with chemicals now,

5943
02:45:38,741 --> 02:45:41,410
which is what everybody else has to
do due to the fact that they don't or

5944
02:45:41,411 --> 02:45:44,980
unwilling to spend the money
on the disinfection process,

5945
02:45:44,981 --> 02:45:49,960
which is this I told you about this UV
lights like nine grand if 7,500 for the

5946
02:45:49,990 --> 02:45:50,741
generators.

5947
02:45:50,741 --> 02:45:53,170
And so it's a lot of
bread to get it right man.

5948
02:45:53,171 --> 02:45:53,381
You know,

5949
02:45:53,381 --> 02:45:54,860
and the electrical stuff,

5950
02:45:54,861 --> 02:45:56,470
see our UL listing as well.

5951
02:45:56,650 --> 02:45:57,760
Underwriters Laboratory,

5952
02:45:57,761 --> 02:46:00,400
this is electricity and people,

5953
02:46:00,430 --> 02:46:02,320
you're in a water and electricity,

5954
02:46:02,560 --> 02:46:02,951
you can't,

5955
02:46:02,951 --> 02:46:03,440
you know,

5956
02:46:03,440 --> 02:46:04,030
Eh,

5957
02:46:04,030 --> 02:46:07,300
scooter McGee said it's okay
or shifty Williams over here.

5958
02:46:09,740 --> 02:46:10,190
Who are these

5959
02:46:10,190 --> 02:46:10,660
people?

5960
02:46:10,660 --> 02:46:12,830
Where would it makes them
under looking shifty,

5961
02:46:13,070 --> 02:46:13,691
fucking shift.

5962
02:46:13,691 --> 02:46:14,660
He's got us before,

5963
02:46:14,661 --> 02:46:14,950
you know,

5964
02:46:14,950 --> 02:46:16,160
I mean we've heard his story,

5965
02:46:16,161 --> 02:46:18,320
but the facts are the facts.

5966
02:46:18,321 --> 02:46:23,310
You need to go into a laboratory and
evaluate the situation correctly.

5967
02:46:23,311 --> 02:46:24,160
We utilizing,

5968
02:46:24,420 --> 02:46:24,680
uh,

5969
02:46:24,680 --> 02:46:25,280
you know,

5970
02:46:25,280 --> 02:46:25,550
uh,

5971
02:46:25,550 --> 02:46:27,700
methods of that are there ethical,

5972
02:46:27,710 --> 02:46:27,981
not,

5973
02:46:27,981 --> 02:46:28,814
not

5974
02:46:29,810 --> 02:46:30,650
pouring this,

5975
02:46:30,651 --> 02:46:31,160
uh,

5976
02:46:31,160 --> 02:46:31,971
chemicals,

5977
02:46:31,971 --> 02:46:35,780
the chlorine and bromine and or whatever
it is you're pointing as a breaking

5978
02:46:35,781 --> 02:46:36,201
down.

5979
02:46:36,201 --> 02:46:37,130
Now this,

5980
02:46:37,131 --> 02:46:40,880
this material and then creating
a biproduct is biproduct.

5981
02:46:40,881 --> 02:46:41,930
Then you know,

5982
02:46:41,931 --> 02:46:45,200
you're getting in there with it and
you're sweating or pissing or spinning or

5983
02:46:45,201 --> 02:46:47,090
whatever and then you're
mixing you with this,

5984
02:46:47,130 --> 02:46:47,471
you know,

5985
02:46:47,471 --> 02:46:48,710
the ammonia nitrogen

5986
02:46:49,330 --> 02:46:50,011
more of an issue with,

5987
02:46:50,011 --> 02:46:51,120
when I talked to him about the tank,

5988
02:46:51,150 --> 02:46:51,871
they always say that like,

5989
02:46:51,871 --> 02:46:53,480
I'm going to get in the water
that someone else has been in

5990
02:46:53,840 --> 02:46:54,501
fucking weird.

5991
02:46:54,501 --> 02:46:55,760
It should have an issue with it.

5992
02:46:55,761 --> 02:46:56,870
There is an issue with it.

5993
02:46:56,890 --> 02:46:57,723
It is like,

5994
02:46:57,800 --> 02:46:58,041
you know,

5995
02:46:58,041 --> 02:47:00,050
if these things are not
dealt with properly,

5996
02:47:00,051 --> 02:47:00,680
they're there,

5997
02:47:00,680 --> 02:47:01,100
you know,

5998
02:47:01,100 --> 02:47:02,750
it's an infestation

5999
02:47:03,280 --> 02:47:05,510
and as the popularity these things grows,

6000
02:47:05,540 --> 02:47:08,630
this is something we really need to
consider because this is something that

6001
02:47:08,631 --> 02:47:10,400
could become an issue for some folks.

6002
02:47:10,610 --> 02:47:12,810
And I know that you're very
conscientious about this.

6003
02:47:12,811 --> 02:47:15,740
This is very important to you and this
is like one of the main focuses of

6004
02:47:15,741 --> 02:47:17,360
conversation that we've
had over the years,

6005
02:47:17,361 --> 02:47:18,290
is about this,

6006
02:47:18,380 --> 02:47:22,040
this need to make sure that everything
is like at the same standards of the

6007
02:47:22,041 --> 02:47:22,874
tanks that you have.

6008
02:47:22,960 --> 02:47:27,250
It's important for the people that
are doing this to have a product,

6009
02:47:27,251 --> 02:47:31,840
then that is a credible that
has been designed correctly,

6010
02:47:31,841 --> 02:47:34,630
that's had a lot of time
and effort spent to uh,

6011
02:47:35,170 --> 02:47:39,340
to verify how it actually
works and what it does and now,

6012
02:47:39,341 --> 02:47:39,930
and then,

6013
02:47:39,930 --> 02:47:40,290
uh,

6014
02:47:40,290 --> 02:47:41,030
does all the harm,

6015
02:47:41,030 --> 02:47:42,250
all the good and none of the harm.

6016
02:47:42,280 --> 02:47:42,730
Right.

6017
02:47:42,730 --> 02:47:44,140
And it's all the potential harm out,

6018
02:47:44,170 --> 02:47:47,070
all checked out and
know and documented and,

6019
02:47:47,071 --> 02:47:47,340
and,

6020
02:47:47,340 --> 02:47:49,030
and then like I said,

6021
02:47:49,031 --> 02:47:50,440
this is new one UL stuff too.

6022
02:47:50,441 --> 02:47:51,274
The amount of,

6023
02:47:52,620 --> 02:47:53,090
you know,

6024
02:47:53,090 --> 02:47:56,980
adjustments that we've had to do with
the electrical aspects of these thing are

6025
02:47:56,981 --> 02:47:57,814
tremendous,

6026
02:47:57,820 --> 02:47:58,470
you know,

6027
02:47:58,470 --> 02:47:59,370
but it,

6028
02:47:59,470 --> 02:48:00,190
by the time we're all,

6029
02:48:00,190 --> 02:48:00,941
we've been working with them,

6030
02:48:00,941 --> 02:48:01,271
whatnot,

6031
02:48:01,271 --> 02:48:03,940
four years with NSF to try to,

6032
02:48:03,941 --> 02:48:04,720
uh,

6033
02:48:04,720 --> 02:48:07,270
established these guidelines then for,

6034
02:48:07,690 --> 02:48:08,230
you know,

6035
02:48:08,230 --> 02:48:09,063
uh,

6036
02:48:09,370 --> 02:48:10,270
effective,

6037
02:48:10,450 --> 02:48:11,283
uh,

6038
02:48:11,290 --> 02:48:12,040
purification.

6039
02:48:12,040 --> 02:48:12,611
Yes,

6040
02:48:12,611 --> 02:48:14,320
too for people then to do this.

6041
02:48:14,321 --> 02:48:17,920
Because if you don't have it and
people come away from it with a bad,

6042
02:48:17,950 --> 02:48:18,610
you know,

6043
02:48:18,610 --> 02:48:19,990
how long is it going to last?

6044
02:48:19,991 --> 02:48:21,250
The industry,

6045
02:48:21,280 --> 02:48:21,671
you know,

6046
02:48:21,671 --> 02:48:21,831
it,

6047
02:48:21,831 --> 02:48:26,380
it needs to have guidelines and standards
set up to adhere to then to become a

6048
02:48:26,381 --> 02:48:27,214
credible,

6049
02:48:27,490 --> 02:48:27,761
you know,

6050
02:48:27,761 --> 02:48:28,460
industry.

6051
02:48:28,460 --> 02:48:28,641
Well,

6052
02:48:28,641 --> 02:48:30,290
I commend the fact also that you're,

6053
02:48:30,320 --> 02:48:30,740
you're,

6054
02:48:30,740 --> 02:48:33,350
you're meeting it head on
before it becomes a big issue.

6055
02:48:33,380 --> 02:48:36,170
Like there's not a lot of people that
are reporting like infections and lot a

6056
02:48:36,171 --> 02:48:38,360
lot of people that have
become sick because of it.

6057
02:48:38,990 --> 02:48:41,240
But if this industry continues to grow,

6058
02:48:41,390 --> 02:48:45,440
the potential instances of people not
taking care of the water can rise and that

6059
02:48:45,441 --> 02:48:47,080
could potentially damage there.

6060
02:48:47,090 --> 02:48:51,320
The reputation that you fought so hard
to try to let people know about the

6061
02:48:51,321 --> 02:48:53,120
positive benefits of this.

6062
02:48:53,121 --> 02:48:53,380
Me,

6063
02:48:53,380 --> 02:48:53,901
I know you,

6064
02:48:53,901 --> 02:48:55,340
you've been working on
this for a long time,

6065
02:48:55,341 --> 02:48:56,040
man.

6066
02:48:56,040 --> 02:48:57,110
It's catching on now,

6067
02:48:57,111 --> 02:48:57,540
right?

6068
02:48:57,540 --> 02:48:57,930
Yeah.

6069
02:48:57,930 --> 02:48:58,171
It's,

6070
02:48:58,171 --> 02:48:58,440
you know,

6071
02:48:58,440 --> 02:48:58,591
it's,

6072
02:48:58,591 --> 02:48:58,911
it's,

6073
02:48:58,911 --> 02:48:59,131
it's,

6074
02:48:59,131 --> 02:49:01,380
it's been something I've
been dedicated to with,

6075
02:49:01,530 --> 02:49:02,280
you know,

6076
02:49:02,280 --> 02:49:03,113
all of my,

6077
02:49:03,750 --> 02:49:04,650
everything I have,

6078
02:49:04,680 --> 02:49:05,100
you know,

6079
02:49:05,100 --> 02:49:07,530
it's been involved in trying to get right.

6080
02:49:08,000 --> 02:49:08,450
Cause it's,

6081
02:49:08,450 --> 02:49:09,420
it's important,

6082
02:49:09,480 --> 02:49:09,871
you know,

6083
02:49:09,871 --> 02:49:10,320
that,

6084
02:49:10,320 --> 02:49:11,153
uh,

6085
02:49:11,160 --> 02:49:13,920
that this technology is
not overlooked right now.

6086
02:49:13,950 --> 02:49:14,940
We need to get ahold.

6087
02:49:15,150 --> 02:49:15,760
You seen if it,

6088
02:49:15,760 --> 02:49:19,000
if it's set up with these little
Mickey mouse second rate rigs,

6089
02:49:19,450 --> 02:49:21,090
the authorities are not going to,

6090
02:49:21,091 --> 02:49:21,720
okay.

6091
02:49:21,720 --> 02:49:23,220
They're not going to allow it.

6092
02:49:23,250 --> 02:49:23,851
We've already been,

6093
02:49:23,851 --> 02:49:24,870
but they allow it right now.

6094
02:49:25,280 --> 02:49:26,370
Now it's unregulated.

6095
02:49:26,390 --> 02:49:26,681
Okay,

6096
02:49:26,681 --> 02:49:28,280
so it's going to eventually be regular.

6097
02:49:28,490 --> 02:49:29,040
So low.

6098
02:49:29,040 --> 02:49:29,850
That's what this,

6099
02:49:29,850 --> 02:49:30,720
we showed you this,

6100
02:49:30,840 --> 02:49:31,160
right?

6101
02:49:31,160 --> 02:49:31,501
Well I know,

6102
02:49:31,501 --> 02:49:33,030
but people that are listening,

6103
02:49:33,270 --> 02:49:34,530
when is this all going to take place?

6104
02:49:34,560 --> 02:49:35,550
It's happening now.

6105
02:49:35,551 --> 02:49:36,010
We were on,

6106
02:49:36,010 --> 02:49:39,780
we have a task group that's been formed
with both the Canadian Ministry of

6107
02:49:39,780 --> 02:49:43,710
Health and several health and safety
officials here in this country.

6108
02:49:43,980 --> 02:49:48,480
Statewise local ys and NSF national
sanitization foundation to set up these

6109
02:49:48,481 --> 02:49:49,314
guidelines.

6110
02:49:49,380 --> 02:49:53,790
So they're realizing that this industry
growing and they're stepping in.

6111
02:49:53,820 --> 02:49:54,630
Absolutely.

6112
02:49:54,630 --> 02:49:55,261
Absolutely.

6113
02:49:55,261 --> 02:49:55,891
We were at a,

6114
02:49:55,891 --> 02:49:56,630
uh,

6115
02:49:56,630 --> 02:49:57,900
a a task group.

6116
02:49:58,080 --> 02:49:58,950
What was that thing called?

6117
02:49:58,951 --> 02:49:59,784
The,

6118
02:50:00,750 --> 02:50:04,950
we went to a thing and they
had callers calling in.

6119
02:50:04,951 --> 02:50:08,220
It was the most asked about subject,

6120
02:50:08,221 --> 02:50:10,590
a topic that they had
conversated about at this,

6121
02:50:10,591 --> 02:50:11,850
it was called a task.

6122
02:50:11,880 --> 02:50:12,720
What was the meeting call?

6123
02:50:12,730 --> 02:50:16,180
Do you think that it's possible for you
to make two different tanks to make a

6124
02:50:16,181 --> 02:50:21,181
commercial fully sanitize unit and make
a unit for the home that's less complex

6125
02:50:21,610 --> 02:50:22,660
and more affordable?

6126
02:50:22,710 --> 02:50:25,860
We see what you were thinking about that
because naturally that would be a good

6127
02:50:25,861 --> 02:50:26,930
business sense.

6128
02:50:26,940 --> 02:50:28,860
But we got back to the point again,

6129
02:50:28,861 --> 02:50:31,110
it's like in order to do it right,

6130
02:50:31,230 --> 02:50:32,370
this is what it costs.

6131
02:50:32,371 --> 02:50:32,671
I mean,

6132
02:50:32,671 --> 02:50:34,650
we could make it Mickey mouse or whatever,

6133
02:50:34,830 --> 02:50:36,600
but is it Mickey mouse for the consumer?

6134
02:50:36,601 --> 02:50:39,480
Like say if it's just you a
quick crash lives by himself,

6135
02:50:39,481 --> 02:50:39,831
crashed,

6136
02:50:39,831 --> 02:50:41,160
loves to do the isolation tank,

6137
02:50:41,580 --> 02:50:43,440
not gonna jerk off or penis tank.

6138
02:50:43,650 --> 02:50:44,401
Or if I do,

6139
02:50:44,401 --> 02:50:45,570
I'll be in there with myself.

6140
02:50:46,540 --> 02:50:46,700
I,

6141
02:50:46,700 --> 02:50:47,241
you know what I mean?

6142
02:50:47,241 --> 02:50:48,074
It's like,

6143
02:50:48,910 --> 02:50:49,190
yeah,

6144
02:50:49,190 --> 02:50:49,910
he's right.

6145
02:50:49,910 --> 02:50:53,180
But if you're going into some place
and it's these people in those,

6146
02:50:53,290 --> 02:50:53,901
it's not,

6147
02:50:53,901 --> 02:50:54,670
you know,

6148
02:50:54,670 --> 02:50:58,610
and then what's happening then
what we were doing was trying to,

6149
02:50:58,640 --> 02:50:59,330
you know,

6150
02:50:59,330 --> 02:50:59,990
people,

6151
02:50:59,990 --> 02:51:00,823
they're cheap,

6152
02:51:00,950 --> 02:51:01,510
so they're gonna,

6153
02:51:01,510 --> 02:51:01,781
oh,

6154
02:51:01,781 --> 02:51:06,670
I'll buy it while people are broke to
fucking super expensive to buy one of

6155
02:51:06,680 --> 02:51:07,060
those.

6156
02:51:07,060 --> 02:51:07,893
That's correct.

6157
02:51:08,320 --> 02:51:13,060
I know that the equipment is really
costly and it's really high end,

6158
02:51:13,270 --> 02:51:15,820
but all I'm trying to say is with
our last five minutes of time,

6159
02:51:15,821 --> 02:51:16,870
before we turn into a Pumpkin,

6160
02:51:17,080 --> 02:51:17,913
all I'm trying to say is,

6161
02:51:17,920 --> 02:51:20,090
is it possible that it's,

6162
02:51:20,160 --> 02:51:22,600
it could be made into a consumer unit.

6163
02:51:22,800 --> 02:51:23,251
Yes,

6164
02:51:23,251 --> 02:51:23,671
it would be.

6165
02:51:23,671 --> 02:51:28,671
But back to the liability in order to
get this right and not harm anybody,

6166
02:51:29,011 --> 02:51:29,950
buy this con,

6167
02:51:30,030 --> 02:51:30,331
you know,

6168
02:51:30,331 --> 02:51:31,200
different things.

6169
02:51:31,390 --> 02:51:31,630
It's,

6170
02:51:31,630 --> 02:51:31,970
it's,

6171
02:51:31,970 --> 02:51:33,120
it's not easy.

6172
02:51:33,150 --> 02:51:34,200
Like he's telling you

6173
02:51:34,320 --> 02:51:36,360
how much more do you have
to say about this stuff?

6174
02:51:36,361 --> 02:51:38,820
Do you want to do another hour when
to shut this off and do another hour?

6175
02:51:39,420 --> 02:51:40,010
You know,

6176
02:51:40,010 --> 02:51:42,060
do you cool to talk about this
or are you running out of gas?

6177
02:51:42,090 --> 02:51:43,200
I'm not running out of gas.

6178
02:51:43,201 --> 02:51:44,100
I don't run out of gas.

6179
02:51:44,110 --> 02:51:44,760
Okay.

6180
02:51:44,760 --> 02:51:45,900
Let's just wrap this up because this is,

6181
02:51:45,901 --> 02:51:46,770
we're running out of time,

6182
02:51:47,060 --> 02:51:47,761
so we'll wrap this up.

6183
02:51:47,761 --> 02:51:49,500
We'll be right back in
about 10 more minutes.

6184
02:51:49,620 --> 02:51:51,540
So I have nine minutes.

6185
02:51:52,120 --> 02:51:53,220
I was giving you an extra,

6186
02:51:54,160 --> 02:51:54,961
an extra five minutes.

6187
02:51:54,961 --> 02:51:55,561
We'll wrap it up.

6188
02:51:55,561 --> 02:51:56,790
We'll wrap it up and
we'll come right back.

6189
02:51:57,240 --> 02:51:57,660
All right.

6190
02:51:57,660 --> 02:51:58,081
Um,

6191
02:51:58,081 --> 02:51:58,651
so,

6192
02:51:58,651 --> 02:51:58,890
uh,

6193
02:51:58,890 --> 02:52:00,330
thanks to uh,

6194
02:52:00,331 --> 02:52:01,590
on at.com go to o,

6195
02:52:01,591 --> 02:52:05,800
n n I t use the Codeword Rogan and
save 10% off any and all supplements.

6196
02:52:06,040 --> 02:52:06,873
I just want to give us,

6197
02:52:06,910 --> 02:52:10,930
give you a chance to go into a lot of
these issues that we talked about before.

6198
02:52:11,170 --> 02:52:12,580
So we'll be right back with crash.

6199
02:52:12,610 --> 02:52:14,080
It probably won't be a full podcast,

6200
02:52:14,081 --> 02:52:16,570
but it'll probably be like 40 minutes.

6201
02:52:17,170 --> 02:52:18,040
That's what I recommend.

6202
02:52:18,430 --> 02:52:19,690
I recommend another 40 minutes.

6203
02:52:19,960 --> 02:52:20,440
I'll be right back.
