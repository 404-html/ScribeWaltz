1
00:00:02,310 --> 00:00:07,110
Four, three, two, one

2
00:00:10,010 --> 00:00:14,720
David. So first of all, thanks for doing
this. Oh my pleasure. And it looks at it.

3
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:17,510
How much trouble are we
in? Legitimately? I mean,

4
00:00:17,511 --> 00:00:21,590
it's pretty bad already and it's going
to get, I think a lot, lot worse.

5
00:00:21,650 --> 00:00:25,520
So it's not bad right now. Right here.
It's raining. It seems nice out the hill.

6
00:00:25,530 --> 00:00:29,060
I mean, how long ago where the fires,
right, right when I got back, you waited.

7
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:31,190
It was October. Yeah, it was rough.

8
00:00:31,191 --> 00:00:35,690
But in all fairness had been evacuated
three times over the past 20 years. Yeah,

9
00:00:35,691 --> 00:00:38,930
I know the fires, uh, California's fires
are kind of interesting in that, um,

10
00:00:39,110 --> 00:00:42,230
they both seem like it's like the
future of the apocalypse. They're here,

11
00:00:42,231 --> 00:00:47,000
but also it's so familiar from
like decades of wildfires. Um,

12
00:00:47,030 --> 00:00:47,781
but you know,

13
00:00:47,781 --> 00:00:50,690
their scientific estimates that say that
they're going to get by the end of the

14
00:00:50,690 --> 00:00:54,050
century, 64 times worse. What? Yeah.

15
00:00:54,051 --> 00:00:56,450
I think that number's a little high
because that would mean more than half of

16
00:00:56,451 --> 00:01:00,950
California burning every year. But,
um, I mean it's going to get, yeah,

17
00:01:00,980 --> 00:01:02,510
it'll get,
it'll get crazy.

18
00:01:02,660 --> 00:01:07,160
And there's no way to avoid any of this
wildfire stuff. Well, I mean, you know,

19
00:01:07,190 --> 00:01:10,190
if we don't raise the
temperature of the planet then,

20
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:12,890
but is that the only thing
that's causing wildfire?

21
00:01:12,891 --> 00:01:15,590
I mean like obviously if
the temperature raises, uh,

22
00:01:15,620 --> 00:01:19,970
there's more brown dry leaves
and grass and stuff like that,

23
00:01:19,971 --> 00:01:23,060
but there's a, there's a lot of
preventative stuff you can do. I mean,

24
00:01:23,150 --> 00:01:26,300
not building in certain areas.
I mean it used to be, you know,

25
00:01:26,301 --> 00:01:28,760
the Indians who lived here
before the white people came,

26
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:32,920
did a lot of controlled burning.
They like lived among fires. And, um,

27
00:01:33,290 --> 00:01:35,900
I think that's like a probably
more responsible way to be.

28
00:01:35,901 --> 00:01:39,230
But we've now built up the whole state
so that there are all these homes that we

29
00:01:39,231 --> 00:01:41,780
don't want to burn their, all these
properties we don't want to burn.

30
00:01:42,140 --> 00:01:43,670
And when you,
um,

31
00:01:43,970 --> 00:01:47,600
when you like restrict the ability
of natural welfare's to burn,

32
00:01:47,601 --> 00:01:51,590
that means that like more Tinder gets
built over time and then, you know,

33
00:01:51,591 --> 00:01:55,760
at some point some thing lights
the match and it all burns.

34
00:01:56,540 --> 00:01:58,640
I mean, you could, you could
do more controlled fire,

35
00:01:58,641 --> 00:02:02,300
you could take more aggressive
action in terms of, um, you know,

36
00:02:02,301 --> 00:02:04,350
like spraying foam and that kind of thing.
Um,

37
00:02:04,730 --> 00:02:06,560
you could have a lot more firefighters,

38
00:02:06,830 --> 00:02:08,240
but I was just talking to a guy yesterday,

39
00:02:08,241 --> 00:02:12,290
I'm out here actually doing some reporting
on wildfires and who was saying that

40
00:02:12,291 --> 00:02:13,124
no,

41
00:02:13,490 --> 00:02:17,630
Santa Ana powered wildfire has ever been
stopped by firefighters and he was like,

42
00:02:17,631 --> 00:02:19,730
uh, environmental historian. Wow.

43
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:22,250
It's like you can hope that
the winds redirect them,

44
00:02:22,251 --> 00:02:25,100
but like the action of firefighters is
basically just spitting in the wind.

45
00:02:25,580 --> 00:02:29,050
So the action is not to stop and
it's a kind of contain it. Yeah.

46
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:32,840
As best they can and minimize
property damage. Yeah. But you know,

47
00:02:32,841 --> 00:02:36,410
it's hard because you have a lot more,
it's a lot easier to do that when, um,

48
00:02:37,460 --> 00:02:39,790
you know, if the land was
totally raw, you'd be like, oh,

49
00:02:39,990 --> 00:02:41,930
we'll just like try to direct
the fire in this direction.

50
00:02:41,931 --> 00:02:44,480
But if the land is like full of
homes, you're like, well we can't,

51
00:02:44,810 --> 00:02:48,400
you know what I mean? You ever seen
it live? Not a person one. Yeah.

52
00:02:49,460 --> 00:02:54,460
One time we were filming fear factor
and we were a way up on the five,

53
00:02:56,270 --> 00:03:00,850
like I'm probably would say maybe

54
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:05,880
75 miles from here and for a full
hour driving about 50 miles an hour,

55
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,360
there was fire on the right hand
side of the road for a full hour.

56
00:03:10,780 --> 00:03:15,010
I mean like Lord of the
rings end of the world,

57
00:03:15,460 --> 00:03:19,720
like you waiting for Satan to come riding
on a burning Phoenix over the top of

58
00:03:19,721 --> 00:03:22,570
the hill. It was crazy. I'd never
seen anything like it in my life.

59
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:24,910
That was the worst one I've ever seen.

60
00:03:25,270 --> 00:03:27,400
But I think that was just
because of placement.

61
00:03:27,790 --> 00:03:31,810
I think that this past one was actually
worse in terms of physical damage and

62
00:03:31,811 --> 00:03:36,280
size. It's just, I didn't see
it the way I saw this one.

63
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:38,600
Well, I, the last year there
were, there were flames,

64
00:03:38,601 --> 00:03:41,460
like hopping over the four
oh five. I mean, and that's,

65
00:03:41,870 --> 00:03:44,450
that's really like crazy to me
because, you know, I'm a New Yorker.

66
00:03:44,451 --> 00:03:47,840
I've lived my whole life in New
York and I just feel in my bones,

67
00:03:47,841 --> 00:03:49,100
I now know it's sort of not true,

68
00:03:49,101 --> 00:03:53,600
but like my inner emotional perspective
on the world is that I live in a

69
00:03:53,601 --> 00:03:56,870
fortress. I don't live in nature, right?
Like I walked down on concrete streets,

70
00:03:56,871 --> 00:03:59,060
I look up at steel buildings.
Nature can't come from me,

71
00:03:59,370 --> 00:04:03,530
but when you see like fire straddling
the four or five, that's, you know,

72
00:04:03,950 --> 00:04:06,020
this is a major metropolis here.
Um,

73
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:09,860
and we're not safe when we're
certainly not totally safe. Um,

74
00:04:10,580 --> 00:04:12,350
and that's like, for me, that's a major,

75
00:04:12,580 --> 00:04:15,020
like a major revelation I've
had is that wherever you live,

76
00:04:15,021 --> 00:04:16,940
no matter how defended
against nature you are,

77
00:04:17,300 --> 00:04:19,250
climate change is teaching us that,
you know,

78
00:04:19,940 --> 00:04:23,360
you still live within climate and when
it gets fucked up, it will fuck you up.

79
00:04:23,420 --> 00:04:24,980
It will affect you in some way.

80
00:04:25,450 --> 00:04:29,530
Yeah, there was, uh, the both sides of
the four oh five, we're on fire last year,

81
00:04:29,810 --> 00:04:34,500
last year or the year before that, one of
those. But it was insane. It was, it's,

82
00:04:34,700 --> 00:04:38,050
it was hitting bel air. And people
are like, well, this is this.

83
00:04:38,140 --> 00:04:40,990
We've never seen this before.
I talked to a firefighter once,

84
00:04:41,750 --> 00:04:45,280
and this was years ago,
and he told me with the right wind,

85
00:04:45,550 --> 00:04:47,920
it's a matter of time for a fire,

86
00:04:47,921 --> 00:04:51,280
hits the top of La and burns all
the way to the ocean. And he goes,

87
00:04:51,281 --> 00:04:53,410
and there's not gonna be anything
we could do about it. He goes,

88
00:04:53,411 --> 00:04:57,490
if the right wind catches and a fire
starts at the top of Los Angeles,

89
00:04:57,491 --> 00:05:00,550
it'll just go straight through la.
Look at this.

90
00:05:01,900 --> 00:05:06,520
What does that from Jamie or five
fire. Yeah. Okay. Oh, that's it.

91
00:05:06,700 --> 00:05:10,090
That's the crazy video.
So this is bel air and the left hand side.

92
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:15,100
And so these are people driving down
the four oh five looking at, you know,

93
00:05:15,250 --> 00:05:20,250
the most insane site for a place that
has 30 million people or whatever.

94
00:05:20,351 --> 00:05:23,770
La has to see the entire hillside on fire.

95
00:05:23,860 --> 00:05:26,710
And Bella, to me, Bella is really
interesting cause it's, you know,

96
00:05:26,711 --> 00:05:27,730
most climate impacts,

97
00:05:27,731 --> 00:05:31,750
they hit the world's poorest
first and like the wildfires are,

98
00:05:31,990 --> 00:05:35,020
they work in the reverse because it's
like people living in the hills. Um,

99
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:38,610
those are the rich people. But it just
shows you like no matter how rich you are,

100
00:05:38,630 --> 00:05:42,040
no matter how comforted by that
wealth you are like, you know,

101
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:47,000
you might get hit. Well the best
example was a point Dume yeah.

102
00:05:47,060 --> 00:05:50,540
And we were flying over it
and my friend, uh, Bill uh,

103
00:05:50,570 --> 00:05:55,570
has a helicopter license and so we
went around the peak of point Dume it's

104
00:05:56,150 --> 00:05:57,950
crazy. You know, these are like

105
00:05:58,190 --> 00:06:03,170
$20 million estates,
these massive bluff side homes.

106
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:07,940
They thought they were living in the
peak of luxury overviewing the ocean and

107
00:06:07,941 --> 00:06:12,320
like, wow, we're on top of the world. And
the fire just scorched it to the ground.

108
00:06:12,350 --> 00:06:14,990
Like that's what it looks
like now. It's so crazy. Well,

109
00:06:14,991 --> 00:06:17,000
it's really crazy because he like,
they couldn't even,

110
00:06:17,190 --> 00:06:18,110
because people have always said,

111
00:06:18,140 --> 00:06:20,900
oh well they'll protect the rich
folks that in protect these ones,

112
00:06:21,140 --> 00:06:23,560
they can't protect anybody
when it gets this crazy. Yeah.

113
00:06:23,580 --> 00:06:28,220
I think they lost more than 600
homes in Malibu alone. Yeah. I mean,

114
00:06:28,221 --> 00:06:29,600
and that's, I mean, yeah.

115
00:06:29,740 --> 00:06:32,840
And you think about Miami beach
going underwater and then it's, well,

116
00:06:32,841 --> 00:06:37,040
Miami beach is a weird one, right?
Because the ground is porous. Yeah. Yeah.

117
00:06:37,041 --> 00:06:39,170
So it's inevitable. I
mean, I'd get out of there,

118
00:06:39,230 --> 00:06:42,510
that's basically a sandbar that like
some developers and the 20th decided that

119
00:06:42,511 --> 00:06:45,710
it was, oh, we could make this into a
fake paradise. Oh, really? Yeah. I mean,

120
00:06:45,711 --> 00:06:48,380
there was, yeah, it was, I mean,
la is kind of the same way.

121
00:06:48,381 --> 00:06:50,600
Like nobody looking at La in
1850 it would have said like,

122
00:06:50,601 --> 00:06:54,950
here's a great place to build a city.
Um, but we did it anyway, like America,

123
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:57,020
and it's like imperial swagger was like,
no,

124
00:06:57,021 --> 00:07:00,890
we can create some paradise out of this
completely in his biteable land in both

125
00:07:00,891 --> 00:07:03,590
places. And then, you know, it's
just a lesson that like, you know,

126
00:07:04,250 --> 00:07:05,450
it's just a matter of time.
Well,

127
00:07:05,451 --> 00:07:08,300
the most cocky people are the people
that have those houses on stilts,

128
00:07:08,301 --> 00:07:10,120
on the water in Malibu,

129
00:07:10,121 --> 00:07:13,370
like I want is this
gonna work out for you?

130
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:18,020
Like this thing moves back and forth
over time. And it has forever. I mean,

131
00:07:18,021 --> 00:07:20,330
if you think about like the long,
long sweep of human history,

132
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:24,510
most humans settlements didn't happen on
the coast. Right? Um, like people live,

133
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:27,620
maybe they live on a river, maybe you
have like a little community on the river,

134
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:31,100
but the, you know, the last like 50
years or a hundred years we built up,

135
00:07:31,370 --> 00:07:35,080
especially in America, is so much more
on the coast and that's like, you know,

136
00:07:35,390 --> 00:07:39,080
really inviting disaster. I mean, all
of Houston, like all of that is like,

137
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:43,090
that was flood that like nature was like,
you know, it was swamp land. It was,

138
00:07:43,310 --> 00:07:44,150
and now it's,
you know,

139
00:07:44,151 --> 00:07:46,940
new suburban developments made out of
concrete and that just means more and more

140
00:07:46,941 --> 00:07:50,780
flooding. Yeah. I've been to
Houston right after floods and it's,

141
00:07:50,980 --> 00:07:53,290
Houston is a crazy one that we lost.

142
00:07:53,310 --> 00:07:56,780
There was a hotel we used to stay at
whenever I used to do gigs in Houston.

143
00:07:57,110 --> 00:08:01,430
It's gone now because the flood waters,
it just filled up the hotel so crazy.

144
00:08:02,620 --> 00:08:06,260
I actually really love that city. It's
kind of like, uh, there's great food.

145
00:08:06,350 --> 00:08:08,880
Oh yeah.
Houston's super underrated.

146
00:08:09,350 --> 00:08:14,330
It gets lumped into this weird sort of San
Antonio vibe. I don't know why, but uh,

147
00:08:14,420 --> 00:08:17,420
I'm, I'm, I'm a big fan of Houston.
I'm a big fan of Texas in general.

148
00:08:17,780 --> 00:08:21,320
They're fun people. But yeah, if
it gets hotter there, fuck too.

149
00:08:21,530 --> 00:08:24,140
Cause it's just like in the
summertime in Houston, you know,

150
00:08:24,141 --> 00:08:27,680
when you're dealing with a hundred percent
humidity and it's 115 degrees outside,

151
00:08:27,970 --> 00:08:32,210
you can't even explain to people what
that feels like. I mean cooked. There's,

152
00:08:32,300 --> 00:08:34,160
there are places in the
world that are going to be,

153
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:36,320
they're going to literally
cook you by 2050.

154
00:08:36,321 --> 00:08:39,200
So cities in India and the Middle East,

155
00:08:39,230 --> 00:08:43,490
you won't be able to go outside during
the summer without being at risk of dying

156
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:46,670
by 20, 50 by 2050. Like what kind of
temperature we talking about it? Well,

157
00:08:46,671 --> 00:08:48,950
it's a combination of heat and
humidity. So, but you know,

158
00:08:48,951 --> 00:08:52,730
usually the heat will be like up in the
up around one 30 combined with some bad

159
00:08:52,731 --> 00:08:56,070
humanity. Um, but you know, they're,
they've already been, we've already

160
00:08:56,070 --> 00:08:59,580
broken that threshold. Like there've been
temperature records set every year, but,

161
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:04,350
um, last year broke 130 in Oman, I think.
But like the scariest parts or not,

162
00:09:04,410 --> 00:09:07,440
some of these crazy desert places that
have gotten really hot. It's the cities,

163
00:09:07,730 --> 00:09:11,910
it's like Calcutta has like 12 million
people in it and it may not be able to,

164
00:09:11,911 --> 00:09:15,240
you may not be able to live there
in the summer in just 30 years.

165
00:09:16,110 --> 00:09:18,330
And then you just think about where
all those people are going and how much

166
00:09:18,331 --> 00:09:20,190
that's going to destabilize everything.

167
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:22,400
You know, I've talked to people, uh,

168
00:09:22,470 --> 00:09:27,120
who are terrified about this and I've
talked to people who are nonchalant, um,

169
00:09:27,121 --> 00:09:29,580
where, where do you sit?
Are you, are you terrified,

170
00:09:29,610 --> 00:09:34,610
you thinking that you're going to be
physically in trouble yourself or do you

171
00:09:34,891 --> 00:09:39,150
think that with proper planning and
does not being tied to one spot,

172
00:09:39,151 --> 00:09:40,560
you can move to another area?

173
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:41,320
I mean,
I have,

174
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:44,020
I have different feelings about it at
different times of day because it's that

175
00:09:44,021 --> 00:09:47,920
big a story. It's like going to affect
everything. I think. Um, you know,

176
00:09:47,921 --> 00:09:49,960
I think civilization is
not going to collapse.

177
00:09:49,961 --> 00:09:53,530
I think there'll be people around
even living like kind of rewarding,

178
00:09:53,531 --> 00:09:56,350
prosperous lives forever.

179
00:09:56,800 --> 00:10:01,510
And the question is like what shaped
those lives take and where there were,

180
00:10:01,540 --> 00:10:04,150
where they are. So me
personally, you know,

181
00:10:04,151 --> 00:10:07,420
I'm like a relatively well off
person who lives in America,

182
00:10:07,780 --> 00:10:12,640
in New York.
I think I'll be able to do okay.

183
00:10:12,641 --> 00:10:16,510
I think my children will be able to do
okay. And when I imagine their future,

184
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:21,100
I think it's a reflection of all of
our kind of like cognitive biases and

185
00:10:21,101 --> 00:10:23,710
emotional reflex is that when I
imagine like my daughter's future,

186
00:10:24,110 --> 00:10:27,220
I'm imagining a world that seems a lot
like the one that we live in today.

187
00:10:27,580 --> 00:10:31,390
But when I look at the science, um, it
paints a really, really bleak picture.

188
00:10:31,391 --> 00:10:35,200
So you know,
the question of like optimism and alarm,

189
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:37,540
I think it's really all a
matter of perspective, right?

190
00:10:37,541 --> 00:10:39,970
So we're at 1.1 degrees Celsius right now.

191
00:10:41,170 --> 00:10:43,720
I think there's basically no way
that we avoid two degrees of warming,

192
00:10:43,721 --> 00:10:48,130
which is like the UN calls,
um, catastrophic warming.

193
00:10:48,460 --> 00:10:51,790
The island nations of
the world call genocide.

194
00:10:52,150 --> 00:10:55,380
And that's when we would be making these
cities in the Middle East unlivable.

195
00:10:55,390 --> 00:10:58,090
It would mean like some ice sheets
would start a permanent collapse,

196
00:10:58,091 --> 00:11:02,890
which could all of the melted eventually
bring 260 feet of sea level rise. Um,

197
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:05,020
and we're on track for
four degrees of warming.

198
00:11:05,021 --> 00:11:10,021
So that would mean $600 trillion and
climate damages by the end of the century,

199
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:13,480
that's twice as much wealth
as exist in the world today.

200
00:11:13,900 --> 00:11:17,290
It would mean there'd be parts of the
world scientists say where you could be

201
00:11:17,291 --> 00:11:20,800
hit by six simultaneous
climate disasters at once.

202
00:11:21,190 --> 00:11:23,680
There'd be at least a few
hundred climate refugees.

203
00:11:23,681 --> 00:11:26,140
The UN says the low
investment is 200 million.

204
00:11:26,350 --> 00:11:28,240
The high end estimate is a billion,

205
00:11:28,510 --> 00:11:31,180
which is as many people as live in north
and South America compliance topic of

206
00:11:31,181 --> 00:11:36,070
resilience, six simultaneous natural
disasters at once. What does that mean?

207
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:40,330
Like flooding, hurricane,
um, famine, uh, you know,

208
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:44,950
some public health issue, um,
you know, like malaria, uh,

209
00:11:44,980 --> 00:11:49,050
it's like every, every category of modern
life can be affected by this. And um,

210
00:11:49,450 --> 00:11:51,280
there aren't that many
that could be hit by six,

211
00:11:51,281 --> 00:11:54,850
but like already right now in
Australia there was a crazy heat wave.

212
00:11:54,851 --> 00:11:57,100
It's like over 120 in lots of Australia.

213
00:11:57,250 --> 00:12:00,520
They're also dealing with like epic
floods in other parts of the country.

214
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:04,150
And that's kind of the problem
actually with wildfires in California.

215
00:12:04,151 --> 00:12:07,240
It's not just that it's getting hotter
is that it's also getting wetter.

216
00:12:07,510 --> 00:12:11,110
So the more rain means more growth
means when it gets hot again,

217
00:12:11,470 --> 00:12:16,090
that growth gets baked and then becomes,
you know, firestarter. Um, and that's a,

218
00:12:16,091 --> 00:12:18,310
you know, it's not just, um,
it's not just a temperature.

219
00:12:18,311 --> 00:12:22,540
It's like higher temperatures mean
crazier extremes in all directions.

220
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:27,730
And um, you know, that's why I
think sort of looking big picture,

221
00:12:28,300 --> 00:12:32,920
there's not a life on earth that's
going to be untouched by this force,

222
00:12:32,921 --> 00:12:33,970
like over the decades ahead.

223
00:12:34,390 --> 00:12:36,460
But that's not to say that we're
all be destroyed by it either.

224
00:12:36,461 --> 00:12:39,700
I think like we will find ways
to live and adapt and mitigate.

225
00:12:40,210 --> 00:12:43,540
It's just a question of how much
it's going to screw up our politics,

226
00:12:43,541 --> 00:12:46,930
how much it's going to change, the
way we think of history. You know,

227
00:12:46,931 --> 00:12:48,760
like I'm an end of,
I'm a nineties kid.

228
00:12:48,761 --> 00:12:51,250
I grew up end of history thinking
the world was going to get better,

229
00:12:51,251 --> 00:12:54,350
the world was going to get richer,
globalization was progress, et cetera.

230
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:58,150
What does it mean if like climate change
completely eliminates the possibility

231
00:12:58,151 --> 00:12:59,140
of economic growth,

232
00:12:59,380 --> 00:13:02,320
which probably won't be the case for
the u s but there are huge parts of the

233
00:13:02,321 --> 00:13:04,780
world that is going to be the case
that we don't change course now.

234
00:13:04,780 --> 00:13:07,840
So like at the end of the century,
if we don't change course,

235
00:13:07,900 --> 00:13:12,250
the economist studying this,
say global GDP could be at least 20,

236
00:13:12,490 --> 00:13:14,950
possibly 30% smaller than it
would be without climate change,

237
00:13:14,951 --> 00:13:17,740
30% is twice as big an impact
as the great depression.

238
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:19,570
How did you get involved in this?

239
00:13:19,571 --> 00:13:22,300
How'd you get involved in studying this
and what was your perception before you

240
00:13:22,301 --> 00:13:25,810
got involved and how did it
shift? So I'm, I'm a journalist,

241
00:13:25,811 --> 00:13:29,470
I'm an editor mostly actually at
New York magazine. Um, and you know,

242
00:13:29,471 --> 00:13:32,620
I'm interested in the near future.
Like as a result,

243
00:13:32,621 --> 00:13:34,330
read a lot of scientific papers,

244
00:13:34,331 --> 00:13:37,030
read a lot of like obscure of sub
reddits and that kind of thing.

245
00:13:37,060 --> 00:13:41,680
And I'm just in 2016 started
seeing a lot more of that.

246
00:13:41,770 --> 00:13:44,920
A lot more of the news from science was
about climate and a lot more of that

247
00:13:44,921 --> 00:13:46,510
climate news was really scary.

248
00:13:46,870 --> 00:13:49,510
And when I looked around at the other
places that like we think of as our

249
00:13:49,511 --> 00:13:51,880
competitors, you know,
newspapers, TV shows,

250
00:13:52,450 --> 00:13:56,320
I just felt like the scarier end of
the spectrum was just not at all being

251
00:13:56,321 --> 00:13:56,891
talked about.

252
00:13:56,891 --> 00:14:00,910
So most scientists talk about this two
degree threshold is like the threshold of

253
00:14:00,911 --> 00:14:01,744
catastrophe.

254
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:05,770
And I think most lay people think that
that means that that's kind of a ceiling

255
00:14:05,771 --> 00:14:07,930
for warming.
Like that'll be the worst it could get.

256
00:14:07,931 --> 00:14:10,540
But actually it's functionally
the best case scenario.

257
00:14:10,810 --> 00:14:13,510
And yet we hadn't had any storytelling,

258
00:14:13,511 --> 00:14:16,690
any discussion around what the world
would look like north of two degrees.

259
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:20,590
And I just felt as a journalist,
I was like, Holy Shit,
there's a huge story here.

260
00:14:21,010 --> 00:14:26,010
Like the way that this world could be
completely transformed by these forces is

261
00:14:26,081 --> 00:14:29,380
not something that anybody is writing
about in part because it's a long story.

262
00:14:29,380 --> 00:14:32,270
But scientists and science
journalists were really, um,

263
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:35,830
they were really focused on making sure
that their messaging was hopeful and

264
00:14:35,831 --> 00:14:39,370
optimistic and they were reluctant
to talk about the scariest findings.

265
00:14:39,940 --> 00:14:44,110
And so I was terrified by the science.
I looked at it and I was like,

266
00:14:44,140 --> 00:14:48,340
nobody's talking about this, this
scary, got to like spread the word.

267
00:14:48,370 --> 00:14:52,810
And I wrote a big piece in 2017 that was
a very focused on worst case scenario.

268
00:14:52,811 --> 00:14:56,330
So I mentioned before, I think two
degrees is about our best case scenario.

269
00:14:56,390 --> 00:14:59,690
Four degrees is where we're on track for
now. This piece was looking at five, six,

270
00:14:59,691 --> 00:15:02,570
eight degrees of warming. So things were
not likely to get this century at least.

271
00:15:03,020 --> 00:15:07,040
And it was a huge phenomenon.
It was read by a bunch of million people.

272
00:15:07,070 --> 00:15:09,080
The biggest story of the New
York magazine had ever published.

273
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:10,610
And I just thought,
man,

274
00:15:10,650 --> 00:15:14,630
I guess there are a lot of people like
me out there who have intuitions about

275
00:15:15,050 --> 00:15:20,050
climate suffering and terror but aren't
seeing it in the way people are writing

276
00:15:20,721 --> 00:15:24,710
about the story. So I
decided, you know, there's,

277
00:15:24,770 --> 00:15:29,450
there's more to say and even beyond
like telling the bleak story,

278
00:15:29,451 --> 00:15:32,720
telling the really dark, I'm talking
about the really dark possibilities.

279
00:15:32,721 --> 00:15:37,040
I just thought there are all these
categories of life that we haven't even

280
00:15:37,041 --> 00:15:40,280
thought about how they'll impact us.
So we, we know about sea level rise,

281
00:15:40,281 --> 00:15:41,900
but that's like,
as I mentioned before,

282
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:45,530
that makes you think if you live
off the coast you'll be okay.

283
00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:48,080
But the whole planet is
going to be touched by this.

284
00:15:48,081 --> 00:15:49,760
Some places are going to
be hit harder than others.

285
00:15:50,170 --> 00:15:53,600
India is going to be hit by like 29%
of all global climate impacts of the

286
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:56,660
century. Um, but everyone's
going to be affected in some way.

287
00:15:56,661 --> 00:15:59,320
And the way that changes our politics,
the way it changes our pop culture,

288
00:15:59,330 --> 00:16:02,720
the way it changes our psychology,
our mood, our relationship to history,

289
00:16:02,721 --> 00:16:04,580
how we think about the future,
how we think about the past,

290
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,910
what we expect from capitalism,
what we blame capitalism for,

291
00:16:08,270 --> 00:16:11,540
what we expect from technology,
what we think technology can do.

292
00:16:11,540 --> 00:16:12,650
Can Technology Save us?

293
00:16:12,651 --> 00:16:15,770
Can technology entertain us
while the Burt world is burning.

294
00:16:16,220 --> 00:16:19,250
These are all these kind of like
humanities questions that I felt really,

295
00:16:19,430 --> 00:16:20,780
really had not been talked about.

296
00:16:20,810 --> 00:16:24,140
And so the book does like it's a tour
through what the world would look like

297
00:16:24,141 --> 00:16:28,010
between two and four degrees, but it's
also, which is a kind of hell scape,

298
00:16:28,610 --> 00:16:33,320
but it has also, you know, about half
of it is about we're going to live here,

299
00:16:33,410 --> 00:16:38,060
we're going to survive. In what form?
What will it mean, um, you know,

300
00:16:38,510 --> 00:16:41,620
myth at the mythological level.
What will it mean at the personal level?

301
00:16:41,640 --> 00:16:44,660
What will it mean the way we think about
our kids and their futures and all that

302
00:16:44,661 --> 00:16:48,080
stuff. And, um, you know, my, my,

303
00:16:48,230 --> 00:16:52,790
my big picture thinking
about it is, um, yeah,

304
00:16:52,791 --> 00:16:57,140
it's really bleak and I think there are
some possible ways that we could avert

305
00:16:57,290 --> 00:17:00,350
some of these worst case scenarios.
I mean,

306
00:17:00,950 --> 00:17:04,130
there is technology that can suck
carbon out of the atmosphere already.

307
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:08,870
It hasn't been tested at scale. It's
really expensive. But if we really,

308
00:17:09,230 --> 00:17:13,750
if we can over the next decade
or two really like build it, um,

309
00:17:14,120 --> 00:17:17,210
like global plantations of
these carbon capture machines,

310
00:17:18,140 --> 00:17:20,660
then not only can we like stop
the problem from moving forward,

311
00:17:20,661 --> 00:17:24,050
we could actually reverse it a little
bit. Um, yeah, I've seen those before.

312
00:17:24,051 --> 00:17:26,750
I've seen the designs for those
where they had these enormous,

313
00:17:26,810 --> 00:17:30,950
like a apartment building
sized air filter things. Yeah.

314
00:17:31,430 --> 00:17:35,150
I mean it's basically like only in theory
they're there and they do exist in the

315
00:17:35,151 --> 00:17:37,730
real world, but only the, either
kind of like an in laboratories.

316
00:17:37,731 --> 00:17:39,680
They don't exist at anything
like the scale they need to.

317
00:17:39,681 --> 00:17:44,681
But there's a guy at Harvard named
David Keith who has tested his machines.

318
00:17:45,710 --> 00:17:49,530
They're able to take carbon dioxide out
of the atmosphere at a cost of $100 a

319
00:17:49,531 --> 00:17:54,040
ton, which would mean we could
totally neutralized the entire, um,

320
00:17:54,210 --> 00:17:56,580
the entire carbon footprint
of the global economy.

321
00:17:56,580 --> 00:17:57,900
We wouldn't have to change anything.

322
00:17:58,170 --> 00:18:01,650
We could suck out all the extra carbon
or putting into the atmosphere for cost

323
00:18:01,651 --> 00:18:03,870
of $3 trillion a year,
which is a lot of money.

324
00:18:04,350 --> 00:18:07,680
But their estimates for how much we're
subsidizing the fossil fuel business that

325
00:18:07,681 --> 00:18:09,600
are as high as $5 trillion a year.

326
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:13,650
So we just redirected those subsidies
to this technology. In theory,

327
00:18:14,130 --> 00:18:17,910
we could literally solve the
problem immediately. There
are other complications.

328
00:18:17,911 --> 00:18:19,680
It's like in order to store the carbon,

329
00:18:19,681 --> 00:18:23,610
you need an industry that's two or three
times the size of our present oil and

330
00:18:23,611 --> 00:18:24,444
gas industry,
which,

331
00:18:24,900 --> 00:18:28,410
and where that goes next to who's homes
and all that stuff is complicated.

332
00:18:28,770 --> 00:18:32,250
But we have the tools we need. It's
just a matter of deciding to, um,

333
00:18:32,940 --> 00:18:37,500
put them into practice.
And I think we're pretty like that.

334
00:18:37,650 --> 00:18:41,820
You know, recent history shows that,
um, we're not doing that fast enough.

335
00:18:41,820 --> 00:18:46,740
So one of the big, you know, points
that I'm making the book in I,

336
00:18:46,890 --> 00:18:49,500
it's six in my heads as
strongly as you know,

337
00:18:49,501 --> 00:18:53,040
we think of climate change is this
thing that started in the industrial

338
00:18:53,041 --> 00:18:54,480
evolution like centuries ago,

339
00:18:55,410 --> 00:18:58,590
but half of all the carbon that we've put
into the atmosphere and the history of

340
00:18:58,591 --> 00:19:01,740
humanity from the burning of
fossil fuels has come in 30 years.

341
00:19:01,830 --> 00:19:02,730
The last 30 years.

342
00:19:02,731 --> 00:19:06,330
That's since Al Gore published his
first book on warming it since the UN

343
00:19:06,331 --> 00:19:10,110
established their climate change panel.
It's since the premiere of Seinfeld.

344
00:19:10,590 --> 00:19:15,480
So like you and I have lived through the
lion's share of all of the damage done

345
00:19:15,481 --> 00:19:18,930
to the climate in all of
human history. Whoa. Yeah.

346
00:19:19,830 --> 00:19:22,200
And the next 30 years are going
to be just as consequential.

347
00:19:22,260 --> 00:19:26,610
So we brought the world from the
basically a stable climate to the brink of

348
00:19:26,611 --> 00:19:31,290
total climate catastrophe in 30 years.
One generation,

349
00:19:31,830 --> 00:19:36,120
we have about one generation to save it.
To me that's like,

350
00:19:36,450 --> 00:19:38,130
it makes me uncomfortable
to use this language,

351
00:19:38,131 --> 00:19:40,080
but it's basically a theological story.

352
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:44,670
We have the entire fate of the planet
in the hands of these two generations.

353
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:47,220
What happens 50 years from now,

354
00:19:47,221 --> 00:19:52,221
a hundred years from now will entirely
be up to the way we act now and what we

355
00:19:52,651 --> 00:19:57,060
do. And the timescale is so crazy
because you have this really compressed,

356
00:19:57,540 --> 00:20:00,570
we must act now to avert these
worst case scenarios, timescale.

357
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:05,760
But also the impacts will unfold if
we don't do anything over millennia.

358
00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:08,160
So like we could have,
you know,

359
00:20:08,161 --> 00:20:12,210
if we really bring into being
the total melt of all ice sheets,

360
00:20:12,990 --> 00:20:16,680
that means that eight centuries from now,
12 centuries from now,

361
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:20,670
people will be dealing with the
shit that we're fucking up today.

362
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:26,120
We will be engineering problems for them
to be solving 80012001500 years from

363
00:20:26,881 --> 00:20:31,881
now and that damage will be done if
it is done in the next 30 or 50 years.

364
00:20:33,210 --> 00:20:34,380
So we are,

365
00:20:34,710 --> 00:20:39,710
I mean we are really writing this epic
story about Earth humanity and our future

366
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:45,900
on this planet in the time of a
single lifetime, a single generation.

367
00:20:46,290 --> 00:20:47,390
And that is on the,

368
00:20:47,540 --> 00:20:51,790
on the one hand it's sort of like
overwhelming but it's also empowering,

369
00:20:52,700 --> 00:20:54,070
you know like um,

370
00:20:54,340 --> 00:20:57,490
all the climate impacts that I talk
about all the climate horrors that are

371
00:20:57,491 --> 00:21:02,350
really terrifying. If we make them
happen, we will be making them happen.

372
00:21:03,350 --> 00:21:06,640
Domain input in the system is how much
carbon we put into the atmosphere.

373
00:21:06,700 --> 00:21:08,540
There are feedback loops that
people are worried about.

374
00:21:08,550 --> 00:21:11,890
There are things about climate that we
can't control, but at least at this point,

375
00:21:12,250 --> 00:21:17,110
the main driver of future warming
is what we do. And so we could,

376
00:21:17,260 --> 00:21:21,070
if we get to a four degree hellscape
with hundreds of millions or a billion

377
00:21:21,071 --> 00:21:24,190
climate refugees,
that will be because of what we're doing.

378
00:21:24,550 --> 00:21:29,020
It's not some system outside of our
control, even though we're often kind of,

379
00:21:29,021 --> 00:21:31,930
we find it kind of comforting to think
that it's outside of our control because

380
00:21:31,931 --> 00:21:34,230
that means we don't have to change it.
Well

381
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:38,700
one of the problems with climate change
is that human beings like to react to

382
00:21:38,701 --> 00:21:40,470
things that are immediate
and right in front of them.

383
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:44,100
And I think for us it's very
difficult to see the future,

384
00:21:44,310 --> 00:21:45,980
especially if it's inconvenient as,

385
00:21:45,981 --> 00:21:50,981
especially if it does
something to inconvenience or
get in the way of our day to

386
00:21:51,810 --> 00:21:55,230
day routine. And that seems to be
what happened, what's happening here.

387
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:57,450
And that seems to me,
excuse me,

388
00:21:57,510 --> 00:22:02,130
that seems to me to be why people
are so willing to dismiss it.

389
00:22:02,450 --> 00:22:06,180
Uh, so flippantly because in front
of them right now it's not an issue.

390
00:22:06,420 --> 00:22:09,120
And in front of them right now.
This very second is very day.

391
00:22:09,121 --> 00:22:12,360
I'm going to go to Starbucks. It's right
there. It's open. Look, I'm outside.

392
00:22:12,510 --> 00:22:15,500
It's 65 degrees out. Global
warming's not a problem. Yeah, yeah.

393
00:22:15,950 --> 00:22:19,420
No, I think that's, I mean, totally true
and I feel it in my own life. Like I,

394
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:22,190
I mean I've been living, I've been
working in this material so long,

395
00:22:22,460 --> 00:22:26,330
I know it so deeply and yet when I
look out the window I'm like, you know,

396
00:22:26,331 --> 00:22:30,380
things are fine. Yeah. And I think that
has a really powerful anchoring effect.

397
00:22:30,381 --> 00:22:33,650
Like we expect the world of the future
to look like the world as it does today,

398
00:22:33,890 --> 00:22:34,930
but all the sciences,

399
00:22:35,060 --> 00:22:39,530
that's totally naive and we're going to
have at least twice as much warming as

400
00:22:39,531 --> 00:22:40,580
we've had to this point.

401
00:22:41,060 --> 00:22:43,760
And I think we need to think about the
future of the world in those terms.

402
00:22:43,761 --> 00:22:46,040
Like what? It will be a two degrees
or three degrees at four degrees,

403
00:22:46,580 --> 00:22:48,230
but it's not just like the immediacy.

404
00:22:48,231 --> 00:22:53,030
I think we have so many biases that may
like we want to be optimistic about the

405
00:22:53,031 --> 00:22:56,480
future. We have a status quo bias.
We don't want to change things.

406
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:58,970
We think that will be
complicated and expensive.

407
00:22:59,180 --> 00:23:02,210
We have a hard time holding big
ideas in our head like that.

408
00:23:02,211 --> 00:23:05,920
The entire planet is like
subject to these forces. Um,

409
00:23:05,930 --> 00:23:09,260
I mean the list goes on and on and in the
book I have a little riff where I say,

410
00:23:09,261 --> 00:23:13,630
you know, there's this new not
so new now 30, 40 year, um,

411
00:23:14,390 --> 00:23:16,820
discipline in economics,
behavioral economics,

412
00:23:16,821 --> 00:23:19,580
which is about all of our cognitive
biases. How we can't really see the world.

413
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:23,300
Every single one makes it harder
to see climate. There's this, um,

414
00:23:23,330 --> 00:23:25,550
he's actually an English professor
named Timothy Morton who wrote,

415
00:23:25,551 --> 00:23:30,170
who wrote a book about, um, climate
and he calls it a hyper object,

416
00:23:30,171 --> 00:23:31,004
which is like,
it's a,

417
00:23:31,220 --> 00:23:36,170
it's a phenomenon that's so big that we
can't actually hold it in our heads at

418
00:23:36,171 --> 00:23:37,760
once.
We can only see it.

419
00:23:37,790 --> 00:23:41,060
It's like if you imagine seeing a four
dimensional object in three dimensional

420
00:23:41,061 --> 00:23:44,930
space, it's that kind of thing where
you can only see it at an angle only.

421
00:23:46,070 --> 00:23:51,070
Climate change is so all encompassing
that we can't comprehend it properly.

422
00:23:53,160 --> 00:23:55,040
Um,
but I think that's all,

423
00:23:55,041 --> 00:23:59,330
all of those things are reasons that we
need to be listening to the scientists

424
00:23:59,420 --> 00:24:00,980
and what they're projecting.

425
00:24:01,010 --> 00:24:04,430
Not to say that everything they're saying
is going to come true will come true.

426
00:24:04,431 --> 00:24:08,030
Exactly as they predict it.
Obviously that's not how science works.

427
00:24:08,031 --> 00:24:10,700
It gets revised. Some things are
alarmist, some things are extreme,

428
00:24:11,420 --> 00:24:14,390
something's just wrong.
But you know,

429
00:24:14,391 --> 00:24:17,150
I've been really working on this stuff
for a couple of years and the number of

430
00:24:17,151 --> 00:24:22,151
papers I've read that show that make me
have a more optimistic idea about the

431
00:24:22,161 --> 00:24:23,120
cut future of climate.

432
00:24:23,510 --> 00:24:26,960
I could count on two hands and the number
of papers I've read that make me have

433
00:24:26,961 --> 00:24:29,840
a bleaker view of the future.
It's in the thousands.

434
00:24:30,350 --> 00:24:32,300
And when you look at the totality of that,

435
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:36,530
whether the six climate driven natural
disasters prediction is going to pan out

436
00:24:36,531 --> 00:24:40,290
exactly as those authors say, who
knows? But when you see, you know,

437
00:24:40,910 --> 00:24:43,910
so many, so many terrifying
studies that you could fill.

438
00:24:43,970 --> 00:24:46,040
Like I did a 300 page book with them.

439
00:24:46,700 --> 00:24:49,910
You realize that like there's a huge
margin for error and it would like,

440
00:24:49,940 --> 00:24:54,170
we would still be really in bad
shape, you know? Is there a,

441
00:24:54,890 --> 00:24:55,221
I mean,

442
00:24:55,221 --> 00:25:00,221
I'm sure there have been some studies
that made mistakes in terms of like past

443
00:25:00,381 --> 00:25:03,860
studies had projected that
by now we'd all be dead. Um,

444
00:25:04,490 --> 00:25:09,490
are those a PR they'll seem to be a
problem with this whole concept we have of

445
00:25:10,191 --> 00:25:13,430
wrapping our head around it and if we
find anything that we could point to that

446
00:25:13,431 --> 00:25:17,300
say the way back in the 80s, they said
we all be dead by now and we're fine,

447
00:25:17,330 --> 00:25:21,050
we're going to be fine. That kind of
thing. Is that, that is an issue. Correct.

448
00:25:21,051 --> 00:25:22,310
Totally. Yeah. There was, um,

449
00:25:22,370 --> 00:25:24,530
there was a really famous book in the
Middle Of the 20th century called the

450
00:25:24,531 --> 00:25:27,930
population bomb. So this is a guy
named Paul Erlick or luck, um,

451
00:25:28,190 --> 00:25:30,440
who he was like,
you know,

452
00:25:30,500 --> 00:25:33,800
the world just cannot
support this many people.

453
00:25:33,801 --> 00:25:37,130
Like if we get to 8 billion people,
there just won't be enough food.

454
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:39,620
There won't be, you know, the,
the planet can't sustain that.

455
00:25:40,250 --> 00:25:43,300
And he's often pointed to is this
sort of like profit of dooms day.

456
00:25:43,420 --> 00:25:47,030
That and his prophecy totally didn't
work out because we had this thing that's

457
00:25:47,031 --> 00:25:50,960
called the green revolution. Basically.
We figured out a way as to make crops way,

458
00:25:50,961 --> 00:25:55,100
way, way more productive.
And that's encouraging.

459
00:25:55,220 --> 00:25:57,200
Human civilization does that a lot.

460
00:25:57,201 --> 00:26:00,020
We figure our way out of
Fox holes all the time. Um,

461
00:26:00,620 --> 00:26:05,620
but that revolution was literally like
one dude Norman Borlaug who figured out

462
00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:09,800
how to grow crops differently and one guy,

463
00:26:09,890 --> 00:26:13,040
one set of innovations and he completely
transformed the whole fate of the

464
00:26:13,041 --> 00:26:15,970
planet. What did he do?
He just basically did, um,

465
00:26:16,670 --> 00:26:20,900
like genetically modified crops before,
like the, you know, before the name,

466
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:25,670
it was like, um, he could golden
rice guy. Yeah. Oh, okay. Yeah.

467
00:26:25,730 --> 00:26:27,230
And um,
and you know,

468
00:26:27,260 --> 00:26:31,400
the whole developing world benefited
enormously and you're still seeing that

469
00:26:31,401 --> 00:26:34,850
today. Like we see all these charts
that, you know, so much less poverty,

470
00:26:34,851 --> 00:26:37,670
so much less infant mortality in
developing world. And that's great.

471
00:26:37,671 --> 00:26:39,110
That's like incredible progress.

472
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:44,010
But a lot of that has was powered
by the of those countries,

473
00:26:44,011 --> 00:26:48,030
so that bill is going to
come do going forward. Um,

474
00:26:48,570 --> 00:26:52,230
and you know, I think like when
you look at climate change,

475
00:26:53,580 --> 00:26:55,290
you know,
if there was just one threat,

476
00:26:55,500 --> 00:26:59,070
like let's take agriculture since we're
talking about agriculture estimates,

477
00:26:59,071 --> 00:27:02,100
say that, um, if we continue on the path
we're on, by the end of the century,

478
00:27:02,910 --> 00:27:07,910
grain yields would be half as
productive as they are today just by the

479
00:27:08,311 --> 00:27:11,160
temperature effect.
So we'd have just as much land,

480
00:27:11,190 --> 00:27:15,300
just as much grain crops as we have now,
but the food we get from it,

481
00:27:15,301 --> 00:27:17,040
we'd only get half as
much as we got today.

482
00:27:17,380 --> 00:27:20,900
What's the cause of that is just
the temperature effects plants,

483
00:27:20,901 --> 00:27:24,720
the temperature alone. Wow. I mean
there are other impacts to on food. Um,

484
00:27:25,230 --> 00:27:28,470
like insects, there's hotter
temperatures means more insects,

485
00:27:28,471 --> 00:27:32,730
which is bad for crops. Um, carbon has a
complicated relationship to crop growth.

486
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:35,730
Like in some plants grow better,
better with more carbon,

487
00:27:36,150 --> 00:27:39,390
but actually they're like the weeds and
the ones that we like to eat don't grow

488
00:27:39,391 --> 00:27:42,990
better with more carbon. Um, and
you know, by the end of the century,

489
00:27:42,991 --> 00:27:46,290
so we could have half as much grain and
we could have 50% more people than we

490
00:27:46,291 --> 00:27:49,230
have right now. Um, now there's
a way you could imagine, oh,

491
00:27:49,231 --> 00:27:51,240
well maybe there'll be
another Norman Borlaug,

492
00:27:51,241 --> 00:27:55,140
maybe he'll figure out a way through that.
But when you look across the spectrum,

493
00:27:55,170 --> 00:28:00,090
it's like agriculture. It's, you know,
conflict for every half degree of warming,

494
00:28:00,380 --> 00:28:02,700
we need to get between
10 and 20% more war.

495
00:28:03,030 --> 00:28:04,140
So if we get to the end of the century,

496
00:28:04,141 --> 00:28:06,250
we're going to have more than
twice as much wars. We have to,

497
00:28:06,260 --> 00:28:10,500
and this is projected because of battles
over resources, mainly that famines,

498
00:28:10,501 --> 00:28:13,110
droughts, um, weather,
you know, weather impacts.

499
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:17,910
Basically everything about
unstable societies get
stressed by temperature rise.

500
00:28:18,090 --> 00:28:19,600
The Syrian civil war was,
you know,

501
00:28:19,601 --> 00:28:22,380
it wasn't single leak caused
by climate change, but it was,

502
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:25,980
that's one of the causes.
There was a drought and that produced it.

503
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:28,770
And that conflict,

504
00:28:28,771 --> 00:28:32,550
it's not just at the level of
nation states or even civil war,

505
00:28:32,551 --> 00:28:35,070
it's also at the level of individuals.
So if you look at crime statistics,

506
00:28:35,071 --> 00:28:37,200
when temperatures go up, there's
more murder, there's more rape.

507
00:28:37,710 --> 00:28:41,220
People get admitted to mental hospitals
more when there's, when it's warmer out.

508
00:28:41,510 --> 00:28:45,360
Um, babies develop less well in
the womb when it's hotter out.

509
00:28:45,390 --> 00:28:48,390
If there's for every day over 90
degrees that have babies in the womb,

510
00:28:48,630 --> 00:28:52,680
you can see those days in that baby's
lifetime earnings and we're living,

511
00:28:52,681 --> 00:28:55,710
we're going to be living on a
planet that's considerably warmer,

512
00:28:56,550 --> 00:29:00,360
that's going to have real dramatic
effects on everything. Um, air pollution,

513
00:29:00,810 --> 00:29:04,470
there's a big study that I write about
in the book that's totally alarming and

514
00:29:04,471 --> 00:29:05,304
eye opening,

515
00:29:05,970 --> 00:29:09,720
just between 1.5 degrees and two degrees
of warming just through the effects of

516
00:29:09,721 --> 00:29:14,490
air pollution would cause at one
half degree of warming would cause an

517
00:29:14,491 --> 00:29:17,520
additional hundred and 53 million deaths,

518
00:29:17,940 --> 00:29:22,890
which is 25 holocausts.
That's just air pollution,

519
00:29:22,920 --> 00:29:24,690
just between 1.5 and two degrees.

520
00:29:24,691 --> 00:29:27,210
And two degrees for me is
our best case scenario.

521
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:31,860
So our best case scenario is 25 holocausts
worth of death from air pollution.

522
00:29:33,270 --> 00:29:35,790
And that sounds terrifying. People
when I say that to them, they're like,

523
00:29:35,791 --> 00:29:39,600
Holy Shit, how could we
possibly that's unconscionable.

524
00:29:40,410 --> 00:29:45,410
But already 9 million people are dying
every year from air pollution and we

525
00:29:46,691 --> 00:29:50,020
don't pay attention to it.
So I think the likeliest outcome,

526
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:52,540
even as we enter into
this like climate scape,

527
00:29:53,080 --> 00:29:56,860
is that we find ways to turn away and
not look at like the real pain of people,

528
00:29:56,861 --> 00:30:00,400
especially in the developing world. But
to answer your earlier question, you know,

529
00:30:00,401 --> 00:30:02,770
like you can imagine
agriculture getting figured out,

530
00:30:02,920 --> 00:30:07,870
but when you see just how many impacts
there are, it's like it's everywhere.

531
00:30:08,170 --> 00:30:09,430
Everything will be changed.

532
00:30:09,431 --> 00:30:13,210
And it just makes the challenge that
much bigger and more complicated because

533
00:30:13,620 --> 00:30:16,150
how he, you know, how are we going
to solve the conflict problem?

534
00:30:16,420 --> 00:30:19,780
How are you going to solve the problem
of having 30% less economic growth?

535
00:30:20,440 --> 00:30:21,011
You know,
like I said,

536
00:30:21,011 --> 00:30:23,650
that's an impact that's twice as big
as the great depression and it would be

537
00:30:23,651 --> 00:30:27,520
permanent, um, $600 trillion in,

538
00:30:27,630 --> 00:30:31,490
in climate damage as twice as much
wealth as exists in the world today. Um,

539
00:30:31,660 --> 00:30:35,820
and that's just, you know,
then you deal with the right
refugees, food. I mean it's,

540
00:30:35,821 --> 00:30:39,090
it's, it's so all
encompassing. And I think, um,

541
00:30:39,190 --> 00:30:43,280
that's another reason why we don't
want to look at it closely because it's

542
00:30:43,370 --> 00:30:44,610
terrifying. Well, there,

543
00:30:44,611 --> 00:30:48,660
there's also a matter of how it's being
projected to the public, right? Like in,

544
00:30:48,661 --> 00:30:53,420
in certain circles, particularly
right wing circles. Uh,

545
00:30:53,480 --> 00:30:53,931
there,

546
00:30:53,931 --> 00:30:58,931
there are people that are trying to
paint this with rose colored glasses,

547
00:30:59,390 --> 00:30:59,691
right?

548
00:30:59,691 --> 00:31:04,691
They're trying to maximize short term
profits and sort of dismiss the risks of

549
00:31:05,691 --> 00:31:08,570
climate change and dismissed the risks of,

550
00:31:08,870 --> 00:31:12,380
or rather the impact of, uh, our, uh,

551
00:31:12,440 --> 00:31:15,200
what we've done in terms of raising
the carbon in the atmosphere.

552
00:31:15,410 --> 00:31:18,560
There's some people that point to that
like this, this is nonsense science.

553
00:31:18,561 --> 00:31:22,550
This has been disproven.
There's a few people like
that, but it's an overwhelming,

554
00:31:22,551 --> 00:31:27,440
the overwhelming consensus of scientists
who studied this are terrified. Yeah.

555
00:31:27,441 --> 00:31:31,850
I would say there was some recent report
that said it now past the standard of

556
00:31:31,851 --> 00:31:36,470
physics that like climate science
is now more reliable than physics.

557
00:31:36,770 --> 00:31:38,060
Um,
but hilarious.

558
00:31:39,250 --> 00:31:42,340
But you know, the, um, to the deniers,

559
00:31:42,341 --> 00:31:47,260
you say things like, you know, the
planet was hotter than this before.

560
00:31:47,710 --> 00:31:50,350
That's true. Yeah. Dinosaurs lived
here. Humans, we're not here.

561
00:31:51,160 --> 00:31:54,190
I mean if we're four degrees warmer for
the last time the plan was four degrees

562
00:31:54,191 --> 00:31:58,620
warmer, there were palm trees
in the Arctic. Um, what's, yeah,

563
00:31:59,050 --> 00:31:59,470
really,

564
00:31:59,470 --> 00:32:04,470
we've already exited the entire window
of temperature that enclose all of human

565
00:32:05,081 --> 00:32:05,710
history.

566
00:32:05,710 --> 00:32:09,580
So the planet is now warmer than it
ever has been when humans were around to

567
00:32:09,581 --> 00:32:10,414
walk on it.

568
00:32:10,420 --> 00:32:13,000
Which means to me it's an open question
whether humans would have ever evolved

569
00:32:13,001 --> 00:32:16,420
in the first place. And this is all from
the industrial revolution from then on.

570
00:32:16,900 --> 00:32:21,280
Yeah. And uh, yeah, and
like an to that question,

571
00:32:21,281 --> 00:32:23,920
it's like there are people who say
there are some natural warming going on.

572
00:32:24,160 --> 00:32:27,160
I don't think that's true. I think
most scientists would say it isn't.

573
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:30,550
But I also think if what we're
seeing is natural warming,

574
00:32:30,551 --> 00:32:33,790
that should terrify us even more because
it would mean that it's outside of our

575
00:32:33,791 --> 00:32:34,624
control.

576
00:32:34,630 --> 00:32:37,390
And if we're really heading down the path
that we're heading down and we have no

577
00:32:37,391 --> 00:32:39,590
control over it,
that's even more scary.

578
00:32:40,040 --> 00:32:43,490
It should be a comfort that we're doing
it because it means we can stop doing it.

579
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:44,810
Well,

580
00:32:44,810 --> 00:32:47,360
it should be a comfort that there's
people smarter than the people that don't

581
00:32:47,361 --> 00:32:48,200
think that we're doing it.

582
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:53,450
That there are people that can possibly
consider some sort of way to mitigate

583
00:32:53,451 --> 00:32:55,280
this. And what, what are the,

584
00:32:55,460 --> 00:32:59,000
what are the ways that are being proposed
and how seriously are they being taken

585
00:32:59,001 --> 00:33:00,210
other than this,
um,

586
00:33:00,530 --> 00:33:03,530
the idea of building these machines
to extract carbon from the atmosphere.

587
00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:05,450
I'm sure you're probably aware of,
um,

588
00:33:06,290 --> 00:33:08,480
there's some of the programs
that they've talked about. Uh,

589
00:33:08,510 --> 00:33:12,080
we're suspending reflective
particles in the atmosphere to,

590
00:33:12,590 --> 00:33:16,340
to minimize the amount of solar radiation
we receive. Yeah. So it's interesting,

591
00:33:16,341 --> 00:33:19,130
this guy who I mentioned earlier
who's like done the most,

592
00:33:19,320 --> 00:33:21,710
the most innovative
carbon capture machine.

593
00:33:21,980 --> 00:33:25,370
I talked to him a few weeks ago
and he was like, no, no, no,

594
00:33:25,371 --> 00:33:26,810
but we shouldn't be using carbon capture.

595
00:33:26,820 --> 00:33:30,110
We should be doing solar geoengineering,
which is what you're talking about. Um,

596
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:34,490
and that means probably suspending sulfur
is like the most useful thing and the

597
00:33:34,491 --> 00:33:37,460
atmosphere, I'm great. We're going
to smell like software. This,

598
00:33:37,650 --> 00:33:41,120
the sky would get red. Oh Jesus. They're
all of these aesthetic effects too,

599
00:33:41,121 --> 00:33:44,180
which nobody talks about. So like trees
are going to just turn immediately brown.

600
00:33:44,330 --> 00:33:45,790
I'm not going to turn color it.

601
00:33:45,860 --> 00:33:47,900
There was a study a couple of weeks
ago that the oceans are going to change

602
00:33:47,901 --> 00:33:50,760
color. Um, there, this is,
if we do that, if we suspend,

603
00:33:51,020 --> 00:33:52,760
this is just pure warming
just from warming.

604
00:33:52,790 --> 00:33:56,240
The ocean is going to change color to
what I think just from more green to more

605
00:33:56,241 --> 00:34:00,510
blue, but it'd be nice.
Yeah. Um, but yeah, so the,

606
00:34:00,550 --> 00:34:03,650
the software thing is,
so we could, you know,

607
00:34:03,651 --> 00:34:08,651
we could suspend these
basically an umbrella of sulfur
around in the atmosphere,

608
00:34:08,900 --> 00:34:10,130
which would mean that it would,

609
00:34:10,131 --> 00:34:12,890
some of the sunlight coming to the
earth would be reflected back into the

610
00:34:12,891 --> 00:34:16,460
atmosphere. And that would mean that
the sun would absorb less sunlight.

611
00:34:16,700 --> 00:34:18,800
I mean the earth would
absorb less sunlight,

612
00:34:18,801 --> 00:34:21,150
which would make it a little bit cooler.
Um,

613
00:34:21,200 --> 00:34:26,200
the problem is that would have some
crippling impact on agriculture and we

614
00:34:26,721 --> 00:34:29,390
basically don't know other
side effects that would have.

615
00:34:29,540 --> 00:34:33,620
And how would you take that stuff out
when you could just stop doing it?

616
00:34:33,621 --> 00:34:35,900
It has a shelf life of, I don't
know what it is, 10 years.

617
00:34:35,900 --> 00:34:38,090
So you could just stop doing it.
And that's a big concern actually,

618
00:34:38,091 --> 00:34:42,590
because if we did that just to mask the
amount of global warming that we were

619
00:34:42,591 --> 00:34:46,550
doing,
then whatever program was responsible for,

620
00:34:46,551 --> 00:34:50,120
it would be really vulnerable
to terrorism, to war.

621
00:34:50,570 --> 00:34:52,610
Because if we,
if we were,

622
00:34:52,670 --> 00:34:56,690
if the planet were functionally warmed,
say five degrees,

623
00:34:56,691 --> 00:34:59,990
but we were suspending enough software
that it was actually only two degrees

624
00:34:59,991 --> 00:35:02,480
warmer than if we just,
for instance,

625
00:35:02,481 --> 00:35:04,940
like somebody bombed the
facility that was doing it,

626
00:35:05,210 --> 00:35:07,490
the planet would be immediately
tripped into a much,

627
00:35:07,491 --> 00:35:11,420
much hotter state and that would
be completely catastrophic.

628
00:35:11,421 --> 00:35:15,110
Even more catastrophic than a more slow
approach to five degrees because we

629
00:35:15,111 --> 00:35:17,960
would adjust to it. We, over a
century or several centuries,

630
00:35:17,961 --> 00:35:21,590
we met in ways we'd be able to adjust to
it. But if it was immediate, immediate,

631
00:35:22,550 --> 00:35:23,570
why sulfur?

632
00:35:24,110 --> 00:35:26,960
I think it's just something about
the particular characteristic of it.

633
00:35:26,961 --> 00:35:30,050
I don't know, wouldn't it smell harm?
It would literally be like hell.

634
00:35:30,051 --> 00:35:33,270
Like that's what you yeah. You always
hear about with the horror movies, right?

635
00:35:33,350 --> 00:35:37,050
The devil smells like sulfur.
Yeah. And I mean it's the, um,

636
00:35:37,320 --> 00:35:39,870
it's what farts smell like. Yeah.
And the reason that we were,

637
00:35:39,871 --> 00:35:43,990
the reason we're able to smell farts
is because sulfur is also, I mean,

638
00:35:44,010 --> 00:35:47,880
some related compounds,
hydrogen sulfide are, um,

639
00:35:48,360 --> 00:35:52,920
are really toxic. And so that brings me
to methane. That's another issue as well,

640
00:35:52,921 --> 00:35:57,780
right? Yeah. The cows producing methane
gas, large scale agricultural. Yeah.

641
00:35:57,781 --> 00:36:01,140
Wait, let me just say one more thing about
short boom. The solar geoengineering.

642
00:36:01,141 --> 00:36:04,500
So the thing about it that this is real,
this sounds horrifying. This program,

643
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:06,240
people are excited about it
because it's really cheap.

644
00:36:06,241 --> 00:36:10,470
It's way cheaper than carbon capture.
And um, but so there's a positive for it.

645
00:36:10,710 --> 00:36:12,280
But it's also,
um,

646
00:36:13,910 --> 00:36:15,900
we are basically already doing this.

647
00:36:16,170 --> 00:36:19,140
So we have what's called small
particulate pollution. Um,

648
00:36:19,230 --> 00:36:23,160
that's where aerosol pollution, um,
stuffed, suspended the, in the atmosphere.

649
00:36:23,161 --> 00:36:26,010
That's why like Delhi is really hard
to breathe in cause we have a lot of

650
00:36:26,190 --> 00:36:31,080
particulate in the atmosphere that is
already suppressing global temperatures by

651
00:36:31,081 --> 00:36:34,530
as much as a half degree or
maybe one degree, which means,

652
00:36:34,650 --> 00:36:37,170
and that's the reason that those 9 million
people are dying every year from air

653
00:36:37,171 --> 00:36:40,480
pollution. So if we solve that problem,
if we solve the air pollution problem,

654
00:36:40,481 --> 00:36:43,290
save those 9 million lives every year,

655
00:36:43,470 --> 00:36:46,290
we would immediately make the planet
at least a half a degree warmer and

656
00:36:46,291 --> 00:36:47,400
possibly one degree warmer,

657
00:36:47,401 --> 00:36:51,720
which would put us at the threshold
of catastrophe or above it. Um,

658
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:54,810
so we're sort of already doing this
program, just not in a systematic way.

659
00:36:54,811 --> 00:36:58,170
We're doing it in a haphazard way.
Um, the methane you mentioned,

660
00:36:58,171 --> 00:37:02,970
there are basically two big issues
with methane. The first is, um, cows.

661
00:37:03,480 --> 00:37:07,950
Um, so yeah, cows produce
a ton of methane, which is
depending on how you count,

662
00:37:07,951 --> 00:37:12,780
about 35 or maybe 85 times stronger,
a greenhouse gas than carbon.

663
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:15,770
Whoa. Yeah, it's really intense. Um,

664
00:37:16,050 --> 00:37:19,920
but there are also these like small
scale studies that show if we feed cattle

665
00:37:19,921 --> 00:37:24,420
just a little bit of seaweed there,
methane emissions could fall by 95 or 99%.

666
00:37:24,690 --> 00:37:28,680
So we could if, if that was scalable,
which is not clear it is, but if it was,

667
00:37:28,830 --> 00:37:31,920
we could immediately eliminate the
entire carbon footprint of beef,

668
00:37:32,070 --> 00:37:35,040
which people talk about a lot now.
That's incredible. Yeah, it just,

669
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:37,560
it's a reminder to me that
like, you know, you get told,

670
00:37:37,561 --> 00:37:39,240
oh you should eat less for
hamburgers or whatever.

671
00:37:39,390 --> 00:37:42,150
But obviously this is like a problem
that's too big to be solved with like

672
00:37:42,151 --> 00:37:42,990
individual choices.

673
00:37:42,990 --> 00:37:46,080
We need some kind of global policy
or national policy about it.

674
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:48,900
But the scarier methane issue is,
um,

675
00:37:49,650 --> 00:37:53,820
there's all this carbon stored in frozen
permafrost and the northern latitudes,

676
00:37:54,270 --> 00:37:58,200
um, that permafrost is
melting and when it melts,

677
00:37:58,201 --> 00:38:00,000
that carbon will be released
into the atmosphere.

678
00:38:00,270 --> 00:38:04,740
We don't know the proportion that it
will be released as carbon dioxide versus

679
00:38:04,741 --> 00:38:06,530
methane,
but um,

680
00:38:06,630 --> 00:38:11,160
there is in that permafrost twice as much
carbon as now exists in the atmosphere,

681
00:38:11,550 --> 00:38:15,360
which means if it were all released
possibly in a relatively sudden way,

682
00:38:15,600 --> 00:38:19,810
it could make, um, our carbon problem
immediately, three times worse. Um,

683
00:38:19,890 --> 00:38:23,400
and it could be even the effect could
even be more dramatic than that if it was

684
00:38:23,401 --> 00:38:26,430
released mostly as methane because
methane is stronger greenhouse gas.

685
00:38:27,080 --> 00:38:29,510
Most scientists think that that's not
something that we need to freak out about

686
00:38:29,511 --> 00:38:31,920
it in the short term,
but it's there,

687
00:38:32,130 --> 00:38:34,950
it is melting and methane is
being released at some rate.

688
00:38:34,990 --> 00:38:39,990
So craziest solution that I ever heard
for that one was to bring back the woolly

689
00:38:40,631 --> 00:38:43,660
mammoth. Yeah, yeah. They're
trying to do that. Yeah.

690
00:38:44,140 --> 00:38:47,650
And the idea that the woolly mammoth
is going gonna save us all by releasing

691
00:38:47,651 --> 00:38:51,520
them throughout Siberia. Yeah.
It's crazy, right? I mean,

692
00:38:51,521 --> 00:38:55,570
I think that we're going to have a whole
a century of shit like that and shit

693
00:38:55,571 --> 00:38:58,870
like cows eating seaweed that everything,
you know,

694
00:38:58,900 --> 00:39:03,900
we'll have our global politics will be
reoriented around climate change so that

695
00:39:04,390 --> 00:39:08,270
you'll start to see sanctions put against
nations that are behaving badly. Um,

696
00:39:08,410 --> 00:39:09,850
NBS, the guy who's, you know,

697
00:39:09,851 --> 00:39:14,230
the like kind of thug who's running
Saudi Arabia now says he needs Saudi

698
00:39:14,230 --> 00:39:18,490
Arabia's economy to be totally off oil
by 2050 and I think that's cause he knows

699
00:39:18,491 --> 00:39:19,151
that,
you know,

700
00:39:19,151 --> 00:39:24,151
the global community will not tolerate
someone producing more oil and as

701
00:39:24,401 --> 00:39:28,240
recently as you know, as, as soon as a
few decades from now. But the impacts are,

702
00:39:28,340 --> 00:39:33,250
you know, everywhere. So that like, um,
yeah, like in California now you can,

703
00:39:33,310 --> 00:39:37,480
you know, during wildfire season
you can buy, um, masks to, you know,

704
00:39:37,750 --> 00:39:40,480
to shield yourself from the smoke,
which is really, really damaging.

705
00:39:40,481 --> 00:39:43,540
Its Effects on cognitive
performance are really dramatic.

706
00:39:43,740 --> 00:39:46,390
It can lower cognitive
performance by like 10 to 15%.

707
00:39:46,630 --> 00:39:50,590
It's effect on the development
of kids is really dramatic. Um,

708
00:39:50,620 --> 00:39:54,970
there was an incredible study a few
years ago where if you looked at places

709
00:39:54,971 --> 00:39:58,170
where they instituted easy, do you have
easy pass out here in California? No,

710
00:39:58,171 --> 00:40:03,120
we don't. We don't have tolls.
Oh, right. It's an amazing thing.

711
00:40:03,540 --> 00:40:06,610
What one or two places
depending on where you lived.

712
00:40:06,611 --> 00:40:10,540
And you'd have to take that
every day. Dude, in New York,
they're everywhere. Okay.

713
00:40:10,930 --> 00:40:14,500
So it used to be the case that the cars
had to like slow down and pay a toll and

714
00:40:14,501 --> 00:40:15,400
because they were slowing down,

715
00:40:15,401 --> 00:40:19,270
they produce more exhaust when they
instituted easy pass cars could just drive

716
00:40:19,271 --> 00:40:23,470
through and that meant they produce
less exhaust and the effect on the,

717
00:40:23,500 --> 00:40:26,950
on premature birth and low birth weight
in the areas where they instituted these

718
00:40:26,951 --> 00:40:30,160
new easy pass toll plazas,
it reduced them by like 15% each.

719
00:40:30,430 --> 00:40:35,160
That's how dramatic just the exhaust
effect is on development of babies. Um,

720
00:40:35,620 --> 00:40:39,540
how much is an effect of electric
cars? Yeah, that could, I mean that,

721
00:40:39,640 --> 00:40:40,560
that will be right.
You know,

722
00:40:40,570 --> 00:40:45,130
it hasn't had enough of an effect because
there's not enough of them. Yeah. Um,

723
00:40:45,370 --> 00:40:49,310
and, but yeah, I mean,
that problem on the,

724
00:40:49,810 --> 00:40:51,940
unlike at the technological
level has been solved.

725
00:40:51,941 --> 00:40:53,980
We know how to replace
cars with electric cars.

726
00:40:54,220 --> 00:40:55,870
We can make them even pretty affordable,

727
00:40:55,871 --> 00:40:59,740
not quite as affordable as they need to
be, but the new Teslas are like 35 grand.

728
00:40:59,741 --> 00:41:03,560
I think if you get it down to
15 grants, that'll be, you know,

729
00:41:03,700 --> 00:41:04,600
that'll be a huge solution.

730
00:41:04,601 --> 00:41:06,520
But then there are a lot of other
problems that are more difficult.

731
00:41:06,521 --> 00:41:08,860
Like air travel.
You can't,

732
00:41:09,010 --> 00:41:13,150
we don't have electric planes around
the corner. You can't fly planes.

733
00:41:13,240 --> 00:41:16,000
Is there anything like that on the
horizon? There's some people who are,

734
00:41:16,180 --> 00:41:17,170
who are trying to develop it,

735
00:41:17,171 --> 00:41:20,740
but it seems like probably it's at
least like a decade away. And you know,

736
00:41:21,040 --> 00:41:26,040
one cross country flight in the u s is
the equivalent of one seat on one Costco

737
00:41:26,460 --> 00:41:28,720
cross country flight is the
equivalent of eight months of driving.

738
00:41:29,230 --> 00:41:33,040
Every time you fly from New York
to London and back, you melt nine,

739
00:41:33,560 --> 00:41:34,970
three square meters of ice.

740
00:41:35,090 --> 00:41:39,800
Every single seat on every flight from
New York to London melts three square

741
00:41:39,801 --> 00:41:43,430
meters of ice. Um, of octagon. Yeah.

742
00:41:44,180 --> 00:41:49,020
That's insane. That's real. Yeah. Yeah.

743
00:41:49,030 --> 00:41:51,710
I think it's heavy at the time
you fly across the country.

744
00:41:51,711 --> 00:41:55,850
It's like eight months
of driving. Yeah. Whoa.

745
00:41:55,910 --> 00:41:59,300
So globally air travel is only
2% of the carbon footprint.

746
00:41:59,301 --> 00:42:00,500
So it's relatively small,

747
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:03,920
but for people in especially
rich people in rich countries,

748
00:42:03,921 --> 00:42:07,340
it's a much bigger part of the foot
then fly around all but yeah, no,

749
00:42:07,341 --> 00:42:08,390
the average American,

750
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:13,160
I think the stat is the average American
every year amidst enough carbon to melt

751
00:42:13,430 --> 00:42:15,710
10,000 tons of ice.

752
00:42:17,460 --> 00:42:20,730
Jesus Christ.
That's just the average American.

753
00:42:22,420 --> 00:42:26,050
And if you're a person like me who
flies like every other weekend,

754
00:42:26,260 --> 00:42:29,780
it's way worse. Way Worse. Yeah. Oh,

755
00:42:30,250 --> 00:42:35,140
so holy Shit,
you put it in that perspective.

756
00:42:35,141 --> 00:42:39,220
It's how much fucking ice is there?
I mean, there's a lot of ice. Yeah.

757
00:42:39,250 --> 00:42:43,960
But it's going to melt. Well, that's how
you get the out. The outside projections,

758
00:42:43,961 --> 00:42:48,540
the high end projections for sea
level rise or 260 feet. No. Um,

759
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:53,620
the plus sign is, it's way better to
get hotter than it is to get colder.

760
00:42:53,680 --> 00:42:58,150
Right? Like ice ages kill everything.
Well the, you know, the, each of the,

761
00:42:58,180 --> 00:43:01,150
so there've been five mass extinctions
and planetary history in Earth's history

762
00:43:01,151 --> 00:43:04,090
before one of them was killed,
was caused by an asteroid,

763
00:43:04,450 --> 00:43:06,220
but the other four were um,

764
00:43:06,370 --> 00:43:10,360
were produced by global warming
related to greenhouse gas. Um,

765
00:43:11,110 --> 00:43:14,870
and one of them, the Ice Age, well,
the ice age doesn't count. It didn't,

766
00:43:14,890 --> 00:43:19,090
didn't kill as many know really the,
the biggest mass extinction,

767
00:43:19,091 --> 00:43:22,450
the end Permian extinction, which
is 250, 2 million years ago,

768
00:43:22,870 --> 00:43:26,680
90 to 95% of all life on earth died.

769
00:43:27,820 --> 00:43:32,290
When was that? 252 million years ago.
So each of these mass extinctions,

770
00:43:32,291 --> 00:43:36,160
basically it's like a complete slate
wiping of the evolutionary record.

771
00:43:36,161 --> 00:43:39,160
It's like we're starting over from
scratch. So we want to think that the,

772
00:43:39,161 --> 00:43:43,000
the asteroid that hit the Yucatan did
the most damage in terms of the fossil

773
00:43:43,001 --> 00:43:45,610
record. Is that not true?
Is the one that was the,

774
00:43:45,611 --> 00:43:47,860
the global warming was that
more? Well, this other,

775
00:43:47,930 --> 00:43:50,560
there are five and four of them were
from global warming and the worst,

776
00:43:50,590 --> 00:43:54,180
the worst one was just from, from
greenhouse gas warming. But yeah, the,

777
00:43:54,181 --> 00:43:56,650
the one that killed the
dinosaurs was also really bad.

778
00:43:56,651 --> 00:43:58,270
It was something like
70% of all life on it,

779
00:43:58,271 --> 00:44:02,320
but it's less than the one where there
was a temperature rise. Yeah. Wow.

780
00:44:02,350 --> 00:44:05,380
There was a, um, a volcano, this
is a little bit sketchy science,

781
00:44:05,381 --> 00:44:08,020
but there was a volcano explosion,
um,

782
00:44:08,080 --> 00:44:12,670
something like 30,000 years
ago or something. I don't
remember the exact dates,

783
00:44:12,671 --> 00:44:15,840
but that volcanoes can cool,
uh,

784
00:44:15,910 --> 00:44:18,040
global temperature for the same reason
we're talking about with suspending

785
00:44:18,041 --> 00:44:20,540
particles because it basically
clouds the atmosphere with, um,

786
00:44:21,100 --> 00:44:22,300
and it dropped global temperatures.

787
00:44:22,301 --> 00:44:27,250
I think it was two degrees and the human
population at the time then shrunk to

788
00:44:27,251 --> 00:44:30,020
7,000.
There was this incredible bottle of that.

789
00:44:30,100 --> 00:44:32,400
A bunch of times it's less
people didn't live on Nantucket

790
00:44:35,250 --> 00:44:36,630
and it just,
it just makes you see,

791
00:44:36,631 --> 00:44:39,870
like everything about the way that we
live on this planet is dependent on

792
00:44:39,871 --> 00:44:44,160
climate conditions. Yeah. Like we'll
figure a way to like have a civilization,

793
00:44:44,310 --> 00:44:45,870
but it will be transformed.

794
00:44:45,871 --> 00:44:48,640
It will be very different if the
world is four degrees warmer. Um,

795
00:44:48,960 --> 00:44:50,940
and you know,

796
00:44:51,930 --> 00:44:54,720
everything about the way that we take
for everything we take for granted today

797
00:44:54,721 --> 00:44:57,690
is like a permanent feature
of the modern world.

798
00:44:57,930 --> 00:45:02,700
I think we're going to learn is much
more precarious, much more unstable.

799
00:45:02,940 --> 00:45:06,450
Um, and yeah, like I
said earlier, you know,

800
00:45:07,230 --> 00:45:10,740
climates were stable for
all of human history. That's
how we were able to evolve.

801
00:45:10,741 --> 00:45:12,510
It's how we're able to invent agriculture.

802
00:45:12,810 --> 00:45:15,480
The part of the world where we did
invent agriculture in the Middle East,

803
00:45:15,750 --> 00:45:17,730
it's now getting almost
too hot to grow crops.

804
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:21,540
It's also going to be too hot to go to
Mecca for pilgrimage in just a couple of

805
00:45:21,541 --> 00:45:22,374
decades,

806
00:45:22,580 --> 00:45:27,580
whether it like we're entirely outside
of that window of temperatures,

807
00:45:27,840 --> 00:45:31,260
which means we're functionally now living
on an entirely different planet than

808
00:45:31,261 --> 00:45:34,110
humans ever lived on before.
And it's gonna keep changing.

809
00:45:34,350 --> 00:45:38,800
So by the time we get to two or three
or four degrees will be a living in a

810
00:45:38,820 --> 00:45:39,930
climate that's you know,

811
00:45:40,230 --> 00:45:45,230
two or three or four times as much
different as the one that whereas now from

812
00:45:45,301 --> 00:45:49,200
the one before the industrial
revolution and yeah,

813
00:45:49,230 --> 00:45:53,010
it's like those impacts could be
totally overwhelming and catastrophic.

814
00:45:53,520 --> 00:45:58,050
Now the Al Gore film is something
that scared a lot of people,

815
00:45:58,080 --> 00:46:02,070
but it was also very widely dismissed
by a lot of the people as well.

816
00:46:02,100 --> 00:46:04,080
How accurate was that movie?
I think it,

817
00:46:04,170 --> 00:46:08,850
it proved to be too sanguine it like
it didn't deal with a lot of extreme

818
00:46:08,851 --> 00:46:12,060
weather. I thought that stuff was far
away and I think this is one of the,

819
00:46:12,450 --> 00:46:15,180
one of the big shortcomings of
most writing about climate, most

820
00:46:16,740 --> 00:46:21,740
kind of communication about climate for
25 years is that we were told it was

821
00:46:22,231 --> 00:46:23,064
slow.

822
00:46:23,430 --> 00:46:28,430
We were told it was going to be coming
maybe at the scale of centuries,

823
00:46:29,670 --> 00:46:32,340
something we'd have to worry
about for our grandchildren.

824
00:46:32,880 --> 00:46:35,910
But when you realize that half of all the
damage we've done has been done in the

825
00:46:35,911 --> 00:46:39,600
last 30 years,
and you see already the extreme weather.

826
00:46:39,840 --> 00:46:43,530
We had a global he wave last summer,
totally unprecedented.

827
00:46:43,530 --> 00:46:48,360
People died in Canada. They died in
Russia, they died in the Middle East.

828
00:46:48,600 --> 00:46:49,980
The same season.

829
00:46:50,730 --> 00:46:55,620
3 million people were evacuated in China
from a typhoon unprecedented rains in

830
00:46:55,621 --> 00:46:58,890
Japan. We had multiple hurricanes
in the Caribbean all at once.

831
00:46:59,130 --> 00:47:01,530
There was an island in Hawaii,
east island, a small island,

832
00:47:01,531 --> 00:47:02,850
not one that most people have gone to,

833
00:47:02,851 --> 00:47:05,340
but got literally wiped
off the map by hurricane.

834
00:47:05,820 --> 00:47:09,480
They're thinking about inventing a new
category of hurricane category six.

835
00:47:10,170 --> 00:47:12,390
All of these impacts, um, were,

836
00:47:12,690 --> 00:47:16,890
are coming much faster than scientists
predicted even a decade or two ago.

837
00:47:17,160 --> 00:47:20,550
And so I think the first inconvenient
truth is a little too complacent,

838
00:47:20,940 --> 00:47:24,180
but Al Gore is also, you
know, I know him a little bit.

839
00:47:24,181 --> 00:47:28,110
I've talked to him a few times. He's,
I'm temperamentally, he's a technocrat.

840
00:47:28,350 --> 00:47:29,280
He's an optimist.

841
00:47:29,470 --> 00:47:33,520
He thinks market forces can solve all
this stuff and I don't even totally

842
00:47:33,521 --> 00:47:36,430
disagree with him. Um, I think that
market forces are really powerful.

843
00:47:36,730 --> 00:47:39,910
We've had a huge green energy
revolution in the US that's, you know,

844
00:47:40,060 --> 00:47:42,280
and had spillover effects
elsewhere in the world.

845
00:47:42,520 --> 00:47:46,240
So solar powers now cheaper than anybody
expected it would be a decade or two

846
00:47:46,241 --> 00:47:50,830
ago. Although it's also the case that we
haven't replaced any of our dirty energy

847
00:47:50,831 --> 00:47:52,300
with it.
We've just added to our capacity.

848
00:47:52,301 --> 00:47:57,250
So the ratio of renewable energy to
dirty energy is now the same as it was 40

849
00:47:57,251 --> 00:48:01,510
years ago. Who made no progress.
Um, why is that? Because we just,

850
00:48:01,690 --> 00:48:03,220
if we're like, rather than saying, oh,

851
00:48:03,221 --> 00:48:07,060
let's retire this coal plant and replace
it with a, you know, a wind farm,

852
00:48:07,270 --> 00:48:10,330
we think, oh, we'll have the coal plant
and the wind farm will have more energy.

853
00:48:11,120 --> 00:48:15,040
You know, we just grow the pie of
energy and this is unnecessary.

854
00:48:15,610 --> 00:48:17,830
It's not because there's
just a massive demand.

855
00:48:17,830 --> 00:48:20,650
Is it just because they don't
want to end that industry? Yeah,

856
00:48:20,651 --> 00:48:22,450
I mean there is a demand.
People like energy.

857
00:48:22,510 --> 00:48:26,110
Trump was talking about clean
coal and everybody was like,

858
00:48:26,111 --> 00:48:30,790
what the fuck are you talking about?
Clean coal? I mean, I think on some level,

859
00:48:30,910 --> 00:48:33,310
American policy is a red herring.

860
00:48:33,850 --> 00:48:38,620
The U S is 15% of global
emissions. Um, and we're falling.

861
00:48:39,310 --> 00:48:44,230
The future climate of the world will
be determined by China, by India,

862
00:48:44,260 --> 00:48:46,720
by sub Saharan Africa. Those are
carbon footprints that are growing.

863
00:48:46,721 --> 00:48:50,110
China's now almost twice as big a
carbon footprint as the u s and they're

864
00:48:50,111 --> 00:48:54,190
building all this infrastructure outside
of China that doesn't even count, um,

865
00:48:54,280 --> 00:48:57,220
in Asia and Africa, you know, the
belt and road, you know, this project.

866
00:48:57,230 --> 00:49:00,950
So basically taking the model that the
US had with like the Suez Canal and the

867
00:49:00,960 --> 00:49:05,140
Panama Canal and they're building the
infrastructure of the developing world.

868
00:49:05,440 --> 00:49:09,530
So recently they, they loaned, um,

869
00:49:09,610 --> 00:49:14,320
Kenya a huge amount of money
to build a new rail line,

870
00:49:14,560 --> 00:49:19,030
which was, it could being built with
Chinese workers. They built the rail line.

871
00:49:19,540 --> 00:49:22,330
Um, then they can, you
couldn't pay back the debt.

872
00:49:22,750 --> 00:49:27,750
So China is threatening to take over
the entire port of Mombasa as debt

873
00:49:28,271 --> 00:49:32,950
repayment. And this is like going on all
around the world. Highways across Africa,

874
00:49:32,951 --> 00:49:37,951
across Asia are being built by Chinese
workers as an in an effort to build a new

875
00:49:38,080 --> 00:49:40,780
m imperial infrastructure for themselves.

876
00:49:40,870 --> 00:49:45,070
And is the thought that they're doing
this in terms of setting up the debt in a

877
00:49:45,071 --> 00:49:49,000
way that's unpayable so that they
could take over. I, that's one motive.

878
00:49:49,090 --> 00:49:52,240
I think that the Kenya exam, but
they'd be happy if the deck got repaid.

879
00:49:52,510 --> 00:49:53,343
I think it's,
they're,

880
00:49:53,380 --> 00:49:58,380
they're stitching together an alternative
to the western infrastructure of trade

881
00:49:59,291 --> 00:50:00,100
and transit.

882
00:50:00,100 --> 00:50:04,780
They're basically stitching together an
entire second system of how the world

883
00:50:04,781 --> 00:50:07,990
will work, how the economy will work and
it will be conducted through their own

884
00:50:08,260 --> 00:50:11,740
infrastructure and through their own
ports and through their own airports.

885
00:50:12,100 --> 00:50:14,290
And that's being done
by their own standards.

886
00:50:14,291 --> 00:50:17,650
So China is now pouring more concrete,
um,

887
00:50:17,800 --> 00:50:19,450
every three years than the entire,

888
00:50:19,451 --> 00:50:22,990
than the u s poured in the entire
20th century. She's crying.

889
00:50:22,991 --> 00:50:25,870
If concrete work country, it would be
the world's third biggest carbon emitter.

890
00:50:27,440 --> 00:50:32,180
So the, the, the path of development
of these other countries, China, India,

891
00:50:32,181 --> 00:50:37,130
and sub Saharan Africa are really what's
going to be writing the story of the

892
00:50:37,131 --> 00:50:39,050
future.
America has a kind of,

893
00:50:39,290 --> 00:50:44,290
I think like a moral obligation to lead
because historically we had the biggest

894
00:50:44,720 --> 00:50:45,553
carbon footprint.

895
00:50:45,770 --> 00:50:49,250
But at the moment we're a relatively
small part of the problem and within the u

896
00:50:49,251 --> 00:50:54,020
s market forces are doing a lot of, are
making a lot of progress for us. Um,

897
00:50:54,830 --> 00:50:59,830
so the real issue is how do we figure
out a new geopolitics that forces

898
00:51:00,591 --> 00:51:02,870
countries like China to act better?

899
00:51:03,350 --> 00:51:08,000
And one answer may be as weird as
it is to say that, um, you know,

900
00:51:08,001 --> 00:51:09,710
Xi Jinping is basically a dictator.

901
00:51:10,760 --> 00:51:13,460
If he wants to impose new standards,

902
00:51:13,461 --> 00:51:15,530
if he wants to invest
aggressively in green energy,

903
00:51:16,460 --> 00:51:19,460
he doesn't have any of the AHP political
obstacles that we have in the u s and

904
00:51:19,461 --> 00:51:23,690
so there's this sort of weird sympathy
among American climate people for that,

905
00:51:24,220 --> 00:51:28,130
um, authoritarianism. And he has,

906
00:51:28,131 --> 00:51:29,780
especially since Trump has been elected,

907
00:51:30,770 --> 00:51:34,160
being a lot more aggressive talking about
climate because he sees if America's

908
00:51:34,161 --> 00:51:34,941
not going to be leading,

909
00:51:34,941 --> 00:51:38,990
this is an opportunity for China to
be like the real face of climate.

910
00:51:39,650 --> 00:51:43,250
And that means they've paid, you
know, they've invested a ton in,

911
00:51:43,251 --> 00:51:46,310
in solar and wind.
They've done a lot with air pollution.

912
00:51:46,310 --> 00:51:50,870
So Beijing used to be really awful in
2013 they more than a million Chinese

913
00:51:50,871 --> 00:51:55,160
people died of air pollution
and now that's much better.
Um, what have they done?

914
00:51:56,290 --> 00:52:00,800
Just imposing stricter standards
on, um, on pollution, emissions,

915
00:52:01,610 --> 00:52:05,690
coal plants, things like that kind
of stuff. Yeah. And um, but you know,

916
00:52:05,691 --> 00:52:09,020
we think about, we think about
carbon and the whole problem,

917
00:52:09,230 --> 00:52:12,080
I think a little too
much in terms of energy.

918
00:52:12,500 --> 00:52:15,440
Energy is just 30% of the
global carbon footprint.

919
00:52:15,470 --> 00:52:18,260
And it's the easiest one to solve
because wind and solar is actually really

920
00:52:18,320 --> 00:52:20,960
cheap. Now. Most parts of the
world is cheaper than dirty energy.

921
00:52:21,020 --> 00:52:25,040
What's the majority of the footprint?
Well, it's all, nothing's a majority.

922
00:52:25,400 --> 00:52:29,980
So there's energy, there's infrastructure,
there's transportation. Um,

923
00:52:30,210 --> 00:52:33,140
and agriculture is like a
huge underappreciated part
of it. It's something like,

924
00:52:33,320 --> 00:52:36,420
I don't know, 30% of the
global footprint. Um,

925
00:52:36,600 --> 00:52:40,400
is it because of tractors or what does
it recover? Everything. Everything.

926
00:52:40,430 --> 00:52:42,260
Everything that you need
to do to run a farm.

927
00:52:42,320 --> 00:52:44,990
I mean really everything you
need to do to live in the world.

928
00:52:45,060 --> 00:52:47,480
It has some kind of carbon footprint.
But you know,

929
00:52:47,481 --> 00:52:51,470
if we were able to like
feed all our cattle seaweed,
that would have like a big,

930
00:52:51,530 --> 00:52:55,540
that would have a big impact. Um,
but all kinds of crops have, um,

931
00:52:55,610 --> 00:52:57,020
have carbon footprints and they,

932
00:52:57,021 --> 00:53:01,460
but they would still have to do
something to get the seaweed and have the

933
00:53:01,461 --> 00:53:05,890
seaweed travel, the seaweed to deliver it
to these farms. Well, you could also do,

934
00:53:05,910 --> 00:53:09,170
you know, you can imagine lab grown meat
having a much smaller carbon footprint.

935
00:53:09,230 --> 00:53:14,060
Um, I mean, it should, if it like
proceeds as we expect it will. Um,

936
00:53:14,660 --> 00:53:17,150
and like I said before, like when
you look at each particular threat,

937
00:53:17,151 --> 00:53:19,790
there's like, you can see reasons
for optimism. You can see like, oh,

938
00:53:19,791 --> 00:53:21,590
we'll figure it out in this way.
We'll figure it out in that way.

939
00:53:22,100 --> 00:53:27,100
But the UN says we need to have all of
our global emissions by 2030 to have a

940
00:53:29,161 --> 00:53:33,330
chance of a Verdin two degrees of warming,
which they call catastrophic warming.

941
00:53:34,230 --> 00:53:39,230
And the projects that we need to put into
place in those 11 years are just much

942
00:53:41,251 --> 00:53:43,650
bigger than I think we're
capable of pulling off.

943
00:53:43,980 --> 00:53:48,980
They say the UN says what is necessary
is a global mobilization at the level of

944
00:53:51,631 --> 00:53:55,200
World War II against
climate starting this year,

945
00:53:55,530 --> 00:54:00,530
2019 and there's just no chance to
work in to do that anytime soon.

946
00:54:01,020 --> 00:54:05,700
I mean, maybe 10 years from now we'll get
there. That may even be optimistic. Um,

947
00:54:06,150 --> 00:54:11,150
but the total decarbonisation that's
required is we need to totally zero out on

948
00:54:11,461 --> 00:54:15,510
carbon by 2050 they say. Um,
and I just think, you know,

949
00:54:15,570 --> 00:54:18,810
a lot of these sectors are much trickier.

950
00:54:19,320 --> 00:54:21,090
We could maybe zero out on energy,

951
00:54:21,540 --> 00:54:24,810
zero out on carbon when it comes to
energy in 15 years if we want it to.

952
00:54:24,811 --> 00:54:28,740
But again, that's just 30%
of the total problem. Um,

953
00:54:28,830 --> 00:54:31,140
which is why I think there's
the negative emission stuff,

954
00:54:31,141 --> 00:54:35,850
the carbon capture so important because
it will allow us to move more slowly

955
00:54:36,030 --> 00:54:39,570
than the UN says we need to.
And still if it works out,

956
00:54:41,010 --> 00:54:45,730
you know, keep the planet relatively
stable, relatively livable. Um,

957
00:54:45,780 --> 00:54:48,450
but that's, you know, those
technologies have been called magical,

958
00:54:48,750 --> 00:54:51,960
magical thinking by the journal Nature,

959
00:54:51,990 --> 00:54:55,470
which is like the biggest scientific
journal, um, writing about this stuff.

960
00:54:55,471 --> 00:54:59,040
So it's sort of a leap of faith to think
that they could solve that problem.

961
00:54:59,920 --> 00:55:04,300
Do you think that we're dealing with
like shifts in degrees of perception that

962
00:55:04,420 --> 00:55:09,100
it, it is things like your book,
things like Al Gore's movie,

963
00:55:09,101 --> 00:55:10,120
things like,
you know,

964
00:55:10,121 --> 00:55:13,390
anytime there's a new story that's
written in the New York Times or in any,

965
00:55:13,391 --> 00:55:16,510
any periodical,
we need more of this.

966
00:55:16,511 --> 00:55:19,130
It needs to be hammered home
to people that it's neat.

967
00:55:19,160 --> 00:55:23,020
It needs to be something that's a
global discussion that accelerates.

968
00:55:23,390 --> 00:55:27,110
Totally. And I think that that's
happening. You know, I think, um,

969
00:55:27,380 --> 00:55:31,490
there was this big report that the UN
did in October that spurred a lot of

970
00:55:31,491 --> 00:55:35,510
conversation about it.
And I think in a grotesque way,

971
00:55:36,050 --> 00:55:38,840
the best teacher is just extreme weather.
You know,

972
00:55:39,110 --> 00:55:43,730
when you see every year these California
wildfires, every year they're burning.

973
00:55:44,600 --> 00:55:45,860
And that is really dramatic.

974
00:55:45,861 --> 00:55:49,160
People I talked to in Europe are
focused on the California fires,

975
00:55:49,161 --> 00:55:50,260
even though they have
wildfires over there.

976
00:55:50,261 --> 00:55:52,310
There's something we had the California
fires that they're really worried about

977
00:55:52,760 --> 00:55:54,110
when you see these global heat waves,

978
00:55:54,111 --> 00:55:56,960
when you see unprecedented
hurricane seasons,

979
00:55:57,050 --> 00:55:59,120
we just had the typhoon in
the Pacific in February,

980
00:55:59,180 --> 00:56:02,270
first time in recorded
history. Um, you know,

981
00:56:02,271 --> 00:56:06,760
when every day on the news there's
some, um, there's some, you know,

982
00:56:06,800 --> 00:56:10,700
dramatic extreme weather and when
they come one after the other,

983
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:14,690
I think that's a really powerful
teaching tool. So, you know, there's,

984
00:56:14,691 --> 00:56:18,920
this term is now outdated,
but 500 year storm,

985
00:56:18,921 --> 00:56:22,940
you hear a lot about 500 year
storm means, you know, a,

986
00:56:23,830 --> 00:56:28,720
that would hit a particular area
once every five centuries, right?

987
00:56:29,020 --> 00:56:32,440
That means five centuries ago there
were no white people in America.

988
00:56:32,890 --> 00:56:37,870
So that means we're talking about a storm
that would hump come once as colonists

989
00:56:37,871 --> 00:56:40,720
came to America as they,
you know,

990
00:56:40,960 --> 00:56:44,500
committed genocide against
native Americans as they
built their own empire, say,

991
00:56:44,560 --> 00:56:48,280
built an empire of slaves and
cotton as they fought a civil war.

992
00:56:48,400 --> 00:56:51,280
They fought world war one's, they fought
World War II. Everything that we've done,

993
00:56:51,460 --> 00:56:56,320
we'd expect one, one storm
of that kind. In that time,

994
00:56:57,310 --> 00:57:02,310
hurricane Harvey was the third 500 year
storm to hit Houston in three years.

995
00:57:03,540 --> 00:57:08,540
We are living in such
unprecedented climate that
it's impossible to look at the

996
00:57:09,581 --> 00:57:14,581
news and not learn that despite
all of our inclinations,

997
00:57:14,891 --> 00:57:18,040
all of our reflexes to look away,
I think it is seeping in.

998
00:57:18,250 --> 00:57:21,520
I think people are beginning to be more
alarmed about it and I think alarm is

999
00:57:21,521 --> 00:57:24,520
really useful. There are people in the
climbing community who think, you know,

1000
00:57:24,521 --> 00:57:27,400
it's, it's dangerous to scare
people. It turns them off.

1001
00:57:27,401 --> 00:57:30,640
But I'm somebody who's
awakened to this out of fear.

1002
00:57:31,300 --> 00:57:33,670
And when I look at the history
of environmental activism,

1003
00:57:33,671 --> 00:57:36,580
when I look at activism generally it's
like we don't try to get people to stop

1004
00:57:36,581 --> 00:57:39,280
smoking cigarettes by like
messaging through optimism.

1005
00:57:39,610 --> 00:57:42,130
We tried to get them to stop because we
tell them how bad it's going to be for

1006
00:57:42,131 --> 00:57:45,160
them. Drunk driving, nuclear
proliferation. Same thing.

1007
00:57:45,610 --> 00:57:48,880
Rachel Carson wrote silent
spring about pesticides.

1008
00:57:48,970 --> 00:57:50,530
It was called hyperbolic alarmist.

1009
00:57:51,040 --> 00:57:54,820
It led to the creation of the EPA and
you know when you think about that UN

1010
00:57:54,821 --> 00:57:58,540
directive that we should be mobilizing
at the scale of World War II to come back

1011
00:57:58,541 --> 00:58:01,570
climate.
We then fight World War II out of hope.

1012
00:58:01,630 --> 00:58:06,630
We fought world war two out of panic and
I think that that should be part of how

1013
00:58:07,331 --> 00:58:10,900
we think about this story.
Obviously I think, you know,

1014
00:58:10,901 --> 00:58:14,170
when I look around the world, when I talk
to anyone, when I talked to my family,

1015
00:58:14,171 --> 00:58:16,720
when I watch TV, when I watch
moot, whatever, read stuff,

1016
00:58:17,230 --> 00:58:20,830
it just seems obvious to me that there
are many more people who are still too

1017
00:58:20,831 --> 00:58:23,950
complacent about this issue. Even if
they're concerned about it a little bit.

1018
00:58:23,951 --> 00:58:26,180
Even if they're aware of it.
Um,

1019
00:58:26,290 --> 00:58:30,280
they don't think of it as like the
overarching all encompassing story of our

1020
00:58:30,281 --> 00:58:34,480
time that requires an
existential response.

1021
00:58:34,780 --> 00:58:39,100
And even saying those words make me
uncomfortable because I like, it's hard.

1022
00:58:39,370 --> 00:58:42,700
It's hard for me to believe that the sky,
the threat is that big,

1023
00:58:42,970 --> 00:58:46,510
but that is what the science
says. Um, and like I said before,

1024
00:58:46,511 --> 00:58:47,980
some of that science is
not going to get born out,

1025
00:58:47,981 --> 00:58:52,510
but when you look at the full scope
of it and just how, just how large,

1026
00:58:53,020 --> 00:58:56,830
just how bleak the impacts will be,
you realize like,

1027
00:58:56,920 --> 00:59:00,640
we really need to wake up to just how
dangerous a world we're heading into and

1028
00:59:00,641 --> 00:59:02,620
do everything we can to avoid it.
Um,

1029
00:59:02,650 --> 00:59:06,070
in addition to probably planning to adapt.

1030
00:59:06,880 --> 00:59:09,640
Now you live in New York where
you live in, in New York,

1031
00:59:09,641 --> 00:59:14,290
when Tribeca flooded a few years ago.
Yeah. What was that like? Well, I mean,

1032
00:59:14,291 --> 00:59:16,930
I think in a situation like that,
um,

1033
00:59:18,220 --> 00:59:23,120
most people emerge from a
particular disaster. Think, my God,

1034
00:59:23,121 --> 00:59:27,140
since this is so awful,
it must be an anomaly.

1035
00:59:28,370 --> 00:59:32,540
And you know, I think New York was
really horrified as a city by Sandy,

1036
00:59:33,080 --> 00:59:36,980
but there's going to be, sandy is,

1037
00:59:37,280 --> 00:59:38,720
I don't remember the exact stat,

1038
00:59:38,750 --> 00:59:42,260
like once every five years
by category storm Sandy,

1039
00:59:42,500 --> 00:59:47,070
I think it made landfall as a category
three so it's not even a five. Yeah.

1040
00:59:47,300 --> 00:59:51,080
So if a five hidden, is it possible for
five to hit New York as a too far north?

1041
00:59:51,081 --> 00:59:52,700
No, as possible. Totally possible.

1042
00:59:52,730 --> 00:59:56,660
I was talking to a really prominent
climate scientist a few months ago who is

1043
00:59:56,661 --> 01:00:00,880
like one of the, he was one of the
lead authors on the, the UN report, um,

1044
01:00:01,280 --> 01:00:03,980
lives in New York, does a lot of
consulting with the city. And I said,

1045
01:00:04,880 --> 01:00:08,360
so we're going to build a sea wall
to protect New York from flooding.

1046
01:00:09,140 --> 01:00:11,480
And he was like, oh, absolutely.
You know, Manhattan real estate,

1047
01:00:11,481 --> 01:00:15,200
it's way too expensive to let flood.
So we'll definitely build a seawall.

1048
01:00:15,290 --> 01:00:19,760
But an infrastructure project like that,
it takes at least 30 years to build.

1049
01:00:20,510 --> 01:00:21,710
And if we started right now,

1050
01:00:22,640 --> 01:00:26,270
we wouldn't be able to finish in time to
save Howard beach and parts of Brooklyn

1051
01:00:26,271 --> 01:00:30,710
and Queens. We started
right now, he said, he said,

1052
01:00:30,711 --> 01:00:34,550
the city knows this and you'll
see in the next few years,

1053
01:00:34,820 --> 01:00:36,830
they'll stop doing
repairs on infrastructure.

1054
01:00:37,190 --> 01:00:40,310
They'll stop attending to the subway
lines and those neighborhoods.

1055
01:00:40,670 --> 01:00:41,960
And even a few years after that,

1056
01:00:41,961 --> 01:00:44,210
they'll start staying explicitly
to the people who live there.

1057
01:00:44,600 --> 01:00:47,870
You might be able to continue living
in these homes for a couple of decades,

1058
01:00:48,080 --> 01:00:51,620
but you're not going to be able to live
them, leave them to your kids. Whoa.

1059
01:00:51,980 --> 01:00:52,761
This is in New York City.

1060
01:00:52,761 --> 01:00:55,250
It's like the richest country in
the richest city in the world.

1061
01:00:55,760 --> 01:00:58,820
And he a huge parts of,
um,

1062
01:00:58,850 --> 01:01:02,480
huge parts of southern Brooklyn and
Queens are going to be underwater.

1063
01:01:02,510 --> 01:01:06,770
So for the people that live there right
now, what parts are you talking about? Um,

1064
01:01:06,920 --> 01:01:09,800
well, the one that, the
one that he mentioned most
explicitly was Howard beach,

1065
01:01:09,801 --> 01:01:11,930
but, um, which is, it's
kind of an interest.

1066
01:01:11,931 --> 01:01:16,250
It's like a mob neighborhood and you
know, it's still, yeah. Really well.

1067
01:01:16,640 --> 01:01:20,270
Yeah. Yeah. That cause that was like
the Gotti neighborhood, right? Yeah.

1068
01:01:20,271 --> 01:01:22,910
That's where they buried
all the dead bodies. Wow.

1069
01:01:23,360 --> 01:01:25,850
I didn't know that was still a
mob neighborhood. Well, you know,

1070
01:01:25,851 --> 01:01:28,970
to the extent that there
is a mob. Yeah. Um,

1071
01:01:29,630 --> 01:01:34,190
and yeah, I mean that's true
everywhere on the coast, everywhere.

1072
01:01:34,430 --> 01:01:37,100
It's not just New York. New
York's not exceptional. You know,

1073
01:01:37,101 --> 01:01:41,840
their projections that like $30 billion
of New Jersey real estate could be

1074
01:01:41,841 --> 01:01:45,380
underwater by 20, 30, 20, 30.
Why does that not as alarming

1075
01:01:48,900 --> 01:01:52,810
was born in New Jersey. It's
not as alarming. And then,
you know, Miami beaches,

1076
01:01:52,880 --> 01:01:57,620
you know, Miami beach has done for, yeah.
Miami beach is almost inevitable. Correct?

1077
01:01:57,680 --> 01:02:01,380
Yeah. Yeah. I mean, you know,
they could, they could build
a seawall, but that, those,

1078
01:02:01,440 --> 01:02:03,390
that's not going to help because
of the, the ground. Right.

1079
01:02:03,710 --> 01:02:07,100
And it's just so expensive.
So you really have to, um,

1080
01:02:07,130 --> 01:02:10,310
you really have to pick your poison and
then when you look around the world,

1081
01:02:10,311 --> 01:02:13,160
you know,
it's like Bangladesh,

1082
01:02:13,400 --> 01:02:15,620
that country's going to be
almost entirely underwater.

1083
01:02:16,190 --> 01:02:20,220
That's hundreds of millions of people.
If we wanted to build a sea wall,

1084
01:02:20,760 --> 01:02:24,030
they can't afford that. Who's going to
afford, who's going to pay for that?

1085
01:02:24,090 --> 01:02:28,560
And this is all because of the raising
sea level because of the melting ice,

1086
01:02:28,590 --> 01:02:31,400
because of the temperature and all of
this is happening. And I think, you know,

1087
01:02:31,410 --> 01:02:34,650
we think of sea level is really a
thing that happens on the coastline,

1088
01:02:34,651 --> 01:02:35,880
which it is primarily,

1089
01:02:36,120 --> 01:02:40,350
but it also increases flooding on rivers
because the water is all connected of

1090
01:02:40,351 --> 01:02:40,681
course.

1091
01:02:40,681 --> 01:02:45,681
So flooding in the UK is expected to
grow 50 folds by the end of the century.

1092
01:02:46,560 --> 01:02:51,060
What? Well that life d
fold London is already like
underwater a couple of times a

1093
01:02:51,061 --> 01:02:53,970
year. I mean not the whole city, but
what does this Jamie, this is Bangladesh.

1094
01:02:53,971 --> 01:02:58,920
I just went to oh no, dash
under water. She's like a
video that pops up. Oh my God.

1095
01:02:58,921 --> 01:03:02,280
These people are fucked. Yeah. It
says 18 million residents live here.

1096
01:03:02,310 --> 01:03:05,310
That's a swamp. Yeah.
That looks crazy. Like it.

1097
01:03:05,460 --> 01:03:08,570
Like if you are a real estate projector
and you're flying over that, uh, yeah,

1098
01:03:08,571 --> 01:03:11,540
yeah, yeah. We can't build here. Yeah.
Jakarta will be totally underwater.

1099
01:03:11,650 --> 01:03:14,220
[inaudible] apartment buildings.
Like you could see the water level.

1100
01:03:14,221 --> 01:03:16,640
Look back up a little bit.
This is just a running little,

1101
01:03:17,040 --> 01:03:21,000
but if you see it look at like doesn't
that look like a water level and the the

1102
01:03:21,001 --> 01:03:24,190
apartment buildings in the right hand
side near where your cursor is like,

1103
01:03:24,780 --> 01:03:29,780
like that's going to go up to where
that orange level is fucking Christ.

1104
01:03:29,850 --> 01:03:33,930
Well, I mean over millennia where
they're going to rise hundreds of feet.

1105
01:03:34,170 --> 01:03:35,070
Oh God.

1106
01:03:35,430 --> 01:03:37,800
I mean it's going to take a long time
so you can adjust to that a little bit.

1107
01:03:37,801 --> 01:03:41,520
But um, but that's always been
the case, right? The, the,

1108
01:03:41,610 --> 01:03:43,440
I mean they're still fine.

1109
01:03:43,470 --> 01:03:48,470
They find these artifacts and things in
the middle of the ocean in areas where

1110
01:03:49,351 --> 01:03:52,860
people used to be able to live and
now they can't live anymore. Yeah.

1111
01:03:53,640 --> 01:03:56,970
I think that'll be, we have
to move, people have to
move. So what's a good spot?

1112
01:03:57,000 --> 01:04:00,890
Alberta? Good. Anyone
anywhere off the tin? Yeah.

1113
01:04:01,050 --> 01:04:02,340
That's the spot now.
I mean,

1114
01:04:02,341 --> 01:04:05,460
I think I would like ask me that
all the time and I say, you know,

1115
01:04:05,461 --> 01:04:09,210
honestly the place that I would move
to is somewhere in Scandinavia really?

1116
01:04:09,240 --> 01:04:13,200
Because, um, you know, I talked about
the impact of economic growth before,

1117
01:04:13,201 --> 01:04:15,300
but they're going to
be parts of the world,

1118
01:04:15,301 --> 01:04:18,720
the benefit economically from this
anywhere in the north. So Canada,

1119
01:04:18,721 --> 01:04:22,980
Russia and Scandinavia will benefit
because, but why don't go to Scandinavia,

1120
01:04:23,010 --> 01:04:27,120
go to Canada. It's right there. Well
let's get the navy yard at me. Yeah.

1121
01:04:27,190 --> 01:04:31,110
I mean I can, Scandinavia is nice,
but Canada is like our neighbors,

1122
01:04:31,140 --> 01:04:31,973
although they also,

1123
01:04:32,340 --> 01:04:36,840
they have wildfires there to Canada and
in the Arctic Circle and Finley tells us

1124
01:04:36,880 --> 01:04:41,050
bears and outlines. But
so you know, these guys,

1125
01:04:41,070 --> 01:04:43,080
the economist who studied
this stuff say that, um,

1126
01:04:43,110 --> 01:04:45,960
there is actually an optimal
temperature for human productivity.

1127
01:04:46,530 --> 01:04:47,700
It's 13 degrees Celsius,

1128
01:04:47,701 --> 01:04:50,670
which is the historical media and
temperature of the u s it's also the

1129
01:04:50,671 --> 01:04:53,490
historical media in temperature
of Germany. What is 13 Celsius?

1130
01:04:53,491 --> 01:04:55,690
Was that 60 degrees or
something like that? Yeah,

1131
01:04:55,730 --> 01:04:57,030
I think it's like in the high fifties.

1132
01:04:59,750 --> 01:05:00,590
Well,
we've got Jamie,

1133
01:05:02,650 --> 01:05:07,260
Google doesn't give it to you
whenever I'm in Canada.

1134
01:05:07,261 --> 01:05:09,840
I'm always like, I don't know what you're
saying. Yeah. They were like, Holy Shit,

1135
01:05:09,841 --> 01:05:12,810
it's 22 degrees, 55. Um,

1136
01:05:13,350 --> 01:05:17,980
and so for every degree
north of that you lose about

1137
01:05:17,980 --> 01:05:19,090
a percentage point of GDP.

1138
01:05:19,091 --> 01:05:24,091
So the US is now at about 13 and a
half a degree Celsius at a median

1139
01:05:24,461 --> 01:05:24,821
temperature.

1140
01:05:24,821 --> 01:05:28,180
That means that we're losing about a
half percentage point of GDP every year

1141
01:05:28,181 --> 01:05:29,014
from it.

1142
01:05:29,170 --> 01:05:33,310
But there are parts of the u s that were
cooler than 13 and are now brought up

1143
01:05:33,311 --> 01:05:38,230
to this optimal level. Silicon valley is
like exactly at 13 degrees right now. Um,

1144
01:05:38,260 --> 01:05:42,050
which is, you know, notable cause
they're like super productive. Yeah.

1145
01:05:42,460 --> 01:05:45,310
And that's going to be, so that'll
be true for Scandinavian generally.

1146
01:05:45,311 --> 01:05:48,820
And it may be part of the explanation
why there's been so much economic

1147
01:05:48,821 --> 01:05:51,640
productivity and Scandinavia of the last
generation is that they have already

1148
01:05:52,450 --> 01:05:54,070
started doing better with temperature.

1149
01:05:54,220 --> 01:05:56,380
Crops are going to be
more bountiful in Russia.

1150
01:05:56,400 --> 01:05:59,740
Like Russia will have better
agriculture because of global warming,

1151
01:06:00,280 --> 01:06:02,860
which is why they, they make
such a, you know, there,

1152
01:06:02,861 --> 01:06:07,861
there is such a complicated figure in
the geopolitical story about climate.

1153
01:06:08,110 --> 01:06:09,220
So they are a petro state.

1154
01:06:09,221 --> 01:06:11,890
They have almost all of their economic
activity activity has to do with burning

1155
01:06:11,980 --> 01:06:14,710
oil, but they're also poised
to benefit from warming.

1156
01:06:14,711 --> 01:06:19,090
So they're doubly motivated to produce
more global warming and they have such a

1157
01:06:19,180 --> 01:06:21,880
fuck the rest of the world perspective
that they're not going to stop.

1158
01:06:22,180 --> 01:06:24,580
Whereas Canada probably
they're like likely to,

1159
01:06:24,610 --> 01:06:26,050
even though they'd
benefit from more warming,

1160
01:06:26,051 --> 01:06:30,360
they'll probably get on board with any
program to avert warming. But that is a,

1161
01:06:30,361 --> 01:06:33,940
um, that's a dilemma that
faces every nation. You know,

1162
01:06:33,941 --> 01:06:37,060
like Justin Trudeau gets,
you know,

1163
01:06:37,330 --> 01:06:40,090
talks a lot of shit about Donald
Trump and his climate policy. But he,

1164
01:06:40,150 --> 01:06:43,930
Justin Trudeau's also approving new
pipelines on Glen. Marco does the same,

1165
01:06:44,110 --> 01:06:46,020
but she is retiring,
um,

1166
01:06:46,150 --> 01:06:51,040
nuclear so quickly in Germany that
they're having to use dirty energy. Um,

1167
01:06:51,160 --> 01:06:54,220
and even though they've had this
incredible green energy revolution there,

1168
01:06:54,610 --> 01:06:59,320
their emissions are going up. Um,
and every country in the world is,

1169
01:06:59,410 --> 01:07:00,760
it's a collective action problem.

1170
01:07:00,790 --> 01:07:05,710
Every country in the world is incentivized
to behave badly and let the rest of

1171
01:07:05,711 --> 01:07:06,790
the world clean up the mess.

1172
01:07:07,090 --> 01:07:09,370
So I was talking to this guy yesterday
about wildfires and he was like, you know,

1173
01:07:09,430 --> 01:07:14,050
California is doing so great, you know,
with all of the emission standards,

1174
01:07:14,051 --> 01:07:15,100
they're basically,
you know,

1175
01:07:15,250 --> 01:07:18,610
holding themselves to the Paris accords
even though the country as a whole isn't,

1176
01:07:19,180 --> 01:07:23,350
but that impact isn't local.
It's global. So it's dissipated.

1177
01:07:23,920 --> 01:07:27,360
The temperature impact on California
wildfires will be determined by it.

1178
01:07:27,370 --> 01:07:32,260
Like I said earlier, basically what
China does. So in terms of, you know,

1179
01:07:32,620 --> 01:07:35,680
what any individual area would any,
any individual nation is doing,

1180
01:07:35,980 --> 01:07:38,170
the motivations are really,
really complicated there.

1181
01:07:38,171 --> 01:07:42,070
And in California in particular,
this is a bit of a tangent, but, um,

1182
01:07:43,150 --> 01:07:46,510
you know, the state has done incredible
stuff with emission standards,

1183
01:07:46,570 --> 01:07:49,060
fuel efficiency,
green energy,

1184
01:07:50,050 --> 01:07:55,050
and yet all of those gains now are wiped
out every year by the fires because

1185
01:07:56,891 --> 01:07:58,930
fires are trees,

1186
01:07:59,050 --> 01:08:03,310
trees or burning trees are basically
coal in the sense that they are stored

1187
01:08:03,311 --> 01:08:06,160
carbon when they burn,
they release carbon into the atmosphere.

1188
01:08:06,490 --> 01:08:09,280
So every time there are wildfires like
they were last year in California,

1189
01:08:09,610 --> 01:08:13,360
it literally wipes out all of the
progress that the state made in all of its

1190
01:08:13,361 --> 01:08:16,190
green initiatives that year.
Um,

1191
01:08:17,410 --> 01:08:17,880
okay.

1192
01:08:17,880 --> 01:08:22,680
Yeah. And you know about,
in, in, in Brazil, the, um,

1193
01:08:23,430 --> 01:08:27,090
the president of Brazil wants to
like basically de forest, the Amazon,

1194
01:08:27,360 --> 01:08:31,680
the Amazon is responsible for something
like 30% of the world's oxygen, um,

1195
01:08:31,800 --> 01:08:36,510
and is a huge sum. All plants obviously
absorb carbon and produce oxygen.

1196
01:08:36,800 --> 01:08:41,100
Um, so plant life is really good
for fighting climate change.

1197
01:08:41,101 --> 01:08:44,790
When you say he wants a divorce, the
Amazon, like at what scale, what does he,

1198
01:08:44,791 --> 01:08:45,810
what does he talk about doing?

1199
01:08:45,870 --> 01:08:48,640
So the scientist who studies
his proposal say that, um,

1200
01:08:48,690 --> 01:08:53,690
his plans would be the equivalent
of adding over a 10 year period,

1201
01:08:54,840 --> 01:08:58,380
adding a second China to the
world's global footprint.

1202
01:09:00,540 --> 01:09:05,310
Jesus Christ. Yeah. And this is just
a pump up Brazil's economy. Yeah.

1203
01:09:05,550 --> 01:09:08,820
Well he has a kind of a trumpy like
I'm gonna fuck the environmentalist's

1204
01:09:08,821 --> 01:09:13,440
perspective too. So he's just like a
little bit like, you know, whatever.

1205
01:09:13,441 --> 01:09:15,510
Flipping the bird to
people who care about it

1206
01:09:17,190 --> 01:09:19,920
and then just makes you think that like,
it seems crazy now,

1207
01:09:20,580 --> 01:09:22,320
but it really won't be crazy.

1208
01:09:22,321 --> 01:09:27,321
I think a generation from now for another
country to threaten at least sanctions

1209
01:09:27,600 --> 01:09:31,530
and maybe military action to deal with
that. You know, after World War Two,

1210
01:09:32,010 --> 01:09:34,980
we built a whole liberal international
order around the principle of human

1211
01:09:34,981 --> 01:09:35,814
rights.

1212
01:09:35,850 --> 01:09:39,390
That would have been unthinkable in
the 20th and yet it led to a series of

1213
01:09:39,391 --> 01:09:42,390
military invent interventions
over the next century,

1214
01:09:42,390 --> 01:09:45,720
half century because people were
behaving badly toward thrown citizens.

1215
01:09:45,900 --> 01:09:48,180
If we could do that.
It doesn't seem all that crazy to me,

1216
01:09:48,181 --> 01:09:53,181
that say 30 years from now unempowered
imperial China looking at someone like

1217
01:09:53,251 --> 01:09:57,090
Boston Arland Brazil would just be like,
no, you can't do that. I'm just gonna.

1218
01:09:57,120 --> 01:10:01,050
We're just gonna go in and
like take you out. Yeah. Um,

1219
01:10:01,140 --> 01:10:04,590
and this is what I mean when I say it's
a kind of all encompassing all impacting

1220
01:10:04,920 --> 01:10:09,480
threat. Our politics will be shaped by
it or geopolitics will be shaped by it.

1221
01:10:09,540 --> 01:10:11,940
Our, you know, everything
will be shaped by it.

1222
01:10:12,510 --> 01:10:16,320
We could have climate wars like in the
not too distant future. Jesus Christ.

1223
01:10:17,350 --> 01:10:21,780
How is this being received? The book,
Yeah. Are People, people resisting him?

1224
01:10:21,840 --> 01:10:25,050
Is there any anybody that wants to
debate you on this? So I, you know,

1225
01:10:25,051 --> 01:10:27,570
I wrote this article a couple
of years ago that produced,

1226
01:10:27,630 --> 01:10:29,550
I mean it was a huge
sort of viral phenomenon,

1227
01:10:29,551 --> 01:10:33,480
but it produced also some scientific
criticism and um, you know,

1228
01:10:33,481 --> 01:10:36,300
we published a fully annotated version
where every single lot we showed where

1229
01:10:36,301 --> 01:10:37,470
every single line came from,

1230
01:10:37,800 --> 01:10:42,180
but there were still scientists who were
arguing about whether the messaging was

1231
01:10:42,540 --> 01:10:46,830
precisely calibrated, whether
it was too bleak to dark. Um,

1232
01:10:47,820 --> 01:10:51,210
the book has had none of that.
I mean, it's, first of all,

1233
01:10:51,211 --> 01:10:55,230
it's been the best at first week it was
on the times bestseller list number six.

1234
01:10:55,240 --> 01:10:59,260
It's bestseller in England. It's
been in the Amazon top 10. Um,

1235
01:10:59,490 --> 01:11:02,820
and all of the reviews have been really,
um,

1236
01:11:03,240 --> 01:11:04,950
I think this goes to what
you were saying before.

1237
01:11:04,951 --> 01:11:06,390
I think like the conversation is changing.

1238
01:11:06,391 --> 01:11:08,820
People are actually really interested in

1239
01:11:10,350 --> 01:11:14,790
talking seriously about just how a deal
this is in a way that they might not

1240
01:11:14,791 --> 01:11:17,850
have been just a year ago. Uh,
where is the resistance though?

1241
01:11:17,851 --> 01:11:21,090
Is there any resistance to it right now
to the book? Well, not just the book,

1242
01:11:21,091 --> 01:11:25,860
but just the concept in general. 73% of
Americans believe climate change is real.

1243
01:11:26,010 --> 01:11:28,470
70% of Americans are concerned about it.

1244
01:11:28,770 --> 01:11:33,480
Those numbers are up 15% since 2015.
Who are the 27 that don't, I mean,

1245
01:11:33,481 --> 01:11:37,200
I think it's, you know, it's a hard
right wingers. Yeah, yeah. But you know,

1246
01:11:37,201 --> 01:11:38,790
those numbers are,
we live in,

1247
01:11:38,880 --> 01:11:43,880
we live in a culture now where like
most people's worldview passes through a

1248
01:11:43,921 --> 01:11:46,770
prism of partisan politics.
So like, you know,

1249
01:11:46,890 --> 01:11:50,550
there's amazing studies that show
that in the not in the early nineties,

1250
01:11:50,700 --> 01:11:53,430
there was no partisan
divide between, uh, on the,

1251
01:11:53,490 --> 01:11:57,360
on the question of whether Oj Simpson
was guilty when you controlled for race.

1252
01:11:57,990 --> 01:12:01,500
Republicans and Democrats had the
same idea about Oj Simpson's guilt.

1253
01:12:01,501 --> 01:12:02,940
That is totally unthinkable today.

1254
01:12:03,270 --> 01:12:07,470
And there's now a huge partisan split
on whether 12 years a slave deserves an

1255
01:12:07,471 --> 01:12:11,180
Oscar. Partisanship has
like totally taken over our,

1256
01:12:11,181 --> 01:12:16,181
our minds such that the fact that we
have 73% of Americans believe global

1257
01:12:16,291 --> 01:12:17,850
warming is real and happening.

1258
01:12:18,360 --> 01:12:22,170
To me that's a really fucking high number
actually, because one of the two part,

1259
01:12:22,230 --> 01:12:25,560
I don't think that the Republican
party is really anymore a denier party.

1260
01:12:25,560 --> 01:12:29,400
I think they're just a party
of skeptics and self interest.

1261
01:12:29,401 --> 01:12:31,620
They want to like look out
for business interests,

1262
01:12:31,650 --> 01:12:35,320
which actually the calculus
there's changing I could
talk about in a second. Um,

1263
01:12:36,090 --> 01:12:40,350
but people don't want to believe that
horrifying things are real because who

1264
01:12:40,351 --> 01:12:44,700
would, it's terrifying.
Um, but 73% of the country,

1265
01:12:45,270 --> 01:12:46,800
that's a lot. I mean that's, you know,

1266
01:12:47,070 --> 01:12:50,460
that's more support than there
is for just about anything. Um,

1267
01:12:50,670 --> 01:12:52,110
so I'm like basically,

1268
01:12:52,710 --> 01:12:55,290
and the speed at which that those
numbers have grown is really dramatic.

1269
01:12:55,291 --> 01:13:00,291
I said 15 points since 2015 eight
points just since March has moved up.

1270
01:13:00,690 --> 01:13:02,430
That's incredible.
Um,

1271
01:13:02,820 --> 01:13:06,180
and I do think that the economic
logic is really powerful here.

1272
01:13:06,181 --> 01:13:07,830
So it used to be the case
that there was economic,

1273
01:13:07,831 --> 01:13:12,750
conventional wisdom that action on
climate was going to be really expensive

1274
01:13:12,780 --> 01:13:13,790
because you know,

1275
01:13:13,800 --> 01:13:16,830
we're required massive upfront investment
and it would mean also foregoing

1276
01:13:16,950 --> 01:13:17,783
economic growth.

1277
01:13:18,630 --> 01:13:21,810
But all of the new research the last
couple of years reverses that logic.

1278
01:13:21,811 --> 01:13:22,201
Totally.

1279
01:13:22,201 --> 01:13:27,201
So there's a big report 2018 that said
that we could add $26 trillion to the

1280
01:13:28,141 --> 01:13:32,050
global economy through rapid
decarbonization by just 2030. Um,

1281
01:13:32,100 --> 01:13:36,390
we could avoid all of these horrible
$600 trillion impacts that we're talking

1282
01:13:36,391 --> 01:13:39,030
about if we decarbonize rapidly.

1283
01:13:39,390 --> 01:13:42,360
And there are also obviously
business opportunities there,

1284
01:13:42,361 --> 01:13:47,120
their whole solar empires to build their
whole new electric grid to build. Um,

1285
01:13:47,280 --> 01:13:51,210
so the economic conventional wisdom
has now that fast action on climate is

1286
01:13:51,211 --> 01:13:53,700
better for the economy than
slow action on climate.

1287
01:13:54,060 --> 01:13:59,060
That hasn't yet totally taken over the
perspective of our policymakers globally.

1288
01:14:00,090 --> 01:14:02,490
But I think it will soon and when it does,

1289
01:14:02,491 --> 01:14:07,140
I think that we'll see like a real sea
change in, in their um, perspective.

1290
01:14:07,141 --> 01:14:10,560
Because I think for a long time, even
people who cared about climate thought,

1291
01:14:10,740 --> 01:14:15,160
well I want to do something,
but if I have to like costs and people,

1292
01:14:15,161 --> 01:14:17,860
some jobs and costs like a
percentage point of economic growth,

1293
01:14:18,220 --> 01:14:21,160
that's not worth it.
Let me just kick the can down the road.

1294
01:14:21,400 --> 01:14:24,400
This is a slow moving phenomenon.
We'll invent our way out of it.

1295
01:14:24,401 --> 01:14:28,150
We'll grow our way out of it.
But all the new research says like,

1296
01:14:28,180 --> 01:14:31,210
let's get started right now and

1297
01:14:32,740 --> 01:14:34,060
we'll see how that plays out.
I mean,

1298
01:14:34,061 --> 01:14:38,170
if we really have to have global
emissions by 2030, it means really,

1299
01:14:38,171 --> 01:14:41,080
really aggressive action,
which I don't think is possible.

1300
01:14:41,110 --> 01:14:43,990
But I do think that we'll see much more
aggressive action in the decade ahead

1301
01:14:43,991 --> 01:14:45,710
than we've had in the decades past.

1302
01:14:45,920 --> 01:14:50,790
So you think that once there's a
financial incentive for people to, uh,

1303
01:14:50,840 --> 01:14:51,680
either,
uh,

1304
01:14:51,830 --> 01:14:55,790
some sort of an industry that reduces
carbon or something along those lines,

1305
01:14:55,791 --> 01:14:59,300
industries that are working
to mitigate global warming,

1306
01:14:59,450 --> 01:15:04,450
that once there's a financial sort of a
benefit for these people to innovate and

1307
01:15:04,491 --> 01:15:07,310
to, to move forward with this, that that's
what we're going to see. Real change.

1308
01:15:07,420 --> 01:15:11,470
Yeah. Well also that, um, I mean direct
investment of particular companies,

1309
01:15:11,471 --> 01:15:15,730
but also, you know, government
leaders who look around and say,

1310
01:15:16,330 --> 01:15:19,240
if the economic picture is going
to be better 10 years from now,

1311
01:15:19,241 --> 01:15:22,650
if we make massive investments in
green energy than it would be, and,

1312
01:15:22,651 --> 01:15:25,300
and even like pass laws,

1313
01:15:26,380 --> 01:15:31,210
regulating safety, fuel efficiency, or
even banning internal combustion engines,

1314
01:15:31,211 --> 01:15:34,000
which I think will happen
within a couple of decades. Um,

1315
01:15:35,260 --> 01:15:38,920
if that's going to be at the economic
picture taking that path as much rosier

1316
01:15:38,921 --> 01:15:40,750
than the economic picture of inaction,

1317
01:15:41,260 --> 01:15:46,030
I think they'll go down the path of
action. Right. Um, and you know, again,

1318
01:15:46,031 --> 01:15:49,540
the question is how aggressively,
how quickly, um, and in what form,

1319
01:15:49,870 --> 01:15:52,150
but I do think that,
you know,

1320
01:15:52,390 --> 01:15:56,110
I do think the incentives
will be different five years
from now than they looked

1321
01:15:56,111 --> 01:15:58,600
five years ago. And that'll
be, that'll be huge.

1322
01:15:58,870 --> 01:15:59,500
So that,

1323
01:15:59,500 --> 01:16:03,220
that you think would be a great motivator
for people to shift their perceptions

1324
01:16:03,221 --> 01:16:03,880
and uh,

1325
01:16:03,880 --> 01:16:08,740
particularly right wing folks maybe
amongst the 27% that are in denial? Yeah.

1326
01:16:09,030 --> 01:16:10,170
Well, I mean, if you
look around the world,

1327
01:16:10,171 --> 01:16:11,820
denial is not really a problem anywhere,

1328
01:16:11,821 --> 01:16:14,370
but the u s there's a
little bit of an in the UK,

1329
01:16:14,490 --> 01:16:16,200
but it's a totally American phenomenon.

1330
01:16:16,410 --> 01:16:19,590
And when you understand that the u s
is only 15% of all global emissions,

1331
01:16:19,710 --> 01:16:22,200
cause that's just typical American
arrogance, like what did, what do,

1332
01:16:22,320 --> 01:16:25,940
what do you think is the root
of that? Uh, I think it's,

1333
01:16:26,150 --> 01:16:28,980
it's basically bad behavior
by the oil companies. I mean,

1334
01:16:28,981 --> 01:16:33,480
they've like put out really
aggressive disinformation in denial.

1335
01:16:33,630 --> 01:16:37,830
You ever see the movie a
merchants of doubt? Yeah,
yeah. Perfect example of that.

1336
01:16:37,831 --> 01:16:41,430
Right? Yeah, totally. Um, yeah, and, and
I know the people who wrote the book too,

1337
01:16:41,431 --> 01:16:44,490
who are really, really
great. Um, and you know,

1338
01:16:44,491 --> 01:16:48,780
it's especially horrifying because in
the sixties and seventies that the oil

1339
01:16:48,781 --> 01:16:52,170
companies were like doing some of the
most ambitious research on climate.

1340
01:16:52,500 --> 01:16:56,160
So there, you know, then they ended
up suppressing that going forward.

1341
01:16:56,161 --> 01:17:01,161
But they knew shit about how the planet
was going to change before any of the

1342
01:17:02,191 --> 01:17:04,230
rest of us. Really. Um,

1343
01:17:05,230 --> 01:17:09,170
no alternatives back then. And there was
no real emission standards like this.

1344
01:17:09,340 --> 01:17:10,280
That's when catalytic

1345
01:17:10,280 --> 01:17:13,760
converters started being inactive.
Yeah, well you know, somewhere on them,

1346
01:17:13,850 --> 01:17:17,330
if we had started decarbonization in 2000,

1347
01:17:17,930 --> 01:17:21,080
which just coincidentally was the year
that Al Gore won the popular vote for

1348
01:17:21,081 --> 01:17:22,520
president,
um,

1349
01:17:22,910 --> 01:17:26,540
we would have had to globally
cut emissions by about
3% per year to get below

1350
01:17:26,541 --> 01:17:27,374
two degrees.

1351
01:17:27,650 --> 01:17:31,250
We're now at a spot where we have to
cut them by about 10% per year and if we

1352
01:17:31,251 --> 01:17:33,890
wait another decade, we're going to
have to cut them by 30% per year,

1353
01:17:33,891 --> 01:17:35,840
which is like an unthinkable rate.

1354
01:17:35,841 --> 01:17:40,400
So we wouldn't have had to
take such aggressive action.
If we had started early,

1355
01:17:40,550 --> 01:17:45,550
we would have had to just be doing
moderate kind of on the margins changes.

1356
01:17:46,700 --> 01:17:49,490
But we're now in a situation where
the problem is way too big for that.

1357
01:17:49,880 --> 01:17:53,210
And there are people who want to talk
about the solutions that could have been

1358
01:17:53,211 --> 01:17:54,350
useful 20 years ago.

1359
01:17:54,380 --> 01:17:57,980
Now I'm talking about the carbon tax
is like one quite popular thing to talk

1360
01:17:57,981 --> 01:18:02,240
about. Um, the UN says that in
order to be effective, the carbon,

1361
01:18:02,270 --> 01:18:07,070
a global carbon tax would need to
be perhaps as high as $5,500 a ton.

1362
01:18:07,430 --> 01:18:08,630
And there's nowhere else in the world.

1363
01:18:08,631 --> 01:18:12,260
There's nowhere in the world where there's
a tax that's even one 100th as high

1364
01:18:12,261 --> 01:18:14,030
as that right now.
Um,

1365
01:18:14,120 --> 01:18:15,890
and the places in the world
where they do have carbon taxes,

1366
01:18:15,891 --> 01:18:18,380
everybody's admissions, there's
still grew up going up. So there,

1367
01:18:18,470 --> 01:18:21,380
there was a time when like the kind of
like you don't have to change anything.

1368
01:18:21,381 --> 01:18:24,770
We'll just like fiddle on the margins
here could have worked if we had taken,

1369
01:18:24,800 --> 01:18:28,580
if we had really been focused on it.
But we're sort of past that point now,

1370
01:18:28,940 --> 01:18:32,870
unfortunately. Um, but it's interesting
you the talking about the oil companies,

1371
01:18:32,930 --> 01:18:36,650
um, I think they, you know, I think
they're responsible for denial,

1372
01:18:36,651 --> 01:18:40,520
but I also think that denial is not all
that important in American politics. Um,

1373
01:18:40,700 --> 01:18:43,250
because when you look around the world,
you see many countries,

1374
01:18:43,251 --> 01:18:44,900
which v with very different politics,

1375
01:18:45,200 --> 01:18:49,100
even quite universally
focused on climate issues,

1376
01:18:49,220 --> 01:18:52,220
who are not behaving any better.
When it comes to carbon than we are.

1377
01:18:52,580 --> 01:18:54,350
And so you think,
well what is the sickness here?

1378
01:18:54,530 --> 01:18:57,890
Is that the Republican Party and their
climate denial or is it the fact that all

1379
01:18:57,891 --> 01:19:00,950
of us, Jen just want,
you know, more better,

1380
01:19:00,951 --> 01:19:05,951
cheaper stuff and we have a really hard
time conceiving of different paths that

1381
01:19:06,471 --> 01:19:11,040
don't push us forward towards
more consumption and you know,

1382
01:19:11,060 --> 01:19:11,893
more um,

1383
01:19:12,710 --> 01:19:15,920
more than modern amenities that we sort
of assume we'll keep accumulating over

1384
01:19:15,921 --> 01:19:19,100
time. I mean, people say financial
capitalism is the problem.

1385
01:19:19,220 --> 01:19:21,590
I have some sympathy for that view,
but I also look around the world.

1386
01:19:21,591 --> 01:19:24,350
I see social democracies who are behaving
really poorly when it comes to carbon.

1387
01:19:24,650 --> 01:19:27,410
I see socialist countries who are behaving
really poorly when it comes to carbon.

1388
01:19:27,950 --> 01:19:32,600
Um, it seems on some level like it's even
deeper than the systems that we have to

1389
01:19:32,601 --> 01:19:36,260
organize and manage our
cultural priorities.

1390
01:19:36,650 --> 01:19:41,060
And there are now, you know, getting back
to the villa, any of the oil companies,

1391
01:19:41,440 --> 01:19:44,330
they're now all these lawsuits that are
being brought against them for basically

1392
01:19:44,331 --> 01:19:48,410
on the model of the, of the cigarette
company is like that for climate damages.

1393
01:19:48,860 --> 01:19:53,050
And um, that may be,
they may be victorious.

1394
01:19:53,060 --> 01:19:55,140
They may put some of these
companies out of business. Um,

1395
01:19:55,220 --> 01:19:57,350
I think it's not that likely,
but it's possible.

1396
01:19:57,800 --> 01:20:00,020
There are also other lawsuits that are
happening that are really interesting.

1397
01:20:00,021 --> 01:20:04,940
There's one in the Netherlands
that some people held, um,

1398
01:20:05,480 --> 01:20:07,360
the Dutch government,
they basically,

1399
01:20:07,361 --> 01:20:11,010
the Dutch government was not honoring
the Paris accords and citizens sued to

1400
01:20:11,011 --> 01:20:13,230
hold them to that and we won the case.

1401
01:20:13,231 --> 01:20:16,590
So the Dutch government is now obligated
legally to do better on climate than

1402
01:20:16,591 --> 01:20:17,460
they were doing on their own.

1403
01:20:17,850 --> 01:20:22,200
And in the u s there's this amazing court
case called Juliana versus the United

1404
01:20:22,200 --> 01:20:22,201
States,

1405
01:20:22,201 --> 01:20:27,201
which is a lawsuit being brought by
kids using this kind of ingenious use of

1406
01:20:28,570 --> 01:20:29,790
equal protection clause.

1407
01:20:29,910 --> 01:20:34,910
They're arguing that their generation
has been exposed to climate damages,

1408
01:20:35,700 --> 01:20:39,510
that there, the previous generation, our
parents generation were protected from.

1409
01:20:39,810 --> 01:20:44,400
And so they're saying this climate policy
is a violation of the equal protection

1410
01:20:44,401 --> 01:20:44,850
clause.

1411
01:20:44,850 --> 01:20:48,480
You're not protecting us in the same way
that you protected our parents that's

1412
01:20:48,481 --> 01:20:51,510
at the district court and Argen, which is
just one level below the supreme court.

1413
01:20:51,511 --> 01:20:54,570
I think it will win in the District
Court almost certainly won't win at the

1414
01:20:54,570 --> 01:20:56,220
Supreme Court.
But if it did one of the Supreme Court,

1415
01:20:56,820 --> 01:21:01,820
it would immediately obligate the u s
to a totally maximalist climate policy

1416
01:21:03,390 --> 01:21:07,380
because it's literally impossible to
protect the next generation from climate

1417
01:21:07,381 --> 01:21:09,720
damages as fully as the
previous generation was.

1418
01:21:09,930 --> 01:21:12,240
But they'd be obligated to
do everything they could,

1419
01:21:12,360 --> 01:21:15,140
which would mean sort of
suddenly something like the um,

1420
01:21:15,840 --> 01:21:18,480
the World War II scale
mobilization that the UN calls for,

1421
01:21:18,481 --> 01:21:20,550
which would be really kind
of dramatic and incredible.

1422
01:21:21,060 --> 01:21:24,660
And I think that's one path
forward is through a litigation,

1423
01:21:24,690 --> 01:21:29,340
because so many places in the world,
it's not just politics are a nerd,

1424
01:21:29,370 --> 01:21:30,840
like American politics are a nerd.

1425
01:21:31,200 --> 01:21:36,200
It's just there's a lot of slow moving
bureaucracy and slow moving public

1426
01:21:36,211 --> 01:21:36,660
opinion.

1427
01:21:36,660 --> 01:21:40,140
And in the same way that a lot of civil
rights victories were fought and won in

1428
01:21:40,141 --> 01:21:40,561
the courts.

1429
01:21:40,561 --> 01:21:44,370
I think we might be able to make some
progress in the courts on climate too.

1430
01:21:44,520 --> 01:21:47,100
We'll see if you had a magic wand.

1431
01:21:47,440 --> 01:21:51,180
But if they made you the king
of the world and they said you,

1432
01:21:51,181 --> 01:21:55,170
you can decide what we do, what would
you, what would the first step be?

1433
01:21:55,380 --> 01:21:57,930
The first step is just ending
fossil fuel subsidies. I mean,

1434
01:21:57,931 --> 01:22:00,600
there's no reason why these companies
should be receiving public money.

1435
01:22:00,620 --> 01:22:04,580
And why are the just
incumbency advantages? They're
well connected companies,

1436
01:22:04,590 --> 01:22:09,420
a lot of them are really big and powerful
and any government in the world is not

1437
01:22:09,421 --> 01:22:13,440
going to want a major industry
to like completely collapse. Um,

1438
01:22:14,160 --> 01:22:17,760
but you know, if we're really
subsidizing them $5 trillion a year,

1439
01:22:18,300 --> 01:22:20,940
that's a ton of money that
can be poured into green,

1440
01:22:21,210 --> 01:22:24,090
like to r and D of New Technology.

1441
01:22:24,420 --> 01:22:26,790
It can be poured into the carbon
capture like we talked about before.

1442
01:22:26,791 --> 01:22:28,620
That's just an unbelievable resource.

1443
01:22:28,621 --> 01:22:33,000
And it would accelerate the decline
of coal in particular. And uh,

1444
01:22:33,090 --> 01:22:37,410
and other oil. And other fossil fuel,
uh, businesses, which will be great.

1445
01:22:37,620 --> 01:22:41,420
Is there any discussion about that in
individual countries? Yeah, but, um,

1446
01:22:41,480 --> 01:22:45,010
it's slow moving. Um, you
know, there's stuff about, um,

1447
01:22:45,630 --> 01:22:47,970
people are taking action in all
different ways at all different levels,

1448
01:22:47,971 --> 01:22:49,620
which I think is basically necessary.

1449
01:22:49,621 --> 01:22:54,210
So their cities in Europe where cars
are now being banned, um, cars, yeah.

1450
01:22:54,700 --> 01:22:58,140
In the city. Yeah. It
just like riding around.

1451
01:22:59,150 --> 01:23:02,160
You've been living in la too long. You
can do that in Amsterdam. You can do that.

1452
01:23:03,330 --> 01:23:05,980
It just seems ridiculous.
Yeah.

1453
01:23:06,180 --> 01:23:08,590
Well, I mean, I think, um,
maybe, maybe it'll just be,

1454
01:23:08,620 --> 01:23:12,430
you can only have an electric car,
um, you know, maybe 10 years from now,

1455
01:23:12,650 --> 01:23:15,970
like it'll be illegal in the u s
to build, uh, like, uh, you know,

1456
01:23:16,000 --> 01:23:17,350
a gas guzzling car.

1457
01:23:17,380 --> 01:23:21,730
I got an electric car recently and it's
amazing the blow back from my friends.

1458
01:23:22,270 --> 01:23:27,070
What are they saying? Well, first
of all, it's always homophobic or,

1459
01:23:27,071 --> 01:23:28,930
or a or a feminine.

1460
01:23:29,260 --> 01:23:33,340
They're always going after you about
your estrogen levels and your manhood.

1461
01:23:33,341 --> 01:23:37,180
It's like, it's weird. It's kind of like
a space. I mean Tesla's are kind of like,

1462
01:23:37,181 --> 01:23:39,420
there's kind of like space ships
though. They feel, I mean there's,

1463
01:23:39,421 --> 01:23:42,340
what have you been in one? Yeah, he
driven one. I haven't driven one.

1464
01:23:42,341 --> 01:23:43,930
I've been in one,
I've,

1465
01:23:44,080 --> 01:23:48,070
I drove in one years ago
and I wasn't that impressed.

1466
01:23:48,250 --> 01:23:50,740
I want to say like maybe
five or six years ago,

1467
01:23:50,980 --> 01:23:55,210
but now I have one of the new ones that's
crazy fast. It doesn't even make sense.

1468
01:23:55,750 --> 01:23:59,560
Regular cars are stupid. They're stupid
and you spend all that money on gas,

1469
01:23:59,561 --> 01:24:01,900
why would you want to do that?
But I mean they're stupid.

1470
01:24:01,970 --> 01:24:03,430
Like they don't work as good.

1471
01:24:03,460 --> 01:24:06,410
Like that thing is way better than
any car I've ever driven. Yeah.

1472
01:24:06,580 --> 01:24:08,020
And it's only going to get better there.

1473
01:24:08,021 --> 01:24:11,590
They don't even make sense how fast they
are and they drive themselves. Yeah.

1474
01:24:11,680 --> 01:24:15,040
Like you hit this little thing go do,
do and it just fucking steers.

1475
01:24:15,520 --> 01:24:18,680
It takes over. Yeah. Like
it drives, yeah. And it's,

1476
01:24:18,700 --> 01:24:22,120
it stays within the speed limit and you
could just kind of half ass space out.

1477
01:24:22,390 --> 01:24:24,880
Cause keep your hand on the
steering wheel and it a,

1478
01:24:24,881 --> 01:24:27,920
it breaks when there's cars in front
of you and slow. It's very strange.

1479
01:24:27,921 --> 01:24:32,650
It will even change lanes for you.
Amazing. It's fucked. It's weird.

1480
01:24:32,770 --> 01:24:36,610
It's weird. It's, it's very difficult
to let go and to give in like that.

1481
01:24:36,790 --> 01:24:41,010
But the strange thing that I felt was the,

1482
01:24:41,011 --> 01:24:45,010
the blowback from my friends like,
and they're joking around.

1483
01:24:45,011 --> 01:24:48,280
Obviously most of my friends are
comedians, but it's a, it's hilarious.

1484
01:24:48,310 --> 01:24:50,180
Even people have heckled me about it.
Yeah.

1485
01:24:50,380 --> 01:24:53,230
Well I feel that like just
at the aesthetic level,

1486
01:24:53,530 --> 01:24:56,140
I understand that mocking
of like the Prius,

1487
01:24:56,350 --> 01:24:58,680
but I feel like the Tesla is actually,
it looks like a macho.

1488
01:24:59,200 --> 01:25:03,100
The piece is a piece of shit.
It's like a cheese wedge with wheels.

1489
01:25:03,610 --> 01:25:05,320
But I mean it's like, you know, uh, yeah,

1490
01:25:05,321 --> 01:25:08,950
we live in a sick culture where
like being healthy and responsible.

1491
01:25:10,230 --> 01:25:14,080
It was like cigarettes and whiskey
in mock. Someone eating a salad.

1492
01:25:15,640 --> 01:25:20,620
It's very weird. It is very weird. But
um, I was a, that is an American problem.

1493
01:25:20,621 --> 01:25:23,450
Like other parts in the world, they're
not as attached to their trucks. And Shit.

1494
01:25:23,510 --> 01:25:27,210
Grouse were gross, but, but there's, um,

1495
01:25:27,250 --> 01:25:31,690
something particularly strange about
being on that side of it cause I was, um,

1496
01:25:32,710 --> 01:25:35,920
I wanna I don't wanna say I was
pessimistic about electric cars,

1497
01:25:36,250 --> 01:25:40,030
but when Elan did the podcast, I told
my by one of his cars, because he was,

1498
01:25:40,060 --> 01:25:42,490
he was telling me how great
they are. I'm like, yeah, yeah,

1499
01:25:42,491 --> 01:25:43,420
I'm probably one of your cars.

1500
01:25:43,600 --> 01:25:48,430
But I really did not expect to like it
as much as I do. And then once I got it,

1501
01:25:48,431 --> 01:25:50,820
I was like, oh, okay, now I get it. Yeah.

1502
01:25:50,860 --> 01:25:54,340
But then I was thinking about my own
resistance to it because I like cars.

1503
01:25:54,341 --> 01:25:58,780
I have no muscle cars. I have a
couple, I have an older Porsche.

1504
01:25:58,781 --> 01:26:03,620
I love them. They're fun. I like those
kind of cars, but they're stupid.

1505
01:26:03,980 --> 01:26:04,970
They really are dumb.

1506
01:26:04,971 --> 01:26:08,580
That's a dumb way to get
around the Tesla's a way
better way to get around. Yeah.

1507
01:26:08,870 --> 01:26:09,910
And you know,

1508
01:26:09,920 --> 01:26:14,810
he's got one that's coming out in 2020
that's going to have a 660 mile range,

1509
01:26:15,560 --> 01:26:18,470
which is in San mean you drive all the
way to San Francisco and back with one

1510
01:26:18,471 --> 01:26:22,630
charge. You know, I mean he's incredible.
I think, you know, I like there,

1511
01:26:22,670 --> 01:26:24,380
there are reasons why he
gets the shit that he gets.

1512
01:26:24,381 --> 01:26:29,381
But I also think like Tesla and solar
city are incredibly important and I'm

1513
01:26:30,141 --> 01:26:30,531
actually,

1514
01:26:30,531 --> 01:26:33,830
I don't understand why there aren't
more people in Silicon Valley who are

1515
01:26:34,040 --> 01:26:35,330
focused on climate in this way.

1516
01:26:35,331 --> 01:26:40,250
Like obviously they want like these are
people who see themselves as gods who

1517
01:26:40,251 --> 01:26:43,940
want to be a world historical figures
there. They're literally do that.

1518
01:26:44,180 --> 01:26:45,950
Who Do you think is doing that well?
Like,

1519
01:26:46,070 --> 01:26:50,540
like Jeff as you think he thinks of
himself as a god. Yeah. Really? Yeah,

1520
01:26:50,720 --> 01:26:54,500
really. You know, and now I read those
text messages he sent to that check.

1521
01:26:55,520 --> 01:26:57,980
I don't think God would
say that God would say,

1522
01:26:57,981 --> 01:27:01,980
you should be lucky to get this dick.
All this space exploration stuff though.

1523
01:27:01,981 --> 01:27:02,571
It's like,
you know,

1524
01:27:02,571 --> 01:27:06,680
all that people are obsessed with the end
of the life extinction extinction. Um,

1525
01:27:06,980 --> 01:27:10,920
but, but does he think that this is
a side effect of having $150 billion,

1526
01:27:10,940 --> 01:27:12,660
but you can do so much good with that.
Yes.

1527
01:27:12,680 --> 01:27:15,620
So basis is pouring $1
billion a year into his,

1528
01:27:15,770 --> 01:27:19,430
into his space exploration
project, which is like, I mean,

1529
01:27:19,670 --> 01:27:22,040
I'm excited by space too.
I think it'd be cool to go up there,

1530
01:27:22,041 --> 01:27:25,600
but there's some pressing problems here
which we could really benefit, you know,

1531
01:27:25,610 --> 01:27:27,620
that money could really
benefit and I agree.

1532
01:27:27,621 --> 01:27:31,340
But longterm I think the philosophy is
that we're going to have to get off this

1533
01:27:31,341 --> 01:27:36,341
planet if the human race is going to
succeed because of not just the threat of

1534
01:27:36,861 --> 01:27:41,660
global warming but of Astra steroid packs
and yeah, man, it's an asteroid thing.

1535
01:27:41,660 --> 01:27:42,020
I think.

1536
01:27:42,020 --> 01:27:47,020
I mean for me Novas there's a lot of
factors mark on the particular question of

1537
01:27:47,571 --> 01:27:48,760
climate.
Um,

1538
01:27:49,250 --> 01:27:52,340
there's just no way that the earth is
going to get as inhospitable as Mars is.

1539
01:27:52,520 --> 01:27:57,520
So the idea of building a colony there
as a hedge against global warming is just

1540
01:27:57,860 --> 01:28:02,270
crazy. We could, it is ridiculous
on a good, on the positive note,

1541
01:28:02,330 --> 01:28:06,440
if we could fix that shit
hole, like imagine what we
could do here. Yeah. Paradise.

1542
01:28:06,441 --> 01:28:08,420
Yeah. Well the idea is
terraforming, right?

1543
01:28:08,421 --> 01:28:11,300
That they can go there with some kind of
massive machine that's going to create

1544
01:28:11,301 --> 01:28:13,520
oxygen and the environment and yeah.

1545
01:28:13,521 --> 01:28:15,860
Well that's a good place to
practice because no one lives there.

1546
01:28:16,010 --> 01:28:19,940
So he could do all kinds of goofy shit
and go, well, good news and bad news.

1547
01:28:20,240 --> 01:28:22,340
The good news is we figured out a way,
terraform,

1548
01:28:22,370 --> 01:28:25,220
the bad news is we already fucked up Mars,
so we're going to try another spot.

1549
01:28:25,220 --> 01:28:28,460
We're going to go to, you know, we're
going to move on to, yeah, yeah. Well,

1550
01:28:28,461 --> 01:28:30,610
you know Venus used to be
actually quite earthlight. Yeah.

1551
01:28:30,630 --> 01:28:34,190
They went through a really rapid
global warming that made it,

1552
01:28:34,191 --> 01:28:37,580
now it's like a total hellhole. Right?
And that's like the sort of worst case.

1553
01:28:38,360 --> 01:28:40,550
Worst case for earth is
the venous scenario. Well,

1554
01:28:40,551 --> 01:28:42,680
ultimately the sun's going to burn out.
Right.

1555
01:28:42,990 --> 01:28:45,020
But that's many millions
of years for sure.

1556
01:28:45,050 --> 01:28:49,370
But if we really do look into the future,
something, something has to be done.

1557
01:28:49,400 --> 01:28:53,680
You know what I mean? This is a, the,
the grandest of grand scales. The,

1558
01:28:53,681 --> 01:28:57,710
the concept of a, some sort
of interstellar arcs. I
mean, I believe that I'm,

1559
01:28:57,711 --> 01:29:02,160
and I'm, I'm, I'm with it. I just think
the timescale, the threat that we're,

1560
01:29:02,250 --> 01:29:07,200
that we need to avert by
space exploration. That's
a timescale of Millennia.

1561
01:29:07,260 --> 01:29:11,310
Yes. We have a lot of new
technology develop over the
next thousand years that'll

1562
01:29:11,340 --> 01:29:13,800
allow us to do a better and more
efficiently. But climate change,

1563
01:29:13,820 --> 01:29:15,830
the timescale is like the next 30 years.
Right?

1564
01:29:15,960 --> 01:29:19,680
So we need to focus on it now to give
ourselves the opportunity to do the other

1565
01:29:19,681 --> 01:29:22,740
show. Why do you think it's sexier
to go to space? Is that what it is?

1566
01:29:22,741 --> 01:29:27,210
Like rockets and I mean, I think
for these dudes, yeah. Yeah.

1567
01:29:27,240 --> 01:29:30,360
It's a big metal deck sheeting off in
the atmosphere. That's what we're doing.

1568
01:29:30,430 --> 01:29:34,970
Trying to fuck space. I actually
made that argument about Mars. Yeah.

1569
01:29:35,010 --> 01:29:39,240
It's like they're shaped like dicks.
Yeah. Something to that. Yeah.

1570
01:29:39,750 --> 01:29:42,570
Well also this generation of
people really grew up in the,

1571
01:29:42,600 --> 01:29:46,620
in the age of like the, the
space race. I mean it's um,

1572
01:29:46,920 --> 01:29:48,810
and the aftermath of landing on the moon.

1573
01:29:48,810 --> 01:29:51,000
And I think there is like
Peter Teal talks about this,

1574
01:29:51,001 --> 01:29:54,510
there's this kind of unfulfilled
sense of future that we all,

1575
01:29:54,511 --> 01:29:58,980
like anybody who grew up in the post war
years in 67, they were like, you know,

1576
01:29:58,981 --> 01:30:02,220
whatever his famous line were promised
flying cars and all we got was 140

1577
01:30:02,221 --> 01:30:05,400
characters or whatever. I think that
applies to the space exploration stuff.

1578
01:30:05,401 --> 01:30:06,060
It's like,

1579
01:30:06,060 --> 01:30:10,530
well the government is no longer doing
the really ambitious shit but we can do

1580
01:30:10,531 --> 01:30:11,850
it privately.
On the other hand,

1581
01:30:12,030 --> 01:30:15,000
there is a government in the world
that is doing that shit. And China,

1582
01:30:15,540 --> 01:30:17,910
they just landed on the
far side of the moon.

1583
01:30:18,090 --> 01:30:22,470
They're doing really aggressive space
exploration and I haven't been there in 20

1584
01:30:22,471 --> 01:30:22,681
years,

1585
01:30:22,681 --> 01:30:27,210
but the people I know who live there
say there is so much faith in the future

1586
01:30:27,211 --> 01:30:31,350
there. Um, they just
believe in a very inherent,

1587
01:30:31,500 --> 01:30:33,780
deep down way that like
the future will be better.

1588
01:30:33,780 --> 01:30:36,120
And Saifai e in an exciting way.

1589
01:30:36,720 --> 01:30:39,390
And that's so far from the way that
Americans think about the future.

1590
01:30:39,900 --> 01:30:42,960
Is that part of the benefit of
having a dictator run things?

1591
01:30:43,380 --> 01:30:45,390
I think it's just like
they're on a huge upswing.

1592
01:30:45,930 --> 01:30:50,850
Like there's no debate about how
things get done. Yeah, totally.

1593
01:30:51,300 --> 01:30:53,130
I mean that's what I was saying before.
It's like it,

1594
01:30:53,131 --> 01:30:55,790
it gives you some hope for climate.
If like Xi Jinping is just like, okay,

1595
01:30:55,800 --> 01:30:58,710
immediately, no more
coal, they'll all stop.

1596
01:30:59,670 --> 01:31:04,310
But he's also throwing 2 million Muslims
and concentration camps. Right? Yeah. Um,

1597
01:31:04,590 --> 01:31:06,150
this bayzos thing,
I mean,

1598
01:31:06,151 --> 01:31:09,150
I'm not criticizing you because I
think it's a very common thought,

1599
01:31:09,180 --> 01:31:12,690
but why is it that we will look at
these super rich billion billionaire

1600
01:31:12,691 --> 01:31:14,430
characters that are on
the top of the heap?

1601
01:31:14,760 --> 01:31:18,180
Why do we think of them as like having
these tremendous egos and looking like

1602
01:31:18,181 --> 01:31:21,150
gods? Isn't it sort of just, just,

1603
01:31:21,151 --> 01:31:25,350
just how you're always going to look
at someone who lives in of $100 million

1604
01:31:25,351 --> 01:31:30,000
house and it's possible, I
think when you look at, I mean,

1605
01:31:30,001 --> 01:31:32,310
not to get too like armchair
psychologizing but basis,

1606
01:31:32,311 --> 01:31:34,950
but when you look at the
physical transformation that
he's put himself through,

1607
01:31:35,370 --> 01:31:38,100
when you think about like
the life extinction, what
has he done physically? Well,

1608
01:31:38,101 --> 01:31:39,350
he's just like,
I mean if,

1609
01:31:39,510 --> 01:31:41,700
if you look at photos of him
when he's like a young man,

1610
01:31:41,720 --> 01:31:46,590
he's just kind of like dweeby. Right?
And now he's like a, um, an action hero.

1611
01:31:46,730 --> 01:31:50,850
Is He really? Yeah. I mean maybe not
like you, but he's like, he's, yeah,

1612
01:31:50,851 --> 01:31:53,880
he's pretty as big as Jack.
Am I missing something?

1613
01:31:53,920 --> 01:31:57,390
Let me show you how it looks different.
Go pull up,

1614
01:31:57,391 --> 01:32:00,280
pull up some images of Jeff jacked.

1615
01:32:01,000 --> 01:32:05,620
I didn't know he got
a trainer. I mean, no,

1616
01:32:05,621 --> 01:32:07,630
I'm not blaming him,
but that's only one part of it.

1617
01:32:07,631 --> 01:32:12,040
I would say I'm bigger than that is, you
know, the, I had just had thin skins,

1618
01:32:12,290 --> 01:32:14,580
the worlds, okay. Let me say zoom in

1619
01:32:16,210 --> 01:32:20,860
or else I guess he's got
some arms there is, oh wow.

1620
01:32:20,890 --> 01:32:24,850
That's a big difference. Yeah.
But he's also got a vest on.

1621
01:32:24,851 --> 01:32:28,120
I guess his arms do look pretty big.
Yeah.

1622
01:32:28,180 --> 01:32:31,200
I mean in most ways I'm
not a business hater.

1623
01:32:31,240 --> 01:32:34,920
I think Amazon has been actually really
pretty great. I'm a fan. Yeah. I like,

1624
01:32:34,930 --> 01:32:38,680
well listen to the guy talk and I loved
his letter to the national enquirer.

1625
01:32:38,710 --> 01:32:40,270
There he is right there.
Yeah.

1626
01:32:40,271 --> 01:32:44,610
So he looks fit in front of the King
Kong rampage movie. Is that him? Yeah.

1627
01:32:45,270 --> 01:32:49,210
Yeah, he looks pretty good. Um, okay.

1628
01:32:49,360 --> 01:32:52,450
I guess physical transformation, but
that's, yeah, probably the life extension,

1629
01:32:52,451 --> 01:32:55,870
like uploading your brain to the computer.
There's so many busy into that shit. I,

1630
01:32:55,871 --> 01:32:58,450
he is actually, I think not as
into it as some other people,

1631
01:32:58,451 --> 01:33:01,700
but how does so psi Phi, you know, I, um,

1632
01:33:02,020 --> 01:33:05,710
I interviewed Kurzweil a while back when
I was doing the Scifi show when I went

1633
01:33:05,711 --> 01:33:10,630
to this, uh, 2045 conference that
they had in Manhattan and it was, um,

1634
01:33:11,290 --> 01:33:12,100
these guys are,

1635
01:33:12,100 --> 01:33:15,520
they're talking about something that
they think will be invented and they're

1636
01:33:15,521 --> 01:33:18,670
acting as if it's been invented
inevitable. Yeah, yeah, totally. I mean,

1637
01:33:18,671 --> 01:33:20,860
Eric Schmidt has said
about climate change,

1638
01:33:21,370 --> 01:33:25,810
that the solution is already here in
the sense that AI will just solve it.

1639
01:33:26,560 --> 01:33:29,240
And it's like that. Well, no, no, sorry.

1640
01:33:30,310 --> 01:33:34,030
That's a weird thing that we do though,
right? We, we always looked like, oh,

1641
01:33:34,031 --> 01:33:36,460
someone's going to handle
this. Yeah. Well, the, the, um,

1642
01:33:36,461 --> 01:33:39,280
the brain upload stuff is interesting
to me with regard to climate,

1643
01:33:39,281 --> 01:33:40,680
just because it's like a,

1644
01:33:40,750 --> 01:33:45,750
a portal through which we can
escape environmental degradation.

1645
01:33:46,300 --> 01:33:49,120
So if the world is on fire
and full of suffering,

1646
01:33:49,760 --> 01:33:52,840
maybe we can just upload our
minds to some machines and not,

1647
01:33:52,870 --> 01:33:54,850
not live in the real world anymore.

1648
01:33:55,330 --> 01:33:59,020
And when I think about
even my relationship to my
phone, like tech addiction,

1649
01:33:59,021 --> 01:34:03,760
generally we're sort of being taught
to think of the world on our screens as

1650
01:34:03,761 --> 01:34:06,100
more real than the world that's around us.

1651
01:34:06,430 --> 01:34:10,210
And that sounds in a lot of ways
like decline, nest and whatever.

1652
01:34:10,211 --> 01:34:15,010
But I also think it may be a kind of
coping mechanism for a world that we're

1653
01:34:15,011 --> 01:34:17,320
about to head into where there is
that much more suffering. And when I,

1654
01:34:17,440 --> 01:34:20,440
when I see for instance,
like the whole wellness movement,

1655
01:34:20,770 --> 01:34:21,730
I think their intuitions,

1656
01:34:21,731 --> 01:34:24,670
they are about like the toxicity of
the world and how we have to avoid it.

1657
01:34:25,150 --> 01:34:30,150
I think the way that it will reshape our
own sense of self and relationship to

1658
01:34:31,661 --> 01:34:34,870
the world and idea of our
place in nature and history.

1659
01:34:35,050 --> 01:34:39,170
All of these things are
really, um, up in the air, um,

1660
01:34:39,280 --> 01:34:41,950
and will be affected by climate
change I think in, you know,

1661
01:34:41,980 --> 01:34:46,670
in ways that we don't yet
appreciate or understand. So the,

1662
01:34:46,690 --> 01:34:50,140
to wave the wand. Yeah. What
would be step number one?

1663
01:34:50,440 --> 01:34:54,120
Step number one is ending fossil fuel
subsidies and fossil fuel subsidies.

1664
01:34:54,121 --> 01:34:58,010
Step number two,
step number two,

1665
01:34:58,760 --> 01:35:01,400
just massive R and d investment.

1666
01:35:01,470 --> 01:35:04,040
My massive investment in r
and D and New infrastructure,

1667
01:35:04,070 --> 01:35:06,020
which would be great for
the economy. Right? Totally.

1668
01:35:06,470 --> 01:35:11,390
So all these things taking a positive
or taking a negative and looking at

1669
01:35:11,391 --> 01:35:16,220
positive aspects of mitigating
the problem. Yeah. And Yeah,

1670
01:35:16,221 --> 01:35:18,840
new energy sources. I mean
they're, there really are,

1671
01:35:18,890 --> 01:35:23,150
there are already new business empires
that were, are from the climate change.

1672
01:35:23,151 --> 01:35:25,550
Are there new solar empires
that are new wind empires,

1673
01:35:26,750 --> 01:35:30,230
but that can happen globally.
That needs to happen globally. Um,

1674
01:35:30,650 --> 01:35:34,820
and you know, that's, you know, then we
have to, we have to deal with agriculture,

1675
01:35:35,840 --> 01:35:39,140
which may be about seaweed and maybe about
lab grown meat. I don't know. But um,

1676
01:35:39,410 --> 01:35:42,680
you know, it's, it's like the big picture.

1677
01:35:43,580 --> 01:35:47,270
It's all carbon. It's all just how
much carbon we put into the atmosphere.

1678
01:35:47,630 --> 01:35:51,050
So I think it will come to be the
case that in the decades ahead,

1679
01:35:51,800 --> 01:35:56,800
everything about the way that we interact
with the world will be described and

1680
01:35:57,711 --> 01:36:00,710
understood in terms of carbon.
So that for instance,

1681
01:36:01,190 --> 01:36:04,310
your walked down the aisle in the
supermarket, you see organic food,

1682
01:36:04,760 --> 01:36:08,030
you see non GMO food,
you'll also see like carbon free food.

1683
01:36:08,350 --> 01:36:10,160
And that'll be a big part
of the way that we eat,

1684
01:36:10,490 --> 01:36:14,570
consume everything that things will be
advertised that way, promoted that way.

1685
01:36:14,930 --> 01:36:19,460
But globally we just need to
really focus on reducing carbon.

1686
01:36:19,750 --> 01:36:22,940
Is it like, and wherever it
is, which is almost everywhere.

1687
01:36:23,150 --> 01:36:27,250
We need to figure out new ways to do
whatever it is we're doing. And that's um,

1688
01:36:27,290 --> 01:36:30,890
that's causing that problem. We need to
make it trendy in La. That's what we do.

1689
01:36:30,891 --> 01:36:33,350
Have some organic gluten
free carbon free food.

1690
01:36:33,440 --> 01:36:36,370
I feel like that's already
kind of happening. Should
be. Yeah, that would be it.

1691
01:36:36,440 --> 01:36:41,060
As long as that kicks in and people
realize there's some street cred to be in

1692
01:36:41,061 --> 01:36:44,330
carbon free. Yeah. I mean, I think
in different parts of the world,

1693
01:36:44,331 --> 01:36:47,720
people will relate differently
to it. So like, yeah,

1694
01:36:47,721 --> 01:36:52,721
in China there's scheduled to have this
huge boom in beef consumption and dairy

1695
01:36:53,541 --> 01:36:58,541
consumption because it's expected
that as that country gets richer,

1696
01:36:59,390 --> 01:37:01,790
the people will adopt a more western diet.

1697
01:37:02,720 --> 01:37:06,890
But it's also possible
that they want that.

1698
01:37:06,891 --> 01:37:11,480
Like the new Chinese middle class
will be still really interested in,

1699
01:37:11,540 --> 01:37:16,450
you know, Tofu, less interested in
beef, less interested in milk. They are,

1700
01:37:16,700 --> 01:37:20,510
you know, um, and it might be,

1701
01:37:20,630 --> 01:37:25,190
it might be easier to have them follow
that path and it will be to make the

1702
01:37:25,191 --> 01:37:30,110
American average American
eat less beef. But, um,

1703
01:37:31,280 --> 01:37:34,550
you know, it's, it's everywhere. It's
like everywhere you look, there's some,

1704
01:37:34,580 --> 01:37:38,810
there's some, some little problem to
solve. Um, but then when you pull back,

1705
01:37:38,811 --> 01:37:41,090
it really is just carbon.
It's like absolutely everything.

1706
01:37:41,270 --> 01:37:44,540
If you think about everything you do
in terms of the carbon impact it has,

1707
01:37:45,470 --> 01:37:49,460
then you know, the solution.
So suggest themselves.

1708
01:37:49,640 --> 01:37:52,360
And I do think that in the coming decades,
if,

1709
01:37:52,430 --> 01:37:56,020
even if you and I don't start to
think in those terms are as well,

1710
01:37:56,021 --> 01:37:57,650
that like everything will be,
oh,

1711
01:37:57,651 --> 01:38:00,660
we're entering into a new
trade agreement with Japan.

1712
01:38:01,020 --> 01:38:04,710
What's the carbon budget here? Like
what, how's their carbon behavior? Oh,

1713
01:38:04,711 --> 01:38:07,190
we're like, um, you know, this, um,

1714
01:38:07,720 --> 01:38:11,460
we're providing some public
subsidies for this factory over here.

1715
01:38:11,670 --> 01:38:13,470
What's their like emissions situation?

1716
01:38:13,471 --> 01:38:18,471
Like can we ask them to bring along
some carbon capture plant so that they

1717
01:38:18,930 --> 01:38:23,040
reduce their footprint? Um, you
know, every, at every level,

1718
01:38:23,160 --> 01:38:26,130
the level of the individual like talking
about buying a Tesla or buying a,

1719
01:38:26,140 --> 01:38:29,730
I'm buying a range rover or whatever.
Um,

1720
01:38:30,420 --> 01:38:31,590
I think we'll start to think in,

1721
01:38:31,640 --> 01:38:36,000
in the term in terms of carbon and that'll
be a sign of just how total climate

1722
01:38:36,001 --> 01:38:36,834
change will have,

1723
01:38:36,960 --> 01:38:41,610
how totally climate change will have
conquered the world so that there won't be

1724
01:38:41,611 --> 01:38:45,750
an aspect of modern life that will be
not just untouched, but in a certain way.

1725
01:38:45,751 --> 01:38:50,250
Kind of ungoverned by
it. Yeah. What about,

1726
01:38:51,030 --> 01:38:54,270
is there a way to educate people

1727
01:38:54,780 --> 01:38:58,620
in a way that's not preachy, that sort
of moves the needle in that direction?

1728
01:38:58,621 --> 01:39:00,330
I think conversations
like this are important.

1729
01:39:00,331 --> 01:39:02,550
I think your book's very
important and I think, you know,

1730
01:39:02,790 --> 01:39:05,460
interviews that I'm sure you're doing
right now on all these different shows are

1731
01:39:05,461 --> 01:39:09,120
important and everything kind
of like ups the needle or obs,

1732
01:39:09,270 --> 01:39:10,830
the perception of it a little bit.

1733
01:39:10,831 --> 01:39:14,520
But is there anything else it can be
done that can educate people in a way

1734
01:39:14,521 --> 01:39:17,170
that's, it's not preachy
or it's not, it doesn't,

1735
01:39:17,180 --> 01:39:20,640
it's not aggressive in a way
that annoys people because yeah,

1736
01:39:20,860 --> 01:39:24,680
it's a horrible thing to say,
but like the same way we're like,

1737
01:39:24,690 --> 01:39:29,640
we need sugar in the medicine. You
know, I like the song from Mary Poppins.

1738
01:39:29,720 --> 01:39:33,100
Yeah, I mean I think in
general like climate messaging,

1739
01:39:33,110 --> 01:39:36,020
climate communication has really suffered
for a long time because it was so

1740
01:39:36,021 --> 01:39:38,900
preachy and blue because
it was so holier than now.

1741
01:39:39,090 --> 01:39:40,820
And because the people
that get involved in it,

1742
01:39:40,821 --> 01:39:43,550
part of the reason why they get involved
in it's virtue signaling. Totally.

1743
01:39:43,910 --> 01:39:45,650
And I've been asked like,
you know,

1744
01:39:45,680 --> 01:39:47,990
as I've been proven up promoting
the book by a lot of people,

1745
01:39:48,320 --> 01:39:51,440
like what have you done to in your life
to change? You know, and it's like, well,

1746
01:39:51,680 --> 01:39:53,960
I'm flying a little bit less flying.
Really makes me feel guilty.

1747
01:39:53,961 --> 01:39:57,110
But otherwise I basically haven't
changed anything because I do think that

1748
01:39:57,170 --> 01:40:00,140
politics and policy are the most
important impact you can have.

1749
01:40:00,141 --> 01:40:04,010
And I'm like spreading the word whether
I eat like a couple of fewer hamburgers

1750
01:40:04,011 --> 01:40:05,690
a year,
it just doesn't really matter that much.

1751
01:40:06,050 --> 01:40:11,050
But the idea that you would ask a newcomer
to the movement to demonstrate their

1752
01:40:14,270 --> 01:40:19,270
commitment by making themselves the most
optimally committed that they possibly

1753
01:40:19,371 --> 01:40:22,070
could be, that's just going
to alienate so many people.

1754
01:40:22,490 --> 01:40:26,570
And this is obviously a issue where we
need more people engaged in a more direct

1755
01:40:26,571 --> 01:40:30,350
profound way. So I think for me it's like
anyone who wants to care about climate,

1756
01:40:30,351 --> 01:40:34,780
who wants to vote about climate, like come
on, like, um, and I think that, you know,

1757
01:40:34,840 --> 01:40:37,850
Hollywood can be really important here.
Um, I mean, since I've been out here,

1758
01:40:37,851 --> 01:40:38,260
I've been,

1759
01:40:38,260 --> 01:40:42,110
I have a couple of meetings about shows
and stuff and I do think that we've had

1760
01:40:42,111 --> 01:40:47,111
really corny storytelling about climate
change and that there are actually

1761
01:40:47,661 --> 01:40:52,520
opportunities for like really incredible
new kinds of storytelling. I mean,

1762
01:40:52,521 --> 01:40:55,810
in the book I about this
story that happened a couple
of years ago where, okay,

1763
01:40:56,080 --> 01:40:56,913
mmm,

1764
01:40:59,650 --> 01:41:01,340
you know,
anthrax that was,

1765
01:41:02,090 --> 01:41:05,870
had killed a reindeer in Russia
in the early 20th century.

1766
01:41:05,871 --> 01:41:09,020
The ranger was frozen in permafrost
for the entire 20th century.

1767
01:41:09,800 --> 01:41:11,690
Permafrost melted,
the reindeer thawed,

1768
01:41:11,691 --> 01:41:15,950
the anthrax was released and killed
at least one boy and a number of other

1769
01:41:15,951 --> 01:41:18,710
reindeer in Russia. Wow. And that is true.

1770
01:41:18,711 --> 01:41:21,530
So in the ice in the Arctic ice are,
you know,

1771
01:41:21,560 --> 01:41:24,020
we know of rock is like a
record of geological history.

1772
01:41:24,040 --> 01:41:25,820
Ice is also record of geological history.

1773
01:41:25,821 --> 01:41:28,610
So they're like the bubonic
plague is trapped in ice.

1774
01:41:28,990 --> 01:41:33,140
The Spanish flu in the from h 1918 that
killed hundreds of millions of people is

1775
01:41:33,141 --> 01:41:33,974
trapped in ice.

1776
01:41:34,400 --> 01:41:39,400
There are diseases trapped in the Arctic
ice from before humans were around,

1777
01:41:40,160 --> 01:41:45,160
which means that humans immune
system have no experience with them.

1778
01:41:46,370 --> 01:41:50,900
There's so many horror movies you can
make about this subject. Um, Holy Shit,

1779
01:41:50,901 --> 01:41:51,860
I didn't even think of that.

1780
01:41:51,890 --> 01:41:55,370
I didn't know that the Spanish flu
is trapped in ice. Yeah, I mean,

1781
01:41:55,400 --> 01:41:58,850
and there have been instances where
like in lab conditions anyway,

1782
01:41:59,330 --> 01:42:03,500
they've revived bacteria that
are millions of years old.

1783
01:42:04,130 --> 01:42:04,550
Um,

1784
01:42:04,550 --> 01:42:09,550
one Russian doctor literally injected a
bacteria that he had revived from like

1785
01:42:10,190 --> 01:42:13,310
35,000 years ago.
It had been frozen for 35,000 years.

1786
01:42:13,490 --> 01:42:17,270
He brought it back to life and injected
it into himself. Why would he do that?

1787
01:42:17,300 --> 01:42:20,060
Just to see what would,
that's a fucking marvel comic book.

1788
01:42:20,390 --> 01:42:23,440
That's how you become like the,
the red scholar some. Yeah.

1789
01:42:23,600 --> 01:42:25,910
Well that's what I mean about this.
This story is so big.

1790
01:42:25,940 --> 01:42:29,060
It's like the world that we live in
in the next couple of decades will be

1791
01:42:29,061 --> 01:42:30,320
completely transformed.

1792
01:42:30,321 --> 01:42:33,800
Like we will be reading about
diseases coming out of the Arctic ice.

1793
01:42:34,040 --> 01:42:38,150
We will be reading about tropical diseases
arriving in Copenhagen because now

1794
01:42:38,151 --> 01:42:41,420
mosquitoes are there because
the temperature allows
them to live there and the

1795
01:42:41,421 --> 01:42:42,650
way that they never lived before.

1796
01:42:42,890 --> 01:42:47,750
We will be reading about climate conflict
will be reading about, you know, um,

1797
01:42:48,200 --> 01:42:51,230
I mean all this shit, it's,
it's, it's everywhere. You know,

1798
01:42:51,380 --> 01:42:55,560
air pollution increases the rates
of autism and Adhd. It changes, um,

1799
01:42:55,750 --> 01:43:00,650
the development of babies in utero.
It's like, it's all encompassing. Wow.

1800
01:43:00,860 --> 01:43:03,680
The disease in the ice thing
is really freaking me out.

1801
01:43:03,710 --> 01:43:05,310
I never even considered that.
Yeah.

1802
01:43:05,480 --> 01:43:08,420
But that is something to think about
along with the methane and carbon is going

1803
01:43:08,421 --> 01:43:11,960
to be emitted into the atmosphere as it
melts. Well, let me tell you this story.

1804
01:43:11,961 --> 01:43:16,390
So I'm there.
We now,

1805
01:43:16,550 --> 01:43:20,840
so there was there this, the species
of antelope called a saiga antelope.

1806
01:43:21,230 --> 01:43:23,060
They, um, they're mostly in Siberia.

1807
01:43:24,380 --> 01:43:27,590
They're kind of dwarf antelopes and
they've been around for millions of years.

1808
01:43:27,950 --> 01:43:31,940
And, uh, all of a sudden in 2016 or 2015,

1809
01:43:32,570 --> 01:43:37,130
they literally all died. It's called
a mega death. The entire species died.

1810
01:43:37,670 --> 01:43:41,020
They're extinct. They're
now extinct. Jesus. Um,

1811
01:43:41,180 --> 01:43:46,180
and that happened because a bacteria that
had been living inside their guts was

1812
01:43:49,550 --> 01:43:53,210
changed by conditions.
It was an unusually hot,

1813
01:43:53,211 --> 01:43:57,260
unusually humid summer. And this bacteria
that had been living inside them,

1814
01:43:57,350 --> 01:44:02,090
presumably for millions of years
comfortably as a kind of peaceful,

1815
01:44:02,360 --> 01:44:07,360
cooperator became a killer
and killed the entire species.

1816
01:44:07,610 --> 01:44:12,610
Now we have inside us
countless bacteria and viruses.

1817
01:44:14,810 --> 01:44:18,740
Scientists believe
millions in every human.

1818
01:44:19,010 --> 01:44:21,770
So our guts are full of bacteria
that do our digestion for us.

1819
01:44:21,771 --> 01:44:24,060
They monitor our moods.
They're there. You know,

1820
01:44:24,080 --> 01:44:27,920
there are some scientists who think it's
really misleading to even think of the

1821
01:44:27,921 --> 01:44:31,960
human as a unitary animal rather than a
kind of composite creature with system.

1822
01:44:31,980 --> 01:44:32,813
Yeah.

1823
01:44:32,840 --> 01:44:37,400
And most of those bacteria and viruses
are not going to be dramatically

1824
01:44:37,401 --> 01:44:40,490
transformed by a degree
or two degrees of warming.

1825
01:44:40,820 --> 01:44:45,230
But there are so many of them.
The chances that one could,

1826
01:44:46,100 --> 01:44:49,520
it's hard to dismiss that and whether
that would mean we'd all immediately go

1827
01:44:49,521 --> 01:44:50,690
extinct,
probably not.

1828
01:44:50,840 --> 01:44:55,370
But what if that means suddenly
schizophrenia increases by 15% because

1829
01:44:55,371 --> 01:44:57,260
schizophrenia is related to,
um,

1830
01:44:57,310 --> 01:45:01,550
a bacterial infection called toxoplasma
guts things, bacteria Toxoplasma Gondii.

1831
01:45:01,960 --> 01:45:04,280
Um, well that's that cat
parasite. Yeah, exactly.

1832
01:45:04,650 --> 01:45:07,430
It was schizophrenia is related
to that. Yeah. Really? Yeah.

1833
01:45:07,431 --> 01:45:10,900
I'd like triples your chances of
getting schizophrenia. Wow. Yeah. Um,

1834
01:45:11,090 --> 01:45:14,900
and our bodies are so complex,
such intricate ecosystems.

1835
01:45:14,901 --> 01:45:17,960
Like you say that if one
little thing gets disturbed,

1836
01:45:18,080 --> 01:45:20,180
it could have really
catastrophic impacts on us.

1837
01:45:20,181 --> 01:45:23,040
And that's true of the planet as a whole.
I think that's,

1838
01:45:23,220 --> 01:45:26,720
that's one of the big lessons of my book
is that this is such a delicate system.

1839
01:45:26,960 --> 01:45:30,110
It's been stable for all of human
history and now it's not stable.

1840
01:45:30,320 --> 01:45:32,360
What that means for how we live,
we don't know yet,

1841
01:45:32,361 --> 01:45:34,640
but the changes will be significant,
will be profound.

1842
01:45:34,880 --> 01:45:37,430
But it's also true of the individual.
You know,

1843
01:45:37,460 --> 01:45:42,020
our bodies will be living differently in
a world that's two degrees warmer than

1844
01:45:42,021 --> 01:45:44,840
they are today. We can't really
predict what those impacts will be,

1845
01:45:44,841 --> 01:45:46,220
but it could be quite dramatic.

1846
01:45:46,550 --> 01:45:49,900
And they could be things that we can't
even imagine today because they're,

1847
01:45:50,350 --> 01:45:51,440
you know,
by some counts,

1848
01:45:51,470 --> 01:45:54,440
millions of bacteria inside us that
we haven't even identified yet.

1849
01:45:55,880 --> 01:45:59,410
Jesus Christ, you're freaking
me out, David. God dammit.

1850
01:45:59,480 --> 01:46:00,500
It's a crazy world out there.

1851
01:46:00,760 --> 01:46:05,300
It will, not just crazy,
but it seems like when,

1852
01:46:05,301 --> 01:46:06,750
when you're talking
about things like this,

1853
01:46:06,751 --> 01:46:10,470
when you talking about climate change
affecting our actual gut parasites or our

1854
01:46:10,471 --> 01:46:14,250
gut biome and that this literally could
change the way human beings behave.

1855
01:46:15,310 --> 01:46:19,380
I mean, these are all things that I've
never heard discussed and it, it just,

1856
01:46:19,870 --> 01:46:23,310
it's really terrifying,
really is, you know, I mean,

1857
01:46:23,580 --> 01:46:27,090
and part of the problem is people hear
like, oh, relax, everything's fine.

1858
01:46:27,210 --> 01:46:32,210
This is this constant thing that we do
where if it's not effecting us currently,

1859
01:46:32,791 --> 01:46:35,340
right now in the moment,
there's not a fire in front of us.

1860
01:46:35,430 --> 01:46:38,480
We don't worry about it.
It's a weird compartment,

1861
01:46:38,910 --> 01:46:41,340
compartmentalization thing
that human beings do.

1862
01:46:41,950 --> 01:46:45,190
Yeah. And um, it's, you know,

1863
01:46:45,660 --> 01:46:47,800
you'd think that evolution would
have trained us differently.

1864
01:46:47,830 --> 01:46:51,720
You think that evolution would have us
over time to have at least some long term

1865
01:46:52,290 --> 01:46:56,280
capacity. And I guess we do have some
longterm planning capacity, but it's, um,

1866
01:46:57,030 --> 01:47:00,540
we choose to think in really short
term ways just about all the time.

1867
01:47:00,810 --> 01:47:05,620
Now you've already freaked me out. How's
your book? And a freak me out more. Um,

1868
01:47:05,670 --> 01:47:09,780
I mean, it's every page, every
page is more of this. Jesus man.

1869
01:47:10,430 --> 01:47:12,180
How do you sleep at
night? You okay? I mean,

1870
01:47:12,181 --> 01:47:15,950
I sleep through compartmentalization and
denial to, I'm not, I'm not, you know,

1871
01:47:16,050 --> 01:47:17,850
I mentioned earlier like the,
and I think there's,

1872
01:47:17,910 --> 01:47:19,800
it's been a problem for
environmentalism for a long time.

1873
01:47:19,801 --> 01:47:22,350
This kind of holier than thou thing.
That's not who I am.

1874
01:47:22,351 --> 01:47:23,400
I'm not an environmentalist.

1875
01:47:23,430 --> 01:47:26,010
Until a couple of years ago when I
started really worrying about this stuff,

1876
01:47:26,430 --> 01:47:30,900
I had the same disinclination to take
it seriously that than most people do.

1877
01:47:31,050 --> 01:47:32,670
You know,
I thought climate change was real.

1878
01:47:32,850 --> 01:47:35,250
I thought it was something that we
need to worry about and deal with.

1879
01:47:35,490 --> 01:47:39,060
But I thought it was like a small problem
that could be dealt with without much

1880
01:47:39,330 --> 01:47:44,130
change to my life.
And I still basically feel that way.

1881
01:47:44,131 --> 01:47:46,860
I mean, I, you know, I like
going on vacations in nature,

1882
01:47:46,861 --> 01:47:50,760
but I'm not someone who's like spends
months hiking that trail or whatever.

1883
01:47:51,030 --> 01:47:54,900
I've never even had a pet. I don't
love animals, you know? But my,

1884
01:47:55,290 --> 01:47:56,430
the more I looked at the science,

1885
01:47:56,431 --> 01:48:01,431
the more I just realized this isn't
about affecting some part of nature over

1886
01:48:01,591 --> 01:48:05,400
there.
It's about effecting all of human life,

1887
01:48:05,401 --> 01:48:07,740
every aspect of human life
as it's lived on this planet.

1888
01:48:07,980 --> 01:48:10,500
And that really terrified me.
But even knowing that,

1889
01:48:10,501 --> 01:48:12,120
even staring at him straight in the face,

1890
01:48:12,420 --> 01:48:15,660
I mean I still get up in the morning and
you know, whatever, do the same shit,

1891
01:48:15,690 --> 01:48:19,080
go to the gym, watch
basketball, go to my day job.

1892
01:48:19,470 --> 01:48:24,430
And I don't think that we
should be ashamed of that. Um,

1893
01:48:24,570 --> 01:48:28,500
I think all of us have, are going to
have different reactions to this story,

1894
01:48:28,950 --> 01:48:33,420
different perspectives on the crisis.
And that's good. That's human.

1895
01:48:33,900 --> 01:48:34,650
Um,

1896
01:48:34,650 --> 01:48:39,350
but spreading the word generally making
people a little more alarmed is going to

1897
01:48:39,351 --> 01:48:42,960
make people take some more action
and that's what we need. Um,

1898
01:48:43,980 --> 01:48:47,160
but you know, the psychological,
like I said before,

1899
01:48:47,161 --> 01:48:50,370
the psychological biases are so strong
that like when I imagine my daughter's

1900
01:48:50,371 --> 01:48:54,900
life, I'm not imagining a
hellscape. I'm imagining the life,

1901
01:48:54,930 --> 01:48:58,380
the world that I grew up in.
And again,

1902
01:48:58,381 --> 01:49:01,260
that's not like that's how everybody,

1903
01:49:02,040 --> 01:49:06,900
that's how everybody relates relates to
the world and it's just a a reminder of

1904
01:49:06,901 --> 01:49:11,580
how important it is to
look really directly at the
science because the world as

1905
01:49:11,581 --> 01:49:16,170
it exists today is not a good guide to
the world that we will be living in in a

1906
01:49:16,170 --> 01:49:16,440
decade or two.

1907
01:49:16,440 --> 01:49:20,550
There's no way that the climate system
as it exists today will be stabilized

1908
01:49:20,940 --> 01:49:25,230
forever. It will get harder. All
of these things will get worse.

1909
01:49:25,290 --> 01:49:27,030
Every tick upward of
temperature we'll make,

1910
01:49:27,150 --> 01:49:30,570
we'll create more climate sufferings
somewhere in the world and if we get to

1911
01:49:30,571 --> 01:49:34,470
really dramatic levels of warming, that
suffering will be basically everywhere.

1912
01:49:36,360 --> 01:49:41,220
We can't continue orienting
our perspective on the
future on the world as it is

1913
01:49:41,221 --> 01:49:41,521
today.

1914
01:49:41,521 --> 01:49:45,720
We have to take seriously this range of
temperature temperature's two degrees to

1915
01:49:45,721 --> 01:49:50,721
four degrees that we're on track for
the century as a way of generating

1916
01:49:51,011 --> 01:49:55,990
sufficient activity and response
and adapting as we need to.

1917
01:49:56,170 --> 01:49:59,260
If we keep looking out the window
and thinking the world is, it is now,

1918
01:49:59,261 --> 01:50:01,390
will continue,
we're not going to do anything.

1919
01:50:01,690 --> 01:50:06,490
And that's what we've done over the last
30 years, which has been catastrophic.

1920
01:50:07,180 --> 01:50:09,400
I think that message is really important.

1921
01:50:09,430 --> 01:50:13,630
And I think that also the message of
that we need to change and evolve as a

1922
01:50:13,631 --> 01:50:17,890
civilization. But as a human being, you
need to still enjoy your life and that,

1923
01:50:17,980 --> 01:50:20,830
you know, it just, it's, it's
a, it's not a, Oh my God,

1924
01:50:20,831 --> 01:50:24,700
I need to drop everything I'm doing. That
leaves any sort of a carbon footprint.

1925
01:50:25,000 --> 01:50:28,720
It's, we need to address
it as a civilization. Yeah.
And I mean, you know, the,

1926
01:50:28,721 --> 01:50:33,721
if the average American had the carbon
footprint of the average European

1927
01:50:34,990 --> 01:50:37,090
Americans,
carbon emissions would fall by like 35%.

1928
01:50:37,480 --> 01:50:40,120
Now I don't think of lights the
difference. What do they do differently?

1929
01:50:40,150 --> 01:50:44,260
They drive less. They, it's weird
cause they make the best cars. Yeah.

1930
01:50:44,860 --> 01:50:48,970
But it's like less territory. Yeah.
Um, I mean there aren't many people in,

1931
01:50:49,030 --> 01:50:51,720
in Europe who like commute an
hour and a half to work everyday.

1932
01:50:51,760 --> 01:50:54,100
And that's like not so
uncommon in America. Um,

1933
01:50:54,310 --> 01:50:57,570
their diet is better carbon wise
and they have more, you know,

1934
01:50:57,660 --> 01:51:00,970
they have some more aggressive,
um, green energy stuff going on.

1935
01:51:01,120 --> 01:51:05,350
How's your diet better? Carbon was they
just, they waste less food basically.

1936
01:51:05,500 --> 01:51:08,980
So like a third of all American food,
I think it's a third is wasted.

1937
01:51:10,390 --> 01:51:15,030
That's just wasted carbon.
Yeah. Um, and you know,

1938
01:51:15,380 --> 01:51:20,080
I think the number of electricity is like
70% of American electricity is wasted

1939
01:51:20,290 --> 01:51:21,730
because how bad the grid is.

1940
01:51:21,731 --> 01:51:24,190
Like it just is so bad at
delivering from one source.

1941
01:51:24,370 --> 01:51:27,790
This is one reason why it's solar city
is so important because the battery can

1942
01:51:27,791 --> 01:51:31,120
be a much more efficient, um,
transporter of electricity. Well,

1943
01:51:31,121 --> 01:51:35,650
there's just no excuse for California.
I mean, other than this saw this winter,

1944
01:51:35,950 --> 01:51:37,810
it's sunny every day.
Yeah.

1945
01:51:38,560 --> 01:51:41,080
But so if 70% of American
electricity is wasted,

1946
01:51:41,081 --> 01:51:45,510
it's like we're just throwing
all that carbon and Alyssa.
Yeah. That's giant. Yeah.

1947
01:51:46,100 --> 01:51:49,080
Um, and if we were less
wasteful, we'd have, you know,

1948
01:51:49,090 --> 01:51:50,380
less of a problem on our hands,

1949
01:51:50,770 --> 01:51:53,410
but we still like order twice as much
food as we want. And then throw it out.

1950
01:51:53,411 --> 01:51:56,180
I mean, I did that. Yeah. Yeah. Um,

1951
01:51:56,470 --> 01:52:00,310
so you can understand why someone would
say to you like, what are you doing?

1952
01:52:00,460 --> 01:52:03,820
But it's that sentiment behind it
that's kind of gross, right? Yeah.

1953
01:52:03,850 --> 01:52:06,670
It's like they're looking for you to be
a hypocrite. They're trying to catch you.

1954
01:52:06,900 --> 01:52:09,940
Well, when I look at hypocrisy,
what I see is like, you know,

1955
01:52:09,970 --> 01:52:13,690
you want the world to be a better
place than you yourself are doing. Yes.

1956
01:52:13,750 --> 01:52:15,280
It's like that to me,
there's a way of,

1957
01:52:15,550 --> 01:52:17,860
it's like we think of hypocrisy
as like a negative quality.

1958
01:52:17,861 --> 01:52:20,140
I think it's kind of a positive.
It can be a positive quality.

1959
01:52:20,380 --> 01:52:25,000
You believe we should be
behaving in a way. Yeah. Yeah.

1960
01:52:25,180 --> 01:52:27,700
And he's like, I need to
adjust. Like you're saying,

1961
01:52:27,880 --> 01:52:30,610
not just what everybody needs to do,
what we need to do as well.

1962
01:52:30,640 --> 01:52:33,940
You're being conscious of this
need to change and like, you know,

1963
01:52:33,970 --> 01:52:37,210
if someone believes in,
say like better healthcare,

1964
01:52:37,720 --> 01:52:41,680
we don't ask them to donate all
of their money to hospitals.

1965
01:52:42,010 --> 01:52:45,980
That's what taxation is for.
Policy directs

1966
01:52:46,640 --> 01:52:51,050
our cultural energy towards targets
that we want to reach. So again,

1967
01:52:51,051 --> 01:52:54,740
as a civilization, we need to adjust.
Yeah. And as a, an individual,

1968
01:52:54,741 --> 01:52:59,741
we need to be aware so that we promote
and support this idea of a civilization

1969
01:53:00,021 --> 01:53:04,850
shifting. Yeah. Yeah. Listen,
man. Thank you. Thanks for
scaring the shit out of me.

1970
01:53:05,210 --> 01:53:07,500
Thanks for coming down
here. Uh, tell people, uh,

1971
01:53:07,560 --> 01:53:10,280
with the name of your book one more time,
please call the uninhabitable earth.

1972
01:53:10,580 --> 01:53:14,630
The subtitle is life after
warming. It's on my Instagram. Um,

1973
01:53:14,660 --> 01:53:18,410
and we'll put a link to it on Amazon, on
Twitter. And thank you, David. Oh, man.

1974
01:53:18,411 --> 01:53:21,280
Great to meet Shit, man. It's
great to meet you too. Good
luck with your book, man.

1975
01:53:21,281 --> 01:53:23,500
And really, I think it's gonna
make a big impact. Thank you.

1976
01:53:32,230 --> 01:53:33,710
Yeah.
Okay.
