1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,880
Believe in wireless, he needs to
see it. Boom. And we're alive.

2
00:00:04,890 --> 00:00:07,350
What's that bridge? How are you man spot
maybe let's go on. They're doing this.

3
00:00:07,351 --> 00:00:10,170
I really appreciate it. Thank you
for having me on the show, man. Well,

4
00:00:10,171 --> 00:00:15,171
I read about you a fellow Boston native
and I've read about your Tesla journey

5
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:20,220
and I was like, this is a
fucking interesting story.
This guy buys a broken Tesla,

6
00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:23,370
right? And then you couldn't
get parts for it anywhere.

7
00:00:24,030 --> 00:00:27,980
So what had happened to the car? It
had been in an accident. No. So the, I,

8
00:00:27,981 --> 00:00:30,080
I met the previous owner and he actually,

9
00:00:30,100 --> 00:00:33,570
I was think it was during Hurricane
Sandy. He thought that, uh, he goes,

10
00:00:33,571 --> 00:00:37,230
wait a minute, that water level seems
a low enough me to drive through it.

11
00:00:37,650 --> 00:00:40,340
And he just had a driving through the
water. I think it got up to like the, uh,

12
00:00:40,380 --> 00:00:44,940
almost like the B pillar. Oh No. Where
his neck is. Yeah. Yeah, I know. Right.

13
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:49,190
So he thought he could fight the
water. He lost obviously. And um,

14
00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:51,810
it was just underwater and I'm like,
you know what, I got to try this thing.

15
00:00:51,870 --> 00:00:54,360
And so what,
what would Tesla do in that situation?

16
00:00:54,361 --> 00:00:57,180
If he wanted to bring it back to them?
They would have to rebuild the entire car.

17
00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:01,110
They wouldn't even do it because at that
point, uh, once, uh, anything liquid,

18
00:01:01,410 --> 00:01:04,650
you know, any kind of like water
intrusion happens at an e v face. Right.

19
00:01:04,651 --> 00:01:07,130
The whole car off insurance companies
just like, we're not going to do it.

20
00:01:07,131 --> 00:01:09,000
Too risky. Too risky, not worth it.

21
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:14,120
Were you aware of the Fisker a dilemma
at the hurricane sandy when they had a,

22
00:01:14,950 --> 00:01:18,630
the Fiskars that were parked at the,
it was like at a,

23
00:01:18,690 --> 00:01:22,440
some sort of a doc right to ship.
They all exploded.

24
00:01:22,590 --> 00:01:24,450
They all burned water level rose.

25
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:28,380
The water got into them and they just
went off and they fucking fire loss the

26
00:01:28,381 --> 00:01:30,690
whole bunch of them. Yeah.
Look, this is a video of it.

27
00:01:31,050 --> 00:01:33,450
You could watch the video
of them fucking blowing up.

28
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:37,500
So as the water level rose and then
you'd see the water breaching. Yeah.

29
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:40,230
Well the water gets to the cars
and when it gets to the cars,

30
00:01:40,231 --> 00:01:43,200
they just start going off like,
fucking fuck all. Yeah. Oh yeah,

31
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:47,460
I know that feeling. Oh yeah, let's
look at that. Boom, boom, boom.

32
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:52,350
I know.
It was like a supernova.

33
00:01:52,410 --> 00:01:56,500
I mean those are big ass fucking
batteries. Just blowing that slideshow.

34
00:01:57,430 --> 00:02:01,770
It turns night in the day. It's amazing
how many, they lost like 40 cards up,

35
00:02:01,790 --> 00:02:04,680
Nigga. They lost a fuck load and
the company essentially went,

36
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:08,610
they went radio silent. Yeah, for
like a year. That's a bigL to take.

37
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:15,090
Once they realize their car could just
explode out. That's not good. Sorry,

38
00:02:15,091 --> 00:02:17,900
what happened? This, this video po? I
didn't look at the name of the video.

39
00:02:17,910 --> 00:02:20,130
It popped up when I typed it
into the Fisker explosion,

40
00:02:20,131 --> 00:02:23,520
but this was the explosion of the con
Ed plant. Oh, that's a big difference.

41
00:02:24,990 --> 00:02:29,280
That was a John [inaudible] those cars.

42
00:02:29,780 --> 00:02:32,790
But there is a video of the actual
Fiskars exploding, isn't there?

43
00:02:33,090 --> 00:02:36,630
There's definitely pictures. Pictures.
The second video won't be as exciting now.

44
00:02:37,380 --> 00:02:41,870
Yeah, let's leave it off. Fuck it.
This information set us back an hour.

45
00:02:41,930 --> 00:02:44,610
So that's the cars. That's
what it was left to them. Wow.

46
00:02:44,660 --> 00:02:48,240
And they all fucking blew up. It's
a beautiful car though. Fisker.

47
00:02:48,241 --> 00:02:51,380
Did a great job of making a car.
That looks really good. Right.

48
00:02:51,390 --> 00:02:52,470
But you know what's funny?
I,

49
00:02:53,180 --> 00:02:56,250
I think the backends kind of ugly to
you think the front was like a fish.

50
00:02:56,490 --> 00:02:59,040
The back's kind of ugly and that
actually, have you ever driven one? No.

51
00:02:59,140 --> 00:03:01,930
Been in one. When you drive
one you'll be like, ah,

52
00:03:01,931 --> 00:03:05,860
I get why this doesn't work out well
Justin Bieber had a all chrome one.

53
00:03:05,890 --> 00:03:09,400
I remember that dad. Does he still have
it though? Cause you still have it.

54
00:03:09,430 --> 00:03:11,020
He probably, he probably
doesn't even know. Yeah,

55
00:03:11,021 --> 00:03:13,210
he probably doesn't know at this point.
Yeah. You know the amount of money.

56
00:03:13,211 --> 00:03:16,410
That dude myself probably has no idea
if he has that car. Little kitten.

57
00:03:16,530 --> 00:03:20,390
It's got it tucked away somewhere. But
what do they drive? Like they're just,

58
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:22,630
they're just not really great card.
It's not really a driver's car.

59
00:03:23,410 --> 00:03:27,560
It's a two plus two. The a the center
keeps thing like you're closer to, sorry.

60
00:03:27,810 --> 00:03:29,300
Sorry.
Can moves around if you want to take away.

61
00:03:29,890 --> 00:03:31,510
The center console is super wide.

62
00:03:31,511 --> 00:03:35,440
It's a super awkward car to drive and
it's not really good at really anything,

63
00:03:35,830 --> 00:03:39,150
you know, it doesn't styling
wise, I'm like, yeah.

64
00:03:40,070 --> 00:03:43,810
So you think that back end looks ugly?
I don't think I could that much. No. No,

65
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:46,510
but you know what's funny?
The chroma isn't looked that bad.

66
00:03:47,230 --> 00:03:49,090
Some guy got arrested in Germany.

67
00:03:49,091 --> 00:03:54,091
They pulled them over and it compounds
it his car cause he had a gold shiny wrap

68
00:03:54,821 --> 00:03:56,500
on it. Right. It was a two
reflective or something.

69
00:03:56,550 --> 00:04:00,940
I see now there's a couple of instances
they'll let you do that in America,

70
00:04:00,970 --> 00:04:02,500
but in Germany they're like,
fuck off.

71
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:09,580
They took that Shit Bruh. You
know, they're like harsh, cold,

72
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:12,620
stoic folk, you know, they
don't want you doing that.

73
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:15,340
They don't want you flexing too
much over there. Not Too much. No.

74
00:04:15,580 --> 00:04:19,630
I bet they were like reluctantly are
making cars like super flashy for like

75
00:04:19,631 --> 00:04:24,160
American markets and shit. I think
so too. I, you know, I wonder.

76
00:04:25,220 --> 00:04:27,610
You think so? I don't know.
I don't know. Yeah, I me,

77
00:04:27,611 --> 00:04:29,260
I wonder how much of an influence it has.

78
00:04:29,261 --> 00:04:32,850
Like if you could leave
them to themselves, right.
What kind of crops did they,

79
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:37,060
yeah. Yeah, cause I feel like
so much of it is market driven,

80
00:04:38,020 --> 00:04:38,770
but they,

81
00:04:38,770 --> 00:04:43,770
when it comes to like engineering and
handling like God damn German cars have it

82
00:04:44,531 --> 00:04:47,980
nailed. They really do. They really do
nail, you know what the Americans are.

83
00:04:48,130 --> 00:04:50,200
They were trying to sneak up
and get clothes for a while.

84
00:04:50,530 --> 00:04:52,570
But I mean like the Germans
just this, this, this,

85
00:04:52,571 --> 00:04:56,800
the standard benchmark for every place
for the Americans fuck with it is like,

86
00:04:56,830 --> 00:04:59,990
have you ever driven a
Camaro? Zl One I have. Yeah.

87
00:05:00,250 --> 00:05:04,910
That's a preposterous car. It's an awesome
car. It's amazing. I have a um, uh,

88
00:05:04,911 --> 00:05:09,460
a corvette, z o six oh six
oh six, which is, you know,

89
00:05:09,461 --> 00:05:11,950
the [inaudible] seven liter and uh,

90
00:05:12,220 --> 00:05:16,710
it's an insane Chi by today's standards.
It already has like 505 horsepower.

91
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:21,310
Funny. But like, it's, it's not a lot.
It's a mean. It's a mean car. The car,

92
00:05:21,311 --> 00:05:23,560
I'll put you on your ass really
quick, man. Talking to a man,

93
00:05:23,620 --> 00:05:28,090
our friend Taylor out there was telling
us that they put a a Tesla in ludicrous

94
00:05:28,091 --> 00:05:33,091
mode on a dyno and it had
some insane number of Torque,

95
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:33,970
right?

96
00:05:33,970 --> 00:05:38,770
900 pound pound feet of
Torque and somewhere in the
neighborhood of a thousand

97
00:05:38,771 --> 00:05:40,660
horsepower and the dyno
could believe and read it.

98
00:05:40,690 --> 00:05:42,920
A lot of times they even go that
high in a lot of cases. Yeah,

99
00:05:43,570 --> 00:05:46,180
they're insane cars, man. I'm telling
you, the Americans know how to do it now.

100
00:05:46,181 --> 00:05:49,090
I think it's interesting that you know,

101
00:05:49,091 --> 00:05:50,920
people don't realize this
when they see a Tesla,

102
00:05:50,950 --> 00:05:53,950
it's a fully American car and they don't
realize that. They're just like, oh,

103
00:05:53,951 --> 00:05:56,440
it's probably something like,
you know, German or Japanese car,

104
00:05:56,441 --> 00:06:00,260
but the is 100% made here. Is
this it right here, Jamie? Yes.

105
00:06:00,980 --> 00:06:05,090
Is this the, which model is
this p 100 days. 100 days.

106
00:06:05,091 --> 00:06:08,840
So that's the biggest one. So what
does it say? Cause on a Mustang dyno.

107
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:13,640
So we're going to go from like
a 20 mile an hour roll sound.

108
00:06:13,670 --> 00:06:17,290
Like these little boys will
tell you this Tesla or a peer,

109
00:06:17,291 --> 00:06:21,320
or figure out how fast she goes.
I think I can get it to jump.

110
00:06:21,430 --> 00:06:24,830
I thought it said 56 six. Yeah.
No, I think it a look at them. Hey,

111
00:06:24,980 --> 00:06:28,370
even almost jumps off the dyno at
this point. There's so much torque.

112
00:06:29,750 --> 00:06:32,250
Yeah, it's a very, very, very powerful car

113
00:06:40,850 --> 00:06:42,500
when I'm trying to describe it to people,

114
00:06:42,501 --> 00:06:44,420
especially people that have never
driven an electric car. I'm like,

115
00:06:44,421 --> 00:06:47,870
it doesn't even seem real.
It seems like it violates physics.

116
00:06:47,871 --> 00:06:49,490
So how do you like yours,
by the way? So I know.

117
00:06:49,550 --> 00:06:52,610
I know that Ilan Musk came
here and bamboos that you
into buying one pretty much.

118
00:06:53,310 --> 00:06:58,100
How dare you? I love it.
I love it. It's great,

119
00:06:58,101 --> 00:07:02,870
isn't it? It makes other cars
seemed stupid. Right? And I
love cars. Oh yeah. I know.

120
00:07:02,871 --> 00:07:06,560
You're a car guy. I loved them. I love
cars that don't even drive that fast.

121
00:07:06,590 --> 00:07:09,650
I love mechanical engineered excellence.

122
00:07:09,651 --> 00:07:13,160
I love that when people figure things out.
Right. Which is what brought me to you.

123
00:07:13,430 --> 00:07:17,160
I love the fact that you took this
car that was fucked up, right?

124
00:07:17,180 --> 00:07:19,490
And you refuse to let it go.

125
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:22,130
Do you like I'm going to figure
out how to fix this fucking thing.

126
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:25,610
How much did you buy it for? What? It was
15 grand. Just to be clear on something.

127
00:07:25,910 --> 00:07:28,370
I'm not like some like
evil genius or brainiac.

128
00:07:28,580 --> 00:07:33,580
This was driven by my cheapness because
I didn't want to spend the kind of money

129
00:07:33,681 --> 00:07:35,630
they were asking for one. Right? So,

130
00:07:35,631 --> 00:07:39,800
so basically this car is like 15 grand
and the whole story started with,

131
00:07:39,801 --> 00:07:43,130
my friend came over, he actually had a
job at Tesla and he's like, buddy, listen,

132
00:07:43,550 --> 00:07:47,660
do these crazy cars. I know you have a
zero six but this car is faster than that.

133
00:07:47,780 --> 00:07:49,790
You're going to love this thing. I
was like, that electric crap box.

134
00:07:49,791 --> 00:07:52,960
I don't want anything to do with that.
Whatever. Right? You brought the car over,

135
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:56,630
great looking car. I said all right and
I'll take it for a drive or whatever.

136
00:07:56,690 --> 00:08:00,080
And the thing was amazing,
right? Amazing car.

137
00:08:00,620 --> 00:08:03,340
So I was in tech and I'm
just like, listen, like,

138
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:05,960
like how much does this thing cost?
Like I make decent money, whatever.

139
00:08:05,961 --> 00:08:09,200
I'll just throw some money at it. And he's
like, listen, this will cost about 120.

140
00:08:09,201 --> 00:08:13,890
I said, you know what? Have
a nice day. I'm like, hi and
that shit. Um, and then he,

141
00:08:14,390 --> 00:08:17,540
so he laughed and I thought to myself like
every night I was like, you know what,

142
00:08:17,541 --> 00:08:20,780
I got to get my hands on one
of these cars, man. I got
to get one, like, you know,

143
00:08:20,990 --> 00:08:25,580
sell a kidney, whatever, sell a
testicle, whatever I can do. And it's,

144
00:08:25,610 --> 00:08:27,470
I was searching online and you know,

145
00:08:27,471 --> 00:08:32,150
at what happens is whenever a
car gets messed up, whenever
a car gets a, as I say,

146
00:08:32,151 --> 00:08:34,860
total than a way, and it's a
total loss and insurance company,

147
00:08:34,861 --> 00:08:37,580
you'll take it and they'll kind of
auction it off to like the highest bidder.

148
00:08:38,060 --> 00:08:41,950
So I went to an auction site and I
saw one for sale was like, you know,

149
00:08:41,951 --> 00:08:45,230
at 15 grand, they said it didn't
run her drive and it wasn't a flood.

150
00:08:45,660 --> 00:08:48,890
And I'm just like 15 grand. I could
do that. That's a piece of cake, man.

151
00:08:48,950 --> 00:08:50,750
Throw some money at it.
Whatever. How hard can it be?

152
00:08:51,110 --> 00:08:54,440
You stick it in a bag of rice and I tie
it up. He's like an iPhone, you know,

153
00:08:54,441 --> 00:08:56,040
you've got your iPhone on the
toilet. Right. You know what I mean?

154
00:08:56,041 --> 00:08:58,260
It's just like he had socks. Do you
want a bag of rice and you get to go.

155
00:08:58,650 --> 00:09:02,460
So I figured out how to do it just
by more rice for this thing. And uh,

156
00:09:02,490 --> 00:09:06,750
I got it home and um, I was
like, you know what, this is a,

157
00:09:06,751 --> 00:09:09,330
I got myself into some shit here,
cause this,

158
00:09:09,331 --> 00:09:13,110
it was a lot more work than I thought
it was going to be. Sight unseen.

159
00:09:14,180 --> 00:09:16,050
I didn't see that's,
that's the way it is the most times.

160
00:09:16,051 --> 00:09:18,030
They don't really let you on
the auction lots too often.

161
00:09:18,300 --> 00:09:20,770
So they took five photos
of it. It was, uh,

162
00:09:20,790 --> 00:09:24,430
some from the interior of some from
the side and one under the front.

163
00:09:24,990 --> 00:09:27,330
And I was just like, I could probably
do this right. And no big deal.

164
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:30,960
So this begins his project,
which takes how long from to completion?

165
00:09:31,290 --> 00:09:35,880
I think it took me about maybe six or
seven months or so of straight work. No.

166
00:09:35,881 --> 00:09:39,360
So I have, um, so I was
working at the time and uh,

167
00:09:39,390 --> 00:09:44,390
I think only between the hours of like
7:00 PM and like 11:00 PM like every

168
00:09:45,451 --> 00:09:49,320
night and then weekends for a few
hours until I figured it out. Yeah.

169
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:53,410
So goodbye social life pretty much.
Yeah. I was, I was a hermit for that,

170
00:09:53,420 --> 00:09:57,570
for those months. And what actually ended
up doing was, so I had the car right.

171
00:09:57,630 --> 00:10:00,570
So I was freaking out because my wife
was just like, how much was that thing?

172
00:10:00,571 --> 00:10:05,220
And like, I mean, of course. Yeah. She
had the divorce papers ready pretty much.

173
00:10:05,550 --> 00:10:09,600
And uh, oh, is that it? I
know this is a different one.

174
00:10:09,601 --> 00:10:12,750
That fucked up. Yeah, that was
really messed up. Now I couldn't say.

175
00:10:12,751 --> 00:10:16,980
How much did you get that one for? That
one was about bleep guests. Four grand.

176
00:10:17,020 --> 00:10:21,840
It was 20 grand. I paid for
that. Yes. Yes. Six total.

177
00:10:21,870 --> 00:10:24,460
Yeah, I know. But these, they're
so valuable, man. Really,

178
00:10:24,461 --> 00:10:26,750
because you know why it's the,
the,

179
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:30,360
the battery technology and the
motor technology that Tesla's using.

180
00:10:30,690 --> 00:10:33,660
Everyone's just dying for
that stuff, man. So any, any,

181
00:10:33,661 --> 00:10:38,100
any rec test so that you find minimum,
I know I'm spilling the secret sauce here.

182
00:10:38,310 --> 00:10:42,270
Minimum Worth 15 grand. Even if it looks
like that. Dead serious. That's insane.

183
00:10:42,271 --> 00:10:45,840
What that did is doesn't even have doors
yet. It took, I took the doors off,

184
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:48,890
put the battery pack is still in there.
Right.

185
00:10:48,900 --> 00:10:51,210
And the motor and the motor
was still in there too.

186
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:55,680
Do people take those and put them in like
old cars or anything yet? Absolutely.

187
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:56,461
It's a he,

188
00:10:56,461 --> 00:10:59,790
that's the new generation of hot rodders
cause I saw something like that about a

189
00:10:59,791 --> 00:11:03,630
Mustang. It was like a 65,
66 Mustang. It was electric,

190
00:11:03,660 --> 00:11:07,680
but I didn't know what train it
used. So, so you know how um,

191
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:11,310
you're a gear head, you
know this, the ls swap,

192
00:11:11,550 --> 00:11:15,810
they put literally an ls into
everything lands, Land Cruiser,

193
00:11:15,930 --> 00:11:19,800
Toyota Land Cruiser with one
ls. Swap went. Oh Shit. Um,

194
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:24,660
so that's the new ls swap basically. So
then the Tesla motor is the new ls swap.

195
00:11:24,690 --> 00:11:29,370
Everyone is swapping at Tesla motor until
you know Volkswagen bugs and to Audi's

196
00:11:29,371 --> 00:11:31,080
into, into Porsche's, into everything.

197
00:11:31,410 --> 00:11:35,700
Well I know that people are doing ls swaps
into nine 11th and Porsche people are

198
00:11:35,701 --> 00:11:39,990
losing their fucking minds eye now
taking old air cooled cars. Yup.

199
00:11:40,140 --> 00:11:43,740
Which are really notoriously difficult
to get to a high horsepower. Exactly.

200
00:11:43,770 --> 00:11:44,880
Cause those air cooled cars,

201
00:11:44,881 --> 00:11:47,420
like you can only get them like
around 400 plus horsepower.

202
00:11:47,421 --> 00:11:50,070
The days not crumbling unless your singer,
right?

203
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:54,070
Well they've got that insanely engineered
a new one. What does that called

204
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:56,770
Lionel late. Either way it's
going to cost you like you know,

205
00:11:56,860 --> 00:12:01,300
damn near $100,000 a day, 80 pounds
something dynamic, lightweight, something.

206
00:12:01,301 --> 00:12:05,620
It's the most gorgeous looking of those
portions have ever seen ever Sanders.

207
00:12:05,740 --> 00:12:09,010
And they built that one up to 500 plus
horsepower, right? Yes. That's a hundred.

208
00:12:09,011 --> 00:12:12,110
How much does it cost though? That's the
thing. Fucking million six. Exactly. Yeah.

209
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:15,400
Yeah. You can buy one
that's a giant house, man.

210
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:20,080
That's a house with land. You might
have a, well, actually that's not true.

211
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:24,520
And in La, that's not a house. No, but
la is not the real world. What is that?

212
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:28,840
67 Mustang meets Tesla.
Avr Motors,

213
00:12:28,841 --> 00:12:33,730
all electric muscle car. Holy Fuck.
That's a 68. That's a good looking too.

214
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:37,390
That's one of the best looking ends of any
car ever. An awesome looking car. Fuck,

215
00:12:37,391 --> 00:12:42,190
that looks incredible. 2.2
here to 60. There you go.

216
00:12:42,430 --> 00:12:44,940
What the fuck? So that's the
new, that's new. So there's,

217
00:12:45,170 --> 00:12:47,020
it was going to cost
you a ton of mark that

218
00:12:48,870 --> 00:12:53,760
it's going to cost you a ton of
money to recreate that same look. Uh,

219
00:12:53,910 --> 00:12:56,800
look, it has this nice screen to
what did, that's so weird though,

220
00:12:56,801 --> 00:12:58,600
to not shift a muscle car.

221
00:12:59,230 --> 00:13:03,250
I'm thinking about backing out and backing
it up. But you love your Tusla though.

222
00:13:03,251 --> 00:13:05,060
You don't shift that,
but it doesn't look like that.

223
00:13:05,061 --> 00:13:07,260
That would be a super ultra poser.
Right?

224
00:13:07,300 --> 00:13:12,000
The door handles come out like a test
doesn't test the doorhandles fuck off the

225
00:13:12,030 --> 00:13:16,800
next. No, no, no. There's
a company that does, um,

226
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:18,400
it's a company called Rev.
Ology.

227
00:13:18,580 --> 00:13:23,580
That makes me old like
1966 to like 68 mustangs.

228
00:13:25,930 --> 00:13:28,980
But they do it with all new parts.
Right.

229
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:33,010
And Modern Technical Resto Mod pretty
much not though because it's a new car

230
00:13:33,250 --> 00:13:36,130
there. They buy the full, um, that's uh,

231
00:13:36,310 --> 00:13:38,970
that's actually a brand new car
that's never existed. Oh really?

232
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:42,910
It's a ground up ground up built. They
buy the whole, you know, cause it's,

233
00:13:43,180 --> 00:13:45,850
I think it's called the unibody
construction. Is that what it is?

234
00:13:46,150 --> 00:13:49,600
There's something, the way that
these mustangs are constructed,

235
00:13:49,601 --> 00:13:54,601
the body's built into the frame and
they bought this company sells them like

236
00:13:54,701 --> 00:13:58,840
completed versions of the body kit that
are perfect with perfect tolerances.

237
00:13:58,841 --> 00:14:03,130
Right. So like that. Like it's like
that's when they're 67 Shelby gt 500.

238
00:14:03,131 --> 00:14:06,400
What's the pricing? Oh Wow. Stupid
expensive. Yeah. It's not going to work.

239
00:14:06,430 --> 00:14:10,360
It's like two Teslas. Yeah, pretty
much. Yeah. But they're dope.

240
00:14:10,630 --> 00:14:13,120
It's dope as fuck.
If you look at like what it looks like,

241
00:14:13,270 --> 00:14:16,110
go down and see some pictures of
it, Jamie, you'd get a better,

242
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:20,990
a better sense of it. But this
guy is meticulous. Yeah. Okay.

243
00:14:21,250 --> 00:14:23,020
This company's very meticulous.
I'm,

244
00:14:23,021 --> 00:14:25,630
I've been following their stuff for
quite a while and what they do is really

245
00:14:25,631 --> 00:14:29,560
incredible. Right? That's an all med, all
new sheet metal. I can, everything's new,

246
00:14:29,561 --> 00:14:34,561
but it has some killer brakes and it
has a modern coyote Mustang engine and a

247
00:14:35,250 --> 00:14:35,920
fibo.
Yup.

248
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:40,920
So it's a 460 horsepower engine and these
old ass muscle cars and that one's the

249
00:14:41,801 --> 00:14:44,270
gt 500 that one's actually supercharged.

250
00:14:44,290 --> 00:14:48,190
That has a 600 horsepower engine did
it's dub. They're fucking gorgeous.

251
00:14:48,370 --> 00:14:52,130
They're gorgeous cars. They're really
pretty. So, so what would you think

252
00:14:52,130 --> 00:14:54,680
about someone dropping an electric
motor on one of these things to see?

253
00:14:54,681 --> 00:14:58,400
I love it. Look, I love, I love people
doing crazy shit, but it's not for me.

254
00:14:58,640 --> 00:15:01,700
I need to shift if I'm driving that thing,
I got to pretend I'm Steve McQueen.

255
00:15:01,730 --> 00:15:05,900
I hear you man.
Here's the thing.

256
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:08,630
So what do you think about the new,
you seen the new Tesla roadster, right?

257
00:15:08,750 --> 00:15:10,920
Gorgeous. What do you think
about, I love it. Yeah,

258
00:15:10,940 --> 00:15:13,010
but it's theirs from the bottom up.
You know what I'm saying?

259
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:14,930
It's like I don't mind not shifting in it.

260
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:18,640
That thing seems like it's going to
literally punch a hole through space time

261
00:15:18,641 --> 00:15:20,210
though too, man. I think so too.

262
00:15:20,211 --> 00:15:23,150
I think they're looking at it like
zero to 60 in like one point something

263
00:15:23,151 --> 00:15:26,240
seconds. Yeah, I think it's one nine.
That's what they're saying. It's insane.

264
00:15:26,270 --> 00:15:30,980
That's bizarre. I know. It's crazy
when you feel it in the p 100 d mine,

265
00:15:31,220 --> 00:15:34,460
like everybody that I get in the car
and I stomp on the gas, they're like,

266
00:15:34,470 --> 00:15:38,540
they can't believe it. They can't believe
that these are around you. It's like,

267
00:15:38,660 --> 00:15:40,790
it's like vampires being around people,

268
00:15:40,820 --> 00:15:43,680
but people that can just leap to the
top of buildings that walking around and

269
00:15:43,870 --> 00:15:46,810
rec can regular until some shit
goes down. Yeah. No, they're,

270
00:15:46,820 --> 00:15:49,100
they're absolutely amazing
cars, man. And I think that's,

271
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:52,580
that's what the main reason why I was
like, I gotta get one of these man.

272
00:15:52,610 --> 00:15:56,180
So what one, what was the struggle?
Initial struggle. You have the car,

273
00:15:56,270 --> 00:15:58,190
you take it apart,
and what did you see?

274
00:15:58,550 --> 00:16:01,520
Pretty much I was kind of taking my time
because I knew there was a point where

275
00:16:01,521 --> 00:16:02,600
I couldn't fix the damn thing.

276
00:16:02,601 --> 00:16:04,610
And I was just kind of wasting
everyone's time and why it's like, Hey,

277
00:16:04,611 --> 00:16:08,690
is this thing almost done? I
was like, yeah, babe, don't
worry about it. We're good.

278
00:16:08,691 --> 00:16:10,940
Don't worry. Your money's safe. And, um,

279
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:14,360
so there's a certain point where I
took everything apart and I was like,

280
00:16:14,361 --> 00:16:18,110
all right, cool. I found a dead fish
in the back of the car by, so actually,

281
00:16:18,111 --> 00:16:20,910
you know what the turning point, this
whole thing, was that the turning point?

282
00:16:20,911 --> 00:16:20,990
Yeah,
it

283
00:16:20,990 --> 00:16:25,760
was, um, I, I realized it was
salt water and not fresh water.

284
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:28,730
So, you know what, saltwater does
this stuff, right? So it just,

285
00:16:28,731 --> 00:16:33,380
it just kills everything. So, uh, 90%
of the car was kind of toast. And,

286
00:16:33,381 --> 00:16:36,950
uh, I said to myself, all right,
I'm going to call Tesla, you know,

287
00:16:36,980 --> 00:16:39,620
buy a motor by a battery pack.
I'll be good. You know what I mean?

288
00:16:39,621 --> 00:16:43,520
Maybe I'll spend like 20 grand for a
battery and like maybe 10 for a motor,

289
00:16:43,521 --> 00:16:47,150
I'll be enrolling for 40. It's still
cheaper than a hundred. Right, right. So,

290
00:16:47,151 --> 00:16:49,880
so I called them up and uh, you
know, they were like, hey, you know,

291
00:16:49,881 --> 00:16:52,490
how's it going man? I was like, Hey, you
know what a crazy thing happened, right?

292
00:16:52,730 --> 00:16:55,990
So I bought this tussles
underwater and um,

293
00:16:56,210 --> 00:16:59,080
I need like a couple of things and either
battery, I need like a motor, you know,

294
00:16:59,110 --> 00:17:00,900
just, just throw me those things.
It's fine. They're like, well,

295
00:17:00,901 --> 00:17:02,660
we're not going to sell it
to, I was like, well, why not?

296
00:17:02,661 --> 00:17:05,840
Because you have no capability of
fixing the car yourself. You know,

297
00:17:05,841 --> 00:17:08,390
you're gonna get yourself killed.
It's not going to work. You know,

298
00:17:08,510 --> 00:17:11,120
give me your vin number. And I gave
them the vin number. They're like, no,

299
00:17:11,121 --> 00:17:13,350
that car is listed as salvage.
That thing was underwater.

300
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:16,580
We're not going to help you. And just hung
up the phone pretty. Ooh. Yeah. So like,

301
00:17:16,670 --> 00:17:19,980
this is the crazy part two is that
they know, you know, I'm putting,

302
00:17:19,981 --> 00:17:23,720
I'm a conspiracy theorist hat on.
They know where every single car is.

303
00:17:23,780 --> 00:17:26,540
They know what it's doing.
They know if the airbags went off,

304
00:17:26,541 --> 00:17:29,750
they know if you farted in the front seat,
they know everything about these cars.

305
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:31,730
So pretty much when you
give them the vin number,

306
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:35,060
you know the cars are always connect it
back to the mothership to give you the

307
00:17:35,061 --> 00:17:38,420
status in the car so they know
what's going on. So you know,

308
00:17:38,421 --> 00:17:42,830
if you try to hide from you, just you
just can't do it. Um, so, so I had the,

309
00:17:42,831 --> 00:17:45,050
I had the car and I said to myself, you
know what? This isn't going to work.

310
00:17:45,051 --> 00:17:46,490
I got to figure something out.
So what I did,

311
00:17:46,491 --> 00:17:51,491
basically I bought another car
for 15 grand and I was like,

312
00:17:51,930 --> 00:17:53,190
I got to swap this stuff over.

313
00:17:53,220 --> 00:17:56,080
So I swapped every single one
that you bought for 15 grand.

314
00:17:56,081 --> 00:17:57,900
Everything worked well.
It was in a front end collision.

315
00:17:58,120 --> 00:18:01,560
It was in a hard friend and collision
and the frame's bent or something frame

316
00:18:01,561 --> 00:18:02,760
was bad.
The thing was toast.

317
00:18:02,790 --> 00:18:04,800
And I just took all the
electronics from one to the other.

318
00:18:04,830 --> 00:18:09,240
How do you check to make
sure that everything isn't
damaged when that's a good

319
00:18:09,241 --> 00:18:09,480
thing?

320
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:13,470
A lot of the wiring harnesses were cut
right in the front end collision car.

321
00:18:13,470 --> 00:18:16,230
But the interesting part
was that in the flooded car,

322
00:18:16,231 --> 00:18:20,280
the wiring harnesses that we're still good
for the most part in the front really.

323
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:24,150
So what I did was, I mean meaning not
broken or torn or have then connectors,

324
00:18:24,390 --> 00:18:27,750
I just took those connectors
off and actually cleaned
them because they couldn't

325
00:18:27,751 --> 00:18:29,370
get parts, you know, from Tesla.

326
00:18:29,610 --> 00:18:32,490
I took like the wet wiring harnesses
that we're all corroded, pulled them out,

327
00:18:32,980 --> 00:18:36,660
got like, you know, Qtip toothbrush and
all that stuff. But he cleaned them with,

328
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:39,240
so I cleaned them with um,
with baking,

329
00:18:39,241 --> 00:18:44,241
speaking soda and I'm like a wire
brush and like I got a toothpick to,

330
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:47,040
to really get in there and like
cleaning the contacts and stuff.

331
00:18:47,370 --> 00:18:50,970
I just rinsed them out with water. By this
time, your wife was probably like, what?

332
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,380
She's pissed, he'll fall. She goes,

333
00:18:52,381 --> 00:18:55,080
I noticed we're missing
$30,000 from my bank account

334
00:18:57,010 --> 00:19:00,480
and two cars that don't work exactly
to credit, don't work, you know,

335
00:19:00,481 --> 00:19:04,110
and there's a $30,000 a missing from our
bank account. Like, what's going on here.

336
00:19:04,140 --> 00:19:08,040
So, um, it was just, it was
painstaking, but eventually, you know,

337
00:19:08,041 --> 00:19:12,730
I got the job done then. So, so I
ended up doing was so 30 grand, right.

338
00:19:12,930 --> 00:19:14,430
I told my friends, hey listen, you know,

339
00:19:14,431 --> 00:19:16,710
I'm in a mess here and we're building
a test on it. Just like, you know,

340
00:19:16,711 --> 00:19:19,050
you're an idiot, you're not going to
figure this out. Like no one's doing that.

341
00:19:19,051 --> 00:19:20,790
Cause this was,
this was years ago,

342
00:19:21,210 --> 00:19:24,150
this is when the cars were still kind of
coming onto the scene and they weren't

343
00:19:24,151 --> 00:19:26,760
as popular as they are now. And
you're like, you can't fix that.

344
00:19:26,780 --> 00:19:29,730
Like you're an idiot. You can't
do that. I've seen your work. Uh,

345
00:19:31,650 --> 00:19:35,610
and uh, so yeah, so
after awhile, you know,

346
00:19:35,611 --> 00:19:38,460
I took all the parts from
one of the other, um,

347
00:19:39,150 --> 00:19:43,440
got one running and then the
parts I didn't need anymore,

348
00:19:43,770 --> 00:19:46,940
like the, the, the old battery
pack and some of the actions.

349
00:19:47,130 --> 00:19:50,250
So there were some parts of the
battery that we're still good.

350
00:19:50,580 --> 00:19:54,720
So I actually sold those parts like
online and on Ebay and stuff like that.

351
00:19:55,140 --> 00:19:58,320
And then I sold like the motor,
he had water in it.

352
00:19:58,321 --> 00:20:00,630
Someone got give me five grand
for motor that had water in it.

353
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:02,670
That's how valuable these parts are.
So mad.

354
00:20:02,790 --> 00:20:05,760
Was he planning on doing the same thing?
They're cleaning it out. I have no idea.

355
00:20:05,761 --> 00:20:08,580
To this day. I don't know. So I
think he has in the same situation.

356
00:20:08,581 --> 00:20:10,680
I think he brought it home to his
wife. He said, hey look what I got.

357
00:20:11,530 --> 00:20:15,300
It's probably still at his house.
And uh, so after all of that,

358
00:20:15,301 --> 00:20:19,080
so all the parts I ended up getting
the car I have now for about six grand.

359
00:20:20,130 --> 00:20:24,510
So you take the engine and is that
one of the four wheel drive ones?

360
00:20:24,510 --> 00:20:26,130
The ones you have.
This was just a rear wheel drive one.

361
00:20:26,490 --> 00:20:30,810
And so it has just the rear engine.
The single motor. Yep. One engine.

362
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:34,170
And so you take those out,
you put it all back in,

363
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:37,560
you replaced the wires and then it's
good to go. What about the computer?

364
00:20:37,561 --> 00:20:38,760
What about,
Gosh,

365
00:20:38,820 --> 00:20:43,260
so pretty much the computer thing
was interesting because there was,

366
00:20:43,261 --> 00:20:46,530
so I called Tesla again,
right? I was like, hey buddy,

367
00:20:46,830 --> 00:20:49,960
like this car is like 99% of
the way there. Do you know,

368
00:20:50,020 --> 00:20:53,290
do they know who you are at this point?
They still don't know who I am.

369
00:20:53,291 --> 00:20:55,870
Nor do they care. They still probably
don't care who I am, but, but did you say,

370
00:20:55,871 --> 00:20:58,750
hey man, you remember you
hung up on me? Yeah. Right.

371
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:02,670
The car still doesn't work.
Well, I still didn't work. Right.

372
00:21:02,671 --> 00:21:06,910
So the tough part was I
had to remember I had no,

373
00:21:07,390 --> 00:21:11,530
I had no key for the car. Oh. So
I was like, Hey, I need a key.

374
00:21:12,130 --> 00:21:15,340
You know what I mean? Like help me out
here. He a key. And they were like, well,

375
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:18,040
are you the same idiot that called like,
yeah, I need the key. They're like,

376
00:21:18,041 --> 00:21:22,090
we can't, as I stated before, we
can't help you because you know this.

377
00:21:22,091 --> 00:21:26,980
This is a salvage car, so you're on your
own. So what I did was I actually in the,

378
00:21:26,981 --> 00:21:30,960
in the GPS screen, because
the screen turned on the, the,

379
00:21:30,970 --> 00:21:35,320
the guy still had the home location.
So I pushed home on the gps screen,

380
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:40,030
found the guy's address, right.
This is creepy. I got, gets creepy,

381
00:21:40,630 --> 00:21:44,860
right? If I'm the guy's address.
And I was like, Hey, you know,

382
00:21:44,890 --> 00:21:47,620
can we, uh, I called
them up. I was like, hey,

383
00:21:47,621 --> 00:21:52,500
did you own like a white Tesla by
chance? And he's like, who was like,

384
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:57,400
yeah, I own one. I was like, yeah,
um, so I bought it and I need the key.

385
00:21:57,401 --> 00:22:01,420
Do you have the key to the
car? And he's like, no, I
don't, I don't have that. Like,

386
00:22:01,421 --> 00:22:03,310
what do you call me for like, I
don't understand. It's like, well,

387
00:22:03,311 --> 00:22:08,180
I'm rebuilding it, I'm putting
the electronics from your
condo or another. And, um,

388
00:22:08,380 --> 00:22:10,780
I want to figure it out. And he's
like, you know what, I can't help you.

389
00:22:10,781 --> 00:22:13,300
I don't have the key. And I
was like, damn, it's socks.
You know, cause you know,

390
00:22:13,810 --> 00:22:17,050
I have a family and stuff and you know,
kind of give him the sob story, like,

391
00:22:17,051 --> 00:22:20,360
you know, he could read it, look for
and help me out, be good. And, uh,

392
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:23,320
we started talking about general
topics and he's like, you know,

393
00:22:23,510 --> 00:22:26,590
I know you're a car guy.
That's awesome. Um, I had, uh,

394
00:22:26,650 --> 00:22:30,970
I had a zero six months and I was like,
Hey, I have a zero six two. And he's like,

395
00:22:30,971 --> 00:22:33,880
yeah, it was, it was Lamont's blue. And
I was like, Hey, mines the mines blue.

396
00:22:34,360 --> 00:22:37,120
And he's like, what year is it? I
was like, it's an o six. He goes,

397
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:41,830
I sold that same car or car like it
like two years ago to a guy in Florida.

398
00:22:41,831 --> 00:22:45,010
I was like, I bought the car from a
guy in Florida. So we started bonding.

399
00:22:45,011 --> 00:22:49,360
So it turns out I actually owned his
old zero six. Yeah, it's crazy, right?

400
00:22:49,390 --> 00:22:52,720
What are the odds of two human beings on
the planet? You own both of the scars.

401
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:56,530
Carlos's this guy's car. It was insane.
So he's like, listen, he goes, awesome.

402
00:22:56,531 --> 00:22:59,080
You know, I'll see if I could,
I'll see if I could find, you know,

403
00:22:59,081 --> 00:23:01,600
the key friends with that dude now.
No, we never talked again after that.

404
00:23:01,601 --> 00:23:05,690
He was like, you should be free. Well,
here's the reason why so. Well one on one,

405
00:23:05,710 --> 00:23:09,700
it was super creepy for me to call
the guy in number two. Um, when I,

406
00:23:10,550 --> 00:23:14,200
when I went kind of silent for a week,
he called me back and said, buddy,

407
00:23:14,201 --> 00:23:17,890
I found the key. Oh, I found the key
to the car. I was like, awesome dude.

408
00:23:17,950 --> 00:23:18,940
Like you're fantastic.

409
00:23:19,270 --> 00:23:22,660
I'm going to send you an envelope to
your address so you could kind of give me

410
00:23:22,661 --> 00:23:26,560
the key. And he's like, yeah, yeah. Great,
great, great. How about like 600 bucks?

411
00:23:26,810 --> 00:23:28,960
Oh, I know. I was like, Bro, Haim,

412
00:23:28,961 --> 00:23:30,880
we just bonded over the fact
that I own both of your cars.

413
00:23:30,881 --> 00:23:34,570
What are you doing to me here?
660 and remember like, you know,

414
00:23:34,571 --> 00:23:37,780
to a lot of people that's nothing but
like to me like I was trying to be cheap

415
00:23:37,781 --> 00:23:42,700
and scrappy. So tons of buses. 600 bucks.
Yeah, that's a bit much. A lot of money.

416
00:23:42,730 --> 00:23:46,130
And I was like, Hey, I
was like, you didn't,

417
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:49,730
the key didn't exist to you as
of a week ago, but now the are,

418
00:23:49,731 --> 00:23:50,870
you can make money from it.
Like,

419
00:23:50,871 --> 00:23:53,890
now you wanna charge 100 bucks and he's
just like, you know, Da da Da. She said,

420
00:23:53,900 --> 00:23:57,560
been talking again. And he goes,
how about 400 bucks? And I was like,

421
00:23:57,561 --> 00:23:59,480
you know what guys,
I'll just give you the money.

422
00:24:00,050 --> 00:24:04,550
Take the damn money and blood money.
Yeah, right. Exactly right. So I sold,

423
00:24:04,551 --> 00:24:08,890
I sold my soul pretty much. And he did.
Yeah, he's got that blood money. No,

424
00:24:08,891 --> 00:24:11,990
but I shouldn't have. I feel like
I was, I shouldn't have taken it.

425
00:24:12,020 --> 00:24:16,390
I would've rubbed that money on
my balls. Hello? Y'all go bro.

426
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:20,440
Make sure you sniff that hundred dollar
bill first. I mean, it's like I get,

427
00:24:20,460 --> 00:24:25,350
he's just being a dirt bag. Right? But no,
but after that you got the key and it's,

428
00:24:25,390 --> 00:24:28,390
it's, that's what it is. And then
the car's running and driving today.

429
00:24:28,430 --> 00:24:32,120
So as soon as you got the
key, you're good. Do you have
one key or two? Just one.

430
00:24:32,300 --> 00:24:37,220
Oh, if I lose that, I'm screwed. Can
you make a phone? We're like your APP.

431
00:24:37,250 --> 00:24:42,100
Does it work on the car? Nope. Damn. No,
that's big. The APP. That's huge. Yeah,

432
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:45,700
I always cool. Then you'll get the car to
come to you. You could sum it up. Yeah,

433
00:24:47,270 --> 00:24:51,460
he can park like, like literally within
an inch on each side. Right. That's the,

434
00:24:51,630 --> 00:24:53,930
that's the, that's the problem is that
I feel like with the, with the tasks,

435
00:24:53,931 --> 00:24:58,910
because I have a model x now, so I have
the SUV now and it's the ultimate flex.

436
00:24:59,150 --> 00:25:02,930
Tiffany Haddish had one and she had it
in the parking lot at the comedy store

437
00:25:02,931 --> 00:25:04,100
and she had it dancing.

438
00:25:04,190 --> 00:25:07,250
Really omen that door's kind of go
up and down and stuff to the music.

439
00:25:07,250 --> 00:25:10,550
It just out in front of the
car and her and I answered it.

440
00:25:10,551 --> 00:25:13,610
Everybody's dancing and they're
filming it. It was a hilarious moment.

441
00:25:13,611 --> 00:25:15,980
And it's funny cause I,
I found myself,

442
00:25:15,981 --> 00:25:18,320
I feel like this car has
ruined me as a person. Right.

443
00:25:18,321 --> 00:25:21,500
Like I'm at typically like pretty humble
person, but like having like a Tesla.

444
00:25:21,650 --> 00:25:24,470
The fact that you could push a
button and the car comes to you.

445
00:25:25,190 --> 00:25:27,640
It's like the biggest, like
it's, it's a douchebag. No.

446
00:25:27,641 --> 00:25:30,380
Because honestly we were doing,
we were like getting into our cars,

447
00:25:30,381 --> 00:25:32,420
like peasants for years,
you know,

448
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:36,800
and one thing was at the gym and I was
looking at my car from, you know, from a,

449
00:25:36,810 --> 00:25:38,540
you know, from a distance and
I was like, you know what?

450
00:25:39,170 --> 00:25:42,140
I really don't feel like walking
all the way to my car today.

451
00:25:42,500 --> 00:25:45,020
How far it was probably like
the distance from you to me.

452
00:25:45,020 --> 00:25:45,950
It wasn't really that far.
It's like,

453
00:25:45,951 --> 00:25:47,660
it was like the last thing between
us and I was like, you know what?

454
00:25:47,780 --> 00:25:50,750
Come to Daddy, come to Daddy, pushed
a button. The car just backed out.

455
00:25:50,751 --> 00:25:53,600
Everyone's like, Whoa, that car's driving
itself. I was like, yeah, that's me.

456
00:25:53,690 --> 00:25:56,810
Push the button, open the door,
got in. I just drove off. Yeah.

457
00:25:56,811 --> 00:26:00,350
When I take it and I put it in auto drive,
that's when it really freaks me out.

458
00:26:00,410 --> 00:26:04,850
Yeah. You use that often.
Doesn't scare me, Finn. Yeah,
it scares me. It scares me,

459
00:26:04,851 --> 00:26:08,000
but I keep my hands right there. But it
is freaky hasn't tried to kill you yet?

460
00:26:08,030 --> 00:26:12,520
No. Okay. This is becoming really,
I'm just joking. Just joking. No,

461
00:26:12,530 --> 00:26:15,180
it's like I'll just keep my hand there.
I always keep my hand there, but um,

462
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:16,273
I'm always,

463
00:26:16,680 --> 00:26:20,450
the one thing I'm concerned with is
that I think I'm lowering my guard. Yes,

464
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:24,140
absolutely. I'm letting the car I'll do
too much. Absolutely. When you drive,

465
00:26:24,141 --> 00:26:26,930
like one of the reasons for road
rage is when we're driving around,

466
00:26:27,140 --> 00:26:30,400
we don't know who the fuck's next to
us and we were going very fast and it

467
00:26:30,401 --> 00:26:32,240
requires the ability to
think really quickly.

468
00:26:32,241 --> 00:26:35,720
So your brain is in a heightened state
of awareness and then someone does

469
00:26:35,721 --> 00:26:40,160
something stupid like this
mother fucker. Right, exactly.

470
00:26:40,161 --> 00:26:45,000
That's where the rage comes from.
But it, it lightens that almost.

471
00:26:45,030 --> 00:26:46,140
Maybe too much.

472
00:26:46,230 --> 00:26:49,530
Cause I think you do need to be what
she's kind of turned into my lane. Right.

473
00:26:49,531 --> 00:26:53,610
I think you do need to be at least aware
that some shit can happen at any moment

474
00:26:53,611 --> 00:26:54,690
when cars are flying by,

475
00:26:54,691 --> 00:26:58,290
you go to 75 so you don't take your hands
fully off the car drive itself. Really?

476
00:26:58,370 --> 00:27:01,650
Yeah. I just put my hand on it. I don't
take my hands fully off. But if you do,

477
00:27:01,680 --> 00:27:03,670
you can only do it for so long.
And I'll start to warn them to complain.

478
00:27:03,671 --> 00:27:05,040
Complaint be like, Hey,
what's going on here buddy?

479
00:27:05,070 --> 00:27:08,040
But apparently some dudes tried.
They say that didn't work.

480
00:27:08,130 --> 00:27:10,800
I talked to one of those dudes
who did that, that experiment.

481
00:27:10,830 --> 00:27:15,750
Apparently that experiment
didn't, whatever orange. Yeah,
I think I might work man.

482
00:27:15,810 --> 00:27:20,160
I think what does work better is
like they said, I like a lightweight,

483
00:27:20,520 --> 00:27:21,960
like if you take like a,

484
00:27:22,020 --> 00:27:25,620
like a lightweight and put it on like a
rubber band and you hang it. There was,

485
00:27:25,660 --> 00:27:26,161
you know what's funny,

486
00:27:26,161 --> 00:27:29,760
there was a guy that was selling that you
hear about that he was selling like it

487
00:27:29,761 --> 00:27:31,380
looked like a,
uh,

488
00:27:31,430 --> 00:27:34,680
it was like a basically like a weight
that went around the steering wheel and it

489
00:27:34,681 --> 00:27:38,520
actually had the perfect amount of weight
balance and make you think that your

490
00:27:38,521 --> 00:27:42,110
hand was still on the wheel. People
were buying it. There it is. And Tesla,

491
00:27:42,130 --> 00:27:46,570
autoplay buddy. Hi Buddy. As Mag
relaunches has a phone mount. Yeah.

492
00:27:46,860 --> 00:27:48,810
So then so, so, so we had that right.

493
00:27:48,840 --> 00:27:53,420
He was selling it and it was like
300 bucks and then, you know,

494
00:27:53,490 --> 00:27:55,470
they were like, that's
illegal. You can't do that.

495
00:27:55,650 --> 00:27:57,840
You're bypassing like a
safety device of the car.

496
00:27:57,930 --> 00:28:00,780
So then what he did was he came back
again with a vengeance and made it a phone

497
00:28:00,781 --> 00:28:03,810
mount. He's clever. He's clever.
Yeah. Yeah. That's a smart move.

498
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:06,930
Although I'm not sure I support it. I
don't think I do either. That's kind of,

499
00:28:06,990 --> 00:28:10,770
that's a little bit much. Don't think
it's ready for that. Weirds me out.

500
00:28:10,860 --> 00:28:13,440
It weirds me out because the other
thing is the other people are,

501
00:28:13,441 --> 00:28:16,590
are not going with auto drive.
So you're around,

502
00:28:16,591 --> 00:28:19,640
you're going auto drive and all these
other people are just driving. Yeah.

503
00:28:19,680 --> 00:28:21,240
And I think when everyone's
driving together,

504
00:28:21,241 --> 00:28:22,380
you're kind of in tune with each other.

505
00:28:22,381 --> 00:28:24,400
All this hassle was trying
to go really fast. Right.

506
00:28:24,510 --> 00:28:26,370
Get the fuck over taking
this guy. Right. Yeah.

507
00:28:26,371 --> 00:28:28,500
Let me pass this gate you were
aware of when you're just,

508
00:28:28,530 --> 00:28:31,600
when you're auto driving, it's
like, you're like, like, uh,

509
00:28:31,710 --> 00:28:34,380
assist in this moving.
Yeah.

510
00:28:34,700 --> 00:28:37,500
That ecosystem thinking,
right.

511
00:28:37,530 --> 00:28:39,750
All these people be
calculating each other.

512
00:28:39,990 --> 00:28:42,600
But it's probably ultimately
like if you talk, talk to Ilan,

513
00:28:42,601 --> 00:28:44,850
he says it's way safer
and then it's the future.

514
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:48,060
I hundred percent agree with them.
Absolutely. Obviously hates fun. Yeah.

515
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:50,970
Cause what would you do that don't forget.
Right.

516
00:28:51,030 --> 00:28:54,420
Ilan could talk all this shit he wants.
Remember he had a Mclaren f one?

517
00:28:54,450 --> 00:28:58,470
Yes he did. And he still has a Jaguar
e type one of those really old ones.

518
00:28:58,471 --> 00:29:03,140
Like a 69 with the long Sharknado Long
Hood. Yep. Yeah. He's, he had a McLaren.

519
00:29:03,150 --> 00:29:05,790
So he at heart, he knows the
deal. You know what I mean?

520
00:29:05,791 --> 00:29:10,680
But he didn't make that car that fast for
a practicality. No, it makes no sense.

521
00:29:10,681 --> 00:29:13,950
It's the same reason he made a fucking
blow torch. Exactly. Right. Right.

522
00:29:13,951 --> 00:29:16,530
It's a silly person, I guess. Not a
flame thrower. We know that. It's not.

523
00:29:16,980 --> 00:29:20,070
Definitely not a flame thrower.
Silly. Super Genius. So it is,

524
00:29:20,100 --> 00:29:23,190
what do you think and all the best
ways. Yes. Right. Only good ways.

525
00:29:23,191 --> 00:29:27,570
I'd never say anything bad about him
of the guy. He's so glad he's alive.

526
00:29:28,260 --> 00:29:31,470
I am. I'm glad he's a real thing. No.
Honestly I and I understand degree.

527
00:29:31,471 --> 00:29:35,490
I get a lot of crap from people online
saying I come and Eli Musk hater.

528
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:38,400
I'm a Tesla hater. Cause I could be
critical sometimes. You know what I mean?

529
00:29:38,910 --> 00:29:41,980
But it's like the guys, the
guys a damn genius, but he's a

530
00:29:42,040 --> 00:29:45,850
damn genius. Damn genius. And critical is
important guys. Like you are important.

531
00:29:45,880 --> 00:29:49,060
It's very important to hear
what other people think.

532
00:29:49,061 --> 00:29:51,590
If it's rezoned an intelligent right.

533
00:29:51,640 --> 00:29:54,110
I get helps you even if you
don't like hearing it. All
right. So I've got to keep,

534
00:29:54,130 --> 00:29:57,580
I mean he's a genius, but sometimes
you got to keep the company in check.

535
00:29:57,581 --> 00:30:02,380
The cars are phenomenal cars.
They're phenomenal cars and
they weren't always, no,

536
00:30:02,470 --> 00:30:05,290
absolutely not. Yeah. And what they
were, when they first came out,

537
00:30:05,291 --> 00:30:09,940
like were you aware of the whole thing
with top gear? Yes. That was crazy. Yeah.

538
00:30:09,941 --> 00:30:12,070
They were being shady.
Yeah. Super Shady. Yeah,

539
00:30:12,071 --> 00:30:13,930
they were running the countdown car died.

540
00:30:13,931 --> 00:30:16,600
They want it to bash the car much as
they could. But like for stuff like that,

541
00:30:16,601 --> 00:30:19,180
like I'll stick up and say, Yo, hey,
you can't keep doing that. And He,

542
00:30:19,181 --> 00:30:22,210
when he got pissed, he loves it. That's
his baby. Yeah, he sues the baby.

543
00:30:22,211 --> 00:30:27,100
I think he lost because I think the way
there's show is structured that was,

544
00:30:27,130 --> 00:30:29,170
it's interesting,
it's entertainment.

545
00:30:29,920 --> 00:30:33,700
It's incredibly damaging to absolutely
company because it made it look like,

546
00:30:33,940 --> 00:30:35,440
I don't know why they did that.

547
00:30:35,620 --> 00:30:38,260
There's a couple of things that they
did the top gear did, but I was like,

548
00:30:38,261 --> 00:30:42,170
why would you do that? Right. But that
was a sound of, some people remember they,

549
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:46,070
their, their focus focuses on petrol
or gas powered cars. Like when a,

550
00:30:46,071 --> 00:30:49,450
when an eevee comes along
and it's actually pretty damn
good. And a lot of cases,

551
00:30:49,451 --> 00:30:51,700
people are just like, Shit,
you can't let this thing win.

552
00:30:51,850 --> 00:30:54,520
Especially back back in the
day when that was going on,

553
00:30:54,800 --> 00:30:58,660
and that was a long time ago. That
was in 2012 I think. Yeah. 2013 yeah.

554
00:30:58,840 --> 00:31:03,640
So you get the key from this guy's car,
right? You can't use the APP. Right.

555
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:07,660
So you, you have to rely on the
software and the state that it's at.

556
00:31:07,661 --> 00:31:11,110
There's no software updates. No. So
here's the, here's the long story.

557
00:31:11,260 --> 00:31:16,260
So get the cargo and everything's great
in order to get mask mask from the Tesla

558
00:31:17,591 --> 00:31:18,280
system.

559
00:31:18,280 --> 00:31:21,190
So there's a certain system that the
Tesla knows we're all their cars are and

560
00:31:21,191 --> 00:31:23,290
they could disable whatever they want.
They can do whatever they want.

561
00:31:23,291 --> 00:31:24,940
They see shut you down.
Exactly.

562
00:31:25,090 --> 00:31:29,830
So I had to reach out to like this Tesla
black hat hacker pretty much. Oh Jesus.

563
00:31:29,831 --> 00:31:33,640
He would go to the dark web.
I had to go to the deep dark web and um,

564
00:31:34,630 --> 00:31:37,180
and he was able to mask
tousle from seeing the car,

565
00:31:37,181 --> 00:31:40,630
which is why I can't have the
Tesla App. Oh. So he matched that.

566
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:44,070
So he got into the actual software
itself into the actual software itself.

567
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:48,160
Guy's a genius is Phil switched
one to zero. Exactly. Took the bit,

568
00:31:48,520 --> 00:31:50,890
and then it was able to be,
uh,

569
00:31:50,950 --> 00:31:53,780
the Cockettes supercharge the
car could do everything I can do.

570
00:31:53,950 --> 00:31:57,400
And the car gets updates too. It's great.
Oh, it does. It does get updates. Yeah.

571
00:31:57,730 --> 00:32:00,580
And Tesla doesn't know it's getting
updates. No. You know what's funny?

572
00:32:00,581 --> 00:32:04,010
You shouldn't say this. I'm just kidding.
Now they, they know the deal. And here's,

573
00:32:04,040 --> 00:32:08,920
here's a problem with that is that,
um, people love these cars a lot, man.

574
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:12,430
Yeah. I love these cars, you know, hence
me, I'm picking the car like a dirty lake,

575
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:15,730
you know what I mean? And fixing this
thing, you know what I mean? So it's,

576
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:20,840
it's a lot of the times it's in their
best interest I believe to help people out

577
00:32:20,981 --> 00:32:23,800
a little bit. Yeah. Um, but, but no,

578
00:32:23,801 --> 00:32:26,260
the things that people go through for
these cards is insane and people just,

579
00:32:26,261 --> 00:32:27,200
they just love them.
They're my,

580
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:32,400
my take on it is that what they have
is this ingenious company with this mad

581
00:32:32,891 --> 00:32:34,870
genius scientist who's running it,

582
00:32:34,900 --> 00:32:37,050
who does a million other
things at the same time. Right.

583
00:32:37,300 --> 00:32:42,290
And they don't have enough people
to deal with someone like you.

584
00:32:42,430 --> 00:32:43,161
They probably just don't,

585
00:32:43,161 --> 00:32:46,880
they don't have like a section of the
company to deal with someone like you.

586
00:32:46,881 --> 00:32:48,770
They, do you remember when
he was working, when he was,

587
00:32:48,830 --> 00:32:51,830
they were trying to put out the model
three and he was working 16 hours a day

588
00:32:51,831 --> 00:32:54,020
and sleeping on the floor of the category.
Pretty much.

589
00:32:54,021 --> 00:32:57,110
Shit that don't make any sense. Like
what the people know. It's funny people,

590
00:32:57,770 --> 00:33:00,970
it doesn't make any sense, but people
love the company. They love this guy. So,

591
00:33:00,971 --> 00:33:02,620
so Cigna that um,

592
00:33:02,810 --> 00:33:06,470
when he was working 16 hours a day and
he was sleeping on the floor in the

593
00:33:06,471 --> 00:33:08,780
factory, right? You know,
it was a big sob story,

594
00:33:08,781 --> 00:33:10,070
a billion to be on the full the factory.

595
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:15,590
A bunch of Tesla owners rallied together
and they purchased a couch for him to

596
00:33:15,591 --> 00:33:20,230
sleep on like tens of thousands
of dollars. What kind of couches?

597
00:33:20,231 --> 00:33:23,040
I must been a nice ass count.
Crazy. But either way, like they,

598
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:26,710
they rallied and they purchase a couch for
him. And like I made a video. I didn't,

599
00:33:26,711 --> 00:33:30,290
I said to myself, you know what?
This guy's a billionaire B.

600
00:33:30,710 --> 00:33:35,390
But the fact that everyone
rallied together to help
this guy to show that their

601
00:33:35,391 --> 00:33:39,130
support people are hands over fist
with his company, man, they are heels.

602
00:33:39,230 --> 00:33:43,040
It reminds me of apple back in the day.
You know,

603
00:33:43,130 --> 00:33:46,940
I remember there was a, God,
God bless his heart who uh,

604
00:33:46,941 --> 00:33:51,470
was one of the editors on news radio was
a sitcom that it was on in the 90s and

605
00:33:51,471 --> 00:33:55,120
he was such an apple head
that he was like, he,

606
00:33:55,250 --> 00:33:59,150
he was talking about it like
it was a sports team. He
was talking about it. Well,

607
00:33:59,151 --> 00:34:03,110
I think we're really going to get those
PC guys routine when the Mac books come

608
00:34:03,111 --> 00:34:07,610
out. I keep, but he really said
something to that all along those lines.

609
00:34:07,611 --> 00:34:12,250
I think we're really gonna
pull ahead. Like who's we?
We mean we're only doing me.

610
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:16,460
Yeah, they were on this weird little
tribe. Mac and this is the same thing,

611
00:34:16,461 --> 00:34:19,030
but you know what?
You don't picture the apple fanboys,

612
00:34:19,950 --> 00:34:24,620
the Tusla fanboys times 10 and they live
in it. It's like an apple. You live in,

613
00:34:24,890 --> 00:34:26,150
it's, you know, times 10.

614
00:34:26,151 --> 00:34:29,450
Because I've been at work because not
because apple has the technology aspect of

615
00:34:29,451 --> 00:34:32,720
it. Like it's great. You
know, android socks, I have
an apple phone. Okay, perfect.

616
00:34:32,721 --> 00:34:37,520
Perfect. But for Teslas, you're
talking about technology.
So you have a tech nerds,

617
00:34:37,790 --> 00:34:41,950
you're talking about sustainability
as well. For the green people, Green.

618
00:34:41,980 --> 00:34:46,970
So you have the tech and the green
people and once they joined forces the

619
00:34:46,971 --> 00:34:50,210
scariest force on the earth. Right. It
isn't like war, like guns and stuff.

620
00:34:50,420 --> 00:34:54,530
It's actually a Mac
owning Tesla vegan owner.

621
00:34:57,390 --> 00:34:58,340
That's the scariest thing in the way.

622
00:34:58,341 --> 00:35:00,740
It really is a scary thing in the world
because they'll tell you all about it at

623
00:35:00,741 --> 00:35:05,330
a party. Oh my God. It cornered, they
get corner. But like they, it and it's,

624
00:35:05,360 --> 00:35:08,000
and I've struggled with that a lot and
a lot of cases because whenever I say

625
00:35:08,001 --> 00:35:11,030
something remotely negative
about Tessa, like, Hey,

626
00:35:11,031 --> 00:35:13,640
I think Tesla could do a better job here.
They're just like,

627
00:35:13,820 --> 00:35:17,570
you're just a gas head. I know you own
a zero six you worked for big, what?

628
00:35:17,571 --> 00:35:20,930
Someone acuity working for big oil.
Oh, you do? Yeah. What do you do?

629
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:25,220
How do you work from the coil? What does
that mean? You work for big oil. Yeah.

630
00:35:25,221 --> 00:35:29,660
You A, you're a part of the
Illuminati. Yeah, pretty much.
That's like I just, yeah,

631
00:35:29,700 --> 00:35:32,450
she worked for big oil for big oil.
What does that mean?

632
00:35:32,451 --> 00:35:34,870
Does that mean how much could
they pay you to, first of all,

633
00:35:35,060 --> 00:35:36,500
before people would realize it,

634
00:35:36,501 --> 00:35:38,280
all of a sudden you're walking
around with like diamond

635
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:42,530
chain be moved to a giant mansion.
Right? He's still fixing cars.

636
00:35:43,220 --> 00:35:46,700
Do you have a big oil law? You know, I've
got another thing going on. Right, right.

637
00:35:46,860 --> 00:35:50,940
I'm making billions for big oil by, by
a gas car. Go to shell. Shell's Great.

638
00:35:50,941 --> 00:35:54,060
I don't understand how people think
that that whole shill thing works.

639
00:35:54,230 --> 00:35:57,120
Then you just get like a monthly check.
I don't understand. Like, hey rich,

640
00:35:57,121 --> 00:35:58,590
say something negative about tests.

641
00:35:58,591 --> 00:36:01,110
Every once in a while we'll give you a
check for 23 they get to get that big oil

642
00:36:01,111 --> 00:36:01,440
check.

643
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:05,280
I suspect that what it is is similar to
what my friend who was really addicted

644
00:36:05,281 --> 00:36:08,730
to apple. I think you just get on
your tribe and that's my thing.

645
00:36:08,731 --> 00:36:11,480
I'm all about apple and that's
your camp windows or it's bullshit.

646
00:36:11,500 --> 00:36:13,650
When does this bull shoe you want to play?

647
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:15,390
What are you going to fuck
with the config files?

648
00:36:16,140 --> 00:36:19,560
Get in there and then use dos and get
out of here. Yeah, you lose it a loser.

649
00:36:20,030 --> 00:36:23,790
But it's interesting cause people like
us are very different because we could

650
00:36:23,791 --> 00:36:28,120
appreciate both if you have a phenomenal
collection of cars. Thank you. And um,

651
00:36:28,170 --> 00:36:31,070
and then you, you threw a Tusla
in there, but you love both. Yeah.

652
00:36:31,100 --> 00:36:33,130
If you love the driving,
you'd left the driving aspect of it.

653
00:36:33,131 --> 00:36:36,900
You have your Porsche, you know, you love,
you know the, the, the silence and the,

654
00:36:36,901 --> 00:36:39,120
the zero to 60 of your Tesla too.
So like you could,

655
00:36:39,121 --> 00:36:43,050
we could be part of both camps, but a lot
of cases they're only, it's camp Tesla.

656
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:46,260
And if you're not with us,
you're against us. Silly. Yeah.

657
00:36:46,261 --> 00:36:50,190
I have a windows laptop and I have an
apple laptop. Oh you do? Yeah. Jeez.

658
00:36:50,250 --> 00:36:51,940
I both really, yeah. You know why?

659
00:36:52,140 --> 00:36:54,900
Cause windows has more options
and when you have more options,

660
00:36:54,901 --> 00:36:58,250
you get better configurations.
You get better keyboards. Like A,

661
00:36:58,260 --> 00:37:01,850
I have a Lenovo thinkpad. Oh look
at you dude. They're the shit. Yeah.

662
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:06,300
It's way better to write on like the
tactile feedback and the travel distance

663
00:37:06,301 --> 00:37:10,140
and the keys is so much longer. Right.
You just know where you're typing it.

664
00:37:10,260 --> 00:37:14,160
For me as a writer, when I'm writing, I'm
writing standard or something like that,

665
00:37:14,190 --> 00:37:17,610
it requires less thinking. Right. Cause
my fingers just find the keys easier.

666
00:37:17,611 --> 00:37:20,580
I mean like 10% plus easier.
It's a big deal.

667
00:37:21,050 --> 00:37:23,610
And I bought an older apple laptop too.

668
00:37:23,611 --> 00:37:27,900
I bought a 2015 a refurbished one cause
their keyboards were superior. Yes.

669
00:37:27,970 --> 00:37:31,020
The new ones are so low profile
the type, anything. Absolutely.

670
00:37:31,070 --> 00:37:34,920
It's the shittiest fucking keyboard
of any computer that you can buy.

671
00:37:34,921 --> 00:37:38,970
Today is a new Mac book pro and they
got busted for that because now because

672
00:37:38,971 --> 00:37:41,220
their keyboards are so shitty,
if it takes them back now,

673
00:37:41,610 --> 00:37:42,780
they didn't recalls in the keyboard.

674
00:37:42,780 --> 00:37:47,780
While they do have a new patent they
put out for a variable height keyboard

675
00:37:47,970 --> 00:37:52,740
where the key travel will vary and the
key resistance will. Very interesting.

676
00:37:52,741 --> 00:37:54,360
Yeah.
This is a new patent that they filed for.

677
00:37:54,361 --> 00:37:57,000
It doesn't necessarily mean they even
have the technology for it. Right.

678
00:37:57,180 --> 00:37:58,860
That sounds expensive.
I don't know why.

679
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:03,630
If it's something that you could press
a button that just raises the keys up,

680
00:38:03,660 --> 00:38:05,070
that would be like a solution.

681
00:38:05,071 --> 00:38:07,020
Because if you think about
the flatness of the key,

682
00:38:07,021 --> 00:38:10,500
the idea is they want to keep a low
profile to this laptop or and make it thin

683
00:38:10,501 --> 00:38:15,270
and sexy, which is like fucking whatever
the, I don't have the think pad with me,

684
00:38:15,271 --> 00:38:18,690
but I have a the x one carbon.
It's sad. Those are nice.

685
00:38:20,050 --> 00:38:22,860
Right? And the battery life is
excellent. Six months, dude.

686
00:38:23,420 --> 00:38:26,910
It's a fucking great laptop.
Right? So apple just,

687
00:38:26,911 --> 00:38:31,500
they're just only apple and the problem
with that one company only selling

688
00:38:31,501 --> 00:38:33,900
laptops is you just don't
have enough variety.

689
00:38:34,170 --> 00:38:36,910
There's not enough people that
are offering challenges to it.

690
00:38:37,030 --> 00:38:38,860
They don't have any challenges.
In fact,

691
00:38:38,861 --> 00:38:42,010
their biggest challenge
is the waterway mate book.

692
00:38:42,350 --> 00:38:47,160
Huawei basically stole their, their
idea and but made it way better. Right?

693
00:38:47,290 --> 00:38:50,470
They made, oh, I see what you guys
are doing. You guys are fucking up.

694
00:38:50,471 --> 00:38:53,110
We're going to be doing it the same way.
We're going to make it with better keys.

695
00:38:53,140 --> 00:38:55,240
Right? We're going to have no
bezels on the side of the screen.

696
00:38:55,420 --> 00:38:57,040
And you know everyone's
concerned about security.

697
00:38:57,041 --> 00:39:00,400
Well we're just going to have the Webcam
pop up as a key. Have you seen that? No,

698
00:39:00,401 --> 00:39:02,740
I have it. No Dope. That
sounds next level shit.

699
00:39:02,741 --> 00:39:06,460
I want to see why way am I saying that
right? That's it. Come on Bro. Oh Shit.

700
00:39:06,490 --> 00:39:09,760
That's dope as fuck. Look
no bezels. No bezels. No,

701
00:39:09,790 --> 00:39:13,840
no room for the Webcam and it
has great keyboard travel too.

702
00:39:13,841 --> 00:39:16,510
I think it's like 1.5
millimeter key travel,

703
00:39:16,660 --> 00:39:18,880
which is if you are a person
who writes all the time,

704
00:39:19,420 --> 00:39:23,380
I need to get my thoughts out. I'm
stupid. Do you write a lot? Write a lot.

705
00:39:23,470 --> 00:39:27,460
Stand up. And I just write things and
extract. Stand up from them and right,

706
00:39:27,970 --> 00:39:31,720
but when I write I want, I don't
need to be fucking with the keys man.

707
00:39:31,721 --> 00:39:34,240
So why do you use your Mac then you,
this is all these pros about the,

708
00:39:34,241 --> 00:39:36,730
about the PC.
But why do you have to have both?

709
00:39:37,180 --> 00:39:40,330
I use that when I travel cause I
don't write as much when I travel.

710
00:39:40,331 --> 00:39:44,140
But I like to watch movies. And you
looked at that pops up. How about that?

711
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:47,740
That's the f six gears. It looks right
up, you know son, that's pretty wild.

712
00:39:48,890 --> 00:39:51,220
But that's good because of
weird because it's a profile.

713
00:39:51,260 --> 00:39:53,520
But the biggest thing is like when you're,
you,

714
00:39:53,521 --> 00:39:57,080
you probably have like a Skype meetings
or whatever. Google hangouts. Uh,

715
00:39:57,130 --> 00:40:00,460
the worst thing in the world is like the
camera turning on automatically death.

716
00:40:00,461 --> 00:40:04,470
A lie right there. That image is a lie.
That is not what it was. No one. Yeah, no,

717
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:06,910
that's him the fuck out. It's impossible.
Even the right viewpoint. Yeah.

718
00:40:06,911 --> 00:40:09,610
That's ridiculous. No one's that good
looking either. She's pretty hot. Yeah.

719
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:15,170
Yeah. But it does pop up, man.
That's in state. So that's,

720
00:40:15,171 --> 00:40:18,280
that's a thing because it was just like
a Mac. Yup. It looks just like a Mac,

721
00:40:18,340 --> 00:40:20,200
except it is more key travel,

722
00:40:20,770 --> 00:40:23,830
more comfortable and that upper
right hand corner, that power.

723
00:40:23,831 --> 00:40:28,480
But he was also a fingerprint reader. Oh
fuck it. I'm going to buy one right now.

724
00:40:28,610 --> 00:40:32,380
They're the shit. I would, I would
use one. But you don't have one? No.

725
00:40:32,470 --> 00:40:36,760
When did I have? Oh yeah. Yeah. It's
great to never did. I mean, this is just,

726
00:40:36,840 --> 00:40:39,400
they're there. It's all
just better options. Right.

727
00:40:39,401 --> 00:40:43,780
The only difference is windows is not as
good as macro s but it's not that much

728
00:40:43,781 --> 00:40:46,540
worse. No, it's really not.
It's pretty fucking close.

729
00:40:46,550 --> 00:40:48,970
Windows 10 is pretty fucking good.
And see what this run,

730
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:51,970
what does it run on windows? There's
some windows. Windows, windows, windows,

731
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:55,630
windows 10 yeah. She was not android.
No, that's a good one. That day. Right?

732
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:59,590
It would have to be one of
those Chromebooks. Right.
It was going to run android,

733
00:40:59,830 --> 00:41:02,870
which apparently is very good tone. Book
designs are really nice too. Very nice.

734
00:41:03,170 --> 00:41:05,020
Nice. And you can get
one super cheap. Right.

735
00:41:05,050 --> 00:41:07,090
And the battery lasts like three months.
That's forever.

736
00:41:07,180 --> 00:41:08,590
And if you just putting documents,

737
00:41:08,591 --> 00:41:10,390
he put them into your
Google docs in the cloud,

738
00:41:10,391 --> 00:41:13,440
you pull it up instantaneously
drive. No, it's great. Yeah. But why?

739
00:41:13,441 --> 00:41:16,170
Why is a weird company man like I
don't know what I feel about, I'm,

740
00:41:16,180 --> 00:41:20,140
I'm buying into all this government
propaganda about the Chinese spying on us.

741
00:41:20,170 --> 00:41:23,470
Yeah. It's definitely spying
on your fat. Well Dude,

742
00:41:23,471 --> 00:41:27,760
I've had my credit card stolen. My number
stolen three times this year. Why? How?

743
00:41:28,220 --> 00:41:30,790
It's never happened to me. Yeah. Well I
think, I think the more money you have,

744
00:41:30,791 --> 00:41:33,620
the more stuff you could still
maybe, yeah, maybe people find out.

745
00:41:34,490 --> 00:41:36,710
It's annoying though.
Like I got a charge,

746
00:41:36,860 --> 00:41:39,680
but I have an app on my phone that
shows me the charge and it was during a

747
00:41:39,681 --> 00:41:42,240
podcast while I'm like, well that
definitely wasn't me. Yeah, no,

748
00:41:42,270 --> 00:41:46,430
definitely was they get you with like
$10 one. So cool. $3, $10 a test.

749
00:41:46,431 --> 00:41:47,890
The waters to start.

750
00:41:47,900 --> 00:41:51,920
Quad microphones accurately pick up sound
from four meters away with the wall.

751
00:41:51,921 --> 00:41:56,290
Wait, what is that really spying on you?
But yeah, they did it. What? They're not,

752
00:41:56,510 --> 00:41:58,880
what they're not telling you is that
the microphones are always active.

753
00:41:58,900 --> 00:42:01,840
I was this dog. Yeah. Just like your
phone. They're always listening again.

754
00:42:02,010 --> 00:42:06,680
The government bro Translate Multiple Epp
people. Oh, great. Microsoft translator.

755
00:42:06,830 --> 00:42:08,610
You hear about the new TVs,
you hear about the, uh, the,

756
00:42:08,850 --> 00:42:12,890
the LG TVs that was spying on constantly
listening conversation. Wonderful.

757
00:42:12,920 --> 00:42:16,370
And they told you if you want to have
a private, confidential conversation,

758
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:18,320
don't have it in front of the TV
who they were basically saying,

759
00:42:19,090 --> 00:42:22,430
what if you're bring your wife in front
of the TV? That's interesting. Yeah.

760
00:42:22,520 --> 00:42:25,240
Does it have cameras on them?
Yeah, they have a camera.

761
00:42:25,380 --> 00:42:28,760
I think it live streams that I think
it's like a sex mode. After a while.

762
00:42:28,761 --> 00:42:31,220
Everyone's just going to watch
everybody do everything. I really,

763
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:34,040
I really think within a hundred
years that's going to be the case.

764
00:42:34,160 --> 00:42:37,370
That's the case now, man. I think it's
going to bloggers and like, you know, I'm,

765
00:42:37,371 --> 00:42:40,460
I'm on, I'm on Youtube. You know how that
goes and everyone wants to see what, Oh,

766
00:42:40,461 --> 00:42:42,890
what are you doing now? What are you
doing now? I didn't get a video last week.

767
00:42:42,891 --> 00:42:46,140
What's going on? What are you doing
now? Yeah. You know, it's, it's,

768
00:42:46,760 --> 00:42:50,390
but what we accept is way different
than what our parents accepted or would

769
00:42:50,391 --> 00:42:51,230
their parents accepted.

770
00:42:51,410 --> 00:42:53,990
And I think what our children except is
going to be weighing different and then

771
00:42:53,991 --> 00:42:56,420
what their children, except it's
going to be, we're like two,

772
00:42:56,421 --> 00:42:59,300
three generations from it just being
ridiculous where there's no privacy.

773
00:42:59,330 --> 00:43:02,210
How do you distance yourself because
you're a public figure, right?

774
00:43:02,540 --> 00:43:05,960
How do you distance yourself? Like
where do you draw the line for privacy?

775
00:43:06,290 --> 00:43:09,050
I guess you could say the real
problem was when you're eating man,

776
00:43:09,051 --> 00:43:11,570
when people like come up
to you while you have,

777
00:43:11,650 --> 00:43:16,190
like I'll have a kid in my lap and I'll
be eating food and talking to the kid

778
00:43:16,191 --> 00:43:20,490
and someone will literally come up to
me and tried to take a picture of me,

779
00:43:20,510 --> 00:43:22,430
asked me to take a picture
with me. I'm like, come on man,

780
00:43:22,760 --> 00:43:26,570
we're all out eating at a restaurant.
Like this is like, you know, just say hi.

781
00:43:26,860 --> 00:43:29,780
Just say hi man. And I always tell
people when I'm done and I'm leaving,

782
00:43:29,781 --> 00:43:33,350
I'll take a picture with you. But you
can't, you can't just interrupt dinner.

783
00:43:33,490 --> 00:43:35,000
That's insane.
But it's just,

784
00:43:35,120 --> 00:43:38,120
it's just people think like if they
don't get a picture with you right now,

785
00:43:38,150 --> 00:43:40,820
you can get it right now. Now, now,
now fucking don't care. I'm going in.

786
00:43:40,821 --> 00:43:44,750
I'm an average cook. Right. And they don't
care. I mean, and then they'll say, hey,

787
00:43:44,870 --> 00:43:47,930
that's the price you pay for being famous.
Well now it's like, no, come on guys.

788
00:43:48,310 --> 00:43:50,690
That's, it's crazy. Like this is the deal.

789
00:43:50,691 --> 00:43:53,540
The deal is some provides
something that you enjoy,

790
00:43:53,541 --> 00:43:57,800
whether it's stand up or a thing
and I appreciate that you enjoy it,

791
00:43:58,160 --> 00:44:01,460
but that's our exchange. All
the other stuff. Anything else?

792
00:44:02,060 --> 00:44:05,300
Meeting me at a restaurant and shit
when a, when I'm eating with my kid,

793
00:44:05,630 --> 00:44:08,960
like come on man. That's the, you're
asking for too much. This is a ridiculous,

794
00:44:08,961 --> 00:44:09,681
here's another question for you.

795
00:44:09,681 --> 00:44:12,860
What kind of restaurants you eat at
where people feel need to come up?

796
00:44:12,861 --> 00:44:16,780
Td at like a high end, right? Like apple
bees and stuff or like no Wednesday

797
00:44:18,880 --> 00:44:22,590
math. Right. Mostly places.
Normal normal spots. It's not,

798
00:44:22,610 --> 00:44:25,670
it's not normal that someone does that.
Most people were super respectful,

799
00:44:25,880 --> 00:44:28,880
but all it takes is one out of a
hundred and then it just gets weird.

800
00:44:29,750 --> 00:44:32,370
And most people don't.
Most people are cool,

801
00:44:32,371 --> 00:44:35,850
but it's every now and then people just
have this idea that somehow or another

802
00:44:35,851 --> 00:44:39,280
you have to, if you are a famous person,
you have to abandon everything, right?

803
00:44:39,920 --> 00:44:42,930
Just to Pr. That's the other thing that
you're not a person anymore, right?

804
00:44:42,931 --> 00:44:47,130
You're like a famous person. Like it's
like the regular rules don't apply to him.

805
00:44:47,131 --> 00:44:48,090
Someone don't apply.

806
00:44:48,450 --> 00:44:52,560
Like you would never just barge in on
a regular person that you did. No, no.

807
00:44:52,620 --> 00:44:55,610
But if it's a regular famous person,
people, they don't give a fuck off.

808
00:44:55,611 --> 00:44:58,690
This is fine. Whatever. Right? Where your,

809
00:44:58,860 --> 00:45:01,650
you and your friend are both crying
and talk about someone who died.

810
00:45:01,950 --> 00:45:05,430
You don't give a fuck. Hey Man, I'm sorry
to interrupt bro. But I get that picture,

811
00:45:06,470 --> 00:45:08,200
Bro. Damn. Can I get that picture, Bro?

812
00:45:08,220 --> 00:45:10,860
So what's the weirdest interaction
you've had with someone?

813
00:45:10,940 --> 00:45:12,330
It's mostly just that kind of stuff.

814
00:45:13,210 --> 00:45:15,930
You're the shit is like people that
tell me that they're going to give me

815
00:45:15,931 --> 00:45:20,610
secrets like Ufo type stuff, big
foot. And I know where the bases are.

816
00:45:20,611 --> 00:45:22,740
Like really those
motherfuckers. Yes. Ghettos.

817
00:45:23,160 --> 00:45:25,760
I've had a few of those restaurants
just walking on the street.

818
00:45:26,180 --> 00:45:29,400
Usually a comedy shows. Yeah.
Yeah. Usually a comedy shows.

819
00:45:29,430 --> 00:45:31,690
Do you ever walk down the street?
That's what weird thing I just asked you.

820
00:45:31,860 --> 00:45:34,760
I mean, cause like when you're always
either driving, you're going somewhere.

821
00:45:34,770 --> 00:45:38,700
You ever go for a casual walk around
at well I do. I walked my dog. Right.

822
00:45:39,230 --> 00:45:42,510
But yeah, I don't walk
around La. Nobody does.

823
00:45:42,810 --> 00:45:47,250
Nobody walks in pockets of walking
in La. So time out. Real quick,

824
00:45:47,630 --> 00:45:52,250
real quick. Quick story with time with
rich. So I landed right. And you know,

825
00:45:52,350 --> 00:45:57,150
you know Boston and the deal in Boston.
Yeah. Uh, so I landed and you know, I uh,

826
00:45:57,151 --> 00:46:00,390
a buddy of mine picked me up from the
airport and I got to where I was staying

827
00:46:00,391 --> 00:46:03,060
on staying in the mission district.
Look at all the sudden, first of all,

828
00:46:03,090 --> 00:46:06,540
it was freaking great. The Sun was
awesome. Right. I was looking at, my gosh,

829
00:46:06,541 --> 00:46:11,541
Sung gray skies and then I looked down
literally homeless people everywhere and

830
00:46:13,110 --> 00:46:14,760
what is going on with that?
Like it just,

831
00:46:14,790 --> 00:46:18,270
it blew my mind because it literally,

832
00:46:18,520 --> 00:46:20,860
so I went to the gym in
the morning and I was like,

833
00:46:20,861 --> 00:46:25,861
it was like at 7:00 AM and I saw probably
just as many homeless people living in

834
00:46:26,041 --> 00:46:30,310
tents next to buildings as there
were people commuting to work. Yeah,

835
00:46:30,530 --> 00:46:35,130
like thousand. Oh yeah. It's,
it's amazing. Have you been
in skid row yet? No. God,

836
00:46:35,150 --> 00:46:36,450
I'm scared.
You got to go.

837
00:46:36,480 --> 00:46:38,460
You should go while you're here
because it's like the Grand Canyon,

838
00:46:38,860 --> 00:46:41,190
like the Grand Canyon of homeless people.
Why would I want to go there?

839
00:46:41,520 --> 00:46:43,800
Because it's just, you can't
believe that. It's like,

840
00:46:44,040 --> 00:46:47,370
did you watch the battle of
Winterfell game of Thrones? No.

841
00:46:47,400 --> 00:46:50,010
Don't tell no spoilers. No,
I won't give any spoilers.

842
00:46:50,430 --> 00:46:53,790
I'll have to have come with a better.
Okay. Here's a better analogy.

843
00:46:53,970 --> 00:46:56,460
Did you ever see a I am legend.
Okay.

844
00:46:56,550 --> 00:46:59,850
Remember when all the fucking crazy
Zombie people running at once. Yeah.

845
00:46:59,910 --> 00:47:02,250
That's what it's like. Are
you serious? I'm telling you,

846
00:47:02,251 --> 00:47:05,490
you can't believe the volume
doesn't someone even like,
because in Boston, listen,

847
00:47:06,700 --> 00:47:10,890
I'm a freeze to death and
die. Yeah, exactly. So No,

848
00:47:11,250 --> 00:47:15,510
in Boston we, we hide our homeless
people. We have like shelters and stuff,

849
00:47:15,660 --> 00:47:18,660
we hide them for the most part, you know,
downtown crossing area, parks sheet,

850
00:47:18,661 --> 00:47:21,810
whatever. They like the junkies that
like have that, the whole gangster lean,

851
00:47:21,811 --> 00:47:25,170
they just lean, close their eyes and they
must fight. Right. And then we, you know,

852
00:47:25,171 --> 00:47:26,970
it gets cold, they scattered.
I don't know where they go,

853
00:47:26,971 --> 00:47:29,170
but you don't really see them that
much. You know, I'm not being rude.

854
00:47:29,171 --> 00:47:31,720
Like I don't mind her saying it's great,
but like in say,

855
00:47:31,721 --> 00:47:34,060
but they're in your face,
man. Like you, I've,

856
00:47:34,600 --> 00:47:39,400
if San Francisco is the craziest,
it's, it was insane. So like, honestly,

857
00:47:39,570 --> 00:47:43,000
and then one of my friends, he said,
listen, you know, I'm coming to my house,

858
00:47:43,210 --> 00:47:45,580
you know, whatever. We're going to hang
out for a beer at school. No problem.

859
00:47:45,730 --> 00:47:49,090
Went to his house like a small place,
not batting a thousand square feet.

860
00:47:50,170 --> 00:47:52,540
I'm like, pretty nice. He goes,
yeah, you know, I'm Kinda, you know,

861
00:47:53,050 --> 00:47:55,210
things are a little tough. Can I,
you know, can I borrow some, uh,

862
00:47:55,211 --> 00:47:56,530
some money was like borrow money from me,

863
00:47:56,531 --> 00:47:59,680
but he talking about do this is you
live in, you know, you're doing okay.

864
00:48:00,100 --> 00:48:02,140
He's like, yeah, we're living
paycheck to paycheck. I was like,

865
00:48:02,141 --> 00:48:05,290
what are we talking about? I'm like,
this is a, this is like a, you know,

866
00:48:05,350 --> 00:48:06,250
you had a decent place.

867
00:48:06,580 --> 00:48:11,580
The house we were in was a one point $6
million house and it was this big and

868
00:48:14,140 --> 00:48:19,120
I'm like San Francisco, so stupid
is expensive man. And said, listen,

869
00:48:19,121 --> 00:48:23,320
Hey, come to my house, you know, and I
pull up to the house. It's a warehouse.

870
00:48:23,770 --> 00:48:27,070
Like they live in a warehouse that's
actually cool. You can live like blade.

871
00:48:27,340 --> 00:48:32,270
It's snipes lives with Kris
Kristofferson. It's, yeah,

872
00:48:32,320 --> 00:48:35,410
you're right. You're right. He had the
motorcycle, he had the fucking charger,

873
00:48:35,770 --> 00:48:38,890
dodge charger. But it sounds cool when
you have kids living in a warehouse.

874
00:48:39,120 --> 00:48:41,770
Isn't that great?
So that's the thing is that like,

875
00:48:41,870 --> 00:48:45,970
it's a common thing I've noticed for
people to live in either abandoned

876
00:48:45,971 --> 00:48:49,720
buildings, warehouses
and cars. Yeah. You know,

877
00:48:49,750 --> 00:48:53,350
people that live in cars and the amount
of smashed windows that I've seen here,

878
00:48:53,720 --> 00:48:55,900
it's, I couldn't believe it. Well,

879
00:48:55,901 --> 00:48:58,420
most of those people live in cars
are actually stand up comedians.

880
00:49:01,090 --> 00:49:05,290
Everybody has a fucking story.
Like so many comics come
here and before, you know,

881
00:49:05,291 --> 00:49:08,640
when they first settled in,
they live in the car. That's
super normal. Yeah. That's,

882
00:49:08,650 --> 00:49:10,200
that's it. Just crazy. Like models.

883
00:49:10,220 --> 00:49:13,120
10 of my friends really lived in
their car and go to live in cars.

884
00:49:13,360 --> 00:49:16,710
They're used to at least and then
got an apartment, bigger car. Uh,

885
00:49:17,360 --> 00:49:18,910
that's an issue we're having around here.

886
00:49:19,180 --> 00:49:21,430
We're having around here with
these people that live in caravans.

887
00:49:21,460 --> 00:49:24,640
They live in these mobile home things.
I've seen the mass, there's like,

888
00:49:24,730 --> 00:49:26,530
if you drive around this community,

889
00:49:26,720 --> 00:49:31,170
go down certain streets and you just
see these massive caravans. Yeah.

890
00:49:31,180 --> 00:49:35,450
And they have like, like towels over the
windows. And I saw the math and science.

891
00:49:35,490 --> 00:49:39,610
Yeah, yeah, yeah. These are
dirge people. Some of these
fuckers, I don't. So how come?

892
00:49:39,611 --> 00:49:42,690
So again, in Boston we just
kind of say, hey, you got this.

893
00:49:42,700 --> 00:49:46,570
No likely in a loitering where they're
kicking people out now because businesses

894
00:49:46,571 --> 00:49:47,201
are complaining.

895
00:49:47,201 --> 00:49:51,160
Because there was one business where
this guy had parked his caravan right in

896
00:49:51,161 --> 00:49:51,700
front of it.

897
00:49:51,700 --> 00:49:56,700
That's where a buddy of mine works and
this dude had laid out is like a blanket

898
00:49:58,391 --> 00:50:01,870
on their front lawn and was sunning
himself. One of his caravan,

899
00:50:02,360 --> 00:50:05,350
the front of his building
became this guy's lawn.

900
00:50:06,100 --> 00:50:10,960
So this guy in this caravan was literally
using the, that we're sharing grass,

901
00:50:10,980 --> 00:50:14,260
right? So he's got this multimillion
dollar building and he's sharing it with a

902
00:50:14,261 --> 00:50:17,470
homeless guy who's cooking meth
or I don't know if it's math,

903
00:50:17,471 --> 00:50:22,471
but some white noxious
smoke that comes out place.

904
00:50:23,550 --> 00:50:26,890
I couldn't. So it, it's, it was
different for me. The weather is awesome,

905
00:50:26,891 --> 00:50:28,130
but like that was a big thing.
And I feel

906
00:50:28,130 --> 00:50:31,760
like as I'm walking around more,
if I see a large standing body of water,

907
00:50:31,790 --> 00:50:33,590
I'm like there's a homeless
guy live in there too,

908
00:50:33,591 --> 00:50:35,090
that people just everywhere
they're everywhere.

909
00:50:35,180 --> 00:50:38,840
I'm telling you what you saw is nothing.
When you got to go to skid row,

910
00:50:38,870 --> 00:50:42,720
it's what is, this is a skid row, skid
row. This is Google maps. It's good real.

911
00:50:42,721 --> 00:50:47,380
I just started snooping around. They
must've cleaned it up right before. Yeah,

912
00:50:47,410 --> 00:50:51,130
yeah, yeah. Let me know. Shit,
that ain't shit. Let me tell
you something, man. It's,

913
00:50:51,140 --> 00:50:54,500
look at that. Look at all that to the
right and to the left. It's fucking gross.

914
00:50:54,660 --> 00:50:57,650
So how do people have businesses there?
They don't or they just deal with it.

915
00:50:57,651 --> 00:50:58,850
They just deal with it.
Most of them,

916
00:50:58,880 --> 00:51:02,090
most of those people that just put
all like gates and locks and shit.

917
00:51:02,660 --> 00:51:07,320
What's on skid row? It's can you where
you just were Jamie? We just were,

918
00:51:07,430 --> 00:51:10,730
um, well it's a lot of
warehouses and shit and,

919
00:51:10,731 --> 00:51:14,210
but the interesting thing is this
area is getting air quotes gentrified.

920
00:51:14,570 --> 00:51:18,020
So this where a lot of
businesses are going now.

921
00:51:18,021 --> 00:51:22,400
They're opening up apartment buildings
and a buddy of mine has lived there.

922
00:51:22,430 --> 00:51:25,640
My friend Magnus Magnus Walker,
he's a famous car guy too.

923
00:51:25,641 --> 00:51:26,480
I don't know if you know who he is.

924
00:51:26,481 --> 00:51:29,690
He's got all these videos of
Porsche's or he rebuilt old Porsches.

925
00:51:29,870 --> 00:51:33,440
He's got this crazy dreadlocks
and beard and crazy Englishman,

926
00:51:33,441 --> 00:51:36,620
but he's been living down there
forever. He, and he has a,

927
00:51:36,621 --> 00:51:40,790
this warehouse where he has it set up
where, you know his living spaces, one,

928
00:51:40,820 --> 00:51:43,940
one part of the warehouse and then
down below Jase these cars. Right?

929
00:51:44,450 --> 00:51:45,290
And he has it all set up.

930
00:51:45,291 --> 00:51:49,820
But if you drive down some of these roads,

931
00:51:50,090 --> 00:51:53,450
you'll see like the super expensive
apartment buildings that are going up now.

932
00:51:53,690 --> 00:51:55,610
And then a block over,

933
00:51:55,640 --> 00:51:58,880
you'll see these homeless encampments
and people think it's like cute to be

934
00:51:58,881 --> 00:52:03,140
around like all this dirt. What does this,
there we go. Nice. Look, now look at that.

935
00:52:03,141 --> 00:52:07,280
So that's someone's apartment. It's going
on here? Yeah, they're just set up tents.

936
00:52:07,370 --> 00:52:10,280
And then the cops kicked them out and
they just come back and they move and then

937
00:52:10,281 --> 00:52:14,750
they come back. But they, they make
these encampments and you just,

938
00:52:14,751 --> 00:52:18,380
you just have to deal with it. So it's
like if you live in that area, you know,

939
00:52:18,381 --> 00:52:20,660
you just have to jump over needles
and try to figure your way.

940
00:52:21,830 --> 00:52:25,130
I felt so I feel terrible because
no, it's, it's most of this.

941
00:52:25,370 --> 00:52:28,580
Most of this is either drug addiction
or mental illness. Those are the real,

942
00:52:28,610 --> 00:52:29,580
real problem.
All right.

943
00:52:29,660 --> 00:52:32,960
Do you guys have no drug addiction or
mental illness like places that you could

944
00:52:32,961 --> 00:52:36,260
go to for help here? I don't know what
it is, man. I don't know enough about it.

945
00:52:37,730 --> 00:52:40,360
Entirely ignorant about
how what's going on.

946
00:52:40,370 --> 00:52:43,310
I know that if you talk to people that
work in the field that work with these

947
00:52:43,311 --> 00:52:46,910
folks, they say that it all really started
to happen. Look at this guy. He's like,

948
00:52:46,911 --> 00:52:50,870
run over my leg. Oh my gosh. And I
need disability. Oh my goodness man.

949
00:52:50,871 --> 00:52:54,920
That's crazy. Crazy there on the
street. This is like, honestly,

950
00:52:54,921 --> 00:52:57,890
if you were to take a screenshot, what
you just showed me, I'd be like, okay,

951
00:52:57,891 --> 00:53:00,410
that's some third world country.
This is la.

952
00:53:00,470 --> 00:53:02,450
People can't even afford to live in La.
I know.

953
00:53:02,451 --> 00:53:04,340
I might as well be a third
world country though.

954
00:53:04,370 --> 00:53:07,700
I mean it might as well be the apocalypse.
It's the apocalypse for those folks.

955
00:53:08,210 --> 00:53:10,610
I mean at least there they're
around all these cars and shit,

956
00:53:10,611 --> 00:53:15,020
but I mean there are thousands of homeless
people and that whole skid row area

957
00:53:15,140 --> 00:53:17,430
right next to the mission there.
Yes. That's one of the reasons.

958
00:53:17,450 --> 00:53:20,330
One of the things that keeps them
there, I guess. Mission beds,

959
00:53:20,600 --> 00:53:23,000
three beds and the whole thing.
I don't know. That's wild.

960
00:53:23,050 --> 00:53:26,040
Now they'll allow most of this to

961
00:53:26,040 --> 00:53:29,280
go on. I don't know. Like how often
they break it up and make people move,

962
00:53:29,281 --> 00:53:33,180
but this did not, the numbers are so
high. There's not much they can do. Man.

963
00:53:33,270 --> 00:53:36,810
That's crazy. It's sad, sad.
It's Super Sad. But what do
you do? How do you fix that?

964
00:53:36,840 --> 00:53:40,280
Like I don't have any solution. I mean
you can't tell people they shouldn't.

965
00:53:40,290 --> 00:53:44,200
We do it. What does that say? Documentary.
Remember documentary? Yeah. Yeah. Pros.

966
00:53:44,201 --> 00:53:49,201
And then went and spent three days down
there like undercover and filming him,

967
00:53:49,440 --> 00:53:52,050
experiencing it and then he'd come back
and do like an interview or like what

968
00:53:52,080 --> 00:53:56,610
you just went through and it's, it came
out 10 years ago. So it's, it's different.

969
00:53:56,640 --> 00:54:00,570
I don't know if I'm, I'm assuming it's
worse now, but it's definitely not good.

970
00:54:00,571 --> 00:54:05,130
And this and this, so many. It's crazy.
So, uh, I, I was in my one wheel, right?

971
00:54:05,790 --> 00:54:08,770
Just rec riding by, I was commuting
back and by the way, the thing is bad.

972
00:54:08,920 --> 00:54:12,590
It's pretty crazy, right? Yeah. I've wrote
it. I wrote yours today. He did ride mine.

973
00:54:12,600 --> 00:54:15,690
It was good. And after watching you
scoot around effortlessly, I was like,

974
00:54:15,691 --> 00:54:17,910
how hard could it be? Do you
need one? You should get one.

975
00:54:18,540 --> 00:54:22,800
I also don't need broken
elbows like Odyssey. It's good
for, it's good. It's good.

976
00:54:22,801 --> 00:54:25,760
It's a good core workout. It's
a great word. You sit ups,

977
00:54:25,800 --> 00:54:27,090
I think it's a better core workout,

978
00:54:27,810 --> 00:54:31,680
but sit up and she'll show you this hip
and gluten machine from rogue where you

979
00:54:31,681 --> 00:54:33,990
put your ankles in this thing
and you lean all the way back.

980
00:54:33,991 --> 00:54:36,540
And go all the way up to then you have
some next level shit here by the way.

981
00:54:36,570 --> 00:54:40,110
Thank you. Some cool stuff, man. That's
awesome man. Warehouse. It's really,

982
00:54:40,111 --> 00:54:43,080
it's this place is fucked. Can I live
here? Sure. Alright, cool. Plenty of room.

983
00:54:44,720 --> 00:54:49,590
Bring it. 10 kept out of the
Jitsu bats. Um, but, but yeah,

984
00:54:49,591 --> 00:54:54,060
so I was right. My one wheel,
uh, pass this, uh, past like
this is kind of overpass.

985
00:54:54,390 --> 00:54:56,540
And uh,
there was a tent there and like a,

986
00:54:56,541 --> 00:55:00,900
a lady sticks her hand out and
she offers me a chocolate. Uh,

987
00:55:01,260 --> 00:55:04,350
what was it? I think it was a,
a chocolate lady bug, right?

988
00:55:04,380 --> 00:55:05,970
It was a lady bug wrapped
in like that, that, that,

989
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:08,820
that tin chocolate whenever I'm like,
oh. I'm like, no thank you. No thank you.

990
00:55:09,150 --> 00:55:11,550
Right back again. The next day offered
to me again. I was like, no thank you.

991
00:55:11,551 --> 00:55:13,500
No thank you. I was like, you know what?
I'm going to, I'm going to like, you know,

992
00:55:13,590 --> 00:55:18,140
do something nice. Right? So I get
five bucks and I was like, I'll go,

993
00:55:18,141 --> 00:55:22,500
I'll give it to her. You know, it's
a nice gesture. I write up, you know,

994
00:55:22,590 --> 00:55:26,940
I give her a hand to the five bucks. Uh,
as I start slowing down the one wheel,

995
00:55:27,930 --> 00:55:32,730
other people started popping their heads
out of the tents and they actually saw

996
00:55:34,050 --> 00:55:39,050
me give her the money and immediately
a guy runs out and like snatches it

997
00:55:39,721 --> 00:55:42,630
directly out of our hand,
snatched it right at hand.

998
00:55:42,720 --> 00:55:45,510
Someone else comes around the corner,
takes it from him,

999
00:55:45,511 --> 00:55:48,780
and they start getting into the scuffle.
And I'm just like,

1000
00:55:49,890 --> 00:55:51,600
I've never seen anything like that before.

1001
00:55:51,601 --> 00:55:53,730
I know I'm really passionate
about that. I just, it's just,

1002
00:55:54,090 --> 00:55:57,060
I just can't stop thinking about it. It's
crazy. It's really crazy out here, man.

1003
00:55:57,570 --> 00:56:01,770
It's crazy. And everyone comes,
everyone comes to to, to La,

1004
00:56:02,760 --> 00:56:04,960
California to get their big
break. Like, Oh, I'll let him,

1005
00:56:04,961 --> 00:56:08,120
I'm going to be like a famous whatever
famous, you know, actor, a singer,

1006
00:56:08,490 --> 00:56:12,900
exotic dancer, a porn star, whatever.
And it's, the struggle is real out here.

1007
00:56:13,230 --> 00:56:17,220
It's real. It's real everywhere. But when
whenever you get giant groups of people,

1008
00:56:17,310 --> 00:56:18,570
you're going to get,
you know,

1009
00:56:18,690 --> 00:56:22,050
a higher percentage of people that are
out here that are homeless or struggling.

1010
00:56:22,080 --> 00:56:24,190
Right. Um, again, I don't know

1011
00:56:24,190 --> 00:56:27,230
what the fuck. Oh, well what's
the solution? Yeah, no idea.

1012
00:56:27,940 --> 00:56:30,630
I know they don't put enough effort
into it and then just whatever,

1013
00:56:30,700 --> 00:56:31,840
whatever the solution is.

1014
00:56:32,110 --> 00:56:37,000
That's one of the arguments that who
was it someone made? Was it Cher?

1015
00:56:37,360 --> 00:56:40,900
Someone unlikely had a really
good argument like that.

1016
00:56:40,901 --> 00:56:45,190
Everybody is so concerned about illegal
aliens getting into this country and so

1017
00:56:45,191 --> 00:56:49,030
not concerned about our homeless problem.
Right. And what the fuck is that about?

1018
00:56:49,031 --> 00:56:53,050
Like there's people right here right
now and neither were not taken care of.

1019
00:56:53,051 --> 00:56:55,630
Right. And you're like, but these people
from other countries, they're trying to,

1020
00:56:55,670 --> 00:56:59,320
oh,
but which I might take on that though is,

1021
00:56:59,321 --> 00:57:02,410
but those people were trying to do
better. They just got fucked. Right.

1022
00:57:02,440 --> 00:57:07,110
Where's the other people live in America.
Okay. That's too many events. It's share.

1023
00:57:07,111 --> 00:57:07,944
Look at her.
Yeah.

1024
00:57:08,140 --> 00:57:12,910
That's what happens when old ladies still
look that good time, Bro. This year.

1025
00:57:13,330 --> 00:57:17,320
She's 12
she went back in time.

1026
00:57:18,070 --> 00:57:21,420
If my state kit, first of all,
this is my problem, right?

1027
00:57:21,520 --> 00:57:25,060
Why is this bitch capitalizing
every word? Oh, that's frustrating.

1028
00:57:26,020 --> 00:57:26,620
Oh my God.

1029
00:57:26,620 --> 00:57:30,940
She's capitalizing all of them and then
afterwards she's capitalizing those

1030
00:57:30,970 --> 00:57:31,803
letters.

1031
00:57:32,050 --> 00:57:37,050
If capital m y capital s t
a t like someone to write
this for her on her safety.

1032
00:57:38,370 --> 00:57:40,600
Must be, she's got an assistant.
She's got an assist him.

1033
00:57:40,601 --> 00:57:43,250
He hates her and she's like, I'm a subtly
going to make this pitch looks too,

1034
00:57:45,490 --> 00:57:49,810
I'm tired of her fake pictures and
their Photoshop filters. Fuck you share.

1035
00:57:49,840 --> 00:57:51,980
Can we, Hey, can we just for the
hell that can we find like a,

1036
00:57:51,990 --> 00:57:54,100
a recent photo of share?
Like how old is share?

1037
00:57:54,101 --> 00:57:59,101
Actually 750 I would say she's
65 how old do you think she is?

1038
00:58:00,221 --> 00:58:01,960
We'll take guest share homes.
How old are you?

1039
00:58:03,280 --> 00:58:08,280
60 [inaudible] 72 damn.

1040
00:58:09,540 --> 00:58:14,380
She about to turn 73 and was serious
when I was a kid. Well, it makes sense,

1041
00:58:14,530 --> 00:58:19,450
man. I'm 51 she does. I was a kid
like 20 years ago or yesterday.

1042
00:58:19,451 --> 00:58:24,160
You asshole way. You're, you're, is that,

1043
00:58:24,161 --> 00:58:27,640
what is that what money does? That's a
vampire facial. That's what money does.

1044
00:58:27,641 --> 00:58:30,670
I got to get some money. Yeah, you got to
get that money. The money gets you good.

1045
00:58:30,671 --> 00:58:34,930
Google search pictures.
All the keys. Oh Wow.

1046
00:58:35,650 --> 00:58:40,060
That's legit. But that's what they
sound like when they get to that age.

1047
00:58:40,061 --> 00:58:43,930
They start talking crazy. Sent her real
hair. Oh, 100% yeah. She bought it.

1048
00:58:44,050 --> 00:58:48,990
She bought, she owns it. She does own
that here. Yes. Good man. She's good.

1049
00:58:49,210 --> 00:58:52,480
She looks good. She married.
You want to know? I do not.

1050
00:58:52,481 --> 00:58:54,170
I don't know why I asked that.
That was a, we have enough.

1051
00:58:54,171 --> 00:58:58,330
That's what the movie is like, you know,
really get her to sign. No prenup. Right.

1052
00:58:58,480 --> 00:59:01,990
How much time Shan Ching,
Cha Ching. I mean if you can
hang in there for 20 years,

1053
00:59:02,050 --> 00:59:05,990
what are the odds that she can too?
I got wait it out.

1054
00:59:06,680 --> 00:59:11,410
Wait it out man. That's awful for her.
This is announcing our tour this year.

1055
00:59:11,411 --> 00:59:13,440
This picture photo.
Yeah.

1056
00:59:13,450 --> 00:59:17,640
Fuck it is that people use my
old pictures from my Twitter.

1057
00:59:17,670 --> 00:59:22,010
I don't even ask them
to do. Just if you find

1058
00:59:22,010 --> 00:59:23,600
that picture of me against a brick wall.

1059
00:59:23,601 --> 00:59:26,270
We took that shit back in the old studio.
That picture was like four years old.

1060
00:59:28,040 --> 00:59:31,310
Yeah. She's um, she's on tour.
Congratulations. Good for her.

1061
00:59:31,400 --> 00:59:34,150
We were talking about vampire
facials that some ladies, uh,

1062
00:59:34,220 --> 00:59:39,010
Jeff told us this lady, two people
got HIV and AIDS, right? Yeah.

1063
00:59:39,080 --> 00:59:41,220
Not necessarily eight. Sorry.
I jumped the gun. I know.

1064
00:59:41,360 --> 00:59:45,330
I jumped the gun and it's more fun to say
I have an HIV I apologize for with HIV.

1065
00:59:45,490 --> 00:59:46,390
I get this right now.
It's like,

1066
00:59:46,391 --> 00:59:49,760
he feels like you're not even supposed
to say aids. Like you can't say age.

1067
00:59:49,761 --> 00:59:51,300
Like whoa, whoa. Sensitive.

1068
00:59:51,310 --> 00:59:56,310
So down brother to test positive after
vampire facial says vampire facial is

1069
00:59:57,291 --> 01:00:01,690
girls get jabbed in the face
with some zip plasmas it.

1070
01:00:01,800 --> 01:00:06,270
What does it PRP, what do, what are they
doing? Didn't, didn't have that. Yeah,

1071
01:00:07,440 --> 01:00:11,510
yeah, yeah, yeah. She took pictures of
it on the INSTA. I don't understand.

1072
01:00:12,530 --> 01:00:15,950
Wait a minute. Don't they get a new
needle every time he used the same needle?

1073
01:00:16,070 --> 01:00:20,650
I don't want not hair. No. If there
you, there's Kim. Beautiful. Oh my God.

1074
01:00:21,030 --> 01:00:22,040
Awesome.
Um,

1075
01:00:23,070 --> 01:00:27,070
I don't know if they use other
people's blood for the facial watch.

1076
01:00:27,800 --> 01:00:29,570
Yeah,
I think that's probably what's going on.

1077
01:00:29,630 --> 01:00:31,220
I don't think instead it's a used needle.

1078
01:00:31,250 --> 01:00:33,830
I think it's that they're using
someone else's blood. Why would you,

1079
01:00:34,130 --> 01:00:37,370
this doesn't make any sense. It's like,
does this make sense to anyone? No,

1080
01:00:37,371 --> 01:00:40,700
because I would think that
that if you drew blood,

1081
01:00:40,850 --> 01:00:45,710
you would draw it from yourself.
It takes it from your body,

1082
01:00:46,190 --> 01:00:48,120
puts it in a centrifuge
and then put the right.

1083
01:00:48,180 --> 01:00:52,040
So that is basically platelet
rich plasma. So, but why,

1084
01:00:52,160 --> 01:00:55,600
why would anybody get HIV unless you're
giving it to yourself? Maybe they,

1085
01:00:56,450 --> 01:01:00,860
maybe they already had HIV banner lion
myth busted blaming it on Mexico wows per

1086
01:01:00,861 --> 01:01:05,000
usual. What did, why did she
do it? Her notes. She did it
on every part of her body.

1087
01:01:05,001 --> 01:01:09,920
But her nose. Yeah. She's scared of her
nose. She knows to look old plastic. Ah,

1088
01:01:10,010 --> 01:01:12,290
just kidding. Just kidding. Camp. You
will watch this. I'm just kidding.

1089
01:01:12,380 --> 01:01:16,910
Just kidding. Lol. Yeah. So what
happened to these fucking people?

1090
01:01:16,911 --> 01:01:18,290
Did they really use an old needle?

1091
01:01:18,980 --> 01:01:21,260
That doesn't mean they probably
already had aids. That's what it is.

1092
01:01:21,570 --> 01:01:23,210
God Damn Liar.
Because think about it for a second.

1093
01:01:23,270 --> 01:01:27,500
Why would you take an AIDS test before?
You know, Ooh, we're getting deep.

1094
01:01:27,530 --> 01:01:31,200
I took an ace test before and after my
facial and then I didn't even have a,

1095
01:01:31,201 --> 01:01:35,240
it's till after my facial.
Congratulations. Right? Yeah.
It doesn't make any sense.

1096
01:01:35,690 --> 01:01:38,060
That's like a, the Indian, uh, footage,

1097
01:01:38,090 --> 01:01:43,090
they found footprints of what they think
is big foot in India and people saying,

1098
01:01:43,941 --> 01:01:48,230
Hey asshole, this is an animal hopping.
Yeah. This thing's only got one leg.

1099
01:01:48,231 --> 01:01:50,310
If there's a big foot, it's
a one legged, big foot.

1100
01:01:50,311 --> 01:01:54,380
Like some doctor Seuss creature like
that. They're like, look stupid.

1101
01:01:54,381 --> 01:01:57,650
That's not two feet. It's not bipedal.
What do you guys do? Look at that.

1102
01:01:57,830 --> 01:02:00,500
That's one leg. Look at
that boring, boring bunk.

1103
01:02:00,520 --> 01:02:02,720
That's an animal jumping you assholes.

1104
01:02:03,580 --> 01:02:07,520
The thick part is where their butland's
the front part of their paws. Right?

1105
01:02:07,550 --> 01:02:10,760
Just keep going. See, you see one
of them. It's even broken up. Like,

1106
01:02:10,761 --> 01:02:14,450
look at that one picture where like
one of those footprints is actually two

1107
01:02:14,451 --> 01:02:18,410
separate marks in the, in the snow.
I'm not even a wildlife biologist.

1108
01:02:18,411 --> 01:02:22,620
The one right there, I'm not
even a wildlife biologist.
Rabbit Bro. It's a rabbit.

1109
01:02:23,010 --> 01:02:25,950
Those are kind of big be a rabbit body,
rabbit,

1110
01:02:27,720 --> 01:02:29,740
rabbit. There's some big ass
rabbits. How big the router,

1111
01:02:29,830 --> 01:02:32,490
Himalayas duty were scenes. I don't
know. That's what I'm wondering.

1112
01:02:32,491 --> 01:02:35,670
She a question to Himalayas, like what
would it be? What? What is your animal?

1113
01:02:35,671 --> 01:02:36,540
It could be,
well,

1114
01:02:36,541 --> 01:02:39,750
one of the things this is very interesting
about animals is that when they go

1115
01:02:39,751 --> 01:02:42,990
further north,
contrary to logic,

1116
01:02:43,150 --> 01:02:46,320
like what you would think they actually
get larger, you would think, well,

1117
01:02:46,360 --> 01:02:49,050
it's colder up there. They probably
get a small little thicker, but no,

1118
01:02:49,070 --> 01:02:52,290
they preserve their body temperature,
but being larger,

1119
01:02:52,600 --> 01:02:55,410
that's why Moose are so big.
They're the furthest north, uh,

1120
01:02:55,411 --> 01:02:58,590
of all the cows make sense to me.
Totally makes sense.

1121
01:02:58,890 --> 01:03:03,250
If you get a deer from Mexico,
they're tiny. They're like
a hundred pounds, right?

1122
01:03:03,330 --> 01:03:06,600
There's a deal, dear called the
coups deer and a really big one.

1123
01:03:06,601 --> 01:03:10,810
It's a hundred cows or coups depending
on who you ask. C O u s but it's a,

1124
01:03:10,950 --> 01:03:13,680
a variation of the whitetail
deer that's really small.

1125
01:03:13,890 --> 01:03:17,100
It only weighs like 100 pounds and it's
in Mexico full grown one. It's like a,

1126
01:03:17,160 --> 01:03:21,330
like a dog size. And then there's other
ones that are in like Saskatchewan,

1127
01:03:21,360 --> 01:03:25,550
that same species that are 300 pounds.
How do you know so much about deers?

1128
01:03:26,130 --> 01:03:28,810
Because I killed them all. Your
a Ha, I forgot you were out.

1129
01:03:28,820 --> 01:03:33,210
That explains the giant bowl outside.
Yeah. That's how I get my meat.

1130
01:03:33,870 --> 01:03:34,703
Nups please.
You know what?

1131
01:03:34,730 --> 01:03:37,530
A supermarket like everyone else
had to go to supermarket. But most,

1132
01:03:37,590 --> 01:03:40,260
most of the meat that I eat,
I try to eat from animals that I kill.

1133
01:03:40,290 --> 01:03:44,750
Where do you hunt? In La? No, La is
tricky. The tents get in the way.

1134
01:03:44,900 --> 01:03:47,470
Your Line of sight,
the lineup,

1135
01:03:48,180 --> 01:03:51,450
but you can get a lot of coyote hunting
in La if you want this fucking coyote

1136
01:03:51,480 --> 01:03:54,480
everywhere out here, man. What
you eat a coyote from la? Uh,

1137
01:03:54,481 --> 01:03:58,920
I don't think I'd eat a coyote period.
Right? Yeah. Unless there was a goof.

1138
01:03:59,450 --> 01:04:04,260
Uh, or I was really hungry.
You can eat them though. I
mean you can, it's just meat.

1139
01:04:04,630 --> 01:04:09,180
Yeah. You'd have to cook it really, really
well, but when you cut away all the,

1140
01:04:09,181 --> 01:04:13,530
the fur and mange and all the shit on
the outside left, just get a tissue.

1141
01:04:13,680 --> 01:04:14,220
Where do you,
uh,

1142
01:04:14,220 --> 01:04:19,220
where do you hunt typically the mountains
usually every year I go to Utah in the

1143
01:04:20,311 --> 01:04:24,750
mountains of Utah. What do you got
Jimmy further explanation on this.

1144
01:04:25,140 --> 01:04:26,830
Oh, it's a bear. Okay.

1145
01:04:26,831 --> 01:04:30,830
They call Yeti something different about
Himalayan Brown bear or a Tibetan blue

1146
01:04:30,831 --> 01:04:33,300
bear. Oh, what they call
with all due respect,

1147
01:04:33,301 --> 01:04:38,220
but we call Yeti is with all probability.
The either,

1148
01:04:38,310 --> 01:04:41,670
oh, no, no, no. Okay. Then it's not like
they called the Himalayan bear a Yeti.

1149
01:04:41,960 --> 01:04:44,490
It's like they're saying
that it was probably a bear
that was making those marks.

1150
01:04:44,670 --> 01:04:45,480
That makes sense.

1151
01:04:45,480 --> 01:04:47,940
If those are big marks that the
bear was hopping through the snow,

1152
01:04:47,941 --> 01:04:50,610
if it's thick snow, that's
a, that makes sense.

1153
01:04:50,611 --> 01:04:53,460
That Guy [inaudible] he's a nice guy.
With all due respect to everyone.

1154
01:04:53,510 --> 01:04:58,320
[inaudible] signal footprints or when
the bear walks on four feet. Yeah,

1155
01:04:58,800 --> 01:05:03,400
that makes sense. All right. Yeah, so
yeah, so as you go to Utah and you just,

1156
01:05:03,510 --> 01:05:06,840
you just wait, well there's
a lot of hiking, you know,

1157
01:05:06,900 --> 01:05:11,460
you go and you essentially you go where
you know that the elk are going to be in

1158
01:05:11,461 --> 01:05:14,340
the area and when they're in the Rut,
which is that when you hunt,

1159
01:05:14,490 --> 01:05:15,420
that's when it's legal,

1160
01:05:15,570 --> 01:05:18,580
which means they're their mating and
breeding and smashing heads together and

1161
01:05:19,030 --> 01:05:20,050
then you hear them,

1162
01:05:20,110 --> 01:05:22,930
you hear them scream at each other
and you're ready to be killed. Well,

1163
01:05:23,230 --> 01:05:26,260
they are definitely ready to
build them a little. Do they know?

1164
01:05:26,740 --> 01:05:28,480
Then you've got to figure
out how to sneak in on them,

1165
01:05:28,550 --> 01:05:29,920
but they can't help themselves.
They just,

1166
01:05:29,921 --> 01:05:33,700
they're competing with all these other
males screaming at each other and

1167
01:05:33,701 --> 01:05:37,150
smashing heads and occasionally you'll
find one that's dead that was killed by

1168
01:05:37,151 --> 01:05:40,540
another bull. But you don't eat that.
No, no, no, no. You could, I mean,

1169
01:05:40,541 --> 01:05:43,840
you certainly could if it was
like a recent kill, if you knew,

1170
01:05:43,960 --> 01:05:45,880
if you got to it like
right when it was dying,

1171
01:05:45,881 --> 01:05:48,400
it was the chair of the blood
was still coming out of its body.

1172
01:05:48,401 --> 01:05:52,880
But you will find them. They get stabbed
and they, they kill each other. Yeah.

1173
01:05:52,881 --> 01:05:55,840
That mean that's the whole reason
why those antlers exist for war.

1174
01:05:56,500 --> 01:05:57,580
They just fuck each other up.

1175
01:05:57,581 --> 01:06:00,580
They don't even use it to defend against
the other animals like wolves and shit.

1176
01:06:00,840 --> 01:06:03,160
They kicked the wolves most of the time.
So where do you,

1177
01:06:03,190 --> 01:06:06,640
how do you get the thing back?
Those things don't, aren't
light. Yeah, you have to,

1178
01:06:06,670 --> 01:06:08,500
uh, you have to do what's
called quartering it,

1179
01:06:08,650 --> 01:06:13,180
which is you take the legs off and you
take the front legs off and then you take

1180
01:06:13,181 --> 01:06:18,181
the meat off the carcass and then you
take the heart and the liver and the,

1181
01:06:18,260 --> 01:06:21,970
the edible organs and you have
to pack it out. So you have a,

1182
01:06:22,210 --> 01:06:25,210
you have a crew that goes with Iui or
is it just you with a big ass knife?

1183
01:06:25,510 --> 01:06:29,320
I bought. I'm not very
good at hunting. I'm like,

1184
01:06:29,380 --> 01:06:32,320
if hunting was a a martial art,
I'd be a blue belt.

1185
01:06:32,550 --> 01:06:36,460
Blue Bell is like your white belt, blue
belt, purple belt, Brown belt. Black Belt,

1186
01:06:36,490 --> 01:06:38,650
right? Oh, it's not a black
belt. I'm like a blue belt.

1187
01:06:38,650 --> 01:06:41,380
Maybe I could get my purple belt
if I look work real hard this year,

1188
01:06:41,800 --> 01:06:46,210
but I go with a guide who's going to take
me to the places that I need to go and

1189
01:06:46,211 --> 01:06:50,320
show me and a guy who is an experience
outdoorsman who basically teaches you.

1190
01:06:50,500 --> 01:06:54,760
It's like having a trainer in martial
arts. Exactly. It shows you, yeah, he's,

1191
01:06:54,761 --> 01:06:58,670
he knows the landscape is
a hardened outdoorsmen.

1192
01:06:58,930 --> 01:07:03,640
These guys never get fucking tired and
they'll go and take you and show you like

1193
01:07:03,850 --> 01:07:07,180
it, but then it's, it's your
job to execute the shot.

1194
01:07:07,181 --> 01:07:10,300
Your job to get close your job,
to stock in your job,

1195
01:07:10,301 --> 01:07:13,420
to make sure that you don't get what's
called winded means the animal smells you.

1196
01:07:13,421 --> 01:07:16,090
The wind's at your back and the wind
carries her sent towards the animal.

1197
01:07:16,210 --> 01:07:19,280
So you have to move around of thought
that goes into this. A lot of thoughts.

1198
01:07:20,870 --> 01:07:25,310
I don't use a gun. I used to be, oh, I'm
going to have used a gun. I have. Really?

1199
01:07:25,420 --> 01:07:28,390
Yeah. I shot a bow on it and it didn't
go so well. It just Kinda, it's fun.

1200
01:07:29,010 --> 01:07:33,250
Both just shooting targets is really fun.
It's very cathartic.

1201
01:07:33,280 --> 01:07:34,270
It says there's like something,

1202
01:07:34,271 --> 01:07:37,850
there's a release when that Arrow finds
his target just feels really good. Yeah,

1203
01:07:38,350 --> 01:07:41,860
it's probably some primitive shit from
back when we used to rely on killing

1204
01:07:41,861 --> 01:07:44,350
things with those scenarios
that like accuracy.

1205
01:07:44,380 --> 01:07:46,910
But there's something about
hitting something with a, uh,

1206
01:07:47,140 --> 01:07:49,960
like when you shooting something
at a target and hits it, it's very,

1207
01:07:49,961 --> 01:07:53,170
very satisfying. Rewarding. Yeah. And
when you do that with a bow and Arrow,

1208
01:07:53,171 --> 01:07:56,190
it's very difficult. It's more
challenging. It's more rewarding. Yeah.

1209
01:07:56,230 --> 01:07:58,930
I've never used a traditional,
but I mean I have like a couple of times,

1210
01:07:58,931 --> 01:08:02,520
but I've never really tried to shoot
with like a traditional bow or a gun.

1211
01:08:02,530 --> 01:08:06,400
But they also like that. No, no,
I have, uh, you draw it. I mean,

1212
01:08:06,401 --> 01:08:08,110
you would have to pull it back,
but it's a compound bow.

1213
01:08:08,111 --> 01:08:12,910
It relies on these mechanical,
uh, these gears that these, um,

1214
01:08:13,180 --> 01:08:14,140
what do they call camps?

1215
01:08:14,170 --> 01:08:16,880
It's like the Boeing walking dead and
we watched the one that's a crossbow.

1216
01:08:16,881 --> 01:08:19,850
The crossbow. Yeah. That's,
that's a bullshit though with
that is, is a shitty gun.

1217
01:08:19,880 --> 01:08:23,050
Okay. So this guy's got a trigger.
Any, well, let us zombies.

1218
01:08:23,840 --> 01:08:27,470
It would make me very angry. Very
frustrated. Okay. First of all,

1219
01:08:27,471 --> 01:08:29,730
it doesn't even have a broadhead
on that stupid thing. Right?

1220
01:08:29,810 --> 01:08:32,270
He's shooting them with a little pencil
holes and it's killing him instantly.

1221
01:08:32,550 --> 01:08:36,650
That's all. That's all he had
access to make a broad head makeup.

1222
01:08:36,651 --> 01:08:40,880
Brought him out to do that break into
a bass pro shop, have some projects,

1223
01:08:41,410 --> 01:08:44,660
you know? Yeah man, man, she did see
a few bass pro shops and walking dead.

1224
01:08:44,690 --> 01:08:49,690
They just walk right past their
brothers and nets and the kayaks.

1225
01:08:50,450 --> 01:08:54,500
Um, so that's a crossbow. And there's
a, that's a very controversial, uh,

1226
01:08:54,501 --> 01:08:56,930
weapon amongst outdoorsmen.
Why is that?

1227
01:08:56,931 --> 01:09:00,360
Because they use those during bow season.
Okay.

1228
01:09:00,410 --> 01:09:02,500
And there's a reason
why bow season like the,

1229
01:09:03,440 --> 01:09:06,620
if you looked at like
statistics across the board,

1230
01:09:07,310 --> 01:09:10,640
if you have a what's called a tag,
like say if you wanted to go deer hunting,

1231
01:09:10,641 --> 01:09:13,190
you'd have to get a license and then
you'd get a tag and if the tag was

1232
01:09:13,191 --> 01:09:16,670
available for the area, you wanted you
to pay a certain amount for that tag.

1233
01:09:17,150 --> 01:09:19,700
Now if you get a boat tag,
they,

1234
01:09:20,030 --> 01:09:23,750
they make the bow season earlier,
you have a higher,

1235
01:09:23,751 --> 01:09:28,370
a much higher likelihood of failure
with a bow than you do with a gun.

1236
01:09:28,580 --> 01:09:33,080
So I could say like 50% of the people that
got a tag, it's usually not that high.

1237
01:09:33,081 --> 01:09:37,160
But if 50% of the people that got
a tag for rifle were successful,

1238
01:09:37,280 --> 01:09:39,890
it might be 10% with a boat,
it might be even less.

1239
01:09:39,980 --> 01:09:43,700
It might be even less than some places,
depending on how rugged the landscape is,

1240
01:09:43,701 --> 01:09:45,530
how hard it is to get to
where the animals are.

1241
01:09:45,770 --> 01:09:48,240
And you have to be able to
shoot far accurately. Right.

1242
01:09:48,290 --> 01:09:50,180
So do you do most of the shooting
when you go up there? Do you have

1243
01:09:51,880 --> 01:09:56,360
I shoot them myself. Yeah. Yeah. That's
a man. That's a manly asking to do it.

1244
01:09:56,790 --> 01:09:59,660
Well, you're going to do a
lot of manly shit. I noticed.

1245
01:09:59,780 --> 01:10:02,750
I know I'm probably compensating for
something. I didn't want to say that,

1246
01:10:02,751 --> 01:10:05,930
but yeah, it's funny cause
inevitable. But like you do a lot of,

1247
01:10:06,380 --> 01:10:09,140
I noticed that it whole MMA stand up
making everyone laugh and then yeah,

1248
01:10:09,260 --> 01:10:11,570
I didn't know you were, you hunted
as well. You know what it is, man.

1249
01:10:11,600 --> 01:10:13,730
I don't have anybody
telling me what to do.

1250
01:10:13,820 --> 01:10:15,500
So because I don't have
anybody telling me what to do,

1251
01:10:15,501 --> 01:10:18,890
I gravitate towards things that I'm really
interested, which is why you're here.

1252
01:10:18,950 --> 01:10:22,460
Right. You know what I'm saying? I mean
I found out about your story. I was like,

1253
01:10:22,490 --> 01:10:25,100
that guy seems cool. And then I started
youtube videos like, oh, he's cool.

1254
01:10:25,101 --> 01:10:27,860
All right, let's do this.
Yeah. I mean that's like,

1255
01:10:27,861 --> 01:10:31,490
to have that kind of freedom in
your life is a beautiful thing.

1256
01:10:31,491 --> 01:10:35,270
And I feel incredibly fortunate
that I have that kind of freedom.

1257
01:10:35,630 --> 01:10:39,440
So I indulgent, I indulge it
like a little baby, like a child.

1258
01:10:39,441 --> 01:10:42,590
Like I just gravitate towards things
that I like to do and you know,

1259
01:10:42,591 --> 01:10:46,880
people could say it's stereotypically
toxic masculinity or whatever. Okay,

1260
01:10:47,060 --> 01:10:49,550
whatever. I'm nice. I'm a nice person,

1261
01:10:49,820 --> 01:10:53,240
but I gravitate towards manly shit.
I like watching fights.

1262
01:10:53,270 --> 01:10:57,950
I liked doing martial arts. You're like
fighting, watching fights, like cars.

1263
01:10:58,010 --> 01:10:58,990
I like these things.
I mean,

1264
01:10:59,000 --> 01:11:02,120
one of my got to pretend that I don't
like them to make other people feel happy.

1265
01:11:02,340 --> 01:11:04,370
Some people will feel intimidated
by that. Like, oh, it's too Mami.

1266
01:11:04,371 --> 01:11:07,550
Oh that's the problem is you don't
want to look like an asshole.

1267
01:11:07,580 --> 01:11:10,410
Which I've experienced. You know, I
look like an ass. He will tell you that.

1268
01:11:10,411 --> 01:11:13,010
So I'll just look why me?
I look like an asshole to me.

1269
01:11:13,020 --> 01:11:14,040
I'm sure I look like an asshole.

1270
01:11:14,040 --> 01:11:17,160
The others I don't think appreciate that.
Wow,

1271
01:11:17,170 --> 01:11:20,580
this guy looks like a decent guy
coming out of that fancy Tusla.

1272
01:11:22,360 --> 01:11:23,020
Actually,

1273
01:11:23,020 --> 01:11:25,440
I would think you're an environmentalist
and I probably have a Douche bag and

1274
01:11:25,650 --> 01:11:29,560
probably like Super Vegan. Yeah,
look at them annoying. Right?

1275
01:11:30,480 --> 01:11:32,040
Doesn't want your kids to get vaccinated

1276
01:11:36,170 --> 01:11:38,810
doing the shit you want to do that.
That's, that's definitely a big deal, Dan.

1277
01:11:38,820 --> 01:11:40,380
So I definitely respect that about you.

1278
01:11:40,440 --> 01:11:41,840
I've seen that more people should do that.

1279
01:11:41,850 --> 01:11:45,150
And I think one of the things that we
have a problem with people doing what they

1280
01:11:45,151 --> 01:11:48,550
want to do is cause we don't get
to do what we want to do. Right.

1281
01:11:48,570 --> 01:11:52,110
So when we see other people, they're
like, yeah, that's bullshit. We get mad.

1282
01:11:52,111 --> 01:11:55,740
Or we like, he doesn't even really like
that stuff. Or He's, you know, Oh yeah,

1283
01:11:55,741 --> 01:11:56,151
you're,
you're,

1284
01:11:56,151 --> 01:11:59,490
you're just falling into the typical
stereotypical masculine behavior.

1285
01:11:59,670 --> 01:12:02,820
Maybe explore your sensitivity,
man. Why would you say that?

1286
01:12:02,940 --> 01:12:04,830
Because the pitch pitches telling
you how to do shit. I hate that.

1287
01:12:05,070 --> 01:12:07,260
It's usually men that are bitches.
Yeah. There's a lot of those.

1288
01:12:07,590 --> 01:12:11,360
Funny how that works. Yeah. Any names for
me now? I'm just gonna write them down.

1289
01:12:11,910 --> 01:12:14,040
Write down. So speaking of that, so

1290
01:12:14,150 --> 01:12:17,230
interesting story for
you. So, um, yeah, I was,

1291
01:12:17,231 --> 01:12:20,050
I was kind of talking back to a tier guy
back and forth about being on the show.

1292
01:12:20,440 --> 01:12:24,850
And the craziest thing happened where I
was out here have to actually work on a

1293
01:12:24,851 --> 01:12:29,851
tussle related project o and m to top
secrets going to come out in a couple of

1294
01:12:29,980 --> 01:12:34,960
months, but basically, uh, does that
my job, right? And then I was like,

1295
01:12:34,961 --> 01:12:38,050
hey listen, I got to take a week
off to go out to California,

1296
01:12:38,051 --> 01:12:41,500
work on this project. And then I was
talking to your guy and they're like,

1297
01:12:41,501 --> 01:12:45,120
hey listen, you're going to be out here.
Come back the next week as well. You know,

1298
01:12:45,121 --> 01:12:46,780
as you could say, hey listen,
you have two weeks out here.

1299
01:12:47,310 --> 01:12:52,150
I told my boss and he's like, listen man,
like two weeks is kind of a long time.

1300
01:12:52,151 --> 01:12:53,800
You don't have any coverage.
Like you know,

1301
01:12:53,830 --> 01:12:55,480
I knew he'd be on Joe Rogan's really cool,

1302
01:12:55,481 --> 01:12:58,030
but I'm going to fucking
let you do that or not.

1303
01:12:58,600 --> 01:13:02,590
So made a decision following in
your light. I said, you know what?

1304
01:13:02,860 --> 01:13:07,390
I'm going to leave my job then. Oh Shit.
I left my job man. Damn, I left my job,

1305
01:13:07,391 --> 01:13:11,910
which is why I'm here. I need a
job. Joe was just fucking with you.

1306
01:13:11,911 --> 01:13:13,400
But you really leave
your job. I did. Yeah.

1307
01:13:13,820 --> 01:13:17,140
It was a big thing because I had this
whole meme thing going on my youtube

1308
01:13:17,141 --> 01:13:20,500
channel. Uh, and I used to say,
oh, I have a full time job.

1309
01:13:20,501 --> 01:13:22,730
I can't work on these bills. I
can't do this. I can't do that.

1310
01:13:22,731 --> 01:13:27,340
I was getting in the way and you
have no idea. I finally left,

1311
01:13:27,341 --> 01:13:29,570
and this is kind of
the, I was reading, um,

1312
01:13:30,370 --> 01:13:33,220
your story awhile back about how you
got started, the whole comedy thing,

1313
01:13:33,221 --> 01:13:35,230
how you went out, you flood
in Boston, went to La,

1314
01:13:35,770 --> 01:13:40,240
and it just felt so liberating
because literally, you know,

1315
01:13:40,390 --> 01:13:42,700
when you're doing something
you're not passionate about,

1316
01:13:43,090 --> 01:13:48,090
that's literally eight to 10 hours of
your day doing something that you just,

1317
01:13:48,281 --> 01:13:51,040
you just don't really want to do.
It's most of your day. It's, yeah,

1318
01:13:51,290 --> 01:13:53,810
because most of your day, so,
so it's insane. So I thought
to myself, you know what?

1319
01:13:53,811 --> 01:13:56,860
Everyone's in the rat race.
Everyone's rushing to get somewhere.

1320
01:13:57,070 --> 01:13:59,140
Every year you're in,
you know about Boston,

1321
01:13:59,141 --> 01:14:00,700
like you're rushing to get on the train,

1322
01:14:01,030 --> 01:14:03,940
you're rushing to get somewhere
that you don't really want to be.

1323
01:14:03,941 --> 01:14:07,690
You're rushing there to work for eight
hours for someone else doing something

1324
01:14:07,691 --> 01:14:12,100
that you don't want to do and it
just gets taxing. Yeah, it was, it

1325
01:14:12,100 --> 01:14:13,450
was, it was just taxing. So I,

1326
01:14:13,470 --> 01:14:16,600
and you're not going to do your best
with the things you do afterwards.

1327
01:14:16,601 --> 01:14:19,780
If you've been doing this thing for eight
hours, four hours that you have before,

1328
01:14:19,781 --> 01:14:21,580
you really have to go to bed.
When you get home at night,

1329
01:14:21,880 --> 01:14:25,390
you're not going to have the same kind
of energy that you had at noon or 10:00

1330
01:14:25,390 --> 01:14:28,580
AM or whatever it was when you woke up
or when you got to work your, what you,

1331
01:14:28,590 --> 01:14:32,690
what you're dealing with is this
past, this crossroads, right? You've,

1332
01:14:32,700 --> 01:14:37,700
you've hit this path where you can decide
to either not take a chance and just,

1333
01:14:39,660 --> 01:14:43,810
you just slowly take like
little incremental steps
towards what you really want

1334
01:14:43,811 --> 01:14:48,010
to do or take a risk. Right?
And when you take a risk, yeah,

1335
01:14:48,011 --> 01:14:50,470
you don't have health insurance,
dental, you don't have to, you know,

1336
01:14:50,670 --> 01:14:53,590
that's what the risk is all about,
but that's, that's the only way.

1337
01:14:53,740 --> 01:14:55,570
And people were like, good,
but would have a fool.

1338
01:14:55,780 --> 01:14:58,390
But you can't think like that
because if you think like that,

1339
01:14:58,391 --> 01:15:01,210
you're going to fail set. And
second of all, yeah, you might.

1340
01:15:01,390 --> 01:15:03,160
But then you got to do it again.

1341
01:15:03,460 --> 01:15:08,460
And if you continue to just fail and do
it again one day you'll figure out why

1342
01:15:08,921 --> 01:15:09,754
you were failing.

1343
01:15:09,760 --> 01:15:12,910
If you're paying attention and if you're
doing your work and then you'll find

1344
01:15:12,911 --> 01:15:14,740
something that you can do
that you're successful at.

1345
01:15:14,830 --> 01:15:17,440
If somebody wants to hire you,
if you're good at your job,

1346
01:15:17,950 --> 01:15:20,860
if you go to a place and you're
valuable to that employer,

1347
01:15:20,861 --> 01:15:22,240
you could be valuable to yourself.

1348
01:15:22,690 --> 01:15:26,500
You just got to figure out how to do it
or what it is that you want to do that

1349
01:15:26,530 --> 01:15:31,000
you could do without having a boss
without, and something that feels natural,

1350
01:15:31,001 --> 01:15:31,960
something that you are,
you're,

1351
01:15:31,990 --> 01:15:35,230
you gravitate towards when you get up in
the morning and go, I'm fucking pumped.

1352
01:15:35,410 --> 01:15:39,280
I'm going to like, I want to do it
myself and I'm gonna do my thing. Right.

1353
01:15:39,310 --> 01:15:43,060
There's not a time or ever come here
to do a podcast where I go, fuck,

1354
01:15:43,090 --> 01:15:45,430
I can't believe I have to do this. Right.
Not a time. I've makes me feel good.

1355
01:15:45,431 --> 01:15:49,690
Thank you. Not Today. Not ever. Never.
I mean, there's times where I leave.

1356
01:15:49,730 --> 01:15:51,210
I was like,
what the fuck was that about?

1357
01:15:51,250 --> 01:15:55,420
I can imagine there's a couple in a
thousand, whatever podcasts I've done,

1358
01:15:55,421 --> 01:15:57,640
there's only been like a small
handful of those that had been like,

1359
01:15:57,641 --> 01:16:00,580
what the fuck was that? Right.
If you can do that, man,

1360
01:16:00,581 --> 01:16:02,650
if you can find that
thing that you love to do,

1361
01:16:02,651 --> 01:16:06,520
whether it's making furniture or
fucking painting or whatever it is,

1362
01:16:06,521 --> 01:16:10,300
if you can ask it, he can make
a living doing that. God Damn,

1363
01:16:10,660 --> 01:16:15,010
that's everything. It changes the world,
the world, it becomes a better place.

1364
01:16:15,220 --> 01:16:18,850
That's the goal, man. So, so we'll see.
So again, I took some cues from, uh,

1365
01:16:18,910 --> 01:16:21,760
from some inspiration from you when
you left Boston and you're like,

1366
01:16:21,761 --> 01:16:24,490
you know what, I'm going to do this comedy
thing. I want to figure it out. So what,

1367
01:16:24,880 --> 01:16:27,790
what was that like for you? So when did
you make the determination to say, hey,

1368
01:16:27,791 --> 01:16:30,310
you know what, I work at
this Gig, uh, you know,

1369
01:16:30,311 --> 01:16:32,970
this isn't the thing that I want to do.
And you made the jump, like what does it,

1370
01:16:32,971 --> 01:16:37,630
what was that like? The Boston thing
was super lucky. Um, I was only 25,

1371
01:16:38,110 --> 01:16:42,490
less 24 dash 24.
And uh,

1372
01:16:42,640 --> 01:16:47,290
I was doing standup and I was driving
limos during the day and doing a bunch of

1373
01:16:47,291 --> 01:16:49,650
different odd jobs and shit. And then, um,

1374
01:16:50,110 --> 01:16:55,110
I got seen by a manager who is coming
from New York to Boston to scout for new

1375
01:16:55,301 --> 01:16:59,560
talent. Okay. I just got dumb
luck. It wasn't even supposed
to be on the show. And,

1376
01:16:59,561 --> 01:17:03,160
uh, he asked me to go to New York
and do some spots in New York.

1377
01:17:03,161 --> 01:17:07,540
I did some spots there. And then, uh, next
thing you know, I was living in New York.

1378
01:17:07,541 --> 01:17:09,530
I signed a contract with them and I just

1379
01:17:10,220 --> 01:17:13,850
packed up my shit and my grandparents
were still living in New Jersey.

1380
01:17:14,030 --> 01:17:16,270
They live on North Ninth Street,
which is like a,

1381
01:17:16,640 --> 01:17:19,610
when the time when they first moved there,
it was a pretty nice neighborhood,

1382
01:17:19,611 --> 01:17:23,600
middle class. But then as New York has
got kind of Funky, it's like skid row now.

1383
01:17:23,630 --> 01:17:27,710
Yeah. Well it's just, it, it
was the next door neighbor, uh,

1384
01:17:27,711 --> 01:17:29,060
while I was living with him,

1385
01:17:29,061 --> 01:17:31,940
they broke down his house door
cause he was selling crack. Oh,

1386
01:17:31,941 --> 01:17:35,570
he had a dope Audi parked in his
driveway and they smashed his door with a

1387
01:17:35,571 --> 01:17:39,040
battering ram. And it was a, it
was a legit, it was an experience.

1388
01:17:39,070 --> 01:17:42,540
Sketchy neighborhood. Um, but
that's, so that's what I did.

1389
01:17:42,541 --> 01:17:45,920
I just packed up my shit and moved. I
mean, I didn't have any money. I didn't,

1390
01:17:46,010 --> 01:17:49,280
I didn't know if it was going to work
out at all, but I knew this was a chance,

1391
01:17:49,281 --> 01:17:53,840
but I was young. When you're 24, you're
like, whatever, insurance, whatever.

1392
01:17:53,900 --> 01:17:56,630
I didn't have health insurance for a long
time. Do you have it now? Yeah. Okay,

1393
01:17:56,631 --> 01:18:00,410
good. That's good. Yeah. You got it.
Did you read it when you quit this job?

1394
01:18:00,411 --> 01:18:02,750
Do you have it? Why? My wife has
it. Okay, well, there you go.

1395
01:18:02,751 --> 01:18:07,190
So that was a scary shit. Hey listen.
What did she say? She said, go for it.

1396
01:18:07,310 --> 01:18:10,700
Ooh, I like it. Good. You've got a good
one. Yeah, go for it. She's like, yeah,

1397
01:18:10,701 --> 01:18:15,050
go for it. Because the tough thing is
that, uh, it's, you know, I had my little,

1398
01:18:15,080 --> 01:18:17,780
my little shitty Lou
tube channel and yeah,

1399
01:18:17,781 --> 01:18:19,220
but your youtube channel is pretty big.

1400
01:18:19,250 --> 01:18:21,670
You're saying it's a shitty youtube
channel. We sell a lot of meetings.

1401
01:18:21,700 --> 01:18:24,440
It was funny. I say that, but it's
hard because I don't want to be,

1402
01:18:24,830 --> 01:18:28,070
you want to be a dick? I don't wanna be a
dick, but I have this massive following.

1403
01:18:28,071 --> 01:18:29,540
Well, how big, how many
subscribers do you have?

1404
01:18:29,780 --> 01:18:33,030
400 that's pretty God damn cousin or
something like that. That's pretty good.

1405
01:18:33,031 --> 01:18:35,830
Yeah, I'm good. Yeah, it's not bad.
That's pretty good at, I'm good. So yes,

1406
01:18:35,840 --> 01:18:39,980
I fixed his cars. Rebuilt the Tesla's
are shit. Yeah, it's not bad. Right.

1407
01:18:40,020 --> 01:18:44,210
And to think that I have a mass that kind
of falling only fixing really one car

1408
01:18:44,330 --> 01:18:45,290
right now.

1409
01:18:45,291 --> 01:18:49,540
Imagine if you put all your time
into the Bingo and we'll pick it up.

1410
01:18:49,870 --> 01:18:53,800
And after the show I'm a,
what's it called? On Youtube?
A retreat builds. Oh Shit.

1411
01:18:54,870 --> 01:18:59,690
Subscribe my scribe. Yeah. Oh, there you
go. It's great. Videos are really cool.

1412
01:19:00,120 --> 01:19:03,860
Oh, the Nice described.
Subscribe. Oh awesome. That's a,

1413
01:19:03,870 --> 01:19:06,400
that's a perfect shot of me by
the way. The, the frozen photos.

1414
01:19:08,780 --> 01:19:10,040
But your videos are excellent.

1415
01:19:10,070 --> 01:19:12,410
You're really good at it and you're
really good at explaining things and you

1416
01:19:12,411 --> 01:19:15,110
have a good sense of humor when
you're doing it. And it's interesting.

1417
01:19:15,920 --> 01:19:19,250
It's interesting stuff. Yeah. I try
to be, it's funny because there's,

1418
01:19:19,640 --> 01:19:22,940
I'm not a super genius. There's other
people building Tesla's left and right.

1419
01:19:22,970 --> 01:19:25,820
And is there a lot of other people
that are getting killed now? There is.

1420
01:19:25,821 --> 01:19:27,830
They're getting more involved in it
and they're starting their own little

1421
01:19:27,831 --> 01:19:30,830
channels and stuff, but my thing is
I want to be a little bit different.

1422
01:19:30,831 --> 01:19:34,160
I want to add some kind of humor and
like comedy to it to make it interesting

1423
01:19:34,670 --> 01:19:35,481
because quite frankly,

1424
01:19:35,481 --> 01:19:38,750
not everyone thinks building a tussle is
really that funny or interesting or fun,

1425
01:19:39,170 --> 01:19:42,710
you know, setting a humorous spin to it
makes this, yeah, no, you're great at it.

1426
01:19:42,980 --> 01:19:46,880
And you know when you look
at any other kind of car,

1427
01:19:46,940 --> 01:19:49,610
like if you buy a Chevy or
if you buy even a, you know,

1428
01:19:49,611 --> 01:19:50,880
a Porsche or something like that,
right?

1429
01:19:50,930 --> 01:19:53,450
You can find these little mom
and pop fixing chops. Right?

1430
01:19:53,630 --> 01:19:56,480
You can find them all over the place.
Absolutely. All around. You know,

1431
01:19:56,481 --> 01:20:00,640
you go to a West hills, there's a bunch
of places that fix cars, right? Hey,

1432
01:20:00,650 --> 01:20:03,170
did something wrong? My transmission,
can you look at it? No problem.

1433
01:20:03,380 --> 01:20:05,540
They put it on the left and go, Oh,
you've got a leak here. You've got this,

1434
01:20:05,541 --> 01:20:09,570
you got that with the Tesla, you're on
your own son. That's, he sang it to Tesla.

1435
01:20:09,571 --> 01:20:12,900
I now man or Nada and I get
it from their point of view,

1436
01:20:12,901 --> 01:20:15,480
they don't want a bunch of people
monkeying around with their shit. Yeah.

1437
01:20:15,960 --> 01:20:17,670
But even like Mac,

1438
01:20:18,530 --> 01:20:22,660
like you can go to the genius store,
which is gross genius bar. Yeah.

1439
01:20:22,680 --> 01:20:25,710
Whatever the fuck that name.
And that's gross genius bar.

1440
01:20:25,711 --> 01:20:28,950
But she didn't let me see your Iq tests.
That's a bit pompous.

1441
01:20:30,210 --> 01:20:33,090
Some of them people, again, not genius,
I'm smarter than you or whatever.

1442
01:20:33,360 --> 01:20:37,740
So you can either go there or you can go
to these little mom and pop mac stores.

1443
01:20:37,840 --> 01:20:42,570
Those do exist. Exactly. And they're not
approved, but they can fix your computer.

1444
01:20:42,620 --> 01:20:45,930
They get shit done. They get shit done.
So that's the goal for me. So you know,

1445
01:20:45,931 --> 01:20:46,890
I'm starting my own shop.

1446
01:20:47,220 --> 01:20:50,490
I'm finding a shop called the electrified
garage and that's like, well, I like it.

1447
01:20:50,520 --> 01:20:54,480
Yeah, not bad. That's good name. Oh,
I got some swag for you too. Um, so,

1448
01:20:54,510 --> 01:20:57,810
and that's the biggest thing is because
there's no mom and pop shop to fix

1449
01:20:57,811 --> 01:20:58,370
testlets right?

1450
01:20:58,370 --> 01:21:01,380
Like right now it's the only game
in town if they're pumping out what,

1451
01:21:01,381 --> 01:21:04,710
like 5,000 cars a week. Now we
thought it was a week. Right.

1452
01:21:04,740 --> 01:21:07,800
Which doesn't seem like much, but for a
small company, it's insane. That's a lot.

1453
01:21:07,830 --> 01:21:12,690
And he's not a day, it's 30 days. It's a
lie. It's like what, 20 20,000 a month.

1454
01:21:12,720 --> 01:21:16,680
That's just, I don't know, 5,000 a week.
Oh yeah. It was like 20,000 a month or so.

1455
01:21:16,740 --> 01:21:21,230
Geez. About that. So, um, and
then all of these thousand cars,

1456
01:21:21,250 --> 01:21:24,110
a lot. It's a lot of cars, right? Tell
you that. That's a lot of friggen cards.

1457
01:21:24,120 --> 01:21:26,790
I think they're too busy. So
it's social right now. You know,

1458
01:21:26,791 --> 01:21:30,560
there's only two places to fix Teslas in
my state. So when someone's like, Hey,

1459
01:21:30,561 --> 01:21:32,730
I wanna get my car fixed, you called
[inaudible], they're like, yeah,

1460
01:21:32,731 --> 01:21:35,580
that'd be about, you know, maybe a week.
I get you in like maybe two weeks. Oh,

1461
01:21:35,581 --> 01:21:38,280
you get you in in a week. Yeah. I'll
get you in a week, maybe two weeks,

1462
01:21:39,150 --> 01:21:41,670
sometimes three weeks, sometimes a
month. Yeah. People weight loss, man,

1463
01:21:42,150 --> 01:21:43,620
so that's the goal.

1464
01:21:43,650 --> 01:21:46,200
So I'm opening it up and it should be
open to probably know in a month or so and

1465
01:21:46,201 --> 01:21:50,040
then we'll drive people there. I have
a fantasy of one day building a car.

1466
01:21:50,190 --> 01:21:54,390
We're going to build a 69 Camaro.
I thought you had one. No, I don't.

1467
01:21:54,391 --> 01:21:55,640
For some reason we hit
with a whole bunch of cars.

1468
01:21:55,650 --> 01:22:00,600
I just try to have a 65 corvette, but I
just, Oh, you had no, you had a barracuda.

1469
01:22:00,970 --> 01:22:05,770
That's where the 70 Barracuda. Yeah. Get
rid of that. Why it had problems. Yeah.

1470
01:22:06,020 --> 01:22:09,960
I had all the problems fixed, but it
was more designed to look really good.

1471
01:22:10,210 --> 01:22:14,760
You look really good. It was a
beautiful car, but it wasn't my style.

1472
01:22:14,970 --> 01:22:18,480
I like a car that you can like that
little corvette that I think drives like a

1473
01:22:18,481 --> 01:22:21,740
modern car. I'll give you drive
that thing and handles it. It's,

1474
01:22:21,770 --> 01:22:25,260
it's got fuel injection
and it just feels right.

1475
01:22:25,290 --> 01:22:30,290
It feels like it feels like a car that
is not dangerous that Barracuda was like

1476
01:22:30,600 --> 01:22:34,510
anytime you want and you stomp the
gas if you've taken a turn. Totally.

1477
01:22:34,560 --> 01:22:37,050
Such a way is fun. Yeah,
a little bit. Yeah.

1478
01:22:37,140 --> 01:22:42,090
But it's so front heavy like it had a
giant ass engine and it was a, it was uh,

1479
01:22:42,420 --> 01:22:44,040
it was beautiful,
beautiful car.

1480
01:22:44,220 --> 01:22:47,460
It also wasn't a stick shift and that
annoyed the fuck it's automatic and it was

1481
01:22:47,461 --> 01:22:51,090
an automatic one thing here
that I know it was ill but um,

1482
01:22:51,990 --> 01:22:52,823
what was my point?

1483
01:22:53,610 --> 01:22:57,780
I forgot that I have this
fantasy of building a car,

1484
01:22:57,990 --> 01:23:01,290
like to spend the time and actually put
it together because I would imagine that

1485
01:23:01,291 --> 01:23:05,110
the way you feel when you drive that
Tesla is like this crazy feeling of

1486
01:23:05,111 --> 01:23:06,190
satisfaction that you,

1487
01:23:06,250 --> 01:23:11,250
you made that thing much like the way you
feel if you hunt and you eat the steak

1488
01:23:11,681 --> 01:23:14,830
from an animal that you shot yourself
right now you drive that car around,

1489
01:23:14,831 --> 01:23:17,380
you built that fucking thing. Right. It's
all about the hunt. Well you know what,

1490
01:23:17,710 --> 01:23:21,040
part of it's the hunt and the chase
though. Yeah. Because now the is built,

1491
01:23:21,070 --> 01:23:23,840
I'm Kinda like all right now what,
you know what I mean?

1492
01:23:24,350 --> 01:23:27,040
Act after you haunt act to you.
You know, you take that kill shot,

1493
01:23:27,370 --> 01:23:28,620
you want to do it again.
Yeah.

1494
01:23:28,640 --> 01:23:31,300
We want to hit something different or
kill an elephant next time when I'm in the

1495
01:23:31,301 --> 01:23:35,120
phone. But like, you know, I'm like,
oh, I'm sorry. Sorry about that. Yeah,

1496
01:23:35,200 --> 01:23:37,360
that's what I don't get that one.

1497
01:23:37,390 --> 01:23:42,350
I don't even do people kill
to eat them. They eat. Yeah.

1498
01:23:42,370 --> 01:23:46,270
Well the thing is when they do kill them
and the villagers get to eat the food,

1499
01:23:46,271 --> 01:23:49,930
they get very excited about it. Yeah.
Apparently elephants are delicious.

1500
01:23:50,020 --> 01:23:54,070
I don't give us a lot of meat and so much
mean, but that's the thing that if, um,

1501
01:23:54,490 --> 01:23:58,060
it's one thing that we don't want to ever
think about when it comes to like, um,

1502
01:23:58,510 --> 01:24:01,420
conservation these animals.
But the,

1503
01:24:01,421 --> 01:24:06,421
the money that a hunter would spend to
kill an elephant goes towards making sure

1504
01:24:08,111 --> 01:24:11,530
that the elephant population that's
healthy and patches for all these game

1505
01:24:11,531 --> 01:24:14,680
wardens or where they call
Ph is right in Africa.

1506
01:24:14,800 --> 01:24:19,660
And then the money also goes to some
of these villages and then the food,

1507
01:24:19,780 --> 01:24:21,820
the meat from the animal
goes to these villages,

1508
01:24:22,240 --> 01:24:26,210
but still you shouldn't have fucking
elephant. I feel like bad. Yeah.

1509
01:24:26,230 --> 01:24:28,930
It's weird how like you feel bad for
killing an elephant, but other animals,

1510
01:24:28,931 --> 01:24:32,200
it's like a rat. You kind of deserve it.
Yeah. Rack gets hit by a car, you cheer.

1511
01:24:32,230 --> 01:24:36,220
You're like, yeah, you're fucking, because
I hit it myself. Right? Yeah. We're,

1512
01:24:36,290 --> 01:24:38,110
we're totally w you know,

1513
01:24:38,111 --> 01:24:42,790
bias towards certain types of animals
and for sure it's like why we uh,

1514
01:24:43,240 --> 01:24:46,750
how they say it, why be feed pigeons?
But we like, we shoot bald eagles.

1515
01:24:47,040 --> 01:24:48,640
It's majestic. Yeah. You want it.

1516
01:24:48,670 --> 01:24:51,970
Do you see that Beluga whale
that they caught that had a net?

1517
01:24:52,100 --> 01:24:55,090
It had a harness on it and they
think that the Russians, but,

1518
01:24:55,280 --> 01:24:58,690
and now they think it was,
they were using it as a bio weapon.

1519
01:24:58,900 --> 01:25:01,540
Like they would strap a
missile to this thing. Oh.

1520
01:25:01,600 --> 01:25:05,140
And then tell the whale to go to boats.
How do you tell where to go to a boat?

1521
01:25:05,500 --> 01:25:07,470
This way I was trained
to go towards boats.

1522
01:25:07,471 --> 01:25:09,730
Hold and it had this
harness on it and they,

1523
01:25:09,750 --> 01:25:14,680
they think that what they did was they
trained this thing to go towards the

1524
01:25:14,681 --> 01:25:17,720
boat. It's choking the shit
out of that thing. Well it,

1525
01:25:17,740 --> 01:25:20,440
you could use something
like that to hold a bomb,

1526
01:25:21,340 --> 01:25:24,610
train it to go towards the boat and
then when it would hit the boat it would

1527
01:25:24,611 --> 01:25:26,050
detonate the bomb and explode.

1528
01:25:26,410 --> 01:25:30,520
So they must have given him this way
or some sort of food reward for banging

1529
01:25:30,521 --> 01:25:32,280
into the boat.
So

1530
01:25:34,350 --> 01:25:38,920
they cut it free of this, uh, this
harness, I mean this is total speculation.

1531
01:25:38,921 --> 01:25:40,540
They don't know where
the harness came from,

1532
01:25:40,840 --> 01:25:43,330
but I'm hoping someone was trying
to ride it and they weren't shy.

1533
01:25:43,450 --> 01:25:46,690
It's probably a bomb though. Pretty
sure. Pretty sure it's a bomb.

1534
01:25:46,750 --> 01:25:50,610
I'm pretty sure look at this whale found
off Norway coast believed to be spying

1535
01:25:50,620 --> 01:25:54,550
for bunch of cameras and stuff too.
I might just be click baity bullshit too.

1536
01:25:54,551 --> 01:25:57,790
Right. Who wrote this article? Are they
an expert? Are they a security expert?

1537
01:25:57,980 --> 01:26:00,540
And they just have a way of
with a harness, right. We
don't really know what that,

1538
01:26:00,541 --> 01:26:03,180
how often do whales would harness to
show up to the fact that you're an expert

1539
01:26:03,230 --> 01:26:04,100
can speak intelligently

1540
01:26:04,100 --> 01:26:04,550
about it.

1541
01:26:04,550 --> 01:26:09,550
I think that the u s government owed
it's red equipment of Saint Petersburg on

1542
01:26:10,821 --> 01:26:12,770
the strap. Oh Shit. Yeah.

1543
01:26:12,771 --> 01:26:15,650
But if I wanted to trick people into
thinking that the Russians were involved,

1544
01:26:15,680 --> 01:26:18,710
I wouldn't make it super obvious. Right.
That too. Yeah. Why would you write that?

1545
01:26:19,090 --> 01:26:22,580
We got a fake train. I'll whale
and incentives. Right, exactly.

1546
01:26:22,581 --> 01:26:26,450
Look what you're doing. You've got to look
into exactly. Made in Russia by Russia.

1547
01:26:26,540 --> 01:26:27,373
Exactly.

1548
01:26:28,100 --> 01:26:31,900
I would write maiden rush on it is
all in English to Russian letters.

1549
01:26:32,540 --> 01:26:34,520
Property of mother Russia.
I love Russia.

1550
01:26:34,580 --> 01:26:37,810
I think the government did
that with dolphins sea.

1551
01:26:37,870 --> 01:26:41,540
See if that's true that the government
trained dolphins to for weapons.

1552
01:26:41,541 --> 01:26:44,660
Plenty of them. Yeah. I
think US government did that.

1553
01:26:44,661 --> 01:26:48,820
Find out what the train dolphins
to blow up boats. Damn Dude.

1554
01:26:49,120 --> 01:26:51,920
What a place.
What a place we live in now.

1555
01:26:51,940 --> 01:26:55,730
We basically trained dolphins to BG
hottest, but they didn't know it.

1556
01:26:55,940 --> 01:26:58,660
They didn't know there were, at least
the jihadists knows. Right? I mean,

1557
01:26:58,670 --> 01:27:03,050
you tricked him into going 72 virgins
and blowing up. You trick them,

1558
01:27:03,470 --> 01:27:06,010
but the dolphin doesn't even
know it's going to die. Yeah,

1559
01:27:06,100 --> 01:27:09,470
it probably would be like, what? Wait a
minute. Well, I get fish. I love fish.

1560
01:27:09,471 --> 01:27:11,490
He just thinks he's going to get fish.
If he bumps into the boat,

1561
01:27:11,491 --> 01:27:14,510
just thing on my back. Oh, whatever.
I'll do. Oh my God. Yeah, that's it.

1562
01:27:16,480 --> 01:27:20,210
Yeah. It says it's a myth. Oh,
it's a matter of what's a myth?

1563
01:27:21,550 --> 01:27:25,100
I spread sex doll. This information.
Yeah. Well, who says that? The navy.

1564
01:27:26,450 --> 01:27:31,130
My stories. No second guesses
everything. Is that true? Who wrote them?

1565
01:27:31,160 --> 01:27:33,660
But then in 2015 it says that the US Navy,

1566
01:27:33,661 --> 01:27:38,130
its combat dolphins are serious
military assets. So started,

1567
01:27:38,150 --> 01:27:41,870
stopped and started though. So
here's the thing. Why don't they,

1568
01:27:41,930 --> 01:27:42,960
why are they sending dog?

1569
01:27:42,980 --> 01:27:47,680
One is build robots to do it because
the robots aren't as advanced as it goes

1570
01:27:47,690 --> 01:27:51,020
for a while. Often they can't go
through the water the way a dolphin can,

1571
01:27:51,021 --> 01:27:54,680
and it would look like a robot of Dolphin.
They're Dunkin to do shit.

1572
01:27:54,681 --> 01:27:56,070
They're always in the water.
Oh right.

1573
01:27:56,090 --> 01:27:58,610
And get something that's an
organic part of the environment.

1574
01:27:58,611 --> 01:28:00,560
And then they're got to kill every
dolphin that comes near the boat.

1575
01:28:01,130 --> 01:28:03,860
So they see a dolphin, they think it's
just a dolphin. Right. And then it,

1576
01:28:04,490 --> 01:28:05,031
why don't they,

1577
01:28:05,031 --> 01:28:08,870
why don't they have a missile painted
like a dolphin and the time they get it,

1578
01:28:08,871 --> 01:28:10,550
it's like, oh shit. Going too fast.

1579
01:28:10,760 --> 01:28:14,540
You creating killer dolphins escape
naval training base in search of love,

1580
01:28:15,350 --> 01:28:16,910
like it's accurate for some reason.

1581
01:28:16,911 --> 01:28:19,190
I don't know why I escaped
during Hurricane Katrina.

1582
01:28:19,580 --> 01:28:21,710
They've escaped multiple times
and I don't know, Howard,

1583
01:28:21,970 --> 01:28:24,740
if we're just training more,
these dolphins keep escaping everything.

1584
01:28:25,040 --> 01:28:28,010
We are going, the dolphins often
smarter than us. They keep escaping.

1585
01:28:28,011 --> 01:28:31,430
How do we not super smart. We not keep
ahold of these dolphins. Not on the loose.

1586
01:28:31,720 --> 01:28:33,620
And I don't know.
It's very confusing when you look it up.

1587
01:28:33,621 --> 01:28:37,310
So Ukrainian military dolphins, not
actually on loose. Who says that?

1588
01:28:37,340 --> 01:28:41,390
That's government G.
Dot. Gov. Hey, you know,

1589
01:28:41,690 --> 01:28:42,800
you're going the dolphins,

1590
01:28:42,801 --> 01:28:45,740
my fun dolphin factors that dolphins
and one of the few animals that have sex

1591
01:28:45,741 --> 01:28:49,990
for pleasure. Yeah. Other few chimps.
Dolphins, people. Yup. And uh,

1592
01:28:50,270 --> 01:28:55,100
dogs. Well, dogs. Just for fun. No,
I guess. Well then fuck your leg.

1593
01:28:55,101 --> 01:28:56,570
What are they trying to do?
I guess you're right.

1594
01:29:00,760 --> 01:29:02,010
Good point.
What are they trying to

1595
01:29:02,010 --> 01:29:04,560
prove? All right. Let me ask you this,
because you're all in the technology.

1596
01:29:04,561 --> 01:29:06,510
Go ahead. What do you
think about aliens? God,

1597
01:29:06,850 --> 01:29:10,560
this doesn't seem tech related at all.
Yeah. Um, do you think they exist?

1598
01:29:10,770 --> 01:29:15,330
Do you think they've ever
visited here? Oh God, no.

1599
01:29:15,390 --> 01:29:19,160
No. I don't think so. I think it would
have destroyed us. Really? Yeah. But why?

1600
01:29:19,200 --> 01:29:22,770
When we visit primitive tribes,
we don't destroy them necessarily.

1601
01:29:22,830 --> 01:29:25,050
Like we try to leave them alone.
Do we try,

1602
01:29:25,051 --> 01:29:28,400
but we end up destroying him one way
or the other anyways, I think we,

1603
01:29:28,430 --> 01:29:32,090
even when people do for sure, even when
we try to be nice, it's like, yeah, right.

1604
01:29:32,280 --> 01:29:34,900
Look at that. Try, but let's
analyze them saying a few photos,

1605
01:29:35,190 --> 01:29:38,160
let's give them food. And they die
pretty much. Yeah. There's always that.

1606
01:29:38,550 --> 01:29:41,490
There's that image of famous
image of these tribes.

1607
01:29:41,491 --> 01:29:44,130
People in Brazil and uncontacted
tribe and they're painted,

1608
01:29:44,300 --> 01:29:48,090
they're their body paint and then they
have arrows drawn at the helicopter.

1609
01:29:48,090 --> 01:29:52,020
Exactly. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Now they
know about helicopters necessarily.

1610
01:29:52,070 --> 01:29:54,050
The good freaking house,
the new sun. God. Yeah.

1611
01:29:54,060 --> 01:29:56,790
Now they worship any religion and
I can get, see, think about it.

1612
01:29:56,890 --> 01:29:59,590
Imagine if you were an uncontacted
tribe and all of a sudden he's talking

1613
01:29:59,610 --> 01:30:03,300
helicopter shows up. Whenever I see a
helicopter show, I freak out in general.

1614
01:30:03,330 --> 01:30:06,870
Yeah. In general. You know what I mean?
So like imagine that's, that's insane.

1615
01:30:06,900 --> 01:30:11,580
Have you ever been in one helicopter? Yes.
So weird. Right? Right. Is Weird. Yes.

1616
01:30:11,760 --> 01:30:15,240
Wait around like, okay, we're in the sky.
Weight makes noisy. Absolutely. But no,

1617
01:30:15,300 --> 01:30:19,400
I think, um, I don't know,
man. I think they would've
destroyed us. They'd be like,

1618
01:30:19,470 --> 01:30:20,520
these guys are stupid.

1619
01:30:20,580 --> 01:30:24,820
Don't you think they would want to watch
look like if you go to the zoo, right.

1620
01:30:24,900 --> 01:30:28,290
He'd go to the, the chimpanzee exhibit
and you'd watch him swing around and shit.

1621
01:30:28,290 --> 01:30:29,850
People love to watch the chimps.

1622
01:30:29,851 --> 01:30:34,410
It's probably one of the most popular
parts of the exhibit and we love watching

1623
01:30:34,411 --> 01:30:35,880
them like, oh, look at them, look at them.

1624
01:30:35,881 --> 01:30:38,570
And if you could go someplace where
you could wash them in the wild. Yeah,

1625
01:30:38,900 --> 01:30:42,570
like if there was like a Webcam or you
could tune in to the Congo right now,

1626
01:30:42,960 --> 01:30:45,750
you would definitely, how do we, how do
we know they're not watching us right now?

1627
01:30:45,810 --> 01:30:48,390
Exactly. That's the thing. They
probably are. They probably are,

1628
01:30:48,680 --> 01:30:52,400
but wouldn't they just like watch
and observe? So we were just,

1629
01:30:52,401 --> 01:30:53,231
we don't blow ourselves up.

1630
01:30:53,231 --> 01:30:55,320
So we would never know that in
general they could live among us.

1631
01:30:55,350 --> 01:30:56,970
We wouldn't know.
I mean,

1632
01:30:57,120 --> 01:31:01,410
I would imagine that if there was a
civilization that's on the cusp of some

1633
01:31:01,440 --> 01:31:04,920
major breakthrough as far as artificial
intelligence goes, which is where we are.

1634
01:31:04,950 --> 01:31:09,270
Right. In many ways. I think that we're
all super fortunate to be alive right now.

1635
01:31:09,271 --> 01:31:12,510
Absolutely. Because even though this
is a time of incredible turmoil,

1636
01:31:12,810 --> 01:31:16,680
it's also a time of an
amazing potential and change.

1637
01:31:16,710 --> 01:31:19,260
I'm greedy as hell that I want to
see more. I know I want to see more.

1638
01:31:19,261 --> 01:31:23,530
I want to see, I really want to see a
robot uprising. I, I'm dead serious,

1639
01:31:23,560 --> 01:31:25,200
don't I do.
I really do.

1640
01:31:25,350 --> 01:31:30,120
And I want to be like 90 ish years
old and I want there to be this super

1641
01:31:30,121 --> 01:31:34,140
advanced AI robot just to take
over and such shooting shit.

1642
01:31:34,290 --> 01:31:36,880
And I also want,
cause Elon Musk has head,

1643
01:31:36,930 --> 01:31:39,420
he'll still be alive because it had
to be in a jar and he'd be like,

1644
01:31:39,421 --> 01:31:40,500
I told you so.

1645
01:31:41,130 --> 01:31:44,550
I told you a little robot hand I told
you and what I want to see because it's

1646
01:31:44,551 --> 01:31:46,320
like, it's a cool, it's a terminator shit.

1647
01:31:46,780 --> 01:31:48,600
Unless you don't want to see that at all.

1648
01:31:48,960 --> 01:31:51,210
I want to see the aliens
come in and stop us. Right.

1649
01:31:51,211 --> 01:31:55,200
More about the hit the green switch to
turn on artificial intelligence on what?

1650
01:31:55,201 --> 01:31:59,590
The aliens to come down with
their little [inaudible] hand
go, hey, hey, hey, no, no,

1651
01:31:59,591 --> 01:32:03,310
no, no. They wouldn't do this. US The
robot gave his cars dynamic. Yeah,

1652
01:32:03,860 --> 01:32:06,620
it's wrestling with him. Right. That's
going to grab your Dick like that.

1653
01:32:07,840 --> 01:32:09,400
I might like it.
You're going to be beaten off.

1654
01:32:09,401 --> 01:32:11,460
That thing's going to come in and
let me help you. But the thing is,

1655
01:32:12,170 --> 01:32:15,700
what's what's stopping that from not
wrapping around his neck and just crushing

1656
01:32:15,701 --> 01:32:17,800
it? There's nothing stopping
it. If you get hacked,

1657
01:32:17,860 --> 01:32:20,740
take about the same people that helped
you make your Tesla work, right?

1658
01:32:20,741 --> 01:32:22,000
They're going to hack
into this fucking thing.

1659
01:32:22,001 --> 01:32:24,730
It's going to run right through your
walls. Skynet, it's going to eat your dog.

1660
01:32:25,080 --> 01:32:26,470
You've seen the ones that flip,
they,

1661
01:32:26,490 --> 01:32:29,410
they have them on trap pieces
like Cirque de Solei actually,

1662
01:32:29,411 --> 01:32:32,590
have you seen the part where they actually
beat the robots and less like, yeah.

1663
01:32:32,740 --> 01:32:34,600
You know what my favorite part of that is?
Well,

1664
01:32:34,670 --> 01:32:37,460
they beat the robots to find out
if the robots fall over right.

1665
01:32:37,461 --> 01:32:41,440
To kick them and shit. They're not just
hida released a statement I signed.

1666
01:32:41,450 --> 01:32:45,890
It's not cool. You can't do that
robot getting involved in everything.

1667
01:32:46,780 --> 01:32:50,980
You know what I mean? It's not cool. Wait,
how about, how about a robot coalition?

1668
01:32:51,070 --> 01:32:55,210
Should it be a robot coalition where
like we stand with robots to say, listen,

1669
01:32:55,211 --> 01:32:58,030
we built these things but we can't hit
them like that. And let me ask you this.

1670
01:32:58,180 --> 01:32:59,110
Here's the real question.

1671
01:32:59,860 --> 01:33:04,630
If you're 90 years old and you're still
lucid in your, but your body's failing,

1672
01:33:05,100 --> 01:33:06,440
your knees are gone and your,

1673
01:33:06,441 --> 01:33:09,340
your hip's bad and your back
hurts all the time and your,

1674
01:33:09,341 --> 01:33:12,940
your shoulders are all torn apart. You
can't pick things up and they say, rich,

1675
01:33:13,600 --> 01:33:18,600
we can download your consciousness
into this artificial body.

1676
01:33:19,390 --> 01:33:20,770
It's like you,

1677
01:33:20,800 --> 01:33:25,690
if you were Anderson Silva when he
was 30 years old, Black Mirror Shit,

1678
01:33:26,770 --> 01:33:29,880
they give you the super powerful
body, right? It's, it's,

1679
01:33:30,040 --> 01:33:31,900
you're going to feel it just like that,

1680
01:33:31,901 --> 01:33:36,130
but now you're going to be like a super
elite athlete and it's going to be you

1681
01:33:36,220 --> 01:33:37,300
and we'll put your consciousness,

1682
01:33:37,301 --> 01:33:41,470
or you can just go to black and see what
happens in the afterlife that let this

1683
01:33:41,471 --> 01:33:43,840
90 year old body. Dot. This
is the silliest question ever.

1684
01:33:44,020 --> 01:33:47,560
You're going to take the bird
in the hand, right? Yeah.

1685
01:33:47,561 --> 01:33:50,890
WHATSAPP delight might be bullshit,
right? I can enjoy myself right now.

1686
01:33:50,920 --> 01:33:54,490
Wouldn't you do that? Fuck yeah. Fuck
you actually want to do it right now.

1687
01:33:54,491 --> 01:33:56,710
I'm not even at 90. Well I think
that's how they're gonna get us.

1688
01:33:56,890 --> 01:34:00,490
I think slowly but surely they're going
to replace parts like there's already

1689
01:34:00,550 --> 01:34:01,680
amazing,
um,

1690
01:34:01,860 --> 01:34:06,760
artificial hands that you're creating
and you know limbs that are articulating

1691
01:34:06,761 --> 01:34:07,680
rims.
Here's I think,

1692
01:34:07,681 --> 01:34:10,270
would you want one of the limbs
that looks like a human limb.

1693
01:34:10,490 --> 01:34:12,420
We'd want like a robotic limb.
I can terminator.

1694
01:34:12,670 --> 01:34:14,820
I don't want to terminate her limb for
sure. What'd you for sure. I want to be,

1695
01:34:14,821 --> 01:34:17,050
want to stare at me.
But what if it was a nice and soft?

1696
01:34:17,890 --> 01:34:20,920
Do you think we're close to Robo cop then?
Like would that be maybe the first,

1697
01:34:21,250 --> 01:34:22,960
first step? Yeah, that's probably right.

1698
01:34:23,020 --> 01:34:24,880
They probably gonna do
that with like soldiers.

1699
01:34:24,990 --> 01:34:28,440
Chefy all the money's in military.
They'll drop the skeleton.

1700
01:34:28,450 --> 01:34:33,220
Drop 10 billion on that. I
met with robots, I ones at
Pechanga casino at the mall.

1701
01:34:33,221 --> 01:34:36,280
It's the most ridiculous thing. I have a
weird, I'll fuck that thing up. The one,

1702
01:34:37,450 --> 01:34:40,050
the one in the middle.
I want. So like I said,

1703
01:34:40,240 --> 01:34:43,620
I put my hat on it and it's had freaking
out. Did they get mad at you? Yeah,

1704
01:34:43,621 --> 01:34:46,420
it's just, it just starts playing around
in circles. I would if it, if it had,

1705
01:34:47,020 --> 01:34:50,110
I wish it had a gun on it. Oh No.
People will take it seriously.

1706
01:34:50,650 --> 01:34:52,570
Well that's the worry
about those dog things.

1707
01:34:52,600 --> 01:34:55,530
Those dog like robots that they just
put guns on those motherfuckers.

1708
01:34:55,540 --> 01:34:58,430
That is an episode of Black Mirror. That
episode. No, I didn't see that one. Yeah,

1709
01:34:58,431 --> 01:35:01,610
it's called heavy metal. Really? One of
the best episodes. This lady's run out.

1710
01:35:01,720 --> 01:35:06,710
Spoiler ladies running from these robots
had dogs. Not the head of that raw dog.

1711
01:35:06,711 --> 01:35:08,870
Looks like one of those things.
Yeah, I gotta check that out. Yeah.

1712
01:35:09,400 --> 01:35:14,300
And it has potential like actual
real technology that it's using.

1713
01:35:14,330 --> 01:35:17,120
So like it's not outlandish.
The thing is about Black Mirror,

1714
01:35:17,150 --> 01:35:21,360
everything is like that could
happen 100% but yeah, even a whole,

1715
01:35:21,361 --> 01:35:24,800
the thing with the implant memories
and you like live this crazy fake life,

1716
01:35:24,830 --> 01:35:26,750
right.
That's all that's on the horizon.

1717
01:35:26,870 --> 01:35:29,480
So you know what the interesting part
about Black Mirror is that there's a pro

1718
01:35:29,481 --> 01:35:31,610
and a con to everything,
right? So there was a,

1719
01:35:31,620 --> 01:35:34,940
an episode where a woman wanted to
keep better track of her daughter.

1720
01:35:35,300 --> 01:35:39,260
So she implanted that ship so she could
see whatever her daughter sees, right?

1721
01:35:39,590 --> 01:35:41,640
Then her daughter got older
and older and she said,

1722
01:35:41,690 --> 01:35:43,910
see some wild shit that the kid was doing.
Right?

1723
01:35:44,420 --> 01:35:46,700
But then to your example,

1724
01:35:46,730 --> 01:35:51,730
what would be the downside of putting my
consciousness in someone with a jacket

1725
01:35:52,491 --> 01:35:53,800
and like ripped body?
Well,

1726
01:35:53,890 --> 01:35:58,890
the downside would be would you even
really be a human anymore or would you be

1727
01:35:58,971 --> 01:36:02,870
some sort of a thing that we've created
that keeps your brain alive? Right?

1728
01:36:03,270 --> 01:36:06,320
But who cares? Who does care?
Well, well, here's the thing.

1729
01:36:06,800 --> 01:36:09,470
Would you want to live
a whole nother life?

1730
01:36:09,500 --> 01:36:12,920
Like how much time do you want in this
fake body? Do you want to be a mortal?

1731
01:36:12,950 --> 01:36:15,050
Do you want to keep going
forever? Not Forever now. I mean,

1732
01:36:15,060 --> 01:36:19,160
what do well at 200 years?
You know there's an old story about that,

1733
01:36:19,460 --> 01:36:21,260
about a guy,
God dammit.

1734
01:36:21,580 --> 01:36:26,580
It's like an old legend about a man who
kept killing his sons in order to live

1735
01:36:28,221 --> 01:36:31,550
longer. That God came to him and
told him if you kill the son,

1736
01:36:31,640 --> 01:36:33,410
and he lived to be like
thousands of years old,

1737
01:36:33,411 --> 01:36:35,790
but he just had no one around him.
They cared about him and love somebody,

1738
01:36:35,820 --> 01:36:38,960
a job in the Bible, something like that.
Whatever. Keep going since from something.

1739
01:36:38,980 --> 01:36:43,490
Yeah, I don't remember. But the point
is like when you got to 200 years,

1740
01:36:43,520 --> 01:36:46,910
if you said, okay, I'm going to take this
body and we live in it for 200 years,

1741
01:36:47,060 --> 01:36:48,730
but at 200 years I'll be
done. That's it. Right?

1742
01:36:49,100 --> 01:36:53,510
198 years comes along and you still
like a 30 year old Anderson Silva.

1743
01:36:53,540 --> 01:36:56,150
I couldn't do it. You're having
a great time. It's a good point.

1744
01:36:56,180 --> 01:36:59,570
But you might be like super wise. That's
the other thing. If you think, if you've,

1745
01:36:59,630 --> 01:37:01,820
if you think of how smart a person is,

1746
01:37:01,821 --> 01:37:05,510
the keep their shit together and they
become like a mature older man who's just

1747
01:37:05,511 --> 01:37:08,420
wise and understands the way
the world works as well read.

1748
01:37:08,421 --> 01:37:12,440
And it really is taking the time to
do the work on themselves personally.

1749
01:37:12,560 --> 01:37:15,350
They know themselves better than they
did when they were young. Foolish man.

1750
01:37:15,470 --> 01:37:18,020
That's hopefully most
of us as we get older.

1751
01:37:18,260 --> 01:37:21,110
But what if you could live 300 years,
how wise would you be done?

1752
01:37:21,140 --> 01:37:23,510
My biggest concern isn't
necessarily about being wise.

1753
01:37:23,511 --> 01:37:27,500
I think it's about my loved ones cause
they gonna Watch. You know what I mean?

1754
01:37:27,500 --> 01:37:30,060
Cause you see a lot in 300 years
you see a lot of shit. Right?

1755
01:37:30,190 --> 01:37:34,250
Like that's like three wives actually
maybe four six and who knows. Right.

1756
01:37:34,360 --> 01:37:35,810
But like as they pass you'd be like,

1757
01:37:35,811 --> 01:37:39,380
you'd have your kids and like your kid
who lived to be like 80 years old and

1758
01:37:39,381 --> 01:37:43,550
you're just like, hey, you know to get
your kid a new body. Yeah. That's more,

1759
01:37:43,551 --> 01:37:45,580
tend to want to go on forever though.
Cause I feel like what?

1760
01:37:45,581 --> 01:37:47,750
What's the world gonna look like
in 300 years? Maybe they don't.

1761
01:37:48,710 --> 01:37:51,470
Maybe it would be the shit. Maybe it
would be, maybe it would I, you know what?

1762
01:37:51,471 --> 01:37:52,130
I've done his name.

1763
01:37:52,130 --> 01:37:55,260
You know what might the most fascinating
thing I keep thinking about is us to

1764
01:37:55,261 --> 01:37:56,094
Mars.

1765
01:37:56,140 --> 01:37:58,680
I know Eli Musk really wants that. Do
you want to go? Would you go? Nope.

1766
01:37:58,980 --> 01:38:01,080
Why not interested? It's a
one way trip. I know. Look,

1767
01:38:01,081 --> 01:38:03,660
I don't want to go to Antarctica.
Really? Fuck what I want to go to Mars.

1768
01:38:03,750 --> 01:38:05,370
I don't want to go anywhere
where people can't live.

1769
01:38:05,920 --> 01:38:09,390
We got to Utah and the woods and shoot
deer. People live there really beautiful.

1770
01:38:09,391 --> 01:38:11,550
The streams and trees.
It's gorgeous.

1771
01:38:11,551 --> 01:38:13,320
But you were just saying that you don't
like when people come up to you at a

1772
01:38:13,321 --> 01:38:17,970
restaurant and harass you. So like you
living alone. Being around people though.

1773
01:38:17,971 --> 01:38:21,570
That's why I go to a restaurant and not
like in a cave somewhere trying to eat.

1774
01:38:22,290 --> 01:38:24,330
You know what I mean? I
mean, there's nothing wrong.

1775
01:38:24,360 --> 01:38:26,380
I feel like you would want to do that.
I feel like what? All this, all this,

1776
01:38:26,650 --> 01:38:30,810
all this manly shit that you do like
men want to just go and just like light

1777
01:38:30,811 --> 01:38:34,200
fires and caves and shit and just
like going to Mars is stupid.

1778
01:38:34,260 --> 01:38:35,280
You can't come back.

1779
01:38:35,580 --> 01:38:38,310
That's like going to the shittiest
neighborhood and the known university.

1780
01:38:38,311 --> 01:38:41,610
You can get to one way. Guess
what your name. Oh yeah,

1781
01:38:41,660 --> 01:38:46,140
we'll live forever without mean shit.
Assholes. No one cares. What's his name?

1782
01:38:46,141 --> 01:38:50,580
Lives forever. Hitler.
Some. Fuck. What are these?

1783
01:38:50,700 --> 01:38:54,240
Is this Elon Musk space station
on Mars neighborhoods sucks.

1784
01:38:54,540 --> 01:38:57,120
That's like living in Barstow
for the rest of your life.

1785
01:38:57,121 --> 01:38:58,020
What do you even see there?

1786
01:38:58,710 --> 01:39:03,390
You get trapped in Barstow in a glass
bubble like halfway to Vegas. Hey,

1787
01:39:03,391 --> 01:39:08,220
remember this? Biosphere Pauly shore?
No, but they did a real one. Oh,

1788
01:39:08,221 --> 01:39:12,840
that's right. We buy the actual
bias. Pauly shore and who else?

1789
01:39:12,841 --> 01:39:16,830
Uh, Stephen Baldwin. Yeah, that's right.
It did. Biosphere that. How did that,

1790
01:39:16,831 --> 01:39:19,860
that didn't go so well. Now
people went crazy. They go crazy.

1791
01:39:19,890 --> 01:39:22,470
Why don't we do that again? People
go crazy, man. You don't want,

1792
01:39:22,471 --> 01:39:24,360
they don't want to be locked
together with each other.

1793
01:39:24,360 --> 01:39:28,320
It's not normal for everybody. We just
stuck in some bubble with each other.

1794
01:39:28,321 --> 01:39:30,240
It's been 25 years since biosphere,

1795
01:39:30,241 --> 01:39:33,750
since eight scientists sealed themselves
in a biosphere for two whole years.

1796
01:39:33,751 --> 01:39:35,100
What ended up happening to them?
I forget.

1797
01:39:35,130 --> 01:39:37,050
They probably went on a fucking rampage.

1798
01:39:37,200 --> 01:39:40,920
Took more than three months just to make
pizza. Why? Really? What does that mean?

1799
01:39:41,590 --> 01:39:45,610
Did they bring her guy prior to Greg?
The ingredients from scratch? Oh,

1800
01:39:46,380 --> 01:39:48,630
of course. Oh yeah. They had a live,

1801
01:39:48,660 --> 01:39:51,720
they had to be sustainable inside that
little ecosystem where they allowed a

1802
01:39:51,721 --> 01:39:53,970
bang each other. How
could, you forbid that?

1803
01:39:54,310 --> 01:39:57,510
How could you tell people want to do in
general, but it's work. Work, environment,

1804
01:39:57,810 --> 01:40:01,830
harassment. Yeah. I guess you're right.
What does he look broken? Who's HR?

1805
01:40:01,831 --> 01:40:03,690
Who's going to stop you?
That's right. Who is HR?

1806
01:40:03,720 --> 01:40:06,690
So there's 25 people in their 25
sciences and that's the thing.

1807
01:40:06,690 --> 01:40:09,470
Do you think that if people,
if we didn't have laws who don't,

1808
01:40:09,480 --> 01:40:12,540
a lot of the society, no police, how
will we just kill each other? Yes.

1809
01:40:12,750 --> 01:40:15,150
Bearings because it didn't
happen. They're like, Oh,

1810
01:40:15,151 --> 01:40:19,250
who was the law there and the bias fit.
I think most of the time we don't even,

1811
01:40:19,520 --> 01:40:20,580
what does it say Jamie?

1812
01:40:20,910 --> 01:40:23,790
Nevertheless a team completed the mission
to merger from the outside world if

1813
01:40:23,791 --> 01:40:26,160
just two years of solitude. Okay. Um,

1814
01:40:26,730 --> 01:40:29,820
I think most of the time
you don't need the law,

1815
01:40:30,060 --> 01:40:35,060
but is that because we know the law exists
and people have formulated society in

1816
01:40:36,331 --> 01:40:40,080
the sense that you could always count on
the laws. So that keeps people in check.

1817
01:40:40,500 --> 01:40:42,780
I don't know.
And it depends on where you live.

1818
01:40:42,781 --> 01:40:47,110
Like if you live in a poverty stricken
crime ridden neighborhoods, right?

1819
01:40:47,310 --> 01:40:50,780
Do you need the law of their more or do
you need the law? They're less like what?

1820
01:40:50,781 --> 01:40:51,450
What is,

1821
01:40:51,450 --> 01:40:56,350
what's is is maybe being arrested a lot
causing some of the problems that you're

1822
01:40:56,351 --> 01:40:57,220
seeing in that neighborhood.

1823
01:40:57,221 --> 01:41:01,140
And there are some of those
arrests because of nonviolent
drug offenses, right?

1824
01:41:01,240 --> 01:41:03,020
Like how much,
how much are you turning mean?

1825
01:41:03,180 --> 01:41:05,830
Cause there is a certain percentage of
people that get turned into criminals

1826
01:41:06,010 --> 01:41:08,500
once they get introduced
into the judicial system.

1827
01:41:08,620 --> 01:41:13,620
As a nonviolent person person who's
deciding the drugs that you're stuck in a

1828
01:41:13,781 --> 01:41:14,850
fucking,
uh,

1829
01:41:15,760 --> 01:41:20,620
full penitentiary with criminals are
real criminals like violent people.

1830
01:41:20,800 --> 01:41:25,330
And then you're just a guy who sells weed.
Oh my God. Fuck. What am I doing here?

1831
01:41:25,360 --> 01:41:30,000
This is why it's real too. This is why we
need to analyze those, uh, isolated, uh,

1832
01:41:30,310 --> 01:41:30,881
environments,

1833
01:41:30,881 --> 01:41:34,540
those isolated ecosystems with people
that's never seen anyone from the outside

1834
01:41:34,541 --> 01:41:37,090
see how they handle shit.
Well, they kill each other.

1835
01:41:38,040 --> 01:41:39,820
They kill people that
don't pull their weight.

1836
01:41:40,120 --> 01:41:42,610
Should we do that both kill the week now?
I don't think so.

1837
01:41:42,700 --> 01:41:45,850
This is a great book sapiens from Noah.

1838
01:41:45,880 --> 01:41:49,780
What does you've all Herati um,
it's a great book but it just,

1839
01:41:49,840 --> 01:41:54,840
it outlines the history of the human
race and these various tribes that have

1840
01:41:55,660 --> 01:41:58,930
dealt with like weird shit like that.
Like there's,

1841
01:41:58,931 --> 01:42:02,230
there's certain tribes that like when
they see like old ladies that are moving

1842
01:42:02,231 --> 01:42:06,790
too slow and they just kill him. Damn.
Yeah. And this one guy was talking about,

1843
01:42:06,791 --> 01:42:09,700
I think it was that book, I'm pretty
sure it was the, it was sapiens.

1844
01:42:10,300 --> 01:42:13,240
I read a bunch of books or listened
to, I should say, I don't align,

1845
01:42:13,270 --> 01:42:15,790
listened to him on tape, a bunch of
them back to back on runs, right.

1846
01:42:15,940 --> 01:42:18,510
That we're dealing with this
very same issue. And um,

1847
01:42:19,270 --> 01:42:20,980
there was talking about
this guy who was like,

1848
01:42:21,660 --> 01:42:24,910
he killed a few of his aunts dam and yeah.
And they were like,

1849
01:42:24,970 --> 01:42:27,940
all the old ladies are scared of him
because he was the guy that they hired to

1850
01:42:28,000 --> 01:42:30,450
kill them when they weren't pulling
their own weight. And I'm like, okay,

1851
01:42:30,820 --> 01:42:33,900
but maybe that, is that a bad
thing though, because if you're,

1852
01:42:33,901 --> 01:42:36,730
if you're planning out a few,
that old lady, if that's correct,

1853
01:42:36,940 --> 01:42:39,130
if you're part of an older tribe,
if you've had a tribe, right?

1854
01:42:39,490 --> 01:42:43,000
And you guys have to keep moving and
keeping things going because you're going

1855
01:42:43,001 --> 01:42:46,420
to get killed by another tribe and then
you have a weaker members of that tribe

1856
01:42:46,421 --> 01:42:50,250
that are holding the entire tribe back.
What do you do? What do you do your risky?

1857
01:42:50,251 --> 01:42:52,850
I mean, do you, that's the real question.
Would you, would you, would you know,

1858
01:42:52,851 --> 01:42:54,880
would you put a bullet in,
you know,

1859
01:42:54,910 --> 01:42:58,300
your friend's mom because she wasn't
pulling her weight and because that,

1860
01:42:58,301 --> 01:43:01,570
that depends on the entire tribe itself.
She's throwing the whole tribe down.

1861
01:43:02,170 --> 01:43:05,980
See we, that's the thing that you do
when you don't have much. Right. Right.

1862
01:43:06,190 --> 01:43:09,280
When you have surplus like
we have, we, we value,

1863
01:43:09,281 --> 01:43:12,470
our older people want to care for them.
Right. Like, and [inaudible] and stuff.

1864
01:43:12,600 --> 01:43:15,640
Yeah. Like there's a, there's a
famous video of these two comedians.

1865
01:43:15,641 --> 01:43:16,211
You seen that video?

1866
01:43:16,211 --> 01:43:19,060
There's two comedians and find this
lady who's trying to buy gas with like

1867
01:43:19,061 --> 01:43:22,540
pennies and shit and they give her money
and she starts crying. It's a tear.

1868
01:43:22,541 --> 01:43:25,720
Jerker it's a serious tear.
Jerker but what happens in the video?

1869
01:43:25,780 --> 01:43:28,460
They give her money. They find
some lady. Yeah. They just,

1870
01:43:28,530 --> 01:43:32,390
they just use two young guys get
out and give this lady money and,

1871
01:43:32,570 --> 01:43:35,120
and she starts crying and
they just, gas station. Yeah.

1872
01:43:35,680 --> 01:43:36,640
It's like five bucks a gallon.

1873
01:43:36,641 --> 01:43:39,360
I actually used to private pain with
like pennies and shit. She's just like,

1874
01:43:39,430 --> 01:43:44,140
she's, yeah. And so they give her some
money and she's, she's like weeping,

1875
01:43:44,160 --> 01:43:48,580
you know, it's really, she, her husband
died just a week ago. Yeah. It's like,

1876
01:43:48,581 --> 01:43:51,440
it's heavy to turn it off. I'm gonna start
crying. Stop it. I want to see you cry.

1877
01:43:51,441 --> 01:43:52,000
[inaudible] don't

1878
01:43:52,000 --> 01:43:55,280
know. Hey, Joel was lost. We cried.
Oh, not that long ago. Really?

1879
01:43:56,080 --> 01:43:59,330
A cry for happy thing. Tell me. Oh really?
Yeah. You don't care for sat stuff.

1880
01:43:59,720 --> 01:44:04,250
Not as much men. Like if
someone does something really
amazing, I'll start saying,

1881
01:44:04,570 --> 01:44:06,420
yeah, you saw my videos. You're like, ugh.

1882
01:44:11,030 --> 01:44:14,510
When people do good things there cry.
Yeah. I get, I tear up for shit like that.

1883
01:44:14,540 --> 01:44:16,550
Gotcha. Yeah. Same here. Yeah.

1884
01:44:17,030 --> 01:44:20,720
I'm not into dudes who cry about like
stupid shit. Yeah, like having too much.

1885
01:44:21,910 --> 01:44:26,910
Oh God got out, man. You know,
if he cry. Well, is it always me?

1886
01:44:28,480 --> 01:44:32,050
That's what happens when you drive
and it says great, empty. You'd dump.

1887
01:44:32,060 --> 01:44:36,020
Fuck Jesus Christ. She bought an eevee.
When do you think it's going to happen?

1888
01:44:36,021 --> 01:44:40,610
That evs are all electrical
like with the solar. Oh,

1889
01:44:40,640 --> 01:44:44,720
not for a while, man. Solar density is
tough because he get a lot of panels.

1890
01:44:44,810 --> 01:44:47,360
But out here house. Yeah,
that's true. Well, he out here,

1891
01:44:47,361 --> 01:44:50,300
I think a lot of people are
rocking it that way. In two steps.

1892
01:44:50,330 --> 01:44:54,050
They get the solar from the roof or from
the panels and then it goes into the

1893
01:44:54,051 --> 01:44:56,750
battery and the battery in the chart.
So a lot of people,

1894
01:44:56,810 --> 01:44:58,040
what they do is they just,

1895
01:44:58,041 --> 01:45:01,730
it's cheaper than just get a whole
bunch of panels and they reduce their

1896
01:45:01,731 --> 01:45:05,180
electricity bill by not having either
the battery pack itself restore the

1897
01:45:05,181 --> 01:45:06,060
electricity.
Right.

1898
01:45:06,290 --> 01:45:09,530
And a lot of the times people don't have
a large enough battery pack in their

1899
01:45:09,531 --> 01:45:12,530
homes to store that energy to charge
their cars. You know what I mean?

1900
01:45:12,531 --> 01:45:16,010
A lot people just have the panels to
offset the price of electricity that feeds

1901
01:45:16,011 --> 01:45:18,320
back into the grid.
But what I mean is the car itself,

1902
01:45:18,321 --> 01:45:20,510
like Fisker had that for
a while where their roof,

1903
01:45:20,890 --> 01:45:24,800
the roof that was powering
the radio. Yeah, it's like a,

1904
01:45:25,280 --> 01:45:27,050
it's like a gimmicky kind of thing.
Again,

1905
01:45:27,590 --> 01:45:32,240
it Kinda is because you're only because
you're very limited in size and amount

1906
01:45:32,241 --> 01:45:33,680
of panels that you could put on the roof.

1907
01:45:34,010 --> 01:45:35,960
It's really only enough
to like trickle charge,

1908
01:45:35,961 --> 01:45:38,630
like a couple of things here and I mean
you need like a bigger array or like

1909
01:45:38,631 --> 01:45:41,900
heavy, uh, solar density
and that's coming.

1910
01:45:41,901 --> 01:45:43,970
But like there's not enough to
really like power the car from it.

1911
01:45:44,390 --> 01:45:45,560
You know what I mean?
While you're driving,

1912
01:45:45,800 --> 01:45:50,550
maybe there's an alternative
way to gather the sun together.

1913
01:45:50,950 --> 01:45:54,620
Raise. Yeah. Because if that would
be the most amazing thing ever,

1914
01:45:54,650 --> 01:45:56,170
if we all had cars that were elected,

1915
01:45:56,390 --> 01:45:59,780
I just ran the sun and there was
no need for oil. It's all done.

1916
01:46:00,450 --> 01:46:04,570
Is that the Fisker Jamie? Yeah. Yeah.
So that solar array on the rooftop,

1917
01:46:04,640 --> 01:46:07,640
I think it powers the radio.
Yeah. So like you have that much,

1918
01:46:07,970 --> 01:46:11,330
you only have so much room on the roof
and all the powers is the radio Rashan

1919
01:46:11,331 --> 01:46:14,510
the motor. Yeah. Reporters. It's
just, it wouldn't even try it.

1920
01:46:14,540 --> 01:46:19,100
That didn't even exist 20 years ago.
So who knows? In the future that would,

1921
01:46:19,400 --> 01:46:21,560
it seems like it could be possible.

1922
01:46:21,630 --> 01:46:24,830
You could figure out a way to make
it efficient and especially out here.

1923
01:46:25,310 --> 01:46:27,840
There's a ton of sun
out here. Yeah. Just be,

1924
01:46:27,880 --> 01:46:30,020
that would be the most amazing thing
on the roof. I don't understand that.

1925
01:46:30,021 --> 01:46:30,854
Trying to be hot bro.

1926
01:46:31,410 --> 01:46:34,430
I'm trying to get some dick look at her
trying to sell cars and it would start

1927
01:46:34,431 --> 01:46:38,210
with the glasses. She's looks really Pale
too. She's going to burst into frames.

1928
01:46:38,280 --> 01:46:41,960
Is that share share a little bit.
That's shares fetus.

1929
01:46:43,310 --> 01:46:47,030
Yeah. Yeah. Um, I mean I
think that would be, uh,

1930
01:46:47,150 --> 01:46:50,310
that would really be the future.
We had no reliance

1931
01:46:50,370 --> 01:46:52,710
whatsoever on oil to be bad ass man.

1932
01:46:52,711 --> 01:46:55,140
What do you think about
sticking over alliance?

1933
01:46:55,141 --> 01:46:58,320
What do you think about people no longer
relying on driving their own cars?

1934
01:46:58,321 --> 01:47:00,420
What do you think of everyone
owned a Tesla, right?

1935
01:47:00,720 --> 01:47:04,050
Hold that worth look like everyone put
an autopilot when they went somewhere.

1936
01:47:04,230 --> 01:47:06,090
Like what would that look like?
Go you, you've used autopilot,

1937
01:47:06,091 --> 01:47:07,410
but you can be out on the
wheel because you're nervous.

1938
01:47:07,770 --> 01:47:09,510
I think in one day it's
going to be amazing,

1939
01:47:09,780 --> 01:47:14,780
but I think it's like if
you bought windows 95 if I
bought a computer in 95 and

1940
01:47:15,051 --> 01:47:17,760
he had windows, it would crash all the
time. You get that blue screen of death,

1941
01:47:17,790 --> 01:47:21,990
right? It doesn't always work. No. But
you can rely on like windows 10 does not.

1942
01:47:21,991 --> 01:47:23,730
I've never had a crash. Not once. Yeah.

1943
01:47:24,330 --> 01:47:26,610
I think that that's what it's
going to be like with a Tesla.

1944
01:47:27,030 --> 01:47:29,630
I think this is going to be a few
crashes. Yeah, of course. If you,

1945
01:47:29,720 --> 01:47:32,160
everyone's driving these things
just going to be hiccups, errors,

1946
01:47:32,161 --> 01:47:36,260
software problems, glitches. Some
people are just dumb acids. Yeah.

1947
01:47:36,540 --> 01:47:40,950
But then after a while it's just going to
work. You know? Like if you look at the,

1948
01:47:41,570 --> 01:47:45,210
like we were talking about windows
or or a android versus apple.

1949
01:47:45,211 --> 01:47:49,650
The old android was dog shit. It was
terrible. But I have a new, a note nine,

1950
01:47:49,651 --> 01:47:53,730
a galaxy note nine an android guy. No,
I both, he both of everything. Yeah.

1951
01:47:53,820 --> 01:47:56,580
I like to fuck with Shit. Yeah. That's
why I mentioned junior. So we'll say,

1952
01:47:56,581 --> 01:47:59,770
what do you use two phones? What do you
need to you drug dealer work? Yes. Yeah.

1953
01:47:59,870 --> 01:48:01,350
Okay. Um, one,

1954
01:48:01,380 --> 01:48:06,320
one number I give to people
who are squirrelly or
anything suspect. Yeah. Yeah.

1955
01:48:06,330 --> 01:48:09,090
Like I have to, you know, I'll
turn it on every now and then.

1956
01:48:09,091 --> 01:48:12,540
Check texts and she's this fucking
guy. Yeah. And then the other,

1957
01:48:12,980 --> 01:48:17,180
would you give me one, give me the real
interesting. Give you the iPhone. Nice.

1958
01:48:17,190 --> 01:48:19,960
It comes up blue. If you get a green text
from me, you know you're on the squad.

1959
01:48:22,970 --> 01:48:26,670
Everyone text Joe Right now. I'd be like,
Hey, listen, what's his bubble showing up?

1960
01:48:26,671 --> 01:48:30,480
I like the idea of supporting
a alternative platforms.

1961
01:48:30,690 --> 01:48:34,620
That's one of the reasons
why I'm, I appreciate windows
and I appreciate Android,

1962
01:48:35,370 --> 01:48:38,610
but I think that apple has a better
platform. It's this a better ecosystem.

1963
01:48:39,060 --> 01:48:43,350
I just, I despise their lack of options
with their laptops. I despise it.

1964
01:48:43,351 --> 01:48:45,120
I think it's, it's, it's,

1965
01:48:46,860 --> 01:48:51,860
it's unfathomable how such an enormous
company can have such shit things to type

1966
01:48:52,351 --> 01:48:56,100
on when they cater to creative people.
Yeah. It's their way or the highway.

1967
01:48:56,250 --> 01:48:58,590
This is how it is and that's kind of it.
I didn't want to have one at home.

1968
01:48:58,591 --> 01:49:01,010
I have a mechanical keyboard.
You like love them.

1969
01:49:01,930 --> 01:49:05,050
Clickety you customize those at all?
Nope. Do you spec it out and make can oh,

1970
01:49:05,060 --> 01:49:09,660
super sweet. And I use a razor
razor. Um, once it's a gaming one,

1971
01:49:10,020 --> 01:49:13,890
I use it for a Thai thing. I never
use mechanical keyboard as a tech guy.

1972
01:49:13,891 --> 01:49:15,450
I'm embarrassed with me.
I had never used one.

1973
01:49:15,451 --> 01:49:18,210
I just use like the lap belt
in laptop one. There's a,

1974
01:49:18,230 --> 01:49:21,750
what are the benefits of it?
I, I'm a feedback person.

1975
01:49:21,751 --> 01:49:25,800
I like tactile feedback. Yeah. I like
the, I like the click. I like to feel it.

1976
01:49:26,280 --> 01:49:29,040
And uh, the same reason why
I like a manual transmission.

1977
01:49:29,130 --> 01:49:31,830
Same reason why I like mechanical thing.

1978
01:49:31,860 --> 01:49:34,840
Maybe you should get a phone that has
buttons on it. I should like one of those.

1979
01:49:35,250 --> 01:49:38,790
Remember those t mobile sidekicks,
like the foot phones and stuff like that.

1980
01:49:38,791 --> 01:49:43,050
That's the Shit, man. People had
those, those jealous. Yeah. Um,

1981
01:49:43,080 --> 01:49:44,130
what about um,

1982
01:49:44,190 --> 01:49:47,980
people that can still type with just
the key pad when they have to do four

1983
01:49:47,980 --> 01:49:49,800
presses to gain mass?
Yeah.

1984
01:49:49,810 --> 01:49:52,450
This is a lot of people out there still
rolled Nokia's that you pressed like

1985
01:49:52,451 --> 01:49:56,080
three, eight times to get to the e
and stuff like that. Or playing snake.

1986
01:49:56,081 --> 01:49:59,800
We're minute game snake. There it is.
There's a side call. Damn right it back.

1987
01:49:59,950 --> 01:50:03,770
No they didn't. Yes. Is that
what this is? What year is this?

1988
01:50:03,780 --> 01:50:06,850
Didn't bring that back. This is coming
back. That's bullshit. I don't know.

1989
01:50:06,851 --> 01:50:09,240
How popular is this for sale right now?
What,

1990
01:50:09,250 --> 01:50:11,350
what version of t mobile website is this?
There's no way.

1991
01:50:11,380 --> 01:50:15,640
This is from like 1986 still as
sidekicks, bro. Get sidekicks.

1992
01:50:16,000 --> 01:50:19,140
It says four g.
So it is world we live in,

1993
01:50:19,150 --> 01:50:22,660
in what do you want and who's getting it?
Who's going to buy that?

1994
01:50:23,650 --> 01:50:26,560
Joey's why that Paris Hilton's got one.
Let's just get a pink key.

1995
01:50:26,880 --> 01:50:30,730
What's that pink key four. Is that
enter go back in time? Yeah. Right.

1996
01:50:31,060 --> 01:50:32,980
Shift time warp the fuck man.

1997
01:50:32,981 --> 01:50:35,770
So that's like a Twitter feed that
someone's looking at it on their sidekick.

1998
01:50:35,950 --> 01:50:36,581
However,
you know what?

1999
01:50:36,581 --> 01:50:41,200
I will admit it was a struggle for me to
go from the physical typing keyboard to

2000
01:50:41,201 --> 01:50:44,230
the actual me to touch pat. It was
hard. I didn't want to let it go.

2001
01:50:44,350 --> 01:50:48,010
I was blackberries bitch for a little
while longer than I should have.

2002
01:50:48,740 --> 01:50:52,740
You have one now? No. No. Draw
something I gave up on it, but you have,

2003
01:50:52,820 --> 01:50:55,960
you have any buttons? Does what's that?
Tom Segura is all about that blackberry.

2004
01:50:55,990 --> 01:50:59,740
He's real shitting you. Do you not know
that there Joe? I know those things exist.

2005
01:50:59,741 --> 01:51:00,970
Those dumb don't like,
don't use this as well.

2006
01:51:00,971 --> 01:51:04,150
They have the ones that will
have the physical keyboard
attached to a big screen.

2007
01:51:04,430 --> 01:51:08,860
You've seen that? I think it does it slide
down. Yeah. Those are like all android.

2008
01:51:08,890 --> 01:51:11,220
Those are all android power now,
I think. Right and yes. Yeah.

2009
01:51:11,260 --> 01:51:15,860
All the blackboards or how about
a windows phone? Ooh, yeah, right.

2010
01:51:16,450 --> 01:51:20,020
That kind of faded into obscurity
matrix phone. That's that.

2011
01:51:20,021 --> 01:51:23,620
They clicked it and it's the mouthpiece
like slid down and everyone was super

2012
01:51:23,621 --> 01:51:26,640
pumped like, oh that bad. That looks bad.
Ass can't wait till that comes out. No.

2013
01:51:26,641 --> 01:51:27,010
Came out.

2014
01:51:27,010 --> 01:51:29,770
They made a couple of them just cause
people [inaudible] they're like 5,000

2015
01:51:29,771 --> 01:51:33,250
bucks or something. Windows phones.
It's weird that that didn't take off.

2016
01:51:33,251 --> 01:51:35,050
Like a friend of mine had one
of those. I was like, look,

2017
01:51:35,190 --> 01:51:39,070
she didn't have those weird tiles. The
tiles like windows 10 right, exactly.

2018
01:51:39,080 --> 01:51:41,680
Tiles are awkward. They're
still awkward. For me, I'm like,

2019
01:51:41,681 --> 01:51:45,730
this is not the way to do it. If you have
a windows phone now, what are you doing?

2020
01:51:45,820 --> 01:51:48,610
You're fucked. Like you don't
get them anymore. You're like,

2021
01:51:48,611 --> 01:51:51,680
you're not getting updates. Right. Ain't
getting shit. They're just letting it die.

2022
01:51:51,681 --> 01:51:56,260
I kind of just stuck in 1996 track.
What does this Jamie, that matrix phone,

2023
01:51:56,720 --> 01:52:01,540
that same release last year. Ooh, look at
that guy. He's so excited. I lost a slide.

2024
01:52:01,541 --> 01:52:04,850
Yeah, that's like the old school.
It had a slider phone. Oh,

2025
01:52:04,990 --> 01:52:07,600
you think you have a cooler? Stupid
with that thing. Stupid. Yeah.

2026
01:52:07,830 --> 01:52:12,760
So which doing guy get yourself took a
banana. Get a real phone. Fucking Dork.

2027
01:52:13,420 --> 01:52:17,050
But it does have the keypad. Well, you
have to do that shit back to doing that.

2028
01:52:17,060 --> 01:52:21,190
Assholes. Some assholes like t nine
texting was pretty fast that you're cocky.

2029
01:52:21,191 --> 01:52:22,000
Prick.

2030
01:52:22,000 --> 01:52:26,590
Shut mouth 13 I forgot
how to do it for God.

2031
01:52:26,591 --> 01:52:31,110
I never knew. I never knew ways that
touchscreen as well. Oh God, I hope it is.

2032
01:52:31,970 --> 01:52:36,490
This is just
navigate with that stupid thing.

2033
01:52:36,640 --> 01:52:39,340
I hope this doesn't succeed. Probably
got snake on the truck. Yeah,

2034
01:52:39,470 --> 01:52:43,120
I think it was the shit. Right? I'm a
snake. The snake. Is that a game game? Oh,

2035
01:52:43,150 --> 01:52:46,070
old old old games.
I have avoided games on

2036
01:52:46,070 --> 01:52:49,790
my phone for a very specific reason why
I have a problem with games like you got

2037
01:52:49,791 --> 01:52:52,490
you got, you got hooked on it. Yeah. You
have a bad ass gaming rig over there.

2038
01:52:52,491 --> 01:52:54,860
I saw that gaming rig,
the game room, the land,

2039
01:52:54,861 --> 01:52:57,980
but that's all for first person
shooters while we're here. Okay.

2040
01:52:58,020 --> 01:53:02,900
Not have a game that I love on my
phone. Why? Because I'm a child.

2041
01:53:02,930 --> 01:53:05,720
Yeah, you get obsessed with it. I
don't have that kind of control.

2042
01:53:05,920 --> 01:53:09,680
I have a fucking awesome game. It's
on my phone. Yeah, that's my life.

2043
01:53:09,681 --> 01:53:12,470
My life's gone now. You go get
the game on me. Everywhere I go.

2044
01:53:12,500 --> 01:53:15,170
What apps do you have on your phone?
They would ask what does keep you going?

2045
01:53:15,620 --> 01:53:19,940
I have a bunch of um,
normal apps like Instagram and Twitter,

2046
01:53:20,450 --> 01:53:24,140
but I have a bunch of cool ones.
Like some star map shit. What do you,

2047
01:53:24,141 --> 01:53:25,040
I've never looked for this,

2048
01:53:25,041 --> 01:53:29,300
but I just found someone playing
quake on their phone. Oh yeah.

2049
01:53:29,490 --> 01:53:32,360
Now joking with that.
Is that an Xbox controller?

2050
01:53:32,580 --> 01:53:35,840
It's sorta like that as a controller
you can expand your dope shit.

2051
01:53:35,841 --> 01:53:38,720
But they played, they have quake
three port it on there. God Damn it.

2052
01:53:39,560 --> 01:53:41,220
See why the fuck you telling me that?

2053
01:53:41,230 --> 01:53:44,270
Whenever I looked before it son of a
bitch and I think it was two dimensional

2054
01:53:44,271 --> 01:53:47,220
though, or not two d but it
didn't have an up and down. Yeah,

2055
01:53:47,310 --> 01:53:49,950
that does addiction now.
Congratulations on your new addiction.

2056
01:53:50,250 --> 01:53:53,370
I'm not going to do it. I don't have
anything on my phone. I don't even have,

2057
01:53:53,550 --> 01:53:56,240
I had chest on my phone for a little
while and I didn't even like that.

2058
01:53:56,300 --> 01:53:58,630
Yeah cause I was started going,
hmm, how do we get better at this?

2059
01:53:58,650 --> 01:53:59,510
I'm like shut them.
Try.

2060
01:54:00,010 --> 01:54:02,770
Then I had to just shut it off and
we put that God damn thing down.

2061
01:54:02,820 --> 01:54:05,900
You have to pick and choose what you
want to devote your time and energy. So,

2062
01:54:05,901 --> 01:54:06,271
so what do you,

2063
01:54:06,271 --> 01:54:10,190
what are your top three things that you
put time and interest to that aren't

2064
01:54:10,191 --> 01:54:14,060
your family right now? Well work stuff.
It's mostly work stuff or martial arts,

2065
01:54:14,061 --> 01:54:17,090
right?
So it's like work stuff is a stand up,

2066
01:54:17,180 --> 01:54:21,350
which is the most time consuming because
I have multiple sets tonight and I'm

2067
01:54:21,351 --> 01:54:25,550
always writing and there was tweaking
and listening. How do you do it?

2068
01:54:25,551 --> 01:54:28,960
Your standup stuff. So I want to this
shit. You want to get into stand up?

2069
01:54:29,200 --> 01:54:31,490
Not really well thinking about it. I
was kinda thinking about it. You do it.

2070
01:54:31,540 --> 01:54:32,660
How do I get into stand up comedy?

2071
01:54:33,560 --> 01:54:35,690
People watch my videos like while
you're kind of funny, you're funny.

2072
01:54:35,690 --> 01:54:38,180
You should do stand up now. I was like,
Shit, I'll trust me. I'm a professional.

2073
01:54:38,181 --> 01:54:39,650
You're funny. God, you
could totally do it.

2074
01:54:39,940 --> 01:54:43,700
All you have to do is go to an open mic
night. Really? Yeah. What? I see Jess,

2075
01:54:43,790 --> 01:54:46,610
go to an open mic night and see
how terrible everybody is. Right?

2076
01:54:46,730 --> 01:54:50,000
And then you'll be inspired to truck.
You're going to be terrible too.

2077
01:54:50,001 --> 01:54:52,040
Don't get me wrong.
I was terrible when I first started,

2078
01:54:52,190 --> 01:54:56,180
but you'll probably be better than most.
Really? Yeah, and that's all you need.

2079
01:54:56,210 --> 01:55:00,200
All you need is people. If you say
something, people that Ah, ah, ah,

2080
01:55:00,380 --> 01:55:03,390
just that's all you need, right? Just a
little chunk. One guy in the front row,

2081
01:55:04,670 --> 01:55:05,480
I got an ember,

2082
01:55:05,480 --> 01:55:08,130
like I can do this and you'll figure it
out and you'll get better at it and you

2083
01:55:08,150 --> 01:55:11,450
work at it and you'll tweak it.
How old are you? 36 you can do it.

2084
01:55:11,540 --> 01:55:16,160
You still have time. He's still alive once
a cutoff date. 40 Shit. Kill yourself.

2085
01:55:19,100 --> 01:55:22,580
I don't mean that. Don't listen to
gone. You'll never be any jokes, folks.

2086
01:55:22,581 --> 01:55:26,790
Just Joe's kidding JK. But if you, if
you're a person who can make people, uh,

2087
01:55:27,230 --> 01:55:29,570
and you are willing to
dedicate yourself to it,

2088
01:55:29,571 --> 01:55:33,310
it's not like you have to have certain
amount of flexibility or you know,

2089
01:55:33,500 --> 01:55:35,240
certain amount of physical
strength, right? No,

2090
01:55:35,241 --> 01:55:38,510
it's just can you make people laugh?
Right. Okay. Then you can do it.

2091
01:55:38,870 --> 01:55:41,240
Are you going to pull it off?
Right. That's another question.

2092
01:55:41,241 --> 01:55:44,160
So how do you get inspiration? How do
you, so you sit down and like, yeah,

2093
01:55:44,161 --> 01:55:46,560
this is funny. Now write this though.
How do you get inspiration for that?

2094
01:55:47,130 --> 01:55:51,750
I think it's, you have to be
what I would call a professional,

2095
01:55:51,960 --> 01:55:56,130
and this is a, I've gotten
this from Steven Pressfield
who wrote the war of art,

2096
01:55:56,131 --> 01:56:00,660
which is a great book and I'm also got
it from reading Stephen King on writing

2097
01:56:00,870 --> 01:56:05,320
and talking to a lot of different writers
about how they handle things. Right?

2098
01:56:05,370 --> 01:56:08,700
If you just waited to be inspired
and that's the only time you wrote,

2099
01:56:09,240 --> 01:56:13,290
you wouldn't have half as much shit.
Right? Not even close, written,

2100
01:56:13,470 --> 01:56:16,890
not even close.
Half as much good material as you do.

2101
01:56:16,920 --> 01:56:19,320
If you decide I'm going to write.

2102
01:56:19,880 --> 01:56:24,000
So I sit down and I write and sometimes
I don't know what the fuck to write

2103
01:56:24,001 --> 01:56:27,180
about and I just started writing.
I just start rambling and a lot of the,

2104
01:56:27,181 --> 01:56:30,660
like the first 20 minutes might be total
horse shit that doesn't get me anywhere.

2105
01:56:30,790 --> 01:56:34,400
But then I got an idea, what about
that? Well, why the fuck do we do that?

2106
01:56:34,620 --> 01:56:37,530
And then I'll start writing about that.
Well this is, and I'll make things up.

2107
01:56:37,560 --> 01:56:40,620
I'll make up a fact, right? And then
I'll argue against that fact, right?

2108
01:56:40,621 --> 01:56:44,550
And then maybe I'll find out what the
real fact is and see if I can argue that

2109
01:56:44,551 --> 01:56:47,580
way. And then I'll, I'll, I'll,
and then I'll, and I'll give up.

2110
01:56:47,670 --> 01:56:50,520
I get to like 1700 words, something
like that. I'll shut the laptop and go,

2111
01:56:50,521 --> 01:56:52,630
what the fuck am I doing?
How do you know that you're not going to,

2112
01:56:52,720 --> 01:56:56,490
a common thing is when
comedians steal jokes scenario.

2113
01:56:56,670 --> 01:56:58,530
So when you're writing and you're like,
yeah,

2114
01:56:58,531 --> 01:56:59,940
I'm going to do this as awesome idea.

2115
01:57:00,120 --> 01:57:04,830
How do you know that that content
already hasn't been a fan been discussed?

2116
01:57:04,860 --> 01:57:08,000
Well, you always, you don't always, um,

2117
01:57:08,100 --> 01:57:11,160
you could absolutely write something
and have parallel thinking,

2118
01:57:11,190 --> 01:57:13,780
write something and not even know that
someone's already written it. But you,

2119
01:57:14,130 --> 01:57:17,700
there's a difference between that and
stealing. Like, you know when someone's,

2120
01:57:17,760 --> 01:57:22,260
like, if you come up with,
if you look at something,

2121
01:57:22,410 --> 01:57:26,640
whatever it is, like I'm saying,
maybe you, your wife sends you to, uh,

2122
01:57:27,480 --> 01:57:31,450
to the grocery store to pickup
some tampons, right? And it has a,

2123
01:57:31,530 --> 01:57:35,790
the price things all fucked up. And so
the guy has to yell price tag on a Tampon,

2124
01:57:35,810 --> 01:57:36,643
check on time.

2125
01:57:36,990 --> 01:57:41,490
There has been like a hundred
Christ done bits on that, right?

2126
01:57:41,520 --> 01:57:45,180
And it's not that they're stealing,
they probably didn't hear anybody do it.

2127
01:57:45,660 --> 01:57:48,660
They thought it was funny. They
thought it up themselves and they did.

2128
01:57:48,661 --> 01:57:52,050
Or maybe it even happen to them. Right?
He did it. That's parallel thinking.

2129
01:57:52,230 --> 01:57:53,570
It's a common one.
Right?

2130
01:57:53,580 --> 01:57:55,920
And then there's other people that did
hear someone do it and they stole it.

2131
01:57:56,340 --> 01:57:58,160
That's a different thing.
That's the worst. Right?

2132
01:57:58,590 --> 01:58:01,590
But you could get both of those
things from that same subject. Right.

2133
01:58:01,591 --> 01:58:04,180
That same really common. Easy
to think of subject. Right.

2134
01:58:04,230 --> 01:58:06,660
There's a lot of those with cops
and donuts. There's a lot of,

2135
01:58:06,870 --> 01:58:09,600
there's a lot of things that
are like a part of the lexicon.

2136
01:58:09,600 --> 01:58:12,180
They're like a part of,
they're part of the way we talk.

2137
01:58:12,220 --> 01:58:15,420
There are a part of culture and you
could think you thought them up,

2138
01:58:15,421 --> 01:58:17,510
but you didn't. It's almost like
Seinfeld in a way. It's like, Shit,

2139
01:58:17,550 --> 01:58:20,940
I should happen to everyone.
Sure. Right. Sure. Um,

2140
01:58:21,090 --> 01:58:23,370
but then there's stuff
that's clearly yours.

2141
01:58:23,760 --> 01:58:28,500
Like if you did a whole bit
about how you built a Tesla,

2142
01:58:28,530 --> 01:58:30,430
right. You know, and that you think,

2143
01:58:30,450 --> 01:58:33,330
and then you've got paranoid heavy hitter
and you thought Ilan Musk is plotting

2144
01:58:33,331 --> 01:58:37,020
against you. You could. And that
that's something we do that.

2145
01:58:37,110 --> 01:58:40,980
And that would be something that's
wholly unique to you. I mean,

2146
01:58:41,050 --> 01:58:42,040
many fucking people

2147
01:58:42,040 --> 01:58:46,900
have built a Tesla. Is there even 20 on
the earth height? I at this point, yeah,

2148
01:58:46,901 --> 01:58:49,450
probably.
Maybe 20 let's pretend.

2149
01:58:49,750 --> 01:58:54,750
Let's pretend that out of 7 billion
plus population of human beings,

2150
01:58:55,270 --> 01:58:58,210
maybe 20 people who have done what
you've done, but doesn't it get old?

2151
01:58:58,211 --> 01:59:02,210
Bill does that one bit. I can't,
but you can. The same sauce.

2152
01:59:02,700 --> 01:59:04,750
Are you just talking about
other things then? Right?

2153
01:59:04,751 --> 01:59:08,950
Like you could talk about anything that
you find interesting. Personal Shit,

2154
01:59:08,980 --> 01:59:13,840
technology, world events, worrying about
the environment. You know all this.

2155
01:59:14,050 --> 01:59:16,600
Anything. Yeah. Did that whale
really have a bomb strapped? Right.

2156
01:59:16,630 --> 01:59:19,920
I keep thinking about that over and over.
Why not? Yeah, I mean, and then if you,

2157
01:59:20,140 --> 01:59:24,660
maybe it was like someone from CNN
that fucking hates the Russians, right?

2158
01:59:24,790 --> 01:59:27,160
You know, like wanting to blame everything
on the rush and it's like, yeah,

2159
01:59:27,180 --> 01:59:32,180
they got duped for two years saying that
there was collusion and that Trump was

2160
01:59:32,891 --> 01:59:33,580
going down.

2161
01:59:33,580 --> 01:59:36,610
They colluded with Russia and then it
turns out that the Mueller report doesn't

2162
01:59:36,880 --> 01:59:39,460
really necessarily say that.
And then they're like, fuck,

2163
01:59:39,461 --> 01:59:41,460
we got to do something that got
these Goddamn Russians. Yeah.

2164
01:59:41,520 --> 01:59:45,730
So they hired this whale and
they put a strap on. That was,

2165
01:59:45,870 --> 01:59:49,690
that allows a good story. Shit. I've
got a bad cough. So, so that that,

2166
01:59:49,691 --> 01:59:52,990
that you write all this stuff down, right?
You're right. Like you know, 1700 words,

2167
01:59:52,991 --> 01:59:56,090
2000 words out of that I
might get one line. Really.

2168
01:59:56,380 --> 01:59:59,980
So how do you memorize that style or
write it down and then I take it and I

2169
01:59:59,981 --> 02:00:04,900
extract it and a lot of it, I put in
notes on my phone. On Your iPhone.

2170
02:00:05,090 --> 02:00:08,230
It's one of the reason why I like the
iPhone ones because when I write something

2171
02:00:08,231 --> 02:00:12,550
in notes, they all show up
automatically. It's all sink.

2172
02:00:12,551 --> 02:00:15,760
But I also have a thing called Evernote.
And so Evernote,

2173
02:00:15,900 --> 02:00:18,720
Oh you do have apps?
So I,

2174
02:00:18,730 --> 02:00:21,250
so I transfer everything into both.

2175
02:00:21,610 --> 02:00:26,260
So one goes into Evernote and then one
copy of it goes into notes sometimes not

2176
02:00:26,320 --> 02:00:29,020
like right now I'm a little behind on
Evernote because I've been using just the

2177
02:00:29,021 --> 02:00:33,280
Mac laptop for the last couple of weeks.
Yeah. Damn. Yeah. So that's how I do it.

2178
02:00:33,650 --> 02:00:38,430
I go back and forth and you keep reading
it and then I write it out on paper and

2179
02:00:38,440 --> 02:00:42,580
the write it down on paper part is really
more just to highlight it and so I met,

2180
02:00:42,581 --> 02:00:44,440
remember what the key points are.
Right.

2181
02:00:44,620 --> 02:00:49,620
I don't necessarily write it out in
full like I look at what I wrote out and

2182
02:00:50,471 --> 02:00:52,030
then I say, okay, I know
where I'm trying to go.

2183
02:00:52,150 --> 02:00:56,110
Let me just try to go there organically.
Right. So there's one time I did a,

2184
02:00:56,111 --> 02:00:59,380
I did a speech in front of about
maybe like 160 people or so.

2185
02:00:59,420 --> 02:01:00,460
I throw some jokes in there,

2186
02:01:00,461 --> 02:01:04,270
which is actually pretty good you
to get that weird thing where you're

2187
02:01:04,300 --> 02:01:08,310
explaining a story and you didn't even
get to the joke yet and then you started

2188
02:01:08,311 --> 02:01:10,240
talking to people are already laughing.
Yeah. I'm like, wait a minute.

2189
02:01:10,300 --> 02:01:12,670
That wasn't supposed to be funny.
Exactly. It was a terrible moment.

2190
02:01:12,671 --> 02:01:14,830
My friend died. Why you laughing?
It's one of those things.

2191
02:01:15,160 --> 02:01:17,930
Sometimes people see where
it's going and they, they,

2192
02:01:17,940 --> 02:01:21,400
they their plan ahead and they start
laughing. Oh my God, I know where this is.

2193
02:01:21,401 --> 02:01:26,350
God. Yeah. They see where he'd go like, Oh
God, is this go, oh shit. Is this going?

2194
02:01:26,351 --> 02:01:28,450
And they start laughing. He
started laughing there. Yeah.

2195
02:01:28,740 --> 02:01:31,780
It's kind of one of those crazy things,
but no, I think, I think I want to try it.

2196
02:01:31,810 --> 02:01:33,760
You should try it because he
wanted to try. You should try it.

2197
02:01:33,970 --> 02:01:38,080
Most of my thing is like going up on
stage and not getting a laugh because I'm

2198
02:01:38,081 --> 02:01:40,880
not saying prick that's in the audience.
Like, wow, this guy's not funny at all.

2199
02:01:40,881 --> 02:01:44,330
It's Jesus. Of course. I have to freaking
stage. We are, we are all that person.

2200
02:01:44,410 --> 02:01:48,440
I mean, look, especially if you don't know
the guy. People love to talk. Shit's fun.

2201
02:01:48,530 --> 02:01:50,840
Yeah. Some guy goes up right in
front of you and said some shit.

2202
02:01:50,860 --> 02:01:55,550
If this guy is no fun lane, you know,
you're like, fuck this car. Yeah,

2203
02:01:56,240 --> 02:01:59,450
that's normal. That's normal. You, uh,

2204
02:02:00,200 --> 02:02:02,840
you're going to have jokes that don't
work and then you're going to have jokes

2205
02:02:02,841 --> 02:02:05,060
at work a lot better than
you thought and be like, wow.

2206
02:02:05,330 --> 02:02:08,590
But just I can tell you thinking about
it and you should do it like here's a

2207
02:02:08,591 --> 02:02:08,990
attorney,

2208
02:02:08,990 --> 02:02:12,050
but you're also thinking about in terms
of like the right way to think about it

2209
02:02:12,051 --> 02:02:14,980
like that your setups are going to
get laughs, right? And then you,

2210
02:02:15,050 --> 02:02:18,400
that's why it's one of the weirdest
things about comedy is that it's sort of t

2211
02:02:18,460 --> 02:02:23,090
it kind of comes to life on
stage, right? On the paper.

2212
02:02:23,091 --> 02:02:25,010
All I'm doing is looking for seeds.

2213
02:02:25,460 --> 02:02:29,480
Like I'm looking for points and seeds
and things that make me chuckle while I'm

2214
02:02:29,481 --> 02:02:31,520
writing it and then I'm
taking into my goes, Hey,

2215
02:02:31,521 --> 02:02:33,230
am I just fucked up or is
this going to be funny?

2216
02:02:33,470 --> 02:02:36,380
And then I try to bring it out on stage
and water it in front of all these

2217
02:02:36,381 --> 02:02:38,000
people. Right. That's
the only way to do it.

2218
02:02:38,001 --> 02:02:40,760
You have to really develop it in front
of people. Do you remember your home,

2219
02:02:40,761 --> 02:02:45,110
your old bits at all? Yeah, there were
terrible. I don't think so. Oh my God.

2220
02:02:45,130 --> 02:02:49,990
The earliest shit was awful. You
weren't there. No, no, no. Sorry.

2221
02:02:49,991 --> 02:02:53,130
The time stuff I've heard like recorded
and stuff. Those good stuff. When I,

2222
02:02:53,360 --> 02:02:58,250
when I'm in my Tesla. Yeah. Uh,
I type in a comedy stations.

2223
02:02:58,600 --> 02:03:00,050
I always come up,
I type in uh,

2224
02:03:00,070 --> 02:03:04,190
Patrice O'Neil and then you come up all
the time in terms of a three year skates,

2225
02:03:04,191 --> 02:03:08,500
bill skates and stuff. Patrice, one
of the greatest of all time for sure.

2226
02:03:08,501 --> 02:03:13,160
100 is a elephant in the room. Those
best thing ever. It's hilarious.

2227
02:03:13,220 --> 02:03:17,240
It's just day. It's awesome man. Yeah.
I just, you know, just a few guys.

2228
02:03:17,241 --> 02:03:21,090
You just wish you could get to that
good. Just clean their health up. Yeah.

2229
02:03:22,070 --> 02:03:25,430
I wish she was here today. He'd
have a lot of cool shit. Oh my God.

2230
02:03:26,080 --> 02:03:27,110
All the time I sit down.
I'm like man,

2231
02:03:27,111 --> 02:03:29,240
it profusely that he has some
cool shit to say about that.

2232
02:03:29,270 --> 02:03:30,440
The closest we have to him.

2233
02:03:30,441 --> 02:03:35,090
Today's really bill burr in terms of
like ballsy stance against political

2234
02:03:35,091 --> 02:03:35,924
correctness,

2235
02:03:36,580 --> 02:03:40,610
but he gets away with it in a way that
other people can't get away with. Yeah.

2236
02:03:40,670 --> 02:03:45,140
It's um, it's sad man.
Yeah, it's, it sucks man,

2237
02:03:45,141 --> 02:03:48,380
because it was a diabetes thing.
It's like, fuck man. Come on man.

2238
02:03:48,381 --> 02:03:50,300
I could have been. I didn't
know him well enough. You know,

2239
02:03:50,301 --> 02:03:53,120
I wasn't hanging out with him.
I was, I was on the west coast.

2240
02:03:53,121 --> 02:03:54,290
He was on the east coast.
Right.

2241
02:03:54,970 --> 02:03:58,140
If I knew him and I would have
tried to talk to him, but you know,

2242
02:03:58,280 --> 02:04:01,370
I tried to talk to Ralphie may
too. That didn't work. People,

2243
02:04:01,371 --> 02:04:03,250
they're on their path.
Yeah.

2244
02:04:03,290 --> 02:04:08,120
Especially comics is the
thing about someone who's
that free like Patrice O'Neil.

2245
02:04:08,150 --> 02:04:11,430
Like he really doesn't give a fuck.
Not Zero. He didn't give a fuck.

2246
02:04:11,470 --> 02:04:12,530
Made hilarious heating a fuck.

2247
02:04:12,531 --> 02:04:15,140
What he said about anything didn't give
a fuck with the 80s are though. Yeah.

2248
02:04:16,370 --> 02:04:19,730
Yeah. Just ate whatever the fuck you
want it did whatever the fuck you want.

2249
02:04:19,731 --> 02:04:23,450
It was indulgent. Yeah. That indulgent
translated to brilliant comedy,

2250
02:04:23,480 --> 02:04:27,830
but it also translated into him not taking
care of his body. Yeah. Just fortunate,

2251
02:04:27,831 --> 02:04:32,750
man. I am. So my big question
for you is what do you, you know,

2252
02:04:32,751 --> 02:04:33,970
you go to a party, right? Right.

2253
02:04:33,980 --> 02:04:36,410
Everyone has that one thing that
they can't stop talking about.

2254
02:04:36,440 --> 02:04:41,040
You have like I have a Tesla, you know,
hey, you know, I do yoga. Like, Hey,

2255
02:04:41,041 --> 02:04:44,790
I'm vegan. What's the one? What's your,
what's your party trick? What, what,

2256
02:04:44,990 --> 02:04:47,610
what's the one thing that you
can't stop talking about? Uh,

2257
02:04:47,611 --> 02:04:49,670
luckily don't have one
because I don't do it really.

2258
02:04:49,770 --> 02:04:53,120
I don't really go to rent parties. If I
do go to parties, those are my kids. Yeah.

2259
02:04:53,160 --> 02:04:54,450
It's like a 30 day parties and shit.

2260
02:04:54,451 --> 02:04:56,970
And then you just talking to parents
and they usually want to ask me UFC

2261
02:04:56,971 --> 02:05:00,810
questions, pair or, or they want to ask
me about like what see you on Musk like,

2262
02:05:00,920 --> 02:05:04,130
or you want to ask me like, what are
you gonna get Kanye on? You know,

2263
02:05:04,131 --> 02:05:05,670
like that kind of shit.
Yeah. What's that? So what's,

2264
02:05:05,700 --> 02:05:09,420
what's that weird thing feel like when
you actually go out in public and like,

2265
02:05:09,421 --> 02:05:11,720
you're actually amongst like
people and stuff, like what,

2266
02:05:11,721 --> 02:05:13,230
what are the most frequent questions?
They ask you?

2267
02:05:13,440 --> 02:05:16,470
Those kinds of questions and it may
stuff, MMA stuff. It's real common.

2268
02:05:16,471 --> 02:05:19,440
Comedy stuff's real calm, not just
stuff. Yeah, they ask weird questions,

2269
02:05:19,441 --> 02:05:22,920
but most the vast majority
of people are cool.

2270
02:05:23,000 --> 02:05:25,740
And the vast majority of people like,
Hey, what's up? Hey, what's going on man?

2271
02:05:25,950 --> 02:05:29,550
It's fine. It's all great. Yeah, it's
all good. If you put that out there,

2272
02:05:29,551 --> 02:05:31,410
like what I put out there,
I'm pretty nice.

2273
02:05:31,530 --> 02:05:34,510
It's like that's what I try to put out
there. So that's what you get back, right?

2274
02:05:34,830 --> 02:05:38,500
So what's next? Now? What's next for Joe
Rodeo? You interviewing me, ma'am? Yeah,

2275
02:05:38,510 --> 02:05:43,080
but yeah, see I told you in the
table you're a natural for this.

2276
02:05:43,380 --> 02:05:46,470
So yeah. So what, what isn't the thing
is, you know that x do it. Just do this.

2277
02:05:46,560 --> 02:05:50,340
But the thing is, I'm
trying to legitimately, I'm
telling you there's no next,

2278
02:05:50,370 --> 02:05:53,250
because you're a successful
person, right. I came in here,

2279
02:05:53,310 --> 02:05:55,890
he pulled up in the black Tusla.
It wasn't salvaged.

2280
02:05:56,040 --> 02:05:58,170
You didn't get it out of the ocean.
I want to learn from you.

2281
02:05:58,770 --> 02:06:01,680
I want to know the things that you do
with the thing is what I did is what

2282
02:06:01,681 --> 02:06:04,650
you're doing right now. I
took my own path. All right.

2283
02:06:04,860 --> 02:06:07,260
That's what you're doing right
now. Yeah, yeah. I mean what,

2284
02:06:07,360 --> 02:06:08,700
what your path is going to be.

2285
02:06:08,770 --> 02:06:11,340
I assume you're going to be doing
more youtube videos I think.

2286
02:06:11,370 --> 02:06:14,040
I'm assuming your channel's going to grow
and I'm assuming you probably going to

2287
02:06:14,041 --> 02:06:16,590
try stand up comedy and probably going
to like it and you probably do a podcast

2288
02:06:16,591 --> 02:06:19,830
to kind of cool cause he got
to the podcast or a podcast.

2289
02:06:19,840 --> 02:06:21,510
You never even done one before.
Tell.

2290
02:06:21,990 --> 02:06:25,050
People don't understand like you're like
how do I put these headphones on? Yeah.

2291
02:06:25,110 --> 02:06:26,120
Like what do I do with them?

2292
02:06:26,121 --> 02:06:28,920
I say what's this black thing in front of
me while you're doing this? Like a pro.

2293
02:06:29,160 --> 02:06:32,460
Yeah. Thank you. I appreciate
you interviewing me. Yeah,
I want to, I want to know,

2294
02:06:32,461 --> 02:06:35,520
I want to learn from you but
see that's how this comfortable,

2295
02:06:35,550 --> 02:06:39,330
easy nature that you have totally
translates into all these things we talked

2296
02:06:39,331 --> 02:06:41,910
about. Okay. Let's give,
can easily do a podcast.

2297
02:06:41,970 --> 02:06:43,830
You could easily do stand up easily.

2298
02:06:43,890 --> 02:06:47,910
100% well standups not as
easy as a piano you ever have.

2299
02:06:47,911 --> 02:06:49,250
Like a new standup person.

2300
02:06:49,270 --> 02:06:51,150
You have to name any names that they
did just sock and you just like,

2301
02:06:51,151 --> 02:06:54,690
why is this guy, this guy's not, shouldn't
be. Yes. Yeah. There's a few that you go,

2302
02:06:54,720 --> 02:06:57,680
Ooh, I gotta get Outta here. Yeah,
I can't be around us. You worried.

2303
02:06:57,681 --> 02:07:00,720
It's contagious. If you watch someone
that's really bad, it's one thing.

2304
02:07:00,780 --> 02:07:03,730
I don't know. Not everybody like Greg
Fitzsimmons thinks it's hilarious. Yeah,

2305
02:07:03,900 --> 02:07:07,200
he loves watching Shitty Comedians.
But if I watch someone who's bombing,

2306
02:07:07,230 --> 02:07:09,780
I got to get the fuck out of the room
cause I started thinking there's nothing

2307
02:07:09,781 --> 02:07:10,820
that's funny.
Really.

2308
02:07:10,830 --> 02:07:14,610
Like things that are funny don't exist
like this is because certain people,

2309
02:07:14,611 --> 02:07:17,730
like if you go to open mic nights, there
are certain people that are just insane.

2310
02:07:17,760 --> 02:07:19,920
Do you still go to open mic
nights? Yeah, I'll stop by. Okay.

2311
02:07:20,010 --> 02:07:21,270
If I'm in the neighborhood,
you know,

2312
02:07:21,271 --> 02:07:23,850
and if I know I want to
peak in like once a year,

2313
02:07:23,970 --> 02:07:26,190
once a year and watch a
little bit just because it's,

2314
02:07:26,940 --> 02:07:30,030
I want to remember what it was like.
That's what you started.

2315
02:07:30,031 --> 02:07:33,550
Now it's the fucking,
the wanting to get on stage.

2316
02:07:33,810 --> 02:07:36,070
Seeing the list of people in the open mic

2317
02:07:36,070 --> 02:07:37,540
night at the comedy store in particular,

2318
02:07:37,541 --> 02:07:40,780
the room is well lit because
they have all the, uh,

2319
02:07:40,810 --> 02:07:43,260
there's these signatures
on the wall of like,

2320
02:07:43,261 --> 02:07:48,050
like Robin Williams and famous comedians
and Sam Kinison and those, those are, um,

2321
02:07:48,100 --> 02:07:52,030
all neon so that when the comedians
are on stage during an open mic night,

2322
02:07:52,031 --> 02:07:54,790
all that neon is on and the
room is kind of fairly well lit.

2323
02:07:55,120 --> 02:07:57,580
And then at the end of the standup
comp, they were like, okay,

2324
02:07:57,960 --> 02:08:01,150
the no more open mic night,
boom, those lights go off,

2325
02:08:01,151 --> 02:08:03,200
the room gets dark and
then the pros go up. Oh.

2326
02:08:03,310 --> 02:08:07,720
And then you see this marked difference
in skill and quality of material and you

2327
02:08:07,721 --> 02:08:09,610
see like real professionals,
you know,

2328
02:08:09,611 --> 02:08:13,560
at Crista Leal go a bill Berg
Chappelle stops in all the time, right?

2329
02:08:13,600 --> 02:08:15,190
Open Mike Nights. Yeah.
They're no joke. Yeah.

2330
02:08:15,360 --> 02:08:20,280
He'll just Chappelle just show up at 11:00
PM just on an open mic night nail up.

2331
02:08:21,220 --> 02:08:22,700
So you get both things.

2332
02:08:22,701 --> 02:08:25,750
So you get to see people that have
no idea what the fuck they're doing.

2333
02:08:25,751 --> 02:08:27,220
You get to see people that have potential,

2334
02:08:27,430 --> 02:08:30,190
they get to see crazy
people that are just insane.

2335
02:08:30,490 --> 02:08:34,090
And then you get to see like worldclass
comedians in the same night. It's a,

2336
02:08:34,091 --> 02:08:38,830
it's a cool experience at
the comedy store, like Monday
nights. Okay. Check it out.

2337
02:08:39,080 --> 02:08:41,500
It's awesome. He used to
be Sunday and Monday. Yeah.

2338
02:08:41,770 --> 02:08:44,890
But then this place started getting
too successful and they cut back on the

2339
02:08:44,891 --> 02:08:49,270
Sunday night. Open mic nights, socks, man.
It, it does suck a little bit. Little bit.

2340
02:08:49,420 --> 02:08:49,780
Yeah.

2341
02:08:49,780 --> 02:08:53,020
So you live in a good spot because
you're in Boston and it's like one of the

2342
02:08:53,021 --> 02:08:55,930
best spots in the world for starting out.
I think I have to try it.

2343
02:08:56,110 --> 02:09:00,250
It's weird cause like I feel weird
because I have a following and it's like,

2344
02:09:00,251 --> 02:09:02,640
hey listen, check me into comedy
because it's like a weird thing.

2345
02:09:02,820 --> 02:09:05,290
They would like it, man. Fuck yeah.

2346
02:09:05,560 --> 02:09:08,440
If I'm a fan of your videos
and I am a fan of your video,

2347
02:09:08,441 --> 02:09:11,470
so if I was a fan of your videos and
I wanted to go see you live at a club,

2348
02:09:11,610 --> 02:09:14,380
which is going to be at this place. Yeah.
Oh Shit. What time? Eight o'clock. Okay,

2349
02:09:14,381 --> 02:09:19,270
let's count. Yeah. You think he's going to
be funny? He was kind of fun. Yeah. Yeah.

2350
02:09:19,540 --> 02:09:22,630
You have a need for people to get a chance
to see the first time you ever go on

2351
02:09:22,631 --> 02:09:27,070
stage too and just be prepared to
eat shit. Yeah. If you do eat shit,

2352
02:09:27,071 --> 02:09:31,000
have some stuff to say about eating shit.
I don't know. I Shit, you'll feel it.

2353
02:09:31,030 --> 02:09:34,960
Yeah. Like oof. Tastes like shit.
Yeah. But yeah, it's definitely shit.

2354
02:09:34,990 --> 02:09:38,560
Thanks for everyone. Have a
good night. Yeah, it's, look,

2355
02:09:38,620 --> 02:09:41,500
I encourage everyone who thinks they
could do it to do it because there's not

2356
02:09:41,501 --> 02:09:45,070
enough of us and there's only, you
know, is it, is it a dying breed?

2357
02:09:45,100 --> 02:09:48,670
It's not a dying breed. No. I think
it's actually on the up right now on,

2358
02:09:48,850 --> 02:09:52,270
I think it's on the upswing quite a bit
because I think there's more avenues.

2359
02:09:52,600 --> 02:09:55,990
There's more clubs to go to.
Comedy is more popular than ever.

2360
02:09:55,991 --> 02:09:58,150
Like if you go to the comedy
store tonight, it's sold out.

2361
02:09:58,420 --> 02:10:00,400
I have a show at the improv
tonight that sold out.

2362
02:10:00,610 --> 02:10:04,530
It's the places that the show tonight
and you're here with me always.

2363
02:10:04,880 --> 02:10:08,710
I work almost every night except Sunday
and Monday. How much do you sleep?

2364
02:10:09,460 --> 02:10:13,830
I sleep a good solid seven hours. What?
Yeah. What's, it isn't hard. Well,

2365
02:10:13,910 --> 02:10:16,300
I just was hard to believe. I
feel like I never, I never sleep.

2366
02:10:16,301 --> 02:10:18,940
I don't know what it is. Don't I got
it. Cause I can't, you know what?

2367
02:10:19,160 --> 02:10:21,400
You're a health guy. Yeah. How
do I get better sleep at night?

2368
02:10:21,460 --> 02:10:24,880
Melatonin release of Melatonin and
keep doing that. They'll forever can I,

2369
02:10:24,881 --> 02:10:28,810
it's not bad for you.
Really? Yeah. Or saunas good.

2370
02:10:28,960 --> 02:10:31,990
Getting a sauna before you go to
bed. It'll, it'll make you feel good.

2371
02:10:31,991 --> 02:10:34,250
I have to have a sauna.
Yeah, that's a problem. Yeah.

2372
02:10:34,670 --> 02:10:37,040
You can get one of them saw on it.
Suits you receive most things, you know?

2373
02:10:37,041 --> 02:10:41,260
And it was like a, like a sleeping
bag, like infrared suit. Really? Yeah.

2374
02:10:41,290 --> 02:10:44,900
They make those. Yeah. Um, so I just
go in like a, it's like a water bed,

2375
02:10:44,901 --> 02:10:48,780
but it's like a bag that I kind of sit
in like a bag, but it's a bag water.

2376
02:10:48,980 --> 02:10:53,780
It's up. It's like kind of heavy and
it heats up and it's like infrared.

2377
02:10:53,781 --> 02:10:55,420
It cooks your body. I think
I'd be too scared to, you know,

2378
02:10:55,580 --> 02:10:58,520
like a Turkey when I got out of that
thing. Think of oil to that bad.

2379
02:10:58,610 --> 02:11:00,020
It's not that bad. Oh, it's really good.

2380
02:11:00,080 --> 02:11:02,240
It makes you feel good when you
get out of it. Yeah. A lot of,

2381
02:11:02,270 --> 02:11:04,910
a lot of people that helps him sleep.
You have that? Like that chamber here,

2382
02:11:04,911 --> 02:11:09,020
that's like a once or deprivation is
that it's an isolation tank. It's,

2383
02:11:09,450 --> 02:11:11,990
I've heard of it. What do
you, what is it? You float?

2384
02:11:12,410 --> 02:11:14,370
The water has a thousand
pounds of Epsom salts. Yep.

2385
02:11:14,450 --> 02:11:19,160
So as he lied down in that salty water,
your, you know, your body floats,

2386
02:11:19,300 --> 02:11:21,800
like half of your body's above the water,
half's under the water.

2387
02:11:21,801 --> 02:11:25,610
So yours are underwater, but everything
above your ears forward on your face.

2388
02:11:25,611 --> 02:11:29,120
Your face. Yeah. Yeah. And then
the water is heated to 94 degrees,

2389
02:11:29,121 --> 02:11:31,130
which is the same temperature
as the surface of your skin.

2390
02:11:31,540 --> 02:11:34,910
And then you shut the door and you're
in total silence. Total darkness.

2391
02:11:34,911 --> 02:11:37,160
You can't see anything.
You open your eyes total blackness.

2392
02:11:37,160 --> 02:11:39,110
That's how close your eyes
and total but terrifying.

2393
02:11:39,140 --> 02:11:41,150
It's not because you could just
open the door anytime you want.

2394
02:11:41,420 --> 02:11:45,380
A lot of people think that like they um,
get claustrophobic. You feels wonderful.

2395
02:11:45,500 --> 02:11:47,450
It feels like,
first of all it feels like you're flying.

2396
02:11:47,570 --> 02:11:50,630
So you lean your arms back and once you
kind of bumped into the walls a little

2397
02:11:50,631 --> 02:11:50,811
bit,

2398
02:11:50,811 --> 02:11:53,810
you've got to center yourself and once
you center yourself and then the water

2399
02:11:53,811 --> 02:11:54,740
stops rippling,

2400
02:11:54,980 --> 02:11:58,010
then he just let your arms relaxed and
they just float and it feels like you're

2401
02:11:58,011 --> 02:12:01,130
flying. You Fall Asleep and die.
My biggest concern right now, no,

2402
02:12:01,190 --> 02:12:03,620
it's only 11 inches of
water and you're floating.

2403
02:12:03,621 --> 02:12:06,200
You can't drown unless he
flipped over face first.

2404
02:12:06,201 --> 02:12:10,640
He started breathing the water.
Please sit up and you're, you're fine.

2405
02:12:10,670 --> 02:12:13,610
There's no way to drown in that.
No one dies. Okay. You're fine.

2406
02:12:14,060 --> 02:12:17,270
You don't have to worry about that and
you floating. It feels great man. Yeah,

2407
02:12:17,420 --> 02:12:19,640
it feels great. It was very
relaxed. So the concentration is,

2408
02:12:19,641 --> 02:12:20,630
tells us what keeps you afloat.

2409
02:12:21,290 --> 02:12:24,390
This is a thousand pounds of
Epson salts in that tank. Wow.

2410
02:12:25,540 --> 02:12:26,373
Good for your skin too.

2411
02:12:26,960 --> 02:12:31,960
I found out about it first
through the movie altered states.

2412
02:12:33,020 --> 02:12:36,530
I had heard about it. It was a
movie that was based loosely, very,

2413
02:12:36,531 --> 02:12:40,400
very loosely on the legend of this guy
named John Lilly and John Lilly's the guy

2414
02:12:40,401 --> 02:12:43,490
who created this sensory deprivation tank.
Do you know where he is? No, I do not.

2415
02:12:43,580 --> 02:12:48,080
Well, he also was a pioneer
in interspecies communication
with dolphins. Yeah,

2416
02:12:48,081 --> 02:12:50,780
he was assigned to, it all comes back
to dolphins at this for this guy,

2417
02:12:50,781 --> 02:12:55,040
he gave dolphins acid. He was a part
of a LSD. Cool. Knows you to do that.

2418
02:12:55,041 --> 02:12:59,260
Who on the fifties and sixties
you get blasted. You know Aramco,

2419
02:12:59,610 --> 02:13:03,500
they actually shut this program
down because the woman that he had,

2420
02:13:03,530 --> 02:13:06,410
he had this woman who was living
with a dolphin and she essentially,

2421
02:13:06,411 --> 02:13:10,790
half of her apartment was underwater like
she was. Her house was half submerged,

2422
02:13:10,791 --> 02:13:14,330
so the Dolphin would come in and out of
the house and sleep with her and then go

2423
02:13:14,331 --> 02:13:17,300
into a tank like her husband or something.
That was the problem.

2424
02:13:17,450 --> 02:13:20,000
She was jerking the dolphin
off. Oh, the dolphin.

2425
02:13:20,001 --> 02:13:22,580
Like it would be distracted all the time,
but the dolphin stayed.

2426
02:13:22,670 --> 02:13:25,830
We'll of course get jerked off all
the time. So they were like, Whoa,

2427
02:13:25,880 --> 02:13:29,690
we're paying for what they were trying to
teach the dolphin to talk. Right, right.

2428
02:13:29,730 --> 02:13:31,620
So they're trying to
teach the dolphin words,

2429
02:13:31,830 --> 02:13:34,410
but the problem was Darwin's
don't have lips. They don't,

2430
02:13:34,440 --> 02:13:36,120
they can't make the deal.
They can make sounds.

2431
02:13:36,121 --> 02:13:39,750
Courts can't make victims what we do. So
they were trying to get it to go how la,

2432
02:13:39,990 --> 02:13:43,140
I was like, ah, a lot of work for
this, a lot of work for hello.

2433
02:13:43,350 --> 02:13:47,730
But it was really obvious that they have
some sort of language and so literally

2434
02:13:47,731 --> 02:13:48,690
who is obsessed with it.

2435
02:13:48,691 --> 02:13:51,870
He would set up a sensory deprivation
tank right outside the dolphin tank and

2436
02:13:51,871 --> 02:13:54,510
take acid and give acid to the dolphins.

2437
02:13:54,660 --> 02:13:56,100
And he was trying to
communicate with them.

2438
02:13:56,110 --> 02:13:59,940
He was trying to communicate with them
like in some sort of a like neighboring

2439
02:13:59,941 --> 02:14:03,210
dimension. Right. He was
a trip. I mean that guy,

2440
02:14:03,211 --> 02:14:07,800
he would take intramuscular ketamine
shooting into his, his meat of his body.

2441
02:14:07,980 --> 02:14:11,640
And then lie in the tank and have these
crazy ketamine trips while he's in the

2442
02:14:11,641 --> 02:14:15,420
tank. Why? Well, I don't know cause
I've never experienced ketamine.

2443
02:14:15,750 --> 02:14:19,590
But apparently there's something about
that particular drug that lends itself

2444
02:14:19,591 --> 02:14:23,010
very well to the sensory deprivation
experience, at least for Lilly.

2445
02:14:23,100 --> 02:14:24,900
And then you've got very
addictive to you about the tank.

2446
02:14:25,460 --> 02:14:30,450
When I heard about that and then I read
a book called the deep self and that was

2447
02:14:30,451 --> 02:14:34,350
a book that Lilli wrote about it.
I think that one each,

2448
02:14:34,390 --> 02:14:37,560
he even had instruction
on how to build a tank.

2449
02:14:37,830 --> 02:14:41,800
He actually had like a set
up, um, like all these uh,

2450
02:14:42,180 --> 02:14:46,320
plans or how you like a blueprint
for how to build your own tank,

2451
02:14:46,660 --> 02:14:49,440
used water bed liners and said
probably pretty easy, right?

2452
02:14:49,441 --> 02:14:51,390
You get a kitty pool through all that.
People have done it.

2453
02:14:51,780 --> 02:14:54,570
People who've done lay down, yeah,
you can do it, but you have, you know,

2454
02:14:54,571 --> 02:14:58,510
you really need, um, is there
a filter at all? Probably not.

2455
02:14:59,670 --> 02:15:04,080
Very heavy duty filtration system. Really.
Yeah, because the one that I have is uh,

2456
02:15:04,130 --> 02:15:07,350
it's a company called the float lab
and the float lab is like the best,

2457
02:15:07,770 --> 02:15:10,020
they make the best tanks
and the guy who makes his,

2458
02:15:10,021 --> 02:15:12,900
my friend crash and he's
like a super scientist dude.

2459
02:15:12,900 --> 02:15:15,690
He's a mad genius when it comes to tanks.

2460
02:15:15,990 --> 02:15:18,670
He's like over engineering everything
and making everything like,

2461
02:15:18,671 --> 02:15:23,070
cause it's like complicated as
I'll show you the whole system.

2462
02:15:23,071 --> 02:15:27,000
It's like all that stuff that's in the
back of it is like essentially from a

2463
02:15:27,001 --> 02:15:30,000
public water purification system.
It's super,

2464
02:15:30,120 --> 02:15:34,830
super heavy duty purification and even
pumps ozone into the water. Oh no shit.

2465
02:15:34,831 --> 02:15:37,620
So what do you do when, so like let's
just say like someone were to go in there,

2466
02:15:37,650 --> 02:15:40,290
right? Yeah. He just had a fight.
Whatever. It may spot. You want to relax,

2467
02:15:40,291 --> 02:15:43,260
you go in there when the person comes
out is does the water change or was it

2468
02:15:43,261 --> 02:15:47,010
just a filtered system with
water to be filtered, but nobody,

2469
02:15:47,400 --> 02:15:51,420
the only people that have been in that
thing or I'm Dan Harris from good morning

2470
02:15:51,421 --> 02:15:53,040
America and me. Really? Yeah.

2471
02:15:53,041 --> 02:15:55,890
He's the only one that ever took me
up on the offer to climb in there.

2472
02:15:55,920 --> 02:15:58,300
Most guys go, yeah, yeah. I'll go
in there and then they go room.

2473
02:15:58,640 --> 02:16:02,220
That's basically what I did.
He's like, you should go. And
I was like, yeah, awesome.

2474
02:16:02,580 --> 02:16:05,520
Love you buddy. Take all your clothes
off and climb into my little tank.

2475
02:16:05,720 --> 02:16:07,980
Literally. Yeah. I was
stripped naked, rich,

2476
02:16:08,000 --> 02:16:10,680
but there's definitely no cameras there.
I worry about that. How do I know that?

2477
02:16:10,681 --> 02:16:14,850
That out of your head? Yeah. Trust me.
I'm going to bed. I guarantee you Boston,

2478
02:16:14,851 --> 02:16:18,000
but Google sensory
deprivation tanks in Boston,

2479
02:16:18,320 --> 02:16:21,750
but guarantee you public
service thing. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2480
02:16:21,870 --> 02:16:24,510
There's a lot of places where you'd
go and you'd rent him and it's like,

2481
02:16:24,511 --> 02:16:27,600
you know, 50 bucks for
an hour or something like
that. That's not bad at all.

2482
02:16:27,840 --> 02:16:29,920
It's worth it, man. There you go. Float

2483
02:16:30,250 --> 02:16:31,420
restoration therapy.

2484
02:16:31,421 --> 02:16:35,790
Where's it that flip Boston discourage
and relaxed and everywhere you go,

2485
02:16:35,890 --> 02:16:40,210
$80 for 90 minutes in
Somerville, in Medford Street.
In Summerville. There you go.

2486
02:16:40,720 --> 02:16:45,370
What if I come out 90 minutes thought
that was a risk, right? Well, I hope not.

2487
02:16:45,640 --> 02:16:48,580
Hope nobody steals your clothes usually
like you're in a room and you get to

2488
02:16:48,581 --> 02:16:52,790
lock it. I'll look shit dude, kids
do it too. It was the kid in there.

2489
02:16:53,260 --> 02:16:55,450
My kids are scared of it.
But yeah,

2490
02:16:55,451 --> 02:16:58,950
they could do it where like they
draw the line with Daddy, what not.

2491
02:16:58,951 --> 02:17:02,140
It shouldn't floating. Wow. Delete.
Bear me. But they won't float.

2492
02:17:02,160 --> 02:17:06,700
You want float too weird. Oh
my God. It feels great man.

2493
02:17:06,701 --> 02:17:07,534
I'm telling you everybody.

2494
02:17:07,630 --> 02:17:11,140
And it's also a great way for your
body to absorb magnesium because the,

2495
02:17:11,141 --> 02:17:13,990
you know, Epsom salt baths are great
when you have sore muscles. Well,

2496
02:17:14,050 --> 02:17:18,140
when you get into this, this
is so much Epsom salts. Yeah.

2497
02:17:18,340 --> 02:17:22,530
You float in it and you, your, your
muscles loosen up and it, it kind of like,

2498
02:17:23,010 --> 02:17:26,560
like all we'll impingements
tight areas loosened.

2499
02:17:26,660 --> 02:17:31,380
I will pod you also looks like a
safe. Yeah. It's much bigger. Yes.

2500
02:17:31,580 --> 02:17:34,910
See this is a cause. You're a two
person tank. No, we want to go.

2501
02:17:34,911 --> 02:17:36,860
You can't go with another person.
Right. That will be growing.

2502
02:17:36,910 --> 02:17:39,100
If your wife wanted to go on
command should be talking about it.

2503
02:17:39,240 --> 02:17:42,100
Talking about nothing.
Yeah. Not here to talk.

2504
02:17:42,101 --> 02:17:45,010
That's why I'm here not to talk to you
before we go into the next dimension.

2505
02:17:45,070 --> 02:17:49,660
I have to know about the curtains. I
wanted to buy these characters. Yeah.

2506
02:17:49,690 --> 02:17:53,740
What does it somebody new lilypad a
float tank that hides in a day bed. Bam.

2507
02:17:54,400 --> 02:17:58,240
Somadi is the company that I bought my
first tank from. They make great stuff.

2508
02:17:58,300 --> 02:18:01,360
So that is a, it looks terrifying
though. What if someone's sitting on it,

2509
02:18:01,361 --> 02:18:04,900
you can't get out. Oh, that's true. Like,
Hey, really can you get off this thing?

2510
02:18:04,901 --> 02:18:06,640
I really want to get out of
here. I'm getting scared. Right.

2511
02:18:06,641 --> 02:18:09,430
If like a fat dude gets drunk
and falls asleep on the lid

2512
02:18:11,550 --> 02:18:12,620
and you ran out of,

2513
02:18:14,260 --> 02:18:18,190
you can't run in the air and there's
like a Arab bro so eventually you could

2514
02:18:18,220 --> 02:18:20,530
know nothing on the air and they
don't do this to me. It's actually,

2515
02:18:21,340 --> 02:18:24,970
there's actually a variable speed fan
and the one that I have that pumps in

2516
02:18:24,971 --> 02:18:29,220
oxygen. Okay. Clean, purified air.
So purifies the air and pumps it in.

2517
02:18:29,230 --> 02:18:30,610
It's not everyone's,
is that safe though?

2518
02:18:30,611 --> 02:18:33,790
If I go there and like it's like a
sealed system. That one right there,

2519
02:18:33,791 --> 02:18:37,960
the day bed one could be a real issue.
If you have said drunk fat guy, rich,

2520
02:18:37,961 --> 02:18:41,500
you have 37 minutes of air left.
Yeah, it's like an escape room.

2521
02:18:42,880 --> 02:18:45,880
That's another one that's coming to space
as the lights on it. What Jamie said,

2522
02:18:45,881 --> 02:18:48,250
this is what yours looks like, but
it has light. Well that's similar.

2523
02:18:48,570 --> 02:18:52,300
It looks like Sorta, sorta
not black. It's like whoa.

2524
02:18:52,420 --> 02:18:57,060
Mine is mine is the state of the art.
You have lights inside the earth? No,

2525
02:18:57,070 --> 02:19:01,630
there's no lights. Lights, Bro.
I know what I'm doing. I've been,

2526
02:19:01,660 --> 02:19:06,310
I had one of these in 2002 so I've
had one forever. I loved them.

2527
02:19:06,880 --> 02:19:07,960
We should all love them.
Yeah.

2528
02:19:07,970 --> 02:19:11,050
I think they're one of the best tools
ever for like thinking what else is a good

2529
02:19:11,051 --> 02:19:15,230
thing to marijuana? Yeah,
I heard you like marijuana.

2530
02:19:15,870 --> 02:19:19,370
I, you know what? I have interesting thing
for you. What are you going well things.

2531
02:19:19,720 --> 02:19:22,510
Um, so because I'm on a budget,
it looked my job and everything.

2532
02:19:22,720 --> 02:19:26,290
I stayed at a hostel because I'm
doing some broke people's shit. Right.

2533
02:19:27,380 --> 02:19:29,230
You're saying hostile? Probably not. No,

2534
02:19:29,240 --> 02:19:31,880
I've never stayed at a hostel in case
you don't know what a hospital is,

2535
02:19:31,881 --> 02:19:34,070
which everyone listening to
songs with a hostile is it's,

2536
02:19:34,071 --> 02:19:37,990
I shared a room with three other people
in the lung. That's right. Right.

2537
02:19:38,060 --> 02:19:41,270
So you know, Massachusetts
just said, hey listen,

2538
02:19:41,271 --> 02:19:43,160
you know we're going to allow marijuana,

2539
02:19:43,161 --> 02:19:45,020
but it's still kind of like a taboo thing.
Right.

2540
02:19:45,021 --> 02:19:49,400
They don't want it getting too widespread.
So when I came here to the hostile, uh,

2541
02:19:49,820 --> 02:19:54,140
I walked in and there's a giant bag of
marijuana on the table and I was like,

2542
02:19:54,141 --> 02:19:57,440
I'm sorry if someone's selling this.
Is this like, no, it's for you man.

2543
02:19:57,830 --> 02:20:00,320
Like we welcome our guests like this.
You could have as much as you want.

2544
02:20:00,350 --> 02:20:04,860
I'll say, where am I? Are you crazy?

2545
02:20:04,900 --> 02:20:08,420
It's crazy shit. Now he reels
smoke box the other day. Yeah.

2546
02:20:09,440 --> 02:20:13,430
I think I'm just starting to be non,
not high really from that,

2547
02:20:13,670 --> 02:20:17,120
from the other day. Is it out? I don't
know if he's released it yet. Anyway,

2548
02:20:17,210 --> 02:20:20,360
they gave me a bag of weed that every
time I open up the trunk of my Tusla,

2549
02:20:20,361 --> 02:20:22,940
it's like, whoa. So
what? So in over a skunk,

2550
02:20:23,000 --> 02:20:25,520
I'm not very familiar with
with smoking marijuana.

2551
02:20:25,521 --> 02:20:30,180
I think I've done it like once you worked
for the government, I don't know. Uh,

2552
02:20:30,210 --> 02:20:34,790
so I don't like once and it's like I try
to be cool like, yeah, you smoke, right?

2553
02:20:34,791 --> 02:20:39,050
I'm like, AH, yeah. Who Does
it right then? So I was told,

2554
02:20:39,070 --> 02:20:41,960
they offered me this big bag of
weed and I was like by should be,

2555
02:20:42,020 --> 02:20:45,110
because the thing is like if I try it
right, I want to be where I'm somewhere,

2556
02:20:45,380 --> 02:20:48,350
well, I mean say I'm going to
do crow. It's only marijuana.
It's not like, you know,

2557
02:20:48,351 --> 02:20:51,070
you don't want to freak out.
Right. That could happen and you,

2558
02:20:51,071 --> 02:20:53,120
you should only take a little,
I'll if you're gonna,

2559
02:20:53,270 --> 02:20:55,790
if you're gonna this is what you
do. You go like this, like this,

2560
02:20:55,791 --> 02:20:59,390
like it's a little, yeah,
just a touch. You know,

2561
02:21:00,170 --> 02:21:03,230
there's a smoke box. First of
all, be real. Smoked me in a coma.

2562
02:21:03,231 --> 02:21:06,290
I quit maybe five minutes into
the smoke box and I was like,

2563
02:21:06,291 --> 02:21:09,780
what in the fuck am I doing? We got high
before we got into the smoke box too,

2564
02:21:10,180 --> 02:21:14,750
that so many souls of stones. So smoke
box and ubiquity where you were in a car.

2565
02:21:14,751 --> 02:21:19,700
It was like a dedicated system. That's the
car. It's a an old Cadillac. Barbecued.

2566
02:21:19,730 --> 02:21:23,030
I am. I can't even keep my eyes open.
Wait, that's you? Yeah. I'm like,

2567
02:21:23,031 --> 02:21:25,730
I can't believe he's still smoke. Doesn't
even look like you. Exactly. I'm so high.

2568
02:21:25,731 --> 02:21:27,460
I'm in another dimension.
Holy Shit. Let's look.

2569
02:21:27,480 --> 02:21:30,410
Your frigging great
grandfather look good to me.

2570
02:21:31,890 --> 02:21:35,180
That's low lighting, but
the uh, that's crazy.

2571
02:21:35,240 --> 02:21:40,240
What be real does is he gets you in that
car and then everybody has a fat tube,

2572
02:21:41,000 --> 02:21:45,650
a big giant joint of the most
ridiculous weed on the planet earth.

2573
02:21:45,860 --> 02:21:48,200
There's none stronger, so why
not? So I don't understand.

2574
02:21:48,470 --> 02:21:51,200
What's the point of having a joint?
Just go in the car and get high that way,

2575
02:21:51,230 --> 02:21:54,020
but he's so hot. You can't
breathe. There's no air in there.

2576
02:21:54,080 --> 02:21:56,720
When I got out of there,
my inside of my mouth was cooked.

2577
02:21:56,990 --> 02:21:59,680
If he's never smoked weed, he doesn't
understand the hotbox constantly.

2578
02:21:59,950 --> 02:22:03,110
I don't understand. This is all new to
me. All that smoke you're breathing in,

2579
02:22:03,111 --> 02:22:04,670
right? So you're, you're smoking it,

2580
02:22:04,700 --> 02:22:07,400
so you're getting high from that and then
you breathe into other people smoked.

2581
02:22:07,400 --> 02:22:09,290
You get an extra hot. That's
what I'm saying. There's no air.

2582
02:22:09,291 --> 02:22:11,360
So why don't just go in there and
just be like, Hey, you know what?

2583
02:22:11,361 --> 02:22:13,530
I'm just gonna sit in here for five
minutes and get high. Then yeah,

2584
02:22:13,740 --> 02:22:17,110
you'd get high from that. I probably
wouldn't get really high from approach.

2585
02:22:17,330 --> 02:22:21,960
Your professional, he smoked
every day? No. Okay. Every
other day. No Sundays on now,

2586
02:22:22,100 --> 02:22:24,590
but I've been taking this stuff
every day. What is that? It's a DMT.

2587
02:22:24,650 --> 02:22:27,720
This is with THC.

2588
02:22:27,721 --> 02:22:31,320
It's 10 milligrams of THC
and 10 milligrams of CBD.

2589
02:22:31,350 --> 02:22:34,380
So it's not a lot of THC,
but it's enough.

2590
02:22:34,470 --> 02:22:36,540
So you just put those pills and
like your coffee or something?

2591
02:22:36,541 --> 02:22:38,640
I'll just swallow it.
It's like a little gel cap.

2592
02:22:39,000 --> 02:22:42,450
Well isn't that like not fun because it's
not, you're not smoking it. So I said,

2593
02:22:42,540 --> 02:22:46,620
oh like it's like a fish oil pill.
Exactly. But it's CBD oil with THC.

2594
02:22:46,621 --> 02:22:50,070
It's a hemp oil. So you just pop it
in and you're like, oh swallow it. No,

2595
02:22:50,071 --> 02:22:54,600
I take that back. I did have a
marijuana chocolate one. Was this? Yeah.

2596
02:22:54,601 --> 02:22:58,620
This was like, uh, last year. How'd it
go? Nothing. It was, it was like nothing.

2597
02:22:58,621 --> 02:22:59,790
I probably didn't take enough.
My friends,

2598
02:22:59,791 --> 02:23:03,270
like he didn't take it off so
I had it and then like an hour,

2599
02:23:03,270 --> 02:23:05,040
hour and hour later, this
is dumb. I just sat there,

2600
02:23:05,110 --> 02:23:07,680
I got a little high and I was just like,
Nah,

2601
02:23:07,681 --> 02:23:10,740
it wore off and went to sleep and it
was fine. I didn't take an off. Oh yeah,

2602
02:23:10,741 --> 02:23:13,500
you definitely didn't took it out.
Yeah, I was worried the other way. Yeah,

2603
02:23:13,501 --> 02:23:14,131
just way too much.

2604
02:23:14,131 --> 02:23:16,710
Like this is dumb and they have like
five more pieces of chalk. Exactly.

2605
02:23:16,711 --> 02:23:17,330
That's what people do.

2606
02:23:17,330 --> 02:23:20,040
The worst thing anybody could ever
say when they eat pot is, man,

2607
02:23:20,041 --> 02:23:22,900
I don't feel shit is dumb. And
then they take another one. Yeah.

2608
02:23:22,950 --> 02:23:25,830
And then it kicks in and then it gets
into your DNA and you're like, oh,

2609
02:23:26,750 --> 02:23:29,070
then your kids are high
and then you're on a ride.

2610
02:23:29,130 --> 02:23:31,980
You're on a ride for like
hours. Really? Oh my God.

2611
02:23:31,981 --> 02:23:36,981
I have a friend who ate too many edibles
and he was high for 27 or 28 hours.

2612
02:23:37,500 --> 02:23:41,610
Wow. A full day later, he was still high
and it took like four hours after that.

2613
02:23:41,670 --> 02:23:44,810
What is this guy's doing? The
leaf blower. What does that do?

2614
02:23:44,811 --> 02:23:49,530
And he's making a giant a hotbox
out of this. Oh, whoa. That's crazy.

2615
02:23:49,690 --> 02:23:53,520
What it gets and why you would want to
see some stoners like that girl right

2616
02:23:53,521 --> 02:23:56,960
there. They just get too high. Yeah,
like me. So it wasn't the hot hotbox

2617
02:23:58,460 --> 02:24:01,040
like what can you not do everything.
You can't do anything.

2618
02:24:02,430 --> 02:24:06,780
Is it like getting drunk? No,
no, no, no. You get paranoid.

2619
02:24:06,781 --> 02:24:09,520
You get freaked out and think about
people you fingered in high school. Oh,

2620
02:24:09,540 --> 02:24:11,940
you start,
he'll fucking,

2621
02:24:11,980 --> 02:24:14,910
you comb over everything
you've ever done ever.

2622
02:24:14,940 --> 02:24:17,760
That might be even remotely questionable.
So why would you want to get high then?

2623
02:24:17,970 --> 02:24:21,450
Well, I think there's a lot of, uh,
the, first of all, that's too high.

2624
02:24:21,930 --> 02:24:23,350
That's like paranoia.
Yeah.

2625
02:24:23,580 --> 02:24:28,190
But I think it gives you
like a self examination. Um,

2626
02:24:28,191 --> 02:24:30,450
that I think is probably critical
for people to just examine.

2627
02:24:30,451 --> 02:24:33,420
Like maybe you would be thinking
about your life puts you if you go on,

2628
02:24:33,530 --> 02:24:35,940
like if you got high and started thinking
about this job, you're quitting. Like,

2629
02:24:35,941 --> 02:24:39,480
why the fuck would I stay with this job?
Right. God, it could be here forever.

2630
02:24:39,630 --> 02:24:42,480
You can start getting paranoid and think
about what it's going to be like 60

2631
02:24:42,481 --> 02:24:45,000
years old.
I'm still here and I wish I took a chance,

2632
02:24:45,001 --> 02:24:47,200
but now it's too late
and I'm tired or better.

2633
02:24:47,200 --> 02:24:50,650
You have the energy to do it anymore. I
left and now I'm on skid row. Fuck yeah,

2634
02:24:51,090 --> 02:24:55,350
I do. I don't think like that. Yeah. So
you think you think very positively. Yeah.

2635
02:24:55,351 --> 02:25:00,000
I think, uh, if negative shit happens,
like you should be aware that it can,

2636
02:25:00,330 --> 02:25:03,820
but to dwell on it and I think
is not empowering at all. Right.

2637
02:25:03,930 --> 02:25:04,950
I think what's empowering,

2638
02:25:04,951 --> 02:25:09,951
it's like if you were a person who was
90 years old and you lived a boring ass,

2639
02:25:10,351 --> 02:25:14,970
stupid life, working in a shitty job, but
then someone gave you a chance and said,

2640
02:25:14,971 --> 02:25:16,980
rich,
how would you like to be?

2641
02:25:17,100 --> 02:25:22,100
You say 36 how would you like to be
36 again with vitality and youth and,

2642
02:25:23,800 --> 02:25:25,990
and ambition and you've
already got something going on.

2643
02:25:26,020 --> 02:25:30,130
You're got a youtube channel with like
450,000 subscribers. What would you think?

2644
02:25:30,490 --> 02:25:34,510
What would you be willing to do to try
again? Anything you did you say anything?

2645
02:25:34,590 --> 02:25:38,590
I want to, I want to be, I want to live
a fulfilled life. A life that I enjoy.

2646
02:25:38,620 --> 02:25:41,080
Well that's you right now.
So that's how I look at things.

2647
02:25:41,560 --> 02:25:44,050
I look at things like what would
I like to be if I, if I was,

2648
02:25:44,410 --> 02:25:49,410
if I was someone who was broken down
and beaten by life and exhausted and I

2649
02:25:49,991 --> 02:25:52,210
never took any chances,
right? What would I do now?

2650
02:25:53,200 --> 02:25:58,200
I would say if I could be that guy that
that is willing to just try to just take

2651
02:25:59,231 --> 02:26:02,980
risks. And, and carve a path for
yourself. I would want to be that guy.

2652
02:26:03,510 --> 02:26:05,290
I would want to live a
fulfilled life or your future.

2653
02:26:05,291 --> 02:26:07,690
So can anybody could do that,
man. Anybody could do that.

2654
02:26:07,691 --> 02:26:11,830
That's not cost prohibitive. It's
dangerous. There's risks, but,

2655
02:26:11,860 --> 02:26:15,340
but that's why it's good. Right? If
you knew you could, like if you put,

2656
02:26:15,341 --> 02:26:17,910
you ever play a video game and God
mode and just run around and shoot and

2657
02:26:17,911 --> 02:26:21,070
everything, you can't, you can't
die. It's boring. It's boring.

2658
02:26:21,220 --> 02:26:24,820
What's exciting is you could
die, right? Yeah, I is. It's
just like real life. Yeah.

2659
02:26:25,060 --> 02:26:26,290
It was exciting as risk.

2660
02:26:26,740 --> 02:26:31,160
You don't want to be that guy who's just
barely alive but alive. Right? Fuck that.

2661
02:26:31,161 --> 02:26:35,710
And by, because existing exists right
here live man. So we worked it out.

2662
02:26:35,740 --> 02:26:38,080
You're going to do standup, right?
I'm going to hand job already.

2663
02:26:38,081 --> 02:26:39,910
I want to go hang gliding.
All I want to do right now,

2664
02:26:39,911 --> 02:26:44,110
it's just smoke marijuana and then go
online is how one of the greatest Jujitsu

2665
02:26:44,111 --> 02:26:47,710
artists of all time hole's Gracie.
That's how he died. Really? Yeah.

2666
02:26:47,711 --> 02:26:50,640
Man was one of the greatest of all time.
But I'm not, I've lifted anymore. Joe,

2667
02:26:50,660 --> 02:26:55,360
you told me about this uplifting
thing die. What the Hell is going on?

2668
02:26:55,361 --> 02:26:58,570
What is going on? School reward. If
you land, oh great. You're still alive.

2669
02:26:58,840 --> 02:27:01,810
There's no reward. Well, you
got to almost die flying around,

2670
02:27:02,080 --> 02:27:06,700
but now I'm confused. Slammed
into a cliff, bro, but waive it.

2671
02:27:06,701 --> 02:27:08,750
But you just said that it's this thing,
exciting thing.

2672
02:27:09,490 --> 02:27:12,550
You could almost die if you quit your job,
right?

2673
02:27:12,551 --> 02:27:16,310
And then you take a path that you
may or may not succeed on, right?

2674
02:27:16,330 --> 02:27:20,410
You do succeed. You're going
to feel invigorated. You
took a chance and you want,

2675
02:27:20,610 --> 02:27:24,670
you got here. It's like the adrenaline
rush in a way. Oh No. What happened? Oh,

2676
02:27:24,671 --> 02:27:27,590
she's just a mishap. Oh No. Okay.

2677
02:27:27,610 --> 02:27:31,000
Just watch for a second and see what
you think is wrong here in the first 10

2678
02:27:31,001 --> 02:27:34,180
seconds. Okay? I can't believe I can't
show this to everybody on the line.

2679
02:27:34,180 --> 02:27:37,930
People know what's up. Oh my God,
he's not attached. I, I'll just wait.

2680
02:27:37,970 --> 02:27:42,760
Who was in charge here? The guy in the
blue. He's the, he's the leader guy.

2681
02:27:42,850 --> 02:27:46,270
Oh, and good luck here. Oh crap.

2682
02:27:46,870 --> 02:27:51,410
They're flying and he is holding on
tight by her. Nana are very high. Ah,

2683
02:27:51,670 --> 02:27:55,660
and they're going higher. Just
to be clear, this is a very,

2684
02:27:55,900 --> 02:28:00,520
this last four minutes. This is like this
last four minutes. Yeah. First of all,

2685
02:28:00,521 --> 02:28:01,354
turn around.

2686
02:28:02,280 --> 02:28:07,280
Do you have any idea how hard it is
to hold on to foot to four minutes?

2687
02:28:07,690 --> 02:28:12,400
Even two minutes is hard. How did this
guy do this? How did he manage to hang on,

2688
02:28:12,460 --> 02:28:17,280
look, I don't know. Like the, the person
in blue he's holding on. Oh my God.

2689
02:28:17,281 --> 02:28:20,260
No one hand do.
I went to a pull up and I say this,

2690
02:28:20,261 --> 02:28:23,000
the house I do a pull up and
get my arm might not be able to,

2691
02:28:23,001 --> 02:28:26,180
the drag of the win.
How does he hang on?

2692
02:28:27,860 --> 02:28:30,290
Oh my God. I get down to
the bottom. It is amazing.

2693
02:28:30,291 --> 02:28:34,640
His grip strength is incredible.
His forearms must be huge.
His, his grip strength.

2694
02:28:34,641 --> 02:28:36,680
Incredible.
Because what a chicken.

2695
02:28:36,681 --> 02:28:39,140
He couldn't wait till they got to the
actual ground running. You just couldn't.

2696
02:28:39,320 --> 02:28:41,940
I'm just kidding. Well, I don't even
think the guy even really demanded.

2697
02:28:41,990 --> 02:28:46,070
This is a very high definition. Video
was taken off a lot. What's Gopro? Gopro.

2698
02:28:46,610 --> 02:28:50,790
Wow. Proper way to land
Dick First. Fuck that.

2699
02:28:50,791 --> 02:28:54,250
What did you hit a rock with the locks.
Ramsey. Okay. What do I owe back?

2700
02:28:55,200 --> 02:28:57,560
Rest upon impact.
My right wrist,

2701
02:28:57,561 --> 02:29:01,010
she suffered a fragmented distal radius
fracture, which required surgery.

2702
02:29:01,040 --> 02:29:04,280
Damn son. He got luck. But that's
the thing. So like he took a risk,

2703
02:29:04,281 --> 02:29:07,760
but like there's a reward. The words like
that adrenaline rush, that's an asshole.

2704
02:29:08,060 --> 02:29:12,020
Go hand gliding and stuff. I hate hang
gliding. Parasailing. They'll watersports.

2705
02:29:12,350 --> 02:29:14,420
Yeah, you get a little bit of
an adrenaline rush, you know,

2706
02:29:14,900 --> 02:29:18,860
if you want to live for that little drug,
that little adrenaline drug. Go ahead.

2707
02:29:19,010 --> 02:29:20,690
What if you went hunting right?

2708
02:29:22,260 --> 02:29:26,780
Also also towards bicep
tendon from holding on as long
as he did. Wow. Live Damn.

2709
02:29:27,150 --> 02:29:31,610
Damn. Stay alive. Yeah.
Based shopping tomorrow. Wow.

2710
02:29:31,930 --> 02:29:36,430
Jeez. Um, so what if you
went hunting right? And you
didn't kill anything? It was,

2711
02:29:36,431 --> 02:29:39,120
it still fun happens all the
time. Yeah, sure. So it's the,

2712
02:29:39,400 --> 02:29:42,350
it's the thought that you might catch
something. Well, it's not even that.

2713
02:29:42,380 --> 02:29:45,870
You don't say catch. No, you guys kill
something. Destroy something. Oh No.

2714
02:29:47,060 --> 02:29:51,230
Running water down. They called
harvest harvesting, harvesting and out.

2715
02:29:51,290 --> 02:29:55,360
They actually do, I'm to throw, it's
not a pumpkin to fucking deer, Phil.

2716
02:29:56,340 --> 02:29:58,940
Yeah. I mean it's difficult
to do, but if you do,

2717
02:29:58,970 --> 02:30:01,250
that's one of the reasons
why when you do do it,

2718
02:30:01,251 --> 02:30:03,530
it feels like you accomplished
something. Right? Yeah.

2719
02:30:03,590 --> 02:30:05,210
So that's the positive aspect of it.

2720
02:30:05,211 --> 02:30:08,660
The positive aspect of it is that there's
a reward. If you could pull it off,

2721
02:30:09,230 --> 02:30:12,690
not just that you like, like I don't want
to go running with the bulls. I lived,

2722
02:30:13,080 --> 02:30:15,900
I lived awesome. Yeah, I guess that's
a good point to think about it. Well,

2723
02:30:15,930 --> 02:30:19,370
or have the coasters. I love roller
coasters, but I have kids. Okay.

2724
02:30:19,430 --> 02:30:21,290
I like roller coasters for my kids.
It was just for me.

2725
02:30:21,320 --> 02:30:25,710
I wouldn't go to the fucking Disneyland.
But you liked them because of your kids.

2726
02:30:25,930 --> 02:30:27,770
So I guess what I love it
is why people like that.

2727
02:30:27,771 --> 02:30:29,210
They like roller coast
gets an adrenaline rush.

2728
02:30:30,010 --> 02:30:31,680
It gives a little adrenaline rush.
Yeah.

2729
02:30:31,760 --> 02:30:35,360
I feel uncomfortable because I feel like
if I died this would be so stupid that

2730
02:30:35,361 --> 02:30:37,010
I didn't need to do this right.

2731
02:30:37,130 --> 02:30:40,400
But I did this for a cheap thrill and
it broke and I went flying off into the

2732
02:30:40,410 --> 02:30:42,230
fucking attic point. Good point. Yeah.

2733
02:30:42,610 --> 02:30:47,610
You know she coulda like those weird
carnivals that like pull up townie hokey

2734
02:30:48,650 --> 02:30:52,300
looking ones that you pull up in like
six trucks and it like unfolds as like,

2735
02:30:52,320 --> 02:30:56,420
like a checkers board dues one on it
came to my neighborhood and they had this

2736
02:30:56,421 --> 02:31:00,490
fucking thing where you spin around
really fast to the wall for a pop up.

2737
02:31:00,530 --> 02:31:03,230
I took pictures of the way it was set up.
I think it's on Instagram.

2738
02:31:03,470 --> 02:31:06,920
You probably won't be able to find it.
I took pictures. This is like years ago.

2739
02:31:07,250 --> 02:31:11,030
The way this thing was like on like
five or six different, two by fours.

2740
02:31:11,360 --> 02:31:12,670
It was like on blocks.

2741
02:31:13,270 --> 02:31:17,840
So Becky and people were
climbing in there. Oh boy. Gosh.

2742
02:31:17,890 --> 02:31:22,410
Affect your chances of dying
at those things. I like, whoa.

2743
02:31:23,060 --> 02:31:26,380
How did you find that so quickly? How
did you find that? I'm a Google master.

2744
02:31:26,810 --> 02:31:30,560
Damn good. You're a Google
master, but look at that
thing. Look how stupid that is.

2745
02:31:30,561 --> 02:31:34,530
So you can see the stacks of wood. That
is so good home. Hokey as hell, man.

2746
02:31:35,400 --> 02:31:38,220
They had to do that to balance it out
because they put that fucking thing on a

2747
02:31:38,221 --> 02:31:42,720
hill. What? So what? What
were you doing there? What's
your case? We're on that. No,

2748
02:31:42,721 --> 02:31:45,600
I didn't let them go for a shame. I didn't
let them get on that thing. But they,

2749
02:31:45,640 --> 02:31:47,230
you know,
you squirt the fucking gun,

2750
02:31:47,260 --> 02:31:51,040
the toll clown face and the balloon
pops and you went on stupid per what?

2751
02:31:51,041 --> 02:31:53,260
What would you nail at at
one of those carnivals? Well,

2752
02:31:53,261 --> 02:31:56,110
what do you like kill every not good
at anything. None of those things.

2753
02:31:56,840 --> 02:31:59,460
It's at the be against you, which sucks.
So I want to bring it back to aliens.

2754
02:31:59,520 --> 02:32:02,700
Yeah, yeah. God. Yeah. Three o'clock
please. Please, please. Yeah.

2755
02:32:02,880 --> 02:32:07,020
We've been doing this for three hours.
Are you shitting me for real? Damn.

2756
02:32:07,080 --> 02:32:11,200
All right. If the aliens came
to you and said, rich, yeah,

2757
02:32:11,280 --> 02:32:13,680
we're going to give you this
technology going to be yes,

2758
02:32:13,690 --> 02:32:17,910
but you can't tell anyone else.
Would you be willing to what technology?

2759
02:32:18,620 --> 02:32:22,550
What if the government brings you to
area 51 like Bob Lasar and they bring it

2760
02:32:22,551 --> 02:32:25,470
down into the base and they show
you an alien spacecraft and they go,

2761
02:32:25,500 --> 02:32:27,360
well we're going to let you examine this.

2762
02:32:27,361 --> 02:32:30,480
We know that you love to tinker and
back engineer things but you can't tell

2763
02:32:30,481 --> 02:32:32,070
anybody or are you in,
I'll do it in a heartbeat.

2764
02:32:32,340 --> 02:32:33,920
Why the hell not because you have a,

2765
02:32:34,110 --> 02:32:37,950
you owe us the rest of the human race
like these fucking assholes and the

2766
02:32:37,951 --> 02:32:40,560
government, they're going to
keep you telling us the truth.

2767
02:32:40,950 --> 02:32:43,770
Don't you think it would affect the
whole world if we knew now honestly,

2768
02:32:43,771 --> 02:32:46,530
I probably tell you on anyways cause the
fact that they called the Tesla guy to

2769
02:32:46,531 --> 02:32:48,360
go down there,
of course you're going to rat them out.

2770
02:32:48,450 --> 02:32:50,520
Well that's who I would call
if I was the government.

2771
02:32:50,521 --> 02:32:54,390
I wouldn't call some respectable scientist
from Stanford calls cause that guy,

2772
02:32:55,190 --> 02:32:58,230
I would call some dude who would
be like easily discredited.

2773
02:32:58,231 --> 02:33:01,140
So the guy who may be like,
maybe, you know, it was a little,

2774
02:33:01,141 --> 02:33:06,141
a little fudgy with this science reports
suspicious that'd be plagiarize a

2775
02:33:06,481 --> 02:33:08,820
little bit in college, but he
knows his shit. That's me. Yeah.

2776
02:33:11,770 --> 02:33:14,520
No, I would go with some guy who's, um,

2777
02:33:14,660 --> 02:33:18,960
was that autodidactic is that the
word someone learns themselves?

2778
02:33:19,650 --> 02:33:23,190
Is that what the word is? There's
a lot. Right, so the word,

2779
02:33:23,380 --> 02:33:26,250
there's a lot of geniuses out there.
We just don't have the credentials.

2780
02:33:26,310 --> 02:33:31,080
Very smart people and just auto didact.
Yeah. Yeah. Take that guy, take that guy.

2781
02:33:31,120 --> 02:33:34,710
Would you do that? No, I'd tell everybody.
Why a hundred percent why would you,

2782
02:33:34,711 --> 02:33:37,410
why do you, oh, wouldn't trust those
assholes. You don't owe anyone anything.

2783
02:33:37,440 --> 02:33:40,170
Cause I would, I would want everyone to
know what, what are they gonna do with it?

2784
02:33:40,220 --> 02:33:43,590
There's going to speak out. We'll
live with myself. Really? 100% yeah.

2785
02:33:43,591 --> 02:33:45,750
If the government wants to tell me some
secrets, let me tell you something.

2786
02:33:45,840 --> 02:33:49,980
I'll tell everybody. Yeah. Would you say
that first? I would definitely tell them.

2787
02:33:49,981 --> 02:33:53,580
I'm telling everybody is they
don't show it to me. Really? Yeah.

2788
02:33:53,581 --> 02:33:54,600
I would say don't show it to me,

2789
02:33:54,601 --> 02:33:58,640
but that's not progressing the human
race forward because, because all of us,

2790
02:33:58,700 --> 02:34:00,510
the goal is for you to see
it and confirm it. Right.

2791
02:34:00,690 --> 02:34:03,390
You want to see a confirm and tell
everyone you're just waiting to say,

2792
02:34:04,200 --> 02:34:07,660
I don't want to die and I don't want him
to kill me. So I would say, listen, you,

2793
02:34:07,780 --> 02:34:12,420
you show me. Show me. Maybe people have
done already and we don't know damn steep.

2794
02:34:12,510 --> 02:34:14,580
Maybe, Bro. Yeah, look into it.

2795
02:34:18,180 --> 02:34:23,000
I don't know. I was, it would be a
thing where I would, in all honesty,

2796
02:34:23,001 --> 02:34:25,960
it depends on what stage in my life.
If I was 30 years old and they said,

2797
02:34:25,990 --> 02:34:28,600
I'm going to show you this, but you
can't show anybody, are you willing?

2798
02:34:28,630 --> 02:34:32,230
I'd be like, yeah, sure, show
me. But at 50 I'd be like,

2799
02:34:33,450 --> 02:34:37,960
no, no. I'm not making any deals.
I don't want to make a deal.

2800
02:34:37,990 --> 02:34:40,930
Or you tell me that I can't tell
anybody about something. I mean,

2801
02:34:40,931 --> 02:34:43,240
it's one thing if it's a business
thing, like, hey, we're going to,

2802
02:34:43,330 --> 02:34:45,880
Apple's going to show you the new
iPhone. Don't tell anybody. Oh for sure.

2803
02:34:45,881 --> 02:34:48,390
I won't tell anybody. Right,
fine. But this is something,

2804
02:34:48,400 --> 02:34:50,540
what would affect the human race?
How would Ald,

2805
02:34:50,650 --> 02:34:53,110
how would the confirmation of aliens,
the fact that human race,

2806
02:34:53,140 --> 02:34:56,530
you think there are aliens
now what we're going to do,

2807
02:34:56,620 --> 02:35:01,620
realistically you would have to have
confirmation that was undeniable and your

2808
02:35:02,441 --> 02:35:05,280
own eye witness that's not good enough.
Just think you're crazy.

2809
02:35:05,290 --> 02:35:06,123
They'll shoot you anyways.

2810
02:35:06,580 --> 02:35:09,610
They'll just think you're a
fool and they'll just make
you look like a dunce and

2811
02:35:09,611 --> 02:35:13,690
no, it would actually probably help their
cause because no one would ever believe

2812
02:35:13,691 --> 02:35:17,290
you and no one would take
alien seriously after that,

2813
02:35:17,291 --> 02:35:21,580
which is one of the arguments for like
what they actually did with project blue

2814
02:35:21,581 --> 02:35:21,881
book.

2815
02:35:21,881 --> 02:35:26,881
Like there was a guy in Phillip Corso
and Jay Allen Hynek was the guy who was

2816
02:35:27,551 --> 02:35:29,060
running project blue book.

2817
02:35:29,061 --> 02:35:32,050
And one of the things that they famously
said after it was over that they were,

2818
02:35:32,320 --> 02:35:36,700
they would just try to debunk things and
make these things look foolish. Yeah.

2819
02:35:36,970 --> 02:35:39,910
And then anything they found that they
couldn't explain, they just tucked away.

2820
02:35:40,480 --> 02:35:43,020
But the things that they could
explain, even if the, the,

2821
02:35:43,021 --> 02:35:45,550
the explanation didn't jive.

2822
02:35:45,620 --> 02:35:49,570
It came up with an explanation just to
make people realize that aliens were

2823
02:35:49,571 --> 02:35:54,460
bullshit. Right. But he, through the
course of project blue book studying now,

2824
02:35:54,490 --> 02:35:57,460
now you have to ask your question.
This question through the end of it,

2825
02:35:57,461 --> 02:36:01,660
he decided that aliens were real and that
we had been contacted. Yeah. However,

2826
02:36:02,140 --> 02:36:07,140
you always have to question
whether someone is doing
that because this is a new

2827
02:36:07,931 --> 02:36:12,190
avenue for them to make money.
Is this a new stream of revenue?

2828
02:36:12,280 --> 02:36:15,250
I'm going to do the lecture circuit.
I'm going to write books. I mean,

2829
02:36:15,251 --> 02:36:18,160
if you're a guy where for project blue
book and then they shut project blue book

2830
02:36:18,161 --> 02:36:20,560
down, you don't have any more money.
Yeah. You're broken and you decide, well,

2831
02:36:20,561 --> 02:36:22,930
I don't want to work for the government
anymore. You know what I want to do?

2832
02:36:22,931 --> 02:36:26,250
I'm going to write stories
about UFO startup podcasts.
Lock these assholes, right.

2833
02:36:26,500 --> 02:36:29,980
I mean, Jay Allen Hynek died a
long time ago, I believe. Right?

2834
02:36:31,540 --> 02:36:35,170
Well, Google Jay Allen Hynek
Project Blue Book Ufo All.

2835
02:36:35,380 --> 02:36:40,380
I'm pretty sure there's interviews where
after he said he is sure after all of

2836
02:36:41,531 --> 02:36:46,270
his time studying that there is
and has been some contact with

2837
02:36:46,280 --> 02:36:51,220
extraterrestrials. What do
you think? I don't, I don't
know. See me, me personally,

2838
02:36:51,221 --> 02:36:56,030
I have zero experience. Right, right.
Well, so someone might, what do you got?

2839
02:36:56,050 --> 02:36:58,390
What are you laughing at? Oh Man,
I don't want to talk about it yet.

2840
02:36:58,660 --> 02:37:01,240
You don't want to talk about
and talk about it yet. Stuff
I've been looking into.

2841
02:37:01,330 --> 02:37:03,220
Go ahead about this topic
that this guy worked at,

2842
02:37:03,221 --> 02:37:06,940
that company I've been told and
told you about in Columbus, Ohio.

2843
02:37:07,150 --> 02:37:10,660
He also was a teacher of physics
and astronomy at Ohio state in 1936.

2844
02:37:11,210 --> 02:37:13,010
That's what you think.
There's some real shit going down.

2845
02:37:13,330 --> 02:37:16,400
Maybe you think some real shit's going
down. I don't know about all the alien

2846
02:37:16,400 --> 02:37:20,540
technologies or uh, actually like what
do I beings or aliens or something.

2847
02:37:21,410 --> 02:37:24,890
There's something going on and it has
to do with that company and it has to do

2848
02:37:24,891 --> 02:37:27,080
with everything you're talking
about and project blue book.

2849
02:37:27,140 --> 02:37:29,630
I don't know what it is.
That's very fake. I know

2850
02:37:31,220 --> 02:37:33,770
something's going on guys. I
can't cause it's it, to me,

2851
02:37:33,771 --> 02:37:36,380
it doesn't seem fair to just
go with the big conspiracy,

2852
02:37:36,381 --> 02:37:38,840
but there are facts that
you can look up and find.

2853
02:37:38,841 --> 02:37:41,450
So once you get to the
bottom of your investigation,

2854
02:37:41,451 --> 02:37:42,550
you will have a report for it.

2855
02:37:44,340 --> 02:37:46,700
I'm not ready to cut the sounds
a little too crazy right now.

2856
02:37:46,701 --> 02:37:48,770
I want to leave some of the
craziest stuff out. Yeah.

2857
02:37:48,800 --> 02:37:53,800
It's one of those subjects that inherently
starts looking crazy until alien show

2858
02:37:53,811 --> 02:37:56,710
up. Right there was like that.
What was that movie? What was the,

2859
02:37:56,870 --> 02:38:01,460
the recent movie with the, the, the
way they spoke in like smoke. Oh.

2860
02:38:01,660 --> 02:38:04,970
Oh God. Um, was that big rival or rival?

2861
02:38:05,540 --> 02:38:07,100
If something like that shows up,

2862
02:38:08,060 --> 02:38:11,900
then all of a sudden our
perceptions completely changed.
Like, oh wait, undeniable.

2863
02:38:11,930 --> 02:38:16,930
If there's like some giant Los Angeles
size Yang floating over the continental

2864
02:38:17,001 --> 02:38:20,750
us, yeah. We'd be like, okay, all right.
So that's the thing. So why would you,

2865
02:38:20,990 --> 02:38:24,290
so if we, let's just say
we had a microscope, right?
Periscope, whatever the,

2866
02:38:24,330 --> 02:38:26,830
whatever you call it, to look in the
space. Really Fullscope telescope,

2867
02:38:27,020 --> 02:38:31,610
terra scope. If I wasn't a submarine, so,

2868
02:38:32,330 --> 02:38:37,010
and we see an e an alien, you know,
colony. Yeah. I'm like, Mars. What?

2869
02:38:37,011 --> 02:38:40,160
What would we do? We'd study it.
Yeah. We tried to communicate with it,

2870
02:38:40,370 --> 02:38:43,070
but would that be a good move? Like what
if they came over to us and they'll go,

2871
02:38:43,100 --> 02:38:47,350
oh, look at these fucking dumb champs. Do
you think these, do they, you think the,

2872
02:38:47,360 --> 02:38:51,170
any foreign or alien species?
We think we're idiots.

2873
02:38:51,540 --> 02:38:53,760
100% of really think we're idiots.
Okay.

2874
02:38:53,900 --> 02:38:56,630
If they're advanced to the point where
they've gotten control over their

2875
02:38:56,631 --> 02:38:58,310
emotions and anger, right? I mean,

2876
02:38:58,311 --> 02:39:02,180
just think about how much tribal
warfare goes on still in America, uh,

2877
02:39:02,240 --> 02:39:06,890
in the world. You know, how much,
how much warfare is taking place,

2878
02:39:06,891 --> 02:39:09,740
how many people are dying,
how many innocent people
are dying? It would, drones,

2879
02:39:09,741 --> 02:39:10,410
all that kind of stuff.

2880
02:39:10,410 --> 02:39:13,220
Then they'd be aware of all that
they'd be aware of are polluting of the

2881
02:39:13,221 --> 02:39:17,150
environment they'd be aware of,
are depleting the ocean of it's fish.

2882
02:39:17,220 --> 02:39:20,370
It's just pulling and giant nets filled.
We clean him.

2883
02:39:20,420 --> 02:39:22,280
What the fuck are you people doing?

2884
02:39:22,430 --> 02:39:24,920
They'd be looking at coal plants
and the president of United States,

2885
02:39:24,921 --> 02:39:28,730
the greatest super power the world's ever
known, saying things like clean coal,

2886
02:39:29,090 --> 02:39:32,000
clean coal. What do you so,
so what do you think? Okay,

2887
02:39:32,001 --> 02:39:33,290
so someone comes to visit us,
right?

2888
02:39:33,320 --> 02:39:36,290
What's the dumbest thing that they're
going to notice? The first you can say,

2889
02:39:36,291 --> 02:39:37,830
Oh wow,
this is the dumbest thing I've ever say.

2890
02:39:37,831 --> 02:39:42,140
What's the number one thing you visit
our planet? The number one dumbest thing.

2891
02:39:42,141 --> 02:39:44,200
They're going to see
him to light pollutions.

2892
02:39:44,210 --> 02:39:48,080
The number one dumbest like you are years
are shitting in the environment that

2893
02:39:48,081 --> 02:39:52,400
you need to sustain. You all right?
You're, you're, and you're doing this in,

2894
02:39:52,490 --> 02:39:56,300
it's not like you don't have the resources
to fix that infinite money. Yeah,

2895
02:39:56,301 --> 02:39:58,250
and we have incredible amounts of money,

2896
02:39:58,251 --> 02:40:00,560
but yet the money's
not going towards that.

2897
02:40:00,920 --> 02:40:05,920
Massive resources should be going to
removing carbon from the atmosphere.

2898
02:40:05,991 --> 02:40:08,650
Removing particulates from the atmosphere.
Yeah,

2899
02:40:08,660 --> 02:40:12,680
like brake dust and all the shit that's
in these cities and these cars are

2900
02:40:12,681 --> 02:40:15,960
constantly on their brakes. That dusty,
you have to clean off your wheels.

2901
02:40:16,050 --> 02:40:19,680
That shit's everywhere to new lungs.
Maybe it's fucking everywhere. Yeah.

2902
02:40:19,780 --> 02:40:22,170
It takes years off people's lives.
It absolutely does.

2903
02:40:22,440 --> 02:40:25,500
They would look at all that. They would
go, go, why aren't they looking at that?

2904
02:40:25,530 --> 02:40:26,370
Like why aren't they,

2905
02:40:26,460 --> 02:40:30,760
why don't they have some sort of system
in place to mitigate all the problems

2906
02:40:30,761 --> 02:40:33,030
that have created in terms
of like, oh, I'll mean,

2907
02:40:33,090 --> 02:40:37,080
oh they got rid of plastic straws.
Keep, keep the caps though.

2908
02:40:37,081 --> 02:40:41,070
Keep the bottles are fine.
Keep the tabs that you pull off of things.

2909
02:40:41,071 --> 02:40:43,980
Keep plastic wrap.
Everything's plastic.

2910
02:40:43,981 --> 02:40:47,250
They think of those new disintegrating
straws by the way. Ridiculous. It's like,

2911
02:40:47,790 --> 02:40:50,400
I want to keep around what a
stainless steel we'll should,

2912
02:40:50,401 --> 02:40:52,380
but you have to clean it though.
That same thing.

2913
02:40:52,470 --> 02:40:54,530
You can halt stab somebody
if somebody attacks you.

2914
02:40:54,531 --> 02:40:57,030
If you get one with sharp pointy end,
oh I'm sorry.

2915
02:40:57,060 --> 02:41:00,900
Did I status for punch a hole through them
like that walking dead. Crossbow Bolt.

2916
02:41:01,350 --> 02:41:05,880
Yeah. Yeah. I think, um, that's
the big one that we would,

2917
02:41:06,030 --> 02:41:08,340
that they would get. They would
go, wow, these people are crazy.

2918
02:41:08,490 --> 02:41:10,470
The other thing they would say
is the nuclear power thing.

2919
02:41:10,471 --> 02:41:13,620
Like when you find out things like the
Fukushima plant, they didn't have, uh,

2920
02:41:14,070 --> 02:41:16,920
any sort of backup plan to
shut the hell up, shut it down.

2921
02:41:17,430 --> 02:41:20,660
Like you don't know what happens if your
generator goes out. Oh, well we're fuck,

2922
02:41:20,661 --> 02:41:24,350
well now it's just being
really clear. Meltdown and
everything dies forever. Yeah.

2923
02:41:24,690 --> 02:41:27,210
Yeah. They didn't plan on that
like that. The fact that we,

2924
02:41:27,300 --> 02:41:30,840
they built these plants and they
have no idea how to shut them off.

2925
02:41:30,841 --> 02:41:32,050
Like that's crazy.
Yeah.

2926
02:41:32,190 --> 02:41:34,110
The aliens are probably like these
people out of their fucking mind.

2927
02:41:34,111 --> 02:41:36,510
They're smart enough to figure
out how to harness nuclear power,

2928
02:41:36,690 --> 02:41:41,690
but what they use it for is to generate
steam constant and it has to stay on

2929
02:41:41,971 --> 02:41:43,700
forever.
That's why they put them near the ocean.

2930
02:41:43,701 --> 02:41:46,290
It's like these cats are assholes.
Give me sense. Yeah. Now.

2931
02:41:47,040 --> 02:41:48,990
The other thing too is that how would you,

2932
02:41:49,140 --> 02:41:52,740
let's just say things are going to
shit really quickly, right? Right.

2933
02:41:52,770 --> 02:41:55,490
There's a nuclear power plant that's going
to blow up any second. Now the second,

2934
02:41:56,040 --> 02:42:00,900
how would you, are you like a, I know
you're an outdoorsy guy, you hunt,

2935
02:42:00,980 --> 02:42:03,690
you kill harvest as they say.
Sorry.

2936
02:42:04,170 --> 02:42:07,830
How long do you think you could survive
if things went to shit really quickly?

2937
02:42:07,890 --> 02:42:11,280
If you have to survive, you have
all the money you want, right?

2938
02:42:11,700 --> 02:42:14,580
But like how long do you think you
could survive in the wilderness?

2939
02:42:14,760 --> 02:42:18,270
It would be very hard. It's
not easy. And not only that,

2940
02:42:18,300 --> 02:42:19,410
you got to get through the winter,

2941
02:42:19,440 --> 02:42:21,820
so you're going to have to build some
sort of a shelter. But he goes, no,

2942
02:42:21,830 --> 02:42:25,410
it's amazing with fire. There's no
winter here that was there. I mean, um,

2943
02:42:25,411 --> 02:42:28,500
what's it called? [inaudible]
gets here in la, but in big bear,

2944
02:42:28,590 --> 02:42:30,420
which was only a couple of
hours north of here. Yeah.

2945
02:42:30,510 --> 02:42:33,330
I mean there's plenty of places where
you could drive and a couple of hours you

2946
02:42:33,331 --> 02:42:35,940
could go to big bear and then
you can go down to the beach.

2947
02:42:35,941 --> 02:42:37,320
You could experience the desert,

2948
02:42:37,590 --> 02:42:39,240
you could experience a
lot of different climates.

2949
02:42:39,450 --> 02:42:42,720
It would really depend upon where you
were stuck and what what you would eat.

2950
02:42:43,440 --> 02:42:45,420
So the thing is if you want
to stay in the La area,

2951
02:42:45,421 --> 02:42:47,940
you're dead because you're not
going to be able to eat shit.

2952
02:42:48,030 --> 02:42:50,310
There's nothing here. Would you stay
in your head? What would you migrate?

2953
02:42:50,311 --> 02:42:52,830
Give your kids and you gotta
get Outta here. So you'd leave,

2954
02:42:52,831 --> 02:42:56,850
you'd drive your Tesla. Which
carbon? No Way. What? No Way.

2955
02:42:56,880 --> 02:43:00,570
It was a big debate that I had in
the, in a crisis situation. Right.

2956
02:43:00,920 --> 02:43:03,330
Would you take the test though or
would you take, would you take,

2957
02:43:03,360 --> 02:43:06,810
I have a Toyota Land Cruiser
with a VA gallon gas tank.

2958
02:43:07,650 --> 02:43:11,540
I got a apocalypse immobile,
but so now I went through a big and I got,

2959
02:43:11,620 --> 02:43:14,620
I got shit on so much for this. I said
the same exact thing. It's like, listen,

2960
02:43:14,980 --> 02:43:16,540
in a Oh shit situation,

2961
02:43:16,870 --> 02:43:21,490
I would leave the tussle behind argued
with you about that. A lot of people,

2962
02:43:22,000 --> 02:43:24,670
I believe that behind,
I take my pickup truck like Tacoma,

2963
02:43:24,730 --> 02:43:26,000
that's how I deal with gas numbers.

2964
02:43:26,050 --> 02:43:30,180
500% in an emergency crisis situation.
Uh,

2965
02:43:30,670 --> 02:43:33,340
you don't have access to get,
what if the gasoline didn't work?

2966
02:43:33,380 --> 02:43:35,590
You're go to the liquor store,
you fill it up with alcohol.

2967
02:43:35,890 --> 02:43:40,300
We'll run where we had the hurricane in
Florida now every was saying like you

2968
02:43:40,301 --> 02:43:43,930
have that the gas pumps wouldn't work
cause he electricity was shut off. Uh,

2969
02:43:44,260 --> 02:43:47,110
but the superchargers still work and
you could get to your destination still.

2970
02:43:47,111 --> 02:43:49,120
And like Tesla's use less energy.

2971
02:43:49,360 --> 02:43:51,970
It's like at the end of the day I
happened to pick up truck with like two

2972
02:43:51,971 --> 02:43:55,540
shotguns and like five things, a gasoline
and be fine. I don't understand that.

2973
02:43:55,800 --> 02:44:00,070
They also make tanks that you can put
in your gas tank, uh, in your, uh,

2974
02:44:00,160 --> 02:44:02,740
the bed of your truck. Right?
Like the survival tanks,

2975
02:44:02,750 --> 02:44:06,250
the drive as far as you want it 800
miles. Yeah. And they more and they've,

2976
02:44:06,360 --> 02:44:09,190
you drive thousands of miles.
There's a guy who actually,

2977
02:44:09,191 --> 02:44:11,250
there was a podcast that
I was listening to. Um,

2978
02:44:11,600 --> 02:44:16,600
this guy who is like an extreme prepper
and he actually made a trip with one

2979
02:44:19,150 --> 02:44:23,890
tank of gas from Arizona to Canada.
Damn. He drove all the way up to Canada,

2980
02:44:23,950 --> 02:44:28,950
all the way across with one tank of gas
because this massive tank in the back of

2981
02:44:29,171 --> 02:44:33,730
his pickup truck. Right. It feeds directly
into his primary gas tank. Yeah. Yeah.

2982
02:44:33,731 --> 02:44:37,510
And you can get these, they're like
these survival tanks and you know,

2983
02:44:37,511 --> 02:44:41,180
they'll host like hundreds of gallons
are also a target. I probably should,

2984
02:44:41,181 --> 02:44:43,810
I probably shoot it. That guy's
car. That's what I think to do that.

2985
02:44:43,811 --> 02:44:46,780
So I don't know. All of a
sudden you're lawless. Barbera.

2986
02:44:46,910 --> 02:44:50,290
I know the lights go on for five minutes.
Want to kill everyone starting fires.

2987
02:44:50,890 --> 02:44:55,060
Shooting cars. Yeah. So, so
then, all right, so you leave,
you take your family, right?

2988
02:44:55,450 --> 02:44:57,880
You have your kids. If your wife, where
are you going to go? You're hopping,

2989
02:44:57,881 --> 02:45:00,060
you're land cruiser. Where are you
going to go? You have a real penalty.

2990
02:45:00,150 --> 02:45:01,620
What are you going to bring you?
Well,

2991
02:45:01,650 --> 02:45:06,510
you would have to bring things to start
a fire and things to kill animals. Right.

2992
02:45:06,550 --> 02:45:10,780
Those are the things that it would be
very important. Oh, would bring guns.

2993
02:45:11,270 --> 02:45:14,650
I'd bring Bose.
I'd bring ammunition and arrows,

2994
02:45:14,980 --> 02:45:17,680
but I would realistically realize that,
first of all,

2995
02:45:17,681 --> 02:45:20,560
I'm not going to make more bullets and
I'm not going to make more arrows. Right.

2996
02:45:20,561 --> 02:45:24,310
Am I going to do, and how long am I going
to ask you to be marijuana? No. Okay. No,

2997
02:45:25,060 --> 02:45:27,100
no. I'll be just trying
to stay alive. Yeah,

2998
02:45:27,130 --> 02:45:29,890
but you'd also be trying to stay alive
for a long period of time. Right?

2999
02:45:29,891 --> 02:45:34,590
You might want to bring it needs the pain.
No, really? What? It's not going to that,

3000
02:45:35,020 --> 02:45:37,990
I mean, marijuana for pain relief.
I'm going against. It works. Yeah,

3001
02:45:38,040 --> 02:45:42,640
but that's not what I use a paint at
night of the impending doom here. Yeah.

3002
02:45:42,641 --> 02:45:47,220
You'd be freaking out even
more. I'm freaking out.
Plenty. Yeah. And maybe I just,

3003
02:45:47,500 --> 02:45:51,160
there's no, there's not room. I would
bring water, water purification tablets,

3004
02:45:51,280 --> 02:45:53,980
no food shelters and food
that would bring food.

3005
02:45:54,280 --> 02:45:59,280
I'd probably been food in the form
of a heavy duty bars like that take,

3006
02:45:59,621 --> 02:46:03,450
don't take up a lot of space,
but dense and nutrient rich like a,

3007
02:46:03,460 --> 02:46:05,500
there's those green belly bars and bars.
Yeah.

3008
02:46:05,501 --> 02:46:09,980
Something that has a lot of calories,
high calories in a small package. A small

3009
02:46:10,250 --> 02:46:14,200
size. All right, where are you heading?
Yeah, exactly. Yeah, go. He goes, yeah.

3010
02:46:14,210 --> 02:46:17,320
You got to go somewhere where there's
animals and even then you're not gonna

3011
02:46:17,340 --> 02:46:18,980
make it and your kids are
probably not gonna make it.

3012
02:46:19,210 --> 02:46:21,200
That's the real thing is it's true.

3013
02:46:22,010 --> 02:46:24,890
The idea that you're going to live off
of animals. This is in the Serengeti man.

3014
02:46:25,150 --> 02:46:29,720
There's not a lot of animals unless you're
somewhere where you can find a lot of

3015
02:46:29,721 --> 02:46:31,400
fucking animals like rabbits and shit,

3016
02:46:31,401 --> 02:46:34,250
and you got to keep them like you're
going to have to kill them every other day

3017
02:46:34,251 --> 02:46:36,590
because they're not going
to last with the heat.

3018
02:46:36,680 --> 02:46:40,580
And your kids aren't gonna eat a dead
rabbit for sure. Dead Rabbit. Yeah.

3019
02:46:40,600 --> 02:46:43,700
They'll eat a rabbit. Yeah. Mike, my
kids will eat pretty much anything.

3020
02:46:43,701 --> 02:46:47,360
You want to start a fire? Yes. Really?
Yeah, but it's not easy. No, it's not.

3021
02:46:47,810 --> 02:46:51,860
If you have a string and a bow and
two pieces of dried wood and you know

3022
02:46:51,861 --> 02:46:54,950
hardwood and a softer would, you
can do it. No, you can do it,

3023
02:46:55,280 --> 02:46:58,370
but it ain't easy like starting
a boat with one of those

3024
02:47:00,020 --> 02:47:04,250
two months. It takes a little
while, but it's not easy.

3025
02:47:04,251 --> 02:47:07,130
You're better off with the Flint.
If you have a Flint and a piece of metal,

3026
02:47:07,340 --> 02:47:08,690
you could start a fire pretty easy.

3027
02:47:09,080 --> 02:47:12,260
And also you want to bring with
you some Tinder. You want to, um,

3028
02:47:12,320 --> 02:47:14,750
if you have some dry Tinder,
she bring that with you too.

3029
02:47:15,030 --> 02:47:19,550
But you're in for a world of hate world
of Shit if you want to really survive.

3030
02:47:19,570 --> 02:47:22,330
Right. Those, whenever I
watched those survival shows,

3031
02:47:22,690 --> 02:47:25,270
which I love by the way, that they're
already into that shit, they're exciting,

3032
02:47:25,271 --> 02:47:27,920
right? Yeah. I'm in and that shit,
what did I do? But yeah, check.

3033
02:47:27,940 --> 02:47:31,390
It was just thinking of that. A youtube
kind of fed this to me the other day,

3034
02:47:31,660 --> 02:47:36,660
300 days die self documentary of him
spending 300 days on an island by himself.

3035
02:47:36,850 --> 02:47:39,730
She got dropped off with a satellite phone
cause he ends up getting hurt at some

3036
02:47:39,731 --> 02:47:43,720
point during it. He cut his
own hand off. I'm not sure.

3037
02:47:43,721 --> 02:47:46,480
I don't hear because there's lots of use.
You can look it up 200 days alone. He,

3038
02:47:46,510 --> 02:47:48,070
he does it at the very end of it.

3039
02:47:48,130 --> 02:47:51,340
His friend meets him and he shows him
what he's been doing for like the last two

3040
02:47:51,341 --> 02:47:56,320
weeks all alone. This is a volcano on this
island. He looked like he freaked out.

3041
02:47:56,321 --> 02:47:58,810
He's basically like castaway at the
end of this fucking document. Oh yeah.

3042
02:47:58,811 --> 02:47:59,890
I'm sure.
It's pretty cool.

3043
02:48:00,210 --> 02:48:03,930
That's a fucking hard thing to do
just for your mind and do that.

3044
02:48:03,960 --> 02:48:08,490
He's weaving together ropes and
shit. Yeah. Fuck you want an island?

3045
02:48:08,491 --> 02:48:11,550
How long you can last? I probably
last. I'd make it maybe 45 minutes.

3046
02:48:11,620 --> 02:48:15,750
It depends on if I knew that my family
was still alive. Yeah, I will make it.

3047
02:48:15,840 --> 02:48:16,950
Really? Yeah. I'll figure it out.

3048
02:48:17,020 --> 02:48:20,900
Did it make it a little pig? Oh my God.
For a little while I thought it was dead.

3049
02:48:20,901 --> 02:48:22,240
He's going to kill it. No, no, no, no.

3050
02:48:22,280 --> 02:48:25,680
He kept it as a pet and like it ended
up running away. How did he feed it?

3051
02:48:26,380 --> 02:48:29,090
He feeds it. He tells you, it shows
you what he does. It's pretty cool.

3052
02:48:29,091 --> 02:48:32,080
It's pretty wild pig.
Well it means that he's on

3053
02:48:32,200 --> 02:48:35,590
very uh,
animal rich environment.

3054
02:48:35,620 --> 02:48:37,330
If he's on an island with pigs.

3055
02:48:38,160 --> 02:48:41,910
I had a child get something so they
kill any pigs. I don't, I didn't,

3056
02:48:41,940 --> 02:48:44,920
I honestly didn't watch
another tire thing around it.

3057
02:48:45,480 --> 02:48:48,360
I didn't watch the whole thing cause
it's hour long. Pigs piss right.

3058
02:48:49,510 --> 02:48:51,920
It was just really cool. And you start
talking about that. I just saw it.

3059
02:48:53,340 --> 02:48:58,260
He brought his dog. He's lying.
That guy's in Topanga Canyon.

3060
02:49:01,520 --> 02:49:06,110
He's right behind Kanye. So I
was just how he caught fish. Oh,

3061
02:49:06,120 --> 02:49:07,980
he's got a fishing rod.
He is right here.

3062
02:49:07,980 --> 02:49:11,040
He got, he had some guys drop
him off and he just said,

3063
02:49:11,041 --> 02:49:15,750
don't come back for 300 days if you don't
charge the batteries for this footage.

3064
02:49:15,870 --> 02:49:20,190
You have a cell phone chargers that you
saddle satellite or use a solar power.

3065
02:49:20,550 --> 02:49:23,460
A lot of guys use those when really?
Yeah. My friend Adam Green tree,

3066
02:49:23,820 --> 02:49:27,930
he lives in Australia and every year he
comes to America and he's a bow hunter

3067
02:49:27,931 --> 02:49:32,931
and he'd do like a one month trek solo
in the mountains hunting for elk and he

3068
02:49:33,031 --> 02:49:34,560
uses these solar panels,

3069
02:49:34,561 --> 02:49:37,740
the lays out and they charged
battery packs and that's
what he charges his phone.

3070
02:49:37,920 --> 02:49:38,530
And so he,

3071
02:49:38,530 --> 02:49:43,020
he got very famous on Instagram for
documenting all this in his Instagram

3072
02:49:43,021 --> 02:49:43,854
stories.

3073
02:49:43,980 --> 02:49:47,910
Like he got an altercation with a grizzly
bear and he was documenting it like

3074
02:49:47,911 --> 02:49:50,470
you could see in the Instagram
story of the bear standing up. No,

3075
02:49:50,471 --> 02:49:53,690
she looking at him and, and coming towards
him and he's, he's got a pistol out.

3076
02:49:53,700 --> 02:49:57,990
It turned out the pistol was jammed
[inaudible] the beer then he didn't,

3077
02:49:58,050 --> 02:49:59,700
he didn't have to,
but he had it pointed at the,

3078
02:50:00,030 --> 02:50:02,800
he didn't even understand that the pistol,
like it wasn't his pistol. So yeah,

3079
02:50:03,060 --> 02:50:05,640
let him borrow it for
personal safety in the forest.

3080
02:50:05,940 --> 02:50:08,400
And the bullet was the
wrong size for the pistol.

3081
02:50:08,420 --> 02:50:11,760
It kind of blew up in his hand if you're
not careful. Yeah. Something, who knows?

3082
02:50:12,100 --> 02:50:16,800
Yeah. Not good, but he's fine now. He's
okay. He's okay. He's an Australian man.

3083
02:50:16,830 --> 02:50:19,600
They're a different breed of people. They
have some shit down there. Yeah, they're,

3084
02:50:19,970 --> 02:50:21,420
they're the children of criminals.

3085
02:50:23,220 --> 02:50:27,960
The British like British people who back
then when everybody was a criminal like

3086
02:50:27,990 --> 02:50:31,580
you guys are too crazy. Yeah. Get
the fuck off our continent. Exactly.

3087
02:50:32,270 --> 02:50:35,970
Australia put him in paradise. Yeah, but
they have crazy animals down there today.

3088
02:50:35,971 --> 02:50:38,910
Do giant spiders and shit.
But the people are cool as fuck man.

3089
02:50:38,911 --> 02:50:41,910
It's like a weird thing like
somehow or another that worked.

3090
02:50:41,940 --> 02:50:43,950
You've and you've been there
right a bunch of times. Yeah.

3091
02:50:43,951 --> 02:50:47,550
I love Australia like we do down there.
What you should do, stand up down there.

3092
02:50:47,551 --> 02:50:51,060
Maybe you should start your tour.
We ask it, hey, go do the things.

3093
02:50:51,061 --> 02:50:54,270
I have no income really. Right.
Just so now. Yeah. That's for now.

3094
02:50:54,300 --> 02:50:59,100
That's the tough thing is that I'm staying
up that hostile really like brought

3095
02:50:59,101 --> 02:51:02,760
things into perspective. It's like
snoring, farting. That's what I'm saying.

3096
02:51:03,210 --> 02:51:07,770
People just like standing in
for me, but naked. I'm like,
Hey, um, hey, whatever. Hey.

3097
02:51:07,890 --> 02:51:11,610
You know, it's just crazy. It's crazy.
Grow up man. Crazy world. Listen, dude,

3098
02:51:11,640 --> 02:51:14,870
I gotta wrap this up, but it's
been a pleasure. I'm really
glad we did it. So am I.

3099
02:51:14,910 --> 02:51:16,710
Then I had a feeling was
going to work out this way.

3100
02:51:16,740 --> 02:51:19,710
