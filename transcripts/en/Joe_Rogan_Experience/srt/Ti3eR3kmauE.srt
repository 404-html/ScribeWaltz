1
00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:02,490
The joe rogan experience.

2
00:00:03,540 --> 00:00:05,210
Joe Rogan podcast by night.

3
00:00:05,610 --> 00:00:06,443
All Day.

4
00:00:11,710 --> 00:00:12,560
You're recharging.

5
00:00:16,610 --> 00:00:17,443
Retard.

6
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:18,633
Ooh,

7
00:00:19,510 --> 00:00:20,420
Ooh.

8
00:00:22,870 --> 00:00:23,703
All right.

9
00:00:25,010 --> 00:00:26,120
Shane Smith,

10
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:31,240
2013 the soapy is say the last one is
[inaudible] nine three years of all.

11
00:00:32,510 --> 00:00:33,560
Be here to see it.

12
00:00:35,990 --> 00:00:37,260
See you next week.

13
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:44,810
We've got to quit.

14
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:47,950
That was as good as we've ever done.

15
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:51,070
What we should do right now.

16
00:00:51,100 --> 00:00:52,210
Let's move to Seattle.

17
00:00:57,660 --> 00:01:02,660
We should move to the Wilderness area
where they filmed the very first twilight.

18
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:05,193
Be

19
00:01:07,630 --> 00:01:07,850
Good.

20
00:01:07,850 --> 00:01:08,421
I'll tell you though.

21
00:01:08,421 --> 00:01:10,710
As far as how as the fair,

22
00:01:11,130 --> 00:01:13,380
I think that was good though.

23
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:15,510
That was fun.

24
00:01:15,510 --> 00:01:17,400
I don't think we've heard
that about a podcast.

25
00:01:17,490 --> 00:01:18,323
I agree.

26
00:01:18,530 --> 00:01:18,811
I mean,

27
00:01:18,811 --> 00:01:19,980
I know we were fucked up,

28
00:01:19,981 --> 00:01:21,390
but I think that,

29
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:23,480
I think people are going to say that was,

30
00:01:23,481 --> 00:01:24,270
it was really good.

31
00:01:24,270 --> 00:01:27,780
Was there one moment where you felt
like this was the wrong thing to do?

32
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:28,673
No,

33
00:01:28,980 --> 00:01:29,221
no.

34
00:01:29,221 --> 00:01:29,670
It's fine.

35
00:01:29,670 --> 00:01:29,970
No,

36
00:01:29,970 --> 00:01:30,050
it,

37
00:01:30,050 --> 00:01:30,450
it was fun.

38
00:01:30,450 --> 00:01:34,590
That was the damn perfect ride
down the side of a mountain

39
00:01:36,300 --> 00:01:37,133
sledding.

40
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:39,110
Million miles an hour off.

41
00:01:41,330 --> 00:01:43,650
I might be as good as
we're capable of those.

42
00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:44,910
We might go towards higher.

43
00:01:44,911 --> 00:01:49,911
We may have to just do that once a week
and we might have to go skiing for God.

44
00:01:50,060 --> 00:01:51,440
That was like the most,

45
00:01:54,420 --> 00:01:55,253
I think you were,

46
00:01:56,950 --> 00:01:57,783
you were,

47
00:01:58,760 --> 00:01:59,440
you were like,

48
00:01:59,440 --> 00:01:59,611
oh,

49
00:01:59,611 --> 00:02:00,480
I was going to say,

50
00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:05,540
you're like some existential apart from
talks or her people who shouldn't even

51
00:02:05,611 --> 00:02:07,530
fucking know what existentialism is.

52
00:02:07,810 --> 00:02:08,290
Well,

53
00:02:08,290 --> 00:02:10,800
don't I always explain the
way you know some of them,

54
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:12,350
like they get deep enough.

55
00:02:12,370 --> 00:02:13,500
So let me explain myself.

56
00:02:13,650 --> 00:02:13,911
Sorry,

57
00:02:13,911 --> 00:02:14,744
I'm the,

58
00:02:14,810 --> 00:02:17,090
I'm the bridge between
the meatheads and upon.

59
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:18,810
That's exactly my bread.

60
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:19,910
And by the way,

61
00:02:20,330 --> 00:02:21,170
people out there,

62
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:25,550
your audience understands that we're
doing shit in a different way and you're

63
00:02:25,551 --> 00:02:26,384
doing shit.

64
00:02:26,810 --> 00:02:27,680
That's fucking awesome.

65
00:02:27,890 --> 00:02:29,930
You're going to Munster off
to do the fucking fight.

66
00:02:30,550 --> 00:02:32,900
But at the same time you
here doing fucking podcast.

67
00:02:32,901 --> 00:02:37,430
Talk to me about how the fuck
no one's ever done that before.

68
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:40,640
I don't believe no one's ever done it
before in the history of frumpy media.

69
00:02:40,820 --> 00:02:41,241
Yeah,

70
00:02:41,241 --> 00:02:43,760
but it's not because it wasn't there.

71
00:02:45,890 --> 00:02:47,000
I don't think it's been there.

72
00:02:47,430 --> 00:02:48,390
Why did they,

73
00:02:48,391 --> 00:02:49,224
I don't think he's been there.

74
00:02:50,830 --> 00:02:55,830
I honestly believe that closure of the
exposure two information gets broader and

75
00:02:59,710 --> 00:03:04,710
we're all going to get swept into this
sort of wave of information and wave of

76
00:03:05,141 --> 00:03:06,190
exposure to information.

77
00:03:06,191 --> 00:03:11,191
I think concentrating on
where the information is
being tuned into or where it's

78
00:03:11,861 --> 00:03:13,180
being drawn,

79
00:03:13,181 --> 00:03:15,380
cast is not

80
00:03:17,020 --> 00:03:18,130
the most important thing.

81
00:03:18,131 --> 00:03:19,960
What you're doing has never been done.

82
00:03:20,620 --> 00:03:21,760
Yes and no.

83
00:03:21,850 --> 00:03:23,110
You don't never be done,

84
00:03:23,111 --> 00:03:26,170
but you know you've never
had four g internet before.

85
00:03:26,350 --> 00:03:29,350
I don't know how that boy who
is doing what you're doing,

86
00:03:29,550 --> 00:03:30,383
it has never been.

87
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:31,530
I understand.

88
00:03:31,531 --> 00:03:32,830
I mean it's fucking fantastic.

89
00:03:33,060 --> 00:03:33,540
Yeah,

90
00:03:33,540 --> 00:03:34,181
I understand,

91
00:03:34,181 --> 00:03:35,260
but it's not.

92
00:03:35,470 --> 00:03:39,910
It's all we're doing is letting
me know shit that's happening.

93
00:03:40,070 --> 00:03:41,200
Do it was not as,

94
00:03:41,201 --> 00:03:44,530
not a lot of doing because it's
never been done and it's fantastic.

95
00:03:44,710 --> 00:03:44,910
No,

96
00:03:44,910 --> 00:03:46,470
I said that the last podcast.

97
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:48,890
I couldn't say it then.

98
00:03:48,910 --> 00:03:49,743
That'd be it.

99
00:03:50,170 --> 00:03:53,150
But what you're doing is that it's fine.

100
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:53,631
Well,

101
00:03:53,631 --> 00:03:56,240
we're lucky that we're
in a position to do it,

102
00:03:56,270 --> 00:03:59,120
but it's with what anybody would do.

103
00:03:59,580 --> 00:04:04,460
They logically look to the
situation and realize this or

104
00:04:06,110 --> 00:04:06,590
no,

105
00:04:06,590 --> 00:04:08,150
you're doing a man.

106
00:04:08,151 --> 00:04:10,760
What you're doing has never been done.

107
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:11,481
Yeah,

108
00:04:11,481 --> 00:04:14,870
but it's not because it's
that hard or it's that is.

109
00:04:14,871 --> 00:04:17,220
There's no resistance to doing Brian,

110
00:04:17,270 --> 00:04:18,290
here's the reality,

111
00:04:18,291 --> 00:04:18,770
right?

112
00:04:18,770 --> 00:04:21,110
I don't feel any resistance
to doing this this way.

113
00:04:21,111 --> 00:04:22,860
Do you know

114
00:04:24,380 --> 00:04:25,250
this is the Austin?

115
00:04:25,650 --> 00:04:26,150
How?

116
00:04:26,150 --> 00:04:29,630
How have you been doing
what you guys are doing?

117
00:04:29,930 --> 00:04:30,351
How's that?

118
00:04:30,351 --> 00:04:31,184
Never been done?

119
00:04:35,020 --> 00:04:35,841
Look at Howard Stern.

120
00:04:35,841 --> 00:04:39,230
Howard stern used to be the
uncensored king of all media.

121
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:40,153
Nowadays,

122
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:44,540
he's like fucking TV news compared to
like what podcast can I say one thing?

123
00:04:45,810 --> 00:04:48,410
You're a guy who's like you already.

124
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:49,500
You've made your shit.

125
00:04:49,950 --> 00:04:50,710
You got your shit,

126
00:04:50,710 --> 00:04:51,720
you got your gigs,

127
00:04:52,050 --> 00:04:52,883
you got all your stuff,

128
00:04:52,950 --> 00:04:56,340
and you're taking that and you're
using that to do something different.

129
00:04:56,730 --> 00:04:59,460
Something that no one's
ever done before and listen,

130
00:04:59,940 --> 00:05:00,773
no man,

131
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:00,931
no.

132
00:05:00,931 --> 00:05:03,620
Press that button all until it beeps,

133
00:05:04,820 --> 00:05:05,500
beeps,

134
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:05,770
you know,

135
00:05:05,770 --> 00:05:07,820
hotel last women don't,

136
00:05:07,821 --> 00:05:08,890
don't even breathing yet.

137
00:05:08,891 --> 00:05:09,724
Keep squeezing.

138
00:05:10,780 --> 00:05:11,800
Keep it together.

139
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:13,473
Won't,

140
00:05:14,470 --> 00:05:15,260
don't get anything.

141
00:05:15,260 --> 00:05:16,110
I'll just squeeze it.

142
00:05:16,180 --> 00:05:16,481
Don't,

143
00:05:16,481 --> 00:05:17,440
don't even stock yet.

144
00:05:18,130 --> 00:05:18,760
Hold,

145
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:19,390
squeeze,

146
00:05:19,390 --> 00:05:20,080
squeeze,

147
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:20,913
hold,

148
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:21,753
hold,

149
00:05:21,790 --> 00:05:22,623
hold.

150
00:05:22,980 --> 00:05:24,600
Is he the woods and the roads

151
00:05:27,380 --> 00:05:28,041
shut up by the way,

152
00:05:28,041 --> 00:05:28,874
thing for birds.

153
00:05:29,780 --> 00:05:31,070
I love that

154
00:05:32,820 --> 00:05:36,170
you made your money made
make with other people,

155
00:05:36,530 --> 00:05:37,251
George Clooney,

156
00:05:37,251 --> 00:05:38,084
everyone goes up.

157
00:05:40,610 --> 00:05:45,300
You actually go out there and you put
people on your fucking podcast as fucking

158
00:05:45,301 --> 00:05:47,390
important is fucking important.

159
00:05:47,630 --> 00:05:48,390
Well,

160
00:05:48,390 --> 00:05:49,610
I know we've talked about this.

161
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:51,340
I don't care what you say.

162
00:05:51,950 --> 00:05:53,720
It's fucking important when you're doing,

163
00:05:54,050 --> 00:05:54,830
and by the way,

164
00:05:54,830 --> 00:05:55,880
do you have a huge audience,

165
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:56,960
which is fucking,

166
00:05:57,530 --> 00:05:59,870
and what we're talking
about a lot of it's weird,

167
00:06:00,290 --> 00:06:03,980
but a lot of it is we're talking about
shit to no one knows I'm talking about,

168
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:05,040
come on.

169
00:06:05,050 --> 00:06:05,400
Yes,

170
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:05,960
yes,

171
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:06,793
yes,

172
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:07,450
yes.

173
00:06:07,450 --> 00:06:08,000
Okay.

174
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:08,451
Yes,

175
00:06:08,451 --> 00:06:09,284
I did fine,

176
00:06:09,350 --> 00:06:10,670
but it's not,

177
00:06:10,671 --> 00:06:12,710
it looked as a lot of people
that did it before me.

178
00:06:12,711 --> 00:06:15,800
All I did was pick up the ball
and let everybody know that.

179
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:17,990
I think that if you can,

180
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:23,320
if you can justify your position or
your reasoning for looking at things,

181
00:06:23,631 --> 00:06:28,631
if you can talk to a group of strangers
and manic and be honest about where

182
00:06:28,821 --> 00:06:29,690
you're coming from,

183
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:32,070
that it's important to do well.

184
00:06:32,090 --> 00:06:36,050
I think it's important just
to have a point of view that,

185
00:06:36,051 --> 00:06:36,311
uh,

186
00:06:36,311 --> 00:06:36,601
that,

187
00:06:36,601 --> 00:06:41,601
that makes sense with the information
you've been allowed to have access to.

188
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:47,990
But if you've been allowed to have access
to a lot of shit and you kind of made

189
00:06:47,991 --> 00:06:51,480
mistakes or they fucked up and you
see people making the same mistakes,

190
00:06:51,670 --> 00:06:54,160
it's really important to step up and look,

191
00:06:54,310 --> 00:06:55,143
where are you?

192
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:56,130
Yes.

193
00:06:56,130 --> 00:06:57,400
Don't worry to,

194
00:06:57,570 --> 00:07:00,760
we're just fucking trying to just
say we're fucking regular again.

195
00:07:01,180 --> 00:07:02,690
You're not going to have a bunch of,

196
00:07:02,860 --> 00:07:03,220
right.

197
00:07:03,220 --> 00:07:04,340
You're a fucking dude.

198
00:07:04,580 --> 00:07:05,480
You made your shit.

199
00:07:05,690 --> 00:07:07,250
You fucking hit your fucking thing.

200
00:07:07,430 --> 00:07:08,290
But still you're,

201
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:08,620
you're,

202
00:07:08,620 --> 00:07:10,900
you're doing these
podcasts and by the way,

203
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:11,993
every time

204
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:16,880
the fewer of positivity that comes up,

205
00:07:17,060 --> 00:07:17,893
I'm going to say this,

206
00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:21,280
we talked about a lot of fucked
up shit and these people are like,

207
00:07:21,550 --> 00:07:22,383
what?

208
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:24,280
You're fucking at least your tone.

209
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:26,000
The partners who might be wasted,

210
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:29,090
we might be fucked up
movie talking crazy shit,

211
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:32,600
but in fact they're saying you don't
want your fucking gentleman the truth,

212
00:07:32,601 --> 00:07:33,590
and I'm going to say this,

213
00:07:33,980 --> 00:07:34,813
that's important.

214
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:36,920
That's fucking important.

215
00:07:37,790 --> 00:07:39,080
I agree with you.

216
00:07:39,230 --> 00:07:44,230
I think it's important whenever people
express the ideas of a sort of universal

217
00:07:46,941 --> 00:07:48,260
French people who follow,

218
00:07:48,261 --> 00:07:49,094
you

219
00:07:50,750 --> 00:07:55,190
are the people we need
because what they're doing,

220
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:57,230
they're afraid they curved or fortune.

221
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:58,010
People are saying,

222
00:07:58,010 --> 00:08:00,320
fuck everything called the bullshit.

223
00:08:01,610 --> 00:08:05,910
I've never had a more positive reaction.

224
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:07,510
Anything I've ever done

225
00:08:09,420 --> 00:08:10,253
this fucking

226
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:13,920
great.

227
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:14,880
But it's bizarre.

228
00:08:14,890 --> 00:08:15,650
It's bizarre.

229
00:08:15,650 --> 00:08:16,483
It's great.

230
00:08:16,490 --> 00:08:17,510
It is great,

231
00:08:17,660 --> 00:08:19,550
but is also bizarre.

232
00:08:20,210 --> 00:08:25,210
It's great in the fact that it's a how
about how you have the full MMA guys are

233
00:08:27,141 --> 00:08:29,110
the freest thinkers we have out there.

234
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:31,400
You would think that that's unusual,

235
00:08:31,430 --> 00:08:34,730
but me as a guy who's done
martial arts or whole life,

236
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:35,520
uh,

237
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:37,390
I think that it's a,

238
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:39,170
that's how it's supposed to be,

239
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:44,400
but I think it's not a mistake and not
a coincidence that the very best guys at

240
00:08:45,050 --> 00:08:50,050
the top of the heat or also what I would
consider martial artists like Anderson

241
00:08:51,410 --> 00:08:52,243
Silva beforehand,

242
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:54,200
the homeless,

243
00:08:54,420 --> 00:08:56,690
different spot in the

244
00:08:59,690 --> 00:09:01,230
are going to happen.

245
00:09:01,530 --> 00:09:01,961
Listen.

246
00:09:01,961 --> 00:09:06,440
And Nick Diaz is how my life that I like

247
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:10,440
mother pass this.

248
00:09:10,441 --> 00:09:11,160
Brian.

249
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:12,180
No,

250
00:09:12,510 --> 00:09:13,343
not at all.

251
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:15,250
Not at all.

252
00:09:15,870 --> 00:09:17,190
Diaz guys,

253
00:09:18,210 --> 00:09:19,043
listen,

254
00:09:19,110 --> 00:09:21,180
I love both of these guys.

255
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:26,240
I love George and I love nick and I look
of fight and I love the idea behind it

256
00:09:26,391 --> 00:09:28,980
because the idea behind is you
taking the very best in the world,

257
00:09:30,710 --> 00:09:31,543
best in the world.

258
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:36,560
These guys are the Iliad GSP because
he seems like he's also a bunch of,

259
00:09:43,170 --> 00:09:46,800
he is also a real martial artists.

260
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:49,230
The Way Anderson Silva is,

261
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:50,350
you know the way we know them,

262
00:09:50,370 --> 00:09:51,990
the Cheetah is the way,

263
00:09:51,991 --> 00:09:53,520
even John Jones,

264
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:55,950
I love Jon Jones.

265
00:09:56,580 --> 00:09:59,340
They aspire to be martial arts.

266
00:09:59,341 --> 00:10:00,174
I've been watching

267
00:10:03,330 --> 00:10:04,163
UFC

268
00:10:05,710 --> 00:10:06,543
fight land is

269
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:09,280
the very first step.

270
00:10:09,281 --> 00:10:12,450
So Dustin employee and
worked on the carpet.

271
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:14,830
Just stories I understanding,

272
00:10:14,860 --> 00:10:15,410
you know,

273
00:10:15,410 --> 00:10:17,970
how are we doing a good job when
we show we did an amazing job.

274
00:10:18,270 --> 00:10:18,601
Listen,

275
00:10:18,601 --> 00:10:19,820
you could tell me for fucking hot.

276
00:10:20,010 --> 00:10:20,730
I would,

277
00:10:20,730 --> 00:10:22,470
I'd like you to know
I'm going to actually,

278
00:10:22,590 --> 00:10:23,130
you know,

279
00:10:23,130 --> 00:10:28,130
tell us and if we're doing something
wrong to tell us because I would listen to

280
00:10:28,381 --> 00:10:30,210
how they look at whatever
you want me to look at it.

281
00:10:30,211 --> 00:10:31,430
If you ever want to meet you too,

282
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:32,850
I'll be very happy.

283
00:10:32,851 --> 00:10:35,140
I want you to say I'm
want to do it so I'm fine

284
00:10:36,710 --> 00:10:38,970
whenever you want want to do this.

285
00:10:38,971 --> 00:10:41,540
I'm saying if I just don't
want to be a shithead off.

286
00:10:41,550 --> 00:10:42,900
I like cause our guys they love.

287
00:10:44,340 --> 00:10:49,340
How about you and me do a breakdown
of the individual martial arts.

288
00:10:50,980 --> 00:10:54,690
What I would love if people would do
whatever and weaker and highway 83 love

289
00:10:54,770 --> 00:10:55,430
whatever.

290
00:10:55,430 --> 00:10:57,150
Let's tell you why.

291
00:10:58,140 --> 00:11:00,960
Because I think what we have to do,

292
00:11:00,970 --> 00:11:02,280
what our job is,

293
00:11:02,690 --> 00:11:04,330
when we do escape surf,

294
00:11:05,250 --> 00:11:08,540
we took core and we did with the PDF

295
00:11:10,820 --> 00:11:14,070
and indeed we're doing
it now with the soccer.

296
00:11:14,550 --> 00:11:14,791
We,

297
00:11:14,791 --> 00:11:19,510
we take core core MMA
fans of the craziest fans,

298
00:11:20,270 --> 00:11:21,800
but we have to take it to crossover,

299
00:11:22,170 --> 00:11:22,540
right?

300
00:11:22,540 --> 00:11:26,880
To take it to cross over to
other people and what you are,

301
00:11:26,910 --> 00:11:29,460
you're the best crossover
guy in the fucking world.

302
00:11:29,461 --> 00:11:33,010
Cause you're saying I'm an MMA guy
but I'm actually smarter than no shit.

303
00:11:33,011 --> 00:11:34,860
And if I could talk about
the fucking philosophy,

304
00:11:35,390 --> 00:11:36,121
my advice.

305
00:11:36,121 --> 00:11:36,954
Ready?

306
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:37,600
Yes.

307
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:38,640
Forget it all.

308
00:11:38,980 --> 00:11:39,813
Ignore it.

309
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:42,990
Do it to like put it on what you're like,

310
00:11:43,140 --> 00:11:44,340
forget all the bullshit.

311
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:46,410
But whatever it shows,

312
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:51,500
they either you're interested in any
conversation here and I'd love to do is

313
00:11:52,060 --> 00:11:56,200
take it from that of MMA and bring
it up to the crossover and say,

314
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:59,440
this isn't fucking just these guys.

315
00:11:59,950 --> 00:12:03,070
It's like if you look at
John Jones and you say,

316
00:12:03,190 --> 00:12:04,023
okay,

317
00:12:04,180 --> 00:12:05,590
this guy is a fucking ease,

318
00:12:05,591 --> 00:12:06,430
Muhammad Ali,

319
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:07,630
he's the,

320
00:12:07,630 --> 00:12:09,030
he's the modern day Bahama.

321
00:12:09,340 --> 00:12:13,060
The only difference between him and
Muhammad Ali because he doesn't have 50

322
00:12:13,061 --> 00:12:14,070
fucking documentaries.

323
00:12:15,010 --> 00:12:16,270
I'm a boring,

324
00:12:16,630 --> 00:12:17,110
no,

325
00:12:17,110 --> 00:12:18,140
I'm trying to figure out what it was,

326
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:22,070
but the different things on,

327
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:25,260
so he has massive,

328
00:12:25,830 --> 00:12:30,830
just unbelievable like fountains in
mountains and fields of potential,

329
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:34,673
but he's only,

330
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:38,750
but when I saw him fighting for,

331
00:12:39,530 --> 00:12:42,140
I think it's 25 but when I saw him fight,

332
00:12:42,170 --> 00:12:42,651
I was like,

333
00:12:42,651 --> 00:12:47,240
this guy is so far ahead of everybody
else and he's so much better than

334
00:12:47,241 --> 00:12:47,840
everybody else.

335
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:49,770
But also his stories guy.

336
00:12:49,830 --> 00:12:50,900
He's a smart guy.

337
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:54,710
And the whole thing of like
when he won the championship,

338
00:12:55,030 --> 00:12:57,840
the choking out the person.

339
00:12:58,260 --> 00:13:00,660
Like it was like two hours.

340
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:02,713
And I'm like,

341
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:03,800
yeah,

342
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:04,610
right.

343
00:13:04,610 --> 00:13:05,151
And I'm like,

344
00:13:05,151 --> 00:13:05,631
okay,

345
00:13:05,631 --> 00:13:07,310
if we had that on film,

346
00:13:07,311 --> 00:13:11,980
this is what we sold to
two UFC is we should have,

347
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:14,900
we should have had him
choking out a fucking purse.

348
00:13:14,900 --> 00:13:18,460
Snatcher in New Jersey before he
went to went the fucking check.

349
00:13:18,750 --> 00:13:19,250
Right.

350
00:13:19,250 --> 00:13:23,510
You mean if you guys were there while
he was exactly right now and now we have

351
00:13:23,511 --> 00:13:24,344
that access.

352
00:13:24,450 --> 00:13:24,760
Right.

353
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:29,760
My whole thing is for anybody who
does and you sell them on Ebay doesn't

354
00:13:29,771 --> 00:13:30,130
understand.

355
00:13:30,130 --> 00:13:35,130
We're talking about Jon Jones before
he fought for the UFC light heavyweight

356
00:13:35,141 --> 00:13:35,770
title,

357
00:13:35,770 --> 00:13:37,720
like the day of the fight,

358
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:42,840
it was meditating in a park in New Jersey
and he saw some guys snatch someone's

359
00:13:43,961 --> 00:13:48,010
purse and he was crying like Spiderman,

360
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:50,530
like literally like Peter Parker.

361
00:13:50,531 --> 00:13:51,364
Literally.

362
00:13:51,370 --> 00:13:54,700
He went over and he took down this,

363
00:13:55,190 --> 00:13:56,023
so he crossed it out.

364
00:13:56,410 --> 00:13:57,800
He ran after him.

365
00:13:58,450 --> 00:14:00,950
Choke him out in mid stride.

366
00:14:01,130 --> 00:14:01,491
Yeah,

367
00:14:01,491 --> 00:14:02,324
of course.

368
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:07,060
The purse bag then to thank you very
much and went on to win the fucking shit

369
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:08,000
and you're like,

370
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:08,833
hold on a second.

371
00:14:09,020 --> 00:14:09,853
Hold on a second.

372
00:14:10,010 --> 00:14:13,660
That's the greatest
story in fighting ever.

373
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:15,380
Reverse Parker,

374
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:16,370
let the,

375
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:19,730
the the criminal past five and
then he killed his uncle Ben.

376
00:14:20,020 --> 00:14:23,700
And that's what haunted Peter
Parker and make him be so,

377
00:14:23,701 --> 00:14:28,701
and this guy is literally like Muhammad
Ali going to go fight for his title.

378
00:14:29,210 --> 00:14:32,150
He choked down to fucking
prison in New Jersey.

379
00:14:32,870 --> 00:14:33,680
Yeah.

380
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:34,460
Choked him out,

381
00:14:34,460 --> 00:14:38,390
gave him to the cops and said two hours
later I'm going to go fucking fight for

382
00:14:38,391 --> 00:14:39,470
the championship of the world.

383
00:14:39,710 --> 00:14:40,610
And by the way,

384
00:14:40,670 --> 00:14:41,390
one,

385
00:14:41,390 --> 00:14:43,580
and I'm going to say that's a great story.

386
00:14:43,820 --> 00:14:44,690
It's a great story.

387
00:14:45,140 --> 00:14:50,140
But that was going on free to go to
go one more step you with what you do,

388
00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:51,973
fear factor,

389
00:14:52,370 --> 00:14:54,150
what you've done with MMA,

390
00:14:54,710 --> 00:14:55,221
what you've done,

391
00:14:55,221 --> 00:14:55,730
what you should,

392
00:14:55,730 --> 00:14:59,660
and still doing these podcasts is fucking,

393
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:02,780
that's very important.

394
00:15:03,650 --> 00:15:05,630
It's very important.

395
00:15:05,810 --> 00:15:06,560
And by the way,

396
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:07,880
if you say it's not important,

397
00:15:07,910 --> 00:15:10,370
I'm going to punch you in the salmon work.

398
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:13,270
No cause you're [inaudible]

399
00:15:14,910 --> 00:15:16,020
need conscious.

400
00:15:16,380 --> 00:15:17,011
I'm not afraid of,

401
00:15:17,011 --> 00:15:19,470
you need a lot of efforts.

402
00:15:20,670 --> 00:15:21,490
Let's say aim.

403
00:15:21,490 --> 00:15:22,590
And I just say this then

404
00:15:23,190 --> 00:15:24,050
I respect you.

405
00:15:25,410 --> 00:15:26,243
I respect you.

406
00:15:26,660 --> 00:15:27,470
I,

407
00:15:27,470 --> 00:15:27,780
I,

408
00:15:27,780 --> 00:15:28,613
I,

409
00:15:28,870 --> 00:15:33,030
I completely respect the idea
that you're trying to put for,

410
00:15:33,330 --> 00:15:35,530
I respect and I respect,

411
00:15:36,030 --> 00:15:37,710

412
00:15:37,711 --> 00:15:37,920
right?

413
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:38,370
Yes,

414
00:15:38,370 --> 00:15:38,770
yes,

415
00:15:38,770 --> 00:15:39,603
yes.

416
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:57,153
Okay.

417
00:16:09,630 --> 00:16:09,680
Yeah.
