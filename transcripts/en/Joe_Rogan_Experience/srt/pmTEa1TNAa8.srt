1
00:00:02,130 --> 00:00:04,860
Was Jamie here the last time I
was here or was that, oh, okay.

2
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:08,580
It's remarkable. In many experience.

3
00:00:10,120 --> 00:00:14,740
Joe Rogan podcast by night
darkness.

4
00:00:16,610 --> 00:00:19,460
That's Jamie. We're talking
about antiquarian. Welcome.

5
00:00:20,980 --> 00:00:24,160
Like from here,
she brought Mr Ana Kasparian,

6
00:00:25,270 --> 00:00:29,860
the boyfriend's here. So all you all, you
sad dude's at home, don't like Eh. No,

7
00:00:30,330 --> 00:00:33,600
no, no. It's never gonna happen. Now
she's got a boyfriend. She's here.

8
00:00:33,870 --> 00:00:34,890
Were boozing it up too.

9
00:00:35,030 --> 00:00:37,940
Well, he's gotta be on his a game
at all times because I don't know,

10
00:00:37,941 --> 00:00:38,774
maybe it could have

11
00:00:41,720 --> 00:00:46,610
terrible way to start a podcast.
He's amazing. He is amazing.

12
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:51,310
He's wearing pajamas, nighttime.
Just give a fuck. I like it.

13
00:00:51,610 --> 00:00:56,300
Plus it's Cuban. I've got a big respect
for Cubans. So, uh, yeah, we're,

14
00:00:56,301 --> 00:00:57,770
we're back with Cuba,
right?

15
00:00:57,800 --> 00:01:00,470
Isn't that the new thing that's going
to be able to go over and get some nice

16
00:01:00,471 --> 00:01:01,304
cigars now?

17
00:01:01,450 --> 00:01:04,270
Yeah. No, Congress needs
to get involved. Right.

18
00:01:04,271 --> 00:01:06,970
And Obama can't unilaterally
lift the embargo.

19
00:01:06,971 --> 00:01:09,370
But I think that overall
this is good news.

20
00:01:09,371 --> 00:01:11,800
And I know that there are Cubans in Miami
that her against this and they think

21
00:01:11,801 --> 00:01:13,990
it's a terrible idea.
But look,

22
00:01:13,991 --> 00:01:17,560
the embargo lasted 52 years
and it didn't end communism.

23
00:01:17,561 --> 00:01:19,540
It just strengthened the Castro regime so

24
00:01:19,660 --> 00:01:20,830
well made things really weird.

25
00:01:20,860 --> 00:01:24,610
You ever look at those photos of Cuba
and you see the 1950s cars that they

26
00:01:24,611 --> 00:01:27,460
evolve fixed up.
It's kind of fascinating.

27
00:01:27,550 --> 00:01:31,960
It really is. I mean, when you can't
import vehicles from the United States,

28
00:01:31,961 --> 00:01:34,780
you know, you gotta keep up
with the vehicles that you have.

29
00:01:34,781 --> 00:01:37,900
So they are in perfect,
impeccable condition.

30
00:01:38,940 --> 00:01:39,721
It's crazy.

31
00:01:39,721 --> 00:01:44,130
It's weird to watch like you see like a
red light and as these photos of these

32
00:01:44,131 --> 00:01:48,570
cars into like beautiful, like classic
cars that are all in great shape,

33
00:01:48,950 --> 00:01:49,170
you know,

34
00:01:49,170 --> 00:01:52,800
and makes you realize like we're kind
of trapped in this cycle of constantly

35
00:01:52,801 --> 00:01:57,540
getting new shit, constantly getting
the, oh it's a 2016 Lexus, you know,

36
00:01:57,541 --> 00:01:59,550
we get so excited about the
new one or the new ones.

37
00:01:59,551 --> 00:02:01,890
Headlights move when you move like,
Oh fucking Christ.

38
00:02:02,180 --> 00:02:06,900
Like we could get by with these 1950s
cars and we really wanted to set the brake

39
00:02:06,901 --> 00:02:09,060
suck in the suspension sucks.

40
00:02:09,470 --> 00:02:12,290
Look,
I'm not an expert in cars at all,

41
00:02:12,291 --> 00:02:16,850
but I will say that the vehicles that
are being built now won't last as long as

42
00:02:16,851 --> 00:02:19,970
the cars that were built in like the
1950s like do you think a car that was

43
00:02:19,971 --> 00:02:21,370
built in 19 I'm sorry,

44
00:02:21,380 --> 00:02:25,250
2014 is going to last 40
years or even a few decades.

45
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:27,590
I wonder,
I don't know.

46
00:02:27,620 --> 00:02:30,860
I don't know enough to say whether
or not they're really built better.

47
00:02:30,861 --> 00:02:31,730
I just think they were,

48
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:36,880
there's a weird thing that happened
between like 1960 and then into the 1970s

49
00:02:37,911 --> 00:02:40,130
and eighties where cars just sucked.

50
00:02:40,730 --> 00:02:45,730
And like in the 1960s like between like
1964 65 like the old Corvettes and going

51
00:02:47,151 --> 00:02:51,830
into like the muscle cars are the classic
1967 Camaro's of those kinds of cars.

52
00:02:52,190 --> 00:02:55,220
Those are some of the best looking cars
human beings have ever figured out.

53
00:02:55,670 --> 00:03:00,670
And they had this weird sort of like
flair to them that you just don't get from

54
00:03:01,091 --> 00:03:04,390
cars that came from the 90s. Like
those cars look like shit. Like I was,

55
00:03:04,630 --> 00:03:07,270
we were watching this auction
once and uh, they had, uh,

56
00:03:07,330 --> 00:03:08,450
we talked about on the podcast,

57
00:03:08,470 --> 00:03:11,920
don't worry about the Camaro that was for
sale and they had a Camaro for several

58
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:15,610
year, 2002 Camaro and everybody's
like, kit, that fucking
piece of Shit Outta here.

59
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:19,570
Nobody cares about a 12 year
old Camaro kid out of here. Wow.

60
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:24,280
But like a 30, 40 year old Camaro
is that shit. Yup. You know,

61
00:03:24,281 --> 00:03:27,470
so somehow or another we like,
we,

62
00:03:27,471 --> 00:03:31,180
we entered into this era where people
don't want to fix those things up.

63
00:03:31,210 --> 00:03:34,780
You just want to get rid of them. Like
there's like pockets where people like,

64
00:03:34,781 --> 00:03:37,810
you know, you don't fix up a 2002
Camaro. Get rid of that fucking, yeah.

65
00:03:37,830 --> 00:03:39,470
Thanks. Yeah. That's so true. Um,

66
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:43,450
there was a neighbor I had that
had this amazing Red Mustang.

67
00:03:43,451 --> 00:03:44,770
I don't know which year it was,

68
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:50,040
but it was just such a beautifully crafted
vehicle and I compared that classic

69
00:03:50,441 --> 00:03:53,020
car to the mustangs that
are being built today.

70
00:03:53,050 --> 00:03:57,190
And I felt like there was no comparison.
There was something sexy about that car.

71
00:03:57,191 --> 00:04:00,400
And the mustangs are sexy today too,
but not to the same extent.

72
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:04,270
Do you know it has like the curves of a
woman almost when you look at a Mustang

73
00:04:04,271 --> 00:04:05,350
from decades ago.

74
00:04:05,820 --> 00:04:09,120
Yeah. So they figured something
out. Yeah. I don't know what it is,

75
00:04:09,150 --> 00:04:12,600
but they figured something out from like
in the 1960s where they figured out how

76
00:04:12,601 --> 00:04:16,080
to make these cars just like, whoa. You
look at them. This is just classic shape.

77
00:04:16,110 --> 00:04:17,640
Yeah.
I think that's coming back though.

78
00:04:18,210 --> 00:04:21,300
I think the last few
generations of American cars,

79
00:04:21,330 --> 00:04:24,240
they've really figured out like some
of the new Cadillacs are beautiful.

80
00:04:24,270 --> 00:04:28,080
They really are incredible. So
I recently leased a new car, um,

81
00:04:28,081 --> 00:04:32,820
and I settled on a BMW and it's a
great car. It's a little three series.

82
00:04:32,821 --> 00:04:33,120
Um,

83
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:37,890
I really wanted like a white exterior
with red interior cause I'm an Armenian.

84
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:43,890
But um, it's in the blood. Yeah, it is.
It's in the blood. We like flashy shit.

85
00:04:44,820 --> 00:04:48,600
So it was funny because I
remember talking to Christian,

86
00:04:48,601 --> 00:04:53,580
my boyfriend about possibly
getting a Cadillac and he was like,

87
00:04:53,581 --> 00:04:54,660
yeah,
it kind of locks are cool.

88
00:04:54,661 --> 00:04:59,400
But they still kind of have like the old
man stigma attached to them even though

89
00:04:59,401 --> 00:05:00,240
they're beautiful.

90
00:05:00,740 --> 00:05:03,080
Yeah, they do a little bit. Right. Yeah.

91
00:05:03,081 --> 00:05:06,410
Even though the new ones that are
spaceshipy, they still have that thing.

92
00:05:06,710 --> 00:05:08,720
It's like for the longest
time that's what they were.

93
00:05:08,820 --> 00:05:11,640
Yeah. But I really have no room
to talk before I got the BMW,

94
00:05:11,641 --> 00:05:16,600
I was driving a Lincoln. Those are very
old manner as they got his old man.

95
00:05:17,670 --> 00:05:20,070
I loved that car.
It was an Mkz hybrid.

96
00:05:21,420 --> 00:05:24,950
It wasn't like a hip car,
but it was smooth. Right.

97
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:26,490
They've adjusted,
you know,

98
00:05:26,491 --> 00:05:28,650
American cars over the last
few years have really adjusted.

99
00:05:28,651 --> 00:05:31,010
Especially it seems like,
especially since, um,

100
00:05:31,230 --> 00:05:33,770
they got all that money to
sort of rebuild, you know,

101
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:37,230
there was like a lot of restructuring
and it just seems like they came out with

102
00:05:37,231 --> 00:05:39,900
some pretty exciting cars,
like some really nice cars now.

103
00:05:40,030 --> 00:05:43,980
Well, they had no choice
after that bailout. You better
fucking deliver. I mean,

104
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:47,850
yeah. Yeah. David made the, in the world
of muscle cars, they've made amazing,

105
00:05:47,851 --> 00:05:50,570
amazing cars.
They have a new Camaro out,

106
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:54,060
z 28 that is like essentially you
could buy a race car from the,

107
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:58,010
from the Chevy dealership. I mean
it's, it's a real car. It's got

108
00:05:58,010 --> 00:06:01,790
500 plus horsepower. It doesn't even have
a radio. It has a speaker on the door.

109
00:06:01,940 --> 00:06:05,030
It doesn't have air conditioning.
It's at this ridiculously,

110
00:06:06,310 --> 00:06:08,600
they wanted to make it as light
as possible. Right. Of course.

111
00:06:09,290 --> 00:06:13,610
Light battery and it's, you
know, but it's insanely like,

112
00:06:14,180 --> 00:06:16,970
like capable,
like for a car that you can just buy.

113
00:06:17,140 --> 00:06:19,460
I mean this thing can run on a track.

114
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:24,230
It pulls like more than one g of its own
bodyweight sideways and it's a Camaro.

115
00:06:24,380 --> 00:06:25,790
Yeah. That, that's impressive.

116
00:06:25,791 --> 00:06:27,920
But I always wonder about
people who buy cars like that.

117
00:06:27,921 --> 00:06:30,470
Like are you really going to
take it to a track? Probably not.

118
00:06:30,471 --> 00:06:32,840
Are you going to drag race it?
You probably shouldn't.

119
00:06:32,930 --> 00:06:36,650
Probably shouldn't, but yeah, even
if you're driving legal speeds,

120
00:06:36,710 --> 00:06:39,770
those cars are way more fun than
regular cars. Yeah, definitely.

121
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:42,830
Even if you're just
getting onto the highway,

122
00:06:42,831 --> 00:06:46,460
just that a moment of
acceleration to merge and

123
00:06:48,170 --> 00:06:51,380
you don't have that in
like a Honda or in a volt.

124
00:06:51,870 --> 00:06:52,770
So I shouldn't,
yeah,

125
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:56,280
I shouldn't be admitting this because
it's probably not a good idea on the road.

126
00:06:56,281 --> 00:06:59,580
But I have like a little bit of road
rage and my least favorite thing on the

127
00:06:59,581 --> 00:07:02,010
planet is when I want to be respectful,

128
00:07:02,011 --> 00:07:06,270
I want to follow the rules and I put
my turn signal on and I want to switch

129
00:07:06,271 --> 00:07:10,440
lanes. Right. And the motherfucker
behind me sees that. I put, sorry,

130
00:07:10,980 --> 00:07:11,581
I put the,

131
00:07:11,581 --> 00:07:16,320
I put the turn signal on or whatever and
he or she starts speeding up so I won't

132
00:07:16,321 --> 00:07:18,300
be able to pass. Right.
And with the Lincoln,

133
00:07:18,301 --> 00:07:20,970
I wasn't able to speed up
enough to like cut them off.

134
00:07:21,180 --> 00:07:23,700
But now at the BMW I'm like,
Oh, you're going to speed up.

135
00:07:23,701 --> 00:07:26,840
Well then I'm going to cut your ass off.
I love it. It's such a good feeling.

136
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:29,750
That's so ridiculous. Why
don't, why don't we do that?

137
00:07:29,810 --> 00:07:32,470
Do you catch yourself doing that?
Like accelerating and then just go,

138
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:36,920
why am I getting involved getting involved
in this? No, no, I never had a war.

139
00:07:36,950 --> 00:07:38,960
I go to war.
That's so crazy.

140
00:07:39,170 --> 00:07:42,320
Don't you think it would be like healthier
for all involved if you just like,

141
00:07:42,780 --> 00:07:44,170
just let,
let this motherfucker,

142
00:07:44,420 --> 00:07:48,200
you do what would be healthy if we all
respect one another's opinions without

143
00:07:48,201 --> 00:07:52,430
getting outraged. If we
were more compassionate and
empathetic, but we're not,

144
00:07:52,431 --> 00:07:57,431
we're animals and we're hateful
and we're not inherently kind.

145
00:07:58,660 --> 00:08:02,370
Don't you think that that's not universal
though? I know a lot of people who are,

146
00:08:02,420 --> 00:08:03,640
don't,
you know a lot of people who are,

147
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:08,500
I know people who are kind and I think
it's of course a mix of nature and

148
00:08:08,501 --> 00:08:11,020
nurture. Right, right. I don't know.

149
00:08:11,021 --> 00:08:14,560
It's funny because I was having
this conversation on um, the point,

150
00:08:14,561 --> 00:08:19,000
which is one of the shows I host for
TYT network. And I said, you know,

151
00:08:19,001 --> 00:08:19,870
doing this job,

152
00:08:19,871 --> 00:08:24,250
and especially this year I started
feeling a little more depressed and it was

153
00:08:24,251 --> 00:08:28,210
because I started realizing that there
are a lot of really bad people out there.

154
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:32,110
You're exposed to it on a regular basis
through the news stories that you cover

155
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:35,350
through the emails you get through the
tweets that you read through the comments

156
00:08:35,351 --> 00:08:40,090
that you see. And it's discouraging.
It's disheartening. And I'm trying,

157
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:41,380
I'm like in a Rut right now.

158
00:08:41,381 --> 00:08:45,160
I'm trying to rise above it and
not let it get to me. But you know,

159
00:08:45,161 --> 00:08:47,980
you hear the police brutality
stories, you hear the, you know,

160
00:08:48,130 --> 00:08:51,250
the cases where people get shot and
killed and there is no justice for them.

161
00:08:51,460 --> 00:08:55,560
You read how people will be supportive
of those types of behaviors. You're like,

162
00:08:55,561 --> 00:08:57,690
what world am I living in?
You know?

163
00:08:58,710 --> 00:09:02,820
Yeah. It's very challenging.
Uh, you're, you're dealing
with insane numbers. I mean,

164
00:09:02,821 --> 00:09:07,650
that's one of the parts of the world
that's so hard to handle and manage and in

165
00:09:07,651 --> 00:09:08,484
this day and age,

166
00:09:08,820 --> 00:09:12,180
so you're dealing with the influence of
billions of people literally now. I mean,

167
00:09:12,181 --> 00:09:12,970
there's,

168
00:09:12,970 --> 00:09:17,070
there's so much news and there's so many
stories that just the sheer numbers of

169
00:09:17,071 --> 00:09:21,090
human beings and then extreme poverty,

170
00:09:21,091 --> 00:09:25,740
extreme disparity and how much people
have and how much advantage they've had

171
00:09:25,741 --> 00:09:27,090
been born in certain situations.

172
00:09:27,091 --> 00:09:31,290
The resentment of that ramp and crime
in your neighborhood growing up in these

173
00:09:31,291 --> 00:09:32,040
neighborhoods.
I mean,

174
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:36,720
there's just so many people and so many
people that just have a shit roll of the

175
00:09:36,721 --> 00:09:39,570
dice. They just got a shit life, you know,

176
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:44,810
and you have to be aware of that and you
kind of have to understand where people

177
00:09:44,811 --> 00:09:46,670
are coming from when they're,
you know,

178
00:09:46,671 --> 00:09:50,180
not necessarily the best people on the
planet, but at the same time, look,

179
00:09:50,181 --> 00:09:54,260
the Internet just exposes you to things
that are way outside your bubble. Right?

180
00:09:54,261 --> 00:09:58,370
So I remember when we covered the
whole ray rice story, um, and you know,

181
00:09:58,371 --> 00:10:03,371
we saw that surveillance footage of him
knocking his fiance out with one punch.

182
00:10:04,130 --> 00:10:07,760
You know, of course we condemn the
action. And a lot of people were like,

183
00:10:07,761 --> 00:10:10,570
what do you mean? What do you mean
you'd, she was, she was mouthing off you.

184
00:10:10,571 --> 00:10:12,680
Did you see what she was doing?
She was charging at him.

185
00:10:12,681 --> 00:10:17,090
And it's like ray rice is a freaking
football player, is much larger than her.

186
00:10:17,150 --> 00:10:20,840
I mean, she can't really do much
damage to him. Right. And so I get the,

187
00:10:20,841 --> 00:10:23,510
I get the argument that, oh,
if someone's attacking you,

188
00:10:23,511 --> 00:10:25,070
you should be able to defend yourself,

189
00:10:25,250 --> 00:10:28,040
but you should also know your own
strength. Right? So we make that argument.

190
00:10:28,041 --> 00:10:30,170
We got so much hate on
those ray rice videos.

191
00:10:30,171 --> 00:10:33,650
It was amazing and I couldn't understand
it and I still don't understand it.

192
00:10:34,410 --> 00:10:38,640
Yeah, that's hard. You know, I
grew up, when I was a little kid,

193
00:10:38,641 --> 00:10:43,641
I saw my dad hit my mom and my mom
moved out like immediately afterwards.

194
00:10:44,550 --> 00:10:46,410
And I'll never forget it.

195
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:50,460
I'll never forget like seeing
that and it's, it's uh,

196
00:10:51,150 --> 00:10:52,410
there's a big difference.

197
00:10:52,830 --> 00:10:57,830
It's like a little kid trying to kick
your ass and so you need him in the face

198
00:10:57,901 --> 00:11:00,490
and knock them unconscious. Like you
wouldn't do that with a little kid. Right.

199
00:11:00,620 --> 00:11:04,650
You'd hold them off. Well, if it's
a woman and you're a 230 pound,

200
00:11:04,651 --> 00:11:07,200
240 pounds super athlete,

201
00:11:07,260 --> 00:11:10,620
I mean a fucking super athlete.

202
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:13,980
He received that guy
run like Jesus Christ.

203
00:11:14,170 --> 00:11:16,730
I haven't seen him run, but I've seen
him knock someone out. The single

204
00:11:17,020 --> 00:11:18,760
it was,
was a nice left hook.

205
00:11:18,820 --> 00:11:22,450
Actually he had good technique like the
way through it and really knows how to

206
00:11:22,451 --> 00:11:24,370
throw a punch because
it was in a short range.

207
00:11:24,670 --> 00:11:27,940
A lot of guys would have wound up too
much and they would have never landed it

208
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:31,420
from, from that position. So as an
analyst it was a very good punt,

209
00:11:32,110 --> 00:11:36,790
but it was rude as fuck that he did that
when she just kind of slapped him in

210
00:11:36,791 --> 00:11:40,300
his head he shouldn't have.
The other thing is,

211
00:11:40,660 --> 00:11:43,410
this is what people don't
like to talk about, but it's,

212
00:11:43,430 --> 00:11:48,430
it's a reality is that guys who've
experienced a lot of head trauma or way

213
00:11:49,031 --> 00:11:50,920
quicker to pull the trigger,

214
00:11:51,130 --> 00:11:54,070
the weight quicker to
react a very impulsive

215
00:11:54,070 --> 00:11:58,330
way. I love that you brought
that up because while we
were discussing that story,

216
00:11:58,331 --> 00:12:03,310
I brought up the potential of all of
the head trauma leading to more violent

217
00:12:03,311 --> 00:12:06,550
behavior and look, I'm not a
neuroscientist. I don't know.

218
00:12:06,551 --> 00:12:08,080
That was just my speculation,

219
00:12:08,081 --> 00:12:10,810
but I think that it's a pretty
good hypothesis that I'd want,

220
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:13,990
I'd want to look into a little further.
But yeah,

221
00:12:14,270 --> 00:12:16,600
real real sports thing on
it recently. No, I haven't.

222
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:20,690
Yeah, they did a piece on it
or they were talking about, um,

223
00:12:20,790 --> 00:12:25,790
people who were like really kindhearted
and normal and very peaceful.

224
00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:28,800
And then once he started playing
football and they experienced a few head

225
00:12:28,801 --> 00:12:33,390
injuries, their personality shifted and
they became like really angry and really

226
00:12:33,391 --> 00:12:34,560
aggressive and really just,

227
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:39,000
and a lot of people think that
it has to do with depression,

228
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:43,170
which is like super common as well for
the guys who experienced some significant

229
00:12:43,171 --> 00:12:44,004
head trauma.

230
00:12:44,070 --> 00:12:48,270
And at this depression might make these
guys like more quick to snap or more

231
00:12:48,271 --> 00:12:52,980
angry or more impulsive.
And that's a lot of,

232
00:12:52,981 --> 00:12:55,260
that's just related to head
trauma. And that's, that's a,

233
00:12:55,261 --> 00:12:57,450
that's a scary reality
that comes with football.

234
00:12:57,550 --> 00:13:01,270
Yeah, I look, I wouldn't be surprised
at, look, I don't watch much UFC stuff.

235
00:13:01,300 --> 00:13:04,780
Actually. I don't watch any, I'm not
going to lie to you, but I know, I know.

236
00:13:04,781 --> 00:13:07,150
But is there a head trauma
involved with that as well? I mean,

237
00:13:07,151 --> 00:13:10,870
you're using your full body
to beat the shit out of
someone. No, no, no, of course.

238
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:14,410
That's the point.
So were you ever surround about that?

239
00:13:15,260 --> 00:13:20,110
Well,
I think for the athletes it's um,

240
00:13:20,210 --> 00:13:24,590
it's a risk that pretty much
everyone is aware of at this point.

241
00:13:25,250 --> 00:13:27,110
And many of them,

242
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:31,790
I think they impose like a
threshold they impose themselves.

243
00:13:31,791 --> 00:13:35,330
Like if I get knocked out too many times,

244
00:13:35,331 --> 00:13:36,800
if I feel like it's happening too much,

245
00:13:36,801 --> 00:13:39,320
but I feel like I can't take a
punch anymore, I'm going to get out.

246
00:13:39,770 --> 00:13:44,550
And a lot of guys have done this and done
this like really intelligently and uh,

247
00:13:44,630 --> 00:13:48,140
made speeches about it and you know,
put a blog entries about it.

248
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:51,860
But it's a common theme
is that these fighters,

249
00:13:51,861 --> 00:13:54,740
they realize at a certain point in
time they're not durable anymore.

250
00:13:54,770 --> 00:13:57,170
They get hit and they get
hurt really bad really easily.

251
00:13:57,860 --> 00:14:00,410
And then they start really being worried.
And that's smart.

252
00:14:00,411 --> 00:14:02,060
The smart thing to do is to get out then.

253
00:14:02,900 --> 00:14:07,370
But unfortunately you can't tell
someone when they can and can't compete.

254
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:12,380
So some guys, they stay too
long and they have those two,

255
00:14:12,381 --> 00:14:15,200
three fights that they probably shouldn't
have had. And those are hard, hard

256
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:16,680
to watch. Well, you know,

257
00:14:16,730 --> 00:14:21,410
we had this discussion about whether or
not in let's say a few decades football

258
00:14:21,411 --> 00:14:25,520
will be outlawed because of
the head trauma that a lot
of these players in door.

259
00:14:25,910 --> 00:14:28,970
And you know,
my argument to that would be,

260
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:33,530
it's not always the answer to ban
things, right? So for instance,

261
00:14:33,531 --> 00:14:37,550
banning marijuana didn't work.
Banning drugs didn't work. Right?

262
00:14:37,700 --> 00:14:41,390
But one thing that you
could do is actually educate
people as much as possible

263
00:14:41,391 --> 00:14:42,081
about,
you know,

264
00:14:42,081 --> 00:14:45,500
the consequences of doing such things
and then they can make an educated

265
00:14:45,501 --> 00:14:47,900
decision about it with the NFL,

266
00:14:48,110 --> 00:14:53,110
the NFL withheld records and studies
from its players so they wouldn't know

267
00:14:53,211 --> 00:14:55,850
about what this head trauma
would do to them in the long run.

268
00:14:56,120 --> 00:14:58,670
And so if I were like a
legislator or something,

269
00:14:58,671 --> 00:15:02,450
I wouldn't advocate for banning
certain sports. But I would say, look,

270
00:15:02,451 --> 00:15:05,390
there needs to be more transparency.
There needs to be more education.

271
00:15:05,570 --> 00:15:07,760
That way people can make
a decision for themselves.

272
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:10,670
Now it's Kinda hard to do that when
you're 18 and you've been drafted out of

273
00:15:10,671 --> 00:15:13,010
high school. But you know, nonetheless,

274
00:15:13,011 --> 00:15:16,820
I feel like more education is the best
way to handle a situation like that.

275
00:15:17,340 --> 00:15:20,850
Well, I think because of the data
that's in now, I think it's undeniable,

276
00:15:20,851 --> 00:15:23,880
but I think for a long time it was one
of those things like when cigarettes

277
00:15:23,881 --> 00:15:25,500
first became illegal,
you know,

278
00:15:25,501 --> 00:15:28,800
there was like a lot of resistance
to make it not illegal rather.

279
00:15:28,801 --> 00:15:31,800
But when the cigarettes, uh, became, uh,

280
00:15:32,340 --> 00:15:34,530
like responsible for cancer,

281
00:15:34,770 --> 00:15:38,700
when they became like responsible and
started having to pay out payments and

282
00:15:38,701 --> 00:15:41,760
having to uh, like did
tobacco, I mean how much,

283
00:15:41,790 --> 00:15:44,770
how much money of tobacco companies
had to pay out in these giant lawsuit.

284
00:15:44,771 --> 00:15:46,440
It's like billions and
billions of dollars,

285
00:15:46,441 --> 00:15:49,050
but they're still making so
much money that it's, it's,

286
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:51,450
it's viable for them
to stay in production.

287
00:15:51,630 --> 00:15:54,960
But at one point in time they were
completely denying that there is there any

288
00:15:54,961 --> 00:15:57,300
link between cigarettes and
cancer. Amazing. They were,

289
00:15:57,330 --> 00:16:00,210
they were literally getting doctors
to prescribe cigarettes. I mean,

290
00:16:00,211 --> 00:16:02,700
that was like a common
prescription for like wheat kids.

291
00:16:02,980 --> 00:16:05,220
They had prescribed that little
fucker cigarettes. Right.

292
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:07,530
I mean,
similar things are happening right now.

293
00:16:07,830 --> 00:16:11,100
Similar things or harming children,
but like guys in their twenties right?

294
00:16:11,460 --> 00:16:14,580
Similar things are happening right now
with pharmaceutical companies and some of

295
00:16:14,581 --> 00:16:16,260
these prescription drugs,
I mean,

296
00:16:16,261 --> 00:16:21,261
things that are being marketed as
harmless are being pushed on kids that

297
00:16:21,601 --> 00:16:24,530
shouldn't be taking pharmaceutical
drugs right now. It's amazing.

298
00:16:24,930 --> 00:16:26,100
Yeah,
it is amazing.

299
00:16:26,130 --> 00:16:31,130
And I think that when the f the football
players have all demonstrated this

300
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:35,660
consistent pattern of brain
trauma, you know, if they,

301
00:16:35,750 --> 00:16:37,980
they kid each other all the time and
they're trying to figure out how to

302
00:16:37,981 --> 00:16:41,580
mitigate that. But along the
way, the data becomes undeniable.

303
00:16:41,581 --> 00:16:43,050
So now they're at that same
spot where they're like,

304
00:16:43,051 --> 00:16:46,170
the tobacco companies were okay,
cigarettes cause cancer,

305
00:16:46,171 --> 00:16:48,150
but we still want it to be
legal, you know? Okay, okay.

306
00:16:48,180 --> 00:16:50,910
Football causes brain damage,
but we still want to play it.

307
00:16:50,940 --> 00:16:53,600
Do you guys still want to play football?
Who wants to make money? Right?

308
00:16:53,601 --> 00:16:56,070
You make money, right? You worried about
getting hit and had a couple of times,

309
00:16:56,190 --> 00:16:58,350
okay, we're going to do our
best to not hit heads together,

310
00:16:58,620 --> 00:17:03,480
but we're playing fucking football because
women are Americans. Yeah. Yeah. Right.

311
00:17:03,510 --> 00:17:07,020
That's what happens and dudes
will fucking march out there, bro.

312
00:17:07,380 --> 00:17:10,680
I'll fucking keep banging heads.
I'll still bang heads.

313
00:17:10,681 --> 00:17:13,710
I'm going to fucking bang heads and
get penalised. Yeah, we're animals.

314
00:17:13,711 --> 00:17:14,544
We're savages.

315
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:19,760
Especially like when you
are just a complete stud
athlete and you're involved in

316
00:17:21,181 --> 00:17:25,680
this ultra competitive world of try to
dominate other stud athletes and spike

317
00:17:25,681 --> 00:17:30,330
balls in their face and
they're just fucking out there.

318
00:17:30,490 --> 00:17:35,200
Yeah, going to play. I got to
admit, I just visualize a stew,

319
00:17:35,201 --> 00:17:38,850
super stud athletes spiking the ball
and I got a little turned off so I can

320
00:17:38,851 --> 00:17:42,730
understand why they do it.
I can understand you imagine that's,

321
00:17:42,740 --> 00:17:44,390
you see what?

322
00:17:44,410 --> 00:17:46,700
I don't watch much football
but I love highlight reels.

323
00:17:46,850 --> 00:17:50,070
I love watching ESPN because they'll
show like the best shit. I don't have

324
00:17:50,070 --> 00:17:53,610
time. I don't understand the downs. I
really don't. I don't even know the rules.

325
00:17:53,970 --> 00:17:56,580
I don't know the rules of football.
Neither do I. So we're on the same boat.

326
00:17:56,610 --> 00:17:59,070
Who's you're calling flags? I'm
like, what is all this rest?

327
00:17:59,100 --> 00:18:02,460
Why is everybody resting?
That should be just constant chaos.

328
00:18:02,610 --> 00:18:05,430
I would want to see it like an MMA
bout. This is too fucking, yeah.

329
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:09,990
Five guys on this side. Five guys in
that side moved the ball, go chaos.

330
00:18:09,991 --> 00:18:13,070
Craziness. No breaks. Yeah.
When you get it across,

331
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:16,770
you fucking march it back the other
way and do it that way. And no breaks,

332
00:18:16,830 --> 00:18:21,000
no breaks, no this whistle blowing. And
that white guy off the fucking field,

333
00:18:21,110 --> 00:18:24,360
a little tiny white guy with the white
outfit, he's going to get killed.

334
00:18:24,420 --> 00:18:27,300
So he's going to accidentally run over
that fucker and he's going to die.

335
00:18:27,770 --> 00:18:31,710
300 pound men on who knows God.

336
00:18:31,711 --> 00:18:36,210
What kind of concoctions that are made
in laboratories that have allowed them to

337
00:18:36,211 --> 00:18:39,600
grow so big. Yeah, I mean I feel the same.

338
00:18:39,601 --> 00:18:43,560
I'm going to sound so stupid to your male
audience because I don't know the ins

339
00:18:43,561 --> 00:18:45,330
and outs of sports.
I'm not a big sports fan,

340
00:18:45,331 --> 00:18:49,650
but that's kind of how I feel about
professional basketball games. Right?

341
00:18:49,651 --> 00:18:52,440
So like I go and see Christian
play basketball and I
love it because they don't

342
00:18:52,441 --> 00:18:54,210
take any breaks and I'm like awesome.

343
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:56,070
I get to watch them play
and I really get into it.

344
00:18:56,310 --> 00:19:00,660
You Watch the NBA and there was like a
freaking timeout called every two minutes

345
00:19:00,990 --> 00:19:04,170
and you're like, Jesus Christ,
just keep playing the game.

346
00:19:04,171 --> 00:19:07,110
And I understand there are good reasons
for it. It's all part of the strategy.

347
00:19:07,380 --> 00:19:10,410
But for someone like me
who's not a big sports fan,

348
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:14,100
I get turned off really quickly because
I'm like, oh great. Next commercial break.

349
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:15,420
All right,
we're going to wait.

350
00:19:15,421 --> 00:19:17,910
Like it loses the momentum of
the game and I lose interest.

351
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:20,000
Well,
for sports fans,

352
00:19:20,001 --> 00:19:24,680
I think what happens is you have these
highs and lows and you just sort of like

353
00:19:24,681 --> 00:19:28,790
settle in through the lows while they're
blown whistles and moving guys over

354
00:19:28,791 --> 00:19:31,220
here and talking about this
and arguing about that.

355
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:35,060
And it gives you things to debate.
Like that's a bullshit call.

356
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:38,660
There's fucking ref to retard and it gives
you shit to talk about when you're at

357
00:19:38,661 --> 00:19:42,110
home. Like I like when a
on Twitter, after fights,

358
00:19:42,290 --> 00:19:44,270
I don't even fucking read comments.

359
00:19:44,271 --> 00:19:48,440
I'm like the last people I want to hear
about his people that didn't like the

360
00:19:48,441 --> 00:19:50,660
way I call a fight on Saturday.

361
00:19:50,780 --> 00:19:55,180
There's fucking queer and he's
fucking fake Jujitsu. Those,

362
00:19:55,390 --> 00:20:00,390
it's just like opening up the devil's
asshole and looking for advice get and

363
00:20:01,610 --> 00:20:06,080
this, but that's part of the fun part of
the fun of being a sports fan is getting

364
00:20:06,081 --> 00:20:08,960
pissed off at shit and it's like,
it's an American outlet,

365
00:20:08,990 --> 00:20:12,230
a uniquely American outlet.
Like American sports radio.

366
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:15,020
I've done a bunch of radio
shows with sports radio guys.

367
00:20:15,230 --> 00:20:18,740
They're very unique and that they'll
just start shitting on these players.

368
00:20:18,830 --> 00:20:20,780
Well let's, let's be honest, he's lazy.

369
00:20:20,870 --> 00:20:23,240
The fucking guy never
gets up before practice.

370
00:20:23,330 --> 00:20:26,470
He's not putting in the extra hours.
She doesn't want it and like, oh,

371
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:28,760
I got to agree with you. He's
got no heart. He's got no art.

372
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:32,570
He's a fucking super athlete in the NFL.
What the fuck are you talking about?

373
00:20:32,630 --> 00:20:33,290
Yeah,

374
00:20:33,290 --> 00:20:37,790
but that's the style of like shitting
on them and they get these free shots

375
00:20:37,791 --> 00:20:42,730
because I mean this guy is a ray rice
or a super athlete type dude. I mean,

376
00:20:42,770 --> 00:20:45,470
not ray rice, because his, his
thing wasn't about sport itself.

377
00:20:45,471 --> 00:20:47,980
It was about violence. But like, you

378
00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:52,780
know, pick one, you know,
pick any superstar who's a
superstar football player,

379
00:20:52,781 --> 00:20:56,590
like awesome. Running back,
uh, currently demarco Murray,

380
00:20:56,800 --> 00:21:00,520
demarco Murray. It's like that
guy that's, you know, come on.

381
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:05,080
Dealing with stud athletes.
Very rare people. Yeah.

382
00:21:06,310 --> 00:21:09,670
I think the issue with the head traumas
60, he's gonna do it no matter what.

383
00:21:09,790 --> 00:21:11,950
They're just going to do it
well, that's on them. Like I,

384
00:21:11,980 --> 00:21:13,810
I believe in individual liberty.

385
00:21:13,811 --> 00:21:16,090
If you want to do something
that's going to harm yourself,

386
00:21:16,120 --> 00:21:18,670
then you should have the
freedom to do it right.

387
00:21:18,671 --> 00:21:22,120
But I want to make sure that there's as
much information and education out there

388
00:21:22,121 --> 00:21:25,290
as possible. So you make an educated
decision. That's true. Yeah.

389
00:21:25,330 --> 00:21:28,840
I think that's true. Or that's
a, that's a very valid, and the,

390
00:21:28,841 --> 00:21:31,990
the idea that they knew about the
damage beforehand, they withheld it.

391
00:21:33,310 --> 00:21:36,280
That's not cool. That means you're working
with people who don't really like you.

392
00:21:36,360 --> 00:21:40,910
Well, the NFL agreed to a settlement.
I don't remember the exact, uh,

393
00:21:41,030 --> 00:21:45,460
number. It was 200 million, a little more
than $200 million. I remembered that.

394
00:21:45,461 --> 00:21:47,290
But I don't remember the exact figure.
Anyway,

395
00:21:47,530 --> 00:21:52,530
part of their settlement was that they
wouldn't have to release the studies or

396
00:21:53,771 --> 00:21:57,100
the findings about the
concussions and the head trauma.

397
00:21:57,550 --> 00:21:59,320
And I thought that that was so shady.

398
00:21:59,321 --> 00:22:03,280
Now that was the original
settlement agreement and I
believe a judge struck that

399
00:22:03,281 --> 00:22:08,120
down. So, um, we'll see what
the outcome of it is. But yes,

400
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:11,470
we reported on that over a year
ago and it was wrong. I mean,

401
00:22:11,471 --> 00:22:12,820
when I read about that,
I was like,

402
00:22:12,821 --> 00:22:15,100
how freaking shady are
you guys think about it?

403
00:22:15,101 --> 00:22:18,010
They make so much money out
of these athletes. And true,

404
00:22:18,011 --> 00:22:21,940
the athletes make millions of dollars
in a lot of cases as well. But I mean,

405
00:22:21,970 --> 00:22:26,970
it's so disproportionate when you think
about the health consequences of what

406
00:22:27,161 --> 00:22:31,060
they're playing. Um, I don't know.
I just, I worry about all that.

407
00:22:31,061 --> 00:22:35,630
But there's a good, you're, you're making
a good argument. You know, it's also the,

408
00:22:35,631 --> 00:22:39,070
the other point that you have that's
very good is that these guys are making

409
00:22:39,071 --> 00:22:42,040
millions of dollars and they wouldn't
necessarily be making that kind of money

410
00:22:42,041 --> 00:22:46,870
doing other things. No, and
they're uniquely built for sports.

411
00:22:47,050 --> 00:22:48,130
I mean these people,

412
00:22:48,131 --> 00:22:53,131
like if you were just around a guy who
was the size of an NFL lineman and he

413
00:22:53,201 --> 00:22:55,390
just worked in your office,
she'd be like, Jesus,

414
00:22:55,690 --> 00:22:59,170
the fuck you do like walk into
him in the kitchen, you know,

415
00:22:59,171 --> 00:23:00,940
you're on your way to the coffee machine.
You're like,

416
00:23:00,941 --> 00:23:02,980
what the fuck is this guy doing here?

417
00:23:03,100 --> 00:23:07,720
There's huge people like Matt Mitre.
Aon is a fighter in the UFC. He was a,

418
00:23:07,721 --> 00:23:10,390
he was a Lineman,
I believe he was a lineman in the NFL.

419
00:23:10,390 --> 00:23:13,330
I know he played in the NFL. Look
that up. See if there's a alignment.

420
00:23:13,550 --> 00:23:17,050
Every time I interview him he says,
fucking giant human.

421
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:21,580
Like if this guy was just hanging out at
a bar and he was angry, you would be, ah,

422
00:23:21,581 --> 00:23:24,790
shit. The giants angry. You know,

423
00:23:24,791 --> 00:23:28,010
you want that guy worn out from
football practice. Okay, fair.

424
00:23:28,110 --> 00:23:31,690
Want him running up hills and
bash into other giant dudes.

425
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:36,220
Like if you don't have that outlet for
a dude, like that is terrifying. I mean,

426
00:23:36,850 --> 00:23:41,320
I'm sure that there could be precautions
taken to lessen the number of people

427
00:23:41,321 --> 00:23:46,250
who suffer from co concussions. I don't
know how, I don't know how interesting.

428
00:23:46,250 --> 00:23:48,110
Because with a game like rugby,

429
00:23:48,170 --> 00:23:52,010
the rate of concussions is actually much
lower than regular football players.

430
00:23:52,011 --> 00:23:56,000
Right. And it's because they don't have
the same type of protection that football

431
00:23:56,001 --> 00:24:00,890
players have. So there are a lot more
careful with what they do. Um, yeah.

432
00:24:01,090 --> 00:24:04,720
Yeah. Um, that's actually an
issue with MMA as well. Uh,

433
00:24:04,721 --> 00:24:08,510
I've been actually saying over the last
couple of months and I've had a bunch of

434
00:24:08,511 --> 00:24:09,890
guys agree with me that are fighters,

435
00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:14,210
that thing we shouldn't have
gloves and the gloves, uh,

436
00:24:14,420 --> 00:24:17,300
what they're really doing is sometimes
they actually, there's a lot of,

437
00:24:17,301 --> 00:24:21,080
I poke problems in the UFC and a lot of
these guys are saying that the gloves

438
00:24:21,081 --> 00:24:23,060
actually are pulling your fingers apart.

439
00:24:23,061 --> 00:24:25,040
So as your hands get
tired and you're fighting,

440
00:24:25,190 --> 00:24:27,560
sometimes the gloves are
difficult to keep close.

441
00:24:27,561 --> 00:24:29,990
It actually requires
resistance to close them.

442
00:24:29,991 --> 00:24:32,000
So there's accidental I
pokes that are happening.

443
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:37,070
They think that with bare knuckles
also you'd be more judicious with your

444
00:24:37,071 --> 00:24:39,140
punches because it's really
easy to break your hand.

445
00:24:39,610 --> 00:24:42,200
Like especially if you hit someone in
the head like in their forehead with the

446
00:24:42,201 --> 00:24:44,540
back of two knuckles,
these were really weak.

447
00:24:44,660 --> 00:24:47,520
They're not really supportive that well
I can karate that kind of teach you to

448
00:24:47,521 --> 00:24:50,150
use the front two muscles,
front two knuckles rather.

449
00:24:50,870 --> 00:24:52,760
But if your bare handed you,

450
00:24:52,761 --> 00:24:56,930
you have a really high
likelihood of hurting your
hands and you also your wrists,

451
00:24:56,931 --> 00:24:59,950
I don't think you're rich should be
taped up cause people get to tape their

452
00:24:59,951 --> 00:25:00,470
wrist,

453
00:25:00,470 --> 00:25:03,800
they table up tight and that what your
risk doesn't move when you punch people

454
00:25:03,801 --> 00:25:08,150
to Lazio Punch him way harder because
like you having your hands wrapped and

455
00:25:08,151 --> 00:25:08,691
everything like that,

456
00:25:08,691 --> 00:25:12,760
that's an unnatural state for your hands
and it turns them into weapons because

457
00:25:12,780 --> 00:25:17,050
ordinarily they're kind of vulnerable
and if you break them, it's huge.

458
00:25:17,150 --> 00:25:18,440
A guy breaks his hand in a fight,

459
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:21,560
has huge problems is now you can't
punch with this hand effectively.

460
00:25:21,680 --> 00:25:24,200
You only have one hand. And if
you, even if you have to grapple,

461
00:25:24,350 --> 00:25:26,660
like you probably are not going
to able to squeeze hard with it,

462
00:25:26,930 --> 00:25:28,030
so you're fucked.
Oh,

463
00:25:28,040 --> 00:25:32,660
what the hell it got you into UFC fighting
like just an excess of testosterone.

464
00:25:32,661 --> 00:25:36,890
You want to beat the shit out of
people. Like, Ooh, no, no, no. Honestly,

465
00:25:37,070 --> 00:25:41,960
I got into martial arts when I was a
kid because I was very insecure and very

466
00:25:41,961 --> 00:25:45,650
lost and I needed
something to like put me,

467
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:51,440
put me in a challenging environment
where I could put like some physical

468
00:25:53,271 --> 00:25:57,380
intensity into something that was very
competitive and very dangerous and scary

469
00:25:57,381 --> 00:25:58,070
to me.

470
00:25:58,070 --> 00:26:02,390
So it became what the way my instructor
used to describe it is that it's a

471
00:26:02,391 --> 00:26:06,050
vehicle for her human potential
developing human potential.

472
00:26:06,380 --> 00:26:09,500
And that when you're doing
with martial arts is not,

473
00:26:09,501 --> 00:26:12,050
you're not trying to kick people's asses,
you kind of are,

474
00:26:12,260 --> 00:26:15,620
but what you were really trying to do
is you're trying to do something that's

475
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:19,190
unbelievably difficult and scary.
And in doing so,

476
00:26:19,191 --> 00:26:24,140
you develop your character in a very
profound way that a lot of people don't.

477
00:26:24,170 --> 00:26:29,170
They don't experience the terror of
someone trying to kick your head off.

478
00:26:30,381 --> 00:26:35,381
Like literally you feel the whoosh of
heels going by your head that would have

479
00:26:35,601 --> 00:26:38,840
separated you from your
consciousness with with no doubt,

480
00:26:38,930 --> 00:26:42,560
and you see it happening left and right
around you see guys getting acts kicked

481
00:26:42,561 --> 00:26:44,340
in, the head, kicked in the head,

482
00:26:44,550 --> 00:26:48,360
turning side kick to the body and they
crumble like they got hit by a car.

483
00:26:48,570 --> 00:26:51,720
I've just seen that so many times.
It's how fine.

484
00:26:51,750 --> 00:26:55,320
I can't imagine what the adrenaline
is like right before a fight.

485
00:26:55,380 --> 00:26:56,550
It's very hard to manage.

486
00:26:56,730 --> 00:26:59,910
Some people have the biggest issues with
managing the adrenaline and you see it

487
00:26:59,911 --> 00:27:03,030
in the UFC all the time with guys
who were having their first fight.

488
00:27:03,031 --> 00:27:07,500
We've caught octagon shock because it's
so intense like all these lights are on

489
00:27:07,501 --> 00:27:09,540
and the camera's on. You like, Holy Shit,

490
00:27:09,541 --> 00:27:12,960
I'm in the fucking UFC because they've
been fighting and all these smaller

491
00:27:12,961 --> 00:27:14,310
organizations.
Right?

492
00:27:14,460 --> 00:27:17,940
Very few people have seen it and they've
developed this record and they've got

493
00:27:17,941 --> 00:27:22,050
some good skills and then all of a sudden
this just wave of adrenaline hits them

494
00:27:22,051 --> 00:27:25,950
and they're like, Holy Shit. Their
heart's going like you could see it.

495
00:27:26,220 --> 00:27:28,980
The breathing heavy.
They're trying to calm themselves down.

496
00:27:29,010 --> 00:27:29,843
It's very hard to manage.

497
00:27:29,850 --> 00:27:30,960
No,
I can't imagine it.

498
00:27:30,961 --> 00:27:35,940
So one thing that I've always been really
terrified about is I'm skydiving and I

499
00:27:35,941 --> 00:27:38,820
know, I know fuck all that. So Christian,

500
00:27:38,821 --> 00:27:42,970
I have been talking about
doing it together. One

501
00:27:43,140 --> 00:27:45,780
one one day, one the next day.
The other way, if one of you dies,

502
00:27:45,781 --> 00:27:47,940
you can miss the other.
If you both die together,

503
00:27:47,941 --> 00:27:50,180
it'd be so we'd feel like we're fucking,
it is.

504
00:27:50,450 --> 00:27:53,740
I know, I know. I love
you. I love you too.

505
00:27:54,760 --> 00:27:58,940
It's over.
I feel like I'd almost prefer that if I,

506
00:27:58,941 --> 00:28:01,730
if I had an option between,
that's the romantic,

507
00:28:02,120 --> 00:28:05,430
I guess you guys are really in love.
It's unbearable.

508
00:28:05,630 --> 00:28:10,010
It's from Romeo and Juliet type shit.
One of the things.

509
00:28:10,011 --> 00:28:14,270
One of the things that scares me about
skydiving isn't even the act of me like

510
00:28:14,450 --> 00:28:18,260
already outside of the plane and
seeing the ground come toward me.

511
00:28:18,530 --> 00:28:20,630
I'm more afraid of the
feeling that you get,

512
00:28:20,631 --> 00:28:23,480
the adrenaline rush that you get
before you jump out of the plane.

513
00:28:23,690 --> 00:28:27,110
I don't like a drone adrenaline. That's a
shitty feeling. Okay? I don't understand.

514
00:28:27,111 --> 00:28:29,940
People that are adrenaline junkies,
you're talking to them just

515
00:28:29,940 --> 00:28:34,890
picturing feet on the edges, looking
down, holding onto the side called,

516
00:28:34,891 --> 00:28:39,400
fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck,
fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck. I just,

517
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:41,700
I can't, I mean, we're
going to end up doing it,

518
00:28:41,701 --> 00:28:45,780
but I know I'm going to be miserable.
Who was it that was on the podcast?

519
00:28:46,110 --> 00:28:47,130
Was it someone on the podcast?

520
00:28:47,131 --> 00:28:50,850
It told the story about the first
time they went skydiving there.

521
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:54,060
First parachute didn't work. They
had to cut it off. Oh my God.

522
00:28:54,300 --> 00:28:56,820
Was that someone in the podcast?
Was it someone someone was talking to me?

523
00:28:57,600 --> 00:29:00,000
Might've been Steve Graham. God
didn't. No, it wasn't Steve.

524
00:29:00,740 --> 00:29:02,490
I've got to remember who
the fuck told me this story.

525
00:29:02,491 --> 00:29:06,090
But they went skydiving and they're
fucking parachute didn't work. They had,

526
00:29:06,210 --> 00:29:08,250
the guy had him, he put, he goes,
we got an issue here. He goes,

527
00:29:08,251 --> 00:29:09,480
what would that mean? He goes, well,

528
00:29:09,481 --> 00:29:12,390
I'm going to have to cut this parachute
loose and we're going to go with the

529
00:29:12,391 --> 00:29:16,920
backup. And like what? He's like,
what? So he's on the, you know,

530
00:29:16,950 --> 00:29:19,280
this guy's on his back, you know,
this is how, you know, you know,

531
00:29:19,350 --> 00:29:23,250
they do that like they're about to choke
you and that's how you fly through the

532
00:29:23,251 --> 00:29:24,870
air.
I just wouldn't want to know.

533
00:29:24,930 --> 00:29:29,910
And he's fucking song off the other
one so it doesn't get tangled up in the

534
00:29:29,911 --> 00:29:33,630
second one when he pulls the backup. And
if that doesn't work, you're a Foxville.

535
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:38,340
No, no. We're not doing it. Doing,
I don't want to talk you out of it.

536
00:29:39,990 --> 00:29:43,120
But my, uh, my friend Brian,
Brian Redman, you've met him.

537
00:29:43,390 --> 00:29:47,230
His Dad was working with this person.
I forget it was a man or a woman.

538
00:29:47,231 --> 00:29:50,930
Was it a woman? He's told the
store. I think it was a man. Um,

539
00:29:51,050 --> 00:29:53,200
working might've been woman.
Anyway,

540
00:29:53,310 --> 00:29:56,270
we're working with this person and
they were always trying to get them to

541
00:29:56,280 --> 00:30:01,150
skydive. Like, come on, you've got to come
with us. It's awesome. It's such a rush.

542
00:30:01,390 --> 00:30:03,640
Oh yeah. Yeah. Okay. Just so I
get to find the time, you know,

543
00:30:03,641 --> 00:30:06,760
I'm with my kid on the weekends and then
one day he shows up at work at Monday

544
00:30:06,761 --> 00:30:11,700
and he's like, where's this person?
They died skydiving. Oh my God. Really?

545
00:30:12,060 --> 00:30:13,620
Oh Shit.

546
00:30:16,110 --> 00:30:17,290
That's you hitting a lawn.

547
00:30:21,900 --> 00:30:26,900
It's your body in the lawn
coming from 10,000 feet.

548
00:30:27,460 --> 00:30:31,510
Just kidding towards earth
being sucked into the gravity.

549
00:30:32,340 --> 00:30:35,220
I feel like when I feel like my
life's pretty exciting. Yeah.

550
00:30:35,260 --> 00:30:38,610
I have an exciting life. I don't need to
jump out of a plane to feel like it's,

551
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:41,790
and by the way, as I was
looking up, um, you know,

552
00:30:41,791 --> 00:30:43,710
skydiving tickets and
all that other stuff,

553
00:30:43,711 --> 00:30:48,711
I did look up the number of people that
die per year due to skydiving accidents

554
00:30:48,961 --> 00:30:53,090
just to, and it's actually not as
rare as I thought it would be. Okay.

555
00:30:53,820 --> 00:30:58,710
Like I thought it would be like one person
has died over the last 10 years and I

556
00:30:58,770 --> 00:31:02,340
know there, there are a lot of accidents
that happen. How many was it a year?

557
00:31:02,700 --> 00:31:06,870
I don't remember. But it was enough.
Let's guess sky diving. It was like,

558
00:31:07,170 --> 00:31:11,970
I think it was like 11 out of a
thousand or something like that. Maybe.

559
00:31:11,971 --> 00:31:13,980
I don't remember the
number, but it was, it was,

560
00:31:14,010 --> 00:31:16,250
that alone is enough to
make me uncommercial.

561
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:17,840
I don't know what that means though,
as far as,

562
00:31:17,841 --> 00:31:19,340
I don't know how many
people are skydiving.

563
00:31:19,341 --> 00:31:22,490
So if it's 1100 thousand how many yeah,
many people do you think die every year?

564
00:31:22,491 --> 00:31:25,970
If you had to guess,
I'm going to go with like 25.

565
00:31:27,050 --> 00:31:27,883
Hmm.

566
00:31:28,230 --> 00:31:31,890
Okay. Hold on. Don't pull
it up yet cause I got a yes.

567
00:31:33,320 --> 00:31:33,580
Yeah.

568
00:31:33,580 --> 00:31:36,310
Hmm. Let's see. Um,

569
00:31:38,380 --> 00:31:43,000
I'm going to guess 50 50. Wow. That's a
high number out of how many do you say?

570
00:31:43,390 --> 00:31:48,340
I Dunno, per year. Oh, all right. I got
the number here. 42.5 fatalities per year.

571
00:31:48,700 --> 00:31:51,070
42 fuck that.

572
00:31:51,610 --> 00:31:56,470
It says the 1970s. Hold on. It says,
uh, in the 1980s, the average was 34.

573
00:31:56,710 --> 00:32:01,300
Okay. What do you got? I
got a 21 out of 3 million.

574
00:32:03,590 --> 00:32:07,070
Hmm. In 2010, 2013 is the last
year they have it and they have,

575
00:32:07,071 --> 00:32:11,930
it's 24 24 all right.
As a 25 so that's still too much for me.

576
00:32:12,140 --> 00:32:17,060
Yeah, it's out of 3.2 million jumpers.
But if you look at this calendar,

577
00:32:17,061 --> 00:32:21,590
this is pretty crazy because if you
look at this, the schedule, what,

578
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:26,300
what's the data? What's really crazy
is they're showing you the numbers.

579
00:32:26,330 --> 00:32:31,330
You get 2013 and then you get 24 and then
you get estimated animal annual jumps,

580
00:32:31,940 --> 00:32:35,360
3.2 million. Okay. Fatalities
per jump, very low.

581
00:32:35,630 --> 00:32:40,490
But when you look at it on paper,
imagine you were living

582
00:32:40,520 --> 00:32:45,470
in one town where this many people
fell from the sky every year,

583
00:32:45,620 --> 00:32:46,453
okay?
If all

584
00:32:46,490 --> 00:32:51,380
skydiving was only in Kenosha, Wisconsin,
and you're working on a farm in Kenosha,

585
00:32:51,560 --> 00:32:52,820
and you just,
every day you're here,

586
00:32:55,220 --> 00:32:58,310
there's 32 and a fucking year,
that's more than one a month.

587
00:32:58,460 --> 00:32:59,720
More than once a month.

588
00:32:59,750 --> 00:33:04,750
Someone falls from the fucking sky and
die screaming as they slam into a planet.

589
00:33:10,190 --> 00:33:15,190
2000 30202000130 five 35 bodies
in a year falling from the sky.

590
00:33:17,630 --> 00:33:20,750
If it was in one neighborhood,
it would fucking sock.

591
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:23,630
It would literally be
raining people every day.

592
00:33:23,631 --> 00:33:27,080
You would go outside terrified that
you're going to fucking get in your car.

593
00:33:27,170 --> 00:33:28,003
Startup,

594
00:33:28,250 --> 00:33:32,990
good doge and a guy comes from the sky
and slammed in the euro hoods, Joe,

595
00:33:32,991 --> 00:33:35,840
but you've already convinced
me to not go sky diving.

596
00:33:36,380 --> 00:33:38,810
You don't need to do any more.
I'm not trying to convince you,

597
00:33:38,870 --> 00:33:42,860
I'm not trying to convince you, but I'm
just imagining that I'm living in a town.

598
00:33:43,550 --> 00:33:47,300
You know, just let's say Chicago. It's
a city. It's a host city. Big City.

599
00:33:47,390 --> 00:33:52,220
35 people fall from the fucking sky
on a Chicago a year. You'd be like,

600
00:33:52,221 --> 00:33:55,690
what the fuck are you guys
doing? And look, the craziest

601
00:33:55,770 --> 00:33:59,460
part about it is it wasn't
something necessary, right?

602
00:33:59,490 --> 00:34:02,280
It was something that you
paid for and it's expensive.

603
00:34:02,281 --> 00:34:04,530
It's like hundreds of
dollars to go skydiving.

604
00:34:04,740 --> 00:34:06,870
So you just paid hundreds
of thousands of dollars,

605
00:34:07,060 --> 00:34:09,900
hundreds of thousands or
hundreds of dollars to die.

606
00:34:10,430 --> 00:34:14,930
Yeah. Well, yeah. Essentially with
someone attached to your back,

607
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:17,210
but it's gotta be a rush. Otherwise
they wouldn't be doing it. Yeah.

608
00:34:17,300 --> 00:34:18,260
I don't need that rush.

609
00:34:18,830 --> 00:34:23,210
You know that that story was from Ryan
Parsons and they had video. That's right.

610
00:34:23,270 --> 00:34:28,100
That's right. It was Ryan video
of it. Oh God, that's right.

611
00:34:28,130 --> 00:34:32,600
No, we're not watching that.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no. I
don't mean to watch that. Yeah.

612
00:34:33,050 --> 00:34:36,350
I don't even like hiking next to
a cliff because I'm like worried.

613
00:34:36,351 --> 00:34:40,070
I might like step the wrong way and
somehow roll down the cliff and die.

614
00:34:40,130 --> 00:34:43,850
You have to worry about shit dropping on
you too. Yeah. This room's things fall.

615
00:34:43,880 --> 00:34:44,713
You know,

616
00:34:44,870 --> 00:34:48,590
you always drive by when you're driving
down roads and there's lows falling rock

617
00:34:48,591 --> 00:34:52,280
signs, you see rocks on the road. Yeah.
Like if you're below one of those rocks,

618
00:34:52,281 --> 00:34:56,570
they hit you in the fucking head and your
dad's Ville or your windshield. Yeah.

619
00:34:57,380 --> 00:34:58,260
It's scary.
Okay.

620
00:34:58,310 --> 00:35:01,960
There.
But this is a certain amount of fun

621
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:06,270
in being in those weird environments
that are kind of dangerous,

622
00:35:06,271 --> 00:35:09,150
like as long as you recognize it. It's
where like hiking, it's when you do the,

623
00:35:09,160 --> 00:35:11,520
you're careful and you
know what you're doing.

624
00:35:11,550 --> 00:35:14,760
There's like a certain weird thrill to it.
When I was in Alaska,

625
00:35:14,761 --> 00:35:18,540
we were this island called
Prince of Wales and uh,

626
00:35:18,570 --> 00:35:21,780
there was a deer that was below us and
we were like sitting on the edge of this

627
00:35:21,781 --> 00:35:24,450
rock and it was literally a fucking cliff.

628
00:35:24,660 --> 00:35:26,640
So there's the edge of this cliff
and I'm looked down, I'm like, yeah,

629
00:35:26,680 --> 00:35:29,770
whole fucker.
My whole body like Titan.

630
00:35:30,050 --> 00:35:31,970
He's like, you don't want to go
near that cliff, do you? I go, no,

631
00:35:31,971 --> 00:35:33,620
I don't want to go.
I don't want to go near that cliff.

632
00:35:33,870 --> 00:35:36,200
Like I'm not going to sit like she's
sitting there with his legs dangled over

633
00:35:36,201 --> 00:35:38,280
the edge. I'm like, that shit.

634
00:35:38,730 --> 00:35:40,360
Fuck that shit for.
Not any like,

635
00:35:40,370 --> 00:35:44,040
dad's not interested in sitting with his
legs dangling over a cliff and there's

636
00:35:44,041 --> 00:35:46,680
like a fucking thousand
foot drop underneath them
or whatever the hell it is.

637
00:35:46,770 --> 00:35:51,030
500 foot drop at least
you're dead or you're like,

638
00:35:51,830 --> 00:35:53,670
no, no interest in that.
No interest in that.

639
00:35:53,720 --> 00:35:57,480
That fucking thing that it does to
your body when you see someone do that,

640
00:35:57,481 --> 00:36:00,270
when you look, look over a ledge and
you see that view and you're like,

641
00:36:00,330 --> 00:36:04,170
oh the dude, some people get
off on that, like not sexually,

642
00:36:04,171 --> 00:36:08,030
but like they get a rush that
they're addicted to and I don't,

643
00:36:08,250 --> 00:36:12,360
I don't know what it is about people
who, who love that, but I don't,

644
00:36:12,390 --> 00:36:16,890
I really don't. Maybe I'm a boring person,
but I like being comfortable. Well,

645
00:36:17,910 --> 00:36:22,040
it's a, it's a weird thing to love,
to love, to be scared. You know,

646
00:36:22,050 --> 00:36:23,970
you don't want to die. You don't want
to get hurt, but you want to be scared.

647
00:36:24,210 --> 00:36:27,150
It's a weird thing, but it's really
common. I mean, look at roller coasters.

648
00:36:27,630 --> 00:36:31,980
The scariest fuck most fucked up things
you could do in your life these days or

649
00:36:31,981 --> 00:36:35,370
go to some of those like magic mountain
rollercoasters yeah. Holy Shit.

650
00:36:35,371 --> 00:36:39,150
Those are terrifying. Yeah, it was at
one, they have the x something or another.

651
00:36:39,330 --> 00:36:42,960
They have a one called the viper
and one called the x. The X one.

652
00:36:43,110 --> 00:36:44,790
You can't even have
anything in your pockets.

653
00:36:44,910 --> 00:36:49,910
They strap you to this concoction spins
you around all this fucking chaos.

654
00:36:50,461 --> 00:36:54,930
And it is so terrifying because
you're like, if this thing goes wrong,

655
00:36:54,931 --> 00:36:58,720
MYP shit, it's just breaking apart.
You're just going to put bodies,

656
00:36:58,740 --> 00:37:00,330
you can get ripped to shreds.

657
00:37:00,331 --> 00:37:05,280
You're going to get smashed into the
gears of this machine is so powerful that

658
00:37:05,281 --> 00:37:10,260
it's whipping 200 people
simultaneously around, you know,

659
00:37:10,440 --> 00:37:13,380
surprisingly roller coasters
don't scare me at all.

660
00:37:13,470 --> 00:37:16,890
Not even a little bit like I don't
mind roller coasters. I just,

661
00:37:17,460 --> 00:37:21,180
anything where I am, there's like a
free fall involved, I'll get scared. Um,

662
00:37:21,210 --> 00:37:24,930
but other than that, I feel like I can
handle it. Roller coasters are great.

663
00:37:25,050 --> 00:37:26,280
I love roller coasters,

664
00:37:26,550 --> 00:37:30,990
but there's always that somewhere in your
mind has to recognize that people have

665
00:37:30,991 --> 00:37:35,640
died on his fucking pants. It's not
very many. It's very few. Yep. Very,

666
00:37:35,641 --> 00:37:38,910
very few. Most likely you're going to be
fine, but you might not be. I mean, look,

667
00:37:38,911 --> 00:37:41,670
you put your life in danger every time
you get behind the wheel and you drive.

668
00:37:42,270 --> 00:37:46,470
I'm averaging an accident a year at
this point. Is this that thing, Jamie,

669
00:37:46,680 --> 00:37:50,530
what is it called? Magic
Mountain. Oh, good Lord. Justin,

670
00:37:50,550 --> 00:37:53,490
when I did this fucking thing.
Oh God.

671
00:37:53,850 --> 00:37:57,750
They give you all a locker.
Okay. This ride so fucked up.

672
00:37:57,750 --> 00:37:59,070
You get all locker.

673
00:37:59,650 --> 00:38:03,900
You get to put your shit in a locker so
you don't have anything in your pockets

674
00:38:03,930 --> 00:38:06,690
because anything that's in there, it's
just going to fly into someone's eyeball.

675
00:38:07,610 --> 00:38:12,120
The top thrilled dragster at Cedar Point
I've been on you go to 120 miles an

676
00:38:12,121 --> 00:38:16,560
hour, I think in like three seconds
and up to 420 feet within six.

677
00:38:16,820 --> 00:38:20,730
Fuck the fuck are you saying? And then
straight down kind of look at this.

678
00:38:20,731 --> 00:38:24,450
It's a roller coaster where you're
hanging upside down and spinning around in

679
00:38:24,451 --> 00:38:26,910
circles.
Oh good Lord.

680
00:38:27,930 --> 00:38:31,620
You're just experiencing it from
watching it from an outside perspective.

681
00:38:31,621 --> 00:38:33,840
If you're sitting in those seats,
it's madness.

682
00:38:33,841 --> 00:38:36,130
You're fucking up feel when it was over,

683
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:39,010
like usually when the
rollercoaster is done, I'm like,

684
00:38:39,011 --> 00:38:40,720
my entire body's kind of trembling,

685
00:38:41,050 --> 00:38:43,680
but when you're in the moment
you don't feel it like it.

686
00:38:43,960 --> 00:38:45,580
And I don't mind that feeling.

687
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:50,620
The thing that I don't like is just the
anticipation of something that scares

688
00:38:50,621 --> 00:38:53,140
me. So like again,
jumping out of that plane,

689
00:38:53,500 --> 00:38:57,740
like the moment before I jump out of the
plane is what scares me the most. Um,

690
00:38:58,150 --> 00:39:01,030
but yeah, when I'm in the middle of
it, I feel like I can handle it fine.

691
00:39:01,170 --> 00:39:03,600
I think a lot of fighters
get addicted to that,

692
00:39:03,601 --> 00:39:08,310
overcoming that moment and being calm
and peaceful in that moment, you know?

693
00:39:08,311 --> 00:39:12,810
Because especially like what I did doing
taekwondo is not nearly as terrifying

694
00:39:12,840 --> 00:39:15,820
is doing MMA because MMA is just,
it's just a,

695
00:39:16,710 --> 00:39:20,460
it's more likely that someone's going
to have an answer to your bullshit.

696
00:39:20,910 --> 00:39:22,980
And then it is if you're
just doing one discipline,

697
00:39:22,981 --> 00:39:25,380
whether it's boxing or something
like that, just so many variables,

698
00:39:25,410 --> 00:39:30,030
it's really easy to get smashed and it's,
it's hard to beat everybody in MMA.

699
00:39:30,180 --> 00:39:33,590
It's one of the more difficult sports
to become like truly dominant in. Yep.

700
00:39:33,630 --> 00:39:35,610
And so when these guys are
getting into that cage,

701
00:39:35,611 --> 00:39:40,611
like you could see this wrestling match
with this anticipation with all this

702
00:39:41,011 --> 00:39:44,970
nervous energy and it's a huge part
of it for them because when they win,

703
00:39:45,270 --> 00:39:47,430
you never seen anybody
happier. Yeah. When,

704
00:39:47,450 --> 00:39:51,210
when a guy has like a huge victory the
UFC and they throw their arms up and they

705
00:39:51,211 --> 00:39:55,620
fuck like there's this, there's
craziness to it. It's just,

706
00:39:56,140 --> 00:40:01,020
you don't, you can't imagine someone
being like more excited to win something,

707
00:40:01,350 --> 00:40:05,520
you know, like you don't ever like
win a game of ping pong and go like,

708
00:40:05,580 --> 00:40:06,550
they jump up there,

709
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:10,230
they're just so pumped up that
they literally can't control it.

710
00:40:10,320 --> 00:40:13,920
That's how I feel at the end of the day
when I haven't read a comment asking me

711
00:40:13,921 --> 00:40:18,830
to sit on someone's face like,
fuck no, I get that kind of,

712
00:40:18,860 --> 00:40:20,520
I get that kind of Shit on daily basis.

713
00:40:20,521 --> 00:40:25,140
So if I go like one day without reading
like a crazy ass comment, I'm like,

714
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:26,290
oh by God it's okay.

715
00:40:26,380 --> 00:40:27,213
Good day.

716
00:40:28,100 --> 00:40:29,600
Problem is they probably
get you condition.

717
00:40:29,610 --> 00:40:32,540
So if you want a few months without any
of those comments, he'd be like, Hey,

718
00:40:32,570 --> 00:40:33,150
come on.

719
00:40:33,150 --> 00:40:36,090
Well, every now and it was finished
it on their face. What the fuck?

720
00:40:36,320 --> 00:40:39,320
Come on every now and again to my boys,

721
00:40:39,820 --> 00:40:44,480
I'm not saying cut it out entirely.
How rude. Imagine if that was okay.

722
00:40:44,530 --> 00:40:47,260
Okay. So you just, you know,
once you missed it you like shit.

723
00:40:47,340 --> 00:40:50,580
No, but you know, the one
thing that I did realize is,

724
00:40:51,030 --> 00:40:54,780
I mean in the very beginning of
my career, I guess, um, when I,

725
00:40:54,810 --> 00:40:58,110
when people wouldn't focus on what I was
talking about and then all the comments

726
00:40:58,111 --> 00:41:00,240
were about what I look
like, I was like, Ugh, God,

727
00:41:00,570 --> 00:41:02,340
no one's paying attention
to what I'm saying. Then.

728
00:41:02,380 --> 00:41:05,820
And I was like kind of heard about it
and then I realize like these people are

729
00:41:05,821 --> 00:41:08,490
telling me I'm attractive.
There are worse things in the world.

730
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:13,370
Yeah. With my life. You got a super
lucky roll. The dice. Yeah. Medically.

731
00:41:13,730 --> 00:41:15,830
Thank you. That's very sweet. Yeah. Right.

732
00:41:15,831 --> 00:41:19,620
So like if they're saying that you're hot,
that's fine. Let it, yeah. Yeah. I don't,

733
00:41:19,621 --> 00:41:22,060
so I don't mind those comments anymore.
But it is,

734
00:41:22,070 --> 00:41:25,010
it's a weird thing that men
do to dismiss women, right?

735
00:41:25,040 --> 00:41:28,550
They'll talk about your looks or your
makeup or something like your heels,

736
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:31,850
you know, that's, that's cheap.
That's like a cheap tactic.

737
00:41:31,880 --> 00:41:33,020
Like if someone's talking about an,

738
00:41:33,730 --> 00:41:36,980
and you start talking shit about
their makeup, you know, like, oh,

739
00:41:36,981 --> 00:41:41,960
like girls in heels and look at her with
a little skirt. Yeah. But then again,

740
00:41:42,140 --> 00:41:45,290
for the male's point of view, it's
very weird that you get to wear skirts.

741
00:41:45,840 --> 00:41:48,450
Really. Do you want to wear a
skirt? I mean, I wouldn't judge. You

742
00:41:49,120 --> 00:41:51,190
don't want to wear a skirt.
However,

743
00:41:51,280 --> 00:41:56,280
it's very weird that one gender gets to
regularly expose their shaved legs and

744
00:41:57,161 --> 00:42:01,010
flip them back and forth and
interviews. And it's very strange. Yeah,

745
00:42:01,240 --> 00:42:06,240
it's very odd that you have the
one gender that is more desirable,

746
00:42:06,790 --> 00:42:08,050
physically more pursued.

747
00:42:08,051 --> 00:42:11,380
If you had a bet like who's pursuing more
as women or women pursuing men more or

748
00:42:11,381 --> 00:42:15,280
men pursuing women war for sure.
Men are pursuing women more so the,

749
00:42:15,281 --> 00:42:20,281
the women are more pursued
but more exposed in their
attire on a regular basis.

750
00:42:21,400 --> 00:42:26,400
Like just a tiny piece of cloth separating
your vagina from the cold hard world.

751
00:42:27,220 --> 00:42:31,710
And that's standard business clothes.
Yeah, that's kind of odd, right?

752
00:42:31,940 --> 00:42:36,830
I guess. But you know, it's
funny because there's, there are,

753
00:42:37,080 --> 00:42:40,930
there are different schools of feminism,
right? I just said feminism, Europe,

754
00:42:40,950 --> 00:42:45,190
viewers just like lost interest
and started throwing up anyway.

755
00:42:45,210 --> 00:42:47,150
Just stay with me. Stay
with me, please. Okay.

756
00:42:47,151 --> 00:42:50,990
So there's one school that
thinks like if you are a woman,

757
00:42:50,991 --> 00:42:55,490
do not flaunt your sexuality. Do
not embrace femininity, rejected.

758
00:42:55,860 --> 00:43:00,080
Um, because that if you do
flaunt it, that's all people
are going to focus on. And,

759
00:43:00,470 --> 00:43:03,140
but like, I fucking hate that
school of thought, right?

760
00:43:03,141 --> 00:43:05,240
Because I think femininity is great.

761
00:43:05,241 --> 00:43:07,800
And I like embracing the differences
between men and women. Men,

762
00:43:07,830 --> 00:43:08,750
women are not equal.

763
00:43:08,751 --> 00:43:11,090
That doesn't mean that men are better
than women or that women are better than

764
00:43:11,091 --> 00:43:13,730
men. We're freaking
different. Right? Yeah.

765
00:43:13,790 --> 00:43:18,530
And so embrace the fact that you have
differences, but expect or, or yeah,

766
00:43:18,531 --> 00:43:23,030
expect equality when it
comes to situations regarding
employment and things like

767
00:43:23,031 --> 00:43:27,080
that. Right. But yeah, I mean,
I'd love to do like, you know,

768
00:43:27,081 --> 00:43:30,540
sociological, historical, um,

769
00:43:30,830 --> 00:43:34,490
research to figure out why it is that
women can dress that way and men don't,

770
00:43:34,491 --> 00:43:37,480
whatever it is. But also, I dunno,

771
00:43:37,520 --> 00:43:40,760
it's funny because going back to what
you said about men pursuing women more,

772
00:43:41,120 --> 00:43:46,040
I think that that is changing
slowly based on with Tinder.

773
00:43:46,250 --> 00:43:47,120
Sure.
Okay.

774
00:43:47,121 --> 00:43:50,300
So there's that element of his are
out there just banging left and right.

775
00:43:50,301 --> 00:43:52,430
These crazy kids,
there's that element of it.

776
00:43:52,460 --> 00:43:56,870
But I also think that as women become
more dominant in the workforce,

777
00:43:57,260 --> 00:44:00,740
I think you're seeing more and more women
feel confident enough to pursue men.

778
00:44:00,741 --> 00:44:02,660
At least that's my experience.
I

779
00:44:02,660 --> 00:44:06,980
think it's insulting to think that a
woman can't wear whatever the fuck she

780
00:44:06,981 --> 00:44:10,580
wants. Whatever she likes to wear,
the way they dress, the way she wants,

781
00:44:10,581 --> 00:44:12,130
and still be intelligent. Yeah, that's,

782
00:44:12,380 --> 00:44:17,380
that's really like a form of sexism
inside of like your own gender.

783
00:44:17,640 --> 00:44:21,430
It's like you're, you're separating
the idea of like a serious woman. Yup.

784
00:44:21,680 --> 00:44:24,080
You know, a serious woman and
a woman who wants to look sexy.

785
00:44:24,310 --> 00:44:27,920
Well says who says you?
Yeah. So it's who, who's the,

786
00:44:27,921 --> 00:44:29,990
who's the one who gets to
make this call and you know,

787
00:44:29,991 --> 00:44:31,200
here's where it gets really weird.

788
00:44:31,950 --> 00:44:36,210
The one exception to that as far as like
women dressing up and like really like

789
00:44:36,211 --> 00:44:39,930
skimpy outfits and looking really sexy
and wearing high heels and makeup and

790
00:44:39,931 --> 00:44:43,050
really girling up.
The one exception is transgender women.

791
00:44:43,290 --> 00:44:46,950
Transgender women are always supported
as deep as they go into the woman

792
00:44:47,430 --> 00:44:50,790
category. Like as deep as they go
into the femininity care. You go girl,

793
00:44:50,791 --> 00:44:53,820
you go girl. Yeah. Nobody ever says
to like a transgender woman, hey,

794
00:44:53,821 --> 00:44:57,060
you're dressing like a whore. You
know, they give her some slack.

795
00:44:57,230 --> 00:45:00,800
I think that the same courtesy
should be extended to anyone and,

796
00:45:00,801 --> 00:45:05,330
and whatever a woman wants to where I
am supportive of it just because like

797
00:45:05,331 --> 00:45:07,910
someone might wear something that
I wouldn't want to wear myself,

798
00:45:07,911 --> 00:45:10,640
but that doesn't mean that I should sit
around and like judge them and say, Oh,

799
00:45:10,641 --> 00:45:12,470
I'm not going to take
this person seriously.

800
00:45:12,620 --> 00:45:15,440
So I got to give a quick example
because this kind of shows you how

801
00:45:15,441 --> 00:45:18,350
progressive's can go too far
when it comes to certain things.

802
00:45:18,680 --> 00:45:21,660
So I have this friend from Grad School,
um,

803
00:45:21,770 --> 00:45:24,800
who is like a hardcore progressive,
right.

804
00:45:25,190 --> 00:45:30,190
And he was co I commented on or I did
a status update on Facebook when I

805
00:45:30,591 --> 00:45:33,050
recently went to France
for a media conference.

806
00:45:33,860 --> 00:45:38,060
I didn't know that I had to walk around
on the plane or else my legs would get

807
00:45:38,061 --> 00:45:42,290
fucking swollen as I've ever seen them.
Like they got really swollen,

808
00:45:42,291 --> 00:45:45,530
so none of my shoes fit
once I finally landed. Um,

809
00:45:45,590 --> 00:45:49,790
and so I wrote on Facebook that I had
to buy a new pair of shoes that were a

810
00:45:49,791 --> 00:45:52,070
size and a half larger than
what my feet really are,

811
00:45:52,071 --> 00:45:56,030
just so I can wear heels
to this conference. And he
commented back and he's like,

812
00:45:56,210 --> 00:46:00,320
why are you wearing heels and why are you
subscribing to the male expectation of

813
00:46:00,590 --> 00:46:04,430
femininity and beauty and you're doing a
disservice to feminism? And I was like,

814
00:46:04,820 --> 00:46:06,890
really? I was like, you're in towards,

815
00:46:06,891 --> 00:46:11,570
you find it ironic that you as a dude are
now telling me what I should wear as a

816
00:46:11,571 --> 00:46:16,571
woman in order to follow the right
perspective of femininity or feminism,

817
00:46:17,271 --> 00:46:20,750
I should say. So that really made
me, made me upset because for me,

818
00:46:20,751 --> 00:46:24,350
wearing high heels isn't
about attracting men. Sure.

819
00:46:24,351 --> 00:46:26,090
There's some part of it in there.

820
00:46:26,360 --> 00:46:30,110
But what I actually love about wearing
heels is it makes me stand straight.

821
00:46:30,111 --> 00:46:32,690
It makes me feel sexy.
It makes me feel confident.

822
00:46:32,960 --> 00:46:35,990
And I feel like once I put it on a
pair of heels, I can rule the world.

823
00:46:35,991 --> 00:46:38,570
It has very little to do
about attracting males.

824
00:46:39,080 --> 00:46:40,820
Yeah. You should be able to
wear whatever the fuck you want.

825
00:46:40,821 --> 00:46:43,840
If Gene Simmons could wear those boots
with the teeth on the bottom of them and

826
00:46:43,850 --> 00:46:46,190
still be one of the manliest
man ever. I mean, come on.

827
00:46:46,191 --> 00:46:49,460
He said we were boots that went all the
way up to his knees. Nobody complained.

828
00:46:49,490 --> 00:46:54,200
Nobody give us back your man card with
your feminine outwit, but the shoes, boy,

829
00:46:54,201 --> 00:46:57,590
what's up with the fucking
shoes? Disappoint me. No,

830
00:46:57,591 --> 00:47:02,270
you know he doesn't have to go on stage
at timberlands on some fucking Rodeo

831
00:47:02,271 --> 00:47:06,620
belt. Buckle shoes. He's
wearing leather pants.

832
00:47:07,030 --> 00:47:10,400
Come on. He's got fucking glitter
all over his body. It's Marin makeup.

833
00:47:10,401 --> 00:47:14,300
He's got makeup on. Yeah.
What the fuck where? Whatever
you want. Who gives a shit?

834
00:47:14,420 --> 00:47:18,470
That's the problem is people were
getting genuinely upset about something.

835
00:47:18,471 --> 00:47:20,980
That's none of their fucking business.
Absolutely,

836
00:47:21,080 --> 00:47:24,470
and they're just deciding that because
they've met women who have dressed sexy.

837
00:47:24,650 --> 00:47:27,080
All women would dress sexy, are
idiots, and they do with men.

838
00:47:27,200 --> 00:47:30,200
The men who work out in many
workout of fucking Meta. Oh,

839
00:47:30,260 --> 00:47:31,660
what are you going to the gym,
meathead.

840
00:47:31,870 --> 00:47:35,350
They'll delve diminish you because you
work out. It's the same thing, you know.

841
00:47:35,351 --> 00:47:38,890
Go Steve. Nice tight shirt. Yeah
it is. A lot of it comes through.

842
00:47:38,960 --> 00:47:43,480
Looks good to be honest with you. Of
course it is, right? Yeah, of course.

843
00:47:43,481 --> 00:47:46,210
I mean if you're a hot dude who's been
working out and you're getting criticism

844
00:47:46,211 --> 00:47:50,260
from other guys because you're a meathead,
you're coming from a jealous place.

845
00:47:50,290 --> 00:47:52,360
I liked it.
They've invented that dude bro thing.

846
00:47:52,361 --> 00:47:55,840
Cause it really is very
quickly diminishing. Yeah.
Like if someone says anything,

847
00:47:55,841 --> 00:47:59,230
yeah, he's the most dude bro Guy
ever. Ooh. Wow. That fucking hurts.

848
00:47:59,750 --> 00:48:02,920
Actually it works. Cause he ever knows
what they're talking about. You know,

849
00:48:02,921 --> 00:48:04,680
like a dude bro.
It's just like a blur.

850
00:48:05,920 --> 00:48:09,340
It's such a great thing to say because
he can't even get upset at someone saying

851
00:48:09,341 --> 00:48:11,860
it. Cause it's not even like
you're a cunt face. You know?

852
00:48:11,861 --> 00:48:14,260
It's like he's a dude bro.
Like I don't even know what you said.

853
00:48:14,261 --> 00:48:18,460
They don't know what that
means. So diminishing, but
it's so effective. Yeah. Yeah.

854
00:48:19,360 --> 00:48:21,050
Well, you know, people
are weird. They're weird.

855
00:48:21,120 --> 00:48:23,800
We're weird at what we get upset
about, you know, me included,

856
00:48:23,801 --> 00:48:26,410
I get upset about shit and then I go,
why do I care what the fuck is wrong with?

857
00:48:26,470 --> 00:48:28,120
Okay, yeah, that happens time to time.

858
00:48:28,200 --> 00:48:31,060
I will definitely feel that
especially doing what I do.

859
00:48:31,120 --> 00:48:33,340
Like sometimes I'll get upset
about a story and I'm like, wait,

860
00:48:33,400 --> 00:48:35,630
why am I letting this get
to me? Yeah. You know,

861
00:48:35,650 --> 00:48:40,650
and then sometimes we'll do a story where
it'll have this profound effect on me

862
00:48:41,590 --> 00:48:42,423
recently.
Um,

863
00:48:42,520 --> 00:48:46,120
I don't know if you read about George
Stinney who was executed in 1944.

864
00:48:46,121 --> 00:48:49,610
This 14 year old boy,
I heard that he was exonerated recently.

865
00:48:49,640 --> 00:48:52,950
He was exonerated recently
executed in 1944, um,

866
00:48:53,020 --> 00:48:57,190
because he was convicted of
killing two white girls. Uh,

867
00:48:57,191 --> 00:49:00,760
so he had nothing to do with it, as
you guys know, exonerated recently.

868
00:49:01,210 --> 00:49:02,740
And um,

869
00:49:02,800 --> 00:49:07,750
we were doing the show and our
COO Steevo came in and he's like,

870
00:49:07,751 --> 00:49:09,550
hey guys,
I'm sorry to interrupt the show,

871
00:49:09,551 --> 00:49:12,460
but I want to give you a quick update
on a story that I find important.

872
00:49:12,460 --> 00:49:13,570
And then he gave us the details.

873
00:49:13,571 --> 00:49:16,270
I had never heard about George
Stinney until that moment.

874
00:49:16,870 --> 00:49:19,360
And I don't know what it was.

875
00:49:19,390 --> 00:49:23,320
But when he told me about that 14
year old who weighed 90 pounds getting

876
00:49:23,321 --> 00:49:26,920
executed for a crime, he didn't
commit. I couldn't hold back tears.

877
00:49:27,190 --> 00:49:30,190
And for the first time in a really,
really long time,

878
00:49:30,550 --> 00:49:34,720
I was about to burst into tears on
camera and we had to go to break.

879
00:49:34,721 --> 00:49:37,900
So I can kind of like,
you know, contain myself.

880
00:49:37,930 --> 00:49:40,390
Do you not want people
to see you grow? Um, I,

881
00:49:40,570 --> 00:49:43,270
so I want to be as a woman,

882
00:49:43,271 --> 00:49:46,720
it's difficult because you don't
want people to immediately go to, oh,

883
00:49:46,721 --> 00:49:50,590
she's just an emotional female. She's
not a reliable source of news. Right.

884
00:49:50,860 --> 00:49:53,770
A lot of people think that if
you're passionate about something,

885
00:49:53,980 --> 00:49:57,280
that means that you're irrational and
that you're just an emotional girl.

886
00:49:57,281 --> 00:50:00,070
And so I go out of my
way regardless of how,

887
00:50:00,790 --> 00:50:02,530
how much I want to like break down.

888
00:50:02,531 --> 00:50:05,530
I go out of my way to make sure
I don't cry on camera. Cause.

889
00:50:05,531 --> 00:50:07,540
And then also whenever you cry on camera,

890
00:50:08,050 --> 00:50:11,110
I immediately think of like the Glen
Becks of the world who were like super

891
00:50:11,111 --> 00:50:13,450
fucking cheesy and they like,
they're doing it,

892
00:50:13,510 --> 00:50:15,390
they're doing it to ham up the audience.
Right.

893
00:50:15,470 --> 00:50:15,681
Yeah.

894
00:50:15,681 --> 00:50:20,090
I don't think you should ever worry about
being fake because you don't give off

895
00:50:20,120 --> 00:50:24,050
any of that. So I think if you felt
like crying on camera, cry on camera,

896
00:50:24,051 --> 00:50:26,300
but if you don't feel like crying on
camera, you don't have to do that either.

897
00:50:26,340 --> 00:50:28,040
Yeah. That's, it's interesting

898
00:50:28,040 --> 00:50:31,280
to wonder why. Like I've never cried
on camera either, but I've cried.

899
00:50:31,310 --> 00:50:34,900
I've cried it on movies
and shit. Yeah. I cry.

900
00:50:35,390 --> 00:50:37,310
I have daughters are crazy.
I'm a bit

901
00:50:37,580 --> 00:50:38,540
aw,

902
00:50:41,510 --> 00:50:45,080
I do, I cry. I cry for no
fucking reason. Uh, it's,

903
00:50:45,230 --> 00:50:49,410
it's pretty easy to like a good song
or a good like, you know, especially

904
00:50:50,940 --> 00:50:54,000
anything where anything where,
you know,

905
00:50:54,300 --> 00:50:57,910
people are losing loved ones. So, yeah.

906
00:50:58,590 --> 00:51:02,070
I remember I watched this documentary
once. It was like a one of these,

907
00:51:02,071 --> 00:51:04,590
I'm not a documentary, like a, um,

908
00:51:04,620 --> 00:51:09,390
it was a cable show that was documenting
Malibu fires and these fires where it's

909
00:51:09,391 --> 00:51:11,850
just devastating fires that
swept through this hillside,

910
00:51:11,851 --> 00:51:15,460
destroyed all these homes.
And this one guy who was a fireman and a,

911
00:51:15,490 --> 00:51:19,850
he had a house that he worked his
whole life to build. And um, he,

912
00:51:19,860 --> 00:51:22,350
he built it himself and you know,
it didn't make a lot of money,

913
00:51:22,351 --> 00:51:25,680
but he saved up enough to buy this piece
of land and literally build his own

914
00:51:25,681 --> 00:51:28,470
house over the course of
several years by himself.

915
00:51:28,680 --> 00:51:32,910
And he was living in it and his house
was spared, but his neighbors wasn't.

916
00:51:32,911 --> 00:51:36,330
And this guy was just weeping,
just weeping,

917
00:51:36,750 --> 00:51:39,960
weeping for his
neighborhood, for, you know,

918
00:51:39,961 --> 00:51:43,980
the idea of losing his own house
and this whole thing. And, uh,

919
00:51:44,040 --> 00:51:48,810
I was watching this in the green room
of a show that I was about to do. Oh.

920
00:51:49,050 --> 00:51:52,980
And then I had to go on stage is where
before I realized you can't do that.

921
00:51:53,190 --> 00:51:57,900
Like I'd only been doing comedy a few
years. I Wa I was a rookie. And so, uh,

922
00:51:57,901 --> 00:52:00,120
I was doing this show with this guy,
JB Smoove.

923
00:52:00,180 --> 00:52:04,800
I don't know if you know who he is. He
was on a curb. Your enthusiasm. Hilarious.

924
00:52:04,801 --> 00:52:08,160
Hilarious comedian. And it was supposed
to be, JB was supposed to go up first,

925
00:52:08,170 --> 00:52:11,130
but then I was supposed to go up second.
But JB got lost.

926
00:52:11,460 --> 00:52:14,190
It was a college in New Jersey and
he was in the middle of nowhere.

927
00:52:14,190 --> 00:52:18,300
It was really hard to find. I got
there early, but I was, I went, I got,

928
00:52:18,301 --> 00:52:20,730
I left way early and just got there early.

929
00:52:21,360 --> 00:52:23,850
So they told me to just sit in the
green room and watch some TV and relax.

930
00:52:24,180 --> 00:52:25,710
No worries.
We'll start the show whenever.

931
00:52:25,950 --> 00:52:30,060
And so I'm sitting there watching these
people cry in this girl calling for her

932
00:52:30,061 --> 00:52:34,140
dog. She's calling for a dog,
you know, she's like rusty,

933
00:52:34,440 --> 00:52:37,170
rusty. That fucking dog is
dead. You know, it's dead.

934
00:52:37,171 --> 00:52:41,670
And you got a camera on this girl while
she's calling for this nonexistent doc.

935
00:52:41,730 --> 00:52:43,240
It's a God damn inferno.

936
00:52:43,260 --> 00:52:46,500
It looks like Satan came over the
mountain with fucking flaming horses.

937
00:52:46,710 --> 00:52:50,790
It looks horrible and they're focusing
on this girl. There's sucking you in,

938
00:52:50,940 --> 00:52:52,800
showing you the humanity of the situation.

939
00:52:55,550 --> 00:52:59,600
Oh my God. Crying like a bitch and then I
got to go on stage. No, that's tough man.

940
00:52:59,601 --> 00:53:02,030
That's tough. It's hard to, you know,

941
00:53:02,540 --> 00:53:05,670
gather your thoughts after you see
something traumatic like that and it,

942
00:53:05,671 --> 00:53:10,490
it really like hits you the first time.
I've only cried on camera twice. Okay.

943
00:53:10,491 --> 00:53:15,050
So I just mentioned the George Stinney
story. That was the recent incident. Um,

944
00:53:15,080 --> 00:53:19,070
the first time I ever cried on camera
was actually years ago and we did a story

945
00:53:19,100 --> 00:53:23,870
about, I think it was a natural
disaster that happens somewhere,

946
00:53:23,871 --> 00:53:26,130
I don't remember. But um, someone

947
00:53:26,130 --> 00:53:31,130
had died and as a result of the natural
disaster and he got buried and there was

948
00:53:31,261 --> 00:53:35,430
this photo of his dog just
sitting and waiting by his grave.

949
00:53:35,970 --> 00:53:36,781
And I don't know,

950
00:53:36,781 --> 00:53:41,781
like I just like understanding the
loyalty of that dog and he's there.

951
00:53:42,060 --> 00:53:45,930
He showed that someone didn't tell him
to lie down, right? No, no. It was, no,

952
00:53:45,931 --> 00:53:46,830
it was a real story.

953
00:53:46,831 --> 00:53:51,831
I don't know if the dog had like maybe
the family members went to the burial or

954
00:53:52,201 --> 00:53:56,640
whatever and the dog route, like
realized that I have no idea. But it was,

955
00:53:56,960 --> 00:54:01,190
and it was, it was reported by a
very credible news organizations.

956
00:54:01,191 --> 00:54:05,970
So it wasn't like, oh look, this was
posted on reddit and it's real. No,

957
00:54:05,971 --> 00:54:07,910
it was like,
yeah,

958
00:54:07,911 --> 00:54:11,570
well it was like the Associated Press
or Reuters or something like that. Um,

959
00:54:11,670 --> 00:54:15,630
the problem with those stories as they
sound great and so there's no harm in

960
00:54:15,631 --> 00:54:16,920
them being bullshit.
Yeah.

961
00:54:16,921 --> 00:54:20,260
You can just put it out there was a dog
and a fucking come around you out. No,

962
00:54:20,360 --> 00:54:23,070
the dog's going to be like, Yo, this
is bullshit. Do they gave me a bone.

963
00:54:23,071 --> 00:54:24,090
They told me the light on there.

964
00:54:24,091 --> 00:54:27,840
I don't know where that dude's bird
fuck this bullshit stories bullshit.

965
00:54:28,200 --> 00:54:32,820
So it's a no risk so they can just
make shit up. Well that's true. Yes.

966
00:54:32,850 --> 00:54:35,910
And you're right. That's like a
harmless made up story if it is made up.

967
00:54:36,210 --> 00:54:40,980
But the worst thing is when you have like
credible news organizations or like a

968
00:54:40,981 --> 00:54:44,490
magazine like rolling
stone doing a really,

969
00:54:44,491 --> 00:54:48,220
really terrible job with that Uva
story. Do you know about that? Yes.

970
00:54:48,660 --> 00:54:50,490
That's unfortunate.
It's unfortunate

971
00:54:50,580 --> 00:54:52,590
because you know,

972
00:54:52,591 --> 00:54:57,370
it's very unfortunate when you
release a story that has troubles, um,

973
00:54:57,750 --> 00:54:59,850
and that these troubles could
have been investigated before,

974
00:55:00,270 --> 00:55:01,950
especially when it's on a very,
very,

975
00:55:01,951 --> 00:55:05,160
very sensitive topic that everyone
knows needs to be addressed. Everyone,

976
00:55:05,430 --> 00:55:08,400
I don't think there's a single person
that doesn't believe it's sexual assault

977
00:55:08,401 --> 00:55:12,690
isn't a problem. It's a huge
problem. You haven't been online.

978
00:55:13,310 --> 00:55:16,440
No. Everybody must know. Everybody
must know that it's possible.

979
00:55:16,590 --> 00:55:20,670
Everybody must know that women
can get sexually assaulted,
right? So whenever you,

980
00:55:20,671 --> 00:55:24,960
you know that that is true, it has
happened. It's 100%. It's undeniable.

981
00:55:25,410 --> 00:55:29,730
If you have a situation where
someone is accusing someone of,

982
00:55:29,731 --> 00:55:30,800
covering something up along,

983
00:55:30,801 --> 00:55:33,240
it's like you've got to go over
that bitch with a fine tooth comb.

984
00:55:33,420 --> 00:55:37,560
You can't leave them with any evidence
that points because it not only is if,

985
00:55:37,561 --> 00:55:42,090
if you, if you fail to make a credible
story that can't be backed up,

986
00:55:42,390 --> 00:55:45,060
not only does it fail in that attempt,

987
00:55:45,061 --> 00:55:48,510
but it strengthened the resolve of the
other people that think there's a lot of

988
00:55:48,511 --> 00:55:51,470
false rape accusers,
100%

989
00:55:51,500 --> 00:55:55,730
I that story did so much damage
to those who actually are,

990
00:55:56,060 --> 00:56:00,110
and who knows? This Jackie girl
might actually be a rape victim,

991
00:56:00,111 --> 00:56:02,780
but maybe she can't recall the
specific events. I don't know.

992
00:56:02,781 --> 00:56:04,460
I don't know what her story is.
I have no evidence.

993
00:56:04,461 --> 00:56:07,790
I don't even want to comment
on that. Right? But regardless,

994
00:56:08,060 --> 00:56:11,990
the misreporting and the misinformation
that was portrayed in that rolling stone

995
00:56:11,991 --> 00:56:16,991
piece does a disservice to the actual
rape victims out there who are trying to

996
00:56:17,391 --> 00:56:18,560
get people to believe them.

997
00:56:18,561 --> 00:56:23,260
But people are denying that they went
through something as terrible as rape. And

998
00:56:24,100 --> 00:56:27,250
it's funny, I teach a journalism
course at cal state Northridge, right?

999
00:56:27,760 --> 00:56:32,110
And Journalism Ethics One oh one is
that you get both sides of the story.

1000
00:56:32,111 --> 00:56:36,070
That doesn't mean that you are neutral.
You should be objective. Right?

1001
00:56:36,400 --> 00:56:39,340
But don't be like, oh,
this side says this,

1002
00:56:39,341 --> 00:56:42,370
that side says that now you guys
decide I'm against that. Right.

1003
00:56:42,371 --> 00:56:46,570
But you still have to get both sides
of the story and then you as an

1004
00:56:46,571 --> 00:56:49,660
investigative journalists need to
go out there and seek the truth.

1005
00:56:49,930 --> 00:56:51,760
And that didn't happen with
the rolling stone piece.

1006
00:56:51,790 --> 00:56:56,200
They agreed with Jackie that they would
not corroborate her account of the

1007
00:56:56,201 --> 00:56:59,830
events with anyone else. What kind of
fucking journalism is that? That's crazy.

1008
00:57:00,310 --> 00:57:04,120
I mean that story actually really pissed
me off because that did a lot of harm.

1009
00:57:04,370 --> 00:57:08,210
How do you think that that kind of an
agreement gets put into place where

1010
00:57:08,211 --> 00:57:12,200
someone says, we won't
corroborate the facts of the case?

1011
00:57:12,201 --> 00:57:14,570
Like we won't try to
investigate it any further.

1012
00:57:14,571 --> 00:57:17,540
Like why would someone agree to that?
It doesn't really make sense. Right?

1013
00:57:17,610 --> 00:57:20,580
I think maybe I'm going to give
them the benefit of the doubt,

1014
00:57:20,610 --> 00:57:25,610
but maybe they understood that this is a
sensitive story and here is a woman who

1015
00:57:27,751 --> 00:57:31,740
is a potential rape victim and they
want to be very sensitive to her.

1016
00:57:32,220 --> 00:57:35,880
And so they kind of like
walk on egg shells for her.

1017
00:57:36,330 --> 00:57:40,530
But so that's like the best case scenario
for rolling stone if that's what their

1018
00:57:40,531 --> 00:57:43,320
intentions were.
The worst case scenario is if,

1019
00:57:43,321 --> 00:57:44,910
and I don't know if this is the case,

1020
00:57:45,120 --> 00:57:50,120
but if you have a journalist who has her
own biases and she uses those biases to

1021
00:57:51,271 --> 00:57:54,810
justify only using one
source for her story,

1022
00:57:55,230 --> 00:57:59,820
I don't know which one of
those two scenarios actually
occurred, but nonetheless,

1023
00:57:59,850 --> 00:58:02,970
the outcome was disastrous and it was,

1024
00:58:02,971 --> 00:58:06,120
I mean that story came out,
um,

1025
00:58:06,390 --> 00:58:09,420
or the aftermath of that story came
out when my class was winding down.

1026
00:58:09,421 --> 00:58:12,510
But if I get the honor of
teaching that class again,

1027
00:58:12,511 --> 00:58:15,570
I'm going to bring up that case and
I'm going to be like, do not do this.

1028
00:58:15,600 --> 00:58:18,420
This is the most irresponsible
type of journalism you can do.

1029
00:58:19,090 --> 00:58:23,110
It's super unfortunate too
because it can be avoided. Yeah,

1030
00:58:23,230 --> 00:58:24,670
it can be avoided with due diligence.

1031
00:58:24,671 --> 00:58:28,870
And that's the one thing that people
complain the most about like web sites.

1032
00:58:29,050 --> 00:58:32,560
Like they don't really,
they're not really under any supervision.

1033
00:58:32,590 --> 00:58:33,650
Like they could do whatever they want.

1034
00:58:33,651 --> 00:58:36,040
And you have excellent ones
and you have piss poor ones.

1035
00:58:36,170 --> 00:58:38,980
You have ones that report things
that are just totally made up.

1036
00:58:39,130 --> 00:58:39,970
I can't tell you how many,

1037
00:58:40,360 --> 00:58:42,630
how many times a week someone
sends you something that's,

1038
00:58:42,700 --> 00:58:46,040
it's not even a parody site, it's just
a complete made up site. They were,

1039
00:58:46,060 --> 00:58:50,110
there was a site where someone was sending
me new species of Hominid found and

1040
00:58:50,120 --> 00:58:54,250
they thought that they found
dead leprechauns these,
this a dude like he's, he's,

1041
00:58:54,430 --> 00:58:55,390
he's sweeping.

1042
00:58:55,391 --> 00:58:58,120
He's usually like a paintbrush to sweep
the side of a mountain and there's a

1043
00:58:58,121 --> 00:59:02,050
little dead leprechaun skeleton. Like, get
the fuck out of here, dude. It's really,

1044
00:59:02,051 --> 00:59:06,540
send me this. You asshole. But that's,
you know, that's the internet, you know,

1045
00:59:06,550 --> 00:59:08,050
and that's beautiful.
You can do whatever you want,

1046
00:59:08,051 --> 00:59:11,870
but you don't expect that
from like rolling stone from
rolling stone. I expect,

1047
00:59:12,290 --> 00:59:14,770
you know, it's God damn. That's where
hunters Thompson used to, right.

1048
00:59:14,810 --> 00:59:18,310
You're supposed to have like the
highest journalistic ethics ever.

1049
00:59:18,311 --> 00:59:21,050
You talk about important stories. You
have Matt motherfucking [inaudible] the,

1050
00:59:21,090 --> 00:59:22,220
I was about to mention,

1051
00:59:22,220 --> 00:59:27,050
I mean, Matt Taibbi is
amazing. He's a monster. He's
a freaking muck. Yeah, he is.

1052
00:59:27,051 --> 00:59:29,120
He's the most ever at that.
He's the best ever it down.

1053
00:59:29,121 --> 00:59:33,400
And he's brilliant to read too. It's, it's
fun stuff. Like he's, you know, he's a,

1054
00:59:33,401 --> 00:59:37,900
he's a, he's a fucking, he's a
journalistic gangsters. What it really is,

1055
00:59:37,901 --> 00:59:42,320
it really is. I mean, there are very few
journalists out there that I look up to.

1056
00:59:42,321 --> 00:59:45,590
Matt Taibbi is certainly one
of them. And so, so yeah,

1057
00:59:45,591 --> 00:59:49,640
I mean I think that that rolling stone
piece regarding Uva not only did damage

1058
00:59:49,641 --> 00:59:53,510
to people that have been raped, but it
also did damage to their own magazine.

1059
00:59:53,511 --> 00:59:57,650
It did damage to the other reporters
out there who do the due diligence

1060
00:59:57,651 --> 01:00:01,230
necessary to put out a responsible
news report. I don't know.

1061
01:00:01,280 --> 01:00:04,580
It was disheartening.
I did not like that at all.

1062
01:00:04,700 --> 01:00:07,670
I think people get super scared and
sensitive when it's dealing with that

1063
01:00:07,671 --> 01:00:12,260
subject. The subject of rape. It's
such a, you know, a dark subject.

1064
01:00:12,320 --> 01:00:16,040
So when people are dealing
with that, I think, you know,
sometimes they, they just,

1065
01:00:16,400 --> 01:00:21,400
they don't look at things as objectively
as they could if they weren't like

1066
01:00:22,881 --> 01:00:27,881
really locked into this like very kid
gloves approach to this one subject mean

1067
01:00:28,130 --> 01:00:31,990
all subjects were a victim or awful.
Whether it's molestation,

1068
01:00:32,210 --> 01:00:34,580
whether it's violence,
whether it's any, you know,

1069
01:00:34,610 --> 01:00:37,880
anything that happens like person
to person, human interactions,

1070
01:00:38,240 --> 01:00:41,420
it gets fucking sensitive is shit
including sexual stuff like rape.

1071
01:00:41,421 --> 01:00:42,680
It's all like super sensitive.

1072
01:00:42,681 --> 01:00:45,920
But when you're talking about
like a crime in a story,

1073
01:00:46,610 --> 01:00:51,610
there's this real fear of blaming the
victim or this real fear of questioning

1074
01:00:51,981 --> 01:00:54,950
the victim and the real fear of stepping.
I mean,

1075
01:00:54,951 --> 01:00:58,370
can imagine the horror of being raped
and then the horror of someone accusing

1076
01:00:58,371 --> 01:01:01,470
you of lying about that rate when
it actually has happened. So that's,

1077
01:01:01,510 --> 01:01:04,370
it's very weighted because of
that. Rightly so. You know,

1078
01:01:04,371 --> 01:01:07,430
so everybody that approaches the
subject of rape is like very,

1079
01:01:07,431 --> 01:01:09,320
very kind and sensitive about it.

1080
01:01:09,321 --> 01:01:14,060
But it seems like in this case it's just
a fuck up because you're talking about

1081
01:01:14,061 --> 01:01:18,080
stuff that wouldn't be that hard to
look up. Like you could, you could just,

1082
01:01:18,081 --> 01:01:20,690
you know, and you don't even have
to like do it with that person.

1083
01:01:20,691 --> 01:01:23,240
You just start doing some
work and find out, you know,

1084
01:01:23,270 --> 01:01:26,560
who was in what fraternity and what,
what's social affairs were.

1085
01:01:26,610 --> 01:01:31,220
I mean they have to like keep logs of
shit and Jackie described someone that she

1086
01:01:31,221 --> 01:01:34,520
knew from years prior that
doesn't even go to the school.

1087
01:01:34,521 --> 01:01:39,440
I mean just simple little details from
her story. You can corroborate without,

1088
01:01:39,441 --> 01:01:43,310
let's say you don't want to talk to
anyone who was one of the alleged rapist,

1089
01:01:43,430 --> 01:01:45,690
right? Cause she was
allegedly gang raped. Right.

1090
01:01:45,830 --> 01:01:49,730
Let's say you want to just check
on the little facts like, okay,

1091
01:01:50,120 --> 01:01:55,100
was there a party thrown by the fraternity
on the date that Jackie specified?

1092
01:01:55,280 --> 01:01:57,410
That's a very simple thing to check out.

1093
01:01:57,440 --> 01:02:01,070
They didn't do that
irresponsible to save the least.

1094
01:02:01,100 --> 01:02:03,860
It's just crazy that it's rolling stone.
That's what's crazy.

1095
01:02:03,920 --> 01:02:07,130
It's just so it seems that, um,
it's also, everybody's like,

1096
01:02:07,760 --> 01:02:10,790
there's so much content out there. I
mean, there's so many different websites.

1097
01:02:10,791 --> 01:02:13,810
There's so much competition. There's
some, I mean, I think people were many,

1098
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:18,440
maybe many times in a rush to get
salacious stories out because you know,

1099
01:02:18,441 --> 01:02:19,770
anything that's very

1100
01:02:20,460 --> 01:02:24,240
prominent and terrifying, like,
like, uh, a gang rape, you know,

1101
01:02:24,241 --> 01:02:26,820
people who have daughters think about,
oh my God, [inaudible] gang rape,

1102
01:02:26,850 --> 01:02:28,950
what he did,
why he got away with it.

1103
01:02:29,490 --> 01:02:33,090
And then there's also the issue of people
that experienced trauma that they lose

1104
01:02:33,091 --> 01:02:37,020
a lot of memory. That's a fact. People,
people who've had traumatic experiences,

1105
01:02:37,160 --> 01:02:41,420
the, the very impactful
emotions and fear and, and,

1106
01:02:41,690 --> 01:02:45,210
and self loathing and all the shit
that comes, a traumatic experiences.

1107
01:02:45,240 --> 01:02:46,800
A lot of times people black things out.

1108
01:02:47,100 --> 01:02:51,060
Like there's a lot of people who have
PTSD for events that have happened in

1109
01:02:51,061 --> 01:02:53,700
their life and they, you know,
really violent events, especially,

1110
01:02:53,701 --> 01:02:56,250
they just block them out. Like, you know,

1111
01:02:56,251 --> 01:03:00,090
I've talked to people that don't remember,
like big chunks of their life. Yeah.

1112
01:03:00,300 --> 01:03:02,430
And it's people who've
experienced some fucked up shit.

1113
01:03:02,490 --> 01:03:06,420
Exactly. Which is why it could have
happened. What could easily happen,

1114
01:03:06,450 --> 01:03:11,280
what Jackie mentioned or told a rolling
stone could have happened, but again,

1115
01:03:11,281 --> 01:03:15,600
it's up to rolling stone to do its due
diligence and make sure that everything

1116
01:03:15,601 --> 01:03:17,910
that she is reporting to them.
Yeah,

1117
01:03:17,970 --> 01:03:19,680
it's true. Yeah. There's sauce.

1118
01:03:19,710 --> 01:03:24,150
There's real issue of people just
not being truthful and being crazy.

1119
01:03:24,540 --> 01:03:27,330
You know, people like to
make things up. There are,

1120
01:03:27,360 --> 01:03:30,660
there are a certain amount of
people that for whatever reason,

1121
01:03:31,230 --> 01:03:34,230
they just will start talking and the
words will come out and they're just

1122
01:03:34,231 --> 01:03:37,110
talking about shit that actually never
really happened and they're just making

1123
01:03:37,111 --> 01:03:40,200
things up and I've met a bunch of
them. I'm sure you have to. Of course,

1124
01:03:40,710 --> 01:03:45,180
it's possible you can do it. You can like
lie and get pretty fucking far in life.

1125
01:03:45,181 --> 01:03:48,960
You can totally sneak through certain
gates and climb over certain walls.

1126
01:03:48,970 --> 01:03:50,160
Make it til you make it.
Yeah.

1127
01:03:50,190 --> 01:03:51,780
There's a lot of people to
get away with doing that.

1128
01:03:51,781 --> 01:03:56,490
So you'd never know when someone's telling
a story about anything where it's a,

1129
01:03:56,491 --> 01:04:00,870
he said, she said story, you really
never know until you look deeply into it.

1130
01:04:01,260 --> 01:04:02,100
What's going on.

1131
01:04:03,480 --> 01:04:07,230
Whatever small percentage of
false rape claims there are.

1132
01:04:07,231 --> 01:04:08,610
I don't know what the percentage is.

1133
01:04:08,611 --> 01:04:13,340
Like someone said it's like 2% or
something of all uh, rapes, uh, that are,

1134
01:04:13,341 --> 01:04:15,520
that people like claim
are false rape claim.

1135
01:04:15,521 --> 01:04:18,840
So it's just someone trying to get back
into ex boyfriend or someone trying to

1136
01:04:18,841 --> 01:04:22,350
fuck somebody over.
But that's still two out of a hundred.

1137
01:04:22,860 --> 01:04:24,580
You got to look at those.
Yeah. You got to you

1138
01:04:25,050 --> 01:04:27,330
those numbers aren't reliable.
You know,

1139
01:04:27,331 --> 01:04:31,320
it's really difficult to study something
like that. Um, but yeah, I mean

1140
01:04:31,660 --> 01:04:34,980
that's not victim blaming either. Okay.
That's just being rational and logical.

1141
01:04:35,010 --> 01:04:36,060
Yeah.
It's all that is.

1142
01:04:36,061 --> 01:04:38,840
And that there's this idea that you
shouldn't look at things rationally or

1143
01:04:38,841 --> 01:04:43,080
logical or you could, you shouldn't want
facts while still being kind, you know,

1144
01:04:43,081 --> 01:04:46,710
you can still be kind while you want
facts, you know. Look, it's unfortunate.

1145
01:04:47,130 --> 01:04:50,930
It's very unfortunate when you run into
someone who has made up stories cause

1146
01:04:50,931 --> 01:04:54,180
you're like, Oh you poor bastard,
you just as crazy liar person.

1147
01:04:54,430 --> 01:04:55,210
Yeah.

1148
01:04:55,210 --> 01:04:59,560
You know what's also really crazy is a
over the last two years there there've

1149
01:04:59,561 --> 01:05:03,730
been a number of stories of like teenage
girls who have been raped, right.

1150
01:05:03,731 --> 01:05:05,590
Drugged and raped at these parties.
Right.

1151
01:05:05,980 --> 01:05:10,390
And then they're rapists will take
pictures of them as they're passed out.

1152
01:05:10,391 --> 01:05:14,050
Naked Neuron. This is, this is
amazing. There was a girl named Jadah,

1153
01:05:14,080 --> 01:05:16,180
this happened to her and we
reported on her recently.

1154
01:05:16,840 --> 01:05:21,610
So rapist took pictures of her as she
was passed out and she had her leg bent

1155
01:05:21,611 --> 01:05:23,470
and like a peculiar position.

1156
01:05:23,920 --> 01:05:28,660
And then they started like basically
circulating that photo among their peers.

1157
01:05:28,661 --> 01:05:33,130
So all of a sudden a bunch of people
started bullying her for getting raped.

1158
01:05:33,580 --> 01:05:37,750
And so they started like a hashtag called
Jadah pose and they started posing in

1159
01:05:37,751 --> 01:05:42,220
pictures in the way that she was in
that photo. And just making fun of it,

1160
01:05:42,280 --> 01:05:45,730
like put, posting it on Twitter and
Facebook and bullying the crap out of her.

1161
01:05:46,300 --> 01:05:50,380
This happened in Houston and she,
what's amazing about this girl,

1162
01:05:50,381 --> 01:05:51,730
she was 16 when it happened.

1163
01:05:51,760 --> 01:05:55,420
She was resilient enough
to not let it destroy her.

1164
01:05:55,780 --> 01:05:59,830
And so the mainstream press has a policy
and I think it's a pretty good policy

1165
01:05:59,831 --> 01:06:00,664
of,
um,

1166
01:06:00,940 --> 01:06:05,260
hiding the name or the true identity of
a minor who's been sexually assaulted or

1167
01:06:05,261 --> 01:06:08,260
raped or anything like that. And
she came out and she's like, no,

1168
01:06:08,261 --> 01:06:11,980
I don't want anyone to hide my, my image.
I don't want anyone to hide my name.

1169
01:06:11,981 --> 01:06:13,960
I want to come out and
speak out against it.

1170
01:06:13,961 --> 01:06:18,040
Because a lot of teenagers go through
the same thing that I've been going

1171
01:06:18,041 --> 01:06:20,460
through and they, they
commit suicide. Right?

1172
01:06:20,830 --> 01:06:25,830
And so I think it's important to have a
really serious discussion about why kids

1173
01:06:26,051 --> 01:06:27,670
think that that kind of behavior is okay.

1174
01:06:27,671 --> 01:06:31,000
Because look in the school
district that I went to la USD,

1175
01:06:31,540 --> 01:06:34,960
we had comprehensive sex ED,
right? And in comprehensive sex Ed,

1176
01:06:35,050 --> 01:06:40,050
they talked about everything including
rape and sexual assault and molestation.

1177
01:06:40,271 --> 01:06:43,990
And those were really uncomfortable
conversations to have in middle school and

1178
01:06:43,991 --> 01:06:44,824
high school.

1179
01:06:44,980 --> 01:06:49,980
But I felt like my peers
had an understanding of
how serious situations like

1180
01:06:50,171 --> 01:06:53,320
that are and how you don't bully
someone who's a rape victim.

1181
01:06:53,770 --> 01:06:55,570
And since this happened in Houston,

1182
01:06:55,780 --> 01:06:59,530
I'm wondering whether or not they had the
exposure to the same type of education

1183
01:06:59,531 --> 01:07:00,550
that we had.
Right.

1184
01:07:00,790 --> 01:07:04,360
Because if you understand the
weight of sexual assault and rape,

1185
01:07:04,540 --> 01:07:08,620
you wouldn't make fun of
or bullied the victim.

1186
01:07:08,770 --> 01:07:11,680
You see what I'm saying? So
I don't know. I don't know.

1187
01:07:11,681 --> 01:07:15,130
That's just my speculation and
it's like a hypothesis that I have,

1188
01:07:15,131 --> 01:07:18,880
but I'm really curious to look into it
cause how vicious is that to make fun of

1189
01:07:18,881 --> 01:07:19,810
someone who's been raped,

1190
01:07:20,150 --> 01:07:24,170
children lack perspective, they don't
have a lot of experience in life.

1191
01:07:24,200 --> 01:07:27,140
And there's a lot of
what being a child is,

1192
01:07:27,440 --> 01:07:30,140
which is essentially a reflection of the
people that are around you when you're

1193
01:07:30,141 --> 01:07:32,990
growing up and they're very
young, they're, you know,

1194
01:07:32,991 --> 01:07:35,810
you're talking about kids that
are less than 18 years old, right?

1195
01:07:35,870 --> 01:07:40,870
They all have pathways that have been
beaten into their brain by either family

1196
01:07:41,091 --> 01:07:44,720
or circumstance or being around
the knuckleheads they're around.

1197
01:07:44,900 --> 01:07:48,140
And a lot of times they lack
perspective and people are also,

1198
01:07:48,141 --> 01:07:51,920
they're also terrified and
confused and everyone is,

1199
01:07:51,921 --> 01:07:56,330
I mean every fucking young kid that grows
up that is a bully is probably just as

1200
01:07:56,331 --> 01:07:59,240
scared if not more scared than
the people that are bullying.

1201
01:07:59,270 --> 01:08:02,000
They're all terrified. Of course
you're doing a bunch of stupid shit.

1202
01:08:02,360 --> 01:08:05,570
You know that's like a big part
of being a young person in the,

1203
01:08:05,571 --> 01:08:10,571
the what the real issue is is we shouldn't
have young kids alone that much with

1204
01:08:11,391 --> 01:08:14,150
each other cause they get
all lord of the flies. Okay.

1205
01:08:14,151 --> 01:08:16,190
They're supposed to young
should have parental

1206
01:08:16,190 --> 01:08:18,620
supervision and then when
they get into their teenagers,

1207
01:08:18,621 --> 01:08:23,030
he should still have a lot of
real grown ass men around. Yeah.

1208
01:08:23,050 --> 01:08:26,380
Go Hey fucker. Like settle down.
Like stop every, what is it?

1209
01:08:26,390 --> 01:08:27,680
What are you guys doing?
Like yeah.

1210
01:08:27,740 --> 01:08:31,430
Let me explain to you what's wrong about
your behavior from someone who they

1211
01:08:31,460 --> 01:08:35,330
trust. Like a real woman who is
running the class is going to go,

1212
01:08:35,331 --> 01:08:37,100
everybody sit the fuck down.

1213
01:08:37,360 --> 01:08:40,130
Like what are you thinking you're going
to accomplish with this? What do you,

1214
01:08:40,160 --> 01:08:43,550
what exactly do you think you're gonna
accomplish by running through my fucking

1215
01:08:43,551 --> 01:08:46,550
classroom? Throwing pencils at
each other and pulling hair.

1216
01:08:46,670 --> 01:08:48,940
You guys are fucking
crazy. Sit down. Yeah,

1217
01:08:49,040 --> 01:08:50,630
and someone who talks to
them like that where they go,

1218
01:08:50,631 --> 01:08:54,680
oh well I respect Mrs. Johnson. She's
told us shut the fuck up and sit down.

1219
01:08:54,800 --> 01:08:55,970
But a teacher can't even say that.

1220
01:08:55,971 --> 01:08:58,970
It can even speak in the language that
the kids use on a regular basis on their

1221
01:08:58,971 --> 01:09:02,450
own because that's profane and sometimes
it's the only way you can get their

1222
01:09:02,451 --> 01:09:03,020
attention.

1223
01:09:03,020 --> 01:09:03,381
Dude.

1224
01:09:03,381 --> 01:09:08,240
That's why I love teaching at a university
level because at least you're able to

1225
01:09:08,241 --> 01:09:09,890
have that type of freedom,
right?

1226
01:09:09,891 --> 01:09:14,320
Like no one's sitting there telling
you what type of language you can use

1227
01:09:14,440 --> 01:09:18,280
or what new swearing your class.
I swear my class all the time.

1228
01:09:18,660 --> 01:09:22,990
Your class is fin to get packed right
now? No, I love my class sign up.

1229
01:09:22,991 --> 01:09:25,930
Is it like when I have to,
do I have to take some tests and shit?

1230
01:09:26,110 --> 01:09:26,730
How do I get in this?

1231
01:09:26,730 --> 01:09:30,240
No test? I mean, it's
a broadcast news class.

1232
01:09:30,241 --> 01:09:32,280
So I teach them how to put
news packages together.

1233
01:09:32,281 --> 01:09:35,280
We do mock production meetings that are
very similar to what you would have in

1234
01:09:35,281 --> 01:09:39,840
like a real newsroom. It's a fun class.
I love it. It's very interactive. Um,

1235
01:09:39,870 --> 01:09:43,710
but I tell them in the beginning like,
look, I'm not much older than you guys.

1236
01:09:43,711 --> 01:09:47,730
I'm 28, um, I cause I'm going to
talk to you as if I'm your peer,

1237
01:09:47,940 --> 01:09:52,020
but I'm not an easy professor. So
don't take advantage of that. Like,

1238
01:09:52,021 --> 01:09:54,720
I want to have a discussion.
I want us to like understand each other.

1239
01:09:54,721 --> 01:09:58,440
Like I have that whole spiel in the very
beginning and I want them to open up,

1240
01:09:58,441 --> 01:09:58,741
you know,

1241
01:09:58,741 --> 01:10:03,030
I want them to trust me and I want
them to respect me and have like a real

1242
01:10:03,031 --> 01:10:05,700
conversation with me when I'm
actually doing my lectures.

1243
01:10:05,701 --> 01:10:10,020
Because there's nothing worse than having
some monotone old fuddy duddy come in

1244
01:10:10,021 --> 01:10:13,770
and tell you like, okay, today we're
going to talk about journalistic ethics.

1245
01:10:14,070 --> 01:10:16,710
They're not going to pay attention
to that. I've had those professors.

1246
01:10:17,030 --> 01:10:19,400
Yeah.
So we use the word fuddy duddy

1247
01:10:22,990 --> 01:10:26,410
just knowing what a fuddy duddy is.
Yeah,

1248
01:10:26,460 --> 01:10:30,290
I mean people definitely would rather
communicate with somebody who they feel

1249
01:10:30,291 --> 01:10:33,440
like it's a regular person and you know,
university level.

1250
01:10:33,441 --> 01:10:36,770
Of course you could do that,
but with kids like my God,

1251
01:10:37,100 --> 01:10:39,590
you know like leaving them
alone to be mean to each other.

1252
01:10:39,591 --> 01:10:43,250
These 13 to 14 year olds like Hobo,
everybody fucking settled down like,

1253
01:10:43,350 --> 01:10:45,200
what do you guys, you don't even
know what you're doing here.

1254
01:10:45,550 --> 01:10:47,420
Are you being mean to this little girl?

1255
01:10:47,421 --> 01:10:50,570
Because somebody drugged her and fucked
her. Do you know how crazy that is?

1256
01:10:50,571 --> 01:10:54,140
Like you girls out of your mind like
ticket and also kids get ramped up and

1257
01:10:54,141 --> 01:10:57,170
rivalries to the point where
they want each other dead kid.

1258
01:10:57,171 --> 01:10:59,420
Like 14 year old kids
will fight to the death.

1259
01:10:59,630 --> 01:11:01,640
Like they literally
have this fucking bitch,

1260
01:11:01,641 --> 01:11:04,460
I want her dead and they fucking get out
of school and hit each other with their

1261
01:11:04,461 --> 01:11:06,770
purses and pull hair and dudes will like,

1262
01:11:07,520 --> 01:11:11,840
teenage boys are some of the most
dangerous people you ever run into because

1263
01:11:11,841 --> 01:11:14,280
they're physically, they start, they're
starting to get their testosterone,

1264
01:11:14,280 --> 01:11:16,620
they're starting to get strong.
They and they've only been doing,

1265
01:11:16,660 --> 01:11:19,170
they've only been strong for
a very short amount of time.

1266
01:11:19,440 --> 01:11:24,180
Like an 18 year old boy is essentially
only been man strong for like two years.

1267
01:11:24,510 --> 01:11:26,220
So he has this new thing over the lip,

1268
01:11:26,250 --> 01:11:29,830
sweet 16 and 18 I'm might be able
to fuck this dude up, you know,

1269
01:11:29,831 --> 01:11:33,870
and they have this weird thing about
them that they have to manage and if they

1270
01:11:33,871 --> 01:11:37,020
do that without any guidance,
if they do that with any supervision of,

1271
01:11:37,021 --> 01:11:40,140
they definitely do that without any tests,
trials and tribulations.

1272
01:11:40,290 --> 01:11:44,940
If they just don't ever get to express
that violent chimpanzee eco that's

1273
01:11:44,941 --> 01:11:48,850
ringing around inside our Adams, if
they don't express that, they'll,

1274
01:11:48,870 --> 01:11:52,200
they won't be able to control it. It,
it'll spin out into the trees. They don't,

1275
01:11:52,201 --> 01:11:53,620
they won't know what the
fuck they're doing. I mean,

1276
01:11:53,690 --> 01:11:56,040
this is part of the reason why growing up,

1277
01:11:56,041 --> 01:11:59,610
my mom never let me go to sleep
overs or camp or anything like that.

1278
01:11:59,610 --> 01:12:01,320
I'm sure like that engage shit.

1279
01:12:01,440 --> 01:12:05,940
Probably the prevalence of sexual assault.
What do you mean gay shit?

1280
01:12:05,970 --> 01:12:08,130
Girls get together camps.
Oh yeah.

1281
01:12:08,560 --> 01:12:12,950
I waited until I was like in my twenties
to get into that kind of stuff. Wow. Bao.

1282
01:12:13,220 --> 01:12:15,000
Um,
but yeah,

1283
01:12:15,001 --> 01:12:19,050
like I think my mom understood the kind
of things that happened when a bunch of

1284
01:12:19,051 --> 01:12:22,940
teenagers get together and
so she was like, nope, you're
not going anywhere. Yeah.

1285
01:12:23,130 --> 01:12:25,800
When I was, I went to boy scout camp
and they fucking tied this kid up,

1286
01:12:25,801 --> 01:12:28,580
but toothpaste all over his clothes,
they cheat. They took him, they,

1287
01:12:28,600 --> 01:12:30,690
they tied him to his,
uh,

1288
01:12:30,720 --> 01:12:34,320
his cot and they carry the cut into the
woods and we were in New Hampshire and

1289
01:12:34,321 --> 01:12:37,830
it was in the middle of fucking nowhere.
There was no light outside.

1290
01:12:38,040 --> 01:12:41,370
Like I'd never been to a place where it
was dark out because there was no moon

1291
01:12:41,371 --> 01:12:44,800
that night. You couldn't fucking
see your hand. Oh my God.

1292
01:12:44,801 --> 01:12:47,330
You're trying to see your hand.
You can't see your fucking hand.

1293
01:12:47,331 --> 01:12:51,090
Like there was no light. None.
And they put this to the fucking,

1294
01:12:51,330 --> 01:12:53,430
they brought them out into
the woods and left him there.

1295
01:12:53,431 --> 01:12:57,690
This guy is screaming soon.
Funny guys, this isn't funny.

1296
01:12:58,260 --> 01:13:01,890
And uh, they woke me up to one of
them grabbed me and I jumped up like,

1297
01:13:01,891 --> 01:13:04,080
fuck you dude.
You're not taking me out there.

1298
01:13:04,110 --> 01:13:07,230
I'm not going to that fucking woods.
God, they put toothpaste in your clothes.

1299
01:13:07,380 --> 01:13:10,310
It's very hard to get toothpaste
off your clothes. Is it? Yeah. Yeah.

1300
01:13:10,320 --> 01:13:12,720
You got to really scrub it. Dutch
shit, it doesn't just come off.

1301
01:13:12,750 --> 01:13:15,660
So you can't just put it in the washing
machine and it's gone. Well, you know,

1302
01:13:15,661 --> 01:13:19,550
we're in the woods to the wash and
close with like literally washboards.

1303
01:13:19,750 --> 01:13:23,010
I know it was a camp. We had
archery and shit. There was guns.

1304
01:13:23,011 --> 01:13:26,750
They give these little fucking psychos
guns. I was in the archery range. I heard.

1305
01:13:27,560 --> 01:13:30,220
I go, what the fuck is that
guy goes a ricochet. I go,

1306
01:13:30,240 --> 01:13:32,220
fucking ricochet just came near us.

1307
01:13:32,530 --> 01:13:34,890
It's why is someone shooting with
somebody probably hit a rock.

1308
01:13:34,891 --> 01:13:36,750
Probably an accident like foc,

1309
01:13:37,640 --> 01:13:42,270
little inner city fucking creepers going
to boy scout camp. We'll animals, man,

1310
01:13:42,480 --> 01:13:46,770
this is just making me not want to have
kids. I went once, I'm like, I'm good.

1311
01:13:46,900 --> 01:13:49,380
It was there for two weeks. Oh
my God. I miss my parents so bad.

1312
01:13:50,250 --> 01:13:54,330
Couldn't wait to get home. I was
like, how old are you? Such a bitch.

1313
01:13:54,660 --> 01:13:57,300
Um,
I was probably,

1314
01:13:57,301 --> 01:14:02,301
it was under 14 so it was
probably the 13 or 1213 oh fuck.

1315
01:14:02,960 --> 01:14:07,320
Whose dog? Animals savages and out here
going to boy scouts with cause plus,

1316
01:14:07,580 --> 01:14:11,500
you know, 13 or whatever the hell. I was
like, that's fucking young. You know,

1317
01:14:11,530 --> 01:14:12,190
you're out there

1318
01:14:12,190 --> 01:14:15,980
in the woods with a bunch of fucking
crazy dudes. You don't even know. Like,

1319
01:14:16,030 --> 01:14:19,840
Oh yeah, yeah, that's not
good. And this older kids too,

1320
01:14:20,020 --> 01:14:24,640
like some of the kids were like 15 1617
and a 17 year old kid and a 14 year old

1321
01:14:24,641 --> 01:14:26,750
kids should never be unsupervised.
Yeah.

1322
01:14:26,770 --> 01:14:30,730
Especially the 17 year old kids at creep
because they'll just decide that the 14

1323
01:14:30,731 --> 01:14:34,180
year old has to do shit, you
know, and then force him to
do it and beat their ass.

1324
01:14:34,181 --> 01:14:37,540
It's like, because finally they get
to tell other people what to do.

1325
01:14:37,570 --> 01:14:41,080
Like for 17 years their
parents are probably been
telling them what to do and if

1326
01:14:41,081 --> 01:14:44,100
they grow up in an abusive household,
you know like salt.

1327
01:14:44,130 --> 01:14:46,840
So many bullies that I
met when I was a kid.

1328
01:14:46,841 --> 01:14:50,200
It turned out like when you went
to their house you realize, oh,

1329
01:14:50,590 --> 01:14:55,150
this guy gets bullied at home and then
he goes and bullies people at school.

1330
01:14:55,290 --> 01:14:58,380
Yeah, of course. I think, I think
parenting has a lot to do with it.

1331
01:14:58,381 --> 01:15:00,690
The way that people are raised
has a lot to do with it.

1332
01:15:00,810 --> 01:15:03,210
I had a friend, these are getting
in fist fights with his dad,

1333
01:15:03,720 --> 01:15:06,330
fist fights and he would,
this fucking guy,

1334
01:15:06,510 --> 01:15:09,330
I won't say his name because he's
a good dude. He's not a bad guy.

1335
01:15:09,331 --> 01:15:11,880
I grew up with him and
he would fight anybody.

1336
01:15:12,060 --> 01:15:15,210
Me and my friend Jimmy would go with
this guy and we would have, he goes,

1337
01:15:15,211 --> 01:15:17,070
that's it. We're fighting
tonight. And I'm like,

1338
01:15:17,071 --> 01:15:19,050
we're fighting tonight because
we're fucking fighting.

1339
01:15:19,170 --> 01:15:20,610
And he would just find some money,

1340
01:15:20,611 --> 01:15:24,060
like come on mother fucker and there's
fine the guy and start a fight with them.

1341
01:15:24,240 --> 01:15:25,890
And I've never met anybody like this.

1342
01:15:26,040 --> 01:15:30,570
This guy just would just literally for no
reason go find a person to go. Come on,

1343
01:15:30,580 --> 01:15:32,760
motherfucker were fighting
and he would talk about it.

1344
01:15:32,761 --> 01:15:35,960
Like he had a good one too. He had a
good left, right? That was like his,

1345
01:15:35,970 --> 01:15:38,790
he's wasn't really a very good
fighter who's half decent.

1346
01:15:38,850 --> 01:15:40,650
So it wasn't like he was
even winning these fights.

1347
01:15:40,860 --> 01:15:43,830
Like a lot of times he'd get in fights
and get his ass kicked. But he had,

1348
01:15:43,890 --> 01:15:45,150
he had a pretty decent one too,

1349
01:15:45,300 --> 01:15:47,630
but this fucking guy would
just start fights for it.

1350
01:15:47,631 --> 01:15:50,550
And then I went to his house and
then I got, became friends with them.

1351
01:15:51,000 --> 01:15:52,350
He was friends with my friend Steve.

1352
01:15:52,530 --> 01:15:56,160
And when I became friends we hung
around and I realize like, oh,

1353
01:15:56,161 --> 01:15:58,530
this guy got fucking abused.

1354
01:15:58,860 --> 01:16:01,260
Like he got beat up all
the time like he was,

1355
01:16:01,590 --> 01:16:05,370
he would get in like fist fights with
his dad when he was young, you know,

1356
01:16:05,371 --> 01:16:08,430
like young, you know [inaudible]
his dad would punch him, you know,

1357
01:16:08,431 --> 01:16:11,400
it was like scary shit.
So when you,

1358
01:16:11,430 --> 01:16:16,290
when you meet like the monster
behind the curtain and you go, oh,

1359
01:16:16,291 --> 01:16:19,080
this isn't so cute anymore.
Isn't it so funny?

1360
01:16:19,080 --> 01:16:20,430
Now I know why this guy is doing this.
He's,

1361
01:16:20,431 --> 01:16:22,440
he's an asshole because
he's getting bullied.

1362
01:16:22,570 --> 01:16:24,720
Because like when I became friends
with like, we never had a fight.

1363
01:16:24,721 --> 01:16:25,740
We never even had an argument.

1364
01:16:26,380 --> 01:16:29,820
We were really friendly with each other
and for whatever reason it was like he

1365
01:16:29,821 --> 01:16:33,090
just would find people that he
wanted to fight and it was just an,

1366
01:16:33,091 --> 01:16:35,190
I couldn't understand it. I was like,
why would anybody want to do that?

1367
01:16:35,580 --> 01:16:38,610
Until I realized like, oh, this dude
is like fighting his dad all the time.

1368
01:16:38,670 --> 01:16:41,550
He's probably fighting his
dad every day. Damn. Okay.

1369
01:16:41,700 --> 01:16:46,350
Yes. That's some crazy shit. Shit. Roll
the dice is what it is really is. I mean,

1370
01:16:46,410 --> 01:16:50,760
I think about every once in a while I get
kind of down about certain things like,

1371
01:16:50,790 --> 01:16:55,630
ah, am I fulfilled at work? Am I happy?
Like, oh, I could be doing better, not,

1372
01:16:55,900 --> 01:16:56,840
and then I think about it,

1373
01:16:56,920 --> 01:16:58,480
people problem

1374
01:16:58,610 --> 01:17:03,200
100%. Right? Like I've been giving, I
haven't been giving Christian a hard time,

1375
01:17:03,201 --> 01:17:06,920
but like every once in a while I'll
come home and I'm like in a bad mood and

1376
01:17:06,921 --> 01:17:10,520
he's like, what's wrong? And, uh, my,
my problems, such bullshit problems,

1377
01:17:10,520 --> 01:17:13,100
you know what I mean?
I have great parents.

1378
01:17:13,160 --> 01:17:17,930
I was able to get a good education with
no debt. Like, I have a job that I love.

1379
01:17:17,931 --> 01:17:20,930
Like I have friends that I love.
Everything's great.

1380
01:17:20,931 --> 01:17:24,140
So like when I tried to put things in
perspective and stories like that really

1381
01:17:24,141 --> 01:17:27,770
do put things in perspective
for me, people who don't
have like a home to go to,

1382
01:17:27,771 --> 01:17:29,090
people who don't have good parents,

1383
01:17:29,091 --> 01:17:33,800
like there's a lot of pain and suffering
out there. You know, I remember, um,

1384
01:17:34,610 --> 01:17:38,900
I don't think I told you about this, but,
um, we had gone to San Diego and I tried,

1385
01:17:38,930 --> 01:17:39,763
um,

1386
01:17:39,860 --> 01:17:44,200
mushrooms and for the first time and uh,

1387
01:17:44,240 --> 01:17:45,500
it's like a good,

1388
01:17:45,530 --> 01:17:50,480
it's a good way of kind of like
putting things into perspective, right?

1389
01:17:50,481 --> 01:17:53,840
Because I felt euphoric. Everything
was great. I had a really,

1390
01:17:53,841 --> 01:17:55,070
really good experience with it.

1391
01:17:55,340 --> 01:17:58,880
But there was one point when we were like
walking down the street and there was

1392
01:17:58,881 --> 01:18:03,530
this one elderly homeless man just
walking and he's like stumbling,

1393
01:18:03,531 --> 01:18:07,790
like he can barely walk. Right.
And like, that hit me really hard.

1394
01:18:07,791 --> 01:18:12,500
Like this man has such a bad life. Like
he's out on the streets, he's elderly,

1395
01:18:12,501 --> 01:18:14,510
he's older than my dad,
you know,

1396
01:18:14,511 --> 01:18:18,250
and I think about my dad and he's like
getting up there and like, you know, I,

1397
01:18:18,950 --> 01:18:22,160
his body's kind of starting to break
down a little bit and I'm like, man,

1398
01:18:22,161 --> 01:18:25,730
this guy, I mean, he has no family.
He has no one looking out for him.

1399
01:18:26,120 --> 01:18:29,030
He's out here on the streets and
like, I don't know, like it really,

1400
01:18:29,031 --> 01:18:32,510
really hit me and it put everything
in my life in perspective.

1401
01:18:32,511 --> 01:18:34,250
Like how freaking lucky I am.

1402
01:18:34,520 --> 01:18:36,530
Yeah. It's interesting
that, isn't it funny, it's,

1403
01:18:36,531 --> 01:18:41,531
it's kind of says something about people
that it's very in very poor taste to

1404
01:18:42,651 --> 01:18:47,240
make fun of poor people unless they're
so poor they don't have a home and then

1405
01:18:47,241 --> 01:18:50,180
they're open targets. Yeah.
You know what I'm saying?

1406
01:18:50,270 --> 01:18:54,830
Like as far as the way people mock people,
like people will mock homeless people.

1407
01:18:54,990 --> 01:18:57,710
Like it's a really common thing to
talk about homeless people on stage,

1408
01:18:58,160 --> 01:19:00,350
but if you talk to yeah, yeah, yeah.

1409
01:19:00,351 --> 01:19:02,960
Jokes about homeless people are very
common cause homeless people are a lot of

1410
01:19:02,961 --> 01:19:05,270
times are crazy. You know,
it's not their fault.

1411
01:19:05,271 --> 01:19:07,430
Like one of the reasons why a lot of these
people are homeless because they have

1412
01:19:07,431 --> 01:19:10,580
mental illness and there are
undiagnosed or they don't have money for

1413
01:19:10,581 --> 01:19:12,280
prescriptions or they
lost their job and they,

1414
01:19:12,650 --> 01:19:16,430
sometimes they are diagnosed. But like
if you're a paranoid schizophrenia,

1415
01:19:16,520 --> 01:19:19,070
like my friends, a social worker
and she has this one client,

1416
01:19:19,071 --> 01:19:21,860
he's this really young, attractive
guy in his twenties. Right.

1417
01:19:22,280 --> 01:19:26,540
And he recently got diagnosed as a
paranoid schizophrenia and he is in such

1418
01:19:26,541 --> 01:19:30,290
denial about his condition that
he will not get any help. Wow.

1419
01:19:30,380 --> 01:19:33,240
And now he's homeless.
He's living in a car. Um,

1420
01:19:33,590 --> 01:19:37,430
it's a devastating story and it's
like he has the reasons family has the

1421
01:19:37,431 --> 01:19:39,860
resources to help him.
He doesn't want the help.

1422
01:19:39,861 --> 01:19:42,700
So what do you do with situations
like that? He's out on the street.

1423
01:19:43,200 --> 01:19:46,920
There's not much you can do. And that's
the reality of mental illness. And that's,

1424
01:19:47,210 --> 01:19:50,430
it's, it's a weird thing
where like you can't make fun.

1425
01:19:50,460 --> 01:19:54,630
No one would make fun of
really poor people, like how
they're poor. But you know,

1426
01:19:54,631 --> 01:19:58,350
you could build like, cause fucking
idiot sleeps under a tree, you know,

1427
01:19:58,351 --> 01:20:01,560
what do you your sleeping bag and
the fucking park, you'd dip shit.

1428
01:20:01,950 --> 01:20:05,910
You don't even have a house really.
Like it could be a point of mockery.

1429
01:20:05,911 --> 01:20:08,340
Like people would walk them and even

1430
01:20:08,400 --> 01:20:09,510
tell him to fuck off.

1431
01:20:09,780 --> 01:20:12,090
Whereas like you would never
do that in a poor neighborhood.

1432
01:20:12,120 --> 01:20:13,080
It's kind of strange.

1433
01:20:13,081 --> 01:20:16,170
It's like if you reach poverty to the
point of where you don't even have a roof

1434
01:20:16,171 --> 01:20:19,110
over your head, you're fair
game. It's weird, right? Yeah.

1435
01:20:19,111 --> 01:20:22,890
We have our own way of demonizing poor
neighborhoods though we demonize them by

1436
01:20:22,891 --> 01:20:26,160
allowing police brutality in those
areas and justifying it by saying,

1437
01:20:26,161 --> 01:20:29,040
well it's a poor area with a lot of
crime so of course the cop can shoot an

1438
01:20:29,041 --> 01:20:33,930
unarmed person and not paying the
consequences for you. What is your take,

1439
01:20:33,931 --> 01:20:38,931
and I was really interested to talk to
you about this on first of all on the

1440
01:20:39,301 --> 01:20:42,300
amount of police brutality
cases that are happening.

1441
01:20:42,330 --> 01:20:45,470
Is it just because people were reporting
them now is because people were

1442
01:20:45,480 --> 01:20:47,820
recording them now or am I just,

1443
01:20:48,060 --> 01:20:51,120
am I just really like only
paying attention to what
gets broadcast in the same

1444
01:20:51,121 --> 01:20:52,230
things were always happening.

1445
01:20:52,920 --> 01:20:56,490
I think that this is probably something
that's been going on for quite some time,

1446
01:20:56,550 --> 01:21:00,270
but now since we have
access to surveillance,

1447
01:21:00,420 --> 01:21:02,360
since people are using their smart phones,

1448
01:21:02,370 --> 01:21:06,570
since communities are starting to like
really be on edge in regard to the

1449
01:21:06,571 --> 01:21:09,690
excessive force, now we're seeing
a lot more coverage about it.

1450
01:21:10,170 --> 01:21:14,370
And I think that there's,
there's now a tipping point,

1451
01:21:14,371 --> 01:21:18,150
and I don't know if it's going to lead
to a new civil rights movement or what

1452
01:21:18,151 --> 01:21:19,320
the outcome will be,

1453
01:21:19,740 --> 01:21:24,000
but regardless of what you think about
Michael Brown or Trayvon Martin or any of

1454
01:21:24,001 --> 01:21:25,650
these other high profile cases,

1455
01:21:26,130 --> 01:21:31,130
I think it's hard to believe that anyone
would watch a video of Eric Garner in

1456
01:21:31,141 --> 01:21:36,141
New York City pleading with the cops who
have put him in a headlock to let him

1457
01:21:37,141 --> 01:21:39,210
go because he can't breathe.
Right.

1458
01:21:39,660 --> 01:21:44,040
And then the cop who kills him doesn't
have to deal any concept or deal with any

1459
01:21:44,041 --> 01:21:47,520
consequences for killing him after
putting him in an unlawful headlock.

1460
01:21:47,550 --> 01:21:52,530
It's against the law as a cop in New York
to put someone in a headlock like that.

1461
01:21:52,531 --> 01:21:55,560
But it didn't matter. He
did it. Eric Gardner dies

1462
01:21:55,910 --> 01:21:59,690
and I don't know. Every time
I watched that video, I'm
like, God, just let them go.

1463
01:21:59,691 --> 01:22:02,660
Let them go. You know the outcome, but
you keep telling yourself, let them go.

1464
01:22:02,661 --> 01:22:05,090
Let them go. Come on. He can't breathe.
He's telling you he can't breathe,

1465
01:22:05,091 --> 01:22:08,120
but they didn't fucking let him go
and he's dead. How is that? Okay.

1466
01:22:08,240 --> 01:22:10,130
How has that kind of excessive force?
Okay,

1467
01:22:10,310 --> 01:22:12,350
and if that's not enough to convince you,

1468
01:22:12,620 --> 01:22:16,760
keep in mind that the cops harassing
him because he was selling untaxed

1469
01:22:16,761 --> 01:22:20,780
cigarettes, loose cigarettes. Are you
fucking kidding me? You're in New York.

1470
01:22:20,900 --> 01:22:24,260
We're talking about Wall Street,
robbing the American people,

1471
01:22:24,261 --> 01:22:27,830
destroying the economy, never paying
any fucking consequences for it,

1472
01:22:28,130 --> 01:22:30,610
and now you're going to go after
this man because he's selling loose

1473
01:22:30,640 --> 01:22:32,410
cigarettes.
It's ridiculous.

1474
01:22:33,110 --> 01:22:37,150
That case was really disturbing to me
because I didn't have any cigarettes on

1475
01:22:37,151 --> 01:22:39,400
him.
He didn't have anything on him.

1476
01:22:39,890 --> 01:22:41,730
No, no. He broke. He broke up a fight.

1477
01:22:41,731 --> 01:22:44,960
Cops were called because he
fucking broke up a fight.

1478
01:22:44,970 --> 01:22:47,880
It's like that story enrages me.
It really does.

1479
01:22:47,881 --> 01:22:51,480
Because even with all of that
evidence of the police wrongdoing,

1480
01:22:51,810 --> 01:22:54,690
grand jury verdict says not,
we're not going to indict the cop.

1481
01:22:54,930 --> 01:22:57,690
And then you have people that
defend that grand jury verdict.

1482
01:22:57,691 --> 01:23:00,480
How do you watch that video and defendant?
Did you actually watch the video?

1483
01:23:00,481 --> 01:23:03,300
Did you look into the story or
did you just decide, oh yeah,

1484
01:23:03,301 --> 01:23:07,030
it's a poor black guy. You
know, black guys are always
trouble, so fuck it, he died.

1485
01:23:07,031 --> 01:23:07,530
Who Cares?

1486
01:23:07,530 --> 01:23:11,430
Well, people have this real problem when
it comes to issues like this where they

1487
01:23:11,431 --> 01:23:14,750
either go all the way to the right or
they go all the way to the left. Yeah.

1488
01:23:14,820 --> 01:23:15,970
And you know the,

1489
01:23:15,980 --> 01:23:20,980
the reality of that situation is that
there was no evidence this guy didn't do

1490
01:23:21,361 --> 01:23:24,150
anything wrong. He was standing there
had he been arrested before. Yeah,

1491
01:23:24,151 --> 01:23:27,000
but so what, what are you saying that
because the guy's been arrested before,

1492
01:23:27,001 --> 01:23:28,740
you're allowed to just
fuck with him forever.

1493
01:23:29,010 --> 01:23:32,430
And if he's selling loose
cigarettes, that's it. That's
what you're worried about.

1494
01:23:32,610 --> 01:23:36,450
Like you're not talking about a guy who's
selling slaves or a guy who's stealing

1495
01:23:36,451 --> 01:23:41,310
cars. You're talking about a guy who's
just avoiding a cigarette tax. I mean,

1496
01:23:41,311 --> 01:23:43,920
it's so bizarre.
It's so bizarre.

1497
01:23:43,921 --> 01:23:47,370
The amount of money you're talking about
is so goddamn minuscule and unimportant

1498
01:23:47,371 --> 01:23:51,330
in the city of fucking trillions of
dollars are flowing in and out of it daily

1499
01:23:51,331 --> 01:23:53,670
and you're getting this kind of headlock.
He was no lazy

1500
01:23:53,980 --> 01:23:56,980
for 50 cents a piece or something
like something. So I mean, yeah,

1501
01:23:57,160 --> 01:23:59,680
but when they started grabbing him,
like they didn't need to grab him.

1502
01:23:59,860 --> 01:24:03,280
He wasn't doing anything. He wasn't going
anywhere. It wasn't running away. Nope.

1503
01:24:03,310 --> 01:24:07,000
They're just grabbing him. And when he was
saying like this, this ends today, look,

1504
01:24:07,001 --> 01:24:09,610
y'all always fucking with me.
This ends today. And you're like,

1505
01:24:10,090 --> 01:24:12,280
he just looked and I was like,
this is so pointless.

1506
01:24:12,310 --> 01:24:16,360
Like shouldn't cop should be worried
about the most important shit first.

1507
01:24:16,361 --> 01:24:19,690
Did you solve all the murders? Did
you find all the stolen cars? Do you,

1508
01:24:19,720 --> 01:24:21,280
did you solve all the burglaries?
Okay,

1509
01:24:21,580 --> 01:24:25,210
let's stop fucking with the
cigarette dude. And let's
just think about that shit.

1510
01:24:25,211 --> 01:24:28,420
Like there's only how many people that
are cops. Yeah. What's the number?

1511
01:24:28,421 --> 01:24:31,270
This has gotta be more crimes and cops.
It's the only thing that makes sense.

1512
01:24:31,420 --> 01:24:33,010
So why the fuck would you
concentrate on this shit?

1513
01:24:33,011 --> 01:24:35,830
There's like how many of you
guys, four or five, you know,

1514
01:24:35,831 --> 01:24:39,130
I know they came because of a fight,
you know, but what do you think?

1515
01:24:39,131 --> 01:24:42,490
They just wanted an extra color because
they got there and decided to arrest

1516
01:24:42,491 --> 01:24:43,210
this guy.

1517
01:24:43,210 --> 01:24:44,080
I don't know it,

1518
01:24:44,530 --> 01:24:48,250
that was one of the more disturbing
stories that we covered because the case

1519
01:24:48,251 --> 01:24:51,340
like Trayvon Martin, you know,
you don't have surveillance.

1520
01:24:51,550 --> 01:24:54,760
A case like Michael Brown,
you don't have video. So it's,

1521
01:24:55,150 --> 01:24:57,250
I can understand even though
I don't agree with them,

1522
01:24:57,251 --> 01:25:01,240
I can understand the doubters, right?
But with a case like Eric Garner,

1523
01:25:01,600 --> 01:25:03,580
the proof is in the pudding.
It's right in front of you.

1524
01:25:03,610 --> 01:25:07,840
You have the video footage and still
there were no consequences for the cops.

1525
01:25:07,841 --> 01:25:09,040
And so,
you know,

1526
01:25:09,070 --> 01:25:14,070
when you have police departments and
police unions criticizing NFL players for

1527
01:25:14,261 --> 01:25:18,820
protesting some of these grand jury
verdicts or protesting some of the actions

1528
01:25:18,821 --> 01:25:23,410
of these police officers, I mean you
gotta wonder like what planet they're on.

1529
01:25:23,440 --> 01:25:27,850
Like you guys got away with
murder. Okay, let it go.

1530
01:25:28,030 --> 01:25:30,220
If people want to protest it,
let it go.

1531
01:25:30,250 --> 01:25:34,420
The worst thing you can do is win and
then go out of your way and tell people

1532
01:25:34,421 --> 01:25:37,090
that you're offended because
they're upset that you won.

1533
01:25:37,230 --> 01:25:41,400
Yeah. What do you, what do you know
the law in terms of what kind of uh,

1534
01:25:41,550 --> 01:25:44,100
like the way you're allowed
to grab someone's neck? Like,

1535
01:25:44,210 --> 01:25:47,660
no, I don't know specifically, but I
know that that head lock was unlawful,

1536
01:25:47,661 --> 01:25:50,090
which is why I don't understand why
there wasn't a grand jury verdict

1537
01:25:50,460 --> 01:25:54,590
because here's the reality. What he's
doing definitely is a choke hold.

1538
01:25:54,760 --> 01:25:58,920
It was hands are together and his hands
are together in some of the pictures and

1539
01:25:58,921 --> 01:26:01,500
some of the pictures he's doing
this where his hands are together.

1540
01:26:01,980 --> 01:26:05,660
Technically it's still a choke
hold if you're using one hand,

1541
01:26:05,930 --> 01:26:09,770
but there's not nearly the same amount
of leverage as when you're using two

1542
01:26:09,771 --> 01:26:13,400
hands. We use to like, this is the real,
like what they call a rear naked choke.

1543
01:26:13,401 --> 01:26:14,780
That's what puts you to
sleep really quickly,

1544
01:26:15,050 --> 01:26:17,090
but you could still put
a guy asleep like this.

1545
01:26:17,270 --> 01:26:19,580
You could put a guy to sleep with a lot
of different ways to grab your hands

1546
01:26:19,610 --> 01:26:23,790
once you're grabbing your
hands. So if he's grabbing
his hands, it's a choke hold.

1547
01:26:23,930 --> 01:26:28,550
But even if it's a choke hold,
he might not necessarily be choking him.

1548
01:26:28,700 --> 01:26:32,000
He might be just holding up and
you're the only one who knows.

1549
01:26:32,000 --> 01:26:32,990
That really is that guy,

1550
01:26:33,050 --> 01:26:36,080
the guy who did it because either he
or people who are watching because you

1551
01:26:36,081 --> 01:26:40,490
either see him really squeezing
down the neck or he's holding on.

1552
01:26:40,550 --> 01:26:42,620
He's got the head in here
and he's trapping it,

1553
01:26:42,621 --> 01:26:45,950
but he's not putting any pressure on
the neck. Both of them are possible,

1554
01:26:46,640 --> 01:26:50,720
but the breathing thing most likely had
to do with this guy being diabetic and

1555
01:26:50,721 --> 01:26:55,000
have a lot of health issues. You know
the choking thing, you know you, you,

1556
01:26:55,001 --> 01:26:59,150
you can cut a guy's ear off,
you know when you're choking him.

1557
01:26:59,240 --> 01:27:01,940
And it is possible because he had his
arm around his neck that was happening.

1558
01:27:02,420 --> 01:27:03,980
But it also could have been possible.

1559
01:27:03,981 --> 01:27:06,650
The guy was just freaking the fuck out
and these guys were on top of him and

1560
01:27:06,651 --> 01:27:07,760
he's having a heart attack.

1561
01:27:07,761 --> 01:27:11,780
And either way it was caused
by these guys fucking with him.

1562
01:27:11,870 --> 01:27:15,740
So even if their intention
was not to choke this guy out,

1563
01:27:15,800 --> 01:27:17,270
even if they grabbed him by the neck,

1564
01:27:17,580 --> 01:27:20,520
what you did kill the guy
like for no fucking real,

1565
01:27:20,740 --> 01:27:23,710
here's what you should do when
someone tells you I can't breathe,

1566
01:27:24,040 --> 01:27:25,220
let off him get off.

1567
01:27:25,300 --> 01:27:28,050
But you can't do that
with Psychos, right? No,

1568
01:27:28,060 --> 01:27:30,200
you can't let psychos play you say if you,
if you're,

1569
01:27:30,210 --> 01:27:32,770
if you're a cop in New York City and
you've got some guy who's like, uh,

1570
01:27:33,100 --> 01:27:37,300
you know some football player that's
running a muck and you, you handcuff him,

1571
01:27:37,301 --> 01:27:39,390
you're finally drag them to the
rouser who can't breathe, can't Gabby,

1572
01:27:39,550 --> 01:27:42,940
you let him up. But he fucking head
butts you and runs through the casino.

1573
01:27:42,970 --> 01:27:44,590
You know what I mean?
Like that can happen.

1574
01:27:44,591 --> 01:27:46,520
Like you can't really listen to everybody.
This is a camp,

1575
01:27:46,800 --> 01:27:47,820
right?
But look,

1576
01:27:48,430 --> 01:27:52,260
I have no doubt in my mind that the cops
in that incident knew that Eric Garner

1577
01:27:52,261 --> 01:27:54,660
is not a psycho. Okay. I think that they,

1578
01:27:54,710 --> 01:27:57,180
that's why they're willing to
engage with them physically,

1579
01:27:57,390 --> 01:27:59,820
even though he's a big giant dude.
They knew he was a teddy bear.

1580
01:28:00,360 --> 01:28:02,520
I don't know what I'm saying.
Like they knew they got away with it.

1581
01:28:02,550 --> 01:28:03,930
Did you notice in the
beginning of the video,

1582
01:28:03,931 --> 01:28:05,340
the cop who put him in the choke hold,

1583
01:28:05,341 --> 01:28:08,130
like waited for backup before
he attacked Eric Gardner?

1584
01:28:08,460 --> 01:28:10,860
So it was like he had it in the back
of his mind like, yeah, I'm gonna,

1585
01:28:10,980 --> 01:28:12,630
I'm gonna do what I'm going to do.

1586
01:28:12,631 --> 01:28:15,000
I'm just going to make weight and
make sure that I have backup for it.

1587
01:28:15,150 --> 01:28:18,360
It's just such a sick video. I mean, for
all the listeners who haven't seen it,

1588
01:28:18,361 --> 01:28:22,500
please, please take a
look at it because make

1589
01:28:22,500 --> 01:28:23,041
any sense.

1590
01:28:23,041 --> 01:28:27,110
Because I think that there's a lot of
people that join the police force that

1591
01:28:27,111 --> 01:28:29,820
have great intentions.
And I think that when,

1592
01:28:29,880 --> 01:28:33,780
when when you get into situations
where people have what is really pretty

1593
01:28:33,781 --> 01:28:38,280
basically ultimate power over other
people, it becomes fucking tricky as hell.

1594
01:28:38,310 --> 01:28:40,140
Cause people like to abuse power.
They do,

1595
01:28:40,141 --> 01:28:43,110
they get into that sort of a position
and they just take advantage of it and

1596
01:28:43,111 --> 01:28:46,230
they do things that they can
justify but aren't morally right.

1597
01:28:46,650 --> 01:28:50,250
And this is one of them. It's like
this is not serving or protecting.

1598
01:28:50,460 --> 01:28:53,700
What are you guys,
the body guard of the tax collectors is,

1599
01:28:53,701 --> 01:28:54,630
that's what the fuck you're doing.

1600
01:28:54,770 --> 01:28:58,730
Are we professional leg breakers who are
paid for by the citizens of the United

1601
01:28:58,730 --> 01:29:02,430
States? No, you guys are cops. You know,
in the best of the word, you're loyal

1602
01:29:02,580 --> 01:29:07,080
and fantastic and a great asset to the
community and a very important aspect of

1603
01:29:07,081 --> 01:29:11,580
the community when it comes to keeping
peace and PR, you know, and promoting uh,

1604
01:29:11,640 --> 01:29:15,000
like a, a sense of, of
protection. You know,

1605
01:29:15,090 --> 01:29:19,590
I have to say though is don't you find
it a little ironic that the NYP d,

1606
01:29:19,740 --> 01:29:24,740
the same police force that killed Eric
Garner for selling untaxed cigarettes was

1607
01:29:24,961 --> 01:29:29,961
also the same Nyp d that went after
occupy protesters that were protesting

1608
01:29:30,001 --> 01:29:33,780
against what Wall Street
did to our economy. How many
people were there though?

1609
01:29:33,781 --> 01:29:34,980
How many,
how many,

1610
01:29:35,210 --> 01:29:38,400
like how many people were involved
in the occupy Wall Street thing?

1611
01:29:38,401 --> 01:29:41,610
Did they just send the cops out there
and just have them start arresting kids

1612
01:29:41,830 --> 01:29:42,240
work?

1613
01:29:42,240 --> 01:29:47,240
What I found really interesting is JP
Morgan Chase had donated a huge amount of

1614
01:29:49,201 --> 01:29:50,034
money,

1615
01:29:50,490 --> 01:29:55,200
millions of dollars to the NYP d as The
occupy protest started to get really

1616
01:29:55,201 --> 01:29:58,440
fired up. And so look, money talks, right?

1617
01:29:58,890 --> 01:30:03,420
Wall Street bankers and the people that
did what they did to our economy in 2008

1618
01:30:04,050 --> 01:30:07,980
have money and power.
And so if you have 4.6 million,

1619
01:30:08,600 --> 01:30:12,480
if you have blatant, you have that kind
of money, then you by the police force,

1620
01:30:12,510 --> 01:30:16,650
they're going to look out for you. Okay,
so when do cops really care about taxes?

1621
01:30:16,980 --> 01:30:20,220
They care about taxes. When the
powerless aren't paying their taxes.

1622
01:30:20,460 --> 01:30:24,600
How rude is that though? 4.6
million. That is so goddamn blatant.

1623
01:30:24,690 --> 01:30:28,440
I mean it is. I remember, I remember
what had happened. I was like, really?

1624
01:30:28,441 --> 01:30:29,820
You guys are so transparent.

1625
01:30:29,821 --> 01:30:32,790
I mean I got to respect the fact that
you guys are that transparent about it.

1626
01:30:32,791 --> 01:30:35,490
Right? I respect that.
That's gangster as fuck.

1627
01:30:35,690 --> 01:30:39,170
Just laid out a four point
$6 million cheque. Listen,

1628
01:30:39,180 --> 01:30:42,830
I would like to build my bends
into the garage and peace.

1629
01:30:43,940 --> 01:30:45,990
You got a big fat cigar was talking to,

1630
01:30:46,440 --> 01:30:49,380
I think we could work something out and
you guys need new helmets or some shit.

1631
01:30:50,070 --> 01:30:53,970
It's the world we live in, man.
Four point $6 million is like,

1632
01:30:54,150 --> 01:30:56,580
that's like saying, you know, look,

1633
01:30:56,730 --> 01:31:00,480
we have so much fucking
money that these hippies,

1634
01:31:00,750 --> 01:31:04,410
I'm willing to pay 4.6 million just
cleaned this bitch up and they did.

1635
01:31:04,650 --> 01:31:08,100
Is it done? There's a, if you go by
there, is there anybody was the square?

1636
01:31:08,340 --> 01:31:11,670
Do you know what the square was where
it was Connie, that's what it is.

1637
01:31:11,910 --> 01:31:13,020
Is there anybody there anymore?

1638
01:31:13,590 --> 01:31:16,410
I don't know if there are occupy
protesters there now, but I mean,

1639
01:31:16,411 --> 01:31:21,030
I think it's safe to say at this point
that the occupy movement has died down

1640
01:31:21,210 --> 01:31:25,770
considerably. So, which sucks because
I mean, I was very supportive of it.

1641
01:31:25,771 --> 01:31:26,670
I was behind it.

1642
01:31:26,671 --> 01:31:30,210
I really wanted to keep it alive at the
same time that the banks were doing what

1643
01:31:30,211 --> 01:31:32,880
they could to shut it down.
You also had the mainstream media,

1644
01:31:32,881 --> 01:31:37,350
which is bought by corporations
also doing its best to discredit it,

1645
01:31:37,351 --> 01:31:41,840
be little it. And so you have like
people watching the news thinking,

1646
01:31:42,150 --> 01:31:45,800
oh, CNN and Fox News
like this is, you know,

1647
01:31:45,810 --> 01:31:49,740
this is a reliable news source thinking
that these occupy protestors or all

1648
01:31:49,741 --> 01:31:54,720
these crazy druggies that are living on
the streets and they're causing riots

1649
01:31:54,721 --> 01:31:55,920
and there looting and this,

1650
01:31:55,921 --> 01:31:58,620
and I mean kind of similar to what
happened with Ferguson protesters,

1651
01:31:58,860 --> 01:32:00,190
all of them were painted

1652
01:32:00,190 --> 01:32:02,080
as looters in the mainstream press.
Within.

1653
01:32:02,081 --> 01:32:07,000
The reality is you have a few crazy
people that might coopt something, right?

1654
01:32:07,001 --> 01:32:11,770
That might cause some trouble, but that's
not indicative of all the protesters.

1655
01:32:12,100 --> 01:32:15,550
You know? That's not something that
you're going to see with all of them.

1656
01:32:15,551 --> 01:32:18,970
It's just like a tiny fringe that
might be causing some trouble.

1657
01:32:18,971 --> 01:32:20,740
But it's interesting that
the mainstream press,

1658
01:32:20,741 --> 01:32:24,310
we'll focus on those as opposed to the
people who actually have an important

1659
01:32:24,311 --> 01:32:25,990
message that they're trying to get out.

1660
01:32:26,700 --> 01:32:30,290
I think they just focus on what they
think people are gonna Watch who you're

1661
01:32:30,291 --> 01:32:34,530
going to watch. This is the blog and off
the highway, which is by the way you, you,

1662
01:32:34,531 --> 01:32:38,520
you guys who are protesting the police,
I get what you're doing.

1663
01:32:38,521 --> 01:32:39,660
It's very noble.

1664
01:32:39,690 --> 01:32:43,860
There's a lot of like a lot of people
with a lot of really good ideas and a lot

1665
01:32:43,861 --> 01:32:47,130
of really positive energy and they, they,
they really want to make some change.

1666
01:32:47,490 --> 01:32:51,000
But I just think there's a lot of real
problems and parking off the highway and

1667
01:32:51,001 --> 01:32:52,350
one of them is medical care.

1668
01:32:52,650 --> 01:32:56,400
People that are sick or people that are
injured for loved ones to lose loved

1669
01:32:56,401 --> 01:33:00,300
ones because the highways are blocked off
in the ambulance couldn't get through.

1670
01:33:00,301 --> 01:33:05,301
It would be so horrific
and tragic compounding and
already horrific and tragic

1671
01:33:06,750 --> 01:33:09,060
situation.
And I don't think it's necessary.

1672
01:33:09,300 --> 01:33:14,300
I think there's gotta be a way where you
can allow traffic where regular folks

1673
01:33:14,430 --> 01:33:18,780
who probably most of them agree
that police violence is out of hand.

1674
01:33:19,050 --> 01:33:24,050
The you shouldn't be just blocking
off highways because you can run into

1675
01:33:24,211 --> 01:33:29,211
situations where you cost people
their lives and you cost loved ones.

1676
01:33:29,880 --> 01:33:34,710
Loved ones are in horrific grief because
this person didn't get to the doctor

1677
01:33:34,711 --> 01:33:38,550
and time and bled out because the
fucking highway was completely shut down

1678
01:33:38,700 --> 01:33:42,090
because some white kids wanting
to show how down they were.

1679
01:33:42,130 --> 01:33:44,610
They weren't a get arrested
and put zip ties on me, bitch.

1680
01:33:44,611 --> 01:33:46,320
I'm going to fucking snapchat this.

1681
01:33:46,560 --> 01:33:49,410
I'm going to Instagram these pictures
from the back of this patty wagon.

1682
01:33:49,411 --> 01:33:54,270
I'm so down, I'm so down. We're going to
block off the highway. Fuck capitalism.

1683
01:33:54,520 --> 01:33:59,520
You know there's a lot of like strong
wills and good intentions and people that

1684
01:33:59,791 --> 01:34:02,280
really want the world to
be better than it is today.

1685
01:34:02,520 --> 01:34:04,350
That's the motivation behind it all,

1686
01:34:04,730 --> 01:34:09,730
but it is very prob problematic when
you do things like stop fellow citizens

1687
01:34:11,220 --> 01:34:16,220
from getting places and using traffic
systems and using that just gets weird

1688
01:34:17,221 --> 01:34:20,580
man. You don't know what you're,
you're fucking up and if you did,

1689
01:34:20,880 --> 01:34:23,010
you would fucking hate yourself.

1690
01:34:23,011 --> 01:34:25,860
You can't and you can't
blame it on anybody else. You
can't blame it on the cops.

1691
01:34:26,040 --> 01:34:28,920
You can't blame it on Ferguson.
You can't blame it on the president.

1692
01:34:29,160 --> 01:34:33,300
If you are blocking the highway
and someone dies because of that,

1693
01:34:33,301 --> 01:34:35,880
you have to blame yourself.
You don't need it in your life.

1694
01:34:36,030 --> 01:34:37,410
There's other ways to protest.

1695
01:34:37,500 --> 01:34:40,620
Yeah. No, I agree with you
about blocking roadways,

1696
01:34:40,621 --> 01:34:45,621
but there also is a very delicate balance
because the reality is protests and

1697
01:34:46,170 --> 01:34:50,340
political activism is not meant to be
convenient and when it is convenient,

1698
01:34:50,341 --> 01:34:53,700
then you don't get heard.
So sometimes you do have to stir the pot.

1699
01:34:53,701 --> 01:34:56,420
Sometimes there needs to be
civil disobedience. Right. Uli,

1700
01:34:56,420 --> 01:34:58,010
do you think there's a
to do it without blocking

1701
01:34:58,010 --> 01:35:00,390
the highway or definitely.
I'm sure. I'm sure there is.

1702
01:35:00,391 --> 01:35:01,230
I think it's about white hat

1703
01:35:01,290 --> 01:35:03,040
though. What about the city
hall? Sorry to interrupt you,

1704
01:35:03,041 --> 01:35:06,040
but what about their city hall? Why
don't they just swarm that? I'm sure.

1705
01:35:06,041 --> 01:35:07,030
I'm sure that they did.

1706
01:35:07,220 --> 01:35:12,110
I'm sure that they did, but I
don't, I don't know if that's
enough. Really. Um, look,

1707
01:35:12,560 --> 01:35:17,560
nothing bothers people in authority more
than having protesters that are causing

1708
01:35:18,441 --> 01:35:20,060
a Ruckus.
And by rock is,

1709
01:35:20,061 --> 01:35:23,900
I don't mean breaking into
innocent businesses and
looting and doing crazy shit

1710
01:35:23,901 --> 01:35:28,310
like that, but there needs to be civil
disobedience right. At a protest,

1711
01:35:28,730 --> 01:35:32,330
like the way that protests are supposed
to go down legally as ridiculous.

1712
01:35:32,331 --> 01:35:35,540
Like you got to get the right permits
for it and you gotta be in the protest

1713
01:35:35,541 --> 01:35:39,200
zone and you, but like the
Burritos, like yeah, let's,

1714
01:35:39,201 --> 01:35:42,440
let's put all the protesters in a corner
and ignore them as they're holding

1715
01:35:42,441 --> 01:35:45,460
their signs. No, protests are
supposed to be inconvenient.

1716
01:35:45,470 --> 01:35:49,700
They're supposed to get
people's attention. It's
supposed to fire people up.

1717
01:35:49,900 --> 01:35:50,830
What about this idea?

1718
01:35:51,100 --> 01:35:56,080
What about going to city hall and having
so many people show up that you block

1719
01:35:56,081 --> 01:35:59,440
the entrances to all the buildings?
I mean,

1720
01:35:59,441 --> 01:36:02,380
I'm don't let anybody in you just say,
look to you guys are broken.

1721
01:36:02,381 --> 01:36:04,900
This thing's broken. We're not letting
you in. Get the fuck out of here.

1722
01:36:05,020 --> 01:36:05,651
It's everybody locks.

1723
01:36:05,651 --> 01:36:08,020
And so if you want to get
arrested for blocking the highway,

1724
01:36:08,230 --> 01:36:12,010
how about you blocked the real
issue, the real problem, the real,

1725
01:36:12,040 --> 01:36:15,340
the real source of government.
And if you did that,

1726
01:36:15,960 --> 01:36:19,600
I might be like terrorist
act of suggesting this I
should probably say is don't

1727
01:36:19,601 --> 01:36:23,080
do this. I mean, everything's considered,
it's whatever I'm saying. Don't listen.

1728
01:36:23,260 --> 01:36:27,340
I know I'm the fear factor host. I'm not
to be taken seriously. Don't do that.

1729
01:36:27,341 --> 01:36:30,820
Don't block city hall but, but don't
block the fucking highway. What? I mean,

1730
01:36:30,880 --> 01:36:31,750
there's gotta be a way.

1731
01:36:32,270 --> 01:36:34,430
Sure there is. And I'm not, you know,

1732
01:36:34,431 --> 01:36:37,730
I'm not good at organizing
these types of events, but,

1733
01:36:38,200 --> 01:36:41,420
but I think you do make a really good
point about blocking roadways and things

1734
01:36:41,421 --> 01:36:43,970
like that. There was a question
I wanted to ask you though.

1735
01:36:43,971 --> 01:36:47,720
I'm really curious if you've ever had to
deal with any type of police brutality

1736
01:36:47,721 --> 01:36:48,554
as a dude.

1737
01:36:49,130 --> 01:36:51,860
No. No. Fortunately, no. I've seen it.

1738
01:36:52,310 --> 01:36:55,820
I've seen cops beat the fuck out of
people. Really? Yeah, yeah, I've seen.

1739
01:36:55,821 --> 01:36:59,060
But you know, a lot of times it's drunk
assholes and the cops are, you know,

1740
01:36:59,061 --> 01:37:01,580
having to protect themselves. I've
seen that too. You know, I've,

1741
01:37:01,700 --> 01:37:05,550
I've known a lot of police officers over
the course of my life because my, uh,

1742
01:37:05,720 --> 01:37:09,680
dad was a cop and then, uh,
growing up doing martial arts,

1743
01:37:09,681 --> 01:37:11,570
I knew a lot of dudes that were cops.

1744
01:37:11,571 --> 01:37:15,920
Like from the time I was 14,
15 years old,

1745
01:37:15,921 --> 01:37:20,480
I was around cops all the time.
And so, um, I'm just, um, you know,

1746
01:37:21,190 --> 01:37:25,760
they, for the most part, I don't look
dangerous. I don't look like a suspect.

1747
01:37:25,761 --> 01:37:29,090
And now to this day, now it's easy
because most of them are UFC fans.

1748
01:37:29,091 --> 01:37:31,130
Like cops want to learn how
to defend themselves, right?

1749
01:37:31,131 --> 01:37:34,160
So I usually just talk to them and
everything's cool. I'm respectful.

1750
01:37:34,370 --> 01:37:36,990
But when I was a kid,
I wasn't the one that you'd worry about.

1751
01:37:37,010 --> 01:37:39,890
Not a big black guy, you know, I'm
a little white guy, so it's like,

1752
01:37:40,220 --> 01:37:43,940
if I was polite, no sir, give
him my license. Registration.
I never had a problem.

1753
01:37:44,300 --> 01:37:46,160
But people you know,

1754
01:37:46,161 --> 01:37:50,390
in the worst situation can
react in the worst way.

1755
01:37:50,660 --> 01:37:52,370
And that includes cops. I mean, who,

1756
01:37:52,371 --> 01:37:56,220
you don't know what the fuck that cop
had to do before he got to you that day.

1757
01:37:56,530 --> 01:38:00,780
He could have been in some sort of crazy
situation where someone's trying to run

1758
01:38:00,781 --> 01:38:04,740
him over with a car and he pulls out
a meth head off an old lady or just

1759
01:38:04,950 --> 01:38:05,910
ultimate chaos.

1760
01:38:05,911 --> 01:38:09,090
He could've gone to a domestic violence
situation where you saw somebody get

1761
01:38:09,091 --> 01:38:11,460
shot, you know, by the
time a cop gets to you,

1762
01:38:11,461 --> 01:38:16,110
who the fuck knows what he
saw right before you or just
in the years before you.

1763
01:38:16,130 --> 01:38:20,520
Yeah. So they could be really high
strung and yeah. You know, and I, I,

1764
01:38:20,850 --> 01:38:23,550
I think that some people
don't recognize that.

1765
01:38:23,760 --> 01:38:28,710
And I also think that the idea of being
a cop is probably ridiculous and almost

1766
01:38:28,711 --> 01:38:30,780
no one's qualified to
do it for a long time.

1767
01:38:30,930 --> 01:38:34,380
Cause I think the amount of stress that
they see or they experienced in the

1768
01:38:34,381 --> 01:38:37,550
amount of violence that they
see is almost, you know, it's,

1769
01:38:37,960 --> 01:38:39,300
it's in a lot of ways it's,

1770
01:38:39,360 --> 01:38:42,510
it's crazy than being a soldier because
some of these guys are putting in 25

1771
01:38:42,511 --> 01:38:43,260
years,

1772
01:38:43,260 --> 01:38:45,660
I can't imagine it.
I really can't.

1773
01:38:45,720 --> 01:38:48,570
Some of them are seeing all kinds of
crazy shit for year after year after year.

1774
01:38:48,571 --> 01:38:52,560
It's like that becomes their reality. It
changes like who they are. I've never,

1775
01:38:52,561 --> 01:38:55,020
I mean I've never seen
a dead body in my life,

1776
01:38:55,050 --> 01:38:57,270
but cops see that kind of
stuff on a regular basis.

1777
01:38:57,271 --> 01:39:00,960
So I don't want to discredit cops out
there that are doing good work and I know

1778
01:39:00,961 --> 01:39:01,651
they exist.

1779
01:39:01,651 --> 01:39:04,650
But I think it's also important for
them to speak out against the police

1780
01:39:04,651 --> 01:39:05,850
brutality that they see.

1781
01:39:06,120 --> 01:39:11,120
I think a lot of the reason why people
are kind of opposed to police in general

1782
01:39:12,151 --> 01:39:15,540
is because the good cops are usually very
reluctant to speak out against the bad

1783
01:39:15,541 --> 01:39:17,760
cops and they protect one another.

1784
01:39:17,790 --> 01:39:20,850
And so I think it's important for the
good cops to speak out against them

1785
01:39:20,851 --> 01:39:23,910
because the bad cops are the
ones that are really, you know,

1786
01:39:23,911 --> 01:39:28,710
muddying the waters and um,
tainting the entire police force.

1787
01:39:28,740 --> 01:39:29,520
You're right.

1788
01:39:29,520 --> 01:39:34,520
And I think there's a really accurate
representation of what a bad cop really is

1789
01:39:34,950 --> 01:39:38,700
when you just look at it. Don Imus
posters on the Internet. I think that,

1790
01:39:38,910 --> 01:39:40,440
and you get a number of people,

1791
01:39:40,441 --> 01:39:43,860
I don't know how many cops there are that
are professional police officers today

1792
01:39:43,861 --> 01:39:47,160
in the United States of America,
but just whatever that number is,

1793
01:39:47,760 --> 01:39:50,670
if 2% of them are fucking douchebags,

1794
01:39:50,820 --> 01:39:54,900
which is really likely when you take a
hundred regular people just a hundred,

1795
01:39:55,320 --> 01:39:59,640
the odds of you having to is
pretty good. It's probably 70, 80%.

1796
01:39:59,641 --> 01:40:03,120
The odds of you having one douche bag
out of a hundred people's a 100% so it's

1797
01:40:03,121 --> 01:40:07,350
at least 1% douche bag and every
hundred unless you're in like boulder or

1798
01:40:07,351 --> 01:40:09,090
something where sue people
are just super sweet.

1799
01:40:09,330 --> 01:40:10,890
Unless you're in some weird place,

1800
01:40:11,490 --> 01:40:14,640
you're going to have like one out of
a hundred people that are douche bags.

1801
01:40:14,760 --> 01:40:16,710
That's going to be the case
with police officers as well.

1802
01:40:16,860 --> 01:40:20,100
So if you look at Internet comments like
especially like how many people tell

1803
01:40:20,101 --> 01:40:21,570
you to sit on their
face and shit like that.

1804
01:40:21,810 --> 01:40:23,370
Look at all the assholes
that are out there,

1805
01:40:23,490 --> 01:40:26,610
but then compare it to the amount
of people that are out there.

1806
01:40:26,940 --> 01:40:31,940
They're dealing with some insanely
incomprehensible number of people that are

1807
01:40:32,311 --> 01:40:35,340
online right now. So for hundreds
of millions just in this country,

1808
01:40:35,341 --> 01:40:39,060
just throwing information back and forth
in the shitty stuff gets through the

1809
01:40:39,061 --> 01:40:41,970
net and it hits you and you're
like, people fucking suck. No,

1810
01:40:41,971 --> 01:40:43,680
most people are awesome.

1811
01:40:44,010 --> 01:40:48,510
The vast majority of people are great.
The vast majority,

1812
01:40:48,690 --> 01:40:53,690
but it's just like one or 2% that
sneak through that fuck the whole thing

1813
01:40:54,010 --> 01:40:57,730
sideways. Yeah, definitely.
There's no question about,
that happens with cops too.

1814
01:40:57,940 --> 01:41:02,050
I think cops are representative of the
general public as a whole. And if you,

1815
01:41:02,051 --> 01:41:07,051
if you looked at only the shitty web
comments and ignored all the people that

1816
01:41:07,121 --> 01:41:11,050
are like posting Facebook posts on
each others walls, you look so awesome.

1817
01:41:11,051 --> 01:41:13,930
I'm so psyched for you. You guys
this shit. I love you to death.

1818
01:41:14,170 --> 01:41:17,980
All that positive shit that people do
back and forth with each other that that's

1819
01:41:17,981 --> 01:41:20,470
like, that counts too. And
we don't focus on that.

1820
01:41:20,471 --> 01:41:23,980
Where it was focusing on these
assholes opened litter too. You know,

1821
01:41:23,990 --> 01:41:28,180
these is shit hoods, right?
The angry things and you
fucking good for the season.

1822
01:41:28,181 --> 01:41:32,830
Huh? You know this asshole's calls,
you're always going to have assholes.

1823
01:41:33,710 --> 01:41:37,420
When I think about like my
Instagram page for instance, right?

1824
01:41:37,450 --> 01:41:39,880
Like I get a lot of love on Instagram.

1825
01:41:39,880 --> 01:41:43,310
Like I very rarely we'll get like a
terrible comment on there and, and I've,

1826
01:41:43,540 --> 01:41:46,390
I love people who follow me on Instagram.
They're super sweet, super nice,

1827
01:41:46,391 --> 01:41:50,050
really respectful. Every once in a while
I'll have to block someone, but it's not,

1828
01:41:50,170 --> 01:41:52,420
it's very rare. Um, so yeah,

1829
01:41:52,421 --> 01:41:55,690
I think I should focus on that as
opposed to like the crazy ass people that

1830
01:41:55,691 --> 01:41:59,920
write terrible things on youtube, which
just the sheer numbers, it's like true.

1831
01:42:00,240 --> 01:42:03,400
We get caught up in a few variables,

1832
01:42:03,430 --> 01:42:05,710
a few people that get that
sneak through the net.

1833
01:42:05,920 --> 01:42:09,170
And I think with cops for we,
we,

1834
01:42:09,220 --> 01:42:11,650
we've already established it's
an insanely difficult job.

1835
01:42:11,680 --> 01:42:14,350
It's really hard for people
to process all the stress.

1836
01:42:14,440 --> 01:42:16,750
It's not something the
average person experiences.

1837
01:42:16,930 --> 01:42:21,370
And it's also therefore not something the
average person can commiserate with or

1838
01:42:21,371 --> 01:42:24,460
understand or even conceptualize.

1839
01:42:24,470 --> 01:42:26,740
If you're not seeing
people shot all the time,

1840
01:42:26,741 --> 01:42:29,710
like you've never seen a body and
you're talking to a guy who works in the

1841
01:42:29,711 --> 01:42:32,670
fucking gang unit like Jesus
Christ, you know, you're,

1842
01:42:32,671 --> 01:42:37,120
you're dealing with two
completely different realities.
And I think there's that.

1843
01:42:37,150 --> 01:42:41,530
And then there's also the 2% thing,
like you get a hundred people, you know,

1844
01:42:41,531 --> 01:42:44,320
there's more than a hundred cops. One
of them's a con. All right, he's just,

1845
01:42:44,360 --> 01:42:47,560
he's an asshole. There's no, it doesn't
mean that all cops aren't like that.

1846
01:42:47,920 --> 01:42:51,430
And the other problem is when you're
around cons and you've got this fucking

1847
01:42:51,431 --> 01:42:54,670
code of silence and you know,
even if it's one con out of a hundred,

1848
01:42:54,671 --> 01:42:57,340
if he's got away with some shit,
you want to get away with some shit too.

1849
01:42:57,460 --> 01:43:00,700
They were all brotherhood and the fucking
badge and that's where bad cops come

1850
01:43:00,701 --> 01:43:01,960
from.
That's where all that,

1851
01:43:02,080 --> 01:43:04,780
there's a lot of them have good intentions
when they get involved and then they

1852
01:43:04,781 --> 01:43:06,310
slowly but surely get corrupted.

1853
01:43:06,470 --> 01:43:11,470
I think it's a culture problem within
police enforcement and it needs to be

1854
01:43:11,651 --> 01:43:12,251
addressed.

1855
01:43:12,251 --> 01:43:15,850
And one way that you can address it is
ensuring that prosecutors and district

1856
01:43:15,851 --> 01:43:20,050
attorneys and other people that are in
the justice system aren't in bed with

1857
01:43:20,051 --> 01:43:23,110
cops. So when they do do
something wrong, you know,

1858
01:43:23,111 --> 01:43:27,910
there are proper consequences, you
know, in response to what they've done.

1859
01:43:28,200 --> 01:43:32,620
Um, but it's interesting because I never
thought for a million years that I would

1860
01:43:32,621 --> 01:43:35,140
ever experience like a bad cop,
you know,

1861
01:43:35,141 --> 01:43:39,280
cause I'm not the demographic that usually
deals with crooked cops. Right? I'm,

1862
01:43:39,670 --> 01:43:42,040
you know, white girl, you know,

1863
01:43:42,070 --> 01:43:46,450
who is driving a nice car
and I am very agreeable,

1864
01:43:46,451 --> 01:43:49,990
very nice with cops. Whenever they pull
me over. I think you're a white crow,

1865
01:43:49,991 --> 01:43:52,220
but if you were trying to date some

1866
01:43:52,220 --> 01:43:55,050
dude who's a white dude
in Wisconsin and you can't

1867
01:43:55,310 --> 01:43:59,750
Armenia. Interesting. That's true.
That's true. Yeah. I'm not, yeah,

1868
01:43:59,751 --> 01:44:03,200
I'm not late earlier white girl.
You're in some weird category.

1869
01:44:05,270 --> 01:44:09,350
Um, but it was funny like
a few weeks ago. Really.

1870
01:44:09,460 --> 01:44:12,850
I mean, it's not a bad thing. I love
Armenians. Armenians are firing people.

1871
01:44:12,851 --> 01:44:15,580
I love our Armenian fighters are some
of the most exciting fighters to watch.

1872
01:44:15,640 --> 01:44:17,920
Yeah, super aggressive.
I don't believe it.

1873
01:44:18,540 --> 01:44:22,900
Breezy and Manny ganbare and some of the
most fun guys to watch animals. Yeah,

1874
01:44:22,901 --> 01:44:25,240
they really are toward
Moosejaw and other Armenian.

1875
01:44:25,241 --> 01:44:28,310
There's a lot of top fighters
that Armenian. I didn't
know that. Oh yeah. Okay.

1876
01:44:28,380 --> 01:44:32,410
A good percentage. Yeah.
That's good to know. Animal.
Yeah. Is quite a few of them.

1877
01:44:32,650 --> 01:44:35,800
Quite a few of them because
they're known for kickboxers too.

1878
01:44:35,860 --> 01:44:38,410
A lot of good Armenian kickboxers.
That's cool. I like that

1879
01:44:38,860 --> 01:44:42,910
to an Armenian sweet 16 right after this.
So I'm looking forward to that.

1880
01:44:42,911 --> 01:44:45,980
We're going to eat it. Don't do any
sparring food. Don't, I won't, I won't,

1881
01:44:45,981 --> 01:44:49,870
I won't just can throw, I won't
mess with them. Um, but yeah,

1882
01:44:49,871 --> 01:44:53,740
like I got pulled over by a cop a few
weeks ago because I did something wrong.

1883
01:44:53,770 --> 01:44:57,940
I made an illegal uturn and I knew like,
I remember right before I did it,

1884
01:44:57,970 --> 01:45:01,270
I had two of my colleagues in the,
in the car with me right before no,

1885
01:45:01,330 --> 01:45:04,270
three of them right before I did it,
I looked around and I was like,

1886
01:45:04,271 --> 01:45:06,310
is there a cop? Is there a
cop? Nope, I'm going to do it.

1887
01:45:06,311 --> 01:45:11,311
So I start doing the u turn and a
cop turns the corner and I was like,

1888
01:45:11,850 --> 01:45:15,610
dammit, okay, whatever. I'm going to get
a ticket. It's fine. I deserve it. Right.

1889
01:45:15,640 --> 01:45:20,640
And I'm not combative or anything
pulls me over before he says,

1890
01:45:20,950 --> 01:45:22,810
do you know why I pulled you over?
Right.

1891
01:45:22,811 --> 01:45:24,700
Which is what they usually say when they,
I believe me,

1892
01:45:24,701 --> 01:45:29,410
I've gotten a lot of tickets. First thing
he says to me is, why are you laughing?

1893
01:45:30,400 --> 01:45:34,480
And I wasn't, I wasn't laughing.
I'm about to get a ticket, right?

1894
01:45:34,510 --> 01:45:37,660
And I don't want to get a ticket.
I just tinted my windows illegally.

1895
01:45:37,690 --> 01:45:41,740
I'm probably gonna get a ticket for that
on the Internet.

1896
01:45:43,280 --> 01:45:47,500
Everything's gonna be fine. Um, and
so I'm, I'm not laughing, right?

1897
01:45:47,501 --> 01:45:50,830
And so I look at him, I'm like, I'm
sorry officer. I'm not laughing.

1898
01:45:50,831 --> 01:45:54,130
If it seems as though I have like
any type of amuse look on my face,

1899
01:45:54,131 --> 01:45:57,850
it might be because I just did something
really stupid and I can't believe I did

1900
01:45:57,851 --> 01:46:00,280
something stupid. And I
really apologize. He's like,

1901
01:46:00,310 --> 01:46:03,250
I can give you four tickets right now.
I'm gonna give you four tickets.

1902
01:46:03,700 --> 01:46:07,120
And I was like, okay. He's like,
yeah. He's like, yeah. He's like,

1903
01:46:07,150 --> 01:46:10,870
do you deserve for tickets?
And I was like, um, if I'm,

1904
01:46:10,900 --> 01:46:13,630
if I did four things wrong,
then I guess I deserve for tickets.

1905
01:46:13,870 --> 01:46:18,010
I was just being so agreeable with him.
Right. I'm like, I'm sorry officer.

1906
01:46:18,011 --> 01:46:22,210
I apologize him like 50,000
times. And then, you know,

1907
01:46:22,211 --> 01:46:26,440
he just like stood there and
yelled at me and then finally, oh,

1908
01:46:26,441 --> 01:46:27,490
and then it wasn't,
you know,

1909
01:46:27,491 --> 01:46:30,520
I had just gotten the car so I
hadn't gotten my license plates yet.

1910
01:46:30,940 --> 01:46:33,760
And he's like, where are your license
plates? And I was like, it's a new car I,

1911
01:46:33,790 --> 01:46:36,730
I haven't gotten before I
could even finish the sentence.
It's like, I don't care.

1912
01:46:37,090 --> 01:46:41,590
Like he was just really mean. And I was
like, Oh, do this guys. Like roid it up.

1913
01:46:41,591 --> 01:46:43,420
I don't know what his issue
is. He's pissed. Right.

1914
01:46:43,420 --> 01:46:46,120
But I'm just going to keep
agreeing with him and let it go.

1915
01:46:46,450 --> 01:46:48,880
The story gets better.
That's just the beginning.

1916
01:46:49,260 --> 01:46:54,260
So then he goes back to his car and gets
his little citation booklet thing and

1917
01:46:54,900 --> 01:46:58,740
he, I don't know what he looks up, maybe
he looks up my identity or whatever.

1918
01:46:59,310 --> 01:47:02,670
And then all of a sudden I hear him
say something and I couldn't hear him

1919
01:47:02,671 --> 01:47:07,140
because it's kind of a busy road. And so
I look at my, my coworkers and I'm like,

1920
01:47:07,200 --> 01:47:09,240
did he say something to me?
They're like, we don't know.

1921
01:47:09,241 --> 01:47:11,700
We didn't hear him right and they were
like spooked out because this guy was

1922
01:47:11,701 --> 01:47:12,570
being such a dick.

1923
01:47:13,110 --> 01:47:16,170
And then he said something again
and I still couldn't hear him.

1924
01:47:16,171 --> 01:47:19,620
So I like poked my head out the window
and I was like, I'm sorry officer,

1925
01:47:19,621 --> 01:47:22,710
I couldn't hear you. Can you please
repeat that? And then he was like,

1926
01:47:22,711 --> 01:47:24,270
I need you to step out of the vehicle.

1927
01:47:24,990 --> 01:47:27,900
And I don't know what it
was about him saying that,

1928
01:47:27,930 --> 01:47:30,990
but I immediately freaked out.
Okay.

1929
01:47:31,440 --> 01:47:34,650
And so like I start tearing up and I'm
trying to hold it back and I'm like,

1930
01:47:34,651 --> 01:47:36,780
why does he want me to get out of
the cars? He going to search it.

1931
01:47:36,781 --> 01:47:40,980
There was nothing in the car,
but I'm like, I did search a car.

1932
01:47:41,850 --> 01:47:43,560
I know have some sort of a warrant.

1933
01:47:43,590 --> 01:47:47,580
And also he needs probable cause to
have me to have me step out of the car.

1934
01:47:47,581 --> 01:47:50,040
There was no reason for him to
have me step out of the car.

1935
01:47:50,100 --> 01:47:54,610
That alone was not a lawful requests.
But anyway, I stepped out of the car,

1936
01:47:54,611 --> 01:47:55,444
I went by him.

1937
01:47:55,800 --> 01:47:59,730
And then I realized very quickly that
this cup is a fucking pervert. Okay.

1938
01:48:00,210 --> 01:48:02,160
And so as I'm crying,

1939
01:48:02,161 --> 01:48:05,820
he's getting a rise out of this and
he starts asking me like a bunch of

1940
01:48:05,821 --> 01:48:09,150
questions, like, why were you using
your phone when you were driving?

1941
01:48:09,750 --> 01:48:12,950
And I was like, my phone was in my
purse and my purse was in the backseat.

1942
01:48:13,050 --> 01:48:14,190
I wasn't using the phone.
He's like,

1943
01:48:14,191 --> 01:48:18,130
how often do you use the phone when
you're driving? I was like, never. And,

1944
01:48:18,170 --> 01:48:21,240
and I was like, I would never do
that. I know that I made the u turn,

1945
01:48:21,241 --> 01:48:24,450
I deserve the u turn ticket, please give
it to me and I'm, I'm going to go to,

1946
01:48:24,630 --> 01:48:26,220
it's like, where were you
going? And I was like,

1947
01:48:26,221 --> 01:48:30,030
I was just trying to go back to
work. And he's like, he was like,

1948
01:48:30,031 --> 01:48:34,470
when was the last time you deserved a
ticket? And I was like, what the fuck?

1949
01:48:34,471 --> 01:48:37,680
Where's this guy going with this?
Right. And then finally he was like,

1950
01:48:37,681 --> 01:48:39,540
where do you work?
And I was very close to work,

1951
01:48:39,541 --> 01:48:44,520
so I pointed down the street where
our offices are. And then he was like,

1952
01:48:44,640 --> 01:48:47,160
he was like, what do you do for
work? Oh No. Yeah. He's like,

1953
01:48:47,161 --> 01:48:50,010
what do you do for work? And I was
like, oh, I'm a reporter. Right.

1954
01:48:50,011 --> 01:48:53,070
I don't want to get into the details. Like
I'm actually an internet commentators.

1955
01:48:53,110 --> 01:48:56,820
Like what? I just said reporter.
And then he was like, he's like, oh,

1956
01:48:56,940 --> 01:49:00,060
there's a newspaper company down the
street. He was like an older cop,

1957
01:49:00,120 --> 01:49:04,470
I don't know. And I was like, no, I
work for a show called the young Turks.

1958
01:49:04,471 --> 01:49:07,590
It's an online new show. It's the
largest online news show in the world.

1959
01:49:07,890 --> 01:49:10,660
You had to tell him is
the largest fucking stats.

1960
01:49:12,900 --> 01:49:15,500
I mean, got to keep it real. He's
got to know what he's, you know,

1961
01:49:16,890 --> 01:49:21,810
and then he asks me, what are you going
to report on this little incident today?

1962
01:49:22,050 --> 01:49:26,130
Oh God. And then I was like, nothing.
I don't report on my personal life.

1963
01:49:26,610 --> 01:49:30,900
And then he slowly closes
aside citation book and he's,

1964
01:49:30,901 --> 01:49:34,950
and then he says, are you upset or
no? He's like, are you disappointed?

1965
01:49:34,951 --> 01:49:35,850
He use the word disappointed.

1966
01:49:35,851 --> 01:49:38,850
Are you disappointed that I'm
letting you off with a warning?

1967
01:49:39,690 --> 01:49:43,500
And I didn't know what to say. Like, do I
tell him yes because I deserve a ticket,

1968
01:49:43,501 --> 01:49:47,500
please give me a ticket officer, or do
I tell him no, I'm not disappointed.

1969
01:49:47,501 --> 01:49:50,260
I'm actually fucking stoked because I
don't want to pay hundreds of dollars for

1970
01:49:50,261 --> 01:49:53,260
this ticket.
So at first I didn't say anything at all.

1971
01:49:53,470 --> 01:49:55,750
I'm just standing there looking
pathetic and I'm crying.

1972
01:49:55,750 --> 01:49:59,650
I'm literally crying at this point. Right.
And then he was like, did you hear me?

1973
01:49:59,651 --> 01:50:02,830
He's like, are you disappointed that
I'm letting you off with a warning?

1974
01:50:03,220 --> 01:50:07,300
And I was like, no, I'm not
disappointed. And then he's like,

1975
01:50:07,330 --> 01:50:09,910
I hope you have a better day.
And then that was it.

1976
01:50:10,360 --> 01:50:15,250
It was the creepiest interaction I've
had with a cop. Do you think you crazy?

1977
01:50:16,000 --> 01:50:20,140
Um, no. I used to, but I don't
think I crazy anymore, but,

1978
01:50:20,400 --> 01:50:22,630
and I wasn't crying until he
told me to step out of the car.

1979
01:50:22,660 --> 01:50:26,410
That's a weird request. Yeah, that's
a, that's a power move for sure. Yeah.

1980
01:50:26,520 --> 01:50:29,020
Not a threat. He didn't do
anything dangerous. You're not.

1981
01:50:29,050 --> 01:50:33,580
I was the most criminal activity.
I told him I deserve the ticket.

1982
01:50:34,000 --> 01:50:37,300
I gave him my license, my
registration, I did nothing wrong.

1983
01:50:37,301 --> 01:50:40,150
There was no reason for him to
have me step out of the car. None.

1984
01:50:40,600 --> 01:50:44,970
That's the power trip part that everybody
hates about cops. Yeah, there's you,

1985
01:50:44,971 --> 01:50:47,710
you will run into people like
that every now and again.

1986
01:50:47,870 --> 01:50:48,703
You know,

1987
01:50:49,080 --> 01:50:53,520
they have so much power and in that
moment you feel so defenseless. Right?

1988
01:50:53,521 --> 01:50:54,290
So you,

1989
01:50:54,290 --> 01:50:58,730
for someone like me who like I
hate admitting this about myself,

1990
01:50:58,731 --> 01:51:02,660
but sometimes in cases like that
I will cave into authority. Right?

1991
01:51:02,690 --> 01:51:05,360
I like to question authority,
but in a situation like that,

1992
01:51:05,690 --> 01:51:08,840
I'm not questioning authority.
I'm doing exactly what he wants me to do.

1993
01:51:08,841 --> 01:51:13,190
I'm doing, I feel powerless. Right.
So now that I think about it,

1994
01:51:13,191 --> 01:51:17,180
in retrospect, I get angry because I
wish I would've handled it differently.

1995
01:51:17,300 --> 01:51:20,420
I wish I would have gotten
his badge number. I wish I
would have gotten his name.

1996
01:51:20,840 --> 01:51:25,280
I wish I would have been able to do a
report on it on our show and actually be

1997
01:51:25,281 --> 01:51:28,850
like, hey, this is a cop from Culver
city and this is what he did. Right?

1998
01:51:29,540 --> 01:51:33,560
But I didn't think about it in the moment
because I was so scared and I felt so

1999
01:51:33,561 --> 01:51:36,470
powerless. I don't know.
It was a crazy experience.

2000
01:51:36,560 --> 01:51:38,690
Okay, so here, here's
why that's disturbing.

2001
01:51:39,310 --> 01:51:43,760
This is turban cause
you're this very powerful,

2002
01:51:44,060 --> 01:51:46,670
intelligent,
like outspoken person.

2003
01:51:46,671 --> 01:51:51,671
You speak regularly online to untold
millions of people worldwide in these

2004
01:51:52,551 --> 01:51:55,910
videos.
And yet in this one interaction,

2005
01:51:55,970 --> 01:51:59,300
you were so taken aback by this carbon.

2006
01:51:59,301 --> 01:52:02,210
So scare that you were
crying and in in you,

2007
01:52:02,330 --> 01:52:06,500
you didn't get this guy's badge number.
You didn't get this guy. Who are you?

2008
01:52:06,501 --> 01:52:08,330
Who has the recourse?
You,

2009
01:52:08,331 --> 01:52:12,770
who has the vehicle for delivering
this information all over the world and

2010
01:52:12,800 --> 01:52:16,790
exposing this real thing that
you went through, you didn't.

2011
01:52:16,940 --> 01:52:20,360
So now imagine a girl who's insecure,

2012
01:52:20,420 --> 01:52:22,730
a girl who was terrified
of public speaking,

2013
01:52:22,940 --> 01:52:27,290
a girl who maybe has had some sort of
a weird background that you grew up and

2014
01:52:27,291 --> 01:52:30,230
she's in that sort of the same situation.
She runs into that same asphalt.

2015
01:52:30,390 --> 01:52:33,300
Yeah, no, I, I can't
even imagine it. I can't,

2016
01:52:33,460 --> 01:52:33,641
yeah,

2017
01:52:33,641 --> 01:52:37,120
I mean they would be like shaking and
weeping at freaking the fuck out and this

2018
01:52:37,121 --> 01:52:38,400
guy gets off on that.
I mean that's,

2019
01:52:38,450 --> 01:52:41,410
that's really what you're dealing with
and it shows how effective it is that it

2020
01:52:41,411 --> 01:52:46,010
works on you cause you're not a pussy. No,
I'm not saying that to a truck. Yeah, you

2021
01:52:46,010 --> 01:52:47,090
can say,
you can say to me,

2022
01:52:47,091 --> 01:52:50,900
I'm not going to be offended by it was
the wrong thing. So you can call. Yeah,

2023
01:52:50,901 --> 01:52:55,070
you can say it's like too confusing.
It's like too many variables.

2024
01:52:56,450 --> 01:53:01,320
You're not a coward. Not at all. You're
you, you confront things and so for,

2025
01:53:01,420 --> 01:53:02,870
for you to be freaked out by it,

2026
01:53:02,871 --> 01:53:07,610
it should really sort of highlights what
a confrontational situation that is and

2027
01:53:07,611 --> 01:53:09,680
how it can really be a problem.

2028
01:53:09,730 --> 01:53:11,690
And there were a lot of
factors that played a role.

2029
01:53:11,691 --> 01:53:14,090
Not only was there the
power imbalance there,

2030
01:53:14,750 --> 01:53:18,920
but there was also the fact that he was
just this huge cop that was towering

2031
01:53:18,921 --> 01:53:23,921
over me as I was standing there in front
of him and I felt so small and I felt

2032
01:53:24,501 --> 01:53:29,501
like he was so angry for no freaking
reason that I was so scared that if I said

2033
01:53:30,321 --> 01:53:34,250
the wrong thing, that he might do
something to me. You know? Even though,

2034
01:53:34,251 --> 01:53:35,200
even though my cohort,

2035
01:53:35,210 --> 01:53:39,050
there were three coworkers in the car
after it all happened, they were like,

2036
01:53:39,890 --> 01:53:43,360
that sounds insane. Cops will like
literally like a really bad cop.

2037
01:53:43,370 --> 01:53:47,260
Literally put himself in a situation
where you put your hand up to stop him and

2038
01:53:47,270 --> 01:53:48,103
if you touch him,

2039
01:53:48,110 --> 01:53:50,900
that's assault and then they grab you
and throw you to the ground. I mean,

2040
01:53:50,910 --> 01:53:53,240
I've seen a scared,
that's why I was so scared.

2041
01:53:53,241 --> 01:53:54,740
I didn't know what he was going to do,

2042
01:53:54,741 --> 01:53:58,940
but he definitely got off on me standing
in front of him weeping like that.

2043
01:53:58,941 --> 01:54:02,540
He definitely got off on the fact that
I recognize that there was an imbalance

2044
01:54:02,541 --> 01:54:06,170
of power there. And I
don't know, like I, again,

2045
01:54:06,171 --> 01:54:10,820
I think about it in retrospect and it
makes me so angry and in the moment I was

2046
01:54:10,821 --> 01:54:14,680
so powerless vigilante and just go
running red lights to funds, motherfucker.

2047
01:54:15,260 --> 01:54:17,480
I mean I would love to son of a bitch,

2048
01:54:17,750 --> 01:54:21,110
I wish I could identify
him and I don't know,

2049
01:54:22,040 --> 01:54:24,710
get some sort of justice, but
imagine, think about that.

2050
01:54:24,711 --> 01:54:29,711
Think about the relatively minuscule
amount of discomfort I felt in that

2051
01:54:31,131 --> 01:54:34,910
situation compared to what
other people deal with.

2052
01:54:35,780 --> 01:54:40,280
I mean, think about how powerless
and how angry those people are.

2053
01:54:40,490 --> 01:54:43,820
And so when you have angry protesters,
right,

2054
01:54:44,330 --> 01:54:47,930
that are responding to Ferguson or
Eric Garner and all those other things,

2055
01:54:48,170 --> 01:54:51,410
and then they have the media tell them,
you guys are too violent,

2056
01:54:51,411 --> 01:54:54,890
you need to calm down, can you understand
why they'd be so angry? Oh, for sure.

2057
01:54:55,100 --> 01:54:55,281
Yeah,

2058
01:54:55,281 --> 01:54:59,750
I mean it totally makes sense that they
would want to do something as disruptive

2059
01:54:59,751 --> 01:55:01,070
as stopping the highway traffic.

2060
01:55:01,100 --> 01:55:05,420
And it certainly does move
the conversation because
people have to address it.

2061
01:55:05,450 --> 01:55:10,430
And it may be so impactful that cops
might actually think twice before they

2062
01:55:10,431 --> 01:55:14,000
squeeze a trigger because they don't
want more craziness and more Russians of

2063
01:55:14,001 --> 01:55:17,420
violence and or rather a
protest, not violence. In fact,

2064
01:55:17,450 --> 01:55:19,850
cops actually doing the van,
you see that,

2065
01:55:19,851 --> 01:55:22,790
that one undercover cop that
got busted and he, he had a gun,

2066
01:55:22,791 --> 01:55:26,930
he was pointing at the guy
taking a picture because
they were causing violence.

2067
01:55:26,931 --> 01:55:28,600
There were doing shit,
you know, like they,

2068
01:55:28,601 --> 01:55:31,460
they've done this tactic
for the longest time.

2069
01:55:31,790 --> 01:55:36,790
Like one of the ways that they can stop
protest is they use what's called agent

2070
01:55:36,801 --> 01:55:41,801
provocateurs and agent provocateurs
or someone who looks like a regular

2071
01:55:42,350 --> 01:55:44,190
protester.
But what

2072
01:55:44,190 --> 01:55:49,190
they are is police officers or military
or people they hire and they go in and

2073
01:55:49,261 --> 01:55:52,080
they'll wear bandanas and cover their
face and shit and they'll start smashing

2074
01:55:52,081 --> 01:55:52,560
things.

2075
01:55:52,560 --> 01:55:57,100
They'll smash windows and they'll turn
things into looting riot type situation

2076
01:55:57,101 --> 01:56:02,101
so that the cops have reason to move in
with force and start arresting people.

2077
01:56:02,820 --> 01:56:05,520
And that's how they
stop a peaceful protest.

2078
01:56:05,970 --> 01:56:10,970
And it's so creepy that this is a tactic
that has been used for a long time and

2079
01:56:11,840 --> 01:56:16,200
it was always like one of those conspiracy
theory, tin foil hat, stupid things,

2080
01:56:16,500 --> 01:56:19,860
and then we realized, oh no, these
motherfuckers really do this.

2081
01:56:20,180 --> 01:56:24,230
It happens. Yeah. I remember the first
time I had heard about agent provocateurs,

2082
01:56:24,231 --> 01:56:29,060
I was like, come on guys.
How conspiratorial and
loony is that? So loony,

2083
01:56:29,090 --> 01:56:31,610
and then I realized it
was happening with occupy.

2084
01:56:31,611 --> 01:56:35,600
I realized that it was happening
with recent protests and it's just,

2085
01:56:36,650 --> 01:56:40,730
I love how they try to discredit
peaceful protest by doing that,

2086
01:56:40,760 --> 01:56:42,810
by coming in and looting and,

2087
01:56:42,840 --> 01:56:46,580
and starting violence and making it
seem as though all of the protesters are

2088
01:56:46,581 --> 01:56:50,300
violent. Because again, the mainstream
media is going to latch onto that.

2089
01:56:50,301 --> 01:56:53,540
And you're right. I think that that's
definitely better to drum up ratings.

2090
01:56:53,810 --> 01:56:57,440
I mean, if you're going to do a
news report on a peaceful protest,

2091
01:56:57,441 --> 01:56:59,570
is that going to do well with ratings?
Probably not.

2092
01:56:59,840 --> 01:57:04,310
If you're going to do coverage of looting
and violence that's taking place, um,

2093
01:57:04,520 --> 01:57:08,240
in relation to the protest,
people are going to be,
they're going to get fired up,

2094
01:57:08,241 --> 01:57:10,280
they're going to get angry and they're
going to start referring to these

2095
01:57:10,281 --> 01:57:13,810
protesters as animals and all that.
I mean, I've seen so much of that,

2096
01:57:14,080 --> 01:57:17,950
but don't you see a resistance to people
doing stories on the actual undercover

2097
01:57:17,951 --> 01:57:21,400
cops? He got busted pointing the gun
100%. I don't see anything on that.

2098
01:57:21,520 --> 01:57:24,230
I didn't see anything on that on CNN.
I didn't see anything on that,

2099
01:57:24,231 --> 01:57:25,930
on any of the coverage of the La riots.
I was like,

2100
01:57:25,931 --> 01:57:28,390
do you guys not understand
what's going on here?

2101
01:57:28,500 --> 01:57:31,970
CNN is probably still reporting
on the missing plane. I mean, see,

2102
01:57:31,980 --> 01:57:33,660
I don't know where CNN is right now.

2103
01:57:34,030 --> 01:57:38,350
These, these riots in Oakland rather not
la. Um, they, they were so fucking crazy,

2104
01:57:38,351 --> 01:57:41,910
man. These kids took over highways.
There's a lot of them, you know,

2105
01:57:41,920 --> 01:57:46,030
in a lot of them got arrested and the
to see that photo of that guy pointing a

2106
01:57:46,031 --> 01:57:49,420
gun at the camera man, who's, who's
pretending to be a protest. I was like,

2107
01:57:49,421 --> 01:57:53,320
what the fuck is going on?
Yeah. Like this is crazy.

2108
01:57:53,321 --> 01:57:56,860
You guys are pretending to be protestors.
You're smashing a window.

2109
01:57:57,040 --> 01:57:59,500
You get paid tax dollars to smash windows

2110
01:57:59,810 --> 01:58:04,400
tax dollars. They get paid tax dollars
to undermine a political process,

2111
01:58:04,401 --> 01:58:05,390
a democratic process

2112
01:58:05,500 --> 01:58:08,360
and turn it violence so they can come
and arrest people. That's amazing.

2113
01:58:08,590 --> 01:58:12,110
It's so bizarre. So bizarre. You
know, one other thing, those bizarre,

2114
01:58:12,111 --> 01:58:17,111
I saw a lot of people that were quote
unquote progressive's are quote unquote,

2115
01:58:17,300 --> 01:58:20,390
you know,
really leftwing strong left wing people.

2116
01:58:20,570 --> 01:58:25,570
And they were in at least
an if not an agreement.

2117
01:58:26,150 --> 01:58:27,910
They were, they were, um,

2118
01:58:28,460 --> 01:58:32,600
at least understanding of the people
who looted and smashed windows.

2119
01:58:32,930 --> 01:58:34,950
And one on one guy went to his,

2120
01:58:35,180 --> 01:58:39,980
his Twitter page and he had this crazy
statement like if people respect you,

2121
01:58:39,981 --> 01:58:40,820
they'll respect your,

2122
01:58:41,680 --> 01:58:45,280
obviously people didn't respect this place
and it was like an h and r block with

2123
01:58:45,281 --> 01:58:48,030
a brick through its window. I was
like, what are you doing? Like,

2124
01:58:48,070 --> 01:58:51,110
well this is crazy. Like Starbucks
is there smashing Starbucks is

2125
01:58:51,290 --> 01:58:54,120
for corporations. No, I can't stand that.

2126
01:58:54,170 --> 01:58:59,000
I mean that really does undermine attract
people from what the real message is.

2127
01:58:59,001 --> 01:59:02,830
The looters are not doing any
great service to the protest.

2128
01:59:02,840 --> 01:59:05,890
Question is how many of those looters
are cops? How many of them don't know?

2129
01:59:05,980 --> 01:59:08,310
I know many people who
are like strong super

2130
01:59:08,430 --> 01:59:12,120
recipe bar getting caught up in the
momentum that was actually kicked off by

2131
01:59:12,121 --> 01:59:15,240
vigilante cops or even
provoq agent provocateur

2132
01:59:15,290 --> 01:59:18,350
tour cops. Yeah, that would
be hilarious. And you know,

2133
01:59:18,351 --> 01:59:20,180
going back to the whole
journalism angle of it,

2134
01:59:20,210 --> 01:59:23,930
I mean that's what the great thing
about investigative journalism would be.

2135
01:59:24,140 --> 01:59:27,080
If we had strong investigative
journalists in this country,

2136
01:59:27,081 --> 01:59:30,530
they would take that beat and they would
go to these protests and investigate

2137
01:59:30,531 --> 01:59:33,590
and try to figure out how many agent
provocateurs there are out there. Right.

2138
01:59:33,620 --> 01:59:36,230
But we don't have that anymore.
And that's what's scary.

2139
01:59:36,231 --> 01:59:39,200
It's scary when you can only refer to
a few people in the country as good

2140
01:59:39,201 --> 01:59:41,870
journalists like Matt Taibbi,
Michael Hastings at one point.

2141
01:59:41,871 --> 01:59:44,690
Unfortunately he's not
here anymore. Um, you know,

2142
01:59:44,720 --> 01:59:48,050
the Jeremy Ski Hills of the world,
I dunno.

2143
01:59:48,510 --> 01:59:49,950
Yeah. I don't know either. And we,

2144
01:59:49,970 --> 01:59:53,910
we live in a very unique
and interesting time of, uh,

2145
01:59:53,930 --> 01:59:56,610
expanding possibilities.
So it's, it's cool.

2146
01:59:56,611 --> 01:59:58,410
It's cool to be a part of it
and watched it all going down.

2147
01:59:58,411 --> 02:00:01,670
But it's interesting trying to
see it sort itself out, you know,

2148
02:00:01,860 --> 02:00:06,320
has everything's going on, but
it's, it's hopeful to me. Uh,

2149
02:00:06,321 --> 02:00:07,740
I'm very hopeful,
you know,

2150
02:00:07,741 --> 02:00:09,750
even though there's a lot of
fucked up shit in the world,

2151
02:00:10,080 --> 02:00:13,770
I think that when I see
these like Oakland protests,

2152
02:00:14,340 --> 02:00:16,650
even though I don't agree
with shutting down highways,

2153
02:00:16,700 --> 02:00:20,610
I love the fact that there's this many
people that are pissed off at the way

2154
02:00:20,611 --> 02:00:22,900
things are going.
Even if they're misguided in,

2155
02:00:22,970 --> 02:00:26,310
in some way or overzealous in some way,
they're their,

2156
02:00:26,530 --> 02:00:30,450
their intentions are the correct type of
intentions because they recognize that

2157
02:00:30,451 --> 02:00:34,800
we have a kind of a wacky system.
Yeah. You know, and, and I,

2158
02:00:34,980 --> 02:00:39,980
I think not enough attention is put on
the idea of cops and the idea of being a

2159
02:00:40,891 --> 02:00:44,580
cop being this insanely fucking
difficult thing to manage.

2160
02:00:45,180 --> 02:00:47,190
It's one of the reasons why
you see so much violence.

2161
02:00:47,340 --> 02:00:51,000
He sees that cop that was busted in
Denver who had the guy on the ground,

2162
02:00:51,001 --> 02:00:53,490
he was punching him in the face and
the wife came over, she was pregnant,

2163
02:00:53,491 --> 02:00:56,730
they trip the wife and she fell
down and no, I didn't see. Oh.

2164
02:00:56,820 --> 02:00:59,730
And then they took the guy's camera and
erase the picture of race, the video.

2165
02:00:59,731 --> 02:01:01,620
But he had already
uploaded it to the cloud.

2166
02:01:01,920 --> 02:01:04,830
So this guy got on the news with
this video of this cop jazz,

2167
02:01:04,831 --> 02:01:09,420
fucking throwing haymakers at this dude's
face. You know, it's just, come on man,

2168
02:01:09,421 --> 02:01:11,980
you don't have, there's no need to do
that. You don't have to do that. You're,

2169
02:01:11,981 --> 02:01:14,730
you're doing some, if you wanted
to arrest someone for a crime,

2170
02:01:14,830 --> 02:01:17,870
you don't have to punch him in the face.
I don't even fighting back. It is crazy.

2171
02:01:17,970 --> 02:01:18,270
Yeah.

2172
02:01:18,270 --> 02:01:22,290
I guess the only upside of
it is the political activism
that's coming out of it.

2173
02:01:22,400 --> 02:01:27,210
Um, but it's, it's funny
because, you know, you're
mentioning how you're hopeful,

2174
02:01:27,211 --> 02:01:29,970
but I feel like society keeps devolving.

2175
02:01:30,000 --> 02:01:34,290
Like it gets worse and worse and now we
have this whole situation like, you know,

2176
02:01:34,500 --> 02:01:36,000
not to do a stark transition,

2177
02:01:36,001 --> 02:01:39,710
but now we have like this ridiculous
situation with Sony and like the and,

2178
02:01:39,980 --> 02:01:41,320
and how we have Kim Jong,
Ooh.

2179
02:01:41,330 --> 02:01:45,080
And dictating what kind of
creative freedom we have
here in this country. I mean,

2180
02:01:45,081 --> 02:01:47,360
that kind of stuff is coming out
now and you're just like, really?

2181
02:01:47,361 --> 02:01:51,620
Is there really hope in this country
right now? If the interview goes down,

2182
02:01:51,621 --> 02:01:55,050
what hope could there possibly be?
It's not even about the interview going,

2183
02:01:55,790 --> 02:01:58,850
it's a Seth Rogen movie and they're not
going to put it in the movie theater.

2184
02:01:59,120 --> 02:02:01,010
We should just fucking move to the woods.

2185
02:02:01,250 --> 02:02:04,550
We should all just give up and
civilization. James Franco,

2186
02:02:04,551 --> 02:02:07,100
James Franco's in that mirror
to using that movie as well.

2187
02:02:07,101 --> 02:02:10,940
So this is a double disaster. This is
a huge box office head off the bat.

2188
02:02:10,970 --> 02:02:12,980
It's going to be number one
the first week it comes out.

2189
02:02:12,981 --> 02:02:14,120
It's all strategically planned.

2190
02:02:15,210 --> 02:02:20,060
Isn't that the best part of the story
that a freaking comedy movie featuring

2191
02:02:20,061 --> 02:02:25,061
Seth Rogen and James Franco is what
caused like this ridiculous hack and it's

2192
02:02:26,121 --> 02:02:29,210
what cause like the North
Korean government to be up
and I was like, I get it.

2193
02:02:29,210 --> 02:02:32,150
The storyline can be a little
offensive to your dictator, right?

2194
02:02:32,151 --> 02:02:35,120
If it has to do with assassinating
him their dear leader. Right.

2195
02:02:35,390 --> 02:02:39,710
But like I feel like this entire story
in this entire situation is full of

2196
02:02:39,711 --> 02:02:44,540
pussies. Right? Oh God,
this is fucking crazy.

2197
02:02:44,541 --> 02:02:47,930
Armenian Bra came in here,
but it's true. It's true.

2198
02:02:47,931 --> 02:02:50,960
You have policies on one side
with Sony backing down from,

2199
02:02:51,290 --> 02:02:56,290
from the movie you have supposedly North
Korean pussies that are so offended by

2200
02:02:56,901 --> 02:02:59,930
a movie. They're like, oh my God,
how dare you offend our dear leader.

2201
02:02:59,931 --> 02:03:01,070
We're going to go after you.

2202
02:03:01,380 --> 02:03:06,380
I mean all around just a bunch of people
that are scared and I get the email

2203
02:03:07,281 --> 02:03:11,720
hack was devastating for Sony.
A lot of private information,

2204
02:03:11,721 --> 02:03:16,340
embarrassing information was leaked to
the press. Right? But at the same time,

2205
02:03:17,060 --> 02:03:17,893
like you,

2206
02:03:18,020 --> 02:03:23,020
you can't let a dictator of a country
like North Korea make decisions about what

2207
02:03:23,931 --> 02:03:28,130
your company should district distribute
as a movie. Like it's ridiculous. No,

2208
02:03:28,131 --> 02:03:30,230
Bama said it,
which I thought was amazing.

2209
02:03:30,530 --> 02:03:33,530
I go bomb was commenting on
a movie being distributed.

2210
02:03:33,960 --> 02:03:37,190
It should become an international affair.
It really has.

2211
02:03:38,540 --> 02:03:41,420
I don't know how this is gonna end up,

2212
02:03:41,421 --> 02:03:45,170
but one thing that I will say is I'm not
going to believe the feds that this is

2213
02:03:45,200 --> 02:03:47,420
100% in North Korea is doing.

2214
02:03:47,450 --> 02:03:50,570
Like for some reason I find
it inconceivable that it's
a bunch of hackers from

2215
02:03:50,571 --> 02:03:54,950
North Korea doing this 14 year old kid
in Australia, in his underwear right now,

2216
02:03:55,190 --> 02:03:58,100
laughing his ass off.
I was thinking about that yesterday.

2217
02:03:58,660 --> 02:04:01,670
It's speculation and I have
no evidence to prove it right.

2218
02:04:01,671 --> 02:04:06,590
But like a lot of these hackers are like
teenagers and they're really smart and

2219
02:04:06,591 --> 02:04:08,840
they're really savvy and sometimes
they're not even smart and savvy.

2220
02:04:08,841 --> 02:04:12,770
Sometimes people are really stupid with
their passwords and all they have to do

2221
02:04:12,771 --> 02:04:15,870
is guess, and the hackers will get
into their email and that's it. Right?

2222
02:04:16,310 --> 02:04:19,340
Reality is if someone can
break into your system,

2223
02:04:19,341 --> 02:04:22,220
if you haven't found that someone
isolated them and arrested them,

2224
02:04:22,470 --> 02:04:26,450
then you don't know who the fuck they
are. Okay. You just don't. So if you're,

2225
02:04:26,451 --> 02:04:29,990
if you're just taking any old
threat from someone like that,

2226
02:04:29,991 --> 02:04:34,250
and it's saying it's Kim Jong Moon
and you're not giving us any reason to

2227
02:04:34,251 --> 02:04:37,130
believe you, we got, well, I don't
know. I don't know if you're right.

2228
02:04:37,170 --> 02:04:41,580
You might be right. It could be him.
I mean, he's got 1800 cyber warriors.

2229
02:04:42,000 --> 02:04:44,850
They're there. They're ready to rock
and roll a fucking any given time.

2230
02:04:44,851 --> 02:04:48,540
They're all in line that goose step
over to their desks and at least start

2231
02:04:48,541 --> 02:04:51,420
fucking people up all over
the world for the dear leader.

2232
02:04:51,550 --> 02:04:55,000
And it's also kind of amazing that like
in this day and age where we've given up

2233
02:04:55,001 --> 02:04:58,060
so much of our individual liberty,

2234
02:04:58,090 --> 02:05:00,850
our freedoms in the name
of national security,

2235
02:05:00,880 --> 02:05:03,220
all we need is one anonymous threat,

2236
02:05:03,580 --> 02:05:06,130
that there would be another
nine 11 type attack.

2237
02:05:06,370 --> 02:05:09,820
And then we back out of like showing
a movie. I mean, think about it.

2238
02:05:09,821 --> 02:05:14,260
Think about how we're all spied on
indiscriminately on a daily basis. Okay.

2239
02:05:14,500 --> 02:05:16,090
Think about the fact that you know,

2240
02:05:16,091 --> 02:05:20,710
after nine 11 we gave away so many of
our rights because we were so afraid of

2241
02:05:20,711 --> 02:05:23,590
these big bad terrorist and the government
supposed to be keeping us safe, right?

2242
02:05:23,591 --> 02:05:25,990
The CIA supposed to be
on top of everything.

2243
02:05:26,110 --> 02:05:29,980
Our intelligence is supposed to be top
of the line and all it takes is one

2244
02:05:29,981 --> 02:05:33,390
anonymous threat and people are like
tucking tail and hiding behind the bed.

2245
02:05:33,740 --> 02:05:36,440
Isn't that the fault? I mean,
or I shouldn't say the fault,

2246
02:05:36,770 --> 02:05:39,710
isn't that the decision
though of the company itself?

2247
02:05:39,740 --> 02:05:43,130
Because Obama himself has said that
he thinks that it was a mistake.

2248
02:05:43,140 --> 02:05:46,400
So it really doesn't matter whether or
not the CIA protects anybody or whether

2249
02:05:46,401 --> 02:05:50,780
or not the FBI, they, it was their
choice. Yeah. It never moved past that.

2250
02:05:50,810 --> 02:05:52,670
So I don't think it's in that situation.

2251
02:05:52,671 --> 02:05:56,450
I think it's fair to blame like
the CIA or any of those people.

2252
02:05:56,451 --> 02:06:00,110
It's just like they decided
to pull it out. Oh, Mama
told them that was a mistake.

2253
02:06:00,160 --> 02:06:02,980
No, no, I, I agree with you
on that. But at the same time,

2254
02:06:02,981 --> 02:06:07,660
like aren't we supposed to have certain
agencies within our government that know

2255
02:06:07,690 --> 02:06:10,930
everything because they're
spying on everyone?

2256
02:06:11,200 --> 02:06:13,750
This is the reality in
argument for it, right? No,

2257
02:06:13,751 --> 02:06:17,090
this is actually an argument against
it because they spy on so many goddamn

2258
02:06:17,110 --> 02:06:22,110
people that are completely innocent
that their systems are just like full of

2259
02:06:22,450 --> 02:06:26,540
information and data. That's
absolutely useless. Okay. So the,

2260
02:06:26,770 --> 02:06:29,340
that's one of the biggest issues
that I have with this. Um,

2261
02:06:29,470 --> 02:06:34,470
I interviewed Laura Poitras's on a
show called take part live and she was

2262
02:06:35,230 --> 02:06:36,610
getting into detail about that,

2263
02:06:36,611 --> 02:06:40,000
about how the way that we
collect intelligence right
now is actually the most

2264
02:06:40,001 --> 02:06:44,050
ineffective way because we're collecting
so much data on people that are totally

2265
02:06:44,051 --> 02:06:44,770
innocent.

2266
02:06:44,770 --> 02:06:49,510
So how do you sift through all of
this data and determine whether or not

2267
02:06:49,511 --> 02:06:50,500
someone's an actual threat?

2268
02:06:51,090 --> 02:06:53,410
Yeah. How do you, do they have, uh, the,

2269
02:06:53,411 --> 02:06:55,680
the building it like building
a storage facilities,

2270
02:06:55,681 --> 02:06:58,830
hoping they'll have better
search mechanisms in the
future? Is that the idea?

2271
02:06:58,880 --> 02:07:01,760
I have no idea. But what they're
doing right now isn't working. I mean,

2272
02:07:01,761 --> 02:07:05,090
when you have something like the Boston
bombing and you have like terrorist

2273
02:07:05,091 --> 02:07:08,150
attack, I mean, look, we, we don't have
terrorists attacks here all the time.

2274
02:07:08,240 --> 02:07:08,841
You know what I mean?

2275
02:07:08,841 --> 02:07:12,680
Like despite the fear mongering that
you see in the mainstream media, um,

2276
02:07:12,681 --> 02:07:14,120
it's just fear mongering,
right?

2277
02:07:14,121 --> 02:07:17,570
But every once in a while when you do
have some sort of event like the Boston

2278
02:07:17,571 --> 02:07:20,450
bombing, it's like,
well, I don't know NSA.

2279
02:07:20,451 --> 02:07:23,540
You've been collecting all this
information on everyone and you have these

2280
02:07:23,541 --> 02:07:25,460
people that are posting things online,

2281
02:07:25,461 --> 02:07:29,060
talking about how they
want to kill Americans and
plotting to do certain things.

2282
02:07:29,061 --> 02:07:31,280
How come you didn't catch these guys?
Well,

2283
02:07:31,310 --> 02:07:34,730
like why is it that you guys are focusing
so heavily on the type of porn people

2284
02:07:34,731 --> 02:07:38,700
are, but you're not focusing heavily on,
you know, the real threats that are out.

2285
02:07:38,990 --> 02:07:39,141
Well,

2286
02:07:39,141 --> 02:07:42,410
that's where it's a real shame when you've
got a bunch of agent provocateurs at

2287
02:07:42,411 --> 02:07:45,250
occupy Wall Street where nothing
bad is happening. That's,

2288
02:07:45,530 --> 02:07:49,190
that's where it's a shame. It's like, I
don't know who, what agency they're from,

2289
02:07:49,191 --> 02:07:52,890
whether or not they could be involved with
some sort of a terrorist activity, uh,

2290
02:07:52,910 --> 02:07:54,440
investigation unit.
But if you,

2291
02:07:54,620 --> 02:07:59,090
if you wasted resources looking after
hippies and a drum circle and that could

2292
02:07:59,091 --> 02:08:00,560
have possibly saved somebody's life,

2293
02:08:00,740 --> 02:08:03,650
he we're going to be like really
understandably pissed off,

2294
02:08:03,770 --> 02:08:06,680
which is one of the things about this
agent provocateur thing in Oakland,

2295
02:08:06,681 --> 02:08:09,320
the piss people off. It's like, come
on. Yeah, we're paying for that.

2296
02:08:09,321 --> 02:08:11,870
We actually pay for that.
Our taxes.

2297
02:08:11,871 --> 02:08:16,040
Every citizen contributes to the payroll.
I mean that's crazy.

2298
02:08:16,070 --> 02:08:19,340
They're paying you guys to undermine
us and you guys to break windows and

2299
02:08:19,341 --> 02:08:22,940
pretend you're fucking bad protesters
and tried to start people looting so that

2300
02:08:22,941 --> 02:08:26,960
you can get come in and sweep them into
the paddy wagon and fulfill quotas.

2301
02:08:27,230 --> 02:08:28,580
That's the weirdest thing.

2302
02:08:28,730 --> 02:08:33,470
Like what the fuck would they do if we
all collectively as a country decided we

2303
02:08:33,471 --> 02:08:37,850
will not break any laws for 30 days,
they'll probably frame us.

2304
02:08:37,910 --> 02:08:41,900
They would have to start framing us. We,
their budgets would fall apart there.

2305
02:08:41,920 --> 02:08:45,170
They're fucking departments would fall
apart when it came time to like budget

2306
02:08:45,171 --> 02:08:48,680
meetings and shit. Well we've had no
crime since 19 blah, blah, blah blah.

2307
02:08:48,760 --> 02:08:53,680
Why do you think a police enforcement
for the most part is against legalizing

2308
02:08:53,681 --> 02:08:56,230
marijuana or legalizing drugs in general?

2309
02:08:56,500 --> 02:09:00,850
It's because they will be out of jobs.
I mean, there will still be crime,

2310
02:09:00,851 --> 02:09:01,684
obviously,

2311
02:09:01,840 --> 02:09:05,800
but when you look at our incarceration
rate and how we incarcerate more people

2312
02:09:05,801 --> 02:09:07,300
than any other country in the world,

2313
02:09:07,330 --> 02:09:12,190
it's because of drug laws and there
is a lot of profit to be made off.

2314
02:09:12,191 --> 02:09:13,570
The prohibition of marijuana.

2315
02:09:13,840 --> 02:09:16,930
Cops make money off of it
that keeps them in business.

2316
02:09:17,020 --> 02:09:21,490
Correctional officers remain in business.
Private prisons remain in business.

2317
02:09:21,491 --> 02:09:23,890
There's a lot of money behind prohibition.

2318
02:09:24,060 --> 02:09:27,520
Yeah. Stopping people from doing
things that they want to do. Yeah,

2319
02:09:27,660 --> 02:09:31,350
that doesn't hurt you is ridiculous
and it's some daddy shit.

2320
02:09:31,380 --> 02:09:34,380
You're your daddying people. You're
telling them what they can and can't do,

2321
02:09:34,530 --> 02:09:37,470
and then I include things that I'm
totally opposed to like cigarettes.

2322
02:09:37,800 --> 02:09:39,570
I think cigarettes are
the dumbest way to die.

2323
02:09:39,620 --> 02:09:43,620
It just drives me crazy when I see
good friends who have a problem with

2324
02:09:43,621 --> 02:09:46,920
cigarettes and they can't kick it. I'm
like, I'm watching you poison yourself.

2325
02:09:47,250 --> 02:09:50,010
Like this is so stupid,
but I'm 100% in favor.

2326
02:09:50,011 --> 02:09:52,830
You'd be able to do it if you
want to do it. Same here. Fuck.

2327
02:09:52,930 --> 02:09:55,530
Who is anybody to tell another
person what they can't do.

2328
02:09:56,150 --> 02:09:57,330
It's one thing to tell a person,

2329
02:09:57,331 --> 02:10:00,720
don't commit a crime or don't
commit assault or don't harm people,

2330
02:10:00,990 --> 02:10:04,350
but that's the number one problem with
the government telling you that anything

2331
02:10:04,351 --> 02:10:07,380
is illegal, whether it's mushrooms
or prostitution or anything.

2332
02:10:07,560 --> 02:10:09,360
It says who says who.

2333
02:10:10,060 --> 02:10:10,320
Look,

2334
02:10:10,320 --> 02:10:14,340
that's one of the reasons why I'm in
favor of legalizing things and regulating

2335
02:10:14,341 --> 02:10:18,120
them with common sense regulations.
So like with prostitution,

2336
02:10:18,150 --> 02:10:19,830
legalize and regulate it.
Okay,

2337
02:10:19,831 --> 02:10:24,390
so these people can say it's safe when
they're trading sex for money with drugs,

2338
02:10:24,630 --> 02:10:27,120
obviously I'm not saying, hey,
this is a wild, wild west,

2339
02:10:27,121 --> 02:10:29,400
let's legalize everything
and not have any regulations.

2340
02:10:29,700 --> 02:10:31,620
And that's usually what are like,

2341
02:10:31,621 --> 02:10:36,350
that's the type of argument
that pro prohibition people
will say, right? Like, Oh,

2342
02:10:36,351 --> 02:10:37,161
if you legalize it,

2343
02:10:37,161 --> 02:10:40,280
all of a sudden like 10 year olds are
going to be smoking pot. No they're not.

2344
02:10:40,370 --> 02:10:40,911
No they're not.

2345
02:10:40,911 --> 02:10:44,600
We have laws put in place to make sure
that 10 year olds aren't drinking alcohol.

2346
02:10:44,870 --> 02:10:46,460
You do the same thing with marijuana.

2347
02:10:46,590 --> 02:10:48,320
There's also an issue with a,

2348
02:10:48,440 --> 02:10:52,350
there's not an issue of public opinion
because public opinion is very important,

2349
02:10:52,351 --> 02:10:57,351
but there is an issue with needing 50%
or more of the people to agree in order

2350
02:10:58,981 --> 02:11:01,260
to give you freedom. Like, Whoa,
Whoa, Whoa, Whoa, whoa, Whoa, whoa.

2351
02:11:01,440 --> 02:11:03,840
It's not that hard to trick.
Half the people,

2352
02:11:04,020 --> 02:11:06,620
they have mortgages and fucking softball.

2353
02:11:06,630 --> 02:11:08,820
They have to get their kids
dressed for and there, you know,

2354
02:11:09,030 --> 02:11:14,030
it's not that hard to trick people about
stories of brain damage and memory loss

2355
02:11:14,191 --> 02:11:15,270
and men Bra and tits,

2356
02:11:15,410 --> 02:11:20,270
that there's plenty of fake data that
you can bandy around in court and,

2357
02:11:20,271 --> 02:11:23,760
and, and people could get
confused. So 50% is not good.

2358
02:11:23,970 --> 02:11:27,000
50% is not a healthy number.
What it should be.

2359
02:11:27,240 --> 02:11:30,990
Let's find out first what
category we put these laws in.

2360
02:11:31,140 --> 02:11:36,120
Here's a category. Does it hurt
anybody else? No. Okay. So let's,

2361
02:11:36,150 --> 02:11:39,060
let's, this is a personal choice
category. Yes. So it should,

2362
02:11:39,061 --> 02:11:41,730
it doesn't even have to be 1% right.
This is what it should be.

2363
02:11:41,940 --> 02:11:46,940
How many people are opposed to it and
what are your reasons for being opposed to

2364
02:11:47,281 --> 02:11:50,730
it and are they rational and are they
based on the data we currently are aware

2365
02:11:50,731 --> 02:11:54,240
of? Yeah. And if they're not, they're
not valid. And you need to say like,

2366
02:11:54,270 --> 02:11:59,130
do you believe that marijuana makes you
grow tits? Do you believe that marijuana,

2367
02:11:59,131 --> 02:12:02,820
cause I had like some lady,
she was telling me testicular cancer,

2368
02:12:02,821 --> 02:12:05,820
I'm like what are you talking about?
Yeah. Or read it online. Like no, you did

2369
02:12:06,170 --> 02:12:10,480
must making this up. Well and also if
you've read it online, it must be true

2370
02:12:10,720 --> 02:12:13,810
person. My point is, could vote on it.
If they went to the ballot and they go,

2371
02:12:13,811 --> 02:12:15,850
Oh fuck that.
I don't want my children hooked on.

2372
02:12:15,851 --> 02:12:20,470
We click and they hit that there. Their
vote, whether informed or not. It's valid.

2373
02:12:20,471 --> 02:12:23,320
And I think you should
have to prove that your,

2374
02:12:23,470 --> 02:12:26,020
your point in some way is informed.

2375
02:12:26,160 --> 02:12:29,430
Well, one, that's one of the
issues with ballot initiatives. Um,

2376
02:12:29,580 --> 02:12:32,430
not only are people either uninformed,

2377
02:12:32,580 --> 02:12:35,760
but they're also misinformed a lot of
times because there's a lot of money

2378
02:12:35,761 --> 02:12:39,810
behind the advertisements that are
either for or against ballot initiatives.

2379
02:12:39,811 --> 02:12:40,500
Right.

2380
02:12:40,500 --> 02:12:45,060
And the thing that amazes
me about political ads is
politicians can straight out

2381
02:12:45,061 --> 02:12:49,380
lie. Yeah. Political action committees
can straight out lie in any political ad.

2382
02:12:49,381 --> 02:12:54,060
And why is it that when it comes to an
advertisement for a product like beer for

2383
02:12:54,061 --> 02:12:57,930
instance, right? Like if Samuel
Adams was to advertise right now,

2384
02:12:57,931 --> 02:13:01,920
like our beer is going to give you super
powers and you're gonna all of a sudden

2385
02:13:02,460 --> 02:13:06,090
lose 20 pounds and like they can't
do that. It's false advertising.

2386
02:13:06,091 --> 02:13:09,570
Why is it the politicians are able to
falsely advertise whatever the hell they

2387
02:13:09,571 --> 02:13:10,404
want?

2388
02:13:10,950 --> 02:13:13,320
It's probably because
they're the gatekeepers and
they're the ones who get to

2389
02:13:13,321 --> 02:13:15,300
decide whether or not
something is illegal.

2390
02:13:15,301 --> 02:13:18,360
But I've seen so many political ads
where I'm like, that's not true.

2391
02:13:18,510 --> 02:13:21,450
That's not true. Why are they
able to say this? That's amazing.

2392
02:13:21,660 --> 02:13:25,530
So with ballot initiatives, if
there's money behind, you know,

2393
02:13:25,590 --> 02:13:28,050
there's legalized bribery
behind a lot of it. Um,

2394
02:13:28,080 --> 02:13:30,270
there's a lot of misinformation
behind a lot of it.

2395
02:13:30,271 --> 02:13:32,160
And if you're not someone who sits

2396
02:13:32,160 --> 02:13:34,710
down and analyzes political news all day,

2397
02:13:34,800 --> 02:13:37,740
it's very easy for you to be misinformed.
And that's not your fault.

2398
02:13:37,741 --> 02:13:41,280
It's because of the system and
how it's set up against you. Yeah.

2399
02:13:41,281 --> 02:13:45,100
And it's also known as an
incentive to change it, to
make it even. Yeah. You know,

2400
02:13:45,120 --> 02:13:47,520
why would we do that?
Let everybody wait a bit.

2401
02:13:47,521 --> 02:13:50,580
We're going to make less money
and what else is going to happen?

2402
02:13:50,610 --> 02:13:53,190
There's going to be less jobs
and what else is going to happen?

2403
02:13:53,220 --> 02:13:56,610
They're going to have some power. Fuck.
It's the same thing with climate change.

2404
02:13:56,611 --> 02:14:01,110
I mean, people immediately go to Oh, less
jobs and that's all I really care about.

2405
02:14:01,710 --> 02:14:05,970
I've had conversations with
that, with people about that.
When they see, um, the, uh,

2406
02:14:05,971 --> 02:14:08,010
all the oil work that do end up in Canada,

2407
02:14:08,210 --> 02:14:11,280
that devastation to the environment around
it. And you're like looking at photos,

2408
02:14:11,281 --> 02:14:15,480
you're like, Holy Shit. And people are
like, oh, relax. It's just a little bit,

2409
02:14:15,980 --> 02:14:18,780
because so many jobs are
dependent upon that. They're very,

2410
02:14:19,020 --> 02:14:21,690
very sensitive to people criticizing it.
If you don't know,

2411
02:14:21,780 --> 02:14:23,530
if you're not from around there,
I mean they,

2412
02:14:23,550 --> 02:14:26,430
that's like a major source of income
for a lot of folks up there and I

2413
02:14:26,431 --> 02:14:29,850
understand it because that's
your livelihood and you
don't want anyone messing

2414
02:14:29,851 --> 02:14:30,541
with their livelihood,

2415
02:14:30,541 --> 02:14:33,870
which is why it's so important for the
federal government to invest in renewable

2416
02:14:33,871 --> 02:14:37,680
energy because then you transfer the jobs,
you know,

2417
02:14:38,670 --> 02:14:43,410
from dirty coal and whatever the hell
we're doing to renewable energy sources.

2418
02:14:43,440 --> 02:14:45,060
New Jobs can be created,

2419
02:14:45,061 --> 02:14:48,360
but we're not even willing to have that
conversation because right now we're

2420
02:14:48,361 --> 02:14:51,660
stuck on this ridiculous debate as to
whether or not climate change is manmade

2421
02:14:51,661 --> 02:14:53,160
or not.
Why are we having that debate?

2422
02:14:53,340 --> 02:14:55,500
Why are we having that
debate drives me crazy.

2423
02:14:55,800 --> 02:14:59,010
I think we need to work
in la for sure on solar.

2424
02:14:59,220 --> 02:15:03,330
It's so ridiculous that we live in a
place that's literally sunny 300 days a

2425
02:15:03,331 --> 02:15:06,810
year and if you fly over it, you don't
see a single solar panel. It's crazy.

2426
02:15:07,160 --> 02:15:11,070
I know that the expense of the
technology is right now it's pretty high,

2427
02:15:11,340 --> 02:15:14,100
but I guarantee within
the next decade or so,

2428
02:15:14,101 --> 02:15:17,100
it's gonna drop down to some sort of
a manageable point where people will

2429
02:15:17,101 --> 02:15:19,800
consider installing them on the
top of every building. Yeah,

2430
02:15:20,030 --> 02:15:24,950
you've got free electricity. I mean, it's
gotta be worth something. It's even if,

2431
02:15:25,050 --> 02:15:27,150
even if it's not 100% of
your electrical output,

2432
02:15:27,330 --> 02:15:30,840
it's probably like high forties 50 I mean,
I don't know,

2433
02:15:30,940 --> 02:15:34,470
but as they get better at these things,
I mean they figured out some new,

2434
02:15:35,040 --> 02:15:38,670
it's like a spray on panel that you can,

2435
02:15:38,671 --> 02:15:42,840
they can take electricity from, from
the air spray on solar panels. Shut up.

2436
02:15:42,841 --> 02:15:46,350
Really? Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Amazing.
There's all kinds of new, is that every,

2437
02:15:46,351 --> 02:15:50,490
they're fully transparent solar cell that
could make every window and screen up

2438
02:15:50,491 --> 02:15:55,440
power source. Jesus fucking
Christ. That's amazing. I love it.

2439
02:15:55,620 --> 02:15:59,010
God Damn geniuses that
dance around amongst us.

2440
02:15:59,720 --> 02:16:04,590
We're mere apes. We are mere Abe's.
We were mere apes. We really are.

2441
02:16:04,591 --> 02:16:09,150
That someone figured out a way to make
glass power up your fucking TV. No,

2442
02:16:09,360 --> 02:16:10,920
I know.
I should have this conversation.

2443
02:16:10,921 --> 02:16:14,280
I've had these like
philosophical conversations
with Jank on our post game show

2444
02:16:14,281 --> 02:16:19,281
for our members and like I'm probably the
post like pessimistic self deprecating

2445
02:16:20,491 --> 02:16:23,730
person on the planet because oftentimes
in our post game shows I have like these

2446
02:16:23,731 --> 02:16:27,060
like quarter life crises where I talk
about how I'm a failure and how I haven't

2447
02:16:27,061 --> 02:16:30,100
done anything meaningful with my life.
I mean think about like you see stuff

2448
02:16:30,100 --> 02:16:30,611
like that.

2449
02:16:30,611 --> 02:16:34,120
You see these like astrophysicists and
these neuroscientists and all these

2450
02:16:34,121 --> 02:16:36,850
amazing intelligent people
and you're like, what do I do?

2451
02:16:36,851 --> 02:16:39,310
I just read the news and I comment on it.
You know,

2452
02:16:39,640 --> 02:16:42,250
and that sounds very self deprecating,
but it's true.

2453
02:16:42,251 --> 02:16:44,140
Like I wish I could do
something that actually changes.

2454
02:16:44,141 --> 02:16:47,250
It changes the world like that.
That actually saves the planet.

2455
02:16:47,370 --> 02:16:50,620
You want me to say that fucking egg head,
how to do your job. He would suck at it.

2456
02:16:50,660 --> 02:16:54,160
People always tell me not to make me feel
better, but what his legs looked like.

2457
02:16:54,161 --> 02:16:57,310
Shit, he's wearing a fucking
wearing your shoes. They don't fit.

2458
02:16:57,340 --> 02:16:59,680
If you put them in your job,
it would be terrible at it.

2459
02:17:00,040 --> 02:17:02,890
You've got to realize that like everybody
has their own little station in this

2460
02:17:02,891 --> 02:17:06,790
life. If you really true, if you
really treat life for what it is,

2461
02:17:06,791 --> 02:17:10,060
it's some sort of a weird experience.
You know, it's a temporary experience.

2462
02:17:10,330 --> 02:17:13,700
It lasts a long time relatively in your,
you know,

2463
02:17:13,710 --> 02:17:16,870
like in comparison to like
holding in your pee. Yeah.

2464
02:17:16,871 --> 02:17:19,480
You'll life lasts a long fucking time.

2465
02:17:19,481 --> 02:17:22,490
But the reality of it is it slips
away pretty God damn quickly. Yeah.

2466
02:17:22,570 --> 02:17:27,570
And the things that we dwell on our like
these markers of like achievement and

2467
02:17:28,001 --> 02:17:31,910
these like measures of success
and these, you know, the our,

2468
02:17:31,911 --> 02:17:35,590
our ability to measure ourselves against
the other people that were competing

2469
02:17:35,591 --> 02:17:38,870
with or some sort of a weird way,
but all that stuff is self defeating.

2470
02:17:39,120 --> 02:17:42,340
W we really need to do is find some
sort of a comfortable medium where we're

2471
02:17:42,341 --> 02:17:45,400
actually doing what we want
to do most of the time.

2472
02:17:45,401 --> 02:17:47,560
And obviously what you want
to do is what you're doing.

2473
02:17:48,340 --> 02:17:52,390
When if you were that fucking dude and
you're doing computations till three

2474
02:17:52,391 --> 02:17:54,720
o'clock in the morning
on some fucking glass,

2475
02:17:54,721 --> 02:17:57,880
it's going to make electricity and nobody
gives a shit what your shoes look like.

2476
02:17:58,090 --> 02:18:00,340
You'd be like, fuck this
job. This job sucks.

2477
02:18:00,820 --> 02:18:04,870
I'm tired of working 16 hours a day on
fucking stupid solar glass. I'm tired.

2478
02:18:04,871 --> 02:18:07,630
I'm tired. I want to be a
reporter. I want to be on TV.

2479
02:18:07,631 --> 02:18:12,340
I want to wear cute clothes. Come on. What
the fuck? All right, fair enough. Fair.

2480
02:18:12,650 --> 02:18:14,540
You wouldn't be happy.
You're happy with,

2481
02:18:15,000 --> 02:18:18,090
I love what I do. Don't get me wrong. I
love what I do. But every once in a while,

2482
02:18:18,091 --> 02:18:20,500
you know, you do, you do size people up,

2483
02:18:20,620 --> 02:18:23,340
right? Of will. Especially
because you're an educated,

2484
02:18:23,341 --> 02:18:25,200
successful woman who already,

2485
02:18:25,280 --> 02:18:27,420
you're already a little bit a little
bit of chip on your shoulder plus your

2486
02:18:27,421 --> 02:18:32,340
Armenian and then you're out there in
this competitive environment where in all

2487
02:18:32,341 --> 02:18:34,840
fairness, I think women have to, uh,

2488
02:18:34,950 --> 02:18:39,600
I feel they feel at least that they have
to prove themselves maybe even 10% more

2489
02:18:39,601 --> 02:18:44,130
than men who are just as competent
as them just to be accepted as like,

2490
02:18:44,131 --> 02:18:47,700
as at that same level because
men have this idea, oh,

2491
02:18:47,701 --> 02:18:50,670
she just wants to get pregnant and then
she's going to take paternity leave and

2492
02:18:50,671 --> 02:18:52,140
she's not serious about this job.

2493
02:18:52,141 --> 02:18:55,440
And there's a lot of people that have
those kind of prejudices about women in

2494
02:18:55,441 --> 02:18:59,580
the workforce. So you all automatically
have to get gangster on people. So you're,

2495
02:18:59,590 --> 02:19:01,980
you're,
you're always ramped up an extra 10%.

2496
02:19:02,080 --> 02:19:05,260
Yeah. There's also, there's also
this notion, and I don't know,

2497
02:19:05,290 --> 02:19:06,123
Chris is looking at me.

2498
02:19:06,360 --> 02:19:10,050
Nailed it. I know, I know. I got
you. I got you. I know. What's up.

2499
02:19:10,660 --> 02:19:15,660
There's also like this notion that like
an attractive woman can't be smart,

2500
02:19:16,030 --> 02:19:16,720
like rude,

2501
02:19:16,720 --> 02:19:20,350
like a comment that I get often and it's
a sweet comment and I love people that

2502
02:19:20,620 --> 02:19:24,160
send this to me, but I think that they're
a little misguided is like, oh yeah,

2503
02:19:24,161 --> 02:19:28,070
beauty and brains such a rarity. And
it's like, no, it's, it's not, it's

2504
02:19:28,070 --> 02:19:31,550
not a rarity and I want you to be dumber
because that way they can fuck you.

2505
02:19:31,850 --> 02:19:34,880
They can throw their, their tricks and
their Voodoo on you and they get fuck you.

2506
02:19:35,150 --> 02:19:38,780
But I think a year, one of the more
intelligent podcast guests that I have,

2507
02:19:38,781 --> 02:19:41,690
Rhonda, Patrick [inaudible] Patrick,
every time I got damn talk to her,

2508
02:19:41,691 --> 02:19:45,950
I don't know half the shit she's talking
about is this doctor Rhonda Patrick

2509
02:19:45,951 --> 02:19:48,950
who's a found my fitness on Twitter.
She's amazing.

2510
02:19:49,170 --> 02:19:53,720
And she comes on the podcast like every
few months and breaks down all sorts of

2511
02:19:53,721 --> 02:19:57,470
different issues between new
vitamin absorption in the
last one was head trauma.

2512
02:19:57,500 --> 02:20:01,520
Like she schooled me on head trauma
and the issues with head trauma,

2513
02:20:01,521 --> 02:20:06,200
like all the things that I kind
of like had she like in depth,

2514
02:20:06,201 --> 02:20:10,040
described them in great detail. And
like as she's talking like my, my,

2515
02:20:10,100 --> 02:20:14,020
I'm just trying to just keep up at
all at this certain point in time.

2516
02:20:14,020 --> 02:20:14,930
So I'm just tapping out on my,

2517
02:20:14,931 --> 02:20:18,500
I'm going to have to go over this after
it's over and take notes cause there's

2518
02:20:18,501 --> 02:20:21,530
no fucking way, cause she'll
go on, he's like 10 15 minutes.

2519
02:20:21,531 --> 02:20:23,090
Super Complicated rants.

2520
02:20:23,091 --> 02:20:25,880
Like I've talked to people on Twitter
that said they listened to that podcast

2521
02:20:25,881 --> 02:20:28,990
seven times. They just listened to
it over and over and over again.

2522
02:20:28,991 --> 02:20:33,991
Like what vitamin B complex is most
important for this and what it contributes

2523
02:20:34,101 --> 02:20:36,980
to what vitamin D contributes
to a muscle fiber growth.

2524
02:20:36,981 --> 02:20:39,530
And we're going to go and she hits you
with all this different shit and it's

2525
02:20:39,531 --> 02:20:42,350
like whoa. And she's
beautiful. So that's nonsense.

2526
02:20:42,351 --> 02:20:45,220
She's way fucking smarter than me.
There's a lot of, I mean it's, it's,

2527
02:20:45,310 --> 02:20:49,220
there's a lot of like really good
looking guys that are smart as fuck.

2528
02:20:49,400 --> 02:20:53,390
And for some dudes that's annoying as
shit. He said it's beautiful, handsome,

2529
02:20:53,391 --> 02:20:57,680
a Donna's character and you're like
that stupid fuck. Meanwhile, he's a phd,

2530
02:20:58,040 --> 02:21:01,070
like Vladimir Klitschko, the fucking
heavyweight champion of the world.

2531
02:21:01,100 --> 02:21:06,000
He's a doctor.
He's got a fucking phd,

2532
02:21:06,890 --> 02:21:09,790
six,
six and shredded.

2533
02:21:09,800 --> 02:21:14,540
He speaks four languages and it'll fuck
you up and nobody wants to believe that

2534
02:21:14,550 --> 02:21:16,880
you want to take. Oh, that fucking
meathead. Always a boxer. Yeah,

2535
02:21:16,890 --> 02:21:21,020
I bet he's real smart. He's way smarter
than you. He plays chess every day.

2536
02:21:21,170 --> 02:21:24,880
All right. He's, he's a fucking
world champion boxer for like tech.

2537
02:21:24,890 --> 02:21:28,100
Look at that handsome bastard. That's
the heavyweight champion of the world.

2538
02:21:28,101 --> 02:21:32,150
Get the fuck Outta here.
He's a super athlete from the future.

2539
02:21:32,300 --> 02:21:36,230
That's some Russian fucking engineering
shit that doesn't even make sense.

2540
02:21:36,440 --> 02:21:38,720
How tall is that dude? He's
like six, six or something.

2541
02:21:39,140 --> 02:21:41,860
You look just like that without
your shirt on. Christian. Oh,

2542
02:21:44,830 --> 02:21:46,760
this place got hot and heavy.

2543
02:21:48,110 --> 02:21:50,840
Six six two 40 Jesus fucking Christ.

2544
02:21:51,140 --> 02:21:53,150
Six six to 40 with a doctorate degree.

2545
02:21:53,210 --> 02:21:56,630
Nobody wants to admit that they want
to big fucking mood hood. That big fit.

2546
02:21:56,690 --> 02:22:00,140
He's way smarter than you
and I'll fuck you up. Sorry.

2547
02:22:00,390 --> 02:22:02,660
But you're probably better at PAC man.
Yeah,

2548
02:22:02,720 --> 02:22:05,390
I'm probably better at world of Warcraft.
You've probably got a higher rating.

2549
02:22:06,340 --> 02:22:08,690
It doesn't. You know like,
people are weird, man. We,

2550
02:22:08,691 --> 02:22:12,140
everybody wants it to be a goddamn race
from beginning to end. Enjoy your life.

2551
02:22:12,141 --> 02:22:14,810
Everybody gets a different hand of cards.
Do whatever the fuck you can with it.

2552
02:22:15,180 --> 02:22:17,960
Don't get crazy because it doesn't last.
It's just have some fun.

2553
02:22:17,990 --> 02:22:21,460
Tried to make it the most enjoyable.
That's six foot six fucking Adonis.

2554
02:22:21,560 --> 02:22:23,960
He might be miserable.
What do I, what do I know?

2555
02:22:24,050 --> 02:22:26,520
You know you might have a wife
screams at him. Throw shit out of him.

2556
02:22:26,830 --> 02:22:30,090
We don't know. You don't know
what his life is like. You know,

2557
02:22:30,330 --> 02:22:32,860
he might have shitty taste in music.
You might have like, you know,

2558
02:22:32,870 --> 02:22:35,970
you might fucking be listening to
terrible music all day and you're like,

2559
02:22:36,030 --> 02:22:40,240
I hate him. I don't want to beat
him. We're weird. We're weird. We,

2560
02:22:40,650 --> 02:22:44,160
we compare like you're comparing yourself
to the solar glass people. I'm like,

2561
02:22:44,161 --> 02:22:48,080
thank God those egg heads are out there.
Much love to you.

2562
02:22:48,630 --> 02:22:50,910
Tweet something, Holler
at me. I help you out.

2563
02:22:52,230 --> 02:22:54,330
As long as you're doing
something you enjoy,

2564
02:22:54,331 --> 02:22:56,880
as long as you're surrounded by
people that you love, you got to,

2565
02:22:56,910 --> 02:22:58,560
you got to enjoy the moment a little bit.

2566
02:22:58,650 --> 02:23:02,970
Which is what he tells me all the time
with Cubans don't have to rocket. Oh yeah,

2567
02:23:02,971 --> 02:23:05,760
they do. They do Cuban.
That's a, that's a fun.

2568
02:23:05,790 --> 02:23:09,880
Like Joey Dee is my favorite human being
of all time. He's born in Cuba. He's,

2569
02:23:10,310 --> 02:23:14,430
he knows. They just, there's a different
flair to the Latin cultures they have.

2570
02:23:14,580 --> 02:23:18,640
They have more fun. Like
we're, we get more shit done.
We do, we get more shit done,

2571
02:23:19,560 --> 02:23:20,550
but what do you want?

2572
02:23:20,551 --> 02:23:22,590
Do you want to get more shit done
or do you want to have more fun?

2573
02:23:22,591 --> 02:23:24,720
And it becomes like this
balancing act of man.

2574
02:23:24,721 --> 02:23:26,800
I don't know because like you said,

2575
02:23:26,860 --> 02:23:30,480
like people that are the most happy in
the world. I did this some sort of a,

2576
02:23:30,481 --> 02:23:34,940
you know, an index of most happy
countries. Mexico was pretty fucking high.

2577
02:23:35,020 --> 02:23:39,500
I'm very surprised about that really was,
especially in good time,

2578
02:23:40,200 --> 02:23:43,010
good for them, good
for them. You know, we,

2579
02:23:43,011 --> 02:23:47,970
we are caught up in this idea
that unless you're keeping tabs,

2580
02:23:48,150 --> 02:23:51,690
unless you're numbers are ahead of their
numbers or your position or your social

2581
02:23:51,840 --> 02:23:55,550
caste systems ahead, then you shouldn't
be happy. But it's so stupid. Like,

2582
02:23:55,560 --> 02:23:59,250
you know what? You need happiness friends,
hanging around with a bunch of friends,

2583
02:23:59,430 --> 02:24:03,270
have a good time, do stuff that you
like. That's it. Be Nice to each other.

2584
02:24:03,510 --> 02:24:07,320
You'll get more friends. Be Nice to
those friends. There'll be loyal to you.

2585
02:24:07,321 --> 02:24:10,350
You'll be loyal to them, your brothers
and sisters. You stay together forever.

2586
02:24:10,530 --> 02:24:13,170
Everybody's cool. It's all you have
to do is you find a gang of friends.

2587
02:24:13,171 --> 02:24:17,010
He collect friends that are cool and
you enforce your love for them and they

2588
02:24:17,011 --> 02:24:19,950
enforce their love for you and you
shield yourself from the outside world by

2589
02:24:19,951 --> 02:24:23,220
forming these pockets and communities
of awesome people that can be done,

2590
02:24:23,580 --> 02:24:25,950
that can be done, but it can't
be done if you're fucking king.

2591
02:24:25,951 --> 02:24:30,951
Shit real estate mogul once a fuck over
your partners and your investors and

2592
02:24:31,210 --> 02:24:36,210
you're just trying to pump and dump stocks
and fuck you like the guy in wolf of

2593
02:24:36,211 --> 02:24:40,560
Wall Street. Like that sort of crazy
mentality. Capitalism above all costs,

2594
02:24:40,561 --> 02:24:44,190
like you're missing out on the
balancing act of life. You're just,

2595
02:24:44,340 --> 02:24:45,120
you're an asshole.

2596
02:24:45,120 --> 02:24:48,390
You're a guy who thinks he's gonna run
the marathon by running as fast as you

2597
02:24:48,391 --> 02:24:51,960
can right from the beginning. No
one's, no one's ever thought of that.

2598
02:24:52,230 --> 02:24:54,300
Everybody started that stupid.
You can't do that.

2599
02:24:54,450 --> 02:24:58,020
You can't sprint for three hours.
You fuckhead. It's not possible.

2600
02:24:58,021 --> 02:25:00,840
Everyone knows by now.
So when you're doing that,

2601
02:25:00,841 --> 02:25:03,720
what you're really doing
is you're sprinting you're
way through the beginning,

2602
02:25:03,990 --> 02:25:08,040
couple miles of a marathon to fucking die.
That's what you're doing.

2603
02:25:08,041 --> 02:25:09,780
You're treating life like a moron.

2604
02:25:09,810 --> 02:25:13,200
This is better than any therapy
session I've ever had. This is great.

2605
02:25:13,260 --> 02:25:16,470
I feel better about life.
I did too. I do too.

2606
02:25:16,471 --> 02:25:20,970
It's coming out of me and I feel better
about it, but that's what you know.

2607
02:25:20,971 --> 02:25:23,230
I mean, and everybody says like,
you know, hey me, you know,

2608
02:25:23,231 --> 02:25:26,470
that's easy for you or I can't afford it.
Without a doubt,

2609
02:25:26,500 --> 02:25:29,410
everyone has different circumstances,
but without a doubt,

2610
02:25:29,411 --> 02:25:33,250
every circumstances could
be managed more optimally.

2611
02:25:33,460 --> 02:25:35,380
Every single one that's ever existed,

2612
02:25:35,590 --> 02:25:37,720
we're flawed and we
learned from our mistakes,

2613
02:25:37,721 --> 02:25:42,070
which means everyone approaches every
single situation in their life where

2614
02:25:42,071 --> 02:25:46,360
you're just kind of basing it off of
the information that you've acquired,

2615
02:25:46,361 --> 02:25:48,040
the knowledge that you've gathered,

2616
02:25:48,041 --> 02:25:51,250
the experience that you've
sorta calculated in your brain,

2617
02:25:51,251 --> 02:25:53,620
and this is how I think,
and then if it goes fucking Shitty,

2618
02:25:53,621 --> 02:25:55,720
like your cop situation,
yeah, you go, well,

2619
02:25:55,721 --> 02:25:59,560
now I got some fucking new shit in here
and the next mother fucker the tries

2620
02:25:59,561 --> 02:26:01,990
that nonsense. Yeah. I'm,
I'm asking questions,

2621
02:26:01,991 --> 02:26:05,650
I'm writing things down and I'm making
a fucking story and I'm making a fucking

2622
02:26:05,651 --> 02:26:09,430
difference. That's the difference. That's
what happens with us. We grow and learn.

2623
02:26:09,431 --> 02:26:10,990
I mean, that's, that's
what it's all about.

2624
02:26:11,300 --> 02:26:13,940
Yeah. Yeah, absolutely.
There's no question about it.

2625
02:26:13,970 --> 02:26:17,300
I would say like the happiest
moments of my life. We're not.

2626
02:26:17,301 --> 02:26:21,770
When I was sitting there competing with
other people or trying to achieve more

2627
02:26:21,771 --> 02:26:22,371
in my career,

2628
02:26:22,371 --> 02:26:26,630
it was definitely moments where I traveled
somewhere with a really good friend

2629
02:26:26,660 --> 02:26:31,550
moments where I've, you know, shared
like a really great meal with a coworker.

2630
02:26:31,730 --> 02:26:36,430
Like those are the things that are more
memorable and I think that my generation

2631
02:26:36,431 --> 02:26:40,550
is moving away from like the
obsession of owning big things, right?

2632
02:26:40,551 --> 02:26:44,510
Like less people in my generation are
buying homes partly because they can't do

2633
02:26:44,511 --> 02:26:46,340
it because they're straddled
with student loan debt,

2634
02:26:46,580 --> 02:26:49,610
but also because they don't want
to be tied down to one place.

2635
02:26:49,640 --> 02:26:53,840
They want to go see the world, they want
to go experience things. And so, you know,

2636
02:26:53,841 --> 02:26:56,330
we talked about this a little bit
the first time I was on your podcast,

2637
02:26:56,570 --> 02:26:59,660
but sometimes I struggle with that
too, right? Sometimes I'm like, yeah,

2638
02:26:59,661 --> 02:27:01,250
I want to buy a big house.

2639
02:27:01,550 --> 02:27:04,400
And then other times I'm like looking at
my quaint little apartment and I'm like,

2640
02:27:04,460 --> 02:27:05,271
this is fine.

2641
02:27:05,271 --> 02:27:08,450
I'd rather have some money saved in the
bank to go on some cool trip and like

2642
02:27:08,480 --> 02:27:10,430
meet people and learn new things.

2643
02:27:10,490 --> 02:27:14,660
If I was Joey Diaz right now I go
on a rant about fuck that shit.

2644
02:27:14,661 --> 02:27:19,661
You getting paid need a fucking big crib
with pillars like Elvis had marble shit

2645
02:27:19,701 --> 02:27:20,810
like they had in Greece.

2646
02:27:20,990 --> 02:27:23,150
What the fuck you told me you gotta
keep your money in the bank and those

2647
02:27:23,151 --> 02:27:26,330
fucking people going to steal it on.
You get the fuck Outta here.

2648
02:27:26,331 --> 02:27:31,280
You want a Bentley and a fucking jet and
a helicopter and missile launchers and

2649
02:27:31,281 --> 02:27:35,300
a fucking pool your face on the bottom
of it. That's what Joey d is it say.

2650
02:27:35,840 --> 02:27:37,790
And I agree with him.
You're making a lot of money.

2651
02:27:37,791 --> 02:27:40,280
You should fucking spend that shit.
Fuck a one bedroom apartment.

2652
02:27:41,340 --> 02:27:42,280
Hello.

2653
02:27:43,540 --> 02:27:46,720
But yeah, you just have fun.
It's, it's hard for people to do.

2654
02:27:46,780 --> 02:27:50,500
Sorry people we quantify too much.
We do quantify our lives too much.

2655
02:27:51,330 --> 02:27:54,220
You know, question. But you know,

2656
02:27:54,430 --> 02:27:58,510
I think there's one thing that if I
could ever give, especially men advice,

2657
02:27:59,470 --> 02:28:03,580
healthy friendly competition,
that is the difference.

2658
02:28:03,790 --> 02:28:07,570
The real problem that people have with
competition is, is very self defeating.

2659
02:28:07,780 --> 02:28:12,780
And a lot of times losing at things is
insanely frustrating and it makes men

2660
02:28:13,150 --> 02:28:16,930
especially angry.
And this is a trap and this is a trap.

2661
02:28:17,140 --> 02:28:21,920
And it's essentially a non management of
a biological system that's put in place

2662
02:28:21,921 --> 02:28:26,510
to allow you to try to rise to the highest
possible spot and the social spectrum

2663
02:28:26,630 --> 02:28:27,470
for you to breed.

2664
02:28:27,740 --> 02:28:31,370
And it's a trick and that trick is in
place and it can fuck men up so they can

2665
02:28:31,371 --> 02:28:34,580
get angry at their best friends.
If they're playing pickup basketball,

2666
02:28:34,810 --> 02:28:38,780
they can get to a point where they want
to have fistfights over basketball and

2667
02:28:38,900 --> 02:28:41,270
men.
But if they didn't,

2668
02:28:41,300 --> 02:28:45,530
if the exact same thing happen and they
still experienced the heightened sense

2669
02:28:45,531 --> 02:28:46,520
of competitiveness,

2670
02:28:46,610 --> 02:28:50,990
but always with friendship and love
for the person you're competing with,

2671
02:28:51,140 --> 02:28:52,640
you can have better results.

2672
02:28:52,730 --> 02:28:54,770
You can have better results because
you're still gonna have that same

2673
02:28:54,771 --> 02:28:57,500
competitive drive, but you never
allow yourself to hate the opponent.

2674
02:28:57,860 --> 02:29:00,740
You waste energy. In fact,
when you hate the opponent,

2675
02:29:00,790 --> 02:29:03,790
I think, I mean, I don't know
if this is the same for men,

2676
02:29:03,820 --> 02:29:07,960
but whenever I meet a woman who's super
accomplished and I feel a little bit of

2677
02:29:07,961 --> 02:29:11,870
envy,
I actually just picks you turn green.

2678
02:29:12,730 --> 02:29:14,260
I know, right? No,

2679
02:29:14,261 --> 02:29:18,430
I actually use that as more
of an inspirational thing
as opposed to like, oh,

2680
02:29:18,431 --> 02:29:21,700
I hate her and now I'm going to like tear
her down and try to find her fault so

2681
02:29:21,701 --> 02:29:24,100
I could feel better about,
feel better about myself.

2682
02:29:24,460 --> 02:29:28,360
I love meeting really successful women
that shake me out of my complacency

2683
02:29:28,361 --> 02:29:33,280
because as humans we love
to be complacent. Whether
or not we are aware of it,

2684
02:29:33,510 --> 02:29:37,120
we kind of like slide into
that, you know, comfort zone.

2685
02:29:37,390 --> 02:29:40,840
And so I like it when I meet a
woman who's like smarter than me,

2686
02:29:40,841 --> 02:29:43,810
more successful than me and subtle
like hating on her. I'll be like,

2687
02:29:43,811 --> 02:29:48,280
what can I do to be like her
or better than yes. Yeah,

2688
02:29:48,400 --> 02:29:51,970
that's healthy. That's very healthy. And
being inspired by people that you meet,

2689
02:29:51,971 --> 02:29:55,450
especially people that are doing like
what you're doing for a living or what

2690
02:29:55,451 --> 02:29:58,330
you're doing or for a hobby or anything
that you, you know, any pursuit,

2691
02:29:58,480 --> 02:30:00,710
whether it money's
involved in art, um, Eh,

2692
02:30:00,790 --> 02:30:05,520
they can be incredibly empowering
tor or defeating and with,

2693
02:30:05,530 --> 02:30:10,530
with men especially men have a real
issue in denial of the actual competitive

2694
02:30:10,871 --> 02:30:12,100
nature of the scenario.

2695
02:30:12,340 --> 02:30:16,740
Like there's some men that they have
this idea of what they look like and the,

2696
02:30:16,900 --> 02:30:20,520
this idea of what a bad mother fucker
they are and how cool they are now front

2697
02:30:20,521 --> 02:30:23,200
of the Ark and the rest of the world
has a completely different opinion. Yup.

2698
02:30:23,230 --> 02:30:24,040
And they don't,

2699
02:30:24,040 --> 02:30:28,390
they don't ever allow themselves to see
what they're doing wrong because then it

2700
02:30:28,391 --> 02:30:33,190
chips away at this armor that they've put
on this armor being this false opinion

2701
02:30:33,191 --> 02:30:37,600
of themselves and they go out of their
way to make sure that's never exposed

2702
02:30:37,601 --> 02:30:38,560
through trial.

2703
02:30:38,770 --> 02:30:43,510
And that's what one of the things that
separates people who do difficult things.

2704
02:30:43,511 --> 02:30:45,400
Anything that's really hard to do.

2705
02:30:45,401 --> 02:30:49,090
I think in doing something that's very
difficult, whether it's, you know,

2706
02:30:49,091 --> 02:30:53,740
running fucking marathons or climbing
mountains or martial arts or anything

2707
02:30:53,750 --> 02:30:57,880
you're doing, it's hard to do. You learn
about your ability to push yourself.

2708
02:30:57,881 --> 02:31:00,220
You learn how to overcome obstacles.

2709
02:31:00,510 --> 02:31:05,020
You learn about yourself in a way that
people that are sort of in denial about

2710
02:31:05,021 --> 02:31:08,230
where their standing as far as how
good they are at anything. You know,

2711
02:31:08,231 --> 02:31:10,420
there's some people that think through
the shit, they don't even have a job.

2712
02:31:10,670 --> 02:31:12,640
But yeah, Bro, I'm shit
falls working there.

2713
02:31:12,641 --> 02:31:14,860
I'd be fucking running
things Balsa president ma,

2714
02:31:15,060 --> 02:31:17,650
but fuck off till Russia
to suck my Dick Man,

2715
02:31:19,910 --> 02:31:22,230
new Pabst blue ribbon gets opened.
You know,

2716
02:31:22,240 --> 02:31:24,720
there's a lot of people that
think they're fucking awesome,

2717
02:31:24,810 --> 02:31:26,370
but if you peered in on them,
you know,

2718
02:31:26,371 --> 02:31:29,940
if you had a window into their trailer
and you saw their fucking no dirty socks

2719
02:31:29,941 --> 02:31:32,520
and their foot's kicked up on the
couch, you'd be like, Oh my God,

2720
02:31:32,521 --> 02:31:35,250
you fucking idiot.
You don't know how the world sees you.

2721
02:31:35,640 --> 02:31:39,300
And for men especially,
it's like the,

2722
02:31:39,330 --> 02:31:43,800
the need to be little competition is
a very dangerous thing. You know, the,

2723
02:31:43,850 --> 02:31:48,680
the need to not be empowered by people
that are better that you see around you.

2724
02:31:48,681 --> 02:31:49,201
Cause when you,

2725
02:31:49,201 --> 02:31:52,260
when you see them and you embrace
and you have no hate in your heart,

2726
02:31:52,440 --> 02:31:55,140
then you can actually be empowered
and it'll actually make you better at

2727
02:31:55,141 --> 02:31:55,970
whatever you do.

2728
02:31:55,970 --> 02:31:59,270
Yeah, absolutely. You got to learn
from people around you. You know,

2729
02:31:59,271 --> 02:32:02,120
you got to learn from the mistakes
that people make around you.

2730
02:32:02,121 --> 02:32:04,820
You got to learn from the people who are
doing things that are better than what

2731
02:32:04,821 --> 02:32:06,590
you're doing and,
and don't,

2732
02:32:07,280 --> 02:32:11,000
my tendency is to feel down
about myself time to time.

2733
02:32:11,001 --> 02:32:12,770
I don't end up hating the
person who's better than me.

2734
02:32:12,771 --> 02:32:16,700
I start like being very critical,
overly critical of myself.

2735
02:32:16,701 --> 02:32:20,690
Like don't let that happen either because
that's very destructive. Yeah. Um,

2736
02:32:20,840 --> 02:32:21,291
but yeah,

2737
02:32:21,291 --> 02:32:24,590
like I'm lucky that I work in a field
where I'm exposed to super intelligent

2738
02:32:24,591 --> 02:32:26,930
people on a regular basis. Like, you know,

2739
02:32:26,960 --> 02:32:29,110
I don't agree with everything
that Jank says. Uh,

2740
02:32:29,120 --> 02:32:31,370
we have differences of
opinion in a lot of it.

2741
02:32:31,470 --> 02:32:34,030
They think that and I'm going to edit it
and I'm going to send it to them right

2742
02:32:34,031 --> 02:32:35,740
now,
motherfucker.

2743
02:32:35,970 --> 02:32:38,250
Um, but Genx, my mentor, you know,

2744
02:32:38,251 --> 02:32:42,990
I learned a lot from him and I'm so
grateful that I was able to like grow next

2745
02:32:42,991 --> 02:32:44,700
to him and learn a lot of stuff.

2746
02:32:44,701 --> 02:32:48,120
And he also built a company that
expanded to the point where we're,

2747
02:32:48,180 --> 02:32:51,180
we have a steady flow of intelligent
people coming in all the time.

2748
02:32:51,181 --> 02:32:55,260
We have these great conversations. I'm
always learning new things. I love that.

2749
02:32:55,261 --> 02:32:57,510
I have a job where I get to learn
new things. You get that too.

2750
02:32:57,511 --> 02:33:01,290
And it's awesome where you know,
you guys have a dope office to you.

2751
02:33:01,440 --> 02:33:04,740
Like this is a corporation.
You guys are a corporation,

2752
02:33:04,770 --> 02:33:06,060
you have a fucking staff dude.

2753
02:33:06,061 --> 02:33:09,300
It wasn't always like that or workstations
and everyone's friendly though.

2754
02:33:09,330 --> 02:33:13,680
It's very nice people super fast with
you by the way, when you came in.

2755
02:33:13,681 --> 02:33:15,480
Not like in a creepy way.
Um,

2756
02:33:15,481 --> 02:33:18,300
so I'm going to give him a shout out
because he's a big fan and he's like,

2757
02:33:18,301 --> 02:33:19,480
well listening right now.
Um,

2758
02:33:19,660 --> 02:33:23,820
how Hassan who's actually genx nephew
is like such a big fan of yours.

2759
02:33:23,821 --> 02:33:26,730
And he was like, oh, Joe, Joe's going
to be at the Improv. Like I gotta go,

2760
02:33:26,731 --> 02:33:27,640
I gotta go see Joe.

2761
02:33:27,660 --> 02:33:30,570
And then I noticed that like as soon as
he saw you walking through the studio,

2762
02:33:30,571 --> 02:33:32,870
he wanted to take a picture with you.
And I was like, oh my God, how's,

2763
02:33:32,871 --> 02:33:34,080
you're so embarrassing.
Please stop.

2764
02:33:34,160 --> 02:33:37,070
Oh, that's all right. He's a person
so it doesn't embarrass me. It's fine.

2765
02:33:37,670 --> 02:33:42,320
So shout out to Hassan. Yes. No, you
guys have like a real corporation.

2766
02:33:42,321 --> 02:33:44,660
Like you go in there, it feels like you
know what you're doing. You go in here.

2767
02:33:44,661 --> 02:33:49,040
If Jamie died, I'd be fucked.
Bring Brian in here every day.

2768
02:33:49,041 --> 02:33:50,490
Be a disaster again.
Huh?

2769
02:33:50,690 --> 02:33:53,990
Okay. How is Brian? He
doesn't, he's not here yet.

2770
02:33:54,070 --> 02:33:56,970
Well, if sums podcasts, he
doesn't do it. Oh, I see.

2771
02:33:56,980 --> 02:34:01,900
He does ones that I feel like he
would be best suited for. I see.

2772
02:34:02,140 --> 02:34:05,560
I see. Okay. If that
makes sense. I think too,

2773
02:34:05,561 --> 02:34:08,800
you can only do so many podcasts with
the same person over and over again.

2774
02:34:08,860 --> 02:34:10,420
You know, I think, I think, uh,

2775
02:34:10,490 --> 02:34:14,350
one of the things about doing
podcasts is you've got to do what?

2776
02:34:14,410 --> 02:34:16,990
Like you gotta talk to the people you
want to talk to have the conference.

2777
02:34:17,180 --> 02:34:18,610
You've got to do it
when you want to do it.

2778
02:34:18,611 --> 02:34:21,970
Like that's the whole idea behind
it to me is that, you know,

2779
02:34:21,971 --> 02:34:23,560
there is no set schedule.

2780
02:34:23,561 --> 02:34:28,240
There is no employer that's telling me
what I can and can't talk about gas than

2781
02:34:28,241 --> 02:34:31,870
I'm being forced to interview. Right.
That's the worst. That's the worst. Yeah.

2782
02:34:31,871 --> 02:34:35,410
The cool thing about it too is that
it's now podcasting has become something

2783
02:34:35,411 --> 02:34:36,280
that people are willing to do.

2784
02:34:36,281 --> 02:34:40,210
Like I had Paul Stanley from kiss
on this this year and I was like,

2785
02:34:40,211 --> 02:34:41,320
you gotta get the Fuck Outta here.

2786
02:34:41,321 --> 02:34:44,710
I can't believe I got Paul Stanley
sitting here. I was such a little fan boy.

2787
02:34:44,890 --> 02:34:47,020
Yeah.
Such a little fan with Joe Perry,

2788
02:34:47,050 --> 02:34:49,570
Joe Perry's my friend Joe
Perry from Aerosmith. I'm like,

2789
02:34:49,571 --> 02:34:50,740
this is my friend Joe Perry.

2790
02:34:53,240 --> 02:34:57,310
You have to give yourself some credit
though because you do a three hour long

2791
02:34:57,311 --> 02:35:00,850
podcast in the middle of nowhere La wise.
It's not hard to do.

2792
02:35:01,750 --> 02:35:05,110
It's not, it's not. But it's intimidating
if you haven't done it before.

2793
02:35:05,111 --> 02:35:08,830
So before I came into the first podcast
with you, I was definitely nervous.

2794
02:35:08,831 --> 02:35:10,570
I'm like, oh my God, three hours.

2795
02:35:10,571 --> 02:35:13,150
Like what are we going to talk about
for three freaking hours straight,

2796
02:35:13,450 --> 02:35:17,440
no breaks, no nothing. Right? Um, so
the fact that you know, these big name,

2797
02:35:17,441 --> 02:35:19,660
people are willing, not
me, but like, uh, you know,

2798
02:35:19,661 --> 02:35:22,600
the people you mentioned earlier are
willing to come in and sit down with you

2799
02:35:22,601 --> 02:35:25,830
for three hours. That that means that
you've, you've made it my friend.

2800
02:35:25,940 --> 02:35:26,900
I don't even know what that means,

2801
02:35:26,901 --> 02:35:29,480
but it's pretty cool to be able to
talk to Rosanne bar for three hours.

2802
02:35:29,540 --> 02:35:31,370
Roseanne Barr isn't awesome.
Roseanne,

2803
02:35:31,371 --> 02:35:34,820
Paul has given me a hard time the other
day because we had this show on. And uh,

2804
02:35:34,821 --> 02:35:38,720
there was uh, no chicks and the show
and I said that I secretly, she goes,

2805
02:35:38,721 --> 02:35:41,570
what the hell? No women on the show
at all. Question Mark. And I said,

2806
02:35:41,770 --> 02:35:44,810
I secretly made no women on the show,
just cause I knew you would complain.

2807
02:35:44,930 --> 02:35:48,930
Success, that's fine.
And then she said, well,

2808
02:35:48,980 --> 02:35:50,120
you know something to the lines of,

2809
02:35:50,121 --> 02:35:52,940
you're on the show that I guess a
chick is on the show. And I said, well,

2810
02:35:52,941 --> 02:35:57,650
if you're calling me a chicken, you're a
check. That's a compliment. She's great.

2811
02:35:57,680 --> 02:36:00,830
She's awesome. She's so crazy.
She is. She's in my opinion,

2812
02:36:01,060 --> 02:36:03,650
one of the all time great comics.
Like she doesn't get a,

2813
02:36:03,651 --> 02:36:07,190
and I told her that when she was in the
studio, like if I had a list of 10 time,

2814
02:36:07,310 --> 02:36:12,050
uh, you know, top 10, like mo most
important comics in my opinion,

2815
02:36:12,051 --> 02:36:14,930
she,
she became a totally unique and new thing.

2816
02:36:15,200 --> 02:36:17,090
Like when she burst onto the scene,

2817
02:36:17,091 --> 02:36:19,910
she was like murder in it
and doing these HBO specials,

2818
02:36:20,080 --> 02:36:24,050
they had never been a woman like her
before telling men to suck it shot up.

2819
02:36:24,080 --> 02:36:27,830
You know, she had this like fucking
attitude with good joke writing.

2820
02:36:27,860 --> 02:36:31,100
Like that attitude plus good
joke writing and a genuine,

2821
02:36:31,340 --> 02:36:35,570
not give a fuck outlook on things.
Yeah. And now when she talks,

2822
02:36:35,571 --> 02:36:38,570
it was really funny because she talks
about her life. She's super honest,

2823
02:36:38,780 --> 02:36:42,420
but I'll crazy and off the rails.
She was awesome.

2824
02:36:43,130 --> 02:36:43,963
She's the best.

2825
02:36:44,030 --> 02:36:46,100
A really good friend of mine,
Dave Ruben,

2826
02:36:46,520 --> 02:36:50,240
who also does a show for our network is
very good friends with Roseanne and she

2827
02:36:50,241 --> 02:36:52,340
apparently has like a TV studio like that.

2828
02:36:52,341 --> 02:36:57,341
She built herself and he's now like doing
some shows like out of her TV studio.

2829
02:36:58,090 --> 02:37:02,150
Um, and like I've heard stories about how
freaking awesome she is and I love it.

2830
02:37:02,151 --> 02:37:06,170
I love how open she is and I don't know,
she's a lot of,

2831
02:37:06,171 --> 02:37:07,620
I've met her a few times too.
She's great.

2832
02:37:07,930 --> 02:37:10,450
She's out. And she also
is not dogmatic, you know,

2833
02:37:10,451 --> 02:37:14,710
she had this idea about chem trails all,
they're spraying things in the sky,

2834
02:37:14,960 --> 02:37:18,620
you know, and I, and we
had this conversation about
it and I said that's not,

2835
02:37:18,650 --> 02:37:20,510
they're not really doing that.
That's not what's happening.

2836
02:37:20,511 --> 02:37:21,860
I'll tell you exactly what's happening.

2837
02:37:21,861 --> 02:37:24,740
Cause we investigated it and there's
a lot of people to believe that,

2838
02:37:24,741 --> 02:37:25,940
but they really haven't looked into it.

2839
02:37:25,970 --> 02:37:29,810
It's scientifically been proven that
when a jet engine goes through the

2840
02:37:29,811 --> 02:37:32,780
atmosphere, it was a certain temperature
and a certain amount of condensation.

2841
02:37:32,781 --> 02:37:34,860
It actually produces artificial clouds.
Yeah.

2842
02:37:34,940 --> 02:37:36,560
It's a very scientific
principle behind it.

2843
02:37:36,561 --> 02:37:39,650
It's really easy to understand and
you see it explained and go, oh,

2844
02:37:39,651 --> 02:37:41,480
that's what it is. And so
they're always like, well,

2845
02:37:41,481 --> 02:37:44,170
why is it always in grid pattern? Like
I had a guy on the podcast and like us,

2846
02:37:44,171 --> 02:37:47,900
that's what flights do. They go the same
way every day. It's a flight pattern.

2847
02:37:48,010 --> 02:37:51,170
You think planes just take off
like a boat out in the ocean.

2848
02:37:51,171 --> 02:37:53,770
Just any fucking path they want. You
know, like you've got to fucking sailboat.

2849
02:37:53,900 --> 02:37:55,610
You just left and right.
No,

2850
02:37:55,611 --> 02:37:58,700
you don't have to go exactly where they
tell you to otherwise just slamming each

2851
02:37:58,701 --> 02:38:02,750
other. You fuck, you know, like
so, but when I told her this,

2852
02:38:02,900 --> 02:38:06,800
she sort of went, oh, okay.
Like she, like she didn't,

2853
02:38:07,280 --> 02:38:09,080
she didn't get crazy red in the face.

2854
02:38:10,030 --> 02:38:10,460
Right.

2855
02:38:10,460 --> 02:38:15,460
I heard that is such an admirable
quality in people because when someone's

2856
02:38:17,090 --> 02:38:19,940
pointing to something you just said and
they were like, no, it's actually wrong.

2857
02:38:19,941 --> 02:38:24,160
Here's what the reality is. I mean,
I think the human and, and you know,

2858
02:38:24,230 --> 02:38:27,470
understandable reaction is to
like try to defend yourself. Yeah.

2859
02:38:27,560 --> 02:38:31,070
Even though you know you're wrong and
it's like the best feeling when you

2860
02:38:31,071 --> 02:38:33,410
finally just like recognize
like, oh, I'm wrong.

2861
02:38:33,500 --> 02:38:36,380
I'm just going to admit that I'm wrong
and an do more research into it and

2862
02:38:36,381 --> 02:38:39,880
figure it out. You know what I mean? I
think that's more admirable than like, no,

2863
02:38:39,881 --> 02:38:40,701
I'm gonna defend myself.

2864
02:38:40,701 --> 02:38:43,160
Even though you have evidence proving
that what I've just said is bullshit.

2865
02:38:43,710 --> 02:38:47,610
Well, I think people are learning
now in this day and age that it's,

2866
02:38:48,090 --> 02:38:52,150
there's really no benefit in
pretending you're never wrong. Yeah.

2867
02:38:52,410 --> 02:38:54,880
Especially when it comes to
things that are like you.

2868
02:38:54,930 --> 02:38:58,380
No one has all the information.
Exactly. You can't.

2869
02:38:58,470 --> 02:39:00,000
There's too much going on in the world.

2870
02:39:00,060 --> 02:39:02,520
You know everything about aviation
do everything about viruses.

2871
02:39:02,521 --> 02:39:05,310
You know everything about computer codes.
You know everything about Portuguese.

2872
02:39:05,490 --> 02:39:08,820
You can't, there's too much shit. You
don't have enough time in the day. Yeah.

2873
02:39:08,830 --> 02:39:10,610
So you might have a
misconception in your mind,

2874
02:39:10,630 --> 02:39:13,140
doesn't mean you're a fucking idiot.
It means you were wrong.

2875
02:39:13,290 --> 02:39:16,080
You're a fucking idiot if
you continue to cling to it,

2876
02:39:16,230 --> 02:39:19,890
even while it's being explained
to you that it's not correct.

2877
02:39:20,010 --> 02:39:23,400
That's what makes you a fucking idiot.
And unfortunately, especially for men,

2878
02:39:23,401 --> 02:39:25,770
again,
we cling to ideas.

2879
02:39:25,771 --> 02:39:29,070
We don't want to ever say we were wrong
because then we give up this position of

2880
02:39:29,071 --> 02:39:32,840
being smarter. Right? This position
of being better or winning.

2881
02:39:33,500 --> 02:39:37,820
Yeah. I, Kevin Pereira said something
to me that I loved and it's so true.

2882
02:39:37,821 --> 02:39:42,800
He's like, what's wrong with saying I
don't know, time to time. So you know,

2883
02:39:42,990 --> 02:39:46,190
and and it's true.
Like there's like this fear,

2884
02:39:46,191 --> 02:39:49,730
especially when you do an interview with
someone or when you come on a podcast

2885
02:39:50,000 --> 02:39:52,400
that someone's going to ask you something
that you don't know the answer to and

2886
02:39:52,401 --> 02:39:53,990
then you have to utter the words.

2887
02:39:54,020 --> 02:39:58,520
I don't know because you're going to
get criticism for it, but like why?

2888
02:39:58,760 --> 02:40:02,180
It's not like I know everything
that there is to know. That's crazy.

2889
02:40:02,390 --> 02:40:05,450
Those two percents out there
counting it up. That's what it is.

2890
02:40:05,720 --> 02:40:07,730
Those are the ones who are
going to complain because
those are the ones who are

2891
02:40:07,731 --> 02:40:11,360
not going to know. Of course, you
can't know everything. She goes,

2892
02:40:11,361 --> 02:40:13,040
I can't believe you.
Just know what the Balton island.

2893
02:40:14,630 --> 02:40:17,640
Just always going to be someone
he's going to be that problem.

2894
02:40:17,970 --> 02:40:19,140
And you know there's,

2895
02:40:19,170 --> 02:40:22,050
there's a lot of people that are out
there and they pretend that this never

2896
02:40:22,051 --> 02:40:23,040
comes up in their life.

2897
02:40:23,041 --> 02:40:25,200
Why don't you just talk about
things and I'm not aware of,

2898
02:40:25,230 --> 02:40:27,120
of course you do stupid,
have a contact,

2899
02:40:27,670 --> 02:40:29,820
have a conversation with
someone you don't know.

2900
02:40:29,960 --> 02:40:32,070
You just start talking to you about
some shit you don't know about.

2901
02:40:32,280 --> 02:40:34,440
You know someone from somewhere else.
So it's a different kind of life.

2902
02:40:34,441 --> 02:40:36,480
You couldn't possibly know what they know.
Exactly.

2903
02:40:36,510 --> 02:40:39,060
No one can know everything and
it doesn't mean you're dumb.

2904
02:40:39,180 --> 02:40:44,180
And that's the problem is that in small
social circles or especially where the

2905
02:40:44,281 --> 02:40:47,280
instinct probably comes
from tribal situations,

2906
02:40:47,640 --> 02:40:50,220
you all have access to
the same amount of data.

2907
02:40:50,221 --> 02:40:53,160
The one who knows more is
the one who's more wise.

2908
02:40:53,330 --> 02:40:56,280
It was the one who paid more attention
or the one who has more experience or

2909
02:40:56,281 --> 02:40:59,610
more success.
So that man becomes preferable.

2910
02:40:59,940 --> 02:41:04,940
And so when you're in an open environment
like earth in 2000 and almost 15 you

2911
02:41:05,821 --> 02:41:09,240
can't do that anymore. That's stupid.
There's too much shit out there.

2912
02:41:09,390 --> 02:41:12,240
Like the amount of data is
unprocessable when it's about, oh,

2913
02:41:12,241 --> 02:41:15,270
don't eat that yellow leaf because
it gives you diarrhea. You know,

2914
02:41:15,271 --> 02:41:17,640
you eat the green leaf and
you're dead in 15 minutes.

2915
02:41:17,641 --> 02:41:19,410
Like you got to know that
stuff or are you going to,

2916
02:41:19,411 --> 02:41:22,740
you're a dumb ass out in the jungle and
you're going to die. Right, exactly.

2917
02:41:22,770 --> 02:41:25,880
But that's a finite amount of
shit. You know, there's the,

2918
02:41:25,960 --> 02:41:29,700
it's just about like what fish will kill
you if it bites your Dick, you know,

2919
02:41:29,701 --> 02:41:31,650
like this, you don't, you, you know,

2920
02:41:31,651 --> 02:41:35,220
the amount of data that
you have to process being a
human with a computer today,

2921
02:41:35,370 --> 02:41:36,330
it's unsurmountable

2922
02:41:36,410 --> 02:41:41,150
on, it really is. It really is. So there's
no shame in saying, I don't know. In fact,

2923
02:41:41,280 --> 02:41:44,210
I, I trust people more when
they say, I don't know.

2924
02:41:44,211 --> 02:41:47,420
Because the worst thing is when you
have someone in the media who has no

2925
02:41:47,421 --> 02:41:50,240
freaking idea what they're talking about
and they're just bullshitting their way

2926
02:41:50,241 --> 02:41:53,030
through an interview or bull,
you know, like, you know,

2927
02:41:53,031 --> 02:41:55,610
Sarah Pailin wasn't so good at
bullshitting her way through it.

2928
02:41:55,611 --> 02:41:57,200
But instead of saying,
I don't know,

2929
02:41:57,201 --> 02:42:00,650
her dumb ass tried to answer questions
and like the most ignorant way possible.

2930
02:42:00,920 --> 02:42:02,570
Well she got busted the the whole thing.

2931
02:42:02,571 --> 02:42:05,370
The can of worms opened up with
that Katie Kirk, that was so,

2932
02:42:05,520 --> 02:42:10,260
it turned out that she has read anything
but like so obvious. Oh you know,

2933
02:42:10,261 --> 02:42:13,160
you know as a shit.
I read newspapers,

2934
02:42:13,500 --> 02:42:16,490
I'm reading fortune cookies and stuff.
I checked a Chinaman.

2935
02:42:16,750 --> 02:42:21,750
She just decided to just go on that with
no preparation and just charm her way

2936
02:42:21,861 --> 02:42:24,860
through it. I bet you thought it
was just going to be all softballs,

2937
02:42:25,280 --> 02:42:27,600
but that's the thing a lot of,
first of all,

2938
02:42:27,601 --> 02:42:29,210
a lot of the questions were soft ball.

2939
02:42:29,360 --> 02:42:30,270
I mean how about this,

2940
02:42:30,330 --> 02:42:34,260
do you think that that same approach
would have ever been done if it was a man?

2941
02:42:34,440 --> 02:42:37,860
Do you think that a man from Alaska would
be asked what books he reads or what

2942
02:42:37,920 --> 02:42:40,800
newspapers he subscribes to?
I bet they wouldn't.

2943
02:42:40,930 --> 02:42:44,200
Well, I think that honestly
with the way the interview went,

2944
02:42:44,201 --> 02:42:48,130
it started off with respectable question,
respectful questions. It wasn't,

2945
02:42:48,131 --> 02:42:51,130
it wasn't like a gender thing at
all. Like, Oh, you're a woman,

2946
02:42:51,131 --> 02:42:52,300
so I'm going to softball you.

2947
02:42:52,690 --> 02:42:57,430
I think that Katie realize that this woman
has no idea what she's talking about.

2948
02:42:57,460 --> 02:43:02,350
And so her follow up questions were super
tame, you know, kind of like, all right,

2949
02:43:02,351 --> 02:43:04,090
we'll do you read news?
Yeah.

2950
02:43:04,091 --> 02:43:07,210
It never got really confrontational
the way maybe you would do it right?

2951
02:43:07,450 --> 02:43:12,280
I mean you would go after. Yeah, I think.
I would think so too. Um, I remember

2952
02:43:12,280 --> 02:43:15,340
one when I was at, but I think
Katie was probably setting her up.

2953
02:43:15,460 --> 02:43:18,580
She's probably had given her some
soft jabs. Yeah. Waiting to drop that.

2954
02:43:18,581 --> 02:43:20,860
What do you read bitch playing?
You know,

2955
02:43:20,861 --> 02:43:24,220
think they researched and found out that
chick doesn't read anything. I probably,

2956
02:43:24,221 --> 02:43:27,700
they probably did. I actually, I think
that Katie Couric was tactful. She,

2957
02:43:27,820 --> 02:43:31,960
she handled it. Jamie agrees. Yeah.
Sat her up big right hand. She,

2958
02:43:31,961 --> 02:43:35,350
what do you read bitch? Plam
the knees go, eyes rolled back.

2959
02:43:37,620 --> 02:43:38,453
She plus,

2960
02:43:38,530 --> 02:43:41,590
well Harold is a little bit of that
like Katie's thing and I could be the

2961
02:43:41,591 --> 02:43:45,550
fucking president too. Wow.
Think about that for a second.

2962
02:43:45,551 --> 02:43:50,230
Think about how that woman almost became
the vice president of the United States.

2963
02:43:51,160 --> 02:43:53,890
SORTA. Kinda. Yeah. It would've been fun.

2964
02:43:53,891 --> 02:43:56,140
Just like Dan Quayle who
do the same type of shit,

2965
02:43:56,141 --> 02:43:58,290
Mccain's still alive look
all these whoa through.

2966
02:43:58,540 --> 02:44:00,160
So she wouldn't really have any influence,

2967
02:44:00,161 --> 02:44:03,250
but maybe though the job might have
killed him cause we don't know what Obama

2968
02:44:03,270 --> 02:44:05,590
really would have looked like
if he never got that Gig.

2969
02:44:05,770 --> 02:44:08,390
I mean he might've all black hair right
now. Could you imagine that? Yeah.

2970
02:44:08,400 --> 02:44:11,020
He looked like pretty similar to
the way he looks six years ago.

2971
02:44:11,600 --> 02:44:15,710
I mean he aged so much in six years.
We'll do about how terrible this job.

2972
02:44:15,711 --> 02:44:17,120
I would never want to be
president of the youth.

2973
02:44:17,150 --> 02:44:19,760
I wouldn't want to be a politician,
period. It sounds like it.

2974
02:44:19,800 --> 02:44:20,700
Terrible job.

2975
02:44:20,850 --> 02:44:25,050
It almost sounds like an incredibly flawed
system that is taking part in in the

2976
02:44:25,051 --> 02:44:27,960
where it's like almost like the answer
trying to rebuild the ant colony while

2977
02:44:27,961 --> 02:44:30,930
they're carrying leaves in like, guys,
we've got to make new tunnels. Fuck off.

2978
02:44:30,931 --> 02:44:34,530
Carry this. Yeah. How are you going
to fix this gigantic ant colony?

2979
02:44:34,531 --> 02:44:37,980
You're not going to fix that.
It's a great analogy. I love that,

2980
02:44:38,070 --> 02:44:40,000
but isn't it like that kind of,
in a way it's like you,

2981
02:44:40,020 --> 02:44:41,250
even if you're the president,

2982
02:44:41,280 --> 02:44:44,280
even if you're the one person that gets
to talk to Congress and you have debate

2983
02:44:44,281 --> 02:44:47,810
and you do speeches and all this different
there, the reality is, Mike, God would,

2984
02:44:47,811 --> 02:44:52,080
a machine is behind this fucking world.
Oh my God. How many influences my God,

2985
02:44:52,081 --> 02:44:53,400
how much money,
my God,

2986
02:44:53,401 --> 02:44:58,170
how much long standing patterns of
behavior that are very difficult to change

2987
02:44:58,171 --> 02:44:59,490
like a lobbyists.

2988
02:44:59,740 --> 02:45:03,120
But if somebody tried to propose lobbyists
today in the age of the Internet,

2989
02:45:03,121 --> 02:45:06,050
if like there was no lobbyists and they
tried to come along and propose a lot of

2990
02:45:06,051 --> 02:45:10,470
people like get the fuck out,
100% what are you talking about?

2991
02:45:10,471 --> 02:45:15,030
100% if the Internet got to vote on
whether or not Congress would allow

2992
02:45:15,031 --> 02:45:18,660
corporations to donate money like
an individual, they would go,

2993
02:45:18,661 --> 02:45:23,370
are you fucking crazy? Why
would we do that? Why would
we do that? Why would it be?

2994
02:45:23,371 --> 02:45:27,720
What's the benefit? Dirtier rivers like
what? What's the benefit there? What's,

2995
02:45:27,721 --> 02:45:29,250
what's, what's going to come
out of that. That's good.

2996
02:45:29,550 --> 02:45:30,920
I know. It's crazy. Yeah.

2997
02:45:30,930 --> 02:45:34,980
The system is definitely set up against
us and the entire notion of a democratic

2998
02:45:34,981 --> 02:45:35,431
process.

2999
02:45:35,431 --> 02:45:39,570
You can't have a democratic process when
you have corporations giving unlimited

3000
02:45:39,571 --> 02:45:42,000
amounts of money to politicians.
It's just not going to happen.

3001
02:45:42,210 --> 02:45:46,650
There's no competition. You
know, this is, this blew my mind,

3002
02:45:46,651 --> 02:45:49,980
although I've done this type of reporting
for so long, it shouldn't surprise me.

3003
02:45:50,220 --> 02:45:51,780
During the midterm elections,

3004
02:45:52,050 --> 02:45:56,220
the Koch Brothers spent between 275 no,

3005
02:45:56,280 --> 02:46:00,930
225 and $300 million.
I mean,

3006
02:46:00,931 --> 02:46:05,931
let's just go to the lower end of that
$225 million to influence the midterm

3007
02:46:06,841 --> 02:46:10,010
elections. So crazy. It's, it's so much

3008
02:46:10,010 --> 02:46:11,200
money.
It's so much money.

3009
02:46:11,310 --> 02:46:14,820
I love that they're called the Koch
brothers too. I hope they do a lot of it.

3010
02:46:15,090 --> 02:46:18,460
I hope they do it in their underwear
while they're getting their toes. Dot.

3011
02:46:18,880 --> 02:46:23,430
You know, they just are just constantly
getting massaged and eaten grapes.

3012
02:46:23,431 --> 02:46:24,560
People dangled grapes over there.

3013
02:46:24,640 --> 02:46:28,710
Very sure they, I mean, I always wonder
brothers I live in like gangsters.

3014
02:46:29,100 --> 02:46:32,010
How much money do you need?
How much freaking money do you know?

3015
02:46:32,210 --> 02:46:35,180
Well obviously you don't need that
225 million just gives those stupid

3016
02:46:35,181 --> 02:46:37,970
politicians and the politicians eat it up.

3017
02:46:38,360 --> 02:46:41,750
They have to do is well yeah
how much money do you need?

3018
02:46:41,751 --> 02:46:46,070
And but I think it's also
their professional players
of the game that has made

3019
02:46:46,071 --> 02:46:47,420
them incredibly successful.
Yup.

3020
02:46:47,470 --> 02:46:50,600
They're the baddest motherfucking
monopoly players on earth. You know,

3021
02:46:50,610 --> 02:46:52,610
they figured out a way to
do it at a very high stakes.

3022
02:46:52,620 --> 02:46:53,810
I'm sure it's insanely addictive.

3023
02:46:54,120 --> 02:46:58,410
They don't want to let it go. No, I'm sure
it is addictive as well. And you know,

3024
02:46:58,800 --> 02:47:02,270
first of all they're terrible people so
don't think that I'm excusing them but

3025
02:47:02,340 --> 02:47:04,380
dare you.
But I will also say,

3026
02:47:04,830 --> 02:47:07,680
I will also say that if the
system is set up as such,

3027
02:47:07,740 --> 02:47:09,510
why wouldn't you take advantage of it?

3028
02:47:11,220 --> 02:47:14,820
Because you're nice cause your ethical
cause you realize you're a temporary life

3029
02:47:14,821 --> 02:47:18,300
forms sharing time with these other people
and she'd tried to make the world the

3030
02:47:18,301 --> 02:47:22,890
best possible. You have the best possible
influence on it that you can. Yeah.

3031
02:47:23,100 --> 02:47:27,060
That's not the best possible influence
on it and it's not the best beneficial if

3032
02:47:27,061 --> 02:47:27,661
fill it for you.

3033
02:47:27,661 --> 02:47:30,480
It's not that beneficial because
you've already reached this point of

3034
02:47:30,481 --> 02:47:34,680
diminishing returns where you got
enough money to donate $225 million.

3035
02:47:35,100 --> 02:47:38,670
Whoa.
Do you like fly fishing?

3036
02:47:38,790 --> 02:47:42,600
Because you should do that with
your day. If you could. You imagine,

3037
02:47:42,720 --> 02:47:47,130
I would never even think about
working in a bank if I had,

3038
02:47:47,160 --> 02:47:51,870
if I had enough money where I could
give someone $225 million to, you know,

3039
02:47:51,871 --> 02:47:56,040
fix whatever fucking laws or make it
so yeah. You know, whatever the fuck.

3040
02:47:56,750 --> 02:48:00,400
Damn again, still sit in my favor.
My God. I would be, I would,

3041
02:48:00,430 --> 02:48:03,280
I would be like tuna fishing.

3042
02:48:03,490 --> 02:48:06,910
I would get a jet ski that goes a hundred
miles an hour. It'd be having fun.

3043
02:48:07,420 --> 02:48:09,510
Why would you,
why would you want to be involved?

3044
02:48:09,550 --> 02:48:14,350
You're like 80 what are you doing?
How much more money can you like enjoy?

3045
02:48:14,530 --> 02:48:16,330
I don't understand it at all.
I mean,

3046
02:48:16,331 --> 02:48:20,240
what's the point of building this kind
of wealth if you don't actually use it?

3047
02:48:20,241 --> 02:48:22,030
And I'm sure they enjoy it in some ways,

3048
02:48:22,031 --> 02:48:26,050
but they also spend a sizable chunk
of their lives destroying the country.

3049
02:48:26,370 --> 02:48:27,900
I think there's also a momentum behind it,

3050
02:48:27,901 --> 02:48:31,650
like a successful mantram almost
akin to what you were describing.

3051
02:48:31,651 --> 02:48:34,560
When you see other people that are
more successful and even though you get

3052
02:48:34,561 --> 02:48:35,281
inspired by it,

3053
02:48:35,281 --> 02:48:40,281
some people may not like that thing that
drives you to worry about your success

3054
02:48:40,860 --> 02:48:44,130
level, which is very high for,
would you say you're 28 yeah,

3055
02:48:44,280 --> 02:48:46,080
very high for 28 year old woman.

3056
02:48:46,081 --> 02:48:50,130
You've been on a very successful
new show for many years now.

3057
02:48:50,131 --> 02:48:53,700
You're very respected. You do these
conversations with people online.

3058
02:48:53,760 --> 02:48:55,530
They're very well received,

3059
02:48:55,740 --> 02:48:59,580
but yet you still will trip about like
what you've done and what you haven't

3060
02:48:59,581 --> 02:49:02,550
done well. I guess when you're like
a super fucking crazy billionaire,

3061
02:49:02,760 --> 02:49:05,420
maybe you want to be like Dracula
or some of them, you know?

3062
02:49:05,530 --> 02:49:10,400
Maybe you want to have a hoard of slaves
that bow before you and you're just

3063
02:49:10,410 --> 02:49:15,410
waiting for you to have enough money to
buy some technology that turns the world

3064
02:49:15,871 --> 02:49:18,210
and the fucking goblins that are
at your command or something.

3065
02:49:18,330 --> 02:49:22,800
I don't fucking know. I'm not exactly
sure if I get that kind of motivation.

3066
02:49:23,370 --> 02:49:27,090
You know, like $100 billion
motivation or toward 10 billion.

3067
02:49:27,091 --> 02:49:28,530
All your woe to doing.

3068
02:49:28,630 --> 02:49:32,770
What'd you doing? I don't know. I don't
understand it either. And you know,

3069
02:49:33,040 --> 02:49:36,310
like earlier in the show I talked about
how I questioned whether or not people

3070
02:49:36,311 --> 02:49:37,600
are inherently good.
And you know what?

3071
02:49:37,660 --> 02:49:41,470
I think a lot of people are inherently
good and we've turned you around. You,

3072
02:49:41,471 --> 02:49:44,770
you have this was,
this has been a very productive podcast.

3073
02:49:45,070 --> 02:49:49,960
The one thing that I will say is I get
a lot of pleasure out of giving back to

3074
02:49:49,961 --> 02:49:52,870
my community because
growing up here in la,

3075
02:49:53,170 --> 02:49:58,170
there were so many things that were
provided to me as someone who was kind of

3076
02:49:58,241 --> 02:50:01,180
disadvantaged because like growing up,
my parents weren't wealthy. You know,

3077
02:50:01,181 --> 02:50:04,360
my parents were struggling,
they were working class.

3078
02:50:04,361 --> 02:50:08,330
And I had a great public
education. I had, you know,

3079
02:50:08,480 --> 02:50:10,930
access to something
called healthy families,

3080
02:50:10,931 --> 02:50:13,510
which was like an affordable form
of health insurance for kids.

3081
02:50:13,511 --> 02:50:17,020
Like all of these things were
paid for by tax payers. Right.

3082
02:50:17,290 --> 02:50:20,650
And these are the things that helped me
build a life for myself and helped me

3083
02:50:20,651 --> 02:50:21,700
become successful.

3084
02:50:22,000 --> 02:50:27,000
And I feel like it's my obligation to
give back to the community and help in any

3085
02:50:27,431 --> 02:50:28,241
way that I can.

3086
02:50:28,241 --> 02:50:33,070
Cause I want to see people who are maybe
from a poor neighborhood grow up and be

3087
02:50:33,071 --> 02:50:35,500
able to do what they really want
to do with their lives. You know,

3088
02:50:35,501 --> 02:50:36,640
I'm living my dream right now.

3089
02:50:36,641 --> 02:50:38,950
I want to make sure other
people have that same ability.

3090
02:50:39,000 --> 02:50:39,691
That's beautiful.

3091
02:50:39,691 --> 02:50:41,720
I think it's really cool that you do that
and I think it's really cool that you

3092
02:50:41,721 --> 02:50:44,070
teach that in journalism course
too, because I love it. Yeah,

3093
02:50:44,100 --> 02:50:47,070
it's cool that you're doing it and you're
like someone who's actually out there

3094
02:50:47,280 --> 02:50:49,050
doing it as a Gig,
you know?

3095
02:50:49,051 --> 02:50:51,240
And then you're teaching people
how to do it and do it correctly.

3096
02:50:51,300 --> 02:50:54,390
That's about it. Yeah, it's great.
That cast Berrien, we're at a time,

3097
02:50:54,391 --> 02:50:58,240
we just sit three hours
sane so fast by five by,

3098
02:50:58,490 --> 02:51:02,130
if I didn't have to pee so hard it would
have been like the last 10 minutes I'm

3099
02:51:02,131 --> 02:51:06,010
hanging in there, but uh, okay.
Uh, Twitter and a CAS baron.

3100
02:51:06,011 --> 02:51:08,460
Is there anything you would like to
promote or tell me what you got coming up?

3101
02:51:08,620 --> 02:51:11,920
So I have a personal youtube channel.
I post a lot of stuff on there.

3102
02:51:12,150 --> 02:51:16,930
It's youtube.com/ana a Berrien. So check
me out there. And Instagram and a cast.

3103
02:51:16,931 --> 02:51:17,890
Barry and TYT.

3104
02:51:18,140 --> 02:51:21,650
Beautiful. Thank you. It was
always fine. I had a great time.

3105
02:51:21,740 --> 02:51:25,220
I had a great time doing your show too. It
was really fun. Oh, oh. All right folks.

3106
02:51:25,221 --> 02:51:29,390
That's it for now. Uh, we will be back
next week. A lot of fun guests are,

3107
02:51:29,391 --> 02:51:33,080
can't tell you who it's some secret shit,
but, uh, we got some good ones. All right.

3108
02:51:33,081 --> 02:51:36,920
So enjoy your weekend or whenever
the fuck you're listening to this.

3109
02:51:36,921 --> 02:51:38,930
And much love. Big Kiss
Mom, mom, mom, my mom.

3110
02:51:39,110 --> 02:51:39,943
Bye.

3111
02:51:49,030 --> 02:51:49,863
Hmm.

3112
02:51:53,110 --> 02:51:53,160
Okay.
