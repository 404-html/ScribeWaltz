1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:00,843
Ready,

2
00:00:05,670 --> 00:00:06,810
boom,
and we're live.

3
00:00:07,020 --> 00:00:08,280
What's up man?
How's it going?

4
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:09,570
Pleasure to meet you.
Finally.

5
00:00:09,571 --> 00:00:09,991
Get you.
Yeah,

6
00:00:09,991 --> 00:00:11,700
man.
I'm a fucking huge fan of yours.

7
00:00:11,750 --> 00:00:12,000
Oh,
well,

8
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,820
thank you very much.
I listened to your,

9
00:00:13,860 --> 00:00:16,170
the last album.
I've listened to that fucking thing

10
00:00:16,171 --> 00:00:18,360
hundreds of times.
I'll listen to it all the time when I'm

11
00:00:18,361 --> 00:00:20,640
headed to the comedy store,
puts me in a good mood.

12
00:00:20,700 --> 00:00:23,010
Less good.
That's what music is supposed to do.

13
00:00:23,370 --> 00:00:28,370
I just stunned by the fact that for the
longest time you were basically doing

14
00:00:29,040 --> 00:00:31,890
the songwriting thing.
You were doing a lot of that.

15
00:00:31,891 --> 00:00:34,980
You were making your own music,
but you were known more as a songwriter.

16
00:00:35,370 --> 00:00:35,881
Yeah.
He will,

17
00:00:35,881 --> 00:00:37,320
you know,
you walked through the doors that are

18
00:00:37,321 --> 00:00:40,490
open,
so you do the things that come up and,

19
00:00:40,491 --> 00:00:41,650
and uh,
you know,

20
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:44,040
somewhere in the middle of that you find
out what your thing is.

21
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:46,980
You know,
God damn your voice is so good,

22
00:00:46,981 --> 00:00:48,200
man.
I mean,

23
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:53,500
I don't want a fan boy out on you,
but it's just such a classic like male

24
00:00:54,631 --> 00:00:58,470
voice singing those kinds of songs.
It's like,

25
00:00:58,830 --> 00:01:01,080
I'm glad someone's still doing it.
Right.

26
00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:02,130
Oh,
well I don't.

27
00:01:02,131 --> 00:01:03,010
I don't know,
you know.

28
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:05,010
Thank you.
I'll also say thank you.

29
00:01:05,011 --> 00:01:07,290
I don't want to say I'm doing it right
and somebody else is doing it wrong.

30
00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:09,310
Well for me,
I'm doing what I do.

31
00:01:09,590 --> 00:01:11,160
You Bill what you do?
I like,

32
00:01:11,420 --> 00:01:13,200
so I'm,
I'm just happy that someone out there

33
00:01:13,201 --> 00:01:14,370
doing what you're doing.
Thank you.

34
00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:16,080
And uh,
what,

35
00:01:16,090 --> 00:01:17,340
what,
what is going on with you right now?

36
00:01:17,341 --> 00:01:18,630
You've got a new album's about to come
out.

37
00:01:18,710 --> 00:01:23,650
Got a new album that's a,
came out December first and yeah,

38
00:01:23,660 --> 00:01:27,110
we're proud of it and hope people like
it because it on itunes and all that

39
00:01:27,140 --> 00:01:27,973
jazz.
Yeah.

40
00:01:28,130 --> 00:01:31,310
You can get it at where that music is
available as far as I know that that's

41
00:01:31,311 --> 00:01:31,920
what they tell me.

42
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:34,620
So how does the doors opened up for you
now?

43
00:01:34,621 --> 00:01:36,980
Is Everything feel like,
yeah,

44
00:01:36,990 --> 00:01:38,030
we're sitting here talking to them.

45
00:01:40,170 --> 00:01:41,003
No.
Yeah,

46
00:01:41,030 --> 00:01:45,150
I mean beyond good.
Good would be the understatement of the

47
00:01:45,151 --> 00:01:46,240
century for,
for,

48
00:01:46,270 --> 00:01:50,790
you know,
just so many things that sound like fake

49
00:01:51,540 --> 00:01:53,420
fake life.
Yeah.

50
00:01:53,510 --> 00:01:54,960
You know,
things that happen in phone calls,

51
00:01:54,961 --> 00:01:57,660
you get people you meet,
people you to talk to and like what?

52
00:01:59,380 --> 00:02:00,420
Shoot man,
just any of it.

53
00:02:00,421 --> 00:02:00,930
Just,
you know,

54
00:02:00,930 --> 00:02:04,350
getting to go play.
This past year we played three shows

55
00:02:04,351 --> 00:02:05,400
with Tom Petty and the heartbreakers

56
00:02:05,670 --> 00:02:08,020
Oh man.
You know,

57
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:10,650
that must have been amazing.
It was amazing.

58
00:02:10,651 --> 00:02:13,680
We played Wrigley field with Tom Petty
and the heartbreakers Holy Shit.

59
00:02:17,050 --> 00:02:19,080
It was just that,
I don't know,

60
00:02:19,081 --> 00:02:20,640
it was a bunch,
but it,

61
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:26,100
it felt just as cool as it sounds like
it should man.

62
00:02:26,101 --> 00:02:28,980
Wrigley field with Tom Petty and the
heartbreakers.

63
00:02:28,981 --> 00:02:31,800
It doesn't get any cooler than that.
Not to me.

64
00:02:31,801 --> 00:02:32,880
It doesn't,
you know,

65
00:02:33,110 --> 00:02:35,220
but maybe there's,
maybe there's something else.

66
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:39,660
So how long has success been happening?
Like two years now.

67
00:02:40,310 --> 00:02:41,980
Um,
to,

68
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:44,010
to,
to the degree that it's happening right

69
00:02:44,011 --> 00:02:44,844
now,
you know,

70
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:48,540
probably since 2015.
A couple of couple of years of good,

71
00:02:48,541 --> 00:02:50,970
strong.
We're going on three of,

72
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:51,980
you know,
doing,

73
00:02:51,990 --> 00:02:56,100
playing shows it to more people than we
knew ever came to la show.

74
00:02:56,130 --> 00:02:59,470
So yeah,
it's been a know,

75
00:02:59,530 --> 00:03:02,760
a strange life altering thing when you
hear it.

76
00:03:02,761 --> 00:03:05,260
Ladies and Gentlemen,
please welcome Chris Stapleton and

77
00:03:06,910 --> 00:03:08,560
what is that like?
Freak you out?

78
00:03:08,740 --> 00:03:09,820
What?
We don't usually do them money,

79
00:03:09,821 --> 00:03:12,040
announcements like that.
We just kind of walk out there and play.

80
00:03:12,070 --> 00:03:13,240
That's the move.
Yeah,

81
00:03:13,241 --> 00:03:15,130
we don't,
we don't hype him up.

82
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:18,850
You have to too much.
We just kind of walk out there and fire

83
00:03:18,851 --> 00:03:20,830
up a.
That might be the way to do it.

84
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:21,850
Well,
I mean it's.

85
00:03:21,850 --> 00:03:25,060
Everybody has their own thing,
but I don't have like a hype guy doing

86
00:03:25,061 --> 00:03:26,290
that.
You need like the kiss God.

87
00:03:26,300 --> 00:03:29,860
God that's bad in the world.
I remember that when I was a kid.

88
00:03:29,861 --> 00:03:33,280
I go and see kiss live a bunch of times.
You get so fucking pumped up at the

89
00:03:33,281 --> 00:03:36,490
beginning because they would go through
the hottest band in the world.

90
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:39,580
I've never seen Kish live,
but Jane Simmons did show up to a show

91
00:03:39,581 --> 00:03:44,581
of ours wants weirdest thing ever.
He said we were in New York somewhere

92
00:03:45,370 --> 00:03:47,980
and he just happened to be in town.
He played the night before wherever we

93
00:03:47,981 --> 00:03:52,150
were playing and he showed up and just
to say hi and here's Gene Simmons on the

94
00:03:52,151 --> 00:03:54,910
side of the state before we go play our
Gig and I'm just like,

95
00:03:56,060 --> 00:03:57,250
you know,
really?

96
00:03:57,251 --> 00:04:00,190
Yeah.
It's one of those,

97
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:02,230
one of those models were talking about.
You asked about people.

98
00:04:02,290 --> 00:04:03,340
That was one of them.
It's just like,

99
00:04:03,610 --> 00:04:04,121
hi.
Hi.

100
00:04:04,121 --> 00:04:08,380
Gene Simmons.
Gene Simmons came to see me one time a

101
00:04:08,380 --> 00:04:10,150
few years back at New Year's Eve at the
Improv,

102
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:11,800
him and his family to see me.

103
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:14,680
New Year's Eve.
I was fucking legitimately nervous the

104
00:04:14,681 --> 00:04:15,750
whole time.
You're looking at Jane [inaudible]

105
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:16,593
going,
yeah,

106
00:04:16,660 --> 00:04:17,650
we're not looking at him,
you know,

107
00:04:17,710 --> 00:04:18,670
one way or the other.
You know,

108
00:04:18,730 --> 00:04:20,500
it was so odd.
It was like,

109
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:22,900
you know who I am?
Fuck,

110
00:04:22,901 --> 00:04:26,200
is that possible?
It's strange stuff,

111
00:04:26,201 --> 00:04:27,320
man.
So this phrase,

112
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:30,340
but I love talking to people that are
like a year,

113
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:33,610
two years into the situation you're in
right now where he just kind of getting

114
00:04:33,611 --> 00:04:37,450
settled into it where it still seems
like fantasy land.

115
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:41,530
I'm not sure that it would ever not seem
like fantasy land because I spent enough

116
00:04:41,530 --> 00:04:45,910
years not in fantasy land to realize
that it's in fantasy land.

117
00:04:45,911 --> 00:04:49,690
You could be,
you could be like 71 day on cocaine,

118
00:04:49,691 --> 00:04:52,670
15 ex wives,
just gotta hope not.

119
00:04:54,670 --> 00:04:58,900
That sounds horrible,
but it seems like it happens to a lot of

120
00:04:58,901 --> 00:04:59,670
folks.
Right?

121
00:04:59,670 --> 00:05:00,550
Well maybe.

122
00:05:01,370 --> 00:05:03,340
I hope not me.
Yeah,

123
00:05:03,341 --> 00:05:04,174
I hope not.
Youtube.

124
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:06,880
I mean you seem like you could avoid.
It seems like a horrid,

125
00:05:06,970 --> 00:05:08,320
horrid existence.
Well,

126
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:12,820
there's a balancing act I think with any
great musician or any great artist

127
00:05:12,821 --> 00:05:16,780
really is like doing the art and then
now you're,

128
00:05:16,810 --> 00:05:19,230
you're in the Olympics.
Like you're in this,

129
00:05:19,231 --> 00:05:22,990
this weird thing where you know you're
gonna win grammys and you're going to

130
00:05:22,991 --> 00:05:26,680
have platinum albums if they still have
those anymore and you're going to be on

131
00:05:26,681 --> 00:05:28,810
these talk shows and people are gonna
read it.

132
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:30,970
It's a different animal now.
Well,

133
00:05:31,020 --> 00:05:32,450
yeah.
I mean yes and no.

134
00:05:32,710 --> 00:05:33,750
For me,
I mean I,

135
00:05:33,751 --> 00:05:34,660
I,
I still,

136
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:39,040
whatever we have is because we
concentrate on the music and when music

137
00:05:39,041 --> 00:05:42,520
lead and so try to do anything other
than that,

138
00:05:42,580 --> 00:05:44,800
you know,
I'll have fun with some of the stuff,

139
00:05:44,830 --> 00:05:46,540
you know,
go get somebody wants me to do a bit on

140
00:05:46,541 --> 00:05:47,800
the show or something,
I'm fine with that,

141
00:05:47,801 --> 00:05:48,634
that's cool.

142
00:05:48,700 --> 00:05:50,860
But it's still all just comes from
music,

143
00:05:50,861 --> 00:05:52,060
you know,
and it's all,

144
00:05:52,810 --> 00:05:56,230
the focus is always going to be the
music and anything other than that,

145
00:05:56,420 --> 00:06:00,290
you know,
there was never in my mind and he

146
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:03,550
focused on trying to stay famous.
Does that makes sense?

147
00:06:03,930 --> 00:06:05,350
And I knew you were going to think like
that.

148
00:06:05,380 --> 00:06:06,460
Yeah,
I'm very happy.

149
00:06:06,461 --> 00:06:07,294
Sad.
No,

150
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:10,300
I didn't.
I don't make music for that reason.

151
00:06:10,350 --> 00:06:13,820
And in order to win awards or anything
like that,

152
00:06:13,821 --> 00:06:16,420
um,
I make it because I like it and hope

153
00:06:16,421 --> 00:06:17,680
that it's good.
Well,

154
00:06:17,681 --> 00:06:21,060
I think it was very clear in your music
itself that does what you're dealing

155
00:06:21,100 --> 00:06:23,950
very clear.
It's very clear that that's pure,

156
00:06:24,010 --> 00:06:27,580
that it's just this is what you do and
you're concentrating on that.

157
00:06:27,770 --> 00:06:30,040
It's not,
there's nothing disingenuous about it.

158
00:06:30,041 --> 00:06:32,400
There's nothing pumped up.
Fake or.

159
00:06:32,700 --> 00:06:33,120
Well,
yeah,

160
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:33,850
yeah,
I hope not,

161
00:06:33,850 --> 00:06:35,200
you know,
I know,

162
00:06:35,201 --> 00:06:35,470
right.

163
00:06:35,470 --> 00:06:36,303
That's the.
Yeah.

164
00:06:36,340 --> 00:06:38,770
But I mean it's gotta be a weird world.
I mean,

165
00:06:38,771 --> 00:06:41,920
the world of the music business is very,
very strange world.

166
00:06:41,921 --> 00:06:44,480
I've talked to a lot of musicians and
you know,

167
00:06:44,910 --> 00:06:47,650
navigating the world of commerce and
music and

168
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:50,361
there again,
I,

169
00:06:50,361 --> 00:06:51,290
you know,
I always,

170
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:56,120
if you just simplify it down to let the
music lead and let that kind of be

171
00:06:56,121 --> 00:07:01,121
always the focus for me that makes it
real easy to not make what decisions you

172
00:07:03,171 --> 00:07:06,080
would regret or,
or feel like weren't you.

173
00:07:06,590 --> 00:07:09,560
So as long as that's the focus,
that's okay.

174
00:07:09,561 --> 00:07:11,680
You know,
all that other stuff just kind of

175
00:07:11,750 --> 00:07:12,760
becomes,
you know,

176
00:07:13,970 --> 00:07:18,560
external noise that will all,
it doesn't matter,

177
00:07:18,561 --> 00:07:20,570
you know,
it's not a,

178
00:07:20,571 --> 00:07:23,120
it's not a,
it's not a hard thing to navigate in

179
00:07:23,121 --> 00:07:25,950
that realm to me,
to you,

180
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:26,873
to me.
No,

181
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:29,430
but you must see it being a difficult
thing for some folks.

182
00:07:29,470 --> 00:07:30,303
You now,
right?

183
00:07:31,260 --> 00:07:32,740
Uh,
sometimes you know,

184
00:07:32,770 --> 00:07:34,270
some people,
but some people,

185
00:07:35,030 --> 00:07:36,750
um,
you know,

186
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:40,820
care very much about
him.

187
00:07:40,980 --> 00:07:45,300
This is the first,
you're the first person to ever get me

188
00:07:45,301 --> 00:07:47,460
in dangerous waters.
Like I'm talking about people.

189
00:07:47,850 --> 00:07:52,410
We don't have to name names,
I don't want to sound judgemental.

190
00:07:52,510 --> 00:07:56,190
And what I'm saying,
my wife calls this pulling back the

191
00:07:56,191 --> 00:07:57,510
curtain too much.
She's like,

192
00:07:57,530 --> 00:08:00,210
don't pull back that curtain too much,
but you know,

193
00:08:00,211 --> 00:08:01,960
if you want to pull it back,
I know that you,

194
00:08:01,961 --> 00:08:03,270
like,
you're the guy that likes to pull back

195
00:08:03,271 --> 00:08:05,400
the curtain.
I think it's good to look back there

196
00:08:05,410 --> 00:08:06,630
sometimes.
Fuck,

197
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:07,680
the monsters are up to.

198
00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:12,420
Well yeah,
I mean I think,

199
00:08:12,510 --> 00:08:14,030
I think uh,
if you,

200
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:16,680
if you roll up into the music business
or you know,

201
00:08:16,681 --> 00:08:20,580
this is my experience,
if you roll up into one to make records

202
00:08:20,581 --> 00:08:22,770
and wanting to be in the music business
and wanting to make a living,

203
00:08:22,771 --> 00:08:24,480
playing music,
uh,

204
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:28,440
having absolutely no opinion of what you
want to do or who you are,

205
00:08:28,441 --> 00:08:31,620
how you do it,
and you want everybody else to tell you

206
00:08:31,621 --> 00:08:33,720
how to do it and what to do.
And when and where,

207
00:08:33,721 --> 00:08:35,670
and why,
then yeah,

208
00:08:35,671 --> 00:08:39,780
it can be a confusing thing because
there will be a lot of external opinions

209
00:08:39,810 --> 00:08:43,260
that aren't yours,
that will create someone that is not

210
00:08:43,261 --> 00:08:45,420
you,
that you will have to play for the rest

211
00:08:45,421 --> 00:08:48,690
of your life.
So it was that.

212
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:51,990
So,
uh,

213
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:54,000
you know,
but as long as you're doing things that,

214
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:56,930
that are you and do come,
you know,

215
00:08:57,780 --> 00:09:02,670
from you and from who you are and what
you'd like to do that that's never wrong

216
00:09:02,671 --> 00:09:03,180
decision.

217
00:09:03,180 --> 00:09:08,180
And sometimes that doesn't add up to
most times it doesn't add up to some

218
00:09:08,491 --> 00:09:09,900
kind of commercial success.
But,

219
00:09:10,250 --> 00:09:13,320
uh,
you know,

220
00:09:13,321 --> 00:09:18,321
at least you can look at yourself in the
mirror on it and not hate whatever it is

221
00:09:18,561 --> 00:09:20,290
you have to go out and play.
Right.

222
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:23,120
Let's see.
So it can become my artistic equivalent

223
00:09:23,121 --> 00:09:26,570
of like a soulless corporate job where
you just kind of get sucked into

224
00:09:26,571 --> 00:09:28,370
something.
You want to be doing it for a living.

225
00:09:28,580 --> 00:09:31,100
Maybe it makes you money,
but you never really get to be yourself

226
00:09:31,101 --> 00:09:34,490
because you're sort of programmed into
this thing that they've sort of

227
00:09:34,491 --> 00:09:36,470
manufactured.
Yes.

228
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:37,240
Yeah.
Well,

229
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:41,400
a or an or you ignore it.
Some other passion or talent that you

230
00:09:41,401 --> 00:09:45,960
have
under the guise of it seeming risky or

231
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:49,560
irresponsible and try to do,
go do this thing that seems like in your

232
00:09:49,561 --> 00:09:51,060
mind is the normal thing to do.

233
00:09:51,140 --> 00:09:54,860
Like when Garth Brooks put on that wig
and pretended to be that other dude,

234
00:09:55,430 --> 00:09:59,480
remember that part?
I remember that thing to remember.

235
00:09:59,770 --> 00:10:02,720
The love that I love when someone goes
like,

236
00:10:02,890 --> 00:10:05,120
Whoa,
way off the reservation.

237
00:10:05,670 --> 00:10:08,570
Well,
I think the story was that,

238
00:10:08,571 --> 00:10:11,390
and I don't know if this is true or not,
that there was supposed to be like a

239
00:10:11,391 --> 00:10:12,590
movie.
Yeah,

240
00:10:12,591 --> 00:10:15,140
they did a documentary.
They did a behind the music.

241
00:10:15,410 --> 00:10:17,650
Is that about this fake guy?
But I think.

242
00:10:17,780 --> 00:10:20,870
I think the idea was that we're supposed
to be a movie here it is.

243
00:10:21,590 --> 00:10:24,170
And then.
And then like this was supposed to be

244
00:10:24,171 --> 00:10:28,460
like the soundtrack,
but I think the mistake if there was a

245
00:10:28,461 --> 00:10:30,530
mistake,
and I'm not going to try to discuss

246
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:33,980
research and career in the realm of
making mistakes,

247
00:10:34,550 --> 00:10:36,920
well you know,
who am I to judge anybody?

248
00:10:37,950 --> 00:10:40,880
Typically somebody who is as successful
as he is,

249
00:10:40,910 --> 00:10:41,930
but I'd love.

250
00:10:41,930 --> 00:10:45,260
I got friends in low places.
I love a lot of garth's music.

251
00:10:45,261 --> 00:10:49,040
I'm not a garth brooks hater.
I think that was a colossal fuck up.

252
00:10:49,041 --> 00:10:51,860
That I think is hilarious and if God's
was here,

253
00:10:51,861 --> 00:10:54,950
I'd pull that up and I would tell him I
loved him and I would say,

254
00:10:54,951 --> 00:10:57,320
come on dude.
What the fuck were you smoking back

255
00:10:57,321 --> 00:10:58,790
then?
Like who talked you into this?

256
00:10:59,090 --> 00:11:00,110
You know,
I will say,

257
00:11:00,111 --> 00:11:05,111
I think at the time that he did that,
he had to be into what in the world else

258
00:11:05,991 --> 00:11:07,850
can I do?
The only way I can become more

259
00:11:07,851 --> 00:11:12,170
successful is if I become someone else
and make them successful.

260
00:11:12,530 --> 00:11:17,530
He was so successful and still is in
that space that he can't be any bigger

261
00:11:17,601 --> 00:11:20,630
than he is like Stephen King when he
used to write as Richard Bachman.

262
00:11:20,690 --> 00:11:22,070
Do you remember that?
No,

263
00:11:22,071 --> 00:11:22,600
I don't.

264
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:23,550
I'm not aware of this.
Yeah.

265
00:11:23,570 --> 00:11:27,650
He wrote a bunch of books under a
pseudonym because he was so gigantic

266
00:11:27,651 --> 00:11:31,790
that he decided to write some books
under a different name so that people

267
00:11:31,791 --> 00:11:35,330
would sort of appreciate the work for
what it was instead of as a Stephen King

268
00:11:35,331 --> 00:11:35,901
book,
I think.

269
00:11:35,901 --> 00:11:37,820
Or just maybe even as an exercise.
Right.

270
00:11:37,821 --> 00:11:39,360
Well,
I think very much that's what it is.

271
00:11:40,580 --> 00:11:41,810
I would look at it very much the same
way.

272
00:11:41,811 --> 00:11:44,700
Of course it's kind of hard when it's
your face up there to put a mask on.

273
00:11:45,380 --> 00:11:48,440
Something should have got like Rick
Baker to do them up with a fake nose,

274
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:50,900
you know,
completely.

275
00:11:51,020 --> 00:11:52,520
You know?
Yeah.

276
00:11:52,521 --> 00:11:57,521
Well make like an ugly weathered look in
Saddle Warren Dude,

277
00:11:57,760 --> 00:12:00,700
put a seal wig on and go.
Yeah.

278
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:04,240
But it was a.
They had a behind the music story on his

279
00:12:04,241 --> 00:12:08,230
life store and the drugs and all the
problems and the moodiness and you know,

280
00:12:08,470 --> 00:12:12,280
but the music was always there and it's
a hilarious behind the,

281
00:12:12,550 --> 00:12:13,390
behind the music.

282
00:12:13,390 --> 00:12:15,970
You could watch it on youtube.
I highly recommend it.

283
00:12:16,330 --> 00:12:18,220
Okay,
well I will watch it on Youtube.

284
00:12:18,390 --> 00:12:22,720
I haven't seen that particular thing,
but he's pulled himself out of that.

285
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:26,620
He had a giant long hiatus and here's an
interesting thing about garth brooks.

286
00:12:26,621 --> 00:12:29,350
He can't get his shit on itunes.
Oh No.

287
00:12:29,351 --> 00:12:32,410
You have to get it on whatever his CD or
whatever.

288
00:12:32,490 --> 00:12:35,830
Then there's also his personality.
He had something called ghost tunes for

289
00:12:35,831 --> 00:12:36,461
a minute,
I think.

290
00:12:36,461 --> 00:12:40,420
Was that the name of it?
It was like his own curated streaming

291
00:12:40,421 --> 00:12:43,750
service where you stream only garth
brooks tunes or something like that.

292
00:12:43,751 --> 00:12:46,540
I don't know.
I remember something about that.

293
00:12:46,710 --> 00:12:48,850
Well,
I think his idea is that he wants his

294
00:12:48,851 --> 00:12:51,250
albums played from there to as ghost
tunes.

295
00:12:52,030 --> 00:12:55,720
He wants his albums played from the
first song to the last.

296
00:12:55,750 --> 00:12:58,270
He doesn't want like little bits and
chunks.

297
00:12:58,270 --> 00:13:00,430
He doesn't want to sell his songs
individually.

298
00:13:00,460 --> 00:13:02,740
This is what I believe I've read that he
liked.

299
00:13:02,770 --> 00:13:06,430
He thinks of his albums as one
continuous work and while I,

300
00:13:06,450 --> 00:13:09,370
you know,
I as much as anybody can understand that

301
00:13:09,371 --> 00:13:13,540
and want very much people to listen to
things as bodies work,

302
00:13:13,990 --> 00:13:16,710
but in the world we're living in,
you know,

303
00:13:16,750 --> 00:13:19,840
sometimes you gotta let people skip over
a song here,

304
00:13:20,710 --> 00:13:22,390
let people do whatever they want with
me.

305
00:13:22,391 --> 00:13:25,980
You did.
I don't want control people's right

306
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,550
thing.
Yeah.

307
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:30,310
And sometimes it's just a song that gets
them.

308
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:32,950
And that song,
if you sell that song individually,

309
00:13:32,951 --> 00:13:35,170
that'll get them and then maybe they'll
check.

310
00:13:35,171 --> 00:13:37,300
All right,
well listen to this 100 times.

311
00:13:37,330 --> 00:13:39,010
What else Chris got to say?
Yeah,

312
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:40,353
maybe.
I don't know.

313
00:13:41,140 --> 00:13:45,490
So how did you get a quote unquote
discovered as a singer?

314
00:13:45,510 --> 00:13:47,250
Did you,
you started off as a songwriter,

315
00:13:47,260 --> 00:13:48,400
but you were always singing.

316
00:13:48,670 --> 00:13:51,010
I was singing,
I was in bluegrass bands.

317
00:13:51,011 --> 00:13:53,560
I was in rock bands touring,
you know,

318
00:13:53,590 --> 00:13:55,180
in a pickup truck or something like
that.

319
00:13:55,181 --> 00:13:57,580
You know.
How old are you?

320
00:13:58,090 --> 00:14:00,700
I'm 39.
And how many years did you do that for?

321
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:01,630
A.
Well,

322
00:14:01,690 --> 00:14:06,690
I moved to Nashville when I was 23 and
probably the first three years I was in

323
00:14:07,211 --> 00:14:11,710
town,
I only wrote three times a day living,

324
00:14:11,740 --> 00:14:12,573
eating,
sleeping,

325
00:14:12,580 --> 00:14:13,720
breathing,
songwriting,

326
00:14:14,110 --> 00:14:15,590
trying to learn how to do that,
you know,

327
00:14:15,940 --> 00:14:18,610
in a way that kept me a job at a
publishing company.

328
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:20,590
So,
so how does that work when you get

329
00:14:20,591 --> 00:14:23,140
signed by a publishing company or you
get a job at a publishing company

330
00:14:23,141 --> 00:14:27,760
writing while you have your contract
labor deal,

331
00:14:27,790 --> 00:14:31,150
basically it's like you have a,
you sign a deal with,

332
00:14:31,900 --> 00:14:33,880
you know,
like you got a year and they get an

333
00:14:33,881 --> 00:14:36,490
option or two to pick it back up for
another couple of years.

334
00:14:36,490 --> 00:14:37,121
You know,
what,

335
00:14:37,121 --> 00:14:39,170
if one of those songs hits,
uh,

336
00:14:39,210 --> 00:14:41,320
you know,
those terms were worked out,

337
00:14:41,321 --> 00:14:43,990
whether you have,
what percentage of publishing they have,

338
00:14:44,060 --> 00:14:46,930
a percentage that you have and they pay
you a salary in exchange for,

339
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:48,850
you know,
because they're lucrative.

340
00:14:49,420 --> 00:14:50,290
It can be,
yeah,

341
00:14:50,530 --> 00:14:51,470
it can be,
you know,

342
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:56,150
if you have a bunch of songs on the
radio and so for you was,

343
00:14:56,151 --> 00:14:58,010
you were getting by doing this.
Well,

344
00:14:58,011 --> 00:15:00,620
I know I've made a very comfortable
living up to the point

345
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:07,400
about and what that allowed me to go out
and play bluegrass for next to no money

346
00:15:07,521 --> 00:15:11,330
or no play rock and roll and,
and have fun doing it and not worried

347
00:15:11,331 --> 00:15:13,040
about that being how I'm making a
living,

348
00:15:13,041 --> 00:15:14,570
you know,
but I've got to do it for the right

349
00:15:14,571 --> 00:15:16,970
reasons.
And so in a lot of ways,

350
00:15:17,170 --> 00:15:19,010
you know,
the songwriting thing,

351
00:15:20,020 --> 00:15:23,760
the commerce pay for the art I guess in,
in which I am a firm believer.

352
00:15:23,780 --> 00:15:26,510
And then some people were arguing this
is a conversation that struggle and I

353
00:15:26,570 --> 00:15:28,250
will have the commerce paying for the
art.

354
00:15:30,060 --> 00:15:31,910
But yeah.
So yeah,

355
00:15:31,930 --> 00:15:35,330
it's a,
it's a great thing.

356
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:35,941
It still is.
I,

357
00:15:35,941 --> 00:15:37,250
you know,
I still write songs for people.

358
00:15:37,251 --> 00:15:40,520
I still write with people when they
asked me to do that for because it's

359
00:15:40,521 --> 00:15:42,570
cool to get into somebody else's head,
you know,

360
00:15:42,571 --> 00:15:47,571
or a kind of sit down with them and try
to help them realize some vision of what

361
00:15:48,141 --> 00:15:51,230
it is they want to do.
And that's still one of my favorite

362
00:15:51,231 --> 00:15:54,650
things to do.
And I'm just as interested in that as I

363
00:15:54,651 --> 00:15:57,260
am in and doing my own thing a lot.
Wow.

364
00:15:57,261 --> 00:15:59,940
So when you learn how to write music,
um,

365
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:02,480
did you,
when you would write,

366
00:16:02,890 --> 00:16:05,810
will you sit,
do you sit down with an idea in mind

367
00:16:06,050 --> 00:16:06,980
with a guitar?

368
00:16:06,990 --> 00:16:09,380
Do you sit down with a pen and pad?
Like how do you,

369
00:16:09,410 --> 00:16:11,390
how do you write songs?
Well,

370
00:16:11,630 --> 00:16:15,110
if I'm riding by myself or with somebody
else because there's a lot of different

371
00:16:15,111 --> 00:16:17,200
processes it can be,
you know,

372
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:20,030
whatever comes up that day for me.
Generally,

373
00:16:20,031 --> 00:16:21,260
if I was just going to say,
Hey,

374
00:16:21,261 --> 00:16:23,480
I'm going to sit down and go over in
that corner and write a song,

375
00:16:23,481 --> 00:16:26,120
I'd have a guitar,
I'd probably have a legal pad and a pen

376
00:16:26,121 --> 00:16:30,620
much likely have sitting right here.
And I'd start strumming until that felt

377
00:16:30,621 --> 00:16:33,170
like something.
And how does that make me feel?

378
00:16:33,980 --> 00:16:36,050
I don't know.
Keep started humming the melody maybe.

379
00:16:36,110 --> 00:16:39,920
And hopefully somewhere in humming.
The melody of word would pop out that

380
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:44,450
are noise.
I would turn into a word.

381
00:16:44,451 --> 00:16:48,800
And from there you can kind of grow this
thing into whatever it is supposed to

382
00:16:48,801 --> 00:16:49,220
be.

383
00:16:49,220 --> 00:16:52,160
Now that that's how I would do it if I
was sitting around by myself.

384
00:16:52,190 --> 00:16:55,820
Now there's other times you and I could
be having a conversation and you could

385
00:16:55,821 --> 00:16:59,360
say a phrase or a line or,
or I could read a sign going down the

386
00:16:59,361 --> 00:16:59,970
road.
You know,

387
00:16:59,970 --> 00:17:01,910
if you're a songwriter,
you're always writing songs.

388
00:17:03,190 --> 00:17:05,750
It's not like a choice that you have.
It's like a,

389
00:17:05,810 --> 00:17:10,810
an affliction that you have in some way.
So you just kind of walking around a

390
00:17:11,090 --> 00:17:14,090
unconsciously things will hit you,
you know,

391
00:17:14,091 --> 00:17:16,940
and,
or moments will hit you or visual were

392
00:17:16,941 --> 00:17:19,430
hit you.
And that will spark something.

393
00:17:19,940 --> 00:17:21,860
So that's,
that's really,

394
00:17:22,390 --> 00:17:24,410
um,
it can come from anywhere.

395
00:17:24,411 --> 00:17:25,970
And that's.
And that's the truth.

396
00:17:27,110 --> 00:17:30,080
It sounds a lot like writing comedy.
I'm sure I don't,

397
00:17:30,081 --> 00:17:33,020
I personally cannot write comedy,
but I'm,

398
00:17:33,330 --> 00:17:36,380
I would think the creative process is
very much the same.

399
00:17:36,410 --> 00:17:39,800
You know,
you're trying to kind of take life and

400
00:17:39,830 --> 00:17:41,670
distilled into something,
you know,

401
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:45,890
that evokes an emotional response.
Do you sometimes sit down with a blank

402
00:17:45,891 --> 00:17:47,450
slate?
Like you have no idea what you want to

403
00:17:47,451 --> 00:17:49,500
talk about or write about.
Absolutely.

404
00:17:49,501 --> 00:17:51,810
And that's,
and that's back to the publishing deal

405
00:17:51,811 --> 00:17:52,290
thing.
That's,

406
00:17:52,290 --> 00:17:55,590
that was my job.
Like we would set appointments,

407
00:17:55,591 --> 00:17:59,490
we'd come in at noon and I have an
appointment with Ryder,

408
00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:01,193
ABC,
you know,

409
00:18:01,870 --> 00:18:04,380
we sit down and try to come up with
something.

410
00:18:05,220 --> 00:18:06,810
Wow,
that's got to be weird when you first

411
00:18:06,811 --> 00:18:09,720
worked with someone for the first time.
It's a lot of first dates.

412
00:18:09,810 --> 00:18:11,340
It's a lot of first days,
but you know,

413
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:15,780
you find out pretty quickly how you can
just kind of a

414
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:18,930
particular.
When you're right with writers who do

415
00:18:18,931 --> 00:18:20,130
that a lot,
uh,

416
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:23,310
you can very much walk into a room and
kind of throw all the,

417
00:18:24,130 --> 00:18:24,990
you know,
oh,

418
00:18:24,991 --> 00:18:25,430
how'd you do?

419
00:18:25,430 --> 00:18:26,750
And all that kind of answers.
They get the,

420
00:18:26,751 --> 00:18:28,440
you just get down to it and you'd just
be like,

421
00:18:29,070 --> 00:18:32,270
dive into it and start working on
something to,

422
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:33,240
Hey,
this is on my mind,

423
00:18:33,241 --> 00:18:35,260
but what do you think of this now?
That sucks,

424
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:38,670
you know,
and you have to be not nice a little bit

425
00:18:38,671 --> 00:18:41,790
to each other and you have to.
And even if you don't know each other

426
00:18:41,791 --> 00:18:43,980
well,
you have to act like you do in order to

427
00:18:43,981 --> 00:18:47,700
get to a spot where a song can,
can be something.

428
00:18:49,020 --> 00:18:51,630
And when do you ever write with no.
No,

429
00:18:51,930 --> 00:18:53,380
no guitar,
no music.

430
00:18:53,381 --> 00:18:54,690
Do you ever just have.
Absolutely.

431
00:18:55,020 --> 00:19:00,000
There's a song that I wrote on the,
on the travel record that we had a

432
00:19:00,030 --> 00:19:04,080
couple of records back traveler.
I wrote driving down the road,

433
00:19:05,220 --> 00:19:08,010
you know,
driving through the desert on interstate

434
00:19:08,011 --> 00:19:08,844
40,
you know,

435
00:19:09,090 --> 00:19:11,940
wrote the whole thing driving and then I
had to go figure out how to play it.

436
00:19:12,090 --> 00:19:15,170
Wow.
So as you're driving in your car,

437
00:19:15,210 --> 00:19:16,460
did you record it?
And I had,

438
00:19:16,520 --> 00:19:17,311
yeah,
I had a phone.

439
00:19:17,311 --> 00:19:22,311
This is just turn the voice recorder on
the phone and trying to,

440
00:19:24,421 --> 00:19:26,130
you know,
my wife was asleep in the seat next to

441
00:19:26,131 --> 00:19:27,600
him and I'm trying not to wake my wife
up.

442
00:19:27,601 --> 00:19:30,120
I'm being real quiet.
But yeah.

443
00:19:30,121 --> 00:19:35,121
And then you get it done and you put it
away and you go listen to it later and

444
00:19:35,330 --> 00:19:37,110
see what happens.
Wow.

445
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:40,620
So in all these years,
how many songs do you think you've

446
00:19:40,621 --> 00:19:45,621
written an excess of a thousand?
Probably somewhere like that.

447
00:19:46,020 --> 00:19:48,300
Do you have stacks of them?
Like laying around somewhere?

448
00:19:48,660 --> 00:19:51,240
I mean,
they're all cataloged at the publishing

449
00:19:51,241 --> 00:19:54,400
company I write for and they're all,
you know,

450
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:55,760
uh,
you know,

451
00:19:55,860 --> 00:19:58,960
accounted for for the most part and I
can kind of go back through them and dig

452
00:19:58,961 --> 00:19:59,910
in him if I need to.

453
00:20:00,060 --> 00:20:01,500
Would you do that?
Like for an album?

454
00:20:01,501 --> 00:20:04,160
Do you think this what I've been doing?
Yeah,

455
00:20:04,170 --> 00:20:04,751
all the,
you know,

456
00:20:04,751 --> 00:20:06,210
the,
this record we're putting out in the

457
00:20:06,211 --> 00:20:09,690
last record that we have out a safe or a
few covers.

458
00:20:09,691 --> 00:20:11,720
They're all songs that are,
you know,

459
00:20:11,750 --> 00:20:13,590
a decade old or something.
Wow.

460
00:20:13,591 --> 00:20:14,600
No kidding.
Yeah.

461
00:20:14,940 --> 00:20:16,770
So might as well get stoned.
How long is that one?

462
00:20:16,950 --> 00:20:18,150
Oh God,
that song is

463
00:20:19,730 --> 00:20:21,030
a,
it's probably one of the first songs I

464
00:20:21,031 --> 00:20:23,730
wrote when I moved to town,
so I was probably 25 when I wrote that.

465
00:20:23,731 --> 00:20:26,880
So yeah,
it's 13 years old,

466
00:20:27,390 --> 00:20:29,670
something like that too.
I love that song.

467
00:20:30,060 --> 00:20:31,860
I love all your songs,
but I'm a big fan.

468
00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:36,810
Thank you.
So when you are on tour and now I'm a,

469
00:20:36,870 --> 00:20:38,630
are you bringing your own opening acts
with you,

470
00:20:38,631 --> 00:20:40,450
you deciding who comes out with you?
Yeah,

471
00:20:40,451 --> 00:20:42,810
well we,
we try to pick people that we know and

472
00:20:42,811 --> 00:20:45,870
love and uh,
and we think,

473
00:20:45,930 --> 00:20:49,030
you know,
fit or we would just want to support,

474
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:50,920
you know,
and uh,

475
00:20:51,070 --> 00:20:53,700
you have a lot of great people out on
the road with CSI.

476
00:20:53,750 --> 00:20:57,010
We have Brent cobb and Margo price and
uh,

477
00:20:57,011 --> 00:21:00,300
Anderson the east and uh,
Marty Stewart just,

478
00:21:00,370 --> 00:21:01,930
you know,
there's a lot of people that we love.

479
00:21:02,570 --> 00:21:03,950
If you do,
have you listened to Ben and Brent

480
00:21:04,230 --> 00:21:04,850
branch?
Nice.

481
00:21:04,850 --> 00:21:06,360
Those.
Now I'm going to write this down

482
00:21:06,361 --> 00:21:07,130
afterwards.
Yeah,

483
00:21:07,130 --> 00:21:09,480
you gave me some suggestions.
Yeah,

484
00:21:09,481 --> 00:21:10,261
you'll dig it.
It's,

485
00:21:10,261 --> 00:21:11,310
it's good stuff.
Well,

486
00:21:11,311 --> 00:21:15,270
birds of a feather flock together and I
know you type of dudes probably only

487
00:21:15,330 --> 00:21:18,900
like other legit type of people,
so I'd probably get some good data.

488
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:20,880
Well I can't guess.
Yeah,

489
00:21:21,490 --> 00:21:22,430
now my,
we,

490
00:21:22,450 --> 00:21:24,660
we love,
we love music and we like,

491
00:21:24,780 --> 00:21:25,613
we like to support.

492
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:30,070
There's something about the art form of
music that has always been very

493
00:21:30,071 --> 00:21:33,760
inspirational to me and I've always
drawn upon it for.

494
00:21:33,761 --> 00:21:36,640
I'm like,
you know that hunter s thompson quote

495
00:21:36,730 --> 00:21:39,070
about music being fuel.
Ever seen that quote,

496
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:42,450
I'm not sure.
CV pull.

497
00:21:42,530 --> 00:21:44,680
It's on my instagram page from pretty
recently.

498
00:21:45,130 --> 00:21:50,130
Um,
when I was listening to Gary Clark Jr

499
00:21:50,231 --> 00:21:51,670
just a couple of days ago.
Dude,

500
00:21:51,671 --> 00:21:53,390
that guy can play.
Fuck

501
00:21:55,150 --> 00:21:56,620
that guy.
That guy's a freak.

502
00:21:56,740 --> 00:21:58,330
He was with honey honey.
Best Way.

503
00:21:58,360 --> 00:21:59,560
Yeah.
And uh,

504
00:21:59,620 --> 00:22:02,160
they did a version of midnight rider.
Yeah.

505
00:22:02,170 --> 00:22:03,460
Here,
music has always been a matter of

506
00:22:03,461 --> 00:22:04,180
energy.
To me,

507
00:22:04,180 --> 00:22:07,570
a question of fuel.
Sentimental people call it inspiration,

508
00:22:07,571 --> 00:22:10,960
but what they really mean is fuel.
I've always needed fuel.

509
00:22:10,990 --> 00:22:14,560
I'm a serious consumer on some nights I
still believe that a car,

510
00:22:14,561 --> 00:22:18,670
but the gas needle on empty can run
about 50 more miles if you have the

511
00:22:18,671 --> 00:22:20,620
right music.
Very loud on the radio.

512
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:22,233
I liked it.

513
00:22:23,980 --> 00:22:25,760
I liked music in the car myself.
That's it.

514
00:22:25,900 --> 00:22:28,960
So it's,
it's uniquely inspirational.

515
00:22:28,990 --> 00:22:33,700
Like very few things.
And the art of music and music creation

516
00:22:33,730 --> 00:22:35,140
is such a,
um,

517
00:22:36,910 --> 00:22:39,240
I think when it's done correctly,
I should say is a,

518
00:22:39,270 --> 00:22:43,360
it's a very pure art form in the sense
that the people that are doing it are

519
00:22:43,361 --> 00:22:48,130
really like digging into their creative
engines and you know,

520
00:22:48,131 --> 00:22:52,300
just getting the gears turning and
pulling these things out and it

521
00:22:52,330 --> 00:22:57,330
represents like however much burden you
have in your personality,

522
00:22:58,451 --> 00:23:01,690
in your life and you're like,
that can either help you or hurt you in

523
00:23:01,691 --> 00:23:04,300
this process.
And some people's music sort of

524
00:23:04,301 --> 00:23:08,680
represents the torment of their life and
some people's music represents the

525
00:23:08,681 --> 00:23:12,100
purity of their vision,
but it's all has different effects on

526
00:23:12,101 --> 00:23:14,050
people and some sort of strange and
bizarre way.

527
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:16,050
Yeah.
I'd like to say that,

528
00:23:16,310 --> 00:23:18,660
you know,
the songs I was talking about the

529
00:23:18,661 --> 00:23:19,770
effort,
what else talking about this,

530
00:23:19,771 --> 00:23:24,771
but I like songs that allow you to take
ownership of them and make them personal

531
00:23:27,541 --> 00:23:29,250
to you.
Does that make sense?

532
00:23:29,730 --> 00:23:34,730
And I like listening to,
and I think that's probably what we all

533
00:23:35,131 --> 00:23:39,330
like about songs eventually is our
ability to relate to them,

534
00:23:39,331 --> 00:23:44,331
but also they in and they become like a,
I come back and write a song I can play

535
00:23:44,341 --> 00:23:47,480
a song on,
but it doesn't really mean anything

536
00:23:47,481 --> 00:23:51,650
until somebody listens to it and then
they're uh,

537
00:23:51,710 --> 00:23:54,770
you know,
perception of what that song is about in

538
00:23:54,771 --> 00:23:57,210
relation to them comes back at us,
you know,

539
00:23:57,740 --> 00:24:00,530
on a stage or it comes or lives in the
world that way.

540
00:24:00,531 --> 00:24:02,150
And,
and that's so cool.

541
00:24:02,151 --> 00:24:02,620
To me,
that's,

542
00:24:02,620 --> 00:24:04,550
that's the,
that's the thing that makes a song

543
00:24:05,090 --> 00:24:05,570
complete.

544
00:24:05,570 --> 00:24:09,200
I don't feel like they're even done
until somebody listens to it and

545
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:11,770
attaches to it.
That's,

546
00:24:11,860 --> 00:24:15,020
that's the thing that I love so much
about songs.

547
00:24:16,220 --> 00:24:18,650
Yeah.
And everybody's thing is different too,

548
00:24:18,651 --> 00:24:21,620
right?
It's like you could have two songs that

549
00:24:21,621 --> 00:24:24,560
are the exact same song,
but there's sung by different people and

550
00:24:24,561 --> 00:24:28,670
they have a completely different feeling
or some certain covers he listen to a

551
00:24:28,671 --> 00:24:30,290
certain coverage just like,
Whoa,

552
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:33,410
just has it.
It just hits you in a totally different

553
00:24:33,411 --> 00:24:34,011
way.
Yeah,

554
00:24:34,011 --> 00:24:35,460
absolutely.
But,

555
00:24:35,570 --> 00:24:38,130
and then the other side of that is,
you know,

556
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:41,450
two different people can listen to the
same version of a song and it means

557
00:24:41,451 --> 00:24:45,620
totally different things to them because
they attached the pieces of their life

558
00:24:45,621 --> 00:24:48,360
to it in a way that is unique to them.
And that's,

559
00:24:48,530 --> 00:24:51,240
that's the coolest thing in world.
Yeah.

560
00:24:51,330 --> 00:24:53,180
It's interactive in some sort of a weird
way,

561
00:24:53,181 --> 00:24:53,600
right?

562
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:54,560
Yeah,
absolutely.

563
00:24:54,730 --> 00:24:57,380
And if it's not,
it's nothing exists.

564
00:24:57,530 --> 00:25:00,840
What I mean by like sometimes people's
music represents sort of the tournament

565
00:25:00,841 --> 00:25:03,770
is going on their own personal.
What I was thinking specifically,

566
00:25:03,771 --> 00:25:07,340
I was amy winehouse,
like I was a big amy winehouse fan and

567
00:25:07,341 --> 00:25:08,600
there's something about sash,
great.

568
00:25:08,690 --> 00:25:11,840
Fucking phenomenal.
There's something about that Rehab Song

569
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:16,680
because she put that Rehab Song out when
everyone knew she was a mess right in.

570
00:25:16,900 --> 00:25:20,900
And then she still tried to make me go
to rehab.

571
00:25:20,901 --> 00:25:22,060
I said,
no,

572
00:25:22,061 --> 00:25:24,230
you made it sound happening.
She's like,

573
00:25:24,231 --> 00:25:25,760
fuck it.
I'm riding this thing right into the

574
00:25:25,761 --> 00:25:26,630
beach.
Right.

575
00:25:26,660 --> 00:25:28,430
I'm not stopping for the rocks.
Right.

576
00:25:28,460 --> 00:25:29,770
I'm hitting the throttle.
You're gonna.

577
00:25:29,780 --> 00:25:31,280
See where this goes.
It was tragic,

578
00:25:31,281 --> 00:25:34,700
but it produced some,
some phenomenal music.

579
00:25:34,701 --> 00:25:35,421
No doubt.
Yeah,

580
00:25:35,421 --> 00:25:39,800
there was something to it.
There was like almost a fatalistic

581
00:25:39,980 --> 00:25:43,060
acceptance of our own fate or something
like,

582
00:25:43,550 --> 00:25:46,910
well,
and we can listen to it in that

583
00:25:46,911 --> 00:25:49,010
perspective now that she's with us
anymore,

584
00:25:49,011 --> 00:25:52,550
but you know,
at the time it was a lot of teenage

585
00:25:52,551 --> 00:25:54,910
angst,
celebratory.

586
00:25:55,460 --> 00:25:58,530
It felt celebratory of the time on the
other side of,

587
00:25:58,570 --> 00:26:00,320
of,
of the tragedy of it.

588
00:26:00,980 --> 00:26:04,950
It has a little more weight I think.
Yeah,

589
00:26:04,970 --> 00:26:06,000
for sure.
But I mean,

590
00:26:06,020 --> 00:26:08,270
man,
if you stop and think about how many

591
00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:11,570
tortured souls put out unbelievable
music,

592
00:26:11,710 --> 00:26:12,543
oh,
I think it's,

593
00:26:12,760 --> 00:26:13,880
you know,
to some degree,

594
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:16,540
some of the greats,
you know,

595
00:26:16,610 --> 00:26:19,400
it's almost like a requirement that they
are a little bit out there,

596
00:26:20,220 --> 00:26:21,410
you know.
And so,

597
00:26:21,540 --> 00:26:23,520
um,
which is,

598
00:26:24,010 --> 00:26:29,010
it's a horrible thing for them,
but it's a beautiful thing for the rest

599
00:26:29,091 --> 00:26:30,770
of us who get to listen to it.
Yeah,

600
00:26:30,771 --> 00:26:32,290
right.
Man,

601
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:34,160
it's just the,
uh,

602
00:26:34,690 --> 00:26:37,960
just to be an artist in any form,
right.

603
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,910
Requires all this vulnerability and just
trying to,

604
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:44,220
trying to find whatever it is when

605
00:26:44,220 --> 00:26:46,680
you're trying to create something where,
where is that coming from?

606
00:26:46,681 --> 00:26:49,830
The ether.
The Muse is trying to just find that

607
00:26:49,831 --> 00:26:52,740
thing.
And then when you're dealing with your

608
00:26:52,741 --> 00:26:56,310
own personal demons,
like especially the deep drug demons

609
00:26:56,370 --> 00:26:58,890
seem to produce some of the most insane
music ever.

610
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:02,250
You know,
you think Hendrix and Kurt cobain.

611
00:27:02,280 --> 00:27:04,260
Absolutely.
And You keep going down that list

612
00:27:04,261 --> 00:27:05,094
forever.
Really?

613
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:05,970
Yeah.
And,

614
00:27:05,970 --> 00:27:09,100
and I have,
I have a songwriter friend who is

615
00:27:09,101 --> 00:27:14,101
convinced that you can't really produce
something that is really noteworthy

616
00:27:15,701 --> 00:27:18,100
unless you have some kind of an
addiction issue.

617
00:27:18,160 --> 00:27:19,300
So really?
Yeah.

618
00:27:19,370 --> 00:27:20,203
Uh,
but,

619
00:27:20,220 --> 00:27:22,300
uh,
I don't know if that's true,

620
00:27:22,301 --> 00:27:24,580
but you know,
if you're saying that very thing,

621
00:27:24,581 --> 00:27:27,910
you know,
like you look back at a history of rock

622
00:27:27,911 --> 00:27:30,030
and roll and music in general,
you know,

623
00:27:30,610 --> 00:27:32,200
there's a lot of heavy drugs and a lot
of,

624
00:27:32,570 --> 00:27:33,580
uh,
you know,

625
00:27:33,850 --> 00:27:36,390
getting out there on the edge.
Yeah.

626
00:27:37,030 --> 00:27:39,820
Has in fact reduced some of the greatest
music that we've ever heard.

627
00:27:40,120 --> 00:27:43,390
He also can hear it in the music,
like Stevie Ray Vaughan is a great

628
00:27:43,391 --> 00:27:45,100
example.
He like here,

629
00:27:45,101 --> 00:27:48,250
the getting out there on the edge in the
music.

630
00:27:48,280 --> 00:27:51,610
Absolutely you.
You hear it with every ounce of

631
00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:52,473
everything in it.

632
00:27:52,760 --> 00:27:55,010
There's no safety net and that kind of
music.

633
00:27:55,011 --> 00:27:58,490
This is just says all raw.
Yep,

634
00:27:59,630 --> 00:28:01,400
absolutely.
You kinda crazy life,

635
00:28:01,401 --> 00:28:03,140
man.
It's a crazy way to make a living.

636
00:28:03,350 --> 00:28:05,090
It is a crazy.
Be Super Happy.

637
00:28:06,410 --> 00:28:08,290
I don't have any of those issues.
I don't know,

638
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:10,640
but you don't have to have any of those
issues.

639
00:28:10,641 --> 00:28:13,370
I don't think you have to have an
addiction issue to be great.

640
00:28:13,371 --> 00:28:15,340
I just think you just have to pursue it.
Yeah.

641
00:28:15,770 --> 00:28:17,870
You know what?
Maybe maybe the addiction.

642
00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:19,600
I mean there's,
there can be healthy addictions.

643
00:28:20,420 --> 00:28:23,360
I think that's true.
I think everybody would look at it.

644
00:28:24,050 --> 00:28:28,800
Most people that I meet that are
successful in one way or another,

645
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:33,020
they have at the very least kind of
obsessive tendencies about something

646
00:28:33,410 --> 00:28:36,260
bright and generally it's some part of
the work.

647
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:38,120
But uh,
yeah,

648
00:28:38,150 --> 00:28:40,910
it's uh,
and focus.

649
00:28:40,911 --> 00:28:44,780
I see a lot of focus,
like this kind of super focused thing

650
00:28:44,781 --> 00:28:47,420
that when you,
when you see certain people,

651
00:28:47,421 --> 00:28:48,111
you're like,
oh,

652
00:28:48,111 --> 00:28:51,380
that's why he can do that,
because he or she can do that,

653
00:28:51,410 --> 00:28:53,930
that they have this ability to focus.

654
00:28:54,690 --> 00:28:55,523
Yeah.
There's A.

655
00:28:55,890 --> 00:28:59,610
I've always been amazed too,
when someone can take an instrument and

656
00:28:59,611 --> 00:29:03,030
make that instrument sound very specific
to them.

657
00:29:03,390 --> 00:29:05,430
Like Gary Clark Jr is another good
example of that.

658
00:29:05,910 --> 00:29:06,743
Like,
um,

659
00:29:07,500 --> 00:29:10,920
see if you can find that video that I've
put up on my instagram way back when

660
00:29:10,921 --> 00:29:11,754
with honey.
Honey,

661
00:29:12,840 --> 00:29:15,930
honey,
honey and Gary Clark jr performed this

662
00:29:15,931 --> 00:29:20,931
really tiny place in downtown la about
maybe a year ago and they did a midnight

663
00:29:22,561 --> 00:29:24,420
set on like a Wednesday night or some
shit.

664
00:29:24,510 --> 00:29:28,440
And uh,
Gary Clark is up there doing the almond

665
00:29:28,441 --> 00:29:30,330
brothers midnight rider,
like,

666
00:29:30,331 --> 00:29:31,164
listen to this and

667
00:29:41,820 --> 00:29:43,280
do you know what I'm saying?
Like that

668
00:29:44,890 --> 00:29:49,890
sound.
That's a perfect example.

669
00:30:25,121 --> 00:30:27,610
What I'm talking about,
like that is him.

670
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:31,190
That is him.
But it's also everybody this beforehand,

671
00:30:32,070 --> 00:30:37,070
that he's probably the one guy that we
have in modern times that really can

672
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:42,770
carry that torch for the blues and,
and,

673
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:44,230
you know,
all those great,

674
00:30:45,090 --> 00:30:48,380
you know,
great guitar players that we don't have

675
00:30:48,381 --> 00:30:49,490
a lot of them left,
you know,

676
00:30:49,491 --> 00:30:50,800
like,
um,

677
00:30:50,910 --> 00:30:51,351
and he,
he,

678
00:30:51,351 --> 00:30:52,580
he can do that.
And,

679
00:30:52,620 --> 00:30:53,840
and,
and that's a real kind of,

680
00:30:54,340 --> 00:30:56,030
you know,
bb king approached,

681
00:30:56,060 --> 00:30:58,970
you know,
just plans when real straight line

682
00:30:58,971 --> 00:30:59,870
stuff.
But then he can,

683
00:30:59,900 --> 00:31:03,350
he can do Hendrix and all you gotta be
crazy and psychedelic to,

684
00:31:03,380 --> 00:31:05,630
he can do any of that.
And that's,

685
00:31:05,650 --> 00:31:07,100
you know,
that guy shines.

686
00:31:07,101 --> 00:31:08,960
And when you,
when you step on a stage with him,

687
00:31:08,961 --> 00:31:10,540
you know,
it's uh,

688
00:31:10,970 --> 00:31:11,960
we play,
we played,

689
00:31:12,020 --> 00:31:15,740
he and I and Bonnie Raitt played a bb
king tribute on the grammy's few years

690
00:31:15,741 --> 00:31:18,890
back.
And that was intimidating because,

691
00:31:20,840 --> 00:31:23,810
you know,
Bonnie rates excellent in her own way,

692
00:31:23,811 --> 00:31:24,920
you know,
like she has,

693
00:31:25,310 --> 00:31:28,550
she has that thing just like he has
where it's just like those,

694
00:31:28,760 --> 00:31:32,300
those people are there special people.

695
00:31:32,510 --> 00:31:33,950
Yeah.
Yeah.

696
00:31:33,951 --> 00:31:37,220
I agree.
And there's something about them that,

697
00:31:37,221 --> 00:31:39,290
like what hunter was saying,
that their fuel,

698
00:31:40,190 --> 00:31:42,710
like I saw that and I ran home and I
wrote,

699
00:31:42,711 --> 00:31:44,510
I wrote for like three hours.
Yeah.

700
00:31:44,570 --> 00:31:46,070
So it just was pumped up.
I just,

701
00:31:46,130 --> 00:31:48,980
I just felt like I'd seen something,
you know,

702
00:31:49,520 --> 00:31:53,300
like I just,
I touched some new dimension.

703
00:31:53,950 --> 00:31:56,090
You listened to a lot of Freddie King.
You're listening to Freddie King?

704
00:31:56,120 --> 00:31:57,820
No.
Oh no man.

705
00:31:57,821 --> 00:32:00,020
You right.
This time I'm gonna start writing down.

706
00:32:00,050 --> 00:32:02,030
You got to get on Freddie King.
Freddy King.

707
00:32:02,250 --> 00:32:03,440
What,
what kind of Shit is he?

708
00:32:03,680 --> 00:32:04,800
He's blues.
Yeah,

709
00:32:04,970 --> 00:32:05,750
yeah,
yeah.

710
00:32:05,750 --> 00:32:06,950
He's,
he's not with us anymore.

711
00:32:06,951 --> 00:32:08,170
But Oh,
uh,

712
00:32:08,290 --> 00:32:10,880
you know,
there's bb King Albert King and Freddie

713
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:12,290
King.
And I never heard of Freddy.

714
00:32:12,350 --> 00:32:14,690
Oh,
well you've probably ever seen that

715
00:32:14,691 --> 00:32:15,524
show,
uh,

716
00:32:15,530 --> 00:32:16,860
eastbound and down.
You know,

717
00:32:16,940 --> 00:32:18,440
the same theme song at the front of
that.

718
00:32:18,470 --> 00:32:19,303
Yeah,
that's right.

719
00:32:19,460 --> 00:32:21,430
Oh,
okay.

720
00:32:21,500 --> 00:32:23,770
But then I love Freddy King.
Yeah,

721
00:32:23,780 --> 00:32:24,613
there's a,
there's a,

722
00:32:24,920 --> 00:32:28,070
there's a wealth of,
of fuel if you want some,

723
00:32:28,780 --> 00:32:30,110
uh,
and Freddie King,

724
00:32:30,160 --> 00:32:31,370
that's,
that's a pretty,

725
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:36,590
a standard staple of,
of listening for me.

726
00:32:36,591 --> 00:32:38,690
If I go,
if I want to turn something on and,

727
00:32:39,290 --> 00:32:41,960
but it made me feel right,
Freddie,

728
00:32:41,961 --> 00:32:44,600
Freddie King,
I got to John Lee Hooker problem.

729
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:47,840
When I start thinking about blues,
I just listened to Johnny Hooker.

730
00:32:47,850 --> 00:32:50,090
I've so much.
John Lee Hooker on my phone.

731
00:32:50,091 --> 00:32:51,840
I have no room for other people.
Now you gotTa,

732
00:32:51,841 --> 00:32:55,100
you gotta get you gotta get Freddy King
and Freddie King in there.

733
00:32:55,101 --> 00:32:56,690
But when I,
when I'm tired,

734
00:32:56,691 --> 00:32:58,310
I don't feel like working out.
I put boom,

735
00:32:58,311 --> 00:33:00,440
boom,
boom on and woo.

736
00:33:00,470 --> 00:33:02,690
Here we go.
We're off to the races.

737
00:33:03,820 --> 00:33:07,820
It's just something about those types of
songs,

738
00:33:07,821 --> 00:33:09,830
you know,
that deep blues.

739
00:33:09,860 --> 00:33:13,760
It's just got this extra special soul to
it,

740
00:33:13,940 --> 00:33:14,840
you know,
there's just a,

741
00:33:15,540 --> 00:33:19,280
you're in sort of immersed in the
feeling of those people,

742
00:33:19,310 --> 00:33:20,350
you know,
it's uh,

743
00:33:20,630 --> 00:33:21,920
it's heavy duty stuff,
man.

744
00:33:22,430 --> 00:33:24,050
Music is heavy duty stuff,
man.

745
00:33:24,750 --> 00:33:26,870
Um,
how fortunate do you feel?

746
00:33:27,390 --> 00:33:28,820
Uh,
I'm the luckiest man in the world.

747
00:33:29,570 --> 00:33:31,550
I say that all the time.
And it's true.

748
00:33:31,580 --> 00:33:33,740
I am absolutely the luckiest dude in the
world.

749
00:33:34,370 --> 00:33:36,400
I would imagine you feel that way.
Yeah.

750
00:33:36,401 --> 00:33:38,060
I mean,
you found that it's actually true.

751
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:40,070
I think I'm the luckiest guy in the
world,

752
00:33:40,071 --> 00:33:42,100
but I'll let you slide.
Well,

753
00:33:42,150 --> 00:33:44,660
I'm top five,
top five.

754
00:33:44,990 --> 00:33:47,060
I think we're all the luckiest person in
the world.

755
00:33:47,090 --> 00:33:50,960
If you're actually found your thing that
you like to do and you don't really,

756
00:33:51,070 --> 00:33:52,700
you work,
but you don't really work.

757
00:33:52,701 --> 00:33:54,110
Work well.
Yeah.

758
00:33:54,260 --> 00:33:54,861
I mean,
listen,

759
00:33:54,861 --> 00:33:56,030
I do a lot.
We do a lot.

760
00:33:56,031 --> 00:33:59,810
We've got to work.
It's work in the sense of it's time

761
00:33:59,811 --> 00:34:00,710
consuming.
Yes.

762
00:34:00,770 --> 00:34:02,360
It requires effort and focus,
but I.

763
00:34:02,361 --> 00:34:04,220
Yes.
But listen,

764
00:34:05,480 --> 00:34:09,470
there's nothing else I would rather do
for a living and I'm grateful and

765
00:34:09,471 --> 00:34:14,120
thankful everyday for it because I love
it when you could tell.

766
00:34:14,300 --> 00:34:15,740
I mean,
it really comes out in your music,

767
00:34:16,040 --> 00:34:18,800
really tell it's pure.
Do you,

768
00:34:18,801 --> 00:34:20,330
uh,
do you listen to any classical,

769
00:34:20,650 --> 00:34:21,860
the classical music?
Yeah.

770
00:34:21,980 --> 00:34:22,750
I,
you know,

771
00:34:22,750 --> 00:34:26,180
when I was a kid I used to listen to
more classical music than I do now,

772
00:34:26,240 --> 00:34:29,090
but you know,
I enjoy occasionally going to the

773
00:34:29,091 --> 00:34:29,930
symphony,
you know,

774
00:34:30,160 --> 00:34:32,110
but I haven't gone in years,
but I,

775
00:34:32,111 --> 00:34:32,650
I,
I,

776
00:34:32,650 --> 00:34:36,470
I do like that music it,
it moves me in a different kind of way

777
00:34:36,500 --> 00:34:38,780
than listening to different gang would.
But all right,

778
00:34:38,781 --> 00:34:42,050
here's the big question.
Jazz jazz.

779
00:34:42,051 --> 00:34:46,550
I do like jazz music,
not necessarily like super experimental

780
00:34:46,970 --> 00:34:50,480
jazz music that gets way,
way out there like acid jazz,

781
00:34:51,060 --> 00:34:53,370
like Coltrane,
like just.

782
00:34:53,500 --> 00:34:55,160
Yeah.
And once again,

783
00:34:55,161 --> 00:34:59,060
I am not a uh,
in no way am I an authority on jazz,

784
00:34:59,061 --> 00:35:02,750
but if it's on I'm,
I will enjoy it because I enjoy as a

785
00:35:02,751 --> 00:35:03,290
musician.

786
00:35:03,290 --> 00:35:06,170
I enjoyed just like I hear enjoy great
blues players.

787
00:35:06,171 --> 00:35:07,670
There's so many great musicians and
jazz,

788
00:35:07,671 --> 00:35:11,240
like I had an opportunity to rush songs.
Damn Wilson

789
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:17,570
called me up one time to go write some
songs for the preservation hall jazz

790
00:35:17,571 --> 00:35:19,850
band.
And so we wrote some songs.

791
00:35:21,650 --> 00:35:23,430
I knew nothing about New Orleans jazz,
what's,

792
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:24,200
what,
uh,

793
00:35:24,200 --> 00:35:24,950
whatsoever.
And,

794
00:35:24,950 --> 00:35:28,850
but I went down to New Orleans and I
participated in this and wrote these

795
00:35:28,851 --> 00:35:32,700
songs that now live in the jazz world so
that,

796
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:36,800
that really is thrilling to me to get to
that thing I was telling you about where

797
00:35:36,801 --> 00:35:39,690
I get,
go hop into somebody else's space and

798
00:35:40,260 --> 00:35:41,510
see if I'm helpful,
you know,

799
00:35:41,530 --> 00:35:43,500
that's,
that's cool to me.

800
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:44,850
You know,
so now I have,

801
00:35:45,380 --> 00:35:49,200
you know,
I have that it feels like to me like

802
00:35:49,201 --> 00:35:51,900
that's a feather in my cap.
I got to go participate with those guys.

803
00:35:51,901 --> 00:35:53,190
And they're so great.
Every one of them.

804
00:35:53,710 --> 00:35:57,040
I have some friends that love that sort
of collaboration thing too,

805
00:35:57,041 --> 00:36:00,340
whether it's in music or I have a good
buddy of mine who writes a lot for my

806
00:36:00,341 --> 00:36:02,560
friend.
Tony Hinchcliffe writes a lot for people

807
00:36:02,561 --> 00:36:05,860
for uh,
for roasts and he does punch up on shows

808
00:36:05,861 --> 00:36:08,620
and things along those lines.
But he relishes that opportunity.

809
00:36:08,860 --> 00:36:11,560
He likes collaborating,
likes helping people out on stuff.

810
00:36:11,620 --> 00:36:14,110
Yeah.
Well this gives you the opportunity to

811
00:36:14,920 --> 00:36:16,930
flush your mind in a way that maybe you
wouldn't.

812
00:36:17,110 --> 00:36:18,820
Yeah.
In your own space,

813
00:36:18,821 --> 00:36:21,820
you know,
what do you do when you're not doing

814
00:36:21,821 --> 00:36:22,654
music?

815
00:36:22,950 --> 00:36:27,950
That's all I do pretty much really,
that I play music and I'm uh,

816
00:36:28,651 --> 00:36:29,081
you know,
I,

817
00:36:29,081 --> 00:36:31,800
I like to,
I have things I like to do.

818
00:36:31,801 --> 00:36:32,160
I like,
you know,

819
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:35,940
I like to fish,
but I don't get to do that a whole lot.

820
00:36:35,950 --> 00:36:36,870
Bass fish.
What do you do?

821
00:36:37,380 --> 00:36:39,140
I grew up in a trout stream.
Oh yeah.

822
00:36:39,570 --> 00:36:42,810
I'm not a philosopher in Kentucky,
but not a fly fisherman,

823
00:36:42,811 --> 00:36:44,660
but a spinning tackle.
Yeah.

824
00:36:44,670 --> 00:36:47,560
Just spend a tackle.
I used to use a little ultra lot.

825
00:36:47,720 --> 00:36:52,020
Spending my summers were spent as a kid.
I'd be in being the creek at 5:30,

826
00:36:52,021 --> 00:36:52,590
you know,

827
00:36:52,590 --> 00:36:56,250
my friend Steve Renaud was just talking
to a famous writer recently and his last

828
00:36:56,251 --> 00:36:57,780
podcast,
I don't remember the man's name,

829
00:36:57,781 --> 00:37:02,781
but he's famous in the fishing writing
world and he's a fly fisherman and he's

830
00:37:03,691 --> 00:37:05,370
like,
he had a really interesting question.

831
00:37:05,371 --> 00:37:07,020
He said,
why is so much great,

832
00:37:07,021 --> 00:37:12,021
great literature attached to fly fishing
but not to spin tackle.

833
00:37:13,830 --> 00:37:15,400
It's true.
That's a good question.

834
00:37:15,401 --> 00:37:16,570
And I,
I think,

835
00:37:17,130 --> 00:37:18,400
uh,
that's the,

836
00:37:18,460 --> 00:37:19,360
that's the,
uh,

837
00:37:20,020 --> 00:37:23,380
I dunno,
it's Kinda like using spend tackles like

838
00:37:23,381 --> 00:37:25,820
this a workman.
It's,

839
00:37:25,821 --> 00:37:28,210
it's,
it's like a blue collar way of doing it

840
00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:33,040
or that's my perception of it.
And then people who were fly fishermen

841
00:37:33,041 --> 00:37:34,720
and I've seen these guys in action,
you know,

842
00:37:34,750 --> 00:37:35,770
use a fly Rod.
It,

843
00:37:35,830 --> 00:37:37,540
there's an art to it,
but there's an art,

844
00:37:37,720 --> 00:37:40,330
there's an art to using the all,
all of it.

845
00:37:40,331 --> 00:37:43,960
But the gas,
we were fly fishermen and take a lot

846
00:37:43,961 --> 00:37:47,380
more pride in the art of it.
Yeah.

847
00:37:47,700 --> 00:37:48,320
And the,
and the,

848
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:50,160
and this.
And please forgive me,

849
00:37:50,170 --> 00:37:53,080
fishermen out there if I'm,
if I'm misrepresenting it,

850
00:37:53,081 --> 00:37:55,000
anybody who likes to do either of these
things,

851
00:37:55,001 --> 00:38:00,001
but my perception of it is a
gas with a spinning reel.

852
00:38:02,381 --> 00:38:03,850
And then me,
I just want to catch the fish.

853
00:38:04,940 --> 00:38:07,180
I'm not,
if it means I'm flipping it out there,

854
00:38:07,181 --> 00:38:10,180
if it means I'm tossing it,
if it means I'm jake fishing with it

855
00:38:11,020 --> 00:38:12,560
doesn't matter.
I figuring

856
00:38:12,700 --> 00:38:15,670
out the way to catch the fish.
The fly fishermen,

857
00:38:15,730 --> 00:38:17,430
they liked the process.
Yeah.

858
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:21,220
I started out with a,
a spinning Rod.

859
00:38:21,550 --> 00:38:24,040
Um,
I actually started out with Zeb,

860
00:38:24,170 --> 00:38:27,400
Co push buttons,
Spin Caster Jammies,

861
00:38:28,090 --> 00:38:32,230
and then uh,
then I went to bait casting reel and

862
00:38:32,231 --> 00:38:36,460
then for bass,
and then when I into trout fishing I

863
00:38:36,461 --> 00:38:39,910
eventually moved on to fly fishing and I
learned how to tie some flies.

864
00:38:39,911 --> 00:38:42,270
And let's say you're serious about it.
So I'm sitting here talking about your.

865
00:38:42,440 --> 00:38:43,570
No,
that's your hobby.

866
00:38:43,571 --> 00:38:48,100
It's been a long time now when I fish I
fish maybe once a year,

867
00:38:48,101 --> 00:38:51,010
like on vacation.
That's especially when it happens for me

868
00:38:51,011 --> 00:38:52,160
is I,
you know,

869
00:38:53,130 --> 00:38:54,400
you know,
charter,

870
00:38:54,401 --> 00:38:57,640
a guy on a boat somewhere to go easy.
It's fun.

871
00:38:57,641 --> 00:38:59,350
Yeah.
I've done it in Hawaii,

872
00:38:59,380 --> 00:39:01,870
in Mexico.
And the great thing is like say if you

873
00:39:01,871 --> 00:39:04,750
stay at a resort that either like you
could run a boat,

874
00:39:04,751 --> 00:39:07,030
they'll take you out,
you catch a tune or something like that,

875
00:39:07,031 --> 00:39:09,040
and then you cook it and eat it for
lunch and it's amazing.

876
00:39:09,640 --> 00:39:10,473
That's great.
Yeah.

877
00:39:10,930 --> 00:39:13,020
That's about the extent that my fishing
these days,

878
00:39:13,120 --> 00:39:16,300
my other outdoor activities are sort of
overwhelmed my fishing time,

879
00:39:16,301 --> 00:39:21,100
but there's something about the people
that get into fly fishing that it's not

880
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:23,440
just fishing with.
One of the weird things about fly

881
00:39:23,441 --> 00:39:26,380
fishing is a lot of them let the fish
go.

882
00:39:26,680 --> 00:39:29,080
There's a lot of catch and release going
on with fly fishing,

883
00:39:29,140 --> 00:39:31,600
which I mean I'm.
I liked that too.

884
00:39:31,601 --> 00:39:34,720
I mean I used to let a lot of them go.
I get that,

885
00:39:34,721 --> 00:39:37,990
but I'm a little.
I'm a little tormented on that.

886
00:39:38,080 --> 00:39:41,290
You're putting a fucking hook through
someone's head and you're going to let

887
00:39:41,291 --> 00:39:43,780
it go.
Like how about just not doing that?

888
00:39:43,810 --> 00:39:46,760
If you really love the fish,
how about just fish with no hook at all

889
00:39:46,761 --> 00:39:48,310
when they bite it,
you know,

890
00:39:48,910 --> 00:39:50,320
you know,
you would have had them.

891
00:39:50,440 --> 00:39:51,760
That's probably fair.
Yeah.

892
00:39:51,761 --> 00:39:54,180
It's probably the way to go.
It's weird that we would be.

893
00:39:54,220 --> 00:39:57,280
It's this weird thing that we have in
our head.

894
00:39:57,560 --> 00:40:02,440
We were trying to activate those reward
systems that were there in place in

895
00:40:02,441 --> 00:40:05,230
order to keep ourselves fed.
Right?

896
00:40:05,231 --> 00:40:08,830
Like if there's a thing that happens
when you catch a fish you've seen like

897
00:40:08,831 --> 00:40:12,170
I've seen with my little kids have taken
my,

898
00:40:12,230 --> 00:40:15,520
my daughters fishing and when they catch
a fish they have this look in their face

899
00:40:15,521 --> 00:40:16,320
like,
oh,

900
00:40:16,320 --> 00:40:17,290
I got it,
I got it.

901
00:40:17,291 --> 00:40:18,124
I got it.
Oh,

902
00:40:18,680 --> 00:40:21,670
like this is a super exciting.
When they pull it out of the boat and

903
00:40:21,671 --> 00:40:23,890
then the fact that they're going to get
to eat it later.

904
00:40:23,891 --> 00:40:28,891
There's some weird primal DNA thing that
gets activated when you catch something

905
00:40:29,470 --> 00:40:32,980
and I think that's what these fly
fishermen that are letting the fish go

906
00:40:32,981 --> 00:40:33,910
or trying to do that.

907
00:40:33,910 --> 00:40:35,920
Just little junkies for that.
That,

908
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:37,300
that feeling,
that feeling,

909
00:40:37,301 --> 00:40:42,301
that DNA activation,
that reward system thing and obviously

910
00:40:42,521 --> 00:40:45,700
it's difficult and obviously there's a
lot of tremendous amount of skill and

911
00:40:45,701 --> 00:40:49,350
finesse involved and fly casting role
casting,

912
00:40:49,570 --> 00:40:54,570
trying to place this fly right in this
little pool and dragon with the current

913
00:40:54,821 --> 00:40:57,310
and get that nasty trout to bite onto
it.

914
00:40:57,760 --> 00:41:01,930
But you also want to own it.
You want to have him and let him go.

915
00:41:02,290 --> 00:41:04,240
Like you don't want to like say I
could've had you,

916
00:41:04,241 --> 00:41:06,020
but there's no hook on dark side of
fluff.

917
00:41:06,810 --> 00:41:09,250
You want to know you got it.
You don't want to know he bit.

918
00:41:09,370 --> 00:41:12,850
You want to know you got it.
So no one goes fly fishing with no hook.

919
00:41:13,330 --> 00:41:17,110
They go with a barbless hook and they'll
catch it and then they'll let it go and

920
00:41:17,120 --> 00:41:17,861
that's,
that's fine.

921
00:41:17,861 --> 00:41:19,540
As a barbless hook like,
okay.

922
00:41:19,840 --> 00:41:22,000
How about I put a Barbara so through
your fucking face.

923
00:41:23,590 --> 00:41:25,090
Good.
That's not good.

924
00:41:25,120 --> 00:41:27,850
You're trying to ruin fishermen.
Are fishing for all catch and release

925
00:41:27,851 --> 00:41:29,670
fishermen?
I am not in.

926
00:41:29,780 --> 00:41:31,720
I,
I supported 100 percent and I've done

927
00:41:31,721 --> 00:41:33,100
it.
I'm a hypocrite.

928
00:41:33,170 --> 00:41:35,300
That regard.
I have done some catch and release,

929
00:41:35,600 --> 00:41:40,600
but I feel like there is a weirdness to
it that it's this why you're not eating

930
00:41:43,671 --> 00:41:44,504
it.
Like why?

931
00:41:44,510 --> 00:41:46,250
Like how about you can't just look at
them.

932
00:41:46,430 --> 00:41:47,930
No,
you got to catch him,

933
00:41:48,650 --> 00:41:52,030
catch him in and then let them go.
But how,

934
00:41:52,050 --> 00:41:54,130
how are you going to look at them if you
don't care?

935
00:41:54,140 --> 00:41:55,700
I'll get him in the water.
Here's the thing.

936
00:41:56,300 --> 00:41:58,760
A good percentage,
I don't know what the number is,

937
00:41:58,850 --> 00:42:01,550
especially when you're like salmon
fishing and you're using like heavy

938
00:42:01,551 --> 00:42:03,110
tackle,
a good percentage of your catch and

939
00:42:03,111 --> 00:42:04,300
release and have those fish are never
gonna.

940
00:42:04,320 --> 00:42:09,320
Make it catch them with a big lure.
Barb hooks get them deep in the throat.

941
00:42:09,770 --> 00:42:11,750
He pulled them out.
Their gills are bleeding.

942
00:42:12,590 --> 00:42:14,190
I mean that's,
that's,

943
00:42:14,480 --> 00:42:16,600
that's a scenario that you don't like.
Yeah,

944
00:42:16,700 --> 00:42:20,000
catch in that essence.
Most fishermen I think would know that

945
00:42:20,001 --> 00:42:22,550
you can't turn that fish back loose,
but you have to.

946
00:42:22,551 --> 00:42:25,760
Sometimes you have to,
but you have to turn them loose because

947
00:42:25,761 --> 00:42:29,000
it's the law as the regulations and you
turn it loose and you watch it swim away

948
00:42:29,060 --> 00:42:32,030
and look because going about a 40
percent chance.

949
00:42:32,060 --> 00:42:33,080
Yeah.
Yeah.

950
00:42:33,290 --> 00:42:34,460
No,
and everybody hates that.

951
00:42:34,550 --> 00:42:35,650
Yeah,
that worst,

952
00:42:36,170 --> 00:42:37,820
but,
but they still want that feeling.

953
00:42:38,090 --> 00:42:39,890
I,
that's a weird to catching the fish

954
00:42:39,891 --> 00:42:40,611
things.
A weird feeling.

955
00:42:40,611 --> 00:42:43,190
Apparently it's that way with a
butterfly.

956
00:42:43,191 --> 00:42:46,430
Catchers too,
because human beings used to be

957
00:42:46,431 --> 00:42:47,930
insectivores.
Really?

958
00:42:48,200 --> 00:42:50,600
Yeah.
I was listening to this lecture wants by

959
00:42:50,601 --> 00:42:52,520
Terence Mckenna and he was talking about
that.

960
00:42:53,420 --> 00:42:57,410
Terence Mckenna,
great psychedelic author and lecturer.

961
00:42:57,690 --> 00:43:02,570
He was talking about how he was really
into butterfly catching at one point in

962
00:43:02,571 --> 00:43:07,571
time and the odd thing is that it
activates this very primal reward system

963
00:43:08,361 --> 00:43:11,390
in your body the same way catching a
fish would that.

964
00:43:11,400 --> 00:43:13,880
It's because human beings used to be
insectivores.

965
00:43:13,881 --> 00:43:17,960
We used to eat a lot of insects,
so when you do find some rare butterfly

966
00:43:17,961 --> 00:43:20,960
that you've been after for months and
months and you have the opportunity to

967
00:43:20,961 --> 00:43:25,250
drop the net on that mother fucker
get too excited about them.

968
00:43:25,670 --> 00:43:28,250
That's a weird sort of trophy hunting
butterfly hunting too,

969
00:43:28,700 --> 00:43:31,460
because you're allowed to do that.
You can take that little fucker,

970
00:43:31,461 --> 00:43:34,520
dry them out and put them on a wall
somewhere and nobody thinks you're a

971
00:43:34,521 --> 00:43:38,270
barbarian.
Like people are real racist when it

972
00:43:38,271 --> 00:43:40,190
comes to what animals are allowed to be
dead.

973
00:43:41,300 --> 00:43:42,133
You know what I mean?

974
00:43:42,240 --> 00:43:45,190
Yeah.
Pigs and cows are screwed.

975
00:43:45,230 --> 00:43:46,880
Yeah.
Yeah.

976
00:43:46,881 --> 00:43:48,690
Pigs and cows.
The Bulls.

977
00:43:48,770 --> 00:43:50,570
I mean,
but more so bugs,

978
00:43:50,630 --> 00:43:51,463
you know?
Yeah.

979
00:43:51,670 --> 00:43:52,940
Oh yeah.
Nobody likes blogs.

980
00:43:54,270 --> 00:43:57,980
I went to an ashram once and this lady
who was running the Armstrong had a.

981
00:43:57,981 --> 00:44:02,981
can of raid and she was talking to me
about the ant problem that they have and

982
00:44:03,651 --> 00:44:04,490
I was like,
hold up,

983
00:44:05,100 --> 00:44:08,720
so you spray,
you spray these ants with poison?

984
00:44:09,140 --> 00:44:10,010
And she's like,
yeah,

985
00:44:10,040 --> 00:44:11,630
and I go see,
kill the ants.

986
00:44:11,990 --> 00:44:13,520
I go,
isn't that contrary to what you're

987
00:44:13,521 --> 00:44:14,930
teaching?
She's like,

988
00:44:14,931 --> 00:44:17,650
sometimes there's just things you have
to do because otherwise the ants will

989
00:44:17,660 --> 00:44:20,980
get in our food and
like,

990
00:44:20,990 --> 00:44:23,150
Huh,
this is odd.

991
00:44:23,610 --> 00:44:25,700
A urine,
an odd crossroads here,

992
00:44:25,701 --> 00:44:27,920
lady.
You're a Buddhist,

993
00:44:27,980 --> 00:44:32,160
living in an ashram with a can of poison
that you use for living beings that you

994
00:44:32,161 --> 00:44:33,330
don't like being around you.

995
00:44:36,390 --> 00:44:37,420
I have nothing.
I don't know,

996
00:44:38,330 --> 00:44:41,010
but if she was like,
if she had like cats that she was

997
00:44:41,011 --> 00:44:43,140
killing with a baseball bat,
everybody would be mad.

998
00:44:43,300 --> 00:44:44,400
She'd be in jail.
Yeah.

999
00:44:44,940 --> 00:44:45,630
Weird,
right?

1000
00:44:45,630 --> 00:44:46,830
Yeah.
With weird rules.

1001
00:44:47,700 --> 00:44:50,910
Sorry to take you down this world.
This is very interesting to me.

1002
00:44:51,540 --> 00:44:53,460
I didn't know that human beings used to
be insectivores,

1003
00:44:53,490 --> 00:44:55,800
so yeah.
Apparently something new everyday.

1004
00:44:55,830 --> 00:44:57,570
Well,
that's one of the things that they talk

1005
00:44:57,571 --> 00:45:02,571
about in terms of the future of protein,
that insects provide very complex,

1006
00:45:03,661 --> 00:45:08,370
complete proteins and they can provide
it to large amounts of people fairly

1007
00:45:08,371 --> 00:45:09,930
inexpensively.
And so,

1008
00:45:09,931 --> 00:45:11,210
um,
cricket proteins,

1009
00:45:11,220 --> 00:45:14,760
very popular tail if you know this,
know a lot of people eat cricket

1010
00:45:14,761 --> 00:45:16,060
protein.
Yeah.

1011
00:45:16,110 --> 00:45:18,810
They have cricket bars and shit.
Cricket bars.

1012
00:45:18,811 --> 00:45:21,900
Yeah.
They make bars at a crickets and cricket

1013
00:45:21,901 --> 00:45:24,660
protein bars and apparently they taste
pretty good.

1014
00:45:24,910 --> 00:45:25,320
Well,
you know,

1015
00:45:25,320 --> 00:45:26,330
my daughter ate,
uh,

1016
00:45:26,380 --> 00:45:28,470
you know,
we bought like on vacation somewhere,

1017
00:45:28,471 --> 00:45:32,190
like there's novelty sack of like
barbecue crickets or something because

1018
00:45:32,191 --> 00:45:33,510
kids wanted to try him.
Of course.

1019
00:45:33,511 --> 00:45:35,460
My mom was like,
after he actually got it out of the

1020
00:45:35,670 --> 00:45:36,240
package,
he was like,

1021
00:45:36,240 --> 00:45:37,080
ah,
I don't know about that.

1022
00:45:37,081 --> 00:45:38,010
But I was like,
I'll try it.

1023
00:45:38,750 --> 00:45:41,310
And she ate it and then she was like,
it's pretty good.

1024
00:45:41,760 --> 00:45:44,310
They're not bad.
What is it as a cricket milkshake?

1025
00:45:44,380 --> 00:45:45,220
Hey.

1026
00:45:47,400 --> 00:45:48,090
Yeah.
Is that,

1027
00:45:48,090 --> 00:45:50,520
is that pre made?
There's the cricket bars from the

1028
00:45:50,570 --> 00:45:52,290
powder.
I think it would look more palatable if

1029
00:45:52,291 --> 00:45:54,820
they didn't have a picture of a cricket,
like crawling out of it.

1030
00:45:55,260 --> 00:45:57,270
Hide that shit.
So there's the.

1031
00:45:57,271 --> 00:45:59,500
There's the cricket protein powder.
That's crap.

1032
00:45:59,550 --> 00:46:02,820
They cooked the cricket grind,
those little fuckers up and turn it into

1033
00:46:02,821 --> 00:46:07,110
protein powder and it's apparently has a
complete amino acid profile.

1034
00:46:07,170 --> 00:46:10,290
It's easy to digest and it doesn't make
people feel bad.

1035
00:46:10,291 --> 00:46:10,980
Like,
look at that.

1036
00:46:10,980 --> 00:46:15,980
Look at the grams of protein per 100
gallons of water.

1037
00:46:16,441 --> 00:46:20,720
How much you can get for a cow.
You only get six grams of protein per

1038
00:46:20,730 --> 00:46:23,250
100 grams of water or 100 gallons of
water,

1039
00:46:23,251 --> 00:46:27,600
but for crickets you get 71 grams of
protein for the same amount of water.

1040
00:46:27,850 --> 00:46:30,030
Wow.
So it's more than 10 times the amount of

1041
00:46:30,031 --> 00:46:31,830
protein.
So you could.

1042
00:46:32,190 --> 00:46:35,310
And I don't think it has near the impact
on the environment.

1043
00:46:35,810 --> 00:46:39,450
I'm in terms of like raising them.
They don't have a lot of the waste

1044
00:46:39,451 --> 00:46:42,990
products and the issues that cows have.
Methane

1045
00:46:44,820 --> 00:46:46,580
smells.
This is a.

1046
00:46:46,590 --> 00:46:48,210
This was amazing.
Sorry Dude.

1047
00:46:49,050 --> 00:46:49,883
It's all good.
I,

1048
00:46:50,370 --> 00:46:51,900
I'm sitting here thinking about eating
crickets.

1049
00:46:52,160 --> 00:46:54,510
I'm thinking about switching.
I've had crickets before,

1050
00:46:54,511 --> 00:46:57,660
man.
I was in Mexico and they cooked them and

1051
00:46:57,661 --> 00:46:59,740
left him in the room,
like in the.

1052
00:46:59,880 --> 00:47:01,640
We stayed at a hotel and there's a
little snack,

1053
00:47:01,770 --> 00:47:03,720
like a little snack thing.
It was a little.

1054
00:47:04,090 --> 00:47:09,090
They were like a almost like a soy sauce
based or some sort of assault based

1055
00:47:10,320 --> 00:47:11,270
chips or something.
Yeah,

1056
00:47:11,280 --> 00:47:14,580
and they were,
they were fried and you just crunch them

1057
00:47:14,640 --> 00:47:15,630
and I was like,
okay,

1058
00:47:15,750 --> 00:47:18,360
these are actually pretty good.
I like this.

1059
00:47:18,470 --> 00:47:22,410
They're essentially related,
but a lot of bugs are related to

1060
00:47:22,411 --> 00:47:23,244
shellfish.

1061
00:47:24,060 --> 00:47:27,450
Whereas like we found on fear factor
that if you're allergic to shrimp,

1062
00:47:27,630 --> 00:47:30,490
you're also allergic to roaches.
Really?

1063
00:47:30,520 --> 00:47:32,440
Yeah.
We found that out because we made a duty

1064
00:47:32,441 --> 00:47:35,530
roaches and he is.
When he started having an allergic

1065
00:47:35,830 --> 00:47:38,740
reaction,
we had to get them a shot of adrenaline

1066
00:47:38,741 --> 00:47:40,840
and taken to the hospital.
That's awful.

1067
00:47:40,900 --> 00:47:42,100
Yeah,
it was a bad day.

1068
00:47:42,640 --> 00:47:42,971
Yeah.
He,

1069
00:47:42,971 --> 00:47:45,190
you know,
I guess your throat closes up on you and

1070
00:47:45,191 --> 00:47:46,024
you start,
you know,

1071
00:47:46,060 --> 00:47:48,140
a lot of inflammation.
You start wheeze and yeah,

1072
00:47:48,170 --> 00:47:49,300
it was not fun.
Yeah.

1073
00:47:49,510 --> 00:47:54,070
But crickets.
Good and high in protein you ever,

1074
00:47:54,180 --> 00:47:56,830
you never eat anything weird to you?
Like a straight laced eater?

1075
00:47:56,860 --> 00:47:57,670
I'm pretty,
yeah,

1076
00:47:57,670 --> 00:48:00,650
I'm pretty straight wild game.
Uh,

1077
00:48:00,730 --> 00:48:03,610
my dad was a bird hunter and a rabbit
hunter growing up,

1078
00:48:03,670 --> 00:48:05,890
but I've never,
I've never loved it.

1079
00:48:06,160 --> 00:48:06,993
No,
no.

1080
00:48:07,390 --> 00:48:08,860
It's all about how it's cooked really,
right?

1081
00:48:09,070 --> 00:48:10,840
Yeah.
And I don't know if we ever got that

1082
00:48:10,841 --> 00:48:12,580
down in my house.
So yeah,

1083
00:48:12,581 --> 00:48:13,780
it's,
it's tricky.

1084
00:48:13,781 --> 00:48:17,170
Like I think if you're around a real
wild game chef,

1085
00:48:17,171 --> 00:48:20,380
like there's a guy named Hank Shaw who's
been on this podcast before who is a

1086
00:48:20,410 --> 00:48:24,040
hunter who is also like a real
extraordinary chef and he makes these

1087
00:48:24,041 --> 00:48:27,520
amazing dishes with wild game and he's
one of those guys is like,

1088
00:48:27,521 --> 00:48:29,770
you know,
you think it's bad because you haven't

1089
00:48:29,771 --> 00:48:30,604
cooked it.
Right.

1090
00:48:30,820 --> 00:48:31,480
Let me cook it.
Yeah,

1091
00:48:31,480 --> 00:48:35,610
I think there's a lost art to some of it
or a lesser known art maybe.

1092
00:48:36,460 --> 00:48:37,600
Where are you living right now?
Man?

1093
00:48:37,690 --> 00:48:39,670
I live south of Nashville,
Tennessee.

1094
00:48:39,850 --> 00:48:44,110
So when you flew into hell today and you
see like literally it's on fire for

1095
00:48:44,111 --> 00:48:47,530
people listening at this point in time.
This is one of the worst fires in the

1096
00:48:47,531 --> 00:48:48,670
history of Los Angeles.

1097
00:48:48,700 --> 00:48:49,720
Pretty scary.
Yeah,

1098
00:48:49,810 --> 00:48:51,850
because it's what's called a dry
hurricane.

1099
00:48:52,090 --> 00:48:54,490
Meaning there,
there's hurricane force winds,

1100
00:48:54,491 --> 00:48:57,430
but there's no rain and the fires are
going fucking crazy.

1101
00:48:57,460 --> 00:49:00,910
Fifty thousand acres down in a day is
nothing right now.

1102
00:49:01,360 --> 00:49:05,020
It's a while.
We've been here a few days and we were,

1103
00:49:05,460 --> 00:49:07,100
uh,
we got in two,

1104
00:49:07,140 --> 00:49:09,340
three days ago and we've been doing some
other things,

1105
00:49:09,550 --> 00:49:13,300
tv things and whatever.
But looking up that on the news is not

1106
00:49:13,301 --> 00:49:14,770
a,
not a fun thing to watch.

1107
00:49:14,771 --> 00:49:17,200
And I'm,
I'm so heartbroken for everybody losing

1108
00:49:17,201 --> 00:49:18,680
their homes.
And uh,

1109
00:49:19,220 --> 00:49:20,053
it's,
it's,

1110
00:49:20,290 --> 00:49:23,230
it's pretty tragic.
Awful thing to have to watch.

1111
00:49:23,410 --> 00:49:24,610
Yeah,
it certainly is.

1112
00:49:24,860 --> 00:49:27,530
It's the side effect of living in a
place that doesn't have any weather.

1113
00:49:28,030 --> 00:49:29,350
No,
there you go.

1114
00:49:29,440 --> 00:49:32,170
Everything dries out.
It's so rarely rains here.

1115
00:49:32,610 --> 00:49:33,120
You know,
it's.

1116
00:49:33,120 --> 00:49:36,940
And when you get like these crazy winds,
the Santa Ana winds that happened every

1117
00:49:36,940 --> 00:49:37,600
year.
It's just,

1118
00:49:37,600 --> 00:49:38,530
this is extraordinary.

1119
00:49:38,530 --> 00:49:41,640
The winds here and just perfect time for
fires obviously.

1120
00:49:41,650 --> 00:49:43,230
So if somebody kicking these things up
or what's,

1121
00:49:43,231 --> 00:49:45,980
what's the deal?
Really no one knows when that could be.

1122
00:49:46,040 --> 00:49:49,480
Arson could be.
Feels like that could be.

1123
00:49:49,570 --> 00:49:51,210
Look,
there's some sick fucks out there.

1124
00:49:51,240 --> 00:49:54,190
They know that the wind is a bad thing
for fire and then all of a sudden the

1125
00:49:54,191 --> 00:49:57,670
fire shows up.
It's entirely possible that have 20

1126
00:49:57,670 --> 00:49:58,990
million people.
There's one or two people that are

1127
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:01,810
either fucking mind.
Yeah.

1128
00:50:01,830 --> 00:50:03,670
That's way out there.
Is that what you were thinking?

1129
00:50:03,700 --> 00:50:04,740
I don't know.
I just watched it.

1130
00:50:04,741 --> 00:50:08,890
I'm just like.
I mean the fire spontaneously start,

1131
00:50:08,910 --> 00:50:10,710
you know that.
Yeah.

1132
00:50:10,870 --> 00:50:11,860
And these.
Yeah.

1133
00:50:11,861 --> 00:50:12,850
I don't know.
It just seems.

1134
00:50:12,880 --> 00:50:14,050
Well,
you're probably right.

1135
00:50:14,051 --> 00:50:16,400
I mean that's one of the suspicions is
that it's arson,

1136
00:50:16,401 --> 00:50:20,820
unrelated or this several fires,
one of them and there's so many you

1137
00:50:20,821 --> 00:50:21,580
don't want at this point.

1138
00:50:21,580 --> 00:50:25,680
I'm just like somebody running around,
like thinking I don't know what the

1139
00:50:26,090 --> 00:50:28,970
monitor they happen simultaneously.
Yeah.

1140
00:50:29,150 --> 00:50:32,750
All during the same crazy conditions and
they happen like way far apart from each

1141
00:50:32,751 --> 00:50:35,060
other.
So you talked to firefighters about it

1142
00:50:35,061 --> 00:50:36,710
and they're like,
there's a lot of times we don't know,

1143
00:50:36,711 --> 00:50:38,930
but there's a lot of times there's some
serious suspicions.

1144
00:50:38,931 --> 00:50:39,770
Yeah.
You know,

1145
00:50:39,830 --> 00:50:41,950
it's just,
it's unfortunately,

1146
00:50:41,960 --> 00:50:44,510
you'd have to think about that.
I mean think about all these human

1147
00:50:44,511 --> 00:50:47,660
beings and there's one or two or
however,

1148
00:50:47,661 --> 00:50:51,190
whatever the number is there,
so tortured and so in,

1149
00:50:51,191 --> 00:50:54,950
in pain and so fucked up there.
Their wires crossed.

1150
00:50:55,050 --> 00:50:55,883
Yeah.
I don't get it.

1151
00:50:56,610 --> 00:50:59,190
I don't get it and I hope that's not the
case,

1152
00:50:59,230 --> 00:51:02,250
but I,
but I'll watch all these guys on the

1153
00:51:02,251 --> 00:51:03,084
news,
you know,

1154
00:51:03,530 --> 00:51:07,230
up on the roofs trying to save their
property or a firefighter's putting

1155
00:51:07,231 --> 00:51:09,450
themselves in harm's way or guys flying
helicopters,

1156
00:51:09,650 --> 00:51:13,550
Dublin water in zero visibility
conditions in is just like,

1157
00:51:13,560 --> 00:51:14,393
man,
it's just,

1158
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:16,890
it's awful.
It is awful.

1159
00:51:17,110 --> 00:51:19,360
You know,
it's the round this time of year.

1160
00:51:19,361 --> 00:51:22,150
You really appreciate firefighters.
Absolutely.

1161
00:51:22,270 --> 00:51:24,640
Yeah.
And I think a lot of people take them

1162
00:51:24,670 --> 00:51:27,190
for granted most of the time until you
need them.

1163
00:51:27,550 --> 00:51:29,530
They're like,
there are superheroes that only get

1164
00:51:29,531 --> 00:51:31,290
credit when they do some shit.
Right.

1165
00:51:31,610 --> 00:51:33,250
You know,
and when they do do some shit,

1166
00:51:33,251 --> 00:51:35,320
you realize like,
oh well without them,

1167
00:51:35,740 --> 00:51:39,580
like I talked to a firefighter wants,
it freaked me the fuck he was saying.

1168
00:51:39,640 --> 00:51:43,270
It's just a matter of time until one day
with the right winds,

1169
00:51:43,390 --> 00:51:45,550
there's a fire that burns all the way to
the ocean,

1170
00:51:45,580 --> 00:51:48,370
just goes right through La and there's
nothing we can do about it.

1171
00:51:48,910 --> 00:51:49,810
And I was like,
what?

1172
00:51:50,260 --> 00:51:51,970
And he's like,
it's a matter of time.

1173
00:51:51,971 --> 00:51:53,190
He goes,
everybody thinks it.

1174
00:51:53,500 --> 00:51:57,250
It's just a matter of catching the right
fire and then you realize today like,

1175
00:51:57,280 --> 00:51:58,210
oh,
he's right.

1176
00:51:58,630 --> 00:51:59,463
Like,
oh yeah,

1177
00:51:59,470 --> 00:52:02,500
Bel airs on fire where all the rich
people that's on fire.

1178
00:52:03,050 --> 00:52:03,631
Yeah,
no,

1179
00:52:03,631 --> 00:52:04,990
it's a,
like I said,

1180
00:52:05,060 --> 00:52:09,990
it's like live on the news.
We were watching it in the hotel room,

1181
00:52:09,991 --> 00:52:10,824
you know,
it's just

1182
00:52:12,360 --> 00:52:13,770
pretty hardcore.
Yeah,

1183
00:52:13,990 --> 00:52:16,950
I mean we changed our route to get over
here today just to get it because

1184
00:52:16,951 --> 00:52:20,100
there's road closures and reflect that.
Did it take you more time?

1185
00:52:20,640 --> 00:52:23,520
I think we gave ourselves like an hour
and hour and 20 minutes.

1186
00:52:23,530 --> 00:52:26,610
Hour and a half to get up the day.
So what else you got going on right now?

1187
00:52:27,060 --> 00:52:28,290
Uh,
um,

1188
00:52:28,880 --> 00:52:33,090
was we did a few TV things and we're
kind of winding down for the year and

1189
00:52:33,091 --> 00:52:34,840
then we'll kick back up in,
uh,

1190
00:52:34,860 --> 00:52:37,380
January to get the grammys and January I
guess,

1191
00:52:37,470 --> 00:52:40,470
um,
and then kind of slowly get back into

1192
00:52:40,471 --> 00:52:42,870
it,
but my wife's pregnant with twins so

1193
00:52:42,871 --> 00:52:44,930
we're trying to graduation.
Thank you.

1194
00:52:45,010 --> 00:52:46,220
Uh,
you know,

1195
00:52:46,860 --> 00:52:49,080
have,
and she toured with instincts with me

1196
00:52:49,140 --> 00:52:53,100
pretty much all the time and so we're
trying to figure out the new reality of

1197
00:52:53,101 --> 00:52:53,370
that.

1198
00:52:53,370 --> 00:52:55,260
You know,
we have two kids out with us,

1199
00:52:55,261 --> 00:52:58,800
but now we're going to four.
So it's how old are your kids?

1200
00:52:59,280 --> 00:53:01,770
They're eight and seven.
So do you bring a tutor on the road with

1201
00:53:01,771 --> 00:53:02,604
you?
How do you do that?

1202
00:53:02,670 --> 00:53:05,450
My mother in law is a retired second
grade school teachers.

1203
00:53:05,510 --> 00:53:06,630
Convenient.
Yeah.

1204
00:53:06,631 --> 00:53:09,270
So,
so we homeschool our children on the

1205
00:53:09,271 --> 00:53:10,380
road and they,
but they get,

1206
00:53:10,770 --> 00:53:13,980
when they studied the Boston tea party,
they get to go look at all the stuff in

1207
00:53:13,981 --> 00:53:14,814
Boston,
you know,

1208
00:53:15,750 --> 00:53:16,491
it's a,
it's a,

1209
00:53:16,491 --> 00:53:21,491
it's a different kind of education.
But are there things like that kind of

1210
00:53:21,661 --> 00:53:24,660
live and breathe for them a little bit
more than than what I got grown up and

1211
00:53:24,661 --> 00:53:26,520
hopefully someday they'll appreciate
that.

1212
00:53:26,730 --> 00:53:27,690
Oh,
I'm sure they will.

1213
00:53:27,960 --> 00:53:30,930
I mean it's got to be interesting to
them to,

1214
00:53:30,960 --> 00:53:35,960
to see their dad go from being a singer
songwriter to all of a sudden being a

1215
00:53:36,691 --> 00:53:38,970
celebrity center of.

1216
00:53:38,990 --> 00:53:40,900
They realized that,
I don't know,

1217
00:53:40,910 --> 00:53:43,910
I think to them they're,
they're young enough and you know,

1218
00:53:44,640 --> 00:53:46,290
that just seems like,
oh,

1219
00:53:46,291 --> 00:53:47,820
that yeah.
Mom and dad have to go sing a show.

1220
00:53:47,821 --> 00:53:52,360
You know what they did?
What are your mom and dad going to go

1221
00:53:52,450 --> 00:53:55,020
sit in?
My mom makes houses.

1222
00:53:55,890 --> 00:54:00,660
She doesn't say yeah they don't,
they don't have real uh,

1223
00:54:02,110 --> 00:54:02,943
what's,
what's the,

1224
00:54:03,110 --> 00:54:07,280
they don't have anything else to compare
it to reference point of reference was

1225
00:54:07,290 --> 00:54:09,120
looking for.
So it's just Kinda,

1226
00:54:09,690 --> 00:54:12,150
that's just kinda what life is to them.
When you tour,

1227
00:54:12,360 --> 00:54:14,760
how long do you go?
Like how much of a stretch?

1228
00:54:14,850 --> 00:54:16,530
Well,
we very rarely try to.

1229
00:54:16,610 --> 00:54:18,150
I mean,
we've tried to be wicked warriors as

1230
00:54:18,151 --> 00:54:19,560
much as we can and do,
you know,

1231
00:54:19,800 --> 00:54:20,371
Thursday,
Friday,

1232
00:54:20,371 --> 00:54:21,590
Saturday.
Ron's.

1233
00:54:21,600 --> 00:54:22,130
But,
you know,

1234
00:54:22,130 --> 00:54:24,540
some things logistically that doesn't
make any sense if you're gonna run

1235
00:54:24,541 --> 00:54:27,720
across Canada or we're,
we're based in Nashville.

1236
00:54:27,720 --> 00:54:30,690
So if we want to run the west coast,
we're out here for a couple of weeks or

1237
00:54:30,691 --> 00:54:32,910
something like that,
but never longer than that,

1238
00:54:32,940 --> 00:54:34,080
you know,
we never trust it out.

1239
00:54:34,200 --> 00:54:37,920
We're not very rock and roll about it
and we don't live out there and don't

1240
00:54:37,921 --> 00:54:38,581
want to,
you know.

1241
00:54:38,581 --> 00:54:40,830
So um,
I love to play shows.

1242
00:54:40,831 --> 00:54:44,100
There's a limit on how many I could sing
and in a week it's three's the limit.

1243
00:54:44,220 --> 00:54:48,120
So we stick with that and try to make
that a habit,

1244
00:54:48,121 --> 00:54:50,740
has as much kind of home time.
And uh,

1245
00:54:50,920 --> 00:54:53,010
so all the guys in the band,
the crew and you know,

1246
00:54:53,011 --> 00:54:56,400
everybody's got kids and families and
things and it's a hard,

1247
00:54:56,460 --> 00:55:00,030
it's a hard way to make a living if
you're always gone.

1248
00:55:00,060 --> 00:55:00,660
Like,
yeah,

1249
00:55:00,660 --> 00:55:02,180
like months and months and months gone.
What's,

1250
00:55:02,190 --> 00:55:03,150
that's a lot.
That's,

1251
00:55:03,810 --> 00:55:05,910
that's the rock and roll way of doing
things a lot.

1252
00:55:06,240 --> 00:55:08,070
Yeah,
I know sturgill how to do that.

1253
00:55:08,330 --> 00:55:10,170
Like that for awhile.
He didn't have to.

1254
00:55:10,171 --> 00:55:11,340
He chose to.
Chose to.

1255
00:55:11,530 --> 00:55:13,330
Yeah,
I convinced I had to convince him to

1256
00:55:13,340 --> 00:55:15,150
that,
but he had to convince him of that,

1257
00:55:15,151 --> 00:55:16,350
that he didn't have to.
Yeah.

1258
00:55:17,160 --> 00:55:18,060
I don't know.
He only,

1259
00:55:18,061 --> 00:55:20,390
he convinces himself if anything,
I'm not gonna say that I know what

1260
00:55:20,470 --> 00:55:22,170
you're saying,
but you've influenced him.

1261
00:55:22,430 --> 00:55:24,090
I'm not,
I'm not even going to say I influenced

1262
00:55:24,091 --> 00:55:27,360
it,
but I would tell suggested I would tell

1263
00:55:27,361 --> 00:55:27,901
him,
hey man,

1264
00:55:27,901 --> 00:55:29,240
you don't have to.
Why are you doing this?

1265
00:55:29,970 --> 00:55:33,930
So he felt like what?
I think all his years of work in regular

1266
00:55:33,931 --> 00:55:34,770
jobs,
you know,

1267
00:55:34,771 --> 00:55:38,700
working on the railroad and do all the
shit that he had to do when success

1268
00:55:38,701 --> 00:55:39,481
came,
he was like,

1269
00:55:39,481 --> 00:55:42,370
Jesus Christ,
I've got to keep this fire going well

1270
00:55:42,380 --> 00:55:44,810
and get the kindle a kindle and you
know,

1271
00:55:45,930 --> 00:55:47,630
absolutely you had this moment,
you know,

1272
00:55:47,800 --> 00:55:49,860
when you have a little something going
on with your life.

1273
00:55:49,890 --> 00:55:50,723
Well I got to,
you know,

1274
00:55:50,760 --> 00:55:53,990
make hay while the sun shines on and
understand that wholeheartedly.

1275
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:54,630
But,
you know,

1276
00:55:54,630 --> 00:55:56,520
we're all human beings and we all have
limits.

1277
00:55:57,150 --> 00:55:58,740
Yeah.
Do you have a limit of the amount of

1278
00:55:58,741 --> 00:56:00,630
days that you could sing in a week?
Yeah.

1279
00:56:00,631 --> 00:56:01,650
Three.
That's it.

1280
00:56:01,710 --> 00:56:03,780
That's it.
And then your voice starts to get

1281
00:56:03,781 --> 00:56:04,800
strained.
Yeah.

1282
00:56:04,801 --> 00:56:05,431
That's,
I mean,

1283
00:56:05,431 --> 00:56:07,050
that's,
I think pretty hard too,

1284
00:56:07,051 --> 00:56:07,770
you know?
So,

1285
00:56:07,770 --> 00:56:09,930
um,
yeah,

1286
00:56:09,931 --> 00:56:10,381
that's,
that's,

1287
00:56:10,381 --> 00:56:12,420
that's the end.
You know,

1288
00:56:12,430 --> 00:56:14,820
and I,
and I have conversations with other

1289
00:56:14,821 --> 00:56:17,250
singers when I run into it was like,
how many shows can you play in a week?

1290
00:56:17,520 --> 00:56:19,210
And you know,
some guys it's too.

1291
00:56:19,211 --> 00:56:21,430
And some day,
some guys it's like I can play everyday

1292
00:56:21,450 --> 00:56:22,470
of the week.
Wow.

1293
00:56:22,620 --> 00:56:25,030
And that,
but that's not me through free shows,

1294
00:56:25,031 --> 00:56:26,650
just kind of,
do you ever have a greedy,

1295
00:56:26,651 --> 00:56:28,390
make moneybags agent?
It's like,

1296
00:56:28,391 --> 00:56:32,440
listen Chris four shows a week,
25 percent more money.

1297
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:36,610
Well
just one more show.

1298
00:56:36,790 --> 00:56:38,530
I wouldn't call anybody out work with
greedy,

1299
00:56:38,540 --> 00:56:42,310
make moneybags and Christopher two shows
a night out,

1300
00:56:42,311 --> 00:56:45,670
a big deal.
But certainly certainly,

1301
00:56:45,671 --> 00:56:47,320
you know,
certainly everybody,

1302
00:56:47,321 --> 00:56:49,890
you know,
everybody wants a,

1303
00:56:49,900 --> 00:56:50,980
you know,
as you work with.

1304
00:56:50,981 --> 00:56:54,160
And that's their job is to try to
maximize what you're able to do

1305
00:56:54,870 --> 00:56:56,020
momentarily.
And,

1306
00:56:56,021 --> 00:56:59,570
and you know,
sometimes you have to look at me,

1307
00:56:59,571 --> 00:57:02,030
go,
sorry I can't do this physically.

1308
00:57:02,080 --> 00:57:03,550
Not yet.
Not physically possible.

1309
00:57:04,030 --> 00:57:07,570
And then they have to deal within those
parameters and we figured out how to

1310
00:57:07,600 --> 00:57:10,300
maximize that.
Does every country music singer have to

1311
00:57:10,301 --> 00:57:12,220
live around Nashville?
Is that like requisite?

1312
00:57:12,940 --> 00:57:14,140
Um,
I don't,

1313
00:57:14,540 --> 00:57:19,540
it seems like it's a giant collection of
you fuckers is one spot that is the kind

1314
00:57:20,171 --> 00:57:25,171
of the hub for a actress living in La or
New York,

1315
00:57:25,331 --> 00:57:26,040
whatever,
whatever,

1316
00:57:26,040 --> 00:57:27,550
wherever the.
I think it's La,

1317
00:57:27,570 --> 00:57:30,430
if you,
if you wanna if you want to be in a

1318
00:57:30,431 --> 00:57:31,900
certain industry,
it helps,

1319
00:57:32,320 --> 00:57:34,420
must win,
must be present to win,

1320
00:57:34,421 --> 00:57:36,150
you know,
uh,

1321
00:57:36,370 --> 00:57:37,520
to some degree,
you know,

1322
00:57:37,780 --> 00:57:40,810
um,
do you feel that that place has a

1323
00:57:40,970 --> 00:57:43,090
certain energy to it as well though?

1324
00:57:43,720 --> 00:57:46,480
It does have an energy to it and then
has had an interview to it and it's a

1325
00:57:46,481 --> 00:57:49,690
very changing energy at the moment.
Um,

1326
00:57:50,060 --> 00:57:51,790
I don't,
I don't live in Nashville proper

1327
00:57:51,880 --> 00:57:55,360
anymore,
but I did for years.

1328
00:57:55,420 --> 00:57:57,030
Um,
but it's uh,

1329
00:57:57,031 --> 00:57:58,180
it's a different place,
you know,

1330
00:57:58,181 --> 00:58:02,470
and it's not just a music place,
but there's so much else going on.

1331
00:58:02,480 --> 00:58:05,410
It was 19 or 20 cranes building condos
downtown,

1332
00:58:05,470 --> 00:58:07,120
you know,
what's going on in Nashville.

1333
00:58:07,150 --> 00:58:08,380
It just,
I don't know,

1334
00:58:08,381 --> 00:58:10,300
there's A.
Everybody wants to buy a condo.

1335
00:58:10,301 --> 00:58:13,990
I guess
I don't understand it,

1336
00:58:13,991 --> 00:58:15,620
but yeah,
it's,

1337
00:58:15,700 --> 00:58:19,510
there's an influx of people who all of a
sudden think it's a good idea to move to

1338
00:58:19,511 --> 00:58:21,320
Nashville.
Well,

1339
00:58:21,370 --> 00:58:23,020
that's what I had heard.
I'd heard that.

1340
00:58:23,021 --> 00:58:26,710
It's a,
it's almost becoming like La [inaudible]

1341
00:58:27,340 --> 00:58:28,960
a little bit.
I don't know what that means,

1342
00:58:28,990 --> 00:58:29,920
but if,
if that,

1343
00:58:30,100 --> 00:58:32,570
if that means that there's a lot of
condo buildings,

1344
00:58:33,460 --> 00:58:35,730
chicks with lips like this,
man,

1345
00:58:35,740 --> 00:58:36,573
I really don't.

1346
00:58:36,780 --> 00:58:37,750
Honestly,
I don't.

1347
00:58:38,950 --> 00:58:42,010
I don't run around and I go into
Nashville when I have to go into

1348
00:58:42,011 --> 00:58:45,550
Nashville for certain supplies for
supplies,

1349
00:58:46,780 --> 00:58:49,510
and then I parked myself in the,
out in the country.

1350
00:58:49,780 --> 00:58:50,810
So that's where you live.
Live.

1351
00:58:51,540 --> 00:58:52,960
That's nice.
Kind of spread.

1352
00:58:53,470 --> 00:58:55,450
Yeah.
We have a little bit of land and

1353
00:58:56,500 --> 00:58:58,040
wildlife animals.
Oh yeah.

1354
00:58:58,060 --> 00:59:00,010
None of those.
Bobcat's and Turkeys and.

1355
00:59:00,100 --> 00:59:00,940
Oh,
that's nice,

1356
00:59:00,970 --> 00:59:02,530
dear.
You name it.

1357
00:59:03,760 --> 00:59:05,350
Yeah.
The one I've heard about Nashville is

1358
00:59:05,351 --> 00:59:09,610
that Nashville started out as sort of
this pure sort of music environment and

1359
00:59:09,611 --> 00:59:13,830
then over time it became a money grab
and people realized that it's a,

1360
00:59:14,130 --> 00:59:16,090
um,
a music environment and they said,

1361
00:59:16,091 --> 00:59:18,490
how do we capitalize on this?
And then people said,

1362
00:59:18,491 --> 00:59:19,780
oh,
I heard this is a music environment.

1363
00:59:19,781 --> 00:59:21,980
I'm gonna move there.
And then it became like a

1364
00:59:21,980 --> 00:59:24,300
place to be,
to be seen and that it's,

1365
00:59:24,470 --> 00:59:29,470
it's still got the music there,
but it's also like weirdly compromised.

1366
00:59:30,050 --> 00:59:31,800
Does that make sense?
Uh,

1367
00:59:32,030 --> 00:59:34,040
no more than anywhere else.
I mean,

1368
00:59:34,041 --> 00:59:36,110
I said human nature,

1369
00:59:38,070 --> 00:59:39,090
man.
I don't know.

1370
00:59:39,130 --> 00:59:44,130
I don't want to say
it sounds very like I'm anti,

1371
00:59:46,840 --> 00:59:47,560
you know,
any,

1372
00:59:47,560 --> 00:59:49,480
any corporate involvement,
have anything to

1373
00:59:51,400 --> 00:59:52,330
say that it's been

1374
00:59:52,980 --> 00:59:53,420
okay.

1375
00:59:53,420 --> 00:59:55,350
Tainted or it's all a money grab or
something.

1376
00:59:56,110 --> 00:59:57,310
I don't think it's all.
I know.

1377
00:59:57,311 --> 00:59:59,600
I'm definitely not saying that.
I love Nashville by the way.

1378
00:59:59,710 --> 01:00:00,371
Okay.
Well No,

1379
01:00:00,371 --> 01:00:01,210
I,
I do too,

1380
01:00:01,211 --> 01:00:01,771
but I'm,
I'm,

1381
01:00:01,771 --> 01:00:04,150
I'm just trying to wrap my head around

1382
01:00:05,390 --> 01:00:07,620
the,
the relate opinion of.

1383
01:00:08,100 --> 01:00:09,380
Or was that your opinion?
No,

1384
01:00:09,470 --> 01:00:11,040
no,
it's other people that I know,

1385
01:00:11,041 --> 01:00:12,570
people that have lived there and then
moved back.

1386
01:00:12,780 --> 01:00:13,613
Got You.
Yeah.

1387
01:00:13,750 --> 01:00:16,200
I just,
people that had this romantic notion of

1388
01:00:16,201 --> 01:00:20,170
I want to go there and this is like sort
of countryish city where everybody's

1389
01:00:20,190 --> 01:00:22,820
soulful.
They're all singing songs and it's just,

1390
01:00:23,060 --> 01:00:26,820
he'd go down and see all these amateur
van or these bands are just starting out

1391
01:00:26,821 --> 01:00:27,654
and they're amazing.

1392
01:00:27,710 --> 01:00:29,390
Yeah.
I don't think that that's really,

1393
01:00:29,690 --> 01:00:31,820
uh,
that that's some kind of mayberry

1394
01:00:31,821 --> 01:00:33,190
version of,
of,

1395
01:00:33,220 --> 01:00:35,250
of what Nashville is.
I mean,

1396
01:00:35,360 --> 01:00:36,620
that's Narnia.
Yeah,

1397
01:00:36,621 --> 01:00:37,480
that's,
that's that.

1398
01:00:37,490 --> 01:00:40,850
I think that's some kind of Unicorn that
you're inventing in your mind.

1399
01:00:40,851 --> 01:00:43,600
If you think that that's any challenge
you're going to you like that.

1400
01:00:44,030 --> 01:00:46,490
There's like A.
I don't know,

1401
01:00:46,491 --> 01:00:47,690
I don't know what the equivalent would
be,

1402
01:00:47,691 --> 01:00:51,830
but feeling like you moved to some
island somewhere and everybody walks

1403
01:00:51,860 --> 01:00:55,730
around and has yachts and you know,
just just direct Martinez all day or

1404
01:00:55,731 --> 01:00:56,230
whatever.
You know,

1405
01:00:56,230 --> 01:00:59,600
it was just like,
that's not even true.

1406
01:00:59,610 --> 01:01:02,070
Well,
this like places that you're supposed to

1407
01:01:02,071 --> 01:01:03,720
go to.
Like when I was in Boston,

1408
01:01:03,750 --> 01:01:06,290
when I first started out doing standup,
I had heard about the comedy store.

1409
01:01:06,320 --> 01:01:09,840
That was like the Mecca rocky had to get
to the comedy store in Hollywood and I

1410
01:01:09,841 --> 01:01:13,740
was like spoken with harsh tones and
everybody sort of came to that place.

1411
01:01:13,741 --> 01:01:17,880
It's like a drew everybody in from
across the country and from my friends

1412
01:01:17,881 --> 01:01:19,950
like honey,
honey and other people that I know that

1413
01:01:19,951 --> 01:01:22,950
lived in Nashville for awhile.
That was Nashville was kind of that.

1414
01:01:22,951 --> 01:01:27,000
To them it's like what it was is like
this kind of place where you'd seen and

1415
01:01:27,001 --> 01:01:30,450
heard so much amazing music has come out
of that part of the world and it's so

1416
01:01:30,451 --> 01:01:32,430
music centered,
you know?

1417
01:01:32,431 --> 01:01:34,350
I mean,
it just,

1418
01:01:34,380 --> 01:01:36,930
it has a different vibe because it's a
very art.

1419
01:01:36,960 --> 01:01:38,730
It's a very artistic city.

1420
01:01:39,110 --> 01:01:40,180
Absolutely.
Yeah.

1421
01:01:40,590 --> 01:01:41,370
But,
but there's,

1422
01:01:41,370 --> 01:01:44,850
there's also,
there's a side to it now and it's been

1423
01:01:44,860 --> 01:01:46,630
the last five,
sorry,

1424
01:01:46,660 --> 01:01:48,190
Nashville,
if it feels like I'm talking about you,

1425
01:01:48,191 --> 01:01:49,650
but it's a,

1426
01:01:51,030 --> 01:01:56,030
there's a thing now where you go
downtown and it's more like you're going

1427
01:01:56,181 --> 01:01:58,080
to a giant Bachelorette party or
something,

1428
01:01:58,081 --> 01:01:59,740
you know,
it was just like every,

1429
01:01:59,820 --> 01:02:02,130
every bodies,
I don't know,

1430
01:02:02,160 --> 01:02:04,440
just looking to get,
drink their face and,

1431
01:02:04,530 --> 01:02:09,240
and listened to bad cover.
So what I'm saying like I'm sorry,

1432
01:02:09,280 --> 01:02:11,250
I need to apologize for,
okay,

1433
01:02:11,251 --> 01:02:13,380
you're being honest,
but it's,

1434
01:02:13,440 --> 01:02:15,000
you know,
and it's great for the city and a lot of

1435
01:02:15,001 --> 01:02:18,840
ways a tourism wise and monetarily and
all those.

1436
01:02:19,230 --> 01:02:22,050
But it also changes that uh,
whatever,

1437
01:02:22,051 --> 01:02:24,960
some notions of that romantic thing that
you're talking about,

1438
01:02:24,961 --> 01:02:26,790
those things still exist,
but they're there.

1439
01:02:27,120 --> 01:02:30,210
They have to be like a lot of things
that have sold.

1440
01:02:30,211 --> 01:02:32,380
They need to be sought out.
Right?

1441
01:02:32,460 --> 01:02:36,420
Like the difference between a real old
school bbq joint and Tgi Friday's.

1442
01:02:37,200 --> 01:02:40,020
I have nothing as Tgi Fridays,
but you know what you mean?

1443
01:02:40,150 --> 01:02:43,560
I know what you mean to.
I see.

1444
01:02:43,561 --> 01:02:45,820
You're laughing at me like back peddling
all the.

1445
01:02:45,900 --> 01:02:46,950
No,
no,

1446
01:02:46,951 --> 01:02:47,491
no,
no,

1447
01:02:47,491 --> 01:02:48,810
no.
Forced the end of this.

1448
01:02:48,811 --> 01:02:50,310
I didn't mean to.
I just,

1449
01:02:50,330 --> 01:02:51,750
we're just,
I'm just talking about,

1450
01:02:52,270 --> 01:02:56,760
but my point about all of it really is
the idea of artistic integrity is a

1451
01:02:56,761 --> 01:02:58,340
fleeting thing in,
in,

1452
01:02:58,350 --> 01:03:01,920
in a sacred thing and a critical thing
for a guy like you to create the kind of

1453
01:03:01,921 --> 01:03:06,921
music that you make and I'm always
interested like how someone cultivates

1454
01:03:07,291 --> 01:03:09,210
that,
how someone protects that.

1455
01:03:09,310 --> 01:03:11,790
Because I think it's,
it's what goes away.

1456
01:03:12,080 --> 01:03:14,640
It's when,
when things go off the rails,

1457
01:03:14,641 --> 01:03:19,460
it's usually the focus away from the
creative aspect of it going the art to

1458
01:03:19,650 --> 01:03:23,070
making the thing that you loved in the
beginning when you got into this thing,

1459
01:03:23,630 --> 01:03:25,020
you know,
and sometimes people get.

1460
01:03:25,140 --> 01:03:26,850
It happens.
Comedians in a big way,

1461
01:03:26,851 --> 01:03:31,851
they good movies and they become famous
and then they believe their own bullshit

1462
01:03:32,011 --> 01:03:33,750
and they put out these specials that are
terrible.

1463
01:03:33,751 --> 01:03:36,240
It's,
it's real easy to fall into.

1464
01:03:36,300 --> 01:03:36,940
Sure.

1465
01:03:36,940 --> 01:03:38,220
And Yeah.
And uh,

1466
01:03:38,320 --> 01:03:40,140
you know,
but there's also,

1467
01:03:40,141 --> 01:03:40,710
you know,
there's a,

1468
01:03:40,710 --> 01:03:45,590
there's a side of that I would,
I would argue that maybe that is what's

1469
01:03:45,591 --> 01:03:48,860
in their heart at that moment and that's
just as real as anything else,

1470
01:03:48,910 --> 01:03:50,350
you know,
but

1471
01:03:50,990 --> 01:03:52,970
I would argue that it's there in the
wrong environment.

1472
01:03:53,020 --> 01:03:57,170
Well has been surrounded by the wrong
people with the wrong influences and the

1473
01:03:57,171 --> 01:03:58,004
wrong.

1474
01:03:58,010 --> 01:04:00,220
Okay.
Yeah,

1475
01:04:01,140 --> 01:04:05,240
I'll go with that.
But everybody's going to evolve in one

1476
01:04:05,241 --> 01:04:06,660
way or another.
Yeah.

1477
01:04:08,530 --> 01:04:09,980
And,
and,

1478
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:12,910
and everybody's going to have these high
points and low points of,

1479
01:04:12,950 --> 01:04:15,980
of,
of where they really were in the zone,

1480
01:04:15,981 --> 01:04:18,590
so to speak or not in the zone.
Yeah.

1481
01:04:19,010 --> 01:04:22,220
Creatively,
I think that that is just life and um,

1482
01:04:23,960 --> 01:04:25,480
but I,
you know,

1483
01:04:25,490 --> 01:04:30,490
I dunno as long for me if there's a way
to try to preserve some notion of

1484
01:04:34,460 --> 01:04:37,640
integrity.
It's just that thing I sent earlier.

1485
01:04:37,641 --> 01:04:42,641
It's just like if you let all the other
stuff just put the blinders on and go,

1486
01:04:43,680 --> 01:04:46,350
alright,
here I am here,

1487
01:04:46,370 --> 01:04:50,510
here are the guys that I played music
with and then the girls were going to

1488
01:04:50,511 --> 01:04:51,860
sit in a room,
what are we going to do,

1489
01:04:52,580 --> 01:04:56,150
what will we do if none of this other
stuff existed and that's.

1490
01:04:56,230 --> 01:04:58,280
And that's,
that's the way you keep it,

1491
01:04:59,000 --> 01:05:04,000
which should be as you keep it right in
the moment and right into the room and

1492
01:05:05,871 --> 01:05:10,871
don't let some of some notion of trying
to outdo yourself for a out sell

1493
01:05:13,401 --> 01:05:17,280
yourself or you know,
make more money than the other guy or,

1494
01:05:17,370 --> 01:05:20,680
or having number one over top of the
other guy or you know,

1495
01:05:20,740 --> 01:05:24,730
because all that kind of stuff's
manufacturer two number ones and those

1496
01:05:24,731 --> 01:05:25,750
are just numbers that.

1497
01:05:25,800 --> 01:05:30,800
And some of them are so a tainted by
people just doing things that,

1498
01:05:33,610 --> 01:05:38,440
that manufacturer,
that number that they want to have that

1499
01:05:38,870 --> 01:05:41,200
it doesn't,
it's not even a real thing at that

1500
01:05:41,201 --> 01:05:43,770
point.
I don't know why.

1501
01:05:43,780 --> 01:05:48,780
I always felt weird about contests and
things that in any sort of like ranking

1502
01:05:49,091 --> 01:05:52,670
system that involves art.
Okay,

1503
01:05:52,780 --> 01:05:55,020
so your way anti,
any kind of.

1504
01:05:55,660 --> 01:05:57,760
Well,
I just think that like the Oscars and

1505
01:05:57,761 --> 01:05:59,540
the grammys and all that kind of shit
like that.

1506
01:05:59,541 --> 01:06:02,680
Like I don't give a fuck who you think
is great.

1507
01:06:03,120 --> 01:06:04,960
I don't think.
I don't care who you think is the

1508
01:06:04,961 --> 01:06:06,730
greatest number one,
like the number.

1509
01:06:06,731 --> 01:06:09,520
Here's the end.
The winter is open the envelope.

1510
01:06:09,521 --> 01:06:10,510
Oh my God.
Is he going to get it?

1511
01:06:10,880 --> 01:06:13,600
Like the work is the work,
the work is done.

1512
01:06:13,601 --> 01:06:16,030
Like it's.
If it's apocalypse now is a great

1513
01:06:16,031 --> 01:06:18,190
fucking movie.
It doesn't matter what you give them a

1514
01:06:18,191 --> 01:06:21,940
gold statue or not like what's the work?
The work is great.

1515
01:06:22,170 --> 01:06:25,480
Like for it to win a thing or not when a
thing,

1516
01:06:25,870 --> 01:06:27,400
you know in some of the things that have
one,

1517
01:06:27,401 --> 01:06:32,260
you can tell that the wind is tainted by
the political climate that the people

1518
01:06:32,261 --> 01:06:35,790
are like leaning towards something
that's socially aware and console.

1519
01:06:35,800 --> 01:06:38,950
Somebody made a movie with lesbians and
Save the planet from.

1520
01:06:39,250 --> 01:06:41,820
You know what I mean?
It's like that kind of shit becomes

1521
01:06:42,070 --> 01:06:45,490
transparent and obvious and you can do
that in rig the system and win an award.

1522
01:06:45,910 --> 01:06:50,910
I think that awards for art or goofy
awards for comedy or super every comedy

1523
01:06:52,181 --> 01:06:54,760
competition I've ever seen.
They're super goofy.

1524
01:06:55,270 --> 01:06:58,090
It's just,
it's missing the whole idea of the

1525
01:06:58,091 --> 01:06:59,170
thing,
the whole idea.

1526
01:06:59,171 --> 01:07:02,230
The thing is supposed to be the art.
It's not supposed to be trying to win an

1527
01:07:02,231 --> 01:07:03,064
award.

1528
01:07:03,350 --> 01:07:05,090
No,
it's not and,

1529
01:07:06,390 --> 01:07:08,780
but you know,
if you want an award out of that and it

1530
01:07:08,781 --> 01:07:12,320
allows you to make more art and it makes
people pay attention to the art.

1531
01:07:12,321 --> 01:07:17,270
So it's sort of a bastardization.
It's always felt like there was a show

1532
01:07:17,271 --> 01:07:19,970
called last comic standing and the good
thing about it was it,

1533
01:07:19,971 --> 01:07:22,790
it got a lot of comics that people
hadn't heard of and they put them on

1534
01:07:22,791 --> 01:07:23,624
television,

1535
01:07:23,950 --> 01:07:26,320
the career,
but the bad thing was that they're doing

1536
01:07:26,321 --> 01:07:30,530
like a contest and like who's the
audience platform or do you want Mike?

1537
01:07:30,531 --> 01:07:32,230
Hey,
what about debbie?

1538
01:07:34,140 --> 01:07:36,220
That's fucking weird.
It's weird.

1539
01:07:36,310 --> 01:07:38,710
Okay.
We have a lot of those shows.

1540
01:07:38,890 --> 01:07:40,360
Yes,
there's not as many anymore.

1541
01:07:40,361 --> 01:07:41,660
A lot of from the singing,
right.

1542
01:07:41,670 --> 01:07:45,210
That's what I'm saying.
People like to watch those shows because

1543
01:07:45,260 --> 01:07:50,260
people also like the idea that you can
be one thing,

1544
01:07:50,681 --> 01:07:54,880
one minute and one moment on television
can make you some other totally

1545
01:07:54,881 --> 01:07:58,030
different person below them on that.
Like that's why Susan Boyle was so

1546
01:07:58,031 --> 01:07:59,100
famous,
right?

1547
01:07:59,110 --> 01:08:01,630
Yes.
We saw this woman.

1548
01:08:01,870 --> 01:08:05,860
Everybody was doubting her.
She goes out there and she's got pipes

1549
01:08:06,220 --> 01:08:10,040
and she belts that song out and you can
see Simon who's just a douche bag

1550
01:08:10,210 --> 01:08:11,830
because was like,
Holy Shit.

1551
01:08:12,310 --> 01:08:15,500
She's amazing.
Like you could see it like undeniable.

1552
01:08:16,670 --> 01:08:19,430
But those were good moments though.
Those are good moments.

1553
01:08:19,460 --> 01:08:22,640
Those are the best moments.
The other good moments are like when

1554
01:08:22,641 --> 01:08:24,710
they have American idol,
they have those people that have no

1555
01:08:24,711 --> 01:08:27,380
business being there and they played
their auditions too.

1556
01:08:28,480 --> 01:08:30,320
Those are the other good moments for the
wrong reasons,

1557
01:08:30,321 --> 01:08:32,180
right?
Yes.

1558
01:08:32,300 --> 01:08:35,180
But you know,
and if you're watching that show that

1559
01:08:35,181 --> 01:08:36,800
you're watching it for that too.
Right.

1560
01:08:37,280 --> 01:08:40,130
Is there a good show to introduce people
to country music?

1561
01:08:40,131 --> 01:08:40,510
Like,
you know,

1562
01:08:40,510 --> 01:08:44,870
they used to have.
There used to be like shows where people

1563
01:08:44,871 --> 01:08:45,780
could,
you know,

1564
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:46,940
yeah,
we used to have,

1565
01:08:46,960 --> 01:08:49,010
you know,
like Nashville now and tell you like,

1566
01:08:49,870 --> 01:08:51,890
I don't think that really exists
anymore.

1567
01:08:51,920 --> 01:08:54,620
Like A,
like a country music was specific show.

1568
01:08:55,230 --> 01:08:56,210
No,
I don't think we really have that

1569
01:08:56,211 --> 01:08:57,410
anymore.
Like a variety show,

1570
01:08:57,440 --> 01:08:59,990
like Johnny Cash show or a show or
something like that.

1571
01:09:00,470 --> 01:09:02,780
No,
we don't have that anymore and I don't

1572
01:09:02,781 --> 01:09:05,720
know how much people want that anymore,
you know,

1573
01:09:05,750 --> 01:09:09,320
otherwise it might exist but one person
to do it,

1574
01:09:09,321 --> 01:09:11,330
you know,
maybe maybe there's not the right person

1575
01:09:11,331 --> 01:09:11,660
to do it.

1576
01:09:11,660 --> 01:09:14,210
I don't know.
I just think someone needs to make it.

1577
01:09:14,350 --> 01:09:17,720
I feel like there's so much what you're
telling me about all these artists I got

1578
01:09:17,721 --> 01:09:20,270
to go look into and I'm sure there's a
bunch that are coming up that are

1579
01:09:20,271 --> 01:09:24,950
probably equally talented and you know,
maybe they just need an opportunity like

1580
01:09:24,951 --> 01:09:26,870
that.
Like something like along those lines,

1581
01:09:26,871 --> 01:09:28,560
some sort of a show,
a variety show.

1582
01:09:28,561 --> 01:09:31,790
Our really talented people can come and
show their songs,

1583
01:09:32,780 --> 01:09:33,790
but it'd be good.
I,

1584
01:09:33,800 --> 01:09:34,230
you know,
my,

1585
01:09:34,230 --> 01:09:34,851
my,
well,

1586
01:09:34,851 --> 01:09:37,640
the closest thing to that right now,
have you seen this Mike Judge show the

1587
01:09:38,770 --> 01:09:42,130
Mike Judge,
the guy from King of the hill and uh,

1588
01:09:42,320 --> 01:09:45,370
it's Beavis and butthead tales from the
tour bus or something like that.

1589
01:09:45,410 --> 01:09:46,610
What is that?
He takes,

1590
01:09:46,640 --> 01:09:50,010
he talks to all these old school like
Texas country acts or,

1591
01:09:50,020 --> 01:09:54,560
or like it's all these,
all the folklore of country music and

1592
01:09:54,561 --> 01:09:57,800
these and he doesn't like interview
style and they're all telling me stories

1593
01:09:59,440 --> 01:10:00,860
and latest trailer.
Oh Man.

1594
01:10:02,680 --> 01:10:03,440
Mike judge.

1595
01:10:03,440 --> 01:10:04,273
Yeah.
He'll

1596
01:10:05,560 --> 01:10:10,560
be at 36 brand new cars.
The horn sound like a dying.

1597
01:10:12,680 --> 01:10:15,570
Wow.
Jerry machine gun.

1598
01:10:15,660 --> 01:10:19,940
Shot up a demo right next door.
$50,000 with false teeth.

1599
01:10:20,250 --> 01:10:23,290
I knew that he was facing his shoes and
I didn't want me in the lab.

1600
01:10:26,610 --> 01:10:29,040
So they would tell stories and then they
animate them.

1601
01:10:29,230 --> 01:10:30,990
Yeah.
Well this is what all these guys that

1602
01:10:30,991 --> 01:10:33,450
you see are animated.
These are the real guys that lived a lot

1603
01:10:33,451 --> 01:10:35,310
of these things.
Telling these stories.

1604
01:10:35,720 --> 01:10:37,850
This is,
these are not made up characters or in

1605
01:10:37,851 --> 01:10:39,120
any,
in any way.

1606
01:10:39,121 --> 01:10:41,430
And,
and I know some of the guys that wind up

1607
01:10:41,431 --> 01:10:44,910
being animated on these things and,
and I have for years said,

1608
01:10:44,940 --> 01:10:47,490
you know,
if even half of the folk lore that

1609
01:10:47,491 --> 01:10:50,780
exists in country music could be told,
uh,

1610
01:10:50,880 --> 01:10:52,880
it would be the,
it would be the biggest thing in the

1611
01:10:52,890 --> 01:10:53,610
world,
you know,

1612
01:10:53,610 --> 01:10:56,610
and that's what he's doing right now
with that show and he's doing an

1613
01:10:56,611 --> 01:10:59,550
excellent job of it and it's really for
me,

1614
01:10:59,640 --> 01:11:01,110
and maybe it's not as entertaining to
other people,

1615
01:11:01,111 --> 01:11:02,820
I don't know,
but for me as a musician,

1616
01:11:02,821 --> 01:11:04,210
no one,
no one,

1617
01:11:04,211 --> 01:11:08,740
some of the folk lore and knowing how
many great characters and storytellers

1618
01:11:08,750 --> 01:11:11,610
exists in country music and have
existed.

1619
01:11:11,700 --> 01:11:15,120
Um,
it's so refreshing to see these guys get

1620
01:11:15,121 --> 01:11:17,040
stories told about him.
That's awesome.

1621
01:11:17,041 --> 01:11:19,440
I didn't even know Mike Judge's a
country music fan.

1622
01:11:19,620 --> 01:11:21,690
I didn't either,
but I got to tell you,

1623
01:11:21,780 --> 01:11:25,020
he's knocking it out of the park as far
as I'm concerned with this,

1624
01:11:25,140 --> 01:11:26,940
with this,
with this TV show.

1625
01:11:26,941 --> 01:11:29,370
I hope it does really well.
I'm so glad you brought this up.

1626
01:11:29,940 --> 01:11:31,680
Yeah,
it looks hilarious.

1627
01:11:31,700 --> 01:11:32,730
It's,
it's awesome.

1628
01:11:33,650 --> 01:11:38,370
And I don't say that about much,
I don't really like get super pumped up

1629
01:11:38,371 --> 01:11:40,140
about a lot.
Do you watch other shit?

1630
01:11:40,500 --> 01:11:41,071
Yeah.
You know,

1631
01:11:41,071 --> 01:11:42,780
I like a lot of um,
I like,

1632
01:11:43,180 --> 01:11:48,180
I mean some pretty obvious things like
game of thrones and walking dead.

1633
01:11:48,721 --> 01:11:49,980
I'm ended that.
I like,

1634
01:11:50,310 --> 01:11:53,600
I like kind of science fiction based
things and uh,

1635
01:11:53,670 --> 01:11:54,810
you know,
I liked but I liked,

1636
01:11:55,890 --> 01:11:57,750
I like things that are done well,
whatever it is.

1637
01:11:57,840 --> 01:12:01,380
And I think both of those were done well
to do you binge watch TV shows?

1638
01:12:01,470 --> 01:12:03,120
Absolutely.
That's the only way I can watch the TV

1639
01:12:03,121 --> 01:12:03,690
show,
you know,

1640
01:12:03,690 --> 01:12:06,100
because half the time I'm doing
something when,

1641
01:12:06,160 --> 01:12:07,550
when it actually comes on,
you know?

1642
01:12:08,080 --> 01:12:08,913
Right,
right.

1643
01:12:09,700 --> 01:12:13,420
So when you look at yourself right now
and you look at all this cool shit that

1644
01:12:13,421 --> 01:12:17,020
you're doing,
do you hope that just keep doing it this

1645
01:12:17,021 --> 01:12:18,730
way?
Do you have some grand plans?

1646
01:12:19,540 --> 01:12:22,340
We,
we far surpassed any grand plan that I

1647
01:12:22,341 --> 01:12:26,600
might've had collected years ago.
So I'm,

1648
01:12:27,350 --> 01:12:30,200
I'm,
I'm hopeful that we get to continue to

1649
01:12:30,201 --> 01:12:33,680
do some cool things and have fun doing
it.

1650
01:12:33,681 --> 01:12:35,240
And I'm,
you know,

1651
01:12:35,560 --> 01:12:37,130
I'm,
I'm,

1652
01:12:37,220 --> 01:12:38,710
I'm at that age where,
you know,

1653
01:12:38,930 --> 01:12:42,710
I'm just old enough not to be stupid
with what we're doing and

1654
01:12:44,270 --> 01:12:48,400
hopefully young enough to really get to
keep doing it for a little while and,

1655
01:12:48,500 --> 01:12:50,720
and I,
you know,

1656
01:12:50,910 --> 01:12:51,920
I don't know,
man,

1657
01:12:51,940 --> 01:12:53,930
I,
I'm grateful for anything that we've

1658
01:12:53,931 --> 01:12:58,040
gotten to do and we'll get to do in the
future and hopefully the next few years

1659
01:12:58,041 --> 01:13:00,980
will just be a continuation of that.

1660
01:13:02,190 --> 01:13:04,230
That's all you could ask for Matt.
I mean,

1661
01:13:04,231 --> 01:13:06,900
if you're,
what what you're doing now is so awesome

1662
01:13:06,901 --> 01:13:07,740
and so much fun.

1663
01:13:08,510 --> 01:13:09,201
Yeah,
I can't,

1664
01:13:09,201 --> 01:13:12,740
I can't imagine if I,
if I could like write a script for how,

1665
01:13:13,850 --> 01:13:17,330
you know,
this is how the curve of I want my

1666
01:13:17,360 --> 01:13:20,180
career of putting records out to go.
I couldn't,

1667
01:13:20,210 --> 01:13:22,760
I couldn't write it any better for me,
you know,

1668
01:13:22,761 --> 01:13:27,410
and I get to do,
have freedom to do basically whatever I

1669
01:13:27,411 --> 01:13:32,411
want and I'm in play however I want and
I'm saying about whatever I want.

1670
01:13:33,561 --> 01:13:33,990
And,
and,

1671
01:13:33,990 --> 01:13:35,960
and that's,
it's,

1672
01:13:35,990 --> 01:13:38,570
it's the,
it's the greatest thing in the world.

1673
01:13:39,380 --> 01:13:43,100
Do you get young guys coming up to her
young girls coming up to you that have

1674
01:13:43,101 --> 01:13:46,190
dreams of being a singer songwriter?
Sure.

1675
01:13:46,220 --> 01:13:48,030
Asked you for advice?
Yeah,

1676
01:13:48,031 --> 01:13:49,970
and my advice has always just be nice,
you know,

1677
01:13:50,270 --> 01:13:51,290
be nice,
be nice.

1678
01:13:51,291 --> 01:13:52,070
Yeah.
Really?

1679
01:13:52,070 --> 01:13:53,150
Yeah.
Well I think that's,

1680
01:13:53,180 --> 01:13:57,920
you know,
I think that's always easier than making

1681
01:13:57,921 --> 01:13:59,920
too many enemies or you know,
and it,

1682
01:13:59,921 --> 01:14:00,760
you know,
the,

1683
01:14:00,880 --> 01:14:04,190
you know,
you inevitably have people that don't

1684
01:14:04,191 --> 01:14:06,260
believe in what you do or thing that's
just,

1685
01:14:07,220 --> 01:14:08,090
that's all.

1686
01:14:08,150 --> 01:14:10,250
That's a subjective thing.
Of course.

1687
01:14:10,610 --> 01:14:12,370
Yeah.
Yeah.

1688
01:14:12,371 --> 01:14:14,350
Being nice is important,
but also being you,

1689
01:14:14,380 --> 01:14:15,620
be you and be nice,
you know?

1690
01:14:15,690 --> 01:14:18,350
And if you do those two things,
um,

1691
01:14:18,880 --> 01:14:23,050
I think that's the best recipe to
hopefully,

1692
01:14:23,200 --> 01:14:23,890
uh,
for,

1693
01:14:23,890 --> 01:14:26,680
for you to put yourself into the
position to get lucky.

1694
01:14:27,100 --> 01:14:28,930
Is this something that you had to figure
out yourself?

1695
01:14:30,340 --> 01:14:32,140
Um,
yeah,

1696
01:14:32,540 --> 01:14:34,120
yeah.
I mean,

1697
01:14:34,690 --> 01:14:38,440
but you know,
when you start and I don't know how it

1698
01:14:38,441 --> 01:14:42,520
works from your end,
what you do when you start and when you

1699
01:14:42,521 --> 01:14:44,170
get your first little,
you know,

1700
01:14:44,171 --> 01:14:48,340
I get a publishing deal and then you get
to be around some of what an industry is

1701
01:14:48,341 --> 01:14:53,140
and then you slowly but surely get to
meet people who are successful in

1702
01:14:53,141 --> 01:14:58,030
different facets of it.
And I think what I find is the people

1703
01:14:58,031 --> 01:15:00,670
that I,
that I gravitate towards and that I

1704
01:15:00,671 --> 01:15:03,940
really respect and look at it and go,
hey,

1705
01:15:03,941 --> 01:15:06,910
I career like that would be nice.
You know,

1706
01:15:07,790 --> 01:15:09,360
they're very nice,
you know,

1707
01:15:09,520 --> 01:15:11,350
caring,
giving the individuals who,

1708
01:15:11,980 --> 01:15:15,220
who support younger artists and they um,
you know,

1709
01:15:15,221 --> 01:15:17,980
they do nice things for the community
and they do nice things for people out

1710
01:15:17,981 --> 01:15:21,700
in the world and um,
and they make music that's in their

1711
01:15:21,701 --> 01:15:24,070
heart and those are the,
those are the things that

1712
01:15:25,900 --> 01:15:30,900
I think are,
are good to aspire to as a musician.

1713
01:15:31,330 --> 01:15:32,110
And

1714
01:15:32,110 --> 01:15:33,880
those are the things I respect.
I respect.

1715
01:15:34,420 --> 01:15:35,700
I respect that.
Yeah.

1716
01:15:35,980 --> 01:15:38,440
A whole lot.
Not just talented but nice.

1717
01:15:38,530 --> 01:15:39,420
Yeah.
Yeah.

1718
01:15:39,880 --> 01:15:43,040
Now what about like a work ethic or did
the,

1719
01:15:43,080 --> 01:15:47,410
do you have people asking questions
about like how do you motivate yourself

1720
01:15:47,411 --> 01:15:49,960
or how do you,
how do you sit down and write?

1721
01:15:49,961 --> 01:15:51,550
How do you like,
what's your process?

1722
01:15:52,150 --> 01:15:55,280
Uh,
you do as a like what is my advice to

1723
01:15:55,281 --> 01:15:57,110
them?
Like I say,

1724
01:15:57,111 --> 01:15:57,531
right,
you know,

1725
01:15:57,531 --> 01:15:59,690
write as much as you can with as many
people as you can,

1726
01:15:59,691 --> 01:16:03,550
find who know what they're doing and um,
that's,

1727
01:16:03,750 --> 01:16:05,490
that's how you learn how to write songs.
But I,

1728
01:16:05,491 --> 01:16:07,320
you know,
I'll also say you should have a song

1729
01:16:07,321 --> 01:16:08,320
writer friend who said,
you know,

1730
01:16:08,321 --> 01:16:09,154
you,
you can't,

1731
01:16:09,620 --> 01:16:14,060
you can't learn how to be a songwriter.
You can learn how to write better songs

1732
01:16:14,061 --> 01:16:16,460
more often,
but it's not,

1733
01:16:16,490 --> 01:16:17,570
you know,
it's like,

1734
01:16:17,590 --> 01:16:18,100
and,
and I,

1735
01:16:18,100 --> 01:16:19,090
and um,
forgive me,

1736
01:16:19,110 --> 01:16:22,280
this is a wrong analogy,
but I don't think you can really learn

1737
01:16:22,281 --> 01:16:23,114
how to be funny

1738
01:16:24,500 --> 01:16:26,090
if you're a comedian.
I used to think that,

1739
01:16:26,480 --> 01:16:28,990
I used to think that because I think,
well,

1740
01:16:28,991 --> 01:16:30,950
you're the funny or not funny.
And then I realized like,

1741
01:16:30,951 --> 01:16:32,420
oh,
some people need to learn how to be

1742
01:16:32,421 --> 01:16:35,240
comfortable enough to be funny.
Yeah.

1743
01:16:35,330 --> 01:16:38,210
I've met people that sucked and then
they got good.

1744
01:16:38,510 --> 01:16:39,560
Really,
really good.

1745
01:16:39,561 --> 01:16:41,600
That's.
That's well I'm giving the wrong advice

1746
01:16:41,601 --> 01:16:46,310
then because I personally,
I personally think like some of it has

1747
01:16:46,311 --> 01:16:49,790
to be innate and then you have to learn
how to sharpen that tool a little bit.

1748
01:16:50,060 --> 01:16:52,760
Well,
I think whoever you are can change.

1749
01:16:53,060 --> 01:16:58,060
And I think if you are in a position
where you are incapable of writing songs

1750
01:16:58,161 --> 01:17:01,670
or incapable of being funny or incapable
of writing books or doing paintings,

1751
01:17:01,671 --> 01:17:03,860
whatever it is,
it's because of whoever you are right

1752
01:17:03,861 --> 01:17:04,820
now,
but that doesn't mean,

1753
01:17:04,821 --> 01:17:07,250
and whoever you are right now is who
you're going to be five years from now

1754
01:17:07,251 --> 01:17:08,084
or whatever.

1755
01:17:08,150 --> 01:17:12,780
I think if you can go enough personal
growth and enough introspective thinking

1756
01:17:12,781 --> 01:17:16,400
and objective realization of your
environment and then the way you

1757
01:17:16,401 --> 01:17:21,380
interface with people slowly but surely
changes and evolves and matures your art

1758
01:17:21,381 --> 01:17:23,030
will your,
your expression well,

1759
01:17:23,031 --> 01:17:26,000
because you're not who you are.
You know you're not who you were five

1760
01:17:26,001 --> 01:17:27,860
years ago.
You're not who you were 10 years ago.

1761
01:17:27,950 --> 01:17:30,770
Okay.
This is my thought.

1762
01:17:30,771 --> 01:17:31,341
I mean,
it doesn't.

1763
01:17:31,341 --> 01:17:33,650
I don't think it works with everybody.
There's some people that just aren't

1764
01:17:33,651 --> 01:17:36,230
fucking funny.
Don't get me wrong.

1765
01:17:36,500 --> 01:17:39,920
But I used to think that there was just,
if you sucked in the beginning,

1766
01:17:39,921 --> 01:17:42,080
you're going to suck.
And then I met

1767
01:17:42,250 --> 01:17:44,370
people.
There will be some spark,

1768
01:17:44,670 --> 01:17:46,890
spark or drive,
you know,

1769
01:17:46,910 --> 01:17:48,390
like,
uh,

1770
01:17:48,500 --> 01:17:53,500
I think if would you say that if the
person that was trying to be funny was

1771
01:17:54,250 --> 01:17:56,170
not funny at first,
they at least knew that they weren't

1772
01:17:56,171 --> 01:17:57,340
funding and had to get better at it?

1773
01:17:57,450 --> 01:18:00,500
No,
no.

1774
01:18:00,560 --> 01:18:03,780
Sometimes they think they're funny and
then they become funny and select is.

1775
01:18:04,030 --> 01:18:09,020
I used to think that there was much more
of a clear defined pattern then I think

1776
01:18:09,021 --> 01:18:10,380
now.
Um,

1777
01:18:10,850 --> 01:18:15,850
but I think it's about being clueless.
I think cluelessness is the enemy of any

1778
01:18:16,970 --> 01:18:19,400
real.
Anything that you're going to make

1779
01:18:19,520 --> 01:18:21,320
that's going to have a real impact on
people.

1780
01:18:21,321 --> 01:18:22,700
If you're,
if you're clueless,

1781
01:18:23,180 --> 01:18:25,370
have you done.
Don't see how people perceive you.

1782
01:18:25,700 --> 01:18:28,910
If you're not aware of how they're
taking you in,

1783
01:18:28,911 --> 01:18:32,250
when you're communicating with them,
your art is gonna suck.

1784
01:18:32,620 --> 01:18:34,670
Like you don't have a connection with
them.

1785
01:18:34,730 --> 01:18:36,560
You don't have a connection with people,
you don't have a connection with

1786
01:18:36,561 --> 01:18:39,920
yourself.
I think unless there's some sort of a

1787
01:18:40,070 --> 01:18:44,360
solitary thing that you do,
like maybe maybe sculpting or painting

1788
01:18:44,370 --> 01:18:48,050
like can be a madman is like totally
like in your own world and create some

1789
01:18:48,051 --> 01:18:50,360
crazy art form that someone can come
along and look at and go,

1790
01:18:50,361 --> 01:18:52,730
wow,
but anything where you're interacting

1791
01:18:52,731 --> 01:18:55,280
with people,
I think there's a big part of that

1792
01:18:55,281 --> 01:19:00,281
interaction is the way you look through
other people's eyes and the way they

1793
01:19:01,011 --> 01:19:03,980
take in what you're saying,
not just what you want to get out,

1794
01:19:04,340 --> 01:19:06,110
but also you are recognition.

1795
01:19:06,110 --> 01:19:08,090
Some sort of either peripherally or
whether it's,

1796
01:19:08,091 --> 01:19:09,920
uh,
obviously your,

1797
01:19:09,950 --> 01:19:14,000
your realization of how they're
perceiving your thoughts and ideas and

1798
01:19:14,001 --> 01:19:17,150
what,
what vehicle you're delivering these

1799
01:19:17,151 --> 01:19:20,330
ideas in.
Is it clunky and too loud or do you have

1800
01:19:20,331 --> 01:19:25,331
the same thought and make it smooth and
calm and sinking into people with the

1801
01:19:26,001 --> 01:19:28,460
right words and the right cadence.
And the right,

1802
01:19:28,670 --> 01:19:30,710
you can have the same ideas but they
just,

1803
01:19:31,040 --> 01:19:34,460
they need a better vehicle to get
through and I think cluelessness

1804
01:19:34,461 --> 01:19:39,080
prevents you from objectively analyzing
your own work.

1805
01:19:39,830 --> 01:19:41,030
Gotcha.
So self awareness,

1806
01:19:41,480 --> 01:19:45,110
self awareness is really important part
and brutal honesty,

1807
01:19:45,250 --> 01:19:46,340
you know,
with yourself.

1808
01:19:46,380 --> 01:19:47,213
Yeah.

1809
01:19:48,330 --> 01:19:49,740
I'll,
I'll go with that.

1810
01:19:50,210 --> 01:19:52,100
Yeah,
I mean you must have that with songs,

1811
01:19:52,101 --> 01:19:54,740
right?
Like do you have songs where you write

1812
01:19:54,890 --> 01:19:56,960
and then you go back and what the fuck
is this?

1813
01:19:57,930 --> 01:19:59,970
Absolutely.
Absolutely.

1814
01:19:59,971 --> 01:20:03,280
You know,
but you also have songs where,

1815
01:20:03,650 --> 01:20:05,180
uh,
you know,

1816
01:20:05,370 --> 01:20:07,860
your rights every day you write a song,
you get done,

1817
01:20:08,370 --> 01:20:10,860
you don't get to the end of the day
without thinking that you did something

1818
01:20:10,861 --> 01:20:13,170
good,
but it's only on,

1819
01:20:13,530 --> 01:20:15,360
you know,
you got to get away from it a little bit

1820
01:20:15,361 --> 01:20:19,200
and then like read,
listened to it or reexamine it and go

1821
01:20:19,600 --> 01:20:21,610
eh.
Or Hey,

1822
01:20:22,740 --> 01:20:25,080
you know that.
So I don't,

1823
01:20:25,140 --> 01:20:29,670
I think it's easy to feel like you were
a genius in the moment as a song.

1824
01:20:30,300 --> 01:20:31,590
Especially.
We've got a couple of drinks.

1825
01:20:31,710 --> 01:20:32,543
Yeah,
absolutely.

1826
01:20:34,830 --> 01:20:35,870
Do you,
um,

1827
01:20:36,420 --> 01:20:41,190
like how much of the stuff that you
actually write becomes a song that you

1828
01:20:41,191 --> 01:20:42,360
publish?
Like,

1829
01:20:42,520 --> 01:20:46,230
like say if you're,
if you're writing like how many of the

1830
01:20:46,231 --> 01:20:50,280
days spent do you,
does it actually come out to be like a

1831
01:20:50,281 --> 01:20:53,850
full song,
a song in three hours?

1832
01:20:53,910 --> 01:20:55,960
Really.
But you can also not right spending

1833
01:20:56,050 --> 01:20:56,820
three hours,
right?

1834
01:20:56,820 --> 01:20:58,160
Yeah.
If I don't want to,

1835
01:20:58,170 --> 01:20:59,760
I'm like,
are you asking if there's like a

1836
01:20:59,761 --> 01:21:01,020
schedule to.
Oh No,

1837
01:21:01,021 --> 01:21:01,321
no,
no.

1838
01:21:01,321 --> 01:21:04,800
I mean like how much of it like really,
really connects with you.

1839
01:21:04,801 --> 01:21:09,270
Like I'm sure you must be sitting.
Sometimes you sit down and on the first

1840
01:21:09,271 --> 01:21:11,130
draft you just fucking nail it.
Right?

1841
01:21:12,680 --> 01:21:14,250
You've got an inspiration to me every
time.

1842
01:21:14,251 --> 01:21:18,660
No,
but I'm just trying to see if there's

1843
01:21:18,661 --> 01:21:22,650
parallels between ca because comedy is
probably 10 to 1:10 things.

1844
01:21:22,651 --> 01:21:26,070
I write a bullshit and one thing that my
mom might be something there.

1845
01:21:26,410 --> 01:21:27,001
Yeah.
I think.

1846
01:21:27,001 --> 01:21:28,800
I think if you're doing,
if you're doing,

1847
01:21:29,550 --> 01:21:31,680
if you're doing 10 percent of what you
do is,

1848
01:21:32,310 --> 01:21:35,010
is,
is worked at Judeen good enough to put

1849
01:21:35,011 --> 01:21:37,260
out in the world.
I think you're probably doing pretty

1850
01:21:37,261 --> 01:21:37,560
good.

1851
01:21:37,560 --> 01:21:38,460
I mean,
I think that's,

1852
01:21:39,080 --> 01:21:40,980
that's a pretty good average,
uh,

1853
01:21:41,160 --> 01:21:44,810
of things that are worth something,
you know,

1854
01:21:44,820 --> 01:21:47,370
you hope for better,
but that if you're doing that,

1855
01:21:47,371 --> 01:21:49,230
I think that's doing your job,
but you got to go.

1856
01:21:49,450 --> 01:21:53,910
I also believes you've got to go through
some of the ones that aren't there just

1857
01:21:53,911 --> 01:21:56,850
to kind of flush them out.
You have to get the,

1858
01:21:56,940 --> 01:21:58,370
you have to get that out.
Otherwise they,

1859
01:21:58,430 --> 01:22:01,200
it,
it stuck there and it's gonna mess with

1860
01:22:01,201 --> 01:22:02,160
everything I should do.
And just,

1861
01:22:02,220 --> 01:22:03,120
just,
you know,

1862
01:22:03,540 --> 01:22:05,520
if there's something on your mind to
work on,

1863
01:22:05,670 --> 01:22:08,520
work on it to the end,
make it the best you can.

1864
01:22:08,521 --> 01:22:10,380
Make it,
then look at it and go,

1865
01:22:10,410 --> 01:22:12,930
hey,
was this really something I should have

1866
01:22:12,931 --> 01:22:15,090
worked on?
Yes or no?

1867
01:22:15,091 --> 01:22:18,060
And then just,
then you can push it out and kind of

1868
01:22:18,061 --> 01:22:20,370
move on.
I think that's important to kind of

1869
01:22:20,371 --> 01:22:22,680
flush out your,
your mind that way creatively.

1870
01:22:22,950 --> 01:22:25,350
Do you ever come back to your stuff like
sort of almost like,

1871
01:22:25,610 --> 01:22:28,800
like come back to it when you haven't
thought about it in forever and look at

1872
01:22:28,801 --> 01:22:31,020
it with fresh eyes,
like almost like you're collaborating

1873
01:22:31,021 --> 01:22:36,021
with somebody else and now I'm very much
the guy who believes like the first

1874
01:22:36,121 --> 01:22:39,870
instinct is probably the correct one
most of the time.

1875
01:22:40,020 --> 01:22:42,960
Interesting.
I don't like to go back and edit and

1876
01:22:42,961 --> 01:22:45,060
edit and edit.
It's not me really.

1877
01:22:45,240 --> 01:22:46,890
Yeah.
So when you write a song,

1878
01:22:46,891 --> 01:22:49,230
you write a song pretty much.
Wow,

1879
01:22:49,231 --> 01:22:50,900
that's interesting.
Does everybody do it that way?

1880
01:22:50,940 --> 01:22:51,380
No.
No,

1881
01:22:51,380 --> 01:22:52,213
not at all.
There.

1882
01:22:52,220 --> 01:22:55,140
There are guys who will take a whole
year to write one song really.

1883
01:22:55,380 --> 01:23:00,380
And I can't write with those guys.
I respect them but I don't have that

1884
01:23:01,531 --> 01:23:02,970
kind of patience.
I don't.

1885
01:23:02,971 --> 01:23:06,910
And they've written some songs that I
think are fantastic and I really do

1886
01:23:06,911 --> 01:23:07,391
appreciate it.
Um,

1887
01:23:07,391 --> 01:23:08,170
but I,
I,

1888
01:23:08,170 --> 01:23:11,380
I'm completely impatient.
Erotic songs.

1889
01:23:11,470 --> 01:23:13,810
I feel like,
you know,

1890
01:23:14,140 --> 01:23:18,400
my favorite songs are ones that just
kind of fall down out of the sky in a

1891
01:23:18,401 --> 01:23:21,310
bolt of lightening.
And you wrote it in about 10 minutes and

1892
01:23:21,311 --> 01:23:22,960
you're like,
that's exactly what it was supposed to

1893
01:23:22,961 --> 01:23:24,040
be.
Great.

1894
01:23:24,700 --> 01:23:26,920
I'm done.
I'm going to go eat a sandwich.

1895
01:23:28,770 --> 01:23:30,440
Right.
How much you should be,

1896
01:23:30,450 --> 01:23:31,950
right under the influence of something.

1897
01:23:32,520 --> 01:23:35,130
I don't like that really,
really to do that.

1898
01:23:35,180 --> 01:23:36,330
Nothing.
Well,

1899
01:23:36,331 --> 01:23:39,150
I mean I'm going to have a sip of
bourbon or something,

1900
01:23:39,151 --> 01:23:39,984
but,
you know,

1901
01:23:40,110 --> 01:23:42,360
it's,
I don't like that that much because I

1902
01:23:42,361 --> 01:23:44,080
like,
uh,

1903
01:23:44,120 --> 01:23:45,130
I like the clarity,
the,

1904
01:23:45,131 --> 01:23:46,110
there's a,
you know,

1905
01:23:48,630 --> 01:23:51,120
some guys can't do it without it.
And some guys,

1906
01:23:51,121 --> 01:23:53,430
it's,
it's like that makes them,

1907
01:23:54,270 --> 01:23:57,450
all of the sudden turned into the
Michael Jordan of songwriting,

1908
01:23:57,451 --> 01:23:58,560
you know,
but it just,

1909
01:23:58,900 --> 01:24:01,600
that's for me,
if I'm going to do something like that,

1910
01:24:01,610 --> 01:24:06,240
I,
it's recreational and I'm gonna go eat a

1911
01:24:06,241 --> 01:24:11,030
bunch of chips and watch a movie or
something like I'm not going to get.

1912
01:24:11,100 --> 01:24:12,870
I'm not going to get any real,
uh,

1913
01:24:14,010 --> 01:24:15,720
uh,
not much worthwhile.

1914
01:24:15,721 --> 01:24:16,830
It's going to come out of that for me.

1915
01:24:17,300 --> 01:24:19,160
Yeah.
That's interesting.

1916
01:24:19,161 --> 01:24:22,880
It's an interesting thing that people
have this different approach to

1917
01:24:23,300 --> 01:24:27,140
essentially w w what's an open ended
creative avenue,

1918
01:24:27,160 --> 01:24:29,060
you know,
like creating a song,

1919
01:24:29,070 --> 01:24:32,740
it's like a blank sheet of paper and
your,

1920
01:24:32,790 --> 01:24:36,320
your idea and so many different people
have different approaches to how to,

1921
01:24:36,410 --> 01:24:38,210
how to make that thing come out of their
head.

1922
01:24:38,570 --> 01:24:39,280
Yeah.
Well,

1923
01:24:39,280 --> 01:24:42,320
and I'm not saying that I haven't tried
many different ways,

1924
01:24:43,670 --> 01:24:48,670
but I find for me the process that
clarity works better than,

1925
01:24:49,340 --> 01:24:52,610
than,
than trying to alter myself to,

1926
01:24:52,700 --> 01:24:57,680
to get to some other plane,
but maybe there is another planet I

1927
01:24:57,681 --> 01:24:59,450
don't know about,
but I've never been there.

1928
01:25:00,070 --> 01:25:01,180
Right.
I would want,

1929
01:25:01,220 --> 01:25:02,860
like George Carlin had an interesting
way,

1930
01:25:02,861 --> 01:25:06,260
the real comedy who'd write comedy sober
and then he would smoke a joint,

1931
01:25:06,290 --> 01:25:07,990
punch it up.
Well,

1932
01:25:08,350 --> 01:25:10,960
yeah.
So he'd write the initial ideas.

1933
01:25:11,300 --> 01:25:14,430
You write it all out,
write out the bit that needed.

1934
01:25:16,130 --> 01:25:18,670
Okay.
Let's look at this thing again.

1935
01:25:20,450 --> 01:25:23,230
Well,
I mean I think that probably works in

1936
01:25:23,231 --> 01:25:23,890
comedy.
I,

1937
01:25:23,890 --> 01:25:24,660
yeah,
I've,

1938
01:25:24,660 --> 01:25:28,810
I've started adopting that.
I used to write almost all high and now

1939
01:25:28,811 --> 01:25:33,610
I write 50 percent high,
50 percent sober and then a punch up

1940
01:25:33,620 --> 01:25:35,620
high.
Okay.

1941
01:25:35,710 --> 01:25:39,250
Yeah.
But not to punch up as can be a term for

1942
01:25:39,251 --> 01:25:40,660
editing.
Yeah,

1943
01:25:40,661 --> 01:25:41,930
pretty much.
Um,

1944
01:25:42,550 --> 01:25:46,090
yeah.
It depends on some styles of writing.

1945
01:25:46,450 --> 01:25:49,480
Some guys right in bit form like they
say.

1946
01:25:49,481 --> 01:25:51,620
So the other day I walked in,
they would write it out like,

1947
01:25:52,060 --> 01:25:55,030
and other guys would just like say
clocks,

1948
01:25:55,480 --> 01:25:58,570
like the idea of clocks,
like the arbitrary decision that we all

1949
01:25:58,571 --> 01:26:00,130
made that there's,
you know,

1950
01:26:00,250 --> 01:26:04,610
these numbers around this dial,
this it's minute is this amount of time

1951
01:26:05,120 --> 01:26:07,760
and you'll just start writing all these
different things out of that.

1952
01:26:07,760 --> 01:26:09,670
You might write a whole essay out of
that.

1953
01:26:09,671 --> 01:26:11,570
You might have one paragraph that makes
sense,

1954
01:26:11,571 --> 01:26:15,470
like one quick one liner about time,
you know.

1955
01:26:15,530 --> 01:26:18,260
So maybe it's a,
an answer to a pretentious friend and

1956
01:26:18,290 --> 01:26:22,050
like there is new time and yeah,
well if you fucking show up late,

1957
01:26:22,080 --> 01:26:23,840
you get fired.
It's time for you get a new job.

1958
01:26:25,270 --> 01:26:29,370
That could be a way where you could take
time and you know,

1959
01:26:29,650 --> 01:26:34,550
just take like this big essay on it and
you would extract an idea that could

1960
01:26:34,551 --> 01:26:39,170
eventually be humor on stage,
but everybody's got a different style

1961
01:26:39,171 --> 01:26:40,100
that.
Yeah,

1962
01:26:40,250 --> 01:26:43,160
you know,
that's a lot of thinking.

1963
01:26:43,730 --> 01:26:45,740
Fuck man.
Because all a lot of thinking,

1964
01:26:45,741 --> 01:26:48,590
right?
That's why I always love talking to

1965
01:26:48,591 --> 01:26:50,240
people that do something completely
different than me.

1966
01:26:50,241 --> 01:26:52,180
Like you always want to know like,
okay,

1967
01:26:52,520 --> 01:26:54,920
how does a guy who writes books do this?

1968
01:26:55,190 --> 01:26:59,240
How does a guy who writes songs do this?
How does it guy who makes movies do

1969
01:26:59,241 --> 01:27:00,074
this?
Right.

1970
01:27:00,290 --> 01:27:01,820
You know,
because it seems like it's a lot of the

1971
01:27:01,821 --> 01:27:02,940
same muscles,
but the.

1972
01:27:03,030 --> 01:27:07,010
Then in talking here,
I'm not sure that the processes are

1973
01:27:07,011 --> 01:27:10,010
exactly.
I don't know that they always translate.

1974
01:27:10,850 --> 01:27:15,560
I think the focus is the same thing.
It's like your whatever your end goal

1975
01:27:15,561 --> 01:27:17,000
is,
whatever you're trying to create.

1976
01:27:17,030 --> 01:27:21,170
It's all about showing up and doing that
work and staring at it and trying to

1977
01:27:21,171 --> 01:27:23,030
figure it out.
And then for,

1978
01:27:23,380 --> 01:27:25,550
for comedy,
it's a lot about getting in front of the

1979
01:27:25,551 --> 01:27:27,530
crowds.
You gotta you gotTa work a lot.

1980
01:27:27,650 --> 01:27:29,390
If you don't work a lot,
it's not going to work,

1981
01:27:29,480 --> 01:27:32,000
just won't.
You have to be out there.

1982
01:27:32,240 --> 01:27:34,040
You can't just create comedy on your
own.

1983
01:27:34,041 --> 01:27:36,770
Whereas I think you with a bunch of
talented musicians,

1984
01:27:36,771 --> 01:27:40,400
you could probably developed a fucking
jam and record before anybody ever got a

1985
01:27:40,401 --> 01:27:43,030
chance to see it.
And that's what,

1986
01:27:43,110 --> 01:27:44,260
that's what you do.
Yeah.

1987
01:27:44,550 --> 01:27:46,250
Yeah.
It's clearly different style of

1988
01:27:46,251 --> 01:27:47,570
creation.
Although we did,

1989
01:27:47,580 --> 01:27:49,220
you know,
we do try things out on the road,

1990
01:27:49,320 --> 01:27:50,090
you know,
like,

1991
01:27:50,090 --> 01:27:52,850
and you kind of get a feel for them
sometimes that way.

1992
01:27:53,510 --> 01:27:54,170
So yeah,
we do,

1993
01:27:54,170 --> 01:27:56,330
we do some of that.
Absolutely.

1994
01:27:57,320 --> 01:27:59,690
But probably not as much as what you're
talking about.

1995
01:27:59,810 --> 01:28:01,400
Yeah,
I think it's a different art form.

1996
01:28:01,401 --> 01:28:03,320
Right.
Do you ever have,

1997
01:28:03,440 --> 01:28:07,730
do you ever do things specifically with
the intention of getting material out of

1998
01:28:07,731 --> 01:28:08,564
it?

1999
01:28:11,660 --> 01:28:12,920
Like,
like in life?

2000
01:28:13,380 --> 01:28:14,750
Yeah,
like go do something.

2001
01:28:14,751 --> 01:28:18,710
Like maybe if I go do this I'll,
I'll figure out,

2002
01:28:18,740 --> 01:28:20,300
I'll get some songs out of this or
something,

2003
01:28:20,440 --> 01:28:23,000
you know,
I don't know that I ever specifically do

2004
01:28:23,001 --> 01:28:27,560
something to get material out of it.
But I do do things because something

2005
01:28:27,561 --> 01:28:29,450
comes up and I go,
that sounds so weird.

2006
01:28:29,451 --> 01:28:31,850
I'm going to go do that.
And then from that,

2007
01:28:31,910 --> 01:28:35,950
and then from that,
either good things happen or I have a

2008
01:28:35,951 --> 01:28:40,540
story that sounds like it's fake.
That might be the best way to do it.

2009
01:28:40,541 --> 01:28:42,220
Right?
To just live a happy,

2010
01:28:42,221 --> 01:28:46,780
fulfilled life and mine that happy,
fulfilled life for ideas rather than

2011
01:28:47,020 --> 01:28:50,560
chase.
Interesting things with the specific

2012
01:28:50,561 --> 01:28:52,450
intention of turning them into
creativity.

2013
01:28:52,480 --> 01:28:52,890
Yeah.
No,

2014
01:28:52,890 --> 01:28:55,240
I don't think I ever do that,
but I definitely,

2015
01:28:55,740 --> 01:29:00,740
I go do things that might make me
uncomfortable or put myself in

2016
01:29:00,870 --> 01:29:02,040
situations where I'm like,
this sounds like

2017
01:29:02,040 --> 01:29:03,140
the weirdest thing.
I think what,

2018
01:29:03,390 --> 01:29:04,650
um,
what,

2019
01:29:04,680 --> 01:29:07,740
you know,
the case in point and that turned out to

2020
01:29:07,741 --> 01:29:08,281
be a,
you know,

2021
01:29:08,281 --> 01:29:10,430
we are now good friends.
But uh,

2022
01:29:10,530 --> 01:29:12,260
you know,
the first time I ever met Timberlake,

2023
01:29:12,990 --> 01:29:13,970
Justin timberlake.
Yeah.

2024
01:29:13,980 --> 01:29:18,030
I got a call to basically play at his
birthday party.

2025
01:29:18,031 --> 01:29:21,990
His wife called me
and this is no live,

2026
01:29:21,991 --> 01:29:25,260
like he'd seen a youtube video or
something and said,

2027
01:29:25,261 --> 01:29:26,220
hey,
would you come play?

2028
01:29:26,221 --> 01:29:29,500
And he thought I was getting punked or,
and I was just,

2029
01:29:29,610 --> 01:29:33,690
and I was just like,
and the conversation with his wife

2030
01:29:34,950 --> 01:29:36,270
Jessie was,
she was like,

2031
01:29:36,590 --> 01:29:37,423
yeah,
I'm a,

2032
01:29:37,960 --> 01:29:40,170
you know,
there's not a lot of things that he's

2033
01:29:40,171 --> 01:29:42,270
done a lot of things.
It's hard for me to find new experiences

2034
01:29:42,271 --> 01:29:44,370
for him.
And so I was wondering if you would like

2035
01:29:44,371 --> 01:29:47,220
to come play at his birthday party.
So I'm thinking and so this is what you

2036
01:29:47,221 --> 01:29:48,310
came up with,
you know,

2037
01:29:48,910 --> 01:29:52,020
this,
this realm duty saw a youtube video on

2038
01:29:52,080 --> 01:29:53,610
getting him to complete his birthday
party.

2039
01:29:54,270 --> 01:29:56,660
And it turned out to be fine and we hung
out a,

2040
01:29:56,890 --> 01:29:58,060
you know,
a,

2041
01:29:59,900 --> 01:30:02,200
and but it on paper,
it would to me,

2042
01:30:02,201 --> 01:30:03,950
it was just like,
this is really strange.

2043
01:30:03,951 --> 01:30:05,990
I don't know that this,
I don't know what's going to happen.

2044
01:30:06,260 --> 01:30:07,880
Right?
But out of that we,

2045
01:30:07,940 --> 01:30:11,700
we've become friends and you know,
done things together and,

2046
01:30:11,780 --> 01:30:13,910
and,
and good things have come out of it,

2047
01:30:13,930 --> 01:30:16,520
you know.
But there was no intent out of it other

2048
01:30:16,521 --> 01:30:19,730
than that than I thought it would be
interesting to go do.

2049
01:30:20,730 --> 01:30:24,320
And so I went and hung out and it turned
out to be great.

2050
01:30:24,380 --> 01:30:27,920
And we're good friends now and that's
pretty bad ass.

2051
01:30:27,980 --> 01:30:29,160
Yeah.
But that.

2052
01:30:29,180 --> 01:30:31,240
But that's how we met you to.
Yeah,

2053
01:30:31,280 --> 01:30:35,210
there we are.
And I was literally his birthday present

2054
01:30:35,211 --> 01:30:37,350
one year.
So that's wild man.

2055
01:30:37,370 --> 01:30:38,630
That's pretty cool.
Yeah,

2056
01:30:38,631 --> 01:30:43,631
I think that might be the formula.
Just if you can do things that you find

2057
01:30:44,451 --> 01:30:48,240
interesting and just have those as being
like

2058
01:30:51,250 --> 01:30:55,660
excellent a side side adventures in your
life.

2059
01:30:55,720 --> 01:30:56,051
Right.
And,

2060
01:30:56,051 --> 01:30:57,970
and you know,
nobody else has to understand it but

2061
01:30:57,971 --> 01:30:58,770
you.
And that's,

2062
01:30:58,770 --> 01:31:00,440
that's the cool part about it,
you know,

2063
01:31:00,790 --> 01:31:02,020
people used to get onto me,
you know,

2064
01:31:02,400 --> 01:31:03,730
I used to be able to grasp band and
they're like,

2065
01:31:03,731 --> 01:31:06,220
why are you spending time being a
bluegrass band?

2066
01:31:06,630 --> 01:31:07,980
Well,
out of being in that bluegrass band,

2067
01:31:07,990 --> 01:31:10,740
I got a cut on Adele,
right?

2068
01:31:10,760 --> 01:31:11,593
So

2069
01:31:12,880 --> 01:31:13,810
that,
that,

2070
01:31:13,870 --> 01:31:18,870
who would've thought that that was the
ex a plus b equals c formula for that.

2071
01:31:20,110 --> 01:31:24,370
They'll be in a bluegrass band and
you'll get a pop cut on the biggest pop

2072
01:31:24,371 --> 01:31:25,480
star wars.
Isn't that funny though,

2073
01:31:25,481 --> 01:31:26,590
that someone would say,
hey,

2074
01:31:26,591 --> 01:31:28,060
why do you want to be in a bluegrass
band?

2075
01:31:28,061 --> 01:31:28,751
Well,
they wouldn't say,

2076
01:31:28,751 --> 01:31:30,160
hey,
why do you like going fishing?

2077
01:31:32,120 --> 01:31:34,440
Yeah.
I don't know if you like it.

2078
01:31:34,530 --> 01:31:36,840
I like it.
Why do you like bowling?

2079
01:31:36,930 --> 01:31:38,070
Right.
It's interesting to me.

2080
01:31:38,071 --> 01:31:43,071
So I'm gonna I'm gonna Follow,
follow that road until it ends or takes

2081
01:31:43,411 --> 01:31:47,940
a curve or runs off a cliff.
Do you do anything specifically to try

2082
01:31:47,941 --> 01:31:50,100
to enrich your mind?
Do you read a lot or anything?

2083
01:31:50,490 --> 01:31:52,520
I'm not a huge reader.
I do play a lot of,

2084
01:31:52,620 --> 01:31:53,570
uh,
I just,

2085
01:31:53,610 --> 01:31:58,610
I just play it a lot of guitar.
I think that's my thing that I really

2086
01:31:59,110 --> 01:32:02,800
kind of internalize on a,
like almost like a meditation.

2087
01:32:02,801 --> 01:32:03,850
Yes,
absolutely.

2088
01:32:03,970 --> 01:32:07,360
If I'm,
if I'm feeling bad or in a bad head

2089
01:32:07,361 --> 01:32:09,430
space,
I'm going to pick up a guitar.

2090
01:32:09,440 --> 01:32:10,660
If I'm a,
you know,

2091
01:32:12,230 --> 01:32:14,080
that's what I do,
that,

2092
01:32:14,090 --> 01:32:16,940
that is,
that's if there's a centering thing,

2093
01:32:17,000 --> 01:32:22,000
I'm going to pick up a guitar to get
there for me and I don't know.

2094
01:32:23,900 --> 01:32:28,900
I don't know if that's mind
if that's flexing your mind a little

2095
01:32:29,031 --> 01:32:30,830
bit,
but it is something,

2096
01:32:30,831 --> 01:32:31,730
but I'll,
you know,

2097
01:32:33,030 --> 01:32:34,250
uh,
playing the guitars,

2098
01:32:34,280 --> 01:32:37,640
one of those things where you never
think that you're ever getting any

2099
01:32:37,641 --> 01:32:42,440
better at it until one day you wake up
and you understand something that you

2100
01:32:42,441 --> 01:32:46,010
didn't understand and hadn't understood
for the 10 years you've been trying to

2101
01:32:46,011 --> 01:32:49,070
understand it and then all of a sudden
you have this new,

2102
01:32:50,620 --> 01:32:53,710
you know,
new space to live in on it and then

2103
01:32:53,711 --> 01:32:55,510
it's.
And it's the coolest thing in the world

2104
01:32:55,511 --> 01:32:56,740
to me,
Whoa,

2105
01:32:57,370 --> 01:32:59,320
I know what you're saying,
but I don't know if

2106
01:33:00,850 --> 01:33:03,120
you hit a new level,
like,

2107
01:33:03,190 --> 01:33:05,650
like you're working out and you're
working out and you're working on your

2108
01:33:05,651 --> 01:33:10,150
workout for 10 years and you never get.
You hit this point where like,

2109
01:33:10,170 --> 01:33:12,130
alright,
this is the peak of what I have.

2110
01:33:12,550 --> 01:33:16,030
And then some day for some unknown
reason,

2111
01:33:16,480 --> 01:33:19,330
your body or something,
it makes sense and all of a sudden you

2112
01:33:19,331 --> 01:33:20,740
could do something that you could never
do before.

2113
01:33:21,850 --> 01:33:23,530
And that's,
that's what planning guitar is.

2114
01:33:25,360 --> 01:33:29,890
Do I kind of understand the space you're
talking about and I think that applies

2115
01:33:29,891 --> 01:33:32,100
to a lot of different things,
you know?

2116
01:33:32,101 --> 01:33:35,530
Um,
is this moving me Animoto Musashi quote

2117
01:33:35,531 --> 01:33:40,000
that I like I use all the time.
Once you understand the way broadly you

2118
01:33:40,001 --> 01:33:42,640
see it in all things and that,
this,

2119
01:33:42,730 --> 01:33:46,420
this place that you're talking about,
like these new level places like that

2120
01:33:46,421 --> 01:33:49,880
exists in martial arts.
It exists in comedy.

2121
01:33:49,881 --> 01:33:53,650
It exists in writing and exists and I'm
sure it exists in music,

2122
01:33:53,651 --> 01:33:58,651
although I don't do music.
I think this thing of this Zen Samurai

2123
01:33:59,201 --> 01:34:03,040
thing you're talking about of just like
this constant focus until you reach some

2124
01:34:03,041 --> 01:34:06,430
new understanding of the thing and you
don't even know how you're getting there

2125
01:34:06,460 --> 01:34:07,330
but,
but you're,

2126
01:34:08,040 --> 01:34:11,590
but you're working towards something but
you don't know what it is until you get

2127
01:34:11,591 --> 01:34:12,670
there.
Yeah.

2128
01:34:12,671 --> 01:34:17,620
And then you get it and you have this
new piece of knowledge or it's a piece

2129
01:34:17,621 --> 01:34:20,920
of and it's a new.
All of a sudden you're selling something

2130
01:34:20,921 --> 01:34:23,080
new too.
And maybe that's the thing you were

2131
01:34:23,081 --> 01:34:26,410
talking about earlier about people who
suck accommodate.

2132
01:34:26,620 --> 01:34:28,510
All of a sudden they're,
you know,

2133
01:34:28,970 --> 01:34:30,930
like that's,
you know,

2134
01:34:32,420 --> 01:34:37,160
that's what I get off on is finding a,
finding that,

2135
01:34:38,120 --> 01:34:38,953
you know,
and,

2136
01:34:39,010 --> 01:34:41,090
and,
and I don't claim to be,

2137
01:34:41,150 --> 01:34:41,983
you know,
I'm not like

2138
01:34:43,460 --> 01:34:44,920
I don't belong in,
you know,

2139
01:34:44,960 --> 01:34:46,430
Gary Clark junior world or anything like
that,

2140
01:34:46,431 --> 01:34:51,431
but I do love guitar enough to know that
I'm always playing enough to try to find

2141
01:34:54,201 --> 01:34:57,800
that new space to live and that's the
coolest thing the world to me because

2142
01:34:58,020 --> 01:35:01,610
I'll never get to whatever.
There's never an end to it.

2143
01:35:01,720 --> 01:35:02,750
Right,
right.

2144
01:35:02,990 --> 01:35:04,280
Yeah.
There's no perfection.

2145
01:35:04,310 --> 01:35:05,840
There's no perfection.
There's no,

2146
01:35:06,580 --> 01:35:08,710
um,
there's never an end to it.

2147
01:35:08,711 --> 01:35:13,040
It's just a constantly trying to get
better at doing what you do or being,

2148
01:35:13,100 --> 01:35:15,380
being used that trying to make yourself
better.

2149
01:35:16,790 --> 01:35:19,580
And that thing seems to manifest itself
more with,

2150
01:35:19,610 --> 01:35:21,320
with a singular focus like

2151
01:35:21,350 --> 01:35:22,760
guitar.
Yeah.

2152
01:35:22,940 --> 01:35:26,060
Oh yeah.
You have to be like way obsessed with

2153
01:35:26,061 --> 01:35:28,540
one thing
and that.

2154
01:35:28,730 --> 01:35:30,410
And that's it for me for the most part.

2155
01:35:31,520 --> 01:35:33,350
Kristan button.
You're a bad motherfucker.

2156
01:35:33,440 --> 01:35:34,640
Thank you for coming on the show,
man.

2157
01:35:34,641 --> 01:35:35,620
I really appreciate it,
man.

2158
01:35:35,780 --> 01:35:37,640
I've been a been a real joy.
It's a real honor,

2159
01:35:37,641 --> 01:35:38,474
man.
Thank you.

2160
01:35:39,290 --> 01:35:41,240
Go Buy Shit folks.
It's fucking awesome.

2161
01:35:41,480 --> 01:35:42,470
All right,
we'll see you tomorrow.

2162
01:35:42,530 --> 01:35:42,920
Bye.
