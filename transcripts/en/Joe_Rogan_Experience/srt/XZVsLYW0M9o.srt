00:00:01,050 --> 00:00:03,480
Hello.
Hey everybody.

2
00:00:03,690 --> 00:00:07,350
The Joe Rogan experience
podcast is brought to you by
[inaudible] dot com that's

3
00:00:07,380 --> 00:00:12,000
o, n n I t, makers of Alpha
brain, which I'm on now.

4
00:00:12,870 --> 00:00:17,520
Brian, are you on it? I'm on new mid
on it, bitch. Get on it. I ran out.

5
00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:20,730
You bet you take the new mood because
you liked to party. You're 34.

6
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:23,900
No, it's just helps me at night. Serotonin

7
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:27,230
son. That's, that's what it
is. It really doesn't it?

8
00:00:27,410 --> 00:00:31,130
When you do all that crazy shit you oh
yeah. Yeah. I didn't do it all the time.

9
00:00:31,170 --> 00:00:35,660
It's like a junkie on the street. You,
I did it once the other day. Oh, okay.

10
00:00:35,810 --> 00:00:39,950
Once the other day. Keep it together,
son. Um, yeah. What new mood is, is a,

11
00:00:39,951 --> 00:00:44,000
it's five HTP and l trip to fan and
apparently the way the body breaks down

12
00:00:44,001 --> 00:00:46,820
certain, it's all described on, on a.com.

13
00:00:46,850 --> 00:00:51,850
But before I do my butcher job of
scientifically hacking through my limited

14
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:53,610
inflammation,
um,

15
00:00:54,230 --> 00:00:59,230
five HTP is something that it allows your
brain to produce more serotonin and l

16
00:01:02,660 --> 00:01:06,800
trip to fan converts to five HTP.
You're doing it with whiskey.

17
00:01:06,801 --> 00:01:10,240
This is a perfect chase. Right? It
is the perfect that is, that is it.

18
00:01:10,890 --> 00:01:14,640
You might imagine if that would
make you so drunk, happy Madge.

19
00:01:14,650 --> 00:01:19,650
If it turned out that was like a
happy drunk and I'm fine with that.

20
00:01:19,970 --> 00:01:24,140
I love happy drunks. Happy drunks are
really rare. I'm finding out. So knowing.

21
00:01:24,141 --> 00:01:27,770
Yeah, it's super rare. So knowing people
that don't know how to handle their shit,

22
00:01:28,900 --> 00:01:33,900
dirty freaks anyway on it.com
oh and n I t shroom tech sport.

23
00:01:34,791 --> 00:01:38,620
That's what you needed to get on Sun man.
You need to start working out,

24
00:01:38,670 --> 00:01:42,730
get your body in order kid, get your
heart pumping and I want you to die. Yeah.

25
00:01:43,180 --> 00:01:46,700
You get, you listen, you need to make
it work or it's going to give out quick.

26
00:01:47,190 --> 00:01:51,560
Yeah. I mean I I consider like I do
workouts but the disguised as work, like,

27
00:01:51,561 --> 00:01:55,050
like going through the airport
with a studio the other day.

28
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:57,780
Like I still a workout. Yeah. I had
a boss who is kind, Kinda, yeah.

29
00:01:57,781 --> 00:02:00,390
I had a box that weighed
probably 50 pounds.

30
00:02:00,391 --> 00:02:04,500
I had a book bag that weighed probably
80 pounds and then I had a sore the next

31
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:07,140
day. I'm so sore right now. I
have my whole body feels fun.

32
00:02:08,820 --> 00:02:12,060
But that was kind of like, let's
see, I disguise workouts like that or

33
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:15,230
take shroom tech sport before you go to
the airport. Then yeah, you should do it.

34
00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:20,070
Help you for rails to cordyceps
mushrooms and beat 12. And it's a,

35
00:02:20,170 --> 00:02:23,080
if anybody, do you ever
exercise? Occasionally. Yeah.

36
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:26,710
I've got to get you on some true shroom
tech sport. It's quarter steps, mushrooms,

37
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:27,730
it's fascinating stuff.

38
00:02:27,730 --> 00:02:31,480
And on a.com also has kettle
bells and battle ropes in Joe.

39
00:02:31,481 --> 00:02:35,760
What does a Kettlebell and what's a
battle rope? Some manly shit, son battle.

40
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:39,260
So this manly shit,
it's um,

41
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:42,730
battle ropes are fascinating.
They're giant long ropes,

42
00:02:42,731 --> 00:02:46,690
like 40 feet long and you whip them
through the air and as you, uh,

43
00:02:46,691 --> 00:02:48,280
you're whipping them
through the air there.

44
00:02:48,340 --> 00:02:52,860
It's like incredible endurance exercise.
Incredible for your grandpa.

45
00:02:52,861 --> 00:02:56,360
It's great for like muscular endurance.
It's a really crazy exercise.

46
00:02:56,380 --> 00:02:57,370
Very hard to do.

47
00:02:57,490 --> 00:03:02,490
And kettle bells of probably the single
piece of athletic equipment as the meow

48
00:03:04,121 --> 00:03:07,570
in the background goes off.
Yeah. That, that I know of.

49
00:03:08,230 --> 00:03:09,400
I think for functional strength,

50
00:03:09,401 --> 00:03:11,470
that's probably the one of
the best things you can do.

51
00:03:11,650 --> 00:03:14,470
It forces you to use your
whole body as one unit.

52
00:03:14,471 --> 00:03:18,400
There's a fuck load of exercises that
are all available online. You can, like,

53
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:21,820
there's a lot of youtube videos and shit
and this is a lot of different programs

54
00:03:21,821 --> 00:03:23,110
that people have up for free.

55
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:25,990
But if you want something
that's gonna increase your,

56
00:03:26,020 --> 00:03:28,570
your athletic performance
and functional strength,

57
00:03:28,810 --> 00:03:31,510
I could think of nothing better than
kettlebells. It's like, it's, for me,

58
00:03:31,511 --> 00:03:35,350
it's like the best exercise I've ever
done for just for, for getting strong,

59
00:03:35,351 --> 00:03:38,080
physically strong. So go
check it out. Uh, these,

60
00:03:38,081 --> 00:03:40,960
these kettlebells are as cheap
as we can fucking sell them.

61
00:03:41,230 --> 00:03:45,580
It's really hard to do this because
you're essentially sending cannon balls

62
00:03:45,581 --> 00:03:48,460
through the mail
and that's what they are,

63
00:03:48,461 --> 00:03:53,270
the giant cannon balls with handles on it.
So, uh, they like an old timey exercise.

64
00:03:53,610 --> 00:03:58,240
Super Old Timey, black snakes.
Well, those old strong men dudes,

65
00:03:58,241 --> 00:04:02,200
they that that was, that's like real
functional strength when those got,

66
00:04:02,201 --> 00:04:04,500
you see those guys in those giant clubs,
you know,

67
00:04:04,510 --> 00:04:06,490
they would like carry like a mace.

68
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:10,540
It was like a giant pole and at the end
of it was like a huge cannon ball and

69
00:04:10,541 --> 00:04:13,900
they'd be wielding this and
you know this unwieldy object.

70
00:04:14,260 --> 00:04:17,080
It's like great for strength
and all that old stuff.

71
00:04:17,081 --> 00:04:19,750
Like it's like that's way better
than like a universal machine.

72
00:04:19,751 --> 00:04:22,060
You know those machines, it
just kind of like just, hey,

73
00:04:22,070 --> 00:04:24,520
you don't find yourself doing
that very well. Even if you do,

74
00:04:24,521 --> 00:04:28,210
it doesn't really work that way the way
you're is. You're not balancing anything.

75
00:04:28,211 --> 00:04:29,850
You're just pushing a machine.
It can be,

76
00:04:29,851 --> 00:04:32,830
you could be pushing more with the
right than the left and barely can tell.

77
00:04:32,830 --> 00:04:35,710
It's not, you know what I mean?
It's not the same thing when you're,

78
00:04:35,711 --> 00:04:38,020
when you have to do,
like if you're going to do a bench press,

79
00:04:38,030 --> 00:04:39,860
you just do bench press.
With a freeway like this,

80
00:04:39,940 --> 00:04:43,150
there's a lot of athletic benefit
in having to balance things out.

81
00:04:43,390 --> 00:04:47,770
That's negated when you have like the
super mechanical thing that doesn't vary

82
00:04:47,771 --> 00:04:50,050
at all.
Brandon Miguel Roy's dinner,

83
00:04:52,010 --> 00:04:55,240
that savage, so this is a,
there's a bunch of different,

84
00:04:55,241 --> 00:04:59,190
this is a on on its website
we have a bunch of uh,

85
00:04:59,590 --> 00:05:03,700
have we talked to an exercises that
show, uh, just basics of kettlebells,

86
00:05:03,820 --> 00:05:05,980
how to carry out, how
to do it safely. And,

87
00:05:05,990 --> 00:05:09,190
and the most important thing is to
understand that this is not like any other

88
00:05:09,191 --> 00:05:12,490
exercise. Everything is
usually about, you know, like,

89
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:17,890
like controlled movements like
curls or shoulder presses.

90
00:05:17,891 --> 00:05:19,510
Like that's how people
think of exercising.

91
00:05:19,780 --> 00:05:24,780
But with kettlebells you go through
like long series of motions and you do

92
00:05:25,030 --> 00:05:28,450
basically with your whole body,
things like Turkish getups,

93
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:31,570
you lie on your back with his big fucking
cannon ball and then you straighten

94
00:05:31,571 --> 00:05:35,590
your arm up and then you slowly get up
and he stand up like that and then you go

95
00:05:35,591 --> 00:05:37,510
back down,
back to the same thing,

96
00:05:37,511 --> 00:05:41,490
lie on your back and push up this giant
cannonball. Oh yeah, it's awesome.

97
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:45,790
Me Put them in a bowling bag or ball bag.
That sounds dangerous.

98
00:05:46,780 --> 00:05:50,020
It seems like they would probably think
you're suspicious when you're dealing

99
00:05:50,021 --> 00:05:54,840
with a cannonball, sir. Oh Man.
This is a Kettlebell when I,

100
00:05:54,841 --> 00:05:57,920
it's an ancient Russian form
of athletic enhancement.

101
00:05:58,100 --> 00:06:02,270
Did we talk about how there's gut, you're
making a bunch of ups drivers workout

102
00:06:02,540 --> 00:06:07,310
without knowing for ups drivers, calves.

103
00:06:07,380 --> 00:06:10,540
I'm sorry, which I've noticed these
fucking things though. I'm telling you,

104
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:11,140
look,

105
00:06:11,140 --> 00:06:14,920
if you order these kettlebells are the
best quality kettlebells we could find

106
00:06:15,260 --> 00:06:16,450
the perfect.

107
00:06:16,451 --> 00:06:20,470
They're exactly what you want and were
heavy as shit and they will never break.

108
00:06:20,471 --> 00:06:22,630
These fucking things
will be there when they,

109
00:06:22,660 --> 00:06:25,720
when they find the American civilization,
5,000 years from now,

110
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:28,540
some future scientists on hovercrafts,

111
00:06:29,170 --> 00:06:31,840
they'll find these crazy fucking
cannon balls with handles on. I'm like,

112
00:06:31,870 --> 00:06:33,680
what the fuck?
What are these crazy bitches up to?

113
00:06:34,190 --> 00:06:36,730
That's how long those kettle bells
of you're working it out. Yeah.

114
00:06:36,790 --> 00:06:40,300
It's proof that pick but big foot
existed too. Don't get squashy.

115
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:45,240
All right ladies, gentlemen, honey, honey

126
00:07:17,780 --> 00:07:21,150
He says that as a trip to fan.
That does, yeah, he moved. Yeah.

127
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:24,260
Doesn't that put you to sleep?
That's what I heard a trip to fan.

128
00:07:24,261 --> 00:07:27,200
I think it's a real accent. Um, I don't
think it puts you street mountain,

129
00:07:27,201 --> 00:07:29,870
but they think Melatonin puts you sleep.
I think that's actually a myth.

130
00:07:30,380 --> 00:07:33,650
It's a myth that trip to fan put you
asleep. I believe that most people,

131
00:07:33,651 --> 00:07:38,090
it's just overeating and we associate
it with the Turkey because thanksgiving,

132
00:07:38,091 --> 00:07:40,680
it's the one day like you
purposely ovary like everyone.

133
00:07:40,690 --> 00:07:43,550
Delicious smell of the year. Yeah, you
go fucking crazy. You completely overeat.

134
00:07:43,900 --> 00:07:47,780
Ooh. It has Valerian root, which is also
a sleep aid, but then crystal meth would,

135
00:07:48,130 --> 00:07:52,830
what sound, she's
fucking crazy. All right.

136
00:07:52,870 --> 00:07:55,560
Start it Brian. Let's get
this fucking bitch. Rolan

137
00:08:00,570 --> 00:08:05,020
experience. Try my day.
Joe Rogan podcast all day.

138
00:08:06,750 --> 00:08:09,400
[inaudible]

139
00:08:09,790 --> 00:08:14,790
my friends, my friend. Good

very much looking forward to it.

141
00:08:18,910 --> 00:08:22,300
I really enjoyed a senior guys
on stage and Coachella from,

142
00:08:22,330 --> 00:08:23,230
I've watched it online.

143
00:08:23,260 --> 00:08:26,230
You did? Yeah. That's
awesome. It was awesome

144
00:08:27,210 --> 00:08:30,840
line. It was fucking cool. First of
all, that's a really cool feature.

145
00:08:31,020 --> 00:08:32,790
They had all the different stages,

146
00:08:32,791 --> 00:08:35,760
like everything you could watch it all
go down online and I was like, wow,

147
00:08:35,761 --> 00:08:39,450
that's uh, that's amazing. I think it's
the first year they did that to this.

148
00:08:39,490 --> 00:08:42,210
They're, they're changing their
sit up like crazy. It's amazing.

149
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:46,510
But when you said that you used to
work there selling hot will selling

150
00:08:46,770 --> 00:08:47,850
I W I was working there.

151
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:51,870
I'm southern Barbecue Selling Barbara
Baby Blues barbeque. Yeah, it was crazy.

152
00:08:51,871 --> 00:08:56,070
I went just to go to the
festival. Um, but I, I

153
00:08:56,070 --> 00:08:59,160
got 100 bucks for the weekend
to work and then, you know,

154
00:08:59,220 --> 00:09:02,280
I stopped by Muranga on the
way to double it, triple it,

155
00:09:02,340 --> 00:09:06,420
and then I hung out at the festival
and sold, you know, beef brisket.

156
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:07,673
Wow.

157
00:09:08,150 --> 00:09:11,660
That's hilarious. It was cool.
And then here you were on stage.

158
00:09:11,661 --> 00:09:14,480
That was like a scene in a
movie that's like finding,

159
00:09:14,510 --> 00:09:16,250
that's like a cool scene in a movie.

160
00:09:16,460 --> 00:09:19,160
Like when things start to
really boom for your career,

161
00:09:19,340 --> 00:09:21,380
you get to say something
like that on stage.

162
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:24,790
It, you know, it was, it was intense.

163
00:09:24,820 --> 00:09:27,920
It was definitely like
incredibly overwhelming in a,

164
00:09:27,921 --> 00:09:31,720
in a positive and exciting way because
you get there and it's just fucking huge.

165
00:09:31,721 --> 00:09:32,960
Like,
like the,

166
00:09:33,170 --> 00:09:37,060
and one of the coolest parts I think about
Coachella was that the backstage area

167
00:09:37,061 --> 00:09:41,650
where all the artists hang out, like the
artist's camp, um, was open to everybody.

168
00:09:41,651 --> 00:09:42,431
It wasn't,
you know,

169
00:09:42,431 --> 00:09:45,500
it's like the sort of like newer
bands such as ourselves over here.

170
00:09:45,501 --> 00:09:48,400
It was like everybody was
walking around like Holy Shit,

171
00:09:48,401 --> 00:09:50,110
there's Radiohead and there's,

172
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:54,560
there's Dr Dre and a shit
load of weed and everybody,

173
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:57,550
everybody. It was so, that was
really cool to just be like,

174
00:09:57,960 --> 00:10:01,720
er amongst these people and feel like
you belong there. You know it was,

175
00:10:01,780 --> 00:10:02,570
it was rad.

176
00:10:02,570 --> 00:10:05,060
It was cool.
I met ice cube once he knew my name.

177
00:10:05,780 --> 00:10:10,440
Of course he did. He knows
my, it's like what up Joe?

178
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:14,340
Oh today was a very good day.
Yeah.

179
00:10:15,290 --> 00:10:19,210
Every time I think of ice cube and ice
tea, I think about that youtube or that,

180
00:10:19,250 --> 00:10:22,940
that photograph, you know of like the
pop machine or soda machine if you will,

181
00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:24,790
that has like Coca Cola.
Right.

182
00:10:24,830 --> 00:10:28,430
And there's a picture of ice teas face
over the ice tea and then ice cube over

183
00:10:28,431 --> 00:10:32,790
the ice cream. It's so great. Sorry.
Just so literal. Yeah. How much

184
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:36,160
she's still trip out, like running into
like really famous people like that.

185
00:10:36,161 --> 00:10:39,130
And you're like, you will work working
with them. What does it, is it,

186
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:40,270
is it a mind fuck?

187
00:10:40,271 --> 00:10:43,330
Like what's what's cause it's just
starting to happen for you guys.

188
00:10:43,331 --> 00:10:45,160
You guys are on tour with
Sheryl Crow right now. Right.

189
00:10:46,030 --> 00:10:50,070
Ben quit like the fact that she
knows our band's name right.

190
00:10:50,090 --> 00:10:53,870
The mind blowing apart and then
she uses her time on stage.

191
00:10:53,871 --> 00:10:55,250
She's been talking about us for like,

192
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:59,450
she'll give like these honey honey
speeches. Oh, it was amazing. I teared up,

193
00:10:59,451 --> 00:11:02,700
I swear to God. Holy
Shit. She's a, you know,

194
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:05,270
she's one of the first people
we've toured with that like, I,

195
00:11:05,271 --> 00:11:09,380
I mean I used to listen to her when I
was a kid and I kind of worship her a

196
00:11:09,381 --> 00:11:12,860
little bit. I mean, she's, she's a
bad ass and she's, she, first of all,

197
00:11:12,861 --> 00:11:16,280
she plays for like two hours in every
song is a hit. Yeah. Every song.

198
00:11:16,850 --> 00:11:21,050
Jesus Christ and, and um, to be, you know,

199
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:23,810
so amazingly generous to us.

200
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:28,710
Really humbling and just like, it's,
it's pretty crazy. I had a, uh,

201
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:32,770
a friend of mine's girlfriend question
whether or not I was joking that I was

202
00:11:32,771 --> 00:11:36,250
really low like that.
It was a CD in my car and I was offended.

203
00:11:36,870 --> 00:11:39,760
[inaudible] it's like, how could you not
like Sheryl Crow? She's fucking awesome.

204
00:11:39,970 --> 00:11:42,820
She's fucking incredible lyrics.
Like all the,

205
00:11:42,821 --> 00:11:47,410
you don't really have that CD by it.
Then you were like,

206
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:53,000
no, seriously get out. How
are you fart in my space up,

207
00:11:53,010 --> 00:11:53,843
dare you.

208
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:59,020
Oh my God, you guys, that's
going to be so trippy.

209
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:01,990
You're in like that really
cool stage of the movie.

210
00:12:03,020 --> 00:12:07,210
That's really cool stage honestly to
be honest with you. Like seriously,

211
00:12:07,270 --> 00:12:09,300
like we've toured for years now and like,

212
00:12:09,301 --> 00:12:11,740
and no disrespect to the other people
we've toured with because they've been

213
00:12:11,741 --> 00:12:15,340
incredible. But like from my
childhood, like listening to her,

214
00:12:15,341 --> 00:12:19,090
I remember like lists like driving in the
car with my mother and like making her

215
00:12:19,180 --> 00:12:22,450
harmonize with me for the show crow songs.
I'm like, no mom, you, I take the top,

216
00:12:22,451 --> 00:12:25,240
you take the bottom. Then we,
we've come on and I'm just like,

217
00:12:25,241 --> 00:12:26,470
do it again and do it again.

218
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:31,800
And just to watch her perform like right
in front of me and then to say to say

219
00:12:32,051 --> 00:12:35,140
like, Oh, you know, you guys really need
to, we need to talk about honey honey.

220
00:12:35,140 --> 00:12:39,610
And she really gave us the time up
there. Like I fucking freaked out. I was,

221
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:41,830
I was emotional about it.
It was really cool.

222
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:46,600
And you see it as a real person too.
I mean, I don't, she's very tiny,

223
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:50,020
small or in your pocket,
but it's not like this,

224
00:12:50,170 --> 00:12:52,780
this product or anything like that.
You have the CD in your car,

225
00:12:52,781 --> 00:12:55,990
you have a download or a video and
it's all these like representations.

226
00:12:55,991 --> 00:13:00,400
But then she's right there, you know? And
she just saw her once at a Baja fresh.

227
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:04,420
Really? She was in line at the Baja
for awesome. I was like, Oh shit.

228
00:13:04,450 --> 00:13:07,410
That's Sheryl Crow Burritos.
I didn't say anything though.

229
00:13:07,420 --> 00:13:10,840
Most of us kept on paying
attention to what she ordered.

230
00:13:13,060 --> 00:13:14,500
I remember to this day,

231
00:13:20,060 --> 00:13:24,030
how many people would do that?
Me? Just kidding. Sort of money,

232
00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:27,430
creepy people and would steal
her food. Ooh, just wrap it up.

233
00:13:27,710 --> 00:13:31,720
Pull it out of the trash. Zip Lock
it. Yeah. Well that's like, not,

234
00:13:31,810 --> 00:13:33,010
not to be disgusting,
but you know,

235
00:13:33,011 --> 00:13:35,760
they talk about like the seventies
stories where like, you know,

236
00:13:35,950 --> 00:13:40,060
groupies like steel condoms from like
Mick Jagger Zam and tries disgusting.

237
00:13:40,930 --> 00:13:43,410
Brought that up. There's, you know,

238
00:13:43,930 --> 00:13:46,660
I think it's not as rock and
roll anymore as it used to be.

239
00:13:47,620 --> 00:13:51,370
The Rock and roll life is not as rock
and roll to Twitter. Ruin it. No, I mean,

240
00:13:51,371 --> 00:13:53,770
I think there's just like safety
issues. It's like, you know,

241
00:13:53,771 --> 00:13:58,510
don't go in the trash fishing for use
condoms. It's probably not a good move

242
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:04,690
that we've have all teacher, you
know, we figured out the fire.

243
00:14:04,750 --> 00:14:09,530
I'm really sorry I don't do that.
Yeah,

244
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:14,620
don't, don't go doing that.
No, but seriously, I think
that like you can't, you know,

245
00:14:14,621 --> 00:14:19,090
back in the day it was like, you know, I
don't know Metallica or somebody, whoever,

246
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:20,800
you know,
rage against the machine.

247
00:14:20,830 --> 00:14:25,030
I shouldn't name names cause I don't want
to misquote anyone. But like, you know,

248
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:30,120
bigger bands would just trash a hotel
room or like the 80s it was end of the

249
00:14:32,261 --> 00:14:35,470
job. You're not really saying those get
bands cause I don't know if any of those,

250
00:14:35,471 --> 00:14:40,010
no, I don't. And I love those man. So
I shut my mouth. I was just looking.

251
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:44,190
I know I've done that. You've
trusted for example, and you go, uh,

252
00:14:45,940 --> 00:14:50,560
but, but nowadays, if you disrespect
establishments in venues like that,

253
00:14:50,830 --> 00:14:52,130
people don't want to have you back.

254
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:54,860
Even if you sell it out, it's
like you're, you know, you're the,

255
00:14:54,940 --> 00:14:59,210
there's like a sort of a new
wave of, of sort of, you know,

256
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:02,660
everybody went to Rehab and then they
came back and they realize that you need

257
00:15:02,661 --> 00:15:05,240
to be respectful and you know,
people are working.

258
00:15:05,310 --> 00:15:09,890
That's why Joshua Volta can't get
massages at some jewelry. That's why.

259
00:15:09,891 --> 00:15:11,800
That's exactly why they were like,
dude,

260
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,070
stop trying to fuck my staff.

261
00:15:20,090 --> 00:15:23,750
Oh Man. Well that's what happens
to me. No, I'm just kidding.

262
00:15:24,540 --> 00:15:29,320
We'll fucking your staff. No, they
don't let me end to get a massage.

263
00:15:29,750 --> 00:15:31,850
Yeah, you can't be trash. And
People's hotel rooms, right.

264
00:15:31,851 --> 00:15:35,300
That's fucking rude is shit.
I don't know.

265
00:15:35,301 --> 00:15:38,390
Drew to everyone else's stay in the
hotel too. They're all going to hear that

266
00:15:41,060 --> 00:15:43,620
on the table, but that's about it.
That's one of the different one.

267
00:15:43,621 --> 00:15:46,020
It's like a motel six. That's
true. Like what are we going to do?

268
00:15:48,260 --> 00:15:52,150
Motel six by by default.
How'd you do that? Well, um,

269
00:15:52,510 --> 00:15:55,880
we had a Gig for the 4th of July
in Pagosa Springs, Colorado,

270
00:15:55,881 --> 00:16:00,170
which was incredibly, you know,
just a great time. Is that near?

271
00:16:00,470 --> 00:16:05,030
It's like four hours south of Denver.
Wow. Yeah, a relaxing spa town.

272
00:16:09,180 --> 00:16:13,580
So it smells everywhere.
Solferino like, yes, very much so.

273
00:16:13,610 --> 00:16:17,500
It's very stinky, but apparently
it's like minerals, but it's like,

274
00:16:17,510 --> 00:16:21,440
it's so good for you. Yeah, it's, it's
pretty, it's funny. I, my, my buddies,

275
00:16:21,441 --> 00:16:25,400
I'm staying with my friend Dave. I was
Dave, if you're watching this is hey Dave,

276
00:16:25,730 --> 00:16:26,990
um,
he,

277
00:16:27,110 --> 00:16:31,640
his toilet had this like backup thing
last night and it smelled horrible,

278
00:16:31,641 --> 00:16:34,650
but I was like, oh, that's,
that also smells like the
hot springs from is healing,

279
00:16:34,990 --> 00:16:39,440
healing. And then I, I
made, I'm just kidding.

280
00:16:39,870 --> 00:16:44,840
Um, but anyway, on our way back from
this 4th of July Gig, um, we were,

281
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:48,710
uh, we were somewhere and actually we
were in a town called Mexican waters,

282
00:16:48,711 --> 00:16:52,460
Arizona and we were at this gas
station. Yes. And the Navajo nation.

283
00:16:53,060 --> 00:16:55,340
And in the middle of number work,
do you have to go through there?

284
00:16:55,341 --> 00:16:57,890
Do you have to show id to go
through the Navajo nation?

285
00:16:58,370 --> 00:17:01,730
Just drive through and you're good to go.
They want you to move there though.

286
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:05,450
That's what I was figuring out. How does
that work? Look on reservations. You know,

287
00:17:05,451 --> 00:17:08,760
can you just, you could just drive in.
We just went straight through. Yeah. Hmm.

288
00:17:09,050 --> 00:17:09,883
Bought some jewelry,

289
00:17:10,130 --> 00:17:13,640
kept growing and they were allowed to
have totally different laws there, right?

290
00:17:14,310 --> 00:17:16,180
I believe so. Yes. On reservoir.

291
00:17:17,150 --> 00:17:21,780
All I know as far as my, um, my
experience with, with that sort of thing,

292
00:17:21,820 --> 00:17:24,260
it has to do with casinos and yes,
they have their own law.

293
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:26,780
They have their own drone
law as far as that. Right.

294
00:17:26,870 --> 00:17:29,600
If someone calls the cops on you and
you're within the reservation of,

295
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:33,950
or that territory, they have their own,
their own law or their own police force.

296
00:17:34,870 --> 00:17:38,570
Yeah. That's kind of a fascinating
trip, isn't it? Yeah. It's interesting.

297
00:17:38,910 --> 00:17:42,950
Dover remanence of genocide essentially.
But I think that if there's, if there's,

298
00:17:43,010 --> 00:17:44,140
if there's a,
um,

299
00:17:45,110 --> 00:17:48,530
there's some sort of situation
that needs to go to a higher level,

300
00:17:48,531 --> 00:17:49,560
then it's a federal

301
00:17:50,670 --> 00:17:53,070
case and then it's so intense.

302
00:17:53,100 --> 00:17:57,090
That's why I just try to mind my p's
and q's when I'm going through a Indian

303
00:17:57,091 --> 00:17:58,930
reservations. It's fascinating
though, isn't it? I mean,

304
00:17:58,931 --> 00:18:02,790
it's almost like the radar that
it was all stolen, so I can't,

305
00:18:02,810 --> 00:18:05,310
we'll just give you so
obvious that it was,

306
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:07,860
yeah, so obviously it was, but
there's like, is there anything,

307
00:18:07,861 --> 00:18:10,860
any greater way to admit it
then to have this, you know,

308
00:18:10,890 --> 00:18:13,600
areas where you'd like to have a
country inside of country side,

309
00:18:13,601 --> 00:18:17,760
so they're allowed to, you know, gambling
is cool. We like gambling. Come on in.

310
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:21,140
Federal aid works with that though.

311
00:18:21,410 --> 00:18:24,200
That's a different thing because you
have all these other places that are

312
00:18:24,201 --> 00:18:27,680
getting by from federal aid, but then
you say, hey, you do your own thing. I,

313
00:18:27,730 --> 00:18:30,440
you know, like it would federal
aid can't fuck with gambling money.

314
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:33,800
Gambling money is way
more than federal aid.

315
00:18:34,070 --> 00:18:39,070
If you had to choose between getting
federal aid or the fucking Kazillions that

316
00:18:39,261 --> 00:18:42,220
casinos Raykin yeah. You know,
when you look at casinos,

317
00:18:42,221 --> 00:18:46,550
there's a reason why they're so
big. Yeah. Ran Places. But it's,

318
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:50,970
it's such a change. There is such a huge
gap from the top and the bottom. Yeah.

319
00:18:50,971 --> 00:18:53,060
You know,
the people that actually own the casinos,

320
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:57,320
a lot of tribes are actually
by birth. Right? You're part
of the casino. Some very,

321
00:18:57,321 --> 00:19:01,910
very small tribes. Um, like there's
a tribe, but he gets a check. Yes.

322
00:19:01,940 --> 00:19:06,650
That's sweet. Shockapy if you're
shockapy Indian your hours, just really,

323
00:19:06,660 --> 00:19:11,630
yeah. I tried, I tried to prove it was me.
I was like, come on, don't you see them?

324
00:19:12,110 --> 00:19:16,610
Nothing. No one, no DNA
test. What if, I mean,

325
00:19:16,611 --> 00:19:19,100
can they prove it? How
can they prove it? Um,

326
00:19:19,340 --> 00:19:22,510
and so just like you have to have
some sort of a family tree. Yeah.

327
00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:26,240
There's gotta be some sort
of registration, no proof.

328
00:19:26,260 --> 00:19:30,370
I actually have no idea to be
honest. I mean, yeah. I, I don't,

329
00:19:30,850 --> 00:19:32,360
I haven't figured it out.
It is a trip.

330
00:19:32,390 --> 00:19:36,080
So when you think about the fact
that there's nations within a nation,

331
00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:41,000
there's Indian reservations. It's like,
it's a really weird, it is interesting.

332
00:19:41,060 --> 00:19:44,420
A lot of fights there. When
a California, when marrow,

333
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:47,860
when mixed martial arts was illegal,
they used to have these fights in the,

334
00:19:47,861 --> 00:19:50,330
any casinos. Really the only
places that all men, yeah,

335
00:19:50,331 --> 00:19:53,920
the Indian casinos would let them come
and we would do like three of the key

336
00:19:53,921 --> 00:19:58,730
ones that
I guess it was the 90s Oh,

337
00:19:58,740 --> 00:20:01,010
it was illegal in the 90s
I didn't know that. Yeah,

338
00:20:01,011 --> 00:20:06,011
like the late nineties the UFC came about
in [inaudible] 93 and it was illegal

339
00:20:06,261 --> 00:20:07,610
here.
After that.

340
00:20:07,611 --> 00:20:11,480
It was like you could go and then
they got sanctioned and when they got

341
00:20:11,481 --> 00:20:14,300
sanctioned that now like we
have fights here all the time.

342
00:20:14,930 --> 00:20:18,020
I was going to be one next
weekend actually. A or August, uh,

343
00:20:18,530 --> 00:20:23,300
August 3rd or fourth on Fox. So I'm
like, they have him here all the time,

344
00:20:23,570 --> 00:20:26,810
but not back then you used to have to
go to these casinos were like in the

345
00:20:26,811 --> 00:20:27,644
middle of nowhere.

346
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:31,640
You would drive like way deep down these
weird fucking roads in the middle of

347
00:20:31,641 --> 00:20:34,700
nowhere and you'd find this casino and
that's what they'd have king of the cage

348
00:20:34,940 --> 00:20:37,790
and it would be in a parking
lot. And they fought out, right?

349
00:20:38,030 --> 00:20:41,580
Oh Man. Fight Club style.
They fun outside rock,

350
00:20:42,980 --> 00:20:44,600
which is what we're organizing illegally.

351
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:48,010
And one time these were fighting in

352
00:20:48,010 --> 00:20:51,340
a Sydney cause you know,
in the rain on this slippery surface.

353
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:54,820
So they're like throwing punches and
flying through the air and slipping and

354
00:20:54,821 --> 00:20:58,480
sliding all over the place.
Companies fracturing, pouring
rain. It sounds horrible.

355
00:20:58,690 --> 00:21:02,050
Ridiculous, ridiculous. But I mean that
was the kind of shit that was going on,

356
00:21:02,380 --> 00:21:03,090
you know?
And they were,

357
00:21:03,090 --> 00:21:05,620
they were allowed to do that only
because it was Indian reservations.

358
00:21:05,650 --> 00:21:09,580
Really nuts. Stop and think about it. They
would do, the Indians were like, come on,

359
00:21:09,610 --> 00:21:13,750
it will take your money.
Come on in. And Dude,

360
00:21:14,110 --> 00:21:16,900
they had no problem with it.
You know, like, why are you
guys paying such pussies?

361
00:21:17,510 --> 00:21:18,550
And meanwhile,
they were right.

362
00:21:19,470 --> 00:21:23,590
Man, there's, it's a, it's
such an interesting subject
because like, you know,

363
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:28,450
I'm really into the show deadwood. Oh,
the HBO show. Yeah. I'm obsessed with it.

364
00:21:28,451 --> 00:21:33,160
I, I fixed myself a whiskey and I
watch it for maybe more than a whisky.

365
00:21:33,460 --> 00:21:37,090
Um, and it's, you know, it's
beautifully shot and um, you know,

366
00:21:37,091 --> 00:21:41,200
but it's about deadwood. The town,
um, was in Montana. It's Montana

367
00:21:42,940 --> 00:21:47,230
or Wyoming, Wyoming Shit. I should know
this as a diehard fan. What an idiot.

368
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:52,500
Um, but anyway, it, uh, one of those old
west, yes at the time, but, you know,

369
00:21:52,510 --> 00:21:55,760
it was one of the last sort of
re one of the last towns. Um,

370
00:21:55,810 --> 00:21:57,710
that was sort of its own
law, which is why, you know,

371
00:21:57,760 --> 00:22:02,230
it's so wild and there's all these crazy,
you know, there's real cowboys, right?

372
00:22:02,290 --> 00:22:05,780
Real cowboys on TV. Um, but you know,

373
00:22:05,781 --> 00:22:10,240
that when they're also, you know,
in contention with, with, you know,

374
00:22:10,410 --> 00:22:15,040
local tribes and things, and there's,
there's these gnarly fights and, you know,

375
00:22:15,041 --> 00:22:19,550
it's, it's a, it's fictitious as a
television show, but it's also, you know,

376
00:22:19,810 --> 00:22:22,650
real in a sense that that was, that
actually happened at one point. It's,

377
00:22:22,930 --> 00:22:26,260
it's a really interesting sentiment
to sort of really let sink in.

378
00:22:26,261 --> 00:22:29,020
And it makes me really sad,
you know, because they were,

379
00:22:29,021 --> 00:22:33,340
they were just outcast and,
you know, then, then they
were on these reservations.

380
00:22:33,341 --> 00:22:35,980
And, you know, when you drive through
there, it's a really interesting,

381
00:22:36,340 --> 00:22:39,100
interesting thing because there's
casinos and, and then there's,

382
00:22:39,130 --> 00:22:43,810
there's these beautiful
historical, um, you know, uh,

383
00:22:43,870 --> 00:22:48,100
monuments and things, and like,
there's art, there's music, there's,

384
00:22:48,310 --> 00:22:52,900
there's traditional elements. Um, and I,
it's really, it's like this, like you're,

385
00:22:52,901 --> 00:22:57,190
you're sort of juxtapose next to the
traditional historic part and then the

386
00:22:57,191 --> 00:23:01,280
casinos and then like, what's happening
now, which is a lot of poverty. Um,

387
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:06,310
and so it's, it's really, it's really
a weird paradox to be in, you know,

388
00:23:06,311 --> 00:23:09,400
when you're going through there. And we
travel all the time. Um, but you know,

389
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:13,030
not to, not to go back to
where I started, but, um, the,

390
00:23:13,031 --> 00:23:15,960
the story was when we were talking about,
um,

391
00:23:16,330 --> 00:23:19,370
messing up a motel six hotel room,
um,

392
00:23:19,510 --> 00:23:22,150
when we were going through
a Navajo Indian country,

393
00:23:22,450 --> 00:23:27,070
we stopped at this gas station
and, um, I picked up a dog.

394
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:31,590
Um, she's, she's this new
little part of my life. Um,

395
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:36,530
somebody left her there for a
week and, um, it was really, yeah,

396
00:23:36,670 --> 00:23:39,320
yeah, she's, she's amazing. Um,

397
00:23:39,350 --> 00:23:41,830
and she just ran up to me and
like Kinda gave me like a,

398
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:45,130
like a little dog hug and I was like,
oh, whoa, whoa, Whoa, what are you doing?

399
00:23:45,420 --> 00:23:48,500
And you know, the, the people of the,
the gas station, we're like, yeah,

400
00:23:48,501 --> 00:23:50,990
she's been here a week, you know,
people drop their dogs all the time.

401
00:23:50,991 --> 00:23:54,650
And I was like, oh, people can
suck it. I'm taking the dog.

402
00:23:55,490 --> 00:23:57,800
But our first night with her,
she,

403
00:23:57,860 --> 00:24:01,190
I think she was freaked out because she
was outside for a week and, you know,

404
00:24:01,250 --> 00:24:04,190
eating out of dumpsters.
And then, um, you know,

405
00:24:04,191 --> 00:24:07,850
we brought her in the hotel room and
I had her outside for like 20 minutes.

406
00:24:07,851 --> 00:24:10,400
I was trying to get her to go to
the bathroom. It wasn't happy.

407
00:24:10,401 --> 00:24:13,720
She wasn't going all day, all day. We,

408
00:24:14,570 --> 00:24:17,240
we thought we thought she was
pregnant and I was like, oh no,

409
00:24:17,241 --> 00:24:20,630
this is going to be really bad. Um,
and then when we stopped at this,

410
00:24:20,660 --> 00:24:25,640
this Walmart to get the
necessary accoutrements for
dogs, like, you know, treats,

411
00:24:25,641 --> 00:24:28,040
leashes,
I'm in the parking lot of the Walmart.

412
00:24:28,041 --> 00:24:31,530
She took the biggest dog
shit I've ever seen take.

413
00:24:32,050 --> 00:24:36,040
And I needed two bags and it
was like five pounds disgusting.

414
00:24:36,470 --> 00:24:41,430
But then she didn't look
pregnant. I was like, she looks
starving, but you know, we,

415
00:24:41,431 --> 00:24:46,040
we took her around and, you
know, we basically, um, we're,

416
00:24:46,041 --> 00:24:47,330
we're trying to get her to go.
And she,

417
00:24:47,340 --> 00:24:50,300
she sort of went a little bit and I
think she was freaked out. But uh,

418
00:24:50,330 --> 00:24:53,620
to make a long story short, in the middle
of the night, she hopped up, not even,

419
00:24:53,660 --> 00:24:56,840
we all went to bed. She, she hopped
in bed with our tour manager.

420
00:24:56,841 --> 00:25:01,430
And just peed like,
like in like gallons.

421
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:03,630
And this was after we'd,
you know,

422
00:25:03,650 --> 00:25:07,850
we'd wash just as clumps of hair
washed or who was, he was a big deal.

423
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:12,410
She's a wild dog essentially. I
don't think she's, she definitely,

424
00:25:13,010 --> 00:25:16,490
she is now. She is. That was the only
time I've seen her just be an asshole.

425
00:25:16,491 --> 00:25:19,230
And I was like, her name is Louise
and I was like, what the Fuck Louise,

426
00:25:19,340 --> 00:25:21,730
you have some manners to
the Shell gas station?

427
00:25:22,210 --> 00:25:26,660
No Way. No Way. No Way. I mean,

428
00:25:26,661 --> 00:25:28,620
who hasn't peed the bed at some point,
right?

429
00:25:34,740 --> 00:25:37,810
You probably, you probably
need to live a little more sun.

430
00:25:37,820 --> 00:25:39,850
We should really challenge
ourselves, Ben, and you know,

431
00:25:39,870 --> 00:25:43,250
really just drink ourselves calls.
Do you get though?

432
00:25:43,370 --> 00:25:46,820
We think about peeing in a dream
and you're like, you motherfucker.

433
00:25:46,910 --> 00:25:50,550
And then you wake up that I felt that
in my adulthood. I'm not going to lie.

434
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:55,850
It creeps,
creeps,

435
00:25:55,970 --> 00:25:57,620
creeps right up to the
door. It's like, man,

436
00:25:57,920 --> 00:26:01,010
maybe we just go into this breath real
quick and P and I'll walk in and zip.

437
00:26:01,011 --> 00:26:03,650
I go,
I'm not in a bathroom while I'm sleeping.

438
00:26:03,950 --> 00:26:08,530
Mother fucker get angry.
Do you have an enlarged?

439
00:26:10,070 --> 00:26:14,990
No, it seems pretty normal, but
it's, you know, there you go.

440
00:26:15,260 --> 00:26:18,200
I talk in my sleep. That's
as far as it goes. You know,

441
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:20,960
I full on discussions.

442
00:26:20,961 --> 00:26:24,710
I could have a full on conversation
with someone and not know it and it was

443
00:26:24,711 --> 00:26:26,930
truthful, which is, you
know, when I should stop.

444
00:26:29,190 --> 00:26:31,430
Here's kind of fascinating
though that you can have,

445
00:26:31,431 --> 00:26:35,530
I mean I think most of us have had that
happen in some time in your life where

446
00:26:35,531 --> 00:26:38,110
you thought you were at a bathroom
and your dream and you peed.

447
00:26:38,350 --> 00:26:40,780
I haven't done that.
Never when you were a little kid thing.

448
00:26:40,810 --> 00:26:45,660
So I actually peed in like where I woke
up and I'm like, I'm peeing right now.

449
00:26:45,661 --> 00:26:48,930
This is crazy. I mean I do that
like you know, once a week.

450
00:26:48,931 --> 00:26:53,370
But where are you in bed when this is
how many going you imagine if like Brian

451
00:26:53,371 --> 00:26:56,500
just came out and told us he pisses
the bed once a week. That's so funny.

452
00:26:56,640 --> 00:27:01,590
It's like totally normal. I'm
driving right now. He has a little,

453
00:27:01,830 --> 00:27:04,620
have you ever had a pee in the car?
Never had a piano car.

454
00:27:04,650 --> 00:27:09,480
I peed out of my door while
dries into a bottle. God,

455
00:27:10,020 --> 00:27:12,300
that's impressive.
And you just hadn't cracked

456
00:27:14,120 --> 00:27:18,390
peed in a Gatorade bottle.
You just got to.

457
00:27:20,780 --> 00:27:21,613
Exactly.

458
00:27:25,510 --> 00:27:29,460
I think it's like, you know, if
you're, if you're stuck in the car

459
00:27:29,580 --> 00:27:33,150
and you and you don't do that,
your options are pissed all over yourself.

460
00:27:33,700 --> 00:27:38,440
[inaudible] break something internally.
Right. It's hard to know where that line,

461
00:27:38,470 --> 00:27:41,720
right. Where is, are you being a
pussy? A little bit of pampering?

462
00:27:43,690 --> 00:27:46,660
Oh yeah, for sure. We have
a nozzle. I'm definitely,

463
00:27:46,780 --> 00:27:50,710
I've definitely had some got to
run over and actually when we were,

464
00:27:50,711 --> 00:27:51,730
we played Sasquatch.

465
00:27:51,731 --> 00:27:54,880
I went and peed behind a haystack
and I felt really good about it.

466
00:27:54,881 --> 00:27:59,200
I felt like it was really authentic for
the festival that we were playing and I

467
00:27:59,201 --> 00:28:02,080
was really in a bad spot.
I had to go,

468
00:28:02,180 --> 00:28:06,070
one of my favorite moments of travel
and meeting random people that has to do

469
00:28:06,071 --> 00:28:09,520
with a Girl Ping in front of a hotel.
There were,

470
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:14,680
I was with mark the Hammer Coleman.
He's just a UFC heavyweight champion dude.

471
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:16,070
And me and him,
there was a,

472
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:20,740
we were at this weird little
strip club place in uh, Augusta,

473
00:28:20,741 --> 00:28:22,450
Georgia and this is like,

474
00:28:22,760 --> 00:28:23,593
we've been there.

475
00:28:24,450 --> 00:28:28,970
The pink pony that's
in Atlanta is like 96,

476
00:28:29,030 --> 00:28:30,560
maybe somewhere around then

477
00:28:31,310 --> 00:28:32,950
the sex.
And um,

478
00:28:33,050 --> 00:28:37,130
there's this girl that's working there
and she's got really stinky breath and

479
00:28:37,131 --> 00:28:37,750
she keeps trying to,

480
00:28:37,750 --> 00:28:40,460
Oh that's me. It was terrible.
It was what? She was really good

481
00:28:40,520 --> 00:28:43,190
aggressive and she was one of those girls.
It was like a white girl,

482
00:28:43,370 --> 00:28:45,950
but she talks like a
black girl and she's like,

483
00:28:45,980 --> 00:28:48,700
oh you don't even know what the
fuck y'all missing. You know,

484
00:28:48,770 --> 00:28:51,920
you don't even know what the fuck you.
So she winds up,

485
00:28:52,460 --> 00:28:54,500
mark winds up leaving,
we wind up,

486
00:28:54,770 --> 00:28:58,940
this girl is friends with a
girl that is with mark. So

487
00:28:59,010 --> 00:29:03,540
this girl stuck with her in the car. She's
wearing wrestling pants or wrestling,

488
00:29:03,900 --> 00:29:07,050
wrestling shoes and sweat pants and shit.
The whole time we're in the car.

489
00:29:07,170 --> 00:29:09,090
You don't know what
the fuck y'all missing.

490
00:29:09,091 --> 00:29:13,530
You don't know what that was the
beef sandwich you had for lunch?

491
00:29:13,531 --> 00:29:17,010
Cause I can smell it. It was the most
ridiculous thing ever. We get to the hotel

492
00:29:17,240 --> 00:29:20,520
and mark grabs his friend and bails

493
00:29:21,060 --> 00:29:21,990
leaves this like literally,

494
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:26,790
literally grabs her and runs with
her and this one is stuck outside,

495
00:29:26,910 --> 00:29:27,480
so she's like,

496
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:30,870
I need to know where mark the mother
fucking hammer Kallman's room is.

497
00:29:30,990 --> 00:29:33,990
She's like yell in the lobby.
They kicked her out of the hotel.

498
00:29:34,140 --> 00:29:38,190
She pulls down her pants and pulls
down her periods. She's p right.

499
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:42,040
And like the foyer area.
She got me out passing in

500
00:29:42,040 --> 00:29:46,630
the street like I'm some kind
of fucking animal. Oh my God.

501
00:29:46,631 --> 00:29:51,631
I hope you videotape that knows
there was no videos back in 1996 wow.

502
00:29:53,410 --> 00:29:57,040
To have a fucking camera with you back
then. You'll be carrying some with phs.

503
00:29:57,100 --> 00:30:00,940
Yeah. Big Ass. Big Ass taping it. Wow.

504
00:30:01,750 --> 00:30:05,560
I'll never forget her. I'll never
forget her. She was sober, right? Yeah,

505
00:30:05,561 --> 00:30:07,450
they should. They kicked her out when
they were trying to kick her out.

506
00:30:07,451 --> 00:30:08,380
You wanted to use the bathroom,

507
00:30:08,381 --> 00:30:11,560
which is one of the things that people
will do to try to regain control.

508
00:30:11,650 --> 00:30:13,840
Like if you getting kicked out
of a bar. Okay, okay, I'll leave.

509
00:30:13,870 --> 00:30:15,640
Let me use the bathroom first.
I'll leave.

510
00:30:15,970 --> 00:30:20,440
So it's like you get to leave sort of
on your terms. You get a little dignity,

511
00:30:20,441 --> 00:30:25,300
get a little power back. That's what
she was going to tip. She's like,

512
00:30:25,330 --> 00:30:27,130
she's like,
well they were kicking her out.

513
00:30:27,220 --> 00:30:30,880
I need to know where I marked a
mother fucking Hammer Coleman's rooms.

514
00:30:31,150 --> 00:30:32,890
They're like, ma'am, you have
to leave. You have to leave in.

515
00:30:32,891 --> 00:30:35,620
The security came over.
So I lead but I need to use a bathroom.

516
00:30:35,650 --> 00:30:36,760
I need to use the bathroom.

517
00:30:37,040 --> 00:30:39,290
And like she really did have
to leave it after she did.

518
00:30:39,291 --> 00:30:43,800
She squatted down and pushed her sweat
pants for us so she wouldn't be on him.

519
00:30:44,680 --> 00:30:47,350
I'll never forget the,
the, the river of pis.

520
00:30:47,860 --> 00:30:51,370
I'll never forget standing there
shaking my head. That sounds adorable.

521
00:30:51,790 --> 00:30:52,810
It was fantastic.

522
00:30:52,811 --> 00:30:57,280
I wish I knew her name cause I could
follow her on Facebook cause I know she

523
00:30:57,281 --> 00:30:58,870
says some awesome shit.
Oh,

524
00:30:59,270 --> 00:31:04,270
you know y'all got me out of here passing
in the street block on some kind of

525
00:31:04,541 --> 00:31:07,940
fucking animal. Never forget that. Like,

526
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:12,580
like follow. Yeah, yeah, please.

527
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:17,080
Yeah. And those are fun. Road stories
are the best. There's so many, you know,

528
00:31:17,081 --> 00:31:21,920
you meet the most interesting people
and only for a second, you know. Um,

529
00:31:22,420 --> 00:31:23,710
and uh,
yeah.

530
00:31:23,970 --> 00:31:28,180
Do you find it weird how different the
vibe is from city to city that the cities

531
00:31:28,181 --> 00:31:32,980
are so it's very, it's so
interesting isn't it? You're
like regionally, it's, yeah,

532
00:31:34,030 --> 00:31:39,030
it's really bizarre when you try to
absorb the whole United States as a whole

533
00:31:39,610 --> 00:31:43,900
and try to just wrap your head around how
many different communities and entails

534
00:31:44,280 --> 00:31:46,480
how huge it really is and how,
and how

535
00:31:46,510 --> 00:31:50,950
different it really is in different
parts. It's, it's amazing. I, I have, uh,

536
00:31:50,980 --> 00:31:54,940
I prefer those. No. You know, the sort
of like peeing in the middle of the,

537
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:59,820
the foyer or a lobby area moments,
which is usually some of,

538
00:31:59,860 --> 00:32:04,180
you know, you're in the deep south and
that's, there's some fun happening.

539
00:32:04,930 --> 00:32:08,210
Hopefully nobody gets shot.
Hmm. I feel like not, you know,

540
00:32:08,430 --> 00:32:13,000
I love the South Africa and obviously I'm
not, you know, calling out, um, you know,

541
00:32:13,180 --> 00:32:15,010
public urinating.
But like,

542
00:32:15,310 --> 00:32:18,370
I find that I'm in this southern style,

543
00:32:18,371 --> 00:32:23,290
you find a lot more sort of a candid
kind of person that, you know, there's,

544
00:32:23,291 --> 00:32:28,150
there's all these puns and things
that are so brilliant yet so simple,

545
00:32:28,570 --> 00:32:30,640
you know, like, like, you know,
sweating like a whore in church.

546
00:32:30,641 --> 00:32:34,760
That's my favorite of swing.
No horns. Like, yeah, that
really is a southern thing.

547
00:32:34,790 --> 00:32:36,640
That's another thing. And there's
still, I mean, they're infinite.

548
00:32:36,641 --> 00:32:40,100
There's so many of them. And I just,
I want to go down there and your puns,

549
00:32:40,130 --> 00:32:42,740
you know, I wanna, I
wanna, I wanna learn the,

550
00:32:42,741 --> 00:32:47,330
the southern vernacular and it's like an
arsenal of all these amazing things and

551
00:32:47,490 --> 00:32:47,640
yeah.

552
00:32:47,640 --> 00:32:51,450
You know, there's, we have a
good one. I card broken down

553
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:54,980
in the parking lot of this place because,
uh,

554
00:32:55,030 --> 00:32:57,950
we were just waiting for AAA or something
to come and then we roll into this

555
00:32:57,951 --> 00:33:00,840
sandwich spot. It was a subway, possibly.

556
00:33:00,841 --> 00:33:03,300
So it might've been a Blimpie or
something like that. Doesn't matter.

557
00:33:04,230 --> 00:33:08,380
The point is, and uh, the, these
two people, once we had ordered the,

558
00:33:08,410 --> 00:33:10,920
the woman who was making the sandwiches
in the sky, I'd walked in the door,

559
00:33:10,921 --> 00:33:14,250
just started bringing up the
Lorena Bobbitt story or something.

560
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:15,400
Lisa,
I think the,

561
00:33:15,550 --> 00:33:18,700
Lorena Bobbitt had been released from
prison or something or something had

562
00:33:18,701 --> 00:33:23,620
happened or, or a Bobbitt uh, the,
the man had done a porno or something.

563
00:33:23,621 --> 00:33:25,750
Like there was something that he had done,

564
00:33:25,751 --> 00:33:30,140
something that had happened in the
media that the name was relevant. Yeah.

565
00:33:30,380 --> 00:33:33,260
But yeah, and there's just conversing
and then you know, it gets,

566
00:33:33,261 --> 00:33:35,900
this poem is woman. She's sitting there
cutting a roast beef and she goes, yeah,

567
00:33:35,901 --> 00:33:36,550
she just,

568
00:33:36,550 --> 00:33:41,180
through that Dick in the middle of the
highway, how often do you hear that?

569
00:33:41,770 --> 00:33:46,510
Do that dig in the middle of the
highway and almost it on his bitch.

570
00:33:46,840 --> 00:33:49,900
I like, do you want extra meanings?
Yeah. And some chipotle sauce.

571
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:55,910
That's the south certainly has a lot
of flavor. I love it. I love it. Yeah.

572
00:33:55,911 --> 00:34:00,260
I'm a big fan of Texas. Favorite
places to perform. It's great.

573
00:34:00,261 --> 00:34:03,380
And I did my last special in Atlanta.
Did you land with the shit?

574
00:34:04,700 --> 00:34:07,570
That's probably been the place we
spend the most time it struck great.

575
00:34:07,680 --> 00:34:12,130
I'm a strip cause with this place called
the pink pony, Costco Strip clubs.

576
00:34:12,140 --> 00:34:13,820
There was like the Walmart,
Costco,

577
00:34:14,370 --> 00:34:18,900
there's every, every flower and just
everything you want. It was our first,

578
00:34:18,940 --> 00:34:23,910
it was our first strip club experience.
We, yeah. W for me. Was He not you?

579
00:34:23,911 --> 00:34:28,260
It was mine. We, we're just, we are
with our first record company. Um,

580
00:34:28,290 --> 00:34:32,940
and there, um, are you familiar with
the band jackal? I've heard the name.

581
00:34:33,030 --> 00:34:37,780
So you know it was a, with 80s, 90s,
80s, 80s and 90s. 80s, 90s. Yeah.

582
00:34:39,510 --> 00:34:43,650
I think he cock rock his cock cock
rock. Yeah, he would call it that. Okay.

583
00:34:43,920 --> 00:34:47,310
Well there's a member of the band
is, he's the lead singer. Yeah,

584
00:34:47,850 --> 00:34:51,240
Jesse James Dupree. How many people are
right now? Dude, you don't know who?

585
00:34:51,241 --> 00:34:55,920
Jacqueline Jackal. Well, Jesse James
Dupree is, is it an unbelievable,

586
00:34:55,921 --> 00:34:59,790
amazing human being in it and a
good friend of ours. And He, um,

587
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:04,820
he actually was affiliated with
our record company. Um, and um,

588
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:08,130
by the way, he plays the chainsaw. Huh?

589
00:35:08,370 --> 00:35:12,690
He plays a chainsaw on stage.
He had created a guitar out of a chainsaw.

590
00:35:12,930 --> 00:35:17,780
There's not too much of a, of a two
notes that's harmonious, um, you know,

591
00:35:17,790 --> 00:35:21,660
addition to the music. But it's more
of like it's a real chainsaw and he,

592
00:35:21,661 --> 00:35:26,661
he will play it and then he'll usually
like shred things like a wooden chair on

593
00:35:27,350 --> 00:35:27,990
the stage.

594
00:35:27,990 --> 00:35:32,560
We were opening for our
friend Rocco Deluca and Jesse
James came out on shredded

595
00:35:32,580 --> 00:35:35,520
things and it's fucking terrifying cause
please, please don't cut your leg off.

596
00:35:35,550 --> 00:35:36,900
Oh my, Oh my God. He just,

597
00:35:38,010 --> 00:35:41,040
how is that legal? I don't know.
Yeah, it just kind of happened,

598
00:35:41,041 --> 00:35:44,970
but they're playing this like dirty
blues rock down to the I am damn damn to

599
00:35:44,971 --> 00:35:46,070
contain and he just goes wrong.

600
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:53,610
Dual apart. That is so crazy.
Yeah. What does the audience go?

601
00:35:53,611 --> 00:35:58,320
Bananas. You have skin. It's
insane. How can you not that
must go ape shit. But the,

602
00:35:58,350 --> 00:36:03,210
but afterwards they took us in a
like a banana, yellow limousine

603
00:36:03,620 --> 00:36:07,940
from like the night like
eighties or nineties, like a
old limo, like, like stretch,

604
00:36:07,941 --> 00:36:12,720
limo. We get picked up, um, by Jesse
and there they are. There he is.

605
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:17,600
Oh my God.

606
00:36:19,030 --> 00:36:23,150
Oh my God. I'm on with
the, so I can hear it. Oh,

607
00:36:23,330 --> 00:36:24,380
there it is

608
00:36:27,770 --> 00:36:29,410
beyond awesome. Jesse j. That man

609
00:36:29,500 --> 00:36:32,260
took us to our first,
my first strip club experience,

610
00:36:37,740 --> 00:36:39,660
man.
He can really belt it.

611
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:43,020
He's very a AC dcs.
Yeah.

612
00:36:43,150 --> 00:36:46,020
Yes, yes. They have a huge
following. I mean they,

613
00:36:46,210 --> 00:36:50,560
I think they tore every summer for
like a month or so. Um, but he,

614
00:36:50,561 --> 00:36:54,970
he's incredible. And so we, we did like
a, we were in Atlanta for like 10 days,

615
00:36:54,971 --> 00:36:58,600
like four years ago, um, five
years, probably longer than that.

616
00:36:58,770 --> 00:37:00,610
But five or six years ago
we were brand spanking new.

617
00:37:00,611 --> 00:37:02,260
Like we hadn't even done
our first record yet.

618
00:37:02,590 --> 00:37:04,930
We're just trying to figure out
how to, you know, we're like, okay,

619
00:37:04,931 --> 00:37:06,250
I guess this is what bands do.

620
00:37:06,251 --> 00:37:10,870
And we get picked up by Jesse James
Dupree in a yellow taxi stretch limo. But,

621
00:37:11,160 --> 00:37:13,810
uh, you know, from the 1991.

622
00:37:14,170 --> 00:37:16,240
So it's a real old looking
vehicle and there's,

623
00:37:16,450 --> 00:37:18,160
there's a case of Miller
lite and he's like, you know,

624
00:37:18,161 --> 00:37:22,630
we're going to the Strip club. And I just
like, I remember being like, is this,

625
00:37:22,690 --> 00:37:24,580
it's like I think this is
what we're supposed to do.

626
00:37:24,581 --> 00:37:27,460
We're supposed to fucking get down
and like, and then like, you know,

627
00:37:27,461 --> 00:37:31,450
flash cut to like these fucking huge
tits in my face and I'm getting my first

628
00:37:31,451 --> 00:37:35,680
lap dance okay for by another record exec.
And you know,

629
00:37:35,681 --> 00:37:38,330
she kind of bit my neck and that was
fine, you know. But it was just like,

630
00:37:38,331 --> 00:37:41,250
he was really weird and she
and I smelled like her later.

631
00:37:43,640 --> 00:37:46,090
You like wow. Okay. But um,

632
00:37:46,520 --> 00:37:51,200
it's a weird thing. Yeah, it's a
weird thing. It was like 21 years old.

633
00:37:51,201 --> 00:37:54,890
Their bakery, strange light, Gray area,

634
00:37:55,740 --> 00:38:00,550
you know, cause it's not prostitution.
No, but an intimate moment,

635
00:38:00,940 --> 00:38:05,510
they're intimate with you for money. Like
they want to get close to you. I mean,

636
00:38:05,540 --> 00:38:08,330
it's nothing wrong with it. There's
nothing wrong with it. And it like,

637
00:38:08,331 --> 00:38:10,040
I don't think there's anything
wrong with prostitution.

638
00:38:10,370 --> 00:38:12,860
I think if you want to do it,
I don't, I don't recommend it.

639
00:38:13,190 --> 00:38:16,940
But I would say that there shouldn't
be laws against it. Legalize it. Yeah.

640
00:38:16,941 --> 00:38:18,620
If there's not laws
against fucking people,

641
00:38:18,621 --> 00:38:21,800
why should they be laws against
fucking people for money? That's crazy.

642
00:38:21,801 --> 00:38:25,430
That doesn't make any sense. It's
like just, it should be legal. I mean,

643
00:38:25,431 --> 00:38:27,800
I'm not saying you should do it.
You definitely shouldn't do it.

644
00:38:28,760 --> 00:38:31,820
Don't do the freedom. I don't know how
I feel about it to be honest with you.

645
00:38:31,821 --> 00:38:33,300
I'm just kind of like, you know, just uh,

646
00:38:33,330 --> 00:38:35,980
I just think the last
care of everybody took

647
00:38:35,980 --> 00:38:39,070
care of yourself.
But I think the last like laws like that,

648
00:38:39,080 --> 00:38:43,180
like why you most says, cause it doesn't
restrict anything. It just still happens.

649
00:38:43,210 --> 00:38:45,610
Then this happens the league and he just
happened to illegally and then people

650
00:38:45,611 --> 00:38:49,240
are doing things in a risky, isn't it
legal troubles in Nevada? No, it's not.

651
00:38:49,241 --> 00:38:52,270
It's legal. It's legal in certain
parts of Nevada. Very small area.

652
00:38:52,271 --> 00:38:55,750
We did a thing for it and the man
shows like, it's like a one county,

653
00:38:56,290 --> 00:38:59,600
I think it's really
okay.

654
00:39:01,810 --> 00:39:04,070
That's really interesting.
Do whatever the fuck you want.

655
00:39:04,110 --> 00:39:07,390
It's really interesting because
that particular brothel,

656
00:39:07,391 --> 00:39:11,560
if he willing to be to throw
back, um, is, is very, you know,

657
00:39:11,590 --> 00:39:13,900
it looks like they have a nice system,
you know,

658
00:39:13,930 --> 00:39:18,310
as far as being clean
and, and safe, you know,

659
00:39:18,340 --> 00:39:23,090
the clients that come in, you know, it's
not like how's it getting, you know,

660
00:39:23,770 --> 00:39:27,310
cut. Yeah. I mean look, you should be
able to, if that's what you want to work,

661
00:39:27,311 --> 00:39:30,280
you should be able to work there. It seems
to me that you're not hurting anybody.

662
00:39:30,281 --> 00:39:33,790
It's the music thing does, if our
Kickstarter account doesn't take off guys,

663
00:39:33,791 --> 00:39:38,791
I will be in the check book and find
me in that one county in Nevada and um,

664
00:39:39,670 --> 00:39:44,610
don't tease with Keven you,
he's like,

665
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:47,380
that's all there is a little baby steps.

666
00:39:47,381 --> 00:39:51,360
I don't want to be a clerk in a seven 11,
although actually I,

667
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:54,790
but before we do that, I would love
to work at trader Joe's, trader Joe's,

668
00:39:55,090 --> 00:39:58,960
they all think very happy that everybody's
so happy. They're healthy food.

669
00:39:59,020 --> 00:40:00,730
Probably get a discount.
If they didn't hire me,

670
00:40:00,731 --> 00:40:02,470
I would definitely end up in that brothel.

671
00:40:05,170 --> 00:40:09,370
Definitely there's not a lot of
options here were pretty obvious.

672
00:40:09,371 --> 00:40:12,640
That's where it'd be weird
when you watch those movies,

673
00:40:12,641 --> 00:40:16,870
the old west and they always had a brothel
and it was always like every fucking

674
00:40:16,930 --> 00:40:18,460
street was exactly the same.

675
00:40:18,490 --> 00:40:22,330
It was a dirt road and there was a bunch
of buildings real close to each other

676
00:40:22,331 --> 00:40:24,730
on one side and a bunch.
And that was the whole fucking town.

677
00:40:25,100 --> 00:40:28,840
I mean it was like the most
unoriginal architecture set up ever.

678
00:40:28,970 --> 00:40:31,840
And it was like the dumbest
engineering one straight town.

679
00:40:31,960 --> 00:40:34,360
There was your breath holders
you're building right now. It's fun.

680
00:40:34,780 --> 00:40:36,760
Entertainment has no bounds.
You know what I mean?

681
00:40:36,761 --> 00:40:39,890
Like there's so many different
flavors now. Must've sucked.

682
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:42,490
So hard to be stuck in the wild west.

683
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:46,270
Could you imagine how
bad or very little laws?

684
00:40:46,271 --> 00:40:48,550
I mean it's just people
were killing each other. We

685
00:40:50,920 --> 00:40:54,670
had to get used to body odor cause I'm
sure people smelled fucking terrible all

686
00:40:54,671 --> 00:40:55,504
the time.
And they were all

687
00:40:57,220 --> 00:41:01,090
three where it was an actual reality
that people would have draws.

688
00:41:01,210 --> 00:41:04,450
They would draw each other and see who
could pull their gun out the quickest.

689
00:41:04,451 --> 00:41:07,660
And shoot you, that was an actual
reality that there were guns

690
00:41:09,960 --> 00:41:12,300
by a lot of town.

691
00:41:12,310 --> 00:41:17,310
You get killed by bandits or something
or the Indian tribe that you stole the

692
00:41:17,981 --> 00:41:20,890
land from, he's going to kill Ya.
Yeah, and there's a lot of those towns,

693
00:41:20,891 --> 00:41:22,580
they did a make it,
they just,

694
00:41:22,581 --> 00:41:25,510
they were there for a little while and
then the mine dried up or whatever the

695
00:41:25,511 --> 00:41:28,360
fuck was dragging people.
They're dried up and that's it.

696
00:41:28,510 --> 00:41:31,380
And then you could go through a
whole town and see, oh, real ghosts.

697
00:41:31,820 --> 00:41:36,160
It's fascinating. Ooh, you
can feel the energy. It's,

698
00:41:36,170 --> 00:41:38,660
it's pretty wild at sounds so hippy dippy.

699
00:41:38,930 --> 00:41:43,610
But there's a guy that named Rupert
Sheldrake and I think he believes that

700
00:41:43,880 --> 00:41:47,310
there's some type of memory in
everything and he is in the eye.

701
00:41:47,380 --> 00:41:51,390
The idea is that like,
like even objects like the,

702
00:41:51,391 --> 00:41:54,230
the actually do contain
some sort of memory.

703
00:41:54,620 --> 00:41:57,470
That's why people get creeped out in
a house where someone was murdered.

704
00:41:57,650 --> 00:42:00,470
You don't want,
even though I happened a long time ago,

705
00:42:00,500 --> 00:42:03,050
you don't want to be in that house.
You don't want to be in that spot.

706
00:42:03,470 --> 00:42:04,580
It was like New York City.

707
00:42:04,610 --> 00:42:07,400
I feel like there's such a powerful
energy there because there's so much

708
00:42:07,401 --> 00:42:11,450
residual memory there. You know what I
mean? It's like there's definitely that.

709
00:42:11,630 --> 00:42:15,770
There's an energy to it. Right.
Where were we? We were there, uh,

710
00:42:15,860 --> 00:42:19,300
like a couple months ago we
were on tour and um, you,

711
00:42:19,450 --> 00:42:24,230
we were stopping to get some lunch and
in the middle of, um, I'm not sure,

712
00:42:24,231 --> 00:42:25,670
like mid town area.
It wasn't there.

713
00:42:25,850 --> 00:42:29,900
There's this like cemetery literally in
the middle of tiny little cemetery in

714
00:42:29,901 --> 00:42:31,070
the middle of the block.

715
00:42:31,580 --> 00:42:34,430
And it was so interesting because
I think it was sanctioned off.

716
00:42:34,431 --> 00:42:37,070
Like you couldn't build anything there.
It was,

717
00:42:37,340 --> 00:42:41,990
it was legitimately protected and
he was so like, it was from like,

718
00:42:42,160 --> 00:42:43,840
was it like the 18 hundreds?
Yeah.

719
00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:47,270
Well then you realize all these towns
like New York used to be a city like that

720
00:42:47,271 --> 00:42:50,360
town. I mean it was, it wasn't
just one member gangs in New York.

721
00:42:50,450 --> 00:42:55,340
That was pretty awesome. Awesome.
Cameron Diaz redhead. Yeah. What?

722
00:42:55,760 --> 00:42:59,420
Yeah. Daniel Day Lewis got us
killing mother fuckers. God Damn,

723
00:42:59,460 --> 00:43:02,810
that dude's a bad motherfucker.
That movie. Jesus Christ,

724
00:43:02,900 --> 00:43:05,090
would it build the butchers?
I went, his name was,

725
00:43:06,650 --> 00:43:09,110
that was what New York was really likely.
You think of New York.

726
00:43:09,111 --> 00:43:12,080
It's always being like, hey,
beep Hong Kong. No, no, no, no.

727
00:43:12,081 --> 00:43:16,010
They were on the fucking horses band.
They started out on horsepowers. Yeah.

728
00:43:16,011 --> 00:43:19,520
With cleavers jacking each other.
They're on the streets.

729
00:43:19,550 --> 00:43:24,130
Have you read any Caleb car books? No.
There's a book called the elitist. Um,

730
00:43:24,140 --> 00:43:28,130
and then, um, yeah, Angel of darkness,
darkness is the other one. Um, but he,

731
00:43:28,190 --> 00:43:33,040
he's an incredible author and had written
these amazing stories about New York

732
00:43:33,041 --> 00:43:35,300
in a very dark, um, but, uh, circa

733
00:43:35,690 --> 00:43:39,740
crime novels or historical crime novels.
They're amazing. And it's like this,

734
00:43:39,770 --> 00:43:44,330
it puts you in this world,
the late 18 hundreds in New York City.

735
00:43:44,660 --> 00:43:45,560
Um,
and,

736
00:43:45,561 --> 00:43:50,210
and it bases around this figure who
using psychology to solve these serial

737
00:43:51,260 --> 00:43:52,730
killings for the first time.
You know,

738
00:43:52,731 --> 00:43:56,270
like the first time the psychology and
psychiatry is used to analyze these

739
00:43:56,271 --> 00:43:57,800
crimes.
Um,

740
00:43:58,420 --> 00:44:02,680
anyway. But yeah, but like the visual
of the town is pretty wild because it's,

741
00:44:02,830 --> 00:44:04,200
he uses actual,
um,

742
00:44:04,810 --> 00:44:09,550
like actual places that were
relevant to the time and it's,

743
00:44:09,580 --> 00:44:12,250
you know, it's pretty,
pretty interesting. You know,

744
00:44:12,251 --> 00:44:14,500
there's a lot of gangs like things
in New York and things like that.

745
00:44:15,610 --> 00:44:18,280
Cocaine and prostitution and you know,

746
00:44:18,281 --> 00:44:22,150
all the great things that are
happening now forcibly less,

747
00:44:23,190 --> 00:44:26,230
right. They were, they were
crazy back then. There's a lot,

748
00:44:26,231 --> 00:44:29,980
I mean the idea of living in sort
of a semi lawless place like that,

749
00:44:29,981 --> 00:44:32,010
we just had to kind of
count the sheriff to right a

750
00:44:32,010 --> 00:44:36,060
wrong and go get this poor guy and he's
ready to retire and he's got a stupid

751
00:44:36,061 --> 00:44:39,870
gold star on like in the movies.
And that's what life on the road is like.

752
00:44:41,760 --> 00:44:46,590
Wait, looking out for the sheriff, who
is the sheriff and honey honey? Oh God.

753
00:44:46,650 --> 00:44:51,390
I don't know. Maybe you guys having a
power struggle right in front of me.

754
00:44:52,410 --> 00:44:55,980
Definitely not to play tennis.
This morning

755
00:44:58,680 --> 00:45:02,670
I was up three games. It was up three
nothing and I was fucking killing it.

756
00:45:03,360 --> 00:45:05,460
And then I got cocky and it's my fault,

757
00:45:05,940 --> 00:45:09,050
but you know what I can you say
it's your fault if he says, well,

758
00:45:09,090 --> 00:45:12,900
I got cocky and then my niece and I
couldn't get those far right shots and it

759
00:45:12,901 --> 00:45:15,720
was, I lost six, three
and I felt like a chump.

760
00:45:15,970 --> 00:45:17,480
It seems like you're to
get really mad at it.

761
00:45:17,490 --> 00:45:20,400
Didn't talk to Ben for like an hour.
You getting mad when you lost.

762
00:45:21,510 --> 00:45:22,860
I was really compounders of the above.

763
00:45:22,861 --> 00:45:26,300
That was a big moment
for me because I know

764
00:45:28,740 --> 00:45:31,770
some people have to learn how to not
be angry at people when they play games

765
00:45:31,771 --> 00:45:36,430
with them. I Games is when I was a
little kid. I used to have that. Yeah,

766
00:45:36,480 --> 00:45:39,180
would be angry if I played a game with
someone and they beat me and be hungry.

767
00:45:39,181 --> 00:45:43,580
You know what's funny? I only do, I only
do that with Ben. I swear to God though.

768
00:45:44,250 --> 00:45:46,050
You weren't really upset
at him for an hour.

769
00:45:46,051 --> 00:45:50,310
We know I was upset with myself
and I was like kind of a game. No,

770
00:45:50,820 --> 00:45:54,570
not really.
She's entitled to beating me real like,

771
00:45:55,510 --> 00:45:58,130
but she's not beating me something.
And you say

772
00:46:00,940 --> 00:46:05,850
why
new moods working?

773
00:46:06,540 --> 00:46:08,970
Yeah,
it's already kicking off the whiskey.

774
00:46:11,710 --> 00:46:16,660
Um, how long have you
been playing tennis? Um,

775
00:46:17,310 --> 00:46:21,600
I don't know. I mean I didn't play
well when I retired as a professional,

776
00:46:22,530 --> 00:46:27,180
dammit.
Probably like six or seven years,

777
00:46:27,350 --> 00:46:30,420
you know.
But like recreationally speaking,

778
00:46:31,980 --> 00:46:34,890
something that always looked really fun
to me. It's really great. It's great.

779
00:46:34,930 --> 00:46:38,910
It's great workout. I played it
once. Total body kind of thing.

780
00:46:39,300 --> 00:46:43,440
My friend rich syslog is a really good
tennis player. I played with him once.

781
00:46:43,760 --> 00:46:46,930
That's it.
I don't know to be honest with you.

782
00:46:47,670 --> 00:46:48,810
It's really fun.

783
00:46:48,811 --> 00:46:52,320
We actually started playing as a band
because both our bass player and drummer

784
00:46:52,590 --> 00:46:57,590
play and you know when you're on the road
you have very few opportunities to get

785
00:46:57,811 --> 00:47:01,640
physical exercise. I mean those should
be a good way to get it out. Yeah,

786
00:47:01,650 --> 00:47:05,430
we have a really good time. So the
whole competitive thing is harmless.

787
00:47:05,431 --> 00:47:06,270
It's just kind of funny.

788
00:47:06,271 --> 00:47:10,320
There's like you have these
little championships within
yourself where I'm like,

789
00:47:10,700 --> 00:47:14,350
I am going to beat Ben because I,
I need this.

790
00:47:15,990 --> 00:47:17,370
I'm going to play the solo tonight.

791
00:47:20,160 --> 00:47:21,370
Not Allowed to talk into the mic.

792
00:47:25,130 --> 00:47:29,410
Guys have negotiations. That's kind
of cool. Have like rock, paper,

793
00:47:29,411 --> 00:47:33,630
scissors to what songs do it
onstage all the time. It's really,

794
00:47:33,790 --> 00:47:35,980
you guys seem to get along really well

795
00:47:36,060 --> 00:47:40,560
for a guy and a girl in a band together.
I mean that's,

796
00:47:40,800 --> 00:47:44,370
we were just talking about
that actually because it's,

797
00:47:44,371 --> 00:47:48,030
it's really difficult right now.
There's, there's a lot of, um,

798
00:47:48,090 --> 00:47:51,000
I've been a real asshole. No, you
haven't. You're fucking great.

799
00:47:51,001 --> 00:47:55,080
I've been the assholes. I was such a
Dick on the way over here. I was so,

800
00:47:55,280 --> 00:47:59,340
so basically we're dealing, we
really did. I was, I was like,

801
00:47:59,370 --> 00:48:03,330
I wanted to kick my dashboard.
I was, because I haven't
slept for like three days.

802
00:48:03,540 --> 00:48:07,560
We, we'd been on the road and you know
where you draw sometimes you drive after a

803
00:48:07,561 --> 00:48:11,310
show and then you get to a
hotel. And like, in my mind,
I'm like, you have to sleep.

804
00:48:11,311 --> 00:48:12,810
If you don't sleep,
you're gonna be fucked tomorrow.

805
00:48:12,811 --> 00:48:14,850
And then I'm thinking about sleeping,
I don't sleep.

806
00:48:15,270 --> 00:48:17,880
And then you get exhausted.

807
00:48:18,360 --> 00:48:22,720
And with exhaustion comes like a
slight bout of depression. And I'm,

808
00:48:22,721 --> 00:48:26,790
I'm not a really, I'm not a depressed
depressive person when I am,

809
00:48:26,850 --> 00:48:31,380
I have to like really tackle it. Right.
Cause I want to, I want to rise above. Um,

810
00:48:31,410 --> 00:48:33,360
but it, it's definitely, um,

811
00:48:34,080 --> 00:48:37,110
another element that you really have to
contend with on the road because you're

812
00:48:37,111 --> 00:48:40,830
constantly in these uncomfortable
positions. You're not eating well,

813
00:48:40,831 --> 00:48:42,300
you're not sleeping,
you're,

814
00:48:42,301 --> 00:48:46,440
you're playing every night and you're
traveling and you're like in a van for

815
00:48:46,441 --> 00:48:50,790
eight hours, sometimes 10, 12
hours depending on the drive,

816
00:48:50,791 --> 00:48:52,470
which is part of where we're at.

817
00:48:52,471 --> 00:48:56,610
And part of why we should talk about our
Kickstarter campaign, um, because it's,

818
00:48:56,940 --> 00:48:59,030
it's, you know, where
we're at basically. But I,

819
00:48:59,240 --> 00:49:01,290
I was kind of a monster
on the way over here.

820
00:49:01,320 --> 00:49:04,770
We were in bumper to bumper
traffic and I was not to you,

821
00:49:04,771 --> 00:49:09,690
it was mainly mainly about myself. I
was, I don't attack you or your person,

822
00:49:10,330 --> 00:49:12,150
but,
but we were talking about how,

823
00:49:12,270 --> 00:49:15,660
how funny it is that after being
a band for like seven years,

824
00:49:15,900 --> 00:49:19,440
we're pretty resilient. Like we don't,
you know, at the end of the day,

825
00:49:19,441 --> 00:49:23,850
like Ben's my best friend and I love him
and I don't want to make him feel bad

826
00:49:23,851 --> 00:49:24,870
or hurt him ever.

827
00:49:25,140 --> 00:49:25,261
Well,

828
00:49:25,261 --> 00:49:28,070
I feel like that's why we've been able
to be a band for seven years because we'd

829
00:49:28,071 --> 00:49:31,290
just been fighting the whole God damn
time. That's how it works. You're stupid.

830
00:49:31,410 --> 00:49:34,950
You're stupid. You're figuring
out how to make up every time.

831
00:49:34,951 --> 00:49:37,740
You know what I mean?
It's like what are the biggest thing?

832
00:49:37,770 --> 00:49:39,030
What are the fights usually about?

833
00:49:39,280 --> 00:49:42,890
The lives is a very well, both.

834
00:49:43,700 --> 00:49:48,010
The first thing that comes
to mind is driving. Um, I
usually I get mad at you. You

835
00:49:48,070 --> 00:49:50,820
fine with it. Yeah. We fight a lot
in the car when it's like turn left,

836
00:49:52,970 --> 00:49:56,930
you know, that kind of shit. That's loud,
fun, know. That's always really fun.

837
00:49:57,270 --> 00:50:00,210
It's like the stupid shit.
It's stupid. It's, you know.

838
00:50:01,340 --> 00:50:04,950
Did you guys watch our video?
No, not yet. Oh, what is this?

839
00:50:05,540 --> 00:50:09,710
That's our Kickstarter video.
I should go to the bathroom now.

840
00:50:09,920 --> 00:50:13,730
What is the Kickstarter thing
about? What's it about? Well,

841
00:50:13,731 --> 00:50:17,720
you should watch it and then I guess we'll
talk about will this bit because some

842
00:50:17,721 --> 00:50:22,590
of these people are, listen, ready.

843
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:27,940
We need money for our next tour.
I love you too and

844
00:50:28,040 --> 00:50:30,350
so brave.
So brave.

845
00:50:39,370 --> 00:50:43,230
No, we're sorry we
didn't tell you. This is

846
00:50:45,400 --> 00:50:49,310
for folks. They have a chicken and
the roots. Lipstick on their face.

847
00:50:50,330 --> 00:50:51,220
Donkey Guru.

848
00:50:52,110 --> 00:50:55,760
They're about to have sex with a donkey.
Travel hundreds of miles to see you.

849
00:50:57,020 --> 00:51:00,320
We are on a dark path
and you seek your counsel

850
00:51:01,710 --> 00:51:05,130
in exchange for your advice.
We offer you the body of Suzanne,

851
00:51:05,131 --> 00:51:09,870
my band mate and friend. She
is a young woman. New Bile,

852
00:51:10,040 --> 00:51:10,410
great

853
00:51:10,410 --> 00:51:12,050
flexible,
a donkey guru.

854
00:51:12,270 --> 00:51:17,270
We're actually on offering the body of
Suzanne and I think who my associate

855
00:51:17,401 --> 00:51:21,140
meant to say is he's
offering his own body to you.

856
00:51:21,660 --> 00:51:24,950
I'm positive. That's what he meant.
She talked about it. Absolutely.

857
00:51:25,460 --> 00:51:29,080
You know, we didn't talk about this at
all, but I didn't figure it out. I know.

858
00:51:29,330 --> 00:51:31,730
I don't think, I think that's a
terrible idea of whether the chicken,

859
00:51:31,920 --> 00:51:33,560
it's a rooster.
Whenever

860
00:51:34,410 --> 00:51:38,100
in exchange for your pearls of wisdom
nuggets, we would like to offer

861
00:51:41,290 --> 00:51:45,040
a very warm and loving companion,
violet von Rooster.

862
00:51:45,060 --> 00:51:49,410
Stein a violet has been with
us for the past 47 days.

863
00:51:49,890 --> 00:51:54,480
We found him in New Mexico. We hope
you humbly accept this is off right?

864
00:51:56,690 --> 00:51:58,180
That'd be cool.
Flowing with

865
00:52:01,510 --> 00:52:02,310
the roasters

866
00:52:02,310 --> 00:52:05,040
going towards the donkey and
they were on their knees.

867
00:52:05,990 --> 00:52:08,940
Now the donkey is having sex
with the rooster for your audio.

868
00:52:13,910 --> 00:52:18,450
He liked it. Take your time. Donkey.
He's still having sex with it.

869
00:52:18,451 --> 00:52:21,950
He's slow.
First thing I love,

870
00:52:23,720 --> 00:52:25,650
how high were you guys when you made those

871
00:52:29,420 --> 00:52:33,800
high points? I mean, it really
showcases Ben's acting skills.

872
00:52:34,040 --> 00:52:36,800
This is one of the weirdest fucking
thing I've ever seen in my life.

873
00:52:38,530 --> 00:52:40,040
That doesn't give the one last thing.

874
00:52:40,041 --> 00:52:43,610
We can offer you our
most prized possession.

875
00:52:44,370 --> 00:52:47,630
Oh, we took a little, but that's fine.

876
00:52:47,631 --> 00:52:49,430
We share it with you this way.

877
00:52:49,550 --> 00:52:53,870
Take this piece of our heart and
we're just looking for answers.

878
00:52:53,871 --> 00:52:57,160
Guys gives the Jack Daniels dunking.

879
00:52:57,590 --> 00:53:01,970
Be The fucking Jack. Dan, how
do we get back to the raw?

880
00:53:02,050 --> 00:53:06,370
Ooh, stocky. We're sorry
if we've wasted your time,

881
00:53:06,371 --> 00:53:11,170
but this isn't for us. You don't
have the answers we're looking for.

882
00:53:12,190 --> 00:53:16,580
We're going to go now.
Thank you and good.

883
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:19,450
No, you know what? Fuck you.

884
00:53:22,970 --> 00:53:25,810
You guys,
you guys play not,

885
00:53:27,660 --> 00:53:28,950
you guys might be crazy.

886
00:53:31,450 --> 00:53:32,880
There's a purpose to this.

887
00:53:33,730 --> 00:53:34,840
If you've made it this far,

888
00:53:34,841 --> 00:53:39,470
you are either a die honey honey
or you're just really into donkeys,

889
00:53:40,150 --> 00:53:43,930
which is understandable because
the donkey is a magnificent beasts.

890
00:53:45,520 --> 00:53:50,520
We created this Kickstarter project
to fund are rigorous and also vigorous

891
00:53:50,651 --> 00:53:55,300
touring schedule, which as emotionally
priceless as it is, which is the truth,

892
00:53:55,630 --> 00:53:59,820
has left a gaping black hole
where the money should be. Um,

893
00:54:00,340 --> 00:54:04,390
life's hard. You gotta roll with
it. You've got to roll with it. Um,

894
00:54:04,660 --> 00:54:08,170
our goal is to raise $17,000.
This will cover our van rental.

895
00:54:08,171 --> 00:54:12,130
Our tour manager are stalwart
bandmates Patrick Taylor,

896
00:54:12,250 --> 00:54:16,580
also known as [inaudible] jazz
and Jerry Porter, uncle Jaggedy,

897
00:54:17,370 --> 00:54:20,590
Jay eggs, also gas and merchandise. Yes.

898
00:54:20,920 --> 00:54:23,440
We're so thankful for all the
support we've gotten this far.

899
00:54:23,800 --> 00:54:27,730
We just want to keep making this music,
uh, performing it all over the country.

900
00:54:27,840 --> 00:54:32,840
He may be the why and whether you donate
money or just send your happiness and

901
00:54:33,941 --> 00:54:38,920
good vibes and love.
We are overjoyed to be reaching him.

902
00:54:40,780 --> 00:54:43,690
Touching you,
touching you

903
00:54:46,630 --> 00:54:50,500
touched by you.
You've definitely touched us.

904
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:51,833
Record guy

905
00:54:53,680 --> 00:54:58,290
guys. Really a doctor.
There's something going on.

906
00:55:01,020 --> 00:55:05,130
I'm going to refresh it now because
this hasn't been refreshed. Oh my God,

907
00:55:05,131 --> 00:55:08,970
that's fantastic.
I'm on to make a deal.

908
00:55:10,080 --> 00:55:10,950
No,
that's good.

909
00:55:10,951 --> 00:55:13,980
That's really good were but honestly
it's just what people are doing now.

910
00:55:14,120 --> 00:55:16,890
Oh yeah. Is this the new thing? Yeah.

911
00:55:16,970 --> 00:55:20,750
We've been like one of it's
creating like the last six months.

912
00:55:20,751 --> 00:55:24,980
I feel like all of these people are
coming out with these kickstarters and so

913
00:55:24,981 --> 00:55:27,230
how does it work?
It's like you just,

914
00:55:27,231 --> 00:55:31,400
you tell them like say like you want a
pizza and like do you want to order a

915
00:55:31,401 --> 00:55:34,310
large piece? You don't have any money
put in Kickstarter saying like, Hey,

916
00:55:34,311 --> 00:55:38,240
I helped me buy this pizza
people and if I can make $15,

917
00:55:38,390 --> 00:55:39,201
I'll let you have a bite.

918
00:55:39,201 --> 00:55:42,920
If you're anywhere near me and then
they give you $15 and then you go by.

919
00:55:43,040 --> 00:55:47,480
We actually have an incredible
reward system. Um, it's really fun.

920
00:55:47,481 --> 00:55:52,190
I swear to God you were talking about
workouts earlier. Um, I mean the top,

921
00:55:52,280 --> 00:55:56,840
the top reward for, I feel like I
should go from the bottom and start,

922
00:55:56,990 --> 00:56:00,620
but the biggest reward is
if someone donates $1,000,

923
00:56:00,621 --> 00:56:05,600
which is incredible, you know,
donation unless you a player.

924
00:56:05,890 --> 00:56:06,720
What I mean?

925
00:56:06,720 --> 00:56:09,780
Damn well there you go up and drop it.

926
00:56:10,050 --> 00:56:12,940
K One cane on honey, honey man. What up?

927
00:56:13,090 --> 00:56:16,150
Other than all the rewards
beneath the thousand dollars,

928
00:56:16,151 --> 00:56:18,220
which are really fun workout video

929
00:56:19,810 --> 00:56:24,010
specifically to you as warriors
of the road, we have effective

930
00:56:24,010 --> 00:56:27,250
and innovative measures to stay in
a quasi peak physical condition.

931
00:56:27,500 --> 00:56:31,390
Employing tactics like sarcasm,
cloying, temptation and yelling.

932
00:56:33,280 --> 00:56:37,210
Let us see your Billy blanks.
You guys are ridiculous.

933
00:56:37,780 --> 00:56:40,550
What is wrong with you guys?
Times different.

934
00:56:41,710 --> 00:56:45,100
I have a question that what it is
or is it just your silly $500 one?

935
00:56:45,101 --> 00:56:48,820
It says you get a half hour Skype with
whiskey and with hangout with Suzanne and

936
00:56:48,821 --> 00:56:52,720
Ben's. Eat your, your, you get to Cam with
you now. Ben, do you have to be there?

937
00:56:52,840 --> 00:56:55,540
I do actually.
What is the over under

938
00:56:58,790 --> 00:57:02,680
stop too?
What's the over under on Dick Pics?

939
00:57:03,660 --> 00:57:06,250
I don't know. How many are you
gonna get in return? Hello?

940
00:57:08,590 --> 00:57:12,270
Can you see them as they see you sweat?
That could waste,

941
00:57:13,470 --> 00:57:16,600
cause I didn't see a lot of ducks.
I haven't camped in a while,

942
00:57:16,601 --> 00:57:20,590
but half hour with whiskey.
I think I might get a little weird.

943
00:57:20,650 --> 00:57:21,700
Have you heard this

944
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:23,960
Facebook push? They're uh, they're,

945
00:57:24,010 --> 00:57:28,240
they're trying to get people to log in
the youtube comments through Facebook.

946
00:57:28,241 --> 00:57:32,080
So you use your own identity
now it's kind of interesting.

947
00:57:32,710 --> 00:57:36,600
I like that idea. Yeah, that
would stop a lot of cons. Yeah.

948
00:57:36,970 --> 00:57:38,740
Stop a lot of Cantinas.
Yeah.

949
00:57:38,830 --> 00:57:41,690
What if you found out the conti has
comments where by someone, you know,

950
00:57:41,700 --> 00:57:46,700
you're like Q sata had
the worst news of a patch.

951
00:57:47,590 --> 00:57:50,140
Cool comments can really,
really get under your skin,

952
00:57:50,141 --> 00:57:53,440
but you really need to be the
better man and walk away. You do.

953
00:57:53,441 --> 00:57:56,830
But it's a fascinating thing that
the people can just reach out to you.

954
00:57:57,350 --> 00:57:59,620
What did we find out?
It's all just one person,

955
00:57:59,621 --> 00:58:03,830
like the chocolate rain dude or
something like that. I met him, Brian,

956
00:58:05,640 --> 00:58:09,220
we did this. I'm one of those things.
Weird things for Twitter was for Twitter,

957
00:58:09,221 --> 00:58:13,580
right? It wasn't a tweet. The
Twitter fest or some of fast, yeah.

958
00:58:13,900 --> 00:58:16,360
Who made the chocolate rain guy?
You gotta Pee Rocket

959
00:58:17,950 --> 00:58:19,930
Chocolate Rain Guy and
we haven't talk about you

960
00:58:23,350 --> 00:58:28,120
by the way. FYI. If Brian gives
you a chocolate bar, how was it?

961
00:58:28,300 --> 00:58:31,630
And it says only eat half.
I would say only eat a quarter.

962
00:58:34,950 --> 00:58:36,220
It's, you know, it's like,

963
00:58:36,340 --> 00:58:40,270
it's like you're trying to do a bear,

964
00:58:40,271 --> 00:58:44,440
run up an icy mountain.
That's what it's like.

965
00:58:45,040 --> 00:58:47,210
Your eyes were his life.
Oh my God.

966
00:58:48,290 --> 00:58:52,050
It's probably as high as I've
ever been on earth doing a,

967
00:58:53,150 --> 00:58:57,720
yeah. Making your own bars. No,
he just needed some. We were,

968
00:58:57,721 --> 00:59:00,250
we were talking about how ridiculous
these things are because you never know

969
00:59:00,251 --> 00:59:04,090
what the actual dosages as part of
the problem with a peanut illegal.

970
00:59:04,770 --> 00:59:06,420
Well you do regulate it either.

971
00:59:06,450 --> 00:59:11,450
This is like the La speed weed and on
the back it says 17% THC and it tells you

972
00:59:11,821 --> 00:59:14,820
that the amount that's in it, but you
have no idea what that means. It's like,

973
00:59:14,821 --> 00:59:16,030
oh yeah,
it's 17%

974
00:59:16,050 --> 00:59:19,980
THC. Well, we live literally in
the wild west of weed. I mean,

975
00:59:19,981 --> 00:59:22,040
this is a crazy time.
There's never a

976
00:59:22,040 --> 00:59:26,750
timeline that we can go to a store and
there's hundreds of them and you just buy

977
00:59:26,850 --> 00:59:30,680
the weed like that. That's it. That should
even exist. Look at it that it says,

978
00:59:30,681 --> 00:59:31,640
actually it says right here,

979
00:59:31,670 --> 00:59:36,670
it says pat package contains
a 1.5 grams of Skywalker Oji.

980
00:59:38,060 --> 00:59:41,840
So these gummy bears, I'll give you an
idea. One point. Yeah. We eat all of them.

981
00:59:41,870 --> 00:59:45,620
Yeah. If you need all these sort of
[inaudible], what does a normal winter,

982
00:59:45,650 --> 00:59:50,040
what's your Candy Bar State?
How many grams is that? Oops,

983
00:59:50,420 --> 00:59:55,150
sorry. Uh, this contains, uh,

984
00:59:55,170 --> 00:59:58,880
where's it say, did they actually have
to do that? Is that like a new thing? No,

985
00:59:58,881 --> 01:00:02,210
I think that they just do it. The
Elliot speed, we'd people. Oh, okay.

986
01:00:02,211 --> 01:00:04,610
So there's some people who
have like a system. Yeah.

987
01:00:04,700 --> 01:00:06,920
So you just got to get to
use to their system. Right.

988
01:00:06,960 --> 01:00:08,990
Because you never really know.
It's the weirdest thing.

989
01:00:08,991 --> 01:00:12,200
Like you can buy from someplace, the
first of all, the people that work there,

990
01:00:12,690 --> 01:00:17,000
daycare. But if you work at a weed
store, chances are you go deep,

991
01:00:17,630 --> 01:00:21,830
you know, chances are you go really deep.
So they go, well I would say eat a half.

992
01:00:22,130 --> 01:00:25,570
Don't listen to them.
Don't listen too much.

993
01:00:25,580 --> 01:00:28,790
This is a one ounce.
Oh man,

994
01:00:28,840 --> 01:00:31,160
no, just kidding. How are you guys
taking edibles? I just got back.

995
01:00:31,161 --> 01:00:31,730
What's happening?
Yeah.

996
01:00:31,730 --> 01:00:34,870
Yeah. Unfortunately I think we took
a little too much. Oh, do you want

997
01:00:36,340 --> 01:00:38,530
chocolate? No, I,

998
01:00:38,930 --> 01:00:43,880
I recently had a very troubling experience
with that. With an edible. Yeah.

999
01:00:43,881 --> 01:00:47,390
No, I don't really smoke weed that
often. Like I'll, I'll hang sometimes,

1000
01:00:47,391 --> 01:00:50,600
but I kind of just turned
into it an idiot. Right.

1001
01:00:50,760 --> 01:00:55,400
And when we were at Coachella,
my buddy gave me a jolly rancher and,

1002
01:00:55,460 --> 01:00:59,720
um, I, you know, never, I've rarely,

1003
01:00:59,721 --> 01:01:02,870
like maybe like every once in a while,
you know, smoke a little bit. Yeah.

1004
01:01:02,871 --> 01:01:05,230
And they were like, take
half. And I was like, well, I
can't really fucking bite it,

1005
01:01:05,231 --> 01:01:08,030
so I'll just take the whole thing.
I was so fucking high.

1006
01:01:08,280 --> 01:01:12,470
I was so excited to see Radiohead
for the first time. And I was, I was,

1007
01:01:12,620 --> 01:01:15,190
I was upfront, like thank God. Like they,

1008
01:01:15,210 --> 01:01:18,470
they did this incredible thing where they
gave you an artist viewing area and it

1009
01:01:18,471 --> 01:01:19,304
was right up front.

1010
01:01:19,520 --> 01:01:24,520
And I literally felt like I was floating
above them and I was freaking out.

1011
01:01:25,740 --> 01:01:28,730
Wow. It was amazing. Actually. You know
what? I'll be honest with you. I'll,

1012
01:01:28,731 --> 01:01:32,130
I'll totally out myself as a
girl. Um, how dare you. The,

1013
01:01:32,131 --> 01:01:36,950
the super fucking foxy dude from
true blood was standing next to me.

1014
01:01:36,951 --> 01:01:41,850
The the, which Werewolf? The Werewolf.
His name's Joe mentioned Leonoda Leo.

1015
01:01:44,980 --> 01:01:46,790
He's a beautiful man.
And you know,

1016
01:01:46,791 --> 01:01:50,150
you could tell he probably uses
a kettle ball bell, kettle bell.

1017
01:01:50,560 --> 01:01:55,040
So let's talk about his, his
incredible, um, and muscles.

1018
01:01:55,760 --> 01:01:59,390
No, I didn't meet him. I was just
high as a kite and I was by myself,

1019
01:01:59,391 --> 01:02:01,160
which was probably stupid on my part.

1020
01:02:01,161 --> 01:02:05,780
And I looked to my right and
he's standing next to me. I went,

1021
01:02:05,960 --> 01:02:10,850
oh my God. And then he looked
at me and I, no, you did.

1022
01:02:11,180 --> 01:02:13,740
Yes, I did. And then he
kind of slowly started.

1023
01:02:13,880 --> 01:02:17,630
I started to like drift through the
crowd and I was like, oh my God.

1024
01:02:17,631 --> 01:02:20,820
Like I've dreamed about this moment.
This is not how it's supposed to go.

1025
01:02:21,270 --> 01:02:24,510
It's supposed to involve a lot of other
things that are really exciting and

1026
01:02:24,511 --> 01:02:28,560
incredible and it didn't happen and
I was just mortified and how it,

1027
01:02:29,190 --> 01:02:30,870
yeah.
What a fucked up time to meet.

1028
01:02:30,900 --> 01:02:34,560
I hope that there are second
chances out there. Let me tell you,

1029
01:02:35,310 --> 01:02:39,390
but I found Ben and I was like, Ben,
you can meet me. I can't feel my face.

1030
01:02:40,460 --> 01:02:43,610
Yeah, you don't. If you don't get high
a lot, if you don't smoke a lot of pot,

1031
01:02:43,980 --> 01:02:47,030
you really shouldn't be fucking around
with those edibles. I'm just a boozer,

1032
01:02:47,090 --> 01:02:49,670
especially around like 100,000
people with cigarettes.

1033
01:02:50,400 --> 01:02:53,200
I think that's exactly very tricky.
It's very tricky.

1034
01:02:53,260 --> 01:02:57,250
Well, you know, you learn
your lesson and yeah,

1035
01:02:57,610 --> 01:03:01,840
I consider myself humbled by my
experiences at this past 2000 years and

1036
01:03:01,840 --> 01:03:05,200
12 Coachella. I've said this a
hundred times on the podcast,

1037
01:03:05,201 --> 01:03:08,590
but just in the interest of information,
when you eat it,

1038
01:03:08,860 --> 01:03:11,170
it's a totally different thing.
When you eat marijuana,

1039
01:03:11,171 --> 01:03:14,770
it's processed by your liver and it
produces something called 11 hydroxy

1040
01:03:14,771 --> 01:03:19,180
metabolite. This is like four to
five times more psychoactive den THC.

1041
01:03:19,630 --> 01:03:22,060
So that's what's going on.
So when you take it and you're like,

1042
01:03:22,061 --> 01:03:25,850
you don't feel high, you
feel like, like you're gone.

1043
01:03:26,410 --> 01:03:29,790
I felt like I was hallucinating.
I really did. Well it is, it is.

1044
01:03:29,840 --> 01:03:33,520
It looks like a dog. Shit was
happening. I was floating. Well,

1045
01:03:33,521 --> 01:03:37,180
if you closed your eyes too, you would
see amazing things behind your eyelids.

1046
01:03:37,181 --> 01:03:41,420
I mean, you see, um, I, I've, I've taken
in Gunton on planes before and you,

1047
01:03:41,421 --> 01:03:45,520
you have these, these shows where
it'll do this show under your eyelids.

1048
01:03:45,521 --> 01:03:49,030
Like you close your eyes and you
watched like neon cartoon things,

1049
01:03:49,031 --> 01:03:52,070
fuck each other and it's incredible.

1050
01:03:53,200 --> 01:03:57,990
Super Potent Shit. And it's, you know,
it's not the same thing as the smoking it.

1051
01:03:57,991 --> 01:04:01,510
It's a totally different experience and
it's not something you should just play

1052
01:04:01,511 --> 01:04:03,160
around with.
That's why those,

1053
01:04:03,161 --> 01:04:07,090
do you remember that I'm thing where the
cops stole some pot from some kids they

1054
01:04:07,091 --> 01:04:10,720
stole like in that pot round. No,
no real, it wasn't in the movie.

1055
01:04:10,721 --> 01:04:12,520
Super troopers in a real life situation.

1056
01:04:12,710 --> 01:04:15,580
When they called nine one one they
thought they were dying. Yeah.

1057
01:04:15,610 --> 01:04:18,090
They thought they had been poisoned.
They thought they were dying.

1058
01:04:18,100 --> 01:04:21,540
They thought they might be already dead.
Wait, I'm sorry. The cops, the cops did.

1059
01:04:21,541 --> 01:04:23,080
The cops took these kids.
We'd,

1060
01:04:23,081 --> 01:04:25,420
and then they ate it and then
they called nine one one.

1061
01:04:25,740 --> 01:04:28,690
The cops actually called nine one one
because they thought they were dying.

1062
01:04:28,990 --> 01:04:30,790
They were, they were freaking
out so bad. They look,

1063
01:04:30,810 --> 01:04:34,960
you got to call nine one one call them.
I'll call fuck it. I'm going to call.

1064
01:04:35,160 --> 01:04:37,970
It was just regular. No, they thought
they were poison or something. Brownies.

1065
01:04:38,080 --> 01:04:41,080
But I mean, do they eat them
because they're like, oh,
those look tasty. No, they,

1066
01:04:41,110 --> 01:04:41,740
they were,

1067
01:04:41,740 --> 01:04:46,180
they stole the kids pot and made pot
brownies and these fucking dummies didn't

1068
01:04:46,181 --> 01:04:48,190
know how to handle it.
They didn't know how to like,

1069
01:04:48,191 --> 01:04:52,050
didn't know what the dosage was. So then
they freak out and then they'd call it,

1070
01:04:52,090 --> 01:04:55,270
they call nine one one and they have to
fucking explain where they got all the

1071
01:04:55,271 --> 01:04:57,890
weed from. And what
happened. You crazy assholes.

1072
01:04:57,910 --> 01:05:02,170
They thought they were dead and you
can't get that high. You can get,

1073
01:05:02,171 --> 01:05:06,490
apparently eating hash is like the
nuttiest thing ever. And there's,

1074
01:05:06,580 --> 01:05:11,580
there's like ancient texts of like these
incredible psychedelic experience that

1075
01:05:12,161 --> 01:05:15,340
people experienced while they
were eating Hash, you know?

1076
01:05:15,341 --> 01:05:19,760
And so it was like who the, the of
a lot of their, you know, the I,

1077
01:05:19,770 --> 01:05:24,000
the idea of a, about the mystical
world, you know, was based on this,

1078
01:05:24,040 --> 01:05:27,700
this consumption of hash and
these crazy wild fucking trips.

1079
01:05:27,700 --> 01:05:32,290
They would go on these, it's
really similar to mushrooms,
animals when you hit,

1080
01:05:32,350 --> 01:05:35,380
when you eat a lot. Yeah. It gets
really similar. When you eat a lot,

1081
01:05:35,381 --> 01:05:40,350
it gets really similar, gets
it, gets really self examine
a Tori, you know, it's,

1082
01:05:40,351 --> 01:05:43,880
it's like great for clearing out
psychic baggage and you know,

1083
01:05:43,910 --> 01:05:45,670
exposing parts of your brain,

1084
01:05:45,671 --> 01:05:49,450
like think like people call it
insecure or they call it paranoid,

1085
01:05:49,630 --> 01:05:53,350
but really it's probably just
being aware, you know? I mean do,

1086
01:05:53,351 --> 01:05:55,790
you should kind of be freaking
out a little bit. You know,

1087
01:05:56,680 --> 01:05:58,000
we live in a crazy world.

1088
01:05:58,190 --> 01:06:01,670
It's kind of like after you have like
a really good cry and then after that

1089
01:06:01,671 --> 01:06:05,120
you're totally like, everything's cool.
You can handle whatever cause you're just,

1090
01:06:05,390 --> 01:06:09,700
he got it all out, you know, you're
too exhausted to bullshit. Yeah.

1091
01:06:09,740 --> 01:06:12,290
So you just have to be at,
at your truth.

1092
01:06:12,640 --> 01:06:15,860
Whoa. Yeah. Yeah. Dude. You know,

1093
01:06:17,090 --> 01:06:19,250
some of your best ideas come
when you're fucking exhausted.

1094
01:06:20,220 --> 01:06:23,470
Maybe that's what's good about how we
feel right now, Ben, because we're,

1095
01:06:23,520 --> 01:06:27,750
I feel like I,
I might spontaneously combust sometimes.

1096
01:06:28,900 --> 01:06:29,733
Yep.

1097
01:06:30,580 --> 01:06:34,900
Fucking businessman. Yeah. You guys
are super talented in a tough business.

1098
01:06:35,320 --> 01:06:39,790
You're in a weird spot. Thank you.
If you came along. No you are,

1099
01:06:39,791 --> 01:06:44,770
you're in a weird spot because if you
guys had come along like just a decade

1100
01:06:44,770 --> 01:06:47,830
earlier, it would have been a
real simple path to record sales.

1101
01:06:48,130 --> 01:06:49,990
A little bit of simple path to,
you know,

1102
01:06:49,991 --> 01:06:53,410
your own personal financial independence
just based on your art maybe, you know,

1103
01:06:53,411 --> 01:06:58,210
it's tough. I everyone is it like
there was some easy time. It never was.

1104
01:06:58,250 --> 01:06:59,920
I don't know if there was,
you know,

1105
01:06:59,921 --> 01:07:03,130
but I'm saying what I'm saying is that
at least you could sell records then.

1106
01:07:03,250 --> 01:07:06,670
Yeah, that's true. You can't sell
records anymore. You can, but the, the,

1107
01:07:06,671 --> 01:07:10,150
the amount that it's been
chewed down because of a,

1108
01:07:10,180 --> 01:07:12,580
I mean it's probably pretty
good with iTunes, you know,

1109
01:07:12,581 --> 01:07:16,320
but it's no where near what it used to
be. Not even close. What is the debt,

1110
01:07:16,360 --> 01:07:16,991
the damage,

1111
01:07:16,991 --> 01:07:21,250
like how much has the music industry
record sales and stuff you think been

1112
01:07:21,251 --> 01:07:22,450
damaged by the Internet?

1113
01:07:23,450 --> 01:07:23,631
Well,

1114
01:07:23,631 --> 01:07:27,560
I mean cds at basically killed cds and
that's what most of the structure has

1115
01:07:27,561 --> 01:07:30,200
been based around, you know,
all these distribution methods.

1116
01:07:30,210 --> 01:07:34,220
All these companies have built
themselves up around physical products,

1117
01:07:34,221 --> 01:07:35,620
but that doesn't really exist.
Right.

1118
01:07:35,621 --> 01:07:40,190
So now they're trying to adjust to these
digital sales methods and there isn't

1119
01:07:40,191 --> 01:07:41,780
like the framework,

1120
01:07:42,070 --> 01:07:45,460
right? So they have to invent it
on the fly and some companies fail

1121
01:07:45,580 --> 01:07:48,550
or they just do, they have to listen
to what iTunes tells him, you know?

1122
01:07:48,551 --> 01:07:50,380
Whereas before they were
kind of making up the rules.

1123
01:07:50,970 --> 01:07:54,510
Wow. That's crazy. How quickly it changed,
isn't it? You should talk about that.

1124
01:07:54,511 --> 01:07:58,230
Spotify thing was perfect. Oh
yeah, I heard they screw people.

1125
01:07:58,620 --> 01:08:00,840
What I heard Spotify has
been screwing artists.

1126
01:08:00,970 --> 01:08:04,300
Oh hell yeah. We've
got 9,400 on our, what?

1127
01:08:04,360 --> 01:08:07,420
We got another 300 out of five on our,
sometimes somebody told me,

1128
01:08:07,600 --> 01:08:11,940
somebody told me recently that Spotify
doesn't pay the artist for sure.

1129
01:08:12,190 --> 01:08:16,100
Don't barely at all at all. It's like
pennies on the dollar. And that's like

1130
01:08:16,100 --> 01:08:19,370
most internet things because it's trying
to figure out how you could possibly

1131
01:08:19,640 --> 01:08:24,140
offer this huge library of stuff to
somebody for like 10 bucks a month.

1132
01:08:24,500 --> 01:08:27,980
You know? Cause that's what people want to
pay. Right. Well, how could they do that?

1133
01:08:27,981 --> 01:08:32,390
Right. The idea is like that
that becomes like a, like a,

1134
01:08:32,540 --> 01:08:36,860
like a free trade radio sort of a
situation. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Hmm.

1135
01:08:37,410 --> 01:08:41,250
But I mean, here's the thing, it's like
I don't, I don't feel like, um, uh,

1136
01:08:41,340 --> 01:08:45,930
agro were malicious or angry towards
that mentality because, you know,

1137
01:08:45,931 --> 01:08:49,100
as long as people are listening,
that's great. Right. You know, but, um,

1138
01:08:49,380 --> 01:08:52,980
we're alive band at the core.
So when we're touring is when we're,

1139
01:08:52,981 --> 01:08:57,870
we're actually generating some sort of
income, which is great. Um, and you know,

1140
01:08:57,871 --> 01:09:01,020
but at this point it's like you have to
find these clever ways to try and make a

1141
01:09:01,021 --> 01:09:04,530
living. And I don't think
we're, I don't think we're far,

1142
01:09:04,531 --> 01:09:07,350
but like the reason we're doing this
Kickstarter account is cause we just want

1143
01:09:07,351 --> 01:09:08,250
that like that,

1144
01:09:08,520 --> 01:09:13,080
just a little bit of a leg up so we can
support the people that are around us

1145
01:09:13,230 --> 01:09:17,290
that are working very hard. You know,
it almost just as hard as we are and,

1146
01:09:17,300 --> 01:09:22,200
and then, you know, keep, keep the sort
of windfall ball rolling, you know,

1147
01:09:22,230 --> 01:09:26,160
that that can, you know, get to that place
where you're really sustained, you know,

1148
01:09:26,161 --> 01:09:29,400
and you're really, you're
really going. And um, you know,

1149
01:09:29,401 --> 01:09:31,890
at the end of the day we were talking
about how hard it is here and there and

1150
01:09:31,891 --> 01:09:33,860
like we're,
we're tired and um,

1151
01:09:33,900 --> 01:09:36,690
but like we made this choice
and we know that and I'm,

1152
01:09:36,750 --> 01:09:40,830
I wouldn't do anything else, you know,
unless I, if I'm doing this for 10 years,

1153
01:09:41,220 --> 01:09:44,190
but I don't, I don't think that's
going to happen, you know, hopefully.

1154
01:09:45,840 --> 01:09:47,310
But um,
you know,

1155
01:09:47,660 --> 01:09:49,760
you don't think what exactly
is going to happen in 10 years.

1156
01:09:49,761 --> 01:09:54,050
I'll have to find another job. You don't
ever have to find another job. Right.

1157
01:09:54,051 --> 01:09:58,580
I mean, isn't it all just about
more people seeing your stuff,

1158
01:09:58,581 --> 01:10:02,540
more people hearing your stuff. It's never
really about finding another job. Yeah.

1159
01:10:02,541 --> 01:10:06,170
You guys are slow build man. Yeah.
That's what it, it's a slow bill. That's,

1160
01:10:06,180 --> 01:10:08,450
I think that was the point.
I kind of don't ever really talk about,

1161
01:10:08,660 --> 01:10:11,900
you don't ever really think about
stopping this and finding another job.

1162
01:10:11,901 --> 01:10:16,010
Do you know it's all fucking
cry? No. Don't you cry Joe Rogan.

1163
01:10:16,640 --> 01:10:19,990
Derrick, have you guys thought, but
is it frustrating? Is that, yeah.

1164
01:10:20,420 --> 01:10:22,580
Yeah. I mean we're,
we're both, um, you know,

1165
01:10:22,581 --> 01:10:25,580
crashing with friends and stuff
like that. Like we, but that's okay.

1166
01:10:25,581 --> 01:10:29,750
Like that's part of being a musician.
It's like you don't get rich, you know,

1167
01:10:29,751 --> 01:10:31,310
quickly and you don't,
you know,

1168
01:10:31,311 --> 01:10:33,950
sometimes you never get rich and that
it's not about getting rich. We're,

1169
01:10:34,220 --> 01:10:38,960
we're trying to do what we love for a
living and, um, it's hard right now,

1170
01:10:38,990 --> 01:10:41,240
but, and you need a lot of
help from your friends. Like

1171
01:10:41,840 --> 01:10:46,730
in this day and age, artists make
the majority of their money touring.

1172
01:10:47,000 --> 01:10:51,800
So majority, either that or there's like
publishing channels, it's still exist.

1173
01:10:51,801 --> 01:10:56,060
If you get your stuff on a TV show TV,
there's actual money there.

1174
01:10:56,270 --> 01:10:58,850
But that's such a tiny
window, you know? So,

1175
01:10:58,970 --> 01:11:01,910
and what we're trying to do is just get
to a point where we can have the people

1176
01:11:01,911 --> 01:11:06,410
who support us really. Um, get to a
point where we can support ourselves.

1177
01:11:06,411 --> 01:11:11,090
You know what I mean? So it's a
really interesting concept. The uh,

1178
01:11:11,180 --> 01:11:14,370
the idea of like forming little
communities like that on the Internet,

1179
01:11:14,760 --> 01:11:16,650
you know, cause you know,
you're really, you're going to,

1180
01:11:16,660 --> 01:11:20,130
you reaching out to the people that
really enjoy your stuff and they want to

1181
01:11:20,131 --> 01:11:24,300
hear more of your stuff. Like you can
go right to them. Yeah. It's just you,

1182
01:11:24,330 --> 01:11:29,280
your voice, your little Kickstarter video,
right to them. No filter, no nothing.

1183
01:11:29,890 --> 01:11:34,230
Yeah, that was fun. So it was, it was,
have you really tested this patient?

1184
01:11:35,970 --> 01:11:39,540
What are you trying to do here?
In the end, it was really funny.

1185
01:11:39,541 --> 01:11:43,710
I really came together well, but
I was like, you guys are you guys,

1186
01:11:43,720 --> 01:11:48,460
you're on drugs not telling me the truth.
Oh,

1187
01:11:48,480 --> 01:11:52,140
that's amazing. I want to sit in
front of a camera and be like,

1188
01:11:52,141 --> 01:11:55,790
this is what we want to do.
Right. Well, you know, you guys,

1189
01:11:57,180 --> 01:12:00,310
you guys are silly, but it's
good to be solid. You know,

1190
01:12:00,460 --> 01:12:03,940
keep too many people are trying
too hard to be cool. You know,

1191
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:05,200
you're way better off being silly.

1192
01:12:06,030 --> 01:12:10,540
Substitute Chili's fun so he's fun.

1193
01:12:10,541 --> 01:12:13,750
Serious is annoying.
That was a important moment.

1194
01:12:13,751 --> 01:12:16,450
I think when we realized as Joe was
watching it, it's like, oh wait,

1195
01:12:16,451 --> 01:12:18,660
we made a movie with a dunk.
Feels

1196
01:12:20,310 --> 01:12:24,210
like what the fuck is with the lipstick
on the cheeks and it's a rooster.

1197
01:12:24,420 --> 01:12:28,950
Are you guys doing your chicken
Brewster thing? Hey Brian,

1198
01:12:28,951 --> 01:12:29,784
we're never going to

1199
01:12:29,870 --> 01:12:33,020
put oil on that door. You know why?
Because people are complaining about it.

1200
01:12:33,220 --> 01:12:37,540
Are they really a myth? So can you
please put some Debbie d 40 on that door.

1201
01:12:37,920 --> 01:12:40,250
It's a fucking door man.
Do you trip?

1202
01:12:40,290 --> 01:12:43,510
And we are in your house and you have a
conversation and somebody opens up the

1203
01:12:43,511 --> 01:12:48,190
door. Do you trip? Do you go, what the
fuck mom? Grow Up. You little baby.

1204
01:12:48,840 --> 01:12:52,060
So the door squeaks.
Who Cares?

1205
01:12:52,920 --> 01:12:57,580
So many people can be so negative
assholes experiencing a lot of love on the

1206
01:12:57,581 --> 01:12:58,790
road though I got up,

1207
01:12:58,810 --> 01:13:01,450
I saw a lot of positive tweets
about people they went to see you.

1208
01:13:01,460 --> 01:13:02,830
I saw a lot of that.

1209
01:13:03,070 --> 01:13:08,000
We've got so much Rogan love, honestly,
like every single place we went and that,

1210
01:13:08,001 --> 01:13:10,510
this is no joke. It's like
there'd be at least if there were,

1211
01:13:10,511 --> 01:13:13,510
if it was a small night, there'd be like
five or 10 people that came from this,

1212
01:13:13,511 --> 01:13:18,190
but like in every city,
awesome. 40 to 50% of fans from,

1213
01:13:18,220 --> 01:13:21,410
from you, which was really cool.
Cincinnati, it was a huge, yeah.

1214
01:13:22,350 --> 01:13:25,060
That's so awesome to hear
those Ohio people are great.

1215
01:13:25,110 --> 01:13:26,860
The fan base in Ohio is huge.

1216
01:13:26,861 --> 01:13:29,750
That's why we need to go back
to [inaudible] after the show.

1217
01:13:30,900 --> 01:13:33,270
They need to go to Cleveland
to, yeah, it's a good town.

1218
01:13:33,350 --> 01:13:37,810
I did Cleveland with Charlie
Murphy. Oh, nice venue.

1219
01:13:38,530 --> 01:13:39,940
I forget.
It was one of the comedy

1220
01:13:39,970 --> 01:13:43,860
clubs. It was, um, man, I don't
remember which one it was.

1221
01:13:44,270 --> 01:13:47,480
It might've been the Improv if
there's an Improv there, right? No,

1222
01:13:47,490 --> 01:13:51,470
it was the hilarity. It's or something.
I don't remember. Sorry. I did a,

1223
01:13:51,770 --> 01:13:55,800
I did a tour with Charlie Murphy
and we did like 22 cities.

1224
01:13:56,360 --> 01:14:00,480
Yeah. And it was a month.
So it was like constant. You
never knew where you were. So

1225
01:14:01,370 --> 01:14:06,110
that's crazy. Yeah. I did
grog shop with Joey is,

1226
01:14:06,800 --> 01:14:10,000
what is that? It's grog shop. That's
where me and Joey Diaz went uh,

1227
01:14:10,100 --> 01:14:11,940
last month or two ago or whatever.
That's

1228
01:14:12,120 --> 01:14:15,520
the club you went? Yeah. And is that
Columbus or Cleveland? I was in Cleveland,

1229
01:14:15,521 --> 01:14:17,890
but yeah. So you guys went to like
a rock club or something like that?

1230
01:14:18,100 --> 01:14:21,490
It was like a, I think they do
both, but I think it's mostly music.

1231
01:14:21,790 --> 01:14:24,460
But it was cool. It was a nice
little place. Next set up dude.

1232
01:14:24,530 --> 01:14:29,170
I penises on the walls every time we
played there and my family's there.

1233
01:14:29,171 --> 01:14:33,100
I'm just Kinda like Ah, cause he's turning
penis isn't that? It's great. Yeah.

1234
01:14:33,110 --> 01:14:38,080
And yeah, it's like, it used to be a
real grunge kind of punk bar, you know,

1235
01:14:38,110 --> 01:14:41,440
rock and let me get in there and we play.
Or like folk rock,

1236
01:14:41,441 --> 01:14:44,920
blues music and it's fine.
You make it work.

1237
01:14:45,630 --> 01:14:49,300
Did you ever run into like a stumbling
block where people didn't want to hear

1238
01:14:49,301 --> 01:14:50,290
that kind of music?

1239
01:14:50,320 --> 01:14:53,770
Do you ever in a situation where like
nobody knows who you are and you want to

1240
01:14:53,771 --> 01:14:57,520
go and do your stuff and for whatever
reason people like heckle or act

1241
01:14:57,521 --> 01:14:59,740
negatively.
We've been so lucky man.

1242
01:14:59,741 --> 01:15:03,910
I feel like we played in
all these situations where
we're completely different

1243
01:15:03,911 --> 01:15:07,150
that we've opened for a lot of headliners
that we don't sound anything like and

1244
01:15:07,151 --> 01:15:12,151
no one's ever really put us down and I've
got this arsenal of comebacks that I'm

1245
01:15:12,731 --> 01:15:16,990
ready for it to be like to throw out at
that one guy who's being a dick and I

1246
01:15:16,991 --> 01:15:21,280
can't use them. Guess where you
guys, it's pretty nice to you guys.

1247
01:15:21,670 --> 01:15:25,450
You guys are creepy. I'm not inviting
anyone to be a jerk. Please love us.

1248
01:15:26,290 --> 01:15:29,590
You guys are creepy talented. You
guys are really good. You guys are,

1249
01:15:30,220 --> 01:15:33,460
you know when we went to see you
live I was like, this is like,

1250
01:15:33,610 --> 01:15:37,420
it's crazy that you can watch someone
like that close, like singing,

1251
01:15:37,600 --> 01:15:39,970
like it's such a different
experience when you're in a club.

1252
01:15:40,780 --> 01:15:44,640
I guess it's probably the same as
a, as a comic too. Like when you're,

1253
01:15:44,650 --> 01:15:48,640
you're in front of like a tight group of
a few hundred people just jammed into a

1254
01:15:48,641 --> 01:15:52,840
place that really is like the best
scenario, like the best kind of show.

1255
01:15:53,080 --> 01:15:56,140
It was so powerful. It was
like, wow, this is wild.

1256
01:15:56,590 --> 01:16:00,640
I am fascinated by music cause I
can't do it at all. So I'm like,

1257
01:16:00,790 --> 01:16:02,290
I'm watching you guys do magic.

1258
01:16:03,630 --> 01:16:06,580
You're putting together songs and you're
playing instruments to me. I'm like,

1259
01:16:06,581 --> 01:16:09,940
you're, you're doing magic. Like I can't
do that. I can't do anything with it.

1260
01:16:09,941 --> 01:16:13,930
So it's uh, it's amazing. It's so
fascinating. It's a, it's really

1261
01:16:16,510 --> 01:16:19,900
just to throw it back, it's like we
have a set list and we have this like,

1262
01:16:20,630 --> 01:16:23,230
you know,
rarely do you have to go off book,

1263
01:16:23,290 --> 01:16:27,370
quote unquote like every once in a while
you get a heckler. But we like people,

1264
01:16:27,371 --> 01:16:31,120
we like to hang, you know what's fine
hackleback and then you do your thing.

1265
01:16:31,120 --> 01:16:33,790
But like, you know, with comedy,
I feel like when you get,

1266
01:16:34,270 --> 01:16:36,980
you also have a sort of set list,
you know,

1267
01:16:37,180 --> 01:16:39,880
so to speak or your material
that you have planned.

1268
01:16:40,660 --> 01:16:45,660
But the off the cuff kind of stuff and
it's kind of terrifying because you can't

1269
01:16:47,050 --> 01:16:51,820
have a low in your comedic set like you
can when you're tuning your guitar in a

1270
01:16:51,821 --> 01:16:56,660
musical set. Yeah. Nobody wants to win
while you get your shit together. Exactly.

1271
01:16:56,800 --> 01:17:01,640
Don't
exactly what the joke there.

1272
01:17:01,790 --> 01:17:05,530
They need to be stimulated like
almost to the second. Yeah.

1273
01:17:05,560 --> 01:17:09,230
But it's still way easier then when
you guys do, I don't have to work this

1274
01:17:12,130 --> 01:17:13,240
video because you have,

1275
01:17:13,260 --> 01:17:16,700
I'm pretty sure there's a Joe Rogan and
Brian Redman is for parents in there.

1276
01:17:17,320 --> 01:17:19,830
It was great. It turned
out so great. Thank you.

1277
01:17:20,480 --> 01:17:24,050
We're so excited and it was awesome.
Really Weird. Sing a lot of it.

1278
01:17:26,020 --> 01:17:30,050
Yeah. And then seeing them because I think
we need to see their scene. Oh, you did.

1279
01:17:30,080 --> 01:17:31,130
Oh, that's awesome. Yeah,

1280
01:17:31,131 --> 01:17:34,670
so it was really cool to see like if
these people that I talk to all day,

1281
01:17:38,700 --> 01:17:42,600
not to be totally graphic, but he
said, I'm going to, I'm going to come.

1282
01:17:42,670 --> 01:17:45,320
Doesn't that, that's what he said.
He did that on purpose. He was like,

1283
01:17:45,321 --> 01:17:49,760
I'm just going to explore what they're
good for.

1284
01:17:49,761 --> 01:17:53,570
You Martin. And then the pastor dude
was really cool. Yeah, I guess he,

1285
01:17:53,580 --> 01:17:56,900
he just does it like, oh, there's
a Jason Ritter who was awesome.

1286
01:17:57,090 --> 01:18:00,870
Do you hang out with him that day?
He's a sweet dude.

1287
01:18:02,640 --> 01:18:06,930
Why did you kill him? I don't know.
Because he, he, he wasn't, uh,

1288
01:18:07,320 --> 01:18:12,180
he didn't love me enough. That was
funny when he did the zipper part.

1289
01:18:12,310 --> 01:18:16,200
That was, that was perfect, man.

1290
01:18:16,201 --> 01:18:18,810
He thought he was going to get
some and then that's how bitches,

1291
01:18:19,060 --> 01:18:23,960
oh, so you've been getting
a lot of road booty.

1292
01:18:23,961 --> 01:18:28,080
I mean, are you a, do you have a lot of
guy fans that are right at the point?

1293
01:18:28,700 --> 01:18:31,400
Brian?
Brian,

1294
01:18:31,460 --> 01:18:34,490
let's talk about your girlfriends and
then I'll talk about my boyfriends. No,

1295
01:18:34,491 --> 01:18:35,570
don't talk about his girl.

1296
01:18:36,130 --> 01:18:40,430
It's not clearly one of them had a tail.

1297
01:18:40,431 --> 01:18:43,550
Like a literal tails. No,
no, no. Please, please.

1298
01:18:44,030 --> 01:18:44,863
Just kidding.

1299
01:18:46,520 --> 01:18:51,410
I'm sure they're beautiful and
lovely and very smart. I, uh,

1300
01:18:51,411 --> 01:18:53,420
I'm single. Are you really? Yeah.

1301
01:18:53,570 --> 01:18:55,850
Shizam son.
That was a message.

1302
01:18:55,870 --> 01:18:59,590
Sure. Well, what do you do?
Radio Kurt? Green Light.

1303
01:18:59,960 --> 01:19:04,730
Do you want to hang out with queen honey?
Yes, I do. [inaudible] rumble, honey,

1304
01:19:04,731 --> 01:19:09,480
honey and Jack. Then just six kids to pass
the bottle and the ice. Let's get shit.

1305
01:19:11,140 --> 01:19:14,470
Oh my God. How many days
when you guys go on the road,

1306
01:19:14,471 --> 01:19:18,400
how many days do you go for like what's a,
what's a long two months?

1307
01:19:18,401 --> 01:19:20,280
As long as we've got two months.
I think

1308
01:19:20,710 --> 01:19:23,590
we did a couple of those, but yeah, man,

1309
01:19:23,591 --> 01:19:25,840
it's been like for the
past year and a half,

1310
01:19:26,200 --> 01:19:28,150
we haven't taken more than like three,

1311
01:19:28,151 --> 01:19:31,150
four maybe we've taken four
weeks off at one point.

1312
01:19:31,330 --> 01:19:35,620
But since then it's just been
constant, which has been, I mean it's,

1313
01:19:35,621 --> 01:19:39,010
it's amazing like she said, but
it's disorienting too, you know?

1314
01:19:39,080 --> 01:19:43,710
Well, so fascinating because you guys are
so talented and you know, it's, I'm, I'm,

1315
01:19:43,740 --> 01:19:48,500
I'm getting to watch like this
whole, uh, emergence of you. Like,

1316
01:19:48,501 --> 01:19:51,080
you know,
you're going on this tour,

1317
01:19:51,380 --> 01:19:53,750
getting all your shit on the internet
and it's growing. It's, it's,

1318
01:19:53,900 --> 01:19:56,210
it's fascinating to
watch. It really is. Yeah.

1319
01:19:56,590 --> 01:20:00,820
Cool. Yeah. It's you cool to see.
Yeah, you can see numbers built.

1320
01:20:01,020 --> 01:20:04,870
That's the different, is kind of where it
used to be. Like when my space came out,

1321
01:20:05,080 --> 01:20:07,920
all of a sudden you had these numbers,
that's signs of things.

1322
01:20:08,010 --> 01:20:10,460
Right?
But you sure right and didn't it,

1323
01:20:10,500 --> 01:20:14,030
you guys do it by youtube is like your
youtube numbers, is that what it is? Um,

1324
01:20:15,230 --> 01:20:19,470
Facebook and Twitter, he's spoken Twitter,
you know, the, the angel of death video.

1325
01:20:19,471 --> 01:20:22,680
We're kind of waiting for this to
hit some sort of swing cause it's,

1326
01:20:22,950 --> 01:20:26,940
it really is such a great video.
And um, but essentially it is,

1327
01:20:27,000 --> 01:20:30,250
it is Twitter and
Facebook, but you know, um,

1328
01:20:30,990 --> 01:20:33,510
we're trying to try and make
as many videos as we can.

1329
01:20:34,050 --> 01:20:37,290
Farm animals still a death video
is still you guys on that roof.

1330
01:20:37,860 --> 01:20:39,660
That's how I found out
about you. This, this,

1331
01:20:39,720 --> 01:20:42,050
this dude on my message board named balls.
Yeah.

1332
01:20:42,150 --> 01:20:45,330
Yeah. Balls of steel. Where as
long as he's out there somewhere,

1333
01:20:45,331 --> 01:20:48,270
he was super psyched when we were
talking about him on the podcast.

1334
01:20:48,271 --> 01:20:52,320
He sent me a message. Um, Gosh, well yeah,
that one where you guys were on the roof.

1335
01:20:52,321 --> 01:20:55,680
That is a fucking, I love
that one. That's my favorite.

1336
01:20:58,210 --> 01:21:01,800
That was like, this is so interesting.
This guy sent me a message. He goes,

1337
01:21:01,801 --> 01:21:05,780
this is your new favorite
band. Wow, man. What a guy.

1338
01:21:06,930 --> 01:21:08,430
We're going to find you balls of steel.

1339
01:21:10,410 --> 01:21:14,570
How Bob Dylan do you look
right there and son, you look,

1340
01:21:15,090 --> 01:21:16,800
you look mad. Bob Dylan, their kid

1341
01:21:24,370 --> 01:21:28,640
right there. I got hugs. Yeah,
that's it. I'm done. Oh Man. Sorry.

1342
01:21:28,980 --> 01:21:29,813
I remember that.
Yeah,

1343
01:21:29,980 --> 01:21:33,560
no, no. Now we're now that we're
buddies, you know, the first time,

1344
01:21:34,690 --> 01:21:37,670
you know when we found out
that you liked art music,

1345
01:21:38,120 --> 01:21:41,390
we had this weird day where
all of a sudden I was like,

1346
01:21:41,660 --> 01:21:45,440
I didn't really know how to use Twitter.
And actually because of of y'all,

1347
01:21:45,470 --> 01:21:48,110
we kind of really hopped on board to,
you know,

1348
01:21:48,111 --> 01:21:50,390
really work in the Twitter circuit.

1349
01:21:50,690 --> 01:21:53,570
But all of a sudden our Twitter
accounts kind of going crazy.

1350
01:21:53,571 --> 01:21:56,180
And then someone's like, Joe Rogan
tweeted at you. I was like, really?

1351
01:21:56,181 --> 01:21:57,350
I was like the guy from Mexico.

1352
01:21:57,430 --> 01:22:00,460
Sure. That's awesome. And,

1353
01:22:00,780 --> 01:22:03,650
and then I, I really did my
research, my research and I,

1354
01:22:03,710 --> 01:22:06,810
I listened to your podcast that you did.

1355
01:22:07,110 --> 01:22:11,690
And it was so funny because it was like,
he said the nicest things and is,

1356
01:22:11,760 --> 01:22:13,260
it was so flattering.
And he said, you know,

1357
01:22:13,261 --> 01:22:15,480
listen to this girl's
voice and you're just like,

1358
01:22:15,481 --> 01:22:18,000
God talking about these really
beautiful things. And then you're like,

1359
01:22:18,180 --> 01:22:19,930
do Rogan experience
sponsored by the flesh.

1360
01:22:19,970 --> 01:22:23,570
Right. I was like, I was amazing.

1361
01:22:23,870 --> 01:22:28,470
It was so cool because this was our
first podcast we've ever done. And,

1362
01:22:28,550 --> 01:22:32,030
and since then we've done a couple
more, which has been really cool. Um,

1363
01:22:32,120 --> 01:22:34,310
but you're,
you're a podcast champion.

1364
01:22:35,190 --> 01:22:39,650
You guys cool. You did. Dunkin's Oh my
God. Don't give them, wasn't in the shit.

1365
01:22:39,710 --> 01:22:43,630
Yeah. And he's become one of our friends
too, and he's special. We love him.

1366
01:22:43,631 --> 01:22:47,460
I love the fuck out of that dude. Him
and Brian are feuding though. Oh No,

1367
01:22:47,461 --> 01:22:49,580
I love the fuck out here. The roof. Oh,

1368
01:22:49,890 --> 01:22:52,950
I love the fuck out of both of them
separately. I have two right now.

1369
01:22:53,820 --> 01:22:58,110
Nobody's taken sides. Will get in
the middle of that. No, no, no, no.

1370
01:22:58,111 --> 01:23:01,950
Split of the rift. Please. You hear like,

1371
01:23:02,310 --> 01:23:06,040
you're either like shitty things are you
like, hey, how dare you? How dare you. How

1372
01:23:06,040 --> 01:23:08,570
dare you? Oh, apparently I like
both. I don't know who is who

1373
01:23:10,950 --> 01:23:14,620
should. We have an intervention
now, so that'll be, that'll be fine.

1374
01:23:14,650 --> 01:23:18,430
It's really minor detail. I'm only
reminded of it when Joe brings it up.

1375
01:23:18,490 --> 01:23:19,780
I'm sorry,
I didn't mean to,

1376
01:23:20,170 --> 01:23:23,420
I just had to because we were talking
about how awesome Dunkin as I feel like I

1377
01:23:23,421 --> 01:23:28,110
have to staff to say we can't talk too
nice about him because Brian and hammer

1378
01:23:28,120 --> 01:23:32,110
feuding sort of metaphysical way.
They're going to get over it eventually.

1379
01:23:33,470 --> 01:23:37,060
We're going to do ecstasy together and
then they'll be fine. They'll hug it out.

1380
01:23:40,720 --> 01:23:42,430
I'll pass that.
So weird sandwich

1381
01:23:45,180 --> 01:23:47,860
blacked out. I don't even know
what like whip cream and hot sauce.

1382
01:23:47,861 --> 01:23:51,070
I don't know if you know what
you want to put those together.

1383
01:23:51,330 --> 01:23:55,320
That sounds like you could
get an infection of cream
and hot sauce and I told

1384
01:23:55,340 --> 01:23:59,930
her you shouldn't put get
something chocolate up there.

1385
01:24:00,160 --> 01:24:04,430
No, you shouldn't keep it natural. No,

1386
01:24:06,540 --> 01:24:08,050
I have had friends who have done,

1387
01:24:09,820 --> 01:24:13,420
I think shit gets really messed up from
like from like beauty magazines like

1388
01:24:13,421 --> 01:24:16,000
cosmo. It's like, how to
please your man, you know,

1389
01:24:16,190 --> 01:24:20,230
with all this bullshit of like skirting
from what just feels right and you know,

1390
01:24:20,231 --> 01:24:24,730
being in a relationship or not,
or just being sexually confident,

1391
01:24:25,360 --> 01:24:25,870
but like,

1392
01:24:25,870 --> 01:24:30,730
you know people that bust out the
food part and then rub it on things.

1393
01:24:30,731 --> 01:24:33,810
You gotta be careful with that.
I don't know. Oh, like with sex,

1394
01:24:33,980 --> 01:24:37,120
if I was getting on some
dude and he's like, hold on,

1395
01:24:39,010 --> 01:24:41,380
I'm going to put some
whipped cream on her twinkle.

1396
01:24:43,270 --> 01:24:48,270
Zam it sounds like really uncomfortable
and stickies try it looks a problem.

1397
01:24:50,420 --> 01:24:53,770
It would just cause problems. You know
what I mean? Maybe not though. Maybe.

1398
01:24:53,771 --> 01:24:58,270
Awesome.
Want to just give me a massage,

1399
01:24:59,230 --> 01:25:03,070
but better yet. Let's just, let's just
go to chick fil a and call it a day. Wow.

1400
01:25:03,880 --> 01:25:07,990
It's either that or the highway. I guess
you've made your, you stay in your claim.

1401
01:25:07,991 --> 01:25:11,080
They'll cream.
Put Food on my special place.

1402
01:25:13,200 --> 01:25:17,350
Yeah. No, no, no
chick-fil-a, no food at all.

1403
01:25:17,351 --> 01:25:21,370
She's baked. That's the, that's the
abandonment movies. Go to chick fil a.

1404
01:25:21,371 --> 01:25:23,290
Let's forget the whole
thing. This is plan B. Now.

1405
01:25:23,440 --> 01:25:24,910
Maybe I'm just a traditional girl.

1406
01:25:24,911 --> 01:25:29,230
I just like to get down the regular
way without food. I agree with you.

1407
01:25:29,500 --> 01:25:31,450
No need to bring in cherries.
Mickey Rourke.

1408
01:25:33,390 --> 01:25:37,750
You remember that movie? Was it? And
what was it? Nine and a half weeks.

1409
01:25:37,751 --> 01:25:40,420
What was the movie with Mickey Rourke
and Kim? Basically one and a half weeks.

1410
01:25:40,421 --> 01:25:43,720
Is that what it was one of the first
movies ever master. Okay. Am I that?

1411
01:25:43,721 --> 01:25:48,680
I know the name of that.
Um, pretty good. Um, yeah,

1412
01:25:48,730 --> 01:25:49,171
it was a,

1413
01:25:49,171 --> 01:25:52,480
it's like a real sexual movie and they
did a lot of like food stuff and there

1414
01:25:52,481 --> 01:25:57,481
was like some when Kim based
your Wa oh it's hot as fuck.

1415
01:25:58,420 --> 01:26:01,540
She was so hot back then.
It was stupid. And you know,

1416
01:26:01,541 --> 01:26:04,010
and when her and man one works well,
he's

1417
01:26:04,010 --> 01:26:07,070
like kissing her and their,
he's feeding her grapes and shit.

1418
01:26:07,100 --> 01:26:10,600
Or after he reconstructed
his face way before. Well he,

1419
01:26:10,601 --> 01:26:14,600
you know what happened with him? He
started a box. That's right. My bad.

1420
01:26:14,601 --> 01:26:17,840
I stand corrected. Well, no, he
did have some like face work done,

1421
01:26:18,080 --> 01:26:19,380
but I think some of it really,

1422
01:26:19,640 --> 01:26:23,100
some of it was a little bit of
reconstructive stuff. He got, he got like,

1423
01:26:23,450 --> 01:26:25,490
he had like real problems apparently.

1424
01:26:25,491 --> 01:26:29,030
I read in some interview with
his get like neurological tests,

1425
01:26:29,031 --> 01:26:32,570
like the chats on them. They was like,
you have to stop boxing like you're,

1426
01:26:32,571 --> 01:26:35,870
you're having like brain issues.
So he had to stop.

1427
01:26:35,871 --> 01:26:37,970
But I mean the guy went from crazy,

1428
01:26:38,090 --> 01:26:42,890
went from being a fucking huge movie
star to being a boxer to back to being a

1429
01:26:42,891 --> 01:26:43,724
movie star yet.

1430
01:26:44,270 --> 01:26:48,560
Like that's a weird bond and
professionally and fighting the deal guys.

1431
01:26:48,860 --> 01:26:50,900
He was a boxing real people.
I mean they weren't,

1432
01:26:50,930 --> 01:26:53,210
they didn't set them up with like
some of the best guys in the world,

1433
01:26:53,300 --> 01:26:57,380
but they set them up with some good
fighters. Like he fought some boxers.

1434
01:26:57,410 --> 01:26:59,540
That's another backup of honey.
Honey doesn't work out.

1435
01:26:59,541 --> 01:27:03,200
It's either the brothel in Nevada
or boxing. People are always like,

1436
01:27:03,210 --> 01:27:07,640
because foot soak like Wilson, he's a
fucking actor. He's a goddamn movie star.

1437
01:27:07,730 --> 01:27:11,270
He fought real people. It was a
real food. You also wanted a box.

1438
01:27:11,450 --> 01:27:13,940
It's not like he's out there fighting
sugar ray Leonard or something. Okay.

1439
01:27:13,941 --> 01:27:18,530
It's like what a crazy Guy Mickey
Rourke was. That's a wild ass mood.

1440
01:27:19,460 --> 01:27:21,800
Did he win any bounce or
anything? Yeah. Yeah I did.

1441
01:27:21,801 --> 01:27:24,730
Well I think you won so many law.
I don't really remember his record.

1442
01:27:24,740 --> 01:27:28,460
I mean I remember watching him box wants
them so it was a real fight. You know,

1443
01:27:28,461 --> 01:27:30,050
he's really fucking boxing.

1444
01:27:30,060 --> 01:27:32,720
Some guy went from being a movie
star to being a fucking boxer.

1445
01:27:32,721 --> 01:27:36,140
He's getting punched in the face and
shit. You little whoa. This is legit.

1446
01:27:37,070 --> 01:27:40,710
I mean again, it wasn't fighting. The best
guys they do really was fighting. Yeah.

1447
01:27:40,760 --> 01:27:44,290
He must have been like a
heavyweight. Yeah, I met him
at a, one of the UFC. He's a,

1448
01:27:44,330 --> 01:27:47,480
he's probably a pretty big guy. He looks
like he's in really good shape. He got,

1449
01:27:47,690 --> 01:27:52,400
he got really big for that.
Um, that wrestler movie. He
did. Remember that movie?

1450
01:27:52,520 --> 01:27:55,160
What do you guys got in there?
They are looking for getting crazy.

1451
01:27:56,650 --> 01:28:01,160
I'm feeling a little warm. Do you
want a water? I'm good. I'm good.

1452
01:28:01,161 --> 01:28:02,630
I'm sticking with my eco vessel.

1453
01:28:03,050 --> 01:28:08,050
What does that well too to sort of
reduce on the plastic pollution.

1454
01:28:08,980 --> 01:28:12,380
Right, but it's got a little
filter in it and we take,

1455
01:28:12,470 --> 01:28:16,670
I take it on the road with me so I could
drink river water out of this thing.

1456
01:28:17,060 --> 01:28:18,400
I know I'm,
wow.

1457
01:28:19,040 --> 01:28:22,550
I think we're going to go full circle
and then we'll come back to deer skins.

1458
01:28:22,970 --> 01:28:26,420
I'm down. You going to be glad. When I
get my food with a bow and Arrow ladder,

1459
01:28:27,470 --> 01:28:31,640
I watched those shows. I watch those
shows on like the outdoorsman channel.

1460
01:28:32,330 --> 01:28:36,320
It's a shoot pigs of the
bone deadwood. It's like this
is, that's, that's where we,

1461
01:28:36,321 --> 01:28:39,420
that's those are our ancestors. Well,
it's weird when you shit went down.

1462
01:28:39,760 --> 01:28:43,460
That was how everybody had to live
just a couple of hundred years ago.

1463
01:28:43,490 --> 01:28:46,610
There's no other options. This is what,
this is the way it was. That's it.

1464
01:28:47,420 --> 01:28:52,160
Go out and kill animals. Have
you ever gone hunting Joe?
No. I'm going soon though.

1465
01:28:52,760 --> 01:28:54,530
Yes. Yeah. Yeah. I used
to go fishing a lot.

1466
01:28:54,620 --> 01:28:58,760
What type of delicate form of going
hunting for deer. Really check this out.

1467
01:28:58,761 --> 01:29:02,250
This is kind of fucked up.
Uh, Los Angeles just banned

1468
01:29:02,250 --> 01:29:06,190
all marijuana dispensaries.
Shit.

1469
01:29:06,800 --> 01:29:11,770
So true. How did they just posted
this? How has that Po, is that, wait,

1470
01:29:11,850 --> 01:29:15,720
where are you reading that?
It says the Los Angeles City Council.

1471
01:29:15,721 --> 01:29:18,780
It has just voted to ban all
medical marijuana dispensaries.

1472
01:29:19,590 --> 01:29:23,640
Council member Paul Cortez was the
only person to vote against the ban.

1473
01:29:24,390 --> 01:29:25,340
Um,

1474
01:29:26,270 --> 01:29:30,540
this exemptions will allow patients to
continue growing marijuana for their own

1475
01:29:30,541 --> 01:29:34,560
use and primary caregivers may
continue to distribute the drug.

1476
01:29:35,130 --> 01:29:37,880
So don't worry about the cancer patients.
They'll be fine as cities,

1477
01:29:37,950 --> 01:29:39,420
physicians to find a dealer.

1478
01:29:39,870 --> 01:29:43,450
Um, so this is just within
the city of Los Angeles. I,

1479
01:29:43,600 --> 01:29:45,990
I'm not 100% sure right now,

1480
01:29:47,280 --> 01:29:51,000
but that's Kinda Kinda fucked.
That's pretty crazy.

1481
01:29:52,200 --> 01:29:54,430
I wonder if like that, like the, the, the,

1482
01:29:54,440 --> 01:29:57,660
the people that like la speed
weed that aren't a dispensary,

1483
01:29:57,661 --> 01:30:02,280
but they can deliver it. It's pointless.
Like why, why, why, why is this happening?

1484
01:30:02,310 --> 01:30:04,950
You know, it's like, give me
the logic, show me the numbers.

1485
01:30:05,130 --> 01:30:06,300
Show me where somebody is getting hurt.

1486
01:30:06,301 --> 01:30:11,250
Why are any resources being
spent in this way so, so silly?

1487
01:30:11,530 --> 01:30:14,190
Well, I wonder if, um, that's so cray one,

1488
01:30:14,790 --> 01:30:18,510
is there much government regulation
on the dispensary's because you know,

1489
01:30:18,511 --> 01:30:22,470
as far as like taxation purposes like
isn't, I mean California is broke.

1490
01:30:23,670 --> 01:30:24,740
They could certainly use the money.

1491
01:30:24,780 --> 01:30:28,180
Perhaps they want to come back with
their own spin on things. That's,

1492
01:30:28,200 --> 01:30:30,450
I don't think that's what's
going on. I think, uh, it's,

1493
01:30:30,500 --> 01:30:33,390
it's one business pushing on
another business. There's no,

1494
01:30:33,420 --> 01:30:37,530
there's no logical reason for them to
be trying to go after these people.

1495
01:30:37,640 --> 01:30:40,320
It doesn't make any sense. It's not
like you're trying to protect society,

1496
01:30:41,340 --> 01:30:44,490
excuse me, protect society from
marijuana. I mean there's no,

1497
01:30:44,491 --> 01:30:48,330
there's no science or numbers to back
that up. It doesn't make any sense.

1498
01:30:48,331 --> 01:30:52,200
Especially while you're selling liquor
at the liquor store and the drugs at cvs,

1499
01:30:52,201 --> 01:30:55,650
it's like to say that you're going to
spend any resources to stop marijuana at

1500
01:30:55,651 --> 01:30:59,790
all those, it's crazy. It's like I
don't care if that's been there already.

1501
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:03,060
You're showing me something that exists
right now and then in a liquor store

1502
01:31:03,210 --> 01:31:07,860
that's far more dangerous than some
marijuana, and you're saying that's okay.

1503
01:31:08,550 --> 01:31:12,000
Fuck yet is more dangerous to your body.
More destructive,

1504
01:31:12,030 --> 01:31:15,000
more dangerous for social behavior,
more dangerous for driving,

1505
01:31:15,001 --> 01:31:18,640
more dangerous for almost the buzz right
now. Don't ruin this for me. I like,

1506
01:31:18,810 --> 01:31:20,820
I'd like booze,
but it's just we,

1507
01:31:20,870 --> 01:31:25,650
it's nonsense that we would allow
them to use any resources to stop pot.

1508
01:31:25,750 --> 01:31:26,790
It doesn't make any sense.

1509
01:31:27,000 --> 01:31:30,450
There's no reason why you would go after
that when you haven't fixed all the

1510
01:31:30,451 --> 01:31:34,560
streets. You haven't solved
all the murders. You haven't
stopped all the crimes.

1511
01:31:34,561 --> 01:31:38,910
He, why are you raising wasting
any resources on this silly issue?

1512
01:31:39,000 --> 01:31:42,810
This is dumb. We're going to
get an interest that have money.

1513
01:31:46,440 --> 01:31:50,040
Tennessee honey. Oh my goodness. What
is that? What did you just put down?

1514
01:31:50,400 --> 01:31:54,810
Is that Jack Daniels? Jack Daniels.
Honey, I think we have chips here,

1515
01:31:54,840 --> 01:31:57,880
but that'll sound awesome
on the microphone. Great.

1516
01:31:58,220 --> 01:32:00,280
I guess is how we make
friends on the Internet.

1517
01:32:01,150 --> 01:32:05,630
Whoa. What's she? Oh Damn. What
is, what is that name again? Test.

1518
01:32:06,010 --> 01:32:09,440
Is it a Burrito?
The rice and you go,

1519
01:32:09,870 --> 01:32:13,160
I want to eat that and then saying or
you want us to say? Probably same first.

1520
01:32:13,250 --> 01:32:16,180
I should probably say how the recipe
you'll be spraying all over this mother

1521
01:32:16,181 --> 01:32:20,320
fucker. What a lady. Um, I'm supposed
to have dinner with my parents.

1522
01:32:20,321 --> 01:32:24,130
Actually my parents are in town.
They came out to see us for Sheryl Crow,

1523
01:32:24,131 --> 01:32:27,640
which is really, really cool. Awesome.
Yeah, they're, they're fine. So, uh,

1524
01:32:27,641 --> 01:32:31,030
you've been living in this crazy little
dream life now. Does it feel like it? Um,

1525
01:32:31,480 --> 01:32:34,510
it's, uh, it's interesting, you know,

1526
01:32:34,540 --> 01:32:39,400
like right now I'm like, I'm
really tired, really working hard.

1527
01:32:39,401 --> 01:32:41,830
Like you're constantly drawing,
constantly performing.

1528
01:32:41,940 --> 01:32:44,020
I'm at that point where I'm just like,
fuck,

1529
01:32:44,080 --> 01:32:47,660
like I just want a little bit
of slack something. Right. Um,

1530
01:32:47,730 --> 01:32:49,190
and I think we're close,
you know,

1531
01:32:49,210 --> 01:32:52,190
I think this Kickstarter things
going to help us a lot. Um,

1532
01:32:52,240 --> 01:32:55,180
and Sheryl crow has been amazing.
And um,

1533
01:32:55,360 --> 01:32:58,210
actually Ben and I need to finish writing
our third record and we're going to

1534
01:32:58,211 --> 01:33:01,870
actually spend some time in Nashville,
which is a very reasonable,

1535
01:33:02,140 --> 01:33:06,100
reasonably priced place to live.
I've been drinking,

1536
01:33:08,950 --> 01:33:11,650
but it's a, it's a nice area.
Nashville, it's beautiful. It's great.

1537
01:33:11,690 --> 01:33:15,790
You know what it has, it has all this
space. And now I've got Louise, the dog,

1538
01:33:15,880 --> 01:33:19,020
Ralphie may lives in Nashville. Do
you know Ralphie's comedian? I don't.

1539
01:33:19,270 --> 01:33:22,240
He shares that. He's got a house there
in a house here. I thought, oh cool,

1540
01:33:22,600 --> 01:33:26,620
we should talk to him. We're doing some
shows there and stuff like that. But um,

1541
01:33:26,670 --> 01:33:29,260
you know, everything's been
great. I, at the end of the day,

1542
01:33:29,290 --> 01:33:31,450
I'll be honest with you that,
you know,

1543
01:33:31,451 --> 01:33:33,460
because all these like
uncomfortable places we're in,

1544
01:33:33,461 --> 01:33:34,960
because I'll to speak candidly,

1545
01:33:34,961 --> 01:33:38,200
Ben and I are without places
of our own right to live.

1546
01:33:38,200 --> 01:33:41,500
So we like crashed with friends and
that gets hard after a while because you

1547
01:33:41,501 --> 01:33:45,440
just feel like an asshole all the time.
But it's so old school rock and roll. No.

1548
01:33:45,460 --> 01:33:49,960
Well, yes and no, but, but you know, I am.
Yes. You need that chapter in the movie.

1549
01:33:50,020 --> 01:33:52,150
You're right. You're
absolutely right. Um, and I,

1550
01:33:52,151 --> 01:33:54,910
I do have appreciation for it and
I, I feel really good, you know,

1551
01:33:54,970 --> 01:33:57,930
even when I'm tired and all that stuff.
But the coolest part is that I,

1552
01:33:57,931 --> 01:34:01,600
I feel really good about the tunes
are writing and, and just the,

1553
01:34:01,601 --> 01:34:03,340
the shows we've been
playing because there,

1554
01:34:03,341 --> 01:34:07,570
there is this like element of like
that's like the place where I am the

1555
01:34:07,571 --> 01:34:08,860
happiest.
Do you know what I mean?

1556
01:34:08,861 --> 01:34:12,640
Like to be right now as far as this is
when you're creative, why don't we, yeah.

1557
01:34:12,680 --> 01:34:16,060
When I'm, when we're playing, you know,
when we're on the stage, cause it's like,

1558
01:34:16,520 --> 01:34:21,330
it's this great experience and
there's a lot of things happening, um,

1559
01:34:21,880 --> 01:34:24,070
up there that like make
it, it's like, oh yeah,

1560
01:34:24,071 --> 01:34:28,030
that's why we're sleeping on couches. It
amazing. That was really good. You know,

1561
01:34:28,250 --> 01:34:31,830
your life narrowed down to such a
focus, you know what I mean? Right.

1562
01:34:31,970 --> 01:34:34,280
Because everything is going into this,

1563
01:34:34,490 --> 01:34:38,570
these like this 45 minutes every day
on stage were out for two months,

1564
01:34:38,720 --> 01:34:42,400
for 45 minutes, you know, like
five times a week. So it'd be,

1565
01:34:42,410 --> 01:34:45,680
it becomes this like focal point of
everything, which is like, I don't know,

1566
01:34:45,681 --> 01:34:47,510
that's an exciting feeling I guess.

1567
01:34:47,660 --> 01:34:50,750
Oh yeah. Yeah. I share
it with a standup comedy.

1568
01:34:50,751 --> 01:34:55,751
It's a very similar sort of a intense
moment that you prepare for all the time.

1569
01:34:57,410 --> 01:34:58,243
Yeah.
You know?

1570
01:34:58,870 --> 01:35:01,820
Yeah. It's, it's so, so weird.
Things performing. You know,

1571
01:35:01,940 --> 01:35:04,550
I've always just tried to describe it,
like,

1572
01:35:04,910 --> 01:35:08,660
just be step outside of civilization
and look at what's really going on.

1573
01:35:09,260 --> 01:35:12,170
What is really going on when you're
performing well at some weird energy

1574
01:35:12,171 --> 01:35:17,090
exchange. It's like you're, you're giving
them these things that you thought up,

1575
01:35:17,091 --> 01:35:20,990
this creativity that you've worked on and
honed and you're showing them this and

1576
01:35:20,991 --> 01:35:23,870
it's entertaining and they feel good.

1577
01:35:24,080 --> 01:35:27,080
They feel good when they listen
to your song, they feel good.

1578
01:35:27,230 --> 01:35:29,450
When you play a great
song and you hit a note,

1579
01:35:29,810 --> 01:35:33,800
literally the person's
body feels different. Yeah.

1580
01:35:34,250 --> 01:35:36,500
And that's what happens when
you do comedy as well. When you,

1581
01:35:36,501 --> 01:35:38,110
when someone's on stage and
they're killing, and I'm,

1582
01:35:38,111 --> 01:35:41,990
I'm watching it on my holding my sides
laughing. My body's feels different.

1583
01:35:42,290 --> 01:35:44,990
My body's like tingling with laughter.
Like if Joey Diaz,

1584
01:35:45,180 --> 01:35:48,020
she starts still even don't even know
Joey Diaz. You gotta meet Joey Dance.

1585
01:35:48,080 --> 01:35:50,870
I know the name. I know you guys
talk about him. Funniest human being.

1586
01:35:50,871 --> 01:35:52,850
I've ever met in my life. You'll
just, you'll be in the role.

1587
01:35:52,851 --> 01:35:55,630
He just to break things down for you
cock sucker. It'll just tell you he's,

1588
01:35:55,640 --> 01:35:58,760
he's just crazy old Cuban dude.
He's the baddest motherfucker ever.

1589
01:35:58,940 --> 01:36:02,780
But he makes me laugh so hard
that my body feels different.

1590
01:36:05,080 --> 01:36:09,580
Bodies like tingling, hilarity,
you know, that's, that's uh,

1591
01:36:09,880 --> 01:36:11,230
that's why we're so addicted to it.

1592
01:36:11,260 --> 01:36:14,080
We're so addicted to this weird
energy exchange, you know? No,

1593
01:36:14,110 --> 01:36:18,820
I really want to talk about this thing
that happened for our first Sheryl crow

1594
01:36:18,821 --> 01:36:22,120
show. You know, in relation to
what you're saying. And like, um,

1595
01:36:22,630 --> 01:36:26,920
we played in this theater in Santa Rosa,
California and it, it was sold out.

1596
01:36:26,921 --> 01:36:29,930
There's like about 1500
people and it was indoors. Um,

1597
01:36:30,010 --> 01:36:31,960
and a lot of times when you play theaters,
you know,

1598
01:36:31,961 --> 01:36:36,310
everybody sits for the opening band. So
there's, it's, it's kind of an awkward,

1599
01:36:36,640 --> 01:36:37,690
like, you feel like, oh fuck.

1600
01:36:37,990 --> 01:36:41,680
Like nobody's getting up when there's
like a more sort of upbeat song and you're

1601
01:36:41,681 --> 01:36:45,490
just like, it's quiet. You could
hear a pin drop, which is good,

1602
01:36:45,700 --> 01:36:49,060
but it's like totally nerve wracking.
But we had this thing,

1603
01:36:49,150 --> 01:36:53,590
this really great show. Um, and at
the, at the end of the show, um,

1604
01:36:54,160 --> 01:36:55,060
you know,
everybody,

1605
01:36:55,061 --> 01:36:58,450
and this was the second time this has
happened and we've been a band for a long

1606
01:36:58,451 --> 01:36:59,490
time and the second time we,

1607
01:36:59,510 --> 01:37:03,820
we felt this way in a theater and it was
sort of somebody else's show, you know,

1608
01:37:03,821 --> 01:37:06,580
were the opening band. It's not our show
there. They're there to see Sheryl crow.

1609
01:37:06,730 --> 01:37:09,290
Right? And we're fortunately, you know,

1610
01:37:09,370 --> 01:37:12,310
fortunate enough to be
there to get some attention.

1611
01:37:12,940 --> 01:37:17,590
And we had this incredible standing
ovation and they put the lights on the

1612
01:37:17,591 --> 01:37:21,070
people and you could see just this,
all these people like,

1613
01:37:21,220 --> 01:37:24,250
and they were glowing and it just like,
it was like this,

1614
01:37:24,251 --> 01:37:26,080
like it was like a wave crashing over you.

1615
01:37:26,081 --> 01:37:30,160
But like it like a good way of just
like people being like, yeah, all right,

1616
01:37:30,190 --> 01:37:34,870
we like you, we accept you. And it was so
intense that like my, I was, I, you know,

1617
01:37:34,871 --> 01:37:38,240
my, my eyes were kind of crying and I was
so embarrassed because I didn't want to

1618
01:37:38,250 --> 01:37:39,130
like look like an idiot,

1619
01:37:39,160 --> 01:37:43,660
but it was so like physically my body
was like accepting all this warmth from

1620
01:37:43,661 --> 01:37:48,370
all these strangers and it was, it
was amazing. It was so great. Yeah,

1621
01:37:48,400 --> 01:37:53,110
it's a trippy feeling. It really is.
A similar thing happened at Coachella.

1622
01:37:53,111 --> 01:37:56,010
I felt like there was people so excited to

1623
01:37:56,010 --> 01:37:57,000
be there at Coachella.

1624
01:37:57,001 --> 01:37:59,400
It's this crazy experience and then
you're in this place in the middle of the

1625
01:37:59,401 --> 01:38:03,630
desert and everyone's just so pumped
up to see whatever happens in the first

1626
01:38:03,631 --> 01:38:08,520
moment in our set where like a big beat
dropped. Like in the, the second song,

1627
01:38:08,521 --> 01:38:09,590
which is Gosh,

1628
01:38:10,350 --> 01:38:14,820
there was this like eruption from the
crowd and everyone just gave you this huge

1629
01:38:14,821 --> 01:38:17,430
burst of energy and I felt less
self, you know, you have to like

1630
01:38:19,460 --> 01:38:23,520
mom's breath for real. It's the
weirdest thing. When I was a kid,

1631
01:38:23,521 --> 01:38:28,521
I remember I would listen to like kiss
live and when you listen to a live album,

1632
01:38:28,860 --> 01:38:32,250
it was always like a little off.
They were like a little faster.

1633
01:38:32,500 --> 01:38:35,550
Like the song was like a little faster.
It's like something I'm not always,

1634
01:38:35,551 --> 01:38:37,770
but sometimes and I was like,
I wonder what that is.

1635
01:38:37,771 --> 01:38:40,890
Why it sounds well it's because they're
fucking jazzed up with adrenaline.

1636
01:38:41,870 --> 01:38:44,250
I mean, what, what's, what's
it been like to be kissed?

1637
01:38:45,390 --> 01:38:50,390
You imagine just standing on stage being
an ace freely in 1975 fireworks are

1638
01:38:50,911 --> 01:38:55,020
going off in your guitars.
It's the fucking places going Shit House.

1639
01:38:55,330 --> 01:38:59,580
28,000 people screaming at the top of
their lungs and they're painted. Yeah,

1640
01:38:59,670 --> 01:39:02,840
I mean we should start painting your
face. I was a kid during the, the,

1641
01:39:02,841 --> 01:39:06,040
the first big wave of,
of kiss and then I,

1642
01:39:06,050 --> 01:39:09,060
I couldn't imagine what it would be
like to play music like that in front of

1643
01:39:09,061 --> 01:39:11,550
that many people. Of course
he'd be playing a fast. Yeah,

1644
01:39:12,400 --> 01:39:16,470
that was a fanatical following the kiss
army. I still have a kiss army tee shirt.

1645
01:39:16,540 --> 01:39:20,910
Oh, it's a, it's a weird thing
playing for a large volume of people.

1646
01:39:21,140 --> 01:39:25,150
Most of you guys have played
for 10,000 people. We were in,

1647
01:39:25,940 --> 01:39:30,660
we were in Chicago. This is a duo to,
as a duo, is it just the two of us?

1648
01:39:30,661 --> 01:39:32,700
And actually at one point within our set,

1649
01:39:33,030 --> 01:39:37,410
the power went out in the
middle of a song and it's like,

1650
01:39:37,440 --> 01:39:41,850
that would be like, Oh God, I just peed
myself on stage and everyone can see it.

1651
01:39:42,390 --> 01:39:44,490
Well then you just go step that.
No,

1652
01:39:44,491 --> 01:39:47,270
it's way better though to do that
then the P or cell phones too. Right?

1653
01:39:47,280 --> 01:39:49,860
You're absolutely right. You're totally
right yourself on stage. Just like, dude,

1654
01:39:49,861 --> 01:39:51,910
you're fucking,
you are on your own now.

1655
01:39:52,290 --> 01:39:54,060
Nobody wants to hear
anything you have to say now.

1656
01:39:54,470 --> 01:39:56,410
No one's going to take any of these days.
Seriously.

1657
01:39:56,530 --> 01:39:59,810
He just pissed your parents dude. And
it's so rude. Really, because we bought,

1658
01:40:00,070 --> 01:40:03,690
knocks the wind out of you, you know, to
be in front all those people. But anyway,

1659
01:40:03,960 --> 01:40:08,730
not to get off of the stage pants paying
thing cause that's fun. But, um, yeah,

1660
01:40:08,731 --> 01:40:13,260
that was the most we'd ever played for
and that was a real people. Holy Shit.

1661
01:40:13,261 --> 01:40:15,290
That's a lot of people.
Whew.

1662
01:40:16,080 --> 01:40:17,460
For sure.
We're opening for Sheryl Crow.

1663
01:40:17,670 --> 01:40:20,130
This is the thing called the
Chicago folk roots festival.

1664
01:40:20,131 --> 01:40:23,700
This is just this festival we played a
couple of summers ago and there's just

1665
01:40:23,701 --> 01:40:26,870
this huge field and we'd get up there.
It's just the two of us kind of thing.

1666
01:40:27,350 --> 01:40:30,330
That's beautiful man.
Yeah. Oh cool. Is that,

1667
01:40:30,810 --> 01:40:34,320
that must be such a trip.
What does that feel like?

1668
01:40:35,550 --> 01:40:39,420
Well, when you get the energy back, when
there's this surge of anyone telling you,

1669
01:40:39,421 --> 01:40:40,020
it's just like,

1670
01:40:40,020 --> 01:40:44,160
I felt it all through my body and I had
to like slow down literally within the

1671
01:40:44,161 --> 01:40:45,180
song from just like,

1672
01:40:45,300 --> 01:40:49,580
oop. You know? You know what though?
I see myself with that energy.

1673
01:40:49,581 --> 01:40:53,830
It's like you have this incredible
experience, um, when you're, you know,

1674
01:40:54,070 --> 01:40:58,840
you're in point a and the audiences in
point B and then you kind of have to like,

1675
01:40:59,500 --> 01:41:04,000
you have to leave it there once you leave
the stage because if you take all that

1676
01:41:04,001 --> 01:41:06,850
energy with you,
like that's how you want to go,

1677
01:41:06,851 --> 01:41:10,090
like stick a needle in your arm
sometimes or like do something crazy.

1678
01:41:10,091 --> 01:41:14,050
Like I'd be like,
I feel like that energy is his not mine.

1679
01:41:15,370 --> 01:41:17,350
You know what I mean?
Like I have to leave it on the stage.

1680
01:41:17,380 --> 01:41:22,020
I really appreciate it when I'm there,
but I had this, I had a real moment of,

1681
01:41:22,050 --> 01:41:26,970
of revelation, um, from one of
our first or second tours I can,

1682
01:41:27,140 --> 01:41:29,800
I'm getting a little crazy, but
I, I met like, I had like my,

1683
01:41:29,950 --> 01:41:34,930
my palm read this, like this woman told
me that she's like, you, you need to,

1684
01:41:35,200 --> 01:41:38,320
you need to protect yourself and when
you leave the stage you need to leave the

1685
01:41:38,321 --> 01:41:43,321
stage and then have yourself as a separate
entity because otherwise it'll like

1686
01:41:43,931 --> 01:41:46,930
swallow you up.
And I believe that to be true.

1687
01:41:46,931 --> 01:41:51,790
I think that if I were to take all the
attention that I got on the stage as a

1688
01:41:51,850 --> 01:41:55,690
personal definition, I
think that's, that's a,

1689
01:41:55,691 --> 01:42:00,190
that's troublesome for my person
because I, you know, I'm there if I,

1690
01:42:00,191 --> 01:42:03,460
if I just live my life, like I
do my job and I have, you know,

1691
01:42:03,580 --> 01:42:06,730
my musical abilities and gifts and that's,
that's one thing.

1692
01:42:06,731 --> 01:42:10,390
And then that's my job and then my
passion and then then these other parts of

1693
01:42:10,391 --> 01:42:14,110
myself, like my family and my
friends and my dog and my new dog.

1694
01:42:14,500 --> 01:42:17,080
So I know what you're saying. Like,
look, that's just very apartment.

1695
01:42:17,081 --> 01:42:22,000
Ally's it's very wise to try to
separate yourself and hence your ego.

1696
01:42:22,450 --> 01:42:23,860
Yeah.
Cause it's dangerous.

1697
01:42:24,480 --> 01:42:27,460
It can be come self indulgent and
that's what everyone's terrified of.

1698
01:42:27,670 --> 01:42:31,510
Everyone's terrified of becoming
that a really ridiculous,

1699
01:42:31,511 --> 01:42:35,830
like a overbearing star singer person.
You know what I mean?

1700
01:42:35,831 --> 01:42:38,560
Like someone is just completely
out of control. A diva,

1701
01:42:38,561 --> 01:42:40,900
someone's screaming and yelling at people,
someone who's nuts.

1702
01:42:40,930 --> 01:42:44,580
It doesn't appreciate like every,
every minute of the ride. Right.

1703
01:42:44,590 --> 01:42:46,960
You realize how fortunate they are.
I mean that's,

1704
01:42:46,961 --> 01:42:49,930
that's what any artist is
terrified it becoming that person,

1705
01:42:49,931 --> 01:42:52,990
that disillusioned dis
dis disconnected person.

1706
01:42:53,020 --> 01:42:55,540
That's the worst thing that could
be, you know, you cannot be creative.

1707
01:42:56,710 --> 01:43:00,590
People who are in that position have,
it's, it's not, uh, out of maliciousness.

1708
01:43:00,591 --> 01:43:04,640
Is that a lack of awareness?
You just losing touch. It's,

1709
01:43:04,750 --> 01:43:08,560
it's been really great to see Sheryl Crow
because she is truly an amazing woman

1710
01:43:08,830 --> 01:43:13,630
and, and is humbled and so successful
yet so grounded. And she's got,

1711
01:43:13,690 --> 01:43:17,500
she's got her kids with her on the road
and the like this incredible crew around

1712
01:43:17,501 --> 01:43:20,830
her of people that they've been
helping us, which is, you know,

1713
01:43:20,831 --> 01:43:23,920
sometimes it's the opening band. You're
not, you're, you're the freshmen,

1714
01:43:23,921 --> 01:43:28,870
so no one's gonna like help the freshmen.
But, but that's a great example.

1715
01:43:28,871 --> 01:43:29,381
You know what I mean?

1716
01:43:29,381 --> 01:43:34,000
It's like a bitch with all due
respect to totally respectful.

1717
01:43:34,960 --> 01:43:38,440
But it is, it is, as you
said, you know, your ego can,

1718
01:43:38,441 --> 01:43:42,280
could just be like this atom bomb within
such a great thing and you don't want

1719
01:43:42,281 --> 01:43:45,370
that.
That's how the avoid that when you,

1720
01:43:45,520 --> 01:43:48,340
I really firmly believe that when
you get really crazy like that,

1721
01:43:49,060 --> 01:43:52,010
it hinders you creativity.
It's like you're not gonna have anything

1722
01:43:52,010 --> 01:43:52,521
else to say.

1723
01:43:52,521 --> 01:43:54,770
You're not going to have any other places
to go to because you're in like some

1724
01:43:54,771 --> 01:43:56,030
words sort of a psychic prison.

1725
01:43:56,330 --> 01:43:59,870
I know you'd trapped herself in this
weird world of not looking at things

1726
01:43:59,871 --> 01:44:02,450
realistically or I or idealistically,

1727
01:44:02,451 --> 01:44:05,630
you've trapped yourself in this world
of negative, you know, in your, your,

1728
01:44:05,660 --> 01:44:06,480
your country

1729
01:44:06,480 --> 01:44:09,700
and the universe doesn't like tough
love that word. Beautiful Man.

1730
01:44:09,701 --> 01:44:12,880
I'm so glad we didn't make a drinking
game out of it cause I'd be more drunk

1731
01:44:12,881 --> 01:44:16,450
than I already am and I'm really thinking
about it. I'm pretty hamster right now.

1732
01:44:18,590 --> 01:44:19,490
You know,
I got this one

1733
01:44:19,590 --> 01:44:22,510
writing program that I use on my
computer and it won't learn con

1734
01:44:23,140 --> 01:44:25,440
awesome.
You can make up a word you get.

1735
01:44:25,470 --> 01:44:29,070
It'll learn everything else and learn
shadow. Correct. Every learn. Fuck it.

1736
01:44:29,071 --> 01:44:32,400
It gets to con want go for the
right click and it's like, nope,

1737
01:44:34,470 --> 01:44:37,710
I won't even let you fucking,
I'm like you little bitch.

1738
01:44:37,740 --> 01:44:42,120
But it'll let you add conti. Ah, Jesus,

1739
01:44:42,121 --> 01:44:44,550
this is good.
This pot thing is freaking me out.

1740
01:44:45,010 --> 01:44:49,710
764 tax stream revenue
streams are just being cut.

1741
01:44:49,830 --> 01:44:53,340
Here's the news. If you want to look at
what happens, here's The p after you.

1742
01:44:53,860 --> 01:44:58,040
That's how it grows. Like medical
marijuana license dog shit, go on.

1743
01:44:58,600 --> 01:45:01,620
Welcome back. The medical
marijuana is legal in California,

1744
01:45:01,640 --> 01:45:05,250
but some say the dispensary's bring crime
and a nuisance to their neighborhoods.

1745
01:45:05,460 --> 01:45:08,540
Let's go live to Doug coke in
downtown La were boisterous,

1746
01:45:08,550 --> 01:45:11,550
appalled with these robots.
Supporters of the bad robot.

1747
01:45:11,551 --> 01:45:15,240
People that robot ladies go to
the robot guy who and Jessica has,

1748
01:45:15,241 --> 01:45:18,660
you know it's a very heated topic
and it doesn't look like a decision.

1749
01:45:18,661 --> 01:45:21,060
May come time and come down anytime soon.

1750
01:45:21,061 --> 01:45:24,840
City Council right now behind closed
doors in a closed session discussing the

1751
01:45:24,841 --> 01:45:28,920
legalities surrounding the possibility
of closing hundreds of medical marijuana

1752
01:45:28,921 --> 01:45:30,780
facilities around the Los Angeles.

1753
01:45:32,280 --> 01:45:34,130
We are out of control with it.
At this point.

1754
01:45:34,430 --> 01:45:36,860
We need to come up with something
that's going to work some of the police

1755
01:45:36,861 --> 01:45:39,380
department could live with the committee
can live with because we get continuing

1756
01:45:39,381 --> 01:45:41,810
complaints.
If only it were that easy.

1757
01:45:42,170 --> 01:45:46,700
City Council set to vote
Tuesday on whether to make
la pop dispensary's illegal

1758
01:45:46,970 --> 01:45:50,870
before members make that decision.
They hear public comment from both sides.

1759
01:45:51,170 --> 01:45:55,490
Those who depend on medicinal marijuana
for health is that tool shit pot

1760
01:45:55,500 --> 01:45:59,810
dispensaries or getting out of control.
It's even LAPD stance.

1761
01:45:59,930 --> 01:46:04,730
Pop clinics attract crime counsel trying
to find a solution for both the crime

1762
01:46:04,731 --> 01:46:06,980
as part whether that
means tighter enforcement,

1763
01:46:07,160 --> 01:46:10,990
limiting the number of dispensaries or
allowing a certain amount of caregivers

1764
01:46:11,000 --> 01:46:15,140
to grow marijuana under their
own conditions. Whatever
decision is made today,

1765
01:46:15,350 --> 01:46:17,570
it won't be made without heavy debate.

1766
01:46:17,900 --> 01:46:21,110
I believe in the medicinal
value of marijuana.

1767
01:46:21,710 --> 01:46:26,710
What we want to do is ban dispensaries
that are not allowed under state law.

1768
01:46:28,820 --> 01:46:32,330
I have friends that are still alive
today because of medical marijuana and

1769
01:46:32,331 --> 01:46:34,050
that's why this is so important to me.

1770
01:46:37,030 --> 01:46:38,360
Okay,
let's keep it down.

1771
01:46:42,460 --> 01:46:43,460
Pause down

1772
01:46:47,420 --> 01:46:50,100
now. Before they went into that
close, I had the chance to speak

1773
01:46:50,100 --> 01:46:54,160
with district five member Paul Koretz
and he tells me he has no clue, uh,

1774
01:46:54,300 --> 01:46:58,560
when a decision will come down today, if
in fact a decision does come down today,

1775
01:46:58,710 --> 01:47:02,070
he also tells me he has no clue which
way it's going to go. As matter of fact,

1776
01:47:02,071 --> 01:47:03,480
you've been telling me
it could end in a seven,

1777
01:47:03,481 --> 01:47:07,110
it's seven vote in which then they'll
have to figure out what's going to happen.

1778
01:47:07,470 --> 01:47:10,680
Reporting live from City Hall.
Doug Coke Ktlk five news.

1779
01:47:10,970 --> 01:47:14,990
Well unfortunately it did happen.
Fortina Oban Wow.

1780
01:47:15,050 --> 01:47:19,820
So I it really sucks
because I don't know if,

1781
01:47:19,821 --> 01:47:22,640
I wonder if you'll be able
to still deliver it cause if,

1782
01:47:22,900 --> 01:47:25,280
if you can get it delivered that,
that'd be different. If they,

1783
01:47:25,281 --> 01:47:29,120
if they just want to close it down to
have stores cause the neighborhoods and

1784
01:47:29,121 --> 01:47:31,910
crime, that's one thing. But if you
could have it delivered like pizza,

1785
01:47:31,930 --> 01:47:36,530
cause that's still, I believe legal. So
it would just ban a storefront. Yeah,

1786
01:47:36,570 --> 01:47:41,070
the store front. So I, I
believe like, you know, we, uh,

1787
01:47:41,120 --> 01:47:44,470
were friends with this company
called La speed weed, which you,

1788
01:47:44,540 --> 01:47:47,990
it's a delivery service and it's,
I think the Las largest one.

1789
01:47:48,290 --> 01:47:50,630
And I wonder if now if
that's the next thing,

1790
01:47:50,660 --> 01:47:54,140
like you're going to see these delivery
like pizza delivery trucks going down

1791
01:47:54,141 --> 01:47:57,290
the street everywhere,
making more traffic,

1792
01:47:58,130 --> 01:48:00,710
stoner traffic.
Uh,

1793
01:48:01,520 --> 01:48:04,310
it's kind of like what New
York is like, isn't it? Yeah.

1794
01:48:04,311 --> 01:48:07,790
I don't think there's much
more uh, delivery. Yeah.

1795
01:48:08,060 --> 01:48:12,790
Delivery based because they don't
have this master. Is that yeah.

1796
01:48:13,430 --> 01:48:17,060
Do that. They don't, they don't. They
don't. I think so. I'm wondering, well,

1797
01:48:17,220 --> 01:48:20,240
if it's just la county like it,

1798
01:48:20,241 --> 01:48:23,900
that means I wonder if that means
if the valley, like, you know, like

1799
01:48:24,350 --> 01:48:26,300
these people aren't even potheads Brian,
they don't care.

1800
01:48:26,900 --> 01:48:29,900
Look at the both of them. They
don't care. They get go dispensary.

1801
01:48:30,150 --> 01:48:33,770
You wouldn't even panic. No Way. If
someone said no more whiskey for you,

1802
01:48:33,771 --> 01:48:37,550
I'd be like, Ha, I dead body. But
that's not what they're saying.

1803
01:48:37,551 --> 01:48:39,770
They're saying no more pie.
Like, I'm cool with that.

1804
01:48:41,860 --> 01:48:44,420
Like I already went down a
dark road once accidentally,

1805
01:48:45,800 --> 01:48:48,830
Daniels distillery and stuck
up for the rest of eternity.

1806
01:48:48,950 --> 01:48:51,170
I don't know what to do with that pot.
Especially for writing.

1807
01:48:51,680 --> 01:48:55,020
I really don't know what I do. You be
real productive. Favorite Shit. Yeah.

1808
01:48:55,080 --> 01:48:58,100
Well can we? Yeah, I'm super
productive. See it's funny.

1809
01:48:58,310 --> 01:49:02,590
Everything affects everybody differently.
I bitch when I am high.

1810
01:49:02,870 --> 01:49:06,920
I bet it's the rock a bit. You get in the
wrong shit. I, you know, I don't know.

1811
01:49:06,921 --> 01:49:11,030
I've tried all the different
things the best. I think, you know,

1812
01:49:11,031 --> 01:49:14,270
vessel has been a spliff for me because
it's just a little bit and I like,

1813
01:49:14,480 --> 01:49:17,730
I like tobacco, like
cigarettes. So you know,

1814
01:49:17,780 --> 01:49:19,580
you could smoke a cigarette
if you want one. I'm good.

1815
01:49:19,590 --> 01:49:22,460
Actually I haven't smoked it a couple
of weeks cause when I'm touring I try to

1816
01:49:22,461 --> 01:49:25,550
fucking keep worrying. Worry about that
with your voice thing. Yeah, absolutely.

1817
01:49:25,700 --> 01:49:29,300
So I don't smoke like I used to,
but I,

1818
01:49:29,360 --> 01:49:33,320
when I do like I really fucking enjoy a
cigarette but I don't smoke all the time.

1819
01:49:33,350 --> 01:49:35,180
That's an Internet meme right there.

1820
01:49:35,181 --> 01:49:37,610
What you just said is going
to be an Internet meme. So me,

1821
01:49:37,620 --> 01:49:42,470
a photo of you saying I don't smoke,
but if I do it's going to be a cigarette.

1822
01:49:44,760 --> 01:49:49,270
Is that what I said? Oh, what a
winner. Oh Great. Don't encourage

1823
01:49:50,800 --> 01:49:55,510
you rarely smoke. Like I really
enjoy it when I do. It's like,

1824
01:49:55,650 --> 01:49:58,750
you know, cause like I'm a singer.
That's stupid. What I'm saying.

1825
01:49:58,751 --> 01:50:02,680
I mean you have that crazy gift. Well
thank you. But I mean, I, you know,

1826
01:50:02,681 --> 01:50:06,970
I used to smoke a lot and then I became
aware of how much of a hazard that was

1827
01:50:06,971 --> 01:50:08,500
to my,
my career,

1828
01:50:09,230 --> 01:50:13,810
my moneymaker pleasure you can produce
by making noise with your mouth.

1829
01:50:16,450 --> 01:50:20,750
Think about that. That's really, that's
what your career, not really, man.

1830
01:50:22,240 --> 01:50:27,160
My mouth is very important. Yeah, but
that's just the response. It's no, no,

1831
01:50:27,170 --> 01:50:29,680
no, no. You, when you do it,

1832
01:50:29,681 --> 01:50:32,440
it's totally different
because when you're singing,

1833
01:50:32,441 --> 01:50:34,000
it's a completely different experience.

1834
01:50:34,090 --> 01:50:38,980
The actual harmony of the words of the
sound you're making with your mouth.

1835
01:50:39,040 --> 01:50:43,100
Why don't harmonize with
themselves, whatever the fuck
it is. W the harmony of it.

1836
01:50:43,101 --> 01:50:46,140
Is it just about, am I saying
the right thing? Whatever it is,

1837
01:50:46,930 --> 01:50:50,380
the whole awesome miss of it.
Okay. I cranium with your mouth.

1838
01:50:50,530 --> 01:50:54,690
You're creating with your
mouth. That's amazing. You
know like when, when the, the,

1839
01:50:55,010 --> 01:50:57,460
the part of that video that I loved
when you guys were on the roof,

1840
01:50:57,730 --> 01:50:59,830
it was like just the first,
the first verse,

1841
01:50:59,831 --> 01:51:02,860
like when the first few words of
your mouth, he's like, he'd go, Whoa,

1842
01:51:02,861 --> 01:51:07,030
that's a crazy noise she can make
with our mouth. It sounds bad ass,

1843
01:51:07,570 --> 01:51:12,460
you know, because it's like I have
a weird laugh. Whatever it is,

1844
01:51:12,490 --> 01:51:15,940
it's, it's, it's the sound of
it and then it's more than that.

1845
01:51:15,970 --> 01:51:20,970
It's the idea expressed in the words
and then even crazier your energy and

1846
01:51:22,061 --> 01:51:25,180
interpretation. It could be whatever
fucking pent up shit you have.

1847
01:51:25,270 --> 01:51:27,100
It doesn't even have to have
anything to do with the lyrics,

1848
01:51:27,250 --> 01:51:30,820
but it goes through those lyrics
and comes out in the song.

1849
01:51:31,090 --> 01:51:35,170
And when someone sings with like
real emotion and real passion,

1850
01:51:35,380 --> 01:51:36,820
it's like a creepy feeling.

1851
01:51:36,821 --> 01:51:39,460
It's like you almost feel like you
shouldn't be allowed to be watching this.

1852
01:51:39,880 --> 01:51:41,770
It's like they really,
you really like,

1853
01:51:41,830 --> 01:51:45,490
especially you two guys on that rooftop
because or wherever the fuck you were

1854
01:51:45,670 --> 01:51:49,510
because there was a tap was a rooftop,
but because there was no one else,

1855
01:51:49,511 --> 01:51:52,870
it wasn't, it wasn't like it was a crowd.
It wasn't like there was, you know,

1856
01:51:53,110 --> 01:51:54,790
synthesizers are in it.
You know what I'm saying?

1857
01:51:54,970 --> 01:51:57,610
It's just you guys on the rooftop there.
So God damn sweet Joe.

1858
01:51:58,240 --> 01:52:01,840
I'm just being really nice and
we appreciate it. Well listen,

1859
01:52:01,841 --> 01:52:06,590
you guys are the shit. Play
some music. Can I a question?

1860
01:52:06,740 --> 01:52:11,530
I hope so. Can I request La
River? Fuck. Can't do it.

1861
01:52:11,560 --> 01:52:14,620
Give us a sec. You've got to have to,
can we start off with something else?

1862
01:52:14,621 --> 01:52:19,090
A warmer? Yeah, yeah, sure,
sure, sure, sure. I just love
that song. Oh, that's so funny.

1863
01:52:21,310 --> 01:52:25,630
I'm sorry. I should have a rude, I
forget. I'm an idiot. Like I told you,

1864
01:52:25,631 --> 01:52:27,490
I don't know anything about music.
I mean,

1865
01:52:27,491 --> 01:52:30,580
you would have to actually have
the right stuff and I'm like,

1866
01:52:31,090 --> 01:52:33,520
make the noise that make
that song sound so good.

1867
01:52:33,950 --> 01:52:35,830
Come on and make that
noise with your mouth.

1868
01:52:40,420 --> 01:52:41,400
Mechanical devices.

1869
01:52:44,350 --> 01:52:45,640
How do you know when on

1870
01:52:46,100 --> 01:52:49,850
when you're tuning it, you just know
about your hearing it we use machines,

1871
01:52:49,980 --> 01:52:51,370
these machines to tune things.

1872
01:52:52,190 --> 01:52:57,020
Was it old school and the old
school way? Was it? Um, was it,

1873
01:52:58,200 --> 01:53:03,170
I think they still buy electronic
tuners eighties. Oh really? Yeah.

1874
01:53:03,171 --> 01:53:05,000
And it,
and it changed things a lot man,

1875
01:53:05,390 --> 01:53:10,250
because all of a sudden you have this
precision. That's right. Which is good.

1876
01:53:10,251 --> 01:53:12,980
And also, I mean it's like
kind of analog to digital.

1877
01:53:13,130 --> 01:53:16,670
Who's your favorite guitarist ever? And
this guy named Django Reinhardt. Oh,

1878
01:53:16,671 --> 01:53:20,660
you're one of those obscure indie dude's.
I see what you're doing there. Also,

1879
01:53:20,690 --> 01:53:22,510
Jimi Hendrix. Awesome. I loved it.

1880
01:53:22,511 --> 01:53:26,500
That's why I named this teacher Rogan
experience. I totally jacked Jimmy. Jimmy,

1881
01:53:26,810 --> 01:53:29,560
I have no less than 15
Jimi Hendrix tee shirts.

1882
01:53:32,260 --> 01:53:37,040
Brian Bohm. Gary Gary Clark Jr. Yeah.

1883
01:53:37,041 --> 01:53:40,850
Why don't I know that name? Yeah, he's a
musician in New York. Uh, Austin. Austin.

1884
01:53:40,970 --> 01:53:43,380
You got to check him. Yeah, he's, he uh,

1885
01:53:43,500 --> 01:53:48,330
is a black gentleman and he says like
this bluesy rock. Yeah, yeah, yeah,

1886
01:53:48,390 --> 01:53:51,200
yeah. Somebody recommended
him. I radically enough.

1887
01:53:51,290 --> 01:53:55,430
I don't think it's ironically but
recommended. Sorry. Sorry, please.

1888
01:53:55,660 --> 01:53:58,340
They recommended a him on
a thread about you guys,

1889
01:53:58,400 --> 01:54:00,460
which is even more fascinating.
And my message boards,

1890
01:54:01,470 --> 01:54:04,610
I think they brought it up last
time they were on the farm. Did you?

1891
01:54:05,480 --> 01:54:09,050
I don't remember.
That's what Brian's here.

1892
01:54:09,120 --> 01:54:13,850
God point mother fucker.
So he's um,

1893
01:54:14,490 --> 01:54:16,350
what does his, what does his, um, his,

1894
01:54:16,430 --> 01:54:19,100
his CD or as record or release
or whatever you would call it.

1895
01:54:19,101 --> 01:54:23,690
Not as digital release.
Is that what you call them?

1896
01:54:23,720 --> 01:54:26,500
What do you call them? Like when you guys
put d, Say, hey, we put out a new Erp,

1897
01:54:28,630 --> 01:54:32,770
recode. Recode. You still say yes,

1898
01:54:32,880 --> 01:54:37,220
they'll say record,
right? No fucking excuses.

1899
01:54:37,530 --> 01:54:41,320
Push House honey, honey.

1900
01:54:41,440 --> 01:54:42,560
And I'm from Cleveland.

1901
01:54:43,760 --> 01:54:46,190
I hope they can keep that whole
English accent thing going.

1902
01:54:46,550 --> 01:54:49,850
I hope the world in this
age of information and
distribution of information

1903
01:54:49,851 --> 01:54:53,000
doesn't match nice.
I hope they don't become Americanized.

1904
01:54:53,370 --> 01:54:55,970
Like send them too many
movies and break their will.

1905
01:54:57,470 --> 01:54:59,680
They'll just going to realize,
but it's a better way to talk.

1906
01:55:00,470 --> 01:55:02,540
The Americans have a better way to talk.
Let's be honest.

1907
01:55:03,260 --> 01:55:07,690
Fucking might just join them.
We'll just lead with the ego.

1908
01:55:08,870 --> 01:55:11,690
Lead with ego.
We're America and we're not content.

1909
01:55:11,870 --> 01:55:16,870
That's my a new logo for what everyone
in 2016 it's a we're America and we're

1910
01:55:17,541 --> 01:55:19,730
not convinced.
That's our philosophy.

1911
01:55:19,970 --> 01:55:24,970
So anything that we do as Americans
that would make us look like cuts we

1912
01:55:25,101 --> 01:55:27,370
automatically can't do.
Cause we've said we're not cutting.

1913
01:55:27,830 --> 01:55:31,940
So now he can't be starting any wars. If
you're, if you're not a client, you know

1914
01:55:33,680 --> 01:55:35,160
he can't be robbing anybody.

1915
01:55:36,960 --> 01:55:41,960
Can't be spying on you citizens
unless you're a should be.

1916
01:55:42,930 --> 01:55:44,100
We're America and we're not

1917
01:55:44,100 --> 01:55:47,820
tons. I like that 2016
that's going to make it work.

1918
01:55:47,850 --> 01:55:52,000
[inaudible] vice president
assassination proof. That's right.

1919
01:55:53,100 --> 01:55:55,080
Nobody wants to kill me.
Let Brian be president.

1920
01:55:57,360 --> 01:55:58,590
Get your helmets on.
Yeah,

1921
01:56:02,250 --> 01:56:04,980
right. We'll turn the White House
and into a mother fucking strip club.

1922
01:56:05,640 --> 01:56:08,100
Imagine if you could
like make Molly legal,

1923
01:56:08,750 --> 01:56:12,210
like if you became the even making
weed legal and you're just like,

1924
01:56:12,930 --> 01:56:15,930
I'm really bummed out Angeles too.
I can't believe that happened.

1925
01:56:15,960 --> 01:56:20,670
So is this a happy song?
You should really know Brian.

1926
01:56:20,671 --> 01:56:24,540
You're right. You should be bummed out.
It's really disgusting. It's disgusting.

1927
01:56:24,600 --> 01:56:25,920
I mean it's just,
it's nonsense.

1928
01:56:28,700 --> 01:56:32,430
What did we do here? It's not,
I would sort of happen recorded,

1929
01:56:32,431 --> 01:56:37,380
but this is called [inaudible].
[inaudible]. Okay. Yeah. Yeah.

1930
01:56:38,060 --> 01:56:39,570
You want it? Okay. Hold on.

1931
01:56:55,790 --> 01:56:57,780
Ah,
no.

1932
01:57:00,330 --> 01:57:02,770
Bushmaster from it.

1933
01:57:05,370 --> 01:57:06,540
I can't take it

1934
01:57:27,310 --> 01:57:30,230
to make me change my mind.

1935
01:57:33,410 --> 01:57:36,510
Then you got to show me.
You Good Sam.

1936
01:57:44,680 --> 01:57:46,550
Ooh, you got on him? He get mad.

1937
01:57:52,040 --> 01:57:54,370
Oh,
ah.

1938
01:57:56,820 --> 01:57:59,050
Oh
wait.

1939
01:58:24,700 --> 01:58:27,130
I seen that door should deep in your,

1940
01:58:30,940 --> 01:58:32,850
when you always cut me down

1941
01:58:36,710 --> 01:58:40,110
on the kitchen.
Oh.

1942
01:58:42,220 --> 01:58:43,840
Oh.
Is that how you get

1943
01:58:49,430 --> 01:58:50,263
ma'am?

1944
01:59:21,050 --> 01:59:22,390
Maybe.
I don't know of,

1945
01:59:41,160 --> 01:59:41,993
Oh,

1946
02:00:29,240 --> 02:00:30,910
Holy Shit.
You guys are awesome

1947
02:00:34,420 --> 02:00:36,580
string.
I might be the only one we can play.

1948
02:00:38,460 --> 02:00:42,970
Daddy's got some more history to my this.
That was amazing.

1949
02:00:43,000 --> 02:00:44,060
That was incredible.

1950
02:00:47,540 --> 02:00:52,280
That's the water. It's a great,
great, guys are so fucking talented.

1951
02:00:52,281 --> 02:00:56,500
It's stupid. Oh, you back? You
guys are really fucking good.

1952
02:00:56,501 --> 02:01:00,040
It's Kinda creepy. Kind
of creep me out, man.

1953
02:01:01,810 --> 02:01:06,580
I'm not sure like it is that how,
how did that song that you guys have,

1954
02:01:06,581 --> 02:01:11,080
that sucks. What was the name of that
song again? It's called numb. Numb it.

1955
02:01:11,081 --> 02:01:15,570
And what, how did that come
about? It came about from, um,

1956
02:01:17,050 --> 02:01:20,650
let's see. Um, probably
something to do about deck.

1957
02:01:21,560 --> 02:01:26,560
[inaudible] in a tough place
and you just don't want to,

1958
02:01:27,350 --> 02:01:30,130
if I can look the other way. He
liked our whiskey. Young lady.

1959
02:01:30,131 --> 02:01:34,760
Don't you know I do dare you.
Nothing.

1960
02:01:34,800 --> 02:01:37,660
Nothing at all.
It's a gift to the universe.

1961
02:01:37,661 --> 02:01:39,980
Just like your beloved devil's

1962
02:01:39,980 --> 02:01:40,270
lettuce.

1963
02:01:40,270 --> 02:01:42,130
Awesome.
It was marijuana like the whiskey too.

1964
02:01:42,820 --> 02:01:45,550
I think I'm to become an alcoholic
now that I can't go to the store.

1965
02:01:46,170 --> 02:01:49,190
We should all just start drinking
more. Yeah. Well that's what they want.

1966
02:01:51,690 --> 02:01:51,991
Yeah.

1967
02:01:51,991 --> 02:01:54,660
It's the whole thing is just so fucking
stupid that they're trying to suppress

1968
02:01:54,661 --> 02:01:58,550
it in any way, shape or form. That's
not to serve or protect. Cut Shit.

1969
02:01:58,930 --> 02:02:02,730
It's stupid. It's dumb. Making
no sense. Leave us alone.

1970
02:02:03,080 --> 02:02:05,020
Is that official?
I wasn't paying attention

1971
02:02:05,650 --> 02:02:10,320
laws. Too many laws set.
Don't need to have that many.

1972
02:02:10,400 --> 02:02:14,500
700 plus a dispensary is all at,
where did he just shut down immediately?

1973
02:02:14,530 --> 02:02:17,920
So fucking stupid. And
these, some of these places,

1974
02:02:17,921 --> 02:02:19,310
these are like mom and pop places.

1975
02:02:19,340 --> 02:02:24,340
Like I know there's one place and they
make their living like how the hell we're

1976
02:02:24,401 --> 02:02:27,660
getting suppressed, ladies and
gentlemen, the streets are going to fire.

1977
02:02:28,720 --> 02:02:31,600
You know what?
She should be filled with smoke.

1978
02:02:31,601 --> 02:02:36,080
Maybe six and beanbag.
Ooh,

1979
02:02:38,990 --> 02:02:39,823
I'm saying,

1980
02:02:41,680 --> 02:02:43,900
um, often. Do you guys want to,
I wanted to ask you earlier,

1981
02:02:43,901 --> 02:02:47,190
how often do you guys sit down
together and try to write like,

1982
02:02:47,200 --> 02:02:49,620
it seems like you're so hectic,
you're constantly going from town.

1983
02:02:49,730 --> 02:02:51,930
No, late lately it's been, um,

1984
02:02:52,590 --> 02:02:56,690
we probably have written once in
the past week, but you know, after,

1985
02:02:56,691 --> 02:02:58,040
after the Sheryl crow dates,

1986
02:02:58,490 --> 02:03:01,760
we were going to be on a schedule where
we're writing every day just to get the

1987
02:03:01,761 --> 02:03:02,810
next record out.
So

1988
02:03:02,880 --> 02:03:06,690
yeah, it's super hard for me if I'm
on the road just for like a weekend,

1989
02:03:06,720 --> 02:03:10,560
I couldn't imagine doing it for like five
and 600 constantly going from town to

1990
02:03:10,561 --> 02:03:12,210
town and they're trying to
squeeze in some writing.

1991
02:03:12,211 --> 02:03:15,030
It's got to be really hard to
put yourself in a place. I mean,

1992
02:03:15,031 --> 02:03:18,860
I don't know how you guys, right. How
do you, do you, um, do you have like a,

1993
02:03:18,870 --> 02:03:21,750
an idea first or do you jam,
do you, how do you guys, right.

1994
02:03:21,840 --> 02:03:25,770
Everything, we don't really have
look up, I'm chewing on ice cubes.

1995
02:03:26,360 --> 02:03:28,400
Oh, that's very cool. Like Carmen idea,

1996
02:03:28,401 --> 02:03:31,700
someone comes in with part
of the song and then if that,

1997
02:03:31,760 --> 02:03:35,120
so like art isn't good enough, you know,
for the other person to be excited,

1998
02:03:35,121 --> 02:03:36,110
then we just try to finish it.

1999
02:03:36,490 --> 02:03:37,480
So, um, you know,

2000
02:03:37,481 --> 02:03:39,940
like you'll like be driving in your car
or something and you'll just have an

2001
02:03:39,941 --> 02:03:42,910
idea and you write it down and put
it in your iPhone or something.

2002
02:03:42,911 --> 02:03:43,744
And then you guys,

2003
02:03:43,900 --> 02:03:46,860
every once in a while you'll
get this like whitening of the,

2004
02:03:46,890 --> 02:03:50,140
you'll write a whole song in
a day be like this, you know,

2005
02:03:51,240 --> 02:03:53,610
waterfall of words. And
they were like, fuck yeah.

2006
02:03:54,070 --> 02:03:58,680
And then sometimes you really got to
chip away at songs and some of our better

2007
02:03:58,681 --> 02:04:00,480
songs,
I feel like we've really been,

2008
02:04:00,780 --> 02:04:03,420
we've chipped away at and they've
started as one thing and then bend this

2009
02:04:03,421 --> 02:04:07,160
completely different, you know,
product by the end. Right.

2010
02:04:07,170 --> 02:04:11,640
You know that like the best part,
I mean not the best part but I just,

2011
02:04:11,850 --> 02:04:15,750
I guess you just have to like let it
be what it is and we try to be diligent

2012
02:04:15,751 --> 02:04:19,560
about it to write consistently. Even if
it sucks. It's like let's just do it.

2013
02:04:19,590 --> 02:04:23,940
You know, you have to exercise
this muscle. Um, but you know,

2014
02:04:24,000 --> 02:04:26,530
the more you do that,
the more you kind of get to that place.

2015
02:04:26,580 --> 02:04:28,950
You want to be out and writing with Ben,

2016
02:04:28,951 --> 02:04:31,890
we've been writing partners for years
now and never have any other writers.

2017
02:04:32,280 --> 02:04:35,000
We have, we have, but it's,
it's so different. It's like we,

2018
02:04:35,010 --> 02:04:36,720
he and I have the shorthand,
you know what I mean?

2019
02:04:36,721 --> 02:04:38,040
Like we of your stuff written by

2020
02:04:38,060 --> 02:04:41,520
Youtube. Yes. It's a very interesting
collaborative process cause you know,

2021
02:04:41,530 --> 02:04:44,250
you're both very unique and
yet you're both, you know,

2022
02:04:44,460 --> 02:04:48,780
very good and you got to figure out how
to do it together and like this weird

2023
02:04:48,781 --> 02:04:51,930
sort of a spiral that works
your ideas and his ideas.

2024
02:04:51,931 --> 02:04:54,000
And that's fascinating to me
cause like a lot of people,

2025
02:04:54,001 --> 02:04:56,760
they don't do it that way. Right. Like
one guy will be the one who writes it or

2026
02:04:58,340 --> 02:05:01,830
make the music or something. Yeah, you
guys do it all together. That's bad ass.

2027
02:05:01,890 --> 02:05:04,080
Yeah. That's a cool
relationship. You guys are like,

2028
02:05:04,380 --> 02:05:08,050
like almost like brothers and sisters,
like tied together for life, you know,

2029
02:05:08,070 --> 02:05:12,660
brothers and sisters on earth. In music.
We're a Siamese twins by the fingernail.

2030
02:05:12,690 --> 02:05:15,420
Yup. Something crazy. It
says John Hodge. Fascinating.

2031
02:05:15,740 --> 02:05:19,080
It's a fascinating relationship. You
know that you and and it works so well.

2032
02:05:19,230 --> 02:05:22,530
Your music is such, it's got, you
know, all the songs are different,

2033
02:05:22,740 --> 02:05:25,860
but you know when a song's
coming from someone, you know,

2034
02:05:25,890 --> 02:05:29,770
like there's certain like certain bands
you just knew when you heard like a

2035
02:05:29,790 --> 02:05:34,020
specific, unless you, okay.
Brian, what was that on my phone.

2036
02:05:34,980 --> 02:05:36,480
It's amazing what a beating and iPhone

2037
02:05:38,660 --> 02:05:42,540
case for tankers. Yeah. My, my phones
like tank Abbott in the early days

2038
02:05:44,960 --> 02:05:49,530
competing. Right. Um, you guys want
play something else? Sure. Can you,

2039
02:05:49,590 --> 02:05:53,930
can you play La River please?
If

2040
02:05:56,600 --> 02:05:59,290
I mess it up, don't get mad
at me. How dare you. You're
not going to mess this up.

2041
02:05:59,760 --> 02:06:04,080
Probably half a bottle of Jameson's.
And how dare you. Oh, there we go.

2042
02:06:04,140 --> 02:06:05,640
That's great.
Lead with a handicap.

2043
02:06:08,440 --> 02:06:13,130
Or You guys too, too drunk for the
Internet. Is there a such thing?

2044
02:06:14,130 --> 02:06:16,180
Nobody's watching right

2045
02:06:18,790 --> 02:06:22,750
over you. Don't worry about it.
Listen, I love you so bad, man.

2046
02:06:23,810 --> 02:06:25,200
You like a sister to be a man

2047
02:07:11,660 --> 02:07:15,570
down to the banks of the

2048
02:07:22,190 --> 02:07:23,330
concrete.

2049
02:07:32,380 --> 02:07:33,213
Oh.

2050
02:07:36,030 --> 02:07:40,120
Oh listen to the big CD sound.

2051

Shane's path.
China town.

2052
02:08:02,560 --> 02:08:06,310
My fingers.
Wow.

02:08:07,370 --> 02:08:11,610
Skin

2054
02:08:11,780 --> 02:08:15,860
Mabo down.

To the big city south.

2058
02:08:29,360 --> 02:08:30,130
Gotcha.

2059
02:08:30,130 --> 02:08:30,963
Matt.

2060
02:08:32,600 --> 02:08:34,910
All down trains pass.

2061
02:09:05,870 --> 02:09:07,630
Oh,

02:09:18,020 --> 02:09:21,550
down by the chains pass Chinatown.

2064
02:09:23,860 --> 02:09:25,540
Ah,

2065
02:09:43,110 --> 02:09:43,943
man.

2066
02:09:47,950 --> 02:09:51,350
Yeah. Boy, that was a beautiful song.

2067
02:09:52,520 --> 02:09:57,250
That was a beautiful song. I love
that song. It's so creepy to, Oh,

2068
02:09:57,440 --> 02:10:01,730
you got skinned knees, you're looking
for bodies. The water's black.

2069
02:10:01,800 --> 02:10:06,350
There's a lot creepy shit.
Jumping fences. Los Angeles.

2070
02:10:06,380 --> 02:10:10,520
Fuck yeah, it is, but it's cool. You know,
I love the, I love new, my new home park.

2071
02:10:11,000 --> 02:10:13,620
It was on his TV, so really cool. Yeah,

2072
02:10:13,640 --> 02:10:16,110
it's called brothers and
sisters is on this. Okay.

2073
02:10:16,370 --> 02:10:20,090
And there's like this wedding weddings
and then these beautiful romance,

2074
02:10:20,091 --> 02:10:24,320
these people holding hands and then he
thought it's how body in the weeds coming

2075
02:10:24,321 --> 02:10:26,850
up. They just like, they
weren't listening to him. Well,

2076
02:10:26,960 --> 02:10:30,410
maybe they were trying to be ironic.
Maybe they were like fake hipsters.

2077
02:10:30,411 --> 02:10:31,490
It didn't really understand it,

2078
02:10:31,820 --> 02:10:34,430
so they're trying to use your
music in a fucking nefarious

2079
02:10:34,430 --> 02:10:38,180
way. Yeah, that's what it was.
That word in the Ferris wheel,

2080
02:10:38,660 --> 02:10:42,660
it's almost as good as a foot,
a foot like that. Serious.

2081
02:10:42,670 --> 02:10:47,000
You can use it in there. There may be
some fuckery of foot. That's a very,

2082
02:10:47,010 --> 02:10:49,860
also a good word is as good
as it gets. Yeah. I happened,

2083
02:10:50,240 --> 02:10:54,380
I stopped using that one and it was
restarted by my friend Steve Maxwell,

2084
02:10:54,610 --> 02:10:57,410
who was talking about like fake
martial arts guys. It's like, Hey,

2085
02:10:57,411 --> 02:11:02,060
there's a lot of fuckery involved. Oh, I
love this guy, but that's it. The word,

2086
02:11:02,061 --> 02:11:05,260
I fucking lost it for a long time.
Now it's back fine.

2087
02:11:05,270 --> 02:11:06,560
You can keep buying it with a foot.

2088
02:11:07,010 --> 02:11:09,980
You know something you could bring up
almost every day if something's wrong.

2089
02:11:09,981 --> 02:11:14,520
He's just saying, I believe there's
some fuckery afoot. Right? I like that.

2090
02:11:15,580 --> 02:11:17,660
The whole, the whole
thing better. How do we,

2091
02:11:18,140 --> 02:11:22,250
how do we move you guys to
the next level of, uh, of,

2092
02:11:22,260 --> 02:11:24,170
of showbusiness stardom,

2093
02:11:24,230 --> 02:11:27,140
whatever it is to get your shit out there
so you don't have all these financial

2094
02:11:27,141 --> 02:11:28,520
issues because this shit is annoying me.

2095
02:11:28,780 --> 02:11:32,630
Well, and it's annoying me that you guys
can be good and have any money problems.

2096
02:11:32,690 --> 02:11:34,340
We reach our Kickstarter goal.

2097
02:11:34,700 --> 02:11:37,700
That'll help a lot because it'll
get us through this next tour.

2098
02:11:37,701 --> 02:11:40,580
We're going out in October.
Let's be totally clear.

2099
02:11:40,790 --> 02:11:43,900
We're not just asking for money to
like sit here and play songs. We have,

2100
02:11:43,901 --> 02:11:47,240
we have a tour in October with a band
called trampled by turtles and they're

2101
02:11:47,241 --> 02:11:51,380
incredible. They're there.
This, uh, uh, their, uh, um,

2102
02:11:51,580 --> 02:11:55,700
a bluegrass band from
Duluth, Minnesota. And um,

2103
02:11:55,820 --> 02:11:58,490
in order for us to go out with them,
we need help.

2104
02:11:58,520 --> 02:12:02,060
We need financial assistance because
we were like, we're at zero. Right?

2105
02:12:02,061 --> 02:12:05,200
And it doesn't pay enough to
even pay for your expenses. No.

2106
02:12:05,220 --> 02:12:09,130
And to get the merchandise and all that
stuff and to pay for a tour manager and

2107
02:12:09,131 --> 02:12:12,770
a van and gas alone.
You know it's really fucking hard.

2108
02:12:12,900 --> 02:12:14,760
Yeah, it's, you're in a weird situation.

2109
02:12:14,790 --> 02:12:19,470
It's like you guys are like
superstar artists. You like
super talented, like your,

2110
02:12:19,471 --> 02:12:22,470
your music is amazing. But I'm like,
how the fuck are you bitches broke?

2111
02:12:22,480 --> 02:12:26,150
That doesn't make any sense.
Really irresponsible areas. Yeah.

2112
02:12:27,840 --> 02:12:30,910
Betty spends a lot of money
on mod products. Fuck fuck.

2113
02:12:30,940 --> 02:12:34,660
I love a nice pair of Chinos.
Open the sports page. Fuck.

2114
02:12:35,140 --> 02:12:37,660
He goes into j crew and he
spends thousands of dollars

2115
02:12:37,800 --> 02:12:38,750
do goes off on that.

2116
02:12:38,860 --> 02:12:43,690
But like I can and smelly bath
places at those at the ball.

2117
02:12:43,720 --> 02:12:44,830
Do I? Yeah. You know,

2118
02:12:44,831 --> 02:12:48,300
let's put together some people just
buy a bunch of shit I'll never use.

2119
02:12:49,340 --> 02:12:52,290
Oh a bad thought. I'm going to
take it. I'll be honest with you,

2120
02:12:52,500 --> 02:12:54,690
when I was younger and I had it,
like when I,

2121
02:12:55,500 --> 02:13:00,030
when I had a steady job actually when I
worked at Baby Blues Selling Barbecue,

2122
02:13:00,031 --> 02:13:02,460
I made more money selling barbecue
than I did with a record deal.

2123
02:13:02,910 --> 02:13:07,910
I had like sweet cash all the time and
I would just buy whatever I wanted.

2124
02:13:07,981 --> 02:13:08,580
Like I was like,

2125
02:13:08,580 --> 02:13:12,270
I'd go to nice restaurants all the
time with my friends and I by myself,

2126
02:13:12,271 --> 02:13:15,930
whatever clothing I wanted and, and
it's funny, this point in my life, like,

2127
02:13:16,260 --> 02:13:19,320
you know, Shit's pretty tight, so
you got, you got to really like,

2128
02:13:19,520 --> 02:13:23,510
like unless I need it, you need
a sugar daddy? No, I'm not.

2129
02:13:23,511 --> 02:13:27,000
I'm not that kind of girl. Listen, I that
kind of girl. Joe. I know you're not,

2130
02:13:27,001 --> 02:13:29,610
but let's pretend you were.
Don't you pressure me?

2131
02:13:30,710 --> 02:13:32,160
Let's come up with a fake sugar

2132
02:13:32,160 --> 02:13:36,260
daddy. Some perfect scenario
type like a podcast empire guys.

2133
02:13:38,860 --> 02:13:42,570
Did you like guys with a
Werewolf facial hair? Very here.

2134
02:13:43,040 --> 02:13:47,160
You need to be able to physically
pick me up. That's true.

2135
02:13:47,350 --> 02:13:52,350
There should be to tire throw football
and you're in the desert with a hurt

2136
02:13:52,501 --> 02:13:55,580
ankle in the desert. The man's got to be
able to carry you. You dead. Mm. Yeah,

2137
02:13:55,620 --> 02:13:57,000
because otherwise you're just
going to lay there and die.

2138
02:13:57,060 --> 02:14:00,580
I hurt my ankle all the time, so I can't
carry you. Yeah. What the fuck, you know?

2139
02:14:00,840 --> 02:14:02,520
Oh Man.
Should be able to carry as a woman.

2140
02:14:02,650 --> 02:14:05,100
[inaudible] surely carrier through the
desert and these over the shoulder.

2141
02:14:05,101 --> 02:14:06,390
Actually I'm style.

2142
02:14:06,510 --> 02:14:10,290
I really have no idea what I want and
we'll find out as time goes on. Oh,

2143
02:14:10,320 --> 02:14:15,160
we talking for real?
You play Oh, red band.

2144
02:14:15,220 --> 02:14:17,610
Multiyear Ohio. That's my favorite.
Yeah, that's a great song.

2145
02:14:17,760 --> 02:14:21,770
I messed up the lyrics the other night.
Oh No, I felt like, what did you,

2146
02:14:21,780 --> 02:14:25,470
did I fucking freestyle when
you saw, um, what's her name?

2147
02:14:25,680 --> 02:14:29,340
Fuck up the national anthem. What's
her name? Christina Aguilera.

2148
02:14:29,460 --> 02:14:32,820
When you saw that, did you wince like
when you like am I see a comedian bomb?

2149
02:14:32,821 --> 02:14:36,200
I can't even watch. You know what? No,
it's, it happens. It's like, well that,

2150
02:14:36,230 --> 02:14:39,720
that's d no disrespect. I don't want to,
I don't want to fucking dog on anybody,

2151
02:14:39,721 --> 02:14:43,350
but like, but what, like here's
the thing, like we hadn't, again,

2152
02:14:43,740 --> 02:14:45,390
we hadn't slept for a couple of days,
like Ben,

2153
02:14:45,391 --> 02:14:49,470
like exhausted and sometimes sometimes
like you get comfortable and then you

2154
02:14:49,471 --> 02:14:52,890
zone out and then you're like, fuck,
fuck, fuck. And then you just, and I did,

2155
02:14:52,891 --> 02:14:54,450
I freestyle then it made
sense and I was like,

2156
02:14:54,480 --> 02:14:56,940
maybe those lyrics would have been better
than the original ones we'd written.

2157
02:14:57,630 --> 02:14:59,190
It could be any number of things though,
right?

2158
02:14:59,300 --> 02:15:04,290
Cause it was like I'm a get you Sucka Mama
said knock you out Ohio today. Was it?

2159
02:15:04,330 --> 02:15:08,570
We good cause that what you did now what
did you do that was like judging me.

2160
02:15:08,580 --> 02:15:12,940
Go for it. Um, no. I, I literally
just started saying worth.

2161
02:15:14,070 --> 02:15:17,430
No, you didn't say oh
no. That's hilarious.

2162
02:15:18,230 --> 02:15:22,470
You think tough enough. I was
just like, Oh God. Oh God.
Laughs stuff, stuff, stuff,

2163
02:15:22,471 --> 02:15:26,830
stuff. Tab Click. Thank God I can
screw up on the guitar now and I get

2164
02:15:28,920 --> 02:15:30,810
terrible. No one notice. Yeah.

2165
02:15:30,830 --> 02:15:34,480
When you're talking about it in front of
a million people, but they don't know.

2166
02:15:34,680 --> 02:15:37,070
They don't even know who we are.
They're like, there's a girl with,

2167
02:15:37,110 --> 02:15:40,950
with hair and on her head
and she's got a banjo.

2168
02:15:41,430 --> 02:15:42,263
That's all they saw.

2169
02:15:45,200 --> 02:15:46,033
Okay.

2170
02:15:48,010 --> 02:15:51,430
This is a crazy thing
about show crow though too,

2171
02:15:51,431 --> 02:15:54,970
is that she goes up there and she,
she has this brain tumor.

2172
02:15:54,971 --> 02:15:59,890
She's a brain tumor right now. Is it a
city have to be operated? It's benign,

2173
02:15:59,891 --> 02:16:04,560
but she's, she forgets stuff
so she has um, what it's true.

2174
02:16:04,840 --> 02:16:08,650
She owns up to it. That's the thing.
She goes up there and she's like,

2175
02:16:08,980 --> 02:16:11,260
if she forgets a word,
she says I got a brain tumor.

2176
02:16:11,530 --> 02:16:15,120
But the fact that she goes up on stage,
um,

2177
02:16:15,220 --> 02:16:18,850
with the knowledge that she could
forget the lyrics are not knowing.

2178
02:16:18,851 --> 02:16:22,980
I think that takes a huge amount of
lady balls. Lady lady balls hitting.

2179
02:16:23,830 --> 02:16:26,810
Yes, it definitely does. Yeah.
It's just an amazing thing.

2180
02:16:26,960 --> 02:16:29,950
80 bucks does turn you on,
Brian.

2181
02:16:30,640 --> 02:16:35,170
Let's talk about that.
What else are you feeling ladies?

2182
02:16:35,320 --> 02:16:40,210
Triangles.
Nags,

2183
02:16:40,690 --> 02:16:44,920
nags, cut off. I started drinking.
Awesome. You did good for you.

2184
02:16:44,950 --> 02:16:49,820
Did you have some of the hunting JD?
No, I had a fake captain. Morgan's

2185
02:16:51,900 --> 02:16:55,410
staff. That, is that the stuff that
you said you were going to drink? Oh,

2186
02:16:55,411 --> 02:16:59,470
that's what I was talking about.
I didn't know what that means.

2187
02:17:02,560 --> 02:17:07,000
I've never heard of this.
Delicious hammered the last
time we were on your show.

2188
02:17:07,730 --> 02:17:10,330
It was a great time.
We had a great time too.

2189
02:17:12,640 --> 02:17:14,470
Okay, good. A manager just emailed us.

2190
02:17:14,471 --> 02:17:16,870
I thought he's going to be
like step acting like idiots.

2191
02:17:17,800 --> 02:17:21,860
Why would you ever listen to anybody?
Don't ever listen to anybody tells you.

2192
02:17:23,280 --> 02:17:27,720
Definitely can't get it right you guys,
you know what you're doing.

2193
02:17:27,730 --> 02:17:31,420
Just trust your instincts. Go with
the flow and use the force. Luke,

2194
02:17:32,660 --> 02:17:36,070
we're gonna finish this bottle of
booze and go streaking down Pasadena.

2195
02:17:36,820 --> 02:17:39,970
That's who you really want to do.
But if you do it,

2196
02:17:39,971 --> 02:17:43,000
it means that you really wanted to do it.
And then she just fucking do it.

2197
02:17:44,040 --> 02:17:46,390
I don't think I've ever gone
streaking good then. Don't do it.

2198
02:17:47,170 --> 02:17:49,120
If it doesn't feel like that's
what you should be doing.

2199
02:17:50,100 --> 02:17:52,360
There's some crazy bitch and wants to
take off her clothes and run down the

2200
02:17:52,361 --> 02:17:55,810
street. What's wrong with that? I say
nothing. Keep my boots on. You know,

2201
02:17:56,410 --> 02:17:57,370
as long as you're not hurt,
I don't know.

2202
02:17:58,430 --> 02:18:01,950
That's a good mood and you
should probably just one screen.

2203
02:18:02,020 --> 02:18:06,660
So naked with that sounds so dangerous.
Hey Joe, can I hit that joint? Um,

2204
02:18:06,700 --> 02:18:08,290
I don't know where it is.
Oh,

2205
02:18:11,250 --> 02:18:13,480
you think we should be higher
for listening to his songs?

2206
02:18:14,710 --> 02:18:19,690
I want to talk about the crazy dude. A
crazy dude. What are you talking about?

2207
02:18:19,691 --> 02:18:22,540
I really, I can I read an email?
Yes, please. Wait a minute.

2208
02:18:22,541 --> 02:18:25,310
Are you sure you want
to do this? I am. No,

2209
02:18:26,200 --> 02:18:29,590
you were talking about crazy encounters
with people. This is fun to me.

2210
02:18:29,591 --> 02:18:30,424
This is really funny.

2211
02:18:31,180 --> 02:18:35,160
The other day when we had our epic
show I was telling you about in, um,

2212
02:18:35,920 --> 02:18:37,270
in Santa Rosa,
California,

2213
02:18:37,840 --> 02:18:41,800
there was a gentleman that was front and
center and he was really enthusiastic

2214
02:18:41,801 --> 02:18:45,930
to say the least and was so,

2215
02:18:45,940 --> 02:18:50,140
so very complimentary and
genuine at the end of the show.

2216
02:18:50,620 --> 02:18:52,210
And he had said,
hey,

2217
02:18:52,211 --> 02:18:55,450
I would love it if you guys came and
played a show at my house one day.

2218
02:18:55,960 --> 02:18:58,960
And originally we were like,
it's kind of weird, you know,

2219
02:18:58,961 --> 02:19:01,780
people say that you're like,
you know, okay, well that's,
that's a nice sentiment,

2220
02:19:01,781 --> 02:19:04,870
but we want to be careful with
situations like that. And then,

2221
02:19:05,800 --> 02:19:10,480
then the guy's like, I can, you know,
you'd be playing after Steve Miller,

2222
02:19:10,900 --> 02:19:14,280
Steve Miller band. And he's
like, he's like, you know, I can,

2223
02:19:14,340 --> 02:19:18,960
I can afford to pay you. And basically
saying, let them that he's got, you know,

2224
02:19:18,980 --> 02:19:23,170
some, some muon and he
can, he can pay us. Right.

2225
02:19:23,470 --> 02:19:28,370
So then, so then he gets
a little weird. Oh and

2226
02:19:29,000 --> 02:19:32,870
Oh God, where is it? I kind of got
to blow up this guy's spot. No, no,

2227
02:19:32,871 --> 02:19:37,340
I'm not naming any names, but um, it,
it got really, Ben, do you have it?

2228
02:19:37,400 --> 02:19:42,290
There it is. Oh No. Did he
respond? Okay. So, so he,

2229
02:19:42,291 --> 02:19:46,940
he was a little Kooky, like he was dancing
around the front of the stage and um,

2230
02:19:47,580 --> 02:19:50,630
um, then he sends, he talked to our
management and our manager was like,

2231
02:19:50,631 --> 02:19:51,980
this could be really great for you guys.

2232
02:19:52,190 --> 02:19:55,520
And then he sent an email to our
manager and it goes like this, Jeff,

2233
02:19:56,450 --> 02:19:58,460
about honey honey and the lead singer.

2234
02:19:58,610 --> 02:20:01,490
She really needs some help with
the tire starting with her boots.

2235
02:20:01,730 --> 02:20:05,870
She can be one really knocked out gal
if she dressed right as she might have

2236
02:20:05,871 --> 02:20:09,290
noticed. I'm covered with women.
So that is not my interest.

2237
02:20:09,320 --> 02:20:11,900
Her talent is about the lead guitars.

2238
02:20:11,930 --> 02:20:16,730
That would be been his humility on
stage is a great plus about the drummer.

2239
02:20:16,850 --> 02:20:19,970
He should be shown new licks from some
of the greats as he has the potential to

2240
02:20:19,971 --> 02:20:24,680
be one himself about eight for the date
that he wanted us to play the bubble if

2241
02:20:24,681 --> 02:20:25,550
you have any.
Anyway,

2242
02:20:26,090 --> 02:20:31,090
so he had this big fucking spiel about
my boots being a problem and I think my

2243
02:20:32,151 --> 02:20:33,080
boots are fine.

2244
02:20:33,860 --> 02:20:36,080
Really.
Are you really addressing those?

2245
02:20:37,310 --> 02:20:39,550
I mean they smell a little more problems.

2246
02:20:40,650 --> 02:20:43,600
More problems [inaudible] right.

2247
02:20:43,640 --> 02:20:46,510
Thank you for calling
us out about your shoes.

2248
02:20:49,760 --> 02:20:51,830
It's our fault we let him in.
We were hopeful.

2249
02:20:51,831 --> 02:20:55,370
I was literally planning on playing a
show by myself cause Ben couldn't make it

2250
02:20:55,371 --> 02:20:59,840
and then he told me that I wasn't cool
because I'm going to it better crazy

2251
02:20:59,841 --> 02:21:01,290
people antenna and I said,

2252
02:21:01,310 --> 02:21:04,160
you're not cool because it's
pretty obvious with this
dude. This guy was great.

2253
02:21:04,161 --> 02:21:07,520
He writes in the front row. Well then
you should said totally hold though.

2254
02:21:07,560 --> 02:21:11,210
He owed us.
Well it sounds like a rich douche bag.

2255
02:21:11,360 --> 02:21:13,700
There's a lot of those out there.
It's normal.

2256
02:21:14,610 --> 02:21:16,370
You calling us out cause you're right.
We should,

2257
02:21:16,371 --> 02:21:20,900
we should move on from anyone that hates
so silly. What does he give a fuck?

2258
02:21:20,901 --> 02:21:22,280
What you're dressed like?
That's what you'd like to dress.

2259
02:21:22,440 --> 02:21:25,250
I think that's what pisses me off.
It's like you're an idiot. You can't,

2260
02:21:25,400 --> 02:21:27,200
you can't influence.
Like you can't say,

2261
02:21:27,201 --> 02:21:30,110
oh you know you should be in
stilettos and with your fucking toes.

2262
02:21:33,410 --> 02:21:37,840
Just to prove a point where only boots
should wear what you want to wear.

2263
02:21:38,530 --> 02:21:39,500
Red Lizard suit,

2264
02:21:40,760 --> 02:21:44,900
non creative people always
feel like they can fix things.

2265
02:21:44,901 --> 02:21:47,290
Like they could step
in and fix like little,

2266
02:21:47,550 --> 02:21:49,370
you just see me and he
needs a fucking haircut.

2267
02:21:49,371 --> 02:21:53,590
This car because it's like your
problem is the problem isn't the just

2268
02:21:53,600 --> 02:21:55,640
distribution of music.
This young man with his crazy hair

2269
02:21:58,920 --> 02:22:03,790
girl needs to lose weight. No one needs
anything. Look at that. A Dell check.

2270
02:22:04,350 --> 02:22:05,880
I mean it's just all you need is a sound.

2271
02:22:06,000 --> 02:22:08,600
You need the amazing sound from
your voice. People fucking love you.

2272
02:22:08,601 --> 02:22:12,980
Look at Amy Winehouse cracked
out to the end. All fucked up.

2273
02:22:12,981 --> 02:22:16,440
Missing teeth. Amazing
voice. Everybody loved her.

2274
02:22:17,810 --> 02:22:21,400
She didn't look good. She looked crazy.
She looks a lot better now. Shut.

2275
02:22:23,700 --> 02:22:28,360
Cut. Shut up. Right for at
least 15 minutes. You asshole.

2276
02:22:29,250 --> 02:22:31,690
You son of a bitch.
Um,

2277
02:22:32,550 --> 02:22:35,690
at least like three to four
years off your life from Karma.

2278
02:22:37,020 --> 02:22:40,440
She was so interesting because it
was like retro but not, you know,

2279
02:22:40,470 --> 02:22:44,210
like that Rehab Song. What a beautiful
song man. She had an incredible voice

2280
02:22:44,250 --> 02:22:46,470
but that seems, sorry, I
was just going to say I was,

2281
02:22:46,550 --> 02:22:50,140
I was watching her live last night. It
was just thinking about how, you know,

2282
02:22:50,141 --> 02:22:54,700
you see a lot of groups
that are successful kind
of redoing an old sound and

2283
02:22:54,701 --> 02:22:58,300
even if they do a great, it's,
it's, you know, it can be great,

2284
02:22:58,301 --> 02:23:02,410
but she kinda contemporize it. She did
something completely different. Yeah.

2285
02:23:02,440 --> 02:23:03,273
That's amazing.

2286
02:23:03,730 --> 02:23:06,600
So much like we were talking
about earlier about like emotions,

2287
02:23:06,610 --> 02:23:10,510
like traveling through the lyrics and it
doesn't even matter what you're singing

2288
02:23:10,511 --> 02:23:14,170
about if like that the, the
emotion in your mind, you know,

2289
02:23:14,171 --> 02:23:15,400
comes through the words.

2290
02:23:15,401 --> 02:23:19,030
There's like this weird effect
that a song has and with her,

2291
02:23:19,210 --> 02:23:24,190
like she totally nailed that man that I
remember seeing that Rehab video where

2292
02:23:24,191 --> 02:23:27,490
she's sort of swaying on that microphone
while she's saying it. You're like,

2293
02:23:27,850 --> 02:23:30,890
God damn, that bitch has
got some talent. You know,

2294
02:23:30,891 --> 02:23:35,290
she just had this weird new thing,
new thing, next level. Oh Yeah,

2295
02:23:35,291 --> 02:23:39,460
look at this new thing. Crazy
voice talking about she's
not going to go to rehab.

2296
02:23:39,490 --> 02:23:41,040
She's thinking about not going to rehab.
Yeah.

2297
02:23:41,041 --> 02:23:42,850
By that I mean that was the truthful,
you know,

2298
02:23:43,400 --> 02:23:47,620
what's kind of sort of like heartbreaking
and beautiful about it at the same

2299
02:23:47,621 --> 02:23:50,800
time as that, that was like, that
wasn't somebody being like, Hey,

2300
02:23:50,801 --> 02:23:54,190
let me write a pop song that everybody's
going to want to buy and listen to and

2301
02:23:54,191 --> 02:23:55,960
sounds really trendy right now.

2302
02:23:55,960 --> 02:24:00,430
That wasn't some sort of generic kind
of regurgitation of what's already been

2303
02:24:00,431 --> 02:24:05,320
done. That was, that was somebody
being honest in, you know, it's,

2304
02:24:05,321 --> 02:24:10,030
uh, it's very interesting and
powerful because that woman, um,

2305
02:24:10,670 --> 02:24:13,240
if I think if, if you were to
look really closely, didn't,

2306
02:24:13,930 --> 02:24:17,950
didn't really care too much about
the other side of like the attention.

2307
02:24:17,951 --> 02:24:22,420
I think she just really wanted to be
loved and she was an artist, you know,

2308
02:24:22,480 --> 02:24:27,310
and cause, you know, she, she talks a
lot about heartbreak or talked and, um,

2309
02:24:27,490 --> 02:24:31,350
there, there's a really
interesting thing that, um,

2310
02:24:31,570 --> 02:24:36,170
I think about a lot. I saw this
really sad youtube video of, um,

2311
02:24:36,520 --> 02:24:40,150
when she kind of got carried off stage,
she was playing in Serbia,

2312
02:24:41,230 --> 02:24:43,990
and this is about a week before she died.

2313
02:24:44,620 --> 02:24:48,730
She'd started a tour and she came
out and was like, hello, Athens.

2314
02:24:48,731 --> 02:24:53,140
And she's in Serbia. And, um, it's
like clearly inebriated on, you know,

2315
02:24:53,141 --> 02:24:57,070
beyond belief and falling over,
can't, can't sing. And um, you know,

2316
02:24:59,080 --> 02:25:03,880
it's an interesting thing to think about
the fact that no one put her into some

2317
02:25:03,881 --> 02:25:08,881
sort of facility immediately
upon that circumstance alone.

2318
02:25:09,400 --> 02:25:13,960
But you know, when you think about all of
her art, it was like, people were like,

2319
02:25:13,961 --> 02:25:16,460
yeah, I love the song as a
club hit. It was a radio hit,

2320
02:25:16,600 --> 02:25:19,510
single number one billboard,
everything.

2321
02:25:19,540 --> 02:25:23,620
And then if you really don't look closely,
it's like that was, is that the Ah,

2322
02:25:23,640 --> 02:25:24,040
Shit,

2323
02:25:24,040 --> 02:25:29,020
you know? Um, it's like that was real.

2324
02:25:30,240 --> 02:25:34,720
Um, and you know not to, to bring it
down low. Yeah. I think that's a show.

2325
02:25:35,250 --> 02:25:39,040
Um, yeah, she starts taking her shoes
off and shit. Oh yeah, I saw this.

2326
02:25:39,550 --> 02:25:43,570
And you know, it's just like
some, somebody just take her home.

2327
02:25:43,600 --> 02:25:48,600
She's got a rob bad mixture. Yeah. Give
her a cup of coffee, get it back out.

2328
02:25:48,601 --> 02:25:53,390
So Redman, say something funny, little
slap on the ass, you know, look, um,

2329
02:25:53,470 --> 02:25:56,560
do you, do you see that shit and then
you see it as like, well, you know,

2330
02:25:56,561 --> 02:25:58,090
there's the pitfalls of a fame.

2331
02:25:58,091 --> 02:26:01,480
Avoid these roadblocks or do you ever
think that that could ever happen to you?

2332
02:26:01,481 --> 02:26:06,130
You could become Super Amy Winehouse
style famous, really solid family.

2333
02:26:06,131 --> 02:26:07,210
I got a really great

2334
02:26:08,980 --> 02:26:12,760
foundation from Ohio stock or Italian.
They're actually here.

2335
02:26:12,761 --> 02:26:16,450
I'm actually late for dinner, but
yeah, there's my folks and my,

2336
02:26:16,451 --> 02:26:21,220
I've got three sisters and some really
incredible friends and, and Ben, you know,

2337
02:26:21,310 --> 02:26:22,780
and you guys are going to keep
it together no matter what.

2338
02:26:22,810 --> 02:26:24,310
Even if you get Jz type famous,

2339
02:26:26,280 --> 02:26:28,390
don't you become a crack head on my watch?

2340
02:26:29,050 --> 02:26:33,490
If you guys have a giant all like yacht
and dancing girls on the yacht and I

2341
02:26:33,491 --> 02:26:37,160
come visit you and I'll be,
I'll be meditating time,

2342
02:26:37,400 --> 02:26:39,790
we'll have all the fucking
naked chicks and all the booze,

2343
02:26:39,791 --> 02:26:43,330
but we'll be like zen and meditating
on our juice cleanses and shit.

2344
02:26:43,770 --> 02:26:46,570
Don't think the girl supposed to be naked.
That makes it a little classless.

2345
02:26:48,000 --> 02:26:50,980
They're free to do whatever they
want though. We're not going to stop.

2346
02:26:51,150 --> 02:26:54,160
We won't stop them from going
topless if they don't want 10 lines.

2347
02:26:55,990 --> 02:26:59,110
Translucent, undergarments,
translucent undergo.

2348
02:26:59,720 --> 02:27:02,200
Let's not fucking discriminate here.
Do you remember when

2349
02:27:04,380 --> 02:27:07,800
that Tan Lines Brian,

2350
02:27:07,810 --> 02:27:10,410
remember that she member Tan lines
when Tan lines were hot? Huh?

2351
02:27:10,460 --> 02:27:13,570
10 lines are still hot
under the playboy bunny.

2352
02:27:15,790 --> 02:27:20,200
Never did that. Never do that. Good for
you. But a lot of girls in high school,

2353
02:27:20,380 --> 02:27:24,170
I did good for them to
expressing them.

2354
02:27:26,800 --> 02:27:27,770
You know what sucks about

2355
02:27:30,880 --> 02:27:35,620
burned yesterday cause I was
walking outside without Brian.

2356
02:27:36,420 --> 02:27:37,720
What sucks about spray tanning?

2357
02:27:38,410 --> 02:27:41,460
Because your bed looks
like Garfield died in it.

2358
02:27:45,130 --> 02:27:47,820
It's like an orange streak in your,

2359
02:27:50,890 --> 02:27:53,980
what do you think's going to happen
once they have the ability to actually

2360
02:27:53,981 --> 02:27:56,650
physically altered the way you look?
Because they're working on that now.

2361
02:27:56,720 --> 02:28:00,310
Like they're working on all sorts of
different, no, no. Genetic engineering

2362
02:28:01,960 --> 02:28:05,910
change. People's genomes change.
Whatever that is. The DNA change,

2363
02:28:06,070 --> 02:28:07,330
whatever the fuck they
gonna be able to change.

2364
02:28:07,420 --> 02:28:08,970
But they're gonna be able
to do something where they

2365
02:28:10,820 --> 02:28:13,150
could turn black like a gorilla.

2366
02:28:14,980 --> 02:28:19,930
That'd be cool to be black like a every
Friday, like black Friday wouldn't be the,

2367
02:28:19,931 --> 02:28:21,410
you keep changing back and forth.

2368
02:28:22,850 --> 02:28:26,540
Imagine if he tried to keep changing it
back and forth. Your Dna just kept going

2369
02:28:28,140 --> 02:28:29,760
more and more fucked up.
You like,

2370
02:28:29,790 --> 02:28:32,340
I want to try to be an old man for one
day just to see what it's going to be

2371
02:28:32,341 --> 02:28:37,230
like. Oh Benjamin button on their asses.
Yeah, I do that. It's called October.

2372
02:28:37,960 --> 02:28:42,320
Twice. What? Justin
October. Moving on. Yeah,

2373
02:28:42,330 --> 02:28:46,170
we've lost ourselves there. I know.
Where are you going to take mommy?

2374
02:28:46,171 --> 02:28:48,210
You're going to go to the olive garden.
Oh,

2375
02:28:51,250 --> 02:28:55,150
let me tell you something. Even
know what just happened. Come on.

2376
02:28:55,580 --> 02:28:58,830
They don't got trolled. This is, he
does it. He mentions all of garden,

2377
02:28:59,630 --> 02:29:03,370
a verbal trial. He even mentions
the olive garden banks. It's cute.

2378
02:29:03,371 --> 02:29:05,770
He sneaks on my family.
My family owns an Italian restaurant.

2379
02:29:05,840 --> 02:29:08,030
Did it's like son of a
bitch. 40 years. Yeah,

2380
02:29:08,100 --> 02:29:10,680
my grandparents started so
they rate the off garden.

2381
02:29:10,950 --> 02:29:12,780
Well they don't hate the olive garden,
but it's like,

2382
02:29:12,781 --> 02:29:17,190
that's like saying um hey guys, thanks
for coming to California. Let's go to,

2383
02:29:17,280 --> 02:29:20,490
let's go to Mcdonald's. Yeah, but they
can appreciate the value. You know,

2384
02:29:20,491 --> 02:29:22,560
you're saving their daughter some
money cause I'm going to have endless

2385
02:29:22,561 --> 02:29:27,120
breadsticks there. Red Van, red van.
Once again, you're put back in timeout.

2386
02:29:27,630 --> 02:29:30,330
Okay. Fellow Ohio stock. I know,

2387
02:29:30,360 --> 02:29:34,860
that's why I'm saying let's stick with
the local businesses. Oh, he's a camel.

2388
02:29:35,130 --> 02:29:36,610
He's from a different part of my castle.

2389
02:29:36,670 --> 02:29:40,980
I do like white castle and
in and out all east coast.

2390
02:29:40,981 --> 02:29:44,370
That's not just Ohio, right. John,
can you do me big chains now?

2391
02:29:44,450 --> 02:29:47,210
I'm a fan of the chain and woman.

2392
02:29:47,230 --> 02:29:51,360
I tried gardening of all the states.

2393
02:29:51,361 --> 02:29:53,970
I think honestly I'm going
to Texas and Ohio. Oh wait.

2394
02:29:54,210 --> 02:29:58,470
Oh well there's a lot of them out here.
They stick together. These Ohio freaks.

2395
02:29:58,471 --> 02:30:02,810
They like resilience. We do. We're
mobilizing. We're here in the west coast.

2396
02:30:03,030 --> 02:30:07,180
They call it the Midwest
Mafia. Harlow. Um,

2397
02:30:07,500 --> 02:30:11,580
so will you play Ohio and then we'll
wrap this bitch up, bring it into shore.

2398
02:30:11,840 --> 02:30:12,960

2399
02:30:22,900 --> 02:30:26,450
Oh Hi. That's good. That's real good.

We love you all and thank you
everyone in Calgary. Oh, before we go,

2463
02:37:14,740 --> 02:37:18,620
I just to play this back for the people
in Calgary, because this was for real,

2464
02:37:18,621 --> 02:37:22,190
one of the craziest fucking crowds.
We had two crazy crowds.

2465
02:37:22,191 --> 02:37:25,910
We sold out this place called the Jack
Singer concert hall. And this is a,

2466
02:37:26,450 --> 02:37:29,090
this is me going on stage and coward
cause it's just so ridiculous.

2467
02:37:34,640 --> 02:37:35,473
Hello.

2468
02:37:35,990 --> 02:37:39,580
This is probably the craziest
crowd I've ever been.

2469
02:37:39,581 --> 02:37:42,520
There's like I've ever been in front
of my life because people are insane.

2470
02:37:45,210 --> 02:37:46,043
Okay.

2471
02:38:04,350 --> 02:38:06,000
They're fucking savages.

2472
02:38:09,280 --> 02:38:13,720
So the crowd was so crazy to 20 dudes
got kicked out for being hammered and

2473
02:38:13,721 --> 02:38:14,440
heckling.

2474
02:38:14,440 --> 02:38:17,980
And at the end of the show
I get a standing ovation and
when everybody stands up,

2475
02:38:17,981 --> 02:38:22,650
one guy pulls his dick out and starts
a on the people in front of them. Yes.

2476
02:38:22,900 --> 02:38:26,200
And there's a video of people
punching him in the face.

02:38:26,410 --> 02:38:28,720
This is a video of that guy
getting punched in the face.

2478
02:38:28,721 --> 02:38:32,350
It's on my Twitter feed from a couple
of, couple of days ago. It was awesome.

2479
02:38:32,440 --> 02:38:32,981
Calgary,

2480
02:38:32,981 --> 02:38:37,810
you people with a shit even just look 20
Douche bags out of a crowd to crowds of

2481
02:38:37,811 --> 02:38:41,070
2000 people. It's fucking great
numbers. People are going, I'm sorry.

2482
02:38:41,100 --> 02:38:43,780
Those people ruined your time at Calgary.
Nobody ruined anything.

2483
02:38:43,781 --> 02:38:45,790
I had a great fucking time.
It was amazing.

2484
02:38:45,791 --> 02:38:49,150
Calgary was the shit and the guys
who got kicked out, you know,

2485
02:38:49,151 --> 02:38:52,240
they just got too drunk.
The intermission was a terrible idea to,

2486
02:38:52,241 --> 02:38:55,000
there's an information. Anyway, so it
was over. We'll see you guys smile.

2487
02:38:55,510 --> 02:38:57,080
You're not your calling.

2488
02:39:10,990 --> 02:39:11,823
Okay.

2489
02:39:38,820 --> 02:39:38,860
Yeah.
