00:00:02,130 --> 00:00:06,540
Hello Freak bitches were back.
This episode is brought to you by ting.

2
00:00:06,570 --> 00:00:10,100
Ting is the official cell phone provider
for the Jews and his name is boss.

3
00:00:10,101 --> 00:00:13,470
You guys. Uh, Ting is a cell phone
provider. I've got one right here.

4
00:00:13,471 --> 00:00:18,030
This is the thing phone.
This is my Samsung Galaxy
note five. It's pretty dope.

5
00:00:18,440 --> 00:00:20,580
Uh, I liked the fingerprint
thing. It's pretty sweet.

6
00:00:20,900 --> 00:00:22,710
The fingerprint thing is sweet and um,

7
00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:26,670
the fact that it's waterproof is
pretty sweet too. Um, what it is,

8
00:00:26,671 --> 00:00:30,900
is with ting uses is the sprint backbone.
These a sprint network,

9
00:00:30,901 --> 00:00:35,850
but they do it their way with no
contracts, no early termination fees,

10
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:38,580
no ride alongs or bundling and no,

11
00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:41,490
no bullshit that you
ordinarily have to deal with.

12
00:00:41,491 --> 00:00:44,190
If you deal with most
cell phone providers,

13
00:00:44,191 --> 00:00:48,510
most cell phone providers also have
their billing setup for what they say.

14
00:00:48,511 --> 00:00:51,720
If you have a hundred minutes a month,
but you only use like 10,

15
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:53,970
which is by the way,
what you probably use,

16
00:00:54,150 --> 00:00:56,010
most people don't fucking
call anybody anymore.

17
00:00:56,220 --> 00:00:57,780
You call someone for 10 minutes a month,

18
00:00:57,781 --> 00:01:00,060
you're a Weirdo unless
you're doing business.

19
00:01:00,340 --> 00:01:03,660
My understanding if you're doing
business. Um, but the point is with Ting,

20
00:01:03,810 --> 00:01:06,570
you only pay for what you use.

21
00:01:06,930 --> 00:01:10,530
They used to have it so that like they
would credit you and your next bill and

22
00:01:10,531 --> 00:01:12,440
knock money off your next
bill if you didn't hit them,

23
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:15,870
they're ordered a hundred
minutes but you only used 80.

24
00:01:15,871 --> 00:01:18,390
They would credit you that in your
next bill. But then they realize like,

25
00:01:18,391 --> 00:01:21,000
why are we doing that? Why don't we
just charge you for what you use?

26
00:01:21,030 --> 00:01:24,990
Like that's the most logical way to do it.
And that's how Tim does it now.

27
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:28,590
So I think every cell phone companies
are going to be forced to do it that way.

28
00:01:28,591 --> 00:01:30,960
Cause that's what it should be.
If you use more, you pay more.

29
00:01:31,290 --> 00:01:34,920
But if you're like a heavy data user,
especially ting is an awesome way to go.

30
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:35,821
Ting uh,

31
00:01:35,821 --> 00:01:39,030
actually just dropped their rates because
of their second year anniversary for

32
00:01:39,031 --> 00:01:41,940
no reason other than they got a better
deal and they said, fuck it man.

33
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:47,240
We're going to continue this path of
being an ethical cell phone company with,

34
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:51,990
which is a good idea. The good
ideas, like to not fuck people over,

35
00:01:51,991 --> 00:01:56,991
give them something that's a good service
that you can get at a good rate and

36
00:01:57,001 --> 00:01:59,360
uh, you feel good about the
transaction, whereas, you know,

37
00:01:59,540 --> 00:02:04,350
you get those overage fees or you get
some fucking early termination fee and

38
00:02:04,351 --> 00:02:07,230
it's like hundreds of dollars
and you're like, fuck off man.

39
00:02:07,231 --> 00:02:12,210
You feel robbed while Tane has it set up
so you don't do anything like that. Um,

40
00:02:12,450 --> 00:02:16,260
98% of people would save money with
Tang and that's because they do mobile

41
00:02:16,261 --> 00:02:20,310
differently. The average monthly
bill per device for tin customers,

42
00:02:20,311 --> 00:02:24,240
it's $21. That's a, that's
a pretty fucking cheap.

43
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:29,600
And if you go to rogan.ting.com you will
save $25 off of any of their devices.

44
00:02:30,690 --> 00:02:33,240
They have a wide range of a cell phones,

45
00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:38,660
including a iPhone fives and all the
greatest and latest of the android models,

46
00:02:39,541 --> 00:02:41,910
including the LG nexus five,

47
00:02:41,911 --> 00:02:45,930
the Samsung Galaxy s five,
which is what I got right here.

48
00:02:46,170 --> 00:02:51,000
And the Samsung Galaxy note three.
If you just can't have it big enough.

49
00:02:51,450 --> 00:02:55,710

We're also brought to you by audible.

50
00:02:55,711 --> 00:02:58,830
If you go to audible.com
forward slash Joe,

51
00:02:58,831 --> 00:03:03,831
you can get a free audio book from
the number one provider of audio

52
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:06,040
entertainment on the Internet.

53
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:09,910
Audible has been around for a long fucking
time and I've always been a big fan

54
00:03:09,911 --> 00:03:13,750
of audio books. It makes
it so much easier. And um,

55
00:03:13,930 --> 00:03:18,460
if you have this Amazon kindle
fire HD, Amazon has this, um,

56
00:03:19,030 --> 00:03:23,580
it's one of their, it's their version of
um, you know, like a tablet, like a, a,

57
00:03:23,581 --> 00:03:27,690
a galaxy tablet. And wait, if
you get one of those from Amazon,

58
00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:30,190
the kindle fire HD and you get
this thing called whisper sync,

59
00:03:30,220 --> 00:03:34,660
it's fucking crazy. You read the book. So
if you're at home, you're sitting in bed,

60
00:03:34,661 --> 00:03:36,640
you read the book,
and then when you get to a certain page,

61
00:03:37,210 --> 00:03:40,990
it syncs up with the audible
version of it in your car.

62
00:03:41,110 --> 00:03:44,800
So you get in your car and then you
listen to the audio version of the book.

63
00:03:45,070 --> 00:03:47,200
So it's like it keeps going for you.

64
00:03:47,230 --> 00:03:50,320
It's like you read when you can and
then they'll read it to you in between,

65
00:03:50,590 --> 00:03:54,400
which I think is pretty fucking awesome.
And if you want a free audio book,

66
00:03:54,580 --> 00:03:57,760
you can pick from over 150,000 titles,

67
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:03,000
including life of the party by our pal
Bert Kreischer actually read by Bert

68
00:04:03,580 --> 00:04:04,120
Kreischer and cool.

69
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:08,620
You can get that shit for free if you
go to audible.com forward slash Joe, uh,

70
00:04:08,621 --> 00:04:10,660
can't say enough good things
about audible. Like I said,

71
00:04:10,661 --> 00:04:15,250
they've been around a long time and they
have over 150,000 books to choose from,

72
00:04:15,460 --> 00:04:19,870
including radio shows, podcasts, comedy
specials, they have all kinds of shit.

73
00:04:19,871 --> 00:04:23,440
They have the opiate Anthony show.
Um, that's not even Anthony anymore.

74
00:04:28,270 --> 00:04:31,110
That's Bert Kreischer think we're violent
and crappy way by planting them in the

75
00:04:31,111 --> 00:04:34,150
guy though. Anyway, audible.com
forward slash Joe go there,

76
00:04:34,151 --> 00:04:39,151
my friends and get yourself a free
audio book and one free month of audible

77
00:04:40,211 --> 00:04:43,450
service. That's right.
Sweet bitches. Amazing.

78
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:46,710
Also were brought to
you by on at.com and we,

79
00:04:46,730 --> 00:04:51,730
right now it is September 3rd and
it is a 3:00 PM west coast time,

80
00:04:52,180 --> 00:04:53,890
which means there's one day,

81
00:04:54,010 --> 00:04:58,330
20 hours and 58 minutes and six seconds,

82
00:04:59,690 --> 00:05:04,390
uh, to go with the 72 hour sale,
72 hour sale, 15% off everything.

83
00:05:04,391 --> 00:05:06,520
You use the code CEP seven two,

84
00:05:06,521 --> 00:05:10,450
it's like the short for September and
then 72 for the amount of hours in the

85
00:05:10,451 --> 00:05:13,480
sale. Uh, if you hear this after that,

86
00:05:13,810 --> 00:05:17,320
then just use the codeword Rogan and
you could save 10% of any and all

87
00:05:17,321 --> 00:05:20,980
supplements, but it doesn't
work on everything. This
code is 15% code right now.

88
00:05:21,010 --> 00:05:24,970
Works on everything, but on it is
as a human optimization website.

89
00:05:25,330 --> 00:05:29,920
That's what we decided to call a website
where we sell shit that does good

90
00:05:29,921 --> 00:05:31,780
things for you.
Whether it's get you in shape,

91
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:36,280
whether it's a give you healthy snack
options like the hemp force protein bar,

92
00:05:36,490 --> 00:05:40,420
super healthy, very delicious,
very good for you. Hemp,

93
00:05:40,450 --> 00:05:44,170
very easy to digest. One of the
easiest proteins to digest. Uh,

94
00:05:44,171 --> 00:05:47,080
we have hemp force powder
and that hemp force powders,

95
00:05:47,081 --> 00:05:50,650
the finest protein powder we could
buy, the most expensive stuff. It's a,

96
00:05:50,710 --> 00:05:54,280
all of it comes from Canada
because the United States is,

97
00:05:54,281 --> 00:05:58,250
I'm a fucking crazy place that will be
mocked in the and the future when they

98
00:05:58,251 --> 00:06:01,340
look back at the marijuana laws and
how preposterous they were and how they

99
00:06:01,341 --> 00:06:02,870
affected its cousin.

100
00:06:02,900 --> 00:06:07,580
It's non psychoactive cousin
hemp and that's what hemp is.

101
00:06:07,930 --> 00:06:11,690
I mean it's not the version of
marijuana that you use to get high.

102
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:16,720
It's a non get you high plant and it's
still illegal because it's related to the

103
00:06:17,061 --> 00:06:19,940
get you high plant.
It's the male version of the species.

104
00:06:19,941 --> 00:06:23,920
The female version of the species
has the um, the buds which you, uh,

105
00:06:23,930 --> 00:06:26,780
you get your THC from. Uh,
to answer your questions,

106
00:06:26,781 --> 00:06:30,110
cause I know a lot of
people have questions about
protein powders that involve

107
00:06:30,111 --> 00:06:34,220
hamp or any products and involve him.
You cannot test positive.

108
00:06:34,580 --> 00:06:37,970
If you have a job that tests you, they
make you pee in a cup. First of all,

109
00:06:37,971 --> 00:06:39,140
if you do have a job like that,

110
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:42,440
strategize your way to get the
fuck out of that fucking jail.

111
00:06:42,590 --> 00:06:47,590
Some Dick Wad doesn't let you take a
hit off a joint on your weekend cause

112
00:06:47,751 --> 00:06:51,680
they're worried about you
losing productivity for your
fucking slave job and on

113
00:06:51,681 --> 00:06:56,540
Monday, fuck them. Set your
phone down. That's fair
enough. Um, no, just answer it.

114
00:06:56,541 --> 00:06:59,750
Start calling people shit. Fuck.
Oh, I want to do this show.

115
00:07:00,950 --> 00:07:05,520
Um, anyway, uh, hemp force.
You can a, you can only,

116
00:07:06,290 --> 00:07:08,810
you can only test positive if you smoke
weed while you're eating hemp force.

117
00:07:09,260 --> 00:07:10,100
But um,

118
00:07:10,340 --> 00:07:15,080
I should tell you that if you eat bagels
that have like poppy seeds on them or

119
00:07:15,081 --> 00:07:18,740
anything with poppy seeds,
you test positive for heroin.
As crazy as that sounds.

120
00:07:18,860 --> 00:07:19,910
But it is absolutely true.

121
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:22,730
If you're going in for a heroin
test or any sort of a drug test,

122
00:07:22,940 --> 00:07:26,720
if you eat poppy seeds, you will test
positive for heroin. It's very strange.

123
00:07:26,990 --> 00:07:27,910
It doesn't happen with hemp.

124
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:33,280
Go to [inaudible] Dot Com oh Anne and

Dot TV for all the new cats that Brian
has put together on hats and cats and

134
00:08:06,321 --> 00:08:08,810
hats and tee shirts and all
kinds of different shit.

135
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:13,840
The Brian has a full fucking selection
of all artwork that he's created.

136
00:08:13,911 --> 00:08:18,320
By the way, if you see all of this stuff
and uh, you, you buy into these things,

137
00:08:18,321 --> 00:08:21,980
you're absolutely supporting the artist
himself because Brian created all these.

138
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:26,180
He put it together and he used our friends
at Squarespace to design this website

139
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:29,150
and to, uh, sell it all,
which has been a pleasure.

140
00:08:29,260 --> 00:08:32,210
It's the best website creator ever.
I mean for the money.

141

155
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:32,400
I got um, September something or
another. I'm in fucking Toronto.

156
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:35,150
Let me find this, cause I didn't
have it in front of me, but uh,

157
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:39,450
we do a messy little Joe. I
am doing the Sony Center. Uh,

158
00:09:39,510 --> 00:09:41,670
I liked Massey Hall but
it was already booked,

159
00:09:42,270 --> 00:09:46,110
but I did the Sony Center before
too, is pretty fucking dope. Yeah.

160
00:09:46,111 --> 00:09:50,550
Sony Center for the Performing Arts with
Tony Hinchcliffe. Friday, September 26.

161
00:09:50,551 --> 00:09:53,110
Jody rose, who was supposed to
be here tomorrow, but he had to,

162
00:09:53,250 --> 00:09:57,750
he got an acting gig. The kids got
talent. You can hold them back.

163
00:09:57,990 --> 00:10:01,800
So Tony has taken his place and Joe
Derosa we'll be here next Wednesday. Uh,

164
00:10:01,801 --> 00:10:05,100
in the future I have Rupert Sheldrake
and Graham Hancock are going to be coming

165
00:10:05,101 --> 00:10:08,310
up. Uh, I got a lot of good
guests. Real solid guests.

166
00:10:08,311 --> 00:10:11,070
Mike Dolce is going to be here
next week. Uh, like I said,

167
00:10:11,340 --> 00:10:14,570
Jodie Ross will be here next week. All
right, that's it. Boom. Schelok lock.

168
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:17,160
Boom Saga. Oh, ice house. Ice House.

169
00:10:17,161 --> 00:10:20,490
I'm going to be at the Ice House in
Pasadena September 12th and 13th.

170
00:10:20,580 --> 00:10:23,910
What does that like the weekend after
this one with Tony Hinchcliffe. All right,

171
00:10:23,911 --> 00:10:26,550
that's it.
Cube's music dominant areas here.

172
00:10:38,110 --> 00:10:41,630
Dominic, me, brother, a
little Joe for fuck sake.

173
00:10:41,830 --> 00:10:45,230
Look at you sitting up there and they
asked me if I was David Letterman and it

174
00:10:45,231 --> 00:10:46,590
will actually tell
everybody about this chair.

175
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:52,140
This is my latest device to try to
mitigate back pain from sitting.

176
00:10:52,141 --> 00:10:56,900
And it's called the uh, I think
it's called a Sally. Yeah. S a l. L.

177
00:10:56,901 --> 00:11:00,240
I and it's a saddle chair.
It's like a saddle.

178
00:11:00,300 --> 00:11:03,270
So if you see how it's sitting
here. No, no one's endorsing this.

179
00:11:03,271 --> 00:11:06,090
I'm just telling you it feels,
I'm going to tell you this.

180
00:11:06,091 --> 00:11:08,520
They would hate me endorsing
this cause it feels like shit.

181
00:11:08,670 --> 00:11:11,010
It's like the least comfortable
chair I think I've ever sat.

182
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:15,900
But it's very good for your back
and makes sure that you like,

183
00:11:15,930 --> 00:11:19,830
you can't sit any way
other than like this.

184
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:22,200
Like you have to sit like straight up.

185
00:11:22,201 --> 00:11:25,200
You can't like slouch in this
thing just doesn't support it.

186
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:28,860
And when I sit in a regular chair,
by the end of the podcast,

187
00:11:28,861 --> 00:11:30,930
my fucking neck starts
to hurt like my back,

188
00:11:30,931 --> 00:11:33,960
like around here where I've
been injured starts to hurt.

189
00:11:34,790 --> 00:11:37,320
What that like stretch your
asshole out though and like give,

190
00:11:37,330 --> 00:11:42,030
that's what I'm trying to do is kind of
easier for if I ever do wind up going in

191
00:11:42,031 --> 00:11:46,290
the pokey. I want to be
just gaping soon. Um, no,

192
00:11:46,291 --> 00:11:49,430
it doesn't do anything in your asshole.
You fucking idiot. You're sitting now.

193
00:11:49,820 --> 00:11:53,010
It's like your bubble. I know.
I'm certainly easy. No, this
is, you're not listening.

194
00:11:53,590 --> 00:11:56,850
The whole idea behind this is it's
like a saddle. If you sit in a salary,

195
00:11:56,851 --> 00:11:58,750
you actually kind of have
to hold yourself in place.

196
00:11:59,020 --> 00:12:02,470
So by squeezing your legs together,
it's not opening your butthole.

197
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:04,390
You're actually squeezing
everything tight.

198
00:12:04,391 --> 00:12:07,210
So if you were a Gao and you
wanted to have one of these,

199
00:12:07,510 --> 00:12:09,160
I figured it would probably
be good for the ova.

200
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:10,900
Jj probably tighten that baby up.

201
00:12:11,260 --> 00:12:15,130
Like women are supposed to like do those
key Glenn not supposed to. Supposed to.

202
00:12:15,131 --> 00:12:17,680
If they care about treaty,
a penis correctly with their vagina,

203
00:12:18,100 --> 00:12:21,550
they do those Kegel exercises where you
squeeze your vagina and you can actually

204
00:12:21,551 --> 00:12:22,384
make it stronger.

205
00:12:22,660 --> 00:12:26,140
There's some crazy bitch and Russia that's
like the world record holder for the

206
00:12:26,141 --> 00:12:27,790
amount of weight she can
carry with her pussy.

207
00:12:28,180 --> 00:12:30,640
But it's something
substantial like 50 pounds.

208
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:33,400
So she shoves a Dildo in her pussy,

209
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:38,640
attaches it to a fucking kettle bell
and a and does squats holding this,

210
00:12:38,651 --> 00:12:39,790
this Dildo in her,

211
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:43,870
in her box just with our shield
puts him like grabbing it like that.

212
00:12:43,980 --> 00:12:48,800
Is anybody else getting hungry? Yeah.
I don't know why I'm getting peckish.

213
00:12:50,030 --> 00:12:52,840
Did you ever hear a
honeysuckle divine? Yes. Yeah.

214
00:12:52,870 --> 00:12:56,220
He's the one that used to shoot ping pong
balls and needed a tuna fish sandwich

215
00:12:56,230 --> 00:12:59,300
with no, where was that at?
Where did she do? She did it.

216
00:12:59,301 --> 00:13:02,360
The truck or their own Philadelphia cause
it was like when we were kids it was

217
00:13:02,361 --> 00:13:05,570
like this big joke about how
many circled the one. But uh,

218
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:08,780
I was up at the rib and they were
shooting a porn and you know,

219
00:13:08,781 --> 00:13:10,520
these porn girls need so much attention.

220
00:13:10,550 --> 00:13:14,150
Obviously they didn't have anything else
to do and there's no more conversation.

221
00:13:14,151 --> 00:13:17,720
So one girl sits in a Bush,
it goes do your trick. You
know the, the, the container.

222
00:13:17,721 --> 00:13:22,460
There's the gores put in jams at
dinner and she's just pops it out.

223
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:25,040
But she paid, she hit the girl
too hard. It was so funny.

224
00:13:25,370 --> 00:13:28,980
Girls faces there and you go boom,
it's getting the girl goes, fuck, ah,

225
00:13:30,290 --> 00:13:31,670
big red mark on her face.

226
00:13:31,940 --> 00:13:35,750
And she explained that she could shoot it
out of her pussy. So hard. It hurt. Yeah.

227
00:13:36,110 --> 00:13:39,470
Did you see that fucking
Mantis shrimp that I posted

228
00:13:39,610 --> 00:13:43,520
on my, uh, my uh, my
Twitter page yesterday? No,

229
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:44,680
you got to see this.

230
00:13:44,770 --> 00:13:48,880
This is the craziest fucking animal
I have ever heard in my life.

231
00:13:49,060 --> 00:13:53,950
If you scroll down, a guy named
Mike Jackson, Esquire, the truth,

232
00:13:53,951 --> 00:13:57,580
Jackson on Twitter sent
this shit to me and it's a,

233
00:13:57,581 --> 00:14:02,020
a murder mantis shrimp.
It's a shrimp that has a builtin weapon.

234
00:14:02,380 --> 00:14:04,750
It's not actually a shrimp.
It's like they explain what it is.

235
00:14:05,170 --> 00:14:06,580
It has a builtin weapon.

236
00:14:06,581 --> 00:14:11,530
Like it has this thing where it's
bodies like got a spring inside of it.

237
00:14:11,531 --> 00:14:16,090
It's got two hammers and it shoots to
hammers out and slams on the like crabs

238
00:14:16,091 --> 00:14:20,830
and killed them and breaks their shells.
Open breaks, open clams and crabs.

239
00:14:21,220 --> 00:14:25,360
It is the wild is looking at the,
in the ocean somewhere. It's called,

240
00:14:25,540 --> 00:14:29,650
they call it the mantis murder shrimp
and they have a video in slow motion

241
00:14:29,651 --> 00:14:34,090
explaining how this shrimp, I never, I
never heard of it either until yesterday.

242
00:14:34,690 --> 00:14:39,160
This guy, uh, who was explaining it, we
should give these guys a youtube page.

243
00:14:39,220 --> 00:14:43,570
Whatever it is, is that him smarter
every day, smarter every day.

244
00:14:43,571 --> 00:14:45,870
That's called mantis murder.
Shrimps Watch, scroll.

245
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:47,410
Scroll it back just a little bit before,

246
00:14:47,411 --> 00:14:49,660
right where you were just a
little bit there and it show you.

247
00:14:49,990 --> 00:14:51,860
Watch how this thing does.
Turn the volume up.

248
00:14:52,190 --> 00:14:53,090
Watch how it comes out.

249
00:14:54,850 --> 00:14:58,970
It wax this crab and fucking kills it.
Fucking knocked it out.

250
00:15:00,260 --> 00:15:04,550
Watch this. Look at this. Isn't that nuts?

251
00:15:04,580 --> 00:15:08,060
It's got two hammers on the
end of its clause. That's cool.

252
00:15:08,390 --> 00:15:10,380
I never do anything like this exist.
Cool.

253
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:12,820
How could that be kept almost
all these years, these years,

254
00:15:13,010 --> 00:15:17,040
there's so many animals. Look at
the crab is smashed, it crashed,

255
00:15:17,210 --> 00:15:19,310
crush the shell of the,
the crab.

256
00:15:19,700 --> 00:15:24,350
It's crazy if that thing has been there
and the ocean is whole time and we never

257
00:15:24,351 --> 00:15:28,610
heard about it until 2014 is too
many things to pay attention to.

258
00:15:28,611 --> 00:15:32,540
What I had come here to this podcast to
learn about shrimps that fuck people up

259
00:15:32,740 --> 00:15:35,870
or fuck things up. Um, yeah.
It's not an actually a shrimp.

260
00:15:35,871 --> 00:15:37,910
It's like something else.
They call it a here. I'll,

261
00:15:37,990 --> 00:15:41,240
I'll Google it and find out what
the fuck it actually is. But uh,

262
00:15:41,390 --> 00:15:46,390
incredible with this is that you're just
finding out about boxing gloves almost.

263
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:50,840
Yeah. Like hammers,
right? Yeah. Look at that.

264
00:15:50,900 --> 00:15:54,560
So the whole goal of the podcast
is smarter every day or the uh,

265
00:15:54,561 --> 00:15:58,090
the show smarter everyday. It's
a really well done show too. Wow.

266
00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:01,700
They did a great job of explaining the
mechanism that this thing has inside of

267
00:16:01,701 --> 00:16:03,740
its body.
It's essentially like a spring.

268
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:07,580
It pulls this thing back and that
it holds it in place and wait.

269
00:16:07,581 --> 00:16:10,820
It's like locked and then when it gets
close to things it just releases it.

270
00:16:10,850 --> 00:16:13,990
Blanches not a hundred. It has to hit
you because it's underwater. Yeah,

271
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:17,600
that's right. Close it them and
deep underwater too. You know,

272
00:16:17,980 --> 00:16:21,290
it's not like it's on the surface. You're
dealing with a lot of pressure. Amazing.

273
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:24,380
Really amazing stuff. The world. Dominic.

274
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:28,490
A jealous that I forget something else.

275
00:16:28,910 --> 00:16:32,990
The last time we worked together we did
kill Tony at the ice house cause I still

276
00:16:32,991 --> 00:16:37,520
don't go to the comedy store, but the Ice
House, a version of kill Tony, you and I,

277
00:16:37,610 --> 00:16:41,780
I that was more fun than I've had
doing a like a podcast and a long time.

278
00:16:41,781 --> 00:16:46,600
That was really fucking fun
and we were crying lists. So
silly, so silly. The, the,

279
00:16:46,690 --> 00:16:49,550
the, the premise behind kill
Tony folks who don't know,

280
00:16:49,790 --> 00:16:53,750
it's a Tony Hinchcliffe and Brian red
band have this podcast where they do,

281
00:16:54,140 --> 00:16:55,670
everybody does like a minute,

282
00:16:55,671 --> 00:16:58,280
like you have new comics that go up
and do a minute and they have these two

283
00:16:58,281 --> 00:17:01,670
girls were their names again, Sarah
wine shank. Then Kimberly condom.

284
00:17:01,700 --> 00:17:06,140
Very funny gals who do a free,
not a free,

285
00:17:06,180 --> 00:17:08,960
a new rather minute every week,

286
00:17:09,230 --> 00:17:13,280
which if you've ever done
standup before, it's hard. Yeah.

287
00:17:13,281 --> 00:17:14,960
It sounds like a new man.
It's easy, but you know,

288
00:17:14,961 --> 00:17:17,210
they don't get a chance to really
develop it just every week.

289
00:17:17,211 --> 00:17:20,150
They do and do minute and they've
done that since the very beginning.

290
00:17:20,420 --> 00:17:25,420
So their entire standup
career has essentially been
just doing stand up on the

291
00:17:25,821 --> 00:17:30,710
internet in front of everybody that takes
balls. It does. But I was a little mean,

292
00:17:30,711 --> 00:17:33,380
I thought, but I was just
having fun. Yeah. I had to be,

293
00:17:33,530 --> 00:17:37,400
if you've got to go for the jug,
you'll uh, go for the juggler.

294
00:17:38,940 --> 00:17:42,380
I love guys that had a minute and they
came up like with 35 seconds. Yeah.

295
00:17:42,381 --> 00:17:46,180
They couldn't fill a minute and were
like, okay, are you guys from like,

296
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:48,980
well if you stare at your mirror
and you practice for a minute,

297
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:51,450
it's most likely not really going to
be a minute when you're up to cause you

298
00:17:51,460 --> 00:17:52,231
gotta be panicking.

299
00:17:52,231 --> 00:17:56,940
You'd be talking faster or do
you ever get nervous anymore?

300
00:17:57,930 --> 00:18:01,760
Ask me that. Yeah, I got nervous
for a film my special in Denver. Uh,

301
00:18:01,790 --> 00:18:04,830
definitely a kid. Yeah, I got a little
eh. Yeah. Cause I was probably good work.

302
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:08,010
So hard for it. Yeah. It worked
out great, but it was just,

303
00:18:08,011 --> 00:18:10,500
it was so much a preparation for it.

304
00:18:10,501 --> 00:18:13,680
I definitely felt more
intense than a regular show.

305
00:18:13,710 --> 00:18:18,150
Not like you're big and uh, yeah.
I did it a small place though.

306
00:18:18,220 --> 00:18:21,020
Did it at the comedy works well that's
where I'm going this week. This month.

307
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:23,900
Love that place. I did. He'd do
a good downtown or to the cruise.

308
00:18:23,901 --> 00:18:27,510
She downtown the cruise ship. That's
it. It's like the other place.

309
00:18:27,540 --> 00:18:29,700
Why do you say it's like you're just
like a giant cause it all, it has,

310
00:18:29,701 --> 00:18:31,860
everything has like movie theaters,

311
00:18:32,570 --> 00:18:36,480
restaurants and it's all in one little
block. Oh, I see what you're saying. Yeah.

312
00:18:36,510 --> 00:18:38,850
Downtown is like funkier.
Yeah.

313
00:18:39,010 --> 00:18:43,140
Well downtown's smaller too and it's
like you're stuffed into that really cool

314
00:18:43,141 --> 00:18:47,580
room. That room is special in event.
Well, yeah. Yeah, yeah. That's good idea.

315
00:18:47,610 --> 00:18:51,660
It was fun. I think it's better than
a theater. I think so too. Well, my,

316
00:18:51,690 --> 00:18:55,650
my thought process behind it
was that when you're at home,

317
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:58,170
you're in your living room, your
living room, it's very intimate.

318
00:18:58,410 --> 00:18:59,550
You're sitting down or you know,

319
00:18:59,551 --> 00:19:04,050
maybe your downloaded on your computer
or you're in your office. But either way,

320
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:06,780
you're,
you're in a small environment usually,

321
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:10,980
and you're sitting there watching like
some guy on stage in front of thousands

322
00:19:10,981 --> 00:19:14,460
of people. It doesn't feel, I mean
it's still a good show. Like you can,

323
00:19:14,461 --> 00:19:18,630
you can enjoy it, but you don't feel
like you're there. No, but I watched, um,

324
00:19:18,990 --> 00:19:20,040
I've seen a couple of people doing,

325
00:19:20,041 --> 00:19:23,600
like Sarah Silverman had
once she did it Largo and uh,

326
00:19:23,790 --> 00:19:27,480
I didn't watch too much of it, but I was
like, wow, that feels good. Like that.

327
00:19:27,481 --> 00:19:32,010
She's all in tight like that. It feels
good. Like to watch a show where you're,

328
00:19:32,011 --> 00:19:34,830
you know, you're kind of like
right there. So I decided to do it.

329
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:35,611
I think it's good.

330
00:19:35,611 --> 00:19:40,110
I had this discussion to be a name dropper
with tosh and with Seinfeld and both

331
00:19:40,111 --> 00:19:44,220
of them think theaters are better. And I
just disagree. And even for Tasha. Zach,

332
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:46,940
I think he's better in a
club. And so I thought, I,

333
00:19:47,130 --> 00:19:49,980
why can't I just sit on my hands? I'm
looking at people, sit on their hands,

334
00:19:49,981 --> 00:19:52,320
listen to me for an hour and a half
because a lot of these people, you know,

335
00:19:52,321 --> 00:19:55,050
it's like I said,
because I'd rather people be drinking.

336
00:19:55,051 --> 00:19:57,680
I'd rather them be a little
distracted and having fun. Right.

337
00:19:57,870 --> 00:20:00,690
Then focus like it's theater.
Yeah.

338
00:20:00,691 --> 00:20:04,050
There's definitely a difference in the
kind of show that you can do to like,

339
00:20:04,051 --> 00:20:06,000
you can't like bang, Bang, Bang, Hammer.

340
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,900
I'm in a theater because the laugh that
you got to wait for it to roll. Oh,

341
00:20:09,540 --> 00:20:13,320
fucks over the punchlines. I went
to see Louis Black Mean Joey. Uh,

342
00:20:13,321 --> 00:20:17,820
we were staying at this place in Jersey
and we were doing the theater the next

343
00:20:17,820 --> 00:20:18,990
day.
He was doing it on Thursday.

344
00:20:18,991 --> 00:20:22,410
We were doing our Friday and we went
in to watch and I was like, wow.

345
00:20:22,411 --> 00:20:24,930
Like when a guy's on stage,
um,

346
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:27,540
doing like telling jokes
when people start laughing,

347
00:20:27,541 --> 00:20:30,530
you don't hear anything else he says
until that laughter stopped. Yeah.

348
00:20:30,780 --> 00:20:33,900
And I never realized that because
obviously you're on stage,

349
00:20:33,901 --> 00:20:37,410
you have the microphone,
get the monitors broadcast in your face.

350
00:20:37,590 --> 00:20:41,310
So you hear yourself very loud and clear.
But the audience,

351
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:46,170
they don't hear you very good when people
are laughing. It's real weird to share.

352
00:20:46,290 --> 00:20:47,530
And then we be,

353
00:20:47,531 --> 00:20:51,220
it's Madison Square Garden and places
like that and you really had to wait for

354
00:20:51,221 --> 00:20:54,850
the wave to come by because otherwise
you ready, you're talking over yourself,

355
00:20:54,851 --> 00:20:56,370
you're talking over the left.
Yeah,

356
00:20:56,380 --> 00:20:58,750
you talk over the laugh and
you kill all the taglines.

357
00:20:58,910 --> 00:21:01,060
Anything after the punch line,
which you know,

358
00:21:01,450 --> 00:21:06,100
but some of those taglines like they have
to be done very quickly on in a comedy

359
00:21:06,101 --> 00:21:07,240
club,
but for it to work.

360
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:11,170
So there's a totally different kind of
timing in a theater that like a joke

361
00:21:11,171 --> 00:21:15,370
won't work as well in some ways because
like sometimes you say something and

362
00:21:15,371 --> 00:21:17,400
then he'd say something else and you say
something, he'd say something out like,

363
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:20,530
like those, like everybody's laughing at
the first thing. Then the second thing,

364
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:24,780
like in a theater, you have to say
it, say it. You know there's a,

365
00:21:24,790 --> 00:21:28,960
there's a big pause and that timing
gets funky. Totally different. Yeah.

366
00:21:29,230 --> 00:21:31,690
I'd much rather do a
club. Yeah, it's the best.

367
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:34,420
It's just you can't make as much
money and that's the difference.

368
00:21:34,450 --> 00:21:38,610
But there's something to like some
clubs or some theaters like uh,

369
00:21:38,650 --> 00:21:42,820
like Massey Hall, we were talking about
Toronto Massey halls. Fucking phenomenal.

370
00:21:42,821 --> 00:21:46,270
Even though it's 3000 plus people,
it's still phenomenal.

371
00:21:46,271 --> 00:21:48,520
It's like it's the right size.
For some reason,

372
00:21:48,910 --> 00:21:52,390
I was there when night we had Jason
Alexander Spf want to do an Improv.

373
00:21:52,391 --> 00:21:57,310
At the end of the show we had to follow
Robert Schimmel talking about cancer and

374
00:21:57,400 --> 00:22:01,270
killing. He was fucking killing.
I said to Jason, I said, Shit,

375
00:22:01,271 --> 00:22:03,790
molds kill and talking about cancer.
What the fuck are we going to do?

376
00:22:03,940 --> 00:22:07,960
Fly around the room.
Yeah.

377
00:22:07,961 --> 00:22:11,020
He had a whole series
like after he almost died,

378
00:22:11,110 --> 00:22:13,910
I saw him in Tempe and he,

379
00:22:13,911 --> 00:22:17,620
he had all this material
about almost dying.

380
00:22:17,740 --> 00:22:19,330
You know about like he would bring up.
Brilliant.

381
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:22,420
Do you have to be to make that
funny? He's honest as fuck, man.

382
00:22:22,421 --> 00:22:26,910
That guy was honest as fuck. He was such
a sweet guy too. I ran into him, uh,

383
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:31,390
after all the cancer stuff, you know, he,
he'd survived it and piece really skinny.

384
00:22:31,780 --> 00:22:35,110
I ran into him at um,
uh, Barnes and noble man,

385
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:39,100
just randomly and he's so warm,
so friendly.

386
00:22:39,670 --> 00:22:42,760
That really fucking bum me out.
That bummed me out.

387
00:22:42,761 --> 00:22:46,390
The Robin Williams thing really
bummed me out recently and Richard,

388
00:22:46,391 --> 00:22:49,330
Jenny really bummed me out. Those
are, those are the big three.

389
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:51,010
I didn't see it come
on with Robert at all.

390
00:22:51,060 --> 00:22:56,060
I mean he was supposed to do my podcast
now and I was just going to call him the

391
00:22:56,771 --> 00:22:58,140
silver.
It had a life work today,

392
00:22:58,750 --> 00:23:02,950
well around this week because
what happened was I didn't
call him because I knew

393
00:23:02,951 --> 00:23:06,550
he was upset about the series
not getting picked up and he had,

394
00:23:06,850 --> 00:23:09,400
he had to go back home. These kids
are going to school or whatever,

395
00:23:09,401 --> 00:23:11,440
something was going on in his life.
I said, letting me leave him alone.

396
00:23:11,441 --> 00:23:16,210
I'll call him next week. There
wasn't an next week. Fuck yeah.

397
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:20,260
And I had to go on CNN and I
fucking hated it because it just,

398
00:23:20,261 --> 00:23:23,650
it just find out a buddy who was dies
and they want to talk about suicide and

399
00:23:23,651 --> 00:23:27,220
hell, he did it. And brain chemistry.
I said, look, I, I'm sad right now.

400
00:23:27,221 --> 00:23:27,761
I don't want to really,

401
00:23:27,761 --> 00:23:32,170
I want to go into this a chemical bullshit
and theory about why can we give them

402
00:23:32,171 --> 00:23:36,130
a moment. Yeah. Dana
Gould wrote a piece for,

403
00:23:36,131 --> 00:23:39,550
I think it was for rolling
stone that, uh, I also, uh,

404
00:23:39,610 --> 00:23:43,030
tweeted yesterday,
let me find it here,

405
00:23:43,031 --> 00:23:46,310
but it is pretty detailed
piece about, um, why

406
00:23:46,310 --> 00:23:50,150
so many comedians are depressed and I
thought brain's behaving badly. Yeah.

407
00:23:50,151 --> 00:23:53,120
It's for rolling stone.
And Dana who is not just a funny,

408
00:23:53,180 --> 00:23:57,920
really funny comic I've known
forever, but very bright guy, very,

409
00:23:57,921 --> 00:24:00,860
very insightful. And
uh, he wrote this, uh,

410
00:24:00,950 --> 00:24:05,360
interesting thing after the whole
Robin Williams thing, you know,

411
00:24:05,930 --> 00:24:09,770
he said something so funny to me.
Uh, we were at the left factory,

412
00:24:10,250 --> 00:24:14,580
I did this bit about mother and daughter
Exchange Club lesbians taking care of

413
00:24:14,581 --> 00:24:18,230
her younger girls sexually.
Right. And vice versa. And I,

414
00:24:18,270 --> 00:24:21,060
there was two lesbians there.
I said, yeah. Did you ever
see it? One of the women?

415
00:24:21,080 --> 00:24:25,580
Yeah, yeah, I've seen, I set a time,
ain't it? It's perverted. And so, and I,

416
00:24:25,590 --> 00:24:28,340
I say something about Dana,
you know,

417
00:24:28,341 --> 00:24:31,270
being married and I get them and they
sit down with him because he's done.

418
00:24:31,271 --> 00:24:33,730
I'm like, guys, I'm, I read 12
years. Of course I fucking seen,

419
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:38,510
that's one of my favorites.
Dan is a funny guy, man.

420
00:24:39,190 --> 00:24:43,380
The thing about the Robin and
also about rich Jenny that I, uh,

421
00:24:43,830 --> 00:24:46,140
it's not in my wheelhouse
is the depression thing.

422
00:24:46,650 --> 00:24:49,320
Both those guys suffer from
pretty severe depression.

423
00:24:49,350 --> 00:24:51,420
And the more people we talked to,

424
00:24:51,421 --> 00:24:55,230
we had Carrie Santa Maria on last week
who was a friend of ours. He's very,

425
00:24:55,231 --> 00:25:00,180
very smart, very brilliant woman,
and also a neuroscientist. So,

426
00:25:00,210 --> 00:25:00,421
you know,

427
00:25:00,421 --> 00:25:03,960
she's not talking out of her ass when
she explains what's going on in the human

428
00:25:03,961 --> 00:25:07,140
brain. It's just a fucking
disease, man. It's a disease.

429
00:25:07,141 --> 00:25:11,340
And anybody that doesn't have it that
talks out of their ass, you know,

430
00:25:11,341 --> 00:25:13,770
like fucking what's his face?

431
00:25:13,771 --> 00:25:17,490
Henry Rollins said that it was like week
that he killed himself because he had

432
00:25:17,491 --> 00:25:20,610
kids. Not that these people, you know, I,

433
00:25:20,680 --> 00:25:25,260
I see that they want to take a stand
because they find it offensive that Pete

434
00:25:25,410 --> 00:25:28,860
people would be in their eyes what they
would consider so selfish that they

435
00:25:28,861 --> 00:25:33,570
committed suicide. But I think in
talking to people that have had it,

436
00:25:33,870 --> 00:25:36,360
I think it's pretty safe to assume
they're telling you the truth,

437
00:25:36,510 --> 00:25:40,680
that they can't do it. They can't keep
going. Like these motherfuckers when,

438
00:25:40,920 --> 00:25:44,790
when they don't get help, when they don't
get some sort of a chemical help or,

439
00:25:44,910 --> 00:25:47,220
you know, whatever, whatever
it needs to be done,

440
00:25:47,221 --> 00:25:48,990
whether it's at some sort
of a mental imbalance,

441
00:25:48,991 --> 00:25:51,300
whether it can be mitigated
with exercise or diet,

442
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:56,400
but whatever that state they're in, when
they hit the bottom, they can't go on.

443
00:25:56,401 --> 00:26:00,990
Man. It's, I don't, I don't understand it.
I don't have it. I don't get depressed.

444
00:26:01,280 --> 00:26:03,880
Yeah. I get it to you in
the morning. Yeah. Uh,

445
00:26:03,980 --> 00:26:07,600
then it kind of worked my way out
of it. Uh, the jerky way out of it.

446
00:26:07,690 --> 00:26:11,650
Your to put way up and I stay
in little things in my house.

447
00:26:13,350 --> 00:26:17,340
I come here, come here kitty. Uh,

448
00:26:17,650 --> 00:26:22,550
you hit a bell with Jenny. It
could see something coming. Jenny.

449
00:26:22,570 --> 00:26:25,300
Like he was like,
Richard is always very neat.

450
00:26:25,630 --> 00:26:29,680
It was all disheveled last time I saw him
and Eleanor is such, you saw him at a,

451
00:26:29,690 --> 00:26:33,730
uh, like a supermarket. He
was knocking over things in
the shelves. It was like, oh.

452
00:26:33,731 --> 00:26:37,050
So the drugs were fucking him up.
What drugs was young?

453
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:40,090
Somebody anti psychotic drugs and he
was supposed to change the prescription

454
00:26:40,091 --> 00:26:44,070
that week. You know, I don't know which
stories are true but Robin, that the

455
00:26:44,070 --> 00:26:48,150
big difference was there was no
indication. Well apparently not.

456
00:26:48,660 --> 00:26:51,150
But Mark Gordon,
who's a,

457
00:26:51,151 --> 00:26:54,690
this God is doctor that have had on the
podcast before sent me this piece that

458
00:26:54,691 --> 00:26:55,524
he's working on,

459
00:26:55,560 --> 00:27:00,560
on the high instances of a suicide in
relationship to a operations and that

460
00:27:02,820 --> 00:27:05,460
people need to, yeah,
that's what over and said.

461
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:09,870
He was saying that they need to accept
that there's an issue going on with

462
00:27:09,871 --> 00:27:14,160
people's hormonal balances that get
thrown out of whack by a pretty severe

463
00:27:14,161 --> 00:27:15,690
operation like heart surgery.

464
00:27:16,140 --> 00:27:20,820
And he cited the instances of a
hypothyroidism that can be caused by it.

465
00:27:20,821 --> 00:27:24,240
And then the pituitary gland function,
uh,

466
00:27:24,280 --> 00:27:28,080
especially being under for a long
time when they do like those, uh,

467
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:30,120
like what Joan Rivers just had done,

468
00:27:30,121 --> 00:27:33,480
they put her under for a long time and
now she's still in like critical care.

469
00:27:33,750 --> 00:27:37,860
She's gonna me. Yeah. Yeah. She's
fucked apparently. When you, um,

470
00:27:38,310 --> 00:27:41,270
when you, uh, get put under
for like long periods of time,

471
00:27:41,290 --> 00:27:43,680
they do something like open heart surgery,
which they did with Robin.

472
00:27:43,950 --> 00:27:46,620
It can be really tricky,
like when you come out of it,

473
00:27:46,650 --> 00:27:51,180
like it's like some pretty severe
depression occurs in a lot of people.

474
00:27:51,181 --> 00:27:55,920
So if he didn't, if people didn't see
it coming before you got that factor,

475
00:27:56,340 --> 00:27:58,690
you also have the drug factor that he,

476
00:27:58,691 --> 00:28:02,970
he recently checked himself back into
Rehab again. He said it was no reason to,

477
00:28:02,971 --> 00:28:05,820
it was just like reaffirming
his commitment to sobriety.

478
00:28:05,821 --> 00:28:10,410
But that sounds like some PR, right.
People's idea of what to say for me. Yeah.

479
00:28:10,411 --> 00:28:12,930
Don't tell him, don't tell him you
really fucked up again. Yeah. I mean,

480
00:28:12,931 --> 00:28:16,140
he didn't get, he didn't get caught
drunk driving or anything like that.

481
00:28:16,590 --> 00:28:18,810
Whatever it is,
he decided to check himself and again,

482
00:28:18,811 --> 00:28:21,840
and so there's all those things.
And you know,

483
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:25,980
he also had a lot of debt, you
know, you know what? A lot of money,

484
00:28:26,790 --> 00:28:28,440
but he was very wealthy still.

485
00:28:28,620 --> 00:28:31,980
I talked to his agent who's a
friend of mine and she was saying,

486
00:28:31,981 --> 00:28:36,720
don't let all these people tell you that
he, um, he owed more money than he had.

487
00:28:36,721 --> 00:28:38,070
He had plenty of money.

488
00:28:38,071 --> 00:28:41,790
He just has this like $30
million house in Napa.

489
00:28:41,940 --> 00:28:44,850
He say she say like a 600 acre estate,

490
00:28:45,180 --> 00:28:49,620
like has some crazy fucking park
essentially in Napa and it's, you know,

491
00:28:49,650 --> 00:28:53,760
$30 million. So, but she said he's
still, he was still rich when he died.

492
00:28:53,790 --> 00:28:57,660
Then you can't say it was that. It was,
um, you know, when someone owes money,

493
00:28:57,661 --> 00:29:01,200
like they have a mortgage, it's not you,
it's not like you can't pay that money.

494
00:29:01,320 --> 00:29:03,150
It's just more strategic.

495
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:06,780
Like as far as like how much
interest you can earn on your money.

496
00:29:06,810 --> 00:29:11,810
It's smarter in a lot of cases to like
keep paying it off like as a mortgage

497
00:29:12,151 --> 00:29:14,790
than it is just spend the, you
know, whatever he owed on it.

498
00:29:14,791 --> 00:29:16,320
Like it was 20 million bucks
or something like that.

499
00:29:16,321 --> 00:29:18,690
Take the $20 million out of his money.
But she's like,

500
00:29:18,691 --> 00:29:19,920
he could have done that if you want it to.

501
00:29:20,220 --> 00:29:21,930
So it wasn't like he was in broke at all,

502
00:29:22,830 --> 00:29:25,920
but a lot of people thought
that had that had an issue too.

503
00:29:25,950 --> 00:29:29,670
Just the fact that he's the failed
relationships is depressing. And you know,

504
00:29:29,770 --> 00:29:31,380
I know his first wife very well,

505
00:29:31,590 --> 00:29:35,190
but you know the thing about him
when he won the Academy Award,

506
00:29:35,250 --> 00:29:38,940
I'll never forget it because it was
liquid Jamie Foxx when I go, wow,

507
00:29:39,300 --> 00:29:42,130
we beat the grownups. You
know what I mean? It's like

508
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:43,840
because like they would have ever takes,

509
00:29:43,850 --> 00:29:48,760
I mean they were both series parts but
nobody ever takes comedian seriously for

510
00:29:48,761 --> 00:29:51,640
Academy Awards and Mike
Meyers in Austin Powers.

511
00:29:51,641 --> 00:29:54,040
To me it was Academy
Award winning performance.

512
00:29:54,280 --> 00:29:58,120
I really believe that at that level
because it was funny to me is anything,

513
00:29:58,300 --> 00:29:58,751
but anyway,

514
00:29:58,751 --> 00:30:03,751
Robin was so fucking talented I think
about that was a very talented actor man.

515
00:30:04,150 --> 00:30:06,140
That movie a one hour
photo and you ever see that

516
00:30:07,710 --> 00:30:11,240
creepy fucking movie man? People
saw that one. Yeah it was a no,

517
00:30:11,530 --> 00:30:12,640
it was more of an independent.

518
00:30:12,820 --> 00:30:15,370
That was one of the things that he was
talking about why he wound up doing that

519
00:30:15,371 --> 00:30:16,330
television show.

520
00:30:16,560 --> 00:30:21,560
It was because it was an independent film
situation where he was like constantly

521
00:30:22,271 --> 00:30:26,560
getting these offers to do these films
and they barely even had funding and if

522
00:30:26,561 --> 00:30:29,830
they pay they paid scale and they were
interested was interesting jobs but he

523
00:30:29,831 --> 00:30:33,520
was like the, the big movies had kind
of dried up for him for whatever reason.

524
00:30:33,560 --> 00:30:34,510
Like sometimes guys will,

525
00:30:34,630 --> 00:30:36,990
those movie star guys will
go on these peaks and vowels.

526
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:40,300
Definitely like Kevin Costner and
he started doing movies recently,

527
00:30:40,301 --> 00:30:42,040
but I remember after waterworld,

528
00:30:42,100 --> 00:30:45,610
it's like a long fucking time before
anybody put that guy on a big movie again.

529
00:30:45,790 --> 00:30:48,460
Did you actually see Robin's new show?
Uh,

530
00:30:48,461 --> 00:30:53,020
unfortunately I watched a few
episodes of it and I understand why.

531
00:30:53,021 --> 00:30:57,070
I think it didn't work. It just
seemed very, very cheesy and I'm,

532
00:30:57,071 --> 00:31:01,390
maybe that might've been one of Robin's
things that because he was still playing

533
00:31:01,391 --> 00:31:05,110
a character that never really
progressed in a way like,

534
00:31:05,340 --> 00:31:07,890
Yep.
So catch up on Seinfeld and there was a,

535
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:10,560
what do you mean by a character
that never really progressed?

536
00:31:10,670 --> 00:31:15,080
Because [inaudible] if you ever see Robin
Williams like on the tonight show or

537
00:31:15,081 --> 00:31:19,760
any of those shows, he, he always does the
same act where it's very frenetic. Yeah.

538
00:31:19,790 --> 00:31:21,200
Very crazy and very like,

539
00:31:21,201 --> 00:31:25,220
you almost can guess what he's
about to do next, you know?

540
00:31:25,221 --> 00:31:27,710
And to me it was,
I loved it,

541
00:31:27,711 --> 00:31:31,390
but I also thought that when it was
converted into a show was pretty flexible

542
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:34,130
too much. It was just like, all
right, this is so unrealistic.

543
00:31:34,660 --> 00:31:37,550
Do that when he was on more commending.
Right? Yeah, that's what I'm saying now.

544
00:31:37,551 --> 00:31:40,100
It's kind of like, well, the
difference is he's 60 now.

545
00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:41,510
Yeah.
That was 30 years ago.

546
00:31:41,550 --> 00:31:44,570
Can't be a 30 you could be a 30
year old guy and be like, oh fuck,

547
00:31:44,571 --> 00:31:46,730
I'm craze craze are [inaudible]
I'm from another planet.

548
00:31:47,630 --> 00:31:49,520
But when you're 60 you know,

549
00:31:49,850 --> 00:31:54,740
it's kind of like Jim Carrey doesn't
do Jim Carrey in as much anymore.

550
00:31:54,780 --> 00:31:58,640
Like Ace Ventura. Yeah. Like if he was
still doing ace Ventura, then you know,

551
00:31:58,641 --> 00:32:01,620
then you made it a sick home with a
laugh track. It's like, oh, the loop

552
00:32:03,110 --> 00:32:06,900
man on the moon when he did a, is that,
what is it called? The uh, yeah, yeah,

553
00:32:07,340 --> 00:32:11,240
we did the Andy Kaufman. Yeah.
Like that was a great performance.

554
00:32:11,241 --> 00:32:12,830
That was an Oscar worthy performance.
I mean,

555
00:32:12,831 --> 00:32:16,100
he really nailed Andy
Kaufman and was really,

556
00:32:16,101 --> 00:32:19,310
he really was Andy Kaufman's Rosie.
He did a great job.

557
00:32:19,880 --> 00:32:22,010
But like when he does
the ace Ventura stuff,

558
00:32:22,130 --> 00:32:24,770
you can't really do that when you're
50 years old or whatever it is.

559
00:32:24,771 --> 00:32:27,050
It's probably like 50 right,
right. You can't really do that.

560
00:32:27,410 --> 00:32:32,210
Nobody wants to see you get out
of breath. Prat falls. Well,

561
00:32:32,211 --> 00:32:35,570
didn't Chevy chase like fuck
himself up from pratfalls?

562
00:32:37,100 --> 00:32:40,610
Gerald Ford,
he used to Ford falling all the time.

563
00:32:41,210 --> 00:32:44,210
He was the president at the time because
it's got in Chevy chase was only on for

564
00:32:44,211 --> 00:32:48,250
I think one year. Really. Then Benny
and it became that famous over that,

565
00:32:48,280 --> 00:32:52,640
that one year where he was the first star.
Yeah. From Saturday night live. Right?

566
00:32:53,720 --> 00:32:55,370
Yeah.
Huh.

567
00:32:55,580 --> 00:33:00,020
But apparently all those pratfalls
we're really a, well, I've heard that.

568
00:33:00,170 --> 00:33:03,290
I heard that about the three stooges to
those guys were like punchy towards the

569
00:33:03,291 --> 00:33:06,080
end of their career because they would
smacking each other so much, you know, uh,

570
00:33:06,140 --> 00:33:10,600
getting hit with shit. What's it?
What's it guys? They'd from Jackass.

571
00:33:10,710 --> 00:33:15,410
A steevo. No, and that's
the way Johnny, I saw him,

572
00:33:15,470 --> 00:33:18,470
I seen him at the gym sometime. Right. We
were talking, I said, it's really cool.

573
00:33:18,471 --> 00:33:18,711
You know,

574
00:33:18,711 --> 00:33:22,850
you guys are trained and stuntmen stuff
because we don't know a fucking thing.

575
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:27,500
This is where just a bunch of assholes.
I started that. I didn't know that.

576
00:33:27,501 --> 00:33:30,620
I thought they knew what they were
doing. Their fucking crazy. Yeah.

577
00:33:30,621 --> 00:33:33,620
That's not a smart thing to do what
they're doing and alligator's biting your

578
00:33:33,621 --> 00:33:36,380
balls. No, they got lucky.

579
00:33:36,620 --> 00:33:40,670
They got lucky that no one ever died
doing that show and then one guy died.

580
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:43,610
They're getting lucky still.
They're doing it still.

581
00:33:44,100 --> 00:33:46,240
Like they're still filming
stuff together and doing like,

582
00:33:46,250 --> 00:33:48,500
I hate think they might even
be doing another jackass.

583
00:33:48,830 --> 00:33:52,040
What happened with Steven when he
painted that sign near seaworld?

584
00:33:52,220 --> 00:33:57,140
Seaworld socks. He climbed
up, fell a bunch of times.
She want to watch it online.

585
00:33:57,141 --> 00:34:01,070
I mean, I don't know if he
fell on purpose. He's just
just being a silly goose.

586
00:34:01,280 --> 00:34:03,260
The way climbs assign climbs a sign,

587
00:34:03,261 --> 00:34:07,430
it falls from like fucking 30 feet up and
lands on the ground and socio survives

588
00:34:07,490 --> 00:34:12,050
to visit and to see him do
stand up. No, it's bizarre.

589
00:34:12,390 --> 00:34:15,580
Yeah. Well he does like
tell stories, right? Yeah.

590
00:34:15,581 --> 00:34:18,970
But he also like did some physical stuff.
He tries to fall and stuff.

591
00:34:18,980 --> 00:34:20,140
That's what I saw with the live factory.

592
00:34:20,150 --> 00:34:21,560
I don't know if that's
part of his real act,

593
00:34:21,590 --> 00:34:25,320
but some of it involves fire depending
on the comedy club, you know,

594
00:34:25,321 --> 00:34:29,600
and in the fire fight, fire licenses.
He does a lot of different acts.

595
00:34:29,630 --> 00:34:33,980
Like he grew up, I've Ringling brothers
Barney, he graduated from their college,

596
00:34:33,981 --> 00:34:37,410
so he used to be in the circus. A lot
of his shit's like, so he was Lisa.

597
00:34:37,640 --> 00:34:40,130
You imagine if you have
a fucking business.

598
00:34:40,160 --> 00:34:43,450
It worked real hard to put together
a comedy club. You hire waitstaff,

599
00:34:43,460 --> 00:34:45,680
you get everything. We're up and
running and steevo comes to town.

600
00:34:45,681 --> 00:34:50,681
He asked you if he could do fire on
stage and you see your life falling apart

601
00:34:51,291 --> 00:34:56,150
for one fucking Thursday, November
and you're like, no, no fire dude,

602
00:34:56,360 --> 00:34:59,780
no fire. And then he's got the fire.
Anyway, like I wrote it, I wrote it.

603
00:34:59,810 --> 00:35:03,230
I mean cause a fire big.
Yeah.

604
00:35:03,231 --> 00:35:05,180
One day that's not going to work.

605
00:35:05,210 --> 00:35:09,480
One day something's going to go bad doing
fucking getting hit by bowls and get

606
00:35:09,500 --> 00:35:12,140
launched into the air with a blindfold on.
You see that?

607
00:35:12,170 --> 00:35:14,630
This was after Johnny
Knoxville was a movie star.

608
00:35:14,900 --> 00:35:17,060
He was already in movies with the Rock.

609
00:35:17,130 --> 00:35:20,420
Remember he did that movie with the
rock after that puts a blindfold on and

610
00:35:20,421 --> 00:35:24,710
let's, I'll fucking bull launch
him into the air. Unbelievable.

611
00:35:24,860 --> 00:35:26,690
And flips like head over heels,

612
00:35:26,691 --> 00:35:30,290
like can easily land on his neck and
these guys expend so much energy.

613
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:34,910
There are very mild. I you talk to them,
it very low key. Jim Carrey's like that.

614
00:35:35,380 --> 00:35:36,350
Jim Carrey, he's like, you know,

615
00:35:36,830 --> 00:35:41,360
he's the wacky guy and then these are
you ever talked to him is he's so like

616
00:35:41,490 --> 00:35:43,500
mellow and down there
it's like Steve Martin,

617
00:35:43,501 --> 00:35:46,470
he's almost shy and doesn't really like
to even talk to people. Right. He was,

618
00:35:46,500 --> 00:35:51,090
yeah, he was such a Dick to me. Uh, I was
doing see was. Yeah. He's like, I mean,

619
00:35:51,630 --> 00:35:52,081
you know,

620
00:35:52,081 --> 00:35:56,100
I was doing this thing for comedy central
where I'll be for the awards shows.

621
00:35:56,240 --> 00:36:00,150
We would interview people and everybody
was nice. Jerry Lewis, Garry Shandling,

622
00:36:00,151 --> 00:36:04,020
all these guys, Steve Martin just,
we asked him if we could interview.

623
00:36:04,021 --> 00:36:07,320
He said yeah, and then he wouldn't,
he wouldn't give me one word answers.

624
00:36:07,321 --> 00:36:08,280
And your surreal smug.

625
00:36:08,281 --> 00:36:11,950
I'm picking your fucking
career was predicated by
putting an Arrow three ahead.

626
00:36:12,030 --> 00:36:14,890
Don't don't act so slick with me.
Why is he acting slick with

627
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:20,220
clumpy? Don't do the interview if
you're going to be like that. Yeah,

628
00:36:20,221 --> 00:36:25,200
that's too bad. That's too bad. I, I think
he was brilliant. Oh, I knew as a comic.

629
00:36:25,380 --> 00:36:29,340
I mean the, the, let's get some all, all
that stuff. Alright, brilliant. Yeah.

630
00:36:29,670 --> 00:36:34,110
I think what happened to him, no, is
overload. Like if you talk to him,

631
00:36:34,170 --> 00:36:36,150
like have you listened to
him rather talk about it.

632
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:39,720
He talks about how it got to a point
where he can go on stage and anything.

633
00:36:39,721 --> 00:36:42,420
He did. People laugh so he couldn't
figure out what was funny anymore.

634
00:36:42,660 --> 00:36:44,970
They were just so happy to see him
and he was like, this is crazy.

635
00:36:45,210 --> 00:36:48,870
So he just pulled out, pulled
out a comedy. Stop doing standup.

636
00:36:48,990 --> 00:36:52,230
That word crazy. If you couldn't do
that because, yeah, I don't know.

637
00:36:52,260 --> 00:36:55,290
I mean I guess I could really, I wouldn't
have watched it up. Don't stand up.

638
00:36:55,470 --> 00:37:00,030
I could, I wouldn't want to, but I
could. Yeah, I could. You know what, I,

639
00:37:00,031 --> 00:37:03,390
there's a lot of things I want to do,
man. I like doing stuff, you know,

640
00:37:03,391 --> 00:37:05,910
like I'm writing a lot now.
Um,

641
00:37:05,940 --> 00:37:09,060
especially in writing law stand up because
I'm getting ready to do like a whole

642
00:37:09,061 --> 00:37:12,060
new hour. I've got to put together a
whole new hour. So it's really exciting.

643
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:16,710
But I'm also, I just started writing a
book to writing a script. I wrote this,

644
00:37:16,740 --> 00:37:21,480
not a script, a another book. I'll like a
horror book. Um, I'm a monster movie book,

645
00:37:22,110 --> 00:37:24,240
so I'm like,
I know a bunch of shit I like to do.

646
00:37:24,270 --> 00:37:27,370
So if someone said you can't do
standup anymore, I be like, man,

647
00:37:27,380 --> 00:37:30,650
when miss stand up, but I got to do all
this other shit. Like I don't have the,

648
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:35,490
I don't have that distraction.
I'm like busy. So for me,

649
00:37:35,491 --> 00:37:40,080
if I do only one thing, it doesn't,
it doesn't sit well for me.

650
00:37:40,110 --> 00:37:43,660
Well you have a career nobody
else has. I mean with the, the,

651
00:37:43,750 --> 00:37:47,760
the fights and everything, it just, the
way your career, where you're acting,

652
00:37:48,030 --> 00:37:50,190
you know, I mean there are
people that watch fear factor.

653
00:37:50,190 --> 00:37:52,420
They didn't know you were stand up.
Yeah,

654
00:37:52,540 --> 00:37:55,140
I did a lot of things that
didn't make any sense. You know,

655
00:37:55,141 --> 00:37:58,110
they don't go together like being
a standup and be in a cage fighting

656
00:37:58,111 --> 00:38:00,030
commentator.
They don't really go together.

657
00:38:00,031 --> 00:38:03,090
That could it fucking great at that man.
It's fun,

658
00:38:03,570 --> 00:38:07,740
but you love it and you know about it and
you break it down for people, you know.

659
00:38:07,741 --> 00:38:09,600
I mean,
I know you don't watch football,

660
00:38:09,601 --> 00:38:12,990
but I watch a lot of football
and this Guy John Gruden,

661
00:38:14,040 --> 00:38:17,240
do you watch football? He's don't
want, he's talks about bubbles,

662
00:38:17,241 --> 00:38:19,520
screens and all this shit. I Dunno.
What the fuck are you still going about?

663
00:38:19,530 --> 00:38:23,220
You can break it down so that a common
person could understand what's going on.

664
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:26,280
Well, this is a thing that sports casters
would like to do to let you know that

665
00:38:26,281 --> 00:38:30,540
they're in the know. They
use obscure lingo and jargon
and they do it on purpose.

666
00:38:30,820 --> 00:38:33,150
Like I've heard guys do it
with MMA. They were like, yeah,

667
00:38:33,151 --> 00:38:36,190
he's going to hit him with the two,
three, five Combo. Fuck is that,

668
00:38:36,250 --> 00:38:38,920
I don't even know what that is.
Everybody's is different. By the way,

669
00:38:39,190 --> 00:38:43,660
you can't say that because here's your
standard two three to a two is a right

670
00:38:43,661 --> 00:38:48,100
hand. Uh, three's a hook. So it's jab is a
one, two is a right hand. Three's a hook.

671
00:38:48,101 --> 00:38:50,680
But different camps do different shit.

672
00:38:50,860 --> 00:38:54,040
Like some camps have the
like hit him with the Aldo.

673
00:38:54,250 --> 00:38:57,610
They'll come up with names
for combinations that come
up with names for certain

674
00:38:57,611 --> 00:39:01,660
techniques. Like a shovel hook is the
razor Ruddock, the Razor Ruddock you know,

675
00:39:01,661 --> 00:39:04,390
and they'll, they'll have different
numbers. Like instead of one, two, three,

676
00:39:04,600 --> 00:39:06,040
they'll do it backwards.
You know,

677
00:39:06,041 --> 00:39:11,041
they'll have like a 10 strike combination
from like 10 being the head kick,

678
00:39:11,290 --> 00:39:15,190
nine being the need of the body's seven
being the elbow to the head, you know,

679
00:39:15,191 --> 00:39:16,900
they'll have like a bunch of them.
So they'll,

680
00:39:16,930 --> 00:39:20,400
they'll have their own system so that
no one knows what the fuck. Like if you,

681
00:39:20,420 --> 00:39:23,490
you're in someone's corner, uh,
and you're yelling at him with a,

682
00:39:23,491 --> 00:39:25,600
to hit him in the, to, the guy's
going to look out for the right hand.

683
00:39:25,780 --> 00:39:30,040
But if two is a roundhouse kick instead,
or we'll kick or something else,

684
00:39:30,280 --> 00:39:33,400
you know, no one, they won't know.
So like everybody mixes things up.

685
00:39:33,401 --> 00:39:34,450
So when someone's like,
you know,

686
00:39:34,451 --> 00:39:37,750
I think the two three is going to be big
for him in this fight. Like fuck you,

687
00:39:38,230 --> 00:39:40,660
what are you doing? You're just
letting everybody know you're inside.

688
00:39:40,690 --> 00:39:42,130
That's all you're doing.
You're just, you're,

689
00:39:42,131 --> 00:39:45,490
you're giving them nonsense sports guy
talk and you can't do that with fighting.

690
00:39:45,930 --> 00:39:50,140
You know, there's a lot of sports guy
talk, they like to insult like athletes.

691
00:39:50,740 --> 00:39:53,770
I'd like to insult players, you know,
there's like a certain amount of that,

692
00:39:54,040 --> 00:39:56,290
but they don't tolerate, people
don't tolerate that. And MMA,

693
00:39:56,500 --> 00:39:58,060
it's a totally different kind of sport.

694
00:39:58,180 --> 00:40:01,300
The people that have been like
really insulting about athletes,

695
00:40:01,420 --> 00:40:05,620
really insulting about like you like
calling them losers or fat or whatever.

696
00:40:05,740 --> 00:40:07,270
Those people all get ostracized.

697
00:40:07,420 --> 00:40:10,360
They all get pushed out because
there's such a tremendous,

698
00:40:10,990 --> 00:40:14,890
like the emotional burden of fighting.
It's respected.

699
00:40:14,891 --> 00:40:19,000
More the like there's going to be
people that mock people when they lose,

700
00:40:19,150 --> 00:40:21,670
but a lot of those people were
fucking teenagers. A little kids.

701
00:40:21,671 --> 00:40:25,900
People don't know about life. But as
far as like journalists, the Ma, the v,

702
00:40:25,960 --> 00:40:29,410
the vast majority of ones it
like super negative journalists.

703
00:40:29,411 --> 00:40:33,430
They get ostracized, which I think
is a good thing. I'll tell you what,

704
00:40:33,431 --> 00:40:37,420
the time that you invited us in Montreal,
so that was the French Canadian guy,

705
00:40:37,450 --> 00:40:38,290
George Saint Pierre.

706
00:40:38,470 --> 00:40:41,920
That was one of the most exciting
moments I've ever felt in my life.

707
00:40:42,190 --> 00:40:46,300
But a positive energy. Yeah, it's
fucking incredible. That was wild. Yeah,

708
00:40:46,490 --> 00:40:50,650
there are always wild and thank God he
won. Yeah. Can't imagine if he had lost,

709
00:40:50,680 --> 00:40:52,990
but then plus the crowd
was so much class here,

710
00:40:52,991 --> 00:40:57,310
cause I've gone to like
professional wrestling years
ago and they will look like

711
00:40:57,311 --> 00:41:01,360
the we'll cross side and they'll look,
I skate on his face.

712
00:41:01,361 --> 00:41:03,600
Don't say that to Tony Hinchcliffe.
We'll get fucking angry.

713
00:41:03,620 --> 00:41:07,510
Really hit it with the
boy. Tony Hinchcliffe was
reading a book the other day,

714
00:41:07,630 --> 00:41:11,860
a fucking pro wrestling book
on the insides of the business.

715
00:41:11,890 --> 00:41:15,490
He subscribes to the channel and just
sits there and watches every single

716
00:41:15,500 --> 00:41:16,990
wrestlemania over.

717
00:41:17,020 --> 00:41:21,350
And he was trying to explain to me how
they write the story arcs and about,

718
00:41:21,370 --> 00:41:24,250
he was right though. The Brock
Lesnar was going to beat John Cena.

719
00:41:24,280 --> 00:41:26,420
Like you told me how it was going
to happen. It was going to happen.

720
00:41:26,590 --> 00:41:31,350
I didn't know anything. I don't know
anything man. Marcy's going lifted.

721
00:41:31,360 --> 00:41:35,630
It's a show. Well they
had to, they had to, uh,

722
00:41:36,200 --> 00:41:37,310
for a bunch of reasons.

723
00:41:37,340 --> 00:41:42,100
I think they had to for like tax
purposes like that it's entertainment,

724
00:41:42,260 --> 00:41:44,720
sports, you know, it
probably costs them money,

725
00:41:44,870 --> 00:41:48,620
but I think they had to also because
otherwise they could be accused of fixing

726
00:41:48,621 --> 00:41:49,454
contests.

727
00:41:49,670 --> 00:41:53,300
So they think they had us change it from
being a sport to being entertainment.

728
00:41:53,630 --> 00:41:56,780
People didn't give a fuck though. They
don't care. Stop the ratings at all.

729
00:41:56,781 --> 00:41:59,920
I think it's funny when the punch lands
like a foot away from the guy's face,

730
00:41:59,940 --> 00:42:02,000
guy goes flying.
Oh yeah.

731
00:42:02,180 --> 00:42:04,100
Well they beat the fuck out of
each other for real too though.

732
00:42:04,101 --> 00:42:06,470
They do hit each other. Oh,
well they're good athletes.

733
00:42:06,471 --> 00:42:09,680
I mean just flipping in the air and
landed on your butt. I had to hit Kevin.

734
00:42:09,681 --> 00:42:13,100
James would have punch on, uh,
on his show. I can't queens.

735
00:42:13,240 --> 00:42:16,820
And I was so upset because my left
hand is so much better than my right,

736
00:42:17,490 --> 00:42:22,460
but I through this kind of have a fag
punch with my right hand and he goes

737
00:42:22,461 --> 00:42:24,290
flying down.
Why did you have to throw a right?

738
00:42:24,291 --> 00:42:28,250
Because they didn't accept southpaw. Yeah,
they wouldn't, they the camera thing,

739
00:42:28,251 --> 00:42:31,610
whatever it was. Sons of bitches.
I know that's ridiculous.

740
00:42:31,611 --> 00:42:34,490
You should have your ground.
But he'd say, look, I'm a lefty.

741
00:42:34,550 --> 00:42:37,310
I wasn't in a position to
Joe who was a guest star was,

742
00:42:37,311 --> 00:42:41,570
it wasn't exactly an executive producer
director to fucking damn which it around.

743
00:42:41,960 --> 00:42:45,750
Maybe we can go back and change it. We
should go back and post film upside down.

744
00:42:45,770 --> 00:42:49,940
Brian knows Photoshop switch that around
is a clever little son of a bitches.

745
00:42:49,940 --> 00:42:52,370
So when you threw the punch,
when you threw the punch,

746
00:42:52,371 --> 00:42:56,750
how far away from him were you at that
far? And it looked like I hit him really?

747
00:42:56,780 --> 00:43:00,800
And he went down and he comes up
with all ketchup in his mouth and I

748
00:43:00,801 --> 00:43:04,700
accidentally hit a guy in a scene in a,
we're doing that hardball show.

749
00:43:05,180 --> 00:43:07,670
I threw a punch and
they threw like a beer.

750
00:43:07,671 --> 00:43:11,330
I think it was my face
or fake beer and uh,

751
00:43:11,390 --> 00:43:13,130
and I was supposed to hit him afterwards,

752
00:43:13,160 --> 00:43:15,830
but because like the
fake beer hit my face,

753
00:43:15,831 --> 00:43:20,831
I was like temporarily blinded and I
tried to like do it like in front of his

754
00:43:21,231 --> 00:43:25,640
face or to the side of his
face and I accidentally like
nick dumb. I felt so bad.

755
00:43:26,030 --> 00:43:29,930
I didn't hurt him, but it was just
like, what an idiot. And of all people,

756
00:43:30,020 --> 00:43:31,400
I used to do demonstrations,

757
00:43:31,401 --> 00:43:34,460
pulling punches people's face
and I accidentally hit this guy.

758
00:43:34,670 --> 00:43:38,120
Do you VHS copies of this show
and can I transfer the ball line?

759
00:43:38,240 --> 00:43:40,760
I probably have a couple.
There's no,

760
00:43:40,820 --> 00:43:43,400
there's the only thing I've ever
been able to find is like one or two

761
00:43:43,410 --> 00:43:44,300
screenshots.

762
00:43:44,420 --> 00:43:48,740
Sony took it to where they drop
all that nuclear waste in Nevada.

763
00:43:48,950 --> 00:43:52,130
They opened up some canisters and they
dropped all the master tapes in the

764
00:43:52,131 --> 00:43:56,630
nuclear waste so that no one would ever
see. It wasn't Sony Disney, Disney Fox.

765
00:43:56,660 --> 00:43:59,720
That was the first gig. You have
one first clearing your head. Yeah.

766
00:44:00,370 --> 00:44:04,020
If it wasn't for that I nothing else. So
like I would've never gotten news radio.

767
00:44:04,480 --> 00:44:07,760
We're never gotten any of those things
because I got news radio cause I,

768
00:44:07,810 --> 00:44:08,900
it was still out here.

769
00:44:09,410 --> 00:44:12,260
And the reason why I was out here is
for that hardball show. I've, if I,

770
00:44:12,350 --> 00:44:16,250
if it wasn't for me signing a lease
because I wasn't going to sign a lease,

771
00:44:16,251 --> 00:44:18,050
like I was just going to
rent at the Oakwood. Yeah.

772
00:44:18,180 --> 00:44:20,900
You know the oakwoods is a
thing that everybody does in la.

773
00:44:21,130 --> 00:44:25,190
We get when you're getting separated from
your wife, that's too, well, it's um,

774
00:44:25,430 --> 00:44:28,460
everybody does in la when you move to
town because they'll sell their rent.

775
00:44:28,461 --> 00:44:32,160
You a furnished place, like it already
has a TV, has cable, it has a bed

776
00:44:32,340 --> 00:44:33,890
and you can kind of,
it's almost like a,

777
00:44:33,920 --> 00:44:37,680
like you move into an apartment
that's somebody else's shit is there,

778
00:44:37,740 --> 00:44:40,500
it's not bad. Like, you know, they had
paintings on the walls and like, it,

779
00:44:40,520 --> 00:44:43,800
it feels like an apartment.
That's what I got when I first was here,

780
00:44:43,801 --> 00:44:46,410
but it was like, it was too depressing.
There's too many weird people.

781
00:44:46,830 --> 00:44:48,150
There was like a lot of weirdness.

782
00:44:48,210 --> 00:44:52,530
There's like discombobulated souls
wandering around there and I just,

783
00:44:52,710 --> 00:44:57,690
I didn't enjoy the energy. And so,
uh, like any idiot who's 25 years old,

784
00:44:57,691 --> 00:45:00,300
it's convinced as television
show's going to go, I'm like,

785
00:45:00,301 --> 00:45:05,130
this fucking show's going to go. I
got a lease on an apartment, you know,

786
00:45:05,131 --> 00:45:10,050
I rented an apartment like a fucking
moron. And, uh, I signed the lease and,

787
00:45:10,051 --> 00:45:12,780
uh, I bought a TV and set it
out. I didn't even have a couch.

788
00:45:13,050 --> 00:45:17,440
I was watching TV on the ground and um,
then the fucking chuck are canceling.

789
00:45:17,441 --> 00:45:21,390
I'm like, Shit, I'm stuck out here. I
was totally ready to go back to you.

790
00:45:21,660 --> 00:45:23,160
Can you imagine if that
would would have happened,

791
00:45:23,161 --> 00:45:27,120
what your life would be totally different.
Yeah. I would have been a dancer.

792
00:45:28,020 --> 00:45:30,360
I would have been an answer.
Natalie needs a nightie.

793
00:45:30,630 --> 00:45:31,710
I just would have concentrated on that

794
00:45:31,710 --> 00:45:32,401
stand up.
I mean,

795
00:45:32,401 --> 00:45:36,090
I've already done standup TV or are they
already done Caroline's comedy hour.

796
00:45:36,091 --> 00:45:39,780
I'd already done MTV half hour comedy
hour. I was already headlining nationally,

797
00:45:39,810 --> 00:45:41,430
so I was already making money as a comic.

798
00:45:41,790 --> 00:45:44,100
It was like just when it
was starting to work for me,

799
00:45:44,310 --> 00:45:47,370
so I probably would have just
concentrated more on stand up. But yeah,

800
00:45:47,560 --> 00:45:48,420
definitely would have been different.

801
00:45:48,421 --> 00:45:50,670
I never would have been on something
like news radio, that's for sure.

802
00:45:50,840 --> 00:45:53,570
Where you're working in Dunkin
donuts and tower seven who knows?

803
00:45:53,900 --> 00:45:57,470
I wasn't working in Dunkin donuts when
I was 19 I remember bringing you up

804
00:45:57,550 --> 00:46:02,090
Montreal when the club Soda. Yeah,
that was before I was on anything.

805
00:46:02,510 --> 00:46:06,410
That was a long time. You are a completely
different kind of comedian were,

806
00:46:06,500 --> 00:46:09,200
I mean you were, you were always good, but
you were different and you didn't have,

807
00:46:09,230 --> 00:46:14,230
you didn't invest the energy that I
remember that you could do late later on

808
00:46:14,691 --> 00:46:19,190
with the new rules. Why wasn't, I
just wasn't that good? You know,

809
00:46:19,700 --> 00:46:21,560
pretty good.
I was okay.

810
00:46:21,590 --> 00:46:26,300
I just didn't know how to be the best
version of me, you know what I mean?

811
00:46:26,550 --> 00:46:29,150
But, but he didn't have any insight
either. That was the other thing.

812
00:46:29,420 --> 00:46:33,320
I was 24 25 when we met, you
know, when we first hit Montreal,

813
00:46:33,940 --> 00:46:36,790
like was it like 92 or
something like that? I Dunno,

814
00:46:36,820 --> 00:46:41,300
I something like that somewhere
around then. But I didn't,
you know, I was an idiot

815
00:46:43,010 --> 00:46:47,240
of just me being on stage.
It's just like a ridiculous proposition.

816
00:46:47,241 --> 00:46:51,050
Like who the fuck is this guy? Why is
he allowed to talk? You know, so I,

817
00:46:51,550 --> 00:46:53,960
you know what I mean? Well, I don't, I
think it'd be in tough with yourself.

818
00:46:53,961 --> 00:46:56,360
You were, you were pretty
good. You just weren't, I mean,

819
00:46:56,361 --> 00:46:59,630
now you're just so confident. The energy's
all there, you know? It's like he,

820
00:47:01,070 --> 00:47:04,730
I mean, I don't know if people get
too comfortable, but you can see it,

821
00:47:05,480 --> 00:47:08,960
you know how you have like a minute or
like a half a minute or on stage where

822
00:47:08,961 --> 00:47:09,460
there's just,

823
00:47:09,460 --> 00:47:12,960
it's just like thinking there's something
you were comfortable with that now you,

824
00:47:13,040 --> 00:47:15,830
you weren't comfortable with that
then I met then and neither was I.

825
00:47:16,110 --> 00:47:19,700
Right. And what you mean?
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Those, yeah,

826
00:47:19,940 --> 00:47:23,870
the pauses and just being in your own
skin and the audience can sense when

827
00:47:23,871 --> 00:47:26,150
you're not comfortable.
It makes them uncomfortable.

828
00:47:26,330 --> 00:47:30,070
Then the whole thing goes
wacky. Yeah. Plus then like

829
00:47:30,400 --> 00:47:33,760
if anything went wrong, the
fucking show was over. I never,

830
00:47:33,970 --> 00:47:37,390
I never pulled myself out
of a downward spiral ever.

831
00:47:37,810 --> 00:47:40,430
Like I would do great. Great, great. Eh,

832
00:47:41,600 --> 00:47:44,560
like once it started going down,
the ship was going to hit the rocks.

833
00:47:44,561 --> 00:47:48,220
There was no getting out of that.
Save yourself. We'll see what,

834
00:47:48,221 --> 00:47:52,840
I had the Improv in those clubs in New
York. Where did you develop? Um, well,

835
00:47:52,870 --> 00:47:57,700
mostly Boston up until, I guess it
was right around the time I met you.

836
00:47:57,701 --> 00:48:00,850
I was moving to New York. It was
92 ish, somewhere around there.

837
00:48:00,851 --> 00:48:05,500
I lived in New York from 92 to 94 and in
[inaudible] 94 I was already going back

838
00:48:05,501 --> 00:48:08,290
and forth to la,
but I'm nine.

839
00:48:08,410 --> 00:48:12,970
All that like 88 to 90 ish night maybe.
I guess it was 1991.

840
00:48:13,180 --> 00:48:16,660
All that was in Boston. And it was, a lot
of, it was, uh, working all these, uh,

841
00:48:16,690 --> 00:48:19,180
outside bar gigs,
the bar gigs and clubs.

842
00:48:19,320 --> 00:48:22,900
Do you remember when it
clicked them for you? Honestly,

843
00:48:23,530 --> 00:48:27,910
as a professional, I don't
think, it wasn't until I was
like 10 years in, you know,

844
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:31,930
when I did my first, uh, comedy CD, which
is a, I'm going to be dead some day.

845
00:48:31,931 --> 00:48:36,850
I did it at the Houston livestock.
I did that 99. That was when I was,

846
00:48:36,851 --> 00:48:40,790
I felt comfortable enough with what
I had to put it on a CD. And the,

847
00:48:40,800 --> 00:48:42,130
I listened to it today,
I cringe,

848
00:48:42,550 --> 00:48:45,970
but it felt comfortable
enough after 10 years in like,

849
00:48:45,971 --> 00:48:49,660
I think I can release something, you
know? So that's uh, that was one,

850
00:48:50,020 --> 00:48:54,910
but I still am, I, I feel
I'm better now than I was two
years ago. I know I am. I'm,

851
00:48:54,950 --> 00:48:58,060
I'm working on it more.
I work at it more and more excited by it.

852
00:48:58,150 --> 00:49:00,130
I wasn't that happy with my last special,

853
00:49:00,131 --> 00:49:03,430
I was when I put it out and then when
I started going over and I was like,

854
00:49:03,640 --> 00:49:06,430
I could've done this better. I was too
with doing too many different things,

855
00:49:06,850 --> 00:49:07,211
you know?

856
00:49:07,211 --> 00:49:12,211
But this one I did stand up like every
night I did stand up like Sundays.

857
00:49:12,311 --> 00:49:15,040
I did Tuesdays,
I took Mondays off,

858
00:49:15,250 --> 00:49:19,310
but almost every week I was doing Tuesday
at the Haha Wednesday at the Improv.

859
00:49:19,330 --> 00:49:23,100
Oh fuck. Yeah. It does. It does.

860
00:49:23,230 --> 00:49:27,540
I look like I looked at my act now, the
body of my work, if I may, and I know,

861
00:49:27,640 --> 00:49:31,270
I think, who the fuck wrote this? Yeah.
Because how did they get this? But Shit,

862
00:49:31,290 --> 00:49:36,070
I couldn't let go. I had
to write. Sometimes I think
like, you know, she goes to,

863
00:49:36,071 --> 00:49:38,320
they do. They do. You're right. A
lot of go. Yeah. I write every day.

864
00:49:38,620 --> 00:49:43,270
The problem is not, it's not that
funny other than that. Um, prolific,

865
00:49:43,300 --> 00:49:44,131
well that's the difference sheet.

866
00:49:44,131 --> 00:49:47,650
The guy like you and someone who is
not disciplined. Like some people,

867
00:49:47,651 --> 00:49:51,340
they sit down and they write and it's
not good and they just go, ah, fuck it.

868
00:49:51,430 --> 00:49:54,340
And they stopped writing and they'll
take days off and they won't. Right.

869
00:49:54,670 --> 00:49:58,750
But you got to show up. If you
show up, the stuff shows up.

870
00:49:58,780 --> 00:50:02,260
It's really that simple. You know, I
had a guy on the podcast yesterday,

871
00:50:02,261 --> 00:50:03,310
his named Sam Harris.

872
00:50:03,311 --> 00:50:07,500
He's a brilliant guy and neurosurgeon
or neuroscientists rather and uh,

873
00:50:07,570 --> 00:50:11,560
knows a lot about the human mind.
And he was arguing, I'm not arguing,

874
00:50:11,561 --> 00:50:14,380
but explaining the idea
of determinism that uh,

875
00:50:14,470 --> 00:50:19,240
there is no real freewill and that
everything you do is a combination of your

876
00:50:19,241 --> 00:50:22,940
genes, your life experiences, the
environment that you're in. All these,

877
00:50:23,080 --> 00:50:27,410
it was really, really
interesting argument. Not Ours.
There's no free will. Yeah,

878
00:50:27,411 --> 00:50:28,040
he's saying there's no

879
00:50:28,040 --> 00:50:32,600
free will. Um, I see what he's
saying. I see what he's saying.

880
00:50:32,670 --> 00:50:37,310
He's saying that the reason why you act
the way you act is essentially based on

881
00:50:37,400 --> 00:50:41,990
all these factors that you have
no control over, like your genes,

882
00:50:42,170 --> 00:50:44,780
your life experiences,
all these different things.

883
00:50:45,140 --> 00:50:49,270
But as a comic, um, I dunno,

884
00:50:49,730 --> 00:50:54,730
I guess it's all those things that are
leading me to invest more energy into it

885
00:50:54,771 --> 00:50:58,090
right now, but like,
whatever it is, you know,

886
00:50:58,100 --> 00:51:02,060
I don't freewill whatever the fuck it
is that's causing me to be excited about

887
00:51:02,061 --> 00:51:06,830
it. Now I'm as excited if not more excited
by standup right now than I ever have

888
00:51:06,831 --> 00:51:08,150
been ever.
I could see that.

889
00:51:08,180 --> 00:51:11,300
I get so much more for you get on stage
and you were already like in a good mood

890
00:51:11,301 --> 00:51:15,760
because you're on stage. I think I'm
appreciating how awesome a Gig it is too.

891
00:51:16,280 --> 00:51:20,750
[inaudible] I can never lost
appreciation for it, but I, you know,

892
00:51:20,751 --> 00:51:22,820
I compare it to other things.

893
00:51:23,440 --> 00:51:26,450
Oh wait, the other thing is for
me, it's crossing generations.

894
00:51:26,451 --> 00:51:30,840
I appreciate that so much.
And uh, like, I mean,

895
00:51:30,860 --> 00:51:34,370
you're gonna quiz shows like yours
help a lot, but it's amazing to me.

896
00:51:34,371 --> 00:51:38,640
I was in Montreal, true story.
Stop me if you heard this. Oh, oh.

897
00:51:38,830 --> 00:51:42,650
I was in Montreal and this girl and her
mother said that they were related to

898
00:51:42,651 --> 00:51:47,150
come up to me and wanted to fuck.
They wanted that. It suck my fucking,

899
00:51:49,650 --> 00:51:54,260
oh, he goes, the kid was
nervous, you know, and she said,
are you dom Herrera? I go,

900
00:51:54,261 --> 00:51:57,710
yeah. And then she gets a quick
get a picture. I said, of course.

901
00:51:58,070 --> 00:52:01,510
And so the mother walks away to get a
camera and the father, I said, there were,

902
00:52:01,910 --> 00:52:06,620
how old are you? She goes, 12 I go 12
and this is because of the Internet,

903
00:52:06,650 --> 00:52:11,300
you know, I said, and you know me.
She goes, I said, on, she goes,

904
00:52:11,301 --> 00:52:14,650
listen man, she called me. Dude,
you could listen dude. I've ever,

905
00:52:14,690 --> 00:52:17,880
I've been a fan of yours since I
was seven. I said seven. I don't,

906
00:52:17,890 --> 00:52:22,100
I didn't know I had had any single
digit fans. Wow. And that incredible.

907
00:52:22,160 --> 00:52:26,930
That's wild. A 12 year old has been a
fan since they were seven. And she says,

908
00:52:27,130 --> 00:52:30,220
funny is funny. And I said,
you know, we're so different,

909
00:52:30,230 --> 00:52:33,380
which different generations, different
worlds. And she said, I said, well,

910
00:52:33,400 --> 00:52:37,430
I can't believe your parents would let
you watch a pig. Like she goes, well,

911
00:52:37,431 --> 00:52:39,750
you know the Internet.
You can watch anything dominant.

912
00:52:39,770 --> 00:52:43,430
Six years are going to be fucking her.
That's where it gets dark.

913
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:45,920
I look forward to that show.
You will too.

914
00:52:45,930 --> 00:52:49,930
I know I need two years to get hard now.
Play.

915
00:52:50,090 --> 00:52:54,290
You gave me these six years. Heads
up. Just save up the lows. Oh boy.

916
00:52:54,320 --> 00:52:57,740
Don't have any of those three
quarter erection ejaculation. No.

917
00:52:57,741 --> 00:53:01,210
That's a limp.
Dick lead.

918
00:53:01,211 --> 00:53:05,500
Jerk it off of the limp Dick and you
calm anyway and you're like, oh no.

919
00:53:05,630 --> 00:53:09,440
Why are those words the funniest words?
Limp Dick is,

920
00:53:09,860 --> 00:53:13,400
I used all over the vogue limp.
Dick is always limp. Dick is floods.

921
00:53:13,420 --> 00:53:16,310
It's embarrassing. It's
inherently, I wouldn't know.

922
00:53:16,550 --> 00:53:21,260
Never the El Pomar now. Whoa. Yeah.
Just hey, you're like Liberace.

923
00:53:22,400 --> 00:53:25,970
Liberace.
I one of his balls was a pump was or air

924
00:53:26,050 --> 00:53:29,850
Max. I'm not kidding. No, I'm not
kidding. Yeah, you gotta pump [inaudible].

925
00:53:30,090 --> 00:53:34,170
There's a thing that guys do when
they get erectile dysfunction that a,

926
00:53:34,171 --> 00:53:38,400
they used to do that. Just talking
about it. I don't know about that.

927
00:53:38,401 --> 00:53:41,980
I've heard that a stone like the lion,
the glass white girls shit on him.

928
00:53:41,981 --> 00:53:44,940
I thought that was dating a
guy at heard Danny Thomas.

929
00:53:45,280 --> 00:53:48,900
I was him to together. They jerk
each other off while they watched it,

930
00:53:48,990 --> 00:53:52,140
but that's not a really shit at the fair.
It's that shit. It's shit. No to table.

931
00:53:52,400 --> 00:53:56,230
Yeah, but the biological, you know you're
watching it expand and you watch it.

932
00:53:56,540 --> 00:53:56,740
Yeah.

933
00:53:56,740 --> 00:54:00,450
It's like when a little kid plays a plate
out and they have the factory and they

934
00:54:00,690 --> 00:54:02,790
winded up and it comes out.
That's with like,

935
00:54:03,500 --> 00:54:07,080
you were the one that told me about that
a long time ago when we first started

936
00:54:07,081 --> 00:54:07,471
looking up,

937
00:54:07,471 --> 00:54:11,520
shared on the Internet that some Japanese
guys getting shit on and what isn't.

938
00:54:11,520 --> 00:54:15,540
A lot of videos of people that would like
shit in each other's mouths and stuff

939
00:54:15,541 --> 00:54:18,450
and you can't believe it's real,
but when you watch it,

940
00:54:18,720 --> 00:54:20,370
there's some fake ones like two girls,

941
00:54:20,371 --> 00:54:23,340
one cup they like put ice cream up their
ass or whatever the fuck they put up

942
00:54:23,341 --> 00:54:24,870
there.
That wasn't exactly shit.

943
00:54:25,770 --> 00:54:29,610
Eight parents that you can get some severe
diabetes from that get all that sugar

944
00:54:29,611 --> 00:54:31,770
up your butt hole. But I don't think
they're concerned about those girls.

945
00:54:33,010 --> 00:54:36,600
The first worry, there's plenty of
videos though of people eating shit.

946
00:54:37,860 --> 00:54:42,120
It's apparently it's a genre. You
know, some folks enjoy watching it.

947
00:54:42,330 --> 00:54:47,140
I've had it in my mouth once like, oh, oh,

948
00:54:47,180 --> 00:54:51,510
because he's thinking about asking. He's
like, I shouldn't let me need let me.

949
00:54:51,780 --> 00:54:53,730
Oh No,
no need.

950
00:54:53,790 --> 00:54:58,140
No need to know or knew her very well.
He was sleeping in the same bed as her.

951
00:54:58,170 --> 00:55:02,460
You do a bid on that? Yeah. Okay.
And then I thought I heard it before.

952
00:55:02,670 --> 00:55:06,710
It's a true story.
True story with my happy stories.

953
00:55:07,110 --> 00:55:12,090
The truth
gets dark out there.

954
00:55:13,580 --> 00:55:15,540
That's interesting that
that's a weird fetish.

955
00:55:15,640 --> 00:55:19,310
That wasn't his idea that just an
accident. She was an accident. Right.

956
00:55:19,350 --> 00:55:22,560
Some people through shit and he
chose his mouth like, go, okay,

957
00:55:22,830 --> 00:55:26,040
let's meet here at two o'clock
and I'm a shit in your mouth. Yes.

958
00:55:26,260 --> 00:55:31,140
Get to that point. How do you do on
every pair of perversion there is.

959
00:55:31,141 --> 00:55:32,490
So you get to that point.
Well,

960
00:55:32,491 --> 00:55:36,330
that's why would Sam Harris says it's so
fascinating is if determinism is true,

961
00:55:36,331 --> 00:55:39,150
that means that you're
not even responsible for
letting someone shit in your

962
00:55:39,151 --> 00:55:39,481
mouth.

963
00:55:39,481 --> 00:55:43,410
It's like all these variables have played
a part in your being who you are at

964
00:55:43,411 --> 00:55:44,244
this moment,

965
00:55:44,400 --> 00:55:48,000
lying there on the stainless steel table
by this Japanese guy hovers over your

966
00:55:48,001 --> 00:55:52,020
face. Should have been he's guy.
Yeah, he pulls it, pulls us a sack up.

967
00:55:52,720 --> 00:55:57,060
So's balls. Don't get shit on and dumps
one. Write down your fucking mind.

968
00:56:00,870 --> 00:56:04,440
I don't know why. I don't know. I
don't know a lot of things though.

969
00:56:04,441 --> 00:56:08,490
I don't understand the grateful dead.
You know why there's such a phenomena.

970
00:56:08,550 --> 00:56:11,640
I don't get why anybody listens to
that and likes it. I don't get it.

971
00:56:11,641 --> 00:56:14,970
I understand that you like
it, but I'm just being honest.
No, I don't like not you,

972
00:56:14,971 --> 00:56:18,230
but anybody who's listening to this,
like I get like sunk trucking.

973
00:56:18,480 --> 00:56:22,350
I get a touch of gray. I've, I've, I've
heard a bunch of that are pretty good,

974
00:56:22,351 --> 00:56:25,630
but to be a dead is a little over the top.

975
00:56:25,930 --> 00:56:27,670
My cousin traveled around
the country with them.

976
00:56:28,510 --> 00:56:32,050
I used to used to travel the country. I
mean it went to three shows, but we got,

977
00:56:32,070 --> 00:56:35,740
but he died right when I got into them.
Of course it all that so funny. He's like,

978
00:56:35,741 --> 00:56:39,610
fuck this guy, I'm just going to kill
myself right there. Also about though,

979
00:56:39,840 --> 00:56:44,110
what a lot of people forget is that it
was also people that you knew that also

980
00:56:44,111 --> 00:56:47,230
like the smoke marijuana when
it was really, really illegal.

981
00:56:47,260 --> 00:56:49,780
So it was like this group thing of like,
Hey,

982
00:56:49,781 --> 00:56:54,781
we all like to do psychedelics
and mushrooms and smoke
weed and that's awesome.

983
00:56:55,820 --> 00:56:59,200
Yeah. Well there's also a thing
that happens when you're on a drug,

984
00:56:59,320 --> 00:57:02,800
when you listen to something where it
just sounds totally different than if

985
00:57:02,801 --> 00:57:04,540
you're not on that drug.
That's a,

986
00:57:04,541 --> 00:57:07,960
that's a reality that I
experienced recently with um,

987
00:57:08,380 --> 00:57:13,020
with what's called an ECO row.
An ICO is this thing that, uh,

988
00:57:13,100 --> 00:57:15,070
the play when there's,
um,

989
00:57:15,400 --> 00:57:19,150
Iowasca ceremonies are
going on and if you, uh,

990
00:57:19,210 --> 00:57:21,760
you take DMT and you
listen to this [inaudible],

991
00:57:21,761 --> 00:57:24,360
you see these things like
play out in front of you.

992
00:57:24,510 --> 00:57:25,900
Tony is going to talk about it tomorrow.

993
00:57:25,960 --> 00:57:29,260
Tony and I will talk about it tomorrow
cause we did it together in Texas,

994
00:57:29,290 --> 00:57:31,300
in Texas with these ECO rose.

995
00:57:31,600 --> 00:57:35,220
But it's this crazy
fucking sound that's um,

996
00:57:36,010 --> 00:57:37,540
that's playing that is like,
it's,

997
00:57:37,541 --> 00:57:42,340
it's really wild because the sound's
somehow or another effects the music or

998
00:57:42,341 --> 00:57:45,220
the,
the images you see rather this is it.

999
00:57:52,680 --> 00:57:57,180
This is all these shamans in the Amazon
and they play this and while you're on

1000
00:57:57,181 --> 00:57:58,380
DMT and you do this,

1001
00:57:58,680 --> 00:58:03,660
the images and these like elves in this
hallucination or whatever you want to

1002
00:58:03,661 --> 00:58:08,520
call it, they dance to this
music and it's fucking crazy,

1003
00:58:08,521 --> 00:58:10,200
man.
It makes the whole thing

1004
00:58:11,860 --> 00:58:13,650
that makes the whole
thing even more bizarre.

1005
00:58:13,830 --> 00:58:18,830
But what's weird is that these songs were
actually designed to be used that way.

1006
00:58:19,200 --> 00:58:23,460
They were all made by these trippers and
the Amazon and they're all using like

1007
00:58:23,461 --> 00:58:26,150
rattles and shit and they're
whistling like, listen to this.

1008
00:58:36,290 --> 00:58:39,290
It sounds like really simple music, right?
If you listen to that, and I'm like,

1009
00:58:39,291 --> 00:58:41,900
dude, you need to download this and be
like, bitch, get the fuck outta here.

1010
00:58:41,901 --> 00:58:45,170
I'm listening to some asshole whistle
and slap his thought. But if you,

1011
00:58:45,550 --> 00:58:49,760
if you listened to it when you're under
the influence of DMT, it's amazing.

1012
00:58:49,761 --> 00:58:52,880
It's like they danced to the music.
It's really,

1013
00:58:52,881 --> 00:58:55,820
really weird with all psychedelics though.
Music is very,

1014
00:58:55,821 --> 00:58:57,770
very important with
mushrooms and everything.

1015
00:58:57,771 --> 00:59:01,430
Cause I've really changed a whole
mission trip before just on the music I

1016
00:59:01,431 --> 00:59:06,050
listened to being like pink Floyd or
doing some kind of more like a drum type

1017
00:59:06,051 --> 00:59:09,890
stuff. Uh, I think that would
kill me. Yeah, I'm serious.

1018
00:59:09,891 --> 00:59:12,680
I think if I took mushrooms
or anything hallucinogenic,

1019
00:59:13,010 --> 00:59:17,690
I'm so close to the fucking edge anyway.
The I need like tranquilizers.

1020
00:59:18,440 --> 00:59:21,100
You're that close to the edge.
Well as far as that account

1021
00:59:22,790 --> 00:59:26,330
Aerosmith something long
when the world today,

1022
00:59:26,480 --> 00:59:29,910
I don't know what it is.
Something wrong.

1023
00:59:34,650 --> 00:59:37,950
This is one of my favorites.
I like that.

1024
00:59:39,310 --> 00:59:40,143
It's kind of like

1025
00:59:40,160 --> 00:59:43,330
the last thing you hear when walking
down a dark alley about to get raped by

1026
00:59:43,340 --> 00:59:45,680
some guy was tricking them.
But we feel

1027
00:59:47,850 --> 00:59:51,380
he didn't really even think that he just
went with that because he thought it'd

1028
00:59:51,381 --> 00:59:52,450
be an interesting thing to say.

1029
00:59:52,470 --> 00:59:55,430
The first one I did cause I was thinking
of a guy whistling and you know like

1030
00:59:55,431 --> 00:59:57,890
walking slowly down an alley,
stroking his car.

1031
01:00:01,010 --> 01:00:03,140
That'd be terrible if it guy
was raping you while doing this.

1032
01:00:04,310 --> 01:00:07,130
If you just have your mind went there
and you're getting raped by dragons and

1033
01:00:07,910 --> 01:00:08,360
patterns.

1034
01:00:08,360 --> 01:00:12,580
Have you hallucinated when right now
have you listen to it? What do you mean?

1035
01:00:12,710 --> 01:00:16,990
In real life or drugs, but
drugs. Yeah. Yeah. Hello?

1036
01:00:18,450 --> 01:00:21,340
I don't know.
I don't know if I'm really seeing Elvis.

1037
01:00:21,341 --> 01:00:25,960
Maybe I'm really seeing now is, but I'm
assuming that it's a Luiseno pot. No.

1038
01:00:25,961 --> 01:00:28,960
Well you can if you eat it,
if you eat it and you close your eyes,

1039
01:00:28,961 --> 01:00:32,080
you definitely hallucinate for sure.
If you eat a large dose,

1040
01:00:32,081 --> 01:00:33,220
like if you have like a cookie,

1041
01:00:33,221 --> 01:00:36,490
like a strong cookie and then
you lay down and close your eyes,

1042
01:00:36,491 --> 01:00:40,940
you see bizarre shit that would scare
the shit out of him. It should. It's,

1043
01:00:41,270 --> 01:00:42,130
but that's a,

1044
01:00:42,280 --> 01:00:45,190
that's a part of the whole thing is
that it scares the shit out of you.

1045
01:00:45,191 --> 01:00:49,270
And then when it's over you feel better.
I was asking Joey Diaz last night about,

1046
01:00:49,750 --> 01:00:53,020
I said, do you ever go a day without
eating pot? It goes, yeah, of course I do.

1047
01:00:53,021 --> 01:00:54,940
I said, does it bother?
He goes, no, I smoke.

1048
01:00:56,590 --> 01:01:00,970
I tried it once in the 60s.
It's overrated. Yeah. He um,

1049
01:01:01,090 --> 01:01:05,380
he's taken it to another level.
He definitely, he does take,

1050
01:01:06,270 --> 01:01:10,930
you know, he takes days off of
edibles. Animals can fuck with you man.

1051
01:01:11,740 --> 01:01:14,800
They can, they can give you panic
attacks. I've been with Joey when he was

1052
01:01:14,840 --> 01:01:19,290
getting like a panic attack.
We were on a plane really?

1053
01:01:19,520 --> 01:01:23,360
And is he in these things called Chiba
Chews and we tell you about Chiba Chews

1054
01:01:23,550 --> 01:01:27,950
my rare, right. I don't ever eat a whole
cheat, but you, I mean, ever, ever.

1055
01:01:28,380 --> 01:01:31,920
So Joey, three of them, the re,

1056
01:01:33,120 --> 01:01:37,200
oh my gosh.
Chiba Chews war.

1057
01:01:37,980 --> 01:01:42,570
If you a three Chiba Chews and you
listen to this and you close your eyes,

1058
01:01:44,520 --> 01:01:47,730
you would see the most bizarre shit ever.

1059
01:01:48,120 --> 01:01:50,940
Dancing fluorescent cartoon characters,

1060
01:01:50,941 --> 01:01:55,941
fucking and creating new
cartoon characters that
are separating and dividing

1061
01:01:57,001 --> 01:01:58,110
like cells.

1062
01:01:58,620 --> 01:02:03,300
You'd see your whole childhood
play out in a cartoon form,

1063
01:02:03,330 --> 01:02:06,720
like a comic strip. He could see
anything. You will hallucinate.

1064
01:02:07,180 --> 01:02:10,740
Like that's a massive,
massive dose of ta.

1065
01:02:11,250 --> 01:02:13,350
Now how did he walk from
the plane to the car?

1066
01:02:13,380 --> 01:02:16,410
He did and he sat in that plane for five
hours and we flew across the country

1067
01:02:16,770 --> 01:02:19,950
and Atlanta go Joe Rogan. I almost
had a fucking panic on that plane.

1068
01:02:20,790 --> 01:02:24,600
Was He okay by the time we landed,
basically, yeah, he recovers quickly.

1069
01:02:25,890 --> 01:02:27,120
Thc when you will,

1070
01:02:27,270 --> 01:02:31,920
marijuana when you eat it produces a
psychoactive chemical called 11 hydroxy

1071
01:02:31,921 --> 01:02:35,250
metabolite and it's about five
times more psychoactive than THC.

1072
01:02:35,670 --> 01:02:37,530
It's much more like mushrooms,

1073
01:02:37,740 --> 01:02:42,390
much more like I'm much
more like a psychedelic than
marijuana because marijuana

1074
01:02:42,391 --> 01:02:44,070
is, it gives you high. But um,

1075
01:02:44,160 --> 01:02:47,610
that five hydroxy will fucking
kick your dig into the dirt.

1076
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:51,060
It's one of the reasons why when people
eat cookies, they always say, oh,

1077
01:02:51,061 --> 01:02:54,030
it was laced, man, it was
laced. That wasn't lace.

1078
01:02:54,060 --> 01:02:57,450
That's what happens when you
eat a lot of it. Especially I,

1079
01:02:57,451 --> 01:02:59,880
one of the most frightening
moments in my life. I took,

1080
01:03:00,210 --> 01:03:03,900
I took a marijuana pill and I was talking
to this guy that turned out to be a

1081
01:03:03,901 --> 01:03:08,040
rapist. Turned out to eventually,
he eventually went to jail for rape.

1082
01:03:08,250 --> 01:03:12,120
He was a Brazilian Jiu
Jitsu belt and, uh, he, uh,

1083
01:03:12,240 --> 01:03:15,830
he fled while he was on
this, uh, under, you know,

1084
01:03:15,840 --> 01:03:19,860
they were looking for him cause he fled
and moved to the Pacific northwest,

1085
01:03:19,980 --> 01:03:23,640
started doing Jujitsu again even
though they were looking for him,

1086
01:03:24,240 --> 01:03:28,120
couldn't stop doing Jujitsu cause
he likes to do it so much. And uh,

1087
01:03:28,980 --> 01:03:30,240
I was at this,
uh,

1088
01:03:31,290 --> 01:03:35,760
grappling event and he had competed in
this grappling event and I had taken this

1089
01:03:35,761 --> 01:03:39,870
pill and I was way too high to be out
in public. This was, it was confusing.

1090
01:03:40,020 --> 01:03:43,530
It was like really like, whoa. It was
one of the first times I was ever really,

1091
01:03:43,531 --> 01:03:45,640
really big. But he, in this,

1092
01:03:46,110 --> 01:03:49,050
he and I were talking and when
we were talking I was like, wow,

1093
01:03:49,051 --> 01:03:53,880
there's a distinct like different
thing going on with this guy.

1094
01:03:54,110 --> 01:03:56,550
Like this guy has like, uh, there's, uh,

1095
01:03:57,150 --> 01:04:02,150
an ability to do things that this guy
has like in his head that might not

1096
01:04:02,581 --> 01:04:06,360
necessarily be good things. Like if you
were with this guy in a street fight,

1097
01:04:06,870 --> 01:04:09,420
he might like stomp somebody to death.
You know what I mean?

1098
01:04:09,600 --> 01:04:13,080
Like you might see him do that. Like
don't do it. Stop doing it. You know,

1099
01:04:13,081 --> 01:04:14,760
like he wouldn't, I don't, you know,

1100
01:04:14,790 --> 01:04:19,620
there was like an edge that he had that
he had crossed over and I was feeling

1101
01:04:19,621 --> 01:04:20,720
that when I was on,

1102
01:04:21,020 --> 01:04:26,010
on the pills and then like a couple
months later the guy goes to jail or gets

1103
01:04:26,011 --> 01:04:27,120
indicted and you know,

1104
01:04:27,121 --> 01:04:29,910
and then flees and then wants up going
to jail later when he's still doing

1105
01:04:29,911 --> 01:04:33,000
Jujitsu because they had
found him in some school.

1106
01:04:33,750 --> 01:04:37,470
Well cause he's a really high level
black belt is not that many guys that are

1107
01:04:37,590 --> 01:04:39,510
tapable of tapping out other black balls.

1108
01:04:39,750 --> 01:04:43,050
So when some guy comes in your school
out of nowhere and he started strangling

1109
01:04:43,051 --> 01:04:46,350
your instructor, everybody's like, well
what the fuck is going on? Who's this guy?

1110
01:04:47,220 --> 01:04:50,220
You've tried to pretend he was some
guy from Brazil and everybody's like,

1111
01:04:50,221 --> 01:04:54,360
but he's American. The fuck's going on.
He's in jail now. He's in jail now. Yeah,

1112
01:04:57,590 --> 01:05:02,380
but as those God damn pills, I saw him
to his soul. I didn't like it dumb.

1113
01:05:03,150 --> 01:05:04,110
I don't even like hearing it.

1114
01:05:04,790 --> 01:05:07,950
That's true because I'm
going to get it over the air,

1115
01:05:08,850 --> 01:05:13,200
but in the context of that story
is a song any better? Yeah.

1116
01:05:14,100 --> 01:05:18,040
I like this. Oh, you

1117
01:05:18,040 --> 01:05:19,270
don't like it?
Your highest fucking,

1118
01:05:19,271 --> 01:05:22,330
you hear this is the greatest song of
all time. That's why I downloaded it. I,

1119
01:05:22,340 --> 01:05:23,530
how do I keep it?

1120
01:05:23,980 --> 01:05:27,160
I wanted it to be a part of my life
where they say what language are they

1121
01:05:27,161 --> 01:05:31,660
singing? Anything or just making
noises. There's, there's a,

1122
01:05:31,661 --> 01:05:34,180
there's words to it. I don't know
what the words are to this one.

1123
01:05:34,181 --> 01:05:37,600
There's words to it. Obviously the other
ones didn't know from the Amazon. Yeah,

1124
01:05:38,020 --> 01:05:40,450
yeah. That's, that's
the real deal. Peruvian.

1125
01:05:40,451 --> 01:05:43,690
So I guess it must be a some form of a,

1126
01:05:44,920 --> 01:05:49,150
I don't know what I mean, it's not
Spanish native. Yeah, but Peru,

1127
01:05:49,151 --> 01:05:50,920
they speak Spanish mostly.

1128
01:05:51,130 --> 01:05:55,060
I think they speak a bunch of different
layers of a native tongue and the Amazon

1129
01:05:55,061 --> 01:05:58,600
and a couple of wild shit, man,
that's crazy place to live.

1130
01:05:58,810 --> 01:06:00,660
But this is their technology.
This is the,

1131
01:06:00,661 --> 01:06:03,440
the technology that
they've invented to try to

1132
01:06:05,380 --> 01:06:09,910
enhance or change these psychedelic
trips that they go on. Very, very weird.

1133
01:06:10,370 --> 01:06:14,660
You ever get stuck in one you think you
can't get out of, get out of it? No. Um,

1134
01:06:14,740 --> 01:06:15,850
I've gotten,
um,

1135
01:06:16,320 --> 01:06:20,860
but I had one that I did
a few years back that, uh,

1136
01:06:20,920 --> 01:06:23,050
fucked me up for a couple
of weeks afterwards.

1137
01:06:23,740 --> 01:06:27,130
It was so intense that for a couple of
weeks afterwards I was really worried

1138
01:06:27,131 --> 01:06:30,900
that like reality itself had gone.
The way I described it was, it was,

1139
01:06:30,901 --> 01:06:35,200
it reality was too slippery. Like it
didn't, the, it didn't make sense.

1140
01:06:35,201 --> 01:06:37,870
Like I get these thoughts in my head,
like I'd be driving on the highway.

1141
01:06:37,871 --> 01:06:41,560
I'm like, what if a car flips the
divide and comes towards me right now?

1142
01:06:41,860 --> 01:06:43,600
Like I'm like, what am I
thinking this, you know?

1143
01:06:43,810 --> 01:06:48,070
And I think where were you working on
then knowing this or fear factor? No,

1144
01:06:48,090 --> 01:06:51,910
it was post fear factor. Um, so
nothing just doing stand up. Oh, okay.

1145
01:06:52,010 --> 01:06:55,360
Oh you're still at the comedy store
because I remember you talking to me about

1146
01:06:55,361 --> 01:06:56,540
this and wasn't,

1147
01:06:57,010 --> 01:07:02,010
so that was 2007 maybe 2006
maybe wasn't that long ago?

1148
01:07:03,340 --> 01:07:04,173
Yeah.

1149
01:07:04,920 --> 01:07:07,590
Yeah. Cause we stopped going
to the comedy store at 2007.

1150
01:07:08,700 --> 01:07:11,770
I feel like it was post that
Brian, that's so long ago. Yeah,

1151
01:07:11,850 --> 01:07:14,130
I think that bet on the wrong horse.
It doesn't make any sense.

1152
01:07:14,160 --> 01:07:18,420
I remember we were in the
back alley behind where I
had a few that fucked me up.

1153
01:07:18,421 --> 01:07:21,390
I don't know if this is the same.
Big Life is slippery and you were like,

1154
01:07:21,391 --> 01:07:24,090
you just saw a ghost and I'm like did you
do this last night? And you're like, no,

1155
01:07:24,091 --> 01:07:25,820
this is like four days
ago. And I'm like, what?

1156
01:07:26,940 --> 01:07:30,930
I'm not sure if our timelines are correct
here. Anyway. That's not important.

1157
01:07:31,020 --> 01:07:32,730
The important thing was it took about,

1158
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:38,000
I think what was going on for about two
weeks after this experience was that it

1159
01:07:38,911 --> 01:07:42,540
was so ego shattering but the, the, the,

1160
01:07:42,541 --> 01:07:47,541
the psychedelic trip was so it's so like
changed my idea of what was important

1161
01:07:48,180 --> 01:07:51,630
and my position like in my own universe,

1162
01:07:51,631 --> 01:07:54,030
like instead of me being the
center of my own universe,

1163
01:07:54,300 --> 01:07:59,250
I became like just this piece
in this gigantic fractal.

1164
01:07:59,580 --> 01:08:03,030
Like it was, it was very weird.
And it, if you're, you know,

1165
01:08:03,031 --> 01:08:06,750
you're clinging to this idea,
like what makes you successful,

1166
01:08:06,780 --> 01:08:11,220
what makes you push forward? Well, I know
you personally, I know you enjoy killing.

1167
01:08:11,221 --> 01:08:15,950
You like going up there and, and, and
you like being a great comic. You know,

1168
01:08:15,951 --> 01:08:16,100
there's

1169
01:08:16,100 --> 01:08:19,880
a reason why you're a great comic. You've
worked at it, you like it, you enjoy it,

1170
01:08:19,881 --> 01:08:23,390
you go up, you do it and you
take pride in that. Well,

1171
01:08:23,391 --> 01:08:26,060
when you have like a really
intense psychedelic experience,

1172
01:08:26,061 --> 01:08:29,450
one of the weird things that happens
is like your idea of who you are,

1173
01:08:29,480 --> 01:08:31,340
like the youth thing that you part of it,

1174
01:08:31,341 --> 01:08:34,580
which was so natural and
normal kind of like dissolves.

1175
01:08:34,850 --> 01:08:39,850
So I think my ego by worrying
about all this shit by like,

1176
01:08:40,530 --> 01:08:43,400
like worrying about cars flipping into
my lane or weird things happening.

1177
01:08:43,630 --> 01:08:47,300
It was almost like my ego was trying
to present me with a bunch of different

1178
01:08:47,301 --> 01:08:51,740
dangers. And though these dangers,
you have to prepare for these,

1179
01:08:51,770 --> 01:08:54,290
so you have to worry about yourself.
You have to think about yourself.

1180
01:08:54,440 --> 01:08:58,340
So it's like, it was trying to
counterbalance the destructive ego,

1181
01:08:58,341 --> 01:09:01,460
destructive properties of the psychedelic.
Like the psychedelic was saying,

1182
01:09:01,461 --> 01:09:05,600
listen, you can tweak out all you want
about shit. But here's the reality.

1183
01:09:05,601 --> 01:09:09,110
The reality is you're a part of something
that's infinite and it goes on forever.

1184
01:09:09,440 --> 01:09:13,490
It's infinite in size and it's
infinite in length and it's fractal.

1185
01:09:13,520 --> 01:09:17,240
It folds into itself and expands
on to infinity. And you can,

1186
01:09:17,241 --> 01:09:20,240
you could pretend you're important
all day long, but you're not there.

1187
01:09:20,241 --> 01:09:21,290
It's impossible for you.

1188
01:09:21,291 --> 01:09:26,291
You're a part of the universal soup of
not just consciousness but of atoms and

1189
01:09:26,571 --> 01:09:29,510
subatomic particles and all these
different things fold into each other.

1190
01:09:29,900 --> 01:09:31,100
And it was so,
uh,

1191
01:09:31,550 --> 01:09:35,870
it was so humbling that I think
my ego was trying to battle it.

1192
01:09:36,110 --> 01:09:39,020
I think my ego was trying to reclaim
ground and the way to do that was to make

1193
01:09:39,021 --> 01:09:41,870
me paranoid, to make me
worry about shit. You know,

1194
01:09:41,880 --> 01:09:44,060
I usually I'm aware when I drive,

1195
01:09:44,061 --> 01:09:46,700
but I don't usually think like
what if a car flips over that lane?

1196
01:09:46,700 --> 01:09:48,510
What if a car comes in?
You know,

1197
01:09:49,220 --> 01:09:52,710
one of the things that they used to
connect a DMT with when it first, uh,

1198
01:09:53,030 --> 01:09:54,290
when their first experiment with it,

1199
01:09:54,680 --> 01:09:59,030
they thought it was a causes psychosis
and they thought maybe it exists in

1200
01:09:59,031 --> 01:10:02,960
higher doses and in people that are,
um,

1201
01:10:03,440 --> 01:10:07,340
and people that are psychotic. That's
one of the reasons why they're nutty.

1202
01:10:07,400 --> 01:10:09,800
They're nutty because their
brain is producing all this,

1203
01:10:09,830 --> 01:10:14,600
these weird chemicals that have been
shown to be produced by the body that also

1204
01:10:14,601 --> 01:10:16,940
produce hallucinations.
And my B.

1205
01:10:16,950 --> 01:10:20,140
It's just see that there was a Twitter
images about that guy who was pineal.

1206
01:10:20,141 --> 01:10:20,974
Yeah.

1207
01:10:21,240 --> 01:10:24,550
Oh yeah, we showed it on the last
episode. We did good. Joe, you when your,

1208
01:10:24,551 --> 01:10:26,380
when your original DMT trips,

1209
01:10:26,400 --> 01:10:30,130
you talked about how that you met some
kind of like visual spirit or something

1210
01:10:30,131 --> 01:10:33,550
like that and he was tailing like 3000
a million times or whenever that was.

1211
01:10:33,760 --> 01:10:37,960
Do you still love you talk to that exact
same guy or is there a new guy he got

1212
01:10:37,961 --> 01:10:38,794
fired?

1213
01:10:40,190 --> 01:10:40,900
It's,

1214
01:10:40,900 --> 01:10:44,860
there's a part that you go to that's like
the same place and the part you go to,

1215
01:10:44,861 --> 01:10:49,861
it's like these rotating columns that go
on in infinity and it's all like you're

1216
01:10:51,131 --> 01:10:52,090
a part of like this.

1217
01:10:52,091 --> 01:10:55,570
You see like the gears and the mechanisms
of the universe it feels like and it's

1218
01:10:55,571 --> 01:10:58,240
filled with entities like
whatever this thing is,

1219
01:10:58,241 --> 01:11:02,110
it's filled with like these conscious
entities where it feels like conscious

1220
01:11:02,111 --> 01:11:06,790
entities and sometimes they
talk to you in English and some.

1221
01:11:06,791 --> 01:11:08,010
This last time they were there,

1222
01:11:08,011 --> 01:11:10,990
were there talking to me and like
a language that wasn't even real.

1223
01:11:11,260 --> 01:11:14,140
Like they were talking to
me and like they were like,

1224
01:11:14,190 --> 01:11:14,850
there were,

1225
01:11:14,850 --> 01:11:18,840
there were saying were like they were
saying like things that didn't make any

1226
01:11:18,841 --> 01:11:23,760
sense and showing you things and if you
thought negative in any way, like you,

1227
01:11:24,180 --> 01:11:26,470
they would go like, Duh, Duh, Duh Duh
Duh Duh Duh Duh, Duh, Duh Dah, Dah, Dah,

1228
01:11:26,800 --> 01:11:29,430
like finger would shake back and forth
and then, then, and then and then, uh,

1229
01:11:29,700 --> 01:11:33,240
and then if you calm yourself and
thought positive, that would calm down.

1230
01:11:33,241 --> 01:11:34,051
But it was like letting,

1231
01:11:34,051 --> 01:11:37,380
you know every time you slipped into any
sort of a negative pattern of thinking.

1232
01:11:37,860 --> 01:11:40,170
And it was exposing a lot of the,

1233
01:11:40,830 --> 01:11:43,920
the ideas that I was thinking that were
important, that weren't important at all.

1234
01:11:44,110 --> 01:11:49,080
So it's all ego based ideas,
ideas about, you know, um,

1235
01:11:49,140 --> 01:11:52,920
how you, how you address or
how you look or you know,

1236
01:11:52,950 --> 01:11:55,710
whether your car is dirty and
whether you're not, you know,

1237
01:11:55,980 --> 01:12:00,390
whether you make x amount a year or y
amount of year, whether you, you know,

1238
01:12:00,450 --> 01:12:04,740
with all these ideas that we
have connected to ourselves
that like infest our

1239
01:12:04,741 --> 01:12:07,380
brain and there are there all the
time. It was letting me know, like,

1240
01:12:07,381 --> 01:12:11,430
you're spending too much time thinking
about stuff that's not important.

1241
01:12:11,670 --> 01:12:14,340
It's like showing it to me like
over and over and over again,

1242
01:12:14,610 --> 01:12:18,300
but it didn't do that thing where it says,
I love you. It didn't say, look at this.

1243
01:12:18,540 --> 01:12:22,260
Like the one time it was like, they
were like, I love you 600 million,

1244
01:12:22,261 --> 01:12:26,580
500,000 times, look at this. And every
time they will say, look at this,

1245
01:12:26,610 --> 01:12:31,200
it would become this even more beautiful
thing. Well that's good. It was weird.

1246
01:12:31,201 --> 01:12:34,980
But this one again,
I did to these ICAROS these songs.

1247
01:12:35,010 --> 01:12:38,950
You're going to do it
tomorrow? No. Oh No, no, no.

1248
01:12:38,951 --> 01:12:43,440
I get it on this Joe. I can't do, but
the three teaspoons of cough medicine,

1249
01:12:43,441 --> 01:12:47,100
they fucking shaky. That's not true,
but you could. You could have a drink.

1250
01:12:47,130 --> 01:12:52,000
You can have a little Xanax. Have a little
of that. I don't drink. Was that why?

1251
01:12:52,170 --> 01:12:55,830
What happens will be your
heart slows down too much. Oh,

1252
01:12:55,900 --> 01:12:58,990
a lot of people die from
tranquilizer. Alcohol mix. Yeah.

1253
01:12:59,000 --> 01:12:59,880
I got to wait for those people.

1254
01:13:02,220 --> 01:13:04,170
You're pushing for die and we'll see.

1255
01:13:04,171 --> 01:13:07,570
You can't take a little fucking Valium
and a little whiskey. Holy Shit.

1256
01:13:08,670 --> 01:13:11,560
That's how Merle haggard became famous.
I saw Johnny Cash made songs.

1257
01:13:12,110 --> 01:13:14,280
Got To do it,
son makes it up.

1258
01:13:14,281 --> 01:13:16,650
All those country music guys
used to fucking party hard.

1259
01:13:16,920 --> 01:13:21,780
That was a big shocker to people that
saw that Johnny Cash moving a walk the

1260
01:13:21,781 --> 01:13:26,210
line. Everybody was like, what? They were
all pilled up like what the fuck? Yeah.

1261
01:13:27,370 --> 01:13:31,410
A lot of musicians, musician, when they
used to call it a, what'd they call it?

1262
01:13:31,411 --> 01:13:35,220
Before marijuana was
before it was called weed.

1263
01:13:36,090 --> 01:13:39,900
I forget, but anyway, it's like
a grass, maybe grass. Yeah.

1264
01:13:40,900 --> 01:13:45,900
What's that noise? That outside?
Yeah. It's that song coming back.

1265
01:13:50,910 --> 01:13:53,820
Well, this is a very different podcast
show. I never thought I'd get nervous.

1266
01:13:53,821 --> 01:13:56,570
And your podcast nervous.
Well, I started with the,

1267
01:13:56,640 --> 01:14:01,140
the head stuff gets me a little does it
then you should do it. Fuck though. No,

1268
01:14:01,830 --> 01:14:06,510
we killed me. They, uh, they give you
the finger, they look like jokers.

1269
01:14:06,870 --> 01:14:10,440
They have like joker masks on and you
see them when your eyes are open or your

1270
01:14:10,441 --> 01:14:12,220
eyes and close,
your eyes are closed.

1271
01:14:12,370 --> 01:14:14,290
You see him way more visual.

1272
01:14:14,320 --> 01:14:17,530
The visuals are way more potent than
anything you could ever see with your eyes

1273
01:14:17,531 --> 01:14:21,400
open. They give you the finger and they're
spinning around giving you the finger.

1274
01:14:22,490 --> 01:14:24,970
But they're having fun with you.
They're letting you know, like stop.

1275
01:14:25,090 --> 01:14:28,660
I think it's their way of telling
you not to take yourself seriously.

1276
01:14:28,780 --> 01:14:31,990
What did it say? Look where we are. Like
you, you take yourself seriously, dude.

1277
01:14:32,080 --> 01:14:35,080
Where we're in another dimension
and we're fucking mocking you.

1278
01:14:35,090 --> 01:14:38,510
You're creating it right. Your brain's
created. I don't know. Yeah, I would take,

1279
01:14:38,560 --> 01:14:42,480
I would think so. You think there's
really something out there? What?

1280
01:14:43,240 --> 01:14:45,970
I don't know and this is the
best way to describe it. Um,

1281
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:49,660
I don't know what life is.
I think life itself,

1282
01:14:49,661 --> 01:14:54,310
like this life that we live is,
if it didn't exist, if you, uh,

1283
01:14:54,340 --> 01:14:58,060
if you, if you said, if he just, you know,

1284
01:14:58,090 --> 01:15:00,230
you were creating a universe,
you had no,

1285
01:15:00,250 --> 01:15:04,210
no point of reference and he said we're
going to have a bunch of people that the

1286
01:15:04,211 --> 01:15:07,540
way they interact and let each other
know what's on their mind is they make

1287
01:15:07,541 --> 01:15:11,830
noises with their face and
then everybody's noises
are different depending on

1288
01:15:11,831 --> 01:15:14,290
what patch of land you're in.
And those,

1289
01:15:14,440 --> 01:15:19,210
those noises represent like shit
that we've written down with symbols.

1290
01:15:19,330 --> 01:15:20,920
But everybody's symbols are different too.

1291
01:15:21,130 --> 01:15:24,190
Like there's some similar ones that a
lot of people use in different places,

1292
01:15:24,191 --> 01:15:26,570
but then the Russians, they change
them up and the Chinese change,

1293
01:15:26,571 --> 01:15:30,040
him and the Japanese have their own
system and Koreans have their own shit.

1294
01:15:30,041 --> 01:15:35,041
And then Spanish people use fucking
like water slides over the top of their

1295
01:15:35,531 --> 01:15:38,080
ends. You know, everything's,
everything's weird, right?

1296
01:15:38,081 --> 01:15:41,110
And the only way they communicate
with each other is by doing this.

1297
01:15:41,111 --> 01:15:45,100
And then someone came along and they
invented a translator, so you'd take copy,

1298
01:15:45,460 --> 01:15:47,950
big slabs of pay of of texts.

1299
01:15:48,100 --> 01:15:52,000
You throw it into Google translate and
it spits back up some broken English

1300
01:15:52,001 --> 01:15:55,780
version of what that person is saying.
That's just, that alone is weird.

1301
01:15:55,781 --> 01:15:59,080
The fact that there's a planet with
these types of people, these entities,

1302
01:15:59,230 --> 01:16:02,890
and they're sending photos of each
other, they're, they're fucking,

1303
01:16:02,891 --> 01:16:04,870
they're flying and metal tubes.

1304
01:16:05,020 --> 01:16:09,310
They're broadcasting video through the
sky and you could pick it up on your

1305
01:16:09,311 --> 01:16:14,110
phone and you could watch it. I
mean, that alone is very psychedelic.

1306
01:16:14,140 --> 01:16:17,200
It's just, we don't think of
it because we keep doing it.

1307
01:16:17,230 --> 01:16:20,740
We what we do as Comedians
is entirely psychedelic.

1308
01:16:20,950 --> 01:16:24,680
When you're on stage this weekend at the
laugh factory and you're killing killed,

1309
01:16:24,700 --> 01:16:28,510
hello. When you're doing that, you're,

1310
01:16:28,511 --> 01:16:30,790
that's like a form of mass hypnosis.

1311
01:16:30,791 --> 01:16:35,350
You got those people locked into the
way you're thinking and your doing

1312
01:16:35,351 --> 01:16:40,351
something to their body by you talking
and you talking in his expert rhythm of

1313
01:16:40,601 --> 01:16:43,990
the master standup comedian and hitting
all the punch lines and thank you.

1314
01:16:43,991 --> 01:16:46,120
Good night. And they're
like, whoa, what a show.

1315
01:16:46,270 --> 01:16:50,470
They laughed and all you did was make
noises with your mouth that represent

1316
01:16:50,471 --> 01:16:54,700
ideas that you can introduce into their
head that they wouldn't have ordinarily

1317
01:16:54,701 --> 01:16:58,000
pieced together. Like my
act, I know your work,

1318
01:16:58,360 --> 01:16:59,920
but that psychedelic.

1319
01:17:00,520 --> 01:17:04,780
So what is going on when you take a drug
and you see these things with your eyes

1320
01:17:04,781 --> 01:17:09,010
closed? I'm not sure cause it seems like
they're way fucking smarter than me.

1321
01:17:09,260 --> 01:17:10,940
It seems like they're mocking me.

1322
01:17:10,970 --> 01:17:15,970
They understand me and they're so beyond
anything that I could ever experience

1323
01:17:17,061 --> 01:17:20,200
on this planet.
It seems like if,

1324
01:17:21,060 --> 01:17:25,860
I don't know if there is anything other
than this dimension, I don't know.

1325
01:17:26,040 --> 01:17:30,130
But scientists seem to explain it
in some sort of a way where I'm,

1326
01:17:30,131 --> 01:17:33,600
I'm willing to listen to them, but I
don't, there's definitely something else.

1327
01:17:33,601 --> 01:17:38,400
Whether, I mean just the fact that
this is all Adams and it's moving,

1328
01:17:38,500 --> 01:17:43,200
everything's moving is beyond
my scope. I mean, I can't,

1329
01:17:43,580 --> 01:17:47,800
like if you said something one time, I
think we were sitting on stage and about,

1330
01:17:48,160 --> 01:17:48,540
you know,

1331
01:17:48,540 --> 01:17:53,540
we have no control over us or a
journey through space as a planet.

1332
01:17:54,390 --> 01:17:58,950
And the thing that's interesting to me
is we have absolutely no control. I mean,

1333
01:17:58,951 --> 01:18:03,360
if this planet just dropped
for some gravitational reason,

1334
01:18:03,660 --> 01:18:06,240
there's nothing we could do.
What if it just started falling?

1335
01:18:06,450 --> 01:18:09,410
That's what I'm saying.
Like there's a whole solid system.

1336
01:18:09,480 --> 01:18:13,500
Everything's spinning and our pants drops.
What would we do? I mean, well, yeah,

1337
01:18:13,501 --> 01:18:17,400
we're going, oh fuck. Getting my salary
ship. Somebody puts something in my drink.

1338
01:18:17,880 --> 01:18:22,350
There's nothing you can do. Yeah,
we're fleas. Well, that's not a dog.

1339
01:18:22,620 --> 01:18:25,560
That's what cracks me up.
People who are so full of themselves,

1340
01:18:25,600 --> 01:18:28,530
but what are you fucking cocky for?
Wouldn't even know what we're doing here.

1341
01:18:28,560 --> 01:18:29,180
That's what they do

1342
01:18:29,180 --> 01:18:31,940
value. When you do DMT, that's
what those things are doing.

1343
01:18:31,941 --> 01:18:34,550
When they're giving you the finger,
they're like, ah, you fucking idiot.

1344
01:18:34,551 --> 01:18:35,570
You take yourself seriously

1345
01:18:35,810 --> 01:18:39,710
it wouldn't it be cool if it was always
there? Those guys are always around you.

1346
01:18:39,711 --> 01:18:39,921
And when,

1347
01:18:39,921 --> 01:18:43,070
only thing that psychedelics does his
speed down your timing belt a little.

1348
01:18:43,071 --> 01:18:43,701
So you can see,

1349
01:18:43,701 --> 01:18:46,940
I'm kind of like where dogs are always
barking at and invisible things and

1350
01:18:46,941 --> 01:18:47,900
sometimes dogs.

1351
01:18:48,260 --> 01:18:52,340
What if dog seed that DMT the whole
time with you mixed into dogs barking

1352
01:18:52,360 --> 01:18:55,640
invisible things to hear sound.
Yeah, let's do you came here

1353
01:18:56,050 --> 01:19:00,490
dimethyltryptamine Oh, Rick Strassman
will be on the podcast folks.

1354
01:19:00,770 --> 01:19:05,290
He'll be, uh, on, uh, sometime
soon. We're working out the date,

1355
01:19:05,530 --> 01:19:10,400
but uh, I'll be, uh, I'll be
talking to him soon. He'll
be flying in. It either be a,

1356
01:19:10,450 --> 01:19:14,590
most likely it'd be October.
Looking forward to it. And
Rick Strassman for no one,

1357
01:19:14,620 --> 01:19:17,740
if anyone knows who he is, he's
one of the, anyone doesn't rather,

1358
01:19:17,741 --> 01:19:22,510
he's one of the first guys to ever
get permission from the Dea to do a

1359
01:19:22,511 --> 01:19:26,170
university studies on dimethyl trip to
me and on psychedelic drugs that are

1360
01:19:26,171 --> 01:19:28,560
schedule one drugs. And he did this, um,

1361
01:19:28,870 --> 01:19:33,490
series of tests out of the University
of New Mexico and wrote a book about it

1362
01:19:33,491 --> 01:19:34,301
called Dmt,

1363
01:19:34,301 --> 01:19:39,301
the spirit molecule where they were
injecting intravenous DMT into people's

1364
01:19:39,431 --> 01:19:44,230
bodies where it's the biggest,
the longest trip. If you smoke it,

1365
01:19:44,231 --> 01:19:45,640
it goes directly into your bloodstream,

1366
01:19:45,641 --> 01:19:49,900
but your body brings it back to baseline
and about 10 to 15 minutes depending

1367
01:19:49,901 --> 01:19:52,690
upon the dose. But if you
inject it, it takes a half hour.

1368
01:19:53,170 --> 01:19:56,980
And apparently these people
all had like these intense,

1369
01:19:57,070 --> 01:20:01,630
intense DMT trips like when I'm talking
about, but that went on for 30 minutes.

1370
01:20:01,660 --> 01:20:03,730
Fuck that. Right. Fuck that again.

1371
01:20:04,580 --> 01:20:07,160
Sign me up. So you would
do at 30 minute one. Yeah,

1372
01:20:07,340 --> 01:20:11,020
dude, I did five of them the other
day. I did one after the other. Yeah.

1373
01:20:11,030 --> 01:20:15,680
We kept doing it to him. It was
amazing. Yeah. You walk out of there,

1374
01:20:15,890 --> 01:20:20,180
you feel better about life,
you feel better about people,

1375
01:20:20,300 --> 01:20:23,420
you'll feel sorry for like angry,

1376
01:20:23,421 --> 01:20:27,320
shitty people instead of being mad
back at them. You feel sorry for them.

1377
01:20:27,470 --> 01:20:29,240
And you're not concerned
with any side effects?

1378
01:20:29,340 --> 01:20:31,440
No, none. There's none.

1379
01:20:32,320 --> 01:20:35,400
I think the side effects that I had
when I did it those years ago when I was

1380
01:20:35,401 --> 01:20:36,270
talking to you about it,

1381
01:20:36,840 --> 01:20:41,130
I think a lot of those side effects were
based on where I was in my head at that

1382
01:20:41,131 --> 01:20:43,890
time,
that it was so obliterating.

1383
01:20:44,160 --> 01:20:47,940
And then it took me a while to sort of
come to grips with what I learned from

1384
01:20:47,941 --> 01:20:52,740
that experience. But this, this
experience, um, which is, uh,

1385
01:20:53,100 --> 01:20:54,960
at least two years since my last one,

1386
01:20:55,320 --> 01:21:00,090
this experience was only
positive. It wasn't, there
was nothing negative about it.

1387
01:21:00,091 --> 01:21:01,590
It's like I was ready for this experience.

1388
01:21:01,830 --> 01:21:03,930
Like instead of it like
knocking me in the dirt,

1389
01:21:03,960 --> 01:21:06,710
I had learned enough from
my last one that I had, I,

1390
01:21:07,010 --> 01:21:09,600
I came into it with a
good in a good place.

1391
01:21:09,840 --> 01:21:13,980
Like you're always going to have like
a certain amount of ridicule from them.

1392
01:21:14,250 --> 01:21:18,570
Like you're always getting at, like, it'll
put a lot of your ideas and your, uh,

1393
01:21:19,410 --> 01:21:22,470
like a lot of your, like what do you
think is important in a perspective?

1394
01:21:22,710 --> 01:21:27,300
So I think like that always happens
because I think being a person stopping at

1395
01:21:27,301 --> 01:21:30,930
red lights, talking to people, dealing
with customer service on the phone,

1396
01:21:30,931 --> 01:21:32,280
like develop a,

1397
01:21:32,430 --> 01:21:37,430
just a certain pattern of behavior that
you think is normal for existing in

1398
01:21:37,471 --> 01:21:42,471
society and that that normalcy you
carry around with you like a shield.

1399
01:21:42,930 --> 01:21:47,930
And when you do DMT they go gimme that
they throw it away like you silly like

1400
01:21:48,931 --> 01:21:50,240
look at all this and they're,

1401
01:21:50,241 --> 01:21:55,140
they're showing you this insane
fractal universe that you exist in.

1402
01:21:55,170 --> 01:22:00,060
And it's only positive to me, but
that's me. I wouldn't advise it,

1403
01:22:00,180 --> 01:22:00,931
you know?
Like I said,

1404
01:22:00,931 --> 01:22:05,550
I had that one weird trip that fucked me
up for a couple of weeks and I'm pretty

1405
01:22:05,551 --> 01:22:08,790
stable. Insane in comparison
to a lot of people that I know.

1406
01:22:09,060 --> 01:22:12,150
So if you're not stable or not saying
or you're having real problems,

1407
01:22:12,151 --> 01:22:15,960
I wouldn't recommend you doing it
right here. That's me. That's you.

1408
01:22:16,350 --> 01:22:17,670
I would recommend you doing it though.

1409
01:22:17,950 --> 01:22:19,150
Yeah, I mean, I'm very,

1410
01:22:20,680 --> 01:22:25,030
I've had a few bad trips we've talked
about in the past and I've still done it

1411
01:22:25,210 --> 01:22:27,100
even though knowing those bad trips.

1412
01:22:27,130 --> 01:22:30,310
But there was also like a recent time
where I did mushrooms where I remember

1413
01:22:30,311 --> 01:22:32,110
going, you know what? I
think I'm done with this.

1414
01:22:32,111 --> 01:22:35,200
Just I'm not going to learn anything
more from this. This is now.

1415
01:22:35,201 --> 01:22:39,280
It's just kind of like me fucking with
my brain that hopefully everything works

1416
01:22:39,281 --> 01:22:43,500
out okay. You know, definitely
learned a lot by herself. I'll still,

1417
01:22:43,540 --> 01:22:46,660
I'm not writing it off, but it,
there was, that's what I felt.

1418
01:22:46,661 --> 01:22:50,860
My last trip though when I was in my trip,
it just getting stuck in there.

1419
01:22:51,370 --> 01:22:52,110
Eddie Bravo

1420
01:22:52,110 --> 01:22:56,070
two artists. Um, I forgot the gentleman's
name, but uh, he's a really good tattoo.

1421
01:22:56,110 --> 01:23:00,320
Two hours to go do the Biomek stuff
on his arm. He did DMT like a hundred.

1422
01:23:00,530 --> 01:23:04,880
He's in a row
and somewhere you,

1423
01:23:05,260 --> 01:23:05,980
somewhere during

1424
01:23:05,980 --> 01:23:10,360
the trip, the DMT entities
like, hey, hey, hey, no more.

1425
01:23:10,540 --> 01:23:15,370
Stop enough. Like they were
telling him, you gotta stop
doing this. Wow. But he was,

1426
01:23:15,970 --> 01:23:17,920
he was creating all this
artwork and all this.

1427
01:23:17,980 --> 01:23:22,150
He's having all these visions and he
wanted to be in the DMT realm more than he

1428
01:23:22,151 --> 01:23:23,710
wanted to be in the regular world.

1429
01:23:23,860 --> 01:23:27,670
So he's like pulling back from
the regular world. He was like,

1430
01:23:27,700 --> 01:23:29,500
he didn't want to interact with people.

1431
01:23:29,501 --> 01:23:31,960
He just couldn't wait to get back
to his house to get blasted again.

1432
01:23:31,961 --> 01:23:33,490
So he'd go into hyperspace.

1433
01:23:33,540 --> 01:23:36,930
When you finally get into just the DMT,
Rome, you just become homeless. Right.

1434
01:23:36,960 --> 01:23:40,770
That's what those guys are probably on
the streets. They've done so much drugs.

1435
01:23:40,771 --> 01:23:42,730
Most of them mixed with,
you know, you know,

1436
01:23:42,750 --> 01:23:45,070
schizophrenia and their backgrounds maybe,
but it,

1437
01:23:45,150 --> 01:23:47,820
those are just people that have
fucked their brains up. Right.

1438
01:23:48,020 --> 01:23:50,760
I don't know. I mean, I think a lot
of people are just mentally ill.

1439
01:23:50,820 --> 01:23:53,370
I don't think they've done it
necessarily to themselves with drugs.

1440
01:23:53,371 --> 01:23:56,190
I think there's,
that would be unfair to assume.

1441
01:23:56,220 --> 01:23:59,790
I think a lot of those guys are just
people. Look, some people get cancer,

1442
01:23:59,820 --> 01:24:04,160
some people have, you know, serious
diseases. I have hypothyroidism.

1443
01:24:04,410 --> 01:24:09,240
Some people have, uh, no.
Yeah, yeah, I have that. It's
hereditary. My mother has it.

1444
01:24:10,500 --> 01:24:15,090
Um, I take a thyroid medication.
What does, so it, it fixes it,

1445
01:24:15,420 --> 01:24:19,530
but, which really fixes it
fun. It doesn't, it doesn't
affect me at all, but, uh,

1446
01:24:19,531 --> 01:24:21,450
it would make me real tired
towards the end of the day.

1447
01:24:21,460 --> 01:24:22,950
Right when I was on fear factor,

1448
01:24:22,951 --> 01:24:26,400
I started getting concerned because
I was getting these weird headaches.

1449
01:24:26,430 --> 01:24:28,350
They were weird.
Like at the end of the day I'd be,

1450
01:24:28,380 --> 01:24:33,180
I would be so exhausted and I was getting
these headaches where it was like my

1451
01:24:33,181 --> 01:24:37,620
head was just compressed and it felt
like the only solution was to sleep.

1452
01:24:37,710 --> 01:24:41,040
Like I would fall asleep, like watching
TV and I was like, this is not normal.

1453
01:24:41,190 --> 01:24:43,680
It does not. No, no. I know
what a normal tired feels like.

1454
01:24:43,681 --> 01:24:46,320
This is not feel like a
normal tired and uh, I have,

1455
01:24:46,350 --> 01:24:50,190
they call it Hashimoto's disease and it's,
um,

1456
01:24:50,220 --> 01:24:54,120
to some weird hereditary failure of your,
your thyroid gland.

1457
01:24:54,150 --> 01:24:58,920
That's part of the endocrine system. Yeah.
Yeah. It's just comes from, you know,

1458
01:24:58,921 --> 01:25:01,830
I mean, what, they don't know what it
comes from, but a lot of people get it.

1459
01:25:02,340 --> 01:25:04,160
My ex girlfriend had,
I remember he helped her

1460
01:25:04,350 --> 01:25:07,490
because she was having really bad
ups and downs and she tried all these

1461
01:25:07,491 --> 01:25:09,350
different ones.
Then you turned around to this one.

1462
01:25:09,800 --> 01:25:11,000
Yeah.
Armour thyroid.

1463
01:25:11,060 --> 01:25:15,260
Armour thyroid is made from pigs thyroids
and it's very biocompatible to human

1464
01:25:15,261 --> 01:25:17,690
beings and it makes it essentially
like you don't have an issue.

1465
01:25:17,960 --> 01:25:19,280
But I had the other stuff,

1466
01:25:19,281 --> 01:25:22,970
the different thyroid medications weren't
the so good until I got this stuff.

1467
01:25:23,000 --> 01:25:26,240
Yeah. Yeah. There's a lot of people
that have it, man. Super Common.

1468
01:25:26,330 --> 01:25:27,490
Sometimes it's a,

1469
01:25:27,500 --> 01:25:29,870
I would never have guessed that because
you have so much fucking energy.

1470
01:25:29,960 --> 01:25:33,740
That was what was weird to them. They
didn't understand why I was so lean when,

1471
01:25:33,741 --> 01:25:38,040
when they brought me in, they
tested me. They were like,
you know, like how come, uh,

1472
01:25:38,090 --> 01:25:41,120
has this affected your weight? Have you
gotten fat? And I'm was like, not at all.

1473
01:25:41,720 --> 01:25:44,330
No, because I was, I would
push through it, you know,

1474
01:25:44,331 --> 01:25:47,450
even though I would be tired
and forced myself to work out.

1475
01:25:47,660 --> 01:25:52,070
And when you're doing Jujitsu, um,
it's so intense that you, you, you,

1476
01:25:52,220 --> 01:25:55,610
you're fighting for your life essentially.
When you're on the mat and so there's,

1477
01:25:55,750 --> 01:25:57,710
there's no way you can half ass a workout.

1478
01:25:57,740 --> 01:25:59,900
So I stayed lien even
though I had this issue,

1479
01:25:59,930 --> 01:26:01,790
but it was definitely
affecting my endurance.

1480
01:26:02,060 --> 01:26:04,070
Like I noticed a
difference since I started

1481
01:26:04,070 --> 01:26:08,720
taking it and now you're back to normal.
Totally normal. Yeah. But um, you know,

1482
01:26:08,900 --> 01:26:12,350
people have weird things. I mean you
were talking about kidney stones.

1483
01:26:12,440 --> 01:26:15,110
Some people have, you know, some
people have kidney diseases,

1484
01:26:15,111 --> 01:26:17,150
some people have failure of their,
their fucking,

1485
01:26:17,240 --> 01:26:20,060
the what rich Vos and Bonnie
Mcfarlane have his next door neighbor.

1486
01:26:20,061 --> 01:26:22,580
They were talking about it on
the, uh, the radio show today,

1487
01:26:22,780 --> 01:26:24,860
who's losing his liver.
His liver is dying.

1488
01:26:25,040 --> 01:26:28,370
He drank too much and he killed his
liver and there was waiting for a fucking

1489
01:26:28,371 --> 01:26:33,080
transplant. Shit goes wrong,
man. The body, the body
doesn't always work forever.

1490
01:26:33,410 --> 01:26:38,360
Nobody gets out alive. Delude.
It's do, do, do, do, do, do
I have a drink? And Again,

1491
01:26:38,510 --> 01:26:43,460
oh Jesus, Dom, now you, now you tell
us you want to drink right now. No.

1492
01:26:43,670 --> 01:26:46,580
Okay, good. It's a test. That
means you could put it away.

1493
01:26:47,450 --> 01:26:50,570
He didn't get all shaky in the head.
Oh, wake up fucking drunk every day.

1494
01:26:51,050 --> 01:26:53,330
Every day. Every day. Wow.

1495
01:26:53,510 --> 01:26:56,450
Just to give yourself a day off
and I was thinking about that.

1496
01:26:56,460 --> 01:27:00,650
Maybe tonight we'll play some pool
after this. Give yourself a break.

1497
01:27:00,680 --> 01:27:02,690
You don't want to play pool drunk.
He'd be upset with yourself.

1498
01:27:03,320 --> 01:27:07,290
Do you enjoy drinking water? It is
water hard for you to drink. I love you.

1499
01:27:07,330 --> 01:27:11,660
A drink of water. I hate water.
Do you enjoy drinking water?

1500
01:27:12,500 --> 01:27:17,420
I mean, I like Tang heat water
and why just doesn't do it for me.

1501
01:27:17,580 --> 01:27:21,830
I, I'd rather drink Gatorade, but
I bought her. Terrible for you.

1502
01:27:22,720 --> 01:27:25,790
Let me, it's not bad for you after you
work out because you need to replenish the

1503
01:27:25,791 --> 01:27:28,260
shutters, the lecturer
to in sugars too. Right?

1504
01:27:28,310 --> 01:27:31,790
Like one of the best things
after you workout is actually
chocolate milk. Really?

1505
01:27:32,500 --> 01:27:34,010
Yeah.
Chocolate milk is great,

1506
01:27:34,011 --> 01:27:36,950
especially after you lift weights because
it has a little bit of protein in it.

1507
01:27:37,220 --> 01:27:40,730
Um, it has a milk, milk proteins. Uh,

1508
01:27:40,731 --> 01:27:43,340
it also has a caisson,
I think it's called,

1509
01:27:43,640 --> 01:27:47,030
and a sugar because of the
chocolate syrup and all that jazz.

1510
01:27:47,060 --> 01:27:50,840
It actually replenishes your
glycogen. It's really, it's
like the best. That's me.

1511
01:27:50,841 --> 01:27:51,674
And chocolate milk.

1512
01:27:56,320 --> 01:28:00,580
Sexy as fuck. Where's this show me? That
was all long time ago, man. That's a

1513
01:28:02,810 --> 01:28:05,120
early two thousands,
somewhere around there. I,

1514
01:28:05,160 --> 01:28:07,400
we've known each other a
long time brother. Yeah, man.

1515
01:28:07,970 --> 01:28:11,200
We'd known each other since the 90s.
My brother Dominique,

1516
01:28:11,390 --> 01:28:15,350
we played pool at Amsterdam
billiards and like 1993 or so.

1517
01:28:15,351 --> 01:28:18,410
You had just gotten that show I think.
I don't even think I had it yet.

1518
01:28:18,470 --> 01:28:21,500
They didn't have it yet, so I think
I'd just done your show. I did that,

1519
01:28:21,980 --> 01:28:25,620
that showtime thing with you in Montreal
and then we ran into each other.

1520
01:28:25,621 --> 01:28:30,560
So it Amsterdam. Yeah, that was great.
The one on the upper west side was great.

1521
01:28:30,561 --> 01:28:34,400
The new one's great too. It's on the east
side. I haven't seen it. Where is it? Uh,

1522
01:28:34,610 --> 01:28:36,980
uh,
I don't remember the s to see the streets,

1523
01:28:37,220 --> 01:28:40,730
but it's like lower numbers
on the east side. It's great.

1524
01:28:40,910 --> 01:28:45,830
It's like New York has a bunch of
pool halls, but la, they're all gone,

1525
01:28:45,831 --> 01:28:49,780
man. They're all gone. All the pools
when Hollywood billiards, we went,

1526
01:28:50,530 --> 01:28:54,800
it was fun too. The other one, we
could take the girls up. Oh yeah.

1527
01:28:55,640 --> 01:28:59,350
Hollywood athletic club. Yeah, that
was great. That was back in the 90s.

1528
01:28:59,420 --> 01:29:02,280
Thumb a neck bourbon. Still a
good one. Yeah. They still have,

1529
01:29:02,281 --> 01:29:04,740
what does it fantasia or something
like that. Yeah. That's a good one.

1530
01:29:05,100 --> 01:29:08,370
This is a nice table you got here.
Yeah, that's a good table. That's a,

1531
01:29:08,371 --> 01:29:13,110
that's an old gold crown too. That's from
the 1970s. I'm excited to write a range.

1532
01:29:13,111 --> 01:29:16,230
Pockets. My friend.
Very small. No, really?

1533
01:29:16,280 --> 01:29:19,590
Oh they gonna hurt your soul
going to bring, uh, yeah.

1534
01:29:19,591 --> 01:29:22,740
This guy or Nesto Domingez
top pool player. He uh,

1535
01:29:22,770 --> 01:29:27,410
he's also a great table mechanic and his
brother has a son rather Oscar Domingez

1536
01:29:27,450 --> 01:29:32,060
a top pro. And uh, they, uh, they make
these, uh, these, they cut these table.

1537
01:29:32,090 --> 01:29:34,710
I made this, will they, uh,
they, they built the table.

1538
01:29:35,130 --> 01:29:39,630
So they make these table openings
like four inch holes. So it's very,

1539
01:29:39,900 --> 01:29:43,590
very difficult. It's a normal
one. Five it's a big difference.

1540
01:29:46,950 --> 01:29:48,920
My back's going to be
killing me from rack and

1541
01:29:50,430 --> 01:29:53,310
that's how I would do if there
was a, if, if I couldn't,

1542
01:29:53,790 --> 01:29:56,850
if I couldn't do standup anymore,
I would try playing pool professionally.

1543
01:29:57,180 --> 01:30:00,120
I tried going on the tour if there
was a tour tours kind of dead.

1544
01:30:00,121 --> 01:30:03,120
Now it's amazing because it's
such a great, great sport.

1545
01:30:03,300 --> 01:30:04,650
P needs a television show,

1546
01:30:05,270 --> 01:30:08,970
pull needs like Larry the cable guy and
to travel the country. You're right.

1547
01:30:09,810 --> 01:30:12,750
They did. It needs, it needs something.
I thought about doing it for awhile.

1548
01:30:12,810 --> 01:30:16,350
I thought about doing a show where I go
from town to town and play the best guy

1549
01:30:16,351 --> 01:30:19,170
in the house or something like that,
but people would get bored.

1550
01:30:19,740 --> 01:30:23,700
I told you this before, you got too
much going in your life to become a pro.

1551
01:30:23,820 --> 01:30:26,670
Who took put in the practice it
would take to be a pro. I know,

1552
01:30:26,671 --> 01:30:29,450
but I get obsessed, get obsessed
with things, done my room.

1553
01:30:29,620 --> 01:30:33,690
You get obsessed with anything.
If you get the old fucking moves back,

1554
01:30:33,691 --> 01:30:35,310
you wouldn't try it.
A little bit of pro ball,

1555
01:30:35,670 --> 01:30:37,980
a little dribbling between the lanes.

1556
01:30:38,640 --> 01:30:43,470
People don't know you're a good basketball
player. Uh, that was like a chewed.

1557
01:30:44,640 --> 01:30:48,090
You could beat somebody at horse.
You think, fuck people up at horse.

1558
01:30:48,120 --> 01:30:49,110
I had these two kids.

1559
01:30:49,111 --> 01:30:52,140
I was in Ohio and I guess they heard I
could play basketball. They said, well,

1560
01:30:52,141 --> 01:30:55,650
you're a good basketball player. I
said, well, for a comedian, they go, uh,

1561
01:30:55,710 --> 01:30:59,550
could you jump? I go, I could grab the
rim. My height. That's a good jumping.

1562
01:30:59,570 --> 01:31:03,090
Where are fast? It goes really
fast. They go, you, you go.

1563
01:31:03,091 --> 01:31:04,830
Not what you're seeing now.
You fucking idiot.

1564
01:31:06,290 --> 01:31:10,950
I have this fucking bloated
old Chinese man. Fuck I am.

1565
01:31:12,150 --> 01:31:14,310
No,
no.

1566
01:31:14,330 --> 01:31:18,510
Like fucking 145 pounds a monkey muscle.
When you see,

1567
01:31:18,511 --> 01:31:23,070
when you see your face go, Chinese did,
do you have the urge to just walk around,

1568
01:31:24,090 --> 01:31:27,130
do whatever, the urge to fight it? I
don't know what happened. Is that as that,

1569
01:31:27,240 --> 01:31:29,460
is that a disease?
I didn't look at me.

1570
01:31:29,461 --> 01:31:31,080
I don't know what the
fuck happened to my head.

1571
01:31:31,140 --> 01:31:35,490
I think it's a lot of it is a water
retention. Alcohol probably. Yeah.

1572
01:31:35,880 --> 01:31:40,860
Your body fat rises. Your whole face
gets Chinese, like very moved by.

1573
01:31:40,890 --> 01:31:42,280
It should be honest with me.
At my worst,

1574
01:31:44,850 --> 01:31:48,990
if I lost too much weight, do
I look beautiful? I love you.

1575
01:31:48,991 --> 01:31:53,040
No matter what you look like. Um,
this, uh, it wish you were a hot chick.

1576
01:31:53,460 --> 01:31:54,700
This drinking thing.
Um,

1577
01:31:54,780 --> 01:31:57,810
is this something you want to do something
about it or you just kinda gotta I

1578
01:31:57,811 --> 01:31:59,970
gotta you gotta look for,

1579
01:31:59,980 --> 01:32:03,910
you've done it like cold Turkey,
right? Yeah. My doctor said,

1580
01:32:04,270 --> 01:32:07,890
just take a half a Xanax and you can,
I said, well, I go get, you know,

1581
01:32:07,940 --> 01:32:12,060
I get convulsions and shit if I stopped
drinking cold Turkey. He says, no, me.

1582
01:32:12,080 --> 01:32:15,790
I guess because my body was drew from
it all day today. You know what I mean?

1583
01:32:15,850 --> 01:32:18,690
That's not like I'm drinking.
I get up and have a drink and then you,

1584
01:32:18,720 --> 01:32:21,880
we asked me if I want to drink. Oh
yeah, go for one. It's not like that.

1585
01:32:22,480 --> 01:32:23,680
It's just you convenient.

1586
01:32:23,681 --> 01:32:25,750
Like it's a pattern that you fall
into when you go out at night.

1587
01:32:25,840 --> 01:32:30,570
I love being high and like, uh, I'll
sit there at night and I'll go around.

1588
01:32:30,590 --> 01:32:35,590
I'm going to have like two shots and I
go, all right. Six shots. Six shots. Yeah.

1589
01:32:35,650 --> 01:32:39,770
I just keep every night. What's your
main drink? Your main, your gut,

1590
01:32:39,820 --> 01:32:42,790
which I can reach. Uh, I like,

1591
01:32:42,791 --> 01:32:45,160
I'm Jay Jamison.

1592
01:32:46,210 --> 01:32:50,700
I looked up dirty martinis. Oh, so you'd
just drink straight with no mixers or,

1593
01:32:50,740 --> 01:32:54,490
yeah, maybe start doing large
drinks and then it's like, you know,

1594
01:32:54,491 --> 01:32:58,090
like I do Ginger Ale. No, he wants her
get drunk. See, I want to get drunk.

1595
01:32:58,091 --> 01:33:01,000
I don't want to get to know.
Trying to like sit there sipping.

1596
01:33:01,060 --> 01:33:05,920
I don't want to enjoy it. Like, Hey, hey,

1597
01:33:05,921 --> 01:33:09,160
Jackie is open up your Aa.
I put this umbrella and you drink.

1598
01:33:09,161 --> 01:33:13,030
It makes it more difficult to find in
the liquid. It's all not all happy.

1599
01:33:13,050 --> 01:33:15,410
Got to move it around and
makes you drink slow. Ah,

1600
01:33:15,520 --> 01:33:18,180
I fucking hate like Pina
coladas and shit like that.

1601
01:33:19,770 --> 01:33:23,680
Do you like getting caught in the rain?
I feel like the smell of the ocean,

1602
01:33:23,720 --> 01:33:27,040
of the tastes of champagne. I like Jimmy
Buffet and making love at midnight.

1603
01:33:27,070 --> 01:33:30,430
I don't think that was Jimmy Buffet.
If you like Pina coladas.

1604
01:33:31,660 --> 01:33:35,560
Who was that thought it was difficult,
but no, I don't believe so. Look it up,

1605
01:33:35,561 --> 01:33:39,910
motherfucker.
Shaking the day.

1606
01:33:39,990 --> 01:33:44,020
The chicken that they, I feel
like it's something. Someone
else. Yup. Jimmy Buffett.

1607
01:33:44,340 --> 01:33:48,130
Is it man?
Don't you bring your primitive?

1608
01:33:48,131 --> 01:33:51,760
That feels to me about music minster
rogue. No, it's Rupert Holmes.

1609
01:33:52,650 --> 01:33:54,970
Hey fucking knucklehead.
It says Jimmy Buffet.

1610
01:33:55,060 --> 01:33:59,350
Rupert Holmes recorded by
American singer Rupert Holmes.

1611
01:34:00,430 --> 01:34:04,720
I think it was made famous by Jimmy
Buffett. It's on the midnight special.

1612
01:34:04,721 --> 01:34:06,190
Burt Sugarman.
Here we go.

1613
01:34:11,390 --> 01:34:14,740
This is Rupert Holmes.
You're both right.

1614
01:34:16,750 --> 01:34:18,010
This is the famous one.

1615
01:34:22,920 --> 01:34:24,250
Yeah, that's it. It's Rupert Holmes,

1616
01:34:25,330 --> 01:34:29,470
so don't trust Brian red band to Google
anything for you that your life on it.

1617
01:34:29,471 --> 01:34:32,230
I played Jimmy Buffett's science.
Probably going to sound exactly the same,

1618
01:34:32,231 --> 01:34:34,610
but that's probably the one that played
the Jimmy Buffet. I want to hear it.

1619
01:34:35,320 --> 01:34:38,770
Jimmy Buffet. Well, this guys, this is
the guy who made that. He had the hit.

1620
01:34:38,920 --> 01:34:41,890
The guy who had the hit that was on
the radio is Rupert Holmes. Okay.

1621
01:34:43,440 --> 01:34:45,460
You're right.
I think I'm definitely right.

1622
01:34:45,490 --> 01:34:49,090
I know how to Google you Google
with your dick or something.

1623
01:34:49,150 --> 01:34:51,040
I don't even think you pay attention
to what you write in there.

1624
01:34:51,041 --> 01:34:55,090
I honestly thought that that
that was a Jimmy Buffett.

1625
01:34:55,091 --> 01:34:57,970
Jimmy Buffett is the fucking
Margaritaville guy and

1626
01:34:57,980 --> 01:35:00,120
maybe that's why he's not a Pina Colada.

1627
01:35:02,270 --> 01:35:06,940
How did we go over to look at about
the universe? Brian Redman, fucking,

1628
01:35:07,010 --> 01:35:11,290
he's the crowbar in any
intellectual discussion. Clang.

1629
01:35:11,650 --> 01:35:14,720
Your gears get ground up and then the,
the fucking elves give you the finger.

1630
01:35:15,110 --> 01:35:17,290
Look at things like this, like if
you like peanut clot, Jimmy Buffet,

1631
01:35:17,300 --> 01:35:20,210
I think that's an idiot that doesn't
know that it's not Jimmy Buffet.

1632
01:35:20,240 --> 01:35:21,920
That's just some more on youtube.

1633
01:35:22,190 --> 01:35:24,680
Unless Jimmy Buffett actually
sang a version of it.

1634
01:35:24,920 --> 01:35:28,900
See if we can find a Jimmy Buffet version
of it, but Jimmy Buffett was wasted,

1635
01:35:29,070 --> 01:35:32,040
man. Oh No.

1636
01:35:32,220 --> 01:35:36,900
He has a whole fucking station on Xm.
You can listen to Jimmy Buffet.

1637
01:35:36,930 --> 01:35:39,780
All of this. I don't think go with
the, if you're in Florida, you would,

1638
01:35:40,140 --> 01:35:44,160
if you were in Florida and you're
popping Xanax and drinking booze and just

1639
01:35:44,161 --> 01:35:48,330
fucking sitting on the feature,
you still right? No, never.

1640
01:35:48,930 --> 01:35:52,050
No. But you'd take a Xanax in the
morning and by the time it wears off,

1641
01:35:52,051 --> 01:35:54,630
then you're drinking. That's
how it works. Is there a,

1642
01:35:54,690 --> 01:35:58,140
is there a version of it where there's
one that when I was showing, you know,

1643
01:35:58,141 --> 01:35:58,591
you're right,

1644
01:35:58,591 --> 01:36:01,650
it's mostly all just repaired homes and
Jamie just shoved me something like the

1645
01:36:01,651 --> 01:36:06,480
five songs that people think are
from the wrong artists. Oh, okay.

1646
01:36:06,930 --> 01:36:11,070
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Because it seems like
it would be kind of a Jimmy Buffet Song,

1647
01:36:11,071 --> 01:36:13,140
but I knew it wasn't him and
it's because of Margaritaville.

1648
01:36:13,141 --> 01:36:14,850
I think you totally nailed it right there.

1649
01:36:14,850 --> 01:36:18,090
I think that's why I'm just immediately
thought it's one of those old ass songs

1650
01:36:18,091 --> 01:36:21,150
that you don't understand.
Like, um, like uh,

1651
01:36:22,230 --> 01:36:26,920
the things you do for love. Who
the fuck saying that? Like what

1652
01:36:33,020 --> 01:36:35,580
the fuck we're looking for the answer.
And I,

1653
01:36:35,930 --> 01:36:39,780
I had a copy of that when I was
a little kid. I was a little kid,

1654
01:36:39,781 --> 01:36:44,781
like maybe six or seven and we had a 45
of that song and things you do for love

1655
01:36:45,271 --> 01:36:49,620
was like, the first song I ever owned was
like, who the fuck knows? See if Brian,

1656
01:36:49,621 --> 01:36:53,790
I'll pull it up. Call me.
Hendrix, led Zeppelin,

1657
01:36:54,480 --> 01:36:58,310
the WHO?
It's a British band called 10 CC,

1658
01:36:58,560 --> 01:37:01,510
10 16 wow. Really? You know,

1659
01:37:01,511 --> 01:37:06,210
a friend of mine was on a cruise ship
and Robert Plant was on it and somebody

1660
01:37:06,211 --> 01:37:10,110
called, somebody called him led. Oh,

1661
01:37:10,111 --> 01:37:13,020
my daughter's name was lit.
What a disaster.

1662
01:37:13,260 --> 01:37:17,000
Why would Robert Plank go on a fucking,
why would he ever do that? Do you know?

1663
01:37:17,160 --> 01:37:18,540
Wrapped on a boat?
Oh,

1664
01:37:18,541 --> 01:37:22,870
I fucking know what to do.

1665
01:37:24,290 --> 01:37:27,000
I've been on fishing boats.
I don't like both set.

1666
01:37:29,730 --> 01:37:32,280
If I lived near a lake,
I would be in heaven.

1667
01:37:32,520 --> 01:37:36,030
If I lived in a lake and I could just
pull out like a nice bass boat out there

1668
01:37:36,031 --> 01:37:39,450
and go fishing. I love fishing. So fun.

1669
01:37:39,600 --> 01:37:43,200
So primal to some about
catching your dinner. You know,

1670
01:37:43,201 --> 01:37:47,190
he's throw that soccer on
ice, filet it, get home, cook
it, eat it. Very satisfying.

1671
01:37:47,490 --> 01:37:51,390
Something like caveman style satisfying.
It just feels great.

1672
01:37:51,880 --> 01:37:56,190
Have a couple of beers when you're
out there. Castle wine, enjoy the day.

1673
01:37:56,191 --> 01:37:59,900
Just go to the seafood
restaurant. Oh, dom, you say that?

1674
01:38:00,100 --> 01:38:04,200
Do you ever catch a big fish? It's fucking
fine. Look at me. Do I look like a fish?

1675
01:38:04,230 --> 01:38:08,560
I got to put up some youtube videos and
me and Ari, when we were, uh, in um,

1676
01:38:09,060 --> 01:38:13,830
uh, Alaska last summer we had a
great time. That was really manic.

1677
01:38:13,890 --> 01:38:16,170
We uh,
well that was that part too,

1678
01:38:16,710 --> 01:38:20,610
but we caught the salmon run like
right when the King Salmon Salmon,

1679
01:38:20,611 --> 01:38:23,490
we're running strong. Oh.
And we caught like seven,

1680
01:38:23,491 --> 01:38:27,510
eight fish a day and they
were giant like big 30,

1681
01:38:27,511 --> 01:38:31,440
40 pounds salmon. It was
so fun. I got some videos.

1682
01:38:31,441 --> 01:38:33,870
I need to put them up on Youtube.
I've had him for a while,

1683
01:38:33,871 --> 01:38:37,890
but we had a fucking blast
because we had a gig up there.

1684
01:38:38,160 --> 01:38:40,140
We set scheduled a Gig for one day,

1685
01:38:40,141 --> 01:38:44,670
but we went fishing for two days before
the Gig. It was so much fun. That's cool.

1686
01:38:44,920 --> 01:38:48,430
Did you see the video that
grouper eating a shark? Yes.

1687
01:38:49,200 --> 01:38:52,420
Put that shit up.
It's probably going to get us right.

1688
01:38:53,250 --> 01:38:57,000
This is the part of the show where we
say this will get us pulled from youtube.

1689
01:38:57,210 --> 01:39:00,840
If you, if you're tired of chicken getting
pulled from Youtube, folks go to Vimeo.

1690
01:39:00,841 --> 01:39:05,040
Vimeo doesn't pull things like youtube
does for whatever reason. But uh,

1691
01:39:05,100 --> 01:39:07,920
this grouper is groupers.
If you don't know,

1692
01:39:07,921 --> 01:39:11,280
they get to be like hundreds
of pounds there. Fucking huge.

1693
01:39:11,490 --> 01:39:13,020
So this guy is caught.

1694
01:39:13,021 --> 01:39:17,310
The Shark and the grouper
just gangs his fucking shark.

1695
01:39:17,580 --> 01:39:20,460
He's pulling the shark
in and it's so enormous.

1696
01:39:20,970 --> 01:39:25,970
I mean there are like four or 500 pounds
sometimes these Goliath groupers and it

1697
01:39:27,151 --> 01:39:30,150
comes up and it,
it's snatches his fucking shark.

1698
01:39:30,620 --> 01:39:33,570
Like he's got the shark floating around
at the top and the fish can't help

1699
01:39:33,571 --> 01:39:36,490
himself. He's like, fuck it. Here he goes,

1700
01:39:38,740 --> 01:39:42,910
look at this thing. Look at the size
of this fucking thing. One bite.

1701
01:39:43,960 --> 01:39:46,750
One bite inhales the entire shark.

1702
01:39:47,710 --> 01:39:51,400
Fucking unreal.
That's how big Goliath grouper is.

1703
01:39:51,850 --> 01:39:53,350
If you catch one of those bitches,

1704
01:39:53,590 --> 01:39:57,000
you're going to be pulling that thing
for hours. You're going to be hang on,

1705
01:39:57,890 --> 01:39:58,723
Aye.

1706
01:39:59,900 --> 01:40:02,660
I don't even like go into a seafood
restaurant and they tell you to cook your

1707
01:40:02,661 --> 01:40:07,260
own fish. Do they do that? And
boy I have seen it tell you.

1708
01:40:08,360 --> 01:40:12,470
Gotta clean my plate too, Dan.
Thanks. You like you go on a date.

1709
01:40:12,471 --> 01:40:16,280
It's like with doing activities,
we're cooking together.

1710
01:40:16,460 --> 01:40:21,190
Turn it over for me. I like
tipping fun. Do I take the brand?

1711
01:40:21,191 --> 01:40:24,590
I tip in the cheese.
Ooh, that's good too Joe.

1712
01:40:24,650 --> 01:40:27,490
People like the Korean barbecue.
We like you have the,

1713
01:40:27,491 --> 01:40:29,500
the the hot thing in front
of you and you slap down.

1714
01:40:29,630 --> 01:40:33,650
There's a place in the mall out here.
They do that. I love that. It's annoying.

1715
01:40:34,210 --> 01:40:36,290
I don't like it at all. No,
it's stupid. Any things?

1716
01:40:36,310 --> 01:40:41,030
He smells so bad when you leave.
If I was going to cook myself,

1717
01:40:41,060 --> 01:40:44,090
I wouldn't cook like that.
I like cooking over like charcoal,

1718
01:40:44,250 --> 01:40:47,060
like like lump charcoal.
Can you get that smoky flavor?

1719
01:40:47,810 --> 01:40:51,770
It's more about all you can eat. The,
Oh, was it all you can eat places?

1720
01:40:51,771 --> 01:40:54,010
Not all you can eat you,
you choose which meat

1721
01:40:54,010 --> 01:40:58,780
group you want. Like you get there be like
an $18 per person, 24, $30 in of the 31.

1722
01:40:58,781 --> 01:40:59,650
You get a different menu.

1723
01:40:59,651 --> 01:41:02,740
You could just order as much as
you want or you can eat things.

1724
01:41:02,741 --> 01:41:06,340
Psychologically it seems a
lower the quality really.

1725
01:41:06,670 --> 01:41:09,940
All you can eat Sushi.
Oh yeah. But Brazilian

1726
01:41:10,100 --> 01:41:14,830
steakhouses. Oh, that's fantastic. Those
two. Haas Korea's, we have that card.

1727
01:41:15,620 --> 01:41:19,010
Yeah. Like green on one side of
red on the other. When it's red.

1728
01:41:19,011 --> 01:41:22,760
Do you want to take a break
when it's green? They just
common with new food. Yeah.

1729
01:41:22,761 --> 01:41:25,700
They both places like that in
Philly. After Eddie Bravo, uh,

1730
01:41:25,730 --> 01:41:30,710
fought and metamorris or has grappling
match and Metamorris we went to a Fogo de

1731
01:41:30,710 --> 01:41:32,340
Chao and uh,
near the Beverly Center.

1732
01:41:34,500 --> 01:41:35,870
Brian and I have eaten it about

1733
01:41:36,260 --> 01:41:40,080
most of them. Most of them across the
country. There's anyone in San Diego.

1734
01:41:40,630 --> 01:41:44,070
Yeah, I know. I noticed. I noticed when
I was down in American comedy company,

1735
01:41:44,071 --> 01:41:44,904
when we would show up

1736
01:41:45,030 --> 01:41:48,840
town and we found a Fogo, we'd go,
ah, we get alongside and we go there.

1737
01:41:49,020 --> 01:41:52,050
That's delicious. And Joey Diaz would
look at you like you're an asshole.

1738
01:41:52,051 --> 01:41:55,710
If you go anywhere near that salad bar,
why you fucking want that salad bar dog?

1739
01:41:56,190 --> 01:42:00,480
Listen, sit down here. He had no danger.
You're in no danger. Bring it over.

1740
01:42:00,481 --> 01:42:02,160
Bring it all. We've got,
what do we got when we got,

1741
01:42:02,290 --> 01:42:05,070
he started talking in Spanish
to the fucking guy. The skewers,

1742
01:42:05,460 --> 01:42:06,510
they speak Portuguese.

1743
01:42:06,750 --> 01:42:09,510
He's talking to them in Spanish
trying to find some middle ground.

1744
01:42:09,610 --> 01:42:13,930
I recently went and they, they hide that
Kanye now they, that guy's hard to find.

1745
01:42:14,340 --> 01:42:17,830
You ask it to different people and you
get so much chicken sausage and bacon

1746
01:42:17,831 --> 01:42:19,130
stuff and you're like,
just give me the Pecan.

1747
01:42:19,290 --> 01:42:21,230
I think it's a matter of
how many people are there.

1748
01:42:21,380 --> 01:42:24,070
Like some things like are more popular,
right?

1749
01:42:24,480 --> 01:42:26,460
Uh, last time we were there,
they kept coming with it.

1750
01:42:26,461 --> 01:42:30,930
They had the big Kanya and the garlic
beef or be is like top sirloin.

1751
01:42:30,960 --> 01:42:34,410
What they do is they have like a,
an open fire. It's like a wood fire.

1752
01:42:34,411 --> 01:42:37,770
It's like real and they have these skewers
that they lean over the fire and the

1753
01:42:37,771 --> 01:42:40,860
skewer spin around and when
when they deem that it's ready,

1754
01:42:40,861 --> 01:42:42,030
then they bring it over your table,

1755
01:42:42,031 --> 01:42:46,320
slice pieces off the outside and then
they put it right back on the five salted.

1756
01:42:46,380 --> 01:42:46,681
Yeah,

1757
01:42:46,681 --> 01:42:50,210
the result it and put like I have a
basting thing if they do and so this is a

1758
01:42:50,480 --> 01:42:54,420
big piece of meat and they put it over
this fire and they just slowly cooked the

1759
01:42:54,421 --> 01:42:57,840
outside and then they put it back in
and slowly cooked the outside and I'm

1760
01:42:57,841 --> 01:43:00,450
getting hungry. There's a place near
here you want to eat after this?

1761
01:43:00,940 --> 01:43:05,080
Yeah. Fuck yeah. By the way,
Joe, our green mountain grill,

1762
01:43:05,081 --> 01:43:08,080
they have a new app now that you could
use the app to tell when your food's done.

1763
01:43:08,890 --> 01:43:10,750
They sent me the info.
I got to hook it up though.

1764
01:43:10,751 --> 01:43:13,690
You got to get a guy to come to your
house though and plug it in sensor thing

1765
01:43:13,691 --> 01:43:17,040
and yeah, it's not easy to do, but that
green mountain grills ma. Awesome. Yeah.

1766
01:43:17,090 --> 01:43:20,110
That's a pellet grill. If you don't
know what that is, it's a smoker.

1767
01:43:20,420 --> 01:43:23,620
It's smokes your, your
food like, like an oven.

1768
01:43:23,740 --> 01:43:28,270
That's the hot smoke of uh, this burning
firewood or this burning a hardwood.

1769
01:43:28,480 --> 01:43:30,910
They take hardwood.
And when you like,

1770
01:43:30,911 --> 01:43:33,220
say if you bought a table like
this table's made out of Oak,

1771
01:43:33,580 --> 01:43:37,570
well someone who cut this would you
leave a lot of saw dust and they buy the

1772
01:43:37,571 --> 01:43:41,380
hardwood saw dust and they
compress it into these pellets,

1773
01:43:41,650 --> 01:43:44,110
which with the natural sugars of the wood,
there's no additives.

1774
01:43:44,111 --> 01:43:47,560
It's just the wood itself. And then
you pour these pellets. It looks like,

1775
01:43:47,561 --> 01:43:50,560
almost like you ever seen that pine
kitty litter to use that stuff.

1776
01:43:51,020 --> 01:43:51,853
The best stuff

1777
01:43:52,160 --> 01:43:53,690
cuts the smell back the most.
Yeah.

1778
01:43:54,050 --> 01:43:57,620
But you take these pellets and
you pour it into this like hopper.

1779
01:43:57,621 --> 01:44:01,250
It's like this box close the lid on
it and he set the temperature and it

1780
01:44:01,251 --> 01:44:05,330
automatically keeps the fire
going. It's like this got this, um,

1781
01:44:05,900 --> 01:44:06,561
what is it called?

1782
01:44:06,561 --> 01:44:11,060
An element that that heats it up and
it spins it and like this gear and the

1783
01:44:11,120 --> 01:44:15,740
pellets automatically get introduced and
the fire has the exact right amount of

1784
01:44:15,741 --> 01:44:18,110
temperature and you can keep it at like,
you know,

1785
01:44:18,111 --> 01:44:23,090
like for two 50 or three 50 or trying
to cook something. Whoa. So amazing.

1786
01:44:23,600 --> 01:44:26,540
It's so easy. Like I used to have another
kind of smoker used to have to add,

1787
01:44:26,541 --> 01:44:28,220
would do it all the time.
It was a nightmare.

1788
01:44:28,460 --> 01:44:31,160
This thing does it all itself and
it tastes like all those guys.

1789
01:44:31,161 --> 01:44:33,290
Like have you ever watched
those barbecue competitions?

1790
01:44:33,630 --> 01:44:36,140
You ever watch those things and like
the food channel, a lot of those guys,

1791
01:44:36,141 --> 01:44:40,280
they use those pellet grills now. The
pellet grills are like a big, a big deal.

1792
01:44:40,370 --> 01:44:41,920
Hey, you put the meat on, you know,

1793
01:44:42,020 --> 01:44:45,340
earlier in the afternoon and it's
just falling off the bone. No,

1794
01:44:45,350 --> 01:44:50,300
it's pretty bad ass. It's pretty bad ass.
I'm a big fan. I've got a big, big fan.

1795
01:44:50,301 --> 01:44:54,710
Tom, I ran right back at you. Joe's big
fan. I love cooking men. Cooking is fun.

1796
01:44:55,190 --> 01:45:00,110
It's especially fun when you're cooking
something that you killed yourself.

1797
01:45:00,620 --> 01:45:03,230
When you cut it up yourself and
you slap that bitch on the grill.

1798
01:45:03,860 --> 01:45:07,130
It's very exciting though. Never
killed anything. What'd you be willing?

1799
01:45:07,520 --> 01:45:10,400
I'm thinking about doing a hunting show.
This is the idea of the hunting show.

1800
01:45:10,401 --> 01:45:14,240
The idea of the hunting show is I go
out with people that have never been

1801
01:45:14,241 --> 01:45:18,260
hunting before, whether
it's comedians like Hannibal
Burress, he said he would go,

1802
01:45:18,610 --> 01:45:20,990
um,
a lot of guys are interested in going,

1803
01:45:21,020 --> 01:45:24,060
I would go to the flash star
hotel closest to where goes,

1804
01:45:24,180 --> 01:45:26,150
it goes go home and he wouldn't hunt.
No.

1805
01:45:26,390 --> 01:45:29,990
What if we took you out in a pickup truck
and you can just roll down the window

1806
01:45:29,991 --> 01:45:34,610
and fire it out the window? Yes,
definitely. What'd you do that?

1807
01:45:35,060 --> 01:45:38,330
That's my style.
You can do that in some places in Texas,

1808
01:45:38,360 --> 01:45:42,620
there's a ranch that Aubrey hunted at
where you literally shoot your rifle from

1809
01:45:42,621 --> 01:45:46,640
the front seat of the truck. Oh, I love
the, the fucking truck has no windshield.

1810
01:45:46,850 --> 01:45:49,460
So you drive around on this truck.
You know,

1811
01:45:49,461 --> 01:45:51,770
I don't know if it's like a jeep
or if it's actual pickup truck.

1812
01:45:51,771 --> 01:45:52,850
They knocked the windshield out,

1813
01:45:53,060 --> 01:45:56,930
but you drive around in this truck and
then they get close to these herds of

1814
01:45:56,931 --> 01:46:01,820
animals and then a fucking set your
rifle up right there through the window.

1815
01:46:01,850 --> 01:46:04,880
Boom. He shoot it. Then you get
out of the truck, you get it,

1816
01:46:05,210 --> 01:46:08,420
you take a photo with it. Oh, I got to
get out of the truck. You don't have to.

1817
01:46:08,480 --> 01:46:11,810
Okay, I'll bring it to you. I'm still in.
I'll bring it to you and you can wave.

1818
01:46:11,870 --> 01:46:13,790
Instead of taking a picture
with the animal you kill,

1819
01:46:13,791 --> 01:46:18,290
you just wave from the window. This is
dumb. This is dom to deer and you uh,

1820
01:46:18,350 --> 01:46:19,760
and then they take care
of everything else.

1821
01:46:19,761 --> 01:46:22,940
It's like the laziest way to hunt ever.
I would like that.

1822
01:46:25,960 --> 01:46:28,070
What I was,
we were in the mid Sophie,

1823
01:46:28,071 --> 01:46:31,640
we're in Hawaii and she was
snorkeling and I finished. She's only,

1824
01:46:31,641 --> 01:46:32,710
you are so fucking lazy.

1825
01:46:32,730 --> 01:46:35,390
Could find a way to snorkel
without even going under water.

1826
01:46:35,660 --> 01:46:37,610
I got one of those riffs
that you see through,

1827
01:46:38,700 --> 01:46:41,950
put my head on the snorkeled with a raft.

1828
01:46:43,630 --> 01:46:47,840
Oh, that's hilarious. I snorkeled for the
first time. Last time I was in Hawaii.

1829
01:46:47,841 --> 01:46:52,030
It was awesome. It's really
fun. Yeah. Swimming around
a reef. We're around a reef.

1830
01:46:52,031 --> 01:46:55,110
You're seeing all these fish moving
around in their little world. You know,

1831
01:46:55,111 --> 01:46:57,120
it was a little, uh, I
stepped on a CNN enemy though.

1832
01:46:57,121 --> 01:46:59,700
This fucker went right
into my foot. Really? Yeah.

1833
01:46:59,701 --> 01:47:03,240
They had a poor vinegar all over my foot.
You're supposed to do it.

1834
01:47:03,241 --> 01:47:05,840
If you've got to go near a reef,
like reefs are really sure.

1835
01:47:06,120 --> 01:47:10,920
He's supposed to do it with those a scuba
shoes because that was his barefoot.

1836
01:47:11,520 --> 01:47:12,353
But you,
uh,

1837
01:47:12,630 --> 01:47:16,980
you step down in the wrong spot and he
see an enemy like black spines went deep

1838
01:47:16,981 --> 01:47:19,140
into my foot. Oh yeah. Fuck me up.

1839
01:47:19,220 --> 01:47:21,100
I never go in the ocean without shoes on.

1840
01:47:21,110 --> 01:47:24,520
I just don't want to step on anything
gross. Like what? Condoms dead.

1841
01:47:24,710 --> 01:47:28,280
I stepped on dead. Jellyfish wants I'm,
it's just disgusting. And just, you know,

1842
01:47:28,281 --> 01:47:29,420
there's a lot of great stuff

1843
01:47:30,030 --> 01:47:34,510
she can fuck you up. Especially
Australia. Oh yeah. If you were to,

1844
01:47:34,511 --> 01:47:36,630
uh, Australia, there's um,

1845
01:47:37,170 --> 01:47:39,690
certain species of jellyfish
that kill people every year.

1846
01:47:39,770 --> 01:47:43,250
Yeah. I was just there a
couple months ago in Perth.

1847
01:47:43,940 --> 01:47:48,770
They have the helicopters going
over, you know, to spot the sharks.

1848
01:47:49,140 --> 01:47:52,970
They have that in Adelaide to really,
yeah. Cause they have, well they see them,

1849
01:47:53,510 --> 01:47:57,830
they warn people. Fuck that big
white, great white sharks. Yeah.

1850
01:47:58,010 --> 01:47:59,870
Yeah. That's a, that's a scary spot.

1851
01:48:00,110 --> 01:48:02,900
Apparently the most scary spot
for sharks in South Africa.

1852
01:48:04,180 --> 01:48:06,230
Australia is pretty bad. Is it van? Yeah.

1853
01:48:07,190 --> 01:48:10,730
That's also a place where a lot of people
surf too, right? Yeah. Did you ever surf?

1854
01:48:11,330 --> 01:48:16,190
Yeah. Really observed you surf,
but you, what was it like?

1855
01:48:17,700 --> 01:48:20,950
I was a pretty good athlete then. I
was, I got up a couple times, you know,

1856
01:48:20,951 --> 01:48:23,890
I did it a few times.
It's the thing about it,

1857
01:48:23,891 --> 01:48:27,010
you have to be a strong swimmer to really
get out there, to have them enjoy it.

1858
01:48:27,490 --> 01:48:30,760
Can't just like go 20 feet and
expect to ride something in.

1859
01:48:30,860 --> 01:48:34,150
You got it. Right. And you've got to climb
on it at just the right time to write.

1860
01:48:34,151 --> 01:48:37,700
Yeah, it's probably difficult.
It's, yeah, it's very difficult.

1861
01:48:37,950 --> 01:48:41,590
A place in Abu Dhabi,
I think it's Abu Dhabi or Dubai.

1862
01:48:41,650 --> 01:48:45,650
I've seen that they created an
indoor surfing. That's pretty wild.

1863
01:48:46,100 --> 01:48:49,010
It's ridiculous.
So we're most ridiculous thing ever.

1864
01:48:49,011 --> 01:48:52,790
Like isn't the whole idea is that you're
out there in the ocean with nature and

1865
01:48:52,791 --> 01:48:55,940
these guys will learn in the middle of
the does it, we're in a pool, in a mall.

1866
01:48:55,941 --> 01:48:57,080
Sometimes.
You've got to settle.

1867
01:48:59,310 --> 01:49:03,860
Brennan did comedy there back in, was
it Neil that you used to say? He did.

1868
01:49:05,030 --> 01:49:06,890
He tries. I'm kidding. No, he does.

1869
01:49:09,170 --> 01:49:11,990
Eddie have just had a Kickstarter.
He created his own. Um,

1870
01:49:12,380 --> 01:49:15,590
he created his own like
mobile podcast van,

1871
01:49:15,980 --> 01:49:18,500
like a van to go drive
around and do podcasts.

1872
01:49:18,501 --> 01:49:20,000
We talked about doing that on the podcast,

1873
01:49:20,001 --> 01:49:22,350
like getting a stream
one of those streamers,

1874
01:49:22,370 --> 01:49:26,420
whether it's called streamline
streamline's those silver ones. Yeah,

1875
01:49:26,510 --> 01:49:29,540
they'll silver things. Is that
called streamline? Yeah. Why?

1876
01:49:29,541 --> 01:49:33,230
I feel like it's called something else.
Streamline trailer. It's the silver one.

1877
01:49:33,440 --> 01:49:37,910
Yeah. Well that thing, the cool
looking retro looking one Gulf Stream.

1878
01:49:38,000 --> 01:49:39,620
Jimmy Buffet had one stream.

1879
01:49:41,220 --> 01:49:42,660
I was actually thinking about recently.

1880
01:49:42,661 --> 01:49:46,080
You just sell it because I have my second
card and selling it and try to and get

1881
01:49:46,081 --> 01:49:47,740
one of those and we've
death squad into that.

1882
01:49:48,490 --> 01:49:49,600
It's not a bad idea dude.

1883
01:49:49,840 --> 01:49:54,010
I thought about doing it too and like
that we could do them like on the road.

1884
01:49:54,160 --> 01:49:57,460
You could do it like you show up an hour
early for a Gig, do a Gig, you know,

1885
01:49:57,461 --> 01:50:01,340
doing the parking lot. But the fun, the
friendship flashed on the dust squad.

1886
01:50:01,990 --> 01:50:06,700
There was no one knows. No one
initiation fees is two on your backstage.

1887
01:50:07,270 --> 01:50:11,890
Lower back. The lower back
two dolphins game. Why were
you like to come? But there,

1888
01:50:14,290 --> 01:50:15,880
yeah, this one, this is,

1889
01:50:16,060 --> 01:50:20,050
there's a company that makes like a high
end version of these things where the

1890
01:50:20,051 --> 01:50:23,790
inside of it is like air stream. There it
is. I know you fucked it up. Streamline.

1891
01:50:23,791 --> 01:50:26,950
What'd I say? Streamline. Yup.
But there is a streamline,

1892
01:50:27,250 --> 01:50:30,430
see this is a streamline
trailer. Uh, so there's some,

1893
01:50:30,431 --> 01:50:34,800
some of them are streamlined. They just
ripped off the air stream game. Yeah,

1894
01:50:34,810 --> 01:50:36,640
look at that.
It makes it look that sexy thing.

1895
01:50:36,730 --> 01:50:38,830
How much are these fucking expensive?

1896
01:50:39,610 --> 01:50:44,610
They're not cheap because they're really
made well be says there's a place up in

1897
01:50:45,970 --> 01:50:50,150
big Sur where you will you rent them?
They have a,

1898
01:50:50,180 --> 01:50:52,570
they have them set up on this
property and that's how he camp.

1899
01:50:52,571 --> 01:50:55,030
They have like a like a
little grill out there.

1900
01:50:55,031 --> 01:50:58,470
Like Dunkin was up there for like a
week. He loved it. He said big surfaces.

1901
01:50:58,480 --> 01:51:00,220
Favorite place on the planet.
It's beautiful.

1902
01:51:00,280 --> 01:51:04,780
I know there's one in Joshua tree where
a lot of la comics all they rent out a

1903
01:51:04,781 --> 01:51:05,471
trailer.
They have,

1904
01:51:05,471 --> 01:51:09,160
I went to [inaudible] where they had
this big circle of trailers in each one's

1905
01:51:09,161 --> 01:51:10,510
decorated like a different,

1906
01:51:10,690 --> 01:51:15,690
like the 70s you know the retro on the
Star Trek one you have any interest in

1907
01:51:15,971 --> 01:51:18,640
doing like going to burning man?
No.

1908
01:51:19,030 --> 01:51:23,740
Next year we should podcasts from
burning man. If we're in a trailer, yes,

1909
01:51:23,741 --> 01:51:26,960
but if we, oh yeah dude, we're going
to be a trail. That's what I mean.

1910
01:51:27,460 --> 01:51:29,770
I will go there if there's a trailer,
but it's burning man.

1911
01:51:29,860 --> 01:51:34,120
It's a ridiculous festival out in the
middle of the desert where everyone gets

1912
01:51:34,121 --> 01:51:38,140
together and they all like dance
around and do drugs. They don't shower.

1913
01:51:38,141 --> 01:51:39,490
It's an excuse to be stinky.

1914
01:51:39,810 --> 01:51:44,320
It's like it's a like a
psychedelic sort of a festival.

1915
01:51:44,590 --> 01:51:47,500
And these people, they all get
together. Look at this one Brian.

1916
01:51:47,501 --> 01:51:50,350
They have one that's like a truck.
They have a,

1917
01:51:50,920 --> 01:51:53,380
they have like a coach and
you could drive it around.

1918
01:51:53,381 --> 01:51:57,880
They call them interstate Ext.
So look at this. Oh Wow. Yeah.

1919
01:51:58,060 --> 01:52:02,380
So you could drive it. So you'd have like
your, your kitty cat on the side of it.

1920
01:52:02,410 --> 01:52:05,920
It gets someone to paint it or get
one of those uh, uh, wrap. Yeah.

1921
01:52:06,610 --> 01:52:09,010
And you take one of these
things around if you develop,

1922
01:52:09,011 --> 01:52:13,950
like if you really developed a
plan and like set forth like a,

1923
01:52:13,960 --> 01:52:18,640
uh, like a, a real like legitimate
plan to get one of these things.

1924
01:52:18,860 --> 01:52:20,560
You could do it in a couple of years.
Here's,

1925
01:52:20,561 --> 01:52:23,350
will Smith at burning man this
year on segways. Will Smith,

1926
01:52:23,351 --> 01:52:27,040
was there no for real
or is it a Smith Mask?

1927
01:52:27,640 --> 01:52:32,110
Which ones will Smith just wonder here.
Other dancing together.

1928
01:52:32,111 --> 01:52:35,090
What are they doing? Filming something.
They're getting jiggy with it.

1929
01:52:35,670 --> 01:52:39,910
They're getting genuine. Um, desk Mckenna.

1930
01:52:40,300 --> 01:52:43,480
He are not a dentist. We can have Graham
Hancock rather. He goes there every year.

1931
01:52:44,020 --> 01:52:46,460
I think you just got back it,
it just happened, right? Yeah,

1932
01:52:46,461 --> 01:52:49,790
it was last week and actually the first
day or two was canceled because of rain.

1933
01:52:49,810 --> 01:52:53,030
The, they have the crane and it closed,
flooded. All the roads going into it.

1934
01:52:53,210 --> 01:52:55,100
They even have like these
really small ones. Look,

1935
01:52:55,101 --> 01:52:57,710
they just attach to the back of your
trailer and then you can just leave it at

1936
01:52:57,711 --> 01:53:02,300
home if he went to, yeah, there's
some good ones. Um, w rain.

1937
01:53:02,301 --> 01:53:06,140
Where is it? Uh, uh, Arizona.

1938
01:53:06,620 --> 01:53:09,710
Where does Bernie man type place?
I think it's one of the thing.

1939
01:53:09,730 --> 01:53:13,730
It was California. And what did I think
it was California done many death valley,

1940
01:53:14,050 --> 01:53:18,720
California and the land to go to burning
man thumb. No desire at all. Jews.

1941
01:53:18,730 --> 01:53:20,750
We're doing a podcast
down there next year.

1942
01:53:21,080 --> 01:53:25,460
Would you be willing to stay for one day?
We'll lemme you when you come out.

1943
01:53:25,470 --> 01:53:29,170
You do the pockets with you out.
You're in Arizona. That's great.

1944
01:53:29,210 --> 01:53:34,130
Heard it here first in to the
broadcast. We drink, we eat well.

1945
01:53:34,131 --> 01:53:37,990
We've been talking about taking
this bitch mobile, doing some uh,

1946
01:53:38,120 --> 01:53:41,630
podcasts in New York, doing some
podcasts and other places where I can't,

1947
01:53:41,631 --> 01:53:44,570
you know, I get, can't get certain guests
to come here, so I want to go to them.

1948
01:53:45,350 --> 01:53:49,520
I like it here. Do you like
it? Here is a good spot. Yeah.
Very good. But you, you're,

1949
01:53:49,580 --> 01:53:51,570
you, you know, still with
the Werewolf starting out.

1950
01:53:51,590 --> 01:53:55,340
They're trapped by the pool table.
I gotta fuck toy miss up.

1951
01:53:55,400 --> 01:53:59,290
You're not paying attention. She is black.
Rock desert is worked. Burning man is,

1952
01:53:59,490 --> 01:54:03,730
where's that? Arizona. Nevada. Hmm.

1953
01:54:04,130 --> 01:54:06,350
Didn't they try to enforce
laws there this year?

1954
01:54:06,440 --> 01:54:09,230
The same like the catch people with
drugs are gonna arrest him and some shit.

1955
01:54:09,500 --> 01:54:13,940
Check your car for weapons.
All that. Leave people alone.
Fucking drugs. She's, hey,

1956
01:54:14,270 --> 01:54:17,880
he's got a, they got to make money somehow
by my era. That's exactly what it is.

1957
01:54:17,881 --> 01:54:22,280
I keep all those people in uniform. Who
gives a fuck? What do people even care?

1958
01:54:22,700 --> 01:54:26,740
Old People, conservatives, people
who want tax dollar business,

1959
01:54:27,060 --> 01:54:28,580
that's not their business.
That's the point.

1960
01:54:28,581 --> 01:54:32,510
That's what makes young people so angry.
It's almost like they know that they're,

1961
01:54:32,570 --> 01:54:33,331
they're controlled.

1962
01:54:33,331 --> 01:54:37,760
They have is fleeting and they know that
there's kind of a new age in the air

1963
01:54:37,910 --> 01:54:40,970
like what was going on in
the 60s is going on now,

1964
01:54:40,971 --> 01:54:45,080
but to a much larger extent and to
a much more broad extent, like the,

1965
01:54:45,560 --> 01:54:48,110
the understanding of how
corrupt our system is.

1966
01:54:48,111 --> 01:54:51,710
The understanding of like how
flaw did all is piece together.

1967
01:54:51,711 --> 01:54:54,080
Even by the people that are in it.
They're involved in it.

1968
01:54:54,110 --> 01:54:56,900
It's like they're all admitting the
whole thing is a disaster. Well,

1969
01:54:56,901 --> 01:55:00,320
there's the financial system, the
political system, and then on top of that,

1970
01:55:00,590 --> 01:55:04,400
like marijuana is becoming legal. Whether
people like it or not. It's spreading.

1971
01:55:04,401 --> 01:55:08,750
Colorado was making so much
fucking tax money. It's incredible.

1972
01:55:08,990 --> 01:55:12,260
It's also happening in Washington state.
Unprecedented number two,

1973
01:55:12,261 --> 01:55:13,160
Superbowl teams.

1974
01:55:13,161 --> 01:55:16,970
We're both from states that it was legal
cars highest fuck come up with good

1975
01:55:16,971 --> 01:55:20,000
ideas. Excellent strategies.
I, Joe, I don't even, you know,

1976
01:55:20,090 --> 01:55:24,590
I smoked pot four times in my life
and I always go for number five. No,

1977
01:55:24,790 --> 01:55:25,623
it's one hit.

1978
01:55:25,790 --> 01:55:29,000
Just a little bit of one hit the switch
to all these stores that will be a

1979
01:55:29,001 --> 01:55:32,250
heroin addict and a week and make you
feel good. It's not a gateway drug.

1980
01:55:32,360 --> 01:55:35,270
Just the Partnership for drug
free America trying to trick you.

1981
01:55:35,300 --> 01:55:38,920
I'm totally convinced that
it's not a gateway drug, by
the way. I'm totally good.

1982
01:55:38,921 --> 01:55:42,620
I know. I don't know anybody from that
went from pot to heroin. Well, you could,

1983
01:55:42,740 --> 01:55:45,600
but you could also go from
toothpaste to heroin. You know,

1984
01:55:45,601 --> 01:55:49,290
it doesn't mean that it's a gateway. Like
everybody drinks water. Who does heroin,

1985
01:55:49,291 --> 01:55:52,380
by the way, Karen would, should
be legal, by the way. I do too.

1986
01:55:52,800 --> 01:55:54,090
I think everything should be legal,

1987
01:55:54,120 --> 01:55:57,060
but I think there should be consequences
to selling people things that are bad

1988
01:55:57,061 --> 01:56:01,410
for them. So I think that if
you, if heroin is legal, but
if you're selling heroin,

1989
01:56:01,680 --> 01:56:04,000
I think that should be massive
consequences. I think you should be.

1990
01:56:04,001 --> 01:56:06,840
If people die of overdoses,
I think you should be held responsible.

1991
01:56:06,990 --> 01:56:09,780
Just like you should be held
responsible. Say if you come up with, uh,

1992
01:56:10,230 --> 01:56:12,840
you come up with some new medication,
you know, he caught up with,

1993
01:56:12,870 --> 01:56:15,510
if you're a pharmaceutical company and
you come up with a new medication and

1994
01:56:15,511 --> 01:56:16,380
deals with Migraines,

1995
01:56:16,381 --> 01:56:19,470
but it also winds up killing a
certain percentage of people.

1996
01:56:19,610 --> 01:56:22,350
They should be held
financially responsible. You
should be able to be sued.

1997
01:56:22,590 --> 01:56:26,220
He's got a joint for you.
He's the devil. Look at him.

1998
01:56:26,460 --> 01:56:28,410
That's what the devil looks like.
Everybody thinks the devil looks mean.

1999
01:56:28,780 --> 01:56:31,890
Likes cuddly devil.
Looks like a big sweetie.

2000
01:56:33,670 --> 01:56:36,630
No, no, no, no, no, no, no. He
doesn't stop being a pusher.

2001
01:56:36,960 --> 01:56:38,430
What were we talking
about before the devil?

2002
01:56:39,180 --> 01:56:41,970
Just the legality of drugs
and how ridiculous. Uh,

2003
01:56:42,010 --> 01:56:45,630
and you were saying that people who
sell, excuse me, this is the point,

2004
01:56:45,760 --> 01:56:47,620
sells drugs to people she'll be held.

2005
01:56:47,621 --> 01:56:52,050
That's why it's being responsible for
the repercussions of what happens to

2006
01:56:52,051 --> 01:56:54,570
people when they use it.
If people die of heroin overdoses,

2007
01:56:54,930 --> 01:56:56,940
if that's possible from
something that you sell,

2008
01:56:57,330 --> 01:57:01,020
you should be held financially responsible
up to a point because you know,

2009
01:57:01,021 --> 01:57:04,340
you could die from Shell, from
salt, you could die like get me a,

2010
01:57:04,610 --> 01:57:07,170
if you'd give a Guy Bacon
every day for breakfast,

2011
01:57:07,860 --> 01:57:11,500
it's going to be dangerous if
you eat nuts, not banded bank.

2012
01:57:11,510 --> 01:57:14,880
And believe it or not is not bad for
you. Bacon. Yep. Not Bad for you.

2013
01:57:14,881 --> 01:57:17,130
It's delicious thing I've ever had
in my life. It's not bad for you.

2014
01:57:17,131 --> 01:57:20,340
You know what's bad for you being
fat enough that bacon is bad for you.

2015
01:57:20,670 --> 01:57:23,570
That's what's valued to say it like that.
I'm not saying any foul.

2016
01:57:23,590 --> 01:57:25,350
You said it with like a,
you like go,

2017
01:57:25,370 --> 01:57:30,120
you projected it to you because you
like the audience of my delivery.

2018
01:57:30,150 --> 01:57:33,870
But I mean you,
I'm at Ralphie may I met someone larger.

2019
01:57:34,620 --> 01:57:37,260
That's not me. I love Ralphie
by the way. This is just jokes.

2020
01:57:37,440 --> 01:57:41,010
They're talking about me. I
right here. Yeah, he's right
there. Um, but when you're,

2021
01:57:41,040 --> 01:57:43,740
when you're so fat that
Bacon's doing un well,

2022
01:57:43,741 --> 01:57:45,810
some people have naturally
high cholesterol too.

2023
01:57:45,930 --> 01:57:47,610
That's another thing to
take into consideration.

2024
01:57:47,640 --> 01:57:49,980
There's some people that are genetically
have high cholesterol and they have to

2025
01:57:49,981 --> 01:57:51,170
watch it. Yeah. And they have,

2026
01:57:51,240 --> 01:57:53,880
you also have to balance out your good
cholesterol and your bad cholesterol.

2027
01:57:53,881 --> 01:57:57,990
A lot of people think the cholesterol is
all bad. You know there's Ldl and Hdl,

2028
01:57:57,991 --> 01:58:00,840
there's, there's good cholesterol
and then this cholesterol that is,

2029
01:58:00,950 --> 01:58:03,040
it's not not good for you but is good.

2030
01:58:03,450 --> 01:58:05,930
But if you have like low
cholesterol like pho,

2031
01:58:05,980 --> 01:58:09,240
there's certain cholesterol that's
actually good for brain function. Yeah,

2032
01:58:10,110 --> 01:58:14,820
I think I've just heard that though.
Uh,

2033
01:58:14,880 --> 01:58:16,830
cholesterol,

2034
01:58:17,520 --> 01:58:22,020
the hipster coalesced good. I'm
going to write cholesterol. Good.

2035
01:58:22,200 --> 01:58:27,090
Okay. Good versus bad cholesterol from
the American heart association. Okay,

2036
01:58:27,091 --> 01:58:31,920
so this is not bullshit at all.
HDL and LDL triglycerides.

2037
01:58:31,921 --> 01:58:33,870
What's the difference in Ldl?

2038
01:58:34,530 --> 01:58:38,160
Cholesterol is considered
the bad cholesterol because
it contributes to plaque,

2039
01:58:38,580 --> 01:58:42,130
which is a thick, hard deposit
that can clog arteries and make

2040
01:58:42,130 --> 01:58:45,210
them less flexible. So are still our, our,

2041
01:58:45,400 --> 01:58:47,500
our theory or old sclerosis.

2042
01:58:47,740 --> 01:58:52,360
Arterial Sclerosis is what comes from
the bad cholesterol and those narrowed

2043
01:58:52,361 --> 01:58:54,340
arteries or give people heart attacks.

2044
01:58:54,400 --> 01:58:59,110
HDL cholesterol is considered good
cholesterol because it helps remove LDL

2045
01:58:59,111 --> 01:59:03,790
cholesterol from the arteries, which is
interesting. So expert Cresta does that,

2046
01:59:04,620 --> 01:59:08,200
is that that a a pill? Yeah,
and Lipitor too, right?

2047
01:59:08,290 --> 01:59:09,520
It's that same same kind of stuff.

2048
01:59:09,970 --> 01:59:14,620
Experts believe that HDL
acts as a scavenger carrying
LDL cholesterol away from

2049
01:59:14,621 --> 01:59:18,100
the arteries and back to the liver where
it is broken down and passed from the

2050
01:59:18,101 --> 01:59:18,880
body.

2051
01:59:18,880 --> 01:59:23,140
One fourth to one third of blood
cholesterol is carried by HDL.

2052
01:59:23,320 --> 01:59:27,430
A healthy level of HDL cholesterol may
also protect against heart attack and

2053
01:59:27,431 --> 01:59:32,431
stroke while low levels of HDL cholesterol
have been shown to increase the

2054
01:59:32,661 --> 01:59:34,720
reduced risk of heart attacks.
Um,

2055
01:59:35,020 --> 01:59:39,160
Dr. Mark Gordon explained this to me
when I had my, um, my blood work done.

2056
01:59:39,550 --> 01:59:43,330
And when he was telling me is that
there's a lot of issues like where people

2057
01:59:43,331 --> 01:59:46,270
think they have high cholesterol
and then, you know, they say,

2058
01:59:46,271 --> 01:59:49,360
oh my cholesterol count is this. And
he'd say, okay, what does that mean?

2059
01:59:49,390 --> 01:59:53,050
Is it your HDL or Ldl?
And then most people don't even know,

2060
01:59:53,380 --> 01:59:54,670
like they used to not know.

2061
01:59:54,940 --> 01:59:58,780
And if you're dealing with a physician
that doesn't understand the difference

2062
01:59:58,781 --> 02:00:01,000
between the two, if they're not
an expert in it, like thinking,

2063
02:00:01,070 --> 02:00:05,440
give you bad advice and get you on
medication that you don't even need.

2064
02:00:05,800 --> 02:00:08,750
Like you just said, you have
high HDL, you have high, uh,

2065
02:00:08,950 --> 02:00:12,130
you have high healthy
cholesterol, you can, you know,

2066
02:00:12,140 --> 02:00:16,090
you really want to balance
allegedly coming from me.

2067
02:00:16,210 --> 02:00:18,700
I'm a little doctor to
steal one of your bits.

2068
02:00:19,420 --> 02:00:21,730
I'm not a doctor that I had no idea.

2069
02:00:24,070 --> 02:00:28,690
But um, so my point is big
and not bad. Not Bad for you.

2070
02:00:28,750 --> 02:00:33,100
Did he went to burning man this year and
changed as supposedly changed his life

2071
02:00:33,101 --> 02:00:36,920
forever. Like look at his picture
of him at burning man and then like,

2072
02:00:36,970 --> 02:00:37,930
look at this.

2073
02:00:39,470 --> 02:00:41,960
He was at burning man with
his own little umbrella.

2074
02:00:41,990 --> 02:00:44,210
You didn't even have a guy
holding it for him. That's crazy.

2075
02:00:44,450 --> 02:00:47,940
ADDS up pink. Who's that? PDT. Oh,

2076
02:00:49,060 --> 02:00:53,320
and supposedly it changed his life once.
CanNot explain.

2077
02:00:53,321 --> 02:00:55,510
I'll never be the same.
Same

2078
02:00:56,470 --> 02:00:59,290
Bacon is loaded with fats,
but they're good fats.

2079
02:00:59,320 --> 02:01:01,770
The fats and bacon or
about 50% monounsaturated.

2080
02:01:01,810 --> 02:01:04,660
And a large part of those is a lyric acid.

2081
02:01:04,990 --> 02:01:08,530
This is the same fatty acid that olive
oil is praise for it and is generally

2082
02:01:08,531 --> 02:01:12,250
considered heart-healthy.
40% of it is saturated fat,

2083
02:01:12,251 --> 02:01:14,350
accompanied by a decent
amount of cholesterol.

2084
02:01:14,530 --> 02:01:18,610
But we now know that the saturated fat
isn't harmful and cholesterol in the diet

2085
02:01:18,611 --> 02:01:22,750
doesn't affect cholesterol and the blood.
Fascinating.

2086
02:01:23,600 --> 02:01:28,090
But that's the greatest thing was I had
all day to Bacon, Bacon and jogging.

2087
02:01:28,190 --> 02:01:31,570
Go get some Bacon said when two of
them together. Do you, so you, you,

2088
02:01:31,571 --> 02:01:34,870
you're going to the gym though, right? You
work out? Yeah. Where do you work out? No,

2089
02:01:34,871 --> 02:01:36,490
don't tell people they'll fuck it.
Stock you.

2090
02:01:37,010 --> 02:01:39,920
They'll stock in a steal your underwear,
breaking your locker and shit in it.

2091
02:01:40,130 --> 02:01:44,040
You know the this place shirt.
Correct. Oh, that place. Okay. Yeah.

2092
02:01:44,600 --> 02:01:48,560
So you get a good workout there.
Yeah, I've got an, excuse me.

2093
02:01:48,561 --> 02:01:52,070
I got a torn rotator cuff,
partially torn.

2094
02:01:52,820 --> 02:01:55,340
So it's been tough to lift the weights
and then you get flabby right away at

2095
02:01:55,341 --> 02:01:59,180
this age. It's funny, I
was in Perth and I opened,

2096
02:01:59,190 --> 02:02:03,680
the elevator was closed during a fire
alarm about but pulled this thing.

2097
02:02:03,920 --> 02:02:07,460
Whoa. Unbelievable timing. I'm in Chicago,

2098
02:02:07,490 --> 02:02:11,600
fucking totally in pain. The guy comes
up to me after he goes, you know,

2099
02:02:11,601 --> 02:02:15,140
I'm an orthopedic surgeon.
Uh, I got 20 doctors here.

2100
02:02:15,350 --> 02:02:19,310
A couple of us were talking about you,
you have a partially torn rotator cuff.

2101
02:02:20,150 --> 02:02:23,290
I said, uh, why you can tell by looking at
me. He goes, absolutely. He said he could.

2102
02:02:23,300 --> 02:02:26,780
He could see the way he was raised in my
hand. He says, come in tomorrow, Pro Bono,

2103
02:02:26,781 --> 02:02:30,340
I'll take care of you. Wow. I says, you
know, I got insurance. It's not, no,

2104
02:02:30,341 --> 02:02:32,360
you made me laugh for 25 years.
I'll take care of it.

2105
02:02:32,830 --> 02:02:34,520
So I think it's going to be me,
him and a needle.

2106
02:02:34,521 --> 02:02:38,450
It's like a whole group of doctors and you
know, he's trying to be funny. He goes,

2107
02:02:38,451 --> 02:02:42,260
is that the hand you come with? Oh, he
said, is that the hand you jerk off?

2108
02:02:42,261 --> 02:02:45,220
And I said, well, I jerk with
that hand, but I offered the sand

2109
02:02:46,850 --> 02:02:51,320
and uh, anyway, so I'm up there and he
gives me a needle in the shoulder. I said,

2110
02:02:51,321 --> 02:02:54,440
well, why am I paying my hip
hurts too because I look at that,

2111
02:02:54,470 --> 02:02:57,290
the x Ray that give me another
fucking shot. It was great.

2112
02:02:57,720 --> 02:03:01,770
So the parsley turned rotator
cuff, does it need surgery? No, no,

2113
02:03:01,830 --> 02:03:02,820
it's 85%.

2114
02:03:02,850 --> 02:03:06,930
I mean it's only 15% tour
so it just needs exercise.

2115
02:03:07,140 --> 02:03:10,260
So you have to stabilize it. Is
that what it is? They have to,

2116
02:03:10,760 --> 02:03:12,750
you have to always be moving.

2117
02:03:12,751 --> 02:03:15,510
It does it fuck with you right
now if you're moving around like,

2118
02:03:15,760 --> 02:03:19,020
like sometimes like this,
like moving and like that.

2119
02:03:19,290 --> 02:03:22,290
I can't let that goes like this.
I can't do,

2120
02:03:22,500 --> 02:03:24,840
I've never had like real
soldier shoulder problems,

2121
02:03:24,841 --> 02:03:29,010
but I had some of their recently
where I shot too many arrows. I uh,

2122
02:03:29,011 --> 02:03:34,011
I got overzealous with my bow and now I
have a 90 pound bow and an 80 pound bow

2123
02:03:34,800 --> 02:03:39,330
and I shot the 90 pound ball like 150
times a day. It was just way too much.

2124
02:03:39,331 --> 02:03:41,340
My shoulder just got worn out and it was,

2125
02:03:41,341 --> 02:03:45,690
it was hurting for like a couple of
months. But thankfully it wasn't torn.

2126
02:03:45,920 --> 02:03:50,430
It was just like tendonitis, like all
very mild form of irritated tendons.

2127
02:03:50,520 --> 02:03:54,810
But now it's 100%. Took like
five weeks, five or six weeks.

2128
02:03:54,840 --> 02:03:56,360
I never had done anything like it.
I've loves,

2129
02:03:56,430 --> 02:04:00,660
luckily it was my right hand cause
I'm lefthanded so yeah, it's not good.

2130
02:04:00,690 --> 02:04:04,650
Shoulders are a weird joint cause
shoulders move. Very calculated,

2131
02:04:04,651 --> 02:04:06,810
very strange ways as
opposed to like knees,

2132
02:04:06,811 --> 02:04:11,130
which just been like a hinge and a
shoulder goes bad. It's bad for fighters.

2133
02:04:11,131 --> 02:04:14,110
It's a real issue for fighters.
Like um,

2134
02:04:14,130 --> 02:04:18,120
they have to get surgery and they don't
fight for a year. It's a long time out.

2135
02:04:18,121 --> 02:04:22,620
It's a career ender for baseball
players per pitchers. Yeah. Yeah.

2136
02:04:22,621 --> 02:04:26,390
I would imagine you have to be really
smooth fucking weapon that arm back.

2137
02:04:26,530 --> 02:04:28,830
Like it's,
it's really,

2138
02:04:28,831 --> 02:04:31,380
can they fix that now or it's
still not that they could fix it,

2139
02:04:31,530 --> 02:04:34,160
but now it's not a career ender anymore.
Well it can be. It's all going to,

2140
02:04:34,170 --> 02:04:38,130
how still can bail, you know,
just like the elbow. Wow man,

2141
02:04:38,210 --> 02:04:38,790
that's it.

2142
02:04:38,790 --> 02:04:42,750
It's weird when you find out there's
parts of your body did they can't fix.

2143
02:04:42,930 --> 02:04:45,780
Like one of the things that I've found
out when I started to have back issues as

2144
02:04:45,781 --> 02:04:47,430
they want to start cutting things,

2145
02:04:47,700 --> 02:04:50,670
they want to start getting in there
and fucking Yank and shit out.

2146
02:04:50,970 --> 02:04:54,330
But there's certain things
that they just can't fix.

2147
02:04:54,630 --> 02:04:57,330
Like they've started to
give you artificial discs.

2148
02:04:57,480 --> 02:05:01,650
They started giving those to people
like they have, um, they have spacers.

2149
02:05:01,651 --> 02:05:04,770
Were these a plastic things that they
screw in, in the place where you're,

2150
02:05:04,771 --> 02:05:06,270
you're Mushi disc used to be.

2151
02:05:06,630 --> 02:05:11,430
And then now they have these titanium
rotating disks that they put in your neck

2152
02:05:11,940 --> 02:05:14,790
and yeah, pretty crazy.
And some people, um,

2153
02:05:14,880 --> 02:05:18,480
in other countries they do that and
they don't do it yet. In America,

2154
02:05:18,481 --> 02:05:19,380
I don't believe so.

2155
02:05:19,381 --> 02:05:22,830
Some people who get injured in America
go to other countries to get your fucking

2156
02:05:22,831 --> 02:05:24,660
neck cut open. Like Germany does it. And

2157
02:05:25,280 --> 02:05:29,780
England does it to put a little fake
disc and it moves around screws and shit.

2158
02:05:29,781 --> 02:05:33,500
Which is how you get hit,
like what your break and like Bo Jackson,

2159
02:05:33,680 --> 02:05:37,610
remember Bo Jackson, great baseball
and football player. He had a knee,

2160
02:05:37,640 --> 02:05:40,770
a hip injury. It was the end
of his career. That was it.

2161
02:05:40,771 --> 02:05:43,040
It's just playing baseball for
a little while and tried. Yeah,

2162
02:05:43,041 --> 02:05:45,290
he was the first one that ever
played with an artificial hip,

2163
02:05:45,291 --> 02:05:47,870
but I mean it was never the same.
He had so much power.

2164
02:05:47,871 --> 02:05:52,130
He was able to hit home runs without even
over whatever and torrent turning over.

2165
02:05:52,330 --> 02:05:56,060
You didn't even totally rotate what
halfway rotate and he would get pissed.

2166
02:05:56,061 --> 02:05:59,420
He would break a bat on his leg and
how fucking hard that is. The dude,

2167
02:05:59,630 --> 02:06:01,310
he's a super athlete.
That guy,

2168
02:06:01,311 --> 02:06:03,860
Bo Jackson could have done anything
if he wanted to go into MMA,

2169
02:06:03,861 --> 02:06:05,030
he would have been all checked guy.

2170
02:06:05,350 --> 02:06:08,600
He was a such a super athlete and
they said he barely worked out.

2171
02:06:08,810 --> 02:06:10,550
Barely lift awake. Yeah, just,

2172
02:06:10,580 --> 02:06:14,420
just was naturally super strong
and just a great athlete will.

2173
02:06:14,421 --> 02:06:17,450
Chamberlain was supposed to be like
that cause I'm from Philly and we always

2174
02:06:17,840 --> 02:06:21,980
read about him. Oh, imagine,
look at the size of the guy.
But he was the fastest to,

2175
02:06:22,070 --> 02:06:24,260
that's the fastest guy on his
team. He wasn't, you know,

2176
02:06:24,930 --> 02:06:27,500
well you remember when Jordan was in
his prime and he would literally fly

2177
02:06:27,501 --> 02:06:28,350
through the air.
Yeah.

2178
02:06:28,790 --> 02:06:31,100
He would fly like nobody had
seen anything like that before.

2179
02:06:31,130 --> 02:06:34,550
Julia serving sort of the
sky hook. Right, right. No,

2180
02:06:34,560 --> 02:06:37,400
that was the hook was a Abdul Jabbar.
Oh.

2181
02:06:37,430 --> 02:06:39,970
But Julia serving was the
first one that did the, uh,

2182
02:06:40,010 --> 02:06:44,270
from the foul line and the dunk contest.
Whoa.

2183
02:06:44,300 --> 02:06:45,370
Really from the foul line,

2184
02:06:45,371 --> 02:06:50,090
a dunk so crazy that someone can do so
fucking big Joe that he could palm a

2185
02:06:50,091 --> 02:06:54,350
record album to imagine that.
Like you could be putting my God,

2186
02:06:55,940 --> 02:06:59,990
that's insane. That's insane. Yeah.

2187
02:06:59,991 --> 02:07:04,280
Imagine if Michael Jordan got into MMA
was just flying across the fucking Kaeser

2188
02:07:04,310 --> 02:07:08,960
punching people live
because there's levels of athleticism,

2189
02:07:08,961 --> 02:07:13,820
you know, it's like this, the average
guy and then the z above average guy,

2190
02:07:13,821 --> 02:07:17,120
and there's the guy who was above the
above average guy and then there's a super

2191
02:07:17,121 --> 02:07:20,480
athlete and then there's a Michael
Jordan who makes the super athletes,

2192
02:07:20,990 --> 02:07:25,910
like he's on another level. If Ron
James does same thing, right? Yeah.

2193
02:07:25,911 --> 02:07:29,960
You know, an old buddy of mine is
Charles Barkley. Uh, you know, he is,

2194
02:07:31,300 --> 02:07:35,220
he, uh, was telling me, he goes,
look at me. He says, I got my,

2195
02:07:35,320 --> 02:07:39,550
my size of 32 inches. He goes, I got a
definite advantage. He goes, look at that.

2196
02:07:39,551 --> 02:07:44,410
A little white guy, Scotty Brooks
could barely touch the net. Yeah.

2197
02:07:44,411 --> 02:07:47,530
There's certain physical advantages
that are undeniable. Oh yeah.

2198
02:07:47,680 --> 02:07:50,210
The idea that all men are created
equal is fucking preposterous.

2199
02:07:50,330 --> 02:07:54,280
You could say that the human soul is equal
or that you should be equal under the

2200
02:07:54,281 --> 02:07:58,000
eyes of the law. Yeah. But now
they're not an equal. Yeah.

2201
02:07:58,001 --> 02:08:00,730
You could take all the steroids you want.
You never have been able to do it.

2202
02:08:00,731 --> 02:08:04,090
Michael Jordan did naturally and
you can't practice being six 10.

2203
02:08:05,140 --> 02:08:07,880
That's also a weird thing,
isn't it? Where like, uh,

2204
02:08:08,060 --> 02:08:11,620
where people talk about like performance
enhancing drugs should be illegal.

2205
02:08:11,710 --> 02:08:13,720
They definitely should.
But if they are,

2206
02:08:13,840 --> 02:08:16,570
that means like the super athletes
are always going to have an advantage.

2207
02:08:16,810 --> 02:08:17,950
Just a natural,

2208
02:08:18,010 --> 02:08:23,010
undeniable advantage in speed and
power and the ability to move well,

2209
02:08:23,051 --> 02:08:26,620
racial differences make a difference.
I mean Jimmy, the Greek over here,

2210
02:08:26,860 --> 02:08:29,830
no they do, but I mean physically,
you know, it's incredible.

2211
02:08:30,670 --> 02:08:34,100
There has not been a
weight cornerback in the,

2212
02:08:34,370 --> 02:08:38,410
in the NFL that I remember
in the last 2025 years.

2213
02:08:39,280 --> 02:08:43,270
What position? That's discrimination.
That's why they're quicker. No,

2214
02:08:43,360 --> 02:08:47,330
they're trying to keep the
white men down. Dom, you know,

2215
02:08:48,100 --> 02:08:51,160
you come on this podcast,
he started spreading black propaganda.

2216
02:08:51,340 --> 02:08:56,230
It's the same thing every time.
But I hate all minorities. Joe.

2217
02:08:56,950 --> 02:08:59,950
Even white people. Yes. When
why people would come minority.

2218
02:08:59,951 --> 02:09:02,740
Maybe everybody relaxed.
Also minority talk.

2219
02:09:04,600 --> 02:09:05,020
It's sort of,

2220
02:09:05,020 --> 02:09:08,920
it's funny the thing he said about race
because on a serious level these guys

2221
02:09:08,950 --> 02:09:13,060
can't say anything like that's what's
so funny about Barkley cause he's black.

2222
02:09:13,061 --> 02:09:16,270
He can say stuff, right. He says
that, I know you can't say it,

2223
02:09:16,300 --> 02:09:19,870
but I'm going to say it.
Whatever it is, you know? Yeah.

2224
02:09:19,871 --> 02:09:24,871
There's a lot of fucking like things
that they used to say like on a regular

2225
02:09:25,361 --> 02:09:26,680
basis now they can't even say.

2226
02:09:26,681 --> 02:09:29,750
So they've had to adjust over
the last just few years. Yeah.

2227
02:09:30,340 --> 02:09:33,700
Well everything's so politically
correct now and now it's Sam,

2228
02:09:33,760 --> 02:09:37,960
that Guy Sam got picked up by the cowboys
to get got it came out of it and say

2229
02:09:37,961 --> 02:09:40,870
that he was getting, yeah, so
here, that leads with a team so,

2230
02:09:41,110 --> 02:09:44,320
well I heard that he was,
according to Jamie, that he's a,

2231
02:09:44,360 --> 02:09:46,780
the reason why they picked him up is
that the cowboy is the guy who runs the

2232
02:09:46,781 --> 02:09:51,330
cowboys is into publicity. Oh yeah,
totally. That's exactly it. Yeah. He's,

2233
02:09:51,640 --> 02:09:53,500
he's a moneymaking machine.
This guy,

2234
02:09:53,740 --> 02:09:57,670
the cowboys had been a 500 team
for the last 10 years. Probably.

2235
02:09:57,910 --> 02:10:01,330
They haven't won a Superbowl
in 20 years and the the most,

2236
02:10:01,660 --> 02:10:05,530
they're most valuable per franchise
in America. That's incredible. Yeah.

2237
02:10:06,010 --> 02:10:09,670
That's hard to believe. They
have to make any sense. Thanks.

2238
02:10:09,780 --> 02:10:13,660
Three point $2 billion. Why?
How come they don't have to,

2239
02:10:13,661 --> 02:10:17,200
when they don't have to win
because of publicity. First of all,

2240
02:10:17,201 --> 02:10:20,890
they're called America's team. You know
who named them that? The owner themselves.

2241
02:10:20,891 --> 02:10:24,850
Yeah, the owner. It's that guy named
t text gram, but America's team,

2242
02:10:25,060 --> 02:10:29,470
they got the star and the glitter and the
fucking weight is a Dallas cowboys and

2243
02:10:29,471 --> 02:10:34,100
the dude's names tex.
Yeah, he went tech Graham.

2244
02:10:34,190 --> 02:10:37,130
He wins. Yeah. But I
mean he's, he's dead now.

2245
02:10:37,131 --> 02:10:39,050
But he was the one that
created that image.

2246
02:10:39,380 --> 02:10:41,480
Whatever happened in that show
used to do for comedy central.

2247
02:10:41,481 --> 02:10:44,710
That was a funny show. You used to
do like a show with football players.

2248
02:10:44,720 --> 02:10:49,340
It was called off sides. Well, what
happened to it was the timing was bad.

2249
02:10:49,341 --> 02:10:51,710
You know, if comedy central
was as big as they are now,

2250
02:10:51,711 --> 02:10:52,940
they could have afforded more.

2251
02:10:53,180 --> 02:10:57,530
But NFL films is so fucking
expensive that they just had to lift.

2252
02:10:57,531 --> 02:11:01,910
And we had good ratings, but it just
wasn't, you know, they, they're,

2253
02:11:02,030 --> 02:11:04,130
they're footage costs
so much for us to get,

2254
02:11:04,370 --> 02:11:08,870
and I had so much fun with the players
because they knew I wasn't a journalist,

2255
02:11:09,260 --> 02:11:13,750
so they were like, I get, uh,
you know, Brett Farve is okay.

2256
02:11:13,751 --> 02:11:17,240
So Reggie White was their
star, their team, and he said,

2257
02:11:17,270 --> 02:11:19,700
he recognized me because man,
I saw you on Oprah. And I said,

2258
02:11:19,701 --> 02:11:22,070
I can't picture you sitting
there with a Kleenex box going,

2259
02:11:22,250 --> 02:11:25,700
I can't believe he's two sisters never
met before. They were 21, you know,

2260
02:11:27,180 --> 02:11:31,070
you know. So, uh, Reggie one
that to do with thing with me,

2261
02:11:31,071 --> 02:11:35,750
he liked doing impressions so far of
was was the second biggest star on the

2262
02:11:35,751 --> 02:11:37,970
team. And he comes up to me, he
goes, what are you doing? I said,

2263
02:11:37,971 --> 02:11:41,240
we're doing it football show for comedy
central. You want to do it? He says, well,

2264
02:11:41,241 --> 02:11:44,190
what do I gotta do? I said, just, you
know, fuck you, fuck around. You know,

2265
02:11:44,420 --> 02:11:47,930
I'm not a journalist, but would just have
fun so I could see him. He was a little,

2266
02:11:48,020 --> 02:11:51,010
had some trepidations about it. I thought
I was going to maybe lay into him.

2267
02:11:51,650 --> 02:11:54,350
I said them so I'm fucking
this girl in the ass, right?

2268
02:11:54,440 --> 02:11:57,530
I mean I'm holding it down and fucked
him. Banging a no rubber, no nothing.

2269
02:11:57,531 --> 02:12:01,820
I aint no pussy. And he starts
laughing. He goes, are you
allowed to say this? I go,

2270
02:12:01,940 --> 02:12:04,830
we're not on satellite.
Then I'm just trying to make you laugh.

2271
02:12:05,090 --> 02:12:10,020
And then he got loose and then it,
then we had a great interview. When w

2272
02:12:10,380 --> 02:12:13,710
when you did that, like was the NFL
in the same position that's at now?

2273
02:12:13,711 --> 02:12:16,690
Was it just as popular still?
Nfls never dwindled, right?

2274
02:12:16,770 --> 02:12:18,840
No, it's gotten bigger and
bigger but it's bigger now.

2275
02:12:19,020 --> 02:12:21,090
It was the football is by far the most,

2276
02:12:21,840 --> 02:12:24,060
I mean I dunno about Nascar,

2277
02:12:24,150 --> 02:12:28,080
but the regular like athletic sports,
football is,

2278
02:12:28,560 --> 02:12:31,950
football is so fucking big, high school
football, college football. Know.

2279
02:12:32,550 --> 02:12:35,760
I think Nascar is the biggest
spectator sport, right, isn't it?

2280
02:12:36,540 --> 02:12:40,410
I think don't they have places like
boarded up 200,000 people or something

2281
02:12:40,411 --> 02:12:41,120
absurd?

2282
02:12:41,120 --> 02:12:42,890
Well, you know what
happens. Yeah, there's that.

2283
02:12:42,891 --> 02:12:45,320
But you know what also happens is
that like when you go down south,

2284
02:12:45,350 --> 02:12:47,120
everybody knows about Nascar.

2285
02:12:47,720 --> 02:12:50,920
I was on the radio once in Atlanta and
they just started talking to me about

2286
02:12:51,050 --> 02:12:55,490
going to Kyle all draw up and Neil
Day and this guy, I'm a home hand.

2287
02:12:55,550 --> 02:12:57,140
It did bring it up.
All these names.

2288
02:12:57,141 --> 02:13:02,030
I never even heard of this guy won
the Talladega wrong. I literally,

2289
02:13:02,120 --> 02:13:04,460
I go, so what are you talking about? And
they're like, we're talking about NASCAR.

2290
02:13:04,461 --> 02:13:08,990
You don't follow Nascar.
This guy does not follow Nascar.

2291
02:13:09,130 --> 02:13:13,250
Like it was so alien to them that I didn't
know who any of those guys where it's

2292
02:13:13,340 --> 02:13:17,450
heard about Dale Earnhardt. What about
Dale Earnhardt? So he's still doing it.

2293
02:13:17,451 --> 02:13:21,870
You know like you hear certain names
like escape from that world and

2294
02:13:22,000 --> 02:13:22,301
I mean,

2295
02:13:22,301 --> 02:13:26,020
I only know Tony Stewart because he was
the guy that accidentally apparently

2296
02:13:26,021 --> 02:13:29,740
killed that driver that got out of the
car. He said, yeah, that was fucked.

2297
02:13:29,970 --> 02:13:32,880
It was crazy. What the fuck was he
thinking to get? The driver got,

2298
02:13:32,881 --> 02:13:36,150
well Tony Stewart apparently clipped
him with his car and spun him out and he

2299
02:13:36,151 --> 02:13:40,680
was only 20 he's a hothead,
20 year old, you know. Jeez.

2300
02:13:41,040 --> 02:13:44,820
Amazing. Tony Stewart is going to race
again. It did. That's, that's nuts.

2301
02:13:44,821 --> 02:13:49,110
He raised again and when he came in
like 41st it came real slow, Huh?

2302
02:13:49,530 --> 02:13:51,870
Yeah. He can't be a dick
after won somebody over.

2303
02:13:52,420 --> 02:13:55,380
Imagine if you just fucking balls
to the wall clip and everybody now

2304
02:13:57,270 --> 02:14:00,950
or would it be just very safe driver
now he's like giving proper turn single

2305
02:14:00,951 --> 02:14:03,330
that he's like,
I'm going to the racetrack.

2306
02:14:04,610 --> 02:14:08,390
Is that a normal position for
him to be in 40th please? Oh no,

2307
02:14:08,400 --> 02:14:11,400
he's usually up there at the top. I
mean, I don't know that much about it,

2308
02:14:11,401 --> 02:14:15,270
but I bet he did try to take it slow.
Probably. It's probably a real mind.

2309
02:14:15,271 --> 02:14:18,190
Fuck man. I feel like
mom, it's like boom, boom.

2310
02:14:18,191 --> 02:14:21,680
May have seen the after he killed Duke.
Who? Kim, you know, like I, you know,

2311
02:14:21,870 --> 02:14:25,500
the guy should have been frightened but
Raymond was never the same after that.

2312
02:14:25,560 --> 02:14:30,510
No, no it wasn't. It's one
of those things, man, it's,
it's hard for guys. It's,

2313
02:14:30,560 --> 02:14:33,540
it's hard to also, you know, for a boxer,

2314
02:14:33,541 --> 02:14:37,870
you're dealing with your own
mortality too. You know, that's, uh,

2315
02:14:39,680 --> 02:14:43,860
that's, that's the fight that changed
fighting from 15 rounds to 12 did it,

2316
02:14:44,380 --> 02:14:46,590
he died in the 13th. I
believe. He, you know,

2317
02:14:46,591 --> 02:14:49,680
he had a bleeding on his brain
before he got hit. Got in the ring.

2318
02:14:50,040 --> 02:14:52,290
How do they know that? That's
what I read. I don't know.

2319
02:14:52,410 --> 02:14:55,680
They said that they had whatever,

2320
02:14:55,990 --> 02:14:59,310
that he shouldn't have been
fighting the guy, you know. Well,

2321
02:14:59,311 --> 02:15:01,770
I know that he was cutting
weight and that was also,

2322
02:15:01,771 --> 02:15:04,560
I think back when they would
weigh in the day of the fight.

2323
02:15:04,770 --> 02:15:09,690
But now they know more about
weight cutting. Cause man
senior was a lightweight.

2324
02:15:10,080 --> 02:15:14,130
So that was 135 pounds.
And I think that, uh,

2325
02:15:14,131 --> 02:15:16,830
I think that fight took place as
a lightweight fight. I believe.

2326
02:15:17,750 --> 02:15:21,180
Fought Livingstone bramble he found
a lot of great fighters. SARC whale.

2327
02:15:22,110 --> 02:15:25,230
He came to see me at the
Improv one night and uh,

2328
02:15:25,350 --> 02:15:27,600
we went out to talk and
his wife and his kid,

2329
02:15:27,601 --> 02:15:32,100
we're watching a show and some guy comes
up and it goes boom, boom and seen.

2330
02:15:32,101 --> 02:15:36,190
He goes, can I ask you something
when you hit me? Right. And,

2331
02:15:36,210 --> 02:15:39,980
and I said to the guy, I
said, look, you know, I said,

2332
02:15:40,090 --> 02:15:43,080
they can't hit you Moravians. Really
Nice Guy. Do you ever meet him?

2333
02:15:43,700 --> 02:15:48,330
I'm said hi to him. Real conversation
with them. You know, Youngstown, Ohio,

2334
02:15:48,331 --> 02:15:52,110
like real cool guy and did it
all for his father. Great Story.

2335
02:15:52,950 --> 02:15:56,940
And I said, look man, he can't hit you.
You know, like Raymond's like he's,

2336
02:15:57,130 --> 02:16:00,960
and they said, well, can I hit you
then to, to rape me? I said, no,

2337
02:16:00,961 --> 02:16:05,860
you can't fucking hate him. What are
you crazy kind of hit you when he said,

2338
02:16:06,090 --> 02:16:09,550
he said, I always wanted to see what like
a professional punch felt like, Oh God,

2339
02:16:10,080 --> 02:16:12,480
like the fuck I look,
I like to give them an amateur punch.

2340
02:16:12,630 --> 02:16:13,720
Well now he that dummy,

2341
02:16:13,721 --> 02:16:17,190
the guy's got a his fucking hands and
then put gloves on and then punch you.

2342
02:16:17,200 --> 02:16:21,720
Either you could break his hands course
with the forest that they hit. Yeah.

2343
02:16:21,721 --> 02:16:23,550
You could easily break your
hand on someone's forehead.

2344
02:16:24,070 --> 02:16:25,770
He's lucky he didn't say
it at the Vinny Corto.

2345
02:16:25,860 --> 02:16:27,940
Vinnie would have probably punched him.
Oh God.

2346
02:16:29,200 --> 02:16:33,070
I did a great thing of any one
time. Every tennis what? I Dunno,

2347
02:16:34,210 --> 02:16:35,680
I brought them up.
Okay.

2348
02:16:36,220 --> 02:16:41,000
We had this crazy fucking nut cocaine
head lived upstairs and they will fund to

2349
02:16:41,001 --> 02:16:42,460
doing this. Yeah, they would fuck.

2350
02:16:43,060 --> 02:16:46,690
And then you hear the shower and it was
like five in the morning and I stay up

2351
02:16:46,691 --> 02:16:48,690
late. But after a while, like I said,

2352
02:16:48,700 --> 02:16:52,510
too much gay turned the music down just
a little. That's all nice. You know,

2353
02:16:52,990 --> 02:16:57,190
next day Kim's window was broken in a car.
I knew he fucking did it.

2354
02:16:57,540 --> 02:17:00,820
So I go get Vinny. Vinny
looked like fucking, you know,

2355
02:17:00,970 --> 02:17:05,200
incredibly fucking gorilla.
Just cave man 100%.

2356
02:17:05,530 --> 02:17:09,550
And I get, I get a kick out of him. And
I liked the I personally, but, uh, he,

2357
02:17:09,551 --> 02:17:12,750
he did me a favor, come, we go up and
was like, good guy, bad guy thing.

2358
02:17:12,820 --> 02:17:17,050
And he kicked the door and the
kid goes, what? And I go, hey man,

2359
02:17:17,080 --> 02:17:21,190
I just want to ask. And he sees Vinny and
then he changed completely and he goes,

2360
02:17:21,220 --> 02:17:24,580
uh, you know, uh, uh, my cup,

2361
02:17:25,240 --> 02:17:29,710
I just wanted to tell you that somebody
broke a window. And as your neighbor,

2362
02:17:29,711 --> 02:17:31,930
I want to warn you that
there's somebody around here.

2363
02:17:31,931 --> 02:17:36,180
So just look out for yourself. And I'm
totally not really me. And Vinnie goes,

2364
02:17:36,220 --> 02:17:39,490
my fucking cousin, he goes, I
love him like a brother. He goes,

2365
02:17:39,491 --> 02:17:43,210
if anybody does fucks with dom,
I get these fucking headaches.

2366
02:17:43,450 --> 02:17:46,090
I don't even know what I'm doing. And
the kids go on and the guy goes, no, no,

2367
02:17:46,091 --> 02:17:50,740
no ma'am, I certainly didn't do it. I
go, holy fuck accused you of doing it.

2368
02:17:50,741 --> 02:17:55,140
Why would you say that? And,
and it goes, Vinny said,

2369
02:17:55,210 --> 02:17:58,870
I sleep on his couch and the afternoon,
make sure there's no fucking noise.

2370
02:17:58,871 --> 02:18:02,230
I'll go fucking great. And that was
it. You know, stop. The noise stopped.

2371
02:18:02,231 --> 02:18:05,160
Everything, stopped everything
that he'd see him at the gym.

2372
02:18:05,210 --> 02:18:09,640
See Vinny pressing 500 pounds at the gym.
Yeah. How you doing? How's your cousin?

2373
02:18:11,480 --> 02:18:13,760
That's a problem with
living in apartments. Yeah.

2374
02:18:14,300 --> 02:18:17,270
I had a guy that lived
below me that asked me not,

2375
02:18:17,300 --> 02:18:19,340
I had a pool table in my living room.

2376
02:18:19,430 --> 02:18:24,230
I bought this pool table us and I rented
this apartment specifically because it

2377
02:18:24,231 --> 02:18:27,890
had a place for the pool table. This is
the place that I lived in. Uh, when I,

2378
02:18:28,010 --> 02:18:31,400
when I had to stay in la though, the
first place I moved in North Hollywood,

2379
02:18:31,401 --> 02:18:34,730
he signed the lease. I signed the
lease and that's what made me stay.

2380
02:18:34,731 --> 02:18:37,070
And that's the reason why I got all
everything, News, radio, everything.

2381
02:18:37,280 --> 02:18:38,930
But I got this,
he was a,

2382
02:18:38,990 --> 02:18:42,660
it was a loft and it had this big
living room and I was like, I get doubt.

2383
02:18:42,680 --> 02:18:45,530
Like I measured it out. I can definitely
get a pool table in here. I'll take it.

2384
02:18:45,560 --> 02:18:48,470
I tell the guy this, the fucking
landlord is, shows it to me.

2385
02:18:48,470 --> 02:18:52,970
I'm looking for a place, that pool table,
he was below me, so, and Lord Yo, yeah,

2386
02:18:52,971 --> 02:18:55,640
that would the, not the landlord, but
the superintendent or whatever it is,

2387
02:18:55,641 --> 02:18:58,640
the guy, the guy who showed me the
place wasn't the actual landlord,

2388
02:18:58,641 --> 02:19:02,690
what do they call superintendents?
And so he's this,

2389
02:19:02,810 --> 02:19:07,250
this gay guys, really flamboyant
gay guy with his boyfriend. And um,

2390
02:19:07,500 --> 02:19:12,000
he co I, after I put the pool table in,
he knocks on the door and he goes, uh,

2391
02:19:12,050 --> 02:19:15,710
we're having an issue with
you walking around. I go,

2392
02:19:15,711 --> 02:19:18,590
you're having an issue with me
walking, just walking. He goes, well,

2393
02:19:18,591 --> 02:19:22,550
the floor creaks. I hear you walking.
What are you supposed to do? I go, okay,

2394
02:19:22,551 --> 02:19:24,380
well what do you want me
to do? And he goes, well,

2395
02:19:24,381 --> 02:19:27,860
between the hours of 5:00 PM and 10:00 PM,
you just not

2396
02:19:28,040 --> 02:19:31,220
not do that. I go, see, you're asking
me not to walk in the living room.

2397
02:19:31,221 --> 02:19:35,330
I'm not even doing anything. I'm just
walking. And he goes, he goes, oh.

2398
02:19:35,331 --> 02:19:39,620
So I see the game, we're gonna play here.
I go of the game, we're gonna play. I go,

2399
02:19:39,790 --> 02:19:39,920
well,

2400
02:19:39,920 --> 02:19:43,970
you're telling me is the structural
integrity of the apartment that you rented

2401
02:19:43,971 --> 02:19:47,480
me is not good enough for
me to actually be walking.

2402
02:19:47,540 --> 02:19:52,540
Just walking in the living room between
a five hour window every night when you

2403
02:19:52,731 --> 02:19:56,270
get home to when you go to bed, that's
what you want. He goes, yeah, I go,

2404
02:19:56,480 --> 02:20:01,370
is the fuck is this? I thought that's just
crazy. You can't say don't walk like a,

2405
02:20:01,371 --> 02:20:04,100
what if I just walk around my
pool table but I don't play.

2406
02:20:04,310 --> 02:20:08,680
I just walk in delivery. Like if I have
people over and they want to walk around,

2407
02:20:09,080 --> 02:20:12,860
look out someone. You just have to roll
or scoop. How about I put a Webcam.

2408
02:20:13,030 --> 02:20:16,310
You can tell when I'm walking and
when I'm just, when I'm playing pool,

2409
02:20:16,311 --> 02:20:20,740
so you can't get mad at me. That's
fucking apartments. That was just,

2410
02:20:20,860 --> 02:20:23,780
settlers kept playing pool.
Fuck him.

2411
02:20:23,840 --> 02:20:28,730
I had a guy wouldn't let me do the
treadmill. I, I told them, I said,

2412
02:20:28,731 --> 02:20:32,600
I'll do it anytime that you're
not there just to a compromise.

2413
02:20:32,601 --> 02:20:37,280
Anything I moved to for him,
killing me. You're killing my wife.

2414
02:20:38,570 --> 02:20:42,530
I said, who the fuck a buy in this
country? Go back to wherever it came, Tom,

2415
02:20:42,531 --> 02:20:45,530
I can't believe you took it there.
Well yeah. Well it's, I hated the guy.

2416
02:20:45,810 --> 02:20:47,540
Why did you have to have to
go to the immigrant place

2417
02:20:50,480 --> 02:20:53,540
punchy this country get the fuck back.

2418
02:20:53,870 --> 02:20:58,220
Who made guy,
the guy like when he said to me like,

2419
02:20:58,280 --> 02:21:01,350
oh I see the game we're playing.
I was like, okay, there's
no negotiating with you.

2420
02:21:01,360 --> 02:21:02,540
You're a ridiculous person.

2421
02:21:02,810 --> 02:21:07,100
I probably thought about it like probably
didn't play as much in but it takes

2422
02:21:07,101 --> 02:21:10,330
the fun out of it. They ain't got to
worry about some fucking nut downstairs.

2423
02:21:10,340 --> 02:21:15,140
It wasn't, it's the crazy
thing was it wasn't loud. It
wasn't like I moved around.

2424
02:21:15,141 --> 02:21:19,580
I heard
I didn't hear anything when I was walking.

2425
02:21:19,600 --> 02:21:20,570
I didn't hear shit.

2426
02:21:21,140 --> 02:21:25,280
I've been in that situation where you
hear every single footstep and they had to

2427
02:21:25,281 --> 02:21:28,970
end up putting carpet just to fix it.
Why had a carpet already?

2428
02:21:28,971 --> 02:21:31,990
It was already carpeted.
It's just a shitty building.

2429
02:21:31,991 --> 02:21:34,250
Cause the lady next door to me,
super nice lady,

2430
02:21:34,251 --> 02:21:38,570
but she would be on her phone and I to
hear every fucking word she said like I

2431
02:21:38,571 --> 02:21:42,740
was listening. I May. It was like,
there's no insulation in California.

2432
02:21:42,920 --> 02:21:46,040
That's the difference between apartments
on the east coast and department of the

2433
02:21:46,040 --> 02:21:46,760
West Coast is those,

2434
02:21:46,760 --> 02:21:50,540
those fiberglass insulation or the stuff
that they pump into the walls to keep

2435
02:21:50,541 --> 02:21:54,860
retain heat. They don't need that
out here, so you got wallboard Stud,

2436
02:21:55,050 --> 02:21:55,610
wallboard.

2437
02:21:55,610 --> 02:22:00,380
You basically got a fucking notebook
between you and some person who's talking

2438
02:22:00,381 --> 02:22:03,740
like some pretty intimate shit.
Every time she would get a phone call,

2439
02:22:03,741 --> 02:22:04,670
I would hear her voice,

2440
02:22:04,910 --> 02:22:08,420
her answering machine go on and I
would hear friends leave her messages.

2441
02:22:09,200 --> 02:22:11,960
That's not good. That was ridiculous.
I always think about that.

2442
02:22:11,961 --> 02:22:15,500
If I'm watching porn and they hear
it explore, turn it up really loud

2443
02:22:17,860 --> 02:22:22,430
when the guy comes,
I stopped caring.

2444
02:22:22,431 --> 02:22:22,901
There'd be there.

2445
02:22:22,901 --> 02:22:25,950
There is this too many times where I'm
just masturbating my and we look over,

2446
02:22:25,951 --> 02:22:26,280
notice

2447
02:22:26,280 --> 02:22:29,120
my windows openers to people
fencing in my backyard. I'm like,

2448
02:22:29,121 --> 02:22:31,710
oh you guys fencing? Yeah.
They just fence all day.

2449
02:22:31,740 --> 02:22:33,540
Who fences and your
name would be neighbors?

2450
02:22:33,570 --> 02:22:37,060
My neighbors dress up as pirates
and golf people and plants.

2451
02:22:38,390 --> 02:22:41,610
Burbank, man. Fucking
white people in Burbank.

2452
02:22:41,640 --> 02:22:44,610
They're fencing in your backyard.
They make their own costumes though.

2453
02:22:44,611 --> 02:22:48,780
It's pretty bad ass. But they do.
Yeah, they're mean, but very glamorous.

2454
02:22:49,030 --> 02:22:52,950
Like they're kings and stuff,
but pirates. What? I don't know.

2455
02:22:54,120 --> 02:22:57,000
So do they do like a part
of a festival or something?

2456
02:22:57,001 --> 02:23:00,390
I think they must work at
universal or something. Oh,

2457
02:23:00,391 --> 02:23:03,470
so they're practicing their trade maybe.
Hmm.

2458
02:23:03,810 --> 02:23:07,420
But they also have those sewing things
on like are those like things where you

2459
02:23:07,421 --> 02:23:10,590
so on in their windows,
like when you walk by there,

2460
02:23:10,591 --> 02:23:12,670
just like it looked like people
were just standing there. Oh,

2461
02:23:12,671 --> 02:23:16,950
the mannequins like yeah, those
snowing. Yeah. That's wow.

2462
02:23:17,580 --> 02:23:19,450
I guess they bake a lot of clothes.
Yeah.

2463
02:23:20,020 --> 02:23:21,870
When are you going to play
dress up and make your own shit?

2464
02:23:21,871 --> 02:23:24,180
It's probably more satisfying.
It's probably what we were talking about.

2465
02:23:24,240 --> 02:23:25,890
Eating the food that you kill.

2466
02:23:26,520 --> 02:23:30,210
Extra satisfying when you're out there
at fucking comic con Alpha that you

2467
02:23:30,211 --> 02:23:34,510
created yourself. We were in
Sacramento this past weekend. I did a,

2468
02:23:34,511 --> 02:23:37,470
the punchline you have do the
punchline Sacramento go. Oh,

2469
02:23:37,500 --> 02:23:40,920
what a great fucking club.
Oh, I love it. Perfect club.

2470
02:23:41,220 --> 02:23:46,110
Perfect size bar in the back.
Low ceiling. Tight seated. Ah,

2471
02:23:46,290 --> 02:23:49,410
we had so much fun there
but a while we were in town,

2472
02:23:49,411 --> 02:23:53,070
it was there for the UFC and there
was some sort of an anime convention,

2473
02:23:53,460 --> 02:23:57,750
like some sort of address up.
Dork fest was hilarious.

2474
02:23:58,020 --> 02:24:02,310
Just what's up layer layer.
What is that? The convention.

2475
02:24:03,120 --> 02:24:07,350
What's layer? What is that?

2476
02:24:07,351 --> 02:24:11,370
The thing that I was watching
in Sacramento. How do you know?

2477
02:24:11,400 --> 02:24:14,760
Are you just making shit up? That's
not what they were doing. You're wrong.

2478
02:24:14,850 --> 02:24:18,300
100% they were dressing like anime
characters. You Fuck? He's just this.

2479
02:24:18,600 --> 02:24:21,770
Jamie's into it. He's like
Qt, prudential. Norman to who?

2480
02:24:21,771 --> 02:24:24,690
Both this but how about
renaissance, right? We're not
talking about renaissance.

2481
02:24:24,691 --> 02:24:29,160
Fair of Jamie Layer.

2482
02:24:29,161 --> 02:24:32,310
This must be it the fuck out of here.
There's 100 million of those things.

2483
02:24:33,000 --> 02:24:36,150
I love it though. It's cool
because dorks getting opportunity,

2484
02:24:36,330 --> 02:24:38,730
they get an opportunity to hang
out with other doors, get outside,

2485
02:24:38,731 --> 02:24:41,610
get a little vitamin D, renaissance
faire, any of these things? Well,

2486
02:24:41,611 --> 02:24:45,090
this is an anime thing because people
were dressed up like superheroes and some

2487
02:24:45,091 --> 02:24:46,560
people were dressed up like furries.

2488
02:24:46,860 --> 02:24:50,280
There was like a lot of weirdness going
on that came out of Japan, right? Furries,

2489
02:24:51,650 --> 02:24:56,650
uh, yeah. Enemies. Just pretty much
Japan animation in their style.

2490
02:24:58,400 --> 02:25:02,780
Do you ever perform in Japan, dom,
that your people know he's the Escobar?

2491
02:25:05,330 --> 02:25:09,990
It's not funny. It's a the Moo.

2492
02:25:09,991 --> 02:25:13,670
My eyes were opened. I knew you back in
the day. I got a picture of Joey Diaz.

2493
02:25:13,700 --> 02:25:15,290
I'm going to put on Instagram later today.

2494
02:25:15,530 --> 02:25:17,570
I got his headshot that
I found in my office,

2495
02:25:17,600 --> 02:25:22,100
so he used to have on the wall is from,
he was walking 220210220 pounds.

2496
02:25:22,840 --> 02:25:23,980
Crazy.
I can't believe it's the

2497
02:25:23,980 --> 02:25:28,570
same guy. We'll see ways is
three, depends on how high he is.

2498
02:25:28,571 --> 02:25:31,860
When you ask him
wasn't dog.

2499
02:25:32,320 --> 02:25:34,860
He used to go on stage and he would
talk on stage. He goes, listen dog,

2500
02:25:34,930 --> 02:25:38,890
I'm 45 years old. I got no time for this
bullshit. I'm 50 years old. I got no time.

2501
02:25:38,900 --> 02:25:41,980
And again, the same set, we'll give
you three or four different ages.

2502
02:25:42,430 --> 02:25:44,800
Went through the fat blob.
He's like, don't talk about it.

2503
02:25:44,820 --> 02:25:45,641
It's just my little thing.

2504
02:25:45,641 --> 02:25:49,520
It's just a little fat bomb thing that
he had to get removed from his like

2505
02:25:49,590 --> 02:25:54,240
shoulder head. So it was weird.
He told me, he just said,

2506
02:25:54,241 --> 02:25:58,030
I love that guy. I fucking love that
guy. Love him to death. He's so much fun.

2507
02:25:58,210 --> 02:26:02,180
There's no more fun guy to be around.
Like, like when you bring him to shows,

2508
02:26:02,230 --> 02:26:05,350
like everybody's funnier
to the show's funnier.

2509
02:26:05,350 --> 02:26:08,140
The comics on the show or funny
or you're funny, you're backstage.

2510
02:26:08,141 --> 02:26:11,920
Everybody is funnier. I love him
too. And where's the CO headline?

2511
02:26:11,921 --> 02:26:14,650
A couple of times. What a blessed, so
much fun. I told you what he said to me,

2512
02:26:14,651 --> 02:26:18,220
right? What? I said, Joe, I don't
care who goes on first or second,

2513
02:26:18,221 --> 02:26:20,110
whatever you want. It goes
dumber. Ever tell you what,

2514
02:26:21,220 --> 02:26:23,860
why don't you close the first
shows and I'll close the second.

2515
02:26:23,861 --> 02:26:27,940
So you don't have to follow a fucking
pig lake me and then you could do it and

2516
02:26:27,941 --> 02:26:30,270
then you can do it at the laugh
factor if you want. I said,

2517
02:26:30,280 --> 02:26:34,240
so you're not only do me a
favor, you threaten, you get
me spots and other clubs.

2518
02:26:35,390 --> 02:26:39,640
He said he's a great dude. He is.
His podcast is doing fantastic too.

2519
02:26:39,820 --> 02:26:42,850
And that's one of the things that I
really love about the Internet, that um,

2520
02:26:42,880 --> 02:26:45,970
you know, a guy like Joey
could be Joey. He would never,

2521
02:26:45,971 --> 02:26:50,290
no one would ever understand him unless
he saw him in the uncensored form,

2522
02:26:50,291 --> 02:26:54,900
like on this pilot and I never understand.
Or his podcast dose in that kid that

2523
02:26:56,420 --> 02:26:59,050
still does that. You'd give him
mushrooms yet it gives him stuff.

2524
02:26:59,051 --> 02:27:04,051
He doesn't tell him who Joey to what
kid is it little friend that always

2525
02:27:05,180 --> 02:27:09,140
hanging, what is his name?
Lee. Yeah, he doses him. Yeah.

2526
02:27:09,150 --> 02:27:12,310
It keeps those to them like fucking like
roofie in him while he's not fucking

2527
02:27:12,311 --> 02:27:14,890
him. I don't have a problem with
that. If you're around Joey. No,

2528
02:27:14,920 --> 02:27:18,340
not to eat any of the shit. He
toast Burke. Chrysler's Dad.

2529
02:27:18,341 --> 02:27:23,230
I know Keith Burke crisis dad edible weed,
and it bursts like,

2530
02:27:23,231 --> 02:27:26,790
what are you doing? And He's
like, his dad was like, oh,

2531
02:27:26,791 --> 02:27:29,090
I'm just eating some candy that
Joe gave. He goes, that's how I can

2532
02:27:34,990 --> 02:27:37,900
listen. Cock sucker. You
Dad's gotta live gotta live.

2533
02:27:39,710 --> 02:27:44,710
He's Tom Ziglar has a fucking hilarious
story about the same thing that I said

2534
02:27:45,101 --> 02:27:47,190
about getting high with Joey
on the plane where he's,

2535
02:27:47,191 --> 02:27:49,420
he just throwing down these Chiba Chews.

2536
02:27:50,110 --> 02:27:54,630
That's Joe Joey in the middle of a panic
attack, like eight another cheap shoes.

2537
02:27:57,970 --> 02:28:01,540
He doesn't give a fuck man. He goes deep.
He's one of the funniest people I know.

2538
02:28:01,780 --> 02:28:05,970
He's bad comedy store. Yeah, he said
that it's been a good challenge that,

2539
02:28:05,971 --> 02:28:09,250
that he forgot how, how that room
was. You know, when you're on stage,

2540
02:28:09,340 --> 02:28:11,110
well they don't know you that you don't,

2541
02:28:11,140 --> 02:28:13,780
they don't know your comment
there for Jelly. Yeah. Yeah.

2542
02:28:13,830 --> 02:28:15,610
It's a different kind of a group.
You know,

2543
02:28:15,611 --> 02:28:19,780
you've got to develop material that like,
you set it up differently.

2544
02:28:19,781 --> 02:28:23,040
You got to introduce it
differently because they're
not expecting you to be that

2545
02:28:23,050 --> 02:28:25,400
this raucous, crazy, you know,

2546
02:28:25,430 --> 02:28:29,210
giant Cuban guys done a ton of coke
in his life, you know what I mean?

2547
02:28:29,240 --> 02:28:32,060
They don't know what to what,
what he's doing.

2548
02:28:32,330 --> 02:28:35,360
They just see a guy on stage and then
they have to slowly but surely be

2549
02:28:35,361 --> 02:28:37,790
introduced to his ideas.
What's going on there,

2550
02:28:37,791 --> 02:28:41,000
whether it's they're trying to stop
people from smoking weed where at the

2551
02:28:41,001 --> 02:28:42,260
college.
Is that true?

2552
02:28:42,730 --> 02:28:45,810
There's a rumor that uh,
that, that might be true,

2553
02:28:47,220 --> 02:28:49,830
but not the management. Like, you
know, what are you going to stop,

2554
02:28:50,350 --> 02:28:53,200
go hide in the back?
That sounds like the dumbest idea ever.

2555
02:28:53,230 --> 02:28:56,170
That's like telling football players
and stopped doing steroids. Yeah.

2556
02:28:56,680 --> 02:29:00,970
That's so stupid. Yeah. What do
you think keyless, the comedy star,

2557
02:29:00,971 --> 02:29:02,530
what are you gonna do to
stop him from drinking too?

2558
02:29:02,590 --> 02:29:05,680
Well, it's just one person that wants
to do it and then he's not, I mean,

2559
02:29:05,710 --> 02:29:06,540
that's ridiculous.

2560
02:29:06,540 --> 02:29:11,200
He have power that one person.
No, I doubt it. I have no idea.

2561
02:29:11,740 --> 02:29:13,000
His name rhymes with Pauly shore.

2562
02:29:18,850 --> 02:29:21,290
I Dunno. I don't go there anymore. I'm
just talking about in my ass. Yeah,

2563
02:29:21,291 --> 02:29:26,170
that going to go now? I don't think
so. I can't. I talk to Scotty,

2564
02:29:26,171 --> 02:29:29,500
Scotty shores, my buddy, I talked to him
when I was down in San Diego. I was like,

2565
02:29:29,501 --> 02:29:32,590
just say I just too much of a
bad feeling about that place.

2566
02:29:32,620 --> 02:29:35,980
I love when you come in for breaking
balls. I love doing your show,

2567
02:29:36,010 --> 02:29:36,900
your show the laugh back.

2568
02:29:36,910 --> 02:29:41,020
See the laugh factory doesn't have any
negative feeling to me. Especially now,

2569
02:29:41,050 --> 02:29:43,890
you know. Now it seems like there's
like a whole new crew there.

2570
02:29:43,891 --> 02:29:46,630
It's a kind of a different, yeah,
different sort of a vibe there.

2571
02:29:47,130 --> 02:29:48,570
But you,
if you go to the comedy store ever,

2572
02:29:48,571 --> 02:29:51,530
especially everyone that you've met
through desk while like Justin Martindale,

2573
02:29:51,610 --> 02:29:55,890
Tony Jeremiah, they're just everywhere
now and there. It's all positive.

2574
02:29:55,891 --> 02:29:58,950
It's like a huge family and when
somebody from the outside comes in,

2575
02:29:59,190 --> 02:30:01,640
it's like a whole family
looking at that person. Yeah,

2576
02:30:01,650 --> 02:30:04,350
but the person that comes in doesn't
want you smoking weed and I'm going to

2577
02:30:04,351 --> 02:30:07,230
smoke weed. If I go to the comedy
store, we all do it. What if,

2578
02:30:07,270 --> 02:30:09,990
what if you get banned from smoking weed?
I have a license.

2579
02:30:10,780 --> 02:30:11,171
No,

2580
02:30:11,171 --> 02:30:14,560
you can't just can't say I
have a lifestyle that the
liquid smoke in your house.

2581
02:30:14,650 --> 02:30:17,920
Well you know we were upstairs
when we, when, when it's private.

2582
02:30:17,921 --> 02:30:21,100
Just the acts really let
you smoke inside upstairs.

2583
02:30:21,160 --> 02:30:24,490
Oh Hey this isn't blowing it down.
All those people get the show better

2584
02:30:26,190 --> 02:30:30,640
as glass nail in between. So
yeah, that's a great thing.

2585
02:30:30,980 --> 02:30:33,430
He's got it set up up there.
That's a sweet thing.

2586
02:30:33,520 --> 02:30:37,120
Other than when they're in between shows
like Friday and Saturday with the two

2587
02:30:37,121 --> 02:30:41,270
shows. It's, it's basically a
club for the acts. We can relax.

2588
02:30:41,620 --> 02:30:43,450
I don't mind going there. I, you know, I,

2589
02:30:43,451 --> 02:30:46,630
I like the laugh factor when I do it
with you. It's got a good vibe, you know?

2590
02:30:46,660 --> 02:30:49,360
Oh I love it. I love that
shit with you. Thanks.

2591
02:30:50,590 --> 02:30:53,260
I always fun with the interview.
Yeah.

2592
02:30:53,290 --> 02:30:56,290
If you ever seen breaking balls
with dom Irrera he does a show,

2593
02:30:56,410 --> 02:30:57,670
he fucks around with the audience,

2594
02:30:57,671 --> 02:31:01,870
does material that brings up a comic
and then fucks around with the comic

2595
02:31:01,890 --> 02:31:06,640
inbetween and then brings up the next
comic relief. Yeah, it's fun. It's fun.

2596
02:31:06,730 --> 02:31:11,200
It's fun because you know,
Don, you're, you're at your
best. Well I wouldn't say it.

2597
02:31:11,201 --> 02:31:15,140
You're at your best. You're always, I
mean, you're always funny on stage, but I,

2598
02:31:15,170 --> 02:31:18,380
I love the particular type of funny
when you just fucking around. That's,

2599
02:31:18,400 --> 02:31:20,070
that's what I liked.
Yeah. Like when we did

2600
02:31:20,070 --> 02:31:23,250
the, uh, kill Tony shared with the ice
house. Yeah. We were crying and lift. Oh,

2601
02:31:23,251 --> 02:31:27,570
so fun. It was so fun. That was,
that was really, really, really fun.

2602
02:31:27,600 --> 02:31:31,330
And for those comics to get a guy like
you fucking with them and you know,

2603
02:31:31,350 --> 02:31:33,600
talking about their material.
I mean, a lot of those guys,

2604
02:31:33,601 --> 02:31:36,300
it was the first time they ever
went onstage. That's amazing.

2605
02:31:36,390 --> 02:31:39,870
Imagine that the first time you ever go
on stage and you get a guy who's been

2606
02:31:39,871 --> 02:31:43,350
doing comedy forever, it's been
on HBO, a legend in comedy,

2607
02:31:43,351 --> 02:31:46,410
and he's critiquing your act. That's,
that's, he's busting your balls.

2608
02:31:46,411 --> 02:31:49,380
It's as good as you could ever hope for.
I mean that's a beautiful moment.

2609
02:31:49,560 --> 02:31:52,740
The idea killed Tony is a great idea.
That should be a comedy central show.

2610
02:31:53,590 --> 02:31:56,340
She's totally sell. That shit is
on the schedule. It's a great idea.

2611
02:31:56,820 --> 02:32:00,100
Comics do a minute, you know it's,

2612
02:32:00,190 --> 02:32:01,860
and it's especially fun.

2613
02:32:01,960 --> 02:32:05,400
We did it at the Ice House because the
ice house has such a good feeling to it

2614
02:32:05,450 --> 02:32:09,030
and then the room is perfect.
Yeah, this is totally rooms good.

2615
02:32:09,370 --> 02:32:12,630
Just like the belly room. Yeah, about
the same size amount of seats. Right.

2616
02:32:12,631 --> 02:32:14,430
Belly rooms, like a
hundred seats, 90 seats,

2617
02:32:14,700 --> 02:32:18,120
so it was that room with the Ice House
has an annex. They have a big room,

2618
02:32:18,210 --> 02:32:19,410
which is not a big room.
Anyway,

2619
02:32:19,411 --> 02:32:23,460
the big room was only like
190180190 something like that.

2620
02:32:23,790 --> 02:32:24,900
And then they have the smaller room,

2621
02:32:24,901 --> 02:32:28,770
which is only about 80 or
90 and it's fucking amazing.

2622
02:32:29,860 --> 02:32:30,820
Yeah.
I liked that main room.

2623
02:32:30,821 --> 02:32:33,640
I think that's my favorite room cause
that's barely ever used. It was,

2624
02:32:33,641 --> 02:32:36,570
and it used to be such a famous room.

2625
02:32:37,630 --> 02:32:41,670
Started there three, three
Saturday night shows out. Yeah.

2626
02:32:41,910 --> 02:32:45,640
But the main room late at night when
there's only like 10 people in the room,

2627
02:32:45,641 --> 02:32:46,700
like it's fucking sad.

2628
02:32:46,800 --> 02:32:50,010
Yeah, no, no. Unless it's like
Brody Stevens or something.

2629
02:32:51,240 --> 02:32:53,640
I prefer those where it's just him.

2630
02:32:53,870 --> 02:32:58,870
I was in the main room once back in
the Joey Diaz days with Joey Diaz had,

2631
02:32:58,980 --> 02:32:59,930
uh,
Jeff,

2632
02:33:00,170 --> 02:33:05,170
you know Jeff the piano man [inaudible]
he had Jeff play Ozzy Osborne and he got

2633
02:33:06,771 --> 02:33:11,480
on stage and took his shirt
off and he's singing war pigs.

2634
02:33:11,750 --> 02:33:14,510
He's singing at Joey
Diaz is singing on stage.

2635
02:33:14,750 --> 02:33:19,340
And it was fucking one of the greatest
things I've ever seen in my life because

2636
02:33:19,341 --> 02:33:23,630
he's completely committed to it. He
had no shirt on. And the audiences,

2637
02:33:24,320 --> 02:33:28,850
maybe there was for audience members
and the rest of the audience was,

2638
02:33:28,851 --> 02:33:30,980
all comics were all just hanging out.

2639
02:33:31,130 --> 02:33:34,490
And Joey deals is onstage and they're
fucking with the lights. No, it wasn't.

2640
02:33:34,580 --> 02:33:39,110
It wasn't Jeff. It was the other guy
who did the, the main room. Mike. Fuck,

2641
02:33:39,170 --> 02:33:42,590
is that his name? Mike. The guy with
the glasses? Yeah. Yes. Great Dude.

2642
02:33:42,670 --> 02:33:45,500
Who was in a band? Another guy. He
didn't have classes. He was in a band.

2643
02:33:45,710 --> 02:33:49,250
You remember that guy? I was like, what's
up dude? Hey Dude. Yeah, he's still there.

2644
02:33:49,460 --> 02:33:53,960
What's his name? Uh, Shit. Do
you know what I'm talking about?

2645
02:33:54,170 --> 02:33:55,090
I think I got the wrong guy.

2646
02:33:55,091 --> 02:33:58,430
I was talking about Mike who is the
manager of playing piano. No, no, no, no.

2647
02:33:58,431 --> 02:34:01,190
I know you're talking about the guy
who handled the sound and the shit.

2648
02:34:02,040 --> 02:34:05,680
Now it's not Jeb, Danny,
Danny, Danny, Danny, Danny.

2649
02:34:06,060 --> 02:34:09,890
Danny is playing a war.
Pigs, you know, and uh,

2650
02:34:09,891 --> 02:34:13,680
and Joey Diaz is on stage
screaming the lyrics too,

2651
02:34:13,880 --> 02:34:18,310
along with the sound that's coming over
the loudspeaker, which is, you know, Ozzie

2652
02:34:18,550 --> 02:34:21,400
and they're doing like the different
color lights, like Joey's on stage.

2653
02:34:21,760 --> 02:34:24,370
And I just sat back and
we were all barbecued.

2654
02:34:24,610 --> 02:34:26,410
We're all completely
baked out of her mind.

2655
02:34:26,530 --> 02:34:29,470
Sat back and laughed and we
were all just clapping and just,

2656
02:34:29,770 --> 02:34:31,840
it was such a pure performance.

2657
02:34:32,020 --> 02:34:34,270
It's great cause he wasn't
trying to impress anybody.

2658
02:34:34,450 --> 02:34:37,030
There was no one there to see him.
There was no audience.

2659
02:34:37,300 --> 02:34:40,300
It was just us having fun and like,
like I said,

2660
02:34:40,330 --> 02:34:44,200
maybe four people in the crowd maybe.
Yeah.

2661
02:34:44,260 --> 02:34:47,080
That's some shit that only takes
place at the comedy store. I,

2662
02:34:47,270 --> 02:34:50,980
that's why I love it. It feels like
you're just hanging out with your friends,

2663
02:34:51,130 --> 02:34:56,050
getting wasted, you know, and having fun
and getting, it's just playing around in,

2664
02:34:56,230 --> 02:34:57,580
you know,
doing silly shit.

2665
02:34:57,610 --> 02:35:01,780
And you would think because it's the
comedy store that it would be packed all

2666
02:35:01,781 --> 02:35:05,680
the time. It's the gut is getting
in. Let her location. No you can't.

2667
02:35:06,160 --> 02:35:09,350
It's got this name. You
know, like when I was a, uh,

2668
02:35:09,370 --> 02:35:12,940
an open miker we'd heard about the
comedy store. It was like Mecca.

2669
02:35:13,510 --> 02:35:17,020
It was like I would always wanted
to be at the comedy store, you know,

2670
02:35:17,021 --> 02:35:18,700
to me like getting,

2671
02:35:18,760 --> 02:35:22,660
becoming a paid regular at the comedy
store was more important that getting my

2672
02:35:22,661 --> 02:35:26,000
first television show. It's
interesting. Yeah. Cause it was, it was,

2673
02:35:26,030 --> 02:35:30,040
that was the spot that was her Kinison
came from. That was what prior came from.

2674
02:35:30,280 --> 02:35:35,080
They all started the comedy store.
So when I was there and you would,

2675
02:35:35,290 --> 02:35:38,950
I would show up the first time I was
there, it wasn't even half full. I was,

2676
02:35:38,951 --> 02:35:42,550
I was there at the, in the or and
like some terrible actors on stage,

2677
02:35:42,551 --> 02:35:46,060
some fucking singing,
nothing. Some was blue.

2678
02:35:47,230 --> 02:35:51,020
It was dog shit. And I remember
going, this is the common, he's like,

2679
02:35:51,021 --> 02:35:53,470
what the fuck is going on?
But this is this place.

2680
02:35:53,590 --> 02:35:57,250
I would expect it to be like when
you see live in the sunset strip,

2681
02:35:57,370 --> 02:35:59,990
like a line around the block,
the WHO's who of Hollywood's,

2682
02:36:00,000 --> 02:36:03,700
they're the greatest comics in the world
are all going up. Nope. It was like

2683
02:36:04,040 --> 02:36:08,270
when I first went out, what year was
that? 85. It was like that was it.

2684
02:36:08,271 --> 02:36:10,880
Like that was the Kinison
days, right? Yeah. Yeah.

2685
02:36:11,510 --> 02:36:16,370
Well I first went there and uh, he used
to go on right before Sam at the end.

2686
02:36:16,670 --> 02:36:21,270
Wow. Um, we became friends, a lot
of, a lot of laughs. A lot of,

2687
02:36:21,390 --> 02:36:24,040
a lot of fucking lips to blow with them.
What's that?

2688
02:36:24,140 --> 02:36:26,930
Did you ever do blow with him? No. I
thought he said, did you ever blow?

2689
02:36:28,760 --> 02:36:31,080
Did he ever offer it to, you know, he knew

2690
02:36:31,080 --> 02:36:34,800
me. He knew I wasn't, I see
the thing about Sam and I,
we were, it could be friends,

2691
02:36:34,801 --> 02:36:37,770
but I'm not a follower and I
don't want to be a leader either,

2692
02:36:38,160 --> 02:36:41,750
but I just rather just paying
and you know, I was, I like,

2693
02:36:41,760 --> 02:36:45,270
I would never be part of his entourage.
Yeah. He had a whole cult of following.

2694
02:36:45,271 --> 02:36:49,630
Right. And the outlaws. Yeah. And, but
we had a lot of fun together. I mean,

2695
02:36:49,670 --> 02:36:52,590
we had a lot of laughs.
I was always glad when he was there.

2696
02:36:53,460 --> 02:36:58,020
I passed the first time I auditioned
there and then she forgot me.

2697
02:36:58,600 --> 02:37:03,150
So then I had to audition again,
you know?

2698
02:37:04,800 --> 02:37:07,680
But yeah, it was fun. It was amazing.
You know, cause I remember him,

2699
02:37:07,681 --> 02:37:11,400
Roseanne couldn't get on in the
main room and couldn't get on.

2700
02:37:11,490 --> 02:37:15,120
She couldn't get a spot in the main
room. When was this? In 85 she couldn't.

2701
02:37:15,140 --> 02:37:18,970
I thought she was already huge in 85 no,
this was probably later than 85 yeah,

2702
02:37:18,971 --> 02:37:22,880
I always heard that. Right when she moved
here. She got to show the same day. Yeah,

2703
02:37:22,881 --> 02:37:26,510
she means she was giant.
Oh No. Oh God. Look,

2704
02:37:26,511 --> 02:37:30,660
I remember working in Vegas with her and
she couldn't get on that. She was good.

2705
02:37:30,661 --> 02:37:33,440
She, she all she wanted, there was
a spot in the first show. Main Room.

2706
02:37:33,830 --> 02:37:37,580
Why that was the money spots cause that's
when we would all make four or $500,

2707
02:37:37,581 --> 02:37:42,110
which was a lot then, you know, write,
write, write town. I used to make,

2708
02:37:42,430 --> 02:37:45,880
well I started out at the
comedy store in Hawaii. I went,

2709
02:37:45,980 --> 02:37:49,220
I had a very circuitous route
to the comedy store in Hawaii.

2710
02:37:49,250 --> 02:37:53,690
I did the Hawaii with Barry Sobel
and carry snow. Then I went to,

2711
02:37:53,750 --> 02:37:57,080
uh, I went to a la Jolla, did well there,

2712
02:37:57,170 --> 02:38:00,310
went to Vegas and that went well.
And then I went that.

2713
02:38:00,380 --> 02:38:03,080
And so I didn't really start doing the
common story until I had done like the

2714
02:38:03,081 --> 02:38:06,810
tour. Wow. That weird. They
had a Westwood one too, right?

2715
02:38:07,560 --> 02:38:09,200
That was a little before my time.
Westwood.

2716
02:38:09,201 --> 02:38:12,950
It was on West Wood Avenue in the Westwood
one was where Kennison really like

2717
02:38:12,951 --> 02:38:15,030
started out.
That's where you're really like develop.

2718
02:38:15,080 --> 02:38:17,690
Apparently I took a friend
of mine who's a priest,

2719
02:38:18,050 --> 02:38:20,160
is the reason I went in to see the,

2720
02:38:20,161 --> 02:38:25,130
the room and Sam was on and my
friend's hair was back. I said,

2721
02:38:25,131 --> 02:38:29,690
it's not always like this.
It's, especially back then,

2722
02:38:29,691 --> 02:38:33,500
nobody knew who Sam was. Nobody saw that
coming. Oh, it was fucking incredible.

2723
02:38:33,530 --> 02:38:36,020
Incredible energy. Yeah. That, um,

2724
02:38:36,050 --> 02:38:40,640
the comedy store had a whole like series
of clumps and now they're down to how

2725
02:38:40,641 --> 02:38:43,700
many were there and they were all
consumed. People owned them. Well,

2726
02:38:43,701 --> 02:38:48,230
there was a dog. Mitzi. Yeah. Yeah. Well,
not the same people. Same One person.

2727
02:38:48,270 --> 02:38:52,040
All right. Yeah. Let's see. You still
make a lot of money in Vegas, man. Yeah.

2728
02:38:52,760 --> 02:38:56,620
Why don't they out? Well, obviously
now it's a mass, but so what,

2729
02:38:56,630 --> 02:38:59,780
think the comedy store in Vegas
would be a no brainer. You know,

2730
02:38:59,870 --> 02:39:02,540
what happened to the original one?
They should, they should have.

2731
02:39:03,510 --> 02:39:06,980
They raised it because, uh,
the Bellagio bought it out.

2732
02:39:07,460 --> 02:39:11,580
That's where the Bellagio is
now. I would think that, um,

2733
02:39:12,110 --> 02:39:14,300
that would be a no
brainer for a franchise.

2734
02:39:14,301 --> 02:39:16,040
I mean Improv's are all over the country.

2735
02:39:16,370 --> 02:39:18,530
It's amazing that the comedy store never,
yeah,

2736
02:39:18,531 --> 02:39:20,640
the impact is really
knew how to franchise it.

2737
02:39:20,641 --> 02:39:25,040
And Jamie and Jamie's doing it too. Yeah.
Yeah. With Chicago and Vegas. Right.

2738
02:39:25,070 --> 02:39:27,440
You were just in the laugh
factory back in Chicago with me.

2739
02:39:27,441 --> 02:39:32,390
I'm going there in October by the,
I give you a $2 to do a full weekend,

2740
02:39:32,480 --> 02:39:37,430
but you'll be at laff factory.
It's a lot of money for a of factory.

2741
02:39:37,460 --> 02:39:38,690
He really off for your shit.
Money.

2742
02:39:39,490 --> 02:39:44,050
I usually air allegedly
and we're on the air.

2743
02:39:44,060 --> 02:39:47,740
Allegedly. He got a pair of deal
allegedly now they fixed it. I have no,

2744
02:39:47,970 --> 02:39:52,880
I have no tech. Nope.
That's what makes you funny.

2745
02:39:52,940 --> 02:39:55,710
If you had tacked, we'd get in the
way of a lot of good jokes. Thank you.

2746
02:39:55,711 --> 02:39:59,990
Joseph would right? Yeah. Tact with
the fucking shitty old for you.

2747
02:40:00,350 --> 02:40:01,910
Hey Dominic,

2748
02:40:04,610 --> 02:40:08,470
smoothing out your mess and
how you got a know mess.

2749
02:40:09,950 --> 02:40:13,130
I didn't know herpes couldn't move to
the, but I, from talking about earlier

2750
02:40:13,980 --> 02:40:16,680
herpes, you could shut the
fuck up. I think that um,

2751
02:40:16,920 --> 02:40:20,340
Mitzi like had an issue with like the
idea of franchising because they had to be

2752
02:40:20,341 --> 02:40:24,030
comedy store comics and if you had
franchise a certain point in time,

2753
02:40:24,031 --> 02:40:27,750
you seen it down, the more we
need 365 days a year, you know,

2754
02:40:27,751 --> 02:40:32,310
she would have a seven night a week show
at 365 days a year of good comics and

2755
02:40:32,311 --> 02:40:34,590
you're flying him out to
Louisville, Kentucky. Good luck.

2756
02:40:34,710 --> 02:40:37,830
There's no one's going to do a week.
No. I mean this is Vegas clubs.

2757
02:40:37,831 --> 02:40:40,770
Like they used to do that at the Riv.
Right. You would do Monday through Sunday.

2758
02:40:40,800 --> 02:40:44,440
You'd do the whole week.
Yeah. Yeah. You'd have to,

2759
02:40:44,441 --> 02:40:48,220
you'd have to stay for seven days. I
go and get calls from buddies. Yeah.

2760
02:40:48,230 --> 02:40:50,440
They didn't make me do that.
I did Thursday through Sunday.

2761
02:40:50,590 --> 02:40:51,970
I just did Friday and Saturday.

2762
02:40:51,971 --> 02:40:54,850
I did the late night shows because I
couldn't do the regular show at the river.

2763
02:40:55,300 --> 02:40:56,770
I could only do remember that extreme,

2764
02:40:58,030 --> 02:41:02,440
extreme extreme. You and Slayton. Yeah.

2765
02:41:02,620 --> 02:41:05,140
Thank God I would, I
couldn't do it. I can't,

2766
02:41:05,141 --> 02:41:06,910
I can't do Vegas from more
than a couple of days.

2767
02:41:06,911 --> 02:41:09,340
I Love Vegas for a couple of days.
It was killing me.

2768
02:41:09,880 --> 02:41:14,830
How many days you do this past one. Uh,
for, but I went in early and it came,

2769
02:41:15,090 --> 02:41:18,900
came back late and so Wednesday through
Monday or something like that. Yeah. That,

2770
02:41:18,930 --> 02:41:22,690
that's when I, cause I didn't want to fly
in the heat. Right. Like go to the floor.

2771
02:41:22,740 --> 02:41:25,690
I can't fucking take that.
I didn't intend to Greece.

2772
02:41:26,380 --> 02:41:30,310
I'm very delicate artists. What's
your favorite place to work in Vegas?

2773
02:41:31,240 --> 02:41:31,810
Yeah.

2774
02:41:31,810 --> 02:41:34,110
Uh Oh God. That's what
Beth to see. That's,

2775
02:41:34,190 --> 02:41:38,770
that's a bad question is a bad question.
Why? Because you just worked for Jamie.

2776
02:41:39,130 --> 02:41:40,030
You don't want to tell the truth.

2777
02:41:40,690 --> 02:41:43,720
Well you know it was for act
like to tell you it was fun.

2778
02:41:43,750 --> 02:41:44,920
It was a fucking great job.

2779
02:41:44,950 --> 02:41:49,630
Was I opened for Cher for years in the
early nineties when we did the Mirage.

2780
02:41:49,750 --> 02:41:50,680
The Mirage is great.

2781
02:41:50,710 --> 02:41:53,770
They used to call me easy money cause I
would be at the sports book and this is

2782
02:41:53,771 --> 02:41:55,000
when I could still fucking jump.

2783
02:41:55,250 --> 02:41:59,590
I'd hop over to fucking rail just a minute
to eight because everything starts on

2784
02:41:59,591 --> 02:42:04,060
time there. Boom. I fucking slide
across the stage, do my stew,

2785
02:42:04,061 --> 02:42:07,660
25 minutes and then I go in the
back of the crew fucking with me.

2786
02:42:07,661 --> 02:42:12,160
They'd have a chair and a towel and
water. You'll KZ money. All right guys.

2787
02:42:12,200 --> 02:42:14,830
Almost a 26 tonight.
I went crazy.

2788
02:42:16,870 --> 02:42:20,350
That was a fun game. You say hop over
the sports book. We betting. Yeah.

2789
02:42:20,770 --> 02:42:23,380
So you'd gamble up until the moment you're
supposed to go on stage and he'd run.

2790
02:42:23,390 --> 02:42:27,460
It was a big gambler, but
yeah, I would bet on games
and stuff. I like to watch it.

2791
02:42:27,461 --> 02:42:28,570
I like it to stretch out.

2792
02:42:28,571 --> 02:42:31,390
I don't want to put everything on
black and then leave a fucking loser.

2793
02:42:31,510 --> 02:42:34,360
Well if you,
especially like if you're a sports fan,

2794
02:42:34,450 --> 02:42:37,480
it makes the game more exciting, right?
Oh yeah. Well that makes everything,

2795
02:42:37,481 --> 02:42:39,760
I mean that's what I love
about Benton football. Like,

2796
02:42:39,820 --> 02:42:43,630
like with the pro football starting
tomorrow night. I fucking love it.

2797
02:42:43,660 --> 02:42:46,960
I love the over under the over under is,
yeah,

2798
02:42:47,260 --> 02:42:49,620
I loved that because especially if you're,

2799
02:42:49,630 --> 02:42:52,870
I'm pretty over because you rooting
for everybody. It's all positive.

2800
02:42:53,290 --> 02:42:54,550
Like the unders,
all negative.

2801
02:42:54,551 --> 02:42:58,210
Don't drop that tear drop that peers
can get that motherfucker. I was like,

2802
02:42:58,960 --> 02:43:02,790
but the overall is fun. Yeah. Positive
beddings by the negative Bennett. Yeah.

2803
02:43:02,880 --> 02:43:05,980
There's a cheer sometimes in Vegas.
If you watch a boxing match,

2804
02:43:06,190 --> 02:43:08,020
they'll have an over
under on how many rounds?

2805
02:43:08,340 --> 02:43:11,080
The bet that and then it'll hit
the fifth round. Everybody goes

2806
02:43:12,640 --> 02:43:15,190
like there's a roar in the crowd.
Yeah.

2807
02:43:15,210 --> 02:43:18,920
Like I think it was Larry Merchant that
actually brought it up once during a

2808
02:43:18,921 --> 02:43:19,870
broadcast.
Yeah.

2809
02:43:19,900 --> 02:43:23,770
The reason why these people were cheering
because cause they gambled won it.

2810
02:43:24,940 --> 02:43:26,950
Yeah. There's a lot of
proposition bets like that.

2811
02:43:27,040 --> 02:43:30,160
Like you could bet a
bunch of fights parlay.

2812
02:43:30,430 --> 02:43:34,420
Put them all together if you get them all
right. It's sane amount of money. Never.

2813
02:43:35,100 --> 02:43:38,170
Aubrey is a big gambler.
He always Campbell's in Vegas.

2814
02:43:38,171 --> 02:43:42,130
He's never hit that shit yet. He's gotten
close though. It's always one shit.

2815
02:43:42,131 --> 02:43:46,900
Judge's decision fucks you up. I
can't get into it. Gambling on fights,

2816
02:43:47,010 --> 02:43:49,870
gambling on anything. Why not even
slot machines and all that stuff.

2817
02:43:49,871 --> 02:43:53,650
It's just for fun. It's not right. Like
I'm addicted to it or cards. Nothing.

2818
02:43:53,651 --> 02:43:56,570
Bedding. It's probably good. Yeah, it's
probably good that you don't do that.

2819
02:43:56,690 --> 02:43:58,420
I just don't know shit.
It just hit me.

2820
02:43:58,421 --> 02:44:02,090
I realized my favorite club
to work in Vegas. Bread,

2821
02:44:02,091 --> 02:44:05,880
carrots club cause it working there
in October. I can't believe it.

2822
02:44:05,881 --> 02:44:09,910
It just hit me. Use Club
was a Tropicana, but now

2823
02:44:11,980 --> 02:44:15,250
I didn't just hit up a memory. Lost
it for real. A real memory loss.

2824
02:44:15,400 --> 02:44:18,550
You always talk about Brad Garret's.
I was waiting for you to bring it up.

2825
02:44:18,880 --> 02:44:21,940
I was wondering why. I thought you were
out of reverence to Jamie. Well, it's,

2826
02:44:21,941 --> 02:44:25,480
it gets my bread. I was, I
worked for dad out of body,

2827
02:44:25,690 --> 02:44:27,340
but the Mike Collab is bad.

2828
02:44:27,610 --> 02:44:29,770
You got to see his club with
these fucking chicks there.

2829
02:44:29,780 --> 02:44:32,020
Switch one that Brad Carrow.
I'm like, God, they got,

2830
02:44:32,021 --> 02:44:34,840
did you ever since you book a
weekend when I'm there for UFC,

2831
02:44:34,900 --> 02:44:39,880
I would love to MGM. Right? How often? Uh,
yeah, downstairs. The Mgm, it looks Nice.

2832
02:44:39,881 --> 02:44:42,610
I pass by it. I've never
performed there. We did that once.

2833
02:44:42,611 --> 02:44:46,830
I remember we had a couple of times I
was there for your uh, your fights. Yeah,

2834
02:44:46,940 --> 02:44:49,930
but I never got to see
you at Brad Garrett. Um,

2835
02:44:50,220 --> 02:44:54,970
there's a bunch of UFC is coming up.
So how often do you go to, to Vegas?

2836
02:44:54,971 --> 02:44:57,900
How often you do it? Three. Three or
four times a year. What about January?

2837
02:44:57,901 --> 02:45:00,820
You got anything booked in January?
The weekend of January 2nd.

2838
02:45:00,821 --> 02:45:03,510
That's the weekend. The UFC is going
to be in Vegas like great fights too.

2839
02:45:04,080 --> 02:45:08,500
It's like I could do that. Let's do it
doable and you can come during the day.

2840
02:45:08,501 --> 02:45:11,800
You can see the fight started for so
you could watch the fights from like,

2841
02:45:11,801 --> 02:45:15,220
what's the first show at eight?
There's only one show. What time is it?

2842
02:45:15,580 --> 02:45:19,810
I don't know if you'd get them
to do it at 10. That's the shit.

2843
02:45:20,240 --> 02:45:23,230
But dumb. Get them. Do it a 10.

2844
02:45:23,231 --> 02:45:26,620
You can see all the fisticuffs then get
over there with ample time and then eat

2845
02:45:26,621 --> 02:45:31,000
mushrooms at 11 what is it?
It's, it's at the MGM sometimes.

2846
02:45:31,360 --> 02:45:33,370
Sometimes at Mandalay bay.
Sometimes MGM.

2847
02:45:33,371 --> 02:45:35,860
Those are the only two places
I was at the palm one time.

2848
02:45:36,620 --> 02:45:40,180
They used to do it at the palm. They don't
do it at the palm anymore. Dana White,

2849
02:45:40,181 --> 02:45:44,770
uh, he gambles too much and he
broke them. Smash the palm. Yeah.

2850
02:45:44,920 --> 02:45:47,320
Did he really? Yeah, he smashed him.
They banned them when they banned them.

2851
02:45:47,321 --> 02:45:51,130
He pulled the UFC out and they started
doing the smaller events at the hard rock.

2852
02:45:51,170 --> 02:45:55,510
He was winning. Oh yeah. Wow. He
wins. He wins. Big Man. He Bent,

2853
02:45:55,540 --> 02:45:58,600
he loses big money, but he
gambles big money. He gets crazy.

2854
02:45:58,601 --> 02:46:02,890
You like $1 million a night. Wow.
Oh my God. Yeah. I don't get it.

2855
02:46:03,640 --> 02:46:04,540
I don't know how you could do that.

2856
02:46:04,541 --> 02:46:08,350
It's like keep a pulse and not fucking
scares me. Sweat all your blood out.

2857
02:46:09,210 --> 02:46:13,310
It seems like, it just seems like I
would if I lost $1 million in a night,

2858
02:46:13,311 --> 02:46:17,240
I was totally quit. But he's won like
five or six months, not really gambling.

2859
02:46:17,241 --> 02:46:19,930
You know what gambling is?
If you have a plot,

2860
02:46:20,000 --> 02:46:23,360
a guy who's better equal to you and
pull and you play pool, that's gambling.

2861
02:46:23,420 --> 02:46:24,560
Right?
But you're not,

2862
02:46:24,620 --> 02:46:27,890
you know these fuck casinos wouldn't
have crystal chandelier is that people

2863
02:46:27,891 --> 02:46:30,080
really gambling?
The odds are set against them.

2864
02:46:30,620 --> 02:46:32,030
They definitely are set against you.

2865
02:46:32,031 --> 02:46:35,630
But if you're good at certain
games like blackjack, yeah,

2866
02:46:35,631 --> 02:46:39,290
there's a more of a level field. I mean
certain things are fucking ridiculous.

2867
02:46:39,290 --> 02:46:43,250
Slot machines. Desert ridiculous.
Yeah. They post the rigged.

2868
02:46:43,490 --> 02:46:46,250
It's not even like it's a machine.
Like they set them,

2869
02:46:46,370 --> 02:46:48,830
they can set them to easier or harder.

2870
02:46:49,070 --> 02:46:51,560
Like they can decide whether or
not you're going to win or lose.

2871
02:46:51,590 --> 02:46:54,230
Like they could set it.
So it's one person wins a month,

2872
02:46:54,550 --> 02:46:59,120
you know video poker to you. Yeah,
because you sit there, you get the drinks.

2873
02:47:00,120 --> 02:47:03,870
What ain't nobody you'd under
no anybody like blackjack toys.

2874
02:47:03,950 --> 02:47:07,700
Like keep your hands off the
table, sir. Not like that. Crazy.

2875
02:47:07,701 --> 02:47:10,610
People get pissed at you.
I've heard people say that like if you,

2876
02:47:10,640 --> 02:47:12,320
if you're playing
blackjack at a bad table,

2877
02:47:12,321 --> 02:47:14,190
when someone doesn't know what
they're doing, they fuck up the hand.

2878
02:47:15,020 --> 02:47:17,360
How could they fuck? I mean,
I see what they're saying,

2879
02:47:17,361 --> 02:47:20,450
but that's a weird way of looking
at it that they fuck up your hand.

2880
02:47:20,540 --> 02:47:23,870
Like what kind of a whack ass game
are you playing with someone else?

2881
02:47:24,020 --> 02:47:28,100
Making shitty decisions affects you.
They affect the card count. Yeah.

2882
02:47:28,220 --> 02:47:30,920
They make the, you know,
whenever I'm craps too,

2883
02:47:30,921 --> 02:47:33,800
I don't even understand that fucking
name, that deck games. Ridiculous.

2884
02:47:33,830 --> 02:47:37,640
You've got to know too much.
Yeah. Richard. Jenny used
to have a bit about crabs.

2885
02:47:37,670 --> 02:47:40,580
It's fucking funny. Bit
Too. Yeah, yeah. Yeah.

2886
02:47:40,850 --> 02:47:45,850
About how he doesn't like a
certain games because like he,

2887
02:47:46,260 --> 02:47:49,160
he, he liked games where nobody
knows what the fuck is going on.

2888
02:47:49,190 --> 02:47:52,400
That's what this whole thing about craps.
So funny bit man,

2889
02:47:52,800 --> 02:47:56,480
that he did that bit like on the
tonight show, I think. I never saw that.

2890
02:47:56,481 --> 02:47:58,830
I used to love his ref bit.
Let's see if we can find it. See,

2891
02:47:58,860 --> 02:48:01,590
see if you can find Richard
Jenny on craps and we'll,

2892
02:48:01,591 --> 02:48:06,290
we'll end with this at a respect for
our late friend Mitch, the Jenny.

2893
02:48:07,220 --> 02:48:11,450
He's a guy we've talked about a hundred
times on the, on the podcast that, uh,

2894
02:48:11,480 --> 02:48:16,010
he doesn't get enough respect.
Fucking great. Stand the,
Oh yeah, man. When he was,

2895
02:48:16,100 --> 02:48:20,210
when he was the best,
when he like in the late eighties ish,

2896
02:48:20,270 --> 02:48:22,940
somewhere around there like
88 89 he was one of the best,

2897
02:48:22,970 --> 02:48:24,290
one of the best in the country.
Just did,

2898
02:48:24,291 --> 02:48:27,630
but didn't get that sort of like
the same respect like Kennesaw.

2899
02:48:28,400 --> 02:48:31,160
I think rich is brilliant.
I don't think he had the charisma.

2900
02:48:31,700 --> 02:48:34,270
That's my x that are not
as good as him or put,

2901
02:48:34,280 --> 02:48:37,830
get bigger than him because you know,
is this a Brian?

2902
02:48:39,470 --> 02:48:44,360
No, no. Richard. Jeni craps on
craps. Just written no, but on crap.

2903
02:48:44,660 --> 02:48:49,160
That's why it, cause that's
it. This came up as the second.

2904
02:48:49,580 --> 02:48:50,630
Okay,
let's give her a shot.

2905
02:48:51,110 --> 02:48:51,943
Okay.

2906
02:48:57,250 --> 02:49:00,100
We're stressor.
He dressed like a guy who

2907
02:49:02,150 --> 02:49:02,983
he's on a boat.

2908
02:49:05,400 --> 02:49:08,580
Oh, always can always in a
good mood around holidays.

2909
02:49:08,581 --> 02:49:12,390
I had a great thanksgiving boy. I was
so thankful. Thankful on Thanksgiving.

2910
02:49:14,010 --> 02:49:16,320
Yeah. Look at that Turkey
and I'm thinking, Hey,

2911
02:49:16,321 --> 02:49:18,090
life is tough and you have problems,

2912
02:49:18,091 --> 02:49:23,090
but nobody ever cuts a hole in your
ass and filled you with mushrooms. Wow.

2913
02:49:24,280 --> 02:49:27,080
Bravo.
Jay Leno was edging.

2914
02:49:27,100 --> 02:49:30,150
Imagine problems without bringing
up that model of self restraint.

2915
02:49:30,170 --> 02:49:33,360
President Bill Clinton won a guy.
Gotta give him credit.

2916
02:49:33,361 --> 02:49:37,030
You gotta give the Guy I can't get my
girlfriend. The smoke, the Gar. Backtrack.

2917
02:49:40,930 --> 02:49:42,910
I guess the thing that annoys people is,
you know,

2918
02:49:42,911 --> 02:49:45,530
you kind of want the president to be
a hero when it turns out, you know,

2919
02:49:45,550 --> 02:49:49,200
Clinton is just like every other stupid
guy. He can't turn down oral sex.

2920
02:49:49,210 --> 02:49:53,820
He can't. You get no Guy Dad, because
I couldn't buy in to do activities.

2921
02:49:53,830 --> 02:49:58,830
No guy ever gets tired up one sec to not
moving at all so big they can't believe

2922
02:50:02,021 --> 02:50:06,080
it's happening. At the same time, there's
been able to remote in exam, which going,

2923
02:50:06,160 --> 02:50:10,060
those are the big Joe.
I'm not moving.

2924
02:50:10,120 --> 02:50:12,120
I'm with my girl can talk.
What's better than,

2925
02:50:16,260 --> 02:50:20,640
I don't know if this is the cramps bit.
Hopefully this is really one at a time,

2926
02:50:20,650 --> 02:50:25,030
Huh? No. You know,

2927
02:50:25,040 --> 02:50:27,440
I think she'd be president. You
hear me out here? Jack Kevorkian.

2928
02:50:28,390 --> 02:50:29,720
You know why he doesn't lie.

2929
02:50:29,780 --> 02:50:34,780
This guy has nerve [inaudible] himself
and 60 minutes ending a guy's life so you

2930
02:50:34,901 --> 02:50:37,160
can get arrested on purpose
and if he's going to fix it,

2931
02:50:37,161 --> 02:50:40,610
he's going to starve himself in jail
as a protest. Now that is courage.

2932
02:50:40,760 --> 02:50:43,400
That's commitment. That's the
guy standing up and saying, hey,

2933
02:50:43,700 --> 02:50:48,640
I don't want to live. If it means
I can kill other people. Nerve

2934
02:50:51,220 --> 02:50:54,370
nerve. I mean think about
it. Think of a comparison.

2935
02:50:54,380 --> 02:50:58,260
You Know Bill Clinton commits adultery
live and squirmed and would've been if it

2936
02:50:58,270 --> 02:51:03,270
was single person Jack and warhead commit
first degree murder and broadcast on

2937
02:51:03,681 --> 02:51:07,780
national television. He is not
the type of guy with Jay. No,

2938
02:51:08,060 --> 02:51:09,320
I didn't do it.
Not Him.

2939
02:51:09,690 --> 02:51:13,220
He'd be on the White House lawn having
sex with an intern and doing bong hits

2940
02:51:13,221 --> 02:51:14,240
out of the death machine.

2941
02:51:17,310 --> 02:51:18,600
How much time is listening to us?

2942
02:51:23,410 --> 02:51:23,940
Okay,

2943
02:51:23,940 --> 02:51:26,160
did give it a little bump and
it has been to make the segue.

2944
02:51:27,010 --> 02:51:30,790
Well, I'm happy if it's
doing its job. Mean

2945
02:51:32,430 --> 02:51:37,120
it was depressing out gravy was pointed
right at his crotch and he goes, Dave,

2946
02:51:39,050 --> 02:51:40,640
nope.
Anyway.

2947
02:51:41,300 --> 02:51:42,190
Jessa isn't that weird?

2948
02:51:42,191 --> 02:51:45,850
That sort of tonight's show type comedy
where you have like seven minutes,

2949
02:51:45,851 --> 02:51:50,010
five minutes. Yeah. Sort of rushing that
every bit I hate. Right in those sets. I,

2950
02:51:50,380 --> 02:51:54,880
last time I did it was a Jimmy Fallon
and I had fun because I liked Jimmy and

2951
02:51:54,890 --> 02:51:56,050
then you know the band,

2952
02:51:56,051 --> 02:52:00,370
but it's like they're still fucking when
he was doing his show or the TV show,

2953
02:52:00,550 --> 02:52:04,870
his show. Yeah. It's hard. It's
hard. It's not real comedy.

2954
02:52:04,871 --> 02:52:06,590
It's a uh,
like a clue.

2955
02:52:06,700 --> 02:52:10,510
It's like the difference between a
preview to a movie and the actual movie

2956
02:52:10,511 --> 02:52:13,660
itself. Yeah, I think that's a
good way of putting it. I mean,

2957
02:52:13,661 --> 02:52:17,110
there's no soul to it. Yeah,
he can't, he can't get deep.

2958
02:52:17,260 --> 02:52:20,740
Everybody knows it's only going to last
five minutes and you have a few minutes

2959
02:52:20,741 --> 02:52:23,860
and you just wrap it up and that's over.
I've seen a couple of guys,

2960
02:52:23,861 --> 02:52:26,440
I mean Silento was perfect
for that. Well, Richard,

2961
02:52:26,441 --> 02:52:29,170
Jenny was really good at it too, cause
they look real good joke writer out of it.

2962
02:52:29,171 --> 02:52:29,960
He was rich.

2963
02:52:29,960 --> 02:52:34,900
W was he flushed out bits so well that
the tick took away from that part of him.

2964
02:52:34,901 --> 02:52:36,760
You know what I mean? Yeah. That was his,

2965
02:52:36,790 --> 02:52:40,210
that was his number one thing that
he was really good at and that's,

2966
02:52:40,211 --> 02:52:41,650
I learned that from him actually.

2967
02:52:41,651 --> 02:52:46,510
I've talked about it before about how
to really like get the most out of a big

2968
02:52:46,511 --> 02:52:51,160
thing out of his subject. What is it?
A card table. Dating card table. No,

2969
02:52:51,220 --> 02:52:56,200
I don't think that's it on craps
playing craps. Maybe playing craps.

2970
02:52:56,650 --> 02:52:58,660
It was an old bit.
So the,

2971
02:52:58,661 --> 02:53:03,400
all those looked like there were
two too recent for it to be him.

2972
02:53:05,290 --> 02:53:08,530
No worries. It's over folks.
Fucking podcasts over dot.

2973
02:53:08,531 --> 02:53:11,800
Merera I love you to death too,
Joe. Thanks for having me on buddy.

2977

2979
