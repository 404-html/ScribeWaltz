1
00:00:00,860 --> 00:00:02,850
Hello,
freak bitches.

2
00:00:03,210 --> 00:00:05,030
Yeah.
I'm going to quote Sinbad.

3
00:00:05,320 --> 00:00:06,730
Say that you got.
I love the.

4
00:00:06,731 --> 00:00:07,564
I love this quote.
He goes,

5
00:00:07,770 --> 00:00:09,150
he's a very nice guy.
He was great.

6
00:00:09,151 --> 00:00:11,220
He did my podcast.
Tony Hands Club says he's awesome.

7
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:13,710
Talk about leaving your body.
Astral projection.

8
00:00:13,830 --> 00:00:15,330
Same bad.
Does it?

9
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:18,110
He asked truly projects,
astral project.

10
00:00:18,150 --> 00:00:19,590
How's he do that?
He stopped doing well.

11
00:00:19,591 --> 00:00:21,840
There's all these techniques.
There's there's books and stuff about

12
00:00:21,841 --> 00:00:23,580
it.
The long and the short is you get into a

13
00:00:23,581 --> 00:00:28,581
trance and you imagine a rope above you.
Then pull yourself down or what he did

14
00:00:29,581 --> 00:00:31,260
actually remember,
he was like,

15
00:00:31,261 --> 00:00:35,310
I put something just out of my reach and
then you're trying,

16
00:00:35,370 --> 00:00:36,780
as you're laying there with your eyes
closed,

17
00:00:36,781 --> 00:00:38,730
kind of meditating,
you're trying to reach the thing,

18
00:00:39,060 --> 00:00:42,150
and then he said he felt his hand
wrapped around and that's how he knew he

19
00:00:42,151 --> 00:00:45,210
had left his body and he did it for
months and months and months and months,

20
00:00:45,211 --> 00:00:47,430
and then one day he said he was like in
this weird place.

21
00:00:47,430 --> 00:00:51,000
It was in the cave.
Some shadow creature came up and hit him

22
00:00:51,001 --> 00:00:53,230
in the chest.
I know this is sinbad,

23
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:55,730
remember,
and he goes and it felt like someone had

24
00:00:55,770 --> 00:00:58,080
cracked me in the chest with a sledge
hammer and he was like,

25
00:00:58,081 --> 00:00:59,660
I never did it again.
Whoa.

26
00:00:59,730 --> 00:01:00,421
And I was like,
really?

27
00:01:00,421 --> 00:01:02,850
You got to go back,
try and find like booby island or

28
00:01:02,851 --> 00:01:04,440
something.
He's right though.

29
00:01:04,441 --> 00:01:07,410
Maybe he's ready to be snatched up by
the demons in stranger things.

30
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:09,750
It is next dimension demon that lives in
the wall.

31
00:01:09,810 --> 00:01:13,590
It is scary if you read a journey's out
of the body are far.

32
00:01:13,591 --> 00:01:16,320
Journey is a Robert Monroe in the
fifties.

33
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:19,460
It's like you read this book and he
still calls black people negros and

34
00:01:19,470 --> 00:01:21,480
stuff like you can tell it's an old old
book,

35
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:23,590
but he's telling that's how old this
stuff is.

36
00:01:23,591 --> 00:01:27,420
It's because way back he would tell
stories about like seeing something fly

37
00:01:27,421 --> 00:01:30,570
by and being very concerned that that
thing was trying to get into his body

38
00:01:30,571 --> 00:01:31,440
before he did.

39
00:01:31,650 --> 00:01:34,410
So it's kind of a scary thing,
but it's one of those things.

40
00:01:34,411 --> 00:01:38,220
So I was under the impression that
people did die when most people are

41
00:01:38,221 --> 00:01:39,320
under that impression.
I've,

42
00:01:39,350 --> 00:01:40,650
I've had,
I've spoken,

43
00:01:41,010 --> 00:01:44,340
given talks at medical schools and stuff
and all these doctors think that

44
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:48,420
everyone died at 35 or 35 year old
results and they're like,

45
00:01:48,421 --> 00:01:51,120
and it works its way into medicine where
they're like,

46
00:01:51,121 --> 00:01:51,631
okay,
look,

47
00:01:51,631 --> 00:01:55,560
the reason you have chronic back pain is
that the human body was not evolved to

48
00:01:55,561 --> 00:01:59,220
live beyond 35,
and so of course you have wear and tear

49
00:01:59,221 --> 00:02:02,850
and things like that's totally false.
The human bodies evolved to live into

50
00:02:02,851 --> 00:02:06,330
the seventies,
so it's a statistical thing.

51
00:02:06,331 --> 00:02:08,490
It's like if Bill Gates moves into your
neighborhood,

52
00:02:08,491 --> 00:02:12,690
suddenly everyone's average annual
salary is hundreds of millions of

53
00:02:12,690 --> 00:02:13,290
dollars,
right?

54
00:02:13,290 --> 00:02:16,830
So if you count all these infants who
died in prehistory,

55
00:02:17,130 --> 00:02:19,650
many of whom by the way died from
infanticide,

56
00:02:19,710 --> 00:02:23,130
like twins normally are not allowed to
survive.

57
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:26,100
The,
the weaker one is left in the woods to

58
00:02:26,101 --> 00:02:26,934
die.
What?

59
00:02:27,190 --> 00:02:29,580
Yeah,
and any sort of deform and mal

60
00:02:29,581 --> 00:02:31,350
formality,
we just leave them in the woods by

61
00:02:31,351 --> 00:02:33,690
themselves.
What a cruel way to handle it.

62
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:35,600
Yeah.
Whew.

63
00:02:35,620 --> 00:02:37,530
That's dark man.
They would leave him to wolves.

64
00:02:38,130 --> 00:02:39,480
That's fucked up,
man.

65
00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:43,670
Leave your baby in a basket and runaway.
Ooh,

66
00:02:43,710 --> 00:02:44,560
yeah.
There's a lot of,

67
00:02:44,820 --> 00:02:47,070
a lot of infanticide,
but you know,

68
00:02:47,071 --> 00:02:48,120
in our world,
a lot of it,

69
00:02:48,121 --> 00:02:49,020
huh?
Yeah.

70
00:02:49,130 --> 00:02:50,790
Well,
just because the times were harder than.

71
00:02:50,791 --> 00:02:53,790
And it was more accepted that you were
going to have to do some terrible things

72
00:02:53,791 --> 00:02:54,990
that you didn't want to do.
Well,

73
00:02:54,991 --> 00:02:56,130
it's just that,
you know,

74
00:02:56,131 --> 00:03:00,400
if a kid's born physically fucked up in
some way,

75
00:03:01,790 --> 00:03:03,430
you know,
you're not gonna,

76
00:03:03,431 --> 00:03:05,950
you're not gonna have the resources and
that kid's not going to.

77
00:03:05,970 --> 00:03:09,640
The person's not going to grow up to
contribute to the group.

78
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:14,230
And so generally,
and also there's a different sense of

79
00:03:14,231 --> 00:03:15,910
life and death,
right?

80
00:03:15,930 --> 00:03:18,640
You know,
I think we're death is much more a daily

81
00:03:18,641 --> 00:03:20,830
presence.
It's not that big a deal.

82
00:03:21,250 --> 00:03:24,400
So we're all gonna die there.
I was reading about a tribe in the

83
00:03:24,401 --> 00:03:26,050
Amazon.
Uh,

84
00:03:26,051 --> 00:03:31,030
I can't remember the name of the tribe,
but when someone gets too old to keep up

85
00:03:31,031 --> 00:03:34,660
with the group,
someone is chosen randomly,

86
00:03:34,661 --> 00:03:38,140
like they have a lottery or pick the
shortest straw or whatever it is.

87
00:03:38,950 --> 00:03:43,600
And their job is to come up behind this
old person and hit him in the back of

88
00:03:43,601 --> 00:03:46,750
the head with a hatchet.
Oh boy.

89
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:49,140
Right.
And no one wants to do it.

90
00:03:49,141 --> 00:03:52,290
It really sucks,
but everyone agrees it has to be done.

91
00:03:52,350 --> 00:03:57,350
And it's the least cruel option that
they've come up.

92
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:59,950
Be careful to do to keep signing up for
that job.

93
00:04:00,940 --> 00:04:02,250
Exactly.
Got

94
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:08,140
Papa Joe.
You've killed nine old ladies.

95
00:04:08,141 --> 00:04:10,570
This lady.
This bitches gone over.

96
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:12,170
Okay.
We'll just let her stop.

97
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:15,400
It's weird,
man.

98
00:04:15,401 --> 00:04:18,460
It's a weird gig.
Kenton's wife tends to look at me like

99
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:22,800
that is the source of looseness right
there.

100
00:04:22,801 --> 00:04:27,801
That's single man with a mustache.
This man got cut loose to spend too much

101
00:04:28,421 --> 00:04:31,600
time with him.
It could all go down a feral.

102
00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:33,220
Yeah.
What's why.

103
00:04:33,221 --> 00:04:36,790
Like no one tells Ryan were to go.
Ryan can just go into the woods anytime

104
00:04:36,791 --> 00:04:37,930
he wants.
I don't think that's right.

105
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:39,230
Yeah.
What about d?

106
00:04:39,250 --> 00:04:41,920
Doesn't have a leash on how many times
did he call and check in,

107
00:04:41,950 --> 00:04:44,330
but I was just out there with no leash
collar.

108
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:46,390
I get a long leash.
I get along,

109
00:04:46,490 --> 00:04:50,140
especially during hunting season,
but mark might have a leash.

110
00:04:50,570 --> 00:04:52,230
Brian doesn't have a leash.
He just asked him.

111
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:53,260
He doesn't have to call anybody.

112
00:04:53,260 --> 00:04:55,060
He just goes where he wants it.
It is what it is.

113
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:57,130
Joe,
if he just decides to take that mustache

114
00:04:57,131 --> 00:05:00,640
and go for a hike,
nobody can tell him that.

115
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:02,910
That,
that pisses women off because then when

116
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:04,270
demand goes,
yeah,

117
00:05:04,610 --> 00:05:06,880
Hey,
Ryan says out there with no leash,

118
00:05:07,090 --> 00:05:09,580
just do whatever he wants.
I wish I was like that.

119
00:05:10,180 --> 00:05:11,950
Like I love being married.
I love having kids.

120
00:05:11,951 --> 00:05:13,390
I loved the whole deal.
I love having a family,

121
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:17,010
but I got a buddy,
my friend Ari.

122
00:05:17,050 --> 00:05:18,940
You know what he did?
He just went off the grid,

123
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,850
shut his fucking phone off.
He won't answer his emails.

124
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:25,540
He just disappeared.
He went to Pacific for so long.

125
00:05:25,750 --> 00:05:27,530
I just want to do it for a few months.
He's just.

126
00:05:27,570 --> 00:05:29,710
He's a standup comic.
Hilarious guy.

127
00:05:29,740 --> 00:05:32,080
Successful show on comedy central is
doing great.

128
00:05:32,170 --> 00:05:33,610
Kicking ass.
He just decided,

129
00:05:33,611 --> 00:05:35,710
you know what?
I need some experiences in my life to

130
00:05:35,711 --> 00:05:36,970
write about,
to talk about,

131
00:05:36,971 --> 00:05:39,870
so I'm just going to fucking stop
talking to people and disappear for a

132
00:05:39,870 --> 00:05:41,500
few months ago.
I talked to him in two months.

133
00:05:42,130 --> 00:05:43,810
I haven't talked to him.
I don't know where the fuck is.

134
00:05:43,811 --> 00:05:46,540
You call his voicemail.
It just says the subscriber.

135
00:05:46,541 --> 00:05:49,390
You have reached to shut off incoming
call or I'll play it for you.

136
00:05:49,391 --> 00:05:54,391
That's amazing dude.
This thing is just the most devious

137
00:05:55,121 --> 00:05:59,330
creation on
it is it is

138
00:05:59,740 --> 00:06:03,590
subscribers request.
This phone does not accept incoming

139
00:06:03,591 --> 00:06:07,310
calls.
Message in V one.

140
00:06:07,780 --> 00:06:08,620
Gotcha.
Phares.

141
00:06:08,660 --> 00:06:13,310
Rockin message [inaudible].
You don't give a fuck straight in the

142
00:06:13,311 --> 00:06:14,850
eye.
So if my wife heard that,

143
00:06:14,851 --> 00:06:18,210
well he's out there.
You think that's good?

144
00:06:18,690 --> 00:06:23,610
He's got no one to call in to check in,
but he can check in and do whatever he

145
00:06:23,611 --> 00:06:25,390
wants,
but he wouldn't call and say everything.

146
00:06:25,470 --> 00:06:25,921
Cool.
Yeah.

147
00:06:25,921 --> 00:06:27,630
How late she can call me up.
Hey faggot.

148
00:06:27,631 --> 00:06:28,950
I'm still alive and then hang up the
phone.

149
00:06:28,951 --> 00:06:29,820
That's it.
I'm like,

150
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:35,200
God damn the to checkout and we can.
I mean,

151
00:06:35,580 --> 00:06:39,960
where we are,
it is narrow valley public land

152
00:06:40,170 --> 00:06:42,990
everywhere.
As soon as you get off the valley floor,

153
00:06:42,991 --> 00:06:44,490
you're on public land like we talked
about.

154
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:47,070
I can hate.
I can hate to the fricking Yukon,

155
00:06:47,071 --> 00:06:49,410
man.
That's crazy and you can be

156
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:52,560
disconnected,
as disconnected as you want to be,

157
00:06:53,070 --> 00:06:56,010
and man,
there is no price tag on that.

158
00:06:56,070 --> 00:06:59,430
That's the thing and I need it.
