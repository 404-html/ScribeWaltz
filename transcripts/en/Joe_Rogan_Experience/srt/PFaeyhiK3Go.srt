1
00:00:00,650 --> 00:00:01,960
And she had a real job.

2
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:06,710
Fuck.

3
00:00:06,710 --> 00:00:07,340
Oh No,

4
00:00:07,340 --> 00:00:08,173
no.

5
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:12,990
Joe Rogan Experience Day.

6
00:00:13,350 --> 00:00:16,000
Joe Rogan podcast by night all day.

7
00:00:28,940 --> 00:00:32,810
Big City Watch.

8
00:00:57,080 --> 00:00:57,913
Oh Shit.

9
00:01:01,690 --> 00:01:02,330
Do that one.

10
00:01:02,330 --> 00:01:02,571
Yeah,

11
00:01:02,571 --> 00:01:03,404
that was crazy.

12
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:04,480
Oh,

13
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:05,430
that fucking song.

14
00:01:18,340 --> 00:01:19,173
Good Dude.

15
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:21,530
I'm three false.

16
00:01:21,890 --> 00:01:22,191
No,

17
00:01:22,191 --> 00:01:25,430
but I can tell you know what you're doing.

18
00:01:25,460 --> 00:01:26,293
It's cool.

19
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:27,230
It's nice to see

20
00:01:30,890 --> 00:01:32,180
you're hitting all the right shots.

21
00:01:33,030 --> 00:01:33,863
It's cool.

22
00:01:42,150 --> 00:01:42,970
I love the smell.

23
00:01:42,970 --> 00:01:45,100
The smell of what?

24
00:01:45,190 --> 00:01:46,040
The smell plot.

25
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:46,661
Oh yeah.

26
00:01:46,661 --> 00:01:47,750
I like the smell.

27
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:52,360
It's like I've always like not
been into the high that much,

28
00:01:52,420 --> 00:01:55,090
but I'd loved everything about the drug.

29
00:01:55,091 --> 00:01:56,870
Like the leaves growing yet.

30
00:01:57,160 --> 00:01:57,993
Yeah,

31
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,080
rolling joints.

32
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:00,440
I mean when I was younger.

33
00:02:00,850 --> 00:02:01,683
Right.

34
00:02:03,450 --> 00:02:03,890
Yeah,

35
00:02:03,890 --> 00:02:04,723
like it.

36
00:02:05,770 --> 00:02:06,603
I'm a big fan.

37
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:09,990
I think it's just different.

38
00:02:11,070 --> 00:02:12,320
No ball look perfect in one.

39
00:02:21,330 --> 00:02:22,163
Cool.

40
00:02:22,220 --> 00:02:22,450
Cool.

41
00:02:22,450 --> 00:02:23,910
Seeing someone who knows how to play pool.

42
00:02:25,610 --> 00:02:25,820
Yeah.

43
00:02:25,820 --> 00:02:30,470
I wish [inaudible] practice
with a couple logic Garcia,

44
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:32,080
but he lives kind of far.

45
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:34,990
I'd be happy to play with
you and what do you live?

46
00:02:36,420 --> 00:02:37,171
I'm right now,

47
00:02:37,171 --> 00:02:38,004
I'm living in

48
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:40,261
Yucaipa,

49
00:02:40,261 --> 00:02:40,861
California.

50
00:02:40,861 --> 00:02:41,670
Do you know what that is?

51
00:02:41,670 --> 00:02:42,503
No.

52
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:44,970
It's on the way to palm springs.

53
00:02:44,971 --> 00:02:46,160
It's kind of up in the house,

54
00:02:46,180 --> 00:02:47,013
in the mountains,

55
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:48,661
more of a mountain.

56
00:02:48,661 --> 00:02:49,540
He kind of vibe.

57
00:02:53,220 --> 00:02:54,130
What are I brought you out?

58
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:56,600
Um,

59
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:59,680
because he told me about the house and uh,

60
00:03:03,140 --> 00:03:03,973
I

61
00:03:05,330 --> 00:03:09,590
like the idea that I could fit
a regular pool table in there.

62
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:14,630
Isn't it all the high born
like three or four houses.

63
00:03:14,660 --> 00:03:17,650
I've never had one that had the
room that would accommodate up,

64
00:03:17,690 --> 00:03:18,710
want to have by nine.

65
00:03:19,940 --> 00:03:21,010
There's always a,

66
00:03:23,410 --> 00:03:23,900
so,

67
00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:24,400
you know,

68
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:25,150
just,

69
00:03:25,150 --> 00:03:25,983
I don't know what,

70
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:32,153
wow.

71
00:03:33,990 --> 00:03:34,280
Yeah,

72
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:35,140
that's huge for me,

73
00:03:35,141 --> 00:03:35,650
man.

74
00:03:35,650 --> 00:03:37,660
It's one of the things I
liked about this office.

75
00:03:37,870 --> 00:03:38,703
Okay.

76
00:03:43,490 --> 00:03:45,700
One of the things that I was
excited about what this office is,

77
00:03:45,730 --> 00:03:47,180
I knew there was space for a table.

78
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:49,580
I resisted for a while.

79
00:03:49,820 --> 00:03:50,500
Nice.

80
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:50,841
Get it.

81
00:03:50,841 --> 00:03:54,260
I'll just be fucking playing
all the time and I wasted,

82
00:03:54,261 --> 00:03:56,780
my life hasn't really been,

83
00:03:57,150 --> 00:03:59,470
this is a great table of
practice on the pocket.

84
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:00,313
So yeah.

85
00:04:00,380 --> 00:04:00,890
No,

86
00:04:00,890 --> 00:04:01,520
I enjoy it.

87
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:02,960
I think it's changed my game a little.

88
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:07,410
Do be running out like
crazy on your diamond.

89
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:07,921
Yeah.

90
00:04:07,921 --> 00:04:11,130
Well I saw also feel like I'm
hitting balls a lot more gently.

91
00:04:11,750 --> 00:04:16,140
I notice that some of the
shots you good job making the,

92
00:04:19,570 --> 00:04:20,320
it was just um,

93
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:22,990
it requires more of you
because they're so tight.

94
00:04:26,350 --> 00:04:28,770
I wasn't sure if that would be good
or if it'd be annoying after awhile,

95
00:04:28,860 --> 00:04:30,010
but I definitely think it's good.

96
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:38,333
Go Buddy.

97
00:04:39,590 --> 00:04:39,861
Yeah.

98
00:04:39,861 --> 00:04:43,760
It just requires acquires
you to concentrate more.

99
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:44,901
Is it pockets?

100
00:04:44,901 --> 00:04:45,280
You're stuck.

101
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:46,113
Rude.

102
00:04:57,810 --> 00:04:59,540
We've got to make the right choices too.

103
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:29,273
Yeah.

104
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:34,440
How do you plan on 10 ball?

105
00:05:34,441 --> 00:05:35,590
Do you play the back house?

106
00:05:36,590 --> 00:05:37,281
We get 10 ball.

107
00:05:37,281 --> 00:05:38,210
That's not supposed to count.

108
00:05:39,590 --> 00:05:41,510
I think it's supposed to be called pocket.

109
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:43,130
Where did this play goes?

110
00:05:43,140 --> 00:05:43,630
Goes through.

111
00:05:43,630 --> 00:05:44,463
I like slot.

112
00:05:44,630 --> 00:05:45,463
Okay.

113
00:05:47,090 --> 00:05:48,650
I think like 10 ball.

114
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:51,200
I got to show you the shot that this guy,

115
00:05:51,740 --> 00:05:54,980
he showed me something
and I didn't hear it.

116
00:05:55,020 --> 00:05:55,320
CJ,

117
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:55,530
why?

118
00:05:55,530 --> 00:05:56,750
They talk about it for a long time,

119
00:05:56,751 --> 00:05:57,930
but I've tried it and it's,

120
00:05:58,020 --> 00:05:59,240
it's so bizarre to me.

121
00:06:00,260 --> 00:06:01,093
I'll show you.

122
00:06:01,150 --> 00:06:01,983
I just

123
00:06:03,670 --> 00:06:04,503
get

124
00:07:04,020 --> 00:07:04,900
such a nice job.

125
00:07:19,150 --> 00:07:23,840
I think that's one of the coolest things
about is the fact that you're trying to

126
00:07:23,841 --> 00:07:28,841
control just a couple revolutions
out a ball like that little bit off.

127
00:07:29,060 --> 00:07:30,760
That's what makes the game so insane.

128
00:07:30,810 --> 00:07:31,643
Yeah.

129
00:07:31,940 --> 00:07:33,800
If you were just a little
bit further than that,

130
00:07:35,180 --> 00:07:36,380
it was a perfect shot.

131
00:07:43,090 --> 00:07:46,340
Reckless.

132
00:07:49,230 --> 00:07:51,690
You don't have to look this year,

133
00:07:55,550 --> 00:07:56,383
did street,

134
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:10,960
do you know what Max,

135
00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:11,660
I believe?

136
00:08:11,660 --> 00:08:12,493
Oh yeah.

137
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:18,560
The guy that'd be a good
guy to get instructions from

138
00:08:20,870 --> 00:08:21,703
good.

139
00:08:22,220 --> 00:08:23,053
Helped me a lot.

140
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:26,930
Get a lot of knowledge.

141
00:08:27,010 --> 00:08:27,160
Well,

142
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:28,780
his fundamentals are so perfect.

143
00:08:28,790 --> 00:08:29,510
Yeah.

144
00:08:29,510 --> 00:08:31,120
The way he holds a cue,

145
00:08:33,060 --> 00:08:35,150
he describes it as the reputation,

146
00:08:35,170 --> 00:08:35,500
you know,

147
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:36,470
the reputation,

148
00:08:37,210 --> 00:08:38,043
but he says,

149
00:08:39,610 --> 00:08:40,010
you know,

150
00:08:40,010 --> 00:08:42,170
the same amount of time between shots.

151
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:43,220
Yeah.

152
00:08:43,220 --> 00:08:43,390
Good.
