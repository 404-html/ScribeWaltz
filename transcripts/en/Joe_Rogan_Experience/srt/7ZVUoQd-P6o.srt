00:06:15,171 --> 00:06:15,891
you can do that.

168
00:06:15,891 --> 00:06:20,891
But if you're a guy out there on the move
and maybe perhaps a mixing in some not

169
00:06:24,201 --> 00:06:25,640
so healthy food with,

170
00:06:25,641 --> 00:06:26,330
uh,

171
00:06:26,330 --> 00:06:26,740
with,

172
00:06:26,740 --> 00:06:27,200
you know,

173
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:30,650
fresh fruits and vegetables
and lean meats and proteins,

174
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:31,751
sometimes you,

175
00:06:31,751 --> 00:06:31,980
uh,

176
00:06:31,980 --> 00:06:34,670
you need to supplement and one
of the best ways to stop them.

177
00:06:34,671 --> 00:06:38,120
And is this earth grown nutrients package.

178
00:06:38,270 --> 00:06:43,270
Everything we sell it on it is stuff
that either I use or Aubrey uses my,

179
00:06:44,891 --> 00:06:45,390
um,

180
00:06:45,390 --> 00:06:49,670
my partner in on it and things that we
have found that we have researched and

181
00:06:49,671 --> 00:06:52,190
things that we have found that
there's science behind it.

182
00:06:52,191 --> 00:06:57,191
If you go to any of the products like
especially the things like Alpha brain,

183
00:06:57,261 --> 00:07:02,261
which is a cognitive enhancing nutritive
nutritional combination of things that

184
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:11,680
have all been shown to benefit memory
with a nootropic is for folks who don't

185
00:07:13,130 --> 00:07:15,230
not familiar with the term nootropics,

186
00:07:15,231 --> 00:07:19,580
are essentially nutrients that are,

187
00:07:19,610 --> 00:07:22,160
that have been found to
enhance cognitive function.

188
00:07:22,370 --> 00:07:26,710
And what that means is the
all the building blocks
for human neurotransmitters

189
00:07:26,950 --> 00:07:28,970
to building blocks and
enhance your memory.

190
00:07:29,470 --> 00:07:30,590
It can be very confusing,

191
00:07:30,980 --> 00:07:34,400
but if you go to [inaudible] dot com
and click on the Alpha brain link,

192
00:07:34,401 --> 00:07:37,490
there's actually a bunch
of science behind it,

193
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:38,930
a bunch of research behind it,

194
00:07:39,180 --> 00:07:39,420
uh,

195
00:07:39,420 --> 00:07:40,580
with references.

196
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:45,760
We actually have done our own clinically
based a double blind placebo study and

197
00:07:47,150 --> 00:07:51,440
those results are available at [inaudible]
dot com and more studies are ongoing.

198
00:07:51,730 --> 00:07:53,240
It's all really fascinating stuff.

199
00:07:53,241 --> 00:07:55,650
Cutting edge nutrition and um,

200
00:07:56,630 --> 00:07:57,800
controversial in a sense,

201
00:07:57,801 --> 00:08:01,190
but noncontroversial in the fact that
we give you a 100 percent money back

202
00:08:01,191 --> 00:08:02,024
guarantee.

203
00:08:02,060 --> 00:08:04,850
Ninety days on the first 30 pills,

204
00:08:05,030 --> 00:08:06,890
you have a 100 percent
money back guarantee.

205
00:08:06,891 --> 00:08:08,360
You don't even have to
return your product.

206
00:08:08,361 --> 00:08:10,910
He just have to say this stuff's bullshit.

207
00:08:11,390 --> 00:08:11,940
And uh,

208
00:08:11,940 --> 00:08:12,920
then you get your money back.

209
00:08:12,980 --> 00:08:13,400
That's crazy.

210
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:17,420
I didn't know that a is going naked or
not having like the colored pills anymore

211
00:08:17,570 --> 00:08:19,190
because they're getting
rid of the dyes and stuff.

212
00:08:19,191 --> 00:08:20,330
That's actually on the pills.

213
00:08:20,530 --> 00:08:21,030
Yeah,

214
00:08:21,030 --> 00:08:21,260
yeah.

215
00:08:21,260 --> 00:08:22,430
We did that a while ago.

216
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:23,293
But um,

217
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:24,890
it's also because people like,

218
00:08:25,070 --> 00:08:26,570
they look like when you look at it,

219
00:08:26,571 --> 00:08:27,430
it looks like a,

220
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:28,431
well,

221
00:08:28,431 --> 00:08:28,610
yeah.

222
00:08:28,610 --> 00:08:29,210
Well Green.

223
00:08:29,210 --> 00:08:31,550
And it was green and yellow and
it doesn't look like ecstasy.

224
00:08:31,551 --> 00:08:34,520
It looks like I'm like a pharmaceutical,

225
00:08:34,740 --> 00:08:35,270
you know,

226
00:08:35,270 --> 00:08:36,500
it looks like something
that you would get.

227
00:08:37,310 --> 00:08:39,050
It doesn't look like
earth grown nutrients.

228
00:08:39,051 --> 00:08:40,490
It doesn't look like it's healthy.

229
00:08:41,090 --> 00:08:41,923
I Dunno.

230
00:08:42,090 --> 00:08:42,923
Just colors,

231
00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:44,533
gelatin,

232
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:45,770
gelatin and colors.

233
00:08:46,010 --> 00:08:46,341
Anyway,

234
00:08:46,341 --> 00:08:47,390
go to [inaudible] dot com.

235
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:51,710
Use the code word Rogan and save 10
percent off any and all supplements.

236
00:08:51,730 --> 00:08:54,120
I alluded yesterday that we've
got some big news coming out.

237
00:08:54,140 --> 00:08:55,710
It's going to be awhile
before announced it,

238
00:08:55,711 --> 00:08:58,110
but we have big plans at,

239
00:08:58,111 --> 00:08:59,410
on it in.

240
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:01,290
I can't tell you too much about it,

241
00:09:01,291 --> 00:09:02,124
but uh,

242
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:02,911
it'll be,

243
00:09:02,911 --> 00:09:03,271
uh,

244
00:09:03,271 --> 00:09:04,200
about um,

245
00:09:04,830 --> 00:09:05,430
about uh,

246
00:09:05,430 --> 00:09:07,500
mixed martial arts is what
it's going to be about.

247
00:09:07,501 --> 00:09:08,430
And it's going to be about,

248
00:09:08,431 --> 00:09:08,920
um,

249
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:10,290
I'll just tell you it's
about training center.

250
00:09:10,740 --> 00:09:10,990
Alright,

251
00:09:10,990 --> 00:09:11,580
there it is.

252
00:09:11,580 --> 00:09:12,670
That's it on a Dotcom.

253
00:09:12,780 --> 00:09:13,591
Use a codeword Rogan.

254
00:09:13,591 --> 00:09:15,480
Save 10 percent off any
and all supplements.

255
00:09:15,750 --> 00:09:18,720
Joel Salitan is here and we're going
to talk to him and we're going to learn

256
00:09:18,721 --> 00:09:19,554
some shit.

257
00:09:21,770 --> 00:09:24,510
The Joe Rogan experience

258
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:27,290
podcast by night.

259
00:09:29,620 --> 00:09:30,580
A sure sign,

260
00:09:30,581 --> 00:09:31,390
sir,

261
00:09:31,390 --> 00:09:32,290
that we live in a mad,

262
00:09:32,291 --> 00:09:37,120
mad world is when a person has seen ideas
and he comes across as a revolutionary

263
00:09:37,540 --> 00:09:42,540
and I have Joel Saltz and for folks
who don't know as an American farmer or

264
00:09:43,050 --> 00:09:48,050
lecture or you're an author and
your approach to farming is,

265
00:09:49,350 --> 00:09:51,640
it's so natural and so normal.

266
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:52,810
And so,

267
00:09:52,811 --> 00:09:53,230
uh,

268
00:09:53,230 --> 00:09:56,590
in my opinion noncontroversial that it's,

269
00:09:56,600 --> 00:10:00,880
it's quite fascinating that in
this day and age with this mad,

270
00:10:00,881 --> 00:10:05,710
mad world of factory farming and pumping
these animals full of hormones and

271
00:10:05,711 --> 00:10:07,690
chemicals and antibiotics,

272
00:10:07,691 --> 00:10:12,691
that your approach has sort
of revolutionized a lot
of the ideas that people

273
00:10:15,851 --> 00:10:16,810
have about farming.

274
00:10:17,530 --> 00:10:22,150
I think it's a real sign that
there's something wrong with us.

275
00:10:22,450 --> 00:10:26,620
When I watch your methods and I've seen
your videos and I've heard you talk on

276
00:10:26,621 --> 00:10:27,040
it,

277
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:29,440
it seems like no nonsense.

278
00:10:29,790 --> 00:10:33,400
It seems like it seems normal.

279
00:10:33,401 --> 00:10:34,900
It seems like common sense,

280
00:10:34,901 --> 00:10:36,400
it seems like old knowledge,

281
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:41,680
but yet you're looked at as some
sort of a wild man out there.

282
00:10:42,310 --> 00:10:43,143
A lunatic.

283
00:10:43,900 --> 00:10:44,571
You're a lunatic.

284
00:10:44,571 --> 00:10:45,650
You're nice to your animals.

285
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:46,491
Yeah,

286
00:10:46,491 --> 00:10:47,031
we are.

287
00:10:47,031 --> 00:10:47,301
I mean,

288
00:10:47,301 --> 00:10:48,134
you know,

289
00:10:48,290 --> 00:10:48,921
people say,

290
00:10:48,921 --> 00:10:49,071
Oh,

291
00:10:49,071 --> 00:10:50,150
you're so clever,

292
00:10:50,151 --> 00:10:50,421
you know,

293
00:10:50,421 --> 00:10:51,590
how do you come up with this?

294
00:10:51,591 --> 00:10:53,900
And My response is that,

295
00:10:54,530 --> 00:10:55,363
uh,

296
00:10:55,580 --> 00:10:56,720
this is not new,

297
00:10:56,750 --> 00:10:57,240
you know,

298
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:57,610
uh,

299
00:10:57,610 --> 00:10:58,580
I mean it takes,

300
00:10:58,590 --> 00:10:59,990
like take just for example,

301
00:11:01,610 --> 00:11:02,540
our culture,

302
00:11:02,580 --> 00:11:02,810
right?

303
00:11:02,810 --> 00:11:03,290
I mean our,

304
00:11:03,290 --> 00:11:03,981
our experts,

305
00:11:03,981 --> 00:11:04,221
you know,

306
00:11:04,221 --> 00:11:07,880
our Usda and are a usda,

307
00:11:07,970 --> 00:11:09,050
our expert tea.

308
00:11:09,100 --> 00:11:09,750
Yeah.

309
00:11:09,750 --> 00:11:10,580
Um,

310
00:11:10,580 --> 00:11:10,850
you know,

311
00:11:10,850 --> 00:11:13,100
they don't think that
animals are supposed to move.

312
00:11:14,220 --> 00:11:15,053
I mean,

313
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:17,450
but animals are supposed to move.

314
00:11:17,570 --> 00:11:18,403
I mean that's like,

315
00:11:18,980 --> 00:11:19,970
that's like a fundamental,

316
00:11:19,971 --> 00:11:20,930
natural pattern.

317
00:11:21,530 --> 00:11:22,820
And so yeah,

318
00:11:22,860 --> 00:11:23,990
if you pause it,

319
00:11:24,050 --> 00:11:24,470
oh,

320
00:11:24,470 --> 00:11:28,500
animals were supposed to move will
then a whole series of things happen,

321
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:29,000
you know,

322
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:29,833
from,

323
00:11:29,910 --> 00:11:30,230
you know,

324
00:11:30,230 --> 00:11:31,460
control mechanisms,

325
00:11:31,461 --> 00:11:32,330
shelter,

326
00:11:32,490 --> 00:11:32,841
you know,

327
00:11:32,841 --> 00:11:33,980
water delivery systems,

328
00:11:33,981 --> 00:11:35,510
all sorts of things happen to happen.

329
00:11:36,050 --> 00:11:37,120
If you just pause it,

330
00:11:37,121 --> 00:11:37,970
something as,

331
00:11:38,060 --> 00:11:41,780
as intuitively simple as on our farm,

332
00:11:41,781 --> 00:11:42,860
animals are going to move.

333
00:11:44,270 --> 00:11:45,103
It's amazing.

334
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:46,160
So you know,

335
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:47,210
if animals are going to move,

336
00:11:47,510 --> 00:11:48,680
you have to keep them home,

337
00:11:49,220 --> 00:11:52,490
you have to be able to move them in
the right place at the right time.

338
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:57,640
So then you have to have portable control
mechanisms or you got to keep them

339
00:11:57,970 --> 00:11:58,511
comfortable.

340
00:11:58,511 --> 00:12:02,670
So then you have portable
shade mechanisms and uh,

341
00:12:02,860 --> 00:12:04,120
you got to u of m water,

342
00:12:04,121 --> 00:12:07,810
so we've got to be able to
have portable water and um,

343
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:13,200
and so all these things necessarily flow
from just something as basic as animals

344
00:12:15,701 --> 00:12:16,420
move.

345
00:12:16,420 --> 00:12:17,290
Find it fascinating.

346
00:12:17,350 --> 00:12:19,720
It is fascinating
because most people have,

347
00:12:19,780 --> 00:12:20,270
they've,

348
00:12:20,270 --> 00:12:24,460
they've gone the opposite way with what
they've said is we don't want animals to

349
00:12:24,461 --> 00:12:25,060
move.

350
00:12:25,060 --> 00:12:26,110
So let's contain it.

351
00:12:26,111 --> 00:12:26,944
Right?

352
00:12:27,090 --> 00:12:27,361
Right.

353
00:12:27,361 --> 00:12:27,571
I mean,

354
00:12:27,571 --> 00:12:28,060
so the,

355
00:12:28,060 --> 00:12:30,660
the industrial system is predicated on,

356
00:12:30,930 --> 00:12:31,171
you know,

357
00:12:31,171 --> 00:12:31,291
we,

358
00:12:31,291 --> 00:12:33,050
we lock all these animals up in a,

359
00:12:33,250 --> 00:12:34,920
in a confinement facility,

360
00:12:35,430 --> 00:12:38,070
a 15,000 chickens in a house,

361
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:39,020
you know,

362
00:12:39,020 --> 00:12:43,050
non laying hens and a
16 by 22 inch cubicle.

363
00:12:43,710 --> 00:12:44,131
Uh,

364
00:12:44,131 --> 00:12:49,131
I mean there's not enough room even
to sit down cattle in feedlots,

365
00:12:49,890 --> 00:12:52,200
pigs in confinement houses.

366
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:54,300
And we'd do the same thing
kind of in our plants.

367
00:12:54,310 --> 00:12:54,960
I mean,

368
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:58,380
that's the next thing then is in nature,

369
00:12:59,190 --> 00:13:01,440
there are no monocultures,

370
00:13:01,441 --> 00:13:02,940
there are no monitor species.

371
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:04,680
Anywhere you go in nature,

372
00:13:05,430 --> 00:13:06,600
no matter where you'd hike,

373
00:13:06,630 --> 00:13:08,820
there's going to be at least two species.

374
00:13:09,060 --> 00:13:11,490
You're going to encounter multiple things.

375
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:12,353
In fact,

376
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:16,800
you're going to counter animals
and plants in proximity.

377
00:13:16,860 --> 00:13:17,790
Amazing.

378
00:13:18,620 --> 00:13:21,630
It's not going to be
fields of animal lists,

379
00:13:21,950 --> 00:13:24,960
wheat or fields of
animalistic strawberries.

380
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:27,540
And then over here the
animals can find in a,

381
00:13:27,870 --> 00:13:28,200
you know,

382
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:31,110
a little itty bitty building,

383
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:34,770
stinking up the neighborhood
instead in nature.

384
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:38,550
These things are actually proximate
and they're actually symbiotic.

385
00:13:38,551 --> 00:13:39,070
I mean,

386
00:13:39,070 --> 00:13:42,570
they actually have a lot of
synergistic functions to each other.

387
00:13:42,810 --> 00:13:47,130
I found it fascinating that
you w when you raise your pigs,

388
00:13:47,190 --> 00:13:48,020
you,

389
00:13:48,020 --> 00:13:50,580
you call them a wood finish,

390
00:13:50,581 --> 00:13:51,570
forest finished.

391
00:13:52,210 --> 00:13:53,043
Yeah.

392
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:54,670
We call them a,

393
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:55,760
you know,

394
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:57,350
a pasture finished or,

395
00:13:57,400 --> 00:13:58,221
or acorn.

396
00:13:58,221 --> 00:13:59,570
Glen's a,

397
00:13:59,571 --> 00:14:00,800
we call them Glen's,

398
00:14:00,910 --> 00:14:01,250
you know,

399
00:14:01,250 --> 00:14:03,350
for the old leprechauns,

400
00:14:03,370 --> 00:14:03,760
you know,

401
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:08,660
lurking in the plan and the
forest just has a nice ring to it.

402
00:14:09,350 --> 00:14:10,183
But uh,

403
00:14:10,190 --> 00:14:10,461
yeah,

404
00:14:10,461 --> 00:14:10,621
we,

405
00:14:10,621 --> 00:14:10,970
we,

406
00:14:10,970 --> 00:14:12,200
we use electric fence.

407
00:14:13,640 --> 00:14:14,660
This is not,

408
00:14:14,940 --> 00:14:15,560
you know,

409
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:16,550
a luddite.

410
00:14:17,180 --> 00:14:19,220
This is not anti technology stuff.

411
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:22,940
What we're doing is using pigs.

412
00:14:23,030 --> 00:14:25,820
All pigs have four wheel drive and uh,

413
00:14:26,180 --> 00:14:26,601
uh,

414
00:14:26,601 --> 00:14:27,434
they,

415
00:14:27,470 --> 00:14:29,420
they like to disturb places.

416
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:30,081
I mean,

417
00:14:30,081 --> 00:14:30,261
you know,

418
00:14:30,261 --> 00:14:35,261
they have a great big bow on the end of
their face called the nose and so all

419
00:14:37,431 --> 00:14:42,431
we're doing is taking the way buffalo and
fire and predators used to move across

420
00:14:44,121 --> 00:14:45,480
the landscape with this,

421
00:14:45,610 --> 00:14:45,900
you know,

422
00:14:45,900 --> 00:14:47,390
with periodic disturbance.

423
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:49,670
We don't have buffalo anymore,

424
00:14:49,671 --> 00:14:50,780
we don't have the fire,

425
00:14:50,781 --> 00:14:52,430
we don't have the wolves much.

426
00:14:52,970 --> 00:14:56,000
And so how do we create this disturbance,

427
00:14:56,060 --> 00:14:56,260
you know,

428
00:14:56,260 --> 00:14:57,093
this is a,

429
00:14:57,140 --> 00:15:01,400
this is a very important
ecological principle that,

430
00:15:01,700 --> 00:15:02,533
um,

431
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:08,080
that living organisms have to be
disturbed in order to have succession to

432
00:15:09,141 --> 00:15:09,974
another level.

433
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:11,121
You know,

434
00:15:11,121 --> 00:15:16,121
whether it's the pain that comes
from a exercise and if you want to,

435
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:19,640
if you want to be physically fit,

436
00:15:20,900 --> 00:15:22,250
you got to disturb your body,

437
00:15:22,251 --> 00:15:23,450
you got to get up off the couch.

438
00:15:23,451 --> 00:15:25,670
Potato and ecology is the same way.

439
00:15:25,700 --> 00:15:27,080
It needs to be disturbed.

440
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:28,273
And so,

441
00:15:28,530 --> 00:15:28,780
you know,

442
00:15:28,780 --> 00:15:33,530
actually the ecology is used to having
a lot of disturbance factors on it,

443
00:15:33,531 --> 00:15:35,330
disturbance and then rest disturbance.

444
00:15:35,331 --> 00:15:36,164
And then rest,

445
00:15:36,470 --> 00:15:41,470
and so we use high tech electric fencing
to be able to move these pigs around in

446
00:15:41,721 --> 00:15:42,291
these forests.

447
00:15:42,291 --> 00:15:45,780
Glen's from one little
section to another in a,

448
00:15:45,790 --> 00:15:49,430
in a kind of rapid rotation
so that we have very,

449
00:15:49,510 --> 00:15:50,030
um,

450
00:15:50,030 --> 00:15:55,030
intense disturbance and then a long
period of rest in intense disturbance and

451
00:15:55,510 --> 00:15:56,150
long fraser.

452
00:15:56,150 --> 00:15:59,000
And what that does is the
pigs then go in and they,

453
00:15:59,180 --> 00:16:02,240
they till they eat bugs
that would affect the trees.

454
00:16:02,450 --> 00:16:05,270
They route out starchy weedy species,

455
00:16:05,271 --> 00:16:06,104
things like that.

456
00:16:06,710 --> 00:16:07,543
And um,

457
00:16:08,420 --> 00:16:09,050
eat a lot,

458
00:16:09,050 --> 00:16:10,850
eat a lot of goodies to get fresh air.

459
00:16:10,851 --> 00:16:11,720
They get exercise,

460
00:16:11,721 --> 00:16:16,721
sunshine and a and are able to
fully express their pigness and uh,

461
00:16:17,940 --> 00:16:18,230
and,

462
00:16:18,230 --> 00:16:23,230
and what you end up within
is an incredibly nutrient
dense product as opposed to

463
00:16:25,611 --> 00:16:26,301
a white meat,

464
00:16:26,301 --> 00:16:28,550
flabby product like out of the industry.

465
00:16:28,970 --> 00:16:33,970
And the other thing is that you now have
a whole new bunch of species that have

466
00:16:35,901 --> 00:16:40,901
germinated and sprouted in this disturbed
a environment is disturbed soil.

467
00:16:41,901 --> 00:16:42,740
And you actually,

468
00:16:43,700 --> 00:16:47,930
you actually capture more solar energy
than you would with just leaves and

469
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:49,910
sterile forest bottom.

470
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:50,741
So the,

471
00:16:50,741 --> 00:16:51,840
the actual product,

472
00:16:51,841 --> 00:16:54,320
that pig itself would be
more like a wild pig then?

473
00:16:54,710 --> 00:16:54,951
Yeah,

474
00:16:54,951 --> 00:16:55,850
that's exactly right.

475
00:16:55,851 --> 00:16:56,301
In fact,

476
00:16:56,301 --> 00:16:57,020
we've had a,

477
00:16:57,020 --> 00:17:00,160
we supply about 50 restaurants and um,

478
00:17:00,380 --> 00:17:05,380
we've had chefs do displacement tests
where they'll get like industry p,

479
00:17:05,690 --> 00:17:06,141
industry,

480
00:17:06,141 --> 00:17:06,800
pork,

481
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:07,670
and our pork,

482
00:17:07,820 --> 00:17:12,380
and using their very carefully
calibrated scales they can make,

483
00:17:12,410 --> 00:17:12,630
you know,

484
00:17:12,630 --> 00:17:16,940
two blocks of meat that are
exactly the same weight,

485
00:17:17,570 --> 00:17:19,460
put them in a pan of water,

486
00:17:19,461 --> 00:17:24,461
measure the displacement and our pork
displaces less water per pound than the

487
00:17:27,831 --> 00:17:28,790
industrial park.

488
00:17:28,850 --> 00:17:29,683
What does that mean?

489
00:17:29,780 --> 00:17:29,961
Well,

490
00:17:29,961 --> 00:17:33,770
what it means is that
the tissue is stronger.

491
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:35,233
In other words,

492
00:17:35,270 --> 00:17:35,780
there is,

493
00:17:35,780 --> 00:17:38,930
there is more weight per cubic inch,

494
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:40,970
which,

495
00:17:40,970 --> 00:17:41,730
which means it's,

496
00:17:41,730 --> 00:17:43,190
it's better formed.

497
00:17:43,210 --> 00:17:46,160
It's why would we call that?

498
00:17:46,161 --> 00:17:47,630
We call that muscle tone.

499
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:48,231
Oh,

500
00:17:48,231 --> 00:17:48,531
I see,

501
00:17:48,531 --> 00:17:48,771
I see.

502
00:17:48,771 --> 00:17:50,480
So they're denser fat,

503
00:17:50,510 --> 00:17:51,343
fat,

504
00:17:51,410 --> 00:17:53,090
and Flab.

505
00:17:53,590 --> 00:17:55,010
We can say Flab,

506
00:17:55,190 --> 00:17:56,023
um,

507
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:56,540
is,

508
00:17:56,540 --> 00:17:57,080
is,

509
00:17:57,080 --> 00:17:59,780
is a lot more volume per pound.

510
00:18:01,220 --> 00:18:04,720
If you jump into a swimming
pool and you're really muscled,

511
00:18:04,721 --> 00:18:05,450
toned,

512
00:18:05,450 --> 00:18:06,920
sometimes you have trouble floating.

513
00:18:08,210 --> 00:18:09,030
But if you're a,

514
00:18:09,030 --> 00:18:09,400
you know,

515
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:10,640
a fat person,

516
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:11,371
you know,

517
00:18:11,371 --> 00:18:14,120
you can float in atwater
water like a blimp all day,

518
00:18:14,121 --> 00:18:14,331
you know,

519
00:18:14,331 --> 00:18:15,380
it just works fine.

520
00:18:15,740 --> 00:18:16,573
And so,

521
00:18:16,610 --> 00:18:17,300
so,

522
00:18:17,300 --> 00:18:17,710
you know,

523
00:18:17,710 --> 00:18:19,040
a density,

524
00:18:19,100 --> 00:18:24,100
muscle tone and density can be
measured with a displacement tests.

525
00:18:24,730 --> 00:18:25,600
That's fascinating.

526
00:18:25,601 --> 00:18:28,900
So I'm this much more nutrient dense.

527
00:18:28,930 --> 00:18:29,630
Absolutely.

528
00:18:29,630 --> 00:18:29,811
Is,

529
00:18:29,811 --> 00:18:30,070
is,

530
00:18:30,070 --> 00:18:31,750
is it preferred by these chefs?

531
00:18:31,810 --> 00:18:32,643
Oh,

532
00:18:33,790 --> 00:18:34,511
absolutely.

533
00:18:34,511 --> 00:18:35,230
I mean that's why.

534
00:18:35,230 --> 00:18:36,550
That's why they get it.

535
00:18:36,820 --> 00:18:41,440
And the end result is
that you actually get,

536
00:18:41,830 --> 00:18:45,220
you actually get more nutrition
per pound because it's,

537
00:18:45,250 --> 00:18:45,550
you know,

538
00:18:45,550 --> 00:18:46,383
it's denser.

539
00:18:46,930 --> 00:18:51,930
I smoked a wild hand for the first time
this past week and it was a fascinating

540
00:18:52,870 --> 00:18:55,990
how much different it
tasted than a regular ham.

541
00:18:56,290 --> 00:18:57,340
So your,

542
00:18:57,370 --> 00:19:00,250
your Hams would be similar to that,

543
00:19:00,340 --> 00:19:00,670
right?

544
00:19:00,670 --> 00:19:01,503
That's right.

545
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:02,281
Darker,

546
00:19:02,281 --> 00:19:02,580
yeah.

547
00:19:02,580 --> 00:19:02,950
Uh,

548
00:19:02,950 --> 00:19:03,240
you know,

549
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:04,680
when the industry says pork,

550
00:19:04,681 --> 00:19:04,831
you know,

551
00:19:04,831 --> 00:19:06,300
remember they had the campaign for what,

552
00:19:06,301 --> 00:19:06,990
10 years,

553
00:19:06,990 --> 00:19:07,231
pork,

554
00:19:07,231 --> 00:19:08,130
the other white meat.

555
00:19:08,460 --> 00:19:10,080
I think now it's um,

556
00:19:10,980 --> 00:19:13,140
what's the new that they
abandoned that slogan,

557
00:19:13,141 --> 00:19:13,974
now it's a,

558
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:14,700
uh,

559
00:19:14,700 --> 00:19:15,470
something like,

560
00:19:15,470 --> 00:19:15,810
you know,

561
00:19:15,810 --> 00:19:17,430
get with it or something like that.

562
00:19:18,090 --> 00:19:18,923
Be inspired,

563
00:19:18,990 --> 00:19:20,590
be inspired by it.

564
00:19:20,610 --> 00:19:21,271
That's exactly what,

565
00:19:21,271 --> 00:19:23,220
being an animal that lives in a box.

566
00:19:23,470 --> 00:19:23,800
How,

567
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:24,340
what?

568
00:19:24,340 --> 00:19:24,700
Yeah.

569
00:19:24,700 --> 00:19:25,180
So,

570
00:19:25,180 --> 00:19:25,630
so,

571
00:19:25,630 --> 00:19:25,811
uh,

572
00:19:25,811 --> 00:19:26,370
disease that.

573
00:19:26,370 --> 00:19:26,551
Yeah.

574
00:19:26,551 --> 00:19:27,510
So you know,

575
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:27,750
my,

576
00:19:27,750 --> 00:19:28,710
my father in law,

577
00:19:28,740 --> 00:19:30,830
he's in his eighties now and you know,

578
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:34,650
they used to raise hogs on their farm
and it's interesting they built there.

579
00:19:34,651 --> 00:19:39,651
They had a kind of a shed shelter where
the pigs would go in and eat like sour

580
00:19:40,101 --> 00:19:44,850
milk and whey and leftovers
from the milk about 20 cows.

581
00:19:44,851 --> 00:19:46,290
And so they'd always be leftovers.

582
00:19:47,010 --> 00:19:48,000
And the pigs go in there.

583
00:19:48,060 --> 00:19:53,060
Well they actually built it with the sil
two feet above the ground so the pigs

584
00:19:53,221 --> 00:19:58,221
had to jump up in there and that exercise
made their hams taste way better and

585
00:19:58,531 --> 00:19:58,690
it,

586
00:19:58,690 --> 00:20:01,770
and it increased oxygen
flow to their hands.

587
00:20:01,890 --> 00:20:05,490
So the meat was rose
colored rather than white.

588
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:07,410
And that,

589
00:20:07,410 --> 00:20:10,050
and that rose color indicates iron,

590
00:20:10,170 --> 00:20:11,010
hemoglobin,

591
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:11,873
iron.

592
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:12,713
So the,

593
00:20:12,870 --> 00:20:16,250
the exercise of jumping
in and the extra eye.

594
00:20:16,410 --> 00:20:19,170
I collect old ag books.

595
00:20:19,460 --> 00:20:21,090
Anything before 19 fifties,

596
00:20:21,091 --> 00:20:21,924
pretty good.

597
00:20:22,020 --> 00:20:23,970
After that it all went to pot.

598
00:20:24,570 --> 00:20:25,403
And uh,

599
00:20:25,830 --> 00:20:29,310
and so if you read any like old 19,

600
00:20:29,580 --> 00:20:30,061
10,

601
00:20:30,061 --> 00:20:30,541
19,

602
00:20:30,541 --> 00:20:31,080
20,

603
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:33,510
1900 a swine book,

604
00:20:33,870 --> 00:20:38,870
the first thing it'll say is exercise
exercise because the pork responds to that

605
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:44,430
oxygenation of the blood
and makes the meat a deep,

606
00:20:44,940 --> 00:20:47,100
a deep rich color,

607
00:20:47,110 --> 00:20:47,943
which indicates,

608
00:20:48,030 --> 00:20:48,340
you know,

609
00:20:48,340 --> 00:20:49,173
iron

610
00:20:49,190 --> 00:20:50,570
that is so fascinating.

611
00:20:50,571 --> 00:20:52,340
So this white meat is pork,

612
00:20:52,341 --> 00:20:52,761
the other white.

613
00:20:52,761 --> 00:20:54,650
What a crazy ad campaign that is.

614
00:20:54,830 --> 00:20:57,020
Of course it is based entirely on,

615
00:20:57,050 --> 00:20:57,370
on,

616
00:20:57,370 --> 00:20:58,220
on ignorance.

617
00:20:58,530 --> 00:20:59,363
Sure it is.

618
00:21:00,570 --> 00:21:01,650
Yes it is.

619
00:21:01,651 --> 00:21:01,891
I mean,

620
00:21:01,891 --> 00:21:02,671
the same thing as,

621
00:21:02,671 --> 00:21:02,851
you know,

622
00:21:02,851 --> 00:21:04,620
our chickens are vegetarians.

623
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:05,970
It's ridiculous.

624
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,170
Birds are omnivores.

625
00:21:07,320 --> 00:21:07,680
No,

626
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:10,980
I mean whoever saw robin refuse a worm,

627
00:21:11,010 --> 00:21:11,251
you know,

628
00:21:11,251 --> 00:21:13,050
I mean birds are omnivores.

629
00:21:13,290 --> 00:21:14,610
So this whole idea of,

630
00:21:14,660 --> 00:21:17,550
of a vegetarian fed chickens is just,

631
00:21:17,900 --> 00:21:19,110
doesn't be sick chickens.

632
00:21:19,170 --> 00:21:19,471
Yeah,

633
00:21:19,471 --> 00:21:19,850
it,

634
00:21:19,850 --> 00:21:20,160
it,

635
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:20,890
it makes you know,

636
00:21:20,890 --> 00:21:23,190
Pale nutrition,

637
00:21:23,250 --> 00:21:24,390
nutrient deficient egg.

638
00:21:24,790 --> 00:21:25,091
Yeah.

639
00:21:25,091 --> 00:21:27,220
There's a big difference
in the color of the eggs.

640
00:21:27,580 --> 00:21:28,510
I have chickens,

641
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:33,720
I have 13 chickens in my yard and my
wife and I have been doing that for the

642
00:21:35,260 --> 00:21:36,093
past year and a half now.

643
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:38,890
And it's amazing how much
better the eggs taste.

644
00:21:38,891 --> 00:21:41,290
It's amazing how much darker the Yolk is,

645
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:44,250
it's like a dark orange and uh,

646
00:21:44,260 --> 00:21:44,560
you know,

647
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:48,550
we have a big yard and we keep them and
we have a huge house built that's bigger

648
00:21:48,551 --> 00:21:49,301
than the studio,

649
00:21:49,301 --> 00:21:50,410
bigger than this room at least,

650
00:21:50,740 --> 00:21:53,740
and the chickens all live in there and
they have plenty of room to run around.

651
00:21:53,741 --> 00:21:55,540
And then Taj Mahal chicken house,

652
00:21:55,541 --> 00:21:59,680
it's a big chicken house and then we
opened the door and let them roam around

653
00:21:59,681 --> 00:22:03,760
the yard and pick up bugs
and worms and all that stuff.

654
00:22:03,761 --> 00:22:06,010
But they're chicken this expressed.

655
00:22:06,070 --> 00:22:06,903
That's a good way to.

656
00:22:06,940 --> 00:22:09,790
That's a good way to put it in our,

657
00:22:10,030 --> 00:22:11,800
in our country right now,

658
00:22:12,310 --> 00:22:13,750
in the industrial foods,

659
00:22:13,751 --> 00:22:14,501
I call it the,

660
00:22:14,501 --> 00:22:14,860
uh,

661
00:22:14,860 --> 00:22:19,480
the industrial corporate USDA fraternity,

662
00:22:21,610 --> 00:22:24,940
they don't view life as
fundamentally biological.

663
00:22:24,941 --> 00:22:27,820
They view life as
fundamentally mechanical.

664
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:32,890
That's the big difference between the
industrial food perspective and what I'll

665
00:22:32,891 --> 00:22:33,770
call a,

666
00:22:33,820 --> 00:22:34,500
a more,

667
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:35,130
um,

668
00:22:35,130 --> 00:22:37,330
a craft oriented food perspective.

669
00:22:37,660 --> 00:22:38,493
Is,

670
00:22:38,530 --> 00:22:43,530
is food fundamentally biological or
is it mechanical and they don't ask.

671
00:22:43,811 --> 00:22:44,021
I mean,

672
00:22:44,021 --> 00:22:47,650
I've never seen a research project
that starts with an umbrella,

673
00:22:47,850 --> 00:22:49,090
a supposition.

674
00:22:49,370 --> 00:22:50,203
Um,

675
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:51,220
let's,

676
00:22:51,220 --> 00:22:54,160
let's define what makes a
happy chicken or a happy pig,

677
00:22:54,161 --> 00:22:54,401
you know,

678
00:22:54,401 --> 00:22:56,620
it's all about how do we grow them faster,

679
00:22:56,621 --> 00:22:57,281
fat or bigger,

680
00:22:57,281 --> 00:22:58,114
cheaper,

681
00:22:58,240 --> 00:22:59,073
and uh,

682
00:22:59,500 --> 00:23:04,180
as if they're just inanimate piles
of protoplasm ics structure to be

683
00:23:04,510 --> 00:23:05,291
manipulated.

684
00:23:05,291 --> 00:23:05,681
However,

685
00:23:05,681 --> 00:23:07,960
cleverly Hubris can
imagine to manipulate them.

686
00:23:08,410 --> 00:23:11,770
And I would suggest that a
culture that views it's food,

687
00:23:11,771 --> 00:23:14,260
it's plant and an animals from,

688
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:16,540
from that kind of mechanistic,

689
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:18,310
manipulative standpoint,

690
00:23:19,090 --> 00:23:23,020
we'll view its people the same way
that other cultures the same way.

691
00:23:23,150 --> 00:23:24,140
That's a very good point.

692
00:23:24,141 --> 00:23:24,771
Both points.

693
00:23:24,771 --> 00:23:24,951
Yeah.

694
00:23:24,951 --> 00:23:25,790
Is a very good point.

695
00:23:26,120 --> 00:23:27,520
Do you think that your,

696
00:23:27,521 --> 00:23:27,970
your,

697
00:23:27,970 --> 00:23:29,970
your style of farming is,

698
00:23:29,980 --> 00:23:32,150
is that possible on a large scale?

699
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:34,840
That's my favorite question.

700
00:23:34,900 --> 00:23:35,210
Uh,

701
00:23:35,210 --> 00:23:39,670
know can we feed the world because
ultimately all of this is just a bunch of,

702
00:23:39,671 --> 00:23:40,810
is an exercise in,

703
00:23:40,811 --> 00:23:41,490
uh,

704
00:23:41,490 --> 00:23:41,770
you know,

705
00:23:41,770 --> 00:23:42,600
feel goodness,

706
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:42,780
you know,

707
00:23:42,780 --> 00:23:46,250
warm fuzziness unless it actually
does translate to feeding the world.

708
00:23:46,251 --> 00:23:46,571
So let,

709
00:23:46,571 --> 00:23:46,750
let,

710
00:23:46,750 --> 00:23:47,000
let,

711
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,520
let's take that and interrupt me anytime.

712
00:23:49,910 --> 00:23:51,950
I'm first of all,

713
00:23:52,580 --> 00:23:54,080
for the first time in human history,

714
00:23:54,081 --> 00:23:59,081
we're producing twice as much human edible
food as we need on the planet twice a

715
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:03,860
manage half of all human edible
food never gets eaten by a human.

716
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:06,620
That's the first time
that's ever happened,

717
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:07,700
which means,

718
00:24:07,700 --> 00:24:09,330
which means that if,

719
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:09,981
if you were,

720
00:24:09,981 --> 00:24:14,981
I could click our fingers
today and suddenly double
the earth's food production,

721
00:24:15,770 --> 00:24:17,900
not a single other
person would get a meal.

722
00:24:20,060 --> 00:24:21,980
Food people go hungry.

723
00:24:21,981 --> 00:24:23,630
Not because there's not enough food,

724
00:24:24,410 --> 00:24:28,160
but because of demographic problems,

725
00:24:28,161 --> 00:24:29,270
infrastructure problems,

726
00:24:29,271 --> 00:24:29,421
you know,

727
00:24:29,421 --> 00:24:30,440
there's not a road,

728
00:24:30,770 --> 00:24:31,603
um,

729
00:24:32,060 --> 00:24:32,510
you know,

730
00:24:32,510 --> 00:24:32,751
uh,

731
00:24:32,751 --> 00:24:33,110
um,

732
00:24:33,110 --> 00:24:35,630
cultural issues like in inner cities and,

733
00:24:35,750 --> 00:24:36,440
you know,

734
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:38,510
that had been taken over by drugs,

735
00:24:38,511 --> 00:24:39,560
may have an and,

736
00:24:39,630 --> 00:24:41,360
and gangs,

737
00:24:41,590 --> 00:24:41,810
uh,

738
00:24:41,810 --> 00:24:43,220
businesses don't want to go there.

739
00:24:43,250 --> 00:24:44,030
You know,

740
00:24:44,030 --> 00:24:45,470
people with integrity,

741
00:24:45,471 --> 00:24:46,520
food don't want to go there.

742
00:24:46,521 --> 00:24:47,300
And so,

743
00:24:47,300 --> 00:24:48,470
and so there's a,

744
00:24:48,970 --> 00:24:49,190
uh,

745
00:24:49,190 --> 00:24:51,320
there's a tremendous amount of waste.

746
00:24:51,321 --> 00:24:51,740
I mean,

747
00:24:51,740 --> 00:24:56,120
I was talking to a guy that just was
at a green bean factory in Zimbabwe.

748
00:24:56,121 --> 00:24:59,900
They were exporting to Europe and they
were taken in five tons a day and only

749
00:24:59,901 --> 00:25:00,800
shipping to tons.

750
00:25:00,801 --> 00:25:01,041
I says,

751
00:25:01,041 --> 00:25:02,310
what happened to us in three tons?

752
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:03,261
Well,

753
00:25:03,261 --> 00:25:04,011
they're crooked,

754
00:25:04,011 --> 00:25:04,701
they're too long,

755
00:25:04,701 --> 00:25:05,480
they're too short,

756
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:06,960
they've got a little
black spot that you know.

757
00:25:08,060 --> 00:25:08,893
And um,

758
00:25:09,250 --> 00:25:09,690
so,

759
00:25:09,690 --> 00:25:09,850
you know,

760
00:25:09,850 --> 00:25:10,683
so we're,

761
00:25:10,730 --> 00:25:11,430
we're waste,

762
00:25:11,430 --> 00:25:12,440
we're wasting a lot of food.

763
00:25:13,670 --> 00:25:14,503
Secondly,

764
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:20,440
there is a tremendous amount of land
that's not being used because we have a

765
00:25:20,451 --> 00:25:23,090
fundamentally segregated food system,

766
00:25:23,091 --> 00:25:24,680
not an integrated food system.

767
00:25:25,910 --> 00:25:26,511
So we,

768
00:25:26,511 --> 00:25:26,781
you know,

769
00:25:26,781 --> 00:25:28,760
we produce the food over here,

770
00:25:29,330 --> 00:25:30,163
but we,

771
00:25:30,500 --> 00:25:31,550
and we eat it over here.

772
00:25:31,551 --> 00:25:32,390
We feed it over here.

773
00:25:32,391 --> 00:25:33,650
We have the manure over here,

774
00:25:33,651 --> 00:25:34,484
you know,

775
00:25:34,670 --> 00:25:35,140
the,

776
00:25:35,140 --> 00:25:37,700
the old integrated system is no longer,

777
00:25:38,660 --> 00:25:39,990
there are $35,

778
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:45,000
million acres of lawn in the US and
$36 million acres housing and feeding

779
00:25:46,251 --> 00:25:47,420
recreational horses.

780
00:25:47,660 --> 00:25:49,340
That 71 million acres,

781
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:53,090
that's enough to feed the entire
us without a single farmer ranch.

782
00:25:54,250 --> 00:25:55,000
Wow.

783
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,550
So what this food that's going bad.

784
00:25:57,580 --> 00:26:01,180
So if we're making twice as
much food as people need,

785
00:26:01,540 --> 00:26:03,190
what is it?

786
00:26:03,191 --> 00:26:07,750
A matter of the food deteriorating too
quickly to get to people or it's never

787
00:26:07,751 --> 00:26:08,584
going to get to people.

788
00:26:08,870 --> 00:26:10,250
It's never going to get to people,

789
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:10,940
uh,

790
00:26:10,940 --> 00:26:11,211
you know,

791
00:26:11,211 --> 00:26:11,510
go,

792
00:26:11,510 --> 00:26:16,510
go by the back door of any supermarket
produce department and you will see,

793
00:26:17,450 --> 00:26:17,721
you know,

794
00:26:17,721 --> 00:26:22,220
dumpsters full of spoil
stuff at one of the reasons.

795
00:26:22,550 --> 00:26:22,791
I mean,

796
00:26:22,791 --> 00:26:23,750
there are numerous reasons.

797
00:26:23,751 --> 00:26:24,530
There are,

798
00:26:24,530 --> 00:26:26,180
there are residue problems,

799
00:26:26,181 --> 00:26:27,020
for example,

800
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:27,561
you know,

801
00:26:27,561 --> 00:26:28,394
a dairy that,

802
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:31,430
that accidentally dumped
some antibiotic for example.

803
00:26:31,730 --> 00:26:35,510
And then it takes a whole tractor
trailer load of milk that's common,

804
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:36,673
that's common.

805
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:37,993
Um,

806
00:26:38,570 --> 00:26:40,880
you have a cosmetic issues,

807
00:26:41,780 --> 00:26:42,260
you know,

808
00:26:42,260 --> 00:26:46,000
a piece of fruit that has
one little blemish throwaway,

809
00:26:46,570 --> 00:26:47,403
um,

810
00:26:47,990 --> 00:26:48,460
the,

811
00:26:48,460 --> 00:26:49,293
the long,

812
00:26:49,560 --> 00:26:51,960
the long warehousing and chain of custody,

813
00:26:52,300 --> 00:26:52,620
uh,

814
00:26:52,620 --> 00:26:53,131
between,

815
00:26:53,131 --> 00:26:53,270
you know,

816
00:26:53,270 --> 00:26:57,210
between field and fork that
create spoilage issues.

817
00:26:58,170 --> 00:26:59,010
And so,

818
00:26:59,011 --> 00:26:59,191
you know,

819
00:26:59,191 --> 00:27:03,570
there are just a lot of factors
in the system that don't do it,

820
00:27:03,710 --> 00:27:04,110
that,

821
00:27:04,110 --> 00:27:05,490
that spoiled food.

822
00:27:06,210 --> 00:27:07,350
That being said,

823
00:27:07,770 --> 00:27:08,250
um,

824
00:27:08,250 --> 00:27:09,060
we,

825
00:27:09,060 --> 00:27:11,610
we can absolutely grow a
lot more food than we do.

826
00:27:11,900 --> 00:27:12,630
Um,

827
00:27:12,630 --> 00:27:13,770
people are enamored,

828
00:27:13,790 --> 00:27:13,921
you know,

829
00:27:13,921 --> 00:27:18,720
they see six combines running side by
side down through a Kansas wheat field and

830
00:27:19,020 --> 00:27:19,201
say,

831
00:27:19,201 --> 00:27:19,651
wow,

832
00:27:19,651 --> 00:27:20,161
look at that,

833
00:27:20,161 --> 00:27:20,461
you know,

834
00:27:20,461 --> 00:27:21,720
or they see a great big,

835
00:27:22,020 --> 00:27:22,381
you know,

836
00:27:22,381 --> 00:27:26,790
a 500 acre fumigated
strawberry field in California,

837
00:27:26,791 --> 00:27:27,031
you know,

838
00:27:27,031 --> 00:27:27,511
wow,

839
00:27:27,511 --> 00:27:28,410
look at all that production.

840
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:33,800
But the fact is that
even a very rudimentary,

841
00:27:34,291 --> 00:27:39,291
almost poorly done backyard garden is
more productive per square yard than the

842
00:27:40,561 --> 00:27:43,800
most industrial sophisticated,

843
00:27:43,830 --> 00:27:47,250
technologically advanced Monto
speciated industrial farm.

844
00:27:47,610 --> 00:27:48,390
That's the truth.

845
00:27:48,390 --> 00:27:49,223
Why is that?

846
00:27:49,500 --> 00:27:51,900
Why is that is because there is a,

847
00:27:51,990 --> 00:27:52,501
when you,

848
00:27:52,501 --> 00:27:53,580
when you diversify,

849
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:56,010
when you have a diversified,

850
00:27:56,410 --> 00:27:59,910
a cornucopia of plants
and animals in proximity,

851
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:05,600
you actually have a synergistic effect
so that instead of growing one species,

852
00:28:08,820 --> 00:28:13,820
if you reduce the production of one
species and grow to species on the same

853
00:28:15,121 --> 00:28:15,954
area,

854
00:28:17,300 --> 00:28:17,910
um,

855
00:28:17,910 --> 00:28:20,520
you get like 120 percent
of your production.

856
00:28:20,940 --> 00:28:21,900
So for example,

857
00:28:22,110 --> 00:28:22,351
you know,

858
00:28:22,351 --> 00:28:22,580
we,

859
00:28:22,580 --> 00:28:23,140
we,

860
00:28:23,140 --> 00:28:23,360
you know,

861
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:24,660
we have pastured livestock,

862
00:28:24,661 --> 00:28:27,030
so we run the cows across the pasture.

863
00:28:27,180 --> 00:28:29,040
We run the egg mobiles behind them,

864
00:28:29,041 --> 00:28:29,821
the egg mobiles,

865
00:28:29,821 --> 00:28:34,710
or have chickens that scratch to the cow
patties and eat the eat now the newly

866
00:28:34,711 --> 00:28:37,380
exposed grasshoppers
and crickets that the,

867
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:38,010
uh,

868
00:28:38,010 --> 00:28:39,930
that the cows exposed by eating the grass.

869
00:28:40,410 --> 00:28:42,750
And then we run broiler chickens,

870
00:28:43,350 --> 00:28:45,390
meat chickens over that same ground.

871
00:28:45,510 --> 00:28:47,490
We run turkeys over that same ground.

872
00:28:47,790 --> 00:28:50,520
And so all of those animals,

873
00:28:50,550 --> 00:28:53,160
they're not on the same
square foot at the same time,

874
00:28:54,150 --> 00:28:55,260
but they go like,

875
00:28:56,060 --> 00:28:56,481
uh,

876
00:28:56,481 --> 00:28:56,770
you know,

877
00:28:56,770 --> 00:28:57,060
like,

878
00:28:57,060 --> 00:28:57,421
like,

879
00:28:57,421 --> 00:28:57,751
uh,

880
00:28:57,751 --> 00:28:58,584
um,

881
00:28:58,980 --> 00:29:01,020
different waves of,

882
00:29:01,110 --> 00:29:03,840
of production across the landscape.

883
00:29:04,350 --> 00:29:09,350
And so whereas the normal farm would have
only one of those species confined in

884
00:29:09,361 --> 00:29:10,710
a little tiny building.

885
00:29:11,460 --> 00:29:16,460
We have an acre being used all throughout
the year with a lot of different kinds

886
00:29:19,231 --> 00:29:20,700
of species going across.

887
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:24,540
Suddenly you don't have pathogens if
suddenly you don't have the pathogens

888
00:29:24,930 --> 00:29:27,980
because of the pathogens are
confused because you know,

889
00:29:28,920 --> 00:29:29,520
the cow,

890
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:33,460
the cow pathogen hatches out
next to a chicken pathogen and,

891
00:29:33,570 --> 00:29:34,280
or you know,

892
00:29:34,280 --> 00:29:35,800
and they're toxic to each other.

893
00:29:35,801 --> 00:29:36,634
And so they,

894
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:40,620
they have a war in a fight and
a die the cancel each other out.

895
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:42,190
Which is really what's supposed

896
00:29:42,190 --> 00:29:43,023
to happen in nature.

897
00:29:43,030 --> 00:29:43,720
Absolutely.

898
00:29:43,720 --> 00:29:44,553
Absolutely.

899
00:29:44,740 --> 00:29:46,430
And so you know,

900
00:29:46,450 --> 00:29:50,640
the kind of diversity you see
on the Serengeti in Africa at a,

901
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:52,170
at a waterhole,

902
00:29:52,180 --> 00:29:52,560
in,

903
00:29:52,560 --> 00:29:53,393
in

904
00:29:54,490 --> 00:29:55,211
Zimbabwe,

905
00:29:55,211 --> 00:29:55,691
whatever.

906
00:29:55,691 --> 00:29:57,820
I mean those kinds of diversities.

907
00:29:58,630 --> 00:29:58,991
A,

908
00:29:58,991 --> 00:30:01,360
they protect the animals from path,

909
00:30:01,420 --> 00:30:05,590
from their own pathogens because almost
all pathogens are species specific.

910
00:30:06,130 --> 00:30:09,760
So if you put multiple diversity together,

911
00:30:10,060 --> 00:30:10,810
it,

912
00:30:10,810 --> 00:30:12,140
it acts as a,

913
00:30:12,160 --> 00:30:12,993
as a dead end.

914
00:30:13,150 --> 00:30:13,983
Okay.

915
00:30:14,170 --> 00:30:15,040
But secondly,

916
00:30:15,340 --> 00:30:17,980
those animals occupy different spaces.

917
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:18,940
You know,

918
00:30:18,940 --> 00:30:19,510
you've got,

919
00:30:19,510 --> 00:30:21,310
you've got herbivores,

920
00:30:21,340 --> 00:30:22,840
omnivores carnivores,

921
00:30:22,870 --> 00:30:23,360
you know,

922
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:25,510
there are all occupying the same space.

923
00:30:25,511 --> 00:30:29,530
And so a given area can stack.

924
00:30:29,531 --> 00:30:31,120
That's a permaculture concept.

925
00:30:31,121 --> 00:30:32,560
If you're familiar with permaculture,

926
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:38,400
can stack synergistic multiple species
and enterprise on a single land base.

927
00:30:40,700 --> 00:30:40,971
Brian,

928
00:30:40,971 --> 00:30:42,890
pull up a polyface farms.

929
00:30:42,891 --> 00:30:43,221
There's a,

930
00:30:43,221 --> 00:30:44,031
there's a video,

931
00:30:44,031 --> 00:30:44,950
fascinating videos,

932
00:30:44,951 --> 00:30:45,500
so you can,

933
00:30:45,500 --> 00:30:48,920
the folks at home can get a sense of
what he's talking about when he's saying

934
00:30:48,921 --> 00:30:53,921
egg mobiles and you've designed this
sort of chicken house that moves around.

935
00:30:54,621 --> 00:30:54,980
It's,

936
00:30:54,980 --> 00:30:56,660
it's on sleds,

937
00:30:56,690 --> 00:31:01,690
it's all wheels and you pull it around
and so the chickens will be in one spot

938
00:31:01,911 --> 00:31:06,911
and then you move it to another spot and
in doing so you allow the land to get

939
00:31:08,780 --> 00:31:09,980
moved around.

940
00:31:10,650 --> 00:31:11,190
That's right.

941
00:31:11,190 --> 00:31:15,570
Rather than rather than having a
stationary structure where we're carrying

942
00:31:15,571 --> 00:31:17,730
everything in and carrying everything out,

943
00:31:17,940 --> 00:31:22,940
and there's a toxicity buildup with the
animals being confined to one spot all

944
00:31:24,091 --> 00:31:24,924
the time.

945
00:31:25,260 --> 00:31:30,260
Instead you are actually allowing the
animals to move to mimic kind of their

946
00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:34,890
migratory pattern on a domestic scale.

947
00:31:35,370 --> 00:31:37,560
All we're doing is we're
cutting out the natural,

948
00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:40,130
the natural template and,

949
00:31:40,310 --> 00:31:42,680
and laying it down on a
domestic production model.

950
00:31:42,690 --> 00:31:42,871
Say,

951
00:31:42,871 --> 00:31:45,390
how can we duplicate this,

952
00:31:45,420 --> 00:31:45,900
this,

953
00:31:45,900 --> 00:31:48,600
this pattern on a domestic model.

954
00:31:48,620 --> 00:31:48,910
That's what,

955
00:31:48,910 --> 00:31:49,860
that's what we're doing.

956
00:31:50,560 --> 00:31:52,100
And in doing so in like,

957
00:31:52,140 --> 00:31:54,220
this is such a large scale,

958
00:31:54,630 --> 00:31:55,463
um,

959
00:31:55,820 --> 00:32:00,460
can this be duplicated like the factory
farming systems that are so rightly

960
00:32:00,461 --> 00:32:01,660
criticized in this country,

961
00:32:01,661 --> 00:32:03,390
which we find to be a born.

962
00:32:03,430 --> 00:32:07,930
When you look at these videos of these
chickens living stacked next to each

963
00:32:07,931 --> 00:32:08,231
other,

964
00:32:08,231 --> 00:32:08,351
it's,

965
00:32:08,351 --> 00:32:09,370
it's horrific stuff.

966
00:32:09,371 --> 00:32:10,204
It is w,

967
00:32:10,300 --> 00:32:14,890
what is it that's beneficial about
those factory farms that keeps them from

968
00:32:14,891 --> 00:32:16,270
doing something like this?

969
00:32:16,490 --> 00:32:20,900
What you have to understand is that
those factory farms externalize a lot of

970
00:32:20,901 --> 00:32:21,770
their costs.

971
00:32:22,130 --> 00:32:22,551
So there's,

972
00:32:22,551 --> 00:32:27,551
there's collateral damage
of that collateral damage
in terms of water pollution,

973
00:32:29,330 --> 00:32:31,220
fecal particulate in the air.

974
00:32:31,730 --> 00:32:35,660
One of the biggest ones right
now is c diff and Murcia,

975
00:32:36,310 --> 00:32:36,591
you know,

976
00:32:36,591 --> 00:32:36,890
these,

977
00:32:36,890 --> 00:32:37,221
these,

978
00:32:37,221 --> 00:32:37,640
um,

979
00:32:37,640 --> 00:32:38,840
antibiotic resistant,

980
00:32:39,050 --> 00:32:39,550
high,

981
00:32:39,550 --> 00:32:40,031
high,

982
00:32:40,031 --> 00:32:40,864
uh,

983
00:32:40,940 --> 00:32:43,790
high pass staph infections
in hospitals and you know,

984
00:32:43,820 --> 00:32:44,653
that people are getting,

985
00:32:45,110 --> 00:32:45,943
um,

986
00:32:47,320 --> 00:32:47,750
and,

987
00:32:47,750 --> 00:32:48,090
and,

988
00:32:48,090 --> 00:32:48,921
and now of course,

989
00:32:48,921 --> 00:32:49,101
you know,

990
00:32:49,101 --> 00:32:52,760
we're seeing an exponential
growth in autism.

991
00:32:53,910 --> 00:32:54,340
There's a,

992
00:32:54,340 --> 00:32:55,790
there's a link there to,

993
00:32:55,791 --> 00:32:56,290
for example,

994
00:32:56,290 --> 00:32:57,710
genetically modified organisms.

995
00:32:57,711 --> 00:32:58,940
That might be another discussion,

996
00:32:59,100 --> 00:32:59,300
but,

997
00:32:59,300 --> 00:32:59,750
but the,

998
00:32:59,750 --> 00:33:04,750
what I'm getting at is that the collateral
damage of the industrial food system,

999
00:33:05,661 --> 00:33:07,370
including the nutrient deficiency,

1000
00:33:07,371 --> 00:33:10,640
the fact that the Omega sixes and
Omega threes are way out of whack.

1001
00:33:10,670 --> 00:33:11,503
So the fats,

1002
00:33:11,570 --> 00:33:16,570
instead of reducing cholesterol or instead
of being beneficial or are negative.

1003
00:33:17,160 --> 00:33:17,993
Um,

1004
00:33:18,050 --> 00:33:18,883
there are,

1005
00:33:19,160 --> 00:33:21,980
there are huge nutrient deficiencies.

1006
00:33:22,160 --> 00:33:22,520
I mean,

1007
00:33:22,520 --> 00:33:23,390
Riboflavin,

1008
00:33:23,540 --> 00:33:24,710
the eggs in your backyard,

1009
00:33:24,711 --> 00:33:28,970
chickens are probably in the area
of a thousand micrograms per egg.

1010
00:33:29,780 --> 00:33:31,730
You know what the official us Da,

1011
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:32,150
you know,

1012
00:33:32,150 --> 00:33:36,380
nutrient analysis for exit is
only 48 micrograms per eggs,

1013
00:33:36,550 --> 00:33:37,680
cheese and,

1014
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:38,361
and you know,

1015
00:33:38,361 --> 00:33:39,194
and um,

1016
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:40,250
I'm sorry,

1017
00:33:40,250 --> 00:33:41,570
not a folic acid.

1018
00:33:41,690 --> 00:33:42,523
Folic acid,

1019
00:33:42,770 --> 00:33:44,000
grass finished beef,

1020
00:33:44,450 --> 00:33:46,580
a 300 percent more riboflavin.

1021
00:33:47,300 --> 00:33:51,890
A Riboflavin of course is what helps us
to keep calm and not fly off the handle.

1022
00:33:51,891 --> 00:33:52,250
It's a,

1023
00:33:52,250 --> 00:33:52,910
it's the nerve.

1024
00:33:52,910 --> 00:33:54,410
Riboflavin is the nerve one.

1025
00:33:54,690 --> 00:33:55,280
Uh,

1026
00:33:55,280 --> 00:33:55,491
you know,

1027
00:33:55,491 --> 00:33:58,080
why are people raging and
going crazy and you know,

1028
00:33:58,100 --> 00:33:59,660
shooting people in schools and stuff.

1029
00:34:00,070 --> 00:34:00,690
Um,

1030
00:34:00,690 --> 00:34:01,331
because we're,

1031
00:34:01,331 --> 00:34:02,630
we're deficient in Riboflavin.

1032
00:34:02,780 --> 00:34:03,380
So,

1033
00:34:03,380 --> 00:34:03,711
you know,

1034
00:34:03,711 --> 00:34:03,930
when,

1035
00:34:03,930 --> 00:34:05,290
when people say all yeah,

1036
00:34:05,300 --> 00:34:06,770
it doesn't make any
different food is food,

1037
00:34:06,771 --> 00:34:07,604
is food.

1038
00:34:08,120 --> 00:34:08,960
That's not true.

1039
00:34:09,020 --> 00:34:12,710
I mean there's a huge
difference in this food.

1040
00:34:12,750 --> 00:34:13,190
Um,

1041
00:34:13,190 --> 00:34:13,760
you know,

1042
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:16,040
vegetables the same way
whether they're grown in,

1043
00:34:16,180 --> 00:34:16,540
you know,

1044
00:34:16,540 --> 00:34:21,540
mineral dense biologically active
soil compared to hydroponic or just,

1045
00:34:22,940 --> 00:34:23,211
you know,

1046
00:34:23,211 --> 00:34:26,360
what we call a ivy soil,

1047
00:34:26,361 --> 00:34:26,601
you know,

1048
00:34:26,601 --> 00:34:29,330
where the soil is just inert
material to hold up a route.

1049
00:34:29,331 --> 00:34:30,000
And we,

1050
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:34,050
we basically ivy chemical fertilizers
into that soil to grow up,

1051
00:34:34,160 --> 00:34:34,311
you know,

1052
00:34:34,311 --> 00:34:35,144
to grow a plant.

1053
00:34:35,180 --> 00:34:35,780
So there are,

1054
00:34:35,780 --> 00:34:36,613
there are,

1055
00:34:36,830 --> 00:34:41,660
there are significant differences
in the nutritional element.

1056
00:34:41,810 --> 00:34:44,040
So this is all collateral damage and,

1057
00:34:44,330 --> 00:34:44,640
and,

1058
00:34:44,640 --> 00:34:48,170
and the slinky effect
between cause and effect.

1059
00:34:48,370 --> 00:34:49,170
It takes awhile.

1060
00:34:49,170 --> 00:34:49,640
I mean,

1061
00:34:49,640 --> 00:34:50,660
take ddt,

1062
00:34:50,870 --> 00:34:51,471
DDT,

1063
00:34:51,471 --> 00:34:56,471
it took 14 years from its
initial use until 14 years later.

1064
00:34:56,481 --> 00:34:57,800
It was definitively discovered,

1065
00:34:57,830 --> 00:34:58,610
oh,

1066
00:34:58,610 --> 00:35:00,710
that's why we have three
legged salamanders,

1067
00:35:00,711 --> 00:35:05,711
infertile frogs and dead
zones and eagles' eggs,

1068
00:35:06,530 --> 00:35:07,400
eggs won't hatch,

1069
00:35:07,640 --> 00:35:07,970
you know,

1070
00:35:07,970 --> 00:35:08,780
those,

1071
00:35:08,780 --> 00:35:09,613
those,

1072
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:14,630
cause and effects took a while to
materialize because nature is pretty

1073
00:35:14,631 --> 00:35:15,231
resilient,

1074
00:35:15,231 --> 00:35:15,531
you know,

1075
00:35:15,531 --> 00:35:16,364
you can,

1076
00:35:16,940 --> 00:35:17,430
you know,

1077
00:35:17,430 --> 00:35:20,460
you can beat yourself up
for awhile and you know,

1078
00:35:20,840 --> 00:35:22,460
still come out kicking for awhile.

1079
00:35:22,670 --> 00:35:26,090
And I'm sure there's probably also a
financial factors that were resisting the

1080
00:35:26,091 --> 00:35:28,320
conclusions will exactly the,

1081
00:35:28,550 --> 00:35:29,211
all of that.

1082
00:35:29,211 --> 00:35:32,780
Collateral damage is deferred expense,

1083
00:35:33,970 --> 00:35:34,251
you know,

1084
00:35:34,251 --> 00:35:36,020
whether it's obesity,

1085
00:35:36,470 --> 00:35:36,820
health,

1086
00:35:36,820 --> 00:35:37,653
healthcare,

1087
00:35:37,850 --> 00:35:38,683
um,

1088
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:39,300
um,

1089
00:35:39,300 --> 00:35:39,841
pollution,

1090
00:35:39,841 --> 00:35:43,080
clean up a super fund sites,

1091
00:35:43,590 --> 00:35:43,890
you know,

1092
00:35:43,890 --> 00:35:44,970
soil loss,

1093
00:35:46,230 --> 00:35:47,550
aquifer depletion,

1094
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:48,713
um,

1095
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:50,700
desertification,

1096
00:35:50,820 --> 00:35:55,820
these are all differ damages because in
our country we don't have an accounting

1097
00:35:57,841 --> 00:35:59,130
system to measure.

1098
00:35:59,880 --> 00:36:00,480
I mean,

1099
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:01,970
our only accounting system is,

1100
00:36:02,020 --> 00:36:02,330
is,

1101
00:36:02,330 --> 00:36:02,730
um,

1102
00:36:02,730 --> 00:36:03,181
cash,

1103
00:36:03,181 --> 00:36:03,451
you know,

1104
00:36:03,451 --> 00:36:05,490
gross domestic product,

1105
00:36:05,510 --> 00:36:05,700
you know,

1106
00:36:05,700 --> 00:36:06,780
today's output.

1107
00:36:07,230 --> 00:36:09,120
We don't have a way to measure

1108
00:36:11,070 --> 00:36:12,480
these other elements.

1109
00:36:12,570 --> 00:36:12,841
I mean,

1110
00:36:12,841 --> 00:36:13,321
I'll give you,

1111
00:36:13,321 --> 00:36:14,370
I'll give you one example.

1112
00:36:14,371 --> 00:36:14,850
Let's take,

1113
00:36:14,850 --> 00:36:16,170
let's take a earthworms.

1114
00:36:16,950 --> 00:36:20,100
Let's agree that earthworms
are pretty important.

1115
00:36:21,060 --> 00:36:21,893
Well,

1116
00:36:22,260 --> 00:36:22,710
you know,

1117
00:36:22,710 --> 00:36:25,200
who presents a business plan today to,

1118
00:36:25,201 --> 00:36:25,440
uh,

1119
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:28,590
to an investor and the investor says,

1120
00:36:29,100 --> 00:36:29,521
Hey,

1121
00:36:29,521 --> 00:36:31,050
I kinda liked this business plan.

1122
00:36:31,051 --> 00:36:32,670
I think this is a good idea.

1123
00:36:32,670 --> 00:36:33,360
We're going to,

1124
00:36:33,360 --> 00:36:34,590
can I be your partner?

1125
00:36:34,591 --> 00:36:36,000
We're going to be millionaires,

1126
00:36:36,001 --> 00:36:36,301
you know,

1127
00:36:36,301 --> 00:36:36,751
on this,

1128
00:36:36,751 --> 00:36:37,200
uh,

1129
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:38,220
on this business.

1130
00:36:38,221 --> 00:36:38,530
But,

1131
00:36:38,530 --> 00:36:41,970
but before I sign my investment strategy,

1132
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:43,680
I've got one question for you.

1133
00:36:43,681 --> 00:36:43,891
I mean,

1134
00:36:43,891 --> 00:36:44,641
I'm from the south,

1135
00:36:44,641 --> 00:36:44,770
so,

1136
00:36:44,770 --> 00:36:45,070
you know,

1137
00:36:45,070 --> 00:36:46,830
got to have a big hog.

1138
00:36:46,831 --> 00:36:47,480
Okay?

1139
00:36:47,480 --> 00:36:48,313
Um,

1140
00:36:48,690 --> 00:36:49,170
so,

1141
00:36:49,170 --> 00:36:51,000
but I gotta ask you one question.

1142
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:51,810
Oh,

1143
00:36:51,810 --> 00:36:55,470
what's this business going to do
to the earthworms in our community?

1144
00:36:56,790 --> 00:36:57,870
Nobody asks that,

1145
00:36:57,900 --> 00:36:58,131
never.

1146
00:36:58,131 --> 00:36:58,600
Nobody has.

1147
00:36:58,600 --> 00:36:58,950
And,

1148
00:36:58,950 --> 00:36:59,783
and yet,

1149
00:37:00,090 --> 00:37:00,923
and yet,

1150
00:37:01,170 --> 00:37:02,040
fundamentally,

1151
00:37:02,041 --> 00:37:03,040
the micro Rhizobia,

1152
00:37:03,060 --> 00:37:03,900
the earthworms,

1153
00:37:03,901 --> 00:37:04,320
the,

1154
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:04,930
the Aza,

1155
00:37:04,930 --> 00:37:05,271
bacteria,

1156
00:37:05,271 --> 00:37:07,200
bacteria that mycelium the hydro,

1157
00:37:07,201 --> 00:37:08,000
you know,

1158
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:08,820
um,

1159
00:37:08,820 --> 00:37:09,970
they actually this,

1160
00:37:09,971 --> 00:37:14,971
this invisible community of beings
actually supports all of life.

1161
00:37:17,430 --> 00:37:18,263
What we see,

1162
00:37:18,300 --> 00:37:18,750
you know,

1163
00:37:18,750 --> 00:37:19,170
every,

1164
00:37:19,170 --> 00:37:22,830
every visible thing that we see is
supported by an invisible universe of

1165
00:37:22,831 --> 00:37:26,010
microscopic bacteria and
beings in us around us,

1166
00:37:27,240 --> 00:37:28,050
in the soil,

1167
00:37:28,050 --> 00:37:28,883
the cousins,

1168
00:37:29,100 --> 00:37:30,630
and now we know they talk to each other,

1169
00:37:31,570 --> 00:37:36,570
so in a sense what we're getting with
factory farming is one small unit in the

1170
00:37:37,511 --> 00:37:38,344
environment,

1171
00:37:38,350 --> 00:37:43,350
extracting money at the expense of all
these other factors and these extraneous

1172
00:37:44,861 --> 00:37:46,590
costs aren't,

1173
00:37:46,650 --> 00:37:47,770
aren't factored in.

1174
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:49,420
That's because they don't have to be.

1175
00:37:49,660 --> 00:37:51,170
They don't have to be at our.

1176
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:54,320
Our system is not set up for accounting.

1177
00:37:54,620 --> 00:37:55,360
Those other things.

1178
00:37:55,360 --> 00:37:56,080
Thanks.

1179
00:37:56,080 --> 00:37:56,861
That's fascinating.

1180
00:37:56,861 --> 00:37:57,694
So if,

1181
00:37:57,950 --> 00:37:59,650
if it was done correctly,

1182
00:37:59,790 --> 00:38:01,750
it was all done your way,

1183
00:38:02,170 --> 00:38:04,330
although would be more expensive.

1184
00:38:04,360 --> 00:38:07,610
Those external expenses wouldn't exist in,

1185
00:38:07,630 --> 00:38:07,890
in,

1186
00:38:07,890 --> 00:38:09,720
in the big scheme of things.

1187
00:38:09,780 --> 00:38:11,250
In the big scheme of things,

1188
00:38:11,550 --> 00:38:12,570
the actual,

1189
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:18,440
the actual cost of food would actually
be cheaper because you wouldn't have the

1190
00:38:19,621 --> 00:38:20,550
collateral damage.

1191
00:38:20,730 --> 00:38:21,120
I mean,

1192
00:38:21,120 --> 00:38:23,010
just take one example.

1193
00:38:23,011 --> 00:38:25,230
In our lifetime mad cow disease.

1194
00:38:25,460 --> 00:38:25,850
I mean,

1195
00:38:25,850 --> 00:38:27,630
really for 30 years,

1196
00:38:28,710 --> 00:38:33,420
the European and the
American expert credential,

1197
00:38:33,530 --> 00:38:34,363
you know,

1198
00:38:34,870 --> 00:38:39,640
phd academic community took farmers like
me to free steak dinners to teach us

1199
00:38:39,641 --> 00:38:42,940
this new scientific method
of feeding dead gals to cows.

1200
00:38:43,810 --> 00:38:48,100
And our farm was branded a barbarian,

1201
00:38:48,101 --> 00:38:48,934
Luddite,

1202
00:38:49,140 --> 00:38:50,410
anti progressive,

1203
00:38:50,411 --> 00:38:51,010
you know,

1204
00:38:51,010 --> 00:38:53,980
science haters because
we didn't buy into that,

1205
00:38:54,460 --> 00:38:55,150
uh,

1206
00:38:55,150 --> 00:38:55,983
that model.

1207
00:38:56,920 --> 00:38:58,210
The reason we didn't buy into it,

1208
00:38:58,240 --> 00:39:01,720
not because we were anti science or
anti innovation or anything like that

1209
00:39:01,721 --> 00:39:03,610
because I looked around the earth and,

1210
00:39:04,290 --> 00:39:04,630
you know,

1211
00:39:04,630 --> 00:39:07,090
I couldn't find an herbivore
that eats carry on.

1212
00:39:07,430 --> 00:39:07,700
Yeah.

1213
00:39:07,700 --> 00:39:08,560
I couldn't find it.

1214
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:09,873
And so we said,

1215
00:39:09,880 --> 00:39:10,450
well,

1216
00:39:10,450 --> 00:39:11,500
there must be a reason.

1217
00:39:12,900 --> 00:39:13,733
And,

1218
00:39:13,970 --> 00:39:14,320
and,

1219
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:14,771
and here,

1220
00:39:14,771 --> 00:39:15,640
30 years later,

1221
00:39:15,641 --> 00:39:18,580
suddenly there's this
big global collective,

1222
00:39:18,970 --> 00:39:19,450
oops,

1223
00:39:19,450 --> 00:39:21,490
maybe we should not have done that,

1224
00:39:22,030 --> 00:39:22,630
you know,

1225
00:39:22,630 --> 00:39:24,730
as the whole scientific
community realized,

1226
00:39:25,070 --> 00:39:25,510
you know,

1227
00:39:25,510 --> 00:39:26,343
what had happened.

1228
00:39:26,600 --> 00:39:27,490
And so,

1229
00:39:27,790 --> 00:39:28,001
uh,

1230
00:39:28,001 --> 00:39:29,320
so I just think there's a,

1231
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:34,270
that we have to appreciate
that we are in western culture.

1232
00:39:34,271 --> 00:39:34,481
You know,

1233
00:39:34,481 --> 00:39:35,050
we're a,

1234
00:39:35,050 --> 00:39:36,160
we're a product of,

1235
00:39:36,380 --> 00:39:36,710
you know,

1236
00:39:36,710 --> 00:39:37,271
Grieco,

1237
00:39:37,271 --> 00:39:37,781
Roman,

1238
00:39:37,781 --> 00:39:38,201
western,

1239
00:39:38,201 --> 00:39:38,921
reductionist,

1240
00:39:38,921 --> 00:39:39,880
compartmentalized,

1241
00:39:39,881 --> 00:39:40,600
fragmented,

1242
00:39:40,600 --> 00:39:41,460
systematized,

1243
00:39:41,470 --> 00:39:42,340
individualized,

1244
00:39:42,570 --> 00:39:45,130
a democratized parts oriented,

1245
00:39:45,520 --> 00:39:47,110
disconnected thinking.

1246
00:39:47,710 --> 00:39:50,050
And there's an equally appropriate,

1247
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:52,150
a mindset from the east,

1248
00:39:52,151 --> 00:39:52,511
which is,

1249
00:39:52,511 --> 00:39:53,410
we're all connected,

1250
00:39:53,411 --> 00:39:54,370
we're all relatives.

1251
00:39:54,490 --> 00:39:55,630
It's about holes,

1252
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:55,970
you know,

1253
00:39:55,970 --> 00:39:56,741
it's about us,

1254
00:39:56,741 --> 00:39:57,580
not just me.

1255
00:39:58,180 --> 00:40:02,650
And that brings us an
ethical framework as a,

1256
00:40:02,710 --> 00:40:03,543
as a,

1257
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:08,500
as a protection over all moral innovation.

1258
00:40:08,770 --> 00:40:09,160
You know,

1259
00:40:09,160 --> 00:40:10,330
we're so clever.

1260
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:13,180
We can innovate things
that we can't spiritually,

1261
00:40:13,181 --> 00:40:13,780
morally,

1262
00:40:13,780 --> 00:40:14,613
ethically,

1263
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:16,480
or physically metabolize.

1264
00:40:17,080 --> 00:40:21,120
And so what happens is we
innovate these things and then,

1265
00:40:21,310 --> 00:40:22,180
and then spend,

1266
00:40:22,330 --> 00:40:23,163
you know,

1267
00:40:23,170 --> 00:40:25,270
two generations trying to remediate,

1268
00:40:26,230 --> 00:40:28,870
remediate the collateral damage
that are innovations did.

1269
00:40:28,870 --> 00:40:31,670
And if we would just
embrace that there is,

1270
00:40:31,750 --> 00:40:33,700
there should be a moral,

1271
00:40:33,701 --> 00:40:34,534
ethical,

1272
00:40:34,580 --> 00:40:34,890
uh,

1273
00:40:34,890 --> 00:40:35,410
um,

1274
00:40:35,410 --> 00:40:36,730
natural pattern

1275
00:40:38,770 --> 00:40:39,910
that restricts,

1276
00:40:39,940 --> 00:40:42,010
that constrains our innovation.

1277
00:40:42,210 --> 00:40:45,010
Then our innovation could
actually be kept on a,

1278
00:40:45,300 --> 00:40:45,850
you know,

1279
00:40:45,850 --> 00:40:50,850
on an earth massaging tract track
instead of an earth conquistador track.

1280
00:40:51,670 --> 00:40:56,670
So you used to literally get courted
to feed dead cows to cows like,

1281
00:40:57,850 --> 00:40:58,001
oh,

1282
00:40:58,001 --> 00:40:58,631
absolutely.

1283
00:40:58,631 --> 00:40:59,740
A free seminars,

1284
00:40:59,741 --> 00:41:00,011
you know,

1285
00:41:00,011 --> 00:41:01,570
come out and uh,

1286
00:41:01,600 --> 00:41:01,841
you know,

1287
00:41:01,841 --> 00:41:03,150
they've got sponsors,

1288
00:41:03,190 --> 00:41:03,401
you know,

1289
00:41:03,401 --> 00:41:03,970
the logo,

1290
00:41:03,970 --> 00:41:04,181
you know,

1291
00:41:04,181 --> 00:41:05,910
agribusiness community and uh,

1292
00:41:06,370 --> 00:41:07,203
uh,

1293
00:41:07,720 --> 00:41:07,961
you know,

1294
00:41:07,961 --> 00:41:08,980
the industrial,

1295
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:09,701
the,

1296
00:41:09,701 --> 00:41:10,030
uh,

1297
00:41:10,030 --> 00:41:10,630
food and you know,

1298
00:41:10,630 --> 00:41:11,980
the industrial complex would,

1299
00:41:12,010 --> 00:41:12,400
would,

1300
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:13,233
you know,

1301
00:41:13,350 --> 00:41:14,470
buy dinner and,

1302
00:41:15,100 --> 00:41:15,791
and you'd go here,

1303
00:41:15,791 --> 00:41:16,070
these,

1304
00:41:16,070 --> 00:41:16,271
you know,

1305
00:41:16,271 --> 00:41:20,650
these couple phds from the taxpayer
funded research universities,

1306
00:41:20,680 --> 00:41:20,890
you know,

1307
00:41:20,890 --> 00:41:22,120
what was their motivation?

1308
00:41:22,150 --> 00:41:22,410
Well,

1309
00:41:22,410 --> 00:41:24,160
I don't understand why they faster,

1310
00:41:24,310 --> 00:41:24,820
bigger,

1311
00:41:24,820 --> 00:41:25,540
cheaper,

1312
00:41:25,540 --> 00:41:27,340
faster it cheap,

1313
00:41:27,950 --> 00:41:28,480
you know,

1314
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:29,313
I mean,

1315
00:41:30,180 --> 00:41:30,700
it's cheap.

1316
00:41:30,700 --> 00:41:33,210
It's cheap protein to cheap,

1317
00:41:33,350 --> 00:41:33,951
cheap food,

1318
00:41:33,951 --> 00:41:34,360
but the,

1319
00:41:34,360 --> 00:41:37,340
but the idea of making
your cows cannibals.

1320
00:41:37,850 --> 00:41:38,031
Well,

1321
00:41:38,031 --> 00:41:38,211
yeah.

1322
00:41:38,211 --> 00:41:38,341
Well,

1323
00:41:38,341 --> 00:41:38,481
I mean,

1324
00:41:38,481 --> 00:41:38,601
well,

1325
00:41:38,601 --> 00:41:41,180
the industry's still feeds chicken manure.

1326
00:41:41,181 --> 00:41:41,450
I mean,

1327
00:41:41,450 --> 00:41:44,690
well we're still feeding in this
country right now as we sit here.

1328
00:41:44,691 --> 00:41:48,170
We're still feeding chicken feathers
manure and chicken carcasses to chicken.

1329
00:41:48,171 --> 00:41:50,930
They're doing it right
in our neighborhood.

1330
00:41:51,320 --> 00:41:51,520
Uh,

1331
00:41:51,520 --> 00:41:52,820
so that's still being done.

1332
00:41:53,150 --> 00:41:54,920
So we're still feeding
but not but at least,

1333
00:41:54,921 --> 00:41:56,240
but at least it's not cows,

1334
00:41:56,730 --> 00:41:57,563
at least knockout.

1335
00:41:57,770 --> 00:41:58,270
But yeah,

1336
00:41:58,270 --> 00:41:58,361
it,

1337
00:41:58,361 --> 00:41:59,630
it's completely absurd.

1338
00:41:59,690 --> 00:42:04,550
Why is it better to do with chickens and
cows will supposedly it's not the same

1339
00:42:04,551 --> 00:42:05,330
kind of tissue.

1340
00:42:05,330 --> 00:42:05,550
Oh,

1341
00:42:05,550 --> 00:42:06,150
okay.

1342
00:42:06,150 --> 00:42:06,480
You know,

1343
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:07,140
so it's,

1344
00:42:07,140 --> 00:42:09,140
it's at least it's one species removed,

1345
00:42:09,141 --> 00:42:09,351
you know,

1346
00:42:09,351 --> 00:42:10,184
so you have some,

1347
00:42:10,460 --> 00:42:11,860
you have a little bit
of wiggle room for the,

1348
00:42:11,900 --> 00:42:16,900
for the rogue prions that
create the bovine spongiform
encephalopathy and that's

1349
00:42:16,971 --> 00:42:20,420
the same disease that these
cows getting mad cow disease,

1350
00:42:20,421 --> 00:42:22,370
the cannibals get and like in New Guinea,

1351
00:42:22,371 --> 00:42:26,280
these neurological disease
where they can try on's.

1352
00:42:26,300 --> 00:42:26,640
Yeah.

1353
00:42:26,640 --> 00:42:27,200
[inaudible].

1354
00:42:27,200 --> 00:42:27,460
Yeah.

1355
00:42:27,460 --> 00:42:29,450
It punches holes in your brain.

1356
00:42:29,690 --> 00:42:29,871
Yeah.

1357
00:42:29,871 --> 00:42:30,770
It's a pretty uh,

1358
00:42:31,610 --> 00:42:33,170
it's a pretty bad way to go.

1359
00:42:33,480 --> 00:42:35,150
It seems pretty dark.

1360
00:42:35,390 --> 00:42:37,820
When did factory farming start?

1361
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:38,450
Like the,

1362
00:42:38,450 --> 00:42:41,000
what we consider today factory farming?

1363
00:42:41,001 --> 00:42:41,900
When did all that start?

1364
00:42:41,910 --> 00:42:42,030
Yeah,

1365
00:42:42,030 --> 00:42:42,171
well,

1366
00:42:42,171 --> 00:42:45,860
it's a great question and it
really started in the thirties,

1367
00:42:45,861 --> 00:42:47,150
forties and fifties.

1368
00:42:47,560 --> 00:42:48,393
I'm,

1369
00:42:48,590 --> 00:42:51,500
a lot of things had to come
together and of course,

1370
00:42:51,760 --> 00:42:52,030
you know,

1371
00:42:52,030 --> 00:42:53,330
Michael Pollan in his,

1372
00:42:53,331 --> 00:42:53,461
uh,

1373
00:42:53,461 --> 00:42:54,920
I think omnivore's dilemma,

1374
00:42:55,120 --> 00:42:55,880
um,

1375
00:42:55,880 --> 00:42:57,740
examined this pretty nicely,

1376
00:42:57,741 --> 00:43:02,420
but to point out that or Eric
Schlosser and fast food nation,

1377
00:43:02,421 --> 00:43:02,541
you know,

1378
00:43:02,541 --> 00:43:03,740
that was a blockbuster,

1379
00:43:03,741 --> 00:43:03,951
you know,

1380
00:43:03,951 --> 00:43:08,030
when it came out and a lot of
factors had to be in place.

1381
00:43:08,031 --> 00:43:11,810
One was we had to have cheap
energy because prior to,

1382
00:43:12,170 --> 00:43:13,640
in order to have a factory farm,

1383
00:43:13,940 --> 00:43:18,530
you have to have cheap transportation in
order to bring in order to concentrate

1384
00:43:19,430 --> 00:43:24,430
that many beings in one place and
feed them and remove their excrement.

1385
00:43:26,090 --> 00:43:27,770
You have to have cheap transportation.

1386
00:43:27,771 --> 00:43:28,820
Cheap transportation,

1387
00:43:29,130 --> 00:43:29,421
uh,

1388
00:43:29,421 --> 00:43:30,680
requires cheap energy.

1389
00:43:31,670 --> 00:43:31,911
You know,

1390
00:43:31,911 --> 00:43:33,650
when everything was draft power,

1391
00:43:33,920 --> 00:43:35,480
mules and horses and oxen,

1392
00:43:35,690 --> 00:43:39,230
you simply couldn't
amalgamate that many things,

1393
00:43:39,620 --> 00:43:42,650
whether it was animals or shoes or,

1394
00:43:42,950 --> 00:43:44,150
or metal,

1395
00:43:44,780 --> 00:43:45,180
uh,

1396
00:43:45,180 --> 00:43:48,560
you couldn't amalgamate
that much material in,

1397
00:43:49,170 --> 00:43:50,003
in,

1398
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:50,840
in,

1399
00:43:50,840 --> 00:43:51,740
in one place.

1400
00:43:51,950 --> 00:43:52,400
So,

1401
00:43:52,400 --> 00:43:55,250
so every manufacturing facility,

1402
00:43:55,251 --> 00:43:57,800
whether it was a farm or you know,

1403
00:43:57,960 --> 00:44:02,960
other manufacturing had to nest within
the carrying capacity of its ecological

1404
00:44:04,220 --> 00:44:04,791
womb,

1405
00:44:04,791 --> 00:44:05,340
if you will.

1406
00:44:05,340 --> 00:44:06,110
There was a,

1407
00:44:06,110 --> 00:44:06,950
there was a limit,

1408
00:44:08,360 --> 00:44:11,810
how far can we cart stuff in and
how far can we cart stuff out.

1409
00:44:11,930 --> 00:44:15,590
There was a limit to that until we had
cheap energy and cheap transportation.

1410
00:44:15,591 --> 00:44:18,050
So that really catapulted this.

1411
00:44:18,320 --> 00:44:19,640
Then the next thing we had to have,

1412
00:44:19,970 --> 00:44:22,010
we had to have people water,

1413
00:44:22,011 --> 00:44:22,844
we had to have.

1414
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:23,221
So,

1415
00:44:23,221 --> 00:44:24,590
so that meant plastic piping.

1416
00:44:24,591 --> 00:44:26,000
We had to have very cheap piping.

1417
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:26,570
I mean,

1418
00:44:26,570 --> 00:44:28,670
until then it was all cast iron pipe,

1419
00:44:28,820 --> 00:44:29,060
you know,

1420
00:44:29,060 --> 00:44:30,020
in the 18 hundreds,

1421
00:44:30,021 --> 00:44:30,530
it was,

1422
00:44:30,530 --> 00:44:31,290
you know,

1423
00:44:31,290 --> 00:44:35,430
took a piece of wood and took
an Auger and boarded out,

1424
00:44:35,431 --> 00:44:35,821
you know,

1425
00:44:35,821 --> 00:44:35,891
and,

1426
00:44:35,891 --> 00:44:38,160
and pasted little pipes together.

1427
00:44:38,161 --> 00:44:40,980
So we had to have a plastic,

1428
00:44:41,010 --> 00:44:42,540
so plastic had to be developed,

1429
00:44:42,690 --> 00:44:44,310
which of course required petroleum.

1430
00:44:44,510 --> 00:44:46,080
So petroleum was really a catalyst.

1431
00:44:46,081 --> 00:44:46,980
And then finally,

1432
00:44:47,190 --> 00:44:52,110
in order to keep that many animals
alive in one spot required antibiotics

1433
00:44:52,410 --> 00:44:54,390
because the fecal particulate,

1434
00:44:54,420 --> 00:44:57,300
the fecal dust cloud that they live in,

1435
00:44:57,301 --> 00:45:01,320
that they ingest is very
abrasive to the very tender,

1436
00:45:01,700 --> 00:45:02,533
um,

1437
00:45:03,030 --> 00:45:03,863
mucus,

1438
00:45:03,960 --> 00:45:05,340
respiratory membranes,

1439
00:45:05,840 --> 00:45:07,010
all the Caelian,

1440
00:45:07,020 --> 00:45:07,320
those,

1441
00:45:07,320 --> 00:45:08,120
those very,

1442
00:45:08,120 --> 00:45:08,880
um,

1443
00:45:08,880 --> 00:45:09,061
you know,

1444
00:45:09,061 --> 00:45:10,770
you look at them under
a microscope and it's,

1445
00:45:11,020 --> 00:45:11,853
it's like a,

1446
00:45:12,660 --> 00:45:15,210
it's like going into a
Steven Spielberg set,

1447
00:45:15,211 --> 00:45:15,481
you know,

1448
00:45:15,481 --> 00:45:16,560
it's just amazing.

1449
00:45:16,890 --> 00:45:17,400
Well,

1450
00:45:17,400 --> 00:45:20,850
those very tender mucous membranes

1451
00:45:22,530 --> 00:45:24,270
get sandpaper by this,

1452
00:45:24,340 --> 00:45:24,960
um,

1453
00:45:24,960 --> 00:45:26,070
fecal particulate,

1454
00:45:26,130 --> 00:45:29,640
this a brace of air and they bleed then.

1455
00:45:29,860 --> 00:45:34,860
And this is how Salmonella and in
some of these things get into the,

1456
00:45:36,120 --> 00:45:38,040
into the actual tissue,

1457
00:45:38,070 --> 00:45:39,060
even into the eggs.

1458
00:45:39,061 --> 00:45:41,520
Remember the Wisconsin
farm with the Salmonella,

1459
00:45:42,060 --> 00:45:46,940
it actually gets into the oviduct
because now the old the bodies,

1460
00:45:47,320 --> 00:45:48,153
um,

1461
00:45:48,180 --> 00:45:49,950
toxic hedges,

1462
00:45:49,951 --> 00:45:50,340
you know,

1463
00:45:50,340 --> 00:45:50,931
filters,

1464
00:45:50,931 --> 00:45:51,764
it's strainers,

1465
00:45:51,930 --> 00:45:54,360
have been overridden by this,

1466
00:45:55,110 --> 00:45:55,943
um,

1467
00:45:56,040 --> 00:45:56,780
you know,

1468
00:45:56,780 --> 00:46:01,380
by this direct hemorrhaging of
the tinder mucous membranes,

1469
00:46:01,381 --> 00:46:02,820
it gets right into the bloodstream.

1470
00:46:03,030 --> 00:46:03,860
So that's how it,

1471
00:46:03,860 --> 00:46:04,140
you know,

1472
00:46:04,140 --> 00:46:04,320
it,

1473
00:46:04,320 --> 00:46:05,940
it jumps those regular,

1474
00:46:06,420 --> 00:46:07,253
um,

1475
00:46:07,390 --> 00:46:08,160
uh,

1476
00:46:08,160 --> 00:46:08,993
strainers.

1477
00:46:10,260 --> 00:46:11,031
And so,

1478
00:46:11,031 --> 00:46:15,240
so the antibiotics were
necessary to try to,

1479
00:46:15,540 --> 00:46:16,020
uh,

1480
00:46:16,020 --> 00:46:18,930
in order to keep the animals
in such an unsterile,

1481
00:46:19,150 --> 00:46:22,080
an unhealthy environment
to keep them alive.

1482
00:46:22,380 --> 00:46:25,680
I don't know whether you've watched
just lately what's happened with pigs.

1483
00:46:26,010 --> 00:46:27,390
I'm Jay.

1484
00:46:27,420 --> 00:46:30,540
It's been all over the newspapers
and Wall Street Journal even,

1485
00:46:30,710 --> 00:46:31,350
you know,

1486
00:46:31,350 --> 00:46:33,780
when you see pig futures
at Wall Street Journal,

1487
00:46:33,781 --> 00:46:34,051
you know,

1488
00:46:34,051 --> 00:46:35,130
something's going on.

1489
00:46:35,640 --> 00:46:36,331
And uh,

1490
00:46:36,331 --> 00:46:39,150
I think it was in January and February,

1491
00:46:39,360 --> 00:46:40,410
they almost doubled.

1492
00:46:40,470 --> 00:46:41,340
What's the problem?

1493
00:46:41,580 --> 00:46:43,470
Starting April one last year,

1494
00:46:43,471 --> 00:46:44,610
just April one last year.

1495
00:46:44,611 --> 00:46:44,941
So we're,

1496
00:46:44,941 --> 00:46:45,300
we're,

1497
00:46:45,300 --> 00:46:45,690
we're,

1498
00:46:45,690 --> 00:46:48,570
we're literally 12 months
into this exactly 12 months,

1499
00:46:49,320 --> 00:46:54,320
the industry started losing one in
four piggies industrywide to a viral

1500
00:46:56,281 --> 00:46:57,114
diarrhea.

1501
00:46:58,020 --> 00:46:58,171
Now,

1502
00:46:58,171 --> 00:46:59,100
my joke is,

1503
00:46:59,300 --> 00:46:59,700
you know,

1504
00:46:59,700 --> 00:47:01,710
if there's one thing worse than diarrhea,

1505
00:47:01,711 --> 00:47:03,840
it's got to be viral diarrhea,

1506
00:47:04,020 --> 00:47:04,853
but,

1507
00:47:04,980 --> 00:47:05,820
but anyway,

1508
00:47:06,030 --> 00:47:06,480
um,

1509
00:47:06,480 --> 00:47:07,140
this,

1510
00:47:07,140 --> 00:47:07,590
this,

1511
00:47:07,590 --> 00:47:08,423
um,

1512
00:47:08,640 --> 00:47:11,550
this is attacking the industrial pigs.

1513
00:47:11,670 --> 00:47:15,420
We're not seeing it out in the countryside
and pastured pigs and are sort of

1514
00:47:15,421 --> 00:47:16,050
things,

1515
00:47:16,050 --> 00:47:20,030
but it's making a pork futures skyrocket.

1516
00:47:20,040 --> 00:47:21,990
The industry is on it's heels.

1517
00:47:22,260 --> 00:47:23,610
They're desperate to find a,

1518
00:47:23,970 --> 00:47:25,500
find a cure.

1519
00:47:25,530 --> 00:47:25,771
Of course,

1520
00:47:25,771 --> 00:47:26,220
you know,

1521
00:47:26,220 --> 00:47:29,440
finding a cure would mean
changing their model,

1522
00:47:29,441 --> 00:47:30,274
but of course they're,

1523
00:47:30,880 --> 00:47:32,830
they're trying to find
a technological cure,

1524
00:47:32,860 --> 00:47:33,100
you know,

1525
00:47:33,100 --> 00:47:36,250
some more potent concoction.

1526
00:47:36,520 --> 00:47:37,180
Alright,

1527
00:47:37,180 --> 00:47:38,970
to knock this out in such an,

1528
00:47:39,030 --> 00:47:40,930
an unhealthy environment.

1529
00:47:41,230 --> 00:47:43,250
And so imagine that,

1530
00:47:43,260 --> 00:47:43,511
I mean,

1531
00:47:43,511 --> 00:47:44,200
nationwide,

1532
00:47:44,200 --> 00:47:44,951
of all the whatever,

1533
00:47:44,951 --> 00:47:45,820
millions of pigs,

1534
00:47:46,480 --> 00:47:47,560
one in four,

1535
00:47:47,561 --> 00:47:52,561
25 percent of all piggies right now
being born in the US are dying from viral

1536
00:47:54,011 --> 00:47:54,660
diarrhea.

1537
00:47:54,660 --> 00:47:55,560
That's incredible.

1538
00:47:55,620 --> 00:47:56,150
Yeah,

1539
00:47:56,150 --> 00:47:56,420
it's,

1540
00:47:56,420 --> 00:47:57,330
it's a big deal,

1541
00:47:57,480 --> 00:47:58,140
big deal.

1542
00:47:58,140 --> 00:47:59,820
This environment that
you're talking about,

1543
00:47:59,821 --> 00:48:01,820
this pathogen enriched
environment where they're,

1544
00:48:01,830 --> 00:48:04,050
they're the fetal particulates in the air,

1545
00:48:04,080 --> 00:48:07,110
completely not natural in nature.

1546
00:48:07,480 --> 00:48:12,480
There are wide open fields in the EHR and
the natural environment filters all of

1547
00:48:13,200 --> 00:48:13,620
this.

1548
00:48:13,620 --> 00:48:16,530
Is this something that's
completely been over the last,

1549
00:48:16,950 --> 00:48:17,670
you know,

1550
00:48:17,670 --> 00:48:18,830
less than 100 years now?

1551
00:48:19,130 --> 00:48:20,460
It's very recent.

1552
00:48:20,461 --> 00:48:21,540
It's only in the last,

1553
00:48:21,750 --> 00:48:22,021
you know,

1554
00:48:22,021 --> 00:48:23,280
50 to 60 years.

1555
00:48:23,650 --> 00:48:23,900
Uh,

1556
00:48:23,900 --> 00:48:28,470
our rule of thumb is that
a good food production,

1557
00:48:28,980 --> 00:48:29,700
good farming,

1558
00:48:29,700 --> 00:48:34,140
good food production should be
aesthetically and aromatically.

1559
00:48:34,260 --> 00:48:36,030
Sensually romantic,

1560
00:48:36,560 --> 00:48:37,393
you know,

1561
00:48:37,440 --> 00:48:38,130
I mean,

1562
00:48:38,130 --> 00:48:38,490
look,

1563
00:48:38,490 --> 00:48:42,420
if you've got a walk through sheep dip
and put on a hazmat suit to go visit your

1564
00:48:42,421 --> 00:48:43,170
food,

1565
00:48:43,170 --> 00:48:44,490
you might not want to eat it.

1566
00:48:45,090 --> 00:48:45,923
Yeah,

1567
00:48:46,810 --> 00:48:47,610
yeah,

1568
00:48:47,610 --> 00:48:48,443
absolutely.

1569
00:48:48,600 --> 00:48:49,470
Now this,

1570
00:48:50,370 --> 00:48:52,320
this idea of factory farming,

1571
00:48:52,820 --> 00:48:53,090
this,

1572
00:48:53,090 --> 00:48:58,090
this huge large scale thing where
you're stuffing all these chickens into,

1573
00:48:58,800 --> 00:48:59,130
could,

1574
00:48:59,130 --> 00:49:04,130
could those farms be converted to a
more holistic approach like you're,

1575
00:49:04,291 --> 00:49:05,730
you're prescribing.

1576
00:49:07,800 --> 00:49:09,990
That is such a great question.

1577
00:49:10,040 --> 00:49:10,750
And,

1578
00:49:10,750 --> 00:49:13,200
and I'll tell you the truth.

1579
00:49:13,410 --> 00:49:18,410
My heart goes out to farmers who
have signed on the dotted line and,

1580
00:49:18,951 --> 00:49:19,730
and,

1581
00:49:19,730 --> 00:49:21,870
and been kind of taken in by this,

1582
00:49:22,160 --> 00:49:23,130
by this model,

1583
00:49:23,670 --> 00:49:28,670
but the fact is they are so anti
nature that I don't see a retrofit a.

1584
00:49:34,810 --> 00:49:39,150
and that's one of the problems when you
have capital intensive infrastructure,

1585
00:49:39,360 --> 00:49:40,780
when you have single,

1586
00:49:40,980 --> 00:49:45,030
single designed or single use
capital intensive infrastructure,

1587
00:49:45,570 --> 00:49:50,570
even when it becomes a detriment to
society to have that infrastructure,

1588
00:49:51,540 --> 00:49:56,370
we still have to use it because we're
economically and emotionally vested in it.

1589
00:49:56,720 --> 00:49:57,090
You know,

1590
00:49:57,090 --> 00:49:59,850
our toys run our thinking.

1591
00:50:00,500 --> 00:50:01,333
Um,

1592
00:50:01,380 --> 00:50:01,651
I mean,

1593
00:50:01,651 --> 00:50:01,830
look,

1594
00:50:01,830 --> 00:50:02,663
look at,

1595
00:50:03,810 --> 00:50:04,980
look at the health field.

1596
00:50:05,190 --> 00:50:05,491
I mean,

1597
00:50:05,491 --> 00:50:05,630
you know,

1598
00:50:05,630 --> 00:50:09,940
we have to use our infrastructure because
it's really expensive and so we've got

1599
00:50:09,941 --> 00:50:10,890
to use this stuff.

1600
00:50:11,280 --> 00:50:13,230
And the same thing is true in farming.

1601
00:50:13,231 --> 00:50:13,490
Now,

1602
00:50:13,490 --> 00:50:13,860
you know,

1603
00:50:13,860 --> 00:50:16,890
when you pour that much concrete
and bend that much rebar,

1604
00:50:17,320 --> 00:50:18,153
uh,

1605
00:50:18,520 --> 00:50:19,321
you know,

1606
00:50:19,321 --> 00:50:19,800
you,

1607
00:50:19,800 --> 00:50:21,720
you feel compelled to use it.

1608
00:50:22,560 --> 00:50:23,161
So it's a,

1609
00:50:23,161 --> 00:50:24,150
it's a real problem.

1610
00:50:24,720 --> 00:50:25,560
And um,

1611
00:50:25,950 --> 00:50:27,380
and I just,

1612
00:50:27,390 --> 00:50:28,223
um,

1613
00:50:31,170 --> 00:50:31,410
yeah,

1614
00:50:31,410 --> 00:50:36,410
I just don't see really efficient
ways of retrofitting a lot of these

1615
00:50:38,070 --> 00:50:38,903
structures.

1616
00:50:39,340 --> 00:50:39,770
Uh,

1617
00:50:39,770 --> 00:50:40,020
you know,

1618
00:50:40,020 --> 00:50:42,600
they might make good
miniature golf courses.

1619
00:50:42,601 --> 00:50:43,434
They might,

1620
00:50:43,610 --> 00:50:44,443
you know,

1621
00:50:44,620 --> 00:50:45,453
mail though.

1622
00:50:46,950 --> 00:50:47,783
God.

1623
00:50:48,300 --> 00:50:48,900
Yeah.

1624
00:50:48,900 --> 00:50:49,420
Well,

1625
00:50:49,420 --> 00:50:50,070
uh,

1626
00:50:50,070 --> 00:50:50,491
I mean,

1627
00:50:50,491 --> 00:50:51,324
just to give you,

1628
00:50:51,740 --> 00:50:55,860
to give you an example of some things
that can be done with a different model.

1629
00:50:56,700 --> 00:50:57,533
One is,

1630
00:50:58,290 --> 00:50:59,370
just to give you an example,

1631
00:50:59,550 --> 00:51:04,090
one is that if you go to
a composting betting in a,

1632
00:51:04,100 --> 00:51:04,650
in a,

1633
00:51:04,650 --> 00:51:05,700
in an operation,

1634
00:51:06,100 --> 00:51:06,933
um,

1635
00:51:06,960 --> 00:51:09,180
you can ameliorate a lot of the problems.

1636
00:51:09,780 --> 00:51:11,880
The problem is that that
takes a lot of carbon.

1637
00:51:13,530 --> 00:51:14,760
In order to have compost,

1638
00:51:15,930 --> 00:51:20,930
you have to have a carbon nitrogen ratio
that somewhere in the neighborhood of

1639
00:51:21,540 --> 00:51:23,520
25 to 35 to one.

1640
00:51:23,850 --> 00:51:24,810
All right can,

1641
00:51:24,820 --> 00:51:26,130
it's called the CN ratio.

1642
00:51:27,150 --> 00:51:28,320
And of course you have to have,

1643
00:51:28,680 --> 00:51:30,030
you have to have a moisture,

1644
00:51:30,090 --> 00:51:32,040
you have to have air and
you have to have microbes.

1645
00:51:32,070 --> 00:51:34,800
So there's five components
to a mike to a compost pile,

1646
00:51:35,160 --> 00:51:39,630
but you have to have one other thing
and that is enough size to support an

1647
00:51:39,631 --> 00:51:41,820
internal community of microbial beings.

1648
00:51:42,180 --> 00:51:42,451
And Yeah,

1649
00:51:42,451 --> 00:51:43,320
they've got to have their,

1650
00:51:43,380 --> 00:51:44,213
you know,

1651
00:51:44,340 --> 00:51:45,151
TV shows.

1652
00:51:45,151 --> 00:51:46,140
I got to build their roads,

1653
00:51:46,141 --> 00:51:46,891
have their schools,

1654
00:51:46,891 --> 00:51:47,311
you know,

1655
00:51:47,311 --> 00:51:50,640
and I have banks and
politicians and stuff too.

1656
00:51:50,910 --> 00:51:51,320
So it,

1657
00:51:51,320 --> 00:51:56,320
it takes room for these microorganisms
to build those communities.

1658
00:51:57,720 --> 00:51:58,620
You can't build.

1659
00:51:58,621 --> 00:52:01,530
A compost pile is 12 inches
by 12 inches by 12 inches.

1660
00:52:01,710 --> 00:52:02,543
Too small.

1661
00:52:02,810 --> 00:52:05,400
The smallest size is like a yard by yard,

1662
00:52:05,401 --> 00:52:06,234
by yard.

1663
00:52:06,380 --> 00:52:07,213
All right,

1664
00:52:07,370 --> 00:52:08,203
well,

1665
00:52:09,330 --> 00:52:14,330
the problem is that in most you
know a factory farming facilities,

1666
00:52:18,200 --> 00:52:22,070
you can not only can you not even have
any bedding in or the animals are on

1667
00:52:22,080 --> 00:52:26,410
slatted floors or virtually
a note concrete there.

1668
00:52:26,490 --> 00:52:28,830
There is no life.

1669
00:52:28,860 --> 00:52:32,130
There is no community of beings,

1670
00:52:33,360 --> 00:52:36,030
good community of beings in nature.

1671
00:52:36,420 --> 00:52:40,500
A lot of people don't realize there
are a lot more good bacteria than bad

1672
00:52:40,501 --> 00:52:40,861
bacteria.

1673
00:52:40,861 --> 00:52:43,740
There really aren't that
many bad bacteria in nature.

1674
00:52:44,010 --> 00:52:44,370
You know,

1675
00:52:44,370 --> 00:52:46,220
if you're keeping score of,

1676
00:52:46,230 --> 00:52:47,670
of of things,

1677
00:52:48,030 --> 00:52:50,280
there actually a lot more
good ones than bad ones.

1678
00:52:50,310 --> 00:52:55,310
When you come to this invisible world of
little microbial beings and and so the

1679
00:52:56,401 --> 00:52:57,450
default position,

1680
00:52:57,451 --> 00:52:59,910
what I'm getting to is the
default position of nature,

1681
00:53:00,540 --> 00:53:01,373
his health.

1682
00:53:03,700 --> 00:53:05,350
We in our culture right now,

1683
00:53:05,351 --> 00:53:10,351
we've got things so out of whack that
we just assume that the default position

1684
00:53:10,781 --> 00:53:11,980
of nature is sickness.

1685
00:53:12,570 --> 00:53:14,500
Nature's broken and I've got to fix it.

1686
00:53:14,890 --> 00:53:15,730
That's not true.

1687
00:53:16,120 --> 00:53:18,790
The default position of
nature is wellness and health.

1688
00:53:19,420 --> 00:53:24,420
If if their sickness then then that
indicates something out of whack.

1689
00:53:25,380 --> 00:53:25,880
There's a,

1690
00:53:25,880 --> 00:53:26,160
there's,

1691
00:53:26,160 --> 00:53:26,993
there's a,

1692
00:53:27,180 --> 00:53:28,830
there's a protocol has been violated.

1693
00:53:29,820 --> 00:53:34,110
So one of the ways to house animals,

1694
00:53:34,200 --> 00:53:36,720
at least temporarily in shelter,

1695
00:53:37,050 --> 00:53:38,880
is to have a living,

1696
00:53:39,840 --> 00:53:40,673
a living,

1697
00:53:41,280 --> 00:53:42,113
um,

1698
00:53:42,660 --> 00:53:43,493
blanket,

1699
00:53:44,190 --> 00:53:49,190
I call it a carbonaceous diaper for them
to live on a that is deep enough and

1700
00:53:51,001 --> 00:53:56,001
alive enough with all these microbes so
that Neba toads attack the pathogenic

1701
00:53:56,970 --> 00:53:57,601
microbes.

1702
00:53:57,601 --> 00:53:58,200
So that,

1703
00:53:58,200 --> 00:53:58,500
uh,

1704
00:53:58,500 --> 00:53:59,011
in this,

1705
00:53:59,011 --> 00:54:00,390
in this sphere,

1706
00:54:00,840 --> 00:54:01,710
there's enough,

1707
00:54:01,930 --> 00:54:02,763
um,

1708
00:54:02,820 --> 00:54:07,470
community of beings interacting in
this war of good bugs and bad bugs.

1709
00:54:07,471 --> 00:54:09,090
The good bugs beat out the bad bugs.

1710
00:54:09,430 --> 00:54:09,910
That's,

1711
00:54:09,910 --> 00:54:11,130
that's the right position.

1712
00:54:12,030 --> 00:54:12,930
And that can be done.

1713
00:54:12,931 --> 00:54:16,410
And we actually used that when we feed
hay in the winter time in our hay shed,

1714
00:54:16,411 --> 00:54:20,280
we use it for the pigs in the winter
when they're in housing for the,

1715
00:54:20,310 --> 00:54:22,080
for the brooder house
where we start chicks,

1716
00:54:22,830 --> 00:54:23,041
we,

1717
00:54:23,041 --> 00:54:23,311
you know,

1718
00:54:23,311 --> 00:54:27,290
we have it where we can build up 24
inches of bedding in the hay shed with the

1719
00:54:27,300 --> 00:54:27,571
cows.

1720
00:54:27,571 --> 00:54:31,650
We can go four feet deep with
this carbonaceous living,

1721
00:54:31,860 --> 00:54:35,010
composting a bedding and um,

1722
00:54:35,550 --> 00:54:36,010
and you know,

1723
00:54:36,010 --> 00:54:36,111
and,

1724
00:54:36,111 --> 00:54:38,310
and that is a partial answer,

1725
00:54:40,110 --> 00:54:45,110
but the buildings that are currently
designed can't handle a living,

1726
00:54:45,661 --> 00:54:49,250
compost medium for the
animals to be on their street.

1727
00:54:49,400 --> 00:54:51,720
They're structurally not
designed to handle that.

1728
00:54:52,290 --> 00:54:53,123
And so,

1729
00:54:53,630 --> 00:54:54,000
you know,

1730
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:56,250
the retrofit becomes pretty tough.

1731
00:54:56,760 --> 00:54:57,930
That's fascinating.

1732
00:54:57,931 --> 00:55:00,930
So it's almost like they need to be
destroyed and it needs to be start from

1733
00:55:00,931 --> 00:55:01,764
scratch.

1734
00:55:02,460 --> 00:55:03,120
Yeah.

1735
00:55:03,120 --> 00:55:03,370
Yeah.

1736
00:55:03,370 --> 00:55:03,800
And,

1737
00:55:03,800 --> 00:55:04,131
and,

1738
00:55:04,131 --> 00:55:04,470
uh,

1739
00:55:04,470 --> 00:55:09,470
the beautiful thing is really they don't
need to be replaced with very much.

1740
00:55:12,210 --> 00:55:13,470
They just need to be abandoned.

1741
00:55:14,500 --> 00:55:15,333
Most,

1742
00:55:15,880 --> 00:55:16,620
you know,

1743
00:55:16,620 --> 00:55:17,250
most,

1744
00:55:17,250 --> 00:55:17,641
most,

1745
00:55:17,641 --> 00:55:18,474
most,

1746
00:55:18,540 --> 00:55:20,580
most great breakthroughs
throughout history.

1747
00:55:20,640 --> 00:55:22,860
Breakthroughs have been break widths.

1748
00:55:23,400 --> 00:55:24,233
Something.

1749
00:55:24,900 --> 00:55:26,220
Think about the breakthrough for,

1750
00:55:26,221 --> 00:55:26,881
for example,

1751
00:55:26,881 --> 00:55:27,450
um,

1752
00:55:27,450 --> 00:55:28,440
compact discs.

1753
00:55:29,010 --> 00:55:29,843
You know,

1754
00:55:30,510 --> 00:55:33,780
the Germans tried to
do it for a long time,

1755
00:55:34,140 --> 00:55:38,970
but they couldn't get past
the long play disk model,

1756
00:55:39,030 --> 00:55:39,863
you know,

1757
00:55:39,980 --> 00:55:40,190
uh,

1758
00:55:40,190 --> 00:55:44,850
that we just can't do it in the Japanese
who didn't have a history of LP records

1759
00:55:44,970 --> 00:55:45,960
like Germany did.

1760
00:55:46,320 --> 00:55:46,651
They said,

1761
00:55:46,651 --> 00:55:47,040
well,

1762
00:55:47,040 --> 00:55:48,270
why does it have to be,

1763
00:55:48,460 --> 00:55:48,840
you know,

1764
00:55:48,840 --> 00:55:49,673
this size,

1765
00:55:49,710 --> 00:55:50,820
let's make it smaller.

1766
00:55:50,970 --> 00:55:51,360
Boom.

1767
00:55:51,360 --> 00:55:52,380
Japanese owned,

1768
00:55:53,030 --> 00:55:53,220
you know,

1769
00:55:53,220 --> 00:55:54,120
that whole market,

1770
00:55:54,460 --> 00:55:54,870
uh,

1771
00:55:54,870 --> 00:55:59,070
so it was a break with
tradition and many innovations,

1772
00:55:59,071 --> 00:56:01,200
many innovative things.

1773
00:56:02,070 --> 00:56:03,660
Our break widths,

1774
00:56:04,650 --> 00:56:06,350
that's the key to the breakthrough.

1775
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:07,510
There's a lot of,

1776
00:56:07,510 --> 00:56:07,720
a lot of

1777
00:56:07,720 --> 00:56:11,170
people that don't realize that what we're
dealing with when you're talking about

1778
00:56:11,171 --> 00:56:15,160
a lot of the flues and a lot of
the diseases that become pandemics,

1779
00:56:15,161 --> 00:56:16,780
that they start with livestock,

1780
00:56:17,510 --> 00:56:18,370
avian flu,

1781
00:56:18,410 --> 00:56:19,390
swine flu,

1782
00:56:19,391 --> 00:56:24,310
some of the most horrific flus that we've
experienced in the past hundred years

1783
00:56:24,311 --> 00:56:27,100
have come as a direct result
of this type of farming.

1784
00:56:27,730 --> 00:56:28,001
Yes,

1785
00:56:28,001 --> 00:56:28,650
that's right.

1786
00:56:28,650 --> 00:56:28,990
Uh,

1787
00:56:28,990 --> 00:56:29,823
the,

1788
00:56:29,860 --> 00:56:30,341
the,

1789
00:56:30,341 --> 00:56:31,174
um,

1790
00:56:32,170 --> 00:56:33,610
the concentration,

1791
00:56:34,360 --> 00:56:34,561
the,

1792
00:56:34,561 --> 00:56:38,410
the total unnatural concentration and,

1793
00:56:38,790 --> 00:56:42,340
and buildup of toxicity in
these places is incredible.

1794
00:56:42,460 --> 00:56:46,570
And so what happens is that
the industry uses concoctions,

1795
00:56:46,590 --> 00:56:47,310
you know,

1796
00:56:47,310 --> 00:56:47,950
um,

1797
00:56:47,950 --> 00:56:48,470
from,

1798
00:56:48,470 --> 00:56:51,640
from something as benign
as chlorine all the way to,

1799
00:56:52,020 --> 00:56:52,690
you know,

1800
00:56:52,690 --> 00:56:56,470
a stiffer stuff to try to sanitize clean,

1801
00:56:56,471 --> 00:56:57,161
wash down,

1802
00:56:57,161 --> 00:56:57,994
all that stuff.

1803
00:56:58,180 --> 00:57:00,400
But all that does is,

1804
00:57:00,730 --> 00:57:01,563
um,

1805
00:57:01,690 --> 00:57:05,350
is open the door for the survivors.

1806
00:57:05,710 --> 00:57:09,460
And every and every time a
new concoction is developed,

1807
00:57:09,850 --> 00:57:14,020
there are survivors and the survivors
become more and more virulent.

1808
00:57:15,250 --> 00:57:15,731
So that,

1809
00:57:15,731 --> 00:57:16,331
for example,

1810
00:57:16,331 --> 00:57:18,190
when the industry says all look,

1811
00:57:18,220 --> 00:57:19,001
eat coal lie,

1812
00:57:19,001 --> 00:57:20,290
it's been around forever,

1813
00:57:20,291 --> 00:57:21,010
you know,

1814
00:57:21,010 --> 00:57:21,710
get over it.

1815
00:57:21,710 --> 00:57:24,100
A ECOLAB is part of a cow's digestion.

1816
00:57:24,610 --> 00:57:26,140
Well that's true,

1817
00:57:26,410 --> 00:57:31,410
but not the virulent strains that we're
developing by feeding unnatural feeds

1818
00:57:34,420 --> 00:57:38,440
and the drugs and so were,

1819
00:57:38,441 --> 00:57:42,940
those would normally be fairly benign
in are highly acidic digestive system.

1820
00:57:43,960 --> 00:57:48,960
They become more virulent and they
survive in us instead of us killing them.

1821
00:57:49,900 --> 00:57:51,820
And that's this evolution of things.

1822
00:57:51,821 --> 00:57:52,360
I mean,

1823
00:57:52,360 --> 00:57:52,830
you know,

1824
00:57:52,830 --> 00:57:53,500
uh,

1825
00:57:53,500 --> 00:57:53,861
take,

1826
00:57:53,861 --> 00:57:54,490
um,

1827
00:57:54,490 --> 00:57:54,701
you know,

1828
00:57:54,701 --> 00:57:56,600
Arkansas now where the,

1829
00:57:56,640 --> 00:58:01,640
where the farmers are now budgeting $70
per acre to hand machete super weeds

1830
00:58:05,710 --> 00:58:10,710
that have morphed as a result of
glyphosate roundup because of genetically

1831
00:58:12,011 --> 00:58:13,090
modified organism,

1832
00:58:13,450 --> 00:58:16,360
a corn and soybeans being planted.

1833
00:58:17,380 --> 00:58:17,610
It,

1834
00:58:17,610 --> 00:58:22,610
it's created these survivor
super weeds because everything,

1835
00:58:23,770 --> 00:58:27,070
whenever we try to sterilize or sanitize,

1836
00:58:27,340 --> 00:58:32,320
there are survivors and those survivors
become tougher and tougher and tougher.

1837
00:58:32,890 --> 00:58:33,970
We are a bunch of dummies,

1838
00:58:33,971 --> 00:58:34,804
aren't we?

1839
00:58:35,600 --> 00:58:37,620
I mean really are as a human race.

1840
00:58:37,621 --> 00:58:39,300
We're just a bunch of silly dummies.

1841
00:58:39,690 --> 00:58:40,111
There's a,

1842
00:58:40,111 --> 00:58:40,590
there's a,

1843
00:58:40,590 --> 00:58:41,371
an issue that,

1844
00:58:41,371 --> 00:58:41,880
uh,

1845
00:58:41,880 --> 00:58:45,120
is a big one with antibiotic soaps.

1846
00:58:45,490 --> 00:58:49,140
A lot of people think it's real
smart to wash with antibiotic soaps,

1847
00:58:49,141 --> 00:58:53,520
but what they don't realize
is the antibiotic soaps
kill all the good flora on

1848
00:58:53,521 --> 00:58:54,600
your screen as well.

1849
00:58:54,780 --> 00:58:58,020
And it seems like that's really
similar to what's going on here.

1850
00:58:58,200 --> 00:58:58,760
Absolutely.

1851
00:58:58,760 --> 00:59:02,070
Your talk of the live betting would,

1852
00:59:02,071 --> 00:59:07,071
that is his nature zone way of dealing
with the passages instead of pumping some

1853
00:59:07,171 --> 00:59:08,250
chemicals into them.

1854
00:59:08,710 --> 00:59:09,250
That's right.

1855
00:59:09,250 --> 00:59:11,290
And there's nothing unnatural about it.

1856
00:59:11,291 --> 00:59:11,801
In other words,

1857
00:59:11,801 --> 00:59:12,634
you don't get.

1858
00:59:12,760 --> 00:59:14,560
You don't get virulent survivors.

1859
00:59:14,620 --> 00:59:16,480
They're all on an equal,

1860
00:59:16,760 --> 00:59:17,200
you know,

1861
00:59:17,200 --> 00:59:19,000
a creation playing field,

1862
00:59:19,001 --> 00:59:19,834
if you will.

1863
00:59:19,910 --> 00:59:20,110
And,

1864
00:59:20,110 --> 00:59:20,620
and,

1865
00:59:20,620 --> 00:59:21,080
and,

1866
00:59:21,080 --> 00:59:21,820
and all.

1867
00:59:21,820 --> 00:59:25,580
And our responsibility then
is simply to create a habitat

1868
00:59:27,350 --> 00:59:28,460
that allows this,

1869
00:59:28,490 --> 00:59:28,851
this,

1870
00:59:28,851 --> 00:59:29,360
um,

1871
00:59:29,360 --> 00:59:32,210
battlefield to play out
in its natural setting.

1872
00:59:32,810 --> 00:59:36,650
Natural setting is the key because
there is a sort of a give and take,

1873
00:59:36,651 --> 00:59:37,191
a place,

1874
00:59:37,191 --> 00:59:42,191
a jigsaw puzzle piece place for
all the various elements of a farm,

1875
00:59:42,951 --> 00:59:44,150
of an ecosystem.

1876
00:59:44,630 --> 00:59:46,430
And that's what you're
addressing when you're.

1877
00:59:46,431 --> 00:59:48,730
That's when I found so
incredibly fascinating about the,

1878
00:59:48,760 --> 00:59:53,510
the idea of continuing to
move these animals and you
have these very low voltage

1879
00:59:53,511 --> 00:59:55,250
electric fences that are just enough.

1880
00:59:55,400 --> 00:59:56,091
So they go up,

1881
00:59:56,091 --> 00:59:57,110
I don't want to go near there.

1882
00:59:57,140 --> 00:59:58,070
No one's getting hurt,

1883
00:59:58,071 --> 00:59:58,904
but they're like,

1884
00:59:58,910 --> 00:59:59,151
no,

1885
00:59:59,151 --> 00:59:59,371
it's,

1886
00:59:59,371 --> 00:59:59,650
it's,

1887
00:59:59,650 --> 00:59:59,870
it's,

1888
00:59:59,870 --> 01:00:00,070
it's,

1889
01:00:00,070 --> 01:00:04,490
it's called a psychological barrier
to essentially car battery you use,

1890
01:00:04,491 --> 01:00:04,820
right?

1891
01:00:04,820 --> 01:00:05,710
So it's portable.

1892
01:00:05,720 --> 01:00:06,000
Well,

1893
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:06,833
it's an energy.

1894
01:00:06,950 --> 01:00:07,710
It's a car battery,

1895
01:00:07,710 --> 01:00:08,451
power car,

1896
01:00:08,451 --> 01:00:08,980
battery

1897
01:00:08,980 --> 01:00:09,850
and energizer.

1898
01:00:10,040 --> 01:00:10,300
Uh,

1899
01:00:10,300 --> 01:00:12,190
it has high voltage but no amperage.

1900
01:00:12,670 --> 01:00:13,181
So,

1901
01:00:13,181 --> 01:00:13,401
you know,

1902
01:00:13,401 --> 01:00:14,620
you get a lot of pain,

1903
01:00:14,920 --> 01:00:17,200
but there's no danger
because you're running like,

1904
01:00:17,240 --> 01:00:18,020
you know,

1905
01:00:18,020 --> 01:00:18,790
uh,

1906
01:00:18,790 --> 01:00:19,240
goodness,

1907
01:00:19,240 --> 01:00:19,780
uh,

1908
01:00:19,780 --> 01:00:20,110
you know,

1909
01:00:20,110 --> 01:00:20,943
uh,

1910
01:00:21,270 --> 01:00:22,630
a 20th of an amp.

1911
01:00:22,870 --> 01:00:23,231
Okay.

1912
01:00:23,231 --> 01:00:23,620
I mean there's,

1913
01:00:23,620 --> 01:00:24,640
there's no energy,

1914
01:00:25,030 --> 01:00:25,700
but there's a.

1915
01:00:25,700 --> 01:00:26,030
but,

1916
01:00:26,030 --> 01:00:27,100
but there's a lot of pressure.

1917
01:00:27,520 --> 01:00:28,353
Uh,

1918
01:00:28,510 --> 01:00:29,560
and so,

1919
01:00:29,620 --> 01:00:30,040
um,

1920
01:00:30,040 --> 01:00:30,560
so,

1921
01:00:30,560 --> 01:00:30,850
you know,

1922
01:00:30,850 --> 01:00:31,510
these systems,

1923
01:00:31,510 --> 01:00:32,080
again,

1924
01:00:32,080 --> 01:00:33,820
these are computer microchip systems.

1925
01:00:34,060 --> 01:00:34,470
So,

1926
01:00:34,470 --> 01:00:34,650
you know,

1927
01:00:34,650 --> 01:00:35,141
I think,

1928
01:00:35,141 --> 01:00:36,610
I think as we've talked about,

1929
01:00:36,611 --> 01:00:38,470
how did the factory farm develop?

1930
01:00:38,770 --> 01:00:39,700
I think perhaps,

1931
01:00:39,730 --> 01:00:40,030
you know,

1932
01:00:40,030 --> 01:00:43,090
rather than a continuum,

1933
01:00:43,940 --> 01:00:45,820
you can go wherever you
want to with the questions.

1934
01:00:46,180 --> 01:00:51,180
But I would like to to point out to folks
that as bad as that is and depressing

1935
01:00:52,961 --> 01:00:53,381
and yeah,

1936
01:00:53,381 --> 01:00:54,760
we're a bunch of dummies and all that.

1937
01:00:55,180 --> 01:00:56,013
My goodness,

1938
01:00:56,230 --> 01:01:01,230
we have now innovated the most amazing
infrastructure to be able for the first

1939
01:01:05,561 --> 01:01:10,561
time in human history to
caress our Earth Nest,

1940
01:01:11,950 --> 01:01:12,521
our lover,

1941
01:01:12,521 --> 01:01:13,354
if you will,

1942
01:01:14,530 --> 01:01:19,530
more strategically and
purposely purposefully than
we have ever been able to do

1943
01:01:22,361 --> 01:01:23,194
it before.

1944
01:01:23,260 --> 01:01:26,260
And the tech and the
infrastructure is amazing.

1945
01:01:26,380 --> 01:01:27,850
One is electric fencing.

1946
01:01:28,090 --> 01:01:29,810
I mean you can now in,

1947
01:01:29,940 --> 01:01:32,350
in a wheelbarrow full of material,

1948
01:01:32,830 --> 01:01:37,830
you can now place hundreds of thousands
of animals in a certain spot for a day

1949
01:01:43,420 --> 01:01:43,780
and,

1950
01:01:43,780 --> 01:01:44,613
and,

1951
01:01:44,680 --> 01:01:45,190
and,

1952
01:01:45,190 --> 01:01:50,190
and manage carefully their intersection
with a given piece of nature that's,

1953
01:01:50,890 --> 01:01:51,940
that's unprecedented.

1954
01:01:51,941 --> 01:01:52,960
We've never been able to do that before.

1955
01:01:53,310 --> 01:01:55,420
I'm week and we can protect them.

1956
01:01:55,450 --> 01:02:00,450
We can make them comfortable not
with stationary barns and you know,

1957
01:02:00,700 --> 01:02:01,840
big post and beam,

1958
01:02:01,841 --> 01:02:02,021
you know,

1959
01:02:02,021 --> 01:02:03,940
you have to cut down the
whole forest to do this.

1960
01:02:04,270 --> 01:02:09,270
But now with bandsaw band
saw a technology instead of,

1961
01:02:10,451 --> 01:02:10,601
you know,

1962
01:02:10,601 --> 01:02:14,560
the big old circular saws that
removed a quarter of an inch per cut.

1963
01:02:14,990 --> 01:02:18,100
I'm now with a little Honda engine that,

1964
01:02:18,320 --> 01:02:21,930
that saps that's just sips fuel and uh,

1965
01:02:21,990 --> 01:02:23,940
and a one 10th of an inch thick,

1966
01:02:24,510 --> 01:02:25,730
a bandsaw.

1967
01:02:26,010 --> 01:02:29,940
We can now mill tinker toy,

1968
01:02:29,941 --> 01:02:34,941
like lab structure material
to build very lightweight,

1969
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:37,890
portable barnes,

1970
01:02:37,950 --> 01:02:39,120
portable shelters.

1971
01:02:39,540 --> 01:02:40,070
So we,

1972
01:02:40,070 --> 01:02:41,160
we use those on our farm.

1973
01:02:41,161 --> 01:02:44,040
We have all these portable
infrastructures for Turkeys,

1974
01:02:44,041 --> 01:02:44,551
chickens,

1975
01:02:44,551 --> 01:02:45,120
cows,

1976
01:02:45,120 --> 01:02:45,890
pigs,

1977
01:02:45,890 --> 01:02:46,723
um,

1978
01:02:47,760 --> 01:02:52,760
so that we can move a shade tree or a
barn protective shelter with the animals,

1979
01:02:56,520 --> 01:02:57,510
with a four wheeler,

1980
01:02:57,530 --> 01:02:58,363
uh,

1981
01:02:58,370 --> 01:02:59,060
you know,

1982
01:02:59,060 --> 01:03:00,900
a couple of guys pushing it along.

1983
01:03:00,901 --> 01:03:01,734
Okay.

1984
01:03:02,430 --> 01:03:04,560
This portable infrastructure then,

1985
01:03:06,060 --> 01:03:06,750
um,

1986
01:03:06,750 --> 01:03:11,750
allows us to keep the animals
controlled and comfortable.

1987
01:03:12,540 --> 01:03:14,850
And with black pipe black pipe,

1988
01:03:15,060 --> 01:03:18,690
we can les miles with black
power black plastic pipe.

1989
01:03:18,840 --> 01:03:19,590
Okay.

1990
01:03:19,590 --> 01:03:24,590
We can now develop a pond or a
spring and put that water in a nice,

1991
01:03:26,641 --> 01:03:27,474
clean,

1992
01:03:27,570 --> 01:03:28,030
you know,

1993
01:03:28,030 --> 01:03:29,010
delivery system,

1994
01:03:29,450 --> 01:03:33,000
like the plumbing in your
house and deliver it miles.

1995
01:03:33,480 --> 01:03:34,590
So the animals aren't,

1996
01:03:34,990 --> 01:03:35,430
you know,

1997
01:03:35,430 --> 01:03:36,840
drinking out of their toilet.

1998
01:03:36,841 --> 01:03:37,171
They're not,

1999
01:03:37,171 --> 01:03:37,411
you know,

2000
01:03:37,411 --> 01:03:39,540
pooping and in drinking
out of it and all that,

2001
01:03:39,541 --> 01:03:41,730
like you see that they're actually eating.

2002
01:03:42,590 --> 01:03:44,220
I drink out of the cal troughs.

2003
01:03:44,250 --> 01:03:44,491
I mean,

2004
01:03:44,491 --> 01:03:46,620
that water's clean enough for me to drink.

2005
01:03:46,770 --> 01:03:47,603
You drink out of that.

2006
01:03:47,640 --> 01:03:49,530
Absolutely owe it.

2007
01:03:49,590 --> 01:03:51,180
It builds up your immune system.

2008
01:03:51,720 --> 01:03:52,553
Oh,

2009
01:03:53,180 --> 01:03:54,960
system does it.

2010
01:03:55,080 --> 01:03:55,913
Yeah.

2011
01:03:55,980 --> 01:03:56,320
Yeah.

2012
01:03:56,320 --> 01:03:57,300
You ever get sick?

2013
01:03:58,080 --> 01:03:58,913
You know,

2014
01:03:59,270 --> 01:04:00,150
knock on wood.

2015
01:04:00,151 --> 01:04:01,800
I haven't been sick for years.

2016
01:04:01,801 --> 01:04:04,710
I don't remember the last
time I was sick with a cold.

2017
01:04:05,070 --> 01:04:05,540
Really?

2018
01:04:05,540 --> 01:04:05,880
Yeah.

2019
01:04:05,880 --> 01:04:06,680
Will it really?

2020
01:04:06,680 --> 01:04:06,961
I mean,

2021
01:04:06,961 --> 01:04:08,700
I'll take a lot of vitamin C every day.

2022
01:04:09,090 --> 01:04:09,511
Um,

2023
01:04:09,511 --> 01:04:09,661
you know,

2024
01:04:09,661 --> 01:04:10,441
ascorbic acid.

2025
01:04:10,441 --> 01:04:11,041
I'd take my,

2026
01:04:11,041 --> 01:04:11,210
uh,

2027
01:04:11,210 --> 01:04:11,410
you know,

2028
01:04:11,410 --> 01:04:16,120
Dopa tropic for keep me from
going crazy with still patrol.

2029
01:04:17,280 --> 01:04:17,930
It's a,

2030
01:04:17,930 --> 01:04:19,260
it's an urban mix.

2031
01:04:19,440 --> 01:04:20,273
It,

2032
01:04:20,700 --> 01:04:20,941
you know,

2033
01:04:20,941 --> 01:04:21,201
it,

2034
01:04:21,201 --> 01:04:22,860
it's related to dopamine and stuff,

2035
01:04:22,861 --> 01:04:23,090
but it,

2036
01:04:23,090 --> 01:04:23,250
it,

2037
01:04:23,250 --> 01:04:23,760
it's a,

2038
01:04:23,760 --> 01:04:24,593
it's a calmer.

2039
01:04:25,260 --> 01:04:26,093
It's a CA.

2040
01:04:26,480 --> 01:04:30,390
I travel so much now that in
such an unnatural environment,

2041
01:04:30,860 --> 01:04:31,210
you know,

2042
01:04:31,210 --> 01:04:31,370
I,

2043
01:04:31,370 --> 01:04:32,820
I was starting a couple years ago,

2044
01:04:32,821 --> 01:04:36,570
I was starting into a kind of a fight
or flight subconscious fight or flight

2045
01:04:36,571 --> 01:04:37,404
thing where I would get,

2046
01:04:37,410 --> 01:04:38,280
I couldn't breathe,

2047
01:04:38,281 --> 01:04:38,441
you know,

2048
01:04:38,441 --> 01:04:40,050
on our airplane and stuff because it was,

2049
01:04:40,500 --> 01:04:40,970
and,

2050
01:04:40,970 --> 01:04:41,500
and you know,

2051
01:04:41,500 --> 01:04:44,510
I'd get all congested and all this and uh,

2052
01:04:44,610 --> 01:04:45,443
I went to a,

2053
01:04:45,570 --> 01:04:49,400
went to a quack and alternative
medical practitioner that,

2054
01:04:49,710 --> 01:04:52,350
that uses the kind of
machines they use in Europe.

2055
01:04:52,550 --> 01:04:52,761
You know,

2056
01:04:52,761 --> 01:04:56,610
when you go to the emergency
room in Europe and you grab
two probes and a little

2057
01:04:56,611 --> 01:04:57,110
needle,

2058
01:04:57,110 --> 01:04:57,340
you know,

2059
01:04:57,340 --> 01:04:58,520
tells you everything
that's wrong with you,

2060
01:04:58,700 --> 01:04:59,310
you know,

2061
01:04:59,310 --> 01:05:00,450
it costs like pennies,

2062
01:05:00,480 --> 01:05:00,950
you know,

2063
01:05:00,950 --> 01:05:01,380
I mean,

2064
01:05:01,380 --> 01:05:04,500
that's how they can get along
with government healthcare
because they actually

2065
01:05:04,501 --> 01:05:05,430
are smart about it.

2066
01:05:05,670 --> 01:05:05,881
You know,

2067
01:05:05,881 --> 01:05:08,640
when these probes you hold on with your
hands and they tell you what's wrong

2068
01:05:08,641 --> 01:05:08,940
with you.

2069
01:05:08,940 --> 01:05:09,421
Intelligent.

2070
01:05:09,421 --> 01:05:09,840
Yeah.

2071
01:05:09,840 --> 01:05:10,021
Yeah.

2072
01:05:10,021 --> 01:05:10,190
No,

2073
01:05:10,190 --> 01:05:11,023
it's pretty cool.

2074
01:05:11,280 --> 01:05:11,990
Anyway,

2075
01:05:11,990 --> 01:05:13,790
I mean it's not endorsed by any medical.

2076
01:05:14,430 --> 01:05:14,611
Oh,

2077
01:05:14,611 --> 01:05:15,630
absolutely.

2078
01:05:15,960 --> 01:05:16,793
Listen,

2079
01:05:17,620 --> 01:05:18,310
called.

2080
01:05:18,310 --> 01:05:19,420
I thought it was funny too.

2081
01:05:19,421 --> 01:05:20,830
I went from my first visit,

2082
01:05:21,370 --> 01:05:22,240
I sat down,

2083
01:05:22,990 --> 01:05:27,590
she said somewhere in
your background you had a.

2084
01:05:27,940 --> 01:05:30,160
You had a bladder issue,

2085
01:05:30,161 --> 01:05:30,994
didn't you?

2086
01:05:32,060 --> 01:05:32,651
I didn't,

2087
01:05:32,651 --> 01:05:33,670
I hadn't said a word.

2088
01:05:33,940 --> 01:05:34,271
I mean,

2089
01:05:34,271 --> 01:05:36,700
I'm 57 right when I was.

2090
01:05:37,420 --> 01:05:38,320
How old was I?

2091
01:05:38,470 --> 01:05:39,303
Eight.

2092
01:05:40,060 --> 01:05:42,850
I had a malfunctioning kidney valve

2093
01:05:44,380 --> 01:05:44,950
malfunction.

2094
01:05:44,950 --> 01:05:46,570
Kidney Valve almost died.

2095
01:05:47,090 --> 01:05:48,070
I mean this was long time ago,

2096
01:05:48,071 --> 01:05:48,430
right?

2097
01:05:48,430 --> 01:05:51,760
It went in with surgery and
repaired that valve board.

2098
01:05:51,780 --> 01:05:52,091
It was doing,

2099
01:05:52,091 --> 01:05:56,230
it was letting my urine backup for
my bladder backup into the kid.

2100
01:05:56,260 --> 01:05:57,670
It's a one way check valve.

2101
01:05:57,880 --> 01:05:58,713
Okay.

2102
01:05:58,750 --> 01:06:00,340
So your bladder is under pressure,

2103
01:06:00,341 --> 01:06:01,174
right?

2104
01:06:01,280 --> 01:06:01,600
And,

2105
01:06:01,600 --> 01:06:01,960
and,

2106
01:06:01,960 --> 01:06:04,570
and that you're in is supposed
to only go one direction.

2107
01:06:04,780 --> 01:06:05,613
All right.

2108
01:06:05,710 --> 01:06:06,491
Into the bladder.

2109
01:06:06,491 --> 01:06:06,791
Well,

2110
01:06:06,791 --> 01:06:11,770
I had one malfunctioning valve that was
letting as the bladder filled up with

2111
01:06:11,771 --> 01:06:12,191
pressure.

2112
01:06:12,191 --> 01:06:16,270
It was the balloon was pushing
the urine back up into the kidney.

2113
01:06:16,600 --> 01:06:17,230
All right.

2114
01:06:17,230 --> 01:06:18,730
So they went in and repaired it anyway,

2115
01:06:19,540 --> 01:06:19,890
in,

2116
01:06:19,890 --> 01:06:20,230
in,

2117
01:06:20,230 --> 01:06:21,220
in 10 minutes,

2118
01:06:21,310 --> 01:06:24,550
her machine picked up that which was,

2119
01:06:24,570 --> 01:06:24,820
you know,

2120
01:06:24,820 --> 01:06:25,520
50 year,

2121
01:06:25,520 --> 01:06:26,590
a 50 year old,

2122
01:06:26,770 --> 01:06:27,370
whatever,

2123
01:06:27,370 --> 01:06:27,760
you know,

2124
01:06:27,760 --> 01:06:28,900
bodily injury,

2125
01:06:29,040 --> 01:06:29,760
you know,

2126
01:06:29,760 --> 01:06:30,593
problem.

2127
01:06:30,960 --> 01:06:31,660
Um,

2128
01:06:31,660 --> 01:06:31,860
and,

2129
01:06:31,860 --> 01:06:32,440
and boy,

2130
01:06:32,440 --> 01:06:33,273
you know,

2131
01:06:33,840 --> 01:06:35,520
I sat up and saluted at that point,

2132
01:06:35,521 --> 01:06:36,354
you know,

2133
01:06:36,380 --> 01:06:38,070
this is what's the machine called?

2134
01:06:38,260 --> 01:06:39,560
I don't know what the machine's called.

2135
01:06:39,780 --> 01:06:40,200
If,

2136
01:06:40,200 --> 01:06:40,330
uh,

2137
01:06:40,330 --> 01:06:40,871
if I,

2138
01:06:40,871 --> 01:06:41,460
if I,

2139
01:06:41,460 --> 01:06:44,580
if I knew more about it than somebody
would come after me and put me in jail.

2140
01:06:44,581 --> 01:06:45,620
PROAC watches.

2141
01:06:45,660 --> 01:06:48,330
Is that the same machine right here?

2142
01:06:48,810 --> 01:06:50,910
It says that that's one of the machines.

2143
01:06:50,911 --> 01:06:52,710
There's different kinds of models of it,

2144
01:06:53,070 --> 01:06:53,903
I'm guessing.

2145
01:06:53,910 --> 01:06:54,330
Yeah.

2146
01:06:54,330 --> 01:06:56,790
Were there to quack watch though?

2147
01:06:56,880 --> 01:06:58,740
This is a website that
saying it's a quack.

2148
01:07:01,560 --> 01:07:01,741
Well,

2149
01:07:01,741 --> 01:07:03,180
I don't know if it's that machine or not.

2150
01:07:03,530 --> 01:07:06,930
I don't want to tell you who
she is because she probably
get put in jail if you

2151
01:07:06,931 --> 01:07:07,591
knew who she was.

2152
01:07:07,591 --> 01:07:10,090
But really she gets on the Ama.

2153
01:07:10,370 --> 01:07:10,610
Well,

2154
01:07:10,610 --> 01:07:11,061
yeah,

2155
01:07:11,061 --> 01:07:11,894
I mean,

2156
01:07:12,060 --> 01:07:12,810
uh,

2157
01:07:12,810 --> 01:07:13,040
you know,

2158
01:07:13,040 --> 01:07:14,930
the Ama goes after people.

2159
01:07:15,560 --> 01:07:16,161
My goodness,

2160
01:07:16,161 --> 01:07:18,700
they go after raw milk
producers and backyard chicken

2161
01:07:18,710 --> 01:07:19,431
can growers.

2162
01:07:19,431 --> 01:07:20,060
And that's,

2163
01:07:20,060 --> 01:07:21,650
that is a true story.

2164
01:07:21,740 --> 01:07:22,970
That's a true fact.

2165
01:07:23,030 --> 01:07:26,660
The Orthodoxy Orthodoxy.

2166
01:07:26,661 --> 01:07:28,400
That's really crazy today.

2167
01:07:28,790 --> 01:07:29,830
And of course you know,

2168
01:07:29,870 --> 01:07:33,380
we're heretics and the
inquisition is very real.

2169
01:07:33,800 --> 01:07:34,191
Yeah.

2170
01:07:34,191 --> 01:07:38,750
Fooling patients with computerized
magic eight balls on if that's the same

2171
01:07:38,751 --> 01:07:39,584
thing.

2172
01:07:40,350 --> 01:07:40,800
I,

2173
01:07:40,800 --> 01:07:41,240
I,

2174
01:07:41,240 --> 01:07:41,330
I have

2175
01:07:41,330 --> 01:07:42,080
no idea.

2176
01:07:42,080 --> 01:07:42,311
I,

2177
01:07:42,311 --> 01:07:45,380
I purposely try to not know all about it.

2178
01:07:45,381 --> 01:07:47,720
So that means a real craziness.

2179
01:07:47,980 --> 01:07:49,560
If you've ever seen the uh,

2180
01:07:49,940 --> 01:07:51,980
there was a story recently where they,

2181
01:07:52,250 --> 01:07:52,600
they,

2182
01:07:52,600 --> 01:07:56,540
they arrested people like with a
swat team for selling raw milk.

2183
01:07:57,230 --> 01:07:57,950
I mean they,

2184
01:07:57,950 --> 01:07:58,300
they,

2185
01:07:58,300 --> 01:08:02,330
they broke down doors and they had guns
and they were wearing bulletproof vests

2186
01:08:02,331 --> 01:08:02,951
and they're just,

2187
01:08:02,951 --> 01:08:05,660
they're just a farm milk.

2188
01:08:05,930 --> 01:08:07,010
And then somehow or another,

2189
01:08:07,011 --> 01:08:11,420
because we've made milk so toxic because
of these environments that you're

2190
01:08:11,421 --> 01:08:13,520
describing that you would,

2191
01:08:13,521 --> 01:08:14,930
you drink raw milk on a

2192
01:08:16,760 --> 01:08:17,181
farm,

2193
01:08:17,181 --> 01:08:19,810
like your farm where the cows are healthy.

2194
01:08:19,820 --> 01:08:23,630
I mean you could drink that raw milk
and it's actually easily digested.

2195
01:08:23,631 --> 01:08:25,340
Your body digests it far more easy.

2196
01:08:25,341 --> 01:08:29,150
And a lot of people that are even lactose
intolerant don't have a problem with

2197
01:08:29,151 --> 01:08:29,930
the raw milk.

2198
01:08:29,930 --> 01:08:30,320
Right.

2199
01:08:30,320 --> 01:08:30,631
And,

2200
01:08:30,631 --> 01:08:30,980
and the,

2201
01:08:30,980 --> 01:08:31,161
you know,

2202
01:08:31,161 --> 01:08:33,530
the milk from an industrial farm is toxic.

2203
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:35,270
It does have a lot of problems.

2204
01:08:35,450 --> 01:08:39,350
A lot of people don't realize
that the Mayo Clinic was built.

2205
01:08:39,410 --> 01:08:39,651
I mean,

2206
01:08:39,651 --> 01:08:44,360
it started back during the
early time of the century when,

2207
01:08:44,630 --> 01:08:45,290
um,

2208
01:08:45,290 --> 01:08:47,540
when cows were eating brewery brewery,

2209
01:08:47,541 --> 01:08:49,430
waste distiller's grains
because they were,

2210
01:08:49,670 --> 01:08:50,030
you know,

2211
01:08:50,030 --> 01:08:51,170
without refrigeration,

2212
01:08:52,100 --> 01:08:53,260
you put the,

2213
01:08:53,350 --> 01:08:58,350
they put the breweries and
the cows together and in
these urban sectors and you

2214
01:08:58,771 --> 01:08:58,850
know,

2215
01:08:58,850 --> 01:09:01,340
they didn't understand bacteria
and hygiene and sanitation,

2216
01:09:01,341 --> 01:09:01,970
all that stuff.

2217
01:09:01,970 --> 01:09:05,180
So the cows got a brucellosis
and all these things,

2218
01:09:05,181 --> 01:09:06,170
pass it onto people.

2219
01:09:07,130 --> 01:09:12,130
And Mayo clinic started putting cows
back on pasture and feeding raw milk to

2220
01:09:13,911 --> 01:09:18,230
their patients during the time when
people were getting sick from urban

2221
01:09:18,260 --> 01:09:21,680
industrial swill fed cow milk.

2222
01:09:22,370 --> 01:09:24,710
And that's how Mayo
Clinic actually started.

2223
01:09:25,190 --> 01:09:27,700
So that's a um,

2224
01:09:28,280 --> 01:09:28,800
yeah,

2225
01:09:28,800 --> 01:09:29,180
I mean,

2226
01:09:29,180 --> 01:09:29,881
raw milk is a,

2227
01:09:29,881 --> 01:09:30,920
is a wonderful,

2228
01:09:30,950 --> 01:09:31,670
uh,

2229
01:09:31,670 --> 01:09:32,121
material,

2230
01:09:32,121 --> 01:09:34,820
but the cow has to be treated like a cow,

2231
01:09:34,850 --> 01:09:35,001
you know,

2232
01:09:35,001 --> 01:09:36,860
you have to respect
her countless as a cow.

2233
01:09:36,890 --> 01:09:38,570
That's how I picked their countless.

2234
01:09:38,840 --> 01:09:39,800
That's how,

2235
01:09:39,830 --> 01:09:40,663
that's how you get.

2236
01:09:40,850 --> 01:09:41,301
You don't,

2237
01:09:41,301 --> 01:09:44,330
you don't get to all the milkiness of
milk if you don't respect the counters of

2238
01:09:44,331 --> 01:09:45,040
the cow.

2239
01:09:45,040 --> 01:09:45,710
Right?

2240
01:09:45,710 --> 01:09:50,710
And so what's happened is
that the industry is so
filthy and pathogen and toxic

2241
01:09:52,340 --> 01:09:52,850
that,

2242
01:09:52,850 --> 01:09:53,683
um,

2243
01:09:54,680 --> 01:09:55,220
you know,

2244
01:09:55,220 --> 01:09:58,700
and people fear food because they're,

2245
01:09:59,030 --> 01:10:00,470
the average person is fearful of food.

2246
01:10:00,471 --> 01:10:04,930
I mean the average person is far more
informed about the latest dysfunction and

2247
01:10:04,931 --> 01:10:06,590
the carnation household than they are,

2248
01:10:06,591 --> 01:10:07,230
you know,

2249
01:10:07,230 --> 01:10:07,490
uh,

2250
01:10:07,490 --> 01:10:10,430
what's going to become flesh with their
flesh and bone of their bones at 6:00.

2251
01:10:10,460 --> 01:10:12,340
I liked how you pronounced it card.

2252
01:10:13,710 --> 01:10:15,380
It shows you really don't

2253
01:10:16,940 --> 01:10:17,540
know.

2254
01:10:17,540 --> 01:10:18,350
I don't.

2255
01:10:18,350 --> 01:10:19,700
So whatever they are,

2256
01:10:19,730 --> 01:10:21,650
whoever they are exactly.

2257
01:10:22,330 --> 01:10:25,130
Still asking though,

2258
01:10:25,990 --> 01:10:26,823
but

2259
01:10:28,050 --> 01:10:28,731
it's all about.

2260
01:10:28,731 --> 01:10:30,300
So you need to put a button on TV.

2261
01:10:30,330 --> 01:10:31,163
People Watch.

2262
01:10:31,610 --> 01:10:33,650
So the point is though,

2263
01:10:33,800 --> 01:10:37,700
that people are so paranoid of
food and ignorant about food,

2264
01:10:37,880 --> 01:10:39,020
that they fear food today.

2265
01:10:39,080 --> 01:10:39,410
People,

2266
01:10:39,410 --> 01:10:44,280
I mean we have customers call us
up if I thought chicken in a sink.

2267
01:10:44,281 --> 01:10:45,380
Well it gets Salmonella.

2268
01:10:45,520 --> 01:10:45,740
You know,

2269
01:10:45,740 --> 01:10:46,850
I mean there's a.

2270
01:10:47,170 --> 01:10:52,170
If there's a profound ignorance in our
culture regarding food because we're

2271
01:10:52,731 --> 01:10:53,750
disconnected from it.

2272
01:10:54,020 --> 01:10:57,890
And so afraid people asked for
security from the government.

2273
01:10:57,891 --> 01:10:58,970
Well the government says,

2274
01:10:59,180 --> 01:10:59,421
well,

2275
01:10:59,421 --> 01:11:01,190
let's see what should be our protocols.

2276
01:11:01,340 --> 01:11:06,340
They go to the industry for the answers
and concoct an orthodoxy that actually

2277
01:11:08,301 --> 01:11:11,600
shuts out the antidote for the very
problems they're trying to solve.

2278
01:11:11,780 --> 01:11:14,910
The idea that the government would have
any solutions whatsoever to that it's

2279
01:11:14,911 --> 01:11:18,210
pretty ridiculous in the first place
because who would be the person that would

2280
01:11:18,211 --> 01:11:19,980
be an expert on this?

2281
01:11:20,160 --> 01:11:22,230
Would it be the industry that,

2282
01:11:22,260 --> 01:11:22,951
that creates?

2283
01:11:22,951 --> 01:11:27,450
A lot of these problems we need is a
guy like you working for the government.

2284
01:11:28,120 --> 01:11:28,731
Oh,

2285
01:11:28,731 --> 01:11:32,610
I wouldn't work if I got chosen
to work for the government.

2286
01:11:32,611 --> 01:11:34,350
Whatever agency I was in charge of,

2287
01:11:34,600 --> 01:11:34,780
uh,

2288
01:11:34,780 --> 01:11:36,470
I'd shut it down before Sundance.

2289
01:11:38,550 --> 01:11:39,570
What would you do if,

2290
01:11:39,930 --> 01:11:40,600
let's say,

2291
01:11:40,600 --> 01:11:45,600
let's say there's some catastrophic
failure of our government and they just

2292
01:11:45,901 --> 01:11:49,650
decided to quit and everybody just decided
to go under and we need to figure out

2293
01:11:49,651 --> 01:11:51,510
how to regulate farms.

2294
01:11:51,690 --> 01:11:52,523
Um,

2295
01:11:52,530 --> 01:11:52,920
what,

2296
01:11:52,920 --> 01:11:53,430
what would,

2297
01:11:53,430 --> 01:11:54,270
what could be done?

2298
01:11:54,300 --> 01:11:55,440
What can be done at this point?

2299
01:11:55,441 --> 01:11:55,681
I mean,

2300
01:11:55,681 --> 01:11:55,821
you,

2301
01:11:55,821 --> 01:11:55,991
you,

2302
01:11:55,991 --> 01:11:58,810
you suggesting that the
factory farms there,

2303
01:11:58,820 --> 01:11:59,110
there,

2304
01:11:59,110 --> 01:12:00,300
there's no retrofit.

2305
01:12:00,301 --> 01:12:04,090
They shouldn't be destroyed and be better
off building miniature golf courses

2306
01:12:04,110 --> 01:12:04,381
over.

2307
01:12:04,381 --> 01:12:05,100
Um,

2308
01:12:05,100 --> 01:12:10,100
how would we be able to distribute
food to a nation of hungry people?

2309
01:12:10,170 --> 01:12:12,450
Is it possible to use your methods,

2310
01:12:12,660 --> 01:12:13,740
the methods you use,

2311
01:12:13,741 --> 01:12:15,540
and how big is your farm in Virginia?

2312
01:12:15,660 --> 01:12:15,871
Well,

2313
01:12:15,871 --> 01:12:19,190
we own 550 acres and we
leased another nine farms.

2314
01:12:19,191 --> 01:12:19,451
So we're,

2315
01:12:19,451 --> 01:12:21,120
we're running 2000 acres.

2316
01:12:21,490 --> 01:12:21,900
Uh,

2317
01:12:21,900 --> 01:12:22,230
and,

2318
01:12:22,230 --> 01:12:23,910
and we're producing,

2319
01:12:23,940 --> 01:12:25,500
we're producing a lot of food.

2320
01:12:25,501 --> 01:12:25,980
In fact,

2321
01:12:25,980 --> 01:12:26,340
you know,

2322
01:12:26,340 --> 01:12:27,120
we,

2323
01:12:27,120 --> 01:12:32,120
we surpassed the county
average in production on
passenger by about threefold.

2324
01:12:32,570 --> 01:12:33,510
A threefold amount,

2325
01:12:33,540 --> 01:12:34,710
which is pretty significant.

2326
01:12:34,980 --> 01:12:37,770
So factory farms given
the same amount of space,

2327
01:12:37,771 --> 01:12:38,760
produce less.

2328
01:12:39,180 --> 01:12:39,900
Yeah.

2329
01:12:39,900 --> 01:12:40,351
In fact,

2330
01:12:40,351 --> 01:12:40,531
I mean,

2331
01:12:40,531 --> 01:12:43,110
the thing that's important to realize
when you look at a factory farm,

2332
01:12:43,111 --> 01:12:46,680
when the industry shows this picture
of this big chicken house or this big,

2333
01:12:46,681 --> 01:12:48,610
big factory or hog or,

2334
01:12:48,611 --> 01:12:48,841
or,

2335
01:12:48,841 --> 01:12:49,260
you know,

2336
01:12:49,260 --> 01:12:50,093
calfee lot,

2337
01:12:50,570 --> 01:12:51,403
um,

2338
01:12:51,630 --> 01:12:51,961
or,

2339
01:12:51,961 --> 01:12:52,201
or,

2340
01:12:52,201 --> 01:12:52,291
uh,

2341
01:12:52,291 --> 01:12:52,960
or uh,

2342
01:12:52,960 --> 01:12:53,200
a,

2343
01:12:53,200 --> 01:12:57,960
know a square mile of
strawberries in California.

2344
01:12:58,490 --> 01:12:58,950
Um,

2345
01:12:58,950 --> 01:13:03,870
what you have to understand is those
systems are not standalone islands.

2346
01:13:04,050 --> 01:13:04,860
When they say,

2347
01:13:04,860 --> 01:13:07,200
look at the efficiency
of the small footprint,

2348
01:13:07,380 --> 01:13:09,840
what they're not showing
you are the square miles,

2349
01:13:09,841 --> 01:13:10,674
balls of,

2350
01:13:11,030 --> 01:13:14,720
of subsidized grain or petroleum inputs.

2351
01:13:16,880 --> 01:13:21,880
The land area that all that takes to
sustain that little footprint and then the

2352
01:13:22,461 --> 01:13:27,230
land that it takes to assimilate
all of the waste stream from that.

2353
01:13:27,920 --> 01:13:31,910
So our system doesn't take one more,

2354
01:13:33,800 --> 01:13:37,490
one more square yard of production than,

2355
01:13:38,030 --> 01:13:39,230
than the factory system.

2356
01:13:40,220 --> 01:13:42,770
The fact that we're doing,

2357
01:13:42,850 --> 01:13:43,430
um,

2358
01:13:43,430 --> 01:13:43,671
you know,

2359
01:13:43,671 --> 01:13:44,301
stackable,

2360
01:13:44,301 --> 01:13:44,961
synergistic,

2361
01:13:44,961 --> 01:13:45,561
symbiotic,

2362
01:13:45,561 --> 01:13:48,080
multi speciated enterprises,

2363
01:13:48,320 --> 01:13:49,310
it's more productive.

2364
01:13:49,640 --> 01:13:50,270
But,

2365
01:13:50,270 --> 01:13:50,900
um,

2366
01:13:50,900 --> 01:13:53,240
but when you look at what we're producing,

2367
01:13:53,270 --> 01:13:56,090
even though at first glance,

2368
01:13:56,150 --> 01:13:57,470
the uneducated might say,

2369
01:13:57,471 --> 01:13:57,710
well,

2370
01:13:57,710 --> 01:13:59,840
it takes a lot more land
to produce them this way.

2371
01:14:00,770 --> 01:14:01,603
Actually,

2372
01:14:02,120 --> 01:14:03,620
you're seeing all the land.

2373
01:14:04,070 --> 01:14:04,970
Just like when people say,

2374
01:14:04,971 --> 01:14:05,121
well,

2375
01:14:05,121 --> 01:14:07,610
it takes more people
farming to do it your way.

2376
01:14:07,790 --> 01:14:08,390
Yeah.

2377
01:14:08,390 --> 01:14:09,223
But you know what,

2378
01:14:10,190 --> 01:14:12,970
we don't have fixing pollution areas.

2379
01:14:13,060 --> 01:14:16,260
We don't have people burying
people with C diff and,

2380
01:14:16,350 --> 01:14:16,581
and,

2381
01:14:16,581 --> 01:14:17,414
and Murcia,

2382
01:14:17,640 --> 01:14:18,220
uh,

2383
01:14:18,220 --> 01:14:18,910
we don't know.

2384
01:14:18,910 --> 01:14:23,910
We're not making people sick from
Salmonella and e coli are you with.

2385
01:14:24,040 --> 01:14:24,873
I mean,

2386
01:14:25,110 --> 01:14:25,570
so,

2387
01:14:25,570 --> 01:14:26,710
so in toto,

2388
01:14:26,980 --> 01:14:31,060
all we're doing is taking all the
people that are currently trying to,

2389
01:14:31,410 --> 01:14:32,243
uh,

2390
01:14:32,440 --> 01:14:37,000
trying to triage the collateral
damage of cheap food.

2391
01:14:37,360 --> 01:14:41,140
We're taking all those
people and growing the food

2392
01:14:43,570 --> 01:14:48,570
and all those jobs are coming back
to the farm instead of being in,

2393
01:14:50,370 --> 01:14:50,710
you know,

2394
01:14:50,710 --> 01:14:55,710
and whatever a costly
remedial programs they are.

2395
01:14:56,350 --> 01:14:59,110
So you are essentially
a standalone system,

2396
01:14:59,260 --> 01:15:01,180
whereas when you're seeing a factory farm,

2397
01:15:01,480 --> 01:15:01,970
there's a lot.

2398
01:15:01,970 --> 01:15:04,930
Absolutely not seeing that's
required to make that thing run.

2399
01:15:04,960 --> 01:15:05,531
That's exactly right.

2400
01:15:05,531 --> 01:15:07,660
Now we do buy grain for are omnivores,

2401
01:15:07,661 --> 01:15:08,740
but we buy local,

2402
01:15:08,920 --> 01:15:10,420
GMO free grain,

2403
01:15:10,421 --> 01:15:11,980
no genetically modified organisms.

2404
01:15:12,550 --> 01:15:13,280
And uh,

2405
01:15:13,280 --> 01:15:13,910
and yes,

2406
01:15:13,910 --> 01:15:14,743
um,

2407
01:15:14,850 --> 01:15:15,220
you know,

2408
01:15:15,220 --> 01:15:17,720
the whole idea is to um,

2409
01:15:17,830 --> 01:15:21,090
create a carbon centricity
so that we're not you.

2410
01:15:21,150 --> 01:15:24,550
We're not shipping this stuff all over
the place and when people say all but a

2411
01:15:24,551 --> 01:15:25,930
locality can't produce it.

2412
01:15:26,680 --> 01:15:30,880
Cornell did a fascinating study
several years ago of New York.

2413
01:15:30,910 --> 01:15:32,620
They took every metropolitan city,

2414
01:15:32,621 --> 01:15:32,860
you know,

2415
01:15:32,860 --> 01:15:33,341
Ithaca,

2416
01:15:33,341 --> 01:15:34,001
Syracuse,

2417
01:15:34,001 --> 01:15:34,834
Buffalo,

2418
01:15:34,990 --> 01:15:35,823
Albany,

2419
01:15:36,130 --> 01:15:36,963
New York City,

2420
01:15:37,410 --> 01:15:39,400
and he took all the cities
of New York and said,

2421
01:15:40,540 --> 01:15:44,290
could we produce the calories
for these urban sectors?

2422
01:15:44,550 --> 01:15:45,070
You know,

2423
01:15:45,070 --> 01:15:46,420
how much land would it take?

2424
01:15:46,660 --> 01:15:51,660
And what they found was that every
urban sector could produce all of its

2425
01:15:52,060 --> 01:15:54,460
calories within 30 miles.

2426
01:15:55,030 --> 01:15:57,100
So even in New York,

2427
01:15:57,130 --> 01:15:58,360
it could be standalone,

2428
01:15:58,370 --> 01:15:59,320
self-sufficient,

2429
01:16:00,040 --> 01:16:01,480
except for New York City,

2430
01:16:01,630 --> 01:16:05,620
which if they went into New Jersey it
became self sufficient as well because New

2431
01:16:05,620 --> 01:16:06,453
York's right on the edge of the,

2432
01:16:06,480 --> 01:16:06,740
you know,

2433
01:16:06,740 --> 01:16:07,720
right on the edge of the state.

2434
01:16:08,860 --> 01:16:13,860
And so I'm so a fundamentally integrated
system rather than a segregated system

2435
01:16:15,040 --> 01:16:18,170
becomes far more efficient in,

2436
01:16:18,250 --> 01:16:19,120
in the scheme of things,

2437
01:16:19,121 --> 01:16:22,870
it comes far more efficient than
a segregated system with all this,

2438
01:16:22,890 --> 01:16:23,200
you know,

2439
01:16:23,200 --> 01:16:26,980
all this long distance transportation
because the ships are passing in the

2440
01:16:26,981 --> 01:16:27,280
night.

2441
01:16:27,280 --> 01:16:28,180
That's what's happening.

2442
01:16:28,510 --> 01:16:29,020
You know,

2443
01:16:29,020 --> 01:16:30,670
Iowa produces all this food.

2444
01:16:31,390 --> 01:16:36,390
I will only eat only five percent of the
food that's eaten in Iowa is grown in

2445
01:16:36,461 --> 01:16:37,294
Iowa

2446
01:16:38,700 --> 01:16:42,220
and Iowa is the most fertile
piece of land in the,

2447
01:16:42,221 --> 01:16:43,150
in the planet.

2448
01:16:43,870 --> 01:16:44,620
Why?

2449
01:16:44,620 --> 01:16:47,130
Because they're there.

2450
01:16:47,140 --> 01:16:48,490
They're not producing food.

2451
01:16:48,520 --> 01:16:49,750
There's nothing to eat there.

2452
01:16:50,010 --> 01:16:50,190
You know,

2453
01:16:50,190 --> 01:16:51,023
if you want to eat,

2454
01:16:51,160 --> 01:16:51,480
you know,

2455
01:16:51,480 --> 01:16:53,020
berries and apples and things.

2456
01:16:53,021 --> 01:16:56,020
There has to be imported from somewhere
else because the whole states and corn

2457
01:16:56,021 --> 01:16:56,860
and soybeans,

2458
01:16:57,460 --> 01:16:59,500
this gmo genetically modified things.

2459
01:16:59,501 --> 01:17:00,760
A real hot topic.

2460
01:17:01,300 --> 01:17:02,950
It is genetically modified.

2461
01:17:02,951 --> 01:17:07,951
Seems to me to be along the same lines
of his factory farming idea is that

2462
01:17:08,201 --> 01:17:08,401
you're,

2463
01:17:08,401 --> 01:17:08,840
you,

2464
01:17:08,840 --> 01:17:11,870
instead of looking at it in
a comprehensive approach,

2465
01:17:12,140 --> 01:17:13,220
what you're doing is saying,

2466
01:17:13,221 --> 01:17:13,461
well,

2467
01:17:13,461 --> 01:17:14,271
we got a problem.

2468
01:17:14,271 --> 01:17:16,070
Let's attack that problem with chemicals.

2469
01:17:16,640 --> 01:17:16,941
Yes.

2470
01:17:16,941 --> 01:17:17,280
Well,

2471
01:17:17,280 --> 01:17:17,440
it's,

2472
01:17:17,440 --> 01:17:19,670
it's fundamentally bridging.

2473
01:17:19,730 --> 01:17:20,750
It's fundamentally,

2474
01:17:20,830 --> 01:17:25,830
I'm overrunning a lot of natural barriers
that are there in place to protect,

2475
01:17:31,760 --> 01:17:33,680
to protect happening what is happening,

2476
01:17:33,710 --> 01:17:35,690
which is a,

2477
01:17:36,030 --> 01:17:36,863
um,

2478
01:17:37,160 --> 01:17:40,070
a mishmash of genetic material.

2479
01:17:40,310 --> 01:17:40,951
So you have a,

2480
01:17:40,951 --> 01:17:41,271
you know,

2481
01:17:41,271 --> 01:17:43,190
a salmon that's partly a pepper plant,

2482
01:17:43,220 --> 01:17:43,581
partly,

2483
01:17:43,581 --> 01:17:43,940
uh,

2484
01:17:43,940 --> 01:17:44,140
you know,

2485
01:17:44,140 --> 01:17:46,970
a tropical urban park pig.

2486
01:17:47,090 --> 01:17:47,923
Okay.

2487
01:17:47,960 --> 01:17:48,411
And,

2488
01:17:48,411 --> 01:17:49,090
um,

2489
01:17:49,090 --> 01:17:49,320
and,

2490
01:17:49,320 --> 01:17:50,153
and you talk about,

2491
01:17:50,390 --> 01:17:52,760
you mentioned allergies
a little bit in the past,

2492
01:17:53,050 --> 01:17:53,480
the,

2493
01:17:53,480 --> 01:17:54,313
the,

2494
01:17:54,780 --> 01:17:55,790
when we were kids,

2495
01:17:56,270 --> 01:17:58,550
I didn't know anybody with a food allergy.

2496
01:17:58,640 --> 01:18:00,080
We didn't even know the phrase,

2497
01:18:00,081 --> 01:18:01,670
I never even heard the phrase,

2498
01:18:02,000 --> 01:18:02,630
okay.

2499
01:18:02,630 --> 01:18:04,760
And now it's ubiquitous.

2500
01:18:05,510 --> 01:18:08,600
What's happening is that
we're getting all of this,

2501
01:18:08,630 --> 01:18:09,050
um,

2502
01:18:09,050 --> 01:18:10,300
this Frankenfood,

2503
01:18:11,000 --> 01:18:11,680
uh,

2504
01:18:11,680 --> 01:18:11,900
it,

2505
01:18:11,900 --> 01:18:12,290
it's,

2506
01:18:12,290 --> 01:18:14,330
it's our,

2507
01:18:14,420 --> 01:18:16,250
our internal bacteria.

2508
01:18:16,251 --> 01:18:16,461
You know,

2509
01:18:16,461 --> 01:18:21,461
we've got 3 trillion beings
and our insides and they're
not capable of mutating.

2510
01:18:24,920 --> 01:18:29,920
And I'm assimilating material as fast
as our human brains can adulterate the

2511
01:18:32,511 --> 01:18:33,344
food system.

2512
01:18:34,010 --> 01:18:39,010
And so what happens is we're sending
down there a bunch of foreign material.

2513
01:18:40,370 --> 01:18:41,091
What's this?

2514
01:18:41,091 --> 01:18:41,480
You know,

2515
01:18:41,480 --> 01:18:42,680
I can just see him talking to,

2516
01:18:42,740 --> 01:18:44,470
let's have a board meeting
here and see what that,

2517
01:18:44,530 --> 01:18:45,350
you know,

2518
01:18:45,350 --> 01:18:46,340
gmo corn is.

2519
01:18:46,520 --> 01:18:47,930
And so what happens is,

2520
01:18:47,931 --> 01:18:48,080
you know,

2521
01:18:48,080 --> 01:18:49,100
they can't assimilate it.

2522
01:18:49,940 --> 01:18:54,940
And so the other thing about gmos
is that it is hard to contain,

2523
01:18:55,910 --> 01:18:56,240
you know,

2524
01:18:56,240 --> 01:18:57,980
by nature it's promiscuous.

2525
01:18:58,580 --> 01:19:02,690
So what you have here is a new life form.

2526
01:19:03,170 --> 01:19:03,710
I mean,

2527
01:19:03,710 --> 01:19:04,560
the only thing that,

2528
01:19:04,590 --> 01:19:08,420
that people have been able
to do before now is a mule.

2529
01:19:08,690 --> 01:19:09,010
I'm,

2530
01:19:09,010 --> 01:19:10,760
it's a donkey on a horse.

2531
01:19:12,180 --> 01:19:13,013
Makes a mule.

2532
01:19:14,300 --> 01:19:15,410
But a mule is sterile.

2533
01:19:15,470 --> 01:19:16,640
It's almost like God says,

2534
01:19:16,641 --> 01:19:17,300
all right,

2535
01:19:17,300 --> 01:19:18,200
you can do that,

2536
01:19:18,230 --> 01:19:18,410
you know,

2537
01:19:18,410 --> 01:19:19,550
donkey on horse.

2538
01:19:19,670 --> 01:19:20,300
But that's it.

2539
01:19:20,300 --> 01:19:20,501
You know,

2540
01:19:20,501 --> 01:19:21,830
you're not going to go anymore than that.

2541
01:19:22,670 --> 01:19:24,440
This is not Mendel's peas.

2542
01:19:24,830 --> 01:19:26,240
Mendel was peas on peace.

2543
01:19:26,241 --> 01:19:27,860
He wasn't pees on tomatoes,

2544
01:19:27,861 --> 01:19:28,341
on pigs,

2545
01:19:28,341 --> 01:19:29,174
on monkeys,

2546
01:19:29,300 --> 01:19:29,730
you know,

2547
01:19:29,730 --> 01:19:30,170
it was,

2548
01:19:30,170 --> 01:19:31,880
it was within specie.

2549
01:19:32,390 --> 01:19:34,340
And so this is a,

2550
01:19:34,690 --> 01:19:35,523
um,

2551
01:19:35,640 --> 01:19:36,473
a,

2552
01:19:36,680 --> 01:19:36,940
you know,

2553
01:19:36,940 --> 01:19:41,940
this is an assault on the sexual plumbing
that nature has to maintain genetic

2554
01:19:45,561 --> 01:19:50,561
purity and it seems like the DDT issue
hasn't been factored in as far as the

2555
01:19:51,441 --> 01:19:52,274
longterm,

2556
01:19:52,480 --> 01:19:53,313
if that price.

2557
01:19:53,420 --> 01:19:53,811
That's right.

2558
01:19:53,811 --> 01:19:54,110
Yeah.

2559
01:19:54,110 --> 01:19:55,310
The feeding trials,

2560
01:19:55,460 --> 01:19:57,530
all the feeding trials
have only been like,

2561
01:19:57,560 --> 01:19:57,770
you know,

2562
01:19:57,770 --> 01:19:58,550
60 days,

2563
01:19:58,550 --> 01:20:00,710
60 days is nothing.

2564
01:20:00,980 --> 01:20:01,820
Not only that,

2565
01:20:01,821 --> 01:20:02,870
but if you know the,

2566
01:20:02,900 --> 01:20:07,310
probably the world expert on this as
Jeffrey Smith who wrote seeds of deception

2567
01:20:08,140 --> 01:20:08,640
and is the,

2568
01:20:08,640 --> 01:20:08,830
the,

2569
01:20:08,830 --> 01:20:10,860
the premier world GMO expert.

2570
01:20:11,310 --> 01:20:12,600
He points out that when,

2571
01:20:12,990 --> 01:20:13,261
you know,

2572
01:20:13,261 --> 01:20:16,410
when Monsanto was doing
feeding trials for FDA on,

2573
01:20:16,411 --> 01:20:16,831
for example,

2574
01:20:16,831 --> 01:20:17,664
potatoes,

2575
01:20:17,840 --> 01:20:18,361
a GMO,

2576
01:20:18,361 --> 01:20:23,010
potatoes they chose for the feeding trial,

2577
01:20:23,070 --> 01:20:24,420
geriatric rats.

2578
01:20:25,020 --> 01:20:25,171
Well,

2579
01:20:25,171 --> 01:20:27,570
geriatric rats are
already completely form.

2580
01:20:27,571 --> 01:20:27,691
You know,

2581
01:20:27,691 --> 01:20:31,080
you're not going to see any big
changes in those in Scotland.

2582
01:20:32,130 --> 01:20:32,760
When the,

2583
01:20:32,760 --> 01:20:33,150
uh,

2584
01:20:33,150 --> 01:20:33,721
scientists,

2585
01:20:33,721 --> 01:20:37,770
they're duplicated those
studies with juvenile rats,

2586
01:20:38,550 --> 01:20:39,980
same feeding trial,

2587
01:20:39,981 --> 01:20:40,830
same potatoes,

2588
01:20:40,831 --> 01:20:41,910
same everything,

2589
01:20:42,480 --> 01:20:45,630
all sorts of problems
develop cognitive ability,

2590
01:20:45,631 --> 01:20:46,440
brain fog.

2591
01:20:46,440 --> 01:20:47,730
They couldn't go through a maze,

2592
01:20:48,780 --> 01:20:49,980
a organ development,

2593
01:20:50,010 --> 01:20:51,270
kidney malfunction,

2594
01:20:51,650 --> 01:20:54,210
a fertility problems.

2595
01:20:54,270 --> 01:20:54,600
I mean,

2596
01:20:54,600 --> 01:20:55,380
you name it.

2597
01:20:55,380 --> 01:20:56,520
I had all these problems.

2598
01:20:56,970 --> 01:20:57,803
So,

2599
01:20:57,840 --> 01:20:58,440
you know,

2600
01:20:58,440 --> 01:20:59,040
one of the,

2601
01:20:59,040 --> 01:21:02,580
one of the problems with science
is that it's very subjective.

2602
01:21:03,480 --> 01:21:07,260
You can set up an experiment
within your paradigm.

2603
01:21:07,380 --> 01:21:07,591
You know,

2604
01:21:07,591 --> 01:21:09,090
Teddy Roosevelt used to say,

2605
01:21:09,420 --> 01:21:10,650
it's really hard to see,

2606
01:21:10,860 --> 01:21:15,140
it's really hard to get a guy to see
something when his paycheck believes a

2607
01:21:15,150 --> 01:21:18,230
depends on seeing something else
as a good way of putting it.

2608
01:21:18,460 --> 01:21:21,030
And I think that's exactly
what's happened here,

2609
01:21:21,210 --> 01:21:25,400
that you can set up experiments and,

2610
01:21:25,530 --> 01:21:27,390
and constrict the parameters,

2611
01:21:27,420 --> 01:21:29,280
whether it's length of time,

2612
01:21:29,430 --> 01:21:30,480
type of subject,

2613
01:21:30,630 --> 01:21:31,080
you know,

2614
01:21:31,080 --> 01:21:31,913
you name it,

2615
01:21:32,640 --> 01:21:35,010
but you can set up the
parameters of the experiment

2616
01:21:36,720 --> 01:21:38,040
to skew the results,

2617
01:21:38,100 --> 01:21:42,540
to not get a comprehensive eclectic
view like the geriatric read,

2618
01:21:42,570 --> 01:21:43,670
like the geriatric rats.

2619
01:21:43,671 --> 01:21:45,120
And that seems like dirty pool.

2620
01:21:45,420 --> 01:21:45,990
That's,

2621
01:21:45,990 --> 01:21:47,560
that's a bad thing that they do.

2622
01:21:47,660 --> 01:21:48,493
Yeah.

2623
01:21:49,310 --> 01:21:49,841
They do.

2624
01:21:49,841 --> 01:21:51,030
In doing this just for profit.

2625
01:21:51,630 --> 01:21:52,470
Absolutely.

2626
01:21:52,471 --> 01:21:53,071
I mean there's,

2627
01:21:53,071 --> 01:21:54,450
there's a lot of money on the line,

2628
01:21:54,570 --> 01:21:55,980
a lot of money on the line.

2629
01:21:55,980 --> 01:21:56,150
I,

2630
01:21:56,150 --> 01:21:56,983
um,

2631
01:21:57,990 --> 01:21:58,823
and

2632
01:22:00,150 --> 01:22:00,421
so,

2633
01:22:00,421 --> 01:22:00,661
you know,

2634
01:22:00,661 --> 01:22:00,800
so,

2635
01:22:00,800 --> 01:22:02,490
so where are we going to go from here?

2636
01:22:02,491 --> 01:22:04,020
How do we go from here?

2637
01:22:04,230 --> 01:22:04,711
And so,

2638
01:22:04,711 --> 01:22:04,921
you know,

2639
01:22:04,921 --> 01:22:05,401
when you ask,

2640
01:22:05,401 --> 01:22:05,491
well,

2641
01:22:05,491 --> 01:22:06,121
you know what,

2642
01:22:06,121 --> 01:22:07,650
what could you do?

2643
01:22:08,420 --> 01:22:09,180
All right,

2644
01:22:09,180 --> 01:22:10,770
we know this system is bad,

2645
01:22:11,010 --> 01:22:11,580
how do we,

2646
01:22:11,580 --> 01:22:13,860
how do we really move over here?

2647
01:22:14,310 --> 01:22:15,143
And

2648
01:22:16,500 --> 01:22:17,580
there are several answers.

2649
01:22:17,581 --> 01:22:17,821
I mean,

2650
01:22:17,821 --> 01:22:18,450
one is,

2651
01:22:18,450 --> 01:22:18,750
you know,

2652
01:22:18,750 --> 01:22:19,740
go underground,

2653
01:22:19,920 --> 01:22:20,131
you know,

2654
01:22:20,131 --> 01:22:21,810
just start buying the good stuff.

2655
01:22:22,260 --> 01:22:25,080
I'm guerrilla type marketing,

2656
01:22:25,860 --> 01:22:28,680
but I think the main one is the,

2657
01:22:29,160 --> 01:22:32,760
what we need is a food
emancipation proclamation.

2658
01:22:33,650 --> 01:22:37,620
We need a food emancipation proclamation
to free the food system from the

2659
01:22:37,621 --> 01:22:40,980
enslavement of bureaucratic orthodoxy

2660
01:22:42,600 --> 01:22:44,700
so that consenting adults,

2661
01:22:44,701 --> 01:22:49,701
and I'm choosing my words very carefully
here so that consenting adults could

2662
01:22:49,891 --> 01:22:54,000
make a voluntary choice of food choice,

2663
01:22:55,140 --> 01:22:58,500
the type that they want from
the source that they want.

2664
01:22:59,340 --> 01:23:03,990
And if we allowed however
many in our society,

2665
01:23:04,320 --> 01:23:05,140
five percent,

2666
01:23:05,140 --> 01:23:05,741
10 percent,

2667
01:23:05,741 --> 01:23:06,574
20 percent,

2668
01:23:06,820 --> 01:23:09,670
who ever didn't,

2669
01:23:10,420 --> 01:23:15,420
can whoever wanted to opt out of
government sanctioned orthodoxy and say,

2670
01:23:16,900 --> 01:23:17,733
hmm,

2671
01:23:18,430 --> 01:23:19,900
is there something better out here?

2672
01:23:20,410 --> 01:23:21,850
Can I choose something different?

2673
01:23:22,330 --> 01:23:27,330
If anybody who wanted to opt out of the
of the current industrial government

2674
01:23:28,211 --> 01:23:30,820
orthodoxy could do so,

2675
01:23:32,060 --> 01:23:34,660
no voluntary consenting adults here.

2676
01:23:35,160 --> 01:23:35,500
You know,

2677
01:23:35,500 --> 01:23:38,470
we're talking about the
right of private contract.

2678
01:23:38,471 --> 01:23:39,220
If I want to,

2679
01:23:39,220 --> 01:23:41,230
if I want to come to
your farm voluntarily,

2680
01:23:41,231 --> 01:23:42,310
no extortion here,

2681
01:23:42,340 --> 01:23:43,173
okay?

2682
01:23:43,270 --> 01:23:44,980
Voluntarily look around,

2683
01:23:44,981 --> 01:23:45,641
smell around,

2684
01:23:45,641 --> 01:23:48,520
ask around and I want
what you're producing.

2685
01:23:49,690 --> 01:23:50,710
I should be able to get it.

2686
01:23:51,430 --> 01:23:53,830
When the government gets
between my lips and my throat,

2687
01:23:53,831 --> 01:23:57,160
I call that an invasion
of privacy and yes,

2688
01:23:57,161 --> 01:24:01,240
I do also believe that we
should legalize all drugs,

2689
01:24:01,630 --> 01:24:02,463
all of them,

2690
01:24:02,800 --> 01:24:06,880
because the government that can tell you
you can't smoke dope can also tell you

2691
01:24:06,910 --> 01:24:08,860
can't drink raw milk or,

2692
01:24:09,070 --> 01:24:09,460
or,

2693
01:24:09,460 --> 01:24:09,850
or,

2694
01:24:09,850 --> 01:24:12,670
or refuse to vaccinate
your children or you know,

2695
01:24:12,700 --> 01:24:13,600
go down the line.

2696
01:24:14,290 --> 01:24:19,290
The fact is that the orthodoxy
is so convoluted now that
it's perfectly safe and

2697
01:24:23,051 --> 01:24:25,150
fine to feed your kids Coca Cola,

2698
01:24:25,151 --> 01:24:26,800
mountain dew count Chocula,

2699
01:24:27,190 --> 01:24:29,020
cheerio's and pop tarts,

2700
01:24:30,070 --> 01:24:34,000
but not homemade charcuterie.

2701
01:24:34,510 --> 01:24:35,343
Pickles,

2702
01:24:35,860 --> 01:24:38,890
raw milk and backyard butcher chickens.

2703
01:24:39,010 --> 01:24:39,790
Not Crazy.

2704
01:24:39,790 --> 01:24:41,590
It's absolutely crazy.

2705
01:24:41,710 --> 01:24:43,120
And if we would free up,

2706
01:24:43,670 --> 01:24:44,050
I mean,

2707
01:24:44,050 --> 01:24:44,740
I travel a lot.

2708
01:24:44,740 --> 01:24:47,200
I talked to thousands
and thousands of farmers.

2709
01:24:47,201 --> 01:24:50,620
I just talked to 200 farmers
up in San Jose this weekend.

2710
01:24:50,650 --> 01:24:51,483
You know,

2711
01:24:51,570 --> 01:24:53,710
and what's the limiting factor?

2712
01:24:53,800 --> 01:24:55,390
Why is local food cheap?

2713
01:24:55,540 --> 01:24:57,130
Why is our kind of food,

2714
01:24:57,150 --> 01:24:57,983
I mean cheap,

2715
01:24:58,000 --> 01:25:00,250
more expensive than it has to be.

2716
01:25:00,760 --> 01:25:02,530
Why are we perceived as elitist?

2717
01:25:02,710 --> 01:25:04,180
Why isn't it more available?

2718
01:25:04,181 --> 01:25:06,760
Why is it so hard to find integrity food?

2719
01:25:07,300 --> 01:25:08,260
This is the issue.

2720
01:25:08,560 --> 01:25:13,560
And if we would free up those of us in
the system that are ready to access our

2721
01:25:16,541 --> 01:25:21,370
neighbors with quiche and noodles
and charcuterie and you know,

2722
01:25:21,640 --> 01:25:22,211
a name,

2723
01:25:22,211 --> 01:25:24,910
your name it to free us up,

2724
01:25:25,930 --> 01:25:26,763
it would,

2725
01:25:26,890 --> 01:25:31,890
it would completely invert the
entire food system in a year.

2726
01:25:33,300 --> 01:25:36,150
The entire food system as you speak
of like when you're talking about the

2727
01:25:36,151 --> 01:25:39,960
genetically modified organisms and
you're talking about these companies that

2728
01:25:39,961 --> 01:25:41,880
provide them like Monsanto.

2729
01:25:42,120 --> 01:25:45,750
There's a backlash against that now
because of the information that's been

2730
01:25:45,751 --> 01:25:48,180
released about the
detrimental effects of them.

2731
01:25:48,181 --> 01:25:50,250
And you're seeing like in Brazil,

2732
01:25:50,251 --> 01:25:51,420
they won lawsuits,

2733
01:25:51,421 --> 01:25:55,230
a farmers one massive lawsuits
against Monsanto and these,

2734
01:25:55,280 --> 01:25:56,113
um,

2735
01:25:56,910 --> 01:26:00,180
various GMO products that they've created.

2736
01:26:00,360 --> 01:26:05,120
Say what you're talking about Iowa
and the fertility of the land in Iowa.

2737
01:26:05,690 --> 01:26:06,110
What,

2738
01:26:06,110 --> 01:26:06,980
what could,

2739
01:26:07,430 --> 01:26:09,290
what could possibly happen?

2740
01:26:09,320 --> 01:26:14,320
How could those all these farms that are
set up to just specifically grow grains

2741
01:26:14,691 --> 01:26:19,691
and a lot of them grains
that are specifically grown
just to feed livestock or

2742
01:26:19,761 --> 01:26:20,630
make alcohol,

2743
01:26:21,180 --> 01:26:22,000
that,

2744
01:26:22,000 --> 01:26:23,060
is that what it is to like?

2745
01:26:23,090 --> 01:26:23,211
Well,

2746
01:26:23,211 --> 01:26:23,371
yeah,

2747
01:26:23,371 --> 01:26:23,770
of course,

2748
01:26:23,770 --> 01:26:24,110
you know,

2749
01:26:24,110 --> 01:26:25,250
all the alcohol,

2750
01:26:25,850 --> 01:26:26,210
corn,

2751
01:26:26,210 --> 01:26:26,451
corn,

2752
01:26:26,451 --> 01:26:26,900
alcohol,

2753
01:26:26,900 --> 01:26:27,560
that's what I'm,

2754
01:26:27,560 --> 01:26:28,780
most of the farms,

2755
01:26:28,940 --> 01:26:29,850
a lot of it already.

2756
01:26:30,120 --> 01:26:34,370
But go ahead with the massive amounts
of Ronnie are invested in these systems.

2757
01:26:34,610 --> 01:26:35,720
What could they do?

2758
01:26:35,750 --> 01:26:35,930
I mean,

2759
01:26:35,930 --> 01:26:37,940
what could be done to change all that?

2760
01:26:37,970 --> 01:26:42,800
Could those farms be sort of turned
around and brought to a more of a

2761
01:26:43,150 --> 01:26:45,080
comprehensive approach to farming?

2762
01:26:45,081 --> 01:26:47,210
Like you're prescribing
what the deliveries

2763
01:26:47,250 --> 01:26:49,080
stables do when the automobile came?

2764
01:26:51,390 --> 01:26:52,560
That's what we're talking about here.

2765
01:26:53,280 --> 01:26:55,020
Think about that transition.

2766
01:26:55,170 --> 01:26:56,003
Um,

2767
01:26:56,090 --> 01:26:56,400
uh,

2768
01:26:56,400 --> 01:26:59,850
think about the horse drawn Hackney's
when the electric streetcar came.

2769
01:27:00,870 --> 01:27:01,530
I mean,

2770
01:27:01,530 --> 01:27:02,700
you're talking that,

2771
01:27:02,730 --> 01:27:04,770
that's the level of change here.

2772
01:27:05,100 --> 01:27:10,050
You're talking about
massive societal change.

2773
01:27:10,530 --> 01:27:11,820
There'll be some losers,

2774
01:27:12,600 --> 01:27:13,470
but you know what?

2775
01:27:13,980 --> 01:27:18,540
Those guys have been making fun of me
and calling me a bio terrorist and a

2776
01:27:18,541 --> 01:27:19,321
lunatic and a,

2777
01:27:19,321 --> 01:27:19,780
you know,

2778
01:27:19,780 --> 01:27:20,613
a

2779
01:27:21,700 --> 01:27:26,700
terrorist because our chickens can
commune with redwing blackbirds and Indigo

2780
01:27:27,241 --> 01:27:28,620
buntings out in the field,

2781
01:27:28,980 --> 01:27:32,730
and then those wild birds
take our diseases to the
science based environmentally

2782
01:27:32,731 --> 01:27:37,380
controlled factory chicken houses and
threatened the planet's food supply all

2783
01:27:37,381 --> 01:27:42,381
because we were so archaic and Neanderthal
that we had our chickens running

2784
01:27:44,071 --> 01:27:44,910
around in the pasture.

2785
01:27:45,150 --> 01:27:46,530
Has that really been argued?

2786
01:27:46,590 --> 01:27:47,101
Absolutely.

2787
01:27:47,101 --> 01:27:48,090
You've really had that.

2788
01:27:48,300 --> 01:27:49,170
Wow.

2789
01:27:49,460 --> 01:27:50,550
That's hilarious.

2790
01:27:50,670 --> 01:27:50,980
You,

2791
01:27:50,980 --> 01:27:51,840
barbarian,

2792
01:27:51,841 --> 01:27:53,550
you let your chickens run loose?

2793
01:27:53,580 --> 01:27:54,121
Absolutely.

2794
01:27:54,121 --> 01:27:54,571
In fact,

2795
01:27:54,571 --> 01:27:58,290
I had two federal veterinarians when the
last time we had an avian flu outbreak

2796
01:27:58,291 --> 01:27:58,451
in,

2797
01:27:58,451 --> 01:27:58,600
uh,

2798
01:27:58,600 --> 01:28:01,050
in Virginia back about 12 years ago.

2799
01:28:01,410 --> 01:28:02,070
Um,

2800
01:28:02,070 --> 01:28:02,510
and they,

2801
01:28:02,510 --> 01:28:02,851
and they,

2802
01:28:02,851 --> 01:28:03,684
by the way,

2803
01:28:03,780 --> 01:28:08,780
they exterminated landfilled 1000
tractor trailer loads of port,

2804
01:28:09,090 --> 01:28:09,350
of,

2805
01:28:09,350 --> 01:28:10,350
of a poultry,

2806
01:28:10,440 --> 01:28:15,440
1000 tractor trailer loads of poultry
within just about a five county area of

2807
01:28:15,841 --> 01:28:16,130
me.

2808
01:28:16,130 --> 01:28:16,640
Wow.

2809
01:28:16,640 --> 01:28:17,030
Alright.

2810
01:28:17,030 --> 01:28:20,300
Did they then in turn feed that
poultry back to other chickens

2811
01:28:21,050 --> 01:28:22,140
after they killed him?

2812
01:28:22,200 --> 01:28:22,501
No.

2813
01:28:22,501 --> 01:28:22,861
No,

2814
01:28:22,861 --> 01:28:24,780
that was not because that was avian flu.

2815
01:28:24,781 --> 01:28:25,141
So they,

2816
01:28:25,141 --> 01:28:27,060
they actually landfilled or incinerated,

2817
01:28:27,110 --> 01:28:27,540
wow.

2818
01:28:27,540 --> 01:28:28,373
Burned it up.

2819
01:28:28,650 --> 01:28:29,041
But see,

2820
01:28:29,041 --> 01:28:31,680
under our system you don't
have any of that stuff.

2821
01:28:32,040 --> 01:28:32,873
So I mean,

2822
01:28:32,880 --> 01:28:34,950
a thousand tractor trailer
loads is a lot of food.

2823
01:28:35,090 --> 01:28:35,580
All right.

2824
01:28:35,580 --> 01:28:36,180
Anyway,

2825
01:28:36,180 --> 01:28:40,290
I had two vets there that were part of
the extermination of federal tax force.

2826
01:28:41,550 --> 01:28:43,890
Both of them said that,

2827
01:28:44,010 --> 01:28:44,843
um,

2828
01:28:45,420 --> 01:28:46,950
that we are considered,

2829
01:28:46,980 --> 01:28:47,221
I mean,

2830
01:28:47,221 --> 01:28:48,054
they,

2831
01:28:48,120 --> 01:28:49,920
they came to visit because
they'd read about us,

2832
01:28:50,150 --> 01:28:50,520
oh we're,

2833
01:28:50,520 --> 01:28:50,971
we're here,

2834
01:28:50,971 --> 01:28:51,211
you know,

2835
01:28:51,211 --> 01:28:52,410
they came from Oklahoma,

2836
01:28:52,420 --> 01:28:53,250
whatever.

2837
01:28:53,250 --> 01:28:54,270
We'll go see this place.

2838
01:28:54,480 --> 01:28:59,460
And both of them said that we are
considered a typhoid Mary in the,

2839
01:28:59,610 --> 01:29:01,310
in the community B,

2840
01:29:01,570 --> 01:29:01,890
b,

2841
01:29:01,890 --> 01:29:02,670
because,

2842
01:29:02,670 --> 01:29:02,911
you know,

2843
01:29:02,911 --> 01:29:03,240
we don't,

2844
01:29:03,240 --> 01:29:04,200
we don't vaccinate,

2845
01:29:04,201 --> 01:29:06,000
we don't medicate and we don't,

2846
01:29:06,270 --> 01:29:07,103
you know,

2847
01:29:07,200 --> 01:29:07,920
uh,

2848
01:29:07,920 --> 01:29:11,520
we don't do all the orthodoxy that the
industry says you're supposed to do.

2849
01:29:11,550 --> 01:29:12,210
I mean,

2850
01:29:12,210 --> 01:29:13,380
that's the orthodoxy.

2851
01:29:13,780 --> 01:29:14,480
See that's the.

2852
01:29:14,480 --> 01:29:15,390
And if you don't,

2853
01:29:15,600 --> 01:29:17,160
if you don't adhere to that,

2854
01:29:17,280 --> 01:29:20,310
and of course that then that
orthodoxy drives insurance.

2855
01:29:20,550 --> 01:29:22,170
How does the farmer sells product?

2856
01:29:22,410 --> 01:29:24,240
How does he get product
liability insurance?

2857
01:29:24,570 --> 01:29:26,460
The insurance company says,

2858
01:29:27,180 --> 01:29:27,391
well,

2859
01:29:27,391 --> 01:29:30,750
we won't underwrite you unless you
use best agricultural practices.

2860
01:29:31,110 --> 01:29:33,120
Will the insurance company doesn't
know anything about agriculture,

2861
01:29:33,121 --> 01:29:36,440
where are they going to find out about
what's best agricultural practices that

2862
01:29:36,441 --> 01:29:37,170
Dang,

2863
01:29:37,170 --> 01:29:39,300
they ring up the land grant university,

2864
01:29:39,420 --> 01:29:41,760
which is the lackey of the industry,

2865
01:29:42,120 --> 01:29:42,990
and they say,

2866
01:29:42,991 --> 01:29:43,171
well,

2867
01:29:43,171 --> 01:29:45,300
you need this protocol of vaccinations,

2868
01:29:45,301 --> 01:29:47,010
this protocol of medications,

2869
01:29:47,011 --> 01:29:48,270
this protocol of chlorine,

2870
01:29:48,420 --> 01:29:49,253
this protocol,

2871
01:29:49,470 --> 01:29:50,760
and if the farm doesn't do that,

2872
01:29:50,880 --> 01:29:52,110
it's high risk.

2873
01:29:52,290 --> 01:29:53,180
It's high risk form.

2874
01:29:53,210 --> 01:29:54,000
You better not do it.

2875
01:29:54,000 --> 01:29:59,000
And so right now a lot of farmers like
us are unable to get insurance because

2876
01:30:00,751 --> 01:30:04,110
the underwriters won't
insure risky farming,

2877
01:30:04,290 --> 01:30:05,123
which

2878
01:30:06,270 --> 01:30:07,170
is which,

2879
01:30:07,200 --> 01:30:11,340
which goes against the orthodoxy of the
system because the insurance executives

2880
01:30:11,550 --> 01:30:12,660
played golf with the,

2881
01:30:12,810 --> 01:30:13,081
you know,

2882
01:30:13,081 --> 01:30:13,441
the,

2883
01:30:13,441 --> 01:30:13,890
uh,

2884
01:30:13,890 --> 01:30:17,090
the industrial ag executives
play golf with the bureaucracy,

2885
01:30:17,280 --> 01:30:17,841
the bureaucracy,

2886
01:30:17,841 --> 01:30:18,570
executives.

2887
01:30:18,570 --> 01:30:19,800
It's all a big fraternity.

2888
01:30:19,920 --> 01:30:21,540
It's not a conspiracy.

2889
01:30:21,810 --> 01:30:25,200
It's a fraternity of ideas and
they've all drunk the Koolaid.

2890
01:30:25,810 --> 01:30:30,810
Dad is madness and it's incredibly
frustrating because you're so transparent

2891
01:30:31,411 --> 01:30:35,970
about your process and the benefits of
your process when you're sitting out

2892
01:30:35,971 --> 01:30:36,391
there.

2893
01:30:36,391 --> 01:30:39,900
In one of the videos that I watched
you sitting out there with these pigs,

2894
01:30:40,560 --> 01:30:42,880
these pigs are just hanging out there.

2895
01:30:42,960 --> 01:30:45,770
They come up to you like the pig
got under your arm and your leg,

2896
01:30:45,780 --> 01:30:46,680
put your arm on him.

2897
01:30:46,681 --> 01:30:46,921
He's like,

2898
01:30:46,921 --> 01:30:47,131
Hey,

2899
01:30:47,131 --> 01:30:47,690
what's up?

2900
01:30:47,690 --> 01:30:48,060
Yeah.

2901
01:30:48,060 --> 01:30:48,480
You know when the.

2902
01:30:48,480 --> 01:30:50,040
They just rooting around and,

2903
01:30:50,400 --> 01:30:54,450
and anybody that wouldn't
see the benefits of that,

2904
01:30:54,451 --> 01:30:56,160
you have to be either.

2905
01:30:56,280 --> 01:30:59,490
You have to have a financial
vested interest in not seeing it.

2906
01:30:59,670 --> 01:30:59,791
Oh,

2907
01:30:59,791 --> 01:31:00,810
you have to be insane.

2908
01:31:00,960 --> 01:31:01,410
Yeah.

2909
01:31:01,410 --> 01:31:01,561
Yeah.

2910
01:31:01,561 --> 01:31:03,040
You have to be in say a.

2911
01:31:03,160 --> 01:31:05,480
The best compliment I
ever got was a young chef.

2912
01:31:05,550 --> 01:31:06,400
Young chef came eight,

2913
01:31:06,401 --> 01:31:07,111
wanted to see the farm.

2914
01:31:07,111 --> 01:31:09,180
You starting to buy our
stuff and really liked it.

2915
01:31:09,810 --> 01:31:10,920
He wanted to come and see the pics.

2916
01:31:10,950 --> 01:31:11,970
I took him up to the pigs.

2917
01:31:12,180 --> 01:31:13,013
He says,

2918
01:31:13,140 --> 01:31:13,500
you know,

2919
01:31:13,500 --> 01:31:13,730
I,

2920
01:31:13,730 --> 01:31:14,491
it was a young guy.

2921
01:31:14,491 --> 01:31:15,030
He said,

2922
01:31:15,030 --> 01:31:15,960
I have never.

2923
01:31:16,560 --> 01:31:17,670
I've never seen a live pig.

2924
01:31:17,700 --> 01:31:18,480
You know,

2925
01:31:18,480 --> 01:31:18,741
he,

2926
01:31:18,741 --> 01:31:19,050
he,

2927
01:31:19,050 --> 01:31:20,610
he cuts them up and
cook them all the time,

2928
01:31:20,611 --> 01:31:24,330
but he never been physically present
with a live pig and he just got really

2929
01:31:24,331 --> 01:31:24,661
quiet.

2930
01:31:24,661 --> 01:31:25,171
I just let him,

2931
01:31:25,171 --> 01:31:25,590
you know,

2932
01:31:25,590 --> 01:31:29,730
enjoy it for a little while and the pigs
were knowing on his shoe strings and

2933
01:31:29,740 --> 01:31:31,050
just there and he finally said,

2934
01:31:31,051 --> 01:31:31,884
you know,

2935
01:31:32,190 --> 01:31:34,410
I don't know anything about raising pigs,

2936
01:31:35,670 --> 01:31:37,230
but I think if I was a pig,

2937
01:31:37,680 --> 01:31:39,210
this is the way I'd want to live

2938
01:31:41,730 --> 01:31:42,100
into.

2939
01:31:42,100 --> 01:31:43,320
It resonates in our soul.

2940
01:31:43,321 --> 01:31:43,531
I mean,

2941
01:31:43,531 --> 01:31:44,364
if you have,

2942
01:31:44,370 --> 01:31:46,830
if you have a conscience at all,

2943
01:31:47,610 --> 01:31:48,900
it resonates in your conscience.

2944
01:31:48,901 --> 01:31:48,991
Yeah.

2945
01:31:48,991 --> 01:31:50,790
Here's your pigs up here on the screen.

2946
01:31:50,791 --> 01:31:51,420
I mean,

2947
01:31:51,420 --> 01:31:52,830
these pigs are just chilling.

2948
01:31:52,920 --> 01:31:53,250
Yeah,

2949
01:31:53,250 --> 01:31:54,360
they're having a great time.

2950
01:31:54,361 --> 01:31:56,730
They're not stuck in some disgusting Penn,

2951
01:31:56,910 --> 01:31:58,170
whether they're lumped in.

2952
01:31:58,171 --> 01:31:58,351
I mean,

2953
01:31:58,351 --> 01:31:59,980
there was a story recently of

2954
01:31:59,980 --> 01:32:02,050
a farmer who they believe fell.

2955
01:32:02,260 --> 01:32:03,460
They believe he may
have had a heart attack,

2956
01:32:03,461 --> 01:32:08,461
is that older gentleman fell into a pick
up a pen and was killed by the pigs,

2957
01:32:10,450 --> 01:32:12,580
but he mean that's in everybody's like,

2958
01:32:12,581 --> 01:32:13,540
all pigs are vicious.

2959
01:32:14,010 --> 01:32:16,090
It's the conditions that are vicious.

2960
01:32:16,330 --> 01:32:18,100
These pigs aren't going to kill anybody.

2961
01:32:18,310 --> 01:32:20,830
These pigs come right up
to the in nozzle with you.

2962
01:32:20,831 --> 01:32:21,071
Man.

2963
01:32:21,071 --> 01:32:21,840
I've seen it.

2964
01:32:21,840 --> 01:32:22,140
They,

2965
01:32:22,140 --> 01:32:23,910
they will kill you if you quit moving.

2966
01:32:23,970 --> 01:32:24,870
They're omnivores.

2967
01:32:24,871 --> 01:32:25,310
You know,

2968
01:32:25,310 --> 01:32:25,560
yeah.

2969
01:32:25,560 --> 01:32:25,980
If you,

2970
01:32:25,980 --> 01:32:26,813
if you're dead,

2971
01:32:26,990 --> 01:32:27,840
if you're dead,

2972
01:32:28,590 --> 01:32:30,600
tell kindergarteners that
want to go in and pet them.

2973
01:32:30,601 --> 01:32:31,170
I said,

2974
01:32:31,170 --> 01:32:31,591
absolutely.

2975
01:32:31,591 --> 01:32:33,030
You're welcome to go in and pet them.

2976
01:32:33,240 --> 01:32:34,200
Just keep wiggling.

2977
01:32:35,010 --> 01:32:36,210
Just keep wiggling.

2978
01:32:37,440 --> 01:32:38,280
That's hilarious.

2979
01:32:38,360 --> 01:32:41,670
Your toes first and your fingers that
in an hour there'll be to your spleen,

2980
01:32:41,671 --> 01:32:42,001
you know,

2981
01:32:42,001 --> 01:32:42,820
so uh,

2982
01:32:42,820 --> 01:32:43,540
wow.

2983
01:32:43,540 --> 01:32:44,111
Keep moving.

2984
01:32:44,111 --> 01:32:47,500
They are omnivores and they are survivors.

2985
01:32:47,530 --> 01:32:48,040
They are,

2986
01:32:48,040 --> 01:32:48,873
they're very cool.

2987
01:32:48,880 --> 01:32:53,260
That's one of the interesting things about
pigs is this huge problem with feral,

2988
01:32:53,290 --> 01:32:57,160
what we call feral hogs because they're
not a native species to North America

2989
01:32:57,520 --> 01:33:01,290
and they don't really have any
natural predators other than,

2990
01:33:01,291 --> 01:33:01,600
you know,

2991
01:33:01,600 --> 01:33:04,900
coyotes which have sort of taken them
on and mountain lions and all the other

2992
01:33:04,960 --> 01:33:06,340
animals that we have in North America.

2993
01:33:06,341 --> 01:33:11,341
But the number one invasive
species problem we have as
far as like big animals,

2994
01:33:11,771 --> 01:33:12,640
his pigs.

2995
01:33:12,800 --> 01:33:13,633
There again,

2996
01:33:13,670 --> 01:33:14,241
there again,

2997
01:33:14,241 --> 01:33:14,980
the problem,

2998
01:33:14,980 --> 01:33:16,220
it's a political problem.

2999
01:33:16,221 --> 01:33:16,880
It's not a,

3000
01:33:16,880 --> 01:33:18,500
it's not an ecological problem.

3001
01:33:18,660 --> 01:33:18,960
You know,

3002
01:33:18,960 --> 01:33:20,780
in Europe they have feral pigs too,

3003
01:33:20,930 --> 01:33:21,770
but it's not a problem.

3004
01:33:21,771 --> 01:33:22,604
You know why?

3005
01:33:22,730 --> 01:33:25,790
Because you can go out and shoot
a pig and sell it to a restaurant,

3006
01:33:26,330 --> 01:33:27,620
you can sell it to a neighbor.

3007
01:33:27,890 --> 01:33:28,880
They allow,

3008
01:33:29,310 --> 01:33:29,660
you know,

3009
01:33:29,660 --> 01:33:31,190
wild shot animals,

3010
01:33:31,250 --> 01:33:34,970
deer and pigs to go into commerce.

3011
01:33:35,720 --> 01:33:37,130
Sorry about that though,

3012
01:33:37,131 --> 01:33:41,270
is from a sportsman's point of view that
you're going to have people out there

3013
01:33:41,271 --> 01:33:46,271
sniping and poaching deer and all the
really precious wild animals and selling

3014
01:33:48,531 --> 01:33:50,810
them to restaurants and there
won't be any there for hunter.

3015
01:33:53,110 --> 01:33:57,160
The thing is nature has a way of
balancing it out and when there's an

3016
01:33:57,161 --> 01:33:58,360
overpopulation,

3017
01:33:58,420 --> 01:34:00,250
they're easy to get and then once they.

3018
01:34:00,280 --> 01:34:01,570
Once they get harder to get.

3019
01:34:02,800 --> 01:34:02,910
Yeah.

3020
01:34:02,910 --> 01:34:03,491
Then people,

3021
01:34:03,491 --> 01:34:06,580
then people get discouraged from
hunting because they're too hard to get.

3022
01:34:06,820 --> 01:34:09,170
I would be more in
support of that for pigs.

3023
01:34:09,171 --> 01:34:12,010
Then the other animals simply
because pigs breed all year round,

3024
01:34:12,011 --> 01:34:14,530
they'll get off several
litters a year of many,

3025
01:34:14,810 --> 01:34:17,840
but whereas a deer will have one fond,

3026
01:34:18,040 --> 01:34:18,450
you know,

3027
01:34:18,450 --> 01:34:21,310
and they'll have a phone or two
and they'll have them once a year.

3028
01:34:21,580 --> 01:34:23,500
Well maybe you could
control it with licenses.

3029
01:34:23,501 --> 01:34:24,430
Just give people,

3030
01:34:24,610 --> 01:34:24,851
you know,

3031
01:34:24,851 --> 01:34:25,240
you can.

3032
01:34:25,240 --> 01:34:26,660
You can harvest so many a deer,

3033
01:34:26,710 --> 01:34:27,461
so many a year,

3034
01:34:27,461 --> 01:34:27,881
whatever.

3035
01:34:27,881 --> 01:34:28,460
I mean,

3036
01:34:28,460 --> 01:34:30,010
there's a lot of ways to skin the cat.

3037
01:34:30,100 --> 01:34:32,230
The bottom line I'm getting too though,

3038
01:34:32,231 --> 01:34:34,090
is that when you,

3039
01:34:34,120 --> 01:34:37,210
when you prohibit a food
source from entering commerce,

3040
01:34:38,740 --> 01:34:39,190
you,

3041
01:34:39,190 --> 01:34:40,023
you,

3042
01:34:40,570 --> 01:34:45,570
you automatically have the
government manipulating a,

3043
01:34:45,980 --> 01:34:46,710
a,

3044
01:34:46,710 --> 01:34:47,500
a,

3045
01:34:47,500 --> 01:34:49,720
a supply and demand situation.

3046
01:34:51,400 --> 01:34:52,510
That's the reality.

3047
01:34:53,080 --> 01:34:54,130
And so,

3048
01:34:54,370 --> 01:34:54,760
uh,

3049
01:34:54,760 --> 01:34:55,331
so you know,

3050
01:34:55,331 --> 01:34:55,520
the,

3051
01:34:55,520 --> 01:34:56,380
the people that are,

3052
01:34:56,410 --> 01:34:57,620
that are concerned about,

3053
01:34:57,740 --> 01:34:59,210
and you go down some areas,

3054
01:34:59,211 --> 01:34:59,340
I'm,

3055
01:34:59,340 --> 01:34:59,550
yeah,

3056
01:34:59,550 --> 01:35:01,370
the wild pig problem is a real,

3057
01:35:01,700 --> 01:35:05,960
it's a real land abuse problem where
they're having him in suburban San Jose,

3058
01:35:06,050 --> 01:35:09,800
San Jose as people are
having their lawns chewed up.

3059
01:35:09,801 --> 01:35:12,920
There was a big news story about it the
other day where they showed these pigs

3060
01:35:12,921 --> 01:35:16,610
running across people's lawns
and this normal suburban street,

3061
01:35:16,611 --> 01:35:17,780
they're chewing up their lawn.

3062
01:35:17,830 --> 01:35:19,650
They're resourceful and they're smart,

3063
01:35:19,651 --> 01:35:19,770
but,

3064
01:35:19,770 --> 01:35:19,911
you know,

3065
01:35:19,911 --> 01:35:20,960
pitching the smartest,

3066
01:35:21,500 --> 01:35:24,080
supposedly one of the
smartest animals there is.

3067
01:35:24,160 --> 01:35:24,350
And,

3068
01:35:24,350 --> 01:35:24,951
and they are,

3069
01:35:24,951 --> 01:35:25,221
they're,

3070
01:35:25,221 --> 01:35:25,791
they're really,

3071
01:35:25,791 --> 01:35:26,624
uh,

3072
01:35:26,630 --> 01:35:27,463
they're really smart.

3073
01:35:27,720 --> 01:35:28,061
So,

3074
01:35:28,061 --> 01:35:28,910
so if we would,

3075
01:35:29,030 --> 01:35:33,520
if we would allow people
to actually practice,

3076
01:35:33,590 --> 01:35:38,060
I'm consenting adult voluntary
commerce on some of these things.

3077
01:35:38,690 --> 01:35:39,200
It would,

3078
01:35:39,200 --> 01:35:42,770
it would then incentivize innovation,

3079
01:35:43,580 --> 01:35:48,580
entrepreneurship and the antidote to all
of the depressing things we've talked

3080
01:35:50,391 --> 01:35:52,160
about [inaudible] and,

3081
01:35:52,370 --> 01:35:53,150
and um,

3082
01:35:53,150 --> 01:35:57,680
and our side then would rise and
the other side would have to adapt.

3083
01:35:57,681 --> 01:35:59,240
They'd either have to down,

3084
01:35:59,290 --> 01:35:59,790
I mean,

3085
01:35:59,790 --> 01:36:00,010
there,

3086
01:36:00,010 --> 01:36:00,800
there's talk,

3087
01:36:00,800 --> 01:36:01,371
for example,

3088
01:36:01,371 --> 01:36:05,840
right now among the poultry industry of
trying to go antibiotic free in 10 years

3089
01:36:06,650 --> 01:36:07,221
and uh,

3090
01:36:07,221 --> 01:36:07,881
in order to do it,

3091
01:36:07,881 --> 01:36:12,410
they're going to have to greatly
drop the bird size in their houses.

3092
01:36:12,620 --> 01:36:16,910
And I know that there's a lot of
research going into building these living

3093
01:36:16,911 --> 01:36:20,690
compost bedding situations
in these houses.

3094
01:36:21,350 --> 01:36:22,700
Even in the poultry industry.

3095
01:36:22,730 --> 01:36:23,160
Yes.

3096
01:36:23,160 --> 01:36:23,430
In,

3097
01:36:23,430 --> 01:36:24,620
in the poultry industry.

3098
01:36:24,621 --> 01:36:25,100
Yeah.

3099
01:36:25,100 --> 01:36:25,491
I mean,

3100
01:36:25,491 --> 01:36:25,671
uh,

3101
01:36:25,671 --> 01:36:26,360
you know,

3102
01:36:26,360 --> 01:36:27,193
Denmark,

3103
01:36:28,490 --> 01:36:29,930
Denmark made the change.

3104
01:36:29,990 --> 01:36:30,980
They outlawed,

3105
01:36:31,000 --> 01:36:34,730
I'm a factory pork houses years ago.

3106
01:36:35,000 --> 01:36:35,870
They'd been fine.

3107
01:36:36,020 --> 01:36:37,550
They've gone too deep bedded,

3108
01:36:37,880 --> 01:36:38,211
you know,

3109
01:36:38,211 --> 01:36:41,530
houses completely
different situation and um,

3110
01:36:41,620 --> 01:36:44,270
and it makes it a completely
different living environment.

3111
01:36:44,271 --> 01:36:44,860
So,

3112
01:36:44,860 --> 01:36:45,170
you know,

3113
01:36:45,170 --> 01:36:45,711
you can,

3114
01:36:45,711 --> 01:36:46,544
um,

3115
01:36:46,640 --> 01:36:48,470
you can make those changes.

3116
01:36:48,680 --> 01:36:49,101
They're not,

3117
01:36:49,101 --> 01:36:50,450
they're not insurmountable.

3118
01:36:50,451 --> 01:36:53,630
And those changes though
still are not where you're at.

3119
01:36:53,820 --> 01:36:54,560
You're in,

3120
01:36:54,560 --> 01:36:59,560
you've got these animals moving around
and his giant farm and you move your

3121
01:37:00,981 --> 01:37:02,870
electric fences from place to place.

3122
01:37:03,070 --> 01:37:03,600
What?

3123
01:37:03,600 --> 01:37:04,433
What's the,

3124
01:37:04,640 --> 01:37:07,580
the method like how do you
get the animals to move?

3125
01:37:07,581 --> 01:37:08,330
Like when you,

3126
01:37:08,330 --> 01:37:11,570
like you have them in one
area for like a day day.

3127
01:37:11,571 --> 01:37:12,140
Yeah.

3128
01:37:12,140 --> 01:37:13,440
How big is the area that you.

3129
01:37:14,000 --> 01:37:14,270
Lemon.

3130
01:37:14,270 --> 01:37:15,140
Let's take cows.

3131
01:37:15,141 --> 01:37:15,450
I mean,

3132
01:37:15,450 --> 01:37:16,231
we've gone as,

3133
01:37:16,231 --> 01:37:20,360
as tight as a 400 head
on two acres for a day.

3134
01:37:20,390 --> 01:37:24,860
I mean that's pretty tight at and an
acre is a football field just for people

3135
01:37:24,861 --> 01:37:26,240
trying to visualize what's an acre.

3136
01:37:26,640 --> 01:37:27,830
It's roughly a football field.

3137
01:37:27,980 --> 01:37:28,491
So,

3138
01:37:28,491 --> 01:37:28,730
you know,

3139
01:37:28,730 --> 01:37:30,680
imagine 400 cows on two acres.

3140
01:37:31,110 --> 01:37:31,811
That's pretty dense.

3141
01:37:31,811 --> 01:37:32,050
All.

3142
01:37:32,050 --> 01:37:32,540
Yeah.

3143
01:37:32,540 --> 01:37:33,110
Um,

3144
01:37:33,110 --> 01:37:36,350
but the beauty is that when you
move them all the time like this,

3145
01:37:36,470 --> 01:37:37,730
they get very docile.

3146
01:37:37,880 --> 01:37:38,370
I mean,

3147
01:37:38,370 --> 01:37:38,590
you know,

3148
01:37:38,590 --> 01:37:39,423
their route,

3149
01:37:39,680 --> 01:37:43,580
their routine and you incentivize it
because every day at 4:00 when you go out

3150
01:37:43,581 --> 01:37:44,414
and call them,

3151
01:37:44,570 --> 01:37:48,260
they're going to a new
salad bar everyday at 4:00,

3152
01:37:48,470 --> 01:37:51,400
a certain call meant there's
a bowl of ice cream for you.

3153
01:37:51,540 --> 01:37:51,830
You know,

3154
01:37:51,830 --> 01:37:54,260
you'd get pretty used
to that call as well.

3155
01:37:54,330 --> 01:37:54,801
Is that what you do?

3156
01:37:54,801 --> 01:37:55,600
You call them?

3157
01:37:55,600 --> 01:37:56,191
We call them.

3158
01:37:56,191 --> 01:37:56,851
We don't hurt them,

3159
01:37:56,851 --> 01:37:57,381
we call it.

3160
01:37:57,381 --> 01:37:58,410
What do you call?

3161
01:37:58,411 --> 01:37:59,490
Do you have a noisy make?

3162
01:38:02,120 --> 01:38:06,140
And so they hear that and they know
it's a little dinner Bell Dinner Bell.

3163
01:38:06,500 --> 01:38:06,750
Yeah.

3164
01:38:06,750 --> 01:38:07,583
And they just,

3165
01:38:07,630 --> 01:38:08,790
they just fall right on.

3166
01:38:09,240 --> 01:38:09,571
Wow.

3167
01:38:09,571 --> 01:38:10,000
So,

3168
01:38:10,000 --> 01:38:10,290
uh,

3169
01:38:10,290 --> 01:38:11,850
then you set up this new,

3170
01:38:12,300 --> 01:38:13,500
you put the stakes down,

3171
01:38:13,890 --> 01:38:15,120
set up this new area,

3172
01:38:15,210 --> 01:38:15,750
the fences,

3173
01:38:15,750 --> 01:38:16,830
totally portable.

3174
01:38:16,950 --> 01:38:18,090
So you're essentially,

3175
01:38:18,091 --> 01:38:18,840
I mean,

3176
01:38:18,840 --> 01:38:22,720
envision a field like a
ladder and the permanent fit,

3177
01:38:22,870 --> 01:38:23,200
the,

3178
01:38:23,200 --> 01:38:25,680
the edges of the field are the,

3179
01:38:25,710 --> 01:38:26,191
are the,

3180
01:38:26,191 --> 01:38:26,940
um,

3181
01:38:26,940 --> 01:38:31,290
the stringers of the ladder and
the portable fences are the rungs.

3182
01:38:31,980 --> 01:38:36,870
So the permanent are there all the
time and we simply move the rungs,

3183
01:38:37,120 --> 01:38:37,530
you know,

3184
01:38:37,530 --> 01:38:42,030
contract or expand the rungs
based on how much grasser is,

3185
01:38:42,031 --> 01:38:43,440
how many there are in the herd,

3186
01:38:43,470 --> 01:38:44,370
get that sort of thing.

3187
01:38:44,670 --> 01:38:45,031
So it's,

3188
01:38:45,031 --> 01:38:46,470
it's a very artistic,

3189
01:38:46,500 --> 01:38:46,741
you know,

3190
01:38:46,741 --> 01:38:47,610
there's a science,

3191
01:38:47,820 --> 01:38:50,550
but there's also an art to it as we,

3192
01:38:50,880 --> 01:38:53,730
as we essentially give
them one plateful of day.

3193
01:38:54,270 --> 01:38:57,090
And you alternate animals in these areas.

3194
01:38:57,300 --> 01:38:57,630
Yeah,

3195
01:38:57,630 --> 01:38:59,040
so the cows go through first,

3196
01:38:59,070 --> 01:39:01,080
then the egg mobiles come in after them,

3197
01:39:01,110 --> 01:39:04,200
so after the cows are there and then
you push the chicken house in there.

3198
01:39:04,380 --> 01:39:05,830
He fence that in as well.

3199
01:39:05,880 --> 01:39:06,540
That's not fit.

3200
01:39:06,540 --> 01:39:08,460
Those chickens can run
anywhere they want to.

3201
01:39:08,910 --> 01:39:09,361
They just,

3202
01:39:09,361 --> 01:39:12,440
they just hang around the egg mobile
because that's where feed and water and

3203
01:39:12,510 --> 01:39:13,230
nest boxes.

3204
01:39:13,230 --> 01:39:15,180
So you don't have to fence them
and don't have to fence them.

3205
01:39:15,181 --> 01:39:15,441
They,

3206
01:39:15,441 --> 01:39:16,020
they go out,

3207
01:39:16,020 --> 01:39:16,261
you know,

3208
01:39:16,261 --> 01:39:20,970
up to 200 yards and scavenge and scratch
out cow patties and when it starts

3209
01:39:20,971 --> 01:39:23,580
getting dark they come back and
it will start coming back in.

3210
01:39:23,660 --> 01:39:24,930
So we have it in our yard.

3211
01:39:24,931 --> 01:39:25,241
We,

3212
01:39:25,241 --> 01:39:25,560
we have,

3213
01:39:25,560 --> 01:39:26,550
we leave the door open.

3214
01:39:26,551 --> 01:39:27,260
Exactly.

3215
01:39:27,260 --> 01:39:27,901
And then at the end,

3216
01:39:27,901 --> 01:39:28,890
at night we shut the door.

3217
01:39:29,280 --> 01:39:30,180
They know that.

3218
01:39:30,370 --> 01:39:30,870
I mean,

3219
01:39:30,870 --> 01:39:31,480
you know,

3220
01:39:31,480 --> 01:39:34,640
chickens or your chicken scared,

3221
01:39:34,650 --> 01:39:34,830
right?

3222
01:39:34,830 --> 01:39:38,760
I mean we use the word
slang and so they're in,

3223
01:39:38,940 --> 01:39:41,910
their instinct is to get
somewhere secure for the night.

3224
01:39:41,940 --> 01:39:44,600
They don't want to just sit
out on the ground night.

3225
01:39:44,610 --> 01:39:45,031
So there.

3226
01:39:45,031 --> 01:39:45,630
So the,

3227
01:39:45,630 --> 01:39:46,340
your,

3228
01:39:46,340 --> 01:39:48,240
your coop or the egg immobile.

3229
01:39:48,430 --> 01:39:49,500
That's a secure place.

3230
01:39:49,501 --> 01:39:51,450
And they naturally are drawn to that,

3231
01:39:51,810 --> 01:39:52,051
uh,

3232
01:39:52,051 --> 01:39:52,321
as,

3233
01:39:52,321 --> 01:39:54,360
as the dark starts to go down.

3234
01:39:54,810 --> 01:39:55,890
So for them,

3235
01:39:55,891 --> 01:39:56,910
you don't have to worry about that.

3236
01:39:56,911 --> 01:39:58,920
You just move this giant
structure that you've created,

3237
01:39:58,921 --> 01:39:59,970
which is very innovative.

3238
01:39:59,971 --> 01:40:00,840
Is this your design?

3239
01:40:00,841 --> 01:40:01,510
The structure?

3240
01:40:01,510 --> 01:40:01,790
Yeah.

3241
01:40:01,790 --> 01:40:02,160
Yeah.

3242
01:40:02,160 --> 01:40:06,060
See if you can pull up the egg immobile
because it's pretty interesting to see

3243
01:40:06,061 --> 01:40:07,650
if he could find the video of it.

3244
01:40:07,651 --> 01:40:08,940
It was in one of those,

3245
01:40:08,950 --> 01:40:09,783
uh,

3246
01:40:09,950 --> 01:40:12,000
w polyface,

3247
01:40:12,030 --> 01:40:12,571
that's what you call it.

3248
01:40:12,571 --> 01:40:17,571
Polyface farm is one of
those videos your design,

3249
01:40:17,900 --> 01:40:20,750
you just figured out how to
stack them in there and this way.

3250
01:40:21,000 --> 01:40:21,241
Well,

3251
01:40:21,241 --> 01:40:22,830
essentially it's essentially,

3252
01:40:22,831 --> 01:40:23,640
it's a,

3253
01:40:23,640 --> 01:40:25,950
it's a chicken house on
wheels is what it is.

3254
01:40:26,520 --> 01:40:27,353
And uh,

3255
01:40:27,510 --> 01:40:28,021
so you know,

3256
01:40:28,021 --> 01:40:28,380
where you,

3257
01:40:28,380 --> 01:40:30,900
where you would normally make
a chicken house for example.

3258
01:40:30,901 --> 01:40:31,021
Yeah.

3259
01:40:31,021 --> 01:40:31,854
There you go.

3260
01:40:32,100 --> 01:40:33,660
Where you normally make a chicken house,

3261
01:40:33,720 --> 01:40:34,920
a stationary.

3262
01:40:35,250 --> 01:40:36,780
This is simply modeled on wheels,

3263
01:40:36,781 --> 01:40:37,614
on an axle,

3264
01:40:37,770 --> 01:40:38,760
all like a trailer,

3265
01:40:39,030 --> 01:40:44,030
and you just hooked up to
it with a tractor and the
chickens are all inside and

3266
01:40:44,311 --> 01:40:48,600
you can move it up the public road or to
the far side of the field or whatever.

3267
01:40:48,930 --> 01:40:50,100
And there's the guard dog,

3268
01:40:50,880 --> 01:40:52,320
the guard dogs with them as well,

3269
01:40:52,350 --> 01:40:53,680
and the guard dog keeps coyotes,

3270
01:40:53,980 --> 01:40:58,390
coyotes and hawks and things
that like drumsticks for dinner.

3271
01:40:58,600 --> 01:40:59,500
He keeps those away.

3272
01:40:59,540 --> 01:41:00,550
We lost the chicken.

3273
01:41:00,640 --> 01:41:01,750
We don't know what happened.

3274
01:41:01,751 --> 01:41:03,430
I'm pretty sure it was a Hark.

3275
01:41:04,060 --> 01:41:05,350
Something just scoop one up.

3276
01:41:05,730 --> 01:41:06,563
Just vish.

3277
01:41:06,630 --> 01:41:08,020
Just vanished.

3278
01:41:08,050 --> 01:41:08,381
No.

3279
01:41:08,381 --> 01:41:08,621
Yeah,

3280
01:41:08,621 --> 01:41:09,550
there's no nothing.

3281
01:41:09,640 --> 01:41:10,091
Oh yeah,

3282
01:41:10,091 --> 01:41:10,390
they,

3283
01:41:10,390 --> 01:41:10,721
they,

3284
01:41:10,721 --> 01:41:11,050
uh,

3285
01:41:11,050 --> 01:41:11,531
they do.

3286
01:41:11,531 --> 01:41:12,850
That's why you got a lot of chickens,

3287
01:41:12,851 --> 01:41:13,180
man.

3288
01:41:13,180 --> 01:41:13,840
Oh yeah.

3289
01:41:13,840 --> 01:41:14,081
Yeah.

3290
01:41:14,081 --> 01:41:14,261
That's,

3291
01:41:14,261 --> 01:41:14,610
that's,

3292
01:41:14,610 --> 01:41:15,431
that's a lot of chickens.

3293
01:41:15,431 --> 01:41:16,630
That's a thousand chickens.

3294
01:41:16,660 --> 01:41:16,871
Now.

3295
01:41:16,871 --> 01:41:18,910
Those egg ligand laying
chickens are those.

3296
01:41:19,030 --> 01:41:21,820
Those are egg layers and you have
different chickens that are egg laying

3297
01:41:21,821 --> 01:41:23,810
chickens in different chickens
that are meat chicken.

3298
01:41:23,820 --> 01:41:24,650
That's right.

3299
01:41:24,650 --> 01:41:25,760
Dairy and beef.

3300
01:41:25,950 --> 01:41:26,900
A dairy,

3301
01:41:27,230 --> 01:41:27,591
dairy,

3302
01:41:27,591 --> 01:41:28,424
cows,

3303
01:41:29,080 --> 01:41:30,290
a grow.

3304
01:41:30,830 --> 01:41:31,880
Make a lot of milk.

3305
01:41:32,030 --> 01:41:34,430
Beef cows grow bulkier.

3306
01:41:34,580 --> 01:41:36,920
Same Way with a chickens.

3307
01:41:38,090 --> 01:41:38,810
Layers.

3308
01:41:38,810 --> 01:41:39,700
Layers have a.

3309
01:41:40,110 --> 01:41:42,140
they're genetically selected.

3310
01:41:42,141 --> 01:41:43,070
Those breeds,

3311
01:41:43,430 --> 01:41:44,263
um,

3312
01:41:44,600 --> 01:41:47,450
they lay eggs and they
have a physique more like,

3313
01:41:47,451 --> 01:41:48,140
um,

3314
01:41:48,140 --> 01:41:51,200
Koby Bryant and the meat chickens have,

3315
01:41:51,250 --> 01:41:51,830
have a seat,

3316
01:41:51,830 --> 01:41:52,700
have a physique.

3317
01:41:53,000 --> 01:41:53,970
I'm more like,

3318
01:41:54,040 --> 01:41:55,530
got Emmitt Smith.

3319
01:41:55,690 --> 01:41:56,523
Okay,

3320
01:41:56,760 --> 01:41:57,120
great.

3321
01:41:57,120 --> 01:41:58,020
If you're going to eat it,

3322
01:41:58,021 --> 01:41:59,100
you want to Emmett Smith,

3323
01:41:59,400 --> 01:42:00,360
if you want to lay an egg,

3324
01:42:00,361 --> 01:42:01,260
you want to coby Brian.

3325
01:42:01,500 --> 01:42:02,333
Gotcha.

3326
01:42:02,420 --> 01:42:03,253
Coby Brian

3327
01:42:05,690 --> 01:42:07,300
called coby Brian Agler.

3328
01:42:07,770 --> 01:42:08,603
Um,

3329
01:42:08,900 --> 01:42:11,200
so it's,

3330
01:42:11,470 --> 01:42:11,700
so,

3331
01:42:11,700 --> 01:42:13,880
it's essentially just the
breed of chicken self.

3332
01:42:14,110 --> 01:42:14,470
Yeah.

3333
01:42:14,470 --> 01:42:14,651
Yeah,

3334
01:42:14,651 --> 01:42:15,310
that's right.

3335
01:42:15,310 --> 01:42:15,701
That's right.

3336
01:42:15,701 --> 01:42:16,534
I mean all these,

3337
01:42:16,650 --> 01:42:18,340
I mean a hogs,

3338
01:42:19,000 --> 01:42:19,833
sheep,

3339
01:42:19,930 --> 01:42:21,440
sheep are known for their,

3340
01:42:21,470 --> 01:42:22,780
especially for their wool,

3341
01:42:23,050 --> 01:42:23,201
you know,

3342
01:42:23,201 --> 01:42:23,511
like the,

3343
01:42:23,511 --> 01:42:24,520
like the Merinos,

3344
01:42:24,521 --> 01:42:24,701
you know,

3345
01:42:24,701 --> 01:42:25,690
they're known for their wool.

3346
01:42:25,900 --> 01:42:27,490
Others are known more for their meat,

3347
01:42:27,780 --> 01:42:28,750
a pigs.

3348
01:42:28,980 --> 01:42:31,510
Some pigs are known for their fat.

3349
01:42:31,600 --> 01:42:33,100
They were called Lard hogs,

3350
01:42:33,300 --> 01:42:33,880
uh,

3351
01:42:33,880 --> 01:42:35,530
back in the day we ate lard,

3352
01:42:35,531 --> 01:42:35,921
you know,

3353
01:42:35,921 --> 01:42:36,640
and,

3354
01:42:36,640 --> 01:42:38,380
and so they would get real fat,

3355
01:42:38,620 --> 01:42:38,960
uh,

3356
01:42:38,960 --> 01:42:41,350
other picture known for
the length of their loin,

3357
01:42:41,380 --> 01:42:43,270
others for their maternal instincts,

3358
01:42:43,300 --> 01:42:43,600
you know,

3359
01:42:43,600 --> 01:42:43,990
big,

3360
01:42:43,990 --> 01:42:45,430
big litters.

3361
01:42:45,670 --> 01:42:46,330
So yeah,

3362
01:42:46,330 --> 01:42:49,450
all of these breeds have
different characteristics.

3363
01:42:49,451 --> 01:42:51,700
Do you only have hands or do
you have roosters as well?

3364
01:42:52,090 --> 01:42:53,350
We have roosters as well.

3365
01:42:53,620 --> 01:42:54,730
The eggs are not all,

3366
01:42:55,000 --> 01:42:57,340
we don't have enough roosters
to fertilize all of them,

3367
01:42:57,790 --> 01:42:59,770
but we do have enough roosters so that,

3368
01:42:59,820 --> 01:43:00,030
you know,

3369
01:43:00,030 --> 01:43:02,530
we get kids can watch them cro and we can,

3370
01:43:03,040 --> 01:43:03,873
um,

3371
01:43:05,080 --> 01:43:06,880
I've had a lot of people say that,

3372
01:43:07,210 --> 01:43:07,930
uh,

3373
01:43:07,930 --> 01:43:09,010
that are um,

3374
01:43:09,500 --> 01:43:10,333
uh,

3375
01:43:10,390 --> 01:43:12,330
transcendentalists or you know,

3376
01:43:12,331 --> 01:43:13,000
that,

3377
01:43:13,000 --> 01:43:13,301
that,

3378
01:43:13,301 --> 01:43:13,750
um,

3379
01:43:13,750 --> 01:43:14,020
if,

3380
01:43:14,020 --> 01:43:14,530
if that,

3381
01:43:14,530 --> 01:43:16,750
if we actually come back
as a different being,

3382
01:43:16,751 --> 01:43:19,300
they really want to come back
as a rooster at polyphase.

3383
01:43:19,660 --> 01:43:20,340
Why?

3384
01:43:20,340 --> 01:43:23,870
Because they got about
200 hens per rooster.

3385
01:43:25,250 --> 01:43:26,740
It seems like you get out run.

3386
01:43:27,210 --> 01:43:28,280
It would just start running.

3387
01:43:28,400 --> 01:43:29,360
They would tell you what to do.

3388
01:43:29,940 --> 01:43:30,340
Yeah.

3389
01:43:30,340 --> 01:43:31,760
They can get hit and pecked.

3390
01:43:31,790 --> 01:43:32,031
D.

3391
01:43:32,031 --> 01:43:32,361
Yeah.

3392
01:43:32,361 --> 01:43:32,850
Hand.

3393
01:43:32,850 --> 01:43:34,190
That's the other term.

3394
01:43:34,820 --> 01:43:36,440
Chickens being scared and Henpeck.

3395
01:43:36,590 --> 01:43:39,470
Those are both real and
henpecks do pac man.

3396
01:43:39,530 --> 01:43:40,041
Oh yeah.

3397
01:43:40,041 --> 01:43:42,050
They do wild pigs in San Jose

3398
01:43:42,780 --> 01:43:43,613
and they.

3399
01:43:44,010 --> 01:43:44,521
Oh Wow,

3400
01:43:44,521 --> 01:43:45,354
look at that.

3401
01:43:45,810 --> 01:43:46,140
Yeah,

3402
01:43:46,140 --> 01:43:46,590
he's getting,

3403
01:43:46,590 --> 01:43:47,580
he's getting food,

3404
01:43:47,581 --> 01:43:48,414
right?

3405
01:43:48,490 --> 01:43:50,240
I mean they have a real problem now.

3406
01:43:50,400 --> 01:43:52,100
It's just starting to
make its way up there.

3407
01:43:52,250 --> 01:43:55,460
A lot of people don't associate
California with wild pigs.

3408
01:43:55,840 --> 01:43:56,510
Um,

3409
01:43:56,510 --> 01:43:57,380
what I was getting at was,

3410
01:43:57,381 --> 01:43:59,000
do you breed your own chickens?

3411
01:43:59,001 --> 01:43:59,560
Do you,

3412
01:43:59,560 --> 01:43:59,890
do.

3413
01:43:59,890 --> 01:44:00,980
We have just started,

3414
01:44:00,981 --> 01:44:01,671
we've just started.

3415
01:44:01,671 --> 01:44:02,870
We haven't in the past.

3416
01:44:02,871 --> 01:44:04,280
We've always gotten it from a hatchery.

3417
01:44:04,610 --> 01:44:06,440
But what we've seen,

3418
01:44:06,441 --> 01:44:07,940
you'd find this fascinating.

3419
01:44:07,941 --> 01:44:10,460
I'm sure what we've
seen is in my lifetime,

3420
01:44:10,461 --> 01:44:11,330
and I'm not that old,

3421
01:44:11,810 --> 01:44:16,610
but I have watched the genetic
viability of lot of animals,

3422
01:44:16,640 --> 01:44:21,640
of domestic livestock a drop
because of the props that we,

3423
01:44:22,320 --> 01:44:24,410
the crutches that we use antibiotics,

3424
01:44:24,780 --> 01:44:27,380
a hot feed candy bar.

3425
01:44:27,381 --> 01:44:28,850
I called candy bar diets

3426
01:44:30,830 --> 01:44:33,050
and unnatural feeding regimens.

3427
01:44:33,320 --> 01:44:34,153
And so,

3428
01:44:34,700 --> 01:44:35,533
um,

3429
01:44:35,870 --> 01:44:37,850
we have really seen the,

3430
01:44:37,970 --> 01:44:40,190
the strength that the,

3431
01:44:40,400 --> 01:44:40,731
just,

3432
01:44:40,731 --> 01:44:41,564
the,

3433
01:44:41,810 --> 01:44:45,380
the viability of these
farm animals plummet.

3434
01:44:46,220 --> 01:44:47,600
So our son Daniel,

3435
01:44:47,680 --> 01:44:48,020
uh,

3436
01:44:48,020 --> 01:44:48,910
when he was eight,

3437
01:44:49,490 --> 01:44:52,460
started with rabbits and
these are meat rabbits,

3438
01:44:52,461 --> 01:44:53,450
not pet rabbits,

3439
01:44:53,451 --> 01:44:54,380
but their meat rabbits.

3440
01:44:54,770 --> 01:44:56,960
Some friends had a couple of
those and a buck and they,

3441
01:44:56,961 --> 01:44:57,290
uh,

3442
01:44:57,290 --> 01:44:57,560
they,

3443
01:44:57,560 --> 01:44:59,930
they couldn't take them to a new
apartment where they were moving.

3444
01:44:59,931 --> 01:45:00,764
So they said,

3445
01:45:01,130 --> 01:45:01,401
you know,

3446
01:45:01,401 --> 01:45:02,330
would you like these rabbits?

3447
01:45:02,331 --> 01:45:02,451
Well,

3448
01:45:02,451 --> 01:45:02,871
he was Kinda,

3449
01:45:02,871 --> 01:45:03,321
he was eight,

3450
01:45:03,321 --> 01:45:03,680
you know,

3451
01:45:03,680 --> 01:45:06,230
eight years old is about the time
to start an entrepreneur business,

3452
01:45:06,231 --> 01:45:07,064
you know.

3453
01:45:07,340 --> 01:45:08,420
And so he said,

3454
01:45:08,440 --> 01:45:08,550
uh,

3455
01:45:08,550 --> 01:45:08,690
um,

3456
01:45:08,690 --> 01:45:10,280
as I started with chickens when I was 10,

3457
01:45:10,281 --> 01:45:11,420
so I was two years late,

3458
01:45:11,421 --> 01:45:11,760
but,

3459
01:45:11,760 --> 01:45:12,020
uh,

3460
01:45:12,020 --> 01:45:15,230
he started rapping when he
was eight and so he said,

3461
01:45:15,231 --> 01:45:15,351
yeah,

3462
01:45:15,351 --> 01:45:15,650
I'll take,

3463
01:45:15,650 --> 01:45:16,750
I wanted to raise some race,

3464
01:45:16,751 --> 01:45:17,301
some rabbits.

3465
01:45:17,301 --> 01:45:20,570
So he did that and if you read any like,

3466
01:45:20,600 --> 01:45:20,781
you know,

3467
01:45:20,781 --> 01:45:21,860
rabbit rearing book,

3468
01:45:21,861 --> 01:45:23,510
it'll say never give them grass,

3469
01:45:23,511 --> 01:45:23,811
you know,

3470
01:45:23,811 --> 01:45:25,880
don't give them that because
they'll get diarrhea and die.

3471
01:45:26,480 --> 01:45:29,150
And of course that's
exactly what we found.

3472
01:45:29,580 --> 01:45:29,980
But,

3473
01:45:29,980 --> 01:45:30,860
but what he did,

3474
01:45:30,861 --> 01:45:31,191
he did,

3475
01:45:31,191 --> 01:45:32,660
he did what's called line breeding,

3476
01:45:32,661 --> 01:45:34,250
which is kind of a wild breeding.

3477
01:45:34,970 --> 01:45:39,970
And it took him five years to work
through a lot of mortality and calling.

3478
01:45:40,970 --> 01:45:43,790
But in five years the rabbit
started really getting strong,

3479
01:45:44,300 --> 01:45:45,133
vibrant,

3480
01:45:45,500 --> 01:45:46,340
big litters.

3481
01:45:46,490 --> 01:45:47,323
Healthy.

3482
01:45:47,570 --> 01:45:50,300
Now 24 years later,

3483
01:45:50,760 --> 01:45:52,100
they're almost bulletproof.

3484
01:45:53,030 --> 01:45:53,863
And,

3485
01:45:54,940 --> 01:45:56,900
and what we've seen in the,

3486
01:45:56,990 --> 01:45:57,770
in the,

3487
01:45:57,770 --> 01:45:58,130
uh,

3488
01:45:58,130 --> 01:46:03,130
the genetic selection process over that
time of not using any crutches and just

3489
01:46:03,531 --> 01:46:05,000
letting it be kind of a,

3490
01:46:05,300 --> 01:46:05,631
a,

3491
01:46:05,631 --> 01:46:06,110
you know,

3492
01:46:06,110 --> 01:46:11,110
a Darwinian selection process has
made us now want to want to do that,

3493
01:46:12,050 --> 01:46:13,790
duplicate that with our other animals.

3494
01:46:14,390 --> 01:46:15,440
And so we've,

3495
01:46:15,590 --> 01:46:18,200
we started last year with our
chickens taking our oldest,

3496
01:46:18,201 --> 01:46:19,700
what we call survivor genetics,

3497
01:46:19,910 --> 01:46:21,650
the oldest hands that are still laying,

3498
01:46:21,920 --> 01:46:23,360
mating them to the roosters.

3499
01:46:23,630 --> 01:46:26,840
And what we want to do is just
keep taking the oldest hens,

3500
01:46:27,050 --> 01:46:28,400
meeting them back to the,

3501
01:46:28,420 --> 01:46:29,450
meeting them to the roosters.

3502
01:46:29,810 --> 01:46:33,680
So we eventually create
a survivor genetic.

3503
01:46:33,681 --> 01:46:34,460
In other words,

3504
01:46:34,460 --> 01:46:36,740
that's the chicken that new to hide.

3505
01:46:36,740 --> 01:46:37,640
When the Hawk came,

3506
01:46:37,820 --> 01:46:40,760
that's the chicken that knew to get
under shelter when the rain came,

3507
01:46:41,000 --> 01:46:41,880
that's the chicken that,

3508
01:46:42,240 --> 01:46:44,210
that didn't get flu,

3509
01:46:44,211 --> 01:46:46,030
that didn't get bugged,

3510
01:46:46,040 --> 01:46:47,270
that didn't have a prolapse.

3511
01:46:47,271 --> 01:46:48,380
The first eggs she did,

3512
01:46:48,600 --> 01:46:49,433
I mean,

3513
01:46:49,650 --> 01:46:50,940
I call it survivor genetics.

3514
01:46:50,941 --> 01:46:52,350
We're doing that now with our cows.

3515
01:46:52,351 --> 01:46:56,310
We're selecting our own bulls
and breeding from our own bulls.

3516
01:46:56,670 --> 01:47:00,150
And we're very excited about what this,

3517
01:47:00,420 --> 01:47:05,420
this kind of wild line breeding pipe
type of thing can do if you knock out all

3518
01:47:06,301 --> 01:47:07,134
the crutches.

3519
01:47:08,200 --> 01:47:09,033
Um,

3520
01:47:09,480 --> 01:47:14,250
the problem is that it puts you crossways
of the animal welfare crowd because

3521
01:47:14,251 --> 01:47:15,084
they can't,

3522
01:47:15,300 --> 01:47:18,390
they can't abide the idea
that if I have a sick animal,

3523
01:47:18,570 --> 01:47:19,770
I'm just going to let it die.

3524
01:47:20,280 --> 01:47:20,890
Oh,

3525
01:47:20,890 --> 01:47:21,520
you know what I mean?

3526
01:47:21,520 --> 01:47:21,840
You know,

3527
01:47:21,840 --> 01:47:26,100
they've been Bambi and thumper
right into death to where every,

3528
01:47:26,430 --> 01:47:26,881
every,

3529
01:47:26,881 --> 01:47:27,570
um,

3530
01:47:27,570 --> 01:47:27,870
you know,

3531
01:47:27,870 --> 01:47:31,890
every dog and cat has to
have a monogram ll bean,

3532
01:47:31,891 --> 01:47:33,180
cushing in an air condition,

3533
01:47:33,181 --> 01:47:34,014
any room.

3534
01:47:34,110 --> 01:47:34,620
And that's,

3535
01:47:34,620 --> 01:47:36,180
that's the only way to care for animals.

3536
01:47:36,600 --> 01:47:38,850
And the problem is that we don't,

3537
01:47:39,090 --> 01:47:43,170
we're not going to get genetic strength
if we don't let nature call out the weak

3538
01:47:43,171 --> 01:47:43,411
links.

3539
01:47:43,411 --> 01:47:44,250
That's the problem,

3540
01:47:44,670 --> 01:47:45,090
you know?

3541
01:47:45,090 --> 01:47:46,230
And so,

3542
01:47:46,290 --> 01:47:46,620
um,

3543
01:47:46,620 --> 01:47:51,620
so we wouldn't have the vibrant rabbits
that Daniel has if we had started at the

3544
01:47:52,501 --> 01:47:52,890
beginning,

3545
01:47:52,890 --> 01:47:53,131
oh,

3546
01:47:53,131 --> 01:47:54,900
let's properties up with antibiotics.

3547
01:47:54,990 --> 01:47:59,280
So the weak ones can survive if everybody
walks into the room wearing crutches.

3548
01:48:00,090 --> 01:48:02,250
You don't know who can
stand on their own two feet.

3549
01:48:02,730 --> 01:48:06,510
It's only when you start knocking crutches
out that you find out who can stand.

3550
01:48:06,840 --> 01:48:08,910
It's that anthropomorphizing,

3551
01:48:08,911 --> 01:48:09,360
yes,

3552
01:48:09,360 --> 01:48:10,141
absolutely.

3553
01:48:10,141 --> 01:48:12,330
Animals that we wanted.

3554
01:48:12,420 --> 01:48:14,010
We wouldn't do that with people.

3555
01:48:14,040 --> 01:48:15,630
Of course we wouldn't do it with people,

3556
01:48:15,631 --> 01:48:15,900
but

3557
01:48:15,900 --> 01:48:20,520
these are animals and this is the natural
world and this is why animals survive

3558
01:48:20,521 --> 01:48:21,870
and if you don't do that,

3559
01:48:21,871 --> 01:48:23,040
they won't survive.

3560
01:48:23,280 --> 01:48:27,960
Then you'll have the weak ones breed and
develop all sorts of huge issues which

3561
01:48:27,961 --> 01:48:30,630
could be argued essentially that
that's happening with people,

3562
01:48:30,631 --> 01:48:32,400
but people have a lot of
other things to offer.

3563
01:48:32,580 --> 01:48:33,480
Our innovation,

3564
01:48:33,481 --> 01:48:37,620
our creativity and our ability
to communicate and our thinking,

3565
01:48:37,890 --> 01:48:39,840
our what makes us uniquely human.

3566
01:48:39,900 --> 01:48:40,830
The animals,

3567
01:48:40,831 --> 01:48:41,210
it's.

3568
01:48:41,210 --> 01:48:43,230
It's simply their body,

3569
01:48:43,440 --> 01:48:44,250
their life,

3570
01:48:44,250 --> 01:48:44,511
their,

3571
01:48:44,511 --> 01:48:46,890
their existence and the way
they interact with their knee,

3572
01:48:46,950 --> 01:48:47,783
with nature.

3573
01:48:47,950 --> 01:48:49,620
When when you tamper with that,

3574
01:48:49,740 --> 01:48:50,760
when you tamper with that,

3575
01:48:50,761 --> 01:48:50,951
you're.

3576
01:48:50,951 --> 01:48:52,110
You're essentially.

3577
01:48:52,350 --> 01:48:56,160
You're pretending you're smarter than
nature itself and that's ridiculous.

3578
01:48:56,400 --> 01:48:57,233
We can't.

3579
01:48:57,270 --> 01:49:01,530
We can show real clearly by what you've
said today about factory farming,

3580
01:49:02,130 --> 01:49:06,120
about the development of these diseases
that we're not smarter than nature.

3581
01:49:06,121 --> 01:49:07,570
We don't and then we.

3582
01:49:07,740 --> 01:49:12,270
There's no one could know everything
and there's not one person that's smart

3583
01:49:12,271 --> 01:49:14,970
enough to be able to see
the whole big picture.

3584
01:49:15,030 --> 01:49:18,750
We need a lot of other eyes on this and
we need a lot of other thoughts on this

3585
01:49:19,080 --> 01:49:24,080
and when you start applying the
same sort of compassion and that,

3586
01:49:25,340 --> 01:49:27,960
that we rightly due to human beings,

3587
01:49:27,961 --> 01:49:29,220
you start applying them to animals.

3588
01:49:29,221 --> 01:49:30,940
You actually wind up screwing the animals.

3589
01:49:30,941 --> 01:49:31,100
Okay.

3590
01:49:31,100 --> 01:49:31,600
All over.

3591
01:49:31,600 --> 01:49:31,980
Yeah.

3592
01:49:31,980 --> 01:49:32,331
You,

3593
01:49:32,331 --> 01:49:35,140
you create a artificial fragility.

3594
01:49:36,400 --> 01:49:37,181
No Sir.

3595
01:49:37,181 --> 01:49:37,901
Albert Howard,

3596
01:49:37,901 --> 01:49:38,501
who of course,

3597
01:49:38,501 --> 01:49:39,110
you know,

3598
01:49:39,110 --> 01:49:42,850
develop the scientific aerobic
composting process in which it,

3599
01:49:42,930 --> 01:49:46,150
his book is still kind of the icon
of the whole sustainable agriculture

3600
01:49:46,151 --> 01:49:46,984
community.

3601
01:49:47,230 --> 01:49:50,590
It was written in 1943 and
agricultural testament.

3602
01:49:50,860 --> 01:49:53,080
He says in there that when you,

3603
01:49:53,260 --> 01:49:57,860
when you use artificial artificial matures
in the soil and that's what he called

3604
01:49:57,861 --> 01:49:58,840
a chemical fertilizers,

3605
01:49:58,841 --> 01:49:59,830
artificial manures.

3606
01:50:00,400 --> 01:50:04,210
It makes grows artificial plants
which make artificial animals,

3607
01:50:05,140 --> 01:50:09,490
which then make artificial people who
can only stay alive using artificials.

3608
01:50:10,360 --> 01:50:11,830
That was in 1943.

3609
01:50:12,130 --> 01:50:12,890
Wow.

3610
01:50:12,890 --> 01:50:13,860
Wasn't that present?

3611
01:50:14,500 --> 01:50:14,801
Yeah.

3612
01:50:14,801 --> 01:50:15,850
That comes on the ball.

3613
01:50:16,190 --> 01:50:17,560
That was just coming out.

3614
01:50:18,280 --> 01:50:18,461
I mean,

3615
01:50:18,461 --> 01:50:20,780
how long had factory farming
even been around that?

3616
01:50:21,360 --> 01:50:22,120
It wasn't,

3617
01:50:22,120 --> 01:50:23,290
and we were just,

3618
01:50:23,590 --> 01:50:24,640
I mean that was 19,

3619
01:50:24,641 --> 01:50:25,460
43.

3620
01:50:25,460 --> 01:50:29,890
We were just really beginning to start
using chemical fertilizers at that point.

3621
01:50:30,200 --> 01:50:34,850
Now when they have the issue
with large scale agriculture,

3622
01:50:34,880 --> 01:50:38,540
when they chew up all the minerals in
the ground and they have to add minerals

3623
01:50:38,541 --> 01:50:41,730
when they'd go over the top
soil of American farmlands.

3624
01:50:41,740 --> 01:50:41,931
I mean,

3625
01:50:41,931 --> 01:50:42,101
they,

3626
01:50:42,101 --> 01:50:44,510
there was a paper that
was written about it.

3627
01:50:44,570 --> 01:50:44,860
God,

3628
01:50:44,860 --> 01:50:45,830
I can't remember the year,

3629
01:50:45,831 --> 01:50:47,120
but it was a long time ago,

3630
01:50:47,121 --> 01:50:48,860
I believe it was in the 19 forties,

3631
01:50:49,100 --> 01:50:51,320
about the mineral deficiencies of topsoil,

3632
01:50:51,370 --> 01:50:52,290
of topsoil.

3633
01:50:53,010 --> 01:50:53,490
Um,

3634
01:50:53,490 --> 01:50:53,860
what,

3635
01:50:53,860 --> 01:50:55,460
what do they do about that now?

3636
01:50:55,461 --> 01:50:55,821
And it,

3637
01:50:55,821 --> 01:50:58,500
does that same issue still happen?

3638
01:50:58,520 --> 01:50:59,540
A farm like yours?

3639
01:51:00,000 --> 01:51:00,420
Well,

3640
01:51:00,420 --> 01:51:00,610
uh,

3641
01:51:00,610 --> 01:51:01,061
yes,

3642
01:51:01,061 --> 01:51:01,811
absolutely.

3643
01:51:01,811 --> 01:51:02,081
I mean,

3644
01:51:02,081 --> 01:51:03,400
mineral deficiency is a,

3645
01:51:03,460 --> 01:51:04,900
is a major problem in nature.

3646
01:51:04,901 --> 01:51:08,740
Fortunately a nature has
a mechanism to remedy it.

3647
01:51:09,430 --> 01:51:10,263
Um,

3648
01:51:10,590 --> 01:51:10,840
you know,

3649
01:51:10,840 --> 01:51:14,980
amazingly it's onsite doesn't
need a bunch of stuff brought in.

3650
01:51:15,310 --> 01:51:19,240
And the way nature remedies is
with an act of decomposition cycle,

3651
01:51:19,750 --> 01:51:23,470
the way it works is when organic
matter decomposes into the soil,

3652
01:51:24,850 --> 01:51:25,720
it gives off,

3653
01:51:25,721 --> 01:51:28,750
it exudes carbon dioxide when things rot,

3654
01:51:29,020 --> 01:51:30,430
they give off carbon dioxide.

3655
01:51:32,050 --> 01:51:33,870
And so that carbon dioxide as it,

3656
01:51:34,010 --> 01:51:37,180
as it percolates up through
the pores in the soil,

3657
01:51:37,230 --> 01:51:37,360
you know,

3658
01:51:37,360 --> 01:51:39,010
the aggregates in the soil.

3659
01:51:39,310 --> 01:51:41,800
If you look at the soil
and an electron microscope,

3660
01:51:42,010 --> 01:51:43,660
it really looks like a marsh,

3661
01:51:44,490 --> 01:51:44,810
you know,

3662
01:51:44,810 --> 01:51:49,450
there's all these little cavities and
aggregates and moisture and all these,

3663
01:51:49,770 --> 01:51:50,320
you know,

3664
01:51:50,320 --> 01:51:52,150
slogging weird looking,

3665
01:51:52,270 --> 01:51:52,541
you know,

3666
01:51:52,541 --> 01:51:57,460
bugs and cal looking things
and predators and herbivores.

3667
01:51:57,461 --> 01:51:58,010
And uh,

3668
01:51:58,010 --> 01:51:58,261
it,

3669
01:51:58,261 --> 01:51:58,480
it's,

3670
01:51:58,480 --> 01:51:59,080
it's an entire,

3671
01:51:59,080 --> 01:51:59,260
you know,

3672
01:51:59,260 --> 01:51:59,660
there,

3673
01:51:59,660 --> 01:52:03,790
there are more living beings and a double
handful of healthy soil than there are

3674
01:52:03,791 --> 01:52:04,930
people on the face of the earth.

3675
01:52:05,170 --> 01:52:05,850
Whoa.

3676
01:52:05,850 --> 01:52:06,190
That,

3677
01:52:06,190 --> 01:52:07,630
that's how alive it is.

3678
01:52:08,970 --> 01:52:09,580
Yeah.

3679
01:52:09,580 --> 01:52:10,660
That's crazy.

3680
01:52:10,720 --> 01:52:11,020
Yeah.

3681
01:52:11,020 --> 01:52:11,650
So,

3682
01:52:11,650 --> 01:52:12,820
so when that,

3683
01:52:12,850 --> 01:52:13,630
when that car,

3684
01:52:13,630 --> 01:52:17,950
when that carbon dioxide
eases up through the,

3685
01:52:18,010 --> 01:52:20,230
through the aggregates in this,

3686
01:52:20,260 --> 01:52:22,330
in this kind of marshy soil,

3687
01:52:23,260 --> 01:52:24,640
it encounters h,

3688
01:52:24,641 --> 01:52:25,960
two o water,

3689
01:52:26,300 --> 01:52:26,560
alright,

3690
01:52:26,560 --> 01:52:27,550
in those aggregates.

3691
01:52:28,240 --> 01:52:29,650
And when the CEO,

3692
01:52:29,651 --> 01:52:31,150
two hits H,

3693
01:52:31,151 --> 01:52:34,360
two o it makes carbonic acid.

3694
01:52:35,380 --> 01:52:35,561
Now,

3695
01:52:35,561 --> 01:52:36,760
carbonic acid.

3696
01:52:37,360 --> 01:52:38,193
Uh,

3697
01:52:38,640 --> 01:52:39,060
if,

3698
01:52:39,060 --> 01:52:39,220
uh,

3699
01:52:39,220 --> 01:52:39,950
if we took,

3700
01:52:39,950 --> 01:52:44,950
if we said that this is a rock right here
and we want to find out how much zinc,

3701
01:52:45,770 --> 01:52:46,430
cobalt,

3702
01:52:46,430 --> 01:52:47,270
molybdenum,

3703
01:52:48,570 --> 01:52:49,910
no aluminum,

3704
01:52:49,911 --> 01:52:51,380
whatever is in this rock,

3705
01:52:51,650 --> 01:52:54,290
we could treat it with lots of reagents.

3706
01:52:54,291 --> 01:52:55,760
We could use sulfuric acid,

3707
01:52:55,761 --> 01:52:56,810
hydrochloric acid,

3708
01:52:56,811 --> 01:52:56,920
you know,

3709
01:52:56,920 --> 01:52:58,280
we could use lots of different acids.

3710
01:52:59,090 --> 01:53:03,170
Guess which one is the most
efficient asset to use?

3711
01:53:04,160 --> 01:53:05,060
Carbonic acid.

3712
01:53:06,170 --> 01:53:06,501
So,

3713
01:53:06,501 --> 01:53:07,430
so nature,

3714
01:53:07,450 --> 01:53:07,780
you know,

3715
01:53:07,780 --> 01:53:08,050
so,

3716
01:53:08,050 --> 01:53:13,050
so creation has this
wonderful ability if there is,

3717
01:53:13,580 --> 01:53:16,460
if there is carbon decomposing in the soil

3718
01:53:18,420 --> 01:53:19,500
and moisture,

3719
01:53:19,980 --> 01:53:24,980
that creates a carbonic acid to break
out the minerals that are in the parent

3720
01:53:26,131 --> 01:53:27,540
rock material in the soil.

3721
01:53:27,720 --> 01:53:28,410
If I went out,

3722
01:53:28,410 --> 01:53:32,820
if I went outside the studio here and
picked up a rock and brought it in and

3723
01:53:32,821 --> 01:53:33,654
said,

3724
01:53:33,960 --> 01:53:34,793
is that rock?

3725
01:53:34,800 --> 01:53:36,590
Does it contain the same minerals?

3726
01:53:36,591 --> 01:53:36,990
And I mean,

3727
01:53:36,990 --> 01:53:37,350
is it,

3728
01:53:37,350 --> 01:53:41,160
is it the same thing as
it was 2000 years ago?

3729
01:53:41,220 --> 01:53:42,060
You'd say yes.

3730
01:53:42,150 --> 01:53:43,350
I mean that's the rock.

3731
01:53:43,351 --> 01:53:44,060
I mean it's,

3732
01:53:44,060 --> 01:53:44,390
you know,

3733
01:53:44,390 --> 01:53:45,570
there's not a big hole through it.

3734
01:53:45,571 --> 01:53:45,751
You know,

3735
01:53:45,751 --> 01:53:46,140
yeah,

3736
01:53:46,140 --> 01:53:46,380
that's,

3737
01:53:46,380 --> 01:53:47,213
that's the way it was.

3738
01:53:48,230 --> 01:53:48,570
And,

3739
01:53:48,570 --> 01:53:51,930
and so we have plenty
of parent mineral in,

3740
01:53:52,320 --> 01:53:52,950
you know,

3741
01:53:52,950 --> 01:53:53,783
out here.

3742
01:53:53,970 --> 01:53:57,420
The problem is we don't have
an active decomposition cycle.

3743
01:53:58,560 --> 01:53:59,790
How do you,

3744
01:53:59,970 --> 01:54:04,050
how do you destroy a decomposition cycle?

3745
01:54:04,470 --> 01:54:09,470
You do it when you don't feed
this when you don't have a carbon,

3746
01:54:10,080 --> 01:54:11,760
a carbon centric system.

3747
01:54:12,360 --> 01:54:17,360
And everything about modern farming
is trying to get rid of carbon.

3748
01:54:18,800 --> 01:54:19,210
We,

3749
01:54:19,210 --> 01:54:21,180
this is one of the things
that we're looking at.

3750
01:54:21,181 --> 01:54:23,100
Maybe if you've read the
book called Wheat Belly,

3751
01:54:24,240 --> 01:54:25,073
um,

3752
01:54:25,470 --> 01:54:25,880
about,

3753
01:54:25,880 --> 01:54:26,131
you know,

3754
01:54:26,131 --> 01:54:26,860
gluten and,

3755
01:54:26,860 --> 01:54:31,860
and those sorts of things is
that you used to be a win.

3756
01:54:31,921 --> 01:54:33,510
Our grand puppies,

3757
01:54:33,511 --> 01:54:35,610
we're planting wheat.

3758
01:54:36,100 --> 01:54:37,200
Wheat would grow,

3759
01:54:37,600 --> 01:54:38,290
um,

3760
01:54:38,290 --> 01:54:38,700
you know,

3761
01:54:38,700 --> 01:54:39,690
six feet tall.

3762
01:54:39,780 --> 01:54:40,381
It was real,

3763
01:54:40,381 --> 01:54:42,180
real tall so that the,

3764
01:54:42,390 --> 01:54:46,400
the grain to stem ratio
was whatever it was,

3765
01:54:46,401 --> 01:54:46,560
you know,

3766
01:54:46,560 --> 01:54:47,393
the ratio.

3767
01:54:47,670 --> 01:54:48,503
Well,

3768
01:54:50,040 --> 01:54:51,720
the taller the wheat,

3769
01:54:51,840 --> 01:54:53,370
the taller the stalk,

3770
01:54:55,140 --> 01:54:57,000
the less weight it can hold out there,

3771
01:54:57,001 --> 01:54:57,430
you know,

3772
01:54:57,430 --> 01:54:57,571
it,

3773
01:54:57,571 --> 01:54:58,950
it wants to fall over,

3774
01:54:58,951 --> 01:54:59,151
you know,

3775
01:54:59,151 --> 01:54:59,984
because you go,

3776
01:55:00,040 --> 01:55:01,710
the skyscraper gets taller and Taller,

3777
01:55:01,711 --> 01:55:02,544
right?

3778
01:55:02,670 --> 01:55:05,700
And so in genetics and genetic
breeding and selection,

3779
01:55:05,701 --> 01:55:09,370
what we've done in the
last 50 years is shortened,

3780
01:55:10,110 --> 01:55:14,790
is selected shorter and
shorter and shorter and
shorter cultivars down to where

3781
01:55:14,791 --> 01:55:18,570
it's a very short stem and that
ratio has fundamentally changed,

3782
01:55:18,870 --> 01:55:23,870
which also affects the enzymes and the
nutrient components of those seed heads.

3783
01:55:24,810 --> 01:55:29,810
But we can combine it faster and we can
grow a bigger head on a smaller plant.

3784
01:55:30,270 --> 01:55:31,590
But guess what we also did,

3785
01:55:31,710 --> 01:55:36,710
we also deprived the soil of the carbon
that the straw and the stock would

3786
01:55:37,981 --> 01:55:42,981
produce from a given amount of grain
that deprive the soil of the carbon

3787
01:55:44,011 --> 01:55:48,060
injection that was supposed to come
when we took the grain head off.

3788
01:55:49,080 --> 01:55:53,340
And now we don't have that
carbon decomposition cycle.

3789
01:55:54,070 --> 01:55:54,700
Wow.

3790
01:55:54,700 --> 01:55:58,450
And so the solution to
that in the industrial way,

3791
01:55:58,490 --> 01:55:59,830
it's just admin

3792
01:56:01,370 --> 01:56:02,580
admin or you know,

3793
01:56:02,650 --> 01:56:05,170
mine mineral somewhere else and,

3794
01:56:05,550 --> 01:56:06,240
and uh,

3795
01:56:06,240 --> 01:56:07,073
and add them.

3796
01:56:07,600 --> 01:56:09,160
But all that can be done in house.

3797
01:56:09,610 --> 01:56:11,410
It can absolutely can
all be done in house.

3798
01:56:11,440 --> 01:56:12,830
The wheat issue is,

3799
01:56:12,920 --> 01:56:15,760
is a big one with the Americans today.

3800
01:56:15,970 --> 01:56:19,570
Everyone wants to be gluten
free and I'm guilty of it too.

3801
01:56:19,571 --> 01:56:24,220
I stopped eating gluten reading recently
and I found that almost immediately,

3802
01:56:24,221 --> 01:56:25,690
like I felt more,

3803
01:56:26,770 --> 01:56:29,800
I felt less bloated after a meal,

3804
01:56:29,801 --> 01:56:30,530
if that's a good term,

3805
01:56:30,530 --> 01:56:32,410
less dated after a meal.

3806
01:56:32,590 --> 01:56:32,891
I just,

3807
01:56:32,891 --> 01:56:34,210
I didn't feel so tired.

3808
01:56:34,570 --> 01:56:35,403
And uh,

3809
01:56:35,860 --> 01:56:37,050
when I started reading about it,

3810
01:56:37,060 --> 01:56:40,870
I read that when we had been changed to,

3811
01:56:40,871 --> 01:56:41,200
uh,

3812
01:56:41,200 --> 01:56:42,910
to change the size of it,

3813
01:56:42,911 --> 01:56:44,080
to make it more hardy,

3814
01:56:44,380 --> 01:56:47,110
it also became more difficult to digest.

3815
01:56:47,440 --> 01:56:48,010
Yes,

3816
01:56:48,010 --> 01:56:48,761
absolutely.

3817
01:56:48,761 --> 01:56:50,680
Is it possible to get that old wheat back?

3818
01:56:50,740 --> 01:56:51,251
Absolutely.

3819
01:56:51,251 --> 01:56:52,720
There are people doing it right now.

3820
01:56:52,721 --> 01:56:52,971
I mean,

3821
01:56:52,971 --> 01:56:54,130
now Washington state,

3822
01:56:54,131 --> 01:56:55,630
the old red,

3823
01:56:55,750 --> 01:56:58,210
red rife a heritage varieties.

3824
01:56:58,420 --> 01:56:59,170
Absolutely.

3825
01:56:59,170 --> 01:56:59,550
You can,

3826
01:56:59,550 --> 01:57:00,383
they're there.

3827
01:57:00,500 --> 01:57:01,241
They're available.

3828
01:57:01,241 --> 01:57:02,074
You can buy them.

3829
01:57:02,450 --> 01:57:02,720
Yeah.

3830
01:57:02,720 --> 01:57:03,381
So how do you,

3831
01:57:03,381 --> 01:57:03,800
uh,

3832
01:57:03,800 --> 01:57:04,521
get bread?

3833
01:57:04,521 --> 01:57:05,354
That's that?

3834
01:57:06,640 --> 01:57:06,881
Well,

3835
01:57:06,881 --> 01:57:07,580
you,

3836
01:57:07,580 --> 01:57:07,810
uh,

3837
01:57:07,810 --> 01:57:08,180
you,

3838
01:57:08,180 --> 01:57:08,431
I mean,

3839
01:57:08,431 --> 01:57:11,700
you can have your own flour mill
if you want to buy it by the bag.

3840
01:57:11,701 --> 01:57:12,960
That sounds like a pain in the ass,

3841
01:57:13,590 --> 01:57:14,423
you know,

3842
01:57:14,860 --> 01:57:19,860
that that's where modern times are really
exciting because we now have techno

3843
01:57:21,360 --> 01:57:23,400
glitzy gadgets in our kitchens.

3844
01:57:24,050 --> 01:57:24,380
Uh,

3845
01:57:24,380 --> 01:57:25,260
when people ask me,

3846
01:57:25,261 --> 01:57:25,470
you know,

3847
01:57:25,470 --> 01:57:25,950
what's,

3848
01:57:25,950 --> 01:57:30,180
what's the most important thing a person
can do to advance the integrity food

3849
01:57:30,181 --> 01:57:30,900
movement?

3850
01:57:30,900 --> 01:57:33,270
My first answer is get in your kitchen.

3851
01:57:34,590 --> 01:57:36,390
And I'm not talking about hoop skirts.

3852
01:57:36,391 --> 01:57:37,141
Hearth cooking,

3853
01:57:37,141 --> 01:57:37,980
washboards,

3854
01:57:38,490 --> 01:57:38,941
barefoot,

3855
01:57:38,941 --> 01:57:39,840
pregnant in the kitchen.

3856
01:57:40,130 --> 01:57:40,890
Uh,

3857
01:57:40,890 --> 01:57:45,840
I'm talking about embracing techno
glitzy gadgetry that we have today.

3858
01:57:45,841 --> 01:57:48,620
The kitchens we have today
are not grandma's kitchens,

3859
01:57:48,930 --> 01:57:49,111
you know,

3860
01:57:49,111 --> 01:57:49,460
I mean,

3861
01:57:49,460 --> 01:57:49,801
we've got,

3862
01:57:49,801 --> 01:57:51,750
we've got two faucets with running water,

3863
01:57:51,930 --> 01:57:52,380
you know,

3864
01:57:52,380 --> 01:57:52,891
one's hot,

3865
01:57:52,891 --> 01:57:53,724
one's cold.

3866
01:57:53,850 --> 01:57:54,430
Uh,

3867
01:57:54,430 --> 01:57:54,720
I mean,

3868
01:57:54,720 --> 01:57:56,100
we've got ovens,

3869
01:57:56,101 --> 01:57:57,630
we've got refrigeration,

3870
01:57:57,631 --> 01:57:58,740
we've got stainless steel,

3871
01:57:58,741 --> 01:57:59,720
we've got Queensland Arts,

3872
01:57:59,730 --> 01:58:01,320
we've got blenders and,

3873
01:58:01,321 --> 01:58:02,190
and cool little,

3874
01:58:02,420 --> 01:58:02,870
you know,

3875
01:58:02,870 --> 01:58:03,530
um,

3876
01:58:03,530 --> 01:58:04,010
uh,

3877
01:58:04,010 --> 01:58:04,500
you know,

3878
01:58:04,500 --> 01:58:06,420
mills and flour mills and stuff.

3879
01:58:06,690 --> 01:58:07,523
And so,

3880
01:58:07,680 --> 01:58:08,513
um,

3881
01:58:08,850 --> 01:58:09,151
so,

3882
01:58:09,151 --> 01:58:09,984
you know,

3883
01:58:10,020 --> 01:58:10,291
uh,

3884
01:58:10,291 --> 01:58:10,680
when,

3885
01:58:10,680 --> 01:58:11,290
when we buy,

3886
01:58:11,290 --> 01:58:16,290
we buy 25 pounds a week of
a flower at a time and a,

3887
01:58:16,411 --> 01:58:17,730
you can absolutely get it,

3888
01:58:17,790 --> 01:58:18,031
you know,

3889
01:58:18,031 --> 01:58:23,031
as bulk and you can use this gadgetry
and grind it up and bake your own bread

3890
01:58:23,430 --> 01:58:24,090
and in,

3891
01:58:24,090 --> 01:58:24,720
in a,

3892
01:58:24,720 --> 01:58:27,270
in a computerized breadmaker wow.

3893
01:58:27,300 --> 01:58:28,620
God won't never had it so well,

3894
01:58:28,740 --> 01:58:32,850
it's never been easier to
actually eat well than today ever.

3895
01:58:33,050 --> 01:58:33,883
That's interesting.

3896
01:58:34,310 --> 01:58:35,480
That's so true.

3897
01:58:35,600 --> 01:58:35,930
Well,

3898
01:58:35,930 --> 01:58:36,711
if you have the money,

3899
01:58:36,711 --> 01:58:36,921
right,

3900
01:58:36,921 --> 01:58:39,740
that's the big knock on organic food,

3901
01:58:40,070 --> 01:58:40,320
you know,

3902
01:58:40,320 --> 01:58:40,500
that,

3903
01:58:40,500 --> 01:58:40,791
you know,

3904
01:58:40,791 --> 01:58:42,130
most people don't have the money

3905
01:58:42,130 --> 01:58:44,150
to go to whole foods or oral,

3906
01:58:45,080 --> 01:58:46,150
that'd be addressed the money.

3907
01:58:46,151 --> 01:58:49,510
The way to address the
money is to eat whole foods,

3908
01:58:49,511 --> 01:58:50,740
not processed foods.

3909
01:58:52,640 --> 01:58:53,140
You,

3910
01:58:53,140 --> 01:58:55,090
I'm sure you're familiar
with the movie food inc.

3911
01:58:55,930 --> 01:58:56,441
And of course,

3912
01:58:56,441 --> 01:58:56,620
you know,

3913
01:58:56,620 --> 01:58:59,020
as a powerful movie a very profound.

3914
01:58:59,320 --> 01:59:01,560
But there's A real weakness
in that movie where that,

3915
01:59:01,600 --> 01:59:01,721
you know,

3916
01:59:01,721 --> 01:59:04,210
that family that goes to
burger king and they bow that,

3917
01:59:04,211 --> 01:59:04,331
you know,

3918
01:59:04,331 --> 01:59:07,380
they buy a whopper or whatever
they get and they buy a it look,

3919
01:59:07,420 --> 01:59:07,931
it looks like a,

3920
01:59:07,931 --> 01:59:08,111
like a,

3921
01:59:08,111 --> 01:59:08,330
you know,

3922
01:59:08,330 --> 01:59:10,180
200 outside soft drink,

3923
01:59:10,181 --> 01:59:10,541
but you know,

3924
01:59:10,541 --> 01:59:11,141
whatever it is,

3925
01:59:11,141 --> 01:59:13,570
it's a big one and french fries.

3926
01:59:13,750 --> 01:59:18,010
And then they say they can't
afford to buy produce vegetables.

3927
01:59:19,480 --> 01:59:22,000
The fact is that meal,

3928
01:59:22,480 --> 01:59:22,820
uh,

3929
01:59:22,820 --> 01:59:23,060
you know,

3930
01:59:23,060 --> 01:59:23,500
I don't,

3931
01:59:23,500 --> 01:59:24,460
I don't eat at burger king,

3932
01:59:24,461 --> 01:59:25,294
but anyway,

3933
01:59:25,300 --> 01:59:26,133
they're all the same.

3934
01:59:26,430 --> 01:59:27,040
Um,

3935
01:59:27,040 --> 01:59:32,040
that meal costs no more than two whole
pounds of our polyface grass fattened

3936
01:59:35,531 --> 01:59:38,740
grass finished worldclass ground beef.

3937
01:59:39,430 --> 01:59:44,170
And there's more nutrition in half a
pound of my ground beef than there is in

3938
01:59:44,171 --> 01:59:47,740
that entire meal fast food meal.

3939
01:59:48,670 --> 01:59:50,710
So when somebody says
they can't afford it,

3940
01:59:51,610 --> 01:59:53,500
the first thing I do
is I want to grab him.

3941
01:59:53,501 --> 01:59:53,651
I said,

3942
01:59:53,651 --> 01:59:53,801
okay,

3943
01:59:53,801 --> 01:59:55,720
let's go to your house and here's what.

3944
01:59:55,721 --> 01:59:56,381
We're not going to find it.

3945
01:59:56,381 --> 01:59:59,290
We're not going to find any fast
food boxes or fast food receipts.

3946
01:59:59,530 --> 02:00:01,090
We're not going to find soda,

3947
02:00:01,540 --> 02:00:02,410
alcohol,

3948
02:00:02,590 --> 02:00:03,430
tobacco,

3949
02:00:03,730 --> 02:00:04,563
coffee,

3950
02:00:05,170 --> 02:00:06,520
widescreen tvs.

3951
02:00:06,880 --> 02:00:10,180
We're not going to find $100 designer
jeans with holes already in the knees.

3952
02:00:10,660 --> 02:00:14,140
We're not going to find a know netflix,

3953
02:00:14,200 --> 02:00:15,310
people magazine,

3954
02:00:15,580 --> 02:00:16,630
you name your thing.

3955
02:00:16,631 --> 02:00:16,910
Um,

3956
02:00:16,910 --> 02:00:17,141
I'm,

3957
02:00:17,141 --> 02:00:17,620
you know,

3958
02:00:17,620 --> 02:00:19,900
I'm a lottery tickets.

3959
02:00:19,901 --> 02:00:20,734
That's a big one.

3960
02:00:21,040 --> 02:00:21,873
Okay?

3961
02:00:22,450 --> 02:00:26,290
You show me the house that
doesn't have any of those things.

3962
02:00:26,830 --> 02:00:28,360
And then let's talk about price.

3963
02:00:28,810 --> 02:00:30,550
Talk about what you actually can afford.

3964
02:00:30,650 --> 02:00:31,480
Talk about what you want to you.

3965
02:00:31,480 --> 02:00:32,313
Actually,

3966
02:00:32,390 --> 02:00:37,390
because my position is we choose even
even 95 percent of poor people still have

3967
02:00:40,571 --> 02:00:41,530
most of those things.

3968
02:00:42,340 --> 02:00:44,230
We choose what we're willing to buy.

3969
02:00:44,440 --> 02:00:47,680
You can buy wheat by the bushel,

3970
02:00:48,100 --> 02:00:48,933
you can make,

3971
02:00:49,090 --> 02:00:54,090
you can make $800 worth of
bread from a $6 bushel of wheat.

3972
02:00:56,140 --> 02:00:59,380
What it means is you have to
participate in the food system.

3973
02:00:59,970 --> 02:01:00,700
This,

3974
02:01:00,700 --> 02:01:04,360
this is our proBlem is not that it's
not available or we can't get it or we

3975
02:01:04,361 --> 02:01:05,350
don't know what to do.

3976
02:01:05,590 --> 02:01:07,390
Our problem is that we want convenience.

3977
02:01:07,660 --> 02:01:08,560
We don't want to have to think.

3978
02:01:08,561 --> 02:01:09,310
We don't have to.

3979
02:01:09,310 --> 02:01:10,720
We don't want to have to plan ahead.

3980
02:01:10,721 --> 02:01:12,640
We don't have to want to plan menus.

3981
02:01:12,641 --> 02:01:13,130
We,

3982
02:01:13,130 --> 02:01:18,130
we want to just a convenient spontaneity
and you cannot have an integrity

3983
02:01:19,361 --> 02:01:21,580
economic sector of anything.

3984
02:01:21,640 --> 02:01:22,473
Automobiles,

3985
02:01:22,510 --> 02:01:23,080
food,

3986
02:01:23,080 --> 02:01:23,860
clothes,

3987
02:01:23,860 --> 02:01:24,693
entertainment.

3988
02:01:25,180 --> 02:01:26,950
You cannot have an integrity,

3989
02:01:27,100 --> 02:01:32,100
economic sector of anything when
you so profoundly abdicate personal

3990
02:01:32,771 --> 02:01:34,840
participation in that economic sector.

3991
02:01:35,040 --> 02:01:38,590
It is more expensive when you go to
a supermarket and you buy organic

3992
02:01:38,591 --> 02:01:39,290
vegetables.

3993
02:01:39,290 --> 02:01:39,980
Oh yeah,

3994
02:01:39,980 --> 02:01:40,161
yeah,

3995
02:01:40,161 --> 02:01:40,994
it is.

3996
02:01:41,120 --> 02:01:41,451
It is.

3997
02:01:41,451 --> 02:01:42,350
And some of the better.

3998
02:01:42,770 --> 02:01:43,603
They are better.

3999
02:01:44,060 --> 02:01:44,540
Yeah.

4000
02:01:44,540 --> 02:01:45,980
Are they better scientific?

4001
02:01:46,090 --> 02:01:46,890
Well,

4002
02:01:46,890 --> 02:01:47,723
let,

4003
02:01:47,960 --> 02:01:48,190
let,

4004
02:01:48,190 --> 02:01:49,023
let me say this.

4005
02:01:49,220 --> 02:01:50,410
I'm a,

4006
02:01:50,850 --> 02:01:52,280
I don't want to get,

4007
02:01:52,320 --> 02:01:52,620
you know,

4008
02:01:52,620 --> 02:01:53,500
crossways of,

4009
02:01:53,570 --> 02:01:54,403
of every.

4010
02:01:54,640 --> 02:01:54,880
Well,

4011
02:01:54,880 --> 02:01:55,681
I guess I might as well.

4012
02:01:55,681 --> 02:01:57,530
I might as well get crossways
with everything out there.

4013
02:01:57,810 --> 02:01:58,643
Um,

4014
02:01:58,740 --> 02:01:59,750
in my view,

4015
02:01:59,870 --> 02:02:00,160
you know,

4016
02:02:00,160 --> 02:02:02,060
we should just not eat
from the supermarket.

4017
02:02:03,930 --> 02:02:04,900
Don't eat from superman.

4018
02:02:05,020 --> 02:02:05,540
No.

4019
02:02:05,540 --> 02:02:06,480
Where do you get your food?

4020
02:02:07,040 --> 02:02:07,200
Oh,

4021
02:02:07,200 --> 02:02:07,710
you get it.

4022
02:02:07,710 --> 02:02:09,540
You get it from farmer's market.

4023
02:02:09,541 --> 02:02:11,650
You get it from a community
supported agriculture,

4024
02:02:11,710 --> 02:02:14,730
food buying club of
metropolitan food club.

4025
02:02:15,660 --> 02:02:17,580
You go to go to farmers,

4026
02:02:18,140 --> 02:02:19,080
buy bulk.

4027
02:02:19,410 --> 02:02:23,490
I mean the way to deal with the prices
by it unprocessed and by volume,

4028
02:02:24,060 --> 02:02:27,440
which means that you have to
recreate your domestic larder.

4029
02:02:27,450 --> 02:02:27,601
You know,

4030
02:02:27,601 --> 02:02:29,070
we don't even use that word anymore.

4031
02:02:29,071 --> 02:02:29,904
Larder,

4032
02:02:30,070 --> 02:02:31,320
who's ever heard that word,

4033
02:02:31,500 --> 02:02:33,750
but that's where all the
food was eight years ago.

4034
02:02:33,751 --> 02:02:36,330
If I came to la and said,

4035
02:02:36,331 --> 02:02:37,440
where's the food in la?

4036
02:02:37,441 --> 02:02:38,520
It's not in a warehouse.

4037
02:02:38,550 --> 02:02:41,610
It would be an individual
larders in houses.

4038
02:02:42,090 --> 02:02:45,300
And so when you buy in bulk

4039
02:02:46,830 --> 02:02:51,830
and you buy unprocessed and you put
your sweat equity into preparing,

4040
02:02:54,181 --> 02:02:54,871
processing,

4041
02:02:54,871 --> 02:02:56,700
preserving and packaging,

4042
02:02:57,720 --> 02:03:02,400
then you can actually save money
over the process counterpart.

4043
02:03:03,510 --> 02:03:04,343
That's incredible.

4044
02:03:04,680 --> 02:03:05,340
In other words,

4045
02:03:05,340 --> 02:03:06,300
you can get,

4046
02:03:06,600 --> 02:03:08,190
you can get top of the line.

4047
02:03:08,460 --> 02:03:11,100
I'm a local,

4048
02:03:11,730 --> 02:03:16,730
the best stuff in the world that's
cheaper than the processed stuff in the

4049
02:03:17,551 --> 02:03:18,384
supermarket.

4050
02:03:18,510 --> 02:03:19,410
I went to,

4051
02:03:19,490 --> 02:03:20,100
um,

4052
02:03:20,100 --> 02:03:21,780
the green markets in New York city,

4053
02:03:21,960 --> 02:03:24,960
arguably the most expensive
farmer's market in the country.

4054
02:03:25,230 --> 02:03:26,250
I asked my hostess,

4055
02:03:26,251 --> 02:03:26,970
I said,

4056
02:03:26,970 --> 02:03:27,930
would you do something for me?

4057
02:03:28,320 --> 02:03:31,800
Could you take me to the vendor with
the most expensive potato in America?

4058
02:03:32,760 --> 02:03:33,290
So she,

4059
02:03:33,290 --> 02:03:33,380
oh,

4060
02:03:33,380 --> 02:03:34,580
I know exactly who we needed to go to.

4061
02:03:34,600 --> 02:03:38,460
So we went down to the stalls there and
there was a vendor there that had about

4062
02:03:38,461 --> 02:03:40,170
20 varieties of potatoes.

4063
02:03:40,290 --> 02:03:40,891
They were beautiful.

4064
02:03:40,891 --> 02:03:42,150
He had them in little little,

4065
02:03:42,151 --> 02:03:42,291
uh,

4066
02:03:42,291 --> 02:03:43,124
you know,

4067
02:03:43,140 --> 02:03:46,470
box cubbies known as beautiful
wooden slanted display.

4068
02:03:46,800 --> 02:03:49,290
There were red ones and yellow ones and
green ones and blue ones and all this.

4069
02:03:49,530 --> 02:03:51,960
So I looked through the boxes and
I found the most expensive one.

4070
02:03:51,961 --> 02:03:52,680
It was a,

4071
02:03:52,680 --> 02:03:54,240
it was a little a heirloom,

4072
02:03:54,241 --> 02:03:59,241
peruvian blue fingerling
potatoes for $2 a pound.

4073
02:03:59,400 --> 02:04:00,750
That's expensive for a potato.

4074
02:04:01,350 --> 02:04:02,160
But you know,

4075
02:04:02,160 --> 02:04:02,993
you know what,

4076
02:04:03,480 --> 02:04:04,980
you know where most potatoes,

4077
02:04:05,010 --> 02:04:07,530
how much space was being
sold in New York city.

4078
02:04:08,730 --> 02:04:10,890
$4 a pound as potato chips.

4079
02:04:11,640 --> 02:04:12,473
Hmm.

4080
02:04:13,200 --> 02:04:14,580
We've got queensland arch,

4081
02:04:14,581 --> 02:04:15,570
we've got slicers,

4082
02:04:15,571 --> 02:04:16,091
deisseroth,

4083
02:04:16,091 --> 02:04:16,980
and fry babies.

4084
02:04:19,500 --> 02:04:24,300
You can get the most expensive potato
in America and it's half the price to

4085
02:04:24,301 --> 02:04:25,134
potato chips.

4086
02:04:25,170 --> 02:04:26,700
Potato chips is not food.

4087
02:04:26,790 --> 02:04:27,720
I mean it is,

4088
02:04:27,721 --> 02:04:28,411
but it's not.

4089
02:04:28,411 --> 02:04:33,180
I mean it's a snack and people pay for
convenience and you get a real honest to

4090
02:04:33,181 --> 02:04:37,080
goodness potato and slice it
yourself and fried in lard.

4091
02:04:37,170 --> 02:04:38,003
A frog baby.

4092
02:04:38,070 --> 02:04:38,940
That is food.

4093
02:04:39,050 --> 02:04:39,741
It is food.

4094
02:04:39,741 --> 02:04:41,720
But what I'm saying is most
people when they get it,

4095
02:04:41,721 --> 02:04:44,090
they get it as a snack and
they don't have the time.

4096
02:04:44,390 --> 02:04:46,160
When someone buys a bag of chips,

4097
02:04:46,400 --> 02:04:49,970
they're not going to go to the
store and get a potato and slice it.

4098
02:04:49,971 --> 02:04:52,850
And in this modern world that we live in,

4099
02:04:52,851 --> 02:04:54,950
I'm saying I know in this modern world,

4100
02:04:54,980 --> 02:04:58,690
so we should essentially go direct
to farmers and go to farmer's markets

4101
02:04:58,700 --> 02:05:00,620
whenever possible and
you save a ton of money,

4102
02:05:00,720 --> 02:05:01,710
save a ton of money.

4103
02:05:01,890 --> 02:05:03,030
Mother earth news.

4104
02:05:03,031 --> 02:05:05,610
This issue actually has a,

4105
02:05:05,611 --> 02:05:06,100
um,

4106
02:05:06,100 --> 02:05:09,120
a big spreadsheet where
they did exactly that.

4107
02:05:09,121 --> 02:05:14,121
They have a whole bunch of items
that they bought at the supermarket,

4108
02:05:14,280 --> 02:05:15,630
at the farmer's market.

4109
02:05:15,631 --> 02:05:15,820
And,

4110
02:05:15,820 --> 02:05:16,130
and,

4111
02:05:16,130 --> 02:05:16,890
um,

4112
02:05:16,890 --> 02:05:18,270
I guess csh or something.

4113
02:05:18,420 --> 02:05:19,140
Anyway,

4114
02:05:19,140 --> 02:05:20,490
it is profound.

4115
02:05:21,180 --> 02:05:24,180
The savings going direct to farmers,

4116
02:05:24,220 --> 02:05:25,020
uh,

4117
02:05:25,020 --> 02:05:25,853
can create.

4118
02:05:26,130 --> 02:05:29,100
It's amazing and buying volume and,

4119
02:05:29,101 --> 02:05:29,934
um,

4120
02:05:30,160 --> 02:05:30,410
you know,

4121
02:05:30,410 --> 02:05:31,200
and taking,

4122
02:05:31,200 --> 02:05:32,550
taking the middleman out of it.

4123
02:05:32,610 --> 02:05:33,443
That's the thing.

4124
02:05:33,650 --> 02:05:38,650
Is it possible with your methods and
the way that you're describing a farming

4125
02:05:38,841 --> 02:05:40,490
and what you've done with your farm,

4126
02:05:40,520 --> 02:05:42,950
is it possible to feed this
entire country that way?

4127
02:05:43,340 --> 02:05:43,790
Oh,

4128
02:05:43,790 --> 02:05:44,451
no question.

4129
02:05:44,451 --> 02:05:45,280
Not only is it,

4130
02:05:45,280 --> 02:05:46,310
is it possible?

4131
02:05:46,460 --> 02:05:51,460
It's actually the only regenerative way
to do it because when you break apart

4132
02:05:53,230 --> 02:05:53,990
the,

4133
02:05:53,990 --> 02:05:56,450
when you break apart the
feed from the animal,

4134
02:05:56,451 --> 02:05:57,410
from the manure,

4135
02:05:58,580 --> 02:06:01,910
and we could even include people in
that as well when you break all those,

4136
02:06:02,240 --> 02:06:02,630
those,

4137
02:06:02,630 --> 02:06:07,630
those that are supposed to
be a synergistic blessings
when you break them apart,

4138
02:06:10,940 --> 02:06:14,390
the whole thing floats on a counterfeit,

4139
02:06:14,990 --> 02:06:15,890
cheap energy,

4140
02:06:16,490 --> 02:06:17,360
cheap oil

4141
02:06:18,860 --> 02:06:19,693
and um,

4142
02:06:20,300 --> 02:06:21,133
and uh,

4143
02:06:21,150 --> 02:06:24,950
a fragile house of cards that depends on,

4144
02:06:25,360 --> 02:06:26,193
you know,

4145
02:06:26,240 --> 02:06:28,110
clever pharmaceuticals staying,

4146
02:06:28,230 --> 02:06:28,700
you know,

4147
02:06:28,700 --> 02:06:30,440
one mutation ahead of the,

4148
02:06:30,800 --> 02:06:32,950
of the mutating bugs to,

4149
02:06:33,110 --> 02:06:33,390
to,

4150
02:06:33,390 --> 02:06:33,700
to,

4151
02:06:33,700 --> 02:06:34,533
to function.

4152
02:06:34,550 --> 02:06:39,550
So the argument against what you're
prescribing in describing is that what you

4153
02:06:40,041 --> 02:06:42,970
have is sort of a,

4154
02:06:43,010 --> 02:06:43,570
a,

4155
02:06:43,570 --> 02:06:48,570
a beautiful small business model for
creating a very ethical farm and raising

4156
02:06:51,591 --> 02:06:52,970
animals in a very nice way,

4157
02:06:52,971 --> 02:06:56,720
but it's impractical when you're talking
about feeding a nation of 300 million

4158
02:06:56,721 --> 02:06:57,350
people,

4159
02:06:57,350 --> 02:06:57,950
but when,

4160
02:06:57,950 --> 02:07:02,950
but you're saying that not just the fact
that you factor in when you farm your

4161
02:07:04,751 --> 02:07:05,230
way,

4162
02:07:05,230 --> 02:07:10,230
the lack of sort of invisible costs
that you get with factory farming,

4163
02:07:11,230 --> 02:07:15,400
the lack of all the other factors that
you have to bring in like chemicals and

4164
02:07:15,460 --> 02:07:19,150
antibiotics and all these different things
that are just unnecessary completely.

4165
02:07:19,151 --> 02:07:21,550
But the actual volume of food,

4166
02:07:21,700 --> 02:07:22,420
the actual,

4167
02:07:22,420 --> 02:07:23,200
all you have a food.

4168
02:07:23,200 --> 02:07:23,771
Absolutely.

4169
02:07:23,771 --> 02:07:28,330
The actual volume of food
is more in symbiotic places.

4170
02:07:28,500 --> 02:07:28,681
Let,

4171
02:07:28,681 --> 02:07:29,020
let me,

4172
02:07:29,020 --> 02:07:29,261
uh,

4173
02:07:29,261 --> 02:07:29,950
and,

4174
02:07:29,950 --> 02:07:30,280
and,

4175
02:07:30,280 --> 02:07:35,110
and are kind of farming with portable
infrastructure allows you to use nooks and

4176
02:07:35,111 --> 02:07:37,120
crannies that currently aren't being used.

4177
02:07:37,270 --> 02:07:38,350
Let me give you an example.

4178
02:07:38,860 --> 02:07:40,750
Let's take pigs as an example.

4179
02:07:41,800 --> 02:07:43,240
We run pigs in the,

4180
02:07:43,300 --> 02:07:44,133
in the woods,

4181
02:07:44,350 --> 02:07:48,400
and they eat acorns and bugs and weeds
and things like that through the woods.

4182
02:07:49,360 --> 02:07:52,450
And they actually eat the bugs that would
attack the trees in the woods of the

4183
02:07:52,451 --> 02:07:53,320
trees are healthier.

4184
02:07:54,760 --> 02:07:59,760
The fact is that we have millions
and millions of acres of unused land.

4185
02:08:04,180 --> 02:08:08,800
There's not one reason for a single
confinement hog facility in the entire

4186
02:08:08,801 --> 02:08:09,634
country.

4187
02:08:10,810 --> 02:08:15,810
If we used our national forests
are bureau land management,

4188
02:08:16,470 --> 02:08:17,080
you know,

4189
02:08:17,080 --> 02:08:19,030
pinyon pine in Colorado,

4190
02:08:19,031 --> 02:08:20,950
if we use mesquite in Texas,

4191
02:08:21,310 --> 02:08:21,940
um,

4192
02:08:21,940 --> 02:08:22,773
you know,

4193
02:08:23,320 --> 02:08:25,070
appalachian hardwoods in,

4194
02:08:25,430 --> 02:08:30,430
in the mid atlantic and south every place
has millions of acres where these pigs

4195
02:08:34,901 --> 02:08:37,990
could be run and it does.

4196
02:08:38,710 --> 02:08:41,710
And you simply vacate the houses.

4197
02:08:42,190 --> 02:08:42,970
So,

4198
02:08:42,970 --> 02:08:43,803
um,

4199
02:08:43,810 --> 02:08:44,720
so the,

4200
02:08:44,820 --> 02:08:46,540
the truth is we are,

4201
02:08:46,720 --> 02:08:49,210
we are not beginning to leverage.

4202
02:08:49,690 --> 02:08:52,750
We're not beginning to leverage
the resource base that we have.

4203
02:08:52,890 --> 02:08:56,160
So when you're talking about is
the resources that are untouched?

4204
02:08:56,220 --> 02:08:56,581
Yes.

4205
02:08:56,581 --> 02:08:59,670
So the factory farm system that we have,

4206
02:09:00,090 --> 02:09:03,270
the amount of food that they produce
in order to produce that same amount of

4207
02:09:03,271 --> 02:09:03,691
fruit,

4208
02:09:03,691 --> 02:09:05,340
we would have to use more land.

4209
02:09:05,490 --> 02:09:08,250
We would have to use more
areas that we're not using now.

4210
02:09:08,370 --> 02:09:09,300
We would have to.

4211
02:09:09,380 --> 02:09:09,501
Yeah.

4212
02:09:09,501 --> 02:09:10,850
But it would be good land use.

4213
02:09:10,970 --> 02:09:11,803
It's not,

4214
02:09:11,960 --> 02:09:15,080
it's not harmful land use,

4215
02:09:15,740 --> 02:09:16,281
I understand,

4216
02:09:16,281 --> 02:09:21,281
but that land is most likely either owned
by the state national wildlife problem

4217
02:09:22,190 --> 02:09:22,590
too.

4218
02:09:22,590 --> 02:09:22,810
Well,

4219
02:09:22,810 --> 02:09:23,121
yeah.

4220
02:09:23,121 --> 02:09:26,420
And then the other problem would
be where would the profit be?

4221
02:09:26,421 --> 02:09:30,170
Who would profit than if you're talking
about national forests and you're

4222
02:09:30,171 --> 02:09:32,840
talking about a private company
that grows agricultural,

4223
02:09:32,900 --> 02:09:37,900
gross farm animals in these natural forest
who would be able to decide who gets

4224
02:09:38,991 --> 02:09:40,220
to use their animals.

4225
02:09:40,221 --> 02:09:40,850
And this.

4226
02:09:40,850 --> 02:09:41,390
Right.

4227
02:09:41,390 --> 02:09:41,661
Well,

4228
02:09:41,661 --> 02:09:41,950
when,

4229
02:09:41,950 --> 02:09:42,111
uh,

4230
02:09:42,111 --> 02:09:46,520
when governor tim kaine came to visit our
farm toward the end of his governance,

4231
02:09:46,580 --> 02:09:50,120
the gubernatorial time in Virginia,

4232
02:09:50,640 --> 02:09:51,473
um,

4233
02:09:51,500 --> 02:09:52,370
he really got it.

4234
02:09:52,371 --> 02:09:52,551
I mean,

4235
02:09:52,551 --> 02:09:53,210
we went,

4236
02:09:53,210 --> 02:09:53,720
we went,

4237
02:09:53,720 --> 02:09:54,411
did all this,

4238
02:09:54,411 --> 02:09:54,590
you know,

4239
02:09:54,590 --> 02:09:56,190
saw this and he,

4240
02:09:56,191 --> 02:09:56,691
he totally,

4241
02:09:56,691 --> 02:09:57,680
he totally bought into it.

4242
02:09:57,681 --> 02:09:57,981
He said,

4243
02:09:57,981 --> 02:09:58,750
so,

4244
02:09:58,750 --> 02:09:59,583
um,

4245
02:10:00,080 --> 02:10:00,620
you know,

4246
02:10:00,620 --> 02:10:01,453
what,

4247
02:10:01,790 --> 02:10:02,421
what can I,

4248
02:10:02,421 --> 02:10:03,051
do you know,

4249
02:10:03,051 --> 02:10:03,320
what,

4250
02:10:03,320 --> 02:10:04,280
what's the next step?

4251
02:10:04,460 --> 02:10:04,731
I said,

4252
02:10:04,731 --> 02:10:04,941
well,

4253
02:10:04,941 --> 02:10:05,271
governor,

4254
02:10:05,271 --> 02:10:06,104
I said,

4255
02:10:06,230 --> 02:10:07,940
let's have a meeting next week at the,

4256
02:10:08,030 --> 02:10:08,360
at,

4257
02:10:08,360 --> 02:10:13,360
at the governor's mansion and iron out
a lease arrangement where polyface can,

4258
02:10:14,210 --> 02:10:18,110
can run pigs in the state forests
and keep all the trees from dying.

4259
02:10:20,670 --> 02:10:21,031
And of course,

4260
02:10:21,031 --> 02:10:21,241
you know,

4261
02:10:21,241 --> 02:10:23,430
he smiled and he knew,

4262
02:10:23,520 --> 02:10:28,520
he knew sarah burley that I was exactly
right because the appalachian hardwood

4263
02:10:29,041 --> 02:10:34,041
forests are dying and they're
due to lack of disturbance,

4264
02:10:34,730 --> 02:10:36,560
lack of disturbance in our ecosystem.

4265
02:10:36,561 --> 02:10:37,550
We don't have the buFfalo,

4266
02:10:37,551 --> 02:10:39,080
we don't have the fires anymore,

4267
02:10:39,290 --> 02:10:43,550
so they're dying due to
lack of disturbance so we
can absolutely bring those

4268
02:10:43,551 --> 02:10:45,260
forest back to vibrancy.

4269
02:10:47,600 --> 02:10:48,920
Right now they're just sterile,

4270
02:10:49,070 --> 02:10:49,903
they're just,

4271
02:10:50,140 --> 02:10:54,220
they're just sitting there so they
could be disturbed by these disturbance.

4272
02:10:54,710 --> 02:10:55,340
And so,

4273
02:10:55,340 --> 02:10:56,870
so his,

4274
02:10:57,020 --> 02:10:59,570
his understanding of ecology,

4275
02:11:01,530 --> 02:11:02,580
absolutely.

4276
02:11:02,880 --> 02:11:07,880
I'm mandated that he get
his head around this idea.

4277
02:11:08,130 --> 02:11:11,100
But of course he grinned and
laughed at and we both realized,

4278
02:11:11,280 --> 02:11:11,521
I mean,

4279
02:11:11,521 --> 02:11:15,350
can you imagine what the radical
environmental groups would do if you said,

4280
02:11:15,360 --> 02:11:20,360
we're going to start leasing some of the
state parks so people can grow pigs in

4281
02:11:21,001 --> 02:11:21,834
them?

4282
02:11:21,870 --> 02:11:22,200
I mean,

4283
02:11:22,200 --> 02:11:23,033
it would be.

4284
02:11:23,600 --> 02:11:23,781
Well,

4285
02:11:23,781 --> 02:11:25,160
I mean it's unspeakable.

4286
02:11:25,250 --> 02:11:25,410
Well,

4287
02:11:25,410 --> 02:11:25,900
let's

4288
02:11:25,900 --> 02:11:29,950
forget about their arguments against an
environmental groups or peta or anybody

4289
02:11:29,951 --> 02:11:31,300
who might have an argument against it.

4290
02:11:31,510 --> 02:11:33,550
If you have a clean slate,

4291
02:11:33,580 --> 02:11:35,350
and if it was your job,

4292
02:11:35,530 --> 02:11:38,200
you could design the,

4293
02:11:38,201 --> 02:11:38,950
uh,

4294
02:11:38,950 --> 02:11:42,940
the whole agricultural system
of this country to feed America.

4295
02:11:42,941 --> 02:11:43,480
Yes.

4296
02:11:43,480 --> 02:11:45,320
Based on your principles,

4297
02:11:46,120 --> 02:11:46,720
easy.

4298
02:11:46,720 --> 02:11:46,960
No,

4299
02:11:46,960 --> 02:11:47,740
no question.

4300
02:11:47,740 --> 02:11:52,740
But we would have to use a lot of the
land that's currently state land or

4301
02:11:52,901 --> 02:11:54,010
national forest.

4302
02:11:54,630 --> 02:11:59,630
Do you know that right now the
us has 700 registered dead zones,

4303
02:12:00,780 --> 02:12:01,081
right?

4304
02:12:01,081 --> 02:12:02,400
Perry dead zones.

4305
02:12:02,790 --> 02:12:05,700
One is the size of New
Jersey in the gulf of Mexico.

4306
02:12:06,150 --> 02:12:09,120
Those dead zones are collateral.

4307
02:12:09,230 --> 02:12:10,440
They are now.

4308
02:12:10,560 --> 02:12:13,320
They are now inhospitable to life.

4309
02:12:13,350 --> 02:12:13,471
I mean,

4310
02:12:13,471 --> 02:12:13,831
that's the,

4311
02:12:13,831 --> 02:12:15,810
that's the definition of a dead zone.

4312
02:12:16,150 --> 02:12:16,650
They are,

4313
02:12:16,650 --> 02:12:20,550
they were once productive areas,

4314
02:12:20,551 --> 02:12:20,790
you know,

4315
02:12:20,790 --> 02:12:23,040
fisheries and amphibians,

4316
02:12:23,041 --> 02:12:23,310
you know,

4317
02:12:23,310 --> 02:12:27,420
productive areas that are
now inhospitable to life.

4318
02:12:31,850 --> 02:12:36,850
They are a direct result of overrunning
our nests ability to handle our,

4319
02:12:44,180 --> 02:12:45,013
um,

4320
02:12:45,770 --> 02:12:47,510
our mechanistic creativity.

4321
02:12:48,830 --> 02:12:52,340
And so the fact is that in North Carolina,

4322
02:12:52,341 --> 02:12:54,350
which leads the state in hog production,

4323
02:12:54,800 --> 02:12:59,800
if you didn't have a hurricane every two
years to flush all the manure lagoons

4324
02:13:00,020 --> 02:13:00,980
out to the ocean,

4325
02:13:02,420 --> 02:13:06,350
North Carolina would now
be buried in hog manure.

4326
02:13:06,920 --> 02:13:07,850
That's the truth.

4327
02:13:08,390 --> 02:13:09,700
And so fortunately we,

4328
02:13:09,830 --> 02:13:10,700
fortunately,

4329
02:13:10,730 --> 02:13:11,270
you know,

4330
02:13:11,270 --> 02:13:13,130
we get a hurricane every couple of years,

4331
02:13:13,430 --> 02:13:14,870
tough flush North Carolina,

4332
02:13:14,871 --> 02:13:15,830
like a big toilet,

4333
02:13:16,010 --> 02:13:16,843
so it doesn't,

4334
02:13:16,900 --> 02:13:17,300
you know,

4335
02:13:17,300 --> 02:13:18,620
choke on its own waste.

4336
02:13:18,890 --> 02:13:19,700
Wow.

4337
02:13:19,700 --> 02:13:20,330
So,

4338
02:13:20,330 --> 02:13:20,740
so,

4339
02:13:20,740 --> 02:13:21,573
you know,

4340
02:13:22,400 --> 02:13:23,590
so The idea,

4341
02:13:23,690 --> 02:13:25,460
whose land are we using here?

4342
02:13:25,970 --> 02:13:27,170
Let's talk to the,

4343
02:13:27,380 --> 02:13:32,280
let's talk to the displaced a shrimp
fishermen in the gulf of Mexico and talk

4344
02:13:32,281 --> 02:13:33,270
about displacement.

4345
02:13:33,480 --> 02:13:34,770
Let's talk about land use.

4346
02:13:34,840 --> 02:13:38,520
Are you with me when we start
talking about the whole,

4347
02:13:38,540 --> 02:13:38,630
the,

4348
02:13:38,630 --> 02:13:39,450
the whole,

4349
02:13:39,450 --> 02:13:39,760
uh,

4350
02:13:39,760 --> 02:13:40,320
um,

4351
02:13:40,320 --> 02:13:41,430
land use issue.

4352
02:13:42,210 --> 02:13:46,170
Our system actually actually

4353
02:13:47,760 --> 02:13:51,150
would eliminate all of this dead zone,

4354
02:13:51,180 --> 02:13:52,830
all of this inhospitable,

4355
02:13:52,980 --> 02:13:54,300
the desertification,

4356
02:13:54,600 --> 02:13:56,280
all the collateral damage.

4357
02:13:56,640 --> 02:14:01,640
We would actually have far more productive
land than we do today because we're,

4358
02:14:02,681 --> 02:14:05,280
we're toxifying a very small part.

4359
02:14:06,270 --> 02:14:07,103
And,

4360
02:14:07,860 --> 02:14:08,340
and,

4361
02:14:08,340 --> 02:14:08,790
and,

4362
02:14:08,790 --> 02:14:09,623
um,

4363
02:14:09,900 --> 02:14:10,733
what,

4364
02:14:10,910 --> 02:14:15,910
you know that that toxic stream
is killing a bunch of other land.

4365
02:14:19,410 --> 02:14:21,480
Why don't we just be honest and say,

4366
02:14:22,320 --> 02:14:27,320
let's use It all in a healing fashion
and we will have any dead zones and it'll

4367
02:14:27,841 --> 02:14:28,510
all be,

4368
02:14:28,510 --> 02:14:29,080
uh,

4369
02:14:29,080 --> 02:14:29,520
you know,

4370
02:14:29,520 --> 02:14:30,660
progressively healing.

4371
02:14:30,930 --> 02:14:32,760
that sounds like a
better alternative to me.

4372
02:14:32,790 --> 02:14:33,840
So the only way to have

4373
02:14:33,870 --> 02:14:35,250
these healthy environments,

4374
02:14:35,251 --> 02:14:36,810
these healthy growIng environments,

4375
02:14:36,811 --> 02:14:41,130
is to have sort of a symbiotic
relationship with all the
various different types

4376
02:14:41,131 --> 02:14:43,820
of animals and the various
different types of plants.

4377
02:14:43,980 --> 02:14:48,980
Is it possible to have acres and acres
of things like corn and wheat without

4378
02:14:49,140 --> 02:14:53,880
animals roaming free and still have
some sort of a healthy environment?

4379
02:14:53,881 --> 02:14:54,150
I mean,

4380
02:14:54,150 --> 02:14:59,150
can you grow a thousand acres of corn
in a healthy way without having animals

4381
02:15:01,681 --> 02:15:02,514
and the environment?

4382
02:15:04,090 --> 02:15:04,923
Um,

4383
02:15:05,410 --> 02:15:07,330
probably the short answer is no,

4384
02:15:07,840 --> 02:15:09,700
but if you.

4385
02:15:09,730 --> 02:15:10,060
But,

4386
02:15:10,060 --> 02:15:12,130
but that doesn't mean
you can't grow grain.

4387
02:15:12,190 --> 02:15:12,461
I mean,

4388
02:15:12,461 --> 02:15:13,300
there are now,

4389
02:15:13,630 --> 02:15:13,961
uh,

4390
02:15:13,961 --> 02:15:14,890
in Australia,

4391
02:15:14,920 --> 02:15:15,580
um,

4392
02:15:15,580 --> 02:15:20,580
they're really colin seis there who has
visited a term called pasture cropping,

4393
02:15:21,430 --> 02:15:21,641
uh,

4394
02:15:21,641 --> 02:15:26,230
has developed infrastructure and protocols
for where you grow grain in perennial

4395
02:15:26,231 --> 02:15:27,064
pasture,

4396
02:15:27,220 --> 02:15:27,580
uh,

4397
02:15:27,580 --> 02:15:28,151
without,

4398
02:15:28,151 --> 02:15:29,350
without much tillage.

4399
02:15:29,710 --> 02:15:30,580
So you don't,

4400
02:15:30,640 --> 02:15:33,250
you don't till the,

4401
02:15:33,251 --> 02:15:33,561
uh,

4402
02:15:33,561 --> 02:15:34,331
the Blanket,

4403
02:15:34,331 --> 02:15:37,720
you don't till the vegetative
blanket of the soil.

4404
02:15:37,990 --> 02:15:41,200
Instead you use livestock as a,

4405
02:15:41,470 --> 02:15:46,470
as a pruner to prepare a
and even temporarily weaken
the perennial grass plant

4406
02:15:50,471 --> 02:15:51,430
right into it.

4407
02:15:52,300 --> 02:15:53,133
The annuals,

4408
02:15:53,350 --> 02:15:53,831
barley,

4409
02:15:53,831 --> 02:15:54,131
wheat,

4410
02:15:54,131 --> 02:15:54,431
rye,

4411
02:15:54,431 --> 02:15:54,940
whatever,

4412
02:15:54,940 --> 02:15:56,020
and it grows.

4413
02:15:56,021 --> 02:15:57,280
Beats out the grass,

4414
02:15:57,670 --> 02:15:58,690
the grass days,

4415
02:15:58,720 --> 02:16:03,720
subordinated it in the shadow so
that when the grain dries down,

4416
02:16:03,820 --> 02:16:06,250
you harvest the grain and
you've already got a nice,

4417
02:16:07,120 --> 02:16:07,570
you Know,

4418
02:16:07,570 --> 02:16:11,580
a regrowth of a green
material underneath with,

4419
02:16:11,740 --> 02:16:14,590
without ever actually destroying the sod.

4420
02:16:15,280 --> 02:16:15,821
And uh,

4421
02:16:15,821 --> 02:16:16,810
that's been there now,

4422
02:16:16,811 --> 02:16:19,000
2000 farmers in Australia doing this.

4423
02:16:19,001 --> 02:16:20,470
It's jumping now to the us.

4424
02:16:21,040 --> 02:16:26,040
It's a real hot technology and it works.

4425
02:16:27,070 --> 02:16:27,730
So,

4426
02:16:27,730 --> 02:16:28,563
you know,

4427
02:16:28,880 --> 02:16:30,490
there are a lot of pieces to this.

4428
02:16:31,120 --> 02:16:31,960
First of all,

4429
02:16:32,320 --> 02:16:34,510
if you quit feeding herbivores grain,

4430
02:16:35,260 --> 02:16:38,440
you tremendously reduce the amount
of grain it has to be produced.

4431
02:16:38,860 --> 02:16:40,420
Then you go to a very good point.

4432
02:16:40,510 --> 02:16:41,051
That's a very,

4433
02:16:41,051 --> 02:16:41,880
very good point.

4434
02:16:41,880 --> 02:16:44,380
Then you go to a perennial and,

4435
02:16:44,440 --> 02:16:44,820
and uh,

4436
02:16:44,820 --> 02:16:45,280
you know,

4437
02:16:45,280 --> 02:16:48,010
at the top of the program we talked
about these principles of nature,

4438
02:16:48,011 --> 02:16:48,191
you know,

4439
02:16:48,191 --> 02:16:49,450
one is animals move,

4440
02:16:49,660 --> 02:16:51,400
another is that nature.

4441
02:16:51,900 --> 02:16:53,530
A natUre likes perennials.

4442
02:16:53,560 --> 02:16:55,270
Nature has very few annuals.

4443
02:16:55,271 --> 02:16:56,104
Actually,

4444
02:16:56,650 --> 02:16:58,100
nature thrives on perennials.

4445
02:16:58,101 --> 02:16:59,000
So a,

4446
02:16:59,040 --> 02:17:04,040
a productive regenerative food system
should be concentrated on perennials,

4447
02:17:05,050 --> 02:17:05,883
not annual.

4448
02:17:05,890 --> 02:17:08,380
So describe to people that don't know
what the difference between those

4449
02:17:08,650 --> 02:17:09,990
perennial is a plant,

4450
02:17:10,030 --> 02:17:11,530
you don't have to plant every year.

4451
02:17:11,590 --> 02:17:13,170
An annual is a plan.

4452
02:17:13,210 --> 02:17:14,410
You have to plan annually.

4453
02:17:14,680 --> 02:17:15,071
Okay.

4454
02:17:15,071 --> 02:17:15,820
Every year.

4455
02:17:15,820 --> 02:17:16,450
So,

4456
02:17:16,450 --> 02:17:17,650
so grains,

4457
02:17:17,990 --> 02:17:18,610
um,

4458
02:17:18,610 --> 02:17:19,720
squash plants,

4459
02:17:20,630 --> 02:17:21,940
your garden vegetables,

4460
02:17:22,150 --> 02:17:23,110
those are annuals.

4461
02:17:24,090 --> 02:17:25,720
Blackberries are perennials,

4462
02:17:25,870 --> 02:17:26,090
you know,

4463
02:17:26,090 --> 02:17:29,470
you plant them once you
trees are perennials,

4464
02:17:29,860 --> 02:17:30,491
vines,

4465
02:17:30,491 --> 02:17:31,324
bushes,

4466
02:17:31,360 --> 02:17:32,350
grasses.

4467
02:17:32,770 --> 02:17:33,603
Okay.

4468
02:17:33,670 --> 02:17:34,960
those are all perennials.

4469
02:17:35,500 --> 02:17:38,530
And so that is the basis of the,

4470
02:17:38,650 --> 02:17:40,510
of nature's ecology is perennials.

4471
02:17:40,511 --> 02:17:41,344
Not annuals.

4472
02:17:41,530 --> 02:17:46,530
Realized that our ag policy in
the United States is to subsidize,

4473
02:17:47,410 --> 02:17:48,520
not perennials,

4474
02:17:48,820 --> 02:17:49,660
but annuals.

4475
02:17:49,720 --> 02:17:50,553
Six of them,

4476
02:17:50,640 --> 02:17:51,040
you know,

4477
02:17:51,040 --> 02:17:52,060
we corn,

4478
02:17:52,120 --> 02:17:52,953
soybeans,

4479
02:17:53,260 --> 02:17:54,093
cotton,

4480
02:17:54,520 --> 02:17:56,140
sugar and rice,

4481
02:17:56,650 --> 02:17:58,030
all of those are annuals.

4482
02:17:58,210 --> 02:18:03,210
So our official ag incentivization
is to incentivize the very thing that

4483
02:18:04,781 --> 02:18:05,620
destroys soil.

4484
02:18:06,340 --> 02:18:07,210
That's hilarious.

4485
02:18:08,280 --> 02:18:12,890
And it's also hilarious that we insist
on feeding animals grains just to get

4486
02:18:12,891 --> 02:18:13,640
them fatter.

4487
02:18:13,640 --> 02:18:14,120
Right?

4488
02:18:14,120 --> 02:18:14,781
And you know,

4489
02:18:14,781 --> 02:18:16,460
that fat being an unhealthy fat.

4490
02:18:16,461 --> 02:18:20,240
I am amazed every time I go to a nice
restaurant and they try to offer me that

4491
02:18:20,241 --> 02:18:21,260
coby beef stuff.

4492
02:18:21,320 --> 02:18:21,850
Oh yeah.

4493
02:18:21,850 --> 02:18:22,071
I'm like,

4494
02:18:22,071 --> 02:18:22,191
well,

4495
02:18:22,191 --> 02:18:25,670
you'd get away from me with
that sick cow thing is sick.

4496
02:18:25,720 --> 02:18:25,931
Oh,

4497
02:18:25,931 --> 02:18:27,920
it's so it's wonderfully marbled.

4498
02:18:27,960 --> 02:18:28,491
No,

4499
02:18:28,491 --> 02:18:29,600
that thing's dying.

4500
02:18:29,930 --> 02:18:31,760
Things barely alive when you shoot it.

4501
02:18:31,840 --> 02:18:32,220
Yeah,

4502
02:18:32,220 --> 02:18:32,760
that's right.

4503
02:18:32,760 --> 02:18:34,680
The liver livers probably swollen up.

4504
02:18:34,980 --> 02:18:39,600
So the point is that if we
quit feeding herbivores grain,

4505
02:18:39,601 --> 02:18:39,900
we would,

4506
02:18:39,900 --> 02:18:42,660
we would grow way less than
if we take the omnivores,

4507
02:18:42,661 --> 02:18:46,860
the pigs and the chickens and
integrate them as salvagers.

4508
02:18:47,760 --> 02:18:48,593
Like

4509
02:18:49,680 --> 02:18:50,513
listen,

4510
02:18:50,550 --> 02:18:53,850
if every kitchen had
enough chickens to eat,

4511
02:18:53,851 --> 02:18:55,020
it's kitchen scraps.

4512
02:18:55,320 --> 02:18:55,711
I mean,

4513
02:18:55,711 --> 02:18:55,861
you know,

4514
02:18:55,861 --> 02:18:58,200
like get rid of the pet dog
and put it into two chickens.

4515
02:18:58,201 --> 02:18:58,680
Right.

4516
02:18:58,680 --> 02:18:59,160
Okay.

4517
02:18:59,160 --> 02:19:03,600
If every kitchen had enough
chickens to eat the kitchen scraps,

4518
02:19:03,660 --> 02:19:07,530
there would not be an
egg industry in the us.

4519
02:19:08,260 --> 02:19:09,093
Not one.

4520
02:19:10,020 --> 02:19:10,620
Okay.

4521
02:19:10,620 --> 02:19:12,240
This was the role of chickens.

4522
02:19:12,450 --> 02:19:14,430
What we do instead is we,

4523
02:19:14,750 --> 02:19:15,780
we send our,

4524
02:19:15,870 --> 02:19:19,470
our kitchen waste down the
disposal or out in the garbage.

4525
02:19:19,471 --> 02:19:24,471
It goes to the landfill and the
whole ecosystem is deprived of the,

4526
02:19:25,610 --> 02:19:30,610
of the biomass that's to compost or
digest and feed the next cycle of life.

4527
02:19:32,840 --> 02:19:33,341
The problem is,

4528
02:19:33,341 --> 02:19:35,480
is really tough to keep two
chickens in an apartment,

4529
02:19:36,350 --> 02:19:36,720
eh?

4530
02:19:36,720 --> 02:19:38,310
They don't take any more
room than a quarter.

4531
02:19:38,380 --> 02:19:41,120
Then an aquarium or a durable to chickens?

4532
02:19:41,121 --> 02:19:41,570
Yeah.

4533
02:19:41,570 --> 02:19:43,520
well they gotta rhonda
wouldn't the whole idea.

4534
02:19:43,521 --> 02:19:44,720
They have to wander around.

4535
02:19:45,850 --> 02:19:47,360
They don't need a lot of growth room.

4536
02:19:47,361 --> 02:19:47,980
I mean if you,

4537
02:19:47,980 --> 02:19:48,920
if you had them,

4538
02:19:48,940 --> 02:19:49,590
uh,

4539
02:19:49,590 --> 02:19:50,000
uh,

4540
02:19:50,000 --> 02:19:53,060
three feet by two feet would
be fine for two chickens.

4541
02:19:53,150 --> 02:19:53,721
Really?

4542
02:19:53,721 --> 02:19:54,141
Yeah.

4543
02:19:54,141 --> 02:19:54,890
Oh yeah.

4544
02:19:54,890 --> 02:19:55,420
Yeah.

4545
02:19:55,420 --> 02:19:57,320
But what about foraging
and all that good stuff.

4546
02:19:58,700 --> 02:19:59,391
Just just,

4547
02:19:59,391 --> 02:20:00,020
um,

4548
02:20:00,020 --> 02:20:00,261
just,

4549
02:20:00,261 --> 02:20:00,620
you know,

4550
02:20:00,620 --> 02:20:00,981
built,

4551
02:20:00,981 --> 02:20:02,060
build your box,

4552
02:20:02,090 --> 02:20:04,370
your container so that they can,

4553
02:20:04,371 --> 02:20:05,170
um,

4554
02:20:05,170 --> 02:20:05,590
you know,

4555
02:20:05,590 --> 02:20:10,590
so that they can get to about 12 inches
of compost underneath them and you just

4556
02:20:10,731 --> 02:20:12,100
throw your scraps in there and they.

4557
02:20:12,180 --> 02:20:13,340
And in the compost,

4558
02:20:13,540 --> 02:20:14,120
you know,

4559
02:20:14,120 --> 02:20:15,740
feed your little pot garden.

4560
02:20:16,330 --> 02:20:16,910
I mean,

4561
02:20:16,910 --> 02:20:17,390
well,

4562
02:20:17,390 --> 02:20:17,601
you know,

4563
02:20:17,601 --> 02:20:19,100
whatever kind of pot garden you have,

4564
02:20:19,101 --> 02:20:19,221
you know,

4565
02:20:19,221 --> 02:20:20,140
container gardens,

4566
02:20:20,300 --> 02:20:21,110
containers,

4567
02:20:21,110 --> 02:20:21,690
containers yet.

4568
02:20:21,690 --> 02:20:21,860
but,

4569
02:20:21,860 --> 02:20:23,330
but I'm happy with pop gardens too.

4570
02:20:23,540 --> 02:20:26,000
I mean take that whichever
way you want to do it.

4571
02:20:26,090 --> 02:20:26,690
All right.

4572
02:20:26,690 --> 02:20:27,380
Anyway,

4573
02:20:27,380 --> 02:20:28,370
that becomes,

4574
02:20:28,610 --> 02:20:29,730
that becomes your,

4575
02:20:30,900 --> 02:20:31,240
you know,

4576
02:20:31,240 --> 02:20:31,511
your,

4577
02:20:31,511 --> 02:20:33,860
your fertilizer for your house.

4578
02:20:34,070 --> 02:20:38,060
And what you do then is you turn your
house instead of an ecological liability.

4579
02:20:38,240 --> 02:20:43,240
Your house becomes an integrated
part of an ecosystem asset.

4580
02:20:43,990 --> 02:20:44,141
Well,

4581
02:20:44,141 --> 02:20:46,450
it seems that in in that sense,

4582
02:20:46,451 --> 02:20:50,380
that giant cities like New York where
people are stacked on top of each other,

4583
02:20:50,550 --> 02:20:52,390
they essentially a factory farming humans.

4584
02:20:52,860 --> 02:20:53,460
Yeah,

4585
02:20:53,460 --> 02:20:54,293
that's right.

4586
02:20:54,390 --> 02:20:54,811
That's right.

4587
02:20:54,811 --> 02:20:55,620
They are a.

4588
02:20:55,620 --> 02:20:56,160
But there's.

4589
02:20:56,160 --> 02:21:00,360
There are a lot of these
cool ways now that we can.

4590
02:21:00,410 --> 02:21:00,620
You know,

4591
02:21:00,620 --> 02:21:01,620
we can do it anyway.

4592
02:21:01,740 --> 02:21:06,000
If you take the pig and the chicken and
you use them as their salvage operation,

4593
02:21:06,240 --> 02:21:07,980
then you cut even more grain,

4594
02:21:08,550 --> 02:21:10,740
so you take off the herbivore grain,

4595
02:21:10,741 --> 02:21:14,670
you take off the the chicken
grain and the pig grain.

4596
02:21:14,671 --> 02:21:15,504
Suddenly

4597
02:21:16,860 --> 02:21:20,780
you don't have much grain use and
when you don't need very much grain,

4598
02:21:20,790 --> 02:21:22,020
you don't have to plow very much.

4599
02:21:22,021 --> 02:21:23,280
You don't have to plow very much.

4600
02:21:23,730 --> 02:21:27,690
Then you can go back to a perennially
based system and you can go back to the

4601
02:21:27,691 --> 02:21:32,691
historic rotations were several years of
perennials built the fertility for the

4602
02:21:35,341 --> 02:21:37,950
one or two years of annual extraction.

4603
02:21:39,090 --> 02:21:39,923
Okay,

4604
02:21:40,290 --> 02:21:45,290
now now you're on to a regenerating an
actual healing soil building system.

4605
02:21:46,800 --> 02:21:47,633
So what you're

4606
02:21:48,030 --> 02:21:53,030
bing or describing in fact is the
way that our culture should have been

4607
02:21:53,041 --> 02:21:54,510
engineered in the first place.

4608
02:21:55,740 --> 02:22:00,740
But a lot of what we have here is sort
of the momentum of the past that we have

4609
02:22:03,661 --> 02:22:07,830
to deal with the momentum of this factory
farm establishment that was set up

4610
02:22:07,831 --> 02:22:11,400
that's been providing us with food
for decades upon decades upon decades.

4611
02:22:11,580 --> 02:22:12,690
Almost a century now.

4612
02:22:12,950 --> 02:22:13,460
Yeah.

4613
02:22:13,460 --> 02:22:16,190
And you have to understand in context,

4614
02:22:16,550 --> 02:22:19,720
don't be too hard on the
ancestors because it what,

4615
02:22:19,790 --> 02:22:22,010
what happened was it got easier.

4616
02:22:22,550 --> 02:22:24,920
It got easier to grow

4617
02:22:27,000 --> 02:22:27,833
and feed it.

4618
02:22:28,470 --> 02:22:29,220
That was,

4619
02:22:29,220 --> 02:22:34,220
that came earlier than electric fence
and scientific composting systems.

4620
02:22:36,600 --> 02:22:41,600
So it was the electric fence
that allowed us to suddenly I'm,

4621
02:22:43,200 --> 02:22:44,820
I'm free,

4622
02:22:45,300 --> 02:22:50,300
free these animals from supposedly a
efficient confinement programs and grain

4623
02:22:52,561 --> 02:22:53,670
feeding programs.

4624
02:22:54,060 --> 02:22:54,891
It was the,

4625
02:22:54,891 --> 02:22:55,200
I mean,

4626
02:22:55,200 --> 02:22:56,730
George Washington at mount vernon,

4627
02:22:56,880 --> 02:22:58,650
he always complained about the pigs.

4628
02:22:58,651 --> 02:23:02,250
He was a very meticulous record keeper
and he always complained about the pigs

4629
02:23:02,251 --> 02:23:04,350
because he could never
get them all in at once,

4630
02:23:04,740 --> 02:23:05,191
you know,

4631
02:23:05,191 --> 02:23:08,340
because he just ran through the woods
and they had their babies and you know,

4632
02:23:08,341 --> 02:23:09,174
you kinda.

4633
02:23:09,180 --> 02:23:10,440
Well it's hog killing time.

4634
02:23:10,441 --> 02:23:10,931
It's fall,

4635
02:23:10,931 --> 02:23:11,190
you know,

4636
02:23:11,190 --> 02:23:12,240
let's get what we can.

4637
02:23:12,241 --> 02:23:12,541
And a,

4638
02:23:12,541 --> 02:23:14,220
they'd get what they
can never get them all.

4639
02:23:14,220 --> 02:23:16,530
So you never really knew,

4640
02:23:17,310 --> 02:23:17,540
you know,

4641
02:23:17,540 --> 02:23:17,730
for,

4642
02:23:17,730 --> 02:23:19,230
for a meticulous record keeper.

4643
02:23:19,231 --> 02:23:20,041
This was a nightmare,

4644
02:23:20,041 --> 02:23:20,271
right.

4645
02:23:20,271 --> 02:23:20,401
You know,

4646
02:23:20,401 --> 02:23:23,790
you never could count
all of his stock and um,

4647
02:23:24,050 --> 02:23:24,270
but,

4648
02:23:24,270 --> 02:23:25,680
but that's the way pigs were used.

4649
02:23:25,681 --> 02:23:26,610
Pigs were just kind of,

4650
02:23:26,611 --> 02:23:27,420
they were just,

4651
02:23:27,420 --> 02:23:28,380
they were salvagers,

4652
02:23:28,381 --> 02:23:30,240
they were kind of nook and cranny,

4653
02:23:30,241 --> 02:23:30,610
you know,

4654
02:23:30,610 --> 02:23:31,980
operating weren't fenced in.

4655
02:23:32,640 --> 02:23:32,971
No,

4656
02:23:32,971 --> 02:23:35,460
they weren't fenced in because there
was no fence that would keep them in.

4657
02:23:35,461 --> 02:23:39,450
How in the world can you ever fence
a pig in with a physical structure?

4658
02:23:39,451 --> 02:23:40,060
Even,

4659
02:23:40,060 --> 02:23:40,260
I mean,

4660
02:23:40,260 --> 02:23:41,100
this is before,

4661
02:23:41,101 --> 02:23:42,780
before a metal wire,

4662
02:23:43,110 --> 02:23:43,381
you know,

4663
02:23:43,381 --> 02:23:44,850
the only fence they had were like,

4664
02:23:44,990 --> 02:23:45,440
you know,

4665
02:23:45,440 --> 02:23:45,790
uh,

4666
02:23:45,790 --> 02:23:46,050
uh,

4667
02:23:46,050 --> 02:23:46,710
rick's of,

4668
02:23:46,710 --> 02:23:47,410
of um,

4669
02:23:47,410 --> 02:23:47,641
you know,

4670
02:23:47,641 --> 02:23:49,410
you've seen them around museums and stuff,

4671
02:23:49,411 --> 02:23:49,910
little,

4672
02:23:49,910 --> 02:23:50,340
you know,

4673
02:23:50,340 --> 02:23:53,040
a chestnut rail fences will,

4674
02:23:53,041 --> 02:23:54,690
a pig would tear that apart in a hurry.

4675
02:23:54,960 --> 02:23:56,040
So what they did,

4676
02:23:56,460 --> 02:23:56,880
they,

4677
02:23:56,880 --> 02:23:57,990
they farmed,

4678
02:23:58,320 --> 02:24:02,940
they had an agriculture that was
primarily exclusionary rather than

4679
02:24:02,941 --> 02:24:03,840
inclusionary.

4680
02:24:03,960 --> 02:24:05,100
So instead of,

4681
02:24:05,130 --> 02:24:06,120
instead of having,

4682
02:24:06,480 --> 02:24:06,721
I mean,

4683
02:24:06,721 --> 02:24:09,510
Thomas Jefferson wrote about
this at marcelo in his farm book,

4684
02:24:09,690 --> 02:24:14,690
he had several slave boys that their
job was to keep the livestock out of the

4685
02:24:15,331 --> 02:24:16,164
gardens.

4686
02:24:17,350 --> 02:24:17,820
So,

4687
02:24:17,820 --> 02:24:20,400
so the idea was that
the livestock basically,

4688
02:24:20,450 --> 02:24:20,910
you know,

4689
02:24:20,910 --> 02:24:22,890
ran free maybe,

4690
02:24:22,920 --> 02:24:25,410
maybe with a herder or
something or you know,

4691
02:24:25,411 --> 02:24:27,660
there were some fields but not that many.

4692
02:24:28,170 --> 02:24:30,990
And then what you did
is you protected your,

4693
02:24:31,240 --> 02:24:31,460
you know,

4694
02:24:31,460 --> 02:24:31,890
your,

4695
02:24:31,890 --> 02:24:32,521
your garden,

4696
02:24:32,521 --> 02:24:34,350
you protected your berries and you're,

4697
02:24:34,351 --> 02:24:34,561
you know,

4698
02:24:34,561 --> 02:24:36,660
you're really high value stuff.

4699
02:24:37,050 --> 02:24:39,690
You protected that
physically or with a fence,

4700
02:24:40,240 --> 02:24:44,940
some sort of a barricade because you
simply couldn't afford to fence all the

4701
02:24:44,941 --> 02:24:46,110
animals and control them.

4702
02:24:46,350 --> 02:24:46,860
So,

4703
02:24:46,860 --> 02:24:48,330
so it became,

4704
02:24:48,390 --> 02:24:51,960
it became a lot easier to um,

4705
02:24:52,770 --> 02:24:57,770
to grow animals faster with grain than
it did with controlled grazing because

4706
02:25:01,861 --> 02:25:03,060
you couldn't control the grazing.

4707
02:25:03,690 --> 02:25:07,980
So now the technology
of electric fencing and,

4708
02:25:08,730 --> 02:25:09,510
and uh,

4709
02:25:09,510 --> 02:25:14,510
and composting has enabled us to bring
the perennial pasture based model onto a

4710
02:25:20,641 --> 02:25:23,160
par with the grain model.

4711
02:25:23,530 --> 02:25:28,530
And the beauty of that is that the pasture
based on non tillage model is an alt

4712
02:25:29,471 --> 02:25:33,930
is it's a soil building engine
as opposed to tillage was s,

4713
02:25:34,030 --> 02:25:35,890
which is a soil destroying engine.

4714
02:25:36,760 --> 02:25:37,270
And so,

4715
02:25:37,270 --> 02:25:38,390
so all of this,

4716
02:25:38,391 --> 02:25:38,830
you know,

4717
02:25:38,830 --> 02:25:41,230
all of this has to be viewed
in context and you have to,

4718
02:25:41,440 --> 02:25:42,430
you have to appreciate,

4719
02:25:42,730 --> 02:25:43,210
uh,

4720
02:25:43,210 --> 02:25:45,280
I tell people you don't crucify grandpa,

4721
02:25:45,480 --> 02:25:45,950
you know,

4722
02:25:45,950 --> 02:25:46,410
he,

4723
02:25:46,410 --> 02:25:46,660
he,

4724
02:25:46,660 --> 02:25:47,170
he,

4725
02:25:47,170 --> 02:25:48,820
he was trying to do what he did,

4726
02:25:49,060 --> 02:25:49,690
but uh,

4727
02:25:49,690 --> 02:25:54,690
but there's no excuse today for continuing
grandpa's situation because we don't

4728
02:25:54,761 --> 02:25:55,594
have,

4729
02:25:55,870 --> 02:25:57,760
we've got grant things that
grandpa would have gIven.

4730
02:25:57,761 --> 02:25:58,960
Is it to have today?

4731
02:25:59,070 --> 02:25:59,341
Yeah.

4732
02:25:59,341 --> 02:26:00,600
I think as we were saying before,

4733
02:26:00,601 --> 02:26:04,650
they were on the momentum of this past
that was set up that couldn't also,

4734
02:26:04,651 --> 02:26:07,920
probably couldn't possIbly
have anticipated the amount
of population growth that

4735
02:26:07,921 --> 02:26:08,754
we have today.

4736
02:26:08,910 --> 02:26:11,880
That's very possible when
you look at our future as a,

4737
02:26:11,950 --> 02:26:13,950
as a country and feeding us.

4738
02:26:13,980 --> 02:26:15,150
Do you have hope?

4739
02:26:15,390 --> 02:26:15,781
Do you,

4740
02:26:15,781 --> 02:26:17,730
do you think that people
are coming around?

4741
02:26:18,300 --> 02:26:21,330
People are certainly more aware where
their food comes from now than ever

4742
02:26:21,331 --> 02:26:22,110
before.

4743
02:26:22,110 --> 02:26:23,850
Do you see changes on the horizon?

4744
02:26:24,430 --> 02:26:25,263
I sure do,

4745
02:26:25,300 --> 02:26:26,133
and I'm,

4746
02:26:26,640 --> 02:26:27,320
I'm a,

4747
02:26:27,320 --> 02:26:29,080
I'm a pretty incorrigible optimist.

4748
02:26:29,140 --> 02:26:29,511
Uh,

4749
02:26:29,511 --> 02:26:34,511
overall I don't think though
that the changes will be gentle.

4750
02:26:37,450 --> 02:26:42,450
You have to understand if what I've
described in this program became normal,

4751
02:26:44,920 --> 02:26:47,710
it would completely
invert the power position,

4752
02:26:47,711 --> 02:26:52,540
prestige and profit of the
entire food and farming industry.

4753
02:26:53,410 --> 02:26:57,100
That's a big ship to turn around and
they're not going to go gently into the

4754
02:26:57,101 --> 02:26:57,934
night.

4755
02:26:58,480 --> 02:27:01,750
And so that's why we're seeing
the backlash of the swat teams,

4756
02:27:01,751 --> 02:27:01,940
you know,

4757
02:27:01,940 --> 02:27:02,531
coming in,

4758
02:27:02,531 --> 02:27:03,880
raiding people's freezers,

4759
02:27:04,210 --> 02:27:05,410
private food clubs,

4760
02:27:05,800 --> 02:27:08,950
we're seeing an increasing backlash.

4761
02:27:09,140 --> 02:27:09,390
The,

4762
02:27:09,390 --> 02:27:11,290
the food safety modernization act,

4763
02:27:11,520 --> 02:27:12,220
uh,

4764
02:27:12,220 --> 02:27:12,521
you know,

4765
02:27:12,521 --> 02:27:14,670
proposed that a,

4766
02:27:14,710 --> 02:27:18,280
you basically couldn't use
compost to fertilize vegetables.

4767
02:27:18,490 --> 02:27:18,720
Uh,

4768
02:27:18,720 --> 02:27:22,150
we can't have animals and
produce on the same farm.

4769
02:27:23,020 --> 02:27:27,220
We're going to outlaw of outdoor
flocks of 3000 chickens are more,

4770
02:27:27,450 --> 02:27:27,730
uh,

4771
02:27:27,730 --> 02:27:28,171
I mean there's,

4772
02:27:28,171 --> 02:27:28,481
there's a,

4773
02:27:28,481 --> 02:27:31,480
there's a huge pushback from,

4774
02:27:32,230 --> 02:27:33,550
from that orthodoxy.

4775
02:27:33,970 --> 02:27:34,810
And um,

4776
02:27:35,440 --> 02:27:37,390
and I generally,

4777
02:27:37,391 --> 02:27:37,661
you know,

4778
02:27:37,661 --> 02:27:41,190
if you studied collapser
guns and germs or 14,

4779
02:27:41,210 --> 02:27:42,640
93 or whatever,

4780
02:27:42,910 --> 02:27:43,301
uh,

4781
02:27:43,301 --> 02:27:48,301
what you find is that major societal
change generally doesn't happen.

4782
02:27:49,080 --> 02:27:49,240
You knoW,

4783
02:27:49,240 --> 02:27:51,160
people don't just wake up and say,

4784
02:27:51,910 --> 02:27:56,890
I think I want a different society
know it usually follows some major,

4785
02:27:57,760 --> 02:27:59,590
major thing and uh,

4786
02:27:59,591 --> 02:28:04,591
I mean the transition from draft power
to automobile was incredibly disturbing,

4787
02:28:07,900 --> 02:28:08,500
you know,

4788
02:28:08,500 --> 02:28:09,520
in America.

4789
02:28:10,030 --> 02:28:10,720
Uh,

4790
02:28:10,720 --> 02:28:11,530
and,

4791
02:28:11,530 --> 02:28:15,070
and I think that that if the industry.

4792
02:28:15,170 --> 02:28:17,050
Let me give you one more little story.

4793
02:28:17,380 --> 02:28:18,370
I spoke last week.

4794
02:28:18,371 --> 02:28:21,770
I'm getting ready to go to the Netherlands
and do a week of seminars in the

4795
02:28:21,771 --> 02:28:22,604
Netherlands.

4796
02:28:23,180 --> 02:28:24,013
I spoke to their,

4797
02:28:24,230 --> 02:28:29,230
one of their top ag journalist this week
did an interview by phone and he said

4798
02:28:31,671 --> 02:28:35,750
that the previous week he had just
interviewed the ceo of syngenta,

4799
02:28:35,960 --> 02:28:38,960
which is the european
counterpart of monsanto.

4800
02:28:39,440 --> 02:28:42,470
And several years ago they adopted a plan,

4801
02:28:42,860 --> 02:28:43,400
a,

4802
02:28:43,400 --> 02:28:47,420
a target that they Would
increase productivity in grains,

4803
02:28:47,450 --> 02:28:51,140
the grains that they were
working on by 20 percent,

4804
02:28:51,141 --> 02:28:51,974
by 20 slash 20,

4805
02:28:52,700 --> 02:28:53,620
20 percent by 2020.

4806
02:28:53,640 --> 02:28:54,980
Has a nice ring to it.

4807
02:28:55,820 --> 02:28:56,120
Well,

4808
02:28:56,120 --> 02:28:57,710
there are several years into that plan.

4809
02:28:57,980 --> 02:28:58,401
He said,

4810
02:28:58,401 --> 02:29:00,320
for the last 15 years,

4811
02:29:01,730 --> 02:29:03,050
it's been totally flat.

4812
02:29:03,380 --> 02:29:04,790
Nothing we can do,

4813
02:29:05,390 --> 02:29:06,710
nothing we can invent.

4814
02:29:06,711 --> 02:29:11,711
Nothing we can do has been able to change
grain production at all for the last

4815
02:29:12,021 --> 02:29:12,920
15 years.

4816
02:29:14,660 --> 02:29:19,310
What we're seeing is what joel Arthur
Barker said when he wrote the book

4817
02:29:19,311 --> 02:29:21,050
paradigms 40 years ago,

4818
02:29:21,051 --> 02:29:22,670
introduced the word to the world.

4819
02:29:22,970 --> 02:29:23,780
He said,

4820
02:29:23,780 --> 02:29:28,780
one of the axioms of paradigms is that
just when they appear to have achieved

4821
02:29:31,040 --> 02:29:31,873
perfection,

4822
02:29:32,360 --> 02:29:37,360
they're on the brink of collapse and
the industrial food system has promised

4823
02:29:39,110 --> 02:29:39,921
disease,

4824
02:29:39,921 --> 02:29:41,300
free famine,

4825
02:29:41,301 --> 02:29:42,134
free,

4826
02:29:43,030 --> 02:29:43,850
you know,

4827
02:29:43,850 --> 02:29:44,683
a

4828
02:29:46,190 --> 02:29:47,120
paradise,

4829
02:29:49,100 --> 02:29:52,130
and now with gmos and there,

4830
02:29:52,150 --> 02:29:57,150
there are a lot of people that are
really pumped up on their hubris who have

4831
02:29:59,780 --> 02:30:04,780
bought into this notion that we're going
to go into some paradise nirvana only

4832
02:30:05,871 --> 02:30:06,740
to find out,

4833
02:30:07,610 --> 02:30:08,420
oops,

4834
02:30:08,420 --> 02:30:13,420
I'm gmos are causing spontaneous
abortions and infertility.

4835
02:30:14,300 --> 02:30:15,020
Oops.

4836
02:30:15,020 --> 02:30:15,651
Is that true?

4837
02:30:15,651 --> 02:30:16,320
I mean,

4838
02:30:16,320 --> 02:30:18,050
whereas evidence to don huber,

4839
02:30:18,051 --> 02:30:18,580
I mean,

4840
02:30:18,580 --> 02:30:19,620
have him on your show.

4841
02:30:19,621 --> 02:30:20,031
A don.

4842
02:30:20,031 --> 02:30:24,350
He reads a professor in ameritas from
purdue university and he's showing the

4843
02:30:24,351 --> 02:30:26,180
direct relationship between,

4844
02:30:26,550 --> 02:30:27,060
uh,

4845
02:30:27,060 --> 02:30:27,261
or,

4846
02:30:27,261 --> 02:30:29,240
or have Jeffrey Smith on a,

4847
02:30:29,241 --> 02:30:32,000
but the direct relationship
between a glyphosate,

4848
02:30:32,001 --> 02:30:32,870
which is roundup,

4849
02:30:33,260 --> 02:30:33,591
which is,

4850
02:30:33,591 --> 02:30:34,424
which is the,

4851
02:30:34,730 --> 02:30:39,230
which is the herbicide that's now
doubled in use since gmos came out.

4852
02:30:39,260 --> 02:30:41,330
That was the number one thing.

4853
02:30:41,720 --> 02:30:42,553
Um,

4854
02:30:42,700 --> 02:30:43,111
and,

4855
02:30:43,111 --> 02:30:44,480
and there are absolutely,

4856
02:30:44,710 --> 02:30:45,490
absolutely,

4857
02:30:45,490 --> 02:30:45,950
uh,

4858
02:30:45,950 --> 02:30:47,420
in the last year.

4859
02:30:47,421 --> 02:30:47,950
So we're,

4860
02:30:47,950 --> 02:30:51,950
we're in our 15th year with gmos.

4861
02:30:53,000 --> 02:30:58,000
Remember it took 14 years to establish
the ddt relationship with infertile frogs

4862
02:30:59,931 --> 02:31:00,681
in an exit,

4863
02:31:00,681 --> 02:31:01,514
wouldn't hatch.

4864
02:31:01,670 --> 02:31:02,840
We're now 15 years.

4865
02:31:03,050 --> 02:31:08,050
Last year there were something like 74
studies around the world impugning not

4866
02:31:09,471 --> 02:31:10,760
only the claims,

4867
02:31:11,870 --> 02:31:13,970
but showing harmful side effects,

4868
02:31:14,120 --> 02:31:16,490
collateral damage of gmos.

4869
02:31:17,880 --> 02:31:18,650
the,

4870
02:31:18,650 --> 02:31:23,650
the idea that gmos are actually more
productive is pretty much universally

4871
02:31:23,671 --> 02:31:24,090
debunk.

4872
02:31:24,090 --> 02:31:24,630
Now,

4873
02:31:24,630 --> 02:31:27,570
they simply have not shown
a productivity increase.

4874
02:31:28,620 --> 02:31:33,620
And so what I'm getting at is that
the industry has continued to peg a,

4875
02:31:36,150 --> 02:31:38,910
the future on this thing and present this,

4876
02:31:38,911 --> 02:31:39,744
this kind of,

4877
02:31:40,710 --> 02:31:41,390
uh,

4878
02:31:41,390 --> 02:31:41,940
um,

4879
02:31:41,940 --> 02:31:42,630
you know,

4880
02:31:42,630 --> 02:31:45,630
argument this face that all is well,

4881
02:31:45,810 --> 02:31:46,171
man,

4882
02:31:46,171 --> 02:31:46,361
we're,

4883
02:31:46,361 --> 02:31:48,300
we're getting ready to perfect everything.

4884
02:31:48,301 --> 02:31:49,134
It's going to be,

4885
02:31:49,400 --> 02:31:50,233
you know,

4886
02:31:50,240 --> 02:31:51,960
it's going to be a new day in the morning,

4887
02:31:52,020 --> 02:31:52,710
right?

4888
02:31:52,710 --> 02:31:55,200
And suddenly we see all these studies.

4889
02:31:55,230 --> 02:31:56,430
We see these direct science,

4890
02:31:56,460 --> 02:31:57,600
causal links,

4891
02:31:57,601 --> 02:31:58,530
collateral damage.

4892
02:31:58,680 --> 02:31:59,460
We see,

4893
02:31:59,460 --> 02:31:59,940
you know,

4894
02:31:59,940 --> 02:32:03,060
one in four pigs right
now in the industry,

4895
02:32:03,190 --> 02:32:03,510
you know,

4896
02:32:03,510 --> 02:32:05,550
is dying from a viral.

4897
02:32:06,630 --> 02:32:07,950
We see these things.

4898
02:32:07,951 --> 02:32:08,640
We see,

4899
02:32:08,640 --> 02:32:09,120
you know,

4900
02:32:09,120 --> 02:32:12,240
a listeria campylobacter,

4901
02:32:13,710 --> 02:32:14,580
salmonella,

4902
02:32:14,581 --> 02:32:15,450
e cola,

4903
02:32:16,080 --> 02:32:18,240
all these new latin squiggly words,

4904
02:32:18,241 --> 02:32:18,481
you know,

4905
02:32:18,481 --> 02:32:18,901
food,

4906
02:32:18,901 --> 02:32:19,591
pathogens,

4907
02:32:19,591 --> 02:32:20,970
autism on the increase.

4908
02:32:22,440 --> 02:32:27,440
My take is that we are just
about ready for nature to say,

4909
02:32:28,470 --> 02:32:28,741
you know,

4910
02:32:28,741 --> 02:32:29,574
you,

4911
02:32:29,740 --> 02:32:30,420
you have,

4912
02:32:30,420 --> 02:32:31,940
you have taken enough shortcuts.

4913
02:32:31,950 --> 02:32:34,470
Now I'm going to bat and,

4914
02:32:34,471 --> 02:32:34,800
and,

4915
02:32:34,800 --> 02:32:39,800
and it follows barker's idea that all
paradigms at the point of perfection or on

4916
02:32:40,861 --> 02:32:44,580
the brink of collapse when
they're presented as perfect,

4917
02:32:44,940 --> 02:32:46,500
that's when they're on
the brink of collapse.

4918
02:32:49,920 --> 02:32:50,300
I hope

4919
02:32:50,300 --> 02:32:51,470
people are listening to you.

4920
02:32:51,650 --> 02:32:53,660
I know people in the
podcast listening to you,

4921
02:32:53,661 --> 02:32:57,860
but I hope people out there in the world
of agriculture are really are listening

4922
02:32:57,861 --> 02:32:58,041
to you.

4923
02:32:58,041 --> 02:32:58,401
I know you,

4924
02:32:58,401 --> 02:33:00,770
there's a lot of blowback a against you,

4925
02:33:00,771 --> 02:33:01,840
but I sure I,

4926
02:33:01,950 --> 02:33:04,910
I hope people are taking
into consideration all these
things that you're saying

4927
02:33:04,911 --> 02:33:09,911
is there's so much logic to your words
and there's so much wisdom and so much

4928
02:33:10,491 --> 02:33:12,880
research done that it just,

4929
02:33:12,890 --> 02:33:13,191
it's,

4930
02:33:13,191 --> 02:33:14,024
um,

4931
02:33:14,390 --> 02:33:18,920
it's a very puzzling situation for someone
like me who knows very little about

4932
02:33:18,950 --> 02:33:22,310
other than talking to you and
reading and watching documentaries.

4933
02:33:22,311 --> 02:33:23,030
It's a,

4934
02:33:23,030 --> 02:33:24,890
it's a very strange time.

4935
02:33:25,880 --> 02:33:26,610
It is indeed.

4936
02:33:26,610 --> 02:33:29,190
And that's why I encourage people to,

4937
02:33:29,240 --> 02:33:29,950
um,

4938
02:33:29,950 --> 02:33:34,950
to take their recreation entertainment
budget of time and time and money and,

4939
02:33:36,350 --> 02:33:39,110
and start to participate
in the food system.

4940
02:33:39,111 --> 02:33:40,460
Go visit a couple of farmers.

4941
02:33:40,630 --> 02:33:41,030
You know,

4942
02:33:41,030 --> 02:33:46,030
every single community is surrounded
by really integrity farmers now they're

4943
02:33:46,551 --> 02:33:47,151
everywhere.

4944
02:33:47,151 --> 02:33:47,930
They're everywhere.

4945
02:33:47,930 --> 02:33:49,960
There is not a community in,

4946
02:33:50,060 --> 02:33:55,060
in the country that is devoid of
really high quality integrity food.

4947
02:33:57,020 --> 02:34:00,500
Many of them are wanting
to farm full time,

4948
02:34:00,520 --> 02:34:00,620
you know,

4949
02:34:00,620 --> 02:34:05,060
and they need like 10 more customers or
more customers to tip them over so they

4950
02:34:05,061 --> 02:34:08,650
don't have to commute to town with
the town job to support their pharm

4951
02:34:08,651 --> 02:34:09,484
addiction.

4952
02:34:11,210 --> 02:34:13,010
I implore urban people,

4953
02:34:13,940 --> 02:34:14,773
you know,

4954
02:34:15,230 --> 02:34:16,520
go To one less moVie,

4955
02:34:16,550 --> 02:34:19,170
go to leSs whatever,

4956
02:34:19,171 --> 02:34:19,480
you know,

4957
02:34:19,480 --> 02:34:19,960
opera,

4958
02:34:19,960 --> 02:34:20,650
whatever,

4959
02:34:20,650 --> 02:34:21,280
um,

4960
02:34:21,280 --> 02:34:21,670
but,

4961
02:34:21,670 --> 02:34:24,130
but invest in this,

4962
02:34:24,580 --> 02:34:27,700
in this integrity food idea,

4963
02:34:28,240 --> 02:34:32,560
and you will hear farmers say the
same things I'm saying they'll use

4964
02:34:34,070 --> 02:34:36,670
and you'll be able to see it with
your eyes and you'll be able to,

4965
02:34:36,910 --> 02:34:38,200
you'll be able to taste,

4966
02:34:38,201 --> 02:34:38,621
see,

4967
02:34:38,621 --> 02:34:39,101
touch.

4968
02:34:39,101 --> 02:34:44,101
You Will essentially connect with your
ecological umbilical and that's a good

4969
02:34:45,431 --> 02:34:46,264
place to be.

4970
02:34:46,380 --> 02:34:48,380
I love the term integrity food too.

4971
02:34:48,470 --> 02:34:50,310
That's a really is a great term.

4972
02:34:50,390 --> 02:34:51,110
Yeah.

4973
02:34:51,110 --> 02:34:52,050
I love that.

4974
02:34:52,051 --> 02:34:52,900
You throw that around and,

4975
02:34:52,901 --> 02:34:53,250
and I,

4976
02:34:53,250 --> 02:34:57,480
I think what you're offering a
as far as advice is fantastic.

4977
02:34:57,481 --> 02:34:59,760
Encourage people to go to
these farmer's markets,

4978
02:34:59,790 --> 02:35:04,770
connect to these people that are growing
food in this way and I think people are

4979
02:35:05,160 --> 02:35:09,300
most certainly more aware now than
ever of where their food's coming from.

4980
02:35:09,301 --> 02:35:10,260
The term organic.

4981
02:35:10,290 --> 02:35:13,920
We never even heard that a couple of
decades ago when it comes to food,

4982
02:35:13,930 --> 02:35:14,970
which just didn't exist.

4983
02:35:15,010 --> 02:35:17,400
Nobody talked about it and
we've talked about gmos.

4984
02:35:17,580 --> 02:35:18,780
Nobody talked about anything.

4985
02:35:19,440 --> 02:35:24,440
All the 14 plus years that we have had
gmos have been this massive series of

4986
02:35:25,651 --> 02:35:28,020
debates and denials and you know,

4987
02:35:28,260 --> 02:35:31,170
but I think people are more aware of it
than ever before and I think a lot of is

4988
02:35:31,171 --> 02:35:32,190
because of people like you.

4989
02:35:32,610 --> 02:35:34,860
So thank you very much and
thanks for coming on here.

4990
02:35:34,861 --> 02:35:36,450
It was a really interesting conversation.

4991
02:35:36,451 --> 02:35:36,781
I've really,

4992
02:35:36,781 --> 02:35:40,080
really enjoyed it and I really appreciate
all of your knowledge and the fact

4993
02:35:40,081 --> 02:35:40,381
