00:00:00,990 --> 00:00:02,880
Hello Freak bitches.

2
00:00:03,150 --> 00:00:06,060
But it's just like those same people who
will be like a year like against women,

3
00:00:06,061 --> 00:00:10,800
like I would never in a million
years go out to a show and be like,

4
00:00:10,830 --> 00:00:12,990
I'm just rooting for the men today.

5
00:00:13,290 --> 00:00:13,531
Like,

6
00:00:13,531 --> 00:00:13,810
like I,

7
00:00:13,810 --> 00:00:15,240
I don't think this way.

8
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:17,130
I'm not like on team man,

9
00:00:17,131 --> 00:00:18,690
but you are on team women.

10
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:19,590
Like it's just,

11
00:00:19,590 --> 00:00:22,290
it just seems to me that
there's a lot of that going on.

12
00:00:22,291 --> 00:00:22,801
You know what I mean?

13
00:00:22,801 --> 00:00:27,030
A lot of that shit where it's like you
kind of projected this thing that you see

14
00:00:27,031 --> 00:00:29,700
racism everywhere or you
see sexism everywhere.

15
00:00:29,790 --> 00:00:33,260
But all I really see is you fucking
lecturing people based on race and send

16
00:00:33,270 --> 00:00:33,841
their mind.

17
00:00:33,841 --> 00:00:37,050
They're allowed to do it the same way
Cain Velasquez allowed to have brown pride

18
00:00:37,051 --> 00:00:39,390
and his chest kind of same thing.

19
00:00:39,391 --> 00:00:39,900
Like you'll,

20
00:00:39,900 --> 00:00:44,640
you're disenfranchised or you're
marginalized so you're allowed to stay.

21
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:45,421
Even if you're not,

22
00:00:45,421 --> 00:00:48,900
you playing that victim card as a
woman and you're allowed to say,

23
00:00:48,901 --> 00:00:50,160
I'm here to support my girl.

24
00:00:50,470 --> 00:00:51,960
Like I was talking about
this on stage of the day.

25
00:00:51,961 --> 00:00:53,370
I saw a bumper sticker on a car.

26
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:54,900
It said girls kick ass.

27
00:00:55,170 --> 00:00:56,003
And I was like,

28
00:00:56,520 --> 00:00:57,353
some of them,

29
00:00:57,650 --> 00:00:57,900
yeah,

30
00:00:57,900 --> 00:00:59,370
some of them are lazy slobs.

31
00:00:59,420 --> 00:01:00,720
I like what are you gonna
Align yourself with?

32
00:01:00,721 --> 00:01:03,000
150 million women just
in this country alone.

33
00:01:03,001 --> 00:01:03,834
That's ridiculous.

34
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:05,820
And I was saying if a
guy had a bumper sticker,

35
00:01:05,970 --> 00:01:07,230
it said boys kick ass.

36
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:10,980
He be like follow that guy and find
out where he's been fucking these kids.

37
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:11,341
Cause he,

38
00:01:11,341 --> 00:01:11,671
first of all,

39
00:01:11,671 --> 00:01:12,840
you never say boys,

40
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:14,430
boys kick ass.

41
00:01:14,431 --> 00:01:15,600
You put that on your bumper.

42
00:01:15,601 --> 00:01:16,710
So where the fuck are you?

43
00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:17,551
You'd pull them over.

44
00:01:17,551 --> 00:01:18,361
Let me see your license.

45
00:01:18,361 --> 00:01:19,141
Where do you live man?

46
00:01:19,141 --> 00:01:20,100
What do you do for a living?

47
00:01:20,350 --> 00:01:21,900
What's that bumper sticker about?

48
00:01:21,901 --> 00:01:23,070
What the fuck do you mean by that?

49
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:24,390
And I don't need,

50
00:01:24,390 --> 00:01:27,300
like I almost feel like an
asshole sometimes where I
preface everything with a

51
00:01:27,301 --> 00:01:28,150
disclaimer like,

52
00:01:28,170 --> 00:01:29,700
and I'm not saying this and I'm not,

53
00:01:29,850 --> 00:01:33,120
but I just want it to be clear that I'm
not saying there aren't exceptions to

54
00:01:33,121 --> 00:01:33,750
the rule,

55
00:01:33,750 --> 00:01:37,080
but it's also kind of strange to me that
like if you want to celebrate women,

56
00:01:37,230 --> 00:01:39,810
why are you celebrating
such a masculine quality?

57
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:40,740
Like it's kind of like,

58
00:01:40,741 --> 00:01:41,100
it's like,

59
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:41,311
look,

60
00:01:41,311 --> 00:01:43,470
there are white players who
are great basketball players,

61
00:01:43,471 --> 00:01:43,860
right?

62
00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:44,410
There are white.

63
00:01:44,410 --> 00:01:46,620
The Dark Novitsky was an
amazing basketball player,

64
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:49,770
but if I just wrote somewhere like
white people kick ass at basketball,

65
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:50,551
it's like,

66
00:01:50,551 --> 00:01:51,384
well,

67
00:01:51,540 --> 00:01:52,310
actually,

68
00:01:52,310 --> 00:01:53,910
well this is that movie
coming on in general.

69
00:01:53,940 --> 00:01:55,560
Women don't kick ass in general.

70
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:56,700
Generally speaking,

71
00:01:56,730 --> 00:01:58,110
that's a male thing to do.

72
00:01:58,650 --> 00:02:00,060
I'm not saying there's
not exceptions to that,

73
00:02:00,061 --> 00:02:00,750
but you're like,

74
00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:02,850
you're writing white people
kick ass in basketball.

75
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:03,840
It's kind of misleading.

76
00:02:03,870 --> 00:02:07,500
They don't have the same feelings about
cultural appropriation as some people do

77
00:02:07,501 --> 00:02:09,060
with fucking braids.

78
00:02:09,930 --> 00:02:10,590
Yeah,

79
00:02:10,590 --> 00:02:11,101
yeah.

80
00:02:11,101 --> 00:02:11,610
I get it.

81
00:02:11,610 --> 00:02:11,791
Well,

82
00:02:11,791 --> 00:02:13,020
but it's the United States,

83
00:02:13,050 --> 00:02:13,440
right?

84
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:15,120
We're sending over super sensitive.

85
00:02:15,121 --> 00:02:15,970
We've gotten various senses.

86
00:02:15,980 --> 00:02:16,621
You know what it is,

87
00:02:16,621 --> 00:02:20,720
it all comes from a
litigious culture that's,

88
00:02:20,980 --> 00:02:22,140
oh absolutely.

89
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:25,550
The fact that you can get sued for
anything anybody can sue you at anytime.

90
00:02:25,590 --> 00:02:26,190
That's just like,

91
00:02:26,190 --> 00:02:27,330
that's American culture.

92
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:28,190
That's what you do.

93
00:02:28,190 --> 00:02:28,561
And it's like,

94
00:02:28,561 --> 00:02:29,130
you know what,

95
00:02:29,130 --> 00:02:31,560
you pissed off someone like enough,

96
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:32,753
you can sue them.

97
00:02:33,330 --> 00:02:34,620
And so there's a lot of like suing,

98
00:02:34,621 --> 00:02:34,861
swinging,

99
00:02:34,861 --> 00:02:37,860
swinging enough successful
cases along the way.

100
00:02:38,130 --> 00:02:38,851
That's part of,

101
00:02:38,851 --> 00:02:41,460
it's like a fear based operating system.

102
00:02:41,461 --> 00:02:42,150
Right.

103
00:02:42,150 --> 00:02:46,050
Hauling people on Shit maybe
they didn't even think was bad.

104
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:46,440
Yeah.

105
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:48,000
It's a combination of like someone,

106
00:02:48,001 --> 00:02:51,300
like it's a good service to be able
to sue someone if you needed to.

107
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:54,900
However it's abused up the Ying Yang
and there's like professional lawyers,

108
00:02:54,901 --> 00:02:56,040
they have billboards everywhere.

109
00:02:56,070 --> 00:02:58,050
But do you think Katy Perry who
was worried about being sued?

110
00:02:58,380 --> 00:02:58,651
No,

111
00:02:58,651 --> 00:03:01,390
I'm saying that I'm saying
that the sensitivity issue,

112
00:03:01,610 --> 00:03:02,520
like why,

113
00:03:02,530 --> 00:03:07,530
why we're so white American culture is
so like PC at this point because there's

114
00:03:08,711 --> 00:03:09,330
a,

115
00:03:09,330 --> 00:03:10,840
it kind of goes hand in hand.

116
00:03:10,870 --> 00:03:11,930
It's like a sense of,

117
00:03:13,430 --> 00:03:13,920
I dunno,

118
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:14,081
I'm,

119
00:03:14,081 --> 00:03:15,810
I'm at a loss for words
a little bit to stoned,

120
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:16,180
but,

121
00:03:16,180 --> 00:03:21,180
but I will say it's having that litigious
fear based kind of motivator or it

122
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:26,530
causes people to want to correct
things like to correct course,

123
00:03:26,531 --> 00:03:27,010
correct.

124
00:03:27,010 --> 00:03:27,480
To,

125
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:27,910
uh,

126
00:03:27,910 --> 00:03:31,770
to a form of something that works
for everyone to avoid being sued too.

127
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:32,500
I mean,

128
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:33,010
not me,

129
00:03:33,010 --> 00:03:34,150
not directly,

130
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:35,260
not directly,

131
00:03:35,260 --> 00:03:36,490
but that thought process.

132
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:36,721
Yeah.

133
00:03:36,721 --> 00:03:37,554
That,

134
00:03:37,570 --> 00:03:37,841
yeah,

135
00:03:37,841 --> 00:03:38,530
that mindset.

136
00:03:38,530 --> 00:03:40,270
I think that's because it's about like,

137
00:03:40,271 --> 00:03:40,691
okay,

138
00:03:40,691 --> 00:03:42,160
well how can we make this,

139
00:03:42,220 --> 00:03:44,170
we have to include everybody on this,

140
00:03:44,171 --> 00:03:45,310
which I believe in.

141
00:03:45,420 --> 00:03:45,670
Yeah.

142
00:03:45,670 --> 00:03:47,020
But absolutely.

143
00:03:47,290 --> 00:03:47,710
But,

144
00:03:47,710 --> 00:03:48,310
uh,

145
00:03:48,310 --> 00:03:52,900
but I think it should be done out of a
sense of empathy and not to say that,

146
00:03:52,930 --> 00:03:53,260
that,

147
00:03:53,260 --> 00:03:53,970
that,

148
00:03:53,970 --> 00:03:54,370
you know,

149
00:03:54,370 --> 00:03:58,000
people fighting for rights to have
handicap parking like in the front of the

150
00:03:58,001 --> 00:03:58,370
building.

151
00:03:58,370 --> 00:04:01,030
Like there's thing
that's just a great idea.

152
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:01,900
But like,

153
00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:02,733
I'm just saying that the,

154
00:04:02,820 --> 00:04:03,520
what were you,

155
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:06,940
you were kind of referring
to that sensitivity come,

156
00:04:06,941 --> 00:04:09,790
comes from that where someone's like
afraid of doing something wrong.

157
00:04:10,010 --> 00:04:10,390
Yeah.

158
00:04:10,390 --> 00:04:12,070
And it just starts feeding
back and feeding back,

159
00:04:12,071 --> 00:04:12,671
feeding back.

160
00:04:12,671 --> 00:04:15,850
And then you get people so fearful
of any choice that they're making.

161
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:16,981
Who Was it?

162
00:04:16,981 --> 00:04:18,520
Was it Roosevelt who tried to,

163
00:04:18,570 --> 00:04:18,960
no,

164
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:19,793
it was

165
00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:21,200
southerners weren't lazy.

166
00:04:21,201 --> 00:04:22,580
Just infected with hookworms.

167
00:04:22,581 --> 00:04:26,960
A story of the postbellum
south as told by parasites.

168
00:04:27,650 --> 00:04:28,400
Holy Shit.

169
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:28,481
Yeah.

170
00:04:28,481 --> 00:04:30,590
It makes your teeth fall
out and it needs more brain,

171
00:04:30,620 --> 00:04:30,870
Huh?

172
00:04:30,870 --> 00:04:34,350
Stereotypes are almost always
the conclusion of Lazy Science.

173
00:04:35,260 --> 00:04:40,260
They're just empirical generalizations
that are stripped of their variances and

174
00:04:40,261 --> 00:04:43,890
encoded as fact and to the collective
consciousness of the general population.

175
00:04:44,150 --> 00:04:44,790
They're the two Bubba,

176
00:04:44,790 --> 00:04:44,921
blah,

177
00:04:44,921 --> 00:04:45,061
blah,

178
00:04:45,061 --> 00:04:45,241
blah,

179
00:04:45,241 --> 00:04:45,361
blah,

180
00:04:45,361 --> 00:04:45,540
blah.

181
00:04:45,540 --> 00:04:45,901
However,

182
00:04:45,901 --> 00:04:50,100
sometimes the stereotype reveals a hidden
truth that provides an origin to the

183
00:04:50,101 --> 00:04:50,550
myth.

184
00:04:50,550 --> 00:04:54,450
The trope of the Lazy Southerner dates
back to America's postbellum period

185
00:04:54,451 --> 00:04:55,830
following the end of the civil war.

186
00:04:56,190 --> 00:04:57,810
No one really knows where it came from,

187
00:04:57,811 --> 00:05:02,811
but the image of [inaudible]
filthy drawling farmer has
pervaded art literature

188
00:05:03,150 --> 00:05:06,180
and pop your culture until
up until this very moment.

189
00:05:07,020 --> 00:05:09,480
So one argument recently
published by Rachel,

190
00:05:09,481 --> 00:05:13,740
newer for PBS Nova tax present some
compelling evidence for the theory that a

191
00:05:13,741 --> 00:05:18,480
hookworm epidemic was responsible
for the rural stereotype holding holy

192
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:19,140
shit.

193
00:05:19,140 --> 00:05:22,900
Germ of laziness through the exhaustion
mental fogginess attends to inflict upon

194
00:05:22,901 --> 00:05:23,501
its victims.

195
00:05:23,501 --> 00:05:26,750
Historical evidence shows that the
parasite ravaged the American south

196
00:05:26,751 --> 00:05:29,650
throughout the early 20th century as a
result of poor sanitation and lack of

197
00:05:29,651 --> 00:05:31,330
public health programs among the poor,

198
00:05:31,790 --> 00:05:34,960
whole crazy by 1905 the parasite ologist.

199
00:05:34,961 --> 00:05:35,980
That's a job.

200
00:05:38,110 --> 00:05:38,730
I'm a joke.

201
00:05:38,730 --> 00:05:40,690
Topologist Charles says,

202
00:05:40,691 --> 00:05:42,280
as we have 40% or more,

203
00:05:42,281 --> 00:05:45,910
not 60% I was wrong of the southern
population was infected with hookworms.

204
00:05:45,911 --> 00:05:48,760
The parasite thrives and fecal matter
and the combination of shoddy waste

205
00:05:48,761 --> 00:05:50,200
disposal in the rarity of shoes,

206
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:50,981
shoes,

207
00:05:50,981 --> 00:05:54,610
no shoes allowed hookworm larvae to
enter people's bodies through the webbing

208
00:05:54,611 --> 00:05:55,690
between their toes.

209
00:05:55,691 --> 00:05:56,524
How Fun.

210
00:05:57,170 --> 00:05:58,190
Once they penetrate the skin,

211
00:05:58,191 --> 00:06:01,580
they traveled through their hosts lungs
into their intestines where they survive

212
00:06:01,581 --> 00:06:02,480
on a diet of blood,

213
00:06:02,481 --> 00:06:04,430
they suck out from the
intestinal wall of female.

214
00:06:04,431 --> 00:06:07,490
Hookworm can lay up to
10,000 eggs in a single day,

215
00:06:07,491 --> 00:06:11,120
which gives you an idea of how ramping
a localized infestation can become an a

216
00:06:11,121 --> 00:06:11,954
very short time.

217
00:06:12,020 --> 00:06:14,360
The laziness that is
synonymous with hookworm.

218
00:06:14,870 --> 00:06:18,860
Hookworm infections is a synonym of iron
deficiency anemia due to blood loss.

219
00:06:18,890 --> 00:06:19,940
Holy Shit.

220
00:06:20,190 --> 00:06:21,380
Getting bled out.

221
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:21,960
Yes.

222
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:25,010
40% of people were anemic
and had blood loss.

223
00:06:25,011 --> 00:06:26,090
The poor malnourished victims,

224
00:06:26,091 --> 00:06:27,860
the parasite can cause stunted growth.

225
00:06:27,861 --> 00:06:28,650
That's right.

226
00:06:28,650 --> 00:06:28,970
Uh,

227
00:06:28,970 --> 00:06:29,930
children with hookworms,

228
00:06:29,931 --> 00:06:31,850
we're plagued with
attention deficit disorders,

229
00:06:31,851 --> 00:06:35,690
lower Iq and the infected often
had strange food cravings for dirt,

230
00:06:35,691 --> 00:06:37,460
clay paper and chalk.

231
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:39,260
How nuts is that?

232
00:06:39,261 --> 00:06:42,380
Southern states where the nexus of
hookworm friendly climate is the parasite

233
00:06:42,381 --> 00:06:44,360
loved the sandy soil that
makes a real with the region.

234
00:06:44,361 --> 00:06:45,194
So for at all,

235
00:06:45,230 --> 00:06:45,981
in 1910,

236
00:06:45,981 --> 00:06:47,900
7.5 million southerners had hookworms.

237
00:06:48,020 --> 00:06:49,130
Oh my God.

238
00:06:49,190 --> 00:06:49,870
How nuts is that?

239
00:06:49,870 --> 00:06:50,810
That's insane.

240
00:06:50,811 --> 00:06:51,644
Insane.

241
00:06:51,700 --> 00:06:52,250
Yes.

242
00:06:52,250 --> 00:06:55,340
Rockefeller is who donated
money to try to combat it,

243
00:06:55,970 --> 00:06:56,960
but dusty Illuminati,

244
00:06:56,990 --> 00:06:57,860
isn't he like a,

245
00:06:58,970 --> 00:06:59,940
maybe this is all scam,

246
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:04,380
50 years for the worm to be
eradicated from the south.

247
00:07:04,381 --> 00:07:06,480
1960 it was eradicated.

248
00:07:06,870 --> 00:07:07,680
Oh my God.

249
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:09,360
Because of the sanitation issues.

250
00:07:09,870 --> 00:07:10,500
Look at that.

251
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:13,830
Almost entirely freed from
hookworms by 1985 yeah,

252
00:07:14,190 --> 00:07:16,140
that was [inaudible] 20 years ago.

253
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:18,690
That's so recently.

254
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:19,620
It's completely insane.

255
00:07:19,621 --> 00:07:19,901
Yeah.

256
00:07:19,901 --> 00:07:20,660
Is that nuts?

257
00:07:20,660 --> 00:07:20,970
Yeah.

258
00:07:20,970 --> 00:07:21,331
It's never,

259
00:07:21,331 --> 00:07:23,580
she's going to grab my head
and forced me to eat her pussy.

260
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:24,330
Yeah,

261
00:07:24,330 --> 00:07:25,021
great thought though,

262
00:07:25,021 --> 00:07:25,680
isn't it?

263
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:26,580
Being made to do it.

264
00:07:26,581 --> 00:07:27,760
That's one of my greatest turnout.

265
00:07:32,050 --> 00:07:32,883
Stick your tongue

266
00:07:37,180 --> 00:07:39,120
in your mouth

267
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:43,380
or have someone do that.

268
00:07:44,210 --> 00:07:45,210
It was all right.

269
00:07:45,490 --> 00:07:45,990
Not Bad.

270
00:07:45,990 --> 00:07:46,410
Not that.

271
00:07:46,410 --> 00:07:46,711
No.

272
00:07:46,711 --> 00:07:48,870
I had a girl when I had to go and try it.

273
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:49,351
I tell you this,

274
00:07:49,351 --> 00:07:52,260
she's trying to push a fart out and
she shot monistat seven on my chest.

275
00:07:52,850 --> 00:07:53,300
Oh,

276
00:07:53,300 --> 00:07:54,450
fucking horrible.

277
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:55,620
Monistat seven or something.

278
00:07:55,660 --> 00:07:57,080
Girls putting their vaginal infection.

279
00:07:57,210 --> 00:07:57,510
Oh,

280
00:07:57,510 --> 00:07:58,343
Jesus.

281
00:07:58,530 --> 00:07:59,580
Not My best moment.

282
00:07:59,610 --> 00:08:00,443
What it smell like?

283
00:08:01,020 --> 00:08:02,790
I don't believe it had a smell.

284
00:08:02,791 --> 00:08:05,810
I don't remember having a smell
to explain that it was monistat.

285
00:08:05,820 --> 00:08:07,440
I knew exactly what it was.

286
00:08:08,250 --> 00:08:09,750
We both knew what it was,

287
00:08:10,350 --> 00:08:11,183
you know?

288
00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:12,133
No,

289
00:08:12,210 --> 00:08:12,901
it was a bad,

290
00:08:12,901 --> 00:08:13,920
it was a bad scene,

291
00:08:14,670 --> 00:08:16,500
but she was really fucking sexy.

292
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:17,670
Big Fat ass.

293
00:08:17,750 --> 00:08:18,110
Ooh.

294
00:08:18,110 --> 00:08:18,720
Yeah.

295
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:19,860
It's just trying to fart on you.

296
00:08:20,950 --> 00:08:22,020
I don't really care about that,

297
00:08:22,021 --> 00:08:22,321
but I was like,

298
00:08:22,321 --> 00:08:22,441
yeah,

299
00:08:22,441 --> 00:08:23,080
why not?

300
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:23,913
Why aren't my face?

301
00:08:23,970 --> 00:08:25,110
That's whose idea was it?

302
00:08:25,140 --> 00:08:25,973
Mine.

303
00:08:26,420 --> 00:08:26,800
I think she's,

304
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:27,301
I have to,

305
00:08:27,301 --> 00:08:27,521
I'm like,

306
00:08:27,521 --> 00:08:27,810
Hey,

307
00:08:27,810 --> 00:08:28,290
what do you,

308
00:08:28,290 --> 00:08:29,910
you already said you have to no,

309
00:08:29,950 --> 00:08:30,220
no.

310
00:08:30,220 --> 00:08:31,470
I think she saw I have to Fart.

311
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:32,161
Oh,

312
00:08:32,161 --> 00:08:33,020
she said I have to Fart.

313
00:08:33,030 --> 00:08:33,930
And you're like fire my mouth.

314
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:34,860
We had always done that.

315
00:08:34,860 --> 00:08:37,350
Just licked her ass and
she has a great app.

316
00:08:37,380 --> 00:08:37,771
You know what I mean?

317
00:08:37,771 --> 00:08:39,760
We were kind of from that.

318
00:08:40,750 --> 00:08:41,583
Nah,

319
00:08:42,750 --> 00:08:43,770
not that I know of.

320
00:08:43,890 --> 00:08:46,470
Somebody must've terrible
way to feel like,

321
00:08:46,471 --> 00:08:48,930
why didn't I just shower up first?

322
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:50,580
I don't like to shower them up first.

323
00:08:50,581 --> 00:08:51,060
I don't like the,

324
00:08:51,060 --> 00:08:51,690
I like this.

325
00:08:51,690 --> 00:08:52,680
I like a scent.

326
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:55,620
I literally like you like
you're like a machine.

327
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:56,993
I like them.

328
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:00,900
I telling you like I'll tell him the
girl I'm dating you and I like you.

329
00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:02,790
I literally have thrown girlfriends,

330
00:09:02,791 --> 00:09:03,624
deodorants out.

331
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:06,570
I fucking stink a little.

332
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:07,433
Yes,

333
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:11,970
but I have to fucking
the way you're saying it.

334
00:09:12,150 --> 00:09:12,840
Yes,

335
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:13,740
but I have to like them.

336
00:09:13,820 --> 00:09:14,220
Oh,

337
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:15,090
it has to be a key.

338
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:17,460
It's a chemistry thing that's nature
telling you who you should fucking who you

339
00:09:17,461 --> 00:09:18,010
shouldn't fuck.

340
00:09:18,010 --> 00:09:21,300
Cause some people sent repulses me the
smell of their mouth are the smaller

341
00:09:21,301 --> 00:09:24,660
their skin repulses me
unhealthy people probably.

342
00:09:24,870 --> 00:09:27,120
Or even people that I'm just
not meant to breed with.

343
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:28,380
But then there's some people,

344
00:09:28,381 --> 00:09:29,250
the underarm smell,

345
00:09:29,251 --> 00:09:29,620
the smell,

346
00:09:29,620 --> 00:09:30,900
their feet when they're stinky.

347
00:09:31,860 --> 00:09:32,161
Dude,

348
00:09:32,161 --> 00:09:33,510
it makes me not dirty.

349
00:09:33,690 --> 00:09:34,511
I don't like dirty feet.

350
00:09:34,511 --> 00:09:37,770
Like I don't want you to talk a little
stinky in socks and sneakers because it's

351
00:09:37,771 --> 00:09:38,604
clean.

352
00:09:39,570 --> 00:09:40,830
There's a whole fucking thing of it.

353
00:09:46,030 --> 00:09:49,000
[inaudible].
