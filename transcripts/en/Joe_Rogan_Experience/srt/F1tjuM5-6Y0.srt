1
00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:05,070
Is this static?
I'm hearing just in the headphones.

2
00:00:06,370 --> 00:00:08,040
You heard something?
Yeah,

3
00:00:08,041 --> 00:00:08,874
but it's gone now.
I think live and work and we're lying 

4
00:00:14,730 --> 00:00:15,563
for happy motherfucking new year.
Remember when we used to think that the 

5
00:00:18,931 --> 00:00:19,980
world's going to end?
Well,

6
00:00:19,981 --> 00:00:23,610
I used to think that the world was gonna
end and even have the license plate.

7
00:00:24,330 --> 00:00:29,280
I did a 2012 license plate.
I was convinced I was like those Mayans,

8
00:00:29,281 --> 00:00:30,114
man.
They knew it.

9
00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:32,460
I thought it was a real,
for sure.

10
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:35,100
The computer thing.
Remember the Y Two k?

11
00:00:35,430 --> 00:00:36,690
Yeah,
I thought that too.

12
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:39,090
Yeah.
I stayed home for y two k paranoid.

13
00:00:39,630 --> 00:00:42,810
I was to the clock rolled over planes 
falling from the sky.

14
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:45,630
Yeah.
Everybody's worried about the whole grid

15
00:00:45,631 --> 00:00:46,620
shutting down.
Right.

16
00:00:46,621 --> 00:00:47,454
And they wouldn't be able to get it up 
for months and people would run out of 

17
00:00:49,681 --> 00:00:50,514
food.
I was listening to art bell a lot back 

18
00:00:52,171 --> 00:00:53,004
then.

19
00:00:53,580 --> 00:00:54,413
Oh,
cheers.

20
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:55,253
Cheers.
[inaudible] New Year.

21
00:00:55,290 --> 00:00:57,450
Happy eight years.
Eight years of episodes.

22
00:00:58,710 --> 00:00:59,543
Eight years of episodes,
2018 2018 doesn't sound like a real 

23
00:01:05,161 --> 00:01:06,540
number.
It's one of those numbers.

24
00:01:06,541 --> 00:01:08,830
You say it and you go,
Yup.

25
00:01:09,220 --> 00:01:10,053
I guess I guess you're right like 2018 
that's like way too close to 2020 which 

26
00:01:15,451 --> 00:01:17,460
is like space.
That's like the future.

27
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:21,210
It's like a movie you don't like alien.
Like what was,

28
00:01:21,270 --> 00:01:22,103
when you watched the first alien one 
with sigourney weaver from the late 

29
00:01:26,670 --> 00:01:31,610
seventies it was like 1979 what do you 
think the timeline was supposed to be?

30
00:01:31,620 --> 00:01:32,453
It's probably 2001 you know,
cause there's like a lot of movies like 

31
00:01:36,621 --> 00:01:40,740
I think blade runner was something like 
2017 or something like that.

32
00:01:40,770 --> 00:01:42,510
I want to say,
I don't remember,

33
00:01:42,511 --> 00:01:45,170
but I want to say blade runner was like 
2030 or so.

34
00:01:45,171 --> 00:01:48,360
It wasn't that there was all the flying 
cars and shit.

35
00:01:48,390 --> 00:01:51,840
Remember weren't there flying cars or am
I thinking of Fifth Element?

36
00:01:52,070 --> 00:01:52,351
No,
no,

37
00:01:52,351 --> 00:01:53,184
there was flying cars.
Cause I remember the car is going 

38
00:01:54,421 --> 00:01:55,254
through like the cool billboards and 
stuff and I think I confused my Scifi 

39
00:02:00,181 --> 00:02:01,014
movies a lot.
Like old ones played renters 2018 2019 

40
00:02:05,370 --> 00:02:07,020
oh my God,
that's insane.

41
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:10,710
That's a year from now.
That's wow.

42
00:02:10,740 --> 00:02:13,710
That's weird.
That shows how slow it actually is.

43
00:02:13,711 --> 00:02:16,320
Technology thinks it's,
you think it's fast.

44
00:02:16,350 --> 00:02:19,260
It shows how bad movie writers are 
guessing.

45
00:02:19,530 --> 00:02:21,110
I don't think it shows anything else.
Right.

46
00:02:22,470 --> 00:02:27,290
I think the guy who's been the best at 
predicting shit was like wasn't hg wells

47
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:30,030
really good.
I feel like hg wells,

48
00:02:30,031 --> 00:02:30,864
the science fiction author from,
I think he was from the 18 hundreds hg 

49
00:02:35,761 --> 00:02:38,160
wells,
but I think he predicted a lot of shit.

50
00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:40,050
Yeah.
There's a couple articles about all this

51
00:02:40,051 --> 00:02:41,160
stuff you predicted.
Oh really?

52
00:02:41,250 --> 00:02:42,083
Yeah.
The many futuristic predictions of Hg 

53
00:02:45,931 --> 00:02:46,920
wells.
It came true.

54
00:02:46,980 --> 00:02:48,210
All right.
Let's see what we got here.

55
00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:53,070
What did he do or 150 years ago,
phones,

56
00:02:53,071 --> 00:02:57,450
email and television.
What is that real in men like gods?

57
00:02:57,451 --> 00:02:59,980
In 1923 wells invites

58
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:03,010
readers to a futuristic utopia that's 
essentially earth.

59
00:03:03,011 --> 00:03:06,700
After thousands of years of progress in 
this alternate reality,

60
00:03:07,300 --> 00:03:08,133
people communicate exclusively with 
wireless systems that employ a kind of 

61
00:03:11,891 --> 00:03:15,280
commingling of voicemail and email like 
properties.

62
00:03:15,430 --> 00:03:16,263
Holy Shit,
for an utopia except by previous 

63
00:03:21,071 --> 00:03:21,904
arrangement.
People do not talk together on the 

64
00:03:24,401 --> 00:03:25,750
telephone.
He writes,

65
00:03:25,990 --> 00:03:30,990
a message is sent to the station of the 
district in which the recipient is known

66
00:03:31,781 --> 00:03:32,614
to be.
And there it waits until he chooses to 

67
00:03:34,601 --> 00:03:38,700
tap his accumulated messages.
Whoa.

68
00:03:39,650 --> 00:03:43,990
And any that one wishes to repeat can be
repeated.

69
00:03:44,710 --> 00:03:47,740
Then he talks back to the senders in 
dispatches.

70
00:03:47,741 --> 00:03:49,630
Any other messages he wishes

71
00:03:50,550 --> 00:03:53,670
the transmission is wireless.
Wow.

72
00:03:55,260 --> 00:03:58,380
What I'd like to know if he did drugs 
back then,

73
00:03:58,381 --> 00:04:00,810
like if he was doing mushrooms and yeah,
man,

74
00:04:00,811 --> 00:04:01,830
I want to know.

75
00:04:03,230 --> 00:04:06,100
He also imagined forms of true 
entertainment.

76
00:04:06,550 --> 00:04:07,383
Uh,
it says in when the sleeper wakes from 

77
00:04:09,101 --> 00:04:09,934
1899,
the protagonist rouses from two 

78
00:04:12,431 --> 00:04:13,264
centuries of slumber to a dystopian 
London in which citizens used wondrous 

79
00:04:17,290 --> 00:04:20,880
forms of technology like the audio book,
Air,

80
00:04:20,881 --> 00:04:22,930
plane,
and television,

81
00:04:23,230 --> 00:04:28,230
yet suffers systematic oppression and 
social injustice.

82
00:04:28,780 --> 00:04:30,190
What in the fuck

83
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:35,240
man,
what the fuck hg wells lasers to?

84
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:40,230
How's he so good?
It's probably mushrooms.

85
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:41,613
I mean,
we'll think of something that hasn't 

86
00:04:42,661 --> 00:04:46,010
been invented in a hundred years now.
What would you invent like me?

87
00:04:46,170 --> 00:04:46,770
Well,
you know what,

88
00:04:46,770 --> 00:04:50,310
here's our problem.
It's,

89
00:04:50,311 --> 00:04:55,311
I think it's almost impossible once you 
know something exists to imagine a world

90
00:04:55,351 --> 00:04:56,184
in which it didn't exist.
So you and I are unique because we're 

91
00:04:59,221 --> 00:05:02,490
old as fuck.
I'm older as fucker than you.

92
00:05:02,820 --> 00:05:04,950
But we remember when there was no 
internet.

93
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:06,593
I think we're the last of the people 
that are going to remember what life is 

94
00:05:10,231 --> 00:05:13,170
like when there's no internet.
Yeah.

95
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:14,633
And what's next?
What's the thing that hasn't been 

96
00:05:15,871 --> 00:05:19,140
invented that we'll remember?
We saw the first stuff like vr.

97
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:22,770
Good question.
Having glasses always being well I think

98
00:05:22,771 --> 00:05:23,010
that

99
00:05:23,010 --> 00:05:23,843
magic leap shit that you know that 
you've seen that new headset that they 

100
00:05:26,461 --> 00:05:27,294
uh,
are saying they're going to eventually 

101
00:05:28,561 --> 00:05:29,394
wind up selling.
You have like a hip pack and you wear 

102
00:05:30,991 --> 00:05:31,830
these goggles.

103
00:05:31,900 --> 00:05:35,600
[inaudible] dude,
that seems like step one to me.

104
00:05:36,590 --> 00:05:40,910
Apple is putting all their money in ar 
instead of Vr for that reason.

105
00:05:40,911 --> 00:05:41,840
Right.
That's what this is,

106
00:05:41,841 --> 00:05:45,020
right?
This looks like blade runner.

107
00:05:45,350 --> 00:05:46,183
Yeah.
Maybe that movie's not so far off the 

108
00:05:48,801 --> 00:05:50,090
uh,
the one from Columbus,

109
00:05:50,091 --> 00:05:51,780
Ohio blade runner.
Oh.

110
00:05:51,860 --> 00:05:53,810
Like maybe they're only off by a year or
ready player.

111
00:05:53,811 --> 00:05:54,650
One ready player.
One.

112
00:05:54,651 --> 00:05:56,810
Have you seen the preview for that?
That's pretty much,

113
00:05:56,811 --> 00:06:00,380
this is exact same thing as right here,
but this is the Microsoft one.

114
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:03,380
What does the differences,
magic leap movie.

115
00:06:03,590 --> 00:06:05,240
So magically Biz,
not Microsoft.

116
00:06:05,241 --> 00:06:07,040
Which one's the Microsoft one?
Uh,

117
00:06:07,041 --> 00:06:09,560
that would be hololens.
Magic leap is the one that's in Florida.

118
00:06:09,561 --> 00:06:10,394
They went way away from everybody else 
so that they're not getting their 

119
00:06:13,300 --> 00:06:14,133
knology compromised by it.
And these are the ones where they had 

120
00:06:17,271 --> 00:06:20,060
that little a dancer.
The dances on your hand.

121
00:06:20,090 --> 00:06:20,930
Oh,
okay.

122
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:25,340
So this is the really intense lifelike 
augmented reality.

123
00:06:25,790 --> 00:06:27,200
Nobody knew what it was going to look 
like.

124
00:06:27,260 --> 00:06:28,093
They thought any prototype had a big 
giant backpack on and they finally got 

125
00:06:31,281 --> 00:06:32,114
it down to this little pocket.
This is the first time we're actually 

126
00:06:33,351 --> 00:06:36,140
seeing with this also might not be the 
final version.

127
00:06:36,290 --> 00:06:38,060
It could be smaller.
Could be a little bigger.

128
00:06:38,430 --> 00:06:39,740
Exactly.
Looks cool.

129
00:06:40,610 --> 00:06:43,430
It looks very cool.
It looks like Superhero.

130
00:06:43,431 --> 00:06:45,430
Cool.
But the thing is,

131
00:06:45,431 --> 00:06:48,170
is it,
it's so obvious that you're wearing it.

132
00:06:49,020 --> 00:06:49,853
Yeah.
They need to get rid of that part and 

133
00:06:51,261 --> 00:06:52,094
integrate it into the headset.
There's like this hip part like 

134
00:06:54,300 --> 00:06:56,430
batteries plus to wear it in public at 
least this,

135
00:06:56,431 --> 00:06:58,790
this is probably like a home work type 
thing,

136
00:07:00,210 --> 00:07:01,910
like wherever you'd use a personal 
computer.

137
00:07:02,090 --> 00:07:05,870
I feel like we're looking at the seed of
a future thing that's going to eat us.

138
00:07:08,710 --> 00:07:10,190
I'm looking at that.
I'm like that.

139
00:07:11,150 --> 00:07:16,150
That is exactly how it starts.
The electronics cling to the outside and

140
00:07:17,751 --> 00:07:18,584
become inseparable and then slowly they 
work their way into the organism itself 

141
00:07:22,490 --> 00:07:23,323
to the inside.
The organism will accept symbiosis as 

142
00:07:25,851 --> 00:07:28,580
long as the electronics stay on the 
outside,

143
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:30,193
but if it goes inside,
like if the only way you use your cell 

144
00:07:31,881 --> 00:07:35,190
phone was a stick it in your ass.
Right.

145
00:07:35,220 --> 00:07:36,053
There's the only way it works.
We have a new cell phone and it works 

146
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:40,393
all you have to just stick it in your 
ass and then just carry it around with 

147
00:07:42,111 --> 00:07:44,960
you and you make calls with your mind 
and it's a flip.

148
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:46,250
Yeah.
We would say,

149
00:07:46,251 --> 00:07:47,084
no way we can't do it,
but as long as the electronics from the 

150
00:07:50,781 --> 00:07:51,790
outside,
like I said,

151
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:53,180
dude,
they're going to give you a helmet.

152
00:07:53,210 --> 00:07:55,430
You get to the electronics going to go 
right into your eyes.

153
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:56,930
You're gonna see some shit that's not 
there.

154
00:07:56,931 --> 00:07:57,764
You're like,
okay,

155
00:07:58,100 --> 00:08:00,780
where bolt clothing's a tech is the 
future.

156
00:08:00,781 --> 00:08:01,614
Like there's even,
I think Levi's and Microsoft or google 

157
00:08:03,980 --> 00:08:06,560
teamed up and they're,
they're trying to do at jacket,

158
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:07,753
like a tech Jagger.
We just look at your jacket and read 

159
00:08:09,171 --> 00:08:10,004
text and stuff off the sleeve and stuff.
Imagine having a like a shirt and going 

160
00:08:14,271 --> 00:08:15,890
like,
today I want a purple shirt today.

161
00:08:15,891 --> 00:08:16,724
I went to blue shirt.
Or you're getting text messages pop up 

162
00:08:18,861 --> 00:08:21,110
on your shirt.
Or if there's a lost child,

163
00:08:21,111 --> 00:08:23,030
the child's face is on everybody's 
shirt.

164
00:08:23,060 --> 00:08:23,893
Fuck.
I think wearable clothings going to be 

165
00:08:27,470 --> 00:08:29,000
pretty big sin.
Yeah.

166
00:08:29,001 --> 00:08:32,600
Especially if you could like,
if you could get your arm,

167
00:08:32,630 --> 00:08:37,070
like it actually could open up like 
where it looks like a screen.

168
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:38,153
Yeah.
Where if we can get that good where 

169
00:08:40,011 --> 00:08:40,844
there's no benefit like,
and nobody wants a cell phone with a 

170
00:08:42,861 --> 00:08:44,330
shitty screen.
Right,

171
00:08:44,420 --> 00:08:45,260
right.
Yeah.

172
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:46,333
Because like that,
isn't that like the big debate now they 

173
00:08:49,641 --> 00:08:51,530
all look amazing to me because I'm going
blind.

174
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:52,633
Barely.
See.

175
00:08:52,820 --> 00:08:56,160
But the,
if I look at like the x

176
00:08:56,400 --> 00:09:01,400
versus the Google Pixel,
two xl versus they all look really good.

177
00:09:02,370 --> 00:09:04,470
Yeah.
It's more like brightness now to me it's

178
00:09:04,471 --> 00:09:04,681
like,
oh,

179
00:09:04,681 --> 00:09:05,640
this one,
it seems brighter.

180
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:08,220
I guess they all look really good.
They all look amazing.

181
00:09:08,221 --> 00:09:09,980
I mean we're really nitpick and which is
good.

182
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:10,833
Just shows you how good things are.
But could you ever reproduce that on 

183
00:09:12,541 --> 00:09:13,890
your sleeve?
Yeah,

184
00:09:13,980 --> 00:09:15,540
they already have that.
Perfect.

185
00:09:15,570 --> 00:09:18,570
Well like,
like the technology is not 100% there,

186
00:09:18,571 --> 00:09:21,030
but they already have bendable lcds.
Right.

187
00:09:21,031 --> 00:09:21,864
And like stuff like that.
But the thing is having it feel like 

188
00:09:24,091 --> 00:09:27,000
clothing and of like this big chunk 
that's on your shirt,

189
00:09:27,030 --> 00:09:30,660
like these things you see at the mall.
But I like,

190
00:09:30,661 --> 00:09:31,610
I had this,
uh,

191
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:35,460
I was talking to Gino speed,
we'd about this and the idea of having a

192
00:09:35,461 --> 00:09:36,294
hat.
Imagine the hat where you can have any 

193
00:09:38,221 --> 00:09:40,590
logo you want under your hat.
You could change at any day.

194
00:09:40,620 --> 00:09:44,340
And then you can also have it so it's 
just moves or something.

195
00:09:44,341 --> 00:09:47,550
Like if it's the Nike swoosh you see 
like the smoke coming out of the,

196
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:49,550
you know,
how cool would that be just,

197
00:09:49,890 --> 00:09:50,723
and it's weird that we don't see that as
a normal thing yet cause it seems like 

198
00:09:54,601 --> 00:09:56,730
that's already there.
You could do that hat right now.

199
00:09:56,731 --> 00:10:00,000
Probably have a little three g 
connection so you can download things on

200
00:10:00,001 --> 00:10:00,271
it.
You know,

201
00:10:00,271 --> 00:10:02,670
using the little thing on the top of the
hat.

202
00:10:02,940 --> 00:10:06,300
Yeah you probably could button,
you probably could.

203
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:07,913
I mean what,
anything that you can imagine in the 

204
00:10:09,751 --> 00:10:12,720
future is probably going to be possible.
Like anything,

205
00:10:13,110 --> 00:10:13,943
anything you could imagine.
I don't think there's are going to be a 

206
00:10:16,501 --> 00:10:17,334
time in our lifetime we're,
we're change is going to happen as 

207
00:10:21,391 --> 00:10:22,800
quickly as it's happening now.

208
00:10:24,470 --> 00:10:26,030
What about shoes?
Where,

209
00:10:26,630 --> 00:10:29,060
where you could just have like instead 
of walking your shoes,

210
00:10:29,061 --> 00:10:32,510
just roll in Aleks like kind of lied 
along wide.

211
00:10:32,570 --> 00:10:33,820
Yeah.
Well isn't that

212
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:36,150
WHO's always goofing around about the 
aliens?

213
00:10:36,660 --> 00:10:40,920
The aliens are,
is what we imagined as us in the future.

214
00:10:41,670 --> 00:10:44,340
Maybe that's what they really are.
Maybe that they're time travelers.

215
00:10:44,970 --> 00:10:45,803
Cause if he had to think,
like if you go back and look at ancient 

216
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:51,833
like Australia pithy gets you ever see 
like a depiction of Australia pivotus 

217
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:57,113
it's like this weird sorta half human 
monkey things like one of the first 

218
00:11:00,271 --> 00:11:01,104
people.
And if you go back and look at that and 

219
00:11:03,421 --> 00:11:06,810
then you look at a regular person today,
that may be,

220
00:11:06,811 --> 00:11:09,490
you know,
it takes a spin class and you know,

221
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:11,670
go see if they go to the one where he's 
standing up,

222
00:11:13,380 --> 00:11:15,690
there's some pictures of what they think
they would have looked like.

223
00:11:16,510 --> 00:11:19,270
It's weird because there is people that 
look kind of like these people.

224
00:11:19,450 --> 00:11:20,283
You sure?
Yeah.

225
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:24,610
Some people that are pretty hairy too.
I mean they think there's,

226
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:26,860
there's all sorts of different kinds of 
people too.

227
00:11:26,861 --> 00:11:27,694
That's another thing that we forget.
There was a bunch of different kinds of 

228
00:11:29,681 --> 00:11:30,514
people that died off.
But the idea is all these people write 

229
00:11:34,691 --> 00:11:38,200
all these different kinds of little 
people.

230
00:11:38,350 --> 00:11:43,180
They eventually evolve to be human,
right?

231
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:45,760
If they stay alive,
they get to a point.

232
00:11:45,761 --> 00:11:46,594
Well,
what happens if you pass the human 

233
00:11:47,651 --> 00:11:49,930
thing?
Do you just stop at human?

234
00:11:49,931 --> 00:11:52,480
I don't think you could stop it human 
when this is not perfect.

235
00:11:53,050 --> 00:11:55,240
This is not perfect.
This is better.

236
00:11:55,270 --> 00:11:56,440
It's better than it,
you know,

237
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:59,440
killing each other with rocks in the 
trees.

238
00:11:59,590 --> 00:12:01,660
It's better than that,
but it's definitely,

239
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:02,553
we're getting better at this.
It's obvious we're getting better at 

240
00:12:04,841 --> 00:12:09,460
being people collectively.
So like where does it go?

241
00:12:09,461 --> 00:12:10,294
Does it go to,
we just move everything with our brains 

242
00:12:12,311 --> 00:12:13,144
and our heads or that big robot and we 
fuck up the environment so bad that we 

243
00:12:16,601 --> 00:12:18,910
need sunglasses permanently on the 
outside.

244
00:12:18,910 --> 00:12:20,730
And that's what those alien,
the black eyes.

245
00:12:20,731 --> 00:12:22,720
So we just fixed it.
We just give you a fake lens.

246
00:12:23,410 --> 00:12:26,980
Your skin's like bulletproof and you 
move everything into your brain.

247
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:30,250
Nobody needs a mouth anymore.
No sex organs.

248
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:31,113
It got too complicated gender.
This is the year like this is the 

249
00:12:34,421 --> 00:12:35,254
machines confused us and got us to the 
point where they could deliver orgasms 

250
00:12:41,621 --> 00:12:44,740
through like little little injections in
the back of your brain.

251
00:12:45,190 --> 00:12:46,023
You just give way more intense orgasms 
and you would ever get jerking off or 

252
00:12:49,421 --> 00:12:52,540
having sex.
And so everybody just stopped having sex

253
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:55,630
and you're our dicks and vaginas just 
shy.

254
00:12:56,380 --> 00:12:57,213
They just sealed up.
We figured out food to the point where 

255
00:12:59,890 --> 00:13:04,890
now there's no more waste,
so no one has has to shit.

256
00:13:05,670 --> 00:13:08,280
We just nailed it.
That's perfect balance.

257
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:09,740
No one's ever overweight.

258
00:13:10,060 --> 00:13:10,893
It's how they have sex and demolition.
They put those headsets on and sit 

259
00:13:13,311 --> 00:13:14,690
across from each other.
Oh yeah.

260
00:13:14,691 --> 00:13:18,620
They had their feet in the water.
It's not water.

261
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:19,750
It looks like water.
Yeah.

262
00:13:19,850 --> 00:13:23,840
It's where they'd girl drips into.
That's so strange.

263
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:25,130
That's how they had sex.

264
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:27,050
You know?
That's probably going to be better.

265
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:30,980
We gave it this physical thing.
We gave it a shot.

266
00:13:31,130 --> 00:13:31,650
It's too costly.

267
00:13:31,650 --> 00:13:33,840
Okay.
Did the food thing makes the most sense?

268
00:13:33,841 --> 00:13:34,674
Because we are probably going to run out
of food in having like the future of 

269
00:13:37,471 --> 00:13:38,304
food is going to be really weird where 
it's just going to be like almost like 

270
00:13:40,381 --> 00:13:41,850
a,
a break.

271
00:13:41,910 --> 00:13:44,190
Like I vitamin,
well there's my steak,

272
00:13:44,580 --> 00:13:45,413
you know?
There's,

273
00:13:46,060 --> 00:13:46,990
yeah man.
Right.

274
00:13:47,650 --> 00:13:48,970
The future of food.

275
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:50,520
Yeah.

276
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:52,170
Like when they're,
you know,

277
00:13:52,290 --> 00:13:53,123
there was some article it real recent,
like I think maybe even today that was 

278
00:13:56,791 --> 00:13:58,260
talking about,
um,

279
00:13:58,920 --> 00:13:59,753
their progress and synthetic meat.
It'd be able to just make meat and 

280
00:14:03,241 --> 00:14:06,600
laboratory,
which is rule.

281
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:08,340
That's a game changer.

282
00:14:08,830 --> 00:14:10,300
Don't they already have it where you can
buy it.

283
00:14:10,301 --> 00:14:11,134
Now I feel like I was gonna bring this 
up the other day when you talked about 

284
00:14:14,170 --> 00:14:15,790
fat Burger has the impossible burger.

285
00:14:17,060 --> 00:14:18,560
Oh,
but that's some plant based meat.

286
00:14:18,590 --> 00:14:19,423
Yeah,
that's,

287
00:14:19,550 --> 00:14:21,110
but that's dinner lab mate.
No,

288
00:14:21,111 --> 00:14:21,944
no,
no.

289
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:24,830
That's some,
they've had those for a while.

290
00:14:25,450 --> 00:14:26,283
Um,
people who are Vegan who used to like 

291
00:14:29,241 --> 00:14:31,700
cheeseburgers apparently say that this 
works.

292
00:14:31,730 --> 00:14:32,930
Yeah.
That you could,

293
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:34,250
you can literally,
they,

294
00:14:34,251 --> 00:14:36,740
they've looked,
but there's some smart people out there.

295
00:14:36,830 --> 00:14:37,663
They figured out a way to make things 
taste different than what they really 

296
00:14:39,411 --> 00:14:40,244
are.
There's a bunch of Vegan cheeses and 

297
00:14:42,651 --> 00:14:46,640
shit that are really good,
but that's not what I'm talking about.

298
00:14:46,670 --> 00:14:47,503
I'm talking about lab created meet 
actual meat that somehow or another 

299
00:14:52,161 --> 00:14:52,994
they,
they have some cloning process or 

300
00:14:54,081 --> 00:14:54,840
something.

301
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:55,673
Yeah.
I saw something about the other day and 

302
00:14:57,050 --> 00:14:59,760
they're pretty much there if not 
completed with it.

303
00:15:00,850 --> 00:15:01,683
I Dunno.

304
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:04,530
That's the,
if they can do that,

305
00:15:04,531 --> 00:15:06,450
that's fine.
If it tastes the same,

306
00:15:06,451 --> 00:15:08,060
I would go with lab created me.
Yeah,

307
00:15:08,220 --> 00:15:11,610
lab created meat.
It's probably better for you.

308
00:15:14,340 --> 00:15:15,240
Geez.
I just,

309
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:21,600
I'm just imagining like,
you know what I'm imagining power outage

310
00:15:23,130 --> 00:15:27,720
warehouse filled with lab created meat 
stuck in the pipes.

311
00:15:29,590 --> 00:15:30,423
Oh,

312
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:34,460
do you think the expiration date is on a
lab created meat forever?

313
00:15:34,730 --> 00:15:35,563
Yeah,
they just engineer it with the right 

314
00:15:36,471 --> 00:15:39,080
bacteria so I could stay on the shelf 
and definitely,

315
00:15:39,590 --> 00:15:40,423
I remember making a mistake that the 
first time that grocery store I had 

316
00:15:42,441 --> 00:15:45,470
these things called the complete meals.
I don't know what the fuck it's called,

317
00:15:45,471 --> 00:15:49,400
but there's like meat,
like a biscuits and gravy but not in the

318
00:15:49,401 --> 00:15:51,020
cold section.
Not In the hot section.

319
00:15:51,021 --> 00:15:51,854
And you barely had to heat it up.
It was just kind of ready to go meals 

320
00:15:54,610 --> 00:15:55,443
and my friend ate it.
But I think we both got sick as fuck 

321
00:15:56,991 --> 00:15:57,860
this.
So disgusting.

322
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:02,600
But I mean they're still out there.
This was seven years ago.

323
00:16:03,710 --> 00:16:07,310
It's like those little meals for kids 
that aren't really food.

324
00:16:07,370 --> 00:16:09,470
What's his little lunchables?
Lunchables.

325
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:12,620
Those things are the worst for people.
That's not even food.

326
00:16:12,790 --> 00:16:14,170
Yeah.
Those little cheese things.

327
00:16:14,171 --> 00:16:15,760
He's take a cracker in.
Yeah.

328
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:20,890
Oh yeah.
Oh those are so gross.

329
00:16:21,430 --> 00:16:22,460
Some of them.
Some,

330
00:16:22,470 --> 00:16:23,890
some.
Somebody must have a good one.

331
00:16:24,130 --> 00:16:24,963
Bye now.
Good little like starbucks has like a 

332
00:16:28,121 --> 00:16:30,250
decent little snack pack,
right?

333
00:16:30,251 --> 00:16:32,860
Don't they have one with like celery and
beets and shit?

334
00:16:33,570 --> 00:16:34,171
Sure.
Yeah.

335
00:16:34,171 --> 00:16:36,420
They have all this stuff.
Starbucks is pretty good.

336
00:16:36,750 --> 00:16:39,060
AMC movie theaters has waffles and 
chicken now.

337
00:16:39,061 --> 00:16:39,894
Did you know that?

338
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:41,033
That's amazing.
But I think the healthy option thing is 

339
00:16:44,311 --> 00:16:46,260
because people demand it.
Right?

340
00:16:46,261 --> 00:16:47,094
Cause there's a bit,
why wouldn't they have it is like 

341
00:16:48,001 --> 00:16:49,080
there's,
there's money in it.

342
00:16:49,110 --> 00:16:49,943
Yeah.
If you go to starbucks sometimes if 

343
00:16:51,121 --> 00:16:54,000
you're trying to not taking too much 
sugar or something like that,

344
00:16:54,001 --> 00:16:55,320
you look at all that stuff and you're 
like,

345
00:16:55,321 --> 00:16:57,300
God damn it.
It's gotta be something in here for me.

346
00:16:57,450 --> 00:16:58,283
What's your for me?
Like you got all your tasty I site 

347
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:02,580
options.
Right?

348
00:17:02,610 --> 00:17:04,140
Like those cake pops.
I'm like,

349
00:17:04,170 --> 00:17:05,003
damn,
I just go off the reservation and get a 

350
00:17:06,151 --> 00:17:07,950
fucking cake pop.
Right.

351
00:17:08,250 --> 00:17:10,290
It's like weird.
Like they're really,

352
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:13,860
they're selling sugar just as much as 
they're selling coffee,

353
00:17:14,010 --> 00:17:16,590
which is great.
Have you had the Bantam bagels,

354
00:17:16,620 --> 00:17:20,580
the Bagel balls or they're amazing.
They're amazing.

355
00:17:21,420 --> 00:17:22,253
They,
I used to like their chocolate 

356
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:28,160
croissants but then I found um,
the coffee beans,

357
00:17:28,711 --> 00:17:31,320
chocolate croissants to be more 
delectable.

358
00:17:32,220 --> 00:17:35,520
So if I was going to go off,
I go to the coffee bean.

359
00:17:36,630 --> 00:17:37,820
Don't mess with that.
I don't,

360
00:17:37,830 --> 00:17:39,470
don't mess with starbucks.
I just got it.

361
00:17:39,471 --> 00:17:42,060
You have a relationship at starbucks?
It's just right next door.

362
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:44,153
Every time I get a coffee bean though,
when you get used to certain tastes of 

363
00:17:46,351 --> 00:17:48,540
coffee,
even if the coffee is better,

364
00:17:48,660 --> 00:17:49,493
it's really to go like,
that's not an ice coffee in my head in 

365
00:17:52,111 --> 00:17:53,220
ice coffee,
starbucks,

366
00:17:53,221 --> 00:17:55,470
iced coffee.
This is just like some other bullshit.

367
00:17:55,860 --> 00:17:59,940
Like I went to Denny's the other day,
maybe the best coffee I've had in a long

368
00:17:59,941 --> 00:18:03,210
time and you can't buy that anywhere.
You have to go to denny's.

369
00:18:03,660 --> 00:18:05,530
Yeah.
They don't sell you denny's coffin.

370
00:18:05,970 --> 00:18:07,560
I was looking for a k cup for it,
you know,

371
00:18:07,561 --> 00:18:09,410
they look correct.
Cups speaking

372
00:18:10,590 --> 00:18:11,423
Denny's is a,
that's probably like the biggest 

373
00:18:14,730 --> 00:18:16,830
breakfast chain ever,
right?

374
00:18:17,070 --> 00:18:18,060
Yeah,
it's gotta be,

375
00:18:18,061 --> 00:18:20,220
it's like I hop and Dennis,
those are the two

376
00:18:21,830 --> 00:18:24,090
you could have.
There's like a standard you like,

377
00:18:24,210 --> 00:18:27,270
there's a balance between how delicious 
it is,

378
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:28,553
how cheap it is.
You gotta be real careful with that 

379
00:18:30,121 --> 00:18:31,260
balance.
You know,

380
00:18:31,380 --> 00:18:34,350
like it's a different concept than a 
regular restaurant,

381
00:18:34,770 --> 00:18:38,310
like a regular restaurant.
But it is a regular restaurant,

382
00:18:38,311 --> 00:18:38,941
right?
I mean,

383
00:18:38,941 --> 00:18:42,270
I hops a fucking regular restaurant and 
Burger there the other day,

384
00:18:42,300 --> 00:18:43,740
but even if you eat there,
you like,

385
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:45,310
even if you eat healthy there,
you're like,

386
00:18:45,311 --> 00:18:46,860
oh,
I fucked up with die off.

387
00:18:47,190 --> 00:18:49,350
Right.
Because everything is so delicious.

388
00:18:49,351 --> 00:18:53,040
You look at it whipped cream on top of 
shit and a menu and those marriage,

389
00:18:53,041 --> 00:18:55,680
she know cherries and you're like,
oh Jesus,

390
00:18:55,860 --> 00:18:56,880
this is at Ihub.

391
00:18:57,700 --> 00:18:58,533
Okay.
And then you have that row of syrup 

392
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:03,450
already on your table.
I think I want to add blueberry taste to

393
00:19:03,460 --> 00:19:03,860
it.

394
00:19:03,860 --> 00:19:07,490
If you're gonna just go off ihops the 
spot to go off,

395
00:19:07,580 --> 00:19:08,413
right?
The story.

396
00:19:08,530 --> 00:19:09,363
Yeah.
Yeah.

397
00:19:09,380 --> 00:19:10,213
South Carolina,
man hilariously cooks himself breakfast 

398
00:19:12,381 --> 00:19:16,520
at Waffle House while employees sleeps.
Oh my God.

399
00:19:16,521 --> 00:19:18,160
That's funny.
Yeah,

400
00:19:18,230 --> 00:19:20,840
he's taking pictures.
The guys just asleep in the corner.

401
00:19:20,870 --> 00:19:23,540
Oh my God.
That is hilarious.

402
00:19:24,230 --> 00:19:27,910
That is hilarious.
Oh my God.

403
00:19:27,950 --> 00:19:28,783
Is that illegal?
Could those guys get in trouble for 

404
00:19:30,561 --> 00:19:30,940
that?
Okay.

405
00:19:30,940 --> 00:19:33,490
Maine taking the pictures and 
incriminating yourself?

406
00:19:33,491 --> 00:19:35,800
Probably not the smartest move and 
putting them online,

407
00:19:35,801 --> 00:19:39,790
but probably not.
That's a good question.

408
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:41,140
It's like a no harm,
no foul kind of thing.

409
00:19:41,141 --> 00:19:42,370
I think.
No harm,

410
00:19:42,371 --> 00:19:44,110
no foul.
We got hurt in this situation.

411
00:19:44,230 --> 00:19:46,240
I wonder if he put money down now.
He said he came back.

412
00:19:46,241 --> 00:19:48,310
It says he came back the next day and 
gave a $5 tip.

413
00:19:49,690 --> 00:19:51,070
Wow.
Okay.

414
00:19:54,050 --> 00:19:56,690
One employee working whole waffle house.
What if,

415
00:19:57,050 --> 00:19:59,480
what if like 10 people walk in?
20 people walking.

416
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:02,480
That seems weird.
That seems ridiculous.

417
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:07,200
I hate waffle.
Waffle houses are amazing.

418
00:20:07,230 --> 00:20:09,060
You like Raphael good.
Yeah man.

419
00:20:09,061 --> 00:20:09,894
If you're on the road,
it's like three o'clock in the morning 

420
00:20:11,410 --> 00:20:13,230
until like the greatest things that have
ever existed.

421
00:20:14,860 --> 00:20:15,693
If you're on the road,
like let's pick up some weird spot in 

422
00:20:18,821 --> 00:20:21,550
South Carolina or something like that.
That's exactly where this was.

423
00:20:21,850 --> 00:20:22,960
Ooh.
What's Columbia?

424
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:26,920
Less Cold Sea Jesus that was just out 
there.

425
00:20:27,030 --> 00:20:28,480
Straight up.
Guess

426
00:20:28,940 --> 00:20:31,790
all the waffle house's in Ohio are like 
connected to strip clubs.

427
00:20:31,791 --> 00:20:35,120
So I always considered it being like 
gross food because yeah,

428
00:20:36,050 --> 00:20:36,750
I don't know.

429
00:20:36,750 --> 00:20:37,583
Yeah man,
I,

430
00:20:38,490 --> 00:20:40,470
we probably been about 10 of those on 
the road.

431
00:20:40,471 --> 00:20:43,530
Yeah,
they're always like a good option.

432
00:20:44,250 --> 00:20:45,600
It's also 24 hours,
so,

433
00:20:45,750 --> 00:20:46,680
yeah,
that's right.

434
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:49,720
That's why it's so crazy.
That's why it gets weird.

435
00:20:50,710 --> 00:20:54,500
Waffle houses get weird.
3:00

436
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:59,500
AM New Year's Eve waffle house.
All it takes is one crazy person to walk

437
00:21:00,381 --> 00:21:03,280
in.
Guy Fieri era.

438
00:21:03,281 --> 00:21:06,250
I just had to close his restaurant.
You say that with Glee.

439
00:21:07,390 --> 00:21:09,250
Why do you do that?
No,

440
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:12,190
I just called Miss Ohio native.
We have to,

441
00:21:14,690 --> 00:21:16,870
you've got to support your own.
No,

442
00:21:16,871 --> 00:21:19,930
I'm just saying that that went fast.
You know,

443
00:21:20,230 --> 00:21:22,080
all die theory is a,
um,

444
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:23,440
he's a funny guy.
Yeah.

445
00:21:24,670 --> 00:21:25,180
Okay.

446
00:21:25,180 --> 00:21:27,700
I like how he wearing,
I like people that wear their sunglasses

447
00:21:27,701 --> 00:21:29,920
backwards on their neck.
What you don't want,

448
00:21:29,921 --> 00:21:32,950
I don't get with him is why so many 
people get rick a guest.

449
00:21:32,951 --> 00:21:36,520
They don't like that he spikes his hair.
They don't,

450
00:21:36,521 --> 00:21:39,010
what is it that they don't like?
I think it's just an easy target.

451
00:21:39,011 --> 00:21:42,880
I don't know.
I mean he seems nice.

452
00:21:42,881 --> 00:21:44,260
I met him once.
He was nice.

453
00:21:45,140 --> 00:21:47,080
I don't care if he likes to wear his 
hair like that.

454
00:21:47,260 --> 00:21:49,600
It's like a don king thing.
Am I mad at Don King?

455
00:21:49,750 --> 00:21:51,670
He can't change his look.
That's what he's known for it.

456
00:21:51,671 --> 00:21:52,504
Is it racist as a white guy with blonde 
hair spikes his hair up and people just 

457
00:21:55,511 --> 00:21:57,630
automatically assume you're a Douche.
Is that racist?

458
00:21:57,640 --> 00:21:58,473
Like a nickelback thing?
Like people don't really hate that 

459
00:22:00,181 --> 00:22:01,810
model.
I mean they probably did a little bit,

460
00:22:01,811 --> 00:22:03,770
but I wear my hair like that sometimes.
Yeah.

461
00:22:03,820 --> 00:22:06,430
Billy Corgan,
I don't know if he was trolling or not.

462
00:22:06,610 --> 00:22:07,810
Um,
I don't think he was,

463
00:22:07,900 --> 00:22:08,733
he,
he was talking to me about how good he 

464
00:22:10,571 --> 00:22:11,710
thinks nickelback is.

465
00:22:12,060 --> 00:22:12,893
Oh,

466
00:22:14,300 --> 00:22:16,340
I think nickelback has some fuck good 
songs.

467
00:22:16,670 --> 00:22:17,503
I do what I do.
I know the first day of the main prompt 

468
00:22:20,061 --> 00:22:23,270
people had little man.
I listen,

469
00:22:23,271 --> 00:22:27,440
I enjoy the way that a rock star song 
sounds.

470
00:22:27,770 --> 00:22:30,350
I know that's sort of a,
a song that's been covered,

471
00:22:30,590 --> 00:22:31,341
you know,
like that's,

472
00:22:31,341 --> 00:22:35,480
that style of song has been covered a 
few times.

473
00:22:35,481 --> 00:22:38,030
Right.
But I liked that one.

474
00:22:38,450 --> 00:22:41,330
I mean I like the Cypress Hill one 
better.

475
00:22:41,610 --> 00:22:44,860
Remember?
So if you want to be a rock star,

476
00:22:45,270 --> 00:22:47,240
you know,
it's the same thing.

477
00:22:49,060 --> 00:22:50,510
It's the same thing.
Yeah.

478
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:52,113
It's the same thing.
It's like there's a style of song of 

479
00:22:55,121 --> 00:22:58,060
like describing what it's the lifestyle 
of a rock star.

480
00:22:58,290 --> 00:22:59,123
So the only problem with the nickelback 
song is that it had been done before 

481
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:02,913
because if it hadn't been done before,
they did a really job covering that 

482
00:23:06,671 --> 00:23:09,430
subject.
Like their,

483
00:23:09,431 --> 00:23:12,070
their take on it was,
was good.

484
00:23:12,100 --> 00:23:15,790
It was very polished,
maybe too polished for some people.

485
00:23:16,580 --> 00:23:20,560
We like Shit Ra.
We like to hear that Janis Joplin growl,

486
00:23:20,620 --> 00:23:21,910
right?
We like to heat here,

487
00:23:21,911 --> 00:23:25,720
amy winehouse.
There's something we like about that raw

488
00:23:25,721 --> 00:23:29,410
shit to so remind us,
remind us.

489
00:23:29,411 --> 00:23:31,810
You're just like us.
That's the problem.

490
00:23:31,811 --> 00:23:32,644
I think some musicians have with 
nickelback there sort of considered at 

491
00:23:35,441 --> 00:23:36,274
least they were and what's called like 
an end the box type of bandwidth for 

492
00:23:39,041 --> 00:23:40,930
recording purposes.
I They Canadian.

493
00:23:41,010 --> 00:23:42,090
Yeah,
that's it.

494
00:23:42,310 --> 00:23:43,990
That's all it is.
So it is,

495
00:23:43,991 --> 00:23:45,770
yeah.
Canadians are so nice.

496
00:23:45,771 --> 00:23:46,010
You don't

497
00:23:46,010 --> 00:23:47,840
believe him did this.
They would record,

498
00:23:47,950 --> 00:23:49,030
uh,
no,

499
00:23:49,090 --> 00:23:50,230
no.
Um,

500
00:23:50,410 --> 00:23:52,600
affects on their sounds on their guitar 
for instance.

501
00:23:52,601 --> 00:23:53,890
No distortion,
no delay.

502
00:23:54,100 --> 00:23:57,310
They'd record literally putting the 
guitar right into this board,

503
00:23:57,311 --> 00:23:58,144
kind of in it record this real weird 
electronic sound that you could 

504
00:24:00,701 --> 00:24:02,650
manipulate completely in pro tools 
later,

505
00:24:03,220 --> 00:24:04,053
changing everything about it.
They were like one of the first bands 

506
00:24:06,581 --> 00:24:08,050
that got popular doing that,
I think.

507
00:24:08,350 --> 00:24:11,500
And so that's sort of like,
I'm sure traditional musicians had a big

508
00:24:11,501 --> 00:24:12,334
problem with it.
Isn't nickelback the band that like 

509
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:16,300
every single one of their songs sound 
exactly the same.

510
00:24:16,301 --> 00:24:17,134
Like whiny

511
00:24:18,210 --> 00:24:21,990
that guy.
It's not whiny.

512
00:24:22,110 --> 00:24:22,560
Well,
it's like,

513
00:24:22,560 --> 00:24:24,810
I wouldn't say whiny.
I'd say it's poppy.

514
00:24:25,050 --> 00:24:30,050
It's like very good pop music.
I mean we'll try and be nice here.

515
00:24:32,820 --> 00:24:35,490
I don't,
I like a lot of their songs,

516
00:24:36,270 --> 00:24:37,103
but I'm trying to be nice here.
Like I understand if people would get 

517
00:24:39,661 --> 00:24:42,270
upset that it's not their style in 
music,

518
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:46,010
you know,
it's people that like like real level.

519
00:24:46,110 --> 00:24:49,650
They'll play something for you.
Like to play the Beatles like

520
00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:50,820
okay,

521
00:24:50,820 --> 00:24:51,653
lucy in the sky with diamonds.
He put on some headphones and listen to 

522
00:24:54,121 --> 00:24:55,260
a loose smoke,
a joint,

523
00:24:55,710 --> 00:24:56,543
put on some headphones and listen to a 
song that was created by the first wave 

524
00:25:04,271 --> 00:25:05,104
of British superstars that came to 
America and they're on acid and the 

525
00:25:10,391 --> 00:25:13,750
saying about lucy in the sky with 
diamonds and it's,

526
00:25:14,020 --> 00:25:17,080
it's amazing.
It's amazing.

527
00:25:20,360 --> 00:25:21,193
Do that.

528
00:25:25,150 --> 00:25:25,983
Okay.

529
00:25:28,070 --> 00:25:29,620
Right now,
do you want us to do it right now?

530
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:34,040
Just thinking I want to,
I want to think about this for a second.

531
00:25:35,370 --> 00:25:36,203
Okay.

532
00:25:37,430 --> 00:25:42,430
Just imagine,
imagine what it was like back then.

533
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:45,713
Imagine,
imagine being in like 1960 whatever the 

534
00:25:50,101 --> 00:25:51,720
fuck it was when all this was going on.

535
00:25:55,550 --> 00:25:59,120
What do you plan the background?
It takes forever.

536
00:25:59,121 --> 00:26:01,610
I thought I was going crazy after my two
stone.

537
00:26:01,611 --> 00:26:02,444
I'm having a dad.
I was listen to led Zeppelin came on 

538
00:26:03,441 --> 00:26:05,120
last night and I forgot.
I don't know how to say the word.

539
00:26:05,121 --> 00:26:06,890
Dear dire maker.
How do you say it?

540
00:26:07,330 --> 00:26:08,660
Yeah,
it's a bad ass song.

541
00:26:08,661 --> 00:26:09,290
I forgot.

542
00:26:09,290 --> 00:26:11,240
Oh Dude.
There's so many good songs.

543
00:26:14,030 --> 00:26:16,850
There's so many good songs now.
This is the thing.

544
00:26:16,910 --> 00:26:20,060
The songs are better.
They're better than nickelback.

545
00:26:20,130 --> 00:26:20,540
Yeah,
right.

546
00:26:20,540 --> 00:26:23,950
It's not mold,
but nick or backs not bad saw that.

547
00:26:23,990 --> 00:26:24,823
It's just,
if you want to compare Jimi Hendrix to 

548
00:26:27,051 --> 00:26:27,884
the rest of the world,
the rest of the world's going to suck a 

549
00:26:29,511 --> 00:26:30,890
fat deck.
This,

550
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:34,370
there was a guy that knew how to do it 
better than everybody else.

551
00:26:34,690 --> 00:26:35,523
It doesn't mean that.
It doesn't mean Eric Clapton wasn't an 

552
00:26:38,301 --> 00:26:42,500
amazing guitarist.
It means everybody always looks at Jimmy

553
00:26:42,500 --> 00:26:45,000
Hendrix in a better way.
For whatever reason,

554
00:26:45,001 --> 00:26:46,200
Matt,
for whatever reason,

555
00:26:46,450 --> 00:26:47,283
you know,
I'm sure there's people that would see 

556
00:26:48,241 --> 00:26:52,100
it the opposite way.
It doesn't mean nickelback socks.

557
00:26:53,300 --> 00:26:54,690
They've gotten your man,
Bro.

558
00:26:57,630 --> 00:27:00,150
Like they just word the Beatles,
you know,

559
00:27:00,260 --> 00:27:01,093
but that's like a,
I guess there's a different category 

560
00:27:02,671 --> 00:27:03,481
between like,
you know,

561
00:27:03,481 --> 00:27:05,820
they Beatles led Zeppelin and Nicole 
Vac,

562
00:27:05,850 --> 00:27:07,410
right?
Maybe there is,

563
00:27:07,411 --> 00:27:10,110
but maybe we should just relax.
I mean,

564
00:27:10,140 --> 00:27:10,973
I'll take two smash mouseover I'm just 
saying maybe we should just relax like 

565
00:27:14,311 --> 00:27:16,590
about everything.
I think we're picking,

566
00:27:16,650 --> 00:27:19,200
we're looking for tribal enemies that 
don't exist,

567
00:27:20,310 --> 00:27:21,930
you know,
just because you like to eat,

568
00:27:22,360 --> 00:27:24,660
you know falafels and,
and you know,

569
00:27:24,661 --> 00:27:26,670
like extra ketchup on your fries and I 
don't,

570
00:27:26,850 --> 00:27:27,683
you know,
or you,

571
00:27:27,700 --> 00:27:30,600
you like to go running and I like to 
take naps.

572
00:27:31,070 --> 00:27:32,340
You know,
who cares?

573
00:27:33,210 --> 00:27:34,043
This is,
this is my perspective in 2018 I think 

574
00:27:36,031 --> 00:27:39,480
the more we can relax that we will have 
less conflict,

575
00:27:39,750 --> 00:27:40,583
interpersonal conflict,
which often fuels extra personal 

576
00:27:43,651 --> 00:27:47,880
conflict.
It's 2018 and let it go.

577
00:27:49,010 --> 00:27:54,010
You can like nickelback I told somebody 
that I like Ellie King and uh,

578
00:27:54,301 --> 00:27:55,920
they gave me like a sidewards face.

579
00:27:56,190 --> 00:27:57,990
I'm like,
fuck you.

580
00:27:58,890 --> 00:28:00,510
I don't even hit that is,
you know who that is?

581
00:28:01,220 --> 00:28:04,060
You ever heard that song x's and o's?
Oh Dude,

582
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:07,800
she's bad ass x isn't her whole album is
bad ass.

583
00:28:08,580 --> 00:28:09,390
What is that?
Uh,

584
00:28:09,390 --> 00:28:11,010
what does that,
that album called,

585
00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:11,993
do you call it an album anymore?
Because it used to be a c it was an 

586
00:28:14,041 --> 00:28:17,040
album and then you were an old man if 
you were calling it an album,

587
00:28:17,041 --> 00:28:17,874
it's a cd Bro.
And then it stopped being a CD and it 

588
00:28:19,921 --> 00:28:22,110
became an album again.
I download it.

589
00:28:22,111 --> 00:28:24,930
I just say I downloaded it.
What do you say?

590
00:28:24,931 --> 00:28:26,930
Do you say you say it's an outlet?
Call it CD.

591
00:28:26,940 --> 00:28:28,350
I still say CTA,
I think.

592
00:28:29,010 --> 00:28:31,020
I don't think I do album.
I mean,

593
00:28:31,130 --> 00:28:34,200
do you remember when people would mock 
you if you said album?

594
00:28:34,230 --> 00:28:35,700
Cause they'd be like,
you mean cd?

595
00:28:36,050 --> 00:28:38,580
It's his cd now called the CD.
Like,

596
00:28:38,610 --> 00:28:39,121
oh,
okay.

597
00:28:39,121 --> 00:28:39,954
Okay.
That was like a phase where people got 

598
00:28:42,090 --> 00:28:42,923
conti about the distinctions between cds
and albums and then all of a sudden 

599
00:28:46,801 --> 00:28:50,250
vinyl made a little comeback during the 
CD era,

600
00:28:50,251 --> 00:28:52,830
people decided that vinyl was a,
how would you describe a Jamie?

601
00:28:52,831 --> 00:28:54,960
What's the,
what's the difference between the sound?

602
00:28:55,020 --> 00:28:55,853
Oh,
it's warmer.

603
00:28:56,100 --> 00:28:58,170
It's got a nice warm,
you always say warmer.

604
00:28:58,470 --> 00:29:01,120
That eight out vinyl is huge now.
So big.

605
00:29:01,710 --> 00:29:02,543
Like I went to a vinyl store the other 
day that was like being in a record 

606
00:29:05,041 --> 00:29:07,290
store in the 70s like I was like,
it was all vinyl.

607
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:08,850
What people are digging it,
man.

608
00:29:08,890 --> 00:29:09,240
They,
they,

609
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:10,073
they get into it.
It's a tactile relationship with the 

610
00:29:12,301 --> 00:29:15,150
music.
That's what Henry Rollins was explaining

611
00:29:15,151 --> 00:29:17,580
it to me.
And the way he describes it,

612
00:29:17,581 --> 00:29:18,414
it's really intoxicating because he's 
such an an an addict to that kind of 

613
00:29:22,291 --> 00:29:23,124
music and he has a whole set up in his 
house where these crazy speakers that 

614
00:29:27,091 --> 00:29:30,990
are like stupid expensive and he has 
this amazing record collection and he'll

615
00:29:30,991 --> 00:29:34,740
just sit there and play his records and 
he does a radio show,

616
00:29:34,770 --> 00:29:36,300
I believe it's once a week.

617
00:29:36,300 --> 00:29:37,133
Is it once a week?
He does a radio show once a week where 

618
00:29:40,591 --> 00:29:44,050
he picks the songs and he plays the 
music.

619
00:29:44,620 --> 00:29:49,120
It's all his selections.
What does it on Kr kcrw.

620
00:29:49,530 --> 00:29:52,300
Here's this great speakers.
Yeah.

621
00:29:52,301 --> 00:29:55,000
So he's got these fucking nutty ass 
speakers,

622
00:29:55,001 --> 00:29:55,834
man.
Look at these things and he stands in 

623
00:29:57,671 --> 00:30:00,920
front of these things and I really 
enjoyed talking to him,

624
00:30:00,921 --> 00:30:04,090
man.
He's an uniquely unusual person.

625
00:30:04,510 --> 00:30:09,510
I always thought he was like,
I am going to be completely honest.

626
00:30:10,450 --> 00:30:14,170
When he was a young guy and he did that,
uh,

627
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:16,420
beavis and butthead thing,
liar.

628
00:30:16,900 --> 00:30:20,110
Do you remember that?
Why it Beavis and butthead?

629
00:30:20,140 --> 00:30:21,520
It was hilarious,
dude.

630
00:30:21,640 --> 00:30:26,110
He had an amazing song called Ama Liar.
You ever seen rollins?

631
00:30:26,950 --> 00:30:27,783
You don't know that song.
There's like one of his breakout hit 

632
00:30:29,441 --> 00:30:32,740
songs as a connected with that and he 
was super jacked.

633
00:30:32,890 --> 00:30:35,110
That was in his full on power lifting 
days.

634
00:30:35,590 --> 00:30:39,910
And I remember seeing him go at this guy
is like way too intense.

635
00:30:40,150 --> 00:30:42,430
How is this a fucking cigarette?
A band.

636
00:30:42,610 --> 00:30:43,443
That guy looks like he wants to rip your
fucking head clean off your body and 

637
00:30:48,161 --> 00:30:50,170
just pull your guts through your neck 
hole.

638
00:30:50,410 --> 00:30:55,120
He looked so crazy scary and uh,
I could never figure it out.

639
00:30:55,121 --> 00:30:57,310
I was like,
that's so weird that this guy is,

640
00:30:57,311 --> 00:30:59,140
um,
I forgot a singer.

641
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:00,033
In my mind,
a singer had to be a certain type of 

642
00:31:01,541 --> 00:31:02,374
person.
They had to be a Jon Bon Jovi or they 

643
00:31:04,691 --> 00:31:06,390
had to be Robert Plant.
They had it,

644
00:31:06,391 --> 00:31:07,224
you know,
there was a style that you could be a 

645
00:31:07,811 --> 00:31:11,450
singer and he was just completely new,
weird thing.

646
00:31:11,451 --> 00:31:14,830
This jacked up power are covered in 
tattoos.

647
00:31:14,831 --> 00:31:15,970
I was like,
whoa.

648
00:31:17,020 --> 00:31:17,853
But when you meet him,
I mean maybe it's cause I'm meeting him 

649
00:31:20,380 --> 00:31:23,620
later in his life when he's mellowed and
matured,

650
00:31:23,770 --> 00:31:27,160
but he is one of the most fascinating 
guys I've ever talked to.

651
00:31:27,490 --> 00:31:30,760
One of the most absolutely unique 
individuals.

652
00:31:30,761 --> 00:31:31,660
Like,
oh,

653
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:32,673
I never met one at you.
The guy is obsessed with productivity 

654
00:31:36,971 --> 00:31:40,490
and work and creating obsessed with it.
His writing,

655
00:31:40,491 --> 00:31:42,520
he writes for like a bunch of different 
publications,

656
00:31:42,730 --> 00:31:44,860
constantly writing,
constantly traveling,

657
00:31:44,861 --> 00:31:46,840
goes to places,
just gets on a plane,

658
00:31:47,380 --> 00:31:51,280
flies over to that spot,
lands with buys water and starts fucking

659
00:31:51,281 --> 00:31:53,710
meeting people.
It doesn't know where the fuck he is.

660
00:31:55,420 --> 00:31:56,253
Just puts himself in these weird 
positions and some of them like super 

661
00:31:59,591 --> 00:32:02,500
dangerous,
fascinating guy,

662
00:32:02,501 --> 00:32:04,570
man.
Never met a guy like him.

663
00:32:04,840 --> 00:32:06,550
I heard him on our,
he's podcast,

664
00:32:07,090 --> 00:32:09,470
one of the,
one of the main um,

665
00:32:10,330 --> 00:32:11,163
podcast that he did that really like 
fucking blew my mind was him describing 

666
00:32:15,341 --> 00:32:18,460
all this travel that he does on Ari show
cause you know,

667
00:32:18,461 --> 00:32:19,870
our,
he's a travel nut too.

668
00:32:20,050 --> 00:32:22,240
So the two of them together,
it's like wow.

669
00:32:23,860 --> 00:32:24,693
I think he probably was one of the 
inspirations or at least help fuel the 

670
00:32:28,061 --> 00:32:30,970
inspiration that Ari had when he already
took off for like four months.

671
00:32:32,710 --> 00:32:36,070
I didn't know he was on Ari's podcast.
That's a good catch for Ari.

672
00:32:36,100 --> 00:32:39,650
It's an amazing episode.
I believe they were in Edinburgh.

673
00:32:40,310 --> 00:32:41,143
I believe they were there for the fringe
festival in Edinburgh and I think that 

674
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:48,360
our was performing and um,
he,

675
00:32:48,500 --> 00:32:50,480
he's going to get mad.
I know he told me this story and I don't

676
00:32:50,481 --> 00:32:53,270
remember it.
You hear a lot of stories though.

677
00:32:53,690 --> 00:32:55,430
I heard too many.
Somehow or another,

678
00:32:55,431 --> 00:32:57,100
someone set it up,
but um,

679
00:32:57,140 --> 00:32:59,900
it's a great podcast nonetheless,
however it transpired.

680
00:33:00,530 --> 00:33:04,310
But Henry Rollins is a,
here it is.

681
00:33:04,520 --> 00:33:08,240
Not all those who wander are lost.
That's exactly what the name is.

682
00:33:09,170 --> 00:33:14,170
Skeptic tank two 77 yeah.
So now awesome podcast.

683
00:33:14,690 --> 00:33:15,950
I mean like a life changer.

684
00:33:16,280 --> 00:33:18,830
Like you listen to that podcast and his,
what?

685
00:33:18,831 --> 00:33:20,660
He gets out of travel,
you go,

686
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:24,350
oh yeah.
Why wasn't I looking at it that way?

687
00:33:25,220 --> 00:33:27,800
Like know why was I just going to places
going up?

688
00:33:27,801 --> 00:33:29,390
Can they drink the water?
Is this safe?

689
00:33:29,500 --> 00:33:30,800
Like what is this?
Okay,

690
00:33:31,310 --> 00:33:33,090
where's he's going over there going,
hell,

691
00:33:33,140 --> 00:33:35,000
what do you do man?
What's going on?

692
00:33:35,240 --> 00:33:35,691
Like,
what do you,

693
00:33:35,691 --> 00:33:37,520
what do you people up to?
He's like,

694
00:33:37,521 --> 00:33:38,354
really?
Like going into uncharted territories 

695
00:33:41,570 --> 00:33:44,090
all the time or on a regular basis,
picks a spot in the map.

696
00:33:44,330 --> 00:33:45,163
Just goes like,
that's one of the things that I've 

697
00:33:48,561 --> 00:33:50,960
always said about Ari.
I like people who just go for it,

698
00:33:51,080 --> 00:33:53,990
you know,
like Ra should fear just goes for it.

699
00:33:54,330 --> 00:33:56,270
It takes you,
goes away for like four months.

700
00:33:56,271 --> 00:33:59,120
He just vanishes.
He goes forward with how he does comedy.

701
00:33:59,400 --> 00:34:00,830
You know,
I'm gonna go do comedy in China,

702
00:34:00,920 --> 00:34:02,090
you know,
he just goes for it.

703
00:34:04,040 --> 00:34:07,670
It'd be funny if when he vanishes,
but he actually has another life that he

704
00:34:07,671 --> 00:34:08,504
doesn't tell anybody about family kids,
the husband didn't he have an entire 

705
00:34:14,031 --> 00:34:14,864
nother life when you guys did a podcast 
together and Ari did Salvia on your 

706
00:34:20,571 --> 00:34:24,260
podcast and he,
the way he described it,

707
00:34:24,280 --> 00:34:27,140
his like he,
I'm not conflating these,

708
00:34:27,141 --> 00:34:28,010
right.
This is,

709
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:30,800
am I confusing this?
This is when it was the same.

710
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:31,873
He did it on your podcast and then this 
was the Salvia trip where he said that 

711
00:34:36,141 --> 00:34:36,974
he lived like a whole life for like 
three months and there was something 

712
00:34:39,291 --> 00:34:41,360
with water in a bus or something like 
that.

713
00:34:41,361 --> 00:34:42,280
Well,
there was he,

714
00:34:42,890 --> 00:34:44,970
I'm sure he's described it somewhere.
Yeah,

715
00:34:45,570 --> 00:34:46,403
a Reddit Ama.
I think he felt like he had lived a 

716
00:34:51,621 --> 00:34:56,621
whole life like for months,
a whole different life for months.

717
00:34:57,081 --> 00:34:59,840
And then came back from that trip.

718
00:35:01,160 --> 00:35:02,330
Like it just happened.
He realized,

719
00:35:02,360 --> 00:35:02,811
Oh my God,
no,

720
00:35:02,811 --> 00:35:07,010
I just took Salvia.
They really got rid of Salvia fast,

721
00:35:07,011 --> 00:35:09,110
didn't they?
You remember when that was legal,

722
00:35:09,111 --> 00:35:12,080
you'd just buy it online and then two 
within like a year,

723
00:35:12,081 --> 00:35:12,914
they just kind of took care of Salvia.
What is little distinction legally for 

724
00:35:16,941 --> 00:35:17,774
Salvia now it's the scheduling.
They went fast on that legal marijuana 

725
00:35:21,110 --> 00:35:21,943
but lip.
Amen.

726
00:35:22,040 --> 00:35:25,640
But Dude Salvias Ooh,
stronger than marijuana.

727
00:35:25,690 --> 00:35:27,360
Oh,
this is what people didn't know you.

728
00:35:27,410 --> 00:35:30,920
People were going to their pot dealers 
and they trying to,

729
00:35:30,921 --> 00:35:32,750
you know,
get some good weed.

730
00:35:33,170 --> 00:35:37,980
Why you want to have a good experience?
Salvia used to be for sale at head shops

731
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:42,540
everywhere and it was one of the most 
Bolo out of your fucking mind.

732
00:35:42,541 --> 00:35:45,570
Psychedelics you could ever encounter 
right now.

733
00:35:45,840 --> 00:35:49,250
You still buy it.
I used to buy it.

734
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:52,950
Careful Times 80 concentrated 20 x right
here,

735
00:35:52,980 --> 00:35:54,830
one 20 eggs,
cheese.

736
00:35:54,840 --> 00:35:57,620
It's even stronger now.
Oh my God,

737
00:35:59,020 --> 00:36:00,560
I bet it's not legal.
You should.

738
00:36:00,600 --> 00:36:05,120
I wonder if it shows what states they 
will ship to or if you try to buy it.

739
00:36:05,121 --> 00:36:06,090
It tells you like,
Hey,

740
00:36:06,091 --> 00:36:09,840
this is a legal and illegal in most 
parts of the world and here's the,

741
00:36:10,350 --> 00:36:12,210
here's the big problem with all these 
things.

742
00:36:13,260 --> 00:36:16,770
I think all these things could be 
handled way better than they have been.

743
00:36:17,190 --> 00:36:22,090
So people are going buck wild with them,
whether it's mushrooms or whether it's a

744
00:36:22,110 --> 00:36:27,110
lsd or anything.
People left these important compounds in

745
00:36:28,081 --> 00:36:28,914
the hands of people that were willing to
take them illegally and that's where 

746
00:36:31,771 --> 00:36:36,480
most of our data's coming from because 
they couldn't do any tests on anything.

747
00:36:36,510 --> 00:36:38,880
Everything was just scheduled one 
schedule one.

748
00:36:40,050 --> 00:36:40,883
But the people that tested it,
there are people willing to take 

749
00:36:44,281 --> 00:36:47,190
mushrooms.
It's a lot of people did with just white

750
00:36:47,191 --> 00:36:47,550
knuckle.

751
00:36:47,550 --> 00:36:52,080
That shit to death.
Me included at various times in my life,

752
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:55,200
he tried to bring me mushrooms.
I'd white knuckle myself to death.

753
00:36:55,470 --> 00:36:58,560
So it was the people,
the only sampling size that we have from

754
00:36:58,561 --> 00:37:01,530
the benefits that people that were wild 
enough to do it.

755
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:04,290
Like what if we had actual scientists 
studying the shit go,

756
00:37:04,291 --> 00:37:05,124
hey,
maybe we took the stuff and like low 

757
00:37:06,271 --> 00:37:08,220
doses.
We could evolve quicker.

758
00:37:08,310 --> 00:37:09,143
Like this really might be something.
There might be something legitimate to 

759
00:37:12,271 --> 00:37:13,104
the idea that stoned ape theory is that 
humans discovered psilocybin mushrooms 

760
00:37:16,561 --> 00:37:17,394
and that's why the brain grew like 
double its size over a period of 2 

761
00:37:20,520 --> 00:37:21,600
million years.
That's the theory,

762
00:37:21,601 --> 00:37:22,434
I think.
Right?

763
00:37:23,310 --> 00:37:26,250
Mushrooms could have totally been in 
that mix with all the other stuff too.

764
00:37:26,430 --> 00:37:27,263
All the other stuff.
The throwing arm hunting is a film on 

765
00:37:30,511 --> 00:37:33,210
the naughty show podcasts for an old 
death squad studio.

766
00:37:34,170 --> 00:37:35,003
Oh,
it said what happened was I took a hit 

767
00:37:36,451 --> 00:37:39,600
of Salvia,
but I didn't quite take a big enough hit

768
00:37:39,601 --> 00:37:40,434
or I didn't hold it long enough so it 
took me right to the edge of 

769
00:37:43,261 --> 00:37:45,960
disappearing into my mind,
but I didn't quote it,

770
00:37:46,020 --> 00:37:48,390
but it didn't quite get me through the 
barrier.

771
00:37:49,080 --> 00:37:49,913
So I took another hit.
This time the hit was as big as I could 

772
00:37:52,321 --> 00:37:53,154
possibly muster.
It was massive and I held it for a 

773
00:37:55,681 --> 00:37:59,340
really long time.
That hit alone would have been enough to

774
00:37:59,341 --> 00:38:00,174
make me obliterate my consciousness,
but that hit coupled with the one from 

775
00:38:04,801 --> 00:38:08,370
before that all that got me almost 
there,

776
00:38:08,460 --> 00:38:09,293
put me in another place.
I was in a lake in the backyard of my 

777
00:38:12,091 --> 00:38:15,630
childhood home,
but I wasn't me swimming there.

778
00:38:15,810 --> 00:38:20,280
I was a new being who lived underwater.
It took me a little bit of time to learn

779
00:38:20,281 --> 00:38:24,570
how to breathe water,
but then I learned and I was there for a

780
00:38:24,571 --> 00:38:29,571
while.
I mean like months at least I estimate I

781
00:38:29,881 --> 00:38:33,060
was there anywhere from four months to 
two years.

782
00:38:33,540 --> 00:38:35,560
I made friends.
I had a life

783
00:38:36,220 --> 00:38:38,590
all underwater.
At some point,

784
00:38:38,591 --> 00:38:41,020
my new life,
I saw Sam Aaa at the store,

785
00:38:41,110 --> 00:38:44,470
at the shore of the lake,
so I swam up to him to investigate.

786
00:38:45,150 --> 00:38:49,210
Pratt says he was just sitting in the 
chair across from me.

787
00:38:49,211 --> 00:38:51,940
In reality,
that's when they started pulling me back

788
00:38:51,941 --> 00:38:52,774
into this existence,
but what they didn't know was that I 

789
00:38:56,351 --> 00:38:57,184
couldn't breathe air anymore.
I've forgotten how after breathing 

790
00:39:00,071 --> 00:39:00,904
underwater for so long,
I had to relearn the experience of 

791
00:39:03,671 --> 00:39:06,770
breathing.
They says,

792
00:39:06,771 --> 00:39:07,760
man,
that was a good trip.

793
00:39:08,060 --> 00:39:08,893
It looked Talus if you watch the video.
But what's important to understand is 

794
00:39:11,751 --> 00:39:15,350
that the,
that the hellish part was not me wanting

795
00:39:15,351 --> 00:39:17,630
to leave my friends,
family and life and the lake.

796
00:39:17,750 --> 00:39:20,450
It was just adjusting back to this 
reality that hurt.

797
00:39:21,020 --> 00:39:21,853
But the months or years I was living 
there with some of the most beautiful 

798
00:39:25,101 --> 00:39:28,890
and peaceful of my life.
Oh Shit.

799
00:39:28,950 --> 00:39:31,680
Ours brain broke.
I know now.

800
00:39:31,740 --> 00:39:32,573
Now I should look at the video and 
imagine that he lived there for four 

801
00:39:35,041 --> 00:39:36,440
years.
It's totally different when he say,

802
00:39:36,441 --> 00:39:38,460
no,
I feel bad for getting them into drugs.

803
00:39:39,770 --> 00:39:40,603
Look here now.
Here's what the four years he went 

804
00:39:42,061 --> 00:39:44,220
through,
you're allowed to play audio.

805
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:49,880
The smuggling,
he's still holding.

806
00:39:50,340 --> 00:39:51,810
He's sleeping or dead.

807
00:39:52,490 --> 00:39:53,323
So this is a,
a video that we're watching that all 

808
00:39:55,161 --> 00:39:56,800
took place in Brian's apartment.

809
00:39:56,950 --> 00:40:01,950
I think he's dead.
Somebody give me is fucking funny.

810
00:40:04,030 --> 00:40:06,250
Stop.
Oh my God.

811
00:40:06,290 --> 00:40:07,510
You had to shush people.
Well,

812
00:40:07,530 --> 00:40:10,340
it's like he was chairman heart.
I didn't want him to freak out.

813
00:40:10,370 --> 00:40:12,380
Right.
Good call.

814
00:40:12,381 --> 00:40:13,041
See,
I'm Tripoli.

815
00:40:13,041 --> 00:40:14,900
Shut your mouth.
Who else was there?

816
00:40:14,990 --> 00:40:16,130
Triple anywhere else.
Aaa.

817
00:40:16,131 --> 00:40:17,560
Jason Teebo,
Alison

818
00:40:17,740 --> 00:40:20,350
and Maddie.
Kirsch maybe.

819
00:40:20,440 --> 00:40:22,630
Oh,
what a great time to trip people staring

820
00:40:22,631 --> 00:40:23,464
at you talking mad shit while you're 
blown out of your mind into another 

821
00:40:26,321 --> 00:40:31,321
dimension grab.
Oh Wow.

822
00:40:36,380 --> 00:40:40,050
Tell us this long.
So I think probably people,

823
00:40:40,100 --> 00:40:40,933
because this is all right,
you can find this is something you got 

824
00:40:41,971 --> 00:40:43,440
it.
It only works visually,

825
00:40:43,441 --> 00:40:45,660
but if you see it visually,
it's fascinating.

826
00:40:45,661 --> 00:40:49,530
So it's a Ari Shaffir on Salvia and it's
on Brian's.

827
00:40:49,560 --> 00:40:52,920
Is it on yours or it's on it.
So on red bands,

828
00:40:52,921 --> 00:40:57,921
a youtube page,
Ari Shaffir on Salvia Salvias wide every

829
00:40:58,290 --> 00:40:59,123
quarter.
Ari Salvia is why it never did dmt 

830
00:41:00,810 --> 00:41:03,780
because I had too many like,
okay,

831
00:41:03,781 --> 00:41:04,614
I'm too old for this.
I might break my brain moments that I'm 

832
00:41:06,150 --> 00:41:07,240
like,
I don't need to do anymore.

833
00:41:07,410 --> 00:41:08,243
Yeah,
there's,

834
00:41:08,340 --> 00:41:10,680
there's some weird weird drugs out 
there.

835
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:13,200
Re we're really,
really weird ones.

836
00:41:13,800 --> 00:41:14,633
And part of the problem with like legal 
definitions for what what is and isn't 

837
00:41:18,781 --> 00:41:19,920
legal,
there's like gets,

838
00:41:20,100 --> 00:41:20,933
it gets kind of weird and blurry.
Like there was some stuff called five 

839
00:41:23,881 --> 00:41:27,120
Meo dimethyltryptamine,
which is the most potent form of,

840
00:41:27,810 --> 00:41:32,460
of DMT.
And up until like the year 2000 and like

841
00:41:32,461 --> 00:41:34,100
you'd be able to order it online.

842
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:36,260
They would just send it to you.
It's illegal.

843
00:41:36,320 --> 00:41:38,280
Just says not for human consumption were
like,

844
00:41:38,310 --> 00:41:42,530
I don't know what you're doing with it,
but here it is pure and you'd be able to

845
00:41:42,590 --> 00:41:43,423
get enough to blast yourself in the 
universe every day of your life until 

846
00:41:47,241 --> 00:41:50,300
you're dead for like 50 bucks.
It was crazy.

847
00:41:50,720 --> 00:41:51,553
It was crazy.
It was the wild west because people 

848
00:41:53,721 --> 00:41:54,554
didn't know what it was yet because they
had made a distinction that n n 

849
00:41:57,610 --> 00:41:58,443
dimethyltryptamine,
which is the one that gives you all the 

850
00:42:01,010 --> 00:42:05,090
visual hallucinations,
that that was more illegal.

851
00:42:05,840 --> 00:42:06,830
That was,
that was the moment.

852
00:42:06,850 --> 00:42:11,190
That was a schedule one drug that was,
but they had listed five methoxy diamond

853
00:42:11,250 --> 00:42:14,150
field trip to me.
So it was in this weird state of limbo.

854
00:42:15,560 --> 00:42:16,820
Salvia.
They just missed it.

855
00:42:16,880 --> 00:42:19,670
What?
That stuff the fuck outta here.

856
00:42:20,060 --> 00:42:20,930
I can't believe it's Smith.

857
00:42:20,930 --> 00:42:21,763
Steagall did.
This is probably a shitload of those in 

858
00:42:22,971 --> 00:42:23,804
the Amazon.
There's probably a shit load of things 

859
00:42:25,221 --> 00:42:27,560
that are not,
never been discovered.

860
00:42:27,600 --> 00:42:28,433
Nini eat some fruit and you fucking go 
blast off into the center of the 

861
00:42:30,951 --> 00:42:32,240
universe.
I bet.

862
00:42:32,270 --> 00:42:35,000
I bet that,
I bet if we could allow,

863
00:42:36,230 --> 00:42:38,660
if we all decided,
all right,

864
00:42:38,661 --> 00:42:39,770
we're going to leave.
Let's,

865
00:42:39,830 --> 00:42:44,830
let's have humans live everywhere except
one really big spot.

866
00:42:46,160 --> 00:42:48,470
No people can live at this one really 
big spot.

867
00:42:48,590 --> 00:42:53,590
We got to manage like other kind of 
ecosystems in a more hands off sort of a

868
00:42:54,321 --> 00:42:55,154
way because we're just so d like 
separate like the Congo and places like 

869
00:42:57,771 --> 00:42:58,604
that,
but if there was like one country where 

870
00:43:00,021 --> 00:43:01,520
everybody agreed,
all right,

871
00:43:01,521 --> 00:43:04,280
let's just leave this,
leave this spot alone.

872
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:06,770
No one go in there.
Let's see what happens.

873
00:43:07,130 --> 00:43:12,130
Let's see how nature evolves while we 
observe it with modern methods.

874
00:43:12,560 --> 00:43:16,190
Just like step back for a few hundred 
years just as a human project.

875
00:43:16,580 --> 00:43:18,320
Let's see what kind of shit grows in 
there.

876
00:43:18,590 --> 00:43:21,860
If you just leave it alone because we're
so fucking snippy.

877
00:43:21,861 --> 00:43:24,140
Snippy.
Let me get in there and let me dig.

878
00:43:24,141 --> 00:43:26,510
Let me fucking cut these down and I'll 
plant new ones.

879
00:43:26,511 --> 00:43:28,610
Don't worry about it bro.
I'm to plant new ones.

880
00:43:29,060 --> 00:43:29,930
Dude.
I got this,

881
00:43:29,931 --> 00:43:31,910
I cut down the forest and put some new 
ones on.

882
00:43:33,230 --> 00:43:36,530
Not Saying that I'm not hypocritical 
sitting here in front of a wood desk,

883
00:43:36,890 --> 00:43:38,480
you know,
I'm not saying don't do it,

884
00:43:39,040 --> 00:43:39,873
but

885
00:43:41,180 --> 00:43:42,740
I mean think of how weird that is.

886
00:43:44,730 --> 00:43:46,830
If we could just leave all that shit 
alone,

887
00:43:47,010 --> 00:43:47,843
who knows what kind of weird symbiotic 
relationships we could have had with 

888
00:43:50,701 --> 00:43:51,534
plants that might have easily been how 
they came up with Iowasca in the first 

889
00:43:56,461 --> 00:43:57,294
place.
It probably eating a bunch of weird 

890
00:43:59,041 --> 00:43:59,874
fucking plants and all those plants.
We're talking with all those other 

891
00:44:02,341 --> 00:44:03,990
plants and I'm like,
listen,

892
00:44:04,050 --> 00:44:04,883
I know.
I know where we can get just shit 

893
00:44:06,900 --> 00:44:07,733
bumping way quicker.
We got to get these monkey people to to 

894
00:44:11,310 --> 00:44:15,300
figure out how to eat these mushrooms 
and turn it to regular people.

895
00:44:16,700 --> 00:44:19,530
Imagine,
imagine if that's really what it was all

896
00:44:19,531 --> 00:44:20,364
long just grasses and leaves 
communicating to us through some 

897
00:44:24,391 --> 00:44:29,391
nonverbal language and and giving us 
this idea of how to do certain things

898
00:44:31,010 --> 00:44:31,200
and

899
00:44:31,200 --> 00:44:32,033
the,
all these things are all just designed 

900
00:44:32,941 --> 00:44:33,774
to get us to eat the mushrooms we eat.
The mushrooms get to the point where we 

901
00:44:36,601 --> 00:44:37,434
accelerate to the point we have enough 
brain power and enough people combined 

902
00:44:41,490 --> 00:44:45,060
interacting with each other and sharing 
information that we can build artificial

903
00:44:45,061 --> 00:44:48,480
life.
And then that becomes the new thing.

904
00:44:50,490 --> 00:44:54,750
Or along the way we become the aliens.
We've figured out how to use that crispr

905
00:44:54,751 --> 00:44:58,170
technology,
crispr technology.

906
00:44:58,560 --> 00:45:01,110
You know what that is.
It's some new thing.

907
00:45:01,140 --> 00:45:03,150
Uh,
I brought up on the podcast a lot,

908
00:45:03,300 --> 00:45:05,310
so if you've heard it before I 
apologize,

909
00:45:05,311 --> 00:45:06,144
but it's some sort of a,
I'm going to butcher the definition 

910
00:45:07,891 --> 00:45:09,870
again.
It's some sort of a genetic,

911
00:45:09,871 --> 00:45:10,920
um,
uh,

912
00:45:10,950 --> 00:45:11,783
altering system that they're,
they're creating a gene changing system 

913
00:45:16,560 --> 00:45:20,520
where they can do things to the human 
body potentially,

914
00:45:21,050 --> 00:45:21,883
uh,
where they can alter genetics that can 

915
00:45:23,221 --> 00:45:24,054
alter DNA.

916
00:45:25,290 --> 00:45:29,610
It's very complicated and I'm doing a 
terrible job describing it would,

917
00:45:29,611 --> 00:45:32,100
it has essentially let me,
for a dumb person like me,

918
00:45:32,760 --> 00:45:37,740
really super smart people have figured 
out a way to change biology.

919
00:45:38,010 --> 00:45:43,010
They might be able to turn genes on and 
off like for autism for Alzheimer's,

920
00:45:43,860 --> 00:45:48,860
like weird weird genes that create birth
defects or various illnesses that we've,

921
00:45:49,821 --> 00:45:51,660
we've been able to figure out how to 
target.

922
00:45:51,870 --> 00:45:55,590
They might that we identify whether they
might be able to target those things.

923
00:45:55,960 --> 00:45:58,140
They will shut things off,
turn things on.

924
00:45:59,850 --> 00:46:04,650
And I think there was an article really 
recently saying that the original crispr

925
00:46:04,651 --> 00:46:05,484
is now even out of date and the new one 
is far superior there did just getting 

926
00:46:09,391 --> 00:46:10,650
better at it.
They're going to,

927
00:46:10,651 --> 00:46:13,570
they shot some shit into some dude.
Uh,

928
00:46:13,590 --> 00:46:16,350
there was a guy who had a disease and it
was,

929
00:46:16,351 --> 00:46:18,390
I believe it was an incurable disease.

930
00:46:18,390 --> 00:46:22,020
He was the first human recipient of 
crispr technology.

931
00:46:23,640 --> 00:46:25,440
That's like seeing it as science fiction
movie.

932
00:46:25,441 --> 00:46:26,274
Right.
You hear about the first guy that gave 

933
00:46:27,481 --> 00:46:30,240
it a chance to Chris or Christopher and 
2.0

934
00:46:30,241 --> 00:46:31,074
is here and it's way more precise.
See if you could find the article about 

935
00:46:34,411 --> 00:46:39,180
the guy that was the first human 
recipient for crisper.

936
00:46:40,140 --> 00:46:41,400
Why is it spelled like that?
Like,

937
00:46:41,430 --> 00:46:44,340
like a 14 year old emo kid wrote in the 
basement.

938
00:46:44,341 --> 00:46:49,170
Like there's no e it's a CRI s p r I 
think they wanted it to be catchy.

939
00:46:50,040 --> 00:46:51,510
And uh,
I think it's also,

940
00:46:51,511 --> 00:46:53,580
what is that an acronym?
It's an acronym,

941
00:46:53,610 --> 00:46:54,750
right?
Yeah.

942
00:46:55,380 --> 00:46:57,210
I always fuck up acronym.
And the other one,

943
00:46:57,211 --> 00:46:59,490
like what's the dea?
It's an acronym.

944
00:46:59,940 --> 00:47:00,773
That's an acronym.
I thought it was an acronym when you 

945
00:47:02,431 --> 00:47:04,950
said it,
but that's not what it could become as a

946
00:47:04,951 --> 00:47:05,970
word.
Yes.

947
00:47:06,360 --> 00:47:07,650
I don't think it meant yes.

948
00:47:09,720 --> 00:47:10,950
Right.
NASA,

949
00:47:11,460 --> 00:47:12,510
like you say,
NASA,

950
00:47:12,511 --> 00:47:15,540
you don't say the n Asa.
Right.

951
00:47:16,140 --> 00:47:19,110
So what's the difference when those,
I think NASA isn't,

952
00:47:19,111 --> 00:47:23,160
is that I'm so dumb now that it's just 
weird,

953
00:47:23,161 --> 00:47:25,350
you know,
knowledge and an abbreviated form of the

954
00:47:25,351 --> 00:47:28,920
initial letters of other words and 
pronounced as a word,

955
00:47:29,080 --> 00:47:29,913
as a word.
Okay.

956
00:47:30,070 --> 00:47:32,890
So NASA would be an acronym.
So I was right.

957
00:47:33,680 --> 00:47:35,800
I was dumb as I thought that one of the 
drag,

958
00:47:36,430 --> 00:47:37,950
I was super nervous.
I am,

959
00:47:37,960 --> 00:47:40,270
Oh,
I've always been insecure about,

960
00:47:40,271 --> 00:47:42,100
uh,
those kinds of things like that.

961
00:47:42,101 --> 00:47:44,410
You're probably should know like what an
acronym is.

962
00:47:44,860 --> 00:47:45,650
Like,

963
00:47:45,650 --> 00:47:47,180
I don't know that any of that shit 
anymore.

964
00:47:47,210 --> 00:47:48,043
How do you even remember it was talking 
about something I saw or was your mind 

965
00:47:49,721 --> 00:47:54,050
is more that I saw him planners to this 
weekend or is it just came on Netflix.

966
00:47:54,190 --> 00:47:55,023
So good.
There's this island that only birds can 

967
00:47:57,291 --> 00:48:02,291
get onto and honest island is a tree 
that has the seeds that um,

968
00:48:03,200 --> 00:48:05,840
are sticky seeds.
So they get stuck onto the birds.

969
00:48:05,841 --> 00:48:07,850
And when the birds travel from island to
island,

970
00:48:07,851 --> 00:48:08,684
they kind of drop them off or whatever.
But also the seeds can kind of trap the 

971
00:48:12,651 --> 00:48:15,230
birds there and they can end up now just
had right there.

972
00:48:15,500 --> 00:48:18,520
They can get die because they can't get 
too many of them get stuck in the birth,

973
00:48:18,521 --> 00:48:19,354
gets stuck and then they end up falling 
onto the ground and then get absorbed 

974
00:48:21,501 --> 00:48:25,010
into the ground and eating the plants.
Sort of eat them,

975
00:48:25,130 --> 00:48:25,860
if you will.

976
00:48:25,860 --> 00:48:27,100
Yeah.
Oh,

977
00:48:27,150 --> 00:48:29,980
it's kinda crazy.
Whoa.

978
00:48:30,480 --> 00:48:31,610
That's okay.
But here's the thing,

979
00:48:31,611 --> 00:48:32,444
is that coincidence is,
is just like dumb luck evolution I 

980
00:48:35,091 --> 00:48:35,930
suppose.
Yeah,

981
00:48:35,931 --> 00:48:37,370
I think that's,
yeah,

982
00:48:37,480 --> 00:48:41,390
it's dead birds.
Maybe evolution is like a word that's so

983
00:48:41,450 --> 00:48:42,500
under fire.

984
00:48:43,490 --> 00:48:43,790
Okay.

985
00:48:43,790 --> 00:48:47,120
With the a lot of people,
maybe this is because the,

986
00:48:47,121 --> 00:48:52,070
the,
the ramifications of it that it's,

987
00:48:52,310 --> 00:48:54,740
that we're not even,
we're not even going to be,

988
00:48:54,741 --> 00:48:56,380
the final thing is going to be something
like

989
00:48:56,440 --> 00:48:57,273
where did Darren does,
that's how he found out about Darwin's 

990
00:48:59,621 --> 00:49:02,080
Galapagos Islands where he went the 
first time.

991
00:49:02,081 --> 00:49:05,170
Imagine going in there for the first 
time and see and all sorts of crazy,

992
00:49:06,080 --> 00:49:09,050
you know what's really fucked up.
People have gone there and they go there

993
00:49:09,051 --> 00:49:09,884
with shit in their shoes and seeds from 
their shoes get into the Galapagos 

994
00:49:13,101 --> 00:49:13,934
islands and non native plants start 
growing and they identify that it comes 

995
00:49:16,731 --> 00:49:17,564
from literally from people like walking 
through fields near their house and 

996
00:49:20,901 --> 00:49:21,734
wherever the fuck they live and then go 
to the Galapagos and walking around and 

997
00:49:25,610 --> 00:49:26,443
that island is so,
it's been so isolated that it's as like 

998
00:49:28,911 --> 00:49:29,744
delicate immune system that they have to
monitor and just the cracking or shoe 

999
00:49:33,591 --> 00:49:35,420
could have a seat in it.
Yeah.

1000
00:49:35,421 --> 00:49:37,130
Do you know there's a lot of those 
islands.

1001
00:49:37,190 --> 00:49:38,023
I heard the craziest story.
It's a story about goats that these 

1002
00:49:42,291 --> 00:49:45,010
pirates was it pirates?
Hmm.

1003
00:49:45,910 --> 00:49:48,560
I might've made that part up,
but these old sailors,

1004
00:49:50,340 --> 00:49:53,030
these old sailors used to,
uh,

1005
00:49:53,930 --> 00:49:54,763
used to bring goats to islands and they 
would let the goats off so the goats 

1006
00:49:57,891 --> 00:50:01,430
could populate the island and then they 
would have things to eat when they would

1007
00:50:01,431 --> 00:50:02,000
come back.

1008
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:02,833
Cause goats eat everything.
Goats are savage goats in the sailors 

1009
00:50:06,291 --> 00:50:08,810
diet during the golden age of piracy.
Okay.

1010
00:50:08,811 --> 00:50:11,030
I didn't make it up.
See,

1011
00:50:11,031 --> 00:50:14,270
I'm so paranoid.
So paranoid being stupid funny though,

1012
00:50:14,271 --> 00:50:15,110
if you,
but it's true.

1013
00:50:15,830 --> 00:50:16,640
So they would,
uh,

1014
00:50:16,640 --> 00:50:19,010
show up.
They would put these goats,

1015
00:50:19,011 --> 00:50:19,844
they would bring boatloads of goats and 
does leave them on an island and they 

1016
00:50:22,941 --> 00:50:24,710
would say,
next time we're around this area,

1017
00:50:24,950 --> 00:50:27,440
we got food.
Just go to these stupid goats.

1018
00:50:27,441 --> 00:50:29,180
They eat everything.
They eat everything.

1019
00:50:29,181 --> 00:50:30,050
But that's the thing,
man.

1020
00:50:30,051 --> 00:50:34,250
They eat fucking everything.
They devastate ecosystems.

1021
00:50:34,251 --> 00:50:36,830
I had a friend who had goats.
He had goats.

1022
00:50:36,831 --> 00:50:39,380
He has this really sweet ranch,
and he had goats.

1023
00:50:39,410 --> 00:50:39,901
He's like,
oh,

1024
00:50:39,901 --> 00:50:40,734
I'll just have goats.
They'll trim up the lawn and it'd be 

1025
00:50:42,021 --> 00:50:43,460
great.
But the fuck they do,

1026
00:50:43,730 --> 00:50:45,830
they eat everything.
Everything.

1027
00:50:45,831 --> 00:50:46,880
They just eat,
man,

1028
00:50:47,030 --> 00:50:48,110
you just leave shit out.

1029
00:50:48,110 --> 00:50:49,910
They eat that and they need everything 
else too.

1030
00:50:50,060 --> 00:50:53,120
They roses,
they eat all your vegetables.

1031
00:50:53,150 --> 00:50:55,040
You get,
there's not a tree that's growing.

1032
00:50:55,160 --> 00:50:58,220
They're eating everything.
They just go through a hillside.

1033
00:50:58,400 --> 00:51:00,050
People use them.
They have like,

1034
00:51:00,380 --> 00:51:01,213
uh,
like services where companies have 

1035
00:51:03,231 --> 00:51:04,064
trained goats and they bring them to 
your farm or wherever the fuck you want 

1036
00:51:06,891 --> 00:51:09,740
to just let these goats Lou.
And it's just like eats everything.

1037
00:51:09,890 --> 00:51:11,390
They just,
they shit all over the place.

1038
00:51:11,450 --> 00:51:13,640
They eat all over the place and they 
just keep going.

1039
00:51:14,240 --> 00:51:15,710
They're hilarious though.
Yeah.

1040
00:51:15,760 --> 00:51:16,593
So they,
so they had a problem with these goats 

1041
00:51:20,240 --> 00:51:23,270
on one of these pristine islands.
There's too many of them.

1042
00:51:23,540 --> 00:51:24,373
So what they did is they took one of 
them and they put a collar on them so 

1043
00:51:29,481 --> 00:51:34,180
they could always locate them.
They captured him and I think they,

1044
00:51:34,370 --> 00:51:36,440
they snipped him.
They gave him a little,

1045
00:51:36,441 --> 00:51:38,240
a vasectomy,
so he couldn't make any more goats.

1046
00:51:38,570 --> 00:51:41,750
And then goats always flocked to other 
goats.

1047
00:51:42,050 --> 00:51:44,540
So what they would do is this one guy 
with the collar,

1048
00:51:44,810 --> 00:51:46,910
they would use him to locate the other 
goats.

1049
00:51:46,920 --> 00:51:48,500
Then they would gun them all down from 
the sky,

1050
00:51:50,060 --> 00:51:52,350
so they would fly over and they're like,
up there.

1051
00:51:52,370 --> 00:51:53,203
There we found him tucked.
I thought that that gun down all these 

1052
00:51:54,621 --> 00:51:58,100
fucking vegetable eating goats at it 
invaded this island.

1053
00:51:59,180 --> 00:52:01,280
It's a,
it's a crazy podcast,

1054
00:52:01,730 --> 00:52:02,563
I believe.
I'm trying to remember the name of it 

1055
00:52:04,760 --> 00:52:08,810
was on radio lab,
which isn't even a sponsor,

1056
00:52:08,870 --> 00:52:13,870
but I bring it up three times a month.
Galapagos just called Galapagos.

1057
00:52:14,930 --> 00:52:17,120
Yeah,
so it is about that very island is about

1058
00:52:17,121 --> 00:52:17,954
Galapagos and it's about these goats 
that they just decided at a certain 

1059
00:52:20,961 --> 00:52:21,794
point in time with it.
You have to control the populations of 

1060
00:52:23,361 --> 00:52:26,030
them or they're going to devastate 
everything else.

1061
00:52:26,870 --> 00:52:28,970
There's a massive imbalance.
Somebody fucked up.

1062
00:52:28,971 --> 00:52:31,190
They brought goats to a place where 
there's no predators,

1063
00:52:31,700 --> 00:52:33,950
like goats are supposed to be around,
like lions and shit.

1064
00:52:34,490 --> 00:52:35,323
You know,
they're not supposed to be just by 

1065
00:52:35,721 --> 00:52:38,540
themselves,
just eating everything and going off.

1066
00:52:38,990 --> 00:52:40,330
It'd be fun to watch him do it.
Yeah.

1067
00:52:40,460 --> 00:52:42,410
Yeah.
It would be fun.

1068
00:52:43,080 --> 00:52:45,840
Jihirah right about that.
Utuber what he's going through.

1069
00:52:45,841 --> 00:52:46,674
Logan.
Paul.

1070
00:52:47,070 --> 00:52:48,600
I did read that.
Yeah.

1071
00:52:48,750 --> 00:52:49,583
He,
he films someone who had committed 

1072
00:52:50,821 --> 00:52:53,280
suicide in Japan and he put it on his 
youtube channel.

1073
00:52:53,340 --> 00:52:53,700
Yeah.
There,

1074
00:52:53,700 --> 00:52:58,200
I guess there's this forest at the,
the bottom of a volcano or something and

1075
00:52:58,201 --> 00:52:59,034
it called suicide for her,
its nickname suicide forest because 

1076
00:53:00,751 --> 00:53:02,520
everyone just goes there to commit 
suicide.

1077
00:53:02,930 --> 00:53:07,650
And he was going there supposedly to 
film how it's haunted and then they find

1078
00:53:07,651 --> 00:53:10,740
a body and it's pretty gross.
How He,

1079
00:53:10,860 --> 00:53:14,520
you know,
how the video was a,

1080
00:53:14,521 --> 00:53:17,280
he kind of joked about it.
He used humor.

1081
00:53:17,670 --> 00:53:21,420
Jamie told me that the thumbnail had him
like posing with the guy,

1082
00:53:21,450 --> 00:53:22,950
you know,
in the background and,

1083
00:53:23,670 --> 00:53:25,020
and you know,
he's,

1084
00:53:25,050 --> 00:53:25,883
um,

1085
00:53:26,010 --> 00:53:29,070
I don't know anything about him,
but I know he's a youtube guy.

1086
00:53:29,340 --> 00:53:30,173
Right.
And he's doing stuff that he thinks is 

1087
00:53:31,711 --> 00:53:33,660
interesting and provocative,
you know,

1088
00:53:33,800 --> 00:53:37,150
and for whatever reason,
the,

1089
00:53:37,151 --> 00:53:37,984
the dialogue that I had read was 
something to the likes of that he had 

1090
00:53:42,091 --> 00:53:44,100
done it to bring a,
he'll apologize for it,

1091
00:53:44,101 --> 00:53:47,760
which seemed obviously felt terrible 
about the way people viewed it,

1092
00:53:48,600 --> 00:53:49,930
but that he said that,
um,

1093
00:53:50,790 --> 00:53:52,920
how did he describe it?
Um,

1094
00:53:54,420 --> 00:53:55,253
he was trying to bring some sort of a,
he thought he was going to bring some 

1095
00:53:57,301 --> 00:54:00,390
sort of an awareness to suicide,
but it was like a clunky,

1096
00:54:00,391 --> 00:54:03,270
he just didn't do it right and prayed 
the respect that it deserved.

1097
00:54:03,540 --> 00:54:04,373
He realized that he fucked up.
He's basically saying he's trying to do 

1098
00:54:06,361 --> 00:54:08,160
something and you fucked up,
you know?

1099
00:54:09,120 --> 00:54:09,953
I don't know,
man.

1100
00:54:10,110 --> 00:54:12,570
It's pretty gross.
I just found out that he's not the same.

1101
00:54:12,600 --> 00:54:15,500
Like there's a Jake Paul and it look and
Paul,

1102
00:54:15,501 --> 00:54:17,370
I thought they were the same person.
Why blood?

1103
00:54:17,371 --> 00:54:18,100
Why is everyone okay,

1104
00:54:18,100 --> 00:54:18,933
matt?
I don't know what anyone's mad at him 

1105
00:54:19,931 --> 00:54:22,630
for the mad at him because he showed you
something you didn't want to see.

1106
00:54:22,690 --> 00:54:23,310
Is that what it is?

1107
00:54:23,310 --> 00:54:25,170
Because the video,
he kind of like,

1108
00:54:25,171 --> 00:54:26,250
they were like,
look at his hands,

1109
00:54:26,251 --> 00:54:30,600
they're blue and oh and like kind of,
he kind of was very poor taste.

1110
00:54:30,840 --> 00:54:32,850
He also advertised it like the day 
before,

1111
00:54:32,851 --> 00:54:33,684
like I had this crazy sick video you 
guys are going to freak out about and 

1112
00:54:35,971 --> 00:54:36,840
you should have like that.
Oh,

1113
00:54:36,841 --> 00:54:39,810
so he got a chance to look at it and you
still approved it and then released it.

1114
00:54:39,830 --> 00:54:40,663
Yeah.
And then he made a thumbnail where it 

1115
00:54:41,791 --> 00:54:45,000
looked like he posed for like photos 
with a guy in the background.

1116
00:54:45,001 --> 00:54:45,900
It's very,
you know,

1117
00:54:45,901 --> 00:54:46,734
this was a person and,
and they're like laughing right next to 

1118
00:54:49,421 --> 00:54:50,460
this body.
You know,

1119
00:54:50,461 --> 00:54:51,294
it's,

1120
00:54:51,790 --> 00:54:53,910
but I dunno,
that disturbs the shit out of us.

1121
00:54:53,911 --> 00:54:55,520
Right.
Like making,

1122
00:54:55,590 --> 00:54:58,230
like joking around.
He could joke around,

1123
00:54:59,130 --> 00:55:00,810
but he can't joke around near a dead 
guy.

1124
00:55:01,540 --> 00:55:03,130
Well,
suicide's not funny,

1125
00:55:03,131 --> 00:55:05,410
so it's not,
if the guy died,

1126
00:55:05,450 --> 00:55:07,290
like natural causes,
no one's laughing.

1127
00:55:07,320 --> 00:55:09,060
The suicide,
the laughing at him,

1128
00:55:09,150 --> 00:55:11,340
joking around near the guy who committed
suicide.

1129
00:55:11,360 --> 00:55:12,660
Like,
I'm not saying you should do it.

1130
00:55:12,690 --> 00:55:14,580
You definitely shouldn't.
I don't want to see it.

1131
00:55:14,970 --> 00:55:17,520
But it's Kinda funny that we like 
decide,

1132
00:55:17,910 --> 00:55:19,500
like you said,
just respectful bro.

1133
00:55:21,180 --> 00:55:24,120
But he didn't really do anything.
He just showed up and this guy was dead,

1134
00:55:24,420 --> 00:55:25,253
you know?
I'm not saying he should make fun of 

1135
00:55:25,931 --> 00:55:26,820
him.
We definitely shouldn't,

1136
00:55:26,821 --> 00:55:27,654
but it's,
it's weird the outrage that we have for 

1137
00:55:29,521 --> 00:55:30,190
it.

1138
00:55:30,190 --> 00:55:31,023
I'm sure he made a shit load of money 
because I've got 7 million viewers and 

1139
00:55:33,111 --> 00:55:35,200
you made money off it as suicide.
Yeah.

1140
00:55:35,201 --> 00:55:36,690
And you're talking about,
and we're talking about it,

1141
00:55:36,691 --> 00:55:37,580
we're helping them out.
Well,

1142
00:55:37,610 --> 00:55:38,443
the video got pulled,
but I guess I've got re uploaded a few 

1143
00:55:39,971 --> 00:55:40,804
times.
He just made a second apology today 

1144
00:55:43,160 --> 00:55:46,120
because the first apology a lot of 
people said was very insensitive,

1145
00:55:46,420 --> 00:55:47,560
defending him.
Don't,

1146
00:55:47,590 --> 00:55:49,140
don't get me wrong,
I'm just exploring.

1147
00:55:49,160 --> 00:55:49,993
I look,
sometimes I try to look at things from 

1148
00:55:52,240 --> 00:55:54,190
as many perspective as her,
Ken,

1149
00:55:54,700 --> 00:55:55,840
and I don't,
I don't,

1150
00:55:55,841 --> 00:56:00,490
uh,
I don't think that you ever want to make

1151
00:56:00,491 --> 00:56:01,870
fun of someone dying.
Right.

1152
00:56:02,040 --> 00:56:03,880
Right.
When you're right there and you're,

1153
00:56:03,910 --> 00:56:06,570
you're,
you're taking videos and you know,

1154
00:56:06,580 --> 00:56:08,800
it was a dead body hanging.
It's a terrible idea.

1155
00:56:08,870 --> 00:56:10,340
Now of 20.
This was 20 years ago.

1156
00:56:10,341 --> 00:56:11,950
It'd be okay.
Probably probably,

1157
00:56:12,740 --> 00:56:13,670
you know what,
the most horrific,

1158
00:56:13,671 --> 00:56:13,900
terrific

1159
00:56:13,900 --> 00:56:14,733
video or a photograph or other,
I think that a I ever saw about the 

1160
00:56:18,280 --> 00:56:21,760
civil rights movement.
There's this photo of a,

1161
00:56:21,830 --> 00:56:23,740
all these weird white,
but like

1162
00:56:26,470 --> 00:56:28,260
if I remember correctly,
there's kids.

1163
00:56:28,350 --> 00:56:31,050
I remember counting.
I might've made that up,

1164
00:56:31,051 --> 00:56:31,884
but I remember these people standing 
there while there was this black guy 

1165
00:56:35,791 --> 00:56:38,310
hanging from a tree.
It might've been more than one black guy

1166
00:56:39,570 --> 00:56:41,340
and it's a,
it's one of those photos.

1167
00:56:41,341 --> 00:56:42,200
It just make you go,

1168
00:56:42,390 --> 00:56:43,790
whoa.

1169
00:56:45,400 --> 00:56:46,233
It's holy Shit.
They're one of the most disturbing 

1170
00:56:49,001 --> 00:56:50,530
photos.
This is a right there.

1171
00:56:50,610 --> 00:56:51,770
Like look at that photo.
That's,

1172
00:56:51,900 --> 00:56:53,350
that is the exact photo.
Oh,

1173
00:56:53,351 --> 00:56:55,740
actually it a white guy there too.
That's weird.

1174
00:56:55,750 --> 00:56:57,710
We see a pirate.
The must have been something went wrong.

1175
00:56:57,940 --> 00:57:00,780
Photo actually says,
Oh get,

1176
00:57:01,570 --> 00:57:03,250
that's the real one.
That's the real one.

1177
00:57:03,430 --> 00:57:05,170
Son of a bitch.
That is the real one.

1178
00:57:05,171 --> 00:57:07,330
Now I remember God,
my memory's starting to suck.

1179
00:57:07,720 --> 00:57:10,390
The guy pointing up that looks like a 
Hitler.

1180
00:57:11,380 --> 00:57:12,850
But those look like white guys too,
Bro.

1181
00:57:13,430 --> 00:57:13,841
Oh,
okay.

1182
00:57:13,841 --> 00:57:15,310
That's round.
Does it.

1183
00:57:15,550 --> 00:57:18,130
The guy on the left that's just like 
light.

1184
00:57:20,680 --> 00:57:21,513
There's something super disturbing about
dudes with those old school press hats 

1185
00:57:24,161 --> 00:57:26,710
on staring up at bodies,
hanging from ropes.

1186
00:57:27,490 --> 00:57:31,920
Fuck man,
that wasn't that long ago.

1187
00:57:32,280 --> 00:57:34,350
You know?
That's a,

1188
00:57:36,500 --> 00:57:37,333
that's what's horrifying.
But that was less than a hundred years 

1189
00:57:40,730 --> 00:57:42,650
ago and it still happened probably 
right?

1190
00:57:42,651 --> 00:57:43,484
What year was that?

1191
00:57:44,010 --> 00:57:44,843
No,

1192
00:57:46,420 --> 00:57:48,400
but by,
but that way,

1193
00:57:48,430 --> 00:57:53,430
1930 1930 holy Shit.
That that way was like accepted in 1930

1194
00:57:57,370 --> 00:57:58,203
wow.

1195
00:57:59,960 --> 00:58:02,510
All this sun new stuff like this magic 
leap,

1196
00:58:02,511 --> 00:58:03,344
these headsets,
all these different things that we're 

1197
00:58:04,491 --> 00:58:07,520
doing.
I think they're gonna.

1198
00:58:07,550 --> 00:58:10,250
I think we're in the middle of this so 
it doesn't,

1199
00:58:10,280 --> 00:58:14,780
it's not registering is how fucking 
ridiculous it is and how insane it is.

1200
00:58:15,050 --> 00:58:15,883
I think we're just so caught up in the 
frothy waves of how crazy all this new 

1201
00:58:19,551 --> 00:58:20,384
shit is that we're not,
we're not really paying attention 

1202
00:58:23,331 --> 00:58:25,730
enough.
This is,

1203
00:58:26,060 --> 00:58:29,420
this is happening way quicker than I 
thought it was going to.

1204
00:58:32,850 --> 00:58:36,450
We went flying cars by now though.
Now he's going to be robots.

1205
00:58:36,690 --> 00:58:37,523
Those Boston dynamic backflip in 
gymnastics robot's going to win the 

1206
00:58:40,741 --> 00:58:44,040
Olympics because other than proven they 
can do it.

1207
00:58:44,070 --> 00:58:47,160
Is there any benefit in a robot being 
able to do a backflip?

1208
00:58:47,340 --> 00:58:48,173
Dude,
could you imagine those no benefit just 

1209
00:58:51,301 --> 00:58:52,650
to look cool.
I just wanted to check.

1210
00:58:52,760 --> 00:58:53,593
No,
no,

1211
00:58:53,880 --> 00:58:58,380
not at all.
Could you imagine if I'm the first robot

1212
00:58:59,460 --> 00:59:02,880
enters into the Olympics and then people
are like,

1213
00:59:02,881 --> 00:59:03,720
Hey,
what the fuck?

1214
00:59:03,750 --> 00:59:04,690
You can't do that.
Like,

1215
00:59:04,710 --> 00:59:05,543
no,
and he just,

1216
00:59:05,610 --> 00:59:08,010
we gave him all the strengths of a 
regular person.

1217
00:59:08,040 --> 00:59:09,780
100% no more,
no less,

1218
00:59:11,070 --> 00:59:11,903
and he has feelings too,
so let them in there and don't be a 

1219
00:59:14,820 --> 00:59:16,860
robot.
Phobic goes back to my one question.

1220
00:59:17,190 --> 00:59:19,460
What gender are the robots or the AI?
Females.

1221
00:59:20,390 --> 00:59:21,500
Yeah.
No,

1222
00:59:21,501 --> 00:59:21,980
you know what it

1223
00:59:21,980 --> 00:59:22,611
is.
They're,

1224
00:59:22,611 --> 00:59:25,760
they're the first neutral gender people 
and there's so much happier.

1225
00:59:26,330 --> 00:59:29,030
There's neutral gender.
Nobody cares about gender.

1226
00:59:29,090 --> 00:59:31,160
Just be nice.
That's all they care about.

1227
00:59:31,340 --> 00:59:32,870
There's no boy,
girl.

1228
00:59:32,871 --> 00:59:35,330
They figured out a way to get past that 
with that crispr shit.

1229
00:59:36,140 --> 00:59:36,973
That's what it is.

1230
00:59:37,220 --> 00:59:39,880
We seen that new sex robot.
You should get that for the stadium.

1231
00:59:40,380 --> 00:59:43,280
All right Brian,
you can order it now,

1232
00:59:43,700 --> 00:59:47,190
but you don't want the first models man 
funnier that way.

1233
00:59:47,240 --> 00:59:50,230
One of them sharper image besides things
and breaks your desks.

1234
00:59:51,440 --> 00:59:52,273
They don't break you discs.
I think it'd be funny to have the first 

1235
00:59:53,871 --> 00:59:57,170
version now had early version before 
they have massage chairs.

1236
00:59:57,430 --> 00:59:58,263
They just have this actually asked,
they might've had massage chairs at the 

1237
00:59:59,991 --> 01:00:00,824
same time,
but they had this thing that you would 

1238
01:00:03,021 --> 01:00:03,854
grab a hold of.
It had like handles on the side and it 

1239
01:00:05,631 --> 01:00:07,850
did like Shiatsu remember that thing?
It was like,

1240
01:00:08,050 --> 01:00:11,510
like little like little metal knuckles.
It would dig in your neck.

1241
01:00:12,420 --> 01:00:13,850
It's like,
this is amazing.

1242
01:00:14,030 --> 01:00:15,320
But uh,
when I was doing,

1243
01:00:15,321 --> 01:00:16,410
I was like,
how is this,

1244
01:00:16,770 --> 01:00:17,603
they're gonna someone's gonna get hurt 
like some little old lady and you've 

1245
01:00:22,551 --> 01:00:24,230
forced that fucking thing on their neck.
Like,

1246
01:00:24,231 --> 01:00:26,390
Yo,
be careful with this thing.

1247
01:00:26,450 --> 01:00:27,460
This thing's got some kicks

1248
01:00:27,640 --> 01:00:28,473
to it.
The best thing I ever found for that 

1249
01:00:33,461 --> 01:00:34,294
kind of shit is a time massage.
You ever go get a time massage to stand 

1250
01:00:37,481 --> 01:00:39,910
on you and stretch you out?
That's the shit.

1251
01:00:39,950 --> 01:00:42,220
Yeah,
that's better than any machine.

1252
01:00:42,250 --> 01:00:44,260
There's something about a person just 
doing it.

1253
01:00:44,261 --> 01:00:48,100
Like getting in there with their elbow 
is so much better than any machine.

1254
01:00:48,830 --> 01:00:49,663
Yeah.
I have this little girl I go to and she 

1255
01:00:51,291 --> 01:00:52,124
has like the,
like the handles where she holds onto 

1256
01:00:53,810 --> 01:00:55,580
and it's just digging her knee and your 
back.

1257
01:00:55,730 --> 01:00:57,800
And I always say medium and it hurts 
like hell.

1258
01:00:57,801 --> 01:01:00,080
I can't even imagine the hard one.

1259
01:01:01,180 --> 01:01:06,180
Ties have so many things nailed.
They can figure it out.

1260
01:01:06,491 --> 01:01:08,870
The best form of kickboxing,
you know,

1261
01:01:08,890 --> 01:01:11,290
Thai boxing changed everything.
It's weird.

1262
01:01:11,291 --> 01:01:16,291
This one small place figured out the way
to do it was the kick people's legs.

1263
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:18,400
And you know how they figured it out,
man?

1264
01:01:18,550 --> 01:01:19,383
Gambling,

1265
01:01:21,300 --> 01:01:24,980
gambling made it profitable to have 
fights all the time because people loved

1266
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:27,450
gamble.
So they'd have all these people fighting

1267
01:01:27,451 --> 01:01:28,284
and ties.
They even altered their style to 

1268
01:01:29,971 --> 01:01:30,804
accommodate the gambling.
Like the first round they would go real 

1269
01:01:34,111 --> 01:01:37,620
slow because they wanted everybody to 
place their bets.

1270
01:01:37,890 --> 01:01:38,723
So Pete,
they would just take it slow and 

1271
01:01:39,511 --> 01:01:42,870
everybody knew the fight didn't really 
begin to the second of the third round,

1272
01:01:43,170 --> 01:01:44,003
so it wasn't like American fighting 
where you'd have like a Mike Tyson who 

1273
01:01:46,930 --> 01:01:50,400
be cherished for knocking people out 
very quickly.

1274
01:01:50,620 --> 01:01:51,240
Like,
like what?

1275
01:01:51,240 --> 01:01:52,073
Like there would be over under bets is 
this guy is Tony Tubs gonna last the 

1276
01:01:55,801 --> 01:01:56,634
first three rounds,
three minutes of the fight is Michael 

1277
01:01:59,131 --> 01:02:01,890
spinks gonna last the first three like 
world class fighters.

1278
01:02:05,130 --> 01:02:10,130
Dude magic get hit by Mike Tyson when he
was 20 years old mountain man.

1279
01:02:10,951 --> 01:02:14,760
How horrible that would be.
He was at the fights this past weekend.

1280
01:02:15,300 --> 01:02:16,150
I said,
I know him.

1281
01:02:16,470 --> 01:02:18,420
Hi Mike.
That's so weird.

1282
01:02:19,830 --> 01:02:20,100
It's

1283
01:02:20,100 --> 01:02:23,100
amazing.
He's still a tank to dude.

1284
01:02:23,550 --> 01:02:24,383
Terrifying looking person.
Or there's a video of him hitting the 

1285
01:02:27,151 --> 01:02:29,010
bags like 51 years old or something like
that,

1286
01:02:29,310 --> 01:02:30,960
hitting the heavy bag and you're like,
oh,

1287
01:02:30,961 --> 01:02:32,370
okay.
You could still fuck you up.

1288
01:02:32,590 --> 01:02:37,590
Hundred percent like in terms of like 
retired heavyweight champions,

1289
01:02:37,591 --> 01:02:38,424
there was a trend that existed.
You know where someone would retire and 

1290
01:02:42,841 --> 01:02:44,550
then they would,
you know,

1291
01:02:44,730 --> 01:02:47,250
they wouldn't,
they wouldn't keep their form.

1292
01:02:47,490 --> 01:02:49,410
They would get heavy.
And that happened with Mike.

1293
01:02:49,411 --> 01:02:51,960
He got like very heavy look at this.
49 year old,

1294
01:02:52,060 --> 01:02:53,830
49 so this is like two years ago.
Yeah.

1295
01:02:55,560 --> 01:02:57,480
Fuck all this.
Give me some volume.

1296
01:03:02,190 --> 01:03:03,023
Fuck that dude.
49 year old Mike Tyson will put you to 

1297
01:03:07,321 --> 01:03:12,090
sleep 100% and when you're around him,
you realize he like,

1298
01:03:12,320 --> 01:03:15,390
he's just,
who was that?

1299
01:03:15,440 --> 01:03:16,410
A rapper?
Meek Mill.

1300
01:03:16,460 --> 01:03:17,293
Oh,
that's,

1301
01:03:18,150 --> 01:03:22,380
oh,
make C.

1302
01:03:22,470 --> 01:03:25,800
I blame his trainers right there.
If I was the guy holding the camera,

1303
01:03:25,801 --> 01:03:26,670
it'd be like,
stop it.

1304
01:03:27,570 --> 01:03:29,100
Okay.
First of all,

1305
01:03:29,460 --> 01:03:32,190
we've got to straighten this whole thing
out before you start hitting hard.

1306
01:03:32,900 --> 01:03:37,380
You gotta you gotta move all this.
This might be just a personal trainer,

1307
01:03:37,410 --> 01:03:38,243
not a boxing person,
but I'm looking in the background and I 

1308
01:03:40,740 --> 01:03:44,520
feel like I see boxing and stuff on the 
wall.

1309
01:03:44,650 --> 01:03:48,720
They pray that played that video.
Young Mike Tyson with custom motto.

1310
01:03:48,780 --> 01:03:49,613
Oh my God,
I want to change the way you feel about 

1311
01:03:51,271 --> 01:03:52,104
physics.

1312
01:03:54,300 --> 01:03:57,690
Custom motto was old and dying.
He was a really old guy,

1313
01:03:57,691 --> 01:03:58,524
but he had just this deep knowledge of 
psychology and boxing and he trained 

1314
01:04:02,401 --> 01:04:03,234
this unbelievably fast and powerful 
talented kid who had massive hunger for 

1315
01:04:07,801 --> 01:04:10,710
success.
The whole story of Mike Tyson,

1316
01:04:10,740 --> 01:04:15,240
a lot is wrapped up in the story of 
custom auto who had been around forever,

1317
01:04:15,750 --> 01:04:19,070
and this is his last and greatest pupil.
And Mike [inaudible],

1318
01:04:19,110 --> 01:04:19,943
Mike knew it while it was happening,
and by the time he won the heavyweight 

1319
01:04:21,871 --> 01:04:24,240
championship,
custom mono had already died.

1320
01:04:24,900 --> 01:04:28,500
But he dedicated it all to him.
There was nobody like him.

1321
01:04:28,520 --> 01:04:29,610
And you know,
people like,

1322
01:04:30,090 --> 01:04:30,930
they say,
Oh,

1323
01:04:30,931 --> 01:04:31,764
you know,
but he never fought Ali and he never 

1324
01:04:32,791 --> 01:04:34,140
fought these guys that,
you know,

1325
01:04:34,141 --> 01:04:36,360
his era,
people weren't as good.

1326
01:04:37,290 --> 01:04:38,760
Maybe,
maybe,

1327
01:04:38,790 --> 01:04:43,270
but everybody in his era,
he fucked up all of them up until spanx,

1328
01:04:43,650 --> 01:04:46,620
or excuse me until I'm a bust the 
Hendrix.

1329
01:04:46,800 --> 01:04:47,430
No.
Yup.

1330
01:04:47,430 --> 01:04:48,121
Well,
buster,

1331
01:04:48,121 --> 01:04:50,160
yeah,
buster was the first one to beat him,

1332
01:04:50,161 --> 01:04:51,480
but I meant uh,
holyfield.

1333
01:04:51,740 --> 01:04:53,370
Yeah,
that's how fucked up I am.

1334
01:04:53,640 --> 01:04:54,473
I said,
Hendrix,

1335
01:04:55,640 --> 01:04:58,870
I was trying to remember what the fight 
was when holy field,

1336
01:04:59,000 --> 01:05:00,630
uh,
beat Tyson,

1337
01:05:00,631 --> 01:05:04,080
those two fights in a row like that was,
that was big.

1338
01:05:04,140 --> 01:05:07,680
And when Tyson bid,
his ear like that was big.

1339
01:05:07,760 --> 01:05:08,970
Like the,
that was like,

1340
01:05:08,971 --> 01:05:12,390
when you realize like he's just not,
he's not the same guy he was.

1341
01:05:12,480 --> 01:05:14,850
We both lived in Columbus when buster 
douglas knocked him out,

1342
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:17,590
that was a crazy,
like he became the big,

1343
01:05:17,591 --> 01:05:18,190
big fucking

1344
01:05:18,190 --> 01:05:19,300
hero.
No one knew who he was really.

1345
01:05:19,301 --> 01:05:22,060
I feel like when I was young,
but then he was supposed to take over at

1346
01:05:22,061 --> 01:05:24,790
the east side of the city.
He was gonna to change everything,

1347
01:05:24,791 --> 01:05:27,520
have a big giant boxing gym and never 
happened.

1348
01:05:28,180 --> 01:05:30,690
We know the story of Buster Douglas,
it's an amazing story.

1349
01:05:31,140 --> 01:05:34,110
His mom died,
his mom died when he was in training for

1350
01:05:34,111 --> 01:05:35,020
the fight.
Oh really?

1351
01:05:35,280 --> 01:05:39,270
And all of his life,
he had kind of been really talented as a

1352
01:05:39,271 --> 01:05:40,104
boxer,
but hadn't really completely dedicated 

1353
01:05:41,611 --> 01:05:44,100
himself to it.
So when his mom died,

1354
01:05:44,101 --> 01:05:49,101
he went completely insane in the gym in 
preparation for Tyson.

1355
01:05:51,690 --> 01:05:52,523
And then when it came out that he,
it was like two people that had the 

1356
01:05:55,891 --> 01:05:59,400
exact opposite things happen to them for
Tyson.

1357
01:05:59,610 --> 01:06:02,460
He had just been smashed and everybody 
for so long,

1358
01:06:02,461 --> 01:06:05,450
he was so good and so scary.
He would win fights for the,

1359
01:06:05,451 --> 01:06:06,284
you could even start,
it would just be a matter of whether or 

1360
01:06:08,131 --> 01:06:10,260
not you are going to make it out of the 
first round.

1361
01:06:10,261 --> 01:06:13,920
Sometimes he's just smashing people.
But for Buster Douglas is like,

1362
01:06:13,921 --> 01:06:18,450
he had some good fights and some bad 
fights and it just wasn't,

1363
01:06:18,510 --> 01:06:20,730
it wasn't completely consistent,
but he was talented.

1364
01:06:21,480 --> 01:06:22,313
But then when his mom died,
it was right when the time when Tyson 

1365
01:06:25,170 --> 01:06:26,250
was,
you know,

1366
01:06:26,251 --> 01:06:31,251
just overconfident.
He was a 46 to one underdog I think.

1367
01:06:31,620 --> 01:06:35,880
Is that what it was?
It was marketed as Tyson is back fight,

1368
01:06:36,360 --> 01:06:37,200
which I didn't.
Oh Wow.

1369
01:06:37,201 --> 01:06:39,150
I didn't know that.
Tyson is back.

1370
01:06:40,050 --> 01:06:41,550
I don't remember that.
What,

1371
01:06:41,551 --> 01:06:42,960
um,
what were the odds,

1372
01:06:43,380 --> 01:06:44,213
because I think it was one of the 
craziest odds of someone who want to 

1373
01:06:47,140 --> 01:06:52,140
fight 42 to one.
It says 42 to one is a law.

1374
01:06:53,160 --> 01:06:57,630
That means you have to be a total sucker
to bet on Buster Douglas.

1375
01:06:57,631 --> 01:06:59,010
But I'll take your money.
Stupid.

1376
01:06:59,190 --> 01:06:59,491
Yeah,
yeah.

1377
01:06:59,491 --> 01:07:02,550
I'll give you $4,200
if you give me a hundred you know,

1378
01:07:02,551 --> 01:07:05,310
it's like they're so confident that 
Tyson's going to beat them.

1379
01:07:05,430 --> 01:07:08,910
They're willing to bet 42 times whatever
you're going to put up.

1380
01:07:09,660 --> 01:07:12,090
That to me is always,
I think bets.

1381
01:07:12,630 --> 01:07:15,720
I'm not telling you what to do,
but I think bet she'd be like,

1382
01:07:16,890 --> 01:07:18,360
I think actually I,
I take it back.

1383
01:07:18,390 --> 01:07:19,530
I think it should be able do whatever 
you want,

1384
01:07:19,680 --> 01:07:21,750
but I think the real bet should be who 
do you want?

1385
01:07:21,780 --> 01:07:26,670
Who Do you think's going to win?
It's making it real clear who's going to

1386
01:07:26,671 --> 01:07:28,200
win.
If you say,

1387
01:07:28,230 --> 01:07:29,130
Oh,
well,

1388
01:07:29,250 --> 01:07:30,083
uh,
we'll Michael spanx making out of the 

1389
01:07:30,961 --> 01:07:31,650
first round.
Like,

1390
01:07:31,650 --> 01:07:32,483
all right,
now we're getting weird because this is 

1391
01:07:33,601 --> 01:07:34,434
some shit you might be able to effect.
Maybe you might be able to talk to Mike 

1392
01:07:37,520 --> 01:07:40,140
and Mike.
There's a lot of money in this fight.

1393
01:07:40,290 --> 01:07:42,150
It was even more if we can get to the 
second round,

1394
01:07:42,151 --> 01:07:44,130
you know what I'm saying?
Bro Know what I'm saying?

1395
01:07:44,200 --> 01:07:46,450
The last bit I liked that was Amanda 
Nunez.

1396
01:07:46,700 --> 01:07:48,250
Yeah.
Kayo and the second round,

1397
01:07:48,251 --> 01:07:49,440
like specifically pick that.

1398
01:07:49,840 --> 01:07:50,673
That's very important to protect against
that kind of influence because that 

1399
01:07:53,261 --> 01:07:56,260
Shit's real.
That shit's happened throughout sports.

1400
01:07:56,270 --> 01:07:57,850
If someone comes up to you and goes,
look,

1401
01:07:58,060 --> 01:08:00,310
there's a lot of money if this fight 
goes into the third round.

1402
01:08:00,370 --> 01:08:04,900
So we're going to do look at his,
the ons 72 to [inaudible] 72 to one.

1403
01:08:04,901 --> 01:08:06,700
This fight goes to the third round.
Know what that means.

1404
01:08:06,910 --> 01:08:09,930
You let the vine go to the third round 
and we'll make a lot more more.

1405
01:08:09,931 --> 01:08:10,140
Yeah,

1406
01:08:10,140 --> 01:08:11,100
I heard the,
uh,

1407
01:08:11,820 --> 01:08:16,190
a lot of people were a little worried 
about the over under for Holly Holm.

1408
01:08:16,190 --> 01:08:17,023
Cyborg fight being only one and a half,
I think was the over under real or we 

1409
01:08:19,911 --> 01:08:21,830
thought it probably was going to go away
longer.

1410
01:08:23,360 --> 01:08:25,220
That's a probably a gambling thing,
right?

1411
01:08:25,250 --> 01:08:27,160
Is that it has,
I think it has to do with the,

1412
01:08:27,230 --> 01:08:28,063
where the money sits.
Yeah.

1413
01:08:28,120 --> 01:08:30,160
But is that what he does?
I wish we knew.

1414
01:08:30,460 --> 01:08:31,660
Probably find out.
Find out.

1415
01:08:31,661 --> 01:08:32,650
Exactly.
But yeah,

1416
01:08:32,880 --> 01:08:33,713
I don't,
we used to talk to a gambling experts 

1417
01:08:35,651 --> 01:08:39,070
sometimes on the old days of the UFC on 
spike,

1418
01:08:39,100 --> 01:08:41,200
there were a guy would come on and he 
would,

1419
01:08:41,260 --> 01:08:42,093
uh,
he would give us the odds to go local 

1420
01:08:45,791 --> 01:08:46,624
oddsmaker type guy.
And he and I would even disagree about 

1421
01:08:48,281 --> 01:08:51,020
shit sometimes.
God dammit.

1422
01:08:51,040 --> 01:08:54,790
I can't remember his name.
See if you can remember that gentleman's

1423
01:08:54,791 --> 01:08:55,030
name.

1424
01:08:55,030 --> 01:08:55,863
I feel terrible.
What was that Ugg boot you had on your 

1425
01:08:57,191 --> 01:08:58,090
head?
Was that,

1426
01:08:58,150 --> 01:08:58,983
oh,
how dare you.

1427
01:08:59,800 --> 01:09:01,810
How dare you?
It's a,

1428
01:09:01,900 --> 01:09:03,860
I don't want to mispronounce it.
So yeah.

1429
01:09:04,180 --> 01:09:06,670
Is it like a religious thing or?
Um,

1430
01:09:06,671 --> 01:09:07,510
no,
it's uh,

1431
01:09:07,720 --> 01:09:08,800
from uh,
his,

1432
01:09:09,100 --> 01:09:10,990
his area of Dagestan,

1433
01:09:11,790 --> 01:09:12,650
they,
um,

1434
01:09:14,280 --> 01:09:17,280
I have it saved here on my thing cause 
people been asking me,

1435
01:09:17,730 --> 01:09:19,890
uh,
in his area of Dagestan they,

1436
01:09:19,891 --> 01:09:21,600
um,
to where this thing it says,

1437
01:09:21,601 --> 01:09:23,280
um,
it's what a warrior,

1438
01:09:23,490 --> 01:09:27,270
a mountain clan.
There are warrior mountain clan and that

1439
01:09:27,271 --> 01:09:31,170
this is what they're shepherds were.
And this is what you call it.

1440
01:09:31,220 --> 01:09:34,650
[inaudible].
I don't want to fuck this up,

1441
01:09:34,800 --> 01:09:39,390
but it looks like it says pop poo pop 
popup Hoopa.

1442
01:09:39,600 --> 01:09:42,720
The pub Hoopla.
Probably fucking that up,

1443
01:09:42,780 --> 01:09:46,350
but this is how it's pronounced.
I know how to spell it.

1444
01:09:47,320 --> 01:09:50,230
You look like that one guy that got 
arrested for murdering his wife.

1445
01:09:50,260 --> 01:09:51,093
Was that,
what was that?

1446
01:09:51,490 --> 01:09:52,660
What are you,
that old guy,

1447
01:09:52,661 --> 01:09:54,550
Phil Spector and Phil Spector.
Oh,

1448
01:09:54,551 --> 01:09:55,600
no,
that wasn't his wife.

1449
01:09:55,660 --> 01:09:56,530
Oh,
that's hilarious.

1450
01:09:57,070 --> 01:10:01,680
That's very funny actually.
That's strong it strong.

1451
01:10:01,690 --> 01:10:06,690
Remember that guy you show up for court 
with these crazy wigs on w was it a wing

1452
01:10:06,991 --> 01:10:09,150
or was it actually his hair?
No,

1453
01:10:09,230 --> 01:10:10,540
no,
you would wig.

1454
01:10:10,720 --> 01:10:11,600
This is,
um,

1455
01:10:13,060 --> 01:10:14,310
um,
this is how you spell it.

1456
01:10:14,311 --> 01:10:19,110
It's P a.
P.

1457
01:10:19,110 --> 01:10:19,110
A.
K.

1458
01:10:19,110 --> 01:10:19,111
H.
A pup.

1459
01:10:19,111 --> 01:10:19,944
Hookah.

1460
01:10:21,220 --> 01:10:22,840
Oh God.
Look at that hair.

1461
01:10:23,050 --> 01:10:24,190
Yeah,
that's the same,

1462
01:10:24,700 --> 01:10:27,490
I don't even know if the case,
if you don't want announce a kit that's,

1463
01:10:28,180 --> 01:10:30,580
he actually turned it to the next level.
Phil Spector,

1464
01:10:30,581 --> 01:10:32,890
we're looking at Phil Spector from his 
murder trial.

1465
01:10:32,990 --> 01:10:34,620
It was a horrible story.
Like Phil Spector.

1466
01:10:34,621 --> 01:10:34,870
Specter

1467
01:10:34,870 --> 01:10:37,410
stuck a gun in some chick's mouth.
Wow.

1468
01:10:38,490 --> 01:10:40,920
And killed her.
And apparently that was a,

1469
01:10:40,950 --> 01:10:43,200
something that he had been known to do.
He would,

1470
01:10:43,230 --> 01:10:46,590
he would pull a gun sticking in like an 
artist's mouth,

1471
01:10:47,130 --> 01:10:49,290
you know?
Do you know that there's a lot of people

1472
01:10:49,291 --> 01:10:51,240
that think that Jimmy Hendrix manager 
killed him?

1473
01:10:51,870 --> 01:10:53,190
Yeah.
Yeah.

1474
01:10:53,220 --> 01:10:54,053
And apparently there's like a guy who 
wrote a book guy who was a bodyguard or 

1475
01:10:58,831 --> 01:10:59,664
something or another for a,
someone in the music business back then 

1476
01:11:03,750 --> 01:11:05,250
claimed that that was a,
he wrote,

1477
01:11:05,251 --> 01:11:06,084
uh,
wrote a book about this and claims 

1478
01:11:06,601 --> 01:11:08,400
that's what happened.
That Jimi Hendrix,

1479
01:11:08,401 --> 01:11:10,830
a girlfriend at the time jumped off a 
building.

1480
01:11:10,831 --> 01:11:12,000
She committed suicide and they were 
like,

1481
01:11:12,001 --> 01:11:13,380
now they threw that girl building.

1482
01:11:14,190 --> 01:11:15,420
It's like,
whoa,

1483
01:11:15,660 --> 01:11:16,493
what's the dirt?
Wasn't there a documentary or a movie 

1484
01:11:17,641 --> 01:11:18,930
about it?
Was there,

1485
01:11:19,020 --> 01:11:21,600
I think there might've been,
you know,

1486
01:11:21,660 --> 01:11:25,230
you hear about a guy like Hendrix had 
died at 27 and you go,

1487
01:11:25,231 --> 01:11:26,160
Whoa,
what,

1488
01:11:27,870 --> 01:11:30,210
how was that?
How was he that good?

1489
01:11:30,810 --> 01:11:32,520
How the hell is he had a good at 27.

1490
01:11:33,420 --> 01:11:33,840
Okay.

1491
01:11:33,840 --> 01:11:36,620
Fuck man.
Imagine if you're still alive.

1492
01:11:38,410 --> 01:11:42,110
It would be threatening.
I saw guns and roses,

1493
01:11:42,140 --> 01:11:43,490
uh,
like a month ago.

1494
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:44,833
And uh,
earl guide is like right in the front 

1495
01:11:46,431 --> 01:11:47,264
row.
They played a three and a half hour 

1496
01:11:48,831 --> 01:11:52,490
show.
It was weird seeing him did it.

1497
01:11:52,491 --> 01:11:53,324
Really?
Yeah.

1498
01:11:53,330 --> 01:11:54,163
It was weird seeing him perform.
I tell you that slash still has it that 

1499
01:11:57,040 --> 01:12:00,140
that motherfucker jams three and a half 
hours is insane.

1500
01:12:00,170 --> 01:12:01,003
Yeah.
What's a normal concert for like 

1501
01:12:02,540 --> 01:12:05,940
aerosmith or some shit?
Maybe two hours maybe.

1502
01:12:05,990 --> 01:12:07,700
Maybe it's a long,
it's a long time.

1503
01:12:08,060 --> 01:12:11,240
Three and a half hours if not four 
hours.

1504
01:12:11,300 --> 01:12:12,890
Six hours.
Can I get seven?

1505
01:12:12,891 --> 01:12:15,650
Did I get to heaven?
Well he um,

1506
01:12:16,310 --> 01:12:19,580
he like went to the dark lands and then 
came back like axl rose's,

1507
01:12:19,581 --> 01:12:21,260
a weird guy.
The key,

1508
01:12:21,261 --> 01:12:25,220
he vanished and then returned and now 
they're killing it.

1509
01:12:25,280 --> 01:12:26,113
It's weird.

1510
01:12:27,700 --> 01:12:30,660
Remember when he broke his leg and was 
singing on stage with a uh,

1511
01:12:30,670 --> 01:12:32,410
with a cast on,
on a chair?

1512
01:12:32,500 --> 01:12:33,333
Yeah.
It was weird watching him because when 

1513
01:12:35,201 --> 01:12:36,034
you're that close it's weird seeing 
things that you normally wouldn't even 

1514
01:12:38,201 --> 01:12:39,034
notice.
One thing was after every song he would 

1515
01:12:41,351 --> 01:12:42,184
just go behind this curtain,
come out with a different shirt on and 

1516
01:12:44,351 --> 01:12:48,160
he must have changed t shirts maybe like
20 times in outfits.

1517
01:12:48,161 --> 01:12:51,700
Like you'd have a com.
I have a scarf on this one and wow.

1518
01:12:51,850 --> 01:12:54,100
It's weird.
Yeah.

1519
01:12:54,101 --> 01:12:56,680
That's him with a leg brace on.
Yeah.

1520
01:12:58,040 --> 01:13:00,020
Singing with a leather jacket on.

1521
01:13:01,290 --> 01:13:01,710
Okay.

1522
01:13:01,710 --> 01:13:04,810
It's dual.
Pretty bad ass.

1523
01:13:04,990 --> 01:13:06,420
Who the fuck's ever done that before?
And I know,

1524
01:13:06,421 --> 01:13:10,340
I know Dave Grohl did it while he was 
performing acts alone.

1525
01:13:10,360 --> 01:13:11,890
Dumb has didn't really?
Yeah,

1526
01:13:11,980 --> 01:13:14,380
that's hilarious.
He loaned him his brace.

1527
01:13:14,820 --> 01:13:16,360
That's the throne thing.
Oh,

1528
01:13:16,361 --> 01:13:18,190
the throne.
He ticks around with them.

1529
01:13:18,191 --> 01:13:22,180
How long did axle have to sing on that 
thing for a couple of months,

1530
01:13:22,181 --> 01:13:23,110
I think.
Wow.

1531
01:13:23,111 --> 01:13:24,860
That's crazy.
Girls,

1532
01:13:25,280 --> 01:13:26,113
squads,
people.

1533
01:13:28,150 --> 01:13:30,850
How amazing it was.
Dave's and that he loaned attack,

1534
01:13:30,940 --> 01:13:31,691
so I'm sorry.
Oh,

1535
01:13:31,691 --> 01:13:32,524
other way around.
Well that's both bad ass equally bad 

1536
01:13:34,861 --> 01:13:35,561
ass.
Either way.

1537
01:13:35,561 --> 01:13:39,070
You do it either way.
You pop it back and forth.

1538
01:13:39,790 --> 01:13:40,623
What were you saying,
Brian?

1539
01:13:40,630 --> 01:13:42,550
How bad ass is Dave grohl doubt.
Like he,

1540
01:13:42,720 --> 01:13:47,710
he was the drummer for Nirvana and then 
totally chicken created the foo fighters

1541
01:13:47,711 --> 01:13:50,620
right after Nirvana.
And it's one of the best bands ever,

1542
01:13:50,621 --> 01:13:51,454
you know,
and he's now not even playing drums 

1543
01:13:52,841 --> 01:13:57,160
anymore.
Was he playing drums for Nirvana?

1544
01:13:57,161 --> 01:13:57,994
Yeah,
he was the drummer for Nevada and now 

1545
01:13:58,991 --> 01:13:59,770
he's saying,
well,

1546
01:13:59,770 --> 01:14:00,361
you know,
kind of like,

1547
01:14:00,361 --> 01:14:01,640
yeah,
I could do anything.

1548
01:14:01,680 --> 01:14:03,970
When drummer that you're an guitars of 
the year separate,

1549
01:14:04,490 --> 01:14:05,323
separate,
separate bands and he's a bad 

1550
01:14:07,271 --> 01:14:08,021
motherfucker.
Yeah,

1551
01:14:08,021 --> 01:14:10,150
for sure.
I love the female writers.

1552
01:14:10,360 --> 01:14:12,760
No,
never him once.

1553
01:14:12,880 --> 01:14:13,713
I don't think so.

1554
01:14:15,520 --> 01:14:17,500
Um,
I met one of the other guys in Nirvana.

1555
01:14:17,530 --> 01:14:18,890
Who's the other gentleman?
Uh,

1556
01:14:18,940 --> 01:14:21,550
Pat smear or are you got the guy who 
flies planes?

1557
01:14:21,940 --> 01:14:23,980
I met him at one of the marijuana policy
project,

1558
01:14:24,460 --> 01:14:26,170
which basically,
yeah,

1559
01:14:26,290 --> 01:14:27,123
that gentleman really guitar up and it 
fell and hit him in the head during the 

1560
01:14:30,730 --> 01:14:31,900
mistakes.
Musical words.

1561
01:14:31,960 --> 01:14:34,780
Oh fuck man.
That's terrible.

1562
01:14:35,890 --> 01:14:40,890
I remember when the old days when people
would smash guitars on stage.

1563
01:14:41,321 --> 01:14:44,260
I was like a big deal.
Trent reznor used to do it every,

1564
01:14:44,261 --> 01:14:47,170
I mean,
what the fuck is that about man?

1565
01:14:47,650 --> 01:14:48,483
What was that about?
What was this whole destroying musical 

1566
01:14:50,981 --> 01:14:54,790
instruments thing about [inaudible] man,
we got to break it all down.

1567
01:14:55,000 --> 01:14:56,950
How much trash is fucking guitar,
dude,

1568
01:14:56,980 --> 01:14:57,980
dude,
dude,

1569
01:14:59,560 --> 01:15:04,560
smash slash fuck.
You didn't have any money.

1570
01:15:04,721 --> 01:15:07,870
And you just imagine if you could get 
Jimi Hendrix Guitar.

1571
01:15:07,900 --> 01:15:09,250
Did he smash guitars?
No.

1572
01:15:09,310 --> 01:15:10,143
What do you think?
I got it right here at the first person 

1573
01:15:11,471 --> 01:15:13,120
to do it,
or at least credited with,

1574
01:15:13,680 --> 01:15:17,050
let me think.
1960 so I'm still only hand Jimi Hendrix

1575
01:15:17,051 --> 01:15:18,520
burned his guitar.
Yeah,

1576
01:15:18,521 --> 01:15:19,354
he burned it.

1577
01:15:20,140 --> 01:15:20,610
Yeah,

1578
01:15:20,610 --> 01:15:21,960
I'd say the first person wouldn't be 
like,

1579
01:15:21,961 --> 01:15:23,340
yeah,
I feel like he smashed it to,

1580
01:15:23,341 --> 01:15:25,100
yeah,
I would say he's smashed guitars.

1581
01:15:25,110 --> 01:15:26,280
Hidden.
He smash at Jamie.

1582
01:15:26,670 --> 01:15:29,280
I don't know that he didn't add up.
I'll look up hendricks just for sure,

1583
01:15:29,281 --> 01:15:31,260
but I got the guy that,
the first guy who's got,

1584
01:15:31,350 --> 01:15:33,090
who was the first coffee towns in it.
Oh,

1585
01:15:33,091 --> 01:15:34,560
of course.
That's right.

1586
01:15:35,070 --> 01:15:37,050
That's right.
Pete towns and do it.

1587
01:15:37,051 --> 01:15:38,640
You know what?
I might be fucking this up.

1588
01:15:39,600 --> 01:15:41,400
Jimmy Hendrix might not have smashed 
guitar.

1589
01:15:41,430 --> 01:15:42,263
It might've just been townsend didn't 
someone and kiss that ace freely of her 

1590
01:15:46,171 --> 01:15:48,630
smash guitars.
Here's Monterey pop festival.

1591
01:15:48,640 --> 01:15:51,360
Like Jimmy lit it on fire and smashed 
it.

1592
01:15:52,020 --> 01:15:53,460
Oh Man.
He was high as fuck.

1593
01:15:53,461 --> 01:15:54,960
Yeah,
just hitting everything.

1594
01:15:55,810 --> 01:15:56,140
Yeah.

1595
01:15:56,140 --> 01:15:59,480
Some weak ass lambs.
He got to work on your,

1596
01:16:00,050 --> 01:16:01,230
oh no,
I know.

1597
01:16:01,540 --> 01:16:05,210
Oh yeah.
He can't move in those fucking pants,

1598
01:16:05,570 --> 01:16:06,410
those pants,
man.

1599
01:16:06,411 --> 01:16:09,980
These tickets constrict your deck.
So I know these guys had kids.

1600
01:16:10,070 --> 01:16:12,500
Lenny Kravitz,
his pants ripped open.

1601
01:16:12,620 --> 01:16:13,453
Yeah,
that's right.

1602
01:16:14,770 --> 01:16:17,870
Long for [inaudible] death.
Hank can fly.

1603
01:16:18,290 --> 01:16:19,490
Jimi Hendrix was,
uh,

1604
01:16:20,030 --> 01:16:22,070
he was wearing those,
those are jeans,

1605
01:16:22,400 --> 01:16:23,870
like jeans,
that tight man.

1606
01:16:23,871 --> 01:16:24,704
You can't do shit in those things.
You definitely can't smash guitars 

1607
01:16:28,070 --> 01:16:28,903
correctly.

1608
01:16:29,840 --> 01:16:30,450
Okay,

1609
01:16:30,450 --> 01:16:32,340
so he smashed guitars a bunch of times.

1610
01:16:33,420 --> 01:16:33,830
Yeah,

1611
01:16:33,830 --> 01:16:34,401
yeah,
yeah.

1612
01:16:34,401 --> 01:16:35,990
This has to go to the feeling of the 
music you're getting,

1613
01:16:35,991 --> 01:16:37,070
man.
You just get into it.

1614
01:16:37,100 --> 01:16:38,930
Yeah.
Plus you're on acid,

1615
01:16:38,931 --> 01:16:39,410
right?
Yeah.

1616
01:16:39,410 --> 01:16:42,650
Also,
he's on acid a lot during this time.

1617
01:16:42,700 --> 01:16:44,180
It wasn't any,
wow,

1618
01:16:44,750 --> 01:16:47,660
look at this.
They just let him smash these things.

1619
01:16:47,710 --> 01:16:50,720
Here's a guitar sacrifice.
So like a guy like Matt,

1620
01:16:50,721 --> 01:16:51,554
thea mortal Brown and Jimi Hendrix swing
that guitars like just needs a little 

1621
01:16:54,621 --> 01:16:55,730
coaching.
He used to like,

1622
01:16:56,090 --> 01:16:58,970
that's like a big exercise they use with
macy's and shit.

1623
01:16:59,240 --> 01:17:00,073
You know,
that's like hitting tires with 

1624
01:17:01,431 --> 01:17:03,830
sledgehammers.
That's an excellent form of exercise.

1625
01:17:04,200 --> 01:17:06,410
Now try to find nickelback smashing 
guitars.

1626
01:17:06,450 --> 01:17:09,890
Not going to happen.
Maybe I'm going to be on nickelback.

1627
01:17:10,820 --> 01:17:15,820
I don't,
I don't think they're bad but I,

1628
01:17:17,281 --> 01:17:18,114
I accept that you don't like it.
I just feel like as I move into 2018 I 

1629
01:17:22,641 --> 01:17:25,460
want to spend more time positive on 
things I like.

1630
01:17:25,550 --> 01:17:29,600
Then things I don't like and more time.
If there are things that I don't like,

1631
01:17:29,720 --> 01:17:34,430
I want to be able to look at them in a 
more relaxed manner and it'd be less,

1632
01:17:34,460 --> 01:17:35,293
less engaged with it and more,
more just as long as you're not hurting 

1633
01:17:39,561 --> 01:17:41,420
anybody,
just have fun.

1634
01:17:41,900 --> 01:17:42,733
Who gives a shit?

1635
01:17:43,040 --> 01:17:44,920
Do you read about Will Ferrell?
Uh,

1636
01:17:44,930 --> 01:17:47,690
he did a uh,
rose parade.

1637
01:17:47,830 --> 01:17:48,663
They acted the eight,
he dressed up in a character with this 

1638
01:17:50,121 --> 01:17:51,680
other girl that used to be on Saturday 
night live.

1639
01:17:52,530 --> 01:17:53,363
They acted like local,
like news people doing like showing the 

1640
01:17:56,181 --> 01:17:57,014
parade and they broadcast it live on 
Amazon prime and people thought it was 

1641
01:18:01,791 --> 01:18:02,510
real.
They didn't read.

1642
01:18:02,510 --> 01:18:04,910
A lot of people didn't even realize it 
was will ferrell.

1643
01:18:05,180 --> 01:18:07,280
And so like people are like angry

1644
01:18:07,650 --> 01:18:09,810
about it cause they didn't get the joke.
Oh my God.

1645
01:18:09,811 --> 01:18:11,340
That's hilarious.
He shaved his head.

1646
01:18:12,150 --> 01:18:13,740
He's got prosthetic on or something.
Yeah.

1647
01:18:13,750 --> 01:18:14,880
Yeah.
Oh my God.

1648
01:18:14,881 --> 01:18:15,714
That is amazing.
As fictional local TV hosted dual made 

1649
01:18:18,751 --> 01:18:20,540
jokes about the parades,
marching bands,

1650
01:18:20,550 --> 01:18:24,210
flower covered floats and inaccurate 
historical uniforms.

1651
01:18:24,300 --> 01:18:25,370
Oh my gosh.

1652
01:18:26,460 --> 01:18:27,293
Yeah.
I guess you can get it on Amazon prime 

1653
01:18:28,251 --> 01:18:29,084
right now.
And I guess there was so many one stars 

1654
01:18:31,341 --> 01:18:33,440
and all the reviews are like,
how dare they.

1655
01:18:33,441 --> 01:18:34,820
This is a tradition.

1656
01:18:35,120 --> 01:18:36,770
Oh my God.
That's hilarious.

1657
01:18:36,771 --> 01:18:39,500
These local news people.
That is so funny.

1658
01:18:39,830 --> 01:18:40,663
That's so funny.
Will Ferrell's fucking anybody who says 

1659
01:18:42,441 --> 01:18:45,320
will Ferrell's not funny.
I can't talk to over 1,001

1660
01:18:45,321 --> 01:18:46,680
stars on it.
Yeah,

1661
01:18:46,730 --> 01:18:47,563
I just can't.
I can't talk to anybody who doesn't 

1662
01:18:49,071 --> 01:18:50,500
think that guys hilarious.
Yeah,

1663
01:18:50,840 --> 01:18:51,673
there's certain,
see I just contradicted what I said 

1664
01:18:52,641 --> 01:18:53,840
earlier.
You don't have,

1665
01:18:53,870 --> 01:18:55,370
you can like whatever you want.
I don't care.

1666
01:18:55,940 --> 01:18:57,470
Meanwhile I'm like,
except Will Ferrell.

1667
01:18:58,150 --> 01:18:59,380
Fuck for me.
Towel.

1668
01:18:59,381 --> 01:19:00,171
Dig In nights,
man,

1669
01:19:00,171 --> 01:19:01,880
when he's running around in his 
underwear,

1670
01:19:02,060 --> 01:19:03,260
he's saying,
Tom Cruise,

1671
01:19:03,261 --> 01:19:06,440
use your witchcraft.
I'm crying,

1672
01:19:06,580 --> 01:19:09,160
you know,
that's based off a real thing.

1673
01:19:09,490 --> 01:19:14,490
If him running out thinking he's on fire
because there was a famous car like,

1674
01:19:14,710 --> 01:19:17,350
like what's that petroleum where it's 
like,

1675
01:19:17,590 --> 01:19:18,423
uh,
you can't see petroleum when it's on 

1676
01:19:19,691 --> 01:19:22,870
fire at petroleum fire.
It's clear or it's invisible.

1677
01:19:23,220 --> 01:19:26,580
And so this famous race car driver.
Yeah.

1678
01:19:26,990 --> 01:19:30,250
If there was a fire in his car but you 
couldn't see it.

1679
01:19:30,251 --> 01:19:31,540
So He's like,
I'm on fire.

1680
01:19:31,541 --> 01:19:34,270
But to everyone else it looked like he 
was just a crazy person.

1681
01:19:34,480 --> 01:19:35,313
I think this might be it.
I see like all these people are on fire 

1682
01:19:37,271 --> 01:19:41,650
right now and he can't even tell uh,
there there's a fire.

1683
01:19:42,010 --> 01:19:44,650
Oh Wow.
Cause Petroleum fire,

1684
01:19:44,890 --> 01:19:47,230
you can't see,
Whoa,

1685
01:19:47,290 --> 01:19:50,080
what?
Yeah.

1686
01:19:50,260 --> 01:19:52,530
Oh my God,
I didn't know that whole seat.

1687
01:19:53,030 --> 01:19:53,863
No,
this,

1688
01:19:57,520 --> 01:19:58,353
yeah,
you can't not see trillium firing can 

1689
01:20:00,401 --> 01:20:02,890
only see at night.
Oh my God,

1690
01:20:02,891 --> 01:20:04,030
that is insane.

1691
01:20:04,380 --> 01:20:07,290
So all these people are on fire and 
they're running from invisible fire.

1692
01:20:07,580 --> 01:20:08,110
Oh my

1693
01:20:08,110 --> 01:20:10,500
God.
How am I just now learning this?

1694
01:20:10,770 --> 01:20:15,210
You can't see petroleum fire.
Is that real?

1695
01:20:15,260 --> 01:20:18,900
Yeah.
You only at night there has to be really

1696
01:20:18,901 --> 01:20:20,940
dark cause it's like this,
the light blue part of it.

1697
01:20:21,030 --> 01:20:23,910
Oh my God,
get any orange or anything so fucked.

1698
01:20:24,900 --> 01:20:25,733
But how hilarious is it that was based 
on a real and so he has flame retardant 

1699
01:20:29,941 --> 01:20:32,760
clothes on so that stuff doesn't catch 
fire.

1700
01:20:32,890 --> 01:20:34,340
Right.
This is a skin.

1701
01:20:34,341 --> 01:20:36,240
It's getting it.
Oh my God.

1702
01:20:36,330 --> 01:20:37,890
Oh my God.
How are [inaudible]?

1703
01:20:37,920 --> 01:20:40,080
And it got into the crowd too.
Like people are like,

1704
01:20:40,081 --> 01:20:45,081
why is everyone freaking out?
Oh here's another radio lab plug.

1705
01:20:46,050 --> 01:20:48,090
I was listening this thing about ball 
lightning.

1706
01:20:48,540 --> 01:20:53,390
I sit here right now,
he'll catch it on fire and uh,

1707
01:20:53,970 --> 01:20:57,900
see how much fire,
Ooh.

1708
01:20:58,330 --> 01:21:00,600
So that's your nose.
See like right there.

1709
01:21:00,900 --> 01:21:02,910
You can't tell it's on fire right there.
Yeah.

1710
01:21:03,090 --> 01:21:05,730
That's insane.
That's insane dude.

1711
01:21:05,760 --> 01:21:06,593
Oh my God.
He just dropped something in it 

1712
01:21:07,590 --> 01:21:08,790
instantly caught fire.

1713
01:21:10,190 --> 01:21:11,023
Wow.
That's why petroleum fires are a 

1714
01:21:13,370 --> 01:21:16,010
dangerous for firemen and stuff like 
that.

1715
01:21:16,040 --> 01:21:18,320
Cause you can't see,
how do I not know that?

1716
01:21:18,440 --> 01:21:23,440
I can't believe I woke up today on 
January 2nd,

1717
01:21:25,020 --> 01:21:29,930
2018 I learned that for the first time.
I should have known that I'm not woke,

1718
01:21:30,740 --> 01:21:31,573
not vogue.
That's Hashtag not woke that you're a 

1719
01:21:34,301 --> 01:21:38,450
Hashtag blessed Hashtag blessed but not 
Hashtag woke up today.

1720
01:21:38,451 --> 01:21:40,070
I didn't know about petroleum fires.

1721
01:21:41,830 --> 01:21:43,390
It's crazy that you could just buy a 
lighter.

1722
01:21:43,630 --> 01:21:44,463
You know what?
Talk about like what's the possibility 

1723
01:21:46,301 --> 01:21:50,320
of people being fucked up it way less 
than you think because like lighters are

1724
01:21:50,321 --> 01:21:55,321
everywhere and this relatively few fires
in comparison to the number of lighters.

1725
01:21:56,320 --> 01:21:57,910
You know,
like everybody's got a fucking lighter.

1726
01:21:57,911 --> 01:22:01,120
Everybody we know has a lighter and was 
the last time someone window let,

1727
01:22:01,130 --> 01:22:03,850
let some shit on fire.
Right?

1728
01:22:06,240 --> 01:22:07,350
It is weird.
It's weird.

1729
01:22:07,440 --> 01:22:08,273
It's weird.
But like the real weirdness about 

1730
01:22:10,651 --> 01:22:12,720
driving cars is how few accidents there 
are.

1731
01:22:13,050 --> 01:22:15,240
That's the real weirdness.
Of course,

1732
01:22:15,241 --> 01:22:19,350
it's going to be some and more so with 
these fucking assholes on their phones.

1733
01:22:19,500 --> 01:22:22,470
God Damn.
I've been seeing some drifters.

1734
01:22:22,770 --> 01:22:25,950
Some people drift in lanes and texting 
while they're driving.

1735
01:22:25,951 --> 01:22:27,640
Holy Shit.
That's common.

1736
01:22:29,220 --> 01:22:30,053
But take that away.
And it's remarkable how rarely we slam 

1737
01:22:33,391 --> 01:22:35,100
into each other.
It's remarkable.

1738
01:22:35,250 --> 01:22:37,620
You can go years without a car accident 
if you're careful.

1739
01:22:37,680 --> 01:22:39,000
Years and years and years.

1740
01:22:39,720 --> 01:22:40,553
Fuck man.

1741
01:22:42,890 --> 01:22:44,430
Can I say in this city?
Yeah,

1742
01:22:45,060 --> 01:22:47,640
some remarkable,
but you know they happen.

1743
01:22:48,450 --> 01:22:49,283
They definitely happen.
There's no way right now they can tell 

1744
01:22:52,111 --> 01:22:55,950
exactly what you were doing.
They just know what happened.

1745
01:22:57,030 --> 01:23:02,010
But if there's a way that they can put 
one of those scent,

1746
01:23:02,040 --> 01:23:02,873
you know how they have,
don't they have onstar now and a lot of 

1747
01:23:04,441 --> 01:23:05,274
cars you buy him like from the factory 
and they have that onstar thing where 

1748
01:23:08,811 --> 01:23:11,110
you,
you could actually like have comp calls,

1749
01:23:11,170 --> 01:23:15,580
like make phone calls with the whatever 
it is on the other line.

1750
01:23:15,610 --> 01:23:16,443
Like you could say,
hey can you book me a reservation at 

1751
01:23:17,861 --> 01:23:18,694
restaurant?
Like they're also monitoring how fast 

1752
01:23:21,071 --> 01:23:21,904
your car's going.
They're monitoring like certain certain 

1753
01:23:26,410 --> 01:23:27,243
metrics,
certain things they could figure out 

1754
01:23:28,601 --> 01:23:30,820
like what happened when you were causing
an accident?

1755
01:23:30,821 --> 01:23:32,490
Where'd you go?
Where'd you drive to?

1756
01:23:33,480 --> 01:23:37,890
Like if they could track you and GPS and
at a certain point in time they're going

1757
01:23:37,891 --> 01:23:39,160
to be like,
why can't we just film him?

1758
01:23:40,490 --> 01:23:42,730
This is going to film you all the time 
inside your car.

1759
01:23:42,731 --> 01:23:44,830
And like if you want to drive a 
cadillac,

1760
01:23:44,831 --> 01:23:46,150
don't have any fucking orgies in it

1761
01:23:46,720 --> 01:23:47,553
cause it's great cause we have to film 
you because otherwise we're never going 

1762
01:23:50,301 --> 01:23:52,640
to know what the fuck you did to cause 
his car accident.

1763
01:23:52,920 --> 01:23:55,490
We don't want to get sued.
Ultima bail is the ultimate bill has the

1764
01:23:55,491 --> 01:23:56,324
camera.
So like if you're doing the lane 

1765
01:23:57,771 --> 01:23:58,604
departure setting,
it detects if you're not paying 

1766
01:24:00,861 --> 01:24:04,670
attention.
So then by tracking your face,

1767
01:24:04,820 --> 01:24:07,280
so there's a camera and I think it's 
oldsmobiles now.

1768
01:24:07,310 --> 01:24:10,250
Wow.
Well that's sort of like the iphone x or

1769
01:24:10,251 --> 01:24:12,410
10 right?
It sees your face,

1770
01:24:12,510 --> 01:24:13,343
recognize your face to open up your a 
password and it works pretty fucking 

1771
01:24:16,161 --> 01:24:17,660
good.
It's not perfect,

1772
01:24:17,720 --> 01:24:18,553
but it's like whoa.
It's a lot better than I thought it was 

1773
01:24:20,001 --> 01:24:23,540
going to be a lot smoother.
I got this phone when I couldn't find my

1774
01:24:23,541 --> 01:24:24,374
glasses and I found them the other day 
and I have a beard now and add a 

1775
01:24:26,991 --> 01:24:28,850
stocking hat on,
still unlocks it.

1776
01:24:29,060 --> 01:24:31,610
It's like how the hell does it go 
through all those things.

1777
01:24:31,730 --> 01:24:35,120
What would change if someone gained or 
lost weight?

1778
01:24:35,570 --> 01:24:37,340
Would anything change?
I don't think so.

1779
01:24:37,341 --> 01:24:40,160
I think the texts like how far your eyes
are a part,

1780
01:24:40,161 --> 01:24:41,780
you know,
and like little things like that.

1781
01:24:41,810 --> 01:24:42,643
Like I think my,
what's weird is I have a Amazon Echo in 

1782
01:24:46,431 --> 01:24:49,300
my next to my bed now cause it's like 
the best alarm clock average.

1783
01:24:49,310 --> 01:24:51,710
Like it's one of those things where you 
go like Alexa,

1784
01:24:51,740 --> 01:24:53,090
you know,
and uh,

1785
01:24:53,400 --> 01:24:55,400
but it has a camera on it.
Yeah.

1786
01:24:55,401 --> 01:24:56,840
It's watching them for sure.
Yeah.

1787
01:24:57,530 --> 01:24:59,690
Nice.
Is watching your your whole life.

1788
01:24:59,850 --> 01:25:00,683
I'm like keep an eye on me Alexa.
Every time you beat off Alexa makes a 

1789
01:25:03,891 --> 01:25:06,710
checkmark right next to you.
It is weird though.

1790
01:25:06,790 --> 01:25:10,430
Like we'll be just sleeping all the 
night and Alexa will just be like,

1791
01:25:10,640 --> 01:25:11,840
I can't understand what you're talking 
about.

1792
01:25:11,840 --> 01:25:13,160
And you're like,
well I didn't say anything.

1793
01:25:13,610 --> 01:25:17,030
Luxembourg.
She'll just start coming to life.

1794
01:25:17,540 --> 01:25:19,610
She's starting to wake up,
she's becoming more woke.

1795
01:25:19,611 --> 01:25:24,611
To me the best is if you go Alexa rap 
and does this wrap,

1796
01:25:25,660 --> 01:25:28,640
it's could do a wrap and it's a good 
rap.

1797
01:25:29,390 --> 01:25:30,980
Yeah.
We were talking before the podcast,

1798
01:25:31,130 --> 01:25:32,010
there was a,
uh,

1799
01:25:32,090 --> 01:25:32,923
it's a good rap.
We were talking before the podcast is 

1800
01:25:36,080 --> 01:25:39,290
there was something about an apple 
buying Netflix when Jesus,

1801
01:25:39,291 --> 01:25:40,124
yeah.
How do you feel about a company that 

1802
01:25:40,881 --> 01:25:41,714
gets that big?
Like how do you feel about like any 

1803
01:25:43,521 --> 01:25:45,680
company that does a buys up everything,
you know,

1804
01:25:45,681 --> 01:25:46,850
they just,
Disney,

1805
01:25:47,600 --> 01:25:50,260
Disney bought up star wars.
What else?

1806
01:25:50,280 --> 01:25:51,113
They buy out.
Didn't they just buy the other movie 

1807
01:25:52,641 --> 01:25:53,970
studio owns,
uh,

1808
01:25:54,170 --> 01:25:56,800
the avengers or whatever.
A pmr.

1809
01:25:57,070 --> 01:25:57,903
Paramont I dunno.
I don't know if there were a lot of 

1810
01:25:59,451 --> 01:26:02,840
money.
$52 billion to buy 21st century.

1811
01:26:03,490 --> 01:26:04,323
Yeah.
So now like the Marvel Universe is 

1812
01:26:06,381 --> 01:26:09,500
complete I think now is it bad?

1813
01:26:10,020 --> 01:26:12,990
Is it bad to have giant companies?
Some people would say yes.

1814
01:26:12,991 --> 01:26:14,550
Right?
What about a giant company?

1815
01:26:14,551 --> 01:26:17,520
Like Google seems to be a pretty God 
damn good company.

1816
01:26:17,910 --> 01:26:20,990
Like as far as like the way they treat 
people,

1817
01:26:21,940 --> 01:26:25,260
it's supposed to be like pretty good.
Other than that James Damore memo thing,

1818
01:26:25,261 --> 01:26:28,740
that the thing that went out,
remember that that whole,

1819
01:26:28,741 --> 01:26:29,574
uh,
where the guy was talking about why 

1820
01:26:30,691 --> 01:26:33,150
there aren't women in tech and what 
would encourage them.

1821
01:26:33,151 --> 01:26:35,730
And a lot of people said he was sexist 
and it got crazy and I was like,

1822
01:26:36,040 --> 01:26:37,920
then I had to read it like a couple of 
times ago.

1823
01:26:38,670 --> 01:26:41,520
It's like one or two things.
It might be misconstrued as being sexist

1824
01:26:41,521 --> 01:26:44,550
because of the term neuroticism and he,
I think he believes,

1825
01:26:44,640 --> 01:26:49,020
I believe he uses the term neurotic but 
really super duper controversial fucking

1826
01:26:49,021 --> 01:26:52,050
thing and although I don't agree with 
it,

1827
01:26:52,800 --> 01:26:54,420
Google firing the guy,
I kind of get it.

1828
01:26:55,080 --> 01:26:57,480
I get where they are just to kind of 
calm everyone's nerves.

1829
01:26:57,510 --> 01:26:59,310
I don't,
I don't agree with that at all,

1830
01:26:59,370 --> 01:27:02,190
but I understand why they as a 
corporation would think that way,

1831
01:27:02,400 --> 01:27:06,180
but for the most part I seem to,
I like what they're doing.

1832
01:27:06,210 --> 01:27:09,420
Like they're,
they're buying up all these robotics and

1833
01:27:10,830 --> 01:27:13,560
these different corporations that are 
creating the google.

1834
01:27:13,561 --> 01:27:15,300
Didn't Google buy up Boston

1835
01:27:15,300 --> 01:27:16,800
dynamics already sold it though.
Yeah,

1836
01:27:16,801 --> 01:27:18,540
they sold it.
They bought it and then sold it.

1837
01:27:18,541 --> 01:27:19,980
Still all the secrets.
Interesting.

1838
01:27:20,220 --> 01:27:21,053
I wonder if that's what they do because 
you don't hear about the sale when they 

1839
01:27:22,681 --> 01:27:23,880
get rid of something like that.
Yeah.

1840
01:27:24,330 --> 01:27:25,290
Purchase requisite.
Yeah.

1841
01:27:25,291 --> 01:27:28,520
You sell it and then you make sure that 
you don't sign some sort of uh,

1842
01:27:28,980 --> 01:27:29,813
you know,
noncompete clause and could have often 

1843
01:27:31,081 --> 01:27:33,570
done it to buy a purse and there 
might've been someone working there they

1844
01:27:33,571 --> 01:27:35,280
wanted to have on their team.
And so they just,

1845
01:27:35,310 --> 01:27:36,143
ah,
well by your whole company now you work 

1846
01:27:36,961 --> 01:27:37,990
for us.
Whoa,

1847
01:27:38,370 --> 01:27:41,550
that's some fucking game of thrones type
shit with silicone.

1848
01:27:41,970 --> 01:27:42,990
Disney was smart,
Dubai,

1849
01:27:43,080 --> 01:27:46,800
Hulu because they just pulled all their 
stuff off and Netflix,

1850
01:27:47,220 --> 01:27:48,053
all Disney,
I think Disney often flood and now 

1851
01:27:50,671 --> 01:27:51,960
they're just going to put it all on 
Hulu,

1852
01:27:52,260 --> 01:27:54,810
which is awesome cause I left Hulu.
But here's the thing,

1853
01:27:54,850 --> 01:27:56,620
question,
like is that,

1854
01:27:56,680 --> 01:27:57,513
is it,
is it possible to be as big as Google 

1855
01:28:00,490 --> 01:28:03,380
and not be scary?
Right.

1856
01:28:03,390 --> 01:28:06,080
And when something gets so big that the 
controls so much,

1857
01:28:06,380 --> 01:28:08,870
people like tend to just immediately get
wary.

1858
01:28:08,871 --> 01:28:11,360
Like whoa,
like this is the whole market,

1859
01:28:12,440 --> 01:28:13,273
right?
If there's only one way you can get the 

1860
01:28:14,271 --> 01:28:17,960
Internet for verizon was the only 
Internet provider on planet earth,

1861
01:28:18,320 --> 01:28:19,131
that's it.
We'd be like,

1862
01:28:19,131 --> 01:28:21,470
Hey,
that just you,

1863
01:28:21,740 --> 01:28:25,760
just you.
So if that's that because it's too big,

1864
01:28:25,761 --> 01:28:27,050
right.
Controls too much.

1865
01:28:28,700 --> 01:28:32,330
It's like what's the level we're 
comfortable with apple,

1866
01:28:32,910 --> 01:28:34,790
with apple?
It depends on the company also,

1867
01:28:34,791 --> 01:28:35,511
I think,
you know,

1868
01:28:35,511 --> 01:28:38,150
like I think a lot of people trust 
Google and apple.

1869
01:28:38,180 --> 01:28:40,760
Apple put the nets over the buildings 
when the people were jumping and did the

1870
01:28:40,761 --> 01:28:43,190
right thing.
She didn't think with the batteries they

1871
01:28:43,191 --> 01:28:44,024
did the response.
I got to see that battery thing is 

1872
01:28:46,371 --> 01:28:47,670
crazy.
We got to talk about that.

1873
01:28:47,860 --> 01:28:51,590
How many years ago did we start talking 
about who called?

1874
01:28:51,930 --> 01:28:52,763
You called it in like whatever the first
year of the fucking knew it was when 

1875
01:28:57,111 --> 01:28:58,640
they had a new iphone and then the new,
uh,

1876
01:28:58,700 --> 01:29:01,860
new new iphone.
As soon as the new new iphone came out,

1877
01:29:01,861 --> 01:29:01,980
you

1878
01:29:01,980 --> 01:29:02,813
were like,
I know what these mother fuckers are 

1879
01:29:03,511 --> 01:29:04,344
doing.

1880
01:29:04,450 --> 01:29:05,283
Yeah.
But I get their excuse and it wasn't 

1881
01:29:06,580 --> 01:29:06,790
like,
yeah,

1882
01:29:06,790 --> 01:29:09,340
to lock.
It might've been like two I phones and I

1883
01:29:09,341 --> 01:29:10,900
want to be honest about this.
I don't remember.

1884
01:29:11,350 --> 01:29:14,290
I don't remember.
But I remember there was a time that you

1885
01:29:14,291 --> 01:29:15,940
called it first way before everybody 
else.

1886
01:29:15,941 --> 01:29:18,160
I was like,
Brian's all paranoid about technology.

1887
01:29:19,250 --> 01:29:22,850
I understand their excuse.
So I get what they're saying.

1888
01:29:23,030 --> 01:29:23,863
I mean there,
if the batteries are going to start 

1889
01:29:25,401 --> 01:29:26,520
failing because it's,

1890
01:29:26,610 --> 01:29:30,120
you can't have the is all fucked up in a
battery.

1891
01:29:30,480 --> 01:29:31,313
But to deny that they know that the 
throttling down of performance of the 

1892
01:29:35,101 --> 01:29:38,670
phone's not going to influence people 
into deciding,

1893
01:29:38,700 --> 01:29:41,160
deciding to buy a new phone is 
ridiculous.

1894
01:29:41,161 --> 01:29:41,741
Yeah,
you are.

1895
01:29:41,741 --> 01:29:44,140
You are literally disabling the phone.
You're,

1896
01:29:44,910 --> 01:29:47,580
and you're not doing your customer 
service base.

1897
01:29:48,360 --> 01:29:51,240
You're not doing them a service.
Because if you were,

1898
01:29:51,241 --> 01:29:54,360
if you really cared about them getting 
the best stuff all the time,

1899
01:29:54,361 --> 01:29:57,180
what you would do is he would say,
Hey,

1900
01:29:57,780 --> 01:30:00,480
um,
these batteries are going to get older.

1901
01:30:00,481 --> 01:30:01,314
If you want to continue your phones,
here's a new battery to reasonable rate 

1902
01:30:04,350 --> 01:30:08,220
other wise,
we have to throttle down the performance

1903
01:30:08,221 --> 01:30:10,710
of your phone so that you can get a 
day's use out of it.

1904
01:30:11,490 --> 01:30:14,700
But that can be avoided by simply 
swapping out the battery.

1905
01:30:15,330 --> 01:30:17,610
So this is what happens when your phone 
gets to be a year old yet

1906
01:30:18,280 --> 01:30:19,900
that,
that's sort of disingenuous.

1907
01:30:19,901 --> 01:30:21,580
Right.
And the batteries were so expensive.

1908
01:30:21,581 --> 01:30:23,550
Now I think they got them down to $29

1909
01:30:24,180 --> 01:30:27,690
but that's just in response to getting 
in this situation right now.

1910
01:30:28,640 --> 01:30:32,300
I think they make amazing shit.
This iphone 10 x,

1911
01:30:32,301 --> 01:30:34,650
whatever the fuck they want to call it.
It's amazing.

1912
01:30:34,820 --> 01:30:35,653
It's like,
it's crazy that there's a company that 

1913
01:30:36,621 --> 01:30:39,050
makes something like that.
They're going to make some mistakes.

1914
01:30:39,350 --> 01:30:42,650
I don't know who approved that mistake,
but that's a mistake.

1915
01:30:42,651 --> 01:30:45,830
They shouldn't have done that.
But the stuff they make is,

1916
01:30:46,250 --> 01:30:47,083
it's someone's got to do that.
It's not going to be like the Brian and 

1917
01:30:49,221 --> 01:30:50,390
Joe Corporation.
Right.

1918
01:30:50,530 --> 01:30:51,363
You know?
I mean you need something with massive 

1919
01:30:53,721 --> 01:30:54,554
resources and a ton of shit fuck ton of 
people to be able to put together the 

1920
01:30:58,311 --> 01:30:59,144
cash to make an iphone 10 I mean this,
you got to hire a lot of fucking people 

1921
01:31:04,401 --> 01:31:05,234
to make this thing right.
You got a higher wizards and sorcerers 

1922
01:31:10,070 --> 01:31:10,903
and God damn silicone geniuses and 
people know how to get lithium ion 

1923
01:31:16,551 --> 01:31:20,360
batteries thinner than your fucking 
fingernail in these things.

1924
01:31:20,750 --> 01:31:22,280
Nothing in your fingernail.
Right at the end of that,

1925
01:31:22,281 --> 01:31:23,450
a finger.
What's like,

1926
01:31:23,480 --> 01:31:24,460
how thick is a,
well,

1927
01:31:24,461 --> 01:31:26,570
it can't be that thick.
The shit has a case on it.

1928
01:31:28,160 --> 01:31:30,380
Like how thin is a a battery and a cell 
phone?

1929
01:31:30,720 --> 01:31:35,720
It's a pretty thin like paper chip or a 
potato chip rather like a flat potato.

1930
01:31:37,101 --> 01:31:38,990
If you ever could flatten out a potato 
chip,

1931
01:31:40,290 --> 01:31:41,820
it's a little thicker than that.
Actually.

1932
01:31:42,720 --> 01:31:43,553
What's crazy though is that I,
the the phone before this iphone seven 

1933
01:31:46,410 --> 01:31:49,530
plus s whatever the fuck it was,
when we owe debt,

1934
01:31:49,950 --> 01:31:52,200
when I download the new operating system
on it,

1935
01:31:52,201 --> 01:31:53,880
it was crashy.
It was buggy.

1936
01:31:53,910 --> 01:31:56,730
It fucked up all the time.
But then when I got the iphone x,

1937
01:31:56,731 --> 01:31:58,980
the same operating system,
it worked way better.

1938
01:31:59,230 --> 01:32:02,290
So that's like not anything to do with 
the battery,

1939
01:32:02,470 --> 01:32:03,303
you know,
that's just because they build an 

1940
01:32:04,091 --> 01:32:04,924
operating system around this processor 
and this screen and all the components 

1941
01:32:08,141 --> 01:32:11,080
on this and then they're emulating it 
for all the other phones,

1942
01:32:11,081 --> 01:32:12,700
you know,
or whatever they're doing.

1943
01:32:13,300 --> 01:32:14,140
It's almost like

1944
01:32:14,250 --> 01:32:16,530
the only way to be truly awesome at 
something.

1945
01:32:16,531 --> 01:32:21,531
That's just to be greedy too.
It's like they got to have like,

1946
01:32:22,200 --> 01:32:23,820
we'll get a fuel this motherfucker.
Okay,

1947
01:32:23,850 --> 01:32:24,451
okay.
This is,

1948
01:32:24,451 --> 01:32:25,780
this is projected,
uh,

1949
01:32:25,860 --> 01:32:28,110
sales and we can get that up to about 
20%.

1950
01:32:28,111 --> 01:32:28,944
And this is how we're going to do it.
Do you have the dark secret meetings 

1951
01:32:31,680 --> 01:32:34,890
where they can just add candles?
Went into the fucking basement.

1952
01:32:34,940 --> 01:32:36,540
Nicole,
we're to slow down the old phones.

1953
01:32:36,820 --> 01:32:38,700
No,
don't do it.

1954
01:32:38,701 --> 01:32:39,534
Mark watching for technology.
We've always worked for technology and 

1955
01:32:43,171 --> 01:32:45,300
we can't slow down the fucking phones,
man.

1956
01:32:45,930 --> 01:32:48,300
We're gonna slam down vessel.
I'm down selling the new shit.

1957
01:32:48,330 --> 01:32:49,440
They don't need the new shit.

1958
01:32:50,300 --> 01:32:50,750
Okay.

1959
01:32:50,750 --> 01:32:53,060
It's about information more than it's 
about new apps.

1960
01:32:54,630 --> 01:32:55,770
You've been watching Black Mirror.

1961
01:32:56,210 --> 01:32:58,250
I only watched three episodes,
but I love it.

1962
01:32:58,280 --> 01:33:00,170
You haven't watched the new season of 
watched.

1963
01:33:00,171 --> 01:33:02,600
Uh,
I think one episode in the new season,

1964
01:33:02,601 --> 01:33:03,434
which was the video game episode,
but the guy was in the life video game 

1965
01:33:05,991 --> 01:33:08,420
that was remarkably similar to Arusha 
fears.

1966
01:33:08,630 --> 01:33:09,463
Salvia divinorum trip.
I was done no new season as of like two 

1967
01:33:12,201 --> 01:33:15,350
days ago.
Here's another new days ago.

1968
01:33:15,380 --> 01:33:15,760
Oh,
I know.

1969
01:33:15,760 --> 01:33:18,230
I can't,
I don't have the time for this.

1970
01:33:18,470 --> 01:33:19,303
Uh,
but the,

1971
01:33:19,460 --> 01:33:21,590
the last one I watched was the video 
game one.

1972
01:33:21,620 --> 01:33:22,453
Um,
I'm hooked on the unbreakable Kimmy 

1973
01:33:24,290 --> 01:33:26,540
Schmidt right now on Netflix.
Have you watched it?

1974
01:33:26,960 --> 01:33:28,880
Dude?
That is a funny,

1975
01:33:28,940 --> 01:33:30,620
silly show.
Oh yeah,

1976
01:33:30,621 --> 01:33:31,550
I have seen that.
Yeah.

1977
01:33:31,640 --> 01:33:34,410
The lady,
she was trapped in a bunker for 15 years

1978
01:33:34,411 --> 01:33:35,244
for in a religious cult and she gets out
and she's living in New York City and 

1979
01:33:37,551 --> 01:33:38,870
she doesn't know what the fuck's going 
on.

1980
01:33:39,170 --> 01:33:40,460
It's really funny,
man.

1981
01:33:40,490 --> 01:33:42,650
There's a couple of episodes were kind 
of falls apart,

1982
01:33:42,830 --> 01:33:45,710
but then it bounces back strong.
It's very funny again now.

1983
01:33:45,860 --> 01:33:47,990
It's a really good show.
I'm on like episode,

1984
01:33:47,991 --> 01:33:51,740
uh,
I want to say eight.

1985
01:33:52,010 --> 01:33:53,060
I think I'm on episode eight.

1986
01:33:53,410 --> 01:33:55,620
Black Mirror is getting into some 
trouble cause I guess Carl,

1987
01:33:55,640 --> 01:33:57,670
you know Carl pink pig crow.
Pinkerton.

1988
01:33:57,830 --> 01:34:00,370
Yeah.
Supposedly two things.

1989
01:34:00,371 --> 01:34:03,880
I am two different episodes.
He talks about something that they stole

1990
01:34:03,881 --> 01:34:06,880
in Black Mirror and ou,
which is weird.

1991
01:34:06,940 --> 01:34:08,140
It was in the news today.

1992
01:34:08,800 --> 01:34:09,880
Um hmm.
Well,

1993
01:34:09,881 --> 01:34:12,070
I don't know what the specifics are,
so I don't want to comment,

1994
01:34:12,430 --> 01:34:13,263
but um,
there's a lot of things that black 

1995
01:34:16,271 --> 01:34:18,460
mirror did his subjects that I talked 
about too,

1996
01:34:18,461 --> 01:34:19,294
but it was just because a lot of people 
were talking about potential future 

1997
01:34:22,301 --> 01:34:23,134
technologies,
like this video game thing where they 

1998
01:34:25,091 --> 01:34:25,924
put something in the back of your head,
like the Matrix and plug you into some 

1999
01:34:28,511 --> 01:34:31,420
artificial experience that's 
indistinguishable.

2000
01:34:31,630 --> 01:34:32,463
That's what those,
I've talked about that a hundred times 

2001
01:34:34,090 --> 01:34:35,740
just from being high,
you know,

2002
01:34:35,741 --> 01:34:36,574
and thinking about what are they going 
to be able to do next that's crazier 

2003
01:34:39,131 --> 01:34:42,610
than a Duncan trussell when he had that 
htc vive,

2004
01:34:43,170 --> 01:34:45,050
you put that thing on.
Did you put the thing on I halfway?

2005
01:34:45,370 --> 01:34:45,870
Oh,
you have one?

2006
01:34:45,870 --> 01:34:47,970
Yeah.
Dunkin.

2007
01:34:48,010 --> 01:34:51,010
A hangover is podcasts and I put it off 
for like an hour and a half before I did

2008
01:34:51,011 --> 01:34:51,440
it.
We,

2009
01:34:51,440 --> 01:34:53,650
you do just do you do that and you go,
okay,

2010
01:34:53,651 --> 01:34:55,870
well what's next?
You know,

2011
01:34:56,050 --> 01:34:56,883
so I don't know if Carl just was able to
figure out what's next or are they 

2012
01:35:00,021 --> 01:35:01,190
saying this plagiarism?

2013
01:35:01,300 --> 01:35:02,560
Yeah.
I mean if,

2014
01:35:02,561 --> 01:35:03,394
if,
uh,

2015
01:35:03,510 --> 01:35:04,870
if the,
you have the article,

2016
01:35:04,871 --> 01:35:05,710
Jamie,
if,

2017
01:35:06,070 --> 01:35:06,903
uh,
it seems pretty specific where it's not 

2018
01:35:09,611 --> 01:35:10,001
like,
hey,

2019
01:35:10,001 --> 01:35:11,740
let's tease talking about simulation.
Teary.

2020
01:35:11,741 --> 01:35:12,910
It's more like,
oh,

2021
01:35:12,911 --> 01:35:15,250
he actually had this idea.
I forget what it is.

2022
01:35:15,251 --> 01:35:16,084
I saw it this morning.
Sometimes though it is parallel 

2023
01:35:18,851 --> 01:35:19,684
thinking.
So let's just in the interest of this 

2024
01:35:21,500 --> 01:35:23,230
spoiler alerts in there,
I don't even want to read.

2025
01:35:23,440 --> 01:35:24,273
Okay,
well watch Karl Pink and predict new 

2026
01:35:26,261 --> 01:35:28,390
Black Mirror plots years ahead of time.
Yeah,

2027
01:35:28,391 --> 01:35:29,260
you're right.
We can't,

2028
01:35:29,261 --> 01:35:30,760
we can't bring these out.
So,

2029
01:35:30,761 --> 01:35:31,251
uh,
who,

2030
01:35:31,251 --> 01:35:32,720
who wrote the article,
what's it on?

2031
01:35:33,730 --> 01:35:34,650
Gizmodo.
I love that.

2032
01:35:36,070 --> 01:35:37,010
Very good site.
Yeah.

2033
01:35:37,480 --> 01:35:39,160
And gadgets.
Very good sight.

2034
01:35:39,810 --> 01:35:40,643
He real news.
Do you have like five websites that you 

2035
01:35:43,331 --> 01:35:45,220
just shuffle back and forth?
Like,

2036
01:35:45,221 --> 01:35:48,400
like Gizmodo is one in gadgets when 
Kotaku is one.

2037
01:35:48,401 --> 01:35:52,390
I just signed this one who scientist.
People get mad,

2038
01:35:52,391 --> 01:35:55,360
but I like to read the New York Times.
New York Times.

2039
01:35:55,490 --> 01:35:57,460
He would get mad.
You're like read fake news.

2040
01:35:57,461 --> 01:36:00,100
It's the fucking New York Times.
Okay.

2041
01:36:00,101 --> 01:36:03,820
You cannot just immediately dismissed 
the fucking New York Times.

2042
01:36:03,821 --> 01:36:06,790
You cannot with any mistakes that 
anybody has made ever.

2043
01:36:06,791 --> 01:36:09,640
You cannot fucking dismiss the New York 
Times.

2044
01:36:09,810 --> 01:36:14,810
How dare you.
They're a giant part of what made people

2045
01:36:15,690 --> 01:36:19,560
at this level in terms of our 
understanding of world events,

2046
01:36:19,561 --> 01:36:24,480
a giant part leading to 2017 like if you
look at the history of human beings,

2047
01:36:24,780 --> 01:36:29,780
understanding the reality of a,
a detailed intellectual understanding of

2048
01:36:33,421 --> 01:36:38,421
the reality of certain current world 
events compiled in a daily resource.

2049
01:36:39,270 --> 01:36:40,103
The New York Times change the world.
It offered people super high level 

2050
01:36:45,870 --> 01:36:46,703
information from Uber Smart people on a 
regular basis and to dismiss that and 

2051
01:36:53,581 --> 01:36:55,890
say that that's just as good as any 
other papers that no,

2052
01:36:55,891 --> 01:36:56,080
no,
no.

2053
01:36:56,080 --> 01:36:57,870
There's a is a pursuit.
What they were in,

2054
01:36:57,871 --> 01:37:02,871
they were in a pursuit for excellence in
information.

2055
01:37:03,090 --> 01:37:03,923
Now,
whether or not they've made some 

2056
01:37:04,261 --> 01:37:05,940
mistakes to,
I criticized him for that.

2057
01:37:05,941 --> 01:37:06,774
Conor mcgregor weird thing that they 
said is his face was covered in blood 

2058
01:37:10,531 --> 01:37:11,020
and he was,

2059
01:37:11,020 --> 01:37:12,520
and they fixed it immediately.
Yeah.

2060
01:37:12,521 --> 01:37:13,620
They said he'd be almost fell

2061
01:37:13,620 --> 01:37:16,530
through the ropes before the rescue.
The referee rescued them like,

2062
01:37:16,531 --> 01:37:17,460
I won't eat it.
You don't have to.

2063
01:37:17,640 --> 01:37:20,940
He got his ass kicked.
You have to make anything up like that.

2064
01:37:21,030 --> 01:37:21,863
What happened was amazing.
You don't have to embellish it just to 

2065
01:37:25,231 --> 01:37:26,850
make your magazine.
This is crazy.

2066
01:37:26,851 --> 01:37:29,250
Like you can't do that.
You're the New York Times,

2067
01:37:29,460 --> 01:37:31,290
like in,
especially in this day and age,

2068
01:37:31,800 --> 01:37:33,810
you got to resist and you gotta be,
I'm rubber.

2069
01:37:33,811 --> 01:37:35,460
You're glue.
You can't even respond.

2070
01:37:35,670 --> 01:37:38,400
You can't and you can't put out anything
fake.

2071
01:37:38,490 --> 01:37:39,810
You just can't,
you know?

2072
01:37:39,840 --> 01:37:40,580
But people that go,
oh,

2073
01:37:40,580 --> 01:37:44,700
the New York Times is fake news.
Like they've been around for so long.

2074
01:37:44,701 --> 01:37:47,070
Do you know how much important shit they
put out?

2075
01:37:47,220 --> 01:37:49,440
If you're going to just dismiss them 
because you love trump,

2076
01:37:49,480 --> 01:37:50,910
is that you're really willing to do 
that.

2077
01:37:51,570 --> 01:37:52,403
That's,
that's as crazy as anything I've ever 

2078
01:37:53,461 --> 01:37:54,930
heard.
You can't do that.

2079
01:37:55,830 --> 01:37:57,600
Like they can't be exonerated.
I mean,

2080
01:37:57,790 --> 01:37:58,623
they can be exonerated,
but they can't be exempt from not being 

2081
01:38:01,681 --> 01:38:04,020
called out by printing something.
That's not true.

2082
01:38:04,170 --> 01:38:05,003
They,
everyone should be held up the same 

2083
01:38:06,031 --> 01:38:08,260
standards.
But if you don't appreciate what the,

2084
01:38:08,360 --> 01:38:11,370
The New York Times has done,
that seems crazy to me.

2085
01:38:12,090 --> 01:38:14,790
It's just they're really important.

2086
01:38:15,720 --> 01:38:19,740
Could you see all the trump like global 
warming tweets?

2087
01:38:20,220 --> 01:38:22,010
Like he doesn't really understand global
warming.

2088
01:38:22,011 --> 01:38:25,650
He's trolling scientist wake up freezing
right now.

2089
01:38:25,651 --> 01:38:28,230
Global warming's not real.
He's 70 and he's,

2090
01:38:28,410 --> 01:38:31,230
he's trolling.
Yeah.

2091
01:38:31,231 --> 01:38:31,951
It's weird,
right?

2092
01:38:31,951 --> 01:38:33,840
It's true.
I wish the whole thing was a trawl.

2093
01:38:33,870 --> 01:38:36,060
That'd be so fucking know.
He's trolling about that though.

2094
01:38:36,310 --> 01:38:37,143
You know,
he just doesn't want anybody fucking 

2095
01:38:37,601 --> 01:38:39,850
with them and he feels like a lot of the
mainstream media,

2096
01:38:39,851 --> 01:38:42,820
they fuck with them.
And so he fires back and then it becomes

2097
01:38:42,821 --> 01:38:46,270
this weird thing where all the people 
that are on his side started like they,

2098
01:38:46,271 --> 01:38:47,410
you know,
they pick people,

2099
01:38:47,411 --> 01:38:49,990
pick sides man.
And they're like fake news food news.

2100
01:38:49,991 --> 01:38:52,210
Like,
no,

2101
01:38:52,211 --> 01:38:53,410
it's The New York Times.
It's not.

2102
01:38:53,500 --> 01:38:57,160
It's the one of the best news sources 
ever have.

2103
01:38:57,161 --> 01:38:57,851
They said,
shit,

2104
01:38:57,851 --> 01:39:01,210
that's not true.
100% you know why they're run by people.

2105
01:39:01,690 --> 01:39:02,523
People fuck up everywhere.
There's not a place where they go where 

2106
01:39:04,871 --> 01:39:07,960
they don't fuck up every fucking place a
person goes.

2107
01:39:08,200 --> 01:39:11,290
They fuck up.
They fuck up in Harvard,

2108
01:39:11,410 --> 01:39:12,243
they fuck up in mit.
They just fuck up way less than most of 

2109
01:39:16,301 --> 01:39:18,280
us.
There's still just people.

2110
01:39:19,390 --> 01:39:20,020
Okay.

2111
01:39:20,020 --> 01:39:20,853
Since W it's weird time right now.
So we're weird time right now as far as 

2112
01:39:24,471 --> 01:39:26,480
uh,
the way people are looking at things,

2113
01:39:27,980 --> 01:39:28,813
you know,

2114
01:39:30,650 --> 01:39:33,590
just seems everything's,
it seems very exaggerated.

2115
01:39:34,830 --> 01:39:39,830
A group preparing for something like 
we're screaming baby war North Korea,

2116
01:39:40,940 --> 01:39:42,890
North Korea.
But here's the other thing,

2117
01:39:42,920 --> 01:39:43,753
North Korea just made a speech recently 
where they were actually open to high 

2118
01:39:47,241 --> 01:39:49,120
level talks and there were,
there are,

2119
01:39:49,121 --> 01:39:49,954
there are more.
It was way more passive and less 

2120
01:39:51,531 --> 01:39:53,480
threatening.
Yeah.

2121
01:39:53,720 --> 01:39:54,553
And people like this crazy motherfucker 
might realize trump is a crazy 

2122
01:39:57,741 --> 01:39:58,574
motherfucker too,
who actually runs the u s and unlike 

2123
01:40:01,131 --> 01:40:05,780
Obama who would probably never consider 
a attacking North Korea,

2124
01:40:06,080 --> 01:40:07,460
he's looking at trump.
He's like,

2125
01:40:07,520 --> 01:40:10,220
this dude is 70.
Okay,

2126
01:40:10,400 --> 01:40:13,430
he's old as fuck.
He's been a gangster his whole life.

2127
01:40:13,460 --> 01:40:14,293
And now he just took over the country 
and he left the military guys do 

2128
01:40:16,881 --> 01:40:17,714
whatever the fuck they want to do.
You don't think there's a high 

2129
01:40:20,271 --> 01:40:24,500
possibility that some of those 
spaceships from Nevada might come out of

2130
01:40:24,501 --> 01:40:25,334
a hole in the ground and go rocketing 
towards North Korea in 20 minutes and 

2131
01:40:29,181 --> 01:40:32,390
let loose some crazy new bombs that you 
haven't even heard of yet.

2132
01:40:32,420 --> 01:40:34,040
That's entirely possible.
He knows it.

2133
01:40:35,240 --> 01:40:40,240
I don't like to think there's any 
benefit to our current situation.

2134
01:40:41,790 --> 01:40:42,623
Well,
we offer just cut off all their with a 

2135
01:40:43,921 --> 01:40:45,390
gas.
Yeah.

2136
01:40:45,450 --> 01:40:47,100
Yeah.
There's some serious sanctions,

2137
01:40:47,101 --> 01:40:50,260
so that might be why he's telling you 
guys.

2138
01:40:50,850 --> 01:40:52,650
Right.
That's actually probably more logical.

2139
01:40:52,710 --> 01:40:53,980
Yeah,
but I'm doing more of

2140
01:40:53,980 --> 01:40:54,813
the comic book thing.
It's like people don't want to piss 

2141
01:40:58,031 --> 01:40:59,230
trump off.
It's interesting,

2142
01:40:59,350 --> 01:41:01,100
you know?
Yeah,

2143
01:41:02,430 --> 01:41:04,360
it makes sense.
He's like,

2144
01:41:04,600 --> 01:41:06,520
he's definitely nuttier than the regular
dude.

2145
01:41:06,780 --> 01:41:09,010
He's definitely not nothing other than 
the regular dude that's in the job.

2146
01:41:09,560 --> 01:41:10,393
I thought we were getting an attack the 
other day when that space x launch 

2147
01:41:12,231 --> 01:41:13,220
happen,
like that was,

2148
01:41:14,350 --> 01:41:16,100
well,
everyone at starbucks,

2149
01:41:16,220 --> 01:41:17,053
I said starbucks,
everyone at starbucks started running 

2150
01:41:18,651 --> 01:41:19,550
out and I was like,
oh my God,

2151
01:41:19,551 --> 01:41:20,810
what's going on?
Like is there a bomb?

2152
01:41:20,811 --> 01:41:21,644
Like I was kind of freaked out.
Then everyone's like staring at the sky 

2153
01:41:23,541 --> 01:41:24,374
so I run out and first I thought it was 
an alien because I that pulsating smoke 

2154
01:41:30,470 --> 01:41:31,303
that was happening on the side,
like I'd never seen anything like that 

2155
01:41:34,011 --> 01:41:35,090
before.
It was like,

2156
01:41:35,360 --> 01:41:36,193
wait my eyes,
I've never seen that before because it 

2157
01:41:38,091 --> 01:41:39,650
was like,
it looked like a big whale.

2158
01:41:39,800 --> 01:41:42,410
Then there was like a.in
the middle of it that was pulsating,

2159
01:41:42,440 --> 01:41:45,670
like smoke rings almost and it just 
looked foreign.

2160
01:41:45,710 --> 01:41:47,480
It looked like an alien,
but then everyone's like,

2161
01:41:47,481 --> 01:41:48,530
is that Korea?
And I'm like,

2162
01:41:48,531 --> 01:41:52,760
I didn't even think about North Korea.
Like is that headed downtown?

2163
01:41:52,880 --> 01:41:53,720
I saw one of those ones

2164
01:41:53,830 --> 01:41:54,663
melrose,
it was a a launch at Edwards air force 

2165
01:41:56,321 --> 01:41:57,154
base.
They launched something like some 

2166
01:41:57,791 --> 01:41:59,350
missile test.
I was like,

2167
01:41:59,351 --> 01:42:00,184
Whoa,
you saw this thing shooting across the 

2168
01:42:01,241 --> 01:42:03,010
sky.
People are pulling their cars over.

2169
01:42:03,210 --> 01:42:06,670
This is a long time ago.
And they did it like right at dusk,

2170
01:42:06,790 --> 01:42:08,530
right as the sun was setting and they 
shot.

2171
01:42:08,531 --> 01:42:10,180
I think they thought they'd get away 
with it.

2172
01:42:10,181 --> 01:42:11,890
They could sneak it in there before we 
could see it.

2173
01:42:12,430 --> 01:42:14,510
It's,
it's weird that they do that.

2174
01:42:14,511 --> 01:42:15,344
Like there was a lot of car accidents 
when that happened because everyone 

2175
01:42:17,511 --> 01:42:18,380
thought,
what the fuck?

2176
01:42:18,381 --> 01:42:20,720
Where are we getting attack?
It's weird that they don't like,

2177
01:42:20,750 --> 01:42:24,380
you know how your phone goes off if 
Pablo gets kidnapped by his Stepdad,

2178
01:42:24,660 --> 01:42:26,860
you know you have that,
the android,

2179
01:42:27,720 --> 01:42:28,610
but they want to say,
hey,

2180
01:42:28,611 --> 01:42:31,370
there's going to be a big rocket launch.
Jamie,

2181
01:42:31,400 --> 01:42:33,630
what does this the one from last week?
Ah,

2182
01:42:33,680 --> 01:42:36,950
look at their dish.
That is crazy.

2183
01:42:37,600 --> 01:42:40,930
Oh my God.
Oh my God.

2184
01:42:40,931 --> 01:42:43,030
That is crazy.
And it's,

2185
01:42:43,050 --> 01:42:45,530
it's going around the earth and off 
into,

2186
01:42:45,550 --> 01:42:48,700
fuck,
it's shooting off three on Friday night.

2187
01:42:48,701 --> 01:42:50,190
So just,
here's your warning.

2188
01:42:50,540 --> 01:42:51,920
Don't forget fries.
Oh,

2189
01:42:51,940 --> 01:42:55,170
we're going to be sure.
When is the one where um,

2190
01:42:55,270 --> 01:42:57,870
he shoots a tesla to Mars.
When's he doing that?

2191
01:42:57,871 --> 01:43:00,880
It's coming up soon.
I think that's what the thing on Friday.

2192
01:43:00,910 --> 01:43:03,160
It was supposed to got pushed from 
Friday to Friday,

2193
01:43:03,161 --> 01:43:05,520
from Thursday and it's setting up the 
next,

2194
01:43:05,560 --> 01:43:07,150
the big launch,
which I think is that word.

2195
01:43:07,300 --> 01:43:09,220
Has there ever been a god?
It's more like Tony Stark.

2196
01:43:09,700 --> 01:43:11,500
Then you on musk.
Never.

2197
01:43:11,680 --> 01:43:12,513
He's awesome.
You think he's sending his car away so 

2198
01:43:14,531 --> 01:43:15,364
he can go get it?
Like he's going to be the first one out 

2199
01:43:18,251 --> 01:43:19,900
of here.
Take my car with me.

2200
01:43:19,901 --> 01:43:22,330
I won't let them go.
You got to stay.

2201
01:43:22,810 --> 01:43:23,890
Do we need you down here?

2202
01:43:23,920 --> 01:43:26,560
You might not make it back.
What if your calculations are off?

2203
01:43:26,740 --> 01:43:27,573
What if your calculations are off?
Like you know sometimes people were 

2204
01:43:29,681 --> 01:43:30,514
saying they get up the Tesla and the 
door handle doesn't open up 

2205
01:43:32,321 --> 01:43:35,020
automatically and then you don't even 
have a door handle like,

2206
01:43:35,021 --> 01:43:35,854
okay,
what if that happens when you're up 

2207
01:43:37,571 --> 01:43:38,900
there bro?
Yeah.

2208
01:43:39,100 --> 01:43:40,720
Huh?
Never.

2209
01:43:40,870 --> 01:43:44,920
We never had a super genius that 
everybody wants to just hand the keys to

2210
01:43:44,921 --> 01:43:46,900
before.
What if he is the Bitcoin guy too?

2211
01:43:46,901 --> 01:43:49,560
That some people think,
some people think he created bitcoin.

2212
01:43:49,570 --> 01:43:50,620
Yeah.
Shit.

2213
01:43:50,650 --> 01:43:53,630
I have to ask Mr Antonopoulos if he 
agrees with that.

2214
01:43:54,140 --> 01:43:56,000
I don't believe that.
That's why don't you?

2215
01:43:56,270 --> 01:43:57,103
Because that would be too crazy.
He could have been done a two crazy 

2216
01:43:58,860 --> 01:43:59,693
what?
He's an alien.

2217
01:44:00,200 --> 01:44:02,660
What if he's the future?
He's dating Johnny Depp's acts.

2218
01:44:02,661 --> 01:44:04,500
He can't be too close.
Broke up with her bro.

2219
01:44:05,160 --> 01:44:05,993
Go for him.
He brought it to the comic store one 

2220
01:44:07,551 --> 01:44:08,280
night.
Oh,

2221
01:44:08,280 --> 01:44:10,070
that's right dude.
I gotta think

2222
01:44:10,680 --> 01:44:11,513
that there's levels to everything and 
they might be even levels in the super 

2223
01:44:15,691 --> 01:44:18,600
genius category and he's in some weird 
new,

2224
01:44:18,601 --> 01:44:23,250
crazy ultra productive level of the 
super genius category.

2225
01:44:23,430 --> 01:44:25,860
Did he,
he powered what,

2226
01:44:25,900 --> 01:44:28,770
what part of New Zealand was at or 
something like that with that gigantic,

2227
01:44:28,771 --> 01:44:30,630
was it Australia?
It was Australia.

2228
01:44:30,780 --> 01:44:31,613
He made some sort of a bet where he 
would install some mega battery complex 

2229
01:44:37,290 --> 01:44:39,180
in Australia.
Am I remembering this right?

2230
01:44:39,990 --> 01:44:44,850
And uh,
it worked perfectly in record time.

2231
01:44:45,780 --> 01:44:46,613
See,
Tesla built a giant battery to fight 

2232
01:44:47,761 --> 01:44:48,594
power outages in Australia and it's 
already working and it worked in like 

2233
01:44:51,751 --> 01:44:52,584
milliseconds.
Like the power went down and it kicked 

2234
01:44:55,081 --> 01:45:00,081
on in milliseconds only last three years
before it starts at 0.14

2235
01:45:00,841 --> 01:45:03,360
seconds.
That's insane.

2236
01:45:04,050 --> 01:45:04,883
After a major plant,
the Loy Yang sang a station in the 

2237
01:45:08,701 --> 01:45:12,120
neighboring state of Victoria suffered a
sudden drop in output.

2238
01:45:12,210 --> 01:45:17,210
That's amazing.
It kicked in just 0.14

2239
01:45:17,371 --> 01:45:20,910
seconds after the thing went out.
The thing.

2240
01:45:21,190 --> 01:45:22,780
Nothing.
Yeah,

2241
01:45:22,830 --> 01:45:23,611
man.
He's a wizard.

2242
01:45:23,611 --> 01:45:27,240
He's,
he's some sort of new type of a cultural

2243
01:45:27,241 --> 01:45:31,260
figure like the,
the Electronic Daddy.

2244
01:45:31,950 --> 01:45:35,700
He's the guy's making cars.
He's going to build autonomous.

2245
01:45:36,390 --> 01:45:39,840
Uh,
what are those a transporter trucks.

2246
01:45:39,841 --> 01:45:42,750
Gigantic semi trucks.
The boring company.

2247
01:45:42,810 --> 01:45:44,040
Yeah,
the boring company.

2248
01:45:44,120 --> 01:45:46,820
He's going to fix traffic.
Why is it just keeps going?

2249
01:45:46,850 --> 01:45:48,920
Why is he a tackle?
Things like cancer.

2250
01:45:48,980 --> 01:45:53,120
Herpes figured out on your own bit.
Busy making electric cars.

2251
01:45:53,480 --> 01:45:55,180
The fuck.
What do you,

2252
01:45:55,280 --> 01:45:57,500
why don't you fix it?
I'm doing this.

2253
01:45:57,501 --> 01:45:58,880
I made a car.
I made a car.

2254
01:45:58,881 --> 01:46:01,810
I'm shooting one of my cars to the Mars.
You want to come when to watch?

2255
01:46:01,980 --> 01:46:02,813
I think he's got like,
he's got to have two or three friends 

2256
01:46:04,100 --> 01:46:06,950
that are sort of like,
what do you guys want to do this month?

2257
01:46:07,040 --> 01:46:11,480
What are we going to fix or fuck with?
Or He's too smart to have friends.

2258
01:46:12,560 --> 01:46:14,210
He's got a couple of people that he 
observes.

2259
01:46:15,050 --> 01:46:15,883
It's got to have a buddy.
He bounces some shit off of it as an 

2260
01:46:17,301 --> 01:46:20,000
alien.
You don't think the buddy would go,

2261
01:46:20,030 --> 01:46:23,600
just talk to Johnny Depp.
If you got a real buddy,

2262
01:46:24,770 --> 01:46:25,603
I'd be like,
listen,

2263
01:46:26,090 --> 01:46:26,923
seems amazing.
And who she's probably telling the 

2264
01:46:28,491 --> 01:46:30,200
truth.
I don't know.

2265
01:46:31,370 --> 01:46:33,110
I don't know who's right,
who's wrong.

2266
01:46:33,770 --> 01:46:34,603
Well,
I just,

2267
01:46:34,640 --> 01:46:35,840
I want you to be happy bro.

2268
01:46:36,720 --> 01:46:37,860
I don't want craziness.
And you like,

2269
01:46:39,330 --> 01:46:40,163
she just got off of doing coke and 
jumping out of windows and Harris 

2270
01:46:43,651 --> 01:46:45,690
freaking out.
What do I do?

2271
01:46:48,110 --> 01:46:48,943
Yeah,
I,

2272
01:46:49,290 --> 01:46:50,123
uh,

2273
01:46:50,550 --> 01:46:53,280
there's levels to the super genius game 
and he's some new level.

2274
01:46:53,310 --> 01:46:54,630
He's like some new,
uh,

2275
01:46:55,170 --> 01:46:56,820
Mike Tyson Punch out character.
Like,

2276
01:46:56,821 --> 01:46:57,654
Whoa,
like this is the new super genius 

2277
01:47:00,241 --> 01:47:04,650
inventor level,
but that's also a super famous person.

2278
01:47:05,250 --> 01:47:10,020
Like everybody knows who Elon Musk is.
He's almost like a character.

2279
01:47:10,290 --> 01:47:11,123
Like if you wanted proof that there's 
some sort of a really super complex but 

2280
01:47:16,260 --> 01:47:21,260
captivating narrative about being a 
person 2018 he's a central character.

2281
01:47:22,950 --> 01:47:24,180
Was He smart?
His whole life?

2282
01:47:24,181 --> 01:47:25,014
Like was,
he's creating things in like middle 

2283
01:47:26,131 --> 01:47:28,320
school and high score digital.
One day out of nowhere,

2284
01:47:28,321 --> 01:47:29,250
this guy comes back.
Oh,

2285
01:47:29,251 --> 01:47:30,390
I invented it itself.
Stuff.

2286
01:47:30,400 --> 01:47:31,233
Yeah,
I'm smart.

2287
01:47:31,360 --> 01:47:33,420
That's a good question.
Maybe it is all off rouge.

2288
01:47:33,450 --> 01:47:36,180
It's a good question.
It's really just foxconn.

2289
01:47:36,210 --> 01:47:37,260
What if he's the first robot?

2290
01:47:37,650 --> 01:47:42,600
What if they sent him to like we,
we get him a run for president.

2291
01:47:42,840 --> 01:47:44,730
He went and then,
uh,

2292
01:47:44,731 --> 01:47:47,760
on TV cuts open his arm and he shows you
circuitry.

2293
01:47:47,910 --> 01:47:49,320
It's like,
robots need love too.

2294
01:47:50,250 --> 01:47:52,350
I helped you guys a fixture,
whole fucking world.

2295
01:47:53,910 --> 01:47:54,560
That's the way

2296
01:47:54,560 --> 01:47:56,610
he made a computer game when he was 12.
Dao,

2297
01:47:57,560 --> 01:48:02,560
te normal doom,
doom,

2298
01:48:03,051 --> 01:48:04,280
vr.
Have you played that?

2299
01:48:04,290 --> 01:48:05,123
Yeah.
It's very disturbing to know those 

2300
01:48:06,231 --> 01:48:07,550
people that have that much smarter than 
you.

2301
01:48:07,880 --> 01:48:08,481
Right?
And you go,

2302
01:48:08,481 --> 01:48:09,314
well,
right?

2303
01:48:09,560 --> 01:48:10,341
Being,
here's the thing,

2304
01:48:10,341 --> 01:48:11,174
like

2305
01:48:11,250 --> 01:48:13,950
people are better than you at shit.
You got to get over that.

2306
01:48:14,700 --> 01:48:16,470
There's just no way around it.
You know?

2307
01:48:16,471 --> 01:48:21,471
Imagine if you like Elon Musk's older 
brother and you,

2308
01:48:21,511 --> 01:48:22,860
you know,
you're like,

2309
01:48:22,861 --> 01:48:23,850
Bro,
you don't know shit.

2310
01:48:23,940 --> 01:48:26,040
You're only seven.
And he's like,

2311
01:48:26,041 --> 01:48:30,060
okay.
It just brews up inside of them.

2312
01:48:31,320 --> 01:48:33,600
Grows,
grows in power.

2313
01:48:34,680 --> 01:48:37,470
Then what do you do?
Even if you're happy,

2314
01:48:37,650 --> 01:48:40,110
even when you have a great life,
like even if you're like,

2315
01:48:40,350 --> 01:48:41,160
you know,
what do I do?

2316
01:48:41,160 --> 01:48:42,660
Oh,
um,

2317
01:48:42,720 --> 01:48:45,690
I make log furniture,
you know,

2318
01:48:45,691 --> 01:48:46,524
like for outside for the patio.
I mean some of the people's fondest 

2319
01:48:48,781 --> 01:48:53,730
moments you're sitting on the back patio
and um,

2320
01:48:53,790 --> 01:48:56,760
I just,
it seems kind of old fashioned to me and

2321
01:48:56,761 --> 01:48:58,500
one of the old fashioned things that I 
like,

2322
01:48:58,501 --> 01:49:03,330
his log furniture,
so I build log outside patio furniture.

2323
01:49:03,630 --> 01:49:05,010
My Name's Michael.
Michael Mosque.

2324
01:49:05,880 --> 01:49:07,380
Yeah.
I'm super happy.

2325
01:49:07,440 --> 01:49:09,240
Couldn't be happier.
Yeah.

2326
01:49:09,540 --> 01:49:10,410
Yeah.
He's my brother.

2327
01:49:10,570 --> 01:49:12,150
Ha Ha.
Yeah.

2328
01:49:12,151 --> 01:49:13,530
You line,
he's a,

2329
01:49:13,860 --> 01:49:15,360
let me tell you something.
Elan's on speed.

2330
01:49:15,450 --> 01:49:16,283
Okay.
He lands on adderall and provigil and 

2331
01:49:20,011 --> 01:49:20,844
nuvigil and he's taking micro doses.
He microdosing he's not clean test him 

2332
01:49:26,430 --> 01:49:27,030
shit.

2333
01:49:27,030 --> 01:49:32,030
He's got a brother Kimbal Musk,
elon musk.

2334
01:49:33,271 --> 01:49:35,820
He's a super genius that exists in the 
Lotus position.

2335
01:49:35,970 --> 01:49:39,570
Floats in midair and some wheat silo 
somewhere in New Hampshire.

2336
01:49:39,571 --> 01:49:41,370
And they go visit them a couple of times
a month.

2337
01:49:42,480 --> 01:49:43,620
I wouldn't mind,
I would be like,

2338
01:49:43,621 --> 01:49:45,480
give me a free test every couple of 
days.

2339
01:49:45,870 --> 01:49:48,700
They probably got that dude in the 
bunker with Dick Cheney right now.

2340
01:49:49,300 --> 01:49:51,330
Kimbal musk.
Yeah.

2341
01:49:51,340 --> 01:49:54,310
I want to know what Kimble does.
He teaches Kung Fu.

2342
01:49:54,460 --> 01:49:56,770
He's in those videos that are always 
posted on instagram.

2343
01:49:56,900 --> 01:49:59,710
He's just imagine if his brother was 
just a nut.

2344
01:50:00,520 --> 01:50:03,070
Oh look at him.
Handsome bastard shrinking coffee.

2345
01:50:03,130 --> 01:50:03,963
Oh my age.
45 regional manager for blockbuster 

2346
01:50:06,971 --> 01:50:07,351
video.
Oh,

2347
01:50:07,351 --> 01:50:09,580
he's from South Africa.
Even crazier.

2348
01:50:09,760 --> 01:50:10,593
So Ellen's from South Africa to wow.
If they could have started at a company 

2349
01:50:15,431 --> 01:50:19,230
called Zip two and sold it to compaq and
that's where he started.

2350
01:50:19,231 --> 01:50:21,850
South Africa is a interesting place.

2351
01:50:22,690 --> 01:50:24,490
Very,
very interesting place.

2352
01:50:24,820 --> 01:50:26,800
A lot of people I know that go there,
love it.

2353
01:50:27,700 --> 01:50:28,533
And I'm obviously the crazy history with
Nelson Mandela and apartheid and how 

2354
01:50:33,280 --> 01:50:37,550
recent that was to us.
But I always think of a,

2355
01:50:37,610 --> 01:50:41,350
that sugar man movie.
When I think of South Africa now,

2356
01:50:42,130 --> 01:50:42,963
I always think of district nine.
Doesn't it look like district nine 

2357
01:50:44,471 --> 01:50:46,480
there?
Um,

2358
01:50:46,510 --> 01:50:49,510
the movie with the robots standard or 
no?

2359
01:50:49,560 --> 01:50:50,393
No,
district nine was the movie with the 

2360
01:50:51,491 --> 01:50:53,740
aliens are aliens.
No,

2361
01:50:53,770 --> 01:50:54,850
they weren't robots.
Right.

2362
01:50:54,880 --> 01:50:57,340
They were like weird aliens.
What were they?

2363
01:50:57,940 --> 01:51:00,400
I think some,
that sort of thing of both.

2364
01:51:00,401 --> 01:51:02,110
Honestly.
It was like some sort of tech alien.

2365
01:51:02,140 --> 01:51:02,973
Oh,
that's right.

2366
01:51:03,670 --> 01:51:05,920
Can you show it again?
That was a great fucking movie.

2367
01:51:05,921 --> 01:51:07,750
I love that.
Maybe it's one of my favorites.

2368
01:51:08,890 --> 01:51:09,910
Oh,
that's right.

2369
01:51:09,911 --> 01:51:10,744
Yeah.
They were like some sort of Matt 

2370
01:51:11,980 --> 01:51:13,150
goodness.
Yeah,

2371
01:51:13,151 --> 01:51:14,920
that's right,
man.

2372
01:51:15,220 --> 01:51:16,570
Fuck.
That was a good move.

2373
01:51:16,571 --> 01:51:19,690
A to rewatch it.
I think it was shot in South Africa.

2374
01:51:19,691 --> 01:51:21,280
I think that's where he's from.
They've got it made it neill.

2375
01:51:21,281 --> 01:51:22,420
Blomkamp.
Yeah.

2376
01:51:23,500 --> 01:51:24,333
Um,
what was the movie I said that it made 

2377
01:51:25,621 --> 01:51:27,380
me remind me of,
uh,

2378
01:51:29,470 --> 01:51:31,150
what did I just say?
Didn't eat.

2379
01:51:31,310 --> 01:51:33,000
I heard it,
but it's not registered.

2380
01:51:33,020 --> 01:51:34,180
I don't,
God dammit.

2381
01:51:35,830 --> 01:51:36,610
Yeah.

2382
01:51:36,610 --> 01:51:39,370
Aye d aunt word is always a big 
connection.

2383
01:51:39,660 --> 01:51:44,290
I always think about them,
but I was saying it was Nelson Mandela.

2384
01:51:44,291 --> 01:51:47,590
There was something else that made me 
think about South Africa.

2385
01:51:47,770 --> 01:51:49,390
I'll come back to it.
Oh,

2386
01:51:49,391 --> 01:51:51,460
that Alysia movie.
That was the Matt Damon Movie.

2387
01:51:51,910 --> 01:51:54,390
Was that in South Africa?
Yes.

2388
01:51:55,960 --> 01:51:58,870
I think it's sort of similar topic as 
district nine.

2389
01:51:59,070 --> 01:51:59,903
Yeah.
Day Man.

2390
01:52:00,490 --> 01:52:01,323
It's crazy that a guy like elon musk's,
something super duper fucking genius 

2391
01:52:06,881 --> 01:52:08,080
would come out of that spot.

2392
01:52:10,600 --> 01:52:15,600
And what's that plays like let's do a 
jre in South Africa to alive.

2393
01:52:15,651 --> 01:52:19,610
Jre cause one with the great whites.
Fuck that.

2394
01:52:19,611 --> 01:52:20,361
That's true.
Right?

2395
01:52:20,361 --> 01:52:21,770
That's a scary spot.
Like I'm here.

2396
01:52:21,771 --> 01:52:22,604
When you fly over me and you're playing,
they jump up and try to bite the plane 

2397
01:52:28,920 --> 01:52:29,753
that's bought man.
You want to talk about spots South 

2398
01:52:33,710 --> 01:52:38,710
Africa like Dutch colonists trying to 
like carve out a place in the,

2399
01:52:39,501 --> 01:52:42,440
in the,
in the land in Africa.

2400
01:52:43,810 --> 01:52:46,310
What do you got me here?
The boys in South Africa.

2401
01:52:46,340 --> 01:52:49,640
Oh No.
Gotten a zebra suit and went out and but

2402
01:52:49,641 --> 01:52:50,520
lions fuck with them.

2403
01:52:52,700 --> 01:52:56,110
We had Steve O on the kill Tony last 
night for the weigh ins.

2404
01:52:56,980 --> 01:52:59,240
Is this an a game preserve though as I 
remember them?

2405
01:52:59,241 --> 01:53:02,150
Hey actually telling a story on here.
I think that the shot the line part here

2406
01:53:02,270 --> 01:53:03,103
and La,
the reason why I ask is there's plays 

2407
01:53:04,830 --> 01:53:07,820
they have placed in South Africa where 
they let the lions loose or not.

2408
01:53:07,940 --> 01:53:09,620
Like they,
they know when to let them loose.

2409
01:53:10,100 --> 01:53:11,720
Like it's kind of a,
Oh,

2410
01:53:11,721 --> 01:53:14,560
Jesus Christ.
The lions actually tried to get him.

2411
01:53:14,590 --> 01:53:16,130
Yeah.
Oh No.

2412
01:53:17,930 --> 01:53:20,660
Oh my God.
That's insane.

2413
01:53:21,830 --> 01:53:24,470
The lions took away their hat.
The Zebra head,

2414
01:53:25,220 --> 01:53:26,960
dude,
that is so crazy.

2415
01:53:26,990 --> 01:53:31,040
They're lucky they lived,
they did the dumbest stuff on that show.

2416
01:53:31,250 --> 01:53:32,300
Yeah.
That really was,

2417
01:53:32,780 --> 01:53:33,613
he's had more than one experiences with 
lines then because I thought the one 

2418
01:53:35,541 --> 01:53:37,700
that he had in the tree was the only one
he ever had.

2419
01:53:37,970 --> 01:53:39,520
Does that Steevo right there,
that Brit,

2420
01:53:40,190 --> 01:53:45,190
he's crazy.
I had drinks with him.

2421
01:53:46,280 --> 01:53:50,420
Everlast Eddie Bravo want to 80 students
and uh,

2422
01:53:50,480 --> 01:53:53,270
steve o's girlfriend were all hanging 
around and um,

2423
01:53:54,230 --> 01:53:56,870
steve was telling me like all these 
different things that he's about to do.

2424
01:53:57,800 --> 01:53:59,150
And I was like,
why?

2425
01:53:59,330 --> 01:54:00,410
I'm like,
why are you doing that?

2426
01:54:00,411 --> 01:54:05,411
He's showing me the scars that he had on
his arm from the operations where he had

2427
01:54:05,511 --> 01:54:06,230
to,
uh,

2428
01:54:06,230 --> 01:54:08,160
what's going on here?
She's got a book,

2429
01:54:08,640 --> 01:54:13,520
he's Bait for shark.
He put a hook to his lip and then jumped

2430
01:54:13,521 --> 01:54:16,970
out in the water with sharks that,
oh my God,

2431
01:54:17,150 --> 01:54:20,750
no cage just jumped in the water with a 
hook in his mouth.

2432
01:54:21,830 --> 01:54:24,380
His latest one where he got burnt his 
back and everything.

2433
01:54:25,550 --> 01:54:26,690
Yeah,
that's what I'm talking about.

2434
01:54:26,691 --> 01:54:27,470
He,
um,

2435
01:54:27,470 --> 01:54:29,440
he had a bunch of different,
uh,

2436
01:54:29,600 --> 01:54:31,580
skin graphs from cadavers.

2437
01:54:32,450 --> 01:54:36,380
That's so crazy that he looks good now 
though.

2438
01:54:36,860 --> 01:54:38,300
So I'm last night.
He does.

2439
01:54:38,570 --> 01:54:39,291
He's shown him,
put him,

2440
01:54:39,291 --> 01:54:42,800
he's planning on more chaos.
He's not like you always going to go.

2441
01:54:42,801 --> 01:54:43,850
You're done.
You're fine.

2442
01:54:43,910 --> 01:54:45,290
You could walk.
Everything's fine.

2443
01:54:45,320 --> 01:54:46,940
Let's just end this.
Nope.

2444
01:54:47,070 --> 01:54:49,550
It's like evil knievel.
That guy never stopped.

2445
01:54:49,551 --> 01:54:51,890
Right.
I think he's way less busted up and evil

2446
01:54:51,891 --> 01:54:54,470
knievel evil knievel lived in the days 
where,

2447
01:54:54,590 --> 01:54:55,820
you know,
they,

2448
01:54:55,880 --> 01:54:56,713
the medicine was not as good,
but he also was flying motorcycles and 

2449
01:54:59,991 --> 01:55:00,611
shit.
Wait,

2450
01:55:00,611 --> 01:55:01,444
different weight,
evil knievel was jumping rockets across 

2451
01:55:04,611 --> 01:55:05,810
canyons.
Remember that?

2452
01:55:06,500 --> 01:55:08,600
Snake River Canyon,
is that what it was?

2453
01:55:09,800 --> 01:55:11,540
Where was that?
In Arizona or some shit.

2454
01:55:12,420 --> 01:55:14,530
What do you remember that he had a 
rocket.

2455
01:55:14,540 --> 01:55:15,770
He shot across a canyon.

2456
01:55:16,910 --> 01:55:17,743
Yeah.

2457
01:55:17,800 --> 01:55:18,520
Those,
uh,

2458
01:55:18,520 --> 01:55:22,210
those guys that climb those uh,
skyscrapers and stuff.

2459
01:55:22,240 --> 01:55:23,073
Did you see the guy that fell that was 
this creepy video to watch horrifying 

2460
01:55:27,731 --> 01:55:29,000
video to watch?
Scary.

2461
01:55:29,230 --> 01:55:31,480
Horrifying.
Yeah.

2462
01:55:31,481 --> 01:55:33,490
That,
that's um,

2463
01:55:35,410 --> 01:55:39,130
encouraging that is not wise,
but discouraging it.

2464
01:55:44,080 --> 01:55:46,090
I've seen a lot of those videos.
Right.

2465
01:55:46,150 --> 01:55:48,250
I've watched a lot of them.
I had a,

2466
01:55:49,330 --> 01:55:50,560
what is his name?
Okay.

2467
01:55:50,690 --> 01:55:52,550
Could we have in the show super strong 
fingers.

2468
01:55:52,720 --> 01:55:54,760
James Kingston,
King James Kingston,

2469
01:55:54,761 --> 01:55:55,594
who was a very nice guy who has done a 
lot of things online that it freaked me 

2470
01:55:58,301 --> 01:56:01,490
the fuck out and he was really nice guy.
I don't want to tell that guy.

2471
01:56:01,491 --> 01:56:05,110
He can't do something that I enjoyed 
watching that he succeeded in doing.

2472
01:56:06,010 --> 01:56:08,470
I don't,
I don't want them to land on me either.

2473
01:56:09,220 --> 01:56:10,090
You know,
it's like,

2474
01:56:10,540 --> 01:56:11,373
I mean,
how much time and effort have you done 

2475
01:56:13,120 --> 01:56:13,953
in to cleaning up the bottom area where 
you might fall because you're going to 

2476
01:56:16,721 --> 01:56:18,370
fall if you fall out.
Okay.

2477
01:56:18,371 --> 01:56:19,204
I'm not saying you're going to fall,
but if you fall you might fall on 

2478
01:56:20,801 --> 01:56:21,880
somebody.
Okay,

2479
01:56:21,881 --> 01:56:25,270
this is different.
Fuck this.

2480
01:56:25,570 --> 01:56:27,580
This is not good

2481
01:56:27,630 --> 01:56:30,160
for me.
I can't even know why I came in.

2482
01:56:30,170 --> 01:56:33,910
A Lot's changed.
Don't put this off.

2483
01:56:35,770 --> 01:56:38,080
Oh gotta get down.
We've got to get down from here.

2484
01:56:38,110 --> 01:56:39,120
We gotta get that back.
Got To get done

2485
01:56:39,790 --> 01:56:41,430
del slow and they'll stop.
Don't do work at the top.

2486
01:56:42,100 --> 01:56:43,420
We got away with it.
We got away with it.

2487
01:56:45,530 --> 01:56:48,290
Just thinking it's not in the interest 
of full disclosure.

2488
01:56:48,291 --> 01:56:51,470
We got way too high before the show who 
legal weed.

2489
01:56:51,471 --> 01:56:53,000
That's why you know what it is.
Um,

2490
01:56:53,060 --> 01:56:54,290
also that,
um,

2491
01:56:55,450 --> 01:56:57,190
that fucking,
um,

2492
01:56:59,660 --> 01:57:03,320
the weed that we used to have before

2493
01:57:04,120 --> 01:57:08,110
sober October and the weed after sober 
October is different,

2494
01:57:08,470 --> 01:57:13,110
different stuff.
And I think the combination of those two

2495
01:57:13,111 --> 01:57:13,944
things,
a combination of taking a month off and 

2496
01:57:15,871 --> 01:57:19,650
then trying some new different stuff.
There's different stuff.

2497
01:57:19,950 --> 01:57:20,520
It's different.

2498
01:57:20,520 --> 01:57:22,170
Yeah.
But your tolerance also restarted.

2499
01:57:22,650 --> 01:57:23,700
Yeah.
It's not good right now.

2500
01:57:24,320 --> 01:57:26,310
Sketchy.
You gotta be careful.

2501
01:57:26,311 --> 01:57:27,144
I've got to gingerly,
gingerly walked into the waters one 

2502
01:57:29,011 --> 01:57:29,970
month.
Cleanses you.

2503
01:57:30,480 --> 01:57:31,610
Oh yeah.
It cleanses you.

2504
01:57:31,630 --> 01:57:34,530
It's amazing how fast it cleanses.
Like three days.

2505
01:57:34,800 --> 01:57:36,600
If I haven't smoked in three days and I 
spoke a joint,

2506
01:57:36,601 --> 01:57:37,434
I'm like so stoned out of my gourd.
I still can't remember what I wanted to 

2507
01:57:42,361 --> 01:57:43,194
say about South Africa.
I knew it had something to do with a 

2508
01:57:46,440 --> 01:57:49,590
apartheid and the struggle in that area 
and how strange it is.

2509
01:57:51,150 --> 01:57:53,340
African itself.
What's that?

2510
01:57:53,610 --> 01:57:54,900
Chappy chappy.
Oh,

2511
01:57:54,901 --> 01:57:56,490
there was another movie and has a decent
word one.

2512
01:57:56,520 --> 01:57:58,290
Yeah,
yeah,

2513
01:57:58,291 --> 01:57:59,640
that's right.
That's right.

2514
01:58:00,000 --> 01:58:03,240
That wasn't as good.
Deanna word came out strong.

2515
01:58:03,930 --> 01:58:07,920
They're interesting that Yolanda,
Yolanda,

2516
01:58:07,950 --> 01:58:09,210
Yolanda,
Yolanda,

2517
01:58:09,690 --> 01:58:11,910
Yolanda foster.
How do you say her name?

2518
01:58:14,050 --> 01:58:14,770
Oh,
lanny.

2519
01:58:14,770 --> 01:58:17,080
How'd he say it?
I think it's your lanny.

2520
01:58:17,530 --> 01:58:19,510
Yolanda.
Yolanda.

2521
01:58:19,720 --> 01:58:20,740
Yolanda.
Yolanda.

2522
01:58:20,770 --> 01:58:21,790
Yolanda.
Visser.

2523
01:58:21,850 --> 01:58:25,420
That's it.
Yolandi visser reminds me of like,

2524
01:58:25,450 --> 01:58:30,450
Bingo.
Yeah.

2525
01:58:30,640 --> 01:58:32,190
What movie was that?
Chappy?

2526
01:58:32,650 --> 01:58:34,540
Hmm.
Do you know that day?

2527
01:58:34,550 --> 01:58:37,150
Uh,
they were like,

2528
01:58:37,151 --> 01:58:37,984
you know,
they're like the main characters in the 

2529
01:58:38,621 --> 01:58:40,990
movie,
but they said something or they to the,

2530
01:58:41,500 --> 01:58:45,090
about the director or the studio.
They did,

2531
01:58:45,130 --> 01:58:45,963
they got in a fight.
So they took them off the poster and 

2532
01:58:47,231 --> 01:58:48,064
everything.
That's why they're not on any of the 

2533
01:58:49,481 --> 01:58:50,314
posters,
even though they're like main 

2534
01:58:50,861 --> 01:58:52,600
characters.
Fortunate.

2535
01:58:52,630 --> 01:58:53,740
Yeah.
That sucks.

2536
01:58:54,880 --> 01:58:56,230
See,
that's why people like Deanwood,

2537
01:58:56,290 --> 01:58:58,010
they're little too raw.
They need like a,

2538
01:58:58,011 --> 01:59:00,530
um,
a slick talking manager and we're doing,

2539
01:59:00,540 --> 01:59:02,230
we're,
we're dealing with artists here.

2540
01:59:02,231 --> 01:59:04,120
Ultimately they don't really mean what 
they say.

2541
01:59:04,390 --> 01:59:06,790
It's just the same explosive nature that
lives inside.

2542
01:59:06,791 --> 01:59:10,210
Then let some create such amazing music 
that you're a fan of and I'm a fan off.

2543
01:59:10,720 --> 01:59:11,553
Sometimes it gets haywire and he would 
just like to come in and apologize for 

2544
01:59:14,801 --> 01:59:15,634
bitch slapping you,
telling you to suck his dick was all 

2545
01:59:20,651 --> 01:59:21,920
wrong.
Yeah.

2546
01:59:21,921 --> 01:59:23,440
They,
I mean they didn't even market it.

2547
01:59:23,441 --> 01:59:25,720
That dmt word was in it.
That's crazy.

2548
01:59:26,110 --> 01:59:27,310
Yeah,
that seems like a mistake.

2549
01:59:27,760 --> 01:59:30,580
It seems like you don't like money,
but who knows?

2550
01:59:30,820 --> 01:59:32,230
Who knows what they're really like,
you know,

2551
01:59:32,231 --> 01:59:33,370
that would be the big bummer.
Right?

2552
01:59:33,400 --> 01:59:36,430
You meet him in their dicks mean and 
hung out with them.

2553
01:59:36,480 --> 01:59:39,970
It really smelled like armpits.
Who's armpits though?

2554
01:59:40,400 --> 01:59:41,233
Some people's armpits smell lovely.
It's like that one year you took 

2555
01:59:44,090 --> 01:59:45,850
deodorant.
It wasn't a whole year.

2556
01:59:46,700 --> 01:59:49,990
It's like a week to seem like it here.
Cause like Ari's DMT trip.

2557
01:59:52,600 --> 01:59:56,080
I remember what the e three and you're 
just making waves of smell.

2558
01:59:56,800 --> 01:59:59,340
You can't do that.
You just can't not wear deodorant.

2559
01:59:59,410 --> 02:00:02,500
I tried for a little while.
It's weird.

2560
02:00:03,430 --> 02:00:04,263
Isn't it interesting too that we've all 
just accepted that we have to put 

2561
02:00:07,601 --> 02:00:08,434
chemicals on certain parts of our body 
in order not to smell after you've been 

2562
02:00:12,461 --> 02:00:15,130
moving around for too long.
It's weird man.

2563
02:00:16,210 --> 02:00:19,930
Like have you ever shave your armpits 
once by mistake?

2564
02:00:20,380 --> 02:00:21,213
Bad idea.
I wonder how much of a effect it must 

2565
02:00:23,231 --> 02:00:25,870
have some effect on what your armpits 
smell like.

2566
02:00:26,320 --> 02:00:27,370
How's too?
Yeah.

2567
02:00:27,610 --> 02:00:28,630
Yeah,
for sure.

2568
02:00:30,790 --> 02:00:35,740
But you can't do it unless you're,
unless you're a bodybuilder.

2569
02:00:35,890 --> 02:00:38,170
Like there's things you could do.
Like if my chest itches,

2570
02:00:38,171 --> 02:00:39,004
I'll shave my chest and I'm,
I'm embarrassed to say it but I'll do 

2571
02:00:41,561 --> 02:00:42,394
it.
Especially if it gets itchy after a 

2572
02:00:43,471 --> 02:00:45,130
while.
I don't fuck with my armpits bro.

2573
02:00:46,420 --> 02:00:48,040
That's vain.
Guys.

2574
02:00:48,130 --> 02:00:48,963
Shaved their arms that don't have like 
something like carrot top or someone 

2575
02:00:52,271 --> 02:00:54,130
saying he shaves his arms.
Yes.

2576
02:00:54,131 --> 02:00:55,780
Does it cause he likes the hate the 
field.

2577
02:00:55,930 --> 02:00:56,763
Well,
carrot top used to be a super 

2578
02:00:57,581 --> 02:00:59,830
bodybuilder Jack Guy.
I remember him.

2579
02:00:59,920 --> 02:01:02,230
I think he said he'd just,
he did at one time when he was a swimmer

2580
02:01:02,231 --> 02:01:03,910
and he just liked to feelings.
It's just like fuck,

2581
02:01:04,510 --> 02:01:08,760
slippery,
slippery through that pool slipping.

2582
02:01:08,800 --> 02:01:11,680
Sliding.
I oil up,

2583
02:01:12,280 --> 02:01:16,540
oil up for I swim.
So he's not buff anymore.

2584
02:01:16,550 --> 02:01:18,760
He's back to normal.
Well he's still buff.

2585
02:01:19,060 --> 02:01:22,630
He's just not a giant bodybuilder guy.
Creepy buff.

2586
02:01:22,780 --> 02:01:23,613
He,
I don't want to talk for him cause I 

2587
02:01:25,871 --> 02:01:28,960
don't know him but I know Dunkin did 
something with him a long time ago.

2588
02:01:28,961 --> 02:01:31,210
They did a pilot for some sort of a 
reality show.

2589
02:01:31,410 --> 02:01:34,930
That's right.
Um,

2590
02:01:35,620 --> 02:01:36,670
yeah,
that's the carrot top.

2591
02:01:36,671 --> 02:01:37,504
It is Jackie.
Jackie just and that's like a normal 

2592
02:01:39,210 --> 02:01:40,040
karyotype.
Yeah,

2593
02:01:40,040 --> 02:01:41,060
that's,
I think it's more,

2594
02:01:41,061 --> 02:01:44,570
he's like,
now he's like more like looks fit.

2595
02:01:44,750 --> 02:01:45,950
Okay.
That Kathy Green.

2596
02:01:45,951 --> 02:01:46,784
Yeah.
But like back then he looked like super 

2597
02:01:49,370 --> 02:01:50,203
duper jacked.
Like his shoulders were popping out 

2598
02:01:52,790 --> 02:01:55,640
unnaturally wide.
Like it didn't even make sense.

2599
02:01:55,641 --> 02:01:58,400
Like right there.
Yeah,

2600
02:01:58,700 --> 02:02:01,440
he went off the deep end.
It looked like he had me mean.

2601
02:02:01,441 --> 02:02:03,530
He's so big.
Who knows what the fuck he was doing,

2602
02:02:03,590 --> 02:02:06,800
what he was doing.
A lot of shit that's shorter.

2603
02:02:06,801 --> 02:02:07,290
It's not,
look,

2604
02:02:07,290 --> 02:02:08,690
it looks like an implants.
Yeah.

2605
02:02:08,990 --> 02:02:10,140
It could be,
um,

2606
02:02:10,490 --> 02:02:14,420
something called synthol that um,
some bodybuilders,

2607
02:02:14,450 --> 02:02:15,860
uh,
engage in and what it does,

2608
02:02:15,861 --> 02:02:16,694
they think it helps them balance out 
areas of their body that aren't big 

2609
02:02:20,031 --> 02:02:20,864
enough.
And it's real weird cause there's a ton 

2610
02:02:24,831 --> 02:02:26,270
of videos of people taking,
you know,

2611
02:02:26,271 --> 02:02:30,170
the videos he's putting synthol in their
muscles and dancing around.

2612
02:02:30,830 --> 02:02:33,140
That's not that,
that's just him looking buff.

2613
02:02:33,410 --> 02:02:36,200
That doesn't look anything nearly as 
bad.

2614
02:02:36,260 --> 02:02:40,000
We're looking at a carrot top where he 
can see his dick route.

2615
02:02:40,850 --> 02:02:42,870
It goes to the photo,
goes all the way down as well.

2616
02:02:42,930 --> 02:02:43,763
I call what I call it.
So it's my name and Amy Cook always 

2617
02:02:46,341 --> 02:02:50,180
posting guys.
Exactly what I,

2618
02:02:50,181 --> 02:02:53,210
um,
describe that look to people where a man

2619
02:02:53,300 --> 02:02:57,110
has his underwear at the very base of 
his cock.

2620
02:02:57,111 --> 02:02:59,330
That's your Dick Route.
That's a beautiful term.

2621
02:02:59,480 --> 02:03:01,510
Yeah.
Thank you.

2622
02:03:02,150 --> 02:03:02,990
I,
by the way,

2623
02:03:02,991 --> 02:03:05,810
I demand 100% credit for Dick rude 
tickers.

2624
02:03:05,840 --> 02:03:06,673
I created it.
So I was trying to figure out how to 

2625
02:03:08,931 --> 02:03:11,870
describe what was uncomfortable about 
those kinds of pictures.

2626
02:03:11,890 --> 02:03:15,530
And it's like you're trying so hard and 
like that's Dick Route.

2627
02:03:15,560 --> 02:03:17,520
That's Dick route all the way.
Carrot top.

2628
02:03:17,770 --> 02:03:20,330
Take any dignity Dick.
It looks like case a thong on.

2629
02:03:20,331 --> 02:03:24,590
It doesn't even look like it shouldn't 
be possible with the laws of gravity.

2630
02:03:25,010 --> 02:03:27,530
It looks like that things should fall 
down your ankles.

2631
02:03:28,940 --> 02:03:29,773
Freckled boners she'd come rocketing at 
the screen like a three d shark in jaws 

2632
02:03:34,161 --> 02:03:39,161
three d three but he's,
he's just jacked.

2633
02:03:39,621 --> 02:03:41,330
I mean,
he's just a guy who wants everybody suck

2634
02:03:41,331 --> 02:03:42,164
his deck.
Just like letting you know it's right 

2635
02:03:43,551 --> 02:03:45,230
there.
Right there.

2636
02:03:46,400 --> 02:03:48,320
That makes sense.
But I mean,

2637
02:03:48,321 --> 02:03:49,640
but he's just jack,
that makes sense.

2638
02:03:49,641 --> 02:03:53,270
But what does it make sense as the s the
people would stick the oil in their arms

2639
02:03:53,271 --> 02:03:54,104
and they would create like water 
balloons where their muscles should be 

2640
02:03:57,290 --> 02:04:01,190
and they would dance around and there's 
one video of a guy like throwing punches

2641
02:04:01,191 --> 02:04:03,440
in the air with these water balloons for
arms.

2642
02:04:03,800 --> 02:04:05,990
It's so weird.
It's just,

2643
02:04:06,020 --> 02:04:11,000
it's so strange.
Dick root.

2644
02:04:11,330 --> 02:04:15,350
Remember that does a bunch of people 
that have those pictures.

2645
02:04:15,351 --> 02:04:17,280
It was Dick route pictures.
Didn't cook.

2646
02:04:17,281 --> 02:04:18,810
Put like loves the Dick.
Rick,

2647
02:04:19,480 --> 02:04:20,313
he's a handsome fellow.
I suppose she has a good works hard in 

2648
02:04:22,941 --> 02:04:24,830
the gym.
I have to show the goods.

2649
02:04:24,860 --> 02:04:26,450
Oh No,
this guy,

2650
02:04:26,720 --> 02:04:28,960
this guy,
100% is using that stuff for,

2651
02:04:28,961 --> 02:04:29,794
he's got two equally sized tumors cause 
he think that looks good while he's 

2652
02:04:34,191 --> 02:04:37,900
probably mentally deficient and it's 
probably something wrong with them.

2653
02:04:37,901 --> 02:04:38,130
Like

2654
02:04:38,130 --> 02:04:39,090
God now.
Yeah.

2655
02:04:39,330 --> 02:04:40,163
Now if he was like balancing on top of a
skyscraper at the same time would be 

2656
02:04:42,961 --> 02:04:46,350
even worse.
See the thing about this young man is,

2657
02:04:46,351 --> 02:04:48,150
you know,
it was probably something severely wrong

2658
02:04:48,151 --> 02:04:48,984
with him,
but what he is is an abuser look at him 

2659
02:04:51,550 --> 02:04:52,383
throwing punches.
Like he's like some sort of a boxer 

2660
02:04:55,291 --> 02:04:57,120
character with this giant water balloon 
arms,

2661
02:04:57,960 --> 02:05:00,780
but he's an abuser of something.
How many people are,

2662
02:05:00,820 --> 02:05:03,930
uh,
a more reasonable user of it and use it.

2663
02:05:03,990 --> 02:05:06,270
And that's what somebody thought that 
the carrot top stuff was,

2664
02:05:06,910 --> 02:05:07,820
it's real common.
Yeah.

2665
02:05:07,821 --> 02:05:12,000
He's um,
powerful arm wrestled guy has one arm.

2666
02:05:12,001 --> 02:05:15,020
It's way more Jack.
Yeah.

2667
02:05:15,030 --> 02:05:18,330
That can't be good for you bro.
That's real.

2668
02:05:18,360 --> 02:05:19,320
Yup.
Yup.

2669
02:05:20,370 --> 02:05:25,190
He smashes people in arm wrestling.
It's so crazy like,

2670
02:05:25,200 --> 02:05:26,430
come on man.
What is that?

2671
02:05:26,730 --> 02:05:27,563
Don't do that dude.
He's probably going to be hurting when 

2672
02:05:30,571 --> 02:05:31,350
he gets older.

2673
02:05:31,350 --> 02:05:33,570
We were at yesterday.
Brian might know because he's likes this

2674
02:05:33,571 --> 02:05:34,404
topic.
Have you heard of the Korean Hawk guy 

2675
02:05:36,061 --> 02:05:37,800
that's supposedly dating Lindsay Lohan?
Yeah.

2676
02:05:37,830 --> 02:05:42,830
Right now all of a sudden it shows tmz.
Jamie jumps in with relationship gossip.

2677
02:05:43,320 --> 02:05:46,350
You son of a bitch.
That's what you do every time.

2678
02:05:46,530 --> 02:05:48,720
Well,
they posted a photo last night,

2679
02:05:48,721 --> 02:05:51,540
Jamie,
and you know she's dealing with the irs,

2680
02:05:51,541 --> 02:05:52,150
right

2681
02:05:52,150 --> 02:05:53,140
guys,
super jacked.

2682
02:05:53,440 --> 02:05:55,910
Holy Shit.
Look at this dog.

2683
02:05:56,800 --> 02:05:59,020
He's living with a werewolf that's like 
a monkey werewolf.

2684
02:05:59,880 --> 02:06:01,560
I tell you man,
I love Korean.

2685
02:06:01,600 --> 02:06:04,260
Uh,
we had a family dinner for my girlfriend

2686
02:06:04,261 --> 02:06:07,140
the other day and I come in and they're 
cupping or doing that thing where they,

2687
02:06:07,470 --> 02:06:08,303
they like picture a little and then they
put these glasses and they pretty much 

2688
02:06:12,871 --> 02:06:13,704
suck the bad blood out of you.
So I walk in and there's just blood 

2689
02:06:16,591 --> 02:06:18,160
everywhere and towels and,
and,

2690
02:06:18,161 --> 02:06:19,410
and,
and shit like that.

2691
02:06:20,370 --> 02:06:21,780
What is it supposed to do?
It's supposed to.

2692
02:06:21,781 --> 02:06:23,010
We've talked about this before,
right?

2693
02:06:23,011 --> 02:06:26,670
It's supposed to some accelerate blood 
flow to the area,

2694
02:06:26,671 --> 02:06:28,350
like polls,
the tissue,

2695
02:06:28,351 --> 02:06:30,840
the skin away from it and accelerates 
blood flow.

2696
02:06:30,870 --> 02:06:33,570
Sometimes the blood comes out as gel,
which is weird.

2697
02:06:33,571 --> 02:06:35,790
It's supposed to,
but there's what,

2698
02:06:35,800 --> 02:06:39,120
I didn't know his lot it cause I posted 
a video of it while they were doing it.

2699
02:06:39,480 --> 02:06:41,640
A lot of people are saying that cuppings
bad for you.

2700
02:06:41,641 --> 02:06:43,440
And then I did research.
There is,

2701
02:06:43,441 --> 02:06:45,240
if it goes bad,
it goes bad.

2702
02:06:45,241 --> 02:06:48,330
It leaves permanent damage if they,
if they don't do it right.

2703
02:06:48,331 --> 02:06:49,890
And really,
yeah,

2704
02:06:49,910 --> 02:06:50,743
if there's some photos that are pretty 
disturbing where like pretty much just 

2705
02:06:54,091 --> 02:06:57,030
holes in people's backs.
Oh fuck yeah.

2706
02:06:57,060 --> 02:06:59,460
But yet then the Olympians do it,
you know,

2707
02:06:59,490 --> 02:07:01,110
like people that people for the Olympics
do it.

2708
02:07:01,111 --> 02:07:02,010
So it's like,
what's,

2709
02:07:02,040 --> 02:07:02,873
you know,

2710
02:07:02,920 --> 02:07:05,800
well I don't know shit about medicine,
but I would imagine,

2711
02:07:07,090 --> 02:07:07,923
oh my God,
what is that cup and gone back and he's 

2712
02:07:10,271 --> 02:07:13,990
man left with horrific holes in back 
after botched.

2713
02:07:14,770 --> 02:07:16,450
Whoa.
That's awful.

2714
02:07:17,320 --> 02:07:19,450
That could be just somebody who did it 
completely wrong.

2715
02:07:19,630 --> 02:07:20,461
Well.
Well what what,

2716
02:07:20,461 --> 02:07:21,161
what?
What's that one?

2717
02:07:21,161 --> 02:07:23,710
That far right where it looks like it 
horns lower.

2718
02:07:23,711 --> 02:07:25,420
Right.
Lower right the bottom.

2719
02:07:25,750 --> 02:07:27,100
We'll keep going.
Scroll down,

2720
02:07:27,101 --> 02:07:28,000
scroll down.
Scroll down.

2721
02:07:28,030 --> 02:07:31,240
That one to the right in the middle with
the orange and the blue,

2722
02:07:31,390 --> 02:07:33,310
the right all the way to the right.
Jamie,

2723
02:07:33,340 --> 02:07:36,010
the other right edge of the screen.
Go to the

2724
02:07:36,010 --> 02:07:37,330
edge of the screen.
Dot Guy.

2725
02:07:37,390 --> 02:07:38,350
Bam.
Yeah,

2726
02:07:38,420 --> 02:07:43,420
cause he's got horns.
Oh this is a water buffalo horn to being

2727
02:07:45,371 --> 02:07:48,220
used for it,
but they're just using buffalo horn.

2728
02:07:48,230 --> 02:07:49,270
Says Cups.
Oh,

2729
02:07:49,271 --> 02:07:52,570
what copping with buffalo horns.
Look,

2730
02:07:52,600 --> 02:07:54,220
Rogan does.
So Yo Bro,

2731
02:07:54,340 --> 02:07:58,030
I do that based on my balls,
my nig route.

2732
02:07:58,750 --> 02:08:02,740
What made sense to me is that you would 
kind of like create damage,

2733
02:08:02,770 --> 02:08:07,660
which is while that blood exists and 
that maybe that it'd be like almost like

2734
02:08:07,661 --> 02:08:08,494
a prp sort of a thing where all that 
extra blood that you've created from 

2735
02:08:11,831 --> 02:08:16,410
that area would go and help the blood 
flow to the part that's injured and they

2736
02:08:16,411 --> 02:08:19,360
accelerate healing.
He never know man,

2737
02:08:19,361 --> 02:08:20,194
because it's,
you can't say that people that are in 

2738
02:08:21,641 --> 02:08:22,474
the Olympics don't ever do anything 
stupid cause they definitely would do 

2739
02:08:25,061 --> 02:08:25,894
something stupid.
Someone can talk to him in and doing a 

2740
02:08:27,251 --> 02:08:30,520
bunch of shit if he,
if sometimes like the psychological edge

2741
02:08:30,521 --> 02:08:33,010
and believing that there's something 
that's going to work really good,

2742
02:08:33,130 --> 02:08:35,380
we'll be just enough to get a few people
to do it.

2743
02:08:36,670 --> 02:08:37,503
But this has been around for a while.
This has been around long enough where 

2744
02:08:39,701 --> 02:08:42,400
people are going like,
you know there's like really significant

2745
02:08:42,401 --> 02:08:47,401
benefits things real.
They really do it that way.

2746
02:08:48,670 --> 02:08:50,650
Yeah.
It's almost like traditional for I guess

2747
02:08:50,651 --> 02:08:53,410
Korean culture because I mean they were 
just doing it like it was nothing.

2748
02:08:53,411 --> 02:08:55,510
I had a family dinner.
That's crazy.

2749
02:08:55,990 --> 02:08:58,210
That's crazy.
But maybe that works,

2750
02:08:58,650 --> 02:08:59,483
you know?
I mean the only way you find out of 

2751
02:09:01,091 --> 02:09:01,924
stuff like this works,
which is like a really unconventional 

2752
02:09:03,881 --> 02:09:05,290
therapy is you've got to try it.

2753
02:09:07,390 --> 02:09:08,223
If all those super genius type guys that
are training these Olympic athletes and 

2754
02:09:12,220 --> 02:09:16,630
getting them to peak performance and 
what could potentially be worth millions

2755
02:09:16,630 --> 02:09:18,400
and millions of dollars in sponsorship 
money if they win the gold medal,

2756
02:09:18,520 --> 02:09:19,353
if they're having these people get all 
cupped up is probably something to it 

2757
02:09:21,970 --> 02:09:25,180
kept up right in this day and age.
I think it's like acupuncture.

2758
02:09:25,181 --> 02:09:27,970
I feel like I don't know enough to know 
if that's accurate or not.

2759
02:09:27,971 --> 02:09:28,804
It seems like it is.
Some people believe in it a lot cause 

2760
02:09:31,241 --> 02:09:32,920
they pay a lot of money for it.
Do it all the time.

2761
02:09:33,310 --> 02:09:34,210
Yeah,
for sure.

2762
02:09:34,280 --> 02:09:35,113
Um,
a lot of people do believe in 

2763
02:09:35,621 --> 02:09:36,454
acupuncture,
but copping seems to me to be like more 

2764
02:09:38,681 --> 02:09:39,514
next level.
It's like you're pulling the skin away 

2765
02:09:41,111 --> 02:09:41,944
from the area to the point where it 
bleeds and turns into the big ass 

2766
02:09:44,351 --> 02:09:45,184
bruise.
They have this giant circle red spot 

2767
02:09:47,860 --> 02:09:51,920
where the increased blood flow hasn't 
been filtered out of the body.

2768
02:09:51,920 --> 02:09:52,753
Yeah.
Like you got some weird shit happened 

2769
02:09:53,611 --> 02:09:54,820
there.
That ain't normal thing.

2770
02:09:55,120 --> 02:09:57,850
You got a big circle bruise on your 
back,

2771
02:09:57,851 --> 02:09:59,590
right where you're hurt.
Oh,

2772
02:09:59,591 --> 02:10:00,424
I see what you're doing.
You're making it all bleed in there so 

2773
02:10:01,691 --> 02:10:04,090
it flows everything out of there and 
heals it up quicker.

2774
02:10:04,300 --> 02:10:06,370
It kind of makes sense to a dummy like 
me,

2775
02:10:06,700 --> 02:10:07,533
like I don't know anything about how the
actual body functions in terms of like 

2776
02:10:10,001 --> 02:10:12,580
how things heal and whether or not it 
would accelerate or not,

2777
02:10:12,581 --> 02:10:15,270
but that Michael Phelps guys doing it.
Yeah.

2778
02:10:15,460 --> 02:10:17,980
When I asked him how has it feel 
afterwards,

2779
02:10:17,981 --> 02:10:22,570
he says it took a refreshing,
I feel way energetic now and relaxed.

2780
02:10:23,190 --> 02:10:24,023
Well it's like people that wanted to 
deny the benefits of cryotherapy before 

2781
02:10:27,671 --> 02:10:28,504
like some papers came out.
There's a lot of people poopooing and 

2782
02:10:31,360 --> 02:10:34,730
partly for good reason.
It's cause a lot of the people that were

2783
02:10:34,731 --> 02:10:38,600
running these cryotherapy sites got 
overzealous in their claims.

2784
02:10:38,990 --> 02:10:39,823
They got real overzealous in their 
claims of like how much weight you can 

2785
02:10:43,911 --> 02:10:45,860
lose,
how much better you can look,

2786
02:10:45,861 --> 02:10:46,694
all these different things that may or 
may not be true when it comes to throw 

2787
02:10:49,690 --> 02:10:51,680
cryotherapy,
especially in the way they described it,

2788
02:10:51,681 --> 02:10:55,700
but what can't be denied is the way it 
makes you feel.

2789
02:10:56,150 --> 02:11:00,020
It makes you feel fucking amazing.
You do three minutes.

2790
02:11:00,021 --> 02:11:02,990
And while that was crappy prior therapy 
places you come out of there like,

2791
02:11:02,991 --> 02:11:03,824
whoa,
everybody I know that's tried has been 

2792
02:11:05,091 --> 02:11:06,350
like,
whoa.

2793
02:11:06,590 --> 02:11:08,330
Like I,
I'll give a lot for that.

2794
02:11:08,331 --> 02:11:09,980
Woo.
Like that was good,

2795
02:11:11,360 --> 02:11:12,193
but everybody's right to be suspicious 
because the part before the world was 

2796
02:11:14,901 --> 02:11:16,510
annoying.
There was like a lot I like,

2797
02:11:16,511 --> 02:11:18,670
you know,
like in [inaudible] college in your skin

2798
02:11:18,671 --> 02:11:19,504
and it's like a virtual face lift and 
like there's a lot of people are 

2799
02:11:21,831 --> 02:11:24,470
claiming some night,
where's this?

2800
02:11:24,500 --> 02:11:25,880
You gotta you gotta be able to prove 
that,

2801
02:11:25,881 --> 02:11:28,520
but they can prove anti inflammatory 
markers in the blood.

2802
02:11:28,521 --> 02:11:29,810
They can prove all these like,
um,

2803
02:11:30,050 --> 02:11:31,470
hormones and these,
um,

2804
02:11:32,100 --> 02:11:35,200
neurochemicals that your brain can,
can make when you're a,

2805
02:11:35,210 --> 02:11:38,930
you're in that tank when a cryotherapy 
chamber rather,

2806
02:11:40,460 --> 02:11:43,900
you done it yet.
Now I want to do it today and now.

2807
02:11:45,230 --> 02:11:47,840
Still be good to get you to do it today.
Yeah,

2808
02:11:48,920 --> 02:11:52,060
maybe I would ever see.
I'll definitely do it.

2809
02:11:52,061 --> 02:11:52,894
I just,
today I don't,

2810
02:11:52,910 --> 02:11:55,100
I don't feel great.
Don't be a poser.

2811
02:11:55,250 --> 02:11:56,320
May make you feel better.
I hate it.

2812
02:11:56,321 --> 02:11:57,154
Hate it.
I had a milkshake last night and I have 

2813
02:11:58,050 --> 02:12:00,020
two minutes in there.
Woke up at six in the morning.

2814
02:12:00,320 --> 02:12:01,153
This is the whole podcast has been a 
ruse to get me to get you into the 

2815
02:12:03,771 --> 02:12:04,604
cryotherapy chamber.
I don't want to do a couple of sesh 

2816
02:12:08,920 --> 02:12:10,870
youtube.
This youtube,

2817
02:12:11,580 --> 02:12:14,210
someone's going to burn.
You'll touch the wall.

2818
02:12:14,211 --> 02:12:16,220
Test the laws,
but people do go in as couples,

2819
02:12:16,250 --> 02:12:17,990
but you gotta be like right close to 
each other.

2820
02:12:18,710 --> 02:12:20,330
Yeah.
People like to endorse it together.

2821
02:12:21,060 --> 02:12:25,100
Tom Air.
Do you have a tank here now though?

2822
02:12:25,280 --> 02:12:26,113
Yes,
we do.

2823
02:12:26,270 --> 02:12:27,140
That's cool.
Yes.

2824
02:12:27,141 --> 02:12:32,141
We did a crash crash.
Made it float lab.

2825
02:12:33,320 --> 02:12:34,840
Shout out to the float lab.
Float lab.

2826
02:12:34,850 --> 02:12:36,350
Dennis Westwood.
Yeah.

2827
02:12:36,380 --> 02:12:37,213
Crashed.
Put it in there.

2828
02:12:37,730 --> 02:12:39,500
He's a wizard.
He knows how to do it.

2829
02:12:40,460 --> 02:12:45,460
It's all crazy.
Filter ozone and UV light filters.

2830
02:12:46,700 --> 02:12:48,600
One Micron field.
He was explaining it all to me.

2831
02:12:48,630 --> 02:12:50,630
It was like,
it sounds good.

2832
02:12:50,840 --> 02:12:55,130
It sounds like you did good shit.
I'm too fucking dumb.

2833
02:12:55,250 --> 02:12:56,900
Plus I can't pay attention to 
everything.

2834
02:12:56,930 --> 02:12:57,830
That's a problem,
man.

2835
02:12:58,160 --> 02:12:59,930
That's how I feel when people keep 
bringing up bitcoin.

2836
02:12:59,990 --> 02:13:01,700
I was like,
let me know.

2837
02:13:01,760 --> 02:13:03,110
Let me know when you get this sorted 
out.

2838
02:13:03,111 --> 02:13:04,880
Because I watched a lot of,
uh,

2839
02:13:04,881 --> 02:13:07,940
a lot of things.
I can't follow the bitcoin show.

2840
02:13:08,300 --> 02:13:09,111
I can't,
I just,

2841
02:13:09,111 --> 02:13:11,660
I can't.
So when we got those bitcoins,

2842
02:13:11,940 --> 02:13:12,620
man,
when I,

2843
02:13:12,620 --> 02:13:14,900
when he gave us bitcoin's a long time 
ago,

2844
02:13:15,080 --> 02:13:16,260
who gave us a bit of,
uh,

2845
02:13:16,880 --> 02:13:18,500
Andrea plus,
right?

2846
02:13:19,220 --> 02:13:23,060
I've been trying to open up my wallet or
find my password to that wallet.

2847
02:13:23,300 --> 02:13:24,290
It's gone.
Like,

2848
02:13:24,291 --> 02:13:25,124
I,
I'll never be able to get that bit coin 

2849
02:13:26,240 --> 02:13:27,073
he gave him,
even though it was only at the 

2850
02:13:28,260 --> 02:13:30,050
University of it.
Let it be a statistical anomaly.

2851
02:13:30,230 --> 02:13:33,180
It's probably worth of dollars,
billions,

2852
02:13:33,180 --> 02:13:34,013
billions for now.
It's like you get in and get out and 

2853
02:13:35,191 --> 02:13:39,930
people are accusing people of pump and 
dumps and there's subterfuge.

2854
02:13:40,350 --> 02:13:41,183
Subterfuge is taken into consideration 
of some of the highs and the lows 

2855
02:13:43,560 --> 02:13:44,670
anyway,
of course.

2856
02:13:44,790 --> 02:13:46,590
Just like everything,
right?

2857
02:13:47,250 --> 02:13:51,060
Like big corporations taking over shit.
It's like these,

2858
02:13:51,061 --> 02:13:53,320
uh,
these patterns are not normal.

2859
02:13:53,400 --> 02:13:54,720
They're normal.
You see them coming.

2860
02:13:56,040 --> 02:13:57,470
If you're going to have something like 
Bitcoin,

2861
02:13:57,471 --> 02:13:59,730
you're going to have people for sure.
Not everyone's going to be,

2862
02:13:59,731 --> 02:14:00,564
well,
hey man,

2863
02:14:00,900 --> 02:14:02,940
I'm a fucking thief.
But now with Bitcoin,

2864
02:14:03,420 --> 02:14:06,090
bitcoin would be super cool.
No more deception.

2865
02:14:06,180 --> 02:14:08,260
This is about the future.
It's resolution,

2866
02:14:08,350 --> 02:14:11,220
it's about resolution.
This is about the children.

2867
02:14:11,940 --> 02:14:15,360
Now anybody's a scam artist is going to 
be a scam artist and anything they can,

2868
02:14:15,600 --> 02:14:20,600
whether it's a re a fake religion or 
fake dating site or fucking whatever,

2869
02:14:21,810 --> 02:14:24,000
whatever they could do.
Whatever they can get you with,

2870
02:14:24,030 --> 02:14:25,590
they're going to get you with like,
oh,

2871
02:14:25,591 --> 02:14:27,150
this is what you guys do now.
Okay,

2872
02:14:27,210 --> 02:14:29,490
I'll pretend to be that operate in 
there.

2873
02:14:30,240 --> 02:14:31,073
Right.

2874
02:14:33,090 --> 02:14:33,923
What do you think is the next big 
breakthrough that's going to change in 

2875
02:14:38,401 --> 02:14:43,401
terms of like how technology and people 
get along?

2876
02:14:48,030 --> 02:14:49,550
He's going to be a robot.
Sex Doll.

2877
02:14:50,340 --> 02:14:52,670
No,
I think home home,

2878
02:14:52,690 --> 02:14:53,950
uh,
assistance,

2879
02:14:54,340 --> 02:14:55,173
you know,
like having a robot couldn't be your 

2880
02:14:57,131 --> 02:14:58,960
home base.
Like computer.

2881
02:14:59,890 --> 02:15:00,723
Uh,
I dunno like these Alexis and I'll like 

2882
02:15:02,530 --> 02:15:06,580
apple's about to release Thurs and 
Google has released Thurs and

2883
02:15:06,930 --> 02:15:10,670
I seen the autonomous robots that 
monitor parking lots now.

2884
02:15:11,180 --> 02:15:14,840
Yeah,
I tweeted it I think yesterday,

2885
02:15:16,100 --> 02:15:16,933
but definitely robots.
We're going to give up our security and 

2886
02:15:20,031 --> 02:15:21,890
all our privacy at the same time.

2887
02:15:22,460 --> 02:15:23,293
Hmm.

2888
02:15:23,760 --> 02:15:26,700
We're going to be fine because the robot
is going to be watching us.

2889
02:15:26,820 --> 02:15:28,080
Keep an eye on me.
Robot.

2890
02:15:28,200 --> 02:15:31,530
This is going to be zero privacy,
zero.

2891
02:15:31,680 --> 02:15:33,450
It's real close.
That's already there.

2892
02:15:33,660 --> 02:15:36,270
But I mean real close to not just 
regular zero privacy,

2893
02:15:36,271 --> 02:15:38,940
but like no one ever has a moment alone 
ever.

2894
02:15:39,450 --> 02:15:42,260
It doesn't exist anymore.
Like it will slowly erode.

2895
02:15:42,280 --> 02:15:45,300
Then you'd go into the mountains in the 
put cell phone towers out there and then

2896
02:15:45,301 --> 02:15:47,910
it's going to be it.
Whatever the technology is,

2897
02:15:47,911 --> 02:15:48,744
it's going to be,
you're going to know where everyone is 

2898
02:15:51,121 --> 02:15:54,120
at any moment and we're going to really 
get to know each other.

2899
02:15:58,190 --> 02:15:58,910
What do you got Jamie?

2900
02:15:58,910 --> 02:16:01,790
I was looking up for the thing I saw.
I saw,

2901
02:16:01,791 --> 02:16:03,200
and it wasn't on your twitter feed.
I guess.

2902
02:16:03,201 --> 02:16:05,840
I saw a video of like autonomous parking
robots,

2903
02:16:05,850 --> 02:16:08,600
building cars in and out of spots.
I didn't put it on twitter.

2904
02:16:08,630 --> 02:16:09,463
I thought it did

2905
02:16:09,510 --> 02:16:10,710
shit.
Um,

2906
02:16:10,740 --> 02:16:11,780
it was,
uh,

2907
02:16:12,670 --> 02:16:14,220
a comp.
Appreciate.

2908
02:16:14,221 --> 02:16:15,930
I retweeted it.
You know what it does though.

2909
02:16:15,990 --> 02:16:17,880
I think I retweeted somebody else 
saying,

2910
02:16:18,210 --> 02:16:19,043
hey,
this is happening or something like 

2911
02:16:19,951 --> 02:16:22,140
that.
So it's probably not that clear.

2912
02:16:22,380 --> 02:16:27,210
One of the more recent tweets tapping 
and Brian,

2913
02:16:27,510 --> 02:16:29,710
they're going to be flying around us 
monitoring us.

2914
02:16:29,740 --> 02:16:30,100
You saw that

2915
02:16:30,100 --> 02:16:32,020
one robot,
I think it was in San Francisco.

2916
02:16:32,470 --> 02:16:34,150
Beat up homeless people or something 
like that.

2917
02:16:34,210 --> 02:16:35,420
Good move.
Yeah.

2918
02:16:35,600 --> 02:16:37,840
And stuff like that happens.
There's going to be a big pull back.

2919
02:16:38,270 --> 02:16:39,410
It's crazy.
Robots.

2920
02:16:39,430 --> 02:16:40,263
Fucking homes.
We need robots picking on the 

2921
02:16:41,921 --> 02:16:44,320
downtrodden.
That's good move.

2922
02:16:44,590 --> 02:16:46,330
Let them know you post.
These are on your way out.

2923
02:16:46,480 --> 02:16:47,313
The robots are here.
I mean that literally is like the first 

2924
02:16:50,111 --> 02:16:53,230
wave of immigrants from the silicone 
world.

2925
02:16:53,530 --> 02:16:56,830
Robots at fuck with homeless people.
The first,

2926
02:16:57,100 --> 02:16:59,410
the first invaders tripping them and 
stuff.

2927
02:17:00,010 --> 02:17:00,843
I robot.
The thing about I robot as you'd watch 

2928
02:17:03,581 --> 02:17:06,070
it and it was,
it was made just at the right time.

2929
02:17:06,430 --> 02:17:08,680
It was made where you didn't think it's 
ever possible.

2930
02:17:09,010 --> 02:17:11,020
It's made at a time.
Well this is pretty cool.

2931
02:17:11,050 --> 02:17:12,400
Like yeah man.
The future.

2932
02:17:12,460 --> 02:17:13,660
Yeah.
I could see it being real.

2933
02:17:14,200 --> 02:17:15,033
But you didn't think it was really 
possible and now you watch I robot and 

2934
02:17:17,621 --> 02:17:18,790
you go,
oh,

2935
02:17:18,791 --> 02:17:19,840
it's inevitable.

2936
02:17:19,990 --> 02:17:20,823
That's inevitable.
That thing that does the robot thing w 

2937
02:17:23,740 --> 02:17:26,320
pretends to be a person and looks real 
freaky.

2938
02:17:26,321 --> 02:17:29,950
That's easily doable.
Or we set machinima.

2939
02:17:30,200 --> 02:17:31,960
What's that one?
That's it.

2940
02:17:31,961 --> 02:17:32,794
Security robots are using two w uh,
are being used to ward off San 

2941
02:17:36,010 --> 02:17:39,120
Francisco's homeless population.
That's the drug.

2942
02:17:39,130 --> 02:17:40,360
What's it called?
Who makes that thing?

2943
02:17:41,220 --> 02:17:43,840
Say they retired it.
Oh,

2944
02:17:43,841 --> 02:17:46,600
they did.
There's a whole company that makes those

2945
02:17:46,601 --> 02:17:51,040
things and has them like wandering 
around parking lots and I'm man,

2946
02:17:51,041 --> 02:17:55,300
I hope I retweeted it.
I tried to um,

2947
02:17:55,510 --> 02:17:58,030
somebody sent it to me and I was like,
okay,

2948
02:17:58,060 --> 02:17:58,893
that's how it happens.
They just have these things wandering 

2949
02:18:00,311 --> 02:18:01,480
around,
recording everything.

2950
02:18:01,481 --> 02:18:04,390
So everybody's responsible for any car 
accident.

2951
02:18:04,420 --> 02:18:07,840
Anything that ever happens if it hears 
is someone's screaming rape.

2952
02:18:07,870 --> 02:18:08,703
If it hears someone's screening police 
and immediately goes to the scene and 

2953
02:18:11,201 --> 02:18:12,034
films,
there's no worries about its own 

2954
02:18:12,911 --> 02:18:13,630
mortality.

2955
02:18:13,630 --> 02:18:14,463
It's streaming in real time.
It gets to record all altercations 

2956
02:18:17,261 --> 02:18:20,260
between people.
Eventually hotels agree.

2957
02:18:20,320 --> 02:18:24,130
As long as this is password secure and 
encrypted,

2958
02:18:24,370 --> 02:18:25,203
they allowed to have the fire detector 
and the corner double as a video camera 

2959
02:18:29,531 --> 02:18:31,150
that records everything in the room at 
all times.

2960
02:18:32,680 --> 02:18:33,760
What's going to happen.
Yeah,

2961
02:18:33,820 --> 02:18:34,653
I agree.
Just got to get used to people watching 

2962
02:18:36,191 --> 02:18:37,024
your fuck and ready.
I took the sticker off my webcam on my 

2963
02:18:41,441 --> 02:18:45,400
laptop a long time jet go joe.
They can watch me all I want.

2964
02:18:46,540 --> 02:18:50,470
I don't know why I'm more nervous about 
this in 2018 this is what silly.

2965
02:18:50,471 --> 02:18:51,304
I mean it's become accelerated like I,
I'm more nervous every year when it 

2966
02:18:54,521 --> 02:18:56,850
comes to technology because I'm not 
nervous in a,

2967
02:18:56,860 --> 02:19:00,280
in a way that I think it's totally 100% 
negative but nervous in the way.

2968
02:19:00,281 --> 02:19:03,490
Like it just seems to me that we might 
be in the middle of something and not be

2969
02:19:03,491 --> 02:19:07,570
paying attention like it,
that it's happening so fucking fast that

2970
02:19:07,571 --> 02:19:08,404
we're caught up in it and it's just wild
wave of change and I'm just trying to 

2971
02:19:12,611 --> 02:19:13,444
make sense of it while it's happening.
But then there's something about like 

2972
02:19:15,401 --> 02:19:16,234
numbers,
like I used to think that saying like 

2973
02:19:19,451 --> 02:19:23,200
the year 2017 2000 it's a stupid,
who cares what year it is?

2974
02:19:23,201 --> 02:19:25,300
It's all just now.
But no,

2975
02:19:25,660 --> 02:19:27,950
there's like a way we feel about it 
differently.

2976
02:19:28,130 --> 02:19:28,611
Like you,
oh,

2977
02:19:28,611 --> 02:19:31,520
it's a fucking 2018 dude,
dude.

2978
02:19:31,521 --> 02:19:33,800
It's like you have a feeling about you 
now.

2979
02:19:34,100 --> 02:19:35,870
It's like we're,
we're very,

2980
02:19:36,170 --> 02:19:40,250
very far ahead in this game.
This is,

2981
02:19:40,310 --> 02:19:43,070
this is the future.
2018 that's a crazy number.

2982
02:19:43,820 --> 02:19:45,320
Hey Man,
it's 1979 nope,

2983
02:19:45,350 --> 02:19:49,520
it's 2018 whoa.
So weird.

2984
02:19:52,130 --> 02:19:54,200
And when does this thing,
like,

2985
02:19:55,040 --> 02:19:55,873
if you had to guess,
how much longer does the human race 

2986
02:19:59,541 --> 02:20:00,740
have?
Six months.

2987
02:20:02,740 --> 02:20:05,090
It seems like if you really had to 
guess,

2988
02:20:05,091 --> 02:20:06,710
we're not going to be here forever.
Right?

2989
02:20:06,920 --> 02:20:10,100
So we're not going to be here a hundred 
thousand years from now or 200,000

2990
02:20:10,101 --> 02:20:11,330
years from now.
We're just not,

2991
02:20:12,300 --> 02:20:14,610
I started listening to the audio book of
Sapiens.

2992
02:20:14,720 --> 02:20:15,553
Yeah.
And that's,

2993
02:20:15,570 --> 02:20:19,200
I feel like that's what it's getting to.
That question you're asking is the first

2994
02:20:19,290 --> 02:20:20,123
couple chapters are leading up to like 
he says it over and over again like 

2995
02:20:22,350 --> 02:20:23,183
thousands of years from now,
maybe 2000 is what it's saying that the 

2996
02:20:25,531 --> 02:20:29,850
human race won't be or human beings 
won't be what we are today.

2997
02:20:29,880 --> 02:20:33,570
We'll be another evolution of whatever 
that is.

2998
02:20:33,571 --> 02:20:35,060
Because off of Australia Pickett.

2999
02:20:35,250 --> 02:20:36,083
Yeah.
I was trying to pick the guests 

3000
02:20:36,920 --> 02:20:39,710
Australia pithiness see if you find any 
good pictures of that thing.

3001
02:20:39,740 --> 02:20:43,680
I mean this is what they think.
They think that that that's what started

3002
02:20:43,681 --> 02:20:44,514
it.
That was when it was like fairly 

3003
02:20:45,441 --> 02:20:47,030
distinctly human.
It's gonna.

3004
02:20:47,300 --> 02:20:49,320
It's gonna keep going.
It's going to go to some new thing.

3005
02:20:50,900 --> 02:20:52,730
There it is.
Look at that thing.

3006
02:20:53,120 --> 02:20:53,953
I mean that's so close.
It's what like a walking upright 

3007
02:20:57,231 --> 02:21:02,120
chimpanzee and then that got smarter and
that got smarter and things kept going.

3008
02:21:02,510 --> 02:21:04,250
But the thing that really fucks you up 
is,

3009
02:21:04,251 --> 02:21:05,084
it's not that long ago.
I think Australia Pythius was less than 

3010
02:21:08,361 --> 02:21:09,560
2 million years.
Right?

3011
02:21:10,160 --> 02:21:13,970
It sounds right.
And then there's a modern homo sapiens,

3012
02:21:13,971 --> 02:21:18,971
which I think they think are somewhere 
in the neighborhood of 300 to 500,000

3013
02:21:19,911 --> 02:21:22,490
years old.
They keep moving it around a little bit.

3014
02:21:22,491 --> 02:21:23,324
When they find some new dead guy,
they find some new bones and they're 

3015
02:21:26,451 --> 02:21:27,111
like,
oh,

3016
02:21:27,111 --> 02:21:27,944
this one's older.

3017
02:21:28,670 --> 02:21:29,503
They got to the iconic guessing.
I want to say they're in the 

3018
02:21:32,121 --> 02:21:34,250
neighborhood of 300,000
that ain't shit,

3019
02:21:34,790 --> 02:21:35,720
dude.
That ain't shit.

3020
02:21:35,750 --> 02:21:38,630
That just happened.
If that's when they really started.

3021
02:21:38,631 --> 02:21:41,990
That just happened.
So you're talking about 300,000

3022
02:21:41,991 --> 02:21:44,000
years from now.
Uber.

3023
02:21:44,210 --> 02:21:46,400
It's crazy.
We're going to be made out of gas.

3024
02:21:46,401 --> 02:21:48,620
We're going to be like those fires that 
aren't petroleum.

3025
02:21:48,820 --> 02:21:52,580
You won't be able to see us are 
intelligent to be all pervasive.

3026
02:21:52,581 --> 02:21:53,414
We'll,
we'll have a one operating system that 

3027
02:21:55,581 --> 02:21:58,040
we share with mother earth.
They'll plug it into,

3028
02:21:58,041 --> 02:22:00,710
our brains will plug into the ground and
we'll,

3029
02:22:00,770 --> 02:22:04,190
we'll become divine.
How about that?

3030
02:22:04,790 --> 02:22:05,690
No,
I don't know.

3031
02:22:05,780 --> 02:22:07,520
No one's here.
That's how I am.

3032
02:22:07,980 --> 02:22:09,470
Like let him go.
Just go to him.

3033
02:22:09,471 --> 02:22:10,870
He'll come back.
Wow.

3034
02:22:11,080 --> 02:22:13,540
I always wonder what they thought about 
this 200 years ago.

3035
02:22:13,541 --> 02:22:16,960
150 years ago,
what they thought are we,

3036
02:22:17,020 --> 02:22:19,630
I feel like they thought that the world 
is going to end too back then.

3037
02:22:19,770 --> 02:22:20,603
Yeah,
but he's always daughters away from an 

3038
02:22:22,091 --> 02:22:22,480
ending.

3039
02:22:22,480 --> 02:22:23,560
Sure.
I mean anytime,

3040
02:22:23,561 --> 02:22:25,650
anything,
especially back when there was media,

3041
02:22:25,710 --> 02:22:26,130
anytime

3042
02:22:26,130 --> 02:22:28,590
anything catastrophic happened in your 
area,

3043
02:22:29,160 --> 02:22:30,360
you thought that was going to be the 
end.

3044
02:22:31,480 --> 02:22:32,000
Okay.

3045
02:22:32,000 --> 02:22:34,980
And the moon was made as cheese.
It's,

3046
02:22:36,090 --> 02:22:40,500
it's really weird how recent that was.
That's what's weird.

3047
02:22:40,950 --> 02:22:42,900
When you just think about hundreds of 
thousands of years,

3048
02:22:42,901 --> 02:22:47,310
it seems like a long ass time,
but it's not.

3049
02:22:47,311 --> 02:22:50,700
When you talk,
talk about the shape of human beings and

3050
02:22:50,701 --> 02:22:53,400
what what's happened in that amount of 
time,

3051
02:22:53,430 --> 02:22:57,480
especially in the last few hundred or 
few thousand years,

3052
02:22:57,870 --> 02:22:58,703
just all you need is sick.
If you want to like really impress the 

3053
02:23:00,091 --> 02:23:01,650
shit out of people,
give me 10,000

3054
02:23:01,651 --> 02:23:03,180
years,
10,000

3055
02:23:03,181 --> 02:23:04,530
years ago,
10,000

3056
02:23:04,531 --> 02:23:05,370
years now you're like,
wow,

3057
02:23:06,120 --> 02:23:08,670
you'd freak out.
There's no other time in history.

3058
02:23:08,671 --> 02:23:11,160
That would be the case.
Like every other time in history,

3059
02:23:11,280 --> 02:23:12,330
10,000
years would be like,

3060
02:23:12,340 --> 02:23:13,173
whoa.
They figured out how to make cooler 

3061
02:23:14,071 --> 02:23:14,970
houses.
Like,

3062
02:23:14,971 --> 02:23:16,590
Whoa,
he's riding an elephant.

3063
02:23:16,591 --> 02:23:18,060
How do you figure that out?
Like,

3064
02:23:18,061 --> 02:23:18,894
Whoa,
all that bone is way better than my bow 

3065
02:23:20,131 --> 02:23:21,810
and Arrow every 10,000
years,

3066
02:23:22,200 --> 02:23:23,940
no big deal.
And then all of a sudden,

3067
02:23:23,941 --> 02:23:27,480
one 10,000
year period and you have everything,

3068
02:23:27,600 --> 02:23:30,960
you got the pyramids,
you got space travel,

3069
02:23:30,990 --> 02:23:34,680
you've got the internet,
you've got video photography,

3070
02:23:35,220 --> 02:23:36,420
three d printers.

3071
02:23:36,690 --> 02:23:38,220
Every time you say something like this,
this,

3072
02:23:38,550 --> 02:23:39,870
uh,
pops in my head,

3073
02:23:39,871 --> 02:23:40,704
the end of gangs in New York,
which shows that montage of the hundred 

3074
02:23:43,950 --> 02:23:46,000
years or so of New York changing.
Nice.

3075
02:23:46,020 --> 02:23:46,853
Thinking about how that's only a hundred
years in New York changed from this 

3076
02:23:49,981 --> 02:23:50,814
crazy nothingness even though it's 
really big then to like tons of 

3077
02:23:54,991 --> 02:23:57,690
skyscrapers and bridges and all of what 
it is today.

3078
02:23:58,140 --> 02:24:00,360
And it wasn't any,
anything close to that back then.

3079
02:24:00,361 --> 02:24:02,760
And that's like what a hundred years?
And you're talking about 10,000

3080
02:24:03,170 --> 02:24:05,400
but that's so much more time compared to
a hundred.

3081
02:24:05,920 --> 02:24:07,930
Yeah.
That's an amazing montage.

3082
02:24:08,900 --> 02:24:10,370
Timelapse,
what would you call that?

3083
02:24:10,371 --> 02:24:11,890
That's time lapse.
Look at that.

3084
02:24:11,891 --> 02:24:12,790
That's incredible.

3085
02:24:13,650 --> 02:24:14,180
Okay.

3086
02:24:14,180 --> 02:24:15,013
New York City's a freak out man and even
more crazy look at that keeps going and 

3087
02:24:18,620 --> 02:24:20,240
that's even bigger now.
Oh my God.

3088
02:24:20,241 --> 02:24:22,810
And towers aren't there.
Yeah.

3089
02:24:22,811 --> 02:24:25,900
In New York City is a genuine freak out.
Unless you've been,

3090
02:24:25,930 --> 02:24:26,763
you should go.

3091
02:24:28,030 --> 02:24:28,900
If you've been in,
you get it.

3092
02:24:28,901 --> 02:24:29,291
You're like,
yeah,

3093
02:24:29,291 --> 02:24:31,450
it's not so love gone,
but if you haven't been,

3094
02:24:31,480 --> 02:24:34,210
it's a paradigm shifter because you 
realize that it's possible.

3095
02:24:34,420 --> 02:24:36,610
It's such a big city.
I've been a lot of big cities,

3096
02:24:36,910 --> 02:24:37,743
but New York City is so crazy and it's 
the way it's constructed that you go 

3097
02:24:41,531 --> 02:24:42,364
there,
you have like a different feel about 

3098
02:24:43,331 --> 02:24:43,811
you.
You're like,

3099
02:24:43,811 --> 02:24:44,644
Whoa,
okay.

3100
02:24:45,040 --> 02:24:46,450
We're in New York City.
This is,

3101
02:24:46,480 --> 02:24:48,670
this is different.
It is different.

3102
02:24:48,850 --> 02:24:51,610
These buildings are fucking giant.
These people are everywhere.

3103
02:24:51,611 --> 02:24:52,810
This is crazy.
This is,

3104
02:24:53,380 --> 02:24:55,510
this is a different,
completely different feeling

3105
02:24:57,820 --> 02:24:59,590
and different people.
Yeah.

3106
02:24:59,710 --> 02:25:00,543
Unfortunately,
the people are straddled down by the 

3107
02:25:03,911 --> 02:25:04,744
echoes of the emigrants that were their 
great grandparents and their 

3108
02:25:07,901 --> 02:25:08,734
grandparents and their struggle that 
they had to get from Europe over to 

3109
02:25:13,511 --> 02:25:14,344
America.
This is my thought because this is my 

3110
02:25:15,311 --> 02:25:16,480
own family.
I'm talking about.

3111
02:25:16,780 --> 02:25:17,820
I feel like,
uh,

3112
02:25:17,890 --> 02:25:20,740
a lot of the Italian immigrants with my 
grandfather,

3113
02:25:21,460 --> 02:25:22,293
he came over when was boy and his family
and a on both my mom's and my dad's 

3114
02:25:26,531 --> 02:25:28,300
side.
They all came over from Europe,

3115
02:25:28,420 --> 02:25:32,020
from either from Ireland or from Italy.
And they were all like really aggressive

3116
02:25:32,021 --> 02:25:33,820
risk taking people,
you know?

3117
02:25:34,810 --> 02:25:37,330
And those are the people that built that
whole area,

3118
02:25:37,690 --> 02:25:38,523
which is just all you think about like 
what a crazy accomplishment it is to 

3119
02:25:43,601 --> 02:25:48,601
build this gigantic city from all these 
immigrants that came over from Europe,

3120
02:25:48,640 --> 02:25:49,473
you know,
from 1700 whatever it is on just 

3121
02:25:51,300 --> 02:25:53,060
construct and all these incredible 
buildings.

3122
02:25:53,590 --> 02:25:55,990
So very,
very bizarre accomplishment.

3123
02:25:56,650 --> 02:25:58,740
But that same kind of energy,
you know,

3124
02:25:59,000 --> 02:25:59,833
that brought those people over there in 
the first place would create like a lot 

3125
02:26:02,471 --> 02:26:05,200
of interpersonal conflict and a lot of 
aggression.

3126
02:26:05,680 --> 02:26:07,780
I don't know if New York's totally 
gotten past that.

3127
02:26:08,560 --> 02:26:10,300
I think they have more now than ever 
before.

3128
02:26:10,330 --> 02:26:11,163
Like they,
I was reading something about the crime 

3129
02:26:12,221 --> 02:26:14,620
rate that New York's crime rate is 
lowest.

3130
02:26:14,621 --> 02:26:15,970
It's been in a long ass time.

3131
02:26:17,380 --> 02:26:19,090
I think we're at the highest right now.
Right?

3132
02:26:19,120 --> 02:26:19,953
La Is he making this sub?
I feel like I just saw something the 

3133
02:26:22,571 --> 02:26:25,780
other day where if I had more homicides 
this year,

3134
02:26:25,781 --> 02:26:28,780
then recent,
you fall asleep.

3135
02:26:28,840 --> 02:26:31,060
It seems like it.
I'm not trying to remember.

3136
02:26:31,061 --> 02:26:32,590
I think I saw something that was close 
to that,

3137
02:26:32,591 --> 02:26:35,030
but I thought the murder rate was down,
but violent crime was up here.

3138
02:26:35,420 --> 02:26:37,060
Let me just,
we have a police chase.

3139
02:26:37,090 --> 02:26:41,200
More pimps lapse in ever three police 
chases is a day on the TV.

3140
02:26:41,201 --> 02:26:42,460
It's like ridiculous.
How

3141
02:26:43,140 --> 02:26:44,730
that's awesome.
Yeah.

3142
02:26:44,830 --> 02:26:45,663
A police chase their fucking terrifying 
cause you don't want the cops just let 

3143
02:26:47,671 --> 02:26:51,240
someone run away or you don't want the 
cops to slam into you or they're chasing

3144
02:26:51,241 --> 02:26:53,370
some guy,
you know close.

3145
02:26:53,640 --> 02:26:54,473
Yeah.
Crime rates in New York City reached 

3146
02:26:55,651 --> 02:26:59,040
record lows as a article about it.
The blasio.

3147
02:26:59,041 --> 02:26:59,874
That's the guy,
right.

3148
02:27:01,720 --> 02:27:03,900
It's just if you don't know that that's 
possible.

3149
02:27:04,380 --> 02:27:05,213
Going there and seeing that it's 
possible and then realize that its home 

3150
02:27:07,981 --> 02:27:08,814
within a hundred years,
that's where it's mind boggling or 200 

3151
02:27:12,391 --> 02:27:15,660
years or whatever in New York Syndrome 
has been around for in totality.

3152
02:27:17,150 --> 02:27:17,710
Okay.

3153
02:27:17,710 --> 02:27:18,543
What is the world we're experiencing 
right now going to be like in a hundred 

3154
02:27:21,850 --> 02:27:23,020
years?
I mean are

3155
02:27:24,320 --> 02:27:24,950
okay.

3156
02:27:24,950 --> 02:27:25,783
It's,
it almost seems to me like there's no 

3157
02:27:27,241 --> 02:27:28,074
way we're going to be able to guess.
If you look at how quick that 

3158
02:27:29,251 --> 02:27:30,084
accelerated and use that as a pattern.
Like that kind of happened all across 

3159
02:27:33,001 --> 02:27:34,380
the country.
We Chicago,

3160
02:27:34,410 --> 02:27:36,360
La,
San Francisco,

3161
02:27:36,361 --> 02:27:38,310
they all were nothing and then 
everything,

3162
02:27:38,430 --> 02:27:39,070
you know

3163
02:27:39,070 --> 02:27:42,040
say New York won't be here in a hundred 
years because of the water rising up.

3164
02:27:42,041 --> 02:27:43,660
Right.
That would be crazy.

3165
02:27:44,230 --> 02:27:45,310
Fuck fuck.

3166
02:27:46,180 --> 02:27:47,013
Well we have a water crisis and a lot of
parts of the country just got to suck 

3167
02:27:48,821 --> 02:27:53,020
the water out of the ocean and use it to
spray all these dry ass bushes.

3168
02:27:53,021 --> 02:27:53,854
So we stop the fires.
Yo mother thinking I'm always thinking 

3169
02:27:57,460 --> 02:28:00,670
suck the water out of the ocean.
Stop.

3170
02:28:00,910 --> 02:28:01,743
Look,
stop making new houses for a while and 

3171
02:28:03,731 --> 02:28:06,490
start concentrating on sucking the water
out of the ocean to put out the fire.

3172
02:28:06,670 --> 02:28:08,050
Just water.
All those trees.

3173
02:28:08,550 --> 02:28:11,140
Dick,
suck out the water out of the air.

3174
02:28:11,380 --> 02:28:14,980
Like he could just get a bunch of 
humidifiers and then spray the water.

3175
02:28:15,040 --> 02:28:15,873
That's not good because then people 
would dry out and then the botox goes 

3176
02:28:18,581 --> 02:28:19,900
up.
This is what I think.

3177
02:28:20,190 --> 02:28:22,040
They got to figure out how to the salt 
out of the water.

3178
02:28:22,070 --> 02:28:23,450
Right?
They know how to do it,

3179
02:28:23,451 --> 02:28:27,500
but you can't just take ocean water and 
[inaudible] like spray it on your lawn.

3180
02:28:27,710 --> 02:28:29,630
Right.
Kill Your fucking lawn.

3181
02:28:29,880 --> 02:28:31,870
Well on it.
I don't know about that.

3182
02:28:31,871 --> 02:28:33,320
It's fake lawn.
I don't know.

3183
02:28:33,470 --> 02:28:34,303
Then nobody,
I mean if if you have crops in your 

3184
02:28:36,531 --> 02:28:37,364
backyard,
say say if you're growing tomatoes and 

3185
02:28:39,591 --> 02:28:43,370
you decide to water it with ocean water,
would that be a bad idea?

3186
02:28:43,371 --> 02:28:44,110
Yes,

3187
02:28:44,110 --> 02:28:46,090
it would.
Assault would be terrible for it,

3188
02:28:46,200 --> 02:28:47,380
right?
What is that?

3189
02:28:47,500 --> 02:28:48,333
It would just assault would stay,
would kill anything else or just see 

3190
02:28:49,991 --> 02:28:50,620
red.
It's like,

3191
02:28:50,620 --> 02:28:52,150
I don't think that's exactly what rest 
is,

3192
02:28:52,151 --> 02:28:52,984
but it turn into some sort of fucked up 
chemical compound that isn't grass well 

3193
02:28:57,610 --> 02:28:58,443
hard water.

3194
02:28:58,560 --> 02:28:59,393
It kind of poison it.
It'd be a higher salt content than the 

3195
02:29:01,591 --> 02:29:03,390
uh,
the plant wants to exist on.

3196
02:29:03,980 --> 02:29:04,813
And I think that would be the case with 
a lot of stuff that doesn't live in the 

3197
02:29:07,411 --> 02:29:08,250
ocean.
Right.

3198
02:29:09,480 --> 02:29:11,280
So you'd have to figure out a way to get
that salt out.

3199
02:29:11,430 --> 02:29:14,220
But once you did that water be super 
valuable.

3200
02:29:14,280 --> 02:29:17,130
Like we're always low on water just,
and we have too much of it now.

3201
02:29:17,220 --> 02:29:22,220
It starts sucking out of the ocean.
Just use our own need to like we have a,

3202
02:29:23,460 --> 02:29:26,400
a crazy need to use stuff,
you know,

3203
02:29:26,580 --> 02:29:31,260
a constant need.
We have a constant need for consumption.

3204
02:29:31,380 --> 02:29:33,480
So let's consume the water in the ocean,
suck it out.

3205
02:29:33,510 --> 02:29:34,250
They,
they,

3206
02:29:34,250 --> 02:29:35,083
they do it.
It's just very expensive and it's like 

3207
02:29:36,811 --> 02:29:37,644
they do it in San Diego.
I think there's a salt water plant or 

3208
02:29:38,941 --> 02:29:40,080
something.
But yeah,

3209
02:29:40,081 --> 02:29:41,250
we just got to get better at that.

3210
02:29:41,840 --> 02:29:43,310
Better process for it.
Yeah.

3211
02:29:43,311 --> 02:29:46,490
See everybody is concentrating.
All the money is in robot fuck doll.

3212
02:29:46,491 --> 02:29:48,290
So not spending any time working on this
water

3213
02:29:48,450 --> 02:29:50,230
problem must get on top of that,

3214
02:29:52,790 --> 02:29:53,930
bro.
You got to figure this out,

3215
02:29:53,940 --> 02:29:54,773
Ilan.
It can be done and cancer to cancer 

3216
02:29:58,251 --> 02:30:02,060
first.
I think cancer can be severely medicated

3217
02:30:02,061 --> 02:30:02,894
in some circumstances by diet.
And I think that's the thing to 

3218
02:30:06,081 --> 02:30:08,960
concentrate on first before a pill.
Brian,

3219
02:30:09,000 --> 02:30:10,880
that's probably crispr.
Crispr.

3220
02:30:11,510 --> 02:30:14,690
Imagine if there was a way you could 
just eat shit all day and be jacked.

3221
02:30:14,870 --> 02:30:16,970
They Jeremiah Walking boot,
no,

3222
02:30:16,971 --> 02:30:19,010
port Jeremiah.
Don't even say that.

3223
02:30:20,000 --> 02:30:21,710
30 pounds.
Well,

3224
02:30:21,711 --> 02:30:23,540
let's explain to everybody what you're 
talking about,

3225
02:30:24,170 --> 02:30:25,003
John.
So we do that kill Tony Show and 

3226
02:30:26,841 --> 02:30:30,470
Jeremiah Watkins and Tony Hinchcliffe 
kind of copied like,

3227
02:30:30,471 --> 02:30:32,330
you know,
I like the Toms digger formula,

3228
02:30:32,360 --> 02:30:35,990
but backwards to see how much weight 
they can gain in a month.

3229
02:30:36,200 --> 02:30:41,200
Tony did the like working out and trying
to gain muscle weight,

3230
02:30:41,770 --> 02:30:44,240
uh,
where Jeremiah just ate like shit for 30

3231
02:30:44,241 --> 02:30:49,241
days and gain 30 pounds in 30 days where
Tony only gained 2.5

3232
02:30:50,391 --> 02:30:51,380
pounds,
I think it was.

3233
02:30:51,550 --> 02:30:53,770
Yeah.
It was just over three pounds.

3234
02:30:54,340 --> 02:30:55,390
Yeah.
Yeah.

3235
02:30:55,510 --> 02:30:58,960
30 pounds to Tony Hinchcliffe who gained
just over three pounds.

3236
02:30:58,990 --> 02:30:59,823
Jeremiah one nugget.
The hose killed Tony Show and keep his 

3237
02:31:01,241 --> 02:31:02,074
hair.

3238
02:31:02,200 --> 02:31:03,640
Yeah,
the bullshit was in the bed though.

3239
02:31:03,790 --> 02:31:04,623
And one of the most funniest nights I've
had in a long time was you calling out 

3240
02:31:08,591 --> 02:31:12,760
Tony about how it's not fair if Jeremiah
loss,

3241
02:31:12,761 --> 02:31:14,140
he had to shave his head.
Well,

3242
02:31:14,141 --> 02:31:14,900
this is what I said.
I said,

3243
02:31:14,900 --> 02:31:18,300
why this is not an even bet.
Like you guys should both be betting the

3244
02:31:18,301 --> 02:31:20,970
same thing.
Like if Jeremiah wins,

3245
02:31:21,450 --> 02:31:25,170
all he does is get to sit down in a seat
for like a day.

3246
02:31:25,530 --> 02:31:27,390
He gets a hosted,
an episode of the podcast,

3247
02:31:27,391 --> 02:31:29,250
he gets to sit in a seat.
So everybody knows it's funny,

3248
02:31:29,550 --> 02:31:34,550
but if he won or if you want,
he has to shave his fucking head.

3249
02:31:35,670 --> 02:31:36,503
Like that's crazy.
And Jeremiah has nice long hair where 

3250
02:31:39,081 --> 02:31:41,820
Tony has really short hair would have 
grown back in like a day.

3251
02:31:42,350 --> 02:31:43,183
Jeremiah,
his hair seems like kind of a part of 

3252
02:31:44,581 --> 02:31:47,040
who he is.
Like just get silly hair.

3253
02:31:47,070 --> 02:31:49,680
It's just big silly fella.
And,

3254
02:31:49,681 --> 02:31:51,240
uh,
he likes his haircut.

3255
02:31:52,330 --> 02:31:53,163
It just,
but he was willing to do it and I told 

3256
02:31:55,141 --> 02:31:55,621
Tony,
I was like,

3257
02:31:55,621 --> 02:31:56,311
fuck that.
I go,

3258
02:31:56,311 --> 02:31:57,091
look dude,
you got to,

3259
02:31:57,091 --> 02:31:58,410
you guys have to have the same bet.

3260
02:31:58,620 --> 02:31:59,730
I go,
why are you scared to shave your head?

3261
02:31:59,731 --> 02:32:00,840
It'd be amazing.
I go,

3262
02:32:00,841 --> 02:32:01,860
how about this?
How about even better?

3263
02:32:01,861 --> 02:32:04,590
You don't have to shave your head.
You have to wear lipstick on stage for a

3264
02:32:04,590 --> 02:32:05,460
year.
Tony said that.

3265
02:32:05,870 --> 02:32:08,580
What did it Tony Bring it up.
You're like,

3266
02:32:08,581 --> 02:32:10,650
hey joe.
Joe was my joke.

3267
02:32:11,370 --> 02:32:13,680
You don't remember what I did.
I said it.

3268
02:32:13,681 --> 02:32:15,790
And then after I was trying to force him
into doing,

3269
02:32:15,810 --> 02:32:16,740
cause he didn't want to do it.
I go,

3270
02:32:16,741 --> 02:32:17,574
you know what's fucked up?
It was Tony's idea and I just threw him 

3271
02:32:20,071 --> 02:32:21,090
under the bridge.
I was like,

3272
02:32:21,091 --> 02:32:22,560
I don't know why you want to wear 
lipstick,

3273
02:32:22,561 --> 02:32:23,700
man.
This is weird.

3274
02:32:23,760 --> 02:32:25,180
Oh my God.
That he really did.

3275
02:32:25,200 --> 02:32:26,840
No,
no,

3276
02:32:26,850 --> 02:32:27,361
no,
no.

3277
02:32:27,361 --> 02:32:30,090
Do you remember I was saying that 
everybody was dying laughing.

3278
02:32:30,570 --> 02:32:31,403
The reason why everybody was dying 
laughing because they knew I was just 

3279
02:32:32,731 --> 02:32:33,420
fucking with them.

3280
02:32:33,420 --> 02:32:34,710
I was like,
it was his idea,

3281
02:32:34,711 --> 02:32:38,040
which was so weird.
No,

3282
02:32:38,041 --> 02:32:38,874
but the idea was you would have to go on
stage and then once you're on stage you 

3283
02:32:41,101 --> 02:32:43,920
have to put lipstick on or we would 
decide that you,

3284
02:32:43,921 --> 02:32:46,110
uh,
had to have it on when you walked out to

3285
02:32:46,111 --> 02:32:48,900
the crowd either or.
We didn't decide.

3286
02:32:48,901 --> 02:32:50,970
And then you could take it off after 15 
minutes.

3287
02:32:51,150 --> 02:32:55,110
So if you were doing like a headline of 
set somewhere and he'd do an an hour for

3288
02:32:55,111 --> 02:32:56,820
the first 15 minutes,
you're wearing makeup.

3289
02:32:57,230 --> 02:32:58,260
So I said,
but here,

3290
02:32:58,290 --> 02:32:59,123
the thing about that,
the thing about that beautiful red 

3291
02:33:01,021 --> 02:33:06,021
lipstick is that it would make you 
concentrate on a joke about why the fuck

3292
02:33:07,021 --> 02:33:10,080
you were willing to make a bat.
How you lost the bat,

3293
02:33:10,470 --> 02:33:12,450
what you know,
and then rationalize,

3294
02:33:12,480 --> 02:33:14,460
rationalize away about nothing wrong.
How come?

3295
02:33:14,461 --> 02:33:16,740
Chapsticks okay,
but lipstick gain,

3296
02:33:17,040 --> 02:33:18,800
you know,
how come girls get the word lipstick,

3297
02:33:18,810 --> 02:33:19,530
Bro?

3298
02:33:19,530 --> 02:33:22,020
What the fuck are we doing man?
Like what is this?

3299
02:33:22,740 --> 02:33:25,200
Dad had been so funny.
If he had to wear lipstick for a year,

3300
02:33:25,320 --> 02:33:28,340
it would have been hilarious.
He wouldn't,

3301
02:33:28,341 --> 02:33:29,670
it wasn't.
I told them I would do it too.

3302
02:33:30,540 --> 02:33:31,373
Yeah.
You got home?

3303
02:33:31,400 --> 02:33:32,280
Yeah.
I said I'd do it.

3304
02:33:32,400 --> 02:33:33,240
Oh,
so I'll do it too.

3305
02:33:33,300 --> 02:33:34,260
Come on.
We'll all do it together.

3306
02:33:34,470 --> 02:33:36,470
Don't be scared.
Take it back.

3307
02:33:36,930 --> 02:33:39,300
It's not a hard bed.
It's funny.

3308
02:33:40,170 --> 02:33:41,003
You'd have to,
you'd have to like have the lipstick 

3309
02:33:42,570 --> 02:33:45,390
years photos where every time we were on
stage and just what you have,

3310
02:33:45,391 --> 02:33:46,224
you have like a,
like a package of wet wipes with you 

3311
02:33:48,810 --> 02:33:53,280
bring on stage and a dry white towel and
everybody knows you got 15 minutes,

3312
02:33:53,290 --> 02:33:55,920
lipstick time.
You might grow to like it,

3313
02:33:56,610 --> 02:33:58,410
you know,
he might start getting her nails did and

3314
02:33:58,411 --> 02:33:59,244
everything.
You definitely could come up with bits 

3315
02:34:01,711 --> 02:34:02,544
from it.

3316
02:34:02,820 --> 02:34:05,300
It could be possible and it would be fun
for people to,

3317
02:34:05,640 --> 02:34:09,840
to like go along with Tony.
Can't handle that.

3318
02:34:10,640 --> 02:34:12,780
Johnny scared.
I feel like he's scared.

3319
02:34:12,781 --> 02:34:13,614
Right.
I think it should at least shave his 

3320
02:34:14,551 --> 02:34:17,040
head.
He should've shaved his head.

3321
02:34:17,290 --> 02:34:20,440
He should've had a deal.
Obviously he has way more beautiful hair

3322
02:34:20,441 --> 02:34:21,730
than I do.
And,

3323
02:34:21,731 --> 02:34:22,564
um,
but I feel like if I had good hair and 

3324
02:34:24,431 --> 02:34:26,500
shave it off cause I knew it would come 
back.

3325
02:34:26,530 --> 02:34:28,390
It's super shit.
Tony has super shirts.

3326
02:34:28,570 --> 02:34:31,720
Tony Hinchcliffe man,
that's Eddie Izzard,

3327
02:34:31,930 --> 02:34:35,290
Eddie Izzard and lipstick on is Eddie 
Izzard.

3328
02:34:35,770 --> 02:34:36,603
Um,
living as a woman now somebody told me 

3329
02:34:39,281 --> 02:34:40,630
that I really,
yeah.

3330
02:34:40,930 --> 02:34:42,010
Yep.
Mom,

3331
02:34:42,100 --> 02:34:42,933
not necessarily living as a woman.
It's still looks like as Eddie has her 

3332
02:34:45,531 --> 02:34:48,130
dress with lipstick and a dress.
I Dunno.

3333
02:34:48,910 --> 02:34:52,360
Um,
Eddie Izzard we'll have my respect for,

3334
02:34:53,020 --> 02:34:56,110
for all his days because Eddie Izzard,
uh,

3335
02:34:56,410 --> 02:35:01,410
ran a marathon a day with no training 
all around Ireland.

3336
02:35:04,330 --> 02:35:05,740
Do you know about that thing?
Dude?

3337
02:35:06,110 --> 02:35:08,080
He didn't even prepare for it.
Wow.

3338
02:35:08,170 --> 02:35:10,120
He didn't even prepare for it.
He just finished him.

3339
02:35:10,270 --> 02:35:11,830
Yes,
he did it all.

3340
02:35:11,890 --> 02:35:15,130
Wow.
He wrote up marathon a day for like four

3341
02:35:15,131 --> 02:35:16,600
weeks or something crazy.
Right.

3342
02:35:16,601 --> 02:35:20,080
Wasn't it dude,
his feet were literally falling apart.

3343
02:35:20,470 --> 02:35:24,040
Like they would show them cleaning up 
his feet and taking care of his skin.

3344
02:35:24,041 --> 02:35:26,170
It was just torn to pieces,
mad.

3345
02:35:26,860 --> 02:35:31,860
It was just straight,
raw mental toughness and a resolve that,

3346
02:35:33,120 --> 02:35:34,240
I mean,
you think about him,

3347
02:35:34,241 --> 02:35:37,630
you think about him as a comedian,
a funny guy,

3348
02:35:37,631 --> 02:35:38,464
a thoughtful guy,
and he had that odd thing that he was 

3349
02:35:40,331 --> 02:35:43,780
doing where he was wearing women's 
clothes and all that stuff.

3350
02:35:44,050 --> 02:35:46,360
27 marathons in 27 days.
Yeah,

3351
02:35:46,361 --> 02:35:47,194
you don't,
you don't really know what that guy's 

3352
02:35:49,600 --> 02:35:53,440
about until you watch this documentary 
that you could watch online.

3353
02:35:54,010 --> 02:35:55,660
Um,
what does it,

3354
02:35:55,730 --> 02:35:57,760
is there a name for it where people can 
search it?

3355
02:35:58,510 --> 02:35:59,470
It's amazing,
man.

3356
02:36:00,250 --> 02:36:02,710
You'll find it.
So,

3357
02:36:03,820 --> 02:36:05,680
um,
what he did was,

3358
02:36:05,740 --> 02:36:06,573
I don't,
I don't even remember what the charity 

3359
02:36:07,241 --> 02:36:08,620
was.
Do you remember what the charity was?

3360
02:36:09,870 --> 02:36:12,970
Was some sort of a charity?
If he did the 27 marathons,

3361
02:36:13,690 --> 02:36:15,970
I think he only took a couple of days 
off,

3362
02:36:16,460 --> 02:36:17,293
like they're here and there.
There were days where he literally 

3363
02:36:18,821 --> 02:36:19,870
couldn't,
couldn't walk.

3364
02:36:19,940 --> 02:36:20,773
He like,
he had to,

3365
02:36:20,990 --> 02:36:23,650
I feel like he did this twice to Jesus 
Christ.

3366
02:36:23,740 --> 02:36:26,410
This says he did 43 marathons in 51 
days.

3367
02:36:26,470 --> 02:36:28,440
Oh my God.
Oh my.

3368
02:36:28,630 --> 02:36:31,480
That might be the new thing.
He did it again.

3369
02:36:32,050 --> 02:36:32,883
I bet it was a marathon.
Man Doesn't show 43 marathons in 51 

3370
02:36:36,281 --> 02:36:37,420
days.
Oh my God.

3371
02:36:37,421 --> 02:36:38,254
So he did it before.
He did less and then he came back and 

3372
02:36:40,781 --> 02:36:41,850
did it again.
Wow.

3373
02:36:42,040 --> 02:36:43,600
Somebody told me about it a few years 
ago,

3374
02:36:43,601 --> 02:36:44,434
but it was after the fact.
I didn't know he's done it twice kinds 

3375
02:36:47,230 --> 02:36:48,850
of fucking animal.
It's crazy.

3376
02:36:49,060 --> 02:36:50,320
He's an animal.
I mean,

3377
02:36:50,321 --> 02:36:52,630
that's just crazy.
But then I read something,

3378
02:36:52,660 --> 02:36:54,820
um,
unrelated.

3379
02:36:55,000 --> 02:36:56,280
I read something that he,
uh,

3380
02:36:56,500 --> 02:36:59,530
was living as a woman,
but that might not be real.

3381
02:37:00,110 --> 02:37:02,230
Hmm.
He might just feel like we're in a dress

3382
02:37:02,231 --> 02:37:03,760
that day.
He said he answered,

3383
02:37:04,150 --> 02:37:06,700
you run 53 marathons,
whatever the fuck he did.

3384
02:37:06,701 --> 02:37:07,720
You can do whatever you want.
Dude.

3385
02:37:07,740 --> 02:37:12,550
Maybe his dick fell off this in 2016 and
then the first one was in 2009.

3386
02:37:12,640 --> 02:37:13,151
Ah,
okay.

3387
02:37:13,151 --> 02:37:15,920
That makes sense.
Because the 2009 one I think I found out

3388
02:37:15,921 --> 02:37:16,340
about

3389
02:37:16,340 --> 02:37:18,950
around 2012 or something like that,
I remember watching it,

3390
02:37:18,951 --> 02:37:19,784
thinking that's,
that's a kind of mental toughness that 

3391
02:37:26,001 --> 02:37:29,570
very few people have.
I don't think I have it to run that many

3392
02:37:29,571 --> 02:37:30,404
marathons.
And how many days you might have to 

3393
02:37:32,690 --> 02:37:36,680
force yourself into that too.
In the last day,

3394
02:37:36,830 --> 02:37:39,890
Jesus Christ,
what?

3395
02:37:39,950 --> 02:37:42,500
He ran a double marathon on the last 
day.

3396
02:37:42,590 --> 02:37:45,530
So that was the toughest day of my life.
Holy Shit,

3397
02:37:45,531 --> 02:37:46,364
dude.
If I've had to take off to go to the 

3398
02:37:47,301 --> 02:37:49,130
hospital,
so we had to make up one.

3399
02:37:49,190 --> 02:37:50,023
Oh my God.
He had to go to the hospital to get his 

3400
02:37:51,470 --> 02:37:52,303
kidneys checked out.
So on day 27 I ran my 26 and my 27th 

3401
02:37:55,941 --> 02:37:59,030
marathon double marathon on the last 
day.

3402
02:37:59,031 --> 02:38:01,670
So that was the toughest day of my life.
I'm telling you,

3403
02:38:01,671 --> 02:38:03,410
man,
that is not a regular person.

3404
02:38:03,560 --> 02:38:07,010
A guy who is not like a Cam Haynes type 
guy who's in shape,

3405
02:38:07,011 --> 02:38:10,160
who could just do like campaigns can run
a marathon a day and it's not hard.

3406
02:38:10,490 --> 02:38:11,323
Like if he no bullshit.
If he wanted to go and do 27 marathons 

3407
02:38:14,541 --> 02:38:15,770
in 27 days,
he'd be like,

3408
02:38:15,771 --> 02:38:16,910
yeah,
I've done that already.

3409
02:38:17,120 --> 02:38:19,040
He could just do it.
He can go do that.

3410
02:38:19,190 --> 02:38:22,550
But,
but Eddie Izzard was not,

3411
02:38:22,970 --> 02:38:25,880
he wasn't planning for that.
He liked,

3412
02:38:25,881 --> 02:38:29,390
he didn't get in shape before he did it.
Unless he did the second time,

3413
02:38:29,870 --> 02:38:33,410
I might be wrong about the second time.
The first time he did it,

3414
02:38:33,890 --> 02:38:34,723
he didn't get in shape for it.
And to see him run in those 27 

3415
02:38:37,641 --> 02:38:39,440
marathons,
it's just like,

3416
02:38:39,620 --> 02:38:42,740
it's all just mental toughness.
He just forced his body to keep moving.

3417
02:38:43,130 --> 02:38:45,560
What does it say here?
He's going into politics and 20,

3418
02:38:45,561 --> 02:38:46,341
20.
Oh Shit.

3419
02:38:46,341 --> 02:38:47,390
King of the world.
Eddie Izzard,

3420
02:38:47,840 --> 02:38:48,673
he maybe he's the first print 
transgender president if he decided to 

3421
02:38:52,611 --> 02:38:56,810
go for it to be born here and we fix 
that well,

3422
02:38:56,811 --> 02:38:57,644
president of where they live.
I also did all these marathons in South 

3423
02:39:01,070 --> 02:39:03,980
Africa where the weather was a bit 
hotter than it wouldn't be.

3424
02:39:04,370 --> 02:39:07,760
And listen to Dan were music duck and 
crocodiles.

3425
02:39:09,700 --> 02:39:10,533
Wow.

3426
02:39:11,190 --> 02:39:14,490
So he's going to go into a um,
yeah.

3427
02:39:14,500 --> 02:39:15,540
He,
his reasoning here,

3428
02:39:15,541 --> 02:39:16,770
he says,
that's why I pulled that up.

3429
02:39:17,100 --> 02:39:17,933
Wow.
So he's doing these races just to get 

3430
02:39:20,881 --> 02:39:22,800
people to pay attention to the messages 
behind.

3431
02:39:22,801 --> 02:39:24,840
He's not really into racing.
That's interesting.

3432
02:39:25,640 --> 02:39:26,473
Wow.

3433
02:39:29,230 --> 02:39:32,770
Interesting.
He's a very thoughtful guy and,

3434
02:39:32,800 --> 02:39:33,633
but what impressed me the most is not 
just like the words that he strings 

3435
02:39:36,731 --> 02:39:39,340
together and how he says things,
which is always impressive,

3436
02:39:39,910 --> 02:39:43,720
but someone who can do that,
like that is not normal.

3437
02:39:43,840 --> 02:39:47,290
That's extraordinary because he's,
he's,

3438
02:39:48,070 --> 02:39:51,190
it would be extraordinary for someone 
who's in great shape,

3439
02:39:51,700 --> 02:39:55,240
like a person who is like a um,
you know,

3440
02:39:55,241 --> 02:39:57,850
world class like that Courtney Dole,
Walter Lady,

3441
02:39:57,851 --> 02:40:02,620
if she ran 27 marathons in 27 days,
it would still be remarkably impressive.

3442
02:40:02,650 --> 02:40:03,483
It is just the amount of time that you 
have to spend running every day for 27 

3443
02:40:07,451 --> 02:40:09,010
days.
That shit is impressive.

3444
02:40:10,030 --> 02:40:11,140
That's just impressive.

3445
02:40:13,800 --> 02:40:14,633
But

3446
02:40:14,840 --> 02:40:19,550
to do it when you're just a guy who's a 
comic and did not even in shape,

3447
02:40:19,610 --> 02:40:21,590
he wasn't even,
he wasn't even thin.

3448
02:40:21,650 --> 02:40:23,600
You have like,
like a bit of a belly,

3449
02:40:24,990 --> 02:40:26,990
but he wasn't lean by any stretch of the
imagination.

3450
02:40:26,991 --> 02:40:29,490
It didn't look like a runner.
Does he still do comedy?

3451
02:40:30,030 --> 02:40:30,863
I don't know man.
I feel like I haven't seen or heard 

3452
02:40:33,151 --> 02:40:34,840
about him in a long time.
I think we'll,

3453
02:40:34,920 --> 02:40:35,753
we're guilty over here of not paying 
attention to what happens in comedy 

3454
02:40:37,640 --> 02:40:39,020
anywhere else in the world.
You know,

3455
02:40:39,021 --> 02:40:39,854
I,
I had somebody has to like beat me over 

3456
02:40:40,681 --> 02:40:41,514
the head with somebody that's really 
funny from somewhere else for me to pay 

3457
02:40:42,871 --> 02:40:43,704
attention.
I just saw that they have roast battle 

3458
02:40:45,391 --> 02:40:47,750
now and in UK.
Here he goes,

3459
02:40:47,910 --> 02:40:51,450
Eddie izzard believe me tour.
Not that it matters,

3460
02:40:51,451 --> 02:40:53,430
but find out if he's a woman.
She in French.

3461
02:40:53,940 --> 02:40:56,730
Whoa.
Of course he's a genius.

3462
02:40:56,760 --> 02:40:59,790
Fuck guys doing shows in French.
The show was in French.

3463
02:40:59,791 --> 02:41:01,020
Just shows in French.
It's sows.

3464
02:41:01,800 --> 02:41:02,633
Fuck man.
I'm gonna go there with those Google 

3465
02:41:04,440 --> 02:41:05,273
Pixel headsets.

3466
02:41:06,640 --> 02:41:08,400
It's all he stuff.
Yeah,

3467
02:41:08,401 --> 02:41:09,210
man.
That's,

3468
02:41:09,210 --> 02:41:10,340
that's where,
uh,

3469
02:41:10,440 --> 02:41:13,380
originally I got the idea of us being 
able to communicate with plants.

3470
02:41:13,740 --> 02:41:17,090
I figured this is step one.
Step one is the Google Pixel earbuds.

3471
02:41:17,091 --> 02:41:17,924
It let you listen to someone speak 
Spanish and real time translate it to 

3472
02:41:19,981 --> 02:41:22,650
English.
Step two is they figure out some sort of

3473
02:41:22,651 --> 02:41:23,484
a universal code that the plant world is
willing to accept and we start 

3474
02:41:26,551 --> 02:41:28,530
communicating back and forth to the 
plant world.

3475
02:41:28,710 --> 02:41:30,960
Step three,
they develop a headset,

3476
02:41:30,961 --> 02:41:33,810
some sort of a neural interface with a 
human being.

3477
02:41:33,811 --> 02:41:34,644
When they put this thing on and you go 
out into the forest and you communicate 

3478
02:41:36,691 --> 02:41:39,060
with the trees,
that's frequency.

3479
02:41:39,120 --> 02:41:42,040
I say that hundred percent.
Why Not Joe?

3480
02:41:42,150 --> 02:41:45,120
I have to do is get them to obviously 
communicating with themselves.

3481
02:41:45,510 --> 02:41:47,610
There's some form of communication 
between plants.

3482
02:41:47,611 --> 02:41:50,340
This has been proven cause a bunch of 
weird shit they do.

3483
02:41:50,340 --> 02:41:53,940
Like they changed the way they taste 
based on whether or not they hear things

3484
02:41:53,941 --> 02:41:54,774
going on in the distance that he or 
someone eating them in the distance and 

3485
02:41:57,331 --> 02:41:58,164
they'll change the way they taste.
They catch things down wind like the 

3486
02:42:00,601 --> 02:42:01,434
smell of them getting consumed by 
another animal will change the way they 

3487
02:42:04,081 --> 02:42:05,940
test.
Like that was the case.

3488
02:42:05,941 --> 02:42:06,630
What the,
uh,

3489
02:42:06,630 --> 02:42:07,463
Keisha Bush and giraffes,
they found that giraffes that we're 

3490
02:42:10,381 --> 02:42:12,630
eating these Acacia Bushes,
uh,

3491
02:42:12,840 --> 02:42:15,210
upwind.
Upwind when it's downwind,

3492
02:42:15,240 --> 02:42:16,290
yeah,
down upwind.

3493
02:42:16,500 --> 02:42:17,333
When they would eat them,
the smell of them consuming them would 

3494
02:42:20,131 --> 02:42:24,600
come down when and it would change the 
flavor profile of all these other trees.

3495
02:42:24,810 --> 02:42:27,900
They would turn nasty tasting to avoid 
the giraffes from eating them.

3496
02:42:28,030 --> 02:42:30,420
Hmm.
That's crazy dude.

3497
02:42:30,540 --> 02:42:31,373
So then,
then they figured out that they could 

3498
02:42:32,461 --> 02:42:33,294
play the sound of caterpillars munching 
leaves right next to the tree and it 

3499
02:42:39,061 --> 02:42:41,550
would have the same effect.
Wow.

3500
02:42:41,970 --> 02:42:42,840
Yeah.
So

3501
02:42:44,070 --> 02:42:44,903
somehow or another,
they know what it sounds like when 

3502
02:42:46,351 --> 02:42:48,510
they're eating.
I don't know if they try everything like

3503
02:42:48,511 --> 02:42:53,340
we're going to have sex with this tree 
and just see what happens or vertical.

3504
02:42:53,341 --> 02:42:54,174
The tree vegans are super not happy 
about plants being alive and thinking 

3505
02:42:57,730 --> 02:42:59,310
you bring it up,
they get so triggered.

3506
02:42:59,600 --> 02:43:00,433
It is one of the most triggering things.
His plant intelligence research they 

3507
02:43:03,571 --> 02:43:05,670
cause they want to claim moral 
superiority.

3508
02:43:05,970 --> 02:43:07,320
They want to claim that,
you know La,

3509
02:43:07,321 --> 02:43:07,771
la,
la,

3510
02:43:07,771 --> 02:43:08,604
I can't hear the plant.
There's that cabbage is screaming when 

3511
02:43:11,171 --> 02:43:14,500
you pull it out of the ground,
you fuck screaming for its family.

3512
02:43:14,501 --> 02:43:19,501
The interconnectedness with the mycelium
and the soil just beautiful.

3513
02:43:20,440 --> 02:43:21,490
Yeah,
that,

3514
02:43:21,610 --> 02:43:22,443
but I think what's going to fix veganism
honestly is that a robot meet that that 

3515
02:43:28,120 --> 02:43:30,790
artificial lab created meat.
I was going to fix it.

3516
02:43:31,150 --> 02:43:31,983
People are gonna realize like,
Yo all just healthier this way he body 

3517
02:43:34,450 --> 02:43:36,400
has more vitality.
It's going to be extinct,

3518
02:43:37,180 --> 02:43:39,310
veganism is going to be extinct in the 
future.

3519
02:43:39,580 --> 02:43:41,920
As soon as they come up with super 
ethical meat,

3520
02:43:42,070 --> 02:43:44,790
there's going to be no reason for it.
Everybody's going to go watch too.

3521
02:43:44,800 --> 02:43:46,330
And I feel so much better when I eat 
steak.

3522
02:43:47,860 --> 02:43:52,860
It's just fuck like it's,
it's,

3523
02:43:53,590 --> 02:43:56,590
there's obviously a reason why we're 
having all this debate.

3524
02:43:56,591 --> 02:43:58,570
It's not like it's crystal clear one way
or another.

3525
02:43:58,600 --> 02:44:01,360
It's like it's not good that an animal 
die so that you'll live.

3526
02:44:01,390 --> 02:44:03,040
That's not good.
That doesn't feel good,

3527
02:44:03,280 --> 02:44:05,260
but it's not good if they get over 
populated either.

3528
02:44:05,740 --> 02:44:06,940
Again,
that's not good either.

3529
02:44:07,510 --> 02:44:08,343
You know,
it was what I was reading this thing 

3530
02:44:08,801 --> 02:44:09,640
about,
um,

3531
02:44:09,880 --> 02:44:12,610
there's an animal called an hour dad.
It's like a sheep.

3532
02:44:13,570 --> 02:44:15,310
And um,
they,

3533
02:44:15,311 --> 02:44:16,144
uh,
imported them to Texas a long time ago 

3534
02:44:19,301 --> 02:44:22,750
and they don't taste good to eat 
apparently.

3535
02:44:23,110 --> 02:44:24,970
Or maybe a lot of people were eating in 
the wrong way.

3536
02:44:25,270 --> 02:44:27,460
So because of that,
they don't hunt them a lot.

3537
02:44:27,850 --> 02:44:28,683
Or if they do hunt them,
it's not like the same way they hunt 

3538
02:44:29,861 --> 02:44:33,640
whitetail deer or something like that.
And they live in these like difficult to

3539
02:44:33,641 --> 02:44:36,250
get to remote parts of like West Texas 
and shit.

3540
02:44:36,610 --> 02:44:37,443
And so then some of them,
the ranchers have taken to like firing 

3541
02:44:41,560 --> 02:44:43,570
guns out of helicopters to get rid of 
him.

3542
02:44:44,080 --> 02:44:48,230
Like this is crazy.
Like you have animals that you're,

3543
02:44:48,231 --> 02:44:51,800
you're hunting with helicopters that you
brought over here from another place,

3544
02:44:52,100 --> 02:44:54,920
but they look like,
just like they're cool looking man.

3545
02:44:55,190 --> 02:44:56,990
They look like some sort of a star wars 
type

3546
02:44:58,630 --> 02:45:01,000
goat creature,
sheep creature.

3547
02:45:01,030 --> 02:45:04,990
They have the amazing horns.
There was enormous horns,

3548
02:45:05,140 --> 02:45:07,720
but apparently they just can't figure 
out a way to make them taste good.

3549
02:45:08,260 --> 02:45:10,480
This is from everybody that I know 
that's tried to eat them,

3550
02:45:10,720 --> 02:45:12,190
give it to an Asian now,
figure it out.

3551
02:45:12,940 --> 02:45:13,773
It's probably a good call.
I wonder if there must be somebody that 

3552
02:45:15,941 --> 02:45:17,650
thinks they taste good and knows the 
dude,

3553
02:45:17,680 --> 02:45:19,360
but pull up a picture of an hour.
Dad,

3554
02:45:19,361 --> 02:45:20,194
sheep.
It's like,

3555
02:45:20,950 --> 02:45:22,620
will you look for,
I haven't.

3556
02:45:22,621 --> 02:45:24,280
I'll Wafi sheep.
No,

3557
02:45:24,281 --> 02:45:24,761
no.
It's like,

3558
02:45:24,761 --> 02:45:28,210
it's called Aoudad.
They're like one of the few animals that

3559
02:45:28,211 --> 02:45:30,280
are like universally thought to tastes 
like shit.

3560
02:45:30,460 --> 02:45:32,020
Wow.
From people that hunt them,

3561
02:45:32,021 --> 02:45:34,120
but they're here and they have to 
control their population.

3562
02:45:34,121 --> 02:45:37,120
So what do you do about them?
What do you do about wild pigs?

3563
02:45:37,121 --> 02:45:40,150
We did do about animals to get to the,
unless you want to let predators loose.

3564
02:45:40,180 --> 02:45:42,130
That's it right there.
That picture.

3565
02:45:42,400 --> 02:45:43,300
Oh,
that's a stone sheep.

3566
02:45:43,600 --> 02:45:44,111
No,
I'm,

3567
02:45:44,111 --> 02:45:45,610
it's our dad.
It's like,

3568
02:45:46,720 --> 02:45:51,720
how'd you spell it out of you a dad?
I only have a picture of those fuckers.

3569
02:45:53,120 --> 02:45:55,270
Um,
Aoudad Hunt Texas,

3570
02:45:55,750 --> 02:45:58,450
but type in that because they're very 
popular to hunting in Texas,

3571
02:45:59,200 --> 02:46:02,890
but I don't think a lot of people will.
Our debt hunt Texas.

3572
02:46:03,530 --> 02:46:07,390
Yeah,
those are um,

3573
02:46:07,480 --> 02:46:09,980
dear.
That's not the same thing about

3574
02:46:09,980 --> 02:46:11,090
that.
How do you spell that?

3575
02:46:11,091 --> 02:46:13,960
Our Dad word out.
None of these things are the Aoudad.

3576
02:46:14,210 --> 02:46:16,130
How would that is like big,
thick,

3577
02:46:16,280 --> 02:46:17,113
um,
horns say it to Siri and see what she 

3578
02:46:20,690 --> 02:46:22,430
comes up with?
Well,

3579
02:46:22,610 --> 02:46:24,950
either way I'll find it.
Um,

3580
02:46:25,690 --> 02:46:27,710
what,
what would you do with all the,

3581
02:46:27,890 --> 02:46:31,610
if we did figure out a way to never have
an animal suffer again,

3582
02:46:31,611 --> 02:46:32,444
but we could all eat meat,
what would you do with all the animals 

3583
02:46:34,341 --> 02:46:36,740
that existed?
That would be a giant dilemma.

3584
02:46:37,250 --> 02:46:38,720
Like how many people would say,
yeah,

3585
02:46:38,721 --> 02:46:40,130
you know what,
that's all well and good,

3586
02:46:40,131 --> 02:46:43,100
but I want a cow that just got killed.
I want a real cow.

3587
02:46:43,160 --> 02:46:45,860
It's really alive.
It makes me think and feel better.

3588
02:46:47,480 --> 02:46:49,700
Would have to add.
Is that it?

3589
02:46:49,780 --> 02:46:50,630
No,
that was the closest.

3590
02:46:50,631 --> 02:46:51,464
Some else [inaudible] that's some sort 
of feral sheep all Parra that's weird 

3591
02:46:55,541 --> 02:46:56,690
that they don't have Alad Dad.

3592
02:46:57,410 --> 02:47:02,210
Maybe try a different spelling.
Aoudad sheep hunt Texas.

3593
02:47:03,620 --> 02:47:05,150
Anyway.
Um,

3594
02:47:06,690 --> 02:47:09,170
the delicate balance of like prey and 
Predator.

3595
02:47:09,171 --> 02:47:10,004
Like how do you manage that if you have 
certain populations of these animals 

3596
02:47:13,851 --> 02:47:15,800
just running loose?
Somebody sent me a video.

3597
02:47:15,860 --> 02:47:17,320
That's it.
I just took the word off.

3598
02:47:17,321 --> 02:47:19,850
It just that she texted.
Go back to that last one you had.

3599
02:47:19,940 --> 02:47:21,620
That's exactly what it looks like.
Hmm.

3600
02:47:21,710 --> 02:47:23,240
Look at that thing.
It looks like the devil.

3601
02:47:24,080 --> 02:47:25,250
Right?
Those horns.

3602
02:47:25,310 --> 02:47:26,990
That's like some sate and shit from 
Damien.

3603
02:47:28,310 --> 02:47:30,100
It's weird that meat is not just meet 
that.

3604
02:47:30,101 --> 02:47:33,110
Like he can't just like take that leg 
off and eat it.

3605
02:47:33,530 --> 02:47:35,360
Nope.
It's definitely different.

3606
02:47:35,361 --> 02:47:36,194
Some people say a goat is delicious,
but I think it really depends upon the 

3607
02:47:39,651 --> 02:47:41,570
diet of the goat.
And some goats,

3608
02:47:41,630 --> 02:47:45,050
they eat weird shit and they taste 
terrible and some,

3609
02:47:45,080 --> 02:47:46,610
some goats they eat,
you know,

3610
02:47:46,611 --> 02:47:48,380
mmm delicious plants and you eat them.

3611
02:47:48,380 --> 02:47:50,420
And I bet it tastes as good as anything 
you're ever going to eat.

3612
02:47:50,720 --> 02:47:51,553
It really did.
It varies so much between the people 

3613
02:47:53,241 --> 02:47:55,730
that say it tastes amazing versus the 
people that say it tastes terrible.

3614
02:47:55,790 --> 02:47:56,623
That's a perfect example of one.
I mean that looks like something from 

3615
02:47:58,371 --> 02:47:59,470
Star Wars.
Well,

3616
02:47:59,590 --> 02:48:03,740
you could say that it's crazy looking,
but what would you do?

3617
02:48:03,860 --> 02:48:04,693
So if we did figure out a way to have 
all of our meat come out of a 

3618
02:48:08,631 --> 02:48:10,520
laboratory,
so nothing has to die.

3619
02:48:11,570 --> 02:48:14,220
What do we do about all the animals?
Zoo Zoo.

3620
02:48:15,560 --> 02:48:17,750
That's not right.
That's even crazier.

3621
02:48:17,840 --> 02:48:22,840
Like did not have a ranch instead of a 
zoo animal island do.

3622
02:48:23,211 --> 02:48:24,770
That's it.
That's the island we were talking about.

3623
02:48:25,010 --> 02:48:25,843
We ship all the animals to like some 
giant like New Zealand and make a deal 

3624
02:48:29,381 --> 02:48:30,980
with New Zealand.
We're going to bring home with lions,

3625
02:48:30,981 --> 02:48:31,814
Bro,
but with no predators to net deck 

3626
02:48:33,950 --> 02:48:35,060
drastic park basically.

3627
02:48:35,090 --> 02:48:35,990
Yeah,
exactly.

3628
02:48:36,500 --> 02:48:39,470
Yeah.
You'd have to bring over predators to,

3629
02:48:39,650 --> 02:48:40,483
you'd have to create a wild ecosystem.
Just a fully wild ecosystem and just 

3630
02:48:45,080 --> 02:48:45,913
everybody else.
There's so many people by the year 2099 

3631
02:48:48,350 --> 02:48:49,183
that we have occupied every single 
stretch of the world and everything 

3632
02:48:53,541 --> 02:48:56,090
looks like New York City except one 
continent,

3633
02:48:56,091 --> 02:48:57,860
which is like central park for the 
world.

3634
02:48:58,130 --> 02:49:03,130
So the world is now one enormous city,
but we've maintained like the Amazon,

3635
02:49:03,470 --> 02:49:05,240
the Amazon rain forest is what we 
cherish.

3636
02:49:05,241 --> 02:49:06,680
That's our last connection to mother 
earth.

3637
02:49:06,681 --> 02:49:11,310
Before we slip in to some symbiotic 
relationship with computers,

3638
02:49:11,420 --> 02:49:12,120
Don,
Don,

3639
02:49:12,120 --> 02:49:12,953
Don,
we're allowed to visit this island in 

3640
02:49:14,701 --> 02:49:16,200
little hamster ball.
So yeah,

3641
02:49:16,290 --> 02:49:17,490
dude,
just like Jurassic Park,

3642
02:49:18,090 --> 02:49:20,040
this could be real.
It could be real.

3643
02:49:20,041 --> 02:49:22,230
I mean this literally,
it sounds crazy,

3644
02:49:22,470 --> 02:49:24,600
but if you're talking about 500 years 
from now,

3645
02:49:24,660 --> 02:49:25,493
we literally could have occupied every 
single part of the earth except for one 

3646
02:49:29,581 --> 02:49:29,850
place.

3647
02:49:29,850 --> 02:49:32,160
We literally could make some sort of a 
deal.

3648
02:49:32,610 --> 02:49:34,020
They'll like when nobody goes to the 
Amazon,

3649
02:49:34,470 --> 02:49:35,880
thinks you'd be a great science fiction 
movie.

3650
02:49:35,910 --> 02:49:37,140
Feel free to steal it,
steal it,

3651
02:49:37,650 --> 02:49:38,483
dark mirror.
I think we need to start building 

3652
02:49:39,421 --> 02:49:43,520
underwater,
underwater cities that she imagined.

3653
02:49:43,530 --> 02:49:46,170
You're underwater.
We'll see a little crack in the wall and

3654
02:49:46,260 --> 02:49:48,630
you're coming home and you're on edibles
and you're so tired,

3655
02:49:48,631 --> 02:49:52,080
but you have to be at work at three 
hours and you look and you see a little,

3656
02:49:52,230 --> 02:49:54,570
just a small crack in the world and you 
go,

3657
02:49:54,571 --> 02:49:58,290
do I talk about this crack I taught?
Maybe it's just a flaw in the glass.

3658
02:49:58,310 --> 02:50:00,480
It just looks like a crack and then as 
you're,

3659
02:50:00,481 --> 02:50:02,400
as you're going back home at the end of 
your shift,

3660
02:50:02,430 --> 02:50:04,440
it looks just a little bigger.
She,

3661
02:50:04,441 --> 02:50:08,040
I'd rather did this and the Mars,
I trust underwater cracks.

3662
02:50:08,040 --> 02:50:10,590
Marlon going in a tesla,
the Mars,

3663
02:50:10,740 --> 02:50:11,573
just the feeling of all the walls 
exploding instantaneously and billions 

3664
02:50:18,180 --> 02:50:23,160
of gallons of ocean water crushing your 
very existence instantaneously.

3665
02:50:23,240 --> 02:50:23,940
Sober,
chill,

3666
02:50:23,940 --> 02:50:27,990
boom.
Just a smash of the ocean,

3667
02:50:28,620 --> 02:50:32,160
hundred feet deep around you crushing 
everything.

3668
02:50:32,370 --> 02:50:36,420
As soon as that crack gets big enough,
I'm freaking me out.

3669
02:50:37,830 --> 02:50:39,480
So you would do Mars?
No,

3670
02:50:39,481 --> 02:50:40,950
I want and I'm not doing anyone any of 
that.

3671
02:50:41,220 --> 02:50:43,320
Fuck themselves.
I even getting submarine.

3672
02:50:43,590 --> 02:50:44,790
Nope,
no desire.

3673
02:50:45,170 --> 02:50:47,140
I want to see Nimo at Walt Disney 
though.

3674
02:50:47,141 --> 02:50:52,141
It was a fun rog.
Great for Little Kids Finding Nemo.

3675
02:50:52,470 --> 02:50:55,290
You go out in the little submarine and 
they have a little show they do for you.

3676
02:50:55,320 --> 02:50:57,630
It's wonderful.
That's about as good as it gets.

3677
02:50:58,800 --> 02:50:59,633
How about that one lady who was a 
reporter who went in the guy submarine 

3678
02:51:02,700 --> 02:51:05,970
and he killed her and chopped her up to 
capitate at her like,

3679
02:51:05,971 --> 02:51:06,804
what the fuck he imagine if you're a 
lady and you go out there and you're 

3680
02:51:10,141 --> 02:51:10,974
looking to do a story about a guy who 
made his own submarine and then 

3681
02:51:13,681 --> 02:51:14,514
somewhere along the line he kills you 
and chops you up and throws in the 

3682
02:51:17,821 --> 02:51:18,090
ocean.

3683
02:51:18,090 --> 02:51:18,923
You got to think like when you're going 
to visit interview a guy who made a 

3684
02:51:20,921 --> 02:51:21,754
submarine,
there's no way this guy's gonna chop me 

3685
02:51:22,471 --> 02:51:24,540
up.
That's not going to happen.

3686
02:51:24,690 --> 02:51:27,750
He knows that everybody knows I'm going 
to visit him.

3687
02:51:28,200 --> 02:51:30,960
I kinda believe his excuse a little,
but then I,

3688
02:51:31,290 --> 02:51:34,470
you know that where the hatch just 
closed on her head.

3689
02:51:34,560 --> 02:51:36,570
Yeah,
but you're supposed to tell people that,

3690
02:51:36,620 --> 02:51:37,453
you know,
it's supposed to chop her up and throw 

3691
02:51:38,040 --> 02:51:40,100
in the ocean and pretend nothing 
happened to them.

3692
02:51:40,430 --> 02:51:41,263
Did you just tell everybody who's a 
horrific accident and you feel terrible 

3693
02:51:44,191 --> 02:51:49,191
and you get punished and fuck man,
poor lady.

3694
02:51:49,530 --> 02:51:50,363
11 days to think about it though.
He had 11 days sort of reading it right 

3695
02:51:54,151 --> 02:51:56,240
now as you guys were saying it,
uh,

3696
02:51:56,280 --> 02:51:59,040
her for her torso is found 11 days 
later.

3697
02:51:59,370 --> 02:52:02,400
Well first he said she died of carbon 
monoxide poisoning.

3698
02:52:03,270 --> 02:52:05,950
It previously had said the thing hit 
her,

3699
02:52:05,951 --> 02:52:08,200
hit her head.
It was 150 pound hatch door.

3700
02:52:08,290 --> 02:52:09,820
Oh,
Jesus Christ.

3701
02:52:09,910 --> 02:52:11,920
Did you imagine that?
Oh my God,

3702
02:52:12,670 --> 02:52:13,503
that makes sense.
Hatch door hitting your head makes 

3703
02:52:15,341 --> 02:52:17,200
sense.
But either way,

3704
02:52:17,201 --> 02:52:20,170
fuck submarines.
Do Fuck submarines.

3705
02:52:20,630 --> 02:52:21,463
Right?
Do you have any desire to go bungee 

3706
02:52:23,171 --> 02:52:24,220
jumping?
Nope.

3707
02:52:24,250 --> 02:52:25,870
Good for you.
So I'm scared of heights.

3708
02:52:25,930 --> 02:52:28,090
I don't want any of that.
Fuck all that right.

3709
02:52:28,390 --> 02:52:30,430
The squirrel suit doesn't sound 
terribly.

3710
02:52:30,480 --> 02:52:31,690
What?
It sounds kind of fun.

3711
02:52:31,720 --> 02:52:33,310
You did the squirrel so I wouldn't do 
it.

3712
02:52:33,311 --> 02:52:34,760
It sounds fun.
Flashy.

3713
02:52:34,761 --> 02:52:35,594
You.
Um,

3714
02:52:35,650 --> 02:52:40,480
let me know when you can do that so I 
can prepare for your absence forever.

3715
02:52:41,250 --> 02:52:44,470
Going to be anytime soon.
Life insurance policy on the stump.

3716
02:52:44,471 --> 02:52:46,120
Fucking call you to clock in the 
morning.

3717
02:52:46,450 --> 02:52:48,670
I'll lit up,
try to get you to jump off the Alps.

3718
02:52:48,700 --> 02:52:50,350
But if he ever gets a suit with some 
jets on it,

3719
02:52:50,410 --> 02:52:51,190
I might be.

3720
02:52:51,190 --> 02:52:52,023
What if that goes wrong?
What if that's like the tesla door 

3721
02:52:53,561 --> 02:52:56,140
handles it one open up.
So come on man,

3722
02:52:56,470 --> 02:52:58,720
don't do it man.
You want to parasail anymore?

3723
02:52:59,590 --> 02:53:01,750
Yeah,
but hang gliding is,

3724
02:53:01,751 --> 02:53:02,584
I've heard of people like getting shot 
up in a hang glider 300 feet and just a 

3725
02:53:05,441 --> 02:53:06,274
little like spout of air that they can't
control and you're fucked on that phone 

3726
02:53:09,730 --> 02:53:11,830
call that we're crazy.
Yeah.

3727
02:53:12,280 --> 02:53:13,113
This is all that for thrills,
for wild thrills and God dammit we're 

3728
02:53:18,401 --> 02:53:19,234
going to have flying cars though.
That's no the thing they're looking 

3729
02:53:21,191 --> 02:53:22,024
into,
there's a lot of people that are 

3730
02:53:22,481 --> 02:53:24,610
seriously considering flying cars right 
now.

3731
02:53:24,790 --> 02:53:26,710
I think it's a matter of time before 
they locked that down.

3732
02:53:26,860 --> 02:53:27,693
I think it's going to be automated 
pilots or mean driverless cars first in 

3733
02:53:31,601 --> 02:53:33,160
that technology.
Then flying,

3734
02:53:33,161 --> 02:53:33,994
I think you're totally right and I think
they're going to have the same sort of 

3735
02:53:35,621 --> 02:53:39,580
like lane departure warnings and all the
stuff that like keeps cars from crashing

3736
02:53:39,581 --> 02:53:40,414
into each other,
the correct and that people are just 

3737
02:53:41,861 --> 02:53:42,341
going to say,
well,

3738
02:53:42,341 --> 02:53:43,174
as long as they're autonomous,
it actually makes it more efficient to 

3739
02:53:45,551 --> 02:53:48,550
use the entire three d space and not 
have the,

3740
02:53:48,850 --> 02:53:51,760
the landscape marred with all these hard
roads.

3741
02:53:54,680 --> 02:53:56,820
I haven't been a bummer today have,
I feel like I'm freaking out.

3742
02:53:57,670 --> 02:53:58,503
I'm freaking me out.
I don't know why I'm more serious about 

3743
02:54:01,241 --> 02:54:04,480
this shit heading into 2018 but it just 
seems ominous.

3744
02:54:05,170 --> 02:54:05,921
Dom,
dom,

3745
02:54:05,921 --> 02:54:07,360
dom.
All right.

3746
02:54:07,361 --> 02:54:09,130
I gotta pee so bad.
We have to wrap this up.

3747
02:54:09,700 --> 02:54:10,970
I've been holding it in.
Yeah.

3748
02:54:12,040 --> 02:54:15,430
I drank too much coffee before this one.
It's almost three hours.

3749
02:54:15,570 --> 02:54:16,510
Yeah,
almost three hours.

3750
02:54:16,540 --> 02:54:17,440
All right.
Brian Redman,

3751
02:54:17,770 --> 02:54:21,430
tell everybody where you are and how can
everybody mock Tony Hinchcliffe they can

3752
02:54:21,760 --> 02:54:24,130
contact him at Tony Hinchcliffe on 
twitter.

3753
02:54:24,160 --> 02:54:24,861
Yeah,
that's right.

3754
02:54:24,861 --> 02:54:25,694
Give Jeremiah Watkins some love and 
we'll be doing his stand up on the spot 

3755
02:54:28,241 --> 02:54:29,051

formerly of Beltour.

3765
02:54:58,570 --> 02:54:59,810
He's here now.
Oh Bye.

3766
02:55:02,000 --> 02:55:07,000
[inaudible].
