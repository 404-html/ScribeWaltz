1
00:00:08,920 --> 00:00:12,700
Greg,
out of the gate with that,

2
00:00:12,710 --> 00:00:14,080
that's what I can.
Or Gas.

3
00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:16,380
Yes.

4
00:00:19,620 --> 00:00:22,680
That's donald trump's face.
You ever seen notice that donald trump's

5
00:00:22,681 --> 00:00:23,730
face is running away from it?

6
00:00:24,820 --> 00:00:28,630
He looks like he needs vaginal 
rejuvenation surgery on his cheeks.

7
00:00:30,010 --> 00:00:33,700
What happens to a person's face that it 
just doesn't like their head anymore?

8
00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:37,240
Just pulling away.
Yours is hanging in,

9
00:00:38,010 --> 00:00:40,180
but his.
He's not that fat now.

10
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:45,240
You know what I mean?
Like Chris Christie's faces in better 

11
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:45,240
shape than his.
Well being.

12
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:48,160
Fat helps because yeah,
pushes all the wrinkles out.

13
00:00:48,161 --> 00:00:50,170
You get no wrinkles when you're fat,
but mine,

14
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:52,030
I'm Irish.
When you're Irish,

15
00:00:52,031 --> 00:00:57,031
man,
you hit 40 and all of a sudden a fucky 

16
00:00:57,031 --> 00:00:59,461
turning on like a rotten apple core.
All the meat falls off the bones and 

17
00:00:59,461 --> 00:01:01,030
your your cheeks slink in and

18
00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:04,330
they're close to a fix for that.
Really?

19
00:01:04,900 --> 00:01:05,910
Yeah.
They're real close.

20
00:01:06,210 --> 00:01:09,300
They're close to this guy.
I think his name is Peter was Dr.

21
00:01:09,390 --> 00:01:10,140
Peter,
welling,

22
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:13,020
whatever the doctor's name that invented
Regena gene,

23
00:01:13,170 --> 00:01:16,200
which is the blood spinning procedure 
that coby Brian,

24
00:01:16,201 --> 00:01:21,201
all these athletes going for,
he's invented some way to rejuvenate 

25
00:01:21,201 --> 00:01:25,221
your body's production of Collagen.
Going to shoot it into old ladies and 

26
00:01:25,221 --> 00:01:25,560
they going gonna look hot again.

27
00:01:26,930 --> 00:01:28,500
I'd be all over that shit.

28
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:30,120
That is.
That's what makes you wrinkle.

29
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:31,480
That's it.
Makes your skin loses.

30
00:01:31,530 --> 00:01:35,240
The last disability is Collagen and you 
know,

31
00:01:35,670 --> 00:01:37,740
if you look at like if you go to the 
gym,

32
00:01:37,770 --> 00:01:38,430
you go to the gym,
right?

33
00:01:38,570 --> 00:01:43,570
Hell yeah.
You ever do you have like one of those 

34
00:01:43,570 --> 00:01:45,360
older ladies at the gym where you like,
I fucking smash that.

35
00:01:45,390 --> 00:01:49,110
Some lady that's in her fifties,
but she's just doing squats every day.

36
00:01:49,111 --> 00:01:52,590
Just hanging on like that.
You know that kitten in that.

37
00:01:52,591 --> 00:01:57,591
A poster hanging in there,
baby hurting,

38
00:01:59,900 --> 00:02:02,440
right?
She is not going softly into that night.

39
00:02:02,450 --> 00:02:03,730
That's right now.
Then when you're,

40
00:02:03,731 --> 00:02:08,731
when you're 23 and you're in shape,
you can get out of shape for a few 

41
00:02:08,770 --> 00:02:11,560
months and then jumped right back into 
shaping and when you're.

42
00:02:11,561 --> 00:02:13,840
When you're hang on kitty,
you take,

43
00:02:13,870 --> 00:02:18,870
you take a week off,
you almost won't get back to where you 

44
00:02:18,870 --> 00:02:18,870
started again.
That's one of them.

45
00:02:18,870 --> 00:02:19,880
Yeah.
Yeah.

46
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:25,760
This picture,
we're looking at a cute little kitten 

47
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:25,760
hanging from a stick.
When you,

48
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:30,441
when you get to be like that age,
getting out of shape is really easy and 

49
00:02:30,441 --> 00:02:32,790
getting back into shape is fucking 
nightmarish.

50
00:02:32,791 --> 00:02:34,710
The first day back you're like,
Whoa,

51
00:02:34,730 --> 00:02:35,920
yeah,
I am.

52
00:02:35,950 --> 00:02:36,440
Oh,

53
00:02:36,700 --> 00:02:38,820
I went to do pushups today.
And uh,

54
00:02:38,830 --> 00:02:41,620
I used to be able to bang out 50 
pushups.

55
00:02:41,621 --> 00:02:43,180
No,
because I'm skinny as shit.

56
00:02:43,510 --> 00:02:45,790
And I did gymnastics my whole my whole 
life.

57
00:02:45,791 --> 00:02:50,050
And so I just had good,
like muscle to weight ratio.

58
00:02:50,710 --> 00:02:54,310
I fucking struggled to do 15.
I was shaking.

59
00:02:54,311 --> 00:02:55,660
I was like,
what the fuck?

60
00:02:55,661 --> 00:02:57,520
Just,
it really bummed me out.

61
00:02:57,521 --> 00:02:58,300
I was like,
wow.

62
00:02:58,301 --> 00:03:00,160
Because I said to,
to get back

63
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:05,160
to where I was would require a lot of 
uncomfortable pain over a long period of

64
00:03:05,291 --> 00:03:10,291
time.
Didn't you have like a real shoulder 

65
00:03:10,291 --> 00:03:10,291
injury or something?
Yeah,

66
00:03:10,291 --> 00:03:13,080
I get surgery.
What was wrong with your shoulder to 

67
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:13,930
cartilage can just wear out sometimes in
between your,

68
00:03:13,931 --> 00:03:14,950
uh,
your,

69
00:03:14,951 --> 00:03:17,380
there's three bones that come together 
and your shoulder,

70
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:19,930
clavicle and the whatever the other two 
are.

71
00:03:20,230 --> 00:03:25,230
And uh,
so they basically go in and in two 

72
00:03:25,230 --> 00:03:27,100
different spots,
they go into your shoulder and they just

73
00:03:27,101 --> 00:03:32,101
saw away the tips of the bones and then 
scar tissue forms on each bone and it 

74
00:03:33,551 --> 00:03:36,250
acts as a new cartilage.
And you know what?

75
00:03:36,610 --> 00:03:39,190
Fucking arm is good as no.
Unbelievable.

76
00:03:39,730 --> 00:03:41,170
Yeah.
Wow.

77
00:03:41,650 --> 00:03:46,650
Range.
Everything was great other than getting 

78
00:03:46,650 --> 00:03:46,650
hooked on Vicodin and everything about 
it was very positive.

79
00:03:46,650 --> 00:03:47,860
How long has it hooked on Viking?
Nine months.

80
00:03:47,980 --> 00:03:52,980
Whoa.
It's unbelievable how many doctors will 

81
00:03:52,980 --> 00:03:54,790
prescribe you like it.
And if you ask a surgeon,

82
00:03:54,820 --> 00:03:56,290
the surgeon,
the,

83
00:03:56,291 --> 00:03:58,210
uh,
primary care physician,

84
00:03:58,450 --> 00:04:03,450
the physical therapists,
and then I go to a psychopharmacologist 

85
00:04:03,450 --> 00:04:06,190
for my other little mood needs and I 
don't know why.

86
00:04:06,191 --> 00:04:09,490
This motherfucker.
I started writing scripts for pain.

87
00:04:09,580 --> 00:04:12,790
Then he got friends.
Every friends got a medicine cabinet.

88
00:04:12,791 --> 00:04:16,720
Joe Rogan.
Let me make an announcement right now.

89
00:04:16,721 --> 00:04:21,340
If you're a friend of mine and you had 
me over in 2013,

90
00:04:21,790 --> 00:04:23,340
you may want to restock your,
uh,

91
00:04:24,580 --> 00:04:29,580
your barbiturates.
Did you go to people's cabinet and just 

92
00:04:29,580 --> 00:04:29,580
scoop a few out?

93
00:04:31,470 --> 00:04:33,430
It was bad.
I was bad.

94
00:04:33,460 --> 00:04:36,190
I was the only three years ago.
Now it's probably five,

95
00:04:36,191 --> 00:04:36,880
five,
six years.

96
00:04:36,881 --> 00:04:37,630
Wow.
Yeah.

97
00:04:37,780 --> 00:04:39,610
Oh my God.
Can I even drank and you know,

98
00:04:39,611 --> 00:04:40,810
25 years.

99
00:04:40,950 --> 00:04:45,950
So was it a slow,
creepy thing where it's slowly crept in 

100
00:04:45,950 --> 00:04:46,440
on you?
How did you realize it had,

101
00:04:46,441 --> 00:04:46,920
had you,

102
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:51,610
you don't realize until you stopped for 
a few days and you go dark,

103
00:04:51,730 --> 00:04:53,470
you go.
If you don't take it for a few days,

104
00:04:53,471 --> 00:04:58,471
you get so sick,
like close to suicidal because what 

105
00:04:59,261 --> 00:05:02,320
happens is your,
your receptors for your uh,

106
00:05:02,321 --> 00:05:04,320
um.
What do you mean for your dopamine?

107
00:05:04,330 --> 00:05:09,070
Get clogged by barbiturates and you 
can't do so if you stop taking them,

108
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:14,400
the,
the dopamine can't get into those 

109
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:14,400
receptor holes.
Whoa.

110
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:14,770
Because they're filled.
Yes.

111
00:05:14,771 --> 00:05:19,771
So,
so you can't feel happiness until 

112
00:05:19,771 --> 00:05:20,620
eventually those go away.
And that's why it's so hard to kick.

113
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:22,210
Oh my God.
Yeah.

114
00:05:22,630 --> 00:05:27,630
So how did you kick it?
Just went dark white knuckled it like I 

115
00:05:27,630 --> 00:05:27,630
did drink.
And

116
00:05:27,630 --> 00:05:29,110
did I remember when you did drink and 
like that?

117
00:05:29,111 --> 00:05:34,111
Well I met you right after you did that.
I met you when I think when I met you 

118
00:05:34,111 --> 00:05:36,170
you were still drinking and then like 
right after I met you,

119
00:05:36,171 --> 00:05:36,850
you quit.
Yeah,

120
00:05:36,851 --> 00:05:38,320
that's right.
That's exactly right.

121
00:05:38,321 --> 00:05:39,740
And I was amazed that,
you know,

122
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:42,610
I know a lot of people,
it's most people,

123
00:05:42,611 --> 00:05:45,350
it's a struggle.
You have to go through therapy,

124
00:05:45,351 --> 00:05:47,790
you have to go through a,
you have to go through all this stuff,

125
00:05:47,830 --> 00:05:49,480
but you just knocked it off.

126
00:05:49,820 --> 00:05:54,180
Well I did do therapy and also my dad 
was an alcoholic so I,

127
00:05:54,260 --> 00:05:58,010
I had gone to Al Anon meetings for 
probably about year before I

128
00:05:58,010 --> 00:05:59,470
quit.
And uh,

129
00:05:59,700 --> 00:06:01,100
they knew the consequence.
I knew,

130
00:06:01,190 --> 00:06:03,140
I knew the consequences.
I'll send you the steps.

131
00:06:03,141 --> 00:06:05,390
Once you learn the steps,
it becomes like,

132
00:06:05,630 --> 00:06:07,010
okay,
I know what I need to do.

133
00:06:07,011 --> 00:06:08,870
I need to acknowledge that I have a 
problem,

134
00:06:08,871 --> 00:06:11,660
I need to work on whatever.
My higher power is.

135
00:06:11,661 --> 00:06:16,661
Like I went through it without going to.
Because I went to some meetings and it 

136
00:06:16,661 --> 00:06:17,660
was just like too many guys,
like,

137
00:06:17,661 --> 00:06:18,140
you know,
those,

138
00:06:18,141 --> 00:06:18,980
uh,
those little bits,

139
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,300
those guys in Boston would do about,
um,

140
00:06:21,860 --> 00:06:22,790
uh,
what was the,

141
00:06:22,820 --> 00:06:25,760
what was the guy's name?
Teddy Burger on Eddie's like,

142
00:06:25,970 --> 00:06:30,970
you see these guys at these meetings and
they act like they got it all figured 

143
00:06:30,970 --> 00:06:34,181
out.
The standing up there and I can proudly 

144
00:06:34,181 --> 00:06:37,301
say after 15 years I no longer crave 
alcohol.

145
00:06:37,371 --> 00:06:39,080
And he's like,
I'm in the back and I crack a soda.

146
00:06:39,081 --> 00:06:44,081
They like,
oh fuck.

147
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:51,520
How many times have we talked about him 
on the podcast?

148
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:56,880
But he's one of them,
not enough all time greats that people 

149
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:56,880
just never found out.

150
00:06:56,880 --> 00:07:01,650
Yeah.
The most raw talent Jerry Lewis kind of 

151
00:07:01,650 --> 00:07:01,650
talent where you just go like,
whoa.

152
00:07:01,650 --> 00:07:01,650
Yeah,
this thing,

153
00:07:01,650 --> 00:07:02,260
fascial,
Jerry Lewis,

154
00:07:02,620 --> 00:07:04,240
Jerry Lewis was talented.
Dude.

155
00:07:04,990 --> 00:07:06,220
You don't see,
you don't see it.

156
00:07:06,310 --> 00:07:06,840
Oh,
I mean,

157
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:08,740
sure.
But they're not similar.

158
00:07:08,741 --> 00:07:11,770
I just made God given talent,
but a weird comparison.

159
00:07:12,190 --> 00:07:13,420
Why'd you go with Jerry Lewis?

160
00:07:14,060 --> 00:07:16,040
I guess just the physicality,
you know,

161
00:07:16,041 --> 00:07:18,920
they're almost like dancers.
The way they can move on stage.

162
00:07:18,921 --> 00:07:23,921
Like teddy would just glide around and 
is like hand movements and the way he'd 

163
00:07:23,921 --> 00:07:24,410
slide it was just kinda

164
00:07:24,530 --> 00:07:28,170
what was telling in his timing was just 
impeccable.

165
00:07:28,260 --> 00:07:33,260
Right.
I remember when I was an open mic night 

166
00:07:33,260 --> 00:07:33,260
guy,
like,

167
00:07:33,260 --> 00:07:33,260
uh,
just started,

168
00:07:33,260 --> 00:07:34,590
teddy did a set and a,
he did a set,

169
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:35,640
like a,
you know,

170
00:07:35,641 --> 00:07:38,370
just dropped in and did like 10 minutes.
And I remember thinking,

171
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:41,790
I fucking know nothing.
I don't understand anything.

172
00:07:41,850 --> 00:07:42,420
Uh,
barely.

173
00:07:42,450 --> 00:07:43,680
I shouldn't even be up there.
Yeah.

174
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:45,570
It shouldn't be allowed to do this.
Yeah.

175
00:07:45,630 --> 00:07:47,400
But he got pills.
Got that guy.

176
00:07:47,430 --> 00:07:49,540
I watched that.
I watched A.

177
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:52,080
I remember the Mattapoisett in.
Yeah.

178
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:52,940
Do you remember that kid?
Yeah.

179
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:57,960
Damn.
By Redondo used to have that Gig and he 

180
00:07:57,960 --> 00:08:01,980
booked me and teddy was like a classy 
old hotel.

181
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:04,650
Well it was like a kind of bed and 
breakfast or something like that.

182
00:08:04,651 --> 00:08:09,651
Right.
So it had downstairs that had this 

183
00:08:09,651 --> 00:08:11,310
little showroom and it was real tight.
Seeding and small was an excellent gig.

184
00:08:11,310 --> 00:08:16,310
Like when you got the Gig,
you were a great gig and it was in kind 

185
00:08:16,310 --> 00:08:17,040
of like a resort.
It sort of vacation the area,

186
00:08:17,050 --> 00:08:18,960
so people were partying,
having a good time.

187
00:08:19,170 --> 00:08:21,240
So it was a fun crowd.
And uh,

188
00:08:21,241 --> 00:08:24,570
I remember teddy showed up and he was 
just zonked,

189
00:08:24,750 --> 00:08:28,210
zonked out on pills and it was just so 
sad to watch.

190
00:08:28,211 --> 00:08:33,211
It was like,
this guy was an all time great and he 

191
00:08:33,211 --> 00:08:35,190
was just so out of it.
And I remember being up at the,

192
00:08:35,191 --> 00:08:37,290
uh,
the andover.

193
00:08:37,610 --> 00:08:39,660
It was a club in Aa was addict already 
gig.

194
00:08:39,661 --> 00:08:44,661
It was at a club called CIC land and a 
grill and grill 93,

195
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:50,190
something like that.
Ninety nine or [inaudible] 93.

196
00:08:50,250 --> 00:08:51,090
Yeah.
Yeah.

197
00:08:51,190 --> 00:08:52,120
And so,
uh,

198
00:08:52,180 --> 00:08:57,180
teddy comes in on Friday night and he's 
as shit the feature and I'm stretching 

199
00:08:57,180 --> 00:08:57,570
with material.
I don't have.

200
00:08:57,571 --> 00:09:02,571
I'm doing your material at this point.
I got my hand above my head doing my 

201
00:09:02,571 --> 00:09:06,471
refeer girl impression and uh,
and he comes in late and then I see him 

202
00:09:06,471 --> 00:09:07,260
talks to the club owner.
He's like,

203
00:09:07,900 --> 00:09:09,230
I was that guy.
You wouldn't believe it happen.

204
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:14,280
I'm coming up on 93 north and sky 
sideswipes may knocks off my mirror this

205
00:09:14,470 --> 00:09:15,420
after the show.
He says,

206
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:20,600
come out and look at my car,
and we got to the car and a side mirror 

207
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:20,730
is hanging off,
and the guy was like,

208
00:09:20,731 --> 00:09:24,660
all right,
so a Saturday and I comes up there,

209
00:09:24,661 --> 00:09:29,661
I get to stretch sign again.
I got to do another half hour teddy 

210
00:09:29,661 --> 00:09:30,180
shows up and he goes and walks in and he
goes,

211
00:09:30,450 --> 00:09:32,430
hey,
I got sideswiped and 93 north.

212
00:09:32,431 --> 00:09:34,470
You got to see my side view mirror.
The guy's like,

213
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:36,210
are you kidding?
It's like,

214
00:09:36,211 --> 00:09:37,770
no,
it's just fucking happened.

215
00:09:38,170 --> 00:09:39,470
Oh Wow.

216
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:41,150
So he was so out of it.
I forgot.

217
00:09:41,151 --> 00:09:42,740
He told the same log two nights in a 
row.

218
00:09:43,070 --> 00:09:48,070
That's his move.
Just kicked this fucking mirror pills,

219
00:09:49,310 --> 00:09:49,910
man.
Hey,

220
00:09:50,260 --> 00:09:55,260
you are.
You're swiping them from your friends 

221
00:09:55,260 --> 00:09:55,260
now.
Yeah,

222
00:09:55,260 --> 00:09:55,420
it was ugly.
Brendan Schaub,

223
00:09:55,430 --> 00:10:00,430
my friend had a nose job because nose 
got broken in a UFC fight and he got 

224
00:10:01,431 --> 00:10:03,130
hooked on pain pills.
See the.

225
00:10:03,140 --> 00:10:08,140
He was,
he's Bryan's partner on fire and the 

226
00:10:08,140 --> 00:10:08,140
kid.
What was he hooked on?

227
00:10:08,270 --> 00:10:12,450
Oxy.
Oxy is where you can't turn back that.

228
00:10:12,451 --> 00:10:16,440
That's the fucking hardcore.
He started out with Oxycodone,

229
00:10:16,460 --> 00:10:19,850
sloman lighter.
Then you get into Vicodin and you know,

230
00:10:20,060 --> 00:10:23,900
we had those guys on Chris and Mark Bell
from prescription thugs.

231
00:10:23,901 --> 00:10:26,660
It's a new documentary that's out now on
itunes.

232
00:10:26,990 --> 00:10:28,700
They're the same guys who did bigger,
stronger,

233
00:10:28,701 --> 00:10:31,790
faster and trophy kids.
Great guys,

234
00:10:31,820 --> 00:10:34,940
great documentary guys.
While this guy's doing the documentary,

235
00:10:34,941 --> 00:10:39,941
he's doing a documentary around 
prescription drugs and how many people 

236
00:10:39,941 --> 00:10:42,731
get prescribed them and how insane the 
businesses and how over prescribed they 

237
00:10:42,731 --> 00:10:42,731
are.

238
00:10:42,731 --> 00:10:46,570
While he's doing it.
He has to get hip replacement surgery 

239
00:10:46,570 --> 00:10:46,630
and he gets hooked now.
Shit,

240
00:10:46,820 --> 00:10:51,820
he's doing the documentary.
He's hooked on pills and he's got to 

241
00:10:51,820 --> 00:10:53,530
kind of cover it up and these kind of 
hot.

242
00:10:53,690 --> 00:10:58,690
He's embarrassed because like he's 
trying to put together this documentary 

243
00:10:58,690 --> 00:10:59,480
and he's hooked on pills and then 
finally in the documentary,

244
00:10:59,481 --> 00:11:04,481
once he becomes clean,
then he just comes clean in the 

245
00:11:04,481 --> 00:11:04,481
documentary and.
Oh Wow.

246
00:11:04,481 --> 00:11:05,720
He was on pills.
Wow.

247
00:11:05,721 --> 00:11:06,770
That's amazing.
Yeah.

248
00:11:06,771 --> 00:11:09,560
He takes you out to his car and he shows
you his car,

249
00:11:09,561 --> 00:11:12,590
like how we fucking collided in the shit
when he was all pilled up.

250
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:17,640
Yeah.
It shows all the dense and his 

251
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:17,640
headlight's hanging off and it's dark.
Well,

252
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:22,241
Philip Seymour Hoffman got back on drugs
because he was doing a role that was 

253
00:11:22,241 --> 00:11:22,241
very.
I,

254
00:11:22,241 --> 00:11:25,880
he on drugs in the role or was he drunk?
But whatever it was,

255
00:11:25,881 --> 00:11:30,881
he'd been sober for like 20 years and 
going into this place night after night 

256
00:11:30,881 --> 00:11:35,561
doing this play,
he started taking pills again and you 

257
00:11:35,561 --> 00:11:35,561
know,
any.

258
00:11:35,561 --> 00:11:39,800
I just don't get why doctors prescribe 
pills to somebody who's a known addict.

259
00:11:39,830 --> 00:11:42,350
They don't give a fuck.
They don't give a shit that.

260
00:11:42,380 --> 00:11:46,530
I think doctors get so used to people 
being sick and people dying and it's,

261
00:11:47,180 --> 00:11:49,070
you know,
it just becomes normal to them.

262
00:11:49,410 --> 00:11:50,450
Just,
you know,

263
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:53,230
I had this woman,
Dr Rhonda Patrick in the other day.

264
00:11:53,231 --> 00:11:54,460
She's a research scientist

265
00:11:54,460 --> 00:11:57,300
and she was talking about a lot of the 
experiments that they had to do with.

266
00:11:57,310 --> 00:12:00,850
He had to kill mice and when she first 
started doing these experiments,

267
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:03,500
should we get really sad and she'd cry 
and this like.

268
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:05,230
It was like,
it was just really upsetting.

269
00:12:05,860 --> 00:12:10,860
After a couple months she says gas and 
these motherfuckers looking at 

270
00:12:10,860 --> 00:12:10,860
Auschwitz.
She didn't even care.

271
00:12:10,860 --> 00:12:11,910
You just get totally used to it.
Yeah,

272
00:12:12,070 --> 00:12:15,160
and I think for doctors,
you're a doctor for 10 years,

273
00:12:15,161 --> 00:12:16,510
20 years,
30 years,

274
00:12:16,511 --> 00:12:21,511
40 years,
all these patients are sick and dying 

275
00:12:21,511 --> 00:12:21,511
and all fucked up.
No one sees you.

276
00:12:21,511 --> 00:12:25,801
If they're doing great,
everybody sees you because they got a 

277
00:12:25,801 --> 00:12:27,280
tumor or a broken leg and he just take 
these pills and get the fuck outta here.

278
00:12:29,290 --> 00:12:32,440
You're just a mouse here.
Have some cheese and some pills.

279
00:12:32,540 --> 00:12:37,540
Chris Bell,
the guy who made that documentary just 

280
00:12:37,540 --> 00:12:38,720
sent me a text yesterday saying that 
I'll say I'll forward it to you,

281
00:12:38,770 --> 00:12:41,360
Jamie,
and you can put it up here,

282
00:12:41,450 --> 00:12:45,860
but he was saying that there's a,
a new law that just got passed.

283
00:12:46,060 --> 00:12:47,780
A doctors are urged,
okay,

284
00:12:47,781 --> 00:12:49,880
this is what it is.
It's on US USA Today.

285
00:12:50,930 --> 00:12:55,920
You could find it from yesterday.
I'm new guidelines for prescription,

286
00:12:55,980 --> 00:12:58,700
uh,
to reduce abuse and overdoses.

287
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:03,340
So there are urgent doctors to try to do
something about this because there's,

288
00:13:03,410 --> 00:13:08,410
they're finally starting to realize,
and I think a lot of it is just because 

289
00:13:08,410 --> 00:13:11,180
of all these documentaries and all these
internet blogs that are,

290
00:13:11,870 --> 00:13:14,120
that are coming out and youtube videos 
and all these,

291
00:13:14,121 --> 00:13:16,540
uh,
new stories where people are really kind

292
00:13:16,550 --> 00:13:19,880
of grasping the magnitude of this 
problem.

293
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:25,240
I just don't understand why there's not 
one database where you can have multiple

294
00:13:25,251 --> 00:13:27,710
doctors writing prescriptions for the 
same patient.

295
00:13:27,711 --> 00:13:29,840
I mean,
if you go to cvs or rite aid,

296
00:13:29,841 --> 00:13:34,841
there should be a listing of any time 
you were specifically for the 

297
00:13:35,030 --> 00:13:36,230
recipients.
No,

298
00:13:36,350 --> 00:13:41,350
fuck.
I mean it didn't stop me and I can 

299
00:13:41,350 --> 00:13:41,910
remember getting a fresh bottle,
you know,

300
00:13:41,911 --> 00:13:43,920
30 pills in it and just holding your 
hand like,

301
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:46,200
Oh fuck,
joy bottle.

302
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:48,420
It never took anything like that.
No,

303
00:13:48,421 --> 00:13:53,421
never.
I took one time when I had my knee 

304
00:13:53,421 --> 00:13:55,560
operated on my first knee operation,
which was the Patella tendon graft,

305
00:13:55,800 --> 00:14:00,800
which is particularly painful because 
they take a piece of bone out of your 

306
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:04,461
shin and a piece of bone out of your 
kneecap attached to a strip of your 

307
00:14:05,191 --> 00:14:10,191
patella tendon.
Your patella tendon is a large tenant 

308
00:14:10,191 --> 00:14:13,671
that's in the front of your knee.
It's this one that goes from your knee 

309
00:14:13,671 --> 00:14:13,770
down to your Shin,
right?

310
00:14:14,030 --> 00:14:19,030
Fat One,
and what they do is they take a slice 

311
00:14:19,030 --> 00:14:21,030
out of that and then they open you up 
like a fish and then they use that slice

312
00:14:21,090 --> 00:14:26,090
and that replaces your acl.
So that becomes a new acl because this 

313
00:14:26,090 --> 00:14:27,800
patella tendon graft is really big.
It's really don't need the whole thing,

314
00:14:27,810 --> 00:14:28,260
the whole thing.

315
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:33,440
So they take a slice of that and it 
creates a new acl and the pain was 

316
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:36,390
pretty insane around the places where 
they cut the bone out.

317
00:14:36,450 --> 00:14:38,010
Yeah,
it was just like fire.

318
00:14:38,220 --> 00:14:39,780
So they gave me something.
I don't remember,

319
00:14:39,781 --> 00:14:41,170
it was Vicodin or percocet.
It was,

320
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:45,750
but I remember I took it once and I felt
so stupid,

321
00:14:46,110 --> 00:14:49,290
like I was just like dirt or you think 
it was Vicodin?

322
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:52,730
I was so dumb.
I mean it's just my own biology.

323
00:14:52,731 --> 00:14:54,530
The way I reacted to it,
I was like,

324
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:59,560
I'd rather take the pain.
So I sold them to this dude at the pool 

325
00:14:59,560 --> 00:14:59,560
hall.
This guy named Jeff,

326
00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:00,680
this Guy Jeff,
he always,

327
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:03,860
he would buy and sell pills.
He's a pill head.

328
00:15:03,890 --> 00:15:08,840
He looked like a classic dirt bag from a
fucking Beavis and butthead cartoon.

329
00:15:09,290 --> 00:15:14,290
He had like long hair that will go down 
like this and one of those mustaches 

330
00:15:14,290 --> 00:15:17,090
that curled all the way down to like the
bottom of his like.

331
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:18,000
Whereas Chin.

332
00:15:18,100 --> 00:15:18,570
Yeah,
did.

333
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:20,210
Yeah,
he was such a dirt bag.

334
00:15:20,211 --> 00:15:22,700
This guy,
he had a pickup truck rusted out,

335
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:27,880
probably had a one of those El Camino's 
we'll pick up and he would drink beer 

336
00:15:29,241 --> 00:15:31,610
out of the back of it with some friends 
and he definitely.

337
00:15:31,611 --> 00:15:33,620
He was a dirt bag.
Nice guy though.

338
00:15:33,890 --> 00:15:34,950
But he was a,
you know,

339
00:15:35,150 --> 00:15:38,020
just a classic classic guy.
I was like,

340
00:15:38,030 --> 00:15:39,620
I can't fucking take these things.
He goes,

341
00:15:39,621 --> 00:15:41,390
you got them at home,
bring them in.

342
00:15:41,391 --> 00:15:42,990
I'll buy him off.
I'm like,

343
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,570
all right.
So I sold them.

344
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:49,720
I became a drug dealer.
She given me a bottle with your name on 

345
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:49,720
it.
Oh yeah.

346
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:51,720
Fuck.
What the fuck was I back then?

347
00:15:51,770 --> 00:15:53,330
Stand behind my.
Oh no buddy.

348
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:55,930
You know,
it wasn't like me today or anything with

349
00:15:55,940 --> 00:15:58,370
my address or anything.
I was just struggling.

350
00:15:58,371 --> 00:16:01,190
Standup comedian.
He liked to play pool selling drugs,

351
00:16:01,191 --> 00:16:05,300
selling drugs to a dirt bag,
slang in the pool hall.

352
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:08,750
I was psyched to get that money to tell 
ya know.

353
00:16:08,810 --> 00:16:13,040
It's interesting like what?
Like 50 bucks is when you really need it

354
00:16:13,130 --> 00:16:15,530
and is 50 bucks when you don't need it,
you know,

355
00:16:15,531 --> 00:16:17,870
money loses.
It doesn't mean anything.

356
00:16:17,900 --> 00:16:22,900
Like that's why I never understand 
someone that works incredibly hard,

357
00:16:24,921 --> 00:16:28,580
but they're already insanely wealthy and
they're doing something they don't enjoy

358
00:16:28,581 --> 00:16:33,581
doing.
They're like constantly trying to 

359
00:16:33,581 --> 00:16:34,400
conquer and build a business and keep 
going and going,

360
00:16:34,670 --> 00:16:39,670
but they already have billions of 
dollars in what they're doing is making 

361
00:16:39,670 --> 00:16:40,100
them miserable.
Not only that,

362
00:16:40,130 --> 00:16:43,160
take it to a next level where you got a 
guy like the Koch brothers.

363
00:16:43,250 --> 00:16:46,160
Yes,
and they are not only working way harder

364
00:16:46,161 --> 00:16:51,161
than they need to.
They've already covered the next 50 

365
00:16:51,161 --> 00:16:52,070
generations of kids did never have to 
work and their family,

366
00:16:52,790 --> 00:16:57,080
but they're killing the planet.
So if you're thinking about a legacy for

367
00:16:57,081 --> 00:16:58,400
your great,
great grandkids,

368
00:16:58,640 --> 00:17:03,640
they're going to live in a 140 degree 
earth with no water surrounded by 

369
00:17:03,640 --> 00:17:04,120
fucking,
you know,

370
00:17:04,310 --> 00:17:05,670
killers,
mad max.

371
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:07,430
Do you think that's what's going to 
happen?

372
00:17:09,230 --> 00:17:11,660
I think so,
yeah.

373
00:17:12,190 --> 00:17:14,960
And it's all gonna fall apart.
I'm not stressed out about it.

374
00:17:14,961 --> 00:17:16,460
I just feel like really,
you know,

375
00:17:16,461 --> 00:17:21,461
it's gonna happen.
I'm gonna encourage my kids not to 

376
00:17:21,461 --> 00:17:21,461
reproduce.
I think that they're going to skate,

377
00:17:21,461 --> 00:17:25,810
they're going to skate through.
There'll be a lot of terrorism and 

378
00:17:25,810 --> 00:17:26,510
there's going to be a lot of flooding 
and some crazy storms.

379
00:17:26,990 --> 00:17:30,800
We have third world countries are all 
gonna be in an upheaval because you know

380
00:17:30,801 --> 00:17:33,740
the environment is.
If it's gonna affect the poor first.

381
00:17:34,610 --> 00:17:35,330
Of course.

382
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:41,120
I wonder how much it was blown out of 
proportion and how much of it can be 

383
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:42,420
mitigated by new discoveries and new 
science and new technology.

384
00:17:42,660 --> 00:17:44,790
Solar power.
Do you know?

385
00:17:44,850 --> 00:17:49,850
Did you know?
I didn't know this until Eddie Bravo 

386
00:17:49,850 --> 00:17:49,980
came over here and I went down to the 
God damn hole about

387
00:17:49,980 --> 00:17:52,860
Rockefeller grandson.
Well,

388
00:17:52,861 --> 00:17:55,710
yeah.
Did you know that Rockefeller made there

389
00:17:55,711 --> 00:18:00,711
was a conspiracy to get people to use 
oil instead of alcohol and that most 

390
00:18:02,191 --> 00:18:06,570
combustion engines work on alcohol and 
they work just as good,

391
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:11,190
if not better on alcohol than they do on
gasoline and alcohol.

392
00:18:11,191 --> 00:18:16,191
Obviously you don't need fossil fuels,
you don't need or whatever you want to 

393
00:18:16,191 --> 00:18:16,520
call it.
Vegetable.

394
00:18:16,540 --> 00:18:17,580
Yeah.
Porn,

395
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:19,770
you know,
they run just as good on that.

396
00:18:19,900 --> 00:18:21,510
Yeah.
What the fuck?

397
00:18:22,260 --> 00:18:23,140
Yeah.
I mean he,

398
00:18:23,390 --> 00:18:26,230
well,
between him doing that and then um,

399
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:27,370
you know,
for it,

400
00:18:27,371 --> 00:18:31,870
didn't Ford buy up all the train the 
train tracks in Los Angeles to create a,

401
00:18:31,940 --> 00:18:34,920
a car society instead of a train 
society?

402
00:18:34,980 --> 00:18:39,980
Yeah.
There's some sort of conspiracy or were 

403
00:18:39,980 --> 00:18:40,110
they the auto?
I don't think it's conspiracy.

404
00:18:40,111 --> 00:18:42,810
I think it definitely happened.
I don't mean that it's a conspiracy that

405
00:18:42,830 --> 00:18:43,530
doesn't exist.

406
00:18:43,530 --> 00:18:48,530
I mean,
they conspired that they could conspire 

407
00:18:48,530 --> 00:18:49,980
to do something like that.
I don't know too much about that though.

408
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:51,660
Is a film about it.
Uh,

409
00:18:51,670 --> 00:18:52,740
they,
the killing,

410
00:18:52,741 --> 00:18:55,440
the killing her killing of the car or 
something.

411
00:18:55,441 --> 00:18:56,370
Yeah.
Well that's different.

412
00:18:56,371 --> 00:18:58,320
That's a late model.
That's who killed the electric car.

413
00:18:58,321 --> 00:19:03,321
That was one of the electric car first.
See they had electric cars a long 

414
00:19:03,321 --> 00:19:07,431
fucking time ago.
We have the museum of cars and they've 

415
00:19:07,431 --> 00:19:07,431
been.
The first cars were electric.

416
00:19:07,431 --> 00:19:07,620
Yeah.
How about,

417
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:09,690
you know,
these to Henry Ford and fenders that are

418
00:19:09,691 --> 00:19:12,220
made out of hemp.
That was something we covered with shit.

419
00:19:12,390 --> 00:19:13,680
Yeah.
You can hit them with a hammer.

420
00:19:13,740 --> 00:19:18,740
Last videos of him like whacking these 
fenders with a hammer because hemp is 

421
00:19:18,740 --> 00:19:20,640
hemp fibers.
Insanely powerful,

422
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:23,070
unbelievably strong and really 
lightweight.

423
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:25,680
Like more powerful than fiberglass.
Stronger than.

424
00:19:25,740 --> 00:19:26,700
I mean,
it's amazing,

425
00:19:26,701 --> 00:19:27,390
amazing stuff.

426
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:29,330
And so he's hitting it with a fucking 
hammer.

427
00:19:29,340 --> 00:19:34,340
The Hammer is bouncing off this tender 
that he had a shit bought back then,

428
00:19:34,411 --> 00:19:39,411
man.
They were all jockeying for control of 

429
00:19:39,411 --> 00:19:41,511
this emerging industry and they didn't 
see anything bad about just trying to 

430
00:19:41,511 --> 00:19:41,820
control the market.
Like,

431
00:19:41,821 --> 00:19:43,350
fuck,
fuck these trains.

432
00:19:43,420 --> 00:19:44,820
Yeah,
fuck your tracks.

433
00:19:44,990 --> 00:19:46,320
Yeah.
I want everybody to have cars.

434
00:19:46,321 --> 00:19:51,321
Like they didn't think one day I was 
going to heat up the planet and polar 

435
00:19:51,321 --> 00:19:51,321
bears going to drown,
you know?

436
00:19:51,321 --> 00:19:52,200
Yeah,
of course.

437
00:19:52,410 --> 00:19:57,410
I mean,
if they could've seen that poster of 

438
00:19:57,410 --> 00:19:57,410
fucking,
you know,

439
00:19:57,410 --> 00:19:59,160
polar bear stuck on a,
on a little,

440
00:19:59,161 --> 00:20:00,840
uh,
what do you call this?

441
00:20:00,930 --> 00:20:02,850
Ice Float.
Ice Ice floats.

442
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:07,880
Did you see the video that got recently 
of a polar bear chasing down a female 

443
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:09,150
and her cub and eating the curb in front
of her?

444
00:20:10,590 --> 00:20:12,070
Yeah.
Holy Cow.

445
00:20:12,280 --> 00:20:14,280
These explorers were there.

446
00:20:14,330 --> 00:20:16,770
It was either explorers or might've been
a cruise,

447
00:20:17,070 --> 00:20:18,780
but they watched it and they were 
screaming.

448
00:20:19,060 --> 00:20:20,880
No,
no.

449
00:20:21,310 --> 00:20:24,510
And he just chases down the female and 
she's running full clip,

450
00:20:24,511 --> 00:20:26,040
but she's got the curb with her in the 
cub camp.

451
00:20:26,041 --> 00:20:31,041
Run that fast and following.
He grabs a cub and he eats it right in 

452
00:20:31,041 --> 00:20:31,320
front of her.
He think it was his child.

453
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:33,060
It doesn't matter.
They don't give a fuck.

454
00:20:33,510 --> 00:20:35,850
They don't give a fuck.
All bears are cannibals.

455
00:20:35,910 --> 00:20:40,910
Yeah.
You know when there's a real problem 

456
00:20:40,910 --> 00:20:43,131
with movies like Zootopia,
which I took my kids to see the other 

457
00:20:43,131 --> 00:20:43,131
day was really adorable.
Very cute.

458
00:20:43,131 --> 00:20:47,871
Moving.
Not a problem with the movie would have 

459
00:20:47,871 --> 00:20:48,010
problem with what comes out of that 
movie and these fucking.

460
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:51,220
What would you do for a Klondike bar ads
and these,

461
00:20:51,340 --> 00:20:53,740
these things that anthropomorphize 
animals.

462
00:20:53,741 --> 00:20:54,340
Here it is right now.

463
00:20:54,340 --> 00:20:59,340
If you want to watch it.
See that's the mother and the cubs 

464
00:20:59,340 --> 00:21:01,540
running full clip and there's the big 
daddy can't run up behind.

465
00:21:01,660 --> 00:21:03,940
It has taken off.
Right?

466
00:21:03,970 --> 00:21:05,440
So we're just going to watch it on the 
screen.

467
00:21:05,470 --> 00:21:07,430
If we put it on you.
Can you go full screen with it though?

468
00:21:07,750 --> 00:21:09,160
It's not going.
Oh,

469
00:21:09,580 --> 00:21:10,780
okay.
That's,

470
00:21:10,781 --> 00:21:13,060
that's the mom trying to head off 
trying,

471
00:21:13,090 --> 00:21:14,440
but he's like kid out here,
bitch.

472
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:16,630
She can't do anything.
He's like twice her size.

473
00:21:17,890 --> 00:21:19,600
The honest stay tune.
There it is.

474
00:21:19,601 --> 00:21:21,610
Boom.
That's what they do.

475
00:21:23,310 --> 00:21:25,090
It's awful.
They eat them.

476
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:27,790
I mean,
when bears come out of hibernation,

477
00:21:27,791 --> 00:21:32,440
one of the first things they do is head 
for the cubs.

478
00:21:33,130 --> 00:21:38,130
For Haley,
the male bears immediately go and kill 

479
00:21:38,130 --> 00:21:38,130
the cubs.
They eat them.

480
00:21:38,130 --> 00:21:40,360
That mom is trying to put up a fight and
a little bit,

481
00:21:40,361 --> 00:21:41,830
but she's just so much smaller.

482
00:21:41,830 --> 00:21:44,050
She's scared and she knows the baby's 
already dead.

483
00:21:45,100 --> 00:21:47,350
There's nothing she could do,
so she turns and then just runs.

484
00:21:47,380 --> 00:21:50,620
She realizes at a certain point in time,
this motherfucker might eat her too,

485
00:21:50,650 --> 00:21:52,750
which does happen by the way.
Really?

486
00:21:52,780 --> 00:21:54,250
Yeah.
They cannibalize each other.

487
00:21:54,340 --> 00:21:56,170
They kill each other and cannibalize 
each other.

488
00:21:56,350 --> 00:22:01,350
Oftentimes when you hunt bears,
if you kill one bear and you leave it 

489
00:22:01,991 --> 00:22:04,570
like to go back and get a truck to pull 
it out of the woods.

490
00:22:05,170 --> 00:22:06,310
When you do that,
you come back.

491
00:22:06,311 --> 00:22:07,340
Other bears,
we eating it.

492
00:22:08,170 --> 00:22:13,170
Bears were all cannibals,
but my point was that like people have 

493
00:22:13,170 --> 00:22:15,200
this idea of what these wild animals are
that you know,

494
00:22:15,250 --> 00:22:18,310
they live in harmony in nature.
It's chaos.

495
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:24,800
It's chaos and conflict and murder all 
day long and cannibalism especially 

496
00:22:25,001 --> 00:22:27,670
bears a 100 percent cannibals.
All of them,

497
00:22:28,060 --> 00:22:30,520
not only with,
when we were in Alberta,

498
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:35,640
my friend who runs a hunting camp up 
there watched a male bear killer cub in 

499
00:22:35,981 --> 00:22:36,700
front of the female.

500
00:22:36,700 --> 00:22:39,370
The female tried to fight them off.
The male bear killed a cub.

501
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:42,850
She chased him off eventually and then 
she went and finished it.

502
00:22:42,851 --> 00:22:45,510
Oh no,
she ate her own cup.

503
00:22:45,700 --> 00:22:47,070
Wow.
Yeah.

504
00:22:47,110 --> 00:22:50,050
Wow.
That's harsh man.

505
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:53,080
I've got mad at my kids,
but like,

506
00:22:53,081 --> 00:22:56,740
I pull up a little short of that.
Why don't think the male was the,

507
00:22:56,741 --> 00:22:57,400
uh,
the father.

508
00:22:57,401 --> 00:22:58,690
He might've been,
but who knows?

509
00:22:58,691 --> 00:23:01,090
He might not even know.
She probably knew either.

510
00:23:01,650 --> 00:23:04,820
I thought some bears were just ate 
berries and shadow.

511
00:23:05,050 --> 00:23:06,250
No.
All bears eat meat.

512
00:23:06,370 --> 00:23:08,530
Yeah.
We'll all North American bears,

513
00:23:08,550 --> 00:23:13,550
man.
They don't mean they don't eat meat 

514
00:23:13,550 --> 00:23:15,751
exclusively,
but they're omnivores except polar 

515
00:23:15,751 --> 00:23:18,571
bears.
Polar bears and 100 percent Predator 

516
00:23:18,571 --> 00:23:18,571
that the only bear that doesn't need 
anything but meat.

517
00:23:18,571 --> 00:23:20,050
They just,
they don't have anything up there.

518
00:23:20,051 --> 00:23:25,051
There's no vegetables.
So everything they eat is just meet the 

519
00:23:25,051 --> 00:23:25,051
seals and anything that fucks up.

520
00:23:25,110 --> 00:23:30,110
Yeah.
When you look at the territory is that 

521
00:23:30,110 --> 00:23:30,110
certain animals need,
like they were doing a thing about,

522
00:23:30,110 --> 00:23:30,940
um,
about uh,

523
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:35,960
mountain lions in Los Angeles,
and if one there was a,

524
00:23:36,300 --> 00:23:41,300
each mountain lion needs like 20 square 
miles of territory just for him.

525
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:44,850
And if you get within that,
it's a fight to the death.

526
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:46,130
That's,
those are the stakes.

527
00:23:46,130 --> 00:23:51,130
And so there's one mountain lion was 
living up in the Santa Monica mountains 

528
00:23:51,130 --> 00:23:52,700
like above the Palisades Malibu.
And uh,

529
00:23:52,850 --> 00:23:54,770
he somehow,
because they tagged them,

530
00:23:55,130 --> 00:24:00,130
he somehow ended up over in griffith 
park across the four.

531
00:24:00,771 --> 00:24:01,820
Oh,
five.

532
00:24:01,970 --> 00:24:03,980
Did you see what he did?
He killed a Koala bear.

533
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:10,720
Oh No.
He climbed a fence for the 12 foot tall 

534
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:15,371
fence covered with barb wire,
got over the fence and killed a qual 

535
00:24:15,371 --> 00:24:16,730
bird.
Good for him.

536
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:20,180
You know where there's a will,
there's a way.

537
00:24:20,870 --> 00:24:23,480
Will they found these mountain lions and
San Francisco,

538
00:24:23,481 --> 00:24:28,481
you know,
because California doesn't have hunting 

539
00:24:28,481 --> 00:24:28,481
laws for mountain lions.
I mean,

540
00:24:28,481 --> 00:24:31,040
they have laws against it.
You cannot hunt mountain lions,

541
00:24:31,100 --> 00:24:36,100
right?
Wildlife Biologists are seriously 

542
00:24:36,100 --> 00:24:37,010
against because when you can't control 
Predator populations,

543
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:39,860
they just breed and breed and breed 
until it becomes too many of them.

544
00:24:40,130 --> 00:24:42,350
Like you there.
They don't have any predators other than

545
00:24:42,351 --> 00:24:42,800
a man.

546
00:24:43,010 --> 00:24:44,570
So you know,
people can say,

547
00:24:44,571 --> 00:24:46,850
well,
let nature balance and tickets will.

548
00:24:46,851 --> 00:24:51,851
That means they move into neighborhood,
meet your friends were part of the 

549
00:24:51,851 --> 00:24:54,791
balance.
We're part of the balance and we think 

550
00:24:54,791 --> 00:24:54,791
we're not because we have the internet 
and the fucking cell phone,

551
00:24:54,791 --> 00:24:56,060
but the reality is they don't give a 
shit about that.

552
00:24:56,360 --> 00:24:58,500
So anyway,
these mountain lions,

553
00:24:58,540 --> 00:24:59,930
they've been killing because they,
they.

554
00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:02,300
What they have to do is when they invade
neighborhoods,

555
00:25:02,301 --> 00:25:03,890
start killing dogs and threatening 
people,

556
00:25:03,891 --> 00:25:04,490
they have to kill them.
Well,

557
00:25:04,491 --> 00:25:08,060
they killed over 100 of them the last 
year and yeah.

558
00:25:08,140 --> 00:25:08,720
Yeah,
they are.

559
00:25:08,721 --> 00:25:10,580
They have to shoot them.
They just do it privately.

560
00:25:10,581 --> 00:25:12,380
They don't talk about it.
It doesn't make the news,

561
00:25:12,650 --> 00:25:17,650
but when they shot them,
they found out that their primary diet 

562
00:25:17,650 --> 00:25:17,650
is pets.
Yeah,

563
00:25:17,690 --> 00:25:18,420
of course.
Cats,

564
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:20,990
dogs.
That's the primary diet like they were.

565
00:25:21,070 --> 00:25:25,400
It was only like a small percentage of 
deer in their belly and their bellies.

566
00:25:25,850 --> 00:25:27,920
Did you ever see any cats around your 
house?

567
00:25:28,070 --> 00:25:33,070
I've never seen a cat around my house,
but I saw a cat that killed my dog in 

568
00:25:33,070 --> 00:25:35,810
Colorado and I saw another mountain lion
in Santa Barbara on the.

569
00:25:35,811 --> 00:25:37,890
On a fucking residential road.
Yeah.

570
00:25:38,330 --> 00:25:39,620
Big.
It wasn't that big.

571
00:25:39,650 --> 00:25:42,550
It was like a small dog,
like 50,

572
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:43,880
60 pounds,
something like that.

573
00:25:43,881 --> 00:25:46,230
But it was big enough to freak me the 
fuck out here.

574
00:25:46,250 --> 00:25:48,950
But people know in the valley you don't 
leave your dog out in your yard.

575
00:25:49,100 --> 00:25:50,630
You just don't know.
You can't.

576
00:25:50,660 --> 00:25:52,160
It'll be fucking gone.
Well,

577
00:25:52,161 --> 00:25:53,780
coyote is mostly.
Yeah.

578
00:25:53,810 --> 00:25:55,100
But uh,
the,

579
00:25:55,550 --> 00:26:00,550
the mountain lion that I saw in Santa 
Monica or Santa Barbara rather looked 

580
00:26:00,550 --> 00:26:00,620
like a coyote.
Was that size wasn't that big?

581
00:26:00,630 --> 00:26:02,560
I thought it was a coyote and then I saw
the tail.

582
00:26:02,930 --> 00:26:04,490
Oh Shit,
that's a cat.

583
00:26:05,030 --> 00:26:08,540
It's seen a cat is so much creepier than
seeing a coyote.

584
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:13,600
Yeah,
because you know that they like a 

585
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:16,091
coyote.
I'm pretty sure I could fuck up a 

586
00:26:16,091 --> 00:26:16,091
coyote.
You know,

587
00:26:16,091 --> 00:26:19,180
if a coyote jumped on me,
I know I just grabbed him by his tail 

588
00:26:19,180 --> 00:26:19,350
and smash his fucking head off the 
ground.

589
00:26:19,370 --> 00:26:21,250
I had to figure out a way to.
When I get it,

590
00:26:21,500 --> 00:26:24,230
I think it's because of a bugs bunny.
And you know,

591
00:26:24,231 --> 00:26:26,090
the Wiley Coyote,
he was such a doof.

592
00:26:26,430 --> 00:26:28,520
He's just can't take the breed series.
Lena.

593
00:26:28,550 --> 00:26:29,420
Well,
they're scary.

594
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:31,180
I mean if a coyote wanted to kill you,
it,

595
00:26:31,181 --> 00:26:33,320
it'd be a real rat.
Wanted to kill you.

596
00:26:33,380 --> 00:26:35,070
It'd be a real fucking problem.
Right.

597
00:26:35,150 --> 00:26:40,150
But I'm pretty sure if you could snap 
and get into full rage psychopath mode,

598
00:26:40,520 --> 00:26:42,160
you could probably kill a coyote.
Yeah.

599
00:26:42,440 --> 00:26:44,700
But not a,
I don't think a mountain line.

600
00:26:44,701 --> 00:26:45,660
You'd be fucked.
Well,

601
00:26:45,850 --> 00:26:50,520
50 pounds and they sprang so fucking 
fast.

602
00:26:50,521 --> 00:26:51,600
So fast.
Yeah.

603
00:26:51,900 --> 00:26:56,900
They're so fast and they're so powerful.
And if you look at their bodies in 

604
00:26:56,900 --> 00:27:00,231
comparison to like,
they're like one of the most powerful 

605
00:27:00,231 --> 00:27:00,231
cats,
pound for pound.

606
00:27:00,231 --> 00:27:03,550
They have enormous wrists and forearms 
and their shoulders.

607
00:27:03,551 --> 00:27:05,000
They ripped.
Oh,

608
00:27:05,350 --> 00:27:07,180
I try to get shelled is like that at the
gym.

609
00:27:07,181 --> 00:27:11,140
I say Nick trainer,
I Want Mountain Lion Sheldon and they,

610
00:27:11,141 --> 00:27:15,340
and so they have a machine,
you know,

611
00:27:15,550 --> 00:27:17,650
and it's a shoulder machine,
shoulder machine.

612
00:27:17,651 --> 00:27:19,410
That's the mountain lion.
When you put it in,

613
00:27:19,411 --> 00:27:23,200
in this little pause and you growl and 
you put on,

614
00:27:23,410 --> 00:27:24,370
you know,
what just happened?

615
00:27:24,371 --> 00:27:26,470
There were people dressed as animals at 
um,

616
00:27:27,220 --> 00:27:32,220
I just did the Addison Improv Club,
great club and there was a convention 

617
00:27:33,491 --> 00:27:38,491
going on at my hotel.
There were hundreds of furries and they 

618
00:27:38,491 --> 00:27:40,420
were fantastic.
They had like,

619
00:27:40,780 --> 00:27:42,910
you know,
one is a zebra a lot,

620
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:46,450
a lot of like Unicorns and fucking 
rabbits.

621
00:27:46,570 --> 00:27:47,670
All mascots,
right?

622
00:27:47,740 --> 00:27:48,400
Yeah.
They look,

623
00:27:48,401 --> 00:27:49,930
it looked like a bunch of college 
mascots,

624
00:27:49,931 --> 00:27:52,720
but then some of them then you saw the 
dark side creep in,

625
00:27:52,721 --> 00:27:57,721
like some of them had little studied 
collars on because apparently at night 

626
00:27:57,721 --> 00:27:59,380
shit gets a little weird with some of 
them,

627
00:27:59,410 --> 00:28:02,460
you know,
there's holes in the costume and there's

628
00:28:02,470 --> 00:28:04,030
some furry sex going on.

629
00:28:04,030 --> 00:28:05,500
A lot of furries.
So yeah.

630
00:28:05,800 --> 00:28:06,850
Yeah.
But they were great.

631
00:28:06,851 --> 00:28:09,510
I took pictures with like 100 of them.
I just get mad.

632
00:28:09,890 --> 00:28:13,360
His thing is they're really into hugging
like the rule is,

633
00:28:13,361 --> 00:28:18,361
if you just ask any,
any of them will hug you and I would go 

634
00:28:18,361 --> 00:28:18,361
downstairs and get a cup of coffee.
I'd hug like three.

635
00:28:18,380 --> 00:28:20,790
Fuck,
that's hilarious.

636
00:28:22,780 --> 00:28:24,280
Can have a hug.
Sure.

637
00:28:24,281 --> 00:28:25,990
They just wrapped their arms around you 
and pat.

638
00:28:26,010 --> 00:28:28,510
You had their helmets on how they keep 
them on?

639
00:28:28,511 --> 00:28:33,511
Yeah,
they don't think around when they're 

640
00:28:33,511 --> 00:28:33,511
drinking the coffee and they keep it on 
a daily drink.

641
00:28:33,511 --> 00:28:33,610
Anything while you were like,
Oh yeah,

642
00:28:33,611 --> 00:28:35,500
I did,
but I was talking to the bartender down.

643
00:28:35,501 --> 00:28:37,000
I was having lunch downstairs.
I was like,

644
00:28:37,001 --> 00:28:38,380
these guys drank a lot.
He's like,

645
00:28:38,770 --> 00:28:43,330
I've sold one beer in the last day to 
these just uber nerds.

646
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:45,430
Whoa.
Uber nerds.

647
00:28:45,431 --> 00:28:50,431
They all have like the ones I saw at a 
costume had like just those Pale puffy 

648
00:28:50,651 --> 00:28:52,870
faces that look like they're just.

649
00:28:52,870 --> 00:28:57,220
The only light they've gotten is off a 
computer screen of the last 10 years and

650
00:28:57,221 --> 00:29:00,010
they really like asperger z,
you know,

651
00:29:00,011 --> 00:29:05,011
we'd be on the elevator and they were 
like a call out your floors and one guy 

652
00:29:05,011 --> 00:29:05,980
goes for other guy goes eight.
Yeah,

653
00:29:06,230 --> 00:29:10,750
there we go.
It was so bizarre.

654
00:29:10,770 --> 00:29:11,430
He goes,
uh,

655
00:29:11,740 --> 00:29:13,990
84.
That's four.

656
00:29:14,010 --> 00:29:17,530
It's half vate.
We are all looking at a griggs instagram

657
00:29:17,531 --> 00:29:19,390
right now.
Did you talk to them?

658
00:29:19,540 --> 00:29:21,050
Oh yeah.
Did you ask him what the,

659
00:29:21,130 --> 00:29:22,540
what's up?
Yeah,

660
00:29:22,541 --> 00:29:23,320
they said,
you know,

661
00:29:23,321 --> 00:29:25,060
we're,
we're in my town.

662
00:29:25,300 --> 00:29:30,300
I get made fun of because there's only 
two of us to do this and then I come 

663
00:29:30,300 --> 00:29:32,650
here and I just feel like so free.
And so like,

664
00:29:32,950 --> 00:29:34,980
you know,
among friends and the,

665
00:29:35,090 --> 00:29:40,090
there's a bunch of conventions that they
go to like comicon type places and they 

666
00:29:40,450 --> 00:29:43,780
get to know each and you know,
it's like a whole community for them.

667
00:29:43,870 --> 00:29:44,140
Yeah.

668
00:29:44,410 --> 00:29:45,550
You know what I mean man.
I mean,

669
00:29:45,551 --> 00:29:50,551
yeah,
it's retarded but no one's hurting them 

670
00:29:50,551 --> 00:29:50,551
or didn't.
No one's getting hurt.

671
00:29:50,551 --> 00:29:53,480
I'm jealous of anybody that finds like 
you've always had things you're 

672
00:29:53,480 --> 00:29:53,480
passionate about,
you know,

673
00:29:53,480 --> 00:29:55,830
whether it's taekwondo or you know,
mixed martial arts or whatever,

674
00:29:56,760 --> 00:29:59,160
and it's like to find something in your 
life,

675
00:29:59,161 --> 00:30:04,161
no matter what it is that gives you a 
community and gives you something that 

676
00:30:04,161 --> 00:30:05,670
you're going to,
you kind of grow in over time.

677
00:30:06,090 --> 00:30:07,240
It's great.
It doesn't matter what it is.

678
00:30:07,241 --> 00:30:08,370
Jealous of that.
Yeah.

679
00:30:08,371 --> 00:30:09,900
I never had that.
Never had that.

680
00:30:10,390 --> 00:30:11,940
What will you have interest though?

681
00:30:12,500 --> 00:30:16,190
I think family became the only thing I 
will stand up obviously,

682
00:30:16,260 --> 00:30:21,260
but family's the only thing I ever got 
really into like longterm committed.

683
00:30:22,310 --> 00:30:23,260
Don't get sick of

684
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:28,360
when you're old,
you'll be happy that you made that 

685
00:30:28,360 --> 00:30:30,641
choice because there's a lot of people 
that made the different choice and got 

686
00:30:30,641 --> 00:30:34,451
really obsessed with something else that
lead them away from their family when 

687
00:30:34,451 --> 00:30:35,930
they get older and they realized it was 
just bowling,

688
00:30:36,350 --> 00:30:41,350
right?
Like why did I have to go bowl all over 

689
00:30:41,350 --> 00:30:43,210
the world and miss my kids growing up 
because I got really into.

690
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:48,400
Yeah,
they a dude who was a big show runner 

691
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:50,280
here in La and I was friends with him 
and he got really into horses.

692
00:30:50,281 --> 00:30:53,880
He bought horses and they were up in 
Pasadena and he would go up there on the

693
00:30:53,881 --> 00:30:55,380
weekends.
He'd work all week and he'd go up on the

694
00:30:55,381 --> 00:30:59,100
weekends.
He had a daughter and a one night he was

695
00:30:59,101 --> 00:31:04,101
in the middle of dinner and he went 
upstairs to his room and he put a 

696
00:31:04,101 --> 00:31:04,101
plastic bag over sat and he killed 
himself.

697
00:31:04,620 --> 00:31:07,390
Are they related?
The horses and the kill himself?

698
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:09,100
Well,
I think he was.

699
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:12,640
He was away from his family.
He was like it with this free time.

700
00:31:13,150 --> 00:31:18,150
That's,
that's how he was spending it away all 

701
00:31:18,150 --> 00:31:21,001
the time and that's,
that's the only thing I could think of 

702
00:31:21,001 --> 00:31:23,491
that would cause it is like you ever sit
down with your family and this is the 

703
00:31:23,491 --> 00:31:23,491
greatest guy.
I mean,

704
00:31:23,491 --> 00:31:24,580
I love this guy,
but it just,

705
00:31:24,750 --> 00:31:29,750
it made me think like the saddest time.
Sometimes when you're with your family 

706
00:31:29,750 --> 00:31:31,210
and for whatever reason,
you're not feeling connected.

707
00:31:31,540 --> 00:31:35,650
You're just feeling like they're talking
and you're pretending to listen,

708
00:31:35,651 --> 00:31:39,850
but you're just in your head thinking,
why don't I feel close right now and you

709
00:31:39,851 --> 00:31:40,280
know,
and there's,

710
00:31:40,570 --> 00:31:43,150
most times you don't feel like that,
but once in a while you do and that,

711
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:48,360
those were like the saddest moments in 
my life because it's all right there in 

712
00:31:48,360 --> 00:31:49,000
front of me and I can't touch it.

713
00:31:49,580 --> 00:31:50,810
Ooh,
that's deep.

714
00:31:51,020 --> 00:31:52,280
Yeah.
Jesus.

715
00:31:53,240 --> 00:31:58,240
I mean obviously the guy's dead,
so there's no way we could ever really 

716
00:31:58,240 --> 00:32:01,121
know what his motive was or what the,
what the real big factor was that pushed

717
00:32:01,281 --> 00:32:06,200
them over the edge now.
But I think sometimes people just aren't

718
00:32:06,201 --> 00:32:11,201
fucking happy and I think it can.
You can narrow it down to a couple 

719
00:32:11,650 --> 00:32:16,650
different things or it can be.
It can be a group of experiences from 

720
00:32:16,821 --> 00:32:18,560
their life that they've never gotten 
over.

721
00:32:18,950 --> 00:32:21,170
It could be breakups,
you know,

722
00:32:21,171 --> 00:32:26,171
I know people that have been dumped like
in high school or college and just 

723
00:32:26,171 --> 00:32:27,020
really never recovered.
They,

724
00:32:27,021 --> 00:32:29,540
you know,
they had a love and then the person just

725
00:32:29,541 --> 00:32:31,190
left them for someone else or something 
like that.

726
00:32:31,191 --> 00:32:36,191
And then they never bounced back,
they fucking nose dive and went right 

727
00:32:36,191 --> 00:32:38,660
into the rocks and just never came out 
and never had another relationship.

728
00:32:39,340 --> 00:32:39,980
It's fucking,

729
00:32:40,020 --> 00:32:41,690
it's normal.
I mean,

730
00:32:41,691 --> 00:32:43,580
it happens.
It wasn't about that,

731
00:32:43,581 --> 00:32:45,710
like you said,
it wasn't about that relationship.

732
00:32:45,711 --> 00:32:47,350
It was about what came before at 
something.

733
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:49,760
Set the stage for them to be that 
fragile.

734
00:32:50,150 --> 00:32:52,830
That's the best way to say something.
Set the stage.

735
00:32:52,831 --> 00:32:56,240
Like once I loved and it was a gas,
soon turned out,

736
00:32:56,450 --> 00:33:01,450
had a heart of glass.
She was the first rapper she was,

737
00:33:06,740 --> 00:33:08,360
or one of them,
unless she was,

738
00:33:08,390 --> 00:33:11,270
she was hanging out with um,
uh,

739
00:33:11,300 --> 00:33:13,960
the sugarhill gang and all those guys.
Yeah.

740
00:33:14,690 --> 00:33:18,320
She hung out with the earliest rappers 
and was like at CBGBS.

741
00:33:18,321 --> 00:33:20,170
And then she'd go uptown.
Wow.

742
00:33:20,210 --> 00:33:21,710
And she wrapped it out.

743
00:33:21,750 --> 00:33:26,220
The sugarhill gang happened.
Like it was popular when I was in,

744
00:33:26,850 --> 00:33:30,450
I think I was in seventh or eighth 
grade,

745
00:33:30,630 --> 00:33:33,960
I think I was in seventh grade.
I'm not sure one of those.

746
00:33:34,260 --> 00:33:39,260
But when it happened,
I remember we were in the cafeteria and 

747
00:33:39,260 --> 00:33:40,140
somehow or another someone had a boombox
or something like that.

748
00:33:40,141 --> 00:33:42,960
And they were playing it in my junior 
high school when I was living in Jamaica

749
00:33:42,961 --> 00:33:45,690
Plain.
I went to a junior high school,

750
00:33:45,691 --> 00:33:49,020
was super sketchy,
like we had a,

751
00:33:49,110 --> 00:33:54,110
we'd lived in a very bad neighborhood 
and the Jamaica plain is kind of become 

752
00:33:54,110 --> 00:33:58,700
gentrified now a little bit,
but when I lived there like in 1979,

753
00:34:00,001 --> 00:34:03,150
1980,
I guess when I lived there it was shit.

754
00:34:03,180 --> 00:34:03,980
Yeah,
it was,

755
00:34:04,060 --> 00:34:09,060
it was not good.
And there was kids in our class when I 

756
00:34:09,060 --> 00:34:09,060
was,
I guess I,

757
00:34:09,060 --> 00:34:12,540
like I said I was 13 and there was a kid
in my class that was 17.

758
00:34:15,010 --> 00:34:20,010
And uh,
you're not cheating off him during a 

759
00:34:20,010 --> 00:34:20,010
quiz.
Yeah,

760
00:34:20,010 --> 00:34:22,860
it was weird.
Like he was there for the first couple 

761
00:34:22,860 --> 00:34:22,860
of days and then he left and then he 
quit again.

762
00:34:22,860 --> 00:34:24,190
You just never,
wow.

763
00:34:24,220 --> 00:34:29,220
Never stuck it out with school.
And he was there for a little while and 

764
00:34:29,220 --> 00:34:29,220
he bailed.
And I was like.

765
00:34:29,220 --> 00:34:33,870
And I remember the feeling of sadness 
and I remember a girl in my class was 

766
00:34:33,870 --> 00:34:34,870
kind of a Ho.
She was also a little bit older.

767
00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:38,680
She was a super 16 and she's a 13 year 
old class,

768
00:34:38,681 --> 00:34:40,390
right,
and she asked the teacher.

769
00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:46,200
She goes,
if you'll make out with someone and you 

770
00:34:46,200 --> 00:34:47,980
breathe out and they breathe it in and 
they breathe in,

771
00:34:48,030 --> 00:34:49,850
you breathe it in.
Do you need any more?

772
00:34:52,490 --> 00:34:54,620
Get fucking question.
It's not a bad question.

773
00:34:55,100 --> 00:34:56,750
I remember.
I remember thinking,

774
00:34:56,780 --> 00:34:58,620
man,
this bitch get fucked a lot.

775
00:35:02,670 --> 00:35:07,670
She's like,
I'm tired of regular an f only from 

776
00:35:07,670 --> 00:35:11,120
people who are fucking man.
If your uncle exhales and you.

777
00:35:11,580 --> 00:35:12,440
I mean,
you know,

778
00:35:12,441 --> 00:35:15,440
hypothetically,
not my uncle.

779
00:35:16,250 --> 00:35:20,090
Hypothetically,
if you in the basement and your uncle is

780
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:23,460
whispering into your mouth,
what a

781
00:35:23,500 --> 00:35:28,500
crazy question.
Like if you could just breathe each of 

782
00:35:28,500 --> 00:35:28,500
those air back and forth and the science
teacher who is.

783
00:35:28,500 --> 00:35:31,900
She asked a question to how to explain 
that you breathe out carbon dioxide.

784
00:35:32,220 --> 00:35:36,100
Then he was the first guy that really 
kind of blew my mind.

785
00:35:37,080 --> 00:35:39,090
I had one of those science teachers 
like,

786
00:35:39,091 --> 00:35:44,091
or any teacher,
like when you're really young that 

787
00:35:44,091 --> 00:35:46,131
actually make an impression.
I really wish I could remember this 

788
00:35:46,131 --> 00:35:47,490
guy's name,
but he was a Vietnam vet and um,

789
00:35:47,940 --> 00:35:48,990
he,
uh,

790
00:35:49,560 --> 00:35:50,200
he was,
uh,

791
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:53,220
a very interesting guy because he was 
very calm,

792
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:55,700
but people didn't fuck with them.
He was,

793
00:35:55,701 --> 00:35:58,290
he had this weird error,
but he had a beard,

794
00:35:58,350 --> 00:36:00,690
which I always thought was weird,
is back then people didn't have beards,

795
00:36:01,050 --> 00:36:02,820
hipster beard.
And uh,

796
00:36:03,360 --> 00:36:08,360
I remember he said,
if you really want to understand how 

797
00:36:08,360 --> 00:36:11,541
strange the world is,
just go outside and look up and 

798
00:36:12,420 --> 00:36:16,880
understand that there's no end to that,
that it goes on forever and just,

799
00:36:16,890 --> 00:36:21,890
you want to hurt your brain,
go outside and look up at the sky and 

800
00:36:21,890 --> 00:36:24,060
realize that space is infinite,
which means there's no end to it.

801
00:36:24,270 --> 00:36:26,010
I don't remember the whole class,
you know,

802
00:36:26,250 --> 00:36:28,460
2:16
year olds and the rest of us were like,

803
00:36:29,910 --> 00:36:32,040
which is sitting there like,
what the fuck?

804
00:36:32,580 --> 00:36:34,710
There's no end.
Like how come nobody ever explained that

805
00:36:34,711 --> 00:36:36,740
to me?
I never even thought about it before.

806
00:36:36,900 --> 00:36:39,780
I always knew that the universe is big.
I always new space was big.

807
00:36:40,050 --> 00:36:41,550
But when he said that like,
no,

808
00:36:41,551 --> 00:36:42,870
end,
like you start thinking,

809
00:36:42,871 --> 00:36:47,871
okay,
and then further and further and then 

810
00:36:47,871 --> 00:36:47,871
for and there's no,
there's no wall,

811
00:36:47,871 --> 00:36:48,340
there's no end.
Yeah.

812
00:36:49,310 --> 00:36:51,860
So they can't be an answer because it 
didn't come back.

813
00:36:51,861 --> 00:36:55,820
Whatever question you sent out there,
can't come back because it's still going

814
00:36:55,821 --> 00:37:00,821
out there.
It's like when I think about whether or 

815
00:37:00,821 --> 00:37:00,821
not,
whether or not there's a god that's,

816
00:37:00,821 --> 00:37:05,531
to me,
I just think of the word infinity and I 

817
00:37:05,531 --> 00:37:05,531
just think all right,
if we can,

818
00:37:05,531 --> 00:37:07,160
if science can ever grapple with that,
then I,

819
00:37:07,161 --> 00:37:09,890
then I'll believe that there's no god.
You believe it was gone?

820
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:10,840
Yeah.
Do you?

821
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:11,760
Yeah.
What do you believe?

822
00:37:11,890 --> 00:37:13,960
Like there's an old dude and a cloud or

823
00:37:14,010 --> 00:37:15,300
no,
nothing like that.

824
00:37:15,301 --> 00:37:16,140
I mean,
and I don't,

825
00:37:16,650 --> 00:37:21,330
I can't articulate it that well because 
I've never set out to make anybody agree

826
00:37:21,331 --> 00:37:26,331
with me.
It's just my own personal part of it is 

827
00:37:26,331 --> 00:37:28,170
I think I was raised very Irish Catholic
and you know,

828
00:37:28,171 --> 00:37:30,570
you uh,
you learn the 10 commandments.

829
00:37:31,420 --> 00:37:35,160
Thou shalt have no other gods before me.
And you know,

830
00:37:35,161 --> 00:37:40,161
you think about this force in the 
universe that has all the answers and I 

831
00:37:40,161 --> 00:37:41,340
don't know that like I ever fully let go
of that,

832
00:37:41,640 --> 00:37:43,310
but it morphed into Mike,
uh,

833
00:37:43,350 --> 00:37:45,450
kind of a,
like a taoist.

834
00:37:45,750 --> 00:37:50,750
There's an energy that flows,
like with nature and that all energy is 

835
00:37:50,750 --> 00:37:54,561
part of it.
And that your goal to achieve 

836
00:37:54,561 --> 00:37:55,410
enlightenment is to just become part of 
that energy.

837
00:37:55,411 --> 00:37:58,290
To let go and become part of it.
Like that to me is God,

838
00:37:58,291 --> 00:38:03,291
is that there,
there is something that has created the 

839
00:38:03,291 --> 00:38:07,641
initial physical laws of the universe 
and that those whatever happens within 

840
00:38:08,161 --> 00:38:13,161
that happens,
but that there was something that 

841
00:38:13,161 --> 00:38:16,400
engineered the,
the way that there are physiological 

842
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:19,680
reactions within an atom,
the same way there are in a universe and

843
00:38:19,681 --> 00:38:24,681
a mat.
I would imagine galaxies within the 

844
00:38:24,681 --> 00:38:27,231
universe all I'll behave the same way.
The Proton and electron work in a,

845
00:38:27,870 --> 00:38:28,470
in an atom.

846
00:38:29,030 --> 00:38:30,410
Well,
I think it's fractal.

847
00:38:30,470 --> 00:38:32,660
I think that's one of the things that 
they're starting to realize.

848
00:38:32,661 --> 00:38:36,400
No one will look into subatomic and they
try to understand

849
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:39,280
like what?
What's the relationship between atoms in

850
00:38:39,281 --> 00:38:43,600
the universe itself and I think as you 
go deeper and deeper and deeper,

851
00:38:43,601 --> 00:38:46,300
it starts to resemble the universe more 
and more.

852
00:38:46,690 --> 00:38:49,930
The universe is mostly empty space,
right?

853
00:38:50,020 --> 00:38:55,020
Black matter which way,
they don't necessarily totally 

854
00:38:55,020 --> 00:38:55,020
understand.
Yeah.

855
00:38:55,020 --> 00:38:58,750
Black binder is this weird thing that 
they're trying to figure out to try to.

856
00:38:59,710 --> 00:39:04,110
From the way it's been explained to me 
by physicists because I'm an idiot and I

857
00:39:04,120 --> 00:39:05,110
asked them.
I'm like,

858
00:39:05,111 --> 00:39:06,700
okay,
try to explain this to me.

859
00:39:07,600 --> 00:39:12,460
They don't know why these galaxies 
behave the way they do.

860
00:39:12,461 --> 00:39:17,461
They don't know why.
In one of the ways they have formulated 

861
00:39:17,461 --> 00:39:19,100
to try to make it make sense.
Yeah.

862
00:39:19,210 --> 00:39:24,210
Is this concept of dark matter?
He and they say with Einstein theory of 

863
00:39:24,210 --> 00:39:27,931
relativity that,
that it is the black matter that has an 

864
00:39:28,001 --> 00:39:33,001
effect on the way light bands and then 
we gravity acts upon things.

865
00:39:33,490 --> 00:39:38,490
Physicists or listen to this right now.
What are these fucking monkeys talking 

866
00:39:38,490 --> 00:39:38,940
about?
We're not even.

867
00:39:40,810 --> 00:39:42,490
We should get high and try to work this 
out.

868
00:39:42,870 --> 00:39:44,220
Oh,
like God.

869
00:39:44,650 --> 00:39:45,600
Yeah.
It's really,

870
00:39:45,690 --> 00:39:47,610
it really is intense because,
uh,

871
00:39:48,120 --> 00:39:48,700
you know,
when I'm,

872
00:39:48,820 --> 00:39:53,820
when I am feeling down,
I do start thinking about the big 

873
00:39:53,820 --> 00:39:54,220
question is just to shrink everything 
the fuck down.

874
00:39:54,790 --> 00:39:59,790
Well,
I don't know if the word God is serving 

875
00:39:59,790 --> 00:39:59,790
us.
You're right,

876
00:39:59,790 --> 00:40:00,970
you're right.
That's a problem.

877
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:02,230
Yeah.
I think it's a loaded,

878
00:40:02,231 --> 00:40:04,270
got a loaded word,
you know,

879
00:40:05,050 --> 00:40:07,660
it's like a,
it's got too much weight behind it.

880
00:40:07,720 --> 00:40:12,720
Yeah.
And also it's got so many meanings that 

881
00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:16,410
connect to religious fundamentalism,
ideologies that human beings have 

882
00:40:16,410 --> 00:40:17,560
obviously created,
you know,

883
00:40:17,561 --> 00:40:22,561
women wearing burkas and all kinds of 
wacky shit that's connected to these 

884
00:40:22,561 --> 00:40:25,120
concepts of religious ideology.
When you say the word God,

885
00:40:25,360 --> 00:40:30,360
you immediately sort of,
you have a bridge to these 

886
00:40:30,360 --> 00:40:30,360
fundamentalist ideas.

887
00:40:30,360 --> 00:40:31,180
Yeah.
And they're not that good.

888
00:40:31,810 --> 00:40:33,370
Yeah.
I think it's almost like,

889
00:40:33,700 --> 00:40:35,410
again,
going back to my Catholicism,

890
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:37,660
I guess it just became a replacement for
that,

891
00:40:38,200 --> 00:40:41,020
that concept,
but you're right.

892
00:40:41,021 --> 00:40:46,021
I think that is a,
there's a lot of stigma attached to it 

893
00:40:46,021 --> 00:40:46,750
and um,
you know,

894
00:40:46,810 --> 00:40:51,810
trying to,
trying to get somebody to agree with 

895
00:40:51,810 --> 00:40:51,820
your God is the thing that's always 
fascinated me.

896
00:40:51,821 --> 00:40:56,821
Like why?
Why do you need a bunch of people to 

897
00:40:56,821 --> 00:40:57,490
convert and kneel next to you and all 
have the same beliefs?

898
00:40:57,491 --> 00:41:00,580
Why can't you just have your 
understanding and be peaceful with it?

899
00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:02,920
That's how you know that veganism is a 
religion.

900
00:41:03,520 --> 00:41:05,260
Yeah.
Because they're all trying to get you to

901
00:41:05,261 --> 00:41:06,810
do it too.
They're all trying to get,

902
00:41:07,030 --> 00:41:08,910
we're going to save the world.
We want to.

903
00:41:08,920 --> 00:41:12,070
Polar bears are eating their kids saving
shit.

904
00:41:12,071 --> 00:41:12,730
Yeah.
Right.

905
00:41:12,790 --> 00:41:15,430
I mean the idea of stopping torture and 
stopping,

906
00:41:15,730 --> 00:41:16,810
you know,
a factory,

907
00:41:16,811 --> 00:41:18,310
farming,
these are all good things.

908
00:41:18,770 --> 00:41:21,370
The little less harm we can do is all a 
good thing,

909
00:41:21,730 --> 00:41:24,550
but there's something about that need to
convert people.

910
00:41:24,551 --> 00:41:28,090
There's something about that patronizing
attitude they have.

911
00:41:28,091 --> 00:41:33,091
There's something about this 
overwhelming desire to incorporate other

912
00:41:33,591 --> 00:41:34,130
people

913
00:41:34,130 --> 00:41:36,830
into their group that completely smacks 
of religion.

914
00:41:37,270 --> 00:41:37,520
Well you

915
00:41:37,710 --> 00:41:39,210
do that.
A Bikram Yoga,

916
00:41:39,211 --> 00:41:40,170
right?
Yeah.

917
00:41:40,171 --> 00:41:43,680
Cause I did a couple of classes and then
I found out it was a call harborside.

918
00:41:43,770 --> 00:41:47,250
They started trying to indoctrinate me 
into these long term contracts.

919
00:41:47,251 --> 00:41:49,140
I was like,
can I just come and pay you 22,

920
00:41:49,160 --> 00:41:52,760
500 and take the fucking class?
Do I have to agree with you spiritually?

921
00:41:52,761 --> 00:41:56,060
Also while they say crazy shit to like 
this,

922
00:41:56,200 --> 00:41:58,610
this supports your inverse colon and 
okay,

923
00:41:58,730 --> 00:42:01,940
can I see some documentation?
Can I ask you some medical studies?

924
00:42:02,420 --> 00:42:03,770
Like what the fuck are you talking 
about?

925
00:42:03,771 --> 00:42:08,771
Like a friend of mine teaches yoga and I
actually had a conversation with her 

926
00:42:08,771 --> 00:42:08,771
about it.
I'm like,

927
00:42:08,771 --> 00:42:09,170
you know,
teachers Baker my irregular.

928
00:42:09,171 --> 00:42:14,171
Yeah.
And I was like maybe some teachers 

929
00:42:14,171 --> 00:42:17,171
should probably stop saying these things
about like medical stuff because they 

930
00:42:17,171 --> 00:42:19,760
teach you that in Bikram Yoga,
like they teach you to say that,

931
00:42:20,150 --> 00:42:22,880
but bikram himself,
he's a fucking crook.

932
00:42:23,240 --> 00:42:28,240
He's a crazy con man and a cult leader 
and he's just got sued for like millions

933
00:42:29,540 --> 00:42:31,490
of dollars for sexual harassment and 
rape.

934
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:32,840
Yeah,
I mean he's like,

935
00:42:34,100 --> 00:42:37,520
it may mean allegedly a piece of shit,
you know,

936
00:42:37,521 --> 00:42:42,521
and he's the leader of this whole thing 
and somebody explained to me an extra 

937
00:42:42,521 --> 00:42:46,120
instructor explain to me why he teaches 
bikram yoga and he's like,

938
00:42:46,371 --> 00:42:48,470
look,
the method is very good.

939
00:42:48,680 --> 00:42:51,300
The method of doing it in the hot room,
100,

940
00:42:51,330 --> 00:42:54,200
four degrees,
the poses themselves in that order,

941
00:42:54,210 --> 00:42:59,210
the 90 minutes of them are excellent.
He goes 100 percent believe in the 

942
00:42:59,210 --> 00:43:02,951
method of it.
But the method wasn't even created by 

943
00:43:02,951 --> 00:43:02,951
beach grove.
That's right.

944
00:43:02,951 --> 00:43:03,530
It's created by another guy in the 
thirties.

945
00:43:03,531 --> 00:43:05,780
Yep.
And [inaudible] copywrote it.

946
00:43:05,781 --> 00:43:10,781
But he recently lost a court case where 
we see what happens is people get into 

947
00:43:11,571 --> 00:43:13,640
yoga,
they say I want to be spiritual,

948
00:43:13,641 --> 00:43:15,410
I want to be healthy.
And they started taking yoga.

949
00:43:15,620 --> 00:43:18,830
Then they find out about this beaker guy
and they go way the fuck.

950
00:43:18,860 --> 00:43:20,240
What the fuck is going on?
Man?

951
00:43:20,430 --> 00:43:22,640
He,
he recently got busted,

952
00:43:22,910 --> 00:43:23,430
right.
Were there,

953
00:43:23,431 --> 00:43:26,390
were there were like trying to like 
assess as assets because they were suing

954
00:43:26,391 --> 00:43:31,391
the shit out of him.
All these people that he tried to fuck 

955
00:43:31,391 --> 00:43:31,391
or whatever the hell he did,
allegedly,

956
00:43:31,391 --> 00:43:32,600
allegedly,
I don't want to get sued,

957
00:43:32,870 --> 00:43:33,770
but he,
they,

958
00:43:33,800 --> 00:43:38,800
they found he had a warehouse filled 
with like Rolls Royce's and Bentley's 

959
00:43:38,800 --> 00:43:43,751
and shit and he knows his explanation 
was he was going to start an engine in 

960
00:43:43,751 --> 00:43:48,100
automotive engineering school for 
children and that's why he got these 

961
00:43:48,100 --> 00:43:48,100
cars.

962
00:43:49,950 --> 00:43:52,350
That's his fucking explanation.
You got anything?

963
00:43:52,380 --> 00:43:52,700
Stand

964
00:43:52,740 --> 00:43:55,710
kids.
They want to work on large motors.

965
00:43:55,770 --> 00:43:58,710
Only Bentley's on and bentleys or into 
bling bling cars.

966
00:43:58,740 --> 00:44:00,540
Oh my God.
That's hilarious.

967
00:44:00,541 --> 00:44:01,480
Could dip shit.
Yeah.

968
00:44:02,220 --> 00:44:04,320
Oh yeah.
Well it's amazing because,

969
00:44:05,020 --> 00:44:06,930
you know,
Yoga is,

970
00:44:06,990 --> 00:44:09,210
it can be spiritual,
but it can also be like I,

971
00:44:09,211 --> 00:44:14,211
I used to go to this place called Yaz 
and Venice beach and it was yoga and 

972
00:44:14,211 --> 00:44:18,171
spinning together.
So you'd get on a spin bike for it was 

973
00:44:18,171 --> 00:44:21,411
perfect one hour,
30 minutes on a spin bike and then 30 

974
00:44:21,411 --> 00:44:24,471
minutes of like power yoga and you 
walked out with like a great cardio 

975
00:44:24,471 --> 00:44:27,801
workout stretched out and they didn't 
utter a word about anything spiritual 

976
00:44:27,801 --> 00:44:32,331
because it was sort of like the antidote
to like be chrome where they're trying 

977
00:44:32,331 --> 00:44:32,331
suck you into something.

978
00:44:32,850 --> 00:44:36,360
But I miss,
I miss that little Vinyasa at the end.

979
00:44:36,361 --> 00:44:41,361
I like a little bit of like a meditation
that's led in a really simple way 

980
00:44:41,361 --> 00:44:46,040
because it's like you're already in that
almost sub rem state and then physically

981
00:44:46,111 --> 00:44:48,000
you can.
It's just so much easier to go into that

982
00:44:48,001 --> 00:44:49,920
mental you like you've really earned 
that,

983
00:44:50,400 --> 00:44:55,400
that a meditation.
Well it's 90 minutes to 90 minutes is 

984
00:44:55,400 --> 00:44:56,210
fucking hard to do.
Yeah.

985
00:44:56,340 --> 00:45:00,330
It's hard to do a 90 minute class at 104
degrees restructured now.

986
00:45:00,630 --> 00:45:03,210
But what I find one of the big benefits 
of it,

987
00:45:03,360 --> 00:45:06,060
not just physical because there's a 
massive physical benefits.

988
00:45:06,061 --> 00:45:11,061
First of all,
my back feels amazing since I've been 

989
00:45:11,061 --> 00:45:11,061
doing it.
I've been doing,

990
00:45:11,061 --> 00:45:13,830
it's like real steady every week since 
about August,

991
00:45:14,040 --> 00:45:16,290
somewhere around where it was when I 
started.

992
00:45:16,620 --> 00:45:18,870
You do it once a week,
sometimes twice a week,

993
00:45:19,020 --> 00:45:22,230
but mostly once a week,
but I'm going to try to do three times a

994
00:45:22,231 --> 00:45:24,990
week what I'm going to try to do now 
because of A.

995
00:45:25,170 --> 00:45:30,170
I've dedicated myself to this new diet 
and I talked about it a lot and one of 

996
00:45:30,170 --> 00:45:34,611
the things I found out is if you talk 
about something like on a podcast and 

997
00:45:34,611 --> 00:45:34,611
you say,
hey,

998
00:45:34,611 --> 00:45:36,660
for the next 60 days,
I'm not going to have any added sugar.

999
00:45:36,661 --> 00:45:37,800
No grains,
no this,

1000
00:45:37,801 --> 00:45:38,580
no that,
like,

1001
00:45:38,581 --> 00:45:40,290
you just do it because you've already 
said it.

1002
00:45:40,380 --> 00:45:45,380
And then other people hear it.
You know the people that listen to the 

1003
00:45:45,380 --> 00:45:45,380
podcast.
I go,

1004
00:45:45,380 --> 00:45:45,380
oh,
well if I can try that too.

1005
00:45:45,380 --> 00:45:50,030
And then I hear about all the benefits 
these people are having from the Diet 

1006
00:45:50,030 --> 00:45:50,030
and then I'm like,
all right,

1007
00:45:50,030 --> 00:45:50,850
well I'm going to just.
Because if it was just me,

1008
00:45:50,851 --> 00:45:51,420
if I said,
oh,

1009
00:45:51,421 --> 00:45:56,421
I'll give this a shot,
and then I passed by some place with a 

1010
00:45:56,421 --> 00:45:56,421
chocolate croissant.
I'm like,

1011
00:45:56,421 --> 00:45:56,520
fuck it,
give me that.

1012
00:45:56,550 --> 00:45:56,920
Yeah,
no,

1013
00:45:56,930 --> 00:45:58,230
but I can't,
so I'm not doing it.

1014
00:45:58,270 --> 00:46:01,080
So um,
so when these other people follow,

1015
00:46:01,260 --> 00:46:06,260
yeah,
and soon you're going to have a fucking 

1016
00:46:06,260 --> 00:46:06,260
fleet of Rolls Royces.
My coach free,

1017
00:46:07,530 --> 00:46:09,300
no entry fecally,
whatever you want.

1018
00:46:09,420 --> 00:46:11,190
Youtube cult.
But the,

1019
00:46:11,430 --> 00:46:14,580
my ideas that I'm going to commit to 
doing it three days a week because three

1020
00:46:14,581 --> 00:46:16,920
days a week it's fucking hard for me.
It's very difficult.

1021
00:46:16,921 --> 00:46:20,610
So I'm going to do 60 days of three days
a week to see how that feels.

1022
00:46:20,640 --> 00:46:22,920
But the tough thing is I found when I 
did it,

1023
00:46:23,250 --> 00:46:28,250
I couldn't do shit.
I had like two spots that night and I 

1024
00:46:28,250 --> 00:46:30,000
was still not 100 percent.
I was a little lightheaded still.

1025
00:46:30,060 --> 00:46:35,060
Well we probably need to rehydrate.
You probably needed more water and also 

1026
00:46:35,060 --> 00:46:36,360
electrolytes.
Somebody telling me got to get a lot of.

1027
00:46:36,900 --> 00:46:39,360
Yeah,
you sweat a lot and 100,

1028
00:46:39,361 --> 00:46:42,390
four degrees,
you're poor and sweat pouring at the end

1029
00:46:42,390 --> 00:46:42,540
of it.

1030
00:46:42,540 --> 00:46:46,110
I mean I'm fucking drenched and I have 
this huge,

1031
00:46:46,200 --> 00:46:50,340
like a thermos that I fill with ice and 
water before the class.

1032
00:46:50,341 --> 00:46:51,030
Yeah.
The end of it.

1033
00:46:51,031 --> 00:46:52,040
It's empty.
Yeah.

1034
00:46:52,210 --> 00:46:57,210
The uh,
the idea that I could drink that much 

1035
00:46:57,210 --> 00:46:57,210
water in 90 minutes.
It's crazy.

1036
00:46:57,210 --> 00:46:57,210
Yeah.
And the idea that it just,

1037
00:46:57,210 --> 00:47:00,420
I just go right through it.
It's just so hot in there.

1038
00:47:00,450 --> 00:47:04,950
But the benefits for your body or 
definitely legit,

1039
00:47:04,980 --> 00:47:07,800
like my flexibility is fantastic right 
now.

1040
00:47:07,801 --> 00:47:12,801
My back feels amazing and the big one 
though is how shit his rolls off your 

1041
00:47:14,191 --> 00:47:15,270
back.
Yeah,

1042
00:47:15,300 --> 00:47:19,440
like things don't bother me the way they
would bother me if I wasn't doing it.

1043
00:47:19,500 --> 00:47:20,860
No Shit.
Yeah,

1044
00:47:20,870 --> 00:47:22,050
it's,
it's amazing.

1045
00:47:22,340 --> 00:47:25,170
One of the example uses this guy rear 
ended my car,

1046
00:47:25,350 --> 00:47:27,780
my Porsche.
While you were at a stoplight.

1047
00:47:27,810 --> 00:47:29,470
No,
even worse was a,

1048
00:47:29,471 --> 00:47:30,670
there was a construction

1049
00:47:30,670 --> 00:47:32,850
on the highway and this guy wasn't 
fucking paying attention.

1050
00:47:32,860 --> 00:47:35,620
He was looking at his phone and he was 
from Mexico.

1051
00:47:35,650 --> 00:47:40,390
No driver's license,
illegal slams on his brakes,

1052
00:47:40,480 --> 00:47:44,170
plows into me with his Honda Civic,
just wrecks his car.

1053
00:47:44,171 --> 00:47:47,440
His car was totaled.
My car was actually not that bad.

1054
00:47:47,620 --> 00:47:52,620
They just had to replace because 
Porsche's actually design their cars it 

1055
00:47:52,620 --> 00:47:56,250
incredibly well,
and they have this collision bar behind 

1056
00:47:56,250 --> 00:48:00,421
the engine that accordions when it gets 
hit and he completely protected the 

1057
00:48:00,421 --> 00:48:00,421
engine.
Oh Shit.

1058
00:48:00,421 --> 00:48:02,120
Yeah.
So it was only like a two week fixed.

1059
00:48:02,470 --> 00:48:05,320
I sent it back to shark works in 
northern California.

1060
00:48:05,350 --> 00:48:06,430
They,
they fixed it.

1061
00:48:06,431 --> 00:48:08,370
I had it back in two weeks.
Good as no,

1062
00:48:08,520 --> 00:48:10,590
but no compensation from the other 
driver.

1063
00:48:10,670 --> 00:48:12,390
Uh,
allegedly,

1064
00:48:12,391 --> 00:48:13,330
uh,
some insurance,

1065
00:48:13,950 --> 00:48:16,610
but most likely no.
But the thing is,

1066
00:48:16,611 --> 00:48:19,670
man,
what I saw the guy hit his,

1067
00:48:19,760 --> 00:48:21,560
I looked at him,
he wasn't paying attention.

1068
00:48:21,561 --> 00:48:22,760
I looked at him,
look up,

1069
00:48:22,761 --> 00:48:24,750
I saw the look in his eyes,
you know,

1070
00:48:24,751 --> 00:48:29,751
like,
you realize like right before he hits 

1071
00:48:29,751 --> 00:48:29,751
this fucking guy,
he slammed on his brakes right before he

1072
00:48:29,751 --> 00:48:34,691
hit.
And luckily he wasn't going too fast 

1073
00:48:34,691 --> 00:48:34,970
because traffic was going kind of slow.
But um,

1074
00:48:35,570 --> 00:48:38,600
I got out and I wasn't upset.
It was weird.

1075
00:48:38,730 --> 00:48:41,680
When I fucking love that car.
I mean,

1076
00:48:41,690 --> 00:48:44,030
it is a rare car.
There's very few of them.

1077
00:48:44,180 --> 00:48:47,120
You can't get them anymore.
Like if you buy them,

1078
00:48:47,121 --> 00:48:50,330
they're extremely hard to find and mine 
is really rare because it's,

1079
00:48:50,570 --> 00:48:53,430
it was done by shark works with this 
company in Northern California,

1080
00:48:53,431 --> 00:48:55,280
a tell me about shit to it.
So,

1081
00:48:55,310 --> 00:48:57,890
but I got out and the first thing I did,
I go up to my ego,

1082
00:48:57,891 --> 00:48:58,460
you okay?

1083
00:48:59,000 --> 00:48:59,900
And he's like,
yeah,

1084
00:48:59,901 --> 00:49:00,500
yeah,
I'm okay.

1085
00:49:00,501 --> 00:49:01,190
I'm like,
okay.

1086
00:49:01,220 --> 00:49:03,560
Well we were both okay.
And I swear to God,

1087
00:49:03,561 --> 00:49:04,670
man,
I wasn't even upset.

1088
00:49:05,120 --> 00:49:07,130
I was not upset.
I was like level.

1089
00:49:07,220 --> 00:49:12,220
And it was because I did yoga that day 
and I had done it another day that week 

1090
00:49:12,220 --> 00:49:12,970
that I was just,
I was on my way to the store that was,

1091
00:49:12,980 --> 00:49:15,890
was worried about was I was going to 
miss my spot because uh,

1092
00:49:15,950 --> 00:49:16,960
you know,
I'm,

1093
00:49:17,980 --> 00:49:22,980
I usually give myself like I like to get
there like 20 minutes before and I'm 

1094
00:49:22,980 --> 00:49:22,980
like,
this might fuck me up,

1095
00:49:22,980 --> 00:49:27,490
you know.
But I really attribute that to just the,

1096
00:49:27,920 --> 00:49:32,750
there's a balance that you get from 
doing something like that where you're,

1097
00:49:32,780 --> 00:49:36,110
you're exerting yourself extremely hard 
for 90 minutes.

1098
00:49:36,111 --> 00:49:41,111
It's so fucking difficult and most 
people don't know you passed by Yoga 

1099
00:49:41,111 --> 00:49:45,490
Studios,
you look in there and he got a bunch of 

1100
00:49:45,490 --> 00:49:47,111
housewives playing with their feet and 
they're not doing anything but it's 

1101
00:49:47,111 --> 00:49:50,620
fucking.
It's a struggle and it's a mental 

1102
00:49:50,620 --> 00:49:50,620
struggle.

1103
00:49:50,620 --> 00:49:50,620
Yeah.
You break through some walls for sure.

1104
00:49:50,620 --> 00:49:55,251
And the thing is is I remember I used to
take it up in San Francisco and for 

1105
00:49:55,621 --> 00:49:56,970
years,
this is 10,

1106
00:49:56,980 --> 00:49:59,100
15 years ago,
he's taken up in San Francisco.

1107
00:49:59,101 --> 00:50:01,740
I don't know if it was beef from back 
then or it was just hot yoga,

1108
00:50:02,310 --> 00:50:06,420
but when I tried to leave the studio 
because I felt dizzy and nauseous.

1109
00:50:06,930 --> 00:50:09,360
Every one of the classes like no you can
do.

1110
00:50:09,361 --> 00:50:12,690
It seems like they really encourage you 
to breakthrough to get.

1111
00:50:12,691 --> 00:50:14,660
It's like a team effort to get through 
it.

1112
00:50:14,770 --> 00:50:19,770
There's a lot of support in that because
if you're by yourself and you've 

1113
00:50:19,770 --> 00:50:19,770
experienced that same feeling,
you usually like,

1114
00:50:19,770 --> 00:50:20,680
oh,
stop right here.

1115
00:50:20,681 --> 00:50:21,550
Yeah,
relaxed,

1116
00:50:21,551 --> 00:50:23,830
but you can't stop because everything's 
timed.

1117
00:50:24,010 --> 00:50:29,010
The teachers timing it and they're,
they're gonna push you through and 

1118
00:50:29,010 --> 00:50:32,291
everyone else in the class is doing it.
It's a 60 year old lady right next to 

1119
00:50:32,291 --> 00:50:32,291
me.
She's doing it.

1120
00:50:32,291 --> 00:50:32,470
How come I can't do it?
Right?

1121
00:50:32,610 --> 00:50:37,610
We all experienced the same thing and 
you realize that's the thing about yoga 

1122
00:50:37,610 --> 00:50:41,171
is like maybe one person might be able 
to lift a heavier weight than this 

1123
00:50:41,171 --> 00:50:41,870
person or they might be able to run 
faster,

1124
00:50:42,020 --> 00:50:47,020
but the effort that a 60 year old person
puts in versus a 20 year old person is 

1125
00:50:47,570 --> 00:50:52,570
the same because it's 100 percent.
You're putting in 100 percent effort to 

1126
00:50:52,570 --> 00:50:55,961
move your body so you might be able to 
move more or have more flexibility than 

1127
00:50:56,661 --> 00:51:01,661
another person,
but the amount of effort you put in is 

1128
00:51:01,661 --> 00:51:01,661
the same.
Yeah.

1129
00:51:01,661 --> 00:51:03,560
So class is never easy because it's 
always 100 percent effort,

1130
00:51:03,950 --> 00:51:06,320
so it's always fucking difficult.

1131
00:51:06,760 --> 00:51:08,300
Well,
and my friend explained to me,

1132
00:51:08,301 --> 00:51:13,301
I didn't realize this,
but that each pose is working at 

1133
00:51:13,301 --> 00:51:16,141
different Oregon,
that you're cleaning out your 

1134
00:51:16,141 --> 00:51:16,141
progressing,

1135
00:51:16,680 --> 00:51:18,530
pressing any fucking Oregon's.
What do you want?

1136
00:51:18,531 --> 00:51:22,050
Machine,
annual vice compressing your Oregon.

1137
00:51:22,120 --> 00:51:24,180
You toothpaste.
You're stretching and holding it.

1138
00:51:24,181 --> 00:51:25,110
Yeah.
That's what you're doing.

1139
00:51:25,150 --> 00:51:27,270
Why you're pushing your body.
I mean,

1140
00:51:27,271 --> 00:51:30,540
I'm sure there's some sort of benefits 
to your Oregon,

1141
00:51:30,740 --> 00:51:35,740
you know,
because there's benefits all your 

1142
00:51:35,740 --> 00:51:35,740
muscles,
your circulation is pumping,

1143
00:51:35,740 --> 00:51:37,980
you're sweating like crazy.
It's probably a lot of benefits.

1144
00:51:38,430 --> 00:51:40,950
How would you describe the smell of a 
beak from Yoga Room?

1145
00:51:41,250 --> 00:51:44,500
Like a foot under arm,
butthole,

1146
00:51:44,670 --> 00:51:49,670
Vagina,
and then a lot of like anti fungal spray

1147
00:51:50,211 --> 00:51:51,960
is.
And a lot of,

1148
00:51:51,961 --> 00:51:52,890
um,
you know,

1149
00:51:53,190 --> 00:51:56,580
deodorants and like whatever the fuck 
they are using to clean it.

1150
00:51:56,640 --> 00:51:57,480
Whatever detergent.

1151
00:51:57,660 --> 00:51:59,430
Yeah.
You need to let go into the smell.

1152
00:51:59,431 --> 00:52:03,030
A little bit tail at first.
That's a wall you get through as well.

1153
00:52:03,060 --> 00:52:08,060
The place I go to,
they do a great job of cleaning the 

1154
00:52:08,060 --> 00:52:10,371
carpets and vacuuming,
but heartbeats frankly shouldn't be a 

1155
00:52:10,371 --> 00:52:10,371
carpet,
right?

1156
00:52:10,371 --> 00:52:13,560
Damn hardwood floor.
But it's too slippery.

1157
00:52:13,860 --> 00:52:16,920
Hardwood floors get super slippery and 
people follow him.

1158
00:52:16,930 --> 00:52:21,090
Fucking rip their knees apart.
I took a shower afterwards and uh,

1159
00:52:21,630 --> 00:52:22,620
usually,
you know,

1160
00:52:22,630 --> 00:52:24,810
I'm always self conscious in a shower.
I just,

1161
00:52:24,830 --> 00:52:27,780
I've nudity it was just not part of my 
upbringing at all.

1162
00:52:27,990 --> 00:52:31,010
I think again,
Irish Catholic shame and uh,

1163
00:52:31,320 --> 00:52:33,840
but my dick was hanging low with that 
heat.

1164
00:52:33,841 --> 00:52:37,770
It looked good.
My balls were fucking just swing.

1165
00:52:37,771 --> 00:52:38,010
And

1166
00:52:38,600 --> 00:52:43,600
is it funny that your Dick especially 
your balls literally stretches to get 

1167
00:52:43,600 --> 00:52:47,621
the fuck away from your body?
Like this guy's already eat and let's 

1168
00:52:47,621 --> 00:52:47,621
get out.

1169
00:52:48,750 --> 00:52:51,230
This is to hold back there.
Get away from the asshole.

1170
00:52:52,160 --> 00:52:54,410
Yeah.
And then when it's cold at hides because

1171
00:52:54,411 --> 00:52:56,630
we got to fucking let us in.
Let us in.

1172
00:52:56,870 --> 00:53:01,870
This is one Weirdo who goes to my yoga 
class and he always looks at me like I 

1173
00:53:01,870 --> 00:53:02,960
stole something from him.
Like I don't even know you man.

1174
00:53:03,070 --> 00:53:08,070
I didn't do anything.
I always say hi to him and he's always 

1175
00:53:08,070 --> 00:53:08,070
like reluctant to say hide back when he 
comes out of the shower.

1176
00:53:08,070 --> 00:53:10,550
He cups his balls and his Dick and no 
one can see.

1177
00:53:10,640 --> 00:53:11,340
Really?
Yeah.

1178
00:53:11,500 --> 00:53:13,040
Like there's something wrong with this 
guy.

1179
00:53:13,280 --> 00:53:16,280
Well he can cup your both balls and your
Dick with one hand.

1180
00:53:16,310 --> 00:53:17,300
Yeah,
he's got it.

1181
00:53:17,390 --> 00:53:19,580
I can see why he doesn't want you to see
it but it.

1182
00:53:19,700 --> 00:53:22,400
But it's also like he,
he looks at other men,

1183
00:53:22,401 --> 00:53:23,660
like they did something to him.

1184
00:53:23,660 --> 00:53:28,660
Like I've seen him,
I've watched interact with other men 

1185
00:53:28,660 --> 00:53:28,660
too.
It's like,

1186
00:53:28,660 --> 00:53:28,660
what happened to you,
dude?

1187
00:53:28,750 --> 00:53:31,320
This guy just said hi to you and you'll 
let you looked at him like he just stole

1188
00:53:31,321 --> 00:53:33,060
your fucking girlfriend or something.
It's weird.

1189
00:53:33,360 --> 00:53:36,060
It's like sometimes I was just down the 
road,

1190
00:53:36,061 --> 00:53:36,630
uh,
in uh,

1191
00:53:36,631 --> 00:53:38,430
in Addison and you know,
these guys from Texas,

1192
00:53:38,431 --> 00:53:42,120
they come up and they're like,
they got on the crisp polo shirt and the

1193
00:53:42,121 --> 00:53:43,350
fucking,
you know,

1194
00:53:43,400 --> 00:53:46,020
slacks with pleats and the tassels on 
there.

1195
00:53:46,021 --> 00:53:51,021
Yeah.
And they're real crew cut and they're 

1196
00:53:51,021 --> 00:53:51,090
fucking built.
And this guy comes up and he right in my

1197
00:53:51,091 --> 00:53:52,650
face,
like grabs my hand is like,

1198
00:53:52,820 --> 00:53:54,150
how are you doing?
And I go,

1199
00:53:54,151 --> 00:53:55,140
I go,
it's okay.

1200
00:53:55,141 --> 00:53:58,920
I don't need to buy any insurance today.
Like I get urine Alpha.

1201
00:53:59,120 --> 00:54:00,540
You're an alpha.
You're not gay.

1202
00:54:00,541 --> 00:54:02,790
I got it.
Take it easy on my hands.

1203
00:54:04,860 --> 00:54:08,890
Nice fellow.
So slip on loafers.

1204
00:54:09,140 --> 00:54:14,140
Yeah.
People are still buying those double 

1205
00:54:14,140 --> 00:54:15,150
tassels.
Little bells.

1206
00:54:15,360 --> 00:54:17,640
Fucking weird things.
What are those?

1207
00:54:17,641 --> 00:54:20,580
The little octopuses that are hanging 
from the body,

1208
00:54:20,730 --> 00:54:23,420
they don't look good.
They look stupid,

1209
00:54:24,070 --> 00:54:26,030
but they're so common.
I know.

1210
00:54:26,070 --> 00:54:30,840
It's like there's a style that got 
created and just stay stuck with it.

1211
00:54:30,860 --> 00:54:32,540
Right.
Like ties.

1212
00:54:32,930 --> 00:54:35,820
He had ties the whole idea of dangling a
piece of,

1213
00:54:35,850 --> 00:54:37,320
uh,
of material from,

1214
00:54:37,321 --> 00:54:38,160
in front of you.
Yeah.

1215
00:54:38,161 --> 00:54:40,170
There they are.
Oh my God.

1216
00:54:40,171 --> 00:54:43,380
And it's always the.
Why is it always with no socks?

1217
00:54:43,890 --> 00:54:44,760
I don't know,
man.

1218
00:54:44,830 --> 00:54:47,390
And so these guys with little feet,
you got us.

1219
00:54:47,490 --> 00:54:49,740
Your feet must stink in those things at 
a stank.

1220
00:54:49,741 --> 00:54:50,640
There's no.
Yeah,

1221
00:54:50,641 --> 00:54:52,200
there's no way or getting into those 
things.

1222
00:54:52,310 --> 00:54:53,580
Yeah.
It's leather.

1223
00:54:53,670 --> 00:54:56,250
Leather.
You're sweaty ass feet with no socks.

1224
00:54:56,370 --> 00:54:59,670
It's almost like what you'd see like a 
bagpiper where that's.

1225
00:54:59,990 --> 00:55:01,840
It's a weird fetish.
Yeah.

1226
00:55:02,910 --> 00:55:04,460
Oh yeah.
Okay.

1227
00:55:04,461 --> 00:55:05,730
Is this okay?
Dork?

1228
00:55:06,950 --> 00:55:11,950
He's texting his girlfriend.
She's getting stuffed with some other 

1229
00:55:11,950 --> 00:55:11,950
dude.
Just gorilla fucked by.

1230
00:55:11,950 --> 00:55:15,060
Some guy she met at the gym while he's 
out there getting a manicure.

1231
00:55:15,350 --> 00:55:16,560
Well,
I was going to go to the gym,

1232
00:55:16,561 --> 00:55:19,070
but my nails are horrendous.
So,

1233
00:55:19,080 --> 00:55:20,730
um,
I'll call you later.

1234
00:55:20,731 --> 00:55:25,731
We're still gonna.
Do the topless bar and she's just 

1235
00:55:25,731 --> 00:55:26,430
getting stuff.
What are you going to wear by the way?

1236
00:55:26,431 --> 00:55:28,670
I want to make sure it matches what I'm 
wearing.

1237
00:55:29,010 --> 00:55:30,570
Don't wear blue because I'm wearing 
blue.

1238
00:55:32,060 --> 00:55:33,390
I'm dressed as Alan,
too generous.

1239
00:55:35,540 --> 00:55:40,420
Alan's wife.
I'm just as poor skin dorothy.

1240
00:55:41,650 --> 00:55:43,740
Oh yeah,
that's beautiful.

1241
00:55:43,860 --> 00:55:45,600
That's great.
The um,

1242
00:55:45,720 --> 00:55:47,750
and he only fucks her up the ass.
That's,

1243
00:55:47,810 --> 00:55:49,680
that's when you're going to wonder why 
you think so.

1244
00:55:50,320 --> 00:55:52,470
I like that.
He's just a really.

1245
00:55:52,680 --> 00:55:53,340
Yeah,
that's a,

1246
00:55:53,410 --> 00:55:58,410
she.
She's only taking up the smes always 

1247
00:55:58,410 --> 00:55:59,130
like got his hand in front of her pussy 
and he's Jack ended up and down.

1248
00:55:59,131 --> 00:56:00,090
She's like,
what are you doing?

1249
00:56:00,720 --> 00:56:03,810
You're really specific here.
And Eric,

1250
00:56:03,811 --> 00:56:04,620
caulk that.
You're chicken.

1251
00:56:04,630 --> 00:56:08,220
I'll put my tassels on it.
Need my tonsils were my little first.

1252
00:56:08,600 --> 00:56:10,170
I want to feel like we're fucking at the
office.

1253
00:56:10,171 --> 00:56:14,220
You don't even work in an office.
Want to.

1254
00:56:14,430 --> 00:56:16,620
Don't fuck up the fantasy.
You're normal.

1255
00:56:16,680 --> 00:56:19,770
I want to be the executive,
the executive.

1256
00:56:21,390 --> 00:56:22,930
I'm sexually harassing.
I want you to assume me.

1257
00:56:23,080 --> 00:56:24,280
I'm fucking.
You were fucking.

1258
00:56:24,280 --> 00:56:26,230
Because they're kind of promotion.
You don't even have a job.

1259
00:56:26,890 --> 00:56:30,040
I got a promotion today,
stop running a promotion,

1260
00:56:30,160 --> 00:56:35,160
you get a trust fund.
That world and that world that most 

1261
00:56:35,160 --> 00:56:38,491
people who are listening to this are 
stuck in that world of like trying to 

1262
00:56:38,491 --> 00:56:41,971
get a promotion,
trying to move your way up the company 

1263
00:56:41,971 --> 00:56:41,971
ladder,
going to company meetings,

1264
00:56:42,040 --> 00:56:47,040
hundreds of people all getting together,
wives and husbands and fucking shaking 

1265
00:56:47,040 --> 00:56:51,871
hands and wearing your loafers,
loafers and trying to figure out what 

1266
00:56:51,970 --> 00:56:56,800
church you're supposed to go to to get 
ahead what country club to join once she

1267
00:56:56,801 --> 00:56:59,020
gets to that next level.
Country Club.

1268
00:56:59,050 --> 00:57:02,290
I looked at houses in.
Do you know where Lake Sherwood is now?

1269
00:57:02,680 --> 00:57:06,220
Lake Sherwood is an area like way out 
near like thousand oaks.

1270
00:57:06,280 --> 00:57:11,280
Really Nice,
really nice place and it's a giant 

1271
00:57:11,280 --> 00:57:12,250
country club,
like a gated community country club.

1272
00:57:12,790 --> 00:57:16,260
And uh,
we looked at a house there and um,

1273
00:57:16,660 --> 00:57:18,410
when we're there it's like,
like what?

1274
00:57:18,440 --> 00:57:19,940
Like,
what is this place like?

1275
00:57:19,980 --> 00:57:22,000
This is like,
what's going on in this place?

1276
00:57:22,240 --> 00:57:26,140
It's all like people who go there and 
they play golf because it's like you,

1277
00:57:26,220 --> 00:57:29,140
you to sign up and be a part of the golf
thing.

1278
00:57:29,590 --> 00:57:33,040
The golf costs like some insane amount 
of money a year.

1279
00:57:33,490 --> 00:57:36,490
Like really stupid money.
Like pull that up,

1280
00:57:36,491 --> 00:57:38,590
find out how much lake shirt and they're
not going to list it.

1281
00:57:38,591 --> 00:57:43,591
A country club,
but I think it's like a quarter million 

1282
00:57:43,591 --> 00:57:43,591
dollars a year.
Yeah,

1283
00:57:43,591 --> 00:57:43,660
like something stupid.
I might be wrong.

1284
00:57:43,990 --> 00:57:45,490
Maybe it's 50 grand or something like 
that,

1285
00:57:45,730 --> 00:57:47,290
but it's something something where you 
like,

1286
00:57:47,300 --> 00:57:51,950
what were they just trying to keep out?
Anybody who's not stupid wealth,

1287
00:57:51,970 --> 00:57:53,330
right?
Does it say it?

1288
00:57:53,370 --> 00:57:56,150
Say how much?
One hundred and 85,000

1289
00:57:56,320 --> 00:58:01,320
they list.
I thought this clubs would keep that on 

1290
00:58:01,320 --> 00:58:01,320
the download on their website.

1291
00:58:01,320 --> 00:58:04,440
It's the article I found $185,000.
If you want to play golf because think 

1292
00:58:04,440 --> 00:58:08,670
about if you're a billionaire one 85 
doesn't mean shit to you except that 

1293
00:58:08,670 --> 00:58:10,960
people without it can't get in.
You know,

1294
00:58:10,961 --> 00:58:13,000
it's not,
it's not affecting your bottom line.

1295
00:58:13,030 --> 00:58:15,130
It's just an insurance policy.
You know,

1296
00:58:15,131 --> 00:58:16,300
like,
and then you see these clubs,

1297
00:58:16,301 --> 00:58:19,720
like there's a club in Santa Monica,
I forget which one it is,

1298
00:58:19,721 --> 00:58:23,110
but you drive past it.
There's never anybody on the chorus.

1299
00:58:23,111 --> 00:58:25,960
This is,
this is a miles.

1300
00:58:26,080 --> 00:58:27,700
Think about the real estate in Santa 
Monica.

1301
00:58:27,701 --> 00:58:32,410
If you had a 3000 square foot store,
you'd be paying,

1302
00:58:32,590 --> 00:58:34,480
you know,
$10,000

1303
00:58:34,481 --> 00:58:36,760
a month for it.
Now take that store,

1304
00:58:36,990 --> 00:58:41,860
step it into a golf course that square 
miles in that same neighborhood.

1305
00:58:42,160 --> 00:58:45,490
What does that possibly work?
And there's nobody playing on the course

1306
00:58:45,670 --> 00:58:47,890
to insane.
It's insane.

1307
00:58:48,160 --> 00:58:50,140
And the amount of water.
Oh yeah,

1308
00:58:50,350 --> 00:58:52,720
the sheer amount of water that gets used
by golf courses,

1309
00:58:52,721 --> 00:58:54,160
like they did a,
um,

1310
00:58:54,490 --> 00:58:59,490
they had a chart that showed all the 
water that's being used by residential 

1311
00:58:59,490 --> 00:59:04,350
people in houses and you know,
regular folks versus agriculture and 

1312
00:59:05,200 --> 00:59:07,960
agriculture is just staggering how much 
water they use.

1313
00:59:08,320 --> 00:59:12,760
But the really nutty one was millions 
and millions of gallons.

1314
00:59:12,880 --> 00:59:16,420
How many millions are being used by golf
courses just in southern California,

1315
00:59:16,480 --> 00:59:16,840
right?
I mean,

1316
00:59:16,841 --> 00:59:20,140
it's like a significant percentage of 
our water usage is golf.

1317
00:59:20,200 --> 00:59:21,740
Yeah.
Yeah.

1318
00:59:21,741 --> 00:59:22,040
And

1319
00:59:22,040 --> 00:59:23,420
uh,
they write off the land,

1320
00:59:23,421 --> 00:59:28,421
they don't have to pay taxes on it as 
much as normally because they call it 

1321
00:59:28,421 --> 00:59:28,421
you're ready for this.
It's like a,

1322
00:59:28,421 --> 00:59:29,300
uh,
it's,

1323
00:59:29,360 --> 00:59:34,360
it's considered wildlife walk.
Like every city is supposed to have 

1324
00:59:34,701 --> 00:59:37,840
zoned out a certain amount of 
undeveloped land for the environment.

1325
00:59:37,950 --> 00:59:40,300
Oh,
golf courses were able to loophole their

1326
00:59:40,310 --> 00:59:44,420
way into that so they don't pay them.
It's a wallet preserve,

1327
00:59:44,500 --> 00:59:45,680
right?
It's for squirrels.

1328
00:59:47,540 --> 00:59:52,540
Squirrels with click and bumps on their 
head from getting hit by golf ball 

1329
00:59:52,830 --> 00:59:55,720
scrolls had been marked by a fucking 
blind drive.

1330
00:59:56,500 --> 01:00:01,500
Imagine if you're in squirrel,
just hit golf ball bigger than your head

1331
01:00:03,260 --> 01:00:06,830
comes 75 miles an hour.
It's like,

1332
01:00:06,840 --> 01:00:07,400
wait,
dawn's,

1333
01:00:07,401 --> 01:00:09,470
you and Darwin didn't teach me about 
this.

1334
01:00:09,471 --> 01:00:14,471
How do I react to this in nature?
My friend Ryan got hit in the head by a 

1335
01:00:14,471 --> 01:00:15,410
long drive and he said he was fucked up 
for six months.

1336
01:00:15,410 --> 01:00:18,080
Really six months.
He had massive headaches,

1337
01:00:18,140 --> 01:00:23,140
so fucking hard ball.
I know too many people that have had 

1338
01:00:23,140 --> 01:00:23,990
like significant head problems from 
getting hit in the head.

1339
01:00:24,260 --> 01:00:25,370
Like people always wonder,
like,

1340
01:00:25,371 --> 01:00:30,371
why?
I'm always droning on and on about head 

1341
01:00:30,371 --> 01:00:33,101
trauma and MMA and football and the 
dangers of it because I know a lot of 

1342
01:00:33,101 --> 01:00:36,830
people that one knockout and they're 
fucked for like a year.

1343
01:00:36,860 --> 01:00:37,850
Yeah,
yeah.

1344
01:00:37,910 --> 01:00:41,480
Constant headaches,
constant ringing or year.

1345
01:00:41,960 --> 01:00:46,000
My son just got his first concussion.
I play soccer and he got a.

1346
01:00:46,430 --> 01:00:51,430
I think he had need and the head and the
collision and he was out of school for a

1347
01:00:51,680 --> 01:00:56,680
week.
He couldn't like he'd go to school and 

1348
01:00:56,680 --> 01:00:56,680
he'd have his head down on his desk and 
first beer and have to come home again.

1349
01:00:56,900 --> 01:00:58,640
It was bad and it was like,
fuck man,

1350
01:00:58,641 --> 01:01:02,060
you don't know when that happens.
A concussion can last a day.

1351
01:01:02,510 --> 01:01:03,560
You can last,
like you said,

1352
01:01:03,561 --> 01:01:08,561
it could go on and on with with 
headaches and it's really important to 

1353
01:01:08,561 --> 01:01:12,340
recognize that because there's like a 
lot of restrictions they put on athletes

1354
01:01:12,350 --> 01:01:15,230
after they'd been kod.
Like for fighters.

1355
01:01:15,260 --> 01:01:15,770
They'll,
they'll,

1356
01:01:15,870 --> 01:01:20,870
you know,
say like no contact for 30 days or 60 

1357
01:01:20,870 --> 01:01:20,870
days.
Some of them,

1358
01:01:20,870 --> 01:01:22,430
but that's not adequate because you 
really don't know.

1359
01:01:22,610 --> 01:01:26,150
Each individual case of someone getting 
knocked out is,

1360
01:01:26,260 --> 01:01:27,950
is totally different,
right?

1361
01:01:28,070 --> 01:01:33,070
One person get knocked out and they're 
fine a couple of days later and then 

1362
01:01:33,070 --> 01:01:35,570
another person would get knocked down.
They're fucked up for a long time.

1363
01:01:36,020 --> 01:01:41,020
Like I got a tk owed once in a 
kickboxing fight and I was exhausted.

1364
01:01:41,571 --> 01:01:46,571
It was the third fight of the night.
I had fought twice that night before 

1365
01:01:46,571 --> 01:01:47,600
that flight and part of it was 
exhaustion.

1366
01:01:47,601 --> 01:01:50,420
I did get clipped with a good left hook 
though my legs gave out.

1367
01:01:50,460 --> 01:01:52,190
I went down.
I never went out,

1368
01:01:52,640 --> 01:01:57,640
but sometimes a punch.
That was weird too because a punch that 

1369
01:01:57,640 --> 01:02:00,521
jaw.
What happens is it's not even 

1370
01:02:00,521 --> 01:02:02,120
necessarily your brain,
it's like the nerve behind,

1371
01:02:02,150 --> 01:02:04,460
like the nerves,
the ways it's been explained to me.

1372
01:02:04,461 --> 01:02:09,461
It's your jaw when it moves can slam 
into the nerve and when it slams into 

1373
01:02:09,951 --> 01:02:12,110
the nerve illich short circuits your 
system.

1374
01:02:12,140 --> 01:02:13,430
Yeah,
and your legs give out.

1375
01:02:13,460 --> 01:02:15,380
It's weird.
Not good for you,

1376
01:02:15,381 --> 01:02:20,381
but my point is I was fine after that.
Like I was fine that I was fine the next

1377
01:02:20,580 --> 01:02:20,580
day.

1378
01:02:20,940 --> 01:02:25,940
I mean,
I wouldn't be a good idea if I had 

1379
01:02:25,940 --> 01:02:27,801
another fight after that,
but it wasn't like a ringing in my ears 

1380
01:02:27,801 --> 01:02:31,431
and headaches and those in serious pain,
but at other times just from sparring 

1381
01:02:31,431 --> 01:02:35,871
sessions where I didn't get knocked out 
where my head was pounding for days just

1382
01:02:36,811 --> 01:02:39,840
from taking a punch or a kick and you 
don't know,

1383
01:02:39,870 --> 01:02:44,870
you don't know what day you're going to 
be fine or which day you're going to be 

1384
01:02:44,870 --> 01:02:48,411
fucked.
It all depends entirely on how you get 

1385
01:02:48,411 --> 01:02:48,480
hit,
how your body responds to it,

1386
01:02:48,780 --> 01:02:53,780
what the actual damages and no one you 
can't tell unless you get into the 

1387
01:02:53,780 --> 01:02:54,720
brain.
They really can't tell.

1388
01:02:55,040 --> 01:03:00,040
It was amazing is a James Bond will get 
knocked out like out somebody you know,

1389
01:03:00,541 --> 01:03:03,630
like a bad guy will elbow him and he'll 
fucking lose consciousness.

1390
01:03:03,960 --> 01:03:06,750
He'll get up and like drive a car,
dance.

1391
01:03:08,410 --> 01:03:09,660
Well,
it's pistol whip to.

1392
01:03:09,750 --> 01:03:14,750
He gets pissed away,
get pistol whipped in the back of the 

1393
01:03:14,750 --> 01:03:14,750
head.
They go down,

1394
01:03:14,750 --> 01:03:14,750
they wake up,
Oh,

1395
01:03:14,750 --> 01:03:18,891
you hit me up and gets going.
That's that pistol whip to the back of 

1396
01:03:19,201 --> 01:03:21,300
the head move.
It's always effective.

1397
01:03:21,690 --> 01:03:26,690
I know you've never killed a guy and and
also when you're fighting a bunch of 

1398
01:03:26,690 --> 01:03:27,990
people you can pistol whip,
you got to shoot some,

1399
01:03:28,290 --> 01:03:33,290
you can piss the whip,
the others and they'll go down and you 

1400
01:03:33,290 --> 01:03:36,081
just know they're going to stay down 
until you're clear to you're outta 

1401
01:03:36,081 --> 01:03:36,081
there.

1402
01:03:36,081 --> 01:03:37,720
When was the first time you saw someone 
actually get knocked out?

1403
01:03:40,890 --> 01:03:43,150
Who saw how many people you've seen 
getting knocked out?

1404
01:03:43,300 --> 01:03:46,700
Real life bar fights.
I've seen tons like Kaos.

1405
01:03:46,730 --> 01:03:48,340
Yeah.
I've seen cases in Boston,

1406
01:03:48,341 --> 01:03:53,341
outside of bars,
street Kales the scariest because they 

1407
01:03:53,341 --> 01:03:53,341
bounced her head off the concrete.
Yeah,

1408
01:03:53,341 --> 01:03:53,540
right.

1409
01:03:54,030 --> 01:03:59,030
Things sickening.
Just sickening about the sound of an 

1410
01:03:59,030 --> 01:04:01,010
unconscious persons head bouncing off 
the concrete.

1411
01:04:01,770 --> 01:04:04,410
Yeah.
I saw this kid when I was about 17.

1412
01:04:04,411 --> 01:04:06,870
I was at a bar and Terry town where I 
grew up in this kid,

1413
01:04:06,871 --> 01:04:08,750
uh,
he was on it.

1414
01:04:08,790 --> 01:04:13,790
He was on stairs,
this bar that had an upstairs and this 

1415
01:04:13,790 --> 01:04:16,551
one kid was coming up other than was 
coming down and they had a beef and the 

1416
01:04:16,551 --> 01:04:18,040
kid a above just fucking clock.
This guy.

1417
01:04:18,041 --> 01:04:19,440
And He fell backwards,
hit his head.

1418
01:04:19,630 --> 01:04:21,870
He was in a coma for six months.
Oh my gosh.

1419
01:04:21,940 --> 01:04:24,090
Still not 100 percent this,
you know.

1420
01:04:24,360 --> 01:04:25,530
I mean,
10 years later,

1421
01:04:25,531 --> 01:04:27,960
I haven't seen him since,
but 10 years later the guy was off.

1422
01:04:28,020 --> 01:04:33,020
Oh my God.
What happened to the guy who did it to 

1423
01:04:33,020 --> 01:04:33,020
them?
Went to jail for how long?

1424
01:04:33,020 --> 01:04:34,320
It's like three months off.
Nope.

1425
01:04:34,800 --> 01:04:36,600
FARC now.
Bar Fights.

1426
01:04:36,601 --> 01:04:37,440
No joke,
man.

1427
01:04:37,520 --> 01:04:42,520
Kevin James used to work as a bouncer in
a bar and long island guy who was 

1428
01:04:42,520 --> 01:04:42,680
working with punched a guy.
The guy fell back,

1429
01:04:42,681 --> 01:04:44,150
hit his head off the curb and die.

1430
01:04:44,250 --> 01:04:45,450
Who?

1431
01:04:46,120 --> 01:04:49,600
Yeah,
just fucking bar fight bouncer drunk guy

1432
01:04:49,630 --> 01:04:52,150
punches the guy jail,
go to jail.

1433
01:04:52,720 --> 01:04:53,860
Jail.
Manslaughter.

1434
01:04:53,900 --> 01:04:55,030
Hold.
Wow.

1435
01:04:55,180 --> 01:04:55,450
Yeah,

1436
01:04:55,590 --> 01:04:56,620
just,
it's no joke.

1437
01:04:56,621 --> 01:04:57,940
People think it's a joke.
You know,

1438
01:04:57,941 --> 01:05:02,941
it's like you got all these tough guys 
that go out to the bars and then you 

1439
01:05:02,941 --> 01:05:02,941
know,
hey,

1440
01:05:02,941 --> 01:05:03,420
we have a fistfight and you know,
it's,

1441
01:05:03,460 --> 01:05:06,460
it can end very fucking tragically.
Very fast.

1442
01:05:06,570 --> 01:05:06,750
Some

1443
01:05:06,750 --> 01:05:10,290
comic at the comedy store got knocked 
out like about,

1444
01:05:10,380 --> 01:05:12,990
I want to say about a year ago.
Maybe even less.

1445
01:05:13,050 --> 01:05:13,880
Yeah,
um,

1446
01:05:14,310 --> 01:05:19,310
he was on a motorcycle and he pulled up 
to the comedy store and he parked his 

1447
01:05:19,310 --> 01:05:24,031
motorcycle and um,
I guess he kept it running and some guy 

1448
01:05:24,031 --> 01:05:28,261
yelled at him,
he met shut that fucking thing off like 

1449
01:05:28,261 --> 01:05:30,070
they were having a conversation like 
over by the patio and he laughed at.

1450
01:05:30,071 --> 01:05:35,071
I'm like,
because the guy was like saying that 

1451
01:05:35,071 --> 01:05:35,071
like really aggressive and he took his 
helmet off,

1452
01:05:35,071 --> 01:05:39,691
the guy walked over to them and just 
fucking cold cocked him and knocked him 

1453
01:05:39,691 --> 01:05:40,720
out just for having a motorcycle running
shit.

1454
01:05:41,050 --> 01:05:44,650
I guess it was one of those who's loud,
like Harley things that people love.

1455
01:05:44,680 --> 01:05:46,270
They love those loud.
Right.

1456
01:05:46,600 --> 01:05:50,170
But those are loud.
That's good because it saves you from

1457
01:05:50,640 --> 01:05:53,320
colliding India if I was a cop,
you know they have like,

1458
01:05:53,490 --> 01:05:56,400
they have like a noise meter.
That is my biggest pet peeve.

1459
01:05:56,401 --> 01:06:01,401
You're having a conversation on the 
street and you have to stop for 20 

1460
01:06:01,401 --> 01:06:05,571
seconds cause some fucking asshole has 
got a muffler that he jacked up to make 

1461
01:06:05,571 --> 01:06:07,050
that much noise.
Like he's Oh,

1462
01:06:07,051 --> 01:06:11,690
who do you powerful?
Oh Shit.

1463
01:06:12,900 --> 01:06:15,150
And you feel it in your chest when they 
go by,

1464
01:06:15,270 --> 01:06:17,350
they're really loud.
Some of those bugs really,

1465
01:06:17,370 --> 01:06:22,370
really second only to the truck that has
like that massive horn that makes your 

1466
01:06:22,411 --> 01:06:24,570
body go paralyzed for like a second.

1467
01:06:26,100 --> 01:06:27,720
Like a,
like a dog whistle.

1468
01:06:28,350 --> 01:06:31,770
Yeah.
Your body just goes,

1469
01:06:31,840 --> 01:06:32,730
what?
Yeah.

1470
01:06:33,690 --> 01:06:35,490
Yeah.
Those loud motorcycles though,

1471
01:06:35,700 --> 01:06:38,100
like I guess too loud is,
you know,

1472
01:06:38,160 --> 01:06:39,720
a problem.
But like a Harley,

1473
01:06:39,721 --> 01:06:42,440
like when you buy one from a store 
without fucking with it,

1474
01:06:42,480 --> 01:06:44,100
that's fine.
But that,

1475
01:06:44,310 --> 01:06:49,310
that level of loudness apparently 
prevents a lot of accidents because 

1476
01:06:49,310 --> 01:06:53,481
people hear it and then they avoid you.
Because like part of the problem with 

1477
01:06:53,481 --> 01:06:56,781
motorcycle accidents,
like say if you have like one of those 

1478
01:06:56,781 --> 01:06:56,781
Japanese speed bikes,
they don't make that much noise.

1479
01:06:56,880 --> 01:07:00,570
So you got to come when you're next to 
people so they know you're there because

1480
01:07:00,571 --> 01:07:05,571
people are fucking texting and drifting.
How often do you look over and you see 

1481
01:07:05,571 --> 01:07:05,571
people texting?

1482
01:07:05,571 --> 01:07:10,150
Hell yeah.
And I drive a Prius because I'm dead 

1483
01:07:10,150 --> 01:07:10,150
inside.
But people,

1484
01:07:10,150 --> 01:07:12,120
people really can't hear you.
I pulled up today to,

1485
01:07:12,130 --> 01:07:17,130
to Valley Park and uh,
the guy's fucking sitting there doing a 

1486
01:07:17,130 --> 01:07:17,720
crossword puzzle and I'm looking at him 
and uh,

1487
01:07:17,721 --> 01:07:18,890
and I finally went,
excuse me.

1488
01:07:18,891 --> 01:07:19,250
He was like,
oh,

1489
01:07:19,251 --> 01:07:20,210
sorry,
I didn't hear Ya.

1490
01:07:20,211 --> 01:07:25,211
And it's like,
you feel insignificant already in a 

1491
01:07:25,211 --> 01:07:25,760
Prius.
He felt castrated and zero.

1492
01:07:26,630 --> 01:07:28,730
They don't make any noise.
Like here's me flooring it.

1493
01:07:31,970 --> 01:07:34,540
Then your car.
No,

1494
01:07:34,610 --> 01:07:36,380
you want to get a nice car.
I can get.

1495
01:07:36,440 --> 01:07:37,790
You've been thinking about this for 
years.

1496
01:07:37,791 --> 01:07:41,360
What holds you back?
I need a little bump of money to justify

1497
01:07:41,361 --> 01:07:43,160
it because the college fund isn't there 
yet.

1498
01:07:43,161 --> 01:07:45,800
I got to get a little,
get a nice little hit,

1499
01:07:46,640 --> 01:07:47,900
go out and buy that Mustang.

1500
01:07:48,250 --> 01:07:50,220
She's the new ones.
Seen the new ones?

1501
01:07:50,221 --> 01:07:51,570
Yeah.
My friend Matt Farah,

1502
01:07:51,690 --> 01:07:55,020
like the bank sent me a text.
Apparently the new shelby,

1503
01:07:55,021 --> 01:07:57,390
they have a new shelby gt,
3:50

1504
01:07:57,690 --> 01:08:01,830
and he just sent me a text about it and 
he said he's,

1505
01:08:01,860 --> 01:08:06,860
he's emailing everyone who knows it for 
just begging them to sell them one 

1506
01:08:06,860 --> 01:08:08,790
because they're hard to get hard to get 
because shelby gt 3:50.

1507
01:08:09,300 --> 01:08:11,070
So they have a pr guy that's going to 
hook them up,

1508
01:08:11,071 --> 01:08:14,610
but he said like literally it is the 
best car he's ever driven.

1509
01:08:14,850 --> 01:08:16,100
How is it?
I don't know.

1510
01:08:16,130 --> 01:08:19,760
Not that expensive though.
It was like less than a lot of cars,

1511
01:08:19,850 --> 01:08:22,280
but apparently they're really hard to 
get the shelby but you don't need to.

1512
01:08:22,300 --> 01:08:27,300
Shelby like a GT Mustang gt.
But one of the cool things about the 

1513
01:08:27,300 --> 01:08:30,761
horsepower wars,
like here's what's all that white stuff 

1514
01:08:30,761 --> 01:08:31,370
on it.
Is that just like shininess?

1515
01:08:31,371 --> 01:08:35,070
What does that sort of fucked up part of
what the artifact?

1516
01:08:38,010 --> 01:08:43,010
Um,
see if you find another one is not on 

1517
01:08:43,010 --> 01:08:43,010
your screen.
Oh,

1518
01:08:43,010 --> 01:08:44,690
it's only when they transferred over to 
the television.

1519
01:08:45,080 --> 01:08:47,520
How weird,
how fucking strangers that.

1520
01:08:49,190 --> 01:08:50,680
There's other images I'm sure you could 
find.

1521
01:08:50,700 --> 01:08:52,860
But anyway,
the car is a monster,

1522
01:08:52,880 --> 01:08:56,600
but a regular Mustang gt.
The thing is a regular one,

1523
01:08:56,601 --> 01:08:58,820
like find out how much a regular Mustang
gt is.

1524
01:08:58,821 --> 01:09:03,620
I think it's only about,
I want to say it's about 35 grand.

1525
01:09:04,980 --> 01:09:09,980
It gets more than that.
I think a regular Mustang just like a 

1526
01:09:09,980 --> 01:09:11,160
baseline Mustang or you can get for 
about 32,

1527
01:09:11,430 --> 01:09:14,230
really just don't,
not gt 3:50.

1528
01:09:14,240 --> 01:09:17,240
Jamie g just dt.
Ford Mustang Gt.

1529
01:09:18,020 --> 01:09:19,850
Yeah.
How much of those pitches cost?

1530
01:09:20,960 --> 01:09:24,110
I think like.
Well the thing what I was saying is like

1531
01:09:24,200 --> 01:09:28,340
for the amount of look at that 32 grand 
for a Mustang gt,

1532
01:09:28,360 --> 01:09:33,360
that's fucking crazy.
The amount of power that those things 

1533
01:09:33,360 --> 01:09:34,400
have and how good they run and how good 
they drive.

1534
01:09:34,670 --> 01:09:39,670
It's a bargain.
It's an amazing bargain because they 

1535
01:09:39,670 --> 01:09:41,840
have more than 400 horsepower.
Those things are fast as fuck.

1536
01:09:42,050 --> 01:09:43,670
Like what is it?
Four hundred and 30.

1537
01:09:43,671 --> 01:09:44,470
What does it say there,
Jamie?

1538
01:09:44,480 --> 01:09:46,340
Don't scroll real quick.
What does it say?

1539
01:09:46,341 --> 01:09:49,160
Four 35.
Four hundred 35 fucking horsepower.

1540
01:09:49,370 --> 01:09:52,070
Four hundred foot pound of Torque for 32
grand.

1541
01:09:52,490 --> 01:09:55,970
I mean that's incredible.
And the interior looks good.

1542
01:09:56,330 --> 01:09:58,490
They have Ricardo cloth front seats.

1543
01:09:58,660 --> 01:10:01,570
I think about what it would've cost to 
make a car with those dimensions.

1544
01:10:01,571 --> 01:10:02,920
Ten years ago they couldn't do it.

1545
01:10:03,120 --> 01:10:04,110
Well,
how about this?

1546
01:10:04,350 --> 01:10:09,350
You would.
You would blow the doors off of Ferrari 

1547
01:10:09,350 --> 01:10:11,670
of 20 years ago with this car was 
$32,000

1548
01:10:11,671 --> 01:10:16,671
car and it sounds great.
It's a wonderful American v eight and 

1549
01:10:16,671 --> 01:10:21,490
look great.
I mean I would drive that 100 percent 

1550
01:10:21,490 --> 01:10:22,470
and it'd be fun.
Those were fun to fucking drive,

1551
01:10:22,471 --> 01:10:22,920
man.
Yeah,

1552
01:10:22,950 --> 01:10:25,080
it's a great car.
And for 32 grand,

1553
01:10:25,860 --> 01:10:30,860
whenever we talk about these things,
people will get mad and they go through 

1554
01:10:30,860 --> 01:10:30,860
two grooms,
lunar moon and relax.

1555
01:10:30,870 --> 01:10:32,300
I gotta get some ads.
Am I uh,

1556
01:10:32,340 --> 01:10:37,340
my ads have slowed down on my podcast.
I gotta I gotTa Hook some up if they 

1557
01:10:37,340 --> 01:10:39,510
slowed down because you haven't pursued 
them are now I think my,

1558
01:10:39,511 --> 01:10:39,800
uh,

1559
01:10:41,180 --> 01:10:43,810
people.
Your ad people are not good that they're

1560
01:10:43,830 --> 01:10:48,830
slacking slack and it's hard.
It's hard to do all that shit yourself.

1561
01:10:49,000 --> 01:10:54,000
Yeah.
You rely on other people to get it for 

1562
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:54,000
you.
They better do their job.

1563
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:57,120
Right.
I'll connect you to my guys after we're 

1564
01:10:57,120 --> 01:10:57,120
done here.
Yeah,

1565
01:10:57,120 --> 01:10:57,140
they're good time.
Yeah.

1566
01:10:57,141 --> 01:11:02,141
You got.
The thing is you got to find something 

1567
01:11:02,141 --> 01:11:02,141
you actually like,
like,

1568
01:11:02,141 --> 01:11:05,801
uh,
my favorite ads are like dollar shave 

1569
01:11:05,801 --> 01:11:05,801
club.

1570
01:11:05,801 --> 01:11:05,801
Yeah,
fuck yeah,

1571
01:11:05,801 --> 01:11:07,440
dollar shave legit.
It's great.

1572
01:11:07,580 --> 01:11:10,910
One hundred percent legit.
I like advertising that I like.

1573
01:11:10,920 --> 01:11:14,760
A squarespace is good.
Blue Apron,

1574
01:11:14,820 --> 01:11:17,820
blue apron is great.
Fucking less than 10 bucks a meal.

1575
01:11:18,450 --> 01:11:20,400
Finding stuff that you.
That's the whole key to it.

1576
01:11:20,401 --> 01:11:25,401
Look,
I haven't had a lot of people try to 

1577
01:11:25,401 --> 01:11:25,401
advertise and I'm like,
Ooh,

1578
01:11:25,401 --> 01:11:29,870
I can't get behind that.
One of them was like an uber for 

1579
01:11:29,870 --> 01:11:29,870
babysitters.
I was like,

1580
01:11:29,870 --> 01:11:31,570
get the fuck out of here.
Really crazy gonna.

1581
01:11:31,590 --> 01:11:34,050
Have some person come over and watch 
the,

1582
01:11:34,140 --> 01:11:37,440
the most important person in your life 
other than your spouse.

1583
01:11:37,650 --> 01:11:39,990
Just randomly.
Randomly because it's cheaper.

1584
01:11:40,110 --> 01:11:40,640
Yeah,
they're old.

1585
01:11:40,641 --> 01:11:42,860
They're screened like,
yeah,

1586
01:11:43,020 --> 01:11:45,330
there's certain things you can't go by 
price.

1587
01:11:47,390 --> 01:11:48,540
Yeah,
there is a,

1588
01:11:49,210 --> 01:11:49,560
yeah,
they,

1589
01:11:49,561 --> 01:11:52,470
some that uh,
do you do the betting sites?

1590
01:11:52,471 --> 01:11:54,570
Like a draft kings and all that?
Yeah,

1591
01:11:54,571 --> 01:11:56,250
I did.
I had him for a long time.

1592
01:11:56,251 --> 01:11:57,910
I haven't done one in awhile.
I,

1593
01:11:57,960 --> 01:11:59,880
I liked,
I liked the idea behind it,

1594
01:11:59,881 --> 01:12:04,881
but some people say that there's issues 
with how you get paid.

1595
01:12:05,430 --> 01:12:07,650
Oh yeah.
Or not how you get paid rather.

1596
01:12:07,651 --> 01:12:09,510
But um,
how many people get paid?

1597
01:12:09,610 --> 01:12:11,070
Like when you saying something like 
that,

1598
01:12:11,071 --> 01:12:12,000
Jamie,
what were you saying?

1599
01:12:13,050 --> 01:12:18,050
When I found out about most of it was 
like one percent of the players are 

1600
01:12:18,050 --> 01:12:19,440
making something like 90 to 95 percent 
of the money.

1601
01:12:20,880 --> 01:12:25,880
Again,
these fucking Goddamn one percent of 

1602
01:12:25,880 --> 01:12:26,550
white guys,
white guys and knew a lot about sports.

1603
01:12:26,551 --> 01:12:31,551
But I feel like if you know and even 
understand a lot about like mma and 

1604
01:12:31,551 --> 01:12:31,740
that's one of the things where,
um,

1605
01:12:31,860 --> 01:12:32,430
I like it.

1606
01:12:33,030 --> 01:12:33,900
I'm like,
man,

1607
01:12:34,140 --> 01:12:37,980
I feel like you could make money.
Like if you're one of those crazy people

1608
01:12:37,981 --> 01:12:42,981
that goes on mixed martial arts.com
and you're there every day and know all 

1609
01:12:42,981 --> 01:12:42,981
the fucking stats,
you know,

1610
01:12:42,981 --> 01:12:43,590
what,
excuse me,

1611
01:12:44,550 --> 01:12:46,490
watch all the training videos.
You know,

1612
01:12:46,500 --> 01:12:48,310
who's trading with WHO and what.
Wow,

1613
01:12:48,390 --> 01:12:50,540
this guy has got this new trainer and 
it's going to help them with.

1614
01:12:50,880 --> 01:12:54,210
I just feel like those guys.
Did you have any inkling about that last

1615
01:12:54,211 --> 01:12:56,340
fight?
The two big upsets last week.

1616
01:12:56,410 --> 01:12:57,210
Yet,
both of them.

1617
01:12:57,280 --> 01:12:59,460
We had a failing on both of them.
They'd be upsets.

1618
01:12:59,700 --> 01:13:04,700
No,
I had a feeling that holly could get 

1619
01:13:04,700 --> 01:13:07,101
beat by Meesha,
but I thought connor was gonna get beat 

1620
01:13:07,101 --> 01:13:07,101
by nate.
I had a feeling.

1621
01:13:07,101 --> 01:13:09,930
I said it to my friends too that were 
sitting right behind me.

1622
01:13:10,240 --> 01:13:13,410
I took my headset off as they were doing
the introductions.

1623
01:13:13,410 --> 01:13:14,960
I said this.
No Shit.

1624
01:13:14,970 --> 01:13:15,890
Really?
Yeah,

1625
01:13:15,940 --> 01:13:16,940
I could.
Well,

1626
01:13:16,980 --> 01:13:21,980
we just saw an upset with me.
She choked holly out and I knew that 

1627
01:13:21,980 --> 01:13:24,930
Misha was gonna fight.
Real smart in the way she fought,

1628
01:13:24,931 --> 01:13:29,340
was super cautious on the outside and 
she made holly come to her,

1629
01:13:29,520 --> 01:13:32,340
which is not a holly likes to fight.
When Ronda fought,

1630
01:13:32,341 --> 01:13:37,341
holly was the perfect fight for holly 
because Rhonda charged after like a 

1631
01:13:37,341 --> 01:13:39,690
maniac and holly just sidestepped 
blasted her,

1632
01:13:39,900 --> 01:13:41,280
move back,
blasted her.

1633
01:13:41,281 --> 01:13:46,281
She just countered her.
And for a person who's a counter 

1634
01:13:46,281 --> 01:13:49,101
striker,
that style that Rhonda employed is the 

1635
01:13:49,101 --> 01:13:49,710
perfect style.
Even more perfect for someone like holly

1636
01:13:49,711 --> 01:13:53,520
because Rhonda doesn't kick.
So Rhonda has a short range attack,

1637
01:13:53,760 --> 01:13:58,760
short range attack,
and on top of that her grappling is 

1638
01:13:58,760 --> 01:14:01,080
illimited attack because she only likes 
to tie up with upper body.

1639
01:14:01,320 --> 01:14:03,630
Like Rhonda doesn't take anybody down by
shooting on their legs,

1640
01:14:04,080 --> 01:14:06,580
so I knew that holly fighting Misha 
would.

1641
01:14:07,130 --> 01:14:09,030
She would have a totally different type 
of opponent.

1642
01:14:09,031 --> 01:14:09,460
First of all,
me,

1643
01:14:09,480 --> 01:14:11,010
she's not going to charge out or she's 
not.

1644
01:14:11,830 --> 01:14:12,070
She's

1645
01:14:12,070 --> 01:14:15,520
not reckless.
She's not a fucking crazed maniac.

1646
01:14:15,521 --> 01:14:16,900
Like Rhonda wasn't that fight.
Rhonda,

1647
01:14:16,901 --> 01:14:19,160
which just started maniacs.
Just want to smash her face in.

1648
01:14:19,210 --> 01:14:20,770
Yeah,
you can't find like that.

1649
01:14:21,250 --> 01:14:23,350
And meesha fought like super 
intelligent,

1650
01:14:23,351 --> 01:14:26,980
very cautious state in the outside.
And then once in the second round me got

1651
01:14:26,981 --> 01:14:28,810
her down and just dominated on the 
ground.

1652
01:14:28,811 --> 01:14:29,410
I was like,
oh,

1653
01:14:29,411 --> 01:14:32,140
okay.
That my suspicions were correct me,

1654
01:14:32,141 --> 01:14:37,141
she can do this.
But then holly pulled it off for the 

1655
01:14:37,141 --> 01:14:40,740
next couple of rounds and it looked like
holly was going to probably win a 

1656
01:14:40,740 --> 01:14:43,411
decision if she won the last round.
And then Misha took her down and choked 

1657
01:14:43,411 --> 01:14:43,420
her unconscious and that was just 
madness.

1658
01:14:43,480 --> 01:14:46,210
That must've been a payout on picking 
the underdogs.

1659
01:14:46,211 --> 01:14:47,950
And those two must have been here.
Giant.

1660
01:14:48,130 --> 01:14:53,130
I think it was six to one with conor and
nate and I think Misha and holly was 

1661
01:14:53,130 --> 01:14:53,620
something like three to one.

1662
01:14:53,630 --> 01:14:55,600
Yeah,
know my own might've made that up.

1663
01:14:55,720 --> 01:14:57,510
I think if you pick them both and bet 
100 bucks.

1664
01:14:57,520 --> 01:14:59,590
You want something like 1500 bucks 
together.

1665
01:14:59,720 --> 01:15:01,120
Jamie.
Jamie,

1666
01:15:01,121 --> 01:15:04,210
bet on nate and one 500 bucks.
There you go.

1667
01:15:04,270 --> 01:15:06,160
Yeah.
Jamie was there where I got a picture of

1668
01:15:06,161 --> 01:15:11,161
Jamie,
Tony and my friend frosty the three of 

1669
01:15:11,161 --> 01:15:11,161
them holding up their betting slips 
right after the fight.

1670
01:15:11,180 --> 01:15:12,050
Oh yeah,
yeah.

1671
01:15:13,610 --> 01:15:17,290
No frosties a sound guy for the UFC.
He's a sound engineer,

1672
01:15:18,100 --> 01:15:23,100
but I'm,
I see Jamie taken that Joe Rogan 

1673
01:15:23,100 --> 01:15:23,500
experience money and fucking Dublin it 
down.

1674
01:15:24,850 --> 01:15:25,570
Yeah.
There's um,

1675
01:15:25,820 --> 01:15:30,820
there's Tony edgecliff to Al.
I saw a great picture of um,

1676
01:15:31,900 --> 01:15:34,060
uh,
who was it in the background?

1677
01:15:34,240 --> 01:15:35,770
Kissing on the kiss cam.

1678
01:15:35,930 --> 01:15:36,920
Oh,
ren duck.

1679
01:15:38,760 --> 01:15:41,540
It was fucking great.
Now that before they were kissing,

1680
01:15:41,541 --> 01:15:46,541
you were throwing up illuminati signs 
and they waited until the fucking camera

1681
01:15:50,771 --> 01:15:55,180
was right on them and they turned and 
kissed tongue and everything.

1682
01:15:55,181 --> 01:15:56,740
By the way,
watch this.

1683
01:15:56,741 --> 01:15:57,640
Watch this.
Here it is.

1684
01:15:59,110 --> 01:16:04,110
If the camera's on him,
see the boundaries grabbed her face,

1685
01:16:05,891 --> 01:16:07,480
like,
what the fuck did we do?

1686
01:16:12,080 --> 01:16:13,310
Oh,
that's so bad.

1687
01:16:13,360 --> 01:16:17,900
It's like bora doing that cage match 
down south that bruno.

1688
01:16:17,910 --> 01:16:22,540
Now those guys are animals living there.
This throwing up the illuminati science.

1689
01:16:27,660 --> 01:16:32,660
they're probably on mushrooms too.
They get on mushrooms all the time when 

1690
01:16:32,660 --> 01:16:35,840
they do the ufc because you could sit 
there for a long time.

1691
01:16:35,841 --> 01:16:40,841
Look at that as a thing about that is 
you do it in the moment

1692
01:16:43,580 --> 01:16:46,630
what it is funny and then all you're 
thinking about is the two dudes that are

1693
01:16:46,631 --> 01:16:48,630
sitting behind you the whole time for 
the rest of them,

1694
01:16:49,320 --> 01:16:52,840
are they going to do that again with the
fact they were sitting in the seats that

1695
01:16:52,841 --> 01:16:54,640
are right behind me so they weren't 
even.

1696
01:16:54,641 --> 01:16:56,620
Audience sees that as a production 
seats.

1697
01:16:56,980 --> 01:16:58,870
They're sitting in like the best seats 
there.

1698
01:16:59,070 --> 01:17:01,400
They're three feet from the cage.
They're bright.

1699
01:17:01,420 --> 01:17:02,720
They're.
They're like literally,

1700
01:17:02,721 --> 01:17:04,690
they could touch me.
They could touch my back.

1701
01:17:04,720 --> 01:17:09,720
I was supposed to be at that lab.
We did a gig together in vegas not too 

1702
01:17:09,720 --> 01:17:09,720
long ago with a fight.
The next day,

1703
01:17:09,720 --> 01:17:10,780
and I had to fucking bail.
Dammit.

1704
01:17:10,820 --> 01:17:13,370
Cleanouts.
No mustang.

1705
01:17:13,371 --> 01:17:16,250
No.
No ring side seats are missing it all.

1706
01:17:17,120 --> 01:17:18,260
Oh,
can we plug by the way,

1707
01:17:18,261 --> 01:17:19,520
the tomorrow night.
Tomorrow night?

1708
01:17:19,580 --> 01:17:20,120
Yeah.
We're,

1709
01:17:20,121 --> 01:17:22,790
we're at the improv March 17th st 
patrick's day.

1710
01:17:22,790 --> 01:17:26,850
Joe rogan joining once again.
I believe you did it last year too.

1711
01:17:26,870 --> 01:17:27,980
A couple times,
but yeah,

1712
01:17:27,990 --> 01:17:30,710
done a few times.
The st patrick's day show.

1713
01:17:30,740 --> 01:17:33,270
We got all irish comics coming down.
Uh,

1714
01:17:33,380 --> 01:17:34,430
joel,
mick rogan.

1715
01:17:34,850 --> 01:17:38,320
Uh,
karen kill sheriff my gibbons.

1716
01:17:38,720 --> 01:17:40,640
We've got a special guest.
I can't even announce.

1717
01:17:40,641 --> 01:17:41,960
Huge name guests.
Yeah.

1718
01:17:42,230 --> 01:17:45,350
Because you're irish.
A greek.

1719
01:17:46,880 --> 01:17:47,810
Okay.
We'll talk later.

1720
01:17:47,900 --> 01:17:48,610
All right.
Okay.

1721
01:17:48,770 --> 01:17:49,850
That'd be good.
Tickets.

1722
01:17:50,030 --> 01:17:51,830
Some tickets left.
Go to the improv.

1723
01:17:51,970 --> 01:17:54,560
Always a good time.
Always dab a little irish.

1724
01:17:54,590 --> 01:17:56,150
I'm one quarter irish.
That's it.

1725
01:17:56,180 --> 01:17:58,070
So it's real.
You're still switched.

1726
01:17:58,290 --> 01:18:00,620
Your stolen the show.
Yeah.

1727
01:18:00,920 --> 01:18:05,920
They have a party afterwards.
Little corn beef next door and some 

1728
01:18:05,920 --> 01:18:09,100
irish music and decorations and I'm so 
glad they turned the improv around and 

1729
01:18:09,100 --> 01:18:13,781
have that bar in the front of them.
They had it all wrong for about a year 

1730
01:18:13,781 --> 01:18:13,781
there.
Will.

1731
01:18:13,781 --> 01:18:15,860
They turned it into like some lounge and
encino.

1732
01:18:15,950 --> 01:18:18,440
Yeah.
It was like it was white in there and it

1733
01:18:18,441 --> 01:18:20,360
was weird.
Dick decorations.

1734
01:18:20,361 --> 01:18:21,710
Like,
who designed this?

1735
01:18:21,810 --> 01:18:24,920
Yeah.
Now it's darK again and it looks cool.

1736
01:18:24,950 --> 01:18:26,810
There was nothing wrong with it in the 
first place.

1737
01:18:26,811 --> 01:18:29,000
It was perfect before.
Well,

1738
01:18:29,090 --> 01:18:32,960
I don't know why they did it just to 
leave a good thing alone.

1739
01:18:33,020 --> 01:18:38,020
I think they thought they were going to 
have a suCcessful restaurant in the 

1740
01:18:38,020 --> 01:18:38,020
front.
Yeah,

1741
01:18:38,020 --> 01:18:41,290
for some reason.
And it didn't pan Out in the restaurant 

1742
01:18:41,290 --> 01:18:41,290
didn't work out.
They didn't.

1743
01:18:41,290 --> 01:18:44,890
Which most restaurants don't.
They say like 90 percent of all 

1744
01:18:44,890 --> 01:18:46,580
restaurants fail in the first year,
but they got a bag.

1745
01:18:46,581 --> 01:18:47,300
It's gReat.
Again,

1746
01:18:48,440 --> 01:18:50,420
back to its roots.
That's great.

1747
01:18:50,421 --> 01:18:51,170
Club.
Yeah.

1748
01:18:51,380 --> 01:18:53,090
AnD I looked at.
They have a second room now.

1749
01:18:53,091 --> 01:18:54,920
They have that lab.
You the labs.

1750
01:18:54,921 --> 01:18:55,580
Good.
Have you done it?

1751
01:18:55,581 --> 01:18:56,490
Fucking great.
Yeah.

1752
01:18:56,491 --> 01:19:00,470
It's really just sort of did ari when 
that's when he first started his.

1753
01:19:00,740 --> 01:19:05,740
This is not happening.
The show that was on last night on 

1754
01:19:05,740 --> 01:19:05,740
comedy central,
which is on every week now,

1755
01:19:05,740 --> 01:19:07,820
um,
before already had that television show.

1756
01:19:07,821 --> 01:19:12,821
He started that off in the improv lab,
I think I want to say like six years 

1757
01:19:12,821 --> 01:19:12,821
ago.
Yeah.

1758
01:19:13,040 --> 01:19:17,210
And he's,
his idea was as very smart idea that you

1759
01:19:17,870 --> 01:19:22,870
would develop stories better and really 
tightened them up if there wasn't 

1760
01:19:22,870 --> 01:19:26,981
pressure to do like traditional standup.
So like he would do storytelling shows 

1761
01:19:26,981 --> 01:19:31,571
and they would do them on a theme like 
guys who have been arrested or people 

1762
01:19:31,571 --> 01:19:32,330
that have done too many drugs,
whatever.

1763
01:19:32,510 --> 01:19:37,510
And you would do,
he would do a theme on these things and 

1764
01:19:37,510 --> 01:19:39,440
you go up there and just explore the 
story and if you could do that you would

1765
01:19:39,441 --> 01:19:42,070
find the funny stuff in there because 
you,

1766
01:19:42,370 --> 01:19:43,870
it's a different format.
You know,

1767
01:19:43,940 --> 01:19:45,500
it's,
you're kind of doing standup.

1768
01:19:46,250 --> 01:19:51,250
But then some guys will fuck it up.
Like they'd go up there and they would 

1769
01:19:51,250 --> 01:19:51,250
just set up punch lines,
just jokes.

1770
01:19:51,250 --> 01:19:55,930
But theN like diaz does it right.
Like diaz would tell you these crazy 

1771
01:19:55,930 --> 01:19:57,050
stories and they would be funny and find
the funny in them.

1772
01:19:57,320 --> 01:20:02,320
And a lot of those became bits because 
he got comfortable and he did too as 

1773
01:20:02,320 --> 01:20:03,890
well.
Get comfortable saying them.

1774
01:20:03,891 --> 01:20:07,190
And the storytelling format and then 
sort of edited down and honed,

1775
01:20:07,350 --> 01:20:08,130
sharpened,
didn't

1776
01:20:08,130 --> 01:20:10,020
folded the steel,
then it may become a,

1777
01:20:10,380 --> 01:20:11,910
a really solid bit,
right.

1778
01:20:11,970 --> 01:20:13,830
That's where it starts.
You know,

1779
01:20:13,831 --> 01:20:18,831
I got a new bit about uh,
seeing a couple of fucking in the hotel 

1780
01:20:18,831 --> 01:20:19,560
room across from me.
Yeah.

1781
01:20:19,650 --> 01:20:21,120
Yeah.
it was fucking amazing.

1782
01:20:21,121 --> 01:20:22,260
I mean,
I won't do the bid.

1783
01:20:22,261 --> 01:20:27,261
I'll tell you,
the story has now turned into a bit 

1784
01:20:27,261 --> 01:20:28,740
debt.
Fucking crushes.

1785
01:20:29,340 --> 01:20:34,340
I mean it went from you to have.
Sometimes you get a new bit and it can 

1786
01:20:34,340 --> 01:20:37,491
take three months to become your closing
bit because you're still working out 

1787
01:20:37,491 --> 01:20:40,760
this thing raced to closing bit in like 
five tellings of it really.

1788
01:20:41,160 --> 01:20:46,160
So I won't do the bit,
but I'll tell you the story which is 

1789
01:20:46,160 --> 01:20:46,160
basically near year's.
Even portland,

1790
01:20:46,320 --> 01:20:51,320
the hotel Is like a horseshoe shape.
So I'm on the 10th floor and I look 

1791
01:20:51,320 --> 01:20:52,410
across into a room and the curtains are 
open,

1792
01:20:52,411 --> 01:20:54,450
lights are on,
chick is on her back,

1793
01:20:54,510 --> 01:20:59,510
legs up.
And this dude who's ripped his fucking 

1794
01:20:59,510 --> 01:21:02,370
pounding her and I'm just standing there
looking at him like,

1795
01:21:02,600 --> 01:21:04,200
like this is the greatest thing I've 
ever,

1796
01:21:04,620 --> 01:21:06,020
greatest things that ever happened.
I got,

1797
01:21:06,210 --> 01:21:10,410
I slept my bag in my hand and I'm just 
transfixed and they're,

1798
01:21:10,411 --> 01:21:11,760
you know,
they're really fucking.

1799
01:21:11,761 --> 01:21:13,230
And at one point he,
uh,

1800
01:21:13,760 --> 01:21:14,600
he,
he's,

1801
01:21:14,610 --> 01:21:18,570
he goes down on one knee,
eats or out stands up,

1802
01:21:18,571 --> 01:21:20,800
keeps fucking.
I'm like high five in the glass,

1803
01:21:20,801 --> 01:21:23,460
like go.
And then.

1804
01:21:23,580 --> 01:21:27,120
And so I had the curtain closed because 
I didn't want them to see me,

1805
01:21:28,460 --> 01:21:33,230
but I popped my head through the curt,
I looked like a photographer from the 19

1806
01:21:33,310 --> 01:21:33,650
thirties.

1807
01:21:38,810 --> 01:21:42,570
And then I start thinking about what it 
must sound like.

1808
01:21:42,571 --> 01:21:44,480
And this a sound.
This where it gets creepy,

1809
01:21:44,870 --> 01:21:49,870
creepy air is I leave my room.
I walked down the hall and I stand 

1810
01:21:49,870 --> 01:21:54,441
outside the room and I listen and I hear
him grunting and I hear her go to my 

1811
01:21:57,641 --> 01:22:00,040
room and I call.
I call the room.

1812
01:22:00,810 --> 01:22:02,840
Just watching him waiting,
waiting.

1813
01:22:02,841 --> 01:22:04,840
And he didn't pick up that.
If he did,

1814
01:22:04,841 --> 01:22:05,430
I would have been like,

1815
01:22:07,390 --> 01:22:07,620
yeah,

1816
01:22:17,220 --> 01:22:20,570
but what's better than some free nudity?
Like you didn't earn it.

1817
01:22:20,600 --> 01:22:23,480
You didn't have to void.
Take anyone out to dinner.

1818
01:22:23,481 --> 01:22:25,610
You didn't have to go to a strip club.
You just,

1819
01:22:25,910 --> 01:22:28,340
you just see some nudity in a window.
Well,

1820
01:22:28,341 --> 01:22:32,390
it's way more exciting for sure.
Accidental nudity is way more exciting.

1821
01:22:32,930 --> 01:22:37,930
The voice,
this avoider instinct that all of us 

1822
01:22:37,930 --> 01:22:37,930
have for whatever reason.
I don't know why,

1823
01:22:38,030 --> 01:22:39,110
you know?
That's why like,

1824
01:22:39,111 --> 01:22:41,750
like those Jennifer Lawrence leaks,
sex pigs,

1825
01:22:42,950 --> 01:22:44,840
she knows.
She sent that to her boyfriend.

1826
01:22:44,841 --> 01:22:49,841
Like oh my god.
It's her like spreading her cheeks and 

1827
01:22:49,841 --> 01:22:52,670
like Jennifer Lawrence showing her pussy
and asshole and taken a thick one of the

1828
01:22:52,671 --> 01:22:54,020
face.
Did you see that one?

1829
01:23:01,610 --> 01:23:04,400
But I don't like even looking down at a 
woman's shirt.

1830
01:23:04,490 --> 01:23:07,480
Yeah.
My mother in law was doing the dishes at

1831
01:23:07,481 --> 01:23:09,070
our house.
She's wearing a nightgown.

1832
01:23:09,071 --> 01:23:10,660
Bent over and looked down her shirt.

1833
01:23:12,260 --> 01:23:12,650
Bad.

1834
01:23:18,420 --> 01:23:21,150
so fucking gross.
Oh,

1835
01:23:21,160 --> 01:23:23,360
how old was he at the time?
70 slash 30.

1836
01:23:25,000 --> 01:23:27,700
You know what?
They were full.

1837
01:23:27,940 --> 01:23:30,370
They were full and they weren't 
wrinkled.

1838
01:23:31,630 --> 01:23:36,630
And I thought this is what my,
what my wife's tits are gonna look like 

1839
01:23:36,630 --> 01:23:39,691
in 25 years,
unless she gets on that college and man 

1840
01:23:39,691 --> 01:23:40,420
is going to be great for everyone.

1841
01:23:40,670 --> 01:23:41,320
Duck duck,
duck,

1842
01:23:41,370 --> 01:23:43,820
duck.
It's going to be weird,

1843
01:23:43,821 --> 01:23:46,490
man.
Gonna see 80 year old hot ladies.

1844
01:23:46,730 --> 01:23:48,440
Yeah,
it's going to smell like a two year old.

1845
01:23:48,441 --> 01:23:51,850
So once they opened their mouth,
smelled tombs.

1846
01:23:51,910 --> 01:23:56,150
It's,
that's come flying out of there.

1847
01:23:58,800 --> 01:24:02,010
Fucking flies like that.
I just walk into a bikram yoga studio.

1848
01:24:02,210 --> 01:24:04,740
It'd be nice if you had an expiration 
date.

1849
01:24:05,010 --> 01:24:10,010
You'll work up to that date and 
everything worked awesome up until that 

1850
01:24:10,010 --> 01:24:10,830
date.
And then into the great aByss.

1851
01:24:12,240 --> 01:24:17,240
I think that should be an option.
I think that you should have total 

1852
01:24:17,240 --> 01:24:18,580
coverage for your health.
You know,

1853
01:24:18,710 --> 01:24:22,230
talk about universal healthcare,
fucking blue,

1854
01:24:22,470 --> 01:24:25,680
blue cross to the nth degree.
Everything you need,

1855
01:24:25,681 --> 01:24:27,360
$1 copay,
whatever.

1856
01:24:27,630 --> 01:24:31,200
But then when you turn 73,
they just come,

1857
01:24:31,470 --> 01:24:36,470
you're sleeping one bolt to the back of 
the head or you get a minimal policy.

1858
01:24:37,950 --> 01:24:39,990
Lot of copay,
big deductible.

1859
01:24:40,170 --> 01:24:42,300
But you get it for the rest of your life
as long as you live.

1860
01:24:42,840 --> 01:24:44,760
Yeah.
But the shooting you in the head part,

1861
01:24:45,970 --> 01:24:47,820
Why do they have to shoot you in the 
head of 73?

1862
01:24:48,150 --> 01:24:50,470
[inaudible] you.
You'll be a drain on the system and just

1863
01:24:50,610 --> 01:24:55,020
pay more money now because that money 
has to go back into the system.

1864
01:24:55,140 --> 01:24:57,410
YeaH.
But you're earning money for alive now.

1865
01:24:57,750 --> 01:24:58,800
Seventy four.
No.

1866
01:24:58,860 --> 01:25:01,260
Maybe you're one of those warren buffet 
type characters.

1867
01:25:01,290 --> 01:25:02,910
Still out there hustling.
That's true.

1868
01:25:03,310 --> 01:25:06,390
Do hustle loom.
You know he lIves in omaha,

1869
01:25:06,391 --> 01:25:07,950
Nebraska.
Sand hills.

1870
01:25:07,970 --> 01:25:10,890
He first had his kids in.
Now.

1871
01:25:10,990 --> 01:25:14,760
How's that possible coach?
How's nobody robbing him?

1872
01:25:15,180 --> 01:25:16,680
Right?
He flies.

1873
01:25:16,681 --> 01:25:17,880
Coach.
I believe so.

1874
01:25:17,881 --> 01:25:21,930
Or maybe that was sam walton that flies 
coach sam walton used to fly coach.

1875
01:25:22,710 --> 01:25:25,050
My only problem with that is why have 
all that money then?

1876
01:25:25,830 --> 01:25:26,610
What's he doing with it?

1877
01:25:26,640 --> 01:25:31,640
If I,
if I would think there's one thing you 

1878
01:25:31,640 --> 01:25:32,520
want to pay for the cost a little extra,
it's it's business class.

1879
01:25:32,521 --> 01:25:37,521
It makes a flight from exhausting and 
aggravating to relaxing and like if 

1880
01:25:37,711 --> 01:25:42,711
you're in first class,
you don't want to get off the fucking 

1881
01:25:42,711 --> 01:25:42,711
plane.
When you land,

1882
01:25:42,711 --> 01:25:42,930
you're sitting there,
you're watching a good movie,

1883
01:25:42,931 --> 01:25:47,931
you get some soft leather wrapped around
your dirty ass hole and you just got a 

1884
01:25:47,931 --> 01:25:51,890
little mimosa.
You're talking to interesting wealthy 

1885
01:25:51,890 --> 01:25:52,020
people sometimes.
Sometimes unit.

1886
01:25:52,040 --> 01:25:53,700
You're true to offer more on.
Yeah,

1887
01:25:53,701 --> 01:25:54,840
that's true.
I can happen to.

1888
01:25:55,110 --> 01:26:00,110
That should be part of for his class is 
just a fucking little urinal divider 

1889
01:26:00,421 --> 01:26:05,421
comes up in between you and that guy.
As soon as someone starts talking to 

1890
01:26:05,421 --> 01:26:05,421
you,
just

1891
01:26:05,421 --> 01:26:09,400
look at your eyes slowly.
Yeah.

1892
01:26:10,590 --> 01:26:12,320
There's some people you sit next to.
It's great,

1893
01:26:12,410 --> 01:26:13,780
but you can't choose.
Oh,

1894
01:26:13,900 --> 01:26:18,900
I was on the fucking plane the other day
headed back from vegas and there was a 

1895
01:26:18,900 --> 01:26:21,731
drunk guy that was doing air quotes 
business on the phone and he was so 

1896
01:26:21,891 --> 01:26:23,240
loud.
Tony and I were like,

1897
01:26:23,241 --> 01:26:25,340
what the fuck?
and he was like,

1898
01:26:25,570 --> 01:26:30,570
who?
Basically the bottom line is if we get 

1899
01:26:30,570 --> 01:26:31,520
this account,
we are set and he's drunk and he's being

1900
01:26:31,521 --> 01:26:36,521
real.
I think maybe he was doing it to let 

1901
01:26:36,521 --> 01:26:37,760
everyone know that he's doing because he
was definitely hammered.

1902
01:26:38,570 --> 01:26:43,570
The plane takes off and then within five
minutes of the flight being the air out 

1903
01:26:43,570 --> 01:26:45,710
cold,
snoring just drunk off his ass.

1904
01:26:45,740 --> 01:26:47,570
Probably stayed up all night,
got a flight,

1905
01:26:48,200 --> 01:26:53,200
pig alcohol.
He had seven runaway grinding on his 

1906
01:26:53,200 --> 01:26:53,930
cock to a van halen song about three 
hours earlier.

1907
01:26:54,680 --> 01:26:59,680
That's the good part.
Panama Panama just rocked out.

1908
01:27:02,760 --> 01:27:07,760
This van halen driving over here.
They came on the a sirius xm and eddie 

1909
01:27:07,760 --> 01:27:11,780
van halen is one of the greatest guitar 
players ever of all time.

1910
01:27:12,410 --> 01:27:14,870
Unquestionably is a bad motherfucker.
Yeah,

1911
01:27:14,990 --> 01:27:18,540
but valerie bertinelli.
Malley and prime.

1912
01:27:18,720 --> 01:27:20,730
Yeah.
That wreck.

1913
01:27:20,731 --> 01:27:22,610
That band though,
did she?

1914
01:27:22,611 --> 01:27:23,920
which she did.
She yoko it,

1915
01:27:24,230 --> 01:27:24,770
yeah.
Oh,

1916
01:27:24,771 --> 01:27:25,880
I didn't know that was.
Yeah,

1917
01:27:25,881 --> 01:27:30,881
that's what David Lee roth.
That's big part of why David Lee roth 

1918
01:27:30,881 --> 01:27:34,480
jettisoned during the prime days and 
then they turned it to sam hagar didn't 

1919
01:27:36,021 --> 01:27:38,940
enjoy one of those songs.
It was a different band.

1920
01:27:38,980 --> 01:27:40,590
Yeah.
It's weird because like I,

1921
01:27:40,591 --> 01:27:45,591
it was still super successful and maybe 
even more successful with sammy hagar 

1922
01:27:46,701 --> 01:27:49,250
than it was with David Lee roth,
but man,

1923
01:27:49,640 --> 01:27:52,070
it was not the same because different 
band entirely.

1924
01:27:52,220 --> 01:27:54,110
It was all,
it was weird.

1925
01:27:54,350 --> 01:27:59,350
It was weird.
It's not like acdc which just smoothly 

1926
01:27:59,350 --> 01:27:59,350
transitioned.
Yeah,

1927
01:27:59,350 --> 01:28:04,031
like you can't even tell you go listen 
to old acdc and then the new singer acdc

1928
01:28:04,220 --> 01:28:05,960
when that's,
which is old still now,

1929
01:28:06,350 --> 01:28:11,350
but it's all ecdc van halen to fucking 
massively different bands,

1930
01:28:12,890 --> 01:28:17,890
but just like that poppy bullshitty 
stuff that became massively,

1931
01:28:18,200 --> 01:28:20,300
massively successful.
Well,

1932
01:28:20,301 --> 01:28:23,840
it was like guys trying to be hard 
rockers.

1933
01:28:24,160 --> 01:28:29,160
It was,
it was like they were playing a 

1934
01:28:29,160 --> 01:28:30,971
character.
That's what sammy hagar always seemed 

1935
01:28:30,971 --> 01:28:30,971
like to me.

1936
01:28:31,400 --> 01:28:35,870
You can't drive 55 really can't even if 
there's a cop on the side of the road,

1937
01:28:35,871 --> 01:28:39,570
you'd like literally have to speed past 
the 55.

1938
01:28:39,571 --> 01:28:42,110
It a bullshit speed limit though.
That's why they got rid of it.

1939
01:28:42,560 --> 01:28:46,730
It's really 65 now,
but I mean if it says 65,

1940
01:28:46,731 --> 01:28:49,520
you can go 74.
You won't get pulled over.

1941
01:28:49,970 --> 01:28:51,740
You might want a porsche,
you will.

1942
01:28:51,760 --> 01:28:53,390
You can get pulled over.
You're a.

1943
01:28:53,391 --> 01:28:57,470
You're a a lightening rod and that thing
in any kind of car though,

1944
01:28:57,471 --> 01:29:00,230
if you're going 10 miles an hour over,
they can get you.

1945
01:29:00,340 --> 01:29:01,560
Not a press.
Really.

1946
01:29:01,860 --> 01:29:01,980
How

1947
01:29:01,980 --> 01:29:04,020
they just look at you on.
They feel so bad for you.

1948
01:29:04,050 --> 01:29:07,530
Bastard car doesn't even make noise.
I can't believe he goes,

1949
01:29:07,531 --> 01:29:08,130
I'm proud of you.

1950
01:29:08,240 --> 01:29:10,050
It's rolling down the hill like I'm 
fucking hot.

1951
01:29:10,051 --> 01:29:10,620
Wheels.
Car.

1952
01:29:13,460 --> 01:29:15,160
Look,
he's got golf clubs in the back.

1953
01:29:16,090 --> 01:29:17,290
How much?
HOw many gallons?

1954
01:29:17,360 --> 01:29:20,290
The gas.
How many miles to the gallon do yet?

1955
01:29:20,590 --> 01:29:25,590
You want to hear the sad part is this a 
button that you can push on your prius 

1956
01:29:25,590 --> 01:29:29,560
that that takes all the electricity off 
so that you just drive with the gas,

1957
01:29:29,980 --> 01:29:34,980
but it makes you like way faster and I 
pushed that every time so I don't even 

1958
01:29:34,980 --> 01:29:36,550
really get the savings.
Really.

1959
01:29:36,580 --> 01:29:39,340
It takes away now.
I don't know if it completely does,

1960
01:29:39,341 --> 01:29:41,140
but it gives you.
I'm telling you,

1961
01:29:41,141 --> 01:29:44,380
it is a quick car.
If you don't,

1962
01:29:44,381 --> 01:29:49,381
if you don't have the electricity thing 
turned on because it's so fucking light 

1963
01:29:49,381 --> 01:29:52,591
and aerodynamic,
quick telling you I line up on the 

1964
01:29:52,591 --> 01:29:54,920
fucking at a red light.
I line up against a mustang gts and they

1965
01:29:54,921 --> 01:29:58,120
just don't try to try or a prius.
That's right.

1966
01:29:58,260 --> 01:29:58,680
We,
we,

1967
01:29:58,690 --> 01:29:59,920
we raised for pink slips.

1968
01:30:02,660 --> 01:30:04,370
Well,
it's also has no gears,

1969
01:30:04,371 --> 01:30:08,090
right?
Just no gear one gear one fast.

1970
01:30:08,091 --> 01:30:08,990
Slow,
fast,

1971
01:30:08,991 --> 01:30:09,840
slow.
Yep.

1972
01:30:10,440 --> 01:30:13,010
How,
like if you fill your tank up with gas,

1973
01:30:13,220 --> 01:30:14,030
how long does it last?

1974
01:30:14,530 --> 01:30:16,300
I don't drive a lot.
I live on the west side.

1975
01:30:16,301 --> 01:30:17,320
I felt,
you know,

1976
01:30:17,321 --> 01:30:21,070
I drive three miles at a time.
Do you still miss venice?

1977
01:30:21,330 --> 01:30:23,440
Still miss Being in that little tight 
knit community?

1978
01:30:23,710 --> 01:30:24,040
Well,
you know,

1979
01:30:24,041 --> 01:30:25,670
I'm only a mile away.
right?

1980
01:30:26,050 --> 01:30:26,870
But uh,
I'm,

1981
01:30:26,871 --> 01:30:28,150
I'm there.
Yeah I miss it a lot.

1982
01:30:28,151 --> 01:30:32,140
It makes my quality of life is about 30 
percent worse.

1983
01:30:32,320 --> 01:30:37,320
Not living in that neighborhood.
I used to walk my dog and say how to 

1984
01:30:37,320 --> 01:30:37,320
seven people,
which I know we've talked about.

1985
01:30:37,320 --> 01:30:38,590
You don't love that.
I love that.

1986
01:30:38,591 --> 01:30:42,550
I like to be in contact with people.
I like to walk into houses.

1987
01:30:42,730 --> 01:30:44,130
Well,
it was like,

1988
01:30:44,131 --> 01:30:49,131
you know,
if you know on my block was duncan reu 

1989
01:30:49,131 --> 01:30:49,740
cowen,
joey diaz,

1990
01:30:49,741 --> 01:30:53,080
we'd have a fucking great time.
It will be against the goal,

1991
01:30:53,300 --> 01:30:56,790
a sack and all by house.
We'd have to all agree to live together.

1992
01:30:57,270 --> 01:31:00,660
Yeah.
We'd have to all find a spot that we all

1993
01:31:00,661 --> 01:31:03,210
agree to and.
But if you could engineer that,

1994
01:31:03,300 --> 01:31:08,300
that would be the pool and they have 
like a rec room where there's a pool 

1995
01:31:08,300 --> 01:31:10,330
table and a ping pong table documented 
don steam room.

1996
01:31:10,380 --> 01:31:15,380
You got to do is you've got to buy like 
a giant piece of land and then develop 

1997
01:31:15,380 --> 01:31:15,380
on it.
Right.

1998
01:31:15,380 --> 01:31:16,560
Develop your own little gated community.
Yep.

1999
01:31:17,070 --> 01:31:18,820
Call it a church.
Don't pay taxes.

2000
01:31:19,110 --> 01:31:20,600
Fuck all of each other's wives.
Right?

2001
01:31:21,240 --> 01:31:22,060
What?
Yeah,

2002
01:31:22,110 --> 01:31:24,690
that's what I do.
Take an acid koolaid,

2003
01:31:24,960 --> 01:31:27,870
whatever.
We got to do bikram yoga every morning.

2004
01:31:27,870 --> 01:31:29,670
Yoga.
We'll bring them in and he'll,

2005
01:31:29,880 --> 01:31:32,340
he'll be the leader.
Bring them,

2006
01:31:32,341 --> 01:31:37,341
put them on the hill.
Who started automotive engineering 

2007
01:31:37,341 --> 01:31:38,220
school.
There was warehouse.

2008
01:31:38,221 --> 01:31:40,040
Yeah.
Our kids will all Be fucking mechanics.

2009
01:31:40,890 --> 01:31:42,140
rolls royces.
Yeah.

2010
01:31:43,230 --> 01:31:44,970
Was anybody ever,
you know who's done that?

2011
01:31:45,270 --> 01:31:46,770
This guy,
uriah faber,

2012
01:31:46,800 --> 01:31:51,800
who's a former wec champion,
he's fighting for the ufc bantamweight 

2013
01:31:51,800 --> 01:31:52,050
title.
Great guy.

2014
01:31:52,320 --> 01:31:55,890
HumaN is a lot of his fighters.
They have a house on a cul de sac,

2015
01:31:56,490 --> 01:32:00,280
they call it the block,
bought a few houses in this area.

2016
01:32:00,330 --> 01:32:05,330
Swan,
one area because he buys and flips 

2017
01:32:05,330 --> 01:32:05,680
houses.
It's one of his side side gigs.

2018
01:32:05,980 --> 01:32:08,830
He buys houses and I believe his dad 
does construction.

2019
01:32:08,831 --> 01:32:11,140
His dad like refurbishes these houses 
and sells them.

2020
01:32:11,320 --> 01:32:15,220
So they bought some houses all on the 
same block and while he was a,

2021
01:32:15,670 --> 01:32:19,540
I think new year's eve,
some girl broke into his house,

2022
01:32:19,800 --> 01:32:21,880
um,
shit all over the place.

2023
01:32:21,880 --> 01:32:26,350
Threw up like some girl that didn't even
know she was hammered and she broke into

2024
01:32:26,351 --> 01:32:27,930
his house and he like,
uh,

2025
01:32:28,240 --> 01:32:33,240
I think he filmed it and put it on 
youtube or like put it on instagram or 

2026
01:32:33,240 --> 01:32:35,950
something like security cameras caught 
it or he know he was there.

2027
01:32:36,370 --> 01:32:41,370
He was There.
This girl that came into his house and 

2028
01:32:41,370 --> 01:32:42,550
she was just completely smashed.
He had no idea who she was.

2029
01:32:42,551 --> 01:32:45,110
So he just pulled out his ceiling,
started videotaping,

2030
01:32:45,140 --> 01:32:46,600
find that.
Yeah.

2031
01:32:46,780 --> 01:32:49,000
Just as an experiment.
Like let's see what she'll do.

2032
01:32:49,090 --> 01:32:50,230
Well,
I think he was like,

2033
01:32:50,231 --> 01:32:52,300
um,
this is not your house.

2034
01:32:52,301 --> 01:32:57,301
You have to leave.
And she was just so fucking smashed.

2035
01:32:58,031 --> 01:33:01,420
You didn't know where she was.
He could have been done to huxtable that

2036
01:33:01,421 --> 01:33:02,380
night.
Well,

2037
01:33:02,381 --> 01:33:05,260
I think she was relatively large.
Yeah.

2038
01:33:05,920 --> 01:33:08,350
Here it is.
Uriah favorites.

2039
01:33:08,410 --> 01:33:10,380
There was other guys there.
Yeah.

2040
01:33:10,750 --> 01:33:15,750
She locked herself in his bathroom.
So he's um,

2041
01:33:17,770 --> 01:33:20,860
he's walking with his phone to the 
bathroom.

2042
01:33:21,430 --> 01:33:23,320
See If you can skip through a lot of 
this.

2043
01:33:23,460 --> 01:33:28,460
They,
he's got it right to show this because 

2044
01:33:28,460 --> 01:33:31,620
it's his house.
Oh,

2045
01:33:32,680 --> 01:33:37,680
the cops showed up.
Now the cops are gonna kick the edited 

2046
01:33:37,680 --> 01:33:41,290
videos.
You don't have to get stuff.

2047
01:33:41,440 --> 01:33:42,280
Oh,
I see.

2048
01:33:42,281 --> 01:33:42,850
I see.

2049
01:33:43,420 --> 01:33:45,550
Do you do snapchat?
Do you have a snapchat?

2050
01:33:46,030 --> 01:33:50,020
I am not sure if I have it or not.
I do not have a snapshot.

2051
01:33:50,140 --> 01:33:55,140
But people liked that shit to snapchat.
Snapchat when it goes up and then you 

2052
01:33:55,140 --> 01:33:58,110
watch it and it comes down,
it goes away after a while.

2053
01:33:58,150 --> 01:34:00,580
Why would you want it to go away though?
I'm not sure.

2054
01:34:00,640 --> 01:34:05,640
I think you can keep it if you want.
You can make it stay there and it 

2055
01:34:05,640 --> 01:34:08,080
becomes like a story or something.
That's the new thing with all.

2056
01:34:09,130 --> 01:34:12,960
There's too many to periscope.
I have periscoped.

2057
01:34:12,961 --> 01:34:16,510
I stopped periscoping,
did it for awhile,

2058
01:34:17,350 --> 01:34:20,710
but I'm on brody stevens all the time.
You see him all the time.

2059
01:34:21,270 --> 01:34:23,020
periscopes,
every the greatest.

2060
01:34:23,310 --> 01:34:28,310
He puts his iphone on the holster and 
like periscopes on his way to work on 

2061
01:34:28,310 --> 01:34:28,380
his way to the store,
right?

2062
01:34:28,870 --> 01:34:29,560
Just talking.

2063
01:34:30,380 --> 01:34:33,340
Well joey diaz doing the morning smoke.
That's the greatest.

2064
01:34:33,370 --> 01:34:36,030
That's the greatest joe.
He gets up every morning and just,

2065
01:34:36,040 --> 01:34:37,750
I think he doesn't like 7:00
in the morning.

2066
01:34:37,751 --> 01:34:41,370
Smokes a joint and started talking.
It gives you the motivation.

2067
01:34:41,750 --> 01:34:46,750
Motivational insight from uncle joey 
come on in motherfuckers and he gets ah,

2068
01:34:49,750 --> 01:34:52,180
like ridiculously high and he's doing it
on camera.

2069
01:34:52,181 --> 01:34:54,310
You just keep seeing him hitting it and 
spoken.

2070
01:34:55,030 --> 01:34:56,920
That was one of the ones.
Where is he?

2071
01:34:56,930 --> 01:35:00,010
Uh,
he explained his beef with john capullo.

2072
01:35:00,250 --> 01:35:02,120
He had a beef with and keppra all.
Oh my god.

2073
01:35:02,121 --> 01:35:04,580
Legendary,
yeah,

2074
01:35:05,010 --> 01:35:10,010
play it played out on twitter where 
they're both going back and forth with 

2075
01:35:10,010 --> 01:35:10,010
each other.
Yeah.

2076
01:35:10,010 --> 01:35:12,320
And then it played out at the comedy 
store or joey apparently,

2077
01:35:12,321 --> 01:35:14,840
and him got into some sort of an 
altercation recently.

2078
01:35:14,930 --> 01:35:17,450
Physical joey spit in his face I think.

2079
01:35:19,580 --> 01:35:20,810
Was it a joke thief thing?

2080
01:35:21,060 --> 01:35:22,260
No,
no.

2081
01:35:23,170 --> 01:35:25,890
You would have to talk to both of them 
for to be,

2082
01:35:26,040 --> 01:35:30,600
for me to be fair for me to give you a 
real assessment of what happened,

2083
01:35:31,110 --> 01:35:36,110
but essentially it was his job,
his contention that john was trying to 

2084
01:35:37,641 --> 01:35:42,641
control the lineups and keep certain 
people from performing and ale that he 

2085
01:35:42,641 --> 01:35:47,471
fucked over the comedians doing so john 
copper rule denies this and it says that

2086
01:35:48,340 --> 01:35:53,120
joe is a bully and a prison yard asshole
and that kind of shit.

2087
01:35:53,121 --> 01:35:55,220
And so,
you know,

2088
01:35:55,370 --> 01:35:57,970
obviously my loyalTies with joey

2089
01:35:58,520 --> 01:36:00,830
joey sat all the way,
always thought capra.

2090
01:36:07,200 --> 01:36:09,030
I don't know what that guy did to me one
time.

2091
01:36:09,070 --> 01:36:09,750
Capullo yeah.

2092
01:36:09,830 --> 01:36:12,440
What'd he do?
He asked me,

2093
01:36:12,980 --> 01:36:15,290
can I be on your podcast?
And I'm like,

2094
01:36:15,840 --> 01:36:17,700
alright,
whatever.

2095
01:36:18,620 --> 01:36:23,620
So I give them a date time.
We come up with a date and a time and 

2096
01:36:23,620 --> 01:36:23,620
then uh,
like it's 11:00

2097
01:36:23,620 --> 01:36:25,520
and uh,
he,

2098
01:36:25,521 --> 01:36:26,780
uh,
I email him like,

2099
01:36:26,990 --> 01:36:28,370
where are you?
He's like,

2100
01:36:28,550 --> 01:36:29,110
oh,
uh,

2101
01:36:29,160 --> 01:36:34,160
I'm on my way,
but there's really thick traffic on the 

2102
01:36:34,160 --> 01:36:34,160
four.
Oh,

2103
01:36:34,160 --> 01:36:34,160
five.
And I looked,

2104
01:36:34,160 --> 01:36:35,390
you know,
I look it up on,

2105
01:36:35,391 --> 01:36:37,130
I maps this fucking.
It's all green.

2106
01:36:37,131 --> 01:36:40,250
Everything's great.
It's a pasture is no red lines.

2107
01:36:41,150 --> 01:36:42,080
And so I go,
all right,

2108
01:36:42,081 --> 01:36:46,400
well I'm here,
come whenever and then he emails me back

2109
01:36:46,401 --> 01:36:48,350
like 20 minutes,
like I'm fucking wasted my whole day.

2110
01:36:48,351 --> 01:36:48,990
And he's like,
uh,

2111
01:36:49,370 --> 01:36:53,930
it's not geographically optimal for me 
right now.

2112
01:36:55,110 --> 01:36:55,950
And Uh,

2113
01:36:56,060 --> 01:36:58,610
but I'm Free all day if you want to Come
into my house,

2114
01:36:59,170 --> 01:37:02,150
come to my house in the valley.
And I was just like,

2115
01:37:02,330 --> 01:37:03,110
delete.

2116
01:37:04,670 --> 01:37:04,990
Why?

2117
01:37:06,120 --> 01:37:07,630
Yeah.
Hm.

2118
01:37:09,390 --> 01:37:12,250
How odd.
Hmm.

2119
01:37:12,580 --> 01:37:14,680
I don't want to feed into a beef here.
Yeah,

2120
01:37:14,681 --> 01:37:16,210
I don't think you are,
but I think you're,

2121
01:37:16,270 --> 01:37:21,270
you know,
there's something going on there that's 

2122
01:37:21,270 --> 01:37:21,270
something weird.
Kind of controlling.

2123
01:37:21,270 --> 01:37:23,150
Yeah.
I don't know.

2124
01:37:23,180 --> 01:37:24,410
It might.
Who knows?

2125
01:37:24,860 --> 01:37:29,860
We could talk off air.
I could speculate with you off air 

2126
01:37:29,860 --> 01:37:33,460
involving all sorts of various things 
that people might get really excited 

2127
01:37:33,460 --> 01:37:37,661
about doing lot.
A lot of speculation.

2128
01:37:38,580 --> 01:37:40,460
He said I never had a problem with them.
I never.

2129
01:37:40,461 --> 01:37:42,050
I've never had a problem with them.
I don't know.

2130
01:37:42,100 --> 01:37:47,100
Now he's a good guy.
He thinks though that I somehow or 

2131
01:37:47,100 --> 01:37:47,160
another I'm involved in this and so his 
paranoia is fed into.

2132
01:37:47,660 --> 01:37:51,230
He thinks that joey diaz is my hitman 
and then somehow or another I'm plotting

2133
01:37:51,231 --> 01:37:53,390
against him,
which I don't even understand.

2134
01:37:53,750 --> 01:37:55,650
Why wouLd do that?
Like why I don't even.

2135
01:37:55,740 --> 01:37:55,980
I

2136
01:37:55,980 --> 01:37:58,110
don't know why I don't.
I don't get it.

2137
01:37:58,650 --> 01:38:00,240
Oh man.
Some people,

2138
01:38:00,241 --> 01:38:01,680
they tripped themselves.

2139
01:38:02,340 --> 01:38:05,760
Oh absolutely.
and the thing is about the comedy store.

2140
01:38:05,761 --> 01:38:07,600
As much as I love it,
sometimes that,

2141
01:38:07,810 --> 01:38:11,220
that shit gets.
It gets a little school yardi

2142
01:38:11,390 --> 01:38:12,740
not as much anymore,
man.

2143
01:38:13,010 --> 01:38:14,190
Tommy's gone.
Yeah.

2144
01:38:14,210 --> 01:38:19,210
I mean this is also because john was 
friends with tommy and that's also part 

2145
01:38:19,821 --> 01:38:24,170
of joey's contention is that he pulled 
up with tommy to control that place.

2146
01:38:25,610 --> 01:38:27,410
I don't know.
I don't give a fuck.

2147
01:38:27,500 --> 01:38:30,350
I go tell my jokes.
I say hi to people like you and hang out

2148
01:38:30,351 --> 01:38:32,030
with my friends.
I don't want to be involved.

2149
01:38:32,100 --> 01:38:34,760
I don't get to take 20 minutes early.
Say what's up?

2150
01:38:35,330 --> 01:38:40,330
All that shit is just a waste of time.
There's a lot of people out there that 

2151
01:38:40,330 --> 01:38:44,620
are living their lives.
Just sort of going with the momentum of 

2152
01:38:44,620 --> 01:38:48,581
all these things that people have to do,
all the gossipy things and get involved 

2153
01:38:48,581 --> 01:38:51,530
in controlling this thing about 
yourself.

2154
01:38:51,760 --> 01:38:54,350
Just think about what you're doing.
Don't get distracted and I can.

2155
01:38:54,470 --> 01:38:56,330
I think a lot of that is a distraction.

2156
01:38:56,360 --> 01:39:00,500
A lot of the people's fixating on other 
people at this fucking guy.

2157
01:39:00,501 --> 01:39:03,440
He's doing this so that fucking guy 
doing that and man,

2158
01:39:03,441 --> 01:39:06,170
he fucking why you need something funny 
was you getting on before me?

2159
01:39:06,650 --> 01:39:09,860
That is all distractions and it keeps 
you from thinking about yourself.

2160
01:39:09,980 --> 01:39:14,980
There's a lot of people had to spend a 
tremendous amount of time hating on 

2161
01:39:14,980 --> 01:39:18,011
other people and very little time 
working on themselves and it's a fucking

2162
01:39:18,081 --> 01:39:23,081
trap.
It's an easy trap to get into because 

2163
01:39:23,081 --> 01:39:23,081
it's.
It's,

2164
01:39:23,081 --> 01:39:26,740
there's no,
there's no commitment to hating on 

2165
01:39:26,740 --> 01:39:26,740
someone.
You don't,

2166
01:39:26,740 --> 01:39:27,710
there's no consequences if it doesn't go
well.

2167
01:39:27,860 --> 01:39:30,680
So you put your energy into that and you
know,

2168
01:39:30,681 --> 01:39:35,681
almost like you're like hoping they fail
so that it justifies this idea that you 

2169
01:39:35,681 --> 01:39:36,890
have in your head,
but you're not,

2170
01:39:36,980 --> 01:39:37,690
you're not benefiting

2171
01:39:37,840 --> 01:39:39,610
and it's wasting.
You can waste a day,

2172
01:39:39,700 --> 01:39:44,700
you can still about something and all of
a sudden it's the end of the day and 

2173
01:39:44,700 --> 01:39:47,971
that was shit that you want it to 
accomplish that you didn't do because 

2174
01:39:47,971 --> 01:39:51,511
you were obsessed with fucking googling 
the person and finding out if it's a 

2175
01:39:51,791 --> 01:39:55,180
story that people are latching onto.
This whole thing with joey,

2176
01:39:55,420 --> 01:39:57,610
I'm sure it's wasted more of his time 
that he wanted it to.

2177
01:39:57,740 --> 01:40:02,740
Yeah,
but he put it on periscope and it's 

2178
01:40:02,740 --> 01:40:02,740
pretty amazing.
he did.

2179
01:40:02,740 --> 01:40:05,730
Yeah.
And he's smoking pot while he's talking 

2180
01:40:05,730 --> 01:40:05,870
about.
Let me explain to you what that did.

2181
01:40:10,210 --> 01:40:10,750
I don't know.

2182
01:40:13,540 --> 01:40:15,250
Ah,
why do people love it so much?

2183
01:40:15,590 --> 01:40:16,390
No,
I don't know.

2184
01:40:16,391 --> 01:40:21,310
Why do I love it?
I don't love it with everybody though.

2185
01:40:21,550 --> 01:40:23,320
With joey.
It's just entertaining.

2186
01:40:23,410 --> 01:40:24,700
Yeah.
I don't know why.

2187
01:40:24,701 --> 01:40:29,701
I love him so much when,
when he's involved in something I'm 

2188
01:40:29,701 --> 01:40:29,860
involved with,
I like it or not,

2189
01:40:30,250 --> 01:40:31,990
I have to be,
you know,

2190
01:40:32,470 --> 01:40:37,470
but it's um,
there's a lot of wasted energy is my 

2191
01:40:37,470 --> 01:40:37,470
point,
you know,

2192
01:40:37,470 --> 01:40:38,220
and even with joe,
he's,

2193
01:40:38,221 --> 01:40:40,150
he's done with it now.
He won't even talk about it now.

2194
01:40:40,220 --> 01:40:40,960
Bring it up now.
It was,

2195
01:40:40,961 --> 01:40:42,730
I don't give a fuck.
I don't give a fuck.

2196
01:40:42,731 --> 01:40:45,040
Joe rogan,
I murdered them at san jose.

2197
01:40:49,070 --> 01:40:54,070
He's just out there smashing.
He's hit a whole new level recently to 

2198
01:40:54,070 --> 01:40:54,070
has he.
Oh my

2199
01:40:54,070 --> 01:40:56,520
god,
he's got this bit I don't want,

2200
01:40:56,580 --> 01:40:58,330
I don't want to give up any of the 
details of the bit,

2201
01:40:58,331 --> 01:41:00,710
but he's got this bit where it just 
like,

2202
01:41:00,750 --> 01:41:05,110
I'm just like the frenzy that he 
approaches this bit with on stage.

2203
01:41:05,111 --> 01:41:05,730
So like,
wow,

2204
01:41:05,750 --> 01:41:08,470
he's on another level.
He's like hitting new levels.

2205
01:41:08,840 --> 01:41:09,080
Well,
I,

2206
01:41:09,210 --> 01:41:10,450
I had to follow him at the,
uh,

2207
01:41:10,451 --> 01:41:14,080
in the main room of the store recently 
and he went up and he,

2208
01:41:14,560 --> 01:41:17,350
people were doubled over.
They couldn't even make noise.

2209
01:41:17,351 --> 01:41:22,351
It was,
it was just cruel what he did to this 

2210
01:41:22,351 --> 01:41:22,351
audience.
And then,

2211
01:41:22,351 --> 01:41:22,420
you know,
in the,

2212
01:41:22,421 --> 01:41:24,940
in a comedy story,
each act brings up the next act.

2213
01:41:24,941 --> 01:41:28,360
So he introduces me and then I come up 
and he shakes my hand and he whispers in

2214
01:41:28,361 --> 01:41:29,920
my ear.
Sorry dude.

2215
01:41:36,600 --> 01:41:41,600
No,
I couldn't follow it right out of the 

2216
01:41:41,600 --> 01:41:42,080
gate.
Oh yeah man,

2217
01:41:42,120 --> 01:41:43,420
he's a monster.
Yeah.

2218
01:41:43,560 --> 01:41:46,740
He murdered in vegas and I was with him 
in vegas two weeks ago.

2219
01:41:46,830 --> 01:41:51,830
A coffee at or 2000 people.
It's fucking de Roy Roy.

2220
01:41:55,020 --> 01:41:57,760
He's a monster.
He's just a,

2221
01:41:57,810 --> 01:42:02,810
he's hit this level right now where he's
just so free and loose and he's 

2222
01:42:02,810 --> 01:42:05,670
concentrating on standup so much.
He's really into it,

2223
01:42:05,671 --> 01:42:07,470
you know,
and he's reaping the rewards.

2224
01:42:07,471 --> 01:42:11,580
Like finally people recognizing like he 
sells out everywhere now I can advance.

2225
01:42:12,000 --> 01:42:16,050
So finally people are recognizing how 
talented he is and how dedicated is.

2226
01:42:16,280 --> 01:42:20,400
I mean it's really just one of those 
examples of focus and attention.

2227
01:42:20,700 --> 01:42:23,580
Equally results,
focusing on something,

2228
01:42:23,581 --> 01:42:26,610
really honing it and really putting your
focus and your attention on something.

2229
01:42:26,611 --> 01:42:31,611
And then seeing the results of it.
He's just really passionate right now 

2230
01:42:31,611 --> 01:42:31,611
about stand up.

2231
01:42:31,611 --> 01:42:35,900
He's always been.
But right now because he's getting so 

2232
01:42:35,900 --> 01:42:38,361
much love and he's just,
he's just constantly selling out 

2233
01:42:38,361 --> 01:42:39,840
everywhere,
crushing it.

2234
01:42:40,230 --> 01:42:45,230
So he's like really like feeling 
energized or went through the same 

2235
01:42:45,230 --> 01:42:47,550
thing.
He just put massive focus on,

2236
01:42:47,551 --> 01:42:49,260
you know,
he just one of those guys,

2237
01:42:49,261 --> 01:42:50,220
he,
you know,

2238
01:42:50,550 --> 01:42:54,360
he would put writing and performing 
ahead of other things.

2239
01:42:54,960 --> 01:42:55,530
It'd be like,
hey man,

2240
01:42:55,560 --> 01:42:57,840
and do a podcast.
I can't for the next two months,

2241
01:42:57,841 --> 01:43:00,660
I'm just focusing on standup.
That's a.

2242
01:43:01,510 --> 01:43:02,940
Well that's the way to do it,
right?

2243
01:43:03,420 --> 01:43:05,640
I mean you can always focus more.
Right?

2244
01:43:05,641 --> 01:43:10,290
And I think for me the balance has 
always been focusing so much that I lose

2245
01:43:10,291 --> 01:43:11,850
some passion for it.
You know,

2246
01:43:11,851 --> 01:43:16,851
like,
like sometimes I take a couple of days 

2247
01:43:16,851 --> 01:43:18,801
off and I come back hot juvenate it,
like last night was really fucking fun.

2248
01:43:20,310 --> 01:43:21,300
We did this benefit.

2249
01:43:21,300 --> 01:43:26,300
Brian cowen had a benefit last night.
We did it in the main room and so last 

2250
01:43:26,300 --> 01:43:28,980
night was tuesday,
so I didn't work sunday or monday,

2251
01:43:29,040 --> 01:43:32,820
so taking sunday or monday off.
I came in tuesday like fired up.

2252
01:43:32,821 --> 01:43:37,821
But it's nice you get like.
So I think there's this balance of like 

2253
01:43:37,821 --> 01:43:40,440
letting it go,
living life and then concentrating again

2254
01:43:40,470 --> 01:43:45,470
coming back at it.
Like if you grow it's like grinding too 

2255
01:43:45,470 --> 01:43:47,700
much is not good either becAuse then you
lose a little bit of focus.

2256
01:43:47,880 --> 01:43:52,010
It's like this weird balance to achieve 
is also a balance between the

2257
01:43:52,010 --> 01:43:57,010
road and in town.
Like if I go on the ride just to three 

2258
01:43:57,010 --> 01:43:59,240
weeks in a row on the road I came back,
I took off like you know,

2259
01:43:59,241 --> 01:44:04,241
for four days or something.
and then when I went out it was like 

2260
01:44:04,241 --> 01:44:08,291
when you had been running with weights 
and all of a sudden you're like doing a 

2261
01:44:08,291 --> 01:44:11,020
10 whatever,
15 minute spot at the comedy store in 

2262
01:44:11,020 --> 01:44:13,070
front of a hot crowd.
And it was like just fucking effortless.

2263
01:44:13,071 --> 01:44:14,960
it was like you were floating above the 
room going like,

2264
01:44:14,961 --> 01:44:15,770
yeah,
now I'll do,

2265
01:44:15,860 --> 01:44:17,660
I'll throw this in,
I'll throw like,

2266
01:44:18,020 --> 01:44:20,660
just toying with them having such a 
blast.

2267
01:44:20,870 --> 01:44:24,080
We know it's also those long sets that 
you do on the road.

2268
01:44:24,081 --> 01:44:25,890
That's what brings everything together.
Yeah.

2269
01:44:25,970 --> 01:44:30,970
When you do in like a headlining set and
you're doing an hour and 10 and just 

2270
01:44:30,970 --> 01:44:34,391
some just sort of sorting it all out and
putting it all together and you get 

2271
01:44:34,401 --> 01:44:37,250
loose and you just do it like friday 
night,

2272
01:44:37,251 --> 01:44:40,370
two shows,
saturday two shows and then it gets just

2273
01:44:40,371 --> 01:44:45,371
so smooth.
Comedy is in a lot of ways like 

2274
01:44:45,371 --> 01:44:45,371
exercise,
you know,

2275
01:44:45,371 --> 01:44:47,060
you definitely shape.
You get in shape for it.

2276
01:44:47,210 --> 01:44:48,710
Yeah.
And also like exercise,

2277
01:44:48,711 --> 01:44:50,320
you need recovery right?

2278
01:44:51,740 --> 01:44:54,500
When we were young we didn't recover.
I mean I used to work six,

2279
01:44:54,501 --> 01:44:59,501
seven nights a week every week,
year round and I kind of need that when 

2280
01:44:59,501 --> 01:44:59,870
you're starting out.

2281
01:45:00,180 --> 01:45:03,390
Well we were so we were like colt right 
out of there,

2282
01:45:03,800 --> 01:45:05,070
out of the horses,
pussy.

2283
01:45:05,071 --> 01:45:10,071
We just didn't know how to walk or get 
on stage to get our stage legs.

2284
01:45:13,790 --> 01:45:15,990
You know,
that's a.

2285
01:45:16,170 --> 01:45:17,880
I don't know,
it's a strange thing,

2286
01:45:17,881 --> 01:45:22,881
comedy,
because you really think was after all 

2287
01:45:22,881 --> 01:45:24,510
these years that you would have it down,
but you don't really.

2288
01:45:24,780 --> 01:45:26,370
You always,
you're always geTting better.

2289
01:45:26,400 --> 01:45:28,710
You always,
you always have to stay on top of it.

2290
01:45:29,430 --> 01:45:32,010
Never a,
I wonder if music is like that.

2291
01:45:32,280 --> 01:45:35,070
I wonder if.
I guess it must be because musicians are

2292
01:45:35,100 --> 01:45:37,510
notorious for their practice.
Yeah.

2293
01:45:38,610 --> 01:45:42,240
That's one thing that I think I kind of 
envy about musicians,

2294
01:45:42,241 --> 01:45:46,140
like they have to be disciplined.
They have to practice.

2295
01:45:46,500 --> 01:45:51,500
they can't practice in front of a crowd.
I think can't go in front of a crowd 

2296
01:45:51,500 --> 01:45:53,040
with a half ass song and hope it comes 
together because the crowds hot.

2297
01:45:53,270 --> 01:45:54,410
Yeah.
You know,

2298
01:45:54,510 --> 01:45:59,510
he can't talk to the crowd halfway 
through because you didn't finish 

2299
01:45:59,510 --> 01:45:59,510
writing.
Yeah.

2300
01:45:59,510 --> 01:45:59,530
Like,
uh,

2301
01:45:59,820 --> 01:46:02,910
someone said something about ian 
edwards,

2302
01:46:03,000 --> 01:46:03,610
like,
uh,

2303
01:46:03,950 --> 01:46:04,680
you know,
the ian,

2304
01:46:04,681 --> 01:46:05,460
like,
oh man,

2305
01:46:05,461 --> 01:46:07,680
he's fucking writing.
He's always writing.

2306
01:46:07,681 --> 01:46:08,980
He's always putting stuff together.
Like,

2307
01:46:08,981 --> 01:46:10,680
yeah,
shouldn'T we all be doing that man?

2308
01:46:10,920 --> 01:46:11,880
Like,
yeah,

2309
01:46:11,881 --> 01:46:12,990
I guess.
So he was like,

2310
01:46:12,991 --> 01:46:13,830
hey,
guess what?

2311
01:46:13,831 --> 01:46:14,850
I like to write on stage.
Well,

2312
01:46:14,851 --> 01:46:16,650
yeah,
because it's fucking easier that way.

2313
01:46:16,980 --> 01:46:21,980
You go onstage with a halfass premise 
and you're forced to kind of put it 

2314
01:46:21,980 --> 01:46:21,980
together.
Yeah.

2315
01:46:21,980 --> 01:46:21,980
Yeah.

2316
01:46:21,980 --> 01:46:23,770
It's just fear that keeps you from 
sitting down and doing it.

2317
01:46:24,100 --> 01:46:29,100
I think people feel like maybe they're 
not that strong of a writer and there 

2318
01:46:29,100 --> 01:46:31,300
they sit down and they're almost afraid 
that it won't come together,

2319
01:46:31,301 --> 01:46:33,320
but then when you have the energy of 
being onstage,

2320
01:46:33,400 --> 01:46:34,300
then you know,
you can,

2321
01:46:34,330 --> 01:46:35,830
you can use that.
BuT um,

2322
01:46:36,340 --> 01:46:37,960
it's just,
it's slower,

2323
01:46:38,020 --> 01:46:39,580
you know,
writing off stage,

2324
01:46:39,581 --> 01:46:43,240
it takes longer because you're just not,
you're energy is not as high,

2325
01:46:43,600 --> 01:46:48,600
but you can lay down the idea at least 
in the structure and then maybe it'll 

2326
01:46:48,600 --> 01:46:50,720
get funnier on stage,
but you can't start from scratch.

2327
01:46:51,170 --> 01:46:53,480
Some people can,
some people do,

2328
01:46:53,750 --> 01:46:56,420
buT I think everybody would benefit from
both.

2329
01:46:56,600 --> 01:47:01,600
Right?
I think everybody would benefit from ad 

2330
01:47:01,600 --> 01:47:01,600
living on stage and everybody would 
benefit from writing more.

2331
01:47:01,940 --> 01:47:03,710
That's what I try to tell young comics.
I'm like,

2332
01:47:03,711 --> 01:47:05,270
man,
you force yourself to write.

2333
01:47:05,600 --> 01:47:08,930
Even if you only write an hour a day to 
sit down for an hour a day,

2334
01:47:09,050 --> 01:47:14,050
just force yourself to go over some 
ideas and they will blossom and they 

2335
01:47:14,050 --> 01:47:16,130
will fucking find a way to make it out 
to that stage.

2336
01:47:16,330 --> 01:47:18,550
And they may not right away sometimes,
like,

2337
01:47:19,000 --> 01:47:24,000
I haven't done this in awhile,
but I bought a note book about a month 

2338
01:47:24,000 --> 01:47:24,000
ago.
I started writing long hand again,

2339
01:47:24,000 --> 01:47:28,261
you know,
read the paper for a little while or 

2340
01:47:28,261 --> 01:47:30,211
just muse listened to sets that I did on
stage and maybe I started a little 

2341
01:47:30,211 --> 01:47:32,770
tangent and you know,
write that up and I just fucking fill in

2342
01:47:32,771 --> 01:47:35,800
this notebook and it's not all making it
right into my act,

2343
01:47:35,801 --> 01:47:38,500
but some of it is,
some of it goes into the podcast.

2344
01:47:38,501 --> 01:47:41,980
It's kind of like just a running journal
that I can draw from.

2345
01:47:42,340 --> 01:47:45,910
But I've had bits that I've started a 
year before and pounded it,

2346
01:47:46,270 --> 01:47:51,270
believed in it,
kept trying to try to hit my head 

2347
01:47:51,270 --> 01:47:53,491
against what doesn't work.
And then you pick it up against six 

2348
01:47:53,491 --> 01:47:53,500
months ago and it just click.
It's like you found it,

2349
01:47:54,370 --> 01:47:57,160
but it has to sit late in your brain 
sometimes for it to work.

2350
01:47:57,670 --> 01:48:00,430
Yeah.
SomeTimes a thing can happen in life and

2351
01:48:00,431 --> 01:48:04,000
that thing in life opens up a door like 
and you go,

2352
01:48:04,060 --> 01:48:06,150
oh,
I could approach it this way.

2353
01:48:06,151 --> 01:48:06,670
or,
oh,

2354
01:48:06,671 --> 01:48:08,890
I'm looking at it the wrong way,
or oh,

2355
01:48:08,891 --> 01:48:11,710
of course it's this,
you know,

2356
01:48:11,980 --> 01:48:16,060
and I think that's the same way with any
kind of creative writing.

2357
01:48:16,300 --> 01:48:17,950
Anything,
whether you're writing stories,

2358
01:48:17,951 --> 01:48:22,951
you're writing a blog,
like sometimes you just have to go 

2359
01:48:22,951 --> 01:48:23,260
outside of it,
you write some stuff down,

2360
01:48:23,261 --> 01:48:25,690
then you go outside of it live your life
and then reapproach it.

2361
01:48:25,780 --> 01:48:30,780
Yeah.
And then like every day my perspective 

2362
01:48:30,780 --> 01:48:30,780
shifts at least a little bit.
You know,

2363
01:48:30,780 --> 01:48:33,270
you have like core values and things you
believe in and things you,

2364
01:48:33,280 --> 01:48:35,110
you,
you agree with and don't agree with,

2365
01:48:35,410 --> 01:48:40,410
but every day like some things will 
happen in life that make you look at 

2366
01:48:40,410 --> 01:48:40,840
things a little bit of a different way,
you know,

2367
01:48:40,841 --> 01:48:43,900
especially when it comes to current 
events and politics in the world.

2368
01:48:43,900 --> 01:48:45,750
And lIke everyday,
like people go,

2369
01:48:45,751 --> 01:48:50,751
oh man,
you were so wishy washy with some of 

2370
01:48:50,751 --> 01:48:50,751
your ideas.
Well yeah,

2371
01:48:50,751 --> 01:48:50,830
they,
they're flexible,

2372
01:48:50,831 --> 01:48:55,831
they're moving around a lot and 
especially when it comes to things that 

2373
01:48:55,831 --> 01:48:59,281
are happening in the world.
And I think sometimes you just gotta 

2374
01:48:59,281 --> 01:49:00,700
like,
like let those things.

2375
01:49:00,840 --> 01:49:05,840
Like let let your thoughts sort of roll 
around without trying to constantly 

2376
01:49:05,840 --> 01:49:06,820
define them and then reapproach the 
idea.

2377
01:49:06,970 --> 01:49:08,290
Then come back to the,
to the,

2378
01:49:08,470 --> 01:49:13,470
to the original notebook or the original
piece that you wrote and look at it 

2379
01:49:13,470 --> 01:49:16,561
again maybe a week later and go,
well now that I've experienced a couple 

2380
01:49:16,561 --> 01:49:17,860
of things in life this week and look at 
the world a little bit.

2381
01:49:18,510 --> 01:49:21,400
One of the things that tom seger and 
christina palicki do,

2382
01:49:21,460 --> 01:49:23,830
We had a conversation that christina and
I the other day,

2383
01:49:24,350 --> 01:49:29,350
she said that they used to do their 
podcast twice a week and decided to Go 

2384
01:49:29,350 --> 01:49:29,350
back to doing it once a week and I was 
like,

2385
01:49:29,420 --> 01:49:30,610
how come?
And she goes,

2386
01:49:30,880 --> 01:49:35,880
I think it's good to live to live your 
life and then have some shit to talk 

2387
01:49:35,880 --> 01:49:37,660
about.
Like if you do too many of them,

2388
01:49:37,870 --> 01:49:42,870
then sometimes you,
you're just talking shit and doesn't 

2389
01:49:42,870 --> 01:49:43,180
doesn't necessarily mean to you.

2390
01:49:43,380 --> 01:49:48,380
Well,
especially because for them it's about 

2391
01:49:48,380 --> 01:49:48,380
their relationship and what's in it.
So

2392
01:49:48,380 --> 01:49:53,120
you know,
they're not bringing in a new guest who 

2393
01:49:53,120 --> 01:49:53,120
can bring new ideas.
they're talking about their life.

2394
01:49:53,970 --> 01:49:55,060
Well,
they occasionally have guests,

2395
01:49:55,061 --> 01:49:56,140
but yeah,
for the most part,

2396
01:49:56,141 --> 01:50:01,141
yeah.
That's the way to avoid it is to have 

2397
01:50:01,141 --> 01:50:01,141
guests.
Right.

2398
01:50:01,141 --> 01:50:04,740
People were selling.
How do you talk to people for three 

2399
01:50:04,740 --> 01:50:04,740
hours,
five days a week?

2400
01:50:04,740 --> 01:50:08,570
Well,
they're fucking interesting people and 

2401
01:50:08,570 --> 01:50:08,570
it's not hard just you just have cool 
conversations.

2402
01:50:08,570 --> 01:50:09,690
Yeah,
right now.

2403
01:50:09,700 --> 01:50:12,450
But if you don't,
if you just do it yourself,

2404
01:50:12,451 --> 01:50:14,470
like bill burroughs and most amazing 
one.

2405
01:50:14,550 --> 01:50:16,450
Yeah.
Because bill doesn't even have a fucking

2406
01:50:16,480 --> 01:50:17,350
guest.
Yeah.

2407
01:50:17,470 --> 01:50:18,190
And he,
uh,

2408
01:50:18,200 --> 01:50:19,680
he's got a couple of ideas and some 
shit.

2409
01:50:19,681 --> 01:50:21,520
He wants to talk about some things that 
happened,

2410
01:50:21,550 --> 01:50:23,170
but he just rambles.
Yeah.

2411
01:50:23,710 --> 01:50:24,910
By himself.
Yeah.

2412
01:50:24,911 --> 01:50:29,911
I started doing a thing.
I've done about five of them now called 

2413
01:50:29,911 --> 01:50:30,790
the sunday papers where I just,
I get the sunday paper and I read it and

2414
01:50:30,791 --> 01:50:32,380
I just make some notes and then I just 
hit,

2415
01:50:32,440 --> 01:50:34,030
hit record and I go for an hour.

2416
01:50:34,090 --> 01:50:36,250
That's a sunday paper.
I'm going to do one.

2417
01:50:36,251 --> 01:50:41,251
I'm going to be on vacation this week 
after this weekend and when I go on 

2418
01:50:41,251 --> 01:50:46,021
vacation from doing the podcast,
I'm going to put up like a little 

2419
01:50:46,021 --> 01:50:46,750
instagram question mark and I'm gonna 
say just asked me some questions,

2420
01:50:46,830 --> 01:50:51,830
throw some questions that I'm just 
answer some of the questions on the 

2421
01:50:51,830 --> 01:50:55,370
phone.
I'm going to be on vacation with the 

2422
01:50:55,370 --> 01:50:55,370
family.
Yes,

2423
01:50:55,370 --> 01:50:55,600
my friend.
Yeah,

2424
01:50:55,601 --> 01:50:58,960
there you go.
I'll need more of that right now in this

2425
01:50:58,961 --> 01:50:59,620
life.
More.

2426
01:50:59,621 --> 01:51:02,980
Relax.
You ever gone to Colorado next week?

2427
01:51:03,010 --> 01:51:04,810
Ski I thought were going to say get 
high.

2428
01:51:05,240 --> 01:51:06,100
Get high.
Well,

2429
01:51:06,101 --> 01:51:06,790
I'll probably get.
Hi.

2430
01:51:06,820 --> 01:51:11,820
I'm doing shows,
but then we're going to get a less key 

2431
01:51:11,820 --> 01:51:11,820
after that.
Which part?

2432
01:51:11,820 --> 01:51:11,820
Aspen.
I don't know.

2433
01:51:11,830 --> 01:51:15,100
We just kInd of a rented a car.
We'll go get.

2434
01:51:15,310 --> 01:51:20,310
Get on 70 west.
Maybe stop and breckenridge or maybe go 

2435
01:51:20,310 --> 01:51:20,310
to vail.

2436
01:51:20,310 --> 01:51:21,060
I know already.
Just went to vail.

2437
01:51:21,100 --> 01:51:23,070
his broke his ankle.
Broke his ankle out there.

2438
01:51:23,130 --> 01:51:24,580
Yeah,
flux game.

2439
01:51:25,330 --> 01:51:26,710
Oh really?
You're not a scare.

2440
01:51:26,990 --> 01:51:28,660
I learned it pretty hard last time I 
went.

2441
01:51:28,740 --> 01:51:30,490
Yeah.
A couple of months ago,

2442
01:51:30,940 --> 01:51:33,370
not even a month ago.
Month ago.

2443
01:51:33,371 --> 01:51:36,700
Wiped shin bone and I was at and you 
just said,

2444
01:51:36,701 --> 01:51:38,710
I'm done with this.
Like this is so ridiculous.

2445
01:51:39,250 --> 01:51:41,110
Why do things that are more fun?
Yeah.

2446
01:51:41,500 --> 01:51:42,850
I do a lot of things that are really 
fun,

2447
01:51:42,851 --> 01:51:44,200
so skiing is like,
don't get hurt,

2448
01:51:44,201 --> 01:51:45,480
don't get hurt.
Don't dad.

2449
01:51:45,620 --> 01:51:47,480
No,
that's who we go bowling.

2450
01:51:47,530 --> 01:51:49,750
That's true.
it's almost like the entire.

2451
01:51:49,960 --> 01:51:52,870
The entire aDventure is based on not 
breaking something.

2452
01:51:52,871 --> 01:51:55,540
It's like the tension between.
Yeah,

2453
01:51:55,541 --> 01:52:00,541
the scenery is nice and all that,
but really you're thinking don't get 

2454
01:52:00,541 --> 01:52:00,541
hurt.
Yeah.

2455
01:52:00,541 --> 01:52:03,720
I mean I get it,
I get it and it's a fun time for me to 

2456
01:52:03,720 --> 01:52:03,720
be with my family.

2457
01:52:03,720 --> 01:52:03,720
Yeah,
it's fun.

2458
01:52:03,720 --> 01:52:04,830
It's fun.
The kids love skiing.

2459
01:52:04,930 --> 01:52:06,520
It's a good time.
I don't mind doing it.

2460
01:52:06,560 --> 01:52:09,100
Puts just got to slow down.
Where are you going fast?

2461
01:52:09,250 --> 01:52:14,250
I wasn't even going that fast.
I Called a little bit faster than it 

2462
01:52:14,250 --> 01:52:14,250
should,
but you catch an edge.

2463
01:52:14,250 --> 01:52:16,990
I don't know what happened.
I don't remember what happened,

2464
01:52:17,730 --> 01:52:20,650
but I remember as I was falling going,
oh,

2465
01:52:20,830 --> 01:52:23,200
this one might be a bad one.
Yeah,

2466
01:52:23,260 --> 01:52:28,260
I'm good at rolliNg though.
Like I know how to not fall too bad,

2467
01:52:28,361 --> 01:52:29,740
so I was fine,
but I was like,

2468
01:52:29,760 --> 01:52:31,300
ooh.
That was a hard hit.

2469
01:52:31,301 --> 01:52:31,780
Yeah,
I,

2470
01:52:31,820 --> 01:52:33,370
I walked out of it.
No probleM.

2471
01:52:33,371 --> 01:52:35,320
Put my ski back on.
Skied down the mountain.

2472
01:52:35,350 --> 01:52:36,890
He has fun,
but it like,

2473
01:52:37,180 --> 01:52:39,970
people get fucked up doing this.
Oh yeah.

2474
01:52:40,000 --> 01:52:41,980
Yeah.
I get carried away too.

2475
01:52:42,150 --> 01:52:43,390
Yeah.
You're supposed to wear a helmet.

2476
01:52:43,570 --> 01:52:44,710
I wear a helmet.
Oh you do?

2477
01:52:44,910 --> 01:52:45,830
No.
Yeah.

2478
01:52:46,850 --> 01:52:50,000
You doN't know really?
Maybe I will wear a helmet.

2479
01:52:50,560 --> 01:52:55,560
Right?
My friend got knocked the fuck out last 

2480
01:52:55,560 --> 01:52:56,370
year.
Snowboarding and he was jack for awhile.

2481
01:52:56,400 --> 01:52:57,220
Um.
Yeah.

2482
01:52:57,230 --> 01:53:01,250
He just fucking woopsies landed 
completely on his head.

2483
01:53:01,370 --> 01:53:04,310
His feet went up in the air and he just 
boom.

2484
01:53:04,610 --> 01:53:08,060
Headfirst all head back or front 
somewhere.

2485
01:53:08,061 --> 01:53:09,710
He doesn't know.
He doesn't know.

2486
01:53:09,711 --> 01:53:11,530
He went out shit.
Yeah,

2487
01:53:11,540 --> 01:53:13,130
just thump.
Yeah.

2488
01:53:13,600 --> 01:53:15,600
And by the way,
that thumb could be thump.

2489
01:53:15,610 --> 01:53:16,850
Snap.
Oh,

2490
01:53:16,880 --> 01:53:19,010
guess what?
Now you're moving around with a straw.

2491
01:53:19,490 --> 01:53:20,560
You have a strong rather.

2492
01:53:22,600 --> 01:53:25,070
And that's how you navigate through 
life.

2493
01:53:25,190 --> 01:53:27,800
Yeah.
All because you were into like a thrill.

2494
01:53:28,310 --> 01:53:33,310
Well,
what abOut the scan and trees going 

2495
01:53:33,310 --> 01:53:35,691
between the trees?
Where it's grooves you're going between 

2496
01:53:35,691 --> 01:53:38,891
trees and where your skis go are like 
deep grooves that your ski has to go 

2497
01:53:38,891 --> 01:53:43,781
directly into and if you catch an edge 
you flip over like a fucking tree.

2498
01:53:45,020 --> 01:53:45,830
I mean,
I get it,

2499
01:53:45,950 --> 01:53:47,330
I get the people like it,
but like,

2500
01:53:47,331 --> 01:53:52,331
um,
my friend aubrey is good friends with 

2501
01:53:52,331 --> 01:53:53,090
bodie miller.
He's the olympic ski guy.

2502
01:53:53,360 --> 01:53:55,600
Just mangled his fucking leg.
Yeah.

2503
01:53:55,640 --> 01:53:59,570
He just wiped out and crashed into 
something and just fucked his leg up.

2504
01:53:59,630 --> 01:54:02,540
Take us 60 miles an hour.
Jesus christ,

2505
01:54:02,740 --> 01:54:06,780
but make even guys are that good still 
wipe out fuck themselves out.

2506
01:54:06,800 --> 01:54:11,800
Yeah.
It just seems like there's a lot of fun 

2507
01:54:11,800 --> 01:54:11,860
shit that I like to do that.

2508
01:54:11,860 --> 01:54:16,860
Like that's one of the reasons why I 
didn't start skiing until late in life 

2509
01:54:16,860 --> 01:54:19,480
because I did jujitsu and all these 
other things that already are dangerous 

2510
01:54:19,480 --> 01:54:19,480
for your body.
And I'm like,

2511
01:54:19,480 --> 01:54:21,470
it's probably like limit the amount of 
dangerous shit.

2512
01:54:21,670 --> 01:54:23,470
That's why I wouldn't ride a motorcycle.
I'm like,

2513
01:54:23,970 --> 01:54:25,580
it's probably back off of that.
Yeah.

2514
01:54:26,030 --> 01:54:28,820
I started playing ice hockey again a few
weeks ago.

2515
01:54:29,240 --> 01:54:32,000
Get comedians got a little league gulen.
Bill supposed to be good,

2516
01:54:32,001 --> 01:54:32,360
right?
Yeah.

2517
01:54:32,361 --> 01:54:35,490
He plays in it.
And steve byrne and ian,

2518
01:54:36,230 --> 01:54:37,450
great exercise.
You know,

2519
01:54:37,490 --> 01:54:42,490
it's not dangerous because we don't hit 
each other and you don't really ever 

2520
01:54:42,490 --> 01:54:43,610
fuck up a knee or an ankle and hockey 
because it's ice.

2521
01:54:43,660 --> 01:54:44,530
You slide,
you know,

2522
01:54:44,580 --> 01:54:47,450
it doesn't stick and turn.
You just kind of slide.

2523
01:54:47,451 --> 01:54:50,270
And so unless you trip and fall into a 
wall,

2524
01:54:50,271 --> 01:54:53,790
you're pretty safe.
Bobby or mangled nice man.

2525
01:54:53,940 --> 01:54:58,940
Daddy,
bobby or used to come to the gym that I 

2526
01:54:58,940 --> 01:55:00,980
worked at when I was a kid.
I worked aT the boston athletic center,

2527
01:55:01,340 --> 01:55:03,350
which was the boston athletic club,
I guess it was.

2528
01:55:03,620 --> 01:55:04,610
And that was,
um,

2529
01:55:05,000 --> 01:55:07,790
I was 18,
I guess 18,

2530
01:55:07,791 --> 01:55:08,720
19,
something like that.

2531
01:55:09,020 --> 01:55:11,600
And um,
bobby or was this legend,

2532
01:55:11,630 --> 01:55:12,860
you know,
this hockey legend.

2533
01:55:12,861 --> 01:55:14,630
He was an older by then,
you know,

2534
01:55:14,631 --> 01:55:19,631
long retired,
but he would come into the gym and he 

2535
01:55:19,631 --> 01:55:23,261
couldn't even fucking walk and we would 
have to help him climb onto the 

2536
01:55:23,261 --> 01:55:23,440
versaclimber,
you know,

2537
01:55:23,441 --> 01:55:27,900
the versaclimber that pole and you go up
and down and down with.

2538
01:55:28,340 --> 01:55:32,110
You'd have to help him pick his legs up 
because his knees don't bash.

2539
01:55:32,140 --> 01:55:37,140
They don't.
They don't completely lock out and 

2540
01:55:37,140 --> 01:55:37,140
they'll completely bend.
It's like this.

2541
01:55:37,140 --> 01:55:38,720
So it's like the one thing he can do in 
the gym.

2542
01:55:38,740 --> 01:55:40,250
Yeah.
He goes from this like,

2543
01:55:40,370 --> 01:55:42,740
um,
like from completely straight.

2544
01:55:42,770 --> 01:55:45,630
He's like five degrees.
Like ben,

2545
01:55:45,660 --> 01:55:49,890
he's always bent and then it only goes 
to like maybe 15 degrees.

2546
01:55:50,450 --> 01:55:55,450
Yeah.
It's like this tiny amount of bend that 

2547
01:55:55,450 --> 01:55:56,580
he hasn't because he's had just massive 
surgeries all through his knees.

2548
01:55:57,420 --> 01:55:59,670
What you watch them walk,
there's his knee.

2549
01:56:00,220 --> 01:56:01,660
Damn.

2550
01:56:02,310 --> 01:56:04,830
With all the cuts on his knees.
And by the way,

2551
01:56:04,831 --> 01:56:05,730
that is,
uh,

2552
01:56:06,150 --> 01:56:10,200
that's back in the olden days and look 
at the different operations.

2553
01:56:10,201 --> 01:56:11,490
Seventy three,
72,

2554
01:56:11,491 --> 01:56:13,170
71.
Oh,

2555
01:56:13,230 --> 01:56:14,780
69,
1970.

2556
01:56:14,880 --> 01:56:15,750
Oh my god.
Yeah.

2557
01:56:15,751 --> 01:56:17,760
You know how bad the equipment was back 
then?

2558
01:56:17,761 --> 01:56:22,761
The skates were like a saws.
The skates were bad and the surgeries 

2559
01:56:23,161 --> 01:56:28,161
were terrible.
TheY didn't know how to fix you and 

2560
01:56:28,161 --> 01:56:28,161
would fix you and you just go,
right.

2561
01:56:28,161 --> 01:56:29,930
We'll look at,
go up up above that.

2562
01:56:29,960 --> 01:56:32,400
You could see his knee like that.
Yeah.

2563
01:56:32,700 --> 01:56:34,960
Look at that fucking thing.
Jesus christ.

2564
01:56:35,370 --> 01:56:37,380
That is brutal.
It Was awful.

2565
01:56:38,010 --> 01:56:39,000
Oh,
is it someone else's name?

2566
01:56:39,270 --> 01:56:40,710
Oh,
his,

2567
01:56:40,740 --> 01:56:43,920
uh,
just watching him walk and he would play

2568
01:56:43,930 --> 01:56:47,310
racquetball and I'd watched him play 
racquetball and he would just fall down.

2569
01:56:47,510 --> 01:56:49,350
Yeah.
He would just like try to like,

2570
01:56:49,351 --> 01:56:52,380
move forward and he just fall is,
couldn't move.

2571
01:56:52,400 --> 01:56:57,400
Yeah.
I mean he was basically left with pegs 

2572
01:56:57,400 --> 01:56:57,630
that barely bent.
Yeah.

2573
01:56:57,690 --> 01:56:59,670
And that's how he got around.
It's like left,

2574
01:56:59,820 --> 01:57:00,480
right?
Peg,

2575
01:57:00,481 --> 01:57:01,570
right peg.
Left pay.

2576
01:57:01,640 --> 01:57:04,910
Yeah.
Lot of hockey players or they play golf,

2577
01:57:04,980 --> 01:57:06,890
you know,
they retire and they play a lot of golf.

2578
01:57:06,891 --> 01:57:11,810
That's like a big sports in Canada or 
golf and hockey.

2579
01:57:12,190 --> 01:57:17,190
Same swank.
Slapshot in a golf swing are pretty 

2580
01:57:17,190 --> 01:57:17,190
similar.
oh,

2581
01:57:17,190 --> 01:57:17,190
that's happy madison.
Right?

2582
01:57:17,190 --> 01:57:17,600
Right.
That's why.

2583
01:57:17,850 --> 01:57:21,050
That's right.
See Israel Israel science behind it.

2584
01:57:23,030 --> 01:57:23,810
But uh,
no,

2585
01:57:23,860 --> 01:57:28,860
I,
I think that a football players are the 

2586
01:57:28,860 --> 01:57:31,211
worst.
Those guys you see any football player 

2587
01:57:31,211 --> 01:57:32,240
after they finished playing and they're 
fucking stumbling around.

2588
01:57:32,320 --> 01:57:32,620
Yeah.

2589
01:57:32,750 --> 01:57:34,940
They're mangled.
Some of them not,

2590
01:57:35,180 --> 01:57:36,080
you know,
it's interesting.

2591
01:57:36,170 --> 01:57:38,720
Some of them are really lucid.
They get through like michael irvin.

2592
01:57:39,110 --> 01:57:41,960
michael irvin is super lucid.
You've got no problems.

2593
01:57:41,961 --> 01:57:43,880
I mean maybe he's banged up a little 
bit,

2594
01:57:44,090 --> 01:57:45,650
but he can walk around.
Oh yeah,

2595
01:57:45,710 --> 01:57:46,370
yeah,
he's fine.

2596
01:57:46,371 --> 01:57:47,810
He looks great.
He looks great.

2597
01:57:47,811 --> 01:57:48,890
Talks great.
Yeah.

2598
01:57:49,070 --> 01:57:50,290
He's an interesting guy.
Matt.

2599
01:57:50,300 --> 01:57:52,000
very fucking smart dude.
Yeah,

2600
01:57:52,220 --> 01:57:54,020
very smart guy.
Big ufc fan.

2601
01:57:54,050 --> 01:57:56,240
I talked to them all autonomouS.
Seem at the matches,

2602
01:57:56,320 --> 01:57:58,220
so no shit.
Fantastic guy.

2603
01:57:58,310 --> 01:58:00,370
Wow.
Does he do sPortscasting?

2604
01:58:00,820 --> 01:58:02,690
Um,
I'm sure he does.

2605
01:58:03,780 --> 01:58:04,540
Does he?
Yeah,

2606
01:58:04,670 --> 01:58:06,440
jamie's knows.
And sunday morning stuff.

2607
01:58:06,500 --> 01:58:08,000
Yeah.
With that.

2608
01:58:08,001 --> 01:58:11,240
Uh,
I think the guy michael strahan,

2609
01:58:12,100 --> 01:58:13,240
that guy from that show,
he.

2610
01:58:13,241 --> 01:58:15,650
Yeah.
He's so annoying.

2611
01:58:15,710 --> 01:58:16,400
Why is he doing?

2612
01:58:17,120 --> 01:58:20,470
He's just trying so hard to be likable.
I just don't buy it.

2613
01:58:20,620 --> 01:58:22,580
It just feels hollow anD we.
Well,

2614
01:58:22,610 --> 01:58:23,900
I love that.
Kelly late.

2615
01:58:24,230 --> 01:58:29,230
I could watch her all fucking day.
That's why you don't like them to think 

2616
01:58:29,230 --> 01:58:32,520
he's saving the dicker way.
If I don't like the black white 

2617
01:58:32,520 --> 01:58:32,890
relationships in general,
disturb you.

2618
01:58:32,960 --> 01:58:34,780
They Just feel wrong.
I mean,

2619
01:58:34,880 --> 01:58:39,880
I was boRn in [inaudible] 66 when things
are normal because back in the olden 

2620
01:58:40,700 --> 01:58:42,190
days before the colors mixed,

2621
01:58:43,390 --> 01:58:48,390
when a man could get water from a 
drinking fountain and not worry about 

2622
01:58:48,390 --> 01:58:48,390
it.
Do you think he's given her the dick?

2623
01:58:48,820 --> 01:58:50,140
I don't,
but I.

2624
01:58:50,200 --> 01:58:52,420
And it's not sexual with her.
It is sexual,

2625
01:58:52,660 --> 01:58:55,670
but it's also,
I think that she is really.

2626
01:58:55,690 --> 01:58:57,550
You're fucking.
No I don't.

2627
01:58:57,910 --> 01:59:00,850
I'd look at that fake smiles.
I really don't like them,

2628
01:59:02,350 --> 01:59:07,350
you know?
Do you really have a problem with black 

2629
01:59:07,350 --> 01:59:07,350
white relationships?
Not really right now,

2630
01:59:07,350 --> 01:59:11,200
but I have a problem with his phoniness 
and just that she deserves better.

2631
01:59:12,390 --> 01:59:17,050
She deserves regis.
Regis was the best regis in her.

2632
01:59:17,080 --> 01:59:20,650
That's part of my problem is regis 
withdrawal will read this is doing other

2633
01:59:20,651 --> 01:59:22,730
shit now.
Like he didn't stop working.

2634
01:59:22,820 --> 01:59:24,040
He had to life though,
man.

2635
01:59:24,041 --> 01:59:25,720
You know what he used to do to prep for 
that show.

2636
01:59:26,260 --> 01:59:28,930
Get picked up by a limo,
get handed the paper,

2637
01:59:28,960 --> 01:59:31,390
read it on the way to the studio and 
fucking go on there.

2638
01:59:31,450 --> 01:59:34,870
That's all he dId.
Just off the top of his head when he was

2639
01:59:34,871 --> 01:59:36,670
so relaxed.
Comfortable.

2640
01:59:36,760 --> 01:59:38,410
Yeah.
When do I stop doing it?

2641
01:59:39,730 --> 01:59:41,960
Maybe that,
the grind to doing it every week.

2642
01:59:41,961 --> 01:59:43,810
He did it for a lot of years,
so.

2643
01:59:44,420 --> 01:59:46,760
But he still has a show.
He has a show.

2644
01:59:47,000 --> 01:59:52,000
Yeah.
He still is some show that I saw and it 

2645
01:59:52,000 --> 01:59:54,461
was weird.
It was unlike access tv or something 

2646
01:59:54,461 --> 01:59:54,461
like one of the smaller networks.
yeah.

2647
01:59:54,461 --> 01:59:55,520
So I guess he's probably just doing that
for fun,

2648
01:59:55,930 --> 02:00:00,930
you know,
just to stay active or something like 

2649
02:00:00,930 --> 02:00:00,930
that.
Like regis philbin show.

2650
02:00:01,290 --> 02:00:02,690
He's,
I'm sure he's got something.

2651
02:00:02,720 --> 02:00:04,460
Yeah.
I don't know what it is,

2652
02:00:04,580 --> 02:00:05,680
but he,
um,

2653
02:00:06,080 --> 02:00:07,940
I think he decided I don't want to do it
anymore.

2654
02:00:08,030 --> 02:00:10,610
Yeah.
I mean I guess it's like a jay leno when

2655
02:00:10,611 --> 02:00:12,710
he walked away.
Yeah.

2656
02:00:12,711 --> 02:00:16,310
But jay's doing that car show now.
That's what I mean in any wanted to do a

2657
02:00:16,311 --> 02:00:17,390
little something to stay busy.

2658
02:00:17,410 --> 02:00:19,750
Well you did the car show while he was 
doing the tonight show.

2659
02:00:19,751 --> 02:00:20,500
DAddy.
Yeah.

2660
02:00:20,530 --> 02:00:24,970
But the car show is so much more him.
He's so much better on.

2661
02:00:25,150 --> 02:00:26,540
Yeah.
He's so busy.

2662
02:00:27,310 --> 02:00:32,310
Well he's,
he's a fucking legitimate car 

2663
02:00:32,310 --> 02:00:33,130
aficionados and nut.
He's a nut.

2664
02:00:33,160 --> 02:00:36,150
He fucking loves cars.
So when you're with him and you,

2665
02:00:36,180 --> 02:00:38,590
you talking to him about cars,
like he,

2666
02:00:38,591 --> 02:00:42,400
his eyes light up,
he gets excited and it's fun.

2667
02:00:42,401 --> 02:00:43,990
I did a show that.
Yeah,

2668
02:00:44,040 --> 02:00:44,560
we,
we,

2669
02:00:44,561 --> 02:00:46,690
uh,
drove my 65 corvette.

2670
02:00:46,750 --> 02:00:47,150
Yeah.
Yeah.

2671
02:00:47,200 --> 02:00:48,130
And he's,
you know,

2672
02:00:48,220 --> 02:00:49,990
he's great.
He's great.

2673
02:00:49,991 --> 02:00:54,130
I mean if the public knew him as only 
that and you know,

2674
02:00:54,131 --> 02:00:55,650
and he,
he'll admitted.

2675
02:00:55,690 --> 02:01:00,690
He's like,
that was part of the problem with doing 

2676
02:01:00,690 --> 02:01:02,401
that show is like I had to talk to 
people but I don't give a fuck about 

2677
02:01:02,401 --> 02:01:05,791
your sitcom or yeah,
you're fucking stupid album that comes 

2678
02:01:05,791 --> 02:01:05,791
out.
Like he didn't care.

2679
02:01:05,860 --> 02:01:10,860
But if he's got you on his car show,
it's because he's legitimately 

2680
02:01:10,860 --> 02:01:11,240
interested in your car.
That's it.

2681
02:01:11,350 --> 02:01:14,380
That's the only reason why he does it.
He's got all the money in the world.

2682
02:01:14,430 --> 02:01:19,430
It doesn't give a fuck.
He's only doing it for his own 

2683
02:01:19,430 --> 02:01:19,430
enjoyment.

2684
02:01:19,430 --> 02:01:24,070
Yeah.
I can remember seeing letterman with 

2685
02:01:24,070 --> 02:01:24,070
like a country music star on.
And you knew that.

2686
02:01:24,070 --> 02:01:24,560
He just wanted to say what the fuck?
Yeah.

2687
02:01:24,561 --> 02:01:24,760
Yeah,

2688
02:01:25,150 --> 02:01:27,090
especially like pop country.
Yeah.

2689
02:01:27,190 --> 02:01:32,190
Some wack dude with some designer 
fucking cowboy hat on and boots and he's

2690
02:01:33,071 --> 02:01:37,660
never worn before and they're all shiny 
and fake and his face doesn't change.

2691
02:01:37,780 --> 02:01:40,070
Fake samson is right when you see

2692
02:01:40,070 --> 02:01:42,420
a country guy with the fake rips in his 
jeans.

2693
02:01:42,560 --> 02:01:44,480
Oh,
how dare you.

2694
02:01:45,890 --> 02:01:49,190
You're not a working man.
How'd you get those ribs bottom?

2695
02:01:49,240 --> 02:01:50,380
Yeah.
BoughT those ribS.

2696
02:01:50,381 --> 02:01:53,120
You fucked her assistant.
Go out and get riPped or we are,

2697
02:01:53,121 --> 02:01:54,620
you get the uh,
the hipsters,

2698
02:01:54,621 --> 02:01:57,320
they go out and they buy work boots used
that already are like,

2699
02:01:57,610 --> 02:01:59,770
have somebody working in them.
Yeah.

2700
02:02:00,130 --> 02:02:01,890
Yeah.
You gotta wear your own work boots.

2701
02:02:01,970 --> 02:02:04,250
Fuck man.
Fuck yeah.

2702
02:02:04,310 --> 02:02:07,250
Live your life.
I got a pair of timberlands.

2703
02:02:07,251 --> 02:02:10,160
I got about 15,
20 years ago.

2704
02:02:10,250 --> 02:02:10,960
Really?
Yeah.

2705
02:02:10,961 --> 02:02:13,090
They feel nice.
Timberlands and greatest.

2706
02:02:13,230 --> 02:02:16,700
They last so good.
There were big in the hip hop community.

2707
02:02:16,820 --> 02:02:18,740
Oh yeah.
How'd that happen?

2708
02:02:19,820 --> 02:02:21,080
I don't know,
but I know that,

2709
02:02:21,081 --> 02:02:22,010
um,
when,

2710
02:02:22,370 --> 02:02:22,880
when

2711
02:02:24,420 --> 02:02:29,420
don,
was it Dom perignon what one of the 

2712
02:02:29,420 --> 02:02:29,850
brands that get kind of co opted by?
Hip hop was a crystal.

2713
02:02:29,860 --> 02:02:34,860
Yeah,
it was crystal and they were very upset 

2714
02:02:34,860 --> 02:02:35,950
that hip hop had taken over because here
they are like this elite,

2715
02:02:36,220 --> 02:02:37,690
you know,
blue collar,

2716
02:02:37,960 --> 02:02:39,190
white collar,
kind of a.

2717
02:02:39,640 --> 02:02:44,640
Yeah,
but they started complaining about it 

2718
02:02:44,640 --> 02:02:44,640
and then the hip hop community rejected.
That's right.

2719
02:02:44,640 --> 02:02:48,890
Your fucking sales plummeted.
That's interesting.

2720
02:02:49,380 --> 02:02:51,100
You've got to take that money Where you 
get it,

2721
02:02:51,330 --> 02:02:53,470
but you have a great champagne.
What do you give a fuck?

2722
02:02:53,740 --> 02:02:56,260
If rapper start buying rolls royces,
you're goIng to be upset.

2723
02:02:56,310 --> 02:02:56,890
Yeah.
No,

2724
02:02:56,940 --> 02:03:01,940
come on bitch.
Even if they're spilling your champion 

2725
02:03:01,940 --> 02:03:01,940
on the floor,
it sounds like racism to me,

2726
02:03:01,940 --> 02:03:03,940
as long as it's not spilling it with a 
white person,

2727
02:03:04,600 --> 02:03:06,010
let them spill it with themselves.

2728
02:03:09,730 --> 02:03:14,730
Is weird.
How certain drinks get associated with 

2729
02:03:14,730 --> 02:03:16,800
certain races.
Like crevasse ea is a black drank,

2730
02:03:16,870 --> 02:03:17,410
right?
All right.

2731
02:03:17,411 --> 02:03:18,940
I'll name a drink.
You tell me the race.

2732
02:03:20,200 --> 02:03:22,060
I'm fucked.
Ripple.

2733
02:03:22,450 --> 02:03:23,300
Ripple.
Yeah.

2734
02:03:23,410 --> 02:03:24,460
Oh,
that's bark,

2735
02:03:24,461 --> 02:03:25,100
right?
Yeah.

2736
02:03:25,110 --> 02:03:28,100
The wine manischewitz they know.
I know that is outdated.

2737
02:03:28,180 --> 02:03:33,180
I am at sanford because redd foxx used 
to rip away.

2738
02:03:34,900 --> 02:03:36,670
That's the only way.
I don't even know what it looks like.

2739
02:03:36,671 --> 02:03:38,350
I've never seen it.
He has no.

2740
02:03:38,980 --> 02:03:40,230
Alright.
Um,

2741
02:03:40,920 --> 02:03:42,760
manischewitz oh,
juice,

2742
02:03:42,930 --> 02:03:44,350
right.
Um,

2743
02:03:44,800 --> 02:03:46,680
bailey's irish cream,
irish breathable,

2744
02:03:47,630 --> 02:03:51,700
and it was an easy one.
I'm budweiser,

2745
02:03:52,090 --> 02:03:57,090
a white people with marital problems.
Were they caused by the budweiser or 

2746
02:03:57,911 --> 02:04:00,760
just placated by the budweiser?
All of the above.

2747
02:04:01,450 --> 02:04:02,350
It's in the mix.

2748
02:04:06,120 --> 02:04:06,900
Champagne

2749
02:04:09,510 --> 02:04:13,420
who paUsed?
Shampoo other than like new year's eve.

2750
02:04:14,470 --> 02:04:16,150
New year's eve is kind of universal,
right?

2751
02:04:16,180 --> 02:04:20,830
Everybody gets champagne and celebrating
shit.

2752
02:04:20,860 --> 02:04:24,870
Like weddings who fucked by champagne on
a normal basis.

2753
02:04:24,900 --> 02:04:26,190
French people.
Really?

2754
02:04:26,550 --> 02:04:28,320
French people drank it.
That makes sense.

2755
02:04:28,560 --> 02:04:29,370
Well,
this tasty.

2756
02:04:29,520 --> 02:04:32,770
Yeah.
But what about americans?

2757
02:04:33,670 --> 02:04:35,710
White assholes.
But they drank.

2758
02:04:35,770 --> 02:04:36,810
No,
if you're white asshole,

2759
02:04:36,820 --> 02:04:38,300
you drink champagne.
Yeah.

2760
02:04:39,180 --> 02:04:40,730
Yeah.
I was thinking of one person

2761
02:04:40,960 --> 02:04:41,490
say,
okay,

2762
02:04:41,710 --> 02:04:43,210
say it later.
I'll say it later,

2763
02:04:44,810 --> 02:04:45,860
although,
you know,

2764
02:04:46,400 --> 02:04:49,160
when I used to work as a banquet waiter 
at the marriott in boston,

2765
02:04:49,161 --> 02:04:52,160
we used to do these banquets and 
sometimes they'd come in and they'd,

2766
02:04:52,490 --> 02:04:57,490
they'd order.
I'm a dom perignon and I'll tell you 

2767
02:04:57,490 --> 02:04:58,430
what,
man you get.

2768
02:04:58,490 --> 02:05:01,490
It's the best high.
If bad champagne gives you a headache.

2769
02:05:01,640 --> 02:05:03,230
It's nasty.
It's sugary,

2770
02:05:03,630 --> 02:05:08,630
which is usually sparkling wine.
It's not champagne actual to call it 

2771
02:05:08,630 --> 02:05:10,520
champagne.
It has to be from this certain region of

2772
02:05:10,521 --> 02:05:15,521
France.
The only place you can get it to put 

2773
02:05:15,521 --> 02:05:15,521
champagne on the label.
Oh,

2774
02:05:15,521 --> 02:05:19,570
that's right.
And dom perignon is the best and I'm 

2775
02:05:19,570 --> 02:05:19,570
telling you,
man,

2776
02:05:19,570 --> 02:05:20,480
that shit,
it makes you feel so good.

2777
02:05:20,481 --> 02:05:22,790
It tastes so good.
No hangover,

2778
02:05:23,720 --> 02:05:24,750
hangover,
no hang.

2779
02:05:24,770 --> 02:05:25,190
Well,
not,

2780
02:05:25,440 --> 02:05:27,410
not.
Not like champagne hangover,

2781
02:05:27,411 --> 02:05:32,411
which is the worst hangover you can get.
Is there really a difference in 

2782
02:05:32,411 --> 02:05:32,411
hangovers?
Oh yeah.

2783
02:05:32,411 --> 02:05:33,200
What's the difference?
Sugar,

2784
02:05:33,290 --> 02:05:34,160
sugar,
content,

2785
02:05:34,730 --> 02:05:36,950
sugar content.
Hangovers are all about sugar.

2786
02:05:37,380 --> 02:05:38,790
Fucking sugar,
right?

2787
02:05:39,420 --> 02:05:42,180
As I explained to me by Carl Hart,
Dr.

2788
02:05:42,180 --> 02:05:43,860
Carl Hart,
who was an addiction specialist,

2789
02:05:43,861 --> 02:05:48,861
he said,
what hangovers really are is your body 

2790
02:05:48,861 --> 02:05:51,450
got temporarily addicted to the alcohol.
The feeling that you have,

2791
02:05:51,451 --> 02:05:54,150
the headache and all that,
a lot of is dehydration,

2792
02:05:54,151 --> 02:05:59,151
but a lot of is also the compensatory 
mechanisms that your body puts in place 

2793
02:05:59,151 --> 02:06:01,470
to process the alcohol.
Your body literally shifts.

2794
02:06:01,471 --> 02:06:06,471
It's sort of scheduling shifts.
It's a organizing of of chemicals and 

2795
02:06:07,501 --> 02:06:12,501
all the shit that's in your brain and 
then once the alcohol is not there 

2796
02:06:12,501 --> 02:06:16,131
anymore,
it's not processing alcohol anymore and 

2797
02:06:16,131 --> 02:06:18,891
then you have this like and that's the 
compensatory mechanisms flooding their 

2798
02:06:19,891 --> 02:06:22,380
way through your system.
That's also why people say,

2799
02:06:22,381 --> 02:06:27,381
here are the dog.
That bit you like when you have a 

2800
02:06:27,381 --> 02:06:27,381
hangover and you have like a bloody mary
in the morning.

2801
02:06:27,381 --> 02:06:32,150
It helps you a little bit,
soothes you over that hump because it's 

2802
02:06:32,150 --> 02:06:32,220
poisonous.

2803
02:06:32,310 --> 02:06:33,870
Alcohol is poison.
It's your system.

2804
02:06:33,871 --> 02:06:34,770
Yes,
yes.

2805
02:06:34,820 --> 02:06:39,820
It's so.
It's counterintuitive that like more 

2806
02:06:39,820 --> 02:06:42,051
alcohol would help you feel better,
but the way Carl Hart explains it is 

2807
02:06:42,051 --> 02:06:43,350
that it's your body.
Your body recognizes,

2808
02:06:43,351 --> 02:06:48,351
okay,
there's this shit I have to process and 

2809
02:06:48,351 --> 02:06:50,920
let's deal with that so it compensates 
for that shit and then that shit's not 

2810
02:06:50,920 --> 02:06:51,330
there anymore and it's like,
what's going on?

2811
02:06:51,420 --> 02:06:52,680
Where's all the,
what are we doing?

2812
02:06:52,710 --> 02:06:54,670
We set up to deal with alcohol.
You know,

2813
02:06:54,671 --> 02:06:59,671
we don't have to deal with it anymore.
I had him on a couple of times and he's 

2814
02:06:59,671 --> 02:06:59,700
a fascinating,
fascinating guy,

2815
02:07:00,180 --> 02:07:01,650
very,
very smart guy.

2816
02:07:01,651 --> 02:07:06,330
And knows so much about it,
about addictions and about,

2817
02:07:06,360 --> 02:07:07,440
um,
about,

2818
02:07:07,470 --> 02:07:12,470
uh,
various drugs and the reactions to the 

2819
02:07:12,470 --> 02:07:14,301
body and all the myths that people have.
It's amazing how many myths that people 

2820
02:07:14,301 --> 02:07:16,880
have about like how hard things are to 
kick and when,

2821
02:07:16,900 --> 02:07:18,790
what is instantly addictive.
Yeah.

2822
02:07:19,310 --> 02:07:20,180
So that's.
What did he say?

2823
02:07:20,181 --> 02:07:24,290
Because I hear cigarettes are the most 
addictive cigarettes.

2824
02:07:24,291 --> 02:07:25,640
Um,
yes,

2825
02:07:25,641 --> 02:07:27,410
it's cigarettes are more addictive than 
heroin.

2826
02:07:27,560 --> 02:07:29,030
Cigarettes are super,
super addictive.

2827
02:07:29,060 --> 02:07:29,270
Yeah.

2828
02:07:29,380 --> 02:07:30,610
Super directive.
Well,

2829
02:07:30,640 --> 02:07:35,640
they've done.
Did you ever see that movie with russel 

2830
02:07:35,640 --> 02:07:35,640
crowe inside?
Man?

2831
02:07:35,680 --> 02:07:36,310
Yes.
The,

2832
02:07:36,340 --> 02:07:38,140
we're about the cigarette industry,
about a.

2833
02:07:38,141 --> 02:07:43,141
I'm a scientist that's working with the 
cigarettes to try to make them more 

2834
02:07:43,141 --> 02:07:45,760
addictive and that goes out with it,
which is apparently a real story.

2835
02:07:46,230 --> 02:07:48,530
But then they were sued and they lost 
it.

2836
02:07:48,820 --> 02:07:53,820
They know that's what it doesn't mean 
they've engineered them and the 

2837
02:07:53,820 --> 02:07:53,820
addictive.
Right.

2838
02:07:53,820 --> 02:07:55,380
But um,
pot though is not,

2839
02:07:55,381 --> 02:07:57,330
they say not physically addictive at 
all.

2840
02:07:57,360 --> 02:07:58,380
No,
not physically,

2841
02:07:58,410 --> 02:08:00,470
but it can be emotionally addictive.
Anything

2842
02:08:00,480 --> 02:08:01,410
can,
you know,

2843
02:08:01,760 --> 02:08:03,780
like a girl could be emotionally 
addictive.

2844
02:08:03,820 --> 02:08:05,280
Should we outlaw girls,
you know,

2845
02:08:05,380 --> 02:08:10,380
like a Jerking off.
Can be a mo emotionally and 

2846
02:08:10,380 --> 02:08:10,980
psychologically addictive.
A lot of things can be.

2847
02:08:10,981 --> 02:08:15,981
Psychologic foods,
can be psychologically and physically 

2848
02:08:15,981 --> 02:08:17,640
addictive work,
but one thing that they say about pot is

2849
02:08:17,700 --> 02:08:21,180
in rare individuals it can be physically
addictive,

2850
02:08:21,600 --> 02:08:26,600
but how Much so is it is physically 
addictive as sugar because sugar is one 

2851
02:08:26,600 --> 02:08:29,010
of the most addictive things that we 
consume.

2852
02:08:29,250 --> 02:08:29,740
Yeah,
no.

2853
02:08:29,790 --> 02:08:33,690
I took a just a few days off of sugaR 
and I had fucking pounding headaches.

2854
02:08:34,160 --> 02:08:34,680
Yeah.
I was like,

2855
02:08:34,681 --> 02:08:36,030
whoa.
Yeah,

2856
02:08:36,130 --> 02:08:36,850
I don't.
I don't.

2857
02:08:36,870 --> 02:08:40,170
I'm completely sUgar free now.
I don't eat anything with added sugar.

2858
02:08:40,380 --> 02:08:42,000
I don't eat it.
No processed sugar,

2859
02:08:42,001 --> 02:08:44,010
no nothing on this wacKy diet that I'm 
on,

2860
02:08:44,400 --> 02:08:49,400
but I'm.
One of the things that I found within 

2861
02:08:49,400 --> 02:08:52,011
the first few days was this overwhelming
desire to eat it and liKe I wanted 

2862
02:08:52,471 --> 02:08:53,280
candy.

2863
02:08:53,280 --> 02:08:56,070
I wanted soda.
I wanted something like within the first

2864
02:08:56,071 --> 02:08:57,690
couple of dayS,
like my body was.

2865
02:08:57,900 --> 02:09:01,080
I get headaches and I would think about 
like at see a bag of those,

2866
02:09:01,081 --> 02:09:03,870
a chili mangoes that I have back there 
that are covered in sugar,

2867
02:09:03,871 --> 02:09:07,630
like insane amounts of sugar and I just 
want them and it's,

2868
02:09:07,810 --> 02:09:11,490
it's a sugar craving.
We did you eat a ton of sugar before you

2869
02:09:11,491 --> 02:09:12,480
quit.
Not a ton,

2870
02:09:12,690 --> 02:09:17,690
but more than I should've.
And it was all in the guise of healthy 

2871
02:09:17,690 --> 02:09:17,690
things.
Like,

2872
02:09:17,690 --> 02:09:18,450
uh,
for instance,

2873
02:09:18,480 --> 02:09:21,930
I was working out with my trainer today 
and uh,

2874
02:09:21,990 --> 02:09:22,990
he had,
uh,

2875
02:09:23,910 --> 02:09:26,850
one of those protein bars and uh,
he goes,

2876
02:09:26,851 --> 02:09:27,810
uh,
I said,

2877
02:09:27,811 --> 02:09:29,580
hey,
you forgot your candy bar.

2878
02:09:29,581 --> 02:09:30,630
He goes,
it's a protein bar.

2879
02:09:31,080 --> 02:09:32,190
I go,
it's a protein bar.

2880
02:09:32,191 --> 02:09:33,450
I go,
hoW much is in that thing?

2881
02:09:33,730 --> 02:09:34,530
He goes,
not that much.

2882
02:09:34,680 --> 02:09:35,640
I go,
how much do you think?

2883
02:09:36,060 --> 02:09:37,470
He goes,
nine grams.

2884
02:09:37,471 --> 02:09:38,400
I go,
nine grams.

2885
02:09:38,401 --> 02:09:40,320
I go to bed.
I bet it's about 19 grams.

2886
02:09:40,321 --> 02:09:40,750
Like,
no,

2887
02:09:40,760 --> 02:09:41,080
no,
no,

2888
02:09:41,081 --> 02:09:41,370
no,
no.

2889
02:09:41,580 --> 02:09:42,570
And he looked at it.
He goes,

2890
02:09:42,900 --> 02:09:44,100
10 grams,
and I go,

2891
02:09:44,160 --> 02:09:45,450
really?
I go,

2892
02:09:45,451 --> 02:09:47,100
how many servings?
And he goes,

2893
02:09:47,130 --> 02:09:47,640
oh yeah,

2894
02:09:49,850 --> 02:09:52,190
those motherfuckers,
dude,

2895
02:09:52,300 --> 02:09:54,680
it was this big.
It was like it wasn't a chocolate.

2896
02:09:54,681 --> 02:09:55,900
He won,
it was chocolate.

2897
02:09:56,060 --> 02:09:57,100
Chocolate was,
yeah,

2898
02:09:57,101 --> 02:10:00,970
it was four inches.
This tiny little thing and they were,

2899
02:10:01,240 --> 02:10:05,690
they were calling it to surveil curse 
fuckers.

2900
02:10:07,130 --> 02:10:12,070
Ten grams of sugar and then you look up 
and it's to serve as the cons.

2901
02:10:12,500 --> 02:10:17,500
He had my kids eat granola,
my wife buys granola bars for the kids 

2902
02:10:17,500 --> 02:10:17,500
and it's got chocolate and I'm like,
of these are,

2903
02:10:17,500 --> 02:10:20,570
these are candy bars.
Granola bar is like,

2904
02:10:20,760 --> 02:10:22,010
you know,
nature valley.

2905
02:10:22,040 --> 02:10:22,740
Oh,
you know,

2906
02:10:22,910 --> 02:10:27,910
it's got a lot of sugar in it,
but there's no fucking chocolate at 

2907
02:10:27,910 --> 02:10:27,910
least.
RIght.

2908
02:10:27,910 --> 02:10:28,640
But even those,
if you look at the sugar content,

2909
02:10:28,670 --> 02:10:30,740
like 10,
11 grams for you always supposed to have

2910
02:10:30,800 --> 02:10:33,540
25 grams of sugar in a fucking day.
Yeah.

2911
02:10:33,590 --> 02:10:34,370
It's stunning

2912
02:10:34,370 --> 02:10:39,370
how much sugar's in everything.
There's a great documentary called that 

2913
02:10:39,370 --> 02:10:42,281
sugar movie and it just details how all 
this happened and how many things have 

2914
02:10:42,281 --> 02:10:44,600
sugar in them and added sugar and how 
bad it is for your body.

2915
02:10:44,601 --> 02:10:46,270
It's fucking unbelievable.
It's talk

2916
02:10:46,490 --> 02:10:48,720
and How much worse corn syrup is than 
shudder.

2917
02:10:48,850 --> 02:10:49,890
Yup.
I just did a,

2918
02:10:50,030 --> 02:10:52,390
uh,
a corporate event in fargo,

2919
02:10:52,391 --> 02:10:57,391
North Dakota for the beet sugar farmers 
of America and it was all these farmers 

2920
02:10:57,391 --> 02:11:01,830
mostly like family owned little farms 
around Minnesota and North Dakota and 

2921
02:11:01,830 --> 02:11:06,121
they came in and I just,
I walked down and walked on stage and I 

2922
02:11:06,121 --> 02:11:06,720
go,
fuck corn syrup and the placement.

2923
02:11:12,540 --> 02:11:15,010
Yeah,
corn syrup just goes right to your house

2924
02:11:15,110 --> 02:11:17,860
and it's all because they were over 
farming.

2925
02:11:18,120 --> 02:11:21,700
Corn is cheap to make and it's easY and 
the government was helping pay for it.

2926
02:11:21,701 --> 02:11:22,390
And I went,
well,

2927
02:11:22,391 --> 02:11:24,070
we're not going to stop.
What do we do with it?

2928
02:11:24,340 --> 02:11:25,690
Well,
we'll make fucking sugar.

2929
02:11:25,691 --> 02:11:27,370
Adam see king corn now.

2930
02:11:28,590 --> 02:11:30,480
Great documentary.
Oh yeah.

2931
02:11:30,540 --> 02:11:31,650
Oh yeah.
Amazing.

2932
02:11:31,651 --> 02:11:33,480
It starts off with these guys.
I was a project.

2933
02:11:33,481 --> 02:11:38,481
You're going to grow corn.
They're going to like get an acre of 

2934
02:11:38,481 --> 02:11:39,990
land and plowed themselves and grow corn
and they start doing all these tests and

2935
02:11:39,991 --> 02:11:44,991
find out that their Body is like some 
insane amount of the carbon fibers in 

2936
02:11:45,451 --> 02:11:47,820
their body come from corn.
And they're like,

2937
02:11:47,821 --> 02:11:49,110
what the fuck?
so they get,

2938
02:11:49,140 --> 02:11:51,060
you know,
they get their blood work done,

2939
02:11:51,061 --> 02:11:56,061
all this stuff,
they find this out and then they start 

2940
02:11:56,061 --> 02:11:57,651
going and examining all the different 
food it's in the grocery store and how 

2941
02:11:57,651 --> 02:11:58,710
much of It contains corn,
corn proteins,

2942
02:11:58,711 --> 02:12:00,810
corn syrup,
corn byproducts,

2943
02:12:01,020 --> 02:12:06,020
and then they go deep,
deep down into the rabbit hole of the 

2944
02:12:06,020 --> 02:12:06,230
subsidized corn industry and how,
how it all happened,

2945
02:12:06,270 --> 02:12:09,360
how it all get started and you leave at 
the end of that movie.

2946
02:12:09,360 --> 02:12:13,950
Like whAt in the fuck.
We've been cooptive in so many different

2947
02:12:13,951 --> 02:12:18,951
ways in this country by special interest
Groups and by people that have figured 

2948
02:12:18,951 --> 02:12:21,240
out how to generate an extract.
Massive amounts of money from particular

2949
02:12:21,241 --> 02:12:24,840
sectors that are not good for us is part
of agriculture.

2950
02:12:24,841 --> 02:12:26,790
Corn and ethanol.
Yeah.

2951
02:12:27,210 --> 02:12:28,830
Yeah.
Try to figure out how to put in your gas

2952
02:12:28,831 --> 02:12:29,730
tank.
Exactly.

2953
02:12:29,731 --> 02:12:32,340
Let's dO that.
You have fox not good for your engine,

2954
02:12:33,150 --> 02:12:33,870
ethan.
Not good,

2955
02:12:34,370 --> 02:12:36,930
not good for your end,
but alcohol is like if they could figure

2956
02:12:36,931 --> 02:12:39,960
out how to do alcohol engines,
like the rockefeller thing,

2957
02:12:40,290 --> 02:12:41,880
what's wrong with ethanol?
Was it duty engine?

2958
02:12:42,240 --> 02:12:44,500
I heard it causes some kind of backup 
over times.

2959
02:12:45,180 --> 02:12:49,420
Jack bullshit that the oil industry,
so you never knoW.

2960
02:12:49,630 --> 02:12:51,820
Do you know john?
John d rockefeller grant,

2961
02:12:51,850 --> 02:12:56,850
great,
great grandson now is a heavily into 

2962
02:12:56,850 --> 02:13:00,300
developing three d,
three d printer meat steaks that come 

2963
02:13:00,300 --> 02:13:04,600
out of a three d printer and we'll be 
using all like soy type ingredients.

2964
02:13:04,601 --> 02:13:06,850
They'd be all like,
you know in the printer,

2965
02:13:06,880 --> 02:13:10,690
doesn't rot like dry ingredients and you
will be able to.

2966
02:13:10,710 --> 02:13:11,830
They can do it now.
They can.

2967
02:13:12,130 --> 02:13:15,100
They can make steak chips through a 
three d printer.

2968
02:13:15,101 --> 02:13:20,101
They're edible And I say it's just a 
matter of time until they can make 

2969
02:13:20,101 --> 02:13:22,900
actual stakes to jesus.
I to how good that is for you.

2970
02:13:23,930 --> 02:13:28,930
Well,
it'd be probably better than some kinds 

2971
02:13:28,930 --> 02:13:28,930
of meats,
but

2972
02:13:29,150 --> 02:13:31,410
what they say it's good for third world 
countries because there'll be able to.

2973
02:13:31,411 --> 02:13:36,411
First Of all,
you won't have to have all that methane 

2974
02:13:36,411 --> 02:13:37,530
from all the downsides of having cattle.
It can get rid of that.

2975
02:13:37,531 --> 02:13:42,531
And then also you can set these things 
up in third world country and feed 

2976
02:13:42,531 --> 02:13:42,531
people.
Fucking poor people.

2977
02:13:42,531 --> 02:13:44,220
Imagine them for steak.
What you get them to do

2978
02:13:46,400 --> 02:13:51,400
out iphones,
like a motherfucker hungry order steak 

2979
02:13:51,400 --> 02:13:53,940
from the lab,
rockefeller air invest in from taking.

2980
02:13:54,130 --> 02:13:56,610
Scroll down This picture of a state 
coming out of a printer.

2981
02:13:56,611 --> 02:14:00,420
It's hilarious.
I know there's not a wrong article.

2982
02:14:01,860 --> 02:14:03,360
These guys,
do they just,

2983
02:14:03,361 --> 02:14:06,330
the rockefeller ehrs,
do they just get cash?

2984
02:14:07,050 --> 02:14:12,050
How does that work?
Do they just get money and they just 

2985
02:14:12,050 --> 02:14:12,050
start their own startup?
What is it?

2986
02:14:12,050 --> 02:14:14,460
What do you think that feels like if you
grow up like stupid rich?

2987
02:14:14,461 --> 02:14:17,160
We never have to worry about the future 
and you're like,

2988
02:14:17,161 --> 02:14:19,380
ah,
maybe I'll make a startup.

2989
02:14:20,780 --> 02:14:23,810
That's what it should be.
That's the correct use of that money.

2990
02:14:23,811 --> 02:14:24,470
I mean,
if you're gonna,

2991
02:14:24,680 --> 02:14:28,940
if you're going to get rid of the death 
tax or call it really what it is,

2992
02:14:28,941 --> 02:14:31,640
these state tax,
at least these people like,

2993
02:14:31,641 --> 02:14:36,641
you know,
the kennedys or are doing stuff in the 

2994
02:14:36,641 --> 02:14:36,641
rockefellers.
You're doing sTuff where they're,

2995
02:14:36,641 --> 02:14:36,641
you know,
they're saying,

2996
02:14:36,641 --> 02:14:37,850
all right,
without economic pressure,

2997
02:14:38,030 --> 02:14:39,680
let me explore and do something a little
on the,

2998
02:14:39,681 --> 02:14:41,980
on the fringes that might work.
And you know,

2999
02:14:42,050 --> 02:14:42,920
whether it's,
uh,

3000
02:14:43,250 --> 02:14:45,380
you know,
non fossil energy or whatever.

3001
02:14:45,440 --> 02:14:46,650
And uh,
So it's,

3002
02:14:46,690 --> 02:14:47,630
it's pretty cool.

3003
02:14:48,220 --> 02:14:50,740
Yeah,
it's nice if you see someone who's given

3004
02:14:50,741 --> 02:14:55,150
this unusual roll the dice,
some wonderful hand of cards,

3005
02:14:55,540 --> 02:15:00,110
nice.
They use it in a totally egalitarian way

3006
02:15:00,111 --> 02:15:05,111
and some,
some beautiful way where they just 

3007
02:15:05,111 --> 02:15:07,740
decided to donate it or figure out a way
to help or put money into something 

3008
02:15:07,740 --> 02:15:08,860
that's going to benefit people.

3009
02:15:09,400 --> 02:15:11,710
Start a foundation that's just,
you know,

3010
02:15:11,711 --> 02:15:16,711
trying to create peace,
which sounds so erudite and 

3011
02:15:16,711 --> 02:15:16,750
unattainable,
but to go like,

3012
02:15:17,020 --> 02:15:18,400
no,
I'm going to work on peace.

3013
02:15:18,490 --> 02:15:19,930
Just the concept of peace.

3014
02:15:20,210 --> 02:15:21,830
It's just rare.
Yeah.

3015
02:15:22,010 --> 02:15:26,270
It's rare that someone just looks at it 
and says,

3016
02:15:26,271 --> 02:15:26,960
well,
hey,

3017
02:15:27,020 --> 02:15:30,740
I have this opportunity to do somethinG 
really beneficial for the human race.

3018
02:15:31,010 --> 02:15:36,010
Let's take this $100,000,000
that I was born with and put it to use 

3019
02:15:36,230 --> 02:15:38,090
lIquid robert kennedy's down for the 
environment.

3020
02:15:38,091 --> 02:15:38,540
I mean,
he,

3021
02:15:38,750 --> 02:15:42,650
he's responsible for getting all the 
pcbs out of the hudson river and,

3022
02:15:42,660 --> 02:15:45,890
uh,
working on making safer a nuclear power.

3023
02:15:46,310 --> 02:15:48,440
WhAt do they do to get pcbs out of the 
river?

3024
02:15:48,441 --> 02:15:50,050
What I mean,
how the fuck do they clean the room

3025
02:15:50,400 --> 02:15:55,400
dredge.
They get to go in there and fucking zen 

3026
02:15:55,400 --> 02:15:58,220
it out.
Some people argue as bad because it 

3027
02:15:58,220 --> 02:15:58,410
stirs it up.
It will put is in,

3028
02:15:58,830 --> 02:16:00,450
you know,
in layers embedded in the,

3029
02:16:00,590 --> 02:16:05,100
in the bed of the river.
But they say,

3030
02:16:05,101 --> 02:16:10,101
well if a,
if a hurricane or tornado or whatever 

3031
02:16:10,101 --> 02:16:10,101
comes,
it's gonna.

3032
02:16:10,101 --> 02:16:13,220
It's going to bring it up in a much more
destructive way so it's better to bring 

3033
02:16:13,220 --> 02:16:13,220
it up.

3034
02:16:13,220 --> 02:16:16,590
So they bring it up from.
What are they doing when they bring it 

3035
02:16:16,590 --> 02:16:16,590
up there?
They're cleaning it.

3036
02:16:16,590 --> 02:16:16,590
So I guess they,

3037
02:16:16,590 --> 02:16:18,920
they filter it,
dump it somewhere.

3038
02:16:19,100 --> 02:16:23,610
Huh?
But then he Also just a close up,

3039
02:16:23,611 --> 02:16:25,440
there was a,
there was the gm plant,

3040
02:16:25,441 --> 02:16:30,441
there was a bunch of plants on the 
hudson river that we're dumping raw 

3041
02:16:30,441 --> 02:16:30,441
sewage in and he stopped.
All of those

3042
02:16:30,590 --> 02:16:32,500
are crazy now.
That's wherever you can swim in it.

3043
02:16:32,710 --> 02:16:34,240
Watts.
I grew up on the huDson river.

3044
02:16:34,241 --> 02:16:37,270
We swim in it and we were told not to.
We were fine,

3045
02:16:37,271 --> 02:16:42,271
but now they say,
but now they have like little beaches 

3046
02:16:42,271 --> 02:16:42,271
setup on the hudson rIver.
Upstate's.

3047
02:16:42,271 --> 02:16:42,370
Yeah.
Even in the city,

3048
02:16:42,371 --> 02:16:45,680
you can take a fucking kayak out on the 
west side and you can swim in it,

3049
02:16:45,910 --> 02:16:47,710
swim in it.
That sounds weird.

3050
02:16:47,960 --> 02:16:49,900
It gets in your mouth.
Then you die.

3051
02:16:50,770 --> 02:16:51,910
Get acute.
Your math class.

3052
02:16:52,830 --> 02:16:54,330
Stupid.
No,

3053
02:16:54,370 --> 02:16:57,400
they used to bars used to pull lobsters 
out of the river.

3054
02:16:58,030 --> 02:16:59,950
They used to be bar food.
Yeah.

3055
02:16:59,980 --> 02:17:03,010
It was like.
It was thought to be a poor man's meal.

3056
02:17:03,070 --> 02:17:04,210
Well,
in Ireland it was.

3057
02:17:04,211 --> 02:17:09,211
Yeah,
but even in America he and in the early 

3058
02:17:09,211 --> 02:17:11,880
days of New York city,
they used to just set out lobster traps 

3059
02:17:11,880 --> 02:17:14,790
and when someone will order a lobster,
they would just go pull a trap out and 

3060
02:17:14,790 --> 02:17:15,550
grab one of the lobsters and cook it.

3061
02:17:15,580 --> 02:17:20,580
Now she was thought to be a poor food.
Poor people during the famine in 

3062
02:17:20,580 --> 02:17:22,660
Ireland.
They were exporting lobster was.

3063
02:17:22,661 --> 02:17:24,700
They would need it.
They thought it was like a rat.

3064
02:17:25,390 --> 02:17:27,730
Oh my god.
Fucking stupid.

3065
02:17:27,731 --> 02:17:30,100
Irish.
Stupid.

3066
02:17:30,940 --> 02:17:34,300
He fucking data's sitting lobster,
but we don't have any black.

3067
02:17:34,301 --> 02:17:37,780
We don't have any butter anyway.
Maybe that's what it is.

3068
02:17:37,781 --> 02:17:39,110
I didn't know about butter.
Yeah.

3069
02:17:39,160 --> 02:17:44,160
Once you know about butter and lobster,
if someone puts a hold on before you 

3070
02:17:44,160 --> 02:17:44,160
ship those out,
just try this.

3071
02:17:44,160 --> 02:17:45,610
Yeah.
You fucking idiots with this bib on.

3072
02:17:45,760 --> 02:17:50,760
You've got to have to bid.
I saw on instagram this guy cooked a 

3073
02:17:50,760 --> 02:17:53,881
coyote.
He cooked a coyote and barbecued it 

3074
02:17:53,881 --> 02:17:54,580
barbecue and had barbecue sauce and 
brought it to work.

3075
02:17:54,581 --> 02:17:59,170
Pulled coyote and apparently so it was 
delicious and people were loving it.

3076
02:17:59,260 --> 02:18:00,100
Yeah.
Yeah.

3077
02:18:00,580 --> 02:18:01,930
There's a lot of shit you can eat.

3078
02:18:02,300 --> 02:18:03,270
Yeah.
I mean,

3079
02:18:03,271 --> 02:18:06,050
I wouldn't think to eat a coyote.
I saw an episode of mediator,

3080
02:18:06,051 --> 02:18:09,970
steve rinella and remy warrant and they 
shot a coyote and cooked it over an open

3081
02:18:09,971 --> 02:18:11,160
fire and ate it.
Yeah.

3082
02:18:11,260 --> 02:18:12,670
Because they want to see what it tasted 
like.

3083
02:18:13,180 --> 02:18:18,180
There's some good shit if you go to this
restaurant called typhoon and santa 

3084
02:18:18,180 --> 02:18:21,360
monica and they've got a,
you can eat scorpions and uh,

3085
02:18:21,710 --> 02:18:24,290
all shit that would die in a typhoon 
right.

3086
02:18:24,370 --> 02:18:29,370
Should they might find on the side of 
the beach if you want to play out the 

3087
02:18:29,370 --> 02:18:31,190
post apocalypse,
come to typhoon tuesday night.

3088
02:18:31,191 --> 02:18:33,160
Special jelly fish.
Wow.

3089
02:18:33,161 --> 02:18:34,930
Scorpions,
scorpions.

3090
02:18:34,931 --> 02:18:36,160
Did you try it?
Oh fuck.

3091
02:18:36,190 --> 02:18:38,000
Yeah.
Just crunchy,

3092
02:18:38,220 --> 02:18:39,520
you know,
a little salty.

3093
02:18:39,820 --> 02:18:40,810
Nice.
Well,

3094
02:18:40,811 --> 02:18:42,070
they must have added salt,
right?

3095
02:18:42,130 --> 02:18:43,720
It's all good protein.
Yeah.

3096
02:18:43,870 --> 02:18:48,870
Well they say that bug protein is really
good for you and in a lot of ways I 

3097
02:18:48,870 --> 02:18:50,710
think that that's gonna be the future of
protein for the world.

3098
02:18:50,710 --> 02:18:55,710
Like they have bugged bars and are made 
out of like grasshoppers and things 

3099
02:18:55,710 --> 02:18:56,560
along those lines and um,
it's very healthy,

3100
02:18:56,950 --> 02:19:01,810
full amino acid profile and a lot of 
people who are maybe vegetarian or vegan

3101
02:19:01,811 --> 02:19:06,811
and have a real problem with eating 
animals do not have a problem with 

3102
02:19:06,811 --> 02:19:06,811
eating insects.
They're like,

3103
02:19:06,811 --> 02:19:07,630
well,
wait a bug.

3104
02:19:08,020 --> 02:19:09,880
Yeah.
I have a friend who's vegan.

3105
02:19:09,881 --> 02:19:14,881
He'll fucking slap the shit out of 
mosquito on them and kill it and drop it

3106
02:19:15,011 --> 02:19:18,490
onto the ground.
Look at the sIngapore style scorpions.

3107
02:19:18,520 --> 02:19:19,380
Is that the,
uh,

3108
02:19:19,381 --> 02:19:24,381
the menu at that place?
Many taiwanese crickets stir fried raw 

3109
02:19:24,461 --> 02:19:25,150
garlic,
chili,

3110
02:19:25,151 --> 02:19:27,200
pepper and asian bazell.
11 bucks.

3111
02:19:27,230 --> 02:19:28,130
Oh,
iT's great.

3112
02:19:28,220 --> 02:19:29,820
It's great.
We should eat there.

3113
02:19:29,821 --> 02:19:31,250
And one night with the wife.
I'm down.

3114
02:19:31,280 --> 02:19:36,280
Let's do it.
Are actually my wife fucking Slap me if 

3115
02:19:36,280 --> 02:19:36,280
I asked her to eat a bug.

3116
02:19:36,280 --> 02:19:37,480
Well they got normal shitty.
They also have pretty good sushi bar,

3117
02:19:39,250 --> 02:19:39,970
but yeah,
I'll eat.

3118
02:19:40,000 --> 02:19:41,980
I'll eat anything.
I mean I've been down in Florida.

3119
02:19:41,981 --> 02:19:45,680
I've eaten alligator.
Alligator is really good for alligators.

3120
02:19:45,700 --> 02:19:46,300
Good.
Yeah,

3121
02:19:46,760 --> 02:19:51,760
mean apparently an alligator.
It's supposed to be insanely high in 

3122
02:19:51,760 --> 02:19:52,240
protein and very,
very low in cholesterol.

3123
02:19:52,300 --> 02:19:53,020
Yeah.
Yeah.

3124
02:19:53,021 --> 02:19:58,021
It's one of the lower thing.
It's like right up there with elk and 

3125
02:19:58,021 --> 02:20:00,130
moose are apparently the lowest in 
cholesterol and lower than chicken.

3126
02:20:00,530 --> 02:20:05,530
Yeah.
Tough to cook them though because 

3127
02:20:05,530 --> 02:20:06,060
there's so little fat.
So you gotta really nail it now.

3128
02:20:06,100 --> 02:20:06,940
Yeah.
You just got to learn.

3129
02:20:06,970 --> 02:20:11,970
it's just different.
It's different than I got some in the 

3130
02:20:11,970 --> 02:20:11,970
back.
You want some.

3131
02:20:11,970 --> 02:20:11,970
I want some help.
Yeah.

3132
02:20:11,970 --> 02:20:12,670
Yeah.
Take it home.

3133
02:20:12,820 --> 02:20:14,920
All right.
It's better.

3134
02:20:15,010 --> 02:20:20,010
Way better for you.
Higher in protein and there's zero 

3135
02:20:20,010 --> 02:20:20,010
bullshit in it.
Yeah.

3136
02:20:20,010 --> 02:20:21,700
No antibiotics,
no hormones,

3137
02:20:21,701 --> 02:20:23,320
no nothing.
Wild game.

3138
02:20:23,680 --> 02:20:26,440
And like I said,
lower cholesterol than a chicken breast.

3139
02:20:27,050 --> 02:20:29,930
I was in South Africa and we ate at a 
game farm,

3140
02:20:30,200 --> 02:20:31,400
a game park,
you know,

3141
02:20:31,401 --> 02:20:34,190
that they have to thin out the herd,
different animals.

3142
02:20:34,191 --> 02:20:36,900
And so they,
there's a restaurant called carnivore,

3143
02:20:36,960 --> 02:20:40,940
write it right in the park and they come
around with skewers and they ask you,

3144
02:20:41,270 --> 02:20:42,910
do you want some,
uh,

3145
02:20:42,920 --> 02:20:47,920
you know,
a giraffe and sharon will give you a 

3146
02:20:47,920 --> 02:20:47,920
couple of cubes.
Giraffe.

3147
02:20:47,920 --> 02:20:52,810
It was like when you took me to that 
brazilian restaurant in vegas to haas 

3148
02:20:52,810 --> 02:20:52,810
Korea.
Yeah.

3149
02:20:52,810 --> 02:20:56,710
And they were,
they came over with the skewers and 

3150
02:20:56,710 --> 02:20:56,710
they,
it was like that,

3151
02:20:56,710 --> 02:20:56,870
but it was like elephant fucking,
you know,

3152
02:20:56,871 --> 02:20:59,390
different,
different kinds of gazelles and shit.

3153
02:20:59,900 --> 02:21:02,510
TheY all had to do retail.
I did eat elephant.

3154
02:21:02,650 --> 02:21:03,710
Good.
IT was great.

3155
02:21:03,711 --> 02:21:07,490
It was a little gamey.
It had a little smell to it.

3156
02:21:07,491 --> 02:21:09,790
People right now are screaming,
screaming,

3157
02:21:09,810 --> 02:21:14,250
you fucking you to kill it.
These are all animals that were done.

3158
02:21:16,500 --> 02:21:18,340
They should've saved.
Saved.

3159
02:21:20,120 --> 02:21:24,060
Hylo is family will always remember.
What about yogi?

3160
02:21:24,090 --> 02:21:27,300
Don't eat the jody yogi bear.

3161
02:21:27,730 --> 02:21:30,520
What's yogi eat his fucking child on the
internet.

3162
02:21:32,920 --> 02:21:37,920
Jesus bears.
Bears are some people who have a weird 

3163
02:21:37,920 --> 02:21:37,920
connection with bears.
yeah.

3164
02:21:37,920 --> 02:21:42,810
They get a,
they get real upset if you kill a bear 

3165
02:21:42,810 --> 02:21:42,810
stuffed bears,
you know,

3166
02:21:42,810 --> 02:21:45,150
the most vicious animal out there that 
teddy bear to bed.

3167
02:21:45,400 --> 02:21:45,720
Well,
it's,

3168
02:21:45,810 --> 02:21:49,480
it's almost like we're trying to make 
them less dangerous.

3169
02:21:49,510 --> 02:21:51,010
Yeah.
I can make them cuddLy.

3170
02:21:51,011 --> 02:21:55,480
Like polar bears are perhaps the most 
vicious mammal on earth.

3171
02:21:55,840 --> 02:21:57,520
They are fucking monsters.
This guy,

3172
02:21:57,521 --> 02:21:59,250
Kevin Fitzgerald,
he's a veterinarian.

3173
02:21:59,260 --> 02:22:01,600
Kevin,
you know kevin and denver and he,

3174
02:22:01,610 --> 02:22:03,970
um,
we worked together once in denver and he

3175
02:22:03,971 --> 02:22:08,971
said that polar bears,
like when you have them as babies right 

3176
02:22:08,971 --> 02:22:10,270
out of the womb,
they'll try to bite you.

3177
02:22:11,350 --> 02:22:14,050
He goes there like the alien,
the alien chest,

3178
02:22:14,051 --> 02:22:14,710
burster.
He goes,

3179
02:22:14,711 --> 02:22:16,410
that's what they're like right out of 
that.

3180
02:22:16,720 --> 02:22:17,680
And I was like,
wow,

3181
02:22:17,681 --> 02:22:18,550
that is nuts.
He goes,

3182
02:22:18,551 --> 02:22:20,800
if they're hungry,
they will try to fucking eat you.

3183
02:22:20,830 --> 02:22:21,460
Yeah.
I'm like,

3184
02:22:21,461 --> 02:22:23,130
oh my god.
Damn.

3185
02:22:23,170 --> 02:22:26,250
Like people have this idea of them as 
being this like fluffy creature.

3186
02:22:26,430 --> 02:22:31,430
It's like most people live in cities and
most people will comment on animals or 

3187
02:22:31,430 --> 02:22:33,960
animal rights activists and an animal 
rights advocates.

3188
02:22:33,961 --> 02:22:38,961
These people have these ideas about the 
beautiful nature that we live around 

3189
02:22:39,060 --> 02:22:44,060
there.
They don't go out in it and you go out 

3190
02:22:44,060 --> 02:22:44,060
in it.
You really.

3191
02:22:44,060 --> 02:22:45,260
It becomes a different thing and you 
realize like,

3192
02:22:45,270 --> 02:22:46,710
wow,
there's a strange,

3193
02:22:46,910 --> 02:22:50,550
like constant conflict going on in this 
world.

3194
02:22:50,850 --> 02:22:53,250
There's very little harmony.
In fact,

3195
02:22:53,251 --> 02:22:55,950
the harmony exist with beings eating 
beans.

3196
02:22:56,010 --> 02:22:58,710
That's when the harmony exists.
It's all things.

3197
02:22:58,711 --> 02:23:01,170
Eating things and things.
Looking out for things that are about to

3198
02:23:01,171 --> 02:23:03,570
eat them.
I mean there's a reason why dear perk up

3199
02:23:03,571 --> 02:23:08,571
and they move their ears and their head 
side to side because somethIng's common 

3200
02:23:08,571 --> 02:23:12,680
always.
There's always something common and 

3201
02:23:12,680 --> 02:23:12,680
that's why they run so fast to try to 
get away from something.

3202
02:23:12,680 --> 02:23:12,690
Eating them.

3203
02:23:13,020 --> 02:23:16,410
They're not chasing anything.
Deer run fast because they don't want to

3204
02:23:16,411 --> 02:23:18,660
get eaten,
which is fucked.

3205
02:23:18,840 --> 02:23:20,700
I saw a rattlesnake.
He to squirrel.

3206
02:23:21,270 --> 02:23:22,400
Oh shit.
Saturday,

3207
02:23:22,410 --> 02:23:25,190
last summer,
and so I get the squirrel.

3208
02:23:25,260 --> 02:23:26,640
I saw him.
He already had the squirrel,

3209
02:23:26,641 --> 02:23:31,641
but I saw him take the squirrel into 
inside of him and he sought move a 

3210
02:23:31,641 --> 02:23:34,500
little bit down his body and then a and 
everybody got close to them because they

3211
02:23:34,501 --> 02:23:37,110
figured just ate right now.
So he was less.

3212
02:23:37,320 --> 02:23:38,790
It was a little more lethargic.
Yeah,

3213
02:23:38,791 --> 02:23:41,180
you can do that.
And I crawled off as bad.

3214
02:23:41,181 --> 02:23:44,280
I'd never seen a rattlesnake before,
nevermind a fuckIng eating a squirrel.

3215
02:23:44,370 --> 02:23:48,930
I was running the hills with my dogs and
I ran over what I thought was a log,

3216
02:23:49,170 --> 02:23:51,330
like a stick,
like a large stick.

3217
02:23:51,560 --> 02:23:55,470
And as I was in the air over it or 
realize it was a rattlesnake the size of

3218
02:23:55,471 --> 02:23:57,300
my forearm,
no shit.

3219
02:23:57,650 --> 02:23:59,820
I was like,
oh fuck.

3220
02:24:00,480 --> 02:24:05,480
And I had to keep my dogs back.
Once I realized that it was a 

3221
02:24:05,480 --> 02:24:07,260
rattlesnake because my dogs have been 
bitten several times,

3222
02:24:07,710 --> 02:24:08,560
die.
Rattlesnakes.

3223
02:24:08,900 --> 02:24:10,620
Uh,
my doc frank,

3224
02:24:10,621 --> 02:24:13,290
he got bitten twice and my dog,
lucy,

3225
02:24:13,291 --> 02:24:17,220
she got bitten once and their face 
swells up and it's,

3226
02:24:17,320 --> 02:24:18,930
it's bad,
it's bad.

3227
02:24:18,931 --> 02:24:23,931
But they'll go and attack the rattle 
snake even though they know they'll get 

3228
02:24:23,931 --> 02:24:23,931
bit.
Well,

3229
02:24:23,931 --> 02:24:24,570
they'll bark and they get near it and 
they bark,

3230
02:24:24,571 --> 02:24:25,320
bark,
bark,

3231
02:24:25,350 --> 02:24:30,350
bark,
and then the snakes bite them in the 

3232
02:24:30,350 --> 02:24:30,350
face.
Yeah.

3233
02:24:30,350 --> 02:24:30,350
Wow.
They don't know what it is.

3234
02:24:30,350 --> 02:24:34,701
They just know it's dangerous.
like something in their doggy brain is 

3235
02:24:34,701 --> 02:24:34,701
like,
this ain't cool.

3236
02:24:34,701 --> 02:24:37,170
Like what the fuck is this thing?
And they bark at it.

3237
02:24:37,230 --> 02:24:42,230
Whereas they don't bark at squirrels.
If they see a squirrel that chase after 

3238
02:24:42,230 --> 02:24:42,230
it and try to kill it.

3239
02:24:42,230 --> 02:24:43,200
Yeah.
But if they see a rattlesnake,

3240
02:24:43,230 --> 02:24:45,690
they uh,
they get close and I don't know,

3241
02:24:45,810 --> 02:24:48,090
I wasn't there when it actually went 
down.

3242
02:24:48,270 --> 02:24:50,160
I was there in the aftermath.
I saw the snake,

3243
02:24:50,161 --> 02:24:52,020
I pulled him away.
I looked at him,

3244
02:24:52,021 --> 02:24:53,820
I looked at his face and I'm like,
what's going on?

3245
02:24:53,821 --> 02:24:54,900
I saw a little holes.
I'm like,

3246
02:24:54,920 --> 02:24:56,010
goddammit.
He got bit.

3247
02:24:56,450 --> 02:24:59,910
So I had to take him in.
And one time I took him to the guide.

3248
02:24:59,911 --> 02:25:01,750
If you hadn't taken them in,
uh,

3249
02:25:01,800 --> 02:25:04,080
probably.
Probably eventually.

3250
02:25:04,200 --> 02:25:05,220
Yeah,
it takes awhile.

3251
02:25:05,250 --> 02:25:10,250
But they swell up like crazy.
Like the side of their face becomes a 

3252
02:25:10,250 --> 02:25:12,900
cartoonish where they got stung.
Especially a young rattlesnake.

3253
02:25:12,930 --> 02:25:17,930
Young rattlesnakes are the most 
dangerous because they don't know any 

3254
02:25:17,930 --> 02:25:20,211
better.
They empty out all their venom in one 

3255
02:25:20,211 --> 02:25:22,041
shot.
The old rattlesnakes just give you a 

3256
02:25:22,041 --> 02:25:22,041
little taste.
It's like take that motherfucker,

3257
02:25:22,050 --> 02:25:23,550
but they keep some for the kids.

3258
02:25:23,590 --> 02:25:26,020
Have that bite you again or buy 
something else an hour later.

3259
02:25:26,640 --> 02:25:31,640
Um,
but one time frank got bit and I looked 

3260
02:25:31,640 --> 02:25:31,690
at,
um,

3261
02:25:31,870 --> 02:25:33,040
and um,
I,

3262
02:25:33,130 --> 02:25:33,890
um,
I,

3263
02:25:34,140 --> 02:25:36,760
I killed a rattlesnake and then I looked
at him.

3264
02:25:36,830 --> 02:25:38,950
I go kill it.
Uh,

3265
02:25:39,010 --> 02:25:42,220
I think I used to rake forget what to 
killed it with.

3266
02:25:43,210 --> 02:25:45,710
I just killed it.
Um,

3267
02:25:45,880 --> 02:25:50,880
but um,
then I looked at frank and people are 

3268
02:25:50,880 --> 02:25:50,880
like,
why would you do that?

3269
02:25:50,880 --> 02:25:51,760
Because it's in my yard.
Sorry.

3270
02:25:51,761 --> 02:25:54,640
See that fence you get inside that 
you're dead.

3271
02:25:55,420 --> 02:25:57,190
If you can kill me,
you're dead.

3272
02:25:57,191 --> 02:25:59,350
You fucked up.
I kill you in my house.

3273
02:25:59,770 --> 02:26:01,980
I'll kill you in my yard,
my yard.

3274
02:26:01,981 --> 02:26:04,060
And you're dead.
You're dead.

3275
02:26:04,061 --> 02:26:07,300
CoyoTes dead.
If I'm practicing archery in my yard and

3276
02:26:07,301 --> 02:26:08,710
I see a coyote,
yes,

3277
02:26:08,711 --> 02:26:11,060
I'm shooting that thing.
Joe rogan was killed up,

3278
02:26:11,070 --> 02:26:14,030
sat in my apartment for me.
That's right.

3279
02:26:14,031 --> 02:26:18,370
I did with a tennis racket.
That's right.

3280
02:26:21,460 --> 02:26:24,190
Without even thinking about it.
Then sat down and watched tv.

3281
02:26:24,400 --> 02:26:26,350
Five seconds later I ran after that 
thing.

3282
02:26:26,400 --> 02:26:27,410
Yeah.
Yeah.

3283
02:26:27,620 --> 02:26:31,360
It's disturbing to switch.
Then what happened with frank?

3284
02:26:31,560 --> 02:26:31,930
Oh.
Anyway,

3285
02:26:32,050 --> 02:26:35,640
so I brought him to the vet and the vet 
looks at him and this is like,

3286
02:26:35,641 --> 02:26:38,110
uh,
after like the first time frank and lucy

3287
02:26:38,111 --> 02:26:42,190
both got bit and then this is like a 
maybe a year later,

3288
02:26:42,790 --> 02:26:47,790
um,
I wasn't sure if he got bit because I 

3289
02:26:47,790 --> 02:26:49,681
saw the rattlesnake and I saw him.
I killed a rattlesnake and then I'm 

3290
02:26:49,681 --> 02:26:49,681
like,
come here buddy,

3291
02:26:49,681 --> 02:26:52,981
let me check your face out.
And I'm looking at him and I don't see 

3292
02:26:52,981 --> 02:26:52,981
any marks.
And I'm like,

3293
02:26:52,981 --> 02:26:52,981
wow,
you seem all right,

3294
02:26:52,981 --> 02:26:54,520
but fuck,
I don't know.

3295
02:26:54,610 --> 02:26:55,300
Come on,
let's go.

3296
02:26:55,450 --> 02:26:57,650
And I'd take him in the back of the 
truck and I drag 'em,

3297
02:26:57,900 --> 02:27:00,100
take them down to the vet and the vet 
checks them out and he goes,

3298
02:27:00,130 --> 02:27:02,560
oh,
I don't see any swelling.

3299
02:27:02,590 --> 02:27:04,330
Everything seems fine.
I'm like,

3300
02:27:04,331 --> 02:27:05,590
all right.
And then I'd take them back home.

3301
02:27:05,591 --> 02:27:08,380
This face started swelling,
delayed reaction.

3302
02:27:08,381 --> 02:27:11,890
I think maybe he got like a small dose,
like it wasn't a lot,

3303
02:27:11,891 --> 02:27:16,891
but within an hour he was like,
it's hard to tell because it's 

3304
02:27:16,891 --> 02:27:17,460
adrenaline is so fired up,
you know?

3305
02:27:17,470 --> 02:27:22,470
His tongue was as a and he was like so 
excited to get to get in the car and go 

3306
02:27:23,381 --> 02:27:24,330
drive around.
Yeah.

3307
02:27:24,400 --> 02:27:27,760
He seemed normal,
but then an hour or so later after I got

3308
02:27:27,761 --> 02:27:32,761
him home,
his face started swelling so I had to 

3309
02:27:32,761 --> 02:27:32,761
bring them back in.
You got to give him the antivenom.

3310
02:27:32,761 --> 02:27:35,380
It's fucking expensive.
It's thousands of dollars.

3311
02:27:35,440 --> 02:27:37,950
So if you're shit,
it's no joke.

3312
02:27:37,951 --> 02:27:39,880
So if you're broke and your dog gets 
bit,

3313
02:27:39,881 --> 02:27:42,580
it's a fucker man.
You suck it out yourself.

3314
02:27:43,810 --> 02:27:46,030
That's a myth too.
The only Way you could suck it out as if

3315
02:27:46,031 --> 02:27:47,860
you get it right when it's happened.

3316
02:27:47,920 --> 02:27:50,110
like right.
like if it bites you right there,

3317
02:27:50,290 --> 02:27:52,660
you'd make a tourniquet.
You goT to cut yourself too.

3318
02:27:52,661 --> 02:27:54,190
You gotta.
You can't be shy about it.

3319
02:27:54,330 --> 02:27:59,330
You got to cut into with that area,
with that fucking snake is squeeze it 

3320
02:27:59,330 --> 02:28:01,300
and suck it out and you're probably not 
going to get it all.

3321
02:28:01,370 --> 02:28:06,370
You're going to get some of it,
but if you ever seen what happens to a 

3322
02:28:06,370 --> 02:28:06,370
person when they get bit by a 
rattlesnake,

3323
02:28:06,580 --> 02:28:08,530
oh my god,
we are so weak.

3324
02:28:08,820 --> 02:28:13,450
Where such we're water bags when we just
a little bags of water.

3325
02:28:13,680 --> 02:28:16,120
We're just so we're.
We're allergic to everything.

3326
02:28:16,340 --> 02:28:21,340
He this guy put a website up that 
documents him getting bit

3327
02:28:22,010 --> 02:28:27,010
by a rattlesnake like after he got bit 
hit him seeking treatment than the neck 

3328
02:28:27,820 --> 02:28:30,350
grow.
Necropsy,

3329
02:28:30,351 --> 02:28:32,360
what would you call it?
What is it called?

3330
02:28:32,690 --> 02:28:33,980
Necrosis.
Necrosis.

3331
02:28:34,490 --> 02:28:39,490
Necrosis.
When skins dying and the tissues dying 

3332
02:28:39,490 --> 02:28:42,850
all around the wound and he had to get a
skin transplants and all this crazy shit

3333
02:28:42,891 --> 02:28:47,150
and it took a long time and he 
documented the entire procedure.

3334
02:28:47,151 --> 02:28:50,930
This is one guy like,
oh wow.

3335
02:28:51,200 --> 02:28:52,790
No shit.
Ton.

3336
02:28:53,180 --> 02:28:56,130
Texas country star,
Kevin Fowler per pulse.

3337
02:28:56,170 --> 02:29:00,530
gnarly rattlesnake picture.
This guy has his hand.

3338
02:29:00,590 --> 02:29:02,330
Looks like.
I mean,

3339
02:29:02,331 --> 02:29:05,120
it looks like he has a globe in his 
hand,

3340
02:29:05,870 --> 02:29:10,160
like his hand is swollen and black so 
far,

3341
02:29:10,910 --> 02:29:15,910
so far.
Swollen forearm a little further.

3342
02:29:17,130 --> 02:29:20,960
I think that's the one.
Go to that website visit page.

3343
02:29:21,380 --> 02:29:22,250
Um,
this is,

3344
02:29:22,340 --> 02:29:27,340
this is the verY,
this is the very website where it 

3345
02:29:27,340 --> 02:29:31,001
documents this guy that's,
that's actually one photo that's taken 

3346
02:29:31,001 --> 02:29:34,691
from the website,
but there's a website where it shows 

3347
02:29:34,691 --> 02:29:37,550
this is the absolute one guy got bitten 
and his skin all dyed.

3348
02:29:37,760 --> 02:29:39,680
HIs skin died.
And uh,

3349
02:29:39,710 --> 02:29:42,520
I believe it was a young kid too.
I don't think he was very young,

3350
02:29:42,560 --> 02:29:45,680
very old when this happened and just put
mesh over it.

3351
02:29:45,830 --> 02:29:50,830
Well that mesh is so that his skin a 
grows in place and then they take the 

3352
02:29:51,890 --> 02:29:55,040
graft and they try to put it over that.
But it is,

3353
02:29:55,550 --> 02:29:56,630
it's rough,
man.

3354
02:29:56,960 --> 02:29:57,710
It's,
um,

3355
02:29:58,040 --> 02:30:00,170
it's very,
very fucking dangerous.

3356
02:30:01,390 --> 02:30:03,350
You gotta write rattlesnake.
You can't just write,

3357
02:30:04,130 --> 02:30:06,370
but anyway,
I'm not.

3358
02:30:06,530 --> 02:30:11,530
No bueno.
I was up on that same trip to South 

3359
02:30:11,530 --> 02:30:11,530
Africa.
My,

3360
02:30:11,530 --> 02:30:15,590
my daughter was probably about three and
then we went down to the uh,

3361
02:30:16,040 --> 02:30:17,120
in,
in cape town.

3362
02:30:17,121 --> 02:30:22,121
There's the cape of good hope is that 
the little thing that sticks out there 

3363
02:30:22,121 --> 02:30:26,370
haven't been,
and you can hike through this field and 

3364
02:30:26,370 --> 02:30:29,201
get to the,
it is like the southwestern tip of 

3365
02:30:29,201 --> 02:30:31,691
europe and africa and so we go down 
there and we get out of the car and 

3366
02:30:31,691 --> 02:30:36,431
there's all these baboons and they're 
fucking vicious and they're aggressive 

3367
02:30:36,431 --> 02:30:37,460
and the park ranger was like,
um,

3368
02:30:38,120 --> 02:30:43,120
yeah,
you may want to keep her in your arms 

3369
02:30:43,120 --> 02:30:43,120
the whole time.
AnD I was like,

3370
02:30:43,120 --> 02:30:43,220
why?
And they're like,

3371
02:30:43,221 --> 02:30:44,860
well,
if the snakes don't get it,

3372
02:30:44,900 --> 02:30:46,220
bad wounds,
just going to grab her.

3373
02:30:48,650 --> 02:30:53,650
I just watching your daughter get taken 
by a fucking bad balloon and eaton or 

3374
02:30:53,650 --> 02:30:57,050
taken by a fucking giant bella chimps.
Chimps take babies.

3375
02:30:57,110 --> 02:30:58,160
Yeah.
Yeah.

3376
02:30:58,940 --> 02:31:03,940
Fuck.
That would be close to up there with 

3377
02:31:03,940 --> 02:31:04,940
your worst nightmare.
top three worst nightmares,

3378
02:31:05,300 --> 02:31:07,520
pat boone and taking your child is as 
they scream.

3379
02:31:07,850 --> 02:31:12,850
Yeah.
Baboons might aLso might even be worse 

3380
02:31:12,850 --> 02:31:12,850
than a lion.
Yeah,

3381
02:31:12,850 --> 02:31:17,590
both would be horrific.
But there's something about a primate 

3382
02:31:17,590 --> 02:31:17,590
doing it.
Yeah.

3383
02:31:17,590 --> 02:31:18,970
That's baboons are so weird.
It's like a monkey.

3384
02:31:19,290 --> 02:31:20,600
That dog,
you know,

3385
02:31:20,830 --> 02:31:24,120
some weird sort of half,
half monkey,

3386
02:31:24,330 --> 02:31:27,990
half dog face thing.
she's so aggressive,

3387
02:31:28,020 --> 02:31:32,910
so aggressive and their hands are just a
long arms and strong hands come right at

3388
02:31:32,911 --> 02:31:34,530
you.
Creepy fox.

3389
02:31:34,531 --> 02:31:35,930
Yeah.
shit,

3390
02:31:35,970 --> 02:31:37,840
I've never seen a documentary they did 
with um,

3391
02:31:37,890 --> 02:31:38,520
they,
they,

3392
02:31:38,760 --> 02:31:43,760
they teamed dogs like baboons,
actually tame dogs and they taught these

3393
02:31:44,551 --> 02:31:47,030
dogs had to be like,
watch dogs get.

3394
02:31:47,040 --> 02:31:47,420
Yeah,
they,

3395
02:31:47,421 --> 02:31:52,020
they took these dogs in and fed them.
Like in they had these tribes of baboons

3396
02:31:52,080 --> 02:31:55,450
and they had figured out that this up as
an experiment or just had another dog.

3397
02:31:55,470 --> 02:31:58,920
The baboons did it.
The baboons have these dogs and fed them

3398
02:31:59,220 --> 02:32:00,930
and then the dogs like stayed around 
them.

3399
02:32:00,931 --> 02:32:05,931
And when anything would come near,
the dogs would bark and the baboons 

3400
02:32:05,931 --> 02:32:05,931
would come out and no shit.
Yeah,

3401
02:32:05,970 --> 02:32:08,310
they're smart as fuck dude.
Damn.

3402
02:32:08,520 --> 02:32:10,830
They're creepy and their world is harsh 
and you know,

3403
02:32:10,860 --> 02:32:13,620
so their actions don't seem like 
intelligent actions,

3404
02:32:13,621 --> 02:32:15,680
you know,
they don't have community and it's,

3405
02:32:15,780 --> 02:32:17,030
you know,
it's not like a,

3406
02:32:17,410 --> 02:32:21,000
they have an a language and you rapid 
use of tools or anything like that.

3407
02:32:21,001 --> 02:32:24,510
But they're very intelligent and some 
sort of a weird way.

3408
02:32:24,511 --> 02:32:29,511
They figure if they figure out problems 
and then we stick them in steel cages 

3409
02:32:29,511 --> 02:32:29,520
for life.

3410
02:32:29,880 --> 02:32:31,890
There was an article that a tweeted 
today,

3411
02:32:32,160 --> 02:32:37,160
see if he could see that they believe 
that chimpanzees and monkeys have just 

3412
02:32:37,160 --> 02:32:39,930
started using stone tools over the last 
40,000

3413
02:32:39,931 --> 02:32:43,290
years and that chimps are entering the 
age,

3414
02:32:43,330 --> 02:32:46,440
the stone age.
Like there they are evolving.

3415
02:32:46,740 --> 02:32:49,680
Chimps and monkeys have entered the 
stone age in the wild.

3416
02:32:49,710 --> 02:32:50,820
Yes.
In the wild.

3417
02:32:50,970 --> 02:32:55,970
They're actually evolving and that this 
could eventually lead to chimps becoming

3418
02:32:56,851 --> 02:32:59,190
something very different than what they 
are now.

3419
02:32:59,400 --> 02:33:00,870
That what we're seeing now,
you know,

3420
02:33:00,871 --> 02:33:03,690
a million years from now,
chimps might not be chimps anymore.

3421
02:33:04,050 --> 02:33:06,270
They could become neanderthals.
It can become us.

3422
02:33:07,200 --> 02:33:09,360
We've only been us for a couple of 
hundred thousand years.

3423
02:33:09,361 --> 02:33:10,560
Yeah.
You know,

3424
02:33:10,770 --> 02:33:11,180
he,
um,

3425
02:33:11,260 --> 02:33:15,480
I'm listening to this book right now on 
tape about,

3426
02:33:15,481 --> 02:33:16,930
uh,
you know,

3427
02:33:17,000 --> 02:33:20,670
or like prehistoric man from like the 
first socialization.

3428
02:33:20,700 --> 02:33:21,120
Oh,
uh,

3429
02:33:21,220 --> 02:33:22,410
what's it called?
Sapiens.

3430
02:33:23,280 --> 02:33:25,510
Who wrote that?
Um,

3431
02:33:26,030 --> 02:33:27,600
we're at sapiens

3432
02:33:31,320 --> 02:33:34,600
do Your,
do you will yuval noah harari?

3433
02:33:35,000 --> 02:33:40,000
Well,
what a name you've brief history of 

3434
02:33:40,000 --> 02:33:41,620
humankind and just talking,
talking.

3435
02:33:41,650 --> 02:33:43,420
Yeah.
It's talkiNg about how,

3436
02:33:44,020 --> 02:33:47,070
you know,
neanderthal man and um,

3437
02:33:47,700 --> 02:33:49,830
um,
what was the one that,

3438
02:33:49,831 --> 02:33:51,190
and,
and he and homo sapiens,

3439
02:33:51,191 --> 02:33:56,191
which is what came after neanderthal 
people think there was like a timeline 

3440
02:33:56,191 --> 02:33:56,770
because when you look at timelines,
it lists one,

3441
02:33:56,920 --> 02:33:59,800
then there's a line segment and then the
next one starts.

3442
02:34:00,100 --> 02:34:05,100
But there was a time when they were both
on the earth at the same time and they 

3443
02:34:05,100 --> 02:34:06,550
were fighting and neanderthal was 
fucking way bigger.

3444
02:34:06,551 --> 02:34:09,370
a more powerful way.
Stronger and bigger brains and big.

3445
02:34:09,410 --> 02:34:10,690
Right.
Which is weird.

3446
02:34:10,750 --> 02:34:12,220
Yeah.
They don't even know why.

3447
02:34:12,221 --> 02:34:17,221
They don't know if the brain was bigger 
to control the body because they don't 

3448
02:34:17,221 --> 02:34:18,700
have one to study all the speculation of
how smart they were.

3449
02:34:18,740 --> 02:34:20,890
Yeah.
And it was a battle in the,

3450
02:34:20,891 --> 02:34:25,891
uh,
the sapiens one because they had 

3451
02:34:25,891 --> 02:34:26,560
techniques for hunter working as a group
and surrounding the other ones.

3452
02:34:26,561 --> 02:34:28,140
And they use tools.
Uh,

3453
02:34:28,220 --> 02:34:30,040
I guess,
I don't know if it was rocks or whatever

3454
02:34:30,041 --> 02:34:33,190
it is that they use,
that the neanderthals were not using.

3455
02:34:33,520 --> 02:34:36,640
I think it's they just divided them and 
fuck them all.

3456
02:34:36,810 --> 02:34:37,960
Yeah.
And became,

3457
02:34:38,050 --> 02:34:40,210
They became us.
How did they don't know?

3458
02:34:40,660 --> 02:34:42,430
That's my fear.
My,

3459
02:34:42,610 --> 02:34:45,280
they were on top.
I don't wonder man.

3460
02:34:45,281 --> 02:34:48,250
I mean they know that there was some 
interbreeding yeah.

3461
02:34:48,310 --> 02:34:53,310
or at least they believed or some 
interbreeding and they recently found 

3462
02:34:53,310 --> 02:34:57,150
some,
a bone of an ancient neanderthal that 

3463
02:34:57,150 --> 02:34:59,260
had human dna in it.
And so they're like,

3464
02:34:59,261 --> 02:35:00,190
well,
what the fuck?

3465
02:35:00,940 --> 02:35:02,320
Yeah.
See if you find that,

3466
02:35:02,321 --> 02:35:03,850
because I think I tweeted that recently 
too,

3467
02:35:03,851 --> 02:35:05,970
but just might,
I might not be human.

3468
02:35:05,971 --> 02:35:07,170
You mean sapient?
Yes.

3469
02:35:07,230 --> 02:35:12,230
Homeless in dma.
I mean because I guess neanderthal or 

3470
02:35:12,230 --> 02:35:12,940
human type of humans.
Is that what they are?

3471
02:35:13,330 --> 02:35:14,380
Uh,
yeah.

3472
02:35:14,381 --> 02:35:16,620
I guess there's homo erectus,
homo,

3473
02:35:16,630 --> 02:35:19,060
whatever.
And then homosapien is what's considered

3474
02:35:19,061 --> 02:35:21,190
modern man.
Yeah.

3475
02:35:21,191 --> 02:35:26,191
they don't necessarily hear it is humans
made with neanderthals much earlier and 

3476
02:35:26,191 --> 02:35:28,510
more frequently than thought.
This is really recently.

3477
02:35:28,540 --> 02:35:31,070
This is February 17th?
Yeah.

3478
02:35:31,190 --> 02:35:36,190
Yeah.
people will fuck a sheep will fuck 

3479
02:35:36,401 --> 02:35:41,401
anything.
I can't believe I never fucked an 

3480
02:35:41,401 --> 02:35:41,401
animal.

3481
02:35:41,401 --> 02:35:43,960
You know?
I was so horny when I was a teenager,

3482
02:35:44,320 --> 02:35:46,960
I think because we didn't have pets.
It's the only thing that stopped dog.

3483
02:35:47,210 --> 02:35:48,700
Fuck that.
I would've fucked my dog.

3484
02:35:48,730 --> 02:35:50,230
Definitely.
What?

3485
02:35:50,400 --> 02:35:55,400
Depending on the kind of.
Well also we grew up without rampant 

3486
02:35:55,630 --> 02:35:58,090
access to pornography like these kids 
have today.

3487
02:35:58,150 --> 02:36:00,220
Yeah.
Like if a kid today as an iphone,

3488
02:36:00,430 --> 02:36:03,490
you've got all the porn in the world at 
your fingertips,

3489
02:36:03,700 --> 02:36:04,690
bam.
You could watch people.

3490
02:36:04,691 --> 02:36:06,680
Fuck.
All I had was a sheep dog.

3491
02:36:06,940 --> 02:36:08,800
Vaseline.
It's hard back then.

3492
02:36:09,580 --> 02:36:10,420
Yeah,
I can.

3493
02:36:10,421 --> 02:36:10,890
Uh,
and,

3494
02:36:11,050 --> 02:36:13,030
and you know,
the final nude episode,

3495
02:36:13,031 --> 02:36:17,200
new tradition of playboys coming out.
Pam anderson will be the last nude model

3496
02:36:17,201 --> 02:36:18,670
in playboy history.
Great.

3497
02:36:19,060 --> 02:36:20,920
Someone no one Wants to see negative 
anymore.

3498
02:36:21,070 --> 02:36:23,770
Perfect cutaway to go out,
go out with a fizzle.

3499
02:36:23,830 --> 02:36:24,760
Ease us out.

3500
02:36:26,980 --> 02:36:31,980
Even if she doesn't look good.
What are you looking at is not really 

3501
02:36:31,980 --> 02:36:32,590
that person anymore.
And looking at photoshop elements,

3502
02:36:33,040 --> 02:36:35,170
you know,
you're lookIng at well hurt,

3503
02:36:35,171 --> 02:36:38,860
you mean physically that she's not her 
own parts and then they'll photoshop.

3504
02:36:38,861 --> 02:36:40,230
But on top of that,
yeah,

3505
02:36:40,290 --> 02:36:45,290
you're not looking at the real image and
you're looking at some distorted like 

3506
02:36:45,290 --> 02:36:49,860
they have you ever seen what they do?
Like they've shown like the real image 

3507
02:36:49,860 --> 02:36:51,190
versus what they do.
Here she is right there.

3508
02:36:52,900 --> 02:36:57,900
She was a beauty in her day time is a 
motherfucker off of youtube that please 

3509
02:36:59,261 --> 02:37:03,780
do that sex tape and her prime.
Amazing.

3510
02:37:03,910 --> 02:37:05,470
She was so hot.
Wait,

3511
02:37:05,471 --> 02:37:07,930
these aren't the most recent ones?
Allegedly.

3512
02:37:07,931 --> 02:37:09,730
Oh really?
This was from december?

3513
02:37:09,880 --> 02:37:11,420
Yeah.
See it's all what?

3514
02:37:11,421 --> 02:37:12,460
Weird.
Black and white.

3515
02:37:12,670 --> 02:37:17,670
But you know the old hiding behind her 
pulling skin right there.

3516
02:37:19,270 --> 02:37:22,010
She got midgets.
Fucking high powered fans.

3517
02:37:22,970 --> 02:37:24,580
Blowing her sag up.

3518
02:37:27,020 --> 02:37:29,600
She's right next to the star of heft.
I don't know man.

3519
02:37:29,601 --> 02:37:29,960
It's like.
Yeah,

3520
02:37:29,990 --> 02:37:34,990
she was smart.
She would made herself look at least a 

3521
02:37:34,990 --> 02:37:35,060
little bit old in these instead of.
She looks 19.

3522
02:37:35,210 --> 02:37:38,870
Well it's like everything's blurry in 
hazy.

3523
02:37:39,100 --> 02:37:40,970
It's like you're looking at it through 
the fog.

3524
02:37:40,971 --> 02:37:44,660
Like a spotlight in a foggy room.
Any shots of her feet?

3525
02:37:48,760 --> 02:37:51,530
just the shooting age.
Yes they do.

3526
02:37:51,800 --> 02:37:52,610
Boy,
do they.

3527
02:37:52,850 --> 02:37:53,690
Okay.
Come on.

3528
02:37:53,691 --> 02:37:55,360
She doesn't look at the hemorrhoids 
coming out of her ass.

3529
02:37:55,480 --> 02:37:58,130
That is not what she looks like.
She just doesn't.

3530
02:37:58,380 --> 02:38:00,410
I mean,
that's not accurate.

3531
02:38:00,411 --> 02:38:02,580
So stupid.
She said,

3532
02:38:03,530 --> 02:38:04,820
yeah.
She said kids,

3533
02:38:04,821 --> 02:38:07,520
but she's also 50,
you know,

3534
02:38:07,550 --> 02:38:10,580
I mean she's not a cindy crawford.
50 either.

3535
02:38:11,090 --> 02:38:14,450
Cindy crawford looks great next to her.
Recently.

3536
02:38:14,630 --> 02:38:16,670
You were bowling.
We did this thing.

3537
02:38:16,910 --> 02:38:20,570
We help out with these.
I'm a retarded kids.

3538
02:38:20,810 --> 02:38:22,460
You think you're supposed to say that?

3539
02:38:22,520 --> 02:38:23,690
Mentally.
Whatever.

3540
02:38:23,691 --> 02:38:28,691
Intellectually disabled children.
It's this group that me and my son 

3541
02:38:28,691 --> 02:38:33,131
worked with and they do a bowling thing 
to raise money for them and you bowl 

3542
02:38:33,131 --> 02:38:37,130
with the mentally challenged kids and 
she's really active with it and share it

3543
02:38:37,180 --> 02:38:42,180
out there with her kids.
Her daughter is a model now are sons a 

3544
02:38:42,180 --> 02:38:43,240
model?
And she looked fucking crate,

3545
02:38:43,550 --> 02:38:46,670
which is like 51.
She looked thIrty.

3546
02:38:47,090 --> 02:38:48,140
Yeah.
Amazing.

3547
02:38:48,170 --> 02:38:51,430
Once you hit a good 30 to not like some 
thirties,

3548
02:38:51,890 --> 02:38:54,830
you know?
I knew a girl when she was 19 and then I

3549
02:38:54,831 --> 02:38:57,980
saw her again when she was 27 and 
apparently she had a meth problem.

3550
02:38:58,130 --> 02:39:01,040
Oh.
And when I saw her when she was 27,

3551
02:39:01,041 --> 02:39:06,041
she looked like she had been to hell and
back and she looked easily 50 and she 

3552
02:39:07,011 --> 02:39:09,260
wasn't even 30 yet and I was like,
wow,

3553
02:39:09,290 --> 02:39:12,020
like meth,
something about stimulants,

3554
02:39:12,021 --> 02:39:12,350
man.

3555
02:39:12,350 --> 02:39:17,350
You that red lining the system,
but what you pay for that you pay for 

3556
02:39:18,201 --> 02:39:19,550
that,
what drives you out?

3557
02:39:20,780 --> 02:39:22,220
She looked terrible.
Yeah.

3558
02:39:22,280 --> 02:39:26,510
Terrifying to her skin was hanging off 
of her bones or muscle tissue.

3559
02:39:26,511 --> 02:39:27,930
It all gone away.
She,

3560
02:39:27,960 --> 02:39:29,900
it'd all atrophied.
So like,

3561
02:39:29,901 --> 02:39:32,480
or like what?
The plumpness of youth.

3562
02:39:32,540 --> 02:39:37,160
It all been replaced by like this dead 
air and her skin was looking for all the

3563
02:39:37,161 --> 02:39:39,290
meat that used to be there to hold it in
place.

3564
02:39:39,330 --> 02:39:41,460
It was just sagging and oh my.
And you know,

3565
02:39:41,490 --> 02:39:42,980
she chained,
smoked the whole time.

3566
02:39:43,190 --> 02:39:44,730
She was definitely chainsmoking.
She's,

3567
02:39:44,920 --> 02:39:49,700
she was a smoker,
but it was sad and she was so apologetic

3568
02:39:49,701 --> 02:39:50,070
about,
oh,

3569
02:39:50,090 --> 02:39:51,790
she was apologetic about the way she 
looked.

3570
02:39:51,791 --> 02:39:53,960
It was really disturbing.
Yeah.

3571
02:39:53,961 --> 02:39:58,961
I just saw this girl that I hadn't seen 
in awhile and she gave me a hug and she 

3572
02:39:58,961 --> 02:39:58,961
goes,
I'm sorry,

3573
02:39:58,961 --> 02:40:01,940
I got really fat,
like you're apologizing to me.

3574
02:40:02,510 --> 02:40:05,390
Like that is so weird.
It might be the same person did the same

3575
02:40:05,391 --> 02:40:07,580
thing to me.
We'll talk about it off air now.

3576
02:40:07,750 --> 02:40:09,320
I don't think so.
This girl is never on trucks.

3577
02:40:09,321 --> 02:40:12,020
You just put on a different girl.
Just did that recently to me.

3578
02:40:12,180 --> 02:40:13,530
Okay.

3579
02:40:13,540 --> 02:40:14,210
Yeah.
Yeah.

3580
02:40:14,970 --> 02:40:19,970
We'll talk.
We'll talk about this is we've got to 

3581
02:40:19,970 --> 02:40:21,831
end this thing anyway.

3584
