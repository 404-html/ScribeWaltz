1
00:00:01,290 --> 00:00:06,290
You don't want them to know,
boom and live Erik Griffin.

2
00:00:07,470 --> 00:00:10,830
So we were talking before this podcast,
how you mix it up with the android

3
00:00:10,831 --> 00:00:14,250
watch,
but the apple phone that's very curious

4
00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:14,791
it.
We'll see.

5
00:00:14,791 --> 00:00:18,360
I used to be all Samsung.
I love the android and the watches.

6
00:00:18,390 --> 00:00:19,500
Great.
I love how it interacts,

7
00:00:19,501 --> 00:00:22,500
but then I get a girlfriend who has an
iphone.

8
00:00:22,610 --> 00:00:23,281
Right.
She's like,

9
00:00:23,281 --> 00:00:26,550
I want to have face time with you,
so why don't you tell her to get skype,

10
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:29,250
skype APP.
You married,

11
00:00:29,251 --> 00:00:31,320
you understand what you can't.
Anyway,

12
00:00:31,730 --> 00:00:33,490
I got set standards.
Yeah.

13
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:34,260
Wow.
Hey,

14
00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:39,030
I'm not the stamp lines in the sand,
but then they have like a.

15
00:00:39,270 --> 00:00:43,830
They had this app on the apple now
called gear which lets you hook up your

16
00:00:43,831 --> 00:00:45,780
phone but you can't really interact with
it.

17
00:00:45,810 --> 00:00:48,360
You can't like talk or anything,
but it's actually kind of Nice.

18
00:00:48,361 --> 00:00:50,730
You just want to know stuff's going on.
It's probably.

19
00:00:50,731 --> 00:00:52,200
Yeah.
We were saying it's probably better that

20
00:00:52,201 --> 00:00:57,150
you can't interact with it because Jamie
was telling me that they could do walkie

21
00:00:57,151 --> 00:00:58,980
talkie with your iphones now.

22
00:00:59,530 --> 00:01:01,340
Yeah.
They're still being announced right now.

23
00:01:01,341 --> 00:01:04,910
So I don't know all the details,
but the worldwide developers conference

24
00:01:04,911 --> 00:01:08,720
is going on the WWDC,
so they're not new operating system.

25
00:01:08,721 --> 00:01:12,530
The new Apple Watch and the new all like
automatic workout detection,

26
00:01:12,531 --> 00:01:14,480
walkie talkie mode and something else.

27
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:17,040
There's just too much.
I have an apple watch too.

28
00:01:17,041 --> 00:01:17,980
I love it.
You can leave it at,

29
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:20,700
at least sometimes I'll leave my phone.
I don't even bring my phone with me,

30
00:01:20,790 --> 00:01:21,660
you know,
because you can.

31
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:23,610
Uh.
Do you feel weird when you do that?

32
00:01:24,030 --> 00:01:26,070
Because he's a rebel.
Here's what's happening now though,

33
00:01:26,071 --> 00:01:29,100
like if I have my watch.
So when you look at your watch,

34
00:01:29,101 --> 00:01:32,640
what does that cue he accused like you
want to go or you're missing out on or.

35
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:36,600
I know now when you do that it's just
because you're looking at a text

36
00:01:36,601 --> 00:01:39,650
message.
So now it's just as rude as it just.

37
00:01:39,910 --> 00:01:41,310
We're not.
This isn't helping.

38
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:42,750
It's not helping them.
When I go,

39
00:01:43,030 --> 00:01:45,030
if I'm looking and you were talking and
I go like this,

40
00:01:45,031 --> 00:01:47,350
I'm looked down and you think you just
have to go someplace.

41
00:01:47,780 --> 00:01:48,640
Yeah.
No,

42
00:01:48,670 --> 00:01:50,280
not just got a text too much,
right?

43
00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:51,180
Yeah,
I just got a tweet,

44
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:52,610
I got to retweet.
I looking at,

45
00:01:52,630 --> 00:01:53,850
you know,
that's what are we doing,

46
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:55,170
what are we doing?
I have no idea.

47
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:57,750
And you know,
what's really weird about all this

48
00:01:57,751 --> 00:01:59,220
stuff?
The phones and how we talk.

49
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:02,280
Everybody wants to text like you can't
get people to call you.

50
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:05,130
You can't get people to a now and now
they're putting the little emojis.

51
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:05,881
Right?
Right.

52
00:02:05,881 --> 00:02:08,460
And then from the mode,
now they're putting like gifts of real

53
00:02:08,461 --> 00:02:10,560
people.
So this is how I feel.

54
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:12,040
So we're,
we're,

55
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:15,090
we're going in a circle because we want
human interaction,

56
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:17,220
we want connection,
we want to see people.

57
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:19,800
So now we're putting,
they're putting a celebrity up.

58
00:02:20,050 --> 00:02:23,880
Like this is how I feel today.
Why don't you put how you feel today,

59
00:02:24,090 --> 00:02:25,470
right?
Not Chris,

60
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:27,990
Pat Pratt,
rolling a garbage can or something.

61
00:02:28,050 --> 00:02:31,140
This is my mood.
So we're slowly getting back to where

62
00:02:31,141 --> 00:02:34,200
it's going to be.
We're going to actually be talking to a

63
00:02:34,201 --> 00:02:37,210
real person thinks so you didn't come
all the way around or I think it's going

64
00:02:37,211 --> 00:02:38,160
to come all the way around.
Hmm,

65
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:39,620
well this is this Jamie

66
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:42,180
thing.
They showed it's you're making a Emoji

67
00:02:42,181 --> 00:02:43,800
of yourself called me Mochi.

68
00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:45,820
They already do that with Sandra
Samsung,

69
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:48,070
like it's working in the wrapping them
off.

70
00:02:48,130 --> 00:02:50,250
This is what I'm working together.
This is what I'm saying.

71
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:55,510
We're searching for trying to find ways
to be more ourselves.

72
00:02:56,680 --> 00:03:00,280
You don't need an Emoji of yourself.
Just be yourself

73
00:03:00,310 --> 00:03:01,960
that they're going against each other.
Oh,

74
00:03:01,990 --> 00:03:04,570
there's tax on Samsung.
Ar Emoji.

75
00:03:04,571 --> 00:03:06,580
Yeah.
They ripped off the idea for cheap

76
00:03:06,581 --> 00:03:10,570
fucks.
Hakan on like ripping people off now.

77
00:03:10,571 --> 00:03:15,070
They were first with the iphone.
The iphone was the first of these kinds

78
00:03:15,071 --> 00:03:16,750
of things.
The first iphone,

79
00:03:17,110 --> 00:03:20,020
but androids are real close now.
They're real close.

80
00:03:20,021 --> 00:03:22,930
I mean it's very debate,
but everything after that they were

81
00:03:22,931 --> 00:03:24,010
late,
like really?

82
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:26,890
Like on an android.
You could copy and paste on an android

83
00:03:27,850 --> 00:03:30,690
three years before you could do it.
Oh right.

84
00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:32,810
An apple.
So you've always been an android guy?

85
00:03:32,820 --> 00:03:34,750
I've always been andrew guys get another
android.

86
00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:38,610
I know I'm going girlfriend.
I'm the man.

87
00:03:38,620 --> 00:03:40,750
You get an Android,
you get it.

88
00:03:40,830 --> 00:03:42,310
You get an android,
little skype it.

89
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:46,150
It'll be me giving bite Hernandez,
native to Android,

90
00:03:46,180 --> 00:03:49,890
like uh,
like the facetime thing is,

91
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:52,150
there's something that's on the revenue
they have,

92
00:03:52,151 --> 00:03:54,220
like they have like their own version of
that.

93
00:03:54,250 --> 00:03:56,500
They have their own version of that,
but I don't think people really use it.

94
00:03:56,501 --> 00:03:58,600
They have their own like Samsung video
though.

95
00:03:58,610 --> 00:04:02,380
But Samsung has one but just like what
if you have say like a Google Pixel

96
00:04:02,381 --> 00:04:03,090
phone?
Yeah.

97
00:04:03,090 --> 00:04:05,680
That they might have,
but I don't think enough people have a

98
00:04:05,681 --> 00:04:07,630
google pixel phone to make that even a
thing.

99
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:08,650
Oh really?
Yeah.

100
00:04:08,650 --> 00:04:10,510
I thought those were really popular.
And are they who?

101
00:04:10,511 --> 00:04:13,900
Do you know if any one person you know,
that has a Google Pixel could call me.

102
00:04:14,020 --> 00:04:14,840
I have one.
You know,

103
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:16,630
you do not have a Google Pixel.
Do have one?

104
00:04:16,790 --> 00:04:18,550
Do you use it?
Okay.

105
00:04:18,551 --> 00:04:21,250
So you were given a Google Bot one.
Why?

106
00:04:21,340 --> 00:04:23,620
Because I wanted to try it out.
But here's what happened.

107
00:04:24,910 --> 00:04:29,500
I couldn't get text messages to work.
This is the scam because you are hooked

108
00:04:29,501 --> 00:04:30,810
up to this.
Uh,

109
00:04:31,090 --> 00:04:31,630
what are you showing me?

110
00:04:31,630 --> 00:04:33,880
Jamie said they do have it.
It's with the Pixel two or something

111
00:04:33,881 --> 00:04:36,160
like that.
Maybe it's android video calling.

112
00:04:36,540 --> 00:04:38,680
It just simplifies.
Enjoyed video calling.

113
00:04:38,770 --> 00:04:40,180
Oh,
I'll get that.

114
00:04:40,181 --> 00:04:43,570
So does that only work with android?
Android to android.

115
00:04:44,580 --> 00:04:47,050
Okay.
I don't know why they don't just work

116
00:04:47,051 --> 00:04:50,290
together.
Why does an apple example just work

117
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:52,090
together?
They don't work together with text

118
00:04:52,091 --> 00:04:52,800
message.
See this.

119
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:55,660
My point is really annoying.
The I message thing is what?

120
00:04:55,661 --> 00:04:59,510
Fuck me.
Because everybody knew that I had an

121
00:04:59,530 --> 00:05:01,990
iphone so they would send me because
they have an iphone.

122
00:05:01,991 --> 00:05:06,340
They would send me an I message and so I
was sending people text messages to like

123
00:05:06,370 --> 00:05:09,100
I'm not getting it.
I'm like send me one and they would send

124
00:05:09,101 --> 00:05:12,370
me one and I wouldn't get it.
And so then I went online and looked it

125
00:05:12,371 --> 00:05:15,550
up and it said you have to disable I
message.

126
00:05:15,580 --> 00:05:17,170
Okay.
So I disabled my message.

127
00:05:17,470 --> 00:05:21,100
Then you have to call up.
You have to actually call up someone.

128
00:05:21,130 --> 00:05:24,250
I'm done at that point.
At that point you have to call up

129
00:05:24,251 --> 00:05:29,251
someone and tell them to take your email
address off of the I message database.

130
00:05:31,390 --> 00:05:34,660
Okay.
So I do that and I say take this email.

131
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:37,450
Well why are you doing that sir?
Because I switched over to an android

132
00:05:37,451 --> 00:05:38,500
phone.
There's like pause,

133
00:05:38,501 --> 00:05:42,250
like I just fucking killed the queen.
Like come on,

134
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:46,240
like you heard an alarm go off.
I'm one of millions of fucking people

135
00:05:46,241 --> 00:05:48,100
out there.
You don't know anything about me.

136
00:05:48,101 --> 00:05:50,830
Why do you care?
Why would you give a fuck what they

137
00:05:50,831 --> 00:05:52,030
like?
They literally,

138
00:05:52,031 --> 00:05:55,150
the guy on the phone,
I felt bad that I was switching over.

139
00:05:55,390 --> 00:05:56,420
So then,
um,

140
00:05:56,470 --> 00:05:58,460
it still wouldn't.
I mean it didn't work for Dow.

141
00:05:58,461 --> 00:06:02,660
Get like one out of three text messages
and it all happened while I was on

142
00:06:02,661 --> 00:06:03,440
vacation.

143
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:06,200
I just figured I'm going to try this
phone while I'm on vacation.

144
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:07,490
Fuck around.
But you can't.

145
00:06:07,510 --> 00:06:08,960
They got,
you roped in with that.

146
00:06:08,980 --> 00:06:12,050
Goddamn that I messaged shit.
Yeah.

147
00:06:12,051 --> 00:06:15,950
That's the apples thing.
No matter where you are in the world and

148
00:06:15,951 --> 00:06:17,450
all that.
People have apple.

149
00:06:17,451 --> 00:06:19,580
A lot of,
I think Samsung has taken over in terms

150
00:06:19,581 --> 00:06:21,010
of life for android.
You know,

151
00:06:21,380 --> 00:06:23,630
I love the Samsung phones,
didn't make good phones.

152
00:06:23,631 --> 00:06:26,540
They make great phones.
The difference between the androids

153
00:06:26,541 --> 00:06:30,620
though is that Samsung does not update
their software very often.

154
00:06:30,621 --> 00:06:32,750
Their update,
they update security patches but they

155
00:06:32,751 --> 00:06:36,440
don't need to.
But Google Pixel phones get the latest

156
00:06:36,441 --> 00:06:40,760
software right when it gets released and
so like when Oreo comes out,

157
00:06:40,761 --> 00:06:44,420
an eight point one,
all these different operating systems

158
00:06:44,421 --> 00:06:48,680
come out there better supposedly for
like for how long a week.

159
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:51,360
I mean we know it takes a long time
before they come out on St.

160
00:06:51,410 --> 00:06:53,120
on Samsung phones.
Long time.

161
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:55,190
Like six months sometimes.
Oh really?

162
00:06:55,191 --> 00:06:56,150
Yeah.
It takes a long time.

163
00:06:56,180 --> 00:06:58,460
Well there you go.
You heard it break the breaking news

164
00:06:58,461 --> 00:07:00,620
right here.
Maybe that's what the problem was.

165
00:07:00,770 --> 00:07:01,581
Yeah,
but it also.

166
00:07:01,581 --> 00:07:05,120
Samsung puts their own shit over android
and Ios.

167
00:07:05,430 --> 00:07:09,170
Real android dorks want pure android and
pure android.

168
00:07:09,171 --> 00:07:11,540
You really only get with the pixel
unless you can.

169
00:07:11,710 --> 00:07:14,350
Are you.
Do you know about how do you like,

170
00:07:14,420 --> 00:07:16,280
can you hack them?
You can hack them,

171
00:07:16,281 --> 00:07:18,060
right?
We can like how you use,

172
00:07:18,140 --> 00:07:21,320
what do they call it?
Jail break your phone and all that kind

173
00:07:21,321 --> 00:07:23,390
of stuff.
They've made that just common now

174
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:25,500
because it used to be like they,
they,

175
00:07:25,610 --> 00:07:28,310
they would lock it down where like let's
say you had verizon,

176
00:07:28,580 --> 00:07:33,050
so you could only use this phone on
verizon with verizon stuff and then you

177
00:07:33,051 --> 00:07:36,290
would jailbreaker then you couldn't like
open it up to like all these other types

178
00:07:36,291 --> 00:07:37,124
of apps.

179
00:07:37,700 --> 00:07:41,660
If they would stop being greedy freaks,
just stop being so greedy.

180
00:07:41,810 --> 00:07:44,930
Let me use my phone however I want.
I'm still going to be on your system.

181
00:07:44,931 --> 00:07:48,430
I'm still paying your $200 a month for
your stupid phone.

182
00:07:48,431 --> 00:07:51,590
A surface and you do a little,
a little extra,

183
00:07:51,780 --> 00:07:54,140
a little extra,
extra little extra.

184
00:07:54,390 --> 00:07:56,180
Don't get me started on that when you
started.

185
00:07:56,250 --> 00:08:00,680
I know motherfucker and I can't believe
the shit we have to deal with.

186
00:08:00,740 --> 00:08:02,950
Eric Griffin.
God dammit.

187
00:08:04,070 --> 00:08:05,810
That was weird though,
man.

188
00:08:05,811 --> 00:08:06,890
It's like,
it's weird.

189
00:08:06,891 --> 00:08:08,900
There's only two.
That's also weird.

190
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:12,440
There's only two operating systems
heating side aside,

191
00:08:12,441 --> 00:08:16,220
but that's how we are in our country.
We can only Republican or Democrat.

192
00:08:16,490 --> 00:08:18,830
Apple or android.
Do you remember windows?

193
00:08:18,831 --> 00:08:19,491
Phone.
Windows.

194
00:08:19,491 --> 00:08:23,480
Phone wasn't bad.
It wasn't that bad.

195
00:08:23,510 --> 00:08:25,130
I had a friend who had a windows phone.
I was like,

196
00:08:25,131 --> 00:08:25,970
oh,
this is kinda cool.

197
00:08:25,970 --> 00:08:29,120
It had tiles.
It was like windows 10 windows,

198
00:08:29,121 --> 00:08:33,830
10 books with titles like a Cayman went.
Nobody cares about that and went look at

199
00:08:33,831 --> 00:08:36,380
you just like I can't.
I can't deal with.

200
00:08:36,860 --> 00:08:39,560
I don't want to hear what everybody's
trying to get into the phone game,

201
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,910
but what's crazy is how many people have
windows computers.

202
00:08:44,060 --> 00:08:46,370
It's amazing that windows had a phone
and people are like,

203
00:08:46,590 --> 00:08:49,040
Nah,
because they know all the problems they

204
00:08:49,041 --> 00:08:51,050
had with their.
With their computer.

205
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:54,290
I stopped.
I can't even remember the last time I

206
00:08:54,291 --> 00:08:57,510
had a windows.
I strictly went app because it's just so

207
00:08:57,511 --> 00:09:00,990
easy to use and it's still not easy to
use.

208
00:09:01,260 --> 00:09:04,980
You know what's not easy though?
I'm apple does not have good keyboards.

209
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:09,660
Like if you have a desktop keyboard at
home and you can add a second keyboard,

210
00:09:09,690 --> 00:09:11,880
you know like by a mechanical keyboard.

211
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:14,490
If you're a writer,
if you like to write.

212
00:09:15,190 --> 00:09:18,150
The problem with apple keyboards is
there's no key travel.

213
00:09:18,180 --> 00:09:19,890
It's very,
very shallow,

214
00:09:20,070 --> 00:09:22,200
so it's like a just a tiny movement.
Click,

215
00:09:22,230 --> 00:09:22,561
click,
click,

216
00:09:22,561 --> 00:09:23,394
click,
click.

217
00:09:23,830 --> 00:09:27,270
What I use is I use a think pad and the,
one of the reasons why I use the

218
00:09:27,271 --> 00:09:30,170
thinkpad is there's like travel to these
keys.

219
00:09:31,740 --> 00:09:36,090
These keys have motion to them.
Like if you just your old school.

220
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:38,550
Yeah.
Well the thing is you feel where the

221
00:09:38,551 --> 00:09:40,650
keys are,
you feel like.

222
00:09:40,651 --> 00:09:44,910
So as you're typing I can just look at
the screen and I don't have to look down

223
00:09:44,911 --> 00:09:48,000
at the keyboard and they depressed with
your fingers.

224
00:09:48,540 --> 00:09:49,920
Yeah,
there's motion to it.

225
00:09:49,921 --> 00:09:52,530
So there's no accidental pressing of the
keys.

226
00:09:52,590 --> 00:09:54,600
Did you take typing in high school?
Yes.

227
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:56,310
I don't remember any of it though.
Yeah,

228
00:09:56,311 --> 00:09:58,050
me too.
I might have my high school year.

229
00:09:58,050 --> 00:10:01,050
Was it last year that they had typing at
my school?

230
00:10:01,260 --> 00:10:02,100
Really?
Yeah.

231
00:10:02,170 --> 00:10:05,460
I remember they were saying like this is
the longer.

232
00:10:05,490 --> 00:10:08,160
Because they had a computer class that
they were starting.

233
00:10:08,790 --> 00:10:09,780
I just thought,
damn,

234
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:11,880
like I look back on this things and I
just go,

235
00:10:11,881 --> 00:10:15,690
wow,
how times have changed our generation.

236
00:10:15,691 --> 00:10:20,220
Is this like generation that is like we
went through the first of all of these

237
00:10:20,221 --> 00:10:22,170
things.
I had a commodore 64.

238
00:10:22,380 --> 00:10:23,161
Did you?
Yes,

239
00:10:23,161 --> 00:10:25,840
I remember the first apple laptop.
I remember.

240
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:30,920
I remember like when games systems
changed and color TV and call waiting

241
00:10:31,021 --> 00:10:33,500
and like all the things that we were,
you know,

242
00:10:33,750 --> 00:10:35,730
their answering machine answering
machine to.

243
00:10:35,731 --> 00:10:38,010
They know,
they know more answering machines and

244
00:10:38,300 --> 00:10:40,680
can even apply in Israel machines nine,
seven,

245
00:10:40,681 --> 00:10:43,340
six numbers and you know,
like all,

246
00:10:43,350 --> 00:10:45,210
all of that stuff was life.
Sex Lines.

247
00:10:45,340 --> 00:10:46,240
Yeah.
Yeah.

248
00:10:46,290 --> 00:10:46,760
Good call.

249
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:47,221
Like,
Oh God,

250
00:10:47,221 --> 00:10:49,770
I got in trouble one time,
like thank God I was calling a

251
00:10:49,771 --> 00:10:51,570
Christmas,
I was going to call the Christmas one

252
00:10:51,571 --> 00:10:55,440
first and then I was going to call the
sex one and then I called the Christmas

253
00:10:55,441 --> 00:10:58,680
one first and then my mom picks up the
other one and I hang up and then my

254
00:10:58,681 --> 00:11:00,060
mom's like,
Erica,

255
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:03,510
are you talking to Santa Claus?
Oh Shit.

256
00:11:03,511 --> 00:11:06,930
How old were you at?
Thirteen isn't like that,

257
00:11:06,931 --> 00:11:08,280
you know,
like just getting into your,

258
00:11:08,281 --> 00:11:11,130
you know,
so like even just even how we find porn

259
00:11:11,131 --> 00:11:14,110
is different now.
Like it's so like when I'm looking,

260
00:11:14,130 --> 00:11:16,050
I'm thinking about you talking about
just keyboard.

261
00:11:16,051 --> 00:11:17,880
It still has a little bit of old school
too.

262
00:11:17,881 --> 00:11:20,340
It has an old school feel to what you're
saying.

263
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:22,890
You know you still have a.
anytime somebody is using windows.

264
00:11:22,891 --> 00:11:23,490
I know.
It's like,

265
00:11:23,490 --> 00:11:24,010
oh they're.

266
00:11:24,010 --> 00:11:26,220
They're connected to the past still.
Well,

267
00:11:26,310 --> 00:11:28,530
I just switched over to a reasonably
when I.

268
00:11:28,530 --> 00:11:31,080
I fucked around with a thinkpad one day
and I was like,

269
00:11:31,140 --> 00:11:33,660
wow,
this keyboard is so much better because

270
00:11:33,661 --> 00:11:36,410
I have a Mac book to one of them.
New Mac book pros.

271
00:11:36,450 --> 00:11:37,920
You just,
you just can't handle it.

272
00:11:38,930 --> 00:11:41,340
It's just not a good keyboard.
It's shit.

273
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:43,800
It's not just bad.
It's shit.

274
00:11:44,790 --> 00:11:46,950
It's shit.
And there's no options.

275
00:11:46,951 --> 00:11:50,100
Like if you want a laptop,
they don't give you options for

276
00:11:50,101 --> 00:11:50,631
keyboard.
Yeah.

277
00:11:50,631 --> 00:11:53,590
You can't customize the now and you can
get a different one.

278
00:11:53,591 --> 00:11:56,320
Like if you want windows,
you can get an a seuss.

279
00:11:56,321 --> 00:11:59,690
You can get,
you can get you a shit ton.

280
00:11:59,691 --> 00:12:02,140
There's get a dell desktop though.
I have an Imac.

281
00:12:02,170 --> 00:12:03,340
You can hook up.
Sure.

282
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:04,430
Yeah,
with the desktop.

283
00:12:04,431 --> 00:12:06,070
But the problem is,
most of my shit,

284
00:12:06,071 --> 00:12:08,680
I go in the Oh,
third class action lawsuit over Mac

285
00:12:08,681 --> 00:12:09,700
book,
Pro Keyboard,

286
00:12:09,910 --> 00:12:12,220
allegedly fraudulent concealment.

287
00:12:12,490 --> 00:12:14,710
This guy's a research king right here.
Let's see.

288
00:12:14,770 --> 00:12:17,980
But look at that keyboard.
Look how fucking shallow those keys are.

289
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:20,410
That's bullshit west to keep it thin,
man.

290
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:22,510
But it doesn't matter.
That's bad for a writer.

291
00:12:22,540 --> 00:12:24,790
If you're a writer,
that's a shitty design.

292
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:26,770
Remember how thick too?
Yeah.

293
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:29,200
But make it a little thicker.
Jesus Christ.

294
00:12:29,201 --> 00:12:32,050
Who gives a fuck if it's an extra half a
millimeter,

295
00:12:32,051 --> 00:12:35,530
if you have good keyboard feel.
I mean it depends on what you're doing.

296
00:12:35,531 --> 00:12:38,860
If you're the type of person just writes
an email every now and then,

297
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:41,590
but I fucking right.
I need a keyboard.

298
00:12:41,620 --> 00:12:44,610
I feel you need it so I could take a
beating too.

299
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:46,390
Yeah,
I still fuck around with that when I,

300
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:48,160
you know,
I still have it so I fuck around with

301
00:12:48,161 --> 00:12:48,994
that.
If I,

302
00:12:49,090 --> 00:12:51,190
if I travel,
if I go online,

303
00:12:51,191 --> 00:12:54,220
if I'm just just web surfing,
it's fine for that.

304
00:12:54,850 --> 00:12:57,370
But it sucks a fat one.
When it deals with.

305
00:12:57,490 --> 00:13:00,580
Did you get a text message?
I'm already getting messages about this

306
00:13:00,581 --> 00:13:04,720
and it's just coming to the
phone's gonna like,

307
00:13:04,721 --> 00:13:08,050
but the only time my phone is blowing up
like this before is when the Justin

308
00:13:08,051 --> 00:13:12,790
bieber posted a picture with him.
I'm with you on his instagram and then

309
00:13:12,791 --> 00:13:15,610
my phone was shaking,
shaking for,

310
00:13:15,780 --> 00:13:17,990
for,
for a month straight from

311
00:13:19,550 --> 00:13:20,770
you guys.
Nobody believed me.

312
00:13:20,771 --> 00:13:24,730
Let me turn on their notifications and I
put it down like this and it's just like

313
00:13:24,731 --> 00:13:27,250
I'm talking about daggone thousands of
notifications.

314
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:29,470
That guy could topple a government if
you really want it to.

315
00:13:29,471 --> 00:13:32,390
Like if it got political,
that's a problem.

316
00:13:33,250 --> 00:13:34,660
That's what we're dealing with with
trump.

317
00:13:34,750 --> 00:13:36,670
A famous person who becomes the
president.

318
00:13:37,060 --> 00:13:39,540
I mean this little kid is only 24,
right?

319
00:13:39,610 --> 00:13:42,240
What the fuck out is?
Even if he didn't mean 24,

320
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:43,210
just turned 24.

321
00:13:43,210 --> 00:13:44,043
Yeah.
Okay.

322
00:13:44,190 --> 00:13:47,350
Jaymes hate jaymes hate.
It's actually a good kid.

323
00:13:47,710 --> 00:13:49,230
He really is.
But if I gave you one,

324
00:13:49,270 --> 00:13:52,030
if I gave you $100,000,000 and no
parental supervision,

325
00:13:52,090 --> 00:13:56,500
you'd do some dumb shit to do way worse
listening right now.

326
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:59,860
I would do a lot of dumb shit if you
gave me 100 million dollars just out of

327
00:13:59,861 --> 00:14:00,950
nowhere.
Out of nowhere.

328
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:05,050
He's done well for what he is,
you know,

329
00:14:05,051 --> 00:14:06,850
the kind of fame that,
that guy possessive.

330
00:14:07,300 --> 00:14:08,680
He's off the charts famous.
Yeah,

331
00:14:08,681 --> 00:14:08,990
yeah,
yeah.

332
00:14:08,990 --> 00:14:10,210
Yeah.
But then some was.

333
00:14:10,280 --> 00:14:12,400
So it was trump.
Trump was super famous,

334
00:14:12,460 --> 00:14:13,660
super,
super famous.

335
00:14:14,100 --> 00:14:16,420
This is why we can't get rid of the
electoral college though by the way.

336
00:14:16,421 --> 00:14:19,990
Not to get political but does help.
But I mean did he rigged that?

337
00:14:20,210 --> 00:14:22,450
But you can't make it but played the
game.

338
00:14:22,451 --> 00:14:24,610
Well,
I can't have a popularity contest,

339
00:14:24,670 --> 00:14:26,380
but it is a popularity contest no matter
what.

340
00:14:26,410 --> 00:14:29,650
Even with the Electoral College,
we just have to be popular in Iowa.

341
00:14:30,460 --> 00:14:33,820
Popular in Ohio know how to do that and
just go over there and talk about

342
00:14:33,821 --> 00:14:35,230
Muslims.
Shake your fist.

343
00:14:35,290 --> 00:14:37,450
Why don't we,
I still don't understand why we don't

344
00:14:37,451 --> 00:14:42,451
just have online voting app or like or
like or with your phone.

345
00:14:43,181 --> 00:14:46,540
Like you have to have a frame and then
you register your phone so that Imi,

346
00:14:46,670 --> 00:14:50,700
he number that your phone has is
strictly for you.

347
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:51,500
You,
they,

348
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:52,040
they already

349
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:53,240
have,
what do you call it?

350
00:14:53,241 --> 00:14:55,710
Like facial recognition software.
You,

351
00:14:56,220 --> 00:14:59,450
their phones have fingerprint.
So there's like three different ways to

352
00:14:59,451 --> 00:15:02,450
like register and then you'll get
everyone's vote.

353
00:15:02,540 --> 00:15:05,210
I always say vote should be like the
Columbia DVD.

354
00:15:05,211 --> 00:15:06,680
How?
Remember Columbia Dvds,

355
00:15:07,090 --> 00:15:08,890
they would just send them just giving it
to you.

356
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:11,840
So if you're a Republican,
right?

357
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:14,600
Then your vote goes to the Republican
until you go.

358
00:15:14,810 --> 00:15:19,310
I don't want this from the numbers of
people that people don't know what we're

359
00:15:19,311 --> 00:15:21,020
talking about with Columbia DVD because
we're old.

360
00:15:21,260 --> 00:15:25,970
But back in the day you would sign up
for like cassette tapes and they would

361
00:15:25,971 --> 00:15:28,350
send you a bunch of cassettes.
Like you'd pick.

362
00:15:28,660 --> 00:15:30,200
Go to book club?
Yeah,

363
00:15:30,201 --> 00:15:32,030
that too.
But they would send them to you,

364
00:15:32,180 --> 00:15:35,350
but it was only like a dollar and you'd
get like 15 sets,

365
00:15:35,351 --> 00:15:37,980
you know,
you get like aerosmith and is it still

366
00:15:38,190 --> 00:15:38,470
on?

367
00:15:38,470 --> 00:15:40,970
It's still on but the fuck out and check
it out.

368
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:45,290
They finally made it so they don't just
send it automatically because people

369
00:15:45,291 --> 00:15:47,080
were.
People were quitting the service.

370
00:15:47,081 --> 00:15:49,010
Yeah,
but they would just send you.

371
00:15:49,011 --> 00:15:52,820
So you would pay and you had like say
three days and if you,

372
00:15:52,850 --> 00:15:55,820
if you didn't send it back,
they would charge you to $9.

373
00:15:55,850 --> 00:15:57,680
Right?
So that's what I'm saying about voting.

374
00:15:57,740 --> 00:16:00,980
This is how we should vote.
Thirty $5 page right there.

375
00:16:00,981 --> 00:16:03,530
He's showing us,
she'd be like all your candidates for

376
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:06,570
Democrat and if you don't eat them,
have three days to pick.

377
00:16:06,571 --> 00:16:08,090
And if you don't pick your vote goes to
them.

378
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:09,860
That's how they should do it.
Show me what you just showed me.

379
00:16:09,861 --> 00:16:11,840
What are you doing?
What'd you show them?

380
00:16:11,841 --> 00:16:13,370
Look on the details.
What does it say?

381
00:16:13,570 --> 00:16:16,400
It says it's $35 for like two,
something like that.

382
00:16:16,490 --> 00:16:18,260
Okay.
Free shipping is only eligible for

383
00:16:18,261 --> 00:16:21,320
orders of two.
Have more dvds with a sub total of $35.

384
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:24,020
Say preorders are not eligible for free
shipping.

385
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:26,810
Okay.
So they say it's free shipping,

386
00:16:26,811 --> 00:16:28,730
but it's not free shipping.
Is that what they're doing?

387
00:16:29,510 --> 00:16:32,270
And they say it's 95 each.
But free shipping,

388
00:16:32,271 --> 00:16:36,950
that's more than $35 free shipping on
two plus dvds,

389
00:16:36,951 --> 00:16:41,120
but the dvds or nine 95.
So two plus is what for?

390
00:16:41,150 --> 00:16:44,200
Because it has to be more than $35.
You fucking crux.

391
00:16:44,690 --> 00:16:48,110
They're all crooks.
The record companies are so gross,

392
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:50,300
dude.
I've been talking to people that had

393
00:16:50,301 --> 00:16:53,510
Steven Tyler and here was explaining
what happens now with streaming,

394
00:16:53,511 --> 00:16:55,010
so that was great by the way.
Oh,

395
00:16:55,011 --> 00:16:56,000
thank you.
He's great,

396
00:16:56,001 --> 00:16:56,834
right?
Yeah.

397
00:16:57,530 --> 00:16:58,910
Fascinating.
Fascinating.

398
00:16:58,911 --> 00:17:01,820
I mean you want to talk about a guy who
was singing it all.

399
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:05,480
I'm never surprised when someone like
that with that type of personality.

400
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:08,450
I'm not surprised that you see the kind
of life and career he's had.

401
00:17:08,810 --> 00:17:12,200
Those people aren't there.
They're a notch above the norm.

402
00:17:12,290 --> 00:17:14,210
Yeah,
he's definitely a notch above the noise.

403
00:17:14,211 --> 00:17:16,790
Super sweet guy too.
Nice to everybody.

404
00:17:16,791 --> 00:17:18,650
Just oh,
hugging everybody.

405
00:17:18,651 --> 00:17:20,300
And really friendly as time of being
like.

406
00:17:20,820 --> 00:17:25,820
I'm sure there was a super dick.
You think so come on to some famous.

407
00:17:26,810 --> 00:17:31,370
You don't get that famous at the time
when people are treating you like just a

408
00:17:31,371 --> 00:17:32,540
god,
you know,

409
00:17:32,541 --> 00:17:35,240
everywhere he went.
I mean rock star,

410
00:17:35,750 --> 00:17:38,170
that was the pinnacle Rockstar.
A list.

411
00:17:38,180 --> 00:17:41,030
So a list actor,
professional athlete.

412
00:17:41,470 --> 00:17:44,150
That's the order,
but do you think they have to be dicks?

413
00:17:44,490 --> 00:17:44,751
No,
no,

414
00:17:44,751 --> 00:17:46,100
no.
Do you think they become dicks?

415
00:17:46,101 --> 00:17:49,120
But just because.
Here's my theory about that is that the

416
00:17:49,170 --> 00:17:51,570
fame,
that level of fame is overwhelming.

417
00:17:51,850 --> 00:17:55,350
People grabbing at you all the time,
so you just develop this dickie thing

418
00:17:55,351 --> 00:17:56,850
just to keep people the fuck away from
you.

419
00:17:57,180 --> 00:18:01,260
Like if you get to that,
I would imagine like that Michael Jordan

420
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:06,500
or a even bieber mean that there's a
level where you can't go anywhere.

421
00:18:06,700 --> 00:18:07,350
Listen,
I've been.

422
00:18:07,350 --> 00:18:08,760
I've been around Bieber.
Yeah.

423
00:18:08,761 --> 00:18:10,160
What's it like?
He's not an.

424
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:14,040
He's never alone.
He's always got somebody there.

425
00:18:14,180 --> 00:18:19,180
I don't think he trusts anyone and that
level of fame where you're just also

426
00:18:20,371 --> 00:18:21,780
used to,
you know,

427
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:25,560
get me a water or get the car.
I want to go here.

428
00:18:26,070 --> 00:18:28,380
When you get used to,
that becomes normal.

429
00:18:28,410 --> 00:18:30,630
Just telling people.
Just telling people what to do becomes

430
00:18:30,631 --> 00:18:31,464
normal.
Listen,

431
00:18:31,540 --> 00:18:33,930
I was at,
I was at a party and he was.

432
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:37,200
He was there and he's,
he's playing his music for his new album

433
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:38,880
and he just looks at me and he says,
Hey,

434
00:18:38,881 --> 00:18:40,410
can you give me a,
can you give me a vodka?

435
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:41,820
He says,
give me a vodka.

436
00:18:42,090 --> 00:18:43,800
And then I went.
I was like,

437
00:18:43,820 --> 00:18:44,670
okay,
you know,

438
00:18:47,550 --> 00:18:52,550
like I was so mad at myself
because I'm over here.

439
00:18:52,981 --> 00:18:53,301
Like,
oh,

440
00:18:53,301 --> 00:18:55,410
I gotta get back.
Excuse me.

441
00:18:56,670 --> 00:18:58,440
Everybody got away.
I got time.

442
00:18:58,680 --> 00:19:00,510
Yeah.
And then when I gave it to him I thought

443
00:19:00,511 --> 00:19:05,511
I should have said no,
fuck if I'm 47 years old,

444
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:10,580
what the fuck?
He was playing the piano at the same

445
00:19:10,590 --> 00:19:13,590
thing.
I was at the laugh factory and he was

446
00:19:13,591 --> 00:19:16,740
there.
He was watching and the scooter who's a

447
00:19:16,741 --> 00:19:17,910
buddy of mine,
scooter Braun,

448
00:19:18,390 --> 00:19:20,430
scooter comes down,
you know when he says,

449
00:19:20,431 --> 00:19:22,350
Hey Erica,
justin would like to see you.

450
00:19:22,650 --> 00:19:24,030
And I.
At first I was like,

451
00:19:24,570 --> 00:19:27,240
you don't submit a walkway,
you don't summon me,

452
00:19:29,210 --> 00:19:30,360
but of course I was like,
all right,

453
00:19:30,361 --> 00:19:31,194
let's go.

454
00:19:32,940 --> 00:19:36,330
I went and then like,
and then I saw him too and I was like,

455
00:19:36,331 --> 00:19:38,520
I realized like,
because I'm a nerd this way,

456
00:19:38,521 --> 00:19:40,660
I mean I'm a fan of all types of music,
so I'm not.

457
00:19:40,700 --> 00:19:42,810
I think the kids dynamic I think is very
talented.

458
00:19:42,820 --> 00:19:44,820
I don't think it's a surprise that he's
just famous,

459
00:19:44,860 --> 00:19:47,880
you know what I mean?
People get on him just by the way in

460
00:19:47,881 --> 00:19:51,720
defensive bieber real fast.
You can't tell somebody they're great

461
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:55,050
since they're eight years old,
eight years old.

462
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:57,210
You're great,
you're great when these nine,

463
00:19:57,270 --> 00:19:58,210
you're great.
When he's 10,

464
00:19:58,470 --> 00:19:59,640
you're great.
When he's 11,

465
00:19:59,670 --> 00:20:01,230
you're great.
Think about that.

466
00:20:01,290 --> 00:20:03,210
Then that 13 is probably when he first
went,

467
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:04,460
well,
am I putting,

468
00:20:04,580 --> 00:20:06,190
you know,
and then 15 it was like,

469
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:08,340
I'm not great.
I am great at 18.

470
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:10,930
Fucking great now.
And then when,

471
00:20:11,050 --> 00:20:13,650
when he finally says it,
then that's when everybody goes,

472
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:17,460
whoa Bro.
Tony down.

473
00:20:17,580 --> 00:20:19,590
It's too late.
The monsters already been let loose.

474
00:20:19,610 --> 00:20:21,060
Well,
he's already mature,

475
00:20:21,090 --> 00:20:22,230
right?
He's already become a,

476
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:27,320
an actual adult and he probably has no
come left in his body at any given time.

477
00:20:30,770 --> 00:20:35,190
Swinton low dude all day long.
It's just recovery time for him.

478
00:20:35,191 --> 00:20:36,450
He's got.
If he tweeted,

479
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:38,280
I need some pussy tonight.
Oh,

480
00:20:38,610 --> 00:20:41,520
it's out of control.
It would be like American idol auditions

481
00:20:41,710 --> 00:20:43,590
would be crazy than that.
If you've seen that.

482
00:20:43,591 --> 00:20:46,980
A Guatemalan volcano eruption,
have you seen

483
00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:52,750
people are running from the smog?
It's fucking crazy girls guys.

484
00:20:52,810 --> 00:20:57,370
It wouldn't be that much pussy coming
down the mountain headed towards you.

485
00:20:57,660 --> 00:21:00,670
It's that Guatemala eruption is fucking
scary,

486
00:21:00,671 --> 00:21:03,190
man.
There's nothing like that in comedy

487
00:21:03,310 --> 00:21:04,650
other than Chris Delea.
Yeah,

488
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:06,490
he's close.
He's close,

489
00:21:06,790 --> 00:21:10,750
but even looking at this Guatemala,
most violent eruption in more than 100

490
00:21:10,751 --> 00:21:13,240
years.
Twenty five people already dead and just

491
00:21:13,420 --> 00:21:16,750
think it just happened yesterday.
It's fucking crazy,

492
00:21:16,751 --> 00:21:18,900
man.
People have died after interrupted.

493
00:21:18,901 --> 00:21:20,590
Yeah.
Sunday is getting back at us.

494
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:22,180
Dude.
That's two right?

495
00:21:22,420 --> 00:21:25,450
Hawaii and this one.
I mean we've got to be real fucking

496
00:21:25,451 --> 00:21:26,410
careful.
Surprise.

497
00:21:26,411 --> 00:21:28,090
New Zealand hasn't had a couple of
options.

498
00:21:28,570 --> 00:21:30,880
Did they have like a live volcano in New
Zealand?

499
00:21:30,910 --> 00:21:34,420
I just know that I think.
Can you fact check this,

500
00:21:34,421 --> 00:21:36,640
but I think New Zealand has the most
volcanoes in the world.

501
00:21:36,820 --> 00:21:37,653
What?
Yeah,

502
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:38,700
yeah,
yeah.

503
00:21:38,700 --> 00:21:41,470
I was just the air tours and they're
like,

504
00:21:41,471 --> 00:21:42,820
you know,
what'd you do over there?

505
00:21:42,850 --> 00:21:44,260
Well,
I went to the Cook Islands.

506
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:45,580

507

509
00:21:51,551 --> 00:21:53,340
which is what I love you.
I can't get.

510
00:21:53,380 --> 00:21:56,470
I can't stand going someplace and it's
just all American.

511
00:21:56,471 --> 00:21:58,430
Like I don't go to Ensonata.

I didn't like to sit down.
I'm not a city guy.

537
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:45,310
I liked this kind of Shit,
like outdoors nature of beaches.

538
00:22:45,390 --> 00:22:47,170
Yeah.
Well the nature there is stunning.

539
00:22:47,290 --> 00:22:52,290
I want to look out my hotel window when

Rain forest,

543
00:22:59,530 --> 00:23:01,660
something.
Something that's different from this

544
00:23:01,690 --> 00:23:03,280
urban jungle that we live in all the
time.

545
00:23:03,330 --> 00:23:04,930
You have been in Costa Rica?
I have been.

546
00:23:05,470 --> 00:23:07,810
God just went to Costa Rica with my
girlfriend.

547
00:23:08,110 --> 00:23:10,210
We just started to get together and it
was,

548
00:23:10,211 --> 00:23:11,860
it was good to get together.
Yeah,

549
00:23:11,900 --> 00:23:13,040
we were close to Rico.
Yeah.

550
00:23:13,090 --> 00:23:14,920
Well I mean we,
I mean it was,

551
00:23:14,921 --> 00:23:17,850

552
00:23:17,851 --> 00:23:19,900
guys dating?
It was too soon.

553
00:23:19,901 --> 00:23:21,970
I thought maybe we'd be like four or
five months,

554
00:23:21,971 --> 00:23:24,350
you know,
but it was like Christmas time and I'm

555
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:25,011
with her.
I'm like,

556
00:23:25,011 --> 00:23:27,310
let me make this special.
So we go to Costa Rica,

557
00:23:27,340 --> 00:23:29,530
you know,
I do it up and she went to Christian and

558
00:23:29,620 --> 00:23:31,060
with you and not the family.
Yeah.

559
00:23:31,061 --> 00:23:32,250
Well she's Jewish,
so.

560
00:23:32,260 --> 00:23:33,093
Oh,
there you go.

561
00:23:33,810 --> 00:23:37,840
They're all monsters.
Dare you gotta be careful with that kind

562
00:23:37,841 --> 00:23:39,120
of time.
People,

563
00:23:40,100 --> 00:23:43,270
their career is over.
No,

564
00:23:43,271 --> 00:23:45,620
I'm just teasing about girls.
But girlfriend's Jewish had a beautiful

565
00:23:45,621 --> 00:23:46,160
family.

566
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:46,910
So,
uh,

567
00:23:46,910 --> 00:23:47,471
she was like,
well,

568
00:23:47,471 --> 00:23:49,280
I don't care about Christmas anyway,
so let's go.

569
00:23:49,620 --> 00:23:52,640
Don't go see my mom who moved to my
parents.

570
00:23:52,641 --> 00:23:54,590
Just moved to Malaga.
Where's that?

571
00:23:54,740 --> 00:23:55,920
In Spain.
Oh,

572
00:23:55,970 --> 00:23:58,130
they moved to like the southern tip of
Spain,

573
00:23:58,190 --> 00:24:00,050
you know,
because they went on a cruise one day,

574
00:24:00,051 --> 00:24:01,670
stopped in Malaga,
and then my mom's like,

575
00:24:01,671 --> 00:24:04,480
we got to come back here.
Cost of living is so low that they're

576
00:24:04,490 --> 00:24:09,080
living like kings over there,
like a great two bedroom condo with like

577
00:24:09,081 --> 00:24:12,020
a Malibu type view.
600 euro a month.

578
00:24:12,190 --> 00:24:12,801
Why?
Yeah.

579
00:24:12,801 --> 00:24:13,634
Dude,
it's,

580
00:24:13,790 --> 00:24:16,910
I'm telling you right now,
you got to look up the cost of living in

581
00:24:16,911 --> 00:24:17,660
Spain.
It's crazy.

582
00:24:17,660 --> 00:24:20,990
A lot of people from Britain,
they retire in Spain because our money

583
00:24:20,991 --> 00:24:22,220
goes a lot further.
Oh,

584
00:24:22,221 --> 00:24:24,740
I've heard that.
I've heard that people go there to avoid

585
00:24:24,741 --> 00:24:26,000
taxes from France.

586
00:24:26,020 --> 00:24:27,140
Yeah.
It's a lot of stuff,

587
00:24:27,141 --> 00:24:28,010
man.
So I take.

588
00:24:28,060 --> 00:24:30,680
So we go to Costa Rica and it was fine.
It was great.

589
00:24:31,070 --> 00:24:35,730
It was one of these resorts where like,
you could get room service 24 hours or

590
00:24:35,740 --> 00:24:37,370
do what you want.
It's all covered in the thing.

591
00:24:37,580 --> 00:24:39,560
But I got sick Joe.
Oh No,

592
00:24:39,740 --> 00:24:43,670
I knew it was high or Maria sec or what
kind of said it was every hole in my

593
00:24:43,671 --> 00:24:45,500
body,
something was coming out of it.

594
00:24:46,060 --> 00:24:48,010
Okay.
And then I was in bed.

595
00:24:48,011 --> 00:24:48,970
I was telling.
I said I don't,

596
00:24:48,980 --> 00:24:50,650
I don't feel good.
And I met.

597
00:24:50,680 --> 00:24:53,990
And then as a comic I'm making it.
I made a joke at her that she didn't

598
00:24:53,991 --> 00:24:56,240
appreciate.
She was mad at me about this joke.

599
00:24:56,360 --> 00:24:57,680
So at I'm also telling her like,
look,

600
00:24:57,710 --> 00:24:59,900
I'm not feeling well.
And then it happened.

601
00:25:00,140 --> 00:25:02,120
I get up and I have to vomit.

602
00:25:02,450 --> 00:25:04,400
And then there was nothing.
I vomited in my hands.

603
00:25:04,750 --> 00:25:07,520
I will run to the bathroom and then it's
just like,

604
00:25:07,521 --> 00:25:12,350
it's coming out of both holes
and this is going on for all night.

605
00:25:12,410 --> 00:25:13,101
I'm just,
I'm,

606
00:25:13,101 --> 00:25:15,440
I'm dead.
And the way she was acting,

607
00:25:15,500 --> 00:25:17,570
oh my God,
she was shocked.

608
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:18,920
She was like,
you're ruining the trend.

609
00:25:20,550 --> 00:25:22,470
So at the time I was like,
Ooh,

610
00:25:22,490 --> 00:25:24,550
well we weren't as close as we are now.
We've,

611
00:25:24,610 --> 00:25:28,640
we've since resolved the issue and.
But at the time I was like,

612
00:25:28,641 --> 00:25:30,870
I can't be with somebody that's not
gonna look.

613
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:34,880
Right.
She ordered room service while I was

614
00:25:37,910 --> 00:25:39,030
already writing it off.
Yeah.

615
00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:39,600
Yeah.
Just,

616
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:41,730
well I'm going to go ahead and get a
fucking cheeseburger.

617
00:25:41,940 --> 00:25:44,780
Then that was making me more sick.
The food smell.

618
00:25:44,950 --> 00:25:46,700
So I'm.
So I'm outside.

619
00:25:48,500 --> 00:25:51,260
But then she was like,
I was mad at you for your jokes and

620
00:25:51,261 --> 00:25:52,094
like,
you know,

621
00:25:52,580 --> 00:25:53,540
I always,
I always tell her,

622
00:25:53,541 --> 00:25:55,070
she goes,
she said to me one day,

623
00:25:55,071 --> 00:25:56,090
you know,
my brothers,

624
00:25:56,120 --> 00:25:59,560
they used to tease me all the time when
I was growing up that I said,

625
00:25:59,570 --> 00:26:00,920
why don't you get with a comic?

626
00:26:01,250 --> 00:26:03,290
Yeah.
Something's going on.

627
00:26:03,320 --> 00:26:04,790
If you know how we say we get with our
mother,

628
00:26:04,840 --> 00:26:05,590
you know,
or,

629
00:26:05,590 --> 00:26:06,423
or,
you know,

630
00:26:06,590 --> 00:26:08,620
whatever the qualities are.
So I think whatever,

631
00:26:08,660 --> 00:26:10,700
whatever you're close to in your life
though,

632
00:26:10,701 --> 00:26:12,740
she's accustomed to people giving her a
hard time.

633
00:26:13,010 --> 00:26:15,410
Know she didn't like it.
She went with him,

634
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:15,970
so I'm,
I'm,

635
00:26:15,970 --> 00:26:17,990
I'm,
we're trying to balance it out,

636
00:26:18,020 --> 00:26:19,280
you know,
there's got to be compromised.

637
00:26:19,281 --> 00:26:20,420
You got to meet,
you know what I mean?

638
00:26:20,450 --> 00:26:23,600
If she's here and you're here,
you got to go into this ever is when you

639
00:26:23,601 --> 00:26:27,230
just start dating someone and you go on
a vacation with them and it goes sour

640
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:32,510
and you're stuck with them for like five
days in some spot and it usually happens

641
00:26:32,511 --> 00:26:36,440
by the way on the plane ride over.
There's something that happens on the

642
00:26:36,441 --> 00:26:38,300
plane where you're like,
oh,

643
00:26:38,750 --> 00:26:43,170
I don't like you and we're going to be
on this plane for six more hours and

644
00:26:43,171 --> 00:26:44,390
then you know,
you're going to get to this hotel.

645
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:44,851
I mean,
yes.

646
00:26:44,851 --> 00:26:47,010
What you have to be compatible with
somebody before you travel.

647
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:48,780
Make.
Oh yeah.

648
00:26:48,781 --> 00:26:49,680
You have to make sure,
like,

649
00:26:49,710 --> 00:26:53,550
think even things like I like,
I want to go out and do things.

650
00:26:53,820 --> 00:26:57,150
Maybe if you're outdoorsy person and you
want to like leave the hotel or maybe

651
00:26:57,151 --> 00:26:59,310
you're not,
maybe you're a person that wants to take

652
00:26:59,311 --> 00:27:02,310
advantage of everything in the hotel or
you're on vacation and you want to

653
00:27:02,311 --> 00:27:04,580
chill.
That has to be established or you're

654
00:27:04,590 --> 00:27:05,940
going to be in a situation where you're
like,

655
00:27:06,090 --> 00:27:09,240
what do we still do it in the hotel or
the other person's like,

656
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:11,880
I don't want to go.
Why are we going out?

657
00:27:11,940 --> 00:27:16,940
I like Migraine and the
Migraine and so and then fall asleep and

658
00:27:18,361 --> 00:27:21,210
you hear the way we survived though.
We survived it.

659
00:27:21,420 --> 00:27:23,190
You know we made you change your phone
though.

660
00:27:23,260 --> 00:27:23,940
Was fucked up.

661
00:27:23,940 --> 00:27:25,770
I know that was the cops.
Soon as it's over.

662
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:30,390
Well,
so back to say I'm going to be the

663
00:27:30,391 --> 00:27:31,224
Andrea.
Yeah.

664
00:27:31,560 --> 00:27:32,940
I don't know.
I don't know if it's going to be over.

665
00:27:32,941 --> 00:27:34,320
We're coming up on a year.
Who?

666
00:27:34,360 --> 00:27:35,130
Shit?
Yeah.

667
00:27:35,130 --> 00:27:36,170
We're coming up on A.
Yeah,

668
00:27:36,570 --> 00:27:38,700
but I hear people.
You know what it is is people like you.

669
00:27:38,701 --> 00:27:40,500
It's your fucking fault.
He can work.

670
00:27:40,560 --> 00:27:45,560
You're on stage talking about your great
family and you want a family and how you

671
00:27:45,631 --> 00:27:46,441
deal with it.
Yeah.

672
00:27:46,441 --> 00:27:47,730
You think about these things,
man.

673
00:27:47,790 --> 00:27:49,380
How old do you know?
I'm 46.

674
00:27:49,740 --> 00:27:51,780
So thinking about shooting live ones in
there and make them.

675
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:53,220
I'm thinking about like,
you know what?

676
00:27:53,221 --> 00:27:55,190
Maybe it's time.
You know what it is is like once I,

677
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:57,210
I've,
I'm not super successful,

678
00:27:57,211 --> 00:27:59,700
but I've enjoyed my career and now I'm
like,

679
00:27:59,730 --> 00:28:00,720
oh,
I enjoy this.

680
00:28:00,721 --> 00:28:03,890
I'm going to share this with someone
that really cares about me and I.

681
00:28:03,890 --> 00:28:05,250
and one thing I'll say for a,
she,

682
00:28:05,280 --> 00:28:07,160
she,
I feel the love you.

683
00:28:07,310 --> 00:28:08,101
That's awesome.
Yeah,

684
00:28:08,101 --> 00:28:10,170
I really do feel the love.
She's a very loving woman,

685
00:28:10,171 --> 00:28:13,700
a very beautiful.
And so she got used to you after awhile

686
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:17,140
and understands your jokingness and
appreciates you coming.

687
00:28:17,210 --> 00:28:18,990
You're a good guy.
I'll tell you something that she did

688
00:28:18,991 --> 00:28:20,940
that.
This is why I'm even talking about her

689
00:28:20,941 --> 00:28:22,650
right now.
So she moved me.

690
00:28:22,710 --> 00:28:26,220
Joe The other day we were having a like
a little fight,

691
00:28:26,420 --> 00:28:29,340
low fi,
a little fight and then it was obviously

692
00:28:29,341 --> 00:28:31,050
I was like,
we're not communicating.

693
00:28:31,051 --> 00:28:32,610
I told her,
you know what she did,

694
00:28:32,760 --> 00:28:37,760
she downloaded communicating with your
man audio book and she and we sat and

695
00:28:38,851 --> 00:28:43,851
listened to it together and it was like,
that's why I quit when checking,

696
00:28:43,980 --> 00:28:46,890
check this check.
That changed my phone number through my

697
00:28:46,891 --> 00:28:48,870
phone in the ocean.
Like it was like,

698
00:28:49,140 --> 00:28:53,160
it was like the guy that wrote the book
was talking about her.

699
00:28:55,580 --> 00:28:57,090
That was the best part about it.
He was like,

700
00:28:57,390 --> 00:28:59,090
it would be like something like,
you know,

701
00:28:59,100 --> 00:29:02,580
what you shouldn't do with your man is
don't have a look on your face of

702
00:29:02,581 --> 00:29:04,590
disgust when you,
when you're mad.

703
00:29:04,770 --> 00:29:07,890
It was like all these things.
And then there was one moment I'm going

704
00:29:07,891 --> 00:29:09,510
like this.
I had my hands in the air and it was

705
00:29:09,511 --> 00:29:11,310
like,
if your man's body language,

706
00:29:11,340 --> 00:29:15,960
if he has his hands,
that's your time to back off.

707
00:29:15,961 --> 00:29:18,360
And I was like this,
did you date this guy because he's

708
00:29:18,361 --> 00:29:19,950
talking about you right now.
You know what I mean?

709
00:29:20,250 --> 00:29:22,800
But I thought that the gesture of being
like,

710
00:29:22,801 --> 00:29:24,240
Hey,
I need to improve.

711
00:29:24,540 --> 00:29:28,440
I need to like change how I feel or,
or like,

712
00:29:28,620 --> 00:29:31,150
you know,
maybe look at a self self reflect that,

713
00:29:31,500 --> 00:29:35,520
the act of that self reflection with her
that that was,

714
00:29:35,610 --> 00:29:38,940
that's big speak volumes for her and her
character and it really made me go,

715
00:29:38,941 --> 00:29:40,020
okay,
you really want to,

716
00:29:40,590 --> 00:29:42,640
you want to make this work and that's
awesome.

717
00:29:42,670 --> 00:29:43,540
Yeah.
So I said,

718
00:29:43,541 --> 00:29:44,470
okay,
I want to make it work.

719
00:29:44,471 --> 00:29:45,880
How old is she?
Twenty nine.

720
00:29:46,120 --> 00:29:46,953
Oh,
okay.

721
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:48,860
Yeah.
So she's at that age,

722
00:29:48,940 --> 00:29:49,930
should not have said that.
I know.

723
00:29:49,931 --> 00:29:51,100
That's good.
So much trouble.

724
00:29:51,130 --> 00:29:54,220
Why not supposed to tell?
I'm not supposed to tell her like she,

725
00:29:54,250 --> 00:29:55,410
she want.
Oh God.

726
00:29:55,720 --> 00:29:59,900
Well the cat's out the bag now.
So fucking write their name.

727
00:30:00,890 --> 00:30:02,710
Just go to my instagram.
You're going to say,

728
00:30:02,890 --> 00:30:04,780
oh my God,
I'm so sorry.

729
00:30:07,160 --> 00:30:07,900
I know.
I know,

730
00:30:07,900 --> 00:30:09,460
but that's part of the problem,
you know what I mean?

731
00:30:09,461 --> 00:30:09,821
But.
No,

732
00:30:09,821 --> 00:30:12,670
but she know because she,
she doesn't want people to know.

733
00:30:13,170 --> 00:30:14,710
So she wants,
she wants people to know.

734
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:16,410
She thinks she's 23.
So I.

735
00:30:16,690 --> 00:30:17,620
So I said,
hey,

736
00:30:17,860 --> 00:30:19,900
that,
that makes me look like a creeper

737
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,990
creeper.
And even this age difference is a little

738
00:30:23,020 --> 00:30:23,920
Iffy,
right?

739
00:30:24,300 --> 00:30:29,300
So like it's weird how we just make
rules as to how old someone can be to be

740
00:30:30,911 --> 00:30:33,280
with someone else.
But it changes after a while.

741
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:33,821
Right?
Like,

742
00:30:33,821 --> 00:30:35,470
once you get,
like,

743
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:39,490
if the dude is like this guy,
he and the woman's 50,

744
00:30:39,491 --> 00:30:41,230
we don't go give a fuck,
whatever.

745
00:30:41,300 --> 00:30:41,630
No,
no,

746
00:30:41,630 --> 00:30:42,463
no,
no.

747
00:30:42,790 --> 00:30:45,670
I would say to me it's like it's gotta
be 30,

748
00:30:46,140 --> 00:30:47,620
like you know,
like she's at the cusp of it.

749
00:30:47,621 --> 00:30:49,870
I think like once a woman gets to like
28,

750
00:30:49,871 --> 00:30:51,430
29,
30 in that age range,

751
00:30:51,670 --> 00:30:54,490
then this other part,
it doesn't matter it depending on what

752
00:30:54,491 --> 00:30:55,720
they got going on in their life.

753
00:30:55,870 --> 00:30:59,170
But it's not about the age,
it's about experience level.

754
00:30:59,230 --> 00:31:01,370
It's about where are you in your life.
So at the moment,

755
00:31:01,410 --> 00:31:03,160
one thing I struggle with is that like,
look,

756
00:31:03,161 --> 00:31:06,580
I'm knee deep in my career when I
remember when I was 30,

757
00:31:06,760 --> 00:31:08,020
I wasn't doing this.
I was,

758
00:31:08,380 --> 00:31:09,940
I just started.
You were hustling.

759
00:31:09,970 --> 00:31:11,500
I was hustling.
So I go,

760
00:31:11,530 --> 00:31:13,900
I have to remember that this is her
hustle years.

761
00:31:14,110 --> 00:31:15,730
So you started doing standup at 30?
Yeah,

762
00:31:15,740 --> 00:31:16,220
yeah,
yeah.

763
00:31:16,220 --> 00:31:18,310
I took a late start,
right?

764
00:31:18,520 --> 00:31:22,210
I started,
I went to a comedy class when I was in

765
00:31:22,211 --> 00:31:24,790
my early twenties because my mom,
one of those supportive women.

766
00:31:24,791 --> 00:31:25,530
I said,
hey mom,

767
00:31:25,530 --> 00:31:27,790
I think I want to be a comedian next
day.

768
00:31:28,270 --> 00:31:31,750
I'm signed up at La at Ucla extension,
you know,

769
00:31:32,140 --> 00:31:33,400
with a notebook.
And she's like,

770
00:31:33,770 --> 00:31:34,571
yeah,
that's all my mom.

771
00:31:34,571 --> 00:31:37,250
If I said I want to be a rock,
if I said I want to be a rock climber.

772
00:31:37,251 --> 00:31:38,320
And my mom was like,
okay.

773
00:31:38,470 --> 00:31:40,300
She goes,
she would've bought ropes and like hook

774
00:31:40,301 --> 00:31:42,340
me up with the because you want to be
out of the fucking house,

775
00:31:42,341 --> 00:31:44,230
you know,
like when I was young,

776
00:31:44,231 --> 00:31:47,350
you know.
So I went to the class taught by sandy

777
00:31:47,351 --> 00:31:48,370
shore.
Oh,

778
00:31:48,371 --> 00:31:48,931
Jesus.
Yeah.

779
00:31:48,931 --> 00:31:49,764
Yeah.
It was,

780
00:31:50,710 --> 00:31:51,970
I thought it.
I thought this is going to be it.

781
00:31:52,060 --> 00:31:53,590
Her mom,
daughter,

782
00:31:53,620 --> 00:31:55,930
her mom owns the comedy store.
I'm going to make it.

783
00:31:56,180 --> 00:31:59,860
That was the advice.
Look at you.

784
00:31:59,950 --> 00:32:02,650
Wow.
This,

785
00:32:03,390 --> 00:32:04,930
this motherfucker right here.

786
00:32:07,150 --> 00:32:08,860
Joe Rogan tried to start.
She's me.

787
00:32:08,861 --> 00:32:12,880
How good was the advice?
I misspoke.

788
00:32:12,890 --> 00:32:14,290
And I can't tell you this,
this is,

789
00:32:14,350 --> 00:32:14,950
I really,
I,

790
00:32:14,950 --> 00:32:15,510
I,
I,

791
00:32:15,510 --> 00:32:18,940
I need it.
I suggest to anyone if you want to be a

792
00:32:18,941 --> 00:32:21,850
comic,
go to one comedy class just for the

793
00:32:21,851 --> 00:32:25,360
comfort of the environment and the
support to go to one comedy class.

794
00:32:25,361 --> 00:32:27,700
But after that you got to get out there
into the open mics and you got to do it

795
00:32:27,701 --> 00:32:30,360
on your own.
But I suggest one comedy class.

796
00:32:30,380 --> 00:32:31,870
All right.
There's nothing wrong with it.

797
00:32:31,960 --> 00:32:35,320
So I went and I loved that.
And then by the way,

798
00:32:35,590 --> 00:32:39,230
the Od,
the showcase for the graduation was at

799
00:32:39,231 --> 00:32:42,650
the comedy store in the or.
So the first time I ever did standup

800
00:32:42,651 --> 00:32:45,970
comedy within the or at the comedy store
was this,

801
00:32:46,340 --> 00:32:51,340
it was like 90 something to 93.
And you know what I remember

802
00:32:51,561 --> 00:32:53,450
specifically,
it was like after our show,

803
00:32:53,451 --> 00:32:57,670
they just rolled into the,
our show first got onstage Carlos

804
00:32:57,670 --> 00:32:57,830
Mitzia.

805
00:32:57,830 --> 00:33:00,380
Wow.
And he goes on and at the time he was

806
00:33:00,381 --> 00:33:01,214
like,
you know,

807
00:33:01,430 --> 00:33:02,490
Oh,
you know,

808
00:33:04,260 --> 00:33:08,480
just at that
time he was like,

809
00:33:08,510 --> 00:33:11,930
Taco Bell.
That is fucking hilarious.

810
00:33:11,931 --> 00:33:14,030
I remember watching him and I'm at the
time,

811
00:33:14,300 --> 00:33:15,950
at the time,
I remember watching him thinking,

812
00:33:16,040 --> 00:33:18,200
I think I can do this,
you know,

813
00:33:18,350 --> 00:33:20,930
because I had a great set.
I had a great first set,

814
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:22,940
you know,
you know how that goes and supportive

815
00:33:22,941 --> 00:33:23,960
people in the crowd.
And um,

816
00:33:24,280 --> 00:33:26,510
you know,
I have my funny hacky jokes that I was

817
00:33:26,511 --> 00:33:29,000
doing at the time.
Just my knew what I thought was new.

818
00:33:29,240 --> 00:33:31,250
I remember one of my jokes was like,
I was like,

819
00:33:31,280 --> 00:33:34,370
how come you can't recognize superman?
And then I would take my glasses off,

820
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:36,140
you know,
like I'd be like,

821
00:33:36,170 --> 00:33:37,010
look,
I'm Clark Kent,

822
00:33:37,070 --> 00:33:38,340
take them off man.
You know,

823
00:33:38,350 --> 00:33:40,040
that was like,
I thought that was hilarious at the

824
00:33:40,041 --> 00:33:40,874
time.

825
00:33:41,170 --> 00:33:43,160
Um,
no black people on jeopardy.

826
00:33:43,161 --> 00:33:44,870
That was another one of my jokes.
That's a good one.

827
00:33:44,930 --> 00:33:47,120
Yeah.
So I had like a had black categories on

828
00:33:47,121 --> 00:33:47,800
jeopardy already,
you know,

829
00:33:47,800 --> 00:33:49,970
blind singers,
barbecue holidays,

830
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:50,833
you know,
I had,

831
00:33:51,390 --> 00:33:53,160
I was killing back then with that shit,
man.

832
00:33:53,520 --> 00:33:57,740
So brutal though.
When you go to a real show with that

833
00:33:57,741 --> 00:34:00,440
shit and it's crickets,
but you're like,

834
00:34:00,441 --> 00:34:02,480
but an open mic night.
It's weird,

835
00:34:02,481 --> 00:34:04,520
right?
Like there's open mic night material

836
00:34:04,610 --> 00:34:07,610
where it does okay on open mic nights
and you're like,

837
00:34:07,611 --> 00:34:09,710
this is some good material.
I just got to develop it.

838
00:34:09,770 --> 00:34:13,460
I don't even think it's even open mic.
I think even worse is doing it in front

839
00:34:13,461 --> 00:34:14,630
of a crowd,
you know,

840
00:34:14,690 --> 00:34:16,510
this is what happens to get side
tracked,

841
00:34:16,520 --> 00:34:17,570
but I love it.
You know when you're.

842
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:19,910
When you go in the Middle American when
you first were coming up when you were

843
00:34:19,911 --> 00:34:23,660
still a major headliner and then like
the local guy will be there that local

844
00:34:23,661 --> 00:34:28,550
guys now going to be on Joe Rogan's show
in Iowa and he's going to be performing

845
00:34:28,551 --> 00:34:30,230
in front of two or 300 people.

846
00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:32,660
Right?
That type of hacky material is going to

847
00:34:32,661 --> 00:34:36,590
kill with those people.
Then then that person now thinks that

848
00:34:36,591 --> 00:34:40,730
this is how you do it and they bring
that to La and New York and then they're

849
00:34:40,731 --> 00:34:41,870
like,
oh,

850
00:34:41,960 --> 00:34:44,960
how come this isn't working?
And then they're seeing like a thousand

851
00:34:44,961 --> 00:34:47,640
other comics doing,
you know,

852
00:34:47,720 --> 00:34:51,140
talking about the same subjects and then
they don't realize how they had to find

853
00:34:51,141 --> 00:34:52,700
some originality.
And what they're doing,

854
00:34:53,160 --> 00:34:55,730
and that's the hard part.
That's the hard part.

855
00:34:55,850 --> 00:34:57,500
We,
there's not a lot of subjects to talk

856
00:34:57,501 --> 00:34:58,640
about,
you know,

857
00:34:58,670 --> 00:35:00,980
you're not the first comment to get
married and have daughters.

858
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:05,030
Right.
But this experience that you had is,

859
00:35:05,130 --> 00:35:09,650
is it is personal to you and conveying
that is the hard part,

860
00:35:09,860 --> 00:35:10,850
right?
You know,

861
00:35:10,851 --> 00:35:13,340
and so people kind of go just surface
which are material.

862
00:35:13,580 --> 00:35:17,990
It's hard to delve deeper and it's hard.
It's hard to have the confidence to drag

863
00:35:18,020 --> 00:35:19,310
a subject out too.

864
00:35:19,670 --> 00:35:23,870
Like when you first start out like you,
your premises are so short and then you

865
00:35:23,871 --> 00:35:27,050
go from one short premise to another
short premise and then it becomes a,

866
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:30,200
it becomes a bit,
the bit becomes a,

867
00:35:30,201 --> 00:35:32,390
you know,
a set then.

868
00:35:32,391 --> 00:35:37,010
And then now you're talking about often
tell comics like that.

869
00:35:37,620 --> 00:35:39,240
It's like music,
you know,

870
00:35:39,420 --> 00:35:40,380
if you heard,
uh,

871
00:35:40,740 --> 00:35:44,640
if you heard like a Neptune's beat,
you can hear it from a mile away.

872
00:35:44,970 --> 00:35:47,250
You can know when you hear it you go,
Oh,

873
00:35:47,251 --> 00:35:50,160
I bet you the neptunes produce that
track.

874
00:35:50,780 --> 00:35:51,960
Or,
or premier,

875
00:35:52,020 --> 00:35:53,070
you know,
the Dj Premier,

876
00:35:53,460 --> 00:35:54,660
he would produce a beat and you'd be
like,

877
00:35:54,661 --> 00:35:55,740
oh,
that's a premier beat.

878
00:35:56,130 --> 00:35:59,370
Your comic.
Your comedy is the same way when you're

879
00:35:59,700 --> 00:36:03,600
working on things.
You work on it in your way that if you

880
00:36:03,601 --> 00:36:07,800
looked at all your material,
you might now see the common thread and

881
00:36:07,801 --> 00:36:09,780
that's how you put together an act.

882
00:36:10,500 --> 00:36:11,640
Thirty minutes,
40 minutes.

883
00:36:11,641 --> 00:36:15,090
That's how you're able to talk about a
subject for so long because we've now

884
00:36:15,091 --> 00:36:18,030
woven together these thoughts that we
don't think are connected,

885
00:36:18,060 --> 00:36:19,110
but when we look at them,
you go,

886
00:36:19,140 --> 00:36:20,190
oh,
which I'm actually.

887
00:36:20,700 --> 00:36:25,420
This subject actually flows into this
and it connects very nicely so that

888
00:36:25,620 --> 00:36:28,290
that's what was going on.
So I'm watching again.

889
00:36:28,291 --> 00:36:32,520
I'm watching Lexia at the time.
I'm just a young kid.

890
00:36:32,521 --> 00:36:35,970
I don't know what to do next.
I just had a great set I thought,

891
00:36:36,310 --> 00:36:38,940
and now I'm looking at these
professionals and I saw them and see it

892
00:36:38,941 --> 00:36:42,900
and at that particular time I was like,
I saw him and when he talked about Taco

893
00:36:42,901 --> 00:36:43,830
bell and stuff,
I thought,

894
00:36:44,150 --> 00:36:45,600
you know,
I think I could do this.

895
00:36:45,840 --> 00:36:50,430
You know,
and then he brought up Chris Tucker and

896
00:36:50,750 --> 00:36:53,370
Chris Tucker went on stage and I was
thought to myself,

897
00:36:53,430 --> 00:36:55,830
I don't think I could do this just the
way he was.

898
00:36:55,830 --> 00:36:58,230
So like,
what is voice man?

899
00:36:58,231 --> 00:37:01,050
You know,
just just Taco tacos on fire back then.

900
00:37:01,051 --> 00:37:01,680
Yeah,
just uh,

901
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:04,470
his whole persona and I thought I didn't
know and I didn't know what to do.

902
00:37:04,710 --> 00:37:06,860
So I floundered around.
I did open minded.

903
00:37:06,861 --> 00:37:08,420
You get nervous when you saw Chris
Tucker?

904
00:37:08,450 --> 00:37:11,250
I do so powerful.
It was just so it was something special

905
00:37:11,251 --> 00:37:13,260
about what he was doing and I just
thought,

906
00:37:13,261 --> 00:37:16,560
I don't know if I don't.
I just was scattered to habit at that

907
00:37:16,561 --> 00:37:17,131
time,
man.

908
00:37:17,131 --> 00:37:21,780
I was so nervous and scared and arrogant
too because I was a funny guy.

909
00:37:21,990 --> 00:37:26,040
So then I would go to open mics and then
the same people doing the same shit over

910
00:37:26,041 --> 00:37:28,470
and over and over again.
Then I wouldn't go to another open mic

911
00:37:28,471 --> 00:37:30,870
for another four weeks and then I see
the same people and I thought,

912
00:37:30,871 --> 00:37:32,430
well,
how do you get from here?

913
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:33,900
How do you get on the,
you know,

914
00:37:33,901 --> 00:37:36,240
this and know it and I didn't know.
There was no mentors,

915
00:37:36,630 --> 00:37:38,730
there was no people going like,
let me help you with this.

916
00:37:39,050 --> 00:37:41,070
You know,
you couldn't even talk to someone of

917
00:37:41,071 --> 00:37:42,150
your stature at all.
Like,

918
00:37:42,151 --> 00:37:43,500
you know,
at the time you couldn't just be some

919
00:37:43,501 --> 00:37:45,540
open micro and I,
by the way,

920
00:37:45,541 --> 00:37:47,310
they shouldn't do that.
You know what I mean?

921
00:37:47,730 --> 00:37:49,440
Like you know,
you don't need the comedy store and some

922
00:37:49,441 --> 00:37:51,060
dude comes up to you.
You're just kinda like,

923
00:37:51,090 --> 00:37:52,440
what do you want to talk to me about
right now?

924
00:37:52,441 --> 00:37:57,441
Dude.
Like you just started kyle approach I

925
00:37:57,841 --> 00:38:00,120
think especially when they worked there
as door guys.

926
00:38:00,210 --> 00:38:03,180
I feel like everybody's just a comic
that's different,

927
00:38:03,780 --> 00:38:05,200
that's different.
But like there's,

928
00:38:05,201 --> 00:38:08,310
there's a sorta but even still like it's
like,

929
00:38:08,670 --> 00:38:12,090
I don't know if it's so appropriate for
a door guy to come up to you and be

930
00:38:12,091 --> 00:38:12,691
like,
Yo,

931
00:38:12,691 --> 00:38:14,400
can I open for you at Irvine?

932
00:38:14,790 --> 00:38:16,740
You know,
some guy just did that the other day.

933
00:38:17,230 --> 00:38:18,140
Mitch,
I don't know you.

934
00:38:18,150 --> 00:38:19,700
I don't know.
You know,

935
00:38:19,910 --> 00:38:22,260
I have friends by the way.
I used to do that.

936
00:38:22,790 --> 00:38:23,380
They show.
Yeah,

937
00:38:23,380 --> 00:38:24,550
I used to do that.
I remember John,

938
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:25,660
Johnny Sanchez.
Sure.

939
00:38:26,010 --> 00:38:27,390
First was coming up.
I went to Johnson.

940
00:38:27,391 --> 00:38:28,410
Johnny,
let me open for you.

941
00:38:28,470 --> 00:38:31,710
I'm a jug or not.
Is that what you said?

942
00:38:31,950 --> 00:38:35,290
I told them I was agenda.
I said I'm trying to bury these

943
00:38:35,291 --> 00:38:36,160
headliners,
man.

944
00:38:36,161 --> 00:38:38,590
That's what I was trying to.
I thought that's what she told him.

945
00:38:38,650 --> 00:38:39,760
Yeah,
that's what you thought you were

946
00:38:39,950 --> 00:38:41,590
supposed to do.
I was like checking his watch.

947
00:38:41,620 --> 00:38:42,453
Oh,
look at the time.

948
00:38:44,230 --> 00:38:46,360
So He's,
he's teased me ever since.

949
00:38:46,361 --> 00:38:49,030
This is a 22 year old,
15 years later he still teases me about

950
00:38:49,031 --> 00:38:50,410
it.
But um,

951
00:38:50,530 --> 00:38:51,210
you know,
so I,

952
00:38:51,210 --> 00:38:52,870
I didn't know.
I didn't know what I was doing,

953
00:38:52,920 --> 00:38:54,100
you know,
I didn't know how to.

954
00:38:54,870 --> 00:38:55,870
Well,
what are you supposed to do,

955
00:38:55,871 --> 00:38:57,160
man?
Now there's no clear path.

956
00:38:57,161 --> 00:38:59,890
It's not just being a doctor.
There's no right or wrong way either,

957
00:38:59,950 --> 00:39:00,783
you know?
I didn't know.

958
00:39:00,840 --> 00:39:03,190
It's true too.
Especially I grew up in La.

959
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:06,340
I was born and raised in La,
so I'm in La trying to get on a stage

960
00:39:06,341 --> 00:39:08,950
where I would go to the law.
Like I was telling you earlier,

961
00:39:08,951 --> 00:39:12,880
I saw you at the laugh factory with
hair,

962
00:39:13,240 --> 00:39:16,540
you know,
and just like a man you were on stage,

963
00:39:16,600 --> 00:39:20,200
like I'm not like you were just given
it.

964
00:39:21,610 --> 00:39:24,160
There's a certain energy you had about
what you were talking about that I was

965
00:39:24,161 --> 00:39:24,760
like,
damn,

966
00:39:24,760 --> 00:39:29,760
what happened to this guy?
Like I remember the first thought,

967
00:39:29,801 --> 00:39:30,401
I was like,
man,

968
00:39:30,401 --> 00:39:35,401
some woman hurt him
and I thought,

969
00:39:36,160 --> 00:39:37,750
I don't know if I've tapped into that
yet.

970
00:39:37,751 --> 00:39:39,850
I thought at the time,
I don't know if I've tapped into that.

971
00:39:40,150 --> 00:39:42,070
So it took a long time for me to
realize,

972
00:39:42,100 --> 00:39:43,240
oh no,
this is what I want to do.

973
00:39:43,241 --> 00:39:45,760
And like when I was 13,
he's different,

974
00:39:45,761 --> 00:39:47,170
you know,
like some people go up there and they're

975
00:39:47,171 --> 00:39:50,950
excited and angry about shit and some
people go up there and they're mellow.

976
00:39:50,951 --> 00:39:55,951
And that's the funny part is the slow,
low punchlines,

977
00:39:58,361 --> 00:40:01,810
you know.
But even if you like sigora perfect

978
00:40:01,850 --> 00:40:04,030
exact,
just could tell a story.

979
00:40:04,270 --> 00:40:05,370
Have you captivated?
Yeah,

980
00:40:05,380 --> 00:40:07,080
there's no anger,
there's no,

981
00:40:07,110 --> 00:40:08,960
no,
like screaming emotions.

982
00:40:08,961 --> 00:40:11,620
Cigarettes just chill out.
But don't you find yourself?

983
00:40:11,670 --> 00:40:12,880
Have you ever gone,
gone up?

984
00:40:12,881 --> 00:40:14,470
It had been in because you have a way of
performing,

985
00:40:14,471 --> 00:40:15,940
like you know you have a,
you know,

986
00:40:15,941 --> 00:40:17,200
as Joe Mode,
you know,

987
00:40:17,530 --> 00:40:20,580
you're on there,
it's going to be powerful and you're

988
00:40:20,581 --> 00:40:24,130
gonna you're like really?
And then have you ever just gone on and

989
00:40:24,250 --> 00:40:27,490
Kinda like not done it that way,
but then now you get laughed at a

990
00:40:27,491 --> 00:40:31,750
completely different point and you're
set with new material for sure because

991
00:40:31,751 --> 00:40:33,320
you're trying to find the,
you know,

992
00:40:33,370 --> 00:40:34,470
you trying to find the beats.

993
00:40:34,470 --> 00:40:35,230
I,
I,

994
00:40:35,230 --> 00:40:40,180
I set material up to fail sometimes,
like I'll go into a bit slower and I'll

995
00:40:40,181 --> 00:40:44,920
go and do a bit more casual and try to
ramp it up rather than try to make it

996
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:48,610
like sometimes when you get a new bit,
especially when you first started out

997
00:40:48,630 --> 00:40:51,250
like this bit is shaky,
let me just get it out of the gate with

998
00:40:51,251 --> 00:40:53,890
a lot of momentum so that I can kind of
coast with it.

999
00:40:54,420 --> 00:40:55,630
Sometimes I'll,
I'll say,

1000
00:40:55,631 --> 00:40:57,490
all right,
well this bit might be all just bullshit

1001
00:40:57,491 --> 00:41:00,130
or what Tom Calls Thompson [inaudible]
calls them dance moves.

1002
00:41:01,240 --> 00:41:05,080
I used to call it English,
English on the cue ball because

1003
00:41:05,081 --> 00:41:07,720
sometimes you're just,
you're hamming it up,

1004
00:41:08,080 --> 00:41:09,880
you're doing that.
What you're saying,

1005
00:41:09,881 --> 00:41:11,200
you doing that thing that you do that.
No.

1006
00:41:11,210 --> 00:41:13,590
Makes people laugh and it's really
difficult,

1007
00:41:13,591 --> 00:41:15,730
isn't it?
It's really difficult for me because I'm

1008
00:41:15,731 --> 00:41:17,650
just a funny looking guy,
you know?

1009
00:41:17,960 --> 00:41:19,110
I mean,
I accepted it,

1010
00:41:19,190 --> 00:41:19,880
you know,
I'm not,

1011
00:41:19,880 --> 00:41:21,220
I'm not a looker,
you know what I mean?

1012
00:41:21,450 --> 00:41:22,630
I'm cute.
You know what I'm saying?

1013
00:41:22,640 --> 00:41:25,910
I had some felony guy mustache works
with,

1014
00:41:25,911 --> 00:41:27,430
you know my qualities.
Right.

1015
00:41:27,640 --> 00:41:30,930
But I know that like that I could do a
thing that they're thinking,

1016
00:41:30,940 --> 00:41:32,740
why are they laughing at what I'm
talking about?

1017
00:41:32,741 --> 00:41:36,230
Like are they with me emotionally?
Are they with me intellectually or are

1018
00:41:36,231 --> 00:41:37,070
they just going like,
oh,

1019
00:41:37,071 --> 00:41:40,790
this guy is funny and it's hard to
recognize that.

1020
00:41:41,720 --> 00:41:42,620
Yeah.
Right.

1021
00:41:42,621 --> 00:41:43,940
Like,
what do you want from them?

1022
00:41:43,970 --> 00:41:45,980
Do you want to.
Do you want to connect with them?

1023
00:41:45,981 --> 00:41:49,550
Do you want them to laugh?
Do you want both or do you want them to

1024
00:41:49,551 --> 00:41:51,110
appreciate you,
they just,

1025
00:41:51,140 --> 00:41:54,830
you just want them to have a good time
or do you even want them to laugh at how

1026
00:41:54,831 --> 00:41:56,780
you are connected to what you're talking
about?

1027
00:41:57,320 --> 00:42:00,500
Because that's different too.
Like if you're a political comic,

1028
00:42:00,501 --> 00:42:03,920
people might laugh that like how
passionate you are about being a

1029
00:42:03,921 --> 00:42:08,000
libertarian or how passionate you are
about being an atheist.

1030
00:42:08,390 --> 00:42:11,000
Maybe they don't agree with you or maybe
they do agree with you,

1031
00:42:11,001 --> 00:42:14,210
but they just,
they're laughing at how you are

1032
00:42:14,211 --> 00:42:17,180
connected to what you're saying.
And I think that that's another element

1033
00:42:17,240 --> 00:42:18,590
that's.
And that's a whole other thing.

1034
00:42:18,940 --> 00:42:20,720
You know,
I look at all my friends,

1035
00:42:20,721 --> 00:42:21,280
uh,
you know,

1036
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:23,420
we have a lot of peers or friends that
we just go,

1037
00:42:23,570 --> 00:42:26,000
like,
they all have something different in

1038
00:42:26,001 --> 00:42:27,030
that way.
Yeah.

1039
00:42:27,090 --> 00:42:28,420
You know,
in the summer it's an,

1040
00:42:28,460 --> 00:42:32,150
it's an amazing thing to watch.
It's a crazy art form because nobody can

1041
00:42:32,151 --> 00:42:34,640
tell you how to do it.
Sounded like any other art form.

1042
00:42:34,820 --> 00:42:37,370
Yeah.
It really know like if you went into

1043
00:42:37,371 --> 00:42:39,380
music or I went into music like we
could,

1044
00:42:39,410 --> 00:42:42,790
like you can be in a rock band or you
could be in a blues band or you get like

1045
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:45,440
country music and everybody would be
clearly defined,

1046
00:42:45,800 --> 00:42:46,850
but you just do standup.

1047
00:42:47,240 --> 00:42:48,620
Yeah.
It's just standup.

1048
00:42:48,950 --> 00:42:50,750
I mean there's no,
there's no categories.

1049
00:42:50,810 --> 00:42:53,330
What was funny about that though is I
know that there's no categories,

1050
00:42:53,331 --> 00:42:57,500
but I do think that it is similar to
music in that we're not going to change

1051
00:42:57,501 --> 00:43:01,400
the rules of communication and I think
that's where people get in the way.

1052
00:43:01,700 --> 00:43:04,670
So like when you're on a piano,
you're not going to make new cords.

1053
00:43:04,820 --> 00:43:05,880
It's still going to be a,
b,

1054
00:43:05,881 --> 00:43:06,350
c,
d,

1055
00:43:06,350 --> 00:43:07,460
g,
you know what I mean?

1056
00:43:07,700 --> 00:43:11,930
And like the certain courts when they go
together or not gonna sound good no

1057
00:43:11,931 --> 00:43:13,820
matter what,
you're not going to reinvent the wheel.

1058
00:43:14,060 --> 00:43:17,660
So I think the baseline of comedy is
like just being able to communicate your

1059
00:43:17,661 --> 00:43:20,960
points and I think one of your,
a person that can communicate your

1060
00:43:20,961 --> 00:43:25,961
points and they're solid and clear.
Then the jokes on top of that or going

1061
00:43:27,580 --> 00:43:29,630
to what the entertainment is going to
be,

1062
00:43:29,840 --> 00:43:31,130
but you know,
you still got to like you don't want

1063
00:43:31,131 --> 00:43:33,860
somebody says they're telling the story
and nobody says anything and then they

1064
00:43:33,861 --> 00:43:34,431
go,
well,

1065
00:43:34,431 --> 00:43:35,390
you know you had to be there.

1066
00:43:35,540 --> 00:43:38,050
Well that's a horrible storyteller.
That's,

1067
00:43:38,051 --> 00:43:41,300
that's what that is.
You'll never hear Joey Dsa that never

1068
00:43:42,970 --> 00:43:47,870
be their cock sucker.
Like that would be like,

1069
00:43:47,871 --> 00:43:49,640
well I don't know if I want to be there
bro.

1070
00:43:49,670 --> 00:43:53,360
You know you had to be there means you
failed in communicating.

1071
00:43:53,540 --> 00:43:56,850
So I think that on that level,
even though all comics are different in

1072
00:43:56,870 --> 00:43:59,930
it's weird,
but that level of like long when.

1073
00:44:00,030 --> 00:44:02,030
So when you say setup,
that is important.

1074
00:44:02,031 --> 00:44:03,890
It's not going to be universal to all of
us.

1075
00:44:04,250 --> 00:44:05,990
You have to set this up.
Yeah.

1076
00:44:06,470 --> 00:44:09,440
That's the case with all songs and
everything too.

1077
00:44:09,441 --> 00:44:10,850
But their styles,
you know,

1078
00:44:10,851 --> 00:44:12,700
like there's certain styles of comedy.
Yeah.

1079
00:44:13,130 --> 00:44:17,710
I guess their styles of comedy so much.
There's no distinct style.

1080
00:44:17,760 --> 00:44:21,110
If you heard like
for example,

1081
00:44:21,111 --> 00:44:22,310
a Hank Williams Jr,
like,

1082
00:44:22,311 --> 00:44:24,710
well,
that's clearly country and you just hear

1083
00:44:24,711 --> 00:44:26,090
it,
you know right away you hear,

1084
00:44:26,560 --> 00:44:29,960
yeah,
there's some wacky about country.

1085
00:44:30,660 --> 00:44:33,060
There's something about the story.
I love country with a good story.

1086
00:44:33,090 --> 00:44:35,110
You know,
driving down a highway,

1087
00:44:35,111 --> 00:44:37,170
you know,
whatever you do is healing a couple of

1088
00:44:37,171 --> 00:44:39,360
words.
I know what the fuck this is.

1089
00:44:39,540 --> 00:44:43,950
Just to have like music behind it.
You know what he sat your comedy at the

1090
00:44:43,951 --> 00:44:47,310
time it was the country music of comedy.
I think you misrepresenting

1091
00:44:48,930 --> 00:44:51,540
never.
It was a story.

1092
00:44:51,600 --> 00:44:53,580
You know you,
you felt that the anguish.

1093
00:44:54,470 --> 00:44:55,880
I don't think that's what I was doing.

1094
00:44:57,920 --> 00:45:00,960
Are you trying to look back and think
weird though?

1095
00:45:00,961 --> 00:45:02,850
He had hair.
It was a whole different guy.

1096
00:45:03,140 --> 00:45:03,750
Yeah.
No,

1097
00:45:03,750 --> 00:45:06,540
you weren't this.
You're a solid muscle now.

1098
00:45:06,720 --> 00:45:09,390
Like I don't know if you have.
What's your body fat count right now?

1099
00:45:09,420 --> 00:45:11,130
I don't get it checked.
Okay.

1100
00:45:11,160 --> 00:45:13,410
That's probably better.
It's probably better to think that it's

1101
00:45:13,500 --> 00:45:17,100
better than it probably is.
I think if you went and you might be

1102
00:45:17,101 --> 00:45:19,680
disappointed.
The last time I checked it was 10

1103
00:45:19,681 --> 00:45:21,060
percent.
Oh my gosh.

1104
00:45:21,100 --> 00:45:23,640
Not very low.
I'm probably like 30 percent,

1105
00:45:23,641 --> 00:45:25,770
35 percent body fat.
That's crazy.

1106
00:45:25,800 --> 00:45:27,130
Yeah.
I got stumped in.

1107
00:45:27,620 --> 00:45:28,540
That's not good.
But I,

1108
00:45:28,541 --> 00:45:29,281
you know what it is.
I,

1109
00:45:29,281 --> 00:45:32,220
I my but my blood pressure's good.
That's good.

1110
00:45:32,490 --> 00:45:33,091
Yeah.
Because I,

1111
00:45:33,091 --> 00:45:33,550
you know,
I,

1112
00:45:33,550 --> 00:45:35,660
I told him you what I'm trying to box
man.

1113
00:45:35,690 --> 00:45:36,570
I'm working out.
I went to this,

1114
00:45:36,571 --> 00:45:39,690
I'm going to the boxing thing and it's
like I go to glove works,

1115
00:45:40,140 --> 00:45:42,360
works in century city and shit.

1116
00:45:43,780 --> 00:45:46,440
Yeah,
it's a pads holding,

1117
00:45:47,040 --> 00:45:49,350
holding the thing in.
And this something that tricks you with

1118
00:45:49,351 --> 00:45:51,810
that though,
because they hit them back.

1119
00:45:51,830 --> 00:45:53,230
Yeah.
So youth in um,

1120
00:45:53,550 --> 00:45:55,890
after I've done it a few times,
I'm walking around in public like,

1121
00:45:55,900 --> 00:45:56,733
Fucker,
I wish,

1122
00:45:58,110 --> 00:46:01,740
I wish somebody would test me like
they're going to hold up their hands and

1123
00:46:01,741 --> 00:46:04,100
fight me like this,
but you know,

1124
00:46:04,140 --> 00:46:07,620
what's something about going to boxing
is changed my perception of women,

1125
00:46:08,910 --> 00:46:13,910
women in the boxing thing.
Like they really at that shit is when

1126
00:46:13,921 --> 00:46:15,300
you see a,
you know,

1127
00:46:15,570 --> 00:46:18,960
I'm working out with five people and
then a woman goes in and he goes on,

1128
00:46:19,070 --> 00:46:20,150
you know,
and she's like,

1129
00:46:21,850 --> 00:46:23,100
I'm just like,
God damn,

1130
00:46:23,101 --> 00:46:25,890
this is good,
this is great.

1131
00:46:25,930 --> 00:46:27,600
I was like,
you can handle yourself all my

1132
00:46:27,601 --> 00:46:30,630
preconceived notions of like,
and it's something stupid,

1133
00:46:30,660 --> 00:46:32,880
a stupid male thing is to see a woman
fighting.

1134
00:46:32,910 --> 00:46:34,980
And then the first thought is,
Oh yeah,

1135
00:46:34,990 --> 00:46:36,870
somebody hurt her.
You know.

1136
00:46:36,900 --> 00:46:38,150
You got a lot of that in you.
Yeah,

1137
00:46:38,160 --> 00:46:38,570
yeah,
yeah.

1138
00:46:38,570 --> 00:46:41,340
That was me.
I know I had this people.

1139
00:46:44,310 --> 00:46:47,670
Everybody's hurting when.
Oh God,

1140
00:46:47,671 --> 00:46:49,350
this is,
this is like therapy.

1141
00:46:49,351 --> 00:46:50,270
It's coming out.
Yeah.

1142
00:46:50,320 --> 00:46:52,120
Maybe I was hurt.
Maybe you needed a cassette

1143
00:46:53,770 --> 00:46:54,740
sets.
I do.

1144
00:46:54,750 --> 00:46:56,100
I do.
I'm working on it,

1145
00:46:56,101 --> 00:46:59,130
man.
I just did your oldest fuck kids that

1146
00:46:59,131 --> 00:47:00,070
they're going like,
what is that?

1147
00:47:01,440 --> 00:47:04,260
They don't even know what a CD is.
A laser disc.

1148
00:47:04,261 --> 00:47:05,880
You little fuck.
Yeah.

1149
00:47:06,240 --> 00:47:08,160
What is this?
But the boxing has been cool.

1150
00:47:08,161 --> 00:47:11,880
I like a fun workout and you know,
women are weird though.

1151
00:47:11,900 --> 00:47:13,560
It is weird.
Somebody sent me a picture of this,

1152
00:47:13,561 --> 00:47:18,210
a mma chick and she was a,
there's this woman who's down and she's

1153
00:47:18,211 --> 00:47:20,010
a,
I don't know who the lady is,

1154
00:47:20,300 --> 00:47:22,170
I'm not familiar with our shells and
fight in the UFC,

1155
00:47:22,440 --> 00:47:27,030
but she's got blood on her and she's
going like this and she standing up over

1156
00:47:27,031 --> 00:47:28,350
this chick,
she's pounding,

1157
00:47:28,360 --> 00:47:31,030
she's like this,
and I'm like,

1158
00:47:31,060 --> 00:47:32,770
damn,
that is an angry woman.

1159
00:47:33,370 --> 00:47:35,220
I can't do those kinds of.
I can't,

1160
00:47:35,221 --> 00:47:36,970
I don't like male UFC.
I don't leave.

1161
00:47:36,980 --> 00:47:40,030
I just too violent for me.
I just live,

1162
00:47:40,140 --> 00:47:41,320
you know,
do you want to go?

1163
00:47:41,470 --> 00:47:45,130
I would go and I was watching the other
day because I heard your voice just one

1164
00:47:45,160 --> 00:47:46,510
in La in August.
I want to go.

1165
00:47:46,600 --> 00:47:50,860
I want to go because it just seems so
like very,

1166
00:47:50,870 --> 00:47:51,670
you know,
it is that,

1167
00:47:51,670 --> 00:47:53,860
by the way,
I find it like I,

1168
00:47:54,230 --> 00:47:56,380
I don't like watching women hit each
other,

1169
00:47:56,770 --> 00:47:57,850
you know?
I just don't like it.

1170
00:47:58,270 --> 00:47:59,800
I don't know,
maybe that's my male thing,

1171
00:47:59,890 --> 00:48:01,930
you know?
But I think that like how can we be in a

1172
00:48:01,931 --> 00:48:04,150
society where we're talking about no
violence against women?

1173
00:48:04,180 --> 00:48:06,010
What?
Unless it's paperview like,

1174
00:48:06,400 --> 00:48:09,050
no,
no violence against women by men is

1175
00:48:09,070 --> 00:48:09,690
okay.
Joe,

1176
00:48:09,690 --> 00:48:12,610
let me ask you some violence against
women competition.

1177
00:48:12,611 --> 00:48:16,120
Do you think that that woman that beat
up Rhonda Rousey,

1178
00:48:16,600 --> 00:48:21,010
Amanda Nunez,
do you think that I fight better than

1179
00:48:21,011 --> 00:48:21,460
her?

1180
00:48:21,460 --> 00:48:22,300
No.
She'll fuck you up.

1181
00:48:22,330 --> 00:48:24,490
She will fuck me up.
That's Amanda Nunez.

1182
00:48:24,520 --> 00:48:28,260
Okay.
But if I hit one arousing into face,

1183
00:48:28,720 --> 00:48:31,690
he liked her and I go out on a date.
We have something happens.

1184
00:48:31,691 --> 00:48:34,840
We have a scuffle and it gets on video
that I punched Ronda Rousey gonna face.

1185
00:48:35,110 --> 00:48:38,080
I'm now a pariah is society for the rest
of my life,

1186
00:48:38,081 --> 00:48:42,040
but this,
this woman who trains and it's like a

1187
00:48:42,041 --> 00:48:45,400
beast
will beat her up.

1188
00:48:45,401 --> 00:48:47,830
I just,
I can't get the disconnect.

1189
00:48:47,831 --> 00:48:49,240
I can't.
There's not a disconnect.

1190
00:48:49,241 --> 00:48:52,900
It's competition sport.
So I don't understand what.

1191
00:48:52,901 --> 00:48:54,940
What were you missing?
The connection.

1192
00:48:55,510 --> 00:48:58,120
There's such a big difference between
Eric Griffin.

1193
00:48:58,870 --> 00:49:01,030
First of all,
ron ain't going on a date with you.

1194
00:49:01,031 --> 00:49:04,000
Let's be honest.
You don't know what.

1195
00:49:04,180 --> 00:49:07,030
First of all,
how did Travis Brown and he's a fucking

1196
00:49:07,031 --> 00:49:07,841
killer.
Okay,

1197
00:49:07,841 --> 00:49:11,350
well maybe they have another batch.
Heavyweight.

1198
00:49:11,560 --> 00:49:15,490
UFC it so they have a tough patch that
we're going out to get something good.

1199
00:49:15,520 --> 00:49:17,860
I'm done.
I need to be some strange.

1200
00:49:17,861 --> 00:49:20,860
And she went to the comedy store if I'm
tired of being with a killer,

1201
00:49:20,920 --> 00:49:23,290
you know,
she wants somebody cuddly,

1202
00:49:23,320 --> 00:49:25,360
soft,
soft and squishy,

1203
00:49:25,361 --> 00:49:27,060
and then we'd go out on a date.
No,

1204
00:49:27,100 --> 00:49:29,110
you want a punching her because she
fucked.

1205
00:49:29,111 --> 00:49:30,310
Does that ever happen?
I don't know.

1206
00:49:30,320 --> 00:49:31,810
Maybe.
Have you ever punched anybody in your

1207
00:49:31,811 --> 00:49:32,570
life?
A girl?

1208
00:49:32,570 --> 00:49:34,050
No,
that's not what I was into.

1209
00:49:34,060 --> 00:49:36,280
Sixth grade.
I think I had a fight with a girl one

1210
00:49:36,281 --> 00:49:39,010
time and that's the first time I learned
you're not supposed to hit a girl.

1211
00:49:39,290 --> 00:49:40,060
Oh,
she was the,

1212
00:49:40,060 --> 00:49:42,640
she was a bully.
She was a bully and she was pushing

1213
00:49:42,641 --> 00:49:46,180
people and active and she did something
to me and I punched her and then no

1214
00:49:46,181 --> 00:49:50,770
matter what she did the whole yard when
you know,

1215
00:49:50,790 --> 00:49:52,090
like you don't hit a girl.

1216
00:49:52,120 --> 00:49:52,841
And I was like,
oh,

1217
00:49:52,841 --> 00:49:55,720
but remember everybody hated her like a
second ago.

1218
00:49:56,380 --> 00:49:58,420
Then all of a sudden,
so I knew at that point was outside.

1219
00:49:58,450 --> 00:49:59,081
Oh,
you can't do that.

1220
00:49:59,081 --> 00:50:00,370
I knew,
I knew that there's some kind of

1221
00:50:00,371 --> 00:50:01,630
difference.
I learned it then.

1222
00:50:01,900 --> 00:50:03,670
Yeah,
that's a good way to learn it before it

1223
00:50:03,671 --> 00:50:04,950
gets ugly before we get.
Sadly,

1224
00:50:05,300 --> 00:50:07,310
that was still a little kid.
Yeah.

1225
00:50:07,360 --> 00:50:08,900
It was like,
it was probably younger than that to

1226
00:50:09,820 --> 00:50:11,210
break anybody's job.
Right,

1227
00:50:11,240 --> 00:50:11,691
right,
right,

1228
00:50:11,691 --> 00:50:12,161
right,
right,

1229
00:50:12,161 --> 00:50:12,911
right.
And in what?

1230
00:50:12,911 --> 00:50:13,860
Piss me off too,
she,

1231
00:50:13,870 --> 00:50:17,740
I'll never forget this is so vivid in my
head that she admitted immediately went

1232
00:50:17,741 --> 00:50:22,741
from bully strong,
like I've run this court yard too.

1233
00:50:25,710 --> 00:50:28,020
And I was like,
bitch.

1234
00:50:28,060 --> 00:50:29,490
I was like,
what just happened?

1235
00:50:29,491 --> 00:50:30,660
You ever want to look her up?
Yeah,

1236
00:50:30,860 --> 00:50:33,020
I know.
Just what the fuck she's done to her

1237
00:50:33,021 --> 00:50:37,820
disaster of a life.
It was condoleeza rice actually don't

1238
00:50:37,840 --> 00:50:39,560
care.
What if it was somebody like that?

1239
00:50:39,920 --> 00:50:42,350
That would be crazy.
She's angry at you for punching her all

1240
00:50:42,351 --> 00:50:44,840
this time.
Starting wars in Syria and shit.

1241
00:50:44,870 --> 00:50:47,130
But I'm saying it could happen.
I'm with Ron.

1242
00:50:47,131 --> 00:50:51,200
Let's go back to the difference between
you punch and Rhonda is that would be

1243
00:50:51,201 --> 00:50:53,840
the last punch you ever through.
Flip you on your head,

1244
00:50:53,841 --> 00:50:55,720
on the concrete.
Smash your head open,

1245
00:50:55,740 --> 00:51:00,740
stomp you into a mud puddle and all this
on video all day would say is Erik

1246
00:51:01,580 --> 00:51:02,413
Griffin.
It's a woman

1247
00:51:04,220 --> 00:51:05,820
or he had a comment.
Yeah,

1248
00:51:05,840 --> 00:51:06,351
right,
right,

1249
00:51:06,351 --> 00:51:08,510
right.
Domestic abusers.

1250
00:51:09,590 --> 00:51:13,320
Strong woman.
I don't mean that in.

1251
00:51:13,450 --> 00:51:17,360
Rhonda is a professional mixed martial
arts champion.

1252
00:51:17,361 --> 00:51:21,410
She was a champion and one of the
greatest female champions of all time.

1253
00:51:21,470 --> 00:51:25,010
I didn't like seeing her face look like
she shouldn't have fought that woman.

1254
00:51:25,040 --> 00:51:26,240
I just,
I didn't like seeing it.

1255
00:51:26,260 --> 00:51:28,130
I guess what I'm saying there was I
couldn't.

1256
00:51:28,520 --> 00:51:30,680
I didn't feel any of that.
I didn't feel any of like,

1257
00:51:30,681 --> 00:51:32,170
oh,
it's the competition that she trains

1258
00:51:32,180 --> 00:51:35,210
know what I saw is a bruised and
battered woman.

1259
00:51:35,211 --> 00:51:37,430
That's what I saw and that's probably my
problem.

1260
00:51:37,820 --> 00:51:40,400
You must be talking about the Holly Holm
fight because that's when the one she

1261
00:51:40,401 --> 00:51:41,330
was about it.
Yeah.

1262
00:51:41,540 --> 00:51:46,540
That's when she got head kick and she
was bloody and it was a 48 seconds of

1263
00:51:48,140 --> 00:51:50,600
knuckles in the face.
That was a quick fight.

1264
00:51:50,740 --> 00:51:52,610
She just got the fuck beat out of her in
that fight,

1265
00:51:52,820 --> 00:51:56,240
but fights anymore.
But there's lessons in that.

1266
00:51:56,241 --> 00:51:59,140
See,
you can fight in mma and there's,

1267
00:51:59,430 --> 00:52:03,230
there's danger and there's consequences,
but if you're in shape and you're

1268
00:52:03,231 --> 00:52:05,330
prepared correctly,
you can fight,

1269
00:52:05,331 --> 00:52:08,630
but there's a lot of women that weren't
prepared correctly and Rhonda Fuck them

1270
00:52:08,631 --> 00:52:09,110
up.

1271
00:52:09,110 --> 00:52:10,410
That's just how it goes.
Let me.

1272
00:52:10,510 --> 00:52:12,890
Sometimes there's a name of.
So like sometimes you're the hammer,

1273
00:52:12,891 --> 00:52:15,800
sometimes you're the nail is also hot.
Pumped her up,

1274
00:52:16,050 --> 00:52:16,790
you know,
it was like,

1275
00:52:16,790 --> 00:52:20,690
it was a money marketing.
It was great marketing too.

1276
00:52:20,720 --> 00:52:23,600
She only hit me.
I pumped her up,

1277
00:52:24,770 --> 00:52:28,790
me doing a lot of the.
But it was based on what she'd been able

1278
00:52:28,791 --> 00:52:30,770
to accomplish.
It wasn't based on bullshit.

1279
00:52:30,980 --> 00:52:34,400
It was based on her actual performance
inside the octagon against people like

1280
00:52:34,610 --> 00:52:35,840
cats and gone,
oh,

1281
00:52:35,841 --> 00:52:37,640
against people like Sarah Mcmahon.
I mean,

1282
00:52:37,760 --> 00:52:40,550
which she had done was supremely
impressive.

1283
00:52:41,060 --> 00:52:45,380
But we love a champion.
We love undefeated.

1284
00:52:45,410 --> 00:52:49,790
We love being the best ever we we'd get
behind that.

1285
00:52:50,090 --> 00:52:52,340
Right.
And that's what was behind her going

1286
00:52:52,341 --> 00:52:54,110
into that fight.
Right.

1287
00:52:54,530 --> 00:52:57,410
And it didn't look like that.
That shouldn't have been behind her

1288
00:52:57,411 --> 00:52:58,190
going into that fight.

1289
00:52:58,190 --> 00:53:00,920
Maybe the Holly Holm fight,
Holly Holm funded even the Holly Holm

1290
00:53:00,921 --> 00:53:03,290
fight.
She was under massive amounts of

1291
00:53:03,291 --> 00:53:04,790
distractions.
She was under.

1292
00:53:04,970 --> 00:53:05,803
She was.
They were at.

1293
00:53:06,140 --> 00:53:08,830
They were going to do roadhouse.
Remember they're going to do a roadhouse

1294
00:53:08,870 --> 00:53:11,960
movie.
She's having meetings with agents and

1295
00:53:12,240 --> 00:53:14,870
they just thought she could fuck up
anybody on the planet.

1296
00:53:14,871 --> 00:53:18,530
That's what I'm saying.
The problem is in less didn't look like

1297
00:53:18,830 --> 00:53:22,460
a hundred percent.
All in with your training and your

1298
00:53:22,461 --> 00:53:24,890
learning and your development,
you're making sure that you've got the

1299
00:53:25,140 --> 00:53:28,980
training partners and the right coaching
and the right staff and nutrition and

1300
00:53:28,981 --> 00:53:30,720
all these different things.
If you don't,

1301
00:53:30,721 --> 00:53:33,180
if you have any,
any part of that missing,

1302
00:53:33,450 --> 00:53:37,350
then the people coming up who have all
those bases covered,

1303
00:53:37,470 --> 00:53:39,690
they're going to surpass.
You are talented too,

1304
00:53:39,691 --> 00:53:41,910
and that's what happened with her.
You're knee deep in the world.

1305
00:53:42,030 --> 00:53:43,080
You know everything about it.

1306
00:53:43,350 --> 00:53:44,970
Okay.
As a lay person,

1307
00:53:45,420 --> 00:53:47,370
just looking at them standing next to
each other.

1308
00:53:47,430 --> 00:53:48,320
I was like,
oh,

1309
00:53:48,360 --> 00:53:51,450
she gonna get her ass beat.
So you looking at Rhonda standing next

1310
00:53:51,451 --> 00:53:53,470
to Holly Holm to Ronda was going to get
harassed.

1311
00:53:53,530 --> 00:53:54,363
But yes,
I,

1312
00:53:54,450 --> 00:53:55,530
when I saw it,
I was like,

1313
00:53:55,860 --> 00:53:57,510
how's this going to work?
Why did you think the,

1314
00:53:57,570 --> 00:53:59,460
I don't know,
but just the eye test.

1315
00:53:59,461 --> 00:54:00,360
She just looked.
Holly,

1316
00:54:00,370 --> 00:54:01,171
Gary,
physically,

1317
00:54:01,171 --> 00:54:02,910
she looked bigger.
She was at.

1318
00:54:03,210 --> 00:54:05,010
She was physically bigger than this
person.

1319
00:54:05,400 --> 00:54:06,810
Seen Sarah Mcmahon.
No,

1320
00:54:06,920 --> 00:54:10,350
Rhonda stops Sara Mcmahon in one round.
Sarah Mcmahon was an Olympic silver

1321
00:54:10,351 --> 00:54:13,470
medalist and wrestling and she's a tank.
I wasn't into it like that.

1322
00:54:13,471 --> 00:54:15,360
Maybe if I'd seen that I would've been
like,

1323
00:54:15,361 --> 00:54:19,260
well this is going to be a good fight.
But that was my first time and I just

1324
00:54:19,261 --> 00:54:20,071
looking at it,
I was like,

1325
00:54:20,071 --> 00:54:21,630
this doesn't look like this is going to
be a good fight.

1326
00:54:21,690 --> 00:54:24,790
That's just know.
It just,

1327
00:54:25,020 --> 00:54:26,610
I just didn't.
I just didn't think it was going to be a

1328
00:54:26,611 --> 00:54:29,070
good fight.
And then when did you hear just you hear

1329
00:54:29,071 --> 00:54:30,810
you guys talking,
you hear like,

1330
00:54:30,811 --> 00:54:32,580
the guy's going to get all that Holly
Holmes,

1331
00:54:32,680 --> 00:54:34,350
she's a box or in this and that.
And I'm like,

1332
00:54:34,380 --> 00:54:36,900
Oh wow,
this isn't gonna go well.

1333
00:54:37,020 --> 00:54:41,100
And then sure enough it didn't go well.
So then that made me have the respect

1334
00:54:41,101 --> 00:54:43,480
level for female,
you know,

1335
00:54:43,770 --> 00:54:46,950
fighting if I'm just coming in,
like at that time,

1336
00:54:46,951 --> 00:54:48,780
you know,
it was like Ronda Rousey's everywhere.

1337
00:54:48,781 --> 00:54:49,990
She's in movies,
she's in like,

1338
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:51,030
you know,
and then you're like,

1339
00:54:51,060 --> 00:54:52,590
oh wow,
this is the greatest fighter ever right

1340
00:54:52,591 --> 00:54:53,530
here.
This is the chief's,

1341
00:54:53,620 --> 00:54:55,530
the,
the attraction of a lifetime.

1342
00:54:55,740 --> 00:54:56,640
And then you go,
okay,

1343
00:54:57,480 --> 00:54:58,231
I'm gonna,
check it out.

1344
00:54:58,231 --> 00:54:59,250
Let me check out.
Wow,

1345
00:54:59,251 --> 00:55:00,084
that girl looks big.

1346
00:55:00,090 --> 00:55:03,450
I don't think this is going to.
And then she gets demolished and you're

1347
00:55:03,451 --> 00:55:03,841
like,
well,

1348
00:55:03,841 --> 00:55:07,200
is this a sport?
I think that was a big blow for female

1349
00:55:07,201 --> 00:55:08,440
fighting.
What are you talking about?

1350
00:55:08,441 --> 00:55:10,590
There was like one of the best things to
ever happen to feminist finding.

1351
00:55:11,430 --> 00:55:12,630
Okay,
well we're different in that way.

1352
00:55:12,631 --> 00:55:14,370
I think she should have one,
would've been the best thing.

1353
00:55:14,400 --> 00:55:15,380
No,
no,

1354
00:55:15,390 --> 00:55:17,850
no.
It's good to know that anyone can lose.

1355
00:55:18,030 --> 00:55:19,920
Even the greats,
even the greats,

1356
00:55:19,921 --> 00:55:22,050
they get it.
We get paired to boxing too much is what

1357
00:55:22,051 --> 00:55:23,700
it is.
Boxing has gotta be you gotta be

1358
00:55:23,701 --> 00:55:24,770
undefeated,
you know,

1359
00:55:24,780 --> 00:55:26,160
boxing.
We love undefeated.

1360
00:55:26,220 --> 00:55:28,470
One blemish on your record and it does
something.

1361
00:55:28,770 --> 00:55:30,390
It doesn't work like that in MMA.
Right,

1362
00:55:30,391 --> 00:55:30,691
right,
right.

1363
00:55:30,691 --> 00:55:32,760
Because in mma there's so many different
ways to win.

1364
00:55:32,761 --> 00:55:36,270
The only one is really undefeated at the
top of the food chain is.

1365
00:55:36,300 --> 00:55:37,133
Well,
two guys,

1366
00:55:37,140 --> 00:55:38,500
Khabib,
neuroma Madoff,

1367
00:55:38,510 --> 00:55:40,950
who was the lightweight champion.
He's undefeated period.

1368
00:55:40,951 --> 00:55:45,320
Mauled everybody except l I acquainted
went the distance with them and you

1369
00:55:45,321 --> 00:55:46,560
know,
but still beat his ass.

1370
00:55:47,100 --> 00:55:50,250
Still beat him,
but John Jones is really undefeated.

1371
00:55:50,251 --> 00:55:53,370
Jon Jones has one loss in his career,
but it's a disqualification.

1372
00:55:53,440 --> 00:55:56,970
Is he the guy that's been disqualified
because he was well dogs or something

1373
00:55:57,070 --> 00:56:00,870
got caught with some shit in his system
that he shouldn't have had in the system

1374
00:56:00,871 --> 00:56:02,670
and how did he get into it in the
system?

1375
00:56:02,671 --> 00:56:04,770
We don't know.
It was only in there for a very short

1376
00:56:04,771 --> 00:56:07,050
amount of time.
There's a lot of speculation.

1377
00:56:07,140 --> 00:56:09,620
We don't until that gets ironed out.
By the way,

1378
00:56:09,630 --> 00:56:12,180
one of my good friends in the whole wide
world is Eric Koch.

1379
00:56:12,630 --> 00:56:16,680
He's also a UFC MMA fighter.
You Know Eric Koch from two cruises as a

1380
00:56:16,700 --> 00:56:17,291
Gen.
Yeah,

1381
00:56:17,291 --> 00:56:18,450
Eric.
He's a good buddy.

1382
00:56:18,451 --> 00:56:19,460
We played.
You know how I know him?

1383
00:56:19,470 --> 00:56:20,940
We play video games together.
Oh,

1384
00:56:20,941 --> 00:56:21,600
no shit.
Yeah,

1385
00:56:21,600 --> 00:56:22,800
yeah.
We've a motherfucker.

1386
00:56:22,801 --> 00:56:23,740
He really is.
He's,

1387
00:56:23,780 --> 00:56:24,100
he's

1388
00:56:24,100 --> 00:56:26,800
a crazy dude.
Now I know that if I'm in public and

1389
00:56:26,801 --> 00:56:29,170
some shit is about to go down.
I checked people's ears.

1390
00:56:29,380 --> 00:56:30,310
Oh,
that's a good move.

1391
00:56:30,360 --> 00:56:31,050
Yeah.
Yeah.

1392
00:56:31,050 --> 00:56:33,550
But sometimes his ear look.
Yeah,

1393
00:56:33,560 --> 00:56:35,680
but some bees out there that we're
guards.

1394
00:56:35,770 --> 00:56:37,210
Yeah,
but no,

1395
00:56:37,220 --> 00:56:38,830
but I'm saying I'm not gonna fight
anyway.

1396
00:56:38,831 --> 00:56:39,540
I know,
but don't.

1397
00:56:39,540 --> 00:56:41,080
It's one more year of boxing.
I might.

1398
00:56:41,590 --> 00:56:44,700
I might be like,
you don't want me doing that pattern.

1399
00:56:44,950 --> 00:56:46,990
Started thinking.
Yeah man,

1400
00:56:46,991 --> 00:56:48,100
listen,
that noise I'm making.

1401
00:56:49,090 --> 00:56:49,880
No,
dude.

1402
00:56:49,880 --> 00:56:52,120
Can I tell you one quick.
The first time I ever boxed,

1403
00:56:52,121 --> 00:56:52,990
I was like,
uh,

1404
00:56:53,350 --> 00:56:56,680
I went with Craig Robinson on cracker
box at each other.

1405
00:56:56,830 --> 00:56:59,410
Know we weren't boxing each other,
but Craig was starting to box and he

1406
00:56:59,470 --> 00:57:01,300
took me to the gym and it was this old
black dude.

1407
00:57:01,301 --> 00:57:02,860
He was like in his sixties,
right?

1408
00:57:02,890 --> 00:57:03,723
Old School black.

1409
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:05,500
So I got into the ring with him.
The Guy,

1410
00:57:05,530 --> 00:57:06,011
he was like,
hi,

1411
00:57:06,011 --> 00:57:06,844
come on.
In the ring,

1412
00:57:07,030 --> 00:57:08,920
you know,
so I'm in there and we're boxing he

1413
00:57:09,280 --> 00:57:11,440
three minutes,
I have so much more respect for boxers

1414
00:57:11,441 --> 00:57:13,000
after doing this.
So he's like,

1415
00:57:13,001 --> 00:57:13,834
Yo,
keep your hands up,

1416
00:57:14,290 --> 00:57:15,550
keep your hands up,
you know,

1417
00:57:15,551 --> 00:57:16,384
and I'm like,
alright.

1418
00:57:16,440 --> 00:57:19,660
And then he hit me in the head.
Joe didn't keep your head up and I was

1419
00:57:19,661 --> 00:57:21,550
like,
after he hit me twice,

1420
00:57:21,700 --> 00:57:26,700
something locks in man get angry and
then it was like 30 seconds left in the

1421
00:57:27,440 --> 00:57:29,220
fight and he put his hands up.
He was like,

1422
00:57:29,530 --> 00:57:31,600
finished the fight like you own the
street.

1423
00:57:32,170 --> 00:57:34,180
Don't understand.
Finally drawn and street.

1424
00:57:34,420 --> 00:57:36,830
And I kicked him in the nuts.
I went like sales off.

1425
00:57:36,880 --> 00:57:41,880
I went like this
box again for a little while until

1426
00:57:43,631 --> 00:57:45,880
recently.
So that was one time.

1427
00:57:45,910 --> 00:57:47,110
It was once.
It was so hard.

1428
00:57:47,140 --> 00:57:48,730
It was like that three minutes.
I was like,

1429
00:57:48,731 --> 00:57:53,170
how can these people throw 50 punches?
Well you got to build up to it,

1430
00:57:53,171 --> 00:57:55,780
Eric.
I'm going to man to come here.

1431
00:57:56,730 --> 00:57:59,470
I need to.
I want to know what I need to work out.

1432
00:57:59,471 --> 00:58:01,280
I need to.
He's laughing.

1433
00:58:01,870 --> 00:58:04,210
He's laughing like you can't deal with
the Joe Rogan workout.

1434
00:58:04,320 --> 00:58:08,710
The key is to do a workout top.
I thought about doing one a while ago,

1435
00:58:08,711 --> 00:58:11,600
but
I'd read this.

1436
00:58:11,920 --> 00:58:14,790
I do too many things publicly.
I'd rather just keep someone's to just

1437
00:58:14,800 --> 00:58:18,280
myself.
This is a man who has a family now has,

1438
00:58:18,580 --> 00:58:22,480
has reached a level of success that he
is comfortable and now you're starting

1439
00:58:22,481 --> 00:58:24,850
to see like not everyone needs to know
everything.

1440
00:58:24,910 --> 00:58:29,350
It's not just that there's value in
doing things just for you.

1441
00:58:29,560 --> 00:58:30,380
Not.
No,

1442
00:58:30,380 --> 00:58:30,641
no,
no,

1443
00:58:30,641 --> 00:58:31,330
no,
no,

1444
00:58:31,330 --> 00:58:31,720
no.

1445
00:58:31,720 --> 00:58:34,270
Just working on stuff and doing things
just for you.

1446
00:58:34,271 --> 00:58:35,950
Don't do things publicly.
Agree.

1447
00:58:36,400 --> 00:58:38,500
In this day and age,
everybody does everything on social

1448
00:58:38,501 --> 00:58:41,110
media and I've done a bunch of things,
put them on social media,

1449
00:58:41,111 --> 00:58:44,860
but I think there's real.
There's benefit like why did you do the

1450
00:58:44,861 --> 00:58:46,120
things you do?
Well,

1451
00:58:46,121 --> 00:58:48,400
I do the things I do for two reasons.
One,

1452
00:58:48,520 --> 00:58:51,460
either I enjoy them or I think they make
me better.

1453
00:58:51,820 --> 00:58:54,290
They make me a better person.
Like it all.

1454
00:58:54,310 --> 00:58:56,050
Be on your tape.
I do a lot of yoga.

1455
00:58:56,240 --> 00:58:59,680
I did yoga today and I do it.
I do it a lot and one of the reasons why

1456
00:58:59,681 --> 00:59:01,300
I do it,
I think it makes me a better person.

1457
00:59:01,330 --> 00:59:03,970
I think it makes me more mellow,
which I think is good.

1458
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:08,980
I have a tendency to not be mo mellow.
It makes me more friendly.

1459
00:59:09,100 --> 00:59:12,040
I think it calms me down and I think
it's very good for my body,

1460
00:59:12,041 --> 00:59:14,220
so I do it all the time,
but I'm not about to do some fucking

1461
00:59:14,560 --> 00:59:15,400
yoga video.

1462
00:59:15,430 --> 00:59:18,090
I think I do stand up for that reason.
Yoga calm.

1463
00:59:18,091 --> 00:59:19,400
He calms you down.
Yeah.

1464
00:59:19,490 --> 00:59:20,650
Yeah.
That's interesting.

1465
00:59:20,651 --> 00:59:21,680
Yeah.
I do stand up to like,

1466
00:59:21,681 --> 00:59:22,120
yeah,
it did.

1467
00:59:22,120 --> 00:59:23,240
It does.
It calms me down.

1468
00:59:23,270 --> 00:59:26,030
If something happens to me,
I go directly to the stage.

1469
00:59:26,320 --> 00:59:29,750
That's a great way to work on it though.
Like can develop material.

1470
00:59:29,760 --> 00:59:30,180
Yeah,
that's what,

1471
00:59:30,180 --> 00:59:32,390
that's what happens.
Even if it's something silly.

1472
00:59:32,391 --> 00:59:35,420
Like if I see a movie that moves me,
I might go on stage and be like,

1473
00:59:35,421 --> 00:59:38,000
did y'all see this movie and where are
you working out now?

1474
00:59:38,001 --> 00:59:40,250
I know you do the store and I know you
do the factory,

1475
00:59:40,251 --> 00:59:41,890
but do you fuck around and go to the
[inaudible],

1476
00:59:41,960 --> 00:59:44,450
the ice house flippers,
all that shit.

1477
00:59:44,530 --> 00:59:46,220
My start was I,
when I,

1478
00:59:46,221 --> 00:59:49,820
when I knew I wanted to do this,
I was going to open mics and then I went

1479
00:59:49,821 --> 00:59:50,540
to Long Beach.

1480
00:59:50,540 --> 00:59:54,410
They had just placed cog queen,
the Queen Mary and they had a laugh is

1481
00:59:54,411 --> 00:59:57,050
hope.
This Guy Steve Kimbro had this really

1482
00:59:57,051 --> 01:00:00,680
shitty club on the Queen Mary.
We did fear factor and the Queen Mary.

1483
01:00:00,681 --> 01:00:03,530
It was right down there.
And I remember someone was doing a room

1484
01:00:03,531 --> 01:00:05,150
there.
That's the room you're talking about.

1485
01:00:05,151 --> 01:00:08,380
So I did that and then I started doing,
uh,

1486
01:00:08,390 --> 01:00:11,960
the ice house.
The annex does a good room and they had

1487
01:00:11,961 --> 01:00:14,660
that three shows on Friday,
three shows on Saturday.

1488
01:00:14,780 --> 01:00:17,060
So that started doing that.
From there I went to the Ha,

1489
01:00:17,100 --> 01:00:19,430
ha.
Then I was like hosting on the weekends.

1490
01:00:19,431 --> 01:00:21,460
And then Terry Terry from the hall,
you know,

1491
01:00:21,560 --> 01:00:22,820
God bless her soul.
What are you doing?

1492
01:00:22,821 --> 01:00:24,080
Wednesday night?
Wednesday night.

1493
01:00:24,081 --> 01:00:25,490
I'm around.
You want to do the Ice House?

1494
01:00:25,550 --> 01:00:26,031
Yeah,
let's do it.

1495
01:00:26,031 --> 01:00:27,690
I'm just saying that 10:00 PM,
10:00 PM,

1496
01:00:27,760 --> 01:00:29,330
Nice House.
I'm with Joe Rogan.

1497
01:00:30,500 --> 01:00:32,660
Tony Hinchcliffe on the show to the
other Tony.

1498
01:00:32,780 --> 01:00:34,890
So then I went to the.
I went to the ice house,

1499
01:00:35,150 --> 01:00:38,750
then I started going to [inaudible] and
then I got to showcase at the comedy

1500
01:00:38,751 --> 01:00:42,310
store and Mitzi didn't even look at me.
She didn't even look.

1501
01:00:42,320 --> 01:00:44,630
I didn't even talk to me.
What year this was.

1502
01:00:44,700 --> 01:00:47,600
It was a year.
Jay Davis got passed so I wanted to kill

1503
01:00:47,601 --> 01:00:51,200
myself.
I showcased with Jay Davis.

1504
01:00:51,770 --> 01:00:52,970
That's not rude.
Jay.

1505
01:00:53,560 --> 01:00:55,790
Jay knows I'll say this to his fucking
face.

1506
01:00:58,400 --> 01:01:03,110
He knows.
So we're showcasing the same day right

1507
01:01:03,500 --> 01:01:06,710
as she passed him and then didn't even
talk to me.

1508
01:01:06,920 --> 01:01:08,330
Okay.
So I wasn't even watching.

1509
01:01:08,360 --> 01:01:10,970
She didn't want.
She watched me and I went down.

1510
01:01:10,971 --> 01:01:12,470
I was,
like I said she didn't like it.

1511
01:01:12,471 --> 01:01:14,620
That's what I thought,
not which really pissed me off here.

1512
01:01:14,660 --> 01:01:18,380
His skin do.
This must have been 2000,

1513
01:01:18,830 --> 01:01:22,570
2003 ish.
So this is when Jay was on Torque.

1514
01:01:22,571 --> 01:01:27,410
Asm with Dane Cook.
Dane was supposed to showcase that night

1515
01:01:27,420 --> 01:01:29,420
too,
but he refused to come because he was

1516
01:01:29,421 --> 01:01:31,410
Dane Cook and I get it.
So he refused to show.

1517
01:01:31,590 --> 01:01:32,301
Well,
that's what I hear.

1518
01:01:32,301 --> 01:01:33,134
I shouldn't even say,
oh,

1519
01:01:34,580 --> 01:01:36,270
I should have asked him before I'm
talking about this,

1520
01:01:36,530 --> 01:01:37,730
but I had.
You had to showcase,

1521
01:01:37,731 --> 01:01:39,380
right.
I know Louis Ck didn't get passed at the

1522
01:01:39,390 --> 01:01:43,360
store.
I mean like she got her own thing,

1523
01:01:43,790 --> 01:01:47,960
so I,
I get to showcase my then friend a Metta

1524
01:01:47,960 --> 01:01:52,760
Med is setup to showcase that night and
I didn't get passed so a year and a half

1525
01:01:52,761 --> 01:01:54,410
later I had to,
I had to deal with Tommy,

1526
01:01:54,650 --> 01:01:55,690
you know,
and,

1527
01:01:55,691 --> 01:01:58,380
and listen as,
as what people get on him and I,

1528
01:01:58,470 --> 01:02:00,320
I think Tommy's out there thinks I hate
him,

1529
01:02:00,500 --> 01:02:03,140
but I know there was a method to his
madness,

1530
01:02:03,470 --> 01:02:04,350
you know,
and it.

1531
01:02:04,360 --> 01:02:08,390
And maybe if he didn't even know it,
it worked for me because he was my

1532
01:02:08,391 --> 01:02:10,580
villain.
He was my enemy.

1533
01:02:10,910 --> 01:02:12,530
Okay.
So I had to get past him.

1534
01:02:12,531 --> 01:02:14,690
He was the gatekeeper.
I had to get past.

1535
01:02:15,020 --> 01:02:19,190
So it took me a year and a half of doing
belly room and,

1536
01:02:19,230 --> 01:02:21,030
and,
and just hanging around and people keep

1537
01:02:21,031 --> 01:02:21,721
saying to him,
Hey,

1538
01:02:21,721 --> 01:02:23,460
you should put her griffin,
you know.

1539
01:02:23,520 --> 01:02:26,310
So then I got another showcase.
It was in the main room,

1540
01:02:26,630 --> 01:02:28,710
uh,
during one of those bringer shows.

1541
01:02:28,711 --> 01:02:31,650
They were doing the showcases during
those and she was there.

1542
01:02:31,710 --> 01:02:34,080
They had her in our booth and I did my
set.

1543
01:02:34,081 --> 01:02:35,960
I ran the fucking light to,
you know,

1544
01:02:35,980 --> 01:02:36,930
I was like,
fuck this,

1545
01:02:37,700 --> 01:02:39,600
what year are we talking about this?
This is like a,

1546
01:02:39,601 --> 01:02:41,550
like a year later.
So it's like 2005,

1547
01:02:42,300 --> 01:02:43,500
2000,
about 2005,

1548
01:02:43,501 --> 01:02:47,160
2006 around,
just around that time.

1549
01:02:47,190 --> 01:02:47,970
Two thousand four or five six.

1550
01:02:47,970 --> 01:02:49,140
I'm not sure what it was,
you know.

1551
01:02:49,350 --> 01:02:52,440
And then as I'm leaving there,
they're bringing her through the,

1552
01:02:52,480 --> 01:02:53,790
the,
the main room and their,

1553
01:02:53,791 --> 01:02:55,230
you know,
their hair helping her through the

1554
01:02:55,231 --> 01:02:58,950
hallway to go to the kitchen and she
stops and she looks at me and says,

1555
01:02:59,160 --> 01:03:03,060
you have funny.
Those are the only words she ever spoke

1556
01:03:03,061 --> 01:03:04,410
to me.
That's all you need.

1557
01:03:04,440 --> 01:03:07,700
That's all I needed.
And then Tommy comes over and he was

1558
01:03:07,701 --> 01:03:08,011
like,
wow,

1559
01:03:08,011 --> 01:03:08,331
yo,
yo,

1560
01:03:08,331 --> 01:03:08,800
Yo,
Yo,

1561
01:03:08,800 --> 01:03:09,330
Yo,
Yo,

1562
01:03:09,330 --> 01:03:12,150
she passed you.
You're in the belly room now headbutted

1563
01:03:12,151 --> 01:03:14,310
him.
Retina knows was fucking mouth,

1564
01:03:14,340 --> 01:03:15,500
right.
Fuck.

1565
01:03:15,540 --> 01:03:17,700
And then he told me I had to be in the
belly room for a year.

1566
01:03:17,701 --> 01:03:20,010
And I knew that was a lie.
He passed me.

1567
01:03:20,011 --> 01:03:21,270
So again,
but I needed the,

1568
01:03:21,330 --> 01:03:22,970
I needed the challenge,
you know,

1569
01:03:23,010 --> 01:03:26,130
you know,
one of my best moments for me personally

1570
01:03:27,600 --> 01:03:30,620
because I got to tell you,
handbag

1571
01:03:32,850 --> 01:03:35,610
bad richard over at a comedy and magic,
you know.

1572
01:03:35,750 --> 01:03:37,080
And I love it.
I love Richard.

1573
01:03:37,170 --> 01:03:39,300
So I tried to,
I tried to showcase for Richard are the

1574
01:03:39,301 --> 01:03:40,620
nicest people ever.
They were so nice.

1575
01:03:40,650 --> 01:03:44,190
They treat comics that asked as you go
there,

1576
01:03:44,220 --> 01:03:47,790
you go there not to do comedy.
You go there to get food at a hug,

1577
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:50,490
hug people hanging out with good people,
man for real.

1578
01:03:50,760 --> 01:03:52,800
So I remember I tried to showcase for
him,

1579
01:03:52,801 --> 01:03:54,600
I sent him a tape and he was like,
Erica,

1580
01:03:54,601 --> 01:03:56,640
too dirty and all this stuff and he
wouldn't pass me.

1581
01:03:56,940 --> 01:03:59,640
So Mazda Brawny.
This is years later now.

1582
01:03:59,670 --> 01:04:01,440
Mazda bronys doing a show and he says,
Eric,

1583
01:04:01,441 --> 01:04:04,050
you won't be on my show,
so I'm standing in the hallway before I

1584
01:04:04,051 --> 01:04:07,620
go on with the MC and then we're joking
about being clean,

1585
01:04:07,621 --> 01:04:08,221
and I said,
you know what,

1586
01:04:08,221 --> 01:04:09,570
I'm going to go up there and pull my
dick out.

1587
01:04:09,720 --> 01:04:11,460
A guy in a suit is walking down the
hallway.

1588
01:04:14,160 --> 01:04:15,360
This guy,
this dude just walking.

1589
01:04:15,361 --> 01:04:15,990
He goes,
hey,

1590
01:04:15,990 --> 01:04:17,490
please don't do that.
And I go,

1591
01:04:17,570 --> 01:04:18,420
you know,
I'm just kidding.

1592
01:04:18,510 --> 01:04:20,820
And we laugh a little bit.
We laugh a little bit.

1593
01:04:20,850 --> 01:04:22,590
I go onstage,
I'm murder it,

1594
01:04:22,830 --> 01:04:25,530
and then I'm headed to the green room
and that same guy in the suit comes

1595
01:04:25,531 --> 01:04:27,420
running at me and it's Mike is the
owner.

1596
01:04:27,480 --> 01:04:28,350
Oh,
that's hilarious.

1597
01:04:28,351 --> 01:04:29,340
And he says,
Hey.

1598
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:30,870
He goes,
man,

1599
01:04:31,050 --> 01:04:33,870
you're hilarious.
Why aren't you working at my club?

1600
01:04:33,871 --> 01:04:38,460
Why don't I know you at that moment.
Richard is in the hallway and then I

1601
01:04:38,461 --> 01:04:40,080
look at Richard and I go,
yeah,

1602
01:04:40,081 --> 01:04:41,910
Richard,
why am I not working here?

1603
01:04:43,210 --> 01:04:44,120
He's like,
why would you do,

1604
01:04:44,210 --> 01:04:45,960
do you know you're dirty?
I was like,

1605
01:04:45,990 --> 01:04:47,940
I can play clean.
I play churches.

1606
01:04:47,941 --> 01:04:50,460
I played cruise ships.
I'm a professional comedian.

1607
01:04:51,060 --> 01:04:55,980
My point about this is that moment of
him squirming and like being like,

1608
01:04:55,981 --> 01:04:58,410
okay,
you're in Canada and after that I was in

1609
01:04:59,130 --> 01:05:03,960
that was worth waiting for as opposed to
like trying to bully my way into places.

1610
01:05:04,560 --> 01:05:06,330
Like I felt like I earned that.
Yeah.

1611
01:05:06,470 --> 01:05:08,640
And I.
and since then rich and I were friends,

1612
01:05:08,700 --> 01:05:09,533
you know,
it's like,

1613
01:05:09,600 --> 01:05:11,490
but I had to,
I had to earn that.

1614
01:05:11,550 --> 01:05:13,890
You have to earn it.
I had to like find the right moment.

1615
01:05:13,950 --> 01:05:15,120
I had to like,
you know what I mean?

1616
01:05:15,450 --> 01:05:16,860
I could,
I could.

1617
01:05:16,861 --> 01:05:17,980
I have been on the Wednesday night.

1618
01:05:17,980 --> 01:05:20,260
I saw show with Joe Rogan before
possibly.

1619
01:05:21,090 --> 01:05:23,380
Do you know,
like you got to get into these

1620
01:05:23,381 --> 01:05:25,870
situations.
Joey can't work with me at the Ice

1621
01:05:25,870 --> 01:05:28,140
House.
The one place they won't have them to

1622
01:05:28,240 --> 01:05:29,270
dirty.
What do you do with?

1623
01:05:29,950 --> 01:05:32,450
He went,
he went up and talking about sniffing

1624
01:05:32,460 --> 01:05:35,060
his balls and to many one to many cock
sucker.

1625
01:05:36,330 --> 01:05:39,390
Stick his nose up,
girls asses what's going down and I'm

1626
01:05:39,400 --> 01:05:43,060
from behind.
I do the pigeon and and they would just

1627
01:05:43,061 --> 01:05:43,781
fuck.
First of all,

1628
01:05:43,781 --> 01:05:47,200
he was murdering to the point where like
drinks were falling off tables,

1629
01:05:47,201 --> 01:05:51,580
the lights were dimming,
they're shorting out and Mike was like,

1630
01:05:51,740 --> 01:05:53,410
you know Mike,
the sweetest guy in the world.

1631
01:05:53,411 --> 01:05:54,250
He goes,
I love you.

1632
01:05:54,251 --> 01:05:56,140
I think you're amazing.
Like it was,

1633
01:05:56,141 --> 01:05:58,520
but I can have you in this club.
You're just dirty.

1634
01:05:58,740 --> 01:05:59,381
She's like,
look.

1635
01:05:59,381 --> 01:06:00,310
He goes,
I understand

1636
01:06:01,880 --> 01:06:03,040
Joe.
He wasn't mad at him,

1637
01:06:03,200 --> 01:06:04,630
you know,
he's like one of the only guys that told

1638
01:06:04,631 --> 01:06:06,010
Joey that he can't work,
but Joe,

1639
01:06:06,011 --> 01:06:07,480
he was already successful by then.

1640
01:06:07,810 --> 01:06:08,710
He just would work,
you know,

1641
01:06:08,711 --> 01:06:09,700
Joe,
he always works with me.

1642
01:06:09,701 --> 01:06:13,720
So he just didn't want to do it
is,

1643
01:06:14,070 --> 01:06:16,520
you know joey called.
You know what I got to say,

1644
01:06:16,521 --> 01:06:18,790
like one of the,
one of my favorite phone calls I've had

1645
01:06:19,180 --> 01:06:22,050
is Joey Diaz calling me the other day.
He,

1646
01:06:22,230 --> 01:06:23,170
you know,
I don't do this.

1647
01:06:23,410 --> 01:06:24,243
I'll call,
you know,

1648
01:06:24,690 --> 01:06:25,990
you will.
You're really good on.

1649
01:06:25,991 --> 01:06:28,420
I'm dying up here.
And he's just given me compliments.

1650
01:06:28,660 --> 01:06:30,070
That's beautiful.
And I just don't.

1651
01:06:30,450 --> 01:06:34,110
And I was like,
when this comes from someone that you

1652
01:06:34,150 --> 01:06:39,040
believe is 100 percent genuine,
and then the way,

1653
01:06:39,050 --> 01:06:41,380
the way he was talking about it,
I thought I was like,

1654
01:06:41,410 --> 01:06:42,070
oh,
that's great.

1655
01:06:42,070 --> 01:06:44,170
That's what you want.
That's what I learned when I got back

1656
01:06:44,171 --> 01:06:45,280
into it later too.
By the way,

1657
01:06:45,430 --> 01:06:47,560
when I was 30,
I knew that you had to get the respect

1658
01:06:47,561 --> 01:06:50,980
of your peers,
these people that you do this business

1659
01:06:50,981 --> 01:06:53,310
with have to think you're funny because
those are the people that are going to

1660
01:06:53,320 --> 01:06:54,010
get you work.

1661
01:06:54,010 --> 01:06:54,461
Well,
they have to,

1662
01:06:54,461 --> 01:06:55,640
like you said,
like youtube,

1663
01:06:55,990 --> 01:06:58,780
that's a big one.
Like Kevin would be a nice person and

1664
01:06:58,781 --> 01:07:00,910
you know,
we're going to be what you are in a very

1665
01:07:00,911 --> 01:07:02,590
nice person.
But one of the things that's nice about

1666
01:07:02,591 --> 01:07:05,590
the comedy store for sure is that,
um,

1667
01:07:05,830 --> 01:07:06,930
I think,
and this is,

1668
01:07:06,950 --> 01:07:09,550
I attribute this to the Internet because
I think what's going on with the

1669
01:07:09,551 --> 01:07:11,560
Internet now is there's so many
opportunities for the community,

1670
01:07:11,590 --> 01:07:14,770
for comedians now that we're not in
competition with each other anymore.

1671
01:07:14,800 --> 01:07:17,410
I don't think we've ever been.
We used to be like that man,

1672
01:07:17,411 --> 01:07:20,380
the nineties in the nineties,
everybody was like Doggie dog.

1673
01:07:20,381 --> 01:07:24,640
It was different like there was a lot of
people back then that felt like say if

1674
01:07:24,641 --> 01:07:26,830
you got something,
you got a TV show,

1675
01:07:26,831 --> 01:07:29,650
why didn't I get that fucking show?
As people that thought there was a

1676
01:07:29,651 --> 01:07:30,760
limited number of things.

1677
01:07:30,760 --> 01:07:33,610
It's what I call famine thinking.
You ever heard that expression?

1678
01:07:33,611 --> 01:07:35,140
Yes,
I know exactly what that expression is.

1679
01:07:35,141 --> 01:07:39,250
A deadly fucking.
It's just a poison to your life and the

1680
01:07:39,251 --> 01:07:42,220
way you think about the world that a lot
of people have that problem,

1681
01:07:42,221 --> 01:07:45,160
that famine thinking.
I think people still feel like that now.

1682
01:07:45,161 --> 01:07:46,380
And uh,
but I always,

1683
01:07:46,420 --> 01:07:48,100
I always liken it to golf.
You know,

1684
01:07:48,101 --> 01:07:52,060
I think that we're on a leader board,
but we're still fighting against

1685
01:07:52,061 --> 01:07:54,550
ourselves and no golf.
You're competing,

1686
01:07:54,580 --> 01:07:56,620
you're still competing for the
championship.

1687
01:07:56,621 --> 01:07:58,360
There's no competing at the comedy
store.

1688
01:07:58,560 --> 01:07:59,141
I know,
I know.

1689
01:07:59,141 --> 01:08:01,000
But what I'm the world of standup comedy
today.

1690
01:08:01,001 --> 01:08:03,730
I think there's so many opportunities.
There's so many places to work.

1691
01:08:03,731 --> 01:08:05,830
So many stand when,
especially when you're doing the road,

1692
01:08:05,980 --> 01:08:08,320
there's so many theaters,
so many comedy clubs,

1693
01:08:08,380 --> 01:08:10,900
so many,
but there's still only 52 weeks in a

1694
01:08:10,900 --> 01:08:12,340
year.
Think about that.

1695
01:08:13,260 --> 01:08:15,140
I'm gonna fuck.
Does that mean how many headliners are

1696
01:08:15,141 --> 01:08:15,851
there in uh,
in,

1697
01:08:15,851 --> 01:08:17,050
in do you think?
You know,

1698
01:08:17,990 --> 01:08:18,823
300.

1699
01:08:20,690 --> 01:08:21,890
Not Joking.
I've.

1700
01:08:21,891 --> 01:08:23,630
Okay,
well then that's your case maybe

1701
01:08:23,631 --> 01:08:25,670
worldwide.
Well,

1702
01:08:25,720 --> 01:08:26,391
there's only.
Okay,

1703
01:08:26,391 --> 01:08:28,730
well then that is enough because there's
like how many,

1704
01:08:28,760 --> 01:08:30,020
how many do you think there are?
How many?

1705
01:08:30,021 --> 01:08:33,410
Like is there a 500?
There might be 500.

1706
01:08:33,480 --> 01:08:34,820
Well,
let me say that a club though,

1707
01:08:34,910 --> 01:08:38,460
there's only 52 weeks for the macbook
from one guy up,

1708
01:08:38,510 --> 01:08:41,510
but that's one club.
So you travel,

1709
01:08:41,511 --> 01:08:42,340
right?
There's,

1710
01:08:42,340 --> 01:08:44,390
there's fucking hundreds of cities.
Well,

1711
01:08:44,391 --> 01:08:45,500
I mean it's still,
it's still,

1712
01:08:45,740 --> 01:08:47,180
it's still a fight out there,
man,

1713
01:08:47,360 --> 01:08:50,030
to fuck all that thing for the good
weekends.

1714
01:08:50,710 --> 01:08:54,920
What we get July fourth weekend.
Those when we get is I get,

1715
01:08:54,921 --> 01:08:56,870
I get mother's Day,
Father's Day,

1716
01:08:57,140 --> 01:08:58,670
July fourth.
Dude.

1717
01:08:58,671 --> 01:09:00,440
I get those too.
I do those weekends.

1718
01:09:00,730 --> 01:09:01,740
Yeah.
You can't come.

1719
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:03,350
You're doing,
you're getting,

1720
01:09:03,351 --> 01:09:05,600
you're doing.
When's the last time you did a Thursday

1721
01:09:05,601 --> 01:09:06,434
night at a club?

1722
01:09:06,730 --> 01:09:09,140
I don't usually do Thursday night.
We go in the store.

1723
01:09:09,180 --> 01:09:11,420
What I'm saying you don't do it on
Thursday nights on the road.

1724
01:09:11,570 --> 01:09:15,700
Like road theatre is different,
but I'm saying like when you got,

1725
01:09:15,830 --> 01:09:19,250
there was a time when you got to a point
where you were doing Friday,

1726
01:09:19,250 --> 01:09:20,650
Saturday and you're out.
Yes.

1727
01:09:21,080 --> 01:09:22,240
At clubs,
clubs,

1728
01:09:22,470 --> 01:09:23,690
you know,
so there's still.

1729
01:09:23,720 --> 01:09:26,510
That was just because I just got tired
of the grind.

1730
01:09:26,880 --> 01:09:29,180
What,
what got me more than anything is doing

1731
01:09:29,181 --> 01:09:32,240
morning radio where you had to get up
early in the morning and then you try to

1732
01:09:32,241 --> 01:09:35,450
get some sleep and you never could and
then you just wrecked.

1733
01:09:35,570 --> 01:09:37,230
And then the only time he didn't get
right,

1734
01:09:37,250 --> 01:09:39,220
you're working.
It doesn't say that anymore,

1735
01:09:39,290 --> 01:09:41,480
but back in the day it did.
They still make you do it.

1736
01:09:41,810 --> 01:09:43,250
They're crazy.
They're crazy.

1737
01:09:43,251 --> 01:09:44,290
That's a waste of time,
you know?

1738
01:09:44,290 --> 01:09:47,920
And it's always the same thing as a guy
on his psychic.

1739
01:09:47,960 --> 01:09:50,150
It must work in some places.
I don't know.

1740
01:09:50,151 --> 01:09:52,060
I mean I'm talking out of my ass.
If I applied,

1741
01:09:52,220 --> 01:09:53,960
I sometimes I'm going to go on when I go
on stage ago,

1742
01:09:53,970 --> 01:09:57,870
go who heard me on the radio?
Who's here already know?

1743
01:09:57,890 --> 01:09:59,690
Meanwhile you were up at 5:00 in the
morning.

1744
01:09:59,780 --> 01:10:01,390
I'm up in Boston.
Yeah,

1745
01:10:01,550 --> 01:10:05,210
that's the thing is like if you don't
get good sleep and that's a problem with

1746
01:10:05,780 --> 01:10:08,420
doing three weekend,
three nights in a row in different

1747
01:10:08,421 --> 01:10:09,300
places.
When I it,

1748
01:10:09,310 --> 01:10:10,830
I just in New York,
I was just night.

1749
01:10:10,950 --> 01:10:12,750
You got to the third night.
Well,

1750
01:10:12,840 --> 01:10:15,020
three nights in a row.
If you're just encountering lines,

1751
01:10:15,230 --> 01:10:18,020
that's okay because you're getting up in
the morning in the same hotel room,

1752
01:10:18,290 --> 01:10:21,720
but when you get up and you have to go
to the airport and then fly under the

1753
01:10:21,721 --> 01:10:23,630
new price,
take a shower,

1754
01:10:23,660 --> 01:10:25,400
go to the gym,
try to wake up.

1755
01:10:26,030 --> 01:10:28,040
That's where it fucks you up.
Three nights in a row,

1756
01:10:28,041 --> 01:10:29,390
by the time the third night comes
around,

1757
01:10:29,391 --> 01:10:29,931
you're like,
damn,

1758
01:10:29,931 --> 01:10:31,640
I'm kind of worn the fuck out.
Well,

1759
01:10:31,730 --> 01:10:34,340
you just said something that's not even
a part of my thing.

1760
01:10:34,790 --> 01:10:35,670
Like you know,
you,

1761
01:10:35,700 --> 01:10:36,411
you,
you,

1762
01:10:36,411 --> 01:10:38,600
you,
you said like get up.

1763
01:10:38,960 --> 01:10:41,540
Go to the gym,
like I got an ad.

1764
01:10:41,541 --> 01:10:46,370
That ad that had that one man,
I fly somewhere.

1765
01:10:46,430 --> 01:10:49,610
If I fly in,
I put my bag down,

1766
01:10:49,850 --> 01:10:52,400
I unzip it,
I take my shorts out,

1767
01:10:52,401 --> 01:10:55,130
I put my fucking running shoes on or
whatever I'm going to where I go right

1768
01:10:55,131 --> 01:10:57,380
to the gym,
to the gym.

1769
01:10:57,381 --> 01:11:00,050
I don't fuck around because if I don't
I'm not going to do it.

1770
01:11:00,380 --> 01:11:01,400
I feel you.
If I'm.

1771
01:11:01,450 --> 01:11:04,070
If I'm standing in a nice hotel and you
have a 24 hour gym,

1772
01:11:04,071 --> 01:11:06,590
that's my favorite.
I'll just put my fucking headphones on

1773
01:11:06,591 --> 01:11:10,970
and just whatever they do in the gym,
get on a fucking elliptical machine and

1774
01:11:10,971 --> 01:11:12,740
do a half an hour.
Just make it.

1775
01:11:12,770 --> 01:11:14,100
Make it,
make yourself

1776
01:11:14,100 --> 01:11:15,460
sweat.
You know what I like to do,

1777
01:11:15,461 --> 01:11:18,720
and this is going to sound crazy,
but I love doing those like insanity.

1778
01:11:18,750 --> 01:11:21,780
Well that that's what I would fill that
spot with.

1779
01:11:22,550 --> 01:11:25,170
Check off.
I put my bag down,

1780
01:11:26,310 --> 01:11:29,280
take my shorts off,
get my one sock ready.

1781
01:11:31,070 --> 01:11:33,110
I never did that.
Does that

1782
01:11:34,700 --> 01:11:36,580
jerk off when you're shocked?
People were grossing.

1783
01:11:37,270 --> 01:11:42,260
This is supposed to simulate some sort
of like we'll see some sort of a,

1784
01:11:42,330 --> 01:11:45,600
some wooly pussy.
Pussy.

1785
01:11:46,440 --> 01:11:47,710
Let's see.
Was Silk Sock?

1786
01:11:47,750 --> 01:11:50,550
Yeah.
Even feels like you'll cut yourself.

1787
01:11:50,580 --> 01:11:52,560
But anyway,
like a flashlight with you on the road.

1788
01:11:52,561 --> 01:11:53,760
You're a creep?
Yeah,

1789
01:11:53,910 --> 01:11:57,540
mostly because the moment that they go
through your bag that they're at the

1790
01:11:57,541 --> 01:11:58,620
airport,
at the airport,

1791
01:11:58,621 --> 01:12:00,510
standing up.
Did that once right after nine slash 11.

1792
01:12:00,511 --> 01:12:02,880
He traveled with a briefcase.
No,

1793
01:12:02,881 --> 01:12:07,881
not a briefcase or a suitcase filled
with dildos and rubber fists and all

1794
01:12:08,311 --> 01:12:09,144
this shit.

1795
01:12:10,050 --> 01:12:14,220
Of course checked it everywhere anyway,
and that was why he was doing it.

1796
01:12:14,230 --> 01:12:16,890
They opened up his bag and like what is
this?

1797
01:12:18,380 --> 01:12:20,550
And they,
they can't say shit because sex toys

1798
01:12:20,551 --> 01:12:24,060
aren't outlawed.
Have you seen how crazy these sex robots

1799
01:12:24,061 --> 01:12:25,050
are looking?
Yes,

1800
01:12:25,390 --> 01:12:28,110
I have.
I mean I think we're,

1801
01:12:28,200 --> 01:12:30,060
you know,
how this feeling we have about

1802
01:12:31,770 --> 01:12:33,680
self driving cars.
There's a,

1803
01:12:33,780 --> 01:12:36,270
there's a fear out there about self
driving cars.

1804
01:12:36,271 --> 01:12:38,350
We're not there yet.
It's not going to be our generation to

1805
01:12:38,360 --> 01:12:40,350
fully embraces it.
Were 10,

1806
01:12:40,351 --> 01:12:42,660
15 years away from like,
this is going to be a normal thing.

1807
01:12:42,820 --> 01:12:45,390
Right.
Just the same thing with the sex dolls.

1808
01:12:45,540 --> 01:12:47,190
I think you're right.
When I see them,

1809
01:12:47,790 --> 01:12:50,580
I have a disconnect of like I can't.
I would never.

1810
01:12:51,010 --> 01:12:53,760
I just,
they just look.

1811
01:12:54,180 --> 01:12:57,900
You say that now,
but if it gets to like x Mokena style.

1812
01:12:57,930 --> 01:12:59,010
Oh,
well I mean jail.

1813
01:12:59,040 --> 01:13:04,040
That's come
to be self cleaning.

1814
01:13:06,840 --> 01:13:09,650
Lifesize sheep.
I googled sex robot sheep come pitch.

1815
01:13:09,660 --> 01:13:11,110
You got that bookmarked?
No.

1816
01:13:11,111 --> 01:13:11,944
Wait,
no.

1817
01:13:12,720 --> 01:13:13,200
Wait,
wait,

1818
01:13:13,200 --> 01:13:14,400
wait.
First of all,

1819
01:13:14,460 --> 01:13:16,860
is this one on the left for pedophiles?
I don't know.

1820
01:13:16,861 --> 01:13:19,770
It's.
I just typed in sex robot girl mannequin

1821
01:13:19,771 --> 01:13:21,400
was realistic features.
What?

1822
01:13:22,140 --> 01:13:25,020
Whoa.
That is creepy as hell.

1823
01:13:25,240 --> 01:13:28,020
I don't know about that one right there.
Did Jesus Christ.

1824
01:13:28,380 --> 01:13:31,830
That is creepy.
That one of the left was the one.

1825
01:13:31,831 --> 01:13:33,770
The real doll.
Fucking little kid.

1826
01:13:33,810 --> 01:13:34,830
Guess what I'm saying?
Yeah.

1827
01:13:34,831 --> 01:13:36,300
That is creepy as shit.
Well,

1828
01:13:36,301 --> 01:13:38,220
I guess that's one way to.
You know Jamie,

1829
01:13:38,250 --> 01:13:40,880
don't click on that display.
It's not a sex robot.

1830
01:13:40,890 --> 01:13:42,340
I don't know why it's popping up there
yet.

1831
01:13:42,360 --> 01:13:45,180
The why'd you click right on the crap?
Hold on a second,

1832
01:13:45,181 --> 01:13:48,330
but that's under,
but you did a sex robot and that's

1833
01:13:48,331 --> 01:13:51,300
what's coming up in.
The first thing is shop for a sex robot

1834
01:13:51,301 --> 01:13:53,850
on girl mannequin with realistic
features.

1835
01:13:54,120 --> 01:13:58,620
That's fucking gross
meat.

1836
01:13:58,650 --> 01:13:59,940
Harmony.
The sex robots.

1837
01:13:59,970 --> 01:14:02,060
Go to her.
Go downstairs.

1838
01:14:02,430 --> 01:14:04,260
That looks like at least a grown ass
woman.

1839
01:14:04,261 --> 01:14:06,360
Sex robots go fullscreen.
Nope.

1840
01:14:06,510 --> 01:14:09,350
Let me see this shit.
This is the one I've seen.

1841
01:14:10,090 --> 01:14:11,520
There's always some.
Well,

1842
01:14:11,530 --> 01:14:12,210
it looks like my phone

1843
01:14:12,210 --> 01:14:14,380
telling my God that's what she looks
like.

1844
01:14:14,860 --> 01:14:15,820
She looks that good.
Yeah,

1845
01:14:15,821 --> 01:14:16,840
we're getting there.
Oh,

1846
01:14:17,470 --> 01:14:19,960
just something.
Oh Wow.

1847
01:14:19,961 --> 01:14:21,340
Jesus.
That's how they want it to.

1848
01:14:21,341 --> 01:14:24,630
With the head cover.
Just to ask some weird.

1849
01:14:25,120 --> 01:14:27,040
Oh God.
That's even weird to look at that hole.

1850
01:14:27,041 --> 01:14:29,890
Where the neck is.
Jesus.

1851
01:14:29,891 --> 01:14:31,740
This is.
Yeah,

1852
01:14:31,840 --> 01:14:35,790
so the dam.
That is unbelievably lifelike though.

1853
01:14:35,791 --> 01:14:37,060
It's crazy.
Like,

1854
01:14:37,061 --> 01:14:38,890
come on man.
This is a scene in a science fiction

1855
01:14:38,891 --> 01:14:42,370
movie because this was like 1960 and
this is a science fiction movie.

1856
01:14:42,400 --> 01:14:44,850
Oh,
she can blink slowly and seductive.

1857
01:14:45,980 --> 01:14:49,140
Look at it because she's blinking lips.
I know.

1858
01:14:49,710 --> 01:14:52,150
I don't know.
Like if this was a science fiction movie

1859
01:14:52,300 --> 01:14:54,700
from like the 19 sixties and they had
this,

1860
01:14:54,790 --> 01:14:55,990
we'd be like,
whoa,

1861
01:14:56,020 --> 01:14:59,690
this is crazy.
Because it would be so far removed from

1862
01:15:00,090 --> 01:15:01,910
farfetch.
There's no way that this is going to

1863
01:15:01,911 --> 01:15:04,810
have a look at what they're doing,
but this is not far fetched.

1864
01:15:04,930 --> 01:15:07,040
This is close.
You know what?

1865
01:15:07,050 --> 01:15:11,620
I think that this is going to be
bypassed by his virtual reality,

1866
01:15:11,770 --> 01:15:14,960
like brain links or some sort of thing
where like you,

1867
01:15:14,961 --> 01:15:18,730
you can stimulate the mind in a way that
you think things are happening.

1868
01:15:19,060 --> 01:15:21,580
I think that's going to bypass all of
this technology.

1869
01:15:21,880 --> 01:15:23,710
I think it's going to be both,
but I think.

1870
01:15:23,830 --> 01:15:25,720
I think you're right that that's coming
too,

1871
01:15:25,780 --> 01:15:27,640
I think,
but I think this is coming to.

1872
01:15:27,790 --> 01:15:28,720
I think this,
this,

1873
01:15:28,990 --> 01:15:32,950
the ability to have like a real
realistic robot that'll fuck you.

1874
01:15:33,220 --> 01:15:35,980
That's not hard because you just think
about all the moves that it has to do.

1875
01:15:36,150 --> 01:15:38,230
Not a lot of moves.
I think you know,

1876
01:15:38,250 --> 01:15:39,970
also there'll be quiet,
you know,

1877
01:15:40,100 --> 01:15:42,940
you.
I think also a good thing if it's

1878
01:15:42,941 --> 01:15:46,540
possible is have a move.
Have a robot like that to practice

1879
01:15:46,541 --> 01:15:49,870
martial arts on,
like have a robot that throws punches

1880
01:15:49,871 --> 01:15:50,704
and kicks.

1881
01:15:51,120 --> 01:15:53,230
See now you're thinking about improving
society,

1882
01:15:53,231 --> 01:15:55,330
not just for sex.
So you can have a robot teach you to

1883
01:15:55,331 --> 01:15:57,900
play piano.
Teach you how to do like I'm just

1884
01:15:57,910 --> 01:15:59,680
talking about a robot that you can fuck
up.

1885
01:15:59,860 --> 01:16:02,210
Like leg kick you up.
You though body kick in.

1886
01:16:02,230 --> 01:16:04,090
It's not going to hurt training thing.
Yes,

1887
01:16:04,120 --> 01:16:04,953
yes.
Yeah,

1888
01:16:05,210 --> 01:16:06,820
it's totally possible.
Yeah.

1889
01:16:07,100 --> 01:16:09,160
Have it.
Like I'm a robot in there cooking.

1890
01:16:09,220 --> 01:16:10,180
How it doesn't,
you know,

1891
01:16:10,181 --> 01:16:13,330
it doesn't move quickly,
but it moves slowly so you can just work

1892
01:16:13,331 --> 01:16:16,450
on drills and shit is already have one.
Oh No,

1893
01:16:16,451 --> 01:16:16,791
no,
no,

1894
01:16:16,791 --> 01:16:17,501
don't.
No they don't.

1895
01:16:17,501 --> 01:16:19,390
Jamie,
this is just a fucking punching bag that

1896
01:16:19,391 --> 01:16:22,510
moves back and forth and stupid things
done.

1897
01:16:24,040 --> 01:16:27,550
Like that throws throws back at you.
I want to a person this is like,

1898
01:16:27,580 --> 01:16:30,120
but this is good for us.
Hyperextending elbows.

1899
01:16:30,460 --> 01:16:32,320
You're going to miss this thing and hurt
yourself.

1900
01:16:33,300 --> 01:16:35,350
I don't think that's a good idea.
Honestly.

1901
01:16:35,410 --> 01:16:39,340
I think you figured it out.
Your idea about having a of take instead

1902
01:16:39,341 --> 01:16:42,980
of having a sex robot,
that same technology used for fine arts

1903
01:16:43,270 --> 01:16:44,230
training.
Yeah,

1904
01:16:44,350 --> 01:16:46,720
because I have a dummy that I practice
Jiu Jitsu on,

1905
01:16:46,721 --> 01:16:49,210
but it's like this.
It's called a but dummy.

1906
01:16:49,390 --> 01:16:53,260
It just lays there like this and.
But I can practice armbars and

1907
01:16:53,261 --> 01:16:54,880
triangles.
I get reps on it.

1908
01:16:54,881 --> 01:16:55,990
I just don't call.
Right.

1909
01:16:56,140 --> 01:16:57,700
But it's not as good as doing it with a
person,

1910
01:16:57,701 --> 01:17:01,030
but it's hard to get a person to stand
there and let you do fucking choke them

1911
01:17:01,330 --> 01:17:02,570
over and over and over.
And I'm saying,

1912
01:17:02,800 --> 01:17:04,240
but a robot.
A robot could.

1913
01:17:04,300 --> 01:17:08,230
You could get us male sex doll.
You gotta order it specifically.

1914
01:17:08,231 --> 01:17:10,250
I want the sealed.

1915
01:17:10,580 --> 01:17:15,380
I want the Dick removed from mouth post.
I want to hold on.

1916
01:17:15,410 --> 01:17:16,243
Hold on,
hold on.

1917
01:17:17,270 --> 01:17:20,450
Why does the butthole need to be sealed?
So you don't want to be tempted?

1918
01:17:21,560 --> 01:17:26,560
Can accuse me of
it doesn't even work,

1919
01:17:26,601 --> 01:17:29,000
Bro.
Show you can take the gate off.

1920
01:17:29,490 --> 01:17:31,220
Joe.
Why does the butthole still work?

1921
01:17:33,650 --> 01:17:36,100
I specifically called and said,
no,

1922
01:17:36,280 --> 01:17:38,450
no.
Why is this cock so large?

1923
01:17:38,720 --> 01:17:43,340
Larger glistening.
Why does it smell like strawberry?

1924
01:17:43,341 --> 01:17:44,930
Yeah.
She'd always be dirty to here.

1925
01:17:44,931 --> 01:17:48,140
Yeah.
Why is your feed to couple of specks of

1926
01:17:48,141 --> 01:17:51,050
blood on it?
It shouldn't feel like it's been cleaned

1927
01:17:51,051 --> 01:17:55,610
and used.
You keep the plastic on it like a phone,

1928
01:17:55,611 --> 01:17:57,690
you know when you get your phone.
But those

1929
01:17:58,180 --> 01:18:01,820
real dolls,
they move like a real person like you.

1930
01:18:01,930 --> 01:18:04,920
If you didn't mind practicing on the
girl real doll,

1931
01:18:05,140 --> 01:18:08,020
you would order the girl real dog with
like small breasts,

1932
01:18:08,350 --> 01:18:10,510
you know,
so like the breast don't get in the way

1933
01:18:10,540 --> 01:18:14,200
and then you can work your mount,
get armbars in your triangles and then

1934
01:18:14,201 --> 01:18:16,220
when you're done you fucker.
Oh,

1935
01:18:16,250 --> 01:18:17,230
there you go.
There you go.

1936
01:18:17,560 --> 01:18:19,960
This was probably like dating,
you know?

1937
01:18:20,780 --> 01:18:22,390
No,
it's very different than dating.

1938
01:18:22,420 --> 01:18:24,120
Oh.
When you dated quite a few data,

1939
01:18:24,130 --> 01:18:26,200
UFC like do you think wanda rods,
the inner guide?

1940
01:18:26,201 --> 01:18:29,830
Do they have like they get excited like
that when they're like fighting each

1941
01:18:29,831 --> 01:18:30,790
other,
I doubt it.

1942
01:18:30,820 --> 01:18:32,180
Or they just stay away from that
completely.

1943
01:18:32,370 --> 01:18:34,650
I bet they do that,
but they don't even train together.

1944
01:18:34,690 --> 01:18:36,010
Well,
she's done fighting now.

1945
01:18:36,011 --> 01:18:38,020
She just does wwe,
which is great.

1946
01:18:38,080 --> 01:18:39,370
Yeah,
I think that's great for her.

1947
01:18:39,430 --> 01:18:40,263
Well,
she's great at it.

1948
01:18:40,360 --> 01:18:42,390
She's very good at it.
She's a decent,

1949
01:18:42,590 --> 01:18:44,170
decent enough actress.
She's an entertainer.

1950
01:18:44,380 --> 01:18:45,580
She's an entertainer.
Yeah,

1951
01:18:45,581 --> 01:18:47,250
and that's.
This is supposed to be anyway,

1952
01:18:47,251 --> 01:18:48,760
so I'll entertainment right?
It's like,

1953
01:18:48,761 --> 01:18:51,340
what is it for?
It's just to distract you and give you

1954
01:18:51,400 --> 01:18:54,940
something fun to watch.
But we're so close to Roman times where

1955
01:18:54,941 --> 01:18:56,310
like,
you know,

1956
01:18:56,320 --> 01:18:58,060
we want someone.
I mean,

1957
01:18:58,300 --> 01:19:00,910
you see that bare knuckle boxing event
they did this past weekend.

1958
01:19:00,911 --> 01:19:02,980
No Sec could,
I can't with that man.

1959
01:19:03,100 --> 01:19:05,380
I'm just not.
I just not into like watching violence

1960
01:19:05,381 --> 01:19:07,660
like that.
I didn't have a problem with it,

1961
01:19:08,630 --> 01:19:10,150
you know,
because they don't know why.

1962
01:19:10,180 --> 01:19:12,340
It's like,
like Mohammed Ali,

1963
01:19:12,970 --> 01:19:14,980
like how he was in his later in his
life.

1964
01:19:15,070 --> 01:19:17,230
I go,
why would anyone do this?

1965
01:19:17,580 --> 01:19:19,840
Even when I watched professional
athletes like,

1966
01:19:20,770 --> 01:19:22,990
oh my God,
this is what I'm saying.

1967
01:19:23,200 --> 01:19:23,980
Like I can't.

1968
01:19:23,980 --> 01:19:26,290
Wow.
They did it in Wyoming.

1969
01:19:26,740 --> 01:19:29,680
Legalized bare knuckle boxing.
That just looks horrible.

1970
01:19:30,010 --> 01:19:33,730
Well,
the idea is you can't hit people as hard

1971
01:19:33,731 --> 01:19:36,100
with bare knuckles,
so you're going to get cut up a little

1972
01:19:36,101 --> 01:19:37,570
bit,
but you're not.

1973
01:19:37,630 --> 01:19:39,580
You're not going to the same kind of
head trauma.

1974
01:19:39,610 --> 01:19:41,860
No one willing to do to.
No Man.

1975
01:19:41,861 --> 01:19:44,650
What about,
what's his name to hit a rudy Tom.

1976
01:19:44,651 --> 01:19:46,830
John of.
I don't know who that is.

1977
01:19:46,970 --> 01:19:51,460
The coach coach from Houston.
Remember when he was playing in the NBA

1978
01:19:51,890 --> 01:19:54,700
that they used to fight in the NBA in
the seventies.

1979
01:19:54,820 --> 01:19:58,420
They fist to fist fight.
They used to have real fights at.

1980
01:19:58,421 --> 01:20:01,300
Somebody's got 77,
got clocked in the head and he,

1981
01:20:01,301 --> 01:20:04,060
he broke his orbital bone.
So this like,

1982
01:20:04,120 --> 01:20:05,800
this was normal oil things,
man.

1983
01:20:05,910 --> 01:20:08,340
Let me say that they would just.
Oh,

1984
01:20:08,341 --> 01:20:09,870
you know what I'm talking about.
He found it.

1985
01:20:09,870 --> 01:20:13,770
See now you got to see the replay.
Yeah.

1986
01:20:14,100 --> 01:20:16,290
Cause he came,
you know,

1987
01:20:16,550 --> 01:20:19,080
so what's what's happening here.
It's hard to see what's going on.

1988
01:20:19,170 --> 01:20:22,350
Rudy comes and this guy clocks him in
the head.

1989
01:20:22,680 --> 01:20:24,620
Oh,
I was looking at the wrong dudes.

1990
01:20:24,630 --> 01:20:25,320
Yeah.
Yeah.

1991
01:20:25,320 --> 01:20:26,131
Watch.
Here he comes.

1992
01:20:26,131 --> 01:20:29,970
He's just coming in to like to like stop
the fight and this guy thought he was

1993
01:20:29,971 --> 01:20:32,930
coming at him and he's running right
towards that.

1994
01:20:32,940 --> 01:20:34,260
Ruined his career.
Did it?

1995
01:20:34,320 --> 01:20:36,970
Yes.
Well that's an orbital fracture and

1996
01:20:36,971 --> 01:20:39,300
that's real common in mma.
It happens all the time,

1997
01:20:39,360 --> 01:20:41,670
but like imagine with knuckles.
No,

1998
01:20:41,690 --> 01:20:44,820
I do you really think that that's not as
bad.

1999
01:20:44,821 --> 01:20:49,170
I'm telling you with gloves just as bad.
I can hit harder.

2000
01:20:49,171 --> 01:20:51,180
Trust me.
He can hit someone hard too because it

2001
01:20:51,181 --> 01:20:53,970
doesn't hurt your hands.
There's the gloves are not protecting

2002
01:20:54,030 --> 01:20:56,430
the opponent.
The gloves are protecting your hand.

2003
01:20:56,490 --> 01:20:58,380
Well,
I get that from doing this box because I

2004
01:20:58,381 --> 01:21:01,770
take my hand out these gloves and my
fucking fingers are killing me.

2005
01:21:01,810 --> 01:21:02,643
Right.
Take,

2006
01:21:02,670 --> 01:21:05,730
take no,
no gloves and go over to my heavy bag

2007
01:21:05,731 --> 01:21:08,460
because that heavy bag is stiff.
Go over and start punching that.

2008
01:21:09,380 --> 01:21:11,940
I get it.
Same with punching a person.

2009
01:21:11,970 --> 01:21:13,470
14 ounce or 16 ounce?
I don't.

2010
01:21:13,471 --> 01:21:15,180
I'm not sure which one,
how to feel,

2011
01:21:15,181 --> 01:21:17,160
but sometimes I went to 14 ounces.
I feel like,

2012
01:21:17,220 --> 01:21:18,720
oh,
this is a little more speed.

2013
01:21:18,750 --> 01:21:19,583
I got a little more.
Yeah,

2014
01:21:19,950 --> 01:21:22,410
two extra ounces.
Yes and yeah.

2015
01:21:22,620 --> 01:21:26,870
Well these are zero ounces hands move
very well.

2016
01:21:28,060 --> 01:21:29,890
And MMA there.
Four there.

2017
01:21:29,891 --> 01:21:30,750
Four ounce.
Oh,

2018
01:21:30,751 --> 01:21:34,170
I couldn't even listen.
That looked terrible.

2019
01:21:34,230 --> 01:21:36,390
Those guys' faces.
That can't be.

2020
01:21:36,710 --> 01:21:38,670
You could break someone's nose.
Dude.

2021
01:21:38,730 --> 01:21:41,490
Everybody's nose gets broken in the UFC.
Everybody,

2022
01:21:41,580 --> 01:21:43,610
everybody's face gets broken.
Orbital bone.

2023
01:21:43,620 --> 01:21:44,640
This is your world,
man.

2024
01:21:44,641 --> 01:21:45,840
I get it.
I hear you.

2025
01:21:45,841 --> 01:21:50,400
I turned the thing on and I hear your
voice and the other day I was on Fx.

2026
01:21:50,550 --> 01:21:52,530
I was like,
oh that's Joe Rogan and you're just

2027
01:21:52,531 --> 01:21:54,390
going in and you sound like a totally
different person.

2028
01:21:54,391 --> 01:21:55,870
It's crazy.
You get low.

2029
01:21:55,920 --> 01:21:57,800
Like you're like,
like you're,

2030
01:21:57,830 --> 01:22:00,720
you're in a whole different.
Like in that mode too,

2031
01:22:00,721 --> 01:22:02,130
you know,
you just sound like if it was like

2032
01:22:02,131 --> 01:22:03,600
rocky,
rocky movie,

2033
01:22:03,930 --> 01:22:05,910
you know,
and then you hear the announcers,

2034
01:22:05,930 --> 01:22:07,830
that's you right there.
You got it down man.

2035
01:22:09,970 --> 01:22:13,100
Well,
but doing it a long time to get us all.

2036
01:22:13,110 --> 01:22:15,090
But that's your world.
So I'm not trying to disrespect your

2037
01:22:15,091 --> 01:22:16,480
world,
but it's just too violent for me.

2038
01:22:16,800 --> 01:22:20,910
What you've seen with that punch.
That was 1977 and they probably didn't

2039
01:22:20,911 --> 01:22:23,970
know how to fix those things back then,
but now they know how to fix orbital

2040
01:22:23,971 --> 01:22:26,610
fractures and things along those lines.
Does that make it okay?

2041
01:22:27,060 --> 01:22:30,800
But I'm telling you it's not that guy
punched that guy with gloves on have

2042
01:22:30,820 --> 01:22:33,810
been just as bad as it was.
Boxing gloves,

2043
01:22:34,020 --> 01:22:35,880
boxing gloves.
He probably wouldn't have got hurt as

2044
01:22:35,881 --> 01:22:38,100
much because you're dealing with a big
thick,

2045
01:22:38,101 --> 01:22:39,510
heavy pad,
you know,

2046
01:22:39,540 --> 01:22:42,030
box goes eight,
10 ounces depending on the fight,

2047
01:22:42,570 --> 01:22:43,820
you know,
I'm just.

2048
01:22:43,860 --> 01:22:44,970
Yeah,
I know what you're saying.

2049
01:22:45,000 --> 01:22:50,000
It seems like it does,
but I didn't know that is what you get

2050
01:22:50,251 --> 01:22:51,600
mostly as cuts.

2051
01:22:51,990 --> 01:22:54,840
Like you see those guys were all cut up
because the knuckles,

2052
01:22:54,841 --> 01:22:59,841
the bare knuckles are hitting this.
Heres what I do this and I'm knocking on

2053
01:23:00,911 --> 01:23:01,860
it.
I just feel wow.

2054
01:23:01,861 --> 01:23:03,760
I just feel how that would be like,
oh man.

2055
01:23:04,650 --> 01:23:08,350
Well it's because a lot of people.
I was saying for the longest time you

2056
01:23:08,351 --> 01:23:12,130
shouldn't have even wraps on your hands
because it gives people an unrealistic

2057
01:23:12,131 --> 01:23:16,330
idea of what you could do with your
hands and why are there pads on your

2058
01:23:16,331 --> 01:23:18,310
knuckles when there's not pads on your
shins?

2059
01:23:18,311 --> 01:23:22,360
Are Pads on your knees or pads on your
pads and your elbow because you're

2060
01:23:22,361 --> 01:23:27,010
smashing people with elbows.
This is way more power that you can

2061
01:23:27,011 --> 01:23:31,090
generate hitting someone with an elbow
with a bear elbow than you can with a

2062
01:23:31,091 --> 01:23:34,870
bare fist because a bare fist,
if you hit someone in the forehead or

2063
01:23:34,871 --> 01:23:37,120
even in the cheek,
sometimes you break your hand.

2064
01:23:37,140 --> 01:23:38,350
Yeah,
not with the elbow.

2065
01:23:38,560 --> 01:23:41,770
The elbow.
You could hit foreheads and face.

2066
01:23:41,830 --> 01:23:44,830
You can hit everything good head.
But to,

2067
01:23:45,070 --> 01:23:46,970
it was a jamie.
I'm gonna.

2068
01:23:47,020 --> 01:23:49,690
Have you pull something up because I
sent this to shop.

2069
01:23:50,570 --> 01:23:52,270
Um,
there's something that.

2070
01:23:52,330 --> 01:23:55,300
Give me one second here and I'll find
this because,

2071
01:23:55,301 --> 01:23:57,040
uh,
Josh Emett,

2072
01:23:57,140 --> 01:24:00,280
see if he could find just google this.
Josh Emett details.

2073
01:24:00,281 --> 01:24:04,540
Hellish road back to health following
Jeremy Stevens Kao.

2074
01:24:04,541 --> 01:24:06,130
And then they find the stuff you got
over there.

2075
01:24:06,960 --> 01:24:11,680
This is Alpha brain.
It's a cognitive form,

2076
01:24:12,280 --> 01:24:13,620
just the limitless pill.
Motherfucker.

2077
01:24:14,740 --> 01:24:19,000
Motherfucking.
It actually tastes good after this.

2078
01:24:19,001 --> 01:24:20,680
Now for you,
we're gonna be talking about science and

2079
01:24:21,070 --> 01:24:23,230
so this dude,
I can't even open it.

2080
01:24:23,231 --> 01:24:25,410
I don't want to bite it and tear it
open.

2081
01:24:25,540 --> 01:24:29,830
That dude got k owed by Jeremy Stevens
who's like one of the most ruthless

2082
01:24:30,100 --> 01:24:34,720
knockout artists in the UFC and he's got
major facial fractures,

2083
01:24:35,140 --> 01:24:35,790
Major.

2084
01:24:35,790 --> 01:24:40,420
He his like orbital was fractured.
His cheek bone was fractured.

2085
01:24:40,421 --> 01:24:45,310
His nasal cavity was fractured,
like fucking everything is fractured and

2086
01:24:45,490 --> 01:24:49,510
he just had emergency surgery.
The second surgery,

2087
01:24:49,511 --> 01:24:54,460
he went to Orlando where the fight was
and they either misdiagnosed him or they

2088
01:24:54,461 --> 01:24:57,010
missed some of the injuries,
but he was still fucked up.

2089
01:24:57,040 --> 01:24:58,420
They didn't catch a lot of things.
He says,

2090
01:24:58,780 --> 01:25:03,730
and then he went to another doctor and
got an MRI and they immediately took him

2091
01:25:03,731 --> 01:25:04,391
into surgery.
Like,

2092
01:25:04,391 --> 01:25:06,400
dude,
this fucking whole head is broken.

2093
01:25:06,560 --> 01:25:09,000
That's what I'm saying.
I don't get it.

2094
01:25:09,010 --> 01:25:10,060
This is legal.
Here's my.

2095
01:25:10,120 --> 01:25:12,550
Have you bought yourself?
You find this stuff?

2096
01:25:12,580 --> 01:25:15,190
Not.
There was no mma fight and I kickbox and

2097
01:25:15,191 --> 01:25:17,220
I fought in a lot of taekwondo
tournament.

2098
01:25:17,250 --> 01:25:18,100
You know,
there's no,

2099
01:25:18,240 --> 01:25:20,740
there's nothing in you to know right
now.

2100
01:25:20,770 --> 01:25:23,140
I'm 50 years old.
The fuck am I doing doing that?

2101
01:25:23,210 --> 01:25:27,460
They got like a 42 and overleaf
don't.

2102
01:25:27,490 --> 01:25:29,170
But there are some guys that are in
their forties.

2103
01:25:29,171 --> 01:25:31,590
They still fight,
but it's just,

2104
01:25:31,591 --> 01:25:33,310
it's a young man,
a young man's game,

2105
01:25:33,311 --> 01:25:36,220
right?
It's also a young man's game because by

2106
01:25:36,221 --> 01:25:37,930
the time you're 40,
you got to think you've been doing it

2107
01:25:37,931 --> 01:25:40,030
for a long time,
which means you've been absorbing a lot

2108
01:25:40,031 --> 01:25:43,540
of punishment for a long time,
which means you're probably,

2109
01:25:43,780 --> 01:25:48,780
you should probably be done if you want
to live into your seventies and eighties

2110
01:25:50,081 --> 01:25:53,350
and be able to hold your bowels in and
know where your keys are.

2111
01:25:53,940 --> 01:25:56,200
You know,
there's a certain point in time we can't

2112
01:25:56,201 --> 01:25:59,630
get hit anymore.
Do you look at even other sports you've

2113
01:25:59,640 --> 01:26:01,000
noticed?
Have you ever seen these old basketball

2114
01:26:01,001 --> 01:26:02,140
players?
How he can't walk?

2115
01:26:02,230 --> 01:26:03,420
Yeah.
It's crazy.

2116
01:26:03,421 --> 01:26:04,460
Yeah.
It needs to get devastated.

2117
01:26:06,100 --> 01:26:08,060
They're like,
doc rivers,

2118
01:26:08,061 --> 01:26:09,850
I got clippers tickets,
so I'd see doc rivers,

2119
01:26:09,860 --> 01:26:11,600
he's on the sideline and he can't even.

2120
01:26:11,670 --> 01:26:14,570
It was also really tall guy and that,
that alone,

2121
01:26:14,600 --> 01:26:17,870
all those leverage points and all the
impact,

2122
01:26:17,900 --> 01:26:19,460
the constant.
Especially.

2123
01:26:19,970 --> 01:26:22,550
I mean a lot of these guys,
they didn't understand overtraining.

2124
01:26:22,551 --> 01:26:25,380
They overtrain they had injuries.
They just toughed it out and work

2125
01:26:25,381 --> 01:26:26,660
through them.
Know,

2126
01:26:26,661 --> 01:26:29,930
back injuries,
weird spinal issues.

2127
01:26:29,990 --> 01:26:33,410
That's why I think they should let every
professional athlete for like there's a

2128
01:26:33,410 --> 01:26:37,310
week period where they get to take some
steroids and recover a week.

2129
01:26:37,400 --> 01:26:38,710
You're just not enough.
Oh,

2130
01:26:38,730 --> 01:26:39,640
okay.
Oh you know,

2131
01:26:39,650 --> 01:26:42,680
but you'd have to be on a cycle.
You'd have to be on a cycle for six to

2132
01:26:42,681 --> 01:26:46,130
eight weeks.
So in the off season you get that six to

2133
01:26:46,131 --> 01:26:51,131
eight weeks of like that cream,
steroid cream and cryotherapy,

2134
01:26:51,680 --> 01:26:53,690
you know,
they can do the Cryo to get your body

2135
01:26:53,691 --> 01:26:58,220
like I agree with the doctor gives you,
the doctor gives regular people steroids

2136
01:26:58,221 --> 01:26:59,630
to recover from certain injuries.

2137
01:26:59,660 --> 01:27:01,410
Sure.
And then when paying these people there

2138
01:27:01,440 --> 01:27:04,790
to entertain us,
whether we should allow them to take a

2139
01:27:04,791 --> 01:27:05,750
moment to like,
okay,

2140
01:27:05,751 --> 01:27:09,380
well here's my six week period,
I'm going to get my steroids in and get

2141
01:27:09,381 --> 01:27:11,300
myself back to normal.
Then we'll start training camp.

2142
01:27:11,360 --> 01:27:13,970
I agree.
The problem is when you go on a cycle,

2143
01:27:13,971 --> 01:27:18,380
let's say if you want on steroids cycle,
your endocrine system shuts down and so

2144
01:27:18,381 --> 01:27:22,490
then when you go off the steroids,
your body has a normalization period.

2145
01:27:22,491 --> 01:27:25,520
And a lot of times,
I don't know the hard numbers,

2146
01:27:25,521 --> 01:27:28,950
but I think what they try to say is it's
50 percent of the time that you were on

2147
01:27:28,951 --> 01:27:31,070
the steroids.
So say if you're on steroids for three

2148
01:27:31,071 --> 01:27:33,560
months,
you would need a one and a half month

2149
01:27:33,620 --> 01:27:36,580
recovery period before your hormones
normalized.

2150
01:27:36,590 --> 01:27:39,350
Oh,
and sometimes you need help getting your

2151
01:27:39,351 --> 01:27:40,520
hormones to a normalized.

2152
01:27:40,530 --> 01:27:42,600
There's a bunch of things called
clomiphene.

2153
01:27:42,620 --> 01:27:45,500
There's a bunch of pitches.
Is that although also illegal stuff?

2154
01:27:45,560 --> 01:27:47,030
Yes.
All those are illegal.

2155
01:27:47,570 --> 01:27:49,010
There you go.
Depending on what.

2156
01:27:49,160 --> 01:27:51,050
You know what the regulations are,
what,

2157
01:27:51,150 --> 01:27:53,350
what sport you're in,
but in mma you went to other sports.

2158
01:27:53,351 --> 01:27:54,980
Do you watch football,
basketball and all that?

2159
01:27:55,010 --> 01:27:57,020
Are you just strictly.
I don't even know the rules.

2160
01:27:57,170 --> 01:27:59,160
I don't know what's happening.
When I watch a football game,

2161
01:27:59,190 --> 01:28:01,340
he literally a cave man.
Whistles.

2162
01:28:01,590 --> 01:28:02,720
I'm not.
I'm not.

2163
01:28:02,721 --> 01:28:04,580
I'm not.
I just don't have any room.

2164
01:28:04,581 --> 01:28:06,350
I look.
I watch professional pool.

2165
01:28:06,560 --> 01:28:07,160
Okay.
Okay.

2166
01:28:07,160 --> 01:28:08,420
You're one of those.
I got you.

2167
01:28:08,510 --> 01:28:10,110
I just love going to Canada.
You don't.

2168
01:28:10,130 --> 01:28:13,610
Every time I go to Canada and that
turned on their espn and Canada sneaker

2169
01:28:13,810 --> 01:28:15,100
and they got like,
they got the,

2170
01:28:15,710 --> 01:28:19,340
they got curling messed up where I go,
we would never show this bullshit.

2171
01:28:20,620 --> 01:28:21,860
Kappa.
Can I get a Kleenex?

2172
01:28:22,860 --> 01:28:24,410
Niggas alien.
We just ran out of.

2173
01:28:25,740 --> 01:28:26,573
Here you go.
Nasally.

2174
01:28:27,700 --> 01:28:29,910
Yeah.
So it's not that like I don't,

2175
01:28:29,990 --> 01:28:31,200
I'm a caveman.
It's just.

2176
01:28:31,580 --> 01:28:32,810
I like what?
Jesus.

2177
01:28:33,510 --> 01:28:36,240
Hey Sarah,
how are you doing that on mic?

2178
01:28:36,390 --> 01:28:38,040
We've got a big nose.
That microphone,

2179
01:28:40,000 --> 01:28:41,750
but yeah,
but you're blowing hard with that.

2180
01:28:41,850 --> 01:28:44,930
[inaudible].
You go deep son.

2181
01:28:45,050 --> 01:28:48,100
You just made people throw up those
people.

2182
01:28:48,110 --> 01:28:52,940
Listening to the funny of the fluid
coming out of people's noses is so vile

2183
01:28:52,980 --> 01:28:54,360
that sound,
you know,

2184
01:28:54,380 --> 01:28:56,690
like when someone like you on a
basketball court or something like that

2185
01:28:56,691 --> 01:28:58,550
and someone does a rocket.
Oh,

2186
01:28:58,890 --> 01:29:00,540
you see it like

2187
01:29:02,520 --> 01:29:04,890
this,
this from the guy that wants to watch

2188
01:29:04,891 --> 01:29:07,530
blood on people's face.
I don't want to watch blood on people's

2189
01:29:07,531 --> 01:29:09,150
face.
I just think that it would don't get it

2190
01:29:09,970 --> 01:29:11,640
stick.
You don't get a thrill out of when

2191
01:29:11,641 --> 01:29:14,160
somebody gets punched and then they turn
around and they're just like,

2192
01:29:14,190 --> 01:29:15,150
they're just like,
no,

2193
01:29:15,270 --> 01:29:18,840
I don't get a thrill out of that.
I get a thrill out of knockouts for

2194
01:29:18,841 --> 01:29:21,900
sure.
And which is worse guys hitting people

2195
01:29:22,170 --> 01:29:25,560
with big shots,
but it's like not specifically about

2196
01:29:25,561 --> 01:29:26,311
blood.
In fact,

2197
01:29:26,311 --> 01:29:29,670
I think I don't like blood because it
gets in the way and it stops.

2198
01:29:29,720 --> 01:29:30,900
Fight stops the fight.
Yeah.

2199
01:29:30,901 --> 01:29:33,270
That's the argument against elbows
actually said it.

2200
01:29:33,480 --> 01:29:34,800
Cut,
stopped good fights,

2201
01:29:34,801 --> 01:29:36,980
but they also knocked people.
Why don't you just throw that out?

2202
01:29:37,180 --> 01:29:40,840
Like garbage over there.
We had garbage and it's just fucking.

2203
01:29:40,890 --> 01:29:45,890
Just seeing it is like bothering you
right there.

2204
01:29:47,140 --> 01:29:52,020
Drop the double room.
Did sit on a table that's not trying to

2205
01:29:52,021 --> 01:29:56,280
get out.
It was like alien is.

2206
01:29:56,370 --> 01:29:59,850
I
had to get it out.

2207
01:29:59,851 --> 01:30:02,430
Sorry.
I don't know how we got from sex robots

2208
01:30:03,600 --> 01:30:04,920
was a circuitous path.

2209
01:30:07,160 --> 01:30:09,960
So what happens on this podcast?
Watched it a lot.

2210
01:30:10,020 --> 01:30:11,370
You don't go from like,
I'm like,

2211
01:30:11,380 --> 01:30:13,530
how'd they get there?
We don't even know.

2212
01:30:13,770 --> 01:30:15,840
We don't know what we.
Did you know how it got there?

2213
01:30:16,230 --> 01:30:19,140
Well I guess I should probably also
plugged my,

2214
01:30:19,141 --> 01:30:19,974
uh,
you know,

2215
01:30:20,280 --> 01:30:21,750
my new specials coming down.
Oh,

2216
01:30:22,200 --> 01:30:27,030
is that why you're here?
When is it coming out and the French at

2217
01:30:27,031 --> 01:30:27,690
home.
Get it.

2218
01:30:27,690 --> 01:30:31,020
June eighth on showtime.
American warrior.

2219
01:30:31,200 --> 01:30:34,530
I sent you a clip,
but I watched American warrior American.

2220
01:30:34,680 --> 01:30:36,430
Well with the American.
That is.

2221
01:30:36,510 --> 01:30:38,370
Eric is in the name of American.
Right.

2222
01:30:38,540 --> 01:30:40,170
And so I have,
I just spelled it with a k.

2223
01:30:40,200 --> 01:30:41,130
Oh,
American.

2224
01:30:41,580 --> 01:30:42,270
Oh.
I like,

2225
01:30:42,270 --> 01:30:42,990
oh,
look at that.

2226
01:30:42,990 --> 01:30:45,930
Americare on showtime.
Like it.

2227
01:30:46,080 --> 01:30:46,950
That's actually.
Ooh,

2228
01:30:46,951 --> 01:30:48,840
did that looks cool.
I like the background.

2229
01:30:48,841 --> 01:30:50,730
Where did you film that Shit?
In Portland,

2230
01:30:50,780 --> 01:30:53,370
at the Star Theater in Portland.
Oh Dude,

2231
01:30:53,520 --> 01:30:55,170
I love Portland.
Portland is great.

2232
01:30:55,410 --> 01:30:56,790
And this one,
my first special,

2233
01:30:56,791 --> 01:30:58,510
the ugly truth that I,
um,

2234
01:30:59,260 --> 01:31:03,420
I was talking about Kevin Christie.
True that for me.

2235
01:31:03,500 --> 01:31:05,400
Did he really,
isn't it fantastic.

2236
01:31:05,401 --> 01:31:06,270
Amazing.
Kevin.

2237
01:31:06,271 --> 01:31:09,060
So talented.
I wanted to be on a road and then like

2238
01:31:09,061 --> 01:31:11,730
have a chicken next to me with like
grenades on it,

2239
01:31:13,980 --> 01:31:15,730
you know what I mean?
Like we buy the chicken growth.

2240
01:31:18,360 --> 01:31:20,880
Yes.
That's a great picture though,

2241
01:31:20,881 --> 01:31:22,200
man.
That's just as he really.

2242
01:31:22,201 --> 01:31:25,050
He did a great job.
That looks amazing in this one.

2243
01:31:25,051 --> 01:31:27,270
I really go for it on this one man.
You know,

2244
01:31:27,271 --> 01:31:30,780
I'm talking about a ward show.
Protesting.

2245
01:31:30,781 --> 01:31:33,480
I'm talking about the kneeling for the
national anthem.

2246
01:31:33,510 --> 01:31:38,490
Me To tiger woods.
I'm going in on this in part.

2247
01:31:38,700 --> 01:31:40,500
So you're happy with it?
I am happy with it.

2248
01:31:40,510 --> 01:31:43,770
And think about like,
one thing that's weird about specials

2249
01:31:43,771 --> 01:31:45,180
now that,
that they have to be.

2250
01:31:45,680 --> 01:31:47,880
You could tell,
oh they filmed that a year ago or two

2251
01:31:47,881 --> 01:31:49,890
years ago and it's like we're not
allowed to like,

2252
01:31:50,210 --> 01:31:51,440
you know,
topical Shit,

2253
01:31:51,490 --> 01:31:53,820
do topical stuff.
And I feel like because there's so much

2254
01:31:53,821 --> 01:31:55,800
content out there right now,
it's like get it out there.

2255
01:31:55,801 --> 01:31:57,000
I want to know,
like for me,

2256
01:31:57,001 --> 01:31:59,500
like I want to know what Joe Rogan
thinks about,

2257
01:31:59,790 --> 01:32:01,210
you know,
the stuff that's going on,

2258
01:32:01,211 --> 01:32:02,970
I want to see you talk about it for 30
minutes on a,

2259
01:32:03,070 --> 01:32:04,180
on a national scale.

2260
01:32:04,300 --> 01:32:06,310
And we just don't do that.
And we got to do that now.

2261
01:32:06,340 --> 01:32:09,370
I think we should be doing that because
they're putting out stuff so fast

2262
01:32:09,371 --> 01:32:10,210
anyway.
Then it's like,

2263
01:32:10,211 --> 01:32:12,760
it's not like it's not special anymore.
If you need to stop calling them

2264
01:32:12,761 --> 01:32:16,420
specials special,
what is the name for them?

2265
01:32:16,421 --> 01:32:20,830
If they're not specials,
it should be like our conversations.

2266
01:32:21,070 --> 01:32:24,340
So this is Erik Griffin conversation
rolling stones don't put out a special

2267
01:32:24,400 --> 01:32:25,930
they put out,
they put out an album.

2268
01:32:27,000 --> 01:32:28,480
Like what did we did?
We put out a special.

2269
01:32:28,481 --> 01:32:32,080
They were special because it was only
five of them are year and you had to be

2270
01:32:32,081 --> 01:32:34,080
a giant to get one.
And it was like a.

2271
01:32:34,120 --> 01:32:35,180
and it was like,
um,

2272
01:32:35,560 --> 01:32:38,260
it was like a celebration of your career
and your fans.

2273
01:32:38,261 --> 01:32:39,670
It was like,
I've made it,

2274
01:32:39,820 --> 01:32:43,360
here's this,
so your fans could go yo to not fans.

2275
01:32:43,540 --> 01:32:45,190
Come watch this.
This guy is really funny.

2276
01:32:45,250 --> 01:32:48,280
And you now we're introducing four of
them in a career,

2277
01:32:48,310 --> 01:32:51,460
a career.
This is my second one now.

2278
01:32:53,280 --> 01:32:55,660
Nobody saw the first one.
You know what I mean?

2279
01:32:55,661 --> 01:32:57,280
So the first one,
wasn't that long ago,

2280
01:32:57,740 --> 01:32:58,451
10 years ago?
No,

2281
01:32:58,451 --> 01:33:00,520
it was last year.
It came out last year,

2282
01:33:00,521 --> 01:33:02,830
but I taped it two years ago,
year before.

2283
01:33:02,860 --> 01:33:05,260
So it took a year to come out.
It took a year to come out because they

2284
01:33:05,261 --> 01:33:07,990
wanted it to come out with the show.
I'm dying up here.

2285
01:33:07,991 --> 01:33:11,290
Sundays on showtime.
They wanted it to come out with the

2286
01:33:11,291 --> 01:33:12,670
show.
And so the same thing happened this

2287
01:33:12,670 --> 01:33:13,290
year.
Like I'm dying.

2288
01:33:13,290 --> 01:33:14,380
Appears out,
you know?

2289
01:33:14,470 --> 01:33:17,120
And if someone doesn't have showtime,
can they watch it on?

2290
01:33:17,640 --> 01:33:20,230
Can eventually they'll be able to.
But you know,

2291
01:33:20,231 --> 01:33:21,970
it's one of those shows.
Yeah,

2292
01:33:22,090 --> 01:33:26,290
you get to showtime anytime at showtime
anytime and yeah,

2293
01:33:26,291 --> 01:33:28,390
you could watch it there and I just
think that we need to.

2294
01:33:28,390 --> 01:33:30,250
I,
I want to hear with all this stuff

2295
01:33:30,251 --> 01:33:33,490
that's been going on,
especially with trump and the trump era,

2296
01:33:33,750 --> 01:33:35,990
I imagine like,
you see what he said today,

2297
01:33:36,230 --> 01:33:38,310
what he thinks he can pardon himself
too.

2298
01:33:38,311 --> 01:33:41,800
There's always.
He wrote pardon?

2299
01:33:41,801 --> 01:33:43,600
In all caps.
Hardened himself.

2300
01:33:43,930 --> 01:33:46,510
Pardon?
In all caps in all caps.

2301
01:33:46,511 --> 01:33:47,344
He wrote.
Pardon?

2302
01:33:47,730 --> 01:33:49,900
Like this is like,
like we did this.

2303
01:33:50,140 --> 01:33:51,040
Well,
people did it.

2304
01:33:51,041 --> 01:33:52,900
I did do it.
I voted for Gary Johnson.

2305
01:33:52,901 --> 01:33:54,490
He was on my podcast.
I voted for him.

2306
01:33:54,810 --> 01:33:56,770
What I'm saying,
you will say,

2307
01:33:56,771 --> 01:33:59,290
well that's a vote for trump.
Really in this day and age,

2308
01:33:59,350 --> 01:34:02,660
how dare you say not because it's
California and California went for

2309
01:34:02,920 --> 01:34:04,510
Clinton anyway,
but um,

2310
01:34:04,900 --> 01:34:07,390
because the coral Chia,
but by the way,

2311
01:34:07,391 --> 01:34:09,430
if they took,
if they got rid of the electoral college

2312
01:34:09,570 --> 01:34:12,130
and the Republican candidate would come
to California,

2313
01:34:12,340 --> 01:34:15,040
they'd go up to northern California and
they'd get 10,

2314
01:34:15,041 --> 01:34:16,930
15 million votes for them.

2315
01:34:16,930 --> 01:34:18,250
Anyway.
So northern,

2316
01:34:18,640 --> 01:34:21,640
northern California,
so anything between San Francisco and,

2317
01:34:21,910 --> 01:34:25,450
and you know all the way down the five
to come into here too,

2318
01:34:25,750 --> 01:34:27,520
not just northern California,
cause people think in northern

2319
01:34:27,521 --> 01:34:31,200
California as being like San Francisco.
But no,

2320
01:34:31,230 --> 01:34:31,550
no,
no.

2321
01:34:31,550 --> 01:34:36,550
Those hours driving above San Francisco,
drive for eight hours and still be in

2322
01:34:36,551 --> 01:34:37,420
California.
Yeah.

2323
01:34:37,520 --> 01:34:42,280
That's how it is a day drive.
If you go from Mexico all the way up to

2324
01:34:42,281 --> 01:34:43,600
Oregon,
it's a day it,

2325
01:34:43,620 --> 01:34:45,550
these people that live on the east coast
and Midwest,

2326
01:34:45,750 --> 01:34:46,200
they,
you know,

2327
01:34:46,200 --> 01:34:47,560
they,
they turn in two hours,

2328
01:34:47,561 --> 01:34:49,440
they go through four states,
you know what I mean?

2329
01:34:49,441 --> 01:34:51,370
When they have it,
it's not us man over here.

2330
01:34:51,371 --> 01:34:54,490
And that's what's tough to.
Well that's why they want to change into

2331
01:34:54,491 --> 01:34:56,570
like three California.
So you heard that shit.

2332
01:34:56,660 --> 01:34:58,970
They don't want to do that shit.
They're talking about putting on the

2333
01:34:58,971 --> 01:34:59,510
ballot.

2334
01:34:59,510 --> 01:35:02,630
Poor state.
It wouldn't be good because la would

2335
01:35:02,631 --> 01:35:03,930
have all the fucking button.
Yeah.

2336
01:35:04,180 --> 01:35:05,660
You know,
I mean it would be la,

2337
01:35:05,661 --> 01:35:08,260
San Francisco and then farmers.
Yeah.

2338
01:35:08,350 --> 01:35:10,070
If you may just want to get with it will
be another.

2339
01:35:10,100 --> 01:35:12,530
What would they do that,
what would that do to the electoral

2340
01:35:12,531 --> 01:35:15,440
votes?
To the question like we have 55 now,

2341
01:35:15,470 --> 01:35:19,210
so then it would be like what?
Like the main epicenter where?

2342
01:35:19,220 --> 01:35:21,680
Well,
wherever there's urban ethnic people

2343
01:35:21,681 --> 01:35:22,710
though,
they're going to not.

2344
01:35:22,770 --> 01:35:27,410
They're going to draw those.
Jamie California is the fifth largest

2345
01:35:27,411 --> 01:35:31,910
economy in the world and the world.
Jesus Christ.

2346
01:35:32,150 --> 01:35:32,841
Yeah.
Take that.

2347
01:35:32,841 --> 01:35:37,490
Or Gwyneth eat out the whole of the UK.
We beat out the United Kingdom.

2348
01:35:37,990 --> 01:35:39,840
United Kingdom is Scotland too,
right?

2349
01:35:40,070 --> 01:35:41,730
That's not just England.
Scotland.

2350
01:35:41,960 --> 01:35:43,760
Who else is it?
Is it Ireland?

2351
01:35:43,910 --> 01:35:46,280
Is that the UK?
Christ.

2352
01:35:47,300 --> 01:35:51,620
So the rents up big fucking place.
Isn't it like 20 percent of the entire

2353
01:35:51,621 --> 01:35:53,630
population of the United States live in
California?

2354
01:35:54,350 --> 01:35:57,940
Thirteen percent or something like that.
Something silly like one and we don't

2355
01:35:57,950 --> 01:36:00,460
know the real numbers.
I thought it was way more than that.

2356
01:36:00,461 --> 01:36:02,660
It's a little bit less than.
I thought it was more before.

2357
01:36:02,661 --> 01:36:04,940
I thought they think there's 20 million
people here.

2358
01:36:04,970 --> 01:36:08,300
I don't think they're fucking counting.
Did you ever get.

2359
01:36:08,360 --> 01:36:10,190
Does anybody count you?
Did you get counted?

2360
01:36:10,960 --> 01:36:14,020
The counters ain't counting anybody
that,

2361
01:36:14,270 --> 01:36:15,890
especially all the people that are here
illegally.

2362
01:36:15,920 --> 01:36:17,840
How many people do you know that are
here illegally?

2363
01:36:17,960 --> 01:36:19,620
I don't know too many people that are
here illegally.

2364
01:36:19,630 --> 01:36:21,350
I didn't know a lot of people that were
Canadian.

2365
01:36:21,730 --> 01:36:23,890
Bougie.
Now that I'm not even around people that

2366
01:36:24,130 --> 01:36:25,040
were were,
where would they be?

2367
01:36:25,041 --> 01:36:26,690
They don't.
We don't run the same circles.

2368
01:36:27,770 --> 01:36:29,330
Actually,
the lady that cleans my house,

2369
01:36:29,331 --> 01:36:34,331
she might be illegal
to

2370
01:36:36,150 --> 01:36:39,590
department to Department or do you know?
I don't have a house yet.

2371
01:36:39,590 --> 01:36:40,301
I'm saving.
I'm just.

2372
01:36:40,301 --> 01:36:41,450
I just.
I'm weird about it.

2373
01:36:41,451 --> 01:36:46,400
I'm just moved because I always feel
like this job I'm in now is the last job

2374
01:36:46,401 --> 01:36:47,930
I'll ever have and I'm going to need my
money.

2375
01:36:48,020 --> 01:36:49,280
Well,
let me stop you right there.

2376
01:36:49,281 --> 01:36:51,620
You're a funny dude and he's always
going to do well,

2377
01:36:51,710 --> 01:36:53,780
but I still don't want to.
I want to get the house.

2378
01:36:53,781 --> 01:36:55,640
I want that.
I'm going to get the house I want to die

2379
01:36:55,641 --> 01:36:56,870
in.
Do you have a podcast?

2380
01:36:56,930 --> 01:36:58,810
No,
I don't have time to get a pass to the

2381
01:36:58,811 --> 01:37:00,110
next thing.
I'm working on it.

2382
01:37:00,230 --> 01:37:03,170
To what you're good at this.
You'd be perfect at it.

2383
01:37:03,190 --> 01:37:04,150
I know I'm gonna,
you know,

2384
01:37:04,151 --> 01:37:05,180
we'll be.
We'll be competing.

2385
01:37:05,181 --> 01:37:06,980
Right.
See,

2386
01:37:06,981 --> 01:37:09,380
I have everybody on my podcast and
people that.

2387
01:37:09,420 --> 01:37:11,840
I mean supposedly competing,
but I want them to do well.

2388
01:37:11,841 --> 01:37:13,550
I think there's enough out there for
everybody.

2389
01:37:13,550 --> 01:37:16,460
I really do.
I think that this is about people's own

2390
01:37:16,461 --> 01:37:21,110
personal time anyway when they listen to
your podcast and then they listened to

2391
01:37:21,111 --> 01:37:24,050
the next one.
It's not like it's like it's not live

2392
01:37:24,051 --> 01:37:25,670
anymore.
Nothing's live anymore.

2393
01:37:25,671 --> 01:37:28,580
That's true.
I don't even know when my favorite

2394
01:37:28,581 --> 01:37:29,450
shows.
Come on.

2395
01:37:29,480 --> 01:37:33,470
I just put them in the queue and then I
watch him all my shows come on on Sunday

2396
01:37:33,471 --> 01:37:35,300
night.
That's how I look at it because that's

2397
01:37:35,301 --> 01:37:37,160
when I watch TV.
Yeah,

2398
01:37:37,161 --> 01:37:39,950
that's a.
that's a unique thing and most of the

2399
01:37:39,951 --> 01:37:43,580
shit I watched these days is on Netflix.
So it's all streaming.

2400
01:37:43,730 --> 01:37:45,800
Yeah.
What a juggernaut they are.

2401
01:37:46,280 --> 01:37:50,020
I don't think it's sustainable.
Can't be sustainable because so.

2402
01:37:50,030 --> 01:37:50,691
Well,
yeah,

2403
01:37:50,691 --> 01:37:54,930
but here's the thing.
If I drop $60,000,000 on,

2404
01:37:55,320 --> 01:37:59,250
I dropped $60 million to make a project
and you watch it in 10 hours,

2405
01:37:59,510 --> 01:37:59,880
then you're.

2406
01:37:59,880 --> 01:38:00,930
Then you're like,
hey,

2407
01:38:00,960 --> 01:38:02,490
um,
what's next?

2408
01:38:03,150 --> 01:38:04,230
The.
I bet you.

2409
01:38:04,231 --> 01:38:07,020
I guarantee you in a couple of years
Netflix is going to stop this.

2410
01:38:07,440 --> 01:38:10,590
The whole show comes out in one sitting.
They're gonna probably do it in chunks.

2411
01:38:10,740 --> 01:38:12,060
Why would they do that?
Because you want,

2412
01:38:12,330 --> 01:38:16,540
you anticipate anticipation.
What it does to your brain,

2413
01:38:16,560 --> 01:38:18,760
to the board room.
As soon as you walk out of this mine,

2414
01:38:18,790 --> 01:38:19,740
I'd be like,
fire them.

2415
01:38:19,860 --> 01:38:21,540
No ma'am.
He's retarded.

2416
01:38:21,570 --> 01:38:23,400
They're spending.
Have any idea what he's talking about.

2417
01:38:23,580 --> 01:38:25,170
Dope.
Anticipation.

2418
01:38:25,200 --> 01:38:29,460
Psychologically feels just as good as
actual achieving the thing.

2419
01:38:29,670 --> 01:38:34,140
That anticipation you feel like waiting
to see what happens next week you're on

2420
01:38:34,141 --> 01:38:38,280
a showtime show.
This motherfucker right here.

2421
01:38:38,281 --> 01:38:41,730
I'll see what's going on.
You're trying to like justify being on a

2422
01:38:41,731 --> 01:38:44,770
showtime show.
Good thing that they come out of.

2423
01:38:45,240 --> 01:38:48,480
It is a good thing.
It's a good thing you can bitch at the

2424
01:38:48,480 --> 01:38:51,330
end of the season for before engine
would.

2425
01:38:51,410 --> 01:38:54,810
You could still be shit,
but this model obviously is uber

2426
01:38:54,811 --> 01:38:57,330
successful like one of the most
successful things ever.

2427
01:38:57,360 --> 01:38:59,430
Then why are they talking about they're
losing money all the time.

2428
01:38:59,460 --> 01:39:01,800
What are you talking about?
The article about?

2429
01:39:01,801 --> 01:39:03,510
Look it up.
Netflix and losing money.

2430
01:39:03,511 --> 01:39:07,880
Netflix made hundreds of millions of
subscribers.

2431
01:39:07,890 --> 01:39:10,620
Know what they put out?
Pay $10 a month there.

2432
01:39:10,680 --> 01:39:14,940
They make more money than anybody,
but then also putting out money.

2433
01:39:14,941 --> 01:39:19,070
If they're given standup comics,
$20,000,000 to make special standup

2434
01:39:19,080 --> 01:39:22,050
comics.
What they put out 52 specials.

2435
01:39:22,140 --> 01:39:24,880
Even if they.
Let's say they paid 100,000,

2436
01:39:24,940 --> 01:39:27,050
which I know they didn't.
They paid way more than that for each of

2437
01:39:27,051 --> 01:39:28,500
them.
That's still a lot of money right there,

2438
01:39:28,501 --> 01:39:29,910
man.
I like how you didn't even bother.

2439
01:39:30,230 --> 01:39:32,130
I didn't want to $50 million.

2440
01:39:34,980 --> 01:39:38,310
I'm the worst at doing simple math in my
head.

2441
01:39:38,520 --> 01:39:43,520
I'm like 500 bucks to 25.
What is that fifth?

2442
01:39:44,180 --> 01:39:46,560
A lot of money.
It's a lot of money.

2443
01:39:46,580 --> 01:39:49,050
Dammit.
They May.

2444
01:39:49,060 --> 01:39:51,280
Stranger things.
Stranger things is an expensive show.

2445
01:39:51,310 --> 01:39:53,550
God damn good.
Show that people watch it in one week.

2446
01:39:53,551 --> 01:39:55,590
It's over there,
but then you're saying as a netflix

2447
01:39:55,591 --> 01:39:56,191
person,
hey,

2448
01:39:56,191 --> 01:39:57,060
what's next?
Yeah,

2449
01:39:57,061 --> 01:39:59,790
but millions people watch it.
Net Week.

2450
01:40:00,110 --> 01:40:03,090
No,
those people are justifying that $10 a

2451
01:40:03,091 --> 01:40:05,010
month that they spend.
That's when they have their contacts

2452
01:40:05,610 --> 01:40:08,210
constantly coming in.
It has to keep that really close to

2453
01:40:08,211 --> 01:40:12,180
suppress surpassing Disney's valuation.
Do you know how crazy that is?

2454
01:40:12,600 --> 01:40:14,520
Netflix.
Netflix special by the way,

2455
01:40:14,521 --> 01:40:16,590
in 2005.
Oh Shit.

2456
01:40:16,591 --> 01:40:18,120
Yeah,
I didn't have the original was.

2457
01:40:18,180 --> 01:40:21,360
Oh gees on you.
You'd have $20,000,000 though.

2458
01:40:22,010 --> 01:40:25,560
Well,
I'm happy that that's showing you that

2459
01:40:25,561 --> 01:40:28,800
you're incorrect.
Now netflix is making shit tons of

2460
01:40:28,801 --> 01:40:29,090
money.

2461
01:40:29,090 --> 01:40:30,690
Know.
Just because they're valuable doesn't

2462
01:40:30,691 --> 01:40:32,730
mean that they're making a profit and
taking on debt.

2463
01:40:32,731 --> 01:40:34,500
So like they're playing a.
it's business.

2464
01:40:34,530 --> 01:40:38,910
So.
But how much are they making uber?

2465
01:40:38,970 --> 01:40:42,780
Uber's evaluation was,
I think they took on like another 8

2466
01:40:42,780 --> 01:40:43,440
million area.
Excuse me.

2467
01:40:43,440 --> 01:40:46,740
$8,000,000,000 in debt.
What does that mean though when I do

2468
01:40:46,741 --> 01:40:48,780
that,
but is it based on their earnings?

2469
01:40:48,810 --> 01:40:52,410
Like because they aren't they making
billions of dollars a year and they're

2470
01:40:52,411 --> 01:40:54,020
making money.
Then they took on more debt.

2471
01:40:54,021 --> 01:40:56,560
So they just have reinvested it back
into the company like they're not really

2472
01:40:56,590 --> 01:40:59,140
interested in turning a profit.
Maybe for 2017,

2473
01:40:59,141 --> 01:41:00,820
they're looking more into like 20,
25.

2474
01:41:00,850 --> 01:41:03,370
That's what I'm talking about man.
Do you know what you're saying?

2475
01:41:03,430 --> 01:41:05,580
Did you guess it's not sustainable?
Do it.

2476
01:41:05,590 --> 01:41:07,600
Hold on a second.
But how much do they make?

2477
01:41:07,601 --> 01:41:10,660
Let's find out instead of just guessing.
Not that I didn't give a fuck,

2478
01:41:10,661 --> 01:41:13,000
but obviously it does because he's so
invested in showtime.

2479
01:41:13,120 --> 01:41:17,040
Fuck this guy's model of.
What is showtime due to you at that

2480
01:41:17,041 --> 01:41:19,800
time?
I saw you a Netflix special that I did

2481
01:41:19,810 --> 01:41:22,570
in 2005.
We actually sold to showtime since I got

2482
01:41:22,571 --> 01:41:24,910
the rights to it.
And then are you going back to Netflix?

2483
01:41:24,930 --> 01:41:29,130
Give one of them licensing deals,
licensing deal.

2484
01:41:29,170 --> 01:41:30,370
Just going to.
I don't know what it's going to be.

2485
01:41:30,400 --> 01:41:33,640
I don't know.
My first special I did with rooftop,

2486
01:41:33,670 --> 01:41:37,210
which was now owned by Amazon,
so I think you can get.

2487
01:41:37,211 --> 01:41:38,840
The audio is good.
You can get the audio on.

2488
01:41:38,860 --> 01:41:43,150
I think Amazon's going to buy Netflix.
Watch what showtime has done for fucking

2489
01:41:43,151 --> 01:41:46,060
Sebastian.
I'm is not a bad place to

2490
01:41:48,120 --> 01:41:50,740
be if showtime wants to be in the air
griffin business.

2491
01:41:50,741 --> 01:41:51,760
I'm all about it.
Yeah,

2492
01:41:51,820 --> 01:41:52,750
no,
I hear you man.

2493
01:41:52,870 --> 01:41:55,000
You know showtimes great.
I'm actually wrong.

2494
01:41:55,001 --> 01:41:58,090
So my special comes out on Friday,
but only 10 minutes at a time.

2495
01:41:58,120 --> 01:42:03,120
So the next week
you'd be in the middle of a bit and

2496
01:42:04,660 --> 01:42:06,580
think about bill cosby.
Don't,

2497
01:42:06,581 --> 01:42:09,160
don't tune in next week.
Hey,

2498
01:42:09,161 --> 01:42:14,161
that might be the new model man.
American war episode too.

2499
01:42:16,470 --> 01:42:18,880
You've got to come up with dude,
you got to come up with some kind of

2500
01:42:18,881 --> 01:42:20,860
gimmicks.
It's like there's so many specials out

2501
01:42:20,861 --> 01:42:22,060
there.
Just keep swinging.

2502
01:42:22,180 --> 01:42:24,370
That's what I'm doing.
It's just me on stage.

2503
01:42:24,490 --> 01:42:26,650
There's no skits in the front or the
back end.

2504
01:42:26,651 --> 01:42:27,850
Good.
There's none of that shit.

2505
01:42:27,880 --> 01:42:32,170
It's just you just walk on snow.
Somebody introducing me who shit is just

2506
01:42:32,171 --> 01:42:34,330
walking on stage and that's how you
doing it.

2507
01:42:34,331 --> 01:42:36,940
So it just turns on.
Walk on stage.

2508
01:42:37,180 --> 01:42:38,410
Okay.
That's going to be the next one.

2509
01:42:38,440 --> 01:42:40,320
No introduction.
I did introduction last time,

2510
01:42:40,370 --> 01:42:44,770
like that's a waste of time because
especially when you have to cut it down.

2511
01:42:45,160 --> 01:42:47,100
I had to cut out nine minutes.
Oh,

2512
01:42:47,120 --> 01:42:48,820
it's tricky.
Right minutes.

2513
01:42:48,880 --> 01:42:51,390
People don't understand how long.
Nine minutes is on a.

2514
01:42:51,520 --> 01:42:52,990
on a.
for comedy.

2515
01:42:53,200 --> 01:42:54,970
Yeah.
That's a long ass time.

2516
01:42:54,971 --> 01:42:57,160
So I was shooting babies.
Manage you film.

2517
01:42:57,610 --> 01:42:59,050
I did twice.
Twice as good.

2518
01:42:59,570 --> 01:43:00,670
I,
if I had to do it again,

2519
01:43:00,700 --> 01:43:02,680
I would want to do a four times.
That's what I do.

2520
01:43:02,681 --> 01:43:05,830
And I would take the two second shows me
the one.

2521
01:43:06,110 --> 01:43:07,160
Hm.
You know.

2522
01:43:07,330 --> 01:43:12,130
Well I did four last time at San
Francisco.

2523
01:43:12,131 --> 01:43:14,500
My last one and this one in Boston.
I did for two.

2524
01:43:14,530 --> 01:43:16,180
What you got for money,
you know what I mean?

2525
01:43:16,290 --> 01:43:18,760
Yeah.
You got to pay more for money,

2526
01:43:19,030 --> 01:43:20,830
but you know what?
For me it was like,

2527
01:43:20,870 --> 01:43:21,703
uh,
no,

2528
01:43:21,820 --> 01:43:24,910
you want to be loose.
And because of that I was looser in the

2529
01:43:24,911 --> 01:43:29,020
first show I've ever been because I knew
I didn't just think I had two barrels

2530
01:43:29,040 --> 01:43:30,720
mile.
I was tight as fuck.

2531
01:43:30,721 --> 01:43:34,310
And my first show here in crowd was
portland,

2532
01:43:34,380 --> 01:43:37,030
you know,
so it's like these liberal pretentious

2533
01:43:37,060 --> 01:43:39,850
white people talking about.
I'm talking about all kinds of.

2534
01:43:39,880 --> 01:43:40,713
It was,
man,

2535
01:43:41,280 --> 01:43:43,060
you have to own it when you talk about
this stuff,

2536
01:43:43,061 --> 01:43:44,650
you've got to own it.
You do have to own it.

2537
01:43:44,780 --> 01:43:46,300
Unapologetic.
Alright.

2538
01:43:46,430 --> 01:43:49,540
That's how you have to do it.
So the second show was so loosey Goosey

2539
01:43:49,541 --> 01:43:50,770
and you know,
I thought,

2540
01:43:50,771 --> 01:43:52,520
I thought,
I think I captured something here.

2541
01:43:52,610 --> 01:43:57,610
Diaz Portland's an interesting place
because it's free liberal to the point

2542
01:43:58,341 --> 01:44:01,790
where they go so far left that they're
like militant in a way.

2543
01:44:01,920 --> 01:44:02,301
Yeah,
yeah.

2544
01:44:02,301 --> 01:44:03,950
Yeah.
But had a great time there,

2545
01:44:03,951 --> 01:44:04,580
man.
I was,

2546
01:44:04,580 --> 01:44:06,380
I had a great time there.
Last time I was there,

2547
01:44:06,381 --> 01:44:08,810
I was like six months ago.
I fucking loved it.

2548
01:44:08,870 --> 01:44:13,040
Do you find it like out there,
it's in this trump era.

2549
01:44:13,160 --> 01:44:17,120
I find a comedy has been challenging.
It's differently.

2550
01:44:17,150 --> 01:44:20,850
It's not just the trump era.
It's the era of outrage.

2551
01:44:20,851 --> 01:44:21,220
Yes,
yes,

2552
01:44:21,220 --> 01:44:24,800
yes.
But what I'm saying is I find that trump

2553
01:44:24,801 --> 01:44:27,650
people are angry winters,
you know,

2554
01:44:28,340 --> 01:44:29,150
they're angry winters.

2555
01:44:29,150 --> 01:44:33,230
Like you won your guys in office,
the globe glow and then like you say

2556
01:44:33,231 --> 01:44:34,490
anything and they're just like,
fuck.

2557
01:44:35,160 --> 01:44:37,610
If you say anything bad about trump,
it's crazy.

2558
01:44:37,670 --> 01:44:40,730
I have to fucking come.
They come hard and I don't get it.

2559
01:44:40,760 --> 01:44:41,840
I get it.
That's your guy.

2560
01:44:42,340 --> 01:44:43,670
That's your guy.
That's your guy.

2561
01:44:43,671 --> 01:44:47,480
Get it in the assholes.
Assholes have never been represented

2562
01:44:47,481 --> 01:44:49,630
before.
For Real.

2563
01:44:49,640 --> 01:44:51,860
I don't know.
I think there's no for real at a few

2564
01:44:51,860 --> 01:44:54,790
minutes.
Politician who's overly assholeishness.

2565
01:44:55,150 --> 01:44:56,480
Yeah,
he's definitely.

2566
01:44:57,290 --> 01:44:58,490
What happens when has that ever
happened?

2567
01:44:58,880 --> 01:45:03,280
Never,
and I'm a very stable genius causing

2568
01:45:03,680 --> 01:45:07,160
something stable.
Genius to that tweet is his dark where

2569
01:45:07,161 --> 01:45:09,680
he says,
I have every right to pardon and all

2570
01:45:09,681 --> 01:45:14,150
letters in all capital letters myself.
I looked at that this morning.

2571
01:45:14,770 --> 01:45:19,100
I got sick to my stomach,
a little guy that does it know how to do

2572
01:45:19,101 --> 01:45:24,101
the job and it's not his fault that he
was given the job like,

2573
01:45:25,490 --> 01:45:26,330
well,
he was.

2574
01:45:26,620 --> 01:45:27,740
He went after it.
I know,

2575
01:45:27,741 --> 01:45:32,741
but he said it's not his fault.
He was the best candidate in the

2576
01:45:33,170 --> 01:45:34,640
Republican Party,
like they should be the one that should

2577
01:45:34,641 --> 01:45:38,540
be ashamed of themselves.
I was watching the Trevor Noah's show

2578
01:45:38,541 --> 01:45:40,970
and he was showing this clip of trump at
a rally.

2579
01:45:40,971 --> 01:45:43,100
This is not.
He's already won and he's up there

2580
01:45:43,101 --> 01:45:44,060
saying,
you know,

2581
01:45:44,061 --> 01:45:45,520
I uh,
uh,

2582
01:45:45,521 --> 01:45:45,960
I,
they,

2583
01:45:45,960 --> 01:45:48,470
they told me to say drained the swamp,
right?

2584
01:45:48,620 --> 01:45:50,390
I didn't like it.
He's saying this,

2585
01:45:50,650 --> 01:45:52,340
I didn't like that,
but they said it would work.

2586
01:45:52,341 --> 01:45:53,810
It would stay like he's,
he,

2587
01:45:53,850 --> 01:45:57,920
he even has contempt for the people that
believed the bullshit that he was

2588
01:45:57,921 --> 01:46:00,080
saying.
He has contempt for them by just going

2589
01:46:00,081 --> 01:46:00,760
like,
you know,

2590
01:46:00,760 --> 01:46:04,010
I said these things just to get elected.
And it worked.

2591
01:46:04,430 --> 01:46:07,730
And like these other people,
they just were horrible candidates.

2592
01:46:07,850 --> 01:46:08,980
Kevin,
Christine.

2593
01:46:10,040 --> 01:46:11,450
And so he was Chris,
Chris,

2594
01:46:11,510 --> 01:46:11,870
Chris.

2595
01:46:11,870 --> 01:46:12,510
I said,
Kevin,

2596
01:46:12,510 --> 01:46:13,940
Krista.
He was on my mind,

2597
01:46:14,060 --> 01:46:16,370
the guy that drew might be awesome
artists,

2598
01:46:16,390 --> 01:46:18,350
the awesome artists.
So you know,

2599
01:46:18,560 --> 01:46:20,060
Kevin is right now listening to this
going,

2600
01:46:20,061 --> 01:46:24,400
what the fuck do I know?
Run for office shit.

2601
01:46:24,570 --> 01:46:26,460
I don't know.
I'm just fucking here.

2602
01:46:26,500 --> 01:46:29,540
So why wouldn't you be an asshole?
Why wouldn't he be like a sore winner?

2603
01:46:29,840 --> 01:46:32,240
You know what I mean?
I get it,

2604
01:46:32,300 --> 01:46:37,010
but it's the age of outrage and this is
what we're seeing from this Roseanne.

2605
01:46:37,011 --> 01:46:38,240
Stuff like,
dude,

2606
01:46:38,241 --> 01:46:42,260
I've been called a racist more times
over the last few days for defending

2607
01:46:42,261 --> 01:46:44,510
Rosanne,
saying that I know her,

2608
01:46:44,630 --> 01:46:47,600
she's mentally ill and then she's on all
kinds of pills.

2609
01:46:47,601 --> 01:46:48,930
I don't think she's a racist.
I,

2610
01:46:49,110 --> 01:46:51,290
and I'm going to say this too.
I think that this is a.

2611
01:46:51,300 --> 01:46:54,900
just because you can doesn't mean you
should situation.

2612
01:46:55,380 --> 01:46:58,530
Can I tweet something inappropriate?

2613
01:46:59,010 --> 01:47:01,320
Of course you can.
Should you,

2614
01:47:01,500 --> 01:47:05,970
when you have all of these things that
you're responsible for.

2615
01:47:06,200 --> 01:47:07,980
Sure.
You're the lead of a show,

2616
01:47:08,760 --> 01:47:11,430
your show,
a family show.

2617
01:47:11,910 --> 01:47:15,720
You're on a family network.
You have a lot of people's jobs that are

2618
01:47:15,721 --> 01:47:19,230
depending on you and I think there was
just an error in judgment.

2619
01:47:19,260 --> 01:47:20,400
Oh,
100 percent I do.

2620
01:47:20,401 --> 01:47:22,230
I think that she's a racist.
I think that.

2621
01:47:22,260 --> 01:47:26,870
I think that if she had just called the
woman just ugly and,

2622
01:47:27,100 --> 01:47:28,770
and,
and talked about her,

2623
01:47:29,190 --> 01:47:31,740
her job,
what would this have been?

2624
01:47:31,741 --> 01:47:33,200
The same thing,
but you,

2625
01:47:33,201 --> 01:47:34,330
you add,
you know,

2626
01:47:34,410 --> 01:47:37,560
it's like if you call somebody a bitch,
okay,

2627
01:47:37,650 --> 01:47:39,450
there's a pro.
You people can have a problem with that.

2628
01:47:39,630 --> 01:47:43,710
You call somebody a black bitch and all
of a sudden that changes it.

2629
01:47:44,220 --> 01:47:44,790
No.
Yeah.

2630
01:47:44,790 --> 01:47:46,620
If you call somebody a black monkey
bitch,

2631
01:47:46,650 --> 01:47:47,431
then you're like,
okay,

2632
01:47:47,431 --> 01:47:49,160
where's this coming from?
Well,

2633
01:47:49,170 --> 01:47:54,170
perfect example is Samantha bee calling
Ivanka trump affectless cunt,

2634
01:47:54,240 --> 01:47:56,400
and she said it on TV.

2635
01:47:57,260 --> 01:48:00,380
She sent me that was prepared.
Like someone wrote that out as a part of

2636
01:48:00,381 --> 01:48:02,750
her monologue.
She said it on television and then they

2637
01:48:02,751 --> 01:48:03,550
apologized.
She's like,

2638
01:48:03,550 --> 01:48:06,470
ah,
should just set it and tbs like we're

2639
01:48:06,471 --> 01:48:09,650
good,
but the advertisers are not good.

2640
01:48:09,651 --> 01:48:13,130
They're pulling out left and right,
but here's the thing with Rosanne,

2641
01:48:13,790 --> 01:48:15,680
she's not.
Well,

2642
01:48:15,950 --> 01:48:19,250
this is a fact.
Like I know I've talked to her.

2643
01:48:19,251 --> 01:48:21,470
She's told me.
I've talked to other people who know

2644
01:48:21,471 --> 01:48:23,120
her.
I talked to people who worked with her.

2645
01:48:23,390 --> 01:48:26,480
She's mentally ill,
but it talks openly about it.

2646
01:48:26,560 --> 01:48:30,050
She does well on a second.
She's on a host of medications.

2647
01:48:30,200 --> 01:48:33,350
She's on antidepressants.
She's on Ambien,

2648
01:48:33,440 --> 01:48:35,690
she's drinking,
she's smoking pot.

2649
01:48:35,780 --> 01:48:38,270
She's 66 years old.
She's not,

2650
01:48:38,480 --> 01:48:40,610
she's not well.
She smoked cigarettes.

2651
01:48:40,611 --> 01:48:43,940
She's out of it like she's got real
mental issues.

2652
01:48:43,941 --> 01:48:48,941
Now here's the thing.
If she had problems with her lungs and

2653
01:48:49,220 --> 01:48:52,190
she was smoking cigarettes and coughing
up blood,

2654
01:48:52,340 --> 01:48:55,460
what would and and doing stupid shit
like trying to run marathons.

2655
01:48:55,580 --> 01:48:56,660
When people go,
hey,

2656
01:48:56,661 --> 01:48:58,620
you know what the fuck is wrong with
you?

2657
01:48:58,760 --> 01:49:00,170
You know,
you think you could run a marathon,

2658
01:49:00,171 --> 01:49:01,820
what do you,
you will you fucking stupid?

2659
01:49:01,880 --> 01:49:03,380
No,
they wouldn't because they'd go,

2660
01:49:03,381 --> 01:49:04,580
oh,
she's got an illness.

2661
01:49:04,670 --> 01:49:07,100
This is why she can't run.
This is why she's coughing up blood.

2662
01:49:07,220 --> 01:49:10,250
She's got a mental illness.
She's mentally ill.

2663
01:49:10,340 --> 01:49:12,200
This is a fact.
That's why she's on so many different

2664
01:49:12,201 --> 01:49:14,900
medications,
but she has mental illness.

2665
01:49:15,980 --> 01:49:18,210
What if you were starting to get
mentally ill?

2666
01:49:18,450 --> 01:49:22,470
Are you saying that like saying like
sort of overtly racist things?

2667
01:49:22,471 --> 01:49:22,980
First of all,
she did.

2668
01:49:22,980 --> 01:49:23,030
You should

2669
01:49:23,030 --> 01:49:25,820
know that lady was black though.
Have you ever seen that woman?

2670
01:49:25,940 --> 01:49:28,940
She does not look black.
She thought that lady was Jewish when

2671
01:49:28,941 --> 01:49:30,890
she said planet of the Apes.
She said it because of her haircut

2672
01:49:30,920 --> 01:49:32,900
because she looks like that lady from
the planet of the apes.

2673
01:49:33,350 --> 01:49:35,900
She swear she swears and she swear to me
on the phone.

2674
01:49:35,930 --> 01:49:37,280
This is her exact word.
She goes,

2675
01:49:37,460 --> 01:49:41,300
I would never fucking say that you think
I'm so stupid that I would call black

2676
01:49:41,301 --> 01:49:42,620
lady planet of the Apes.
She goes,

2677
01:49:42,621 --> 01:49:44,480
I thought she was Jewish.
She goes,

2678
01:49:44,481 --> 01:49:46,730
look at her.
She doesn't look black or that makes it

2679
01:49:46,731 --> 01:49:48,060
okay,
doesn't.

2680
01:49:48,100 --> 01:49:49,570
But she's,
she's Jewish too.

2681
01:49:49,571 --> 01:49:50,271
I mean,
that was the other thing.

2682
01:49:50,271 --> 01:49:51,041
Someone said,
well look,

2683
01:49:51,041 --> 01:49:51,520
she did.
She did.

2684
01:49:51,520 --> 01:49:53,920
She did this.
She dressed up like Hitler and had jus

2685
01:49:53,921 --> 01:49:55,630
cookies and she was bacon and back in
the day.

2686
01:49:55,930 --> 01:49:57,580
Yeah,
she's a shitster by the way.

2687
01:49:57,581 --> 01:49:59,140
She's also Jewish.
You know,

2688
01:49:59,141 --> 01:50:00,880
I think she gets a free pass on doing
that,

2689
01:50:01,070 --> 01:50:03,710
but I think that when you make a
mistake,

2690
01:50:03,800 --> 01:50:05,600
this is what's missing from our society
now.

2691
01:50:05,690 --> 01:50:08,990
She made a mistake.
You should be allowed to apologize for

2692
01:50:08,991 --> 01:50:11,990
that mistake.
Live with the shame and then you move

2693
01:50:11,991 --> 01:50:14,000
on.
But what we're trying to do now is

2694
01:50:14,001 --> 01:50:17,810
remove people from society altogether.
Like,

2695
01:50:17,811 --> 01:50:19,910
I don't want to like sit.
I'm not going to like,

2696
01:50:19,970 --> 01:50:23,030
there's,
we're not going to excuse her behavior.

2697
01:50:23,060 --> 01:50:24,730
We're not even going to say that there's
a,

2698
01:50:24,860 --> 01:50:26,510
you know,
a reason.

2699
01:50:27,230 --> 01:50:29,810
Whatever the reason is,
all the mental illness and all this kind

2700
01:50:29,811 --> 01:50:31,520
of stuff,
it's still a mistake.

2701
01:50:31,610 --> 01:50:34,580
What happened?
She's well enough to work on a

2702
01:50:34,581 --> 01:50:37,820
television show,
so I'm saying she made this mistake and

2703
01:50:37,821 --> 01:50:41,300
I'm not with.
I'm not with saying that she's a racist

2704
01:50:41,301 --> 01:50:42,800
either because when I.
even when I read that,

2705
01:50:42,801 --> 01:50:47,570
I thought as A.
I'm just saying as a comic we say things

2706
01:50:48,020 --> 01:50:51,870
that a regular person that is going to
translate the math into like,

2707
01:50:51,890 --> 01:50:55,220
well this is because you don't like
black people or women or you don't like

2708
01:50:55,221 --> 01:50:57,460
Jews you don't like,
and that's not how we operate.

2709
01:50:57,480 --> 01:50:59,960
Just trying to be fun.
We just trying to be funny and I think

2710
01:50:59,961 --> 01:51:04,250
that she comes from an error where this
is what you would say to be funny and

2711
01:51:04,251 --> 01:51:05,570
biting.
Yeah,

2712
01:51:05,630 --> 01:51:07,160
and I think that when she looked back on
it,

2713
01:51:07,220 --> 01:51:08,210
she went,
oh,

2714
01:51:08,450 --> 01:51:11,450
I didn't know this person was black.
Now the people out there listening,

2715
01:51:11,540 --> 01:51:12,740
you couldn't believe it or not,

2716
01:51:13,180 --> 01:51:16,270
but at the same time,
the Susan Rice comment from a long time

2717
01:51:16,271 --> 01:51:17,770
ago,
it was way worse because she.

2718
01:51:17,800 --> 01:51:22,090
Susan Rice is clearly black and she did
a comment a long time ago.

2719
01:51:22,091 --> 01:51:26,560
I think it was 2013,
but she said Susan Rice is a man with

2720
01:51:26,561 --> 01:51:29,800
giant swinging eight balls.
That's what she said.

2721
01:51:30,050 --> 01:51:35,050
Now that is way worse.
That's way worse and that is a woman who

2722
01:51:35,281 --> 01:51:37,030
is clearly black.
I mean,

2723
01:51:37,031 --> 01:51:38,140
you look at Susan Rice,
there's.

2724
01:51:38,300 --> 01:51:41,110
She's not racially ambiguous at all.
This other woman,

2725
01:51:41,111 --> 01:51:42,550
Valerie,
I don't know her name,

2726
01:51:42,580 --> 01:51:43,960
Gerrit,
she's.

2727
01:51:44,170 --> 01:51:47,410
She's got straight hair.
She's got light complexion.

2728
01:51:47,411 --> 01:51:49,060
She's a tone.
It's all about intent though,

2729
01:51:49,100 --> 01:51:50,190
what you're talking about,
right,

2730
01:51:50,200 --> 01:51:53,470
but it's what her intent was to be
funny.

2731
01:51:53,740 --> 01:51:58,120
She is obviously not,
but first of all she was drunk and on

2732
01:51:58,121 --> 01:52:00,340
Ambien.
Ambien is a cla.

2733
01:52:00,670 --> 01:52:02,770
Hamilton Morris sent me an email about
this.

2734
01:52:02,771 --> 01:52:05,620
He was explaining it to me and then I
talked to a sleep therapist about it.

2735
01:52:06,310 --> 01:52:07,280
There.
There's a,

2736
01:52:07,470 --> 01:52:11,830
a type of drug that ambient is,
that's called a hypnotic,

2737
01:52:12,280 --> 01:52:16,960
and this is one of the reasons why
Ambien has so many weird side effects

2738
01:52:16,961 --> 01:52:18,950
associated with it.
Um,

2739
01:52:19,300 --> 01:52:22,810
my friend Kevin James,
Kevin James got up in the middle of the

2740
01:52:22,811 --> 01:52:24,070
night.
I cooked a meal,

2741
01:52:24,490 --> 01:52:27,520
went to bed,
got up in the morning and uh,

2742
01:52:27,550 --> 01:52:30,130
he had like his wife.
I confronted him like,

2743
01:52:30,131 --> 01:52:31,990
did you do that because I didn't fucking
do that.

2744
01:52:32,170 --> 01:52:33,250
And she,
and she's like,

2745
01:52:33,251 --> 01:52:34,390
no,
the foods in the trash,

2746
01:52:34,420 --> 01:52:35,231
like,
you cooked it,

2747
01:52:35,231 --> 01:52:35,980
you ate it.
He's like,

2748
01:52:35,980 --> 01:52:38,020
I did not,
I did not eat that.

2749
01:52:38,260 --> 01:52:38,861
And she's like,
okay,

2750
01:52:38,861 --> 01:52:40,130
if you didn't do it,
who did?

2751
01:52:40,300 --> 01:52:43,120
And he had to like come to grips with
the fact that he was on Ambien.

2752
01:52:43,240 --> 01:52:45,440
He got up,
cooked a meal for himself,

2753
01:52:45,500 --> 01:52:47,810
had no recollection of it.
Went back to sleep.

2754
01:52:47,930 --> 01:52:50,840
My mom was on Ambien.
She got up in the middle of the night

2755
01:52:51,020 --> 01:52:54,410
and drew on the shag carpet.
She had a white shag carpet in a

2756
01:52:54,411 --> 01:52:58,100
bathroom with lipstick and with,
with nail Polish,

2757
01:52:58,160 --> 01:52:59,660
like a little kid.
She goes,

2758
01:52:59,661 --> 01:53:01,680
I don't remember doing it at all.
She is.

2759
01:53:01,730 --> 01:53:05,300
It's scary shit.
I know a bunch of people that have had

2760
01:53:05,301 --> 01:53:08,750
weird experiences on that stuff,
but if you stay in somebody's house and

2761
01:53:08,751 --> 01:53:12,560
you were on Ambien and you messed up
their shag carpet,

2762
01:53:12,800 --> 01:53:16,310
you'd apologize to apologize for it,
but this is what I'm saying.

2763
01:53:16,311 --> 01:53:21,311
When they may be say she's also.
She's also drunk on antidepressants,

2764
01:53:23,040 --> 01:53:26,000
which you're not supposed to be,
and then she smoking pot,

2765
01:53:26,001 --> 01:53:28,190
which I'm sure you're probably not
supposed to do either when you're on

2766
01:53:28,191 --> 01:53:30,650
those things,
and she's an older lady who just got off

2767
01:53:30,651 --> 01:53:33,620
of an exhausting schedule that almost
she in her words,

2768
01:53:33,621 --> 01:53:34,454
almost killed her.

2769
01:53:34,640 --> 01:53:36,770
She was.
She had bronchitis when she was filming.

2770
01:53:36,950 --> 01:53:38,760
I'm saying,
she's not doing well.

2771
01:53:39,360 --> 01:53:41,570
She made a fucked up mistake and she
apologized,

2772
01:53:41,571 --> 01:53:43,550
but everybody wants a berry.
Herman and I,

2773
01:53:43,551 --> 01:53:45,620
and I'm not with that.
I'll tell you with you.

2774
01:53:45,621 --> 01:53:48,410
It's like you can't that,
but that's the society that we live in

2775
01:53:48,411 --> 01:53:51,230
right now that's dislike.
Jumped outrage right now.

2776
01:53:51,250 --> 01:53:53,090
What will be,
not just outraged,

2777
01:53:53,091 --> 01:53:56,690
but we want to end your career.
Like why do we want to end someone's

2778
01:53:56,691 --> 01:53:59,390
career for fucking up?
Like it's one thing,

2779
01:53:59,420 --> 01:54:03,470
like here's the thing,
like if she was not mentally ill,

2780
01:54:03,530 --> 01:54:07,280
there was nothing wrong with her.
Like say if someone from.

2781
01:54:07,550 --> 01:54:11,510
Let's just pick a sitcom theory.
Let's say the guy for Stevie,

2782
01:54:11,810 --> 01:54:16,190
stevie still what's on tv right now
because Devi Devi that a different type

2783
01:54:16,191 --> 01:54:18,360
of TV.
A guess on CBS or just beginning?

2784
01:54:18,370 --> 01:54:20,210
It's a new one that's on TV.

2785
01:54:20,390 --> 01:54:23,900
What's a new one?
Like if either one of these guys will

2786
01:54:23,901 --> 01:54:25,940
have to do anymore.
They don't have any anymore.

2787
01:54:26,780 --> 01:54:27,830
It's Big Bang theory stolen.
Oh,

2788
01:54:27,831 --> 01:54:28,520
it is?
Okay.

2789
01:54:28,520 --> 01:54:29,480
Alright.
Big Bang theory.

2790
01:54:29,670 --> 01:54:32,600
If that is a pretty blonde girl in the
Big Bang theory.

2791
01:54:32,601 --> 01:54:37,601
I don't know what if that girl gets on
TV and she's or she gets on twitter and

2792
01:54:38,031 --> 01:54:42,110
she says something totally racist.
Throw some n bombs,

2793
01:54:42,330 --> 01:54:42,831
you know,
like,

2794
01:54:42,831 --> 01:54:44,330
and there's nothing wrong with her.
She's like,

2795
01:54:44,331 --> 01:54:47,060
this is just how I feel.
And then they come after and they go,

2796
01:54:47,061 --> 01:54:49,520
well fuck this bitch.
She shouldn't be on television.

2797
01:54:49,640 --> 01:54:52,670
She's racist.
She doesn't represent how America views

2798
01:54:52,730 --> 01:54:56,360
people in 2018.
She's archaic.

2799
01:54:56,450 --> 01:54:58,600
Get her off the fucking air.
This is what this is.

2800
01:54:58,640 --> 01:55:01,220
You can't get away with this anymore.
This is the 19 twenties.

2801
01:55:01,490 --> 01:55:04,520
This is 2018.
That would be acceptable.

2802
01:55:04,521 --> 01:55:05,300
I understand that.

2803
01:55:05,300 --> 01:55:09,050
If you found a real hateful person,
she secretly has like a swastika tattoo

2804
01:55:09,051 --> 01:55:11,180
somewhere and she's.
She's an evil person.

2805
01:55:11,450 --> 01:55:13,640
This is not the case with Rosanne.
This is just not.

2806
01:55:13,641 --> 01:55:17,300
It's just not the case.
She's an older lady who's mentally

2807
01:55:17,301 --> 01:55:21,920
disturbed and on a fucking host of
competing medications for her

2808
01:55:21,921 --> 01:55:22,820
consciousness.
Well,

2809
01:55:22,821 --> 01:55:25,400
that should be the reason why she needs
help.

2810
01:55:25,430 --> 01:55:26,810
That yeah,
we've got to get her some help,

2811
01:55:26,870 --> 01:55:29,930
but he's a crazy thing is like she was
America's sweetheart just a couple of

2812
01:55:29,931 --> 01:55:30,480
weeks ago.
Now.

2813
01:55:30,480 --> 01:55:34,720
I know now fucking.
That's how quickly everybody hates is

2814
01:55:34,721 --> 01:55:38,010
how quickly and people are calling me a
racist for saying what I said right

2815
01:55:38,011 --> 01:55:38,844
there.
This is not.

2816
01:55:38,900 --> 01:55:42,640
This is not an unusual thing in our
society like we this code.

2817
01:55:42,641 --> 01:55:45,510
This is very much reminds me of the
Salem witch hunt,

2818
01:55:45,980 --> 01:55:47,850
you know,
this is the same kind of thing a little

2819
01:55:47,851 --> 01:55:48,000
bit.

2820
01:55:48,000 --> 01:55:48,421
Right?
You know,

2821
01:55:48,421 --> 01:55:49,870
it's like the scarlet letter,
like how,

2822
01:55:49,871 --> 01:55:52,710
how old does the scarlet letter and
we're still doing that now.

2823
01:55:52,800 --> 01:55:53,480
Theism.
Yeah,

2824
01:55:53,480 --> 01:55:54,950
right.
This is something that we're.

2825
01:55:54,960 --> 01:55:56,250
We're,
we're prone to it.

2826
01:55:56,640 --> 01:55:59,700
Do you think it's because people are
scared that they're going to get called

2827
01:55:59,701 --> 01:56:02,100
out on it themselves,
so when they see someone who's doing

2828
01:56:02,101 --> 01:56:04,290
something wrong to go after him,
attack them with everything,

2829
01:56:04,291 --> 01:56:06,860
they have to almost to divert any sort
of.

2830
01:56:07,030 --> 01:56:09,240
Because people are scared that people
are going to turn on them.

2831
01:56:09,241 --> 01:56:12,030
Especially in this day and age when
people turn on people for like,

2832
01:56:12,031 --> 01:56:16,230
you know the garrison keillor story,
he's the saddest story in this.

2833
01:56:16,231 --> 01:56:19,320
Me Too.
Stuff because garrison keillor is a guy

2834
01:56:19,321 --> 01:56:22,830
who had the lake.
Woebegone chronicles is this pbs show

2835
01:56:23,100 --> 01:56:28,100
radio shows ongoing for decades and he's
a writer and he hugged a woman.

2836
01:56:29,340 --> 01:56:31,920
She was.
He was consoling her and hugged her,

2837
01:56:32,190 --> 01:56:37,190
and apparently while he was hugging her,
his arm went down her back on her back

2838
01:56:37,980 --> 01:56:38,970
and he apologized.

2839
01:56:38,970 --> 01:56:40,440
She pulled away.
He apologized.

2840
01:56:40,441 --> 01:56:41,880
He sent her a letter.
He apologized.

2841
01:56:42,390 --> 01:56:44,230
He said,
I'm sorry I didn't mean to do that.

2842
01:56:44,260 --> 01:56:45,150
She says,
don't worry.

2843
01:56:45,180 --> 01:56:46,230
No worries.
Don't worry about it.

2844
01:56:46,500 --> 01:56:49,410
Years later when all this meat to
frenzy,

2845
01:56:49,530 --> 01:56:51,540
she brings this up.
He gets fired.

2846
01:56:51,541 --> 01:56:54,540
They pull his name off the shelf for
touching a girl's back.

2847
01:56:54,750 --> 01:56:59,040
It's like the frenzy was so hot.
They didn't want to be accused of not

2848
01:56:59,041 --> 01:57:02,490
doing anything,
so they pulled this guy I know and you

2849
01:57:02,491 --> 01:57:04,230
know there is the worst side of it,
right?

2850
01:57:04,231 --> 01:57:06,240
There's the Harvey Weinsteins of the
world.

2851
01:57:06,241 --> 01:57:09,570
There's the people that are absolutely
monsters,

2852
01:57:09,571 --> 01:57:10,800
right?
There's those people,

2853
01:57:11,040 --> 01:57:15,300
but then there's people that just got
caught up in the wave of outrage and

2854
01:57:15,301 --> 01:57:16,740
it's just.
It's a strange,

2855
01:57:17,100 --> 01:57:18,530
a strange time,
like the.

2856
01:57:18,870 --> 01:57:20,100
There's no balance to it.
Well,

2857
01:57:20,101 --> 01:57:25,101
the pendulum is gonna swing until you
know our attitudes balance out.

2858
01:57:26,300 --> 01:57:29,610
I mean this,
the fact that the me too movement is not

2859
01:57:29,611 --> 01:57:33,240
a bad thing because it's bringing up
some serious issues that we've had.

2860
01:57:33,950 --> 01:57:37,050
It's a great thing to happen,
so in the meantime there's going to be

2861
01:57:37,051 --> 01:57:41,340
collateral damage for that until we now
get back to a time where we can like men

2862
01:57:41,341 --> 01:57:46,341
whack like gentlemen and we'll be able
to have interpersonal relationships with

2863
01:57:46,951 --> 01:57:49,830
women at work and in a setting and make
it professional,

2864
01:57:50,250 --> 01:57:52,560
but at the same time we also don't want
a sterile environment.

2865
01:57:52,590 --> 01:57:53,160
You know,
when you,

2866
01:57:53,160 --> 01:57:56,460
when you go to these seminars,
because like even for our show now,

2867
01:57:56,461 --> 01:57:58,470
because of all this,
you have to have like a sexual

2868
01:57:58,471 --> 01:57:59,910
harassment meeting before you start.
Well,

2869
01:57:59,911 --> 01:58:01,440
they had those in the 90.
Exactly.

2870
01:58:01,530 --> 01:58:04,800
I went to those for hardball show that
it was on in 94,

2871
01:58:04,801 --> 01:58:08,190
but one of the things they always say
because you can't define this right,

2872
01:58:08,340 --> 01:58:10,200
you know it when you see it.

2873
01:58:10,530 --> 01:58:11,670
Well,
that's what they used to say about

2874
01:58:11,671 --> 01:58:13,950
pornography,
but that's what we've lost.

2875
01:58:13,951 --> 01:58:17,340
That ability to understand that like I
think that that applies to me,

2876
01:58:17,341 --> 01:58:19,590
that's not a good definition.
It's probably but it,

2877
01:58:19,860 --> 01:58:22,560
but that is the definition.
It's the same thing that goes with

2878
01:58:22,640 --> 01:58:24,510
oversensitivity.
I think that too.

2879
01:58:25,020 --> 01:58:26,930
We should know it when we see it and
we're.

2880
01:58:26,931 --> 01:58:28,470
We're not.
We're not recognizing that.

2881
01:58:28,471 --> 01:58:28,831
It's like,
you know,

2882
01:58:28,831 --> 01:58:31,250
you're acting and this is a bit much
right now sometimes.

2883
01:58:31,251 --> 01:58:35,250
Did you hear about the two college kids
that got drunk and had sex and the boy

2884
01:58:35,730 --> 01:58:40,730
upon waking up and sobering up,
decided to preemptively accused the girl

2885
01:58:41,381 --> 01:58:43,780
of sexual assault because he was
intoxicated.

2886
01:58:44,080 --> 01:58:48,580
So he filed and went after her.
She got suspended from school.

2887
01:58:48,640 --> 01:58:53,050
They had to do it because otherwise they
would be sexist because they do it all

2888
01:58:53,051 --> 01:58:53,710
the time.

2889
01:58:53,710 --> 01:58:56,500
If it's a boy and a girl,
it's always thought that if a boy,

2890
01:58:56,800 --> 01:58:58,570
do you know the Occidental College
story?

2891
01:58:59,400 --> 01:59:03,340
So pretty famous story from a few years
back with these two kids that were in

2892
01:59:03,341 --> 01:59:05,650
college.
The guy called texts,

2893
01:59:05,651 --> 01:59:07,630
the girl,
you know I'm cone over.

2894
01:59:07,631 --> 01:59:08,950
She's like,
you have condoms?

2895
01:59:08,951 --> 01:59:09,880
He says,
yes,

2896
01:59:09,881 --> 01:59:12,790
you know,
so clearly intent has been established,

2897
01:59:12,791 --> 01:59:14,320
right?
Goes overhead sex with her.

2898
01:59:14,330 --> 01:59:16,630
Her friends convinced her because she
was intoxicated,

2899
01:59:16,631 --> 01:59:21,631
that it was sex under the influence,
so it was rape and so she goes to the

2900
01:59:22,240 --> 01:59:25,480
university officials and they suspend
the boy.

2901
01:59:25,481 --> 01:59:29,650
He sues and wins and the whole things.
The whole thing's chaos because this kid

2902
01:59:29,890 --> 01:59:32,620
gets kicked out of fucking school.
Actually did he,

2903
01:59:32,621 --> 01:59:37,621
when I need to know that if you want to
check fact check that Occidental,

2904
01:59:37,990 --> 01:59:40,660
but now you've got to happen now to even
interact with them when you have to have

2905
01:59:40,661 --> 01:59:41,410
a notary.

2906
01:59:41,410 --> 01:59:42,250
Well,
that's what they're saying.

2907
01:59:42,490 --> 01:59:44,680
People video.
I consent to,

2908
01:59:44,710 --> 01:59:46,660
you know,
so here's where it gets even screw here.

2909
01:59:46,930 --> 01:59:49,390
There was a real article the other day
that was saying,

2910
01:59:49,420 --> 01:59:53,770
is it physically possible for two people
to simultaneously sexual assault each

2911
01:59:53,771 --> 01:59:58,570
other and they're debating this in the
college because they trying to figure

2912
01:59:58,571 --> 02:00:03,100
out if two people are both drunk and
like they get together and they're both

2913
02:00:03,101 --> 02:00:05,890
sloppy and fucking hammered and they
decided to have sex.

2914
02:00:05,920 --> 02:00:07,720
Did they both sexually assault each
other?

2915
02:00:08,080 --> 02:00:11,710
Isn't this really about choices that we
make?

2916
02:00:12,010 --> 02:00:13,630
Well,
it's also about taking responsibility

2917
02:00:13,631 --> 02:00:14,920
for your actions.
If you're an adult.

2918
02:00:15,010 --> 02:00:18,760
If you decide to get in your car and
you're drunk and you plow into a bus and

2919
02:00:18,761 --> 02:00:20,620
kill a bunch of people,
no one says,

2920
02:00:20,650 --> 02:00:22,030
oh,
Eric was just drunk.

2921
02:00:22,060 --> 02:00:25,480
He is not responsible for his actions.
You're responsible for your actions.

2922
02:00:25,480 --> 02:00:27,010
If you're drunk,
if you're driving a car and he killed

2923
02:00:27,011 --> 02:00:29,590
somebody.
But the idea is that if a girl comes

2924
02:00:29,591 --> 02:00:34,540
over your house and you're drunk and you
know you're not responsible for your

2925
02:00:34,541 --> 02:00:36,370
actions,
and especially if you're a girl and

2926
02:00:36,371 --> 02:00:38,740
you're drunk,
you're not responsible for your actions.

2927
02:00:38,741 --> 02:00:41,950
Then if you're having sex with a guy,
but you're definitely responsible for

2928
02:00:41,951 --> 02:00:43,690
your actions.
If you're a girl and you get in a car

2929
02:00:43,840 --> 02:00:46,930
and drive and hit someone,
but at the same time though,

2930
02:00:47,170 --> 02:00:48,690
like a girl,
a girl,

2931
02:00:48,730 --> 02:00:53,730
anyone should be allowed to be with her
friends or with his friends and you get

2932
02:00:55,721 --> 02:00:57,400
sloppy drunk.
Uh,

2933
02:00:57,610 --> 02:00:59,320
you protect it.
You should be carrying.

2934
02:00:59,560 --> 02:01:01,930
You shouldn't be.
It's not okay that somebody decided to

2935
02:01:01,931 --> 02:01:03,040
like,
go further with it.

2936
02:01:03,510 --> 02:01:04,343
You know?
Well,

2937
02:01:04,570 --> 02:01:07,960
the most egregious cases obviously cosby
because that was his thing.

2938
02:01:07,990 --> 02:01:09,910
I mean,
if he did do what everybody's accusing

2939
02:01:09,911 --> 02:01:12,040
him of doing and we have no reason to
think he didn't,

2940
02:01:13,030 --> 02:01:17,680
he was taking people that thought of him
as a mentor and thought that he was

2941
02:01:17,681 --> 02:01:20,500
going to help their career and that's,
that was his hustle and he would just

2942
02:01:20,501 --> 02:01:23,920
drug them and they'd wake up with their
pussy sore and their fucking pants off

2943
02:01:23,921 --> 02:01:26,590
and not knowing what happened and be
super confused.

2944
02:01:26,770 --> 02:01:28,130
It's horrible.
I mean,

2945
02:01:28,150 --> 02:01:29,560
that's,
that's the worst,

2946
02:01:29,880 --> 02:01:32,110
the worst version of it.
But then it's like,

2947
02:01:32,111 --> 02:01:34,420
you know,
this is one of those things where I'm

2948
02:01:34,421 --> 02:01:36,640
saying it's like this.
That is hard to define.

2949
02:01:36,880 --> 02:01:40,130
There's no real definition.
You can't put it down in writing to say

2950
02:01:40,130 --> 02:01:41,510
like,
this is what this is.

2951
02:01:41,511 --> 02:01:45,350
Because then you got a situation where
you're out on a date with someone.

2952
02:01:45,410 --> 02:01:47,480
Things are going well.
You think it's going well,

2953
02:01:47,510 --> 02:01:51,410
you get into bed and then that person in
what for whatever reason decides,

2954
02:01:51,830 --> 02:01:53,810
uh,
I think we should stop.

2955
02:01:53,870 --> 02:01:56,780
I don't want to do this anymore.
And that,

2956
02:01:56,810 --> 02:01:57,980
that,
that could be,

2957
02:01:58,730 --> 02:02:02,210
that could be on the same level as drug.
And somebody,

2958
02:02:02,680 --> 02:02:04,130
sorry,
clubbing them on the head.

2959
02:02:04,280 --> 02:02:09,280
That girl writes that crazy fucking
story to 5,000 word story that is easy

2960
02:02:09,351 --> 02:02:12,170
as everything is just about him not
being a gentlemen.

2961
02:02:12,470 --> 02:02:13,191
Right.
That's all.

2962
02:02:13,191 --> 02:02:14,630
That was.
Not just dad,

2963
02:02:14,631 --> 02:02:17,750
but she was just grossed out by it and
decided to go after him.

2964
02:02:17,870 --> 02:02:19,880
But you know,
I know I can understand being in a

2965
02:02:19,881 --> 02:02:21,080
situation like,
you know,

2966
02:02:21,081 --> 02:02:22,640
people got on the woman because they
were like,

2967
02:02:22,641 --> 02:02:23,091
you know what,
Hey,

2968
02:02:23,091 --> 02:02:24,620
you still blew him three times.

2969
02:02:24,620 --> 02:02:26,510
Right.
But I understand that being in a

2970
02:02:26,511 --> 02:02:29,510
situation where you're like,
you're.

2971
02:02:29,720 --> 02:02:30,980
Because it's happened to me.
All right.

2972
02:02:30,990 --> 02:02:32,750
I,
I was at a comedy club,

2973
02:02:32,930 --> 02:02:34,490
you know,
I told this girl,

2974
02:02:34,520 --> 02:02:35,540
this was years ago.
I told her,

2975
02:02:35,650 --> 02:02:36,470
I said,
she was like,

2976
02:02:36,470 --> 02:02:38,210
I'm coming back to your hotel.
Like,

2977
02:02:38,220 --> 02:02:39,110
you know,
no,

2978
02:02:39,230 --> 02:02:40,910
I don't think you should.
I didn't want to.

2979
02:02:40,911 --> 02:02:43,220
I wasn't like I wasn't.
She forced herself on you.

2980
02:02:43,250 --> 02:02:45,890
It wasn't going to explain.
Imagine if you were a girl.

2981
02:02:45,980 --> 02:02:47,420
That's,
that's where it gets really scary.

2982
02:02:47,630 --> 02:02:50,900
But first of all,
everything she's saying to me this whole

2983
02:02:50,901 --> 02:02:54,680
night up to getting to my hotel.
If I would have done that to a woman is

2984
02:02:55,500 --> 02:02:58,690
assault abuse,
like threatening from the jump.

2985
02:02:58,820 --> 02:03:01,550
So we already talked about this,
but this is what happened.

2986
02:03:01,580 --> 02:03:03,200
So I get,
I say to her,

2987
02:03:03,620 --> 02:03:05,040
I was like,
I don't think I said it was really

2988
02:03:05,060 --> 02:03:06,350
interesting at the time I wasn't.

2989
02:03:06,350 --> 02:03:07,970
I was like,
I don't know if this is a good idea.

2990
02:03:08,580 --> 02:03:09,750
I think you should go home,
you know,

2991
02:03:09,920 --> 02:03:11,210
and then she's like,
no,

2992
02:03:11,390 --> 02:03:14,390
I'll walk you to your hotel because we
were hanging out the whole day.

2993
02:03:14,480 --> 02:03:17,660
Everybody's hanging out this place.
After the Sunday night show,

2994
02:03:17,980 --> 02:03:18,813
I said,
okay,

2995
02:03:18,890 --> 02:03:20,120
we get to the hotel.
I go,

2996
02:03:20,121 --> 02:03:21,050
well,
thanks for walking me,

2997
02:03:21,051 --> 02:03:23,000
but I think you should probably know,
you know,

2998
02:03:23,001 --> 02:03:25,640
I cleaned your dick with him now that's,
you know,

2999
02:03:25,730 --> 02:03:27,920
it's like a,
I will give you a massage.

3000
02:03:27,950 --> 02:03:29,990
It was all just kind of stuff.
I think you should go.

3001
02:03:29,991 --> 02:03:32,330
I'm not really.
Then my ego kicks in because I'm like,

3002
02:03:32,331 --> 02:03:32,841
well,
you know,

3003
02:03:32,841 --> 02:03:34,040
alright you,
you like me like this.

3004
02:03:34,041 --> 02:03:35,240
Okay.
So we get up,

3005
02:03:35,330 --> 02:03:38,480
we finally get upstairs.
I still am like,

3006
02:03:38,510 --> 02:03:40,160
maybe we,
maybe we shouldn't do this,

3007
02:03:40,161 --> 02:03:43,160
you know?
And then she starts to like,

3008
02:03:44,060 --> 02:03:44,720
Oh,
you're,

3009
02:03:44,720 --> 02:03:47,570
oh,
you're just because you're not into me.

3010
02:03:47,570 --> 02:03:49,730
It's because I'm,
I'm hideous or whatever.

3011
02:03:49,910 --> 02:03:51,430
So now I felt like,
oh,

3012
02:03:51,440 --> 02:03:54,500
I have to fuck her.
Fuck.

3013
02:03:55,160 --> 02:03:58,820
I felt like I got to do this.
It's like I had to do this because I

3014
02:03:58,821 --> 02:03:59,920
don't want to become a cause.
Like I'm,

3015
02:04:00,020 --> 02:04:02,300
you know,
what I'm saying about the reason how I

3016
02:04:02,301 --> 02:04:06,980
apply this to the zs situation is the
fact that this girl is in a situation

3017
02:04:06,981 --> 02:04:09,170
where she feels like,
I guess I have to do this.

3018
02:04:09,400 --> 02:04:11,620
Like I may not want to do it.
No,

3019
02:04:11,660 --> 02:04:15,860
we're speculating.
We're in a situation where I didn't

3020
02:04:15,861 --> 02:04:20,510
necessarily want to do it,
but I felt like the social pressure of

3021
02:04:20,511 --> 02:04:22,280
like,
well maybe I have to follow through with

3022
02:04:22,281 --> 02:04:23,430
what I'm doing right now.
No,

3023
02:04:23,450 --> 02:04:24,231
I get it.
Yeah,

3024
02:04:24,231 --> 02:04:27,320
that's definitely in the morning.
I had my hat to fly when we're not.

3025
02:04:27,321 --> 02:04:28,910
Even in the morning I say we're
finished.

3026
02:04:28,910 --> 02:04:29,450
And I'm like,
I said,

3027
02:04:29,450 --> 02:04:29,751
hey,
you know,

3028
02:04:29,751 --> 02:04:32,720
you've got to go.
Because I got a pack and she started to

3029
02:04:32,721 --> 02:04:35,870
cry
and I thought this,

3030
02:04:35,930 --> 02:04:38,070
if this was happening now,
this could be a situation.

3031
02:04:38,250 --> 02:04:41,670
It could easily be somebody.
She could tell her story differently,

3032
02:04:41,880 --> 02:04:44,070
so we don't know.
That's why there's no rules.

3033
02:04:44,250 --> 02:04:47,340
What this lady did was she was
aggressive and flirting and she wanted

3034
02:04:47,341 --> 02:04:49,980
what she wanted and she got it,
you know,

3035
02:04:50,040 --> 02:04:52,710
so that's sometimes is okay,
depending on the person that you're

3036
02:04:52,711 --> 02:04:55,500
dealing with.
But that same situation with someone

3037
02:04:55,501 --> 02:04:57,240
else could be.
No,

3038
02:04:57,241 --> 02:04:58,460
this was horrible.
I,

3039
02:04:58,461 --> 02:04:59,140
I,
I,

3040
02:04:59,140 --> 02:05:01,410
I felt,
I felt intimidated.

3041
02:05:01,411 --> 02:05:02,244
I felt,
you know,

3042
02:05:02,280 --> 02:05:04,650
it's all in how you interpreted it will
interpret it.

3043
02:05:04,710 --> 02:05:05,850
Yeah.
It's definitely,

3044
02:05:06,740 --> 02:05:10,530
it depends on who's talking and whether
or not you're attract each other.

3045
02:05:10,550 --> 02:05:14,310
Here's a perfect example.
If you and your girlfriend decided to

3046
02:05:14,311 --> 02:05:18,000
get drunk and your girlfriend was drunk
and she called you up and said,

3047
02:05:18,330 --> 02:05:19,830
come on over,
you know,

3048
02:05:19,831 --> 02:05:20,341
uh,
you know,

3049
02:05:20,341 --> 02:05:20,850
I'm horny.

3050
02:05:20,850 --> 02:05:23,100
I want you to fuck me.
If you went over and did it,

3051
02:05:23,580 --> 02:05:26,400
you would,
in some people's eyes be guilty of

3052
02:05:26,401 --> 02:05:29,340
sexual assault because she was drunk and
she couldn't consent.

3053
02:05:29,730 --> 02:05:31,620
And this is why I'd never done that,
by the way,

3054
02:05:31,920 --> 02:05:33,660
my,
one of my ex girlfriends was like that.

3055
02:05:33,990 --> 02:05:35,300
She wanted to get drunk.
Really?

3056
02:05:35,400 --> 02:05:37,170
She was,
I just want to affect when I'm drunk and

3057
02:05:37,171 --> 02:05:39,960
I just couldn't do it.
I didn't feel were nervous about it.

3058
02:05:40,140 --> 02:05:42,810
It wasn't.
But it was just me personally,

3059
02:05:43,000 --> 02:05:44,820
I don't drink,
you don't drink.

3060
02:05:44,821 --> 02:05:47,700
I don't drink at all.
So I always felt like if I'm not

3061
02:05:47,730 --> 02:05:50,010
drinking,
it just feels like,

3062
02:05:50,011 --> 02:05:53,400
what if she says she wants to do
something that like she doesn't normally

3063
02:05:53,401 --> 02:05:55,890
want to do and then she's going to get
sober and be like,

3064
02:05:55,950 --> 02:05:57,870
why did you do that to my butthole or
whatever.

3065
02:05:59,610 --> 02:06:00,360
You know what I mean?
Like why?

3066
02:06:00,360 --> 02:06:02,090
And they like what?
But you said she gets.

3067
02:06:02,310 --> 02:06:04,140
Because it'll always come back to,
well you know,

3068
02:06:04,141 --> 02:06:06,600
I was drunk but I didn't really meet.
I didn't,

3069
02:06:06,610 --> 02:06:07,231
you know.
Then I'm like,

3070
02:06:07,231 --> 02:06:08,820
okay,
I don't want to be the choice maker.

3071
02:06:08,821 --> 02:06:11,250
And that was the best thing about not
drinking.

3072
02:06:11,340 --> 02:06:12,690
Right.
In that situation,

3073
02:06:12,720 --> 02:06:15,600
if you don't drink,
you never have to think like that.

3074
02:06:15,770 --> 02:06:17,850
But that's why sometimes I don't want to
hang out.

3075
02:06:17,870 --> 02:06:19,320
That's thought.
Sometimes I don't want to hang out with

3076
02:06:19,321 --> 02:06:22,770
people that are like,
they get dumb drunk,

3077
02:06:22,771 --> 02:06:25,170
you're out.
And then I become responsible.

3078
02:06:25,260 --> 02:06:26,910
Oh well what's the worst when you're
sober?

3079
02:06:27,210 --> 02:06:27,721
Like,
Whoa,

3080
02:06:27,721 --> 02:06:29,580
I don't want to deal with their
behaviors.

3081
02:06:29,590 --> 02:06:32,260
So fucking gross gross,
you know?

3082
02:06:32,280 --> 02:06:34,440
Then you see your friend,
especially if you have like a female

3083
02:06:34,441 --> 02:06:35,230
friend,
you're not,

3084
02:06:35,230 --> 02:06:36,900
you're not like that with them.

3085
02:06:37,200 --> 02:06:39,270
But then you're out and then she's,
you know,

3086
02:06:39,420 --> 02:06:42,060
her skirt is coming up and you see the
creepy guy.

3087
02:06:42,180 --> 02:06:44,970
You see the guy that she's just like,
Oh man,

3088
02:06:45,210 --> 02:06:47,970
what do I do right now?
But can I go if I don't stop her from

3089
02:06:47,971 --> 02:06:49,350
going?
And then something happens that she

3090
02:06:49,351 --> 02:06:51,810
doesn't want to happen is if a stopper.
And she's like,

3091
02:06:51,811 --> 02:06:53,300
yeah,
I fucking hate her

3092
02:06:55,750 --> 02:07:00,750
and we are going to have an amazing time
and you fucking hater this,

3093
02:07:01,681 --> 02:07:03,690
all this Harvey Weinstein and all this
kind of shit.

3094
02:07:03,740 --> 02:07:04,780
It's set.
You know,

3095
02:07:04,820 --> 02:07:09,820
it said ugly dudes back like 20 years.
All my advances that I've made with hot

3096
02:07:10,381 --> 02:07:14,270
chicks has just been like,
I'm so glad to have power.

3097
02:07:14,280 --> 02:07:15,840
Here's the thing,
it's not about ugly.

3098
02:07:16,020 --> 02:07:19,170
It's about Harvey Weinstein being in
control of a studio.

3099
02:07:19,200 --> 02:07:22,340
Zack and scaring all those girls into
fucking man,

3100
02:07:22,410 --> 02:07:24,270
allegedly raping some of them,
you know,

3101
02:07:24,271 --> 02:07:26,040
I mean,
I don't know what he did or didn't do,

3102
02:07:26,041 --> 02:07:27,600
but he definitely did a lot of shit.

3103
02:07:27,690 --> 02:07:29,850
I wish I just wished it.
A lot of these people will.

3104
02:07:29,900 --> 02:07:32,880
I wished it's too.
Maybe now people will have the courage

3105
02:07:32,881 --> 02:07:36,790
to come out because it's certain sex to
hear about like,

3106
02:07:36,791 --> 02:07:39,010
you know,
this happened to Angelina Jolie and then

3107
02:07:39,011 --> 02:07:39,671
like,
oh,

3108
02:07:39,671 --> 02:07:41,620
so then she.
There was a certain time when she was

3109
02:07:41,621 --> 02:07:45,270
like the most famous woman in Hollywood
and she didn't say,

3110
02:07:45,400 --> 02:07:46,670
still didn't say anything.
Yeah.

3111
02:07:46,700 --> 02:07:49,690
So we lived in a black ball.
I know it sucks that we live in a

3112
02:07:49,691 --> 02:07:53,410
culture like so maybe that's why some
innocent people are getting,

3113
02:07:53,620 --> 02:07:58,330
getting caught in the crossfire.
So we can obliterate this sort of

3114
02:07:58,450 --> 02:08:01,060
behavior and attitude from our culture.
But in the meantime,

3115
02:08:01,061 --> 02:08:03,570
while we're going through this,
there's going to be some dealers and

3116
02:08:03,571 --> 02:08:06,340
it's going to be some people that are
going to get caught in the crossfire.

3117
02:08:06,370 --> 02:08:07,360
Did you ever drink?

3118
02:08:07,480 --> 02:08:08,500
No.
Never.

3119
02:08:08,550 --> 02:08:08,861
No.
No,

3120
02:08:08,861 --> 02:08:09,400
no.
I never.

3121
02:08:09,400 --> 02:08:11,230
I never wanted to.
Um,

3122
02:08:11,260 --> 02:08:12,750
when I was in high school,
we're going to have,

3123
02:08:12,860 --> 02:08:14,510
you know,
friends would drink and stuff and I just

3124
02:08:14,800 --> 02:08:15,970
wasn't.
I didn't like the taste.

3125
02:08:16,780 --> 02:08:19,180
I would tell you I haven't had half a
beer at a party one time when I was

3126
02:08:19,181 --> 02:08:20,050
like,
what?

3127
02:08:20,710 --> 02:08:21,850
This is disgusting,
you know?

3128
02:08:21,851 --> 02:08:23,860
And then it was,
you know,

3129
02:08:23,861 --> 02:08:27,070
what really decided to,
for me it was like the 1999,

3130
02:08:27,130 --> 02:08:29,500
2000 new year's,
like going into,

3131
02:08:29,620 --> 02:08:31,990
you know,
y two k going into that,

3132
02:08:31,991 --> 02:08:35,980
I was at a party that I was like,
I never want to be like this.

3133
02:08:36,250 --> 02:08:38,500
People were hammered.
Just that was a weird one.

3134
02:08:38,501 --> 02:08:40,630
Right?
Everybody was super drunk on y twoK ,

3135
02:08:40,870 --> 02:08:45,070
they thought it was
going to shut off wherever I was taking

3136
02:08:45,071 --> 02:08:47,190
care of somebody's baby,
you know?

3137
02:08:47,200 --> 02:08:49,170
Yeah.
Because that's what they're at.

3138
02:08:49,230 --> 02:08:50,530
This party.
I had a baby.

3139
02:08:50,560 --> 02:08:52,100
Who the fuck if you a baby?
No,

3140
02:08:52,140 --> 02:08:57,140
I was taking because they were drunk.
I was drunk and left you with their

3141
02:08:57,330 --> 02:08:59,050
baby.
I had the baby.

3142
02:08:59,080 --> 02:09:00,620
Mr. Yeah,
it was crazy part.

3143
02:09:00,780 --> 02:09:02,200
Fuck.
Are these people with a baby?

3144
02:09:02,240 --> 02:09:05,590
And I in that and the husband,
he poor kid is 18 years old,

3145
02:09:05,690 --> 02:09:07,850
man.
Fuck that.

3146
02:09:08,120 --> 02:09:10,030
Griff was babysitting.
Babysitting.

3147
02:09:10,680 --> 02:09:13,170
Taking care of people.
So then you hear these rumors,

3148
02:09:13,200 --> 02:09:17,290
you hear these stories about people die
because they're choking on their own

3149
02:09:17,291 --> 02:09:19,570
vomit.
So like there's people that are like

3150
02:09:19,600 --> 02:09:22,880
passed out like this.
So I got to turn people to their site

3151
02:09:23,350 --> 02:09:27,580
and I said I never want to be like this.
You were turning people into holding a

3152
02:09:27,581 --> 02:09:31,810
baby and holding a baby.
And Mr Wirtz Shithole party man.

3153
02:09:31,811 --> 02:09:33,430
And I got invited.
I got invited.

3154
02:09:33,431 --> 02:09:34,870
I went to some of my friends.

3155
02:09:34,870 --> 02:09:36,820
I was a,
I was the wolf and this shit dude.

3156
02:09:37,240 --> 02:09:39,910
I was the wolf.
So if you're having a party and you

3157
02:09:39,911 --> 02:09:42,520
think it's gonna get crazy.
You Call Eric Griffin and I'm going to

3158
02:09:42,521 --> 02:09:43,990
come.
Got The wolf.

3159
02:09:44,290 --> 02:09:47,170
Craziest party I've ever heard of.
So after that I knew I didn't want to,

3160
02:09:47,180 --> 02:09:49,990
so I recently I went with a buddy of
mine to,

3161
02:09:50,020 --> 02:09:51,310
on vacation,
you know,

3162
02:09:51,720 --> 02:09:53,320
and when we went,
uh,

3163
02:09:53,321 --> 02:09:54,280
that deal was,
he was like,

3164
02:09:54,281 --> 02:09:55,570
come on man,
you gotta have some drinks.

3165
02:09:55,571 --> 02:09:57,150
So I,
I had a head,

3166
02:09:57,170 --> 02:09:58,630
like a banana Daiquiri on,
on,

3167
02:09:58,631 --> 02:09:59,020
uh,
on a,

3168
02:09:59,020 --> 02:09:59,853
you know,
and I was like,

3169
02:09:59,920 --> 02:10:01,900
this is okay.
And then I had,

3170
02:10:02,140 --> 02:10:02,801
you know,
when you go to,

3171
02:10:02,801 --> 02:10:04,450
like,
you're going to a resort vacation,

3172
02:10:04,480 --> 02:10:06,550
that will always be like a special at
the bar,

3173
02:10:06,880 --> 02:10:07,451
you know,
like,

3174
02:10:07,451 --> 02:10:08,530
Hey,
help today's drink.

3175
02:10:08,740 --> 02:10:12,790
I said I'll try it.
I had like 15 percent of that thing and

3176
02:10:12,791 --> 02:10:14,590
I was loopy.
Yeah.

3177
02:10:14,591 --> 02:10:15,440
I was ready to,
you know,

3178
02:10:15,580 --> 02:10:20,580
tweet racist shit.
So I was like,

3179
02:10:22,750 --> 02:10:23,710
I was like,
Nah,

3180
02:10:23,830 --> 02:10:24,521
Nah,
what about,

3181
02:10:24,521 --> 02:10:27,550
we'd know we'd either never,
never,

3182
02:10:27,610 --> 02:10:29,320
never.
My current girlfriend,

3183
02:10:29,321 --> 02:10:32,170
she loves we.
So I tried one time,

3184
02:10:32,370 --> 02:10:33,770
did you get nervous?
I was like,

3185
02:10:34,190 --> 02:10:35,150
I don't like this.
I said,

3186
02:10:35,180 --> 02:10:36,650
how do you,
I can't be like,

3187
02:10:37,330 --> 02:10:40,400
you know,
so that's why if I didn't have joe,

3188
02:10:40,430 --> 02:10:42,950
if I did ever have comedy,
what would you do?

3189
02:10:43,010 --> 02:10:44,420
I'd be a crazy person.
Well,

3190
02:10:44,421 --> 02:10:47,480
you're a crazy person now.
He just calming it down with comedy.

3191
02:10:47,500 --> 02:10:48,261
I,
you're a good,

3192
02:10:48,261 --> 02:10:50,370
crazy person.
You're a very nice guy.

3193
02:10:50,420 --> 02:10:51,800
Legit need comment.
I,

3194
02:10:51,801 --> 02:10:53,720
I,
this sounds like one of those cliche

3195
02:10:53,721 --> 02:10:55,100
type of things,
but I,

3196
02:10:55,160 --> 02:10:57,200
I rely on it.
I go to therapy,

3197
02:10:57,230 --> 02:10:58,730
you know,
I go to there and just been great for

3198
02:10:58,731 --> 02:10:59,451
me.
You know,

3199
02:10:59,451 --> 02:11:00,890
it's really been great.
I love going to therapy.

3200
02:11:00,891 --> 02:11:04,790
I love because I feel like I can talk to
somebody and then intellectualize things

3201
02:11:04,791 --> 02:11:08,060
on a level that like you can't
necessarily do with regular people and

3202
02:11:08,480 --> 02:11:10,880
understands human nature.
Yes,

3203
02:11:10,881 --> 02:11:11,870
yes,
yes.

3204
02:11:11,920 --> 02:11:13,990
And they can go over,
Oh yes,

3205
02:11:14,000 --> 02:11:17,360
why you did this or what,
what was the insecurity that triggered

3206
02:11:17,440 --> 02:11:18,550
that apply?

3207
02:11:18,650 --> 02:11:21,220
And I've learned things about myself.
I'm learning things about like,

3208
02:11:21,600 --> 02:11:23,580
like I was the only child,
you know,

3209
02:11:23,600 --> 02:11:25,910
single mom.
So there's all these things I've

3210
02:11:25,911 --> 02:11:30,911
learning about like why I interact with
my girlfriend the way I do because of my

3211
02:11:31,131 --> 02:11:35,300
mom and like my friendships and why get
angry about certain things.

3212
02:11:35,450 --> 02:11:37,880
It applies to things on stage.
Yeah.

3213
02:11:38,520 --> 02:11:42,350
So I'm really why I have so many of
these types of relationships in my life

3214
02:11:42,351 --> 02:11:43,500
where people are like,
you know,

3215
02:11:43,520 --> 02:11:45,120
needy,
you know,

3216
02:11:45,121 --> 02:11:47,690
like I find myself being like the one
that's trying to help.

3217
02:11:47,691 --> 02:11:49,170
I don't have a lot of equal
relationship.

3218
02:11:49,171 --> 02:11:52,910
So I learned all these things,
probably felt vulnerable as a kid and

3219
02:11:52,911 --> 02:11:55,660
when you see vulnerable people you want
to help them can relate.

3220
02:11:56,000 --> 02:11:58,490
And my mom too,
my mom went through a lot to get to the

3221
02:11:58,491 --> 02:11:59,120
states,
you know,

3222
02:11:59,120 --> 02:12:03,830
she was from Belize in Central America
and like just coming here and hearing

3223
02:12:03,831 --> 02:12:05,180
her stories and like,
you know,

3224
02:12:05,210 --> 02:12:06,850
having,
having to like be somebody to take.

3225
02:12:06,850 --> 02:12:08,900
I had,
I was 15 years old how we to take care

3226
02:12:08,901 --> 02:12:09,561
of my mom,
like,

3227
02:12:09,561 --> 02:12:10,450
you know,
you know,

3228
02:12:10,520 --> 02:12:12,980
her emotions were.
And so then I,

3229
02:12:13,120 --> 02:12:14,790
that had an effect on me,
you know,

3230
02:12:14,990 --> 02:12:17,600
but I didn't learn this until I was able
to go talk to a professional.

3231
02:12:17,690 --> 02:12:19,820
Are you close with your dad?
I had never met my dad,

3232
02:12:19,880 --> 02:12:21,050
you know,
single parent.

3233
02:12:21,080 --> 02:12:23,930
You never met my dad.
So thanks for bringing that up.

3234
02:12:24,660 --> 02:12:29,180
I don't know.
Money that mine's name is Joe Rogan

3235
02:12:29,180 --> 02:12:30,040
Shit.
He's out there someplace.

3236
02:12:30,041 --> 02:12:31,160
He's out there.
Yeah.

3237
02:12:31,161 --> 02:12:34,190
I've never met my dad and then I thought
people.

3238
02:12:34,250 --> 02:12:36,470
Did you ever want to meet your dad?
Did you ever see?

3239
02:12:36,471 --> 02:12:38,330
You know what's funny?
My mom want me to met him.

3240
02:12:38,331 --> 02:12:39,910
I knew him until I was like,
oh,

3241
02:12:39,920 --> 02:12:41,330
that's worse.
I never knew.

3242
02:12:41,730 --> 02:12:44,180
So I think that that's when you.
If you know them a little bit and then

3243
02:12:44,181 --> 02:12:45,470
they're gone,
that sucks.

3244
02:12:46,040 --> 02:12:49,730
The good thing is that it made me
realize that you can't count on people,

3245
02:12:49,850 --> 02:12:54,850
but you can catch issues.
Definitely a trusted player become

3246
02:12:55,251 --> 02:12:58,430
someone that people count on,
count on people.

3247
02:12:58,460 --> 02:13:01,550
That's what you do.
Have a tight group of friends like me

3248
02:13:01,551 --> 02:13:03,730
and my friends are very close.
I get it.

3249
02:13:03,740 --> 02:13:06,980
I would do anything for my friends and
family to see.

3250
02:13:06,981 --> 02:13:08,960
I have a certain.
There's a certain level of loyalty that

3251
02:13:08,961 --> 02:13:10,760
I have because of that too.
Yeah,

3252
02:13:10,940 --> 02:13:13,880
well you understand it.
Whereas someone who grows up in a big

3253
02:13:13,881 --> 02:13:17,240
household filled with people and the
family was always there and everyone was

3254
02:13:17,241 --> 02:13:18,800
there.
You might take people for granted a

3255
02:13:18,801 --> 02:13:20,180
little bit,
you know,

3256
02:13:20,181 --> 02:13:24,260
whereas for me camaraderie and closeness
and all that,

3257
02:13:24,320 --> 02:13:25,970
that shit means a lot to it.
It's very,

3258
02:13:25,971 --> 02:13:28,520
very important.
I remember asking my mom about my dad

3259
02:13:28,521 --> 02:13:29,870
when I was like,
I don't know,

3260
02:13:29,930 --> 02:13:31,370
17,
18,

3261
02:13:31,890 --> 02:13:33,480
you know,
and she got really offended.

3262
02:13:33,690 --> 02:13:35,660
She was like,
I raised you and you know,

3263
02:13:35,930 --> 02:13:38,880
and that made me think like I was like,
but women have their secrets,

3264
02:13:38,970 --> 02:13:40,830
like they have their things and I didn't
want her to.

3265
02:13:40,920 --> 02:13:42,530
I never,
I don't regret your cry.

3266
02:13:42,750 --> 02:13:45,240
I don't want to pry.
And I didn't want to find out like maybe

3267
02:13:45,241 --> 02:13:47,070
he wanted to be in my life,
but my mom was like,

3268
02:13:47,071 --> 02:13:48,030
no,
who knows,

3269
02:13:48,031 --> 02:13:49,230
you know,
she think of my mom.

3270
02:13:49,320 --> 02:13:51,240
She could've been vindictive like that,
but I don't know,

3271
02:13:51,540 --> 02:13:54,990
but I didn't hold it against her.
But she told me his name and she was

3272
02:13:54,991 --> 02:13:55,711
like,
if you want to,

3273
02:13:55,711 --> 02:13:56,670
you just on your own,
you know,

3274
02:13:56,671 --> 02:14:01,170
that kind of thing.
And I had the name for like a week and

3275
02:14:01,171 --> 02:14:04,350
then I forgot it and that told me that
it didn't matter.

3276
02:14:05,040 --> 02:14:07,260
So I had ever since I never worried
about it.

3277
02:14:07,550 --> 02:14:08,800
Good for you.
Yeah.

3278
02:14:08,801 --> 02:14:10,980
It's,
there's some people that really bothers

3279
02:14:10,981 --> 02:14:13,560
them for their whole life.
And like one thing that happened though,

3280
02:14:13,561 --> 02:14:16,590
when you have kids,
your bond with your kids,

3281
02:14:16,591 --> 02:14:18,090
it's like it's.
I mean,

3282
02:14:18,091 --> 02:14:19,920
I,
I would assume that everyone's bond with

3283
02:14:19,921 --> 02:14:24,921
their children is very tight because
it's an unbelievable love connection

3284
02:14:26,701 --> 02:14:28,140
that you have with children.
It's true.

3285
02:14:28,141 --> 02:14:30,360
Unconditional love is not just true
unconditional.

3286
02:14:30,361 --> 02:14:32,730
It's like they,
they're a drug like they give you,

3287
02:14:32,790 --> 02:14:35,490
they give you love to the point where
like my daughter,

3288
02:14:35,610 --> 02:14:36,870
my,
my youngest was,

3289
02:14:36,990 --> 02:14:40,380
we were playing the other day in the
pool and there's a point in time we were

3290
02:14:40,381 --> 02:14:43,110
just laughing about something together,
just laughing and I'm looking at her

3291
02:14:43,111 --> 02:14:45,420
face and she's laughing and I felt like
I was on drugs.

3292
02:14:46,000 --> 02:14:48,660
I was like,
the love that I have for these people is

3293
02:14:48,661 --> 02:14:49,800
so,
it's so intense.

3294
02:14:49,800 --> 02:14:50,241
It's,
it's,

3295
02:14:50,241 --> 02:14:52,770
it's.
And it's also.

3296
02:14:52,950 --> 02:14:56,220
I didn't get that when I was kid.
I didn't know exactly what you're

3297
02:14:56,221 --> 02:14:56,971
saying,
man.

3298
02:14:56,971 --> 02:14:57,730
The parents,
my,

3299
02:14:57,730 --> 02:14:58,561
you know,
my mom worked,

3300
02:14:58,561 --> 02:15:01,260
my Stepdad was a really good guy.
But no one's ever around,

3301
02:15:01,400 --> 02:15:02,400
you know,
there's just,

3302
02:15:02,460 --> 02:15:05,220
there was no when they were done
working,

3303
02:15:05,250 --> 02:15:07,050
everybody was tired.
You know,

3304
02:15:07,080 --> 02:15:08,860
I was a latchkey kid.
You know what?

3305
02:15:09,220 --> 02:15:11,390
When I was seven years old,
I live in San Francisco,

3306
02:15:11,400 --> 02:15:14,100
would go out and do a magic show on
fisherman's wharf by myself.

3307
02:15:14,400 --> 02:15:16,950
Just wander around the city just so they
would open the door.

3308
02:15:16,951 --> 02:15:18,930
You just leave seven.
I can imagine that.

3309
02:15:18,931 --> 02:15:23,130
I spent a lot of time by myself too
because my mom was working by herself

3310
02:15:24,090 --> 02:15:26,460
trying to make it,
trying to make sure that I had a good

3311
02:15:26,461 --> 02:15:27,870
life.
So I was by myself.

3312
02:15:27,900 --> 02:15:28,740
You know,
Eric,

3313
02:15:28,741 --> 02:15:31,350
if you have kids with this young lady or
another young lady,

3314
02:15:31,390 --> 02:15:33,450
your connection with that kid will be.

3315
02:15:33,450 --> 02:15:36,450
It'll blow your fucking mind.
Change who you are.

3316
02:15:36,480 --> 02:15:37,800
I feel like that's what I've been
lacking.

3317
02:15:37,801 --> 02:15:40,860
That's why I've been more open to,
you know,

3318
02:15:41,310 --> 02:15:43,650
thinking about these kinds of things.
You seem like a dad.

3319
02:15:43,740 --> 02:15:44,310
Yeah.
Well,

3320
02:15:44,310 --> 02:15:45,950
because I'm taking a picture and your
dad right now,

3321
02:15:45,951 --> 02:15:47,400
my whole life I've been like,
you know,

3322
02:15:47,401 --> 02:15:50,250
I've been in that role for so many
people in my life right now.

3323
02:15:50,260 --> 02:15:52,170
We're holding a baby and turn it over
drunk.

3324
02:15:52,290 --> 02:15:53,220
Take you.
Yeah man.

3325
02:15:53,310 --> 02:15:55,010
I've been taking care of people like
pancakes,

3326
02:15:55,190 --> 02:15:56,970
care people my whole life,
man.

3327
02:15:56,971 --> 02:15:59,370
It's crazy.
So that's why I always feel like I

3328
02:15:59,371 --> 02:16:01,920
always feel like you have already had
one of my best friends in the world is

3329
02:16:02,010 --> 02:16:04,560
something that I've,
I've had to take care of,

3330
02:16:04,561 --> 02:16:06,580
you know,
he's had a little drinking problem and

3331
02:16:07,020 --> 02:16:08,460
yeah,
but I've been there the whole time and

3332
02:16:08,461 --> 02:16:09,690
I,
and even though people would be like,

3333
02:16:09,691 --> 02:16:10,360
you know,
you,

3334
02:16:10,360 --> 02:16:11,330
you,
you have to like,

3335
02:16:11,370 --> 02:16:12,950
you know,
the people that think that,

3336
02:16:12,951 --> 02:16:14,720
you know,
you have to hit rock bottom yet.

3337
02:16:14,760 --> 02:16:17,240
But I'm just not like that.
I've been through that too.

3338
02:16:17,241 --> 02:16:22,241
I had a very good friend of mine is my
best friend who died of heroin and he

3339
02:16:22,741 --> 02:16:24,580
was um,
uh,

3340
02:16:24,630 --> 02:16:27,030
always fucked up.
There was always something.

3341
02:16:27,031 --> 02:16:28,800
It was always.
He had a crack problem for.

3342
02:16:29,350 --> 02:16:33,820
And then he got on pills and it was,
he was either snorting it or was,

3343
02:16:33,880 --> 02:16:37,630
it was like he already lying very much.
Reminds me of this guy.

3344
02:16:37,670 --> 02:16:41,080
And Joey Diaz did a little bit too.
When I first met Joey,

3345
02:16:41,081 --> 02:16:44,980
it was like right after my friend johnny
well was right before Johnny had died.

3346
02:16:45,010 --> 02:16:49,120
Johnny was still alive,
but I had known people like joey because

3347
02:16:49,121 --> 02:16:51,140
of my friend Johnny.
But um,

3348
02:16:51,730 --> 02:16:52,563
you know,
it's just,

3349
02:16:52,870 --> 02:16:55,690
I always was there for him.
I was always trying to take care of him.

3350
02:16:55,691 --> 02:16:57,340
I was always trying to help him,
but it was just,

3351
02:16:57,550 --> 02:17:01,120
he was always,
there was always something going wrong

3352
02:17:01,180 --> 02:17:04,000
and it never is.
But there was these brief moments,

3353
02:17:04,001 --> 02:17:06,190
man,
where he'd be fine and we'd be laughing

3354
02:17:06,191 --> 02:17:08,560
and we'd have the best time and that's
why you fight for it.

3355
02:17:08,740 --> 02:17:12,490
It's those times because I was always,
I was always thinking that one day he

3356
02:17:12,491 --> 02:17:13,100
was going to get it,

3357
02:17:13,100 --> 02:17:16,830
gather I the same thing with my friend
is still going on with me right now.

3358
02:17:16,831 --> 02:17:17,664
It's like,
you know,

3359
02:17:17,750 --> 02:17:19,350
when you have,
when you deal with someone that deals

3360
02:17:19,351 --> 02:17:21,120
with depression,
real depression,

3361
02:17:21,140 --> 02:17:25,110
you know,
lost his mother and how that affected

3362
02:17:25,111 --> 02:17:28,140
his whole life and it's like,
so I'm there and he's younger than me,

3363
02:17:28,141 --> 02:17:31,980
so I feel this mentorship and I just
feel like a loyalty that I just can't

3364
02:17:31,981 --> 02:17:33,360
shake.
So I,

3365
02:17:33,361 --> 02:17:34,440
you know,
so that's that.

3366
02:17:34,441 --> 02:17:36,990
And I know what I said,
when I go to therapy I,

3367
02:17:37,200 --> 02:17:39,870
I,
I want to ask why am I this way?

3368
02:17:40,730 --> 02:17:45,730
And then I realized that comedy has been
dampering my own depressions or my own

3369
02:17:46,500 --> 02:17:48,930
feelings because I feel like I'm dealing
with it in some way.

3370
02:17:48,931 --> 02:17:53,070
So sometimes I go and talk about things
and I talk about things in a way I just

3371
02:17:53,071 --> 02:17:56,700
no holds bar because I want wanna,
I want to get this out,

3372
02:17:57,270 --> 02:17:58,510
I feel like this,
you know,

3373
02:17:58,511 --> 02:17:59,790
or if I don't like something.

3374
02:17:59,790 --> 02:18:03,870
And then combined that with we live in a
society right now where people don't

3375
02:18:03,871 --> 02:18:05,940
want to necessarily hear an opinion that
is not,

3376
02:18:05,941 --> 02:18:07,500
there's,
well,

3377
02:18:07,501 --> 02:18:09,000
there's definitely a little of that
right?

3378
02:18:09,270 --> 02:18:10,980
And so then therefore we get this.
Like,

3379
02:18:11,340 --> 02:18:14,130
it becomes tougher and tougher to do
what we do,

3380
02:18:14,131 --> 02:18:15,540
but it's not gonna stop me from doing
it,

3381
02:18:15,840 --> 02:18:17,970
but that's,
it's sweeter and sweeter when you pull

3382
02:18:17,971 --> 02:18:19,260
it off,
you know,

3383
02:18:19,261 --> 02:18:23,530
especially controversial shit.
Just got to navigate the waters.

3384
02:18:24,250 --> 02:18:26,550
What I feel like I've been,
I've been doing it.

3385
02:18:26,790 --> 02:18:30,720
I think I did it with this special.
I think I tried to talk about things in

3386
02:18:30,721 --> 02:18:31,860
a way where I was like,
okay,

3387
02:18:31,861 --> 02:18:34,440
you may not agree,
but you don't have to vilify me,

3388
02:18:34,470 --> 02:18:35,460
you know,
you don't have to like,

3389
02:18:35,461 --> 02:18:36,294
you know,
you know.

3390
02:18:36,420 --> 02:18:36,750
But,
um,

3391
02:18:36,750 --> 02:18:38,400
anyway,
it all goes back to like,

3392
02:18:38,401 --> 02:18:39,181
you know,
uh,

3393
02:18:39,181 --> 02:18:41,250
like who we are as people because of
like our,

3394
02:18:41,320 --> 02:18:42,310
our parents,
you know,

3395
02:18:42,540 --> 02:18:43,530
you know,
and it's like I,

3396
02:18:43,590 --> 02:18:44,700
my,
I love my mom.

3397
02:18:44,701 --> 02:18:46,530
I love my Stepdad.
Stepdad is a great guy.

3398
02:18:46,740 --> 02:18:48,390
I'm glad he's in my mom's life.
You know,

3399
02:18:48,391 --> 02:18:50,400
they're off in Spain right now.
They moved to Spain,

3400
02:18:50,401 --> 02:18:50,740
like,
uh,

3401
02:18:50,740 --> 02:18:53,550
like I say like a year and a half ago.
And so they're there,

3402
02:18:53,551 --> 02:18:54,630
you know,
and uh,

3403
02:18:54,650 --> 02:18:56,400
I'm,
I'm happy that she's happy in the later

3404
02:18:56,401 --> 02:18:57,690
part of her life.
That's awesome.

3405
02:18:57,900 --> 02:18:59,280
You know?
Yeah,

3406
02:18:59,340 --> 02:19:01,170
that's mean.
Look man,

3407
02:19:01,171 --> 02:19:04,410
at the end of the day it should be just
about enjoying this experience.

3408
02:19:04,470 --> 02:19:08,970
Just having time with people you care
about and enjoying it and it's hard to

3409
02:19:08,971 --> 02:19:09,410
figure it out.

3410
02:19:09,410 --> 02:19:09,890
What do.
I mean?

3411
02:19:09,890 --> 02:19:12,350
We're very,
very fortunate in a lot of ways,

3412
02:19:12,380 --> 02:19:16,590
but one of the big ones is that you and
I found comedy and you imagine.

3413
02:19:16,591 --> 02:19:18,230
I mean,
don't you tell the people sometimes they

3414
02:19:18,231 --> 02:19:19,400
go,
how the fuck they live without telling

3415
02:19:19,401 --> 02:19:20,234
me

3416
02:19:21,340 --> 02:19:26,340
how do they live without killing?
When I see some bullshit happened tv I

3417
02:19:27,561 --> 02:19:28,100
go,
that guy

3418
02:19:28,100 --> 02:19:31,370
needs to go do an open mic set.
You need to go get that out man.

3419
02:19:31,430 --> 02:19:32,630
Go get that out.
Well,

3420
02:19:32,690 --> 02:19:35,390
you know that feeling that you get like
Friday night and the,

3421
02:19:35,391 --> 02:19:38,990
Oh,
are you just mash and you get off stage?

3422
02:19:38,991 --> 02:19:42,320
You're like telling me there's a better
feeling of it because whatever I was

3423
02:19:42,321 --> 02:19:43,790
feeling,
it all goes away.

3424
02:19:43,870 --> 02:19:45,530
Yeah,
but that's why I feel like.

3425
02:19:45,590 --> 02:19:46,540
I do think though,
there's,

3426
02:19:46,550 --> 02:19:50,000
sometimes we're like putting a damper on
it and it doesn't necessarily go away,

3427
02:19:50,210 --> 02:19:52,460
but we found another outlet to get it
out.

3428
02:19:52,550 --> 02:19:54,800
Well,
you just got a little toxic hating man.

3429
02:19:54,830 --> 02:19:57,230
You take it a little happy pill,
but you know,

3430
02:19:57,231 --> 02:20:00,320
like there's happiness and all sorts of
things that you enjoy doing.

3431
02:20:00,460 --> 02:20:05,460
I found I've tried to fill my life up
with activities that I enjoy doing,

3432
02:20:06,080 --> 02:20:07,820
but family is a big one too.
Man.

3433
02:20:07,850 --> 02:20:08,900
Family is,
um,

3434
02:20:09,860 --> 02:20:11,540
it's a,
it's a different thing,

3435
02:20:11,541 --> 02:20:12,440
man.
It changes you.

3436
02:20:12,460 --> 02:20:14,330
You and I'm all.
I have all daughters.

3437
02:20:14,720 --> 02:20:17,300
It's all my house is off.
It's so feminine.

3438
02:20:17,301 --> 02:20:18,950
Everything's females.
So,

3439
02:20:19,030 --> 02:20:20,720
I mean,
I've talked about it on my special,

3440
02:20:21,110 --> 02:20:21,730
about,
you know,

3441
02:20:21,730 --> 02:20:23,580
the Bruce Jenner thing about,
you know,

3442
02:20:23,800 --> 02:20:25,250
that uh,
my last special,

3443
02:20:25,280 --> 02:20:28,400
the one before this one,
that it's just that if you live with

3444
02:20:28,401 --> 02:20:30,220
crazy bitches long enough eventually
become.

3445
02:20:32,710 --> 02:20:37,370
I am becoming more and more familiar
with a more feminine version of

3446
02:20:37,371 --> 02:20:38,630
yourself.
Oh my God.

3447
02:20:38,631 --> 02:20:41,000
I'm so much more feminine than I've ever
been,

3448
02:20:41,090 --> 02:20:46,090
ever so much more in tune with how girls
think so much more tolerant of like

3449
02:20:46,280 --> 02:20:50,000
nonsense talk because like when you're
talking nonsense talk,

3450
02:20:50,001 --> 02:20:52,980
it's just different,
but it's just like you realize like if,

3451
02:20:53,710 --> 02:20:56,280
if I'm around like women when they're
talking together and I'm going to

3452
02:20:56,281 --> 02:20:59,870
observe her and I wash them,
they just talk about different shit man.

3453
02:21:00,350 --> 02:21:03,470
I mean there.
And then when we've just talked about

3454
02:21:03,471 --> 02:21:06,590
different shift for two hours,
if you like,

3455
02:21:06,591 --> 02:21:08,360
try to interject,
interject and go,

3456
02:21:08,361 --> 02:21:10,550
Hey,
do you guys see that bare knuckle boxing

3457
02:21:10,551 --> 02:21:13,260
fight was fucking awesome.
Like let's get away from the.

3458
02:21:13,280 --> 02:21:14,000
Yeah.
Yeah.

3459
02:21:14,000 --> 02:21:17,630
Like for them,
what you're interested in is stupid and

3460
02:21:17,631 --> 02:21:18,411
for them,
you know,

3461
02:21:18,411 --> 02:21:19,700
they,
they want to talk about whatever the

3462
02:21:19,701 --> 02:21:21,650
fuck they want to talk about that
they're into at the moment.

3463
02:21:21,650 --> 02:21:25,820
Whether it's shoes of the royal wedding
or what relationships have had been in a

3464
02:21:25,821 --> 02:21:28,400
relationship for this long now has
taught me patience,

3465
02:21:28,430 --> 02:21:30,020
patience.
It's taught me patience.

3466
02:21:30,050 --> 02:21:35,050
It taught me like that too.
Except the double standard that things

3467
02:21:35,271 --> 02:21:38,090
aren't supposed to necessarily be equal
that they're supposed to be.

3468
02:21:38,130 --> 02:21:40,430
I always think that it's one of those
scales,

3469
02:21:40,460 --> 02:21:43,490
you know,
and you put stuff in the scale on this

3470
02:21:43,491 --> 02:21:47,180
side and she puts different things,
but that's how you balance out.

3471
02:21:47,600 --> 02:21:49,460
But they don't have to be the same
thing.

3472
02:21:49,910 --> 02:21:52,400
You know,
people don't give love in the same way,

3473
02:21:52,610 --> 02:21:55,550
so you shouldn't accept.
You shouldn't expect it to be the way

3474
02:21:55,551 --> 02:21:57,650
you give it,
but that becomes a problem.

3475
02:21:57,830 --> 02:21:59,000
You know,
that becomes a problem.

3476
02:21:59,001 --> 02:22:01,990
I had a girlfriend once that she,
she didn't express love in a way that

3477
02:22:02,010 --> 02:22:04,800
was like hugging and she didn't want to
do it that way.

3478
02:22:04,810 --> 02:22:06,350
She wasn't affectionate,
she wasn't affectionate.

3479
02:22:06,351 --> 02:22:08,690
She like,
she buy me a TV or something,

3480
02:22:09,050 --> 02:22:13,760
you know,
but it's so weird and I understood

3481
02:22:13,761 --> 02:22:16,250
though because it was because her family
wasn't like that.

3482
02:22:16,251 --> 02:22:17,070
They weren't.
It wasn't.

3483
02:22:17,070 --> 02:22:19,130
They weren't a huggy people,
but I was,

3484
02:22:19,210 --> 02:22:21,650
don't feel sad for people like that.
That I do.

3485
02:22:21,810 --> 02:22:24,260
I do is we need human interaction
interaction.

3486
02:22:24,261 --> 02:22:25,770
We need to connection.
We need to,

3487
02:22:26,430 --> 02:22:28,230
we need to feel,
you know,

3488
02:22:28,231 --> 02:22:30,870
we need to feel that.
And then we also need smiles.

3489
02:22:30,900 --> 02:22:33,210
We need smiles from people.
I was telling my girlfriend,

3490
02:22:33,211 --> 02:22:35,400
like,
you know that you're the most beautiful

3491
02:22:35,401 --> 02:22:36,000
when you're just,
like,

3492
02:22:36,000 --> 02:22:38,030
happy and smiling because the moment she
isn't,

3493
02:22:38,040 --> 02:22:38,970
it's like,
what did I do

3494
02:22:42,420 --> 02:22:44,470
that shit.
I know what you did.

3495
02:22:44,500 --> 02:22:48,300
I wonder if she's mad and she.
Is She mad about this?

3496
02:22:48,670 --> 02:22:51,400
I know she's mad.
What did I do or,

3497
02:22:51,450 --> 02:22:53,670
or what does she think I did preemptive?

3498
02:22:53,760 --> 02:22:55,380
Like if I do that,
will she get mad?

3499
02:22:55,440 --> 02:22:56,790
Oh my God,
do I know

3500
02:22:59,060 --> 02:23:01,630
it's like a divinci code,
man.

3501
02:23:01,890 --> 02:23:03,780
We're just trying to figure out.
And that's what I'm learning with her.

3502
02:23:03,781 --> 02:23:07,260
But I remember I was,
I was with a girl that I was dating at

3503
02:23:07,261 --> 02:23:08,790
the time.
I was in my twenties.

3504
02:23:08,791 --> 02:23:13,170
I was very young at the time and uh,
I was with a couple of my buddies and we

3505
02:23:13,171 --> 02:23:18,120
were talking and this guy was,
he was bringing up that this guy was

3506
02:23:18,121 --> 02:23:20,520
having some crazy problem with his
girlfriend.

3507
02:23:20,850 --> 02:23:21,840
And I said,
Oh yeah,

3508
02:23:21,841 --> 02:23:22,690
I go,
she's,

3509
02:23:23,260 --> 02:23:24,630
I go,
she's crazy,

3510
02:23:24,631 --> 02:23:27,000
and here's the problem.
He didn't want to get rid of it because

3511
02:23:27,001 --> 02:23:29,130
she's fucking hot.
And I go,

3512
02:23:29,131 --> 02:23:32,520
she's like,
who's that girl from real housewives?

3513
02:23:32,970 --> 02:23:36,870
Real housewives or desperate housewives?
Terry what?

3514
02:23:37,500 --> 02:23:41,550
Teri hatcher.
This was back like she was in one of

3515
02:23:41,551 --> 02:23:45,270
those fucking movies,
one of those summer movies way back in

3516
02:23:45,271 --> 02:23:46,104
the day.

3517
02:23:46,170 --> 02:23:47,820
You know,
Teri Hatcher is a few years older than

3518
02:23:47,821 --> 02:23:49,290
me.
So this was like,

3519
02:23:49,410 --> 02:23:50,243
well,
I'm talking this,

3520
02:23:50,610 --> 02:23:52,590
this conversation took place in the
nineties.

3521
02:23:52,860 --> 02:23:56,310
So I,
I think the way I described a den,

3522
02:23:56,340 --> 02:24:01,270
I said like a young Teri hatcher and
this girl got so mad,

3523
02:24:02,610 --> 02:24:06,180
she got so mad at me that I use Teri
Hatcher,

3524
02:24:06,390 --> 02:24:10,620
a young Teri hatcher to describe.
And I remember sitting there going,

3525
02:24:10,621 --> 02:24:11,540
what?
What?

3526
02:24:11,550 --> 02:24:12,383
I just said,
Oh,

3527
02:24:12,800 --> 02:24:15,300
here's your,
you're such an asshole.

3528
02:24:15,390 --> 02:24:16,560
And I'm like,
what did I do?

3529
02:24:16,650 --> 02:24:19,530
I was talking about,
this guy's got a girlfriend who's hot.

3530
02:24:20,040 --> 02:24:21,870
She's hot,
like a young Teri hatcher.

3531
02:24:21,871 --> 02:24:24,000
There she is.
Oh yeah.

3532
02:24:24,250 --> 02:24:26,340
Too stupid.
Hot,

3533
02:24:26,490 --> 02:24:31,350
confusing.
But she was in like some movie where I

3534
02:24:31,351 --> 02:24:35,670
forget what the fuck the premise of the
movie was,

3535
02:24:35,671 --> 02:24:38,130
but there was a guy in the movie that
couldn't do,

3536
02:24:38,131 --> 02:24:40,540
couldn't deal with the fact that she was
telling cash.

3537
02:24:40,920 --> 02:24:42,570
Confused.
Anyway.

3538
02:24:42,960 --> 02:24:46,050
Um,
my point is this,

3539
02:24:46,140 --> 02:24:47,400
I didn't get it.
I was like,

3540
02:24:47,401 --> 02:24:50,010
what did I do wrong?
Of course she was mad that I didn't use

3541
02:24:50,011 --> 02:24:53,520
her as an example of someone really hot.
Oh God.

3542
02:24:54,270 --> 02:24:57,830
Sometimes she was familiar with.
Sometimes I know now see here's a

3543
02:24:57,840 --> 02:25:00,360
problem as comics,
like we were like,

3544
02:25:00,680 --> 02:25:01,231
uh,
you know,

3545
02:25:01,231 --> 02:25:06,000
we like to think in logical ways,
but we also like to analyze things.

3546
02:25:06,340 --> 02:25:08,330
So like,
you know,

3547
02:25:08,370 --> 02:25:10,070
so like she asks like,
Oh,

3548
02:25:10,410 --> 02:25:13,680
if I feel ugly or you have to be like,
you have to know at that moment,

3549
02:25:13,800 --> 02:25:16,080
oh,
is she fishing for me to say

3550
02:25:16,110 --> 02:25:18,050
compliments?
Compliment or if like,

3551
02:25:18,150 --> 02:25:21,540
or like she just woke up and sometimes
you just,

3552
02:25:21,600 --> 02:25:23,100
you,
you have to just be like,

3553
02:25:23,140 --> 02:25:23,980
oh,
you look so great

3554
02:25:23,980 --> 02:25:26,260
today.
I think you've got to preemptively just

3555
02:25:26,261 --> 02:25:28,260
throw those in there.
Just just,

3556
02:25:28,380 --> 02:25:31,670
just fucking decorate the plate with it.
Here's the thing,

3557
02:25:31,950 --> 02:25:36,950
and you know what's weird,
she knows you don't believe it at this

3558
02:25:37,871 --> 02:25:39,310
particular time.
I think she's beautiful.

3559
02:25:39,380 --> 02:25:39,561
No,
no,

3560
02:25:39,561 --> 02:25:39,781
no,
no,

3561
02:25:39,781 --> 02:25:40,230
no,
no,

3562
02:25:40,230 --> 02:25:40,511
no,
no.

3563
02:25:40,511 --> 02:25:42,000
I'm not saying fucked up.
No,

3564
02:25:42,020 --> 02:25:47,020
I'm saying she's going to know now
I'm talking about fucking bullshit.

3565
02:25:47,630 --> 02:25:51,040
I think they know when they just need it
and they know,

3566
02:25:51,041 --> 02:25:54,100
you know,
they want you to know that they just

3567
02:25:54,101 --> 02:25:57,310
need this right now whether you want to
or not.

3568
02:25:57,730 --> 02:26:00,490
They just know they,
they know that and then that's what

3569
02:26:00,491 --> 02:26:02,260
they're really connected to.
Oh,

3570
02:26:02,261 --> 02:26:04,980
he's doing what he was doing that thing
for me to,

3571
02:26:05,110 --> 02:26:05,943
for me.
Right.

3572
02:26:06,190 --> 02:26:08,650
That's all it is.
Do this for me.

3573
02:26:08,710 --> 02:26:10,210
And some girls don't need that shit at
all.

3574
02:26:11,110 --> 02:26:12,550
Some girls just don't need it.
They're like,

3575
02:26:12,551 --> 02:26:15,400
hey shit,
that wasn't nice.

3576
02:26:15,401 --> 02:26:19,360
Something else go like,
you save that,

3577
02:26:19,810 --> 02:26:21,430
save that and get that deck ready.

3578
02:26:23,600 --> 02:26:27,580
Been dating the girl in her twenties is,
is uh,

3579
02:26:27,620 --> 02:26:29,170
you know,
that's why I had to start doing boxing

3580
02:26:29,180 --> 02:26:32,160
because it's 15.
Like I said,

3581
02:26:32,910 --> 02:26:33,521
yeah.
I gotta like,

3582
02:26:33,521 --> 02:26:34,354
you know,
I'm like,

3583
02:26:34,510 --> 02:26:36,160
I got the things I have to do after
work.

3584
02:26:36,161 --> 02:26:37,150
Magic,
you know what I mean?

3585
02:26:37,540 --> 02:26:38,111
Yeah,
man,

3586
02:26:38,111 --> 02:26:41,470
because in a few years,
I mean that's the thing is like there's

3587
02:26:41,490 --> 02:26:45,370
a definite deterioration of your
physical being as you get into your

3588
02:26:45,371 --> 02:26:47,500
forties.
If you don't keep up,

3589
02:26:48,110 --> 02:26:51,160
if you keep looking at me,
if you keep it fun,

3590
02:26:51,161 --> 02:26:52,210
cuddly guy.
But I gotta get.

3591
02:26:52,211 --> 02:26:53,410
I gotta get there.
It's so.

3592
02:26:53,990 --> 02:26:55,240
It's my fault.
I put,

3593
02:26:55,270 --> 02:26:58,720
I put on weight,
so I walked by a donut shop and our gain

3594
02:26:58,721 --> 02:27:00,010
like two pounds.
What do you eat?

3595
02:27:00,430 --> 02:27:02,350
I just a horrible.
Horrible.

3596
02:27:02,380 --> 02:27:03,213
Yeah,
that's the thing.

3597
02:27:03,260 --> 02:27:04,160
Yeah.
So you die.

3598
02:27:04,161 --> 02:27:05,040
It's not good.
Now die.

3599
02:27:05,050 --> 02:27:06,600
I've got to get that dialed in gear,
but I don't,

3600
02:27:07,030 --> 02:27:08,200
I don't mind eating wild.

3601
02:27:08,220 --> 02:27:09,340
No.
My problem is this,

3602
02:27:09,341 --> 02:27:11,260
if it's in front of my plate,
if it's all my plate,

3603
02:27:11,261 --> 02:27:15,640
I'll eat it.
So I have to cut down on what's on my

3604
02:27:15,641 --> 02:27:16,361
plate.
Well,

3605
02:27:16,361 --> 02:27:17,770
when I met you,
you were thinner.

3606
02:27:18,280 --> 02:27:19,040
Yeah,
but I am.

3607
02:27:19,040 --> 02:27:21,910
My weight has always fluctuated.
You know why I remember this?

3608
02:27:21,911 --> 02:27:23,650
I'll never forget this.
We both a good friend,

3609
02:27:23,651 --> 02:27:26,080
Ari Shaffir.
I'm in the hallway at the comedy store.

3610
02:27:26,081 --> 02:27:29,710
I just got back from the Middle East,
so I was eating like a fucking Arab

3611
02:27:29,711 --> 02:27:32,650
prince over there.
Just just a fat fuck.

3612
02:27:32,651 --> 02:27:36,730
When I came back,
I've been mid conversation with Ari and

3613
02:27:36,731 --> 02:27:40,690
in conversation he leans over and he
grabs my cheek.

3614
02:27:43,550 --> 02:27:45,090
I'm talking about my car.
He,

3615
02:27:45,140 --> 02:27:47,560
he,
he grabs my cheek and he goes like this.

3616
02:27:47,680 --> 02:27:49,090
He squeezes it and he goes,
hey,

3617
02:27:49,240 --> 02:27:52,870
what's going on?
Let me say something.

3618
02:27:52,930 --> 02:27:57,880
Let me say something.
I went to the gym the next day and I

3619
02:27:57,881 --> 02:27:59,140
signed up with,
with a,

3620
02:27:59,160 --> 02:28:02,980
with a personal trainer like that next
day because the way he did it,

3621
02:28:04,090 --> 02:28:05,110
I was like,
Oh shit.

3622
02:28:05,111 --> 02:28:05,950
It was like,
I forgot.

3623
02:28:05,951 --> 02:28:08,260
So I had to just get back to it.
I just been comfortable.

3624
02:28:08,380 --> 02:28:09,340
Well,
he's a comic,

3625
02:28:09,770 --> 02:28:11,140
you know,
he saw vulnerability.

3626
02:28:11,260 --> 02:28:11,850
Oh yeah,
yeah,

3627
02:28:11,850 --> 02:28:13,870
yeah.
The devil that he is

3628
02:28:16,440 --> 02:28:18,680
just hire a train.
But the thing is man,

3629
02:28:18,681 --> 02:28:21,110
just I'm doing the box and man,
I just started to box and I can.

3630
02:28:21,140 --> 02:28:22,250
You can get someone to

3631
02:28:22,280 --> 02:28:25,370
do like meal plans for you.
I know there's a bunch of those

3632
02:28:25,371 --> 02:28:27,580
companies that will make you healthy to
keep.

3633
02:28:27,650 --> 02:28:29,000
Yeah,
you keep them in the fridge.

3634
02:28:29,040 --> 02:28:29,520
See,
I,

3635
02:28:29,520 --> 02:28:33,290
I want to just do it.
I know I can because I've done it on

3636
02:28:33,291 --> 02:28:33,921
your own.
Yeah,

3637
02:28:33,921 --> 02:28:35,270
I did.
I was Vegan for a year,

3638
02:28:35,830 --> 02:28:36,860
you know,
because I did it.

3639
02:28:36,861 --> 02:28:39,020
I was my God,
I was crazy.

3640
02:28:39,021 --> 02:28:41,720
But you don't want to mess me up as I
did at the end of the year.

3641
02:28:41,721 --> 02:28:44,270
I did that master cleanse.
What's a master cleanse?

3642
02:28:44,390 --> 02:28:49,390
Remember the master cleanse with Cayenne
pepper and a and a maple syrup and

3643
02:28:50,210 --> 02:28:51,940
that's all you ate for a week.
Okay.

3644
02:28:52,080 --> 02:28:54,740
Okay.
That shit I did it for.

3645
02:28:55,200 --> 02:28:57,770
He's supposed to have a 10 days.
I got to day five.

3646
02:28:58,010 --> 02:29:01,610
Then the two days of you got to let your
body get used to like having salad and

3647
02:29:01,611 --> 02:29:03,960
soup.
And then I had a fat burger who like,

3648
02:29:03,970 --> 02:29:04,470
I was bad.

3649
02:29:04,470 --> 02:29:07,130
I went from not eating meat from a year,
but you know,

3650
02:29:07,131 --> 02:29:10,580
what I learned from being Vegan for a
year is that the meat is not

3651
02:29:10,581 --> 02:29:12,920
necessarily.
The main course is just a side dish with

3652
02:29:12,921 --> 02:29:15,800
everything else.
So if you have a good thing of Broccoli,

3653
02:29:15,890 --> 02:29:17,030
a good thing,
corn,

3654
02:29:17,031 --> 02:29:19,670
a good thing of mushrooms,
and then you have a good thing,

3655
02:29:19,671 --> 02:29:23,840
a steak that you don't have to have the
steak and then you could have some great

3656
02:29:23,841 --> 02:29:25,550
side dishes.
Okay,

3657
02:29:25,610 --> 02:29:27,740
well there's a lot of people that eat
carnivore diet now,

3658
02:29:27,770 --> 02:29:29,270
so a lot of people that are eating just
meat.

3659
02:29:30,080 --> 02:29:33,200
Very interesting.
I think it's all about moderation,

3660
02:29:33,201 --> 02:29:34,130
man.
I don't know.

3661
02:29:34,290 --> 02:29:36,680
You don't even notice.
It's different for different people,

3662
02:29:37,070 --> 02:29:39,320
but you work out your workout guy.
You got to work out a lot.

3663
02:29:40,210 --> 02:29:43,220
You got monkey bars out there.
I've been working out twice a day.

3664
02:29:43,360 --> 02:29:44,180
Well,
there you go.

3665
02:29:44,180 --> 02:29:47,960
My main thing is one hard workout a day
and one less,

3666
02:29:48,020 --> 02:29:50,120
less hard workout a day.
Now if you think,

3667
02:29:50,121 --> 02:29:53,000
if you didn't do that,
that your physical,

3668
02:29:53,060 --> 02:29:57,290
your physical physically change.
I would diminish for sure because when I

3669
02:29:57,291 --> 02:29:59,300
take time off,
if I take time off,

3670
02:29:59,301 --> 02:30:01,400
I,
I noticed diminishing maybe,

3671
02:30:01,460 --> 02:30:06,460
but maybe that,
but also let's say how proper or average

3672
02:30:07,971 --> 02:30:10,400
health or even above average health is
here.

3673
02:30:10,730 --> 02:30:13,760
Maybe what you're doing brings you up
here,

3674
02:30:14,150 --> 02:30:15,680
so that diminishing you're talking
about,

3675
02:30:15,681 --> 02:30:18,380
it's just going to bring you to a more
average normal level,

3676
02:30:18,381 --> 02:30:19,940
but still in great shape.
Yeah.

3677
02:30:19,941 --> 02:30:21,410
Maybe you're.
Maybe you're overdoing it.

3678
02:30:21,440 --> 02:30:24,740
I'm just wondering if we're doing it
because I monitor everything.

3679
02:30:24,741 --> 02:30:28,340
I'm making sure that my health is good
and my body's in good shape,

3680
02:30:28,341 --> 02:30:30,260
but I just know that if you don't use
it,

3681
02:30:30,261 --> 02:30:30,950
you lose it.

3682
02:30:30,950 --> 02:30:33,620
There's just a fact that and when I say
a workout twice a day,

3683
02:30:33,621 --> 02:30:37,550
what it means is usually I'll do yoga
during the day and then at night I'll

3684
02:30:37,551 --> 02:30:42,200
lift some weights or I'll run the hills
and then at night I'll lift weights.

3685
02:30:42,201 --> 02:30:44,240
You're not doing a navy seal workout
twice a day?

3686
02:30:44,270 --> 02:30:44,591
No,
no,

3687
02:30:44,591 --> 02:30:45,110
no.
One.

3688
02:30:45,110 --> 02:30:48,830
One of the workouts is like pretty calm.
The weightlifting workouts are almost

3689
02:30:48,831 --> 02:30:53,210
always pretty calm unless I'm doing like
a cardio kettlebell workout or something

3690
02:30:53,211 --> 02:30:56,620
intense at this gym they have.
You could do the boxing and then another

3691
02:30:56,620 --> 02:30:59,750
days you can come and you could do like
a a weight training.

3692
02:30:59,820 --> 02:31:02,560
I'm an active weights and that kind of
stuff,

3693
02:31:02,570 --> 02:31:03,800
so I'm going to start doing that one
too.

3694
02:31:03,860 --> 02:31:06,210
I bet.
A big thing with you is just what you're

3695
02:31:06,230 --> 02:31:07,930
eating,
bro.

3696
02:31:08,440 --> 02:31:11,750
Yeah.
The animal cookies to the circus animal

3697
02:31:11,751 --> 02:31:13,580
cookies I have in my kitchen right now.
Good.

3698
02:31:13,880 --> 02:31:14,990
It's not good.
Not good,

3699
02:31:15,110 --> 02:31:19,010
but if they come in these little packs,
but I have a pack of 50 so every time I

3700
02:31:19,020 --> 02:31:19,980
have one I think,
well I'm only

3701
02:31:20,060 --> 02:31:21,510
habit.
Get it.

3702
02:31:21,570 --> 02:31:22,231
You know,
so I,

3703
02:31:22,231 --> 02:31:23,460
I have to.
I love to eat.

3704
02:31:23,510 --> 02:31:26,250
I'm going not just to,
but the way get calls on me so fast.

3705
02:31:26,251 --> 02:31:29,340
It's so annoying that it just sits in my
gut area.

3706
02:31:29,460 --> 02:31:31,260
Especially as you get shaped like an
ostrich.

3707
02:31:31,261 --> 02:31:34,350
It's hard to know what I mean.
I'm big in the middle,

3708
02:31:34,450 --> 02:31:36,600
middle legs.
That's harder and harder as you go.

3709
02:31:36,650 --> 02:31:38,280
Oh,
that's what's happening right now.

3710
02:31:38,281 --> 02:31:40,500
I got to stop.
That's why you got to keep up.

3711
02:31:40,530 --> 02:31:41,490
That's the whole thing.
No,

3712
02:31:41,491 --> 02:31:43,800
man.
You got to maintain like I work on my

3713
02:31:43,801 --> 02:31:46,050
comedy.
I have to work on my physical.

3714
02:31:46,051 --> 02:31:47,460
At the same time,
you'll feel better.

3715
02:31:47,750 --> 02:31:51,930
I want to feel that way more energy to
cut out the sugar grains.

3716
02:31:52,020 --> 02:31:55,260
Here we go with the sugar to cut out
sugar and grains,

3717
02:31:55,261 --> 02:31:58,620
you'll lose 30 pounds.
Cut out everything that is delicious.

3718
02:31:58,630 --> 02:32:01,290
Just eat salads and fish.
Eat healthy.

3719
02:32:01,380 --> 02:32:03,930
Have some red meat,
but in moderation.

3720
02:32:04,040 --> 02:32:06,050
Don't eat crazy.
I'm holding on fries.

3721
02:32:06,120 --> 02:32:07,740
A lot of chicken.
A lot of fries.

3722
02:32:07,870 --> 02:32:09,930
Drink a lot of water.
Fries are bullshit.

3723
02:32:10,260 --> 02:32:14,610
Mostly potatoes and oil.
Could he get none of that?

3724
02:32:14,611 --> 02:32:15,670
Really?
We.

3725
02:32:15,671 --> 02:32:17,820
We have.
When's the last time you had some fries?

3726
02:32:18,470 --> 02:32:19,303
Yeah,
exactly.

3727
02:32:20,360 --> 02:32:22,380
Yeah,
but you just can't.

3728
02:32:22,470 --> 02:32:24,300
Can't,
can't have it all the time.

3729
02:32:24,330 --> 02:32:28,310
I know.
Moderators all moderation mattering.

3730
02:32:28,350 --> 02:32:31,630
Night it in a nice Italian restaurant.
It's a pasta last night.

3731
02:32:32,620 --> 02:32:34,410
Fuck.
Narrow Salsa.

3732
02:32:34,420 --> 02:32:36,150
Some shrimp.
It was delicious.

3733
02:32:36,180 --> 02:32:38,040
We just had the same meal I had last
night.

3734
02:32:38,060 --> 02:32:42,600
Yeah,
I do follow World Diablo.

3735
02:32:42,690 --> 02:32:46,410
Diablo
the devil's in the details.

3736
02:32:46,790 --> 02:32:47,820
Yeah.
I like.

3737
02:32:47,821 --> 02:32:48,654
It.
Tastes good,

3738
02:32:48,660 --> 02:32:51,150
but I just don't allow myself to do it
very often.

3739
02:32:51,210 --> 02:32:53,490
Most of the time I eat real clean.
Good for you.

3740
02:32:53,870 --> 02:32:54,830
I'm trying to get their body.

3741
02:32:54,870 --> 02:32:55,703
You could do it.
I know.

3742
02:32:55,710 --> 02:32:58,200
Don't get defensive.
I've done it.

3743
02:32:58,201 --> 02:33:01,110
I'm in your corner.
I'm not going to feel angry.

3744
02:33:01,240 --> 02:33:05,370
Is Mad at me because I know I should be
doing to run out of here and go right to

3745
02:33:05,371 --> 02:33:06,330
the gym.
I'm just going.

3746
02:33:06,350 --> 02:33:07,860
I'm not going to leave the building.
I'm just gonna.

3747
02:33:07,861 --> 02:33:09,660
Go right over there.
That's what I'm saying.

3748
02:33:10,250 --> 02:33:12,690
Building plenty of equipment.
We could work out side by side.

3749
02:33:12,870 --> 02:33:15,960
I know I should have brought my stuff.
I got stuff for you.

3750
02:33:16,010 --> 02:33:18,120
And of course this is just me trying to
get out of it already.

3751
02:33:18,830 --> 02:33:21,350
You know what I mean?
Joe,

3752
02:33:21,360 --> 02:33:24,330
I got my shoes.
I didn't bring my orthopedics.

3753
02:33:24,660 --> 02:33:27,160
I think for comics it's like it's,
it's,

3754
02:33:27,210 --> 02:33:30,480
it's important to alleviate a certain
amount of angst.

3755
02:33:30,630 --> 02:33:34,060
You want to go on stage with a certain
amount when you're upset and you know,

3756
02:33:34,061 --> 02:33:37,140
you like pissed off and shit,
but you don't want to go upset onstage

3757
02:33:37,170 --> 02:33:37,890
hating yourself.

3758
02:33:37,890 --> 02:33:38,820
Right.
You know,

3759
02:33:39,640 --> 02:33:41,280
I don't like comics that go onstage
drunk,

3760
02:33:41,560 --> 02:33:43,380
right?
I don't like how they they need this

3761
02:33:43,381 --> 02:33:47,280
alcohol or or,
or people that think we'd like people to

3762
02:33:47,281 --> 02:33:50,760
think we like out of my saying,
weed makes you lazy,

3763
02:33:51,450 --> 02:33:54,030
but lazy people shouldn't smoke week.
Ryan.

3764
02:33:54,031 --> 02:33:55,170
I know what you're saying.
Well,

3765
02:33:55,171 --> 02:33:58,200
as a person who smokes weed,
it really bothers me because I'm not

3766
02:33:58,201 --> 02:34:02,820
lazy at all and I just,
I hate that connection between lazy

3767
02:34:02,821 --> 02:34:04,530
people in week because I don't think
that's.

3768
02:34:04,620 --> 02:34:05,970
I don't think that's what makes you
lazy.

3769
02:34:06,000 --> 02:34:06,833
No,
no,

3770
02:34:07,530 --> 02:34:09,720
I agree.
That's why I'm saying I'm not saying it

3771
02:34:09,721 --> 02:34:10,920
makes you lazy,
you know,

3772
02:34:10,980 --> 02:34:12,930
but if you're already lazy and then you
do.

3773
02:34:12,931 --> 02:34:15,480
This is not going to be a winning
combination.

3774
02:34:15,510 --> 02:34:17,580
It's not just that it just looks
because.

3775
02:34:17,740 --> 02:34:19,750
And you blame it on the week.
Jr Smith,

3776
02:34:19,810 --> 02:34:21,730
I think.
I think that was a weed situations.

3777
02:34:21,730 --> 02:34:23,330
Gerrit Smith from the.
No,

3778
02:34:23,920 --> 02:34:25,240
you don't even know.
Cleveland capital.

3779
02:34:25,241 --> 02:34:28,450
Jerry jumps into press the microphone.
I don't know what we're talking about.

3780
02:34:30,300 --> 02:34:33,290
Cable Cavaliers.
He did something really stupid.

3781
02:34:33,291 --> 02:34:35,470
He was like two.
It was like three,

3782
02:34:35,471 --> 02:34:38,080
four seconds left there.
Their tie ballgame.

3783
02:34:38,260 --> 02:34:40,520
Right.
One of the other guys that the fleet,

3784
02:34:40,521 --> 02:34:44,500
the why he misses the free throw,
Jr Smith grabs the ball instead of

3785
02:34:44,501 --> 02:34:48,400
putting it up to win the game,
he dribbles out because he thought that

3786
02:34:48,401 --> 02:34:51,820
they were up and the look on his face
was like that.

3787
02:34:51,821 --> 02:34:53,020
Kinda like,
I've seen this.

3788
02:34:53,021 --> 02:34:54,520
Hi Look,
I'm not saying he,

3789
02:34:55,060 --> 02:34:58,960
but I heard stories that he smokes a lot
of weed.

3790
02:34:59,140 --> 02:35:00,940
So.
And I'm saying like those weed people

3791
02:35:00,941 --> 02:35:02,380
out there,
like there's an example of it.

3792
02:35:02,620 --> 02:35:04,630
There are brilliant people that smoke
weed.

3793
02:35:04,810 --> 02:35:08,380
They are successful.
The look on his face.

3794
02:35:08,900 --> 02:35:11,860
What the fuck man?
First of all,

3795
02:35:12,010 --> 02:35:13,630
how Jack is Lebraun.

3796
02:35:13,660 --> 02:35:17,620
Look at those fucking six,
nine to 50,

3797
02:35:17,621 --> 02:35:19,510
probably six percent.
Body fat.

3798
02:35:19,570 --> 02:35:22,330
The shoulders on that 33 years old.
Two.

3799
02:35:22,960 --> 02:35:24,240
And he's getting better.
Yes.

3800
02:35:24,280 --> 02:35:26,680
It's unbelievable.
Shoulders are fucking epic.

3801
02:35:26,830 --> 02:35:29,020
Yeah man.
There's another picture of him like

3802
02:35:29,021 --> 02:35:31,240
straight on where he lives.
He literally looks like an Avenger.

3803
02:35:31,440 --> 02:35:34,720
Like it could be like some sort of like,
keep him the fuck away from Jeff

3804
02:35:34,720 --> 02:35:35,850
Novitsky.
Look at the picture,

3805
02:35:35,870 --> 02:35:36,940
look at their picture of them right
there.

3806
02:35:36,941 --> 02:35:39,300
That one word,
Jeremy Smith is smiling too.

3807
02:35:39,840 --> 02:35:44,370
We'd look on high as fuck.
Oh,

3808
02:35:44,380 --> 02:35:48,100
that's a high guy.
And I think that owners understand other

3809
02:35:48,101 --> 02:35:49,900
stoners.
I think he got like a.

3810
02:35:49,930 --> 02:35:51,570
He had a little blame,
a brain slip.

3811
02:35:51,580 --> 02:35:52,840
I guarantee he did,
you know,

3812
02:35:53,510 --> 02:35:55,930
pain.
You $17,000,000 or they paid him off to

3813
02:35:55,931 --> 02:35:58,630
try to drag it into seven games high as
fuck.

3814
02:35:58,720 --> 02:36:01,630
You guys go.
That's boom.

3815
02:36:01,840 --> 02:36:02,631
That's him.
Yeah.

3816
02:36:02,631 --> 02:36:04,840
But there's plenty of pictures of me
that looked like that to where I'm

3817
02:36:04,841 --> 02:36:06,830
sober.
They didn't catch you.

3818
02:36:06,850 --> 02:36:10,060
You could just blanket.
You could just look up jared Smith.

3819
02:36:10,061 --> 02:36:12,070
Hi.
I'm sure there's a website so he smokes

3820
02:36:12,071 --> 02:36:12,904
a lot of weed.

3821
02:36:14,680 --> 02:36:15,970
Smoking weed.
There you go.

3822
02:36:16,270 --> 02:36:19,510
Well this doesn't like one of those
things with the MBA has it in their

3823
02:36:19,511 --> 02:36:22,060
contract that they don't test for weed.
They do tests,

3824
02:36:22,061 --> 02:36:25,540
but it's not as stringent as everywhere
they test for weed.

3825
02:36:26,260 --> 02:36:31,260
But these guys are all getting high.
Like it's the locker room for a pool

3826
02:36:31,840 --> 02:36:32,490
for,
you know,

3827
02:36:32,490 --> 02:36:36,310
I told you I play pool pool.
Marijuana is a performance enhancing

3828
02:36:36,311 --> 02:36:37,360
drug.
One hundred percent.

3829
02:36:37,390 --> 02:36:39,730
It makes me my game.
Don't believe you,

3830
02:36:39,760 --> 02:36:41,290
you don't have to.
I'm telling you,

3831
02:36:41,440 --> 02:36:44,050
it does not make your paint better.
It does.

3832
02:36:44,080 --> 02:36:47,050
It makes you more sensitive.
Trust me is the reason why basketball

3833
02:36:47,051 --> 02:36:50,110
players find it better to.
It puts them into some sort of a zone.

3834
02:36:50,260 --> 02:36:51,970
Now are you saying that Lebron James
Needs?

3835
02:36:51,971 --> 02:36:54,670
We'd know like there's a lot of pro pool
player,

3836
02:36:54,671 --> 02:36:56,740
so we're top of the food chain and don't
do anything right,

3837
02:36:56,770 --> 02:37:01,750
but a lot of guys who like it say that
we'd bumps their game up quite a bit and

3838
02:37:01,751 --> 02:37:03,340
I'm one of them.
It makes me play better.

3839
02:37:03,910 --> 02:37:05,860
I'm telling you,
you don't know because you don't smoke.

3840
02:37:05,861 --> 02:37:08,320
Wait,
can you do an experiment?

3841
02:37:08,830 --> 02:37:10,180
I want to express.
I want you to play.

3842
02:37:10,340 --> 02:37:11,940
You're going to.
You're going to play pool.

3843
02:37:11,941 --> 02:37:12,940
You play?
No,

3844
02:37:13,100 --> 02:37:14,730
you're going to play pool sober.
Okay.

3845
02:37:14,810 --> 02:37:16,010
Okay.
And then you're gonna.

3846
02:37:16,040 --> 02:37:20,100
See your results.
And then see the problem is if weapon

3847
02:37:20,101 --> 02:37:23,480
experiments sober and then I smoke,
I smoke pot and get high.

3848
02:37:23,481 --> 02:37:26,750
I will have been warmed up for the
playing pool sober and I'll definitely

3849
02:37:26,751 --> 02:37:28,070
play better.
High separate.

3850
02:37:28,290 --> 02:37:31,910
It's separate days.
But the problem with separate days is

3851
02:37:32,720 --> 02:37:34,970
have to,
your body has to be like perfectly in

3852
02:37:34,971 --> 02:37:37,790
tune and running to get real accurate
results because one day I could have

3853
02:37:37,791 --> 02:37:39,950
lifted weights,
which fucks up your pool game.

3854
02:37:39,951 --> 02:37:41,210
Like nothing.
Here we go,

3855
02:37:41,320 --> 02:37:44,210
telling you,
just pick two of my best games.

3856
02:37:44,211 --> 02:37:48,170
I was medicated Matt Barnes on his game
day use of marijuana.

3857
02:37:48,410 --> 02:37:51,500
Matt Barnes who will not be in the hall
of fame.

3858
02:37:51,530 --> 02:37:53,690
Who did the player?
He.

3859
02:37:53,720 --> 02:37:54,690
He.
He was all right.

3860
02:37:54,691 --> 02:37:56,370
But he's a role player.
I want to.

3861
02:37:56,440 --> 02:37:58,580
I want Michael Jordan to come out and
say that.

3862
02:37:58,610 --> 02:37:59,930
Then I'm going to be like,
oh wow.

3863
02:38:00,160 --> 02:38:01,580
Know I want.
I want someone like that.

3864
02:38:02,190 --> 02:38:05,550
They'll go,
don't tell me what the role players will

3865
02:38:05,551 --> 02:38:06,700
see.
You're saying this though,

3866
02:38:06,710 --> 02:38:10,940
as a guy who doesn't smoke pot,
I'm telling you for Jujitsu,

3867
02:38:11,000 --> 02:38:14,000
for Jujitsu,
it's a huge part of the Jujitsu world.

3868
02:38:14,020 --> 02:38:18,140
Lot of people get high and then to
Jujitsu and they say it makes the game

3869
02:38:18,141 --> 02:38:20,600
better.
What's the practical use of Jujitsu?

3870
02:38:21,530 --> 02:38:24,500
Well,
if you and I were in a fight that would

3871
02:38:24,501 --> 02:38:26,850
kill you,
that I think he would kill me,

3872
02:38:27,530 --> 02:38:29,450
kill me anyway,
but telling me the practical.

3873
02:38:29,451 --> 02:38:31,190
Okay,
so just for that moment,

3874
02:38:31,191 --> 02:38:33,580
but any other.
But no,

3875
02:38:33,620 --> 02:38:35,330
no.
It's not just you want to be high.

3876
02:38:35,331 --> 02:38:39,410
If you were to walk into your car late
at night and then three guys came at you

3877
02:38:39,530 --> 02:38:41,300
and you would,
would you want it to be asking what's

3878
02:38:41,301 --> 02:38:44,000
the perfect circumstance?
Then you're late at night.

3879
02:38:44,000 --> 02:38:46,670
You're headed to your car.
I don't think you understand marijuana.

3880
02:38:47,270 --> 02:38:49,620
I'm just saying.
Would you want to bother them?

3881
02:38:49,690 --> 02:38:53,360
Would you prefer to be sober or high?
Neither one be fine with either one.

3882
02:38:53,480 --> 02:38:54,231
Yeah.
Oh good.

3883
02:38:54,231 --> 02:38:55,370
Good.
Then depends.

3884
02:38:55,460 --> 02:38:58,850
I mean I'm not going to be able to do
anything different if I'm sober or.

3885
02:38:58,851 --> 02:39:00,150
Hi,
I'm fit,

3886
02:39:00,170 --> 02:39:02,930
but we're not talking about drunk now.
If you said what?

3887
02:39:02,931 --> 02:39:05,060
I want to be drunk or sober,
fuck you.

3888
02:39:05,061 --> 02:39:06,390
I'd want to be sober.
Oh no I'm not.

3889
02:39:06,530 --> 02:39:07,610
I didn't.
I get it.

3890
02:39:07,670 --> 02:39:12,670
If I'm worried about getting kit and I'm
not sure about reaction time or one of

3891
02:39:12,681 --> 02:39:15,530
the things about pod is it makes you a
little bit paranoid so it puts you on

3892
02:39:15,531 --> 02:39:17,360
edge.
It makes you aware of Shit.

3893
02:39:17,870 --> 02:39:21,710
The other thing is it focuses you like
very cleanly on what you're doing.

3894
02:39:21,910 --> 02:39:24,650
Like if you're do this out here,
just really strong there.

3895
02:39:24,690 --> 02:39:28,430
I didn't know I like it,
but if you're a drawing or music or

3896
02:39:28,431 --> 02:39:31,580
something along those lines.
We really try to focus a lot of writing.

3897
02:39:31,610 --> 02:39:35,240
A lot of people really like it for those
things because it makes you really focus

3898
02:39:35,241 --> 02:39:36,950
on what you're doing,
but then.

3899
02:39:37,210 --> 02:39:41,540
But then I think what happens then is
that that whatever they were doing on

3900
02:39:41,541 --> 02:39:43,160
that,
they don't apply it to.

3901
02:39:43,490 --> 02:39:45,500
Because I know a lot.
We all have a lot.

3902
02:39:45,501 --> 02:39:47,720
We both have a lot of potheads comedian
friends.

3903
02:39:48,290 --> 02:39:49,400
Yeah,
but there's some of them.

3904
02:39:49,401 --> 02:39:52,610
I know that when I started with them,
I know that they're not doing what

3905
02:39:52,611 --> 02:39:56,150
they're doing now that they're in,
that they didn't keep going.

3906
02:39:56,200 --> 02:39:59,840
It exceed their expectations and I know
proud of it was because of the pot.

3907
02:39:59,900 --> 02:40:02,480
I don't think it is.
I think the pod is just common

3908
02:40:02,481 --> 02:40:03,920
denominator uses an excuse.

3909
02:40:03,920 --> 02:40:06,680
It's not.
The common denominator is no work ethic.

3910
02:40:07,430 --> 02:40:08,870
That denominator is.
It did.

3911
02:40:08,871 --> 02:40:12,020
It didn't help to work ethic.
I don't think it hurts or helps.

3912
02:40:12,230 --> 02:40:15,060
I think it's just.
It's a factor of study on this.

3913
02:40:15,240 --> 02:40:18,060
Yeah.
I mean the study would be skewed because

3914
02:40:18,061 --> 02:40:21,660
a lot of failures that get high all the
time would be in the study,

3915
02:40:21,990 --> 02:40:25,850
but a lot of winners that get high on
the time don't want to talk about it and

3916
02:40:25,860 --> 02:40:27,420
I was,
by the way,

3917
02:40:27,421 --> 02:40:29,220
I'm with you 100 percent on this.
I.

3918
02:40:29,221 --> 02:40:32,310
What I hate is that the people that
don't have any work ethic,

3919
02:40:32,640 --> 02:40:37,200
they look at somebody with a work ethic
that smokes weed and then say,

3920
02:40:37,380 --> 02:40:39,870
well look,
they made it because they smoke weed.

3921
02:40:39,930 --> 02:40:40,763
And I'm like,
no.

3922
02:40:40,770 --> 02:40:42,480
They would have made it without the
weed.

3923
02:40:42,481 --> 02:40:43,890
Yeah.
They would have made it without the way.

3924
02:40:43,920 --> 02:40:46,470
That's what I'm saying.
Before I ever smoked weed.

3925
02:40:46,471 --> 02:40:51,440
I was already on television.
He had a warner brothers cd as no start

3926
02:40:51,450 --> 02:40:54,210
smoking weed until like 2000.
I'm not.

3927
02:40:54,211 --> 02:40:55,860
I'm not listening.
I'm not anti weed,

3928
02:40:56,160 --> 02:40:58,890
but I just think that with anything
there should be moderation.

3929
02:40:58,920 --> 02:40:59,671
Yes.
No,

3930
02:40:59,671 --> 02:41:02,010
I agree.
Like one of the best things I did last

3931
02:41:02,010 --> 02:41:04,800
year was Ari and Tom Segura and Bert
Kreischer nine.

3932
02:41:04,801 --> 02:41:08,200
We did this sober October thing where I
saw.

3933
02:41:08,310 --> 02:41:10,590
I saw no booze,
no pot,

3934
02:41:10,591 --> 02:41:15,360
and we had to do 15 hot yoga classes in
the month and I learned a lot in that

3935
02:41:15,360 --> 02:41:16,193
month.
I really did.

3936
02:41:16,230 --> 02:41:18,060
Are you different?
Are you different person because of it?

3937
02:41:18,180 --> 02:41:19,140
No,
it was good.

3938
02:41:19,141 --> 02:41:21,260
You got to get out of here.
Yeah.

3939
02:41:21,460 --> 02:41:24,070
Not really.
Jesus.

3940
02:41:24,180 --> 02:41:25,540
Thirty to 20 bro.
Yeah,

3941
02:41:25,560 --> 02:41:27,130
I'm doing another one.
I'm going going,

3942
02:41:27,600 --> 02:41:29,640
going to see Barry Katz,
you if you can believe that.

3943
02:41:29,641 --> 02:41:30,474
Congratulations.

3944
02:41:32,850 --> 02:41:35,670
Barry Katz is a podcast.
That's going to be an interesting day

3945
02:41:35,671 --> 02:41:38,130
for me.
Was we just.

3946
02:41:38,260 --> 02:41:39,390
Oh,
about the pot,

3947
02:41:39,550 --> 02:41:42,600
but I forget what was going to say stone
and thought.

3948
02:41:42,810 --> 02:41:43,643
No,
it's not.

3949
02:41:44,390 --> 02:41:48,180
It's not whether or not you smoke pot.
It's whether or not you get things done

3950
02:41:48,450 --> 02:41:50,640
and whether or not you write out what
you're supposed to do,

3951
02:41:50,641 --> 02:41:53,280
whether or not you actually try to
achieve goals,

3952
02:41:53,281 --> 02:41:56,760
whether or not you're.
You're actively trying to improve

3953
02:41:57,000 --> 02:42:01,080
whatever you're doing,
whether you build cars or make carpet,

3954
02:42:01,110 --> 02:42:04,170
cabinetry.
It's just about whether or not you're

3955
02:42:04,260 --> 02:42:07,470
working towards succeeding and and
improving.

3956
02:42:07,500 --> 02:42:08,610
And I agree.
Listen,

3957
02:42:08,611 --> 02:42:10,100
I agree with it.
I'm not anti pot.

3958
02:42:10,340 --> 02:42:13,560
I'm not.
I shouldn't agree with based on evidence

3959
02:42:13,830 --> 02:42:15,750
of the people that are around a lot of
us.

3960
02:42:15,751 --> 02:42:18,390
We should be anti.
I should be antipop dude.

3961
02:42:18,391 --> 02:42:22,440
I know a lot of people that were there
were made me sad like I'd run into him

3962
02:42:22,441 --> 02:42:23,790
at the comedy store and they'd be like,
Bro,

3963
02:42:23,791 --> 02:42:24,780
you got any weed on you,
man.

3964
02:42:24,780 --> 02:42:25,500
You.
Yeah,

3965
02:42:25,500 --> 02:42:27,090
and I'd be like,
you're not doing anything.

3966
02:42:27,120 --> 02:42:29,280
You're not doing anything with your life
and you want some weed.

3967
02:42:29,310 --> 02:42:31,410
Go get a job.
Get some wheat.

3968
02:42:31,450 --> 02:42:33,870
Yeah.
But then you also see guys like Ari who

3969
02:42:33,871 --> 02:42:35,730
get high all the time and they're
constantly working.

3970
02:42:35,740 --> 02:42:39,390
Or Doug Benson,
who's like the most functional pothead

3971
02:42:39,780 --> 02:42:42,060
I've ever met in my lifestyle.
All Day he's a weird one,

3972
02:42:42,061 --> 02:42:45,420
or snoop dogg there people,
but these are people that are.

3973
02:42:45,440 --> 02:42:47,190
They are the exceptions,
not the rule.

3974
02:42:47,550 --> 02:42:49,570
I wonder.
There's a lot of people on Wall Street

3975
02:42:49,571 --> 02:42:51,090
that get high.
There's a lot of people that are

3976
02:42:51,091 --> 02:42:56,091
involved in like the tech world that get
high a lot and what people think about

3977
02:42:56,281 --> 02:42:58,200
it is that,
look,

3978
02:42:58,201 --> 02:42:59,490
it's like everything else,
man.

3979
02:42:59,491 --> 02:43:02,280
It can be good for you or it could fuck
your world up.

3980
02:43:03,020 --> 02:43:05,610
My ratio.
I think there's some benefit to it and

3981
02:43:05,611 --> 02:43:07,980
what the benefit is,
vulnerability,

3982
02:43:08,010 --> 02:43:08,843
creativity.

3983
02:43:08,960 --> 02:43:10,980
It makes you feel vulnerable.
It makes you.

3984
02:43:11,770 --> 02:43:14,020
Things makes you look at me.
People call it paranoia.

3985
02:43:14,200 --> 02:43:16,900
I just think it broadens your,
your awareness.

3986
02:43:16,940 --> 02:43:20,890
I think as a standup you already have a
level of vulnerability just going on

3987
02:43:20,891 --> 02:43:22,510
stage and talking about things.
For sure.

3988
02:43:22,511 --> 02:43:24,430
So that's like my.
I'm sure that some of that.

3989
02:43:24,640 --> 02:43:26,170
I just,
I just feel like that's my drug.

3990
02:43:26,440 --> 02:43:28,120
Does a good drug.
I mean it's,

3991
02:43:28,160 --> 02:43:30,190
it's definitely not one.
It's gonna ruin your life.

3992
02:43:30,220 --> 02:43:31,260
Hopefully.
Yeah.

3993
02:43:31,330 --> 02:43:34,300
Unless you tell a bad planet of the apes
jokes on twitter,

3994
02:43:37,870 --> 02:43:38,703
on that area,
and

3995
02:43:42,600 --> 02:43:43,890
she got that old school.
Yeah,

3996
02:43:44,570 --> 02:43:47,140
she got that abm from the motherland.

3997
02:43:49,300 --> 02:43:51,730
I hope she bounces back,
but I don't know if she will.

3998
02:43:52,140 --> 02:43:56,350
Has Anybody bounced back from this new
era of fucking hate and anger?

3999
02:43:56,500 --> 02:44:00,820
No one has bounced back.
I don't think like Aziz wasn't taken out

4000
02:44:01,510 --> 02:44:03,600
well the show was canceled or anything
like that.

4001
02:44:03,610 --> 02:44:07,330
Have a show except the Netflix show and
he didn't do anything to the point where

4002
02:44:07,331 --> 02:44:09,790
it was like a crime,
but a lot of people went after him like

4003
02:44:09,791 --> 02:44:10,270
that.
Sam,

4004
02:44:10,270 --> 02:44:14,200
Samantha Bee lady went after him and Oh,
she's going hard to everybody.

4005
02:44:14,201 --> 02:44:16,940
Yeah.
She's going hard and everybody was

4006
02:44:17,040 --> 02:44:17,590
saying,
yeah,

4007
02:44:17,590 --> 02:44:19,920
it becomes a stick at a certain point.
No,

4008
02:44:19,980 --> 02:44:23,050
it loses credibility.
Sort of just.

4009
02:44:23,260 --> 02:44:26,110
She means it means well.
It's an important voice.

4010
02:44:26,140 --> 02:44:30,130
The problem with going hard on a person
is you're only getting one version of

4011
02:44:30,160 --> 02:44:31,400
what happened.
You know,

4012
02:44:31,410 --> 02:44:34,300
like we're not talking about going hard
on a person who committed a crime.

4013
02:44:34,300 --> 02:44:37,290
You're going hard on a person that's
involved in an interaction with two

4014
02:44:37,300 --> 02:44:39,410
people.
What I would like to see though is like

4015
02:44:39,730 --> 02:44:43,600
someone like Samantha Bee to like ask
Aziz to come on her show.

4016
02:44:43,690 --> 02:44:45,400
Oh,
you wouldn't do that and had him do it.

4017
02:44:45,460 --> 02:44:47,440
No,
but that's what I'm seeing is that we're

4018
02:44:47,470 --> 02:44:49,810
missing.
That would be you wouldn't use already

4019
02:44:49,811 --> 02:44:51,340
attacked.
It's solid in entertainment.

4020
02:44:51,430 --> 02:44:53,260
I mean it's like,
isn't that the whole point of it

4021
02:44:53,650 --> 02:44:55,510
probably hurts for him.
Well,

4022
02:44:55,690 --> 02:44:58,900
as he can,
he can handle himself in that forum.

4023
02:44:59,260 --> 02:45:02,500
I would like to see that.
I see even that.

4024
02:45:02,501 --> 02:45:05,100
I think those forums are hard to do.
You know,

4025
02:45:05,110 --> 02:45:10,110
I did a bench Pieros podcast that just
aired yesterday and he is a Sunday

4026
02:45:10,781 --> 02:45:14,920
special thing that he does and is an
hour long and every 15 minutes he

4027
02:45:14,921 --> 02:45:17,560
stopped the conversation,
does a commercial and while I was

4028
02:45:17,561 --> 02:45:18,520
sitting there doing it,
I was like,

4029
02:45:18,521 --> 02:45:19,450
I really liked guy.

4030
02:45:19,510 --> 02:45:22,240
I really like talking to him.
Brilliant Guy,

4031
02:45:22,540 --> 02:45:26,800
but this is not the best way to stay
loose and have a conversation like this

4032
02:45:26,940 --> 02:45:28,240
pod catcher.
I get you.

4033
02:45:28,300 --> 02:45:32,320
This is the best format that says it is
the kind of conversations that we've had

4034
02:45:32,321 --> 02:45:35,620
over the past three hours.
This is the best format because you just

4035
02:45:35,621 --> 02:45:38,140
talk nothing.
Nothing interrupts you.

4036
02:45:38,141 --> 02:45:39,240
There's no sensors.
There's,

4037
02:45:39,241 --> 02:45:40,510
yeah,
there's no thing that you have ahead of

4038
02:45:40,511 --> 02:45:41,890
time.
Please don't talk about this.

4039
02:45:42,310 --> 02:45:45,700
And also like it's best with friends.
Like,

4040
02:45:45,701 --> 02:45:47,310
you know,
I care about you,

4041
02:45:47,311 --> 02:45:48,340
you know,
your friend,

4042
02:45:48,640 --> 02:45:50,560
you know,
we're going to have fun and there's no.

4043
02:45:50,561 --> 02:45:53,050
I'm not looking to get you to be weird
with you.

4044
02:45:53,140 --> 02:45:53,830
Gotcha.
Gotcha.

4045
02:45:53,830 --> 02:45:55,450
Podcast.
Trying to have fun with you.

4046
02:45:55,451 --> 02:45:56,680
And we had fun.
You know,

4047
02:45:56,681 --> 02:45:59,410
and this,
this is like the best format to get to

4048
02:45:59,411 --> 02:46:03,370
understand people.
I think what we're missing today in this

4049
02:46:03,371 --> 02:46:05,880
world,
in this is this is just

4050
02:46:07,600 --> 02:46:10,220
an open thought.
People need

4051
02:46:10,220 --> 02:46:15,220
more opportunities to be cool with each
other and less it take advantage of less

4052
02:46:15,411 --> 02:46:19,640
opportunities to attack each other.
And I see a lot of attacking lately and

4053
02:46:19,641 --> 02:46:22,220
I don't know if the,
the attacking is because there have been

4054
02:46:22,221 --> 02:46:25,580
so many egregious crimes that need to be
corrected.

4055
02:46:25,581 --> 02:46:27,840
Like Harvey Weinstein or like,
you know,

4056
02:46:27,860 --> 02:46:30,110
fill in the blank,
but all the other monsters that have

4057
02:46:30,111 --> 02:46:31,850
been out there,
it's late.

4058
02:46:32,030 --> 02:46:32,920
I'm not picking on people.
Cute.

4059
02:46:33,000 --> 02:46:35,080
I'm going to keep texting you.
Yeah.

4060
02:46:35,220 --> 02:46:38,120
Your phones on your watch that isn't
that weird.

4061
02:46:38,121 --> 02:46:41,280
It's different all the time.
So he's changing that x.

4062
02:46:41,450 --> 02:46:43,820
What happens when you hit that?
You hit the x and then it just goes to

4063
02:46:43,821 --> 02:46:46,380
whatever else.
I think somebody is listening to our

4064
02:46:46,400 --> 02:46:47,650
podcasts right now.
So.

4065
02:46:47,820 --> 02:46:49,970
And somebody texted my girlfriend and
she's like,

4066
02:46:50,060 --> 02:46:51,440
actually just sent me a text message
right now.

4067
02:46:51,440 --> 02:46:55,550
You better not be married.
I don't know what that means,

4068
02:46:57,040 --> 02:47:01,670
but
I'm hoping that it all balances out.

4069
02:47:01,790 --> 02:47:05,030
I hope that it comes back around and
people just think,

4070
02:47:05,360 --> 02:47:08,000
well,
human being just be nice to each other

4071
02:47:08,120 --> 02:47:12,050
just by example is all it is.
It's a hard thing.

4072
02:47:12,051 --> 02:47:14,900
We have to lead by example.
That's why I'm saying these issues that

4073
02:47:14,901 --> 02:47:17,930
men as a man,
what we're having out here is we forgot

4074
02:47:17,940 --> 02:47:20,280
how to be gentlemen.
We've done.

4075
02:47:20,310 --> 02:47:22,640
And I think that if like say the disease
situation,

4076
02:47:22,641 --> 02:47:25,010
if he had just been a gentleman,
I don't know what he did.

4077
02:47:25,070 --> 02:47:28,100
I don't know if you've read that.
And obviously what I read the story,

4078
02:47:28,101 --> 02:47:29,960
it was just,
he was trying to get with her,

4079
02:47:30,180 --> 02:47:31,880
you know,
they were texting back and forth and it

4080
02:47:31,881 --> 02:47:32,410
was like,
Yo,

4081
02:47:32,410 --> 02:47:35,060
y'all already went to dinner and they
ended up at his place and it was,

4082
02:47:35,061 --> 02:47:37,100
you know,
it was like maybe you don't bring a

4083
02:47:37,101 --> 02:47:38,630
check that you barely know to your
place.

4084
02:47:38,630 --> 02:47:40,980
Now maybe there's two different types of
short.

4085
02:47:41,010 --> 02:47:42,620
Right?
If you're too.

4086
02:47:42,860 --> 02:47:44,040
But if you're a guy like that,
I mean,

4087
02:47:44,120 --> 02:47:45,710
you know,
if you heard Tony talk about it,

4088
02:47:45,711 --> 02:47:47,570
women are throwing themselves at you all
the time.

4089
02:47:47,571 --> 02:47:50,640
What are you supposed to do?
Act like a gentleman is what I'm saying.

4090
02:47:51,370 --> 02:47:52,570
Get up,
get up,

4091
02:47:53,130 --> 02:47:55,300
excuse the excuse.
Shouldn't be as like,

4092
02:47:55,400 --> 02:47:57,890
you know,
like that's like a man way to say it to.

4093
02:47:57,891 --> 02:47:58,760
It'd be like,
you know,

4094
02:47:58,761 --> 02:48:01,580
you've got all these hot chicks.
One of us will say no to these hot

4095
02:48:01,581 --> 02:48:03,020
chicks.
Yeah,

4096
02:48:03,080 --> 02:48:03,913
maybe you should.
Wow.

4097
02:48:03,920 --> 02:48:08,450
Look at you all judgmental.
Here's a guy who had the girl come back

4098
02:48:08,451 --> 02:48:09,380
to his place.
She was,

4099
02:48:09,410 --> 02:48:11,780
she would say no to her.
I should have.

4100
02:48:11,860 --> 02:48:13,700
That's my shit.
I should have.

4101
02:48:13,760 --> 02:48:16,700
I should have stopped it,
but I let my ego get in the way.

4102
02:48:16,700 --> 02:48:17,520
I let my own,
like,

4103
02:48:17,520 --> 02:48:18,351
you know,
insecurity.

4104
02:48:18,351 --> 02:48:19,320
It'd be like,
well this got really.

4105
02:48:19,321 --> 02:48:20,151
You didn't let me.
So let me,

4106
02:48:20,151 --> 02:48:21,880
let me go through.
Hey,

4107
02:48:22,040 --> 02:48:24,740
just because you can doesn't mean you
should.

4108
02:48:24,830 --> 02:48:26,480
Let's end ended with that.
I think we should.

4109

4115
02:48:41,781 --> 02:48:43,660
