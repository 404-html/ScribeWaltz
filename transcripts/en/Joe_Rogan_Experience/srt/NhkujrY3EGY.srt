00:00:01,050 --> 00:00:02,910
Hello Freak bitches.

2
00:00:03,260 --> 00:00:06,330
I mean everybody has their moments of
getting hot and then cold and you know,

3
00:00:06,331 --> 00:00:08,010
you've have to hope if you get cold,

4
00:00:08,011 --> 00:00:08,491
your head hot,

5
00:00:08,491 --> 00:00:09,150
you know,

6
00:00:09,150 --> 00:00:09,983
it's.

7
00:00:10,410 --> 00:00:10,711
Yeah,

8
00:00:10,711 --> 00:00:11,544
but

9
00:00:13,460 --> 00:00:14,700
it's really fucking stupid.

10
00:00:14,701 --> 00:00:15,230
I don't know,

11
00:00:15,230 --> 00:00:17,790
like during that whole Chris Brown thing,

12
00:00:17,791 --> 00:00:19,720
that's my only example.

13
00:00:19,880 --> 00:00:24,570
So of course I was getting invited to
be on shows and talk about it and I

14
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:25,620
declined to everything.

15
00:00:25,621 --> 00:00:25,921
It was like,

16
00:00:25,921 --> 00:00:26,610
no,

17
00:00:26,610 --> 00:00:27,840
I'm not good for you.

18
00:00:27,870 --> 00:00:28,141
I was like,

19
00:00:28,141 --> 00:00:28,831
absolutely not.

20
00:00:28,831 --> 00:00:29,910
I wasn't the Chris Brown things.

21
00:00:29,950 --> 00:00:31,380
We talked about it before the podcast,

22
00:00:31,381 --> 00:00:36,300
but if people don't know Chris Brown
obviously was in trouble because was beat

23
00:00:36,301 --> 00:00:41,301
up or Yana and that whole thing and you
know the domestic violence issue and you

24
00:00:42,090 --> 00:00:43,530
tweeted something at him.

25
00:00:43,531 --> 00:00:44,364
What did you tweet?

26
00:00:44,540 --> 00:00:49,540
It was like my lowest form of comedy
writing is the celebrity reach weight.

27
00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:53,610
It's because I can't think of anything
else and I'll just go to my favorite

28
00:00:53,611 --> 00:00:57,540
targets like Hammer Kim Kardashians
and I only make fun of when they write

29
00:00:57,541 --> 00:00:58,290
something stupid.

30
00:00:58,290 --> 00:00:58,861
I never,

31
00:00:58,861 --> 00:01:02,520
I never ever like I've never talked
about some of these looks their weight.

32
00:01:02,570 --> 00:01:03,460
There you know,

33
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:06,750
like it's just when
something dumb and with his,

34
00:01:06,830 --> 00:01:07,200
you know,

35
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:07,621
what he did,

36
00:01:07,621 --> 00:01:10,860
he's a horrible person and he
had showed no signs of remorse.

37
00:01:10,861 --> 00:01:12,240
Like he kept doing shit,

38
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:13,050
you know,

39
00:01:13,050 --> 00:01:16,090
threw a chair through the window and
good morning America when Robin Roberts

40
00:01:16,230 --> 00:01:17,063
interviewed him.

41
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:17,431
Yeah.

42
00:01:17,431 --> 00:01:20,910
Well I mean like asking him about it and
apparently they had made some sort of

43
00:01:20,911 --> 00:01:23,430
an agreement where they weren't
going to bring up domestic violence.

44
00:01:23,570 --> 00:01:24,660
I'm here to talk about my album,

45
00:01:25,620 --> 00:01:26,371
but the whole thing is,

46
00:01:26,371 --> 00:01:28,260
it's like how he channeled his rage,

47
00:01:28,490 --> 00:01:30,440
throwing a chair through
a fucking window really,

48
00:01:30,470 --> 00:01:31,320
like you couldn't.

49
00:01:31,830 --> 00:01:36,720
So I was born child and so I was born
and he had tweeted something like,

50
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:37,673
um,

51
00:01:37,710 --> 00:01:38,071
man,

52
00:01:38,071 --> 00:01:40,170
I look old as fuck and I'm only 23.

53
00:01:40,690 --> 00:01:42,060
And so I retweeted it and I was like,

54
00:01:42,061 --> 00:01:44,670
I know being a worthless piece
of shit can really aged person.

55
00:01:46,050 --> 00:01:50,670
I thought it was funny and then all of
a sudden like I look at my replies on my

56
00:01:50,671 --> 00:01:51,570
phone and it was like,

57
00:01:52,260 --> 00:01:53,190
you don't look like that.

58
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:56,010
The waterfall of just like,

59
00:01:56,011 --> 00:01:57,720
all of a sudden it was
like a thousand $2,000.

60
00:01:57,750 --> 00:01:58,080
I'm like,

61
00:01:58,080 --> 00:01:58,913
Holy Shit,

62
00:01:59,430 --> 00:02:00,180
whoops.

63
00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:01,080
What did I do?

64
00:02:01,081 --> 00:02:06,081
And then I realized he was coming
back like telling me to suck his dick.

65
00:02:06,091 --> 00:02:06,421
I'm like,

66
00:02:06,421 --> 00:02:06,750
no,

67
00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:07,471
your mother must be.

68
00:02:07,471 --> 00:02:08,190
So like I just,

69
00:02:08,190 --> 00:02:09,050
I played with them.

70
00:02:09,470 --> 00:02:10,111
It was a Sunday.

71
00:02:10,111 --> 00:02:13,890
I was bored and like next thing I know
is like he deleted his entire twitter

72
00:02:13,891 --> 00:02:17,370
account and I feel like wow,

73
00:02:17,550 --> 00:02:18,600
that's not what I meant to do.

74
00:02:18,940 --> 00:02:23,020
Did he say one of the shit in
your mouth too short in my eye.

75
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:25,830
Your eye retina to be

76
00:02:27,710 --> 00:02:28,440
specific.

77
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:28,981
I don't know.

78
00:02:28,981 --> 00:02:30,960
I think he was trying to
sound smart beam accuracy.

79
00:02:30,961 --> 00:02:33,210
Does he have with the is
even the back of the eye?

80
00:02:33,211 --> 00:02:33,561
It's on,

81
00:02:33,561 --> 00:02:33,931
in the front,

82
00:02:33,931 --> 00:02:34,764
like he didn't even.

83
00:02:35,090 --> 00:02:40,090
I think it's just trying to sound
smart and on your retina laughing away.

84
00:02:40,771 --> 00:02:44,490
And I like he said like
ask Ron if she mad.

85
00:02:44,491 --> 00:02:46,890
I'm like ask Anna if she man.

86
00:02:47,970 --> 00:02:52,970
So like I tweeted back and then I linked
his police report to that tweet is a.

87
00:02:53,540 --> 00:02:57,960
I thought it was funny and we went back
and forth for awhile and then he deleted

88
00:02:57,961 --> 00:03:00,340
his account and that's when it a a thing.

89
00:03:00,370 --> 00:03:01,270
Did he put it back up?

90
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:02,500
Is this back?

91
00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:03,070
Yeah,

92
00:03:03,070 --> 00:03:05,290
it wasn't really like down for like a
couple of weeks or something like that.

93
00:03:05,291 --> 00:03:07,570
Can you delete your account when you put
it back to you get all your followers

94
00:03:07,571 --> 00:03:07,840
back?

95
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:08,740
Do you have to start from scratch?

96
00:03:09,110 --> 00:03:09,943
Start from scratch.

97
00:03:10,540 --> 00:03:10,871
But I,

98
00:03:10,871 --> 00:03:15,871
he has the most insane loyal
group of idiots that follow him.

99
00:03:17,230 --> 00:03:21,940
Just misspelled death threats all day
long is what I got was just misspelled

100
00:03:21,941 --> 00:03:22,774
death threats.

101
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:24,050
I was like,

102
00:03:24,050 --> 00:03:24,883
well,

103
00:03:25,150 --> 00:03:25,451
you know,

104
00:03:25,451 --> 00:03:25,870
whoops.

105
00:03:25,870 --> 00:03:26,760
But then the next day I was like,

106
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:29,470
my manager,

107
00:03:29,471 --> 00:03:30,730
like I love the call that I got.

108
00:03:30,731 --> 00:03:31,061
She's like,

109
00:03:31,061 --> 00:03:31,590
Jenny,

110
00:03:31,590 --> 00:03:32,080
um,

111
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:32,913
what did you do?

112
00:03:33,390 --> 00:03:35,410
Have a lot of messages here.

113
00:03:35,411 --> 00:03:35,891
And I was like,

114
00:03:35,891 --> 00:03:36,430
yeah,

115
00:03:36,430 --> 00:03:36,940
no,

116
00:03:36,940 --> 00:03:37,773
my bad.

117
00:03:38,450 --> 00:03:39,210
Like,

118
00:03:39,210 --> 00:03:39,841
just tell them all.

119
00:03:39,841 --> 00:03:40,674
No.

120
00:03:40,750 --> 00:03:41,590
And she's like,

121
00:03:41,591 --> 00:03:41,951
okay.

122
00:03:41,951 --> 00:03:42,341
And she goes,

123
00:03:42,341 --> 00:03:43,180
are you sure you don't want.

124
00:03:43,410 --> 00:03:45,520
I've got good ones to view Larry King.

125
00:03:45,690 --> 00:03:45,960
I was like,

126
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:46,250
no,

127
00:03:46,250 --> 00:03:47,290
view is a good one.

128
00:03:47,291 --> 00:03:48,124
How hilarious.

129
00:03:48,150 --> 00:03:48,983
She's like,

130
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,650
she was totally not promoting this,

131
00:03:50,651 --> 00:03:51,484
and she's like,

132
00:03:51,660 --> 00:03:52,411
you got some good ones.

133
00:03:52,411 --> 00:03:53,031
I want you to be on.

134
00:03:53,031 --> 00:03:53,801
We got Larry King,

135
00:03:53,801 --> 00:03:54,401
we get the view,

136
00:03:54,401 --> 00:03:54,731
and I was like,

137
00:03:54,731 --> 00:03:55,061
no,

138
00:03:55,061 --> 00:03:55,450
no,

139
00:03:55,450 --> 00:03:56,283
no.

140
00:03:56,310 --> 00:03:57,240
That's one way to do it,

141
00:03:57,990 --> 00:03:59,790
and I've definitely done that way before.

142
00:03:59,791 --> 00:04:00,624
I've done it.

143
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:01,411
A bunch of shitty.

144
00:04:01,411 --> 00:04:03,150
What's the worst way you've ever done it?

145
00:04:03,970 --> 00:04:05,850
I've just got the chicken nuggets way,

146
00:04:05,851 --> 00:04:08,640
but right around that same time,

147
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:10,710
not,

148
00:04:10,710 --> 00:04:11,490
not eating.

149
00:04:11,490 --> 00:04:12,001
I remember,

150
00:04:12,001 --> 00:04:14,850
so my first kickboxing fight ever.

151
00:04:14,851 --> 00:04:16,200
I fought a guy named Andy Sour.

152
00:04:16,201 --> 00:04:17,710
I don't know if you're
sure familiar with it.

153
00:04:17,730 --> 00:04:18,540
That was your first kick?

154
00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:20,890
My first kickboxing fight over fucking.

155
00:04:20,900 --> 00:04:22,650
Is that your manager?

156
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,590
How long has andy been fighting then?

157
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:28,380
He is already his record at the time.

158
00:04:28,381 --> 00:04:31,320
I remember two and for some 93 in one.

159
00:04:31,650 --> 00:04:32,910
Oh my God,

160
00:04:32,911 --> 00:04:34,130
that's so insane.

161
00:04:34,131 --> 00:04:36,930
It through one and I was
first kickboxing fat.

162
00:04:36,990 --> 00:04:38,170
All my ga,

163
00:04:38,190 --> 00:04:39,960
I was 12 and O as an mma.

164
00:04:40,020 --> 00:04:40,920
As an MMA fighter.

165
00:04:40,921 --> 00:04:41,980
Oh my God.

166
00:04:41,981 --> 00:04:43,200
I was 19 years old.

167
00:04:44,340 --> 00:04:49,170
I had maybe one or two amateur boxing
fights and I had been training him or I'd

168
00:04:49,171 --> 00:04:50,500
been trying to kickboxing for lots on,

169
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:51,180
but anyway,

170
00:04:51,180 --> 00:04:52,800
I go up to 91,

171
00:04:53,010 --> 00:04:53,361
92,

172
00:04:53,361 --> 00:04:54,120
93 and one.

173
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:54,500
I remember.

174
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:55,333
Oh Man.

175
00:04:55,770 --> 00:04:59,010
What fucking governing
body sanctioned that?

176
00:04:59,070 --> 00:04:59,340
Uh,

177
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:00,173
it was in Japan.

178
00:05:00,420 --> 00:05:00,800
Uh,

179
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:01,420
I was basically,

180
00:05:01,420 --> 00:05:01,870
I was,

181
00:05:01,870 --> 00:05:03,960
I was the guy in Japan.

182
00:05:03,961 --> 00:05:04,560
Exactly.

183
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:06,510
I was the guy that they were
bringing in for the slaughter.

184
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:07,940
Oh my God.

185
00:05:07,980 --> 00:05:08,710
Uh,

186
00:05:08,710 --> 00:05:11,100
I show up out there and I'm only,

187
00:05:11,101 --> 00:05:15,120
I think I remember I was only like eight
pounds out and we didn't know what the

188
00:05:15,121 --> 00:05:17,730
fuck we were doing with regards
to the weight cut at the time.

189
00:05:17,731 --> 00:05:18,564
I was 19.

190
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:19,351
And so I'm like,

191
00:05:19,351 --> 00:05:19,950
Oh shit.

192
00:05:19,950 --> 00:05:21,690
And I just stopped eating.

193
00:05:22,230 --> 00:05:24,780
I just didn't eat for about four days.

194
00:05:24,810 --> 00:05:25,920
Oh No.

195
00:05:26,820 --> 00:05:27,840
Oh No.

196
00:05:27,841 --> 00:05:28,081
That's.

197
00:05:28,081 --> 00:05:28,830
So meanwhile,

198
00:05:28,830 --> 00:05:30,030
eight pounds ain't shit.

199
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:31,513
I'll do that.

200
00:05:31,770 --> 00:05:32,281
I'll do that.

201
00:05:32,281 --> 00:05:32,730
Yeah.

202
00:05:32,730 --> 00:05:34,090
The day before a crowd.

203
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:34,741
Oh,

204
00:05:34,741 --> 00:05:35,311
we're good.

205
00:05:35,311 --> 00:05:35,640
Yep,

206
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:36,331
exactly.

207
00:05:36,331 --> 00:05:39,030
Still still eating one of the sauna.

208
00:05:39,090 --> 00:05:39,550
Yeah.

209
00:05:39,550 --> 00:05:40,383
Yeah.

210
00:05:40,390 --> 00:05:40,880
God.

211
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:45,120
And so I started myself for about four
days and we check in your weight by

212
00:05:45,130 --> 00:05:45,963
starving yourself.

213
00:05:46,110 --> 00:05:46,590
Yeah,

214
00:05:46,590 --> 00:05:47,281
I think it was,

215
00:05:47,281 --> 00:05:47,580
I don't,

216
00:05:47,580 --> 00:05:48,091
I don't remember.

217
00:05:48,091 --> 00:05:48,924
It's a long time ago,

218
00:05:49,260 --> 00:05:51,810
but it was same day weigh ins to.

219
00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:52,830
Oh Christ.

220
00:05:52,831 --> 00:05:57,831
I waited in the morning and then fall
about maybe eight or nine hours later.

221
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:00,740
Oh my God.

222
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:01,770
And uh,

223
00:06:02,110 --> 00:06:03,110
I went five rounds with him.

224
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:03,860
Uh,

225
00:06:03,860 --> 00:06:04,320
I went,

226
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:04,661
I,

227
00:06:04,661 --> 00:06:04,880
I,

228
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:05,020
it,

229
00:06:05,020 --> 00:06:05,390
it,

230
00:06:05,390 --> 00:06:05,761
I got,

231
00:06:05,761 --> 00:06:06,680
I got my ass kicked,

232
00:06:06,890 --> 00:06:07,723
I got my ass kicked.

233
00:06:07,730 --> 00:06:08,081
But I,

234
00:06:08,081 --> 00:06:10,190
I learned a lot and I
grew from the experience.

235
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:13,270
The big

236
00:06:13,270 --> 00:06:13,511
one,

237
00:06:13,511 --> 00:06:13,781
you know,

238
00:06:13,781 --> 00:06:15,790
that the film addresses is the,

239
00:06:15,810 --> 00:06:16,020
is,

240
00:06:16,020 --> 00:06:17,110
is the livestock,

241
00:06:17,111 --> 00:06:17,301
you know,

242
00:06:17,301 --> 00:06:20,440
that's what's got out of control and
that's what's literally destroying and

243
00:06:20,441 --> 00:06:21,640
taking over the wildlife.

244
00:06:21,641 --> 00:06:23,410
So if you really concerned about wildlife,

245
00:06:23,411 --> 00:06:24,850
if you're real wildlife person,

246
00:06:25,210 --> 00:06:28,030
the last thing you do
was not only consume,

247
00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:29,320
say factory farm,

248
00:06:29,321 --> 00:06:30,730
but that's the whole thing about our film.

249
00:06:30,731 --> 00:06:32,080
People think it's about factory farms.

250
00:06:32,110 --> 00:06:33,760
We don't even talk about factory farm.

251
00:06:34,030 --> 00:06:35,500
We talk about the grass fed beef,

252
00:06:35,501 --> 00:06:36,760
we talked about the organic,

253
00:06:37,090 --> 00:06:38,960
the organic free range,

254
00:06:39,370 --> 00:06:41,890
organic grass fed milk,

255
00:06:42,370 --> 00:06:43,900
and that's what's killing the wildlife.

256
00:06:43,901 --> 00:06:45,450
And that's the whole point of what we,

257
00:06:45,451 --> 00:06:45,691
we,

258
00:06:45,691 --> 00:06:45,911
we,

259
00:06:45,911 --> 00:06:49,600
we jumped past the factory farm
because ironically for wildlife,

260
00:06:49,601 --> 00:06:52,450
if you care truly about wildlife
and that's what they discussed.

261
00:06:52,451 --> 00:06:55,900
When we talk to any animal
agriculture alliance,

262
00:06:56,230 --> 00:06:56,681
they say,

263
00:06:56,681 --> 00:06:59,110
they say people think we're
living in somewhere 50 years ago,

264
00:06:59,111 --> 00:06:59,741
100 years ago,

265
00:06:59,741 --> 00:07:00,101
we're not,

266
00:07:00,101 --> 00:07:02,140
we're living in a place
with 7 billion people.

267
00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:05,770
The only way to efficiently fee
people who want to eat meat is to do,

268
00:07:05,771 --> 00:07:06,880
put them in factory farms,

269
00:07:06,881 --> 00:07:07,691
their factory firms,

270
00:07:07,691 --> 00:07:08,524
because they're efficient.

271
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:10,580
They only take around two acres per cow.

272
00:07:10,581 --> 00:07:12,010
Whereas is the grass fed cow.

273
00:07:12,220 --> 00:07:13,660
You're talking about
your buddy in Wisconsin,

274
00:07:13,661 --> 00:07:14,680
the guy in our film,

275
00:07:14,681 --> 00:07:16,390
he had cattle in Wisconsin.

276
00:07:16,391 --> 00:07:18,310
He said 50 acres.

277
00:07:18,370 --> 00:07:20,950
Fifty acres for one fucking cow.

278
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:21,911
One cow.

279
00:07:21,911 --> 00:07:23,050
Fifty acres,

280
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:24,071
50 acres.

281
00:07:24,071 --> 00:07:25,150
Think how big that is.

282
00:07:25,151 --> 00:07:26,770
No other wildlife can enter that.

283
00:07:27,070 --> 00:07:29,470
So that's the last thing you'd
want to eat is grass fed beef.

284
00:07:29,471 --> 00:07:31,440
The last thing you wanted to be fed is,

285
00:07:31,441 --> 00:07:32,080
um,

286
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:36,760
would beating as these organic dairy
farms that is destroying all our water,

287
00:07:36,820 --> 00:07:37,900
water resources,

288
00:07:37,901 --> 00:07:40,630
polluting the rivers and
destroying all these predators.

289
00:07:40,631 --> 00:07:41,111
And these,

290
00:07:41,111 --> 00:07:41,500
uh,

291
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:41,711
you know,

292
00:07:41,711 --> 00:07:43,060
the other wildlife that you talked about,

293
00:07:43,090 --> 00:07:47,050
but the argument would be that when you
have a grass fed cow and it's eating on

294
00:07:47,051 --> 00:07:47,831
50 acres,

295
00:07:47,831 --> 00:07:49,390
that's where it's getting its food from.

296
00:07:49,390 --> 00:07:52,960
Whereas if you have a factory raised
animals getting corn and that corn has

297
00:07:52,961 --> 00:07:55,390
raised independently on
some other large area,

298
00:07:55,450 --> 00:07:56,160
two acres,

299
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:56,993
two acres,

300
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:58,110
two acres to.

301
00:07:58,111 --> 00:07:58,270
Yeah,

302
00:07:58,270 --> 00:08:01,960
because you can grow a corn
so much prager and grass fed,

303
00:08:01,961 --> 00:08:04,060
it needs 50 acres that no other horse,

304
00:08:04,061 --> 00:08:04,751
no other bear,

305
00:08:04,751 --> 00:08:07,900
no other cougar know that all these
animals that you're talking about,

306
00:08:07,901 --> 00:08:10,060
no other animal can live on that area.

307
00:08:10,090 --> 00:08:11,590
Is that during the life of the animal?

308
00:08:11,660 --> 00:08:11,920
That's,

309
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:12,641
that's just period.

310
00:08:12,641 --> 00:08:13,474
That's just water.

311
00:08:13,820 --> 00:08:15,790
Water that's constantly.

312
00:08:15,791 --> 00:08:17,410
So imagine on a 50 foot fence.

313
00:08:17,770 --> 00:08:22,600
Nothing else was way more than 50 foot
50 slash 50 acres or 50 acres for one.

314
00:08:22,601 --> 00:08:25,750
So that's the last thing you want
to be eating is grassfed beef.

315
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:27,430
If you really care about the environment,

316
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:28,900
if you really care about wildlife,

317
00:08:28,930 --> 00:08:29,480
you,

318
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:31,750
you need to say either our fuck the cow,

319
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:32,710
screw the cow,

320
00:08:32,980 --> 00:08:34,510
the cow lives a miserable life.

321
00:08:34,511 --> 00:08:34,811
But you know,

322
00:08:34,811 --> 00:08:36,520
I care a lot about more like a,

323
00:08:36,580 --> 00:08:36,821
you know,

324
00:08:36,821 --> 00:08:37,490
about the,

325
00:08:37,490 --> 00:08:39,760
the elk and the Moose and the wolves.

326
00:08:39,761 --> 00:08:42,340
I care more about wildlife
than I do about this cow.

327
00:08:42,550 --> 00:08:44,380
You got to choose one or the
other if you're going to do it.

328
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:46,150
And if you really care about wildlife,

329
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:48,070
you got to say screw the cow.

330
00:08:48,130 --> 00:08:48,770
And then Sco,

331
00:08:48,770 --> 00:08:49,260
uh,

332
00:08:49,260 --> 00:08:50,150
with factory farm.

333
00:08:50,151 --> 00:08:55,151
And that's the whole irony of this whole
grass fed myth that's happening and

334
00:08:55,380 --> 00:08:55,680
what's,

335
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:57,830
that's what's kind of
ironic about the film.

336
00:08:57,831 --> 00:08:59,400
And people don't expect that shocking.
