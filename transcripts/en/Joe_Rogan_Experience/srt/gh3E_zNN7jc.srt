1
00:00:03,730 --> 00:00:04,330
Yeah,

2
00:00:04,330 --> 00:00:05,460
dude of history came back.

3
00:00:05,490 --> 00:00:06,570
If history struck back,

4
00:00:06,571 --> 00:00:07,230
do we would,

5
00:00:07,230 --> 00:00:08,130
I wouldn't make it.

6
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:09,113
I wouldn't,

7
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:10,260
I wouldn't make it long.

8
00:00:10,350 --> 00:00:10,651
Ah,

9
00:00:10,651 --> 00:00:11,484
you'd be fine.

10
00:00:11,610 --> 00:00:12,780
People are adaptable.

11
00:00:13,290 --> 00:00:13,801
You're smart,

12
00:00:13,801 --> 00:00:14,041
dude.

13
00:00:14,041 --> 00:00:14,640
Theo Vaughn,

14
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:15,241
I would lead,

15
00:00:15,241 --> 00:00:16,021
I would think a little bit.

16
00:00:16,021 --> 00:00:16,650
I would adapt.

17
00:00:16,650 --> 00:00:17,880
I'd lay low in the beginning.

18
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:18,541
You know,

19
00:00:18,541 --> 00:00:20,700
like somebody doesn't pick my battles.

20
00:00:20,701 --> 00:00:21,000
Dude.

21
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,500
You'd have to kill somebody immediately.

22
00:00:22,530 --> 00:00:24,180
You have to find the first
person in your group.

23
00:00:24,181 --> 00:00:26,910
The week is person and kill
them in front of everybody else.

24
00:00:26,940 --> 00:00:27,750
Yeah.

25
00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:28,800
If you were going to do that,

26
00:00:28,801 --> 00:00:32,850
the person wouldn't have to be either a
terrible person who is victimizing other

27
00:00:32,851 --> 00:00:35,370
people or they would,

28
00:00:35,371 --> 00:00:35,730
uh,

29
00:00:35,730 --> 00:00:37,800
have to have attacked
first who'd have to be,

30
00:00:37,890 --> 00:00:41,280
or they would have to been such a piece
of shit that people were rooting for

31
00:00:41,281 --> 00:00:41,670
you.

32
00:00:41,670 --> 00:00:43,800
Like somebody who was real
chatty and you just ask them,

33
00:00:44,540 --> 00:00:45,000
did,

34
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:45,660
there's no way.

35
00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:47,160
I'm sort of trying to survive like,

36
00:00:47,161 --> 00:00:47,630
uh,

37
00:00:47,630 --> 00:00:48,463
like uh,

38
00:00:48,570 --> 00:00:48,931
you know,

39
00:00:48,931 --> 00:00:52,740
the second coming of of the universe
and some dudes chatty and my group,

40
00:00:52,741 --> 00:00:53,140
bro.

41
00:00:53,140 --> 00:00:53,390
Oh,

42
00:00:53,390 --> 00:00:54,223
that's not,

43
00:00:54,330 --> 00:00:55,081
especially with like,

44
00:00:55,081 --> 00:00:56,430
he fucks up some hunting parties.

45
00:00:56,431 --> 00:00:59,040
You're out there like sneaking
up on a pig and he's like,

46
00:00:59,070 --> 00:00:59,641
oh my God,

47
00:00:59,641 --> 00:01:00,390
it's so hot out.

48
00:01:00,390 --> 00:01:03,630
You fucking the pig runs
away and everybody's hungry.

49
00:01:05,070 --> 00:01:07,440
Chatty would be the first man I
think about that kind of stuff.

50
00:01:07,441 --> 00:01:08,550
Like if a plane crash,

51
00:01:08,551 --> 00:01:09,710
I already know I'm planning ahead.

52
00:01:09,711 --> 00:01:11,310
Did I'd eat a Vietnamese guy.

53
00:01:11,740 --> 00:01:12,573
Why?

54
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:14,970
Cause it's easier to start or move.

55
00:01:14,971 --> 00:01:16,440
If you attack somebody bigger,

56
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:18,180
he eat somebody bigger
in front of other people.

57
00:01:18,181 --> 00:01:19,350
It's going to alarm people.

58
00:01:20,060 --> 00:01:21,360
You got to eat a small person.

59
00:01:21,390 --> 00:01:22,890
So stature is important.

60
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:25,830
I think if you come down a Viet people
aren't going to be that upset at you.

61
00:01:25,970 --> 00:01:26,200
What?

62
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:28,040
The Vietnamese people
are going to be super.

63
00:01:28,041 --> 00:01:28,950
So what are you talking about?

64
00:01:28,951 --> 00:01:29,880
Somebody whose dad,

65
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:33,150
they're more understanding of things.

66
00:01:33,151 --> 00:01:33,600
Dude,

67
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:34,950
this is a character you're playing.

68
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:36,113
No,

69
00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:37,860
but if you eat a black dude,

70
00:01:37,861 --> 00:01:39,760
you eat a black lady
and her family is there,

71
00:01:39,761 --> 00:01:40,950
they're going to be pissed.

72
00:01:41,130 --> 00:01:43,260
So you think it Vietnamese
person and we'll let you slide.

73
00:01:43,950 --> 00:01:46,440
I think that they'd be much more
forgiving over a couple of day period.

74
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:47,281
I think,

75
00:01:47,281 --> 00:01:47,700
uh,

76
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:48,600
like our relatives.

77
00:01:48,980 --> 00:01:50,670
I definitely think there'd
be super pissed at you.

78
00:01:51,150 --> 00:01:54,540
But what is interesting is like
Vietnam was one of the few places where

79
00:01:54,990 --> 00:01:59,430
Americans can go back to Vietnam and they
don't seem to hold any grudge at all.

80
00:02:00,090 --> 00:02:00,923
Exhibit a

81
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:04,080
exhibit a man.

82
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:04,590
Honestly.
