1
00:00:02,730 --> 00:00:05,040
Three,
two,

2
00:00:06,870 --> 00:00:07,920
boom.
We're live.

3
00:00:08,840 --> 00:00:10,580
How are you sir?
I'm very good,

4
00:00:10,581 --> 00:00:11,450
Joe.
It's good to meet you,

5
00:00:11,451 --> 00:00:12,284
man.
Great to meet you and thank you very 

6
00:00:12,981 --> 00:00:16,680
much for doing this.
I've learned more about coyotes over the

7
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:17,513
last couple of months reading your book 
and listening to your podcast with my 

8
00:00:19,671 --> 00:00:21,560
good friend Steve Rinella,
which was amazing.

9
00:00:22,290 --> 00:00:25,070
Whew.
What a crazy animal that is.

10
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:25,953
You know,
I have coyotes all around my 

11
00:00:26,661 --> 00:00:29,330
neighborhood and uh,
it became a very,

12
00:00:31,490 --> 00:00:32,323
very close to me when I saw one of my 
chickens get captured by a coyote and I 

13
00:00:36,470 --> 00:00:38,720
watched him hop the fence with a chicken
in his mouth,

14
00:00:38,730 --> 00:00:43,280
like God damn as motherfuckers and just 
all around us especially.

15
00:00:43,281 --> 00:00:46,130
I live in a fairly rural area around 
here.

16
00:00:46,490 --> 00:00:49,400
I'm about 40 minutes outside of La,
so it's,

17
00:00:49,460 --> 00:00:50,293
you know,
the nights are quiet and you hear him 

18
00:00:51,681 --> 00:00:52,514
screaming in the night and I didn't know
much about them until I started reading 

19
00:00:55,341 --> 00:00:56,174
your book,
man.

20
00:00:56,630 --> 00:00:57,920
Yeah,
they're amazing animal.

21
00:00:57,950 --> 00:00:58,761
I mean,
I think,

22
00:00:58,761 --> 00:00:59,594
uh,
there's not really another mammal side 

23
00:01:03,020 --> 00:01:07,280
from us that has a biography like these 
animals do and that's kind of one of the

24
00:01:07,281 --> 00:01:10,140
reasons I got fascinated with them.
Uh,

25
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:11,593
they were doing the same thing around me
when I was a kid growing up in 

26
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:16,340
Louisiana.
I mean,

27
00:01:16,341 --> 00:01:19,740
and that's sort of the beginning of my,
uh,

28
00:01:20,270 --> 00:01:21,103
my getting captivated by these little 
small wolves because they were suddenly 

29
00:01:25,731 --> 00:01:29,690
showing up in the bayous and swamps of 
Louisiana when I was 12,

30
00:01:29,691 --> 00:01:30,950
13,
14 years old.

31
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:32,233
And as far as I knew this was an animal 
that was supposed to be in the deserts 

32
00:01:35,631 --> 00:01:40,160
of the West.
And so that seemed to be something that,

33
00:01:40,180 --> 00:01:41,013
you know,
commanded one's attention that this 

34
00:01:44,361 --> 00:01:45,194
critter is,
is appearing in places where you would 

35
00:01:47,511 --> 00:01:48,344
never expect it.
And now of course everybody in the 

36
00:01:51,261 --> 00:01:52,640
country is dealing with them.

37
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:53,833
That is so fascinating that in our 
lifetime they have spread from the 

38
00:01:57,141 --> 00:01:57,974
American southwest to every single state
and literally every single city in the 

39
00:02:01,491 --> 00:02:02,324
country.
Yeah,

40
00:02:02,570 --> 00:02:04,820
that's true.
And I just got A.

41
00:02:04,820 --> 00:02:09,820
Somebody sent me this yesterday,
that somewhere in Georgia they have some

42
00:02:10,401 --> 00:02:14,180
sort of a bounty on these wolves.
Coyotes.

43
00:02:14,330 --> 00:02:17,390
That's one thing a lot of people don't 
realize that a coyote is a wolf.

44
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:19,010
Yeah,
it's a,

45
00:02:19,070 --> 00:02:22,610
it's a separate species from gray wolves
and red wolves,

46
00:02:22,611 --> 00:02:26,960
but it's out of the North American wolf 
line.

47
00:02:27,020 --> 00:02:27,860
Uh,
I mean,

48
00:02:27,861 --> 00:02:31,250
coyotes are distinctive,
laid North American animals.

49
00:02:31,251 --> 00:02:32,084
They come out of Canada evolution that 
began here five point 3 million years 

50
00:02:34,911 --> 00:02:36,140
ago.
So,

51
00:02:36,141 --> 00:02:36,861
um,
yeah,

52
00:02:36,861 --> 00:02:38,240
they're,
they're small wolves.

53
00:02:38,270 --> 00:02:39,890
And I sent you this,
Jamie know,

54
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:42,770
you found it beautiful.
This is the Georgia coyote challenge.

55
00:02:42,771 --> 00:02:46,970
Apparently they're offering some sort of
bounty for each coyote killed.

56
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:48,073
Now what's fascinating about this,
and one of the things that I learned 

57
00:02:50,421 --> 00:02:54,290
from your book is that when a coyote 
yells,

58
00:02:54,291 --> 00:02:56,390
when they're doing their call in the 
night,

59
00:02:56,391 --> 00:03:00,160
they're essentially making roll call and
when of them doesn't

60
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:03,640
respond,
the female generates more pups.

61
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:05,553
Yeah.
It's,

62
00:03:05,940 --> 00:03:07,900
it's one of the,
you know,

63
00:03:07,930 --> 00:03:10,120
one of the many things that's probably 
happening when they're,

64
00:03:10,150 --> 00:03:10,983
when they're howling,
I mean they are taking a census 

65
00:03:14,140 --> 00:03:17,530
basically of coyote populations in the 
area.

66
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:23,160
And the result of,
of that census can very well be,

67
00:03:23,561 --> 00:03:28,561
it produces some sort of a chemical or 
metabolic change in,

68
00:03:28,910 --> 00:03:31,300
in the females,
the breeding females,

69
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:36,160
the Alpha ones,
and they end up oftentimes having larger

70
00:03:36,161 --> 00:03:38,800
litters of pumps,
which is why something like this,

71
00:03:38,850 --> 00:03:39,683
you know,
I was just in South Carolina two weeks 

72
00:03:40,871 --> 00:03:43,630
ago and there was a lot of conversation 
about this,

73
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:44,513
this Georgia bounty because in South 
Carolina it's another place where 

74
00:03:48,011 --> 00:03:49,870
coyotes are,
are fairly new.

75
00:03:50,140 --> 00:03:52,330
I've only been there in the last 20 or 
25 years.

76
00:03:53,170 --> 00:03:55,270
They were arguing that,
you know,

77
00:03:55,271 --> 00:03:59,380
and they had some pretty good science 
that coyotes are taking,

78
00:03:59,410 --> 00:04:00,243
you know,
in some areas as many as 60 percent of 

79
00:04:02,891 --> 00:04:05,140
the white tail deer fawns.

80
00:04:05,470 --> 00:04:06,303
And so the hunters are screaming along a
lot about this because it means it's 

81
00:04:10,570 --> 00:04:13,980
getting harder to take a white tail.
Um,

82
00:04:14,590 --> 00:04:15,423
so South Carolina hasn't moved to the 
step that Georgia has of trying to 

83
00:04:19,751 --> 00:04:20,584
impose some kind of bounty and encourage
people to go out and shoot these 

84
00:04:24,101 --> 00:04:25,600
animals,
uh,

85
00:04:25,630 --> 00:04:29,140
to take them in any way they can,
but mostly shoot them.

86
00:04:29,900 --> 00:04:31,120
Uh,
but,

87
00:04:31,390 --> 00:04:32,223
you know,
I think the states in the south and in 

88
00:04:34,961 --> 00:04:35,794
the east have a lot to learn by the 
western or from the Western experience 

89
00:04:39,851 --> 00:04:40,684
because the truth is we've been trying 
to eradicate and I mean totally 

90
00:04:45,041 --> 00:04:48,010
exterminate coyotes in the American 
west.

91
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:49,553
Uh,
we spent the years from about Nineteen 

92
00:04:51,281 --> 00:04:56,281
15 through about 1972 in an all out war 
attempting to exterminate them.

93
00:04:58,060 --> 00:05:01,030
And the only result of that,
uh,

94
00:05:01,031 --> 00:05:01,864
as a result of their particular kinds of
adaptations in their evolution in North 

95
00:05:06,460 --> 00:05:07,510
America,
uh,

96
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:10,780
is that we spread them across the entire
country.

97
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:13,990
We not only spread them across the 
entire country,

98
00:05:13,991 --> 00:05:16,630
I mean they're in every state.
They colonize their 49th state,

99
00:05:16,631 --> 00:05:18,970
Delaware in 2010.
So the only state,

100
00:05:18,971 --> 00:05:19,804
they're not in his Hawaii just because 
they have a stowed away and made it 

101
00:05:23,530 --> 00:05:25,920
across the Pacific yet.
And uh,

102
00:05:25,930 --> 00:05:27,190
you know,
I mean if they do,

103
00:05:27,191 --> 00:05:28,024
you can imagine those endangered 
Naynay's on the big island are totally 

104
00:05:31,061 --> 00:05:31,894
done for.
But they are not only at every single 

105
00:05:34,091 --> 00:05:39,091
state in the union except for awhile,
but they are 7,000 miles now,

106
00:05:39,251 --> 00:05:44,251
north and south and North America from 
above the Arctic circle all the way down

107
00:05:45,101 --> 00:05:50,101
to Central America and beginning to 
colonize into South America.

108
00:05:50,860 --> 00:05:55,780
So the attempts to exterminate them,
I mean I can explain how this,

109
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:56,793
why this happens,
has to do with their evolution in the 

110
00:05:58,821 --> 00:05:59,654
particular adaptations they have,
but the attempts to exterminate them or 

111
00:06:02,631 --> 00:06:03,464
even to try to control their numbers 
almost always produces exactly the 

112
00:06:07,581 --> 00:06:08,420
opposite effect.

113
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:09,313
So Georgia is going to end up with more 
coyotes than they've ever had before in 

114
00:06:14,601 --> 00:06:16,940
their efforts to try to suppress their 
population.

115
00:06:17,150 --> 00:06:19,130
Isn't that fascinating?
And it is.

116
00:06:19,460 --> 00:06:20,293
It's so contrary to logic and what you 
would think would be the solution for 

117
00:06:23,961 --> 00:06:24,794
something like that.
I mean,

118
00:06:25,100 --> 00:06:27,260
and when you go back to the American 
west,

119
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:32,300
before the reintroduction of wolves into
yellowstone in the 19 nineties,

120
00:06:32,540 --> 00:06:37,540
we had essentially extirpated them from 
a vast majority of the United States.

121
00:06:37,671 --> 00:06:38,960
There's very,
very few left,

122
00:06:38,961 --> 00:06:39,794
right?
That's true.

123
00:06:40,010 --> 00:06:42,800
And the,
we'll see if he could believe,

124
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:46,390
explained the relationship that the gray
wolves had to the coyotes,

125
00:06:46,430 --> 00:06:49,310
which is one of the reasons that the 
coyotes became so adaptable.

126
00:06:50,270 --> 00:06:51,051
It's true.
I mean,

127
00:06:51,051 --> 00:06:53,900
they didn't.
Coyotes didn't become so smart,

128
00:06:54,050 --> 00:06:55,570
you know,
and in the southwest,

129
00:06:55,580 --> 00:07:00,560
the Hispanics say the only thing that's 
smarter than a coyote is God,

130
00:07:01,550 --> 00:07:05,410
but they didn't become that smart and 
that adept,

131
00:07:05,420 --> 00:07:09,380
that surviving anything almost that 
happens to them.

132
00:07:10,220 --> 00:07:12,140
Um,
because of us,

133
00:07:12,141 --> 00:07:12,974
I mean,
we've only been trying to wipe them out 

134
00:07:16,251 --> 00:07:19,390
or control their populations for a 
little more than a century nouse.

135
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:20,233
And that's too short a time for them to 
evolve these abilities to adapt and 

136
00:07:24,441 --> 00:07:25,880
survive.
They,

137
00:07:26,450 --> 00:07:27,283
they evolved those abilities because 
they were the small dog and a big dog's 

138
00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:33,133
world.
And I mean gray wolves have this very 

139
00:07:36,261 --> 00:07:41,261
interesting story to gray wolves come 
out of North American kainate evolution,

140
00:07:41,361 --> 00:07:42,194
but they're one of the Canaan species 
that ended up leaving North America for 

141
00:07:45,651 --> 00:07:50,270
a time and evolving for a couple of 
million years in Asia and in Europe.

142
00:07:50,450 --> 00:07:51,283
And they didn't come back.
A gray wolves didn't start coming back 

143
00:07:54,051 --> 00:07:54,884
to North America till about 25 or 30,000
years ago during sort of the height of 

144
00:07:58,671 --> 00:07:59,504
the late pleistocene and when they did,
coyote is of course had been here and 

145
00:08:04,551 --> 00:08:09,470
had evolved into their present species 
about 800,000 to a million years ago.

146
00:08:09,770 --> 00:08:10,603
And when gray wolves returned,
I mean they basically just started 

147
00:08:13,701 --> 00:08:14,534
kicking the crap out of coyotes.
And so coyotes evolve their ability to 

148
00:08:19,941 --> 00:08:20,774
survive being harassed and persecuted as
a result of being a basically harassed 

149
00:08:26,691 --> 00:08:27,524
by gray wolves.
So this is why when you hear about the 

150
00:08:30,351 --> 00:08:32,570
Coi Wolf that you hear on the east 
coast,

151
00:08:32,780 --> 00:08:33,613
this is a,
a coyote that bread with the red wolf 

152
00:08:35,660 --> 00:08:37,670
and,
and other eastern wolves,

153
00:08:37,730 --> 00:08:38,750
correct?
That's correct.

154
00:08:38,751 --> 00:08:39,584
Yeah.
And that's,

155
00:08:39,620 --> 00:08:40,453
I mean,
it's a very interesting story and it's 

156
00:08:42,591 --> 00:08:43,424
kind of one of those instances where a 
modern event that we're all getting to 

157
00:08:49,311 --> 00:08:54,311
witness the emergence of the Coi.
Wolf has its origins in the evolution of

158
00:08:57,780 --> 00:08:58,613
mammals in North America,
a million years or more because the 

159
00:09:03,391 --> 00:09:04,290
raisin,
I mean,

160
00:09:04,291 --> 00:09:07,860
if you think about this,
the reason coyotes,

161
00:09:08,070 --> 00:09:12,210
red wolves and other eastern wolves like
the Algonquin Wolf,

162
00:09:12,790 --> 00:09:14,510
uh,
in eastern Canada and,

163
00:09:14,570 --> 00:09:15,403
and northern New England,
the reason those animals can all hybrid 

164
00:09:18,861 --> 00:09:21,150
eyes and readily do,
I mean they,

165
00:09:21,151 --> 00:09:25,170
there are no behavioral barriers at all 
to them breeding with one another.

166
00:09:25,170 --> 00:09:28,150
And so whenever a coyote shows up,
um,

167
00:09:28,290 --> 00:09:31,980
and it's in the vicinity of a,
an Algonquin Wolf,

168
00:09:31,981 --> 00:09:33,750
say a female that comes into heat,
I mean,

169
00:09:33,751 --> 00:09:34,584
she'll readily pick a coyote as a mate.
But the reason they do that is because 

170
00:09:39,930 --> 00:09:41,940
those animals,
red wolves,

171
00:09:41,941 --> 00:09:46,020
eastern wolves of various kinds and 
coyotes all seemed to have come out of a

172
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:47,273
group of animals that unlike the gray 
wolf never left North America and they 

173
00:09:51,661 --> 00:09:52,494
probably didn't separate from one 
another until 300,000 to a half million 

174
00:09:58,021 --> 00:10:01,830
years ago.
So that separation is recent enough that

175
00:10:01,831 --> 00:10:04,500
whenever they encounter one enough with 
one another today,

176
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:07,110
they very readily hybridize.
I mean,

177
00:10:07,111 --> 00:10:07,944
it's sort of the result of coyote 
spreading across the south has 

178
00:10:12,421 --> 00:10:17,421
essentially kind of killed our hope that
we were going to save the endangered red

179
00:10:18,361 --> 00:10:19,194
wolf as an independent species because 
red wolf so quickly and easily 

180
00:10:23,881 --> 00:10:28,230
hybridized with coyotes that coyote 
genes swamp pure red wolf jeans.

181
00:10:29,010 --> 00:10:32,490
So I mean that's something that you 
know,

182
00:10:32,491 --> 00:10:37,080
is millions of years or hundreds of 
thousands of years old and evolution,

183
00:10:37,081 --> 00:10:40,200
but we're getting to see it play out 
right around us in our own time.

184
00:10:40,410 --> 00:10:41,243
And meanwhile,
gray wolves and coyotes in the West 

185
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:44,513
aren't hybridizing it all.
And so that's the explanation is that 

186
00:10:47,131 --> 00:10:50,950
gray wolves left and didn't come back 
until why left?

187
00:10:51,510 --> 00:10:52,020
Well,
they,

188
00:10:52,020 --> 00:10:55,920
they just,
they happen to be in evolutionary terms.

189
00:10:55,980 --> 00:10:56,813
One of the groups and jackals did the 
same thing that they ended up leaving 

190
00:11:00,901 --> 00:11:01,734
North America and in their absence,
while they were in another part of the 

191
00:11:05,731 --> 00:11:06,564
world,
they evolved into the present 

192
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:11,970
subspecies.
We've got four subspecies of gray wolves

193
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:15,720
in North America,
all of which seemed to have come back to

194
00:11:15,721 --> 00:11:17,910
North America by the way,
at different times.

195
00:11:18,510 --> 00:11:21,750
So they had sort of separate migrations 
back to North America.

196
00:11:21,751 --> 00:11:24,690
So the Mexican Gray Wolf,
uh,

197
00:11:24,691 --> 00:11:27,540
the,
the western gray wolf,

198
00:11:27,570 --> 00:11:32,570
the Arctic Wolf,
these are all gray wolf species,

199
00:11:33,151 --> 00:11:37,080
but they're separated at the sub 
specific level and they all seem to have

200
00:11:37,081 --> 00:11:38,820
come back to North America at different 
times.

201
00:11:39,450 --> 00:11:40,283
But they,
they had left North America like about 

202
00:11:42,540 --> 00:11:43,373
three and a half million years ago.
And so they became different animals in 

203
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:47,273
Asia and Europe by the time they came 
back then they were different enough 

204
00:11:50,971 --> 00:11:55,971
from coyotes that they not only couldn't
interbreed with them anymore,

205
00:11:56,590 --> 00:12:00,340
but they sort of are mortal enemies of 
one another.

206
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:01,353
I mean,
when we reintroduced wolves to 

207
00:12:02,441 --> 00:12:05,980
yellowstone in 1995,
coyotes had,

208
00:12:05,981 --> 00:12:09,130
had 75 years in yellowstone without any 
wolves.

209
00:12:09,190 --> 00:12:10,023
I mean,
and that served as a wonderful 

210
00:12:11,861 --> 00:12:12,694
laboratory to study them too because it 
gave us a sense of what happens with 

211
00:12:16,751 --> 00:12:20,710
coyotes when nobody is harassing them 
when people are harassing him,

212
00:12:20,711 --> 00:12:21,544
which of course we didn't in yellowstone
park and when wolves aren't harassing 

213
00:12:25,031 --> 00:12:25,864
them either.
And what we realize is that they create 

214
00:12:28,211 --> 00:12:29,044
these really stable territory's.
They create very stable packs and their 

215
00:12:32,831 --> 00:12:33,664
population rises to a particular point,
the carrying capacity of the landscape 

216
00:12:37,570 --> 00:12:38,403
based on what they eat,
which is mostly rodents and rabbits and 

217
00:12:40,751 --> 00:12:45,751
things and some fruit and berries,
but it doesn't.

218
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:47,193
They don't.
Their population sort of levels off and 

219
00:12:49,601 --> 00:12:50,434
stays at a carrying capacity.
And so we got to watch that happen in 

220
00:12:54,971 --> 00:12:59,971
yellowstone for like 75 years and it's 
become sort of the,

221
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:05,440
the example of what would happen if we 
just left them alone.

222
00:13:05,980 --> 00:13:07,060
I mean some people think,
well,

223
00:13:07,061 --> 00:13:09,310
if we don't try to control them how 
they're gonna,

224
00:13:09,430 --> 00:13:10,263
you know,
they're just going to be millions upon 

225
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:15,490
millions of them running everywhere,
but that's actually.

226
00:13:15,970 --> 00:13:16,803
They only do that when you try to 
persecute them and they go into this 

227
00:13:19,661 --> 00:13:20,494
colonization mode and generate more and 
more and more pups and have more and 

228
00:13:23,921 --> 00:13:27,910
more pups survive.
So yellowstone in that period from 19,

229
00:13:27,911 --> 00:13:28,744
25 to 1995 was this sort of model of 
what happens when you just leave them 

230
00:13:34,750 --> 00:13:35,583
the hell alone and they just kind of 
rise to a particular population level 

231
00:13:41,861 --> 00:13:44,530
and are really stable at that level.

232
00:13:44,590 --> 00:13:45,423
And uh,
and don't really go beyond it and they 

233
00:13:47,171 --> 00:13:49,720
don't expand their territory that we 
either know.

234
00:13:49,721 --> 00:13:50,890
They don't seem to.
I mean,

235
00:13:50,891 --> 00:13:55,891
one of the things that has happened 
obviously in the last a hundred years or

236
00:13:56,111 --> 00:14:01,111
so last 75 years at least,
is that as a result of persecuting them,

237
00:14:02,140 --> 00:14:06,940
we've sent them into this kind of 
colonization strategy where they,

238
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:11,830
they have larger litter of pups when 
their populations are suppressed,

239
00:14:11,831 --> 00:14:16,660
it's easier for them to get the pumps 
that they do have to adulthood.

240
00:14:17,590 --> 00:14:18,423
I mean in yellowstone for example,
one of the things we saw in that period 

241
00:14:21,491 --> 00:14:24,520
when they weren't being harassed in the 
60 seventies,

242
00:14:24,521 --> 00:14:25,354
eighties is that they would have a 
litter of five or six pups and they 

243
00:14:29,681 --> 00:14:32,110
could only get a couple of them to 
adulthood.

244
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:33,633
But whenever you try to control their 
populations and momentarily suppressed 

245
00:14:38,491 --> 00:14:40,330
their populations,
I mean,

246
00:14:40,331 --> 00:14:41,164
the result is that there's no more food 
for coyotes out there for the coyotes 

247
00:14:44,291 --> 00:14:45,640
that,
that have survived.

248
00:14:46,300 --> 00:14:50,950
And that makes it possible for them to 
have a litter of seven or eight pups and

249
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:55,960
get six to seven of them to adulthood.
And then they have this,

250
00:14:56,390 --> 00:14:58,760
this marvelous ability,
I mean,

251
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:03,830
I talk about it a good bit in the book,
it's called fish and fusion there,

252
00:15:03,831 --> 00:15:04,664
one of the few species and we happened 
to be one of the other mammal species 

253
00:15:07,191 --> 00:15:08,024
around the world that does this,
where they have the ability to exist as 

254
00:15:13,341 --> 00:15:17,270
a social animal and a case of coyotes as
a pack animal of course.

255
00:15:18,140 --> 00:15:18,973
But whenever they're pressured,
they tend to split apart into singles 

256
00:15:24,860 --> 00:15:25,693
and pairs and they scatter across the 
landscape and that's what sends them 

257
00:15:31,011 --> 00:15:31,844
colonizing across the continent.
The fact that they can do that is what 

258
00:15:35,241 --> 00:15:36,740
separates them really from wolves.
Right.

259
00:15:36,741 --> 00:15:38,870
And that's why they weren't able to wipe
them out in the west.

260
00:15:38,930 --> 00:15:40,310
Yeah,
that's exactly what I mean.

261
00:15:40,311 --> 00:15:42,830
If you think about what happened with 
gray wolves,

262
00:15:42,831 --> 00:15:45,170
I mean we started,
uh,

263
00:15:45,171 --> 00:15:46,004
the sort of in a decided effort to 
eliminate gray wolves from the American 

264
00:15:52,521 --> 00:15:54,680
West in roughly.
I mean,

265
00:15:54,681 --> 00:15:55,514
we started just ordinary people started 
putting out strychnine bait for them in 

266
00:15:59,271 --> 00:16:01,160
the 18,
16 and 18 seventies.

267
00:16:01,161 --> 00:16:04,310
But was it ranchers at first it started 
that it was it because of livestock?

268
00:16:04,540 --> 00:16:05,373
Yeah,
it was ranchers and just travelers on 

269
00:16:06,981 --> 00:16:09,500
the Oregon trail,
on the emigrant trails.

270
00:16:09,501 --> 00:16:10,334
I mean people sort of regarded because 
they came out of Europe with a 

271
00:16:14,751 --> 00:16:16,910
background with wolves.
I mean,

272
00:16:16,911 --> 00:16:17,744
that's,
that's one of the things that 

273
00:16:17,961 --> 00:16:18,794
distinguishes us Americans and coyotes 
is that we didn't have coyotes in 

274
00:16:23,091 --> 00:16:23,924
Europe,
so we didn't arrive with this preloaded 

275
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:30,260
preconception about the role that 
[inaudible] played in the world,

276
00:16:30,740 --> 00:16:33,650
but we did with animals like bears and 
wolves.

277
00:16:34,190 --> 00:16:36,680
And so people just from the very 
beginning,

278
00:16:36,740 --> 00:16:40,610
whenever the Atlantic seaboard was 
settled,

279
00:16:41,390 --> 00:16:45,830
uh,
there were wolf drives and wolf roundups

280
00:16:45,831 --> 00:16:50,831
and every kind of attempt to wipe out 
wolves as competitors with us,

281
00:16:52,700 --> 00:16:55,850
for our stock.
So in the west,

282
00:16:55,851 --> 00:16:58,330
people just through strychnine bait out,
let me.

283
00:16:58,350 --> 00:17:01,520
Strychnine was invented in Pennsylvania 
in 18,

284
00:17:01,521 --> 00:17:04,510
48 and it was widely available,
uh,

285
00:17:04,580 --> 00:17:05,413
in places like Missouri when you set out
across the West and people would just 

286
00:17:08,721 --> 00:17:10,270
buy a bunch of baits.
I mean they would,

287
00:17:10,340 --> 00:17:12,560
if they hung around long enough to get 
the animal,

288
00:17:12,561 --> 00:17:14,750
they would skin it and try to sell the 
pill,

289
00:17:15,080 --> 00:17:20,080
but they just poisoned them like crazy.
Then in starting in Nineteen 15,

290
00:17:20,511 --> 00:17:24,890
this government agency called the bureau
of biological survey,

291
00:17:24,891 --> 00:17:29,891
which positions itself as the solution 
to predators first decides that it's the

292
00:17:31,641 --> 00:17:32,474
wolf that we need to take out and I mean
they managed to take out the the last 

293
00:17:40,970 --> 00:17:41,803
probably quarter million wolves in the 
West in the space of a little more than 

294
00:17:45,741 --> 00:17:49,920
a decade and they do it as you just 
mentioned,

295
00:17:49,921 --> 00:17:53,760
primarily because wolves are such pack 
animals,

296
00:17:53,820 --> 00:17:58,820
so pack oriented that if you could kill 
our trap one member of a pack,

297
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:01,793
you could use the scent from that animal
and ended up catching every single 

298
00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:06,293
animal in the pack,
but coyotes responded to that kind of 

299
00:18:09,991 --> 00:18:11,880
pressure in a very different way.

300
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:14,700
I mean,
when you started pressuring them,

301
00:18:15,060 --> 00:18:17,280
they tended,
their packs tended to break up.

302
00:18:17,310 --> 00:18:22,310
They tended to scatter and go into this 
fish mode and so indeed,

303
00:18:22,441 --> 00:18:23,274
as you said a minute ago,
that's exactly why we were able to take 

304
00:18:27,001 --> 00:18:29,370
out wolves.
By the middle of the 19 twenties,

305
00:18:29,371 --> 00:18:32,250
we pretty much had resolved the wolf 
issue in the west,

306
00:18:32,251 --> 00:18:36,600
but year after year after year as wolf 
numbers a decline.

307
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:39,720
I mean,
I'll offer an example in Montana,

308
00:18:39,721 --> 00:18:40,730
for instance,
18,

309
00:18:40,740 --> 00:18:41,573
99,
the State of Montana boundaried 23,000 

310
00:18:45,930 --> 00:18:47,430
wolves.
I was 18,

311
00:18:47,431 --> 00:18:51,840
99,
21 years later by 1920.

312
00:18:52,380 --> 00:18:53,213
They only paid bounties on 17 gray 
wolves because they had basically wiped 

313
00:18:58,141 --> 00:18:58,974
them out and then the government agency,
the biological survey came in and 

314
00:19:02,191 --> 00:19:03,024
cleaned up all the rest of them,
but every year from 1899 slash 19 slash 

315
00:19:06,530 --> 00:19:09,960
21 and right on into the 19 thirties in 
Montana,

316
00:19:10,020 --> 00:19:14,340
they were bouncing 30,000 coyotes in 18,
99 and 1910.

317
00:19:14,370 --> 00:19:18,450
30,000 coyotes and 1918,
33,000 coyotes.

318
00:19:18,451 --> 00:19:19,284
I mean the number of coyotes never 
dropped while wolf populations just 

319
00:19:22,660 --> 00:19:24,630
plummeted.
Data is so fascinating.

320
00:19:24,631 --> 00:19:27,200
What a crazy little animal that is.
It is.

321
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:28,913
It's a.
it's so wonderfully counterintuitive in 

322
00:19:34,201 --> 00:19:35,034
the whole kind of environmental story of
America because what you always expect 

323
00:19:38,881 --> 00:19:43,881
is that anytime we put our mind to 
taking on some creature and,

324
00:19:44,261 --> 00:19:46,200
and taking it out,
I mean we can do it.

325
00:19:46,890 --> 00:19:48,320
I mean,
you know,

326
00:19:48,390 --> 00:19:49,223
the only time this never really happened
was in Moby Dick where captain Ahab is 

327
00:19:54,391 --> 00:19:58,560
driven mad by his inability to control 
the great white whale and the control of

328
00:19:58,561 --> 00:20:03,280
nature and that in a lot of places that 
seems to be where we,

329
00:20:03,810 --> 00:20:08,810
we land when people realized that you 
can't do anything about coyotes,

330
00:20:09,900 --> 00:20:10,733
it Kinda drives people out of their 
minds because this is just not the 

331
00:20:14,341 --> 00:20:15,174
American way.

332
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:19,070
We can always deal with an animal.
Yeah,

333
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:19,913
it is a,
it's got to be very frustrating to 

334
00:20:21,271 --> 00:20:22,890
people and a lot of ways,
but it's,

335
00:20:22,891 --> 00:20:24,780
it's kind of amazing.
I mean,

336
00:20:24,781 --> 00:20:27,310
it's really kind of magical and a lot of
ways that,

337
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:31,980
that they're so,
they're so adaptable and that all came,

338
00:20:31,981 --> 00:20:34,770
you're saying because of their 
relationship with the gray wolf.

339
00:20:35,070 --> 00:20:37,140
Now how do we know that the gray wolf 
left?

340
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:39,353
Well,
we know that they're still wolves in 

341
00:20:42,451 --> 00:20:43,720
America.
Uh,

342
00:20:43,930 --> 00:20:46,380
there's no question about that.
And so,

343
00:20:46,381 --> 00:20:49,150
I mean,
that is a tricky question.

344
00:20:49,180 --> 00:20:51,310
I mean,
there is a,

345
00:20:51,370 --> 00:20:52,930
you know,
so I would hasten to say,

346
00:20:52,990 --> 00:20:54,910
first of all,
I'm not a geneticist.

347
00:20:55,180 --> 00:20:56,013
I'm not even a biologist.
I'm basically an environmental writer 

348
00:20:58,940 --> 00:21:02,970
and somebody who uses history a lot,
um,

349
00:21:05,230 --> 00:21:08,800
and there is unresolved science out 
there and buy what I mean.

350
00:21:09,070 --> 00:21:09,903
What I mean by that is that there are a 
couple of different camps that have 

351
00:21:17,891 --> 00:21:22,180
advanced positions about the 
relationship between all these different

352
00:21:22,181 --> 00:21:26,290
wolves that we have in North America and
coyotes.

353
00:21:26,950 --> 00:21:31,810
So there is a guy at Ucla,
I'm here in Los Angeles.

354
00:21:32,670 --> 00:21:34,240
Uh,
his name was Robert Wayne,

355
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:35,233
uh,
and he has done a genetic work on chain 

356
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:41,130
[inaudible].
I'm,

357
00:21:41,320 --> 00:21:43,090
one of his papers is called,
uh,

358
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:44,433
uh,
the title includes the phrase and 

359
00:21:45,861 --> 00:21:48,430
Magmatic Wolf,
like Canids,

360
00:21:49,180 --> 00:21:52,870
and he's done the genetic analysis on 
coyotes,

361
00:21:52,871 --> 00:21:54,520
red wolves,
gray wolves,

362
00:21:54,580 --> 00:21:59,140
and eastern wolves.
And his argument is that

363
00:22:02,860 --> 00:22:04,930
gray wolves,
red wolves,

364
00:22:04,990 --> 00:22:09,990
and eastern wolves are all actually some
version of gray wolves.

365
00:22:13,510 --> 00:22:14,343
So that's a different argument than the 
one that I made for you just a few 

366
00:22:17,560 --> 00:22:19,030
minutes ago.
I've been following,

367
00:22:19,031 --> 00:22:23,350
and I've followed in my book because I 
found it a more compelling argument,

368
00:22:24,220 --> 00:22:27,850
one advanced by a group of geneticists 
from Canada,

369
00:22:27,851 --> 00:22:31,060
led by a guy named Paul Wilson.
And that's the,

370
00:22:31,180 --> 00:22:32,013
that's the position that the US fish and
wildlife service and it's endangered 

371
00:22:35,711 --> 00:22:40,711
species division takes.
And their argument is that the gray wolf

372
00:22:41,710 --> 00:22:46,330
is a separate animal from the Red Wolf,
the eastern wolf,

373
00:22:46,360 --> 00:22:47,500
and the coyote,
they,

374
00:22:47,740 --> 00:22:50,560
they argue that coyotes,
red wolves,

375
00:22:50,920 --> 00:22:54,460
and eastern wolves all come out of a 
clade,

376
00:22:54,860 --> 00:22:56,500
the biological term,
c,

377
00:22:56,910 --> 00:22:57,611
c,
l a,

378
00:22:57,611 --> 00:22:58,444
d,
e,

379
00:22:58,540 --> 00:23:02,560
a clade of animals that are purely North
American in origin.

380
00:23:02,561 --> 00:23:03,394
And that had a,
probably a similar ancestor as recently 

381
00:23:07,031 --> 00:23:10,810
as maybe 300,000 years to 500,000 years 
ago.

382
00:23:11,980 --> 00:23:16,980
So we've got two different arguments 
about the relationship of coyotes to two

383
00:23:17,751 --> 00:23:20,980
worlds and I don't know who's going to 
win it,

384
00:23:20,981 --> 00:23:23,590
but one of the reasons I tend to sort of
favor the,

385
00:23:24,370 --> 00:23:25,203
the Paul Wilson Line of argument and the
one that the US fish and wildlife 

386
00:23:29,411 --> 00:23:32,180
service is using is because they use 
some,

387
00:23:32,260 --> 00:23:33,093
they use evidence beyond just genetics.
They also use morphology and they use 

388
00:23:37,181 --> 00:23:39,250
fossils.
Uh,

389
00:23:39,251 --> 00:23:42,700
and uh,
Robert Wayne and the group,

390
00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:43,873
a geneticists who work with him all 
seemed just rely specifically on 

391
00:23:48,381 --> 00:23:49,214
genetics.
And they don't ever try to verify there 

392
00:23:51,501 --> 00:23:53,660
findings by looking at the fossil 
record,

393
00:23:53,661 --> 00:23:55,460
for example.
Um,

394
00:23:55,670 --> 00:23:59,960
so I don't know how it's going to play 
out between these two groups,

395
00:23:59,961 --> 00:24:00,794
but I find the argument,
the Canadian geneticists that has 

396
00:24:06,021 --> 00:24:06,854
informed the US fish and wildlife 
services strategy a little bit more 

397
00:24:09,890 --> 00:24:11,480
compelling right now.
But I mean,

398
00:24:11,481 --> 00:24:13,010
it's something to pay attention to.

399
00:24:13,010 --> 00:24:14,180
We'll see how it goes.
Well,

400
00:24:14,181 --> 00:24:15,014
it seems like you,
you need some sort of a really 

401
00:24:17,121 --> 00:24:17,954
comprehensive way of looking at it 
because you're dealing with so many 

402
00:24:20,541 --> 00:24:21,500
different factors,
right?

403
00:24:21,501 --> 00:24:26,501
If you're trying to acquire evidence 
based on 25,000 years ago,

404
00:24:26,540 --> 00:24:28,670
it seems like there's got to be a lot of
different ways.

405
00:24:29,020 --> 00:24:33,830
It just,
it's very odd to me that we know as much

406
00:24:33,831 --> 00:24:34,670
as we do.
No,

407
00:24:34,730 --> 00:24:35,563
I mean in to try to figure it all out as
got to be incredibly frustrating when 

408
00:24:39,411 --> 00:24:42,440
you're dealing with so little evidence 
and you're looking at the fossil record.

409
00:24:42,441 --> 00:24:45,890
I mean a lot of the animals that die 
25,000 years ago,

410
00:24:45,891 --> 00:24:47,720
there's zero evidence of them,
right?

411
00:24:47,810 --> 00:24:48,980
Yeah,
that's right.

412
00:24:49,010 --> 00:24:51,230
I mean,
a 25,000 years ago,

413
00:24:51,231 --> 00:24:53,560
for example,
and the light pleistocene,

414
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:55,233
uh,
the evidence from labrea tar pit 

415
00:24:57,020 --> 00:25:01,640
indicates that coyotes were a slightly 
different animal than they are now.

416
00:25:01,670 --> 00:25:03,330
They were,
uh,

417
00:25:03,350 --> 00:25:07,640
at the time we think gray wolves were 
coming back into North America,

418
00:25:07,700 --> 00:25:09,650
returning to their evolutionary 
homeland.

419
00:25:10,040 --> 00:25:12,710
Coyotes were much bigger,
more strapping,

420
00:25:12,711 --> 00:25:15,410
had larger dentition,
stronger jaws.

421
00:25:16,310 --> 00:25:17,143
And what looks like happened is when 
gray wolves arrived in the west and 

422
00:25:21,741 --> 00:25:25,280
began competing with these larger,
more strapping coyotes,

423
00:25:25,910 --> 00:25:29,630
coyotes sort of sought a different path.
They,

424
00:25:30,140 --> 00:25:35,140
they sort of stepped back away from 
outright competition with an even bigger

425
00:25:35,950 --> 00:25:40,350
Canaan and evolved into a smaller,
more grass.

426
00:25:40,351 --> 00:25:45,351
I'll animal that was not so much just a 
pure Predator and scavenger,

427
00:25:45,741 --> 00:25:49,370
but more omnivorous and so became our 
modern canus,

428
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:52,130
lutron's species.
But yeah,

429
00:25:52,131 --> 00:25:53,430
it's a.
and I was,

430
00:25:53,540 --> 00:25:54,620
we'll say,
you know,

431
00:25:54,621 --> 00:25:56,360
as you mentioned a minute ago,
I mean,

432
00:25:56,361 --> 00:25:57,194
it's hard to know all of this.
Much of this information is fairly 

433
00:26:00,801 --> 00:26:02,330
recent.
I mean,

434
00:26:02,331 --> 00:26:03,164
we just got a kind of a reappraisal of 
the taxonomy of the North American 

435
00:26:08,841 --> 00:26:13,490
wolves essentially in the last seven or 
eight or 10 years.

436
00:26:13,850 --> 00:26:16,910
Our other wolves omnivorous,
or is it just coyotes?

437
00:26:17,630 --> 00:26:19,670
Well,
wolves can be omnivorous,

438
00:26:19,671 --> 00:26:23,840
but they're,
they're pretty much really a carnivorous

439
00:26:24,170 --> 00:26:25,370
pack.
Predators.

440
00:26:25,490 --> 00:26:29,990
I find coyote crap in my yard all the 
time and it's got berries in it.

441
00:26:30,050 --> 00:26:30,890
Oh yeah.
Yeah.

442
00:26:31,030 --> 00:26:33,860
Like they eat a lot of these little red 
berries that grow out here.

443
00:26:33,890 --> 00:26:34,301
Yeah.
They,

444
00:26:34,301 --> 00:26:35,630
they eat juniper's.
I mean,

445
00:26:35,631 --> 00:26:36,464
the same thing is happening at all.
My place in New Mexico starting 

446
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:41,630
essentially about in August or 
September,

447
00:26:42,050 --> 00:26:45,000
all the coyote droppings that I've found
on the place.

448
00:26:45,060 --> 00:26:45,893
I mean,
and I've got a lot of coyotes on my 

449
00:26:46,531 --> 00:26:48,340
place in New Mexico,
uh,

450
00:26:48,420 --> 00:26:50,400
has just been filled with juniper 
berries.

451
00:26:50,401 --> 00:26:52,620
That's what they've been eating.
I mean they,

452
00:26:52,740 --> 00:26:53,740
they still are,
you know,

453
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:57,420
running down rabbits and eating rats and
mice and things.

454
00:26:57,421 --> 00:27:00,390
But I mean,
when they move into cities,

455
00:27:00,391 --> 00:27:03,750
they tend to eat and they have access to
fruit trees.

456
00:27:04,020 --> 00:27:06,630
They tend to eat a lot of fruit.
So they'll,

457
00:27:06,680 --> 00:27:07,131
I mean,
you know,

458
00:27:07,131 --> 00:27:07,964
that people have posted photos on the 
internet or youtube videos that show 

459
00:27:14,221 --> 00:27:15,054
them plucking apples and peaches and 
things off trees in their backyards and 

460
00:27:18,750 --> 00:27:21,570
they really go for that sort of stuff.
So bizarre.

461
00:27:22,120 --> 00:27:22,953
It was just such a strange animal.
And so do we know if wolves do anything 

462
00:27:27,421 --> 00:27:29,640
like that or is it just a coyote 
characteristic?

463
00:27:29,970 --> 00:27:31,680
It's pretty much a coyote 
characteristic.

464
00:27:31,681 --> 00:27:32,590
I mean,
you know,

465
00:27:32,591 --> 00:27:34,890
as,
as we've been saying,

466
00:27:35,460 --> 00:27:40,460
the coyote in an evolutionary sense is 
a,

467
00:27:41,040 --> 00:27:43,620
a small wolf.
Um,

468
00:27:44,040 --> 00:27:48,570
but it is different,
especially from gray wolves.

469
00:27:48,660 --> 00:27:51,880
And one of the ways it's different,
uh,

470
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:52,793
that the biologist and the 
behavioralists who have watched coyotes 

471
00:27:56,850 --> 00:27:59,940
interact with one another and watch gray
wolves interact with one another,

472
00:28:00,510 --> 00:28:01,343
is an indication of how much more pack 
oriented Hanse sort of predatory 

473
00:28:06,121 --> 00:28:11,121
carnivorous wolves are wolves because 
they exist mostly as despite our,

474
00:28:13,160 --> 00:28:16,680
in our cultural motif of the lone wolf.

475
00:28:17,160 --> 00:28:17,993
Actually,
wolves are such pack animals that they 

476
00:28:19,501 --> 00:28:24,501
have a much wider range of expressions 
that they convey to one another in their

477
00:28:27,031 --> 00:28:30,060
interactions with one another.
And they,

478
00:28:30,061 --> 00:28:30,894
uh,
they basically will sort of engage with 

479
00:28:36,541 --> 00:28:37,374
one another and a repertoire of grimaces
and grands and showing their teeth are 

480
00:28:44,881 --> 00:28:46,170
curling their lip.
Of course,

481
00:28:46,171 --> 00:28:47,004
all sorts of body language were they 
curl their tails under a and they'll 

482
00:28:51,301 --> 00:28:56,301
drop their heads and drop her ears.
Coyotes have a similar repertoire,

483
00:28:56,311 --> 00:29:00,600
but it's a much more limited one.
And the argument that the behavioralists

484
00:29:00,601 --> 00:29:04,860
make is that that's an indication of an 
animal that's not so packed oriented.

485
00:29:05,460 --> 00:29:09,900
It's not living exclusively in a social 
group.

486
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:10,793
It can go off on its own or as a pair 
and therefore doesn't really need all 

487
00:29:15,811 --> 00:29:18,330
those facial expressions to convey 
emotion.

488
00:29:18,870 --> 00:29:22,020
So how do we know that that all these 
animals,

489
00:29:22,021 --> 00:29:22,854
all these canids evolved in North 
America and then spread out and went to 

490
00:29:26,221 --> 00:29:28,890
Asia and Africa and all these different 
places?

491
00:29:29,550 --> 00:29:31,350
Well,
that's out of the fossil record.

492
00:29:31,410 --> 00:29:33,540
Um,
and I mean there's a,

493
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:38,220
there's a good science in the fossil 
record of candidate evolution.

494
00:29:38,610 --> 00:29:39,443
As I said a bit ago.
It seems to go back to about five point 

495
00:29:43,031 --> 00:29:47,830
3 million years ago.
And all the cane is all around the world

496
00:29:47,831 --> 00:29:48,664
seem to have come out of this,
this singular origin much the way all 

497
00:29:52,751 --> 00:29:56,530
the primates of the world came out of an
origin in Africa.

498
00:29:57,130 --> 00:29:58,690
And so,
you know,

499
00:29:58,691 --> 00:30:00,100
and the horses,
for instance,

500
00:30:00,101 --> 00:30:00,934
same thing,
horses came out of an evolutionary 

501
00:30:02,561 --> 00:30:07,270
origin in North America and then spread 
across the land bridges to become zebras

502
00:30:07,271 --> 00:30:11,470
in Africa for instance.
And so that's how it happened.

503
00:30:11,471 --> 00:30:13,900
And uh,
some of these,

504
00:30:14,410 --> 00:30:15,243
these animals like jackals for example,
the golden jackals seemed to have 

505
00:30:19,961 --> 00:30:24,520
separated from the small chain Id,
the coyote,

506
00:30:24,521 --> 00:30:25,354
the line that led to coyote is about a 
million years ago and it crossed the 

507
00:30:28,961 --> 00:30:33,400
land bridge into Africa,
Southern Europe,

508
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:39,240
parts of Asia,
and became an animal that never returned

509
00:30:40,411 --> 00:30:41,244
in North America.
And because of its separation from 

510
00:30:43,601 --> 00:30:46,060
coyotes by a million years,
it became a,

511
00:30:46,180 --> 00:30:48,520
a different creature.
So crazy.

512
00:30:48,521 --> 00:30:50,350
They all did that on foot.
Yeah,

513
00:30:50,351 --> 00:30:51,650
they did it somehow know that

514
00:30:51,970 --> 00:30:55,330
the animal came from North America and 
made it all the way to Africa.

515
00:30:55,510 --> 00:30:58,210
And I want to bring something up that 
you talked about just now.

516
00:30:58,540 --> 00:31:02,920
The horses evolved in North America and 
became zebras.

517
00:31:02,950 --> 00:31:04,750
Yeah,
I mean all that started here,

518
00:31:05,110 --> 00:31:05,943
but then they weren't here anymore and 
then they were reintroduced to the 

519
00:31:09,821 --> 00:31:10,654
native Americans by the Europeans.
And what happened to the horses that 

520
00:31:13,691 --> 00:31:14,524
were here?

521
00:31:15,790 --> 00:31:16,623
Well,
that's one of the great mysteries of a 

522
00:31:19,540 --> 00:31:22,450
North American evolution,
actually,

523
00:31:22,540 --> 00:31:23,373
I,
a frank answer is we don't really know 

524
00:31:25,601 --> 00:31:27,850
what happened to them.
And so this is,

525
00:31:27,851 --> 00:31:28,930
um,
you know,

526
00:31:28,931 --> 00:31:33,931
maybe somebody out there listening,
Joe in the next 10 or 15 years,

527
00:31:35,051 --> 00:31:35,884
we'll solve it.
It will solve this problem because here 

528
00:31:39,971 --> 00:31:44,560
we have a group of animals whose 
evolutionary.

529
00:31:44,561 --> 00:31:46,930
I'm in case of the horse.
They're evolutionary origins.

530
00:31:47,230 --> 00:31:51,610
Go back 56 million years in North 
America,

531
00:31:51,611 --> 00:31:55,230
so 10 times a greater depth and time 
than,

532
00:31:55,290 --> 00:31:56,123
than the canids do.
And so they're here in all sorts of 

533
00:32:00,011 --> 00:32:01,390
forms.
Everyone has heard,

534
00:32:01,391 --> 00:32:03,470
you know,
the three toed horse,

535
00:32:03,800 --> 00:32:04,633
I'm a Eo.
Hipaa says what it's called now that 

536
00:32:09,911 --> 00:32:12,610
gradually becomes bigger and,
uh,

537
00:32:12,611 --> 00:32:13,444
it's hooves fused together and they 
become hardened because it's running 

538
00:32:17,621 --> 00:32:20,950
over rocky ground.
And so it has to have hard hooves.

539
00:32:21,340 --> 00:32:22,173
And because it begins to,
it starts as a browsing animal in the 

540
00:32:25,001 --> 00:32:28,630
forest and ultimately becomes a 
grassland animal and it's eating grasses

541
00:32:28,900 --> 00:32:31,480
that are often coated with windblown 
sand.

542
00:32:31,750 --> 00:32:32,583
So it has to evolve very strong and hard
and namel and on its teeth in order 

543
00:32:37,700 --> 00:32:40,790
resists having its being eroded down by 
San.

544
00:32:41,300 --> 00:32:46,300
It becomes ultimately by 15,
20,000 years ago,

545
00:32:46,820 --> 00:32:47,653
an animal that we would not be able to 
tell a would be any different from a 

546
00:32:53,061 --> 00:32:53,894
modern horse.
It would look exactly like a modern 

547
00:32:55,851 --> 00:32:57,470
horse,
same size.

548
00:32:57,640 --> 00:32:58,473
I mean I've seen skeletons of some of 
the horses that were in North America 

549
00:33:00,980 --> 00:33:01,813
down to about 11,000 years ago.
And even the paleontologists would have 

550
00:33:05,181 --> 00:33:06,014
a hard time telling,
which was the skeleton of a North 

551
00:33:09,410 --> 00:33:10,243
American Horse Inn,
which was the skeleton of a modern 

552
00:33:11,451 --> 00:33:12,284
domestic horse.
But these animals had had traveled 

553
00:33:15,621 --> 00:33:16,454
across the land,
bridges the bering land bridge when it 

554
00:33:18,831 --> 00:33:23,510
was open and had ended up in Asia and 
Africa and Europe where they survived.

555
00:33:24,020 --> 00:33:24,853
But for some bizarre reason,
sometime between about 10,000 years ago 

556
00:33:29,721 --> 00:33:33,140
and 8,000 years ago and North America,
they disappeared.

557
00:33:33,650 --> 00:33:34,483
They completely went extinct in North 
America and so when we Europeans 

558
00:33:41,241 --> 00:33:44,420
returned them to North America 500 years
ago,

559
00:33:44,690 --> 00:33:45,523
one of the reasons they become such a 
success and just spread across the 

560
00:33:50,541 --> 00:33:51,374
western part of the continent and 
multiply into the millions is because 

561
00:33:53,990 --> 00:33:56,780
they're already pre adapted to the 
landscape.

562
00:33:57,080 --> 00:34:00,380
This is where they had evolved.
And so they've already got the hooves.

563
00:34:00,381 --> 00:34:01,214
They've got the teeth,
they've got the running ability that he 

564
00:34:03,080 --> 00:34:03,913
got the bill to buck off predators and 
they get back here in North America and 

565
00:34:08,871 --> 00:34:09,704
within the space of about a,
after they get loose from the Pueblo 

566
00:34:13,371 --> 00:34:18,200
revolt in 1680,
within the space of about 50 to 60 or 70

567
00:34:18,201 --> 00:34:20,480
years.
They're all the way up into Canada.

568
00:34:21,020 --> 00:34:24,200
Uh,
and there are within 100 years,

569
00:34:24,260 --> 00:34:25,093
probably as many as 2 million of them 
spreading across the West reinhabiting 

570
00:34:29,751 --> 00:34:32,930
their own ecological niche.
They just fit like a glove,

571
00:34:33,230 --> 00:34:34,370
fit like a glove man.

572
00:34:34,430 --> 00:34:37,050
And um,
you know,

573
00:34:37,100 --> 00:34:37,933
and they became an.
It's a fascinating thing to kind of 

574
00:34:41,751 --> 00:34:46,751
imagine because the West 10,
15,

575
00:34:47,211 --> 00:34:52,211
25,000 years ago had been a place where 
horses had made up and some parts of the

576
00:34:53,451 --> 00:34:54,284
West as much of as a third of the 
biomass of all the grazing animals and 

577
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:06,280
in the 17 hundreds and 18 hundreds,
they were doing the same thing again.

578
00:35:07,610 --> 00:35:11,330
They were multiplying into the hundreds 
of thousands.

579
00:35:11,331 --> 00:35:12,164
The millions gradually spreading New 
Mexico is where the domestic European 

580
00:35:16,731 --> 00:35:17,564
horse got loose and began to spread and 
they had reached all the way up into 

581
00:35:21,561 --> 00:35:25,820
Montana,
Wyoming into into the edges of Canada by

582
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:27,200
18,
50,

583
00:35:27,201 --> 00:35:28,430
18,
60 or so,

584
00:35:28,431 --> 00:35:32,840
and had probably were at least two to 3 
million of them at that point.

585
00:35:32,841 --> 00:35:35,530
So they were just reinhabiting there.
Oh,

586
00:35:35,531 --> 00:35:40,531
landscape and fitting into an ecology 
now that had been dominated by bison for

587
00:35:41,491 --> 00:35:44,460
a long time and now horses are back in 
the mix.

588
00:35:44,910 --> 00:35:47,910
And horses today are very controversial 
animal.

589
00:35:47,940 --> 00:35:50,140
Wild horses are in,
you know,

590
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:53,520
people trying to think of him as an 
invasive species,

591
00:35:53,970 --> 00:35:57,390
but essentially they're just a 
reintroduce species.

592
00:35:57,480 --> 00:36:00,840
And because of that,
there's a lot of controversy on how they

593
00:36:00,841 --> 00:36:02,760
should be dealt with.
Like some people want to deal with them,

594
00:36:02,761 --> 00:36:04,650
like almost like they deal with wild 
pigs.

595
00:36:04,770 --> 00:36:05,730
Yeah,
right.

596
00:36:06,010 --> 00:36:06,930
Uh,
yeah.

597
00:36:06,931 --> 00:36:07,860
And so,
you know,

598
00:36:07,861 --> 00:36:09,450
there are plenty of people out there 
who,

599
00:36:10,530 --> 00:36:15,530
who argue that the domestic horse,
the feral horse in the west,

600
00:36:15,931 --> 00:36:20,931
which is the root stock of most of our 
population of wild horses in the West,

601
00:36:21,720 --> 00:36:22,470
um,
you know,

602
00:36:22,470 --> 00:36:23,303
is a,
essentially it's a European animal that 

603
00:36:25,290 --> 00:36:28,180
has become an invader.
Um,

604
00:36:29,370 --> 00:36:30,330
I mean,
I always,

605
00:36:30,450 --> 00:36:33,990
and I've had arguments on stage with 
people who,

606
00:36:34,140 --> 00:36:35,070
who,
uh,

607
00:36:35,310 --> 00:36:37,860
expressed this position.
I always say,

608
00:36:37,861 --> 00:36:39,990
well,
what you have to say about the horse,

609
00:36:39,991 --> 00:36:43,170
first of all is that a,
it's a,

610
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:46,080
it's an American animal with an 
asterisk.

611
00:36:46,830 --> 00:36:49,980
It's gone for about eight or 9,000 
years.

612
00:36:51,240 --> 00:36:56,240
That's actually not a huge amount of 
time in evolutionary terms.

613
00:36:57,600 --> 00:37:02,600
And even though we did domesticate them 
and began to produce some breeds,

614
00:37:03,720 --> 00:37:04,553
horses left to their own devices pretty 
quickly breed back to the wild look and 

615
00:37:09,001 --> 00:37:10,080
the wild state.
I mean,

616
00:37:10,081 --> 00:37:13,830
they'll acquire those dorsal stripes 
down their backs.

617
00:37:14,040 --> 00:37:18,510
And Zebra striping on their legs.
And so zebra striping.

618
00:37:18,540 --> 00:37:19,440
Oh yeah.
No,

619
00:37:19,441 --> 00:37:20,110
absolutely.
Well,

620
00:37:20,110 --> 00:37:20,943
is that.
There's a lot of controversy as to what 

621
00:37:22,261 --> 00:37:24,090
the Zebra striping is for.
Right?

622
00:37:24,091 --> 00:37:27,600
Is it to distract predators of the idea 
behind it?

623
00:37:27,690 --> 00:37:29,190
It may have been that,
you know,

624
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:32,130
I'm,
I'm not quite sure I can say whether the

625
00:37:32,131 --> 00:37:36,120
Zebra striping evolved for a specific,
a specific reason.

626
00:37:36,121 --> 00:37:40,680
Although most changes and animals do,
but yeah,

627
00:37:40,681 --> 00:37:45,420
they,
they will fairly readily go back to this

628
00:37:45,480 --> 00:37:46,313
early wild horse look,
which is probably what horses looked 

629
00:37:49,801 --> 00:37:51,870
like in North America 10,000 years ago.

630
00:37:52,080 --> 00:37:55,440
See if you can find some pictures of 
like wild horses with Zebra stripes.

631
00:37:55,441 --> 00:37:56,450
I don't think I've ever seen it.
Look,

632
00:37:56,580 --> 00:37:57,580
look,
that's fascinating.

633
00:37:57,581 --> 00:37:59,900
Yeah.
Look in the Pryor Mountains,

634
00:37:59,910 --> 00:38:00,743
wild horse range in Montana and you'll 
see a whole population of animals that 

635
00:38:05,490 --> 00:38:07,740
come out of that,
that background.

636
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:08,593
They have a very interesting history 
because it was a group of animals that 

637
00:38:12,390 --> 00:38:16,290
Lewis and Clark acquired from the 
Indians and they were going to take back

638
00:38:16,770 --> 00:38:19,820
and trade in the Mandan villages,
uh,

639
00:38:19,890 --> 00:38:22,170
and a guy named,
uh,

640
00:38:22,230 --> 00:38:23,063
prior who was responsible for the herd,
was driving them through the today's 

641
00:38:27,121 --> 00:38:27,954
pryor mountains and the crow Indians 
raided his camp and chased off a bunch 

642
00:38:31,681 --> 00:38:34,590
of those horses and they're now in those
mountains and they,

643
00:38:35,980 --> 00:38:36,813
this early,
sort of a dorsal back striped zebra leg 

644
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:48,000
look that probably came right from the 
Spanish horses of New Mexico.

645
00:38:48,380 --> 00:38:48,840
Wow.

646
00:38:48,840 --> 00:38:51,220
Uh,
up into the northern West.

647
00:38:51,460 --> 00:38:52,540
So the,
whatever,

648
00:38:52,541 --> 00:38:53,374
the mass extinction event that took 
place somewhere in the neighborhood of 

649
00:38:56,111 --> 00:38:58,510
10,000 years ago that claimed the wooly 
mammoth,

650
00:38:58,840 --> 00:39:01,000
saber tooth tiger,
all these different animals.

651
00:39:01,001 --> 00:39:01,834
The horse was amongst that as well,
is that the horse was one of the ones 

652
00:39:04,151 --> 00:39:05,560
that disappeared.
Yeah.

653
00:39:05,590 --> 00:39:06,423
And,
uh,

654
00:39:07,210 --> 00:39:08,290
you know,
so I mean,

655
00:39:08,291 --> 00:39:12,370
we've got some pretty good explanations 
for what happened to the mammoths.

656
00:39:12,460 --> 00:39:13,293
You know,
the mammas probably a were taken out by 

657
00:39:16,811 --> 00:39:17,644
human hunters because this,
this was a version of the American west 

658
00:39:21,580 --> 00:39:22,413
that,
that basically had emerged in the 

659
00:39:25,751 --> 00:39:27,780
absence of people,
you know,

660
00:39:27,850 --> 00:39:30,700
and we're just like every other mammal 
that you mentioned a minute ago.

661
00:39:30,701 --> 00:39:31,534
You were amazed at the fact that the 
wolves were able to spread around the 

662
00:39:33,851 --> 00:39:36,100
world and the horses were able to spread
around the world.

663
00:39:36,101 --> 00:39:37,150
Well,
we did the same thing.

664
00:39:37,150 --> 00:39:37,983
We started in Africa and we spread 
around the world getting the Europe 

665
00:39:41,320 --> 00:39:46,120
about 45,000 years ago and didn't get to
North America,

666
00:39:46,121 --> 00:39:46,954
which was one of the last places except 
for the islands out in the Pacific that 

667
00:39:50,201 --> 00:39:53,680
humans got to until about 15,000 years 
ago.

668
00:39:54,160 --> 00:39:54,993
And so when we arrive,
we confronted a landscape that was full 

669
00:40:00,101 --> 00:40:00,934
of animals,
like mammoths that had no experience 

670
00:40:05,141 --> 00:40:05,974
with human hunters at all.
And what we think is that these early 

671
00:40:09,341 --> 00:40:12,080
arrivals from Siberia,
uh,

672
00:40:12,100 --> 00:40:15,490
we're probably really accomplished big 
game hunters.

673
00:40:15,940 --> 00:40:17,980
And I mean,
like all elephants,

674
00:40:17,981 --> 00:40:20,920
mammas had really long gestation 
periods.

675
00:40:20,921 --> 00:40:24,160
It took them once they were impregnated,
took them two years to have a calf.

676
00:40:24,670 --> 00:40:25,503
Wow.
And so they have a really to pregnant 

677
00:40:26,921 --> 00:40:27,700
for two years.
Yeah,

678
00:40:27,700 --> 00:40:28,533
they're pregnant for two years and so 
they have a really low population 

679
00:40:31,961 --> 00:40:32,794
recovery ability,
a biologist call this a case species 

680
00:40:36,971 --> 00:40:39,820
that have a kind of a low reproductive 
rate.

681
00:40:39,970 --> 00:40:43,510
And so whenever humans arrive and you 
know,

682
00:40:43,511 --> 00:40:48,490
and we take a look at the situation,
and I mean cow mammoths evidently were a

683
00:40:48,491 --> 00:40:53,200
lot easier to deal with in a hunt then 
the big bulls were.

684
00:40:53,560 --> 00:40:56,860
And so these hunter seemed to have 
concentrated on cows.

685
00:40:57,610 --> 00:41:02,610
I mean that's of course obviously going 
to be detrimental to the demographics of

686
00:41:02,831 --> 00:41:07,100
the population.
And so probably in the case of mammoths,

687
00:41:07,120 --> 00:41:07,953
it was human hunting of an animal that 
had no prior experience with human 

688
00:41:12,371 --> 00:41:13,204
hunters then.
And not very many defenses against us 

689
00:41:14,951 --> 00:41:15,784
that took them out.
The other animals that have a lot of 

690
00:41:17,981 --> 00:41:18,814
them,
I mean some of the predators we think 

691
00:41:19,661 --> 00:41:23,140
they went because of their prey species 
disappeared.

692
00:41:23,470 --> 00:41:24,303
But I mean,
the amazing thing with the horses is 

693
00:41:27,311 --> 00:41:31,840
just hard to fathom because we haven't 
found very many sites.

694
00:41:31,841 --> 00:41:36,841
There was one recently near Boulder,
Colorado of what appeared to be on early

695
00:41:37,370 --> 00:41:39,680
Indian kill of horses.

696
00:41:40,430 --> 00:41:41,263
But you know,
if you tried to argue that the same 

697
00:41:42,891 --> 00:41:45,860
thing happened with horses that happen 
with the Mammas,

698
00:41:45,861 --> 00:41:49,270
she'd think you'd be finding kill sites 
all over the place.

699
00:41:49,620 --> 00:41:52,910
It's not really found them.
Have you ever looked into as this one of

700
00:41:52,911 --> 00:41:53,744
the animals?
So it's got the front paws got a little 

701
00:41:55,191 --> 00:41:57,350
bit of zero strikes her front legs 
rather.

702
00:41:57,380 --> 00:41:59,030
But you,
you're saying it's the back legs?

703
00:41:59,060 --> 00:41:59,780
Well,
it's both,

704
00:41:59,780 --> 00:42:01,370
so I'll look at that.
Wow,

705
00:42:01,371 --> 00:42:02,630
that's fascinating.
Yeah.

706
00:42:02,670 --> 00:42:04,760
They had the zebra stripes on the legs 
and.

707
00:42:05,090 --> 00:42:07,670
Oh Wow.
That is wild.

708
00:42:07,790 --> 00:42:11,370
And they have this black stripe down the
back.

709
00:42:11,930 --> 00:42:13,810
The dorsal stripe is king.
So yeah.

710
00:42:14,080 --> 00:42:14,913
Well,
I've read something about zebras that 

711
00:42:18,050 --> 00:42:19,130
they're,
um,

712
00:42:19,310 --> 00:42:20,143
that it makes it very hard for predators
to differentiate between individual 

713
00:42:23,291 --> 00:42:24,124
zebras and that they had put an ear 
collar or clip on one of the zebras and 

714
00:42:28,910 --> 00:42:33,110
immediately that Zebra was taken out and
they had singled that zebra out.

715
00:42:33,110 --> 00:42:35,210
It was very obvious to the predators 
that,

716
00:42:35,211 --> 00:42:37,100
that was an individual and they went 
right after it.

717
00:42:37,730 --> 00:42:38,481
Yeah.
Well,

718
00:42:38,481 --> 00:42:39,314
it could be something like that.
And I mean it's pretty clear from the 

719
00:42:44,300 --> 00:42:45,133
North American horses that the Zebra 
striping trait originated here and then 

720
00:42:52,580 --> 00:42:53,413
ended up being taken by the animals that
migrated into Africa and perhaps 

721
00:42:59,451 --> 00:43:02,270
elaborated on over time where they're 
dealing with,

722
00:43:02,900 --> 00:43:07,070
with lions and Cheetahs and leopards and
things like that.

723
00:43:07,220 --> 00:43:09,820
And they handled lion in North America.
Yeah.

724
00:43:09,830 --> 00:43:12,160
We had lauren time that was even bigger 
than the African lions,

725
00:43:12,230 --> 00:43:13,220
right.
Panthera,

726
00:43:13,221 --> 00:43:17,780
the step line was a line that was one 
and a half times the size of,

727
00:43:18,440 --> 00:43:20,330
of the African Lion.
And we had a,

728
00:43:20,750 --> 00:43:24,620
you know,
a short face bear that was probably even

729
00:43:24,621 --> 00:43:28,370
more ferocious than modern day grizzlies
for one thing.

730
00:43:28,371 --> 00:43:31,670
It seems to have been a this really 
gracile animal.

731
00:43:31,671 --> 00:43:36,671
It looked far more nimble and fast and 
its ability to run and so forth.

732
00:43:38,700 --> 00:43:40,190
Then Grizzlies do.
Yeah.

733
00:43:40,191 --> 00:43:41,024
We've talked about that thing many times
since I heard you talk about and we 

734
00:43:43,010 --> 00:43:46,640
pulled up pictures of it and the size of
the things and the length of the legs.

735
00:43:46,641 --> 00:43:47,474
Yeah,
and I looked at.

736
00:43:48,140 --> 00:43:52,190
It's a huge animal that's a huge animal,
was bigger than a polar bear,

737
00:43:52,250 --> 00:43:53,420
so I.
there's A.

738
00:43:53,420 --> 00:43:57,890
There's a Canadian biologist named 
hilarious guys who has argued for a long

739
00:43:57,891 --> 00:44:02,300
time that he thinks until short faced 
bears became extinct.

740
00:44:03,080 --> 00:44:06,950
Humans were not able to actually 
colonized North America,

741
00:44:07,430 --> 00:44:08,263
that those things were so fearsome that 
they basically kept Siberian hunters at 

742
00:44:13,161 --> 00:44:13,994
bay on the other side of the bering land
bridge and finally when they began to 

743
00:44:18,231 --> 00:44:19,064
disappear,
then people begin trekking across and 

744
00:44:21,741 --> 00:44:23,720
getting it in North America.
Wow.

745
00:44:24,260 --> 00:44:25,520
Well,
they look like a monster.

746
00:44:25,670 --> 00:44:27,740
I mean,
it doesn't even look like a real animal.

747
00:44:27,741 --> 00:44:28,574
It looks like something in a movie and 
then you see the short face and what is 

748
00:44:31,621 --> 00:44:32,454
that next

749
00:44:32,520 --> 00:44:33,600
day it.
How do you say that?

750
00:44:34,250 --> 00:44:35,260
Don Dale.
Don,

751
00:44:35,990 --> 00:44:38,340
that's what do they call that?
The hell pig?

752
00:44:38,410 --> 00:44:40,110
Yeah,
that's a,

753
00:44:40,170 --> 00:44:42,000
an animal even bigger than the short 
face bear.

754
00:44:42,001 --> 00:44:44,460
So all these animals that existed in 
North America,

755
00:44:44,461 --> 00:44:47,730
when did the short face bear go extinct?
The size of that thing.

756
00:44:48,210 --> 00:44:49,590
That's terrifying.
Yeah.

757
00:44:49,591 --> 00:44:51,390
I think probably about,
uh,

758
00:44:51,660 --> 00:44:56,010
about 14,000,
15,000 years ago and as I said,

759
00:44:56,490 --> 00:44:57,323
at least one biologist argues that it's 
no coincidence that that's about the 

760
00:45:00,961 --> 00:45:04,730
time that humans began showing up is 
that once this bear is,

761
00:45:04,810 --> 00:45:05,643
has gone,
then it makes it possible for people to 

762
00:45:07,860 --> 00:45:10,840
come into North America because they're 
a hypothesis as to why that went extinct

763
00:45:10,841 --> 00:45:13,060
because of human intervention as well.
Now,

764
00:45:13,061 --> 00:45:14,640
you know,
I think what's happening,

765
00:45:14,700 --> 00:45:15,910
uh,
in,

766
00:45:15,950 --> 00:45:19,170
uh,
there's a bunch of pretty wild swings in

767
00:45:19,171 --> 00:45:20,940
climate,
uh,

768
00:45:22,050 --> 00:45:22,883
as a result of the,
the steady progression of ice ages and 

769
00:45:28,591 --> 00:45:30,130
then water called,
uh,

770
00:45:30,330 --> 00:45:31,163
the Inter pluvial in between the ice 
ages and the reason we think we have 

771
00:45:37,410 --> 00:45:38,243
sort of a steady record of ice ages and 
then a warming period in between and 

772
00:45:43,441 --> 00:45:44,970
then a return to ice ages.

773
00:45:44,970 --> 00:45:45,803
And warming,
and that goes back on the record for a 

774
00:45:47,071 --> 00:45:47,904
very long time,
is that the earth actually doesn't spin 

775
00:45:52,490 --> 00:45:56,430
a and a true,
perfect spin on its axis.

776
00:45:56,431 --> 00:46:01,080
It has a wobble in it and sometimes when
it wobbles,

777
00:46:01,440 --> 00:46:04,170
this is called a procession of the 
equinoxes.

778
00:46:04,440 --> 00:46:05,480
Well,
it's called the,

779
00:46:05,560 --> 00:46:08,850
uh,
the milankovitch cycles of a European.

780
00:46:09,490 --> 00:46:12,510
Uh,
I can't remember if he was a geographer,

781
00:46:12,930 --> 00:46:13,763
probably a geographer was the first to 
speculate that this is why we have this 

782
00:46:18,121 --> 00:46:23,100
climate history of a procession between 
ice ages and pluvial is in between,

783
00:46:23,400 --> 00:46:26,970
is because the earth wobbles and as it 
wobbles,

784
00:46:27,330 --> 00:46:28,163
it will at certain times position the 
northern hemisphere farther away from 

785
00:46:32,731 --> 00:46:36,240
the sun for a period of 30,
40,000 years.

786
00:46:36,480 --> 00:46:40,470
And during that wobble and that 
position,

787
00:46:40,830 --> 00:46:42,660
you get a,
an ice age.

788
00:46:42,780 --> 00:46:43,613
And then the wobble,
we'll take it back so that the northern 

789
00:46:46,381 --> 00:46:48,690
hemisphere begins to point more directly
at the sun.

790
00:46:48,690 --> 00:46:51,010
And in between you get what are called 
[inaudible].

791
00:46:51,620 --> 00:46:54,540
Uh,
sometimes quite warm episodes.

792
00:46:54,541 --> 00:46:56,430
I mean,
we had one about 5,000 years ago.

793
00:46:56,431 --> 00:46:59,640
That was probably six or seven or eight 
degrees warmer than today.

794
00:46:59,970 --> 00:47:04,110
I would love to get you together with a 
guy named Randall Carlson,

795
00:47:04,140 --> 00:47:04,973
who's an expert in astro asteroidal 
impacts and he's got some pretty 

796
00:47:09,030 --> 00:47:09,863
compelling evidence and some fascinating
theories about the end of the ice age 

797
00:47:14,160 --> 00:47:14,993
and at the end of the ice age 
corresponds to a lot of nuclear glass 

798
00:47:17,971 --> 00:47:18,804
sites in Asia and Europe that the 
nuclear glasses as essentially the same 

799
00:47:22,831 --> 00:47:24,870
stuff they find doing.
They do nuclear test sites.

800
00:47:24,871 --> 00:47:25,704
That also happens when they have media 
impacts and it's all throughout and 

801
00:47:29,711 --> 00:47:30,220
Europe

802
00:47:30,220 --> 00:47:33,460
and he believes there was a significant 
impact in North America.

803
00:47:33,461 --> 00:47:38,461
Not once but twice and it directly 
corresponds to our,

804
00:47:38,610 --> 00:47:42,520
a planet passing through a essentially a
comet storm.

805
00:47:43,090 --> 00:47:45,670
Really fascinating stuff,
but he's got this.

806
00:47:45,700 --> 00:47:46,533
Actually,
I would love to get you together with 

807
00:47:47,561 --> 00:47:51,070
him because he's got some compelling 
evidence that he believes that the wooly

808
00:47:51,071 --> 00:47:52,600
mammoths and the,
what was it,

809
00:47:52,601 --> 00:47:53,434
60 something percent of the large 
mammals that died off during that very 

810
00:47:57,101 --> 00:47:57,934
distinct time period.
He says that directly corresponds to 

811
00:48:00,131 --> 00:48:03,580
physical evidence of this trite night 
stuff and all these,

812
00:48:03,581 --> 00:48:04,414
uh,
diamonds that they find micro diamonds 

813
00:48:06,131 --> 00:48:08,110
that come from these impacts.
Very fascinating.

814
00:48:08,480 --> 00:48:11,320
It is a possibility that you have 
considered

815
00:48:11,350 --> 00:48:12,220
no.
Well,

816
00:48:12,221 --> 00:48:14,260
I mean I've read about it and I think,
you know,

817
00:48:14,261 --> 00:48:16,960
as in so many questions out there,
you know,

818
00:48:17,010 --> 00:48:20,980
we haven't figured out the answers to 
things and a lot of instances.

819
00:48:21,010 --> 00:48:23,380
And so yeah,
this is a possibility.

820
00:48:23,410 --> 00:48:24,243
I mean,
what I was sort of leading to by 

821
00:48:27,130 --> 00:48:27,963
tracking that milankovitch cycle,
a procession through time is that that 

822
00:48:34,421 --> 00:48:35,254
sort of changed tends to produce among 
animal species and plants to really a 

823
00:48:40,961 --> 00:48:43,570
lot of speciation.
In other words,

824
00:48:43,571 --> 00:48:44,404
it generates a lot of new because you're
often isolating populations and when 

825
00:48:49,120 --> 00:48:51,670
populations get isolated from their 
parent populations,

826
00:48:51,671 --> 00:48:55,510
they'll evolve some new traits and maybe
even become a new species.

827
00:48:55,810 --> 00:48:56,643
And so you get a lot.
It's kind of a cycle where you end up 

828
00:49:00,311 --> 00:49:05,020
with a lot of different new animals.
But when change comes,

829
00:49:05,200 --> 00:49:08,590
you often lose a good many of them.
And so,

830
00:49:09,310 --> 00:49:10,143
uh,
these extinctions scenarios that are 

831
00:49:12,401 --> 00:49:13,234
associated with the ice ages and the 
[inaudible] in between the 

832
00:49:16,811 --> 00:49:18,790
interglacials,
uh,

833
00:49:19,270 --> 00:49:24,070
do tend to produce quite a number of 
extinctions.

834
00:49:24,430 --> 00:49:29,430
And the short face bear,
I mean I wish I was more of an expert so

835
00:49:29,441 --> 00:49:32,620
I could directly address exactly what 
happened to it.

836
00:49:32,621 --> 00:49:37,621
But all I can tell you from my limited 
knowledge of it is that it seems to have

837
00:49:37,721 --> 00:49:40,900
disappeared in North America around 
15,000 years ago.

838
00:49:40,960 --> 00:49:45,960
And that's at a time when the Wisconsin 
ice age is beginning to wind down.

839
00:49:46,980 --> 00:49:48,820
Um,
and so,

840
00:49:49,240 --> 00:49:50,530
you know,
we still haven't.

841
00:49:50,590 --> 00:49:52,000
I mean,
there are a lot of scholars out there,

842
00:49:52,001 --> 00:49:52,834
a lot of people out there who are 
arguing climate as the primary 

843
00:49:56,860 --> 00:49:59,800
explanation for the Pleistocene 
extinctions.

844
00:50:00,370 --> 00:50:02,710
Most people sort of concede that,
okay,

845
00:50:02,711 --> 00:50:03,544
in the case of the mammoths are evidence
tends to point more towards human 

846
00:50:08,081 --> 00:50:08,914
hunting,
but we don't know about all these other 

847
00:50:11,261 --> 00:50:12,880
animals.
You know why?

848
00:50:13,150 --> 00:50:14,680
I mean the predators,
as I said,

849
00:50:14,681 --> 00:50:17,710
they seem to disappear because of the 
prey disappears.

850
00:50:17,711 --> 00:50:20,080
But I mean one of the camels 
disappeared.

851
00:50:20,081 --> 00:50:21,940
One of the,
the,

852
00:50:21,970 --> 00:50:25,480
you know,
these giant ground sloths disappear when

853
00:50:25,840 --> 00:50:26,673
the things that they ate.
The Globe mallows that are still in the 

854
00:50:29,931 --> 00:50:30,764
West are still out there.
But the animal that fed on them isn't 

855
00:50:33,951 --> 00:50:37,190
there anymore,
so it's something,

856
00:50:37,220 --> 00:50:38,053
you know,
that people have been sort of a 

857
00:50:40,130 --> 00:50:40,963
hammering around over beers and in 
laboratories for actually more than a 

858
00:50:46,010 --> 00:50:46,843
century now.
And we still haven't answered all the 

859
00:50:48,130 --> 00:50:49,080
questions.
It is

860
00:50:49,330 --> 00:50:50,163
fascinating,
but it's so amazing that you could even 

861
00:50:51,641 --> 00:50:55,330
formulate that much information based on
something that was 25,

862
00:50:55,331 --> 00:50:57,220
15,000 years ago.
It is,

863
00:50:57,280 --> 00:50:59,310
I mean,
this whole country that we,

864
00:50:59,460 --> 00:51:04,210
we live in today was for,
as far as Europeans are concerned,

865
00:51:04,211 --> 00:51:05,650
we've only been here a few hundred 
years,

866
00:51:05,651 --> 00:51:06,484
which is really kind of amazing.
I've only been here for a few hundred 

867
00:51:08,860 --> 00:51:09,250
years,
you know,

868
00:51:09,250 --> 00:51:10,083
and uh,

869
00:51:10,540 --> 00:51:11,770
I mean,
as you know from,

870
00:51:11,830 --> 00:51:12,790
from the,
uh,

871
00:51:12,791 --> 00:51:16,270
the other recent book of mine,
American Serengeti,

872
00:51:16,470 --> 00:51:17,303
uh,
one of the animals that you can observe 

873
00:51:21,521 --> 00:51:22,354
today that gives us maybe our best sense
of what the Pleistocene is light is the 

874
00:51:26,741 --> 00:51:30,940
pronghorn antelope,
which is still out on the plains.

875
00:51:30,941 --> 00:51:31,774
And of course across a lot of the west,
I mean natural where they nearly 

876
00:51:34,001 --> 00:51:36,550
disappeared at the turn of the 20th 
century.

877
00:51:36,551 --> 00:51:39,220
We've managed to bring them back and a 
lot of western states,

878
00:51:39,221 --> 00:51:40,054
but that's an animal that is essentially
a holdover from the pleistocene and is 

879
00:51:46,781 --> 00:51:51,550
kind of still fighting pleistocene 
ghosts.

880
00:51:51,670 --> 00:51:52,503
I mean,
it's an animal is everybody knows that 

881
00:51:54,191 --> 00:51:58,750
can run 65 miles an hour and yet for the
last 10,000 years,

882
00:51:59,320 --> 00:52:00,153
the fastest animal that can chase it.
The Gray Wolf only runs 45 miles an 

883
00:52:04,541 --> 00:52:05,374
hour.
And so that leads to the obvious 

884
00:52:07,271 --> 00:52:12,100
question why the overkill in terms of 
speed,

885
00:52:12,101 --> 00:52:12,934
what you would think is all you need to 
do is run 47 miles an hour and you got 

886
00:52:17,291 --> 00:52:18,124
it covered.

887
00:52:18,370 --> 00:52:21,850
But here are these animals still among 
us that runs 65 miles an hour,

888
00:52:22,090 --> 00:52:26,550
that can't jump over fences that still 
congregate and what,

889
00:52:26,640 --> 00:52:27,473
uh,
what people call the selfish herd where 

890
00:52:30,041 --> 00:52:30,874
they'll group up as a herd of adults and
the dominant animals will end up in the 

891
00:52:34,841 --> 00:52:37,480
middle so that if there are any 
predators,

892
00:52:37,660 --> 00:52:42,280
they get the ones on the edges and the 
dominant ones survive.

893
00:52:43,120 --> 00:52:48,120
And yet they don't have any predators 
except as fons.

894
00:52:49,240 --> 00:52:50,073
And so what we think is happening is 
that in the pronghorn we've got an 

895
00:52:55,181 --> 00:52:56,014
animal that has survived in our own time
that preserves how evolution shaped it 

896
00:53:06,670 --> 00:53:09,970
to deal with the predators of the 
Pleistocene,

897
00:53:10,420 --> 00:53:11,253
when there actually was a cheetah and a 
running hyena that could run almost 65 

898
00:53:17,591 --> 00:53:18,424
miles an hour and there were predators 
that went after their herds when they 

899
00:53:23,471 --> 00:53:27,450
were adults,
and all those animals have disappeared.

900
00:53:27,480 --> 00:53:28,313
They're all ghosts and have been for 
10,000 years and yet pronghorn still 

901
00:53:32,701 --> 00:53:33,534
preserve the ability to run away from a 
Cheetah and two group up as a selfish 

902
00:53:38,401 --> 00:53:42,480
herd and preserve the dominant animals 
in the middle against the hyena attack.

903
00:53:42,690 --> 00:53:46,290
I had no idea they could run that fast.
They can run 65 miles an hour.

904
00:53:46,350 --> 00:53:47,183
I only think some of the females which 
are a little bit lighter than the males 

905
00:53:51,751 --> 00:53:56,500
are.
Some of them may be able to run 70 magic

906
00:53:57,550 --> 00:53:59,150
going on the highway.
You're.

907
00:53:59,200 --> 00:54:02,520
You're violating the speed limit.
And a pronghorn process is.

908
00:54:02,540 --> 00:54:03,373
Yes,
that's right.

909
00:54:05,220 --> 00:54:06,053
That's incredible.
I did not know that there was hyenas 

910
00:54:08,220 --> 00:54:11,160
that lived in North America as well that
could run that fast.

911
00:54:11,161 --> 00:54:12,330
Yeah.
We had a fast,

912
00:54:12,430 --> 00:54:15,620
a running hyena that,
uh,

913
00:54:15,750 --> 00:54:18,900
was a major Predator of creatures like 
this,

914
00:54:18,930 --> 00:54:19,501
you know,
I mean,

915
00:54:19,501 --> 00:54:21,030
if you think about it,
what you know,

916
00:54:21,120 --> 00:54:24,690
and this is why I use the term American 
Serengeti for the title of this book,

917
00:54:25,020 --> 00:54:29,910
what we had in North America where these
versions.

918
00:54:30,420 --> 00:54:30,931
Yeah.
On the.

919
00:54:30,931 --> 00:54:31,350
Yeah.
Look,

920
00:54:31,350 --> 00:54:32,183
we've got a video of them right now and 
just someone's driving in the car and 

921
00:54:35,101 --> 00:54:37,810
they are just flying by.
Yeah.

922
00:54:37,900 --> 00:54:40,380
Merriweather Lewis famously said 
they're,

923
00:54:40,890 --> 00:54:41,723
they're running motion more resembles 
the flight of birds than it does any 

924
00:54:46,170 --> 00:54:47,040
mammal.
Yeah,

925
00:54:47,041 --> 00:54:47,874
I've seen them.
I saw them in Montana and boy did they 

926
00:54:49,741 --> 00:54:52,230
book.
It's Kinda crazy to watch in real life.

927
00:54:52,830 --> 00:54:54,870
We'll see him take off when they get 
spooked and you're like,

928
00:54:54,900 --> 00:54:57,060
whoa.
There are version of,

929
00:54:57,110 --> 00:55:00,270
you know,
impalas and gazelles and in Africa.

930
00:55:00,780 --> 00:55:04,380
And so what other aunt there was this 
Cheetah now?

931
00:55:04,650 --> 00:55:06,900
Is it,
does it resemble the African Cheetah?

932
00:55:06,901 --> 00:55:08,790
Was it?
Did it looked like an African Cheetah?

933
00:55:09,390 --> 00:55:10,440
It,
it did.

934
00:55:10,441 --> 00:55:11,570
Resemble it,
uh,

935
00:55:11,650 --> 00:55:14,220
as a result of kind of convergent 
evolution.

936
00:55:14,221 --> 00:55:14,601
I mean,
it,

937
00:55:14,601 --> 00:55:15,434
it was an animal that pursued these 
pronghorns that could run 70 miles an 

938
00:55:20,551 --> 00:55:23,220
hour.
So it had to be able to run that fast.

939
00:55:23,250 --> 00:55:25,530
Did it develop independently of the 
African Cheetah?

940
00:55:25,590 --> 00:55:26,423
It did end date.
And in fact it developed from the 

941
00:55:29,430 --> 00:55:32,370
Cougar,
the mountain lion line.

942
00:55:32,880 --> 00:55:36,670
So it doesn't come out of,
you know,

943
00:55:36,700 --> 00:55:37,533
I mean the,
the Cheetah is a cat that famously many 

944
00:55:41,101 --> 00:55:44,060
people say it.
It's a dog gleick cat,

945
00:55:44,760 --> 00:55:45,593
uh,
and it's,

946
00:55:45,600 --> 00:55:50,600
its own independent entity in Africa.
And so our version of it came out of the

947
00:55:53,341 --> 00:55:58,341
same line that produced mountain lions 
except Mountain Lions 15,000,

948
00:55:59,461 --> 00:56:00,294
20,000 years ago.
Produced this very fast running version 

949
00:56:04,470 --> 00:56:07,890
that was in effect an American Cheetah.
Wow.

950
00:56:08,100 --> 00:56:11,520
And did it have the same sort of front 
paws as a cheetah?

951
00:56:11,550 --> 00:56:13,380
Cause Cheetah's,
they're more,

952
00:56:13,440 --> 00:56:15,660
almost dogleg this,
this,

953
00:56:15,720 --> 00:56:19,830
this North American animal didn't have 
dog like pads,

954
00:56:19,831 --> 00:56:23,140
like the African Cheetah does a,
at least I'm not,

955
00:56:23,170 --> 00:56:24,003
you know,
there may be some cheetah are our North 

956
00:56:25,840 --> 00:56:26,950
American cheese expert out there who 
would,

957
00:56:27,480 --> 00:56:29,560
who would contest that.
But I don't think so.

958
00:56:29,590 --> 00:56:32,650
I've not seen any evidence anywhere in 
anything I've read that it did.

959
00:56:32,740 --> 00:56:34,070
So it essentially just develop

960
00:56:34,120 --> 00:56:36,670
disability to run very fast,
to catch pronghorn

961
00:56:36,750 --> 00:56:39,060
to catch pronghorns and catch,
you know.

962
00:56:39,061 --> 00:56:41,010
And there were,
there were other animals that could run,

963
00:56:41,040 --> 00:56:43,080
I mean,
horses run pretty fast,

964
00:56:43,081 --> 00:56:44,350
so,
uh,

965
00:56:44,370 --> 00:56:47,580
and cats,
I mean the reason horses buck of course,

966
00:56:47,700 --> 00:56:52,390
which we translated in our own time into
Rodeo sports,

967
00:56:53,220 --> 00:56:54,053
but the reason they buck is because 
that's their strategy for dislodging a 

968
00:56:58,711 --> 00:57:03,711
cat attack.
They were always a pray of cats.

969
00:57:04,530 --> 00:57:06,480
And so,
you know,

970
00:57:06,481 --> 00:57:07,201
and so,
I mean,

971
00:57:07,201 --> 00:57:08,970
when we were talking about horses a 
minute ago,

972
00:57:08,971 --> 00:57:10,470
I mean,
one of the points I was going to make,

973
00:57:10,471 --> 00:57:11,304
and I can make this point too,
is that one of the reasons horses 

974
00:57:14,071 --> 00:57:16,950
reasons,
horses are an issue now.

975
00:57:16,980 --> 00:57:21,980
And a problem in the West is a,
they're not on the great plains anymore,

976
00:57:23,730 --> 00:57:28,730
which was the primary horse range during
the 17 hundreds and 18 hundreds there in

977
00:57:30,991 --> 00:57:33,780
the deserts of places like Nevada.

978
00:57:34,950 --> 00:57:37,560
Uh,
so they're in a much more arid country,

979
00:57:37,561 --> 00:57:40,690
not in a lushly grass plains setting,
but in a,

980
00:57:40,691 --> 00:57:45,660
in a desert setting,
and we don't have their predators around

981
00:57:45,870 --> 00:57:47,120
anymore.
I mean,

982
00:57:47,270 --> 00:57:51,810
we've taken out gray wolves,
which certainly did pray on colts.

983
00:57:52,380 --> 00:57:53,213
We've almost wiped out mountain lions.
They're meant lines are coming back and 

984
00:57:57,211 --> 00:58:00,960
that's was always one of the major 
predators of cults,

985
00:58:01,620 --> 00:58:02,453
but horses don't have the sort of 
predators anymore that they had during 

986
00:58:06,691 --> 00:58:11,370
the pleistocene or even in the 17 
hundreds and 18 hundreds.

987
00:58:11,700 --> 00:58:16,650
And so without their predators on the 
landscape and also being out in a desert

988
00:58:16,651 --> 00:58:20,280
setting rather than out in the much 
lusher great plains.

989
00:58:20,281 --> 00:58:21,300
They,
you know,

990
00:58:21,301 --> 00:58:26,301
they've become an issue in terms of uh,
how they compete with cattle,

991
00:58:27,180 --> 00:58:28,013
how they compete with sheep,
how they compete with mule deer and 

992
00:58:30,481 --> 00:58:33,450
wildlife.
And that's why we were sort of endlessly

993
00:58:33,451 --> 00:58:35,910
rattling the cage around wild horses 
now.

994
00:58:36,570 --> 00:58:40,710
But in the 19th century,
in the 18 hundreds,

995
00:58:40,711 --> 00:58:44,520
I mean,
were they were out on the great plains.

996
00:58:44,521 --> 00:58:45,354
They were in eastern Montana and eastern
Colorado and eastern New Mexico in this 

997
00:58:49,741 --> 00:58:52,750
much more lushly grasp setting.
And they're,

998
00:58:52,780 --> 00:58:53,613
of course still were wolves and mountain
lions to take out the colts and sort of 

999
00:58:57,660 --> 00:58:59,490
keep their population suppressed them,

1000
00:59:00,060 --> 00:59:01,080
it seems,
you know,

1001
00:59:01,110 --> 00:59:01,943
I mean,
I'm incredulous that human beings that 

1002
00:59:03,721 --> 00:59:06,120
didn't even have bows and arrows could 
kill off the woolly mammoth.

1003
00:59:06,121 --> 00:59:10,380
But then you stop and think about what 
people are able to do in the few hundred

1004
00:59:10,380 --> 00:59:13,410
years that we've been here when we 
arrived in North America,

1005
00:59:13,440 --> 00:59:14,273
when Europeans arrived in North America 
and just essentially swept through the 

1006
00:59:16,921 --> 00:59:20,970
country and almost extra painted 
everything.

1007
00:59:21,110 --> 00:59:22,410
Found like white

1008
00:59:22,410 --> 00:59:24,080
tail deer,
antelope,

1009
00:59:24,110 --> 00:59:24,943
Buffalo.
We almost wiped the whole thing of elk 

1010
00:59:27,890 --> 00:59:30,230
when we got it down to just,
I mean,

1011
00:59:30,231 --> 00:59:33,230
at the turn of the 19th century or the 
20th century,

1012
00:59:33,231 --> 00:59:34,730
rather we.
It was a,

1013
00:59:34,820 --> 00:59:38,210
it was a sad state and it was a sad 
state and it was a,

1014
00:59:39,080 --> 00:59:39,913
you know,
it's one of those instances in history 

1015
00:59:41,301 --> 00:59:42,620
where a.
I mean,

1016
00:59:42,621 --> 00:59:45,740
I think I say this in the introduction 
of that American Serengeti Book,

1017
00:59:46,240 --> 00:59:51,240
that that was the largest destruction of
wildlife that I've been able to discover

1018
00:59:54,380 --> 00:59:59,380
in world history when Europeans came to 
North America and proceeded,

1019
00:59:59,421 --> 01:00:00,254
as you've just described from the 
Atlantic seaboard to the Pacific and 

1020
01:00:05,060 --> 01:00:10,060
essentially wiped out just dozens of 
animal species in most instances.

1021
01:00:13,161 --> 01:00:13,994
Not completely a exterminating them,
but dropping them to numbers that were 

1022
01:00:19,821 --> 01:00:20,654
so low that you know,
you worried that this animal was gonna 

1023
01:00:24,860 --> 01:00:26,510
survive and I mean some animals.

1024
01:00:26,510 --> 01:00:29,330
We did go extinct.
The Carolina parakeet,

1025
01:00:29,331 --> 01:00:31,040
for example,
a,

1026
01:00:31,070 --> 01:00:36,070
was this beautiful Gadi Green and 
yellow,

1027
01:00:36,680 --> 01:00:37,513
large cro sized parrot that was in North
America all the way up to the great 

1028
01:00:42,231 --> 01:00:47,231
lakes and they became extinct by the 19 
thirties people hunted them.

1029
01:00:47,960 --> 01:00:48,793
They were regarded as a agricultural 
pest and so farmers basically killed 

1030
01:00:53,931 --> 01:00:54,764
them and enlisted government agents as 
had happened with wolves and coyotes to 

1031
01:00:59,890 --> 01:01:00,723
their wiped them out.
It's fascinating and I guess it makes 

1032
01:01:03,081 --> 01:01:03,914
sense,
but it's just fascinating that just a 

1033
01:01:05,210 --> 01:01:08,270
few hundred years ago they lacked the 
foresight to understand that any sort of

1034
01:01:08,271 --> 01:01:10,730
intrusion into the ecosystem,
any sort of,

1035
01:01:10,731 --> 01:01:11,564
you know,
eliminating one Predator or taking out 

1036
01:01:13,401 --> 01:01:17,720
one thing causes a cascade of events 
that can be disastrous.

1037
01:01:18,650 --> 01:01:19,483
Now.
People didn't know anything about 

1038
01:01:20,121 --> 01:01:21,050
ecology.
I mean,

1039
01:01:21,051 --> 01:01:21,884
you know,
we don't have a emerge as a science 

1040
01:01:23,391 --> 01:01:26,810
until the 18 sixties.
It may make sense,

1041
01:01:26,811 --> 01:01:27,644
but it's amazing.

1042
01:01:27,710 --> 01:01:30,140
It really is amazing and it knew so 
little.

1043
01:01:30,410 --> 01:01:34,370
We knew,
we knew very little and we tended to,

1044
01:01:34,830 --> 01:01:35,663
you know,
I'm in with a complete lack of 

1045
01:01:37,851 --> 01:01:38,684
knowledge.
I mean we did the same thing with the 

1046
01:01:40,700 --> 01:01:45,230
coyote attempt at exterminating them.
We,

1047
01:01:45,410 --> 01:01:50,410
we pass a law in Congress in 1931 to 
provide for the extermination of coyotes

1048
01:01:52,461 --> 01:01:53,294
into appropriate the money to do it.
I mean we spent probably $100,000,000 

1049
01:01:56,661 --> 01:01:57,494
over the next 40 or 50 years attempting 
to do it and pass that law at a time 

1050
01:02:03,021 --> 01:02:08,021
when we'd never sent the first 
scientists out to do any study of coyote

1051
01:02:08,961 --> 01:02:11,620
national history.
We had no idea what they ate,

1052
01:02:12,140 --> 01:02:12,973
had no clue about them,
but before we even have any science to 

1053
01:02:16,611 --> 01:02:19,590
go on at all,
we just go ahead and take step up.

1054
01:02:19,620 --> 01:02:20,453
Okay.
We're going to.

1055
01:02:20,580 --> 01:02:21,413
This is an ammo.
We're to completely weed out of the 

1056
01:02:25,710 --> 01:02:26,400
North American setting.

1057
01:02:26,400 --> 01:02:29,310
We're going to eliminate it.
I don't know a damn thing about it,

1058
01:02:29,370 --> 01:02:30,203
but we're gonna.
Make sure that this thing does not 

1059
01:02:32,490 --> 01:02:36,420
survive through the 20th century.
It's fascinating in your book,

1060
01:02:36,421 --> 01:02:39,510
the accounts of the early explorers who 
are trying to figure out what the hell a

1061
01:02:39,511 --> 01:02:42,480
coyote was.
They thought maybe it was a jackal.

1062
01:02:42,481 --> 01:02:43,314
They didn't know what it was,
and then they finally decided it was 

1063
01:02:45,601 --> 01:02:49,110
some sort of a small wolf and in the 
initial description of it,

1064
01:02:49,560 --> 01:02:51,450
where they call it a prairie wolfe 
prairie wolf.

1065
01:02:51,451 --> 01:02:52,180
That's right.
Yeah,

1066
01:02:52,180 --> 01:02:55,680
fine in a lot of people don't know this 
for most of the 19th century.

1067
01:02:55,980 --> 01:02:56,813
I mean I've.
I've seen references to this name as 

1068
01:02:59,101 --> 01:03:04,101
late as 1915 Americans call coyotes.
Pray Wolf's.

1069
01:03:05,460 --> 01:03:07,470
That was the name Lewis and Clark gave 
them.

1070
01:03:07,471 --> 01:03:09,540
And so that's what everybody called 
them.

1071
01:03:09,541 --> 01:03:13,230
And it wasn't until we started getting 
out into the southwest,

1072
01:03:13,740 --> 01:03:14,820
uh,
in the 18,

1073
01:03:14,821 --> 01:03:15,654
40 [inaudible] and 18 fifties,
especially around Santa fe where there 

1074
01:03:20,131 --> 01:03:20,964
were Indian people who had come up with 
the Spanish colonization of the 

1075
01:03:26,971 --> 01:03:31,050
southwest who spoke the language of the 
Aztecs.

1076
01:03:31,400 --> 01:03:32,233
That language is called know what and 
the word coyote comes from the Aztec 

1077
01:03:39,001 --> 01:03:39,834
language.
So when Americans were first getting 

1078
01:03:43,171 --> 01:03:44,004
into New Mexico in the 1840 [inaudible],
really they began encountering people 

1079
01:03:48,991 --> 01:03:51,900
who are using a different name for the 
animal.

1080
01:03:52,380 --> 01:03:53,213
And over the next 30 or 40 years,
that name sort of overtook the term 

1081
01:03:59,791 --> 01:04:02,580
prairie wolf and finally completely 
replaced it.

1082
01:04:03,180 --> 01:04:06,000
So the original name was an Aztec name.
Yeah.

1083
01:04:06,001 --> 01:04:07,950
It was an asset name.
Yeah.

1084
01:04:08,400 --> 01:04:11,430
And it's pronounced and in the know Hwat
language,

1085
01:04:11,460 --> 01:04:16,460
it's spelled and their language c o y o 
t t l,

1086
01:04:17,400 --> 01:04:18,233
but the l on the end is silent.
And so the way they pronounced it was 

1087
01:04:23,311 --> 01:04:26,000
quote.
And um,

1088
01:04:26,560 --> 01:04:28,570
I mean the Aztec language because they,
you know,

1089
01:04:28,580 --> 01:04:29,413
they were an empire and they,
they defeated a lot of peoples and they 

1090
01:04:32,791 --> 01:04:36,300
imposed their language and their customs
on a lot of people.

1091
01:04:36,720 --> 01:04:37,553
There were all sorts of Indians who 
weren't necessarily as check who spoke 

1092
01:04:39,841 --> 01:04:41,670
that language,
uh,

1093
01:04:41,700 --> 01:04:42,533
and there were evidently a enough of 
them in places like Santa Fe in Tucson 

1094
01:04:47,041 --> 01:04:50,220
that when a Anglo Americans got out 
there,

1095
01:04:50,250 --> 01:04:51,083
they,
they were encountering not only native 

1096
01:04:53,941 --> 01:04:54,774
people who were using that word,
but the Spanish not being privy to the 

1097
01:04:59,581 --> 01:05:00,414
American use of the term prairie wolf.
The Spanish had just adopted the Indian 

1098
01:05:04,920 --> 01:05:08,550
name for the animal.
And they had hispanicized it.

1099
01:05:08,820 --> 01:05:11,490
And they began,
they gave it an extra syllable.

1100
01:05:11,491 --> 01:05:12,324
So they call the animal a coil pot.
And that's what these early Americans 

1101
01:05:18,131 --> 01:05:18,964
were hearing.
They were largely hearing the Spanish 

1102
01:05:20,891 --> 01:05:23,440
pronunciation,
the three syllable version,

1103
01:05:23,441 --> 01:05:24,274
Cota Ota and Mark Twain comes along and 
the 18 seventies and writes a very 

1104
01:05:28,271 --> 01:05:30,970
famous book about the West roughing it.
Of course,

1105
01:05:30,971 --> 01:05:33,190
he's America's most famous writer at the
time,

1106
01:05:33,191 --> 01:05:37,510
his book as best seller a and Mark 
Twain,

1107
01:05:37,511 --> 01:05:39,640
not only kind of,
because we,

1108
01:05:39,641 --> 01:05:41,320
as you mentioned,
mentioned a minute ago,

1109
01:05:41,321 --> 01:05:43,510
we don't really know what to make of 
these animals.

1110
01:05:43,510 --> 01:05:46,300
Americans have never had an experience 
with an animal like this,

1111
01:05:46,301 --> 01:05:48,340
so we don't know what to think about 
them.

1112
01:05:48,520 --> 01:05:49,353
Mark Twain is the one who provides us 
with kind of a take on them as these 

1113
01:05:54,400 --> 01:05:55,233
cowardly,
despicable a little creatures that have 

1114
01:06:00,011 --> 01:06:01,450
this,
you know,

1115
01:06:01,480 --> 01:06:02,313
uh,
overgrown wolf skin and this is 

1116
01:06:03,991 --> 01:06:06,610
despairing look.
And he says,

1117
01:06:06,640 --> 01:06:07,473
you know,
they're,

1118
01:06:07,740 --> 01:06:08,573
they're such scoundrels in such 
scavengers that a flea would desert one 

1119
01:06:14,291 --> 01:06:16,120
for a philosophy,
you know,

1120
01:06:16,121 --> 01:06:17,350
and he's.
Mark Twain is humorous.

1121
01:06:17,351 --> 01:06:21,970
So he gets on this riff and he goes on 
for like three pages in this vein,

1122
01:06:21,971 --> 01:06:23,650
so that by the time you end up reading 
it,

1123
01:06:24,100 --> 01:06:26,350
your basic conviction is,
okay,

1124
01:06:26,351 --> 01:06:29,320
this is a despicable creature that's 
just breathing up good air.

1125
01:06:29,321 --> 01:06:31,990
So we should just get rid of it.
But he does.

1126
01:06:31,991 --> 01:06:35,050
In the course of that book,
tell Americans how,

1127
01:06:35,110 --> 01:06:38,020
what the animal is called and how you 
pronounce it.

1128
01:06:38,440 --> 01:06:39,750
And he says,
uh,

1129
01:06:39,820 --> 01:06:40,653
in the west,
this animal is called a coyote and he 

1130
01:06:44,740 --> 01:06:49,510
spelled it out phonetically given us our
modern pronunciation of coyote.

1131
01:06:49,570 --> 01:06:51,880
Saw our modern pronunciation comes from 
Mark Twain.

1132
01:06:51,940 --> 01:06:52,450
Yeah,
he's,

1133
01:06:52,450 --> 01:06:53,283
well,
he's the one who at least popularizes 

1134
01:06:54,610 --> 01:06:55,443
that.
And everybody who read his book 

1135
01:06:57,311 --> 01:07:01,780
basically kind of,
I think a absorbed that pronunciation of

1136
01:07:01,781 --> 01:07:04,000
it.
Why did these native Americans have such

1137
01:07:04,001 --> 01:07:04,834
a great respect for the coyote?
Like what was it about that animal that 

1138
01:07:08,570 --> 01:07:10,720
we created so many legends?
Oh,

1139
01:07:10,721 --> 01:07:15,721
that's a great story.
And as I argue in this book,

1140
01:07:15,731 --> 01:07:16,510
I mean,
I.

1141
01:07:16,510 --> 01:07:20,470
What I try to do with Coyote America is 
to tell the,

1142
01:07:20,560 --> 01:07:21,393
the biography of the animal from its 
evolutionary origins through its 

1143
01:07:25,661 --> 01:07:28,320
history,
up until the present time when of course

1144
01:07:28,390 --> 01:07:30,760
it's in everybody's backyard all over 
the country.

1145
01:07:30,761 --> 01:07:34,610
And so we're all all dealing with it and
having to figure out what it is and,

1146
01:07:34,840 --> 01:07:35,673
and how you coexist with it.
But it's a real rollercoaster ride 

1147
01:07:39,310 --> 01:07:41,290
because I mean,
it goes,

1148
01:07:41,820 --> 01:07:44,890
you know,
for a million years of its evolution,

1149
01:07:45,510 --> 01:07:46,343
uh,
confronting at certain times the return 

1150
01:07:51,521 --> 01:07:52,354
of gray wolves to North America,
which clearly don't like coyotes and 

1151
01:07:54,761 --> 01:07:55,594
beat the crap out of them and even 
probably influenced their evolutionary 

1152
01:07:59,261 --> 01:08:02,500
direction into a smaller,
more jackal like animal.

1153
01:08:03,550 --> 01:08:06,850
But then it also,
it has this story that's associated with

1154
01:08:06,851 --> 01:08:11,530
us when humans arrive in North America.
I mean,

1155
01:08:11,610 --> 01:08:16,220
coyotes get this wonderful peer.
It lasts like

1156
01:08:17,330 --> 01:08:18,163
14,000,
500 years or something where native 

1157
01:08:22,821 --> 01:08:27,821
people look at them and say,
that's the most intriguing animal on the

1158
01:08:30,951 --> 01:08:33,980
continent.
It's for one thing,

1159
01:08:34,730 --> 01:08:36,440
mammoths,
camels,

1160
01:08:36,441 --> 01:08:37,274
horses.
All these big charismatic animals are 

1161
01:08:39,561 --> 01:08:43,040
dying out around us in the pleistocene 
extinctions.

1162
01:08:43,580 --> 01:08:47,900
Somehow these little guys don't seem to 
be perturbed by it.

1163
01:08:48,290 --> 01:08:51,110
They're surviving while all of these big
creatures,

1164
01:08:51,111 --> 01:08:54,110
these big impressive creatures are going
away.

1165
01:08:54,740 --> 01:08:55,573
And I think they also,
at least this is what I argue in the 

1166
01:08:58,791 --> 01:08:59,624
book,
they had this sense that a coyote is 

1167
01:09:03,651 --> 01:09:04,484
live by their widths.
And I think that provided them with a 

1168
01:09:08,331 --> 01:09:13,331
model that they thought was valuable.
Because I think living successfully,

1169
01:09:14,631 --> 01:09:17,300
because you're smart,
you know,

1170
01:09:17,301 --> 01:09:20,660
is that's a trait that humans in any 
age,

1171
01:09:21,200 --> 01:09:23,930
including ours right now,
uh,

1172
01:09:24,080 --> 01:09:29,080
could very well a follow and find to be 
a,

1173
01:09:30,240 --> 01:09:31,073
a,
uh,

1174
01:09:31,110 --> 01:09:33,830
an effective way to go about facing your
future.

1175
01:09:34,280 --> 01:09:37,610
So they see this animal is being 
particularly smart,

1176
01:09:38,150 --> 01:09:40,760
particularly adaptable,
a survivor,

1177
01:09:41,480 --> 01:09:42,313
and because it was a social animal,
it has pups the pups don't know how to 

1178
01:09:48,080 --> 01:09:48,913
fend for themselves in the world.
And coyotes have to teach the pups just 

1179
01:09:52,851 --> 01:09:56,660
as humans do with their children.
How to become full grown coyotes and how

1180
01:09:56,661 --> 01:09:57,494
to survive that.
It seemed to have a lot of traits that 

1181
01:10:00,440 --> 01:10:05,360
people found familiar.
And so at some point in time,

1182
01:10:05,361 --> 01:10:06,860
and who knows when it was,
I mean,

1183
01:10:06,861 --> 01:10:11,360
it could have been 10,000 years ago,
they converted into Indian people in the

1184
01:10:11,361 --> 01:10:13,160
West everywhere.
Coyotes range,

1185
01:10:13,640 --> 01:10:16,970
convert this animal into one of their 
principle,

1186
01:10:17,060 --> 01:10:21,920
God's their principal deities and make 
it this sacred creature.

1187
01:10:22,550 --> 01:10:23,383
I mean,
they have no reason to kill them or 

1188
01:10:25,071 --> 01:10:25,904
harass them or anything.
And so instead they look at it as this 

1189
01:10:30,560 --> 01:10:33,860
Avatar,
this stand in for humans.

1190
01:10:33,861 --> 01:10:38,060
In the world,
study it really closely and they proceed

1191
01:10:38,061 --> 01:10:41,210
to create this body of,
of literature.

1192
01:10:41,211 --> 01:10:44,150
It's our oldest literature from North 
America,

1193
01:10:44,850 --> 01:10:45,683
uh,
in the form of oral stories that have 

1194
01:10:47,841 --> 01:10:51,290
coyote as the central character,
but it's not,

1195
01:10:51,320 --> 01:10:54,530
it's not the little coyote that's 
trotting through your camp.

1196
01:10:54,920 --> 01:10:55,753
It's a coyote man.
He's a character who stands on his hind 

1197
01:10:59,631 --> 01:11:00,464
legs.
He has pointed nose and he has direct 

1198
01:11:02,091 --> 01:11:02,924
ears and he has a tail,
but he's standing up and he personifies 

1199
01:11:08,090 --> 01:11:11,180
all the traits,
both good and bad of human beings.

1200
01:11:13,140 --> 01:11:14,230
It's,
it's

1201
01:11:14,330 --> 01:11:15,163
so weird.
That was the way we look at coyotes 

1202
01:11:16,980 --> 01:11:17,813
today is this new sense and this past,
and that's directly attributed to 

1203
01:11:20,641 --> 01:11:21,540
agriculture,
right?

1204
01:11:21,541 --> 01:11:24,210
Directly attributed to us having 
livestock anywhere near them,

1205
01:11:24,211 --> 01:11:27,840
deciding we want them out.
But if you look at the Museum of natural

1206
01:11:27,841 --> 01:11:29,460
history in Los Angeles,
when I was there,

1207
01:11:29,461 --> 01:11:31,160
I took a photo of it because it was so 
weird.

1208
01:11:31,180 --> 01:11:34,050
I put on my instagram there,
the photo,

1209
01:11:34,051 --> 01:11:36,240
the,
the stuffed coyote that they have there.

1210
01:11:36,241 --> 01:11:38,430
They have all these different animals.
They have African animals,

1211
01:11:38,670 --> 01:11:40,050
they have gorillas,
chimpanzees,

1212
01:11:40,051 --> 01:11:40,884
all these different stuffed animals.
I just sort of give you a sense of what 

1213
01:11:43,081 --> 01:11:43,914
they would look like with this mock 
natural environment that coyote is 

1214
01:11:46,650 --> 01:11:47,483
natural environment.
They show a porch and the coyote has a 

1215
01:11:49,891 --> 01:11:51,780
cat in it's mouth.
I mean,

1216
01:11:51,781 --> 01:11:54,390
this is this,
this is this image right here.

1217
01:11:54,630 --> 01:11:58,620
That is my photo that I took from the 
Museum of natural history.

1218
01:11:59,460 --> 01:12:02,880
It's like what?
Like that's the natural environment is a

1219
01:12:02,881 --> 01:12:05,090
porch with a cat in his mouth.
It's,

1220
01:12:05,180 --> 01:12:08,160
it's so bizarre.
But that's how human beings,

1221
01:12:08,161 --> 01:12:11,760
especially in and around La,
view them.

1222
01:12:11,761 --> 01:12:12,594
I know when I had my situation with the 
chicken before I started reading your 

1223
01:12:18,121 --> 01:12:19,830
book,
I thought about killing that coyote.

1224
01:12:19,840 --> 01:12:21,210
It was like,
I want to kill that fucker.

1225
01:12:21,211 --> 01:12:22,710
He killed my chicken.
I'm going to kill him.

1226
01:12:23,280 --> 01:12:24,113
Then I found out,
I believe I'm pretty sure that it was a 

1227
01:12:26,131 --> 01:12:27,990
female because,
uh,

1228
01:12:28,200 --> 01:12:29,033
he,
this female kind of honey Dick my dog 

1229
01:12:31,380 --> 01:12:32,213
into jumping the fence and efforting,
converting with her and that's how they 

1230
01:12:36,121 --> 01:12:39,450
got the chickens because my dog's huge.
I have a massive.

1231
01:12:39,630 --> 01:12:42,690
And he knocked over this.
When chickens,

1232
01:12:43,650 --> 01:12:44,620
when they,
uh,

1233
01:12:44,640 --> 01:12:46,050
they,
they brewed.

1234
01:12:46,080 --> 01:12:47,930
Do you know about chickens brooding?
Do you know that?

1235
01:12:47,940 --> 01:12:49,920
My Dad had chickens in Louisiana.

1236
01:12:49,920 --> 01:12:51,180
So yeah,
I kind of,

1237
01:12:51,181 --> 01:12:51,660
uh,
you know,

1238
01:12:51,660 --> 01:12:54,600
hanging out with him when I would go 
back and visit.

1239
01:12:55,020 --> 01:12:55,853
Uh,
I came to know a little bit about 

1240
01:12:58,020 --> 01:12:58,920
chickens.
Well,

1241
01:12:59,070 --> 01:13:01,950
people don't know what happens is 
chickens think that their eggs,

1242
01:13:02,070 --> 01:13:02,903
the only way the chickens have eggs 
every day pretty much or sort of every 

1243
01:13:05,091 --> 01:13:06,060
day,
every few days.

1244
01:13:06,420 --> 01:13:08,640
And when they have an egg,
a,

1245
01:13:08,700 --> 01:13:09,533
those eggs are non-viable.
That's one of the reasons why 

1246
01:13:10,801 --> 01:13:13,290
vegetarians can eat chicken eggs and get
protein from them.

1247
01:13:13,500 --> 01:13:15,030
You're not hurting anybody.
They have the eggs,

1248
01:13:15,031 --> 01:13:18,510
whether or not there's a chicken there 
are any or not.

1249
01:13:18,810 --> 01:13:19,643
They always have the egg and it has to 
be fertilized by the rooster in order 

1250
01:13:23,641 --> 01:13:25,860
for it to become a chicken.
I didn't figure that out,

1251
01:13:25,861 --> 01:13:29,460
so it was almost 40,
but my stupid head,

1252
01:13:29,461 --> 01:13:30,031
I was like,
oh,

1253
01:13:30,031 --> 01:13:30,864
the egg means there's a chicken and 
there you just gotTa Cook it before it 

1254
01:13:33,211 --> 01:13:33,930
becomes a chicken.

1255
01:13:33,930 --> 01:13:35,670
No stupid.
Anyway.

1256
01:13:35,910 --> 01:13:39,300
Um,
the chicken sometimes are convinced that

1257
01:13:39,301 --> 01:13:41,640
these non viable eggs will become 
chicks.

1258
01:13:41,641 --> 01:13:45,840
And so they sit on them and they start 
plucking their feathers out and it takes

1259
01:13:45,841 --> 01:13:46,674
the entire cycle that an egg would be 
viable and become a chick for them to 

1260
01:13:50,251 --> 01:13:53,040
get out of it.
The only way to stop them is to put them

1261
01:13:53,041 --> 01:13:55,050
on a perch and put them in a smaller 
cage.

1262
01:13:55,320 --> 01:13:57,510
So we put them in a perch and the 
smaller cage,

1263
01:13:57,511 --> 01:14:01,290
we separate them from the chicken coop 
and the coyote had figured this out,

1264
01:14:01,710 --> 01:14:02,543
that this chicken was by itself and 
convinced the massive to knock the cage 

1265
01:14:06,671 --> 01:14:09,480
over because it was too small to knock 
this coop over.

1266
01:14:09,660 --> 01:14:11,530
But the master is 140 pounds.
He's like,

1267
01:14:11,531 --> 01:14:12,010
I'll fucking

1268
01:14:12,010 --> 01:14:15,730
take care of.
He knocks the coop down that coyote says

1269
01:14:15,731 --> 01:14:16,564
thanks.
Grabs the chicken and then jumps and 

1270
01:14:18,401 --> 01:14:20,830
hops the fence.
And I was talking to my neighbor about,

1271
01:14:20,831 --> 01:14:21,730
he's like,
Oh man,

1272
01:14:21,731 --> 01:14:23,440
I fucking hate coyotes.
I go,

1273
01:14:23,441 --> 01:14:26,830
do you like rats?
Because if you don't like rats,

1274
01:14:26,831 --> 01:14:27,664
you should thank the coyotes.
The reason why we're not infested with 

1275
01:14:29,381 --> 01:14:31,390
rats,
I mean we're in the hills.

1276
01:14:31,391 --> 01:14:33,340
When you're in the hills,
out here in California,

1277
01:14:33,580 --> 01:14:36,040
there's rats and rodents everywhere,
but they're not,

1278
01:14:36,280 --> 01:14:38,230
and the reason why is because these 
coyotes,

1279
01:14:39,460 --> 01:14:40,293
we make that mistake so often where we 
think that we're smart and we're going 

1280
01:14:44,431 --> 01:14:48,010
to eliminate one thing in this,
this system,

1281
01:14:48,190 --> 01:14:49,450
and it's gonna be fine.
Now.

1282
01:14:49,480 --> 01:14:52,480
All we have to do is take out this 
coyote and everything will be great,

1283
01:14:52,481 --> 01:14:53,314
but no,
you're going to have a rat infestation 

1284
01:14:55,040 --> 01:14:55,873
and that's one of the things that you 
talked about in your book about farmers 

1285
01:14:58,870 --> 01:14:59,703
who had chased off the coyotes and they 
had rapid infestations and they were 

1286
01:15:04,421 --> 01:15:05,620
praying for coyotes.

1287
01:15:05,680 --> 01:15:08,620
I mean this happens in a just over and 
over and over again.

1288
01:15:08,621 --> 01:15:09,454
And so I think one of the reasons that 
we tend to make endlessly make the same 

1289
01:15:13,991 --> 01:15:18,991
mistake with animals like this is 
because we don't try to spend any effort

1290
01:15:19,750 --> 01:15:20,583
to understand the ecological world 
around us and to understand their role 

1291
01:15:26,501 --> 01:15:28,990
in it in particular.
And you know what I mean?

1292
01:15:28,991 --> 01:15:33,310
I've been going around the country a lot
over the last eight months talking about

1293
01:15:33,311 --> 01:15:34,144
this book because obviously everybody is
dealing with them and some people are 

1294
01:15:37,151 --> 01:15:37,984
brand new in dealing with them and they 
were alarmed first of all that there's 

1295
01:15:41,950 --> 01:15:45,550
this small wolf trotting down the street
or through their yard.

1296
01:15:45,850 --> 01:15:47,620
And then of course they immediately 
here.

1297
01:15:47,621 --> 01:15:48,454
Well,
it's going to get your cat scan to get 

1298
01:15:49,811 --> 01:15:52,960
your small dog.
It's got a level to grab your three year

1299
01:15:52,961 --> 01:15:53,350
old.

1300
01:15:53,350 --> 01:15:56,050
I mean,
you just saw the horror stories,

1301
01:15:56,540 --> 01:15:57,373
uh,
through kind of urban legend make the 

1302
01:16:00,161 --> 01:16:01,390
rounds,
you know,

1303
01:16:01,391 --> 01:16:06,391
at a,
at an accelerated rate and sort of basic

1304
01:16:07,330 --> 01:16:08,163
good information about the animal 
doesn't make the round very effectively 

1305
01:16:11,680 --> 01:16:13,030
at all.
It's not fun.

1306
01:16:13,310 --> 01:16:14,470
No,
it's not fun.

1307
01:16:14,471 --> 01:16:15,304
But what you have to grapple with first 
of all is you've got to start with a 

1308
01:16:19,271 --> 01:16:20,104
position,
which I'll admit this is not the 

1309
01:16:21,731 --> 01:16:26,620
American position to take.
It's the position that in this instance,

1310
01:16:26,650 --> 01:16:31,390
we have confronted a part of the natural
world that we are not able to control.

1311
01:16:31,840 --> 01:16:33,760
We can't control coyotes.

1312
01:16:35,950 --> 01:16:36,783
We met resistance basically as futile.
They're going to be among us no matter 

1313
01:16:41,441 --> 01:16:43,030
what we do.
I mean,

1314
01:16:43,031 --> 01:16:44,840
you can certainly take out.
I,

1315
01:16:44,980 --> 01:16:45,813
you know,
coyotes are individuals and so if 

1316
01:16:47,381 --> 01:16:50,680
there's a bad actor in the neighborhood 
and very few of them,

1317
01:16:50,681 --> 01:16:55,180
by the way in the studies of coyotes in 
urban settings are bad actors,

1318
01:16:55,181 --> 01:16:56,014
but occasionally there's one that starts
catching cats are a starts chasing dogs 

1319
01:17:00,191 --> 01:17:01,024
or something.
I mean you can take that one out and 

1320
01:17:02,501 --> 01:17:03,334
perhaps improve the situation,
but just blanket going after any coyote 

1321
01:17:09,680 --> 01:17:14,680
you're afraid of something like your cat
might disappear is going to boomerang in

1322
01:17:16,341 --> 01:17:17,174
every instance because attempts to 
persecute them as I try to point out 

1323
01:17:20,480 --> 01:17:21,313
over and over and Coyote America result 
in every case and more coyotes and and 

1324
01:17:27,491 --> 01:17:32,491
it skews the populations so that what 
you end up with are often youngsters,

1325
01:17:32,570 --> 01:17:33,403
teenagers,
that like human teenagers get in more 

1326
01:17:35,841 --> 01:17:37,880
trouble than adults do.

1327
01:17:38,510 --> 01:17:39,343
So the thing that I keep trying to do,
and of course there's a group in 

1328
01:17:43,850 --> 01:17:44,683
California and San Francisco called 
project coyote that's been at this a 

1329
01:17:49,610 --> 01:17:54,200
trying to help people understand how to 
coexist but coexist with coyotes for the

1330
01:17:54,201 --> 01:17:58,250
last seven or eight years.
What you have to do is first of all,

1331
01:17:58,251 --> 01:17:59,870
accept the fact that,
okay,

1332
01:17:59,930 --> 01:18:02,300
resistance is futile.
These animals are here.

1333
01:18:02,840 --> 01:18:04,940
They know how to live in an urban 
setting.

1334
01:18:04,970 --> 01:18:06,920
They know how to live in the hills 
around me.

1335
01:18:07,280 --> 01:18:12,280
Now I've got to figure out how I live 
with coyotes in my life.

1336
01:18:13,850 --> 01:18:14,683
And I mean,
the obvious thing is you don't let your 

1337
01:18:17,511 --> 01:18:20,270
cats out in the morning to go hunt 
songbirds.

1338
01:18:20,510 --> 01:18:24,550
You don't let your cats out at night.
I mean the coyotes are,

1339
01:18:24,740 --> 01:18:25,573
in most instances,
not attacking cats are small dogs 

1340
01:18:29,121 --> 01:18:34,121
because they want to eat them.
They regard them as competitor predators

1341
01:18:34,611 --> 01:18:39,611
in their territory and so they're 
attacking them because that's how they.

1342
01:18:39,810 --> 01:18:42,080
They see them,
but they do eat them,

1343
01:18:42,081 --> 01:18:42,570
right?
Well,

1344
01:18:42,570 --> 01:18:43,403
they,
they will eat them in some instances 

1345
01:18:46,190 --> 01:18:49,250
when they're trying to provision a 
litter of pups.

1346
01:18:49,580 --> 01:18:50,413
So the times when cats will be snatched 
by coyotes and will disappear and you 

1347
01:18:56,331 --> 01:18:57,164
don't see the cat again is often the 
period from basically about now from 

1348
01:19:00,740 --> 01:19:01,573
April through about July,
that's when they have their litters and 

1349
01:19:05,391 --> 01:19:09,980
I mean it's sometimes hard to come up 
with enough protein to raise five or six

1350
01:19:09,981 --> 01:19:13,640
little coyote pups.
And so occasionally a cat or a small dog

1351
01:19:13,641 --> 01:19:14,474
will be taken away.
But usually what happens with cats and 

1352
01:19:17,691 --> 01:19:20,570
small dogs is that Kylie's attack them 
and they just leave them there.

1353
01:19:21,260 --> 01:19:23,780
And I've told people for,
uh,

1354
01:19:23,810 --> 01:19:24,643
for most of this year,
I mean this is from my own experience 

1355
01:19:26,990 --> 01:19:27,823
because I've lived in the urban 
wildlands interface for almost all my 

1356
01:19:30,711 --> 01:19:33,380
adult life out in the countryside away 
from town.

1357
01:19:34,280 --> 01:19:35,113
Whenever you find your cat,
that's probably a coyote and its attack 

1358
01:19:41,541 --> 01:19:44,810
the cat because it thinks it's a 
competitor and it attacks,

1359
01:19:44,811 --> 01:19:45,800
it kills.
It leaves it.

1360
01:19:46,550 --> 01:19:50,690
If the animal disappears,
if your cat disappears and you never see

1361
01:19:50,691 --> 01:19:51,524
it again,
either that's happened in the time when 

1362
01:19:54,741 --> 01:19:59,660
they're provisioning pups or if it 
happens in the fall or the winter or the

1363
01:19:59,720 --> 01:20:02,270
early spring.
And your cat totally disappears.

1364
01:20:02,900 --> 01:20:05,430
It probably was a great horned owl that 
got your cat.

1365
01:20:05,880 --> 01:20:07,980
I mean als pluck

1366
01:20:07,980 --> 01:20:11,700
cats and take them to their roost and 
devour them.

1367
01:20:11,701 --> 01:20:14,610
And so your cat disappears.
Then you never see it again.

1368
01:20:15,060 --> 01:20:17,310
But what almost everybody does now that 
we know,

1369
01:20:17,311 --> 01:20:20,490
we've got coyotes as hear coyotes 
howling and the hills,

1370
01:20:21,150 --> 01:20:23,790
the neighbor had a cat disappeared.
Of course it was a coyote.

1371
01:20:24,090 --> 01:20:25,360
Coyote got it.
Yeah.

1372
01:20:25,430 --> 01:20:26,263
But it might not be a,
I would say in a pretty sizeable 

1373
01:20:29,311 --> 01:20:30,144
percentage of cases.
It was actually a great horned owl that 

1374
01:20:33,451 --> 01:20:34,284
got the cat and not a coyote.
There's a great video that I found 

1375
01:20:36,601 --> 01:20:37,434
online that I put on my instagram of an 
owl snatching some other raptor right 

1376
01:20:41,401 --> 01:20:42,960
out of its nest.
Have you ever seen it?

1377
01:20:43,110 --> 01:20:44,910
I haven't seen it.
But uh,

1378
01:20:45,300 --> 01:20:49,560
it's someone that had like a trail cam,
a video up a black and white trail cam.

1379
01:20:49,561 --> 01:20:50,394
And you see the owl flying in the 
distance or is it you see the eyes and 

1380
01:20:54,841 --> 01:20:55,674
then you see it snap and the other bird 
in the nest doesn't even know what 

1381
01:20:57,991 --> 01:20:59,340
happened.
It had watched this.

1382
01:20:59,430 --> 01:21:01,230
Yeah,
it happened so fast.

1383
01:21:01,440 --> 01:21:03,720
So what first of all,
do you know what kind of animal that is?

1384
01:21:03,721 --> 01:21:05,010
That.
What would that bird is?

1385
01:21:05,130 --> 01:21:07,320
Can you tell by looking at it?
It looks like a hawk.

1386
01:21:07,321 --> 01:21:10,380
Have some fledgling.
Boom.

1387
01:21:10,381 --> 01:21:11,214
That's it.
I look at the other ones like what 

1388
01:21:11,821 --> 01:21:14,340
happened?
What's going on?

1389
01:21:14,370 --> 01:21:15,990
Yeah,
that's a hawk of some kind.

1390
01:21:15,991 --> 01:21:16,824
Maybe a red tail and the fledgling.
Just the eyes and the distance are 

1391
01:21:19,651 --> 01:21:21,080
amazing.
Look through these eyes.

1392
01:21:21,081 --> 01:21:22,370
Sneaking up.
Look at this.

1393
01:21:22,430 --> 01:21:23,263
Here it comes.

1394
01:21:26,340 --> 01:21:28,170
It's so funny that we think of that 
thing is.

1395
01:21:28,171 --> 01:21:30,210
Oh the wise old owl.
Give a hoot.

1396
01:21:30,211 --> 01:21:31,860
Don't pollute.
Meanwhile,

1397
01:21:31,861 --> 01:21:34,080
those motherfuckers are as evil as it 
gets.

1398
01:21:34,260 --> 01:21:35,093
Well they are definitely major predators
and they hear the stories about them in 

1399
01:21:38,871 --> 01:21:40,480
New Mexico.
I mean there.

1400
01:21:40,530 --> 01:21:41,363
I've got friends who were sitting at a,
at an outdoor bar a couple of years ago 

1401
01:21:45,391 --> 01:21:46,224
with a railing on it.
It was a late afternoon and a cat was 

1402
01:21:48,361 --> 01:21:51,630
walking along the railing,
whether sitting there with their drinks,

1403
01:21:51,631 --> 01:21:52,464
shooting the shit,
and all of a sudden an al comes in and 

1404
01:21:55,290 --> 01:21:56,123
in a flash plucks that cat off the 
railing and the next thing they say is 

1405
01:21:59,101 --> 01:21:59,934
the owl flying off to the cottonwood 
trees over the creek with this cat 

1406
01:22:02,911 --> 01:22:04,990
dangling from its.
Yeah,

1407
01:22:05,400 --> 01:22:07,290
while they're all sitting there with 
their drinks,

1408
01:22:07,640 --> 01:22:08,473
poison in the air.
I was driving home one day and I saw 

1409
01:22:11,581 --> 01:22:14,370
this hour,
we'll fly right above my head and I must

1410
01:22:14,371 --> 01:22:15,204
have apparently while I was driving,
it must have got this rabbit somewhere 

1411
01:22:20,101 --> 01:22:20,934
close to it and I startled it so it's 
flying off and decided to drop the 

1412
01:22:24,151 --> 01:22:24,840
rabbit.

1413
01:22:24,840 --> 01:22:28,380
So we're like right in front of me in 
the highway or the road.

1414
01:22:28,381 --> 01:22:30,060
Was this eviscerated rabbit?
No.

1415
01:22:30,120 --> 01:22:32,500
Big Rabbit too.
And I was in that.

1416
01:22:32,610 --> 01:22:34,980
That was one of the first years that I 
lived here.

1417
01:22:35,130 --> 01:22:36,360
And I remember thinking,
Oh,

1418
01:22:36,361 --> 01:22:37,194
I gotta read.
I gotta recalibrate my idea when an owl 

1419
01:22:39,211 --> 01:22:40,044
is getting.
Because it was just torn apart and it 

1420
01:22:41,971 --> 01:22:45,960
was a big rabbit and I saw this.
I mean it was a big owl too,

1421
01:22:45,990 --> 01:22:47,340
so the whole thing was like,
Whoa,

1422
01:22:47,520 --> 01:22:50,330
this is a predator,
this isn't just a bird icon.

1423
01:22:50,430 --> 01:22:53,310
They and that's the way they killed two.
That's what they do with cats.

1424
01:22:53,311 --> 01:22:55,470
They eviscerate them,
they put a talent.

1425
01:22:55,950 --> 01:22:59,420
I'm basically into their ass and just 
rip it all the way up,

1426
01:22:59,680 --> 01:23:03,270
all the way up to their sternum,
spilled their guts out.

1427
01:23:03,720 --> 01:23:04,553
Whew.
There's a wildlife near here and we 

1428
01:23:06,671 --> 01:23:07,504
visited a couple of times and they have 
owls there and you get to see them and 

1429
01:23:10,930 --> 01:23:11,763
check them out up close like animals 
that had been injured and things like 

1430
01:23:13,901 --> 01:23:14,110
that.

1431
01:23:14,110 --> 01:23:17,300
And you just see the talents on those 
suckers and just woof.

1432
01:23:17,710 --> 01:23:18,760
There's serious.
Yeah.

1433
01:23:18,770 --> 01:23:23,650
It's fascinating how we anthropomorphize
some of these animals and turn them into

1434
01:23:23,651 --> 01:23:25,150
these cutie pies.
You know,

1435
01:23:25,151 --> 01:23:25,984
like polar bears are selling Coca Cola 
and Klondike bars and owls are selling 

1436
01:23:29,381 --> 01:23:32,350
tootsie roll pops.
We evolved it just they're out there,

1437
01:23:32,351 --> 01:23:34,120
Jack and cats.
You know,

1438
01:23:34,420 --> 01:23:35,253
there's a video in Los Angeles and one 
of the reasons why I wanted to ask you 

1439
01:23:38,621 --> 01:23:41,710
about this is because I'd heard you say 
before,

1440
01:23:41,711 --> 01:23:46,390
I think on Renell's podcast,
what you just said about cats and dogs,

1441
01:23:46,391 --> 01:23:48,250
that essentially they're there,
the coyotes,

1442
01:23:48,251 --> 01:23:50,950
think of them as competitive predators.
Yeah.

1443
01:23:51,370 --> 01:23:54,580
But there's a video in Los Angeles,
uh,

1444
01:23:54,850 --> 01:23:59,820
in Hollywood have a coyote eating a cat 
on a lawn and a,

1445
01:23:59,890 --> 01:24:00,723
these people are in the car watching and
they're filming it and they're freaking 

1446
01:24:04,031 --> 01:24:04,331
out.
Like,

1447
01:24:04,331 --> 01:24:05,230
oh my God.

1448
01:24:05,230 --> 01:24:07,540
Oh my God,
it's Kylie was just sitting there eating

1449
01:24:07,541 --> 01:24:08,374
that cat.
So you think that the reason why it's 

1450
01:24:10,421 --> 01:24:12,830
eating that music just hungry maybe,
or is it,

1451
01:24:12,890 --> 01:24:13,723
is it an occasional meal that they think
of them as prey or is it primarily 

1452
01:24:19,030 --> 01:24:19,863
because they're a bunch of different 
factors or is it primarily because 

1453
01:24:21,941 --> 01:24:23,710
they're competitive predators?
Well,

1454
01:24:23,711 --> 01:24:27,100
I think it's primarily because of that,
but I mean there are.

1455
01:24:27,640 --> 01:24:28,770
So,
you know,

1456
01:24:29,350 --> 01:24:32,500
there's coyotes are so individualistic.
Okay.

1457
01:24:32,510 --> 01:24:35,090
That's soccer hanging out right now.
Like,

1458
01:24:35,120 --> 01:24:36,580
hi,
how are you?

1459
01:24:36,640 --> 01:24:39,610
Wild animal walking by the car,
right in Los Angeles.

1460
01:24:39,611 --> 01:24:40,444
I mean,
just so bizarre that they're so 

1461
01:24:41,501 --> 01:24:45,650
comfortable around people treat like a 
little city streets.

1462
01:24:46,400 --> 01:24:47,890
It's thinking about walking across the 
street,

1463
01:24:48,070 --> 01:24:50,560
don't know how to navigate the streets 
like that too.

1464
01:24:50,590 --> 01:24:51,423
So strange.
How does it figure out how to make it 

1465
01:24:53,591 --> 01:24:54,670
across the street?

1466
01:24:55,240 --> 01:24:56,070
You know,
there's a,

1467
01:24:56,070 --> 01:24:56,903
there's a biologist in Chicago who 
argues that in rush hour traffic on the 

1468
01:25:01,061 --> 01:25:01,894
interstate in Chicago,
9 million people there that he's seen 

1469
01:25:04,541 --> 01:25:05,374
coyotes cross four lanes of the 
interstate and stop in the median and 

1470
01:25:10,841 --> 01:25:15,640
sit there and wait until the traffic 
lightens up for the other four lanes and

1471
01:25:15,641 --> 01:25:17,650
then cross that way.
So this is,

1472
01:25:17,651 --> 01:25:18,484
uh,
the coyote goes and gets this cat that 

1473
01:25:21,281 --> 01:25:24,190
apparently it had already killed before 
he starts eating it.

1474
01:25:24,340 --> 01:25:25,600
So it's got it right there.
Yeah.

1475
01:25:25,700 --> 01:25:28,510
That thing at his feet.
His cat.

1476
01:25:28,570 --> 01:25:30,010
Yeah.
Well,

1477
01:25:30,011 --> 01:25:33,160
what I was going to say about that is 
that yeah,

1478
01:25:33,180 --> 01:25:34,770
it's all stiff.
Yeah.

1479
01:25:34,810 --> 01:25:38,860
Well he's.
So what a strange animal.

1480
01:25:39,090 --> 01:25:39,820
You know.
So.

1481
01:25:39,820 --> 01:25:43,420
So two things I would observe about this
particular video is,

1482
01:25:43,780 --> 01:25:45,890
first of all,
you know,

1483
01:25:45,970 --> 01:25:50,350
everybody is making the assumption that 
coyote killed the cat.

1484
01:25:51,070 --> 01:25:55,990
That cat may have been hit by a car and 
the coyote founded in is scavenging it.

1485
01:25:56,020 --> 01:25:57,570
How about another stupid cat behind 
them?

1486
01:25:58,240 --> 01:26:02,680
That's my friend right behind the low.
Why are you eating my friend?

1487
01:26:05,600 --> 01:26:06,433
The other thing I would say is that 
they're so individualistic that 

1488
01:26:09,711 --> 01:26:12,680
sometimes cats,
they develop.

1489
01:26:12,870 --> 01:26:17,660
A coyote is develop a yen for cats.
I could taste.

1490
01:26:17,720 --> 01:26:18,553
Yes,
they develop a taste for them and so I 

1491
01:26:19,701 --> 01:26:20,750
mean,
there are examples.

1492
01:26:20,900 --> 01:26:21,733
There was a coyote pack in Seattle and 
also one in Tucson that basically did 

1493
01:26:26,871 --> 01:26:28,100
this very thing.
They.

1494
01:26:28,670 --> 01:26:33,470
They decided that cats,
we're going to be their target now.

1495
01:26:33,471 --> 01:26:35,210
Most coyotes,
you know,

1496
01:26:35,270 --> 01:26:36,103
that's not how they react to cats,
but cats do kill an unbelievable amount 

1497
01:26:41,091 --> 01:26:42,600
of rodents and birds.
Yeah,

1498
01:26:42,680 --> 01:26:44,660
and people don't want to hear this of 
course,

1499
01:26:44,661 --> 01:26:48,680
but the truth is that in all cities were
coyotes have spread,

1500
01:26:48,681 --> 01:26:49,514
which is literally everywhere now.
We have from the ornithologists a 

1501
01:26:54,980 --> 01:26:55,813
decided record of numbers of nesting 
songbirds going up dramatically as a 

1502
01:27:00,771 --> 01:27:03,080
result of the appearance of coyotes.
Yeah.

1503
01:27:03,081 --> 01:27:07,760
There was a statistic that we quoted on 
the podcast and it's something insane,

1504
01:27:07,761 --> 01:27:12,761
like 3 billion birds a year in North 
America alone are killed by cats,

1505
01:27:14,571 --> 01:27:18,050
by house cats b with a b.

1506
01:27:18,130 --> 01:27:19,490
yeah.
When you tell that to people,

1507
01:27:19,491 --> 01:27:20,570
they're like,
there's no way,

1508
01:27:20,680 --> 01:27:22,340
but look,
these are biologists.

1509
01:27:22,341 --> 01:27:23,900
These are people that are actually 
studying this,

1510
01:27:23,901 --> 01:27:26,410
and it blew them away.
I don't know how they studied it.

1511
01:27:26,411 --> 01:27:27,740
I don't.
Maybe you could enlighten me.

1512
01:27:27,770 --> 01:27:28,491
Well,
I don't either.

1513
01:27:28,491 --> 01:27:30,950
I mean,
one point 7 billion years annually,

1514
01:27:31,710 --> 01:27:34,880
seven birds in the continental us.
That is so crazy.

1515
01:27:34,910 --> 01:27:36,500
That's us.
That's not Canada.

1516
01:27:36,530 --> 01:27:37,363
It's not Mexico.
Continental us and I read a similar 

1517
01:27:40,850 --> 01:27:44,000
study in natural history magazine a few 
years ago about Great Britain.

1518
01:27:44,240 --> 01:27:45,530
Same,
same kind of thing.

1519
01:27:45,590 --> 01:27:46,500
Yeah.
Uh,

1520
01:27:46,550 --> 01:27:48,830
I don't remember the figures anymore,
but yeah,

1521
01:27:48,900 --> 01:27:50,200
I mean cats,
you know,

1522
01:27:50,240 --> 01:27:51,073
they devastate bird populations and so 
letting your cat Rome out through the 

1523
01:27:56,691 --> 01:27:57,524
neighborhood.
And it seems like this very 

1524
01:27:58,911 --> 01:28:01,670
compassionate thing to do.
You know,

1525
01:28:02,480 --> 01:28:07,340
fluffy wants to be out,
fluffy needs some space to roam,

1526
01:28:07,760 --> 01:28:12,760
but you're releasing an extremely 
effective Predator into the world.

1527
01:28:13,370 --> 01:28:18,370
And that's the results of it and when 
coyotes have shown up in town,

1528
01:28:20,180 --> 01:28:24,100
it's suddenly getting a lot harder to 
make a living as a bird killing cats.

1529
01:28:24,400 --> 01:28:25,233
And so we're,
we're getting a sharp uptick now in 

1530
01:28:29,020 --> 01:28:31,070
songbirds.
Yeah,

1531
01:28:31,071 --> 01:28:34,280
it's interesting how it all just cycles 
and I'll just make sense and I'll figure

1532
01:28:34,281 --> 01:28:36,170
it out at all.
Seeks its own level.

1533
01:28:36,510 --> 01:28:37,343
I'm.
One of the things that I've found 

1534
01:28:37,791 --> 01:28:38,624
hilarious was we were talking on is a 
podcast about a group that approached 

1535
01:28:41,151 --> 01:28:44,390
you and they were doing a documentary on
saving the coyote.

1536
01:28:45,260 --> 01:28:48,290
Yes.
And it was a,

1537
01:28:48,800 --> 01:28:50,540
a couple of women,
uh,

1538
01:28:50,600 --> 01:28:51,290
who,
uh,

1539
01:28:51,290 --> 01:28:55,160
were pretty fresh in into the southwest 
and Santa Fe.

1540
01:28:55,161 --> 01:28:55,994
They hadn't been in town for very long 
and they were interested in doing a 

1541
01:29:00,630 --> 01:29:02,160
documentary to save

1542
01:29:02,160 --> 01:29:05,460
the Coyote and uh,
you know,

1543
01:29:05,461 --> 01:29:09,300
so I mean there's a way to approach 
doing something like that.

1544
01:29:09,360 --> 01:29:10,530
Uh,
I mean you could say,

1545
01:29:10,531 --> 01:29:11,364
okay,
so I want wildlife services to stop 

1546
01:29:14,430 --> 01:29:18,030
killing 80,000 of them a year on behalf 
of agriculture.

1547
01:29:18,930 --> 01:29:19,763
Uh,
but what these women didn't seem to 

1548
01:29:22,530 --> 01:29:23,363
quite have a handle on was that coyotes 
don't need our help in saving 

1549
01:29:30,721 --> 01:29:34,170
themselves.
They're perfectly capable of doing it.

1550
01:29:34,710 --> 01:29:35,760
And so,
uh,

1551
01:29:36,420 --> 01:29:38,550
this is not an animal you have to worry 
about,

1552
01:29:38,551 --> 01:29:42,000
for example,
going on the endangered species list.

1553
01:29:42,660 --> 01:29:43,493
Uh,
and that's not gonna happen as one of 

1554
01:29:47,701 --> 01:29:49,680
the people who blurbed my book.
In fact,

1555
01:29:49,681 --> 01:29:51,620
it was bill mckibben,
the nature writer.

1556
01:29:51,630 --> 01:29:53,910
Now that I think about it,
one of the things he said was that,

1557
01:29:54,410 --> 01:29:55,243
uh,
in his blurb was that a biologist wants 

1558
01:29:57,601 --> 01:30:02,601
told him that when the last human dies 
on earth,

1559
01:30:04,140 --> 01:30:09,140
a coyote will be sitting on that humans 
grave howling at the moon.

1560
01:30:11,760 --> 01:30:14,610
I've always loved that thought because 
of course it's a,

1561
01:30:15,330 --> 01:30:18,410
it's an indication of how,
what great survivors they are.

1562
01:30:18,540 --> 01:30:19,100
Well,

1563
01:30:19,100 --> 01:30:22,240
you are starting to see a resurgence of 
wolves in Europe.

1564
01:30:22,270 --> 01:30:23,103
And,
uh,

1565
01:30:23,170 --> 01:30:28,170
there was actually an article recently 
published in Paris about it were,

1566
01:30:28,201 --> 01:30:29,034
uh,
I guess the mayor of Paris was telling 

1567
01:30:30,131 --> 01:30:30,964
people not to be alarmed because they 
only look for four legged pray and 

1568
01:30:34,331 --> 01:30:35,890
people shouldn't be worried about these 
wolves.

1569
01:30:36,280 --> 01:30:40,120
But the idea of these animals like 
intermingling with our,

1570
01:30:40,390 --> 01:30:42,210
with our civilization,
you know,

1571
01:30:42,220 --> 01:30:43,270
we,
we have decided,

1572
01:30:43,271 --> 01:30:46,090
we put some hardscape down,
put up some houses,

1573
01:30:46,091 --> 01:30:47,440
and we'll go,
this is our stuff.

1574
01:30:47,830 --> 01:30:48,663
You got to stay out and they don't 
recognize these boundaries and now 

1575
01:30:51,611 --> 01:30:54,430
you're slowly starting to see these 
animals creep back in,

1576
01:30:54,460 --> 01:30:55,900
in Paris,
France,

1577
01:30:55,990 --> 01:30:56,930
in Paris.
That's right.

1578
01:30:57,500 --> 01:30:59,080
Yeah.
Well,

1579
01:30:59,140 --> 01:30:59,741
uh,
you know,

1580
01:30:59,741 --> 01:31:02,560
I think when we moved into cities 5,000 
years ago,

1581
01:31:02,561 --> 01:31:04,930
one of the things we thought we were 
getting away from,

1582
01:31:04,960 --> 01:31:07,480
by living in cities was predators.
Yeah.

1583
01:31:07,660 --> 01:31:09,380
And the most part we have.
Yeah.

1584
01:31:09,530 --> 01:31:09,770
Most

1585
01:31:09,770 --> 01:31:10,420
part we have.
I mean,

1586
01:31:10,420 --> 01:31:11,360
we don't have,
you know,

1587
01:31:11,361 --> 01:31:12,194
at least not so far.
We don't have lepers in patrolling the 

1588
01:31:14,691 --> 01:31:16,420
alleys and,
and,

1589
01:31:16,421 --> 01:31:17,600
uh,
Denver.

1590
01:31:17,601 --> 01:31:20,240
But I,
you know,

1591
01:31:20,270 --> 01:31:23,990
I'm intrigued by one of the stories I 
uncovered in the book,

1592
01:31:23,991 --> 01:31:24,824
which is an argument that I make is 
based on the work of a graduate student 

1593
01:31:29,421 --> 01:31:33,540
I knew at the University of Montana,
his name is John Hall and he was doing a

1594
01:31:34,110 --> 01:31:39,080
dissertation in history on a,
what he was calling the great dog war in

1595
01:31:39,081 --> 01:31:41,180
the 19th century and what it was all 
about.

1596
01:31:41,181 --> 01:31:42,014
And the more I dug into it,
I realized this is one of the 

1597
01:31:43,521 --> 01:31:48,500
explanations for why you don't see 
accounts of coyotes in cities much.

1598
01:31:49,010 --> 01:31:50,540
Uh,
even in,

1599
01:31:50,570 --> 01:31:51,403
in La.
I mean the first accounts I've seen of 

1600
01:31:53,651 --> 01:31:56,390
Katie's in La for instance,
during the 19 twenties,

1601
01:31:57,260 --> 01:32:02,260
but it's because in the 19th century,
until about the 18 seventies,

1602
01:32:03,640 --> 01:32:04,473
we let dogs our own pets and packs of 
feral dogs roam through American cities 

1603
01:32:14,110 --> 01:32:14,943
at will.

1604
01:32:15,250 --> 01:32:20,250
And so every city in the United States 
had a large population of feral and sort

1605
01:32:21,371 --> 01:32:25,960
of loosely owned dogs roaming around our
city scapes.

1606
01:32:25,990 --> 01:32:27,980
Pharaoh,
meaning they were totally wild,

1607
01:32:27,981 --> 01:32:30,340
or people would feed them and people 
would feed them.

1608
01:32:30,370 --> 01:32:34,060
I mean,
they were just basically stray dogs that

1609
01:32:34,061 --> 01:32:34,894
would roam the city.
They would find things to scavenge 

1610
01:32:37,151 --> 01:32:37,984
behind restaurants and behind the houses
and they would knock over people's 

1611
01:32:41,740 --> 01:32:45,560
garbage and.
But in the.

1612
01:32:45,870 --> 01:32:48,610
This happened in,
I think in the late 18,

1613
01:32:48,611 --> 01:32:49,444
40 [inaudible] Boston had an epidemic 
one year of rabies attacks from these 

1614
01:32:56,351 --> 01:32:57,184
kinds of wild dogs in the city and so 
Boston began to institute what became 

1615
01:33:03,580 --> 01:33:08,580
our modern system of dog catchers,
dog pound's leash laws,

1616
01:33:10,240 --> 01:33:11,073
doc control,
and it was at the Moma when the Boston 

1617
01:33:16,031 --> 01:33:20,290
model began to spread to Philadelphia,
to New York,

1618
01:33:20,291 --> 01:33:23,710
eventually to New Orleans,
eventually to the cities in California,

1619
01:33:24,130 --> 01:33:27,220
and we sort of instituted this new model
of,

1620
01:33:27,221 --> 01:33:28,054
okay,
a dog is properly meant to be in an 

1621
01:33:31,511 --> 01:33:32,344
enclosed yard on a leash when it's with 
its owner is supposed to be running 

1622
01:33:36,731 --> 01:33:41,500
through the streets with packs of other 
dogs scavenging a garbage and stuff.

1623
01:33:42,160 --> 01:33:42,993
When we did that,
what that in effect did was to open up 

1624
01:33:48,220 --> 01:33:53,220
the niche in American cities for wild 
canids and the wild Canaan that was able

1625
01:33:54,311 --> 01:33:55,144
to take advantage of it was the coyote 
that provided them the opening that 

1626
01:33:59,501 --> 01:34:00,334
hadn't been there before because a 
coyote wandering into a city and the 18 

1627
01:34:05,141 --> 01:34:08,470
sixties or 18 thirties would end up 
being,

1628
01:34:08,530 --> 01:34:09,363
of course assaulted by dogs.
Suddenly all the dogs were put up and 

1629
01:34:13,750 --> 01:34:18,750
that opened up the cities to the arrival
of coyotes in our midst.

1630
01:34:19,930 --> 01:34:20,763
Wow.

1631
01:34:22,670 --> 01:34:23,503
Just the interface between human beings 
and the wild and our interaction with 

1632
01:34:28,181 --> 01:34:33,010
the wild and then to start our ability 
or inability to manipulate it.

1633
01:34:33,011 --> 01:34:33,844
It's just so fascinating to me.
And one of the things that I wanted to 

1634
01:34:35,921 --> 01:34:38,110
talk to you about is what they're trying
to do right now,

1635
01:34:38,260 --> 01:34:39,093
uh,
in I guess it's Wyoming and parts of 

1636
01:34:41,321 --> 01:34:42,460
Montana,
this,

1637
01:34:42,461 --> 01:34:44,500
uh,
American Serengeti Project.

1638
01:34:45,090 --> 01:34:48,340
Now we please explain that.
Well,

1639
01:34:48,390 --> 01:34:50,530
uh,
so this,

1640
01:34:50,630 --> 01:34:54,880
this other book that we've,
we've talked about some of mine that has

1641
01:34:54,940 --> 01:34:57,040
been out now just about a year.
It came out,

1642
01:34:57,080 --> 01:34:57,980
uh,
last,

1643
01:34:58,300 --> 01:35:01,400
uh,
last March of 2016.

1644
01:35:02,050 --> 01:35:04,400
Um,
that's a book,

1645
01:35:04,401 --> 01:35:05,234
American Serengeti is a book that's 
about the story of the Great Plains and 

1646
01:35:10,041 --> 01:35:15,041
the fact that we had up until about a 
hundred and 25 or 130 years ago in North

1647
01:35:18,800 --> 01:35:19,633
America,
one of the what was widely regarded 

1648
01:35:21,141 --> 01:35:24,860
around the globe as one of the great 
wildlife spectacles of,

1649
01:35:24,950 --> 01:35:25,790
of the world.

1650
01:35:26,420 --> 01:35:27,253
And these enormous herds of bison have a
reemerging wildhorse bands of 

1651
01:35:35,780 --> 01:35:38,330
pronghorns,
maybe 15,

1652
01:35:38,360 --> 01:35:40,850
$18 million pronghorns,
uh,

1653
01:35:40,860 --> 01:35:41,693
not quite as many as bison,
but almost as many a half million gray 

1654
01:35:45,591 --> 01:35:47,510
wolves that were their predators.
Of course,

1655
01:35:47,511 --> 01:35:52,511
coyotes playing the role of Jackals,
a grizzly bears that roamed,

1656
01:35:53,030 --> 01:35:53,863
I mean,
the original range of the grizzly bear 

1657
01:35:54,921 --> 01:35:55,754
was actually out on the plains.
They were all the way out into Kansas 

1658
01:36:00,140 --> 01:36:00,973
and into Nebraska.
And I mean everybody saw the movie 

1659
01:36:04,611 --> 01:36:06,530
revenant of course.
Uh,

1660
01:36:06,560 --> 01:36:09,170
which the filmmaker said in the rocky 
mountains.

1661
01:36:09,171 --> 01:36:12,020
But that was based on an actual event 
that happened in history.

1662
01:36:12,540 --> 01:36:13,373
A guy named Hugh glass getting mauled by
a grizzly that happened in South Dakota 

1663
01:36:17,060 --> 01:36:17,893
though,
not up in the mountains because the 

1664
01:36:20,361 --> 01:36:21,194
grizzlies were out on the plains in this
version of the Serengeti that prevailed 

1665
01:36:26,120 --> 01:36:26,953
a 150 years ago.
But we ended up basically a wiping all 

1666
01:36:34,030 --> 01:36:35,030
those animals out.

1667
01:36:35,180 --> 01:36:35,690
I mean,
we,

1668
01:36:35,690 --> 01:36:40,690
we wiped out probably as many as 30 
million bison through the 19th century.

1669
01:36:40,760 --> 01:36:41,593
Almost all.
We got the prom horns down from 15 

1670
01:36:44,180 --> 01:36:46,640
million to about 13,000.
Uh,

1671
01:36:46,670 --> 01:36:47,503
we drove the elk off the great plains.
That was their primary range was the 

1672
01:36:51,261 --> 01:36:52,094
planes.
We drove them off and up into the 

1673
01:36:53,001 --> 01:36:55,430
mountains.
Did the same thing with the grizzlies.

1674
01:36:55,820 --> 01:36:59,900
So we basically reduced this,
this American Serengeti,

1675
01:36:59,930 --> 01:37:00,763
which Africa didn't do with its 
Serengeti or it's [inaudible] or it's 

1676
01:37:04,311 --> 01:37:06,380
veiled.
It preserved all.

1677
01:37:06,381 --> 01:37:07,214
It's great animals,
but we destroyed hours and ended up not 

1678
01:37:13,880 --> 01:37:14,713
ever successfully creating any kind of 
wildlife preserve to sort of save at 

1679
01:37:19,641 --> 01:37:21,350
least a part of it.
I mean,

1680
01:37:21,890 --> 01:37:25,250
we got yellowstone,
but of course yellowstone is said in the

1681
01:37:25,280 --> 01:37:26,113
rocky mountains.
And so what this American prairie 

1682
01:37:29,601 --> 01:37:33,020
reserve is about now,
it's based in Bozeman,

1683
01:37:33,021 --> 01:37:35,990
Montana.
It's only about a dozen years old,

1684
01:37:36,590 --> 01:37:41,360
but it's been pretty wildly successful 
in trying to do this.

1685
01:37:42,320 --> 01:37:43,153
It's had the imagination.
This group of people has had the 

1686
01:37:46,641 --> 01:37:51,641
imagination to try to recreate this 
American Serengeti that we are.

1687
01:37:53,180 --> 01:37:55,920
Our government in our state craft never 
did preserve

1688
01:37:56,000 --> 01:38:01,000
forests and so what they've got in mind 
in central Montana is taking a couple of

1689
01:38:02,740 --> 01:38:06,510
large pieces of of existing public 
lands.

1690
01:38:06,900 --> 01:38:07,733
One is the Missouri River Breaks 
National Monument that Bill Clinton 

1691
01:38:11,401 --> 01:38:12,234
created a all along the Missouri River 
and then just downstream of it still 

1692
01:38:16,531 --> 01:38:21,360
along the Missouri River is the Charles 
m russell national wildlife refuge.

1693
01:38:22,080 --> 01:38:22,913
And together those two public lands that
are along the Missouri River and mostly 

1694
01:38:27,930 --> 01:38:31,440
on the South Bank of the Missouri River 
in central Montana,

1695
01:38:32,650 --> 01:38:37,350
make up about one point six,
one point 7 million acres.

1696
01:38:37,860 --> 01:38:42,210
And what American prairie reserve is 
trying to do is to,

1697
01:38:42,270 --> 01:38:43,103
as they come up for sale,
to acquire the private ranches on the 

1698
01:38:47,941 --> 01:38:52,941
north side of the river,
with the idea of ultimately creating a,

1699
01:38:54,500 --> 01:38:55,333
a preserved that's going to be maybe as 
big as twice the size of yellowstone 

1700
01:38:59,581 --> 01:39:00,414
yellowstone's,
a little more than 2 million acres and 

1701
01:39:01,831 --> 01:39:02,664
American prairie reserve is shooting for
a preserve that would be something like 

1702
01:39:05,731 --> 01:39:10,731
4 million acres with the idea of 
recreating this American Serengeti,

1703
01:39:12,000 --> 01:39:16,860
of repopulating it with Bison pronghorns
with elk,

1704
01:39:16,861 --> 01:39:19,050
with big horn sheep,
with mule deer.

1705
01:39:19,050 --> 01:39:19,883
All the animals that were there.
And then because they're a private 

1706
01:39:22,801 --> 01:39:25,500
entity and they,
it's not the fish and wildlife service,

1707
01:39:25,501 --> 01:39:30,501
so they can't on their own merits,
reintroduce wolves or grizzly bears.

1708
01:39:31,140 --> 01:39:31,973
Just sort of sitting back and hoping and
letting wolves come out of the nearby 

1709
01:39:38,701 --> 01:39:43,470
rockies and grizzlies,
which every spring now are coming out of

1710
01:39:43,471 --> 01:39:44,490
the,
uh,

1711
01:39:44,550 --> 01:39:45,383
the rocky mountain front and Montana and
getting out sometimes as much as 100 

1712
01:39:48,511 --> 01:39:49,344
miles out into the plains.
What the American prairie reserve wants 

1713
01:39:52,051 --> 01:39:56,820
to happen is for these animals to get 
all the way out to this preserve,

1714
01:39:56,880 --> 01:39:57,713
find this,
recreated American Serengeti with all 

1715
01:40:01,081 --> 01:40:01,914
the animals that were there and give us 
in our own time and the 21st century 

1716
01:40:07,080 --> 01:40:12,080
this chance to not just read about this 
in history are maybe see some version of

1717
01:40:14,281 --> 01:40:15,114
it on a late night old western movie,
but actually to experience it ourselves 

1718
01:40:19,440 --> 01:40:20,273
now,
how are they going to reintroduce these 

1719
01:40:20,761 --> 01:40:22,020
animals and where they going to get them
from?

1720
01:40:22,440 --> 01:40:23,190
Well,
I mean,

1721
01:40:23,190 --> 01:40:27,270
getting the Bison is not too difficult 
because their surplus bison,

1722
01:40:27,360 --> 01:40:29,210
I'm pretty much around,
uh,

1723
01:40:29,280 --> 01:40:30,113
most of the West.
I mean we've got a larger bison 

1724
01:40:32,221 --> 01:40:36,390
population in North America right now 
than we've had since the 18 nineties.

1725
01:40:37,230 --> 01:40:38,063
More than 300,000 of them.
So it's fairly easy to come up with 

1726
01:40:40,951 --> 01:40:44,640
bison.
Pronghorns are already there.

1727
01:40:45,090 --> 01:40:45,923
Uh,
and so all you have to do is just sort 

1728
01:40:47,191 --> 01:40:51,390
of make conditions,
uh,

1729
01:40:51,420 --> 01:40:53,710
beneficial for their herds to grow.

1730
01:40:54,100 --> 01:40:56,740
Same thing with mule deer,
with elk,

1731
01:40:56,920 --> 01:40:57,753
with big horns,
they're going that they'll have to 

1732
01:40:58,871 --> 01:41:01,360
reintroduce big horns.
But that was an original range.

1733
01:41:01,361 --> 01:41:04,780
There were big horns out on the,
in the badlands of the great plains.

1734
01:41:05,500 --> 01:41:06,640
And then,
as I said,

1735
01:41:06,641 --> 01:41:07,474
they can't deliberately on their own 
reintroduce gray wolves or grizzly 

1736
01:41:12,281 --> 01:41:16,870
bears,
but they're a idea is that if wolves and

1737
01:41:16,871 --> 01:41:19,210
grizzlies get there,
then they're welcome.

1738
01:41:19,780 --> 01:41:23,410
And,
and the idea is they probably wants this

1739
01:41:23,830 --> 01:41:24,663
preserve exists with all these grazing 
animals that the wolves and the bears 

1740
01:41:28,841 --> 01:41:29,890
will,
will find it.

1741
01:41:30,220 --> 01:41:31,720
Wow.
That's so fascinating.

1742
01:41:31,780 --> 01:41:34,900
And now do they have a timeline?
They're trying to accomplish this in,

1743
01:41:34,990 --> 01:41:36,260
you know,
it's a,

1744
01:41:36,490 --> 01:41:37,323
as I said,
they've been around for about 10 or 12 

1745
01:41:39,071 --> 01:41:39,904
years now.
I mean they've raised more than $130 

1746
01:41:42,681 --> 01:41:43,514
million dollars and they've got major 
donors on both the coasts along with 

1747
01:41:48,071 --> 01:41:49,120
lots of,
you know,

1748
01:41:49,160 --> 01:41:53,650
just people like you and me who give 
them 10 and $15 or $25.

1749
01:41:54,260 --> 01:41:57,820
I've got lots of friends who,
once I sort of alerted them to this,

1750
01:41:57,821 --> 01:42:00,600
who have joined American prairie reserve
and our,

1751
01:42:00,650 --> 01:42:02,440
and our donors,
small donors.

1752
01:42:03,000 --> 01:42:03,833
Um,
the timeline is basically whenever they 

1753
01:42:07,541 --> 01:42:09,370
can make it happen.
I mean,

1754
01:42:09,500 --> 01:42:11,020
the,
there's some,

1755
01:42:11,140 --> 01:42:14,860
a considerable resistance from the 
ranching community,

1756
01:42:15,460 --> 01:42:16,293
uh,
not only in Montana but kind of across 

1757
01:42:18,461 --> 01:42:19,294
the West because ranchers don't want to 
see Bison and especially by sudden 

1758
01:42:24,341 --> 01:42:25,174
predators replace cattle herds,
so there's kind of an ideological 

1759
01:42:30,041 --> 01:42:32,530
opposition on the part of,
of ranching people,

1760
01:42:32,590 --> 01:42:33,880
but,
and that's two fold,

1761
01:42:33,881 --> 01:42:34,714
right?
It's one because of the food that the 

1762
01:42:37,001 --> 01:42:39,670
bison would eat because the battle for 
resources,

1763
01:42:39,671 --> 01:42:42,190
but also because of brucellosis.
Well,

1764
01:42:42,250 --> 01:42:45,880
brucellosis of courses,
especially in Montana and they explained

1765
01:42:45,881 --> 01:42:49,390
to people that's disease disease,
it's a disease that,

1766
01:42:49,391 --> 01:42:50,224
uh,
that bison and elk have and that if 

1767
01:42:54,820 --> 01:42:59,440
cattle get it,
their beef cannot be sold,

1768
01:42:59,850 --> 01:43:01,870
uh,
in North American markets,

1769
01:43:01,930 --> 01:43:06,070
all beef that's sold in our supermarkets
has to be brucellosis free.

1770
01:43:06,720 --> 01:43:07,553
And how do they determine that?
Do they have to test each individual 

1771
01:43:09,281 --> 01:43:10,540
animal when they swatted them?
Yeah.

1772
01:43:10,541 --> 01:43:12,220
Well,
I mean they would,

1773
01:43:12,221 --> 01:43:13,054
if there was a real threat about it.
The truth is there has never been an 

1774
01:43:16,001 --> 01:43:16,834
instance in the wild of either a bison 
or an elk transferring brucellosis to 

1775
01:43:21,580 --> 01:43:23,500
cattle.
How would they transfer it to the FDA at

1776
01:43:23,501 --> 01:43:26,020
the same food?
Now they basically,

1777
01:43:26,021 --> 01:43:29,920
it comes through a largely from 
afterbirth whenever they,

1778
01:43:30,340 --> 01:43:33,130
uh,
whenever a bison a cow for example,

1779
01:43:33,131 --> 01:43:33,964
that has brucellosis gives birth.
If cattle come through the area a say 

1780
01:43:39,611 --> 01:43:44,611
within a few days and graze the same 
grass where after birth,

1781
01:43:45,190 --> 01:43:46,023
uh,
has been dropped from a brucellosis 

1782
01:43:47,411 --> 01:43:48,244
infected bison,
then the theory is that a cow could get 

1783
01:43:53,061 --> 01:43:56,270
the disease.
It's been made to happen that way.

1784
01:43:56,360 --> 01:43:57,193
And laboratories,
we have no record of it ever having 

1785
01:44:00,321 --> 01:44:02,030
happened in the wild.

1786
01:44:02,440 --> 01:44:04,520
When now when they made it happen in 
laboratories,

1787
01:44:04,521 --> 01:44:08,570
did they force feed the cows?
I don't think so.

1788
01:44:08,571 --> 01:44:10,490
I mean,
but I have to say that I've,

1789
01:44:10,560 --> 01:44:13,340
I've not read the study so I'm not quite
sure how they,

1790
01:44:13,820 --> 01:44:16,010
how they pulled it off,
but they did.

1791
01:44:16,460 --> 01:44:19,730
They did make the transfer happen in a 
laboratory setting.

1792
01:44:20,390 --> 01:44:21,223
Uh,
what's been bizarre about the whole 

1793
01:44:22,431 --> 01:44:23,264
brucellosis thing is that elk are 
infected with brucellosis far more than 

1794
01:44:26,870 --> 01:44:27,703
by center,
but the ranching community doesn't seem 

1795
01:44:29,901 --> 01:44:33,530
to be concerned about elk bison that 
they don't want.

1796
01:44:33,590 --> 01:44:34,910
And why is that?
Well,

1797
01:44:34,911 --> 01:44:35,780
I mean,
part of it,

1798
01:44:35,840 --> 01:44:40,840
it seems to me almost dates back to the 
19th century when we destroyed the,

1799
01:44:41,061 --> 01:44:41,894
uh,
original American Serengeti and killed 

1800
01:44:43,611 --> 01:44:44,444
all these bison and converted the great 
plains into largely a ranching country 

1801
01:44:49,190 --> 01:44:50,023
with cattle.
I mean in the idea has been from the 

1802
01:44:52,551 --> 01:44:53,384
ranching community ever since that bison
are a direct threat to the existing 

1803
01:44:58,701 --> 01:45:03,701
ranching community that if you get too 
many people and namor herd of Bison,

1804
01:45:05,420 --> 01:45:06,920
uh,
you know,

1805
01:45:06,921 --> 01:45:10,160
and I'm not sure I can track the logic 
of their arguments,

1806
01:45:10,161 --> 01:45:13,490
but it somehow seems to lead in that 
direction.

1807
01:45:14,000 --> 01:45:19,000
They don't like people introducing bison
into the middle of a ranching setting,

1808
01:45:22,430 --> 01:45:23,263
particularly what they don't seem to 
like is someone with an old Montana 

1809
01:45:27,951 --> 01:45:32,951
ranch of 40 or 50,000 acres selling that
ranch.

1810
01:45:34,100 --> 01:45:36,500
So somebody like American prairie 
reserve,

1811
01:45:37,040 --> 01:45:37,873
which clearly is going to introduce 
wildlife on it and remove it from as an 

1812
01:45:44,030 --> 01:45:44,863
active sort of livestock ranching.
A economic enterprise is interesting 

1813
01:45:49,491 --> 01:45:53,420
because it's a superior meet to bisons 
better meat and that's a better meat,

1814
01:45:53,421 --> 01:45:55,700
better meat for you,
much less fat in it.

1815
01:45:56,610 --> 01:45:57,410
It's,
yeah,

1816
01:45:57,410 --> 01:46:01,130
it's.
So this is a,

1817
01:46:01,640 --> 01:46:02,473
I think the most exciting conservation 
project that's out in the West in our 

1818
01:46:09,171 --> 01:46:10,240
time.
Uh,

1819
01:46:10,970 --> 01:46:15,080
this is something that we didn't get and
a lot of people don't know that.

1820
01:46:15,081 --> 01:46:15,914
That's kind of why I wrote this American
Serengeti Book because I wanted people 

1821
01:46:18,411 --> 01:46:19,244
to understand that only 120 530 years 
ago we had the equivalent of the Masai 

1822
01:46:25,220 --> 01:46:30,220
Mara in places like Nebraska and South 
Dakota and eastern Montana and wow.

1823
01:46:30,770 --> 01:46:35,270
And we destroyed it.
And just like that and just the space of

1824
01:46:35,300 --> 01:46:37,580
a few decades,
we completely wiped it out.

1825
01:46:37,581 --> 01:46:38,414
And as I said a minute ago,
what seems to me to be the largest 

1826
01:46:41,960 --> 01:46:46,490
destruction wholesale destruction of 
wildlife discoverable in modern history.

1827
01:46:46,820 --> 01:46:50,490
And so right now the American prairie 
reserve is just,

1828
01:46:50,520 --> 01:46:51,353
they're just taking that land and buying
it up and they haven't started this 

1829
01:46:55,501 --> 01:46:57,510
project at now.
They have started the project.

1830
01:46:57,511 --> 01:46:58,344
Yeah,
it certainly exists and I've got a map 

1831
01:46:59,971 --> 01:47:00,804
of it in the,
in the book and American Serengeti and 

1832
01:47:03,331 --> 01:47:06,020
they've reintroduced animals already.
They have reintroduced animals.

1833
01:47:06,030 --> 01:47:10,470
They're trying to come up with 12,000.
So they have an instagram page.

1834
01:47:10,500 --> 01:47:11,190
Look at that.
Yeah.

1835
01:47:11,190 --> 01:47:13,050
American prairie reserve as an instagram
page.

1836
01:47:13,060 --> 01:47:15,120
Absolutely.
Only 1700 followers.

1837
01:47:15,210 --> 01:47:16,043
How dare they.
So click on that picture of the bison 

1838
01:47:18,301 --> 01:47:19,350
down there.
Below that,

1839
01:47:19,770 --> 01:47:21,450
below that Jamie lower right hand 
corner.

1840
01:47:21,900 --> 01:47:23,730
There you go.
Lower right hand corner.

1841
01:47:23,820 --> 01:47:24,720
Yeah,
yeah.

1842
01:47:25,750 --> 01:47:27,120
Look at that.
Oh Wow.

1843
01:47:27,420 --> 01:47:28,920
Interesting.
So,

1844
01:47:28,921 --> 01:47:29,754
um,
there's a lot of bias in there roaming 

1845
01:47:31,171 --> 01:47:33,170
around and this is land that they 
occupied.

1846
01:47:33,171 --> 01:47:34,004
And so these bison have a essentially 
very few predators and they're just 

1847
01:47:38,281 --> 01:47:40,200
wandering around and they're going to 
repopulate.

1848
01:47:40,490 --> 01:47:42,080
We've got to repopulate.
And uh,

1849
01:47:42,120 --> 01:47:44,580
so one of the things that,
uh,

1850
01:47:44,581 --> 01:47:45,414
American prairie reserve does when they 
acquire these ranches is that they 

1851
01:47:49,111 --> 01:47:49,944
remove the fencing from.
I mean they've been fenced of course to 

1852
01:47:52,831 --> 01:47:56,250
create pastures for bison,
but they removed or for cattle,

1853
01:47:56,251 --> 01:47:59,670
but they removed the fencing in order to
let bison roam freely.

1854
01:47:59,940 --> 01:48:00,773
And of course,
the idea is you ultimately have to have 

1855
01:48:03,511 --> 01:48:04,344
the predators back.
You're not going to have a complete 

1856
01:48:06,091 --> 01:48:09,360
ecosystem unless you have the predators 
there as well.

1857
01:48:09,390 --> 01:48:10,530
That is really tricky,
right?

1858
01:48:11,250 --> 01:48:14,100
Because they're not allowed to 
reintroduce grizzly bears.

1859
01:48:14,340 --> 01:48:16,950
They are not allowed to as a private 
organization,

1860
01:48:17,010 --> 01:48:18,870
oh,
the fish and wildlife service would have

1861
01:48:18,871 --> 01:48:21,210
to do this and fish and wildlife service
doesn't actually,

1862
01:48:21,211 --> 01:48:22,044
even the public lands that are there are
not managed by the US fish and wildlife 

1863
01:48:26,671 --> 01:48:27,504
service.
And good luck getting cooperation from 

1864
01:48:29,131 --> 01:48:29,964
people in Montana.
There's still stinging from the wolves 

1865
01:48:31,591 --> 01:48:36,450
being introduced into yellowstone and 
the decimation of the elk population and

1866
01:48:36,451 --> 01:48:38,480
all the other livestock issues that 
they've had there.

1867
01:48:38,510 --> 01:48:39,240
Yeah.
So,

1868
01:48:39,240 --> 01:48:40,073
so they argue,
at least when I was at the last few 

1869
01:48:43,020 --> 01:48:43,853
years I was in Montana,
and this was about 10 years after the 

1870
01:48:46,321 --> 01:48:50,340
wolves had been recovered.
We had about 1700 gray wolves in Montana

1871
01:48:50,430 --> 01:48:52,860
or in the northern rockies actually,
uh,

1872
01:48:52,861 --> 01:48:55,830
by about 2012 or so.
And uh,

1873
01:48:57,360 --> 01:48:58,193
so the hunters in Montana were up in 
arms sort of the way these white tail 

1874
01:49:05,701 --> 01:49:09,450
hunters in South Carolina now are up in 
arms over coyotes.

1875
01:49:09,890 --> 01:49:10,723
The hunters of Montana were up in arms 
because it wasn't so easy to get an elk 

1876
01:49:14,431 --> 01:49:16,140
anymore and they blamed it all on 
wolves.

1877
01:49:16,141 --> 01:49:19,680
And someone from the University of 
Montana did a study of a particular herd

1878
01:49:19,681 --> 01:49:20,514
that had been singled out as one that 
was just being harassed by wolves and 

1879
01:49:23,660 --> 01:49:25,950
you know,
and it was impossible to kill bull there

1880
01:49:25,951 --> 01:49:26,784
anymore and concluded that actually most
of the production that was taking place 

1881
01:49:30,481 --> 01:49:31,314
on that elk herd was from mountain lions
and not the wolves that had been 

1882
01:49:34,591 --> 01:49:35,424
reintroduced,
but it's become the for the hunting 

1883
01:49:38,101 --> 01:49:40,260
community,
the sport hunting community,

1884
01:49:40,620 --> 01:49:41,453
which has had,
of course a century now of getting to 

1885
01:49:44,221 --> 01:49:48,250
hunt elk and white tails and deer and 
everything else

1886
01:49:48,640 --> 01:49:49,473
without competition from predators.
This has become kind of the new excuse 

1887
01:49:54,640 --> 01:49:57,520
of why I didn't get my elk this year.
Right.

1888
01:49:57,521 --> 01:49:59,020
That makes sense.
And then also,

1889
01:49:59,021 --> 01:49:59,854
uh,
I think it's super important that the 

1890
01:50:01,871 --> 01:50:02,704
hunting community step back and 
understand that these animals are 

1891
01:50:04,841 --> 01:50:08,830
supposed to be preyed upon by wolves and
that without them you're going to get to

1892
01:50:08,831 --> 01:50:09,664
these enormous overpopulation,
which had happened in that hundred year 

1893
01:50:13,181 --> 01:50:15,710
period when we were reintroducing elk 
with no predators.

1894
01:50:15,720 --> 01:50:19,150
They develop diseases and Montana has no
shortage of ALC.

1895
01:50:19,151 --> 01:50:19,984
I was there this summer and we drove by 
this house and we had to pull over and 

1896
01:50:23,201 --> 01:50:27,600
luckily I had binoculars in my car and I
gave him my kids and the first time they

1897
01:50:27,630 --> 01:50:29,800
saw elk,
there was a hundred elk on this lawn,

1898
01:50:29,940 --> 01:50:33,250
hundred there were all over the place 
and uh,

1899
01:50:33,280 --> 01:50:34,113
one of the women who lives there was 
explained to us that they had wolves 

1900
01:50:36,131 --> 01:50:36,964
come through just a couple of nights 
before and it was really exciting and 

1901
01:50:39,011 --> 01:50:41,680
everybody's looking out the window and I
think if you live there,

1902
01:50:42,370 --> 01:50:43,960
if you're a person who was an elk 
hunter,

1903
01:50:43,961 --> 01:50:44,794
especially if you're a lazy one,
I get where you could see that that 

1904
01:50:47,230 --> 01:50:50,350
would be something you would complain 
about,

1905
01:50:50,351 --> 01:50:52,660
but think the ELC adapt,
you know,

1906
01:50:52,661 --> 01:50:53,530
they figured it out.

1907
01:50:53,590 --> 01:50:56,560
They don't call as much and people are 
complaining about that.

1908
01:50:56,561 --> 01:50:57,394
You don't hear the bugling as much,
but that bugling was probably a little 

1909
01:51:00,911 --> 01:51:01,744
unnatural.
They get a little too cocky that they 

1910
01:51:02,771 --> 01:51:05,080
could just scream and yell whenever they
were breeding.

1911
01:51:05,710 --> 01:51:07,360
You know,
what they got preyed upon.

1912
01:51:07,450 --> 01:51:08,350
Right.
Well,

1913
01:51:08,351 --> 01:51:09,184
you know,
what we have to remember is that we are 

1914
01:51:11,621 --> 01:51:12,454
newcomers to North America.
This is a very old place and wolves and 

1915
01:51:19,811 --> 01:51:20,644
coyotes and mountain lions have been 
part of the ecological equation here 

1916
01:51:26,350 --> 01:51:29,710
with all of these animals that we like 
to hunt with pronghorns,

1917
01:51:29,711 --> 01:51:31,090
with elk,
with mule deer.

1918
01:51:31,320 --> 01:51:32,153
I mean this is,
they've been evolving with one another 

1919
01:51:34,750 --> 01:51:38,980
for hundreds of thousands of years.
I mean pronghorns,

1920
01:51:38,981 --> 01:51:41,050
I talk about this and the American 
Serengeti book,

1921
01:51:42,100 --> 01:51:42,933
pronghorn females always have two fonts.
They basically have little litters of 

1922
01:51:49,571 --> 01:51:54,571
two and the reason they have to is 
because coyotes prey on pronghorn funds.

1923
01:51:55,330 --> 01:52:00,090
And so you basically have an heir and a 
spare and the spares,

1924
01:52:00,130 --> 01:52:02,620
the one that you assumed the coyotes are
going to get.

1925
01:52:02,710 --> 01:52:03,730
Wow.
So,

1926
01:52:03,780 --> 01:52:06,320
and they evolve disability,
you know,

1927
01:52:06,340 --> 01:52:07,173
hundreds of thousands of years ago.
So I think part of it is just coming to 

1928
01:52:10,661 --> 01:52:15,661
terms with the fact that we're,
we're brand new here and it's gonna take

1929
01:52:17,380 --> 01:52:22,060
awhile for us to actually truly become 
Americans in an ecological sense.

1930
01:52:22,061 --> 01:52:22,894
In one way to do it is to think in terms
of these long patterns that extinct 

1931
01:52:26,560 --> 01:52:27,393
stand back through time.
I want to talk to you about your paper 

1932
01:52:29,470 --> 01:52:34,270
on Bison is called Bison diplomacy and 
bison ecology or is it the opposite?

1933
01:52:35,370 --> 01:52:37,400
Bison ecology.
Diplomacy.

1934
01:52:37,420 --> 01:52:38,253
Yeah.
Yeah.

1935
01:52:38,350 --> 01:52:39,183
And what you were saying was,
and this I found incredibly fascinating 

1936
01:52:43,150 --> 01:52:46,100
was that when we came along,
when the mark,

1937
01:52:46,101 --> 01:52:48,590
I say we obviously my grandparents were 
immigrants,

1938
01:52:48,640 --> 01:52:52,190
wasn't me,
but when Europeans,

1939
01:52:52,220 --> 01:52:53,053
when you know,
people that we consider Americans now 

1940
01:52:54,921 --> 01:52:55,754
came along a few hundred years ago,
and then when they started doing the 

1941
01:52:58,791 --> 01:53:00,470
market hunting and killing off all the 
bison,

1942
01:53:00,880 --> 01:53:01,713
well,
we had done was something that the 

1943
01:53:03,741 --> 01:53:06,230
native Americans were already on their 
way to doing.

1944
01:53:08,180 --> 01:53:09,760
Well,
I mean,

1945
01:53:10,070 --> 01:53:13,640
so let me,
let me sort of offer a revision of that.

1946
01:53:13,670 --> 01:53:14,540
Okay.
Um,

1947
01:53:15,380 --> 01:53:19,190
native people and Bison,
uh,

1948
01:53:19,550 --> 01:53:24,240
had coexisted in that had been going on 
for eight or 9,000 years with,

1949
01:53:24,330 --> 01:53:26,660
with the,
the modern bison.

1950
01:53:26,690 --> 01:53:28,250
I mean,
if you track it back to,

1951
01:53:28,870 --> 01:53:31,640
you know,
the large Pleistocene Bison,

1952
01:53:31,641 --> 01:53:34,460
bison,
antiquity and bison latter fronds,

1953
01:53:34,470 --> 01:53:36,980
the big Longhorn Bison Longhorn.
Bison,

1954
01:53:37,190 --> 01:53:38,180
what is that?
Oh,

1955
01:53:38,190 --> 01:53:39,023
amy.
Yeah.

1956
01:53:39,050 --> 01:53:43,160
It was by some Latin frons.
It's called Lana frons.

1957
01:53:43,490 --> 01:53:44,880
Frons.
Yeah.

1958
01:53:45,230 --> 01:53:46,063
And so it's a long horn bison.
And then there was a slightly smaller 

1959
01:53:50,391 --> 01:53:55,391
one that existed farther into into our 
own time or the bison that we experience

1960
01:53:56,390 --> 01:53:59,450
any of these pure.
Well,

1961
01:53:59,780 --> 01:54:01,070
some herds are.
Wow.

1962
01:54:01,071 --> 01:54:03,080
Look at that thing.
That's amazing.

1963
01:54:03,200 --> 01:54:04,620
Yeah.
So that's,

1964
01:54:04,870 --> 01:54:06,130
that's bias.
A lot of fraud.

1965
01:54:06,140 --> 01:54:06,973
I'm sure you're aware of the scrub bowls
like particularly in Australia with 

1966
01:54:10,101 --> 01:54:10,934
these animals get free and they become 
feral domestic cows change their 

1967
01:54:14,781 --> 01:54:17,480
characteristics,
look at the size of that thing.

1968
01:54:17,990 --> 01:54:19,570
So what the Lord.
Yeah.

1969
01:54:19,750 --> 01:54:24,750
So what that graphic shows is the 
contemporary are bison over on the right

1970
01:54:27,951 --> 01:54:32,951
side of the graphic and you can see how 
much smaller it is than the animals that

1971
01:54:33,531 --> 01:54:34,364
were here during the pleistocene by some
latter fronds as the animal over on the 

1972
01:54:38,751 --> 01:54:39,584
far left.
And Bison antiquity is one of these in 

1973
01:54:43,431 --> 01:54:44,264
the middle.
It's probably the very middle one right 

1974
01:54:45,531 --> 01:54:49,850
there.
These animals were hunted by early human

1975
01:54:49,851 --> 01:54:50,684
hunters here too when the plot,
because they arrived before the 

1976
01:54:52,851 --> 01:54:55,580
pleistocene produced that extinction 
scenario.

1977
01:54:55,820 --> 01:55:00,080
So they hunted these,
these large forms of Bison,

1978
01:55:00,081 --> 01:55:03,110
but about 8,000 years ago,
Bison,

1979
01:55:04,190 --> 01:55:09,190
the large ones having become extinct.
Bison sort of evolved into this smaller.

1980
01:55:10,460 --> 01:55:11,293
I mean some people actually refer to the
Modern Boston as a dwarf complex 

1981
01:55:14,660 --> 01:55:19,130
compared to these older ones.
And so what I argue,

1982
01:55:19,131 --> 01:55:19,964
and I've got a chapter on this and 
American Serengeti to Sorta my most 

1983
01:55:23,361 --> 01:55:27,320
recent take on this bison ecology bison 
diplomacy piece,

1984
01:55:27,321 --> 01:55:31,760
which came out in a very fancy,
a journal Academic Journal,

1985
01:55:31,780 --> 01:55:33,440
but 25 years ago now.

1986
01:55:33,980 --> 01:55:34,813
But what I argue is that that hunt had 
been going on for 8,000 years and 

1987
01:55:43,170 --> 01:55:44,003
probably the reason that bison never 
that Indians never hunted them to 

1988
01:55:48,631 --> 01:55:49,464
extinction is because bison were 
actually better adapted to the 

1989
01:55:53,221 --> 01:55:54,054
grasslands than people were.
So they were more successful as a 

1990
01:55:58,321 --> 01:55:59,154
grassland species than humans were.
Until we get the introduction from the 

1991
01:56:06,541 --> 01:56:10,290
European arrival of a couple of things 
that change the equation.

1992
01:56:10,350 --> 01:56:14,910
One is the reintroduction of the horse 
to North America,

1993
01:56:14,970 --> 01:56:19,970
which native people in the west quickly 
take up and gives him a bill.

1994
01:56:20,220 --> 01:56:21,053
An ability to hunt bison far more 
efficiently and to become just as well 

1995
01:56:24,931 --> 01:56:28,230
adapted to life on the grasslands as the
as the bison was.

1996
01:56:29,190 --> 01:56:30,023
But the other thing that changes the 
equation is the market and the 

1997
01:56:32,911 --> 01:56:37,911
introduction of the market economy.
And so what that article actually argued

1998
01:56:38,011 --> 01:56:43,011
and what my chapter in American 
Serengeti argues to I haven't changed my

1999
01:56:43,171 --> 01:56:44,004
mind over the last 25 years about this,
is that the market became a force for 

2000
01:56:54,510 --> 01:56:59,510
native people just as it did for people 
all around the world in Africa and India

2001
01:57:00,301 --> 01:57:03,990
and everywhere else that they found 
difficult to resist.

2002
01:57:04,530 --> 01:57:08,490
And one of the primary reasons they 
found it difficult to resist was because

2003
01:57:09,480 --> 01:57:11,580
if you were hunting with flint 
arrowheads,

2004
01:57:12,150 --> 01:57:17,150
your best arrowhead maker could maybe 
produce 15 of them through hard labor in

2005
01:57:19,561 --> 01:57:20,394
a day.
But you could go out and kill a bison 

2006
01:57:26,610 --> 01:57:31,610
and have your wife Tan.
It's pelt and make a robe.

2007
01:57:32,581 --> 01:57:33,414
A softly tan robe out of it.
And you could trade that to a white 

2008
01:57:37,951 --> 01:57:38,784
trader from the Hudson's Bay company or 
the American fur company and they would 

2009
01:57:43,891 --> 01:57:48,891
give you a hundred and 50 steel 
arrowheads that were far better than the

2010
01:57:50,911 --> 01:57:55,911
flint ones that took your best arrow 
maker a day to produce and you could get

2011
01:57:56,540 --> 01:58:01,540
150 of them for the work of 30 minutes 
going out and shooting a bison.

2012
01:58:03,360 --> 01:58:06,810
And of course your wife had to spend a 
week working on the pill.

2013
01:58:07,350 --> 01:58:12,350
But basically the European market had so
many labor saving technologies,

2014
01:58:19,260 --> 01:58:21,840
steel arrowheads,
steel knives,

2015
01:58:21,841 --> 01:58:22,674
steel hatchets,
a firearms that it became almost 

2016
01:58:29,821 --> 01:58:34,821
impossible for Indian people to resist 
trading for those things.

2017
01:58:36,450 --> 01:58:38,460
I mean,
and if you didn't trade for them and the

2018
01:58:38,640 --> 01:58:39,473
tribe down the river did,
then they suddenly had guns and you 

2019
01:58:43,121 --> 01:58:45,940
didn't.
And so you were going to be out competed

2020
01:58:45,941 --> 01:58:48,700
by your neighbors.
And so in effect,

2021
01:58:48,701 --> 01:58:49,534
what happened was at the lure of the 
goods of the industrial world in the 

2022
01:58:53,931 --> 01:58:54,764
market economy,
drew Indian people into the market hunt 

2023
01:58:58,720 --> 01:59:01,690
so that by the 18,
20,

2024
01:59:01,740 --> 01:59:03,460
18 thirties,
18 forties,

2025
01:59:03,610 --> 01:59:04,443
they were still killing buffalo.
In order to provide meat for the family 

2026
01:59:08,021 --> 01:59:09,430
and to provide,
you know,

2027
01:59:09,480 --> 01:59:10,313
a hides to make a teepee and all that,
but they were killing and additional 

2028
01:59:14,470 --> 01:59:18,550
percentage of animals to trade to the 
European market.

2029
01:59:18,970 --> 01:59:19,803
And so they became actors in the market 
economy that was basically wiping all 

2030
01:59:25,100 --> 01:59:29,770
these animals out.
So he also was the reintroduction of the

2031
01:59:29,771 --> 01:59:30,820
horse as well,
right?

2032
01:59:30,880 --> 01:59:31,713
Because I was in before that they were 
hunting these animals on foot and they 

2033
01:59:34,181 --> 01:59:35,380
were far less effective.

2034
01:59:35,410 --> 01:59:36,520
Yeah.
Yeah.

2035
01:59:36,521 --> 01:59:37,240
And they,
they're,

2036
01:59:37,240 --> 01:59:38,073
they're beasts of burden was the dog.
And so you couldn't travel nearly as 

2037
01:59:43,301 --> 01:59:44,134
far,
obviously by using dog propelled 

2038
01:59:46,870 --> 01:59:49,690
locomotion as you could horses,
uh,

2039
01:59:49,691 --> 01:59:53,140
and you couldn't carry the kind of 
burdens,

2040
01:59:53,141 --> 01:59:57,010
that kind of goods that you could carry 
on dogs that you could with horses.

2041
01:59:57,011 --> 02:00:02,011
And so the transformation from being a 
dog propelled people to being a horse.

2042
02:00:02,561 --> 02:00:07,060
Propel people was a,
it was a revolution in their lives.

2043
02:00:07,061 --> 02:00:07,894
I mean,
in one of the things that happened as a 

2044
02:00:09,071 --> 02:00:10,240
result of it,
what was it?

2045
02:00:10,840 --> 02:00:14,590
There were people all around the borders
of the plains,

2046
02:00:14,830 --> 02:00:15,663
many of whom were agriculturalists,
who are farmers who ended up especially 

2047
02:00:21,491 --> 02:00:26,491
their young men,
ended up abandoning farming because they

2048
02:00:28,721 --> 02:00:29,554
realized that the potential for rising 
and status and for creating a better 

2049
02:00:35,021 --> 02:00:35,854
life was much higher if you match it up 
on a horse and rode out into the plains 

2050
02:00:38,921 --> 02:00:39,754
and hunted buffalo.

2051
02:00:40,570 --> 02:00:42,390
And so,
I mean,

2052
02:00:42,400 --> 02:00:47,400
there were entire groups like the crows 
had been relatives of demand.

2053
02:00:47,410 --> 02:00:48,243
Dan's in the adult says,
and had been agriculturalists and that 

2054
02:00:50,950 --> 02:00:53,090
entire group of people,
uh,

2055
02:00:53,650 --> 02:00:57,250
ended up abandoning farming,
mattered up on horses,

2056
02:00:57,251 --> 02:00:59,110
rode down to the planes,
become buffalo hunters.

2057
02:00:59,470 --> 02:01:00,303
I mean,
during the period from basically about 

2058
02:01:01,841 --> 02:01:03,400
17,
20,

2059
02:01:03,640 --> 02:01:06,850
when a lot of the people in the west 
began to acquire horses.

2060
02:01:06,851 --> 02:01:07,684
And the,
the,

2061
02:01:07,840 --> 02:01:09,400
what?
Spread horses,

2062
02:01:09,790 --> 02:01:12,760
as I mentioned earlier in our 
conversation,

2063
02:01:12,761 --> 02:01:15,160
was basically in 16,
80,

2064
02:01:15,910 --> 02:01:16,743
the Pueblo Indians down in New Mexico 
rose up against the Spanish colonists 

2065
02:01:22,630 --> 02:01:26,140
and drove them out of New Mexico.
And in the process,

2066
02:01:26,560 --> 02:01:29,320
they captured all their herds of 
livestock.

2067
02:01:29,410 --> 02:01:30,243
They captured their goats,
their sheep and their horse hurts and 

2068
02:01:34,451 --> 02:01:35,284
some animals.
Some of the horses got loose and it's 

2069
02:01:37,261 --> 02:01:38,094
sort of the origin,
at least one of the origins of the wild 

2070
02:01:39,921 --> 02:01:41,540
horses that spread across the West.

2071
02:01:42,320 --> 02:01:43,153
But the Pueblo Indians trade the sheep 
and the goats to the people who become 

2072
02:01:46,851 --> 02:01:47,684
the Navajos.
They become herders of goats and sheep 

2073
02:01:49,910 --> 02:01:50,743
and they start trading the horses,
which they have now in great surplus 

2074
02:01:54,291 --> 02:01:55,124
that they've liberated from the 
Spaniards up the mountains from one 

2075
02:01:58,011 --> 02:01:59,720
tribe to another,
to the youth,

2076
02:01:59,750 --> 02:02:01,700
to the shoney's,
to the Nez perce,

2077
02:02:01,701 --> 02:02:03,280
to the black feet,
uh,

2078
02:02:03,290 --> 02:02:06,350
to the essential ones.
And then on out on the plains.

2079
02:02:06,351 --> 02:02:09,890
And so from a 16,
80 through about 17,

2080
02:02:09,891 --> 02:02:12,560
20 or 70 slash 30,
just about everybody in the west ends up

2081
02:02:12,561 --> 02:02:15,950
getting horses.
And you have to have the culture with it

2082
02:02:15,951 --> 02:02:16,401
too.
I mean,

2083
02:02:16,401 --> 02:02:19,070
you can't just hand the animal over to 
somebody.

2084
02:02:19,071 --> 02:02:19,904
And there's a famous story where the 
first horse that the blackfeet say they 

2085
02:02:24,051 --> 02:02:29,051
offer it buffalo meat to eight.
And somebody has to say as a Kalispell,

2086
02:02:30,051 --> 02:02:31,490
Indiana,
who's riding the horses?

2087
02:02:31,530 --> 02:02:32,240
No,
no,

2088
02:02:32,240 --> 02:02:34,640
not buffalo meat.
It eats grass.

2089
02:02:34,700 --> 02:02:37,130
It grazes on.
You have to feed it grass.

2090
02:02:37,580 --> 02:02:38,413
And they have to be shown how to take 
care of horses and how to Gal stallions 

2091
02:02:42,681 --> 02:02:46,160
and how to ride them and how to break 
them and the whole bit.

2092
02:02:46,161 --> 02:02:50,780
So there's a culture that goes with it,
but once they acquire them,

2093
02:02:51,290 --> 02:02:52,123
and this period that only lasts for 
about 200 years of the famous horse 

2094
02:02:56,661 --> 02:02:59,600
mounted buffalo hunting plains Indian 
emerges,

2095
02:03:00,110 --> 02:03:00,943
that lifestyle becomes,
which is kind of a backward step really 

2096
02:03:03,981 --> 02:03:06,380
in anthropological terms.
You assume that,

2097
02:03:06,410 --> 02:03:07,243
you know,
you go from hunting to be in farmer and 

2098
02:03:08,871 --> 02:03:11,150
you go from farmer to being a city 
dweller.

2099
02:03:11,570 --> 02:03:12,403
This is a step going back the other way,
but it proved to be so compelling to so 

2100
02:03:17,481 --> 02:03:19,760
many people,
as I said earlier,

2101
02:03:19,970 --> 02:03:20,803
especially young men who often in these 
farming communities didn't have much 

2102
02:03:24,201 --> 02:03:25,034
opportunity for upward mobility,
but you can mount up on that horse and 

2103
02:03:28,791 --> 02:03:31,250
ride out and become buffalo hunter and 
men,

2104
02:03:31,550 --> 02:03:33,380
you know,
the world was your oyster.

2105
02:03:33,610 --> 02:03:34,443
Wow.
So was essentially the influence of the 

2106
02:03:35,601 --> 02:03:40,601
Europeans coming here and offering up 
the market and creating this environment

2107
02:03:40,611 --> 02:03:44,240
where they were.
It was really profitable now and so.

2108
02:03:44,300 --> 02:03:48,680
And it became kind of something that 
native people almost couldn't escape.

2109
02:03:49,190 --> 02:03:51,020
You couldn't get away from it because I 
mean,

2110
02:03:51,021 --> 02:03:52,250
there were some groups that said,
okay,

2111
02:03:52,251 --> 02:03:54,020
we're not going to participate in this,
you know,

2112
02:03:54,470 --> 02:03:55,303
but that immediately disadvantaged them 
compared to the group right down the 

2113
02:04:00,141 --> 02:04:03,920
river.
And so people who didn't participate,

2114
02:04:03,921 --> 02:04:04,754
we're pretty quickly overrun by the 
people who became fully engaged in the 

2115
02:04:10,011 --> 02:04:14,870
horse hunt and the market hunt.
And I mean there are instances where,

2116
02:04:14,871 --> 02:04:17,450
I mean like the,
the Su and people,

2117
02:04:17,510 --> 02:04:18,620
you know,
in the movies,

2118
02:04:18,650 --> 02:04:19,483
the Lakotas,
I mean they basically march across the 

2119
02:04:22,010 --> 02:04:23,720
northern West,
like pac man,

2120
02:04:24,140 --> 02:04:24,973
once they acquire horses,
they come out of Minnesota and out of 

2121
02:04:27,411 --> 02:04:28,244
the woodlands and March across the West,
gobbling up one tribe after another and 

2122
02:04:31,911 --> 02:04:34,370
taking away their buffalo hunting 
territory.

2123
02:04:34,850 --> 02:04:36,980
I mean,
they're still doing it down to the time,

2124
02:04:37,050 --> 02:04:37,883
the battle of the little big horn.
That's why the crow's feet on the side 

2125
02:04:40,681 --> 02:04:41,514
of the United States at the battle of 
little big horn is because the lakotas 

2126
02:04:46,440 --> 02:04:47,273
are seizing their countryside.
The Go Lakota is what they call 

2127
02:04:51,001 --> 02:04:53,690
themselves and other native Americans 
call them the Su,

2128
02:04:53,790 --> 02:04:58,200
which means enemy and the word that 
we've used in history as the Sioux,

2129
02:04:58,350 --> 02:04:59,183
but I mean I'm on the southern plains.
The Comanche's did basically the same 

2130
02:05:02,731 --> 02:05:06,810
thing.
They created this empire that was really

2131
02:05:07,140 --> 02:05:11,100
on a par and able to compete with the 
Spanish empire,

2132
02:05:11,101 --> 02:05:11,934
with the Republic of Texas and even for 
awhile against the United States and 

2133
02:05:16,111 --> 02:05:16,944
they created it around this.
This horse propelled bison hunt that 

2134
02:05:24,001 --> 02:05:24,834
provided goods for the market economy.
Now you were talking about steel 

2135
02:05:29,041 --> 02:05:30,990
arrowheads.
Did they,

2136
02:05:31,280 --> 02:05:36,280
or when did they start using firearms?
While I started using firearms?

2137
02:05:36,630 --> 02:05:37,300
I mean,
I was,

2138
02:05:37,300 --> 02:05:38,133
uh,
an early trade item and it was usually 

2139
02:05:39,871 --> 02:05:40,704
in the very beginning of,
of contact between Europeans and native 

2140
02:05:44,161 --> 02:05:46,380
people.
A firearm was,

2141
02:05:46,550 --> 02:05:49,020
you know,
maybe a couple of them were given to the

2142
02:05:49,170 --> 02:05:52,440
headman to the leaders of particular 
tribe as a status item.

2143
02:05:53,460 --> 02:05:54,293
One time I was an editor on a forum 
anthropological journal called Ethno 

2144
02:06:00,151 --> 02:06:03,690
history.
And my task as a,

2145
02:06:03,760 --> 02:06:05,140
an editor,
I was a cyst,

2146
02:06:05,141 --> 02:06:06,780
an editor,
associate editor or something.

2147
02:06:06,781 --> 02:06:07,614
But my task was to read the the incoming
manuscripts that were submitted for 

2148
02:06:11,521 --> 02:06:13,890
publication,
and one of the ones I read,

2149
02:06:13,920 --> 02:06:18,920
I've never forgotten.
This was an account by a trader in South

2150
02:06:22,710 --> 02:06:27,710
America who was turning his trading post
over to a newly arriving trader.

2151
02:06:29,480 --> 02:06:34,480
I think they were Portuguese.
And so this trader who had experience in

2152
02:06:34,531 --> 02:06:37,440
the area was queried by the new guy,
said,

2153
02:06:37,441 --> 02:06:40,830
so how do I get the Indians to trade 
with me?

2154
02:06:41,880 --> 02:06:46,560
And the guy who had been on the scene 
for a while said nothing to it,

2155
02:06:48,030 --> 02:06:53,030
ride out 15 or 20 miles into the 
wilderness and take a steel ax

2156
02:06:56,510 --> 02:06:57,343
and

2157
02:06:57,660 --> 02:07:00,700
suspended from a rope from the branch of
a tree

2158
02:07:01,770 --> 02:07:03,900
and then leave.
And then

2159
02:07:04,650 --> 02:07:06,990
two weeks,
three weeks later go back.

2160
02:07:08,370 --> 02:07:10,560
And this guy,
this new trader,

2161
02:07:10,620 --> 02:07:11,453
did exactly that.
And he went back two weeks later to the 

2162
02:07:13,621 --> 02:07:14,454
spot that's clearing in the forest and 
the Amazonian forest where he had tied 

2163
02:07:17,911 --> 02:07:22,911
this double bladed steel ax.
And there were hundreds of native people

2164
02:07:23,370 --> 02:07:28,370
gathered around the spot wanting more of
these objects were or have these access.

2165
02:07:31,741 --> 02:07:34,890
Because steel.
I mean there's a famous.

2166
02:07:35,260 --> 02:07:38,710
When Captain Cook first puts off the 
coast,

2167
02:07:38,980 --> 02:07:43,980
off the Waimea coast of Hawaii and the 
Hawaiian people paddle there,

2168
02:07:44,771 --> 02:07:45,604
outriggers out and climb on board his 
ships and immediately start pulling all 

2169
02:07:49,961 --> 02:07:50,794
the nails out of the planking on the 
ship and diving off into the water with 

2170
02:07:55,451 --> 02:07:56,284
the nails because they want metal.
They realized this is such an advantage 

2171
02:08:01,510 --> 02:08:06,510
over the technology that they have.
And so I mean,

2172
02:08:06,790 --> 02:08:11,020
they're willing to trade what?
What do you want for an x?

2173
02:08:11,470 --> 02:08:14,380
Wow,
what do you want for a box of nails?

2174
02:08:14,920 --> 02:08:19,360
So they just let the people know that 
the acs was a thing hanging from a tree,

2175
02:08:19,400 --> 02:08:22,510
leaving for awhile,
let him play with it and go back.

2176
02:08:22,890 --> 02:08:24,340
Yeah.
Wow.

2177
02:08:25,200 --> 02:08:27,610
That's,
that's a mindblower.

2178
02:08:28,030 --> 02:08:33,030
So that's how how native people kind of 
all over the world who hadn't progressed

2179
02:08:34,210 --> 02:08:35,043
to the iron revolution,
to the Iron Age were seduced into the 

2180
02:08:40,241 --> 02:08:41,074
market economy,
is that they were offered items that 

2181
02:08:44,261 --> 02:08:45,094
were so compelling.
And as I have said a couple of times 

2182
02:08:49,031 --> 02:08:49,930
now,
if you.

2183
02:08:49,960 --> 02:08:50,793
If you didn't participate in it,
you kind of within a decade you were 

2184
02:08:54,881 --> 02:08:55,714
disadvantaged because everybody around 
you was going to end up doing it and so 

2185
02:09:00,040 --> 02:09:03,250
you got caught up in it and so that's 
how.

2186
02:09:03,580 --> 02:09:07,780
That's how what I was arguing in Bison 
ecology and vice and diplomacy m and and

2187
02:09:07,790 --> 02:09:08,623
I,
I the argument is slightly revised and 

2188
02:09:11,530 --> 02:09:12,363
American Serengeti,
but it's the same argument and it's 

2189
02:09:14,081 --> 02:09:14,914
become the prevailing argument about 
what happened to bison and the 19th 

2190
02:09:18,221 --> 02:09:19,054
century is we used to think that okay,
they were still 100 million of them by 

2191
02:09:23,230 --> 02:09:24,063
the end of the civil war and then guys 
go out with rifles in the space of 20 

2192
02:09:27,011 --> 02:09:27,250
years.

2193
02:09:27,250 --> 02:09:28,083
They shoot them all down and that's the 
end of it for their tongues and further 

2194
02:09:30,581 --> 02:09:34,810
hides,
but what the story actually is is a much

2195
02:09:34,811 --> 02:09:35,644
more believable and real story that it 
has to do with the introduction of 

2196
02:09:40,901 --> 02:09:41,734
horses which drink water and graze grass
and so that reduces the carrying 

2197
02:09:45,191 --> 02:09:49,300
capacity for Bison wants.
There are two or 3 million horses out on

2198
02:09:49,301 --> 02:09:51,730
the plains.
There can't be as many bison anymore.

2199
02:09:52,390 --> 02:09:53,223
It happens because there is a climate 
downturn in the 1840 [inaudible] for 

2200
02:09:58,031 --> 02:09:58,864
about 15 years.
There's a drought and that reduces the 

2201
02:10:01,151 --> 02:10:04,360
carrying capacity for Bison.
So climate plays a role.

2202
02:10:04,950 --> 02:10:05,783
Um,
we know that diseases like anthrax and 

2203
02:10:10,961 --> 02:10:11,794
ultimately brucellosis get among the 
buffalo herds and those diseases 

2204
02:10:14,921 --> 02:10:15,754
probably got among the buffalo herds 
because oxygen and other animals on the 

2205
02:10:19,271 --> 02:10:20,104
overland trails took these European 
exotic diseases out among the bison 

2206
02:10:24,551 --> 02:10:26,710
herds and infected them with disease.

2207
02:10:27,340 --> 02:10:32,340
And then there is no question that the 
way the market worked it was mean.

2208
02:10:33,020 --> 02:10:35,090
And there's,
of course no regulation of it.

2209
02:10:35,120 --> 02:10:37,700
This is before we ever regulate,
you know,

2210
02:10:37,790 --> 02:10:38,623
we have any environmental regulations.
It's just a free for all capitalist 

2211
02:10:42,731 --> 02:10:44,930
world also.
No refrigeration,

2212
02:10:45,020 --> 02:10:45,853
the refrigeration.
So you had to kill it and eat it within 

2213
02:10:47,811 --> 02:10:49,790
a certain time period.
So the,

2214
02:10:49,850 --> 02:10:50,683
you can find a mate and that and that 
dry climate you can dry it and preserve 

2215
02:10:54,601 --> 02:10:57,350
some of it.
But yeah,

2216
02:10:57,351 --> 02:10:59,900
there's no refrigeration.
So,

2217
02:11:00,620 --> 02:11:01,453
you know,
and I mean there's no refrigeration 

2218
02:11:03,471 --> 02:11:05,420
thing really plays a role in the 
[inaudible],

2219
02:11:05,510 --> 02:11:09,690
the famous buffalo jumps that happen in 
the West because you know,

2220
02:11:09,691 --> 02:11:12,890
you couldn't control how many animals 
were going to go off those jumps.

2221
02:11:12,891 --> 02:11:13,724
And so if you wanted to run 10 off in 
order to provide you with buffalo for 

2222
02:11:18,171 --> 02:11:19,004
the next month and a half,
your tribe of 125 with Buffalo Buffalo 

2223
02:11:22,191 --> 02:11:22,460
jumps.

2224
02:11:22,460 --> 02:11:24,200
Been running them off cliffs running off
cliffs.

2225
02:11:24,201 --> 02:11:28,220
Yeah.
And you wanted to run off 10 and instead

2226
02:11:28,221 --> 02:11:30,710
you got into a herd of,
you know,

2227
02:11:30,830 --> 02:11:31,663
1300,
1300 and they all went off and it even 

2228
02:11:35,840 --> 02:11:38,900
became this thing.
I mean we know about these buffalo jumps

2229
02:11:38,901 --> 02:11:39,734
that people regard.
Indian people regarded this as a 

2230
02:11:41,610 --> 02:11:46,610
stratagem that you don't want to let 
surviving buffalo go out onto the plains

2231
02:11:50,660 --> 02:11:51,493
and inform other buffalo that there's 
this thing called a jump that you want 

2232
02:11:55,431 --> 02:11:56,264
to avoid.
And so that they end up wanting to make 

2233
02:11:58,821 --> 02:11:59,654
sure that they get every single animal 
that you're driving so that you don't 

2234
02:12:03,500 --> 02:12:08,450
have buffalo go off and tell other 
buffalo how this works.

2235
02:12:08,680 --> 02:12:09,513
But it's going to sound crazy,
but it makes you wonder if it was 

2236
02:12:12,170 --> 02:12:13,003
ignorance on their part that the,
these animals could communicate like 

2237
02:12:15,531 --> 02:12:20,531
that or if they had some sort of an 
intuition about how instincts and how,

2238
02:12:22,040 --> 02:12:25,760
how certain fears that animals had were 
developed.

2239
02:12:27,110 --> 02:12:28,130
Well,
I think,

2240
02:12:28,630 --> 02:12:29,430
you know,
and I,

2241
02:12:29,430 --> 02:12:30,263
I spent some time talking about this and
the Buffalo Chapter in American 

2242
02:12:33,561 --> 02:12:35,200
Serengeti,
uh,

2243
02:12:36,560 --> 02:12:41,000
it has to do with what we would call 
native science,

2244
02:12:41,330 --> 02:12:42,163
what you mentioned at the last there 
that they do understand and they've 

2245
02:12:46,671 --> 02:12:49,340
probably seen examples of,
you know,

2246
02:12:49,370 --> 02:12:53,360
an animal learning very quickly how to 
avoid a trap.

2247
02:12:54,980 --> 02:12:55,813
But it also has to do with the cause 
effect explanation that they have for 

2248
02:13:00,231 --> 02:13:05,231
how the world works and the,
they don't have this kind of,

2249
02:13:05,300 --> 02:13:06,133
you know,
Western explanation for this is a cause 

2250
02:13:10,220 --> 02:13:15,220
and this is an effect they have on a 
cause effect relationship to be sure.

2251
02:13:15,381 --> 02:13:18,560
But it explains the world in a different
way.

2252
02:13:19,310 --> 02:13:20,143
And Indian people pretty,
pretty generally believed that bison 

2253
02:13:25,281 --> 02:13:26,114
were a people that they were a family of
animals and they had families that were 

2254
02:13:31,831 --> 02:13:32,664
very similar to the families at any and 
people had and they had a controlling 

2255
02:13:36,810 --> 02:13:37,643
master animal,
sort of a buffalo master who you had to 

2256
02:13:41,551 --> 02:13:42,384
appeal to to get the animals to give 
themselves up to humans for the good of 

2257
02:13:49,650 --> 02:13:50,483
humanity.

2258
02:13:50,880 --> 02:13:55,880
And so the idea was that you had this 
kind of,

2259
02:13:58,020 --> 02:14:00,450
um,
you know,

2260
02:14:00,451 --> 02:14:05,160
a theory or tie to these animals.
It was a tie that we would explain.

2261
02:14:05,161 --> 02:14:06,270
Now looking back on it,
we would say,

2262
02:14:06,271 --> 02:14:07,530
okay,
it's a religious thing.

2263
02:14:07,531 --> 02:14:08,364
This was some sort of spiritual kind of 
understanding of how people and animals 

2264
02:14:13,110 --> 02:14:17,010
interacted with one another.
But it was informed a little bit by kind

2265
02:14:17,011 --> 02:14:22,011
of native scientific observation too.
And I think in particular this one where

2266
02:14:24,120 --> 02:14:26,730
the argument was,
and it's from what I've read,

2267
02:14:26,731 --> 02:14:29,130
it's been,
it was pretty widespread that if you did

2268
02:14:29,131 --> 02:14:29,964
a buffalo jump,
you needed to kill all the animals that 

2269
02:14:31,971 --> 02:14:34,320
went off the jump.
You couldn't let any of them get away.

2270
02:14:34,650 --> 02:14:35,483
I think that probably was more in the 
line of kind of native science because 

2271
02:14:39,631 --> 02:14:40,464
they maybe had observed.
They're being instances where an animal 

2272
02:14:44,011 --> 02:14:47,490
that had gone off a jump and had 
survived.

2273
02:14:48,090 --> 02:14:50,670
The next time you encountered that 
animal.

2274
02:14:50,671 --> 02:14:51,504
It might be particularly marked with a 
white patch on a hip or something and a 

2275
02:14:55,980 --> 02:14:56,813
few months later you saw that particular
animal and another group of Bison and 

2276
02:14:59,671 --> 02:15:00,504
when you try to do a jump,
it led that hurt off in a different 

2277
02:15:02,491 --> 02:15:03,324
direction.
And so I think there was kind of native 

2278
02:15:05,701 --> 02:15:07,420
science in that.
But the.

2279
02:15:07,440 --> 02:15:08,273
You know,
where we got to and talking about this 

2280
02:15:09,901 --> 02:15:10,734
was no refrigeration.
So if you ran 1300 of them off and it's 

2281
02:15:14,641 --> 02:15:15,474
August,
then all you're going to get to do and 

2282
02:15:18,361 --> 02:15:19,194
you've got a group of 125 people.
All you're going to get to do is to 

2283
02:15:21,871 --> 02:15:22,704
basically take the best pieces off about
25 or 30 animals and you're going to 

2284
02:15:29,231 --> 02:15:30,064
lose the rest of it.
Because you can't preserve the meat of 

2285
02:15:32,521 --> 02:15:33,354
all those animals.
So they find these sites where they'd 

2286
02:15:35,121 --> 02:15:37,380
just be masked carcasses or mass bones.

2287
02:15:37,500 --> 02:15:38,400
Oh yeah,
yeah.

2288
02:15:38,440 --> 02:15:42,930
There's a site in Texas,
it's called a bonfire shelter site,

2289
02:15:43,170 --> 02:15:45,810
and the reason it's called that 
anthropologists gave it.

2290
02:15:45,811 --> 02:15:46,644
There are archeologists gave it.
This name is because there was a bison 

2291
02:15:49,831 --> 02:15:50,664
jump that was so big there.
We think about 10,000 years ago during 

2292
02:15:54,931 --> 02:15:55,764
the folsom period that and so many 
animals went off that jump and only a 

2293
02:16:00,600 --> 02:16:01,433
few of them could be harvested by the 
people who did the jump that that big 

2294
02:16:05,191 --> 02:16:06,024
mass of animals sat there and basically 
over two or three weeks of time burst 

2295
02:16:14,311 --> 02:16:19,311
into spontaneous combustion and scorched
the cliff that they had gone off of.

2296
02:16:21,241 --> 02:16:22,074
And so when whites first saw it,
they thought somebody has built a giant 

2297
02:16:27,271 --> 02:16:30,700
bonfire at the of that cliff.
Look at that.

2298
02:16:31,120 --> 02:16:34,300
It's strict a hundred feet up the side 
of the cliff.

2299
02:16:34,770 --> 02:16:35,603
Now,
what archeologists realized about it 

2300
02:16:37,181 --> 02:16:41,140
when they begin investigating it was 
that it had been a huge mass of bison,

2301
02:16:41,141 --> 02:16:41,974
driven off a cliff that had burst in hot
weather and the spontaneous combustion 

2302
02:16:46,631 --> 02:16:48,580
and probably burned for four or five 
days.

2303
02:16:49,660 --> 02:16:51,310
How does that happen?
How did they,

2304
02:16:51,590 --> 02:16:54,130
how do they burst into flames?
Well,

2305
02:16:54,131 --> 02:16:59,131
I mean in hot weather with that much 
decay and fermentation of all the juices

2306
02:16:59,831 --> 02:17:00,664
that are in intestines and stomach,
you basically create a condition where 

2307
02:17:04,121 --> 02:17:07,330
you've got flammable chemistry.
That

2308
02:17:09,220 --> 02:17:13,000
lights put what causes the ignition?
You know,

2309
02:17:13,001 --> 02:17:13,751
who knows?
I mean,

2310
02:17:13,751 --> 02:17:16,840
I think it's the explanation I've read 
is spontaneous,

2311
02:17:16,841 --> 02:17:17,674
but you know,
somebody may have walked over with a 

2312
02:17:19,451 --> 02:17:24,090
torch and tossed it onto the pile of 
animals and burn them.

2313
02:17:24,190 --> 02:17:27,250
Wow.
Thousands of animals.

2314
02:17:27,730 --> 02:17:28,750
Yeah.
Thousands of them.

2315
02:17:29,330 --> 02:17:30,163
You know,
it's interesting where you're talking 

2316
02:17:30,571 --> 02:17:31,404
about with.
I'm explaining this idea that if one of 

2317
02:17:34,921 --> 02:17:37,260
them survived that they would inform the
other ones.

2318
02:17:37,590 --> 02:17:39,750
There was a study that was done recently
on mice,

2319
02:17:40,110 --> 02:17:45,030
and this is a direct genetic study,
so it might not be totally related,

2320
02:17:45,031 --> 02:17:45,864
but it might be in some ways they took 
these mice and they spray to citrus 

2321
02:17:50,611 --> 02:17:51,444
smell in their cage,
and then when they smelled the citrus 

2322
02:17:55,171 --> 02:17:56,490
smell,
they shocked them.

2323
02:17:56,640 --> 02:17:57,473
They shock their feet.
They had the bottom floor of the cage 

2324
02:17:59,851 --> 02:18:00,684
was electrically charged,
and every time they sprayed that citrus 

2325
02:18:04,171 --> 02:18:05,400
smell,
they would give them a zap.

2326
02:18:05,850 --> 02:18:10,470
Then their ancestors who had never 
experienced this before,

2327
02:18:10,860 --> 02:18:13,830
they did the same thing to them,
just sprayed the citrus smell.

2328
02:18:13,860 --> 02:18:18,210
And they had a physical reaction,
a heightened sense of danger,

2329
02:18:18,330 --> 02:18:20,440
fear,
you know,

2330
02:18:20,560 --> 02:18:21,393
they,
they realized that a shock was coming 

2331
02:18:23,370 --> 02:18:25,740
just by the smell that citrus,
they were terrified of it.

2332
02:18:25,870 --> 02:18:28,440
Yeah.
It makes sense that instincts are passed

2333
02:18:28,441 --> 02:18:29,274
on.

2334
02:18:29,330 --> 02:18:30,530
Well,
it does.

2335
02:18:30,620 --> 02:18:31,453
I mean,
we,

2336
02:18:32,240 --> 02:18:36,950
we've sort of concluded from studies 
that have been done primarily in Italy,

2337
02:18:37,000 --> 02:18:37,833
uh,
over,

2338
02:18:38,390 --> 02:18:39,223
uh,
studying families through the 

2339
02:18:41,331 --> 02:18:43,970
generations and Italy that

2340
02:18:47,000 --> 02:18:47,833
descendants of a particular group of 
people will preserve evidence in their 

2341
02:18:53,601 --> 02:18:56,030
jeans sometimes four,
five,

2342
02:18:56,031 --> 02:18:56,864
six generations down.
A timeline of an ancestor who went 

2343
02:19:01,641 --> 02:19:02,474
through a famine or a starving time,
and so that famine would produce a 

2344
02:19:09,291 --> 02:19:10,124
physiological effect on the body and 
that would be passed down so that 

2345
02:19:15,441 --> 02:19:20,441
geneticists could discover effects of it
several generations down the timeline.

2346
02:19:22,490 --> 02:19:25,730
So it's sort of similar to what you're 
describing with,

2347
02:19:26,150 --> 02:19:29,960
with mice and think that's probably,
you know,

2348
02:19:29,961 --> 02:19:30,794
we just said we haven't studied,
at least I'm not aware that there had 

2349
02:19:32,751 --> 02:19:34,730
been a lot of studies of this kind of 
thing,

2350
02:19:34,731 --> 02:19:35,610
but,
uh,

2351
02:19:35,730 --> 02:19:39,200
what it really kind of means is that 
we're the products,

2352
02:19:39,940 --> 02:19:41,170
um,
you know,

2353
02:19:41,180 --> 02:19:42,013
in our modern world of things that 
happened to our ancestors maybe two or 

2354
02:19:45,981 --> 02:19:46,814
300 years ago and maybe even the fears 
like they think that Arachnophobia and 

2355
02:19:50,540 --> 02:19:51,373
video phobia and a lot of the fears of 
snakes and bugs and things that people 

2356
02:19:54,741 --> 02:19:55,574
have might be directly attributed to 
ancestors being bitten or poisoned by 

2357
02:19:58,341 --> 02:19:59,150
those things.

2358
02:19:59,150 --> 02:20:01,820
Or a seeing someone getting bitten or 
poisoned by them.

2359
02:20:02,450 --> 02:20:04,460
I mean,
speaking of that sort of thing.

2360
02:20:04,520 --> 02:20:04,730
And,
uh,

2361
02:20:04,730 --> 02:20:09,020
there's a section I do and when I'm 
talking about the development of poisons

2362
02:20:09,021 --> 02:20:11,540
to try to eradicate coyotes,
uh,

2363
02:20:11,560 --> 02:20:12,490
and the,
uh,

2364
02:20:12,680 --> 02:20:13,513
cody America book where the reason 
during World War II we decided are the 

2365
02:20:19,371 --> 02:20:22,970
government what is now called wildlife 
services,

2366
02:20:23,690 --> 02:20:26,960
um,
this agency that was trying to solve the

2367
02:20:26,961 --> 02:20:29,030
Predator problem by exterminating caio.
He's,

2368
02:20:29,031 --> 02:20:34,031
the reason they used our new chemical 
insights during World War Two to come up

2369
02:20:35,841 --> 02:20:36,674
with new poisons a against coyotes,
was that they began to realize that 

2370
02:20:41,451 --> 02:20:42,284
strychnine,
which had been the poison of preference 

2371
02:20:44,301 --> 02:20:45,134
for the previous 70 or so years,
was a poison that kill coyotes too 

2372
02:20:50,781 --> 02:20:55,781
quickly.
And coyotes are really smart about cause

2373
02:20:55,791 --> 02:21:00,110
and effect.
And so a coyote that was in the presence

2374
02:21:00,111 --> 02:21:05,111
of an animal that ate a bait cube and 
then suddenly went into convulsions.

2375
02:21:06,110 --> 02:21:06,943
And strychnine produced these really 
sort of bizarre and grotesque deaths 

2376
02:21:12,440 --> 02:21:13,273
that those animals would not take a 
strict nine bait after they saw that 

2377
02:21:18,711 --> 02:21:23,711
happen to one of their pack members.
And so in the 19 forties,

2378
02:21:24,921 --> 02:21:29,450
we came up with three new poisons.
Uh,

2379
02:21:29,480 --> 02:21:34,180
one of them was call a sodium.
Uh,

2380
02:21:34,290 --> 02:21:36,860
let's see,
sodium,

2381
02:21:36,950 --> 02:21:40,850
a floor Acetate,
which is the one we now call 10 80,

2382
02:21:41,420 --> 02:21:45,680
and it was called 10 80 and it was used 
for the next 19 that was in fact,

2383
02:21:45,681 --> 02:21:47,900
it's still used in limited application 
today,

2384
02:21:48,470 --> 02:21:53,470
but it was a poison that was developed 
after 1080 tries by this laboratory that

2385
02:21:55,620 --> 02:21:56,453
assists 19 20th specialized in 
developing poisons to kill a wolves and 

2386
02:22:00,501 --> 02:22:01,334
coyotes.
It's called the eradication methods 

2387
02:22:04,191 --> 02:22:06,860
laboratory.
So 10 80,

2388
02:22:07,160 --> 02:22:08,330
uh,
another one,

2389
02:22:08,480 --> 02:22:09,313
sodium foul medium was a poison that 
kill coyotes so slowly that they would 

2390
02:22:18,021 --> 02:22:22,940
often survive for a week after they ate 
the poison.

2391
02:22:24,200 --> 02:22:28,320
And in that week their pads would fall 
off,

2392
02:22:29,040 --> 02:22:34,040
their hair would fall off,
the village would come off their bodies.

2393
02:22:34,830 --> 02:22:35,663
Uh,
there's one story where a farmer in 

2394
02:22:38,970 --> 02:22:43,970
Colorado found during the winter of 
about 18 or 19,

2395
02:22:44,071 --> 02:22:44,904
47 or 48,
he found seven or eight coyotes in his 

2396
02:22:48,451 --> 02:22:52,830
barn with no pads on their feet,
no hair on their bodies,

2397
02:22:53,040 --> 02:22:55,830
all huddled together trying to stay 
warm.

2398
02:22:55,831 --> 02:22:58,020
She's,
and he killed them with a pitch fork.

2399
02:22:58,110 --> 02:22:58,943
Oh my God.
But the reason we introduced these 

2400
02:23:02,341 --> 02:23:05,040
poisons,
and there was a third one too,

2401
02:23:05,430 --> 02:23:07,890
which was a cyanide,
uh,

2402
02:23:08,460 --> 02:23:12,910
basically the one that we call him 44 
now that are little cartridges that fire

2403
02:23:12,911 --> 02:23:17,911
assign I'd missed into their mouths is 
because these poisons killed them slowly

2404
02:23:18,811 --> 02:23:23,811
enough that other coyote is witnessing 
the victim taking the bite of the poison

2405
02:23:27,211 --> 02:23:30,090
bait.
Didn't put two and two together.

2406
02:23:30,270 --> 02:23:31,710
Wow.
Yeah.

2407
02:23:31,770 --> 02:23:32,670
I mean,
so we ha.

2408
02:23:32,730 --> 02:23:37,730
We even had these kinds of insights 
about how animals will observe something

2409
02:23:38,190 --> 02:23:39,023
and preserve a memory of what they've 
seen and then try to actually come up 

2410
02:23:43,980 --> 02:23:47,040
with,
with a poison that plays against that.

2411
02:23:48,060 --> 02:23:49,290
Absolutely fascinating.

2412
02:23:50,300 --> 02:23:51,360
The whole,
the whole subject.

2413
02:23:51,361 --> 02:23:52,830
Absolutely fascinating.
Listen man,

2414
02:23:52,831 --> 02:23:53,664
I'm so glad we got together.
I want to get you together with Randall 

2415
02:23:56,410 --> 02:23:57,243
Carlson though.
Would you be interested in coming back 

2416
02:23:57,871 --> 02:23:59,580
and doing another shot?
I'd love to do that.

2417
02:23:59,610 --> 02:24:00,443
I would great to have you get together 
with him and compare notes because he 

2418
02:24:02,611 --> 02:24:03,444
has some really interesting observations
about these asteroidal impacts and I 

2419
02:24:06,811 --> 02:24:09,960
think the two of you together would have
a fascinating conversation.

2420
02:24:09,961 --> 02:24:12,870
So let's do that down the line.
But until then,

2421
02:24:12,900 --> 02:24:15,480
your book,
Coyote America is fantastic.

2422
02:24:15,481 --> 02:24:17,910
I loved it.
Thank you very much for that.

2423
02:24:17,940 --> 02:24:20,190
And I'm going to.
I haven't started reading yet,

2424
02:24:20,191 --> 02:24:21,870
but American Serengeti is your other 
book.

2425
02:24:21,871 --> 02:24:24,270
I'm sure it's equally awesome and I 
really enjoyed this.

2426
02:24:24,271 --> 02:24:25,770
Thank you so much.
Really appreciate it.

2427
02:24:26,000 --> 02:24:26,791
Thanks for having me,
man.

2428
02:24:26,791 --> 02:24:28,060
It's been great.
All right folks.

2429
02:24:28,110 --> 02:24:29,070
See you next week.
Bye.
