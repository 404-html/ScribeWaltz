1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:01,620
The joe rogan experience.

2
00:00:02,010 --> 00:00:02,311
Okay,

3
00:00:02,311 --> 00:00:03,480
let's not get crazy time.

4
00:00:03,660 --> 00:00:06,090
I've never been a big comedy short guy.

5
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:06,580
Uh,

6
00:00:06,580 --> 00:00:07,770
I just recently,

7
00:00:08,450 --> 00:00:09,151
like this year,

8
00:00:09,151 --> 00:00:10,710
I've done like three sets there.

9
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:11,190
And,

10
00:00:11,190 --> 00:00:11,510
uh,

11
00:00:11,510 --> 00:00:11,850
that,

12
00:00:11,850 --> 00:00:12,683
that's,

13
00:00:12,870 --> 00:00:13,640
uh,

14
00:00:13,640 --> 00:00:14,473
well,

15
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:15,730
I,

16
00:00:15,730 --> 00:00:17,220
I've enjoyed going there and hanging out.

17
00:00:17,221 --> 00:00:20,640
Like I think the last time
I saw you was there a,

18
00:00:20,641 --> 00:00:23,010
when I rented you a few
years ago and you know,

19
00:00:23,050 --> 00:00:25,170
a good friends of mine play there.

20
00:00:25,350 --> 00:00:26,183
Um,

21
00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:29,400
but I always had a strange feeling about
the place in which I'm starting to get

22
00:00:29,401 --> 00:00:30,330
over now,

23
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:31,410
uh,

24
00:00:31,410 --> 00:00:31,951
because I've,

25
00:00:31,951 --> 00:00:33,780
I've enjoyed playing there this year.

26
00:00:34,050 --> 00:00:34,470
But,

27
00:00:34,470 --> 00:00:35,303
uh,

28
00:00:35,490 --> 00:00:36,230
I'm from,

29
00:00:36,230 --> 00:00:36,390
uh,

30
00:00:36,390 --> 00:00:40,110
the Orlando Florida area
and when I was 19 years old,

31
00:00:40,170 --> 00:00:41,730
I won this contest,

32
00:00:42,060 --> 00:00:44,970
the funniest person in
central Florida contest.

33
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:46,920
Not Funny Person in Florida,

34
00:00:46,930 --> 00:00:48,420
funny person in central Florida,

35
00:00:48,630 --> 00:00:49,680
which I think is hilarious.

36
00:00:50,010 --> 00:00:50,520
Um,

37
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:52,710
there was a kid in south
Florida who was a real bad ass.

38
00:00:53,130 --> 00:00:53,963
Um,

39
00:00:54,060 --> 00:00:58,980
and the Grand Prize of this contest was
I got to go to fly to Los Angeles and do

40
00:00:58,981 --> 00:01:00,180
a set at the comedy store.

41
00:01:00,570 --> 00:01:01,770
And I'm 19 years old,

42
00:01:01,771 --> 00:01:02,011
man.

43
00:01:02,011 --> 00:01:03,390
I've been no comedy for two years.

44
00:01:03,690 --> 00:01:04,021
La.

45
00:01:04,021 --> 00:01:05,400
The college or Oh my God,

46
00:01:05,401 --> 00:01:06,870
you'd have thought I
was doing Johnny Carson.

47
00:01:06,871 --> 00:01:07,651
This is my break,

48
00:01:07,651 --> 00:01:08,430
baby.

49
00:01:08,430 --> 00:01:09,750
Cool la man.

50
00:01:10,050 --> 00:01:11,160
And in retrospect,

51
00:01:11,161 --> 00:01:14,820
it was an open mic night
and I only did five minutes,

52
00:01:14,821 --> 00:01:17,610
but there was a very
famous comedian there.

53
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:18,650
Uh,

54
00:01:18,650 --> 00:01:20,100
I won't mention the man's name.

55
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:20,731
Uh,

56
00:01:20,731 --> 00:01:23,490
and he acted like I was the funniest
comedian and ever seen in his life.

57
00:01:24,150 --> 00:01:25,050
And then he invites,

58
00:01:25,051 --> 00:01:25,830
he a big guy.

59
00:01:25,830 --> 00:01:27,870
I'm not saying it was a Pauly shore.

60
00:01:28,590 --> 00:01:29,423
No,

61
00:01:29,790 --> 00:01:30,150
no.

62
00:01:30,150 --> 00:01:32,610
Let's just for the record
state who was not Pauly shore?

63
00:01:33,670 --> 00:01:34,430
Uh,

64
00:01:34,430 --> 00:01:34,661
no,

65
00:01:34,661 --> 00:01:35,040
let's go.

66
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:35,310
Let's,

67
00:01:35,310 --> 00:01:35,791
let's,

68
00:01:35,791 --> 00:01:36,624
uh,

69
00:01:36,990 --> 00:01:37,823
leave some mystery.

70
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:39,113
Um,

71
00:01:40,650 --> 00:01:41,390
anyway,

72
00:01:41,390 --> 00:01:42,190
so,

73
00:01:42,190 --> 00:01:43,500
so Amy not be a big guy.

74
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:47,730
He invites me to hang out with him and
then he asked me to take a drive with him

75
00:01:47,731 --> 00:01:48,301
and Oh my God,

76
00:01:48,301 --> 00:01:48,631
you know,

77
00:01:48,631 --> 00:01:51,540
wouldn't want to take a
drive with famous guy.

78
00:01:51,810 --> 00:01:52,490
And,

79
00:01:52,490 --> 00:01:52,620
uh,

80
00:01:52,620 --> 00:01:53,370
we'd car car.

81
00:01:53,370 --> 00:01:55,470
We parked in front of,

82
00:01:55,770 --> 00:01:56,260
uh,

83
00:01:56,260 --> 00:01:59,160
the rage on Santa Monica
for like 20 minutes,

84
00:01:59,810 --> 00:02:01,200
and he said he's gay bar.

85
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:01,801
Well,

86
00:02:01,801 --> 00:02:03,360
years later when I lived in La,

87
00:02:03,361 --> 00:02:05,900
I find out the rage is like the
biggest gay bar in Los Angeles.

88
00:02:05,910 --> 00:02:07,140
I had no idea at the time.

89
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:11,910
So this guy is showing
off his young meat and uh,

90
00:02:11,911 --> 00:02:15,450
and then he says he needs to go
by his apartment in Beverly Hills.

91
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:17,220
And uh,

92
00:02:17,250 --> 00:02:18,260
we go in and the,

93
00:02:18,270 --> 00:02:19,021
on his wall,

94
00:02:19,021 --> 00:02:22,320
he had all these photos of him and
famous people that were signed in.

95
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:26,850
And so we go from one side down
all the way and he's showing me,

96
00:02:26,970 --> 00:02:27,803
you know,

97
00:02:28,250 --> 00:02:31,800
this is me with Gandhi and
Martin Luther King and whatever,

98
00:02:31,801 --> 00:02:32,634
whoever,

99
00:02:33,290 --> 00:02:34,070
and a,

100
00:02:34,070 --> 00:02:37,080
and then we get to the end of
the wall and it's the corner.

101
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:41,220
This was the guys move
to show you the pictures.

102
00:02:41,221 --> 00:02:42,930
You start at one side and then boom,

103
00:02:42,931 --> 00:02:43,860
you're in the corner.

104
00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:45,960
And He makes this move on me.

105
00:02:47,190 --> 00:02:52,190
And I'm 19 years old and
the guy steps in on me

106
00:02:55,740 --> 00:02:56,700
and I just like,

107
00:02:56,701 --> 00:03:01,540
I just like Kinda of I the n
and the guy steps in on me.

108
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:02,320
Any,

109
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:04,210
he cupped my ass.

110
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:04,991
Oh,

111
00:03:04,991 --> 00:03:06,900
with each hand he's got it.

112
00:03:07,090 --> 00:03:07,820
And it has to,

113
00:03:07,820 --> 00:03:09,130
why you're afraid to say this man's name?

114
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:09,791
I don't say it.

115
00:03:09,791 --> 00:03:10,031
Don't,

116
00:03:10,031 --> 00:03:10,241
don't,

117
00:03:10,241 --> 00:03:11,140
I won't say I won't.

118
00:03:11,141 --> 00:03:11,561
I promise you,

119
00:03:11,561 --> 00:03:12,310
I won't say it,

120
00:03:12,310 --> 00:03:13,510
but I will say what it rhymes with.

121
00:03:13,540 --> 00:03:13,731
No,

122
00:03:13,731 --> 00:03:14,051
no,

123
00:03:14,051 --> 00:03:14,220
no,

124
00:03:14,220 --> 00:03:14,360
no,

125
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:14,630
no,

126
00:03:14,630 --> 00:03:14,771
no.

127
00:03:14,771 --> 00:03:15,041
Don't,

128
00:03:15,041 --> 00:03:15,311
don't,

129
00:03:15,311 --> 00:03:15,551
don't,

130
00:03:15,551 --> 00:03:15,761
don't,

131
00:03:15,761 --> 00:03:16,540
don't do it.

132
00:03:16,540 --> 00:03:17,050
Please don't.

133
00:03:17,050 --> 00:03:17,200
Well,

134
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:18,070
I'm so anyway,

135
00:03:18,130 --> 00:03:18,641
uh,

136
00:03:18,641 --> 00:03:19,474
you know,

137
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:20,141
I said,

138
00:03:20,141 --> 00:03:23,260
can we go back to the comedy store and,

139
00:03:23,261 --> 00:03:24,094
um,

140
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:28,060
I can't help but reflect on that moment
all these years later and think how much

141
00:03:28,061 --> 00:03:30,230
further my career would have gone
if I would've just fucked it up.

142
00:03:30,730 --> 00:03:31,563
I don't think so.

143
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:33,570
You would lose all your street credit,

144
00:03:33,590 --> 00:03:34,990
kidding Louis.

145
00:03:35,770 --> 00:03:36,041
Anyway,

146
00:03:36,041 --> 00:03:36,874
but that was why.

147
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:37,511
So like,

148
00:03:37,511 --> 00:03:37,691
you know,

149
00:03:37,691 --> 00:03:38,710
and I go back to Florida,

150
00:03:38,740 --> 00:03:39,460
I'm 19 and like,

151
00:03:39,460 --> 00:03:39,761
people are like,

152
00:03:39,761 --> 00:03:39,911
hey,

153
00:03:39,911 --> 00:03:40,960
how was your trip to Hollywood?

154
00:03:40,990 --> 00:03:41,950
I don't want to talk about it.

155
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:43,440
And,

156
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:44,020
uh,

157
00:03:44,020 --> 00:03:46,780
have you talked to him since [inaudible]
seven and never seen the guy ever

158
00:03:46,781 --> 00:03:47,051
again.

159
00:03:47,051 --> 00:03:47,410
But,

160
00:03:47,410 --> 00:03:48,243
um,

161
00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:48,520
uh,

162
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:48,881
but yeah,

163
00:03:48,881 --> 00:03:51,840
so that kind of made me
chai away from the comedies.

164
00:03:51,930 --> 00:03:52,763
Sure.

165
00:04:20,630 --> 00:04:20,921
You ready to,

166
00:04:20,921 --> 00:04:22,640
of course recording.

167
00:04:22,850 --> 00:04:22,971
Oh,

168
00:04:22,971 --> 00:04:23,804
it is already.

169
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:24,860
What the fuck's on?
