1
00:00:01,050 --> 00:00:02,920
Hello Freak bitches.

2
00:00:03,220 --> 00:00:04,290
How'd you get so well,

3
00:00:04,300 --> 00:00:08,640
how did you get the Alex Jones wanted to
be nine 11 nine one one I had a plan it

4
00:00:08,641 --> 00:00:09,350
out so I had to,

5
00:00:09,350 --> 00:00:10,171
we had to do,

6
00:00:10,171 --> 00:00:12,180
I had a fit some podcasts in,

7
00:00:12,181 --> 00:00:15,930
I had to do like extra ones the week
before just so I could get to number nine

8
00:00:15,931 --> 00:00:16,890
11 with Alex,

9
00:00:17,060 --> 00:00:17,270
right,

10
00:00:17,270 --> 00:00:17,670
wasn't it?

11
00:00:17,670 --> 00:00:18,990
That sounds like a long,

12
00:00:19,350 --> 00:00:23,640
see pat him on earlier and I would have
definitely had them on again for nine 11

13
00:00:23,641 --> 00:00:26,580
but having one the first time
for nine 11 and to this day,

14
00:00:26,581 --> 00:00:31,581
that's our biggest podcasts by
really by maybe 5 million downloads.

15
00:00:33,031 --> 00:00:33,870
Fuck yeah,

16
00:00:33,871 --> 00:00:35,010
but here's the conspiracy,

17
00:00:35,011 --> 00:00:35,191
right?

18
00:00:35,191 --> 00:00:35,701
Is that right?

19
00:00:35,701 --> 00:00:36,600
Am I saying correctly?

20
00:00:36,630 --> 00:00:37,620
What is the actual number?

21
00:00:39,460 --> 00:00:40,620
Probably 16 now.

22
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:42,060
I didn't check in the
last two or three days,

23
00:00:42,061 --> 00:00:42,781
but okay,

24
00:00:42,781 --> 00:00:44,400
so it's 16 million dot.

25
00:00:44,430 --> 00:00:45,263
Here's what's crazy.

26
00:00:45,870 --> 00:00:48,090
It never charted on iTunes.

27
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:53,130
The iTunes charts magically went down
while the Alex Jones podcast was in the

28
00:00:53,131 --> 00:00:54,990
queue and they stayed
down for over a week.

29
00:00:54,991 --> 00:00:59,991
Conspiracy theory and then when it
came back up podcasts that got way less

30
00:01:00,061 --> 00:01:01,530
downloads than Alex's.

31
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:06,560
We're re we're rated much higher than
his and they had happened before and

32
00:01:06,601 --> 00:01:07,140
afterwards.

33
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:11,730
I do remember kids was the only podcast
that was left out of the ratings loop,

34
00:01:11,940 --> 00:01:14,520
like for sure it would have been the
number one podcast in the country.

35
00:01:14,550 --> 00:01:17,520
It was the number one podcast we did
by a mile and I've had the number one

36
00:01:17,521 --> 00:01:18,480
podcast before.

37
00:01:18,830 --> 00:01:23,520
It's like the number one podcast episode
that was more than 5 million downloads

38
00:01:23,521 --> 00:01:25,170
more than any other podcasts I had before.

39
00:01:25,540 --> 00:01:28,590
So it's should for sure probably would
have been number one if it wasn't a lot

40
00:01:28,591 --> 00:01:31,500
of downloads unless they had like one of
those serial episodes or something that

41
00:01:31,501 --> 00:01:32,334
came out that week.

42
00:01:33,990 --> 00:01:34,823
So there you go.

43
00:01:34,890 --> 00:01:36,030
And that's,

44
00:01:36,310 --> 00:01:39,710
it's very likely that someone's trying
to hold Alex Jones back and that's just

45
00:01:39,711 --> 00:01:41,340
stokes his fucking fight.

46
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:42,240
They don't understand this.

47
00:01:42,241 --> 00:01:46,620
The Streisand effect can
stoke the fire of Alex Jones.

48
00:01:46,621 --> 00:01:49,440
Even Megan Kelly's fuck now her
show's going down the toilet.

49
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:51,180
It can happen in the aftermath.

50
00:01:51,540 --> 00:01:52,140
She,

51
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:52,621
here's the,

52
00:01:52,621 --> 00:01:54,200
here's the problem is a problem.

53
00:01:54,270 --> 00:01:57,060
Megan Kelly was a Fox News person.

54
00:01:57,270 --> 00:01:59,400
She left Fox News to go to NBC.

55
00:01:59,430 --> 00:02:02,520
NBC is thought of as CNBC,

56
00:02:02,521 --> 00:02:06,750
which is thought of as fake
news by these right wing Trump.

57
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:08,070
Trump bands,

58
00:02:08,130 --> 00:02:08,910
what would you call him?

59
00:02:08,910 --> 00:02:10,500
Trump Trumpers.

60
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:12,540
So as soon as she goes over there,

61
00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:13,650
they're not going to listen to her.

62
00:02:13,950 --> 00:02:15,300
And then to the liberals,

63
00:02:15,450 --> 00:02:16,530
she's Fox News,

64
00:02:16,580 --> 00:02:16,830
right?

65
00:02:16,830 --> 00:02:18,360
So they're not interested in either.

66
00:02:18,570 --> 00:02:21,600
And then she does this podcast with
Alex Jones or this interview rather with

67
00:02:21,601 --> 00:02:23,520
Alex Jones and the
interview with Alex Jones.

68
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:24,660
She says,

69
00:02:25,110 --> 00:02:27,600
I'm not going to paint
you out as a monster.

70
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:28,431
I'm going to give you a fair,

71
00:02:28,431 --> 00:02:29,550
like she's saying all these things,

72
00:02:29,551 --> 00:02:30,990
like she's going to
throw softballs as way.

73
00:02:30,991 --> 00:02:32,550
I want people to get to know you.

74
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:34,620
And he releases all that and he's like,

75
00:02:34,621 --> 00:02:34,771
Hey,

76
00:02:34,771 --> 00:02:35,581
this is that person.

77
00:02:35,581 --> 00:02:37,440
And then the ratings just keep cutting,

78
00:02:37,950 --> 00:02:38,251
right?

79
00:02:38,251 --> 00:02:38,490
Like,

80
00:02:38,490 --> 00:02:41,710
but famous but not like
Tom Cruise fairness.

81
00:02:41,730 --> 00:02:42,360
Right.

82
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:42,901
Tom Cruise,

83
00:02:42,901 --> 00:02:44,310
like connected with that person.

84
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:44,840
I can't,

85
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:46,660
it would make it a better story
if I hadn't remembered who it was.

86
00:02:46,661 --> 00:02:47,670
But it was somebody like that,

87
00:02:47,671 --> 00:02:49,530
like your level or like or,

88
00:02:49,740 --> 00:02:51,900
or like a mark Duplass or
you know what I'm saying?

89
00:02:51,901 --> 00:02:53,850
Like I don't know who mark the plaza's.

90
00:02:54,210 --> 00:02:55,260
Well he's the guy at your level.

91
00:02:55,380 --> 00:02:56,213
No,

92
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:57,000
no,

93
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:57,211
he's,

94
00:02:57,211 --> 00:02:59,120
I know he is the duplos.

95
00:02:59,210 --> 00:03:00,130
She knows who everybody is.

96
00:03:00,131 --> 00:03:01,560
I don't know who the deposit there,

97
00:03:01,870 --> 00:03:02,703
ed there,

98
00:03:02,730 --> 00:03:05,020
they're made the show togetherness on Hbo.

99
00:03:05,021 --> 00:03:07,180
My point isn't about the
Duplass brothers is like,

100
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:08,710
they were just like semi famous,

101
00:03:08,711 --> 00:03:09,544
not like

102
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:12,020
Tom Cruise cruise.

103
00:03:12,140 --> 00:03:12,411
Got It.

104
00:03:12,411 --> 00:03:13,244
So yeah,

105
00:03:13,290 --> 00:03:14,140
so horny,

106
00:03:14,141 --> 00:03:15,360
she wants to get to the fight.

107
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:20,500
So you see he got invited to a
Superbowl party at this person's house.

108
00:03:20,501 --> 00:03:20,930
Right.

109
00:03:20,930 --> 00:03:23,740
I could imagine if Tom Cruise is coming
to your house for the Super Super Bowl

110
00:03:23,770 --> 00:03:24,431
super bowl party,

111
00:03:24,431 --> 00:03:24,790
he was like,

112
00:03:24,790 --> 00:03:26,560
oh whoa asking Tom Cruise.

113
00:03:26,561 --> 00:03:27,400
And he says yes.

114
00:03:27,820 --> 00:03:28,651
I like honey,

115
00:03:28,651 --> 00:03:29,351
you said yes.

116
00:03:29,351 --> 00:03:30,184
What do we do?

117
00:03:30,430 --> 00:03:30,671
Right?

118
00:03:30,671 --> 00:03:31,840
And the Mediterranean Tom Cruise be like,

119
00:03:31,841 --> 00:03:33,730
I think I will be among the humans today.

120
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:35,291
So Tom Cruise,

121
00:03:35,291 --> 00:03:37,180
it barely shows up with a brand new,

122
00:03:37,181 --> 00:03:39,580
like clearly fresh football,

123
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:41,080
but his assistant like you know,

124
00:03:41,081 --> 00:03:44,590
he's like tossing like a literal
brand new football in the air.

125
00:03:44,591 --> 00:03:45,070
Right.

126
00:03:45,070 --> 00:03:47,530
And they're all talking about marriage
at some point in the day and goes,

127
00:03:47,531 --> 00:03:49,570
do you know what the best part
of being married is though?

128
00:03:49,571 --> 00:03:50,130
Right.

129
00:03:50,130 --> 00:03:51,550
It's fucking your wife,

130
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:52,473
am I right?

131
00:03:52,870 --> 00:03:57,870
You just fuck your wife and everybody's
like felt like tumbleweeds are all the

132
00:03:58,121 --> 00:03:59,470
parts sort of like a robot,

133
00:03:59,770 --> 00:04:01,080
like an alien visiting us.

134
00:04:01,081 --> 00:04:01,450
Yeah.

135
00:04:01,450 --> 00:04:03,070
He must be amazing to hang out with.

136
00:04:03,071 --> 00:04:04,420
I would love to hang out with him.

137
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:05,740
Fucking your wife.

138
00:04:05,741 --> 00:04:06,574
Right?

139
00:04:08,030 --> 00:04:09,140
I mean when you're that famous,

140
00:04:09,141 --> 00:04:10,190
your work ethic,

141
00:04:10,191 --> 00:04:14,360
it's like you just devote everything
to that I think because like I have my,

142
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:15,380
my agents were like,

143
00:04:15,381 --> 00:04:17,700
they know that the agents
who are Tom Cruise,

144
00:04:17,701 --> 00:04:18,051
they didn't,

145
00:04:18,051 --> 00:04:21,170
they said Tom Cruise always gets back
within an hour when we send a script,

146
00:04:21,590 --> 00:04:24,560
cause I like keep a script for like three
weeks and then by the time I read it,

147
00:04:24,561 --> 00:04:25,670
the parts being gassed.

148
00:04:26,810 --> 00:04:28,160
Is it Tom Cruise?

149
00:04:28,161 --> 00:04:31,400
We'll read a script and an hour and get
back to them and either like it or not

150
00:04:31,401 --> 00:04:31,970
like it.

151
00:04:31,970 --> 00:04:34,100
Like he's just like on the ball.

152
00:04:34,101 --> 00:04:34,311
He's,

153
00:04:34,311 --> 00:04:34,520
yeah,

154
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:35,420
he's like,

155
00:04:35,450 --> 00:04:36,440
he's trying to win.

156
00:04:37,190 --> 00:04:41,630
He's won and it's an inhuman instinct
because our human instinct is to just

157
00:04:41,631 --> 00:04:44,570
atrophy in a way.

158
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:46,010
I mean you have to kind of fight it,

159
00:04:46,100 --> 00:04:47,690
but easy to be lazy.

160
00:04:47,691 --> 00:04:48,620
I'm to procrastinate.

161
00:04:48,690 --> 00:04:49,980
It's definitely easy to be lazy,

162
00:04:49,981 --> 00:04:50,641
but it's not.

163
00:04:50,641 --> 00:04:53,160
If you're going to be Tom cruise
really have to be on the ball.

164
00:04:53,190 --> 00:04:54,030
There's no other way.

165
00:04:54,090 --> 00:04:55,780
It doesn't just time job.

166
00:04:55,840 --> 00:05:00,720
That's not just what's going on and was
just some weird alien sort of behavior

167
00:05:00,721 --> 00:05:02,880
patterns that we don't
recognize as being normal.

168
00:05:02,881 --> 00:05:04,350
Like when he jumped up on Oprah's couch,

169
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:05,611
it's like I'm in love,

170
00:05:05,611 --> 00:05:06,091
I'm in love,

171
00:05:06,091 --> 00:05:06,541
I'm in love,

172
00:05:06,541 --> 00:05:07,200
and it was like,

173
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:08,730
what the fuck is going on here?

174
00:05:08,910 --> 00:05:09,090
I,

175
00:05:09,090 --> 00:05:10,050
it's like it's a person.

176
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:10,231
No,

177
00:05:10,231 --> 00:05:12,540
it's like a person who
doesn't understand French,

178
00:05:12,810 --> 00:05:15,890
but you're speaking French to a French
person who saying all the right words,

179
00:05:16,590 --> 00:05:17,700
like what the fuck is wrong?

180
00:05:18,330 --> 00:05:22,830
It seems like every choice he makes
outside of acting is based on what he's

181
00:05:22,831 --> 00:05:25,860
assuming normal human beings
think is the normal behavior.

182
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:26,170
Right?

183
00:05:26,170 --> 00:05:26,490
So it goes,

184
00:05:26,490 --> 00:05:26,701
Ooh,

185
00:05:26,701 --> 00:05:28,320
love is when you jump on a couch or go,

186
00:05:28,321 --> 00:05:29,190
I love her,

187
00:05:29,191 --> 00:05:31,680
which is informed by movies really.

188
00:05:31,681 --> 00:05:32,011
Right?

189
00:05:32,011 --> 00:05:33,570
Like that's more movie like,

190
00:05:33,571 --> 00:05:33,781
right.

191
00:05:33,781 --> 00:05:35,910
That's like John Cusak
and say anything like,

192
00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:36,151
oh,

193
00:05:36,151 --> 00:05:37,140
that's what love looks like.

194
00:05:37,141 --> 00:05:37,974
It's not,

195
00:05:38,030 --> 00:05:38,470
you know,

196
00:05:38,470 --> 00:05:42,660
or telling a bunch of the fellows in
Oregon to have sex talk with the fellows.

197
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:43,050
Oh,

198
00:05:43,050 --> 00:05:44,420
it's a wild look to fuck my wife.

199
00:05:44,421 --> 00:05:44,850
Huh?

200
00:05:44,850 --> 00:05:47,820
The friction of her vagina makes
me just sploosh how right guys?

201
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:48,793
And everyone's like

202
00:05:49,430 --> 00:05:49,980
everyone like,

203
00:05:49,980 --> 00:05:50,221
oh,

204
00:05:50,221 --> 00:05:51,054
we're sick of fucking,

205
00:05:52,090 --> 00:05:53,450
do you remember when
people were wearing those,

206
00:05:53,451 --> 00:05:56,750
a holograms attached to a
rubber band around their wrist?

207
00:05:57,110 --> 00:05:57,441
And,

208
00:05:57,441 --> 00:05:57,680
uh,

209
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:59,120
do you remember these
stupid fucking things?

210
00:05:59,570 --> 00:06:00,051
Do you remember him?

211
00:06:00,051 --> 00:06:00,620
Jamie?

212
00:06:00,620 --> 00:06:01,050
You remember?

213
00:06:01,050 --> 00:06:01,760
Right?

214
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:04,580
I think Gwyneth Paltrow has got in
trouble for selling them on her.

215
00:06:04,581 --> 00:06:04,721
Like,

216
00:06:04,721 --> 00:06:05,300
well,

217
00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:06,880
damn fucking bitch.

218
00:06:06,881 --> 00:06:07,490
Same thing.

219
00:06:07,490 --> 00:06:08,323
No offense.

220
00:06:08,350 --> 00:06:10,250
But I might've,

221
00:06:10,251 --> 00:06:11,720
I might've said some mean things about,

222
00:06:11,860 --> 00:06:16,100
it's been a couple of things about her
lately and her fucking nutty website.

223
00:06:16,430 --> 00:06:17,200
She takes,

224
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:17,360
she,

225
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:19,670
you're supposed to wear like
a rock inside your vagina.

226
00:06:20,030 --> 00:06:20,960
Isn't that one of those things?

227
00:06:21,140 --> 00:06:22,280
I call them pussy rocks.

228
00:06:22,281 --> 00:06:22,500
Yeah.

229
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:23,870
Pussy rocks are hilarious.

230
00:06:24,330 --> 00:06:25,880
I guess it would be like strengthen you

231
00:06:27,530 --> 00:06:28,790
if you want to strengthen it.

232
00:06:28,791 --> 00:06:30,230
Just two key goals around a dick.

233
00:06:30,260 --> 00:06:31,070
That's my,

234
00:06:31,070 --> 00:06:32,120
that's my method.

235
00:06:32,870 --> 00:06:33,290
Works out.

236
00:06:33,290 --> 00:06:35,370
Maybe if it can't be a dick or a rocks.

237
00:06:35,570 --> 00:06:36,403
Good way to go.

238
00:06:36,410 --> 00:06:38,900
Gwyneth Paltrow wants to
heal you with magic stickers.

239
00:06:38,901 --> 00:06:39,734
Jesus Christ.

240
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:42,210
She needs getting paid though.

241
00:06:42,211 --> 00:06:42,831
I'll tell you that.

242
00:06:42,831 --> 00:06:45,890
There's a lot of dummies out there that
are sought momming all the way to the

243
00:06:46,250 --> 00:06:47,090
ATM machine.

244
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:50,000
She is proof that bullshit
sells way better than science.

245
00:06:50,010 --> 00:06:50,390
I'm,

246
00:06:50,390 --> 00:06:51,560
I do not have her,

247
00:06:51,561 --> 00:06:52,394
her salary.

248
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:52,920
Oh wait a minute.

249
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:54,890
You can rebalance the energy frequency.

250
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:55,753
I didn't know that.

251
00:06:55,790 --> 00:06:56,720
Hold on a second.

252
00:06:57,170 --> 00:06:59,450
She's discovered something about stickers.

253
00:06:59,730 --> 00:06:59,890
Do.

254
00:06:59,890 --> 00:07:01,190
If you take these stickers,

255
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:03,080
if they're made with the right material,

256
00:07:03,081 --> 00:07:05,330
you just stick them on your
body in the right places.

257
00:07:05,331 --> 00:07:10,331
And they in quotes rebalance the energy
frequency in our bodies are made out of

258
00:07:10,791 --> 00:07:12,890
a NASA space suit material.

259
00:07:13,550 --> 00:07:16,490
And NASA said it was a load of bs,

260
00:07:16,610 --> 00:07:17,750
but hold on a second.

261
00:07:17,810 --> 00:07:19,640
I don't think that NASA is right.

262
00:07:21,110 --> 00:07:21,943
Bunch of movies.

263
00:07:22,250 --> 00:07:23,160
Hold on cause he'll just stop.

264
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:23,331
Stop.

265
00:07:23,331 --> 00:07:23,550
Stop.

266
00:07:23,550 --> 00:07:27,830
School science says Gwyneth
Paltrow's goop website,

267
00:07:27,860 --> 00:07:32,060
a lifestyle business lifestyle which
sells all things with advertise.

268
00:07:32,061 --> 00:07:35,570
These stickers are using
NASA space suit material,

269
00:07:35,571 --> 00:07:38,750
which presumably was the source
of their magic healing properties.

270
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:40,670
Jesus fucking Christ.

271
00:07:40,700 --> 00:07:43,970
She's special stickers and not made.

272
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:45,380
This is what NASA says.

273
00:07:45,381 --> 00:07:47,840
They're not made of space suit material,

274
00:07:47,990 --> 00:07:48,571
not that space.

275
00:07:48,571 --> 00:07:49,490
New suit material.

276
00:07:49,491 --> 00:07:50,360
It has healing properties.

277
00:07:50,370 --> 00:07:51,410
The first place it doesn't,

278
00:07:51,770 --> 00:07:53,660
but the quote from the
foreign NASA scientist,

279
00:07:53,661 --> 00:07:58,661
Mark Shel Shel Ham Shell Shell
Hummer Shelmar Shelmar sums it up.

280
00:07:58,810 --> 00:07:59,300
Uh,

281
00:07:59,300 --> 00:07:59,661
he goes,

282
00:07:59,661 --> 00:08:00,290
wow,

283
00:08:00,290 --> 00:08:02,350
what a load of bs this is or that.

284
00:08:02,450 --> 00:08:02,870
Yeah,

285
00:08:02,870 --> 00:08:03,340
okay.

286
00:08:03,340 --> 00:08:05,150
She's obviously goop,

287
00:08:05,151 --> 00:08:06,320
quickly updated its site.

288
00:08:06,350 --> 00:08:06,561
Now,

289
00:08:06,561 --> 00:08:09,620
it doesn't claim anything about
NASA space suits and stickers,

290
00:08:10,010 --> 00:08:12,500
but it didn't dial back end
in the magical healing claims.

291
00:08:12,530 --> 00:08:16,400
Here's what coops has now in an article
called wearable stickers that promote

292
00:08:16,401 --> 00:08:18,350
healing in parentheses.

293
00:08:18,470 --> 00:08:19,303
Really,

294
00:08:19,550 --> 00:08:24,550
you fuck human bodies operate
at an ideal energetic frequency,

295
00:08:26,061 --> 00:08:28,160
but everyday stresses and anxiety.

296
00:08:28,370 --> 00:08:29,240
You're giving me stress.

297
00:08:29,241 --> 00:08:29,900
You Bitch,

298
00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:31,970
you can throw off our internal balance,

299
00:08:32,210 --> 00:08:35,420
depleting our energy reserves
and weakening our immune system.

300
00:08:35,421 --> 00:08:38,590
I'm fucking imagine thinking that you
could put a sticker on you and it's going

301
00:08:38,591 --> 00:08:39,320
to heal you.

302
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:40,490
Body vibe stickers.

303
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:40,881
Oh my God.

304
00:08:40,881 --> 00:08:42,920
They're called body
vibes coming pre pre-pro.

305
00:08:42,950 --> 00:08:44,300
They come preprogrammed.

306
00:08:44,420 --> 00:08:45,830
Oh fuck the programming.

307
00:08:46,190 --> 00:08:48,890
I didn't know that to an ideal frequency,

308
00:08:48,891 --> 00:08:51,110
allowing them to target imbalances.

309
00:08:51,290 --> 00:08:52,880
You motherfucker,

310
00:08:53,390 --> 00:08:54,650
you fucking crook.

311
00:08:54,990 --> 00:08:55,860
Don't you have enough money,

312
00:08:55,861 --> 00:08:57,710
bitch it Jesus Christ.

313
00:08:57,750 --> 00:08:58,111
Currently,

314
00:08:58,111 --> 00:09:01,500
the residuals on the iron man
movies just weren't enough for her.

315
00:09:02,430 --> 00:09:03,211
God Damn.

316
00:09:03,211 --> 00:09:05,040
60 bucks for a 10 pound.

317
00:09:05,090 --> 00:09:05,923
Holy Shit.

318
00:09:06,030 --> 00:09:06,863
All right.

319
00:09:15,540 --> 00:09:15,590
Yeah.
