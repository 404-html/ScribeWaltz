1
00:00:04,380 --> 00:00:09,350
Dirty bitches. That's when
you saw him. You dirty bitch.

2
00:00:09,351 --> 00:00:13,980
And I need, I need a little, a
little more rhythm to pull it off.

3
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:19,590
The Joe Rogan experience podcast
today, Tuesday, September 4th,

4
00:00:19,590 --> 00:00:22,050
2012 because how the Blanco is dead.

5
00:00:24,020 --> 00:00:28,410
That's me. That's me. They got
that result of Blanca Lady,

6
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:32,710
who's that? She's the cocaine cowboys
lady. I still have not seen it.

7
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:35,190
I was talking about this. We'll
talk about this later. Um,

8
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:39,170
I got to do a commercial Charlie's
parents podcasts. It's broad,

9
00:00:39,171 --> 00:00:43,300
deep dye on it.com.
That's o and n I t what is on it?

10
00:00:43,310 --> 00:00:44,910
And it's to supplement company.

11
00:00:44,940 --> 00:00:49,110
We make Alpha brain and a bunch of shit
that I talk about on the podcast all the

12
00:00:49,111 --> 00:00:53,350
time. Uh, the one thing I can
tell you is everything that, uh,

13
00:00:53,490 --> 00:00:58,260
we sell it on a.com is all stuff that
I've used, I believe in. I endorse,

14
00:00:58,590 --> 00:01:01,230
I wouldn't get behind
anything that wasn't legit.

15
00:01:01,380 --> 00:01:05,850
And the fascinating thing to me about
Alpha brain is that it's a, you know,

16
00:01:05,851 --> 00:01:06,684
like all the,

17
00:01:07,110 --> 00:01:11,700
all the information from the tropics of
like you're interested in the subject of

18
00:01:11,710 --> 00:01:13,380
nootropics,
which is like,

19
00:01:13,410 --> 00:01:18,410
it's all nutrients that have been shown
to have a positive effect on human

20
00:01:18,470 --> 00:01:22,800
neurochemistry. The idea is that
you, your, your brain produces more,

21
00:01:23,260 --> 00:01:27,150
more juice. You have more ability
to string together sentences.

22
00:01:27,151 --> 00:01:31,230
You have more neurotransmitters.
I don't understand it.

23
00:01:31,231 --> 00:01:32,850
That shit goes away with time,

24
00:01:32,940 --> 00:01:37,860
your receptacles and all that stuff,
it starts to die away.

25
00:01:38,010 --> 00:01:41,550
Everything does. Or going
down, Greg, it's going down.

26
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:46,560
But what I've, what I've found
is that I benefit greatly from,

27
00:01:46,660 --> 00:01:48,590
I take a lot of vitamins and uh,

28
00:01:48,660 --> 00:01:52,860
I take a lot of really what I believe are
a very effective supplements and I eat

29
00:01:52,861 --> 00:01:55,530
a lot of really good food. You've got
to be healthy because if you don't,

30
00:01:55,531 --> 00:01:58,440
this motherfucker will fail on you.
It will fall apart.

31
00:01:58,441 --> 00:02:02,670
You'll crash into the rocks. Like
you've got to keep it together, bitches.

32
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:06,660
And that is what Ana is all about.
The company is basically set up.

33
00:02:06,690 --> 00:02:10,830
Everything we sell is stuff that will
improve you with the strength and fitness

34
00:02:10,831 --> 00:02:13,260
equipment,
kettle bells and battle ropes.

35
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:16,890
There's like the best way you could
ever work out if you want to develop

36
00:02:16,891 --> 00:02:21,540
functional strength, that directly
translates into any athletic endeavor.

37
00:02:21,541 --> 00:02:24,420
Kettle bells and battle
ropes are fantastic.

38
00:02:24,630 --> 00:02:28,500
Battle ropes are these giant fucking
ropes and he flail him through the air and

39
00:02:28,501 --> 00:02:32,190
you do it for like sprints of
30 seconds and oh, it's brutal.

40
00:02:32,790 --> 00:02:37,350
So those and kettle bells,
they will last you for to the end of time.

41
00:02:37,351 --> 00:02:37,951
The battle ropes,

42
00:02:37,951 --> 00:02:41,610
he can't give me any cheaper than you
can get it on [inaudible] dot com and the

43
00:02:41,611 --> 00:02:44,700
kettle bells, there's like as
cheap as you can humanly sell them.

44
00:02:44,910 --> 00:02:49,110
We're sending cannon balls through the
mail. It's not that easy. It's ridiculous.

45
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:51,480
I mean, that's where senator, I
mean some of them are 90 pounds.

46
00:02:51,481 --> 00:02:53,790
You're sending a 90 pound fucking
cannon ball through the mail.

47
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,820
That shit is expensive as fuck.
It's just like an Alpha brain.

48
00:02:56,821 --> 00:03:00,040
If you want to take the ropes and
make them yourself, go get a bunch of

49
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:04,000
ropes. It's really expensive.
You'd be amazed. Yeah. Those
really big, heavy, big,

50
00:03:04,001 --> 00:03:06,550
thick, heavy ropes. Those are
expensive as fuck. You know,

51
00:03:06,551 --> 00:03:09,760
it's not easy to target and you got
to go to a, you can get them though.

52
00:03:09,761 --> 00:03:13,660
You can go to nautical stores. I just
don't think they usually sell them in, in,

53
00:03:13,661 --> 00:03:17,110
in the length sizes. Yeah.
It's probably hard to get,

54
00:03:17,111 --> 00:03:20,050
but you can definitely get it. I
mean, we got it. And so just, uh,

55
00:03:20,070 --> 00:03:23,020
it's just a big heavy rope, you know,
if he can make your own, make your own.

56
00:03:23,050 --> 00:03:25,390
If you've got some extra
giant rope playing around,

57
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:27,130
he could probably do with chains too.

58
00:03:27,131 --> 00:03:32,131
If you want to go fucking crazy rampage
Jackson style or like 17,000 tennis

59
00:03:32,141 --> 00:03:34,090
shoes. Yeah. I mean, the idea is like the,

60
00:03:34,110 --> 00:03:39,040
you're using your whole body in like a
whipping effect in shoelaces. The wind,

61
00:03:39,130 --> 00:03:39,851
like the,
uh,

62
00:03:39,851 --> 00:03:44,170
the amount of a wind it takes to work
out what can do like these 32nd sprints,

63
00:03:44,171 --> 00:03:47,260
20 seconds off, and then 32nd
sprints. That's like, uh,

64
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:52,210
this protocol of different exercises you
do with the battles are fucking brutal,

65
00:03:52,211 --> 00:03:54,700
man. It's like nothing. It gets you tired.

66
00:03:54,701 --> 00:03:57,190
Like nothing ever do outside
of like wrestling a man.

67
00:03:58,990 --> 00:04:03,430
Not that you do any man wrestling. I
wrestled a rope man once. Rope, man,

68
00:04:03,460 --> 00:04:07,660
that was a fucking workout.
It's alive.

69
00:04:08,330 --> 00:04:11,660
Uh, the father off me off
a water bed when I was two.

70
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:18,020
Just kidding. You're the only grown man
that I know that still uses. Just kidding.

71
00:04:18,021 --> 00:04:21,250
I know.
What's,

72
00:04:21,420 --> 00:04:25,740
what's the source version of that? Yeah.
Like what's the adult version of that?

73
00:04:25,741 --> 00:04:29,240
Like you don't have to say no,
you're just kidding. I know.

74
00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:34,710
You know the original
one. No, no, no, no. Yeah.

75
00:04:34,711 --> 00:04:38,520
We might not to say that instead of like,
just kidding or not really.

76
00:04:38,790 --> 00:04:43,180
I think it was from, we were
like, you know, ten nine, oh,
I never am more committed.

77
00:04:43,220 --> 00:04:44,130
That's way better.

78
00:04:46,090 --> 00:04:49,750
Black people used to say it in
my town. They'd be like, Nah, no.

79
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:50,940
All right.

80
00:04:50,940 --> 00:04:55,680
That's my new thing now on at.com o
n n I t go get yourself some fucking

81
00:04:55,681 --> 00:04:57,840
Kettlebell.
Sun Hemp protein powder.

82
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:01,320
We've got all kinds of groovy shit and
it's all the supplements have a 30 day.

83
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:04,560
All right, 30 pill rather,
100% money back guarantee.

84
00:05:04,561 --> 00:05:08,100
If you don't feel like it enhances
you and helps you, then you just say,

85
00:05:08,101 --> 00:05:10,140
this stuff sucks and get your money back.
It's that simple.

86
00:05:10,141 --> 00:05:11,430
You don't have to return the product.

87
00:05:11,730 --> 00:05:16,110
Use the code name Brogan and you will
save yourself 10% off you dirty bitches.

88
00:05:16,410 --> 00:05:20,700
All right, Brian, cue the
music. Let's make it official.
Greg Fitzsimmons is here,

89
00:05:23,340 --> 00:05:24,810
Rogan experience,

90
00:05:25,410 --> 00:05:28,470
Joe Rogan podcast by night all day,

91
00:05:35,860 --> 00:05:38,740
and then that happens.
This is what happens.

92
00:05:38,741 --> 00:05:41,710
Every podcast you have these
fucking awesome conversations.

93
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:46,030
He'd get rolling and then we play that
music and all of a sudden we've got to

94
00:05:46,031 --> 00:05:48,980
start from scratch again and we forget
what we were just talking about that we

95
00:05:48,981 --> 00:05:51,280
were like saving for the podcast.
What were we talking? I said,

96
00:05:51,281 --> 00:05:55,360
we have a very inefficient way of starting
to show and we have never analyzed it

97
00:05:55,361 --> 00:05:58,250
until this moment and
have thought the best

98
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:03,500
like talk show like tonight show thing
would be as soon as the guests walk in

99
00:06:03,501 --> 00:06:05,090
the stage door backstage,

100
00:06:05,091 --> 00:06:09,990
they should just be getting filmed
and then play pieces of that. Yeah.

101
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:12,860
You know, cause who gives a shit?
Once they sit down, they tee it up.

102
00:06:13,070 --> 00:06:15,950
It's like I can tell you the
end of George Clooney story.

103
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:19,970
His mom made cookies and then uh,
she got hit on,

104
00:06:20,810 --> 00:06:23,510
Oh fuck,

105
00:06:25,340 --> 00:06:30,260
fuck about your pre packaged dry ass story
that you've done before. Or they talk,

106
00:06:30,470 --> 00:06:33,920
you know, me talk shows now
you see guys promoting a film.

107
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:37,580
There's this website that tells you all
the late night shows guests for the next

108
00:06:37,581 --> 00:06:42,440
two weeks and you'll see like Paul
Rudd go fucking daily show tonight.

109
00:06:42,441 --> 00:06:46,250
She'll Laderman cone and you know,
and then start working your way down.

110
00:06:46,251 --> 00:06:50,330
So you're on like a Jimmy, uh,
what's the guy who does a, the late,

111
00:06:50,331 --> 00:06:54,470
late NBC show? No, no, no,
no. It's like he does music.

112
00:06:54,530 --> 00:06:55,640
It was on MTV,

113
00:06:55,910 --> 00:07:00,500
not Jimmy Carson Daly.
Carson.

114
00:07:00,740 --> 00:07:05,420
Carson Daly is still on
television for 10 years.

115
00:07:05,450 --> 00:07:07,640
I like his taste.
I find a lot of weird,

116
00:07:07,641 --> 00:07:10,550
creepy bands and movies from
that guy just because he's,

117
00:07:10,710 --> 00:07:14,210
he's kind of like cutting edge
hipster. Like he, there's a reason why.

118
00:07:14,211 --> 00:07:16,220
Like he was on MTV,
our same generation.

119
00:07:16,310 --> 00:07:20,720
Now he's older so he does give some
cool tastes of music once in a while you

120
00:07:20,750 --> 00:07:23,090
watch it.
When I catch it I always,

121
00:07:23,091 --> 00:07:26,630
I'm interested cause he doesn't pick
little random cards out of the blue that

122
00:07:26,660 --> 00:07:30,710
you maybe you haven't heard of like
music wise, at least we're movie wise.

123
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:33,350
I don't know. I don't think
he's bad. I I'll take him over.

124
00:07:33,850 --> 00:07:38,360
Leno you no I never said he was bad.
She's fucking hard.

125
00:07:38,860 --> 00:07:42,070
Those things are really hard to do.
It's really hard to do.

126
00:07:42,071 --> 00:07:46,690
Is Talk Show like that. It'd be even
remotely interesting. It's so segmented.

127
00:07:46,930 --> 00:07:49,600
It's like you never really
get a chance to get rolling.

128
00:07:49,630 --> 00:07:53,830
You're just trying to like interject and
say witty things in this really brief

129
00:07:53,831 --> 00:07:57,940
story. It's like you barely get to
know someone like under the, the,

130
00:07:57,941 --> 00:07:59,080
the idea of this,

131
00:07:59,110 --> 00:08:03,390
this breaking it up and for these
long ass commercials and you know,

132
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:06,160
you talk in between the break and
then when we come back, you know,

133
00:08:06,161 --> 00:08:09,910
and then it just, it's so
fake and Hokey. You removed

134
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:14,570
yourself and the good guests just say,
you know what I'm going to do?

135
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:17,660
He's going to introduce me and I'm
going to tell a great fucking story.

136
00:08:17,690 --> 00:08:20,120
Then we're going to go to commercial.
But if you try to fake that,

137
00:08:20,121 --> 00:08:23,790
you're hanging out talking. That's,
that's torture. Special recording music.

138
00:08:23,810 --> 00:08:25,580
An Alienware computer, right? Yeah.

139
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:29,850
Yes. It's hard to do, man.
It's hard to do that job.

140
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:32,670
That's a really difficult job.
This is way easier.

141
00:08:32,940 --> 00:08:37,290
It's way easier to do a podcast. Like
there's a, yeah, yeah. Cause the podcast,

142
00:08:37,291 --> 00:08:41,400
you just start talking, you know,
a show like that. Like you have to,

143
00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:46,200
you have to operate within like
this really narrow frame of time.

144
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:49,560
Like what if this is like
a really intense subject,

145
00:08:50,730 --> 00:08:54,330
something that is a really controversial
to you and the person that you're

146
00:08:54,331 --> 00:08:56,610
talking about it with.
Sometimes it might require

147
00:08:56,610 --> 00:09:01,070
a long time to delicately work
through some weird subject I get.

148
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:04,080
The guy comes on it and he's talking
about his wife just had an abortion or

149
00:09:04,081 --> 00:09:09,050
something that could do it.
Yeah, it could. Yeah. Yeah.

150
00:09:09,390 --> 00:09:12,180
Well, you know, it's like there's,
there's certain things that when you're,

151
00:09:12,190 --> 00:09:15,810
you're talking about it, you need some
time. You don't want to have to go, uh,

152
00:09:15,930 --> 00:09:19,710
go to pre k and you know like, come
on. Really? Okay, we'll be back.

153
00:09:19,711 --> 00:09:21,090
Cause the host half

154
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:24,310
fill every second. You get uncomfortable
when the things not going well. So they,

155
00:09:24,460 --> 00:09:26,740
they jump in like some
dysfunctional enabler.

156
00:09:26,820 --> 00:09:30,840
Yeah. The commercial ruins
the conversation. It ruins it,

157
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:33,570
it fucking kills it.
It's the death of it.

158
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:36,770
And the idea that you have to do
a commercial at a certain time,

159
00:09:36,780 --> 00:09:40,020
like opie and Anthony have commercials,
but they just talk until they're done.

160
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:42,150
And then they go, all right, well
you guys want to take a break,

161
00:09:42,180 --> 00:09:44,310
let's take a break.
Placement commercials will write back.

162
00:09:44,430 --> 00:09:48,180
And it's completely organic. Yeah. It's
like you're watching separate shows.

163
00:09:48,181 --> 00:09:48,630
You're like,

164
00:09:48,630 --> 00:09:51,240
you're watching one hour and a half show
where they didn't go to commercial and

165
00:09:51,241 --> 00:09:54,150
then another hour show when they didn't
go to commercial and then they'll go to

166
00:09:54,151 --> 00:09:54,600
commercial.

167
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:59,600
Well and also you don't get the sense
with opie and Anthony or podcasts that

168
00:10:01,380 --> 00:10:03,880
we're talking the way
to human beings talk.

169
00:10:03,881 --> 00:10:08,220
There's a rhythm and there's a pace and
there's not, there's not high Iq moments.

170
00:10:08,221 --> 00:10:11,340
Every three seconds. Like when you
watch a monologue in an interview,

171
00:10:11,460 --> 00:10:15,750
you had 20 writers mapping every word.
So to me it's off putting,

172
00:10:15,751 --> 00:10:18,150
and I think it is to, a lot of
American sitcoms are the same way.

173
00:10:18,151 --> 00:10:21,600
Human beings don't have conversations
the way they do on sitcoms.

174
00:10:21,601 --> 00:10:25,830
So that's why people started wanting
reality TV. They were like, this shit is,

175
00:10:25,860 --> 00:10:28,170
makes me feel uncomfortable
because it's not real.

176
00:10:28,250 --> 00:10:32,360
Right? Yeah. It's, it's clumsy.

177
00:10:32,420 --> 00:10:35,660
It's like the way the president
talks to the, to the people,

178
00:10:35,900 --> 00:10:38,540
that's the same sort of thing.
It's the same sort of animal.

179
00:10:38,570 --> 00:10:40,730
It's like seeing gene Simmons on his show.

180
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:45,620
That's just an annoys the fuck out of
me because they stuffed, this is fake.

181
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:49,580
It's just a really dumb fake, like he
glued dildos to his hand, you know,

182
00:10:49,610 --> 00:10:53,870
like really like this. I have to believe
that you glued a Dildo to your hand.

183
00:10:53,900 --> 00:10:57,260
So unfortunate. Do you know, I guess
it's just trying to keep doing it.

184
00:10:57,350 --> 00:10:58,800
You know Bobby Lee, right? Sure.

185
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:02,650
Apparently. Uh, apparently he's
talking about this. I'm not,

186
00:11:02,651 --> 00:11:05,090
I'm not outing him about
this when he goes right.

187
00:11:05,230 --> 00:11:05,850
Pretty fine.

188
00:11:05,850 --> 00:11:10,500
How many times have people had to say that
statement in reference to a box store,

189
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:15,490
which I love. Bobby Lee
loved. I really do love truly.

190
00:11:15,770 --> 00:11:19,610
Well, you know why? Because he's Vaughn,
he's a broken toy and he knows it.

191
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:24,260
We all know it. So you don't have to. So
that's why I call him the story. He is,

192
00:11:24,261 --> 00:11:27,020
but he goes on the road, he buys
three bottles, a Elmers glue,

193
00:11:27,390 --> 00:11:31,580
and at night he pours it on his hands
and then peels it off. Are you serious?

194
00:11:31,581 --> 00:11:35,450
That's so cool. I heard that and I was
like, I want to fucking do that dude.

195
00:11:36,340 --> 00:11:38,090
You know those markers,
the crayola markers,

196
00:11:38,091 --> 00:11:41,720
you can bite off the end and
then take out the ink out of it.

197
00:11:41,721 --> 00:11:45,020
You put that in a glue overnight and
we'll turn whatever code, color marker.

198
00:11:45,021 --> 00:11:47,150
So you put it on your hand.
You can make it like green hall cans.

199
00:11:47,270 --> 00:11:49,940
So it looks you're peeling off.
Nice tip for Halloween.

200
00:11:51,190 --> 00:11:54,090
Yeah, you should. What are you 12 wrong

201
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:56,980
was wrong with you,
man.

202
00:11:57,620 --> 00:12:02,560
Like a stone labor action
show hole in his brain, folks.

203
00:12:02,950 --> 00:12:04,390
He took too much ecstasy.

204
00:12:04,391 --> 00:12:09,300
He's like that commercial where they
show the whole do a three d of his head.

205
00:12:09,340 --> 00:12:12,700
God, can we just talk about how it acts to
see, it's just so amazing. There you go.

206
00:12:12,701 --> 00:12:15,290
So I'm going to hone his brain around.

207
00:12:15,810 --> 00:12:20,530
Is this really breaks apart your life
in front of you? Like really accurately?

208
00:12:20,770 --> 00:12:24,460
Like it's really nice. It's if you, if
you talk about, I don't want to just help,

209
00:12:24,490 --> 00:12:26,890
don't do ecstasy, but in my opinion, uh,

210
00:12:27,060 --> 00:12:30,340
like if like mushrooms never really seemed
like they kind of helped me when I'm

211
00:12:30,341 --> 00:12:33,820
like, yeah, that's cool. If was look
like butterflies and stuff where exits,

212
00:12:33,821 --> 00:12:34,654
he actually kind of like,

213
00:12:34,870 --> 00:12:39,050
like almost like you're just start talking
about shit that's bugging you and he

214
00:12:39,060 --> 00:12:43,210
like, like I was really angry the other
day and I just kept on going like,

215
00:12:43,211 --> 00:12:46,840
why am I so angry? Everything
I'm saying is anger and it like,

216
00:12:46,841 --> 00:12:51,160
it really showed me immediately like
what was wrong with me at that point?

217
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:53,860
It was like a psychiatrist and a pill.
It was weird.

218
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:59,200
Have you done it much eval done once
or something budget at once? Yeah,

219
00:12:59,620 --> 00:13:03,790
it's don't do it, but
it's amazing. Amazing.

220
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:09,010
I had a,
I had a positive experience,

221
00:13:09,011 --> 00:13:10,330
like I learned something from it,

222
00:13:10,331 --> 00:13:13,570
but I also realized that
the physical toll yeah.

223
00:13:13,810 --> 00:13:17,500
Is a pretty substantial, yeah.
Your body takes a big flood.

224
00:13:17,501 --> 00:13:22,501
A lot of five HTP and a lot of counter
fucking XSE fix my brain juice and stuff.

225
00:13:23,770 --> 00:13:27,490
So I do it right. Like I've never,
the next day felt like shitty.

226
00:13:27,491 --> 00:13:30,490
Like lot of people wake up the next day
and feel depressed and they, you know,

227
00:13:30,820 --> 00:13:34,540
I've never felt that that was
originally how on it was conceived.

228
00:13:34,950 --> 00:13:36,610
Then roll on and roll off or what hills.

229
00:13:36,620 --> 00:13:41,620
Those are some of the first products and
the idea of being to help reboost your,

230
00:13:42,011 --> 00:13:46,990
your neurotransmitters have to
go on a binge. Yeah. I love them.

231
00:13:46,991 --> 00:13:51,400
Instead of us working towards
people, you know, becoming sober,

232
00:13:51,460 --> 00:13:54,770
we work toward fixes over juice.

233
00:13:55,700 --> 00:14:00,040
Just adopt change.
We just say it's too fun.

234
00:14:00,910 --> 00:14:04,580
It's too fun to not indulge
in my head, man. It's cold.

235
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:08,860
A liver cleanse or something. What's that?
Can you turn these down, turn you down?

236
00:14:09,700 --> 00:14:10,510
What's going on here?

237
00:14:10,510 --> 00:14:14,470
I feel like I'm at an ACDC concert except
it to you guys talking better? Yeah,

238
00:14:14,471 --> 00:14:17,620
that's great. Thank you. Thank you. Oh,
he's on a different channel or something.

239
00:14:18,130 --> 00:14:21,520
Well y'all ever separate volume chart.
It's crazy. That sounds so deep.

240
00:14:21,670 --> 00:14:24,490
We all have our own separate volume.
Well, who'd you have on last?

241
00:14:24,491 --> 00:14:26,050
They probably turned it up.
I don't remember.

242
00:14:26,710 --> 00:14:31,000
Whoever it was probably had come
in your ears. Whoa. How dare you.

243
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:37,480
How dare you? Silly boy. Yeah,

244
00:14:37,481 --> 00:14:40,200
that ecstasy on good for
you boy. Yeah. Alright.

245
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:41,710
Eventually it's going
to rot your head out.

246
00:14:41,830 --> 00:14:45,550
I literally do it once every four months.
Something like that.

247
00:14:45,551 --> 00:14:47,560
I don't do it like every
week or some crazy,

248
00:14:47,740 --> 00:14:50,710
but even once every four months you
PR that's hit and they kind of hard.

249
00:14:51,350 --> 00:14:52,100
Well they say that

250
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:56,180
it does fuck with your receptors
that you can't get happy.

251
00:14:56,181 --> 00:14:59,660
It's like same thing with opiates.
If you, if you take them too much,

252
00:15:00,050 --> 00:15:04,610
you clog up their receptors and the only
thing that gets through is the drug.

253
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:09,260
That's why it's so hard to get off of
those fucking pills I can get in is brutal

254
00:15:09,261 --> 00:15:10,290
to get off.
Oof.

255
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:12,900
I could easily just stock,
never do ecstasy again.

256
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:17,430
Real friends. Several people that I knew
and grew up with who became pill, pill,

257
00:15:17,490 --> 00:15:20,130
pill people. Yeah, I've seen it happen.

258
00:15:20,550 --> 00:15:24,720
I've seen people lose everything.
See them lose their shit for pills.

259
00:15:24,790 --> 00:15:27,940
Yeah. It's creepy weird rd. One

260
00:15:29,620 --> 00:15:34,240
he went from taking the pills cause it's
basically heroin. It's the same makeup.

261
00:15:34,270 --> 00:15:38,560
And then he couldn't, he didn't have
pills. One time at a club and some happy,

262
00:15:38,561 --> 00:15:41,910
little helpful doorman said,
well why don't you just snort some heroin?

263
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:43,000
I got some heroin and boom

264
00:15:43,310 --> 00:15:46,490
over. Wow, she's Christ.

265
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:52,960
I took a right shoulder surgery a couple
summers ago and they gave me Vicodin

266
00:15:52,980 --> 00:15:56,580
way too easily. You know, Revit.
My surgeon gave it to me. Then my,

267
00:15:56,581 --> 00:15:59,430
a general practitioner
gave it to me and uh,

268
00:15:59,431 --> 00:16:03,570
I had a supply gone and I took that shit
for six months. I was taking not a ton,

269
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:05,340
maybe three,
four a day,

270
00:16:05,700 --> 00:16:10,680
but it started to feel like when I didn't
have one I was not feeling good and

271
00:16:10,681 --> 00:16:15,300
then when I stopped it was some fuck
those toughest two days of my life.

272
00:16:15,490 --> 00:16:15,821
Yeah,

273
00:16:15,821 --> 00:16:19,720
I've heard that the withdrawal is like
almost some people they just can't take

274
00:16:19,721 --> 00:16:23,200
it. It's like a torture and they just quit
and they go back on the pills and say,

275
00:16:23,201 --> 00:16:25,270
you know, I'm, I'm just can't do it. Yeah.

276
00:16:26,350 --> 00:16:29,830
It's terrifying how
easy it is to get them.

277
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:33,750
It's terrifying how like quick
people are to take painkillers.

278
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:35,193
Yeah,

279
00:16:35,290 --> 00:16:38,940
I'm good. I mean I like drinking
more than any of this, you know,

280
00:16:38,941 --> 00:16:42,120
like I think that's just something
that I could relax, have a few drinks,

281
00:16:42,121 --> 00:16:43,440
feel good,
but I,

282
00:16:43,450 --> 00:16:48,150
I don't never got into having like
cocaine and it seems like that's just like

283
00:16:48,390 --> 00:16:51,180
once you, you do it once the next day
you wake up and you feel like, shit,

284
00:16:51,280 --> 00:16:52,740
I don't want to do that again.
You know?

285
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:55,280
Yeah.
Yeah.

286
00:16:55,800 --> 00:17:00,560
I don't get addiction of pills and I
think that opiate thing is a totally

287
00:17:00,561 --> 00:17:02,750
different monkey.
I think once it grabs you,

288
00:17:02,751 --> 00:17:07,751
it just grabs you by the balls and just
intertwines itself with your system.

289
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:11,480
When you get that monkey on your back,
that's a completely different experience.

290
00:17:11,481 --> 00:17:16,481
I think the opiate one seems to be
more of a intense physical experience.

291
00:17:17,420 --> 00:17:21,990
Yeah, it is. I'll tell you what, I've got
a friend who's been doing it for five,

292
00:17:21,991 --> 00:17:25,920
six, seven years. Very successful.
Screenwriter cannot write without it.

293
00:17:25,921 --> 00:17:27,930
When he take cause writing is a,

294
00:17:27,931 --> 00:17:32,931
it's scary and if you lose all your
fear and you write with abandoned,

295
00:17:33,810 --> 00:17:35,010
that's when you do good writing.

296
00:17:35,011 --> 00:17:38,160
So he started taking them because it
got him out of his writer's block.

297
00:17:38,580 --> 00:17:41,880
But now you start taking it just to get
normal. That's when you're in trouble.

298
00:17:41,940 --> 00:17:44,670
When you're not even getting hot,
you're just trying to crawl back.

299
00:17:45,260 --> 00:17:49,350
They're terrifying and
it's, you know, the people,

300
00:17:49,430 --> 00:17:51,840
and people will call me a hypocrite
because I smoked so much weed.

301
00:17:51,870 --> 00:17:53,450
Hypocrite if a current,

302
00:17:53,550 --> 00:17:58,550
but I can stop and take a week off
and I feel no physical effects.

303
00:17:59,900 --> 00:18:04,380
Like I did recently, went to Hawaii. I
didn't get high for a week. I didn't,

304
00:18:04,381 --> 00:18:07,980
I didn't bother me even a little bit.
It's like there's no withdrawal effects.

305
00:18:07,981 --> 00:18:11,460
There's nothing. I don't think
people understand that. I mean,

306
00:18:11,461 --> 00:18:14,920
some people think that there's some sort
of a psychological withdrawal effect

307
00:18:14,940 --> 00:18:18,030
that some people go through.
And then there's people that just,

308
00:18:18,031 --> 00:18:22,530
their body just completely behaves
differently than the normal person's body.

309
00:18:22,550 --> 00:18:26,180
Yeah. And they have much more of a
proclivity towards addiction. You know,

310
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:30,600
there's some people apparently that
like any sort of a change in a state of

311
00:18:30,601 --> 00:18:31,434
consciousness,

312
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:32,321
the brain,

313
00:18:32,321 --> 00:18:36,100
they can look at chemicals in the brain
and see an addictive brain in the way it

314
00:18:36,101 --> 00:18:37,090
behaves.
It's very different.

315
00:18:37,230 --> 00:18:41,460
It's fascinating. And so there are, I
mean, I would never say, I mean, look,

316
00:18:41,461 --> 00:18:45,700
some people die from eating peanuts.
You know, I would never say that mom,

317
00:18:45,750 --> 00:18:49,830
you know, my is my experience in, in
taking anything. It's the same as yours.

318
00:18:50,070 --> 00:18:50,970
So for some people,

319
00:18:50,971 --> 00:18:55,971
pop might just be this impossible
ride into the depths of hell.

320
00:18:56,310 --> 00:18:58,740
I mean, I don't know. I mean, and
then immediately they're hooked on it.

321
00:18:59,230 --> 00:19:04,170
It's not to me, but to someone's with
some really funky, weird genetics.

322
00:19:04,410 --> 00:19:07,560
Someone that can die from cranberries
or some shit. You know what I mean?

323
00:19:07,590 --> 00:19:08,940
Like one of those weird people.

324
00:19:09,130 --> 00:19:12,130
Oh, I mean, addiction in my
family, everybody. I mean, my dad,

325
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:17,110
my dad died at 51 basically
drinking and smoking and you know,

326
00:19:17,111 --> 00:19:20,920
three and a half packs a day. And
uh, I'm sorry, I hate hearing that.

327
00:19:21,140 --> 00:19:25,990
And aunts and uncles,
everybody's got addiction. So
I quit drinking 21 years ago.

328
00:19:26,530 --> 00:19:31,510
I was 25 years old when I quit drinking.
I remember Greg Pre and post.

329
00:19:31,570 --> 00:19:35,870
Yeah. Yeah. And it was like a, for
me it was like, I know I got to,

330
00:19:36,010 --> 00:19:40,990
so the addiction shifts, you go from one
thing to the next. And for me it was, uh,

331
00:19:41,020 --> 00:19:44,020
drinking,
went to working,

332
00:19:45,310 --> 00:19:49,450
went to sex.
And I really believe that.

333
00:19:49,780 --> 00:19:53,180
I don't know what a sex addict is. We
all want to fuck all the time. You know,

334
00:19:53,710 --> 00:19:54,490
what's,
what's the,

335
00:19:54,490 --> 00:19:58,420
what's the line you cross between
a healthy libido and sex addicts?

336
00:19:59,740 --> 00:20:01,750
You did.
And it was very unhealthy.

337
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:06,160
Like she did not leave the bed all day
and just wanted to fuck or masturbate all

338
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:06,390
day.

339
00:20:06,390 --> 00:20:07,260
Well,
some,

340
00:20:07,290 --> 00:20:12,290
some people are just trying to erase
whatever is fucking with their head.

341
00:20:13,110 --> 00:20:17,010
Some they're running horrible
vision from their past, you know,

342
00:20:17,011 --> 00:20:20,070
terrified memories, molestation,
whatever the fuck it is.

343
00:20:20,190 --> 00:20:24,120
Some people just trying to just
rub that out there. Just, you know,

344
00:20:24,121 --> 00:20:26,590
they're just trying to masturbate
to heighten their experience with,

345
00:20:26,591 --> 00:20:30,210
they don't have to think about that
for a brief moment. You know, there's,

346
00:20:30,211 --> 00:20:34,140
there's a lot of people out there that
we're fucked with when they were kids.

347
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:37,200
I mean, it's a, it's a
terrifying number. It really is.

348
00:20:37,330 --> 00:20:38,350
I kind of get wary to,

349
00:20:38,351 --> 00:20:42,760
when I see somebody who works way too
hard and never lets up on themselves,

350
00:20:42,761 --> 00:20:45,370
I always think you're fucking
hiding from something, you know,

351
00:20:45,371 --> 00:20:48,360
they're not no balance,
real relationship.

352
00:20:48,380 --> 00:20:52,490
It's just people can definitely get
crazy. They can, well, it's, it's,

353
00:20:52,550 --> 00:20:56,750
it's hard because you get so focused on
success and then you're dealing with a

354
00:20:56,751 --> 00:20:59,580
bunch of other ruthless motherfuckers
who are focused on success.

355
00:20:59,581 --> 00:21:02,450
So you have to like up
your game and that's,

356
00:21:02,470 --> 00:21:07,470
that's like the whole drive of modern
man and people get way Douchey or that

357
00:21:08,391 --> 00:21:08,720
way.

358
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:12,890
It's like you're responding to competing
against each other and you all do shit

359
00:21:12,891 --> 00:21:15,200
out.
Worse and worse do shit

360
00:21:15,790 --> 00:21:19,960
documentary called happy. You can get
it on Netflix and it's uh, it's like a,

361
00:21:20,410 --> 00:21:21,940
you know,
a very academic,

362
00:21:21,970 --> 00:21:26,530
quantifiable look at happiness
and how it transcends cultures.

363
00:21:26,531 --> 00:21:29,700
They started out showing this guy
in India who pulls a fucking wreck,

364
00:21:29,701 --> 00:21:33,280
Shaw and he lives in a tent with
his family and the guys, you know,

365
00:21:33,281 --> 00:21:35,380
it sounds fucking corny.
The Dude's happy, you know,

366
00:21:35,381 --> 00:21:38,950
they followed them and they interviewed
them and they say that 50% of your

367
00:21:38,951 --> 00:21:43,660
happiness is just your wiring.
You, here's your fucking DNA,

368
00:21:43,690 --> 00:21:46,150
here's the juices in your body.
Here's how people,

369
00:21:46,151 --> 00:21:48,400
like they showed a woman who'd
been run over by a truck,

370
00:21:48,401 --> 00:21:52,480
she was a beauty queen and her face is
fucking mangle. It's hard to look at her.

371
00:21:52,810 --> 00:21:56,620
And she returned to her happiness
level within a couple of years.

372
00:21:56,830 --> 00:22:00,460
Same thing with somebody who's depressed.
They can hit lotto within a year.

373
00:22:00,610 --> 00:22:03,130
They've settled back at their baseline.
So that's half.

374
00:22:03,490 --> 00:22:06,880
Then 20% is shit like
status, career, money,

375
00:22:07,300 --> 00:22:11,680
and then 30% is shit.
Like what you do flow,

376
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:15,770
getting into exercise, getting
into martial arts, getting
into, if you're a writer,

377
00:22:15,790 --> 00:22:17,380
getting lost in something,

378
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:22,680
that's the other 30% so you have to
strive to control that 30% by not letting

379
00:22:24,221 --> 00:22:29,221
the 20% get any bigger and
giving yourself the room to,

380
00:22:29,950 --> 00:22:33,880
you know, have that balance. And it seems
like exercise, like the number one thing.

381
00:22:35,300 --> 00:22:37,940
Yeah, that's a huge part. You've
got to keep your body alive.

382
00:22:38,380 --> 00:22:40,970
How to keep it moving.
He could keep stressing it.

383
00:22:41,180 --> 00:22:43,340
Got to keep making it keep regenerating.

384
00:22:43,370 --> 00:22:48,320
He keeps sending impulses into it.
Firing your hormonal system,

385
00:22:48,321 --> 00:22:50,000
going to,
you got to force herself to work.

386
00:22:50,540 --> 00:22:53,840
If you don't force your body to work
and wants to just give the fuck up,

387
00:22:53,841 --> 00:22:56,550
you use it or lose it.
But they say the same thing with,

388
00:22:56,570 --> 00:22:57,560
I was saying before how they,

389
00:22:57,770 --> 00:23:02,540
this is where I heard about this in
a documentary about how your, uh,

390
00:23:02,541 --> 00:23:04,100
what are the chemicals
that make you happy again?

391
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:07,660
Yeah.
Your endorphin receptors start to dry out.

392
00:23:07,900 --> 00:23:11,050
They start to die and the more
you use them, the less they die.

393
00:23:11,051 --> 00:23:14,950
So they say try different activities,
learn a new language, try a new sport,

394
00:23:14,951 --> 00:23:16,390
travel somewhere.
You haven't been

395
00:23:20,210 --> 00:23:21,043
navy.

396
00:23:22,060 --> 00:23:26,900
I don't discount the idea of any like
really big. So I dog experience for,

397
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:31,190
for helping you. I've, I've, I've learned
a lot about myself doing them, you know,

398
00:23:31,191 --> 00:23:35,840
and he and the regular one that I do
have the isolation tank to start just

399
00:23:35,841 --> 00:23:40,210
getting high and getting that thing, you
know, it's, it's mind blowing enough.

400
00:23:40,420 --> 00:23:45,110
You know, I have, I have some pretty
intense visionary experiences doing,

401
00:23:45,270 --> 00:23:45,980
do you remember them?

402
00:23:45,980 --> 00:23:47,540
Clearly?
Some of them.

403
00:23:47,750 --> 00:23:52,400
Some of them I remember really clearly
the one of talked about it before.

404
00:23:52,401 --> 00:23:56,120
It's so retarded. But uh, it
did, it really did happen.

405
00:23:56,150 --> 00:24:01,150
I was in the jungle and I was walking
through the jungle and there was a bunch

406
00:24:01,311 --> 00:24:02,030
of people,

407
00:24:02,030 --> 00:24:07,030
we were barefoot and they were
talking and I knew their language.

408
00:24:07,491 --> 00:24:11,060
I understood what they were saying.
The language was not English,

409
00:24:11,090 --> 00:24:12,200
it was a different language.

410
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:15,980
They were talking and I understood
it in their language in my head.

411
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:20,270
And then I freaked out and then I said,
what the fuck am I?

412
00:24:20,271 --> 00:24:24,230
And then when I freaked out, I spelled
it out to myself like in English,

413
00:24:24,231 --> 00:24:26,510
like what the fuck am I doing?

414
00:24:26,750 --> 00:24:31,750
I am listening to a language and I
understand it in that language but I said

415
00:24:33,651 --> 00:24:37,650
that in English and then I snapped out
of it and woke up and it was the co

416
00:24:37,651 --> 00:24:42,651
repeal this thing because just like when
you have this conversation with me and

417
00:24:43,641 --> 00:24:46,160
I know exactly what you're
saying cause I speak English,

418
00:24:46,490 --> 00:24:50,150
I knew exactly what they were
saying but it was not English,

419
00:24:50,151 --> 00:24:51,740
but I knew what the intent was.

420
00:24:51,740 --> 00:24:55,220
I knew exactly what they were saying and
I understood it in their own language.

421
00:24:55,880 --> 00:24:59,240
It was freaky as fuck cause it's so real.

422
00:24:59,410 --> 00:25:01,180
So you had two selves in a way.

423
00:25:01,181 --> 00:25:05,560
There was the guy watching
the guy speaking the language,
standing, observing. Yes.

424
00:25:05,820 --> 00:25:09,630
Yes, yes. Well that's what woke me
up out of it. I couldn't stay in it.

425
00:25:09,660 --> 00:25:13,890
It was so crazy that I couldn't stay in
it. It was just, it was like what I was,

426
00:25:13,910 --> 00:25:16,800
I wasn't capable of
holding the hallucination.

427
00:25:17,020 --> 00:25:18,160
You ever think about that though?

428
00:25:18,161 --> 00:25:22,150
Because I think that that has a lot to
do with maybe happiness or maybe Saturday

429
00:25:22,151 --> 00:25:24,730
is that we all do have a couple of voices.

430
00:25:24,731 --> 00:25:28,480
You have the guide judging yourself
and then you have your id, you know,

431
00:25:28,481 --> 00:25:32,830
your animal impulses. And uh, you know,
Freud would say it's like your, you know,

432
00:25:32,831 --> 00:25:33,370
your,

433
00:25:33,370 --> 00:25:38,370
your ego and your super ego and that
basically you are observing yourself all

434
00:25:40,571 --> 00:25:44,160
the time and the guy that's
observing you is the fucking asshole.

435
00:25:44,170 --> 00:25:47,920
He's the one that socializing you and
getting you to do what's appropriate,

436
00:25:48,040 --> 00:25:52,090
which you need to a certain degree.
But the balance within that,

437
00:25:52,091 --> 00:25:55,960
I think it's the distance between
the two voices. Uh, you know,

438
00:25:55,961 --> 00:25:58,750
obviously if he completely
became transcendent, maybe,

439
00:25:58,751 --> 00:26:03,751
maybe the Dalai Lama has one voice and
how close can you get those voices?

440
00:26:05,170 --> 00:26:10,170
Hmm. Really close. Yeah.
Well you know, you,

441
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:12,870
there is the momentum
live and then there's the,

442
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:16,410
every now and then you are like objective
assessment of the life that you're

443
00:26:16,411 --> 00:26:18,900
living on momentum.
Like sometimes you're just,

444
00:26:18,930 --> 00:26:23,760
life is on momentum for like long
slides and then you need like another

445
00:26:23,761 --> 00:26:27,970
perspective on yourself.
You need to go, what's,

446
00:26:27,990 --> 00:26:30,300
it's going to slow down?
What's going on here buddy?

447
00:26:30,810 --> 00:26:33,480
How are you really thinking
how you really live in?

448
00:26:33,510 --> 00:26:37,980
I think that those reset
situations they can get in life,

449
00:26:38,010 --> 00:26:42,240
whether they're a strong yoga class, you
know, whether it's, uh, you know, right.

450
00:26:42,330 --> 00:26:46,890
The why that I could do it too.
It can be extra. Fuck. Yeah.

451
00:26:47,010 --> 00:26:50,040
We could realize like, Holy
Shit, I'm a fucking loser.

452
00:26:50,280 --> 00:26:53,550
I'm out there driving
drunk. Yeah. For sure.

453
00:26:53,551 --> 00:26:58,551
That could fucking snap you over into
a realistic perspective on what you're,

454
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:02,240
and the other voice then steps up those,

455
00:27:02,260 --> 00:27:04,750
those little epiphany is going to happen.
And then all of a sudden that,

456
00:27:04,870 --> 00:27:08,440
that guy that was in the flow, it's
like, dude, get in the back seat.

457
00:27:08,530 --> 00:27:11,260
I got the wheel for a little while. You're
going to get it back on the road here.

458
00:27:12,340 --> 00:27:16,600
You know? And it's like,
uh, you know, for me,

459
00:27:16,810 --> 00:27:21,790
having a wife and kids, uh, and not
drinking, I don't have much escape.

460
00:27:21,850 --> 00:27:24,010
So I really do struggle with that.

461
00:27:24,011 --> 00:27:27,280
Like the guy that's telling me to do
the right thing and I realized I drive a

462
00:27:27,281 --> 00:27:30,970
fucking Prius. I have college
savings accounts for my kids.

463
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:34,840
I fucking exercise.
Like it's great stuff,

464
00:27:34,841 --> 00:27:39,190
but there's a part of me that feels
like that animal inside, you know,

465
00:27:39,191 --> 00:27:43,310
and I'm not going to fuck around,
you know, I'm not going to drink. Uh,

466
00:27:43,330 --> 00:27:45,880
so I try to find other ways and part,

467
00:27:45,881 --> 00:27:49,480
part of it is just being a clown when
I'm out with my wife, I fuck around,

468
00:27:49,481 --> 00:27:52,690
but everybody parking
attendant, waiter, I just,

469
00:27:52,691 --> 00:27:55,810
to me it's like being out with her and
having fun as a fucking greatest and

470
00:27:55,811 --> 00:27:58,710
making her embarrassed and she protest,

471
00:27:58,711 --> 00:28:01,480
but she loves it and that's a
relationship. Know really funny.

472
00:28:01,481 --> 00:28:04,630
That sounds like fun. That's
what I was looking for him. Yeah.

473
00:28:04,631 --> 00:28:08,260
I put a Napkin on my head at a restaurant
last week and she actually got mad at

474
00:28:08,261 --> 00:28:11,030
me because I wouldn't take it off.
It was like a really nice restaurant.

475
00:28:13,790 --> 00:28:17,840
I want to see this such a,
it's Simmons sense of humor moment.

476
00:28:21,130 --> 00:28:24,240
You just love,
just love being able to do that though.

477
00:28:24,410 --> 00:28:27,500
Do it. And realize that you are
so different from me. That's what,

478
00:28:27,501 --> 00:28:29,000
that's what you're saying.
Cause she grew up,

479
00:28:29,001 --> 00:28:32,380
she grew up in New York City in a fucking
not a great neighborhood and she's

480
00:28:32,381 --> 00:28:36,350
sophisticated chick. You know, she
got her masters in social work and,

481
00:28:36,351 --> 00:28:40,550
and you know,
but she's not wild at all.

482
00:28:40,551 --> 00:28:43,670
She's very dressed down.
But she accepts me because she's been,

483
00:28:43,671 --> 00:28:47,510
she grew up around insanity. Right, right,
right. So it's a perfect combination.

484
00:28:47,511 --> 00:28:51,380
And she read, she reigns me in
peacefully. She's not a nagging wife,

485
00:28:51,381 --> 00:28:52,580
she's not a ballbuster,

486
00:28:52,760 --> 00:28:57,470
but she is almost that other voice
that gently I just watch her and she

487
00:28:57,471 --> 00:29:01,160
peacefully brings me back into my
kids. You know, sometimes, you know,

488
00:29:01,161 --> 00:29:01,994
sometimes you,

489
00:29:02,030 --> 00:29:05,480
you go away and you come back and you
see your kid and it's like you're not

490
00:29:05,481 --> 00:29:10,100
connected and you gotta you
gotta work your way back in.
And she's like, my guide,

491
00:29:10,101 --> 00:29:11,510
she brings me back into it.

492
00:29:11,900 --> 00:29:14,490
That's awesome man. Yeah. If
you can find someone, you,

493
00:29:14,491 --> 00:29:16,700
you just Joe with them and
you enhance each other.

494
00:29:16,701 --> 00:29:20,570
That's what relationships are all about.
The, I mean that's what we all hope for,

495
00:29:20,630 --> 00:29:25,580
but it's the crazy thing is how rare that
is. What it's worth too. I don't think.

496
00:29:25,581 --> 00:29:28,100
Sure. Not a perfect soulmate.
It's you know, but I mean,

497
00:29:28,101 --> 00:29:32,090
how many people do you know that are
truly happy in their relationship?

498
00:29:32,130 --> 00:29:35,930
Oops. What is the percentage, you know,

499
00:29:35,940 --> 00:29:37,440
how many people do you
know that are struggling?

500
00:29:38,610 --> 00:29:42,010
How many people you know
that fight a rally? Half.
Probably the married couples I

501
00:29:42,010 --> 00:29:45,070
know really like have a like to the
point where they say it out loud.

502
00:29:45,071 --> 00:29:45,930
It's a thing.
Yeah.

503
00:29:46,210 --> 00:29:48,400
Yeah. I would say that you're,
yeah, I would agree with you.

504
00:29:48,460 --> 00:29:51,880
I think the people that I come
in contact with, it's about half,

505
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:54,480
half of them seem like nice couple,
look at that.

506
00:29:54,490 --> 00:29:57,340
They seem friendly and seemed like they
enjoyed each other's company and then

507
00:29:57,341 --> 00:30:01,210
half of them snipe at
each other and you know,

508
00:30:01,211 --> 00:30:04,870
and they do it right in front
of you. Oh man, that's so rude.

509
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:07,600
You know what I'm doing. You know
what I'm doing. Just stop it. Stop it.

510
00:30:07,601 --> 00:30:11,050
Now do you see what he does? You see
it right? This is what I deal with.

511
00:30:11,410 --> 00:30:13,420
Oh,

512
00:30:14,590 --> 00:30:18,460
those relationships are ruthless to
watch man. Cause that's out in public.

513
00:30:18,461 --> 00:30:21,610
You can imagine what it's like
behind closed doors. You know.

514
00:30:22,810 --> 00:30:27,810
Did you see that video of a basketball
player who was a first round draft pick?

515
00:30:29,050 --> 00:30:29,980
Did you see that Brian,

516
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:35,170
the dude beat his girlfriend up
and did it on camera. Oh yeah. Yes.

517
00:30:35,210 --> 00:30:37,790
Prep his daughter.
Like was it in front of his daughters?

518
00:30:37,990 --> 00:30:41,230
Were a little girl there. Are you talking
about like he reached over the fence?

519
00:30:41,410 --> 00:30:43,770
No, no, no, no. This was um, it was,

520
00:30:44,050 --> 00:30:49,050
it looked like it was like some sort
of a hotel or a or a apartment lobby or

521
00:30:50,691 --> 00:30:53,710
something like that somewhere where they
had a security camera wherever it was.

522
00:30:53,920 --> 00:30:56,140
He's this big fucking dude,

523
00:30:56,170 --> 00:30:58,930
big super athlete basketball player.

524
00:30:59,410 --> 00:31:04,330
And he like kicks her to the ground
and smacks her in the head and you're

525
00:31:04,331 --> 00:31:07,720
watching us. It's terrifying.
She's really little man.

526
00:31:07,730 --> 00:31:12,730
She's not a big person and he is giant
and apparently he just beat her ass and

527
00:31:15,520 --> 00:31:18,670
they sentenced him to a
bunch of different shit. Man.

528
00:31:19,030 --> 00:31:21,700
They sentenced him to like all told,

529
00:31:21,701 --> 00:31:26,680
I think he has to go to jail for like
three years. And uh, yeah. And he,

530
00:31:26,710 --> 00:31:31,180
he just, when he probably dropped
the fucking $20 million contract,

531
00:31:31,370 --> 00:31:35,740
you should see the video to the video
is crazy. He collapses in the courtroom,

532
00:31:36,670 --> 00:31:40,900
collapses and it was like,
oh no, no, no, no, no.

533
00:31:41,710 --> 00:31:46,060
Fell down. Collabed I mean it was,
it was really fucking intense.

534
00:31:47,110 --> 00:31:48,070
It's terrifying.
I mean,

535
00:31:48,071 --> 00:31:50,830
he realized that he was going to
go to jail for three fucking years.

536
00:31:51,070 --> 00:31:54,460
You know what sucks about that is that
ain't gonna change the dude and that

537
00:31:54,461 --> 00:31:57,640
ain't going to change any other
domestic abuser putting people in jail.

538
00:31:57,790 --> 00:32:00,730
It's like, why isn't
there more like, you know,

539
00:32:00,731 --> 00:32:04,060
especially in the inner city where you
see people with less father figures and

540
00:32:04,061 --> 00:32:05,500
you see more violence to,

541
00:32:05,700 --> 00:32:10,630
to really make it a part of schools
that you learn how to respect women,

542
00:32:10,631 --> 00:32:13,870
how to respect, you
know, the opposite sex.

543
00:32:13,871 --> 00:32:17,290
Because it is something that
is cyclical and it is cultural.

544
00:32:17,320 --> 00:32:21,490
You see a higher instance of domestic
abuse with poor people and you know that

545
00:32:21,491 --> 00:32:24,100
should jail doesn't change that shit.
It just causes more anger.

546
00:32:24,370 --> 00:32:28,150
Yeah. It, it, it's not like it's a great
place where they're going to, you know,

547
00:32:28,151 --> 00:32:32,260
sit around and do Iowasca and find
their spirits of realize where they went

548
00:32:32,261 --> 00:32:36,850
wrong and the path to enlightenment
surrounded by dudes. Yeah. It's a mess.

549
00:32:36,910 --> 00:32:37,900
The whole idea is a mess.

550
00:32:37,901 --> 00:32:41,400
And then you get into the
fact that there's private
prisons in this country and

551
00:32:41,410 --> 00:32:46,410
that that's one of the most mind boggling
facts about American culture and just

552
00:32:48,381 --> 00:32:50,630
makes you wonder like,
what is,

553
00:32:51,170 --> 00:32:54,350
what is the intention of the people
running this fucking place where they've

554
00:32:54,351 --> 00:32:57,920
allowed so they got vacancies,
they're losing money.

555
00:32:58,190 --> 00:33:00,650
You gotta fucking get some
reservation people out there.

556
00:33:00,830 --> 00:33:04,430
That's what the cop side, their
reservation is for the prisons. Yeah.

557
00:33:05,570 --> 00:33:08,960
It's almost like that, huh?
Yeah. It's funny that like the,

558
00:33:08,961 --> 00:33:13,940
the police officer's unions will
actually, uh, lobby and vote.

559
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:18,740
They like try to make sure that certain
drugs aren't made legal and like they

560
00:33:18,741 --> 00:33:22,820
have a, Oh shit. Yeah,
sure. It makes sense. Yeah.

561
00:33:22,821 --> 00:33:26,300
Police officers in unions or not
police officer's unit, but um, uh,

562
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:29,810
what would they call them? What did they
call the people that worked at jails,

563
00:33:30,440 --> 00:33:32,330
corrections officers,
corrections officers,

564
00:33:34,190 --> 00:33:35,450
corrections officers.

565
00:33:35,920 --> 00:33:40,910
They will actually like use their money
and influence to try to make sure the

566
00:33:40,911 --> 00:33:45,470
drugs stay illegal. Speaking
of which, number one, domestic
abusers in the country,

567
00:33:46,040 --> 00:33:50,780
corrections officers. Really, Jesus
Christ, super high rate of alcoholism.

568
00:33:50,840 --> 00:33:55,220
Or I read this book about singers. It's
a terrible job. It's terrible for them,

569
00:33:55,221 --> 00:33:57,930
man. I mean, I don't have anything
against corrections officers. I,

570
00:33:58,280 --> 00:34:00,050
it's a terrible place to be,

571
00:34:00,230 --> 00:34:04,250
to be just completely surrounded by
people who are locked in a cage and you're

572
00:34:04,251 --> 00:34:04,671
not,

573
00:34:04,671 --> 00:34:08,570
and you walk amongst them all the time
and they can just take a fucking free run

574
00:34:08,571 --> 00:34:12,900
at you at any moment. You live your life
and constant stress. Yeah. Yeah. I don't,

575
00:34:12,920 --> 00:34:14,930
I don't envy them by any
stretch of the imagination.

576
00:34:14,931 --> 00:34:18,710
I think that if you're going
to really take, being, uh,

577
00:34:19,070 --> 00:34:22,640
putting someone in a jail
and reform seriously,

578
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:26,180
you're going to have to come up with a
way better method than what they're doing.

579
00:34:26,690 --> 00:34:30,460
This is ridiculous because this is
a reforming anybody, there was a,

580
00:34:30,530 --> 00:34:31,980
I read this book about Sing Sing.

581
00:34:31,981 --> 00:34:36,981
This journalists went undercover as a
prison guard for two years and he came out

582
00:34:37,401 --> 00:34:39,530
of it.
He divorced his wife,

583
00:34:39,680 --> 00:34:43,100
he was an alcoholic and he was living
in a fucking one bedroom shack.

584
00:34:43,670 --> 00:34:48,410
His whole life fell apart and he said
that the, the alcoholism on the inside,

585
00:34:48,440 --> 00:34:50,270
he said, it's just end.
It becomes consuming.

586
00:34:50,570 --> 00:34:53,540
It becomes a challenge that you
take with you when you leave work.

587
00:34:53,541 --> 00:34:56,420
It's not you go to your job,
you finish and then you go have your life.

588
00:34:56,420 --> 00:35:00,950
It becomes these motherfuckers and I'm
going to do this and it eats you up.

589
00:35:01,250 --> 00:35:05,870
You become part of it. Yeah.
Human beings are weird as fuck.

590
00:35:06,110 --> 00:35:11,110
Trying to figure out how our behavior
lends us astray or leads us astray rather

591
00:35:13,370 --> 00:35:17,900
and how we can try to get it back on
track if it's at all even possible like as

592
00:35:17,901 --> 00:35:21,490
a, as a group of us. It's like
when you look at the, the,

593
00:35:21,500 --> 00:35:26,500
the just the massive amount of crazy
human momentum type behavior where we're

594
00:35:27,441 --> 00:35:28,880
just on our momentum.
Like,

595
00:35:29,060 --> 00:35:32,660
here's the thing in New York where they
had to recently pass something that

596
00:35:32,661 --> 00:35:37,160
makes rabbis have to get consent
first before they suck your kids.

597
00:35:37,170 --> 00:35:41,310
Dick suck. Yes. Do you know
when you circumcise a child,

598
00:35:41,340 --> 00:35:45,510
the rabbi that traditionally will suck
upon the boy's penis to stop the bleeding

599
00:35:45,540 --> 00:35:49,530
now? Yes, yes, yes. This is all Jewish.

600
00:35:50,370 --> 00:35:54,270
I don't know what sect of Judaism. I don't
really care what they call themselves.

601
00:35:54,510 --> 00:35:58,530
Whatever. Silly people do
this. It's real. It's they've,

602
00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:03,090
they've had babies die in very recent
times because the baby will get herpes

603
00:36:03,091 --> 00:36:07,220
from the mouth of the, the whatever.
I think they called them. Loyal. Yeah.

604
00:36:07,221 --> 00:36:09,600
Sense of tradition.
There's a guy that's like,

605
00:36:09,630 --> 00:36:14,490
there's this nutty fucking video of this
guy defending it and he explains it in,

606
00:36:14,491 --> 00:36:19,190
in the, the word, the Hebrew word,
which means to suck like that.

607
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:23,160
It's strictly says if that's how
you're supposed to deal with that.

608
00:36:23,340 --> 00:36:26,190
So that's what they're doing. So,
and you're just discounting my,

609
00:36:26,191 --> 00:36:29,490
my thought is that you're just discounting
that this fucking baby's not going to

610
00:36:29,491 --> 00:36:31,590
remember this experience.
You know?

611
00:36:31,591 --> 00:36:35,400
How do we not know that that's some
nightmare in the back of his mind,

612
00:36:35,640 --> 00:36:38,560
like constantly fucking with them.
They did.

613
00:36:38,830 --> 00:36:43,020
Cutting the Dick is where it starts
cutting a deck and then sucking it. It's,

614
00:36:43,021 --> 00:36:46,650
it's, you know, they say tannic shit.
It's, it's tribal. It's fucking,

615
00:36:46,651 --> 00:36:49,260
and it all goes back to shit.
It's like,

616
00:36:49,261 --> 00:36:53,370
you know that the American
Medical Association no longer
recommend circumcisions

617
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:57,900
in third world countries they do
to prevent aids and uh, other, uh,

618
00:36:58,010 --> 00:37:02,450
that's never got that. How is getting
your dick cut going to prevail?

619
00:37:02,460 --> 00:37:05,950
It used to be because the,
the fold around the crowd would that good.

620
00:37:06,210 --> 00:37:10,680
You're going to get aids that way.
Really? Really? It's so ridiculous.

621
00:37:10,681 --> 00:37:14,060
I think it gets infected more because
there's shit that gets in there like wash

622
00:37:14,070 --> 00:37:16,740
your Dick. You don't get it.
That's my point. We got running.

623
00:37:17,130 --> 00:37:21,030
People can't even wash the, Oh, so
because we don't have running water.

624
00:37:21,031 --> 00:37:25,340
They're getting aids through. They're
there for skins, which is true. Therefore,

625
00:37:25,410 --> 00:37:28,680
skin makes aids. Well, anything
that folds back around the gland,

626
00:37:28,681 --> 00:37:32,040
like a vagina basically collects way
more diseases than a penis. You know,

627
00:37:32,041 --> 00:37:37,041
like men don't catch aids almost ever
so straight up sex with a woman who has

628
00:37:38,131 --> 00:37:42,210
aids. But if you've got a vagina, you've
got a really good chance of getting aids.

629
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:43,560
If you have sex with somebody,

630
00:37:43,950 --> 00:37:48,840
if you have any kind of tear in your
vaginal wall or ceilings or floors or

631
00:37:48,841 --> 00:37:52,530
shades or blinds, your lips, oo, slats.

632
00:37:53,730 --> 00:37:54,270
Uh,

633
00:37:54,270 --> 00:37:58,200
do you know that there's a doctor who
doesn't believe that it's terrifying when

634
00:37:58,201 --> 00:38:00,990
someone,
when you're too stupid to know who's dumb

635
00:38:03,660 --> 00:38:05,550
because there's this guy who's a,
uh,

636
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:10,290
his name is Dr Peter Duesberg and I've
read all his stuff and I know that he's a

637
00:38:12,030 --> 00:38:15,510
professor of biology. I believe the
University of California Berkeley.

638
00:38:15,900 --> 00:38:17,730
It's like a legit guy.

639
00:38:18,120 --> 00:38:23,120
And his whole idea is that
HIV is not what causes AIDS.

640
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:23,731
Oh yeah.

641
00:38:23,731 --> 00:38:27,630
I heard about the president of South
Africa said the same fact titty really the

642
00:38:27,631 --> 00:38:28,870
biggest aids country.

643
00:38:28,970 --> 00:38:32,270
And the other way I met HIV before and I
was talking about transmitting diseases.

644
00:38:32,280 --> 00:38:32,660
Nowadays,

645
00:38:32,660 --> 00:38:37,660
I am way too stupid to understand who's
right and who's wrong then because

646
00:38:37,901 --> 00:38:41,800
obviously there's a bunch of geneticists
and a bunch of disease specialist who

647
00:38:41,801 --> 00:38:45,610
completely disagree with him and
they think that HIV does cause aids.

648
00:38:45,880 --> 00:38:49,930
I wish I was smart enough to know what
the fuck who's where. It's ridiculous.

649
00:38:50,360 --> 00:38:54,680
Well it's all shit happening
at a molecular level. It's
all, it's all guesses.

650
00:38:54,681 --> 00:38:55,280
It's,

651
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:59,600
but it's percentages and if you say that
when we see these symptoms of a immune

652
00:38:59,601 --> 00:39:02,870
deficiencies happening and people there
have lesions in her losing weight,

653
00:39:03,080 --> 00:39:06,330
then we often find that before
that they, you know, uh, that,

654
00:39:06,331 --> 00:39:10,310
that the immune leads to the lesions
and all of the outbreak of aid.

655
00:39:10,311 --> 00:39:15,311
So why not play those odds since we'll
never know the actual truth if there even

656
00:39:15,321 --> 00:39:15,780
is one.

657
00:39:15,780 --> 00:39:20,130
Do you think that's what they're doing?
I what Duisburg is saying is that there,

658
00:39:20,131 --> 00:39:24,570
it's linked to partying. What he's
saying is that it's a dude's do like, um,

659
00:39:24,630 --> 00:39:28,380
math and go crazy poppers,
poppers and Emile nitrates.

660
00:39:28,620 --> 00:39:32,020
Apparently those poppers are
unbelievably bad for you. Like,

661
00:39:32,110 --> 00:39:37,110
like instant brain damage and that doing
that partying on a regular basis like

662
00:39:39,211 --> 00:39:41,220
that just wrecks your immune system.

663
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:41,640
Well that's,

664
00:39:41,640 --> 00:39:44,490
I mean it's why third world countries
get aids more is because when you're

665
00:39:44,491 --> 00:39:47,950
malnourished and your system is worn down,
you Terry easier,

666
00:39:48,280 --> 00:39:53,010
your tissues break open and your immune
system can't fight back as much. So it's,

667
00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:54,480
you know, it's, it's about, you know,

668
00:39:54,481 --> 00:39:57,870
wealthy countries get it less because
they're fucking, they're in better shape.

669
00:39:58,520 --> 00:40:02,300
So you, what you think is at HIV
is something that can be avoided.

670
00:40:03,270 --> 00:40:04,080
I think it,
it,

671
00:40:04,080 --> 00:40:08,490
I think the likelihood of getting it as
increased when your system is worn down

672
00:40:08,491 --> 00:40:11,190
and you're malnourished and uh,
you know,

673
00:40:11,220 --> 00:40:15,090
you don't have enough fluids in you then
you tear and that's where the, uh, you,

674
00:40:15,120 --> 00:40:18,420
you have more cuts around
you because your, your skin,

675
00:40:18,421 --> 00:40:20,430
everything is just not as elastic

676
00:40:20,670 --> 00:40:22,550
frog.
And that's all coming from sex.

677
00:40:22,551 --> 00:40:25,350
That it's just completely
sexually transmitted. Yeah.

678
00:40:25,351 --> 00:40:28,620
You put a penis and a vagina and you rub
it back and forth and something tears

679
00:40:28,621 --> 00:40:32,340
and then the semen gets
in there. Boom. HIV.

680
00:40:32,740 --> 00:40:35,550
Remember when you were a kid, you thought
everybody would be dead of AIDS by now.

681
00:40:35,610 --> 00:40:39,690
I now we were convinced we
caught the wave. We got fucked.

682
00:40:39,750 --> 00:40:43,250
Who got scared? Remember you get,
do you ever remember what uh,

683
00:40:43,320 --> 00:40:47,360
happened the first time we took an
aids test? Yes. Did you panic? Yeah,

684
00:40:47,390 --> 00:40:52,390
I fuck and panic because it's like a
24 hour wait a fucking bannock man.

685
00:40:54,190 --> 00:40:59,190
I fucking had panicked or thought about
some weird drunk nights on the road as a

686
00:41:00,871 --> 00:41:05,430
20 year old, 21 year old.
Come on man. I had to,

687
00:41:05,431 --> 00:41:09,600
I caught gonorrhea once. I
crossed the chlamydia green.

688
00:41:09,601 --> 00:41:12,450
When you pa like his ass,
it hurts.

689
00:41:12,780 --> 00:41:16,980
It hurts worse than any and you're
fighting your need to urinate all bladder.

690
00:41:17,130 --> 00:41:22,130
But every ounce to comes out you are
ready to fall on the floor screaming.

691
00:41:22,470 --> 00:41:24,450
Wow. Yeah, it's nice.

692
00:41:24,540 --> 00:41:29,370
And then one shot in the ass did dawn
is the syphilis outbreak in porn.

693
00:41:29,930 --> 00:41:30,630
Really?

694
00:41:30,630 --> 00:41:35,630
Some dude got syphilis and then
like didn't show his full medicals,

695
00:41:36,171 --> 00:41:38,480
didn't show,
he fakes the shot.

696
00:41:38,780 --> 00:41:42,470
He took a shot and he thought he
was clean 10 days. That's his story.

697
00:41:43,460 --> 00:41:45,560
And apparently 11 days.
He didn't even,

698
00:41:45,561 --> 00:41:50,561
we waited one day and then the next day
he did a movie and gave people syphilis

699
00:41:52,430 --> 00:41:56,210
cause it's dominoes. She then have
sex before. I mean he didn't even,

700
00:41:56,230 --> 00:41:58,280
I mean you didn't even get another check.

701
00:41:58,310 --> 00:42:01,280
It didn't even get another blood test
to see if it's still in the system.

702
00:42:01,970 --> 00:42:05,100
He didn't even, he just said I got to
work. Well because you don't have to it.

703
00:42:05,120 --> 00:42:07,740
My friend is the head of the uh,
the um,

704
00:42:08,730 --> 00:42:12,090
a venereal disease department of
the Health Service for California.

705
00:42:12,460 --> 00:42:13,890
His whole thing is trying to get,

706
00:42:15,240 --> 00:42:18,690
I mean he knows as much about porn is
I do because that's his whole thing is

707
00:42:18,691 --> 00:42:21,030
like, you know, when they
started using condoms,

708
00:42:21,031 --> 00:42:25,320
that was him and he said that the testing,
once a month you get tested,

709
00:42:25,321 --> 00:42:30,150
which means that gestation period
for HIV is like 20 days or whatever.

710
00:42:30,230 --> 00:42:32,040
Right.
So you're never really catching it.

711
00:42:32,250 --> 00:42:36,540
And that there's one agency that does
the testing for all the porn movies and

712
00:42:36,541 --> 00:42:41,520
it's not even a medical office. It's
not, it's not a doctor. The clinic. Yeah.

713
00:42:41,590 --> 00:42:44,650
But they closed all these
play places down there.

714
00:42:44,740 --> 00:42:48,390
They're all forced to go to one place
now where it used to be really convenient

715
00:42:48,391 --> 00:42:51,840
that like you should be able to
go to any doctor, get a test,

716
00:42:51,870 --> 00:42:55,830
get all the tasks because it's all the
blood sent to the same places as these

717
00:42:55,831 --> 00:42:58,200
labs, but they're not
letting them do that anymore.

718
00:42:58,201 --> 00:43:01,080
So now they're all forced to go
to this one sketchy plays and,

719
00:43:01,150 --> 00:43:03,440
and so there's all these
creepy people at hangout. They,

720
00:43:03,441 --> 00:43:06,180
you're trying to fuck with them and
stuff like that. And it's, yeah,

721
00:43:06,181 --> 00:43:10,560
and it's also they have to pay for it.
The actors pay for the test themselves.

722
00:43:10,980 --> 00:43:15,000
What fucking job that you go to that
right? I mean, first of all, it's a law.

723
00:43:15,030 --> 00:43:17,220
You have to give tests it to work.
If it's a law,

724
00:43:17,250 --> 00:43:19,050
why the fuck are they paying for it?

725
00:43:19,520 --> 00:43:24,290
Yeah. That is a business that didn't
get a bailout, that business crumbled.

726
00:43:24,950 --> 00:43:26,390
I mean there's God's still making money.

727
00:43:26,391 --> 00:43:28,220
There's like the very
clever computer guys.

728
00:43:28,940 --> 00:43:33,940
But you think about like the business
of pornography and how many people watch

729
00:43:34,101 --> 00:43:34,934
pornography.

730
00:43:35,090 --> 00:43:38,030
And then the fact that all of a sudden
no one was paying for it anymore,

731
00:43:38,120 --> 00:43:42,020
like all of a sudden it all just went
away and it's gotten bigger and porn is

732
00:43:42,021 --> 00:43:46,150
everywhere. Yeah, it's everywhere in the
Mitt. Romney gets an off. What do you say?

733
00:43:46,160 --> 00:43:50,810
Number one profit tier from pornography?
Yes. Who It is? Mitt Romney?

734
00:43:50,900 --> 00:43:55,760
Nope. Close. It's another Mormon.
Really? Oh, the Marriott family.

735
00:43:56,210 --> 00:44:01,210
They own more hotel chains that sell
porn and that's the only place people are

736
00:44:01,281 --> 00:44:04,430
paying for anyway. They're the number
one profit or from pornography.

737
00:44:04,700 --> 00:44:08,210
Squeaky clean Mormon people do
pay for it still. Allegedly.

738
00:44:09,200 --> 00:44:12,540
I should say that so I don't get that.
They're squeaky clean. No, no. They fit.

739
00:44:12,550 --> 00:44:17,000
They're the number one. I think they may
well if they're not number one there,

740
00:44:17,030 --> 00:44:20,420
they made a fuck load of, I would
say motel six with me. Number one.

741
00:44:20,560 --> 00:44:21,393
I think they own it.

742
00:44:21,560 --> 00:44:25,700
I think Marriott owns a lot of this
chain auger still sturdy pornographers to

743
00:44:25,701 --> 00:44:28,910
Marriott's. Isn't that crazy?
When was she found out?

744
00:44:28,911 --> 00:44:33,060
They made like millions a year from
pornography as businessmen in the road

745
00:44:33,270 --> 00:44:36,990
weeping at the end of the bed.
Lisa,

746
00:44:37,320 --> 00:44:40,320
the expense account, I don't have
to, that's why they do it so much.

747
00:44:40,321 --> 00:44:44,700
It's all in the expensive. They don't
question you for those $40 movies.

748
00:44:44,790 --> 00:44:47,520
Hey don't mark them anymore.
They don't mark anything.

749
00:44:47,550 --> 00:44:50,700
They don't give you a title on
the bill. Just moving horse. Yeah.

750
00:44:50,701 --> 00:44:54,300
They can't give you a title in the bill
that they had to know a long time ago.

751
00:44:54,301 --> 00:44:58,050
That was a must. When you block porn,
cause I'm assuming you don't anymore.

752
00:44:58,290 --> 00:45:02,760
What was your thing? What section? Real
and shopping. I didn't ever have a thing.

753
00:45:04,410 --> 00:45:08,610
Never really got like too specific.
It's uh,

754
00:45:08,910 --> 00:45:11,430
you know the thing about porn
is this different, you know,

755
00:45:11,431 --> 00:45:14,910
you want to see different
people, you know, you know,

756
00:45:14,940 --> 00:45:17,670
even if one girl is really pretty,
you get bored.

757
00:45:17,980 --> 00:45:21,460
I got, I started off girl girl only.
Like I didn't even want any grades.

758
00:45:21,640 --> 00:45:22,840
Picture Brian's like,

759
00:45:22,841 --> 00:45:26,410
let me just pretend that we're all on a
slumber party and I'm going to be your

760
00:45:26,411 --> 00:45:28,780
best B f f ever.

761
00:45:28,960 --> 00:45:32,710
Well, it's just something I didn't
see every day. Like I have had sex,

762
00:45:32,711 --> 00:45:36,660
but like I never saw two girls together.
Right. Shit was like aliens to me. Yeah.

763
00:45:36,670 --> 00:45:37,780
It's,
it's strange.

764
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:39,500
Yeah.

765
00:45:39,500 --> 00:45:41,870
Um, but they look happy. Usually.

766
00:45:42,320 --> 00:45:45,550
I just like to see a dream crushed
and Mike Clip, I need a dream crusher.

767
00:45:45,770 --> 00:45:50,420
A casting couch or oh, those are
the best. Those are hilarious.

768
00:45:50,421 --> 00:45:51,260
Or the,

769
00:45:51,320 --> 00:45:56,320
the was it was it bang bus that used to
have you guys pull over and people would

770
00:45:56,571 --> 00:45:59,630
just fuck get it in the car.
We got a porno star. Holy Shit.

771
00:45:59,960 --> 00:46:01,730
Now my favorite,
now it's fucking machine.

772
00:46:02,290 --> 00:46:05,900
Wasn't that kid the kid that was in
some, what was it? What movie was that?

773
00:46:07,080 --> 00:46:07,460
Okay.

774
00:46:07,460 --> 00:46:10,550
The kid that had done a porn when he
was young, he did like a bang brothers.

775
00:46:11,450 --> 00:46:16,290
Oh, Jonathan. Yes. Yeah.
From project tax. Yeah. Yeah.

776
00:46:16,360 --> 00:46:21,070
What was his story again? Uh, he just,
he did a, uh, I think it was a bang bus.

777
00:46:21,130 --> 00:46:25,000
How old was he? I think he'd be just
turned 18 or something like that.

778
00:46:25,360 --> 00:46:28,150
He's a John. Johnathan came and think
it was written it last name right now,

779
00:46:28,151 --> 00:46:30,760
but he was in that movie project
acts and he's like a big Chubby,

780
00:46:30,761 --> 00:46:35,761
nerdy kid with glasses and he
was in a movie where he fucked,

781
00:46:36,581 --> 00:46:40,900
I think it was his first time too,
like four girls in a bus.

782
00:46:41,260 --> 00:46:46,120
And He, the funny part was though
is that it really for girls,

783
00:46:46,150 --> 00:46:50,590
I think it was and the funny thing
was is that he had like a huge hog.

784
00:46:50,591 --> 00:46:54,640
So it's just like, it was like so weird
that like I actually knew him before,

785
00:46:54,670 --> 00:46:57,160
like, like we had them on,
I had him on a few podcasts,

786
00:46:57,161 --> 00:46:59,110
like I didn't know about it and such.

787
00:46:59,111 --> 00:47:02,390
I think knowing a guy and then finding
out you this in porn and then seeing is

788
00:47:02,650 --> 00:47:07,060
he his hog that happened with me with
a, you know, seven racks from MTV.

789
00:47:08,380 --> 00:47:12,850
He was like one of the original VJ then.
Yeah, it doesn't, he has another name now.

790
00:47:13,360 --> 00:47:18,040
He has a band now. Yeah, exactly. And
He's good. He's fucking good. Yeah. Good.

791
00:47:18,041 --> 00:47:21,280
But on my podcast, is
that what, what song?

792
00:47:21,970 --> 00:47:23,650
the 80s is that what it is?

793
00:47:24,040 --> 00:47:28,480
And I can't remember about the eighties
fuck no, I'm going to go crazy.

794
00:47:28,690 --> 00:47:30,010
We'll drop into the podcast

795
00:47:30,010 --> 00:47:33,460
later. But um, yeah, but he did
some kind of, he just masturbating.

796
00:47:33,490 --> 00:47:36,100
But I think it was a big hit with the,
with the men gentlemen

797
00:47:37,450 --> 00:47:39,560
came out like after he was famous.
No,

798
00:47:39,561 --> 00:47:42,460
I'm going crazy trying to remember
this fucking song. You so crazy.

799
00:47:43,030 --> 00:47:45,280
Shut the fuck up.
What's wrong with you today?

800
00:47:45,460 --> 00:47:49,360
You've got to stop doing ecstasy
so much. Breaking your brain, man.

801
00:47:50,140 --> 00:47:52,410
Holy Brain. What's the
fuck machine? Cheesy

802
00:47:52,520 --> 00:47:56,420
brain fog machine is a, it's the called
the fucking machines.com I think it is.

803
00:47:56,421 --> 00:48:00,980
And it's actually robots that Oh
fuck. Really high powered. Like,

804
00:48:01,160 --> 00:48:03,620
like you know like Oh cool.

805
00:48:04,550 --> 00:48:08,470
Shoot in and out of them like 80 miles
per hour and they can't control it.

806
00:48:08,471 --> 00:48:11,210
Like they're tied down. So like there's
somebody sitting there going, yeah,

807
00:48:11,211 --> 00:48:14,840
I'm going to fuck you hard. And
like, it's really crazy. Like Dana,

808
00:48:14,841 --> 00:48:17,180
dear mom did it and it seems like

809
00:48:17,460 --> 00:48:21,300
break your pussy. Yeah, that's a good
way to get your pussy all broken.

810
00:48:22,100 --> 00:48:25,890
So machine robot metal deck,
but just fucking stabbing,

811
00:48:25,891 --> 00:48:30,620
you know. Well what if, what if it goes a
little too hard? I know. Let's run with it

812
00:48:30,900 --> 00:48:34,890
or where you hold the other end. Is it
that much of a Chore Machine? Fuck you.

813
00:48:34,891 --> 00:48:36,780
You gotta be real careful
about that kind of shit. Shit.

814
00:48:36,781 --> 00:48:40,170
And what's crazy is that that people
on those web cam sites are now doing it

815
00:48:40,171 --> 00:48:43,380
because they have like these, I guess
you can easily buy him now for your home.

816
00:48:43,470 --> 00:48:45,030
Like,
like a portable one that's just like,

817
00:48:45,060 --> 00:48:47,370
or they may come from
like a hardware store,

818
00:48:47,730 --> 00:48:50,610
but like there's this one girl that
she's just so it's like getting up,

819
00:48:50,790 --> 00:48:53,670
like the Dodo is like,
I don't know,

820
00:48:54,150 --> 00:48:56,850
12 inches maybe like a huge dildo.

821
00:48:57,180 --> 00:48:59,430
And she was giving a blowjob to it,

822
00:48:59,780 --> 00:49:04,500
put it on full blast or you can just
see it like her, her throat get bigger,

823
00:49:04,501 --> 00:49:07,730
like a snake eating a watermelon and it,
and it's,

824
00:49:07,890 --> 00:49:11,520
it was like you're gonna hurt yourself.
You're going to break something,

825
00:49:11,550 --> 00:49:15,870
you're going to choke and or you're
going to crack your neck open. So crazy.

826
00:49:15,940 --> 00:49:17,320
And what's weird is that

827
00:49:17,460 --> 00:49:21,510
what is like the, with the
algorithm in your brain that wants,

828
00:49:22,140 --> 00:49:25,350
like when you talk about different,
like I used to love Asian chicks,

829
00:49:25,800 --> 00:49:28,450
got another feet. I was never like, I'd
let me suck your feet and your call,

830
00:49:28,460 --> 00:49:31,650
but I appreciate a nice pair of feet,
especially on an Asian woman.

831
00:49:31,920 --> 00:49:34,080
Let's just put that out there.
So then,

832
00:49:34,500 --> 00:49:37,620
then I move on to the cast and catch
and I start to wonder on a deeper level,

833
00:49:37,621 --> 00:49:42,621
what is it about my personality or my
brainwaves that attracts me to a specific

834
00:49:44,371 --> 00:49:44,791
thing.

835
00:49:44,791 --> 00:49:49,410
And then what is it that has so broken
down the social order that people respond

836
00:49:49,411 --> 00:49:52,410
to machines. Fucking, it's
like the flesh, the softness,

837
00:49:52,411 --> 00:49:57,030
the humanity has been stripped away and
all that's left is the violent part of

838
00:49:57,031 --> 00:49:57,864
fucking

839
00:49:58,260 --> 00:50:02,350
do. Have you heard of this new,
um, this discovery at Harvard,

840
00:50:02,351 --> 00:50:07,150
they've created a cyborg flesh of course
at Harvard because nobody can get later,

841
00:50:07,390 --> 00:50:09,520
right? Yeah, exactly. I mean,

842
00:50:09,670 --> 00:50:14,670
but along those lines like this is
like literally step one until you,

843
00:50:15,160 --> 00:50:19,000
you create a robot that's going
to fuck you up. Amit. Robot.

844
00:50:20,290 --> 00:50:23,890
This is nuts, man. Fuck the flying
jet. This is pretty intense shit.

845
00:50:24,250 --> 00:50:25,770
It's to create the Cyborg flesh.

846
00:50:25,771 --> 00:50:28,040
You start with a three dimensional
scaffold that encourages

847
00:50:28,040 --> 00:50:32,150
cells to grow around them. These
scaffolds are generally made of Collagen,

848
00:50:32,151 --> 00:50:34,490
which makes up the connective
tissue and almost every animal.

849
00:50:35,090 --> 00:50:39,770
The Harvard engineer's basically took
normal collagen and wove nano wires and

850
00:50:39,771 --> 00:50:44,771
transistors into the matrix to
create a nano electric scaffold.

851
00:50:48,860 --> 00:50:50,210
The neurons,
heart cells,

852
00:50:50,211 --> 00:50:53,900
muscles and blood vessels
within grown as normal,

853
00:50:53,990 --> 00:50:58,520
creating cyborg tissue with
a built in sensor network.

854
00:50:58,820 --> 00:51:02,750
Is this the plot of a porn movie or
this is reality. This is reality, man.

855
00:51:02,751 --> 00:51:04,880
This is crazy shit.

856
00:51:05,180 --> 00:51:08,000
This is like Cyborg flesh.

857
00:51:08,510 --> 00:51:13,010
Like they're figuring out a way to
replace your skin with robot skin.

858
00:51:13,370 --> 00:51:18,370
I'm going to see you in 20 years from
now and you're going to be a 24 year old,

859
00:51:18,590 --> 00:51:20,420
handsome man,
Asian.

860
00:51:20,450 --> 00:51:25,450
They're going to take your whole body
and slowly replace your skin with some

861
00:51:26,031 --> 00:51:28,610
fucking robots. Can. I'm going to
have to get used to young Greg.

862
00:51:28,640 --> 00:51:31,340
It's going to be weird. What about
the hair? Talk to me about the air.

863
00:51:31,341 --> 00:51:33,550
Get your fuck.
Even if I could grow my hair,

864
00:51:33,560 --> 00:51:37,580
I'd go back to shaving it and it was
freeing feeling. Just rub it through.

865
00:51:38,600 --> 00:51:41,700
But it will stop you from getting
a certain type of exam. Hard life.

866
00:51:41,860 --> 00:51:45,950
They're there. They've created
and court officials. No, no, no.

867
00:51:46,040 --> 00:51:50,690
I'm saying this is step one to be a
robot. You know, that is your sex slave.

868
00:51:50,770 --> 00:51:53,560
Well, that's why, you know, it's
all male scientists and the women,

869
00:51:53,680 --> 00:51:58,510
they're like Israel trying to fucking
defunk uh, Iran's nuclear program.

870
00:51:59,020 --> 00:52:03,010
They're coming in at night
exposing all this tests. Totally,

871
00:52:03,730 --> 00:52:07,480
totally, totally throwing,
fucking painted them and shit.

872
00:52:08,380 --> 00:52:11,170
You're never going to get their fake pussy

873
00:52:13,260 --> 00:52:16,450
fucking white laboratory
on fire while they sleep.

874
00:52:18,190 --> 00:52:19,480
Yet he finally think they've got,

875
00:52:19,481 --> 00:52:22,060
when she comes out and they
design it like a garbage,

876
00:52:22,061 --> 00:52:24,940
it's spells of the pussy just
fucking devours that little Dick,

877
00:52:25,360 --> 00:52:26,500
that little Harvard Dick.

878
00:52:30,100 --> 00:52:34,010
You're so funny though. Sexual Boston
to you say that little Harvard tick.

879
00:52:36,450 --> 00:52:37,283
Okay.

880
00:52:37,440 --> 00:52:39,280
You're getting, you're fucking, you're at,

881
00:52:39,290 --> 00:52:42,710
you're at your graduation with the
count on trying to hide the stump.

882
00:52:42,830 --> 00:52:45,830
This, this, this thing
is really complicated.

883
00:52:46,010 --> 00:52:48,560
I don't think I even
understood what I just said,

884
00:52:48,950 --> 00:52:52,610
but what would it seems
to me is that this is,

885
00:52:52,910 --> 00:52:55,610
I mean they're going to be,
they can create flesh.

886
00:52:55,670 --> 00:52:57,200
They've already figured out
how to do that. They can,

887
00:52:57,650 --> 00:53:01,400
they figured out a way to create meat
in like essentially like a test tube

888
00:53:01,401 --> 00:53:03,500
environment they've had,
you know,

889
00:53:04,070 --> 00:53:08,900
so it's just a matter of time before
and the meat is replicated DNA.

890
00:53:08,901 --> 00:53:12,650
Is it? Is it green? Understand it. I'm
too stupid to answer that question.

891
00:53:12,651 --> 00:53:14,390
I guess the big,

892
00:53:14,391 --> 00:53:18,440
the big turn is getting it to actually
reproduce itself DNA like it does in

893
00:53:18,441 --> 00:53:19,700
humans.
Exactly.

894
00:53:19,730 --> 00:53:23,930
But it seems to me that if they
could replicate one aspect of it,

895
00:53:23,931 --> 00:53:27,390
if they could figure out how to meat,
it's just a matter of time.

896
00:53:27,391 --> 00:53:32,040
It's like we went from the model t
Ford to the, you know, 2013 corvette.

897
00:53:32,070 --> 00:53:35,550
It's like it gets better. It gets
better, it gets better, it gets better.

898
00:53:35,551 --> 00:53:38,760
It's when they're doing this now,
this is what they're doing now.

899
00:53:38,940 --> 00:53:43,940
This is going to expand into
something else incredibly freaky.

900
00:53:44,400 --> 00:53:48,480
This is going to be incredibly,
incredibly freaky. This is cyborg tissue.

901
00:53:49,090 --> 00:53:52,740
I mean this is, you can
make a fucking cylon. Okay.

902
00:53:52,800 --> 00:53:57,420
You could make a Cyborg like this is
step one. When they look back in history,

903
00:53:57,600 --> 00:54:01,800
when life is like Battlestar Galactica
fucking for real and we really are

904
00:54:01,801 --> 00:54:04,200
fighting off these intelligent
robots that we created.

905
00:54:04,380 --> 00:54:08,730
This will be the day where people
look at this and go, wait, what did,

906
00:54:08,750 --> 00:54:12,660
what did they do? What did they make?
What did they started with this?

907
00:54:12,661 --> 00:54:16,140
And then goes from this to what?
And by the time they tell you about this,

908
00:54:16,350 --> 00:54:19,760
how far are they along on this? There'll
be the ones telling you about it. Yeah.

909
00:54:20,520 --> 00:54:23,550
Clones. Clones will be
telling you about cloning. We,

910
00:54:23,551 --> 00:54:27,180
well we figured out how to clone this
just cause it guy is clone who's telling

911
00:54:27,181 --> 00:54:27,850
you about it.

912
00:54:27,850 --> 00:54:30,430
Yeah. And, and the amazing
thing is that you look at,

913
00:54:30,431 --> 00:54:34,600
like I went to the Santa Monica promenade
the other day and they come out of the

914
00:54:34,780 --> 00:54:39,490
five story parking garage with a line
of cars at two different stations.

915
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:45,000
No human being like you're literally
collecting between five and $10 every 15

916
00:54:45,611 --> 00:54:47,380
seconds all day and night.

917
00:54:47,590 --> 00:54:52,060
You can't pay 12 bucks an hour to
some fucking guy to have a job.

918
00:54:52,240 --> 00:54:55,850
And that's what's happened is that they
talk about unemployment is his dad.

919
00:54:55,880 --> 00:54:58,450
You know, the unemployment
rate is high. Well,

920
00:54:58,451 --> 00:55:01,510
it's not just high because
the economy's not doing good.

921
00:55:01,600 --> 00:55:05,590
It's they're slicing jobs with
machines everywhere. Just to stay at.

922
00:55:05,620 --> 00:55:07,060
Even with the job rate,

923
00:55:07,180 --> 00:55:11,390
you would have to be creating x number
of jobs every month and with these

924
00:55:11,391 --> 00:55:15,280
cyborgs, what the fuck? Who's,
who's going to have a job anymore?

925
00:55:16,190 --> 00:55:19,010
Yeah. Who's going to have any
sort of a manual labor job?

926
00:55:19,040 --> 00:55:20,720
I welcome the side work friends.

927
00:55:22,060 --> 00:55:27,060
I think I rather enjoy paying a machine
and talking to the Hershey garage.

928
00:55:27,910 --> 00:55:32,090
The idea, I think it's faster too.
So it's, it's more convenient.

929
00:55:32,091 --> 00:55:36,950
It's faster. So there's a crop. We are
so crazy because here's the problem.

930
00:55:37,120 --> 00:55:39,440
They are going to be intelligent.
If they're going to be intelligence,

931
00:55:39,441 --> 00:55:41,120
they're going to be able to be sentience,

932
00:55:41,150 --> 00:55:43,110
which means they're going
to have their own will.

933
00:55:43,111 --> 00:55:44,660
They can do whatever
they would like to do.

934
00:55:45,020 --> 00:55:47,750
The first thing they're going to
do is make a better one of them.

935
00:55:48,230 --> 00:55:51,320
They're going to realize what we did
wrong. What was stupid about this?

936
00:55:51,321 --> 00:55:53,480
This is shitty. You thought
about this like a person would,

937
00:55:53,630 --> 00:55:57,140
let's Redo this better. And they'll
do that almost instantaneously.

938
00:55:57,380 --> 00:56:00,890
That's the big question in all of this,

939
00:56:00,891 --> 00:56:05,720
since the 1950s when they started talking
about robots and stuff is can there be

940
00:56:05,721 --> 00:56:06,554
a [inaudible],

941
00:56:06,690 --> 00:56:11,150
can there be that transition
from something that's been
programmed to something

942
00:56:11,151 --> 00:56:13,220
that can control itself?

943
00:56:13,260 --> 00:56:17,550
You know, it'd be really horrifying
if there never was a cent yet moment,

944
00:56:17,551 --> 00:56:22,551
but it acted as if there was one and it
just ran around like this meat puppet

945
00:56:23,980 --> 00:56:26,500
program.
Just fucking gun and holes and people.

946
00:56:26,530 --> 00:56:28,450
Yeah cause it didn't know
what it was supposed to do.

947
00:56:28,540 --> 00:56:33,070
Yeah. You can just throw him in a toilet,
pour some water on him, you know, stop.

948
00:56:33,540 --> 00:56:36,430
You know like that's like a cell phone.
Eight is electronics and my

949
00:56:36,740 --> 00:56:41,240
think twice probably have that covered.
That whole get wet part. It'll still,

950
00:56:42,290 --> 00:56:44,030
they already know how to
do that with cell phones.

951
00:56:44,031 --> 00:56:47,360
You know there's like some product
they dip it. No Shit. Yeah,

952
00:56:47,361 --> 00:56:50,270
they dip your cell phone in this product
and you can like literally drop in the

953
00:56:50,271 --> 00:56:53,770
ocean, pull it out, dry it off
and make this thing cell phone.

954
00:56:53,780 --> 00:56:56,960
You can bring it in and they do this.
Yeah. You send them the cell phone,

955
00:56:56,990 --> 00:57:01,100
they take it and soak it in some kind
of crazy polymer that doesn't have,

956
00:57:01,130 --> 00:57:02,810
I don't know the word polymer.

957
00:57:02,840 --> 00:57:05,540
I shouldn't be allowed to say it cause I
don't even know what the fuck a polymer

958
00:57:05,541 --> 00:57:10,520
is. Whatever. Plastic Shit.
How about that? Some awesome,
super cool plastic shit.

959
00:57:10,780 --> 00:57:15,620
[inaudible] water from getting through
to the electronics and somehow or another

960
00:57:15,621 --> 00:57:17,920
I don't understand it.
That's weird. Yeah, but the,

961
00:57:17,960 --> 00:57:20,570
there's demonstrations of it online.
I can't remember the name of it,

962
00:57:20,571 --> 00:57:25,040
but if you're so curious you will
Google it. You just hit your cock in it.

963
00:57:25,080 --> 00:57:28,220
Never wear a condom. Yeah. I don't
think you'd feel pee as much.

964
00:57:29,120 --> 00:57:32,570
Y'all black saying shit like every time
you're in the shower with your girl you

965
00:57:32,571 --> 00:57:36,080
got a boat or she's like, why is
it so? I see this is so weird.

966
00:57:36,081 --> 00:57:38,210
It's like you never just beating up on it

967
00:57:40,090 --> 00:57:41,840
like the hood of a fucking Chevy,

968
00:57:43,180 --> 00:57:45,620
like your deck on fire
and stick it in the cake,

969
00:57:48,020 --> 00:57:48,650
isn't it?

970
00:57:48,650 --> 00:57:53,650
Dan is one of the nicest qualities
about those old American muscle cars was

971
00:57:53,871 --> 00:57:55,820
those big long,
giant hoods.

972
00:57:55,821 --> 00:58:00,410
When you wax the car and then it rained
and the water beat it up on that thing

973
00:58:00,411 --> 00:58:04,190
and you just kind of swipe the
water off those fucking cars, man,

974
00:58:04,220 --> 00:58:05,090
those were works of

975
00:58:05,220 --> 00:58:09,390
art. I get to show you this Mustang
I saw today. I was over in Burbank

976
00:58:10,960 --> 00:58:15,870
before Burbank. Nupur everywhere.
Wherever CBS Radford is. That's Burbank,

977
00:58:16,290 --> 00:58:21,000
isn't it? Parking garage, studio city.
And uh, there was this, don't be a hater.

978
00:58:21,060 --> 00:58:25,360
Don't be starting gang
violence. Check this out. Feel

979
00:58:26,940 --> 00:58:31,560
some kind of special cat. It
said like California. What is it?

980
00:58:32,310 --> 00:58:33,450
California additional what?

981
00:58:34,380 --> 00:58:39,380
What he's showing me
look like a 68 Mustang.

982
00:58:40,200 --> 00:58:44,480
But it had these, uh, maybe you'll
recognize it. I'd never seen him.

983
00:58:44,490 --> 00:58:47,610
It's hilarious to me how a guy like you,

984
00:58:47,880 --> 00:58:50,860
it doesn't have some fucking
crazy car like this. It's Todd.

985
00:58:50,920 --> 00:58:55,440
You're already convinced me head
writer job on it. What's that?

986
00:58:55,530 --> 00:58:57,960
I said this is an old one
that looks like a 67 maybe.

987
00:58:57,990 --> 00:59:00,690
I don't know that it's got
scopes on the side by the doors.

988
00:59:00,691 --> 00:59:04,050
The lines of those cars were just so
beautiful and it was a three 50 like

989
00:59:04,051 --> 00:59:08,130
special edition. It sat on the side.
But no, I'm up for a head writer job.

990
00:59:08,131 --> 00:59:10,050
It's why I was just over there.
And if I get it,

991
00:59:10,380 --> 00:59:13,680
I'm pulling the trigger cause I'll be
commuting to fucking CBS Radford from

992
00:59:13,681 --> 00:59:17,940
Venice. I think I'm gonna
get the challenger to get by.

993
00:59:18,060 --> 00:59:22,100
It's a lot of gas, gas,
but feel like a fucking

994
00:59:22,100 --> 00:59:25,040
man when you get in there.
The rumble of the engine.

995
00:59:27,320 --> 00:59:30,380
I rented a Mustang in Ohio, my wife
in the back and not like, yeah,

996
00:59:30,920 --> 00:59:34,340
he rented a Mustang and didn't like
2012 convertible Mustang. It was just,

997
00:59:35,470 --> 00:59:37,550
you were just telling me about.
I have one, I love it. Yeah.

998
00:59:37,551 --> 00:59:39,470
But here's a different style.
I think.

999
00:59:39,600 --> 00:59:42,680
Well I have the, the, it's a different,
what's different experiences?

1000
00:59:42,690 --> 00:59:45,390
The GT 500 it's 550 horsepower.

1001
00:59:45,510 --> 00:59:50,130
So aluminum block engine and the Ford
gt engine put into this wobbly as

1002
00:59:50,131 --> 00:59:53,010
convertible body. It's
beautiful. It's so much fun.

1003
00:59:53,011 --> 00:59:57,300
It's the most American Dick
hard car I've ever driven. Okay.

1004
00:59:57,420 --> 00:59:59,610
I wouldn't want to drink black.
I wouldn't want to drive it every day,

1005
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:02,430
but when I drive it, it's
fun. It's fuck, it's just,

1006
01:00:02,431 --> 01:00:06,450
I don't even think about playing anything
except seventies rock in that car

1007
01:00:06,930 --> 01:00:10,770
because it's just got that as a rumble.
The VI Lenon scanned it all the way.

1008
01:00:10,771 --> 01:00:14,130
I got it on a big Leonard Skinner kick
when I bought this car cause I'm like,

1009
01:00:14,131 --> 01:00:16,170
this is the kind of music
you need to be listening to.

1010
01:00:16,750 --> 01:00:21,750
Simple man is perhaps the most moving
rock song father telling his son

1011
01:00:23,210 --> 01:00:28,210
how to be a man's fucking great on the
battle of the ballot of Curtis Lowe.

1012
01:00:29,390 --> 01:00:33,710
Yeah. Yeah. They had, they had some
classic shit, so fucking underrated.

1013
01:00:33,711 --> 01:00:38,090
But there's something about dudes that
guys can, for whatever stupid reason,

1014
01:00:38,240 --> 01:00:43,240
like really viscerally connect with the
sound of an engine of a car and you know

1015
01:00:43,911 --> 01:00:45,890
that kind of like,
you know,

1016
01:00:46,310 --> 01:00:50,150
1970s in 19 late 1960s classic rock,

1017
01:00:50,750 --> 01:00:55,750
they ball together into one really like
guy centric experience and I dunno what

1018
01:00:57,711 --> 01:00:59,300
the fuck it is.
It's really weird.

1019
01:00:59,301 --> 01:01:03,230
Like I've tried to assess my love
for the rumble of an engine before,

1020
01:01:03,231 --> 01:01:06,680
like why it's so retarded with me.
Like I get it like a shriek,

1021
01:01:06,681 --> 01:01:10,820
like a little child when I hear a good
engine whale. Like I just fucking love it.

1022
01:01:10,821 --> 01:01:14,570
It just sounds awesome, but
it's stupid. It's so stupid.

1023
01:01:14,571 --> 01:01:16,580
Like wouldn't it be better
if it was completely silent?

1024
01:01:16,850 --> 01:01:19,650
Like that's what I don't like about
the Prius that it's totally side.

1025
01:01:19,790 --> 01:01:22,520
But wouldn't that be awesome?
You know,

1026
01:01:22,521 --> 01:01:26,660
it was for one thing and this fucking
stupid life to not just make a shit load

1027
01:01:26,661 --> 01:01:28,700
of noise everywhere it goes.
Wouldn't that be awesome?

1028
01:01:28,770 --> 01:01:31,840
You know what, give me a Prius
that has a fake sound when I the,

1029
01:01:32,430 --> 01:01:34,120
it just plays on the inside of the car.

1030
01:01:34,460 --> 01:01:37,340
Well do you know the, they
have a BMW that does that. It,

1031
01:01:37,650 --> 01:01:42,650
the BMW m five has the sound of the
engine transmitted through the speakers.

1032
01:01:43,190 --> 01:01:45,440
It's really kind of a
cheesy move but it's,

1033
01:01:45,950 --> 01:01:49,520
and it's an automatic double clutch.
It's an automatic,

1034
01:01:49,521 --> 01:01:52,400
but the best way to drive
it is to use the paddles.

1035
01:01:52,490 --> 01:01:55,730
You know like when they like tracking down
the track. It's a, it's an amazing car.

1036
01:01:55,920 --> 01:01:58,190
I mean it's not,
there's nothing bad about the car,

1037
01:01:58,400 --> 01:02:01,670
it's just the decision to like make
the sound come through the stereo.

1038
01:02:01,671 --> 01:02:02,570
It seems like cheating.

1039
01:02:02,590 --> 01:02:05,760
Like it sounds like what it sounds
like they had to make it a, a,

1040
01:02:05,761 --> 01:02:07,910
a turbo because um,

1041
01:02:07,940 --> 01:02:12,200
there's all these new crazy gas efficiency
laws that are coming out and it's

1042
01:02:12,201 --> 01:02:16,610
really hard to make a the same
like gas guzzler type engines.

1043
01:02:16,940 --> 01:02:20,910
By the time I think it's 2016

1044
01:02:21,180 --> 01:02:25,910
I believe it is, every car is going
to have to be above 35 miles account.

1045
01:02:26,090 --> 01:02:29,070
That's going to be the industry standard.
So like all these cars,

1046
01:02:29,071 --> 01:02:30,390
like these mustangs and shit,

1047
01:02:30,391 --> 01:02:32,990
you won't be able to buy them
just in a few years from now.

1048
01:02:34,020 --> 01:02:37,410
You can't get anything retarded in
a few years. Yeah. Because like it,

1049
01:02:37,420 --> 01:02:41,130
and by the way, the, the, the Shelby,
the Gt 500, somehow or another,

1050
01:02:41,131 --> 01:02:43,890
it doesn't even get a gas
guzzler tax, you know, I don't,

1051
01:02:43,891 --> 01:02:47,850
I don't know how that is huge.
It's a huge VA,

1052
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:50,960
but they figured out something,
make it really efficient. Yeah.

1053
01:02:51,700 --> 01:02:52,900
You were saying that,
what was the,

1054
01:02:52,960 --> 01:02:56,260
the car you can bring on a track
that got better mileage than a Prius,

1055
01:02:56,560 --> 01:03:01,250
uh, be a BMW m three. Yeah. When you
bring a Prius on to attract top gear,

1056
01:03:01,251 --> 01:03:02,390
did this,
they,

1057
01:03:02,770 --> 01:03:06,550
they took a Prius and they made it go
full blast around a race track and all the

1058
01:03:06,551 --> 01:03:11,551
BMW had to do was keep up with it and
the BMW kept up with it easily and got

1059
01:03:11,651 --> 01:03:13,510
better gas mileage than the Prius did.
Hmm.

1060
01:03:13,540 --> 01:03:17,620
Because the Prius was fighting for its
fucking life or as the BMW was just like

1061
01:03:17,650 --> 01:03:18,483
sprinting.

1062
01:03:18,750 --> 01:03:21,660
Well. Yeah, but I think the Prius
is designed to save you money.

1063
01:03:21,661 --> 01:03:24,600
Stop and go through town.
It's not not, not for highway.

1064
01:03:24,810 --> 01:03:28,560
Yeah. That's the whole point of the brakes
generating extra power, right? Yeah.

1065
01:03:28,561 --> 01:03:29,490
The breaks help

1066
01:03:29,850 --> 01:03:32,520
and it's got it down to,
mine's got to down shift thing now,

1067
01:03:32,521 --> 01:03:34,290
so you actually collect even more it,

1068
01:03:34,291 --> 01:03:38,370
it'll decelerate the way
if you downshifted wood and
collect that energy when

1069
01:03:38,371 --> 01:03:40,770
you're going to pull the trigger.
As soon as I get this job,

1070
01:03:41,220 --> 01:03:43,110
I'm going to find out in the next week.
Okay.

1071
01:03:43,440 --> 01:03:45,630
Women will never understand
these conversations,

1072
01:03:45,810 --> 01:03:48,180
but we'll never understand
fucking handbags.

1073
01:03:48,181 --> 01:03:50,730
Do you ever get a handbag
conversation with Mrs Fitzsimmons?

1074
01:03:51,540 --> 01:03:53,260
Not like that at all.
Oh God.

1075
01:03:54,440 --> 01:03:59,240
We just went to a big wedding and
she borrowed handbags. Jewelry.

1076
01:03:59,241 --> 01:04:04,220
I felt like such a dude
dress. I'm like, book go shit.

1077
01:04:04,221 --> 01:04:09,221
She shopped for two fucking
weeks and didn't find anything.

1078
01:04:09,350 --> 01:04:13,280
I go into a store and it's very simple.
I need a shirt.

1079
01:04:13,460 --> 01:04:17,300
I'm going to this store. I'm walking
out with his shirt. That's all it takes.

1080
01:04:17,330 --> 01:04:21,440
Pants, this store walk, Christmas
shopping, got to buy some for the wife,

1081
01:04:21,470 --> 01:04:23,330
this store coming out with something.

1082
01:04:23,840 --> 01:04:26,460
She spent two weeks going in
and out and did not find any.

1083
01:04:26,600 --> 01:04:29,810
That boggles my fucking mind.
She had the best affairs ever.

1084
01:04:31,460 --> 01:04:35,390
No one has got no class. It's keeps
on leaving. I know all these guys.

1085
01:04:36,390 --> 01:04:37,610
Warmth,
warmth,

1086
01:04:39,430 --> 01:04:41,910
the way your wife shooting.

1087
01:04:42,410 --> 01:04:46,800
She found a friend that had addressed
though that. Yup. That's weird.

1088
01:04:46,801 --> 01:04:50,330
That's hilarious. So what does your wife
usually wear? Like lumberjack shit. Like,

1089
01:04:50,630 --> 01:04:51,021
yeah,

1090
01:04:51,021 --> 01:04:56,021
she's into flannel Timberland's
she's got a hay hay in her hair now.

1091
01:04:56,901 --> 01:04:57,230
She does.

1092
01:04:57,230 --> 01:05:02,230
She works like she's got big tits so
she'll wear 34 days and tight jeans.

1093
01:05:05,110 --> 01:05:08,540
Not Tight, tight, but you know, she's got
a good fucking body man. I swear to God.

1094
01:05:08,780 --> 01:05:12,380
I had sex with her the other day and
I was just like, fuck God damn it.

1095
01:05:12,381 --> 01:05:17,320
Your body's nice. You know, I check
her out all the times. And uh,

1096
01:05:17,350 --> 01:05:20,840
she, she initiated, it was fucking
night milky. She initiated,

1097
01:05:20,860 --> 01:05:24,010
he's given us full details.
I mean in, you know,

1098
01:05:24,220 --> 01:05:28,500
in the living room and walked
in. Music wanted it. Okay.

1099
01:05:28,940 --> 01:05:31,650
And the music player now what was on TV?

1100
01:05:31,651 --> 01:05:33,910
I was like something like
seeing how it was on my laptop,

1101
01:05:33,911 --> 01:05:36,520
on the chair in the living
room and she fucking lap dance.

1102
01:05:36,521 --> 01:05:40,600
We would know music and then we
threw down on the couch and uh,

1103
01:05:41,080 --> 01:05:46,010
and then she just walked away, kept
on doing her shit. It's Tuck it.

1104
01:05:46,160 --> 01:05:50,170
Would it be funny if Greg and his wife
didn't really have sex at all anymore but

1105
01:05:50,171 --> 01:05:50,681
he liked,

1106
01:05:50,681 --> 01:05:55,510
could written all these stories but it
gets a crossed up and he doesn't realize

1107
01:05:55,660 --> 01:05:57,010
he told us this one already,

1108
01:05:57,011 --> 01:05:59,500
but it was a little different
before it was on the couch.

1109
01:06:01,300 --> 01:06:03,340
He said the same thing
about her walking away.

1110
01:06:04,550 --> 01:06:07,040
You imagine catching
someone in a crazy lie,

1111
01:06:07,400 --> 01:06:12,160
the best marriage ever and just find
out, oh death. That was the saddest.

1112
01:06:12,161 --> 01:06:15,790
I saw a little bit of this
movie with Kevin. Kevin James.

1113
01:06:15,910 --> 01:06:19,960
It's a fucking good actor.
Good Act. I mean, I, my kids
watch when all these movies,

1114
01:06:19,961 --> 01:06:23,590
and not only does he do physical comedy,
but his face can do so much shit.

1115
01:06:23,591 --> 01:06:28,270
Even in drama. He's a powerful dude.
His, um, here comes the boom moving,

1116
01:06:28,330 --> 01:06:32,410
here comes the boom, movie's coming out
in October. And that's a movie where he,

1117
01:06:32,411 --> 01:06:36,950
uh, plays a MMA fighter. He plays
a guy, was a college wrestler.

1118
01:06:37,600 --> 01:06:39,680
He's fucking great in it, man. He can,

1119
01:06:39,681 --> 01:06:43,390
he can act and he can take those silly
high concept movies like that and

1120
01:06:43,391 --> 01:06:48,310
actually grounded enough to make it
funny. But this movie, anyway, he's,

1121
01:06:48,311 --> 01:06:49,860
he's about to,
uh,

1122
01:06:49,900 --> 01:06:52,190
his friends get to propose and he's
telling me how great marriages,

1123
01:06:52,210 --> 01:06:56,200
he's trying to drag them anyway.
And then the guy sees his wife cheating,

1124
01:06:56,470 --> 01:06:58,070
calls are on it. And she
goes, well, what do you,

1125
01:06:58,090 --> 01:06:59,260
what do you know about our marriage?

1126
01:06:59,261 --> 01:07:02,440
He goes and gets a fucking hand
job from a Thai girl every Friday,

1127
01:07:02,800 --> 01:07:06,550
and it all falls apart. You know?
And this guy wants to get married,

1128
01:07:06,551 --> 01:07:10,480
but he realizes that every married
person is spinning another fucking story

1129
01:07:10,630 --> 01:07:15,010
about their marriage. And to me
it's like you either stay married,

1130
01:07:15,011 --> 01:07:16,750
like getting divorced.

1131
01:07:17,050 --> 01:07:20,470
You should never do
until you need a divorce,

1132
01:07:20,560 --> 01:07:24,040
then you should get a fucking divorce.
But to live a lie in a marriage,

1133
01:07:24,220 --> 01:07:28,410
why not kill? You're not alive
if you're doing that. Yeah.

1134
01:07:28,450 --> 01:07:30,250
Some people just can't change.

1135
01:07:30,280 --> 01:07:33,250
They have a real hard time just
moving on to the next thing.

1136
01:07:33,390 --> 01:07:37,390
We'd have a really hard time
just changing. It's very
difficult for some people.

1137
01:07:37,540 --> 01:07:40,330
That's one of the things in this happy
movie, it talks about how the pain,

1138
01:07:40,690 --> 01:07:43,780
the thing that you think is gonna
be losing your job, going, bro,

1139
01:07:43,840 --> 01:07:45,070
even getting kicked out of your house,

1140
01:07:45,310 --> 01:07:47,200
it's not as bad as you
think it's going to be.

1141
01:07:47,201 --> 01:07:50,500
And the fear of it happening
controls so much of your actions.

1142
01:07:51,040 --> 01:07:54,340
It goes away right away. You experience
it and you're in a new reality.

1143
01:07:54,370 --> 01:07:58,870
All of a sudden I got no house. I found
another place. My life moving forward. Uh,

1144
01:07:59,320 --> 01:08:02,740
you keep on getting out of sync with
us for some reason. You're a camera.

1145
01:08:03,070 --> 01:08:07,030
And so I'm trying to fix it flashed.
I noticed that it flashed. Yeah. Well,

1146
01:08:07,031 --> 01:08:10,040
I'm trying to fix it right now, but long
was the audio is on. I'm going to be,

1147
01:08:10,060 --> 01:08:11,950
I'll be a man of mystery,
but it was weird.

1148
01:08:11,951 --> 01:08:15,650
It's like me and Greg would be talking
and then you would answer like five

1149
01:08:15,651 --> 01:08:16,070
seconds

1150
01:08:16,070 --> 01:08:19,850
on delay. So it was like me and
you were in a different world.

1151
01:08:19,851 --> 01:08:22,910
Didn't show this really trippy to watch.
I've been,

1152
01:08:22,940 --> 01:08:26,660
I fixed it once before then it
started happening again. Yeah.

1153
01:08:27,260 --> 01:08:29,080
You think it's because of
switching this laptop? Yeah,

1154
01:08:29,100 --> 01:08:32,870
probably switched to Windows. Yeah.
We tried to do the podcast at windows.

1155
01:08:33,050 --> 01:08:36,650
The iTunes version will be good. Ladies
and gentlemen, go get that audio version.

1156
01:08:37,000 --> 01:08:41,000
And as far as the video, uh, we gave
it a shot. Uh, wait, what is it?

1157
01:08:41,090 --> 01:08:45,050
We were broadcasting for the first
time today. It looks like it's, yeah,

1158
01:08:45,051 --> 01:08:47,030
I fixed it. I fixed it last
time it started happening again.

1159
01:08:47,330 --> 01:08:50,600
This is the first time we're broadcasting
the video portion of it off of a

1160
01:08:50,601 --> 01:08:53,840
windows computer when you've done
them before. Why? Because we have one,

1161
01:08:53,841 --> 01:08:56,810
we have this Alienware computer that
gave it to us. So we figured, well,

1162
01:08:56,840 --> 01:08:59,150
let's try it. Let's try it this way.
Normally you do it a different way.

1163
01:08:59,180 --> 01:09:02,790
Normally we do it through a Mac and
I mix it up, points in our head.

1164
01:09:03,650 --> 01:09:04,600
We decided,
uh,

1165
01:09:04,640 --> 01:09:08,850
we decided to see what would happen and
apparently there's some issues I want to

1166
01:09:08,860 --> 01:09:11,000
with the,
that's a fixable thing.

1167
01:09:11,030 --> 01:09:16,030
It's probably the power of the
laptop trying to handle three,

1168
01:09:16,160 --> 01:09:18,620
uh, uh, webcams at the same time.

1169
01:09:18,621 --> 01:09:22,220
So I'm guessing you get a weak ass bitch.
Well,

1170
01:09:22,221 --> 01:09:26,520
we went from an Imac, which
is topical line two, three,

1171
01:09:26,870 --> 01:09:30,020
three webcams or taken it down.
But that's a gaming laptop.

1172
01:09:30,021 --> 01:09:33,910
Those things or they have super power
when it comes slowly. Fix Cards. Yeah,

1173
01:09:33,950 --> 01:09:38,300
but wouldn't that have anything to do
with the information coming out of CPU?

1174
01:09:38,301 --> 01:09:40,190
I mean, you're doing three
webcams. I don't know.

1175
01:09:40,191 --> 01:09:43,250
And it's the power of powering and
here's why it's the wrong one. You know,

1176
01:09:43,251 --> 01:09:44,960
I should have brought
that big giant one in.

1177
01:09:44,990 --> 01:09:48,590
We should have tried it with that one
because that one is much more powerful

1178
01:09:48,670 --> 01:09:52,420
than you think. That would be a good
drive. Yeah. That's a lot of shit,

1179
01:09:52,421 --> 01:09:56,360
but there their computer sort of,
we're trying to do this.

1180
01:09:56,361 --> 01:09:57,770
Technically we're a mess

1181
01:09:57,950 --> 01:10:02,060
trying to do a two camera thing.
Backstab I'm doing a one hour special on,

1182
01:10:02,061 --> 01:10:06,200
we're shooting backstage
with multi cameras and trying
to stream it live before

1183
01:10:06,201 --> 01:10:10,790
I go on and uh, the directors all on
top of that shit. And I was just like,

1184
01:10:10,791 --> 01:10:11,400
you know why

1185
01:10:11,400 --> 01:10:13,770
you begin to be doing in the stream?

1186
01:10:14,910 --> 01:10:18,740
Just um, you know, I'm backstage, my,
my two best friends that I grew up at,

1187
01:10:18,741 --> 01:10:21,120
two biggest fucking troublemakers
because I'm shooting it in Tarrytown,

1188
01:10:21,121 --> 01:10:23,070
New York and these guys,

1189
01:10:23,130 --> 01:10:27,540
I can't even get into what they fucking
did cause one of them is the town judge,

1190
01:10:27,541 --> 01:10:32,520
the other guys, the fire chief is
a fucked up these towns are at. So,

1191
01:10:32,521 --> 01:10:34,170
uh,
so the special is going to be me.

1192
01:10:34,171 --> 01:10:38,280
They're pulling up somehow illegally
getting firetruck and pulling me up to the

1193
01:10:38,281 --> 01:10:41,520
front of the theater on a firetruck and
then at the end they're leading me out

1194
01:10:41,521 --> 01:10:44,350
and putting me into a police
cruiser and a tear it down.

1195
01:10:45,180 --> 01:10:48,750
So I want to have all my buddies back
page that I used to fuck around with

1196
01:10:48,751 --> 01:10:49,584
growing up.

1197
01:10:49,770 --> 01:10:53,130
All the troublemakers and just right up
until they announced my name and go on

1198
01:10:53,131 --> 01:10:55,590
stage. I just want to be
fucking around and laughing.

1199
01:10:56,150 --> 01:10:59,560
That's a great idea. That'll get your
really warmed up. Sort of like a,

1200
01:10:59,600 --> 01:11:03,290
when we do the Ice House to the podcast
we do right before we can show exactly.

1201
01:11:03,300 --> 01:11:06,320
Same sort of thing.
Probably inspired me to do it actually.

1202
01:11:07,010 --> 01:11:09,500
It's a great move a think about it.

1203
01:11:09,530 --> 01:11:12,050
Those are the guys that put
you in the frame of mind,

1204
01:11:12,080 --> 01:11:14,160
you know that made you a
comedian the first place.

1205
01:11:14,190 --> 01:11:18,000
Yeah. You get into the rhythm of making
them laugh and do that to the audience.

1206
01:11:18,440 --> 01:11:22,290
That is a, when you get a group of
guys and a couple of them were funny,

1207
01:11:22,500 --> 01:11:24,510
it can get pretty fucking crazy.
Yeah.

1208
01:11:24,570 --> 01:11:26,820
If you get a group of guys and
a couple of them were funny.

1209
01:11:27,390 --> 01:11:30,570
Well cause then you got the guys that
they're laugh keeps, keeps it going.

1210
01:11:30,700 --> 01:11:33,990
Then he got the guy you're all shitting
on. Yup. And you all know the dynamic.

1211
01:11:34,500 --> 01:11:37,740
It's like a gift. It's like a beetle. You
got four guys and they all have a role.

1212
01:11:37,770 --> 01:11:42,570
Exactly. It's hilarious. Who is
your, who is your guys growing up?

1213
01:11:42,780 --> 01:11:43,613
Uh,
well,

1214
01:11:44,140 --> 01:11:48,550
my two best friends when I was growing
up were two Jimmys and they were both a a

1215
01:11:48,551 --> 01:11:49,990
year ahead of me.
So they,

1216
01:11:49,991 --> 01:11:53,740
they were graduating and they
were both a tradesman one.

1217
01:11:53,741 --> 01:11:58,270
Jimmy's a carpenter and when Jimmy is
an electrician, just real normal guys.

1218
01:11:58,510 --> 01:12:03,280
And I lived with a one, Jimmy. Jimmy
did Teleo great fucking guy to this day.

1219
01:12:03,281 --> 01:12:06,190
I talked to him every now and then.
I really don't get to see him that often.

1220
01:12:06,191 --> 01:12:09,550
I saw him when I was in Boston
when it was there for the UFC.

1221
01:12:09,640 --> 01:12:11,680
Him and my other friend Jimmy,
Jimmy lawless.

1222
01:12:11,820 --> 01:12:13,420
Hey Sal. Both of them
together. Yeah. Yeah.

1223
01:12:13,421 --> 01:12:17,110
We hung out and then they brought
their kids. It's crazy. You know,

1224
01:12:17,111 --> 01:12:21,830
Jimmy Lawless brought his kid. It's just,
it's so weird. In Israel. Name is lawless.

1225
01:12:21,880 --> 01:12:25,620
Yeah, that's, he's a great guy too. He's,

1226
01:12:26,170 --> 01:12:30,880
he's been my buddy since we were like
15 as it just like, like all times.

1227
01:12:31,420 --> 01:12:34,660
Oh yeah. He's just a great
guy. Well you know the,

1228
01:12:35,050 --> 01:12:38,890
the thing that I've always said about
that life, the living that life in Boston,

1229
01:12:38,891 --> 01:12:43,090
it's a hard life to live
in that whether it's a,

1230
01:12:43,091 --> 01:12:44,020
it's a hard,

1231
01:12:44,620 --> 01:12:49,330
it's a hard place to grow up too because
people in Boston have like extreme blue

1232
01:12:49,331 --> 01:12:52,420
collar work ethic too.
There's like a lot of that up there too.

1233
01:12:52,600 --> 01:12:56,290
There's a lot of people that like when I
was in high school I felt so lazy cause

1234
01:12:56,291 --> 01:12:59,890
I knew like 10 dudes that had landscaping
jobs, they had their own like,

1235
01:12:59,920 --> 01:13:04,030
like series of launch. They would cotton
and they were hiring people and this,

1236
01:13:04,330 --> 01:13:07,600
I remember this kid was driving a brand
new car when we were in high school.

1237
01:13:07,680 --> 01:13:10,480
Like what the fuck? He always had
money. This kid is incredible.

1238
01:13:10,600 --> 01:13:11,250
He just figured it out.

1239
01:13:11,250 --> 01:13:15,180
I felt like such a lazy asshole because
this kid had figured out how to move and

1240
01:13:15,200 --> 01:13:15,551
hustle.

1241
01:13:15,551 --> 01:13:19,990
Like there was so much of that and I
grew up in Newton and Newton upper falls.

1242
01:13:20,410 --> 01:13:22,240
There was so much of that there.

1243
01:13:22,350 --> 01:13:25,010
But Newton is kind of right and
wrong side of the tracks isn't it?

1244
01:13:25,250 --> 01:13:27,530
Well,
my side of the tracks was just,

1245
01:13:27,531 --> 01:13:31,700
we just lived in a really cheap house
in a pretty decent neighborhood.

1246
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:33,950
I mean it was a cute little neighborhood,

1247
01:13:34,100 --> 01:13:37,550
but the houses a piece of shit and my
parents bought the house so that we could

1248
01:13:37,551 --> 01:13:41,840
be in the neighborhood so that get us
into a good school system because we were

1249
01:13:41,841 --> 01:13:44,870
in Jamaica plain before that,
which was like really shade

1250
01:13:45,730 --> 01:13:50,140
the area. Where else? Hey, make
me a fucking Sally's down. Jp.

1251
01:13:50,490 --> 01:13:51,630
Jp was shady.

1252
01:13:51,690 --> 01:13:55,390
I saw some crazy shit live in there
and just a couple of years it was a,

1253
01:13:55,391 --> 01:13:57,930
that was a tricky place. But you know, no,

1254
01:13:57,931 --> 01:14:01,700
nothing compared to like real bad and it's
not Compton or anything like that. But

1255
01:14:01,700 --> 01:14:06,170
there was that whole like
Italian, Irish, like you had JP,

1256
01:14:06,171 --> 01:14:10,910
you had uh, uh, not
Dorchester, but um, uh,

1257
01:14:11,020 --> 01:14:11,980
west Roxbury,

1258
01:14:12,050 --> 01:14:14,860
not Roxbury,
but west Roxbury right next to JP.

1259
01:14:14,861 --> 01:14:19,240
And it was like you weren't in Dorchester
but you could get your drugs there and

1260
01:14:19,241 --> 01:14:19,930
you know,
there was,

1261
01:14:19,930 --> 01:14:23,110
there was like people that had got just
enough money to get out of the really

1262
01:14:23,111 --> 01:14:24,780
shitty neighborhoods,
made it out to like Jane.

1263
01:14:25,090 --> 01:14:29,950
Yeah. We would go into Dorchester and
late at night and buy food at places.

1264
01:14:30,300 --> 01:14:31,600
And I remember we were at this place,

1265
01:14:31,601 --> 01:14:34,700
they were serving like steak
and cheese sandwiches and uh,

1266
01:14:34,770 --> 01:14:39,770
it was open really late at night
and this neighborhood was fucked up.

1267
01:14:40,270 --> 01:14:40,910
This is like,

1268
01:14:40,910 --> 01:14:45,910
it was like you were scared to expose
your money before you paid for it because

1269
01:14:45,941 --> 01:14:48,810
you thought someone would just snatch it
from you. Yeah. Like there was just some,

1270
01:14:48,960 --> 01:14:51,310
some wild,
crazy people there.

1271
01:14:51,460 --> 01:14:54,490
And they had this thick
plexiglass between the,

1272
01:14:54,500 --> 01:14:58,920
the server in you and they only served
you through like the slot. And uh,

1273
01:14:58,950 --> 01:15:02,200
they gave the guy the sandwich and then
the guy says, that'll be, you know,

1274
01:15:02,201 --> 01:15:05,330
x amount of money and the guys just
start screaming hardy page or you

1275
01:15:05,380 --> 01:15:08,530
motherfucker, you're trying to cheat me,
you motherfucker. And they were like,

1276
01:15:08,540 --> 01:15:11,110
I can't let it go. Let it go, let them
go, let them go. Just let them go.

1277
01:15:11,140 --> 01:15:14,860
Just let them go and they just let this
guy creep out on there and just hoping

1278
01:15:14,861 --> 01:15:16,510
that he didn't just blast them,

1279
01:15:16,750 --> 01:15:20,830
hoping that you didn't catch a
man on his last day. You know,

1280
01:15:20,831 --> 01:15:24,910
because you can, if you, you
know, especially if you live
in a big city, we fucking,

1281
01:15:24,940 --> 01:15:29,940
I guess you can get anywhere if you just
run into someone on their last straw,

1282
01:15:30,460 --> 01:15:34,210
like that guy just run into that guy
and they were like half of the sandwich.

1283
01:15:34,450 --> 01:15:35,530
Thanks.
Take it easy.

1284
01:15:35,610 --> 01:15:39,030
That's where you got to have instincts.
You know, you can take anybody in a city,

1285
01:15:39,120 --> 01:15:41,490
you know, you take somebody who's not
from a city and you put them in a city,

1286
01:15:41,880 --> 01:15:45,780
they don't have that instinct.
Don't let him go walk away or challenge.

1287
01:15:45,930 --> 01:15:47,640
There's times where it's
just a safe to challenge.

1288
01:15:47,770 --> 01:15:48,970
Yeah.
Sometimes with,

1289
01:15:48,971 --> 01:15:52,090
sometimes people talk too much and they
get themselves in trouble and they don't

1290
01:15:52,091 --> 01:15:55,150
know what a real fist fight is.
Like. They don't know what a real,

1291
01:15:55,270 --> 01:15:57,940
there's no rules out there.
Okay. That guy could stab you.

1292
01:15:57,941 --> 01:15:59,380
Like you don't even know this guy.

1293
01:15:59,530 --> 01:16:02,950
He might be from some other country
where you know they'll stab people on the

1294
01:16:02,951 --> 01:16:06,700
regular. I mean, he might fucking shoot
you. You don't know what you're doing.

1295
01:16:06,701 --> 01:16:10,420
Why are you fighting people? Like if you
could avoid it at all costs, avoid it.

1296
01:16:10,450 --> 01:16:11,283
Yeah.

1297
01:16:12,100 --> 01:16:14,970
Paul can be a subtle thing
too. Like when I, you know,

1298
01:16:14,971 --> 01:16:16,740
walking through New York
City all those years,

1299
01:16:16,980 --> 01:16:19,350
if I'd be fucking lower
east side late at night,

1300
01:16:19,590 --> 01:16:22,260
three black guys come from the
other direction. Not to be racist,

1301
01:16:22,261 --> 01:16:26,670
but the fucking reality is three
black guys walking past me in a bad

1302
01:16:26,671 --> 01:16:29,820
neighborhood. You fucking cross
the street. That's dangerous.

1303
01:16:29,821 --> 01:16:32,820
You've got to walk right at them.
You can't make eye contact,

1304
01:16:32,821 --> 01:16:33,511
but you don't look away.

1305
01:16:33,511 --> 01:16:37,620
There's a subtle way that people know
how to live in cities and if you,

1306
01:16:37,710 --> 01:16:41,880
if you fucked that up, you become
a victim. Like exponentially more.

1307
01:16:42,930 --> 01:16:46,030
Yes, absolutely. That's what
I mean by challenge. Yeah,

1308
01:16:46,250 --> 01:16:49,920
I know what you mean by that. Yeah, I
agree with that. Definitely. What I'm,

1309
01:16:49,950 --> 01:16:54,780
it was like people start unnecessary
altercations. I run, I just take off,

1310
01:16:54,781 --> 01:16:56,510
let's turn around.
I see a black guy had a cycle,

1311
01:16:56,880 --> 01:17:01,380
probably could outrun a black guy.
God was that racist?

1312
01:17:01,381 --> 01:17:02,310
What I just said?
No,

1313
01:17:02,560 --> 01:17:03,740
no,
because you're,

1314
01:17:03,741 --> 01:17:06,640
you're just admitting that white
people are scared of black people.

1315
01:17:07,390 --> 01:17:10,170
Yeah.
I'm more of black people and white people.

1316
01:17:11,160 --> 01:17:14,340
I can tell you, I mean, if you want
to be fucking totally rip myself open,

1317
01:17:14,341 --> 01:17:15,900
to be honest. Yeah, I am.

1318
01:17:16,070 --> 01:17:19,070
I'm not, uh, I think, uh,

1319
01:17:19,130 --> 01:17:21,380
physically more black
people can kick my ass,

1320
01:17:21,560 --> 01:17:24,530
but I think there's more white
serial killer. So interesting.

1321
01:17:26,050 --> 01:17:28,750
You're yelling, you're
going cereal. I'm with Greg.

1322
01:17:30,130 --> 01:17:33,040
I think a white people are just as creepy.
You're crazy.

1323
01:17:33,310 --> 01:17:36,010
I think my fear comes
from what I look like.

1324
01:17:36,011 --> 01:17:40,390
I think that as a white guy who's
not big with a receding hairline,

1325
01:17:40,450 --> 01:17:44,620
I think I look like somebody
that you could fuck with more.

1326
01:17:44,621 --> 01:17:48,160
And I think especially for black
people, I look and that, and it may,

1327
01:17:48,210 --> 01:17:52,540
and it's not true, but in my head,
in my fucked up view of things,

1328
01:17:53,020 --> 01:17:56,950
I think that they're seeing me that way.
I'm putting that on them. That's good.

1329
01:17:56,951 --> 01:17:59,830
Get you in trouble, man. I
got robbed by a black guy,

1330
01:17:59,831 --> 01:18:03,070
so I immediately think that you
never got robbed by a white guy.

1331
01:18:04,330 --> 01:18:08,210
I'm a white guy. I mean I'm,
I've only, they robbed once. So

1332
01:18:10,420 --> 01:18:13,540
hopefully in the future it's a white
person and an Asian person than a Mexican.

1333
01:18:13,541 --> 01:18:17,350
So you have a phone, multi racial
profile of people who have offended.

1334
01:18:17,351 --> 01:18:18,850
You don't even put that out there,
man.

1335
01:18:18,940 --> 01:18:22,300
I'm just to come back to you like the
secret and he's gonna start having hanging

1336
01:18:22,301 --> 01:18:26,350
around China town late at night so it
gets robbed there. Drunk pants down.

1337
01:18:26,351 --> 01:18:28,840
What am I going? I don't
know. I keep forgetting.

1338
01:18:31,690 --> 01:18:35,110
Can you give me directions? Totally
lost here. I'll give you money.

1339
01:18:37,060 --> 01:18:41,410
How many dudes are out there doing that
right now? How many dudes are out there?

1340
01:18:41,411 --> 01:18:46,230
Just fake drunk and Chinatown.
Yeah. Wow. I'm so drunk.

1341
01:18:46,530 --> 01:18:48,010
I might just do anything right now

1342
01:18:50,560 --> 01:18:53,050
pretending to pass out after
to let the guy fuck them.

1343
01:18:53,240 --> 01:18:56,410
A cop comes over and sees it and you
want to report this? Nah, Nah, I'm good.

1344
01:18:58,900 --> 01:18:59,500
Let it go.

1345
01:18:59,500 --> 01:19:04,500
How many times do you think cops interrupt
blow jobs on a given night in Los

1346
01:19:04,600 --> 01:19:05,040
Angeles?

1347
01:19:05,040 --> 01:19:06,960
It's amazing cause they don't even hide.
I mean you see,

1348
01:19:06,990 --> 01:19:10,050
you see prostitutes just bobbing up and
down. I wouldn't say it prostitutes.

1349
01:19:10,051 --> 01:19:13,480
I was saying someone just being someone
just getting crazy in the car. If you,

1350
01:19:13,640 --> 01:19:15,960
have you ever seen people do that?
Oh fuck.

1351
01:19:15,961 --> 01:19:19,260
I saw a girl given head while
driving down Pacific in Venice,

1352
01:19:19,680 --> 01:19:23,430
driving home from dinner with my wife
and were at a red light and I point to my

1353
01:19:23,431 --> 01:19:27,720
wife and that dude is driving an SUV
and all you see is this head and they're

1354
01:19:27,721 --> 01:19:30,030
higher than us. I can only see the
top of the head bobbing up and down.

1355
01:19:30,180 --> 01:19:33,870
And I look at the guy and he looks at me
and I'm expecting a fucking a thumbs up.

1356
01:19:34,140 --> 01:19:39,030
Nothing just looks at me. Look straight
ahead, heads Bob. And, and to this day,

1357
01:19:39,031 --> 01:19:41,580
keep his boner. This was five
or six years ago to this date.

1358
01:19:41,610 --> 01:19:43,920
Every time we're driving down
Pacific at that spot, I go,

1359
01:19:44,200 --> 01:19:46,330
I remember the time you
got check. Yes. I fucking

1360
01:19:49,370 --> 01:19:52,470
who's probably scared that you were going
to try to honk and ruin his blowjob,

1361
01:19:52,980 --> 01:19:57,090
who's panicking? Felt the
conflict, the IDI conflict.

1362
01:19:57,120 --> 01:19:58,470
It was losing his edge.

1363
01:19:58,750 --> 01:20:00,600
That's what the porn star saying
when they start to lose it

1364
01:20:01,330 --> 01:20:04,870
is there edge, I wonder what that
guy did at dinner. Cause like if I'm,

1365
01:20:04,990 --> 01:20:08,280
if I'm on fire dinner, you know, I put
the on my head, I'm getting laughs,

1366
01:20:08,280 --> 01:20:09,630
whatever.
Then I'm driving home.

1367
01:20:09,631 --> 01:20:12,270
She might hold my hand and I get some
sense that there's going to be action.

1368
01:20:12,420 --> 01:20:17,420
But how good was he had dinner that she
fucking started bobbing up and down on

1369
01:20:17,611 --> 01:20:18,090
them?

1370
01:20:18,090 --> 01:20:20,100
I don't even think it was Dennis.
The one that I saw.

1371
01:20:20,101 --> 01:20:21,390
I saw I was in the middle of the day.

1372
01:20:21,400 --> 01:20:26,100
It was oddly enough with Kevin James
that we're bringing real life and uh,

1373
01:20:27,420 --> 01:20:32,310
and he was right beside us and,
and Kevin spot it at first.

1374
01:20:32,730 --> 01:20:36,270
And uh, I was like, Holy Shit.
And Kevin was going to hit,

1375
01:20:36,271 --> 01:20:39,650
hit the horn and I talked about
it in though. He was just joking,

1376
01:20:40,140 --> 01:20:44,220
but the guy saw us and gave
us a thumbs up. That's guy.

1377
01:20:44,640 --> 01:20:46,230
The guy saw us and went like this.

1378
01:20:46,540 --> 01:20:50,320
Yeah. You pointed to it and it was pretty
funny. That was my closing pit. Remember?

1379
01:20:50,321 --> 01:20:54,250
For fucking years, it was like a
ladies, you've never seen this before,

1380
01:20:54,251 --> 01:20:57,760
but here's what we do when he gives a
blow job and then I just start pumping my

1381
01:20:57,761 --> 01:21:01,360
fists in the air and doing that.
I closed. I was so embarrassed.

1382
01:21:03,480 --> 01:21:08,140
Fitzsimmons killed man at fucking killed.
Wow.

1383
01:21:08,170 --> 01:21:10,990
Do you ever go back and think about some
of the shit that you said when you were

1384
01:21:10,991 --> 01:21:12,980
on stage?
You Go Wapo well,

1385
01:21:13,080 --> 01:21:17,440
you know Jim Florentine just put out a
CD called my first notebook and it's shit

1386
01:21:17,441 --> 01:21:19,090
that he was so embarrassed.
He used to do,

1387
01:21:19,091 --> 01:21:22,150
we found an old notebook and you went
out and he did all of it in a club.

1388
01:21:22,210 --> 01:21:25,090
He's putting down on a CD and
he's promoting, you're going like,

1389
01:21:25,091 --> 01:21:26,520
I don't know why anybody would buy this.
This is,

1390
01:21:28,760 --> 01:21:33,500
that's brilliant. Oh, that's
hilarious. That is done. Well,

1391
01:21:33,501 --> 01:21:34,820
that's not brilliant for everybody.

1392
01:21:34,821 --> 01:21:38,780
A lot of people go to all these fuck a
material blows. But for a guy like me,

1393
01:21:38,781 --> 01:21:39,610
it's brilliant.

1394
01:21:39,610 --> 01:21:41,260
Well, I think it's, it's interesting.

1395
01:21:41,261 --> 01:21:43,780
It would be interesting to people
in the same way that like, you know,

1396
01:21:43,781 --> 01:21:46,870
you hear the, the like Bruce
Springsteen, there's these tapes,

1397
01:21:46,900 --> 01:21:50,230
they're just called them the tapes, the
album. And it was when he auditioned,

1398
01:21:50,231 --> 01:21:54,430
the first time he drove in from New
Jersey and a fucking broken down Pinto

1399
01:21:54,630 --> 01:21:56,990
brought his acoustic guitar
and started playing, uh,

1400
01:21:57,220 --> 01:22:00,400
Mary Queen of Arkansas and all
these amazing fucking songs,

1401
01:22:00,640 --> 01:22:05,200
acoustic with different chord structures,
different pitches. And it's like,

1402
01:22:05,230 --> 01:22:09,670
it's fucking, it's not as good, but
you're riveted because you're like, wow,

1403
01:22:09,671 --> 01:22:13,960
this is, this is the fucking sketch
that led to this masterpiece. So I mean,

1404
01:22:13,961 --> 01:22:16,150
not that that would be the
equivalent with standup,

1405
01:22:16,151 --> 01:22:19,690
but I think it would be interesting
for people to hear maybe the,

1406
01:22:19,720 --> 01:22:23,680
what was the roots of a set they already
know rather than just a bunch of shit

1407
01:22:23,681 --> 01:22:24,514
you never did again.

1408
01:22:24,520 --> 01:22:27,850
Yeah, for sure. Yeah. If they
could hear it like after the fact,

1409
01:22:27,851 --> 01:22:31,840
like this is what didn't make the cut.
This is how the bid evolves.

1410
01:22:31,990 --> 01:22:36,990
The problem is when those
intermediate steps get online.

1411
01:22:37,660 --> 01:22:38,441
Yeah.
You know,

1412
01:22:38,441 --> 01:22:41,310
when you know they get ready to get on
the youtube clip or something like that

1413
01:22:41,380 --> 01:22:43,750
or you know, you see it and
go, oh but that's not even,

1414
01:22:43,780 --> 01:22:47,290
that's like the beginning of it. It's like
it's just growing. Like they're always,

1415
01:22:47,560 --> 01:22:49,420
they're always growing
up to a certain point.

1416
01:22:50,110 --> 01:22:52,960
But there's that really
fragile time for a bit.

1417
01:22:52,961 --> 01:22:56,570
When you're first doing the first few
times you're doing it on stage and not if

1418
01:22:56,620 --> 01:23:00,310
one of those got online, you'd be
like, yeah, that's, that's a steal.

1419
01:23:00,600 --> 01:23:03,090
Well, cause a lot of times
you're talking around the joke,

1420
01:23:03,091 --> 01:23:07,690
you haven't figured out
the bare construction of it
and you're describing the

1421
01:23:07,691 --> 01:23:09,190
joke.
Did it later will become,

1422
01:23:09,670 --> 01:23:11,720
yeah. That's a very good
way of putting it. And,

1423
01:23:11,930 --> 01:23:14,570
but I think when a lot of people don't
know that are watching standup comedy is

1424
01:23:14,571 --> 01:23:19,450
that while you're doing it, you know, you,

1425
01:23:19,680 --> 01:23:23,770
you're, you're barely even
thinking about what you're doing.

1426
01:23:23,800 --> 01:23:28,090
You're almost like writing it. You're
almost like when you really lock it in,

1427
01:23:28,091 --> 01:23:31,000
you know that feeling you get
when you're really killing. Yeah.

1428
01:23:31,001 --> 01:23:33,790
You're in the flow. You don't even
feel like you're a part of it.

1429
01:23:33,791 --> 01:23:36,610
Like you're witnessing it all happen.
That's exactly what I'm talking about.

1430
01:23:36,640 --> 01:23:41,190
The happy thing that that's
the flow. Yeah, well that's
what, you know, the whole,

1431
01:23:41,200 --> 01:23:43,180
the idea of being in the moment,

1432
01:23:43,181 --> 01:23:48,181
completely zen and locked into how the
universe is expressing itself through,

1433
01:23:49,150 --> 01:23:51,970
through whatever the fuck is going on
through either stand up comedy or through

1434
01:23:51,971 --> 01:23:55,360
music or through to car racing.
Whenever the fuck it is, man.

1435
01:23:55,800 --> 01:23:57,490
It's just that,
that,

1436
01:23:57,670 --> 01:24:01,480
that moment when it all works out,
you know,

1437
01:24:01,670 --> 01:24:04,700
and you come off stage, there's
nights you come offstage exhausted.

1438
01:24:04,701 --> 01:24:08,030
Those nights you come off with twice
the energy is when you went on.

1439
01:24:08,031 --> 01:24:12,520
It's like you just soaked in all this
energy and you just fucking ride.

1440
01:24:12,550 --> 01:24:15,710
It can last a full day where
you're just buzzing still.

1441
01:24:16,200 --> 01:24:19,050
Yeah. It's a, it's a weird Gig, you know.

1442
01:24:19,080 --> 01:24:22,860
And the weird thing about a uni is that
we've known each other since we first

1443
01:24:22,861 --> 01:24:26,520
started. You know, there's not that
many guys from our little group is you,

1444
01:24:26,521 --> 01:24:31,350
me Maguire, Tom Cotter, Tom Cotter,
three finalists. America's got talent.

1445
01:24:31,410 --> 01:24:36,240
Powerful. Tom cotter. Good
luck to you buddy. Um, I mean
there's, there's, you know,

1446
01:24:36,720 --> 01:24:38,600
not that many guys from that,

1447
01:24:38,990 --> 01:24:43,430
that small group of open Miker is that
we were in that like the, the, you know,

1448
01:24:43,440 --> 01:24:47,520
you think of open mycosis like classes.
Like this is the class of 1988.

1449
01:24:47,540 --> 01:24:52,200
There's a class in 1989 and we
were the 88 guys. Yeah. You know,

1450
01:24:52,720 --> 01:24:56,690
and it was an every couple of years it
was a very different brand of comedy that

1451
01:24:56,691 --> 01:24:59,270
would come out. Not very different,
but enough that you could detect it.

1452
01:24:59,350 --> 01:25:04,150
Yeah. There was challenges and trends.
And what was that Kid's name? Who was a,

1453
01:25:04,230 --> 01:25:05,980
uh, no, no, no.

1454
01:25:06,130 --> 01:25:09,820
The guy who was a irregular at the,
um,

1455
01:25:09,880 --> 01:25:14,380
at Nick's comedy stop.
He was sorta like Nick Depaulo,

1456
01:25:14,560 --> 01:25:15,710
but oh,
um,

1457
01:25:18,030 --> 01:25:22,410
he became like their regular
guy. Fuck. He's funny as shit.

1458
01:25:22,440 --> 01:25:26,550
Funny as shit. He never left Boston. No,

1459
01:25:26,610 --> 01:25:29,040
I forget his name kills me.

1460
01:25:31,450 --> 01:25:33,460
He's still a killer too.

1461
01:25:34,240 --> 01:25:35,110
He is a killer.

1462
01:25:35,111 --> 01:25:38,850
And that's the thing about Boston is
the guys that have figured out the,

1463
01:25:38,851 --> 01:25:42,610
the sort of formula that works in
Boston but are also an original voice.

1464
01:25:43,000 --> 01:25:44,950
It's just amazing how you can,

1465
01:25:44,980 --> 01:25:49,980
you can destroy when it's a match
of a comic versus a certain locale.

1466
01:25:50,321 --> 01:25:54,190
Like you take somebody like David Cross
and put them in San Francisco, boom,

1467
01:25:54,220 --> 01:25:57,640
locked in, they're going to
go for long rides with him.

1468
01:25:57,880 --> 01:26:02,530
You go to a, you know, Houston
with somebody like a, you know,

1469
01:26:02,531 --> 01:26:04,940
like what Bill Hicks was.
You take a southern and you put them down,

1470
01:26:05,120 --> 01:26:07,010
blue collar guy.
You put them in North Carolina,

1471
01:26:07,220 --> 01:26:11,870
but you take guys like Nick Depalo or
this guy and you put him in Boston and

1472
01:26:11,871 --> 01:26:13,640
it's just, it's explosive. What happened?

1473
01:26:13,840 --> 01:26:16,760
It's a match. You don't remember his
name. It's driving me fucking crazy.

1474
01:26:17,180 --> 01:26:20,890
It's really funny guy. But he just
stayed, you know, and I'm sure he does.

1475
01:26:20,891 --> 01:26:25,780
Well like in Boston, Paul
Nard Dizzy. That's it. That's
it. Beautiful. That's it.

1476
01:26:26,080 --> 01:26:28,420
And I remember that
kid was like the class,

1477
01:26:28,421 --> 01:26:33,421
I think of 89 I think he came a little
bit after [inaudible] 91 maybe 90 yeah

1478
01:26:34,440 --> 01:26:39,250
cause I was gone by I think
90 to 91 or 92 I was gone.

1479
01:26:39,700 --> 01:26:41,600
Might've been [inaudible] 90 it might
have left at the end of the day.

1480
01:26:41,770 --> 01:26:46,630
It was 91 91 yeah, definitely. But
he was really, really fucking funny.

1481
01:26:46,631 --> 01:26:50,900
I'm sure he still is. That guy was,
he was really good. Yes. So edgy.

1482
01:26:50,920 --> 01:26:53,400
The Shit don't rip a
hole in the million boom.

1483
01:26:53,460 --> 01:26:55,820
And it was like a hammer attack dude.

1484
01:26:55,821 --> 01:26:58,060
It was just hammer you over and
over again with another one.

1485
01:26:58,061 --> 01:26:59,900
Here's another splash line.
Another punchline. Yeah.

1486
01:26:59,970 --> 01:27:04,740
That's the rapid fire Boston style.
It's like the,

1487
01:27:04,790 --> 01:27:05,250
the,

1488
01:27:05,250 --> 01:27:10,250
the crowds in Boston were so hostile
that you had to develop this like really

1489
01:27:11,741 --> 01:27:15,910
energetic, like rapid fire style.
You have to be leaning forward. Yeah.

1490
01:27:16,020 --> 01:27:20,800
Mentally you got to constantly be up.
There was no sitting on the stool.

1491
01:27:20,830 --> 01:27:25,420
Get the fuck off the stool. Yeah.
Jesus. Sure. An entertainer.

1492
01:27:25,550 --> 01:27:28,820
Yeah. There weren't long
pauses. I mean, you know,

1493
01:27:28,821 --> 01:27:30,160
you start working the road and you,

1494
01:27:30,161 --> 01:27:35,030
you learn the value of a nice go get
a sip of water, fucking let them sit.

1495
01:27:35,090 --> 01:27:38,240
They'll kill you. Not Boston,
no way. Stay on the horse.

1496
01:27:39,560 --> 01:27:41,600
But it's also the, the, you know,

1497
01:27:41,601 --> 01:27:44,840
I find it a very Irish thing is that um,

1498
01:27:45,290 --> 01:27:49,760
you don't deserve to feel
good or have any pride.

1499
01:27:50,000 --> 01:27:53,960
And so Boston is about stripping it
away from you. So every joke is about,

1500
01:27:54,140 --> 01:27:57,590
you know, I go to the, you know, I go
to the fucking a tall both and the guy,

1501
01:27:57,591 --> 01:28:00,440
I hand them a 20, he goes,
you've got change. No,

1502
01:28:01,040 --> 01:28:05,080
that's your fucking job.
Your job is to make fucking change.

1503
01:28:05,090 --> 01:28:06,540
I give you a 20 year.

1504
01:28:06,650 --> 01:28:11,650
It's just like any fucking entitlement
is just fucking knock in a cold way.

1505
01:28:12,771 --> 01:28:16,520
Just knock the Shit Outta
you. Yeah. Like immediately.

1506
01:28:16,640 --> 01:28:18,140
And then there was no dissent.

1507
01:28:18,380 --> 01:28:20,070
Yeah.
Yeah.

1508
01:28:21,460 --> 01:28:24,800
100% right. There was no, no
entertaining and other sides of an issue.

1509
01:28:24,920 --> 01:28:27,020
Cambridge was an odd sort of a club.

1510
01:28:27,170 --> 01:28:30,230
Do you remember catch a rising star in
Cambridge, right? It's fucking club ever.

1511
01:28:30,231 --> 01:28:34,250
Maybe Tom was a great club
that was run by a site.

1512
01:28:35,120 --> 01:28:39,710
Then Robin here was,
who was quite a character,

1513
01:28:39,711 --> 01:28:40,670
but he loved comedy.

1514
01:28:41,150 --> 01:28:45,470
You left a certain type of be hated me,
but he came and he called me. He ate,

1515
01:28:45,650 --> 01:28:49,370
you go in and you audition for the guy
you do 10 minutes and then at the end of

1516
01:28:49,371 --> 01:28:53,780
it he either, he tells you right away
he goes, no or yes. And he said, no.

1517
01:28:54,340 --> 01:28:58,520
And I didn't give a fuck. I've always had
very thick skin. I go, well, uh, I'd like,

1518
01:28:58,521 --> 01:29:02,130
why? And he goes, well, I can either tell
you now or we can go on the back and sit

1519
01:29:02,130 --> 01:29:04,860
down and I can tell you exactly why.
I said, yeah, let's go on the back.

1520
01:29:05,100 --> 01:29:08,370
First words out of his mouth.
As far as I'm concerned.

1521
01:29:08,400 --> 01:29:12,870
You're just another cocky little
Irish puke. That was the beginning.

1522
01:29:13,440 --> 01:29:16,590
Wow.
That's fucking racist.

1523
01:29:17,220 --> 01:29:19,050
He didn't get racist with me,

1524
01:29:19,051 --> 01:29:23,070
but he said that I am everything
that he hates about comedy.

1525
01:29:25,860 --> 01:29:30,600
He goes, what you do is everything I hate
about comedy. Wow. And I said, oh, okay.

1526
01:29:30,780 --> 01:29:32,180
Well, I just didn't,
we don't like the same.

1527
01:29:33,540 --> 01:29:36,780
And then we have this like weird stare
down where he's like, it was a big guy,

1528
01:29:36,810 --> 01:29:39,750
thick motherfucker. It was a big guy.
Like I didn't want to tangle with them.

1529
01:29:39,870 --> 01:29:42,630
I didn't want to have to scrap with them,
but it was a,

1530
01:29:42,631 --> 01:29:45,450
it was an intimidation moment. It was
a, it wasn't a comfortable moment.

1531
01:29:45,480 --> 01:29:49,410
I didn't like it.
It wasn't like this is a smart,

1532
01:29:49,411 --> 01:29:54,411
friendly guy who should be managing a
comedy club and influencing comedians.

1533
01:29:55,230 --> 01:29:58,560
Everything had this heavy
leftists bent to it.

1534
01:29:59,070 --> 01:30:03,450
Everything had this
like Harvard socialize.

1535
01:30:03,950 --> 01:30:04,380
Yeah.

1536
01:30:04,380 --> 01:30:08,070
Barry Crimmins would sit at the bar and
if he didn't like what you were doing,

1537
01:30:08,100 --> 01:30:11,520
he would yell shit out at you.
Like he was like the dean of the club.

1538
01:30:12,460 --> 01:30:16,170
They were best friends and I love Barry
Crimmins. He's a fucking brilliant,

1539
01:30:16,171 --> 01:30:17,010
brilliant guy.

1540
01:30:17,011 --> 01:30:22,011
But back then he was drinking a lot and
he and those guys were on a mission to

1541
01:30:22,051 --> 01:30:25,980
create a place that they thought
was fertile for this type of comedy.

1542
01:30:26,160 --> 01:30:30,480
I was a the catch before ever did stand
up with a friend of mine from high

1543
01:30:30,481 --> 01:30:32,790
school,
Diane Derosa,

1544
01:30:33,900 --> 01:30:38,100
real nice girl and we're just
buddies sitting in the club.

1545
01:30:38,130 --> 01:30:42,480
And your boy Kevin Meeney one on stage.
This is before I ever got onstage myself.

1546
01:30:42,720 --> 01:30:45,360
And this was when Kevin
meaning was on fire.

1547
01:30:45,900 --> 01:30:49,020
Kevin Meaney was a fucking co rusher,

1548
01:30:49,021 --> 01:30:54,021
do Russia core Russia and you didn't
understand what he was talking about.

1549
01:30:54,240 --> 01:30:59,240
His big pants were a big pants people
and you'd be Corizon laugh and it was so

1550
01:30:59,971 --> 01:31:00,804
ridiculous.

1551
01:31:00,900 --> 01:31:05,190
And I remember leaving thinking God I
knew he was funny cause I'd seen him on TV

1552
01:31:05,191 --> 01:31:08,970
before but I like five cut five
tonight shows that year. Yeah,

1553
01:31:09,090 --> 01:31:13,470
I I but nothing like seeing them
like it's such a completely different

1554
01:31:13,471 --> 01:31:17,310
experience seeing a guy like that live
because he's like the silliness is not

1555
01:31:17,311 --> 01:31:19,140
that contagious when it comes to the TV.

1556
01:31:19,320 --> 01:31:21,240
But when you're in front
of that dude and he's,

1557
01:31:21,780 --> 01:31:25,500
he was fucking crush.
Hard to describe.

1558
01:31:25,501 --> 01:31:29,070
I saw him in that same club probably,
I don't know if it was the same weekend,

1559
01:31:29,400 --> 01:31:30,233
that era,

1560
01:31:30,270 --> 01:31:35,270
but when he came in the place was fucking
jammed and he went up there sweating

1561
01:31:35,281 --> 01:31:37,650
and a bow tie and a jacket.
I don't care.

1562
01:31:37,651 --> 01:31:41,250
And to this day I say when people
say who's the best can be, I say,

1563
01:31:41,280 --> 01:31:45,690
nobody has ever made me laugh as
hard in one set as Kevin Maney. Wow,

1564
01:31:45,780 --> 01:31:49,950
that's a good statement. I
stand by it. I believe you.

1565
01:31:49,951 --> 01:31:53,820
100% I might, I might. I, it's too
far of a distant memory for me to, uh,

1566
01:31:54,090 --> 01:31:55,530
to say that mine was just as good,

1567
01:31:55,830 --> 01:32:00,010
but I remember being blown away at how
funny it was. It was just so long ago.

1568
01:32:02,300 --> 01:32:05,880
He's silly and he would sing that song.
I don't care. And that was his theme.

1569
01:32:05,881 --> 01:32:06,691
He did not,

1570
01:32:06,691 --> 01:32:11,220
he was going to be this ridiculous
rip fucking torn kind of a character,

1571
01:32:11,270 --> 01:32:16,110
rip Taylor, rip torn and rip
tail or rip tail. He was,

1572
01:32:16,111 --> 01:32:17,640
the guy threw confetti and acting crazy.

1573
01:32:17,641 --> 01:32:21,120
It was like a little bit of an element
of that mixed with the guy who really

1574
01:32:21,121 --> 01:32:25,500
understood standup comedy. He was fucking
hilarious. He was in my wedding party,

1575
01:32:26,010 --> 01:32:27,600
really was one of my officers. Wow. Yeah.

1576
01:32:27,601 --> 01:32:32,100
I grew up in one town over from him and
my dad got him on stage is very first

1577
01:32:32,101 --> 01:32:34,740
time because my dad was big
radio guy in New York. Wow.

1578
01:32:34,770 --> 01:32:39,390
Kevin was a waiter and waited on my dad
and it would be funny and my dad said,

1579
01:32:39,391 --> 01:32:40,171
you should do stand up.

1580
01:32:40,171 --> 01:32:43,770
And he was friends with the guy at catch
and he got them on stage his first time.

1581
01:32:43,960 --> 01:32:45,880
I remember when we were open micros.

1582
01:32:45,940 --> 01:32:50,020
I always thought that was really
fucking cool. Like Holy Shit.

1583
01:32:50,440 --> 01:32:54,710
Fitzsimmons actually knows Kevin Meaney
like you actually knew Kevin Meeting.

1584
01:32:54,740 --> 01:32:54,920
Yeah.

1585
01:32:54,920 --> 01:32:58,120
And when you have problems or when you
were going through things you would ask

1586
01:32:58,121 --> 01:32:59,890
like Kevin Meeney questions.

1587
01:33:00,160 --> 01:33:03,720
I remember a several times
having conversations where
you are dispensing like

1588
01:33:03,760 --> 01:33:07,420
wisdom that Kevin Meeney told you about
standing up and we were talking about it

1589
01:33:07,421 --> 01:33:09,790
like, okay, yeah. Okay.
That makes sense. You know,

1590
01:33:09,800 --> 01:33:14,400
those early years when you're such an
old blind blabbering fucking moron up

1591
01:33:14,401 --> 01:33:17,890
there and trying to like, you
know, it has the seal your way

1592
01:33:20,170 --> 01:33:21,820
too. Oh, coconut water in the house.

1593
01:33:22,260 --> 01:33:23,970
Yeah, it was um, you know,

1594
01:33:23,971 --> 01:33:26,640
it was a time when I really
needed a mentor and he wasn't,

1595
01:33:26,641 --> 01:33:28,890
he wasn't a guy that brought me on
the road open and form all the time.

1596
01:33:28,891 --> 01:33:30,210
It was just more of like you said,

1597
01:33:30,330 --> 01:33:34,890
I could call him anytime and he hears a
guy who was this hot one hour special on

1598
01:33:34,891 --> 01:33:35,580
HBO.

1599
01:33:35,580 --> 01:33:39,150
Miss Uncle Buck comes out all the money
in the world and I come out to la and

1600
01:33:39,151 --> 01:33:41,310
stay with them.
You bought a Chrysler K card.

1601
01:33:41,311 --> 01:33:44,220
That's the kind of guy who was
fucking business, you know,

1602
01:33:44,221 --> 01:33:47,100
underneath all the silliness. He
was a conservative, simple guy.

1603
01:33:47,101 --> 01:33:48,540
So who was advice on comedy?

1604
01:33:48,720 --> 01:33:52,440
I especially respect it because I could
see this guy was going the distance.

1605
01:33:52,441 --> 01:33:56,010
This wasn't a guy. It was hot. It was
going to flail out, which you, you know,

1606
01:33:56,100 --> 01:33:59,670
to this day he's, you know, he's still
out there fucking banging it out.

1607
01:34:00,570 --> 01:34:03,840
That's awesome. Now he's out of the
closet and now he's getting know,

1608
01:34:06,190 --> 01:34:10,010
Bang it out his name.

1609
01:34:10,700 --> 01:34:14,330
I didn't know that he will.
I mean, I wasn't one of those
things where I was like,

1610
01:34:14,331 --> 01:34:16,190
well Duh. You know, I thought, oh,

1611
01:34:16,720 --> 01:34:17,620
I thought it was straight.

1612
01:34:17,770 --> 01:34:20,710
I thought he was straight to a lot of
people he'd been married to. Right.

1613
01:34:20,730 --> 01:34:24,000
When you married Roy, give a fuck. What
am I the inquired with the kid? No,

1614
01:34:24,130 --> 01:34:29,110
not only married. He met a woman out in
La. Uh, fell in love with her and uh,

1615
01:34:29,140 --> 01:34:33,100
called me. It was my babysitter who
lived next door to me growing up. Whoa.

1616
01:34:33,130 --> 01:34:37,720
Fucking weird. Is that, whoa. How
old was she? She's probably seven,

1617
01:34:37,721 --> 01:34:42,400
eight years older than
me or a Harvard Mba.

1618
01:34:42,790 --> 01:34:47,590
Real fucking successful type a personality
and a, yeah. That my dad had died.

1619
01:34:48,790 --> 01:34:53,150
Oh, there were a lot to be a fly on that
wall. That's my gene Simmons oppression.

1620
01:34:54,620 --> 01:34:57,380
Really? Is that what he says?
Joe Stuck in my innocence

1621
01:34:58,790 --> 01:35:03,710
to be a fly on that wall. Is he
currently ever show? I don't know,

1622
01:35:03,711 --> 01:35:07,670
man. We were trying to get a campaign.
Have him apologize. Bert Kreischer.

1623
01:35:08,450 --> 01:35:12,260
Bert Kreischer was on the x show
with him at Jensen was done,

1624
01:35:12,261 --> 01:35:16,160
and he said Gene Simmons treated him
more horribly than any human being he'd

1625
01:35:16,161 --> 01:35:16,994
ever met in his life.

1626
01:35:17,780 --> 01:35:21,830
And Burt said that it was just like
demoralize him because he was a huge kiss

1627
01:35:21,831 --> 01:35:26,120
fan who's a huge kiss fan, who was just
literally, and if you know Bert, I look,

1628
01:35:26,180 --> 01:35:28,820
I've known Burt since I
knew I met him back then,

1629
01:35:29,030 --> 01:35:33,950
but I've been friends with them for a
couple of years now. He's just a fun,

1630
01:35:33,951 --> 01:35:37,160
wild dude. And you, if you misread him,

1631
01:35:37,370 --> 01:35:40,070
you might go look at this annoying guy,
man.

1632
01:35:40,490 --> 01:35:44,500
I'm trying to relax before my
performance man. And so he a,

1633
01:35:44,570 --> 01:35:48,350
apparently it was like super rude to Burt,
which is we can't have,

1634
01:35:48,500 --> 01:35:51,260
well we can't have that.
That's not a surprise.

1635
01:35:51,261 --> 01:35:53,750
It was any kind of known for
being who he is. He's known,

1636
01:35:53,751 --> 01:35:56,630
but I met him and he was really nice.
It also makes me,

1637
01:35:57,110 --> 01:35:57,980
yeah,
but you know what that is.

1638
01:35:58,050 --> 01:36:01,880
That's the guy who treats different
people different ways, different status.

1639
01:36:01,881 --> 01:36:04,760
People get a different treatment.
Well is worse than just being a dude.

1640
01:36:05,570 --> 01:36:09,590
I wish I could have a personal experience
to share other than the positive one.

1641
01:36:09,591 --> 01:36:13,010
But meeting him was awesome.
Then he came to my comedy show,

1642
01:36:13,011 --> 01:36:15,740
him and his wife and his kid, his kid, uh,

1643
01:36:15,950 --> 01:36:20,330
got my shiny happy Jihad CD from
iTunes and he really liked it.

1644
01:36:20,331 --> 01:36:21,800
So is this thing fucking up again Brian?

1645
01:36:22,360 --> 01:36:26,250
And it's just kind of just can't keep up
with it. It just kind of wonky. Right.

1646
01:36:26,570 --> 01:36:30,140
We'll switch it back, we'll switch
it. But anyway, he was really cool.

1647
01:36:31,070 --> 01:36:35,450
His whole family is cool. They came
to a new year's at the Improv was fun.

1648
01:36:35,960 --> 01:36:38,810
But you know when you hear a story like
that where someone's like super rude to

1649
01:36:38,811 --> 01:36:42,440
a guy like Bert and like, oh man,
that's so hard to hear. Yeah.

1650
01:36:42,470 --> 01:36:44,780
Cause every now and then you
were here a story. Yeah, man.

1651
01:36:44,840 --> 01:36:48,560
I met Patrick Swayze one, she was a
fucking Douche bag and they're like,

1652
01:36:48,590 --> 01:36:53,390
was it really? Or what are you
really annoying? Which one is it is,

1653
01:36:53,391 --> 01:36:57,920
it might be that you might be really
annoying and somewhere along the line you

1654
01:36:57,921 --> 01:37:01,310
might've decided that he upset
your feelings and how many, I mean,

1655
01:37:01,340 --> 01:37:03,080
have you ever had like those weird,

1656
01:37:03,081 --> 01:37:07,490
like people who feel slighted
because artificially slided people?

1657
01:37:07,640 --> 01:37:07,851
Yeah,

1658
01:37:07,851 --> 01:37:11,570
well they're looking for it because
we're storytellers and we all want to go

1659
01:37:11,571 --> 01:37:14,420
back to our town or back
to our friends and go, hey,

1660
01:37:14,421 --> 01:37:17,600
I met Joe Rogan and they're going
to go really? What was he like?

1661
01:37:17,720 --> 01:37:20,540
And the truth is he said hi to you.
You shook his hand,

1662
01:37:20,900 --> 01:37:24,120
maybe said three words and then
somebody else did. Now they got it.

1663
01:37:24,230 --> 01:37:27,800
They got to fucking pull from
that a story for their friends.

1664
01:37:27,801 --> 01:37:31,230
So if there's a hint of you being
dismissive, they're going up,

1665
01:37:32,150 --> 01:37:36,860
they're going to blow it out because then
they've got a connection to you or he

1666
01:37:36,861 --> 01:37:39,200
was the greatest fucking guy in the world,
which I never want to fall into.

1667
01:37:39,201 --> 01:37:40,710
That can't be it.
I mean I'm total,

1668
01:37:40,790 --> 01:37:44,780
I go hang out after the shows in the world
and want to be the guy that I'll take

1669
01:37:44,781 --> 01:37:46,100
a picture with you,
but you know what?

1670
01:37:46,220 --> 01:37:48,950
Don't put your arm around me while your
girlfriend figures out how to snap a

1671
01:37:48,951 --> 01:37:52,550
photo on your phone for the first
fucking time of hugging people. Gregory.

1672
01:37:52,610 --> 01:37:55,760
I don't get that fellow big hug like this.
I don't mind the hug.

1673
01:37:55,980 --> 01:38:00,700
You know what I like? Is the armpit
on my shoulder, my shoulder. Oh,

1674
01:38:00,720 --> 01:38:05,420
the sweat. It just deal, man.
That's what it is. The guys,

1675
01:38:05,880 --> 01:38:08,250
he's flunking on you and I
bet your girl can smell it.

1676
01:38:08,251 --> 01:38:11,140
I bet it's some sort of a primal
thing too. Especially if homeboy,

1677
01:38:11,141 --> 01:38:12,210
he doesn't know any deodorant.

1678
01:38:12,240 --> 01:38:14,070
Like if you'd come home and
you're around your wife,

1679
01:38:14,190 --> 01:38:16,200
she probably feels like you got conquered.
That's right.

1680
01:38:16,680 --> 01:38:20,040
What is this a man on you? There's
man, you shown her. That's right.

1681
01:38:20,760 --> 01:38:23,310
Or she doesn't know. She just wants
to fuck you. It's just to know why.

1682
01:38:23,340 --> 01:38:26,670
How weird are primal smells
like mean isn't that,

1683
01:38:26,750 --> 01:38:29,670
doesn't that which puts women on
the coinciding menstrual cycle,

1684
01:38:29,700 --> 01:38:33,480
isn't it an affair mono thing?
Is that right? I believe
it is. I want to say it is.

1685
01:38:33,481 --> 01:38:36,280
I might be wrong, but I mean
how, how Prime Hill are we?

1686
01:38:36,600 --> 01:38:40,080
Women get around each other. They're
their menstrual cycles all coincide.

1687
01:38:40,140 --> 01:38:41,850
So if they all get banged,

1688
01:38:41,910 --> 01:38:46,320
they all raised their kids together so
the kids have friends. That's my theory.

1689
01:38:46,321 --> 01:38:47,740
Isn't there a thing about how your,
your,

1690
01:38:48,330 --> 01:38:53,020
your sperm count raises looking at
houses the fuck are you doing, you know,

1691
01:38:53,310 --> 01:38:56,850
what are you doing? I'm looking to see
what the comments are while I'm listening.

1692
01:38:57,060 --> 01:38:57,893
The comments,

1693
01:38:59,720 --> 01:39:03,330
your sperm count goes up when
you're traveling or something.

1694
01:39:03,410 --> 01:39:05,960
Of course you're ready to
conquer a new land. Yeah.

1695
01:39:06,030 --> 01:39:09,090
Your body knows it's not around. It's
normal smell. And you, your, your,

1696
01:39:09,091 --> 01:39:12,090
your dick gets hard when you go to
pick up your spear. Yeah. Traveling.

1697
01:39:12,100 --> 01:39:12,870
You're going to war.

1698
01:39:12,870 --> 01:39:15,300
I'm going to kill and your luck
cause we'll be home in three days.

1699
01:39:15,900 --> 01:39:17,670
How many people are programmed that way?

1700
01:39:17,671 --> 01:39:22,440
How many people from the life enrollment
times we're programmed to kill and fuck,

1701
01:39:22,790 --> 01:39:27,390
fuck at the same time. So I mean it must
be really hard to work that culture out,

1702
01:39:28,020 --> 01:39:29,190
calm that culture down.

1703
01:39:29,520 --> 01:39:32,940
I mean we're talking about the amount of
violence that we see on a regular basis.

1704
01:39:33,180 --> 01:39:36,480
Pretty fucking minimal. It can be a
pretty horrific in certain places,

1705
01:39:36,570 --> 01:39:40,260
but in America pretty minimal compared
to what it would be like if this was the

1706
01:39:40,261 --> 01:39:42,270
sword fighting days. Yeah. You know,

1707
01:39:42,271 --> 01:39:45,510
like on a regular basis people had to
deal with some shit that we couldn't even

1708
01:39:45,511 --> 01:39:50,340
fucking begin to wrap our heads around
with. Yeah. It was really about power.

1709
01:39:50,341 --> 01:39:53,670
It was what can I take and
he would do it with swords.

1710
01:39:53,671 --> 01:39:57,540
It would run into a city with sore to
chop everything up and take all the people

1711
01:39:57,541 --> 01:40:01,680
and take their goal and it fuck all
their women. I mean nutty shit happened.

1712
01:40:01,750 --> 01:40:06,060
And the world, like in nature, you
know, you destroy your, you know,

1713
01:40:06,061 --> 01:40:09,960
if you are competing with somebody for
a food source, if you're an insect,

1714
01:40:10,340 --> 01:40:15,270
you will start to kill the other insect
or you will find a way to destroy the

1715
01:40:15,271 --> 01:40:19,680
food starts for them so that they die.
But it's a weird thing of the,

1716
01:40:20,400 --> 01:40:22,110
when,
when people get into tribes,

1717
01:40:22,111 --> 01:40:27,060
especially where they become really
synchronized, like as this tribe,

1718
01:40:27,090 --> 01:40:27,481
this is,

1719
01:40:27,481 --> 01:40:32,250
this is us and we're going to go after
them and they never even would consider

1720
01:40:32,251 --> 01:40:35,760
the idea of taking them into
their ranks are like, hey listen,

1721
01:40:35,761 --> 01:40:39,670
we're just going to go plunder. What'd
you guys like to come with us? You know,

1722
01:40:39,680 --> 01:40:42,540
we could, we could be a big
army, we could all get together.

1723
01:40:42,750 --> 01:40:45,740
We'll take them as slaves, but they
never take them on as equals. I mean,

1724
01:40:45,750 --> 01:40:47,670
there was a lot of slave
holding back then. I mean,

1725
01:40:47,671 --> 01:40:51,200
it must conquer it and you fuck the women
and you took the dude's and say you're

1726
01:40:51,210 --> 01:40:54,700
slipped. Yeah. I mean how many people had
to live their life like that? I was lot.

1727
01:40:54,730 --> 01:40:55,240
Right.

1728
01:40:55,240 --> 01:40:59,020
That was free for how many years did
that kind of shit go on in this world?

1729
01:40:59,090 --> 01:41:00,050
Well,
the Old Testament,

1730
01:41:00,051 --> 01:41:02,810
the whole fucking book talks about
slavery like it's not even a sin.

1731
01:41:02,870 --> 01:41:07,870
It's in actually the seventh commandment
is thou shalt not covet thy neighbor's

1732
01:41:08,540 --> 01:41:13,520
wife, thy neighbor's house, I neighbors
donkey or thy neighbor, his man servant.

1733
01:41:13,550 --> 01:41:16,580
It's a commandment that
recognizes slavery.

1734
01:41:16,680 --> 01:41:21,660
Jesus Christ that wrap your
fucking head around the Bible,

1735
01:41:21,661 --> 01:41:24,390
baby.
Wrap your head around the,

1736
01:41:24,570 --> 01:41:28,230
it's funny how people choose to
believe in like parts of it. Yeah,

1737
01:41:28,370 --> 01:41:28,850
I know.

1738
01:41:28,850 --> 01:41:33,080
And the wording of parts of it as if it
wasn't translated from ancient Hebrew to

1739
01:41:33,081 --> 01:41:36,350
Hebrew to Roman fucking English,
and it's like,

1740
01:41:36,351 --> 01:41:39,620
and you're going to tell me about the
subtlety of the way he said gay people

1741
01:41:39,621 --> 01:41:40,580
shouldn't lie together

1742
01:41:41,320 --> 01:41:43,220
in 2000 years later,

1743
01:41:43,370 --> 01:41:46,760
my favorite is when people tattoo
biblical quotes on their body.

1744
01:41:47,330 --> 01:41:50,960
So you're really not supposed to do that.
Like it says it in the Bible,

1745
01:41:50,961 --> 01:41:54,050
you're not supposed to get
a tattoo. I'm like, yeah,

1746
01:41:54,051 --> 01:41:58,150
but I don't think Jesus meant it
that much. I also think it might be

1747
01:41:58,240 --> 01:42:02,050
fall under the first commandment or is
the second about thou shalt not have

1748
01:42:02,051 --> 01:42:05,620
graven images. You should not
have representations of God.

1749
01:42:05,890 --> 01:42:07,870
And I think by extension,
why are we hiding?

1750
01:42:07,900 --> 01:42:11,380
Why do we have fucking crosses with
Jesus hanging off the wall of that you're

1751
01:42:11,381 --> 01:42:14,710
isn't that kind of covered by
extension on the second commandment?

1752
01:42:14,711 --> 01:42:16,660
Do we want to his,
he is fucking bloody corpse.

1753
01:42:16,960 --> 01:42:20,980
So very strange practice to look
at that all the time. You know,

1754
01:42:20,981 --> 01:42:23,620
and the idea that you're
being reminded of the deity,

1755
01:42:23,621 --> 01:42:26,650
the one perfect being that existed,

1756
01:42:26,651 --> 01:42:30,180
oh thousands of years ago
and since then his followers,

1757
01:42:30,181 --> 01:42:35,020
her reverted to pedophilia and
fucking craziness and fear. Yeah,

1758
01:42:35,110 --> 01:42:38,890
I know. I know this coming that
has a cross on his arm and I don't,

1759
01:42:38,891 --> 01:42:41,260
I'm not friends with him,
but he always wears like,

1760
01:42:41,740 --> 01:42:46,040
like those like elastic band things on
his arm just to cover it up so no one

1761
01:42:46,050 --> 01:42:50,440
knows. Oh really? That's funny.
You get it removed. Yeah,

1762
01:42:50,441 --> 01:42:53,740
get a cover up. Maybe he still likes
it and he's hiding it from comics. Oh,

1763
01:42:53,800 --> 01:42:58,090
well it could be that some people
get too ashamed of being religious.

1764
01:42:58,120 --> 01:43:02,140
A lot of fighters get religious. It's
like he gives them something to, to,

1765
01:43:02,170 --> 01:43:06,430
to really lean back on, you know,
something to give them strength.

1766
01:43:06,580 --> 01:43:07,370
And you know,

1767
01:43:07,370 --> 01:43:10,960
I've always said that I don't have any
fucking idea whether there's a god,

1768
01:43:11,590 --> 01:43:13,530
I'm not a religious person,
but uh,

1769
01:43:13,690 --> 01:43:18,190
I leave anything up to
the idea of possibility.

1770
01:43:18,250 --> 01:43:21,950
I think anything could be
possible. Anything, well,

1771
01:43:22,000 --> 01:43:23,310
it definition

1772
01:43:23,310 --> 01:43:23,751
of God,

1773
01:43:23,751 --> 01:43:28,751
but to think that there's not some
power that orchestrated did miracle of,

1774
01:43:30,210 --> 01:43:34,110
you know, like we regenerating
DNA, all that shit. You know,

1775
01:43:34,111 --> 01:43:38,070
to think that there's not something that
can tell you that I know how big the

1776
01:43:38,071 --> 01:43:41,910
moon is going to be at what point in the
sky and fucking 50 years and be right.

1777
01:43:42,510 --> 01:43:45,840
You know, give me a fucking break of
course, whatever you want to call that.

1778
01:43:46,110 --> 01:43:50,910
I think that I always just default in
nature is God and fill in the details.

1779
01:43:51,200 --> 01:43:52,340
When, when, when I know more

1780
01:43:52,550 --> 01:43:53,180
well it,

1781
01:43:53,180 --> 01:43:58,180
it could very well be that there is an
intelligence to all of nature that we're

1782
01:43:58,341 --> 01:44:00,950
just not capable of, of, of tuning into.

1783
01:44:01,310 --> 01:44:05,420
It could very well be the trees and all
sorts of different parts of nature have

1784
01:44:05,421 --> 01:44:09,260
some sort of intelligence.
It just doesn't translate into words.

1785
01:44:09,370 --> 01:44:11,650
It doesn't try and translate into,
you know,

1786
01:44:11,660 --> 01:44:15,680
certain noises that we recognize with
certain images and certain meanings.

1787
01:44:15,950 --> 01:44:18,440
It could be some other form
of intelligence and it's,

1788
01:44:18,441 --> 01:44:21,740
it's super possible that the reason why,
you know,

1789
01:44:21,741 --> 01:44:25,280
we exist in this ever changing
world and this world is, you know,

1790
01:44:25,281 --> 01:44:28,850
being more and more hostile to people
is that it kind of recognizes us as a

1791
01:44:28,851 --> 01:44:31,730
threat. You know, the you,

1792
01:44:31,760 --> 01:44:36,680
if you have to think of this system
has got to be prepared for everything.

1793
01:44:36,710 --> 01:44:37,310
Okay?

1794
01:44:37,310 --> 01:44:42,310
There's a reason why certain animals eat
other animals and certain diseases kill

1795
01:44:43,971 --> 01:44:45,860
certain percentages of the people.

1796
01:44:46,010 --> 01:44:51,010
There's like this crazy corrective
system that goes on on earth and we agree

1797
01:44:51,591 --> 01:44:53,450
with that up until it gets to people.

1798
01:44:53,690 --> 01:44:57,310
We don't ever want to think that Earth
could ever look at us like, wait,

1799
01:44:57,360 --> 01:45:02,360
we might be some fucking cold that it
has and that the more we pull the fucking

1800
01:45:03,231 --> 01:45:07,640
fish out of the ocean and throw our
garbage in it and the more we pollute the

1801
01:45:07,641 --> 01:45:12,590
sky and change the temperature of it and
fuck the whole balance of it up and in

1802
01:45:12,770 --> 01:45:16,640
artificially change the levels of
certain things in the environment,

1803
01:45:17,030 --> 01:45:22,030
we should expect that the earth is going
to respond to this change accordingly.

1804
01:45:23,181 --> 01:45:27,170
It's going to try to push back.
I mean if, if it is intelligent,

1805
01:45:27,200 --> 01:45:32,200
if there's some real method to the whole
idea of this whole thing evolving from

1806
01:45:34,940 --> 01:45:39,940
hot ball of rock and lava and then
somehow or another acquiring water and

1807
01:45:40,881 --> 01:45:41,714
somehow or another

1808
01:45:42,750 --> 01:45:45,400
more matters, more elements
and more life forms. Yeah.

1809
01:45:45,410 --> 01:45:50,230
Just keep going and going and
going. And it's all it's, you know,

1810
01:45:50,290 --> 01:45:54,940
and it goes back to like a turn of the
19th century. There was a lot of, um,

1811
01:45:55,730 --> 01:45:56,440
uh,

1812
01:45:56,440 --> 01:46:01,440
so a social scientist and England mills
who talked about population naturally

1813
01:46:02,921 --> 01:46:05,290
controls itself, wars, disease,

1814
01:46:05,320 --> 01:46:09,610
that there is an actual healthy
number of people to be on the earth.

1815
01:46:09,611 --> 01:46:10,570
And because of science,

1816
01:46:10,571 --> 01:46:15,571
we've been able to just completely fucking
hyper below that number of people to

1817
01:46:17,441 --> 01:46:20,560
the point where we've staved
off and natural correction.

1818
01:46:20,561 --> 01:46:24,130
We haven't had war in any
real war and a long time.

1819
01:46:24,131 --> 01:46:27,850
We haven't had any fucking plague in
a long time. You know the play again,

1820
01:46:28,090 --> 01:46:31,740
19th during World War One,
1970 killed one out of three people in,

1821
01:46:31,800 --> 01:46:36,400
in Europe including, well the war and
the plate together. And you know, we,

1822
01:46:36,401 --> 01:46:39,580
if we had that now, people
would, they'd lose the shit.

1823
01:46:39,581 --> 01:46:43,300
People can't even imagine a devastation.
They don't think it's possible.

1824
01:46:43,301 --> 01:46:46,570
Whereas numerically,
it's beyond possible.

1825
01:46:46,571 --> 01:46:50,400
It's way overdue. Well,
there was a super volcano

1826
01:46:50,400 --> 01:46:54,500
warning today, um, somewhere,
God, I want to say that.

1827
01:46:54,750 --> 01:46:59,730
I want to say, I want to say
somewhere in the South Pacific.

1828
01:46:59,731 --> 01:47:02,160
I don't, I don't really
remember, but there was um,

1829
01:47:02,860 --> 01:47:06,570
a warning not to travel to this
particular area because it had been some

1830
01:47:06,571 --> 01:47:10,470
volcanic activity. Maybe someone a la, let
me know what the fuck it is on Twitter,

1831
01:47:10,950 --> 01:47:14,950
but we had a couple earthquakes at
the California hundreds, right? Well,

1832
01:47:14,960 --> 01:47:17,290
it wasn't hundreds. No Shit. Yeah. Well,

1833
01:47:17,300 --> 01:47:21,630
there's an area in Yellowstone where they
have thousands of earthquakes a year.

1834
01:47:22,050 --> 01:47:22,580
Thousands.

1835
01:47:22,580 --> 01:47:27,300
She should ask, not just Yogi
bear chasing boom, boom, boom.

1836
01:47:28,960 --> 01:47:29,970
Oh booboo.

1837
01:47:29,980 --> 01:47:34,980
What is another guy got killed by a
bear in Alaska and that's where you're

1838
01:47:35,081 --> 01:47:38,760
going? Yes. The hardest dark.

1839
01:47:38,830 --> 01:47:42,250
The guy who got killed by the bear was a
out there photographing it and standing

1840
01:47:42,251 --> 01:47:46,690
near it way closer than what they
tell you too. He was within 50 yards.

1841
01:47:46,691 --> 01:47:50,710
Like you should never get within 50 yards,
50 yards. That's, yeah, that seems far.

1842
01:47:50,770 --> 01:47:53,770
Yup. Yeah. You should
be far as fuck. Yeah.

1843
01:47:53,850 --> 01:47:58,300
You shouldn't make clothes because
you most likely you'll be fine.

1844
01:47:58,450 --> 01:48:03,450
But if you get too close to a bear and
he decides for whatever reason that he

1845
01:48:03,611 --> 01:48:07,270
hasn't eaten in a while, and you might see
if you're at a ball, if he's desperate,

1846
01:48:07,510 --> 01:48:10,390
you can catch a desperate bear,
especially late in the year,

1847
01:48:10,420 --> 01:48:13,090
like when it gets close to like December,
you know,

1848
01:48:13,091 --> 01:48:14,830
some of those barriers
are still walking around.

1849
01:48:15,130 --> 01:48:17,710
Those are the dangerous ones cause
they're not stuffed yet. They're not,

1850
01:48:17,830 --> 01:48:21,930
they're not ready to hibernate. That's
how that grizzly man God got got. Yeah,

1851
01:48:22,390 --> 01:48:26,230
he went wandering around out there after.
It was like post season when they were,

1852
01:48:26,231 --> 01:48:28,750
uh, the, most of the healthy bears
are already in heartland nation.

1853
01:48:28,960 --> 01:48:31,780
It's like being in Faneuil hall at two
in the morning when the bars get out.

1854
01:48:31,900 --> 01:48:36,840
Exactly. If you're not home, the
ancients, last chance for romance,

1855
01:48:36,910 --> 01:48:39,780
you didn't get laid and now you're going
to look for a fight. And that's what,

1856
01:48:39,781 --> 01:48:40,900
what happened at two 15.

1857
01:48:40,970 --> 01:48:44,210
That one little, uh, what is it? A
fast food place? It a Mcdonald's.

1858
01:48:44,220 --> 01:48:45,150
It's on the corner of that.

1859
01:48:45,151 --> 01:48:46,980
That was why that hotel that
we used to stay out of it.

1860
01:48:46,990 --> 01:48:50,480
We would go to Faneuil hall.
Remember that place that we worked at?

1861
01:48:50,481 --> 01:48:51,314
The comedy connection then

1862
01:48:51,680 --> 01:48:54,680
it was a chain, you remember
the thing was called Donald's,

1863
01:48:54,760 --> 01:48:58,710
but like it wasn't
Mcdonnell Ari and Brian,

1864
01:48:58,820 --> 01:49:02,640
Wendy's Ren Brian walked there
and almost got in a fight. Yeah.

1865
01:49:02,650 --> 01:49:06,260
Like twice and just waiting in line
everywhere it goes. And you know,

1866
01:49:06,261 --> 01:49:09,110
I didn't like Boston the
first, like three, two times.

1867
01:49:09,111 --> 01:49:12,500
We went there because we kept on going
to that comedy club in that area.

1868
01:49:13,010 --> 01:49:16,820
And then they call it the combat zone.
It's like one bad block and awful.

1869
01:49:16,821 --> 01:49:18,460
And then we, the last time we
went, we went somewhere else.

1870
01:49:18,480 --> 01:49:20,590
We stayed in this really nice
hotel and they're filming a movie.

1871
01:49:20,600 --> 01:49:21,590
There's all these actors in it,

1872
01:49:21,770 --> 01:49:23,600
but it wasn't like a totally
different experience.

1873
01:49:23,601 --> 01:49:25,970
It was like being in New
York on Monday, we were, um,

1874
01:49:26,180 --> 01:49:28,900
we were at the connection and Faneuil
hall wasn't in the comments. Okay.

1875
01:49:28,930 --> 01:49:33,770
Wasn't there, but the connection
was, uh, yeah, the, the,
the Wilbur is actually, oh,

1876
01:49:34,250 --> 01:49:36,470
like go a way cooler set.
You know,

1877
01:49:36,471 --> 01:49:40,040
it's a beautiful environment
and everything like that.
But that area is not,

1878
01:49:40,310 --> 01:49:43,790
it's not the dangerous area.
It was when we were doing standup,

1879
01:49:43,910 --> 01:49:45,620
like people don't understand the fucking,

1880
01:49:45,920 --> 01:49:48,040
they have like a four seasons there now.
You know,

1881
01:49:48,040 --> 01:49:51,790
it's, it's a gorgeous area. When
we were coming up and stand up,

1882
01:49:51,820 --> 01:49:55,150
it was the combat zone. You would walk
over there, they would be hookers.

1883
01:49:55,151 --> 01:49:57,520
It was scary.
You'd see people smoking crack,

1884
01:49:57,670 --> 01:50:02,140
you would see peep show booze and they
slowly squeezed all that shit out.

1885
01:50:02,170 --> 01:50:03,790
That was like our one CD

1886
01:50:03,920 --> 01:50:04,341
area.

1887
01:50:04,341 --> 01:50:08,450
I remember I could always park on the
street because nobody would park on the

1888
01:50:08,451 --> 01:50:10,790
street that had a piece
of shit because you're,

1889
01:50:10,970 --> 01:50:13,760
my window got smashed so many
fucking times. You just were,

1890
01:50:13,761 --> 01:50:14,630
you were just used to it.

1891
01:50:14,940 --> 01:50:17,800
Yeah. That area around
next man, you got your,

1892
01:50:17,801 --> 01:50:19,830
your fucking car got
broken into all the time.

1893
01:50:19,831 --> 01:50:23,250
Unless you've got a spot on that street,
on warrant and street.

1894
01:50:23,400 --> 01:50:26,610
When you would go around that little side
area where the connection was the old

1895
01:50:26,611 --> 01:50:28,830
connection and go down to
the end where Nick's was.

1896
01:50:28,831 --> 01:50:32,310
Every now and then he'd catch a spot.
You get super fucking lucky. Yeah.

1897
01:50:32,670 --> 01:50:34,930
But that whole area is
a gay bar. No. Do Dude

1898
01:50:35,250 --> 01:50:37,420
is detective Byrd.

1899
01:50:40,680 --> 01:50:44,390
Uh, yeah, that much with the cubs game.
Like a really a hot gate. Will you let me,

1900
01:50:47,320 --> 01:50:48,290
let me get in the back door.

1901
01:50:50,050 --> 01:50:53,200
You went with a bug door line,
Fred Sammons cheeses.

1902
01:50:53,780 --> 01:50:58,220
Um, but the, yeah, that area. Um,
at one point in time it was uh,

1903
01:50:58,280 --> 01:51:03,280
there was two comedy clubs in the same
theater where the same area where the

1904
01:51:03,981 --> 01:51:06,480
connection was. There was the
connection. And then above it and my,

1905
01:51:06,580 --> 01:51:10,810
my car cat a place, remember that?
I don't remember my Clarks. Yeah.

1906
01:51:10,910 --> 01:51:14,300
He had some sort of a comedy club.
It was, it wasn't for a long time.

1907
01:51:14,480 --> 01:51:17,780
It was in the same theater that they
used to do the heads like some long ass

1908
01:51:17,781 --> 01:51:19,880
running show. One of those fucking, oh,

1909
01:51:19,881 --> 01:51:22,750
you're talking about above
the original comedy. Oh yeah.

1910
01:51:23,030 --> 01:51:25,310
Upstairs they had some kind
of a nun's you one of those,

1911
01:51:25,840 --> 01:51:30,050
he's a little run or some fucking shit
done sense. I think that's nonsense.

1912
01:51:30,080 --> 01:51:34,040
None Sanity. Um, and then down
the street you had Nick's,

1913
01:51:34,100 --> 01:51:38,990
which had three different rooms,
50 yards away, 50 yards away.

1914
01:51:38,990 --> 01:51:43,550
They had an upstairs and then they
had two downstairs, one smaller room,

1915
01:51:43,700 --> 01:51:45,620
and then one that was like a disco.

1916
01:51:45,650 --> 01:51:49,370
You remember the disco Rome that didn't
really make it that they got rid of the

1917
01:51:49,371 --> 01:51:53,300
disco after awhile. It's like too
crazy. But guys would do that.

1918
01:51:53,360 --> 01:51:57,830
And then across the street there was
the fucking duck soup at what's now the

1919
01:51:57,831 --> 01:52:02,810
Wilbur theater. Duck soup was
the, the idea of a Billy Downs.

1920
01:52:02,811 --> 01:52:07,811
And Paul Barkley had this idea to put a
super upscale comedy club and put it in

1921
01:52:08,631 --> 01:52:12,740
Boston right there and charge more money
and have only clean comedians. Yeah.

1922
01:52:13,520 --> 01:52:14,210
And it didn't work.

1923
01:52:14,210 --> 01:52:16,700
It didn't work. But then you
forgetting dicta already had a room.

1924
01:52:16,701 --> 01:52:20,150
If you walk then across the
street and through a mini mall,

1925
01:52:20,330 --> 01:52:23,410
there was the comedy vault,
which had been a bank. Yes.

1926
01:52:23,450 --> 01:52:26,750
And the fucking room was,
the fault was still there.

1927
01:52:27,170 --> 01:52:28,850
And you would stand in
this little fucking room.

1928
01:52:28,851 --> 01:52:31,860
That was a bag and it was a sweet little
room. It's gray room. But I mean it's,

1929
01:52:31,940 --> 01:52:36,410
you're talking about within
literally within a quarter of a mile,

1930
01:52:36,440 --> 01:52:39,590
you had even three, four, five, six,

1931
01:52:39,770 --> 01:52:41,660
six comedy rooms and they were all

1932
01:52:41,770 --> 01:52:46,160
good. Yeah, it's ridiculous. We're
becoming those, those annoying

1933
01:52:46,160 --> 01:52:48,830
old dudes to keep repeating
stories about the glory days.

1934
01:52:49,190 --> 01:52:52,970
But what people don't understand is just
how, that's by the way, that's a meme.

1935
01:52:53,030 --> 01:52:53,960
What people don't understand.

1936
01:52:54,380 --> 01:52:57,620
Cause I always say that when I don't know
exactly what am I saying next time is

1937
01:52:57,621 --> 01:53:02,540
that the, the scene was just to
us now today, looking back on it,

1938
01:53:02,541 --> 01:53:06,950
as you know, you see what's around today.
It's so, it was such a spectacular scene.

1939
01:53:07,100 --> 01:53:11,090
It was just the most amazing scene
for like developing as a comedian.

1940
01:53:11,580 --> 01:53:14,220
Well you look at like, did you
read the book outliers? No.

1941
01:53:14,490 --> 01:53:19,490
It's this book about how people like
Bill Gates came about at a certain time.

1942
01:53:20,820 --> 01:53:24,480
They had a certain gift that
wasn't necessarily a good thing.

1943
01:53:24,510 --> 01:53:28,290
Like I think gates is mildly Asperger's.
He was born,

1944
01:53:28,350 --> 01:53:32,850
he was born in the Santa Cruz area just
as the tech thing was exploding and he

1945
01:53:32,851 --> 01:53:33,870
used,
I think it was Santa Cruz,

1946
01:53:33,871 --> 01:53:38,640
whatever the UC college had the first
like mainframe computer as a teenager.

1947
01:53:38,641 --> 01:53:40,410
He was going in there
and writing programs.

1948
01:53:40,680 --> 01:53:45,510
So he was at the beginning of a wave
with the exact personality type and he

1949
01:53:45,511 --> 01:53:49,020
carried it through and became
something that you can't do again.

1950
01:53:49,021 --> 01:53:51,480
And like Howard stern was
an outlier with radio.

1951
01:53:51,481 --> 01:53:55,410
He became the guy who did all the things
you weren't supposed to do on radio,

1952
01:53:55,590 --> 01:53:56,191
bad mouth,

1953
01:53:56,191 --> 01:54:01,191
other people be dirty self aggrandize
and all the sudden this wave of

1954
01:54:01,201 --> 01:54:05,880
syndication of radio stations came about
and he fucking caught that wave and

1955
01:54:05,881 --> 01:54:10,700
took and with talent. This is talent
God given fucking, uh, you know,

1956
01:54:10,780 --> 01:54:15,780
a weird recipe for what matches the
demands of that time and being in front of

1957
01:54:16,891 --> 01:54:18,060
the explosion that happens.

1958
01:54:18,061 --> 01:54:23,040
And I believe that we were very much in
the outliers spot of standup comedy by

1959
01:54:23,041 --> 01:54:24,420
being Boston at that time.

1960
01:54:24,860 --> 01:54:26,690
It was a very unusual
environment for sure.

1961
01:54:26,720 --> 01:54:28,340
It's sad that it doesn't exist anymore.

1962
01:54:28,370 --> 01:54:31,850
It's when a friend saw me to put out
that documentary when standup stood out.

1963
01:54:31,880 --> 01:54:34,800
Yeah. And it's really interesting, but I
think he kind of nailed it is that the,

1964
01:54:34,801 --> 01:54:38,660
the scene was fantastic until
people started making it when, uh,

1965
01:54:38,930 --> 01:54:40,670
when everybody just wanted to be funny.

1966
01:54:40,720 --> 01:54:43,190
You are one of the first
ones. No, no. Yeah,

1967
01:54:43,191 --> 01:54:46,610
I remember Joe Rogan cause everybody's
back. They're gone. But you hear Joe,

1968
01:54:46,670 --> 01:54:50,180
Joe moved here. Dude, he's, he gets to
do the prompt shows the danger fields.

1969
01:54:50,480 --> 01:54:53,810
That was literally like, people
were like me making this shit. Well,

1970
01:54:53,811 --> 01:54:57,980
I'm just saying in steps and then
Joe Rogan just signed with a a what?

1971
01:54:58,090 --> 01:55:01,280
Jeff's then all of a sudden Joe Rogan
just got out a hundred thousand dollar

1972
01:55:01,281 --> 01:55:05,360
deal with Disney and we knew every detail
your fucking career because nobody had

1973
01:55:05,361 --> 01:55:06,290
done that before.

1974
01:55:06,530 --> 01:55:11,530
Nobody from our class had gone
anywhere really except like,

1975
01:55:11,770 --> 01:55:11,990
you know,

1976
01:55:11,990 --> 01:55:16,550
I remember a Budd Friedman came to Boston
and did a showcase to do evening at

1977
01:55:16,551 --> 01:55:17,570
the Improv and we,

1978
01:55:17,571 --> 01:55:21,280
it was like the for months we were
fucking obsessed with our set and a couple

1979
01:55:21,300 --> 01:55:23,300
people got it out of it.
And uh,

1980
01:55:23,301 --> 01:55:27,110
and that was our closest brush to show
business until you all of a sudden God on

1981
01:55:27,111 --> 01:55:30,140
this fucking track. And it was like, wow,

1982
01:55:30,141 --> 01:55:34,760
you can do that from this.
So you ruined everything.

1983
01:55:35,650 --> 01:55:36,430
That was real.

1984
01:55:36,430 --> 01:55:39,190
Well everybody thought for some reason
that the only way you would ever get on

1985
01:55:39,191 --> 01:55:40,420
TVs if you were clean.

1986
01:55:40,720 --> 01:55:44,040
And I thought the only way I would ever
want to do comedy as if I was funny.

1987
01:55:44,130 --> 01:55:48,780
So I knew I wasn't good and because I
wasn't good, my dirty comedy wasn't,

1988
01:55:49,050 --> 01:55:53,370
it was unbearable because it's like
not as, it just not, is it offensive?

1989
01:55:53,371 --> 01:55:56,460
Not only is it offensive, but it's
also bad. It's bad and offensive,

1990
01:55:56,461 --> 01:56:00,660
which is like way worse. Yeah. Yeah.
Well in the beginning I think, I think,

1991
01:56:00,690 --> 01:56:04,800
you know, take, took a while for me
to figure out how to do it right,

1992
01:56:04,801 --> 01:56:06,810
how to do shit that I
actually thought it was funny,

1993
01:56:07,500 --> 01:56:11,520
but I knew I could never do it clean. I
just wasn't going to try. I just was like,

1994
01:56:11,521 --> 01:56:13,350
nope. I just, I, I, I fall,

1995
01:56:13,410 --> 01:56:15,990
I'll scratch together some little
five minute sets here and there,

1996
01:56:15,991 --> 01:56:18,660
but that seems crazy.
Like why would I do that?

1997
01:56:18,661 --> 01:56:20,250
Why would I limit what I'm thinking about?

1998
01:56:20,260 --> 01:56:24,180
Why it seems like that's like step
one to fucking yourself. You know?

1999
01:56:24,690 --> 01:56:27,270
I just got lucky that it worked.
It didn't have to work.

2000
01:56:27,271 --> 01:56:31,080
It could have skid off into the fucking
woods and I could have become some kind

2001
01:56:31,081 --> 01:56:31,730
of an,

2002
01:56:31,730 --> 01:56:34,550
the thing about that time though,
there was no roadmap for it.

2003
01:56:34,551 --> 01:56:36,680
And that's what an outlier is.
It's like you're the,

2004
01:56:36,820 --> 01:56:41,270
you're a pioneer in the sense that
you're breaking the rules and yet you're

2005
01:56:41,271 --> 01:56:45,290
rising up faster than anybody else because
things change and there becomes the,

2006
01:56:45,291 --> 01:56:48,860
you know, the needs and the demands of
the marketplace for whatever it is you do.

2007
01:56:49,240 --> 01:56:52,370
A, they change very kooky.
They're dynamic and the, and the,

2008
01:56:52,460 --> 01:56:57,200
and it's why we have the, you know,
variation and species. It's Darwinism.

2009
01:56:57,630 --> 01:57:00,520
Yeah. And it's, I've also felt like when,

2010
01:57:00,570 --> 01:57:02,790
when anything happens to that it's good,

2011
01:57:02,850 --> 01:57:05,460
then you actually believe
that good things can happen.

2012
01:57:05,520 --> 01:57:08,940
So for me it's like believing
that something good can happen.

2013
01:57:09,360 --> 01:57:11,610
Like all I could think
of was, well, you know,

2014
01:57:11,640 --> 01:57:16,160
if I keep working at this more good things
can happen. Like I'm on a roll and I,

2015
01:57:16,161 --> 01:57:20,520
I don't want to stop this role.
And so I think, um, you know,

2016
01:57:20,521 --> 01:57:23,070
when you're a young guy and you know,

2017
01:57:23,071 --> 01:57:25,530
your life has been like
Kinda like half sketchy,

2018
01:57:25,531 --> 01:57:27,330
filled with a lot of fucking failures,

2019
01:57:28,110 --> 01:57:30,770
all relationship failure is all like,
oh,

2020
01:57:30,780 --> 01:57:35,070
just different failures
that you go through and then
you're on stage and you're

2021
01:57:35,071 --> 01:57:36,090
trying to do comedy.

2022
01:57:36,091 --> 01:57:40,980
Like just trying to make sense
of that aspect of your past.

2023
01:57:41,040 --> 01:57:42,400
When you look back on your,

2024
01:57:42,420 --> 01:57:47,280
your life of being an open miker
and that the wild experience of,

2025
01:57:47,281 --> 01:57:49,560
you know,
trying to fucking do that for a living,

2026
01:57:49,950 --> 01:57:51,860
it doesn't even feel like
it's you does it, I mean,

2027
01:57:51,880 --> 01:57:54,900
doesn't it feel like it's a lie,
you know, it feels like you're,

2028
01:57:54,901 --> 01:57:58,500
you're accessing memories that were copied
a hundred times over and they're real

2029
01:57:58,501 --> 01:57:59,670
shitty and you like,

2030
01:58:00,000 --> 01:58:04,840
I think it was this Guy Larry Rowe
poochie yeah, yeah. Larry Alario Gucci.

2031
01:58:04,841 --> 01:58:05,520
Yeah.
Yeah,

2032
01:58:05,520 --> 01:58:05,791
yeah.

2033
01:58:05,791 --> 01:58:10,791
And I think I wore shirts that had zipper
is going down the arms and I think I

2034
01:58:10,981 --> 01:58:14,700
had a mullet and I think I did a joke
about what I do and girls are calling me

2035
01:58:14,910 --> 01:58:15,760
and none of it's,
and,

2036
01:58:15,800 --> 01:58:20,550
and I also look at it like limitless
fucking energy and passion.

2037
01:58:20,551 --> 01:58:24,630
I would tape every set, rewrite it.
I would fucking drive me anyway.

2038
01:58:24,640 --> 01:58:27,750
We would drive all over the fucking
place. It was, there was no limit.

2039
01:58:27,751 --> 01:58:30,750
And then I'd get up at the crack of dawn
and do fucking banquet waitering and

2040
01:58:30,751 --> 01:58:34,910
then I would go audition for some
cold call bullshit downtown. I mean,

2041
01:58:34,950 --> 01:58:37,380
there was not like now
where I got to pace myself,

2042
01:58:37,500 --> 01:58:41,650
pick my battles back then it was no,
every fucking battle I'm in. Yeah,

2043
01:58:41,651 --> 01:58:42,430
and somewhere

2044
01:58:42,430 --> 01:58:45,040
along the line I think
as a standup comedian,

2045
01:58:45,070 --> 01:58:48,880
you forget that this
was a terrifying time.

2046
01:58:48,910 --> 01:58:50,950
Like those times that you
talked about were terrifying,

2047
01:58:51,310 --> 01:58:56,170
but might've been the most exciting
moments of your life, you know?

2048
01:58:56,200 --> 01:58:59,830
I mean the, the, the first couple
of sets that you do that are good,

2049
01:58:59,980 --> 01:59:03,250
that feeling when you're like, holy
fucking shit. I think I'm onto something.

2050
01:59:03,480 --> 01:59:04,630
And then you become obsessed.

2051
01:59:04,631 --> 01:59:08,190
Did you want to write things down
everywhere you go? Because yeah,

2052
01:59:08,390 --> 01:59:13,390
I went to college and to me it was like
I was told what to do and how to thank

2053
01:59:13,521 --> 01:59:17,780
for four years there were tests on a set
of information I was supposed to learn

2054
01:59:17,810 --> 01:59:19,610
and internalize and believe.

2055
01:59:20,240 --> 01:59:25,160
Then you're going to stand out and it's
a blank slate. It's what do you think?

2056
01:59:25,170 --> 01:59:27,560
Would you believe when you make that work?

2057
01:59:27,561 --> 01:59:32,390
And all of a sudden I felt in a way like
that made me grow up in six months more

2058
01:59:32,391 --> 01:59:36,770
than I did in four years in college
because it was all my creation.

2059
01:59:37,370 --> 01:59:41,510
Yeah. Yeah. Well that's one of the most
important things about, uh, you know,

2060
01:59:41,540 --> 01:59:45,110
really finding yourself as putting
something down and been able to look at it

2061
01:59:45,111 --> 01:59:49,940
and go, I fucking, I got that. I did dad.
I got, this is an actual thing that I did.

2062
01:59:50,360 --> 01:59:55,040
Like, here it is, it's put, I put it down
and then you can move on from it. So easy.

2063
01:59:55,100 --> 01:59:57,410
So much more easy. You
get more momentum. Yeah.

2064
01:59:57,890 --> 02:00:01,130
Did you ever read the war of Art Steven
Pressfield Book? What's it called?

2065
02:00:01,160 --> 02:00:05,380
The war of art now you told me about
that, dude. I've got a copy for you. Yeah.

2066
02:00:05,400 --> 02:00:06,200
Yeah.
Brian,

2067
02:00:06,200 --> 02:00:07,520
by the way,
I want to on the air.

2068
02:00:07,560 --> 02:00:11,870
Thank Joe Rogan for one of the best
gifts I've gotten in the last fucking 10

2069
02:00:11,871 --> 02:00:15,740
years. Uh, a beautiful, I'm
going to mispronounce the name,

2070
02:00:15,800 --> 02:00:20,450
aerial Carmeli Aerial Carmeli
pool cue. And I am a, I am a pool,

2071
02:00:20,590 --> 02:00:24,440
just an addict my whole life. And uh,
I've, I haven't had a pool cue and about

2072
02:00:25,370 --> 02:00:28,700
15 years.
So under that shelf down there,

2073
02:00:28,910 --> 02:00:30,770
there's two books to see him.

2074
02:00:32,090 --> 02:00:36,350
It's the war of art during the
corner. Can you reach it and no, no.

2075
02:00:36,440 --> 02:00:40,940
You Yoga doing bitch. All right. I'll
find it. I'll give it to you after a show.

2076
02:00:40,941 --> 02:00:44,330
Remind me there. It's there. Right there.
He just can't reach over. He's impossible.

2077
02:00:45,380 --> 02:00:47,750
It was a cop down the Canyon de Chelly.
Oh yeah.

2078
02:00:47,751 --> 02:00:49,760
He would already be talking
that who'd already, we

2079
02:00:52,280 --> 02:00:55,730
know Brian. It's okay. Don't get it.
It's no, no, no, no. It's no big deal.

2080
02:00:56,850 --> 02:01:01,400
It's the most passive aggressive thing.
Yeah. Shit from the other side. Right.

2081
02:01:01,430 --> 02:01:03,650
All right man. Just leave it there.
Yeah, don't worry about it man.

2082
02:01:04,030 --> 02:01:06,830
I totally cool with it. I'm
really happy with it. No big deal

2083
02:01:10,250 --> 02:01:13,370
right next to you. No, no, no.
There you go. That's the book.

2084
02:01:13,670 --> 02:01:16,940
I bought a bunch of copies just to give
it to me like it's got dust all over it.

2085
02:01:16,950 --> 02:01:17,783
Yep.

2086
02:01:18,070 --> 02:01:21,190
I love it. Break through the blocks
and when your inner creative battle,

2087
02:01:21,410 --> 02:01:22,570
fuck yeah.

2088
02:01:22,690 --> 02:01:24,400
It's a great book. All right. I love it.

2089
02:01:24,401 --> 02:01:29,401
It's a great book for like creativity
and I'm sort of getting past the

2090
02:01:30,401 --> 02:01:35,290
roadblocks of, um, procrastination.
Oh fuck. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2091
02:01:35,291 --> 02:01:38,170
Somebody showed me, this one's been
very interesting work. The guy stuff you

2092
02:01:38,170 --> 02:01:40,070
kind of read and then on each thing.

2093
02:01:40,260 --> 02:01:41,850
Yeah. Well, you know, it's an ethic.

2094
02:01:41,851 --> 02:01:44,700
The guy provides an ethic and he's
got a new one called turning pro,

2095
02:01:44,701 --> 02:01:48,300
which is just as good. I just got into
that. But he's a very inspirational dude.

2096
02:01:48,630 --> 02:01:51,930
You know, I, uh, I love hearing
about dudes who work really hard.

2097
02:01:52,080 --> 02:01:55,440
I don't like hearing about guys who
would come crazy and become obsessed and

2098
02:01:55,441 --> 02:01:57,120
become unhealthy,
like they work too much.

2099
02:01:57,390 --> 02:01:59,880
But I like hearing about dudes
who have like a great work ethic.

2100
02:01:59,910 --> 02:02:00,630
Like could always,

2101
02:02:00,630 --> 02:02:03,750
like whenever I hear about Louis C
K putting out a new hour every year,

2102
02:02:03,930 --> 02:02:07,170
I always like, I love hearing
that. That's inspirational to me.

2103
02:02:07,171 --> 02:02:11,170
I felt like I get like some energy out
of that. Like, Ooh, look this palsy.

2104
02:02:11,950 --> 02:02:16,020
Um, it's too much for me. It
turned out I did a, I did mine.

2105
02:02:16,021 --> 02:02:20,160
Then I did another one in the little
less than two years and that's why I was

2106
02:02:20,161 --> 02:02:22,050
doing like a lot of the UFC stuff as well.

2107
02:02:22,080 --> 02:02:26,520
I do less UFC stuff now than I did before,
so it was while I was doing that,

2108
02:02:26,760 --> 02:02:31,110
but I still feel like I like to
have a bit around for awhile,

2109
02:02:31,380 --> 02:02:32,580
like a year or some stuff.

2110
02:02:32,790 --> 02:02:34,680
Bets are fucking thick too.
I mean,

2111
02:02:34,681 --> 02:02:38,100
it's not like you write a free standing
joke and have to write another,

2112
02:02:38,220 --> 02:02:38,611
I mean you,

2113
02:02:38,611 --> 02:02:43,540
you find something and you explore it
and you extend it and then by the end you

2114
02:02:43,541 --> 02:02:47,100
got to chunk. That's 10 minutes. So
you string together six of those.

2115
02:02:47,101 --> 02:02:47,934
You've got an hour

2116
02:02:48,000 --> 02:02:51,540
and I, I, you know, I know there's
like more life to shit sometimes,

2117
02:02:51,541 --> 02:02:55,130
but it's like I put some stuff on a
special before and then right after it's,

2118
02:02:55,131 --> 02:02:59,250
and you're like, oh, you motherfucker,
the punch line of punchline comes out,

2119
02:02:59,610 --> 02:03:01,490
you know, the tag line, it
changes the whole thing.

2120
02:03:01,700 --> 02:03:05,810
Dana Gould's just gave me a tagline that
took a bit that was already killing and

2121
02:03:05,990 --> 02:03:10,610
doubled. It really, I get this bit about
how we, uh, waste water in this country.

2122
02:03:10,611 --> 02:03:13,670
How we just have fun with it. It's
like a joke. We Have Waterpark,

2123
02:03:13,760 --> 02:03:16,520
we have fountains which just
shoot water in the air. Like,

2124
02:03:16,550 --> 02:03:19,550
fuck you look at all this water.
And then Dana's tagline was,

2125
02:03:19,551 --> 02:03:20,271
and then what do we do?

2126
02:03:20,271 --> 02:03:25,271
We take money we don't need and we throw
it in the fountain and on top of always

2127
02:03:25,281 --> 02:03:28,310
killing that tagline,
just like instant applause,

2128
02:03:28,390 --> 02:03:32,780
right? So true. That's a
perfect like description of, uh,

2129
02:03:32,810 --> 02:03:36,870
like ridiculous opulence.
Giant fountain. Well,

2130
02:03:37,070 --> 02:03:40,290
see what you could dip in and dip
your feet in. Sit in front talk.

2131
02:03:40,600 --> 02:03:43,580
It's like a kid with a pot in his
lap and it's, it's like he's pissing,

2132
02:03:43,581 --> 02:03:44,890
you ever see those pissing out of it?

2133
02:03:45,030 --> 02:03:49,140
I saw a house in Montecito once, you
know Santa Barbara? Yeah. That was,

2134
02:03:49,980 --> 02:03:53,460
these people had like, they must
have owned a museum or some shit,

2135
02:03:53,700 --> 02:03:55,860
but they had a fountain that was so big.

2136
02:03:55,861 --> 02:04:00,090
They converted it into a
swimming pool was fucking huge.

2137
02:04:00,120 --> 02:04:03,840
This huge gorgeous fountain
was a swimming pool.

2138
02:04:04,140 --> 02:04:06,430
These people have like
three fountains as houses,

2139
02:04:06,480 --> 02:04:09,990
ridiculous like that Monosito
area of Santa Barbara.

2140
02:04:10,020 --> 02:04:12,420
It's like some of the most gorgeous
houses like you've ever seen. You're like,

2141
02:04:12,440 --> 02:04:14,730
Oh hell yeah.
Perfect weather all year round.

2142
02:04:14,731 --> 02:04:17,520
They're looking over the ocean and
you're like, Holy Shit. Anytime

2143
02:04:17,530 --> 02:04:20,380
I'm in that part of the world,
you go down below San Francisco,

2144
02:04:20,381 --> 02:04:22,060
they got to think all
the seven mile drive,

2145
02:04:22,061 --> 02:04:25,360
which is where like Pebble Beach Golf
Club is and I really do think that there

2146
02:04:25,361 --> 02:04:28,060
is not a more beautiful place. I
mean, I haven't been to like Tuscany.

2147
02:04:28,061 --> 02:04:28,900
I'm sure there's places,

2148
02:04:29,140 --> 02:04:33,760
but I feel like you can actually afford
to live in a place along the code,

2149
02:04:33,761 --> 02:04:38,040
the Jag, California coast where the
weather is fucking perfect. All the, it's

2150
02:04:38,040 --> 02:04:42,450
just peaceful people and I sort
of feel like, why not do that?

2151
02:04:42,451 --> 02:04:43,530
Teach school

2152
02:04:43,780 --> 02:04:46,180
each school, what would he do?
And living in a fucking movie.

2153
02:04:46,200 --> 02:04:49,510
We're going to learn how to bake bread.
Yeah, I lost it. They're faking shots are,

2154
02:04:50,070 --> 02:04:53,490
that's crazy.
There are some places like Carmel,

2155
02:04:53,520 --> 02:04:56,520
like you ever been to word those were
Clint Eastwood was the male is right below

2156
02:04:56,521 --> 02:04:58,590
where I'm talking about. Oh is
it right below that? Right there.

2157
02:04:58,610 --> 02:05:01,760
So fucking beautiful. It's so
beautiful. You get hot, cold

2158
02:05:02,110 --> 02:05:05,980
town. It's all like art galleries
and cafes that are fucking, you know,

2159
02:05:05,981 --> 02:05:08,140
international and it's bad.
I mean,

2160
02:05:08,141 --> 02:05:12,070
but it's one of those things where hope
you like white people cause that's all

2161
02:05:12,071 --> 02:05:13,750
we got here.
Rich white people.

2162
02:05:13,820 --> 02:05:17,990
Yeah. That's a real white town, right?
Old White people. That's all public. Yeah.

2163
02:05:19,430 --> 02:05:22,770
Yeah. He said some crazy
shit at the Republican. Oh,

2164
02:05:22,771 --> 02:05:25,100
he's losing his marbles for sure.
Right.

2165
02:05:25,480 --> 02:05:28,740
Hey. Well it's like, it's tough
because those John Wayne type guys,

2166
02:05:28,920 --> 02:05:32,850
they come from an era where you know men
were manly and it was simple and it was

2167
02:05:32,851 --> 02:05:36,140
black and white and it's just a
different world now and you try to, you,

2168
02:05:36,240 --> 02:05:39,570
you can't shake clinics was
not going to not be that guy.

2169
02:05:39,600 --> 02:05:43,860
But the times dictated different,
more layered approach to things.

2170
02:05:43,970 --> 02:05:48,970
I think he's missing a substantial amount
of what he used to have as a young man

2171
02:05:50,420 --> 02:05:53,960
as far as his intuition on
how to do things correctly.

2172
02:05:54,650 --> 02:05:59,030
He just doesn't seem, he
didn't seem there. It seemed
like a big struggle to me.

2173
02:05:59,031 --> 02:06:04,031
That whole thing where he's bringing in
John Voight how much on my shelf it was.

2174
02:06:04,611 --> 02:06:06,310
There was something weird
about it. You know, the,

2175
02:06:06,320 --> 02:06:10,700
just all the crazy talk about him being
a conservative and it'll conservatives

2176
02:06:10,701 --> 02:06:13,880
and we just try to, you know,
play our cards closer to our vest.

2177
02:06:13,881 --> 02:06:16,430
Like what are you getting wrapped up with?
Are you,

2178
02:06:16,431 --> 02:06:18,290
do you really believe this narrative?

2179
02:06:18,320 --> 02:06:21,620
Do you really believe this or are you
actually paying attention to what you're

2180
02:06:21,621 --> 02:06:24,290
supporting by being there,
pretending to talk to a chair.

2181
02:06:24,590 --> 02:06:26,060
Like if you talk to the
president like that,

2182
02:06:26,061 --> 02:06:28,610
he should have beat the fuck out of here.
He should box your ears.

2183
02:06:28,760 --> 02:06:31,560
Who the fuck are you to talk to
the president like that credibly,

2184
02:06:32,050 --> 02:06:34,570
that whole fucking
thing was just negating.

2185
02:06:34,630 --> 02:06:37,330
None of it was putting
out here's our real,

2186
02:06:37,390 --> 02:06:41,110
here's our plan for the
economic recovery specifically.

2187
02:06:41,170 --> 02:06:44,110
All it was was tax cuts and more shit.

2188
02:06:44,111 --> 02:06:47,800
We're going to give you stuff that adds
up to negative and yet they're selling

2189
02:06:47,801 --> 02:06:51,760
it by by basically dismantling
what already existed.

2190
02:06:51,761 --> 02:06:56,290
Like everything was a negation.
There was no positive energy about it.

2191
02:06:57,050 --> 02:06:57,381
Yeah.

2192
02:06:57,381 --> 02:07:01,640
It's a weird thing to watch this all play
out to watch this Mitt Romney guy and

2193
02:07:01,970 --> 02:07:06,080
to see this, this whole situation.
It's really weird. It's weird.

2194
02:07:06,081 --> 02:07:07,610
It's weird to watch it play out man.

2195
02:07:08,050 --> 02:07:11,240
As Paul Ryan Dude has already been
busted line on all sorts of shit.

2196
02:07:11,450 --> 02:07:15,100
He said he ran a marathon in
less than three hours. Yup.

2197
02:07:15,230 --> 02:07:16,650
That's like world class.

2198
02:07:16,730 --> 02:07:17,331
They could they,

2199
02:07:17,331 --> 02:07:22,331
they timed it and it was four hours over
four hours over an hour in New Yorker

2200
02:07:22,760 --> 02:07:27,460
did this piece last month about this guy
who was a serial marathon liar and he

2201
02:07:27,470 --> 02:07:31,040
had a website about raising money for
kids with fucking down syndrome and

2202
02:07:31,041 --> 02:07:31,421
support them.

2203
02:07:31,421 --> 02:07:35,230
This guy has a dentist in a small town
in Michigan who everybody loves and he's

2204
02:07:35,231 --> 02:07:38,320
got this whole reputation about being
this marathon runner who's going to run in

2205
02:07:38,321 --> 02:07:43,270
all 48 states in, in the
continental us, and he's going to,

2206
02:07:43,300 --> 02:07:46,810
he's going to do a marathon and each one
is going to post this. His results, well,

2207
02:07:47,170 --> 02:07:50,470
they're starting to be a couple
questions about that. He hadn't, they,

2208
02:07:50,600 --> 02:07:52,870
there was no pictures of him
in the middle of certain races.

2209
02:07:53,650 --> 02:07:58,650
There is a fearsome marathon contingent
that that tracks every single marathon.

2210
02:07:59,950 --> 02:08:02,200
One of the things I have is
these chips and you have to,

2211
02:08:02,320 --> 02:08:07,150
you have to hit I think three chips during
the race to to prevent the rosy ruins

2212
02:08:07,151 --> 02:08:09,190
thing for someone jumping in a car.

2213
02:08:10,390 --> 02:08:12,190
So they went back and
they looked at the chips.

2214
02:08:12,191 --> 02:08:14,470
He fucking hit all of
his chips in everyone.

2215
02:08:14,530 --> 02:08:17,110
But then there's pictures of
them in different outfits.

2216
02:08:17,920 --> 02:08:20,740
There's races where there's no pictures.
There was one race.

2217
02:08:20,770 --> 02:08:24,580
He actually made up what?
He just made up a range. No,

2218
02:08:24,590 --> 02:08:28,990
but he posted that he wanted to have
a San Jose Marathon. Nobody responded.

2219
02:08:29,230 --> 02:08:33,610
So, so he posted 10 with 10 people
that finish in a certain time,

2220
02:08:33,730 --> 02:08:37,200
made up the names, put them on the
website and had him as the winner. Oh,

2221
02:08:37,210 --> 02:08:39,190
that's hilarious. So He's, so anyway,

2222
02:08:39,191 --> 02:08:41,740
they unraveled it and it
was just more like it was,

2223
02:08:41,860 --> 02:08:44,950
the piece was just about
how people can get,

2224
02:08:45,520 --> 02:08:49,960
what is it called when you lie and you
have no, you have no guilt about it. Um,

2225
02:08:50,440 --> 02:08:54,250
sociopath, sociopath, like this
is a sociopath about marathons.

2226
02:08:54,251 --> 02:08:57,580
Everything else in his life was
totally fucking straight up. Good guy.

2227
02:08:57,700 --> 02:08:58,540
Except this crazy man.

2228
02:08:58,810 --> 02:09:03,810
And so the point being there was a very
clear record with Paul Ryan of how La,

2229
02:09:04,540 --> 02:09:06,760
there's no discrepancy.
There's no, you know,

2230
02:09:06,790 --> 02:09:09,520
he absolutely ran it in four
hours and 10 minutes to set it.

2231
02:09:09,540 --> 02:09:13,060
Still Pretty fucking good.
Really? They say that's average.

2232
02:09:13,810 --> 02:09:16,510
I think that's pretty good for
a guy that looks like that.

2233
02:09:17,470 --> 02:09:19,990
It's like an 11 minute
mile. Amazing. Didn't quit.

2234
02:09:21,340 --> 02:09:24,820
Quit all the marathon.
Amazing. Made it through. Yeah.

2235
02:09:25,840 --> 02:09:29,740
It's a hard thing to do. My
amazement, anybody runs 26 miles.

2236
02:09:30,490 --> 02:09:33,400
But why lie about the time when four
hours on still pretty fucking good.

2237
02:09:33,580 --> 02:09:35,470
He's trying to pretend like
he's like a super athlete.

2238
02:09:35,580 --> 02:09:38,490
Well that's the problem is
that if he lies about that,

2239
02:09:38,600 --> 02:09:42,720
tell me it's a character thing,
period. What if he's lying about that?

2240
02:09:42,721 --> 02:09:46,800
What else is going to lie
about his numbers for the
economy are a fucking joke.

2241
02:09:46,801 --> 02:09:51,801
They'd been debunked by
bipartisan committees in
Congress because he introduced

2242
02:09:52,081 --> 02:09:55,800
this whole new economic recovery plan
and it was looked at and they said,

2243
02:09:55,980 --> 02:09:58,710
this is horse shit.
This does not add up.

2244
02:09:58,830 --> 02:10:03,360
But he had every Republican lined up
because he was the new hot shit in in

2245
02:10:03,361 --> 02:10:04,770
Congress when he came in as a junior

2246
02:10:04,850 --> 02:10:08,980
senator. What is his strategy or his
philosophy that he's going to do?

2247
02:10:08,981 --> 02:10:10,480
It's different.
What was his idea?

2248
02:10:10,790 --> 02:10:13,820
Well,
it's real and rand this guy,

2249
02:10:13,821 --> 02:10:15,890
so it's pure free market.

2250
02:10:15,920 --> 02:10:19,910
There's no regulations and a you the,
you know the,

2251
02:10:19,940 --> 02:10:24,710
it's letting capitalism basically dictate
everything and it's about getting rid

2252
02:10:24,711 --> 02:10:27,440
of the safety net entirely.
He wants to take apart Medicare.

2253
02:10:27,590 --> 02:10:31,700
He wants the entire new healthcare
program taken, taken away.

2254
02:10:31,701 --> 02:10:34,550
He wants to prioritize social security,

2255
02:10:34,610 --> 02:10:39,470
which again has been shown in study
after study after study is a worst case

2256
02:10:39,471 --> 02:10:39,711
scenario.

2257
02:10:39,711 --> 02:10:44,711
You're taking a fund of money that people
have paid into with a very nominal,

2258
02:10:44,900 --> 02:10:47,750
uh, broker with service fee, you know,

2259
02:10:47,751 --> 02:10:52,070
built into a 0.04% or whatever and you're
saying, okay, everyone grabbed theirs,

2260
02:10:52,190 --> 02:10:56,390
give it to a broker who's
going to take 5% your bloating,

2261
02:10:56,720 --> 02:10:59,390
this one industry because
they've lobbied you. That's all.

2262
02:10:59,391 --> 02:11:00,260
That's all this is about.

2263
02:11:00,320 --> 02:11:04,370
Banks want to be able to get their hands
on this money and crank up commissions

2264
02:11:04,480 --> 02:11:07,460
in, in making the investments for
you. That's all this boils down to.

2265
02:11:07,590 --> 02:11:09,600
Ran into a, due to one
of my shows who, uh,

2266
02:11:09,810 --> 02:11:12,810
is an Iraq war veteran and he went in,

2267
02:11:12,811 --> 02:11:17,730
he actually volunteered for the army
and then right after he volunteered,

2268
02:11:18,200 --> 02:11:20,490
um, I don't remember which
branch I said the army,

2269
02:11:20,700 --> 02:11:22,080
I might be wrong or right after,

2270
02:11:22,081 --> 02:11:24,240
I think it was actually the air
force right after he volunteered,

2271
02:11:24,270 --> 02:11:28,880
nine 11 happened. So right afterwards
he's going to war. And, uh,

2272
02:11:28,890 --> 02:11:32,100
he'd said that one of the first things
that the United States government did was

2273
02:11:32,101 --> 02:11:33,660
they printed Iraqi money,

2274
02:11:34,050 --> 02:11:39,050
just fucking crazy amounts of it and
just flooded the market with fake money.

2275
02:11:39,600 --> 02:11:43,590
And that's how you're crushing economy.
Is that amazing? Like, you know,

2276
02:11:43,610 --> 02:11:45,960
wanted to crush our economy.
They would just make,

2277
02:11:45,990 --> 02:11:49,920
just put millions and millions of dollars
like in the streets and people would

2278
02:11:49,921 --> 02:11:53,040
go crazy and run out and buy Ferrari's,
Ferrari's, it'd be worth nothing.

2279
02:11:53,390 --> 02:11:57,150
Anything that happened here. Do you think
that's a, could it happen here? I, yes.

2280
02:11:57,180 --> 02:11:59,700
Look, the, the, the economy
is not based on anything.

2281
02:11:59,850 --> 02:12:01,590
That's what the idea of a gold standard.

2282
02:12:01,591 --> 02:12:05,400
That's where it's supposed to make some
sense. And the idea though that you're,

2283
02:12:05,401 --> 02:12:08,580
you're going to be able to make something
like a dollar bill that can't be

2284
02:12:08,581 --> 02:12:11,970
reproduced by somebody with
nefarious means. Of course.

2285
02:12:11,971 --> 02:12:14,820
They're going to be able to figure that
out. Man. As technology gets better,

2286
02:12:14,970 --> 02:12:17,550
they're not going to be able to hold off
the, that whole printing press thing.

2287
02:12:17,551 --> 02:12:18,900
People are going to figure
out how to make money.

2288
02:12:19,010 --> 02:12:23,080
To this day, the, uh, I forget what
the Iranian and Iraqi currency is,

2289
02:12:23,090 --> 02:12:25,070
but a DNR I think. Yes, exactly.

2290
02:12:25,130 --> 02:12:29,390
It is the lowest rated
currency on the planet.

2291
02:12:29,480 --> 02:12:32,030
It's like a hundred thousand per $1.

2292
02:12:32,080 --> 02:12:35,110
What do you do then? Do you have to
start from scratch? You have to start.

2293
02:12:35,111 --> 02:12:35,944
The whole civilization

2294
02:12:36,620 --> 02:12:39,440
got to go to the gold standard.
I mean it's,

2295
02:12:39,441 --> 02:12:41,330
you got to find something to tether it to.

2296
02:12:41,480 --> 02:12:44,750
Yeah. And then by then the militaries
in the streets and you're fucked.

2297
02:12:44,790 --> 02:12:45,890
I scramble.

2298
02:12:46,050 --> 02:12:49,620
Yeah. You know what's amazing is
you're talking about Mesopotamia.

2299
02:12:49,621 --> 02:12:54,210
You're talking about the most fertile,
the origins of all civilization.

2300
02:12:54,211 --> 02:12:55,440
And it's a fuck zone.

2301
02:12:55,790 --> 02:12:59,460
It's amazing. Well, I've, I think
they're the townies of the world.

2302
02:13:01,930 --> 02:13:05,080
I think that's what it is.
They just been around too long.

2303
02:13:05,710 --> 02:13:10,490
That's where civilization was invented.
So that, that area, that's the,

2304
02:13:10,540 --> 02:13:10,931
sorry,

2305
02:13:10,931 --> 02:13:15,910
same assholes who developed their
civilization 6,000 years ago.

2306
02:13:15,911 --> 02:13:18,970
They just stayed. Everybody else is
like, these people are fucking crazy.

2307
02:13:18,971 --> 02:13:21,430
They're throwing rocks at people
for dancing. Let's get outta here.

2308
02:13:21,610 --> 02:13:25,210
So every other civilization
branched off from that one part.

2309
02:13:25,900 --> 02:13:29,520
But they stayed and they got, yeah, they
got two story. I got a double decker.

2310
02:13:29,620 --> 02:13:33,580
I'm fucking rent out the upstairs
to my parents. Do you want,

2311
02:13:33,620 --> 02:13:34,770
when you go back to Ohio,

2312
02:13:34,800 --> 02:13:37,650
do you relate to townies or do you think
that Ohio is like a better place to

2313
02:13:37,651 --> 02:13:40,380
live? Did you go back and forth? Boring.

2314
02:13:40,500 --> 02:13:44,580
But I mean if I could have
a humongous house, you know,

2315
02:13:44,650 --> 02:13:48,780
and people live great there.
Everyone has, my sister has two kids,

2316
02:13:49,110 --> 02:13:52,440
works as a hairstylist,
but she has a huge house and a huge yard.

2317
02:13:52,441 --> 02:13:55,470
So it just seems, it's weird.
It's easier and more comfortable.

2318
02:13:55,471 --> 02:13:57,870
It's not as stressful.
It's not,

2319
02:13:58,050 --> 02:14:01,560
it's weird how much variation there is
and areas where you could buy a house

2320
02:14:02,310 --> 02:14:06,590
variation. The money, like who
she, you know, I'm so white
you can get, and you know,

2321
02:14:06,750 --> 02:14:10,740
another thing was is like when you walk
to your car at night and when you do

2322
02:14:10,741 --> 02:14:14,640
certain things,
you automatically feel safe out there.

2323
02:14:14,641 --> 02:14:18,480
Like you could just sit there and just
have money in your both of your hands and

2324
02:14:18,481 --> 02:14:22,770
walk to your car after going to a movie.
And no one would give a shit dude,

2325
02:14:22,950 --> 02:14:26,400
from that video that you made,
that dude who went to the 100 best videos,

2326
02:14:26,401 --> 02:14:30,540
by the way, the Heckler, the drunk heckler
and Columbus. Oh yeah. Remember that one?

2327
02:14:30,570 --> 02:14:30,860
Yeah,

2328
02:14:30,860 --> 02:14:33,560
dude, that was first of all,
that was a awesome video.

2329
02:14:33,561 --> 02:14:36,200
You may cause you the way you
edit it was so funny. It was just,

2330
02:14:36,470 --> 02:14:38,450
the dude was so ridiculous.

2331
02:14:38,540 --> 02:14:43,160
But we missed the best part of the story
because this guy who had his shirt off

2332
02:14:43,161 --> 02:14:46,100
and my comedy show screaming,
yelling. Yeah. Yeah.

2333
02:14:46,101 --> 02:14:47,570
I came off stage and I hugged him.

2334
02:14:47,571 --> 02:14:50,600
It was like the most ridiculous shit of
all time. He was just like so hammered.

2335
02:14:50,601 --> 02:14:53,240
He was so crazy.
We ran into him at the end of the night,

2336
02:14:53,480 --> 02:14:56,240
face covered in blood shirt lists.

2337
02:14:56,390 --> 02:14:59,000
Just somebody beat the
fuck out of this guy.

2338
02:14:59,330 --> 02:15:02,000
And I looked at him and I
looked at them on, sorry dude.

2339
02:15:02,240 --> 02:15:05,280
Yeah, but we didn't, we didn't
fuck it filled that need to know.

2340
02:15:05,300 --> 02:15:10,110
No one had anything on. So we were like,
Shit. Yeah, I saw this dude. I was in. Um,

2341
02:15:11,840 --> 02:15:15,530
and Jose, if you do that fucking club
in San Jose, the Improv. Oh yeah.

2342
02:15:15,560 --> 02:15:19,480
Fucking amazing. I'm supposed to
do it sometime soon, but the, the,

2343
02:15:19,481 --> 02:15:22,000
the show got moved.
It was a for,

2344
02:15:22,010 --> 02:15:24,630
I was going to do the
Friday night before UFC.

2345
02:15:25,070 --> 02:15:28,320
Places like a 500 year
old ancient theater,

2346
02:15:28,660 --> 02:15:32,120
three Charlie Chaplin perform
their cheese and acoustics.

2347
02:15:32,121 --> 02:15:34,640
You don't even for 500 years old.
I'm just making shit up.

2348
02:15:34,960 --> 02:15:37,370
There weren't people in California
five and years ago. Stupid.

2349
02:15:38,150 --> 02:15:40,760
What would the ass tax doing? A
standup show. Isn't that weird?

2350
02:15:40,761 --> 02:15:42,770
That just 500 years ago
there was no people.

2351
02:15:43,190 --> 02:15:45,560
And you've got to Europe and
you'd like to talk about Iraq.

2352
02:15:45,600 --> 02:15:47,840
It's like they got a history.
Yeah,

2353
02:15:47,841 --> 02:15:51,680
that's San Jose Improv is one of the
most beautiful interiors, like the,

2354
02:15:51,681 --> 02:15:55,090
the inside and the feel of
it. Like it feels like, uh,

2355
02:15:55,310 --> 02:15:57,560
like a seasoned performance room,

2356
02:15:58,090 --> 02:16:01,940
well worn room and the guy that runs a
jam is fucking treated me great. Anyway,

2357
02:16:01,941 --> 02:16:06,920
professional bowler. Yes.
Bad mother fucker. He was a
Vietnam vet too. Good too.

2358
02:16:07,760 --> 02:16:11,210
He a, he goes bowling and just
fucks people up apparently.

2359
02:16:11,240 --> 02:16:15,470
Apparently he's like legit worldclass
bowler and he'll go to Vegas and people

2360
02:16:15,471 --> 02:16:18,440
gamble in Vegas, you know, they get
crazy. They're out there on vacation.

2361
02:16:18,441 --> 02:16:20,000
Well it's called ball a few frames.

2362
02:16:20,180 --> 02:16:23,720
They start talking shit and you know he
comes over and he knows how to him until

2363
02:16:23,721 --> 02:16:24,980
he knows how to play their ego.

2364
02:16:24,981 --> 02:16:29,170
And he starts getting involved in a big
gambling with some knuckleheads and he's

2365
02:16:29,171 --> 02:16:30,040
come back with like

2366
02:16:30,040 --> 02:16:33,790
sick money from gambling in Vegas.
Yeah. And he's such as fucking

2367
02:16:34,080 --> 02:16:38,820
cool guy. Just unabashedly
the real deal. Cool.

2368
02:16:38,821 --> 02:16:42,090
Just a cool guy. Yeah, he's a,
and you know he got fuck man.

2369
02:16:42,091 --> 02:16:45,090
He went to Vietnam three and a half years,
came back,

2370
02:16:45,120 --> 02:16:48,660
did his 21 years in the navy
and now he's like, yeah,

2371
02:16:48,690 --> 02:16:52,620
I get 120 bucks a month and
fucking benefit. He goes,

2372
02:16:52,621 --> 02:16:57,040
they cut all the benefits that you're
promised and including like going to the

2373
02:16:57,040 --> 02:17:01,410
Va hospital and get, get your glasses,
dental, all that. Shit's gone to do that.

2374
02:17:01,620 --> 02:17:04,260
That's my, what the fuck.
You get pro, you go to war,

2375
02:17:04,380 --> 02:17:06,930
you put your life on the
line for the country.

2376
02:17:07,170 --> 02:17:10,080
You are fucking taken care of period.

2377
02:17:10,081 --> 02:17:12,540
That that is the biggest
travesty happening right now.

2378
02:17:13,470 --> 02:17:18,310
Some UFC fights, we did it for the, some
institute for traumatic brain injury,

2379
02:17:18,311 --> 02:17:19,930
I believe it's called and it was there.

2380
02:17:19,960 --> 02:17:22,780
They're building some huge thing
so they had to raise money for it.

2381
02:17:23,050 --> 02:17:25,180
So the UFC fights raised
a lot of money for it.

2382
02:17:25,181 --> 02:17:29,260
But one of the things I was thinking of
was how crazy is it that there's these

2383
02:17:29,260 --> 02:17:31,990
billion dollar deals that these people
like Halliburton and these companies

2384
02:17:31,991 --> 02:17:35,800
around there like Halliburton get
billion dollar deals in in it somehow or

2385
02:17:35,801 --> 02:17:40,030
another is not the money
for these rehabilitation
centers. Like that's insane.

2386
02:17:40,180 --> 02:17:45,040
The fact that they can profit off the war
and not be giving anything back in the

2387
02:17:45,041 --> 02:17:49,240
form of some,
at least you know,

2388
02:17:49,241 --> 02:17:52,510
do what what a charity is doing.
At least do that.

2389
02:17:52,511 --> 02:17:54,960
I mean you're profiting from
the charities just stepping in.

2390
02:17:55,040 --> 02:17:59,570
That's exactly why it's privatized because
the u s government allows itself to

2391
02:17:59,571 --> 02:18:04,340
be buffered from number one.
If there's a rape overseas eat,

2392
02:18:04,341 --> 02:18:07,520
doesn't it? It does not get
processed in US courts. They've got,

2393
02:18:07,550 --> 02:18:09,680
they've got all illegal
people work in the jobs,

2394
02:18:09,681 --> 02:18:11,480
they tit tell these
girls in the Philippines,

2395
02:18:11,780 --> 02:18:14,420
the Halliburton does through
another agency that they get it,

2396
02:18:14,450 --> 02:18:17,270
they're going to get a job
doing hairstyling and they're
going to make 40 grand

2397
02:18:17,271 --> 02:18:21,140
a year. They take them off and they're
working at fucking burger king in the mid,

2398
02:18:21,200 --> 02:18:25,790
in the Mideast sleeping in fucking
tankers and paying off the money.

2399
02:18:25,791 --> 02:18:30,320
They had to pay to get over there for
like five or six years before they make a

2400
02:18:30,321 --> 02:18:34,210
dollar and slavery. Yeah. It's
fucking slavery, slavery word.

2401
02:18:34,240 --> 02:18:38,100
They'd just, they have it written down
somewhere. So it's like okay to do. Yup.

2402
02:18:38,101 --> 02:18:38,934
Somehow or another,

2403
02:18:39,080 --> 02:18:42,430
cause it's not the US government because
the US government is sub contracting to

2404
02:18:42,431 --> 02:18:45,100
Halliburton so that you
know, any kind of, uh,

2405
02:18:45,160 --> 02:18:48,550
any kind of lawsuits that come in,

2406
02:18:48,790 --> 02:18:51,250
don't they don't touch the u s government.
And so they,

2407
02:18:51,251 --> 02:18:54,500
so they're not paying out to the soldiers
because they have no real relationship.

2408
02:18:55,320 --> 02:18:58,300
You slavery without chains, just
make it so they can't leave. Yes.

2409
02:18:58,380 --> 02:19:01,620
May mean you might lose one or two every
now and then, but you can get them back.

2410
02:19:01,621 --> 02:19:06,360
You can get different ones and it's
a terrifying sort of a situation.

2411
02:19:06,361 --> 02:19:09,960
But that's like a lot of what's going on
apparently in parts of the Middle East

2412
02:19:10,320 --> 02:19:14,790
in like Dubai or did that gone on
and some uh, construction sites,

2413
02:19:14,880 --> 02:19:17,670
I think didn't vice do
a special on that Brian?

2414
02:19:17,800 --> 02:19:22,230
I don't know. Yeah, they said if he buys
things do by, brings in people from, um,

2415
02:19:22,330 --> 02:19:24,400
I don't know.
I can't remember what country it is,

2416
02:19:24,401 --> 02:19:27,160
but they bring them in on these,
they're not even,

2417
02:19:27,440 --> 02:19:32,240
they're like work visas that are like
a week long and the second you're done

2418
02:19:32,241 --> 02:19:36,500
with your work, you're gone. It
just, you don't earn your way in.

2419
02:19:36,501 --> 02:19:38,240
And so that's something like,
you know,

2420
02:19:38,241 --> 02:19:41,540
three quarters of the work force is not
from that country and they just have

2421
02:19:41,541 --> 02:19:44,540
these sprawling fucking
camps that people live in.

2422
02:19:44,541 --> 02:19:47,210
And then they kicked him out
as soon as now instantly. No,

2423
02:19:47,330 --> 02:19:50,960
no coverage in accidents whatsoever.
It's barbaric.

2424
02:19:51,490 --> 02:19:55,360
It's fucked up too, because again, we're
talking about the townies of the world.

2425
02:19:55,600 --> 02:19:59,530
So they really still are rocking it the
same way they did a thousand years ago

2426
02:19:59,531 --> 02:20:02,530
or several thousand years ago. There
really are rocking it like that. Yeah,

2427
02:20:02,540 --> 02:20:05,890
just rocking it like that. Behind the
rules. I mean, they really do steel,

2428
02:20:05,891 --> 02:20:10,330
it's still have kings and uh,
there was some piece on, on, on um,

2429
02:20:10,990 --> 02:20:15,880
that dude, um, who, uh, we had
Brian on the podcast the other day,

2430
02:20:15,910 --> 02:20:19,560
David Seaman, he had something that's
his real name, powerful dude though.

2431
02:20:19,960 --> 02:20:22,700
He's a great guy. That
is his real name. Um,

2432
02:20:22,780 --> 02:20:26,140
and there was something that
he had on his Twitter page.

2433
02:20:26,141 --> 02:20:31,141
It showed how CNN had some stories about
the Arab spring uprising in Bahrain and

2434
02:20:33,941 --> 02:20:37,510
they decided not to aerate and uh,

2435
02:20:37,570 --> 02:20:42,160
apparently about rain is fucked up and
people start to make youtube videos of it

2436
02:20:42,370 --> 02:20:45,370
and put them online because there's
not enough interest in, you know,

2437
02:20:45,371 --> 02:20:49,210
there's so many, everyone's aware of Saudi
Arabia, everyone's aware of, you know,

2438
02:20:49,211 --> 02:20:52,000
what's happening in Egypt.
Everyone's aware of Libya,

2439
02:20:52,030 --> 02:20:53,860
but a lot of people are
not aware about rain,

2440
02:20:53,861 --> 02:20:55,780
so they're still trying to
keep this one locked down.

2441
02:20:55,781 --> 02:20:59,370
And while everything else is going on,
but there's some horrific fucking foot.

2442
02:20:59,371 --> 02:20:59,680
Yeah,

2443
02:20:59,680 --> 02:21:01,640
and it's just government controlled media.
Yeah,

2444
02:21:01,700 --> 02:21:05,630
man. They're gunning people down
there trying to stop a civil uprising.

2445
02:21:06,320 --> 02:21:08,750
It's horrific stuff, man. Horrific stuff.

2446
02:21:08,751 --> 02:21:11,220
And there's really graphic
videos available on,

2447
02:21:11,530 --> 02:21:14,200
and our interest in the average
spring ended about a year ago.

2448
02:21:14,201 --> 02:21:16,510
People don't even know what's
going on is worse than any of it.

2449
02:21:16,511 --> 02:21:19,510
And people aren't even fucking
tracking that because it's like we, ah,

2450
02:21:19,520 --> 02:21:22,600
we already had Egypt, we already
had Libya. Where we've got our Phil,

2451
02:21:22,870 --> 02:21:26,170
what people don't understand
is the pocalypse is here.

2452
02:21:26,770 --> 02:21:31,120
It just hasn't reached California with
the apocalypse of you're in Bahrain,

2453
02:21:31,150 --> 02:21:32,200
that's the apocalypse.

2454
02:21:32,440 --> 02:21:36,160
If friends are getting their heads blown
off right next to you by sniper rifles,

2455
02:21:36,460 --> 02:21:40,570
that's the apocalypse. I mean, this is a
civil war. People are dying in the street.

2456
02:21:40,571 --> 02:21:44,890
The government is gunning down
civilians. I mean, it's craziness.

2457
02:21:45,000 --> 02:21:50,000
But what about the places that like Egypt
that now has democratically elected do

2458
02:21:50,701 --> 02:21:54,900
there really, isn't it? The
Muslim Brotherhood, they
were voted in and they're,

2459
02:21:54,980 --> 02:21:58,440
you know what? They're not
as bad as people think as
they say. The sound rather.

2460
02:21:58,441 --> 02:22:00,810
They sound scary. You know what
though? It's one of those things.

2461
02:22:00,811 --> 02:22:04,020
Where are they going to snake it in?
They get an office, everything's cool.

2462
02:22:04,021 --> 02:22:05,610
I'm gets a Turkey at Thanksgiving.

2463
02:22:05,790 --> 02:22:08,190
Two years later the women are
all in fucking potato sacks.

2464
02:22:08,390 --> 02:22:10,910
I wonder how much longer that's going
to work with the Internet with the

2465
02:22:10,911 --> 02:22:12,710
distribution of information
that we have right now.

2466
02:22:12,711 --> 02:22:16,760
It gets harder and harder to convince
kids of nonsense. It's harder and harder.

2467
02:22:16,761 --> 02:22:20,420
It's just not the same sort of animal
that was around when we grew up. Lou,

2468
02:22:20,450 --> 02:22:24,230
when we grew up, you know even if you
didn't believe in God but made no sense,

2469
02:22:24,231 --> 02:22:27,810
you hedge your bet one on one with
everything and you know you believe it is

2470
02:22:27,811 --> 02:22:29,640
real.
I did all that Shit I was supposed to do.

2471
02:22:30,150 --> 02:22:32,340
Even if you don't have a
whole ton of faith in it,

2472
02:22:32,610 --> 02:22:35,310
you don't have the kind of access to
him or we didn't rather have the kind of

2473
02:22:35,311 --> 02:22:36,870
access to information
that kids have today.

2474
02:22:36,990 --> 02:22:39,300
Cause if they have a question about
anything, like why is the sky blue?

2475
02:22:39,330 --> 02:22:43,170
They Google, why is the sky blue? I
mean kids are growing up doing that now.

2476
02:22:43,290 --> 02:22:45,720
So they ever have a car,
you can't just bullshit them.

2477
02:22:45,790 --> 02:22:49,960
Yeah. You're assuming the internet
stays is free as it is now.

2478
02:22:49,961 --> 02:22:52,290
I mean you just by saying Google,
you know,

2479
02:22:52,330 --> 02:22:54,670
so many people get their
information from two portals.

2480
02:22:54,671 --> 02:22:57,250
You've got Wikipedia and Google
and if those are, you know,

2481
02:22:57,251 --> 02:23:00,880
Google is part of a
multinational corporation and
eventually they're going to

2482
02:23:00,881 --> 02:23:04,660
rein it in because of corporate sponsors
are because the same pressure CNN gets

2483
02:23:04,661 --> 02:23:07,900
to not put out stuff about Bahrain.
Any big company is,

2484
02:23:07,901 --> 02:23:11,860
is ultimately going to be effected
by the people that are running it.

2485
02:23:11,960 --> 02:23:15,650
Did you hear that? Some of those
leat hacker dude's hacked into a, uh,

2486
02:23:16,150 --> 02:23:21,150
an FBI laptop and found the names
of a hundred of no 14 million,

2487
02:23:23,750 --> 02:23:26,270
uh,
apple ios users.

2488
02:23:27,140 --> 02:23:28,820
They found the information on them.

2489
02:23:29,270 --> 02:23:33,070
I don't know what station three they
cracked into that database and got all

2490
02:23:33,071 --> 02:23:37,530
those names. It's fucking crazy.
Index box. Well, cause they chair the,

2491
02:23:37,540 --> 02:23:40,630
what's crazy is challenging and
they said you'll never crack.

2492
02:23:40,631 --> 02:23:43,990
That was either playstation,
Xbox that challenged the hackers.

2493
02:23:44,590 --> 02:23:49,470
Basically they can get
through anything. But the, um,

2494
02:23:49,560 --> 02:23:54,140
the, what was scary about it
was that these, you know, this,

2495
02:23:54,170 --> 02:23:58,830
this whole hacker thing like really
wasn't really recognized. Yeah.

2496
02:23:59,580 --> 02:24:04,230
Yeah. I mean when like when you see
like that Guy Kevin Mitnick, you know,

2497
02:24:04,240 --> 02:24:08,910
that guy is, do you know what that guy
is? He was like a really famous hacker.

2498
02:24:09,390 --> 02:24:13,440
He was a guy who at one point in time
they offered him a job eventually at one

2499
02:24:13,441 --> 02:24:17,350
of the big companies who would do like
what's called phone freaking or you um,

2500
02:24:17,580 --> 02:24:21,010
phone freaking you'll like you,
you figure out like how to get, um,

2501
02:24:21,180 --> 02:24:25,380
make calls through like a box that
would send a tone down the line.

2502
02:24:25,650 --> 02:24:28,350
This is like the step one.
It's like the hacking the system.

2503
02:24:28,351 --> 02:24:32,470
It's like back when dial tone
phones came online when diet was,

2504
02:24:32,471 --> 02:24:35,460
see before dial tones. We all remember
when you were really little kid,

2505
02:24:35,461 --> 02:24:39,750
you had to spin that dial, which is
really like alien to people today.

2506
02:24:39,870 --> 02:24:43,990
But when you dial a number you'd go
down a lodge.

2507
02:24:44,070 --> 02:24:48,840
It was ridiculous. And then they
came out with a dial tone situation.

2508
02:24:49,020 --> 02:24:53,280
But what someone realized somewhere along
the line is that there's a computer or

2509
02:24:53,281 --> 02:24:57,540
something interfacing on the other end
that's responding to the tones and those

2510
02:24:57,541 --> 02:24:58,650
tones represent a number.

2511
02:24:58,651 --> 02:25:01,740
So let's find out what those tones
represent and then we could fucking do

2512
02:25:01,741 --> 02:25:06,360
whatever we want. And to have access to
free unlimited long distance calling.

2513
02:25:06,460 --> 02:25:08,880
Because remember back then you
couldn't get long distance.

2514
02:25:08,881 --> 02:25:10,430
Long distance was hard.
Yeah.

2515
02:25:10,431 --> 02:25:13,260
Like if you dated a girl and she lived
in the five Oh eight, you'd be like,

2516
02:25:13,290 --> 02:25:17,610
oh Jesus, she loves way the
fuck over there. It's the
long distance and then any,

2517
02:25:17,611 --> 02:25:21,300
any sort of a state crossing state lines,
long distance.

2518
02:25:21,301 --> 02:25:24,040
That was a long distance call.
Your fucking parents

2519
02:25:24,040 --> 02:25:27,610
would scream with you. You're a long
distance. It could be 10 miles away.

2520
02:25:27,820 --> 02:25:31,990
Remember it used to have held a separate
long distance company to like at and t,

2521
02:25:31,991 --> 02:25:35,340
but I had sprint as my long distance.
Right. Spring can save your money.

2522
02:25:35,560 --> 02:25:36,810
Do you remember when,
um,

2523
02:25:36,820 --> 02:25:40,340
they used to have it for cell phones
were long distance for cell phones.

2524
02:25:40,360 --> 02:25:43,180
It's like super expensive. Crazy.
Do you remember that was crazy.

2525
02:25:43,290 --> 02:25:44,530
He'd use a calling card,

2526
02:25:44,531 --> 02:25:48,820
which meant you had to punch in about
16 numbers before you put in the number

2527
02:25:48,821 --> 02:25:53,320
you are calling. Yes, exactly.
Yeah, I remember that. But this, uh,

2528
02:25:53,321 --> 02:25:54,610
this Kevin Mitnick guy,

2529
02:25:54,880 --> 02:25:57,790
he started out doing that and then
eventually it went to be in some sort of a

2530
02:25:58,210 --> 02:25:59,350
full blown hacker.

2531
02:25:59,440 --> 02:26:03,760
But to go from that to be
able to experience what's
going on right now must be

2532
02:26:03,761 --> 02:26:06,310
like really incredible to witness.

2533
02:26:06,340 --> 02:26:09,880
Well there's a group that
he is actually opposed to,

2534
02:26:09,910 --> 02:26:14,830
there's a group that identifies itself
as the somethings and they are an

2535
02:26:14,831 --> 02:26:18,520
international web of hackers
that get off on doing it.

2536
02:26:18,521 --> 02:26:21,280
And they've done every talking about
low sec, is that what it's called?

2537
02:26:21,340 --> 02:26:25,620
That's one of them. There's a sec. Yeah.

2538
02:26:25,630 --> 02:26:27,610
And he came out against
anonymous because he,

2539
02:26:27,700 --> 02:26:30,820
for him cracking the codes
was about the science.

2540
02:26:30,821 --> 02:26:35,350
It was about the art of doing it. And
these guys are much more into sabotage.

2541
02:26:35,351 --> 02:26:37,600
They have a political
agenda, you know, they,

2542
02:26:37,601 --> 02:26:41,800
they out corporations and they
blackmail them. And so, um, you know,

2543
02:26:41,801 --> 02:26:45,850
the bottom line is you're never going to
get the talent on the payrolls that is

2544
02:26:45,851 --> 02:26:48,910
going to be out there because
they're independent minded people.

2545
02:26:48,911 --> 02:26:51,180
There antiestablishment
people they don't want,

2546
02:26:51,220 --> 02:26:53,110
they don't want to be in a
payroll because they don't,

2547
02:26:53,170 --> 02:26:54,560
they don't wanna be told what to do.
They offer,

2548
02:26:54,561 --> 02:26:58,030
they offer this guy a job and he went to
Microsoft or one of those big companies

2549
02:26:58,031 --> 02:27:00,670
for like six months. They basically
wanted them off the streets.

2550
02:27:00,700 --> 02:27:03,970
They wanted them in house and he
just got bored and he fucking left.

2551
02:27:04,000 --> 02:27:04,900
Well that was the,
the,

2552
02:27:04,901 --> 02:27:09,901
the big issue was that why did the
FBI have these 14 million ios users

2553
02:27:10,931 --> 02:27:14,770
information? Why they have that
on their laptop. That's like what,

2554
02:27:14,771 --> 02:27:19,570
how much to what extent is
spying already going on,

2555
02:27:19,571 --> 02:27:21,400
on almost every American civilian.

2556
02:27:21,670 --> 02:27:24,460
Cause it's probably gotten
pretty fucking crazy now.

2557
02:27:24,490 --> 02:27:27,850
Do you feel like when you're making a
text message that you're sending it to the

2558
02:27:27,851 --> 02:27:31,150
government as well? Eh,
cause I saw my Dick,

2559
02:27:31,151 --> 02:27:34,720
they've seen me talk about
fucking farts a, I mean like what?

2560
02:27:35,100 --> 02:27:37,840
I'm not worried about
anything. I understand that
you're not worried about it,

2561
02:27:37,841 --> 02:27:41,950
but do you understand that giving people
that kind of access to information is

2562
02:27:41,951 --> 02:27:44,140
not, it's not cool. The more they,

2563
02:27:44,380 --> 02:27:49,380
why should we agree that they should be
the ones who are allowed to look at all

2564
02:27:50,291 --> 02:27:53,950
this stuff and be fair at this data?
I think that's ridiculous.

2565
02:27:53,951 --> 02:27:57,910
It's ridiculous to allow someone to be
in that sort of voyeuristic position and

2566
02:27:57,920 --> 02:28:02,830
not, I mean look at look at anonymous
or look at any of these hacking groups.

2567
02:28:03,370 --> 02:28:08,350
They, those files when they had,
when people hacked like playstation.

2568
02:28:08,351 --> 02:28:12,190
It's something that if you were in the
right circles you would be able to have

2569
02:28:12,191 --> 02:28:16,750
that file, you know, and like you can
doubt, what are you trying to say?

2570
02:28:16,810 --> 02:28:19,150
Like it's,
it's if you wanted information,

2571
02:28:19,151 --> 02:28:22,040
like if you want it all this information,
you yourself could get it right

2572
02:28:22,040 --> 02:28:23,120
now if you went online,

2573
02:28:23,450 --> 02:28:28,040
like if you wanted all these peoples
ps three names and numbers are Oh Ios,

2574
02:28:28,041 --> 02:28:30,060
six informations,

2575
02:28:30,170 --> 02:28:33,350
you know the FBI got an online also,

2576
02:28:33,380 --> 02:28:35,420
you know there was what your sites

2577
02:28:35,790 --> 02:28:38,880
download all this information off of
this torrent websites where you can

2578
02:28:38,881 --> 02:28:43,740
download stolen formation. Real
absolute. So what are these websites

2579
02:28:44,230 --> 02:28:48,100
since this FBI like guy,
he could have his job,

2580
02:28:48,101 --> 02:28:51,250
could have been like going to torrent
websites and downloading shit. You know,

2581
02:28:51,251 --> 02:28:54,280
he might have also had beauty and the
beast and three d, You know, on his,

2582
02:28:54,580 --> 02:28:57,430
on his laptop. You know,
who, who knows, who cares?

2583
02:28:57,431 --> 02:29:00,580
I mean like if they're going
to single you out, they,

2584
02:29:00,700 --> 02:29:01,810
they're going to single you out.

2585
02:29:03,000 --> 02:29:05,060
Absolutely appreciate your,
um,

2586
02:29:05,150 --> 02:29:08,600
you're not wanting to get upset at the
experience and like, who gives a fuck?

2587
02:29:08,601 --> 02:29:09,650
I'm not doing anything wrong.

2588
02:29:09,890 --> 02:29:13,670
But the real problem is you give people
too much power and they fucking abuse it.

2589
02:29:14,030 --> 02:29:16,430
And that's why there's
all these psychological,

2590
02:29:16,850 --> 02:29:20,250
like fail safes that are set up
in door system that, you know,

2591
02:29:20,570 --> 02:29:21,970
you're not supposed to
have too much power.

2592
02:29:22,000 --> 02:29:24,110
It's supposed to be like a whole
checks and balances system.

2593
02:29:24,111 --> 02:29:27,170
Make sure that people don't get out
of hand because they do naturally.

2594
02:29:27,380 --> 02:29:29,240
And if someone all of a
sudden can check your phone,

2595
02:29:29,360 --> 02:29:31,850
someone all of a sudden can read
all your emails, they're going to,

2596
02:29:31,990 --> 02:29:32,261
yeah.

2597
02:29:32,261 --> 02:29:35,350
And the bottom line is right now that
seems safe because there's no imminent

2598
02:29:35,470 --> 02:29:35,771
threat,

2599
02:29:35,771 --> 02:29:39,580
but you see a guy like Rick Perry become
president and load up the fucking FBI

2600
02:29:39,581 --> 02:29:41,920
and CIA,
they're going to go,

2601
02:29:42,130 --> 02:29:45,430
we want the Christian values protected
in this country and they're going to

2602
02:29:45,431 --> 02:29:48,310
start going after the guys that put
their dicks online and you're going to be

2603
02:29:48,430 --> 02:29:50,600
fucking, you know, I'm not going
to be rounded up. You're good.

2604
02:29:50,620 --> 02:29:54,610
They're going to on a miss his way more
intelligent than the government and

2605
02:29:55,030 --> 02:29:58,600
they're hackers are way better
than shit will take over.

2606
02:29:59,510 --> 02:30:01,670
Eventually happen.
It's a fascinating idea.

2607
02:30:01,671 --> 02:30:05,540
The idea that the civilization will be
taken over through the inlet and that the

2608
02:30:05,541 --> 02:30:08,720
Internet is because everything is
going to be run through the Internet.

2609
02:30:08,930 --> 02:30:13,640
They would figure out some way of having
a constantly changing code that you can

2610
02:30:13,641 --> 02:30:17,810
never crack and they use it to just
manipulate wealth. And then if you,

2611
02:30:17,811 --> 02:30:20,270
as long as you keep your shit together,
they keep everything running smooth.

2612
02:30:20,480 --> 02:30:25,390
Yeah. But look what we did. Look I
Israel did to Iran's Internet, you know,

2613
02:30:25,400 --> 02:30:28,910
they fucking blew it up. They were
able to crack every, you know,

2614
02:30:28,911 --> 02:30:33,911
and we're talking about the most intense
firewalls that that could be put up by,

2615
02:30:34,371 --> 02:30:36,680
you know,
a pretty wealthy country.

2616
02:30:36,681 --> 02:30:40,310
I ran and they got in there and
they fucking destroyed everything.

2617
02:30:40,311 --> 02:30:41,300
And I think you're right,

2618
02:30:41,301 --> 02:30:46,220
there's gotta be a fail safe in place
for every country and an overall scheme.

2619
02:30:46,221 --> 02:30:50,480
I mean, there's no way somebody who's not
had the foresight to put that stuff in.

2620
02:30:52,200 --> 02:30:53,033
It's kind of

2621
02:30:53,500 --> 02:30:56,940
kind of amazing when you stop and think
about the ultimate goal of all this

2622
02:30:56,941 --> 02:31:00,120
stuff is to connect us all on
some really fucking strange way.

2623
02:31:01,150 --> 02:31:01,750
No,

2624
02:31:01,750 --> 02:31:04,390
the ultimate goal of all this technology
technologies that there's not going to

2625
02:31:04,391 --> 02:31:07,160
be any privacy in a decade.
The one exist.

2626
02:31:07,510 --> 02:31:09,520
That'd be something that we
look back on when we were kids.

2627
02:31:09,580 --> 02:31:10,630
You're going to be able to go,

2628
02:31:10,810 --> 02:31:15,160
I want to rent this six
foot like room or whatever,

2629
02:31:15,420 --> 02:31:20,160
uh, two years ago at three 15,
seven, you know, uh, here's

2630
02:31:20,160 --> 02:31:22,800
the date. You're gonna be able to
take the date, the time and go,

2631
02:31:22,801 --> 02:31:27,770
I want to see video and hear sound of
what happened in that room. You will be,

2632
02:31:28,230 --> 02:31:29,810
I bet eventually will be.

2633
02:31:30,140 --> 02:31:34,520
Well you know the idea that has been
proposed is that if you get a computer

2634
02:31:34,521 --> 02:31:37,070
that's strong enough and wrap your head
around this because it was really hard

2635
02:31:37,071 --> 02:31:38,510
to fucking absorb that.

2636
02:31:38,511 --> 02:31:43,511
If you get a computer that's strong
enough to record everything that has

2637
02:31:45,350 --> 02:31:49,670
happened in this world, like every
person that exists in this world,

2638
02:31:49,671 --> 02:31:54,230
every business has been created and
put all of this into a data bank and

2639
02:31:54,530 --> 02:31:57,970
extrapolate over a period
of no more than you know,

2640
02:31:58,010 --> 02:32:02,750
x amount of days or hours did.
If this computer with given enough data,

2641
02:32:02,900 --> 02:32:05,690
giving the, the knowing the
characteristics of all these people,

2642
02:32:05,691 --> 02:32:07,280
which eventually there'll be no room,

2643
02:32:07,310 --> 02:32:11,270
there'll be no limitations when it comes
to processing power and no limitations

2644
02:32:11,271 --> 02:32:12,380
when it comes to storage space.

2645
02:32:12,530 --> 02:32:16,280
You literally will be able to store
everything that ever happens and that this

2646
02:32:16,281 --> 02:32:17,120
computer would just,

2647
02:32:17,121 --> 02:32:22,121
a few weeks of data might be able to go
backwards mathematically and tell you

2648
02:32:22,881 --> 02:32:26,570
the absolute accurate
origins of life on earth.

2649
02:32:27,390 --> 02:32:32,090
That it might literally by studying
things, not just on a physical level,

2650
02:32:32,091 --> 02:32:33,560
but like on a subatomic level,

2651
02:32:33,561 --> 02:32:36,980
that this might be enough information
that they could figure out pretty

2652
02:32:36,981 --> 02:32:38,360
accurately what happened.

2653
02:32:38,420 --> 02:32:42,410
Like how a human being even
came from the primordial slime.

2654
02:32:42,411 --> 02:32:47,020
How it got to be a human I give it might
be able to show you the, you know, the,

2655
02:32:47,021 --> 02:32:49,840
the birth of culture and it
might be able to show you with a,

2656
02:32:49,850 --> 02:32:52,770
with a supercomputer, like what's
caused all of this? Like what,

2657
02:32:52,970 --> 02:32:55,310
how did this start caused
that and that cause this,

2658
02:32:55,430 --> 02:32:58,040
like it might be something that you
could figure out mathematically.

2659
02:32:58,610 --> 02:33:01,760
Well, what's amazing is that how
slow evolution is. I mean, you,

2660
02:33:01,761 --> 02:33:05,150
people think physical. I mean,
physical evolution takes so long. You,

2661
02:33:05,210 --> 02:33:08,570
you can't even wrap your head around the
amount of time that it would take for

2662
02:33:08,810 --> 02:33:10,700
hair to not grow on your nose.

2663
02:33:11,810 --> 02:33:16,130
You're talking fucking millions of
years of time for shit to really happen.

2664
02:33:16,430 --> 02:33:17,610
So it's,
you

2665
02:33:17,610 --> 02:33:19,260
know what's crazy?
Not always man.

2666
02:33:19,710 --> 02:33:21,210
One of the things that
they're finding out is it.

2667
02:33:21,211 --> 02:33:24,180
In some instances it takes place
much quicker than they expected.

2668
02:33:24,390 --> 02:33:28,620
Like in the Congo, the Congo is a rare
spot because it used to be grasslands,

2669
02:33:28,860 --> 02:33:33,120
but then it became a rain forest pretty
quickly and a lot of animals got trapped

2670
02:33:33,300 --> 02:33:36,060
that our grasslands,
animals like a antelopes and stuff,

2671
02:33:36,360 --> 02:33:39,510
they got trapped in the Congo and some
of them learn how to fucking swim.

2672
02:33:39,990 --> 02:33:42,010
There's a animal that's an antelope,

2673
02:33:42,060 --> 02:33:45,060
I think it's called a Diker
and it's swims and eats fish.

2674
02:33:45,180 --> 02:33:48,480
They can go under water a hundred
yards. I mean, it's fucking crazy.

2675
02:33:48,600 --> 02:33:49,920
This is an antelope man.

2676
02:33:50,020 --> 02:33:54,270
I mean it's adapted and evolved and if
you look at all of the animals that exist,

2677
02:33:54,271 --> 02:33:58,380
there's a BBC Congo documentary
that have a a brought up before.

2678
02:33:58,381 --> 02:34:01,440
If you could find it online, get
it. It's fucking sensational.

2679
02:34:01,680 --> 02:34:04,410
It just shows you all the
freaky shit that's in the Congo,

2680
02:34:04,650 --> 02:34:07,050
the birds and the lizards and the fucking,

2681
02:34:07,170 --> 02:34:10,920
the fish that come out of the water
and walk to the next part and jump in.

2682
02:34:11,220 --> 02:34:15,480
I mean that's fucking nuts man.
That's, it's, it's a really,

2683
02:34:15,481 --> 02:34:17,980
really weird spot in this world.

2684
02:34:18,040 --> 02:34:20,530
And what's this thing right
now it's just called Congo.

2685
02:34:20,531 --> 02:34:22,390
It's a BBC documentary on the Congo.

2686
02:34:22,680 --> 02:34:25,900
But these fucking things of this has
only happened over like a couple thousand

2687
02:34:25,900 --> 02:34:26,390
years.

2688
02:34:26,390 --> 02:34:29,920
And so they wonder like when did this
antelope starts swimming and eating fish?

2689
02:34:29,921 --> 02:34:32,110
Like before it was out a little like,

2690
02:34:32,320 --> 02:34:36,100
almost like a little tiny deer running
around, but now it's eating fish.

2691
02:34:36,101 --> 02:34:37,420
Like what the fuck man,

2692
02:34:37,600 --> 02:34:39,160
can you wonder? Like, you know,

2693
02:34:39,161 --> 02:34:43,000
they got that nuclear power plant down
the coast here and they talk about the

2694
02:34:43,001 --> 02:34:44,860
changes in the fish around there.

2695
02:34:44,861 --> 02:34:48,430
Cause there's a certain amount of heat
that emanates from the power plant into

2696
02:34:48,431 --> 02:34:51,640
the ocean. And they say that
there's been a change in, uh,

2697
02:34:51,880 --> 02:34:55,840
the looks of some of the fish.
Jesus Christ, a nice dinner.

2698
02:34:55,890 --> 02:34:59,580
I was wondering what, what
happens if you eat? I mean,

2699
02:34:59,581 --> 02:35:03,180
if I think it'd be really bad for the
fish to get all of that radio activity,

2700
02:35:03,360 --> 02:35:05,790
but how bad is it for you to
eat like a radioactive halibut?

2701
02:35:06,070 --> 02:35:10,060
Well, that's why they say don't eat
all fish. Don't eat fucking stuff. He,

2702
02:35:10,061 --> 02:35:14,740
he fished it lives and dies very quickly
because the longer they're around,

2703
02:35:14,741 --> 02:35:17,830
the more they're, they're taking
in, um, talk. What is it? Yeah,

2704
02:35:17,831 --> 02:35:22,220
but specifically what's the metal that
you are snakes. One of them? No. Um,

2705
02:35:22,810 --> 02:35:26,920
mercury. Mercury. Yeah. The
longer they live, the more
mercury goes in their system.

2706
02:35:27,090 --> 02:35:30,750
I had a, I tested for high levels of
arsenic from eating too many sardines.

2707
02:35:30,900 --> 02:35:33,210
No Shit. Yeah. I used
to like to eat sardines.

2708
02:35:33,211 --> 02:35:37,620
I see him like Canada and sometimes to
casting. How would you say? Disgusting.

2709
02:35:37,621 --> 02:35:39,960
But I enjoyed it. I smelled it.
I tried to make me feel bad.

2710
02:35:40,840 --> 02:35:42,450
Donald's breath went where

2711
02:35:48,250 --> 02:35:52,090
I did. Rosie O'donnell's a TV show. Ship
TV shot. Oprah's network firewall. Yeah.

2712
02:35:52,150 --> 02:35:55,540
Yeah. How was it? Sri? Nice.
Yeah. Yeah. She'd nice. Give
me a big hug and everything.

2713
02:35:56,080 --> 02:36:00,280
She's into conspiracy theories. She
just had a Hershey, oh yeah. Huge. Yeah.

2714
02:36:00,281 --> 02:36:03,400
She likes to talk nine 11. She likes
to talk. She's got some points.

2715
02:36:03,430 --> 02:36:07,060
He's got some valid points. Hey, I
respect that she didn't send up any,

2716
02:36:07,061 --> 02:36:11,650
a Wacko radar on my side. You
know, I'm all, I'm a one of
those guys that, uh, I'll,

2717
02:36:11,651 --> 02:36:15,370
I'll listen to anybody, anybody telling
any crazy conspiracy theory. I'll listen,

2718
02:36:15,700 --> 02:36:16,660
you know,
for the most part.

2719
02:36:16,720 --> 02:36:20,520
But I know when people are just like
really reaching and she wasn't, she's,

2720
02:36:20,580 --> 02:36:21,970
but she's,
you know,

2721
02:36:21,971 --> 02:36:24,610
she was on that show with like Elizabeth
handful back cause like they're really

2722
02:36:24,611 --> 02:36:28,540
hot. Chick is like Super Republican and
they would go to war about, you know,

2723
02:36:28,541 --> 02:36:32,070
like tower seven and
nine 11 conspiracies and

2724
02:36:32,700 --> 02:36:36,930
yeah. And she also said some
shit and she defend, uh, uh,

2725
02:36:38,130 --> 02:36:42,280
what's his name? Mel Gibson.
Mel. She really, she said,

2726
02:36:43,650 --> 02:36:45,810
I forget,
not a full on the fence,

2727
02:36:45,811 --> 02:36:48,340
but sort of like way more than
he should have gotten. Like,

2728
02:36:48,420 --> 02:36:51,480
but here's the thing about, I think
being somebody who is an alternate,

2729
02:36:51,570 --> 02:36:53,860
an alternate lifestyle person,
right,

2730
02:36:53,910 --> 02:36:58,890
is that you have to depart from the
status quo to be who you really are.

2731
02:36:58,891 --> 02:36:59,910
And I think with that,

2732
02:37:00,120 --> 02:37:04,020
you get some clarity and some truth in
your life that you can apply to other

2733
02:37:04,021 --> 02:37:06,840
things, conspiracy theories or
whatever. Cause she's, she's different.

2734
02:37:07,350 --> 02:37:10,920
So I think once you're labeled different,
frees you in a way

2735
02:37:11,650 --> 02:37:14,650
that's interesting. Yeah. Well,
she doesn't have to conform.

2736
02:37:14,651 --> 02:37:17,690
And she's a big lesbian. Everybody
knows who's a lesbian. She's powerful.

2737
02:37:17,691 --> 02:37:20,810
She's got a lot of money.
Chicks Schleicher she gets
hot chicks. It's kind of a,

2738
02:37:21,060 --> 02:37:23,630
it's a tricky situation.
He, Brian did we freeze up?

2739
02:37:24,580 --> 02:37:29,140
She shows him I'm frozen up. Okay. Just
came back when I asked you your video.

2740
02:37:29,240 --> 02:37:31,760
That's Voodoo. Yeah. We were frozen
for a lot of people. Watch the video.

2741
02:37:32,150 --> 02:37:35,540
I don't know that was many.
Um, we just, we, it's probably,

2742
02:37:35,541 --> 02:37:37,520
we would do way better if
we didn't even have it.

2743
02:37:37,850 --> 02:37:42,550
Do you? Sure. I just released
a podcast that was audio
only, Olive Garden podcasts.

2744
02:37:42,850 --> 02:37:47,360
It's called ready of garden butthole.
That's kind of olive garden,

2745
02:37:47,361 --> 02:37:51,380
but that's the name of the podcast and
we actually recorded live at the olive

2746
02:37:51,381 --> 02:37:53,540
garden. It's pretty
stupid. They let you do it.

2747
02:37:53,820 --> 02:37:58,820
We had a show the other day and these
people brought Brian breadsticks from the

2748
02:37:58,910 --> 02:38:01,370
Olive Garden Olive Garden
bag. It's becoming the most
ridiculous repetitive job.

2749
02:38:01,950 --> 02:38:06,440
It's so silly. But by the way, how awesome
was that fucking show? Oh, amazing.

2750
02:38:07,130 --> 02:38:10,360
Both Friday and Saturday night with Doug.
Stan hope and,

2751
02:38:10,361 --> 02:38:12,680
and Joey Diaz and Ari.

2752
02:38:12,830 --> 02:38:13,910
So much fun.
We uh,

2753
02:38:13,940 --> 02:38:17,270
we were supposed to do shows in Vegas and
I was supposed to have a UFC in Vegas,

2754
02:38:17,271 --> 02:38:21,220
but the flight got canceled so we
moved it to the Ice House that you,

2755
02:38:21,320 --> 02:38:22,910
do you go up there much besides a,

2756
02:38:22,911 --> 02:38:24,560
when you do my shows or do
you have to do weekends there?

2757
02:38:24,620 --> 02:38:29,060
I've never done it in my life. God loved
God. So one of the best clubs ever.

2758
02:38:29,061 --> 02:38:33,400
It's so perfect. It's just such
an old seasoned place short.

2759
02:38:33,430 --> 02:38:38,400
It's fucking like really low ceiling.
Like really tight, tight slide.

2760
02:38:39,440 --> 02:38:43,010
Perfect. Perfect. I did this.
I did some sort of a show.

2761
02:38:43,011 --> 02:38:47,270
I think George Lopez hosted it in 1994
those are the first time I ever went to

2762
02:38:47,271 --> 02:38:50,600
the ice house. Oh wait. It
was at any force on him?

2763
02:38:50,601 --> 02:38:55,420
What will you six TV for
for awhile. Damn, he was,

2764
02:38:55,730 --> 02:39:00,730
he was 20 and I was on stage at
the Ice House doing some TV show.

2765
02:39:00,890 --> 02:39:05,480
Yeah, I did the show. I think George
Lopez wasn't he the host of it?

2766
02:39:05,810 --> 02:39:09,830
Very Latino club too, isn't it?
Not Anymore. Now we white eat up.

2767
02:39:10,320 --> 02:39:14,750
Why did the shit out of it? Yeah,
it's still a lot of Latino's. Yeah.

2768
02:39:14,751 --> 02:39:16,490
That area has got a lot
of light to San Jose,

2769
02:39:16,700 --> 02:39:20,130
but we brought in a lot of white
boys, a lot of white kids. Just,

2770
02:39:21,140 --> 02:39:24,800
they said that there's a totally different
vibe to the club now since we've been

2771
02:39:24,801 --> 02:39:27,280
doing a lot of shows there,
which is great. You know, the,

2772
02:39:27,281 --> 02:39:31,430
the waiters and the people that work
there always complimenting the audiences

2773
02:39:31,431 --> 02:39:35,030
and stay on that. Yeah. We, we bring
in a nice group of people. We're,

2774
02:39:35,031 --> 02:39:38,010
we're super lucky and don't think that
we don't appreciate the fuck out of that

2775
02:39:38,030 --> 02:39:40,790
because I know people that are scared of
their audiences and they don't want to

2776
02:39:40,791 --> 02:39:44,180
hang out with their audience. They run
from them. You know, it's nice that uh,

2777
02:39:44,210 --> 02:39:47,270
you know, like after the show is when
we're always there talking. I mean we've,

2778
02:39:47,271 --> 02:39:49,800
we've had many nights where
we stay till one 30 then

2779
02:39:50,070 --> 02:39:52,640
no, I remember the lashline
he stood out there and they,

2780
02:39:52,650 --> 02:39:56,630
it was really nice and orderly. They
sorta like people lined up, they came in,

2781
02:39:56,660 --> 02:39:58,170
took a picture,
said hello.

2782
02:39:58,250 --> 02:40:00,870
Yeah, we just said, but there was a
lot of it is cool conversations too.

2783
02:40:00,900 --> 02:40:03,940
Like the guy who I told you, the
Iraq guy who told me, uh, you know,

2784
02:40:03,941 --> 02:40:06,950
about going over there and
flooding the economy with money.

2785
02:40:06,951 --> 02:40:10,340
He told me the whole really interesting
thing cause he was just a young kid or

2786
02:40:10,341 --> 02:40:15,341
would just fucking fucked up and joined
and areas and this crazy false pretest.

2787
02:40:16,080 --> 02:40:19,020
But he was talking about how he was
there and he was like, you know,

2788
02:40:19,050 --> 02:40:21,420
talking to someone who is like a sergeant.

2789
02:40:21,421 --> 02:40:24,900
Some guy had been there for
awhile and saying, well, you
know, we're over here to,

2790
02:40:24,901 --> 02:40:26,970
uh, you know, fight for freedom and
all that stuff. And the guy goes,

2791
02:40:26,971 --> 02:40:29,820
what the fuck are you talking about?
He goes, well, he had to get oil.

2792
02:40:30,630 --> 02:40:33,150
And he was like, what? Let's,
yeah, we're here for the oil.

2793
02:40:33,210 --> 02:40:36,080
We've got to control the oil. That's
why we're here. They built a Po,

2794
02:40:36,270 --> 02:40:40,440
a pipe from Kosovo. They already
prepared for this. And he was like, what?

2795
02:40:41,430 --> 02:40:43,440
And he remembers, you
know, talking about like,

2796
02:40:43,770 --> 02:40:45,250
he was talking to him about
how he remembers that.

2797
02:40:45,360 --> 02:40:49,050
That was just like a shattering moment
in his life. But he was like, Holy Shit,

2798
02:40:49,051 --> 02:40:52,680
this isn't a movie like
this, this, this is crazy.

2799
02:40:53,790 --> 02:40:56,400
He volunteered for some
nutty ass fucking war.

2800
02:40:56,470 --> 02:41:00,100
Well, every fucking war man,
every war that we've ever fought,

2801
02:41:00,370 --> 02:41:01,660
there's been another reason.

2802
02:41:01,840 --> 02:41:05,500
Yeah. But that one, you know, especially
the people that joined after nine 11,

2803
02:41:05,560 --> 02:41:08,050
there's a lot of people that join that
really thought they were going to do a

2804
02:41:08,051 --> 02:41:08,710
difference.

2805
02:41:08,710 --> 02:41:12,970
They really thought they were going to
go straight fucking war hero style and

2806
02:41:13,000 --> 02:41:15,760
reclaim America. Yeah, but don't
you think that's true? Every,

2807
02:41:15,790 --> 02:41:18,640
every war we've gotten it to pretty
much a, sorry, except Vietnam.

2808
02:41:18,670 --> 02:41:22,060
I think the reason why they had a drag
people in Vietnam was because Vietnam was

2809
02:41:22,061 --> 02:41:25,510
like super unpopular war that we would
probably never could get off today.

2810
02:41:25,810 --> 02:41:27,490
It just with the,
with the Internet,

2811
02:41:27,520 --> 02:41:30,310
you wouldn't be able to pull off
that sort of Gulf of Tonkin incident.

2812
02:41:30,610 --> 02:41:32,750
They would have to actually
have a real event. Really.

2813
02:41:32,980 --> 02:41:37,270
But they've done that before, man. You
know, Hitler did that. Nero did that.

2814
02:41:37,360 --> 02:41:37,571
Oh yeah.

2815
02:41:37,571 --> 02:41:42,370
The whole thinking of Alicia Tanea they
see something that happened 22 months

2816
02:41:42,371 --> 02:41:44,740
before we declared war.
That was it.

2817
02:41:44,741 --> 02:41:48,160
That was just an excuse we use
because we were in emerging nation.

2818
02:41:48,161 --> 02:41:51,850
We want it to be one of the big boys and
it was this war going on and we said,

2819
02:41:51,851 --> 02:41:56,620
fuck, if Germany wins,
we've been supplying,

2820
02:41:56,830 --> 02:41:58,870
we were making a ton of
money supplying the, uh,

2821
02:41:58,871 --> 02:42:01,060
the allied forces and if they lost,

2822
02:42:01,240 --> 02:42:05,590
we were never going to get day old as
fuck and billions in debt. They lost.

2823
02:42:05,591 --> 02:42:06,610
We weren't getting that money.

2824
02:42:06,790 --> 02:42:09,940
We went in there to hedge our bets and
make sure that it went the right way.

2825
02:42:10,630 --> 02:42:14,350
So we pretended the Lusitania was
the reason we were gone in a bunch of

2826
02:42:14,351 --> 02:42:16,300
Americans were on a
ferry ship that got sore.

2827
02:42:16,460 --> 02:42:18,950
Let's get in there and they played
it played on the heartstrings

2828
02:42:19,190 --> 02:42:24,190
well before drones and missiles and high
speed Aircrafts and all the shit that

2829
02:42:24,591 --> 02:42:25,430
we have today,

2830
02:42:25,670 --> 02:42:30,670
you had to use strategy
to win a war and strategy,

2831
02:42:30,681 --> 02:42:34,610
much like in chess involves sacrifice,
okay?

2832
02:42:34,611 --> 02:42:37,910
And there's no way to win a war if you're
not willing to sacrifice some of your

2833
02:42:37,911 --> 02:42:38,470
troops.

2834
02:42:38,470 --> 02:42:41,420
And unless you understand that you're
going to be a shitty general and you're

2835
02:42:41,421 --> 02:42:43,790
going to make even more people die,
okay?

2836
02:42:43,791 --> 02:42:48,791
So the realities of war dictate that you
do something unbelievably horrific and

2837
02:42:49,761 --> 02:42:51,740
make sure that a certain
amount of your people die.

2838
02:42:52,690 --> 02:42:55,780
Now, the final words said
by Marlon Brando, he says,

2839
02:42:56,050 --> 02:42:58,150
do you think we're going to win this war?
And he goes,

2840
02:42:58,390 --> 02:43:01,510
we came in and we vaccinated a
bunch of kids who, who would, uh,

2841
02:43:01,540 --> 02:43:05,280
who had been infected their arms or their
legs have been infected with gangrene

2842
02:43:05,290 --> 02:43:05,741
or whatever.

2843
02:43:05,741 --> 02:43:09,610
And we inoculated them and the tribal
elders came back and when they found out

2844
02:43:09,611 --> 02:43:14,350
we'd done it date machete
and off the limbs of all the
children. And that's when,

2845
02:43:14,351 --> 02:43:18,340
that's when Marlon Brando went.
He's like,

2846
02:43:18,370 --> 02:43:20,680
that's how you win a war when
you're willing to do that.

2847
02:43:20,740 --> 02:43:24,880
You win the war. Yeah. You gotta be
willing to take shit to the very,

2848
02:43:25,060 --> 02:43:27,130
very highest human level.

2849
02:43:27,910 --> 02:43:31,240
And that includes doing horrific
things to your enemy. I mean,

2850
02:43:31,241 --> 02:43:36,130
if you've read the accounts of what
the American soldiers did to American

2851
02:43:36,130 --> 02:43:39,550
Indians, native Americans, when
they were trying to clear out land,

2852
02:43:39,820 --> 02:43:43,570
they did some horrendous thing that
would wear like women's vaginas on their

2853
02:43:43,571 --> 02:43:47,380
hats. Condom out. Yeah. These
are American soldiers. Yeah.

2854
02:43:47,381 --> 02:43:49,000
There's a lot of accounts
to that kind of shit.

2855
02:43:49,210 --> 02:43:52,360
What is like hairpieces just
put it on their hat, you know,

2856
02:43:52,740 --> 02:43:54,370
like they have a fucking cowboy hat on.

2857
02:43:54,371 --> 02:43:58,060
Just stick a woman's pussy to their hat
that they cut off of an Indian that they

2858
02:43:58,061 --> 02:44:01,090
butchered out who are like native
American. I should say that.

2859
02:44:01,091 --> 02:44:04,540
The word fake mustaches. Well
I got, I got into this, uh,

2860
02:44:04,630 --> 02:44:08,210
this weird sort of uh, native, uh,

2861
02:44:08,220 --> 02:44:12,220
American fascination thing for a while
and I was reading like a lot of shit

2862
02:44:12,221 --> 02:44:16,340
about how, just the different
ways that the, the, the,

2863
02:44:16,380 --> 02:44:19,680
the people that migrated here,
it started just killing them.

2864
02:44:19,870 --> 02:44:23,920
Like how like these people had
no idea what the fuck was coming.

2865
02:44:23,921 --> 02:44:24,671
I mean it's a really,

2866
02:44:24,671 --> 02:44:28,930
an incredible amount of people were wiped
out over a short period of time and it

2867
02:44:28,931 --> 02:44:33,600
doesn't get nearly the amount of attention
and respect like in our culture does,

2868
02:44:34,070 --> 02:44:35,630
is it deserves,
yeah,

2869
02:44:35,631 --> 02:44:40,631
slavery gets a lot more cause it was
like just before we kind of like stopped

2870
02:44:40,861 --> 02:44:43,610
that sort of at the same time.
But you know,

2871
02:44:43,630 --> 02:44:47,890
it's really in a horrific thing when
you really stop and look at the actual

2872
02:44:47,891 --> 02:44:49,270
numbers of people that died.

2873
02:44:49,460 --> 02:44:54,170
People look at the Germans and they still
got, you know, the stigma of the Nazis.

2874
02:44:54,540 --> 02:44:58,310
In 10 minutes, we'll stay with the Germans
forever. But what you don't look at is,

2875
02:44:58,580 --> 02:45:01,310
you know,
what Great Britain did around the world,

2876
02:45:01,311 --> 02:45:06,020
whether you're talking about Africa,
Asia, India, you know what they,

2877
02:45:06,110 --> 02:45:11,110
the amount of people that died in the
name of manifest destiny or Christianity,

2878
02:45:11,900 --> 02:45:12,350
you know,

2879
02:45:12,350 --> 02:45:17,350
the British are truly the per capita
have committed more atrocities than any

2880
02:45:17,421 --> 02:45:21,170
race in history. And yet wasps in this
country, it doesn't get any better.

2881
02:45:21,200 --> 02:45:23,300
They are the most heralded.
There's no,

2882
02:45:23,330 --> 02:45:28,310
there's no racist jokes about the British
except her teeth. Yeah. That's it.

2883
02:45:28,311 --> 02:45:29,060
That's not bad.

2884
02:45:29,060 --> 02:45:33,240
Not Bad at all. It's truly
giant to a big vaginas. Yeah.

2885
02:45:33,890 --> 02:45:36,950
Cause they have bigger heads so that
their babies are, have bigger heads. Wow.

2886
02:45:37,310 --> 02:45:40,280
I didn't hear that park.
But yeah, it's, well,

2887
02:45:40,290 --> 02:45:42,560
what's really incredible is that we're

2888
02:45:44,060 --> 02:45:46,370
the byproduct of all that craziness.

2889
02:45:46,640 --> 02:45:50,570
All the raping and pillaging
and sword fighting and shit.

2890
02:45:50,750 --> 02:45:52,310
It's all come to,
you know,

2891
02:45:52,490 --> 02:45:55,820
native Americans being killed and
people tracking across it and boom,

2892
02:45:55,910 --> 02:45:58,160
here we are.
I mean we're at the very end of the time,

2893
02:45:58,370 --> 02:46:00,950
we're at the west coast of California,
the United States.

2894
02:46:00,951 --> 02:46:03,170
The last spot that people
settled in the free world.

2895
02:46:03,500 --> 02:46:05,600
This is the new world's final chapter.
I mean,

2896
02:46:05,601 --> 02:46:09,410
if you really stop and think about it,
there's no, unless Antarctica defrost,

2897
02:46:09,500 --> 02:46:10,370
we start moving

2898
02:46:10,370 --> 02:46:12,980
cities up there. But if that
becomes like the new cool place,

2899
02:46:12,981 --> 02:46:16,580
like the perfect weather to Greenland,
you know,

2900
02:46:16,650 --> 02:46:18,770
all of a sudden Greenland became,
no,

2901
02:46:18,950 --> 02:46:22,880
Iceland became the place because it
warmed the fuck up and they rent.

2902
02:46:22,910 --> 02:46:24,890
There's hot chicks and everybody went.

2903
02:46:24,891 --> 02:46:28,200
It became like the fastest growing
economy in the world for a while.

2904
02:46:28,840 --> 02:46:33,840
Call accept the fact that this whole
planet spins in a weird way and it goes

2905
02:46:34,611 --> 02:46:38,750
through cycles where shit gets really
fucking cold and when that happens in your

2906
02:46:38,751 --> 02:46:40,850
spot, you got to move. You can't be,

2907
02:46:40,880 --> 02:46:44,450
we can't be like completely
dedicated to one spot.

2908
02:46:44,480 --> 02:46:47,390
It's ridiculous because you look
at the history of the world,

2909
02:46:47,600 --> 02:46:50,600
they find these mega don teeth in Montana,

2910
02:46:50,990 --> 02:46:55,180
these giant shark teeth from his
fucking 80 foot long monster sharp.

2911
02:46:55,190 --> 02:46:58,760
They used to live, they find them in
Montana. That means Montana was the ocean.

2912
02:46:59,210 --> 02:47:00,620
Like you can't just say,
oh,

2913
02:47:03,680 --> 02:47:07,460
you can't goes away. It's going
to get you. You got it. You can't,

2914
02:47:07,490 --> 02:47:10,470
if you're living in Malibu, you're
living in a fucking dream. Okay.

2915
02:47:10,950 --> 02:47:14,990
Cause people that live like on
the water, good luck. Good call.

2916
02:47:15,020 --> 02:47:19,010
You're at the edge. Are you
that confidence that the
edge is going to stay there?

2917
02:47:19,040 --> 02:47:21,120
Do you put your finger
right near a fan every day?

2918
02:47:21,490 --> 02:47:24,160
That's what I done living in la
though. Oh yeah, you're right.

2919
02:47:24,400 --> 02:47:27,920
I mean in a certain extent,
but I think that if the real,

2920
02:47:27,950 --> 02:47:29,630
the real thing happens like that,

2921
02:47:29,631 --> 02:47:33,230
like something that the water comes
this far in, you know, we're dead.

2922
02:47:33,320 --> 02:47:34,190
We're already dead.

2923
02:47:34,310 --> 02:47:39,310
Well you look at down in Mexico at
Easter and we were in south of can't coon

2924
02:47:40,401 --> 02:47:44,930
that whole, that whole area. Yeah,
exactly. That shit was, you know,

2925
02:47:44,931 --> 02:47:48,260
we go into snow days and you go down a
hundred feet and they're showing you in

2926
02:47:48,261 --> 02:47:52,400
the caves. All of these fucking,
you know that the ocean,

2927
02:47:52,670 --> 02:47:53,301
basically,

2928
02:47:53,301 --> 02:47:57,500
there was a tsunami that landed on that
area and it took thousands of years for

2929
02:47:57,501 --> 02:48:01,310
the water to drain through that
land again. And it was just,

2930
02:48:01,311 --> 02:48:02,740
it was fucking underwater there.

2931
02:48:02,741 --> 02:48:07,110
They're finding hundreds of
cities in Europe and in the,

2932
02:48:07,111 --> 02:48:11,140
in the oceans. They're
finding the remanence is on a
constant basis. I'm like, uh,

2933
02:48:11,350 --> 02:48:14,420
uh, you know it's happening. I said
hundreds, but it's really been dozens,

2934
02:48:14,570 --> 02:48:17,540
but it really has been like super frequent
that they're finding more and more of

2935
02:48:17,541 --> 02:48:21,650
these ancient civilizations that are
underwater. It's just going to happen.

2936
02:48:21,680 --> 02:48:22,710
It's just what it is. The, the,

2937
02:48:22,890 --> 02:48:25,340
the earth doesn't give a fuck about you
remember that you used to be the whole

2938
02:48:25,341 --> 02:48:27,470
thing of like there's
the lost city of Atlanta.

2939
02:48:27,471 --> 02:48:29,150
It's like now there's
about a thousand of them.

2940
02:48:29,570 --> 02:48:34,130
There's places that went underwater.
There's so much underwater shit. There's,

2941
02:48:34,190 --> 02:48:37,220
I mean, and by the way, how
much shit is underwater.

2942
02:48:37,221 --> 02:48:40,320
I mean like what do you get like 10,000
years for the ocean changes it. Well,

2943
02:48:40,321 --> 02:48:41,570
you can never recognize it again.

2944
02:48:41,840 --> 02:48:44,900
How long does it actually stay with
all those waves and shit happening?

2945
02:48:45,110 --> 02:48:49,640
How long before that stuff
was unrecognizable roads,

2946
02:48:50,150 --> 02:48:52,250
sand and covered in sand and shit.

2947
02:48:53,160 --> 02:48:56,390
Fucking many sea ships are out there.
What a terrifying way to die.

2948
02:48:56,391 --> 02:48:58,880
That must've been getting a boat,

2949
02:48:59,180 --> 02:49:04,180
hit an iceberg and then realize you are
just fucking days by boat from anywhere

2950
02:49:06,020 --> 02:49:08,000
out in the middle of the I do it.
I

2951
02:49:08,000 --> 02:49:08,270
went,

2952
02:49:08,270 --> 02:49:12,200
I was boogie boarding yesterday and I
went too far out and big fucking waves.

2953
02:49:12,620 --> 02:49:17,060
So I get fucking slam first.
I'm going under these giant waves.

2954
02:49:17,061 --> 02:49:21,260
I mean these are like seven foot waves
and I start going under them and then,

2955
02:49:21,440 --> 02:49:26,060
which you normally can do, but then it
was fucking sucking me and I'd spin.

2956
02:49:26,360 --> 02:49:30,680
So I do it like three or four times and
I'm trying to go out past the waves so

2957
02:49:30,681 --> 02:49:33,530
that I can get my air
cause I ain't getting in.

2958
02:49:33,531 --> 02:49:37,340
I look out when I'm fucking like
50 yards out and I just start.

2959
02:49:37,341 --> 02:49:41,060
So then I finally catch one and take
it a little bit and then I go under,

2960
02:49:41,120 --> 02:49:44,000
flipped around and now
I can touch the sand.

2961
02:49:44,330 --> 02:49:47,840
But the waves are still fucking giant
and so they're landing on me and I can't

2962
02:49:47,841 --> 02:49:48,680
get under the wave.

2963
02:49:48,710 --> 02:49:52,820
So it's fucking hitting the into the
sand and spinning me and I can't get out.

2964
02:49:52,970 --> 02:49:54,080
So long story short,

2965
02:49:54,081 --> 02:49:59,081
I finally fucking just scramble
and there's a lifeguard
waist deep coming at me

2966
02:49:59,300 --> 02:50:02,550
and he's like, dude, you are right.
It's like you got fucking pounded.

2967
02:50:02,570 --> 02:50:06,500
And the thing is my wife, there's a
whole bunch of people watching my family,

2968
02:50:06,501 --> 02:50:09,860
all my friends and shit and they're
like, were you scared? And I was like,

2969
02:50:10,040 --> 02:50:11,180
I didn't have time.

2970
02:50:11,181 --> 02:50:14,450
It never occurred to me because
I'm sure it's like when you fight,

2971
02:50:14,720 --> 02:50:17,240
if you stop and are scared for a second,

2972
02:50:17,300 --> 02:50:20,330
you just lost your fucking
ability to problem solve.

2973
02:50:21,170 --> 02:50:24,500
And then my back is on fire today
and I realize how fucked up I got.

2974
02:50:24,650 --> 02:50:27,000
Well the only way to stop that
feeling is to get over it. No,

2975
02:50:27,001 --> 02:50:31,840
I mean that feeling being in water and
just getting tossed and like it's just

2976
02:50:32,010 --> 02:50:32,843
socks.

2977
02:50:32,970 --> 02:50:36,520
So if you haven't had an experience like
that where you have to really operate

2978
02:50:36,521 --> 02:50:39,100
under extreme pressure,
it can be really debilitating.

2979
02:50:39,101 --> 02:50:40,480
Some people just immediately give up.

2980
02:50:40,510 --> 02:50:44,980
It gets really scary where some people
find like surprising resolve and it's a

2981
02:50:44,981 --> 02:50:47,500
weird thing about human beings,
like how much your,

2982
02:50:47,501 --> 02:50:51,910
your mind is capable of doing
five minutes, but people
are one way or the other.

2983
02:50:52,570 --> 02:50:57,220
Yeah. Let's wrap this up because we're
running out of time at three hours.

2984
02:50:57,221 --> 02:51:02,100

it three falls off every time.

2985
02:51:02,101 --> 02:51:04,720

2986

known you like you're up there like one

2987
02:51:10,541 --> 02:51:14,530

contact with in my life. Feels good. Yeah.

2988
02:51:14,531 --> 02:51:17,860

fun. Play some pool. Definitely powerful.

Get TV and get yourself a juicy, delicious
tee shirt out. This isn't a desk.

3004
02:52:11,060 --> 02:52:13,330
Why cut a desk? Go out and
get a TV. And I'm like,

3005
02:52:13,340 --> 02:52:17,740
what documents do you fuck
up the commercials that I
make for you? Silly Bitch.

3006
02:52:18,220 --> 02:52:22,540
Got a desk, squad.tv if you will, if
you'll ask where to get the um, the uh,

3007
02:52:23,050 --> 02:52:27,280
Brian Red Band versions of the desk, squad
tee shirts. They're all there. The, uh,

3008
02:52:27,310 --> 02:52:30,040
the one that I liked, the, I
liked the cat and the new one,

3009
02:52:30,041 --> 02:52:32,680
but I liked the thanks
for knocking my shirt.

3010
02:52:34,510 --> 02:52:37,630
I like your shirt, but I don't
like everything extended.
Like this one part of it.

3011
02:52:37,720 --> 02:52:39,400
I'm just telling you what I'm like.
Do you want me to lie?

3012
02:52:39,790 --> 02:52:43,480
I'm telling you what I like. You
tell me what you like. It's part of,

3013
02:52:44,750 --> 02:52:48,160
I've heard nothing but positive
things about everybody but me.

3014
02:52:48,161 --> 02:52:50,860
I love this free pussy riot
shirt that I got right here.

3015
02:52:51,460 --> 02:52:55,120
But the cool thing about the shirt is
that all of the proceeds go to desk

3016
02:52:55,121 --> 02:52:57,940
squad.tv.
So I can pay for everything.

3017
02:52:58,000 --> 02:53:01,900
And that's what the shirt is
about. Death Squad. Dot. TV.

3018
02:53:02,480 --> 02:53:04,510
Do you mean all the money goes to
you is what you're trying to say?

3019
02:53:04,570 --> 02:53:09,400
So you can get to get paid for this
thing pays for everything in this thing.

3020
02:53:09,430 --> 02:53:13,330
I pay. Oh, nevermind. I don't
want you to do. Okay. So yeah,
