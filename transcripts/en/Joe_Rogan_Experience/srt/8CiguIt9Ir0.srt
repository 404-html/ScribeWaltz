1
00:00:15,050 --> 00:00:18,500
What's wrong with you or you started 
already?

2
00:00:19,060 --> 00:00:22,220
You already had started.
We just,

3
00:00:22,221 --> 00:00:23,480
I just,
we just went live.

4
00:00:23,730 --> 00:00:25,920
Hey everybody.
Fuck what's going on?

5
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:29,660
We understand folks.
We hear your story.

6
00:00:29,720 --> 00:00:33,250
You hear your plight that a ustream has 
been fucking up for you.

7
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:34,250
Uh,
it's been,

8
00:00:34,330 --> 00:00:35,990
um,
what it was called?

9
00:00:36,350 --> 00:00:38,300
Buffering.
It just lost my mic.

10
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:40,490
You know what I've noticed though,
Joe,

11
00:00:40,491 --> 00:00:43,850
is that browsers,
so if,

12
00:00:43,851 --> 00:00:48,851
if it's fucking with you on one browser,
tried different one because the flash 

13
00:00:48,851 --> 00:00:49,400
plugin alone has been just a connie 
bitch.

14
00:00:49,820 --> 00:00:50,580
Is that what it is?
Yeah,

15
00:00:50,830 --> 00:00:52,270
like a,
like on Youtube,

16
00:00:52,330 --> 00:00:57,330
Youtube.
I have problems on certain browsers 

17
00:00:57,330 --> 00:00:58,070
where it does certain things and I 
changed it around and I've been noticing

18
00:00:58,071 --> 00:01:01,610
is a lot of browser issues.
I use chrome for the most part.

19
00:01:01,611 --> 00:01:03,020
What do you use?
I use safari.

20
00:01:03,021 --> 00:01:04,020
I went back to so far.

21
00:01:04,650 --> 00:01:09,650
Why did you go back too far?
Because it seems like it's usually the 

22
00:01:09,650 --> 00:01:10,430
best when it comes to working with 
everything,

23
00:01:10,930 --> 00:01:13,130
but it's crazy.
It's been fucking with everything.

24
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:15,800
It didn't use to write.
It didn't use to be the best one.

25
00:01:15,860 --> 00:01:16,700
I don't think so.
No,

26
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:18,440
but it's always been solid for me.
Crumbs.

27
00:01:18,441 --> 00:01:23,441
Good.
But the problem with chrome is that I 

28
00:01:23,441 --> 00:01:25,990
just go crazy with extensions and next 
thing I know if he fucks things up like 

29
00:01:25,990 --> 00:01:29,861
ad block plus or whatever,
that shit fucks things up and then you 

30
00:01:29,861 --> 00:01:33,401
forget that.
That might be the reason why you know 

31
00:01:33,401 --> 00:01:33,401
you almost so far,
every type of motherfucker.

32
00:01:33,710 --> 00:01:36,080
This episode,
speaking of the web is brought to you by

33
00:01:36,081 --> 00:01:39,800
squarespace.
You go to squarespace.com,

34
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:42,760
forward slash rope.
Joe,

35
00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:45,770
what does Joe?
Whereas squarespace.com

36
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:49,160
forward slash Joe,
if you go and check it out,

37
00:01:49,161 --> 00:01:51,050
you could design your own website.

38
00:01:51,050 --> 00:01:52,970
Joey Diaz.
I know you could pull it off.

39
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,560
It's not deaf.
Stupid.

40
00:01:54,690 --> 00:01:55,580
You say that,
man,

41
00:01:55,581 --> 00:01:57,170
but I'm telling you with something like 
squarespace,

42
00:01:57,171 --> 00:01:58,400
you can do it.
I could do it.

43
00:01:58,460 --> 00:02:03,460
It's,
I'm not sure you're that much farther 

44
00:02:03,460 --> 00:02:07,090
behind me.
You know Brian does them while the 

45
00:02:07,090 --> 00:02:07,100
show's going on.
He's whacking out websites,

46
00:02:07,430 --> 00:02:08,720
you know,
saying dog.

47
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:11,840
What's interesting about it is you can 
try it.

48
00:02:11,930 --> 00:02:16,930
It's not interesting.
It's excellent about it is you can try 

49
00:02:16,930 --> 00:02:18,110
it without actually paying for it first.
So you can go,

50
00:02:18,250 --> 00:02:23,250
you sign up,
you don't have to give your credit card 

51
00:02:23,250 --> 00:02:23,250
and no,
you don't have to do anything,

52
00:02:23,250 --> 00:02:24,320
just try it out,
start building your website,

53
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:27,380
and then if you decide to purchase 
squarespace,

54
00:02:27,650 --> 00:02:32,650
use the offer code Joe Seven and you 
will get 10 percent off your first 

55
00:02:33,291 --> 00:02:35,870
purchase.
It's a sweet spot.

56
00:02:36,140 --> 00:02:40,550
You should really check it out because 
you can make a very professional looking

57
00:02:40,551 --> 00:02:45,551
website in a tiny amount of time,
including setting up your own online 

58
00:02:45,551 --> 00:02:45,860
store.

59
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:51,040
I have had many sponsors on this podcast
and I can tell you this,

60
00:02:51,590 --> 00:02:56,590
there is one,
one sponsor that I've never had any 

61
00:02:56,590 --> 00:03:01,060
negative feedback on that squarespace.
No ever said anything bad about people 

62
00:03:01,060 --> 00:03:05,820
say bad about every.
People can fucking find a way to 

63
00:03:05,820 --> 00:03:06,340
complain about anything.
There's always,

64
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:08,770
and not saying that their complaints 
aren't necessarily valid,

65
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:10,900
you know,
I think sometimes,

66
00:03:10,901 --> 00:03:12,520
uh,
people are correct.

67
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:15,730
They're over judgmental,
but oftentimes they are correct.

68
00:03:16,090 --> 00:03:18,340
But squarespace,
100 percent,

69
00:03:18,580 --> 00:03:21,850
not one person has said anything bad 
about it to me yet.

70
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:26,880
Now Watch.
I'll go on twitter and then they'll 

71
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:26,880
count it up for me anyway.
Go to squarespace.com

72
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:31,561
forward slash Joe.
Use the offer code Joe Seven and save 

73
00:03:31,561 --> 00:03:33,090
yourself 10 percent off.
All right.

74
00:03:33,140 --> 00:03:36,640
God dammit.
We're also brought to you by legal zoom.

75
00:03:37,390 --> 00:03:42,390
Legal Zoom is a website where you can 
get a lot of shit done that ordinarily 

76
00:03:42,491 --> 00:03:45,760
you would have to go to a lawyer for 
like you can get.

77
00:03:46,050 --> 00:03:51,050
You can incorporate or you can form an 
llc which is limited legal.

78
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:54,040
Oh No,
I know what it means.

79
00:03:54,041 --> 00:03:55,030
What is LLC mean exactly?

80
00:03:55,250 --> 00:04:00,250
It's where you make a company so you 
could dump all your money into and then 

81
00:04:00,250 --> 00:04:01,760
once it fucks up you run and started a 
new company.

82
00:04:01,860 --> 00:04:06,860
Yeah.
And you don't owe anybody any money or 

83
00:04:06,860 --> 00:04:06,860
something.
Something.

84
00:04:06,860 --> 00:04:09,690
Yeah.
I've had people who have been fucked 

85
00:04:09,690 --> 00:04:10,791
over.
Like you could do an llc at legal zoom 

86
00:04:11,221 --> 00:04:16,221
for only 100 bucks.
So if you want to start fucking people 

87
00:04:16,221 --> 00:04:18,231
off,
it's only 99 bucks and then somehow or 

88
00:04:18,231 --> 00:04:18,231
another,
I don't know

89
00:04:18,231 --> 00:04:19,860
what happened to get a will at that 
time,

90
00:04:19,861 --> 00:04:22,230
which you could also do at legal zoom.
That's another good idea.

91
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:27,300
You start fucking people over to get mad
and they want to shoot you so you can 

92
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:29,540
make your own will for just 69 bucks.
You can also get living trusts,

93
00:04:29,870 --> 00:04:34,870
power of attorney and more in the past 
12 years or over 2 million Americans 

94
00:04:34,911 --> 00:04:37,580
have used legal zoom and they've said 
fuckloads of money.

95
00:04:37,820 --> 00:04:42,820
It's a sweet set up and if you use the 
code Rogan in the referral box,

96
00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:48,250
you'll save yourself some money.
Remember that legalzoom is not a law 

97
00:04:48,250 --> 00:04:52,061
firm.
They just provide self help services at 

98
00:04:52,061 --> 00:04:56,111
your specific direction and they can 
also connect you with an independent 

99
00:04:56,111 --> 00:04:56,270
tourney.
Independent attorney.

100
00:04:56,720 --> 00:05:01,720
No attorney fuckhead.
They can also connect you with an 

101
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:04,820
independent attorney if you need 
additional guidance.

102
00:05:05,180 --> 00:05:06,980
So check it out.
Legalzoom.com.

103
00:05:07,190 --> 00:05:08,660
Use the code name,
Rogan boom.

104
00:05:08,790 --> 00:05:09,610
Shock.
Shock.

105
00:05:09,730 --> 00:05:11,090
Shock.
A boom.

106
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:12,650
Um,
what was the other one?

107
00:05:12,651 --> 00:05:14,380
I had to do?
Square stamps.

108
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:14,940
Legals.
Oh,

109
00:05:14,990 --> 00:05:16,880
stamps.com.
Stamps.com.

110
00:05:16,881 --> 00:05:21,881
Which is appropriate because the new 
desk squad shirts are on preorder as of 

111
00:05:21,881 --> 00:05:22,680
right now.
If you go to a desk,

112
00:05:22,690 --> 00:05:27,690
[inaudible] dot TV.
My favorite of all the designs that 

113
00:05:27,690 --> 00:05:27,830
Brian has created,
I actually love this one.

114
00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:30,290
That's fucking bad ass.
I love the cat.

115
00:05:30,291 --> 00:05:32,090
And the last one,
he was my favorite cat,

116
00:05:32,091 --> 00:05:33,710
but this is a cool shirt.
This is a,

117
00:05:33,980 --> 00:05:36,020
I love the colors too.
And it's um,

118
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:38,480
it's a very high quality shirt as 
opposed to.

119
00:05:38,730 --> 00:05:43,730
It's not that the other ones were low 
quality but they're like the standard 

120
00:05:43,730 --> 00:05:43,790
way you get a t shirt when you have like
a big design.

121
00:05:43,791 --> 00:05:45,670
Like that desk squad logo is,
they just,

122
00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:47,860
they take like a vinyl,
I don't know,

123
00:05:47,870 --> 00:05:49,900
it's fine or whatever it is,
but some sort of static.

124
00:05:50,150 --> 00:05:53,140
It's like a thick.
It's the process is just a bunch of.

125
00:05:53,180 --> 00:05:54,910
It's like it feels to have a plastic 
shield on.

126
00:05:54,930 --> 00:05:56,480
So like when you're working out you feel
like this,

127
00:05:56,510 --> 00:06:01,510
like,
like you almost have armor on and it's 

128
00:06:01,510 --> 00:06:01,820
very uncomfortable when you have a lot 
of colors when you get sweaty.

129
00:06:01,850 --> 00:06:03,080
Yeah,
yeah.

130
00:06:03,230 --> 00:06:04,850
If you get sweaty it gets weird.
So this,

131
00:06:04,851 --> 00:06:08,870
this process actually bleaches the shirt
and then read the ink in it.

132
00:06:08,871 --> 00:06:09,970
So it's actually the,
the,

133
00:06:10,110 --> 00:06:10,860
the,
just,

134
00:06:11,020 --> 00:06:13,130
just the cotton,
so you can't even feel the design.

135
00:06:13,131 --> 00:06:15,500
So it's an upgrade from the last couple 
of shirts I did.

136
00:06:15,501 --> 00:06:17,390
So I wanted to have a little bit better 
quality.

137
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:18,200
Yeah.
Well,

138
00:06:18,201 --> 00:06:23,201
you know,
he saw how my higher primates shirts be 

139
00:06:23,201 --> 00:06:25,040
rocking it and like damn son.
Why they so sweet.

140
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:27,140
Oh you know,
because of my man,

141
00:06:27,141 --> 00:06:30,020
Mike Maxwell draw me something funky.
Champs.

142
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:31,180
That's right.
Um,

143
00:06:31,190 --> 00:06:31,880
so uh,
yeah.

144
00:06:31,881 --> 00:06:34,460
So these would be coming up really soon.
So jump on him now.

145
00:06:34,461 --> 00:06:34,860
Um,
they,

146
00:06:34,910 --> 00:06:39,320
I mean I see a shit load of these old 
ones every time I performed,

147
00:06:39,590 --> 00:06:41,720
including this past weekend when Joey 
Diaz,

148
00:06:41,721 --> 00:06:44,210
when I wear a rock in the joint and 
Vegas.

149
00:06:44,211 --> 00:06:46,300
Goddamn son.
Fuck God.

150
00:06:46,301 --> 00:06:47,360
Damn.
We'll talk about that.

151
00:06:47,390 --> 00:06:52,390
We'll talk about that.
We'll talk about the UFC and more legal 

152
00:06:52,390 --> 00:06:52,390
stamp doc.
Um,

153
00:06:52,390 --> 00:06:53,950
and legal squarespace dot zoom.
No,

154
00:06:55,190 --> 00:06:57,800
I'm just kidding.
No I didn't get the stamps.

155
00:06:57,801 --> 00:06:59,030
Dot Com site.
Really real fuck up.

156
00:06:59,031 --> 00:07:02,390
Could you imagine if I was that far?
High stamps.com.

157
00:07:02,420 --> 00:07:03,950
If you go there,
if you click on it,

158
00:07:03,951 --> 00:07:07,250
they have that old school microphone in 
the upper right hand corner.

159
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:12,480
Well,
if you click on that old school 

160
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:12,480
microphone and enter in the code name j 
e r e,

161
00:07:12,650 --> 00:07:15,380
which stands for the jail Rogan 
experience.

162
00:07:15,650 --> 00:07:18,970
You can save an ass load of money,
including um,

163
00:07:19,090 --> 00:07:23,420
it's $110 thing off.
You get a free scale,

164
00:07:23,421 --> 00:07:26,180
a digital scale which you are not to use
for marijuana.

165
00:07:26,181 --> 00:07:28,550
Sir.
This is for sending packages.

166
00:07:28,610 --> 00:07:30,050
Asshole.
Okay.

167
00:07:30,051 --> 00:07:31,880
You Do,
do not send.

168
00:07:32,210 --> 00:07:37,210
Listened to me.
Do not send marijuana through the post 

169
00:07:37,210 --> 00:07:38,890
office use ups because the post office 
that's like,

170
00:07:39,110 --> 00:07:41,990
it's against the law.
They'll put you in a fucking cage.

171
00:07:42,210 --> 00:07:47,210
It once,
they'll break your shit and Hollywood 

172
00:07:47,210 --> 00:07:47,210
and take the weed themselves.
They're fucking savages.

173
00:07:47,210 --> 00:07:48,460
And you can't blame.
If I was a mailman,

174
00:07:48,470 --> 00:07:50,930
I'd be ripping up a envelope.
Students get sent that.

175
00:07:50,990 --> 00:07:52,650
Yeah,
it's the code.

176
00:07:52,850 --> 00:07:55,280
The codes of sweet code.
You save a lot of money off of what they

177
00:07:55,281 --> 00:07:57,210
normally offer,
but even if he didn't have my code,

178
00:07:57,211 --> 00:08:00,110
it's a great deal.
And you get this sweet digital scale.

179
00:08:00,111 --> 00:08:02,540
And what you do is you print,
like say if you're selling anything like

180
00:08:02,550 --> 00:08:05,240
Brian selling those t shirts,
you just make it yourself,

181
00:08:05,270 --> 00:08:09,440
have it printed up yourself and you just
weigh the packages on a digital scale.

182
00:08:09,441 --> 00:08:14,441
You print up everything off of your 
computer or Boehm handed to the 

183
00:08:14,441 --> 00:08:14,840
postmaster.
Done.

184
00:08:14,910 --> 00:08:19,910
I used it today actually.
I haven't used the mail in a long time 

185
00:08:19,910 --> 00:08:20,040
and I didn't have a stamp.
I'm like fuck,

186
00:08:20,041 --> 00:08:21,450
I got to go to the store and like,
Oh yeah,

187
00:08:21,451 --> 00:08:26,451
I have stamps.com
and I just put the envelope in the 

188
00:08:26,451 --> 00:08:26,451
printer.
Bam,

189
00:08:26,451 --> 00:08:26,630
boom it in the mailbox.
It's so easy kid.

190
00:08:26,970 --> 00:08:27,790
You can't go

191
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:30,960
wrong.
Go to stamps.com

192
00:08:31,020 --> 00:08:36,020
and use the code j r e and save yourself
some money on an excellent service.

193
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:43,400
And I'm supposed to say something 
official to give you shit to sale like 

194
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:43,400
something official,
but

195
00:08:43,420 --> 00:08:45,130
it's $110 value.
Yeah,

196
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:46,390
it's what it is,

197
00:08:46,610 --> 00:08:49,490
is a really good deal.
That's what I think about stamps.com.

198
00:08:49,491 --> 00:08:52,610
I think it just totally makes sense if 
you're.

199
00:08:52,670 --> 00:08:57,670
If you're smart,
like why would you want to go to the 

200
00:08:57,670 --> 00:08:58,480
fucking post?
Joe Rogan sell them that I'm talking to.

201
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:02,250
You don't have that many years left.
I don't have 20 minutes to go down there

202
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:03,960
and wait for the fucking.
It's a nightmare.

203
00:09:03,961 --> 00:09:07,200
Going to be a lot more than 20 minutes 
if you go to the wrong post office.

204
00:09:07,210 --> 00:09:12,210
The wrong time.
I've been there before where it took me 

205
00:09:12,210 --> 00:09:12,210
an hour and 10 minutes just to go.
Yes.

206
00:09:12,630 --> 00:09:17,630
Yeah.
There was a gang of people and they all 

207
00:09:17,630 --> 00:09:17,630
had shit to way that were all saying it 
was around Christmas.

208
00:09:17,630 --> 00:09:18,420
I was an asshole.
I was like,

209
00:09:18,421 --> 00:09:19,570
wow,
this is bad.

210
00:09:19,590 --> 00:09:20,380
I hate going up.
Boy.

211
00:09:20,430 --> 00:09:22,480
I got a box at the Po box.
I go there.

212
00:09:22,570 --> 00:09:26,280
You gotta give it together with online 
and I forget to go and I get emails from

213
00:09:26,281 --> 00:09:27,570
people.
They sent my shit back.

214
00:09:28,020 --> 00:09:29,580
Yeah,
and I don't want to burden these fucking

215
00:09:29,581 --> 00:09:34,581
people either.
Who wants to be the 30th person in line 

216
00:09:34,581 --> 00:09:35,640
that day with stacks of shit for them to
send out and they're tired of doing your

217
00:09:35,641 --> 00:09:37,710
God damn work for you?
Stamps.com.

218
00:09:37,711 --> 00:09:40,620
Just needs to get a passport thing 
because that's the only reason I have to

219
00:09:40,621 --> 00:09:45,621
go to the post office now it's for like 
when you have to do things like 

220
00:09:45,621 --> 00:09:48,000
passports are showing that just it's 
annoying because you're mixing passport.

221
00:09:48,001 --> 00:09:50,070
People in with fucking regular mail 
people.

222
00:09:50,540 --> 00:09:52,800
Pat Bluebeam.
Like getting a new passport.

223
00:09:52,801 --> 00:09:53,670
Is that what you mean?
Yeah,

224
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:58,700
that's where I got my passport recently.
It was a pain in the ass at the post 

225
00:09:58,700 --> 00:10:01,280
office today.
And why is that together?

226
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:06,500
A dozen drugs,
tobacco and firearms and tobacco,

227
00:10:07,230 --> 00:10:09,600
Tobacco,
alcohol and firearms.

228
00:10:09,630 --> 00:10:10,860
They're all together.
Like how?

229
00:10:11,370 --> 00:10:14,130
What the fuck is why those three 
together?

230
00:10:14,310 --> 00:10:16,860
That's ridiculous.
Passports and stamps.

231
00:10:17,580 --> 00:10:19,840
So you can send a package or you.
Yeah,

232
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:23,570
whatever you're sending through the air.
I mean Joe Rogan.

233
00:10:23,580 --> 00:10:28,530
Why would drugs tobacco and show up to a
rescue for tobacco?

234
00:10:28,531 --> 00:10:31,190
Like if you were selling them with 
stickers on me.

235
00:10:33,110 --> 00:10:36,540
Well you could sell stolen shit.
It could be that you could be,

236
00:10:36,541 --> 00:10:38,940
yeah,
you could be like not having a tax stamp

237
00:10:38,941 --> 00:10:43,941
or something,
so like you're a company that's trying 

238
00:10:43,941 --> 00:10:44,190
to sell it and not pay taxes on it.
People are crazy,

239
00:10:44,191 --> 00:10:49,191
man.
You always hear about people that are 

240
00:10:49,191 --> 00:10:49,191
like running businesses for a couple of 
years.

241
00:10:49,191 --> 00:10:53,660
Gangster style cash,
only pay no taxes and then they just 

242
00:10:53,660 --> 00:10:54,740
vanish and it happens all the time.
You know,

243
00:10:54,750 --> 00:10:55,410
there was a.

244
00:10:55,650 --> 00:11:00,650
We had this lady yesterday from the 
Oxycontin Express who was talking about 

245
00:11:00,650 --> 00:11:03,660
those pain clinics of Florida and one of
them was cash only.

246
00:11:04,110 --> 00:11:06,390
They were there for two years.
He made $40,000,000

247
00:11:07,070 --> 00:11:11,830
and then they got arrested.
When they hook you up with some oxy?

248
00:11:12,990 --> 00:11:14,010
Yeah,
if you're a.

249
00:11:14,011 --> 00:11:16,560
If you're interested,
go listen to it because she was a.

250
00:11:16,620 --> 00:11:21,620
The whole story was fucking amazing.
We can talk about that on the podcast 

251
00:11:21,620 --> 00:11:23,010
because I know.
Oh all day dog.

252
00:11:23,011 --> 00:11:26,900
We just got off oxy and out to get a 
little beautiful.

253
00:11:27,430 --> 00:11:29,010
We're also brought to you by [inaudible]
dot com.

254
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:33,120
As always.
I can't say it in a different way.

255
00:11:33,150 --> 00:11:38,150
I've tried.
I've tried that commercials in a 

256
00:11:38,150 --> 00:11:38,150
different way.
I've tried,

257
00:11:38,150 --> 00:11:41,330
if you've never heard this podcast 
before on a dessert company and full 

258
00:11:41,330 --> 00:11:42,450
disclosure that I have a financial stake
in,

259
00:11:42,700 --> 00:11:45,750
uh,
and essentially we sell really just shit

260
00:11:45,751 --> 00:11:49,850
that I use shit that Aubrey and I use 
shit that people use it.

261
00:11:49,850 --> 00:11:54,850
They're trying to get in shape.
It's like we sell a lot of kettlebells 

262
00:11:54,850 --> 00:11:57,830
and we have these things called primal 
bells or kettlebells with this cool 

263
00:11:57,830 --> 00:12:00,280
chimpanzee face we had sculpted into it.
It's pretty bad ass medicine balls.

264
00:12:00,281 --> 00:12:04,270
All those types of things you need for 
strength and conditioning workouts.

265
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:07,180
I'm the type of full body workouts that 
are,

266
00:12:07,181 --> 00:12:12,181
think are the most beneficial as far as 
like application in sports or in your 

267
00:12:12,181 --> 00:12:13,390
everyday life and just picking up shit,
you know,

268
00:12:13,391 --> 00:12:16,330
you don't pick up shit just by curling 
things if you're smart,

269
00:12:16,331 --> 00:12:21,331
use your whole body.
And when you do exercises like 

270
00:12:21,331 --> 00:12:22,180
kettlebells and steel maces and club 
bells,

271
00:12:22,450 --> 00:12:23,170
um,
the,

272
00:12:23,180 --> 00:12:26,170
those are the type of strength and 
fitness,

273
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:31,240
uh,
pieces of equipment that sort of 

274
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:32,671
emphasize those style of workouts,
the style workouts where you use your 

275
00:12:32,671 --> 00:12:35,911
whole body as one unit instead of like 
really breaking things down to like 

276
00:12:35,911 --> 00:12:37,150
isolation exercises,
which,

277
00:12:37,220 --> 00:12:38,740
you know people used to do back in the 
day.

278
00:12:38,950 --> 00:12:40,690
And it's okay if you want to look all 
sex,

279
00:12:42,410 --> 00:12:44,430
you have some sex,
a biceps.

280
00:12:44,620 --> 00:12:46,390
If that's your only goal,
then go,

281
00:12:46,690 --> 00:12:47,590
go,
go,

282
00:12:47,591 --> 00:12:50,770
you fucking sexy Quito.
You do those curls.

283
00:12:50,950 --> 00:12:55,950
Get your,
the back of your triceps on one of 

284
00:12:55,950 --> 00:12:55,950
those,
curling those.

285
00:12:55,950 --> 00:12:55,950
Remember those things,
show ideas,

286
00:12:55,950 --> 00:12:57,400
those preacher curls.
Everybody would do that.

287
00:12:57,401 --> 00:12:59,920
Everybody wanted the big guns to preach 
a curl,

288
00:13:00,190 --> 00:13:05,190
one of the least useful positions.
Do you ever find yourself in double arm 

289
00:13:05,190 --> 00:13:05,380
barred?
Hanging over a couch?

290
00:13:06,900 --> 00:13:11,830
Doing curls anyway,
go to [inaudible] dot com.

291
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:16,120
Use the code name Brogan and save 
yourself some shackles.

292
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:20,140
Joey Coco Diaz is here and we're fixing 
to get busy.

293
00:13:20,230 --> 00:13:25,230
Okay?
Check yourself before you wreck 

294
00:13:25,230 --> 00:13:25,230
yourself.

295
00:13:25,230 --> 00:13:29,670
Big Dixon Yas Day.

296
00:13:37,180 --> 00:13:39,620
Bang son.
We back,

297
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:41,790
we live,
we would,

298
00:13:41,791 --> 00:13:43,150
Joe Diaz,
Joe,

299
00:13:43,210 --> 00:13:47,030
he gave me a pot candy and I got high 
holding in my hand.

300
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:49,170
Okay.
I held it in my hand.

301
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:54,200
I got nervous.
That's the people broke it up into 

302
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:58,900
hybrid sativa and Indica and that is 
even run as easy was saying.

303
00:13:59,151 --> 00:14:02,240
He likes to cheap but shoes,
but he likes to full boat one.

304
00:14:02,241 --> 00:14:07,241
The white label really goes deep.
Death redness there on long island and 

305
00:14:07,611 --> 00:14:12,611
go in and I've had them with coffee in 
the morning before a flight and they 

306
00:14:12,611 --> 00:14:14,060
fucking picked me up.
I will drink energy drinks because I did

307
00:14:14,061 --> 00:14:15,920
blow.
But these things fucking picked me right

308
00:14:15,921 --> 00:14:17,270
up.
So not bad.

309
00:14:17,390 --> 00:14:19,610
This is the,
I gave you the pain relief on to.

310
00:14:19,670 --> 00:14:21,470
Okay.
These guys are going deep.

311
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:22,310
If you,
um,

312
00:14:22,311 --> 00:14:25,700
if you do an energy drink,
it makes you want to do blow.

313
00:14:25,970 --> 00:14:26,240
No,
no,

314
00:14:26,241 --> 00:14:31,241
no.
I did blow for all those years so they 

315
00:14:31,241 --> 00:14:31,241
don't work.
Oh,

316
00:14:31,241 --> 00:14:31,250
fucking red balloon.
Go to sleep.

317
00:14:31,251 --> 00:14:32,930
I drink coffee and go to sleep to be 
honest.

318
00:14:33,140 --> 00:14:35,410
Take you to that too.
I could drink a cup of coffee.

319
00:14:35,430 --> 00:14:37,250
Used to be able to do that when I had 
sleep apnea.

320
00:14:38,510 --> 00:14:41,300
I did fucking just hit the crib right 
after a cup of coffee.

321
00:14:41,930 --> 00:14:43,790
Yeah,
it's amazing.

322
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:47,540
Oh my God.
I need to start a drink to start boxing.

323
00:14:47,570 --> 00:14:50,720
Fucking passed out.
Get the fuck out of Cuban coffee.

324
00:14:50,721 --> 00:14:52,040
Fucks up that

325
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:53,600
uh,
not Persian coffee.

326
00:14:53,601 --> 00:14:55,310
Is that what it is?
Greek coffee.

327
00:14:55,311 --> 00:14:58,150
There's some coffee that's fucking out 
there that the cola,

328
00:14:58,330 --> 00:15:01,700
the caffeine is just outrageous Greek or
one of those countries.

329
00:15:02,290 --> 00:15:05,450
Those coffees that people think are like
really strong.

330
00:15:05,451 --> 00:15:09,140
It's like the taste of it.
It's not necessarily the caffeine like,

331
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:11,950
you know,
I guess out everybody assumes Espresso's

332
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:14,510
like stronger than a cup of coffee.
Not really.

333
00:15:14,570 --> 00:15:15,830
No.
It's actually weaker.

334
00:15:15,831 --> 00:15:20,831
It as less.
The lighter coffees are the ones with 

335
00:15:20,831 --> 00:15:20,960
the more caffeine,
like a dark,

336
00:15:20,961 --> 00:15:23,870
dark coffee.
Apparently a dark coffee doesn't have as

337
00:15:23,871 --> 00:15:28,580
much caffeine as like a lighter coffee.
Oftentimes like when you burn them more,

338
00:15:28,581 --> 00:15:31,100
I guess to make it dark maybe.
Does that make sense?

339
00:15:31,330 --> 00:15:34,340
We roasted it longer.
What am I talking about?

340
00:15:34,341 --> 00:15:39,341
Overhead,
but the first time I ever had Cuban 

341
00:15:39,341 --> 00:15:39,341
coffee,
I'm like,

342
00:15:39,341 --> 00:15:39,341
oh,
this is like everything else Cubans do.

343
00:15:39,590 --> 00:15:41,420
It's crazy.
You take coffee,

344
00:15:41,421 --> 00:15:44,270
you put a half a pound of sugar in it 
from the start.

345
00:15:44,290 --> 00:15:49,290
They make sweets.
I couldn't believe how Sweden as we were

346
00:15:50,421 --> 00:15:52,880
working in Miami at the Improv and 
Joey's like,

347
00:15:52,881 --> 00:15:56,300
you got to try to Cuban coffee dog.
Fuck all that stopped book shit.

348
00:15:57,020 --> 00:16:02,020
That's for girls.
Have you been to Miami International 

349
00:16:02,020 --> 00:16:03,230
Airport and see that starbucks is always
empty.

350
00:16:03,770 --> 00:16:05,660
That's fun and compete because it's a 
quarter.

351
00:16:05,661 --> 00:16:08,400
It's thirty five cents for a shot.
I know 35,000,

352
00:16:08,590 --> 00:16:12,950
85 at the airport and if they give you 
the sugar mixed into it,

353
00:16:12,951 --> 00:16:15,390
you don't even feel guilty for putting 
them a cigarette and uh,

354
00:16:15,430 --> 00:16:16,110
you know,
you're like,

355
00:16:16,130 --> 00:16:17,930
hey,
I asked for.

356
00:16:18,070 --> 00:16:23,070
It's like a dessert.
I didn't know it's a desert and there's 

357
00:16:23,070 --> 00:16:23,720
a little pick me up,
but people think there's more than.

358
00:16:23,721 --> 00:16:28,721
There is apparently a Venti starbucks.
I mean,

359
00:16:28,881 --> 00:16:31,560
you can get more.
Yeah,

360
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:35,300
I think no,
I don't think mountain dew that they put

361
00:16:35,301 --> 00:16:40,301
a bunch of caffeine in a while ago.
Maybe they took it off the market by 

362
00:16:40,301 --> 00:16:40,301
now.

363
00:16:40,301 --> 00:16:42,620
That's the one that made me go to Cedar 
Sinai for having a panic attack.

364
00:16:42,980 --> 00:16:44,810
Yeah,
it was that exact same drink.

365
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:46,670
Mountain dew made you go to the 
hospital.

366
00:16:46,730 --> 00:16:49,130
That was the one where I pulled over on 
the side of the road and they,

367
00:16:49,131 --> 00:16:49,640
they,
they,

368
00:16:49,670 --> 00:16:54,670
they like the.
I sat on the curb with my phone out 

369
00:16:54,670 --> 00:16:55,910
with.
I had nine slash 11 and had one about to

370
00:16:55,911 --> 00:17:00,290
push enter a just because I felt like I 
was having a heart attack.

371
00:17:00,340 --> 00:17:05,340
You feel Brian?
It felt like your heart's going hi to 

372
00:17:05,340 --> 00:17:10,030
know I wasn't high or in high school.
I had not eaten that day but I had one 

373
00:17:10,281 --> 00:17:12,670
of those to wake me up.
Yeah.

374
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:15,000
But it was a big ass.
I mean this was like a,

375
00:17:15,050 --> 00:17:16,700
like a humongous,
like,

376
00:17:17,300 --> 00:17:20,250
like a size of a c too.
Like what is that?

377
00:17:20,320 --> 00:17:24,260
Like 18 hours and then it's like 16 to 
18.

378
00:17:24,261 --> 00:17:25,030
Yeah.
Yeah,

379
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:26,170
but.
But they,

380
00:17:26,230 --> 00:17:28,130
they checked me,
the ambulance checked me like,

381
00:17:28,131 --> 00:17:29,510
dude,
your heart's going crazy.

382
00:17:29,511 --> 00:17:34,511
We need to get you inside.
And then they put a whatever that water 

383
00:17:34,511 --> 00:17:37,640
in your blood is,
because I said I was dehydrated and 

384
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:37,640
stuff.
They give you like an Ivy tripp and they

385
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:39,710
gave me an Ivy Tripp,
but it costs me like $3,000

386
00:17:39,711 --> 00:17:40,910
for this fucking mountain dew.

387
00:17:41,420 --> 00:17:46,420
That's incredible.
Isn't it amazing how much it costs for 

388
00:17:46,420 --> 00:17:46,420
an ambulance to come and just look at it

389
00:17:46,460 --> 00:17:49,680
was $900.
Don't sign the paperwork at the end,

390
00:17:49,681 --> 00:17:50,130
tell them,
run

391
00:17:50,130 --> 00:17:52,750
out of it.
So when they tried

392
00:17:52,980 --> 00:17:54,320
900 bucks.
Okay.

393
00:17:54,630 --> 00:17:56,850
Is it for their time?
Is it

394
00:17:56,860 --> 00:18:01,860
the surface?
It's like most expensive limo in the 

395
00:18:01,860 --> 00:18:01,860
road,
man.

396
00:18:01,860 --> 00:18:04,591
If I was rich I'd be just using 
ambulances cause you can go through 

397
00:18:04,591 --> 00:18:05,530
lights to say you have a heart attack.
I'm just kidding.

398
00:18:05,990 --> 00:18:08,060
Seriously.
That's brilliant.

399
00:18:09,670 --> 00:18:12,010
Brilliant.
That's like a felony.

400
00:18:12,650 --> 00:18:17,650
No felony calling an ambulance,
an ambulance company and you go through 

401
00:18:17,650 --> 00:18:18,070
all the right paperwork and you're like,
you know,

402
00:18:18,071 --> 00:18:19,300
I need to be picked up

403
00:18:19,590 --> 00:18:21,480
dude.
If this wasn't a comedy podcast,

404
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:25,710
just because when you say you probably 
go to jail under the Patriot Act,

405
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:29,010
it was like a crazy,
brilliant wing.

406
00:18:29,190 --> 00:18:34,190
That is brilliant.
So brilliant guy in Long Island right 

407
00:18:34,190 --> 00:18:35,340
now I'm going to open up an ambulance 
company.

408
00:18:36,630 --> 00:18:39,930
I'm going to run dog.
That's brilliant.

409
00:18:40,110 --> 00:18:42,180
And they'll do it till they get fucking 
pulled over.

410
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:46,360
What's going on here and the heart.
Oh good.

411
00:18:46,430 --> 00:18:47,250
No,
no.

412
00:18:47,251 --> 00:18:49,200
I told her if I had the lights I could 
run through.

413
00:18:49,780 --> 00:18:51,340
Well No,
and if you get pulled over,

414
00:18:51,341 --> 00:18:52,850
you're just in the back seat and go,
all right,

415
00:18:52,851 --> 00:18:57,851
stay that.
You're having a panic attack and we'll 

416
00:18:57,851 --> 00:18:57,851
just take it to the hospital.
Well there was a

417
00:18:57,851 --> 00:18:59,890
guy when I lived in Newton,
Massachusetts,

418
00:19:00,130 --> 00:19:02,500
there was a guy who were,
which by the way,

419
00:19:02,501 --> 00:19:04,690
I went back to recently and I couldn't 
believe how

420
00:19:04,860 --> 00:19:06,210
mall it was.
It was really weird.

421
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:11,360
It's weird when you go back home and 
then you realize how small everything 

422
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:12,600
was and you don't know what happened.
Especially like Boston area,

423
00:19:12,601 --> 00:19:14,990
like it was all those little towns.

424
00:19:15,010 --> 00:19:17,350
We're separated by these little two lane
roads.

425
00:19:17,351 --> 00:19:20,140
It's really weird.
It's really weird to go back to it.

426
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:23,390
Um,
I don't forget it.

427
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:25,090
Oh,
you went back home and you,

428
00:19:25,091 --> 00:19:26,870
uh,
you went to Newton?

429
00:19:26,871 --> 00:19:28,190
I don't fucking know either.
Well,

430
00:19:28,820 --> 00:19:30,530
what would you,
what did you say

431
00:19:30,730 --> 00:19:31,240
before that?

432
00:19:32,310 --> 00:19:33,900
But the ambient ambulance,
that guy,

433
00:19:33,980 --> 00:19:35,030
was that sort of A.
Sorry,

434
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:36,470
sorry folks.
A Guy,

435
00:19:36,471 --> 00:19:39,050
um,
was using the ambulance,

436
00:19:39,130 --> 00:19:44,130
like it wasn't going to an emergency.
It's just using it because he wanted to 

437
00:19:44,130 --> 00:19:44,810
get home or whatever you want to do.
Whatever the fuck you wanted to do.

438
00:19:44,840 --> 00:19:48,620
We wanted to go through the slide and he
slammed in this woman and killed her and

439
00:19:48,621 --> 00:19:50,030
it was,
it was bad,

440
00:19:50,230 --> 00:19:52,250
you know,
I mean they wanted him dead.

441
00:19:52,370 --> 00:19:57,370
I remember this like people were,
were fucking really upset that someone 

442
00:19:57,370 --> 00:20:00,730
died because someone abused a public 
thing like that,

443
00:20:00,731 --> 00:20:01,190
that,
you know,

444
00:20:01,191 --> 00:20:02,330
people,
you know,

445
00:20:02,390 --> 00:20:07,390
people expect that if an ambulance is 
coming through it's risking safety 

446
00:20:07,390 --> 00:20:10,391
because trying to save a life.
And this deck was just driving around 

447
00:20:10,391 --> 00:20:10,640
and thought it was cute to run red 
lights.

448
00:20:10,641 --> 00:20:13,390
So I took through.
So you know,

449
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:14,430
slammed into center.

450
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:16,950
I always pull over,
I see p play a cop one,

451
00:20:16,951 --> 00:20:21,951
but three cop cars went by me,
me and maybe two other people pulled it 

452
00:20:21,951 --> 00:20:21,951
over.
That lady,

453
00:20:21,951 --> 00:20:23,500
they don't [inaudible] pull over.
Pull over.

454
00:20:23,850 --> 00:20:24,790
Yeah.
It's scary.

455
00:20:24,791 --> 00:20:25,490
It's scary.
Yeah.

456
00:20:25,580 --> 00:20:30,580
People are dickish man.
They like to wait for other people to 

457
00:20:30,580 --> 00:20:32,590
pull over so they can pull over and 
follow the ambulance and like cut a path

458
00:20:32,591 --> 00:20:33,580
through.
I've seen people do that.

459
00:20:33,610 --> 00:20:33,850
They don't

460
00:20:33,850 --> 00:20:35,620
do it at all out here.
I mean Ohio,

461
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:36,790
everybody,
everybody.

462
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:40,450
I just saw and I'm like,
this is fucking rude.

463
00:20:40,451 --> 00:20:45,451
California.
Some of the worst driving manners I've 

464
00:20:45,451 --> 00:20:45,451
ever,
ever,

465
00:20:45,451 --> 00:20:46,270
ever.
It's so rare.

466
00:20:46,271 --> 00:20:48,010
First of all did ever gets out of the 
fast

467
00:20:48,010 --> 00:20:48,830
lane.
You know,

468
00:20:49,110 --> 00:20:51,580
it's amazing.
When you watch someone in the fast lane,

469
00:20:51,581 --> 00:20:55,270
then you watched someone pull up behind 
them and you see them just sit there and

470
00:20:55,271 --> 00:20:58,900
then the process to go around like they 
look and they know and they know they're

471
00:20:58,901 --> 00:21:01,990
going slow,
they're going 60 get out of the lane.

472
00:21:02,020 --> 00:21:07,020
They don't want to get more info in the 
east coast.

473
00:21:08,261 --> 00:21:10,180
You dealing with these little two lane 
roads,

474
00:21:10,900 --> 00:21:13,990
two lanes on each side,
so everybody who's going slow,

475
00:21:14,050 --> 00:21:18,940
it goes to the fucking right.
You don't want to move to California.

476
00:21:18,941 --> 00:21:23,941
It's like everything else.
It's like such a wealth of lanes out 

477
00:21:23,941 --> 00:21:27,511
here.
There's so many fucking lanes on the 

478
00:21:27,511 --> 00:21:29,371
highway.
The people that gang and yet the name 

479
00:21:29,371 --> 00:21:29,810
man,
u go

480
00:21:34,300 --> 00:21:35,830
check this out.
Have you seen this?

481
00:21:35,860 --> 00:21:38,410
Rethink your drink.
That's just how much sugar is in each.

482
00:21:38,470 --> 00:21:40,300
A different kind of drink?
I think it is.

483
00:21:40,390 --> 00:21:41,890
Oh my God.
Look at red bull.

484
00:21:41,980 --> 00:21:44,710
Holy Fuck.
Is that real or is that caffeine?

485
00:21:45,510 --> 00:21:47,200
Caffeine.
That's sugar.

486
00:21:47,290 --> 00:21:49,950
Oh my God.
Look how much sugar's in red bull.

487
00:21:51,850 --> 00:21:56,850
That's insane.
The same as that small mountain dew 

488
00:21:56,850 --> 00:21:56,850
though.
It is,

489
00:21:56,850 --> 00:21:56,920
right?
Oh my God.

490
00:21:56,921 --> 00:21:58,720
I didn't even a regular size mountain 
dew it looks like.

491
00:21:58,990 --> 00:22:00,160
And you know what?
Here's the other thing.

492
00:22:00,161 --> 00:22:05,161
It'd be better if it was actually sugar 
in there and that was their sugar in 

493
00:22:05,161 --> 00:22:05,161
water.
Is that what that is?

494
00:22:05,161 --> 00:22:06,490
This thing.
Fucking water.

495
00:22:06,491 --> 00:22:08,170
Bottled water.
How's that possible now?

496
00:22:08,350 --> 00:22:10,060
True.
Zero,

497
00:22:10,910 --> 00:22:12,680
but show zero.
Red Kool aid.

498
00:22:13,260 --> 00:22:15,520
I think that's just a refresh.
I think that's just a reflection.

499
00:22:16,620 --> 00:22:18,360
Yeah.
Yeah.

500
00:22:19,180 --> 00:22:21,310
Right.
It's trying to get you to drink water,

501
00:22:21,311 --> 00:22:21,790
obviously.

502
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:25,180
Yeah.
You mean that little packet of Koolaid.

503
00:22:25,420 --> 00:22:30,420
That's ridiculous.
That's the same amount as a little 

504
00:22:30,420 --> 00:22:30,420
weight.
Chocolate milk.

505
00:22:30,420 --> 00:22:30,420
That's crazy.
Yeah.

506
00:22:30,420 --> 00:22:32,200
There's a lot of sugar in our lives 
folks.

507
00:22:32,230 --> 00:22:34,440
We're kind of hooked on that.
Yeah.

508
00:22:34,450 --> 00:22:39,220
I'm trying not to drink coffee right now
and I've been drinking this Trenta sized

509
00:22:39,340 --> 00:22:42,940
passion fruit ice tea everyday.
It has no caffeine in it,

510
00:22:43,180 --> 00:22:46,690
but I don't get the sweetener in it and 
I get splenda and that's just.

511
00:22:47,320 --> 00:22:48,770
Yeah,
but it's got to give you brain cancer,

512
00:22:48,771 --> 00:22:52,480
but the night much splenda that drinking
that much Stevia go with the Stevia,

513
00:22:52,710 --> 00:22:56,500
but starbucks doesn't have Stevia for 
someone home.

514
00:22:57,020 --> 00:22:59,320
She got a gang of him here.
Why don't you.

515
00:22:59,350 --> 00:23:01,300
Why don't you think starbucks goes on,
Steve,

516
00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:01,990
too expensive.

517
00:23:02,140 --> 00:23:07,140
I don't know.
Maybe they have a deal with splenda to 

518
00:23:07,140 --> 00:23:07,570
keep people from knowing about Steve.
Yeah.

519
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:11,860
Suppressing knowledge.
Dog suppressing that herbal goodness.

520
00:23:12,250 --> 00:23:13,960
Stevie is delicious.
I.

521
00:23:13,961 --> 00:23:15,610
It took me a little while to get used to
it,

522
00:23:15,611 --> 00:23:20,611
but knowing that it's an herbal 
sweetener and then if there's like 

523
00:23:20,611 --> 00:23:23,500
literally no strings attached,
it's just your body takes it in.

524
00:23:23,620 --> 00:23:26,680
It doesn't seem to have any.
My talent truth as it seemed to have any

525
00:23:26,710 --> 00:23:27,190
health

526
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,880
very recently.
I heard some stuff in that.

527
00:23:30,050 --> 00:23:32,330
That's why people were telling me to go 
to something else.

528
00:23:32,331 --> 00:23:36,380
That other one,
it's like with x or aZ or a Xavier.

529
00:23:36,520 --> 00:23:38,290
Oh,
xylitol salad part.

530
00:23:39,370 --> 00:23:42,220
I've heard that as well.
Like some people like the Xylitol.

531
00:23:42,370 --> 00:23:45,060
There was a reason that people were 
saying something recently about Stevia.

532
00:23:45,100 --> 00:23:46,100
Maybe I'm wrong.
Okay,

533
00:23:46,100 --> 00:23:47,030
well let's go.
Go,

534
00:23:47,031 --> 00:23:48,510
go.
What's wrong with Stevia?

535
00:23:48,590 --> 00:23:51,170
What do you do Joe Ago?
Straight stab.

536
00:23:51,171 --> 00:23:53,210
A little Stevie at the House that rob 
gave me.

537
00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:58,000
I have the blue packages.
I like it because it's super strong.

538
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:03,240
I have sugar too,
which I don't use every once in a while 

539
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:03,240
with the new coffee machine.
I'll.

540
00:24:03,290 --> 00:24:07,100
I'll make a Cuban coffee,
but you know what's crazy dog?

541
00:24:07,610 --> 00:24:12,610
The biggest addiction I ever had was to 
Coca Cola and with the weight watchers I

542
00:24:12,741 --> 00:24:17,741
stopped drinking soda and it was like 
the toughest three months of my fucking 

543
00:24:17,741 --> 00:24:17,741
life.
God is like,

544
00:24:17,741 --> 00:24:19,340
I thought it was worse than getting off 
the blow,

545
00:24:19,700 --> 00:24:22,070
not having like Chinese food or 
something with a coat.

546
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:24,160
The other day.
I had,

547
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:26,000
I went to someplace to eat and the guy 
goes,

548
00:24:26,001 --> 00:24:27,320
we're out of diet coke.
I said,

549
00:24:27,321 --> 00:24:28,940
you know what,
give me a coat.

550
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:32,120
It was fucking horrible.
It's too sugary.

551
00:24:32,210 --> 00:24:34,190
Oh my God.
Ridiculous.

552
00:24:34,310 --> 00:24:36,650
Oh my fucking God.
That was terrible

553
00:24:36,680 --> 00:24:41,680
sweat.
This stevie is used as a weight loss 

554
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:41,680
aid.
It's used for treating diabetes,

555
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:46,421
high blood pressure and heartburn for 
lowering uric acid levels and for 

556
00:24:46,421 --> 00:24:51,311
preventing pregnancy.
Also for increasing the strength of the 

557
00:24:51,311 --> 00:24:53,630
muscle contractions that pump blood from
the heart.

558
00:24:54,260 --> 00:24:55,580
Wow.
Yeah.

559
00:24:56,750 --> 00:24:58,520
That doesn't seem like you could eat 
that all day.

560
00:25:00,570 --> 00:25:02,930
It seems like.
It seems like if you ate that all day,

561
00:25:02,931 --> 00:25:04,900
you'd have some fucking issues.
I mean,

562
00:25:04,910 --> 00:25:09,910
maybe we should talk to tate.
He could be our patient zero because 

563
00:25:09,910 --> 00:25:10,550
that dude's got stevie and his system 
all day.

564
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:13,550
He just drinks those mugs.
Have bulletproof coffee.

565
00:25:14,060 --> 00:25:19,060
I should give a plug to tate too,
because tate just started his own a 

566
00:25:19,070 --> 00:25:24,070
mobile coffee business.
He's doing a butter coffee truck and 

567
00:25:24,921 --> 00:25:26,330
they um,
they,

568
00:25:26,390 --> 00:25:28,700
I guess they roll around.
It's called rolling butter.

569
00:25:28,730 --> 00:25:33,730
It's rolling underscore butter on 
twitter and he's got like a butter 

570
00:25:33,730 --> 00:25:37,841
coffee truck,
all sorts of different flavors and shit 

571
00:25:37,841 --> 00:25:39,590
and he shows up at crossfit events.
Those crossfit guys are junkies for that

572
00:25:39,591 --> 00:25:44,591
butter coffee,
like bulletproof coffee with mct oil in 

573
00:25:44,591 --> 00:25:48,131
it.
So tate decided to set up a truck and 

574
00:25:48,131 --> 00:25:48,131
just roll around and had his first event
this week.

575
00:25:48,440 --> 00:25:52,460
So you need to go to the arnold classic.
Oh yeah.

576
00:25:52,461 --> 00:25:57,461
But the last thing you want to do is 
take a fucking truck all the way to 

577
00:25:57,461 --> 00:25:57,680
Ohio,
especially in March,

578
00:25:58,160 --> 00:25:59,750
in March in Ohio,
son,

579
00:25:59,780 --> 00:26:03,230
you might get fucked.
That shit my go ugly on you.

580
00:26:03,290 --> 00:26:05,990
It could easily snow like a bitch and 
March,

581
00:26:05,991 --> 00:26:06,260
right?

582
00:26:06,330 --> 00:26:07,200
Yeah.
Oh yeah.

583
00:26:07,850 --> 00:26:09,240
It's risky.
In March,

584
00:26:09,460 --> 00:26:14,460
remember that time back when you were 
making the videos were that one dude 

585
00:26:14,460 --> 00:26:18,190
was.
He took his shirt off and you made a 

586
00:26:18,190 --> 00:26:19,921
video about it.
Like he took his shirt off in the 

587
00:26:19,921 --> 00:26:19,921
audience,
dancing around.

588
00:26:19,921 --> 00:26:24,690
Remember that guy who was hammered and 
then he gave me a big hug and then he 

589
00:26:24,690 --> 00:26:29,240
was so ridiculously hammered and then 
after the show we found them in the 

590
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:31,030
parking lot,
blood all over his face,

591
00:26:31,180 --> 00:26:33,970
no shirt on,
somebody beat the shit out of him and it

592
00:26:33,971 --> 00:26:36,010
was like zero degrees out or like,
wow,

593
00:26:36,290 --> 00:26:37,320
hey,
take care buddy.

594
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:42,680
Get in the car.
Like that's a fucking normal Friday 

595
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:42,910
night for that dude would probably 
totally

596
00:26:45,830 --> 00:26:50,830
as they're telling you the story,
they pulled the 2000 fucking hit me with

597
00:26:51,751 --> 00:26:53,350
a bat.
Oh fuck,

598
00:26:54,110 --> 00:26:55,890
fuck.
He ain't,

599
00:26:56,690 --> 00:26:59,550
you got any ice on your extra batteries?
Extra jacket.

600
00:27:00,140 --> 00:27:05,140
What the Fuck Guy?
I'll tell you what that show Friday 

601
00:27:05,140 --> 00:27:07,500
night that we did was uh,
I was a nice place.

602
00:27:07,501 --> 00:27:09,030
I had never been the joint.
Yeah,

603
00:27:09,031 --> 00:27:12,450
that was great.
To join the audience was amazing.

604
00:27:13,080 --> 00:27:15,630
You know,
the audiences we've been getting lately,

605
00:27:15,631 --> 00:27:18,180
it's just off the charts.
They're so happy.

606
00:27:18,420 --> 00:27:21,030
It's like such a friendly,
happy group.

607
00:27:21,280 --> 00:27:23,280
Like overwhelmingly.
It's amazing.

608
00:27:23,281 --> 00:27:25,530
I don't know how we ever pulled it off,
but it's amazing.

609
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:28,290
And the joint was probably one of the 
best ones yet.

610
00:27:28,620 --> 00:27:30,570
It's one of the best crowds ever.
It was amazing.

611
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:35,600
It was just.
Everybody's so fine with that bar was 

612
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:35,600
great.
Great time.

613
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:37,610
Joey and I went to that center bar and 
uh,

614
00:27:37,680 --> 00:27:42,680
we held court for like three hours,
three hours just hanging around talking 

615
00:27:42,680 --> 00:27:42,680
to people,
you know.

616
00:27:42,810 --> 00:27:44,320
We uh,
Max are.

617
00:27:44,321 --> 00:27:47,320
He got too drunk to see Max drunk Max 
everly,

618
00:27:49,090 --> 00:27:53,730
Asians,
Asian Jersey girl.

619
00:27:54,360 --> 00:27:56,130
She was half Asian,
half Irish.

620
00:27:56,131 --> 00:27:57,750
He was torturing her.
Well,

621
00:27:58,070 --> 00:28:01,510
he'll torture your mom.
Foster with Jack.

622
00:28:02,570 --> 00:28:04,110
He's done.
He's a great guy.

623
00:28:04,111 --> 00:28:06,150
That was zooming over.
Yeah.

624
00:28:06,180 --> 00:28:07,340
We had an awesome time.
It was,

625
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:07,920
it was,
uh,

626
00:28:08,100 --> 00:28:08,810
it was,
you know what,

627
00:28:08,820 --> 00:28:10,860
it was like a,
there was a lot of good vibes.

628
00:28:11,450 --> 00:28:16,450
Nice.
I took the limo over to the fucking 

629
00:28:16,450 --> 00:28:16,780
South Pole.
You did another show after that 30.

630
00:28:16,790 --> 00:28:19,500
That was j dot Davis was there.
Jason Rouse was there.

631
00:28:19,940 --> 00:28:21,570
And what's the light show,
bro?

632
00:28:21,870 --> 00:28:24,930
It was mind boggling,
like thinking of doing the weekend.

633
00:28:24,931 --> 00:28:29,931
They're like,
oh my calling in August and go give me 

634
00:28:29,931 --> 00:28:30,120
the 1230 at 1230.
Wow.

635
00:28:30,121 --> 00:28:35,121
It was good.
It was in a way is what's going on that 

636
00:28:35,121 --> 00:28:36,010
all these comics work like bobby columns
is that right?

637
00:28:36,150 --> 00:28:38,250
Becomes 10.
Some other girl did 10.

638
00:28:38,550 --> 00:28:42,110
It was smooth and so there's like a 
bunch of real common.

639
00:28:42,150 --> 00:28:44,010
Oh my God,
there had to be 2:50,

640
00:28:44,430 --> 00:28:49,430
one to 50 and what was the locals and 
lose what they were telling me,

641
00:28:49,921 --> 00:28:52,440
like people coming back with drinks like
people felt.

642
00:28:52,520 --> 00:28:57,520
Let me tell you something.
I went over there and had to be 150 

643
00:28:57,520 --> 00:29:00,591
people from the joint show.
No showed up with tickets for me to 

644
00:29:00,591 --> 00:29:04,161
sign,
but we told them you were going to go 

645
00:29:04,161 --> 00:29:04,161
going,
listen man,

646
00:29:04,161 --> 00:29:07,320
this is fucking amazing.
I just got for cocktails made $17.

647
00:29:07,590 --> 00:29:09,800
It didn't.
We announced it on stage that you did.

648
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:11,850
Was drinking something?
Something was going on.

649
00:29:11,851 --> 00:29:13,100
I didn't know.
I didn't know for sure.

650
00:29:13,110 --> 00:29:13,650
People like,
Hey,

651
00:29:13,651 --> 00:29:16,150
you going to be at the south point yet?
Went over that Cj,

652
00:29:16,190 --> 00:29:21,190
Jay Davis.
She got a bunch of comics I hadn't seen 

653
00:29:21,190 --> 00:29:21,190
that.
Just hang out and drink it.

654
00:29:21,190 --> 00:29:21,300
Well,
we should do that when we're in town,

655
00:29:21,301 --> 00:29:26,301
like in between every Friday,
every Friday at 1237.

656
00:29:26,920 --> 00:29:31,920
I don't know where it was asking if you 
guys are going to go stop by because 

657
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:35,191
they,
I guess they had a show at the other 

658
00:29:35,191 --> 00:29:36,421
club at the hard rock the same night.
A vinyl at the other hard rock or 

659
00:29:36,421 --> 00:29:36,790
Illinois and diced dyson.
Yeah,

660
00:29:37,540 --> 00:29:42,540
that's hilarious though.
So they were in the same places us and 

661
00:29:42,540 --> 00:29:42,540
they seeing if you want it to

662
00:29:42,540 --> 00:29:43,990
before or after.
I think it was before,

663
00:29:44,040 --> 00:29:46,690
but he was apparently his son was 
playing.

664
00:29:46,870 --> 00:29:50,410
He wanted us to come watch the son's 
band after my show.

665
00:29:50,710 --> 00:29:51,490
But you,
we,

666
00:29:51,491 --> 00:29:53,640
you know,
we got mobbed by people and it was,

667
00:29:53,650 --> 00:29:54,280
we had a,
you know,

668
00:29:54,340 --> 00:29:57,580
Justin was with us so it's friends.
So um,

669
00:29:57,760 --> 00:29:59,290
he's there like every weekend,
right.

670
00:29:59,590 --> 00:30:01,480
I think for awhile or something like 
that.

671
00:30:02,830 --> 00:30:06,240
Both Amazing Papa bicycling many comics 
with them.

672
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:09,010
Like a lot of guys came up and say hello
to Joe.

673
00:30:09,011 --> 00:30:10,900
Come on guys.
I recognize I didn't,

674
00:30:11,080 --> 00:30:12,680
I didn't know their names.
Well,

675
00:30:12,681 --> 00:30:16,330
you know what,
if Vegas was was really smoothly run,

676
00:30:16,660 --> 00:30:18,850
there would be a real comedy scene 
there.

677
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:20,440
I mean it doesn't make sense.
It wouldn't be.

678
00:30:20,620 --> 00:30:23,980
You're dealing with all these tourists 
that are coming in from out of town on a

679
00:30:23,981 --> 00:30:26,950
regular basis.
It doesn't have to be on the strip.

680
00:30:26,950 --> 00:30:30,220
If you have one good spot,
like think of like that steak joint,

681
00:30:30,221 --> 00:30:35,221
that Brazilian place.
We go to Texas de Brazil with the True 

682
00:30:35,221 --> 00:30:35,640
House Korea.
That's nowhere near the strip.

683
00:30:35,730 --> 00:30:37,960
It's way the fuck out there.
It's somewhere in another,

684
00:30:37,961 --> 00:30:42,961
you know,
part of it's not near the casinos but 

685
00:30:42,961 --> 00:30:45,630
everybody goes there.
Everybody goes there because it's good 

686
00:30:45,630 --> 00:30:45,630
because they know it's there and it's 
good.

687
00:30:45,630 --> 00:30:47,200
And you know,
there's people in town in Vegas that are

688
00:30:47,201 --> 00:30:52,201
always looking to do something.
I know the casinos would like to keep 

689
00:30:52,201 --> 00:30:54,960
the shows in the casinos and it's great 
to do the joint man.

690
00:30:54,980 --> 00:30:56,860
We had a.
That was perfect for us.

691
00:30:57,100 --> 00:31:02,100
But like for like the local comics,
like there should be a few comedy clubs 

692
00:31:02,100 --> 00:31:03,640
in Vegas.
It seems like you could have like a real

693
00:31:03,641 --> 00:31:06,850
local scene in vegas.
I can't believe this is embarrassing.

694
00:31:06,851 --> 00:31:08,450
This is.
I hate to say this because people didn't

695
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:08,780
pick up.

696
00:31:09,340 --> 00:31:14,340
We walked past bread.
It's like we ain't going to break down.

697
00:31:14,920 --> 00:31:18,500
Nobody goes.
We're not going because they don't know.

698
00:31:18,520 --> 00:31:23,520
No,
I shouldn't say that because not Dunkin 

699
00:31:23,520 --> 00:31:23,520
does.
And he likes it.

700
00:31:23,520 --> 00:31:23,920
Yeah,
that's why.

701
00:31:23,921 --> 00:31:25,530
But it's like they'll never quite.
I don't wiggle.

702
00:31:25,570 --> 00:31:26,950
It was because we're too dirty.
Is that what it is?

703
00:31:26,970 --> 00:31:31,970
I don't know.
I think that he just likes a certain 

704
00:31:31,970 --> 00:31:33,871
style and you know,
I think Adam Hunter did it and he liked 

705
00:31:33,871 --> 00:31:33,871
it.
He asked me,

706
00:31:33,871 --> 00:31:35,050
but you know,
when I see it I'm like,

707
00:31:35,280 --> 00:31:36,440
oh,
I never even thinking.

708
00:31:36,490 --> 00:31:41,490
I always assumed that I'm to do.
And then the La Dee la comedy club hit 

709
00:31:41,490 --> 00:31:45,271
me up when I was in Vegas and if we 
wanted to go over there late at night 

710
00:31:45,271 --> 00:31:45,310
and do a spot.
You know the La Comedy Club?

711
00:31:45,340 --> 00:31:47,680
It's at bally's I guess.
So there is a few comments.

712
00:31:48,920 --> 00:31:51,910
A lot of them have like would they have 
like Roseanne Barr there every,

713
00:31:52,150 --> 00:31:54,580
every Roseanne bought it.

714
00:31:54,760 --> 00:31:56,050
Okay.
Let me ask you this,

715
00:31:56,110 --> 00:32:01,110
how does that work?
How does someone do like the same town 

716
00:32:01,110 --> 00:32:01,180
every night,
like five,

717
00:32:01,190 --> 00:32:03,070
six nights a week?
Vegas for years.

718
00:32:03,080 --> 00:32:04,920
It shows up on Monday we had to have new
people,

719
00:32:05,500 --> 00:32:07,990
new people,
but how do you not go crazy because it's

720
00:32:07,991 --> 00:32:10,790
fucking vegas and has the hottest shit 
going on all day.

721
00:32:10,830 --> 00:32:12,190
It's like the best party,
you know?

722
00:32:12,310 --> 00:32:12,880
Yeah.
Yeah.

723
00:32:12,881 --> 00:32:14,950
But let me talk some best food.
Sweetie Pie.

724
00:32:15,190 --> 00:32:20,190
If you lived there,
it's very likely you might lose your 

725
00:32:20,190 --> 00:32:20,190
mind.
Vegas has God.

726
00:32:20,190 --> 00:32:21,520
There's A.
There's a void in that town.

727
00:32:21,790 --> 00:32:26,790
You know,
there's a lot of good people that live 

728
00:32:26,790 --> 00:32:26,790
in Vegas and there's a lot of fun in 
Vegas,

729
00:32:26,790 --> 00:32:28,660
but this is the devil lives in Vegas,
you know,

730
00:32:28,661 --> 00:32:31,520
he does.
We all know he does it.

731
00:32:31,590 --> 00:32:33,550
If you live there,
if you were there,

732
00:32:33,551 --> 00:32:34,840
you lived there.
Woo.

733
00:32:34,841 --> 00:32:38,650
I don't know.
Brian has the baddest bitches.

734
00:32:38,750 --> 00:32:39,770
Listen,
I'm 50 years.

735
00:32:39,830 --> 00:32:40,010
A lot

736
00:32:40,010 --> 00:32:41,570
of fun in Vegas.
She is.

737
00:32:41,571 --> 00:32:43,370
I'm still alive.
I might want to go to Vegas.

738
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:44,560
You know,
you get older.

739
00:32:44,561 --> 00:32:46,280
You do.
You want to do Monday through Saturday?

740
00:32:46,281 --> 00:32:47,990
First of all,
I wouldn't stay in the casino,

741
00:32:47,991 --> 00:32:49,850
Joel.
Of course I live 45 minutes.

742
00:32:49,950 --> 00:32:53,720
I would not be my life at all,
but like when I heard Roseanne Barr,

743
00:32:54,140 --> 00:32:55,180
she's doing.
Yeah.

744
00:32:55,220 --> 00:32:56,430
She lives in Vegas now.
No,

745
00:32:56,480 --> 00:32:59,270
I guess you commute to stays.
I don't know what to day a week.

746
00:32:59,670 --> 00:33:01,100
She does the whole week.
Virginia Masada,

747
00:33:01,310 --> 00:33:03,890
the whole week Monday crew.
She does the 8:00

748
00:33:03,891 --> 00:33:07,460
show.
Then one clocks on a lineup comes in and

749
00:33:07,461 --> 00:33:12,461
they do it.
So a lot of people like that do just 

750
00:33:12,461 --> 00:33:13,070
change it to 10.
You know.

751
00:33:13,071 --> 00:33:18,071
Bobby couldn't make it work.
It takes a certain comment to make it 

752
00:33:18,071 --> 00:33:18,730
work.
The hotel has to get behind you.

753
00:33:19,250 --> 00:33:20,960
They just say what it used to be dog.

754
00:33:21,230 --> 00:33:26,230
It's not like I read an article at the 
UFC brings how much money per weekend 

755
00:33:26,230 --> 00:33:27,740
when there's a vegas and went to a 
million dollars.

756
00:33:27,890 --> 00:33:29,840
I wrote a management and it's like,
wow.

757
00:33:29,870 --> 00:33:31,100
Yeah,
I see it.

758
00:33:31,101 --> 00:33:36,101
I see the fucking concessions.
You the cheerleading competition from 

759
00:33:36,101 --> 00:33:37,430
Ogallala,
Nebraska and that type of stuff.

760
00:33:37,460 --> 00:33:38,860
This is the new website.
Yeah.

761
00:33:38,861 --> 00:33:42,140
That's one of the reasons why it's so 
disgusting that it's illegal in New York

762
00:33:42,170 --> 00:33:45,350
because they would make so much money 
from having a UFC there.

763
00:33:45,351 --> 00:33:48,230
It would generate so much revenue for 
the city.

764
00:33:48,231 --> 00:33:53,231
It would be fantastic and the fact that 
these dirty unions have kept it out for 

765
00:33:53,231 --> 00:33:57,520
for that long.
It's really kind of tackle UFC at 

766
00:33:57,520 --> 00:34:00,491
Madison Square Garden.
Just close your fucking eyes for five 

767
00:34:00,491 --> 00:34:03,280
fucking minutes on my palms.
First we get a steak with lobster on it 

768
00:34:03,280 --> 00:34:04,310
or some shit.
A lobster fucking bisque.

769
00:34:04,570 --> 00:34:06,490
How Salad we shoot over.

770
00:34:06,770 --> 00:34:10,030
Are you kidding me?
A wedge from Brooklyn.

771
00:34:10,040 --> 00:34:12,380
We get out of that motherfucking UFC 
11:00

772
00:34:12,510 --> 00:34:16,240
because the UFC ends at one and we'd be 
walking out of the garden.

773
00:34:16,241 --> 00:34:21,241
That one fucking 30.
It's like walking into your oyster 

774
00:34:21,241 --> 00:34:22,970
oyster of life.
You know how everything is open.

775
00:34:22,971 --> 00:34:27,971
You get everything.
You get Chinese cube and you get to 

776
00:34:27,971 --> 00:34:27,971
county in the Bronx,
you get fucking school,

777
00:34:27,971 --> 00:34:32,151
Geo Salad.
You can get whatever the fuck you want 

778
00:34:32,151 --> 00:34:32,151
at 1:30
in the morning.

779
00:34:32,151 --> 00:34:32,450
We don't have to go get a state.
We'd go to China town.

780
00:34:32,620 --> 00:34:35,870
We've got a really a clam sauce.
How many spots are there in la where you

781
00:34:35,871 --> 00:34:37,460
could pull that off?
There's one in the morning.

782
00:34:37,480 --> 00:34:40,940
It was a few of the standard Dantanna's 
Dan.

783
00:34:41,120 --> 00:34:43,220
Dan,
Dan is open till two Dantanna's up until

784
00:34:43,221 --> 00:34:45,080
two.
They serve two to believe they do.

785
00:34:45,170 --> 00:34:50,170
That's a pretty sure I got a stake there
and no one night after the comedy store 

786
00:34:50,170 --> 00:34:50,180
it really late and it was God damn 
delicious.

787
00:34:50,540 --> 00:34:55,540
Delicious with the side of stuff.
So good googling Dantanna's just like 

788
00:34:55,540 --> 00:34:59,411
one of those legit old school 
restaurants from the East Coast that 

789
00:34:59,411 --> 00:35:03,590
exists in California somehow or another,
and it's just very few places like that.

790
00:35:03,591 --> 00:35:07,140
I'm going to tell you where they're 
going to Micah Boulevard.

791
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:08,900
It's sensational.
Oh my God.

792
00:35:09,700 --> 00:35:11,720
I just was at the spot a couple of weeks
ago.

793
00:35:11,900 --> 00:35:14,420
One of my favorite clubs in the country,
the San Jose Improv,

794
00:35:14,750 --> 00:35:17,390
and it's a lovely place.
It's down the block from the hotel.

795
00:35:17,450 --> 00:35:22,450
Everything's Joe.
You got motherfuckers tell us for lunch 

796
00:35:22,450 --> 00:35:26,260
and you go in there.
You get the house salad with the 

797
00:35:26,260 --> 00:35:28,241
spaghetti meat.
I can't even eat the meat bones saucers 

798
00:35:28,241 --> 00:35:30,820
no more because I get so scared.
I just get the fucking regular rat 

799
00:35:30,820 --> 00:35:31,580
Gustavo's now.
No bread,

800
00:35:31,581 --> 00:35:33,260
no butter.
And the house salad,

801
00:35:33,290 --> 00:35:37,160
they took a fucking hell of a steak too.
They got a char grill grill.

802
00:35:37,380 --> 00:35:38,130
Charcoal Grill.

803
00:35:38,220 --> 00:35:43,220
They use real wood charcoal.
They don't fuck around with those 

804
00:35:43,220 --> 00:35:46,260
fucking Tuxedos.
Original Joe's is 80 motherfucking five.

805
00:35:46,261 --> 00:35:48,390
And the tablet really when you.
Not that one.

806
00:35:48,391 --> 00:35:50,700
The tenderloin when never been to that 
one.

807
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:51,600
Oh,
this was good.

808
00:35:51,640 --> 00:35:56,640
I just broke down.
They Jewish lightning that something 

809
00:35:56,640 --> 00:35:57,320
happened with cap back open.
Something happened.

810
00:35:57,330 --> 00:35:59,700
I don't know.
I did San Francisco last week.

811
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:01,470
I was in town.
Tremendous.

812
00:36:02,460 --> 00:36:05,080
Tremendous food there.
You loved that one girl.

813
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:07,290
Every time we go,
you take me to that Hillary Pasta.

814
00:36:07,780 --> 00:36:09,510
Columbia go nuts.
Yeah.

815
00:36:09,740 --> 00:36:14,740
That cal zones.
Columbus shows too.

816
00:36:15,650 --> 00:36:16,770
We filled it.
And that's another,

817
00:36:16,771 --> 00:36:17,730
that's a legit place.
Yeah.

818
00:36:17,750 --> 00:36:22,750
That's a legit place.
There's another place down the street 

819
00:36:22,750 --> 00:36:22,790
where it got that video of uh,
uh,

820
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:24,540
Tommy buttons.
He was dancing.

821
00:36:24,570 --> 00:36:27,300
So was dancing to music and you came in.
It was you,

822
00:36:27,350 --> 00:36:28,500
me mean secure.
Remember that?

823
00:36:29,230 --> 00:36:30,940
What's that Asian place?
So that we go to that?

824
00:36:31,770 --> 00:36:32,700
Yeah,
with denny.

825
00:36:32,760 --> 00:36:33,770
Yeah,
that's a,

826
00:36:34,020 --> 00:36:37,320
well it's Kinda like a sketchy area 
where we went outside.

827
00:36:37,321 --> 00:36:39,530
We had some Asian food after the show 
and uh,

828
00:36:39,600 --> 00:36:44,600
as we left,
we went outside the door and they had a 

829
00:36:44,600 --> 00:36:45,270
aquarium drive by,
filled with strippers.

830
00:36:45,380 --> 00:36:48,840
Let's remember that we got a video of 
the truck.

831
00:36:48,841 --> 00:36:50,810
It's on youtube somewhere.
Um,

832
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:52,370
this,
this truck pulled up.

833
00:36:52,371 --> 00:36:57,371
We were like,
this is the craziest thing I've ever 

834
00:36:57,371 --> 00:36:59,451
seen in my life.
And the cops would pull up aside and me 

835
00:36:59,451 --> 00:36:59,451
hit the lights,
tell everybody,

836
00:36:59,451 --> 00:36:59,880
sit down,
sit down.

837
00:37:00,090 --> 00:37:01,950
Because they're only allowed to dance 
when the,

838
00:37:02,200 --> 00:37:07,200
when the truck's not moving.
So they had seat belts they would have 

839
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:10,131
to wear.
So it's like a pole and just like some 

840
00:37:10,131 --> 00:37:10,990
seats and like little tiny seats with 
seat belts.

841
00:37:10,991 --> 00:37:13,140
And the fucking cops would pull up and 
hit the lights,

842
00:37:13,141 --> 00:37:18,141
go a pseudo this girls dancing on a pole
on the back of a fucking man.

843
00:37:18,660 --> 00:37:22,140
And all I could think of was imagining 
life from their eyes.

844
00:37:22,500 --> 00:37:27,500
You're,
you're naked and you're just driving 

845
00:37:27,500 --> 00:37:28,060
around like bait,
like you're like,

846
00:37:28,090 --> 00:37:33,090
like they're chumming,
they're chumming the whole city to try 

847
00:37:33,090 --> 00:37:36,180
to get them into this club and they're 
doing it by putting bait in a box.

848
00:37:36,630 --> 00:37:41,630
Like that's what people had been reduced
to like a woman in the smallest amount 

849
00:37:42,331 --> 00:37:45,960
of clothes legally possible with 
ridiculous shoes that,

850
00:37:45,961 --> 00:37:48,870
you know,
she can't run good end and she's dancing

851
00:37:48,871 --> 00:37:51,480
around on a poll asking you to come with
her.

852
00:37:52,140 --> 00:37:54,390
It's crazy.
It's ridiculous.

853
00:37:56,280 --> 00:37:57,930
Fucking fish tank full of checks.

854
00:37:58,270 --> 00:38:03,270
Oh yeah.
I went to the playboy mansion and I got 

855
00:38:03,270 --> 00:38:03,490
to see all his rare birds and they have 
like,

856
00:38:03,580 --> 00:38:08,580
he has,
he's like the largest collector of rare 

857
00:38:08,580 --> 00:38:08,580
birds ever.
Really?

858
00:38:08,580 --> 00:38:08,580
Yeah.
And,

859
00:38:08,620 --> 00:38:10,720
and you walk in,
I don't know if it's the number one,

860
00:38:10,721 --> 00:38:12,910
but maybe in California or whatever,
whatever,

861
00:38:14,620 --> 00:38:19,620
but when you walk in,
there's these birds there that don't 

862
00:38:19,620 --> 00:38:19,620
even look like real birds.
Like I was saying,

863
00:38:19,620 --> 00:38:21,130
thinking like,
I haven't even seen that before,

864
00:38:21,131 --> 00:38:24,820
like in a book or a magazine or on TV.
So when you saw it in person,

865
00:38:24,821 --> 00:38:27,490
it just seemed like it was fake.
It was so awesome.

866
00:38:27,491 --> 00:38:29,860
He has the coolest animals,
like monkeys,

867
00:38:29,890 --> 00:38:34,890
collections that I've ever seen.
Here's these monkeys that look like old 

868
00:38:34,890 --> 00:38:37,771
men that just come up and to go out and 
have these beards and like these 

869
00:38:37,771 --> 00:38:37,771
mustache and look like,
like,

870
00:38:37,771 --> 00:38:41,170
like Samurais freak you out that they 
are locked in a little cage?

871
00:38:41,750 --> 00:38:43,750
No,
because they're humongous cages.

872
00:38:43,780 --> 00:38:48,780
Like,
like it was like having a cage be like 

873
00:38:48,780 --> 00:38:50,090
the size of like a football field.
How many acres is that dude have out.

874
00:38:50,140 --> 00:38:52,690
It was a lot because I got like the full
tour.

875
00:38:52,691 --> 00:38:54,480
Like most times you go to the playboy 
mansion,

876
00:38:54,500 --> 00:38:55,030
you have like,
look,

877
00:38:55,120 --> 00:38:58,030
they're sectioned off and you're like at
a small piece of it.

878
00:38:58,410 --> 00:39:01,030
I was there with friends with a family.
The girl I was with,

879
00:39:01,031 --> 00:39:03,880
her mom was married to hue in the 
seventies and so she's just like,

880
00:39:03,881 --> 00:39:05,280
let me show you around.
So,

881
00:39:05,470 --> 00:39:08,560
so I got to go.
I don't even think I saw it all.

882
00:39:08,590 --> 00:39:13,590
I mean I walk for long periods of times 
on these paths where they would have 

883
00:39:13,590 --> 00:39:17,131
like these little benches,
like blowjobs stations and then go for 

884
00:39:17,131 --> 00:39:19,990
another mile down.
Imagine that place would be expensive as

885
00:39:20,020 --> 00:39:23,030
fuck to keep up.
He had a staff about 100,

886
00:39:23,060 --> 00:39:25,210
200 people there too.
All the time.

887
00:39:25,270 --> 00:39:26,950
I don't know.
One hundred,

888
00:39:26,951 --> 00:39:28,610
200 people.
There's a lot of people.

889
00:39:28,690 --> 00:39:32,980
Imagine you had to pay 100 people and 
it's to run your house.

890
00:39:33,340 --> 00:39:34,860
Yeah,
that's amazing.

891
00:39:34,900 --> 00:39:35,740
That's craziness.

892
00:39:36,590 --> 00:39:39,000
Joan rivers of some shit like that.
I don't know.

893
00:39:39,001 --> 00:39:40,770
Joel Rubin,
you know at the end of the day,

894
00:39:40,771 --> 00:39:45,771
that place to calmly store,
they should just pick those places up 

895
00:39:45,771 --> 00:39:49,670
and put them together so people could 
see that for centuries when the world 

896
00:39:49,670 --> 00:39:53,991
ends.
Is it because that's one of the most 

897
00:39:53,991 --> 00:39:55,230
interesting places in the world.
Flood Disneyland would fucking rides and

898
00:39:55,231 --> 00:39:59,320
Mickey mouse to mention how many Cox 
were really sucked there.

899
00:39:59,660 --> 00:40:02,640
How many dreams were broken there?
How many women left there going,

900
00:40:02,641 --> 00:40:04,350
I'm done.
You know what I'm saying?

901
00:40:04,351 --> 00:40:06,660
Like I just sucked at 11 cops.
I got crabs,

902
00:40:06,661 --> 00:40:08,400
I got chlamydia,
I'm done.

903
00:40:08,401 --> 00:40:13,401
And he didn't put me in the magazine.
I think of what really happened in that 

904
00:40:13,401 --> 00:40:15,420
because that's completely different than
being on the east coast.

905
00:40:15,480 --> 00:40:18,570
That's,
that's a fucking of broken dreams,

906
00:40:18,640 --> 00:40:23,640
you know,
it was the coolest thing was how many 

907
00:40:23,640 --> 00:40:24,920
older playmates were there?
They were the coolest girls in the road.

908
00:40:24,930 --> 00:40:27,440
Like I was sitting in the game room 
smoking weed on the.

909
00:40:27,690 --> 00:40:32,690
I mean,
I don't know if I should say there was a

910
00:40:33,780 --> 00:40:37,690
room that the floor's made out of a,
like a mattress.

911
00:40:37,750 --> 00:40:40,030
So like you walk in and suddenly your 
feet feel weird.

912
00:40:40,031 --> 00:40:41,110
Like what are you wearing?
Shoes.

913
00:40:41,111 --> 00:40:41,640
Yeah,
yeah.

914
00:40:41,790 --> 00:40:43,050
Great Staff.
Right?

915
00:40:43,060 --> 00:40:45,880
I know it's fucking to get staff with 
the carpets just doesn't,

916
00:40:45,881 --> 00:40:48,980
it looks like carpet,
but it's actually a mattress so,

917
00:40:49,030 --> 00:40:54,030
so you just sit down anyways.
But there was like these ladies that 

918
00:40:54,030 --> 00:40:54,030
would come out of nowhere and there were
beautiful,

919
00:40:54,030 --> 00:40:57,280
the most beautiful cougars out,
I would say 45,

920
00:40:57,640 --> 00:40:59,800
48 and they would just come up with 
like,

921
00:40:59,890 --> 00:41:01,030
hey guys,
how's it going?

922
00:41:01,180 --> 00:41:03,400
Mind if I join you and you're just like,
that's the coolest shit.

923
00:41:03,401 --> 00:41:08,401
Hot Chick like that part of their uh,
their occupation to sort of mingle and.

924
00:41:09,161 --> 00:41:14,161
Well it was July fourth.
So I think it was more of just like all 

925
00:41:14,161 --> 00:41:16,340
the family arguing,
bobby

926
00:41:16,350 --> 00:41:17,740
betting,
all those chips were playmates,

927
00:41:17,810 --> 00:41:18,570
bro.
What's.

928
00:41:18,571 --> 00:41:20,380
She really wasn't the.
But I think.

929
00:41:20,381 --> 00:41:20,620
Yeah,
yeah,

930
00:41:20,630 --> 00:41:21,550
yeah,
yeah.

931
00:41:21,600 --> 00:41:23,290
Is she still doing comedy?
No.

932
00:41:23,291 --> 00:41:27,370
Barbi Benton from the center of the 
Brunette when we were kids.

933
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:32,440
How am I thinking of a Barbie with the 
vein of the tech from the comedy store 

934
00:41:32,440 --> 00:41:33,640
that used to do that.
We'd room.

935
00:41:33,641 --> 00:41:38,641
I'm fucking Vermont.
That bobby doesn't have the yellow car.

936
00:41:41,060 --> 00:41:42,940
Is that what the yellow mercy she had 
taken over.

937
00:41:43,320 --> 00:41:47,930
But they put the vein from a bicep right
in her tit instead of a tattoo.

938
00:41:47,931 --> 00:41:50,300
This bitch had a big Ole yogurt vein 
like,

939
00:41:50,950 --> 00:41:52,670
fuck,
getting crunches,

940
00:41:52,940 --> 00:41:55,310
crunches butterflies all after on the 
machine.

941
00:41:55,320 --> 00:41:56,180
Whatever the fuck it is.

942
00:41:58,820 --> 00:42:00,890
I kept on thinking I was going to see 
Felicia Michael's.

943
00:42:00,891 --> 00:42:04,790
It was like a bunch of Felicia.
Felicia go there.

944
00:42:05,060 --> 00:42:06,500
No,
I don't think she goes.

945
00:42:06,580 --> 00:42:08,480
I think she's been there.
The part like for parties,

946
00:42:08,481 --> 00:42:10,100
like all of us.
How's she doing?

947
00:42:10,120 --> 00:42:11,980
She does.
She's doing whatever.

948
00:42:12,740 --> 00:42:15,110
Don't know.
She was a funny check man.

949
00:42:15,140 --> 00:42:15,920
Yeah,
they were all.

950
00:42:15,950 --> 00:42:17,480
Everybody's doing good.
But that place,

951
00:42:18,260 --> 00:42:23,260
that place is very interesting.
Like I went there with a complete 

952
00:42:23,260 --> 00:42:23,690
different,
like I did the comedy for time,

953
00:42:23,700 --> 00:42:28,700
like estate years ago on Fridays and I 
go and hang out and some of it I can't 

954
00:42:28,700 --> 00:42:28,970
lie to you.
It's not my cup of tea,

955
00:42:28,971 --> 00:42:31,490
you know,
it's not going to suck my dick or you're

956
00:42:31,491 --> 00:42:36,491
not,
you're not gonna walk around naked and 

957
00:42:36,491 --> 00:42:36,491
talk to me like that,
you know what I'm saying?

958
00:42:36,491 --> 00:42:39,210
But these,
these savages where you know,

959
00:42:39,310 --> 00:42:41,870
and it was just peep when you're looking
at them and you feel bad,

960
00:42:41,871 --> 00:42:43,680
but they're having a great time and they
have like,

961
00:42:44,180 --> 00:42:48,110
people come up there with the illusion 
that they gotta meet playmates,

962
00:42:48,160 --> 00:42:51,320
right?
Like they had guys on this shit.

963
00:42:51,380 --> 00:42:53,350
Polyester suits,
three piece,

964
00:42:53,920 --> 00:42:55,700
the shoes.
It's really,

965
00:42:55,910 --> 00:42:58,310
it was weird.
But when you look at that place,

966
00:42:58,311 --> 00:42:59,960
you go,
what really went on in that?

967
00:43:00,290 --> 00:43:01,670
Well,
what's interesting to me,

968
00:43:01,720 --> 00:43:03,340
it is a,
if I think about it,

969
00:43:03,460 --> 00:43:08,460
the playboy mansion,
is that it's sort of like the last sort 

970
00:43:08,460 --> 00:43:10,600
of house like that have a however it's 
not going to exist anymore.

971
00:43:10,720 --> 00:43:15,720
I think it's gonna be a museum because 
when I was walking through I felt very 

972
00:43:15,720 --> 00:43:16,030
like I could see this being a chippy 
kinda.

973
00:43:16,120 --> 00:43:16,810
Yeah,
you cannot.

974
00:43:16,960 --> 00:43:20,320
Then that's not disrespectful at all.
I think that no one,

975
00:43:20,410 --> 00:43:23,710
I mean maybe someone could do something 
like that in the future where they could

976
00:43:23,711 --> 00:43:27,250
create like a whole destination,
but that's a destination.

977
00:43:27,251 --> 00:43:29,620
It's not just a house,
it's not just the business.

978
00:43:29,630 --> 00:43:31,000
Like it would be like,
oh,

979
00:43:31,001 --> 00:43:33,580
there's the strikeforce fights this 
weekend at the playboy mansion.

980
00:43:33,581 --> 00:43:35,940
Like they had fights there.
We went to watch fight there.

981
00:43:36,420 --> 00:43:37,870
You know,
they had a,

982
00:43:37,900 --> 00:43:40,450
they had more than one mixed martial 
arts event.

983
00:43:40,500 --> 00:43:45,500
They're having kids though and his sons 
and I think they're going to take over.

984
00:43:46,210 --> 00:43:48,220
I mean,
hey look like young versions of him.

985
00:43:48,221 --> 00:43:50,830
Like I could see them just stepping in 
and being like,

986
00:43:50,890 --> 00:43:54,160
fucking pimps.
Well they haven't makes sense.

987
00:43:54,161 --> 00:43:55,270
He would groom them.
You know,

988
00:43:55,300 --> 00:43:57,370
why wouldn't you want to keep that 
business in the family?

989
00:43:57,371 --> 00:43:58,990
It's a iconic name.
You know?

990
00:43:59,020 --> 00:44:03,040
It's like you can't go wrong with good 
management with a whole playboy thing.

991
00:44:03,160 --> 00:44:05,740
The craziest thing,
just licensing those tattoos.

992
00:44:06,130 --> 00:44:11,130
When I lived in boulder,
there was a girl in boulder who was a 

993
00:44:11,130 --> 00:44:14,101
limo in boulder at all times.
That's at number one on it and it was a 

994
00:44:14,101 --> 00:44:18,991
white stretch limo and a black driver 
and the chick was blonde and her claim 

995
00:44:18,991 --> 00:44:22,300
to fame was that she was doing it real.
She went to the University of Colorado.

996
00:44:22,320 --> 00:44:24,640
He drove every winter fucking limo.
Wow.

997
00:44:24,641 --> 00:44:29,430
A half one limo,
f one limo and in a bunch of coke.

998
00:44:29,440 --> 00:44:32,970
She did not.
That's what I mean.

999
00:44:32,971 --> 00:44:34,290
How many people I know.
I know.

1000
00:44:34,291 --> 00:44:39,291
Like James Caan was associated like I 
watched that movie was on about a month 

1001
00:44:39,291 --> 00:44:39,450
ago.
That stupid movie.

1002
00:44:39,451 --> 00:44:44,451
Twenty one.
What was that movie that the girl got 

1003
00:44:44,451 --> 00:44:46,701
killed?
Eric Roberts played the creepy 

1004
00:44:46,701 --> 00:44:46,701
boyfriend.
Oh No,

1005
00:44:46,701 --> 00:44:46,701
no,
no,

1006
00:44:46,701 --> 00:44:46,701
no.
I'm sorry.

1007
00:44:46,701 --> 00:44:47,970
Let's see.
Come on.

1008
00:44:48,450 --> 00:44:50,100
Come on guys.
What the fuck?

1009
00:44:51,570 --> 00:44:52,590
She was the playmate.

1010
00:44:52,590 --> 00:44:54,140
Nineteen 81.
Sharon.

1011
00:44:54,390 --> 00:44:58,600
I know Eric Roberts.
Killer.

1012
00:44:59,300 --> 00:45:00,930
They did 19 what?
Nineteen.

1013
00:45:00,950 --> 00:45:05,220
Whether she was the playmate ladies.
Jesus Christ.

1014
00:45:05,221 --> 00:45:10,221
Your fucking stupid.
It was a movie with Eric Roberts was 

1015
00:45:10,221 --> 00:45:13,860
creepy as fuck and he plays a boyfriend.
He discovers her in Canada,

1016
00:45:14,250 --> 00:45:18,060
brings it to Marisa.
She's like 15 strange.

1017
00:45:18,061 --> 00:45:20,710
When you see a guy like Eric,
Eric Roberts that you see them,

1018
00:45:20,720 --> 00:45:22,710
he starts out Poba,
Greenwich Village.

1019
00:45:22,711 --> 00:45:26,040
She's in this fucking unbelievable movie
with Mickey Rourke.

1020
00:45:26,041 --> 00:45:31,041
I could just still to this day holds up.
Then one day he's on celebrity rehab in 

1021
00:45:32,720 --> 00:45:37,720
between.
It's like some karate movies and shit 

1022
00:45:37,720 --> 00:45:37,720
and you know,
for whatever reason,

1023
00:45:37,720 --> 00:45:39,870
like he vanishes and then has to come 
back.

1024
00:45:40,170 --> 00:45:41,940
That's his daughter that's blowing up 
right now.

1025
00:45:42,190 --> 00:45:44,610
Who just got his daughter.
That's the chicken is an actress.

1026
00:45:44,700 --> 00:45:49,700
Yeah.
The daughter was the daughter on a star 

1027
00:45:49,700 --> 00:45:49,700
rating right there?
Yeah.

1028
00:45:49,700 --> 00:45:54,030
Wow.
I don't even believe I've seen this 

1029
00:45:54,030 --> 00:45:54,030
movie.

1030
00:45:54,030 --> 00:45:55,980
He was creepy at the end of the fucking 
gets these benches.

1031
00:45:55,981 --> 00:46:00,981
He was making weightlifting equipment,
but you also the real business where he 

1032
00:46:00,981 --> 00:46:04,581
was,
he was making sex equipment and she 

1033
00:46:04,581 --> 00:46:04,581
takes her over there.
He sits it down.

1034
00:46:04,581 --> 00:46:06,080
He fucking ties are you rips her legs 
up.

1035
00:46:06,090 --> 00:46:07,830
I mean he just destroyed it though.
He was.

1036
00:46:08,340 --> 00:46:10,440
He was a creepy mother five,
and he shot himself.

1037
00:46:10,441 --> 00:46:12,000
Fuck them.
You know in the movie?

1038
00:46:12,030 --> 00:46:14,320
Yeah.
He saw two dudes.

1039
00:46:14,360 --> 00:46:19,360
They did two movies that star ready with
this broad and they did a different one 

1040
00:46:19,360 --> 00:46:23,690
with the guy from the general hospital.
Now the older guy that I married on 

1041
00:46:23,690 --> 00:46:28,080
June,
do you remember when they cut his thumb 

1042
00:46:28,080 --> 00:46:28,710
off public?
We're going to take my thumb.

1043
00:46:28,770 --> 00:46:32,270
Chocolate Gum,
my dog.

1044
00:46:32,390 --> 00:46:37,390
But he's shown the monologue.
What he says to Mickey Rourke when he 

1045
00:46:37,390 --> 00:46:37,390
goes,
what happened?

1046
00:46:37,390 --> 00:46:38,530
Here you go.
She left me.

1047
00:46:38,530 --> 00:46:40,140
Go what?
And he goes,

1048
00:46:40,141 --> 00:46:41,490
what's wrong with you?
He goes,

1049
00:46:41,491 --> 00:46:43,190
you don't have to remember.
He just breaks it down and go.

1050
00:46:43,230 --> 00:46:48,230
Sometimes they try to embarrass you and 
you've got a backhand them and you look 

1051
00:46:48,230 --> 00:46:49,140
into the face and tell them,
you don't look at nobody.

1052
00:46:49,350 --> 00:46:54,350
You don't say good night to nobody.
That whole little monologue at that 

1053
00:46:54,350 --> 00:46:55,340
again was excellent.
Excellent.

1054
00:46:55,780 --> 00:46:57,510
He was a really,
really good actor.

1055
00:46:57,720 --> 00:47:02,720
That's why it's weird when you see him 
like one day and that crazy karate 

1056
00:47:02,720 --> 00:47:06,651
movie.
Remember that Shit I just played in 

1057
00:47:06,651 --> 00:47:06,651
karate.
Masters backfires too.

1058
00:47:06,651 --> 00:47:10,530
As satisfying as you ready for this.
I just saw them motherfucking audition 

1059
00:47:10,530 --> 00:47:15,470
about eight weeks ago.
Really understand for what additionally 

1060
00:47:15,470 --> 00:47:16,160
for Costar like me.
All right,

1061
00:47:16,170 --> 00:47:17,880
so that's how.
It doesn't make any sense.

1062
00:47:18,210 --> 00:47:19,230
I just,
I don't understand.

1063
00:47:19,231 --> 00:47:24,231
How does a guy who's that talented and 
he was in that Sylvester stallone movie 

1064
00:47:24,231 --> 00:47:25,220
recently?
Um,

1065
00:47:25,320 --> 00:47:30,320
he was in the first one.
What is the one with Randy coture the 

1066
00:47:30,320 --> 00:47:30,320
expendables?
Yeah.

1067
00:47:30,330 --> 00:47:30,880
Yeah,
yeah.

1068
00:47:30,881 --> 00:47:31,780
He was in.
That wasn't.

1069
00:47:32,370 --> 00:47:34,930
He wasn't.
Yeah,

1070
00:47:34,931 --> 00:47:37,690
I'm pretty sure he was the bad guy.
He was fucking excellent guy.

1071
00:47:37,691 --> 00:47:41,100
Can Act as Asada and insisted on them.
He says,

1072
00:47:41,430 --> 00:47:43,510
I know that when he was,
when they were doing,

1073
00:47:43,840 --> 00:47:48,840
you know who his daughter is,
the chicken blow the little girl in 

1074
00:47:48,840 --> 00:47:48,840
blow.
What's the movie?

1075
00:47:48,840 --> 00:47:52,981
Love with that little girl.
And then she went out to be a Disney 

1076
00:47:52,981 --> 00:47:53,200
star.
She's a Disney store.

1077
00:47:53,230 --> 00:47:55,480
Look at Rob Redman.
She's like some Disney check.

1078
00:47:55,930 --> 00:48:00,820
But supposedly when they shoot at the 
studios they have security that he can't

1079
00:48:00,821 --> 00:48:03,400
come on the set.
And she's Julia Roberts.

1080
00:48:03,401 --> 00:48:08,401
Nice.
So Julia Roberts really like fucking 

1081
00:48:08,401 --> 00:48:08,590
with security on him and stuff because 
she,

1082
00:48:08,930 --> 00:48:11,440
they try to keep her away from him.
I don't know the whole story.

1083
00:48:11,830 --> 00:48:15,970
I'm just telling you what I heard second
hand when she shoots movies or TV shows.

1084
00:48:16,440 --> 00:48:21,440
There's something going on there.
I don't know exactly what the fuck the 

1085
00:48:21,440 --> 00:48:21,440
thing is.
She's really cute kid.

1086
00:48:21,440 --> 00:48:26,160
She was a cute girl and blow that.
He tells you he's going to meet her at 

1087
00:48:26,160 --> 00:48:26,160
the end.
The whole thing.

1088
00:48:26,160 --> 00:48:29,620
Well when he was on celebrity rehab it 
was very strange.

1089
00:48:29,780 --> 00:48:31,540
It just didn't make any sense that he 
was there.

1090
00:48:31,650 --> 00:48:36,650
Like it seemed like he just needed a 
break and didn't really enjoy Robert's 

1091
00:48:36,650 --> 00:48:39,270
Emma Roberts.
I'm Roberts.

1092
00:48:39,340 --> 00:48:40,260
She's real cute.
Right?

1093
00:48:40,940 --> 00:48:45,940
Young girl has got to be safe.
Whenever someone going to rehab for re 

1094
00:48:45,940 --> 00:48:49,110
we'd.
They're really almost need like a 

1095
00:48:49,110 --> 00:48:49,110
behavior or break the need.
Like you know,

1096
00:48:49,110 --> 00:48:52,870
you go into Rehab for life,
you're off the rails for everything.

1097
00:48:52,871 --> 00:48:53,620
And he said,
you know,

1098
00:48:53,680 --> 00:48:56,320
if you really,
if you go into a rehab for weed,

1099
00:48:56,321 --> 00:48:58,760
it's like a.
He just need to go somewhere.

1100
00:48:59,140 --> 00:49:03,010
Do you think there's certain cases that 
you could see going to rehab her way,

1101
00:49:03,011 --> 00:49:04,480
like people like,
you know,

1102
00:49:04,481 --> 00:49:09,481
like went,
Ralphie may used to be at his prime 

1103
00:49:09,481 --> 00:49:09,481
where he'd be like,
seriously smoking,

1104
00:49:09,481 --> 00:49:10,350
like two pounds of weed a day or 
something.

1105
00:49:10,440 --> 00:49:12,400
He's a perfect example,
you know,

1106
00:49:12,401 --> 00:49:14,380
and no disrespect to Ralphie but look at
them.

1107
00:49:14,790 --> 00:49:17,290
Yeah.
And so that's obviously a very impulsive

1108
00:49:17,291 --> 00:49:20,230
person and that's where I think that 
it's probably,

1109
00:49:20,231 --> 00:49:22,660
you're not dealing with just the wheat 
itself,

1110
00:49:22,940 --> 00:49:26,130
dealing with life in general.
Like there's this look,

1111
00:49:26,140 --> 00:49:31,140
we're all impulsive standup comedians 
and some most impulsive people to 

1112
00:49:31,140 --> 00:49:34,330
something about the type of person that 
thinks to say the,

1113
00:49:34,331 --> 00:49:38,680
some of the shit that we say like the 
way your brain works this word.

1114
00:49:39,100 --> 00:49:41,410
It's almost like an instinct for us to 
just be wacky.

1115
00:49:41,670 --> 00:49:42,130
You know,
it's,

1116
00:49:42,140 --> 00:49:42,730
it's,
uh,

1117
00:49:43,090 --> 00:49:48,090
so when you get a guy that like is a 
standup comedian and then you find out 

1118
00:49:48,090 --> 00:49:49,300
he's a gambling addict,
it's never a shock.

1119
00:49:49,780 --> 00:49:51,250
It's never a shock when they're,
you know,

1120
00:49:51,260 --> 00:49:52,690
you find out they're blowing all their 
money,

1121
00:49:52,691 --> 00:49:57,691
betting on sports,
like it's normal Mcdonald's or blow all 

1122
00:49:57,691 --> 00:49:58,840
their money on for years.

1123
00:49:59,500 --> 00:50:04,500
But for me,
how about I locked myself in my house 

1124
00:50:04,500 --> 00:50:04,570
and I played quake for 12 hours a day.
I'm a fucking idiot,

1125
00:50:04,571 --> 00:50:05,770
you know,
it's the same thing.

1126
00:50:05,771 --> 00:50:10,771
It's like we get impulsive,
we have this like almost uncontrollable 

1127
00:50:10,771 --> 00:50:11,500
desire.
I wouldn't be sitting around.

1128
00:50:11,501 --> 00:50:16,501
I was like,
I would be sitting around doing 

1129
00:50:16,501 --> 00:50:16,501
something else and all I could think of 
was getting back to my computer.

1130
00:50:16,501 --> 00:50:21,000
I'm like,
I just want to get online and play some 

1131
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:22,921
quake and everything will be okay.
Loaded myself up with caffeine and why?

1132
00:50:22,991 --> 00:50:25,330
Because it's crazy.
It's part of being a comedian,

1133
00:50:25,870 --> 00:50:26,410
you know?
So I,

1134
00:50:26,420 --> 00:50:31,420
I,
I kind of understand comedians being 

1135
00:50:31,420 --> 00:50:32,660
caught up in almost any like,
nutty impulse like that,

1136
00:50:33,800 --> 00:50:38,800
but you know,
marijuana really going to go to rehab 

1137
00:50:38,800 --> 00:50:38,800
for that.
You're going to rehab for lifestyle.

1138
00:50:38,800 --> 00:50:42,940
That's what you do in life itself is 
just too slippery right now and need a 

1139
00:50:42,940 --> 00:50:42,940
break,
which is understandable.

1140
00:50:43,640 --> 00:50:45,830
You know,
I need to go to Rehab for Jack Daniels.

1141
00:50:45,831 --> 00:50:48,210
I think she really.
How often you've been drinking?

1142
00:50:48,220 --> 00:50:48,610
No,
I mean,

1143
00:50:48,660 --> 00:50:51,710
I mean not for drinking in general,
but like I,

1144
00:50:51,930 --> 00:50:55,070
I try not to drink Jack Daniels now and 
it's like I miss it so much.

1145
00:50:55,071 --> 00:51:00,071
It's so hard not to do.
I've never drink Jack Daniels my whole 

1146
00:51:00,071 --> 00:51:00,071
entire life except for like the last,
what?

1147
00:51:00,410 --> 00:51:05,410
Seven months.
Coincidentally the last year of your 

1148
00:51:05,410 --> 00:51:05,410
life,
you've been balling out of control.

1149
00:51:05,410 --> 00:51:07,240
You're going out layers,
scared style son.

1150
00:51:08,210 --> 00:51:10,010
You'll listen to this sweet home,
Alabama.

1151
00:51:10,011 --> 00:51:13,490
You of drives off the cliff.
And what's the number?

1152
00:51:13,491 --> 00:51:17,390
Seven meaning the Jack Daniels?
The lucky seven or some shit like that.

1153
00:51:17,450 --> 00:51:20,140
It says this is like old number seven.
I don't know.

1154
00:51:20,150 --> 00:51:23,090
It's probably like their seventh version
of it that they made.

1155
00:51:23,510 --> 00:51:25,010
If I had to guess,
let's find out.

1156
00:51:25,250 --> 00:51:30,250
Jack Daniels,
old number seven ingredients gamble for 

1157
00:51:30,250 --> 00:51:30,290
about four months.

1158
00:51:30,410 --> 00:51:33,260
I knew it wasn't me.
Yeah,

1159
00:51:33,261 --> 00:51:34,250
I,
I can't.

1160
00:51:34,310 --> 00:51:36,500
I can't glorify months.
And I was like,

1161
00:51:36,530 --> 00:51:39,470
fuck you.
I don't trust myself.

1162
00:51:39,530 --> 00:51:43,610
I'm going to give my money to some 
fucking Dinah Thursday at 5:00,

1163
00:51:44,330 --> 00:51:49,330
over five fucking dudes shooting a hoop.
That is not happening the rest of my 

1164
00:51:49,330 --> 00:51:52,900
fucking life or baseball or basketball 
or anything that was.

1165
00:51:52,970 --> 00:51:55,970
I love going like Santa Anita Park and 
Pasadena.

1166
00:51:56,390 --> 00:51:58,700
I take $40 with me.
I go and get a hotdog.

1167
00:51:59,050 --> 00:52:01,670
I got a powdered beer once.
The $40 is good.

1168
00:52:01,680 --> 00:52:05,500
I get in my fucking car and I go home.
You just say a powdered powdered beer.

1169
00:52:05,740 --> 00:52:06,790
Really?
So I.

1170
00:52:06,790 --> 00:52:08,830
They think they saw you fucking draft 
beer.

1171
00:52:10,440 --> 00:52:12,290
That's why I got a fucking headache for 
three days.

1172
00:52:12,720 --> 00:52:14,820
He was a football game where you have 
see a vet,

1173
00:52:14,830 --> 00:52:17,000
you drink three beers,
went to the fucking headache.

1174
00:52:17,001 --> 00:52:18,220
You get the next day.
Yeah.

1175
00:52:18,300 --> 00:52:20,010
You know it's pounded fucking bit.

1176
00:52:20,360 --> 00:52:21,500
Yeah.
That was real.

1177
00:52:21,501 --> 00:52:23,240
How cool would that be?
Having powder beards.

1178
00:52:23,270 --> 00:52:26,290
Powdered bit.
I'm telling you,

1179
00:52:28,340 --> 00:52:30,410
this is a weird thing.
This Jack Daniels thing,

1180
00:52:30,411 --> 00:52:33,830
because apparently the old number seven 
is the original recipe.

1181
00:52:35,180 --> 00:52:38,060
I don't get it.
Why would they call number seven?

1182
00:52:38,061 --> 00:52:40,250
It says old number seven.
Known ingredients.

1183
00:52:40,310 --> 00:52:43,970
Also known as black label.
This is the original Jack Daniels.

1184
00:52:45,050 --> 00:52:50,050
Oh,
you know what it is because there's a 

1185
00:52:50,050 --> 00:52:50,050
bunch of different jacks.
One,

1186
00:52:50,050 --> 00:52:50,050
two,
three,

1187
00:52:50,050 --> 00:52:50,050
four,
five,

1188
00:52:50,050 --> 00:52:51,200
six,
six different tracks.

1189
00:52:51,440 --> 00:52:55,880
There's silver select green label,
Tennessee honey,

1190
00:52:56,180 --> 00:52:59,090
single barrel gentleman,
Jack.

1191
00:52:59,110 --> 00:53:00,670
I like that.
And old number seven.

1192
00:53:01,190 --> 00:53:02,900
Six.
Chuck Liddell's.

1193
00:53:03,260 --> 00:53:05,260
Everybody.
That's the right one.

1194
00:53:05,290 --> 00:53:08,870
Weekly that I don't fuck with none of 
those cock suckers.

1195
00:53:08,880 --> 00:53:10,660
They'll fuck you up.
And you believed that Bro.

1196
00:53:10,670 --> 00:53:13,550
I really have not drank.
Jack Daniels was New Year's Eve.

1197
00:53:13,551 --> 00:53:14,570
Nineteen 80.
Well,

1198
00:53:14,571 --> 00:53:16,000
it got a big bottle in the other room.
Boy,

1199
00:53:16,230 --> 00:53:17,450
I had some of it.

1200
00:53:17,450 --> 00:53:18,040
Um,
uh,

1201
00:53:18,180 --> 00:53:20,160
this weekend.
Friday night.

1202
00:53:20,220 --> 00:53:21,230
Delicious.
Yeah,

1203
00:53:21,240 --> 00:53:22,850
I joined.
It was in a can of coke.

1204
00:53:22,880 --> 00:53:25,280
You're fucking taking me for a rough 
tell you Joey Diaz.

1205
00:53:25,290 --> 00:53:30,290
I do some of our best comedy sets when I
have a little Jack Daniels and my 

1206
00:53:30,290 --> 00:53:30,290
sister.
I'm not bullshitting.

1207
00:53:30,290 --> 00:53:31,630
Even smell like Vegas.
Fucking smell it though.

1208
00:53:31,800 --> 00:53:33,530
Vegas.
Friday night I had like three,

1209
00:53:33,620 --> 00:53:36,360
three shots before I went on stage.
He brought the bottle back there.

1210
00:53:36,361 --> 00:53:38,710
I see that there was lightened.
You motherfuckers drinking.

1211
00:53:38,810 --> 00:53:40,890
Those are diet cokes.
Listen,

1212
00:53:41,130 --> 00:53:44,670
I could smell them in the year.
That crowd though was so fun.

1213
00:53:44,940 --> 00:53:49,940
It was fun.
It was so much good stuff in the air at 

1214
00:53:49,940 --> 00:53:49,940
that,
at that show.

1215
00:53:49,940 --> 00:53:50,820
That was such a positive show,
man.

1216
00:53:50,850 --> 00:53:52,650
I was a great show and the people that 
came,

1217
00:53:52,651 --> 00:53:55,020
I listened,
man that you have the expo.

1218
00:53:55,021 --> 00:53:58,140
If I wouldn't have fucked up my ankle,
I would have gone and walked around.

1219
00:53:58,280 --> 00:53:59,640
You were limping a little bit.
Yeah.

1220
00:53:59,641 --> 00:54:00,660
I'm good now.
The next.

1221
00:54:00,680 --> 00:54:05,680
That was good.
Something that morning I twisted 

1222
00:54:05,680 --> 00:54:05,680
something with these fucking adidas 
tops.

1223
00:54:05,680 --> 00:54:07,770
No more than fucking hurt,
but the next day I was fine,

1224
00:54:08,330 --> 00:54:10,140
but I would have gone.
What a great little thing.

1225
00:54:10,660 --> 00:54:13,110
It's a great little show.
You get to meet.

1226
00:54:13,111 --> 00:54:15,540
You can roll with people.
You pay $10,000.

1227
00:54:15,541 --> 00:54:18,240
You could roll with fucking Frank Mir.
They have seminars.

1228
00:54:18,241 --> 00:54:21,330
They had all said the same time we're 
teaching things.

1229
00:54:21,331 --> 00:54:22,050
Yeah,
I've.

1230
00:54:22,230 --> 00:54:26,380
I think it's beautiful.
When did you,

1231
00:54:26,940 --> 00:54:31,940
when you were a kid,
you didn't get to play football against 

1232
00:54:31,940 --> 00:54:31,940
everybody.
Yeah,

1233
00:54:31,940 --> 00:54:31,940
and you never got to talk to you,
you know,

1234
00:54:32,070 --> 00:54:36,260
q and a's with Ronda Rousey Twain's.
It's a great fun.

1235
00:54:36,480 --> 00:54:41,480
You after your q and a,
did you hang and talk to the people you 

1236
00:54:41,480 --> 00:54:41,480
went to eat as much as I could.
They had a,

1237
00:54:41,480 --> 00:54:45,650
I was doing this thing for the 20 year 
reunion of a or the 20 year anniversary 

1238
00:54:45,650 --> 00:54:45,650
of the UFC.

1239
00:54:45,650 --> 00:54:48,500
There's a documentary they're doing.
So they had rushed me up to this,

1240
00:54:48,501 --> 00:54:53,501
a studio that they had set up where they
interviewed me for like an hour before 

1241
00:54:53,501 --> 00:54:55,180
the weigh ins.
Then we had to rush back to uh,

1242
00:54:55,270 --> 00:54:58,010
because I had an mc the way ends and 
they did the lands.

1243
00:54:58,220 --> 00:55:01,500
The fucking wins were in the arena.
It was insane.

1244
00:55:01,800 --> 00:55:06,800
The winds were in the Mandalay bay 
convention center and it was fucking Gi 

1245
00:55:07,620 --> 00:55:08,940
Gan tick.
It was,

1246
00:55:08,941 --> 00:55:10,020
uh,
the event center,

1247
00:55:10,050 --> 00:55:12,180
Mandalay Bay events center where they 
usually do the USA.

1248
00:55:12,181 --> 00:55:16,590
So the way ins where I know it was like 
10,000

1249
00:55:16,591 --> 00:55:20,250
people at the weigh ins and when 
Anderson Silva and Weidman gone onstage,

1250
00:55:20,550 --> 00:55:25,550
they went not like you could feel this 
crazy electricity in the air,

1251
00:55:26,070 --> 00:55:31,070
you know.
And there was all these Brazilians that 

1252
00:55:31,070 --> 00:55:33,711
were bullying when Wyman came out.
And all these people were cheering for 

1253
00:55:33,711 --> 00:55:33,810
Anderson and you hear all these 
accolades,

1254
00:55:33,811 --> 00:55:38,811
you know,
you hear everybody call him the 

1255
00:55:38,811 --> 00:55:40,490
including me,
especially me calling him the greatest 

1256
00:55:40,490 --> 00:55:40,490
fighter in the history of the sport.

1257
00:55:40,490 --> 00:55:42,570
And how long was that kits for it.
And like couple of minutes,

1258
00:55:42,571 --> 00:55:43,940
second or two,
you know,

1259
00:55:43,960 --> 00:55:46,690
just anderson like walked up to him and 
uh,

1260
00:55:46,740 --> 00:55:51,740
Weidman walked up closer to Anderson and
Anderson walked closer to him and then 

1261
00:55:52,231 --> 00:55:54,270
they were face to face and neither one 
of them budge.

1262
00:55:54,420 --> 00:55:57,570
So they just touched faces.
And then Weidman,

1263
00:55:57,870 --> 00:55:59,280
as they backed away,
Wyman goes,

1264
00:55:59,310 --> 00:56:00,330
I'm not scared of you,
man.

1265
00:56:00,600 --> 00:56:02,250
I'm not scared of you.
And they understand.

1266
00:56:02,251 --> 00:56:05,490
Goes tomorrow night,
see you tomorrow night.

1267
00:56:05,850 --> 00:56:07,020
He goes,
I'm not scared of you.

1268
00:56:07,920 --> 00:56:10,410
He wasn't scared of a man.
He really wasn't.

1269
00:56:10,500 --> 00:56:13,080
And that was the difference on Saturday 
night.

1270
00:56:13,110 --> 00:56:16,200
He really wasn't scared of him.
He knocked him the fuck out.

1271
00:56:16,201 --> 00:56:21,201
It's crazy.
It was crazy to watch like Anderson 

1272
00:56:21,201 --> 00:56:23,481
fucked around like he normally does and 
like he eat more so than he normally 

1273
00:56:23,481 --> 00:56:24,400
does.
He humiliates guys with that.

1274
00:56:24,400 --> 00:56:26,140
It's a,
it's a real tactic,

1275
00:56:26,410 --> 00:56:31,390
but you got to absolutely know what your
opponent can and can't do.

1276
00:56:31,600 --> 00:56:36,600
I mean maybe he could've gotten away 
with that with like a lesser guy or a 

1277
00:56:36,600 --> 00:56:39,751
guy who's like easily be fuddled,
but one of the things they didn't 

1278
00:56:39,751 --> 00:56:41,050
Weidman's campus,
they had people imitate that.

1279
00:56:41,230 --> 00:56:46,230
They had people like taunt him.
They had people spar with him and like 

1280
00:56:46,230 --> 00:56:50,490
pretend they were falling down and 
dropping their hands and poking their 

1281
00:56:50,490 --> 00:56:54,091
face out and juking them and poc shot 
and them and shit and doing all this 

1282
00:56:54,091 --> 00:56:54,900
stuff that Anderson always does because 
he gets you in,

1283
00:56:54,970 --> 00:56:57,580
in a,
like a defensive shell.

1284
00:56:57,760 --> 00:57:01,720
He gets you frozen up because he moves 
really fast and one of his tactics,

1285
00:57:01,721 --> 00:57:06,721
his,
he will talk you a little bit and then 

1286
00:57:06,721 --> 00:57:06,721
blast on you.
He'll blast on you can,

1287
00:57:06,721 --> 00:57:08,860
he can,
he could cover distance like deceptively

1288
00:57:08,861 --> 00:57:09,370
fast.

1289
00:57:09,670 --> 00:57:14,670
So he's really good at closing the 
distance and crack and dudes and 

1290
00:57:14,670 --> 00:57:18,481
sometimes he can knock them out and 
sometimes like the Vito Belfort shot or 

1291
00:57:18,481 --> 00:57:20,050
sometimes he just lights you up like the
first.

1292
00:57:20,051 --> 00:57:22,170
A few exchanges with Chris liebing,
you know,

1293
00:57:22,220 --> 00:57:23,530
just lit him up,
lift him up,

1294
00:57:23,560 --> 00:57:25,950
lift him up again before you eventually 
stopped him.

1295
00:57:25,990 --> 00:57:29,020
I mean ashland is a fucking tremendous 
talent,

1296
00:57:29,290 --> 00:57:33,850
but that dropping of the hands,
you'll leave yourself so vulnerable that

1297
00:57:33,851 --> 00:57:37,030
even a tremendous talent like him can 
get knocked the fuck out,

1298
00:57:37,360 --> 00:57:40,480
and that's one of the big lessons of 
Saturday night.

1299
00:57:40,870 --> 00:57:44,020
The big lesson is everybody's 
vulnerable.

1300
00:57:44,080 --> 00:57:48,940
Even the best guys are human beings and 
a human being as vulnerable.

1301
00:57:49,210 --> 00:57:53,140
The whole ideas and not get hit and it 
doesn't matter who the human being is.

1302
00:57:53,260 --> 00:57:58,260
If their skill levels really high,
it doesn't prevent them from being 

1303
00:57:58,260 --> 00:57:59,020
damaged by a solid punch.

1304
00:57:59,350 --> 00:58:01,480
Everybody gets fucked up by a solid 
shot.

1305
00:58:01,900 --> 00:58:04,000
Everybody who gets kicked in the head 
goes to sleep.

1306
00:58:04,150 --> 00:58:05,290
You get,
we'll kicked in the head.

1307
00:58:05,291 --> 00:58:07,510
You go night night.
It happens to everybody.

1308
00:58:07,511 --> 00:58:10,720
It happens to the best people in the 
world and that was like a big lesson.

1309
00:58:10,780 --> 00:58:15,780
Saturday night,
the auditory beer really just shut the 

1310
00:58:15,780 --> 00:58:15,780
fuck up.
Didn't.

1311
00:58:15,780 --> 00:58:17,120
It was weird because the room I was in 
stopped.

1312
00:58:17,540 --> 00:58:18,840
It was weird.
Stopped.

1313
00:58:19,420 --> 00:58:22,700
Yeah.
I just stopped and it was a,

1314
00:58:22,710 --> 00:58:24,930
you know what,
it's good for everybody now.

1315
00:58:24,931 --> 00:58:29,931
Now they start from scratch again.
This is going to be interesting whether 

1316
00:58:29,931 --> 00:58:30,750
they're trying to set up the rematch.
Um,

1317
00:58:30,880 --> 00:58:34,810
for the,
the word is online for um,

1318
00:58:35,610 --> 00:58:37,650
the new year's show which is December 
28th,

1319
00:58:37,810 --> 00:58:42,520
which would be guess Matt Desk Job 
Ideas.

1320
00:58:42,790 --> 00:58:46,360
Do you know what kind of hype and I 
guarantee you in a rematch.

1321
00:58:46,600 --> 00:58:51,600
Anderson Silva is gonna dot his i's and 
cross his teeth first knockout though 

1322
00:58:51,760 --> 00:58:53,830
he's never been knocked out his entire 
career.

1323
00:58:53,860 --> 00:58:58,860
People usually get that after time they 
become,

1324
00:58:59,040 --> 00:59:00,910
they become vulnerable and they become 
human beings.

1325
00:59:01,060 --> 00:59:06,060
And not only that,
the reality is if you get knocked out 

1326
00:59:06,060 --> 00:59:09,271
it's easier to get knocked out again.
And who knows what's happened in 

1327
00:59:09,271 --> 00:59:09,430
training.
I mean,

1328
00:59:09,431 --> 00:59:14,431
who knows,
he's sparring with like really high 

1329
00:59:14,431 --> 00:59:14,440
level guys and training on a regular 
basis.

1330
00:59:14,770 --> 00:59:15,900
You know,
he's probably with,

1331
00:59:16,690 --> 00:59:18,810
with Machida,
with Fazio,

1332
00:59:18,840 --> 00:59:23,000
like there's a lot of those black house 
guys that are fucking bad ass beasts,

1333
00:59:23,350 --> 00:59:28,350
you know,
like who knows who's tagging him in the 

1334
00:59:28,350 --> 00:59:28,350
gym,
especially when you're doing long,

1335
00:59:28,350 --> 00:59:32,141
hard rounds.
So everyone turns 38 at one point in 

1336
00:59:32,141 --> 00:59:35,450
their life and Anderson Silva's 38.
So you have to think about that as well,

1337
00:59:35,480 --> 00:59:37,760
but you don't want.
When I was growing up it was 35,

1338
00:59:38,530 --> 00:59:40,790
35,
but we both discussed this.

1339
00:59:40,791 --> 00:59:43,460
Look at our board is 42.
How about.

1340
00:59:43,460 --> 00:59:44,870
Yeah,
how about Bernard?

1341
00:59:44,871 --> 00:59:49,360
Hopkins is 43.
That's what I was talking about I think.

1342
00:59:49,820 --> 00:59:51,590
And this one's got three.
Three more.

1343
00:59:51,620 --> 00:59:52,250
Good,
good.

1344
00:59:52,280 --> 00:59:53,360
Good.
Battles left.

1345
00:59:53,520 --> 00:59:55,520
Oh,
you know what?

1346
00:59:55,521 --> 00:59:58,340
They are even more if he fight smart.
Let me tell you something,

1347
00:59:58,341 --> 01:00:00,020
man,
before he got knocked out,

1348
01:00:00,200 --> 01:00:04,220
he was looking lightning fast.
He was slamming leg kicks in.

1349
01:00:04,221 --> 01:00:06,770
He avoided being submitted.
He got back up to his feet.

1350
01:00:06,980 --> 01:00:08,960
He got out of a heel hook and got back 
up to his feet.

1351
01:00:08,961 --> 01:00:13,961
It's not like Anderson looked bad,
but what he did was he does what he 

1352
01:00:13,961 --> 01:00:13,961
does,
that,

1353
01:00:13,961 --> 01:00:14,810
that taunting thing.
I mean,

1354
01:00:14,811 --> 01:00:16,460
when he knocks the guy out because of 
it,

1355
01:00:16,461 --> 01:00:19,460
it's awesome and it looks great,
but when you get knocked out,

1356
01:00:19,490 --> 01:00:21,260
man,
it's like that commercial,

1357
01:00:21,290 --> 01:00:26,290
you know,
that nos commercial of the guy who does 

1358
01:00:26,290 --> 01:00:28,841
these flippy kicks and the other guy 
just blasted him on a change is called 

1359
01:00:28,841 --> 01:00:30,950
them and boom,
that's um,

1360
01:00:31,070 --> 01:00:36,070
there's,
there's a reason why that's in a 

1361
01:00:36,070 --> 01:00:36,070
commercial.

1362
01:00:36,070 --> 01:00:37,790
That whole scene plays out in the 
commercial as sweet justice,

1363
01:00:38,140 --> 01:00:43,140
like justice to the guy who taunts.
And that's why the whole crowd was 

1364
01:00:43,140 --> 01:00:44,660
booing Anderson.
They were booing.

1365
01:00:44,661 --> 01:00:47,150
Anderson with Anderson got knocked out.
I mean,

1366
01:00:47,610 --> 01:00:49,010
that's,
that's weird.

1367
01:00:49,200 --> 01:00:54,200
It's,
but it's a natural reaction that they 

1368
01:00:54,200 --> 01:00:54,200
had no one told them that they had to 
bu.

1369
01:00:54,200 --> 01:00:59,140
But there was a lot of people booing.
There was a tremendous amount of people 

1370
01:00:59,140 --> 01:01:01,190
booing the best fighter in history 
because he got caught.

1371
01:01:01,400 --> 01:01:03,950
And I think that is fascinating.
They,

1372
01:01:03,960 --> 01:01:04,940
like,
they felt,

1373
01:01:04,941 --> 01:01:09,941
he let them down because he got knocked 
out doing something stupid and they're 

1374
01:01:09,941 --> 01:01:10,610
like,
yeah,

1375
01:01:10,611 --> 01:01:14,090
what did you do man booboo?
Meanwhile,

1376
01:01:14,091 --> 01:01:15,110
what happened to him?
Man,

1377
01:01:15,111 --> 01:01:17,100
I just lost the title.
I mean,

1378
01:01:17,101 --> 01:01:22,101
he made an ass load of money,
but he just lost the title in 

1379
01:01:22,101 --> 01:01:25,870
devastating fashion and people have no 
empathy like big people.

1380
01:01:29,270 --> 01:01:34,270
Don't give a fuck.
People don't get the cold realities of 

1381
01:01:34,270 --> 01:01:34,270
life.
Yeah.

1382
01:01:34,270 --> 01:01:35,120
That's whole mother fucking realities of
life.

1383
01:01:35,180 --> 01:01:38,210
God wants the envelope sales and the 
glamours gun.

1384
01:01:38,640 --> 01:01:40,040
The part.
Have you seen that?

1385
01:01:40,050 --> 01:01:41,510
Unfortunately though.
That sucks,

1386
01:01:41,511 --> 01:01:42,290
man.
That sucks.

1387
01:01:42,720 --> 01:01:45,020
But that's a man.
I saw it with my mother.

1388
01:01:45,021 --> 01:01:47,180
I start with a thousand.
So you would never do that?

1389
01:01:47,270 --> 01:01:48,070
No.
Why would,

1390
01:01:48,071 --> 01:01:53,071
I mean you,
if you were there in the audience and 

1391
01:01:53,071 --> 01:01:53,870
you saw it go down,
you imagine home heartbroken.

1392
01:01:54,220 --> 01:01:55,090
I wouldn't have.
Boom.

1393
01:01:55,100 --> 01:01:56,630
He's still the fuck I know what 
happened.

1394
01:01:56,980 --> 01:01:57,590
I,
yeah,

1395
01:01:57,591 --> 01:01:59,080
as a fan,
I'm fucked.

1396
01:01:59,090 --> 01:02:00,710
You know what the fuck told you to fuck 
around?

1397
01:02:01,480 --> 01:02:02,330
You know,
I'm the same.

1398
01:02:02,331 --> 01:02:04,030
I don't even like fucking around when 
I'm walking around.

1399
01:02:04,220 --> 01:02:05,840
Brian,
I don't even like fucking around.

1400
01:02:05,960 --> 01:02:08,480
When you're walking around pay fucking 
attention.

1401
01:02:08,481 --> 01:02:10,380
You go to an airport and you put your 
shit on line,

1402
01:02:10,410 --> 01:02:12,060
the people in front of you and you're 
like,

1403
01:02:12,510 --> 01:02:13,310
fucking attention.

1404
01:02:13,370 --> 01:02:14,870
Yes.
Shit.

1405
01:02:14,900 --> 01:02:18,230
But if you fucking do it and you pull it
off,

1406
01:02:18,231 --> 01:02:21,720
it's spectacular.
When forrest griffin,

1407
01:02:21,830 --> 01:02:25,050
when he fought fucking Damien Maia,
if you live by the sword,

1408
01:02:25,051 --> 01:02:27,470
you die by the fucking short.
That's why it's called Karma.

1409
01:02:27,900 --> 01:02:32,900
The fight before that I.
that's the first time I watched the 

1410
01:02:32,900 --> 01:02:32,900
fight.
I didn't want to end.

1411
01:02:32,900 --> 01:02:37,000
Even if even if fucking frankie would 
have knocked raphael out Olivera,

1412
01:02:37,240 --> 01:02:38,190
I would have said,
listen,

1413
01:02:38,460 --> 01:02:40,500
let them go again.
Let them go six or seven rounds.

1414
01:02:40,710 --> 01:02:43,530
That was a great fight.
The fight before that was a great,

1415
01:02:43,740 --> 01:02:45,180
great fight.
It was a great night.

1416
01:02:45,910 --> 01:02:50,910
It was a,
it was one of the most exciting nights 

1417
01:02:50,910 --> 01:02:55,101
of fights ever.
Every Jujitsu guy is lightened the 

1418
01:02:55,101 --> 01:02:55,101
fucking candles.
Roger Gracie right now.

1419
01:02:55,101 --> 01:02:56,260
I don't know what happened.
Oh,

1420
01:02:56,590 --> 01:02:59,380
expect that couldn't for whatever 
reason.

1421
01:02:59,430 --> 01:03:03,500
Getting the uh,
his MMA game is nothing like his Jujitsu

1422
01:03:03,530 --> 01:03:04,840
game is off the chain.

1423
01:03:05,430 --> 01:03:08,250
He just go back to fighting in Jujitsu 
tournament span.

1424
01:03:08,251 --> 01:03:11,070
It's like,
it's a great fucking fights.

1425
01:03:11,430 --> 01:03:13,590
How about Cub Swanson?
Oh my God.

1426
01:03:13,620 --> 01:03:15,120
Damn.
Oh my God.

1427
01:03:15,121 --> 01:03:17,570
That was insane.
That was the best that kids ever looked.

1428
01:03:17,600 --> 01:03:19,380
What was curious?
He was insane.

1429
01:03:19,390 --> 01:03:20,950
He tried to cartwheel care.
No,

1430
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:26,000
he did it.
He went to do an upper cut and he went 

1431
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:26,180
from where he faked and he came up with 
an applicant.

1432
01:03:26,210 --> 01:03:28,050
He did something very beautiful.
Yeah,

1433
01:03:28,051 --> 01:03:32,020
he was doing a lot of beautiful shit.
He's really crafty,

1434
01:03:32,021 --> 01:03:34,850
like he's very,
very creative and unpredictable and he's

1435
01:03:35,280 --> 01:03:38,070
like fake slow and kicks high.
He does a lot of weird shit.

1436
01:03:38,071 --> 01:03:39,530
You don't 65 brother?
No,

1437
01:03:39,540 --> 01:03:41,220
he's 45.
He's 1:45.

1438
01:03:41,250 --> 01:03:43,210
Yeah.
That adds a complete different.

1439
01:03:43,290 --> 01:03:45,680
Let's just,
let's just put him up against the doodle

1440
01:03:45,681 --> 01:03:48,170
wanting to fight Benson Henderson in 
Minneapolis.

1441
01:03:49,290 --> 01:03:51,930
Let's do it.
That's a hell of a fight,

1442
01:03:51,931 --> 01:03:52,110
right?

1443
01:03:52,110 --> 01:03:53,790
Would it be a great.
That's a fight right there.

1444
01:03:53,810 --> 01:03:58,810
Well,
I would like to see a rematch with him 

1445
01:03:58,810 --> 01:03:58,810
and Aldo because,
you know,

1446
01:03:58,810 --> 01:03:58,980
he fought Aldo and got caught with a 
flying knee,

1447
01:03:59,110 --> 01:04:01,190
uh,
like a double knee may,

1448
01:04:01,200 --> 01:04:03,810
maybe like 10 seconds into the fight was
very quick.

1449
01:04:04,080 --> 01:04:09,080
All the although jumped up and nailed 
him on the forehead with a flying 

1450
01:04:09,080 --> 01:04:09,480
economy open and it was nasty,
mean,

1451
01:04:09,481 --> 01:04:14,481
you know,
he didn't get a chance to get into the 

1452
01:04:14,481 --> 01:04:14,481
fight.
He just got caught and I think that he's

1453
01:04:14,481 --> 01:04:15,750
a way better fighter now than he was 
then.

1454
01:04:15,751 --> 01:04:19,050
I think it'll be really interesting 
after watching him fight seaver like,

1455
01:04:19,051 --> 01:04:20,730
God damn man,
he didn't see her up.

1456
01:04:20,960 --> 01:04:23,670
He lifts.
Those combinations are insane because he

1457
01:04:23,671 --> 01:04:28,671
was so accurate.
Like the last combination that he 

1458
01:04:28,671 --> 01:04:31,911
knocked him out with,
he hit him with like three or four 

1459
01:04:31,911 --> 01:04:31,911
ridiculously accurate shots.

1460
01:04:31,911 --> 01:04:36,230
While you know it's a lot of chaos going
on and scrambling and scrambling after 

1461
01:04:36,230 --> 01:04:38,310
him and he's catching them on the jaw.
That was a great fight.

1462
01:04:38,580 --> 01:04:39,780
It was a lot of great fights,
man.

1463
01:04:40,150 --> 01:04:43,350
A lot of great fights.
See people didn't give tim credit.

1464
01:04:43,410 --> 01:04:46,980
Kennedy enough credit for that fight.
Not even had his back.

1465
01:04:47,070 --> 01:04:50,670
He took him down and had his back and 
was slamming him in the face.

1466
01:04:50,730 --> 01:04:52,320
I was like,
what the fuck is going on?

1467
01:04:52,440 --> 01:04:53,790
It's getting punched.
That's what's going on,

1468
01:04:53,791 --> 01:04:55,410
man.
Jujitsu is one thing,

1469
01:04:55,411 --> 01:05:00,411
but Jujitsu with punches to the face by 
a guy who's a black belt in Jujitsu 

1470
01:05:00,411 --> 01:05:01,710
changes the whole game,
like you might not be.

1471
01:05:01,740 --> 01:05:06,740
He might be better than Tim Kennedy at 
straight Jujitsu if they had a regular 

1472
01:05:06,740 --> 01:05:10,980
Jujitsu match,
but Kennedy's got a good enough to just 

1473
01:05:10,980 --> 01:05:12,090
say that he could hang,
he can defend himself,

1474
01:05:12,091 --> 01:05:17,091
like he's not scared to grapple with 
really high level guys any strong as 

1475
01:05:17,091 --> 01:05:18,580
shit,
but Kennedy is also a boxer.

1476
01:05:18,610 --> 01:05:21,190
He can hit hard and when he gets it to 
the ground,

1477
01:05:21,191 --> 01:05:24,270
he's got real mixed martial arts skills 
and it gets to the ground health thump.

1478
01:05:24,271 --> 01:05:29,271
You with punches and so the guy like 
Andre is not really quite a complete mma

1479
01:05:29,651 --> 01:05:32,140
fighter yet.
He's just as brilliant Jujitsu guy who's

1480
01:05:32,170 --> 01:05:35,470
entering into mma and there's guys like 
Kennedy out there.

1481
01:05:35,471 --> 01:05:35,880
They'll,
they'll,

1482
01:05:35,930 --> 01:05:40,930
as long as they're hitting you in the 
face like you're not going to submit 

1483
01:05:40,930 --> 01:05:43,171
them.
It's just a completely different 

1484
01:05:43,171 --> 01:05:43,171
ballgame.
You're all dizzy and shit.

1485
01:05:43,171 --> 01:05:44,380
Your face is puffy and you can't see it.
You're right.

1486
01:05:44,381 --> 01:05:47,260
I mean,
that's the reality of getting punched in

1487
01:05:47,261 --> 01:05:48,400
the face.
It's,

1488
01:05:48,850 --> 01:05:53,850
I don't like seeing it when guys like 
really good at Jujitsu and I see them 

1489
01:05:53,850 --> 01:05:53,850
come to mma and they're getting fucked 
up.

1490
01:05:54,050 --> 01:05:59,050
It just,
it kind of bothers me because I feel 

1491
01:05:59,050 --> 01:05:59,050
like,
you know,

1492
01:05:59,050 --> 01:05:59,050
they're not ready yet.

1493
01:05:59,050 --> 01:06:03,840
You should have,
if you're going to really enter into 

1494
01:06:03,840 --> 01:06:04,120
mma,
it has to be a long term proposition and

1495
01:06:04,121 --> 01:06:06,820
you should look at it as like,
what are your strength?

1496
01:06:07,090 --> 01:06:08,470
Your strength is Jujitsu.
Okay.

1497
01:06:08,471 --> 01:06:11,380
What's your weakness?
Your weakness is stand up.

1498
01:06:11,680 --> 01:06:13,060
Well,
you got to fix that.

1499
01:06:13,380 --> 01:06:18,380
You've got to fix that first.
You can't even think about getting in 

1500
01:06:18,380 --> 01:06:19,750
there unless you could fight in a 
kickboxing match because you're going to

1501
01:06:19,751 --> 01:06:21,910
be going right away to some of the 
highest level guys.

1502
01:06:21,950 --> 01:06:25,300
The world because you're hodrick racing.
They take a guy like that and they don't

1503
01:06:25,301 --> 01:06:27,940
like.
They don't move them along slow,

1504
01:06:28,170 --> 01:06:30,730
you know,
he's gonna fight high level guys because

1505
01:06:30,731 --> 01:06:34,480
of his name pretty quickly and because 
of his reputation in Jujitsu.

1506
01:06:34,840 --> 01:06:39,840
Whereas the reality of his striking is 
he's the one that is striking a few 

1507
01:06:39,840 --> 01:06:43,410
years.
You know you need many years on the 

1508
01:06:43,410 --> 01:06:45,691
books before you go and strike with a 
guy like the Leo Machida or something 

1509
01:06:45,691 --> 01:06:45,691
like that.

1510
01:06:45,691 --> 01:06:47,020
You just need a lot of years of the 
books.

1511
01:06:47,260 --> 01:06:49,630
You have to get them because he's going 
to light you up.

1512
01:06:49,950 --> 01:06:52,810
It's going to hit you with he's going to
pot shot you and he's going to crack you

1513
01:06:52,811 --> 01:06:57,811
and you're not going to stop him and 
he's going to hit you three or four 

1514
01:06:57,811 --> 01:06:58,660
times like that and he's gonna knock you
out too.

1515
01:06:58,690 --> 01:07:03,690
Sneaky game.
The striking game striking game is a 

1516
01:07:03,690 --> 01:07:04,690
different game.
Some guys can just adapt real quick.

1517
01:07:04,900 --> 01:07:08,290
Like there's some Dan Henderson type 
dudes that like almost right away within

1518
01:07:08,291 --> 01:07:13,291
a couple of years as dangerous as fuck,
but some who's just never quite get the 

1519
01:07:13,291 --> 01:07:13,291
hang of it.
Awesome.

1520
01:07:13,291 --> 01:07:18,130
Got picked up instantly and you see it.
You see what gets you guys are real.

1521
01:07:18,161 --> 01:07:22,810
Jujitsu guy is striking is very slow.
Sometimes it's a new saying,

1522
01:07:22,811 --> 01:07:25,180
wow,
is he in the octagon?

1523
01:07:25,181 --> 01:07:27,460
But maybe they know something.

1524
01:07:27,460 --> 01:07:32,460
I don't remember.
You went so side note something I 

1525
01:07:32,460 --> 01:07:32,460
thought.
Yeah,

1526
01:07:32,460 --> 01:07:35,560
well I think we're dealing with a new 
era of mixed martial arts.

1527
01:07:35,920 --> 01:07:37,270
I don't think people are ever going to 
try.

1528
01:07:37,271 --> 01:07:38,350
There's that,
that um,

1529
01:07:38,530 --> 01:07:41,080
although jump flying knee,
watch this,

1530
01:07:41,290 --> 01:07:46,290
boom.
That's like the first exchange of the 

1531
01:07:46,290 --> 01:07:46,290
fight.
He double flying knee them in the face.

1532
01:07:46,290 --> 01:07:48,250
It was insane.
Cut them,

1533
01:07:48,630 --> 01:07:51,490
cut them real bad over his eyebrow.
Look at that.

1534
01:07:53,140 --> 01:07:53,920
Yeah,
I mean,

1535
01:07:53,980 --> 01:07:58,980
but that's one of those things where 
they're send me anybody who gets hit by 

1536
01:07:58,980 --> 01:07:58,980
that,
that's a reality.

1537
01:07:58,980 --> 01:07:59,410
And we,
you know,

1538
01:07:59,470 --> 01:08:02,110
a lot of great guys don't get hit like 
that,

1539
01:08:02,111 --> 01:08:04,140
but if they did,
that's what would happen.

1540
01:08:04,580 --> 01:08:05,560
You know,
it's,

1541
01:08:05,590 --> 01:08:07,690
you can't avoid that.
That was a big lesson.

1542
01:08:08,070 --> 01:08:10,270
It's important lesson,
Saturday night,

1543
01:08:10,360 --> 01:08:15,360
important lesson for martial artist 
because people like to think that 

1544
01:08:15,360 --> 01:08:17,971
because the guy is really good that he 
can somehow or another magically take 

1545
01:08:17,971 --> 01:08:17,971
punishment better.

1546
01:08:17,971 --> 01:08:20,120
Not really.
So it's a fucking lesson for everybody.

1547
01:08:20,121 --> 01:08:21,770
Yeah.
That's a lesson for everything in life.

1548
01:08:22,160 --> 01:08:25,000
Karma is a motherfucker.
You see it in April,

1549
01:08:25,040 --> 01:08:28,610
you see it in basketball.
Sometimes you'll see a team that's got a

1550
01:08:28,611 --> 01:08:29,780
reputation,
the fast break,

1551
01:08:30,530 --> 01:08:33,140
and all of a sudden this team that 
nobody's talking about,

1552
01:08:33,141 --> 01:08:38,141
the fast break through,
they go into finals and the coaches say 

1553
01:08:38,141 --> 01:08:38,840
fast break breaking and the team that's 
been France breaking motherfuckers,

1554
01:08:39,110 --> 01:08:44,110
they know how to execute,
but they forget how to defend the fast 

1555
01:08:44,110 --> 01:08:44,110
break.
They fucking lose.

1556
01:08:44,110 --> 01:08:48,941
It happens all the time and the 
different types of sports in different 

1557
01:08:48,941 --> 01:08:48,941
situations.
Man,

1558
01:08:48,941 --> 01:08:52,360
the rematch is going to be absolutely 
fascinating to see what's going to 

1559
01:08:52,360 --> 01:08:53,990
happen.
Then to rematch with Weidman.

1560
01:08:53,991 --> 01:08:57,590
Anderson Silva will be the greatest 
worry match in the history of the UFC.

1561
01:08:57,950 --> 01:09:02,950
No doubt about it,
and everybody's going to want to know 

1562
01:09:02,950 --> 01:09:04,400
why men can do it again and everyone's 
going to want to know how Anderson going

1563
01:09:04,401 --> 01:09:07,220
to recover.
That's going to be fascinating as,

1564
01:09:07,221 --> 01:09:07,880
fuck,
man,

1565
01:09:08,630 --> 01:09:10,250
whew.
That's going to be crazy.

1566
01:09:12,260 --> 01:09:14,480
I can't write out a guy like Anderson 
Silva.

1567
01:09:14,500 --> 01:09:19,500
I'm right there with you watching.
Can't 17 fights and the three or two 

1568
01:09:19,500 --> 01:09:20,660
before that on Youtube,
whatever.

1569
01:09:20,661 --> 01:09:23,060
You can't write this guy off.
You cannot write him off.

1570
01:09:23,330 --> 01:09:24,470
But then,
however,

1571
01:09:24,620 --> 01:09:26,930
however we seen it with a lot of other 
fighters,

1572
01:09:26,960 --> 01:09:29,600
age takes whatever the money,
the children,

1573
01:09:29,601 --> 01:09:30,360
you know,
it's,

1574
01:09:30,390 --> 01:09:35,390
it's a new wage.
I can't wait to see today I saw a 

1575
01:09:35,390 --> 01:09:35,990
picture of this gift to Sin Against Jon 
Jones,

1576
01:09:35,991 --> 01:09:36,850
the fucking,
uh,

1577
01:09:37,330 --> 01:09:38,900
the whatever.
Look at that fight.

1578
01:09:38,901 --> 01:09:41,410
Those are two monsters.
Monsters.

1579
01:09:41,930 --> 01:09:42,950
Yeah.
Well,

1580
01:09:42,951 --> 01:09:47,951
you know,
and one of the things about a guy like 

1581
01:09:47,951 --> 01:09:50,471
Anderson,
we're comparing them to a guy like 

1582
01:09:50,471 --> 01:09:50,471
Bernard Hopkins,
just 10 years older than him.

1583
01:09:50,471 --> 01:09:52,700
Watch out Bernard fights.
Bernard Hopkins is a brilliant defensive

1584
01:09:52,701 --> 01:09:53,660
fighter.
Brilliant.

1585
01:09:53,840 --> 01:09:56,510
You very rarely see Bernard Hopkins Kit 
clipped,

1586
01:09:57,080 --> 01:09:58,370
you know,
and when he gets clipped,

1587
01:09:58,430 --> 01:10:01,100
his boxing is good enough that he knows 
how to go into a shell.

1588
01:10:01,220 --> 01:10:06,220
He knows how to move.
He knows how to give you angles and he 

1589
01:10:06,220 --> 01:10:06,500
gets away with Shit.
He's got a good channel and he gets away

1590
01:10:06,501 --> 01:10:11,501
with Shit.
And one of the reasons why it's got a 

1591
01:10:11,501 --> 01:10:11,501
good chin as he hasn't taken a beating 
ever.

1592
01:10:11,501 --> 01:10:12,680
He's never taken a beating his entire 
career.

1593
01:10:12,930 --> 01:10:17,930
You know Bernard Hopkins,
like he kept a skills pass any of the 

1594
01:10:17,930 --> 01:10:19,640
fighters of his prime.
I think about his fight with Roy Jones,

1595
01:10:19,641 --> 01:10:21,650
Jr Acumen.
Roy Jones Jr.

1596
01:10:21,651 --> 01:10:25,910
They duked it out once and roy beat him,
but when they do to the second time,

1597
01:10:26,090 --> 01:10:31,090
bernard hopkins basically just like box 
box box them up because bernard's skills

1598
01:10:32,840 --> 01:10:37,840
hadn't deteriorated like roy's reflexes.
Like roy's skills were so reflex based.

1599
01:10:39,380 --> 01:10:42,770
He was so speed and reflex based,
in my opinion.

1600
01:10:42,950 --> 01:10:46,970
He was The scariest boxer that you would
ever have to compete against.

1601
01:10:47,110 --> 01:10:49,640
I mean,
Mike Tyson was ferocious and terrifying,

1602
01:10:49,820 --> 01:10:51,380
so I shouldn't say he was man.

1603
01:10:51,590 --> 01:10:53,330
It was close cbc,
obviously.

1604
01:10:53,331 --> 01:10:58,331
I was actually a line in an a nas song.
This is welcome to the new world.

1605
01:10:59,210 --> 01:11:02,030
The new mike tyson's Roy Jones.
That was [inaudible].

1606
01:11:02,240 --> 01:11:04,940
Roy jones was just knocking everyone 
silly.

1607
01:11:04,970 --> 01:11:06,800
He didn't do it the same way that tyson 
did.

1608
01:11:07,160 --> 01:11:12,160
He did it with just like speed and 
ridiculous combinations and insane 

1609
01:11:12,160 --> 01:11:17,021
accuracy.
He could just move in a way that other 

1610
01:11:17,021 --> 01:11:19,911
dudes couldn't move.
Like if you go back and watch his 

1611
01:11:19,911 --> 01:11:20,310
highlight Reels,
god damn,

1612
01:11:20,311 --> 01:11:24,240
he was amazing.
But he fought like this weird style with

1613
01:11:24,241 --> 01:11:27,300
your hands down and he didn't throw a 
lot of jabs.

1614
01:11:27,301 --> 01:11:30,360
He threw like a leaping left hook,
but he was so fast with it.

1615
01:11:30,361 --> 01:11:33,150
He would just catch guys on a chin and 
he would light them up with it.

1616
01:11:33,151 --> 01:11:34,890
He threw a lot of lead,
right hands.

1617
01:11:35,040 --> 01:11:40,040
He had like a different style and his 
style was based on his ability to cover 

1618
01:11:40,040 --> 01:11:40,440
ground and his accuracy.

1619
01:11:40,770 --> 01:11:45,770
And as soon as they started getting 
older and starting getting hit and 

1620
01:11:45,770 --> 01:11:48,471
slowed down,
that style was like and now actually a 

1621
01:11:48,471 --> 01:11:50,160
detriment.
And so he stopped being offensive.

1622
01:11:50,550 --> 01:11:54,330
Like one of the most disheartening 
things about watching Roy Jones jr fight

1623
01:11:54,331 --> 01:11:56,850
now.
It's not that he's still fighting,

1624
01:11:57,180 --> 01:12:00,060
is that he's not hurting anybody.
Like can you watch him fight?

1625
01:12:00,090 --> 01:12:00,720
He's,
he's.

1626
01:12:00,860 --> 01:12:04,410
He has to be much more defensive.
He's been knocked out a few times now.

1627
01:12:04,500 --> 01:12:08,460
So now it's like his boxing is almost 
like he's boxing,

1628
01:12:08,660 --> 01:12:11,400
she's trying to win,
but he's also trying to knock it knocked

1629
01:12:11,401 --> 01:12:12,480
out.
How old is he though?

1630
01:12:12,920 --> 01:12:15,800
I believe he's 40 of does.
He owes money.

1631
01:12:16,520 --> 01:12:17,670
Yeah.
He wants to get an mma,

1632
01:12:17,730 --> 01:12:22,730
that's what the word is.
there was an article about some tax 

1633
01:12:22,730 --> 01:12:23,310
issues and some,
you know,

1634
01:12:23,550 --> 01:12:27,270
I would imagine that he thinks that 
there's some good money for them and mma

1635
01:12:27,510 --> 01:12:31,410
and even at his age,
all the fights that he's Been in and the

1636
01:12:31,440 --> 01:12:36,440
toll that that takes on your body,
his boxing skills are so far and above 

1637
01:12:36,440 --> 01:12:39,150
tHe average mma fighter that it would be
kind of interesting.

1638
01:12:39,780 --> 01:12:42,150
Especially if you give a guy like Roy 
Jones jr,

1639
01:12:42,151 --> 01:12:47,151
little tiny gloves.
Think how fast he has his regular 

1640
01:12:47,151 --> 01:12:47,151
gloves.
You know,

1641
01:12:47,151 --> 01:12:51,530
I mean imagine give manny pacquiao,
little mma gloves and imagine how quick 

1642
01:12:52,511 --> 01:12:55,320
he's punching you in the face and could 
you even see it coming?

1643
01:12:55,350 --> 01:12:57,150
I mean,
how do you stop that?

1644
01:12:57,370 --> 01:13:01,260
It was like four ounces on them as 
opposed to the,

1645
01:13:01,290 --> 01:13:04,230
what is it,
six or eight he's wearing regular basis.

1646
01:13:04,410 --> 01:13:09,410
That's a big difference man.
Those little tiny knuckle gloves as a 

1647
01:13:09,410 --> 01:13:10,800
big difference.
If a guy like manny pacquiao got an mma,

1648
01:13:13,800 --> 01:13:16,200
teach them how to teach them some 
butterfly guard,

1649
01:13:16,201 --> 01:13:18,360
how sprawl,
how to get back to your feet.

1650
01:13:19,550 --> 01:13:22,830
It's work with them on that for a couple
of years and set them loose.

1651
01:13:23,050 --> 01:13:25,500
Is many though.
It's a good question.

1652
01:13:26,280 --> 01:13:27,280
He's in his thirties,
right?

1653
01:13:27,850 --> 01:13:29,220
Go do six.
Manny pacquiao.

1654
01:13:31,460 --> 01:13:33,620
How old is manolo packy owl?

1655
01:13:33,790 --> 01:13:34,860
Yeah.
Don't be a dick.

1656
01:13:35,930 --> 01:13:40,930
Right?
Would you like me to search the web for 

1657
01:13:40,930 --> 01:13:41,510
searching the web for?
How old is he?

1658
01:13:43,510 --> 01:13:44,970
Fuck,
fuck.

1659
01:13:45,900 --> 01:13:48,570
He was born December 17th.
He's 34,

1660
01:13:49,600 --> 01:13:50,580
man.
No,

1661
01:13:50,581 --> 01:13:51,510
he's not.
No,

1662
01:13:51,511 --> 01:13:53,310
he's not.
Not in the world of boxing.

1663
01:13:53,910 --> 01:13:55,800
The world of boxing is a different 
world.

1664
01:13:56,100 --> 01:13:59,220
There's only a few.
Bernard hopkins is a matter of fact.

1665
01:13:59,280 --> 01:14:00,900
He's the only one that I can even think 
of.

1666
01:14:01,110 --> 01:14:06,110
There's no one else that's managed to 
keep their career going that deep into 

1667
01:14:06,110 --> 01:14:09,291
their forties.
No one in the world of boxing dirty for 

1668
01:14:09,291 --> 01:14:10,020
saying is he hasn't taken a lot of.
Yes,

1669
01:14:10,050 --> 01:14:15,050
he has.
He's been in some wars and that last 

1670
01:14:15,050 --> 01:14:15,970
knockout,
that one walmart has knocked out.

1671
01:14:16,030 --> 01:14:19,840
That's a career changer.
It's a career change because he ran into

1672
01:14:19,841 --> 01:14:23,530
a telephone pole right hand.
I mean literally ran into it,

1673
01:14:23,650 --> 01:14:28,650
so it was him moving forward really fast
and mark has catching them on the button

1674
01:14:28,990 --> 01:14:31,510
and they had two wars before that where 
they dropped each other.

1675
01:14:31,750 --> 01:14:36,750
So those guys have had,
he's gone through those fights and then 

1676
01:14:36,750 --> 01:14:37,390
the fight,
he lost his bradley.

1677
01:14:37,540 --> 01:14:39,880
There wasn't a war,
but it was a tough fight,

1678
01:14:40,150 --> 01:14:45,150
you know.
But if you go like back to like some of 

1679
01:14:45,150 --> 01:14:45,150
his,
uh,

1680
01:14:45,150 --> 01:14:46,150
his fights before then,
you know,

1681
01:14:46,180 --> 01:14:47,800
he,
he'd been in some crazy fights.

1682
01:14:47,801 --> 01:14:50,260
I mean,
even though he still winning and looking

1683
01:14:50,261 --> 01:14:51,530
spectacular,
you know,

1684
01:14:51,531 --> 01:14:55,150
there,
there's some wild exchanges ready for.

1685
01:14:56,860 --> 01:14:59,110
Yeah.
And you know,

1686
01:14:59,170 --> 01:15:04,170
who knows,
I mean there was also like rampant 

1687
01:15:04,170 --> 01:15:04,570
speculation of performance enhancing 
substances.

1688
01:15:04,810 --> 01:15:07,000
I don't know if that's true or not,
you know.

1689
01:15:07,030 --> 01:15:09,520
And then there's always the question,
are they,

1690
01:15:09,700 --> 01:15:11,230
when,
when fighters do those things,

1691
01:15:11,231 --> 01:15:12,440
it's like,
um,

1692
01:15:12,500 --> 01:15:16,270
I think going to continue to do them,
how are they going to like regulate it?

1693
01:15:16,440 --> 01:15:17,530
How,
how do they.

1694
01:15:17,531 --> 01:15:21,370
Like when you hit really high peaks,
like performance enhancing drug peaks,

1695
01:15:21,730 --> 01:15:24,820
the real issue is if they are doing 
something illegal,

1696
01:15:25,060 --> 01:15:29,050
how are they going to maintain that 
level and will they maintain that level?

1697
01:15:29,050 --> 01:15:32,470
It's an artificial level so it's like 
you're going to go ups and downs,

1698
01:15:32,471 --> 01:15:37,471
you've got to take time off in between 
doing it and you gotta make sure you 

1699
01:15:37,471 --> 01:15:38,500
catch it right and sometimes they don't 
and when they don't,

1700
01:15:38,501 --> 01:15:43,501
you know,
you'll see like real ins consistencies 

1701
01:15:43,501 --> 01:15:43,501
and their performance.
You see them when they looked absolutely

1702
01:15:43,501 --> 01:15:48,211
sensational and then you see them when 
they're in this like little spot in 

1703
01:15:48,211 --> 01:15:49,780
between cycles.
Who's not doing drugs?

1704
01:15:49,840 --> 01:15:51,850
Can you please tell me it's a good 
question.

1705
01:15:51,880 --> 01:15:53,590
Who's not doing drugs?
It's a good question.

1706
01:15:53,591 --> 01:15:55,240
I think a lot of fighters aren't doing 
drugs.

1707
01:15:55,241 --> 01:15:57,400
I know bj penn,
I don't say I know,

1708
01:15:57,430 --> 01:16:02,430
but I'm pretty sure.
I mean I don't think he would lie about 

1709
01:16:02,430 --> 01:16:04,981
that.
That's part of his whole honor with the 

1710
01:16:04,981 --> 01:16:05,430
whole fight game.
And john fitch I think is another one.

1711
01:16:05,431 --> 01:16:06,850
I don't think john fitch has ever done 
anything.

1712
01:16:06,850 --> 01:16:11,850
I personally talked to them about it and
he said he would never be able to live 

1713
01:16:11,850 --> 01:16:13,030
with himself if you know.
He knew that he got there because he was

1714
01:16:13,031 --> 01:16:18,031
doing something.
He was using something that dude got 

1715
01:16:18,031 --> 01:16:21,570
really far with,
just like fucking grittiness and 

1716
01:16:21,570 --> 01:16:22,060
toughness and will,
you know,

1717
01:16:22,630 --> 01:16:25,930
without any enhancement to his body 
artificial.

1718
01:16:26,050 --> 01:16:28,180
But there's a lot of folks out there 
that do do it.

1719
01:16:29,110 --> 01:16:34,110
I don't know how many you wouldn't know 
unless you're there with them is all 

1720
01:16:34,110 --> 01:16:35,170
speculation because some guys just have 
sensational genetics.

1721
01:16:35,530 --> 01:16:39,040
Some guys are just,
they're just unbelievably robust and the

1722
01:16:39,041 --> 01:16:42,400
heel quik and they look great and you 
would swear that they're on something.

1723
01:16:42,401 --> 01:16:44,590
But then on john shit,
you know,

1724
01:16:45,250 --> 01:16:49,030
which is part of the weird arguments 
because like not everybody is born.

1725
01:16:49,240 --> 01:16:51,070
Like everybody says it's an even playing
field,

1726
01:16:51,460 --> 01:16:53,080
but it's not,
you know,

1727
01:16:53,081 --> 01:16:55,110
if you're fighting,
you're fighting jon jones,

1728
01:16:55,210 --> 01:16:58,210
five foot two.
There's no evil even playing field.

1729
01:16:58,240 --> 01:16:59,230
Oh,
you both weighed two.

1730
01:16:59,231 --> 01:16:59,780
Oh,
five.

1731
01:16:59,800 --> 01:17:00,730
Yeah,
she'll be fine.

1732
01:17:00,970 --> 01:17:03,760
There's not an even playing field.
You're crazy.

1733
01:17:03,761 --> 01:17:06,160
He has a super body.
You can't even have a chance.

1734
01:17:06,460 --> 01:17:11,460
It's not even,
and there's nothing you can do by the 

1735
01:17:11,460 --> 01:17:13,891
way,
you can take all the steroids in the 

1736
01:17:13,891 --> 01:17:13,891
world.
You're never going to beat John Jones.

1737
01:17:13,891 --> 01:17:15,560
He said the mechanical advantage of his 
frame and his athleticism,

1738
01:17:15,830 --> 01:17:20,830
the average guy.
It's never gonna be able to fuck with 

1739
01:17:20,830 --> 01:17:20,830
that.

1740
01:17:20,830 --> 01:17:22,370
Every actor over 50 right now in 
hollywood shooting fucking shit.

1741
01:17:22,850 --> 01:17:25,690
Musicians on the,
toward doing the 60 and 70.

1742
01:17:26,550 --> 01:17:29,000
Well,
most of the guys I think used the cream.

1743
01:17:29,090 --> 01:17:29,720
They use,
uh,

1744
01:17:29,740 --> 01:17:30,520
the,
you see those,

1745
01:17:30,740 --> 01:17:33,890
those cream ads,
testosterone cream a little bit.

1746
01:17:34,130 --> 01:17:39,130
This is going to be huge.
There's a spray or an oral spray because

1747
01:17:39,411 --> 01:17:40,550
it good.
Yes.

1748
01:17:40,670 --> 01:17:42,290
That's going to be the next one.
Yes.

1749
01:17:42,291 --> 01:17:47,291
Apparently the absorption rate is even 
better than I'm rubbing it on your skin.

1750
01:17:48,171 --> 01:17:53,171
The transdermal method,
it's better when you put it in your 

1751
01:17:53,171 --> 01:17:55,421
mouth.
He spray like you give yourself a shot 

1752
01:17:55,421 --> 01:17:55,421
in the morning with cliq.
You know,

1753
01:17:55,421 --> 01:17:57,800
you're a mouthwash,
do your mouthwash and then give yourself

1754
01:17:57,801 --> 01:18:01,030
a shot of testosterone and you're off on
your way to a cream.

1755
01:18:01,060 --> 01:18:06,060
You have to rub all over your whole 
entire body or you rub it on your upper 

1756
01:18:06,060 --> 01:18:07,100
arms and shoulders.
What if you just more your not with it.

1757
01:18:07,130 --> 01:18:09,710
You could masturbate with it,
I guess to help anything maybe,

1758
01:18:09,990 --> 01:18:14,990
but what if you cleaned up and you 
accidentally cleaned up your test cream 

1759
01:18:14,990 --> 01:18:15,950
because you thought it was just you 
would waste some of your tests.

1760
01:18:15,951 --> 01:18:17,770
Cream.
I've been last year at dirty bastard.

1761
01:18:17,771 --> 01:18:22,771
He's just not all of yourself and then 
pull your underwear over it and let it 

1762
01:18:22,771 --> 01:18:24,560
all cook liberal.
All stu inside your your ball sack area.

1763
01:18:24,710 --> 01:18:28,700
I've been masturbating with monistat 
once a week now because it keeps your pe

1764
01:18:28,710 --> 01:18:32,060
or levels down your levels of what aid.

1765
01:18:34,560 --> 01:18:38,910
What is monistat first of all is that 
some women use for yeast infections?

1766
01:18:38,911 --> 01:18:39,520
Yeah,
absolutely.

1767
01:18:39,550 --> 01:18:44,550
What is wrong with you?
Because I found out that you can have 

1768
01:18:44,550 --> 01:18:46,950
guys have yeast infections and that's 
why if you have sex with a girl and she 

1769
01:18:46,950 --> 01:18:50,401
has a yeast infection,
a lot of times you gave it to her 

1770
01:18:50,401 --> 01:18:50,710
because you have don't have usually any 
symptoms.

1771
01:18:50,800 --> 01:18:55,800
So one of the things to get rid of that 
is put monistat on your dick and around 

1772
01:18:55,800 --> 01:18:57,880
your balls and around that shit at least
once a month,

1773
01:18:57,940 --> 01:18:59,770
but he's like every 20 minutes.

1774
01:19:00,810 --> 01:19:05,810
Here's the weirdest joe rogan 94.
It was an open my comment that was 

1775
01:19:05,810 --> 01:19:10,101
getting divorced and I moved to New York
and I would work in the city and that 

1776
01:19:10,101 --> 01:19:10,101
was on the coke and I had this in child 
support.

1777
01:19:10,101 --> 01:19:14,871
I just couldn't make it all work.
So part of my angle every morning I get 

1778
01:19:14,871 --> 01:19:15,150
a suit Before I went to work in the 
city,

1779
01:19:15,510 --> 01:19:20,510
I go to fort lee amp right there by the 
George Washington bridge and they just 

1780
01:19:20,510 --> 01:19:22,650
finished stocking the shelves and I had 
a briefcase like a bookcase.

1781
01:19:22,660 --> 01:19:27,660
I was a businessman in the city and I'd 
put monistat now in the cases and a 

1782
01:19:28,650 --> 01:19:30,720
monistat and there was something else 
they liked,

1783
01:19:30,730 --> 01:19:35,730
like a.
Not the little aspects but the big 

1784
01:19:35,730 --> 01:19:37,821
aspirins.
I like walk over the George Washington 

1785
01:19:37,821 --> 01:19:40,761
bridge,
take them to a bodega and that's all 

1786
01:19:40,761 --> 01:19:40,800
they would buy from you is yeast 
infection medication.

1787
01:19:41,250 --> 01:19:43,440
That's what they tell you when you 
brought them.

1788
01:19:43,441 --> 01:19:44,550
Shit.
I keep bringing it.

1789
01:19:45,090 --> 01:19:45,810
That's the most of them.

1790
01:19:45,840 --> 01:19:50,840
One thing up in spanish harlem,
so I would walk over the bridge.

1791
01:19:51,351 --> 01:19:52,520
I got like 60,
70 yeaRs.

1792
01:19:52,520 --> 01:19:52,830
Any books

1793
01:19:52,840 --> 01:19:54,020
in those days?
I was an open mic.

1794
01:19:54,021 --> 01:19:59,021
I didn't give a fuck.
I was just going over there just enough 

1795
01:19:59,021 --> 01:19:59,120
to have money to get a hot dog,
a bag of weed and do whatever.

1796
01:19:59,480 --> 01:20:01,400
That's how crazy they were.
The guys would say,

1797
01:20:01,700 --> 01:20:04,360
make sure it's the monistat.
Bring the monistat seven.

1798
01:20:04,400 --> 01:20:07,010
It says an amazing how much people 
identify with their.

1799
01:20:07,770 --> 01:20:08,160
Because

1800
01:20:08,160 --> 01:20:13,160
there's a thing that women hate more 
than not want more than anything is 

1801
01:20:13,160 --> 01:20:17,421
left.
I mean that's a massive generalization 

1802
01:20:17,421 --> 01:20:19,431
that has taught myself,
but there's one thing that a lot of 

1803
01:20:19,431 --> 01:20:21,000
women really do not appreciate and 
that's stinky pussy jokes.

1804
01:20:22,570 --> 01:20:24,900
You know,
you could talk about your stinky feet,

1805
01:20:25,140 --> 01:20:30,140
who can talk about a girl,
stinky feet and talk about a girl's 

1806
01:20:30,140 --> 01:20:30,140
breath.
You can talk about our girls,

1807
01:20:30,140 --> 01:20:34,470
but you can't talk about a girl stinky 
pussy to them.

1808
01:20:34,471 --> 01:20:39,471
You can lose a lot of people that don't 
like when you talk about even onstage 

1809
01:20:39,471 --> 01:20:39,471
really like,
yes,

1810
01:20:39,471 --> 01:20:39,471
yes,
yes.

1811
01:20:39,471 --> 01:20:42,210
I've seen someone do a stinky pussy joke
and then I've seen women in the audience

1812
01:20:42,211 --> 01:20:43,080
going,
oh,

1813
01:20:43,081 --> 01:20:48,060
come on.
Just upset that you put that possibility

1814
01:20:48,061 --> 01:20:51,780
out there.
I've never smelled a bad fucking pussy.

1815
01:20:51,781 --> 01:20:54,840
Like when people did a lot of coke.
No,

1816
01:20:54,870 --> 01:20:59,870
no,
he knows that like I'm a fucking gets 

1817
01:20:59,870 --> 01:20:59,870
that.

1818
01:20:59,870 --> 01:21:00,240
If I pick up a chicken barn,
she's great.

1819
01:21:00,241 --> 01:21:01,830
I'm thinking I'm going to take,
take a shower.

1820
01:21:02,190 --> 01:21:04,000
It's not going to help.
I just,

1821
01:21:04,180 --> 01:21:06,490
it it help us.
No,

1822
01:21:06,690 --> 01:21:11,690
no,
but I finger banged a girl in Idaho 

1823
01:21:11,690 --> 01:21:13,230
falls and indian and american indian I 
finger.

1824
01:21:13,231 --> 01:21:18,120
She had those daisy dukes on triple one 
night is and I'm all warmed up.

1825
01:21:18,790 --> 01:21:21,860
I got like $32.
I got no blow budweiser.

1826
01:21:22,570 --> 01:21:25,020
Fucking furious.
I'm dancing on the edge.

1827
01:21:25,040 --> 01:21:28,680
She's letting me touch her joe rogan and
I stick my hand in like this way,

1828
01:21:28,681 --> 01:21:31,800
like full finger.
Oh my fucking twat.

1829
01:21:32,130 --> 01:21:37,130
And I had that fucking yoga look at the 
size of his and I was bringing up this 

1830
01:21:37,171 --> 01:21:38,660
way.
You know Bruce Lee,

1831
01:21:38,661 --> 01:21:43,661
you know I was that.
I stopped and I took it out to call 

1832
01:21:44,580 --> 01:21:45,050
them.
I could.

1833
01:21:45,120 --> 01:21:49,110
I was dancing with it.
I could smell my hand and that was it.

1834
01:21:49,110 --> 01:21:53,730
I remember just fucking go do some sad 
moments and you can't get it off.

1835
01:21:53,830 --> 01:21:57,720
Do you know that the smell of fish is 
actually from old come usually.

1836
01:21:57,721 --> 01:22:00,020
So if it's a really strong a fish 
smelled,

1837
01:22:00,030 --> 01:22:05,030
that means there's common inside of her.
That's funny because that's what my is 

1838
01:22:05,030 --> 01:22:05,820
always smelled like.
If I jerk off and don't wipe up,

1839
01:22:06,480 --> 01:22:11,010
smells like fish.
Don't realize I'm bethesda.

1840
01:22:11,040 --> 01:22:16,040
I used to take up my own jazz.
I shoot sheet and my pubes and pull my 

1841
01:22:16,501 --> 01:22:16,860
underwear.
I,

1842
01:22:16,870 --> 01:22:21,870
by the way,
I've done that dozens of times in my 

1843
01:22:21,870 --> 01:22:21,870
life to just.
Once I shoot of,

1844
01:22:21,870 --> 01:22:24,120
I jerk off,
I just shoot a load on my pubes.

1845
01:22:24,121 --> 01:22:26,370
I don't even bother cleaning it up.
I just pull my underwear up.

1846
01:22:26,520 --> 01:22:27,870
I do that.
Especially when I'm in the house.

1847
01:22:27,871 --> 01:22:28,860
I'm like,
as long as it's covered,

1848
01:22:28,861 --> 01:22:29,610
what do I give a fuck?

1849
01:22:29,640 --> 01:22:33,810
If I'm in the hotel room by myself,
I'll get cares who cares.

1850
01:22:33,860 --> 01:22:37,450
Bandwidth on the bed and laid on it.
I don't give a fuck all day.

1851
01:22:37,451 --> 01:22:38,190
It's like,
oh,

1852
01:22:39,020 --> 01:22:43,410
this is my little tropical helmet juice,
but that was the only time I really ever

1853
01:22:43,411 --> 01:22:48,411
like.
I dated a chick that one before I 

1854
01:22:48,411 --> 01:22:48,411
started dating.
The chick was a little proof just when I

1855
01:22:48,411 --> 01:22:48,810
was like 19,
20.

1856
01:22:49,260 --> 01:22:51,750
I didn't know what to expect to have a 
pussy smell.

1857
01:22:51,751 --> 01:22:53,330
Oh my goodness.
She took care of it.

1858
01:22:53,331 --> 01:22:54,380
What happened?
No,

1859
01:22:54,530 --> 01:22:57,240
that you took care of it.
It was good.

1860
01:22:57,630 --> 01:23:00,480
I wouLd sniff it and everything.
Never sniffed nothing.

1861
01:23:00,570 --> 01:23:01,560
It was delicious.
I,

1862
01:23:01,610 --> 01:23:03,510
I,
I knew a giRl when I was young and had a

1863
01:23:03,511 --> 01:23:05,360
problem.
Did you say something to him?

1864
01:23:05,440 --> 01:23:06,040
No,
I did

1865
01:23:06,040 --> 01:23:07,480
not.
I was too.

1866
01:23:07,510 --> 01:23:12,510
I couldn't.
I mean it was those back then when you 

1867
01:23:12,510 --> 01:23:15,121
know,
when you're in your teenage years and 

1868
01:23:15,121 --> 01:23:15,121
you fooling around,
you know what the hell you're doing.

1869
01:23:15,121 --> 01:23:15,640
The last thing I'd do is start bringing 
things up.

1870
01:23:15,670 --> 01:23:17,500
Did you keep eating it though?
Oh no.

1871
01:23:17,501 --> 01:23:18,970
There was none of that.
No,

1872
01:23:18,990 --> 01:23:21,010
there's none of that going on.
She didn't want you to do that.

1873
01:23:21,011 --> 01:23:23,950
She knew something was wrong,
but it was just like,

1874
01:23:24,010 --> 01:23:27,150
it was one of those things where I bet 
she was catholic girl.

1875
01:23:27,160 --> 01:23:28,900
I better parents and talk to her about 
it.

1876
01:23:28,901 --> 01:23:33,901
I bet she had no idea and I bet she 
thought that's just what they smelled 

1877
01:23:33,901 --> 01:23:33,901
like,
you know,

1878
01:23:33,901 --> 01:23:34,390
and it was,
it was unfortunate.

1879
01:23:34,450 --> 01:23:36,850
You know,
she figured it out later though later in

1880
01:23:36,851 --> 01:23:38,790
life,
like while you up and told you no,

1881
01:23:38,800 --> 01:23:39,250
no,
no,

1882
01:23:39,260 --> 01:23:41,450
I,
I hooked up with her later when I was in

1883
01:23:41,451 --> 01:23:44,620
like in my twenties,
like once and I was like,

1884
01:23:44,621 --> 01:23:46,060
oh,
it's all cleaned up now.

1885
01:23:47,680 --> 01:23:52,680
Imagine if it still is a mess.
Like longest running yeast infection 

1886
01:23:52,680 --> 01:23:53,500
ever.
No one ever talked to her.

1887
01:23:53,501 --> 01:23:55,630
It was just like always this thing that 
was never discussed.

1888
01:23:56,450 --> 01:24:01,450
Some have a pre judge.
If you judge a woman to go chick's 

1889
01:24:01,450 --> 01:24:01,450
pussy,
stuff.

1890
01:24:01,450 --> 01:24:05,710
Like sometimes I look at a woman,
I got a guy with your pussy smell 

1891
01:24:05,710 --> 01:24:05,710
fucking horrible,
you know,

1892
01:24:05,710 --> 01:24:06,960
harassed.
I can look at the chicken guy.

1893
01:24:06,990 --> 01:24:08,190
Yeah.
Pete harassed most.

1894
01:24:08,540 --> 01:24:11,020
Seeing a girl that took a sloppy drunk 
with dirty feet.

1895
01:24:11,021 --> 01:24:12,430
You got to imagine that something going 
on.

1896
01:24:12,480 --> 01:24:17,480
I always go by weight usually because 
the bigger girls have a worst smell 

1897
01:24:17,480 --> 01:24:18,550
because they could be like trying to 
clean their pussy for like the last five

1898
01:24:18,551 --> 01:24:20,410
years and was like the crack.
Yeah,

1899
01:24:20,411 --> 01:24:23,920
but I gave this italian skinny chick 
that had a little wine gum monkey when I

1900
01:24:23,921 --> 01:24:24,340
was a kid.

1901
01:24:24,340 --> 01:24:28,660
I mean it didn't stop me from eating.
She was skinny.

1902
01:24:29,380 --> 01:24:32,380
She had to be like 90 pounds,
but a pussy weighed 60.

1903
01:24:32,640 --> 01:24:36,370
She was one of those checks and she was 
italian so it smelled like fucking.

1904
01:24:36,371 --> 01:24:38,220
It was tremendous.
Like melissa,

1905
01:24:39,990 --> 01:24:44,990
by the way,
because when you're in the citadel and 

1906
01:24:44,990 --> 01:24:46,800
salami,
I'm the block from that fucking cuban 

1907
01:24:46,800 --> 01:24:49,291
joint.
You turned me on tHat domingo's ain't 

1908
01:24:49,291 --> 01:24:49,291
bad.
Huh?

1909
01:24:49,291 --> 01:24:50,830
Is it after then I got the meatball 
sandwich.

1910
01:24:50,831 --> 01:24:52,450
I could call him red salad.
Where's that?

1911
01:24:52,451 --> 01:24:54,160
Is it like a deli?
But yeah,

1912
01:24:54,430 --> 01:24:59,380
right up the block from fucking ventura.
The mangoes.

1913
01:24:59,381 --> 01:25:01,960
I went there the other day.
Good restaurants on that street.

1914
01:25:02,800 --> 01:25:03,720
Not a good restaurant.
Oh.

1915
01:25:03,730 --> 01:25:05,890
Somebody was telling me that I haven't 
been taught by my house,

1916
01:25:05,891 --> 01:25:07,690
like studio sets were invented.
Sushi.

1917
01:25:07,691 --> 01:25:08,890
Is that true?
No.

1918
01:25:09,090 --> 01:25:10,380
people like bro.
That's where they.

1919
01:25:12,200 --> 01:25:14,910
Sushi in Japan?
No,

1920
01:25:15,120 --> 01:25:17,430
no.
Right.

1921
01:25:18,290 --> 01:25:20,930
Tying all your life.
When did you eat your body of breadth?

1922
01:25:20,950 --> 01:25:22,810
A year ago.
You know what I'm saying?

1923
01:25:22,820 --> 01:25:27,820
You never eat your bread shit that they 
invent now that even the fucking people 

1924
01:25:28,461 --> 01:25:33,461
going,
the mexicans taco bell and vents more 

1925
01:25:33,461 --> 01:25:36,100
shit to lupus.
Lupus mexicans.

1926
01:25:36,110 --> 01:25:37,990
Like what the fuck are they talking 
about?

1927
01:25:38,200 --> 01:25:39,570
So you never know anymore.
I don't know.

1928
01:25:40,670 --> 01:25:41,510
Van nuys?
Yeah.

1929
01:25:41,511 --> 01:25:43,220
What's what?
Taco bell doing?

1930
01:25:43,221 --> 01:25:48,221
Commercials where they have chefs 
pretending that the flavor has to be 

1931
01:25:48,221 --> 01:25:48,980
just right.
Like they have a shit.

1932
01:25:48,981 --> 01:25:53,420
Don't put anything online.
Don't get us to famous images.

1933
01:25:53,510 --> 01:25:54,900
But you know that commercial.
I thought you were

1934
01:25:55,570 --> 01:25:59,350
the little lady with a mexican woman who
smelling vegetables.

1935
01:25:59,550 --> 01:26:04,550
Really?
I'm going to make sure that you smelled 

1936
01:26:04,550 --> 01:26:04,550
fucking vegetables.

1937
01:26:04,750 --> 01:26:06,410
Fucking radiation shit.

1938
01:26:06,900 --> 01:26:09,180
Yeah.
Who does that also as a dominoes?

1939
01:26:09,210 --> 01:26:14,210
Like have you had dominant with frozen 
pizza crust with shitty sauce?

1940
01:26:16,620 --> 01:26:18,660
Is domino's frozen?
Frozen?

1941
01:26:18,661 --> 01:26:20,700
I don't think anybody does that,
but yeah,

1942
01:26:20,701 --> 01:26:22,520
the garden,
all of our gardens.

1943
01:26:22,540 --> 01:26:23,840
Food is frozen.
Is it?

1944
01:26:23,880 --> 01:26:24,810
I think so.
I think.

1945
01:26:24,811 --> 01:26:29,811
Come on.
I think that what what the story is is 

1946
01:26:29,811 --> 01:26:32,451
that they get like,
like things like almost like a frozen 

1947
01:26:32,451 --> 01:26:34,030
food where they just kind of follow it 
out on noodles like that.

1948
01:26:34,130 --> 01:26:36,120
The whole thing is frozen.
Get the fuck out of here.

1949
01:26:36,121 --> 01:26:41,121
Do you can't say that unless you know 
for sure we can get tragically xapi or 

1950
01:26:41,121 --> 01:26:41,550
allegedly you gotta stop doing that.
Dude.

1951
01:26:41,551 --> 01:26:42,570
You're gonna.
Get people sued.

1952
01:26:42,840 --> 01:26:44,670
Google it.
You can't just say,

1953
01:26:44,671 --> 01:26:49,671
the all garden does that.
You're tHe one who's always talking 

1954
01:26:49,671 --> 01:26:49,671
about the fucking off guard.
Like it's so awesome.

1955
01:26:49,671 --> 01:26:53,190
Now you're turning on them.
This is a classic case of a relationship

1956
01:26:53,191 --> 01:26:58,191
gone bad.
People get used to each other and then 

1957
01:26:58,191 --> 01:27:00,831
they turn on them.
At one time you were my love and now I 

1958
01:27:00,831 --> 01:27:02,790
hate you.
The truth behind their school.

1959
01:27:02,850 --> 01:27:05,070
Well you read up on that and get back 
later.

1960
01:27:05,580 --> 01:27:10,580
Read it up.
Can't be defaming a fine american 

1961
01:27:10,580 --> 01:27:12,030
institution.
Jesus christ.

1962
01:27:12,150 --> 01:27:13,590
I said a legend.
How dare you?

1963
01:27:14,660 --> 01:27:16,790
No,
but I know you're in that area.

1964
01:27:16,800 --> 01:27:21,800
The whole area is bomb tie.
I loved that place that cuban joined 

1965
01:27:21,800 --> 01:27:26,461
them.
We go to the fucking says that chicken 

1966
01:27:26,461 --> 01:27:29,171
with garlic,
the garlic chicken with amazing things 

1967
01:27:29,171 --> 01:27:29,171
that you like.
Onions,

1968
01:27:29,900 --> 01:27:32,810
cuban style.
That chicken is so god damn good.

1969
01:27:32,811 --> 01:27:35,030
It's the best chicken in the world.
I love that chicken.

1970
01:27:35,330 --> 01:27:37,760
That domingo's is next to a buck law 
factory.

1971
01:27:37,820 --> 01:27:42,820
Okay.
I know exactly what it is and they 

1972
01:27:42,820 --> 01:27:42,820
fucking make.
I mean,

1973
01:27:42,820 --> 01:27:43,970
I've been hearing it from steve,
so mom,

1974
01:27:44,000 --> 01:27:46,680
the aiga stino they bring,
you know,

1975
01:27:46,700 --> 01:27:50,060
brought me a half a meatball sandwich 
and I was like,

1976
01:27:50,061 --> 01:27:52,310
yeah,
there's an episode of anthony bourdain's

1977
01:27:52,311 --> 01:27:57,311
show where he goes to this spot in New 
York city that's been around since the 

1978
01:27:57,311 --> 01:28:01,340
18 hundreds with the same family and 
they bring him over spaghetti with gravy

1979
01:28:01,341 --> 01:28:03,570
and meatballs and so they call it great.
Yeah.

1980
01:28:03,720 --> 01:28:08,720
They call it gravy back then.
It's like old style east coast italian 

1981
01:28:08,720 --> 01:28:12,581
and you look at the spaghetti's yellow 
and the sauces ready let ball and you're

1982
01:28:13,011 --> 01:28:14,720
like,
oh my god,

1983
01:28:14,721 --> 01:28:16,820
it's red led.
That's what kills you,

1984
01:28:17,400 --> 01:28:19,760
but you've got to eat that at five and 
go for a walk.

1985
01:28:19,830 --> 01:28:20,680
Read,
lead,

1986
01:28:21,780 --> 01:28:24,000
track realizes.
You know,

1987
01:28:24,010 --> 01:28:25,650
what do they put down?
What do real good?

1988
01:28:25,690 --> 01:28:27,940
He's put in that sauce.
Let's get down to it.

1989
01:28:31,720 --> 01:28:32,940
Nothing else?
No.

1990
01:28:33,280 --> 01:28:35,930
Now italians now for the last 10 years 
now,

1991
01:28:35,931 --> 01:28:38,750
real italians because of their heart.
They Turkey,

1992
01:28:39,490 --> 01:28:41,880
Turkey.
That motherfucker faced the same goal.

1993
01:28:42,810 --> 01:28:44,690
You're already written off dog.
It tastes the same.

1994
01:28:44,930 --> 01:28:47,150
That shIt started 10 years ago.
Yeah.

1995
01:28:47,151 --> 01:28:52,151
When you think about what red led is,
they put the beef the fucking sunday 

1996
01:28:52,151 --> 01:28:52,151
sauce.
Yeah.

1997
01:28:52,151 --> 01:28:53,120
There's nothing healthy in there.
Yeah.

1998
01:28:53,121 --> 01:28:58,121
They always had a sunday sauce and the 
sunday sauce would be just all kinds of 

1999
01:28:58,121 --> 01:28:58,630
shit.
Sausage meat.

2000
01:28:58,631 --> 01:29:00,200
Why didn't you go to sleep after you eat
it?

2001
01:29:00,680 --> 01:29:03,330
How many grams do you.
Your body assimilates what?

2002
01:29:03,331 --> 01:29:05,280
Thirty grams.
Dirty.

2003
01:29:05,281 --> 01:29:07,020
You need 1:50
a day to build muscle.

2004
01:29:07,290 --> 01:29:12,290
That shit is 99.
Your body crashes like your body 

2005
01:29:12,290 --> 01:29:16,251
crashes.
The fat from the poor and the fork and 

2006
01:29:16,251 --> 01:29:17,780
the fucking brand flavor.
The flavor to flavor the good.

2007
01:29:18,420 --> 01:29:19,950
Oh my god.
You've got to have the pork.

2008
01:29:20,010 --> 01:29:23,020
The flavor don't put too much,
too Much onion,

2009
01:29:23,580 --> 01:29:28,580
onion,
so that fucking scene makes me hungry 

2010
01:29:28,580 --> 01:29:31,740
every Time.
Paulie's slicing the uh,

2011
01:29:31,800 --> 01:29:32,190
the,
the,

2012
01:29:32,191 --> 01:29:34,140
the,
the garlic with the razor blade.

2013
01:29:34,150 --> 01:29:38,540
A medicare in jail.
Funny guy.

2014
01:29:38,550 --> 01:29:40,110
Where they got where they got for.
so you got some bread,

2015
01:29:40,111 --> 01:29:42,080
throw it on there.
I got some wine.

2016
01:29:42,700 --> 01:29:44,380
That's a rule.

2017
01:29:47,050 --> 01:29:52,050
If that was really.
I wonder if that was really how they 

2018
01:29:52,050 --> 01:29:52,050
live in jail.
It really,

2019
01:29:52,050 --> 01:29:53,320
really did.
You could get a.

2020
01:29:54,510 --> 01:29:57,230
I'm trying to do a special,
so I'm trying to figure out what they're

2021
01:29:57,240 --> 01:29:58,830
doing doing this between houston and 
denver,

2022
01:29:59,280 --> 01:30:04,280
but if I do it in denver,
I'm going to go close to where I did 

2023
01:30:04,280 --> 01:30:04,280
time.
I camp George West.

2024
01:30:04,440 --> 01:30:06,960
It's a little camp right by golden 
Colorado.

2025
01:30:06,961 --> 01:30:08,370
The house of course.
Dude,

2026
01:30:08,371 --> 01:30:10,410
I think I want to do my next special in 
denver.

2027
01:30:10,770 --> 01:30:15,770
I think it's,
that's the place that I think I'm going 

2028
01:30:15,770 --> 01:30:15,770
to do my next special at a comedy club.
Really?

2029
01:30:15,770 --> 01:30:20,180
Yeah.
I think I'm going to do my next one at 

2030
01:30:20,180 --> 01:30:20,180
the comedy works and then ran a bad 
idea.

2031
01:30:20,180 --> 01:30:21,060
Yeah.
I haven't talked to wendy about it.

2032
01:30:21,090 --> 01:30:21,850
Take it back.
Oh,

2033
01:30:21,920 --> 01:30:25,020
it's one of my favorIte places to eat.
I like those small things too.

2034
01:30:25,020 --> 01:30:27,430
That's the problem.
I want to calm me cup,

2035
01:30:27,460 --> 01:30:32,460
but I heard that some comedy because 
you've got to give him 20 grand when 

2036
01:30:32,460 --> 01:30:35,511
you're saying you know when you're 
saying you would do it near where you 

2037
01:30:35,511 --> 01:30:35,700
got arrested.
Like where was that?

2038
01:30:36,300 --> 01:30:39,420
I got arrested in boulder so I could do 
the fox theater boulders.

2039
01:30:39,450 --> 01:30:44,450
Great.
I can do a bunch of stuff to boulder 

2040
01:30:44,450 --> 01:30:44,850
while school's in session.
Are you fucking kidding me?

2041
01:30:45,090 --> 01:30:50,090
We could go there anytime we want.
You tell me you want to book a show in 

2042
01:30:50,090 --> 01:30:53,331
boulder.
I'll book a show with you tomorrow on 

2043
01:30:53,331 --> 01:30:53,331
boulder.
Man,

2044
01:30:53,331 --> 01:30:55,701
I love it.
I've been trying to kidnap my wife and 

2045
01:30:55,701 --> 01:30:57,591
bring her back there for forever.
Boulder is the shit that's the greatest 

2046
01:30:57,591 --> 01:31:02,571
town on earth.
I mean it's right up there with Alaska 

2047
01:31:02,571 --> 01:31:03,510
that anchorage Alaska,
but Alaska gets too cold.

2048
01:31:03,760 --> 01:31:05,100
Boulder gets tower.

2049
01:31:05,100 --> 01:31:07,050
How good was deficient then?
It's incredible.

2050
01:31:07,290 --> 01:31:09,280
Did you get with digital you?
No.

2051
01:31:09,390 --> 01:31:09,940
Yeah.
No.

2052
01:31:10,030 --> 01:31:13,820
I think we had some what would have had 
some crab legs out.

2053
01:31:13,821 --> 01:31:14,530
Good with it.
Oh,

2054
01:31:15,450 --> 01:31:18,730
you get into fresh,
getting fresh alaskan king crab legs,

2055
01:31:18,930 --> 01:31:20,520
gelson's with.
Oh shIt.

2056
01:31:20,610 --> 01:31:22,890
Eighty $2.
And then it gets here two days later.

2057
01:31:23,310 --> 01:31:26,010
What's really bad ass about Alaska is 
the people though.

2058
01:31:26,250 --> 01:31:31,250
The people are just top notch man.
They were so fucking cool that couldn't 

2059
01:31:31,561 --> 01:31:36,561
have been cooler.
It was just like one of those plaCes 

2060
01:31:36,561 --> 01:31:36,561
you're like,
oh,

2061
01:31:36,561 --> 01:31:37,350
I get it when you're just there for a 
day,

2062
01:31:37,620 --> 01:31:39,120
you need to just like,
oh man,

2063
01:31:39,121 --> 01:31:41,670
people are there.
They are different up here.

2064
01:31:41,820 --> 01:31:46,820
There are different BeCause they got to 
deal with an extreme climate and they 

2065
01:31:46,820 --> 01:31:46,820
all bond together.
You know,

2066
01:31:47,370 --> 01:31:52,370
like they were talking.
one of the dudes that was working there 

2067
01:31:52,370 --> 01:31:53,871
was talking about jewel because jewel is
from Alaska and apparently something 

2068
01:31:54,181 --> 01:31:58,000
happened once where she had to cancel a 
show and uh,

2069
01:31:58,140 --> 01:32:00,010
then when she came back after she had

2070
01:32:00,010 --> 01:32:05,010
canceled,
it was like really low attendance 

2071
01:32:05,010 --> 01:32:05,650
because people were disappointed or they
don't forgive you for stuff like that.

2072
01:32:05,651 --> 01:32:07,480
Like they think like you,
you like you,

2073
01:32:07,481 --> 01:32:10,930
you're a part of a community and if you 
cancel something,

2074
01:32:10,931 --> 01:32:12,850
especially if you don't have like the 
best excuse ever,

2075
01:32:12,851 --> 01:32:16,360
they get upset at you.
I don't know.

2076
01:32:17,260 --> 01:32:19,810
They said she's normal.
That such as like a normal person.

2077
01:32:19,840 --> 01:32:21,070
She's out there just,
you know,

2078
01:32:21,520 --> 01:32:23,920
everybody knows where houses no one.
Nobody fucks with her.

2079
01:32:24,550 --> 01:32:29,550
Just normal.
Have you watched the liberace movie on 

2080
01:32:29,550 --> 01:32:29,680
hbo?
I heard you were doing a bit about it on

2081
01:32:29,690 --> 01:32:31,720
stage.
I didn't hear it.

2082
01:32:31,721 --> 01:32:33,220
I love that.
I love really.

2083
01:32:33,750 --> 01:32:35,590
It's so some people.
It's to.

2084
01:32:35,900 --> 01:32:38,080
For me,
it's to see what I've seen growing up.

2085
01:32:38,500 --> 01:32:42,190
Creepy old fags trying to pick up young 
fucking guys and doing it.

2086
01:32:42,520 --> 01:32:45,750
and how he did it.
Show how he did it,

2087
01:32:45,760 --> 01:32:46,600
how he did it.

2088
01:32:46,870 --> 01:32:49,990
He had a lawyer.
He had his manager that would just write

2089
01:32:49,991 --> 01:32:51,940
the checks.
You got to give them the jewelry back.

2090
01:32:52,480 --> 01:32:54,370
It was brilliant.
That's funny.

2091
01:32:54,400 --> 01:32:55,210
I'll tell you what he did.
He,

2092
01:32:55,290 --> 01:32:58,450
matt damon's character.
He made them get plastic surgery to look

2093
01:32:58,451 --> 01:33:00,490
like him.
WaTch the fucking.

2094
01:33:00,530 --> 01:33:03,010
That's hilarious.
watch the fucking movie.

2095
01:33:03,310 --> 01:33:06,220
You're gonna die.
You're gonna die when he gets matt damon

2096
01:33:06,221 --> 01:33:07,810
in side control with his dick in his 
mouth.

2097
01:33:08,000 --> 01:33:12,070
Oh my.
Who's up swallows that fucking sword.

2098
01:33:12,460 --> 01:33:13,770
Listen to me.
Watch the moon.

2099
01:33:13,771 --> 01:33:16,690
Wasn't really that good because watched 
the movie though.

2100
01:33:16,780 --> 01:33:21,100
That sounds like brokeback nights.
It's not like brokeback mountain,

2101
01:33:21,101 --> 01:33:23,140
but it's interesting to see,
you know.

2102
01:33:23,260 --> 01:33:28,260
Listen man,
we've heard some fucked up shit living 

2103
01:33:28,260 --> 01:33:28,260
in hollywood.
We've got a lot of stories.

2104
01:33:28,260 --> 01:33:32,041
Yes.
But you never heard of a motherfucker 

2105
01:33:32,041 --> 01:33:34,530
making another motherfucker do plastic 
surgery to look like look like him and 

2106
01:33:34,530 --> 01:33:35,350
then threw his ass out and gave him 75 
grand.

2107
01:33:35,920 --> 01:33:38,920
Wow.
So I found ouT the olive garden thing,

2108
01:33:38,980 --> 01:33:40,750
I guess it used to be fresher back in 
the day.

2109
01:33:40,751 --> 01:33:43,810
They used to make noodles out in the 
open so everyone could see it and stuff.

2110
01:33:43,811 --> 01:33:46,030
But to cut cost they've kind of cut 
things.

2111
01:33:46,880 --> 01:33:47,560
But.
But it's,

2112
01:33:47,590 --> 01:33:52,590
it's a lot of people were saying like,
I always say the sauces are always 

2113
01:33:52,590 --> 01:33:52,590
frozen.
Supposedly half the shit's frozen.

2114
01:33:52,590 --> 01:33:54,940
Half of it's not just like every other 
restaurant.

2115
01:33:54,941 --> 01:33:57,720
You don't get chicken rice.
Well listen,

2116
01:33:57,730 --> 01:34:00,490
if you want low prices,
you've got to deal with that shit.

2117
01:34:01,120 --> 01:34:06,120
So this liberace Movie,
it's called behind the candelabra and 

2118
01:34:06,131 --> 01:34:11,131
when did it come out?
It came out two months ago and I didn't 

2119
01:34:11,131 --> 01:34:13,501
watch it.
I didn't know what it was and I got 

2120
01:34:13,501 --> 01:34:13,501
stuck watching him one nighT and I'm 
like,

2121
01:34:13,501 --> 01:34:13,510
what the fuck?
This is amazing.

2122
01:34:13,900 --> 01:34:18,900
He was a veterinarian.
Now this guy and how he got rid of the 

2123
01:34:18,900 --> 01:34:20,410
veterinarian,
he got rid of the guy before him.

2124
01:34:20,850 --> 01:34:24,230
Like he just got rid of him and then he 
had a bunch of guys and all.

2125
01:34:24,290 --> 01:34:27,010
He would just latch onto young guys and 
touch their leg.

2126
01:34:27,360 --> 01:34:30,580
It was just really a.
You got to just see the fuck.

2127
01:34:30,581 --> 01:34:32,560
Well that's the thing with baltaR gay 
dudes,

2128
01:34:34,710 --> 01:34:37,330
twinks.
These guys were real old school fags,

2129
01:34:37,331 --> 01:34:39,310
bro.
He had a wig.

2130
01:34:39,311 --> 01:34:44,311
you suck.
That meant he was sucking without his 

2131
01:34:44,311 --> 01:34:46,530
wig on the wig off.
I met damon who's this?

2132
01:34:46,531 --> 01:34:47,680
And it goes,
oh,

2133
01:34:47,860 --> 01:34:49,750
it's the first time you saw me without a
wig.

2134
01:34:50,350 --> 01:34:52,830
And it's fucking Michael Douglas.
Oh my god.

2135
01:34:52,920 --> 01:34:54,640
You Just 20,
30 minutes.

2136
01:34:55,760 --> 01:35:00,760
I'm watching that tonight.
That's my favorite new movie and I 

2137
01:35:00,760 --> 01:35:00,760
haven't even seen it.

2138
01:35:02,520 --> 01:35:07,520
That might be my favorite movie and I 
haven't even seen know when I first got 

2139
01:35:07,520 --> 01:35:07,520
here,
nine slash eight.

2140
01:35:07,520 --> 01:35:09,770
The big thing was that book.
You'll never work in this town again.

2141
01:35:10,160 --> 01:35:15,160
Remember that hooker wrote a book and 
she had don henley and the book and 

2142
01:35:15,160 --> 01:35:16,400
charlie sheen,
don henley would get five hookers.

2143
01:35:17,090 --> 01:35:22,090
Tell him to bend over.
They weren't even allowed to pop the 

2144
01:35:22,090 --> 01:35:22,370
head open.
They will all in downward dog for hours.

2145
01:35:22,940 --> 01:35:25,610
Nobody in that group of hookers had 
carpal tunnel syndrome.

2146
01:35:25,611 --> 01:35:27,770
Do you understand me?
He would make five hookers.

2147
01:35:27,771 --> 01:35:32,771
Come over,
put them in that way and I'm not trying 

2148
01:35:32,771 --> 01:35:32,771
to be cute.
He'd do coke and walk around with a rope

2149
01:35:32,771 --> 01:35:34,820
and put his dick in them twice.
Take it up,

2150
01:35:35,370 --> 01:35:40,370
walk over to the hookup,
pump it twice and look at them and go 

2151
01:35:40,370 --> 01:35:40,370
put on hotel California.
Sit down,

2152
01:35:41,620 --> 01:35:46,620
do two more lines of code for viagara 
tip.

2153
01:35:47,630 --> 01:35:50,490
This is before viagra and this is,
but now it was,

2154
01:35:50,630 --> 01:35:52,550
but he asked him.
He asked him liberace.

2155
01:35:52,940 --> 01:35:53,930
He's like,
how do you do it?

2156
01:35:54,290 --> 01:35:56,720
How do you.
How do you fucking do it?

2157
01:35:56,721 --> 01:35:57,440
How do you,
uh,

2158
01:35:58,000 --> 01:36:01,550
how did you fuck me four times today.
And so there's shit in there too.

2159
01:36:01,700 --> 01:36:06,700
You can see liberace does the poppers 
and matt damon wants to sniff the 

2160
01:36:06,700 --> 01:36:06,700
poppers.
So.

2161
01:36:06,700 --> 01:36:07,940
Wow,
this sounds like the best one we ever.

2162
01:36:08,110 --> 01:36:10,640
Now,
how does poppers make you get your dick?

2163
01:36:10,641 --> 01:36:11,310
Hard as hell,
bro.

2164
01:36:11,311 --> 01:36:13,400
I don't know.
The poppers was like a relaxed mother,

2165
01:36:13,410 --> 01:36:15,290
papa type of guy.
But in the gay community,

2166
01:36:15,650 --> 01:36:17,330
I guess when you're fucking another guy 
in the muffler,

2167
01:36:17,331 --> 01:36:19,710
you hit them with a papa and it keeps 
his dick hard.

2168
01:36:19,711 --> 01:36:22,600
I don't know.
I don't quote me on top.

2169
01:36:22,800 --> 01:36:25,370
I was never into pop.
What do they call it?

2170
01:36:25,520 --> 01:36:27,740
What's a little fucking thing?
Nitrates.

2171
01:36:27,800 --> 01:36:30,470
But one of the.
What's the brand locker room?

2172
01:36:31,220 --> 01:36:33,210
Whether it's the brand,
the brand.

2173
01:36:33,211 --> 01:36:34,130
The popper.
Yeah.

2174
01:36:34,131 --> 01:36:35,010
No,
I've never taken it.

2175
01:36:35,020 --> 01:36:36,710
I didn't know what a proper guy.
One of his.

2176
01:36:36,760 --> 01:36:40,790
But he's got him in his fucking house.
That's his middle name of columbus.

2177
01:36:41,680 --> 01:36:46,680
Fuck.
This motherfucker was making sixth 

2178
01:36:46,680 --> 01:36:48,770
graders sniff that shit.
Its proper speed.

2179
01:36:49,010 --> 01:36:50,390
No,
it's this joint.

2180
01:36:50,391 --> 01:36:52,310
It's this drink.
And what happened was,

2181
01:36:52,311 --> 01:36:57,311
what time of the miami improv had a,
had a condo across the street from it,

2182
01:36:57,321 --> 01:36:59,660
the old miami and probably belong to one
of the owners.

2183
01:36:59,661 --> 01:37:01,580
It was where he put his mistresses issue
this bit.

2184
01:37:02,300 --> 01:37:05,840
But I think he bought the club,
the club and I had the bed in the wall.

2185
01:37:05,870 --> 01:37:09,170
I must've fucked 80 women that I used to
tie him up there.

2186
01:37:09,171 --> 01:37:14,171
I would tie them up and put coke rocks 
in their pussy and shit and they will 

2187
01:37:14,171 --> 01:37:16,130
all wake up tied up like jesus and you 
get that bed,

2188
01:37:16,131 --> 01:37:17,410
you can still see like eight rope.

2189
01:37:18,790 --> 01:37:20,590
I always had to get new rope to tie him 
up.

2190
01:37:20,840 --> 01:37:23,810
But one time I wasn't there and they 
called me like,

2191
01:37:23,811 --> 01:37:25,120
where are you?
I'm like,

2192
01:37:25,130 --> 01:37:26,480
I'm in la.
What's going on?

2193
01:37:26,481 --> 01:37:28,070
They're like,
well you have to condo two weeks ago.

2194
01:37:28,071 --> 01:37:28,610
And I'm like,
no.

2195
01:37:28,611 --> 01:37:30,260
And they're like,
because weber was there,

2196
01:37:30,440 --> 01:37:32,510
left a mess and they left a thousand 
poppers.

2197
01:37:34,130 --> 01:37:35,960
The type of mother I snort,
coke dog.

2198
01:37:36,380 --> 01:37:38,390
Don't confuse me with doing fucking 
poppers.

2199
01:37:38,870 --> 01:37:41,810
And it was a little thing like this and 
you opened it and had locker in it.

2200
01:37:42,280 --> 01:37:44,450
It's,
it was a locker room or something.

2201
01:37:44,660 --> 01:37:46,070
That's what it was called,
which sniff it.

2202
01:37:46,280 --> 01:37:48,560
And they get you high,
like 60 seconds.

2203
01:37:48,561 --> 01:37:53,561
Get the fuck that shit supposed to give 
you an instant brain average to give you

2204
01:37:54,280 --> 01:37:54,950
age.
I think.

2205
01:37:55,260 --> 01:37:56,070
No,
that was

2206
01:37:56,070 --> 01:37:59,700
what duesberg was claiming that that was
a part of,

2207
01:37:59,740 --> 01:38:00,420
uh,
you know,

2208
01:38:00,600 --> 01:38:05,600
I shouldn't even that,
that was the most controversial podcast 

2209
01:38:05,600 --> 01:38:06,870
we ever do.
The age podcast that we had.

2210
01:38:06,871 --> 01:38:10,010
This guy peter duesberg and duesberg is 
a,

2211
01:38:10,410 --> 01:38:13,720
he's a professor at the university of 
California berkeley.

2212
01:38:13,721 --> 01:38:17,130
He's a biologist and he was the one that
said that hiv doesn't cause aids.

2213
01:38:17,250 --> 01:38:20,190
So we had this guy on and tried to have 
them explain to us.

2214
01:38:20,460 --> 01:38:22,220
Of course we're idiots.
So we didn't,

2215
01:38:22,250 --> 01:38:24,480
we don't know if what he's saying is 
right or wrong.

2216
01:38:24,510 --> 01:38:26,640
He might be completely full of shit.
He might be making shit up.

2217
01:38:26,641 --> 01:38:27,090
We,
we,

2218
01:38:27,220 --> 01:38:28,620
you know,
brian and I have no idea.

2219
01:38:28,860 --> 01:38:29,720
And so I said,
well,

2220
01:38:29,730 --> 01:38:33,210
let me get matt stags to see if he can 
get someone to debate them.

2221
01:38:33,510 --> 01:38:38,510
Nobody would debate the dude.
Everybody was telling me I was an 

2222
01:38:38,510 --> 01:38:38,510
asshole for having them on because,
okay,

2223
01:38:38,510 --> 01:38:40,470
I don't know,
but are you sure that he's not right?

2224
01:38:40,590 --> 01:38:42,840
He's got damn biologist at the 
university of California,

2225
01:38:42,841 --> 01:38:47,841
berkeley published biologist who has 
read all this like peer reviewed 

2226
01:38:47,841 --> 01:38:48,510
research on cancer that everybody 
respects.

2227
01:38:49,020 --> 01:38:52,200
And he's saying crazy shit like hiv 
doesn't cause aids.

2228
01:38:52,230 --> 01:38:54,300
The problem is I'm an idiot.
Okay.

2229
01:38:54,301 --> 01:38:56,550
So when I go online and I try to read 
the arguments,

2230
01:38:56,551 --> 01:39:01,551
like whether or not it does or doesn't,
it seems to me that if more people are 

2231
01:39:01,551 --> 01:39:04,881
saying it does,
then I would go with them because 

2232
01:39:04,881 --> 01:39:04,881
they're scientists,
right?

2233
01:39:04,881 --> 01:39:07,730
There's a few of these row guys like him
that say it's just they're taking aim on

2234
01:39:07,740 --> 01:39:12,740
nitrate and they taking crystal meth and
they're just crushing their immune 

2235
01:39:12,740 --> 01:39:15,831
system and that's why these guys were 
all getting sick and that it's not hiv 

2236
01:39:15,831 --> 01:39:15,831
killing them.
It's partying,

2237
01:39:15,831 --> 01:39:17,730
it's killed.
But then people say,

2238
01:39:17,760 --> 01:39:20,310
oh,
you're a homophobe for saying this.

2239
01:39:20,311 --> 01:39:25,311
And it's a terrible thing he's doing and
it's an justin's and blood is on his 

2240
01:39:25,311 --> 01:39:29,571
hands and people are still dying of aids
and hiv because they don't take care of 

2241
01:39:29,571 --> 01:39:29,571
themselves.

2242
01:39:29,571 --> 01:39:30,730
Exactly.
Exactly.

2243
01:39:30,930 --> 01:39:32,990
Copper bottle looks like this is so 
ironic.

2244
01:39:33,570 --> 01:39:35,720
If anybody hears this and you know,
I'm sorry.

2245
01:39:35,780 --> 01:39:37,380
Well that's legal.
I rent the horse.

2246
01:39:37,381 --> 01:39:42,381
Yeah,
you can just buy them in the stores for 

2247
01:39:42,381 --> 01:39:42,381
what?
What's the use for?

2248
01:39:42,381 --> 01:39:43,530
What are you supposed to use it for?
Oh my god.

2249
01:39:43,531 --> 01:39:45,990
Wholesale gay poppers.
That's legal.

2250
01:39:46,800 --> 01:39:48,900
Hold on son.
And go back.

2251
01:39:48,990 --> 01:39:51,870
Listen,
I'm dropping knowledge on homes today.

2252
01:39:51,900 --> 01:39:54,300
Don't promote these because these are 
probably killing people.

2253
01:39:54,810 --> 01:39:59,810
But uh,
if anybody knows anybody that's a 

2254
01:39:59,810 --> 01:39:59,810
biologist who wants a date,
a date,

2255
01:40:01,280 --> 01:40:04,680
peter duesberg,
show them some aids.

2256
01:40:05,480 --> 01:40:07,740
No debate.
My apologies.

2257
01:40:07,741 --> 01:40:09,870
Mr duisburg sir.
It was just a joke.

2258
01:40:09,871 --> 01:40:11,570
I'm a comedian.
If there was any other show,

2259
01:40:11,571 --> 01:40:16,571
I probably,
you probably really be mad at me right 

2260
01:40:16,571 --> 01:40:16,571
now.
But those jokes happen often.

2261
01:40:16,571 --> 01:40:17,970
Um,
I wanted someone to debate them,

2262
01:40:18,030 --> 01:40:21,120
but nobody wanted to have any pieces to 
intelligent or because.

2263
01:40:21,150 --> 01:40:23,520
No,
I think it's like a holocaust denier.

2264
01:40:23,820 --> 01:40:28,820
Like if you debate a holocaust denier,
you actually giving them some form of 

2265
01:40:28,820 --> 01:40:29,520
credit.
You're like,

2266
01:40:29,521 --> 01:40:34,521
by even debating them,
especially if they're like a legit 

2267
01:40:34,521 --> 01:40:34,521
historian sits down with a holocaust 
denier,

2268
01:40:34,521 --> 01:40:39,321
like it's such a preposterous idea that 
even to be connected with it is somehow 

2269
01:40:39,321 --> 01:40:43,641
another pro promoting it.
And so it's so distasteful that nobody 

2270
01:40:43,641 --> 01:40:44,690
wants to talk to a holocaust denier.
It's uh,

2271
01:40:44,700 --> 01:40:45,270
you know,
it's,

2272
01:40:45,271 --> 01:40:47,880
you don't even give them the time of day
holocaust denier.

2273
01:40:48,000 --> 01:40:50,520
Yes.
A deny or someone who says the holocaust

2274
01:40:50,521 --> 01:40:55,521
didn't happen.
There's a lot of people like that out 

2275
01:40:55,521 --> 01:40:55,521
there.
By the way.

2276
01:40:55,521 --> 01:40:55,521
There's

2277
01:40:55,521 --> 01:40:57,300
a lot of crazy fucks that think that the
concentration camps,

2278
01:40:57,310 --> 01:41:00,010
and then I'm going to get some tweets.
Now what would you need to know?

2279
01:41:00,080 --> 01:41:05,080
Is it the exaggerated numbers?
And what I need to know is why are you 

2280
01:41:05,080 --> 01:41:09,631
concentrating on that?
Why are you even trying to doubt that 

2281
01:41:09,631 --> 01:41:10,100
aspect of history?
I mean,

2282
01:41:10,170 --> 01:41:15,170
have you ever watched those videos where
you see those poor fucking people being 

2283
01:41:15,170 --> 01:41:18,241
led to the concentration camps is no 
doubt horrific shit went on.

2284
01:41:19,030 --> 01:41:21,230
You know,
you trying to reduce the numbers.

2285
01:41:21,340 --> 01:41:23,860
It's actually 4 million,
not shit.

2286
01:41:25,400 --> 01:41:27,970
It's horrible time in history,
disgusting.

2287
01:41:28,110 --> 01:41:33,110
And you know,
what's really fucked up about the 

2288
01:41:33,110 --> 01:41:33,110
holocaust.
It was so recent.

2289
01:41:33,110 --> 01:41:34,780
You know,
when I was a little kid,

2290
01:41:35,170 --> 01:41:40,170
I remember I was,
I was born in 1967 and when I was a 

2291
01:41:40,170 --> 01:41:40,400
little kid,
uh,

2292
01:41:40,401 --> 01:41:45,401
I remember that we were like talking 
about world war ii and uh,

2293
01:41:47,440 --> 01:41:52,440
we were talking about world war ii and 
the holocaust and it seems so long ago 

2294
01:41:52,440 --> 01:41:52,840
because it was,
you know,

2295
01:41:53,110 --> 01:41:55,270
at the time,
maybe like 30 years ago,

2296
01:41:55,271 --> 01:42:00,271
I was like 1977 or something like that 
when I was 10 and it seems like a 

2297
01:42:00,271 --> 01:42:04,560
million years ago,
but now when I think back of 30 years 

2298
01:42:04,560 --> 01:42:07,801
ago,
like 1977 is like basically 30 years 

2299
01:42:07,801 --> 01:42:07,801
ago.

2300
01:42:07,801 --> 01:42:10,330
That shit is so recent.
It's so goddamn recent.

2301
01:42:10,360 --> 01:42:12,490
Like I can remember 19,
77.

2302
01:42:12,491 --> 01:42:17,491
I don't remember a lot of things.
I remember my mother had a gold 

2303
01:42:17,491 --> 01:42:17,491
barracuda,
you know,

2304
01:42:17,491 --> 01:42:17,491
um,
I remember,

2305
01:42:17,491 --> 01:42:18,760
uh,
we,

2306
01:42:18,761 --> 01:42:19,900
uh,
lived in san francisco.

2307
01:42:19,901 --> 01:42:23,860
I remember I remember some shit from,
from 1977.

2308
01:42:25,600 --> 01:42:30,050
So that freaks me out that that recently
people could have done that,

2309
01:42:30,520 --> 01:42:35,520
that,
that recently people could have just 

2310
01:42:35,520 --> 01:42:35,520
decided that all jews are evil and we're
going to kill them all.

2311
01:42:35,530 --> 01:42:37,420
You know?
How many people did stalin kill?

2312
01:42:37,450 --> 01:42:38,500
You know,
how many people?

2313
01:42:39,850 --> 01:42:43,570
How many people did hitler kill?
Just 47.

2314
01:42:43,820 --> 01:42:45,870
Crazy.
You ever seen hitler's artwork?

2315
01:42:46,530 --> 01:42:48,310
No.
It's amazing.

2316
01:42:48,750 --> 01:42:53,750
He was really talented artists.
Like he could have totally just been a 

2317
01:42:53,750 --> 01:42:53,750
famous artist.
First of all,

2318
01:42:53,750 --> 01:42:58,501
how dare you?
You're never supposed to give credit a 

2319
01:42:58,501 --> 01:43:00,520
credit at all to hitler.
Like someone in the ufc q and a said,

2320
01:43:00,521 --> 01:43:02,170
if you could fight anyone in history,
who would it be?

2321
01:43:02,170 --> 01:43:04,180
I said hitler.
So fuck hitler up.

2322
01:43:04,181 --> 01:43:06,340
I'd kick the shit out of hitler.
That's a.

2323
01:43:06,370 --> 01:43:08,790
I'll bet the house that I'm going to 
win.

2324
01:43:10,270 --> 01:43:10,900
Come on,
man.

2325
01:43:10,960 --> 01:43:13,480
They don't even have vitamins back then.
We'll fuck that dude.

2326
01:43:13,481 --> 01:43:14,650
I was stupid.
Mustache.

2327
01:43:14,700 --> 01:43:16,300
I can look at that.
It's pretty sweet though.

2328
01:43:16,301 --> 01:43:19,360
I mean he was a pretty good artist.
That is kind of amazing.

2329
01:43:20,200 --> 01:43:21,520
So there was a good artist.
Yeah.

2330
01:43:21,820 --> 01:43:22,350
Well,
you know,

2331
01:43:22,351 --> 01:43:27,351
what else was kevorkian?
We've shown those on a podcast for 

2332
01:43:27,351 --> 01:43:31,450
member kevorkian was creaky artists guy 
yet I do not know.

2333
01:43:32,200 --> 01:43:34,800
I think he did for years.
You had to buy them every other week.

2334
01:43:34,801 --> 01:43:37,300
Now they put them in jail when he was an
old man,

2335
01:43:37,630 --> 01:43:40,090
you know,
the whole thing is kind of crazy.

2336
01:43:40,920 --> 01:43:41,750
She be able to,
you know,

2337
01:43:41,800 --> 01:43:43,360
should be able to die when you went to 
don man.

2338
01:43:44,110 --> 01:43:45,790
Especially if you're in fucking serious 
pain.

2339
01:43:46,240 --> 01:43:47,770
Like why?
Why shouldn't you be able to die?

2340
01:43:48,190 --> 01:43:48,930
There's a new,
uh,

2341
01:43:49,060 --> 01:43:51,920
hitler's chicken.
Have you heard of hitler's chick?

2342
01:43:51,921 --> 01:43:52,210
Yeah,

2343
01:43:52,210 --> 01:43:57,210
it's in Thailand.
That just opened up and they're kfc is 

2344
01:43:57,210 --> 01:43:58,550
gonna assume because it was an old kfc 
and they actually,

2345
01:43:58,720 --> 01:44:02,830
oh my god,
hitler fried chicken in Thailand.

2346
01:44:03,670 --> 01:44:08,670
Oh my god.
It's kfc and they just put hitler space 

2347
01:44:08,670 --> 01:44:08,670
on it.

2348
01:44:11,840 --> 01:44:14,720
So crazy.
Why can't you do that though?

2349
01:44:14,860 --> 01:44:17,780
It has enough time passed.
I bet you could sell gingiss conference.

2350
01:44:18,830 --> 01:44:19,970
I bet if you had gangs.
Cons,

2351
01:44:19,971 --> 01:44:21,500
fries.
I think it's because we were.

2352
01:44:21,720 --> 01:44:26,720
Yeah,
but I think it's because ovens are 

2353
01:44:26,720 --> 01:44:26,720
involved,
you know,

2354
01:44:26,720 --> 01:44:26,720
in,
you know,

2355
01:44:26,720 --> 01:44:26,940
the ovens.
I didn't think of that.

2356
01:44:28,240 --> 01:44:29,920
How do you know they're not frying them?
Oh,

2357
01:44:29,921 --> 01:44:31,060
that's true.
Yeah.

2358
01:44:31,090 --> 01:44:33,250
They usually deep frying techniques.
Who it.

2359
01:44:33,350 --> 01:44:34,540
Who gives a fuck?
It's chicken.

2360
01:44:34,541 --> 01:44:36,790
It's not a fucking hoe human.
It's just.

2361
01:44:37,630 --> 01:44:40,170
That's not long enough ago,
but you could have gangs.

2362
01:44:40,180 --> 01:44:41,940
Conference fries.
You could have a huge.

2363
01:44:42,250 --> 01:44:44,470
How about caesar little caesar?
How about that?

2364
01:44:44,680 --> 01:44:46,630
Seizure was an evil cut there.
We're all evil.

2365
01:44:46,640 --> 01:44:49,360
Cons that are responsible for the death 
of millions now.

2366
01:44:49,361 --> 01:44:52,650
They're a cute little cartoon and it's 
holding up a pizza a little season.

2367
01:44:52,660 --> 01:44:54,520
Do you ever think of that?
Think a little caesar.

2368
01:44:54,700 --> 01:44:57,100
Caesar was a and there's never been a 
caesar.

2369
01:44:57,101 --> 01:44:59,650
Julius caesar had never been a caesar,
didn't have blood on his hands.

2370
01:45:00,070 --> 01:45:05,070
Romans were crazy.
They were fucking savages by the time 

2371
01:45:05,070 --> 01:45:06,520
the fall of the roman empire was going 
on.

2372
01:45:07,180 --> 01:45:11,560
How many of those caesar's didn't have 
like a few deaths on their hands?

2373
01:45:11,620 --> 01:45:13,840
Quite a few.
What's up with that?

2374
01:45:14,160 --> 01:45:15,930
Is that the hitler?
Hitler chicken.

2375
01:45:16,320 --> 01:45:18,820
It's fucking crazy.
Yeah.

2376
01:45:18,910 --> 01:45:23,910
Well,
hitler didn't walk like that to nazi 

2377
01:45:23,910 --> 01:45:23,910
chicken right now.
What does it say?

2378
01:45:23,910 --> 01:45:27,740
Go back to that fucking bottle yet.
What does it say it does to the gay 

2379
01:45:27,740 --> 01:45:27,740
poppers?

2380
01:45:27,740 --> 01:45:32,180
I'm still fascinated and never left.
He's been pretending to care about 

2381
01:45:32,180 --> 01:45:32,360
hitler.
Fuck.

2382
01:45:32,820 --> 01:45:36,010
Fuck that fucking guy.
Like I'm done with coke.

2383
01:45:36,040 --> 01:45:41,040
But poppers and not out of the question.
I talked to my doctor for my heart.

2384
01:45:41,950 --> 01:45:44,260
That's why they sound on the black 
market gate.

2385
01:45:44,560 --> 01:45:49,560
Turns out joe rogan gay dudes have a 10 
percent healthier heart because of 

2386
01:45:49,560 --> 01:45:53,611
poppers.
So tell boasberg you could shove it up 

2387
01:45:53,611 --> 01:45:53,611
your ass.

2388
01:45:53,611 --> 01:45:55,250
Yeah,
the effects are in brief,

2389
01:45:55,251 --> 01:46:00,251
but intense side effects are a sudden 
surge of blood to the heart and the 

2390
01:46:00,251 --> 01:46:00,251
brain.
So like if you,

2391
01:46:00,470 --> 01:46:04,040
if you want it to sound good,
wanted to answer it really important.

2392
01:46:04,710 --> 01:46:09,710
Ashley quick,
will you marry me on the ass?

2393
01:46:14,120 --> 01:46:19,120
Or like,
let's say if you're in a game show,

2394
01:46:20,470 --> 01:46:24,780
all right?
You get the worst advice ever.

2395
01:46:25,230 --> 01:46:28,050
Imagine some poor fools in front of jude
carries.

2396
01:46:28,051 --> 01:46:33,010
Try to guess the price is right.
And you're like brian,

2397
01:46:33,011 --> 01:46:35,780
red beds attached to a pump right now.
It's isn't it?

2398
01:46:35,900 --> 01:46:36,190
Uh,
it,

2399
01:46:36,200 --> 01:46:36,640
it,
uh,

2400
01:46:36,650 --> 01:46:39,470
it's time slowing down.
It feels like it's time slowing down.

2401
01:46:39,471 --> 01:46:40,700
So like,
uh,

2402
01:46:40,760 --> 01:46:44,300
it also is a heat flush,
sometimes light headiness,

2403
01:46:44,301 --> 01:46:47,030
giddiness.
Someone's doing two to five,

2404
01:46:47,060 --> 01:46:50,100
five minutes and a,
someone's

2405
01:46:50,100 --> 01:46:51,270
got to do,
by the way,

2406
01:46:51,330 --> 01:46:56,330
speaking of drugs,
you see the fucking michael jackson's 

2407
01:46:56,330 --> 01:46:56,470
shit was going on with this trial.
No,

2408
01:46:56,520 --> 01:46:58,380
they ain't give him this motherfucking 
money though.

2409
01:46:59,070 --> 01:47:02,490
The worst thing they could have done 
with this trial was really opened up the

2410
01:47:02,491 --> 01:47:05,430
world to what this guy really was.
Did you see yesterday's article?

2411
01:47:05,550 --> 01:47:10,550
No,
I haven't been following it at all 

2412
01:47:10,550 --> 01:47:10,550
because of the tracks on his ass.
Oh no.

2413
01:47:11,430 --> 01:47:15,600
Like the skin was too damaged from just 
shooting himself in the ass.

2414
01:47:15,810 --> 01:47:18,210
So don't like,
oh god,

2415
01:47:18,720 --> 01:47:22,380
this guy was fucking out there and 
somebody,

2416
01:47:22,381 --> 01:47:24,240
a doctor that I go to,
the seek said to me,

2417
01:47:24,241 --> 01:47:29,241
he goes,
these people don't know what can of 

2418
01:47:29,241 --> 01:47:31,510
worms to open up by doing this.
This guy had skeletons in the closet 

2419
01:47:31,510 --> 01:47:35,220
that go back 30 fucking years since off 
the wall.

2420
01:47:35,850 --> 01:47:40,850
Well,
any guy who's like doing that much to 

2421
01:47:40,850 --> 01:47:42,030
his face,
like other craziness that he was doing,

2422
01:47:42,031 --> 01:47:45,660
like that famous picture of him where he
had his nose,

2423
01:47:45,690 --> 01:47:47,340
like have like a.

2424
01:47:47,340 --> 01:47:49,680
There was like a skin graft over his 
nose.

2425
01:47:49,681 --> 01:47:51,240
I think it was in court.
Right?

2426
01:47:51,270 --> 01:47:52,270
You remember that picture,
brian?

2427
01:47:52,300 --> 01:47:53,910
Yeah.
Pull that picture up.

2428
01:47:54,060 --> 01:47:59,060
See if you could find that picture.
There's a picture of michael jackson's 

2429
01:47:59,060 --> 01:48:01,791
nose.
That's the old Michael Jackson that we 

2430
01:48:01,791 --> 01:48:02,790
used him drinking whiskey vodka with two
midgets.

2431
01:48:02,990 --> 01:48:04,380
Oh my god.
Is that real?

2432
01:48:04,920 --> 01:48:05,730
Yeah,
I think so.

2433
01:48:06,000 --> 01:48:11,000
You don't even know if that's real.
That's a goddamn sketch from the mantro 

2434
01:48:11,880 --> 01:48:13,860
drunk hipster Michael Jackson.
No,

2435
01:48:14,010 --> 01:48:16,470
the guy do it.
That was a halloween costume.

2436
01:48:16,830 --> 01:48:19,500
This is the real Michael Jackson to 
doves and a pair of underwear.

2437
01:48:20,490 --> 01:48:25,490
But go,
go see if you can find the photo of his 

2438
01:48:25,490 --> 01:48:26,040
nose because it's one of the weirdest 
things ever.

2439
01:48:26,041 --> 01:48:31,041
And I remember seeing that saying,
this is a strange exercise and culture 

2440
01:48:31,041 --> 01:48:33,180
that we're seeing in Michael Jackson.
Oh god.

2441
01:48:33,350 --> 01:48:36,870
It just pulled it up in a freak because 
for every human being,

2442
01:48:37,790 --> 01:48:38,520
um,
you know,

2443
01:48:38,521 --> 01:48:40,270
these are,
these are strange times.

2444
01:48:40,620 --> 01:48:43,050
That's a skin graft over his nose or 
something.

2445
01:48:43,051 --> 01:48:46,230
Maybe it's tape looks.
It looks like the poster from silence of

2446
01:48:46,231 --> 01:48:48,210
the lambs.
Is that a tape over his nose?

2447
01:48:48,211 --> 01:48:50,400
It's hard to tell what that is.
Is it a bandage?

2448
01:48:50,630 --> 01:48:55,630
It looks just like skin.
It's hard to tell if that skin or some 

2449
01:48:55,630 --> 01:48:56,730
kind of a whole face adhesive or 
something like that.

2450
01:48:56,731 --> 01:49:01,731
But he,
I remember looking at that image and 

2451
01:49:01,731 --> 01:49:03,960
sanken what is this guy done like with 
the skeleton?

2452
01:49:03,961 --> 01:49:08,961
Then I remember thinking,
what must the pressure be like when 

2453
01:49:09,271 --> 01:49:14,271
you're that guy?
What must reality be like if you start 

2454
01:49:14,271 --> 01:49:18,111
off as a child like super famous and 
loved by millions,

2455
01:49:18,600 --> 01:49:23,220
you know,
you remember abc is one,

2456
01:49:23,221 --> 01:49:23,910
two,
three.

2457
01:49:24,600 --> 01:49:27,300
I mean he was huge way,
way,

2458
01:49:27,301 --> 01:49:28,080
way,
way,

2459
01:49:28,081 --> 01:49:33,081
way,
way back before anybody knew how to 

2460
01:49:33,081 --> 01:49:35,751
handle it.
And he was huge as a baby pro and 

2461
01:49:35,751 --> 01:49:40,200
watching justin bieber,
this justin bieber's to make Michael 

2462
01:49:40,200 --> 01:49:43,080
Jackson looks like a fucking puppy.
Dog thinks so he's going to be black and

2463
01:49:43,081 --> 01:49:46,800
like seven years.
He seems fine right now.

2464
01:49:46,801 --> 01:49:47,530
It out.

2465
01:49:48,570 --> 01:49:51,670
It's trying to get some pussy.
Why you hating on them?

2466
01:49:51,720 --> 01:49:55,290
I'm just telling you what I see.
You can't do 90 miles an hour in a.

2467
01:49:55,291 --> 01:49:57,280
In a.
In calabasas around white people.

2468
01:49:57,370 --> 01:50:02,370
I see it with chrome car.
Getting his dick sucked on the 

2469
01:50:02,370 --> 01:50:03,130
[inaudible] too.
I see almost hayden.

2470
01:50:03,180 --> 01:50:04,520
Do you see him oR his car around?

2471
01:50:05,130 --> 01:50:06,730
Nice.
Seeing it on the one on one.

2472
01:50:07,000 --> 01:50:12,000
He apparently as a leopard print car now
on one of those audi are tens or 

2473
01:50:12,000 --> 01:50:12,580
something like that or eights.
Our tens,

2474
01:50:12,581 --> 01:50:17,581
whatever is and it's got leopard print.
I forget buying some beliefs.

2475
01:50:19,360 --> 01:50:20,410
Car to laugh.
I healing.

2476
01:50:20,620 --> 01:50:22,410
You get a razzi.
Oh,

2477
01:50:22,500 --> 01:50:26,230
well someone died on the pacific coast 
highway because they were trying to take

2478
01:50:26,231 --> 01:50:28,390
a picture of a pop rocks.
He was running across the street and get

2479
01:50:28,391 --> 01:50:31,750
clipped.
He died while I'm looking at that.

2480
01:50:31,880 --> 01:50:35,560
Is audi leopard print sexy?
That is so silly.

2481
01:50:36,870 --> 01:50:39,120
It's so silly.
It's so silly that he would do that.

2482
01:50:39,121 --> 01:50:40,780
I wouldn't ugly.
Look to that car.

2483
01:50:41,140 --> 01:50:43,220
That's the most bad ass car,
like a.

2484
01:50:43,280 --> 01:50:48,280
That's everlasting is one of those.
It's such a wicked looking car to cover 

2485
01:50:48,281 --> 01:50:49,800
that thing with.
Looks like leopard print,

2486
01:50:50,470 --> 01:50:52,330
but that's like,
that's the silliest.

2487
01:50:52,750 --> 01:50:54,640
I can do whatever the fuck I want.
Move ever.

2488
01:50:54,840 --> 01:50:57,760
You know he had a karma fisker.
That was chrome.

2489
01:50:58,180 --> 01:51:01,210
Do you ever see that thing?
That's Just preposterous.

2490
01:51:01,540 --> 01:51:03,520
How dare you.
How dare you?

2491
01:51:03,521 --> 01:51:07,780
Young man running around at chrome car.
some nice.

2492
01:51:07,850 --> 01:51:11,110
It'll be on heroin.
Fucking you can fucking.

2493
01:51:11,140 --> 01:51:13,870
People don't want a bunch of shit with 
that kid.

2494
01:51:14,030 --> 01:51:15,310
Maybe met them.
Do some yoga.

2495
01:51:15,311 --> 01:51:15,820
Yeah.
Yeah.

2496
01:51:15,821 --> 01:51:18,790
Metal arc is going.
Gonna seem very friendly.

2497
01:51:18,880 --> 01:51:21,040
Seemed pretty down to earth.
Can consider bitches.

2498
01:51:21,041 --> 01:51:26,041
Fuck is.
just think of how crazy you would be if 

2499
01:51:26,041 --> 01:51:28,441
you were just to where they can away you
would have done if you'd be kim just to 

2500
01:51:28,651 --> 01:51:30,520
beaver when you were 15 or whatever it 
is.

2501
01:51:31,510 --> 01:51:32,620
Fifty dollars,
million dollars.

2502
01:51:34,120 --> 01:51:37,550
You go crazy.
The world is your oyster.

2503
01:51:37,551 --> 01:51:38,430
If somebody comes to you,
says,

2504
01:51:38,440 --> 01:51:40,240
put your money away.
You don't listen to that person.

2505
01:51:40,570 --> 01:51:45,570
You're going to go,
fuck you mad.

2506
01:51:45,840 --> 01:51:49,390
You go to standard and fucking just by 
waitresses like dog,

2507
01:51:49,391 --> 01:51:51,970
how much for you,
you'd be like that prince or the king of

2508
01:51:51,971 --> 01:51:54,060
the game of thrones,
I'll tell you,

2509
01:51:54,070 --> 01:51:56,350
be like be evil,
you know,

2510
01:51:56,351 --> 01:51:59,320
the amount of power,
like that's not the amount of power that

2511
01:51:59,321 --> 01:52:04,321
a person should ever attain and it's 
incredibly rare that a person ever does 

2512
01:52:04,841 --> 01:52:09,841
attain that type of wealth.
like you got justin bieber type wealth 

2513
01:52:09,841 --> 01:52:11,500
and the fact that he's getting and when 
he's 7:00

2514
01:52:11,500 --> 01:52:15,400
AM I boring you philosophy you only in 
the fact that he gets it when he's 17 or

2515
01:52:15,401 --> 01:52:17,890
whatever the hell he is.
How old was he when he got super famous?

2516
01:52:17,910 --> 01:52:22,020
Was like 17 sunlight younger.
What is he now like?

2517
01:52:22,060 --> 01:52:23,560
Nineteen,
something like that.

2518
01:52:23,561 --> 01:52:24,400
He's like a young man now

2519
01:52:24,540 --> 01:52:26,240
we have this game that we played at like
would,

2520
01:52:26,280 --> 01:52:28,530
could you beat up so and so,
so and so.

2521
01:52:28,531 --> 01:52:30,480
And we like say it to like,
you know,

2522
01:52:30,660 --> 01:52:33,960
and I said I can beat a bieber because 
not really thinking.

2523
01:52:34,020 --> 01:52:34,560
I was like,
yeah,

2524
01:52:34,561 --> 01:52:35,880
he's a little kid.
I got old man,

2525
01:52:35,881 --> 01:52:40,881
fat strength.
I could just sit on them or something 

2526
01:52:40,881 --> 01:52:42,561
like that,
but then I saw him with his shirt off 

2527
01:52:42,561 --> 01:52:42,561
the other day on some website and it's 
like,

2528
01:52:42,561 --> 01:52:44,130
holy shit.
That duke would probably desTroy me.

2529
01:52:44,131 --> 01:52:46,070
He's fucking ripped.
He's a little boy

2530
01:52:46,070 --> 01:52:47,090
now.
Fuck you up.

2531
01:52:47,360 --> 01:52:48,800
Plus the thing is like a blue belt or 
something.

2532
01:52:48,860 --> 01:52:51,330
do you think he can beat you up a ds?
Absolutely.

2533
01:52:57,140 --> 01:52:59,030
THat's funny.
It's your blue button digital.

2534
01:52:59,270 --> 01:53:04,270
Somebody told me that he know.
You know who is to michael jackson's 

2535
01:53:04,270 --> 01:53:04,270
son?
He just got his blue belt.

2536
01:53:04,550 --> 01:53:05,620
Really?
Gracie,

2537
01:53:05,780 --> 01:53:06,860
torrance.
I'm pretty sure.

2538
01:53:06,861 --> 01:53:08,120
So it's legit.
Blue belt.

2539
01:53:08,690 --> 01:53:09,840
Fucking ustream,
man.

2540
01:53:09,841 --> 01:53:11,210
You streamed.
Keeps lagging out.

2541
01:53:11,211 --> 01:53:13,820
I don't know why you keep sucking it 
lately.

2542
01:53:14,180 --> 01:53:15,710
We've got to figure out what's going on 
with this.

2543
01:53:16,010 --> 01:53:19,790
But people are complaining not 
complaining the mornings to shit's going

2544
01:53:19,791 --> 01:53:21,380
on.
Too many commercial dismissed.

2545
01:53:21,490 --> 01:53:24,470
Well that's the problem we're having.
We're just having a problem with cutting

2546
01:53:24,471 --> 01:53:26,280
out like crazy.
But is it.

2547
01:53:28,010 --> 01:53:30,590
What's that?
The app is good.

2548
01:53:30,591 --> 01:53:32,300
It's working.
But is it um,

2549
01:53:32,330 --> 01:53:34,850
when we uploaded to vimeo,
did we get a clean?

2550
01:53:35,220 --> 01:53:36,250
It's fine.
Okay.

2551
01:53:36,250 --> 01:53:41,250
So watch the video.
Don't pay attention to us while you're 

2552
01:53:41,250 --> 01:53:42,380
watching this right now anyway,
and the fact that it works on the ipad,

2553
01:53:42,381 --> 01:53:45,020
fine.
This goes to believe that it is more,

2554
01:53:45,021 --> 01:53:47,090
again,
a flash plugin problem.

2555
01:53:47,810 --> 01:53:52,810
That's interesting.
So maybe I should try it on another 

2556
01:53:52,810 --> 01:53:52,810
browser.
All right,

2557
01:53:52,810 --> 01:53:54,710
let me try it on another browser.
I'm going to shut this bitch off and I'm

2558
01:53:54,711 --> 01:53:56,510
going to try it.
When you're in chrome right there,

2559
01:53:56,710 --> 01:54:00,470
I'm going to try it on safari.
Where you have this weekend.

2560
01:54:00,471 --> 01:54:03,080
Jodie is got a couple of things this 
weekend.

2561
01:54:03,110 --> 01:54:05,150
A couple of spots.
Nothing to fucking serious.

2562
01:54:05,151 --> 01:54:07,540
Next week I go to philadelphia.
Yeah,

2563
01:54:07,640 --> 01:54:08,690
I go to fucking helium.

2564
01:54:12,300 --> 01:54:14,770
We were talking about like great clubs.
Yup.

2565
01:54:15,010 --> 01:54:20,010
Any better than that?
Doesn't get any better than the one in 

2566
01:54:20,010 --> 01:54:23,021
buffalo.
I had to change that date and I'm doing 

2567
01:54:23,021 --> 01:54:23,180
portland in september also,
so I'm pretty excited.

2568
01:54:23,210 --> 01:54:24,970
Oh,
you're doing helium in portland as well.

2569
01:54:25,070 --> 01:54:26,600
Oh,
sweet baby.

2570
01:54:26,601 --> 01:54:28,000
Jesus.
Pretty excited for philly though.

2571
01:54:28,070 --> 01:54:30,140
Got to helium.
So the bomb dude,

2572
01:54:30,280 --> 01:54:33,260
they.
What am I 12 going to open?

2573
01:54:33,261 --> 01:54:36,770
Another one in st louis.
Greg put it on safari immediately.

2574
01:54:36,771 --> 01:54:39,440
It lags out immediately.
Yeah.

2575
01:54:39,441 --> 01:54:41,750
I don't know what's going on.
You stream.

2576
01:54:41,830 --> 01:54:42,980
How's paris?
Jackson?

2577
01:54:43,490 --> 01:54:45,300
Um,
he looked like he's like 17 or so.

2578
01:54:45,301 --> 01:54:47,030
I mean the girl.
Oh,

2579
01:54:48,870 --> 01:54:52,640
I think she's like a.
She's in her teens I think.

2580
01:54:52,880 --> 01:54:55,520
I'm sure the 18 year old.
I feel bad about her.

2581
01:54:55,870 --> 01:54:57,290
Don't feel bad about all of them,
man.

2582
01:54:57,470 --> 01:54:59,180
I mean,
what a strange way to live your life.

2583
01:54:59,190 --> 01:55:01,910
If you grow up that famous,
you know,

2584
01:55:01,911 --> 01:55:06,911
what are you doing with that joey?
The reading your phone back on the 

2585
01:55:06,911 --> 01:55:11,230
email.
Sending it back and this is what I'm 

2586
01:55:11,230 --> 01:55:11,230
saying.
What?

2587
01:55:11,510 --> 01:55:12,050
Nothing.
Nothing.

2588
01:55:12,051 --> 01:55:17,051
I'm looking at this.
Little says he left us and he started 

2589
01:55:17,051 --> 01:55:17,930
emailing people like joey diaz is.
He ate a candy.

2590
01:55:17,931 --> 01:55:20,540
I don't know if anybody noticed tHis.
You heard some chewing while the show is

2591
01:55:20,541 --> 01:55:22,640
going on as a half an hour.
About an hour ago.

2592
01:55:22,641 --> 01:55:25,280
He ate a candy and it's clearly kicked 
in.

2593
01:55:25,460 --> 01:55:30,460
It hasn't kicked in.
You are disassociated from this 

2594
01:55:30,460 --> 01:55:33,071
conversation.
Motherfucker won't kick them for later 

2595
01:55:33,071 --> 01:55:33,071
on,
you know,

2596
01:55:33,071 --> 01:55:33,890
with just so.
Well this weekend is filling.

2597
01:55:34,130 --> 01:55:35,850
Next week.
Next weekend is filled.

2598
01:55:36,090 --> 01:55:39,330
You're working with my man,
dom,

2599
01:55:39,350 --> 01:55:40,710
a up at the icehouse.
Yeah,

2600
01:55:40,830 --> 01:55:43,050
I saw that.
You guys are co headlining a weekend.

2601
01:55:43,170 --> 01:55:43,480
That's the

2602
01:55:44,110 --> 01:55:45,810
beautiful world.
That's a great idea.

2603
01:55:45,870 --> 01:55:46,360
Yeah,
that's.

2604
01:55:46,410 --> 01:55:49,730
That's what a great fucking show.
I hope I got a great show.

2605
01:55:49,810 --> 01:55:54,810
They do the podcasts for them.
It's always good to see don thomas 

2606
01:55:54,810 --> 01:55:54,810
cleaning how to be a fucking comic 
again.

2607
01:55:54,810 --> 01:55:55,460
You know,
you work with tom.

2608
01:55:55,461 --> 01:55:57,510
You're like that motherfucker does it 
all.

2609
01:55:57,660 --> 01:56:00,930
He's a real monologist.
That's a different type of savage there.

2610
01:56:01,020 --> 01:56:01,430
Well,
you know,

2611
01:56:01,830 --> 01:56:03,120
all the time.
I've known don.

2612
01:56:03,550 --> 01:56:06,630
He's never faltered.
Like he's always loved being a comic and

2613
01:56:06,631 --> 01:56:07,620
that's,
you know,

2614
01:56:07,680 --> 01:56:12,680
someone was talking about it.
I think it was bill burr was saying he 

2615
01:56:12,680 --> 01:56:12,680
really loves the fact that like dom has 
been in it,

2616
01:56:12,680 --> 01:56:13,320
you know,
he was in it.

2617
01:56:13,470 --> 01:56:18,470
He was like a veteran when we all 
started and yet he still has a lot of 

2618
01:56:18,470 --> 01:56:18,690
love for it.
Some guys,

2619
01:56:18,691 --> 01:56:23,691
they fade off,
they get older and they just not funny 

2620
01:56:23,691 --> 01:56:23,691
anymore.

2621
01:56:23,691 --> 01:56:24,420
Don hasn't lost a step.
He's hilarious.

2622
01:56:25,080 --> 01:56:26,670
He's fucking hilarious,
man.

2623
01:56:26,700 --> 01:56:29,130
I watched him to stand up like before he
did that,

2624
01:56:29,131 --> 01:56:30,150
you know,
he does the talk,

2625
01:56:30,480 --> 01:56:35,480
por portion of it.
His standup is still one of the fees on 

2626
01:56:35,480 --> 01:56:38,691
tonight.
I was done that last spot down there 

2627
01:56:38,691 --> 01:56:41,031
last night.
And then on the way up I had a followup 

2628
01:56:41,031 --> 01:56:41,910
at the laugh factory.
How was that the laugh?

2629
01:56:41,911 --> 01:56:43,740
There was 30 people.
Wow.

2630
01:56:43,800 --> 01:56:44,760
But it was okay.
You know,

2631
01:56:44,761 --> 01:56:49,761
I did 30 people on monday night and then
fucking I want to put the ha and I seen 

2632
01:56:50,910 --> 01:56:53,790
david for a little while in front of 12 
people and what damon wins.

2633
01:56:53,791 --> 01:56:56,400
He's making a comeback.
It's only going through 12 people,

2634
01:56:56,580 --> 01:56:58,860
12 people.
He always liked doing that though.

2635
01:56:58,890 --> 01:57:03,890
He loved it.
He would show up at 1230 at night with 

2636
01:57:03,890 --> 01:57:08,370
pain and somebody always a and he'll,
you know what I love about damon,

2637
01:57:08,371 --> 01:57:13,371
I used to love watching damon work shit 
out because he'll like really work 

2638
01:57:13,371 --> 01:57:14,280
something out a killer,
have an idea on stage.

2639
01:57:14,300 --> 01:57:16,830
It's just Like a couple of words or a 
couple of,

2640
01:57:16,980 --> 01:57:19,110
not a couple of words,
but a couple of concepts,

2641
01:57:19,320 --> 01:57:20,700
you know,
and he'll take them.

2642
01:57:20,701 --> 01:57:24,030
And just run with him and because he's 
gotta make all these people laugh.

2643
01:57:24,210 --> 01:57:27,990
Like the pressure of that will lead him 
because he's a great writer.

2644
01:57:27,991 --> 01:57:30,750
Leads him to the best lines all the 
time.

2645
01:57:30,751 --> 01:57:32,790
I used to watch him work shit out on 
stage.

2646
01:57:33,030 --> 01:57:38,030
Like he would write right.
But he would also work shit out on 

2647
01:57:38,030 --> 01:57:39,690
stage.
Whereas mooney did a lot of writing,

2648
01:57:39,930 --> 01:57:43,290
like moonee would come in there and 
something would happen.

2649
01:57:43,470 --> 01:57:48,470
Like you remember the airplane crashed 
Florida and crashed in the swamp and 

2650
01:57:48,691 --> 01:57:51,780
mooney did a bit about old black ladies 
still clutching their purse.

2651
01:57:51,950 --> 01:57:54,270
I remember that they pull them out of 
the crocodile.

2652
01:57:54,271 --> 01:57:59,271
They still clutching their purse.
Like he had that like written like 

2653
01:57:59,271 --> 01:58:02,781
within a couple of days of,
of the the plane crash and it was a 

2654
01:58:02,781 --> 01:58:03,300
written bit,
you know,

2655
01:58:03,320 --> 01:58:03,740
he did it.

2656
01:58:04,050 --> 01:58:07,620
so he would like capitalizing.
You always have a lot of new shit but it

2657
01:58:07,621 --> 01:58:12,621
would be like a written bit.
Whereas you could see damon was like 

2658
01:58:12,621 --> 01:58:16,011
working it out while he was up there.
He would have an idea and he would just 

2659
01:58:16,011 --> 01:58:17,160
flush it out while I was up there.
And so when it would hit him,

2660
01:58:17,310 --> 01:58:20,910
like the punchline would hit him,
he would start crackinG up like not like

2661
01:58:21,090 --> 01:58:24,000
that fake cracking up shit that bad 
comedians do.

2662
01:58:24,001 --> 01:58:24,990
It's gross,
right?

2663
01:58:25,230 --> 01:58:27,570
When you see people fake laughing,
you know,

2664
01:58:27,571 --> 01:58:29,610
big bitch.
You laugh the exact same way every night

2665
01:58:29,611 --> 01:58:31,270
when you tell that joke,
that's a fake laugh,

2666
01:58:31,670 --> 01:58:32,790
you know,
that fake laugh.

2667
01:58:33,320 --> 01:58:38,320
It's gross.
But damon would like every now and then 

2668
01:58:38,320 --> 01:58:38,550
he really make himself laugh,
you know,

2669
01:58:38,551 --> 01:58:41,740
I've watched him do those late night 
sets of the store bunch of times.

2670
01:58:41,741 --> 01:58:42,100
You know,
it's

2671
01:58:42,100 --> 01:58:44,020
funny.
The other morning I was watching tv,

2672
01:58:44,021 --> 01:58:46,780
I got up and bruce lee's changed.
The world was on.

2673
01:58:46,781 --> 01:58:48,370
Eddie griffin came on.
I got to tell you,

2674
01:58:48,820 --> 01:58:52,090
a big smile came on my face before I 
walked in here.

2675
01:58:52,120 --> 01:58:55,300
Brian and I were talking about the 
comedy store and he's telling me how the

2676
01:58:55,301 --> 01:58:57,910
crew that hangs out there and how it's 
changed and blah,

2677
01:58:57,911 --> 01:59:00,060
blah blah and blah blah blah.
And you know,

2678
01:59:00,100 --> 01:59:03,550
he's enthusiastic about it.
What brian doesn't understand this.

2679
01:59:03,551 --> 01:59:06,370
I already went to fucking college there.
Do you know what I'm saying?

2680
01:59:06,670 --> 01:59:10,080
We did our fucking time.
It's not even about you or carlos' name.

2681
01:59:10,090 --> 01:59:12,730
I don't give a fuck for me.
I did my fucking time.

2682
01:59:12,740 --> 01:59:16,600
Then I did my eight years of spots and 
sundays and following dice.

2683
01:59:16,601 --> 01:59:17,550
When you got,
when you,

2684
01:59:17,700 --> 01:59:21,190
you know what it's like to have two 
other sets and you go to do your set and

2685
01:59:21,191 --> 01:59:22,360
fucking dice is going up.

2686
01:59:22,570 --> 01:59:23,740
As you pull up you're like,
oh,

2687
01:59:23,741 --> 01:59:25,180
this is going to be great and awesome.
They're like,

2688
01:59:25,450 --> 01:59:27,280
dice is going up.
Like when I was,

2689
01:59:27,290 --> 01:59:29,710
I was talking to you,
I could still see us sitting by the back

2690
01:59:30,040 --> 01:59:32,770
and mooney how he would walk up to the 
checkup bucks.

2691
01:59:33,040 --> 01:59:34,030
I'm here.
Give them the light,

2692
01:59:34,450 --> 01:59:36,700
you know,
and just all those little things.

2693
01:59:36,701 --> 01:59:38,840
That was my college,
my college.

2694
01:59:38,870 --> 01:59:40,920
But you don't go back to high school.
You don't go back to,

2695
01:59:41,200 --> 01:59:46,200
you feel like a fucking moron.
And naturally it was the comedy store 

2696
01:59:46,200 --> 01:59:49,150
for me was law school.
It was six fucking years of hard fucking

2697
01:59:49,151 --> 01:59:52,840
work of snorting,
blow fucking eating pills,

2698
01:59:52,841 --> 01:59:54,510
eating pussy,
women,

2699
01:59:55,050 --> 01:59:56,030
you know,
line.

2700
01:59:57,060 --> 02:00:00,100
Trying to get a manager trying to go up 
there and fucking get a couple of drinks

2701
02:00:00,101 --> 02:00:02,530
on a rocker coke.
It was an adventure,

2702
02:00:02,770 --> 02:00:05,110
you know,
he was saying that robert and I remember

2703
02:00:05,111 --> 02:00:08,890
the night I was up last night with the 
night,

2704
02:00:08,900 --> 02:00:11,970
we're going to light them on fire,
that I'm locked in the bathroom.

2705
02:00:11,980 --> 02:00:13,860
People throwing paper towels and they're
on fire,

2706
02:00:14,410 --> 02:00:15,160
you know,
I mean,

2707
02:00:15,161 --> 02:00:17,680
this is fucked up.
I mean it's just,

2708
02:00:17,681 --> 02:00:19,150
uh,
it's just.

2709
02:00:19,151 --> 02:00:21,430
I still remember corey cuomo calling me 
and going,

2710
02:00:21,431 --> 02:00:23,340
did you threaten him?
And corey,

2711
02:00:23,440 --> 02:00:25,030
I'm in miami.
I've been here for three weeks.

2712
02:00:25,990 --> 02:00:27,910
That's how fucking crazy he is.
Okay.

2713
02:00:28,180 --> 02:00:30,370
That's how fucking crazy robert epa 
buyers,

2714
02:00:30,830 --> 02:00:35,830
like I avoided them after that where he 
accused me of doing something and I was 

2715
02:00:35,830 --> 02:00:35,830
out of town.

2716
02:00:35,830 --> 02:00:37,400
The Bestest had him in it.
Don barris.

2717
02:00:39,390 --> 02:00:43,260
That's so crazy.
It's going on for decades.

2718
02:00:43,261 --> 02:00:44,620
Chinese guy.
What's the.

2719
02:00:44,630 --> 02:00:44,950
Don't,
don't,

2720
02:00:44,990 --> 02:00:46,960
don't you do this to rob it up?
No,

2721
02:00:46,990 --> 02:00:50,900
no he does that indicate nazis.
Nazis the finger.

2722
02:00:50,901 --> 02:00:55,901
This hitler mustache finger.
Don was on stage last night and he just 

2723
02:00:55,901 --> 02:00:56,790
runs in room.
There was like maybe like 30,

2724
02:00:56,791 --> 02:01:01,550
40 people in the room and just goes on 
stage and so on.

2725
02:01:01,610 --> 02:01:06,610
One map provides all the managers have 
to like get robert out or they're using 

2726
02:01:06,610 --> 02:01:08,430
lasers and paper towels and stuff,
but robert is still a good institution.

2727
02:01:08,890 --> 02:01:12,180
Indians and he's in an institution like 
he's a part of the store.

2728
02:01:12,380 --> 02:01:14,160
Absolutely,
and he still goes up every night.

2729
02:01:15,150 --> 02:01:16,290
Every night.
I'm nice to him.

2730
02:01:16,570 --> 02:01:18,450
I never do anything.
I'm always playing nice guy,

2731
02:01:18,451 --> 02:01:23,451
but everyone,
all the other guys always fucking throw 

2732
02:01:23,451 --> 02:01:23,451
menus.
I've always been cool.

2733
02:01:23,451 --> 02:01:23,640
I've always been really neat to see 
that.

2734
02:01:24,050 --> 02:01:29,050
Oh yeah.
I never had a beef with him till he 

2735
02:01:29,050 --> 02:01:29,050
accused me of threatening them when I 
was out of town.

2736
02:01:29,170 --> 02:01:31,610
don't understand that I was sitting on 
the stairs.

2737
02:01:32,720 --> 02:01:37,720
I was sitting on the stairs and like 
throwing paper towels and enlightened 

2738
02:01:37,720 --> 02:01:37,720
them on fire and he's in there like,
oh,

2739
02:01:37,720 --> 02:01:39,930
what's the smell?
Fire run out of there.

2740
02:01:39,931 --> 02:01:40,100
You

2741
02:01:40,300 --> 02:01:42,150
walk.
It was really dangerous with him because

2742
02:01:42,160 --> 02:01:42,530
you,
your member,

2743
02:01:42,531 --> 02:01:47,531
especially in the winter,
he would insulate himself with plastic 

2744
02:01:47,531 --> 02:01:49,280
bags.
He had these plastic bags,

2745
02:01:49,340 --> 02:01:53,990
the stuff inside of his clothes keep 
them warm because he would walk home and

2746
02:01:53,991 --> 02:01:55,820
he'd be in downtown,
so he didn't.

2747
02:01:55,910 --> 02:01:58,910
He'd walked downtown like when he would 
leave the comedy store,

2748
02:01:58,911 --> 02:02:01,970
he would walk like five miles.
That was no joke.

2749
02:02:02,810 --> 02:02:04,460
Like he that he did that all the time.

2750
02:02:04,670 --> 02:02:09,670
He,
he still does that and he goes to the 

2751
02:02:09,670 --> 02:02:09,980
grocery store after every show,
every night he does it,

2752
02:02:10,000 --> 02:02:14,120
gets the exact same thing,
like a banana and like a sandwich.

2753
02:02:14,240 --> 02:02:17,590
And don paris does tHe exact same thing.
He follows him into it.

2754
02:02:19,960 --> 02:02:21,920
That's so fucked up,
man.

2755
02:02:22,280 --> 02:02:23,030
What?
You know,

2756
02:02:23,031 --> 02:02:27,020
that's one of those things that the 
store had was those long running gags.

2757
02:02:27,230 --> 02:02:29,360
Like,
do you remember what o'brian counts?

2758
02:02:29,361 --> 02:02:31,430
Still does it with don burris every 
time.

2759
02:02:31,431 --> 02:02:32,650
Brian callahan,
tom paris,

2760
02:02:32,660 --> 02:02:37,660
he's each other.
He pretends that brian brian pretends 

2761
02:02:37,660 --> 02:02:39,910
that dom buress is forcing them to suck 
his cock and so fights it off for awhile

2762
02:02:40,130 --> 02:02:45,130
and they're like put on a show.
And then finally Brian Campbell put his 

2763
02:02:45,130 --> 02:02:45,130
lips right on.
Barris,

2764
02:02:45,130 --> 02:02:47,070
his cock and,
and,

2765
02:02:47,310 --> 02:02:49,940
and,
and barrels will be humping his face.

2766
02:02:49,941 --> 02:02:52,070
It's so fucking,
and they go for it.

2767
02:02:52,071 --> 02:02:53,720
It's so uncomfortable to watch.

2768
02:02:54,140 --> 02:02:59,140
This is a new who is robert from two 
nights ago and there's a girl on stage 

2769
02:02:59,140 --> 02:03:03,401
with no clothes on.
She never wears underwear.

2770
02:03:03,741 --> 02:03:05,810
She always brags about fucking ron.
Jeremy.

2771
02:03:06,300 --> 02:03:08,570
Could you tell us on stage or on the.
YeaH,

2772
02:03:08,571 --> 02:03:10,430
it's totally fine.
But she,

2773
02:03:10,431 --> 02:03:11,030
uh,
she,

2774
02:03:11,060 --> 02:03:14,780
she's been like going on stage and like 
showing her vagina to him and stuff like

2775
02:03:14,781 --> 02:03:17,810
that and he shows them to robert.
It's getting real nervous

2776
02:03:17,890 --> 02:03:19,330
by the way.
How durable is that?

2777
02:03:19,331 --> 02:03:24,331
jacket and pants jacket and pants is 100
years old.

2778
02:03:24,431 --> 02:03:29,431
this motherfucker's been wearing that 
same jacket pants every day for a long 

2779
02:03:29,431 --> 02:03:30,490
time.
Those are some strong threads.

2780
02:03:30,810 --> 02:03:35,810
Yeah,
I think he might have a few of them 

2781
02:03:35,810 --> 02:03:35,810
though.
So this girl,

2782
02:03:35,810 --> 02:03:36,950
she goes on stage all the time,
like all the girls.

2783
02:03:36,951 --> 02:03:38,210
This is from last night,
you know,

2784
02:03:38,211 --> 02:03:41,540
there's mary jane and eleanor and stuff 
like that.

2785
02:03:41,541 --> 02:03:43,250
And eleanor was there.
Oh yeah,

2786
02:03:43,251 --> 02:03:44,640
she's there every night.
She really.

2787
02:03:44,710 --> 02:03:49,710
Yeah.
But it's cool because all these girls 

2788
02:03:49,710 --> 02:03:49,710
are on like the ding dong show and stuff
like that.

2789
02:03:49,710 --> 02:03:52,520
But it's fun.
Tylenol is very funny,

2790
02:03:52,521 --> 02:03:54,680
man.
She's a very funny stand up now.

2791
02:03:54,710 --> 02:03:59,710
It's interesting.
We always kind of knew she was a funny 

2792
02:03:59,710 --> 02:04:00,830
person when she was working at the 
store.

2793
02:04:01,100 --> 02:04:02,420
Are these all standups?
These girls?

2794
02:04:02,510 --> 02:04:04,400
Yeah.
That's a schizophrenia surfer.

2795
02:04:04,401 --> 02:04:06,650
He's got schizophrenia,
schizophrenia and he,

2796
02:04:06,651 --> 02:04:11,651
I used to do open mics with him and in 
west hall or in a cafe while you're 

2797
02:04:11,651 --> 02:04:13,070
talking about the point when I'm asking 
him about the girls,

2798
02:04:14,810 --> 02:04:15,920
girls in their underwear and it's like,
yeah,

2799
02:04:15,921 --> 02:04:17,330
that guy.
So there's mary jane,

2800
02:04:17,331 --> 02:04:22,331
her don's girlfriend.
So these girls are all standup 

2801
02:04:22,331 --> 02:04:25,510
comedians.
So the like a community down there of 

2802
02:04:25,510 --> 02:04:25,510
girls stand.
Oh yeah.

2803
02:04:25,510 --> 02:04:26,780
And what's cool is that me and tony 
hinchcliffe,

2804
02:04:26,781 --> 02:04:28,750
sap podcasts have a,
uh,

2805
02:04:28,790 --> 02:04:33,790
two girls stand ups that started on the 
show and they've never done standup 

2806
02:04:33,790 --> 02:04:34,250
comedy before.
And every week we get tHem,

2807
02:04:34,280 --> 02:04:36,920
given them one minute and they're like,
that's awesome.

2808
02:04:36,930 --> 02:04:37,790
Yeah.
Yeah.

2809
02:04:37,800 --> 02:04:38,090
Stand

2810
02:04:38,090 --> 02:04:39,870
up comedy.
It needs more chicks.

2811
02:04:39,910 --> 02:04:41,400
It's not enough funny checks in this 
world.

2812
02:04:42,150 --> 02:04:44,580
I don't know when things are going bad 
like they are now.

2813
02:04:44,820 --> 02:04:47,370
That's when more funny ones will rise.
Is more funny,

2814
02:04:47,371 --> 02:04:49,500
crazy bitches or wherever you shop 
somewhere.

2815
02:04:50,630 --> 02:04:54,390
Jerry lewis did well.
He says it went off a month ago.

2816
02:04:54,410 --> 02:04:55,620
What did he do?
Dirty bitches.

2817
02:04:55,650 --> 02:04:57,120
He doesn't think women are funny,
right?

2818
02:04:57,450 --> 02:04:59,880
I can't stand them talking to me.
I don't think that funny.

2819
02:04:59,940 --> 02:05:02,070
I laugh.
There's plenty of funny women.

2820
02:05:02,490 --> 02:05:04,530
THat's a silly thing to say.
This is funny.

2821
02:05:04,531 --> 02:05:06,420
People.
If someone's funny,

2822
02:05:06,421 --> 02:05:08,730
they're funny.
The idea that you would say that they're

2823
02:05:08,731 --> 02:05:11,160
not funny because they're check.
Tell me morgan murphy stuff.

2824
02:05:11,161 --> 02:05:13,080
Funny to pitches.
Hilarious.

2825
02:05:13,560 --> 02:05:15,020
She's lyrics.
Sarah silverman's not funny.

2826
02:05:15,090 --> 02:05:17,100
Sarah silverman is fucking hilarious.

2827
02:05:17,390 --> 02:05:22,390
This girl right here,
this is katie means out of the girls 

2828
02:05:22,390 --> 02:05:24,590
who's mom was married to hugh hefner.
This girl right here though.

2829
02:05:24,591 --> 02:05:29,591
Her name is jessica shores and she has a
music video that she just put out like a

2830
02:05:30,530 --> 02:05:34,330
month ago that already.
It has like one point 2 million hits and

2831
02:05:34,640 --> 02:05:36,800
her dancing around with you.
If you look at it though,

2832
02:05:36,830 --> 02:05:39,850
you'll let her.
I when I left last.

2833
02:05:40,430 --> 02:05:42,140
Nope.
I don't know.

2834
02:05:42,410 --> 02:05:47,410
I won't laugh my ass off.
I can't believe we're still talking 

2835
02:05:47,410 --> 02:05:48,400
about it.
You would in a a laugh about it way.

2836
02:05:48,860 --> 02:05:49,510
Yeah.
No,

2837
02:05:49,610 --> 02:05:49,960
thanks.

2838
02:05:50,920 --> 02:05:52,480
I've been there.
I've done that.

2839
02:05:52,630 --> 02:05:57,630
Stop trying to make me sad.
You never get a hankering to go back 

2840
02:05:57,630 --> 02:06:01,531
there and we drive by.
Do you ever wish you could just pull it 

2841
02:06:01,531 --> 02:06:01,531
into our set?
No.

2842
02:06:01,531 --> 02:06:03,040
No shit.
Still you're doing the improv.

2843
02:06:03,041 --> 02:06:06,010
I been there lately.
Just got a text from rita.

2844
02:06:06,020 --> 02:06:08,910
I gotta text her back.
The improv is a I.

2845
02:06:09,090 --> 02:06:11,350
That bar freaks me out.
Oh,

2846
02:06:11,351 --> 02:06:13,450
the persian barring the bar.
I'm like,

2847
02:06:13,451 --> 02:06:18,451
what?
What does this recessed lighting the 

2848
02:06:18,451 --> 02:06:18,451
fucking lamps built into the wall and 
shit.

2849
02:06:18,451 --> 02:06:19,670
I'm like,
what are you guys doing?

2850
02:06:19,970 --> 02:06:22,240
Glad you said that,
because I was like,

2851
02:06:22,241 --> 02:06:25,130
you need a corner that you can suck at 
the end.

2852
02:06:25,300 --> 02:06:27,520
There's no.
There's no hidden corners here.

2853
02:06:27,640 --> 02:06:30,220
It doesn't feel like a comedy club.
It all with white booths.

2854
02:06:30,370 --> 02:06:33,040
Like where are we?
Are we in miami in 1998.

2855
02:06:33,100 --> 02:06:35,890
It feels like a hotel room or a hotel 
bar.

2856
02:06:36,050 --> 02:06:37,550
Yeah,
it feels like a road gig.

2857
02:06:37,580 --> 02:06:42,580
Yeah,
it feels like a gig you would do if 

2858
02:06:42,580 --> 02:06:42,580
you're in western Massachusetts where 
they had like the bar.

2859
02:06:42,580 --> 02:06:47,050
The club still is great once you get 
inside the actual setup is pretty 

2860
02:06:47,050 --> 02:06:47,510
fucking perfect,
you know,

2861
02:06:47,511 --> 02:06:49,400
and the way they have it now with the 
bar over there,

2862
02:06:49,401 --> 02:06:54,401
it does have less noise because people 
have to leave and go down that hall and 

2863
02:06:54,401 --> 02:06:58,631
then take a right and then take a left.
So it's probably like quieter for them 

2864
02:06:58,631 --> 02:06:59,420
that way.
It just seems weird.

2865
02:06:59,660 --> 02:07:02,570
I guess that that annex though,
it wasn't making any money,

2866
02:07:03,140 --> 02:07:04,790
you know?
Also they got rid of the annex.

2867
02:07:04,840 --> 02:07:06,200
Annex doesn't exist anymore.
Well

2868
02:07:06,220 --> 02:07:08,520
they were the bars.
We're also renting out the,

2869
02:07:08,521 --> 02:07:11,090
the front part of it to a hamburger 
place.

2870
02:07:11,510 --> 02:07:13,770
So kind of hamburgers going to be that 
umami.

2871
02:07:13,830 --> 02:07:14,990
It's actually.
Oh,

2872
02:07:15,030 --> 02:07:17,240
nami burger.
I don't know if I've had those before.

2873
02:07:17,890 --> 02:07:19,250
The weirdest thing,
the weirdest.

2874
02:07:19,280 --> 02:07:21,290
The weirdest thing is,
is that the murals I,

2875
02:07:21,320 --> 02:07:22,610
if you've ever been to the hollywood 
improv,

2876
02:07:22,640 --> 02:07:25,580
we used to have like these big drawings 
or paintings on over him.

2877
02:07:25,610 --> 02:07:27,610
Yeah.
And they're just this new mural that all

2878
02:07:27,630 --> 02:07:28,880
the people.
Yeah,

2879
02:07:28,881 --> 02:07:33,881
and it's huge and it's just a bunch of 
comics and you sit there and you're 

2880
02:07:33,881 --> 02:07:35,590
trying to figure out who's who.
Everyone does not look like who they are

2881
02:07:35,591 --> 02:07:35,980
and it looks

2882
02:07:35,980 --> 02:07:38,220
really like a picture.
How I,

2883
02:07:38,260 --> 02:07:43,260
the only picture I have is there's only 
one microphone on this mural like and 

2884
02:07:43,260 --> 02:07:45,040
there's only one person standing in 
front of the microphone and this is like

2885
02:07:45,041 --> 02:07:50,041
a simulation theory,
but that one thing is a fucking dolphin 

2886
02:07:50,041 --> 02:07:50,670
for some reason,
for no reason at all.

2887
02:07:51,040 --> 02:07:56,040
A dolphin in front of the microphone and
then you could kind of see a couple of 

2888
02:07:56,040 --> 02:07:57,190
comics here.
Like I can't tell.

2889
02:07:57,240 --> 02:07:58,980
I know who that is.
Just the puppets.

2890
02:07:59,030 --> 02:08:01,150
That's the only photo of it.
That's the only photo I have.

2891
02:08:01,210 --> 02:08:03,730
I can find,
see if I can find like only a partial of

2892
02:08:03,731 --> 02:08:08,731
the part of the euro dolphin.
It's weird that it would have on 

2893
02:08:08,731 --> 02:08:12,040
sunglasses too.
I dunno man.

2894
02:08:12,310 --> 02:08:14,710
There's no.
There's no rhyme or reason.

2895
02:08:14,890 --> 02:08:17,500
there's no logic to why they would take 
down those other paintings.

2896
02:08:17,501 --> 02:08:18,640
Those pins were old as fuck.

2897
02:08:18,640 --> 02:08:21,220
There was like a part of history I think
here.

2898
02:08:21,490 --> 02:08:22,540
I think here's the,
uh,

2899
02:08:23,050 --> 02:08:25,210
here's the,
here's a new story about it.

2900
02:08:25,510 --> 02:08:28,060
The new mural.
Oh god,

2901
02:08:28,360 --> 02:08:33,360
there's a story in the news.
You always comedy club in west hollywood

2902
02:08:35,930 --> 02:08:39,450
comics for conservation.
It's happening right now.

2903
02:08:39,460 --> 02:08:40,430
We'll see.
Look at that mural.

2904
02:08:42,150 --> 02:08:47,150
There's the dolphin fast,
incredible mural over the past couple of

2905
02:08:47,740 --> 02:08:49,630
days here.
Let's look at it.

2906
02:08:49,660 --> 02:08:52,520
You can't robin williams,
you'll,

2907
02:08:52,540 --> 02:08:55,040
you'll sit here and look at it and you 
won't even,

2908
02:08:55,180 --> 02:08:58,780
you can't even figure out half a 
terrible piece of artwork.

2909
02:08:59,370 --> 02:09:04,370
I don't want to say it's terrible.
So his style does not look like the 

2910
02:09:04,370 --> 02:09:04,700
people at all.
Like,

2911
02:09:04,750 --> 02:09:07,660
like if you look at Jeff Ross,
it looks like Jeff Ross,

2912
02:09:07,750 --> 02:09:09,370
Jeff Ross,
special needs.

2913
02:09:11,960 --> 02:09:14,810
That is where they have the unknown 
comic with a paper bag over said,

2914
02:09:15,400 --> 02:09:17,340
thank god.
So now the entrance,

2915
02:09:17,341 --> 02:09:18,550
it's over here.
Where the,

2916
02:09:19,000 --> 02:09:20,800
what the fuck I'm mural.
Is that?

2917
02:09:21,050 --> 02:09:22,300
Yeah.
And there's so many.

2918
02:09:22,420 --> 02:09:26,650
Like there was somebody there that,
I forget who it was that george carlin's

2919
02:09:26,680 --> 02:09:27,960
pretty obvious.
Well,

2920
02:09:27,961 --> 02:09:30,730
some of the people like really obvious.
It's pretty obvious,

2921
02:09:30,790 --> 02:09:34,570
but let's see if I can get it.
I don't want to make fun of it,

2922
02:09:34,571 --> 02:09:36,020
but it's just shut it off.
let's.

2923
02:09:36,080 --> 02:09:38,320
Let's be nice,
but it doesn't matter.

2924
02:09:38,321 --> 02:09:43,321
That's what the comments are saying.
It's kind of weird going over there now 

2925
02:09:43,321 --> 02:09:43,321
because people are like,
what's up with this bar?

2926
02:09:43,321 --> 02:09:46,120
And it was just crazy mural.
Somebody fucked up.

2927
02:09:46,450 --> 02:09:51,450
Somebody's got crazy and they forgot 
that things are nice when they stay the 

2928
02:09:51,450 --> 02:09:51,450
same.
Yep.

2929
02:09:51,450 --> 02:09:52,310
They forgot the end of the day.
Who gives a fuck?

2930
02:09:52,620 --> 02:09:55,850
Fuck,
fuck,

2931
02:09:56,500 --> 02:09:58,240
fuck.
Fuck.

2932
02:09:58,690 --> 02:10:00,250
Jesus christ.
Joe diaz.

2933
02:10:00,400 --> 02:10:02,800
You know what I'm saying?
Who gives a fuck about some fucking ugly

2934
02:10:02,910 --> 02:10:04,510
ass?
That's what I'm saying.

2935
02:10:04,630 --> 02:10:05,570
That's what I'm saying,
dawg.

2936
02:10:07,610 --> 02:10:11,140
What else was like a motherfucker will 
movies you see lately?

2937
02:10:11,141 --> 02:10:16,141
Anything good?
I saw despicables a movie and it was a 

2938
02:10:16,141 --> 02:10:19,620
good move.
They just kid movies.

2939
02:10:19,621 --> 02:10:23,530
So good fucking movie.
Almost good cartoons now.

2940
02:10:23,531 --> 02:10:26,170
Fuck television.
Fuck all that family guy.

2941
02:10:26,171 --> 02:10:28,030
I'm watching spongebob.
that's the shit.

2942
02:10:28,230 --> 02:10:31,010
You're fucking lives in a pineapple.
It's true under the seat.

2943
02:10:31,210 --> 02:10:33,340
It's true.
Is it good because of the three d or you

2944
02:10:33,341 --> 02:10:33,920
just.
Did you

2945
02:10:34,330 --> 02:10:35,840
just like.
The first one was great.

2946
02:10:35,990 --> 02:10:38,440
The first one's not bad either.
They're going to the movies.

2947
02:10:38,480 --> 02:10:40,540
I love all that shit.
Then it's like it's.

2948
02:10:40,810 --> 02:10:43,960
I mean obviously I went for my kids but 
it's legitimately good movie,

2949
02:10:43,970 --> 02:10:45,500
but that's where they put that fucking 
screen.

2950
02:10:45,530 --> 02:10:48,390
That's why they put the creativity and 
the kid shit in the adult.

2951
02:10:48,391 --> 02:10:49,160
Shit.
You sit there.

2952
02:10:49,340 --> 02:10:52,010
my friend said you went to see the end 
of the world.

2953
02:10:52,011 --> 02:10:54,070
We lAst night and this guy is a white 
dude,

2954
02:10:54,080 --> 02:10:57,540
is very geeky and he went to see the 
Kevin Hart means at the end of the world

2955
02:10:57,541 --> 02:11:00,440
you had to walk out of really.
And Kevin Hart thing was okay,

2956
02:11:00,441 --> 02:11:03,050
that was just too big to do stand up at 
the garden.

2957
02:11:03,051 --> 02:11:08,051
He felt like it was just too big.
The tape day he goes at the end and he 

2958
02:11:08,051 --> 02:11:09,280
watched the credit and he goes,
it was 30 fucking camera man.

2959
02:11:10,300 --> 02:11:11,960
You know what I'm saying?
30th camera man.

2960
02:11:12,440 --> 02:11:15,020
So it just didn't feel intimate and make
them feel intimate enough,

2961
02:11:15,021 --> 02:11:17,330
which I,
when you're doing those fucking places,

2962
02:11:17,630 --> 02:11:18,340
you don't,
you feel,

2963
02:11:18,350 --> 02:11:20,410
you don't feel intimidated,
you know,

2964
02:11:20,540 --> 02:11:22,390
there's a certain level,
like $1,800

2965
02:11:22,391 --> 02:11:24,890
or something after that,
it's all downhill after that.

2966
02:11:25,130 --> 02:11:30,130
For a guy that rants,
it's downhill for a guy who's very 

2967
02:11:30,130 --> 02:11:30,380
slowly.
When we seen the guy in jersey,

2968
02:11:30,680 --> 02:11:32,000
a slow pace,
that's great.

2969
02:11:32,300 --> 02:11:36,900
but a guy who steps on his own lines and
I just don't like it.

2970
02:11:36,930 --> 02:11:41,930
It was absolutely right.
That is the issue when people laugh and 

2971
02:11:41,930 --> 02:11:42,830
you can't hear what they're saying.
I don't like 1800 or above.

2972
02:11:43,330 --> 02:11:44,790
You don't want.
It's nice money.

2973
02:11:44,791 --> 02:11:45,740
Yeah,
we have a good time,

2974
02:11:45,741 --> 02:11:47,860
but I don't feel good when I walk off 
the set.

2975
02:11:47,861 --> 02:11:51,380
I don't feel like I did nothing.
I'm just struggling to talk slow.

2976
02:11:51,380 --> 02:11:53,590
My patois jb.
All my timing was off.

2977
02:11:54,270 --> 02:11:55,280
You know?
I liked it.

2978
02:11:55,281 --> 02:12:00,281
That's why I'm,
I don't know where I want to shoot a 

2979
02:12:00,281 --> 02:12:02,021
special.
I'd like to shoot it at somewhere where 

2980
02:12:02,021 --> 02:12:02,021
it's fucking small.
I don't want to do theaters.

2981
02:12:02,021 --> 02:12:03,350
I don't want people to come see me in a 
fucking.

2982
02:12:03,440 --> 02:12:04,710
They ended up punching.
I honestly,

2983
02:12:04,840 --> 02:12:06,150
atlanta punch.
I was a great idea.

2984
02:12:06,700 --> 02:12:11,700
That's a great idea.
I honestly think 300 is the threshold 

2985
02:12:11,700 --> 02:12:14,130
for things getting different to 72,
seven,

2986
02:12:14,131 --> 02:12:14,650
two,
seven,

2987
02:12:14,830 --> 02:12:16,420
9:50
gets a little kinky,

2988
02:12:17,220 --> 02:12:20,130
put even carbs.
It's tremendous.

2989
02:12:20,350 --> 02:12:21,890
It's big though.
It's too bad.

2990
02:12:21,950 --> 02:12:26,950
Carbs is tremendous.
And then when you have the Little thing 

2991
02:12:26,950 --> 02:12:26,950
on top,
that's a little fucked up too.

2992
02:12:26,950 --> 02:12:31,840
On top of it.
In the back it goes way back and above 

2993
02:12:31,840 --> 02:12:35,080
this we don't sell much of a connection 
is a perfect place to take this perfect 

2994
02:12:35,080 --> 02:12:35,080
place.

2995
02:12:35,080 --> 02:12:37,040
American comedy co because they're not 
bad either,

2996
02:12:37,250 --> 02:12:38,710
but there's a lot of pillars and that 
spot.

2997
02:12:39,240 --> 02:12:41,140
I don't want to shoot in California.
That's the problem.

2998
02:12:41,600 --> 02:12:44,980
We do shit here.
Do we want to go somewhere to light up a

2999
02:12:45,000 --> 02:12:47,930
state like grand funk railroad?
We're an american band.

3000
02:12:48,050 --> 02:12:53,050
Will come through your town.
We're running american fucking man.

3001
02:12:54,020 --> 02:12:57,130
Are you kidding me?
That's a jam dog.

3002
02:12:57,470 --> 02:12:59,810
Listen to that will help you.
Partied down.

3003
02:13:00,500 --> 02:13:03,590
We'll bring cheap cheekbones refa 
papers.

3004
02:13:03,620 --> 02:13:04,550
Yeah.
No,

3005
02:13:04,551 --> 02:13:09,551
that's it.
So I want to go somewhere when you do a 

3006
02:13:09,551 --> 02:13:09,551
set in la,
it's fun,

3007
02:13:09,551 --> 02:13:10,540
it's great.
but they could see us anytime.

3008
02:13:11,900 --> 02:13:13,800
I could.
If I was ruling ck,

3009
02:13:13,950 --> 02:13:16,850
you jump up and down.
If I was fucking,

3010
02:13:16,851 --> 02:13:18,230
you know,
Kevin Hart,

3011
02:13:18,231 --> 02:13:19,970
I do fucking whatever.
Stand up,

3012
02:13:19,971 --> 02:13:21,260
live downtown,
whatever.

3013
02:13:21,261 --> 02:13:23,960
That's.
But I'm not and I never got to.

3014
02:13:24,110 --> 02:13:27,290
I don't want to do that kind of standup.
I Rather put smaller.

3015
02:13:27,500 --> 02:13:30,700
That's why I do good when I got on a 
rant and shit in a big theater.

3016
02:13:30,701 --> 02:13:32,250
I it what's also,

3017
02:13:32,250 --> 02:13:34,800
it's a matter of how much money do you 
really need?

3018
02:13:34,950 --> 02:13:37,710
Because if you start getting into the 
eight and 10,000

3019
02:13:37,711 --> 02:13:42,711
seats,
it's one thing if you're doing it 

3020
02:13:42,711 --> 02:13:42,711
because the demand is really high.
You don't want anybody to not be able to

3021
02:13:42,711 --> 02:13:44,970
go because you know,
the shows would be all sold out,

3022
02:13:45,420 --> 02:13:48,000
but you can make a lot of money Just 
doing clubs.

3023
02:13:48,030 --> 02:13:53,030
I mean,
how much money does a comic need to 

3024
02:13:53,030 --> 02:13:53,030
exist in this life?
You know,

3025
02:13:53,030 --> 02:13:55,380
if you're,
if you're living like a normal person,

3026
02:13:55,990 --> 02:13:58,560
you can do clubs and you can make plenty
of money.

3027
02:13:58,800 --> 02:14:02,250
You know,
but the show will be more like you,

3028
02:14:02,430 --> 02:14:05,370
like I can go see you in a hundred 
seats.

3029
02:14:05,371 --> 02:14:08,130
You can be screaming and yelling at the 
top of your lungs and ran.

3030
02:14:08,160 --> 02:14:10,410
I'll know every word that comes out of 
your mouth.

3031
02:14:10,620 --> 02:14:11,700
There'll be no questions.

3032
02:14:11,820 --> 02:14:13,290
What did he say?
I couldn't hear.

3033
02:14:13,500 --> 02:14:16,680
There'd be none of that,
but when you get into those two and 3000

3034
02:14:16,681 --> 02:14:21,681
seat places,
there are a moment and I noticed that 

3035
02:14:21,681 --> 02:14:22,080
when we watched that guy in jersey,
there was a moment.

3036
02:14:22,081 --> 02:14:27,081
There was a few moments where I didn't 
know what he had said because he was 

3037
02:14:27,081 --> 02:14:27,450
like ranting as they were laughing and I
was like,

3038
02:14:27,510 --> 02:14:29,130
oh,
this is interesting.

3039
02:14:29,160 --> 02:14:34,160
Very interesting.
Dynamics were great for a 2,400

3040
02:14:34,530 --> 02:14:36,690
seat theater.
The dynamIcs of chicago.

3041
02:14:36,990 --> 02:14:38,070
Oh yeah.
tremendous.

3042
02:14:38,071 --> 02:14:40,360
I rented there and they came up 
perfectly,

3043
02:14:40,770 --> 02:14:45,300
but that's a very few and far between 
that that place is magical.

3044
02:14:45,960 --> 02:14:48,750
Magical.
I would also consider shooting a special

3045
02:14:48,751 --> 02:14:51,090
if it wasn't so big in the place we did 
in pittsburgh.

3046
02:14:51,690 --> 02:14:54,660
That was a great place to theater.
That was the carnegie library,

3047
02:14:54,661 --> 02:14:56,350
lord god,
that was.

3048
02:14:56,680 --> 02:15:00,360
That was used to be an old library,
was no library.

3049
02:15:00,360 --> 02:15:05,360
There's so many places.
If I could find a good old fucking 

3050
02:15:05,360 --> 02:15:06,320
joint,
600 seats in it,

3051
02:15:06,340 --> 02:15:08,280
you should just do it at helium,
man.

3052
02:15:08,370 --> 02:15:09,920
I want to do that.
Either helium,

3053
02:15:09,930 --> 02:15:11,280
portland,
do it important.

3054
02:15:11,370 --> 02:15:14,840
They'll go crazy.
I want to do a brick wall.

3055
02:15:15,730 --> 02:15:17,700
A brick wall,
a brick wall.

3056
02:15:18,060 --> 02:15:20,670
What does portland have giggled?
We can put this up.

3057
02:15:21,280 --> 02:15:22,340
Giggles,
giggles.

3058
02:15:22,770 --> 02:15:26,310
Helium giggles is a comedy club that I 
used to do in boston.

3059
02:15:26,311 --> 02:15:27,030
Boston.
Yeah.

3060
02:15:27,220 --> 02:15:32,220
Giggles was also in seattle.
A place that was run by the Vietnam vet 

3061
02:15:32,220 --> 02:15:33,550
that would take a draw from them on 
thursday by saturday.

3062
02:15:33,551 --> 02:15:38,551
He forgot he was and then I call them 
monday asking who was then next week and

3063
02:15:38,641 --> 02:15:40,230
he'd go over his last time you worked at
club.

3064
02:15:40,980 --> 02:15:41,820
Oh,
that's hilarious.

3065
02:15:42,130 --> 02:15:44,490
Years ago.
Friday he had.

3066
02:15:44,520 --> 02:15:49,520
He forgot that bad everything.
Once I learned I would get the waitress 

3067
02:15:49,520 --> 02:15:50,600
on saturday and find that.

3068
02:15:50,600 --> 02:15:54,630
What was the feature act next week on 
monday nine slash 11.

3069
02:15:55,440 --> 02:15:57,000
What's up buddy?
Joe diaz.

3070
02:15:57,120 --> 02:15:59,190
Who's featuring this week.
When was the last time you were at?

3071
02:15:59,191 --> 02:16:04,191
My club was a year ago.
You had to be fucking spotless clean.

3072
02:16:04,800 --> 02:16:06,990
Right?
But he wouldn't show up until to see the

3073
02:16:06,991 --> 02:16:11,991
headliner and there was a curtain on the
stage and you can see this jaguar pull 

3074
02:16:11,991 --> 02:16:11,991
up.
Oh,

3075
02:16:11,991 --> 02:16:16,401
that's a jaguar pulled up.
I did my clean stuff as soon as you 

3076
02:16:16,401 --> 02:16:16,770
want.
If you only come in for one minute and I

3077
02:16:16,771 --> 02:16:20,740
just bombed for two minutes,
look at the back and going,

3078
02:16:21,660 --> 02:16:23,700
this is hysterical.
This is how much,

3079
02:16:23,701 --> 02:16:25,530
how?
This is how a box this guy was.

3080
02:16:25,950 --> 02:16:28,890
I forget the guy's name.
He's a track coach and seattle,

3081
02:16:28,900 --> 02:16:30,190
very good guy was

3082
02:16:30,190 --> 02:16:32,440
on hbo.
She's just a college track coach.

3083
02:16:32,650 --> 02:16:36,250
He doesn't travel as much.
He was headlining and he's a great comic

3084
02:16:36,251 --> 02:16:39,280
and a great monologist.
He's completely clean.

3085
02:16:40,000 --> 02:16:43,480
This motherfucker gets off stage and the
owner of the club goes up and he goes,

3086
02:16:43,870 --> 02:16:48,870
let me tell you something.
I went in there three minutes ago when 

3087
02:16:48,870 --> 02:16:48,870
you were being dirty.
Don't ever do that in my cLub.

3088
02:16:48,870 --> 02:16:50,200
He's like me

3089
02:16:51,870 --> 02:16:52,750
and finally comes up

3090
02:16:52,810 --> 02:16:57,060
because I was just about to ratchet,
but I remember he's a Vietnam vet and he

3091
02:16:57,061 --> 02:16:58,240
got hit with a missile or something.

3092
02:16:59,450 --> 02:17:04,450
He sold it.
He sold the club to a mormon and yes,

3093
02:17:04,720 --> 02:17:09,720
we talked about the mormon.
Got mad at us and then he offered me a 

3094
02:17:10,610 --> 02:17:12,440
week up there.
Now it's done.

3095
02:17:12,650 --> 02:17:13,440
Yeah,
it's done.

3096
02:17:13,460 --> 02:17:18,460
Yeah.
He got bad because he had sent somebody 

3097
02:17:18,460 --> 02:17:21,090
home or said someone couldn't work there
or something changed salmon or san jose,

3098
02:17:21,830 --> 02:17:23,420
one of those guys,
once someone,

3099
02:17:23,421 --> 02:17:25,850
someone had problems with them and so I 
was,

3100
02:17:25,910 --> 02:17:30,000
I just wanted to put the word out so 
that I can't work wise guys and advil.

3101
02:17:30,020 --> 02:17:31,880
he was,
he was in wise guys in salt lake.

3102
02:17:31,881 --> 02:17:34,340
He left and he bought giggles.
Uh,

3103
02:17:34,341 --> 02:17:35,960
so I never did that club.
That was,

3104
02:17:35,961 --> 02:17:38,300
I think I'd heard about it,
but it was like,

3105
02:17:38,330 --> 02:17:40,330
you gotta be,
you have to be cleaned.

3106
02:17:40,430 --> 02:17:42,110
And then he left bobby slayton work 
there.

3107
02:17:42,111 --> 02:17:43,370
That was what he did.
He called them.

3108
02:17:43,371 --> 02:17:43,640
He goes,
no,

3109
02:17:43,641 --> 02:17:43,780
no,
no,

3110
02:17:43,781 --> 02:17:45,650
no.
I don't allow cleaning.

3111
02:17:45,651 --> 02:17:48,680
But bobby slayton work there and he was 
saying something like,

3112
02:17:48,681 --> 02:17:50,900
this is not my cup of tea,
you know,

3113
02:17:50,901 --> 02:17:55,901
like he,
he said it was when he was bringing up 

3114
02:17:55,901 --> 02:17:56,030
the show or something like that.
This is not my type of show.

3115
02:17:56,031 --> 02:17:59,510
I just want to say that like he like 
introduced the show that way and someone

3116
02:17:59,511 --> 02:18:02,180
was offended and he was a shimano or it 
was bobby,

3117
02:18:02,480 --> 02:18:04,100
bobby slayton,

02:18:05,430 --> 02:18:10,430

They're trying to get.
It's an extradition warrant.

3133
02:18:54,370 --> 02:18:57,450
They won't hunt me down anyway,
but if I get caught in seattle,

3134
02:18:57,460 --> 02:19:00,670
they're going to arrest me and they're 
going to keep me in that because it's an

3135
02:19:00,671 --> 02:19:05,671

3159
02:20:00,050 --> 02:20:01,940
That more theater.
That's what I'm doing.

3160
02:20:02,660 --> 02:20:06,390
I'm doing me and sigora shadows a 
fucking bad ass town.

3161
02:20:07,160 --> 02:20:10,530
We had a good time up there when I was 
looking for bigfoot to drop.

3162
02:20:10,600 --> 02:20:13,100
They're squashing someplace I 
disrespected but not really.

3163
02:20:13,310 --> 02:20:14,750
why did you do respect it?
This,

3164
02:20:14,900 --> 02:20:17,400
I lived up there with that fucking 
filthy animals.

3165
02:20:17,820 --> 02:20:20,300
It was,
ended up choking her out.

3166
02:20:20,750 --> 02:20:21,550
she stabbed me.

3167
02:20:24,090 --> 02:20:26,720
Disrespect in seattle because of that,
you know.

3168
02:20:26,721 --> 02:20:31,721
And that'S why like I broke right now.
I love to get outta here and I love you 

3169
02:20:31,721 --> 02:20:31,880
bro.
There's only one place for me to go.

3170
02:20:31,881 --> 02:20:33,620
And that's Colorado.
Yeah,

3171
02:20:33,680 --> 02:20:35,500
that's it.
But I felt like I disrespected him.

3172
02:20:35,501 --> 02:20:38,010
Like I would have to disrespect to 
Colorado had done,

3173
02:20:38,030 --> 02:20:38,560
you know,
when you really.

3174
02:20:38,600 --> 02:20:43,600
Why?
because I fucked up there a long time 

3175
02:20:43,600 --> 02:20:43,600
ago,
man.

3176
02:20:43,600 --> 02:20:44,990
You're a different human now.
That don't mean nothing.

3177
02:20:44,991 --> 02:20:47,150
It's a.
That's a thing in Colorado.

3178
02:20:47,151 --> 02:20:49,090
It's large country.
That's like god's country,

3179
02:20:49,091 --> 02:20:50,750
bro.
When you driving in Colorado,

3180
02:20:50,780 --> 02:20:53,870
you're breeding that at you and fucking 
god's living room.

3181
02:20:53,871 --> 02:20:55,670
I don't know what the fuck did describe 
to me.

3182
02:20:55,671 --> 02:21:00,671
One of the things about boulder is just 
that you're at the base of those 

3183
02:21:00,671 --> 02:21:00,740
mountains and you use or you leave 
boulder,

3184
02:21:00,890 --> 02:21:02,360
you drive 10 minutes.

3185
02:21:02,540 --> 02:21:05,190
Welcome to the woods.
Like literally you are.

3186
02:21:05,200 --> 02:21:10,200
It's 10 minutes out of boulder.
You are in the woods and the beauty of 

3187
02:21:10,371 --> 02:21:14,330
that place is so hard.
It's so stunning that it affects people.

3188
02:21:14,630 --> 02:21:19,630
It affects people.
It's like living around the most insane 

3189
02:21:19,630 --> 02:21:19,760
artwork all the time.
I really do believe that.

3190
02:21:19,820 --> 02:21:21,950
I think that's one of the reasons why 
the people were so healthy there.

3191
02:21:22,190 --> 02:21:24,360
I think the view,
it's not just the,

3192
02:21:24,361 --> 02:21:25,640
the air is clean,
which it is,

3193
02:21:25,641 --> 02:21:28,040
but it's also like the view of those 
mountains like enriches you.

3194
02:21:28,670 --> 02:21:31,430
I really believe that.
I think there's something to places like

3195
02:21:31,431 --> 02:21:33,710
that,
especially because it's a college town,

3196
02:21:33,711 --> 02:21:36,260
so it was like intelligent people.
They're intelligent,

3197
02:21:36,261 --> 02:21:38,960
cool people at the base of a mountain,
this insane view.

3198
02:21:39,240 --> 02:21:42,290
Listen dog that's buying some land and 
let's do this.

3199
02:21:42,470 --> 02:21:47,470
Let's start a farm sort of fucking 
colony up there on my daughter to be 

3200
02:21:47,470 --> 02:21:47,470
raised there.

3201
02:21:47,470 --> 02:21:48,170
Why not?
Let's do it.

3202
02:21:48,171 --> 02:21:49,250
You want to go?
I want to go.

3203
02:21:49,270 --> 02:21:54,270
Collin wants to go snow.
Trying them before some the girl that's 

3204
02:21:54,270 --> 02:21:57,090
got nothing for you.
Brian canes and fucking pain.

3205
02:21:57,110 --> 02:22:02,110
All that shit kills you brian.
And box them up and birdcages from the 

3206
02:22:02,110 --> 02:22:02,110
mansion.
Ship them up southwest.

3207
02:22:02,110 --> 02:22:04,160
I want to shoot my.
You know what man?

3208
02:22:04,161 --> 02:22:07,640
That's how I redeemed myself by shooting
my special in denver and why not?

3209
02:22:07,960 --> 02:22:09,080
Listen,
we could do.

3210
02:22:09,530 --> 02:22:13,050
We could go back to back.
You know we say hello.

3211
02:22:13,080 --> 02:22:17,660
Those motherfuckers know back to back 
specials like will you do one week?

3212
02:22:17,710 --> 02:22:19,530
I do another the next week.
You know,

3213
02:22:19,720 --> 02:22:23,330
we'll do like two weeks in denver.
We could even fill the documentary.

3214
02:22:23,570 --> 02:22:28,570
Take two weeks in denver.
I'll open for you when you do your 

3215
02:22:28,570 --> 02:22:32,211
special.
You overwhelming what I do for you to 

3216
02:22:32,211 --> 02:22:32,211
bring me up on stage somewhere.

3217
02:22:32,211 --> 02:22:32,580
I'll do it.

3220
02:22:34,960 --> 02:22:37,080

up.

3221
02:22:37,081 --> 02:22:39,340
I'd be happy to this.

3224
02:22:44,881 --> 02:22:48,120
That was mcguire.
Every single thing that was houston.

3225
02:22:48,330 --> 02:22:50,430
Every single thing I've done since then.
You brought me up.

3226
02:22:51,060 --> 02:22:51,660
No.
Uh,

3227
02:22:51,690 --> 02:22:54,300
what's the next big ufc fighter?
Brazil.

3228
02:22:54,600 --> 02:22:56,200
Brazil?

3229
02:22:56,520 --> 02:22:57,450
Yeah.
That's um.

3230
02:22:57,540 --> 02:22:59,220
Well no,

3231
02:22:59,250 --> 02:23:00,960
demetrius johnson.
John moraga.

3232
02:23:01,020 --> 02:23:03,570
That's on fox.
That's coming up soon.

3233
02:23:04,410 --> 02:23:06,240
yeah.
The ufc has been going to Japan.

3234
02:23:06,241 --> 02:23:11,241
Dude,
but they do the fx or fuel shows there 

3235
02:23:11,241 --> 02:23:11,241
and I don't,
I haven't been doing those,

3236
02:23:11,241 --> 02:23:14,300
but I'm doing the first fox sports one.
That's a boston card.

3237
02:23:14,310 --> 02:23:16,770
I'm going to do that.
I'm going to be at the show,

3238
02:23:16,771 --> 02:23:17,900
but I'm not going to fight.

3239
02:23:17,910 --> 02:23:19,110
I'm going to be at the show though.
Yeah,

3240
02:23:19,111 --> 02:23:22,620
with two shows sold out.
Who show boom son sockets.

3241
02:23:22,790 --> 02:23:24,610
You got to get to Alaska,
joe the next day.

3242
02:23:24,650 --> 02:23:28,710
You gotta listen to me this this summer 
before the time is up.

3243
02:23:29,070 --> 02:23:31,830
Before it gets cold there.
Go go to anchorage.

3244
02:23:31,831 --> 02:23:33,360
Alaska did comedy.
I did.

3245
02:23:33,750 --> 02:23:38,750
Yeah.
I did some fucking bear tooth lodge or 

3246
02:23:38,750 --> 02:23:39,510
something like that.
Wasn't the name of the then bear tooth.

3247
02:23:39,720 --> 02:23:41,430
I think it was.
Bear to bear to theater.

3248
02:23:41,730 --> 02:23:46,730
It's a theater.
They show movies there and then they 

3249
02:23:46,730 --> 02:23:46,730
have a comedy show.
It was flooded.

3250
02:23:47,310 --> 02:23:48,570
We went to anchorage.
Anchorage.

3251
02:23:48,600 --> 02:23:50,010
Okay.
You didn't go to chuck with charlie's?

3252
02:23:50,011 --> 02:23:51,450
no,
no.

3253
02:23:51,480 --> 02:23:54,060
I went to this bear to theater.
Wherever the fuck it is.

3254
02:23:54,090 --> 02:23:55,890
It was amazing.
They grow,

3255
02:23:56,100 --> 02:23:57,810
they grow.
They have their own beer there.

3256
02:23:57,930 --> 02:24:00,960
They grow their own pattern,
not powder.

3257
02:24:00,961 --> 02:24:02,280
It's like they brew their own beer.

3258
02:24:03,390 --> 02:24:05,820
It's amazing.
Make sure I'm saying the name right.

3259
02:24:05,821 --> 02:24:09,630
Bear to fudge is it?
YeaH.

3260
02:24:10,770 --> 02:24:11,520
Yeah.
It was amazing,

3261
02:24:11,521 --> 02:24:12,480
man.
It was a.

3262
02:24:12,840 --> 02:24:13,980
It was.
It's.

3263
02:24:14,040 --> 02:24:18,450
It's one of those places where as you're
up there like you would think before you

3264
02:24:18,451 --> 02:24:19,410
went there,
you'd be like,

3265
02:24:19,411 --> 02:24:23,160
who the fuck would live in Alaska?
Like my friend eric,

3266
02:24:23,220 --> 02:24:25,200
eric,
chris sugartree cues,

3267
02:24:25,530 --> 02:24:27,640
he used to live in Alaska.
There's a queue.

3268
02:24:27,700 --> 02:24:30,840
Makerbot ask you mager makes pool cues 
like the best pool cues.

3269
02:24:31,140 --> 02:24:32,220
And uh,
he was,

3270
02:24:32,430 --> 02:24:36,000
he at one point in time he did a,
he was working,

3271
02:24:36,001 --> 02:24:41,001
I think he lived at a base there when he
was in the military or lived there when 

3272
02:24:41,001 --> 02:24:42,270
he was in the military and he always 
talks about going back there and I go,

3273
02:24:42,271 --> 02:24:45,180
why the fuck would you go to Alaska?
Man,

3274
02:24:45,181 --> 02:24:50,181
are you crazy?
I was thinking about how cold it is and 

3275
02:24:50,181 --> 02:24:50,181
all the stories that I've heard.

3276
02:24:50,181 --> 02:24:51,480
But then you get there and you're like,
I see it,

3277
02:24:51,570 --> 02:24:56,570
I get it.
I've been the same thing happened to me 

3278
02:24:56,570 --> 02:24:56,570
once.
I got it.

3279
02:24:56,570 --> 02:24:56,570
I get it.
It's weird.

3280
02:24:56,570 --> 02:24:59,520
We go outside to third in the morning.
It's blight out at 2:30

3281
02:24:59,521 --> 02:25:00,130
in the morning.
We,

3282
02:25:00,131 --> 02:25:01,410
we,
we did our show.

3283
02:25:01,530 --> 02:25:03,570
We took pictures after the show we hung 
out.

3284
02:25:03,630 --> 02:25:06,180
I would just want to go party all night.
oh yeah.

3285
02:25:06,181 --> 02:25:07,710
I'm sure people do.
And by the way,

3286
02:25:07,711 --> 02:25:10,680
that myth of know pretty girls there.
Myth,

3287
02:25:11,280 --> 02:25:16,280
the myth of 10 to one men myth,
it's more than half of the population of

3288
02:25:16,381 --> 02:25:19,710
anchorage's girls and there.
There's a lot of hot ones.

3289
02:25:19,711 --> 02:25:21,840
I'm.
THey're like rugged hot.

3290
02:25:21,940 --> 02:25:24,100
what we can.
The bruise

3291
02:25:24,100 --> 02:25:26,200
up strip club.
I don't know.

3292
02:25:26,300 --> 02:25:27,670
I don't know.
We didn't go to the strip clubs.

3293
02:25:27,671 --> 02:25:28,530
You hear about it?
No,

3294
02:25:28,540 --> 02:25:28,970
we,
we,

3295
02:25:29,010 --> 02:25:31,120
we did basically was.
We fished all day.

3296
02:25:31,121 --> 02:25:32,570
We're efficient.
We got up,

3297
02:25:32,620 --> 02:25:37,620
we went on a,
we rented an outfitter and went for 10 

3298
02:25:37,620 --> 02:25:40,531
hours at a stretch.
So we did two long days and the first 

3299
02:25:40,531 --> 02:25:44,491
day we did 10 hours.
The second day we actually called it 

3300
02:25:44,491 --> 02:25:44,491
quits,
like a little early so that we could get

3301
02:25:44,491 --> 02:25:45,970
ready for the show because we were 
exhausted.

3302
02:25:46,200 --> 02:25:47,640
I'm not saying you went to the strip 
close,

3303
02:25:47,650 --> 02:25:52,650
but we didn't do any of that.
People were saYing you got to go to 

3304
02:25:52,650 --> 02:25:55,840
anywhere we go.
and this strip club there was huge 

3305
02:25:55,840 --> 02:25:58,140
because women come from all over the 
middle and early.

3306
02:25:58,150 --> 02:26:03,150
Two tHousands that there's a ratio of 10
to one men to women go up there and the 

3307
02:26:03,550 --> 02:26:08,550
dav,
a seasoned efficiencies and they'd make 

3308
02:26:08,550 --> 02:26:08,840
a fucking thousand shaking.

3309
02:26:09,340 --> 02:26:14,340
Yeah,
there's another season in late july and 

3310
02:26:14,340 --> 02:26:15,400
the silver salmon are running like,
uh,

3311
02:26:15,730 --> 02:26:16,540
towards,
uh,

3312
02:26:16,570 --> 02:26:18,130
towards the end of the month.
apparently.

3313
02:26:18,131 --> 02:26:20,020
That's another big time when people come
up.

3314
02:26:20,410 --> 02:26:23,530
And then it's also people would come up 
for the various hunting seasons.

3315
02:26:23,531 --> 02:26:26,380
Like moose season starts in september.
People come up for that.

3316
02:26:26,381 --> 02:26:30,820
But god damn that places majestic.
You see eagles,

3317
02:26:31,000 --> 02:26:36,000
you just see eagles everywhere.
We saw five moose were there for two 

3318
02:26:36,000 --> 02:26:36,000
days.
We saw five loose.

3319
02:26:36,000 --> 02:26:37,000
And there's just something about the 
place.

3320
02:26:37,240 --> 02:26:39,610
It just makes you humble,
you know,

3321
02:26:39,611 --> 02:26:41,620
it makes you,
it humbles you because it's just,

3322
02:26:41,621 --> 02:26:43,870
it's when you're flying over,
you look down,

3323
02:26:43,871 --> 02:26:47,800
your jaw just drops because it goes on 
for ever.

3324
02:26:47,801 --> 02:26:52,801
And Then forever you see nothing.
You just see mountains and trees and 

3325
02:26:52,801 --> 02:26:54,070
mountains and trees and mountains and 
trees and mountains and trees.

3326
02:26:54,220 --> 02:26:54,970
And then,
okay,

3327
02:26:54,971 --> 02:26:57,430
we're starting our descendant to aspen 
or to anchorage.

3328
02:26:57,610 --> 02:27:00,160
And he slowly start scooting into 
anchorage.

3329
02:27:00,400 --> 02:27:02,080
And by you get there,
when you get there,

3330
02:27:02,081 --> 02:27:04,780
you're like,
these people are gangster as fuck.

3331
02:27:05,050 --> 02:27:07,960
Like you think about how far their 
living from the real world.

3332
02:27:08,320 --> 02:27:13,320
Like they're up there on some weird 
little patch of land that they've 

3333
02:27:13,320 --> 02:27:16,651
assigned to clear out some trees and 
start some fires and a fucking half a 

3334
02:27:16,991 --> 02:27:19,480
million of them up there.
It was like 300,000

3335
02:27:19,481 --> 02:27:24,481
people live in there and it's only like,
I think the whole state only has like 

3336
02:27:24,481 --> 02:27:25,570
double that or something like that.
I think it's only like 600,000

3337
02:27:25,571 --> 02:27:28,450
people in the whole state,
but anchors got like 300,000

3338
02:27:28,451 --> 02:27:30,520
people you could live there,
man.

3339
02:27:30,580 --> 02:27:33,340
I'm telling that four hours away before 
we even start the party.

3340
02:27:33,510 --> 02:27:35,830
Yeah.
We'll get to seattle,

3341
02:27:35,900 --> 02:27:39,480
to Alaska and get to seattle from Alaska
and to.

3342
02:27:39,550 --> 02:27:44,550
That's great.
What am I gonna eat salmon the rest of 

3343
02:27:44,550 --> 02:27:44,550
my life.

3344
02:27:44,550 --> 02:27:44,740
You know what I'm saying?
How to get the other places.

3345
02:27:44,760 --> 02:27:47,620
If you could live anywhere outside of 
la.

3346
02:27:47,650 --> 02:27:49,400
Now I know now that you have your little
daughter,

3347
02:27:49,401 --> 02:27:50,620
you.
I'm sure you're probably thinking,

3348
02:27:50,621 --> 02:27:52,750
I don't want her growing up in 
California.

3349
02:27:52,780 --> 02:27:57,780
That's one of the things that I thought 
of immediately when my first daughter 

3350
02:27:57,780 --> 02:27:58,420
was born on diego.
So beautiful to goes to Mexico sun.

3351
02:27:58,990 --> 02:28:02,410
If you could go to another state,
whIch one would it be?

3352
02:28:02,560 --> 02:28:04,000
Colorado.
It would be Colorado.

3353
02:28:04,840 --> 02:28:06,310
Why not?
Yeah.

3354
02:28:06,340 --> 02:28:08,320
I can't figure out.
What about seattle would you do that?

3355
02:28:08,321 --> 02:28:13,321
If you get home,
I'll come fucking living in seattle from

3356
02:28:13,331 --> 02:28:16,480
september to december to credit to 
doctor.

3357
02:28:16,690 --> 02:28:19,300
I love these people are like cool.
Yeah.

3358
02:28:19,430 --> 02:28:20,340
So yeah.
Cool.

3359
02:28:20,620 --> 02:28:22,040
go up there in september and with

3360
02:28:22,040 --> 02:28:26,360
uc two fucking weeks of nonstop bucket 
of rain and the gutters and you can't go

3361
02:28:26,361 --> 02:28:27,860
nowhere and all you want to do is wake 
up,

3362
02:28:27,980 --> 02:28:29,600
look around.
You know when you wake up here,

3363
02:28:29,720 --> 02:28:32,390
you got to pee in the sun,
creeping through your windows.

3364
02:28:32,570 --> 02:28:37,570
What do you do when you wake up for two 
weeks and it fucking gray and then 

3365
02:28:37,570 --> 02:28:38,690
there's grant in november and it gets a 
little sunny for three days.

3366
02:28:38,840 --> 02:28:40,530
Then it's rainy again for three weeks 
ago.

3367
02:28:41,090 --> 02:28:42,020
Relaxed,
right?

3368
02:28:42,380 --> 02:28:44,650
Everybody wants to know danger.
Everybody wants to be a fuck up.

3369
02:28:44,670 --> 02:28:49,670
It's already in there for two days and 
all of sudden we got the place packed 

3370
02:28:49,670 --> 02:28:50,270
down,
lived there for six fucking months.

3371
02:28:50,360 --> 02:28:52,030
Seattle is great and the people are 
great.

3372
02:28:52,050 --> 02:28:57,050
It's great to do comedy there.
It wasn't for fucking me that long 

3373
02:28:57,050 --> 02:28:59,360
stretch from september to december.
It rain or build up and fuck you.

3374
02:28:59,630 --> 02:29:02,600
There's more to life than fucking waking
up the fucking rain,

3375
02:29:02,601 --> 02:29:04,400
my friend.
It's like living in buffalo,

3376
02:29:04,401 --> 02:29:06,020
New York.
What the fuck?

3377
02:29:06,021 --> 02:29:07,280
What are you.
What is that called?

3378
02:29:07,300 --> 02:29:09,720
The protractor where you put the 
protractor,

3379
02:29:09,740 --> 02:29:12,680
the buffalo and put the protractor.
The fucking seattle.

3380
02:29:12,860 --> 02:29:15,100
It's in the same missile,
the same missile.

3381
02:29:15,180 --> 02:29:18,020
Take our buffalo and then shooting.
Taken out fucking seattle.

3382
02:29:18,400 --> 02:29:22,910
They got the saMe suicide fucking rates.
You know you go to fucking buffalo dog.

3383
02:29:23,570 --> 02:29:25,390
It's a tough lift.
I love it.

3384
02:29:25,520 --> 02:29:26,990
I love it,
but there's a tough lift.

3385
02:29:27,080 --> 02:29:29,870
I think it's hard to fuck around with 
California in july and go,

3386
02:29:29,871 --> 02:29:34,871
yeah,
it's nice shadows who are just in the 

3387
02:29:34,871 --> 02:29:34,871
suMmer.
The only problem with counseling wAs too

3388
02:29:34,871 --> 02:29:39,400
many people.
That's the only problem that I think 

3389
02:29:39,400 --> 02:29:40,460
that if you got to add,
that might be the move to santa barbara,

3390
02:29:40,461 --> 02:29:43,790
might be the move someone needs to do a 
helium and santa barbara.

3391
02:29:44,000 --> 02:29:47,000
Do you know how bad asset would be?
That theater that we did was perfect.

3392
02:29:47,001 --> 02:29:48,500
We don't need to know.
Helium is in santa barbara.

3393
02:29:48,680 --> 02:29:52,790
That data we did for 600 seat again.
Which fucking gorgeous.

3394
02:29:53,080 --> 02:29:55,250
When I do it again,
say the word december,

3395
02:29:55,280 --> 02:29:59,090
december the week before christmas.
I love it.

3396
02:29:59,260 --> 02:30:01,550
That's because we still got to do with 
doing vegas.

3397
02:30:02,240 --> 02:30:04,370
Vegas.
December 27th.

3398
02:30:04,371 --> 02:30:09,371
We can't we,
but we still got to do an end of the 

3399
02:30:09,371 --> 02:30:09,371
world somewhere.
Real english.

3400
02:30:09,371 --> 02:30:10,760
They offered us the wilbur theater 
again.

3401
02:30:10,820 --> 02:30:12,890
Do it boston.
No,

3402
02:30:12,891 --> 02:30:15,310
here.
But we have to and rather than doing the

3403
02:30:15,320 --> 02:30:17,060
wilbur,
we have to do the wheelchair and the day

3404
02:30:17,061 --> 02:30:22,061
before christmas.
That's the end of the world with the 

3405
02:30:22,061 --> 02:30:22,061
23rd.
Yeah.

3406
02:30:22,061 --> 02:30:25,440
Yeah.
Because once a nobody wants to go out 

3407
02:30:25,440 --> 02:30:25,440
and christmas eve.
No,

3408
02:30:25,440 --> 02:30:28,660
two days before christmas shopping and 
shit.

3409
02:30:28,730 --> 02:30:33,730
December 20th.
But last time we did it December 21st 

3410
02:30:33,730 --> 02:30:33,730
December 21st.

3411
02:30:33,740 --> 02:30:35,150
You sit here at halloween.
All right.

3412
02:30:35,151 --> 02:30:37,500
What should we call it if we don't call 
it what she brings?

3413
02:30:37,580 --> 02:30:38,270
Stan.
Hope and honey.

3414
02:30:38,290 --> 02:30:38,670
Honey.
Again,

3415
02:30:38,780 --> 02:30:43,780
happy everybody.
Which we call it something in the world.

3416
02:30:43,880 --> 02:30:46,220
You ended the world part two.
The beginning of the new world.

3417
02:30:46,230 --> 02:30:48,980
Beginning of the new riders of the 
purple sage.

3418
02:30:49,220 --> 02:30:51,830
Do it in denver.
I'll do whatever the fuck you want.

3419
02:30:52,180 --> 02:30:53,600
If you want,
we should do it.

3420
02:30:53,601 --> 02:30:54,920
Let's move to denver.
Bitch.

3421
02:30:55,250 --> 02:30:57,080
Let's do that.
It still.

3422
02:30:57,081 --> 02:31:00,170
Let's move to denver,
but show how about a ball to show.

3423
02:31:00,380 --> 02:31:01,940
Do less.
Let's move to boulder bench.

3424
02:31:01,941 --> 02:31:06,941
Let's do it to do a definitely a monthly
show in vegas like every month you guys 

3425
02:31:08,181 --> 02:31:10,190
should do.
I don't know about that,

3426
02:31:10,191 --> 02:31:10,780
man.
I am.

3427
02:31:10,850 --> 02:31:13,310
I enjoy going in every few months and 
rocking it.

3428
02:31:13,550 --> 02:31:17,240
I'll tell you the joint as my new 
favorite place to join at the hard rock.

3429
02:31:17,390 --> 02:31:18,260
First of all,
everybody works.

3430
02:31:18,261 --> 02:31:20,030
There was cool as fuck as fuck.
It's

3431
02:31:20,040 --> 02:31:21,030
so.
It was dynamite.

3432
02:31:21,450 --> 02:31:22,860
Dynamite.
Great vibe.

3433
02:31:22,861 --> 02:31:24,720
And deck.
Tech crowd could have been better.

3434
02:31:24,721 --> 02:31:26,040
Joey diaz.
Amazing.

3435
02:31:26,070 --> 02:31:27,390
We had so much fun.
Okay,

3436
02:31:27,750 --> 02:31:30,850
so much fun with that was they weren't 
stoners.

3437
02:31:31,000 --> 02:31:33,130
We just hung out at the bar.
We didn't go out to smoke one time.

3438
02:31:33,131 --> 02:31:35,710
I didn't go out to smoke at all.
I was fucking stolen.

3439
02:31:35,711 --> 02:31:40,711
That edible.
I was just talking with the players on 

3440
02:31:40,711 --> 02:31:43,390
the planet fucked up at 9:30
by four.

3441
02:31:43,391 --> 02:31:47,040
I was fucked up in that whole total 
three gummies before I went on stage.

3442
02:31:47,290 --> 02:31:52,290
Can we bear?
I've been celebrate and then I would 

3443
02:31:52,481 --> 02:31:54,130
love to go to seattle on a regular 
basis.

3444
02:31:54,131 --> 02:31:56,170
I wish I can get you in and all that 
shit,

3445
02:31:56,171 --> 02:32:01,171
but I can't risk going to jail for 
something that happened eight fucking 

3446
02:32:01,171 --> 02:32:02,500
years ago that nobody.
Nothing bad happened.

3447
02:32:02,501 --> 02:32:02,880
Nothing.
Yeah.

3448
02:32:03,010 --> 02:32:06,580
That seems to go to fucking.
I didn't go to anger management.

3449
02:32:06,970 --> 02:32:09,640
The judge threw me out of the fucking 
state for two years.

3450
02:32:10,630 --> 02:32:11,380
Really?
Me.

3451
02:32:11,440 --> 02:32:15,160
The judge told me I got to go.
That's how it was and that was it.

3452
02:32:15,950 --> 02:32:16,990
You gotta go,
dog.

3453
02:32:17,530 --> 02:32:18,850
Go joe.
You got to go.

3454
02:32:18,930 --> 02:32:20,160
What are you doing next weekend?
Joe?

3455
02:32:20,820 --> 02:32:21,900
Are you.
Are you out of town?

3456
02:32:22,110 --> 02:32:23,610
Yes.
Yeah,

3457
02:32:23,611 --> 02:32:26,730
I got family shit going on.
Um,

3458
02:32:26,731 --> 02:32:31,731
I don't have a gig booked until the end 
gig booked out of town at least until 

3459
02:32:32,161 --> 02:32:34,650
seattle,
but I got some other shit cooking.

3460
02:32:34,800 --> 02:32:37,530
I'm trying to finish up this tv show 
till when it's,

3461
02:32:37,870 --> 02:32:42,870
it's,
it's more difficult than I thought it 

3462
02:32:42,870 --> 02:32:44,601
was going to be.
It's more difficult time wise and the 

3463
02:32:44,601 --> 02:32:47,031
thought I was going to be and it's more 
difficult as far as like getting it 

3464
02:32:47,031 --> 02:32:47,031
right.
It's a lot of work,

3465
02:32:47,031 --> 02:32:51,300
you know,
we're putting together kind of a crazy 

3466
02:32:51,300 --> 02:32:52,761
show,
but ari's in it and duncan's in it too 

3467
02:32:52,761 --> 02:32:52,830
and there's a lot of interviews that 
they're doing when I'm not there,

3468
02:32:53,010 --> 02:32:58,010
like I said,
dunkin to interview some scientists and 

3469
02:32:58,010 --> 02:33:00,471
are,
he goes and interviews from other 

3470
02:33:00,471 --> 02:33:02,031
scientists and all these other crazy 
people involved in all these different 

3471
02:33:02,031 --> 02:33:02,031
disciplines.

3472
02:33:02,031 --> 02:33:04,040
So it's kind of interesting and it's a 
way.

3473
02:33:04,200 --> 02:33:05,910
We're only hoping it coMes out.
Right.

3474
02:33:06,200 --> 02:33:07,440
It's a big experiMent,
right.

3475
02:33:07,441 --> 02:33:09,350
BecAuse he ran with a scientist.
So,

3476
02:33:09,590 --> 02:33:13,290
you know,
he's very intelligent man.

3477
02:33:13,320 --> 02:33:14,660
He's very good at,
uh,

3478
02:33:14,700 --> 02:33:19,700
at,
at interviewing people and talking to 

3479
02:33:19,700 --> 02:33:19,700
the people.
We had them talk to some,

3480
02:33:19,700 --> 02:33:22,611
uh,
some crazy religious guy and we went to 

3481
02:33:22,611 --> 02:33:24,000
the global future 2045 conference in New
York.

3482
02:33:24,300 --> 02:33:27,550
What a bunch of fucking intelligent 
super freaks.

3483
02:33:27,610 --> 02:33:30,210
That place was filled with.
It was so fascinating.

3484
02:33:30,220 --> 02:33:35,220
All these people with robots that look 
just like them and there were people 

3485
02:33:35,220 --> 02:33:35,660
with bionic hands and like the,
the,

3486
02:33:35,661 --> 02:33:38,730
the cutting edge of life extension 
science.

3487
02:33:38,940 --> 02:33:41,190
And we had already interviewing some 
religious guy.

3488
02:33:41,220 --> 02:33:46,220
It was really weird.
There was these religious guys and they 

3489
02:33:46,220 --> 02:33:46,220
were all like telling people that,
you know,

3490
02:33:46,260 --> 02:33:48,150
not to,
not to concentrate on,

3491
02:33:48,360 --> 02:33:51,750
on technology and not to be persuaded by
technology,

3492
02:33:51,751 --> 02:33:56,751
but the beauty of a rose cannot be 
defined by science who should know why a

3493
02:33:57,151 --> 02:34:02,151
seed becomes a flower and that flower 
becomes a beautiful part of it was like 

3494
02:34:02,731 --> 02:34:05,960
this weird resistance sort of,
you know,

3495
02:34:05,961 --> 02:34:09,600
and like this weird trying to 
incorporate their religion into the idea

3496
02:34:09,601 --> 02:34:10,320
of the future.

3497
02:34:10,590 --> 02:34:11,490
And you're like,
listen bitch,

3498
02:34:11,491 --> 02:34:16,491
she can't left behind getting left by.
You're dressed like a wizard and you're 

3499
02:34:16,491 --> 02:34:17,290
getting left behind.
No mattEr what you do.

3500
02:34:17,530 --> 02:34:22,530
He got crazy beads around your neck and 
you think they're important and you're 

3501
02:34:22,530 --> 02:34:22,530
fucked.
Okay.

3502
02:34:22,530 --> 02:34:24,760
Because your style of living,
you can't rock it.

3503
02:34:24,970 --> 02:34:29,970
You can't be reading 6,000
year old books and saying and saying 

3504
02:34:29,970 --> 02:34:31,360
they had it right.
They were onto it.

3505
02:34:31,390 --> 02:34:35,200
These global future 20,
45 people with microchips in their head.

3506
02:34:35,201 --> 02:34:36,370
They don't know what the fuck they're 
doing.

3507
02:34:37,790 --> 02:34:39,340
Joe ideas.
I lost ya.

3508
02:34:39,820 --> 02:34:40,430
Gotta.
Get outta here.

3509
02:34:40,710 --> 02:34:45,710
