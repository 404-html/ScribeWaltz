1
00:00:05,410 --> 00:00:06,243
Yeah.

2
00:00:06,510 --> 00:00:08,010
Hey everybody,

3
00:00:08,810 --> 00:00:12,420
this episode of the Joe Rogan experience
podcast is brought to you by Lumosity.

4
00:00:12,750 --> 00:00:17,750
Lumosity is essentially a one stop online
gym for your brain and a what it is.

5
00:00:19,321 --> 00:00:22,140
It's all based on the
science of neuroplasticity.

6
00:00:22,141 --> 00:00:27,141
And what they do is they create a program
for your specific goals to try to get

7
00:00:27,151 --> 00:00:28,380
your dome working better.

8
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:31,950
It only makes sense to me that the
human brain works just like pretty much

9
00:00:31,951 --> 00:00:33,270
everything else in the human body,

10
00:00:33,271 --> 00:00:34,650
like the lungs and like,

11
00:00:35,010 --> 00:00:35,843
like the,

12
00:00:36,260 --> 00:00:37,620
you know what the muscles,

13
00:00:38,190 --> 00:00:38,911
the more you use it,

14
00:00:38,911 --> 00:00:39,744
the better it works.

15
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:45,020
And Lumosity is designed through a
series of questions and a series of goals

16
00:00:46,111 --> 00:00:47,130
that you set up in advance.

17
00:00:47,131 --> 00:00:49,890
They cater each individual
program for you,

18
00:00:50,070 --> 00:00:52,200
designed to help you with
your specific functions,

19
00:00:52,201 --> 00:00:57,201
whether it's memory or whether it's
a tension or speed flexibility,

20
00:00:57,721 --> 00:01:00,120
communicating clearly
thinking outside the box.

21
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:01,740
They have all these different
parameters that you set.

22
00:01:01,741 --> 00:01:05,700
You set them in advance and then what
it creates is essentially like games.

23
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:09,870
They're fun games that you play
that can increase your memory,

24
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:10,290
uh,

25
00:01:10,290 --> 00:01:13,050
increase your capacity
to recall and recollect.

26
00:01:13,051 --> 00:01:13,500
Things.

27
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:15,660
I think those are both the same things
I just had to recall and recollect.

28
00:01:15,850 --> 00:01:16,131
All right,

29
00:01:16,131 --> 00:01:19,530
so this time one of them's
talking point is folks,

30
00:01:19,531 --> 00:01:21,030
it's fucking good for your brain.

31
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:23,940
And if you go to lumosity.com,

32
00:01:24,270 --> 00:01:25,890
forward slash Joe,

33
00:01:26,370 --> 00:01:27,090
uh,

34
00:01:27,090 --> 00:01:28,320
try and uh,

35
00:01:28,350 --> 00:01:29,850
you can go to the start page,

36
00:01:30,150 --> 00:01:31,290
start training button,

37
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:33,030
click that and then start
playing your first game.

38
00:01:33,031 --> 00:01:35,340
That's lumosity.com/joe.

39
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:35,800
Uh,

40
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:36,331
I use it,

41
00:01:36,331 --> 00:01:37,920
it's fondly of apps free iPhone,

42
00:01:37,921 --> 00:01:38,754
android,

43
00:01:39,070 --> 00:01:39,600
um,

44
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:40,770
probably even windows phones.

45
00:01:40,771 --> 00:01:41,820
They have apps in the windows phone.

46
00:01:41,821 --> 00:01:42,690
What do they call those things?

47
00:01:43,350 --> 00:01:44,183
They call them,

48
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:45,233
they call them apps.

49
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:49,260
So it's funny that somebody
didn't like patent apps,

50
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:49,711
you know,

51
00:01:49,711 --> 00:01:50,940
so you can't call them apps.

52
00:01:51,390 --> 00:01:52,770
Nobody saw the shit come at folks.

53
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:53,993
Um,

54
00:01:54,660 --> 00:01:55,380
they,

55
00:01:55,380 --> 00:01:55,771
they can,

56
00:01:55,771 --> 00:01:56,430
uh,

57
00:01:56,430 --> 00:01:57,151
they can also,

58
00:01:57,151 --> 00:01:57,870
um,

59
00:01:57,870 --> 00:02:01,320
set it up for you so you
could use it on a tablet,

60
00:02:01,650 --> 00:02:03,570
iPad and now anything you want,

61
00:02:03,571 --> 00:02:04,980

00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:07,631
It's easy.

90
00:03:07,631 --> 00:03:08,230
It's quick.

91
00:03:08,230 --> 00:03:09,040
It's easy.

92
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:09,280

Uh,

95
00:03:11,990 --> 00:03:13,600
I'm pretty sure Bert Kreischer uses it.

96
00:03:13,601 --> 00:03:15,280
I know Brian Red band uses it.

97
00:03:15,281 --> 00:03:19,240
It's an awesome way to send
things through the mail.

$110 bonus offer from a company that we

103

104
00:03:33,670 --> 00:03:36,450
We're also brought to you by
[inaudible] dot com that's o,

105
00:03:36,451 --> 00:03:38,190
n and I t.

106
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:38,830
Um,

107
00:03:38,830 --> 00:03:39,790
if you've seen all the,

108
00:03:39,791 --> 00:03:42,310
the recent hubbub about vitamins,

109
00:03:42,610 --> 00:03:43,421
there's been this,

110
00:03:43,421 --> 00:03:43,840
uh,

111
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:44,511
lately this,

112
00:03:44,511 --> 00:03:48,220
this big thing about
vitamins and about how,

113
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:48,640
uh,

114
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:50,020
vitamins are not good for you.

115
00:03:50,021 --> 00:03:53,470
There was some new study that said
that vitamins don't have any benefit.

116
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:55,270
That's the conclusion that,

117
00:03:55,271 --> 00:03:55,510
uh,

118
00:03:55,510 --> 00:03:58,900
people read when they
were talking about it.

119
00:03:59,830 --> 00:04:00,500
But that's,

120
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:01,870
that's not really what it said.

121
00:04:02,260 --> 00:04:06,220
What it really said is that vitamins
didn't work and some very specific cases,

122
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:10,840
like we're a old people were 65 years old.

123
00:04:10,841 --> 00:04:15,370
We're giving vitamins and it didn't help
in any significant way to prevent them

124
00:04:15,371 --> 00:04:16,204
from getting cancer.

125
00:04:16,210 --> 00:04:18,160
There's a few like very
specific parameters.

126
00:04:18,550 --> 00:04:22,810
A study shows that high dose multivitamins
have no effect on the progression of

127
00:04:22,811 --> 00:04:25,150
heart disease and heart attack survivors.

128
00:04:25,330 --> 00:04:27,850
And then the other one was a limited,

129
00:04:28,030 --> 00:04:31,750
limited evidence supports any benefit
from vitamin and mineral supplementation

130
00:04:31,751 --> 00:04:34,810
for the prevention of cancer
or cardiovascular disease.

131
00:04:35,230 --> 00:04:38,920
These are three very specific
things and on top of that,

132
00:04:38,921 --> 00:04:43,921
there's been a a mound of evidence and
a lot of it is listed at [inaudible] dot

133
00:04:44,021 --> 00:04:45,880
com forward slash blog.

134
00:04:46,210 --> 00:04:46,620
Um,

135
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:49,030
we list a infectious illness prevention,

136
00:04:49,031 --> 00:04:54,031
how they've been clinically
and statistically proven
to help prevent a lot of

137
00:04:55,301 --> 00:04:56,620
different issues that people have.

138
00:04:56,620 --> 00:04:58,630
There's a reason why they
give it to people with scurvy.

139
00:04:58,660 --> 00:04:58,931
Okay.

140
00:04:58,931 --> 00:05:01,420
They found out that scurvy is
caused by a lack of vitamin C.

141
00:05:01,630 --> 00:05:02,650
There's a reason why a,

142
00:05:02,651 --> 00:05:07,210
there was a couple recently that was
tried for murder because their child died

143
00:05:07,780 --> 00:05:10,570
because it didn't have enough be 12 and
the mother's milk because the family was

144
00:05:10,571 --> 00:05:10,981
Vegan,

145
00:05:10,981 --> 00:05:12,430
like so vitamins,

146
00:05:12,431 --> 00:05:12,641
look,

147
00:05:12,641 --> 00:05:13,690
vitamins are legit.

148
00:05:13,710 --> 00:05:14,920
There are a hundred percent legit.

149
00:05:15,390 --> 00:05:15,730
Um,

150
00:05:15,730 --> 00:05:16,260
they,

151
00:05:16,260 --> 00:05:18,160
it's how's your body absorbing them?

152
00:05:18,370 --> 00:05:20,410
The closer the vitamins are based to food,

153
00:05:20,411 --> 00:05:22,420
the more easy your body's
going to absorb them.

154
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:22,781
He bought,

155
00:05:22,781 --> 00:05:26,500
he's not supposed to be processing these
synthetic vitamins that are filled with

156
00:05:26,501 --> 00:05:29,350
toxic binders and they come
in this gelatinous capsule.

157
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:31,390
Your body doesn't know
what the fuck that is.

158
00:05:31,391 --> 00:05:32,800
It knows it's not a cheeseburger.

159
00:05:32,950 --> 00:05:34,150
It knows it's not a watermelon.

160
00:05:34,151 --> 00:05:34,990
It's something weird.

161
00:05:35,290 --> 00:05:38,800
And so your body pisses a lot
of it out at an add on it.

162
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:42,700
One of the things that we do is we don't
sell any of those synthetic vitamins.

163
00:05:42,701 --> 00:05:43,481
Everything we sell,

164
00:05:43,481 --> 00:05:44,320
it's food based.

165
00:05:44,620 --> 00:05:46,120
And that's all we ever recommend.

166
00:05:46,420 --> 00:05:51,420
I don't think that you should be taking
anything that is created in a lab.

167
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:54,940
If you can get the same thing
that it's extracted from food.

168
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:56,020
Um,

169
00:05:56,020 --> 00:05:57,530
there's an issue with some things.

170
00:05:57,531 --> 00:05:57,711
I mean,

171
00:05:57,711 --> 00:05:59,750
there's a reason why you take
multivitamins is first of all,

172
00:05:59,780 --> 00:06:02,690
most of us don't really
lead a balanced diet.

173
00:06:02,691 --> 00:06:04,700
So some form of supplementation.

174
00:06:04,701 --> 00:06:06,550
I prefer a green,

175
00:06:06,570 --> 00:06:11,240
a green supplements like Spirulina or um,

176
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:16,480
there's a lot of different live Greens
that you can buy in supermarkets and you

177
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:18,230
throw those things in.

178
00:06:18,231 --> 00:06:22,670
Blenders and all that stuff is the best
way to get your mind your vitamins from

179
00:06:22,730 --> 00:06:26,030
leafy green vegetables and fruits
and things along those lines.

180
00:06:26,031 --> 00:06:29,180
But it's not a bad thing to
supplement outside of that.

181
00:06:29,210 --> 00:06:30,620
Even with synthetic vitamins,

182
00:06:30,621 --> 00:06:31,850
it's better than nothing.

183
00:06:32,180 --> 00:06:35,510
It might not have statistically proven
effects on preventing heart disease and

184
00:06:35,511 --> 00:06:36,051
old people,

185
00:06:36,051 --> 00:06:39,500
but these are from some pretty specific
parameters that they're talking about.

186
00:06:39,501 --> 00:06:42,650
So I think that the say case close might,

187
00:06:42,710 --> 00:06:44,510
vitamins and minerals don't work,

188
00:06:44,511 --> 00:06:45,344
you're wasting their money.

189
00:06:45,710 --> 00:06:46,490
That stinks.

190
00:06:46,490 --> 00:06:48,800
It sounds like someone's just trying
to get a lot of attention for their,

191
00:06:48,980 --> 00:06:51,230
their study and it sounds like it's a,

192
00:06:51,231 --> 00:06:52,064
it's a really,

193
00:06:52,490 --> 00:06:54,380
not just an inaccurate conclusion,

194
00:06:54,620 --> 00:06:55,640
but it seems,

195
00:06:55,700 --> 00:06:57,500
it seems incompetent.

196
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:58,041
It's like a,

197
00:06:58,041 --> 00:06:59,330
it's an incompetent thing to say.

198
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:01,820
There's a reason why Vitamix
exists in the first place.

199
00:07:01,940 --> 00:07:03,350
They've been documented,

200
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:04,760
they figured out what they are.

201
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:05,713
They're not like,

202
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:06,830
it's not like a myth.

203
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:07,551
It's not like,

204
00:07:07,551 --> 00:07:09,050
well this element has no effect.

205
00:07:09,051 --> 00:07:11,000
Would that element does they
know exactly what they are?

206
00:07:11,030 --> 00:07:11,863
They extract them,

207
00:07:11,930 --> 00:07:12,890
they put them in pill form.

208
00:07:12,890 --> 00:07:15,650
It's just a matter of how much
of it is your body absorbing.

209
00:07:15,651 --> 00:07:17,150
All vitamins are not created equally.

210
00:07:17,540 --> 00:07:20,960
And you should look into all
the positive benefits of,

211
00:07:20,961 --> 00:07:23,180
of vitamins that we've documented.

212
00:07:23,670 --> 00:07:24,590
These are not our,

213
00:07:24,620 --> 00:07:25,550
not our studies.

214
00:07:25,790 --> 00:07:28,190
These are all peer reviewed and a pub,

215
00:07:28,191 --> 00:07:29,024
Med studies.

216
00:07:29,180 --> 00:07:29,840
And uh,

217
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:31,760
we've got five of them listed on a,

218
00:07:31,761 --> 00:07:34,850
on a.com on a.com including,

219
00:07:34,851 --> 00:07:35,060
uh,

220
00:07:35,060 --> 00:07:35,990
people talking about a,

221
00:07:35,991 --> 00:07:36,824
um,

222
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:37,261
uh,

223
00:07:37,261 --> 00:07:39,320
an improvement in cognition,

224
00:07:39,650 --> 00:07:40,820
release of some work,

225
00:07:40,821 --> 00:07:41,331
stress,

226
00:07:41,331 --> 00:07:41,781
mood,

227
00:07:41,781 --> 00:07:42,321
stress,

228
00:07:42,321 --> 00:07:43,580
infectious illness prevention,

229
00:07:43,610 --> 00:07:44,870
even juvenile delinquency.

230
00:07:45,290 --> 00:07:48,890
So it's not as cut and dry as we
would like you to think that said,

231
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:49,340
um,

232
00:07:49,340 --> 00:07:53,480
it's one of the reasons why on it
doesn't sell synthetic vitamins and,

233
00:07:53,540 --> 00:07:54,373
and you know,

234
00:07:54,410 --> 00:07:56,750
bound up capsules that are,

235
00:07:56,900 --> 00:07:59,480
a lot of times they find those
hard pills in the bottom of fucking

236
00:07:59,481 --> 00:08:01,490
port-a-potties cause people
shit right through them.

237
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:02,510
They don't even,

238
00:08:02,510 --> 00:08:05,240
they go through your body like
corn because your body's like,

239
00:08:05,241 --> 00:08:06,650
what does this rock you're eating?

240
00:08:07,070 --> 00:08:08,260
You're not supposed to eat a rock dummy.

241
00:08:08,261 --> 00:08:09,260
He switched he kale.

242
00:08:09,420 --> 00:08:09,681
All right,

243
00:08:09,681 --> 00:08:10,910
you're supposed to eat cucumbers,

244
00:08:11,150 --> 00:08:14,240
but if you don't have
any camera cucumbers,

245
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:15,650
that rock is better than nothing.

246
00:08:16,170 --> 00:08:17,060
Does what I'm trying to say.

247
00:08:17,550 --> 00:08:17,900
Anyway,

248
00:08:17,900 --> 00:08:18,160
ladies,

249
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:19,580
gentlemen on a.com it's o,

250
00:08:19,581 --> 00:08:24,581
n n I t used the code name Rogan and
save 10% off any and all supplements.

251
00:08:25,970 --> 00:08:26,271
Again,

252
00:08:26,271 --> 00:08:27,320
we don't have any multivitamins,

253
00:08:27,350 --> 00:08:31,790
but you should read this study and then
also read the [inaudible] dot com blog

254
00:08:31,791 --> 00:08:32,271
because,

255
00:08:32,271 --> 00:08:32,570
uh,

256
00:08:32,570 --> 00:08:33,041
it's,

257
00:08:33,041 --> 00:08:36,470
it's a pretty fascinating and it's pretty
fascinating how irresponsible it is to

258
00:08:36,471 --> 00:08:40,520
just say something doesn't work when
you're talking about three very specific

259
00:08:40,521 --> 00:08:42,920
examples where it didn't show
a statistical improvement.

260
00:08:43,510 --> 00:08:44,540
Uh,

261
00:08:44,980 --> 00:08:45,351
O n,

262
00:08:45,351 --> 00:08:47,300
n I t use code name rogue
and save yourself some money.

263
00:08:47,301 --> 00:08:49,010
Shane Smith and Eddie Wong are here.

264
00:08:49,190 --> 00:08:50,023
Keith music,

265
00:08:54,220 --> 00:08:56,130
the Joe Rogan experience,

266
00:08:57,180 --> 00:08:59,280
Joe Rogan podcast all day.

267
00:09:00,300 --> 00:09:03,880
I barely know enough about those words
that I said to put them in a sentence in.

268
00:09:03,881 --> 00:09:04,590
There it goes.

269
00:09:04,590 --> 00:09:06,360
That's how easy it is to get
on the Internet these days.

270
00:09:07,590 --> 00:09:09,180
All that shit that I would
say in about vitamins,

271
00:09:09,181 --> 00:09:10,014
man,

272
00:09:10,950 --> 00:09:11,880
I fucking vitamins.

273
00:09:11,940 --> 00:09:12,773
You fuck with them.

274
00:09:14,250 --> 00:09:16,230
I take great grape seed extract.

275
00:09:16,410 --> 00:09:16,860
Oh yeah.

276
00:09:16,860 --> 00:09:18,210
I take methyl assist.

277
00:09:18,270 --> 00:09:19,103
Do you really

278
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:22,720
love probiotic?

279
00:09:23,790 --> 00:09:26,850
We had spleens so that we could eat rocks.

280
00:09:28,570 --> 00:09:29,310
Rocks.

281
00:09:29,310 --> 00:09:30,300
Is that for eating rocks,

282
00:09:30,590 --> 00:09:33,450
bones really wigs things.

283
00:09:33,460 --> 00:09:35,820
Before I thought it was
just to get ruptured.

284
00:09:35,821 --> 00:09:36,750
When you play football,

285
00:09:36,780 --> 00:09:39,540
like a little airbag I
respect to due to eat rocks.

286
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:40,310
Yeah.

287
00:09:40,310 --> 00:09:43,280
Well we got lots of shifts
where we used to eat lotion,

288
00:09:43,290 --> 00:09:44,010
dirt.

289
00:09:44,010 --> 00:09:44,401
Oh yeah.

290
00:09:44,401 --> 00:09:47,280
Well it wasn't that one of
the rumors of the appendix.

291
00:09:47,490 --> 00:09:49,560
I'm not sure if that was ever
been proven or disproven,

292
00:09:49,561 --> 00:09:51,360
but the appendix a,

293
00:09:51,361 --> 00:09:53,700
it originally was an
Oregon for processing meat.

294
00:09:53,980 --> 00:09:54,301
I think.

295
00:09:54,301 --> 00:09:56,540
Then it was found to be more um,

296
00:09:56,590 --> 00:09:56,940
uh,

297
00:09:56,940 --> 00:10:01,490
fibrous vegetables that that was what
we had the issue until we made me.

298
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:03,360
You're saying appendix,

299
00:10:03,361 --> 00:10:04,290
I'm saying spleen,

300
00:10:04,291 --> 00:10:05,790
maybe it's something else altogether.

301
00:10:05,820 --> 00:10:06,930
Maybe we're not doctors.

302
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:09,690
We don't know what the
fuck we're talking about.

303
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:10,441
Dude.

304
00:10:10,441 --> 00:10:13,110
You can't be a renegade
journalist world traveler.

305
00:10:13,111 --> 00:10:13,944
And a doctor,

306
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:14,880
right.

307
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:16,110
There's not enough time in this world.

308
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:20,040
And Tell Him Eddie Times,

309
00:10:20,530 --> 00:10:21,271
Jay Shit together,

310
00:10:21,271 --> 00:10:22,104
son,

311
00:10:22,170 --> 00:10:25,230
you're back from a another
crazy vice world tour.

312
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:26,633
Where'd you go?

313
00:10:26,650 --> 00:10:27,483
Um,

314
00:10:28,630 --> 00:10:31,000
I went to a lot of places we
were shooting in Louisiana.

315
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:32,020
Uh,

316
00:10:32,020 --> 00:10:33,340
that doesn't sound very dangerous,

317
00:10:33,341 --> 00:10:35,980
but I've been in Louisiana
has a heavy story,

318
00:10:36,110 --> 00:10:37,270
Louisiana's pretty gangster.

319
00:10:37,330 --> 00:10:39,010
And then we went to Turkey,

320
00:10:39,011 --> 00:10:39,970
Syria,

321
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,850
Dagestan and Greenland,

322
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:44,410
and then Dublin.

323
00:10:44,860 --> 00:10:45,221
Whoa.

324
00:10:45,221 --> 00:10:46,420
What'd you do in Greenland?

325
00:10:47,230 --> 00:10:52,230
We were there with the Danish and
Greenland Meteorological Society as they

326
00:10:54,311 --> 00:10:59,120
measured how fast the ice sheets are
melting and there are melting fogging

327
00:10:59,140 --> 00:10:59,950
valve.

328
00:10:59,950 --> 00:11:00,783
Wow.

329
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:01,990
How fast.

330
00:11:02,020 --> 00:11:03,040
Very fast.

331
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:08,110
So the IPCC report just came
out and we are 60 years.

332
00:11:08,111 --> 00:11:10,030
So they do every five years.

333
00:11:10,031 --> 00:11:12,310
They do a report that sort of has a,

334
00:11:12,340 --> 00:11:12,790
uh,

335
00:11:12,790 --> 00:11:13,540
you know,

336
00:11:13,540 --> 00:11:13,950
uh,

337
00:11:13,950 --> 00:11:14,783
a spectrum of,

338
00:11:14,950 --> 00:11:15,221
you know,

339
00:11:15,221 --> 00:11:19,990
best case and worst case scenario and
the worst case scenario from five years

340
00:11:19,991 --> 00:11:20,141
ago,

341
00:11:20,141 --> 00:11:23,160
we're now 30 years ahead of wow.

342
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:23,990
Yeah.

343
00:11:23,990 --> 00:11:28,240
And so this year Greenland had
its first full surface melt,

344
00:11:28,241 --> 00:11:32,500
so all of the ice sheet
was melting and um,

345
00:11:33,460 --> 00:11:35,230
highest temperatures in recorded history,

346
00:11:35,231 --> 00:11:35,531
et Cetera,

347
00:11:35,531 --> 00:11:36,310
et cetera.

348
00:11:36,310 --> 00:11:37,870
And so what it,

349
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:42,010
Greenland itself holds 23
feet of sea level rise.

350
00:11:42,060 --> 00:11:43,240
So if it melts,

351
00:11:43,300 --> 00:11:44,290
all of it melts.

352
00:11:45,170 --> 00:11:46,100
Um,

353
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:48,200
there's 27 feet higher,

354
00:11:48,201 --> 00:11:49,460
so we're all going to be underwater.

355
00:11:49,970 --> 00:11:50,630
Everything.

356
00:11:50,630 --> 00:11:52,640
Like how deep would that take America?

357
00:11:53,380 --> 00:11:54,130
Well,

358
00:11:54,130 --> 00:11:54,820
so it would be,

359
00:11:54,820 --> 00:11:57,670
it would be where the water
is now 27 feet higher.

360
00:11:58,180 --> 00:12:01,480
So it would go like the big bear we go.

361
00:12:01,510 --> 00:12:01,870
Yeah.

362
00:12:01,870 --> 00:12:02,710
I mean it would go,

363
00:12:02,740 --> 00:12:03,430
it would go,

364
00:12:03,430 --> 00:12:04,810
I don't know how high we are up here,

365
00:12:04,811 --> 00:12:07,500
but we're probably somewhere on 20 feet
higher and see the lawyer should have

366
00:12:07,501 --> 00:12:11,410
been maybe so we would go out there
and there should be some ocean water.

367
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:11,621
Yeah.

368
00:12:11,621 --> 00:12:13,220
But like Shanghai New York,

369
00:12:14,020 --> 00:12:14,853
Calcutta,

370
00:12:14,860 --> 00:12:18,430
actually 80 of the hundred
biggest cities are at sea level.

371
00:12:18,610 --> 00:12:22,420
Was it you guys that did the piece
on Miami about how doomed Miami is?

372
00:12:23,110 --> 00:12:23,943
Maybe

373
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:29,050
did a piece with Jay to
Stevens about global warming?

374
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:29,320
Oh yeah,

375
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:29,860
yeah,

376
00:12:29,860 --> 00:12:30,693
yeah.

377
00:12:30,900 --> 00:12:31,733
No,

378
00:12:31,980 --> 00:12:33,580
we were just in the bank,

379
00:12:35,350 --> 00:12:38,020
but know that Greenland's shit
when I hear things like that,

380
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:42,190
and I remember I watched the
inconvenient truth high and I lit Ay Ay,

381
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:44,110
I pissed my pants and I was so,

382
00:12:44,111 --> 00:12:45,310
I had a nervous breakdown.

383
00:12:45,610 --> 00:12:48,400
That movie is so scary when
you're like eating edibles,

384
00:12:48,401 --> 00:12:51,850
but it's also the type of shit that
makes me feel like I don't want to have

385
00:12:51,851 --> 00:12:52,684
kids,

386
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:53,490
you know?

387
00:12:53,490 --> 00:12:53,780
Yeah.

388
00:12:53,780 --> 00:12:54,511
But you say that,

389
00:12:54,511 --> 00:12:55,390
but why are you,

390
00:12:55,420 --> 00:12:56,380
how are you right now?

391
00:12:56,381 --> 00:12:57,214
You okay?

392
00:12:57,570 --> 00:12:58,403
I'm okay.

393
00:12:58,740 --> 00:13:00,280
I think most people are okay.

394
00:13:00,490 --> 00:13:03,670
I think most people are going to remain
okay despite the problems of the world.

395
00:13:03,850 --> 00:13:06,370
I think we're going to figure out
a way for most people to remain.

396
00:13:06,371 --> 00:13:07,120
Okay.

397
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:07,841
The idea of,

398
00:13:07,841 --> 00:13:08,160
uh,

399
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:08,471
you know,

400
00:13:08,471 --> 00:13:09,550
bringing a kid into the world.

401
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:10,480
If you're alive,

402
00:13:10,481 --> 00:13:12,340
the kid could be alive
and when you're dead,

403
00:13:12,341 --> 00:13:13,480
the kids going to be dead too.

404
00:13:13,570 --> 00:13:14,440
Everyone's going to be dead.

405
00:13:14,590 --> 00:13:15,970
What if you lived in the Mel Deeves?

406
00:13:15,971 --> 00:13:16,870
Would you have kids?

407
00:13:16,871 --> 00:13:17,290
I mean,

408
00:13:17,290 --> 00:13:19,560
well that's shit ain't does
that doesn't even exist,

409
00:13:19,590 --> 00:13:19,960
right?

410
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:20,080
Yeah,

411
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:20,350
they're,

412
00:13:20,350 --> 00:13:20,681
they're,

413
00:13:20,681 --> 00:13:21,491
they're going away.

414
00:13:21,491 --> 00:13:23,590
But actually I did a piece there too,

415
00:13:23,591 --> 00:13:26,500
but a Greenland is interesting because,

416
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:27,370
you know,

417
00:13:27,370 --> 00:13:27,821
so anyway,

418
00:13:27,821 --> 00:13:28,571
we go to Greenland,

419
00:13:28,571 --> 00:13:29,261
we measured the ice,

420
00:13:29,261 --> 00:13:29,951
the ice is melting,

421
00:13:29,951 --> 00:13:30,784
it's very bad.

422
00:13:31,300 --> 00:13:32,200
Um,

423
00:13:32,410 --> 00:13:33,280
and then we sort of said,

424
00:13:33,281 --> 00:13:33,521
okay,

425
00:13:33,521 --> 00:13:34,180
let's get a,

426
00:13:34,180 --> 00:13:37,420
a consensus scientists like a scientist
who represents this sort of global

427
00:13:37,421 --> 00:13:39,220
consensus of scientific thought.

428
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:40,541
And we said,

429
00:13:40,541 --> 00:13:41,374
um,

430
00:13:42,030 --> 00:13:42,863
uh,

431
00:13:43,030 --> 00:13:43,863
what's happening?

432
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:44,933
You know,

433
00:13:45,070 --> 00:13:45,821
and he said,

434
00:13:45,821 --> 00:13:47,050
we have to cut admission.

435
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:48,190
This is a conservative dude.

436
00:13:48,191 --> 00:13:48,551
And he's like,

437
00:13:48,551 --> 00:13:50,380
we have to cut emissions by 80%.

438
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:52,810
And I said,

439
00:13:52,811 --> 00:13:53,021
okay,

440
00:13:53,021 --> 00:13:55,090
what if we don't cut
emissions by 80% then,

441
00:13:55,570 --> 00:13:56,021
you know,

442
00:13:56,021 --> 00:13:58,420
global warming will continue
and then the sea level rise,

443
00:13:58,421 --> 00:13:59,254
we're continuing to do.

444
00:13:59,770 --> 00:14:00,281
And then I said,

445
00:14:00,281 --> 00:14:00,640
well,

446
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:01,550
how much of it is manmade?

447
00:14:01,660 --> 00:14:02,493
100% okay?

448
00:14:02,860 --> 00:14:04,450
And so we can change it.

449
00:14:04,451 --> 00:14:04,961
So I,

450
00:14:04,961 --> 00:14:05,151
you're,

451
00:14:05,151 --> 00:14:05,710
you're right,

452
00:14:05,710 --> 00:14:05,950
Joe.

453
00:14:05,950 --> 00:14:06,281
We can,

454
00:14:06,281 --> 00:14:08,260
there's shit we can do
to change all this stuff.

455
00:14:08,950 --> 00:14:10,670
But what the interesting I said is,

456
00:14:11,110 --> 00:14:11,381
okay,

457
00:14:11,381 --> 00:14:11,910
so,

458
00:14:11,910 --> 00:14:13,300
so if we stop,

459
00:14:13,660 --> 00:14:14,140
you know,

460
00:14:14,140 --> 00:14:15,160
80% emissions,

461
00:14:15,670 --> 00:14:16,870
how long does it continue?

462
00:14:16,990 --> 00:14:17,380
And he goes,

463
00:14:17,380 --> 00:14:17,710
oh,

464
00:14:17,710 --> 00:14:18,850
hundreds and hundreds of years,

465
00:14:18,851 --> 00:14:19,900
probably a thousand years.

466
00:14:20,460 --> 00:14:20,771
And I'm like,

467
00:14:20,771 --> 00:14:24,610
so global warming continues for a
thousand years no matter what happens.

468
00:14:24,910 --> 00:14:25,330
And,

469
00:14:25,330 --> 00:14:25,660
and,

470
00:14:25,660 --> 00:14:26,660
and Greenland's going to Mulligan.

471
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:26,921
Oh yeah.

472
00:14:26,921 --> 00:14:27,820
Greenland's gonna melt.

473
00:14:27,970 --> 00:14:30,010
That's a given it just how fast.

474
00:14:30,310 --> 00:14:32,830
So we will have 27 or
24 or whatever it is,

475
00:14:32,831 --> 00:14:33,730
feet of sea level rise.

476
00:14:34,060 --> 00:14:34,540
It just,

477
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:35,710
is it going to be in a hundred years?

478
00:14:35,711 --> 00:14:36,610
Is it going to be 50 years?

479
00:14:36,611 --> 00:14:38,140
Is it going to be in 200 years?

480
00:14:38,141 --> 00:14:39,280
That's the only question now.

481
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:40,290
Wow.

482
00:14:40,290 --> 00:14:44,400
And so no one anticipated this
up until just a few decades ago.

483
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:48,750
We didn't even know if was fucking
sea level rise is so fucking crazy.

484
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:52,400
We just started burning shit and changing

485
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:54,830
the gasses that surround
the planet and be like,

486
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:55,873
dude,

487
00:14:56,210 --> 00:14:57,043
don't worry.

488
00:14:57,330 --> 00:14:58,910
What was the shocking thing is I'm like,

489
00:14:58,911 --> 00:14:59,744
how many?

490
00:14:59,810 --> 00:15:01,090
Like how you know,

491
00:15:01,220 --> 00:15:01,610
is it,

492
00:15:01,610 --> 00:15:01,970
is it,

493
00:15:01,970 --> 00:15:02,870
how much of his mammy?

494
00:15:02,871 --> 00:15:03,351
Cause I'm like,

495
00:15:03,351 --> 00:15:03,910
you know,

496
00:15:03,910 --> 00:15:07,070
you hear all this shit about why
it's a cyclical thing and it's fine.

497
00:15:07,071 --> 00:15:08,240
It's nature is always done this.

498
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:08,750
And he goes,

499
00:15:08,750 --> 00:15:08,881
no,

500
00:15:08,881 --> 00:15:08,981
no,

501
00:15:08,981 --> 00:15:09,671
it's 100% man.

502
00:15:09,671 --> 00:15:09,861
I mean,

503
00:15:09,861 --> 00:15:10,220
I'm like,

504
00:15:10,220 --> 00:15:10,491
yeah,

505
00:15:10,491 --> 00:15:11,181
but is that like,

506
00:15:11,181 --> 00:15:11,490
you know,

507
00:15:11,490 --> 00:15:12,323
and he goes,

508
00:15:12,380 --> 00:15:14,660
if you talk to any scientist,

509
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:15,980
a real scientist,

510
00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:17,330
uh,

511
00:15:17,330 --> 00:15:17,750
you know,

512
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:20,510
95% of the global scientists are like,

513
00:15:20,511 --> 00:15:21,740
this is why it's happening.

514
00:15:21,890 --> 00:15:22,191
And I'm like,

515
00:15:22,191 --> 00:15:22,261
well,

516
00:15:22,261 --> 00:15:23,091
what are the other 5%?

517
00:15:23,091 --> 00:15:23,330
He goes,

518
00:15:23,330 --> 00:15:25,340
they're paid by the fucking oil companies.

519
00:15:25,341 --> 00:15:26,960
So what the fuck do you
think they're going to say?

520
00:15:27,530 --> 00:15:28,340
So,

521
00:15:28,340 --> 00:15:29,151
and it's a given.

522
00:15:29,151 --> 00:15:29,511
And I'm like,

523
00:15:29,511 --> 00:15:32,630
why the fuck don't more people know this?

524
00:15:32,631 --> 00:15:34,040
That's one thing that I don't understand.

525
00:15:34,460 --> 00:15:36,920
And we also did this thing
on the drought in Texas on a,

526
00:15:36,950 --> 00:15:37,790
on another story.

527
00:15:38,270 --> 00:15:39,140
And everybody's like,

528
00:15:39,170 --> 00:15:39,551
we asked,

529
00:15:39,551 --> 00:15:40,580
do you believe in global warming?

530
00:15:40,610 --> 00:15:41,091
And by the way,

531
00:15:41,091 --> 00:15:42,080
all the cows are dead,

532
00:15:42,081 --> 00:15:42,561
the fucking,

533
00:15:42,561 --> 00:15:43,250
you know,

534
00:15:43,250 --> 00:15:43,670
and,

535
00:15:43,670 --> 00:15:44,080
and,

536
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:44,441
and,

537
00:15:44,441 --> 00:15:44,890
and,

538
00:15:44,890 --> 00:15:45,411
and they're like,

539
00:15:45,411 --> 00:15:45,800
Nah,

540
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:46,730
that's been disproved.

541
00:15:46,731 --> 00:15:47,541
That's been disproved.

542
00:15:47,541 --> 00:15:48,260
And you're like,

543
00:15:48,260 --> 00:15:48,450
bye.

544
00:15:48,450 --> 00:15:49,283
Who?

545
00:15:49,610 --> 00:15:50,443
Jesus.

546
00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:51,473
Jesus.

547
00:15:51,630 --> 00:15:51,970
Yeah.

548
00:15:51,970 --> 00:15:52,200
No,

549
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:53,740
just people just pay the lie.

550
00:15:53,741 --> 00:15:57,610
Like we did a fresh off the boat episode
in North Dakota and we were trying to

551
00:15:57,611 --> 00:16:01,270
do stories on fracking and we stayed at
a man camp and this was one of the most

552
00:16:01,271 --> 00:16:02,710
bugged out things I ever did.

553
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:07,570
I stated a man camp for two nights and
all the strip clubs in the area had been

554
00:16:07,571 --> 00:16:12,571
shut down by the police cause they had
like 150 incidents of violence in these

555
00:16:12,711 --> 00:16:17,711
strip clubs because these dudes are out
there by themselves working like 1618

556
00:16:18,491 --> 00:16:21,100
hour shifts and they don't see any women.

557
00:16:21,220 --> 00:16:23,230
So all there is is fracking sites,

558
00:16:23,260 --> 00:16:28,260
man camps and strip clubs and a
Walmart Rove to these frack sites.

559
00:16:28,721 --> 00:16:32,800
And we're shooting there and we're
trying to talk to people and everyone was

560
00:16:32,801 --> 00:16:33,551
super friendly,

561
00:16:33,551 --> 00:16:33,880
right?

562
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:36,520
Everyone wanted to talk
to us to divert us.

563
00:16:36,850 --> 00:16:38,270
We would be on a fracking site of like,

564
00:16:38,290 --> 00:16:38,501
look,

565
00:16:38,501 --> 00:16:40,060
let me show you another
site that's better.

566
00:16:40,060 --> 00:16:40,893
Let me show you.

567
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:43,270
And they drive us like 10 miles away,

568
00:16:43,510 --> 00:16:44,500
30 minutes out,

569
00:16:44,830 --> 00:16:46,540
and then they'd stop the truck,

570
00:16:46,541 --> 00:16:47,760
pull over on the side
of the road and be like,

571
00:16:47,830 --> 00:16:48,071
Oh,

572
00:16:48,071 --> 00:16:49,840
you know that that side
I was going to show you.

573
00:16:49,870 --> 00:16:50,930
It's just not here man.

574
00:16:50,950 --> 00:16:51,310
Hmm.

575
00:16:51,310 --> 00:16:52,180
It's just not here.

576
00:16:52,330 --> 00:16:54,610
You could go back and check
that place you were just at.

577
00:16:54,611 --> 00:16:56,650
And then we'd go back and
then nobody would talk to us.

578
00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:59,020
So everybody would diverse.

579
00:16:59,021 --> 00:17:02,500
And it happened numerous times
over three days in North Dakota.

580
00:17:02,501 --> 00:17:06,520
And we ended up pulling out
of that episode because we
went to a steak house one

581
00:17:06,521 --> 00:17:09,970
night to talk and hang
out and meet the locals.

582
00:17:09,971 --> 00:17:10,511
And they were like,

583
00:17:10,511 --> 00:17:11,344
look man,

584
00:17:11,710 --> 00:17:14,320
the politicians like the
people that run this town,

585
00:17:14,321 --> 00:17:14,531
no,

586
00:17:14,531 --> 00:17:15,364
you're here.

587
00:17:15,430 --> 00:17:19,630
But you had tried to schedule
these interviews with the
politicians in this town

588
00:17:19,870 --> 00:17:23,200
and the people involved in the business
and they told you they would do it,

589
00:17:23,201 --> 00:17:26,410
but they bailed because they just wanted
to get you here and then leave you out

590
00:17:26,411 --> 00:17:27,244
to dry.

591
00:17:27,370 --> 00:17:31,930
Like we had a interview scheduled
with all these people in the town and

592
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:33,340
literally the day of we got there,

593
00:17:33,341 --> 00:17:35,350
everybody canceled and everybody diverted.

594
00:17:35,470 --> 00:17:38,230
Why did they want you to go and
then just leave you out to dry?

595
00:17:38,260 --> 00:17:39,820
Why didn't they just want to cancel?

596
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:40,420
Yeah,

597
00:17:40,420 --> 00:17:41,590
I have no idea.

598
00:17:41,770 --> 00:17:42,150
I,

599
00:17:42,150 --> 00:17:42,730
I'm,

600
00:17:42,730 --> 00:17:45,580
I'm guessing that they figured some,

601
00:17:45,610 --> 00:17:49,300
I think some people wanted to talk
to us and then once word got out to,

602
00:17:49,301 --> 00:17:49,531
hey,

603
00:17:49,531 --> 00:17:50,160
there's these guys

604
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:51,270
with cameras in the neighborhood.

605
00:17:51,271 --> 00:17:52,260
It's a small town.

606
00:17:52,470 --> 00:17:53,490
The man camp,

607
00:17:53,491 --> 00:17:56,970
we had to get clearances and once
the people that own the man camp,

608
00:17:56,971 --> 00:17:58,290
what is exactly a man camp?

609
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:03,320
A man camp is literally just rows and
rows of trailers on top of gravel and you

610
00:18:04,111 --> 00:18:04,920
stay,

611
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:08,550
it's like if you're like my school got
hit by hurricanes before and you have

612
00:18:08,551 --> 00:18:09,510
classes in trailers,

613
00:18:09,511 --> 00:18:13,470
people just live in tray these trailers
and they split them up for like three or

614
00:18:13,471 --> 00:18:15,210
four guys and it's,

615
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:17,160
it's one of the most depressing
places you could ever,

616
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:19,370
I think they're wanting
to get you out to the,

617
00:18:19,550 --> 00:18:24,520
to the invite you out to get you to
the man camps cause you're sort of

618
00:18:24,660 --> 00:18:25,181
delicious,

619
00:18:25,181 --> 00:18:27,460
sensitive chip.

620
00:18:27,670 --> 00:18:28,410
This is a

621
00:18:28,410 --> 00:18:29,243
crazy thing.

622
00:18:29,820 --> 00:18:31,230
So I watched those,

623
00:18:31,231 --> 00:18:31,540
a,

624
00:18:31,540 --> 00:18:33,840
the documentary on a fracking,

625
00:18:33,900 --> 00:18:34,440
um,

626
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:34,860
the what?

627
00:18:34,860 --> 00:18:35,760
What the hell is it called?

628
00:18:35,790 --> 00:18:36,630
The famous one.

629
00:18:36,690 --> 00:18:37,620
They did two of them.

630
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:38,783
Yeah.

631
00:18:39,690 --> 00:18:40,650
Some guy named Fox.

632
00:18:40,651 --> 00:18:41,484
Right.

633
00:18:41,940 --> 00:18:42,960
What is that called again?

634
00:18:43,170 --> 00:18:43,860
Gasoline.

635
00:18:43,860 --> 00:18:44,693
Gasoline.

636
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:46,020
Gasoline.

637
00:18:46,020 --> 00:18:47,040
Gasoline was freaky.

638
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:48,000
Yeah.

639
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:48,870
It's really scary.

640
00:18:48,900 --> 00:18:49,410
Yeah.

641
00:18:49,410 --> 00:18:49,981
And I,

642
00:18:49,981 --> 00:18:51,960
I heard the Gaslamp got debunked.

643
00:18:51,990 --> 00:18:52,681
So I said,

644
00:18:52,681 --> 00:18:52,921
okay,

645
00:18:52,921 --> 00:18:54,390
well what's been debunked?

646
00:18:54,391 --> 00:18:55,111
And then I looked at,

647
00:18:55,111 --> 00:18:55,411
I was like,

648
00:18:55,411 --> 00:18:55,741
God,

649
00:18:55,741 --> 00:18:58,000
they're kind of nitpick and if
you're calling that debunks yeah.

650
00:18:58,200 --> 00:18:59,370
And then he did gasoline to,

651
00:18:59,420 --> 00:18:59,590
yeah.

652
00:18:59,590 --> 00:19:03,240
Like he might've been off about some
of the laws and about protection.

653
00:19:03,241 --> 00:19:03,971
I think he,

654
00:19:03,971 --> 00:19:06,360
he misquoted some laws and statistics,

655
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:07,290
but the,

656
00:19:07,290 --> 00:19:11,490
what he didn't miss quote is these fucking
people who talked about these minds

657
00:19:11,491 --> 00:19:12,300
being drilled.

658
00:19:12,300 --> 00:19:14,280
Then all of a sudden their
water lights on fire.

659
00:19:14,410 --> 00:19:15,690
He that that was,

660
00:19:15,691 --> 00:19:16,830
there's no misquoting there

661
00:19:17,020 --> 00:19:17,240
Doug,

662
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:17,841
you're looking at it.

663
00:19:17,841 --> 00:19:18,450
It's crazy.

664
00:19:18,450 --> 00:19:19,540
But that's what happens is,

665
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:20,081
is you know,

666
00:19:20,081 --> 00:19:22,030
you'll do something like for example,

667
00:19:22,031 --> 00:19:25,420
I just said re nine is melting and then
someone will come back and say there's

668
00:19:25,421 --> 00:19:27,700
more ice on the ice sheet and
then there ever has been before,

669
00:19:27,701 --> 00:19:28,210
whatever.

670
00:19:28,210 --> 00:19:28,511
And,

671
00:19:28,511 --> 00:19:28,841
and,

672
00:19:28,841 --> 00:19:33,430
and I bring this up in the doc that every
time I do anything on the environment,

673
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:36,790
you have to be so buttoned up because
everybody comes back to you with a bunch

674
00:19:36,791 --> 00:19:37,301
of bullshit.

675
00:19:37,301 --> 00:19:39,970
And what it is is there'll be like,

676
00:19:39,971 --> 00:19:40,451
for example,

677
00:19:40,451 --> 00:19:40,990
it's winter,

678
00:19:40,990 --> 00:19:41,680
so there's,

679
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:41,921
you know,

680
00:19:41,921 --> 00:19:45,130
there's an increase in the ice shelf
and then there's summer and then the ice

681
00:19:45,131 --> 00:19:46,180
shelf met mounts.

682
00:19:46,181 --> 00:19:48,040
What they do is net ice melt,

683
00:19:48,670 --> 00:19:48,940
right?

684
00:19:48,940 --> 00:19:49,751
That's the whole key.

685
00:19:49,751 --> 00:19:50,584
Is it,

686
00:19:50,590 --> 00:19:55,270
the net of the year is melting and
it's melting like fucking crazy.

687
00:19:55,271 --> 00:19:57,220
Of course there's some
happening in the winter,

688
00:19:57,460 --> 00:20:01,060
but it's the net ice melt and every
time you do anything on the environment,

689
00:20:01,390 --> 00:20:05,020
everybody's got some fucking
crazy stat against whatever.

690
00:20:05,020 --> 00:20:05,853
We did this thing,

691
00:20:06,150 --> 00:20:10,810
all the cows dying in Texas because of
the drought and the cattle ranches can't

692
00:20:10,811 --> 00:20:11,411
afford the water.

693
00:20:11,411 --> 00:20:12,130
Why?

694
00:20:12,130 --> 00:20:13,390
Because the water that they do have,

695
00:20:13,391 --> 00:20:17,590
they're selling to the gas industry for
fracking because they need water infused

696
00:20:17,591 --> 00:20:18,550
with software to get it out.

697
00:20:18,570 --> 00:20:19,980
So you're just like,

698
00:20:20,020 --> 00:20:20,770
look,

699
00:20:20,770 --> 00:20:23,830
it's what I find shocking about it is,

700
00:20:23,831 --> 00:20:24,041
okay,

701
00:20:24,041 --> 00:20:24,730
that's fine.

702
00:20:24,730 --> 00:20:26,160
We've been doing this
shit for a long time.

703
00:20:26,161 --> 00:20:27,370
We say no to things,

704
00:20:27,940 --> 00:20:32,410
but we all live here like the oil guys
are going to fucking get fucked to.

705
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:34,090
Their kids are going to get fuck too.

706
00:20:34,091 --> 00:20:35,860
Like we are shitting where we eat.

707
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:37,180
We are fucking ourselves.

708
00:20:37,181 --> 00:20:40,990
And that's what I find insidious because
you're just saying we're going to fuck

709
00:20:40,991 --> 00:20:42,310
it up for everybody.

710
00:20:42,311 --> 00:20:42,761
And by the way,

711
00:20:42,761 --> 00:20:43,750
we're not just going to fuck it up.

712
00:20:43,990 --> 00:20:48,070
We're going to pay hundreds of millions
of dollars to say it isn't even though

713
00:20:48,070 --> 00:20:50,890
we fucking know it it because it's worth
doing that for the amount of profit

714
00:20:50,891 --> 00:20:51,401
that they can make.

715
00:20:51,401 --> 00:20:53,450
It's Ross Spang spending
hundreds of millions of dollars.

716
00:20:53,451 --> 00:20:54,820
It's not the biggest business.

717
00:20:55,010 --> 00:20:56,800
Did you hear by the time it affects them?

718
00:20:56,801 --> 00:21:01,450
Did you hear about the guy who was the
top EPA climate control specialist?

719
00:21:01,780 --> 00:21:06,460
It turned out that he was saying the
whole time that he was actually undercover

720
00:21:06,461 --> 00:21:07,720
working for the CIA,

721
00:21:07,870 --> 00:21:10,510
so he didn't do his job
with the EPA at all.

722
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:15,100
He told them that he worked for the CIA
and that he had like secret projects and

723
00:21:15,101 --> 00:21:16,000
this was his cover,

724
00:21:16,090 --> 00:21:16,990
so they paid him.

725
00:21:16,991 --> 00:21:21,100
He was the highest paid employee from
the EPA and he was saying he worked for

726
00:21:21,101 --> 00:21:22,000
the CIA,

727
00:21:22,030 --> 00:21:24,010
but he didn't work for the CIA at all,

728
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:26,620
so he was just getting all
this money to fuck off.

729
00:21:26,830 --> 00:21:31,360
So the guy built them at a more than
more than $900,000 over the course of 10

730
00:21:31,361 --> 00:21:32,170
years.

731
00:21:32,170 --> 00:21:36,820
This guy was just basking in cash
and this was their top paid climate

732
00:21:36,821 --> 00:21:37,630
specialist.

733
00:21:37,630 --> 00:21:41,800
They're top paid guy was
literally a complete fraud.

734
00:21:42,220 --> 00:21:42,880
Well that doesn't,

735
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:45,080
that doesn't help our or shit.

736
00:21:45,300 --> 00:21:46,133
Fuck,

737
00:21:46,170 --> 00:21:46,840
fuck it.

738
00:21:46,840 --> 00:21:46,991
Well,

739
00:21:46,991 --> 00:21:47,890
it's not good at all,

740
00:21:47,891 --> 00:21:48,700
but it's like these,

741
00:21:48,700 --> 00:21:50,680
these are the Bozos that are
watching over this thing.

742
00:21:50,681 --> 00:21:50,761
Right?

743
00:21:50,761 --> 00:21:50,881
Right.

744
00:21:50,881 --> 00:21:51,070
Yeah.

745
00:21:51,070 --> 00:21:54,820
Like they let this thrips right through
like don't you have to have like at

746
00:21:54,821 --> 00:21:58,120
least a hall pass from the
CIA before they just say,

747
00:21:58,121 --> 00:21:58,451
Oh,

748
00:21:58,451 --> 00:22:02,230
you worked for the CIO was also that
point earlier in the year with the people

749
00:22:02,231 --> 00:22:03,370
that worked at the SEC.

750
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:06,400
Then went to the banks and the people
that worked at banks went to the SCC and

751
00:22:06,401 --> 00:22:06,761
it's like,

752
00:22:06,761 --> 00:22:06,941
Yo,

753
00:22:06,941 --> 00:22:07,870
who's the gatekeeper?

754
00:22:07,871 --> 00:22:09,550
Like you guys are just
rubbing each other off.

755
00:22:09,551 --> 00:22:09,671
Well,

756
00:22:09,671 --> 00:22:10,504
not only that,

757
00:22:10,570 --> 00:22:15,070
it's the educational institutions that
set the standards and parameters for the

758
00:22:15,071 --> 00:22:17,060
business to be practiced and leave.

759
00:22:17,080 --> 00:22:20,980
There are institutions and
get giant cushy jobs at these,

760
00:22:20,981 --> 00:22:24,610
these banks and investment houses and
there was all detailed on inside job.

761
00:22:24,670 --> 00:22:25,503
You see.

762
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:26,331
Brilliant.

763
00:22:26,331 --> 00:22:27,730
There was a documentary on the fall.

764
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:28,940
Great piece recently.

765
00:22:28,941 --> 00:22:33,941
On the 12 bipartisan
senators and Congressmen
congresspeople who passed the uh,

766
00:22:37,190 --> 00:22:38,470
big Pharma that the health,

767
00:22:38,490 --> 00:22:38,731
the,

768
00:22:38,731 --> 00:22:38,891
the,

769
00:22:38,891 --> 00:22:42,260
the pharmaceutical law
and of the 12 of them,

770
00:22:42,410 --> 00:22:47,390
12 quit before their term was over and
went to work at big Pharma and their

771
00:22:47,391 --> 00:22:49,760
average salary in Congress
was like 150 grand.

772
00:22:49,761 --> 00:22:50,600
Their average salary,

773
00:22:50,601 --> 00:22:52,700
average salary when they left with 7.5

774
00:22:52,990 --> 00:22:56,710
Jesus Christ and you're just like,

775
00:22:56,830 --> 00:22:57,151
oh,

776
00:22:57,151 --> 00:22:57,984
that's from,

777
00:22:58,290 --> 00:22:59,290
it's from the town.

778
00:22:59,291 --> 00:23:01,330
I believe it's from the objective.

779
00:23:01,331 --> 00:23:02,350
When they pass those laws,

780
00:23:02,351 --> 00:23:04,150
making a hundred objective,

781
00:23:04,750 --> 00:23:06,430
they were just counting that cash.

782
00:23:06,850 --> 00:23:08,350
Just thinking about that boat,

783
00:23:09,850 --> 00:23:12,070
drive it in that Porsche convertible.

784
00:23:12,130 --> 00:23:12,750
Oh,

785
00:23:12,750 --> 00:23:14,020
like winning American

786
00:23:14,100 --> 00:23:14,611
can idle.

787
00:23:14,611 --> 00:23:15,600
You know I got elected.

788
00:23:15,940 --> 00:23:16,320
Yeah.

789
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:17,520
I'm going to do a couple,

790
00:23:17,521 --> 00:23:18,810
a couple records,

791
00:23:18,811 --> 00:23:21,140
a under contract and then
I'm going to go and fucking

792
00:23:21,370 --> 00:23:22,001
not only that,

793
00:23:22,001 --> 00:23:23,110
the standards have been set.

794
00:23:23,170 --> 00:23:24,880
It's like that's what's been done.

795
00:23:24,910 --> 00:23:25,691
It's been done many,

796
00:23:25,691 --> 00:23:26,231
many times,

797
00:23:26,231 --> 00:23:27,490
so they look at it as an option.

798
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:28,571
Then not only that,

799
00:23:28,571 --> 00:23:30,340
they look at it as the
most profitable option,

800
00:23:30,341 --> 00:23:31,630
which is always the one
that everybody jumps.

801
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:32,890
It's perfectly fine.

802
00:23:33,870 --> 00:23:34,960
We're going to become a lobbyist.

803
00:23:34,990 --> 00:23:37,420
It's going to become a
thing like almost like a,

804
00:23:37,421 --> 00:23:41,290
like a lawyer that's trying to get a
guilty client off and it's like as a,

805
00:23:41,291 --> 00:23:42,760
as a law before a lobbyist,

806
00:23:42,761 --> 00:23:43,511
as an educator,

807
00:23:43,511 --> 00:23:43,811
it's like,

808
00:23:43,811 --> 00:23:48,020
what can I get an intellectually
behind and defend,

809
00:23:48,060 --> 00:23:48,450
right?

810
00:23:48,450 --> 00:23:49,280
How much,

811
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:53,810
how much without being objective at all
and just trying to satisfy my own need

812
00:23:53,811 --> 00:23:54,290
for money.

813
00:23:54,290 --> 00:23:55,123
Oh my knee.

814
00:23:55,320 --> 00:23:55,761
If I'm,

815
00:23:55,761 --> 00:23:58,700
if I'm like a multibillion
dollar a Pharma Company,

816
00:23:58,910 --> 00:24:03,170
I'm going to hire the guy that wrote
the law to get what I want done.

817
00:24:03,460 --> 00:24:05,180
Those conversations take place.

818
00:24:05,330 --> 00:24:07,130
How those conversations
take place with someone?

819
00:24:07,340 --> 00:24:08,630
Did they bring you in your office and go,

820
00:24:08,631 --> 00:24:09,464
listen,

821
00:24:09,650 --> 00:24:14,030
I'm this fucking stupid law that
tells us that we can't frack.

822
00:24:14,210 --> 00:24:16,490
That's dumb and that's
keeping us from making money.

823
00:24:16,491 --> 00:24:18,860
Fuck all those people and
their blowed up drinking water.

824
00:24:19,280 --> 00:24:21,020
We need to figure out how
to get the fuck in there.

825
00:24:21,021 --> 00:24:21,500
Come on.

826
00:24:21,500 --> 00:24:22,010
They,

827
00:24:22,010 --> 00:24:25,490
they fund their election campaigns
on both sides and whoever wins,

828
00:24:25,491 --> 00:24:25,731
I say,

829
00:24:25,731 --> 00:24:25,881
Hey,

830
00:24:25,881 --> 00:24:26,960
I funded your election campaign.

831
00:24:26,961 --> 00:24:27,860
You want a lot more of this?

832
00:24:28,170 --> 00:24:29,120
I want to tons more money.

833
00:24:29,121 --> 00:24:30,140
You want to get elected again?

834
00:24:30,260 --> 00:24:30,441
Boy,

835
00:24:30,441 --> 00:24:32,050
you want to sign while I get elected.

836
00:24:32,060 --> 00:24:34,100
Just come over and how is that legal to,

837
00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:36,770
how's it legal to fucking
give money to both sides?

838
00:24:37,160 --> 00:24:38,870
That's crazy money whenever you want.

839
00:24:39,110 --> 00:24:41,540
It's just you fucking greedy ass holes.

840
00:24:42,230 --> 00:24:44,090
So it costs a lot of money to get elected.

841
00:24:44,300 --> 00:24:44,600
It should,

842
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:45,200
but it's just,

843
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:48,920
it's so blatant that that's the
fact that that's how the system is.

844
00:24:48,950 --> 00:24:51,790
That's the actual system
itself that that you know,

845
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:52,820
the people running things like,

846
00:24:52,821 --> 00:24:53,090
yeah,

847
00:24:53,090 --> 00:24:54,230
that makes sense.

848
00:24:54,280 --> 00:24:57,520
The reason why they can do it is because
we're one of the most misinformed

849
00:24:57,521 --> 00:24:58,070
generations,

850
00:24:58,070 --> 00:25:02,470
like the information gap between your
average reader and then the people making

851
00:25:02,471 --> 00:25:05,410
these laws and the people
making the deals is gigantic.

852
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:07,600
Anything is because too
many laws have been passed.

853
00:25:07,630 --> 00:25:09,550
It's just like too much illegal like,

854
00:25:09,790 --> 00:25:10,331
well for instance,

855
00:25:10,331 --> 00:25:11,710
like let's say we look at the tax code,

856
00:25:11,711 --> 00:25:14,980
write the tax code is thousands and
thousands and thousands of pages,

857
00:25:14,981 --> 00:25:17,320
like for an average
citizen to go read that,

858
00:25:17,321 --> 00:25:18,910
there's no way it's incomprehensible.

859
00:25:18,940 --> 00:25:19,360
Right?

860
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:23,200
They just added so many pages in so
many complexities so that the average

861
00:25:23,201 --> 00:25:23,621
person,

862
00:25:23,621 --> 00:25:26,680
you know we used to have a duty to
overthrow like the social contract,

863
00:25:26,710 --> 00:25:27,401
like John Locke,

864
00:25:27,401 --> 00:25:28,750
you go back to the social contract,

865
00:25:29,020 --> 00:25:33,040
there's a duty to challenge a government
and even to the extent overthrow it

866
00:25:33,220 --> 00:25:36,180
when you think that it's
not doing justice to,

867
00:25:36,181 --> 00:25:36,670
to the,

868
00:25:36,670 --> 00:25:39,100
to the constitution or whatever
your social contract is,

869
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:44,520
but now the average person really is
helpless and paralyzed because let's say

870
00:25:44,951 --> 00:25:46,120
you wanted to understand tech,

871
00:25:46,150 --> 00:25:49,570
you can't even just go understand
tax like things are so specialized.

872
00:25:49,571 --> 00:25:52,630
It's like the assembly line
has taken over everything.

873
00:25:52,810 --> 00:25:56,810
So we may know one thing like
you mean you got comma you got,

874
00:25:58,240 --> 00:26:01,270
I mean I feel like we
only can know so much.

875
00:26:01,271 --> 00:26:05,890
There's so much to know and things
have become so specialized that it's,

876
00:26:06,280 --> 00:26:09,700
it's very tough to kind of
strike back at the empire.

877
00:26:10,450 --> 00:26:11,350
Do you think though,

878
00:26:11,351 --> 00:26:14,560
that with all this like Edward Snowden
type shit and all these leaks that are

879
00:26:14,561 --> 00:26:18,100
coming out over and over again with
these connections between politicians and

880
00:26:18,101 --> 00:26:19,130
money and the,

881
00:26:19,140 --> 00:26:21,940
the influence is more transparency,

882
00:26:21,941 --> 00:26:23,890
more things have been
exposed now than ever before.

883
00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:25,900
Do you think that's going to
make it more difficult to do?

884
00:26:25,990 --> 00:26:26,770
No,

885
00:26:26,770 --> 00:26:27,130
no.

886
00:26:27,130 --> 00:26:27,970
I think everybody goes,

887
00:26:27,971 --> 00:26:28,780
Yep.

888
00:26:28,780 --> 00:26:29,081
I mean,

889
00:26:29,081 --> 00:26:30,040
everybody knows it now.

890
00:26:30,070 --> 00:26:31,320
That's the whole thing is,

891
00:26:31,321 --> 00:26:32,860
is this book just came out of the town.

892
00:26:33,100 --> 00:26:33,521
Everybody goes,

893
00:26:33,521 --> 00:26:33,821
Yep.

894
00:26:33,821 --> 00:26:34,840
Meaning they just accept it.

895
00:26:34,930 --> 00:26:35,763
Yeah.

896
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:37,240
And I agree.

897
00:26:37,390 --> 00:26:38,223
Look,

898
00:26:38,380 --> 00:26:39,250
I think that,

899
00:26:39,700 --> 00:26:39,971
you know,

900
00:26:39,971 --> 00:26:41,100
you do have a,

901
00:26:41,160 --> 00:26:41,410
uh,

902
00:26:41,410 --> 00:26:42,820
you get the government you deserve.

903
00:26:43,050 --> 00:26:43,411
You know,

904
00:26:43,411 --> 00:26:44,070
and right

905
00:26:44,070 --> 00:26:45,870
now we're very complacent and we're just,

906
00:26:45,871 --> 00:26:46,201
all right,

907
00:26:46,201 --> 00:26:46,271
well,

908
00:26:46,271 --> 00:26:46,920
whatever.

909
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:47,753
We know it's fun.

910
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:48,200
Cookies.

911
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:48,530
We know.

912
00:26:48,530 --> 00:26:48,780
Yeah,

913
00:26:48,780 --> 00:26:49,770
we know it's fucked up.

914
00:26:49,890 --> 00:26:50,820
We know it doesn't work.

915
00:26:50,821 --> 00:26:51,690
We know it's corrupt.

916
00:26:51,990 --> 00:26:52,801
We know that the,

917
00:26:52,801 --> 00:26:53,161
by the way,

918
00:26:53,161 --> 00:26:53,991
there's good luck there.

919
00:26:53,991 --> 00:26:57,240
They're playing chicken with the
country every fucking month saying,

920
00:26:57,241 --> 00:26:57,451
well,

921
00:26:57,451 --> 00:26:58,480
we're going to default now or not.

922
00:26:58,540 --> 00:26:59,070
I guess we are.

923
00:26:59,070 --> 00:26:59,221
No,

924
00:26:59,221 --> 00:26:59,521
we're not.

925
00:26:59,521 --> 00:27:00,140
Yesterday are,

926
00:27:00,140 --> 00:27:00,480
you know,

927
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:02,280
the stock market's going
up and down and everything.

928
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:03,300
It doesn't work.

929
00:27:03,330 --> 00:27:04,680
It's broken and everyone goes,

930
00:27:04,770 --> 00:27:05,420
ah,

931
00:27:05,420 --> 00:27:07,910
and it's the least productive
Congress we've ever had.

932
00:27:08,430 --> 00:27:11,600
They've passed the least amount of bills
ever in the bills that have passed or

933
00:27:11,601 --> 00:27:12,500
like fluff bills.

934
00:27:12,980 --> 00:27:17,980
So what else fucking vampires is
sitting there sucking money out.

935
00:27:18,750 --> 00:27:20,430
Well that's the other
thing is how I like it.

936
00:27:20,490 --> 00:27:21,241
Tax Tax,

937
00:27:21,241 --> 00:27:21,541
tax,

938
00:27:21,541 --> 00:27:22,021
tax tax.

939
00:27:22,021 --> 00:27:22,950
And what are they doing with it?

940
00:27:22,980 --> 00:27:25,290
They're just fighting their own
little fucking bottles in Washington.

941
00:27:25,550 --> 00:27:25,930
No lie.

942
00:27:25,930 --> 00:27:29,090
I think to answer those for
people like you and Shane to run,

943
00:27:29,320 --> 00:27:30,180
no lie,

944
00:27:31,280 --> 00:27:31,880
no lie.

945
00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:33,940
Because like why not though?

946
00:27:33,980 --> 00:27:34,220
No.

947
00:27:34,220 --> 00:27:35,320
The answers the aliens.

948
00:27:35,350 --> 00:27:36,183
Do you ever see

949
00:27:38,270 --> 00:27:41,750
discussion one time when one of
our drunken ones as opposed to now,

950
00:27:42,340 --> 00:27:43,173
uh,

951
00:27:43,670 --> 00:27:44,480
when we said,

952
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:44,841
you know,

953
00:27:44,841 --> 00:27:45,501
when you run,

954
00:27:45,501 --> 00:27:46,510
when they,

955
00:27:46,680 --> 00:27:47,810
they get everything.

956
00:27:47,811 --> 00:27:49,100
Anything you've ever done.

957
00:27:49,460 --> 00:27:51,680
Do you want to talk
about 3000 page tax code?

958
00:27:51,681 --> 00:27:52,370
My,

959
00:27:52,370 --> 00:27:53,750
everything bad I've ever done,

960
00:27:53,751 --> 00:27:55,580
but 30,000 pages of Shit.

961
00:27:55,940 --> 00:27:58,430
That's why like you have to be like
Mitt Romney who never did anything.

962
00:27:58,431 --> 00:27:58,850
And I'm like,

963
00:27:58,850 --> 00:28:03,170
I don't want Mitt Romney to run the
crunchy because he's done nothing wrong

964
00:28:03,171 --> 00:28:04,700
cause nobody's done nothing wrong.

965
00:28:04,940 --> 00:28:07,000
Everybody does bad shit everyday.

966
00:28:07,090 --> 00:28:07,923
Like you know,

967
00:28:08,210 --> 00:28:10,210
so having somebody you know,

968
00:28:10,211 --> 00:28:11,001
well I dunno,

969
00:28:11,001 --> 00:28:12,080
maybe he kills kittens.

970
00:28:12,081 --> 00:28:12,381
I don't know.

971
00:28:12,381 --> 00:28:13,370
But you know,

972
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:14,233
generally,

973
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:16,580
but to me that's what's abnormal.

974
00:28:16,581 --> 00:28:19,280
What's abnormal is never
having done anything bad.

975
00:28:19,580 --> 00:28:20,091
And you're like,

976
00:28:20,091 --> 00:28:20,990
that's not human.

977
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:23,990
I think everyone's bullshit's
going to be exposed one day.

978
00:28:24,070 --> 00:28:25,090
I think one day,

979
00:28:25,091 --> 00:28:26,800
I mean it might be our kids,

980
00:28:26,830 --> 00:28:28,390
the generations growing up right now,

981
00:28:28,450 --> 00:28:30,700
it might be the only kids that
never get to have secrets.

982
00:28:31,030 --> 00:28:35,050
Whereas like we've kept secrets for
the longest time and then secrets are

983
00:28:35,051 --> 00:28:37,160
exposed on the Internet and
that's very interesting.

984
00:28:37,161 --> 00:28:38,650
There's more transparency now than ever.

985
00:28:38,651 --> 00:28:40,780
I think there's going to be
no secrets in the future.

986
00:28:40,781 --> 00:28:42,310
I think there's a backlash against this.

987
00:28:42,311 --> 00:28:43,870
No secret bullshit for sure.

988
00:28:44,450 --> 00:28:45,650
Book was like no secrets,

989
00:28:45,651 --> 00:28:46,281
no secrets,

990
00:28:46,281 --> 00:28:48,380
because Zuckerberg never had a girlfriend.

991
00:28:48,381 --> 00:28:48,801
So He's like you.

992
00:28:48,801 --> 00:28:49,880
Everybody wants to know everything.

993
00:28:50,210 --> 00:28:52,460
And then Evan comes along
with snapchat and goes,

994
00:28:52,700 --> 00:28:54,650
actually I had girlfriends
and many of them,

995
00:28:54,651 --> 00:28:55,484
so uh,

996
00:28:56,550 --> 00:29:00,360
there is to only privacy
now and so exposed.

997
00:29:00,420 --> 00:29:02,490
They have an inability to hide,

998
00:29:02,491 --> 00:29:06,030
but I think that's going to be going
to change because these politicians

999
00:29:06,031 --> 00:29:06,271
running,

1000
00:29:06,271 --> 00:29:08,130
if you look at like their
twitters and they're following,

1001
00:29:08,190 --> 00:29:09,690
they don't have nearly
as many people as you.

1002
00:29:10,230 --> 00:29:11,400
You can use social media.

1003
00:29:11,401 --> 00:29:12,620
I bet you could run and win.

1004
00:29:12,930 --> 00:29:14,910
I don't want to run and when
I don't want to run anything,

1005
00:29:14,911 --> 00:29:15,190
I'll get,

1006
00:29:15,190 --> 00:29:16,470
I pay my taxes and hide.

1007
00:29:16,471 --> 00:29:19,440
You got to do it for the source of the
top two out of the forest with other

1008
00:29:19,441 --> 00:29:20,274
shit.

1009
00:29:20,430 --> 00:29:21,210
That's the thing.

1010
00:29:21,210 --> 00:29:23,000
Everybody has their own path in life.

1011
00:29:23,820 --> 00:29:25,020
Everyone has their own path in life.

1012
00:29:26,100 --> 00:29:26,790
Rogan,

1013
00:29:26,790 --> 00:29:27,623
nation,

1014
00:29:27,810 --> 00:29:28,643
barely

1015
00:29:29,910 --> 00:29:30,840
puppet government.

1016
00:29:30,841 --> 00:29:33,990
If I ever did when and
anybody ever did listen to me,

1017
00:29:33,991 --> 00:29:36,510
whether it'd be a sorry
state of this world,

1018
00:29:36,780 --> 00:29:39,630
a person who is acknowledged
to be half retarded.

1019
00:29:40,190 --> 00:29:41,620
I think this Shane is right man.

1020
00:29:41,621 --> 00:29:42,160
We deserve

1021
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:45,130
the government we get and I don't
think unless we get involved,

1022
00:29:45,220 --> 00:29:46,600
I wish kids would get involved.

1023
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:47,270
You know,

1024
00:29:47,270 --> 00:29:47,700
it's also,

1025
00:29:47,700 --> 00:29:51,070
I think the entire culture is changing
at a pretty rapid rate whether we realize

1026
00:29:51,071 --> 00:29:51,491
it or not.

1027
00:29:51,491 --> 00:29:54,590
I think the Internet over
the last 20 years has changed

1028
00:29:56,740 --> 00:30:00,280
so much in such a vast degree from,

1029
00:30:00,310 --> 00:30:00,671
you know,

1030
00:30:00,671 --> 00:30:02,440
where we were as a culture then.

1031
00:30:02,620 --> 00:30:06,190
I think we're still in the midst of this
crazy wave that's washed over us and we

1032
00:30:06,191 --> 00:30:07,870
haven't let everything settle down yet.

1033
00:30:07,930 --> 00:30:10,030
100% it's still going to,

1034
00:30:10,300 --> 00:30:11,050
I mean this isn't good.

1035
00:30:11,050 --> 00:30:14,950
I think ultimately we're going to have
to figure out a way to vote online and

1036
00:30:14,951 --> 00:30:16,690
when we figure out a way to vote online,

1037
00:30:17,250 --> 00:30:21,850
a least one group is going to set up a
way to have a mirror vote that doesn't

1038
00:30:21,851 --> 00:30:22,271
count,

1039
00:30:22,271 --> 00:30:25,510
but allows people to know for a fact
that it hasn't been fucked with.

1040
00:30:25,900 --> 00:30:30,900
It's really easy to click on two sites
to how I vote and then you have like

1041
00:30:32,040 --> 00:30:34,420
pledge to do the true vote as well.

1042
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:38,620
So everybody goes to true vote.com and
they set up a thing there so they know

1043
00:30:38,740 --> 00:30:40,660
this is not affiliated
with the government,

1044
00:30:40,661 --> 00:30:42,400
it's not affiliated with any corporations.

1045
00:30:42,550 --> 00:30:46,510
It's just set up by a nonprofit
to only collect votes.

1046
00:30:46,511 --> 00:30:50,200
Then you give everybody's Ip a
very specific amount of votes.

1047
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:51,520
You find out what you know,

1048
00:30:51,521 --> 00:30:52,600
how many people are in the household,

1049
00:30:52,630 --> 00:30:54,730
verify and get everyone to socials.

1050
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:56,440
Get all in a fucking database,

1051
00:30:56,530 --> 00:30:58,900
and then let's see if the votes real.

1052
00:30:59,080 --> 00:31:00,700
Let's see if the digital vote is real.

1053
00:31:00,701 --> 00:31:03,670
If it's been fucked with and you'd count
it to true vote and that way you keep

1054
00:31:03,671 --> 00:31:04,390
them honest.

1055
00:31:04,390 --> 00:31:06,190
You just have a few of these true votes,

1056
00:31:06,310 --> 00:31:08,650
things that are certified by whoever,

1057
00:31:08,680 --> 00:31:08,921
you know,

1058
00:31:08,921 --> 00:31:09,550
whoever,

1059
00:31:09,550 --> 00:31:13,240
and we figured out a way to find out
what the fuck people really want.

1060
00:31:13,540 --> 00:31:15,640
That will change everything.

1061
00:31:15,940 --> 00:31:20,940
That will fucking change everything that
and someone coming along and figuring

1062
00:31:21,311 --> 00:31:26,050
out and organized way to utilize people
the same way corporations utilize their

1063
00:31:26,051 --> 00:31:26,790
people,

1064
00:31:26,790 --> 00:31:27,100
they,

1065
00:31:27,100 --> 00:31:28,930
there's that money's coming from people.

1066
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:32,650
It's coming from people that work
there that makes sure the corporation

1067
00:31:32,651 --> 00:31:33,580
continues to make money.

1068
00:31:33,640 --> 00:31:35,530
Stockholders behind that,

1069
00:31:35,650 --> 00:31:36,730
the people who run it,

1070
00:31:36,820 --> 00:31:37,750
it's all people.

1071
00:31:37,870 --> 00:31:42,520
If you get a gang of people that believes
that you shouldn't be shitting into

1072
00:31:42,521 --> 00:31:44,770
the water wells of South Dakota,

1073
00:31:44,780 --> 00:31:46,690
north wall of these fucking
places where they're fracking.

1074
00:31:47,020 --> 00:31:50,040
If you get everybody to put
their money behind that you're,

1075
00:31:50,041 --> 00:31:51,880
you're talking about corporation money,

1076
00:31:52,510 --> 00:31:54,460
you get a bunch of people
to put in five bucks,

1077
00:31:54,461 --> 00:31:55,600
you get a few million of those,

1078
00:31:55,690 --> 00:31:57,460
you got some real fucking money to play.

1079
00:31:57,730 --> 00:31:58,540
I also think thank

1080
00:31:58,540 --> 00:31:59,170
you have,

1081
00:31:59,170 --> 00:31:59,770
you know,

1082
00:31:59,770 --> 00:32:00,410
uh,

1083
00:32:00,410 --> 00:32:01,360
as that he was saying,

1084
00:32:01,361 --> 00:32:01,841
you know,

1085
00:32:01,841 --> 00:32:05,070
this generation is completely
different than any other generation.

1086
00:32:05,071 --> 00:32:07,630
I want to talk about Gen y
and they've come up with this,

1087
00:32:07,660 --> 00:32:12,660
the different and the healthy sort of
disregard for the political system of the

1088
00:32:12,671 --> 00:32:13,181
media,

1089
00:32:13,181 --> 00:32:13,901
for the news,

1090
00:32:13,901 --> 00:32:15,130
for all these things.

1091
00:32:15,131 --> 00:32:15,280
They,

1092
00:32:15,280 --> 00:32:16,080
they get there.

1093
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:17,290
They informed themselves,

1094
00:32:17,291 --> 00:32:18,370
as you were saying in their own way.

1095
00:32:18,850 --> 00:32:22,090
And I think that they're going to work
outside of the system a lot and I think

1096
00:32:22,091 --> 00:32:24,070
they're going to use the
tools that they grew up with,

1097
00:32:24,310 --> 00:32:24,810
which are these,

1098
00:32:24,810 --> 00:32:25,030
you know,

1099
00:32:25,030 --> 00:32:25,950
social media tools,

1100
00:32:26,140 --> 00:32:26,441
tools.

1101
00:32:26,441 --> 00:32:30,120
He's brand new tools to do shit in a
way that we can't even fucking imagine.

1102
00:32:30,121 --> 00:32:31,180
And you're already seeing it happening.

1103
00:32:31,181 --> 00:32:34,420
Obviously you see it happening in other
places like Arab spring and around the

1104
00:32:34,421 --> 00:32:36,520
world and China and
Southeast Asia and China.

1105
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:37,420
But like,

1106
00:32:37,420 --> 00:32:38,680
you know when it hits here,

1107
00:32:38,681 --> 00:32:39,070
it's,

1108
00:32:39,070 --> 00:32:39,290
it's,

1109
00:32:39,290 --> 00:32:39,990
it's gonna be

1110
00:32:39,990 --> 00:32:40,840
a fucking revolution,

1111
00:32:40,841 --> 00:32:41,440
I hope.

1112
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:41,741
Yeah.

1113
00:32:41,741 --> 00:32:41,981
No,

1114
00:32:41,981 --> 00:32:44,770
people are going to get to a point
where they realize if they don't do it,

1115
00:32:44,771 --> 00:32:46,090
nobody else is gonna do it for them.

1116
00:32:46,420 --> 00:32:48,190
Your parents definitely ain't
doing that shift for you.

1117
00:32:49,140 --> 00:32:49,310
No,

1118
00:32:49,310 --> 00:32:49,440
no.

1119
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:50,280
My parents' dog,

1120
00:32:51,060 --> 00:32:51,893
my parents,

1121
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:53,310
not the Internet.

1122
00:32:53,460 --> 00:32:53,820
Amazing.

1123
00:32:53,820 --> 00:32:57,150
But the Internet is also this amazing
tool to distract you from everything that

1124
00:32:57,151 --> 00:32:58,470
you need to do and you need to read.

1125
00:32:58,471 --> 00:32:59,790
Like you have the ability to,

1126
00:32:59,791 --> 00:33:01,770
to jerk off every five
minutes if you want to.

1127
00:33:01,771 --> 00:33:02,460
So yeah,

1128
00:33:02,460 --> 00:33:03,510
I don't have that ability.

1129
00:33:03,511 --> 00:33:06,870
I don't know what you're saying and
know that I need to get it though.

1130
00:33:07,260 --> 00:33:08,850
Every five minutes on your own.

1131
00:33:08,930 --> 00:33:10,020
You're a God damn rabbit.

1132
00:33:10,021 --> 00:33:10,260
Yeah.

1133
00:33:10,260 --> 00:33:10,741
Chinese.

1134
00:33:10,741 --> 00:33:11,521
We are rabbits.

1135
00:33:11,521 --> 00:33:12,770
Look how many people we made.

1136
00:33:12,840 --> 00:33:13,860
That's a good point.

1137
00:33:14,390 --> 00:33:15,171
That's a good point,

1138
00:33:15,171 --> 00:33:15,740
man.

1139
00:33:15,740 --> 00:33:17,090
It's a very good point actually.

1140
00:33:17,190 --> 00:33:19,130
But the Chinese and the
Indians should have a war.

1141
00:33:19,131 --> 00:33:20,210
So who fucks the most?

1142
00:33:20,390 --> 00:33:20,631
Yeah,

1143
00:33:20,631 --> 00:33:22,010
we could throw a lot of milkshakes.

1144
00:33:22,100 --> 00:33:22,670
Indians,

1145
00:33:22,670 --> 00:33:23,121
Indians,

1146
00:33:23,121 --> 00:33:23,451
I think.

1147
00:33:23,451 --> 00:33:24,620
Would Indians win?

1148
00:33:24,650 --> 00:33:24,831
Well,

1149
00:33:24,831 --> 00:33:25,730
they have books on it.

1150
00:33:25,731 --> 00:33:26,280
Right?

1151
00:33:26,280 --> 00:33:27,410
So the Chinese though.

1152
00:33:27,690 --> 00:33:27,941
Yeah,

1153
00:33:27,941 --> 00:33:28,280
yeah,

1154
00:33:28,280 --> 00:33:28,461
yeah.

1155
00:33:28,461 --> 00:33:28,611
No,

1156
00:33:28,611 --> 00:33:29,310
the Indians,

1157
00:33:29,310 --> 00:33:31,010
it's a more refined act for them.

1158
00:33:31,011 --> 00:33:31,410
They have,

1159
00:33:31,410 --> 00:33:32,780
they have a method to their madness.

1160
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:34,400
Chinese just fucking,

1161
00:33:34,580 --> 00:33:35,301
we just fucking,

1162
00:33:35,301 --> 00:33:35,900
we out there.

1163
00:33:35,900 --> 00:33:39,590
What's so crazy now they're allowing
Chinese people in China to have more than

1164
00:33:39,591 --> 00:33:40,150
one baby.

1165
00:33:40,150 --> 00:33:42,610
If they came from single baby households,

1166
00:33:42,680 --> 00:33:43,700
single child households,

1167
00:33:43,701 --> 00:33:44,660
which is kinda interesting.

1168
00:33:44,800 --> 00:33:45,200
Yup.

1169
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:48,860
Well they have problems there because
there's 50 million more men than women.

1170
00:33:48,861 --> 00:33:49,281
So they,

1171
00:33:49,281 --> 00:33:49,761
it's just,

1172
00:33:49,761 --> 00:33:51,290
that is crazy.

1173
00:33:51,291 --> 00:33:52,790
There's also ghost
towns they need to fill.

1174
00:33:52,910 --> 00:33:53,570
There you go.

1175
00:33:53,570 --> 00:33:53,781
Yeah.

1176
00:33:53,781 --> 00:33:54,890
That's also crazy.

1177
00:33:55,020 --> 00:33:55,400
Yeah.

1178
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:55,850
Yeah.

1179
00:33:55,850 --> 00:33:57,170
Did you guys cover something like that?

1180
00:33:57,410 --> 00:33:58,221
Vice Shane did.

1181
00:33:58,221 --> 00:34:01,490
I was in China for a month this
summer to write my second book.

1182
00:34:01,491 --> 00:34:03,500
I was in Chengdu for about three weeks.

1183
00:34:03,501 --> 00:34:06,590
I was in Shanghai for a week
and I was in Mongolia for weeks.

1184
00:34:06,591 --> 00:34:08,780
I was just hanging out out
there to see and things.

1185
00:34:08,781 --> 00:34:09,091
It's pretty,

1186
00:34:09,091 --> 00:34:09,180
yeah.

1187
00:34:09,180 --> 00:34:09,540
Crazy.

1188
00:34:09,540 --> 00:34:14,320
What is that one town in China
that's a replica of another town.

1189
00:34:14,350 --> 00:34:15,150
There's a lot of them.

1190
00:34:15,150 --> 00:34:16,020
There's Paris.

1191
00:34:16,080 --> 00:34:16,740
Really?

1192
00:34:16,740 --> 00:34:18,210
They have a replica Paris.

1193
00:34:18,390 --> 00:34:20,310
Nobody lives in like U Albany lives.

1194
00:34:20,311 --> 00:34:21,210
They're completely empty.

1195
00:34:21,240 --> 00:34:22,073
Completely empty.

1196
00:34:22,410 --> 00:34:24,990
3% occupancy.

1197
00:34:25,020 --> 00:34:25,260
Yeah,

1198
00:34:25,260 --> 00:34:25,900
three.

1199
00:34:25,900 --> 00:34:26,300
Yeah.

1200
00:34:26,300 --> 00:34:27,270
That must be the weirdest.

1201
00:34:27,271 --> 00:34:27,690
They have.

1202
00:34:27,690 --> 00:34:29,310
They have like a Scandinavia.

1203
00:34:29,311 --> 00:34:30,480
They have a Paris,

1204
00:34:31,110 --> 00:34:34,170
they have like a can
of Italian themed one.

1205
00:34:34,230 --> 00:34:35,060
Oh my God.

1206
00:34:35,060 --> 00:34:36,000
They're fucking crazy.

1207
00:34:36,030 --> 00:34:36,863
The Paris one.

1208
00:34:37,110 --> 00:34:37,500
Yeah.

1209
00:34:37,500 --> 00:34:38,400
Oh my God.

1210
00:34:38,430 --> 00:34:39,540
Where did these people get their food?

1211
00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:41,410
That was one of the best episodes on vice.

1212
00:34:41,580 --> 00:34:44,160
That's so fucking strange.

1213
00:34:44,161 --> 00:34:44,460
Yeah.

1214
00:34:44,460 --> 00:34:45,630
The thing is with China,

1215
00:34:46,370 --> 00:34:47,280
it's everything

1216
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:50,131
about that country.

1217
00:34:50,131 --> 00:34:54,840
If you go now though is it's at that
point in a civilization where the people

1218
00:34:54,841 --> 00:34:56,310
may be able to catch the matrix.

1219
00:34:56,311 --> 00:34:59,640
Like in America there's Snowden and he's
great and he's this blip on the radar.

1220
00:34:59,910 --> 00:35:00,990
We had wiki leaks,

1221
00:35:01,320 --> 00:35:03,690
but as soon as there's one of those guys,

1222
00:35:03,720 --> 00:35:05,190
the government and the Matrix,

1223
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:09,030
it adapts so much faster than the
people like it can take care of that.

1224
00:35:09,300 --> 00:35:09,661
It can.

1225
00:35:09,661 --> 00:35:11,040
So I don't know about that.

1226
00:35:11,380 --> 00:35:13,600
The government is actually offering him,

1227
00:35:13,601 --> 00:35:17,530
there's this people in the NSA that
are offering him immunity if he,

1228
00:35:17,531 --> 00:35:17,801
uh,

1229
00:35:17,801 --> 00:35:20,830
if he returns all the rest of his
files because apparently he's was only

1230
00:35:20,831 --> 00:35:23,530
released 1% of the files
that he took from the NSA.

1231
00:35:23,590 --> 00:35:24,790
Or you're saying the Chinese?

1232
00:35:25,020 --> 00:35:25,330
Well,

1233
00:35:25,330 --> 00:35:26,820
China's interesting to me.

1234
00:35:26,850 --> 00:35:27,780
Like I know what you're saying,

1235
00:35:27,781 --> 00:35:29,580
like snow students and I love Snowden.

1236
00:35:29,581 --> 00:35:32,520
Snowden should have one time
person of the year in my opinion,

1237
00:35:32,521 --> 00:35:33,960
he should have fucking
one person in the year.

1238
00:35:33,961 --> 00:35:35,160
But China,

1239
00:35:35,161 --> 00:35:39,330
what's interesting is there isn't this
stranglehold on the local government.

1240
00:35:39,660 --> 00:35:44,250
The local government isn't as strong as
it is in America because the tentacles

1241
00:35:44,251 --> 00:35:46,500
of government here are refined.

1242
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:48,150
Like it really has a grip on us.

1243
00:35:48,151 --> 00:35:50,160
It sees everything in China.

1244
00:35:50,250 --> 00:35:53,340
There is a line of chaos and
people can do their own thing.

1245
00:35:53,341 --> 00:35:54,900
Like when you go to a bank in China,

1246
00:35:55,140 --> 00:36:00,060
there are homies in there with just a
bag of money and a calculator selling

1247
00:36:00,120 --> 00:36:02,130
currency at a rate below the bank.

1248
00:36:02,520 --> 00:36:04,350
And nobody goes into his
business with the bank.

1249
00:36:04,530 --> 00:36:06,630
So there's a lot of
this like kind of wild,

1250
00:36:06,631 --> 00:36:09,120
wild west economics going on out there.

1251
00:36:09,270 --> 00:36:13,860
I lived in a super eight motel that a
girl rented like a floor of rooms out from

1252
00:36:13,861 --> 00:36:18,510
the super eight decorated them like on
some ace hotel shit and then rented them

1253
00:36:18,511 --> 00:36:20,100
out to foreigners and made more money.

1254
00:36:20,370 --> 00:36:23,610
And then there's an office building
that's a converted super eight room right

1255
00:36:23,611 --> 00:36:24,151
next to me.

1256
00:36:24,151 --> 00:36:26,790
Like there's this weird
Kooky stuff going on.

1257
00:36:26,791 --> 00:36:31,200
There's not as much regulation and it's
kind of cool to see because there is,

1258
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:33,210
they don't have the freedom of Internet.

1259
00:36:33,211 --> 00:36:34,920
They don't have that federal
freedom like we have,

1260
00:36:34,921 --> 00:36:38,610
but they do have this like
local freedom that is very,

1261
00:36:38,611 --> 00:36:39,900
very interesting for me to see.

1262
00:36:40,230 --> 00:36:41,640
Do they have an intranet?

1263
00:36:41,670 --> 00:36:43,260
Like an inner Chinese nat?

1264
00:36:43,410 --> 00:36:43,830
Yeah,

1265
00:36:43,830 --> 00:36:45,570
China's kind of strategy is,

1266
00:36:45,600 --> 00:36:45,961
look,

1267
00:36:45,961 --> 00:36:47,520
there's apple everywhere.

1268
00:36:47,550 --> 00:36:49,440
We're going to have our own bootleg apple.

1269
00:36:49,470 --> 00:36:52,200
We're going to have our own
way ball like bootleg Twitter.

1270
00:36:52,440 --> 00:36:54,480
We have our own telecom businesses,

1271
00:36:54,840 --> 00:36:55,531
their ideas.

1272
00:36:55,531 --> 00:36:57,060
We have this many people.

1273
00:36:57,090 --> 00:36:58,710
If we just keep the money in the country,

1274
00:36:58,711 --> 00:36:59,550
we're going to be fine.

1275
00:36:59,910 --> 00:37:01,260
So that's what they do.

1276
00:37:01,261 --> 00:37:02,820
They have all their own stuff.

1277
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:03,691
Is it as effective?

1278
00:37:03,691 --> 00:37:04,500
Absolutely not.

1279
00:37:04,500 --> 00:37:05,610
None of it runs as well.

1280
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:06,540
We know.

1281
00:37:06,540 --> 00:37:07,081
No crazy.

1282
00:37:07,081 --> 00:37:07,431
That is it.

1283
00:37:07,431 --> 00:37:10,800
Everything they do is a copy
that's so fucking strange.

1284
00:37:10,890 --> 00:37:13,890
They're copying entire
cities like down to the,

1285
00:37:14,100 --> 00:37:15,660
the stains on the marble.

1286
00:37:15,700 --> 00:37:18,600
Why tell Toby America creates things.

1287
00:37:18,601 --> 00:37:21,300
China copies things and then Japan
turns them into stuffed animals.

1288
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:24,480
It is weird though.

1289
00:37:24,481 --> 00:37:29,481
Like what is it psychologically that
makes a culture be responsible for so much

1290
00:37:30,091 --> 00:37:30,900
duplicate?

1291
00:37:30,900 --> 00:37:32,150
It's probably because that's how they,

1292
00:37:32,590 --> 00:37:33,401
they made their money.

1293
00:37:33,401 --> 00:37:34,070
That's the goal.

1294
00:37:34,070 --> 00:37:34,903
Why,

1295
00:37:35,030 --> 00:37:35,750
why,

1296
00:37:35,750 --> 00:37:36,071
what,

1297
00:37:36,071 --> 00:37:37,130
what caused that?

1298
00:37:37,131 --> 00:37:40,490
What was the trigger that made them not,

1299
00:37:40,850 --> 00:37:43,550
not have anything that
they're creating themselves,

1300
00:37:43,880 --> 00:37:45,890
that they're duplicating
so many different things.

1301
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:47,720
You don't need to be creative there.

1302
00:37:47,721 --> 00:37:48,260
Cause it's a,

1303
00:37:48,260 --> 00:37:48,740
it's,

1304
00:37:48,740 --> 00:37:50,180
it stems from a peasant culture,

1305
00:37:50,210 --> 00:37:51,140
peasant revolution.

1306
00:37:51,170 --> 00:37:53,090
People can't afford the real thing.

1307
00:37:53,091 --> 00:37:54,710
So as a business president,

1308
00:37:54,711 --> 00:37:58,850
all you have to do is create that
product at the proper price point in this

1309
00:37:58,851 --> 00:37:59,684
civilization.

1310
00:37:59,750 --> 00:37:59,961
Yeah,

1311
00:37:59,961 --> 00:38:01,820
because it's manufacturing.

1312
00:38:01,821 --> 00:38:04,610
So basically you would go over there,

1313
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:07,880
you would give them the IP or
the technology or whatever.

1314
00:38:07,881 --> 00:38:10,400
And say make this thing and
then they would make it,

1315
00:38:10,430 --> 00:38:10,700
you know,

1316
00:38:10,700 --> 00:38:15,050
nine to five and then five to nine they're
making the number twos to send tell

1317
00:38:15,051 --> 00:38:17,210
sell to India or Southeast
Asia or wherever else.

1318
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:20,840
So that's what the whole
economy is based on.

1319
00:38:21,230 --> 00:38:22,310
And then if you look at,

1320
00:38:22,311 --> 00:38:25,700
actually the interesting one is
actually pcs because it was like HP,

1321
00:38:25,940 --> 00:38:26,631
Ibm,

1322
00:38:26,631 --> 00:38:27,380
Dell,

1323
00:38:27,380 --> 00:38:32,380
and we all manufactured them in China
and then all of a sudden Lenovo and Acer

1324
00:38:33,290 --> 00:38:35,000
and all these companies became the big,

1325
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:40,280
and it's because the factories just took
the technology from like a Dell put it

1326
00:38:40,481 --> 00:38:44,530
out six months before Dow and
then at like not for 99 bucks.

1327
00:38:44,770 --> 00:38:49,770
And so del couldn't compete with their
own factory because they just took the

1328
00:38:50,020 --> 00:38:51,400
shit and sold it for much cheaper.

1329
00:38:51,460 --> 00:38:55,300
So they just took the design and recreated
it and just didn't call it a Dell.

1330
00:38:55,540 --> 00:38:56,240
Correct.

1331
00:38:56,240 --> 00:38:57,580
It is kind of smart though.

1332
00:38:57,690 --> 00:38:57,990
Yeah,

1333
00:38:57,990 --> 00:38:58,721
it's super scary.

1334
00:38:58,721 --> 00:38:59,111
Smart.

1335
00:38:59,111 --> 00:38:59,381
Sure.

1336
00:38:59,381 --> 00:39:01,540
If you could just steal people's ideas.

1337
00:39:01,541 --> 00:39:02,374
It's smart.

1338
00:39:02,950 --> 00:39:03,221
Yeah,

1339
00:39:03,221 --> 00:39:04,054
it's in a,

1340
00:39:04,150 --> 00:39:05,320
I always feel this way.

1341
00:39:05,350 --> 00:39:05,980
If,

1342
00:39:05,980 --> 00:39:10,210
if people in China spent as much time
trying to create something new as they do

1343
00:39:10,211 --> 00:39:11,020
copying,

1344
00:39:11,020 --> 00:39:12,790
it'd be probably in a better place.

1345
00:39:12,910 --> 00:39:13,450
Right.

1346
00:39:13,450 --> 00:39:14,410
Cause they even have like,

1347
00:39:14,440 --> 00:39:16,600
it's an interesting cycle.

1348
00:39:16,930 --> 00:39:17,411
Restaurants,

1349
00:39:17,411 --> 00:39:18,760
we cycle oil,

1350
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:19,270
you know,

1351
00:39:19,270 --> 00:39:22,630
there's just so many things
they do to get around.

1352
00:39:22,660 --> 00:39:23,261
Like Roman,

1353
00:39:23,261 --> 00:39:25,210
there was that fake lion in the zoo.

1354
00:39:25,211 --> 00:39:27,780
They put the Tibet and dog and
the zoo and called it a lion.

1355
00:39:28,340 --> 00:39:28,700
Have you,

1356
00:39:28,700 --> 00:39:29,480
have you ever heard of it?

1357
00:39:29,480 --> 00:39:30,380
But have you heard the big,

1358
00:39:30,381 --> 00:39:32,990
the big story out of China and
out of the fake food story?

1359
00:39:33,430 --> 00:39:33,740
Why?

1360
00:39:33,740 --> 00:39:34,490
Which one?

1361
00:39:34,490 --> 00:39:35,241
So you know they,

1362
00:39:35,241 --> 00:39:35,451
they,

1363
00:39:35,451 --> 00:39:40,160
they keep finding like eggs now that
are totally synthetic eggs and they have

1364
00:39:40,161 --> 00:39:40,840
the,

1365
00:39:40,840 --> 00:39:41,673
the,

1366
00:39:41,710 --> 00:39:43,890
the pork that they put under
the thing and it's good.

1367
00:39:44,020 --> 00:39:45,380
It was fluorescent blue.

1368
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:45,711
Yeah.

1369
00:39:45,711 --> 00:39:46,100
I heard.

1370
00:39:46,100 --> 00:39:46,350
Yeah.

1371
00:39:46,350 --> 00:39:47,810
And then they have the created week.

1372
00:39:47,840 --> 00:39:52,430
Like basically they have a food issue so
that they've come up with and I'm like,

1373
00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:52,760
Whoa,

1374
00:39:52,760 --> 00:39:53,121
hold on.

1375
00:39:53,121 --> 00:39:54,530
Eggs aren't fucking expensive.

1376
00:39:54,531 --> 00:39:55,940
I mean you get a chicken lays eggs.

1377
00:39:55,941 --> 00:39:56,774
Like,

1378
00:39:56,920 --> 00:40:00,910
isn't it more expensive to make a fake
egg out of chemicals and make a fake egg

1379
00:40:00,911 --> 00:40:02,990
shell and shit and so much effort,

1380
00:40:03,020 --> 00:40:04,050
effort to shift from a,

1381
00:40:04,060 --> 00:40:05,780
does it have a fake eggs?

1382
00:40:05,870 --> 00:40:07,010
So why are they doing it then?

1383
00:40:07,640 --> 00:40:08,780
Cause there's not enough eggs.

1384
00:40:09,700 --> 00:40:09,871
No,

1385
00:40:09,871 --> 00:40:10,170
nothing.

1386
00:40:10,170 --> 00:40:12,360
So they're making some
sort of synthetic egg.

1387
00:40:12,361 --> 00:40:13,194
Got a what?

1388
00:40:13,610 --> 00:40:14,443
Chemicals.

1389
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:15,340
What kind of drew?

1390
00:40:15,340 --> 00:40:16,110
Look it up online.

1391
00:40:16,110 --> 00:40:16,830
Look up,

1392
00:40:16,830 --> 00:40:19,250
look up a fake Chinese fake food.

1393
00:40:19,251 --> 00:40:20,870
There's all kinds of
stories coming out now.

1394
00:40:20,920 --> 00:40:21,110
Yeah.

1395
00:40:21,110 --> 00:40:23,030
And if you just Google
food safety in China,

1396
00:40:23,031 --> 00:40:23,864
it's horrific.

1397
00:40:24,910 --> 00:40:25,470
It's fat.

1398
00:40:25,470 --> 00:40:25,910
It's sad.

1399
00:40:25,910 --> 00:40:28,580
I feel bad for the Peter's
better fake food scandal.

1400
00:40:28,581 --> 00:40:29,480
Rocks China.

1401
00:40:29,540 --> 00:40:30,373
Yeah.

1402
00:40:30,890 --> 00:40:31,723
Wow.

1403
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:34,370
How to make a rotten egg thing.

1404
00:40:34,371 --> 00:40:36,230
I would tell people those
when I read these stories,

1405
00:40:36,231 --> 00:40:36,471
I'm like,

1406
00:40:36,471 --> 00:40:38,000
don't judge the people.

1407
00:40:38,420 --> 00:40:39,140
They're like,

1408
00:40:39,140 --> 00:40:42,560
they're uninformed and they kind of in
a lot of ways don't even have a chance

1409
00:40:42,561 --> 00:40:43,080
against this.

1410
00:40:43,080 --> 00:40:45,200
Like I hung out with the
locals there and they're like,

1411
00:40:45,201 --> 00:40:45,381
look,

1412
00:40:45,381 --> 00:40:46,550
we know we're eating fake,

1413
00:40:46,610 --> 00:40:46,910
right?

1414
00:40:46,910 --> 00:40:48,590
We know we're eating recycled oil.

1415
00:40:48,591 --> 00:40:50,540
We know it's going to kill
us and it's bad for us.

1416
00:40:50,780 --> 00:40:53,780
But like we have no choice
like their government.

1417
00:40:53,781 --> 00:40:55,730
It's even harder to like effect on a f.

1418
00:40:55,760 --> 00:40:56,030
I mean,

1419
00:40:56,030 --> 00:40:57,530
you can't affect it on a federal level.

1420
00:40:59,160 --> 00:41:00,510
Prepare a mold.

1421
00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:02,400
They mix the right amount of resins,

1422
00:41:02,401 --> 00:41:03,030
starch,

1423
00:41:03,030 --> 00:41:06,060
coagulant and pigments
to make the eggs white.

1424
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:07,201
Uh,

1425
00:41:07,201 --> 00:41:12,201
sodium algernate extracted from
brown algae gives the egg white,

1426
00:41:12,511 --> 00:41:14,010
the wanted viscosity.

1427
00:41:14,250 --> 00:41:19,250
Then they add fake egg yolk from a
different mix of resin and pigments.

1428
00:41:19,500 --> 00:41:21,480
Once the proper shape is achieved.

1429
00:41:22,170 --> 00:41:27,170
And amalgamate of parafin was gypsum
powder and calcium carbonate makes for a

1430
00:41:28,711 --> 00:41:29,640
credible shell.

1431
00:41:29,700 --> 00:41:31,690
It sounds like it's like $100,000.

1432
00:41:31,691 --> 00:41:31,921
Right?

1433
00:41:31,921 --> 00:41:34,650
This is fucking insane.

1434
00:41:34,850 --> 00:41:36,350
This is fucking insane.

1435
00:41:36,970 --> 00:41:38,110
There's all kinds of stories.

1436
00:41:38,111 --> 00:41:39,610
Not today have fake eggs.

1437
00:41:40,090 --> 00:41:41,080
They have this crazy,

1438
00:41:41,081 --> 00:41:42,670
you should look up the pork one.

1439
00:41:42,671 --> 00:41:44,740
They have the fake wheat and the wheat is,

1440
00:41:44,741 --> 00:41:45,191
I believe,

1441
00:41:45,191 --> 00:41:46,510
actually poisonous.

1442
00:41:47,140 --> 00:41:47,720
Uh,

1443
00:41:47,720 --> 00:41:48,553
wow.

1444
00:41:48,730 --> 00:41:49,640
This is fun.

1445
00:41:49,860 --> 00:41:53,150
Says this and this is all just
because they have not enough food.

1446
00:41:54,360 --> 00:41:54,811
Yeah.

1447
00:41:54,811 --> 00:41:56,130
And I think it's just,

1448
00:41:56,250 --> 00:41:56,610
you know,

1449
00:41:56,610 --> 00:41:56,821
look,

1450
00:41:56,821 --> 00:41:58,020
it's again,

1451
00:41:58,021 --> 00:42:00,210
to go back to the hell
beautiful human beings are,

1452
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:01,740
it's a way to make money.

1453
00:42:01,770 --> 00:42:02,041
You know,

1454
00:42:02,041 --> 00:42:02,970
you have a factory,

1455
00:42:02,971 --> 00:42:03,870
you figure out the shit,

1456
00:42:04,110 --> 00:42:07,240
you manufacture millions of these
eggs at a paraffin calsl mate,

1457
00:42:07,790 --> 00:42:08,700
and you sell it,

1458
00:42:09,600 --> 00:42:14,600
including cases of pork colored to
be sold as beef pork that glowed blue

1459
00:42:16,020 --> 00:42:21,020
recycled steam buns and a
Tofu fermented with sewage.

1460
00:42:22,980 --> 00:42:24,390
Oh my God.

1461
00:42:24,540 --> 00:42:27,220
And this is just because there's just
no way to sustain that kind of a pocket

1462
00:42:27,230 --> 00:42:27,810
layers.

1463
00:42:27,810 --> 00:42:30,210
There's a lion in front of the zoo.

1464
00:42:30,780 --> 00:42:31,890
That's a real lion,

1465
00:42:31,891 --> 00:42:32,724
bro.

1466
00:42:33,380 --> 00:42:34,213
No lie.

1467
00:42:34,450 --> 00:42:35,160
I was like,

1468
00:42:35,160 --> 00:42:36,730
Beethoven didn't get a haircut.

1469
00:42:36,731 --> 00:42:37,770
So stupid.

1470
00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:39,180
They called that a lion.

1471
00:42:40,030 --> 00:42:41,190
Jesus Christ.

1472
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:43,770
What a weird fucking country.

1473
00:42:44,760 --> 00:42:45,900
And what do they do now?

1474
00:42:45,901 --> 00:42:46,141
I mean,

1475
00:42:46,141 --> 00:42:49,590
they're going to keep growing and they're
going to grow with more boys than they

1476
00:42:49,591 --> 00:42:50,424
are girls.

1477
00:42:50,490 --> 00:42:52,560
So if people are going to have kids,

1478
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:57,800
like how the fucker 50 million extra boy's
gonna find brides or boyfriends even.

1479
00:42:58,671 --> 00:42:58,780
Yeah.

1480
00:42:58,780 --> 00:42:59,381
But if you,

1481
00:42:59,381 --> 00:43:00,580
if you look at China,

1482
00:43:00,610 --> 00:43:01,850
if you look at China though,

1483
00:43:01,851 --> 00:43:01,990
it's,

1484
00:43:01,990 --> 00:43:04,300
it's interesting because
when I go to China,

1485
00:43:04,301 --> 00:43:04,931
go to China a lot,

1486
00:43:04,931 --> 00:43:09,070
I think this is what British
people must've felt like
when they came to America,

1487
00:43:09,730 --> 00:43:12,670
because you would use
a tool around America.

1488
00:43:12,671 --> 00:43:13,540
When you're from Britain,

1489
00:43:13,720 --> 00:43:14,553
it's bigger,

1490
00:43:14,680 --> 00:43:15,910
it's got more people,

1491
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:18,490
it's got all these factories
where they're making tons of shit.

1492
00:43:18,760 --> 00:43:20,530
And then you go back to
England and you're like,

1493
00:43:20,531 --> 00:43:22,240
well we got banking and you know,

1494
00:43:22,270 --> 00:43:22,841
you know when we don't,

1495
00:43:22,841 --> 00:43:24,330
we don't really build anything anymore.

1496
00:43:24,340 --> 00:43:25,450
And you could just see it coming.

1497
00:43:25,720 --> 00:43:26,650
And when you go to China,

1498
00:43:26,651 --> 00:43:27,610
they're just making shit.

1499
00:43:27,611 --> 00:43:31,390
They're making stuff and they're
selling stuff and they're building shit,

1500
00:43:31,670 --> 00:43:33,250
jumping off and going crazy.

1501
00:43:33,640 --> 00:43:34,350
But anyway,

1502
00:43:34,350 --> 00:43:35,080
there,

1503
00:43:35,080 --> 00:43:35,913
and they're there,

1504
00:43:35,940 --> 00:43:36,371
whatever,

1505
00:43:36,371 --> 00:43:37,480
three times the size.

1506
00:43:37,481 --> 00:43:38,710
So you sit there and you say,

1507
00:43:39,160 --> 00:43:39,551
yeah,

1508
00:43:39,551 --> 00:43:40,840
eventually they're going to get there,

1509
00:43:40,841 --> 00:43:41,441
they're going to win.

1510
00:43:41,441 --> 00:43:43,990
And then we're going to be
Great Britain sort of saying,

1511
00:43:44,930 --> 00:43:45,160
no,

1512
00:43:45,160 --> 00:43:46,420
we're going to be going around going,

1513
00:43:46,421 --> 00:43:49,510
well now we do banking and services
and it be like England's nice place and

1514
00:43:49,511 --> 00:43:50,020
everything.

1515
00:43:50,020 --> 00:43:50,141
Well,

1516
00:43:50,141 --> 00:43:51,550
we're not going to be number one anymore.

1517
00:43:52,450 --> 00:43:56,050
The military part of our number
one is the craziest part,

1518
00:43:56,051 --> 00:43:56,740
isn't it?

1519
00:43:56,740 --> 00:43:56,891
I mean,

1520
00:43:56,891 --> 00:43:57,640
as far as like,

1521
00:43:57,640 --> 00:43:59,260
well their military is much bigger,

1522
00:43:59,320 --> 00:44:01,690
but the thing is is we have the tech,

1523
00:44:01,720 --> 00:44:03,100
but they're going to have the tech soon.

1524
00:44:03,101 --> 00:44:03,934
Why?

1525
00:44:04,420 --> 00:44:05,440
Because we sell it to them.

1526
00:44:06,080 --> 00:44:06,950
Right.

1527
00:44:07,550 --> 00:44:08,430
Of course we sell it to them.

1528
00:44:08,930 --> 00:44:11,480
There's also that thing going on
at the South China seas though.

1529
00:44:11,481 --> 00:44:13,250
Like definitely Japan fighting primary.

1530
00:44:13,251 --> 00:44:16,160
He wants to militarize like
that's scary to what's going on.

1531
00:44:16,200 --> 00:44:16,381
Yeah.

1532
00:44:16,381 --> 00:44:17,160
But Japan,

1533
00:44:17,160 --> 00:44:20,130
that's just a bunch of posture
because Japan can't fuck with anybody.

1534
00:44:20,190 --> 00:44:23,010
I mean like this especially,

1535
00:44:23,011 --> 00:44:25,020
can't fuck with China and no
one could fuck with China.

1536
00:44:25,310 --> 00:44:25,850
Yeah.

1537
00:44:25,850 --> 00:44:27,010
So the South China seas,

1538
00:44:27,020 --> 00:44:31,070
China was telling people if you're going
to fly through this zone in the south

1539
00:44:31,080 --> 00:44:31,651
China seas,

1540
00:44:31,651 --> 00:44:32,130
this is our

1541
00:44:32,130 --> 00:44:32,963
territory.

1542
00:44:33,090 --> 00:44:36,090
You're going to notify us when
we fly through Japan was like,

1543
00:44:36,120 --> 00:44:38,760
we don't concede that
that's your territory,

1544
00:44:38,761 --> 00:44:39,690
nor does Korea.

1545
00:44:39,930 --> 00:44:42,030
And an America stepped in and was like,

1546
00:44:42,031 --> 00:44:42,331
you know,

1547
00:44:42,331 --> 00:44:45,150
we feel like there needs to be
some sort of compromise on this.

1548
00:44:45,151 --> 00:44:45,451
So it's,

1549
00:44:45,451 --> 00:44:47,400
it's a disputed issue right now.

1550
00:44:47,520 --> 00:44:50,850
I think Carrie just went over to
Japan to talk to them about the issue.

1551
00:44:50,851 --> 00:44:52,590
But have you been to China,

1552
00:44:52,591 --> 00:44:52,860
Joe?

1553
00:44:52,860 --> 00:44:53,460
No,

1554
00:44:53,460 --> 00:44:55,350
it honestly is pretty cool.

1555
00:44:55,380 --> 00:44:56,340
You should definitely go.

1556
00:44:56,341 --> 00:44:57,960
The people are amazing.

1557
00:44:58,380 --> 00:45:00,360
The government is on some other shit.

1558
00:45:01,110 --> 00:45:01,943
The government is awesome.

1559
00:45:01,980 --> 00:45:06,000
And the business people that run that
country do not give a fuck about humanity.

1560
00:45:06,570 --> 00:45:09,720
That's the problem isn't a case too.

1561
00:45:09,780 --> 00:45:10,440
I mean a,

1562
00:45:10,440 --> 00:45:12,500
I would assume at least that
when you get that amount,

1563
00:45:12,540 --> 00:45:13,440
that amount of people,

1564
00:45:13,441 --> 00:45:15,810
that it's sort of like a big cities,

1565
00:45:15,811 --> 00:45:16,680
how big cities,

1566
00:45:16,800 --> 00:45:20,400
people are not as valuable to each
other as they aren't small towns,

1567
00:45:20,520 --> 00:45:21,150
small towns.

1568
00:45:21,150 --> 00:45:23,490
People are a little bit kinder
to each other because they're,

1569
00:45:23,760 --> 00:45:24,091
you know,

1570
00:45:24,091 --> 00:45:27,000
they're dealing with a one on
one person on a regular basis.

1571
00:45:27,150 --> 00:45:28,230
Whereas in big cities,

1572
00:45:28,231 --> 00:45:28,361
you know,

1573
00:45:28,361 --> 00:45:28,490
he,

1574
00:45:28,490 --> 00:45:32,400
like I was talking about Jim Norton lives
in Manhattan and he jokes around about

1575
00:45:32,401 --> 00:45:36,720
how he lives in this big box filled
with people and he doesn't know anybody.

1576
00:45:37,110 --> 00:45:39,510
He has an apartment building he lives
and he doesn't know a single one of them.

1577
00:45:39,900 --> 00:45:42,090
And it's like people aren't as valuable.

1578
00:45:42,091 --> 00:45:43,050
They're not worth as much.

1579
00:45:43,320 --> 00:45:45,870
I wonder if that's the case
with a place like China.

1580
00:45:45,871 --> 00:45:48,000
It's just like when you got
a billion people that's,

1581
00:45:48,210 --> 00:45:48,661
they're not,

1582
00:45:48,661 --> 00:45:50,340
it's not like a precious resource.

1583
00:45:50,341 --> 00:45:51,810
It's like there's a burden.

1584
00:45:51,930 --> 00:45:54,300
The class divide is also so crazy,

1585
00:45:54,301 --> 00:45:57,690
so you don't come into contact
with someone of the lower class,

1586
00:45:57,691 --> 00:46:00,090
like the person that you're
dumping those goods on you.

1587
00:46:00,090 --> 00:46:01,380
You never meet that person.

1588
00:46:01,650 --> 00:46:03,030
Like when I lived in Chengdu,

1589
00:46:03,510 --> 00:46:05,370
there's less of that divide.

1590
00:46:05,371 --> 00:46:06,330
The divide is still there,

1591
00:46:06,331 --> 00:46:08,220
but you meet people
from all walks of life.

1592
00:46:08,430 --> 00:46:11,100
Even though that city is
becoming one of China's largest,

1593
00:46:11,550 --> 00:46:15,000
those people are in touch because
some of them were very poor.

1594
00:46:15,240 --> 00:46:16,650
They open small stores,

1595
00:46:16,651 --> 00:46:17,790
became lower,

1596
00:46:17,791 --> 00:46:19,290
lower middle class in China,

1597
00:46:19,590 --> 00:46:21,210
but they still remember what it was.

1598
00:46:21,240 --> 00:46:22,410
If you go to Shanghai,

1599
00:46:22,950 --> 00:46:23,910
it's like if you,

1600
00:46:24,300 --> 00:46:27,510
if I bring up an argument about
pollution or humanity or whatever,

1601
00:46:27,840 --> 00:46:28,710
they're really just like,

1602
00:46:28,720 --> 00:46:29,553
look,

1603
00:46:29,670 --> 00:46:31,200
this place is going to be polluted.

1604
00:46:31,560 --> 00:46:33,060
People are gonna eat fake food.

1605
00:46:33,061 --> 00:46:34,140
People are going to be sick,

1606
00:46:34,380 --> 00:46:37,890
but there's nothing I can do and I'm
going to get paid as much as I can until

1607
00:46:37,891 --> 00:46:40,740
I'm going to leave and nobody
wants to raise their kids there.

1608
00:46:41,100 --> 00:46:45,750
Everybody knows the environment is not
conducive to like raising kids is not

1609
00:46:45,751 --> 00:46:49,190
conducive to living and it's
getting worse than life's places.

1610
00:46:49,200 --> 00:46:53,820
Like third instructing pilots on how
to land in low visibility from Beijing.

1611
00:46:53,940 --> 00:46:55,470
If you spend a lot of time in Beijing,

1612
00:46:55,500 --> 00:46:56,550
you never see the sky.

1613
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:57,833
Yeah.

1614
00:46:57,900 --> 00:46:58,530
Ever.

1615
00:46:58,530 --> 00:47:01,350
Ever Yell God damn.

1616
00:47:01,351 --> 00:47:02,610
How bad is after your lungs?

1617
00:47:03,330 --> 00:47:04,440
I'm fairly horrible.

1618
00:47:04,470 --> 00:47:04,921
I mean they do.

1619
00:47:04,921 --> 00:47:06,180
How do you feel when you leave that?

1620
00:47:06,750 --> 00:47:07,321
It's tough,

1621
00:47:07,321 --> 00:47:07,591
man.

1622
00:47:07,591 --> 00:47:08,424
You can tell.

1623
00:47:08,610 --> 00:47:10,710
You can tell even the water
when you take a shower,

1624
00:47:10,711 --> 00:47:14,310
sometimes it leaves a
little like grayness behind.

1625
00:47:14,900 --> 00:47:15,733
It's bad.

1626
00:47:16,320 --> 00:47:17,153
It's bad.

1627
00:47:17,260 --> 00:47:20,190
Like how Eddie comes on the show
and we just bashed China for an hour

1628
00:47:22,290 --> 00:47:23,630
trying to figure out what it costs.

1629
00:47:24,240 --> 00:47:26,160
I just hope to like,

1630
00:47:26,250 --> 00:47:27,720
I mean I don't know how to do it.

1631
00:47:28,080 --> 00:47:28,980
I'm writing this book.

1632
00:47:29,080 --> 00:47:32,920
It's really hard to write the book
because you want the best for these people

1633
00:47:33,010 --> 00:47:36,880
and the people want like the people
know what they're being subjected to,

1634
00:47:36,881 --> 00:47:40,840
but I mean they don't have the freedom
to fly around and pick up and move

1635
00:47:40,841 --> 00:47:41,440
somewhere else.

1636
00:47:41,440 --> 00:47:41,581
Sure.

1637
00:47:41,581 --> 00:47:42,160
I mean,

1638
00:47:42,160 --> 00:47:45,940
they're kind of stuck where they
are and they're at the mercy of this

1639
00:47:45,941 --> 00:47:46,451
government,

1640
00:47:46,451 --> 00:47:47,110
this new,

1641
00:47:47,110 --> 00:47:48,970
this new pro chairman.

1642
00:47:48,971 --> 00:47:49,721
I forget what it's called,

1643
00:47:49,721 --> 00:47:50,321
president chairman,

1644
00:47:50,321 --> 00:47:50,561
whatever.

1645
00:47:50,561 --> 00:47:51,394
He's coming in,

1646
00:47:51,400 --> 00:47:55,660
he's doing a good job in terms of the
corruption and he's taking down people at

1647
00:47:55,661 --> 00:48:00,040
very high levels that were never
exposed to trial or inspection.

1648
00:48:00,280 --> 00:48:01,120
So that's good.

1649
00:48:01,121 --> 00:48:01,461
But you,

1650
00:48:01,461 --> 00:48:01,620
you,

1651
00:48:01,620 --> 00:48:03,820
you're just kind of skeptical as to,

1652
00:48:04,120 --> 00:48:04,953
is this,

1653
00:48:05,140 --> 00:48:08,560
is this just for a show or are you just
taking down a couple people who don't

1654
00:48:08,561 --> 00:48:12,250
matter or are you really gonna go after
this and turn this country around?

1655
00:48:12,251 --> 00:48:12,810
So who knows?

1656
00:48:12,810 --> 00:48:13,643
Sure.

1657
00:48:14,020 --> 00:48:14,710
Wow.

1658
00:48:14,710 --> 00:48:15,100
Yeah.

1659
00:48:15,100 --> 00:48:15,371
I mean,

1660
00:48:15,371 --> 00:48:17,020
I love the country and I loved the people.

1661
00:48:17,021 --> 00:48:18,280
It's just if you go to any,

1662
00:48:18,370 --> 00:48:19,960
if you go to any country,

1663
00:48:20,500 --> 00:48:21,490
people are nice.

1664
00:48:21,820 --> 00:48:22,550
Yeah.

1665
00:48:22,550 --> 00:48:22,930
Or,

1666
00:48:22,930 --> 00:48:23,760
or like you go,

1667
00:48:23,760 --> 00:48:24,950
go to someone's house and they say,

1668
00:48:24,951 --> 00:48:27,960
stay in my house and you need some lamb
and you fucking have a beer and they're

1669
00:48:27,961 --> 00:48:28,794
all fine.

1670
00:48:29,370 --> 00:48:30,810
But they could be at war,

1671
00:48:30,820 --> 00:48:31,050
but they,

1672
00:48:31,050 --> 00:48:34,050
you go to Afghany Afghany houses,

1673
00:48:34,051 --> 00:48:34,741
they're super nice.

1674
00:48:34,741 --> 00:48:34,831
You,

1675
00:48:34,831 --> 00:48:35,700
I was in Dagestan,

1676
00:48:35,701 --> 00:48:37,020
Everybody's super nice to you.

1677
00:48:37,530 --> 00:48:38,790
They want to kill you,

1678
00:48:39,270 --> 00:48:39,890
you know,

1679
00:48:39,890 --> 00:48:40,380
uh,

1680
00:48:40,380 --> 00:48:42,360
philosophically lower like your,

1681
00:48:42,390 --> 00:48:43,111
your country,

1682
00:48:43,111 --> 00:48:46,740
like Dagestan is basically
a terrorist university,

1683
00:48:47,250 --> 00:48:47,551
right?

1684
00:48:47,551 --> 00:48:48,384
Because

1685
00:48:50,460 --> 00:48:52,890
they've been trying to separate
from Russia for so long.

1686
00:48:53,310 --> 00:48:53,491
You know,

1687
00:48:53,491 --> 00:48:54,630
there's this war in Chechnya,

1688
00:48:54,631 --> 00:48:56,160
everybody came over to Dagestan.

1689
00:48:56,490 --> 00:49:00,570
So you have this small little country
that's continually at war with the

1690
00:49:00,571 --> 00:49:03,330
Russians and the Russians are
like sending the special forces,

1691
00:49:03,331 --> 00:49:04,380
the Spetsnaz down,

1692
00:49:04,710 --> 00:49:05,011
you know,

1693
00:49:05,011 --> 00:49:05,221
and,

1694
00:49:05,221 --> 00:49:08,130
and the Spetsnaz guys just kidnap
people and cut off their heads.

1695
00:49:08,131 --> 00:49:08,760
And so the,

1696
00:49:08,760 --> 00:49:10,230
because of this happening and like the,

1697
00:49:10,290 --> 00:49:12,030
the young men go into the forest,

1698
00:49:12,031 --> 00:49:12,864
quote unquote,

1699
00:49:12,960 --> 00:49:14,700
which is to join the insurgency.

1700
00:49:14,970 --> 00:49:19,830
And there's so many of them
that now they're surfacing
in Syria and Afghanistan,

1701
00:49:19,831 --> 00:49:20,670
here in America,

1702
00:49:20,671 --> 00:49:21,430
the Boston bombers,

1703
00:49:21,430 --> 00:49:26,040
when the older one time and then went
to Dagestan for six months before the

1704
00:49:26,041 --> 00:49:26,874
bombing.

1705
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:27,451
And,

1706
00:49:27,451 --> 00:49:28,284
um,

1707
00:49:28,290 --> 00:49:28,560
uh,

1708
00:49:28,560 --> 00:49:30,060
Russia obviously in,

1709
00:49:30,061 --> 00:49:30,271
in,

1710
00:49:30,271 --> 00:49:32,220
in Denmark and Czech Republic,

1711
00:49:32,221 --> 00:49:33,970
all these Dagestani terrorists are,

1712
00:49:33,971 --> 00:49:34,111
are,

1713
00:49:34,111 --> 00:49:35,370
are sort of coming out and it,

1714
00:49:35,670 --> 00:49:36,061
and you know,

1715
00:49:36,061 --> 00:49:36,661
it's because,

1716
00:49:36,661 --> 00:49:36,871
you know,

1717
00:49:36,871 --> 00:49:37,021
they're,

1718
00:49:37,021 --> 00:49:37,830
they're fighting for,

1719
00:49:37,830 --> 00:49:38,670
for global jihad,

1720
00:49:38,671 --> 00:49:39,630
for Global Sharia.

1721
00:49:40,010 --> 00:49:40,301
Uh,

1722
00:49:40,301 --> 00:49:40,620
and,

1723
00:49:40,620 --> 00:49:41,011
and they,

1724
00:49:41,011 --> 00:49:41,401
they,

1725
00:49:41,401 --> 00:49:41,731
they,

1726
00:49:41,731 --> 00:49:45,090
it's like a one way ticket to go and they
literally go into the forest and learn

1727
00:49:45,091 --> 00:49:48,330
from the best terrorist how to
be the best terrorists in the,

1728
00:49:48,331 --> 00:49:48,871
in the world.

1729
00:49:48,871 --> 00:49:49,940
And then they go around the world and,

1730
00:49:49,960 --> 00:49:50,180
and,

1731
00:49:50,180 --> 00:49:51,690
and commit their crimes.

1732
00:49:52,260 --> 00:49:52,950
Um,

1733
00:49:52,950 --> 00:49:53,790
but when I was there,

1734
00:49:53,791 --> 00:49:54,001
so,

1735
00:49:54,001 --> 00:49:55,230
so these people are,

1736
00:49:55,290 --> 00:49:57,870
are theoretically like,

1737
00:49:57,900 --> 00:49:58,681
they hate me,

1738
00:49:58,681 --> 00:49:58,890
you know,

1739
00:49:58,890 --> 00:50:00,300
cause I'm there with a camera and going,

1740
00:50:00,301 --> 00:50:01,890
where did the Boston bomber go?

1741
00:50:01,890 --> 00:50:02,461
And you know,

1742
00:50:02,461 --> 00:50:03,110
and so,

1743
00:50:03,110 --> 00:50:04,590
and so you think they would hate me,

1744
00:50:04,591 --> 00:50:05,041
but they're like,

1745
00:50:05,041 --> 00:50:05,551
come in,

1746
00:50:05,551 --> 00:50:05,821
you know,

1747
00:50:05,821 --> 00:50:06,760
fucking have lamb.

1748
00:50:07,080 --> 00:50:08,370
Our son was kidnapped,

1749
00:50:08,371 --> 00:50:08,581
you know,

1750
00:50:08,581 --> 00:50:10,470
my daughter became a black widow.

1751
00:50:10,980 --> 00:50:12,230
We want to tell you the story,

1752
00:50:12,240 --> 00:50:13,110
have some tea,

1753
00:50:13,111 --> 00:50:13,381
you know,

1754
00:50:13,381 --> 00:50:14,550
sit down and we want to tell you,

1755
00:50:14,551 --> 00:50:15,930
we want to tell you want to tell you.

1756
00:50:16,470 --> 00:50:20,010
But meanwhile the whole place
is basically sort of on this,

1757
00:50:21,210 --> 00:50:21,630
you know,

1758
00:50:21,630 --> 00:50:22,650
civil war,

1759
00:50:22,920 --> 00:50:24,390
that sort of bubbling.

1760
00:50:24,391 --> 00:50:25,350
And because of that,

1761
00:50:25,710 --> 00:50:25,981
you know,

1762
00:50:25,981 --> 00:50:26,950
it's just like you,

1763
00:50:26,990 --> 00:50:30,650
all the young men are just learning how
to fuck shit up and how to kill people,

1764
00:50:30,651 --> 00:50:31,011
et Cetera,

1765
00:50:31,011 --> 00:50:31,370
et cetera.

1766
00:50:31,370 --> 00:50:34,010
Is there anything to
it besides just terror?

1767
00:50:34,040 --> 00:50:35,390
Like when you meet these people?

1768
00:50:37,290 --> 00:50:37,600
I mean,

1769
00:50:37,600 --> 00:50:38,510
I've never met one.

1770
00:50:38,540 --> 00:50:40,130
I'm just curious like through your eyes,

1771
00:50:40,131 --> 00:50:40,964
what it's like.

1772
00:50:41,360 --> 00:50:43,670
Are they just like one layer?

1773
00:50:43,910 --> 00:50:45,200
It's incredibly simple.

1774
00:50:45,260 --> 00:50:46,580
It's incredibly simple.

1775
00:50:46,910 --> 00:50:49,220
We just did a thing called
children of the drones.

1776
00:50:49,221 --> 00:50:52,040
It's fucking fascinating
if I do say so myself,

1777
00:50:52,520 --> 00:50:53,200
but uh,

1778
00:50:53,200 --> 00:50:54,033
I don't know.

1779
00:50:54,140 --> 00:50:55,310
I'm not supposed to tell him these.

1780
00:50:55,320 --> 00:50:56,240
We haven't heard them yet.

1781
00:50:56,241 --> 00:50:57,110
But there's two things.

1782
00:50:57,111 --> 00:50:58,340
One was me and down there,

1783
00:50:58,341 --> 00:50:59,360
there was children and the drones,

1784
00:51:00,050 --> 00:51:03,110
what happens is you have a
brother or a cousin or whatever,

1785
00:51:03,111 --> 00:51:03,771
your best friend,

1786
00:51:03,771 --> 00:51:04,604
whatever it is,

1787
00:51:05,890 --> 00:51:07,520
he just disappeared one day.

1788
00:51:07,521 --> 00:51:08,354
He's just gone.

1789
00:51:08,810 --> 00:51:10,940
And because of the insurgency,

1790
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:13,160
the special forces can do
whatever the fuck they want.

1791
00:51:13,850 --> 00:51:15,800
And so they just,

1792
00:51:15,830 --> 00:51:16,280
Oh,

1793
00:51:16,280 --> 00:51:19,910
you don't look right or you went to this
mosque or you have a beard or I just

1794
00:51:19,911 --> 00:51:20,331
don't like you,

1795
00:51:20,331 --> 00:51:21,260
whatever the fuck it is.

1796
00:51:21,770 --> 00:51:22,760
And they kidnap you,

1797
00:51:22,790 --> 00:51:23,061
right?

1798
00:51:23,061 --> 00:51:24,800
And they kill you generally
are torture you or whatever.

1799
00:51:24,801 --> 00:51:25,634
You just disappear.

1800
00:51:25,910 --> 00:51:28,790
So imagine when you're 19 and
you're a hothead and your,

1801
00:51:28,810 --> 00:51:29,150
you know,

1802
00:51:29,150 --> 00:51:32,690
fucking want to fuck shit up whenever
and your best friend or your brother or

1803
00:51:32,691 --> 00:51:33,920
your dad or whatever it gets kidnapped,

1804
00:51:33,950 --> 00:51:34,850
what the fuck are you going to do?

1805
00:51:35,660 --> 00:51:36,141
You're going to say,

1806
00:51:36,141 --> 00:51:37,550
I'm going to fucking fuck shit up.

1807
00:51:38,330 --> 00:51:42,230
And then there's a whole bunch of guys
who are waiting for you in the forest.

1808
00:51:42,620 --> 00:51:43,401
Where do you go in there?

1809
00:51:43,401 --> 00:51:43,751
And they said,

1810
00:51:43,751 --> 00:51:47,360
here's a gun and I'm going to train you
how to build bombs and you're going to

1811
00:51:47,361 --> 00:51:48,810
go fucking low.

1812
00:51:48,811 --> 00:51:50,540
The motherfuckers up who killed your dad.

1813
00:51:51,110 --> 00:51:51,831
And it's just,

1814
00:51:51,831 --> 00:51:52,790
it's very simple.

1815
00:51:52,791 --> 00:51:55,190
Like everyone talks about
ideology or it's this or it's,

1816
00:51:55,191 --> 00:51:55,371
you know,

1817
00:51:55,371 --> 00:51:56,630
global tree or all this stuff.

1818
00:51:56,990 --> 00:51:58,520
The fact of matter is
they just killed your dad.

1819
00:51:58,521 --> 00:51:59,090
So you're going to then,

1820
00:51:59,090 --> 00:52:00,050
I mean I'm going to fuck you up.

1821
00:52:00,051 --> 00:52:04,160
And especially in these countries
where that's part of the culture.

1822
00:52:04,161 --> 00:52:06,530
Like if you blood on blood for blood,

1823
00:52:06,830 --> 00:52:08,480
same thing with children or the drones.

1824
00:52:08,600 --> 00:52:09,061
You know we,

1825
00:52:09,061 --> 00:52:09,350
we,

1826
00:52:09,350 --> 00:52:11,930
we became enamored with
drones because there's,

1827
00:52:11,990 --> 00:52:14,160
our boys don't get killed and you know,

1828
00:52:14,180 --> 00:52:15,690
we just send them in and they fucking,

1829
00:52:15,720 --> 00:52:18,050
there's no collateral
damage and all this stuff.

1830
00:52:18,050 --> 00:52:22,250
Surgical and of course
it's bullshit and you know,

1831
00:52:22,251 --> 00:52:25,190
there's lots of collateral damage and
these people know that computers are

1832
00:52:25,191 --> 00:52:28,400
basically killing their brothers and
their sisters and their dad and their mom.

1833
00:52:28,820 --> 00:52:30,380
So we went to Pakistan and we're like,

1834
00:52:30,381 --> 00:52:30,771
why are,

1835
00:52:30,771 --> 00:52:30,981
why,

1836
00:52:30,981 --> 00:52:31,730
what the fuck are we going?

1837
00:52:31,730 --> 00:52:33,410
Why is everybody joining the Taliban?

1838
00:52:33,411 --> 00:52:34,880
He was more Taliban in Pakistan.

1839
00:52:34,881 --> 00:52:37,670
Then there is in fucking
Afghanistan and you know,

1840
00:52:38,120 --> 00:52:39,350
the drones go,

1841
00:52:39,351 --> 00:52:43,040
they kill somebody family
and then the Taliban says,

1842
00:52:43,041 --> 00:52:45,980
see these fucking motherfuckers
are killing us by remote control.

1843
00:52:46,220 --> 00:52:51,220
And this one woman who runs a school to
d Taliban dudes is like for every drone

1844
00:52:52,461 --> 00:52:57,170
attack you have a hundred new recruits
to the Taliban and all of those a hundred

1845
00:52:57,171 --> 00:52:57,741
new recruits,

1846
00:52:57,741 --> 00:53:00,650
they will be suicide bombers
who will go to America,

1847
00:53:00,651 --> 00:53:04,160
who will go to American troops and
we'll fucking blow themselves up every

1848
00:53:04,161 --> 00:53:05,180
fucking drone attack.

1849
00:53:05,570 --> 00:53:06,500
And it's very simple.

1850
00:53:06,530 --> 00:53:07,700
You killed my dad,

1851
00:53:08,030 --> 00:53:09,170
I am now going to kill you.

1852
00:53:10,040 --> 00:53:13,280
So this imbalance in terms of warfare,

1853
00:53:13,310 --> 00:53:18,310
there's a yin and a Yang to life and
this imbalance is causing this massive

1854
00:53:19,050 --> 00:53:21,830
buildup that one day is
kind of slap us in the face.

1855
00:53:22,130 --> 00:53:27,130
We are training right now in Dagestan
and in Pakistan a hundred alcaide is one.

1856
00:53:27,550 --> 00:53:27,710
And,

1857
00:53:27,710 --> 00:53:32,710
and the irony is we went into
Afghanistan 11 years ago to to,

1858
00:53:33,410 --> 00:53:33,750
to,

1859
00:53:33,750 --> 00:53:34,090
to,

1860
00:53:34,090 --> 00:53:35,430
to take away the basis,

1861
00:53:35,431 --> 00:53:35,611
you know,

1862
00:53:35,611 --> 00:53:35,801
to,

1863
00:53:35,801 --> 00:53:35,971
to,

1864
00:53:35,971 --> 00:53:40,971
to get al Qaeda to get Taliban out because
of they were giving sanctuary to al

1865
00:53:41,040 --> 00:53:41,370
Qaeda.

1866
00:53:41,370 --> 00:53:43,980
And now because of the
process that we're doing,

1867
00:53:44,370 --> 00:53:46,110
we're making a hundred more al-Qaeda's.

1868
00:53:47,090 --> 00:53:47,751
It's it and,

1869
00:53:47,751 --> 00:53:51,540
and the sort of whole
cyclical thing is staggering.

1870
00:53:52,380 --> 00:53:53,490
It's fucking bananas,

1871
00:53:53,491 --> 00:53:53,790
man.

1872
00:53:53,790 --> 00:53:55,290
That's such a crazy statistic.

1873
00:53:55,291 --> 00:53:57,600
If you really think about the
possibility that that's true.

1874
00:53:57,601 --> 00:54:01,470
100 for every drawing attack and there's
a lot of goddamn drone attacks and the

1875
00:54:01,471 --> 00:54:03,810
number of people that are
killed that are civilians.

1876
00:54:03,960 --> 00:54:04,770
It's pretty high.

1877
00:54:04,770 --> 00:54:05,130
Yeah.

1878
00:54:05,130 --> 00:54:05,400
This,

1879
00:54:05,400 --> 00:54:06,780
this may sound stupid shame,

1880
00:54:06,860 --> 00:54:08,370
but I'm just curious,

1881
00:54:08,940 --> 00:54:10,530
is this for these people,

1882
00:54:10,531 --> 00:54:13,020
like it's purely just hate and revenge.

1883
00:54:13,021 --> 00:54:15,030
Like if they somehow came to power,

1884
00:54:15,060 --> 00:54:15,690
let's say,

1885
00:54:15,690 --> 00:54:20,460
like what is the objective is that it is
the objective just to make other people

1886
00:54:20,461 --> 00:54:23,790
feel the pain that they felt
from these drone attacks or,

1887
00:54:24,580 --> 00:54:25,110
I mean,

1888
00:54:25,110 --> 00:54:25,531
well there's,

1889
00:54:25,531 --> 00:54:27,090
there's not trying to
give like credibility,

1890
00:54:27,420 --> 00:54:28,790
ideological stuff and there's,

1891
00:54:28,810 --> 00:54:29,370
and there's,

1892
00:54:29,370 --> 00:54:30,840
there's philosophy obviously,

1893
00:54:31,380 --> 00:54:35,130
but the majority of it is
young men by and large.

1894
00:54:35,280 --> 00:54:39,480
And now in Dagestan more and
more women whose families,

1895
00:54:39,481 --> 00:54:40,051
husbands,

1896
00:54:40,051 --> 00:54:40,500
wives.

1897
00:54:40,500 --> 00:54:43,110
I know if you fucking kidnapped
my wife and killed her,

1898
00:54:43,290 --> 00:54:44,130
I would go ape shit.

1899
00:54:44,220 --> 00:54:45,330
If you kidnap my kids,

1900
00:54:45,610 --> 00:54:50,190
if a computer fucking model
airplane killed my children,

1901
00:54:50,580 --> 00:54:52,530
I would blow the fucking shit up.

1902
00:54:52,531 --> 00:54:53,970
I would go fucking ape shit.

1903
00:54:54,330 --> 00:54:58,170
So it's not unnatural for them to do that.

1904
00:54:58,230 --> 00:54:58,801
To say I'm,

1905
00:54:58,801 --> 00:55:01,890
and especially if you're young and you
don't have a future and you know a lot of

1906
00:55:01,891 --> 00:55:03,430
them are literate and
are told by their rules,

1907
00:55:03,450 --> 00:55:03,871
you know what?

1908
00:55:03,871 --> 00:55:06,030
You're going to go to heaven
if you blow yourself up.

1909
00:55:06,040 --> 00:55:06,601
You're like,

1910
00:55:06,601 --> 00:55:08,700
this is a good thing if
you go attack these guys.

1911
00:55:09,240 --> 00:55:11,070
And so it's not like they're
going to get in trouble.

1912
00:55:11,071 --> 00:55:14,940
It's not like they're going to go to
jail or any of this shit because they're

1913
00:55:14,941 --> 00:55:16,560
going to die and then they're
going to go to heaven.

1914
00:55:16,830 --> 00:55:17,910
So there's all that stuff.

1915
00:55:17,970 --> 00:55:19,590
What wrapped up into it too.

1916
00:55:19,770 --> 00:55:21,810
What happens when civilians are killed?

1917
00:55:21,840 --> 00:55:22,371
When I know,

1918
00:55:22,371 --> 00:55:22,681
I'm sorry,

1919
00:55:22,681 --> 00:55:23,041
I'm sorry.

1920
00:55:23,041 --> 00:55:27,660
One other thing is if you had a
bunch of Taliban invade America,

1921
00:55:28,080 --> 00:55:28,261
you know,

1922
00:55:28,261 --> 00:55:29,270
with long beards and,

1923
00:55:29,280 --> 00:55:29,581
and,

1924
00:55:29,581 --> 00:55:29,871
and,

1925
00:55:29,871 --> 00:55:31,020
and sort of turbans,

1926
00:55:31,830 --> 00:55:35,430
how many Americans would fight to
the death to get those guys out?

1927
00:55:35,610 --> 00:55:35,851
I mean,

1928
00:55:35,851 --> 00:55:36,360
we've seen it.

1929
00:55:36,360 --> 00:55:37,590
All we would need is Texas.

1930
00:55:38,940 --> 00:55:39,661
But I'm just saying,

1931
00:55:39,661 --> 00:55:40,980
so you have that alarmed,

1932
00:55:41,100 --> 00:55:44,220
you have that and everyone
would fight to the death.

1933
00:55:44,221 --> 00:55:45,210
And so you're like,

1934
00:55:45,211 --> 00:55:45,361
well,

1935
00:55:45,361 --> 00:55:46,500
that's what they're doing.

1936
00:55:46,501 --> 00:55:47,311
They're like,

1937
00:55:47,311 --> 00:55:48,144
we are.

1938
00:55:48,240 --> 00:55:49,073
We are in,

1939
00:55:49,230 --> 00:55:52,140
like we invade them and
then occupied their country.

1940
00:55:52,560 --> 00:55:53,281
So they're just saying,

1941
00:55:53,281 --> 00:55:54,660
I'm going to kill you just for that,

1942
00:55:54,661 --> 00:55:55,690
let alone go to heaven,

1943
00:55:55,710 --> 00:55:57,090
let alone the fact that
you killed my brother.

1944
00:55:57,950 --> 00:55:58,650
Wow.

1945
00:55:58,650 --> 00:55:59,250
And there's no,

1946
00:55:59,250 --> 00:55:59,640
I mean,

1947
00:55:59,640 --> 00:56:03,030
how do you argue against that if you
killed a bunch of people that actually our

1948
00:56:03,031 --> 00:56:03,690
innocence,

1949
00:56:03,690 --> 00:56:07,350
what I was gonna say is what's the process
when innocence or killed by drones?

1950
00:56:07,380 --> 00:56:07,801
Is there?

1951
00:56:07,801 --> 00:56:08,461
Apologies.

1952
00:56:08,461 --> 00:56:09,271
Did they get paid?

1953
00:56:09,271 --> 00:56:09,780
No.

1954
00:56:09,780 --> 00:56:10,510
No.

1955
00:56:10,510 --> 00:56:10,801
And,

1956
00:56:10,801 --> 00:56:13,470
and the other thing that's
interesting about that is,

1957
00:56:13,770 --> 00:56:17,040
so we interviewed the drone pilots and
they were like crying and I killed people

1958
00:56:17,041 --> 00:56:18,210
and it fucked me up.

1959
00:56:18,600 --> 00:56:19,291
And then you,

1960
00:56:19,291 --> 00:56:20,820
we interviewed the kids
and they're crying,

1961
00:56:20,821 --> 00:56:22,700
everybody's crying and so you're,

1962
00:56:22,760 --> 00:56:22,980
you're,

1963
00:56:22,980 --> 00:56:23,510
you know,

1964
00:56:23,510 --> 00:56:23,710
and,

1965
00:56:23,710 --> 00:56:24,420
and then,

1966
00:56:24,420 --> 00:56:26,350
then we interviewed Taliban kids who,

1967
00:56:26,560 --> 00:56:28,780
who joined the Taliban and they were like,

1968
00:56:29,230 --> 00:56:29,620
you know,

1969
00:56:29,620 --> 00:56:31,060
there has to be recompense.

1970
00:56:31,061 --> 00:56:33,760
You can't just fucking kill
us all the fucking time.

1971
00:56:34,120 --> 00:56:35,690
And so they joined the
Taliban and they're just,

1972
00:56:35,740 --> 00:56:38,050
they will fuck up anything
with an American flag.

1973
00:56:38,080 --> 00:56:38,913
And it's,

1974
00:56:39,040 --> 00:56:39,520
and look,

1975
00:56:39,520 --> 00:56:39,660
no,

1976
00:56:39,660 --> 00:56:40,451
I understand.

1977
00:56:40,451 --> 00:56:41,430
I understand it though.

1978
00:56:41,710 --> 00:56:42,650
Even if you paid in,

1979
00:56:42,651 --> 00:56:43,451
there's recompense like,

1980
00:56:43,451 --> 00:56:43,631
hey,

1981
00:56:43,631 --> 00:56:44,360
I killed your mom,

1982
00:56:44,360 --> 00:56:45,340
I built you a house.

1983
00:56:45,341 --> 00:56:46,540
Like who the fuck's gonna live in it?

1984
00:56:47,290 --> 00:56:48,123
Right.

1985
00:56:48,190 --> 00:56:49,630
I don't think there's anything you can do.

1986
00:56:49,631 --> 00:56:52,740
Like the drone strikes is just actionable.

1987
00:56:52,960 --> 00:56:54,190
They're totally unconscionable.

1988
00:56:54,191 --> 00:56:58,030
But once there has been casualties
and those casualties or ignored,

1989
00:56:58,450 --> 00:57:01,930
that almost seems like a strategy
to try to fuel the enemy.

1990
00:57:02,170 --> 00:57:04,390
I mean it really almost
seems so short sighted.

1991
00:57:04,690 --> 00:57:04,901
You know,

1992
00:57:04,901 --> 00:57:06,600
we can chalk it off to incompetence,

1993
00:57:06,730 --> 00:57:08,110
which is most likely that.

1994
00:57:08,530 --> 00:57:12,490
But if you can't look at the consequences
of that in competence and see that

1995
00:57:12,491 --> 00:57:14,430
this is going to cause
a bunch of people cheap,

1996
00:57:14,870 --> 00:57:16,630
then you don't have to train the pilot.

1997
00:57:16,810 --> 00:57:18,130
You don't have to have a big jet.

1998
00:57:18,131 --> 00:57:18,530
It's just a,

1999
00:57:18,530 --> 00:57:21,560
it's a cheap little drone that has
missiles or machine going on wants.

2000
00:57:21,670 --> 00:57:24,370
What we see is he can common with
everything we've talked about,

2001
00:57:24,371 --> 00:57:25,181
global warming,

2002
00:57:25,181 --> 00:57:25,780
fake food.

2003
00:57:25,780 --> 00:57:29,380
Everybody just wants to pass the bill
to the next generation and the next

2004
00:57:29,381 --> 00:57:31,060
generation because they figured,

2005
00:57:31,061 --> 00:57:32,710
well I don't have to deal
with these people right now.

2006
00:57:33,100 --> 00:57:33,341
Yeah.

2007
00:57:33,341 --> 00:57:33,610
Well,

2008
00:57:33,610 --> 00:57:35,350
and also what they don't realize is,

2009
00:57:35,410 --> 00:57:36,071
well fuck it,

2010
00:57:36,071 --> 00:57:37,000
it's in Pakistan.

2011
00:57:37,060 --> 00:57:38,200
They can't come get me here.

2012
00:57:38,470 --> 00:57:40,450
And as we've learned from al Qaeda,

2013
00:57:40,510 --> 00:57:42,370
they fucking cat and they will,

2014
00:57:42,450 --> 00:57:45,210
oh Jesus fucking Christ.

2015
00:57:45,540 --> 00:57:46,470
Are there answers Shane?

2016
00:57:46,970 --> 00:57:47,803
Well,

2017
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:48,450
but I,

2018
00:57:48,450 --> 00:57:49,690
I look it,

2019
00:57:49,810 --> 00:57:51,820
the first thing is to know
what the problems are.

2020
00:57:52,450 --> 00:57:53,290
And then once we,

2021
00:57:53,320 --> 00:57:55,600
this is why global warming
everything at somebody.

2022
00:57:55,601 --> 00:57:56,590
And even by the way,

2023
00:57:56,620 --> 00:57:58,840
even if global warming isn't true,

2024
00:57:58,870 --> 00:57:59,471
which it is,

2025
00:57:59,471 --> 00:58:00,460
but even if it isn't,

2026
00:58:00,940 --> 00:58:01,331
and I,

2027
00:58:01,331 --> 00:58:04,010
and I say this to the climate
change deniers all the time,

2028
00:58:04,011 --> 00:58:04,270
I'm like,

2029
00:58:04,270 --> 00:58:09,270
even if it's a five fucking percent
chance that this is all going to fucking

2030
00:58:10,301 --> 00:58:11,470
fuck up and we're all going to die,

2031
00:58:11,920 --> 00:58:15,820
don't you want to hedge your bets rather
than you saying this for sure is not

2032
00:58:15,821 --> 00:58:16,330
happening.

2033
00:58:16,330 --> 00:58:17,950
Even if there's a 1% chance,

2034
00:58:17,951 --> 00:58:22,090
don't you want to fucking hedge your bets
just as a smart fucking person anyway.

2035
00:58:22,690 --> 00:58:23,560
But first of all,

2036
00:58:23,561 --> 00:58:25,660
you have to say what is the problem?

2037
00:58:26,050 --> 00:58:26,801
And by the way,

2038
00:58:26,801 --> 00:58:27,311
as humans,

2039
00:58:27,311 --> 00:58:28,600
we don't want to say what is the problem?

2040
00:58:28,600 --> 00:58:29,680
We have to say what is the problem?

2041
00:58:29,860 --> 00:58:31,240
And then you can say let's fix it.

2042
00:58:31,270 --> 00:58:32,051
For example,

2043
00:58:32,051 --> 00:58:34,660
and I don't know if I've told this
story and you can stop me if I have,

2044
00:58:34,661 --> 00:58:37,720
but one of the most interesting
things I did recently is I went to the

2045
00:58:37,721 --> 00:58:39,130
Zeitgeists conference,

2046
00:58:39,131 --> 00:58:43,690
which is the Google conference and they
had this kid there who's like 18 years

2047
00:58:43,691 --> 00:58:48,691
old and he built the first reactor in his
garage when he was like 13 and he came

2048
00:58:49,361 --> 00:58:52,630
up with this way of
finding a like radioactive,

2049
00:58:52,631 --> 00:58:53,830
like it's like a Geiger counter,

2050
00:58:53,831 --> 00:58:56,760
but they do it with like a
water is the basis of that.

2051
00:58:57,280 --> 00:58:59,320
So it's so big that
they can do like ports.

2052
00:58:59,980 --> 00:59:00,750
If they were,

2053
00:59:00,750 --> 00:59:01,300
you know,

2054
00:59:01,300 --> 00:59:02,340
tankers with uh,

2055
00:59:02,740 --> 00:59:06,100
illegal radioactive material they
could figure out out in these ports.

2056
00:59:06,101 --> 00:59:07,030
This kid came up with him,

2057
00:59:07,031 --> 00:59:07,864
he was 16,

2058
00:59:08,050 --> 00:59:09,460
his new technology,

2059
00:59:09,580 --> 00:59:09,790
uh,

2060
00:59:09,790 --> 00:59:10,480
that he was pitching.

2061
00:59:10,480 --> 00:59:13,930
And by the way my jaw was
dropping is to take all the,

2062
00:59:13,931 --> 00:59:16,780
spent a radioactive fuel,

2063
00:59:16,781 --> 00:59:16,961
you know,

2064
00:59:16,961 --> 00:59:18,340
the shit that we can't dispose of,

2065
00:59:18,341 --> 00:59:19,930
its got 50,000 year shelf life.

2066
00:59:19,931 --> 00:59:21,800
We can only guarantee
safety for a hundred years.

2067
00:59:22,160 --> 00:59:24,710
All the spent fuel from all our reactors.

2068
00:59:25,250 --> 00:59:26,810
He's got this technology that,

2069
00:59:26,930 --> 00:59:28,640
that he can theoretically,

2070
00:59:28,641 --> 00:59:29,240
and I dunno,

2071
00:59:29,240 --> 00:59:29,361
I,

2072
00:59:29,361 --> 00:59:29,630
you know,

2073
00:59:29,630 --> 00:59:31,970
I haven't verified this cause
I'm not a nuclear physicist,

2074
00:59:32,360 --> 00:59:37,360
but he can take that spent fuel power his
failsafe reactors that cannot whatever

2075
00:59:37,880 --> 00:59:41,340
be bad down to where they have no uh,

2076
00:59:41,360 --> 00:59:43,490
radiation left in them cause cause the,

2077
00:59:43,491 --> 00:59:44,301
the fuel rods,

2078
00:59:44,301 --> 00:59:45,590
we actually only use like 90,

2079
00:59:45,810 --> 00:59:46,310
sorry,

2080
00:59:46,310 --> 00:59:46,941
7%.

2081
00:59:46,941 --> 00:59:49,340
So there's 93% left in them when we,

2082
00:59:49,400 --> 00:59:50,990
when we put them away and that,

2083
00:59:51,220 --> 00:59:53,910
so he can take them down
to when they're benign and,

2084
00:59:53,940 --> 00:59:56,030
and fuel the world for
the next 20,000 years.

2085
00:59:56,031 --> 00:59:56,780
And I'm like,

2086
00:59:56,780 --> 00:59:57,501
and by the way,

2087
00:59:57,501 --> 00:59:58,130
I believed it,

2088
00:59:58,130 --> 00:59:59,330
but even if it's bullshit,

2089
01:00:00,080 --> 01:00:02,940
like that's the technology
we should be going for.

2090
01:00:02,940 --> 01:00:04,550
That's the kind of shit
that we should be saying.

2091
01:00:04,551 --> 01:00:05,384
Yes please.

2092
01:00:05,570 --> 01:00:09,650
Let's take all the fucking bad evil shit
that we buried in the ground that we

2093
01:00:09,651 --> 01:00:10,880
can't even take that up.

2094
01:00:11,360 --> 01:00:16,130
Power these reactors and have 20,000
years of fucking energy doesn't have it.

2095
01:00:16,131 --> 01:00:17,300
We should pursue the exact,

2096
01:00:17,301 --> 01:00:18,740
how much science has been done.

2097
01:00:18,741 --> 01:00:18,961
I mean,

2098
01:00:18,961 --> 01:00:19,281
if you,

2099
01:00:19,281 --> 01:00:22,300
have you read any of the work
that's been done to try to,

2100
01:00:22,340 --> 01:00:22,521
well,

2101
01:00:22,521 --> 01:00:23,030
so this,

2102
01:00:23,030 --> 01:00:23,391
he's,

2103
01:00:23,391 --> 01:00:23,840
he's like,

2104
01:00:23,840 --> 01:00:24,561
he's like the,

2105
01:00:24,561 --> 01:00:25,140
the,

2106
01:00:25,140 --> 01:00:26,930
the sort of boy phenom of,

2107
01:00:26,931 --> 01:00:27,261
of,

2108
01:00:27,261 --> 01:00:28,094
of physics.

2109
01:00:28,340 --> 01:00:30,210
He's backed by the like,

2110
01:00:30,380 --> 01:00:30,870
you know,

2111
01:00:30,870 --> 01:00:31,370
uh,

2112
01:00:31,370 --> 01:00:32,600
Bill Gates and,

2113
01:00:32,601 --> 01:00:33,434
and you know,

2114
01:00:33,440 --> 01:00:34,850
Buffett and uh,

2115
01:00:35,070 --> 01:00:35,840
the Google,

2116
01:00:35,840 --> 01:00:36,920
the Google guys,

2117
01:00:36,921 --> 01:00:37,161
I mean,

2118
01:00:37,161 --> 01:00:38,690
he's sort of like a vetted kid.

2119
01:00:38,691 --> 01:00:39,650
He's a famous,

2120
01:00:40,040 --> 01:00:40,371
you know,

2121
01:00:40,371 --> 01:00:41,900
brain about this stuff.

2122
01:00:41,901 --> 01:00:45,110
I'm pretty sure that they're not going
to just say come spew bullshit to a bunch

2123
01:00:45,111 --> 01:00:45,651
of fucking,

2124
01:00:45,651 --> 01:00:45,891
you know,

2125
01:00:45,891 --> 01:00:46,700
old people.

2126
01:00:46,700 --> 01:00:47,540
But again,

2127
01:00:47,541 --> 01:00:47,781
I,

2128
01:00:47,781 --> 01:00:49,580
I have not verified it,

2129
01:00:49,581 --> 01:00:50,540
but this is his theory.

2130
01:00:50,541 --> 01:00:52,760
Someone should look them up online
or figure it out or whatever.

2131
01:00:52,761 --> 01:00:54,320
But when I heard that,

2132
01:00:54,321 --> 01:00:54,830
I'm like,

2133
01:00:54,830 --> 01:00:55,340
again,

2134
01:00:55,340 --> 01:00:56,480
even if it isn't true,

2135
01:00:56,510 --> 01:00:59,420
that's the type of shit
that we should be going for.

2136
01:00:59,421 --> 01:01:02,540
Because once we realize that
if global warming is true,

2137
01:01:02,541 --> 01:01:03,200
which it is,

2138
01:01:03,200 --> 01:01:06,410
if we have to cut carbon
emissions by 80% which we can,

2139
01:01:06,680 --> 01:01:08,690
then you need to have this
technology which says,

2140
01:01:08,840 --> 01:01:09,350
okay,

2141
01:01:09,350 --> 01:01:10,640
all of the fuel is there.

2142
01:01:10,970 --> 01:01:11,450
We don't have to,

2143
01:01:11,450 --> 01:01:15,320
no one has to pay for energy anymore
cause 20,000 years of fuel is in these

2144
01:01:15,321 --> 01:01:18,050
spent reactors that we
don't have to pay for it.

2145
01:01:18,051 --> 01:01:18,650
So yeah,

2146
01:01:18,650 --> 01:01:21,650
but that Shit's going to get moved to
run on trucks that are going to be driven

2147
01:01:21,651 --> 01:01:24,440
by God's on math and they're
going to fucking go off the road.

2148
01:01:24,500 --> 01:01:26,390
That's what the gas
companies are going to say.

2149
01:01:26,391 --> 01:01:29,730
Cause they're going to want us to take
like 50 to a hundred years to institute

2150
01:01:29,731 --> 01:01:30,090
detection.

2151
01:01:30,090 --> 01:01:30,220
Yeah.

2152
01:01:30,220 --> 01:01:33,170
All the gas companies are going
to hire drivers to be on the Mat,

2153
01:01:33,740 --> 01:01:34,840
make sure they crash.

2154
01:01:34,990 --> 01:01:38,410
They're going to give these dudes
meth so they hold on a second.

2155
01:01:38,560 --> 01:01:39,310
Shit,

2156
01:01:39,310 --> 01:01:40,720
get away from your doom and gloom.

2157
01:01:40,721 --> 01:01:41,650
Shouldn't say yes Joe,

2158
01:01:41,651 --> 01:01:42,041
you're right.

2159
01:01:42,041 --> 01:01:43,360
We can fucking be better.

2160
01:01:43,390 --> 01:01:44,230
We can be better.

2161
01:01:44,231 --> 01:01:45,370
But it's not this way.

2162
01:01:45,580 --> 01:01:48,520
Traveling around with fucking
truck loads of nuclear waste.

2163
01:01:48,550 --> 01:01:49,230
Whoa.

2164
01:01:49,230 --> 01:01:50,540
We'll bring the machine to the wayside.

2165
01:01:51,020 --> 01:01:51,940
It's not happening.

2166
01:01:53,380 --> 01:01:54,370
This is a mess.

2167
01:01:54,580 --> 01:01:55,580
This is a goddamn mess.

2168
01:01:55,581 --> 01:01:57,970
They're going to drive nuclear
waste through the middle of America.

2169
01:01:58,510 --> 01:02:02,230
They're going to have trucks full of
death just rolling through your town 40

2170
01:02:02,231 --> 01:02:03,064
miles an hour.

2171
01:02:03,150 --> 01:02:05,920
The already I already do.

2172
01:02:05,990 --> 01:02:08,020
I mean we've been doing
it for 50 fucking years.

2173
01:02:08,021 --> 01:02:08,261
Red.

2174
01:02:08,261 --> 01:02:12,610
I'd skinny man whose hair is falling
out like fucking fall leaves cause he's

2175
01:02:12,611 --> 01:02:14,260
just radiated the fuck.

2176
01:02:14,320 --> 01:02:14,951
Oh No.

2177
01:02:14,951 --> 01:02:16,720
He's radiating off and on math.

2178
01:02:17,240 --> 01:02:18,360
Matt,

2179
01:02:18,430 --> 01:02:20,730
just fucking gun in it
through the main street.

2180
01:02:21,120 --> 01:02:23,910
Ignoring lights like a Stephen King movie.

2181
01:02:24,410 --> 01:02:24,900
Just see,

2182
01:02:24,900 --> 01:02:25,360
right.

2183
01:02:25,360 --> 01:02:29,790
I want to bring kids into that red eyed
skinny and what the fucking hammered to

2184
01:02:29,791 --> 01:02:30,624
the floor.

2185
01:02:30,790 --> 01:02:32,740
Bye Bye.

2186
01:02:35,740 --> 01:02:37,170
No s'mores in the balance.

2187
01:02:37,520 --> 01:02:39,270
You know someone's writing
this all down right now.

2188
01:02:39,271 --> 01:02:40,650
It's going to be a movie in six months.

2189
01:02:40,710 --> 01:02:41,543
I hope that it is.

2190
01:02:41,580 --> 01:02:42,900
I like moving truck.

2191
01:02:42,901 --> 01:02:46,620
Can't extremely dangerous radioactive
material found after it was stolen in

2192
01:02:46,621 --> 01:02:47,190
Mexico.

2193
01:02:47,190 --> 01:02:47,701
Um,

2194
01:02:47,701 --> 01:02:48,750
hey,

2195
01:02:50,250 --> 01:02:52,470
don't they have like at least one guard?

2196
01:02:52,900 --> 01:02:57,030
You gotta fucking a couple of dudes
with machine guns when you're carrying

2197
01:02:57,031 --> 01:03:01,080
around nuclear waste in the
back of a truck going to Mexico.

2198
01:03:01,540 --> 01:03:02,790
Jesus Christ.

2199
01:03:02,900 --> 01:03:06,650
There was a famous story of
a bunch of guys in Brazil,

2200
01:03:07,400 --> 01:03:07,760
uh,

2201
01:03:07,760 --> 01:03:12,760
broke into a hospital to steal shit and
they stole like a safe for scrap metal.

2202
01:03:14,090 --> 01:03:17,300
And the safe was a where
they kept the cesium,

2203
01:03:17,301 --> 01:03:17,751
which is,

2204
01:03:17,751 --> 01:03:18,080
you know,

2205
01:03:18,080 --> 01:03:18,850
the,

2206
01:03:18,850 --> 01:03:19,210
it's,

2207
01:03:19,210 --> 01:03:22,430
it's radioactive material that they
use for treating tumors and stuff.

2208
01:03:22,760 --> 01:03:26,200
And they had a high speed
chase through the town and uh,

2209
01:03:26,250 --> 01:03:27,650
they had sort of cracked open the safe.

2210
01:03:27,651 --> 01:03:31,250
There was all the cesium was sorta this
white powder was sort of falling out

2211
01:03:31,251 --> 01:03:32,860
around the town as the,

2212
01:03:32,960 --> 01:03:37,960
the cops were chasing them and they had
to take the whole town brick by brick

2213
01:03:38,510 --> 01:03:43,510
and bury it under fucking concrete and
led because it radiated the whole fucking

2214
01:03:44,451 --> 01:03:44,661
thing.

2215
01:03:44,661 --> 01:03:45,530
And this is just

2216
01:03:45,620 --> 01:03:46,550
from a hospital.

2217
01:03:47,680 --> 01:03:50,660
They had to take the whole
town apart and bury it under,

2218
01:03:50,661 --> 01:03:51,000
under,

2219
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:51,920
like led and,

2220
01:03:51,921 --> 01:03:53,000
and concrete.

2221
01:03:54,430 --> 01:03:54,980
So look,

2222
01:03:54,980 --> 01:03:55,231
my,

2223
01:03:55,231 --> 01:03:56,150
my whole thing is

2224
01:03:56,570 --> 01:03:57,403
terrified.

2225
01:03:57,410 --> 01:03:58,820
I'm terrified of that shit,

2226
01:03:59,150 --> 01:03:59,781
but I'm like,

2227
01:03:59,781 --> 01:04:01,970
and I don't believe we know what
we're doing with the technology.

2228
01:04:01,971 --> 01:04:02,804
I'm terrified.

2229
01:04:03,050 --> 01:04:04,520
I'm terrified to proliferation.

2230
01:04:04,880 --> 01:04:05,361
However,

2231
01:04:05,361 --> 01:04:10,130
if you can take all those spent
fucking fuel rods and power the world,

2232
01:04:10,190 --> 01:04:12,230
then at least shouldn't we
give that a fucking shot?

2233
01:04:12,440 --> 01:04:12,771
Yes.

2234
01:04:12,771 --> 01:04:13,940
If we can really do that.

2235
01:04:14,220 --> 01:04:14,500
Uh,

2236
01:04:14,500 --> 01:04:18,410
I'm just joking around
obviously about the gas,

2237
01:04:18,411 --> 01:04:20,600
Maddie's fuel and people up in math,

2238
01:04:20,660 --> 01:04:22,610
but if they can,

2239
01:04:22,640 --> 01:04:22,941
you know,

2240
01:04:22,941 --> 01:04:23,270
I mean,

2241
01:04:23,270 --> 01:04:26,430
I guarantee you it's going to be just
like trying to get medical marijuana

2242
01:04:26,431 --> 01:04:27,020
illegal.

2243
01:04:27,020 --> 01:04:29,750
The pharmaceutical companies are going
to lobby against it because they know

2244
01:04:29,751 --> 01:04:30,710
that you're going to lose money.

2245
01:04:30,711 --> 01:04:33,440
So the gas company's going to lobby
against us because they know it's going to

2246
01:04:33,441 --> 01:04:34,240
cost them money.

2247
01:04:34,240 --> 01:04:34,490
Correct.

2248
01:04:34,490 --> 01:04:34,940
And dealt,

2249
01:04:34,940 --> 01:04:38,300
still play dirty because you're dealing
with billions of while President Rogan

2250
01:04:38,301 --> 01:04:38,771
is there.

2251
01:04:38,771 --> 01:04:40,070
He's resonant.

2252
01:04:40,090 --> 01:04:40,440
Rolling.

2253
01:04:40,440 --> 01:04:40,940
Please.

2254
01:04:40,940 --> 01:04:42,660
People will have to be immortal around,

2255
01:04:42,690 --> 01:04:45,140
I'm going to have to do
it remotely from Mars.

2256
01:04:45,160 --> 01:04:45,430
That's,

2257
01:04:45,430 --> 01:04:48,230
that's when President Roh Rogan
runs everything from the Internet,

2258
01:04:48,231 --> 01:04:49,010
from Mars.

2259
01:04:49,010 --> 01:04:51,170
It's fucking earth would
be a wasteland by then.

2260
01:04:51,950 --> 01:04:53,180
Everyone will be gone.

2261
01:04:53,210 --> 01:04:55,010
Mars would be like the
gated community of space.

2262
01:04:58,960 --> 01:04:59,181
Yeah,

2263
01:04:59,181 --> 01:05:02,930
I'll fucking terraform with fake
fake plants growing everywhere.

2264
01:05:02,931 --> 01:05:05,900
Everyone eating fake Chinese eggs and
that'll be the day when people say the

2265
01:05:05,901 --> 01:05:07,310
hills and they're talking about Mars.

2266
01:05:07,640 --> 01:05:08,090
That's it.

2267
01:05:08,090 --> 01:05:08,901
Is it the hills though?

2268
01:05:08,901 --> 01:05:09,711
Subject to anymore.

2269
01:05:09,711 --> 01:05:10,640
Who's talking about the hills?

2270
01:05:10,750 --> 01:05:12,050
So I was talking to me about the hills.

2271
01:05:12,051 --> 01:05:14,030
I fucking plug my ears and I walk away.

2272
01:05:14,060 --> 01:05:14,221
Well,

2273
01:05:14,221 --> 01:05:16,220
I've been in La for three
weeks now and people are,

2274
01:05:16,280 --> 01:05:17,320
there's a party in the hills.

2275
01:05:17,321 --> 01:05:17,820
We're going to the,

2276
01:05:17,820 --> 01:05:18,380
Oh,

2277
01:05:18,380 --> 01:05:19,001
I see.

2278
01:05:19,001 --> 01:05:20,650
I thought you meant the show.

2279
01:05:20,870 --> 01:05:22,000
No show called the hills,

2280
01:05:22,001 --> 01:05:22,810
right?

2281
01:05:22,810 --> 01:05:26,320
Wasn't that the one with the fucking
the girl got all the plastic surgery.

2282
01:05:26,430 --> 01:05:26,970
Yeah.

2283
01:05:26,970 --> 01:05:27,510
Yeah.

2284
01:05:27,510 --> 01:05:28,343
Thank you.

2285
01:05:28,570 --> 01:05:29,890
You meet the Hollywood hills.

2286
01:05:29,980 --> 01:05:30,500
Yeah,

2287
01:05:30,500 --> 01:05:30,870
dude,

2288
01:05:30,870 --> 01:05:32,530
the Hollywood hills a terrible,

2289
01:05:32,560 --> 01:05:35,800
but what they're amazing for
is that fucking view at night.

2290
01:05:36,040 --> 01:05:37,600
It's not like anywhere else in the world.

2291
01:05:37,601 --> 01:05:41,170
If you get high above doe Heeney I
had a buddy used to have a house on

2292
01:05:41,230 --> 01:05:42,063
[inaudible].

2293
01:05:42,130 --> 01:05:43,420
It's incredible.

2294
01:05:43,570 --> 01:05:46,960
That view is like blade runner
because you see the grid,

2295
01:05:46,990 --> 01:05:48,730
the the light grid at night.

2296
01:05:48,910 --> 01:05:50,470
It looks like shit during the day.

2297
01:05:50,471 --> 01:05:55,120
It looks like dog shit cause you just
see gray buildings and and fucking smog.

2298
01:05:55,270 --> 01:05:58,390
But at nighttime it looks
like a science fiction movie.

2299
01:05:58,500 --> 01:06:00,400
It's incredibly beautiful,

2300
01:06:00,550 --> 01:06:03,460
like way more beautiful than the
neon lights of Vegas cause it's,

2301
01:06:03,670 --> 01:06:05,350
it's oddly symmetrical.

2302
01:06:05,470 --> 01:06:08,260
It's really fascinating
because they're right above it.

2303
01:06:08,260 --> 01:06:11,680
It's like the perfect height above
it for this amazing light show I got.

2304
01:06:11,690 --> 01:06:12,523
I got to see that.

2305
01:06:12,610 --> 01:06:13,000
Yeah,

2306
01:06:13,000 --> 01:06:13,510
it's dope.

2307
01:06:13,510 --> 01:06:14,500
It's a great place to live.

2308
01:06:14,501 --> 01:06:16,060
But as far as like,

2309
01:06:16,410 --> 01:06:16,721
you know,

2310
01:06:16,721 --> 01:06:19,780
places that you would
want to actually live.

2311
01:06:19,781 --> 01:06:21,130
Other than that for that view,

2312
01:06:21,160 --> 01:06:22,270
it's fucking Hollywood hills.

2313
01:06:22,310 --> 01:06:23,200
Fairly douchey.

2314
01:06:23,350 --> 01:06:24,161
It's not just douchey.

2315
01:06:24,161 --> 01:06:24,971
It's dangerous.

2316
01:06:24,971 --> 01:06:27,970
I know two people that had been
home invaded up there fuck off.

2317
01:06:28,030 --> 01:06:28,781
Oh yeah man.

2318
01:06:28,781 --> 01:06:31,510
There's a whole scam with
people watching your house.

2319
01:06:31,511 --> 01:06:31,811
You don't,

2320
01:06:31,811 --> 01:06:32,060
you know,

2321
01:06:32,060 --> 01:06:34,090
people park cars and cases.

2322
01:06:34,540 --> 01:06:35,020
Sure.

2323
01:06:35,020 --> 01:06:37,180
Well there was a guy that
was selling a house up there.

2324
01:06:37,181 --> 01:06:38,970
It's a fascinating story and a,

2325
01:06:38,980 --> 01:06:41,860
for a very brief time I
thought about living up there.

2326
01:06:42,130 --> 01:06:42,371
I was like,

2327
01:06:42,371 --> 01:06:42,521
man,

2328
01:06:42,521 --> 01:06:42,990
it'd be nice.

2329
01:06:42,990 --> 01:06:44,260
I was closer to the comedy store.

2330
01:06:44,261 --> 01:06:46,090
I could just get down to the
comedy store in 10 minutes.

2331
01:06:46,090 --> 01:06:46,231
I mean,

2332
01:06:46,231 --> 01:06:47,320
that would be kind of Nice.

2333
01:06:47,860 --> 01:06:48,610
Um,

2334
01:06:48,610 --> 01:06:49,350
so I,

2335
01:06:49,350 --> 01:06:50,740
it's just a fucking,

2336
01:06:50,830 --> 01:06:52,570
just not a committed thought at all.

2337
01:06:52,571 --> 01:06:53,404
Just a,

2338
01:06:53,650 --> 01:06:54,483
that's the view.

2339
01:06:54,550 --> 01:06:55,840
That's how spectacular that looks.

2340
01:06:55,841 --> 01:06:56,674
Look at that shit up there.

2341
01:06:57,100 --> 01:06:58,990
That's really what it looks
like from my boy's house.

2342
01:06:58,991 --> 01:07:00,060
It was in cuffs were ratable.

2343
01:07:00,610 --> 01:07:01,720
His was even better than that.

2344
01:07:01,721 --> 01:07:02,830
His was a little lower.

2345
01:07:02,860 --> 01:07:04,870
He's like on the edge
of what we're looking,

2346
01:07:04,871 --> 01:07:07,990
you're looking down at some houses
and then that he was at the edge.

2347
01:07:07,991 --> 01:07:11,860
So all he saw was the grid
and it was just magnificent.

2348
01:07:12,280 --> 01:07:12,641
So anyway,

2349
01:07:12,641 --> 01:07:15,100
this guy had this pretty nice house up
there and he had a really pretty view

2350
01:07:15,101 --> 01:07:15,850
like that.

2351
01:07:15,850 --> 01:07:16,181
And,

2352
01:07:16,181 --> 01:07:16,231
uh,

2353
01:07:16,231 --> 01:07:17,080
I was thinking about it,

2354
01:07:17,081 --> 01:07:17,411
but I was like,

2355
01:07:17,411 --> 01:07:17,621
man,

2356
01:07:17,621 --> 01:07:18,454
I just don't like,

2357
01:07:18,510 --> 01:07:20,080
this house is so showy.

2358
01:07:20,380 --> 01:07:21,790
And it's like right on the street.

2359
01:07:22,060 --> 01:07:23,050
Like anyone could just wa,

2360
01:07:23,070 --> 01:07:27,970
I mean it's literally you could throw
a person from the sidewalk and slam

2361
01:07:27,971 --> 01:07:30,760
through the window where you could pick
someone up and use them as a rock to

2362
01:07:30,761 --> 01:07:31,750
hurl through this guy's window.

2363
01:07:32,020 --> 01:07:32,291
I was like,

2364
01:07:32,291 --> 01:07:33,520
that just doesn't make any sense to me.

2365
01:07:33,820 --> 01:07:34,251
And he'd go,

2366
01:07:34,251 --> 01:07:34,451
well,

2367
01:07:34,451 --> 01:07:36,580
it's got to be a state of
the art security system.

2368
01:07:36,820 --> 01:07:37,450
I go,

2369
01:07:37,450 --> 01:07:37,781
I go,

2370
01:07:37,781 --> 01:07:38,070
what?

2371
01:07:38,070 --> 01:07:39,730
These cameras and you know what that is?

2372
01:07:39,850 --> 01:07:40,061
I go,

2373
01:07:40,061 --> 01:07:42,790
you're going to get a video of a
dude with a ski mask robbing you.

2374
01:07:44,180 --> 01:07:45,130
This is what I said to him.

2375
01:07:45,430 --> 01:07:47,590
Two weeks later he was dead.

2376
01:07:48,180 --> 01:07:49,750
He shot in the neck,

2377
01:07:49,780 --> 01:07:51,940
in a home invasion in that very house.

2378
01:07:52,890 --> 01:07:53,101
Yeah.

2379
01:07:53,101 --> 01:07:53,980
He used to like hookers.

2380
01:07:53,981 --> 01:07:57,820
This guy who's crate and we
used to call him wild man.

2381
01:07:58,060 --> 01:08:00,640
I had a buddy who worked
at a strip club and uh,

2382
01:08:00,641 --> 01:08:04,180
this dude used to come in and he
apparently invented like bell bottoms or

2383
01:08:04,181 --> 01:08:05,350
something nutty like that.

2384
01:08:05,440 --> 01:08:08,350
Like he invented something
and made a fuck load of money.

2385
01:08:08,510 --> 01:08:10,780
And it was owl calls if
you live in a glass house.

2386
01:08:10,810 --> 01:08:11,201
Yeah.

2387
01:08:11,201 --> 01:08:14,260
And he was getting a
emphysema because of his,

2388
01:08:14,261 --> 01:08:15,094
um,

2389
01:08:15,260 --> 01:08:16,093
what are you doing dude?

2390
01:08:16,310 --> 01:08:17,900
That's just showing stuff
like you're talking about.

2391
01:08:18,020 --> 01:08:18,261
Oh,

2392
01:08:18,261 --> 01:08:18,680
okay.

2393
01:08:18,680 --> 01:08:19,513
That does the same thing.

2394
01:08:19,670 --> 01:08:20,060
Um,

2395
01:08:20,060 --> 01:08:21,140
he was um,

2396
01:08:22,220 --> 01:08:25,640
he was getting emphysema from
cigarettes and so he decided to quit the

2397
01:08:25,641 --> 01:08:27,200
cigarettes and his doctor told them,

2398
01:08:27,201 --> 01:08:27,381
look,

2399
01:08:27,381 --> 01:08:29,000
if you have to smoke smoke marijuana,

2400
01:08:29,001 --> 01:08:29,960
at least it's not going to kill you.

2401
01:08:30,170 --> 01:08:33,740
So this dude's are smoking marijuana
and decides he doesn't want to work

2402
01:08:33,741 --> 01:08:34,574
anymore,

2403
01:08:34,580 --> 01:08:37,370
decides all he wants to do from now on.

2404
01:08:37,520 --> 01:08:41,180
He wants to play his guitar and
then he wants to get prostitutes.

2405
01:08:42,200 --> 01:08:45,500
So he's got a lot of money and
he thinks he's almost dead right?

2406
01:08:45,501 --> 01:08:46,550
Cause he had emphysema.

2407
01:08:46,610 --> 01:08:50,210
So he goes to the strip clubs and starts
paying girls to have sex with them,

2408
01:08:50,360 --> 01:08:51,650
like incredible money,

2409
01:08:51,651 --> 01:08:52,760
like $3,000,

2410
01:08:52,761 --> 01:08:53,571
$4,000,

2411
01:08:53,571 --> 01:08:54,381
$5,000.

2412
01:08:54,381 --> 01:08:55,214
What am I going to pay you?

2413
01:08:55,310 --> 01:08:55,791
It's crazy.

2414
01:08:55,791 --> 01:08:57,020
Gravelly cigarette voice.

2415
01:08:57,320 --> 01:09:01,670
And apparently he was really rude to
these girls and one of them came over to

2416
01:09:01,671 --> 01:09:04,210
his house and brought a guy and they,

2417
01:09:04,430 --> 01:09:07,640
the guy came in and robbed
him and shot him in the neck.

2418
01:09:08,390 --> 01:09:10,730
And this was the very house
that I was telling him,

2419
01:09:11,030 --> 01:09:14,000
you're going to get robbed by a dude with
a ski mask and they got to get a nice

2420
01:09:14,001 --> 01:09:16,150
video of that and no one's
ever going to catch that.

2421
01:09:16,160 --> 01:09:16,500
Right.

2422
01:09:16,500 --> 01:09:19,220
The heaviest a podcast ever.

2423
01:09:19,670 --> 01:09:20,361
Well it was,

2424
01:09:20,361 --> 01:09:21,650
he was a weird guy man.

2425
01:09:21,651 --> 01:09:22,880
This this guy wild man.

2426
01:09:22,881 --> 01:09:26,240
Cause it was when you hear like the mean
shit that he would say to the girls or

2427
01:09:26,241 --> 01:09:27,260
even about the girls,

2428
01:09:27,590 --> 01:09:27,920
what,

2429
01:09:27,920 --> 01:09:31,140
it didn't make you sympathetic to him
but you know on another hand like I

2430
01:09:31,141 --> 01:09:32,990
shouldn't get shot in
the neck and his house.

2431
01:09:33,440 --> 01:09:34,250
I Dunno.

2432
01:09:34,250 --> 01:09:36,320
I Dunno what the circumstances were.

2433
01:09:36,321 --> 01:09:37,400
I don't know if you had a comment,

2434
01:09:37,401 --> 01:09:41,600
I don't know what the fuck happened but
I do know that the Hollywood hills gets

2435
01:09:41,601 --> 01:09:42,710
broken into a lot.

2436
01:09:43,010 --> 01:09:46,130
I had another friend who lived up there
who caught a guy trying to break into

2437
01:09:46,131 --> 01:09:47,240
his house in the middle of the night.

2438
01:09:48,830 --> 01:09:49,191
There's,

2439
01:09:49,191 --> 01:09:50,024
um,

2440
01:09:50,180 --> 01:09:51,013
there's a lot of that,

2441
01:09:51,020 --> 01:09:51,711
a lot of that up there.

2442
01:09:51,711 --> 01:09:52,670
It's a tricky spot.

2443
01:09:52,760 --> 01:09:54,050
It's a tricky spot because it's,

2444
01:09:54,051 --> 01:09:54,380
uh,

2445
01:09:54,380 --> 01:09:56,750
it's so affluent and so accessible.

2446
01:09:57,080 --> 01:09:57,351
You know,

2447
01:09:57,351 --> 01:09:57,711
you're,

2448
01:09:57,711 --> 01:09:58,910
you drive three minutes,

2449
01:09:58,911 --> 01:09:59,721
you're on sunset,

2450
01:09:59,721 --> 01:10:00,231
you go left,

2451
01:10:00,231 --> 01:10:00,741
you go right,

2452
01:10:00,741 --> 01:10:01,221
you go down,

2453
01:10:01,221 --> 01:10:01,641
you go up,

2454
01:10:01,641 --> 01:10:02,450
you're gone.

2455
01:10:02,450 --> 01:10:02,751
You know,

2456
01:10:02,751 --> 01:10:06,320
so someone could like sneak in from
a bad neighborhood slip up there.

2457
01:10:06,590 --> 01:10:10,490
It's not like Beverly hills where they
have like constant drives where the cops

2458
01:10:10,491 --> 01:10:12,350
are called constantly
cruising the neighborhood,

2459
01:10:12,530 --> 01:10:14,900
making sure there's no
suspicious people and all that.

2460
01:10:15,230 --> 01:10:15,891
The Hollywood hills,

2461
01:10:15,891 --> 01:10:19,160
everybody's driving up there
and wandering around so it gets,

2462
01:10:19,161 --> 01:10:19,401
uh,

2463
01:10:19,401 --> 01:10:20,240
it gets sketch.

2464
01:10:20,600 --> 01:10:22,490
Ice Tea got held up up there.

2465
01:10:22,491 --> 01:10:24,410
Ice Tea used to have a house
in the Hollywood hills.

2466
01:10:24,590 --> 01:10:25,520
He got home invaded.

2467
01:10:25,970 --> 01:10:27,530
He got held up at gun.

2468
01:10:28,280 --> 01:10:29,330
It's pretty common.

2469
01:10:29,540 --> 01:10:30,590
I didn't know it was like that.

2470
01:10:30,650 --> 01:10:30,981
Yeah.

2471
01:10:30,981 --> 01:10:33,350
Well it's a lot of money
whenever you have a lot of money.

2472
01:10:33,351 --> 01:10:33,531
I mean,

2473
01:10:33,531 --> 01:10:34,790
you see some of those houses up there,

2474
01:10:34,791 --> 01:10:35,690
they're fucking beautiful,

2475
01:10:35,691 --> 01:10:36,530
beautiful houses.

2476
01:10:36,740 --> 01:10:37,520
And you know,

2477
01:10:37,520 --> 01:10:38,450
you look at a house like that,

2478
01:10:38,451 --> 01:10:38,631
okay,

2479
01:10:38,631 --> 01:10:39,920
that house is worth $7 million.

2480
01:10:39,980 --> 01:10:42,380
So this motherfucker in
his house got $7 million.

2481
01:10:42,670 --> 01:10:44,090
Well he's get some
other shit in there too.

2482
01:10:44,660 --> 01:10:47,450
So you wait until someone's closing
their garage and then you run out of the

2483
01:10:47,451 --> 01:10:48,350
bushes and boom,

2484
01:10:48,351 --> 01:10:49,940
you're in the garage and
you can't get up there.

2485
01:10:49,941 --> 01:10:50,451
FASC it.

2486
01:10:50,451 --> 01:10:51,640
Cops can't get up there found.

2487
01:10:51,710 --> 01:10:52,521
You can't see it.

2488
01:10:52,521 --> 01:10:53,150
You're covered.

2489
01:10:53,150 --> 01:10:54,260
How are you going to call the cops too?

2490
01:10:54,261 --> 01:10:55,270
You don't get cell phone signal.

2491
01:10:55,290 --> 01:10:56,123
Your fucking house.

2492
01:10:56,300 --> 01:10:59,610
Eddie is a staying at the motel eights.

2493
01:11:00,410 --> 01:11:03,080
[inaudible] it's all done.

2494
01:11:03,560 --> 01:11:05,280
I'm just hanging out with
the people that robbed them.

2495
01:11:05,580 --> 01:11:06,360
We'll add that.

2496
01:11:06,360 --> 01:11:06,710
You know,

2497
01:11:06,710 --> 01:11:08,510
as the economy gets,

2498
01:11:08,800 --> 01:11:12,020
there's a further and further gap
between people with money because without

2499
01:11:12,021 --> 01:11:13,200
money it becomes more,

2500
01:11:13,230 --> 01:11:14,370
it becomes more and more dangerous

2501
01:11:14,370 --> 01:11:15,390
to flaunt it like that,

2502
01:11:15,391 --> 01:11:16,830
especially in the middle of a city.

2503
01:11:17,170 --> 01:11:17,430
True.

2504
01:11:17,430 --> 01:11:17,610
Like,

2505
01:11:17,610 --> 01:11:20,640
that's why I always freaked
out about Hancock Park.

2506
01:11:21,120 --> 01:11:21,361
You know,

2507
01:11:21,361 --> 01:11:24,540
Hancock Park has these
insanely beautiful homes,

2508
01:11:25,030 --> 01:11:27,570
the insanely beautiful like old world,

2509
01:11:27,571 --> 01:11:28,950
old Hollywood houses,

2510
01:11:28,951 --> 01:11:30,270
these giant mansions.

2511
01:11:30,271 --> 01:11:34,020
Like a friend of mine went over this guy's
house and she said that he has like a

2512
01:11:34,021 --> 01:11:34,920
theater in his house,

2513
01:11:34,921 --> 01:11:39,540
like a full theater with velvet
curtains and incredible gold guild work.

2514
01:11:39,541 --> 01:11:44,040
And the house was built in the 20s like
some fucking Cary grant guy built it and

2515
01:11:44,041 --> 01:11:44,281
he said,

2516
01:11:44,281 --> 01:11:48,090
it's amazing and it's fucking
five blocks from east La,

2517
01:11:48,130 --> 01:11:48,420
right?

2518
01:11:48,420 --> 01:11:51,420
Five blocks from a store where
all the signs are in Spanish,

2519
01:11:51,780 --> 01:11:52,141
you know,

2520
01:11:52,141 --> 01:11:52,620
and you're,

2521
01:11:52,620 --> 01:11:53,400
you know,

2522
01:11:53,400 --> 01:11:58,400
you're living in this crazy stupid
mansion that's so close to like abject

2523
01:11:59,281 --> 01:12:00,000
poverty.

2524
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:01,740
Well I was starting on people.

2525
01:12:01,890 --> 01:12:03,600
That's exactly what you get is dangerous.

2526
01:12:03,630 --> 01:12:05,280
But speaking about Florida,

2527
01:12:05,550 --> 01:12:06,360
yeah,

2528
01:12:06,360 --> 01:12:07,330
I always think that,

2529
01:12:08,140 --> 01:12:10,180
I think that when I go to Miami,

2530
01:12:10,240 --> 01:12:10,571
right,

2531
01:12:10,571 --> 01:12:12,940
because you go on one side of the,

2532
01:12:13,740 --> 01:12:16,170
and it's like baby blue Bentleys and,

2533
01:12:16,470 --> 01:12:18,460
and like these crazy like Pan House,

2534
01:12:18,461 --> 01:12:19,870
like $20 million places.

2535
01:12:20,140 --> 01:12:21,580
And literally on the other side,

2536
01:12:21,581 --> 01:12:23,270
it's like El Salvadorian,

2537
01:12:23,530 --> 01:12:24,970
Guatemala and sorta like,

2538
01:12:24,971 --> 01:12:25,241
you know,

2539
01:12:25,241 --> 01:12:26,570
99 cent but booze,

2540
01:12:26,571 --> 01:12:27,191
those kind of thing.

2541
01:12:27,191 --> 01:12:28,024
And you're like,

2542
01:12:28,330 --> 01:12:32,530
why don't these dudes from this side of
the street who by the way of growing up

2543
01:12:32,531 --> 01:12:36,310
in El Salvador and they're not
sorta any stranger to hard times,

2544
01:12:36,850 --> 01:12:38,500
walk across and just take it,

2545
01:12:38,680 --> 01:12:39,640
you guys fucking car.

2546
01:12:39,850 --> 01:12:40,780
Why wouldn't you do that?

2547
01:12:41,200 --> 01:12:41,441
Well,

2548
01:12:41,441 --> 01:12:43,030
because they're honorable
people and they're happy.

2549
01:12:43,031 --> 01:12:43,930
They're not in El Salvador.

2550
01:12:43,931 --> 01:12:45,230
They don't want to get
arrested in Americans.

2551
01:12:45,231 --> 01:12:46,090
So they get kicked out.

2552
01:12:46,150 --> 01:12:48,250
I would do it if I was broke and starving,

2553
01:12:48,251 --> 01:12:51,100
I would go across and click here
to make their own dreams come true.

2554
01:12:51,101 --> 01:12:52,450
Not to steal the dreams of another man.

2555
01:12:52,451 --> 01:12:54,010
If I was poor and starving,

2556
01:12:54,040 --> 01:12:57,040
I w and some guy's driving
a car worth 250 grand,

2557
01:12:57,070 --> 01:12:58,390
I would take it right there.

2558
01:12:58,391 --> 01:13:01,060
Are they pouring starving
or are they just poor?

2559
01:13:02,080 --> 01:13:02,640
I would be.

2560
01:13:02,640 --> 01:13:02,921
I want to.

2561
01:13:02,921 --> 01:13:03,940
I wouldn't be starving.

2562
01:13:03,941 --> 01:13:04,061
Yeah,

2563
01:13:04,061 --> 01:13:05,290
you have to be starving a lot.

2564
01:13:05,291 --> 01:13:06,550
Most people are just poor,

2565
01:13:07,250 --> 01:13:08,950
poor and starving number's pretty small.

2566
01:13:08,951 --> 01:13:10,240
I think I wouldn't take it,

2567
01:13:10,241 --> 01:13:11,920
but I would definitely
take a shit on your hood.

2568
01:13:12,630 --> 01:13:14,710
I just want to fuck your shit up,

2569
01:13:14,711 --> 01:13:15,590
but I don't want to steal.

2570
01:13:15,610 --> 01:13:16,750
Why be a hater like that?

2571
01:13:16,900 --> 01:13:20,980
Why shouldn't I Mansa the guy works so
hard to get a nice car and he decided to

2572
01:13:20,981 --> 01:13:21,910
keep it in the neighborhood.

2573
01:13:22,060 --> 01:13:25,630
And what do you do your shit on a set
like a big Ar brings me no enjoyment,

2574
01:13:25,631 --> 01:13:27,430
but my shit on that hood is brings.

2575
01:13:27,460 --> 01:13:30,130
Oh well that's cause you
got to hate her mentality.

2576
01:13:30,490 --> 01:13:33,220
He shouldn't give you enjoyment
because she should give you hope.

2577
01:13:33,520 --> 01:13:34,600
You should look at that and say,

2578
01:13:34,601 --> 01:13:34,871
look,

2579
01:13:34,871 --> 01:13:36,250
this asshole can make that money.

2580
01:13:36,251 --> 01:13:36,550
What's,

2581
01:13:36,550 --> 01:13:37,450
why is he better than me?

2582
01:13:37,451 --> 01:13:38,200
He's not.

2583
01:13:38,200 --> 01:13:39,430
So this is inspiration.

2584
01:13:39,520 --> 01:13:40,540
You use it for fuel.

2585
01:13:40,630 --> 01:13:41,560
Go on and get your own car.

2586
01:13:42,100 --> 01:13:43,960
Shit on his car.

2587
01:13:44,480 --> 01:13:45,460
All you're going to think about is,

2588
01:13:45,461 --> 01:13:45,671
man,

2589
01:13:45,671 --> 01:13:47,730
I hope I don't have a car like
this says some asshole like me.

2590
01:13:47,731 --> 01:13:48,890
He's going to come along and shit on it.

2591
01:13:49,030 --> 01:13:49,570
It would be like,

2592
01:13:49,570 --> 01:13:50,560
I can't wait til the day.

2593
01:13:50,561 --> 01:13:53,430
There's some asshole like me that
shits on my car when I had that.

2594
01:13:53,431 --> 01:13:54,670
Cause when you have that car you're like,

2595
01:13:54,671 --> 01:13:55,630
I'm glad you mad.

2596
01:13:56,020 --> 01:13:56,840
I'm so glad.

2597
01:13:56,840 --> 01:14:00,100
You're glad enough that
someone steps on your hood,

2598
01:14:00,130 --> 01:14:02,290
dense your fucking hood
and it shits on it.

2599
01:14:02,680 --> 01:14:03,610
That is just rude,

2600
01:14:03,611 --> 01:14:06,280
disrespectful property and
you can't sell that anytime.

2601
01:14:06,281 --> 01:14:10,420
I can call that in America
when I buy a car nut,

2602
01:14:10,421 --> 01:14:13,240
I'm just going to that someone
one day will shit on this hood.

2603
01:14:13,300 --> 01:14:13,751
They like they,

2604
01:14:13,751 --> 01:14:14,890
I listen to Joe Rogan,

2605
01:14:14,891 --> 01:14:16,870
I'm going to go find
his car shit on his own.

2606
01:14:16,960 --> 01:14:18,190
That is so rude.

2607
01:14:18,400 --> 01:14:21,700
I can't believe you put that out there
because it's going to come back and it's

2608
01:14:21,701 --> 01:14:23,860
going to land right in
your fucking dashboard.

2609
01:14:24,210 --> 01:14:27,430
So I'm just going to take
video now about shit.

2610
01:14:27,670 --> 01:14:30,240
They got to punch a hole
straight through your dashboard.

2611
01:14:30,250 --> 01:14:33,370
Just threads to your windshield so they
can shit directly under your dashboard.

2612
01:14:34,330 --> 01:14:35,050
How dare you?

2613
01:14:35,050 --> 01:14:38,170
How dare you even think like
that upper deck or sunroof shit.

2614
01:14:38,680 --> 01:14:40,010
Even the more pro move.

2615
01:14:40,450 --> 01:14:40,781
Well,

2616
01:14:40,781 --> 01:14:41,171
it really,

2617
01:14:41,171 --> 01:14:42,340
if you want to shit in your own hand,

2618
01:14:42,341 --> 01:14:45,520
then smear it in that upper part
where you can never clean it out.

2619
01:14:46,450 --> 01:14:47,440
That's what I'm saying.

2620
01:14:47,770 --> 01:14:49,360
If you want to really fuck up a guy's car,

2621
01:14:49,480 --> 01:14:51,250
but why would you do then man,

2622
01:14:53,500 --> 01:14:54,370
that's bad energy.

2623
01:14:54,371 --> 01:14:54,691
You do.

2624
01:14:54,691 --> 01:14:55,391
You're doing well.

2625
01:14:55,391 --> 01:14:56,470
You don't need to do this.

2626
01:14:56,620 --> 01:14:57,730
You're a successful man.

2627
01:14:58,160 --> 01:14:59,960
Can't be hating on some dude with a badly,

2628
01:14:59,990 --> 01:15:01,060
it's just ridiculous.

2629
01:15:01,330 --> 01:15:02,200
It's a shitty car.

2630
01:15:02,201 --> 01:15:03,460
It's going to break down in them anyway.

2631
01:15:03,820 --> 01:15:05,350
It's going to leave on
the side of the highway.

2632
01:15:06,130 --> 01:15:07,720
I've got a friend who has a Rolls Royce.

2633
01:15:08,020 --> 01:15:08,853
It breaks,

2634
01:15:09,760 --> 01:15:10,593
breaks,

2635
01:15:11,110 --> 01:15:12,040
breaks all the time.

2636
01:15:12,190 --> 01:15:13,090
Things go wrong.

2637
01:15:13,300 --> 01:15:16,570
Ac gets stuck on this
fucking thing goes wrong.

2638
01:15:16,720 --> 01:15:17,980
Radio doesn't work.

2639
01:15:18,100 --> 01:15:19,500
This speakers out there,

2640
01:15:19,540 --> 01:15:22,450
it's a fucking Rolls Royce
and it doesn't make sense.

2641
01:15:23,620 --> 01:15:24,453
Great.

2642
01:15:24,460 --> 01:15:25,181
You can buy like,

2643
01:15:25,181 --> 01:15:25,961
you know on Lincoln,

2644
01:15:25,961 --> 01:15:27,660
you can buy these sort of old like,

2645
01:15:27,810 --> 01:15:28,090
you know,

2646
01:15:28,090 --> 01:15:32,830
Shit Brown seventies rollers for like
five grand and every time I go to Vegas

2647
01:15:32,831 --> 01:15:33,664
I'm like,

2648
01:15:33,880 --> 01:15:38,050
I ain't got to come back with a brick
or two and just buy a shit brown roller

2649
01:15:38,051 --> 01:15:42,040
and get like a punk kid with a safety
pin through his neck or know ms 13 kid to

2650
01:15:42,041 --> 01:15:43,450
just drive me around town,

2651
01:15:44,140 --> 01:15:44,973
sorta roll,

2652
01:15:45,120 --> 01:15:48,850
roll up to the bars and my Shit
Brown 77 Rolls Royce and be like,

2653
01:15:49,620 --> 01:15:52,720
I am I late for the party and you know,

2654
01:15:52,721 --> 01:15:53,770
and just have this kid,

2655
01:15:53,890 --> 01:15:54,610
you know,

2656
01:15:54,610 --> 01:15:56,050
facial tattoos be my driver.

2657
01:15:56,200 --> 01:16:00,250
That's not a bad move is make people
uncomfortable shit on that hood.

2658
01:16:00,251 --> 01:16:01,270
If that kid was driving,

2659
01:16:01,570 --> 01:16:02,620
you would let that slide,

2660
01:16:03,910 --> 01:16:06,500
but you wouldn't shit on the
hood of a 77 year old car,

2661
01:16:06,600 --> 01:16:08,200
1977 car anyway,

2662
01:16:08,220 --> 01:16:08,590
no,

2663
01:16:08,590 --> 01:16:09,101
that car,

2664
01:16:09,101 --> 01:16:10,210
I would respect that whip.

2665
01:16:10,630 --> 01:16:11,351
I know a dude,

2666
01:16:11,351 --> 01:16:11,500
uh,

2667
01:16:11,500 --> 01:16:12,790
cliffy beef from epic games.

2668
01:16:12,791 --> 01:16:15,820
He was telling us that he
had a Lamborghini Aventador.

2669
01:16:16,060 --> 01:16:21,060
It's like 400 plus thousand dollars and
then it broke and door handle broke.

2670
01:16:21,730 --> 01:16:26,170
Had a climbing from his girlfriend's
side or she had a climb over and open up

2671
01:16:26,171 --> 01:16:27,004
his door.

2672
01:16:27,430 --> 01:16:28,540
Just stop.

2673
01:16:28,810 --> 01:16:29,170
Ya Know,

2674
01:16:29,170 --> 01:16:32,830
if I spent that much money on a car and
he had to like make my Dick Vigor and

2675
01:16:32,831 --> 01:16:34,240
fix all my problems in life,

2676
01:16:34,270 --> 01:16:34,790
well it's a,

2677
01:16:34,790 --> 01:16:36,740
it's a goddamn space ship that,

2678
01:16:36,880 --> 01:16:37,750
that Lamborghini,

2679
01:16:37,751 --> 01:16:38,340
but it's,

2680
01:16:38,340 --> 01:16:39,340
it's just so ridiculous.

2681
01:16:39,341 --> 01:16:41,800
He can't make it not break thought.

2682
01:16:41,800 --> 01:16:42,790
Fuck man.

2683
01:16:43,420 --> 01:16:44,710
Jesus Christ.

2684
01:16:45,280 --> 01:16:46,450
You're getting angry over there.

2685
01:16:46,510 --> 01:16:47,380
I'm a little mad.

2686
01:16:47,950 --> 01:16:48,551
I'm a little mad.

2687
01:16:48,551 --> 01:16:49,510
They can't get it together.

2688
01:16:49,570 --> 01:16:51,010
Expensive cars should not break.

2689
01:16:51,040 --> 01:16:51,873
They do though.

2690
01:16:51,910 --> 01:16:52,900
Those are the ones that break,

2691
01:16:53,200 --> 01:16:53,411
you know,

2692
01:16:53,411 --> 01:16:55,300
it doesn't break Honda accords.

2693
01:16:55,570 --> 01:16:58,630
Those motherfuckers are bulletproof
because if they break them,

2694
01:16:58,631 --> 01:17:01,690
they do a recall a Subaru
and drive through the snow.

2695
01:17:01,691 --> 01:17:02,710
You'll never get stuck.

2696
01:17:03,310 --> 01:17:04,143
You know?

2697
01:17:04,300 --> 01:17:04,721
Look at that.

2698
01:17:04,721 --> 01:17:06,250
There's a Lamborghini Aventador.

2699
01:17:06,550 --> 01:17:08,590
I mean that might as well
be a God damn spaceship.

2700
01:17:09,080 --> 01:17:11,570
Is that a Mercia Lago events
door broken down in London?

2701
01:17:11,600 --> 01:17:11,691
Oh,

2702
01:17:11,691 --> 01:17:12,560
it's broken down.

2703
01:17:12,750 --> 01:17:13,583
Ha.

2704
01:17:14,510 --> 01:17:15,860
That's hilarious.

2705
01:17:16,190 --> 01:17:16,341
Yeah,

2706
01:17:16,341 --> 01:17:16,881
they break,

2707
01:17:16,881 --> 01:17:17,270
man.

2708
01:17:17,270 --> 01:17:19,130
There were not really designed to be used.

2709
01:17:19,190 --> 01:17:20,060
They just cool.

2710
01:17:20,150 --> 01:17:23,780
They're just a massive feat of
engineering and twisted steel.

2711
01:17:24,150 --> 01:17:28,730
Oh quarter together with fucking screws
and they just stomp on that explosion

2712
01:17:28,731 --> 01:17:32,300
box they call an engine and hope it
all stays together as it rattles apart.

2713
01:17:33,110 --> 01:17:34,760
Plus it's built by guineas.

2714
01:17:34,910 --> 01:17:36,110
Don't trust my people,

2715
01:17:36,650 --> 01:17:38,150
my people not to be trusted with,

2716
01:17:38,240 --> 01:17:41,510
with very like fine technical things.

2717
01:17:42,100 --> 01:17:43,400
It mean Ferrari.

2718
01:17:43,401 --> 01:17:46,490
The only reason why they keep it together
as their rich heritage and racing and

2719
01:17:46,491 --> 01:17:48,380
their ego and winning racing.

2720
01:17:48,710 --> 01:17:50,330
Because if you take all
that out of the loop,

2721
01:17:50,360 --> 01:17:53,150
there are a bunch of guineas to
a bunch of guineas building cars.

2722
01:17:53,480 --> 01:17:54,440
You really trust him.

2723
01:17:54,830 --> 01:17:56,930
They're going to stare at
some chicks ass walking by.

2724
01:17:56,931 --> 01:18:00,050
I forget a screw and you're fucking wheels
going to go flying off when you're on

2725
01:18:00,051 --> 01:18:00,884
turn three.

2726
01:18:00,950 --> 01:18:01,131
I mean,

2727
01:18:01,131 --> 01:18:04,670
you guys are the only people
that originally borrowed
technology from Chinese

2728
01:18:04,671 --> 01:18:05,504
people.

2729
01:18:06,470 --> 01:18:07,310
This is one word.

2730
01:18:07,311 --> 01:18:08,540
Guy Gets hit by a car.

2731
01:18:08,570 --> 01:18:09,351
If you back that up,

2732
01:18:09,351 --> 01:18:09,921
you could see it.

2733
01:18:09,921 --> 01:18:11,090
You didn't see it in this video.

2734
01:18:11,310 --> 01:18:11,781
If you look at this,

2735
01:18:11,781 --> 01:18:12,710
boom.

2736
01:18:12,760 --> 01:18:13,200
Okay.

2737
01:18:13,200 --> 01:18:15,830
I turns right into him like a spastic.

2738
01:18:16,160 --> 01:18:21,160
The dude has a right away to and
boom and that's a $488,000 car.

2739
01:18:21,680 --> 01:18:21,951
Yeah,

2740
01:18:21,951 --> 01:18:22,910
it's snapped in half.

2741
01:18:23,150 --> 01:18:26,540
Apparently the cars are designed to
break away like that and the event of a

2742
01:18:26,570 --> 01:18:27,650
serious collision.

2743
01:18:27,950 --> 01:18:29,390
That's an Aventador.

2744
01:18:29,480 --> 01:18:29,591
Oh,

2745
01:18:29,591 --> 01:18:30,680
that's the carbon fiber.

2746
01:18:30,681 --> 01:18:33,020
While the Lamborghini Aventador.

2747
01:18:33,080 --> 01:18:33,770
Wow.

2748
01:18:33,770 --> 01:18:34,910
There anything made by guineas.

2749
01:18:34,911 --> 01:18:37,130
They take long breaks in
the middle of the day.

2750
01:18:37,131 --> 01:18:38,150
They take naps,

2751
01:18:38,450 --> 01:18:39,770
they drink wine at work.

2752
01:18:39,771 --> 01:18:41,240
Those people are fucking savages.

2753
01:18:41,241 --> 01:18:44,180
All they're thinking about is putting
that car together and making enough money

2754
01:18:44,181 --> 01:18:45,890
so that they can just fuck for six months.

2755
01:18:46,550 --> 01:18:47,630
Great track suits though.

2756
01:18:47,710 --> 01:18:47,870
Yeah.

2757
01:18:47,870 --> 01:18:49,070
They make good track suits.

2758
01:18:49,100 --> 01:18:50,220
They were wearing

2759
01:18:53,310 --> 01:18:55,520
tracksuits still fly in New York.

2760
01:18:55,830 --> 01:18:57,290
La has not embraced the tracksuit.

2761
01:18:57,650 --> 01:18:58,483
Never did.

2762
01:18:58,520 --> 01:19:00,650
If you like show up and you're
hanging around a track suit,

2763
01:19:00,830 --> 01:19:03,080
they assume you're either
Armenian or you're from New York.

2764
01:19:04,160 --> 01:19:07,370
Armenians can Baraka track
suit in La Nla they're great,

2765
01:19:07,371 --> 01:19:07,550
man.

2766
01:19:07,550 --> 01:19:09,590
I don't fuck with buttons
or zippers anymore.

2767
01:19:09,730 --> 01:19:10,460
Smart.

2768
01:19:10,460 --> 01:19:13,940
I should have been on that a long time
ago because I'm not scared of a fanny

2769
01:19:13,941 --> 01:19:14,660
pack.

2770
01:19:14,660 --> 01:19:17,240
Fanny pack with a track suit
is an excellent combination.

2771
01:19:17,390 --> 01:19:20,860
I'd rather just be fat and wear elastic
bands and look awesome and perfect,

2772
01:19:20,890 --> 01:19:21,890
but even if you're skinny,

2773
01:19:21,891 --> 01:19:22,641
it's still comfortable.

2774
01:19:22,641 --> 01:19:24,110
I'm just going to wear pajamas.

2775
01:19:25,610 --> 01:19:27,830
I'm just wearing like
weather resistant pajamas.

2776
01:19:27,860 --> 01:19:28,790
That's the best.

2777
01:19:28,820 --> 01:19:31,410
Rodney Dangerfield back
and is back in the dizzy.

2778
01:19:31,480 --> 01:19:33,300
I'm used to go on stage.

2779
01:19:33,510 --> 01:19:35,240
Rondi would wear a bathrobe,

2780
01:19:35,300 --> 01:19:38,570
nothing on underneath and with
slippers and just walk on stage.

2781
01:19:38,990 --> 01:19:39,890
And it was because,

2782
01:19:40,070 --> 01:19:40,610
you know,

2783
01:19:40,610 --> 01:19:41,690
it prevented,

2784
01:19:41,810 --> 01:19:42,860
I think it prevented,

2785
01:19:43,070 --> 01:19:43,400
uh,

2786
01:19:43,400 --> 01:19:46,220
you know anybody from taking him seriously
because he's not out there with a

2787
01:19:46,221 --> 01:19:46,761
suit on.

2788
01:19:46,761 --> 01:19:47,210
I mean,

2789
01:19:47,210 --> 01:19:48,170
right away you're like,

2790
01:19:48,171 --> 01:19:49,010
you're laughing and you're like,

2791
01:19:49,011 --> 01:19:49,131
look,

2792
01:19:49,131 --> 01:19:49,840
we have Rodney.

2793
01:19:49,840 --> 01:19:50,870
He opened shirt.

2794
01:19:50,900 --> 01:19:51,381
So you know,

2795
01:19:51,381 --> 01:19:54,050
it was obvious it was nothing on
underneath there wearing slippers.

2796
01:19:54,280 --> 01:19:55,340
But it was also,

2797
01:19:55,341 --> 01:19:59,420
he was so loose because he came out
there with a bathrobe on that he was just

2798
01:19:59,870 --> 01:20:01,990
giving no fucks out there.

2799
01:20:02,130 --> 01:20:05,000
Powerful Rodney Dangerfield
for Rodney Dangerfield and he,

2800
01:20:05,001 --> 01:20:06,110
that was an original move.

2801
01:20:06,130 --> 01:20:10,230
I'd never heard anybody doing that before
him and he did it later in his career,

2802
01:20:10,380 --> 01:20:12,300
so it was most likely born out of one day.

2803
01:20:12,301 --> 01:20:14,330
He was backstage in his
bathrobe and they said,

2804
01:20:14,331 --> 01:20:14,701
Rodney,

2805
01:20:14,701 --> 01:20:15,360
you're on.

2806
01:20:15,360 --> 01:20:15,721
And he's like,

2807
01:20:15,721 --> 01:20:16,051
okay,

2808
01:20:16,051 --> 01:20:18,180
I'm on fucking put it lay.

2809
01:20:18,181 --> 01:20:18,900
There he is.

2810
01:20:18,900 --> 01:20:22,170
That's how he used to walk and his
package was always hanging out.

2811
01:20:22,570 --> 01:20:22,890
Wow.

2812
01:20:22,890 --> 01:20:24,310
Apparently at a monster hog too.

2813
01:20:24,690 --> 01:20:25,523
He didn't give a fuck.

2814
01:20:25,850 --> 01:20:28,740
Meet Peeping Rodney
Dangerfield and there wasn't a,

2815
01:20:28,741 --> 01:20:29,101
what was it,

2816
01:20:29,101 --> 01:20:30,690
bread skeleton or something.

2817
01:20:30,691 --> 01:20:32,130
Who was the guy who ran the famous

2818
01:20:32,330 --> 01:20:33,163
Milton Berle?

2819
01:20:33,260 --> 01:20:33,351
Oh,

2820
01:20:33,351 --> 01:20:37,370
Milton Berle famous for his giant
hog and his love of stolen jokes.

2821
01:20:38,130 --> 01:20:40,140
Famous joke thief with a giant hug.

2822
01:20:40,850 --> 01:20:42,440
That was the word back in the day,

2823
01:20:42,560 --> 01:20:45,200
but I think joke thief was a
different sort of thing back then.

2824
01:20:45,410 --> 01:20:50,240
I think they all had like gags and they
use them into the interchange them like

2825
01:20:50,280 --> 01:20:51,610
guy would work the Catskills,

2826
01:20:51,620 --> 01:20:52,490
then another guy would work.

2827
01:20:52,610 --> 01:20:54,140
They would do like a lot
of the same material.

2828
01:20:54,740 --> 01:20:56,720
There was nobody writing
anything down back then.

2829
01:20:56,750 --> 01:20:59,540
There was no blogs or people
get shit on you for doing that.

2830
01:20:59,541 --> 01:21:00,374
There was also,

2831
01:21:00,380 --> 01:21:01,790
if you steal someone's joke now,

2832
01:21:01,791 --> 01:21:02,624
is it a big deal?

2833
01:21:02,630 --> 01:21:02,931
Yeah.

2834
01:21:02,931 --> 01:21:05,150
If you get caught stealing
someone's joke now you're fucked.

2835
01:21:05,190 --> 01:21:05,810
Really?

2836
01:21:05,810 --> 01:21:06,201
Yeah.

2837
01:21:06,201 --> 01:21:07,070
This is about who?

2838
01:21:07,250 --> 01:21:08,150
By the Internet.

2839
01:21:08,180 --> 01:21:08,631
The Internet.

2840
01:21:08,631 --> 01:21:12,470
We'll find out and they'll expose
it and I think people won't take you

2841
01:21:12,471 --> 01:21:13,040
seriously.

2842
01:21:13,040 --> 01:21:13,721
What about your man,

2843
01:21:13,721 --> 01:21:14,554
Shiela booth?

2844
01:21:14,570 --> 01:21:15,051
Yeah,

2845
01:21:15,051 --> 01:21:17,580
we talking about that on the
podcast or was it before the Friday?

2846
01:21:18,140 --> 01:21:19,100
Before the podcast?

2847
01:21:19,370 --> 01:21:19,731
Yeah.

2848
01:21:19,731 --> 01:21:20,850
Apparently he um,

2849
01:21:20,900 --> 01:21:24,260
made a short film and it's an
almost an entire verbatim rip off,

2850
01:21:24,261 --> 01:21:26,990
including the imagery
of some old comic book.

2851
01:21:27,050 --> 01:21:27,883
Really.

2852
01:21:29,020 --> 01:21:30,160
Joe was telling me about it.

2853
01:21:30,310 --> 01:21:31,420
It sounded just like,

2854
01:21:31,421 --> 01:21:32,740
damn you got caught.

2855
01:21:32,890 --> 01:21:33,101
Yeah.

2856
01:21:33,101 --> 01:21:33,700
You got caught.

2857
01:21:33,700 --> 01:21:34,510
And what did he say?

2858
01:21:34,510 --> 01:21:34,930
I Dunno.

2859
01:21:34,930 --> 01:21:35,350
I mean he,

2860
01:21:35,350 --> 01:21:37,170
he's pulling it down and um,

2861
01:21:37,310 --> 01:21:39,490
I dunno if he's actually made a public,

2862
01:21:39,850 --> 01:21:43,360
I'm sure if I just Google
Shaya I forgive him.

2863
01:21:43,390 --> 01:21:44,890
I loved him and transformers.

2864
01:21:46,120 --> 01:21:47,290
Ah,

2865
01:21:47,710 --> 01:21:48,071
uh,

2866
01:21:48,071 --> 01:21:48,461
okay.

2867
01:21:48,461 --> 01:21:50,770
Let's plagiarism pool age or,

2868
01:21:50,771 --> 01:21:51,070
Yup.

2869
01:21:51,070 --> 01:21:51,903
That's it.

2870
01:21:52,760 --> 01:21:54,710
That is my favorite
thing to do in la though.

2871
01:21:54,711 --> 01:21:57,710
People try to like stunt on you at
parties about their new projects,

2872
01:21:57,711 --> 01:21:57,820
like,

2873
01:21:57,820 --> 01:21:57,921
oh,

2874
01:21:57,921 --> 01:22:00,770
I have a project with so and so and
I'll just pick their worst movie and be

2875
01:22:00,771 --> 01:22:00,890
like,

2876
01:22:00,890 --> 01:22:02,720
I loved him and transformers,

2877
01:22:03,050 --> 01:22:04,520
or I loved him in Van Wilder.

2878
01:22:04,521 --> 01:22:05,660
Like that's my favorite thing to do.

2879
01:22:05,661 --> 01:22:07,280
Someone was telling me about what they do.

2880
01:22:07,900 --> 01:22:08,660
They'll just be like,

2881
01:22:08,660 --> 01:22:08,871
oh,

2882
01:22:08,871 --> 01:22:11,180
I got this guy and I'm doing
this new movie with him.

2883
01:22:11,181 --> 01:22:12,440
You're going to see them
in a whole New Light.

2884
01:22:12,441 --> 01:22:12,741
And I was like,

2885
01:22:12,741 --> 01:22:13,041
you know what?

2886
01:22:13,041 --> 01:22:15,260
I'd love to see Ryan
metals in Van Wilder too.

2887
01:22:15,880 --> 01:22:16,301
Wow,

2888
01:22:16,301 --> 01:22:16,810
okay.

2889
01:22:16,810 --> 01:22:17,830
In a series of tweets,

2890
01:22:17,831 --> 01:22:21,640
he admitted on Tuesday that he fucked up
in quotes by failing to acknowledge the

2891
01:22:21,641 --> 01:22:25,570
short film he passed off as an
original work was actually inspired by,

2892
01:22:25,571 --> 01:22:30,370
if not an entire rip off of a
graphic novella written by artists.

2893
01:22:30,371 --> 01:22:34,840
Daniel close by way of apology
laboo is that what you're saying?

2894
01:22:34,860 --> 01:22:35,693
The booth,

2895
01:22:35,860 --> 01:22:36,730
that's what he deserves.

2896
01:22:36,731 --> 01:22:41,731
The tweeted in that his excitement
and naivete as an amateur film maker,

2897
01:22:41,861 --> 01:22:45,550
he got lost in the creative process
and neglected to follow proper

2898
01:22:45,551 --> 01:22:46,384
accreditation.

2899
01:22:46,480 --> 01:22:47,530
Wow.

2900
01:22:47,560 --> 01:22:48,100
That's not,

2901
01:22:48,100 --> 01:22:49,210
that's nonsense.

2902
01:22:49,240 --> 01:22:54,070
I want Alec Baldwin to release a statement
about this naivete and excitement may

2903
01:22:54,071 --> 01:22:56,770
well have played their part in this
fairly brazen breach of etiquette.

2904
01:22:56,771 --> 01:22:57,740
But considering the booze,

2905
01:22:57,741 --> 01:22:59,560
previous run ins with plagiarism,

2906
01:22:59,920 --> 01:23:00,790
oh my God,

2907
01:23:00,791 --> 01:23:01,870
he did something else.

2908
01:23:03,850 --> 01:23:04,301
What is it?

2909
01:23:04,301 --> 01:23:05,530
What did this guy before?

2910
01:23:05,531 --> 01:23:07,300
What was he accused of before?

2911
01:23:07,990 --> 01:23:09,310
But stealing dining clouds,

2912
01:23:09,311 --> 01:23:10,091
you're going to get caught.

2913
01:23:10,091 --> 01:23:10,510
I mean,

2914
01:23:10,510 --> 01:23:11,350
he's a famous,

2915
01:23:12,400 --> 01:23:12,791
yeah,

2916
01:23:12,791 --> 01:23:13,940
well he's this guy.

2917
01:23:13,941 --> 01:23:14,860
He's not that smart

2918
01:23:16,740 --> 01:23:19,150
answers to think they're
way smarter than they are.

2919
01:23:19,300 --> 01:23:21,970
They get really confused because
everybody listens to him on the set.

2920
01:23:22,150 --> 01:23:23,200
And that's how they judge.

2921
01:23:23,230 --> 01:23:23,871
Like they're,

2922
01:23:23,871 --> 01:23:25,720
they're like their ecosystem.

2923
01:23:25,840 --> 01:23:26,081
Like,

2924
01:23:26,081 --> 01:23:27,580
oh well obviously I'm a fucking big deal.

2925
01:23:27,640 --> 01:23:27,881
You know,

2926
01:23:27,881 --> 01:23:31,740
like I know you're a big deal on a set
and the people are delusional and they,

2927
01:23:31,810 --> 01:23:31,961
well,

2928
01:23:31,961 --> 01:23:33,250
you're delusional because people are,

2929
01:23:33,310 --> 01:23:34,550
they're not being honest with you all.

2930
01:23:34,870 --> 01:23:36,610
And then you go to a red
carpet thing and they're not,

2931
01:23:36,611 --> 01:23:36,881
you know,

2932
01:23:36,881 --> 01:23:37,930
you're doing transformers.

2933
01:23:37,931 --> 01:23:39,550
Everyone's throwing fucking softballs at.

2934
01:23:39,551 --> 01:23:40,030
Yeah.

2935
01:23:40,030 --> 01:23:40,863
So you're,

2936
01:23:40,970 --> 01:23:43,300
you're super confused as to
where you are in the world.

2937
01:23:43,720 --> 01:23:44,261
So you think,

2938
01:23:44,261 --> 01:23:44,441
wow,

2939
01:23:44,441 --> 01:23:46,990
just rip off this fucking old school.

2940
01:23:46,991 --> 01:23:47,824
He comic book.

2941
01:23:48,220 --> 01:23:48,491
I mean,

2942
01:23:48,491 --> 01:23:50,580
him and Bumblebee are
still legends to me too.

2943
01:23:51,130 --> 01:23:51,641
So Real,

2944
01:23:51,641 --> 01:23:55,390
real recent comic book to 2007 comic dump,

2945
01:23:55,391 --> 01:23:58,330
Fuck Dumb Fuck.

2946
01:23:58,810 --> 01:24:00,670
Copying isn't particularly creative,

2947
01:24:01,270 --> 01:24:02,200
creative work,

2948
01:24:02,380 --> 01:24:06,130
being inspired by someone else's idea to
produce something new and different is

2949
01:24:06,131 --> 01:24:06,964
creative work.

2950
01:24:07,300 --> 01:24:08,380
What does that mean?

2951
01:24:09,550 --> 01:24:11,020
That's one of the
dumbest things I've ever,

2952
01:24:11,170 --> 01:24:12,580
that's like the weirdest,

2953
01:24:14,740 --> 01:24:19,740
weirdest admission slash ego chest puff
copying is in particularly creative

2954
01:24:20,561 --> 01:24:21,130
work,

2955
01:24:21,130 --> 01:24:24,640
being inspired by someone else's work to
produce something new and different is

2956
01:24:24,641 --> 01:24:25,360
creative work.

2957
01:24:25,360 --> 01:24:25,660
But,

2958
01:24:25,660 --> 01:24:28,660
but he copied and he also said,

2959
01:24:28,880 --> 01:24:30,010
I didn't mean to copy,

2960
01:24:30,011 --> 01:24:31,090
I forgot to acknowledge it,

2961
01:24:31,120 --> 01:24:33,040
but uh,

2962
01:24:33,100 --> 01:24:34,270
I was creative anyway.

2963
01:24:34,330 --> 01:24:38,170
And they're also saying that his
apology might've been plagiarized.

2964
01:24:38,560 --> 01:24:39,370
No Way.

2965
01:24:39,370 --> 01:24:40,203
Yes.

2966
01:24:40,540 --> 01:24:43,840
His apology apparently looks familiar
to someone else's apology for,

2967
01:24:44,470 --> 01:24:44,981
for,

2968
01:24:44,981 --> 01:24:45,520
um,

2969
01:24:45,520 --> 01:24:46,300
for doing that.

2970
01:24:46,300 --> 01:24:47,650
Oh my goodness.

2971
01:24:49,540 --> 01:24:49,751
Oh,

2972
01:24:49,751 --> 01:24:52,180
he took the Picasso quote
is what they trying to say?

2973
01:24:52,990 --> 01:24:53,823
No.

2974
01:24:54,100 --> 01:24:54,510
Did,

2975
01:24:54,510 --> 01:24:55,510
did he say that?

2976
01:24:55,600 --> 01:24:57,040
I guess he paraphrased.

2977
01:24:57,100 --> 01:24:57,731
No,

2978
01:24:57,731 --> 01:24:58,241
that's not,

2979
01:24:58,241 --> 01:24:58,540
that's,

2980
01:24:58,540 --> 01:24:59,560
that's nitpicking.

2981
01:24:59,580 --> 01:25:00,100
Yeah.

2982
01:25:00,100 --> 01:25:01,840
Unless they have a better exam,

2983
01:25:02,410 --> 01:25:03,820
plagiarized and apology.

2984
01:25:03,821 --> 01:25:07,060
I actually would've like giving
him props and like that's amazing.

2985
01:25:07,190 --> 01:25:11,890
Got The talent that you thought to
plagiarizing policy like you so cold and

2986
01:25:11,891 --> 01:25:14,230
don't give a fuck that I now love you.

2987
01:25:14,350 --> 01:25:14,801
Yeah.

2988
01:25:14,801 --> 01:25:16,060
Maybe puts blinders on.

2989
01:25:16,061 --> 01:25:18,660
Just fucking plows right through it all.

2990
01:25:18,700 --> 01:25:21,640
We put this merely copying is
in particularly creative work,

2991
01:25:22,150 --> 01:25:23,920
although it's useful
and training practice,

2992
01:25:23,921 --> 01:25:26,860
being inspired by someone else's idea to
produce something new and different is

2993
01:25:26,861 --> 01:25:31,060
creative work and it may have even
washed analyze the stolen concept.

2994
01:25:31,240 --> 01:25:33,280
Oh my God did steal it.

2995
01:25:33,460 --> 01:25:33,790
Wow.

2996
01:25:33,790 --> 01:25:35,230
From now or years ago.

2997
01:25:35,231 --> 01:25:37,030
Look at that answered four years ago.

2998
01:25:37,180 --> 01:25:39,070
You scumbag.

2999
01:25:39,670 --> 01:25:39,851
Oh,

3000
01:25:39,851 --> 01:25:41,200
he's one of those guys.

3001
01:25:41,350 --> 01:25:42,370
He's one of those guys.

3002
01:25:42,371 --> 01:25:43,570
He doesn't have his own thoughts.

3003
01:25:43,630 --> 01:25:45,070
Next time I get in an argument,

3004
01:25:45,071 --> 01:25:47,200
I'm going to just
plagiarize Shiela booths.

3005
01:25:47,200 --> 01:25:48,033
Apologies.

3006
01:25:48,380 --> 01:25:50,290
Start sending them via email to people.

3007
01:25:50,320 --> 01:25:50,441
Well,

3008
01:25:50,441 --> 01:25:54,700
that makes sense because that's w that's
sort of how I perceive a lot of actors.

3009
01:25:54,880 --> 01:25:59,530
I always perceive a lot of actors being
completely delusional and also being

3010
01:25:59,531 --> 01:26:00,670
completely fraudulent,

3011
01:26:00,790 --> 01:26:02,470
like not giving you who they really are,

3012
01:26:02,471 --> 01:26:06,200
but giving you what they think would be
nice if you thought of them and that's

3013
01:26:06,201 --> 01:26:09,020
clearly what he did by
not just plagiarizing,

3014
01:26:09,021 --> 01:26:11,090
but by plagiarizing the fucking apology.

3015
01:26:11,580 --> 01:26:11,840
Yes.

3016
01:26:11,840 --> 01:26:16,840
Obviously he this dump fuck
even capitalize the his as well.

3017
01:26:18,300 --> 01:26:19,220
He's such a dump.

3018
01:26:19,221 --> 01:26:20,054
Cut.

3019
01:26:21,190 --> 01:26:21,620
He did.

3020
01:26:21,620 --> 01:26:25,220
He caught plagiarizing
Charles boot Koski oh shit.

3021
01:26:25,250 --> 01:26:26,690
Oh my God.

3022
01:26:27,500 --> 01:26:31,010
Cause this is this the old
problem that he had six hours ago.

3023
01:26:31,160 --> 01:26:32,870
Oh Jesus Christ.

3024
01:26:32,871 --> 01:26:37,090
How did he plagiarized boot Koski
I don't even want to know you.

3025
01:26:37,190 --> 01:26:38,240
Fuck this dummy.

3026
01:26:38,320 --> 01:26:39,170
He stole the plot

3027
01:26:39,330 --> 01:26:41,850
from a poet,

3028
01:26:41,851 --> 01:26:44,220
Charles mccalsky and author Ben Wa.

3029
01:26:44,760 --> 01:26:45,593
I'm not going to say it.

3030
01:26:45,630 --> 01:26:46,021
Oh,

3031
01:26:46,021 --> 01:26:46,854
who cares.

3032
01:26:47,820 --> 01:26:51,210
I'm going to bootleg bootlegger Yan can
cook episode and turn it in Shane and

3033
01:26:51,260 --> 01:26:52,900
then send you shy the boobs.

3034
01:26:52,930 --> 01:26:56,190
A policy via email and capitalize is,

3035
01:26:57,890 --> 01:26:58,740
that's what comedian,

3036
01:26:58,741 --> 01:26:59,191
I'm sorry,

3037
01:26:59,191 --> 01:27:02,280
I forgot to credit Martin
Yan for this episode.

3038
01:27:02,350 --> 01:27:07,300
He plagiarize his fucking apology
from Yahoo answers you dumb,

3039
01:27:07,440 --> 01:27:07,891
dumb,

3040
01:27:07,891 --> 01:27:08,724
dumb dumb.

3041
01:27:09,320 --> 01:27:11,160
But you were right earlier you said,

3042
01:27:11,161 --> 01:27:11,430
look,

3043
01:27:11,430 --> 01:27:14,220
you do anything on the Internet and yeah,

3044
01:27:14,221 --> 01:27:16,200
you can't get away with
that kind of stupid shit.

3045
01:27:16,201 --> 01:27:16,500
Right.

3046
01:27:16,500 --> 01:27:16,831
All Day.

3047
01:27:16,831 --> 01:27:21,210
He's been re tweeting people's respond
or apologies like major apologies over

3048
01:27:21,211 --> 01:27:21,931
the last couple of years.

3049
01:27:21,931 --> 01:27:22,764
Like Tigers,

3050
01:27:22,770 --> 01:27:23,391
major apology.

3051
01:27:23,391 --> 01:27:23,530
Yeah.

3052
01:27:23,530 --> 01:27:24,490
In 2009,

3053
01:27:25,120 --> 01:27:25,953
um,

3054
01:27:26,080 --> 01:27:28,510
Kanye is response to Taylor
swift when he took over her.

3055
01:27:28,511 --> 01:27:29,010
And what does he do?

3056
01:27:29,010 --> 01:27:29,330
Oh,

3057
01:27:29,330 --> 01:27:30,070
retreating them.

3058
01:27:30,070 --> 01:27:34,540
He's just doing that to try to try
to cover up the fact they got caught

3059
01:27:34,720 --> 01:27:35,531
plagiarizing.

3060
01:27:35,531 --> 01:27:37,600
Not just somebody who's
work but an apology.

3061
01:27:37,660 --> 01:27:38,560
She's now a victim just,

3062
01:27:39,130 --> 01:27:39,281
well,

3063
01:27:39,281 --> 01:27:40,240
I don't think he's doing that.

3064
01:27:40,241 --> 01:27:43,780
I think he's just throwing a bunch
of fucking decoys up in the air.

3065
01:27:44,230 --> 01:27:44,531
I mean,

3066
01:27:44,531 --> 01:27:46,150
he's just tweeting a bunch of shit.

3067
01:27:46,180 --> 01:27:46,541
Oh yeah,

3068
01:27:46,541 --> 01:27:46,960
that,

3069
01:27:46,960 --> 01:27:47,131
well,

3070
01:27:47,131 --> 01:27:49,330
I also tweeted Kanye West's apology.

3071
01:27:49,480 --> 01:27:53,770
I also tweeted that is the best way
to get people distracted though,

3072
01:27:53,771 --> 01:27:54,970
is if you're in some shit right now.

3073
01:27:54,971 --> 01:27:55,091
Like,

3074
01:27:55,091 --> 01:27:55,241
Hey,

3075
01:27:55,241 --> 01:27:56,830
have you seen this Kanye West interview?

3076
01:27:56,940 --> 01:27:57,250
Yeah.

3077
01:27:57,250 --> 01:27:59,620
But that's kind of the easiest
way to get people distracted.

3078
01:27:59,680 --> 01:28:00,580
That's a good way.

3079
01:28:01,010 --> 01:28:01,360
Yeah.

3080
01:28:01,360 --> 01:28:02,193
Which is the Connie,

3081
01:28:02,210 --> 01:28:02,980
which one?

3082
01:28:02,980 --> 01:28:03,813
Any of them.

3083
01:28:03,940 --> 01:28:04,840
Him caught himself.

3084
01:28:04,841 --> 01:28:05,790
Michelangelo.

3085
01:28:05,810 --> 01:28:05,960
Okay.

3086
01:28:05,960 --> 01:28:07,370
You don't got dance a saying,

3087
01:28:07,371 --> 01:28:08,510
you don't got the answers.

3088
01:28:09,230 --> 01:28:11,630
I'm Michelangelo in the flesh.

3089
01:28:12,230 --> 01:28:12,381
You,

3090
01:28:12,381 --> 01:28:17,381
we need the family to step up
and recognize I'm in the flesh.

3091
01:28:18,990 --> 01:28:20,270
Nike is a slave master.

3092
01:28:20,271 --> 01:28:20,571
I was like,

3093
01:28:20,571 --> 01:28:21,440
what the fuck dude?

3094
01:28:21,530 --> 01:28:24,740
Rap Stars are the Rock Stars
and I'm the biggest one.

3095
01:28:25,430 --> 01:28:26,263
Aww.

3096
01:28:27,320 --> 01:28:28,340
That's so silly.

3097
01:28:28,460 --> 01:28:31,460
You don't get to be the biggest one if
you say that because that's not something

3098
01:28:31,461 --> 01:28:33,110
you would ever imagine Mick Jagger Sang.

3099
01:28:33,260 --> 01:28:33,471
Right?

3100
01:28:33,471 --> 01:28:33,800
Right.

3101
01:28:33,800 --> 01:28:36,320
Do you think that Bono from
u two would ever say that?

3102
01:28:36,510 --> 01:28:37,000
Who you know,

3103
01:28:37,000 --> 01:28:38,090
rock stars don't say that.

3104
01:28:38,180 --> 01:28:39,013
They just live it.

3105
01:28:39,260 --> 01:28:39,771
You live it.

3106
01:28:39,771 --> 01:28:40,341
You don't say,

3107
01:28:40,341 --> 01:28:41,270
let everybody else say it.

3108
01:28:41,271 --> 01:28:42,650
When you start saying it yourself,

3109
01:28:42,980 --> 01:28:43,880
you're not that.

3110
01:28:44,030 --> 01:28:44,661
That's not you.

3111
01:28:44,661 --> 01:28:46,990
You're not that bad because
of real bad motherfuckers.

3112
01:28:47,030 --> 01:28:50,840
Bad motherfucker across the board and
bad motherfuckers don't brag like that.

3113
01:28:51,200 --> 01:28:54,560
Especially saying stupid
shit like I'm Michelangelo.

3114
01:28:54,561 --> 01:28:55,394
I'm Disney.

3115
01:28:55,580 --> 01:28:55,881
No,

3116
01:28:55,881 --> 01:28:56,480
you're not.

3117
01:28:56,480 --> 01:28:57,740
Because they wouldn't say that.

3118
01:28:57,920 --> 01:28:58,390
They're not.

3119
01:28:58,390 --> 01:29:01,920
They're not comparing themselves
to the previous people and

3120
01:29:02,010 --> 01:29:04,290
some loudy shouty sort of way.

3121
01:29:04,620 --> 01:29:05,340
That's silly.

3122
01:29:05,340 --> 01:29:06,630
You would like a v neck on.

3123
01:29:07,110 --> 01:29:07,943
Yeah.

3124
01:29:07,970 --> 01:29:09,930
You're fucking silence
white tee shirts on.

3125
01:29:10,170 --> 01:29:14,040
It's the idea behind it is preposterous
that a guy's going to yell out that he's

3126
01:29:14,041 --> 01:29:17,880
not getting his just due and he's
the Disney and he's the Steve Jobs.

3127
01:29:17,881 --> 01:29:18,331
He's like,

3128
01:29:18,331 --> 01:29:19,410
come on man.

3129
01:29:19,590 --> 01:29:20,610
No you're not.

3130
01:29:20,700 --> 01:29:25,700
That's exactly proof that you're not and
because you saying you are and the guys

3131
01:29:25,831 --> 01:29:28,320
who are don't say they're
somebody else like that.

3132
01:29:28,420 --> 01:29:29,280
It just do.

3133
01:29:29,310 --> 01:29:33,750
The funniest reason too is that his
reason for being so mad and talking about

3134
01:29:33,990 --> 01:29:34,823
being a new slave,

3135
01:29:34,830 --> 01:29:37,530
it's because he can't
break into fashion now.

3136
01:29:37,531 --> 01:29:39,240
It makes no fucking sense.

3137
01:29:39,241 --> 01:29:40,140
Doesn't have to make sense.

3138
01:29:40,141 --> 01:29:41,520
It's all fueled by ego.

3139
01:29:41,740 --> 01:29:42,573
It's just this

3140
01:29:43,880 --> 01:29:48,880
ego that he has to dam up doesn't
even want to do like high end female.

3141
01:29:50,460 --> 01:29:51,260
Yeah,

3142
01:29:51,260 --> 01:29:52,093
not much.

3143
01:29:52,260 --> 01:29:53,093
And you're like,

3144
01:29:53,370 --> 01:29:54,830
oh you want to,

3145
01:29:55,220 --> 01:29:57,600
you wanna you wanna design dresses.

3146
01:29:59,520 --> 01:30:01,200
But it's so who gives a fuck?

3147
01:30:01,230 --> 01:30:02,063
Because it's like,

3148
01:30:02,070 --> 01:30:05,250
why are you yelling about
that on a rap radio station?

3149
01:30:06,340 --> 01:30:08,220
If you're going to dress
like Kim Kardashian,

3150
01:30:08,221 --> 01:30:09,330
it doesn't take much.

3151
01:30:09,610 --> 01:30:13,590
Just take some Reynold's
wrap clear Reynolds wrap and
wrap it around that bitch

3152
01:30:13,620 --> 01:30:15,600
like that is the best
thing she will look like.

3153
01:30:15,601 --> 01:30:16,500
Do you really believe that?

3154
01:30:16,890 --> 01:30:17,551
Do you really don't?

3155
01:30:17,551 --> 01:30:19,980
You don't think that there's like
probably addressed it with better than

3156
01:30:19,981 --> 01:30:20,520
surrender?

3157
01:30:20,520 --> 01:30:21,061
No,

3158
01:30:21,061 --> 01:30:23,580
I think her and Saran
wrap would be amazing.

3159
01:30:23,581 --> 01:30:26,400
I think there's a problem with Saran wrap
and a big problem is that the shit is

3160
01:30:26,401 --> 01:30:27,234
hard to get off.

3161
01:30:28,050 --> 01:30:30,710
Oh you got to like
fucking rip it and pull it

3162
01:30:32,250 --> 01:30:33,083
and go and dress,

3163
01:30:33,540 --> 01:30:36,870
hike that sucker up and if you
fuck a girl is covering Saran wrap,

3164
01:30:36,871 --> 01:30:38,370
their pitch is going to be sweaty.

3165
01:30:38,670 --> 01:30:42,610
It's going to be like rivers is sweat
coming out of the lower back and say,

3166
01:30:44,120 --> 01:30:44,310
man,

3167
01:30:44,310 --> 01:30:48,330
I was at this pimps and hoes party in
high school and I put this girl up there

3168
01:30:48,331 --> 01:30:51,570
was doing a keg stand and she just wore
Reynold's wrap when no underwear and I

3169
01:30:51,571 --> 01:30:51,751
was like,

3170
01:30:51,751 --> 01:30:52,630
this is the best dress

3171
01:30:52,750 --> 01:30:53,080
ever.

3172
01:30:53,080 --> 01:30:53,411
Hold on,

3173
01:30:53,411 --> 01:30:53,741
hold on,

3174
01:30:53,741 --> 01:30:54,041
hold on,

3175
01:30:54,041 --> 01:30:54,340
hold on,

3176
01:30:54,340 --> 01:30:54,791
hold on.

3177
01:30:54,791 --> 01:30:55,624
Hold on.

3178
01:30:56,230 --> 01:30:57,580
Halloween or this is what,

3179
01:30:57,840 --> 01:31:02,840
this is just what pimps and
hoes party [inaudible] party.

3180
01:31:05,440 --> 01:31:07,730
This is what people do in
coldest sags in Orlando.

3181
01:31:08,020 --> 01:31:08,710
Orlando.

3182
01:31:08,710 --> 01:31:09,011
Sorry.

3183
01:31:09,011 --> 01:31:10,210
What was the purpose of,

3184
01:31:10,211 --> 01:31:11,830
what was the purpose of the

3185
01:31:12,210 --> 01:31:13,860
of the Reynolds ripe to be sexy.

3186
01:31:14,070 --> 01:31:14,903
Yes.

3187
01:31:14,940 --> 01:31:16,200
That was her whole outfit.

3188
01:31:16,800 --> 01:31:17,340
Wow.

3189
01:31:17,340 --> 01:31:18,210
Well that works.

3190
01:31:18,450 --> 01:31:19,261
I mean that's obvious.

3191
01:31:19,261 --> 01:31:20,094
You're not classy.

3192
01:31:20,310 --> 01:31:20,521
You know,

3193
01:31:20,521 --> 01:31:21,660
you're wrapping yourself up in Wales.

3194
01:31:21,890 --> 01:31:25,160
You definitely hold on as her
underwear or that was her dress,

3195
01:31:25,520 --> 01:31:27,380
her dress and there was no underwear.

3196
01:31:27,410 --> 01:31:27,561
No,

3197
01:31:27,561 --> 01:31:28,394
there was no,

3198
01:31:28,820 --> 01:31:29,920
she went up there for the kid.

3199
01:31:29,921 --> 01:31:32,450
Thought I thought you said it
looked like she was selling Turkey,

3200
01:31:32,451 --> 01:31:33,920
but I thought you said she was,

3201
01:31:33,950 --> 01:31:35,150
she was going up for a,

3202
01:31:35,190 --> 01:31:35,981
a cake stand,

3203
01:31:35,981 --> 01:31:36,681
like wearing a dress.

3204
01:31:36,681 --> 01:31:39,810
The dress fell down and all
she was running as underwear.

3205
01:31:39,811 --> 01:31:41,180
It was rental drop and I was like,

3206
01:31:41,540 --> 01:31:41,661
oh,

3207
01:31:41,661 --> 01:31:42,450
she's a,

3208
01:31:42,450 --> 01:31:43,220
she's a freak.

3209
01:31:43,220 --> 01:31:43,401
You know,

3210
01:31:43,401 --> 01:31:44,090
she's a freak.

3211
01:31:44,090 --> 01:31:45,710
She was just wearing Reynold's wrap.

3212
01:31:46,690 --> 01:31:47,510
I don't think Turkey

3213
01:31:47,510 --> 01:31:48,860
Burger Line got enough respect.

3214
01:31:48,890 --> 01:31:49,370
I know.

3215
01:31:49,370 --> 01:31:54,230
Give it a little bit of a pause it Saran
wrap on both sides looking and you see

3216
01:31:54,231 --> 01:31:54,680
in the meat.

3217
01:31:54,680 --> 01:31:55,513
I like it.

3218
01:31:55,720 --> 01:31:56,151
I like it.

3219
01:31:56,151 --> 01:31:57,080
I like where you went with that.

3220
01:32:00,400 --> 01:32:02,110
Pimps and hoes party man.

3221
01:32:02,350 --> 01:32:03,580
Those fucking movies.

3222
01:32:03,581 --> 01:32:05,800
Pimps up hoes down the best.

3223
01:32:05,860 --> 01:32:06,820
Oh my God.

3224
01:32:06,880 --> 01:32:08,470
Those are real documentaries.

3225
01:32:11,930 --> 01:32:12,270
Yeah.

3226
01:32:12,270 --> 01:32:12,581
Yeah.

3227
01:32:12,581 --> 01:32:14,350
Mr. White for white folks,

This duty is to drive around his white
suits and they would get together and Mr.

3231
01:32:25,420 --> 01:32:25,450
White,

3232
01:32:25,450 --> 01:32:26,500
they would all like rap,

3233
01:32:26,501 --> 01:32:27,311
pimp style.

3234
01:32:27,311 --> 01:32:28,900
They will all like rap at each other.

3235
01:32:29,070 --> 01:32:29,501
I'm telling you,

3236

That is the white person.

Mount Rushmore.

people have slept on Mr. White folks.

3247
01:32:41,561 --> 01:32:42,640
You got to listen to him talk.

3248
01:32:42,930 --> 01:32:43,763
No.

3249
01:32:44,900 --> 01:32:45,111
Oh,

3250
01:32:45,111 --> 01:32:47,090
I really got my feet wet in the game,

3251
01:32:47,091 --> 01:32:47,690
right.

3252
01:32:47,690 --> 01:32:49,790
I was Eddy Moretti before I got my feet.

3253
01:32:50,160 --> 01:32:53,390
Just started calling me white folks
and ever since then it just stuck.

3254
01:32:55,350 --> 01:32:55,591
Look,

3255
01:32:55,591 --> 01:32:58,380

3256

I guess date function.

3257
01:33:00,691 --> 01:33:04,070

3258
01:33:04,080 --> 01:33:06,300
a global creative director of [inaudible].

3259
01:33:07,620 --> 01:33:09,060
I love his voice.

3260
01:33:10,760 --> 01:33:12,690
Africa like a can,

3261
01:33:12,691 --> 01:33:14,740
American southern slang thing.

3262
01:33:15,210 --> 01:33:16,043
You know

3263
01:33:16,590 --> 01:33:17,580
how to dress.

3264
01:33:18,390 --> 01:33:19,830
Look at this money and dollar bills,

3265
01:33:19,920 --> 01:33:20,760
how to finesse.

3266
01:33:22,290 --> 01:33:22,951
But you know,

3267
01:33:22,951 --> 01:33:24,600
I got educated in the hood.

3268
01:33:27,900 --> 01:33:28,710
I feel like a,

3269
01:33:28,710 --> 01:33:33,390
that was a blessing for me
being Caucasian and you know,

3270
01:33:33,391 --> 01:33:36,150
to be able to come to the
other side of the fence,

3271
01:33:36,151 --> 01:33:36,521
you know,

3272
01:33:36,521 --> 01:33:37,110
when uh,

3273
01:33:37,110 --> 01:33:39,780
be accepted and uh,

3274
01:33:39,781 --> 01:33:40,471
also,

3275
01:33:40,471 --> 01:33:41,230
uh,

3276
01:33:41,230 --> 01:33:41,580
you know,

3277
01:33:41,580 --> 01:33:43,470
being able to do some of the things that,

3278
01:33:43,471 --> 01:33:43,860
uh,

3279
01:33:43,860 --> 01:33:47,970
some of the likes of the past that
have done sort of like a ball capitol

3280
01:33:49,380 --> 01:33:51,280
football shirt and then just talk like,

3281
01:33:52,620 --> 01:33:53,453
or like,

3282
01:33:53,600 --> 01:33:54,000
you know,

3283
01:33:54,000 --> 01:33:54,833
in a suit,

3284
01:33:55,320 --> 01:33:57,720
IBM sales dude or whatever
you just talked about.

3285
01:33:57,721 --> 01:33:58,950
One thing about white girls,

3286
01:33:58,951 --> 01:33:59,420
you know,

3287
01:33:59,420 --> 01:34:00,270
this is my favorite.

3288
01:34:00,720 --> 01:34:03,210
They get less problems with the police.

3289
01:34:03,211 --> 01:34:04,044
You know,

3290
01:34:04,230 --> 01:34:05,520
they don't get that much daddy.

3291
01:34:07,620 --> 01:34:07,861
Well,

3292
01:34:07,861 --> 01:34:08,401
black vest,

3293
01:34:08,401 --> 01:34:10,510
we wanted to get in
the street next stupid,

3294
01:34:10,520 --> 01:34:10,891
you know,

3295
01:34:10,891 --> 01:34:15,720
be wanting to fight with the tricks and
fight with the police and talking crazy

3296
01:34:15,721 --> 01:34:16,554
and

3297
01:34:17,760 --> 01:34:19,650
she can't take care of
no business like that.

3298
01:34:19,960 --> 01:34:20,780
Yeah.

3299
01:34:20,780 --> 01:34:21,140
Like you know,

3300
01:34:21,140 --> 01:34:24,380
people love coffee and cigarettes
that shot at like deal Murray.

3301
01:34:24,381 --> 01:34:25,550
We had risen all of them,

3302
01:34:25,551 --> 01:34:30,551
but the best shot in a coffee shop ever
is those fuckers drinking soup at the

3303
01:34:30,951 --> 01:34:31,880
end of this girl.

3304
01:34:32,950 --> 01:34:34,040
That's the illest shot.

3305
01:34:34,041 --> 01:34:38,090
I think that the females respect the
game like they once did because there are

3306
01:34:38,330 --> 01:34:41,620
hundreds and hundreds of
thousands of renegades and out.

3307
01:34:41,750 --> 01:34:42,583
Wow.

3308
01:34:43,430 --> 01:34:46,220
That's a female working
and doesn't have a man.

3309
01:34:48,500 --> 01:34:50,320
Rarely comes into [inaudible].

3310
01:34:51,640 --> 01:34:52,473
Sure.

3311
01:34:52,920 --> 01:34:53,753
First of all,

3312
01:34:56,300 --> 01:34:57,200
hilarious

3313
01:34:57,560 --> 01:35:01,670
is not supposed to be looking at a pimp
when a pimp ride by this supposed to be

3314
01:35:01,671 --> 01:35:03,200
looking at the motherfucking curve

3315
01:35:05,060 --> 01:35:06,320
and when she looked up at a pimp,

3316
01:35:06,321 --> 01:35:08,450
she can't be broke for
reckless eyeballing.

3317
01:35:08,520 --> 01:35:09,940
Look at this guy chasing him around.

3318
01:35:09,941 --> 01:35:13,560
She can be broke for
reckless eyeballing reckless.

3319
01:35:15,140 --> 01:35:20,140
That means that she's making eye contact
with the Pippin and she may not even be

3320
01:35:20,451 --> 01:35:21,284
with that man.

3321
01:35:22,880 --> 01:35:23,121
You know,

3322
01:35:23,121 --> 01:35:24,980
that's the reason why I
say the game has changed.

3323
01:35:24,981 --> 01:35:27,080
In the old days she'd
be on the pimp arrests.

3324
01:35:30,180 --> 01:35:31,620
What a weird thing to be proud of.

3325
01:35:31,621 --> 01:35:36,621
So you know what a weird thing to be
proud of to be a guy who makes women sell

3326
01:35:36,871 --> 01:35:37,704
their bodies,

3327
01:35:37,800 --> 01:35:38,281
but you know,

3328
01:35:38,281 --> 01:35:39,960
talk about the things
that the great pimps,

3329
01:35:39,980 --> 01:35:40,813
the past.

3330
01:35:40,890 --> 01:35:44,070
I've been blessed to be able
to do some of that shit.

3331
01:35:44,071 --> 01:35:45,720
The great pimps that a pass.

3332
01:35:45,990 --> 01:35:46,570
What happens?

3333
01:35:46,570 --> 01:35:47,610
Darker on the pimps.

3334
01:35:47,611 --> 01:35:50,580
The famous one pimps up hoes
down and hookers at the point.

3335
01:35:50,720 --> 01:35:50,920
No,

3336
01:35:50,920 --> 01:35:51,061
no.

3337
01:35:51,061 --> 01:35:51,721
This is your other one?

3338
01:35:51,721 --> 01:35:52,920
The one that was in the movie theater.

3339
01:35:53,640 --> 01:35:54,001
Yeah.

3340
01:35:54,001 --> 01:35:54,960
What was the one that we were here?

3341
01:35:54,961 --> 01:35:56,040
It was John Singleton did.

3342
01:35:56,041 --> 01:35:57,930
It was like Fillmore slum.

3343
01:35:57,960 --> 01:35:58,410
Yeah.

3344
01:35:58,410 --> 01:35:59,550
Who the fuck was that one?

3345
01:36:00,120 --> 01:36:00,871
I don't remember,

3346
01:36:00,871 --> 01:36:01,600
but it was,

3347
01:36:01,600 --> 01:36:03,270
God damn it wasn't,

3348
01:36:03,271 --> 01:36:04,230
I don't remember it.

3349
01:36:04,540 --> 01:36:06,360
There's a famous pimp movie shit.

3350
01:36:07,050 --> 01:36:07,471
Yeah,

3351
01:36:07,471 --> 01:36:08,460
that was a good one too.

3352
01:36:08,710 --> 01:36:10,110
That might have been
even better than pimps.

3353
01:36:10,240 --> 01:36:15,240
They were called Pimp American Mexican
American Mexican American parents.

3354
01:36:15,740 --> 01:36:16,200
Yeah.

3355
01:36:16,200 --> 01:36:17,580
They're both really good man.

3356
01:36:17,610 --> 01:36:19,260
It's a weird world band.

3357
01:36:19,380 --> 01:36:21,590
And they have those
pimp conventions and Oh,

3358
01:36:21,650 --> 01:36:25,530
remember remembering pimps up hoes down
ice tea went to the pimp convention and

3359
01:36:25,531 --> 01:36:28,440
started telling everybody that he was a
pimp and he was like rapping and talking

3360
01:36:28,441 --> 01:36:29,580
about how he's not really a rapper.

3361
01:36:29,581 --> 01:36:30,414
He's just a pimp.

3362
01:36:30,810 --> 01:36:31,643
Yes.

3363
01:36:32,460 --> 01:36:33,293
Okay.

3364
01:36:33,990 --> 01:36:36,960
I thought you were on that
special victims unit show.

3365
01:36:36,961 --> 01:36:37,430
No,

3366
01:36:37,430 --> 01:36:37,671
no,

3367
01:36:37,671 --> 01:36:37,841
no,

3368
01:36:37,841 --> 01:36:38,070
no,

3369
01:36:38,070 --> 01:36:38,311
no,

3370
01:36:38,311 --> 01:36:38,611
no.

3371
01:36:38,611 --> 01:36:39,444
Never seen it.

3372
01:36:42,180 --> 01:36:43,013
Never seen it.

3373
01:36:43,440 --> 01:36:44,280
Just pimping.

3374
01:36:44,310 --> 01:36:45,240
You got confused.

3375
01:36:45,241 --> 01:36:47,520
Dog Ice tea.

3376
01:36:47,521 --> 01:36:48,480
Straight pimping.

3377
01:36:49,280 --> 01:36:51,300
He's getting his hair done in the show.

3378
01:36:51,450 --> 01:36:52,760
Talking about the pimp game.

3379
01:36:52,800 --> 01:36:54,300
Had the pimp cane with the pimp came,

3380
01:36:54,301 --> 01:36:55,410
taught him about rap.

3381
01:36:57,630 --> 01:36:58,463
Okay.

3382
01:36:58,530 --> 01:37:00,000
That's something that
white guy can't pull off.

3383
01:37:00,060 --> 01:37:01,050
Cv Four.

3384
01:37:01,410 --> 01:37:04,530
Imagine if a white guy did that and
then got on one of those special victims

3385
01:37:04,531 --> 01:37:05,364
unit shows

3386
01:37:06,740 --> 01:37:06,951
and then,

3387
01:37:06,951 --> 01:37:07,111
well,

3388
01:37:07,111 --> 01:37:08,670
you know the special
victim unit shows too.

3389
01:37:08,671 --> 01:37:09,600
They're all about rape,

3390
01:37:10,210 --> 01:37:10,521
you know,

3391
01:37:10,521 --> 01:37:13,230
so it feels like if he's
on that and he says,

3392
01:37:13,231 --> 01:37:17,610
he says he used to sell pussy and he
used to sell plus he's not a rape show.

3393
01:37:17,760 --> 01:37:17,881
Yeah.

3394
01:37:17,881 --> 01:37:19,410
That's kind of a conflict of interest.

3395
01:37:21,690 --> 01:37:23,130
That's just like the bankers,

3396
01:37:23,790 --> 01:37:26,310
the financial lists to the SEC hiring.

3397
01:37:26,460 --> 01:37:26,831
Yeah,

3398
01:37:26,831 --> 01:37:29,050
it's exactly professors.

3399
01:37:29,450 --> 01:37:30,750
It's basically the same thing.

3400
01:37:30,810 --> 01:37:31,230
That doesn't,

3401
01:37:31,230 --> 01:37:32,430
that doesn't make sense at all.

3402
01:37:33,120 --> 01:37:33,810
Nice to you.

3403
01:37:33,810 --> 01:37:35,910
Silly man ain't hurting nobody on,

3404
01:37:36,000 --> 01:37:38,760
on Special Investigations
Unit though as Vu.

3405
01:37:38,761 --> 01:37:39,870
Is that what is cost for you?

3406
01:37:39,871 --> 01:37:40,440
Is that what it is?

3407
01:37:40,440 --> 01:37:40,980
I don't know.

3408
01:37:40,980 --> 01:37:41,880
He's not hurting anybody,

3409
01:37:41,881 --> 01:37:42,750
so no,

3410
01:37:42,751 --> 01:37:43,370
he's not.

3411
01:37:43,370 --> 01:37:44,940
In fact keep them off the streets.

3412
01:37:44,941 --> 01:37:45,774
Right.

3413
01:37:46,270 --> 01:37:47,000
A lot of girls.

3414
01:37:47,000 --> 01:37:47,833
There he is.

3415
01:37:47,880 --> 01:37:48,713
Look at this.

3416
01:37:49,110 --> 01:37:51,480
He's not talking montage.

3417
01:37:51,570 --> 01:37:51,661
Oh,

3418
01:37:51,661 --> 01:37:53,800
there's gotta be one
that hasn't talking five.

3419
01:37:53,801 --> 01:37:54,930
The one cause he's got his hair's in.

3420
01:37:55,350 --> 01:37:56,183
It's pretty funny.

3421
01:37:56,760 --> 01:37:57,660
It's weird though.

3422
01:37:57,930 --> 01:37:58,350
It's,

3423
01:37:58,350 --> 01:37:58,860
but that's,

3424
01:37:58,860 --> 01:38:00,540
that's a weird aspect
of the black community.

3425
01:38:00,541 --> 01:38:01,980
It doesn't exist in the white community.

3426
01:38:02,250 --> 01:38:02,581
Like there,

3427
01:38:02,581 --> 01:38:03,690
there wouldn't be like a,

3428
01:38:03,691 --> 01:38:07,140
a bunch of white dudes sitting
around talking about the pimp game.

3429
01:38:07,141 --> 01:38:07,974
There's not enough of them.

3430
01:38:08,170 --> 01:38:09,340
You got Mr. White folks.

3431
01:38:09,341 --> 01:38:09,671
Dude,

3432
01:38:09,671 --> 01:38:10,150
it's one,

3433
01:38:10,150 --> 01:38:10,983
one guy.

3434
01:38:13,460 --> 01:38:14,840
I think you probably
have two things running,

3435
01:38:15,080 --> 01:38:15,913
right?

3436
01:38:17,450 --> 01:38:18,283
Um,

3437
01:38:18,410 --> 01:38:18,741
yeah,

3438
01:38:18,741 --> 01:38:19,540
I dunno.

3439
01:38:19,540 --> 01:38:20,373
It's just,

3440
01:38:20,510 --> 01:38:23,150
it's weird that that
was not that long ago,

3441
01:38:23,330 --> 01:38:23,931
but I think you'd,

3442
01:38:23,931 --> 01:38:27,500
you'd feel a lot more criticism if
you're going to put a movie out,

3443
01:38:27,920 --> 01:38:32,920
sort of a glorifying the life of
essentially a criminal who owned slaves.

3444
01:38:33,651 --> 01:38:34,340
Women.

3445
01:38:34,340 --> 01:38:35,173
Sure.

3446
01:38:35,210 --> 01:38:35,631
That wouldn't,

3447
01:38:35,631 --> 01:38:36,590
that wouldn't fly today,

3448
01:38:36,591 --> 01:38:37,424
I don't think.

3449
01:38:38,360 --> 01:38:42,160
I think people would really
complain because all the
pimps up hoes down came out

3450
01:38:42,161 --> 01:38:42,994
a long time

3451
01:38:43,620 --> 01:38:44,020
game.

3452
01:38:44,020 --> 01:38:44,391
It was like,

3453
01:38:44,391 --> 01:38:44,571
Yo,

3454
01:38:44,571 --> 01:38:45,680
you that action is doing this.

3455
01:38:45,860 --> 01:38:46,010
No,

3456
01:38:46,010 --> 01:38:46,581
my idols,

3457
01:38:46,581 --> 01:38:47,301
iceberg slim,

3458
01:38:47,301 --> 01:38:48,134
I'm naming

3459
01:38:50,960 --> 01:38:51,840
and have her do an eight.

3460
01:38:51,841 --> 01:38:55,040
Then I could sit in front of this white
man and break him down exact same way.

3461
01:38:55,041 --> 01:38:55,880
It ain't no difference.

3462
01:38:56,180 --> 01:38:56,691
You know what I'm saying?

3463
01:38:56,691 --> 01:38:57,650
Cause I don't want no puts.

3464
01:38:57,651 --> 01:38:58,970
I never want to put he on my bed,

3465
01:38:59,570 --> 01:39:00,350
you know what I'm saying?

3466
01:39:00,350 --> 01:39:00,831
So I'm like,

3467
01:39:00,831 --> 01:39:01,161
okay,

3468
01:39:01,161 --> 01:39:02,410
I'm up in the play this motherfucker.

3469
01:39:02,450 --> 01:39:04,970
I'm really fitting to see
how far I can take this shit.

3470
01:39:05,570 --> 01:39:06,403
And um,

3471
01:39:06,830 --> 01:39:08,610
I've been doing it ever
since I came to ask.

3472
01:39:08,790 --> 01:39:10,160
I really came act,

3473
01:39:10,430 --> 01:39:11,480
I ain't no rapper.

3474
01:39:11,810 --> 01:39:12,291
I got,

3475
01:39:12,291 --> 01:39:12,950
it's all,

3476
01:39:12,950 --> 01:39:13,671
it's all game.

3477
01:39:13,671 --> 01:39:14,420
Ain't nobody.

3478
01:39:14,420 --> 01:39:14,811
I'm this,

3479
01:39:14,811 --> 01:39:15,381
I'm this work.

3480
01:39:15,381 --> 01:39:16,214
And these Niggas when that,

3481
01:39:16,360 --> 01:39:18,080
and then the funny thing
is when I get out of here,

3482
01:39:18,081 --> 01:39:19,230
when I deal with different individually,

3483
01:39:19,320 --> 01:39:21,490
but you know you ain't there.

3484
01:39:21,510 --> 01:39:21,830
I'm like,

3485
01:39:21,830 --> 01:39:24,020
maybe it's not a problem.

3486
01:39:24,700 --> 01:39:25,640
That's not a problem.

3487
01:39:25,690 --> 01:39:26,540
I got a problem.

3488
01:39:26,541 --> 01:39:27,374
If I could,

3489
01:39:27,470 --> 01:39:30,980
I could still do it better now than ever.

3490
01:39:31,190 --> 01:39:31,431
I could.

3491
01:39:31,431 --> 01:39:33,650
Not 95% of any Niggas bitches.

3492
01:39:33,651 --> 01:39:34,730
I know I can do this shit.

3493
01:39:34,731 --> 01:39:35,451
It's not a problem,

3494
01:39:35,451 --> 01:39:36,020
man,

3495
01:39:36,020 --> 01:39:41,020
but it's like that was a new adventure
for me when he get over here and real

3496
01:39:41,361 --> 01:39:42,230
niggas can see it.

3497
01:39:42,231 --> 01:39:42,490
They said,

3498
01:39:42,490 --> 01:39:43,323
this Nigga

3499
01:39:44,800 --> 01:39:45,633
my mind,

3500
01:39:46,440 --> 01:39:49,110
I'm not high enough to
watch that real knowledge.

3501
01:39:49,111 --> 01:39:49,910
You're not ready for it?

3502
01:39:49,910 --> 01:39:50,850
I think so.

3503
01:39:51,390 --> 01:39:52,410
I need more Alpha brain.

3504
01:39:52,920 --> 01:39:54,360
I'm not quite ready for that level.

3505
01:39:55,470 --> 01:39:56,830
I had too much off from brain.

3506
01:39:57,950 --> 01:40:00,100
I'm into my cerebral cortex right now.

3507
01:40:00,270 --> 01:40:00,810
Yeah.

3508
01:40:00,810 --> 01:40:02,520
I don't even know how we
got on this whole pimps up

3509
01:40:04,300 --> 01:40:05,280
to the vortex.

3510
01:40:05,310 --> 01:40:07,320
Not as depressing as the
hookers and the point series.

3511
01:40:07,350 --> 01:40:10,410
That's the most depressing shit or
kill a season I showed you last time.

3512
01:40:10,490 --> 01:40:11,323
Yes.

3513
01:40:12,900 --> 01:40:13,733
Yes.

3514
01:40:13,800 --> 01:40:16,410
There's a lot of those
depressing prostitute videos.

3515
01:40:17,190 --> 01:40:18,420
That's some depressing shit.

3516
01:40:18,421 --> 01:40:19,410
Was hookers on the point?

3517
01:40:19,490 --> 01:40:21,730
The where all the cars drive by us?

3518
01:40:21,770 --> 01:40:22,603
It just falls to him.

3519
01:40:22,640 --> 01:40:22,851
Everything.

3520
01:40:22,851 --> 01:40:23,550
The Bronx.

3521
01:40:23,550 --> 01:40:23,941
Bronx.

3522
01:40:23,941 --> 01:40:24,120
Yeah.

3523
01:40:24,120 --> 01:40:24,421
Yeah.

3524
01:40:24,421 --> 01:40:26,600
This is apparently one
area that's just got point.

3525
01:40:26,790 --> 01:40:27,210
Yeah,

3526
01:40:27,210 --> 01:40:28,980
it's just got the worst case.

3527
01:40:29,220 --> 01:40:31,830
They have a great farmer's
market that's point.

3528
01:40:32,010 --> 01:40:32,850
Fantastic.

3529
01:40:32,851 --> 01:40:33,661
Farmer's market.

3530
01:40:33,661 --> 01:40:35,280
The produce is amazing out there.

3531
01:40:35,310 --> 01:40:38,940
And so did the hookers just come out at
night and the farmer's markets done and

3532
01:40:38,941 --> 01:40:41,060
then just the atmosphere
changes radically.

3533
01:40:41,070 --> 01:40:41,740
They sell fish,

3534
01:40:41,740 --> 01:40:43,640
then they sell fruit fish.

3535
01:40:43,830 --> 01:40:44,740
Then they sell fish.

3536
01:40:45,630 --> 01:40:46,680
Are they still doing that?

3537
01:40:46,681 --> 01:40:47,520
It's a fun Hunt's point.

3538
01:40:47,521 --> 01:40:48,870
Did they clean it up after that show?

3539
01:40:49,470 --> 01:40:50,470
Uh,

3540
01:40:50,640 --> 01:40:51,331
I'm not sure.

3541
01:40:51,331 --> 01:40:52,800
I just go for the farmer's market.

3542
01:40:52,960 --> 01:40:53,291
Yeah,

3543
01:40:53,291 --> 01:40:53,561
yeah,

3544
01:40:53,561 --> 01:40:54,040
yeah.

3545
01:40:54,040 --> 01:40:54,880
I understand.

3546
01:40:54,940 --> 01:40:55,391
But I mean,

3547
01:40:55,391 --> 01:40:56,560
when you're at the farmer's market,

3548
01:40:56,561 --> 01:40:58,290
do you see like a daytime vampire?

3549
01:40:58,310 --> 01:41:01,070
Stragglers are still a,

3550
01:41:01,110 --> 01:41:04,420
I've never seen him putting sunscreen
on venturing out of the cave.

3551
01:41:04,720 --> 01:41:07,330
We've been here with one of
the best chefs in the world.

3552
01:41:07,331 --> 01:41:09,220
We haven't talked about food once.

3553
01:41:09,490 --> 01:41:09,791
Oh No.

3554
01:41:09,791 --> 01:41:10,990
We talked about fake food.

3555
01:41:11,510 --> 01:41:11,951
We did.

3556
01:41:11,951 --> 01:41:12,720
That is true.

3557
01:41:12,720 --> 01:41:13,960
You're such an all around.

3558
01:41:13,961 --> 01:41:14,621
Cool Dude.

3559
01:41:14,621 --> 01:41:17,320
Nobody would imagine that you are
one of the best chefs in the world.

3560
01:41:17,530 --> 01:41:18,040
You like,

3561
01:41:18,040 --> 01:41:19,170
you think of a great chef,

3562
01:41:19,190 --> 01:41:21,520
you think of someone that's
like impossible to reach,

3563
01:41:21,760 --> 01:41:22,600
some strange,

3564
01:41:22,810 --> 01:41:24,340
very introspective artists,

3565
01:41:24,341 --> 01:41:25,031
creative type.

3566
01:41:25,031 --> 01:41:27,700
And I consider myself
just a very dope sandwich.

3567
01:41:27,701 --> 01:41:30,940
Artists like greatest
subway worker of all time.

3568
01:41:30,970 --> 01:41:32,140
What is this driving you crazy?

3569
01:41:32,141 --> 01:41:33,220
All this gluten free shit.

3570
01:41:33,880 --> 01:41:34,300
Again,

3571
01:41:34,300 --> 01:41:35,050
angry people.

3572
01:41:35,050 --> 01:41:36,700
I mean I'm allergic to a lot of stuff.

3573
01:41:36,701 --> 01:41:39,550
I actually did this test because I was
having trouble on the road and I was

3574
01:41:39,551 --> 01:41:42,040
having stomach issues and I
got food poisoning a few times.

3575
01:41:42,040 --> 01:41:42,821
So I did these tests.

3576
01:41:42,821 --> 01:41:44,170
I'm allergic to dairy,

3577
01:41:44,230 --> 01:41:44,770
beef,

3578
01:41:44,770 --> 01:41:45,603
lamb,

3579
01:41:45,760 --> 01:41:46,780
all kinds of things.

3580
01:41:48,220 --> 01:41:49,600
You're allergic to lamb.

3581
01:41:49,880 --> 01:41:50,713
So,

3582
01:41:51,340 --> 01:41:51,910
well what I,

3583
01:41:51,910 --> 01:41:55,620
I take supplements and then
I can have things like,

3584
01:41:55,660 --> 01:41:57,070
it's going to affect me regardless.

3585
01:41:57,071 --> 01:41:57,620
Like,

3586
01:41:57,620 --> 01:41:59,200
or what do you mean
make you make you fart?

3587
01:41:59,440 --> 01:42:00,251
I get diarrhea.

3588
01:42:00,251 --> 01:42:00,821
I fart.

3589
01:42:00,821 --> 01:42:02,620
I burped and like I kind of,

3590
01:42:02,621 --> 01:42:03,454
um,

3591
01:42:03,670 --> 01:42:04,960
I have other issues,

3592
01:42:04,961 --> 01:42:05,261
right?

3593
01:42:05,261 --> 01:42:06,460
Like man boobs,

3594
01:42:06,490 --> 01:42:07,120
right?

3595
01:42:07,120 --> 01:42:07,601
Sam,

3596
01:42:07,601 --> 01:42:09,760
the come from eating the wrong foods.

3597
01:42:09,790 --> 01:42:12,400
The allergies can affect you
in so many different ways.

3598
01:42:12,401 --> 01:42:14,710
But I'm like highly
sensitive to like beef,

3599
01:42:14,711 --> 01:42:15,460
lamb,

3600
01:42:15,460 --> 01:42:16,090
dairy,

3601
01:42:16,090 --> 01:42:16,540
eggs,

3602
01:42:16,540 --> 01:42:17,650
all these weird foods.

3603
01:42:18,040 --> 01:42:20,080
So I've been seeing
like this nutritionist,

3604
01:42:20,081 --> 01:42:21,910
I still eat it because I love to cook.

3605
01:42:21,911 --> 01:42:22,744
I love to eat it,

3606
01:42:22,900 --> 01:42:24,640
but it's just about managing it,

3607
01:42:25,000 --> 01:42:25,833
you know?

3608
01:42:26,110 --> 01:42:28,510
So what do they know
what's happening at rarely?

3609
01:42:28,511 --> 01:42:29,650
I can only have it like,

3610
01:42:29,880 --> 01:42:30,640
like beef or lamb.

3611
01:42:30,640 --> 01:42:31,780
I'll eat once a month now.

3612
01:42:31,860 --> 01:42:33,730
Do they know what the
cause of all this stuff is?

3613
01:42:33,731 --> 01:42:34,564
Is this something,

3614
01:42:35,770 --> 01:42:38,170
I'm imagining beef and lamb forever.

3615
01:42:38,171 --> 01:42:38,830
Forever.

3616
01:42:38,830 --> 01:42:39,400
Forever.

3617
01:42:39,400 --> 01:42:42,400
Did you feel ill affects of it and that's
why you went and get it checked out?

3618
01:42:42,430 --> 01:42:43,780
Did it progressively get worse?

3619
01:42:43,810 --> 01:42:47,080
I've always had like intestinal
issues and things like that.

3620
01:42:47,310 --> 01:42:48,820
It's not something that
progressively got worse.

3621
01:42:48,821 --> 01:42:50,050
It was something that was always a case.

3622
01:42:50,200 --> 01:42:51,670
It's something that's always the case.

3623
01:42:51,700 --> 01:42:52,181
And then,

3624
01:42:52,181 --> 01:42:53,014
um,

3625
01:42:53,030 --> 01:42:53,340
they,

3626
01:42:53,340 --> 01:42:55,810
they can't tell me because they
didn't test me before for it.

3627
01:42:56,020 --> 01:42:58,000
Like food allergies is
kind of a new thing.

3628
01:42:58,001 --> 01:43:00,160
Like not everybody's gotten
tested for food allergies.

3629
01:43:00,760 --> 01:43:02,290
That's something people got to check out.

3630
01:43:02,530 --> 01:43:05,230
But do you think it got worse
after you were became a chef?

3631
01:43:06,100 --> 01:43:06,491
I mean,

3632
01:43:06,491 --> 01:43:08,260
I definitely more weird shit,

3633
01:43:08,261 --> 01:43:08,440
man.

3634
01:43:08,440 --> 01:43:10,510
I definitely felt worse than my stomach.

3635
01:43:10,660 --> 01:43:10,931
I mean,

3636
01:43:10,931 --> 01:43:12,220
I was farting all over the place.

3637
01:43:12,220 --> 01:43:12,911
Like my friends.

3638
01:43:12,911 --> 01:43:14,950
Like you sound like a fucking machine gun.

3639
01:43:15,230 --> 01:43:16,450
It's just a walking farm.

3640
01:43:16,690 --> 01:43:19,300
That's crazy that you're
allergic to beef and lamb.

3641
01:43:20,230 --> 01:43:21,160
Weird things.

3642
01:43:21,220 --> 01:43:22,420
My eyes get irritated.

3643
01:43:22,421 --> 01:43:23,290
It's kind of crazy.

3644
01:43:23,860 --> 01:43:25,750
There's a such weird things to be a,

3645
01:43:25,870 --> 01:43:30,280
how is it to go around the world doing
a cooking show if you can't eat like the

3646
01:43:30,281 --> 01:43:31,060
two most?

3647
01:43:31,060 --> 01:43:31,211
Well,

3648
01:43:31,211 --> 01:43:31,551
he's still,

3649
01:43:31,551 --> 01:43:31,691
he,

3650
01:43:31,691 --> 01:43:34,600
I just eat it and I
take those supplements.

3651
01:43:34,710 --> 01:43:36,430
And what are the
settlements that help you?

3652
01:43:36,431 --> 01:43:37,900
Do you take the adjustive enzymes?

3653
01:43:37,930 --> 01:43:40,510
I take a og wash route.

3654
01:43:40,511 --> 01:43:41,770
There's something like hogwash route.

3655
01:43:41,771 --> 01:43:45,250
There's grape seed extract
and methyl assists probiotics.

3656
01:43:45,360 --> 01:43:45,970
Um,

3657
01:43:45,970 --> 01:43:49,390
and then the thing is when I'm not
doing the shows and I'm not researching

3658
01:43:49,391 --> 01:43:49,870
foods,

3659
01:43:49,870 --> 01:43:51,160
I keep it really clean.

3660
01:43:51,230 --> 01:43:51,650
Right.

3661
01:43:51,650 --> 01:43:55,240
So what does your diet consist of then
when you're saying you can eat greens?

3662
01:43:55,260 --> 01:43:56,130
I eat seafood.

3663
01:43:56,150 --> 01:43:57,320
I can eat pork and chicken.

3664
01:43:57,710 --> 01:43:58,920
So chickens too.

3665
01:43:59,350 --> 01:43:59,780
Hmm.

3666
01:43:59,780 --> 01:44:00,561
That's fascinating.

3667
01:44:00,561 --> 01:44:01,311
Lamb and beat.

3668
01:44:01,311 --> 01:44:02,180
What about venison,

3669
01:44:02,210 --> 01:44:02,571
elk,

3670
01:44:02,571 --> 01:44:03,530
things along those lines?

3671
01:44:03,590 --> 01:44:04,170
I'm not sure.

3672
01:44:04,170 --> 01:44:05,420
They didn't test me for that,

3673
01:44:05,630 --> 01:44:07,100
so I got to figure it out,

3674
01:44:07,101 --> 01:44:08,690
but no food allergies is real.

3675
01:44:08,890 --> 01:44:10,450
How did you become a chef?

3676
01:44:10,451 --> 01:44:11,560
If every time you eat

3677
01:44:12,040 --> 01:44:12,610
fucking,

3678
01:44:12,610 --> 01:44:13,750
you're starting up a storm.

3679
01:44:13,780 --> 01:44:14,020
Yeah,

3680
01:44:14,020 --> 01:44:16,030
I followed it up with so I
think it was just how it was.

3681
01:44:16,031 --> 01:44:17,530
A kid used to sign my yearbook,

3682
01:44:17,560 --> 01:44:18,393
this one kid,

3683
01:44:18,400 --> 01:44:20,740
because I had so much like sinus issues.

3684
01:44:21,070 --> 01:44:21,701
He was like,

3685
01:44:21,701 --> 01:44:24,040
and I farted all the time
and I always needed to poop.

3686
01:44:24,240 --> 01:44:24,641
He was like,

3687
01:44:24,641 --> 01:44:25,780
life is a highway,

3688
01:44:25,930 --> 01:44:26,890
bring tissues.

3689
01:44:27,920 --> 01:44:30,280
He signed my yearbook that
way in like sixth grade.

3690
01:44:30,790 --> 01:44:31,810
That's funny man.

3691
01:44:31,900 --> 01:44:34,600
What a weird circumstance to be found in.

3692
01:44:35,020 --> 01:44:38,740
Did they have any reason why they believe
that you got allergic to all these

3693
01:44:38,741 --> 01:44:38,951
things?

3694
01:44:38,951 --> 01:44:40,540
Like when they find out food allergies,

3695
01:44:40,541 --> 01:44:41,920
do they have a source for these?

3696
01:44:41,921 --> 01:44:42,850
Is it genetic?

3697
01:44:42,851 --> 01:44:44,200
Is it genetic?

3698
01:44:44,201 --> 01:44:45,760
I think for me it's genetic.

3699
01:44:45,790 --> 01:44:46,960
You're family has the same issues.

3700
01:44:46,990 --> 01:44:48,730
My mom has a lot of the same issues.

3701
01:44:49,060 --> 01:44:49,281
No.

3702
01:44:49,281 --> 01:44:52,510
I had also the weirdest thing
I had developed in Mongolia.

3703
01:44:52,960 --> 01:44:53,350
Right.

3704
01:44:53,350 --> 01:44:58,350
I got sick in Mongolia and I had to
take antibiotics to like flush my system

3705
01:44:59,351 --> 01:45:00,184
out.

3706
01:45:00,220 --> 01:45:04,210
I got back to America and went
to see this doctor and he's like,

3707
01:45:04,211 --> 01:45:04,780
dude,

3708
01:45:04,780 --> 01:45:06,190
you got a yeast infection.

3709
01:45:06,191 --> 01:45:06,401
I was like,

3710
01:45:06,401 --> 01:45:08,740
I thought I needed a vagina
to have a yeast infection.

3711
01:45:08,741 --> 01:45:08,981
He's like,

3712
01:45:08,981 --> 01:45:09,131
no,

3713
01:45:09,131 --> 01:45:12,570
you have a yeast infection in your
stomach and you cleaned it out.

3714
01:45:12,580 --> 01:45:17,580
Antibiotics and the bad bacteria got in
before the good bacteria can be the yes.

3715
01:45:17,860 --> 01:45:18,850
Yet you had it too.

3716
01:45:19,300 --> 01:45:20,133
No,

3717
01:45:21,390 --> 01:45:23,080
no but,

3718
01:45:23,160 --> 01:45:23,680
but,

3719
01:45:23,680 --> 01:45:24,101
but no,

3720
01:45:24,101 --> 01:45:25,210
I didn't have a yeast infection.

3721
01:45:25,840 --> 01:45:27,400
I think the deal is,

3722
01:45:27,410 --> 01:45:31,690
is like everyone has candida
because I have every symptom of it,

3723
01:45:31,691 --> 01:45:32,111
but it's like,

3724
01:45:32,111 --> 01:45:32,231
oh,

3725
01:45:32,231 --> 01:45:33,930
if you spit white and you fucking,

3726
01:45:34,570 --> 01:45:37,080
how about that fucking thing that you
were telling me about the last time we

3727
01:45:37,081 --> 01:45:37,471
talked,

3728
01:45:37,471 --> 01:45:39,200
that crazy bug that you had?

3729
01:45:39,490 --> 01:45:39,701
Well,

3730
01:45:39,701 --> 01:45:40,391
your stomach,

3731
01:45:40,391 --> 01:45:44,410
I was just going to say I've had all
this crazy shit cause you go basically if

3732
01:45:44,411 --> 01:45:46,900
you go like sub Saharan Africa,

3733
01:45:47,080 --> 01:45:47,411
you know,

3734
01:45:47,411 --> 01:45:48,580
Afghanistan,

3735
01:45:48,620 --> 01:45:50,470
lots of rural parts of India,

3736
01:45:50,740 --> 01:45:52,090
you're going to get some shit.

3737
01:45:52,600 --> 01:45:53,261
And so,

3738
01:45:53,261 --> 01:45:54,094
uh,

3739
01:45:54,250 --> 01:45:54,641
by the way,

3740
01:45:54,641 --> 01:45:57,280
I promised my wife I wouldn't
talk about my bowel movements.

3741
01:45:57,330 --> 01:45:57,671
Uh,

3742
01:45:57,671 --> 01:45:58,900
again on your show.

3743
01:45:58,930 --> 01:45:59,763
She has a problem with that.

3744
01:46:00,670 --> 01:46:01,011
But I,

3745
01:46:01,011 --> 01:46:01,271
yeah,

3746
01:46:01,271 --> 01:46:01,901
I had this,

3747
01:46:01,901 --> 01:46:03,760
a helmet headed,

3748
01:46:03,761 --> 01:46:08,140
a flesh eating parasite and my bowels.

3749
01:46:08,720 --> 01:46:09,190
Uh,

3750
01:46:09,190 --> 01:46:10,930
and I had to get it out and all this shit.

3751
01:46:11,260 --> 01:46:11,711
Anyway,

3752
01:46:11,711 --> 01:46:11,951
I,

3753
01:46:11,951 --> 01:46:12,820
if you ever go,

3754
01:46:12,821 --> 01:46:13,391
you look,

3755
01:46:13,391 --> 01:46:14,070
if you're not,

3756
01:46:14,070 --> 01:46:14,890
you know,

3757
01:46:14,890 --> 01:46:15,790
you go.

3758
01:46:15,791 --> 01:46:16,840
Then afterwards,

3759
01:46:16,841 --> 01:46:17,830
after you get the shit done,

3760
01:46:17,831 --> 01:46:18,131
you're like,

3761
01:46:18,131 --> 01:46:18,341
okay,

3762
01:46:18,341 --> 01:46:19,174
I'll have a,

3763
01:46:19,330 --> 01:46:20,830
I'll bring cereal bars and drinking,

3764
01:46:20,850 --> 01:46:21,760
bring my home water.

3765
01:46:21,761 --> 01:46:23,620
And like eventually,

3766
01:46:23,621 --> 01:46:24,130
like,

3767
01:46:24,130 --> 01:46:24,551
you know,

3768
01:46:24,551 --> 01:46:25,530
you're going to eat some,

3769
01:46:25,540 --> 01:46:26,470
you're going to drink something,

3770
01:46:26,471 --> 01:46:27,304
you're going to get some.

3771
01:46:27,490 --> 01:46:29,020
But what I just find amazing,

3772
01:46:29,021 --> 01:46:29,720
cause I,

3773
01:46:29,720 --> 01:46:31,220
I'm kind of a regular guy and whenever,

3774
01:46:31,221 --> 01:46:32,230
but you go to these places,

3775
01:46:32,260 --> 01:46:32,650
you're just,

3776
01:46:32,650 --> 01:46:34,390
you're going to pick up
a as it just happens.

3777
01:46:35,140 --> 01:46:36,730
But you know,

3778
01:46:36,790 --> 01:46:41,790
for a guy who has stomach
problems to become a traveling,

3779
01:46:42,491 --> 01:46:46,540
the world chef that makes Anthony
Bourdain looked like a fucking,

3780
01:46:46,570 --> 01:46:46,931
you know,

3781
01:46:46,931 --> 01:46:48,960
he's in short pants is a,

3782
01:46:48,990 --> 01:46:49,471
a very,

3783
01:46:49,471 --> 01:46:50,190
as is even

3784
01:46:50,190 --> 01:46:51,540
a more of a courageous choice.

3785
01:46:51,541 --> 01:46:53,610
Cause you're going to the
weirdest countries in the world,

3786
01:46:53,940 --> 01:46:57,240
eating the weirdest food in the world
when a cheeseburger will make you shit

3787
01:46:57,241 --> 01:46:57,870
your brains out.

3788
01:46:57,870 --> 01:46:58,051
Yeah.

3789
01:46:58,051 --> 01:46:58,321
No,

3790
01:46:58,321 --> 01:46:58,770
I,

3791
01:46:58,770 --> 01:46:59,850
I go crazy out there.

3792
01:46:59,851 --> 01:47:00,900
I bring a lot of,

3793
01:47:00,990 --> 01:47:04,890
I eat a lot of baroque and I eat a lot
of probiotics and I had just have to keep

3794
01:47:04,891 --> 01:47:05,371
it real.

3795
01:47:05,371 --> 01:47:05,790
Rocha,

3796
01:47:05,790 --> 01:47:06,391
the British,

3797
01:47:06,391 --> 01:47:07,560
my multivitamin.

3798
01:47:08,260 --> 01:47:09,480
That's a hangover cure.

3799
01:47:09,880 --> 01:47:10,080
Yeah.

3800
01:47:10,080 --> 01:47:11,450
I take it just on the regular from it.

3801
01:47:11,451 --> 01:47:11,851
What is it?

3802
01:47:11,851 --> 01:47:12,171
How does it,

3803
01:47:12,171 --> 01:47:12,690
how does it,

3804
01:47:12,690 --> 01:47:13,600
what does it Morocco,

3805
01:47:13,620 --> 01:47:14,453
I call it.

3806
01:47:14,760 --> 01:47:15,470
It's like,

3807
01:47:15,470 --> 01:47:15,770
it's,

3808
01:47:15,770 --> 01:47:17,280
it's better than an emergency.

3809
01:47:17,281 --> 01:47:17,581
All that,

3810
01:47:17,581 --> 01:47:19,290
it just be 12 vitamins.

3811
01:47:19,291 --> 01:47:20,130
It's like a rush of it,

3812
01:47:20,131 --> 01:47:21,360
but it really gets you,

3813
01:47:21,361 --> 01:47:23,040
it's an effervescent tablet.

3814
01:47:23,070 --> 01:47:25,320
That's like a super
hangover cure in England.

3815
01:47:25,380 --> 01:47:25,531
Oh,

3816
01:47:25,531 --> 01:47:25,831
I see.

3817
01:47:25,831 --> 01:47:30,831
So you dropped this in water and it's
like a lot of B 12 I used that a lot,

3818
01:47:31,710 --> 01:47:32,220
but um,

3819
01:47:32,220 --> 01:47:32,800
no man,

3820
01:47:32,800 --> 01:47:34,380
it's tough to do the show on the road,

3821
01:47:34,381 --> 01:47:35,940
but I love it cause I've,

3822
01:47:36,120 --> 01:47:37,410
I didn't know I was allergic.

3823
01:47:37,440 --> 01:47:40,050
I thought that that's just
how you feel after eating.

3824
01:47:40,260 --> 01:47:41,460
So 31 years.

3825
01:47:41,850 --> 01:47:43,770
I don't have a problem doing it,

3826
01:47:43,771 --> 01:47:44,551
but my doctor was like,

3827
01:47:44,551 --> 01:47:44,731
look,

3828
01:47:44,731 --> 01:47:45,530
if you want to live long,

3829
01:47:45,530 --> 01:47:49,470
you don't want to wake up everyday
with diarrhea and like Kinda like nasal

3830
01:47:49,471 --> 01:47:50,304
issue.

3831
01:47:50,340 --> 01:47:52,230
Then you need to change the way you eat.

3832
01:47:52,231 --> 01:47:53,110
So now I just,

3833
01:47:53,520 --> 01:47:55,740
you'll see in season two
I'm sneezing all the time,

3834
01:47:55,741 --> 01:47:56,520
everywhere.

3835
01:47:56,520 --> 01:47:57,271
How are your shifts?

3836
01:47:57,271 --> 01:47:57,991
No solid,

3837
01:47:57,991 --> 01:47:58,561
solid,

3838
01:47:58,561 --> 01:47:59,071
solid,

3839
01:47:59,071 --> 01:47:59,904
strong.

3840
01:48:04,260 --> 01:48:06,030
The thing either was that horse,

3841
01:48:06,110 --> 01:48:07,170
did you eat horse?

3842
01:48:07,250 --> 01:48:09,480
I I drank fermented horses.

3843
01:48:09,481 --> 01:48:13,470
Milk with the nastiest thing was
that's the alcoholic beverage.

3844
01:48:14,870 --> 01:48:17,950
Fermented Marysville ferments and
horses and milk might be another thing.

3845
01:48:19,470 --> 01:48:20,620
Fermented Mare's milk.

3846
01:48:21,750 --> 01:48:26,750
That's what the Mongols Seamus
and it clears your system out too.

3847
01:48:27,570 --> 01:48:28,860
It's like it detoxes you.

3848
01:48:28,861 --> 01:48:30,810
If it's your first time
drinking it really,

3849
01:48:30,811 --> 01:48:31,430
you don't clear you.

3850
01:48:31,430 --> 01:48:32,041
I want to go,

3851
01:48:32,041 --> 01:48:32,641
I want to do that.

3852
01:48:32,641 --> 01:48:33,610
How does it detox?

3853
01:48:33,611 --> 01:48:36,150
The tastes like shit or
that's what they tell you it,

3854
01:48:36,330 --> 01:48:37,560
it doesn't taste all right.

3855
01:48:37,770 --> 01:48:39,330
It sounds like it's going to taste bad,

3856
01:48:39,331 --> 01:48:40,170
but it doesn't taste bad.

3857
01:48:40,290 --> 01:48:41,123
It is.

3858
01:48:41,250 --> 01:48:45,420
It does feel like on clarifying shocker,

3859
01:48:45,540 --> 01:48:48,060
it feels like you're inside a horses ass.

3860
01:48:48,061 --> 01:48:49,200
But in a sweet way

3861
01:48:51,390 --> 01:48:53,110
cause it's like I can't picture,

3862
01:48:55,050 --> 01:48:59,340
you can't get around it that it's the
fermented essence of this animal and that

3863
01:48:59,370 --> 01:49:00,240
bothers you at first,

3864
01:49:00,241 --> 01:49:00,750
but then you're like,

3865
01:49:00,750 --> 01:49:01,980
it's kind of sweet.

3866
01:49:01,980 --> 01:49:04,620
It has a sweet and like delicate flavor.

3867
01:49:05,200 --> 01:49:06,300
It tastes like a horse.

3868
01:49:06,360 --> 01:49:07,630
It tastes like a fucking horse.

3869
01:49:07,850 --> 01:49:12,850
[inaudible] would sell if you brought it
back to the horse with rapt and honey.

3870
01:49:13,080 --> 01:49:14,670
That's what it looks like in that bottle.

3871
01:49:15,600 --> 01:49:16,920
The white bottle that's up there.

3872
01:49:17,040 --> 01:49:17,760
That's what it looked like.

3873
01:49:17,760 --> 01:49:18,221
Oh No,

3874
01:49:18,221 --> 01:49:18,431
no,

3875
01:49:18,431 --> 01:49:18,581
no,

3876
01:49:18,581 --> 01:49:18,721
no,

3877
01:49:18,721 --> 01:49:18,961
no.

3878
01:49:18,961 --> 01:49:20,910
Like a fermented Mare's milk.

3879
01:49:21,560 --> 01:49:22,393
Mare's milk.

3880
01:49:22,530 --> 01:49:26,270
Like they had it in a wooden bucket
and they'd just ladle it into bowls.

3881
01:49:26,290 --> 01:49:27,270
They just let it rot.

3882
01:49:28,080 --> 01:49:29,730
There was pieces of Hay in it.

3883
01:49:29,770 --> 01:49:30,101
All right,

3884
01:49:30,101 --> 01:49:34,290
because hey would just fly into it
and I was fucking with these people.

3885
01:49:34,350 --> 01:49:35,080
I want to drink.

3886
01:49:35,080 --> 01:49:38,100
That was actually good in a clean v out.

3887
01:49:38,190 --> 01:49:39,630
But she makes you shit.

3888
01:49:39,750 --> 01:49:40,583
I just shit my,

3889
01:49:40,620 --> 01:49:41,010
listen,

3890
01:49:41,010 --> 01:49:42,120
I didn't know if that's good.

3891
01:49:42,520 --> 01:49:43,860
Lamb chop makes you shit.

3892
01:49:44,580 --> 01:49:45,530
Well yeah.

3893
01:49:46,000 --> 01:49:47,950
Different in a different kind of shapes.

3894
01:49:48,510 --> 01:49:49,150
Porosity.

3895
01:49:49,150 --> 01:49:50,290
This was explosive.

3896
01:49:51,000 --> 01:49:51,500
This,

3897
01:49:51,500 --> 01:49:52,333
this rock me like

3898
01:49:53,910 --> 01:49:54,850
from the mayor's milk.

3899
01:49:55,050 --> 01:49:55,490
Yeah.

3900
01:49:55,490 --> 01:49:57,610
This shit just ran out of me like my ass.

3901
01:49:57,611 --> 01:49:58,870
Was Stan on south farm?

3902
01:49:59,040 --> 01:50:02,530
Do you think that this would be something
that could be successfully bottled and

3903
01:50:02,531 --> 01:50:03,910
then don't have a colon?

3904
01:50:04,030 --> 01:50:09,030
I'm sure people in Williamsburg and
Bushwick wheel by fermenting Williams,

3905
01:50:09,540 --> 01:50:10,750
the hip section of Brooklyn,

3906
01:50:10,751 --> 01:50:10,940
right.

3907
01:50:10,940 --> 01:50:12,760
Should bought vice should start bottling.

3908
01:50:13,290 --> 01:50:16,810
Know somebody came to us and said
we should make advice moonshine,

3909
01:50:16,811 --> 01:50:17,680
like a vice whiskey.

3910
01:50:17,681 --> 01:50:18,400
White whiskey.

3911
01:50:18,400 --> 01:50:19,121
That's a good idea.

3912
01:50:19,121 --> 01:50:19,954
You should do.

3913
01:50:20,350 --> 01:50:21,900
We should do a vice fucking marriage.

3914
01:50:23,830 --> 01:50:24,663
What's holding you back?

3915
01:50:24,940 --> 01:50:28,480
It's like if you like and
got cash to make it roll,

3916
01:50:28,481 --> 01:50:31,140
suddenly come boots it.

3917
01:50:31,150 --> 01:50:32,050
They will be shitting their,

3918
01:50:32,300 --> 01:50:35,950
this is all eddies fucking fermented.

3919
01:50:35,951 --> 01:50:37,570
Mare's milk St.

3920
01:50:37,570 --> 01:50:38,630
Let's make White Brooklyn Shit there.

3921
01:50:38,740 --> 01:50:41,140
I'm a big fan of Kombucha.

3922
01:50:41,170 --> 01:50:42,400
Do you drink Kombucha at all?

3923
01:50:42,640 --> 01:50:43,780
Talking about probiotics.

3924
01:50:43,800 --> 01:50:45,060
That's shit's great for you.

3925
01:50:45,400 --> 01:50:46,480
It won't get you lit up.

3926
01:50:46,770 --> 01:50:48,700
That mirror feel real bad.

3927
01:50:49,080 --> 01:50:50,410
I just drink terrible.

3928
01:50:51,010 --> 01:50:51,761
He's drank booze.

3929
01:50:51,761 --> 01:50:52,594
Heroine.

3930
01:50:52,780 --> 01:50:55,780
I think you go to places that are
so fucked up that you get back here.

3931
01:50:55,781 --> 01:50:56,051
You're like,

3932
01:50:56,051 --> 01:50:56,860
whatever.

3933
01:50:56,860 --> 01:50:56,981
No.

3934
01:50:56,981 --> 01:50:58,270
But I can I tell you one thing,

3935
01:50:58,300 --> 01:50:59,770
there's four blue zones

3936
01:50:59,840 --> 01:51:00,381
in the world.

3937
01:51:00,381 --> 01:51:04,190
You know what blue zone is like where
people live well into their hundreds and,

3938
01:51:04,250 --> 01:51:05,120
and a lot of them,

3939
01:51:05,930 --> 01:51:06,500
um,

3940
01:51:06,500 --> 01:51:07,910
Costa Rica where I write,

3941
01:51:08,020 --> 01:51:11,570
where I have a house where they just
drink a lot of booze and smoke a lot of

3942
01:51:11,571 --> 01:51:13,130
dope in Crete,

3943
01:51:13,280 --> 01:51:13,911
uh,

3944
01:51:13,911 --> 01:51:14,840
and Sardinia,

3945
01:51:14,841 --> 01:51:15,770
which is again,

3946
01:51:15,771 --> 01:51:16,330
just dude,

3947
01:51:16,330 --> 01:51:18,290
they just drinking wine all day.

3948
01:51:18,291 --> 01:51:19,520
Like they don't get wasted,

3949
01:51:19,521 --> 01:51:19,791
but you know,

3950
01:51:19,791 --> 01:51:21,050
they're drinking wine all day,

3951
01:51:21,350 --> 01:51:22,011
eating fish,

3952
01:51:22,011 --> 01:51:23,900
doing whatever while they eat everything.

3953
01:51:24,350 --> 01:51:25,340
And uh,

3954
01:51:25,490 --> 01:51:28,430
one IV in the caucuses near uh,

3955
01:51:28,490 --> 01:51:28,890
near,

3956
01:51:28,890 --> 01:51:29,723
um,

3957
01:51:30,800 --> 01:51:33,100
Dagestan were they walking up and
down the mountains and they eat,

3958
01:51:33,200 --> 01:51:34,070
they eat the same thing.

3959
01:51:34,080 --> 01:51:35,720
Are they lamb and vegetables and shit.

3960
01:51:36,320 --> 01:51:37,280
And then the,

3961
01:51:37,340 --> 01:51:39,290
the last one is this part of Japan,

3962
01:51:39,350 --> 01:51:39,681
you know,

3963
01:51:39,681 --> 01:51:40,110
where they,

3964
01:51:40,110 --> 01:51:42,620
they the like burdock
root every day and stuff.

3965
01:51:43,160 --> 01:51:43,993
But anyway,

3966
01:51:44,090 --> 01:51:44,780
uh,

3967
01:51:44,780 --> 01:51:45,980
they all drink booze,

3968
01:51:46,800 --> 01:51:47,581
they and,

3969
01:51:47,581 --> 01:51:49,430
and a lot of booze and the,

3970
01:51:49,431 --> 01:51:51,370
and the one thing is consistency of that.

3971
01:51:51,400 --> 01:51:53,540
They paid basically the
same thing every day.

3972
01:51:54,300 --> 01:51:54,600
Well,

3973
01:51:54,600 --> 01:51:55,620
you have a liver.

3974
01:51:55,710 --> 01:51:57,720
I mean liver can process booze.

3975
01:51:57,870 --> 01:51:59,610
It's just a matter of how
much booze you're drinking.

3976
01:51:59,780 --> 01:52:00,660
So that's what we're talking.

3977
01:52:03,600 --> 01:52:04,890
I seen some of those studies.

3978
01:52:04,900 --> 01:52:07,960
I figure it's the happiness
factor and the like.

3979
01:52:09,780 --> 01:52:10,150
I agree.

3980
01:52:10,150 --> 01:52:10,983
Yes.

3981
01:52:11,090 --> 01:52:11,280
Yeah.

3982
01:52:11,280 --> 01:52:15,390
I think that stress is probably the
killer way worse than almost anything else

3983
01:52:15,391 --> 01:52:15,730
you do.

3984
01:52:15,730 --> 01:52:16,450
Killer.

3985
01:52:16,450 --> 01:52:18,030
Especially like real stress like this.

3986
01:52:18,031 --> 01:52:19,080
People that can't go to bed at night,

3987
01:52:19,081 --> 01:52:21,480
they get home from work and they're
fucking a wire to the gills.

3988
01:52:21,780 --> 01:52:24,300
Thinking about the office and all the
things they have to get done and all the

3989
01:52:24,301 --> 01:52:26,400
competition and the social
politics that are playing on.

3990
01:52:26,690 --> 01:52:28,920
And then they sleep for a couple hours
and they get up and they're fucked up.

3991
01:52:28,921 --> 01:52:30,900
So they take a pill and then
they fucking keep going.

3992
01:52:30,901 --> 01:52:32,400
And two grandmothers,

3993
01:52:32,401 --> 01:52:32,840
one lift

3994
01:52:32,840 --> 01:52:35,550
to 99 one lived to 101 and the,

3995
01:52:35,640 --> 01:52:38,630
neither of them ever had
a job and the and the,

3996
01:52:38,670 --> 01:52:43,140
and at two o'clock in the afternoon it
was cocktail hour til it was 99 at night.

3997
01:52:44,070 --> 01:52:44,820
That was it.

3998
01:52:44,820 --> 01:52:46,100
They just got was that they got

3999
01:52:46,100 --> 01:52:47,930
lit up every well half like wow.

4000
01:52:47,931 --> 01:52:49,250
For four hours every day,

4001
01:52:49,280 --> 01:52:50,510
which they all worked up to.

4002
01:52:50,830 --> 01:52:51,320
That was,

4003
01:52:51,320 --> 01:52:51,770
that was it.

4004
01:52:51,770 --> 01:52:52,251
We just going to,

4005
01:52:52,251 --> 01:52:55,010
now we're going to have a heart cocktails
and then we're going to go to sleep

4006
01:52:55,011 --> 01:52:55,844
and that's it.

4007
01:52:56,060 --> 01:52:56,900
That's beautiful.

4008
01:52:56,901 --> 01:52:58,100
There's something beautiful in that.

4009
01:52:58,101 --> 01:53:00,460
When you really stop and
look at the actual end,

4010
01:53:00,590 --> 01:53:02,480
the city like what is the end?

4011
01:53:02,540 --> 01:53:03,630
What's the end game is the end.

4012
01:53:03,690 --> 01:53:04,330
I mean what do you,

4013
01:53:04,330 --> 01:53:04,910
what do you really,

4014
01:53:04,910 --> 01:53:05,091
well,

4015
01:53:05,091 --> 01:53:05,651
I want to do it.

4016
01:53:05,651 --> 01:53:07,370
You want to leave behind some structures?

4017
01:53:07,371 --> 01:53:08,190
What do you want to go?

4018
01:53:08,190 --> 01:53:11,540
You want to want to have some
things that are carved into stone.

4019
01:53:11,541 --> 01:53:12,470
What your name on it.

4020
01:53:12,560 --> 01:53:14,210
I'd like to build a monolith,

4021
01:53:15,350 --> 01:53:19,730
something very 2001 so something that
looks like it was placed here by the

4022
01:53:19,731 --> 01:53:20,564
aliens.

4023
01:53:20,810 --> 01:53:20,961
Yeah.

4024
01:53:20,961 --> 01:53:21,351
What do you,

4025
01:53:21,351 --> 01:53:22,310
what do you want to do man?

4026
01:53:22,311 --> 01:53:22,911
What do you want to go?

4027
01:53:22,911 --> 01:53:23,360
Me?

4028
01:53:23,360 --> 01:53:23,541
No.

4029
01:53:23,541 --> 01:53:25,190
Anybody in the world,

4030
01:53:26,150 --> 01:53:27,620
you might as well go their way.

4031
01:53:28,040 --> 01:53:31,490
Their way seems great to get together
with their little fucking country friends

4032
01:53:31,491 --> 01:53:35,540
at cocktail hour and start getting lit
up and talk his shit and talk about all

4033
01:53:35,541 --> 01:53:35,931
the dicks.

4034
01:53:35,931 --> 01:53:37,280
They suck back in the old days.

4035
01:53:37,820 --> 01:53:38,640
I bet they do.

4036
01:53:38,640 --> 01:53:40,610
That's my grandma every afford drinks in.

4037
01:53:40,650 --> 01:53:43,250
They started talking
about sucking cock crazy.

4038
01:53:44,690 --> 01:53:45,523
Maybe

4039
01:53:46,420 --> 01:53:46,910
I want it.

4040
01:53:46,910 --> 01:53:50,320
I want to hang out with grandma's getting
wasted talking about sucking tick.

4041
01:53:50,321 --> 01:53:51,154
They're out there.

4042
01:53:52,500 --> 01:53:53,010
Awesome.

4043
01:53:53,010 --> 01:53:53,380
Does it.

4044
01:53:53,380 --> 01:53:57,010
We say it will be awesome until they get
all fucking salivate and start looking

4045
01:53:57,011 --> 01:53:57,810
at your dances.

4046
01:53:57,810 --> 01:53:58,643
Weird.

4047
01:53:58,970 --> 01:53:59,803
That'd be weird.

4048
01:53:59,820 --> 01:54:02,270
That would be weird but awesome.

4049
01:54:03,290 --> 01:54:04,123
An old woman

4050
01:54:04,210 --> 01:54:07,050
used to be really hot and then you,

4051
01:54:07,051 --> 01:54:07,201
uh,

4052
01:54:07,201 --> 01:54:09,270
you see her now and you realize like,

4053
01:54:09,271 --> 01:54:10,080
Whoa,

4054
01:54:10,080 --> 01:54:11,040
like this is a strange,

4055
01:54:11,070 --> 01:54:12,900
like her body's deteriorated now.

4056
01:54:12,901 --> 01:54:16,480
She's just like little tiny
thing that can barely get by.

4057
01:54:16,640 --> 01:54:18,150
Her back's all hunched over.

4058
01:54:18,300 --> 01:54:19,500
They used to be this soft,

4059
01:54:19,501 --> 01:54:20,280
supple,

4060
01:54:20,280 --> 01:54:22,830
juicy sex pot.

4061
01:54:23,280 --> 01:54:23,850
You know,

4062
01:54:23,850 --> 01:54:24,720
that's a weird thing.

4063
01:54:24,750 --> 01:54:24,960
The,

4064
01:54:24,960 --> 01:54:26,250
the recognition.

4065
01:54:26,490 --> 01:54:28,590
The recognition of
mortality in that sense.

4066
01:54:28,690 --> 01:54:29,040
Yeah.

4067
01:54:29,040 --> 01:54:29,873
Sad.

4068
01:54:30,900 --> 01:54:31,081
Oh,

4069
01:54:31,081 --> 01:54:33,870
grandma's all young war stories.

4070
01:54:34,560 --> 01:54:35,640
You're talking about sucking Dick.

4071
01:54:35,660 --> 01:54:35,930
No.

4072
01:54:35,930 --> 01:54:36,763
Same War stories.

4073
01:54:36,830 --> 01:54:37,780
Old grandmas.

4074
01:54:38,620 --> 01:54:40,400
Well when you say war stories,

4075
01:54:40,410 --> 01:54:43,100
like what do you mean by wars and stories?

4076
01:54:43,780 --> 01:54:44,130
Yeah,

4077
01:54:44,130 --> 01:54:45,600
grandma's talking about that Shit,

4078
01:54:45,810 --> 01:54:46,051
man.

4079
01:54:46,051 --> 01:54:47,640
I hit all the dramatic angles.

4080
01:54:48,150 --> 01:54:48,983
Traumatic.

4081
01:54:49,360 --> 01:54:49,590
No,

4082
01:54:49,590 --> 01:54:52,320
I need to stop this podcast
and get a fucking notepad.

4083
01:54:52,860 --> 01:54:54,510
Dramatic angles.

4084
01:54:54,570 --> 01:54:56,380
What and exactly.

4085
01:54:57,360 --> 01:54:58,193
Okay.

4086
01:54:58,320 --> 01:54:58,980
Hmm.

4087
01:54:58,980 --> 01:54:59,910
I'm trying to think of my head.

4088
01:54:59,911 --> 01:55:00,760
I guess it would be like the,

4089
01:55:01,200 --> 01:55:02,550
the Pov Angle.

4090
01:55:02,700 --> 01:55:03,900
There's a side angle.

4091
01:55:04,260 --> 01:55:05,690
Tangle retain it.

4092
01:55:05,700 --> 01:55:07,560
How do you suck Dick or
looking at someone's taint?

4093
01:55:08,240 --> 01:55:08,591
No,

4094
01:55:08,591 --> 01:55:10,690
I'm saying she got to work this thing.

4095
01:55:10,710 --> 01:55:11,490
Grandma,

4096
01:55:11,490 --> 01:55:12,960
grandma got into the tank too.

4097
01:55:12,990 --> 01:55:16,050
They grew up in the fucking during
the days were soap as expensive.

4098
01:55:16,051 --> 01:55:18,480
They probably didn't work that
tank that they got up in there.

4099
01:55:18,630 --> 01:55:19,440
Do you think so?

4100
01:55:19,440 --> 01:55:21,210
I think during the depression
there wasn't a lot of taint.

4101
01:55:21,211 --> 01:55:25,080
Look and we need to get a round table
with these grandmothers and come to a

4102
01:55:25,081 --> 01:55:28,200
consensus on the
craigslist freaky grandmas.

4103
01:55:28,320 --> 01:55:29,430
You fucks with the taint.

4104
01:55:29,700 --> 01:55:30,031
Come on.

4105
01:55:30,031 --> 01:55:30,681
The Joe Rogan,

4106
01:55:30,681 --> 01:55:35,681
any real grandmothers of Orlando have
all these grandmas of Orlando that,

4107
01:55:35,941 --> 01:55:36,091
look,

4108
01:55:36,091 --> 01:55:39,930
we're sucking deck back in the fifties
tell us what we hear from them.

4109
01:55:40,140 --> 01:55:40,831
Tell us what was up.

4110
01:55:40,831 --> 01:55:43,410
Grandma's telling us a serious crack beer.

4111
01:55:43,440 --> 01:55:44,273
Wow.

4112
01:55:44,570 --> 01:55:48,690
Teach these young kids to
teach these young kids.

4113
01:55:49,760 --> 01:55:50,400
Um,

4114
01:55:50,400 --> 01:55:51,600
what are the disturbing shit?

4115
01:55:51,601 --> 01:55:52,291
Did you go see that?

4116
01:55:52,291 --> 01:55:53,580
You can freak us out about

4117
01:55:55,200 --> 01:55:56,250
Greenland melting.

4118
01:55:56,251 --> 01:55:57,990
And I'm training the Boston.

4119
01:55:59,110 --> 01:56:01,170
I don't know if we talked about it before.

4120
01:56:01,210 --> 01:56:02,610
It took us a while to shoot,

4121
01:56:02,611 --> 01:56:03,211
but I just,

4122
01:56:03,211 --> 01:56:03,540
uh,

4123
01:56:03,540 --> 01:56:08,540
we just finished it and it's
fucked up during the Cold War.

4124
01:56:08,940 --> 01:56:09,773
Um,

4125
01:56:10,920 --> 01:56:11,753
you know,

4126
01:56:12,600 --> 01:56:13,740
right after sort of,

4127
01:56:13,741 --> 01:56:13,921
you know,

4128
01:56:13,921 --> 01:56:14,400
the first,

4129
01:56:14,400 --> 01:56:17,000
the first bomb of 45 that
we started testing them and,

4130
01:56:17,001 --> 01:56:17,834
and you know,

4131
01:56:17,950 --> 01:56:18,691
what does it do?

4132
01:56:18,691 --> 01:56:19,524
And,

4133
01:56:19,740 --> 01:56:20,910
and so during the Cold War,

4134
01:56:20,911 --> 01:56:23,310
we had testing rounds in
Nevada and all this shit.

4135
01:56:23,850 --> 01:56:26,520
The Soviets were doing these air,

4136
01:56:26,700 --> 01:56:27,660
uh,

4137
01:56:28,380 --> 01:56:29,090
tests,

4138
01:56:29,090 --> 01:56:29,350
you know,

4139
01:56:29,350 --> 01:56:29,821
to test,

4140
01:56:29,821 --> 01:56:30,460
you know,

4141
01:56:30,460 --> 01:56:31,293
air bursts.

4142
01:56:31,620 --> 01:56:34,510
And they did it in a place
called the [inaudible],

4143
01:56:35,750 --> 01:56:36,360
uh,

4144
01:56:36,360 --> 01:56:37,650
testing polygon,

4145
01:56:38,370 --> 01:56:40,140
otherwise known as the polygon.

4146
01:56:40,560 --> 01:56:41,393
And in,

4147
01:56:41,790 --> 01:56:45,030
it was about an area that was
inhabited by about 2 million people.

4148
01:56:45,780 --> 01:56:48,990
And so what happened is the majority,

4149
01:56:49,020 --> 01:56:53,550
we went there and we checked out the
land and it was still a radiated.

4150
01:56:53,551 --> 01:56:54,660
Like 40 years later.

4151
01:56:54,990 --> 01:56:55,440
And it was,

4152
01:56:55,440 --> 01:56:59,490
I think the thing is like having five
cat scans and hour 24 hours a day for the

4153
01:56:59,491 --> 01:57:00,324
rest of your life.

4154
01:57:00,780 --> 01:57:01,890
So all of these,

4155
01:57:01,920 --> 01:57:05,820
all of these towns around the
polygon have these mutants,

4156
01:57:05,850 --> 01:57:06,683
right?

4157
01:57:06,930 --> 01:57:08,620
And like crazy mutants.

4158
01:57:08,640 --> 01:57:13,620
Like the scary thing about it actually
is they had a whole orphanage of mutants

4159
01:57:13,621 --> 01:57:15,930
that looked exactly like
the mutans from Akira.

4160
01:57:16,500 --> 01:57:18,570
Like maybe that's why they
do or care of that way,

4161
01:57:18,571 --> 01:57:21,780
but like it was literally like a
classic Comic Book Or Textbook,

4162
01:57:21,781 --> 01:57:23,640
like mutant and you're like,

4163
01:57:24,300 --> 01:57:25,710
it was scary because of that.

4164
01:57:25,711 --> 01:57:26,521
Like it wasn't like a,

4165
01:57:26,521 --> 01:57:27,210
you know,

4166
01:57:27,210 --> 01:57:29,310
it was a tumor here or whatever.

4167
01:57:29,520 --> 01:57:33,600
It was like these babies with these huge
heads with veins and them and shit and,

4168
01:57:33,601 --> 01:57:33,991
and,

4169
01:57:33,991 --> 01:57:35,310
and not just one like,

4170
01:57:35,370 --> 01:57:35,671
you know,

4171
01:57:35,671 --> 01:57:36,870
a whole orphanage full of them.

4172
01:57:37,050 --> 01:57:39,240
There was this one guy who had his whole,

4173
01:57:39,270 --> 01:57:39,690
uh,

4174
01:57:39,690 --> 01:57:40,110
sort of,

4175
01:57:40,110 --> 01:57:40,440
you know,

4176
01:57:40,440 --> 01:57:41,760
all of his skin was like,

4177
01:57:41,761 --> 01:57:45,580
sort of looked like it was melting
off was all tumors and you know,

4178
01:57:45,581 --> 01:57:46,980
that they have so many,

4179
01:57:48,140 --> 01:57:49,100
uh,

4180
01:57:49,170 --> 01:57:50,760
and this is three generations in.

4181
01:57:50,761 --> 01:57:51,241
So they're like,

4182
01:57:51,241 --> 01:57:51,820
okay,

4183
01:57:51,820 --> 01:57:52,690
what is this guy?

4184
01:57:53,030 --> 01:57:53,760
Not The guy.

4185
01:57:53,760 --> 01:57:54,530
That's one of the guys.

4186
01:57:54,530 --> 01:57:55,363
Yeah,

4187
01:57:55,620 --> 01:57:56,453
yeah.

4188
01:57:57,120 --> 01:57:58,050
That's sad man.

4189
01:57:58,080 --> 01:57:58,380
Yeah.

4190
01:57:58,380 --> 01:57:58,681
So,

4191
01:57:58,681 --> 01:57:58,890
so,

4192
01:57:58,890 --> 01:57:59,331
but anyways,

4193
01:57:59,331 --> 01:58:00,360
so what's happening now,

4194
01:58:00,361 --> 01:58:02,130
it's quite interesting
because it's the x men,

4195
01:58:02,131 --> 01:58:06,690
but in real life is what's happening
is the people from the Polygon,

4196
01:58:06,800 --> 01:58:10,350
I've gone into like other cities
and stuff and their human genetics,

4197
01:58:10,351 --> 01:58:12,060
like their genome has been,

4198
01:58:12,210 --> 01:58:12,990
you know,

4199
01:58:12,990 --> 01:58:15,780
re configured by the radiation poisoning,

4200
01:58:16,110 --> 01:58:18,900
but they're passing it on sort
of generation to generation.

4201
01:58:18,901 --> 01:58:22,740
So their kids and their kids' kids have
these same sort of genetic disorders,

4202
01:58:22,741 --> 01:58:23,760
rare birth defects,

4203
01:58:23,761 --> 01:58:24,211
cancers,

4204
01:58:24,211 --> 01:58:24,601
et Cetera,

4205
01:58:24,601 --> 01:58:25,434
et cetera.

4206
01:58:25,440 --> 01:58:29,370
And so what they've started to argue
for is that the issuance of a genetic

4207
01:58:29,371 --> 01:58:30,204
passport,

4208
01:58:30,630 --> 01:58:35,630
which registers your mutations and your
human genes in your genome and the,

4209
01:58:37,290 --> 01:58:37,531
well,

4210
01:58:37,531 --> 01:58:41,040
the obvious sort of extension of that
is why you fucking giving them a genetic

4211
01:58:41,650 --> 01:58:45,190
if you don't want them to
procreate because you don't
want them to procreate to

4212
01:58:45,191 --> 01:58:47,110
then pass on the mutated genome.

4213
01:58:47,530 --> 01:58:51,070
So it's this whole mute and
versus norm kind of x men,

4214
01:58:51,071 --> 01:58:52,120
but in real life.

4215
01:58:52,330 --> 01:58:52,781
And you go,

4216
01:58:52,781 --> 01:58:53,081
wow,

4217
01:58:53,081 --> 01:58:54,250
that's Nazi-ism,

4218
01:58:54,251 --> 01:58:55,450
that's fucking eugenics.

4219
01:58:55,451 --> 01:58:56,650
That's fuck you that can't be,

4220
01:58:56,860 --> 01:59:01,860
and then you go and see the genetics that
are been passed along and you're like,

4221
01:59:02,590 --> 01:59:02,861
oh,

4222
01:59:02,861 --> 01:59:04,540
this is some serious fucking shit.

4223
01:59:04,560 --> 01:59:04,790
We,

4224
01:59:04,790 --> 01:59:05,800
we did some.

4225
01:59:05,980 --> 01:59:06,551
And when I said,

4226
01:59:06,551 --> 01:59:07,930
we don't understand the technology,

4227
01:59:07,931 --> 01:59:09,550
obviously we don't
understand the power of it.

4228
01:59:09,790 --> 01:59:11,320
We don't understand how to store it.

4229
01:59:11,321 --> 01:59:14,110
We don't understand how to make
it without fucking melting down.

4230
01:59:14,110 --> 01:59:16,870
Fukushima's fucking
irradiating fish in la.

4231
01:59:16,871 --> 01:59:17,740
Like it's crazy.

4232
01:59:18,310 --> 01:59:22,510
But when you talk about genetics
and how genetics get affected,

4233
01:59:22,630 --> 01:59:24,730
you just get to the
fucking tip of the iceberg.

4234
01:59:24,731 --> 01:59:25,421
I want shit,

4235
01:59:25,421 --> 01:59:26,254
we're fucking up.

4236
01:59:26,380 --> 01:59:30,250
And so when you see these people who are
being issued by with genetic passports

4237
01:59:30,251 --> 01:59:31,084
to like you,

4238
01:59:31,210 --> 01:59:31,601
you know,

4239
01:59:31,601 --> 01:59:32,530
for procreation,

4240
01:59:32,531 --> 01:59:32,981
for all these things,

4241
01:59:32,981 --> 01:59:34,480
because their genome is fucked up.

4242
01:59:34,481 --> 01:59:34,751
You're like,

4243
01:59:34,751 --> 01:59:36,310
what the fuck we made that?

4244
01:59:36,311 --> 01:59:37,000
We did that.

4245
01:59:37,000 --> 01:59:39,550
We created this shit that
fucks up our genetics.

4246
01:59:39,580 --> 01:59:41,210
It's crazy how bad his Fukushima

4247
01:59:43,220 --> 01:59:44,053
very bad.

4248
01:59:44,760 --> 01:59:45,150
Like,

4249
01:59:45,150 --> 01:59:45,761
like what,

4250
01:59:45,761 --> 01:59:46,511
what it shows,

4251
01:59:46,511 --> 01:59:47,830
what's interesting about it is,

4252
01:59:47,831 --> 01:59:49,390
so when sandy hit New York,

4253
01:59:49,990 --> 01:59:50,341
you know,

4254
01:59:50,341 --> 01:59:50,560
uh,

4255
01:59:50,560 --> 01:59:53,200
there's the 14th street power plant that,

4256
01:59:53,350 --> 01:59:53,770
that,

4257
01:59:53,770 --> 01:59:54,270
that,

4258
01:59:54,270 --> 01:59:54,700
that,

4259
01:59:54,700 --> 01:59:55,900
that got knocked out.

4260
01:59:56,350 --> 01:59:57,190
And it was like,

4261
01:59:57,191 --> 02:00:00,100
we have an 18 foot Floodwall like 18 feet,

4262
02:00:00,101 --> 02:00:00,550
man,

4263
02:00:00,550 --> 02:00:02,220
but what if the water comes over it?

4264
02:00:02,290 --> 02:00:02,921
But it can.

4265
02:00:02,921 --> 02:00:03,754
It's 18 feet.

4266
02:00:03,830 --> 02:00:04,570
But what if it comes up?

4267
02:00:04,570 --> 02:00:04,811
Well,

4268
02:00:04,811 --> 02:00:06,220
it will short out and we'll be fucked him.

4269
02:00:06,221 --> 02:00:09,370
There'll be no energy in fucking New
York for that live on 14th street.

4270
02:00:09,500 --> 02:00:10,333
It happened

4271
02:00:14,500 --> 02:00:15,340
and the thing is,

4272
02:00:15,390 --> 02:00:16,330
and you sit there and you say,

4273
02:00:16,331 --> 02:00:17,110
okay,

4274
02:00:17,110 --> 02:00:20,260
but they're just incredulous because
it can never go over the flood wall.

4275
02:00:20,290 --> 02:00:21,980
And then of course it
did go to the flood wall,

4276
02:00:21,990 --> 02:00:22,481
blew up,

4277
02:00:22,481 --> 02:00:23,380
and then you'd fucking,

4278
02:00:23,410 --> 02:00:24,250
you have no power.

4279
02:00:24,880 --> 02:00:26,110
If you look at Fukushima,

4280
02:00:26,111 --> 02:00:31,111
it's a perfect example of the problem
with nuclear power is that okay,

4281
02:00:31,760 --> 02:00:33,970
it's no way the fucking
seat can come up here.

4282
02:00:33,971 --> 02:00:35,160
The sea can not come up.

4283
02:00:35,380 --> 02:00:36,460
It just can't get here.

4284
02:00:36,880 --> 02:00:37,713
Boom.

4285
02:00:37,780 --> 02:00:38,980
There's a fucking tsunami.

4286
02:00:39,100 --> 02:00:40,840
It comes up and it's fucking,

4287
02:00:40,870 --> 02:00:41,650
that's it.

4288
02:00:41,650 --> 02:00:42,130
Now the,

4289
02:00:42,130 --> 02:00:42,900
the,

4290
02:00:42,900 --> 02:00:47,260
the level of the levels of radiation
have not fucking gone and they're still

4291
02:00:47,261 --> 02:00:47,470
worth,

4292
02:00:47,470 --> 02:00:48,850
we have a crew there shooting right now.

4293
02:00:49,000 --> 02:00:51,910
The levels of radiation in the
area are through the fucking roof,

4294
02:00:52,180 --> 02:00:56,320
the levels of radiation now that go
out and sort of concentric circles.

4295
02:00:56,750 --> 02:00:58,300
I think there's been some reports.

4296
02:00:58,301 --> 02:00:58,891
Now again,

4297
02:00:58,891 --> 02:01:00,400
I haven't verified these reports.

4298
02:01:00,430 --> 02:01:02,560
I'm going to go on the record of you know,

4299
02:01:02,561 --> 02:01:03,150
fish,

4300
02:01:03,150 --> 02:01:04,370
you know here that are fully,

4301
02:01:04,371 --> 02:01:06,250
you were radiated from
Fukushima and you're like,

4302
02:01:06,251 --> 02:01:07,084
okay,

4303
02:01:07,700 --> 02:01:09,550
how much worse do we need it to be?

4304
02:01:09,850 --> 02:01:14,850
That's why you taking the spent fuel rods
and things becomes an issue because we

4305
02:01:14,861 --> 02:01:16,490
can't go forward with the,

4306
02:01:16,550 --> 02:01:16,841
the,

4307
02:01:16,841 --> 02:01:17,081
the,

4308
02:01:17,081 --> 02:01:17,621
the current,

4309
02:01:17,621 --> 02:01:19,000
the technology as it is.

4310
02:01:19,450 --> 02:01:22,720
And so that's why if you take the spent
fuel and at least can do something with

4311
02:01:22,721 --> 02:01:26,510
it rather than just let it fucking
irradiate for the next 10,000 and this has

4312
02:01:26,511 --> 02:01:27,191
all been proven,

4313
02:01:27,191 --> 02:01:28,024
this kid's theories,

4314
02:01:28,540 --> 02:01:29,980
you reusing splat fields?

4315
02:01:30,000 --> 02:01:30,833
Oh No,

4316
02:01:31,120 --> 02:01:31,511
not that.

4317
02:01:31,511 --> 02:01:31,940
I know.

4318
02:01:31,940 --> 02:01:32,621
Maybe they have,

4319
02:01:32,621 --> 02:01:33,100
I don't know.

4320
02:01:33,100 --> 02:01:34,660
I just saw a speech and I was,

4321
02:01:34,690 --> 02:01:35,021
you know,

4322
02:01:35,021 --> 02:01:36,250
I'd had a few drinks and I'm like,

4323
02:01:36,251 --> 02:01:37,084
I'm crying.

4324
02:01:37,810 --> 02:01:39,040
This guy is going to save my,

4325
02:01:40,010 --> 02:01:40,843
I love you.

4326
02:01:40,970 --> 02:01:42,640
17 year old boy with a bowl cut.

4327
02:01:43,010 --> 02:01:46,150
I did see a piece on the fish on a tune,

4328
02:01:46,151 --> 02:01:49,040
it's being 3% more
irradiated than ever before.

4329
02:01:49,860 --> 02:01:50,321
That's a,

4330
02:01:50,321 --> 02:01:51,230
that's a big number.

4331
02:01:51,560 --> 02:01:54,760
3% after a couple of years when you do
something that's going to be irradiating

4332
02:01:54,920 --> 02:01:57,770
the ocean for hundreds of thousands
of years if it keeps leaking.

4333
02:01:57,800 --> 02:01:58,310
Yeah.

4334
02:01:58,310 --> 02:01:58,491
I mean,

4335
02:01:58,491 --> 02:01:59,170
is it,

4336
02:01:59,170 --> 02:01:59,580
you know,

4337
02:01:59,580 --> 02:01:59,821
that,

4338
02:01:59,821 --> 02:02:02,900
that thing that they're doing to where
they're trying to make the structure to

4339
02:02:02,901 --> 02:02:05,180
keep all the water in
all the radiated water.

4340
02:02:05,210 --> 02:02:05,960
Yeah.

4341
02:02:05,960 --> 02:02:08,600
And they're going to keep it in with
ice wall so they didn't have to keep it

4342
02:02:08,601 --> 02:02:09,171
frozen.

4343
02:02:09,171 --> 02:02:12,980
And there's a lot of stories now
coming out to the Japanese government,

4344
02:02:13,010 --> 02:02:13,251
you know,

4345
02:02:13,251 --> 02:02:16,430
kept it under wraps and didn't
want to tell anybody in the food,

4346
02:02:16,450 --> 02:02:16,761
you know,

4347
02:02:16,761 --> 02:02:21,020
around in the whole region was a
radiated people in Tokyo we're showing,

4348
02:02:21,021 --> 02:02:21,500
you know,

4349
02:02:21,500 --> 02:02:23,270
in increased,

4350
02:02:23,271 --> 02:02:23,540
uh,

4351
02:02:23,540 --> 02:02:23,991
signs,

4352
02:02:23,991 --> 02:02:24,321
et Cetera,

4353
02:02:24,321 --> 02:02:25,040
et cetera.

4354
02:02:25,040 --> 02:02:25,701
And you're like,

4355
02:02:25,701 --> 02:02:26,360
well,

4356
02:02:26,360 --> 02:02:27,193
you know,

4357
02:02:27,950 --> 02:02:28,590
okay,

4358
02:02:28,590 --> 02:02:30,500
it's going to be bad for quite some time.

4359
02:02:30,980 --> 02:02:35,210
What do you expect him and how the
fuck are they ever going to stop it?

4360
02:02:35,240 --> 02:02:35,671
I mean it's,

4361
02:02:35,671 --> 02:02:35,881
it's,

4362
02:02:35,881 --> 02:02:38,270
it's the rest of the world
going to join in and help Japan.

4363
02:02:38,271 --> 02:02:39,800
Are they still leaving it up to Japan?

4364
02:02:40,050 --> 02:02:40,760
Like what's,

4365
02:02:40,760 --> 02:02:41,593
I think if you look,

4366
02:02:41,790 --> 02:02:43,370
but if you look at environmental things,

4367
02:02:43,371 --> 02:02:45,110
I mean now it's become such as this,

4368
02:02:45,111 --> 02:02:45,560
what is,

4369
02:02:45,560 --> 02:02:46,100
what's this?

4370
02:02:46,100 --> 02:02:46,251
Yeah.

4371
02:02:46,251 --> 02:02:47,240
That's not real though,

4372
02:02:47,480 --> 02:02:47,781
Jamie.

4373
02:02:47,781 --> 02:02:48,020
That's,

4374
02:02:48,020 --> 02:02:48,853
that's not,

4375
02:02:48,860 --> 02:02:49,100
uh,

4376
02:02:49,100 --> 02:02:49,601
that's the,

4377
02:02:49,601 --> 02:02:51,200
that's that's not what that represents.

4378
02:02:51,201 --> 02:02:53,000
Doesn't wrapper represent radiation?

4379
02:02:53,030 --> 02:02:56,210
A lot of people have
mistakenly posted that things.

4380
02:02:56,300 --> 02:02:57,230
I don't know what it is,

4381
02:02:57,231 --> 02:02:58,400
but it's not radiation.

4382
02:02:58,401 --> 02:02:59,690
I remember reading it.

4383
02:02:59,940 --> 02:03:03,390
They really haven't mapped how
much radiation is in there,

4384
02:03:03,440 --> 02:03:04,221
where it's going.

4385
02:03:04,221 --> 02:03:06,000
But one of the theories that I was,

4386
02:03:06,150 --> 02:03:07,160
I was listening to this,

4387
02:03:07,161 --> 02:03:11,030
a professor talk about the currents
and the tides and where it's all going.

4388
02:03:11,030 --> 02:03:12,230
That somehow or another,

4389
02:03:12,231 --> 02:03:13,640
it's gonna wind up around Baja,

4390
02:03:13,641 --> 02:03:15,200
California and Mexico.

4391
02:03:15,590 --> 02:03:16,040
Yes.

4392
02:03:16,040 --> 02:03:17,120
It's being pushed out there.

4393
02:03:17,150 --> 02:03:17,780
Yeah.

4394
02:03:17,780 --> 02:03:20,990
And then it's going to pull up there
because that's where everything from Japan

4395
02:03:20,991 --> 02:03:21,830
eventually go.

4396
02:03:21,831 --> 02:03:22,371
See what else?

4397
02:03:22,371 --> 02:03:24,260
This one area and pulls
up and you're like,

4398
02:03:24,261 --> 02:03:24,741
that spot,

4399
02:03:24,741 --> 02:03:25,610
it's going to be dead.

4400
02:03:25,700 --> 02:03:26,150
Really?

4401
02:03:26,150 --> 02:03:26,421
Yeah.

4402
02:03:26,421 --> 02:03:27,980
That's why it's going to kill everything.

4403
02:03:27,981 --> 02:03:31,610
And that's of course a spot that a lot
of people fish and a lot of people surf

4404
02:03:31,611 --> 02:03:36,611
and it's a very popular spot and it's
just going to be radioactive as fuck and

4405
02:03:37,461 --> 02:03:40,460
it's going to go through the Polynesian
islands before it gets there.

4406
02:03:40,461 --> 02:03:42,860
So pretty much everything
is going to get raped.

4407
02:03:43,050 --> 02:03:46,850
It's unbelievably incredible that they
never thought that it would be able to

4408
02:03:46,851 --> 02:03:47,720
get shut off,

4409
02:03:47,840 --> 02:03:50,110
that they just built
this crazy power plant,

4410
02:03:50,810 --> 02:03:52,280
the ability to cool it down.

4411
02:03:52,281 --> 02:03:55,400
And that's what I'm saying is like we
have these fail safe methods because

4412
02:03:55,401 --> 02:03:55,701
you're like,

4413
02:03:55,701 --> 02:03:56,510
well it can't.

4414
02:03:56,510 --> 02:03:56,900
Right.

4415
02:03:56,900 --> 02:03:57,680
Go above this.

4416
02:03:57,680 --> 02:03:59,570
And then it does because we,

4417
02:03:59,600 --> 02:03:59,961
you know,

4418
02:03:59,961 --> 02:04:01,760
now whether it's become fucking crazy.

4419
02:04:02,000 --> 02:04:03,110
Well it's also we,

4420
02:04:03,170 --> 02:04:03,951
first of all,

4421
02:04:03,951 --> 02:04:04,680
even if we,

4422
02:04:04,680 --> 02:04:06,530
whether wasn't becoming crazy,

4423
02:04:06,800 --> 02:04:09,050
those kinds of storms have
existed throughout history.

4424
02:04:09,260 --> 02:04:13,820
It's incredibly arrogant and silly to
assume that those storms won't exist

4425
02:04:13,821 --> 02:04:17,150
during the brief window of time that you
haven't figured out how to shut these

4426
02:04:17,151 --> 02:04:20,360
plants down without it and you prepare
for it because the one time it happens,

4427
02:04:20,361 --> 02:04:20,900
it's worth.

4428
02:04:20,900 --> 02:04:24,890
And also we've had
earthquakes forever to like,

4429
02:04:24,920 --> 02:04:26,300
oh well here's a plant,

4430
02:04:26,690 --> 02:04:28,280
but if we have an earthquake,

4431
02:04:28,330 --> 02:04:28,760
we're fine.

4432
02:04:28,760 --> 02:04:30,050
Well you're going to have an earthquake.

4433
02:04:30,220 --> 02:04:32,990
Well they were good up until like a
seven or something crazy like that.

4434
02:04:33,740 --> 02:04:35,840
They couldn't handle
that 8.9 that rocked him.

4435
02:04:36,200 --> 02:04:38,010
Did you see that recent that was released

4436
02:04:38,010 --> 02:04:38,491
of the,

4437
02:04:38,491 --> 02:04:38,860
um,

4438
02:04:38,860 --> 02:04:40,200
this closed circuit camera,

4439
02:04:40,470 --> 02:04:41,460
the tsunami coming.

4440
02:04:41,461 --> 02:04:42,900
There's a car coming in.

4441
02:04:42,901 --> 02:04:46,230
The car sees a tsunami and turns around
and leaves and you see the tsunami

4442
02:04:46,231 --> 02:04:47,910
literally chasing the car down the street.

4443
02:04:48,420 --> 02:04:49,490
It's so fucked.

4444
02:04:49,650 --> 02:04:53,730
Cause when you talk about like the
water got to this guy's wheels before he

4445
02:04:53,731 --> 02:04:54,630
peeled out of there.

4446
02:04:54,631 --> 02:04:59,490
And then you see the waves with caring
van houses behind him carrying houses.

4447
02:04:59,670 --> 02:05:01,950
And this guy's P and
who knows if he made it.

4448
02:05:02,070 --> 02:05:05,370
I mean it would have been a cruel trick
if were all applauding his escape.

4449
02:05:05,371 --> 02:05:07,200
And then he runs into
a fucking traffic jam,

4450
02:05:07,500 --> 02:05:09,510
a block away and gets
run over with a house.

4451
02:05:09,810 --> 02:05:10,261
But when you,

4452
02:05:10,261 --> 02:05:10,951
when you watch it,

4453
02:05:10,951 --> 02:05:11,820
it's pretty dark.

4454
02:05:12,330 --> 02:05:12,691
It's like,

4455
02:05:12,691 --> 02:05:13,261
Whoa,

4456
02:05:13,261 --> 02:05:13,591
that,

4457
02:05:13,591 --> 02:05:16,830
that shit came in quick caring houses.

4458
02:05:17,570 --> 02:05:18,403
Damn.

4459
02:05:18,450 --> 02:05:19,200
Yeah.

4460
02:05:19,200 --> 02:05:20,280
And that could happen here.

4461
02:05:21,790 --> 02:05:22,270
Well,

4462
02:05:22,270 --> 02:05:23,103
it's a fault.

4463
02:05:23,310 --> 02:05:23,551
Well,

4464
02:05:23,551 --> 02:05:25,020
it's not just a fault.

4465
02:05:25,170 --> 02:05:26,480
There's assholes that have,

4466
02:05:26,500 --> 02:05:27,060
look at this.

4467
02:05:27,060 --> 02:05:27,893
This is a,

4468
02:05:27,960 --> 02:05:29,130
this isn't the video,

4469
02:05:29,131 --> 02:05:33,030
but this is one video of how
quick it overcomes everything.

4470
02:05:33,090 --> 02:05:33,923
Look at that.

4471
02:05:34,560 --> 02:05:35,580
A dry city.

4472
02:05:35,581 --> 02:05:37,890
And then all of a sudden out of nowhere,

4473
02:05:38,400 --> 02:05:39,810
here comes,

4474
02:05:39,811 --> 02:05:40,411
oh shit.

4475
02:05:40,411 --> 02:05:41,610
You better turn around bitches.

4476
02:05:41,611 --> 02:05:42,444
Look at this.

4477
02:05:42,690 --> 02:05:43,800
Whew.

4478
02:05:44,470 --> 02:05:45,303
Oh,

4479
02:05:45,540 --> 02:05:46,373
look at this job.

4480
02:05:48,060 --> 02:05:48,893
This guy,

4481
02:05:50,840 --> 02:05:52,580
oh my God,

4482
02:05:52,610 --> 02:05:52,910
look at,

4483
02:05:52,910 --> 02:05:54,590
but it's coming in with houses.

4484
02:05:54,650 --> 02:05:55,240
Yeah.

4485
02:05:55,240 --> 02:05:59,050
Not One house houses like
hundreds of houses in Wood.

4486
02:05:59,940 --> 02:06:02,380
It's just fucking insane.

4487
02:06:03,700 --> 02:06:04,200
Okay.

4488
02:06:04,200 --> 02:06:06,060
And it's happened here.

4489
02:06:06,090 --> 02:06:07,440
It's happened here throughout history.

4490
02:06:07,441 --> 02:06:09,450
There was a big one apparently somewhere,

4491
02:06:09,810 --> 02:06:12,330
I think they said it was the 17 hundreds,

4492
02:06:12,610 --> 02:06:12,841
uh,

4493
02:06:12,841 --> 02:06:15,300
in Portland somewhere
allow around Portland.

4494
02:06:15,301 --> 02:06:16,290
They just wiped out.

4495
02:06:16,350 --> 02:06:20,420
Most of the Pacific northwest just came
in a couple of hundred miles and it

4496
02:06:20,430 --> 02:06:22,780
fucking killed everything
and pulled out and every,

4497
02:06:22,850 --> 02:06:23,571
and you know,

4498
02:06:23,571 --> 02:06:24,930
a couple hundred years later,

4499
02:06:24,931 --> 02:06:26,850
trees grow back and everything looks nice.

4500
02:06:27,350 --> 02:06:28,080
No,

4501
02:06:28,080 --> 02:06:29,730
it's fine if that happens.

4502
02:06:29,790 --> 02:06:31,830
If there's not a reactor there,

4503
02:06:31,860 --> 02:06:32,910
if there's a reactor there,

4504
02:06:32,911 --> 02:06:36,840
it's pulling out all that
radioactive material forever.

4505
02:06:38,050 --> 02:06:38,800
Yeah,

4506
02:06:38,800 --> 02:06:39,310
yeah,

4507
02:06:39,310 --> 02:06:40,000
yeah.

4508
02:06:40,000 --> 02:06:40,721
Well you mean,

4509
02:06:40,721 --> 02:06:41,170
yeah,

4510
02:06:41,170 --> 02:06:41,680
you're right.

4511
02:06:41,680 --> 02:06:44,530
I mean that's the scariest thing is when
it's happening somewhere near reactor.

4512
02:06:44,770 --> 02:06:47,050
What really scared me is that I don't,

4513
02:06:47,430 --> 02:06:51,490
I don't think I've heard one person come
up with any way that makes sense as to

4514
02:06:51,491 --> 02:06:52,324
how to contain it.

4515
02:06:52,960 --> 02:06:54,340
Not just how to contain it,

4516
02:06:54,341 --> 02:06:55,330
but how to stop it.

4517
02:06:55,331 --> 02:06:58,960
How to clean the area up is
almost just not even discussed.

4518
02:06:58,990 --> 02:06:59,770
Right.

4519
02:06:59,770 --> 02:07:00,970
I mean how the fuck do they clean that?

4520
02:07:01,480 --> 02:07:01,901
How do you put,

4521
02:07:01,901 --> 02:07:03,730
you're going to put a
giant filter on the ocean.

4522
02:07:03,731 --> 02:07:06,550
I'm guessing they can't and that's
why they don't talk about it,

4523
02:07:06,610 --> 02:07:08,320
but that's no reason either.

4524
02:07:08,530 --> 02:07:11,380
It's not going to fuck up the entire west
coast cause that's like the worst case

4525
02:07:11,381 --> 02:07:14,890
doomsday scenarios that I've read online
that entire west coast for sure out

4526
02:07:14,891 --> 02:07:18,190
there with the radiation moving
to California at that shit is,

4527
02:07:18,310 --> 02:07:19,690
that map is scary.

4528
02:07:20,260 --> 02:07:23,220
Let's what I said that map doesn't
necessarily represent radiation.

4529
02:07:23,390 --> 02:07:23,800
Yeah.

4530
02:07:23,800 --> 02:07:24,110
Well,

4531
02:07:24,110 --> 02:07:25,660
let me say radiation map,

4532
02:07:25,661 --> 02:07:26,650
Japan debunked.

4533
02:07:26,651 --> 02:07:27,640
I'll pull it up because,

4534
02:07:29,030 --> 02:07:29,550
okay.

4535
02:07:29,550 --> 02:07:32,480
You kinda are good at sort of
putting some up and then debunking

4536
02:07:32,480 --> 02:07:32,820
it.

4537
02:07:32,820 --> 02:07:33,471
That's what it is.

4538
02:07:33,471 --> 02:07:34,400
I'm mysterious,

4539
02:07:34,401 --> 02:07:35,150
Bro.

4540
02:07:35,150 --> 02:07:36,250
I move around.

4541
02:07:36,280 --> 02:07:36,491
Yeah.

4542
02:07:36,491 --> 02:07:39,820
Debunking the NC a radiation map.

4543
02:07:40,270 --> 02:07:40,690
Yeah.

4544
02:07:40,690 --> 02:07:43,960
More Fukushima skier
scaremongering debunked.

4545
02:07:44,590 --> 02:07:45,040
Yes.

4546
02:07:45,040 --> 02:07:45,660
Apparently

4547
02:07:45,660 --> 02:07:45,871
not.

4548
02:07:45,871 --> 02:07:45,961
What,

4549
02:07:45,961 --> 02:07:48,180
how do you know that the
debunking isn't the moment?

4550
02:07:48,310 --> 02:07:49,460
Tell them to him,

4551
02:07:51,100 --> 02:07:51,370
dude,

4552
02:07:51,370 --> 02:07:52,930
you're scaring the fuck out of me now.

4553
02:07:53,010 --> 02:07:53,843
I don't even know.

4554
02:07:54,700 --> 02:07:55,533
Um,

4555
02:07:56,570 --> 02:07:57,080
no,

4556
02:07:57,080 --> 02:07:57,480
no,

4557
02:07:57,480 --> 02:07:58,060
no,

4558
02:07:58,060 --> 02:07:58,320
no,

4559
02:07:58,320 --> 02:07:58,591
no,

4560
02:07:58,591 --> 02:07:58,891
no,

4561
02:07:58,891 --> 02:07:59,200
no,

4562
02:07:59,200 --> 02:07:59,680
no.

4563
02:07:59,680 --> 02:08:01,030
Uh,

4564
02:08:01,120 --> 02:08:01,953
yeah.

4565
02:08:02,800 --> 02:08:04,000
Apparently it's been debunked.

4566
02:08:04,660 --> 02:08:07,300
A couple of different websites
that seems to make sense.

4567
02:08:07,990 --> 02:08:08,650
Snopes,

4568
02:08:08,650 --> 02:08:09,760
Snopes debunked it.

4569
02:08:09,820 --> 02:08:14,650
Image purportedly shows radioactive
sewage spreading across the Pacific Ocean

4570
02:08:14,651 --> 02:08:15,790
and is false.

4571
02:08:16,450 --> 02:08:17,650
That's not what it is.

4572
02:08:18,850 --> 02:08:22,690
But how do you know that the
person is saying that isn't true?

4573
02:08:23,380 --> 02:08:23,711
It's true.

4574
02:08:23,711 --> 02:08:25,570
If you want to be all
crazy doom and gloom,

4575
02:08:25,780 --> 02:08:26,350
but me,

4576
02:08:26,350 --> 02:08:27,460
I want to live my life.

4577
02:08:28,020 --> 02:08:28,280
Um,

4578
02:08:28,280 --> 02:08:33,080
so we've really vacillated tonight
between doom and gloom and fuck it.

4579
02:08:33,180 --> 02:08:33,810
It's all right.

4580
02:08:33,810 --> 02:08:34,740
It's going to be okay.

4581
02:08:35,220 --> 02:08:36,600
Then I'm like,

4582
02:08:36,601 --> 02:08:37,434
you know what?

4583
02:08:37,440 --> 02:08:41,910
It is going to be okay in here know sort
of Meth head guy with the radioactive

4584
02:08:41,911 --> 02:08:42,744
isotopes.

4585
02:08:43,090 --> 02:08:47,470
Someone who is an immigrant in America
I would think you would respect are fine

4586
02:08:47,471 --> 02:08:48,880
country enough to that.

4587
02:08:48,881 --> 02:08:50,440
You would look on the
bright side of things.

4588
02:08:50,680 --> 02:08:52,030
The glass is half full.

4589
02:08:52,031 --> 02:08:55,810
Shane Smith of vice.com
captain doom and gloom.

4590
02:08:56,340 --> 02:08:58,690
So you pay your mortgage
on doom and gloom.

4591
02:08:58,780 --> 02:08:59,770
How dare you.

4592
02:09:00,640 --> 02:09:01,960
And my fine country,

4593
02:09:01,990 --> 02:09:03,280
I smile in my show.

4594
02:09:03,670 --> 02:09:04,570
If the shit hits the fan,

4595
02:09:04,571 --> 02:09:05,800
you're going to move to Montreal?

4596
02:09:06,720 --> 02:09:08,020
No it gets warmer.

4597
02:09:09,010 --> 02:09:09,880
Nice up there.

4598
02:09:10,800 --> 02:09:12,270
But Canadian Shield,

4599
02:09:12,271 --> 02:09:13,740
you know get up there and the lakes,

4600
02:09:13,760 --> 02:09:15,390
millions of lakes can't get to me.

4601
02:09:15,391 --> 02:09:16,650
Can't get to me moving fast.

4602
02:09:17,670 --> 02:09:18,820
Is that well you don't have to worry about

4603
02:09:18,870 --> 02:09:19,201
people.

4604
02:09:19,201 --> 02:09:20,730
What I'm saying the shit hits the fan.

4605
02:09:20,731 --> 02:09:25,010
I'm saying when you have to like build
a house out of logs and go trapping from

4606
02:09:25,050 --> 02:09:27,350
beavers for dinner and
it's Canadian shoe man.

4607
02:09:27,780 --> 02:09:30,100
It's a good spot up there
plus of global warming.

4608
02:09:30,180 --> 02:09:33,660
We get to those going to be like the
road for like a thousand miles just with

4609
02:09:33,661 --> 02:09:34,860
your shopping cart dog.

4610
02:09:34,861 --> 02:09:35,694
Shit and shit.

4611
02:09:35,700 --> 02:09:36,850
Dog sled dogs.

4612
02:09:37,130 --> 02:09:37,420
Yeah.

4613
02:09:37,420 --> 02:09:38,490
You need a dog sled

4614
02:09:40,530 --> 02:09:41,363
dogs.

4615
02:09:41,550 --> 02:09:41,761
No,

4616
02:09:41,761 --> 02:09:45,060
that's why I'm enjoying the shit out
of my shit because God knows how much

4617
02:09:45,061 --> 02:09:45,691
longer we got.

4618
02:09:45,691 --> 02:09:46,524
So enjoy it.

4619
02:09:46,920 --> 02:09:49,250
You have an extra potent doom and gloom,

4620
02:09:49,400 --> 02:09:49,720
uh,

4621
02:09:49,720 --> 02:09:51,410
ideology in your head or,

4622
02:09:51,411 --> 02:09:54,490
or vision in your head rather because
you're doing so much traveling.

4623
02:09:54,510 --> 02:09:55,700
So many fucked up spots.

4624
02:09:55,970 --> 02:09:58,460
Like if you were just traveling
to the United States and Canada,

4625
02:09:58,710 --> 02:10:01,190
you might be like a lot of folks that
are out there that are just like,

4626
02:10:01,200 --> 02:10:01,550
yeah,

4627
02:10:01,550 --> 02:10:02,390
everything's gonna be fine.

4628
02:10:03,060 --> 02:10:03,893
Yeah.

4629
02:10:04,560 --> 02:10:06,830
We were talking earlier about the,

4630
02:10:07,150 --> 02:10:09,730
the 34,000 foot sort of uh,

4631
02:10:10,110 --> 02:10:10,770
how uh,

4632
02:10:10,770 --> 02:10:11,880
how it changes your shit.

4633
02:10:11,940 --> 02:10:13,620
Like you can become more
emotional or whatever.

4634
02:10:14,130 --> 02:10:15,970
It was interesting will explain
that for the people didn't,

4635
02:10:15,990 --> 02:10:18,630
weren't listening at like high altitude,

4636
02:10:18,631 --> 02:10:19,440
long haul.

4637
02:10:19,440 --> 02:10:20,840
You get this lights.

4638
02:10:20,850 --> 02:10:21,180
Yeah.

4639
02:10:21,180 --> 02:10:22,710
Like 34,000 pieces of cruising,

4640
02:10:22,800 --> 02:10:24,960
flight of general commercial aviation.

4641
02:10:25,530 --> 02:10:30,240
And so there's a syndrome where
you feel emotions much stronger.

4642
02:10:30,241 --> 02:10:32,700
So if you're like watching
a movie for example,

4643
02:10:32,701 --> 02:10:34,030
and I was to that on

4644
02:10:34,170 --> 02:10:35,540
the movie Armageddon,

4645
02:10:35,541 --> 02:10:37,020
I was like bawling my eyes out.

4646
02:10:37,670 --> 02:10:38,061
You just,

4647
02:10:38,061 --> 02:10:39,680
you have this uncontrollable like,

4648
02:10:39,681 --> 02:10:40,191
oh my God,

4649
02:10:40,191 --> 02:10:41,690
he's going to marry Liv Tyler or whatever.

4650
02:10:42,260 --> 02:10:42,921
And uh,

4651
02:10:42,921 --> 02:10:43,101
and,

4652
02:10:43,101 --> 02:10:43,580
but you know,

4653
02:10:43,580 --> 02:10:44,480
normally it wouldn't be like,

4654
02:10:44,510 --> 02:10:47,780
but you can also feel a euphoric.

4655
02:10:47,781 --> 02:10:48,620
You can feel sad,

4656
02:10:48,621 --> 02:10:49,041
you can like,

4657
02:10:49,041 --> 02:10:51,560
it's just a sort of emotion crank,

4658
02:10:51,590 --> 02:10:51,861
you know,

4659
02:10:51,861 --> 02:10:52,041
at,

4660
02:10:52,041 --> 02:10:52,281
at,

4661
02:10:52,281 --> 02:10:53,390
at high altitudes.

4662
02:10:53,930 --> 02:10:54,763
Um,

4663
02:10:56,090 --> 02:10:56,923
what were we talking about?

4664
02:10:57,700 --> 02:10:57,890
Well,

4665
02:10:57,890 --> 02:10:59,120
you were talking about emotions,

4666
02:11:00,190 --> 02:11:00,650
emotions,

4667
02:11:00,650 --> 02:11:00,970
fine.

4668
02:11:00,970 --> 02:11:01,291
Oh yeah,

4669
02:11:01,291 --> 02:11:01,361
yeah,

4670
02:11:01,361 --> 02:11:01,610
yeah.

4671
02:11:01,610 --> 02:11:02,000
Right?

4672
02:11:02,000 --> 02:11:03,710
So when I come back on playing,

4673
02:11:03,711 --> 02:11:05,930
sometimes I have these
emotional things and I'm like,

4674
02:11:05,931 --> 02:11:06,764
you know what?

4675
02:11:06,890 --> 02:11:07,723
Fuck it.

4676
02:11:07,790 --> 02:11:09,770
I'm going to get a place
in the Canadian shield.

4677
02:11:09,771 --> 02:11:10,491
I'm going to get a place,

4678
02:11:10,491 --> 02:11:11,510
just hedge my bets.

4679
02:11:11,690 --> 02:11:13,130
Just maybe shit doesn't go wrong,

4680
02:11:13,131 --> 02:11:14,000
but I always say this,

4681
02:11:14,001 --> 02:11:16,310
if you notice there's a
1% chance or a 5% chance,

4682
02:11:16,490 --> 02:11:17,390
you didn't hedge your bets,

4683
02:11:17,391 --> 02:11:18,224
you're a fucking idiot.

4684
02:11:18,410 --> 02:11:18,861
So I'm like,

4685
02:11:18,861 --> 02:11:19,161
okay,

4686
02:11:19,161 --> 02:11:20,030
I'm going to hedge my bet.

4687
02:11:20,031 --> 02:11:24,110
I'm going to get a place up
in the Canadian shield with
a freshwater lake and no

4688
02:11:24,111 --> 02:11:24,801
one can get to.

4689
02:11:24,801 --> 02:11:27,380
It's hard to get to all this shit and
now you're going to build a fucking

4690
02:11:27,381 --> 02:11:28,330
cottage on there.

4691
02:11:28,580 --> 02:11:30,470
You can have a cottage during the summers.

4692
02:11:30,471 --> 02:11:31,071
And by the way,

4693
02:11:31,071 --> 02:11:32,000
if a shit goes bad,

4694
02:11:32,001 --> 02:11:32,451
you're up there,

4695
02:11:32,451 --> 02:11:32,951
you got water,

4696
02:11:32,951 --> 02:11:33,490
you got all shit.

4697
02:11:33,490 --> 02:11:33,771
Okay,

4698
02:11:33,771 --> 02:11:34,580
fine.

4699
02:11:34,580 --> 02:11:39,580
Now I thought this was a particular sort
of lunacy of my 34,000 foot fly back

4700
02:11:39,741 --> 02:11:41,780
from carpooled to fucking
cheeseburger land.

4701
02:11:42,470 --> 02:11:44,450
And then I started talking to people,

4702
02:11:44,630 --> 02:11:44,990
right,

4703
02:11:44,990 --> 02:11:49,990
who are like running media companies
or journalists or run the bureau out of

4704
02:11:50,841 --> 02:11:51,111
the,

4705
02:11:51,111 --> 02:11:51,690
you know,

4706
02:11:51,690 --> 02:11:52,300
uh,

4707
02:11:52,300 --> 02:11:53,390
Qubole or you know,

4708
02:11:53,391 --> 02:11:53,930
just,

4709
02:11:53,930 --> 02:11:54,140
you know,

4710
02:11:54,140 --> 02:11:58,100
people who have been sort of around the
world are doing every single fucking one

4711
02:11:58,101 --> 02:11:58,730
of them is like,

4712
02:11:58,730 --> 02:11:59,810
I'm going to bolt hole.

4713
02:11:59,990 --> 02:12:00,171
Yeah,

4714
02:12:00,171 --> 02:12:01,760
I got a place in the mountains here.

4715
02:12:02,030 --> 02:12:03,410
I got a place over here.

4716
02:12:03,620 --> 02:12:04,940
I got a place over there.

4717
02:12:05,180 --> 02:12:09,080
And I think it's because you
realize it probably won't happen,

4718
02:12:09,340 --> 02:12:09,950
but,

4719
02:12:09,950 --> 02:12:11,330
and it shouldn't happen.

4720
02:12:11,630 --> 02:12:15,940
And people thought at the end of the
world was coming for a long time and,

4721
02:12:15,941 --> 02:12:17,540
and I'm the least sort of,

4722
02:12:17,560 --> 02:12:17,880
you know,

4723
02:12:17,880 --> 02:12:18,890
conspiracy theory,

4724
02:12:18,891 --> 02:12:19,051
oh,

4725
02:12:19,051 --> 02:12:20,960
we're all going to die kind
of guy and all this shit.

4726
02:12:20,961 --> 02:12:21,370
And I'm like,

4727
02:12:21,370 --> 02:12:26,370
if it hasn't happened before now and
then however you go to enough things like

4728
02:12:27,171 --> 02:12:31,220
Fukushima or like Greenland or like
Dagestan or Pakistan or all these,

4729
02:12:31,221 --> 02:12:32,180
Pakistan by the way,

4730
02:12:32,181 --> 02:12:33,860
is becoming a failed state.

4731
02:12:33,890 --> 02:12:38,890
It has fucking over a hundred warheads
on ms child's ready to fucking go.

4732
02:12:39,350 --> 02:12:42,080
So at a certain point you're just like,

4733
02:12:42,380 --> 02:12:43,460
I'm a gambling man.

4734
02:12:43,820 --> 02:12:45,020
I'm going to hedge my bets.

4735
02:12:45,650 --> 02:12:50,330
I'm going to fucking just have a
bolt hole because if shit goes down,

4736
02:12:50,360 --> 02:12:51,590
why the fuck wouldn't you?

4737
02:12:51,800 --> 02:12:52,100
Yeah.

4738
02:12:52,100 --> 02:12:52,310
And,

4739
02:12:52,310 --> 02:12:56,330
and I didn't think it affected
me until I had that discussion.

4740
02:12:56,331 --> 02:12:57,890
It was one of those
things where it's like,

4741
02:12:58,280 --> 02:12:59,120
I masturbate.

4742
02:12:59,121 --> 02:12:59,321
Yeah.

4743
02:12:59,321 --> 02:12:59,811
So do I.

4744
02:12:59,811 --> 02:13:00,291
So do I,

4745
02:13:00,291 --> 02:13:00,770
you know,

4746
02:13:00,770 --> 02:13:03,700
it's like everybody admitted to we,

4747
02:13:03,860 --> 02:13:06,110
we have this sort of
paranoia and they were all,

4748
02:13:06,111 --> 02:13:07,390
it was kind of like mine to do.

4749
02:13:07,420 --> 02:13:07,881
And I was like,

4750
02:13:07,881 --> 02:13:08,331
Oh fuck,

4751
02:13:08,331 --> 02:13:09,290
it's fucked me up now.

4752
02:13:09,480 --> 02:13:11,150
And then I felt like I have a fucked up,

4753
02:13:11,160 --> 02:13:11,420
huh?

4754
02:13:11,420 --> 02:13:11,631
Yeah.

4755
02:13:11,631 --> 02:13:16,631
When you travel it's hard to deny or
turn an eye to the things that you see

4756
02:13:18,291 --> 02:13:20,810
going on in the conditions
that are in other places.

4757
02:13:20,811 --> 02:13:24,260
And like we are fed the
illest Soma here in America.

4758
02:13:24,261 --> 02:13:27,410
We get the best Soma
and I think it really,

4759
02:13:27,411 --> 02:13:30,170
really blinds us to what's going
on and what could happen to us.

4760
02:13:30,650 --> 02:13:31,480
When you say Sama,

4761
02:13:31,480 --> 02:13:32,940
you don't mean the sleeping pills,

4762
02:13:34,050 --> 02:13:34,861
the brave new world.

4763
02:13:34,861 --> 02:13:35,581
Aldous Huxley,

4764
02:13:35,581 --> 02:13:36,170
like right.

4765
02:13:36,170 --> 02:13:36,750
You know,

4766
02:13:36,750 --> 02:13:37,800
the wool over our eyes.

4767
02:13:37,801 --> 02:13:38,790
Like we have television,

4768
02:13:38,791 --> 02:13:39,630
we have memes,

4769
02:13:39,631 --> 02:13:40,464
we have,

4770
02:13:40,500 --> 02:13:41,100
you know,

4771
02:13:41,100 --> 02:13:42,480
all these things that distract us.

4772
02:13:42,481 --> 02:13:43,680
We have cheap food,

4773
02:13:44,010 --> 02:13:45,450
we have cheap real estate,

4774
02:13:45,480 --> 02:13:46,740
we have cheap loans,

4775
02:13:46,920 --> 02:13:47,281
you know,

4776
02:13:47,281 --> 02:13:47,491
and,

4777
02:13:47,491 --> 02:13:52,020
and so I think it distracts us from the
fact that like these problems that are

4778
02:13:52,021 --> 02:13:55,170
at the water's edge could be
at your door very quickly.

4779
02:13:55,560 --> 02:13:58,350
And you see it like Detroit I
think is the latest example.

4780
02:13:58,770 --> 02:13:59,603
Hmm.

4781
02:13:59,920 --> 02:14:01,300
Detroit as a scary example,

4782
02:14:01,301 --> 02:14:05,860
we were there filming and there were
houses for sell for $500 you buy a house

4783
02:14:05,861 --> 02:14:06,641
for 500 bucks.

4784
02:14:06,641 --> 02:14:08,170
We did a story there that I fucking,

4785
02:14:08,171 --> 02:14:09,004
I'm sorry I didn't,

4786
02:14:09,010 --> 02:14:09,161
no,

4787
02:14:09,161 --> 02:14:09,651
I was going to say,

4788
02:14:09,651 --> 02:14:11,860
and the smell in the air is insane.

4789
02:14:11,890 --> 02:14:14,050
The pollution is so tangible and you feel,

4790
02:14:14,500 --> 02:14:16,780
we have this great story of these uh,

4791
02:14:16,800 --> 02:14:17,633
uh,

4792
02:14:18,040 --> 02:14:18,640
kids,

4793
02:14:18,640 --> 02:14:18,911
you know,

4794
02:14:18,911 --> 02:14:22,570
and they're scrappers and they go into
these houses that are abandoned houses

4795
02:14:22,840 --> 02:14:24,910
and they rip every piece
of metal out of it,

4796
02:14:24,911 --> 02:14:25,570
right?

4797
02:14:25,570 --> 02:14:27,040
And then they sell it to these,

4798
02:14:27,041 --> 02:14:27,641
uh,

4799
02:14:27,641 --> 02:14:28,474
um,

4800
02:14:28,510 --> 02:14:29,343
uh,

4801
02:14:29,470 --> 02:14:32,940
barges and the barges come in and
they fill them with all this crap.

4802
02:14:32,941 --> 02:14:34,120
And all the schools,

4803
02:14:34,121 --> 02:14:35,140
all the old hospitals,

4804
02:14:35,380 --> 02:14:36,790
they're just ripping all the metal out,

4805
02:14:36,820 --> 02:14:37,780
all the girders,

4806
02:14:38,020 --> 02:14:38,770
everything.

4807
02:14:38,770 --> 02:14:43,770
And they ship it to China because
the quest for steel is insatiable.

4808
02:14:44,590 --> 02:14:44,951
So,

4809
02:14:44,951 --> 02:14:46,810
and we founded in Baltimore,

4810
02:14:46,840 --> 02:14:47,890
we did it in Cleveland,

4811
02:14:47,891 --> 02:14:52,000
we did in Detroit where we're ripping
the shit out of our old industrial cities

4812
02:14:52,001 --> 02:14:55,930
and literally melting it down to do
the new industrial cities in China.

4813
02:14:55,990 --> 02:14:57,550
It's so organic.

4814
02:14:57,610 --> 02:14:58,150
It is.

4815
02:14:58,150 --> 02:14:58,930
Right.

4816
02:14:58,930 --> 02:14:59,411
I was like,

4817
02:14:59,411 --> 02:15:02,890
that's kind of a poetic story
actually were pulling down our shit,

4818
02:15:03,280 --> 02:15:05,460
melting it and then building it for the,

4819
02:15:05,560 --> 02:15:07,450
for what they did with the,

4820
02:15:08,350 --> 02:15:09,183
all the record.

4821
02:15:09,740 --> 02:15:11,750
David Shosha shot that for really?

4822
02:15:11,800 --> 02:15:16,540
David Cho is the host of that and
he goes out with the kids as they,

4823
02:15:16,570 --> 02:15:17,030
as they,

4824
02:15:17,030 --> 02:15:17,291
they,

4825
02:15:17,291 --> 02:15:21,840
they rip these buildings every fucking
like big industrial schools and she had

4826
02:15:21,850 --> 02:15:25,180
factories and they just
take all the fucking didn't,

4827
02:15:25,470 --> 02:15:25,800
that's,

4828
02:15:25,800 --> 02:15:26,650
that's so crazy.

4829
02:15:26,651 --> 02:15:28,400
Who didn't that isn't that
what they did with the,

4830
02:15:28,401 --> 02:15:30,220
with the twin towers
when they fell as well?

4831
02:15:30,221 --> 02:15:31,570
Didn't they sell the scrap to China?

4832
02:15:31,630 --> 02:15:31,721
Oh,

4833
02:15:31,721 --> 02:15:32,231
I don't know.

4834
02:15:32,231 --> 02:15:32,741
That's interesting.

4835
02:15:32,741 --> 02:15:33,640
I'm pretty sure they did.

4836
02:15:33,700 --> 02:15:37,360
I'm pretty sure they a box it
all up and ship that North Korea,

4837
02:15:37,361 --> 02:15:38,500
when you go around North Korea,

4838
02:15:38,501 --> 02:15:40,600
all the buildings have like all these big,

4839
02:15:40,710 --> 02:15:41,580
like they looked like they,

4840
02:15:42,090 --> 02:15:42,923
uh,

4841
02:15:43,060 --> 02:15:47,500
concrete woodpecker has packed away at
them cause they pull out the rebar and

4842
02:15:47,501 --> 02:15:50,140
then they sell the rebar to
China's scrap and you're like,

4843
02:15:50,320 --> 02:15:50,770
wow,

4844
02:15:50,770 --> 02:15:51,101
hold on.

4845
02:15:51,101 --> 02:15:52,780
You're going to make your whole fucking,

4846
02:15:53,080 --> 02:15:53,350
I mean,

4847
02:15:53,350 --> 02:15:55,660
how much money can you
get for that much rebar?

4848
02:15:55,910 --> 02:15:58,150
Like 500 bucks,

4849
02:15:59,310 --> 02:16:00,420
get the contact.

4850
02:16:00,480 --> 02:16:00,961
Do you know what I mean?

4851
02:16:00,961 --> 02:16:02,100
Like if you're stealing,

4852
02:16:02,160 --> 02:16:03,450
if you're a scrapper and Detroit,

4853
02:16:03,451 --> 02:16:06,570
how did you get in touch with people
that melt this down and then sell it to

4854
02:16:06,571 --> 02:16:07,370
China?

4855
02:16:07,370 --> 02:16:07,461
No,

4856
02:16:07,461 --> 02:16:07,640
no,

4857
02:16:07,640 --> 02:16:10,850
because China's buying
essentially all the scrap.

4858
02:16:10,851 --> 02:16:14,060
They have such a desire for steel and
steel is expensive and hard to me.

4859
02:16:14,300 --> 02:16:17,750
So to get scrapped and then melted
down is actually more cost efficient.

4860
02:16:17,751 --> 02:16:19,310
Even shipping it across the world.

4861
02:16:19,790 --> 02:16:22,220
So what they're doing
is not just in America,

4862
02:16:22,221 --> 02:16:23,990
there are anywhere where
they can send scrap.

4863
02:16:24,020 --> 02:16:26,000
The open order is send it here.

4864
02:16:26,270 --> 02:16:28,340
It's not just get Detroit's,

4865
02:16:28,650 --> 02:16:29,050
you know,

4866
02:16:29,050 --> 02:16:30,100
schools and give them,

4867
02:16:30,100 --> 02:16:30,671
to me it's,

4868
02:16:30,671 --> 02:16:31,420
it's,

4869
02:16:31,420 --> 02:16:31,990
it's,

4870
02:16:31,990 --> 02:16:32,800
you know,

4871
02:16:32,800 --> 02:16:34,630
they're just taking all
the scrap from everywhere.

4872
02:16:34,660 --> 02:16:35,170
Yeah,

4873
02:16:35,170 --> 02:16:37,540
there's a demand and then it
filters down Zachary Hood.

4874
02:16:37,900 --> 02:16:38,740
Wow.

4875
02:16:39,430 --> 02:16:39,881
What's that?

4876
02:16:39,881 --> 02:16:43,490
So it's such a weird and
ironic twist to our store,

4877
02:16:43,491 --> 02:16:43,990
isn't it?

4878
02:16:43,990 --> 02:16:45,520
What a poetic fucking,

4879
02:16:45,580 --> 02:16:50,580
we sold off our manufacturing overseas
to the WTO and all the different bills

4880
02:16:51,640 --> 02:16:56,640
they pass that cut out the
manufacturing base in this country,

4881
02:16:56,830 --> 02:17:00,090
and then they slowly extract the
metal and ship it into the over to.

4882
02:17:00,310 --> 02:17:03,970
We're living off the sort of remnants
of that society and we're like taking

4883
02:17:03,971 --> 02:17:05,790
everything and going salad salad.

4884
02:17:05,990 --> 02:17:06,880
So weird.

4885
02:17:07,120 --> 02:17:07,391
You know,

4886
02:17:07,391 --> 02:17:11,140
Detroit has started to make a
comeback as far as cars at least.

4887
02:17:11,190 --> 02:17:11,410
Yeah.

4888
02:17:11,410 --> 02:17:12,610
At least American cars,

4889
02:17:12,611 --> 02:17:14,350
they started producing real cars again,

4890
02:17:14,351 --> 02:17:15,580
like Cadillac one,

4891
02:17:15,581 --> 02:17:17,640
the car the year motor
trend car of the year.

4892
02:17:17,950 --> 02:17:18,220
Yeah,

4893
02:17:18,220 --> 02:17:20,880
the CTS V it's a fucking bad ass car.

4894
02:17:20,980 --> 02:17:22,540
It's a technological marvel.

4895
02:17:22,541 --> 02:17:25,390
It handles as good as any German
car that's ever been made.

4896
02:17:25,391 --> 02:17:27,200
The build quality spectacular they have.

4897
02:17:27,360 --> 02:17:28,600
They're actually making real cars.

4898
02:17:29,040 --> 02:17:31,300
The new corvette or the new Corvettes.

4899
02:17:31,301 --> 02:17:31,960
Amazing.

4900
02:17:31,960 --> 02:17:33,070
It's an amazing car.

4901
02:17:33,071 --> 02:17:35,470
They're making cars
that people want to buy,

4902
02:17:35,740 --> 02:17:36,573
like finally,

4903
02:17:36,730 --> 02:17:37,481
but God damn,

4904
02:17:37,481 --> 02:17:39,280
they fucked it up for a long time.

4905
02:17:39,970 --> 02:17:43,300
You remember from the
70s until like today,

4906
02:17:43,570 --> 02:17:44,890
American cars were a joke.

4907
02:17:44,920 --> 02:17:46,600
If you weren't buying a Ford pickup truck,

4908
02:17:46,810 --> 02:17:49,630
those really solid as a
rock Chevy pickup trucks,

4909
02:17:49,780 --> 02:17:50,980
like things along those lines.

4910
02:17:51,130 --> 02:17:53,290
Most of American cars were dog shit.

4911
02:17:54,070 --> 02:17:54,251
Yeah.

4912
02:17:54,251 --> 02:17:56,770
What was quality control talk shit.

4913
02:17:56,771 --> 02:17:57,730
You have to give a shit.

4914
02:17:58,230 --> 02:18:02,900
And the thing is is Japanese people I
ended up started lunch really were like

4915
02:18:02,910 --> 02:18:03,610
give a shit.

4916
02:18:03,610 --> 02:18:03,911
Yeah.

4917
02:18:03,911 --> 02:18:04,481
Their culture,

4918
02:18:04,481 --> 02:18:04,681
their,

4919
02:18:04,681 --> 02:18:07,420
they're missing all the fucking
crucial elements that make,

4920
02:18:07,421 --> 02:18:09,670
every American thinks that
he's awesome individually,

4921
02:18:10,500 --> 02:18:13,030
so much so that they're not
willing to succeed to the group.

4922
02:18:13,330 --> 02:18:13,961
You know,

4923
02:18:13,961 --> 02:18:14,561
in Japan,

4924
02:18:14,561 --> 02:18:17,290
like it's a big part of working at a
factory is that everything is for the

4925
02:18:17,291 --> 02:18:17,740
company.

4926
02:18:17,740 --> 02:18:19,630
Everything for company and they,

4927
02:18:19,631 --> 02:18:20,320
you know,

4928
02:18:20,320 --> 02:18:23,410
they take pride in the fact
that the company does well also,

4929
02:18:23,411 --> 02:18:24,430
if you go to any like,

4930
02:18:24,760 --> 02:18:25,270
you know,

4931
02:18:25,270 --> 02:18:28,510
shitty five o'clock
fucking drunk ramen place,

4932
02:18:28,720 --> 02:18:31,540
they'd been boiling that stock for
two days and everything's perfect.

4933
02:18:31,780 --> 02:18:33,640
You go to a Shitty Yakitori place.

4934
02:18:33,790 --> 02:18:37,210
It's like they've met the make it
the best they possibly fucking can.

4935
02:18:37,450 --> 02:18:38,680
And it's like they give a shit.

4936
02:18:39,230 --> 02:18:40,990
If I'm going to make fucking Yakitori,

4937
02:18:40,991 --> 02:18:41,651
it's going to be the best.

4938
02:18:41,651 --> 02:18:43,180
God Damn Yakitori I can possibly,

4939
02:18:43,360 --> 02:18:43,571
yeah,

4940
02:18:43,571 --> 02:18:46,960
we got this entitled attitude in
this country or I shouldn't say we.

4941
02:18:46,961 --> 02:18:48,340
Some people have this,

4942
02:18:48,341 --> 02:18:50,140
it's a poison of character.

4943
02:18:50,320 --> 02:18:50,920
Sure.

4944
02:18:50,920 --> 02:18:55,120
And it's a great fucking Yakitori fuck it.

4945
02:18:55,121 --> 02:18:55,871
I'm going to make it shit.

4946
02:18:55,871 --> 02:18:56,291
And you're like,

4947
02:18:56,291 --> 02:18:58,330
well hold on if you're
going to fucking do it.

4948
02:18:58,750 --> 02:19:00,870
But he has anything to do anything.

4949
02:19:01,090 --> 02:19:01,281
Yeah.

4950
02:19:01,281 --> 02:19:05,110
Shane pointed out the Ramen Yakitori
it makes sense because there's a lot of

4951
02:19:05,111 --> 02:19:08,140
chefs that get a lot of a claim in this
country simply for the fact that they

4952
02:19:08,141 --> 02:19:11,350
speak English because they
can communicate it better.

4953
02:19:11,500 --> 02:19:15,400
They have the money to open a Yaki Tory
place in the right neighborhood where

4954
02:19:15,401 --> 02:19:17,170
writers live where it's accessible,

4955
02:19:17,440 --> 02:19:18,580
but they usually,

4956
02:19:19,060 --> 02:19:20,860
it's not about authentic or whatever.

4957
02:19:20,861 --> 02:19:25,450
It's exactly what you talked about is
the person from that culture probably

4958
02:19:25,451 --> 02:19:27,710
gives a shit more because it them

4959
02:19:28,160 --> 02:19:31,700
in a lot of people like young
chefs and things like that,

4960
02:19:31,701 --> 02:19:36,020
they think that they can
go over to someplace for a
couple of weeks and be like,

4961
02:19:36,050 --> 02:19:36,171
oh,

4962
02:19:36,171 --> 02:19:38,150
I can make yagats where
I can make ramen this.

4963
02:19:38,390 --> 02:19:39,380
This is easy stuff.

4964
02:19:39,381 --> 02:19:39,561
You know,

4965
02:19:39,561 --> 02:19:41,000
like that Guy Ivan Ramen,

4966
02:19:41,001 --> 02:19:41,571
he's very,

4967
02:19:41,571 --> 02:19:42,321
very famous.

4968
02:19:42,321 --> 02:19:43,730
He did ramen in Japan,

4969
02:19:43,731 --> 02:19:45,140
but he lived that shit.

4970
02:19:45,620 --> 02:19:45,831
You know,

4971
02:19:45,831 --> 02:19:47,570
you really have to lie.

4972
02:19:48,370 --> 02:19:50,030
He named himself after the soup.

4973
02:19:50,690 --> 02:19:51,110
Yeah.

4974
02:19:51,110 --> 02:19:52,430
Or he was lame that anyway.

4975
02:19:52,431 --> 02:19:53,330
And he became,

4976
02:19:53,390 --> 02:19:54,000
because he was,

4977
02:19:54,000 --> 02:19:54,741
I'm not sure,

4978
02:19:54,741 --> 02:19:56,150
he opened a place in New York.

4979
02:19:56,151 --> 02:19:57,260
It's like all the buzz.

4980
02:19:57,261 --> 02:19:57,981
I haven't been yet.

4981
02:19:57,981 --> 02:19:58,521
Nice guy.

4982
02:19:58,521 --> 02:19:58,811
Met Him.

4983
02:19:58,811 --> 02:20:00,520
If his name was Ivan Ramen,

4984
02:20:01,130 --> 02:20:05,360
then it would be interesting to find
out if because of his name he became Mr

4985
02:20:05,361 --> 02:20:06,141
Ramen or if,

4986
02:20:06,141 --> 02:20:06,501
because,

4987
02:20:06,501 --> 02:20:09,830
just because I just think
his restaurant was named,

4988
02:20:09,960 --> 02:20:10,850
I'm not sure.

4989
02:20:10,890 --> 02:20:11,910
Did you ever see that one?

4990
02:20:11,911 --> 02:20:12,744
And um,

4991
02:20:12,840 --> 02:20:14,100
Tony Robbins special,

4992
02:20:14,600 --> 02:20:15,180
um,

4993
02:20:15,180 --> 02:20:16,860
where he went to not Tony Robbins.

4994
02:20:17,010 --> 02:20:17,843
Tony Bourdain's,

4995
02:20:18,360 --> 02:20:19,193
Jesus Christ.

4996
02:20:19,230 --> 02:20:20,910
Where you have seen the Tony Robbins one.

4997
02:20:21,140 --> 02:20:23,040
I feel fuck Tony Robbins noodle special.

4998
02:20:23,750 --> 02:20:25,950
And there was this one dude who was,

4999
02:20:25,951 --> 02:20:29,760
had been making noodles the same way
his family had been making noodles for

5000
02:20:30,090 --> 02:20:30,680
fucking,

5001
02:20:30,680 --> 02:20:30,990
you know,

5002
02:20:30,990 --> 02:20:34,120
how many things popping up was out sick.

5003
02:20:34,380 --> 02:20:35,730
Wasn't that amazing?

5004
02:20:35,750 --> 02:20:36,090
Yeah.

5005
02:20:36,090 --> 02:20:36,421
I mean,

5006
02:20:36,421 --> 02:20:39,720
watch this guy make
noodles all fucking day.

5007
02:20:39,750 --> 02:20:40,330
Press it.

5008
02:20:40,330 --> 02:20:40,741
Make any,

5009
02:20:40,741 --> 02:20:42,500
see what physical labor it is.

5010
02:20:42,510 --> 02:20:42,960
Yeah,

5011
02:20:42,960 --> 02:20:47,610
and this guy is just a master and make
noodles and I never considered that there

5012
02:20:47,611 --> 02:20:49,140
was an art to making noodles

5013
02:20:50,220 --> 02:20:50,980
that here.

5014
02:20:50,980 --> 02:20:53,380
Like if some kid from
Culinary Institute of America,

5015
02:20:53,650 --> 02:20:54,790
I hang out with these other shifts.

5016
02:20:54,791 --> 02:20:56,230
If somebody was doing that here,

5017
02:20:56,440 --> 02:21:00,130
he'd put that guy in a glass case in
the front of his restaurant where a chef

5018
02:21:00,131 --> 02:21:00,731
coat and be like,

5019
02:21:00,731 --> 02:21:01,330
give me awards.

5020
02:21:01,330 --> 02:21:01,880
I deserve it.

5021
02:21:01,880 --> 02:21:02,740
Do you see what I'm doing?

5022
02:21:02,741 --> 02:21:03,250
It's like,

5023
02:21:03,250 --> 02:21:03,521
dude,

5024
02:21:03,521 --> 02:21:04,240
chill.

5025
02:21:04,240 --> 02:21:05,550
You know you should do it because that's,

5026
02:21:05,730 --> 02:21:10,730
that's a good side chef talk a lot of
people mad about people wanting to awards.

5027
02:21:10,850 --> 02:21:11,790
I'm the Kanye West.

5028
02:21:11,791 --> 02:21:12,624
The chefs,

5029
02:21:12,690 --> 02:21:12,991
no,

5030
02:21:12,991 --> 02:21:14,430
I don't even submit to those things.

5031
02:21:17,450 --> 02:21:18,410
I had met these sites,

5032
02:21:18,570 --> 02:21:20,220
Julia Child Bitch.

5033
02:21:21,060 --> 02:21:21,890
That shit is funny.

5034
02:21:21,890 --> 02:21:26,340
Was going to step up and give me the
[inaudible] money to one my new fast food

5035
02:21:26,341 --> 02:21:26,840
joint.

5036
02:21:26,840 --> 02:21:28,590
Who's the best chef in the world?

5037
02:21:29,930 --> 02:21:30,860
I think that's,

5038
02:21:30,950 --> 02:21:32,420
I don't think that's Dario say.

5039
02:21:33,200 --> 02:21:33,430
Go.

5040
02:21:33,430 --> 02:21:33,921
Do you ask her?

5041
02:21:33,921 --> 02:21:35,390
She'll know what question I could answer.

5042
02:21:35,391 --> 02:21:37,460
I can't answer like who's
the best chef in the world?

5043
02:21:37,461 --> 02:21:41,870
I think there's no answer that I will
say that there's one set I met that I

5044
02:21:41,871 --> 02:21:43,970
would bet I do bowel too in the,

5045
02:21:43,971 --> 02:21:48,971
I'm like his fucking grasshopper and
when I see him he inspires me and I just

5046
02:21:49,881 --> 02:21:52,250
want to be a fly on the wall in his
kitchen and hanging out with him.

5047
02:21:52,251 --> 02:21:53,090
He's the best master.

5048
02:21:53,091 --> 02:21:57,050
You incestuous and he's been
featured in like Fuchsia Dunlop.

5049
02:21:57,220 --> 02:21:58,110
I'm going to say Emeril.

5050
02:21:59,680 --> 02:22:00,750
Emeril is also the man.

5051
02:22:00,780 --> 02:22:01,260
Damn,

5052
02:22:01,260 --> 02:22:02,093
I met Emeril.

5053
02:22:02,100 --> 02:22:02,700
Emeril.

5054
02:22:02,700 --> 02:22:03,660
Emeril is a stand

5055
02:22:03,660 --> 02:22:04,091
up dude.

5056
02:22:04,091 --> 02:22:04,924
Really cool,

5057
02:22:04,960 --> 02:22:06,970
really cool down our through
to really knows his food.

5058
02:22:06,971 --> 02:22:09,580
But master you in Chengdu.

5059
02:22:09,581 --> 02:22:10,360
I met,

5060
02:22:10,360 --> 02:22:12,400
cooked me some of the
best meals I've ever seen.

5061
02:22:12,401 --> 02:22:16,750
And then he also kind of showed me
new techniques on dishes that I'd been

5062
02:22:16,751 --> 02:22:17,740
cooking for years.

5063
02:22:17,800 --> 02:22:18,150
Right.

5064
02:22:18,150 --> 02:22:18,940
And,

5065
02:22:18,940 --> 02:22:19,751
and that's dope.

5066
02:22:19,751 --> 02:22:22,720
When somebody can take something you've
been doing for so long and be like,

5067
02:22:23,020 --> 02:22:24,040
check it out this way.

5068
02:22:24,370 --> 02:22:25,203
Like what was the,

5069
02:22:25,260 --> 02:22:25,831
in the variations,

5070
02:22:25,831 --> 02:22:27,300
what were the dish that he cooked for you?

5071
02:22:27,570 --> 02:22:27,901
All right.

5072
02:22:27,901 --> 02:22:32,670
So the simplest thing was
the most impressive thing
that he taught me was Chili

5073
02:22:32,670 --> 02:22:32,970
Oil,

5074
02:22:32,970 --> 02:22:33,570
right?

5075
02:22:33,570 --> 02:22:38,230
People will always have an issue with
temperature and making Chili oil to get it

5076
02:22:38,231 --> 02:22:40,500
at the right temperature and use the
thermometer and things like that.

5077
02:22:41,070 --> 02:22:42,060
Chili oil,

5078
02:22:42,120 --> 02:22:47,120
what he does is he heats up his oil to
a certain point where canola oil will be

5079
02:22:47,401 --> 02:22:48,330
a little yellow at first.

5080
02:22:48,330 --> 02:22:50,670
He'll heat heated up so
hot that it becomes white,

5081
02:22:51,270 --> 02:22:52,800
let the temperature drop.

5082
02:22:52,980 --> 02:22:57,210
Then he'll heat it up till it's hot
to the touch and put it over the chili

5083
02:22:57,211 --> 02:22:58,044
grounds,

5084
02:22:58,200 --> 02:23:03,000
and that'll be like an encasing so
that when he puts hotter oil on top,

5085
02:23:03,150 --> 02:23:04,740
it won't burn the Chili Oil.

5086
02:23:04,920 --> 02:23:06,150
So he'll cook it in a,

5087
02:23:06,840 --> 02:23:09,030
in an oil that's just
slightly hot to touch.

5088
02:23:09,300 --> 02:23:12,480
Then he'll heat it up another
60 degrees or something,

5089
02:23:12,690 --> 02:23:16,560
put more of that oil and then he'll
get it ripping hot and put that oil in,

5090
02:23:16,760 --> 02:23:18,900
but the Chili never burns.

5091
02:23:18,960 --> 02:23:23,960
And then you can also see how the flavor
of the chilies and the smell of the

5092
02:23:24,211 --> 02:23:26,940
Chili's changes at every temperature.

5093
02:23:27,390 --> 02:23:29,730
And that is the hallmark of session one.

5094
02:23:29,731 --> 02:23:30,001
Cooking.

5095
02:23:30,001 --> 02:23:31,440
That is the thing that's most amazing.

5096
02:23:31,710 --> 02:23:35,730
They took a couple ingredients but one
especially is the red dried chili pepper

5097
02:23:36,060 --> 02:23:37,800
and just because of temperature.

5098
02:23:38,610 --> 02:23:39,320
Yes.

5099
02:23:39,320 --> 02:23:40,153
Hold on Brian.

5100
02:23:40,260 --> 02:23:43,470
I need to feel the energy just because
the temperature just because of

5101
02:23:43,471 --> 02:23:44,100
temperature,

5102
02:23:44,100 --> 02:23:48,600
that one ingredient can become so many
different things and it's like that,

5103
02:23:48,990 --> 02:23:50,490
that culture of cooking sesh,

5104
02:23:50,491 --> 02:23:54,480
one cooking in China pays that much
attention to almost every ingredient

5105
02:23:54,481 --> 02:23:55,320
available to them,

5106
02:23:55,620 --> 02:23:59,370
but us now like our culinary revolution,

5107
02:23:59,371 --> 02:24:04,371
so to speak in America is such a like
pho revolution to me like in other like

5108
02:24:05,581 --> 02:24:06,001
France,

5109
02:24:06,001 --> 02:24:06,840
you go to France,

5110
02:24:06,841 --> 02:24:07,770
you go to China,

5111
02:24:08,160 --> 02:24:12,000
there's people been cooking and doing
these things for 5,000 years and this is

5112
02:24:12,001 --> 02:24:13,740
what their parents teach
them in their homes.

5113
02:24:13,741 --> 02:24:14,850
It's really cool.

5114
02:24:15,030 --> 02:24:15,750
Sorry.

5115
02:24:15,750 --> 02:24:16,111
Wow,

5116
02:24:16,111 --> 02:24:17,580
that's fascinating shit man.

5117
02:24:17,780 --> 02:24:21,240
The idea deer that they've
figured out how to not overheated.

5118
02:24:21,600 --> 02:24:21,851
That's,

5119
02:24:21,851 --> 02:24:22,380
yeah,

5120
02:24:22,380 --> 02:24:24,810
and that's why I don't like
read the food blogs here,

5121
02:24:24,811 --> 02:24:29,280
but I will travel and are go into any
place and I want to see like your,

5122
02:24:29,340 --> 02:24:30,330
your technique.

5123
02:24:30,360 --> 02:24:30,601
Like,

5124
02:24:30,601 --> 02:24:31,710
that's what I'm looking for.

5125
02:24:32,010 --> 02:24:34,620
I don't care about like fancy
restaurants or ambiance.

5126
02:24:35,130 --> 02:24:39,360
I want to see technique and it's really
fun to see someone takes something so

5127
02:24:39,361 --> 02:24:41,420
simple that's available to you everyday.

5128
02:24:41,430 --> 02:24:41,870
It's,

5129
02:24:41,870 --> 02:24:42,570
it's a walk.

5130
02:24:42,570 --> 02:24:44,310
It's oil and it's a dry chili pepper.

5131
02:24:44,311 --> 02:24:45,420
You can fuck with it all day.

5132
02:24:46,270 --> 02:24:46,750
Sorry,

5133
02:24:46,750 --> 02:24:50,230
I just wanted to ask him a
question because I love such one.

5134
02:24:50,231 --> 02:24:51,280
And I love Chili.

5135
02:24:51,310 --> 02:24:51,911
I'm a Columbia,

5136
02:24:51,911 --> 02:24:54,180
Chile fanatic and uh,

5137
02:24:54,320 --> 02:24:54,780
uh,

5138
02:24:54,780 --> 02:24:55,110
uh,

5139
02:24:55,110 --> 02:24:55,781
I'm Irish.

5140
02:24:55,781 --> 02:24:56,111
So,

5141
02:24:56,111 --> 02:24:56,720
uh,

5142
02:24:56,720 --> 02:24:57,090
what,

5143
02:24:57,090 --> 02:24:57,730
what Chile,

5144
02:24:57,730 --> 02:24:58,590
Chile does to me.

5145
02:24:58,600 --> 02:24:58,930
What,

5146
02:24:58,930 --> 02:25:00,580
what a beef does to you.

5147
02:25:01,300 --> 02:25:02,290
But I'm addicted to it.

5148
02:25:02,291 --> 02:25:04,180
I love Chili or all
different kinds of Chili,

5149
02:25:04,630 --> 02:25:05,920
but I love session.

5150
02:25:06,140 --> 02:25:06,940
But I,

5151
02:25:06,940 --> 02:25:10,180
it was only when I went there that
I realized they have to spices.

5152
02:25:10,300 --> 02:25:15,300
They have chili and Mung and I
never had it before going to China.

5153
02:25:16,901 --> 02:25:19,200
I think it's illegal
actually to do here maybe.

5154
02:25:19,720 --> 02:25:20,530
But you know,

5155
02:25:20,530 --> 02:25:22,600
in China and in session one dishes,

5156
02:25:23,050 --> 02:25:24,070
there's tons and tons

5157
02:25:24,070 --> 02:25:24,370
of monk.

5158
02:25:24,370 --> 02:25:25,390
Do you know what Hmong is?

5159
02:25:25,510 --> 02:25:26,343
No.

5160
02:25:26,440 --> 02:25:31,060
It's a spice that they put in
the dels don't numbs your mouth.

5161
02:25:31,510 --> 02:25:32,050
Your tongue.

5162
02:25:32,050 --> 02:25:33,200
You mean like peppercorn?

5163
02:25:33,990 --> 02:25:34,823
Yeah,

5164
02:25:35,250 --> 02:25:36,083
yeah,

5165
02:25:36,960 --> 02:25:37,800
they have it here.

5166
02:25:37,801 --> 02:25:40,770
We just have dried session on
peppercorn mostly available.

5167
02:25:40,980 --> 02:25:42,990
Some restaurants can
get green pepper corn,

5168
02:25:43,170 --> 02:25:44,640
but the green pepper corn,

5169
02:25:44,760 --> 02:25:46,590
it's like eating a Newport cigarette.

5170
02:25:46,920 --> 02:25:47,880
It's kind of amazing.

5171
02:25:47,910 --> 02:25:48,743
I love

5172
02:25:49,770 --> 02:25:51,360
eating a Newport cigarette.

5173
02:25:52,250 --> 02:25:53,130
Calms your mouth.

5174
02:25:53,190 --> 02:25:53,670
Yeah.

5175
02:25:53,670 --> 02:25:54,690
Numbs your tongue.

5176
02:25:54,930 --> 02:25:56,280
It numbs your whole fucking shit.

5177
02:25:56,310 --> 02:25:57,143
It's amazing.

5178
02:25:57,150 --> 02:25:58,140
Now let me ask you this,

5179
02:25:58,141 --> 02:25:59,950
cause I don't understand
chilies or peppers.

5180
02:26:00,620 --> 02:26:01,830
Why in New Mexico?

5181
02:26:01,831 --> 02:26:03,720
Why is New Mexico famous for Chili's?

5182
02:26:03,721 --> 02:26:04,650
Hatch Green Chiles.

5183
02:26:04,720 --> 02:26:06,150
What is the deal?

5184
02:26:06,240 --> 02:26:08,190
It's native to them and Chihuahua.

5185
02:26:08,380 --> 02:26:09,090
Yeah,

5186
02:26:09,090 --> 02:26:11,540
but you can go screen breast screen her.

5187
02:26:11,750 --> 02:26:12,300
They'll like,

5188
02:26:12,300 --> 02:26:13,790
they cook them for you and they'll,

5189
02:26:13,791 --> 02:26:17,250
they'll freeze them and ship them to
you and they're worth getting from New

5190
02:26:17,250 --> 02:26:17,310
Mexico.

5191
02:26:17,310 --> 02:26:18,143
Oh yes.

5192
02:26:18,900 --> 02:26:19,681
It's really cool.

5193
02:26:19,681 --> 02:26:20,371
Those reasons,

5194
02:26:20,371 --> 02:26:24,210
like New Orleans has the creole tomato
that's only available for about like six

5195
02:26:24,211 --> 02:26:27,270
weeks out of the year and it's
almost like a fruit tomato.

5196
02:26:27,590 --> 02:26:29,670
Then you have like the hatch
green chilies in New Mexico,

5197
02:26:29,671 --> 02:26:34,080
like America has this amazing produce
that's native to the country and it's cool

5198
02:26:34,081 --> 02:26:39,081
to go on the ground to these regions
where they've played with it for hundreds

5199
02:26:39,210 --> 02:26:39,570
of years.

5200
02:26:39,570 --> 02:26:40,860
The hatch green shows,

5201
02:26:40,920 --> 02:26:42,610
what they were saying
was that it was just not,

5202
02:26:42,630 --> 02:26:44,100
it's not a super spicy Chili.

5203
02:26:44,101 --> 02:26:44,761
It's delicious.

5204
02:26:44,761 --> 02:26:45,594
Tastes delicious.

5205
02:26:45,900 --> 02:26:46,733
Yeah.

5206
02:26:46,890 --> 02:26:51,180
We were shooting that Mitt
Romney or not Mitt Romney,

5207
02:26:51,181 --> 02:26:52,014
Romney,

5208
02:26:52,200 --> 02:26:57,200
the Mormon colonies in Chihuahua and we
were there like a couple of weeks and I

5209
02:26:57,661 --> 02:26:58,201
was just going,

5210
02:26:58,201 --> 02:26:59,340
what the fuck is,

5211
02:26:59,341 --> 02:27:04,341
this shit is awesome and it's the Hash
Green Chili or Hatch Green Chili Salt,

5212
02:27:05,400 --> 02:27:08,280
which is the best shit
I've ever had and it's an,

5213
02:27:08,370 --> 02:27:11,400
it's an Amit to a Chihuahua
was like the meat,

5214
02:27:11,490 --> 02:27:12,323
you know,

5215
02:27:12,330 --> 02:27:15,360
and so they have stakes and they have a
shit and you have a barbecue steak and

5216
02:27:15,361 --> 02:27:16,230
they just pour this,

5217
02:27:16,280 --> 02:27:16,620
this,

5218
02:27:16,620 --> 02:27:17,520
this chili on top.

5219
02:27:17,550 --> 02:27:18,600
It's the best fucking thing

5220
02:27:18,810 --> 02:27:19,471
in New Mexico.

5221
02:27:19,471 --> 02:27:20,550
They use it with antelope.

5222
02:27:20,551 --> 02:27:23,940
They have a lot of antelope pronghorn
antelopes in New Mexico and they cook it.

5223
02:27:23,941 --> 02:27:25,200
That's where I saw these Chili's.

5224
02:27:25,201 --> 02:27:26,850
It was on the show meat eater.

5225
02:27:26,851 --> 02:27:28,350
They shot an antelope and then they,

5226
02:27:28,351 --> 02:27:28,501
uh,

5227
02:27:28,501 --> 02:27:30,080
they cooked it with a,

5228
02:27:30,160 --> 02:27:32,090
these chilies New Mexico
style and they do,

5229
02:27:32,091 --> 02:27:34,410
we'll just raving about how good
these chilies off shows are.

5230
02:27:34,411 --> 02:27:34,890
Fantastic.

5231
02:27:34,890 --> 02:27:35,760
I've got to get some of that shit.

5232
02:27:35,940 --> 02:27:36,940
I'm going to get some of you,

5233
02:27:36,950 --> 02:27:37,381
if you,

5234
02:27:37,381 --> 02:27:37,861
if you,

5235
02:27:37,861 --> 02:27:38,940
if you know the place,

5236
02:27:38,941 --> 02:27:40,830
I'm going to get some
because I fucking love that.

5237
02:27:40,870 --> 02:27:41,161
All right,

5238
02:27:41,161 --> 02:27:41,480
well let's see.

5239
02:27:41,480 --> 02:27:44,990
How long you in town
for ever in La for this?

5240
02:27:45,130 --> 02:27:45,963
I'm living with you now.

5241
02:27:46,010 --> 02:27:46,410
All right.

5242
02:27:46,410 --> 02:27:46,591
Okay.

5243
02:27:46,591 --> 02:27:47,424
We'll figure it out.

5244
02:27:49,550 --> 02:27:50,800
Moving to the commune.

5245
02:27:50,810 --> 02:27:52,220
Isn't that why you invited us here?

5246
02:27:52,260 --> 02:27:52,741
We're here.

5247
02:27:52,741 --> 02:27:53,111
We're queer.

5248
02:27:53,111 --> 02:27:54,390
And I brought my,

5249
02:27:54,391 --> 02:27:54,750
uh,

5250
02:27:54,750 --> 02:27:55,770
Nike's and my,

5251
02:27:55,771 --> 02:27:56,040
uh,

5252
02:27:56,040 --> 02:27:57,090
we don't need Nike's man,

5253
02:27:57,091 --> 02:27:58,350
Nike of bad record.

5254
02:27:58,710 --> 02:27:59,460
We need a,

5255
02:27:59,460 --> 02:28:02,520
we're going to go with converse
all stars because they're weird.

5256
02:28:02,780 --> 02:28:03,780
That's a weird one.

5257
02:28:04,570 --> 02:28:04,790
Eight,

5258
02:28:04,790 --> 02:28:06,870
six is it gives you like an athletic air.

5259
02:28:06,871 --> 02:28:08,250
Like what am I wrestler?

5260
02:28:08,370 --> 02:28:09,530
Sounds weird.

5261
02:28:10,250 --> 02:28:10,620
Um,

5262
02:28:10,620 --> 02:28:11,760
I wanted to talk to you about that.

5263
02:28:11,761 --> 02:28:13,950
I had a funny conversation
with Jimmy Kimmel today,

5264
02:28:14,250 --> 02:28:14,641
uh,

5265
02:28:14,641 --> 02:28:17,910
about that drug that you
guys covered on vice.

5266
02:28:17,911 --> 02:28:19,160
That devil's watching.

5267
02:28:19,550 --> 02:28:22,300
[inaudible] pulling scopolamine

5268
02:28:22,320 --> 02:28:25,850
means the same shit that they put in
the patch to they give to people when

5269
02:28:25,851 --> 02:28:26,684
they're seasick.

5270
02:28:27,560 --> 02:28:31,670
My doctor told me that's Cupola mean
is like regularly prescribed for people

5271
02:28:31,671 --> 02:28:32,990
that have sea sick when they have the path

5272
02:28:33,330 --> 02:28:34,520
in the different dosages.

5273
02:28:34,521 --> 02:28:36,590
Like basically what this cupola mean,

5274
02:28:36,591 --> 02:28:37,341
that is the,

5275
02:28:37,341 --> 02:28:41,000
is the Zombie drug is like
the heroin level alkaloid,

5276
02:28:41,210 --> 02:28:42,043
you know what I mean?

5277
02:28:42,260 --> 02:28:45,710
And then this could pull the mean
in the patches like the aspirin.

5278
02:28:45,850 --> 02:28:46,700
Well that's because,

5279
02:28:46,750 --> 02:28:46,940
uh,

5280
02:28:46,940 --> 02:28:47,190
the,

5281
02:28:47,190 --> 02:28:51,010
the reason why I was bringing this up is
a Jimmy Kimmel was telling me that him

5282
02:28:51,011 --> 02:28:55,780
and Adam Carolla had the patches on
and they had a couple of beers and they

5283
02:28:55,781 --> 02:28:59,950
allegedly might've been around someone
else who was smoking illegal marijuana.

5284
02:28:59,951 --> 02:29:01,480
They would not have
partaken in of themselves.

5285
02:29:01,810 --> 02:29:02,643
Maybe they did,

5286
02:29:02,650 --> 02:29:03,170
but,

5287
02:29:03,170 --> 02:29:03,700
uh,

5288
02:29:03,700 --> 02:29:06,940
he said it was like he was
living inside of a tin box.

5289
02:29:07,420 --> 02:29:10,150
He said he was fucked
up and then totally new,

5290
02:29:10,151 --> 02:29:11,200
kind of fucked up.

5291
02:29:11,830 --> 02:29:12,611
Which makes sense.

5292
02:29:12,611 --> 02:29:14,410
If you've got this fucking devil's breath,

5293
02:29:14,440 --> 02:29:14,980
Columbia,

5294
02:29:14,980 --> 02:29:16,090
this is what's called the Colombians.

5295
02:29:16,091 --> 02:29:16,680
Devil's breath.

5296
02:29:16,680 --> 02:29:17,513
Yeah.

5297
02:29:18,250 --> 02:29:18,730
Yeah.

5298
02:29:18,730 --> 02:29:19,600
That spike.

5299
02:29:19,630 --> 02:29:20,080
Uh,

5300
02:29:20,080 --> 02:29:20,441
the,

5301
02:29:20,441 --> 02:29:21,070
uh,

5302
02:29:21,070 --> 02:29:23,680
the vice piece on that is incredible.

5303
02:29:23,681 --> 02:29:24,670
If you haven't seen it,

5304
02:29:24,671 --> 02:29:26,320
world's scariest drug.

5305
02:29:26,500 --> 02:29:26,951
Uh,

5306
02:29:26,951 --> 02:29:31,720
it's called Columbian Devil's
breath and it's on vice and vice is,

5307
02:29:31,721 --> 02:29:36,721
if you don't know the greatest online
source of fascinating documentaries,

5308
02:29:37,480 --> 02:29:38,120
expos,

5309
02:29:38,120 --> 02:29:39,750
A's interview is,

5310
02:29:39,820 --> 02:29:43,330
there's nothing better and it's
all because of this motherfucker.

5311
02:29:44,080 --> 02:29:47,550
Holla Atcha boy la.

5312
02:29:48,010 --> 02:29:48,551
But this,

5313
02:29:48,551 --> 02:29:48,790
uh,

5314
02:29:48,790 --> 02:29:49,331
Colombians,

5315
02:29:49,331 --> 02:29:52,720
devil's breath shit is fucking terrifying
because they give it to people and

5316
02:29:52,721 --> 02:29:53,890
then the people just do your bidding.

5317
02:29:53,950 --> 02:29:55,180
They have no idea.

5318
02:29:55,280 --> 02:29:56,180
It's amazing.

5319
02:29:56,630 --> 02:29:57,550
It's really amazing.

5320
02:29:57,560 --> 02:29:58,393
You watch it in,

5321
02:29:58,430 --> 02:29:59,263
in person.

5322
02:29:59,330 --> 02:29:59,900
No.

5323
02:29:59,900 --> 02:30:00,080
Uh,

5324
02:30:00,080 --> 02:30:01,310
I've seen the video,

5325
02:30:01,311 --> 02:30:02,090
I've seen the footage.

5326
02:30:02,090 --> 02:30:03,170
I didn't do the shoot,

5327
02:30:03,171 --> 02:30:03,820
but the,

5328
02:30:03,820 --> 02:30:04,160
they,

5329
02:30:04,160 --> 02:30:04,993
the,

5330
02:30:05,160 --> 02:30:09,830
a lot of how it works is prostitutes put
these nose plugs up their nose and they

5331
02:30:09,831 --> 02:30:12,890
have like a condom or a balloon with
some in it and they put in their mouth.

5332
02:30:13,310 --> 02:30:14,570
And then what they do is,

5333
02:30:14,590 --> 02:30:14,880
is,

5334
02:30:14,880 --> 02:30:16,490
is when you go close,

5335
02:30:16,491 --> 02:30:18,560
they sort of blow it into your
face and it's a ton of it.

5336
02:30:19,070 --> 02:30:19,611
And then,

5337
02:30:19,611 --> 02:30:21,230
but they have the like,

5338
02:30:21,231 --> 02:30:22,064
um,

5339
02:30:22,070 --> 02:30:27,070
a security camera footage of
like people clearing out the all,

5340
02:30:27,081 --> 02:30:31,370
they're a furniture in their house or
people going to the bank machine and just

5341
02:30:31,371 --> 02:30:32,720
taking all their money out.

5342
02:30:33,130 --> 02:30:33,963
Um,

5343
02:30:34,310 --> 02:30:36,140
and because it's auto suggestive,

5344
02:30:36,141 --> 02:30:38,420
so you're in this sort of like
trance like state and you're like,

5345
02:30:38,421 --> 02:30:39,410
now do this and you know,

5346
02:30:39,411 --> 02:30:39,801
okay,

5347
02:30:39,801 --> 02:30:42,650
and I'll take my money
out now open your door.

5348
02:30:42,890 --> 02:30:43,701
And so they,

5349
02:30:43,701 --> 02:30:44,120
you know,

5350
02:30:44,120 --> 02:30:44,321
it's,

5351
02:30:44,321 --> 02:30:44,601
it's,

5352
02:30:44,601 --> 02:30:45,434
uh,

5353
02:30:45,770 --> 02:30:48,530
apparently this I haven't verified,

5354
02:30:48,531 --> 02:30:50,690
but the Tonton Macoute the,

5355
02:30:50,691 --> 02:30:51,290
uh,

5356
02:30:51,290 --> 02:30:51,591
the,

5357
02:30:51,591 --> 02:30:52,100
um,

5358
02:30:52,100 --> 02:30:53,630
sort of a Zombie police in,

5359
02:30:53,650 --> 02:30:54,483
uh,

5360
02:30:54,530 --> 02:30:55,580
in Haiti for the,

5361
02:30:55,610 --> 02:30:56,990
for those years under Papa Doc,

5362
02:30:56,991 --> 02:30:57,360
we're like,

5363
02:30:57,360 --> 02:30:58,240
that was cupola.

5364
02:30:58,270 --> 02:30:58,521
I mean,

5365
02:30:58,521 --> 02:30:59,630
that was the Zombie drug.

5366
02:30:59,631 --> 02:31:01,250
They call the Zombie Drug Devil's breath.

5367
02:31:01,520 --> 02:31:02,840
It's got different names everywhere,

5368
02:31:02,841 --> 02:31:04,700
but it's like this auto suggestive drug.

5369
02:31:04,910 --> 02:31:07,490
What a strange side
effect or effect of his,

5370
02:31:07,530 --> 02:31:08,450
that's crazy.

5371
02:31:08,830 --> 02:31:09,400
It's crazy.

5372
02:31:09,400 --> 02:31:11,710
And this stuff is
apparently very prevalent.

5373
02:31:11,740 --> 02:31:12,011
I mean,

5374
02:31:12,011 --> 02:31:12,110
it,

5375
02:31:12,110 --> 02:31:13,540
it grows wild,

5376
02:31:13,541 --> 02:31:14,060
right?

5377
02:31:14,060 --> 02:31:14,271
Yeah.

5378
02:31:14,271 --> 02:31:14,421
Well,

5379
02:31:14,421 --> 02:31:15,200
it grows in America.

5380
02:31:15,200 --> 02:31:15,381
It's,

5381
02:31:15,381 --> 02:31:16,730
it's a sort of making,

5382
02:31:16,731 --> 02:31:19,190
it's like making a poppy into heroine.

5383
02:31:19,200 --> 02:31:19,980
It's the same sort of

5384
02:31:19,980 --> 02:31:21,720
process of making an alkaloid,

5385
02:31:21,990 --> 02:31:26,220
but it's incredible that it's the same

That's all it is.

02:31:43,171 --> 02:31:43,321
Yeah,

5402
02:31:43,321 --> 02:31:43,890

02:31:50,581 --> 02:31:51,630
maybe it's motion sickness.

5408
02:31:51,631 --> 02:31:52,171
Maybe that was it.

5409
02:31:52,171 --> 02:31:52,440
Yeah.

5410
02:31:52,440 --> 02:31:53,270
Yeah.

5413
02:31:55,021 --> 02:31:55,200
Well,

seasickness his motion sickness.

5415
02:31:56,731 --> 02:31:58,260
I'm pretty sure it's
exactly the same thing,

5416
02:31:58,530 --> 02:32:01,080
but that's amazing that it's
done devil's press shit.

5417
02:32:01,470 --> 02:32:01,651
Well,

5418
02:32:01,651 --> 02:32:02,640
according to Jimmy Kimmel,

5419
02:32:02,820 --> 02:32:05,840
do not take that with beer and we'd,

5420
02:32:06,210 --> 02:32:06,690
cause it's,

5421
02:32:06,690 --> 02:32:07,830
it's a fucking bad,

5422
02:32:07,920 --> 02:32:09,000
it's a bad ride.

5423
02:32:09,270 --> 02:32:10,860
Bad ride inside the tin can.

5424
02:32:11,010 --> 02:32:13,710
And we could've tried the
auto suggestive powers of it.

5425
02:32:14,250 --> 02:32:14,521
Yeah.

5426
02:32:14,521 --> 02:32:15,311
I wonder if that me,

5427
02:32:15,311 --> 02:32:17,550
maybe he did some terrible
things and he doesn't even know.

5428
02:32:17,990 --> 02:32:19,200
Maybe someone had him.

5429
02:32:19,410 --> 02:32:24,300
It's very strange that those two things
are are related in that I guess you

5430
02:32:24,301 --> 02:32:28,110
could just cover someone with those
patches while they're asleep to start

5431
02:32:28,111 --> 02:32:31,080
sticking them all over their body and
then they wake up and you're like,

5432
02:32:31,081 --> 02:32:31,530
bitch,

5433
02:32:31,530 --> 02:32:32,340
I own you.

5434
02:32:32,340 --> 02:32:34,050
It's time to go to the ATM.

5435
02:32:34,140 --> 02:32:34,860
It's do it.

5436
02:32:34,860 --> 02:32:35,693
Wake up.

5437
02:32:35,880 --> 02:32:37,780
I wonder if that's ever been attempted.

5438
02:32:37,830 --> 02:32:41,130
Wonder if I'm fucking up because I
suggested it and no one ever thought of it

5439
02:32:41,131 --> 02:32:41,510
before.

5440
02:32:41,510 --> 02:32:42,540
Now it's going to be a thing.

5441
02:32:43,020 --> 02:32:43,621
Somebody be out.

5442
02:32:43,621 --> 02:32:47,070
It has to be the first person you
go to the am pm covered in patches.

5443
02:32:47,790 --> 02:32:47,971
Yeah.

5444
02:32:47,971 --> 02:32:50,010
There's no way I can be
all your fucking Twizzlers.

5445
02:32:50,070 --> 02:32:50,970
I shouldn't have told people that.

5446
02:32:50,971 --> 02:32:52,560
That's the same thing I fucked up.

5447
02:32:52,990 --> 02:32:53,200
Hey,

5448
02:32:53,200 --> 02:32:54,033
what do I do now?

5449
02:32:54,240 --> 02:32:57,360
How do I get out of the tremendous
knowledge comes tremendous power and

5450
02:32:57,361 --> 02:32:58,230
responsibility.

5451
02:32:58,260 --> 02:32:58,471
Okay,

5452
02:32:58,471 --> 02:33:00,930
well what if you have almost
no knowledge but Wikipedia?

5453
02:33:02,280 --> 02:33:05,250
How much responsibilities and when
you're just Google searching shit,

5454
02:33:05,251 --> 02:33:06,900
is there a lot of on the line there?

5455
02:33:07,440 --> 02:33:08,273
How much do I owe

5456
02:33:10,360 --> 02:33:10,560
you?

5457
02:33:10,560 --> 02:33:11,393
Good.

5458
02:33:11,640 --> 02:33:11,851
Good.

5459
02:33:11,851 --> 02:33:13,950
It's going to have a great time
and give away all his money.

5460
02:33:14,700 --> 02:33:18,780
You guys went with Dennis
Rodman to fucking North Korea.

5461
02:33:19,460 --> 02:33:20,010
Um,

5462
02:33:20,010 --> 02:33:22,800
what the fuck was that?

5463
02:33:22,950 --> 02:33:26,690
Has that happening and how the fuck is
Dennis Rodman going back after home?

5464
02:33:26,691 --> 02:33:27,750
He just killed his uncle.

5465
02:33:27,930 --> 02:33:28,763
Yeah.

5466
02:33:29,010 --> 02:33:29,480
Well he's,

5467
02:33:29,480 --> 02:33:29,671
well,

5468
02:33:29,671 --> 02:33:29,971
you know,

5469
02:33:29,971 --> 02:33:30,211
look,

5470
02:33:30,211 --> 02:33:30,991
it's resurrected.

5471
02:33:30,991 --> 02:33:31,651
His career.

5472
02:33:31,651 --> 02:33:33,540
You know Dennis Rodman's has it.

5473
02:33:33,541 --> 02:33:34,374
Really?

5474
02:33:35,070 --> 02:33:35,461
What is it?

5475
02:33:35,461 --> 02:33:37,020
What kind of career does that resurrect?

5476
02:33:37,260 --> 02:33:38,550
He's a basketball player.

5477
02:33:39,550 --> 02:33:39,960
What is,

5478
02:33:39,960 --> 02:33:41,350
what is the career now dude?

5479
02:33:41,370 --> 02:33:42,810
I saw them sponsoring restaurants.

5480
02:33:42,811 --> 02:33:43,700
Barbecue restaurant.

5481
02:33:47,500 --> 02:33:48,333
Yeah,

5482
02:33:51,520 --> 02:33:52,330
totally got me,

5483
02:33:52,330 --> 02:33:53,140
dude.

5484
02:33:53,140 --> 02:33:53,351
Oh,

5485
02:33:53,351 --> 02:33:54,184
that's funny.

5486
02:33:55,240 --> 02:33:56,080
You would fucking salad

5487
02:33:59,660 --> 02:34:02,160
reading Asian stereotypes
and just fake news.

5488
02:34:02,510 --> 02:34:05,950
The idea that all of a sudden Dennis
Rodman is huge in the agent community and

5489
02:34:05,951 --> 02:34:07,050
he just fucking sell on everything.

5490
02:34:07,060 --> 02:34:08,310
They have Fox News.

5491
02:34:08,311 --> 02:34:08,551
Dude,

5492
02:34:08,551 --> 02:34:09,450
I just make shit up.

5493
02:34:09,830 --> 02:34:10,290
This it,

5494
02:34:10,290 --> 02:34:10,921
this is it.

5495
02:34:10,921 --> 02:34:12,330
And this is him in North Korea.

5496
02:34:12,780 --> 02:34:13,111
Wow.

5497
02:34:13,111 --> 02:34:15,990
That is so fucking Uber strange man.

5498
02:34:16,170 --> 02:34:16,351
Well.

5499
02:34:16,351 --> 02:34:16,621
Okay,

5500
02:34:16,621 --> 02:34:17,290
tell me,

5501
02:34:17,290 --> 02:34:18,850
this was your second time there,

5502
02:34:18,851 --> 02:34:19,330
right?

5503
02:34:19,330 --> 02:34:22,660
This is after you guys had filmed that
one piece that was exposing all the

5504
02:34:22,661 --> 02:34:25,060
weirdness about their restaurants
and all that other shit.

5505
02:34:25,090 --> 02:34:25,923
Right.

5506
02:34:26,050 --> 02:34:27,100
Same time or no,

5507
02:34:27,110 --> 02:34:27,660
no.

5508
02:34:27,660 --> 02:34:31,530
Twice and did documentaries
and because I had been there,

5509
02:34:31,531 --> 02:34:33,870
I knew that they were
crazy about a basketball,

5510
02:34:33,871 --> 02:34:35,040
but be the Chicago Bulls.

5511
02:34:35,550 --> 02:34:38,550
I can't go back because of my
previous two documentaries,

5512
02:34:39,240 --> 02:34:41,280
but we knew that they
love the Chicago Bulls.

5513
02:34:41,281 --> 02:34:44,100
So we tried to put them
together again to go do a tour.

5514
02:34:44,101 --> 02:34:49,101
But no one would except for Rodman who
is signing bay basketball cards in Denver

5515
02:34:49,201 --> 02:34:50,034
or something.

5516
02:34:50,130 --> 02:34:51,330
And so he,

5517
02:34:51,331 --> 02:34:51,581
yeah,

5518
02:34:51,581 --> 02:34:51,841
he said,

5519
02:34:51,841 --> 02:34:52,710
I'll go and,

5520
02:34:52,711 --> 02:34:53,101
and,

5521
02:34:53,101 --> 02:34:53,580
and,

5522
02:34:53,580 --> 02:34:55,800
and obviously we need
more people than just him.

5523
02:34:55,801 --> 02:34:58,350
So the globe trotters a agreed to go,

5524
02:34:58,890 --> 02:35:00,660
but we thought we didn't
know he would show up.

5525
02:35:00,661 --> 02:35:01,201
We didn't know.

5526
02:35:01,201 --> 02:35:04,440
Like we thought like this would just be
a way to get in and see some different

5527
02:35:04,441 --> 02:35:05,040
shit.

5528
02:35:05,040 --> 02:35:08,580
And then Kim Jong Goon showed
up and then not only showed up,

5529
02:35:08,581 --> 02:35:08,821
said,

5530
02:35:08,821 --> 02:35:09,031
hey,

5531
02:35:09,031 --> 02:35:10,320
come back to my house.

5532
02:35:10,560 --> 02:35:15,180
And everyone went back to his house
and got absolutely loaded and you know,

5533
02:35:15,300 --> 02:35:16,440
talk to a bunch of,

5534
02:35:16,680 --> 02:35:19,320
is he the only one that's allowed
to wear that haircut in North Korea?

5535
02:35:19,500 --> 02:35:22,080
Like what if somebody else wanted
to rock that crazy haircut that Kim,

5536
02:35:22,081 --> 02:35:23,280
Jon Owen has theirs.

5537
02:35:23,520 --> 02:35:28,520
There's actually only seven haircuts that
are allowed by the state and they have

5538
02:35:29,911 --> 02:35:32,400
to be done in a particular
way like his haircut.

5539
02:35:32,520 --> 02:35:35,490
But pause that like back then Jamie Bam,

5540
02:35:35,491 --> 02:35:36,324
look at that haircut.

5541
02:35:36,510 --> 02:35:36,631
Yeah,

5542
02:35:36,631 --> 02:35:36,781
no,

5543
02:35:36,781 --> 02:35:37,471
that would be a,

5544
02:35:37,471 --> 02:35:38,550
that would be a haircut.

5545
02:35:38,620 --> 02:35:39,180
Is that only,

5546
02:35:39,180 --> 02:35:40,170
you know what's interesting?

5547
02:35:40,190 --> 02:35:41,150
So he looks the,

5548
02:35:41,151 --> 02:35:43,750
one of the reasons why
they picked him because uh,

5549
02:35:45,230 --> 02:35:48,890
Kim Jong Il had a bunch of sons
cause he had a bunch of lovers,

5550
02:35:48,891 --> 02:35:49,221
whatever.

5551
02:35:49,221 --> 02:35:50,270
And this kid,

5552
02:35:50,271 --> 02:35:51,920
they weren't going to uh,

5553
02:35:52,130 --> 02:35:55,850
pick because he was educated in
Switzerland and that's the back of west.

5554
02:35:55,851 --> 02:35:56,660
It's about,

5555
02:35:56,660 --> 02:35:59,960
but he had an older son who
was picked up in like a Tokyo,

5556
02:35:59,961 --> 02:36:00,780
which is an a,

5557
02:36:00,780 --> 02:36:01,820
you just can't do that.

5558
02:36:02,090 --> 02:36:05,850
And another son that smashed
a Ferrari and like Monaco and,

5559
02:36:05,851 --> 02:36:06,441
and you know,

5560
02:36:06,441 --> 02:36:09,290
in the poorest country in the world
and they're fucking smashing Ferrari's

5561
02:36:09,291 --> 02:36:10,124
Monaco.

5562
02:36:10,210 --> 02:36:10,580
But he,

5563
02:36:10,580 --> 02:36:10,700
the,

5564
02:36:10,700 --> 02:36:15,700
one of the reasons why he got in is
because he looks exactly like his

5565
02:36:16,191 --> 02:36:17,150
grandfather,

5566
02:36:18,410 --> 02:36:19,550
Kim Il Sung,

5567
02:36:19,910 --> 02:36:21,530
who was the founder.

5568
02:36:21,531 --> 02:36:22,230
Like he was the,

5569
02:36:22,230 --> 02:36:23,150
the first of the,

5570
02:36:23,151 --> 02:36:26,660
he was drained by the Soviets and then
he came down and he started the whole,

5571
02:36:26,661 --> 02:36:26,901
uh,

5572
02:36:26,901 --> 02:36:27,321
you know,

5573
02:36:27,321 --> 02:36:29,420
a cult of personality.

5574
02:36:30,680 --> 02:36:31,281
The original,

5575
02:36:31,281 --> 02:36:32,114
the original,

5576
02:36:32,330 --> 02:36:33,350
the original cumulus song.

5577
02:36:33,560 --> 02:36:37,310
And he looked so much
like him that it's like,

5578
02:36:37,311 --> 02:36:39,980
it's like me being born looking
exactly like Abe Lincoln.

5579
02:36:39,981 --> 02:36:40,681
They're just like this,

5580
02:36:40,681 --> 02:36:41,241
but he's the,

5581
02:36:41,241 --> 02:36:43,120
just put them up there and so that,

5582
02:36:43,121 --> 02:36:44,920
that's why they put them
up there and now he's,

5583
02:36:44,921 --> 02:36:46,700
he's now he's purging
the shit out of people.

5584
02:36:46,910 --> 02:36:48,890
It's probably not him purging
the shit out of people.

5585
02:36:48,891 --> 02:36:53,280
It's the generals behind him getting
rid of the other generals that oppose.

5586
02:36:53,590 --> 02:36:56,950
So these are the generals that were
loyal to the previous administration,

5587
02:36:56,951 --> 02:36:58,360
his father's administration,

5588
02:36:58,361 --> 02:36:59,320
and they've criticized him.

5589
02:36:59,321 --> 02:37:00,154
Is that what it is?

5590
02:37:00,760 --> 02:37:01,121
No,

5591
02:37:01,121 --> 02:37:02,590
I think the uncle,

5592
02:37:02,591 --> 02:37:05,470
it has his own power sort of thing.

5593
02:37:05,471 --> 02:37:06,304
And so,

5594
02:37:09,910 --> 02:37:10,770
oh no.

5595
02:37:10,771 --> 02:37:12,460
So this is them getting rid of,

5596
02:37:12,580 --> 02:37:13,413
you know the,

5597
02:37:13,500 --> 02:37:13,900
the,

5598
02:37:13,900 --> 02:37:16,190
the dowager sorta uncle talked

5599
02:37:16,190 --> 02:37:16,701
a little too much.

5600
02:37:16,701 --> 02:37:17,031
Shit.

5601
02:37:17,031 --> 02:37:18,040
Got a little too conti.

5602
02:37:18,300 --> 02:37:19,920
Disrespectful gold.

5603
02:37:20,000 --> 02:37:21,480
This was perfectly yourself.

5604
02:37:21,560 --> 02:37:24,050
Go a little out of line yourself.

5605
02:37:26,070 --> 02:37:27,360
Let alone yourself.

5606
02:37:27,520 --> 02:37:28,490
I remember the scene.

5607
02:37:29,210 --> 02:37:33,920
Fucking Joe Pesci kills the guy got a
little out of and stuff and Robert De Niro

5608
02:37:33,921 --> 02:37:35,030
and him stopped the guy to death.

5609
02:37:35,120 --> 02:37:35,690
Yes.

5610
02:37:35,690 --> 02:37:35,860
Kate,

5611
02:37:35,860 --> 02:37:36,411
you shine box.

5612
02:37:36,411 --> 02:37:37,880
Remember that Guy Billy Bathgate?

5613
02:37:38,480 --> 02:37:38,750
Yup.

5614
02:37:38,750 --> 02:37:39,610
Billy battery go.

5615
02:37:39,720 --> 02:37:40,553
Yeah.

5616
02:37:40,820 --> 02:37:42,320
So he killed the fire.

5617
02:37:42,340 --> 02:37:47,000
They killed the uncle and
then hired though the wife
of the uncle gave her a new

5618
02:37:47,001 --> 02:37:47,834
position.

5619
02:37:48,320 --> 02:37:48,920
Yeah.

5620
02:37:48,920 --> 02:37:52,960
Although I read something recently
about the wife that now that's she,

5621
02:37:52,970 --> 02:37:55,940
she's been detained or you know,

5622
02:37:55,970 --> 02:37:56,803
something.

5623
02:37:57,460 --> 02:37:58,970
I didn't see that something's happening.

5624
02:37:59,160 --> 02:37:59,401
Well,

5625
02:37:59,401 --> 02:38:01,230
I had also read that maybe the wife had a,

5626
02:38:01,231 --> 02:38:02,200
played a part in it,

5627
02:38:02,430 --> 02:38:03,660
that she was trying to get rid of him.

5628
02:38:03,970 --> 02:38:04,521
He was a fucking,

5629
02:38:04,521 --> 02:38:07,380
he was tired of her husband trying
to stick it in her butt or something.

5630
02:38:08,120 --> 02:38:08,430
I mean,

5631
02:38:08,430 --> 02:38:12,410
Kerry gave like a crazy interview about
it to where he was just opened the

5632
02:38:12,740 --> 02:38:16,730
talking about how he's
killing off people and,

5633
02:38:16,731 --> 02:38:18,620
and how it's making him nervous.

5634
02:38:18,621 --> 02:38:21,440
And it was interesting
to see a diplomat just go

5635
02:38:21,750 --> 02:38:22,890
balls to the wall with it.

5636
02:38:22,891 --> 02:38:23,131
I was like,

5637
02:38:23,131 --> 02:38:23,310
well,

5638
02:38:23,310 --> 02:38:27,660
remember when Carrie was like fucking
sounding the war horns for Syria and the

5639
02:38:27,661 --> 02:38:28,470
entire government,

5640
02:38:28,470 --> 02:38:29,610
the entire country was like,

5641
02:38:29,640 --> 02:38:30,473
um,

5642
02:38:30,870 --> 02:38:31,703
no,

5643
02:38:31,710 --> 02:38:32,640
like no one,

5644
02:38:32,670 --> 02:38:33,810
not Fox News,

5645
02:38:33,811 --> 02:38:34,860
not CNN,

5646
02:38:34,861 --> 02:38:36,630
not fucking anybody was like,

5647
02:38:36,660 --> 02:38:39,240
this is a good move for America.

5648
02:38:39,480 --> 02:38:40,710
We need to go to war was here.

5649
02:38:40,860 --> 02:38:41,491
Everybody was like,

5650
02:38:41,491 --> 02:38:41,731
Whoa,

5651
02:38:41,731 --> 02:38:41,941
Whoa,

5652
02:38:41,941 --> 02:38:42,180
whoa.

5653
02:38:42,180 --> 02:38:45,060
We need to go with a Russian Syria,

5654
02:38:45,920 --> 02:38:46,980
Russia on one side,

5655
02:38:46,981 --> 02:38:47,450
us on there.

5656
02:38:47,450 --> 02:38:47,611
Well,

5657
02:38:47,611 --> 02:38:48,720
we've seen where this ends up.

5658
02:38:48,860 --> 02:38:52,460
Is that one of the first times you've
seen in your lifetime where the United

5659
02:38:52,460 --> 02:38:52,790
States,

5660
02:38:52,790 --> 02:38:54,680
the people literally said,

5661
02:38:54,710 --> 02:38:55,580
fuck this.

5662
02:38:55,700 --> 02:38:56,870
And the government backed off.

5663
02:38:57,010 --> 02:38:57,251
Well,

5664
02:38:57,251 --> 02:38:57,761
for sure.

5665
02:38:57,761 --> 02:39:02,200
And it was such a black eye
because actually Putin said,

5666
02:39:02,230 --> 02:39:02,441
oh,

5667
02:39:02,441 --> 02:39:02,861
I'll,

5668
02:39:02,861 --> 02:39:07,000
I'll negotiate this plank because they're
backing Assad and we were going to

5669
02:39:07,001 --> 02:39:07,890
back the other side.

5670
02:39:07,891 --> 02:39:09,580
So it's a cold war fight again.

5671
02:39:10,030 --> 02:39:14,440
And Putin comes up with a peace plan
and we were so embarrassed that we went,

5672
02:39:14,530 --> 02:39:14,771
yeah,

5673
02:39:14,771 --> 02:39:15,011
okay,

5674
02:39:15,011 --> 02:39:16,030
we'll take your peace plan.

5675
02:39:16,210 --> 02:39:19,240
We'll take rush this bs plan
who we were about to go to war.

5676
02:39:19,370 --> 02:39:20,570
He seems so reasonable.

5677
02:39:20,571 --> 02:39:20,781
And the,

5678
02:39:20,781 --> 02:39:21,740
and the peace plan too,

5679
02:39:21,741 --> 02:39:21,981
it's like,

5680
02:39:21,981 --> 02:39:22,150
yeah,

5681
02:39:22,150 --> 02:39:24,370
get that guy who essentially the,

5682
02:39:24,371 --> 02:39:27,540
the czar of Russia is more reasonable.

5683
02:39:27,770 --> 02:39:28,270
Yeah.

5684
02:39:28,270 --> 02:39:29,740
Well you just got back from there.

5685
02:39:30,190 --> 02:39:32,440
One of the most unfriendly.

5686
02:39:32,441 --> 02:39:34,690
It has to be unfriendly and anti American.

5687
02:39:34,870 --> 02:39:38,440
Like what's interesting is that you
would think that the cold war never ended

5688
02:39:38,750 --> 02:39:43,750
because you go there and the anti American
anti-western rhetoric is crazy and

5689
02:39:44,021 --> 02:39:44,854
they blame everything.

5690
02:39:44,860 --> 02:39:48,910
Russia's economic problems that the
American's fucking financial crisis,

5691
02:39:49,090 --> 02:39:49,870
you know this thing.

5692
02:39:49,870 --> 02:39:52,270
Well that's the American spending
too much on the arms race.

5693
02:39:52,450 --> 02:39:52,601
Oh,

5694
02:39:52,601 --> 02:39:54,250
the problem with the
gas going into Europe.

5695
02:39:54,370 --> 02:39:57,370
That's the American's flooding the
shit with all their fucking gas and the

5696
02:39:57,371 --> 02:39:58,870
racism's over over.

5697
02:39:58,940 --> 02:39:59,773
Yeah.

5698
02:40:00,780 --> 02:40:02,260
When was the last time you went to Russia?

5699
02:40:03,460 --> 02:40:06,310
I was there three months ago.

5700
02:40:08,320 --> 02:40:10,900
I was probably there right
before you were there.

5701
02:40:11,200 --> 02:40:12,033
And um,

5702
02:40:12,190 --> 02:40:12,371
no,

5703
02:40:12,371 --> 02:40:14,160
it was not a happy

5704
02:40:14,160 --> 02:40:14,820
place.

5705
02:40:14,820 --> 02:40:16,470
You get off there you go on the train.

5706
02:40:16,471 --> 02:40:17,610
I took the train around there,

5707
02:40:18,180 --> 02:40:18,421
man.

5708
02:40:18,421 --> 02:40:18,780
It's a,

5709
02:40:18,780 --> 02:40:20,190
it's a depressing place.

5710
02:40:20,780 --> 02:40:21,570
It's pretty sad.

5711
02:40:21,570 --> 02:40:23,190
What am I went there to film a film,

5712
02:40:23,250 --> 02:40:23,581
film,

5713
02:40:23,581 --> 02:40:23,900
film,

5714
02:40:23,900 --> 02:40:24,191
film,

5715
02:40:24,191 --> 02:40:26,040
a movie and he got hit in
the face of the metal pipe.

5716
02:40:26,690 --> 02:40:28,920
They hit him in the
teeth with a metal pipe,

5717
02:40:29,160 --> 02:40:30,400
smashed all the CT,

5718
02:40:30,410 --> 02:40:32,700
woke up with a mouth full
of blood and broken teeth.

5719
02:40:32,850 --> 02:40:34,440
All of his mind's messing shoes.

5720
02:40:35,520 --> 02:40:36,690
He doesn't know who the fuck it was.

5721
02:40:36,900 --> 02:40:40,170
He turned the corner and someone
just fucking faced him with a pipe.

5722
02:40:40,410 --> 02:40:41,680
It's a violent place.

5723
02:40:41,690 --> 02:40:42,061
Cops,

5724
02:40:42,061 --> 02:40:45,120
cops shake people down there
on the regular civilians.

5725
02:40:45,121 --> 02:40:46,080
The cops will shake them down.

5726
02:40:46,140 --> 02:40:46,651
Yeah,

5727
02:40:46,651 --> 02:40:47,011
man,

5728
02:40:47,011 --> 02:40:48,090
that's a dark place.

5729
02:40:48,360 --> 02:40:50,910
That's a dark place that's
lost a lot of its sons as well.

5730
02:40:50,911 --> 02:40:53,730
You a lot of beautiful women
there that are growing up hard.

5731
02:40:54,390 --> 02:40:55,910
A lot of liver stealers.

5732
02:40:56,090 --> 02:40:56,923
You know what I'm saying?

5733
02:40:57,240 --> 02:40:58,440
Wake up with stitches.

5734
02:40:58,880 --> 02:40:59,671
All groggy.

5735
02:40:59,671 --> 02:41:01,050
Connected to an ivy.

5736
02:41:01,260 --> 02:41:02,093
Yeah.

5737
02:41:02,160 --> 02:41:02,281
No,

5738
02:41:02,281 --> 02:41:03,750
you get that feeling out there man.

5739
02:41:03,751 --> 02:41:04,740
Like as an American,

5740
02:41:04,741 --> 02:41:05,191
it's not a,

5741
02:41:05,191 --> 02:41:06,120
it's not a friendly place.

5742
02:41:06,300 --> 02:41:07,420
Hostel Type Shit.

5743
02:41:07,421 --> 02:41:08,800
Hostile as in hostile,

5744
02:41:08,850 --> 02:41:10,870
the fucking movie where
they steal your liver.

5745
02:41:11,480 --> 02:41:12,313
I don't want that.

5746
02:41:12,580 --> 02:41:14,500
Or they just tortured people
and killed them or something.

5747
02:41:15,010 --> 02:41:15,400
Yeah,

5748
02:41:15,400 --> 02:41:16,420
it seems hostile,

5749
02:41:16,570 --> 02:41:20,140
which is why it's so scary to think
about going to war with a hardened people

5750
02:41:20,141 --> 02:41:23,380
that were controlled by the
Mongols for over 200 years.

5751
02:41:23,650 --> 02:41:24,820
The Mongols came,

5752
02:41:24,940 --> 02:41:26,380
I mean everybody tried to conquer Russia.

5753
02:41:26,381 --> 02:41:30,640
Napoleon lost 60% of his troops trying
and the Mongols came in there in the

5754
02:41:30,641 --> 02:41:31,600
winter.

5755
02:41:31,900 --> 02:41:35,530
They came in in the winter and fucked
everybody up and just dominated the whole

5756
02:41:35,531 --> 02:41:36,820
country for a couple hundred years.

5757
02:41:37,410 --> 02:41:37,651
Yeah,

5758
02:41:37,651 --> 02:41:37,981
dude,

5759
02:41:37,981 --> 02:41:38,460
Mongolia,

5760
02:41:38,460 --> 02:41:42,240
Mongolia is the most magical
place I have been this year.

5761
02:41:43,230 --> 02:41:44,063
Magical.

5762
02:41:44,130 --> 02:41:44,963
It's,

5763
02:41:45,090 --> 02:41:48,450
it's very cool because there are
parts of it that remain untouched.

5764
02:41:48,780 --> 02:41:49,890
You walked far enough,

5765
02:41:49,891 --> 02:41:51,870
you drive far enough into the desert.

5766
02:41:52,290 --> 02:41:53,520
There are places where just like,

5767
02:41:53,521 --> 02:41:53,761
man,

5768
02:41:53,761 --> 02:41:55,140
I feel like original man,

5769
02:41:55,770 --> 02:41:58,530
well these people don't
know the size of the step,

5770
02:41:58,780 --> 02:42:00,750
the size of the steps of Mongolia.

5771
02:42:00,810 --> 02:42:02,070
The step meaning the,

5772
02:42:02,071 --> 02:42:03,960
it's the area of like sort of like a,

5773
02:42:03,961 --> 02:42:08,961
an an ocean with all the water taken out
of it is twice as big as the Atlantic

5774
02:42:10,560 --> 02:42:11,040
Ocean,

5775
02:42:11,040 --> 02:42:16,040
twice as wide as the Atlantic Ocean and
it's just this flat plane and that's

5776
02:42:16,111 --> 02:42:18,150
where we're Gingiss Khan was Bert,

5777
02:42:18,230 --> 02:42:19,530
you ever see the movie Mongol?

5778
02:42:19,590 --> 02:42:20,423
Yeah.

5779
02:42:20,440 --> 02:42:21,273
Yeah.

5780
02:42:21,340 --> 02:42:22,091
It's a good movie.

5781
02:42:22,091 --> 02:42:23,030
But the funny thing is,

5782
02:42:23,080 --> 02:42:23,740
well not funny.

5783
02:42:23,740 --> 02:42:25,210
Mongolians don't like that move.

5784
02:42:25,211 --> 02:42:25,780
Really?

5785
02:42:25,780 --> 02:42:26,080
Yeah,

5786
02:42:26,080 --> 02:42:28,330
there's another gang is
con movie coming out,

5787
02:42:28,331 --> 02:42:32,600
but they feel like they weren't
depicted properly in the movie mom.

5788
02:42:32,930 --> 02:42:33,830
Well they should be happy.

5789
02:42:33,831 --> 02:42:36,350
They got John Wayne to play
gangs con the original,

5790
02:42:36,670 --> 02:42:38,540
cause he fucking knocked
it out of the park.

5791
02:42:38,570 --> 02:42:42,520
That shit was authentic is fuck you ever
see John Wayne and Kingus Khan and one

5792
02:42:42,521 --> 02:42:47,030
of the worst pieces of American
film or culture period.

5793
02:42:47,270 --> 02:42:49,430
It's dark diggity dog shit sounds bad.

5794
02:42:49,460 --> 02:42:51,140
The best thing on the Mongols,

5795
02:42:51,141 --> 02:42:51,950
without a doubt,

5796
02:42:51,950 --> 02:42:52,850
I say this all the time,

5797
02:42:52,851 --> 02:42:53,684
but if you haven't heard it,

5798
02:42:53,780 --> 02:42:55,460
Dan Carlin's hardcore history,

5799
02:42:55,670 --> 02:42:57,050
wrath of the con.

5800
02:42:57,260 --> 02:42:59,060
It's a five part series,

5801
02:42:59,061 --> 02:43:04,061
five two plus hour long podcast on
the Mongols and it's fucking magical.

5802
02:43:05,480 --> 02:43:06,710
It's amazing.

5803
02:43:06,860 --> 02:43:09,470
Just the sheer numbers
that he drops on you.

5804
02:43:09,680 --> 02:43:12,520
The Mongols killed many fucking people.

5805
02:43:12,521 --> 02:43:16,660
They killed 11% of the entire
population of the earth.

5806
02:43:16,750 --> 02:43:17,583
Wow.

5807
02:43:17,740 --> 02:43:18,340
Yeah.

5808
02:43:18,340 --> 02:43:21,520
One out of every 500 dudes in
China is related to gangs con.

5809
02:43:21,540 --> 02:43:21,890
Wow.

5810
02:43:21,890 --> 02:43:22,210
Yeah.

5811
02:43:22,210 --> 02:43:22,970
Directly.

5812
02:43:22,970 --> 02:43:25,010
I did that DNA online.

5813
02:43:25,040 --> 02:43:29,090
My brother did the DNA online test and
like we have DNA from there obviously.

5814
02:43:29,091 --> 02:43:29,450
Damn,

5815
02:43:29,450 --> 02:43:30,440
you got conned DNA.

5816
02:43:32,240 --> 02:43:36,530
What they'll say is your DNA comes from
this region and like it was Mongolia or

5817
02:43:36,531 --> 02:43:37,070
Korea,

5818
02:43:37,070 --> 02:43:37,401
you know,

5819
02:43:37,401 --> 02:43:37,620
so.

5820
02:43:37,620 --> 02:43:38,060
Right.

5821
02:43:38,060 --> 02:43:39,620
The interesting thing though is this,

5822
02:43:39,860 --> 02:43:41,360
when you go to an old country,

5823
02:43:41,361 --> 02:43:45,790
an old culture like Mongolian culture it,

5824
02:43:45,791 --> 02:43:47,480
the wisdom has been passed down.

5825
02:43:47,481 --> 02:43:48,590
Like you see these things,

5826
02:43:48,591 --> 02:43:50,980
people have this like
patients about them and they,

5827
02:43:51,560 --> 02:43:54,190
I was in the desert and I was
talking to these people is booked,

5828
02:43:54,191 --> 02:43:55,310
the minds are coming,

5829
02:43:55,550 --> 02:43:57,380
the mines are threatening
your way of life.

5830
02:43:57,420 --> 02:44:01,250
Are you worried that like there will
be no nomads in the next generation?

5831
02:44:01,251 --> 02:44:01,670
And they're like,

5832
02:44:01,670 --> 02:44:02,503
yeah,

5833
02:44:02,690 --> 02:44:03,860
we're worried about it.

5834
02:44:03,861 --> 02:44:04,130
We,

5835
02:44:04,130 --> 02:44:07,070
we know that like this way of
life is going by the wayside,

5836
02:44:07,071 --> 02:44:08,480
but we've persevered.

5837
02:44:08,840 --> 02:44:09,770
We've been through a lot.

5838
02:44:10,070 --> 02:44:13,310
We've seen a lot of things like our
people have always persevered and it's

5839
02:44:13,311 --> 02:44:14,420
interesting too,

5840
02:44:14,690 --> 02:44:18,410
they have this confidence in that
because it's such an old culture,

5841
02:44:18,790 --> 02:44:21,340
it's such an old culture
and at one point in time,

5842
02:44:21,341 --> 02:44:22,990
such an incredibly dominant culture.

5843
02:44:23,030 --> 02:44:23,980
Very proud of it.

5844
02:44:24,040 --> 02:44:24,873
They're really,

5845
02:44:25,000 --> 02:44:26,170
they have gang is counting their money.

5846
02:44:26,440 --> 02:44:26,820
Yeah.

5847
02:44:26,820 --> 02:44:29,200
This is the guy killed in his lifetime.

5848
02:44:29,440 --> 02:44:32,620
Five zero million,

5849
02:44:32,830 --> 02:44:37,830
right between the low numbers are
20 the high number is like 70 wow.

5850
02:44:38,590 --> 02:44:43,590
And a lot of people say somewhere between
40 and 50 million people with horses

5851
02:44:45,430 --> 02:44:46,960
and bows and arrows,

5852
02:44:46,990 --> 02:44:48,340
they killed everybody.

5853
02:44:48,370 --> 02:44:50,830
It's unbelievable.

5854
02:44:50,831 --> 02:44:52,690
How much damage this one guy,

5855
02:44:52,691 --> 02:44:54,250
this is John Wayne is gang Chi.

5856
02:44:54,460 --> 02:44:56,860
You got to hear him talk
because it's goofy as fuck.

5857
02:45:01,970 --> 02:45:02,803
Oh

5858
02:45:08,300 --> 02:45:08,700
really?

5859
02:45:08,700 --> 02:45:09,860
Your night with me?

5860
02:45:11,630 --> 02:45:13,820
He didn't even try to
have a correct accent.

5861
02:45:13,880 --> 02:45:14,270
No.

5862
02:45:14,270 --> 02:45:15,051
Nor did he do.

5863
02:45:15,051 --> 02:45:15,861
What would they always do?

5864
02:45:15,861 --> 02:45:18,170
And movies where they're
speaking a language that
nobody else speaks where they

5865
02:45:18,171 --> 02:45:19,220
go with a British accent.

5866
02:45:19,260 --> 02:45:19,570
Right.

5867
02:45:19,570 --> 02:45:20,510
Was just always a good move.

5868
02:45:20,980 --> 02:45:21,141
I mean,

5869
02:45:21,141 --> 02:45:21,831
he looked like he,

5870
02:45:21,831 --> 02:45:22,664
man,

5871
02:45:22,790 --> 02:45:25,040
that shit was terrible that she was like,

5872
02:45:25,041 --> 02:45:26,940
the rifle man goes to Mongol.

5873
02:45:29,660 --> 02:45:31,790
He's fucking stupid old movies man.

5874
02:45:31,910 --> 02:45:36,830
It's like a James Bond where he has to
become Japanese to get on the island.

5875
02:45:36,990 --> 02:45:37,490
Yeah.

5876
02:45:37,490 --> 02:45:39,140
And it's just like so
bad and they're all like,

5877
02:45:39,141 --> 02:45:39,440
Yep,

5878
02:45:39,440 --> 02:45:40,170
he's Jeff,

5879
02:45:40,170 --> 02:45:41,003
uh,

5880
02:45:41,300 --> 02:45:42,133
Tom Cruise.

5881
02:45:42,820 --> 02:45:44,320
Why that stuff is just goofy.

5882
02:45:44,360 --> 02:45:46,250
Molly's Tom Cruise played a white guy,

5883
02:45:47,000 --> 02:45:47,630
white guy,

5884
02:45:47,630 --> 02:45:49,490
but still I was like,

5885
02:45:49,491 --> 02:45:49,761
man,

5886
02:45:49,761 --> 02:45:50,520
it's the last song.

5887
02:45:50,520 --> 02:45:50,811
Ryan,

5888
02:45:50,811 --> 02:45:52,850
the last guy that lives
is Tom fucking food.

5889
02:45:53,670 --> 02:45:54,800
It has to be a white guy.

5890
02:45:54,801 --> 02:45:55,910
I was going to be the last one.

5891
02:45:56,000 --> 02:45:56,833
Well,

5892
02:45:57,610 --> 02:46:00,950
he's not just a white guy.

5893
02:46:00,951 --> 02:46:03,530
He's got more alien in
him than anybody else.

5894
02:46:03,560 --> 02:46:04,221
Not only that,

5895
02:46:04,221 --> 02:46:05,240
if there's an accident,

5896
02:46:05,270 --> 02:46:08,570
he has to stop because only he
knows what to do because he's a,

5897
02:46:09,600 --> 02:46:10,040
you're just

5898
02:46:10,040 --> 02:46:10,590
an sp.

5899
02:46:10,590 --> 02:46:11,720
Have you ever seen that speech?

5900
02:46:11,740 --> 02:46:12,090
No.

5901
02:46:12,090 --> 02:46:12,260
Well,

5902
02:46:12,260 --> 02:46:13,350
he gives in front of the science.

5903
02:46:13,460 --> 02:46:15,710
It's fucking beautiful.

5904
02:46:15,800 --> 02:46:16,101
He's,

5905
02:46:16,101 --> 02:46:19,550
it's a Scientology recruitment speech
and he's talking about as when you're a

5906
02:46:19,551 --> 02:46:20,510
Scientologists,

5907
02:46:20,511 --> 02:46:24,560
like you know that if you pass by an
accident and you're the one who needs to

5908
02:46:24,561 --> 02:46:24,921
stop,

5909
02:46:24,921 --> 02:46:25,550
you need your,

5910
02:46:25,550 --> 02:46:26,301
you're positive.

5911
02:46:26,301 --> 02:46:26,541
You're,

5912
02:46:26,541 --> 02:46:29,680
you've got that fucking
Scientology energy worker for you.

5913
02:46:29,681 --> 02:46:31,520
You got to get everyone else's an sp,

5914
02:46:31,521 --> 02:46:32,570
so you've got to get in.

5915
02:46:32,571 --> 02:46:33,470
What's an sp again?

5916
02:46:33,710 --> 02:46:35,210
Suppressive personality.

5917
02:46:35,240 --> 02:46:35,691
That's me,

5918
02:46:35,691 --> 02:46:36,524
dawg.

5919
02:46:36,740 --> 02:46:37,850
I'm all about suppressing.

5920
02:46:38,970 --> 02:46:39,950
Can't just let it go.

5921
02:46:40,330 --> 02:46:41,090
Can't just let it loose.

5922
02:46:41,090 --> 02:46:43,330
I've got feelings in me that
you don't even fucking know.

5923
02:46:44,630 --> 02:46:45,530
Does everybody have a seat?

5924
02:46:45,531 --> 02:46:47,350
And in the merchants I have a lock.

5925
02:46:47,450 --> 02:46:48,230
This is look at is,

5926
02:46:48,230 --> 02:46:48,681
first of all,

5927
02:46:48,681 --> 02:46:49,501
he won the Olympics.

5928
02:46:49,501 --> 02:46:53,390
Come off my feet and they
gave him a gold medal.

5929
02:46:53,391 --> 02:46:56,780
He won the Olympics of the world and
he's standing in front of this gigantic

5930
02:46:56,960 --> 02:46:59,180
thing that's right out of a fucking movie,

5931
02:46:59,181 --> 02:47:00,440
like a Lex Luthor thing.

5932
02:47:00,470 --> 02:47:03,020
I find them to be browsing right there.

5933
02:47:03,050 --> 02:47:03,591
He's impressive.

5934
02:47:03,591 --> 02:47:05,140
He's impressive presence.

5935
02:47:05,970 --> 02:47:06,803
Okay.

5936
02:47:07,050 --> 02:47:09,150
These are the times we will all remember,

5937
02:47:10,740 --> 02:47:11,700
were you there?

5938
02:47:12,960 --> 02:47:13,793
What did you do?

5939
02:47:15,840 --> 02:47:17,670
I think you know that I am there for you.

5940
02:47:19,740 --> 02:47:22,050
And I do care so very,

5941
02:47:22,440 --> 02:47:23,160
very,

5942
02:47:23,160 --> 02:47:24,330
very much

5943
02:47:26,910 --> 02:47:27,061
so.

5944
02:47:27,061 --> 02:47:27,461
What do you say,

5945
02:47:27,461 --> 02:47:28,500
I'm going to clean this place up.

5946
02:47:28,760 --> 02:47:29,593
Oh,

5947
02:47:30,730 --> 02:47:31,563
she's talking about earth.

5948
02:47:33,020 --> 02:47:34,260
Are you going to go out there in the ocean

5949
02:47:37,160 --> 02:47:41,820
machine with Tom Dweller
writes to Lrh l Ron Hubbard,

5950
02:47:42,210 --> 02:47:45,030
a man who was a terrible
science fiction writer

5951
02:47:45,480 --> 02:47:49,290
who was quoted as saying that if
you really want to control things,

5952
02:47:49,291 --> 02:47:50,124
start your own religion.

5953
02:47:50,130 --> 02:47:50,431
Okay,

5954
02:47:50,431 --> 02:47:51,870
so mister debunker,

5955
02:47:52,320 --> 02:47:53,890
Mr Debunker who me?

5956
02:47:54,110 --> 02:47:54,600
Yeah.

5957
02:47:54,600 --> 02:47:55,260
Does that mean,

5958
02:47:55,260 --> 02:48:00,260
is it true that Scientology was started
as a bet to see who could do the best

5959
02:48:03,630 --> 02:48:04,230
cult?

5960
02:48:04,230 --> 02:48:05,190
That is the rumor,

5961
02:48:05,310 --> 02:48:07,170
but I think it's essentially the hearsay.

5962
02:48:07,380 --> 02:48:08,213
It's hearsay.

5963
02:48:08,310 --> 02:48:09,840
Well obviously he started it.

5964
02:48:09,920 --> 02:48:11,160
Obviously he created it.

5965
02:48:11,161 --> 02:48:11,911
I mean there's no,

5966
02:48:11,911 --> 02:48:12,900
there's no getting around that.

5967
02:48:13,050 --> 02:48:13,940
When you watch the bed,

5968
02:48:13,980 --> 02:48:15,060
if you want to know what the,

5969
02:48:15,061 --> 02:48:19,020
the actual history of Scientology is
there look no further than the south park

5970
02:48:19,080 --> 02:48:24,080
episode because the South Park does it
massive justice and they keep saying this

5971
02:48:24,091 --> 02:48:25,200
is the actual work.

5972
02:48:25,230 --> 02:48:27,300
Like they show you what they,

5973
02:48:27,301 --> 02:48:28,710
this is what they actually believe.

5974
02:48:29,250 --> 02:48:30,480
They also do that for Mormons.

5975
02:48:30,481 --> 02:48:32,070
And that's beautiful as well.

5976
02:48:32,430 --> 02:48:33,263
Um,

5977
02:48:33,650 --> 02:48:34,660
what I mean it's,

5978
02:48:34,680 --> 02:48:35,010
it's,

5979
02:48:35,010 --> 02:48:36,390
it's terrible science fiction.

5980
02:48:36,570 --> 02:48:37,470
It's just like battlefield,

5981
02:48:37,471 --> 02:48:37,681
earth.

5982
02:48:37,681 --> 02:48:41,490
It's like that movie that they made
it the Travolta movie magically bad.

5983
02:48:41,520 --> 02:48:42,091
So good.

5984
02:48:42,091 --> 02:48:45,030
And it was magic leap.

5985
02:48:45,050 --> 02:48:48,300
I think you put like 80 million
of his own money and to make it,

5986
02:48:50,520 --> 02:48:50,881
first of all,

5987
02:48:50,881 --> 02:48:52,800
how did you get 80000002nd wall?

5988
02:48:52,860 --> 02:48:55,560
That's a bad investment because
the fucking movies dog shit,

5989
02:48:55,561 --> 02:48:55,691
it's,

5990
02:48:55,691 --> 02:48:55,940
it's,

5991
02:48:55,940 --> 02:48:56,251
it's,

5992
02:48:56,251 --> 02:48:56,911
but it's good.

5993
02:48:56,911 --> 02:48:57,361
It's no,

5994
02:48:57,361 --> 02:48:58,021
it's so bad.

5995
02:48:58,021 --> 02:48:58,410
It's good.

5996
02:48:58,410 --> 02:49:02,400
You need to just get really fucked up on
an edible and sit through showgirls and

5997
02:49:02,401 --> 02:49:06,630
then when the edible really kicks into
a strong peak and you're really worried

5998
02:49:06,631 --> 02:49:07,260
about the,

5999
02:49:07,260 --> 02:49:07,920
of your,

6000
02:49:07,920 --> 02:49:08,070
of

6001
02:49:08,070 --> 02:49:08,350
your,

6002
02:49:08,350 --> 02:49:08,520
uh,

6003
02:49:08,520 --> 02:49:10,290
all your friends and the earth itself,

6004
02:49:10,350 --> 02:49:13,110
that's when you put on
battlefield or you know,

6005
02:49:13,111 --> 02:49:13,871
we're all going to be okay.

6006
02:49:13,871 --> 02:49:15,330
You're going to be fine by
the time it's coming off,

6007
02:49:15,331 --> 02:49:15,570
you're like,

6008
02:49:15,570 --> 02:49:15,721
oh,

6009
02:49:15,721 --> 02:49:19,860
this is now I know where you're
positivism comes from mockery.

6010
02:49:22,480 --> 02:49:23,313
God Damn.

6011
02:49:23,370 --> 02:49:24,090
Um,

6012
02:49:24,090 --> 02:49:24,870
we're out of time.

6013
02:49:24,870 --> 02:49:25,860
And that was awesome.

6014
02:49:25,920 --> 02:49:26,550
As usual.

6015
02:49:26,550 --> 02:49:28,250
You guys are the Shit we've
got to do this together.

6016
02:49:28,790 --> 02:49:29,300

6017
02:49:29,300 --> 02:49:30,133
is this your idea?

6018
02:49:30,700 --> 02:49:30,930
Oh,

6019
02:49:30,930 --> 02:49:31,763
it was my idea.

6020
02:49:31,890 --> 02:49:32,880
Whoever's idea was,

6021
02:49:32,881 --> 02:49:33,540
it was brilliant.

6022
02:49:33,540 --> 02:49:35,070
It was such a fucking perfect idea.

6023
02:49:35,510 --> 02:49:37,450
Three favorite men's might.

6024
02:49:37,500 --> 02:49:37,621
Well,

6025

But why 30 cause turn 30 just turned 30.

6036
02:49:52,620 --> 02:49:53,071
