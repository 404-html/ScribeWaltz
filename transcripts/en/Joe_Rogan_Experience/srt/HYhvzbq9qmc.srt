00:00:00,970 --> 00:00:02,830
Hello Freak bitches.

2
00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:05,920
So you've got to quash
sex because the and,

3
00:00:06,250 --> 00:00:10,290
and gluttony because those are reminders
that were just primates for meanwhile

4
00:00:10,300 --> 00:00:11,620
the depictions of God,

5
00:00:11,621 --> 00:00:12,550
he's always ripped.

6
00:00:12,940 --> 00:00:13,773
He's always,

7
00:00:13,930 --> 00:00:16,030
he's always wearing a
robe cause he's modest.

8
00:00:16,390 --> 00:00:18,370
He's reaching over and touching people.

9
00:00:18,371 --> 00:00:19,001
His fingers go,

10
00:00:19,001 --> 00:00:20,890
he's got giant traps and what's great,

11
00:00:21,310 --> 00:00:21,820
it's true.

12
00:00:21,820 --> 00:00:23,380
God looks awesome as his son.

13
00:00:23,381 --> 00:00:25,930
It sounds looking sons
on great on the Cross,

14
00:00:25,931 --> 00:00:30,931
beaten to death half and he's got abs
and really watch for a guy who was for a

15
00:00:31,211 --> 00:00:31,400
guy,

16
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:33,310
was living in the Middle
East 2000 years ago,

17
00:00:33,430 --> 00:00:34,630
but skin bronze,

18
00:00:34,631 --> 00:00:37,300
hair of wool bullshit.

19
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:38,140
They uh,

20
00:00:38,140 --> 00:00:39,850
the other possibility of a black planet,

21
00:00:40,150 --> 00:00:40,990
Chuck d was right.

22
00:00:41,330 --> 00:00:42,490
Degas that look at that.

23
00:00:42,550 --> 00:00:43,720
But God beautiful.

24
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:46,590
The dude on the left hind
a little dot on the dude.

25
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:47,793
That's what I'm saying.

26
00:00:48,150 --> 00:00:48,670
Not even,

27
00:00:48,670 --> 00:00:48,941
I mean,

28
00:00:48,941 --> 00:00:49,774
why even draw it?

29
00:00:49,780 --> 00:00:51,940
You might as well just make
him an alien with no genitals.

30
00:00:51,970 --> 00:00:53,920
People back then just had little or dicks.

31
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:54,993
Is that possible?

32
00:00:55,720 --> 00:00:56,411
It's possible,

33
00:00:56,411 --> 00:01:00,300
but I've always just assumed that that
it's the modesty of the artists like it.

34
00:01:00,340 --> 00:01:05,080
It kind of changed the frame of the
picture of God reaching down and touching

35
00:01:05,081 --> 00:01:05,710
men.

36
00:01:05,710 --> 00:01:08,740
If men had a massive schlong
just hanging down his leg.

37
00:01:08,770 --> 00:01:08,981
Yeah,

38
00:01:08,981 --> 00:01:11,980
it would be distracting if you're
just giant John Holmes hard,

39
00:01:12,700 --> 00:01:15,130
but look how big the
muscles are in these guys.

40
00:01:15,131 --> 00:01:20,131
Like these guys have to be
fucking crossfitting all
day as well as being divine.

41
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:20,831
I mean,

42
00:01:20,831 --> 00:01:23,990
that guy on the left is doing
a lot of fucking weightlifting.

43
00:01:24,030 --> 00:01:28,480
There is not a regular body that's a body
of someone who's picking up heavy shit

44
00:01:28,481 --> 00:01:29,310
all day long,

45
00:01:29,310 --> 00:01:30,310
but he's got a skinny neck.

46
00:01:30,311 --> 00:01:31,360
I bet he's never been choked.

47
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:32,433
Maybes and act.

48
00:01:33,670 --> 00:01:35,920
That's not a guy who knows
how to cut out of a choke.

49
00:01:36,070 --> 00:01:38,080
No Little Dick Skinny neck,

50
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:40,090
but giant fucking biceps.

51
00:01:40,091 --> 00:01:41,140
Leave his forearms.

52
00:01:41,170 --> 00:01:42,003
It does a lot of,

53
00:01:42,010 --> 00:01:43,660
there's a lot of weightlifting for sure.

54
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:47,650
Michelangelo's ceiling of the Sistine
Chapel and look at the bizarre image of

55
00:01:47,651 --> 00:01:49,930
God being supported by Cherubs.

56
00:01:50,990 --> 00:01:52,860
How weird people are religion it.

57
00:01:52,940 --> 00:01:53,950
See got Dick though.

58
00:01:53,951 --> 00:01:54,670
Notice that.

59
00:01:54,670 --> 00:01:55,120
Nope,

60
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:58,630
he's got a robot and then other
dummy showing his little tiny dick.

61
00:01:58,870 --> 00:01:59,800
God looks kind of,

62
00:01:59,801 --> 00:02:01,240
I haven't really noticed this before,

63
00:02:01,241 --> 00:02:04,480
but God on the ceiling of the Sistine
Chapel looks a bit like Meryl Streep,

64
00:02:11,110 --> 00:02:14,440
Meryl Streep with a bead cause I think
he's kind of got breasts and he's,

65
00:02:14,441 --> 00:02:16,210
he's wearing like a nice white robe

66
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:17,081
now.

67
00:02:17,081 --> 00:02:18,370
It's to a guy like you,

68
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:21,340
Google auto drive cars
have to be the devil.

69
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:21,940
Yes.

70
00:02:21,940 --> 00:02:22,720
That's the devil.

71
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:23,553
It is.

72
00:02:23,590 --> 00:02:24,430
What's going to happen?

73
00:02:24,460 --> 00:02:24,970
Are we going to,

74
00:02:24,970 --> 00:02:27,280
we're going to not be able to
drive our own cars in the future.

75
00:02:27,310 --> 00:02:28,330
Is that a possibility?

76
00:02:28,420 --> 00:02:28,751
You know,

77
00:02:28,751 --> 00:02:32,570
I've been thinking long and hard about
that and it's been something that um,

78
00:02:33,190 --> 00:02:34,640
different people and um,

79
00:02:35,710 --> 00:02:39,820
my sub culture have openly been
concerned and discussing and there's many

80
00:02:39,821 --> 00:02:40,840
different takes on it.

81
00:02:41,290 --> 00:02:43,150
But I think I'm pretty centered on it.

82
00:02:43,180 --> 00:02:48,010
I think actually it's a positive thing
and that Carl is like the Prius and

83
00:02:48,011 --> 00:02:48,550
stuff,

84
00:02:48,550 --> 00:02:49,001
you know,

85
00:02:49,001 --> 00:02:53,200
started the generation where people
don't have an emotional relationship with

86
00:02:53,201 --> 00:02:53,771
their vehicle.

87
00:02:53,771 --> 00:02:54,371
It's a tool.

88
00:02:54,371 --> 00:02:56,710
It's literally like an APP on your phone.

89
00:02:56,960 --> 00:03:00,580
It gets you from a to B or
even more dispassionately,

90
00:03:00,581 --> 00:03:01,121
screw it.

91
00:03:01,121 --> 00:03:03,040
You Uber around and you don't care.

92
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:04,630
You don't have that relationship.

93
00:03:05,110 --> 00:03:09,550
So I think culturally as
autonomous vehicles and all
that continued to grow and

94
00:03:09,551 --> 00:03:10,001
evolve,

95
00:03:10,001 --> 00:03:13,590
you are going to see them eventually
become predominant and I think we're going

96
00:03:13,591 --> 00:03:18,591
to start to see lobbying
and federal support of that
direction because there's a

97
00:03:19,421 --> 00:03:21,190
lot of rational reasons behind it.

98
00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:22,720
That being said,

99
00:03:22,721 --> 00:03:27,160
I think it will further strengthen the
demand for the freaks and the Geeks,

100
00:03:27,940 --> 00:03:32,940
the outliers such as my brand because
people are going to yearn for that

101
00:03:34,210 --> 00:03:34,961
relationship,

102
00:03:34,961 --> 00:03:35,794
that attachment,

103
00:03:36,310 --> 00:03:37,930
and I think there's
always going to be people,

104
00:03:37,931 --> 00:03:41,120
even the guy who's got the
autonomous Mercedes at that,

105
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:41,741
his computer,

106
00:03:41,741 --> 00:03:42,550
but on the week it's like,

107
00:03:42,550 --> 00:03:43,031
oh no,

108
00:03:43,031 --> 00:03:43,870
I mean this thing's got a,

109
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:46,360
it's called a manual
transmission and there's,

110
00:03:46,390 --> 00:03:46,990
there's,

111
00:03:46,990 --> 00:03:48,220
there's pedals by the way,

112
00:03:48,221 --> 00:03:51,520
and there's three of those pedals and
you have to push that one down to get it

113
00:03:51,530 --> 00:03:52,070
too.

114
00:03:52,070 --> 00:03:52,420
But you know,

115
00:03:52,420 --> 00:03:53,051
I think there,

116
00:03:53,051 --> 00:03:58,051
there's that visceral relationship that
is always going to be part of mankind

117
00:03:59,860 --> 00:04:01,450
and I'm not worried about it.

118
00:04:01,670 --> 00:04:03,640
If I was trying to
start a big car company,

119
00:04:03,641 --> 00:04:04,870
then I would be worried about it.

120
00:04:06,090 --> 00:04:06,640
This is,

121
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:10,150
this is difficult thought
and is a difficult subject,

122
00:04:10,151 --> 00:04:12,040
but did you,

123
00:04:12,490 --> 00:04:17,300
after this was all said and done
a horrendous moment in your life,

124
00:04:17,330 --> 00:04:18,710
many moments in your life,

125
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:23,920
did you try to figure out what would
create a person like the guy who did that

126
00:04:24,261 --> 00:04:24,920
to you?

127
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:26,870
Did you try how much time?

128
00:04:27,230 --> 00:04:27,680
Yeah,

129
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:28,910
and I can tell you what created him.

130
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:31,130
He was taken out of an abusive home.

131
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:37,120
He was put into foster care and abused
many more times and he was gone and he

132
00:04:38,091 --> 00:04:43,091
was gone and it was gone
and he was succumbed by the
agony I was put through by

133
00:04:43,851 --> 00:04:44,540
him.

134
00:04:44,540 --> 00:04:45,470
I survived.

135
00:04:45,471 --> 00:04:48,290
Somehow I made it so call me lucky.

136
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:49,071
I'm not,

137
00:04:49,071 --> 00:04:50,030
I didn't become him.

138
00:04:50,031 --> 00:04:51,590
I didn't become what I resisted.

139
00:04:51,591 --> 00:04:52,424
I didn't,

140
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:54,260
I didn't pass along the poison.

141
00:04:54,470 --> 00:04:57,890
Maybe I did in some ways when
I was difficult or whatever,

142
00:04:58,070 --> 00:04:59,240
but mostly I didn't.

143
00:04:59,420 --> 00:05:00,710
Mostly when I'm mad,

144
00:05:00,711 --> 00:05:02,870
I'm mad because it's like Hendrix,

145
00:05:02,950 --> 00:05:04,010
a cry of love.

146
00:05:04,250 --> 00:05:06,020
It's a cry of love that I make.

147
00:05:06,021 --> 00:05:06,980
It's a cry of love.

148
00:05:06,981 --> 00:05:08,210
My Act has been a cry of love.

149
00:05:08,211 --> 00:05:11,450
It's like I don't want
the innocent hurt anymore.

150
00:05:11,451 --> 00:05:16,451
I don't want people victimized because
of greed and cower to some bullshit,

151
00:05:16,820 --> 00:05:17,091
you know?

152
00:05:17,091 --> 00:05:18,200
I don't want that.

153
00:05:18,410 --> 00:05:18,941
And so I,

154
00:05:18,941 --> 00:05:21,500
I do what I can to stand up to it to,

155
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:23,960
were there moments where
you wanted to talk to him?

156
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:25,850
What do you want to talk to him?

157
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:27,890
I would love to talk to him
to show him that I'd been,

158
00:05:27,970 --> 00:05:29,630
didn't become a monster like he was.

159
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:31,130
I W I would have,

160
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:34,790
I would have almost become an advocate
for him in the sense that like,

161
00:05:34,791 --> 00:05:35,250
well mate,

162
00:05:35,250 --> 00:05:37,220
you let me know if they're
mistreating you in here.

163
00:05:37,670 --> 00:05:38,780
But he died in prison.

164
00:05:38,781 --> 00:05:41,480
No one claimed his body and I
don't know where his grave is.

165
00:05:41,481 --> 00:05:42,291
If I knew her as grave,

166
00:05:42,291 --> 00:05:43,820
it was like go put fucking flowers on it.

167
00:05:43,821 --> 00:05:44,520
Not for him.

168
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:45,353
For me.

169
00:05:45,540 --> 00:05:50,540
So the Solomon asch conformity study
was framed to people coming into it as a

170
00:05:52,021 --> 00:05:54,120
visual perception experiment.

171
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:55,111
Basically,

172
00:05:55,111 --> 00:05:58,850
they'd be brought into a room with
several people in a semi circle

173
00:05:58,910 --> 00:06:03,910
and there'll be a person in the front
with a card with four lines on it,

174
00:06:04,610 --> 00:06:05,900
a sample line,

175
00:06:06,260 --> 00:06:09,500
and then three other
lines of different sizes.

176
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:10,731
Okay,

177
00:06:10,731 --> 00:06:12,740
let's say a three and simple line,

178
00:06:12,741 --> 00:06:14,630
a three inch or four inch and a five inch,

179
00:06:15,350 --> 00:06:20,350
but everyone is in on the experiment
except the person and seat six and after

180
00:06:20,721 --> 00:06:23,480
going around twice giving
the correct answer,

181
00:06:23,481 --> 00:06:27,740
everyone confidently starts
giving the wrong same answer.

182
00:06:28,250 --> 00:06:33,250
And the test is how many people will
start to conform to giving the wrong

183
00:06:33,471 --> 00:06:34,070
answer,

184
00:06:34,070 --> 00:06:36,470
even though they can
see what their own eyes,

185
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:38,330
what the correct answer is.

186
00:06:39,140 --> 00:06:44,140
And that study's been replicated thousands
of times and the answer is two thirds

187
00:06:44,421 --> 00:06:49,421
start giving the wrong answer even though
they know intellectually that it's the

188
00:06:49,821 --> 00:06:54,590
wrong answer because it feels too
uncomfortable to be in the room.

189
00:06:54,990 --> 00:06:55,610
And is that the,

190
00:06:55,610 --> 00:06:55,810
the,

191
00:06:55,810 --> 00:06:57,670
the testimony that they
give when they are asked,

192
00:06:57,690 --> 00:06:58,330
what did they,

193
00:06:58,330 --> 00:07:01,030
I'm sure assuming the interview
these people absolutely.

194
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:01,370
Yeah,

195
00:07:01,370 --> 00:07:05,510
I say it's uncomfortable and I even show
a date line and old dateline episode

196
00:07:05,511 --> 00:07:07,400
where they asked Anthony Pratt,

197
00:07:07,401 --> 00:07:11,390
Kansas is one of the foremost social
psychologists to to actually do the study

198
00:07:11,391 --> 00:07:12,980
so they could film it and this,

199
00:07:13,010 --> 00:07:18,010
they start out with this Asian woman who
is the her role at resistor who gives

200
00:07:19,251 --> 00:07:23,780
the correct answer but she's grimacing
and she's giving the wrong answer even

201
00:07:23,781 --> 00:07:25,640
though she knows it's the right answer.

202
00:07:25,850 --> 00:07:30,650
But because of the social forces
we are have mirror neurons,

203
00:07:30,651 --> 00:07:33,860
we want to fit in to
the people in the room.

204
00:07:33,861 --> 00:07:35,270
It's just human nature.

205
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:36,810
How people survive.

206
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:38,350
Exactly.

207
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:39,230
Clan behave.

208
00:07:39,260 --> 00:07:40,071
Exactly,

209
00:07:40,071 --> 00:07:41,330
but it's hard wired.

210
00:07:41,331 --> 00:07:46,331
So I showed that video
that that experiment and I
always like to ask people,

211
00:07:46,821 --> 00:07:47,880
so tell me a,

212
00:07:48,140 --> 00:07:52,850
something you could do if you were in
that situation to scientifically reality

213
00:07:52,851 --> 00:07:55,370
test that situation.

214
00:07:55,820 --> 00:07:59,000
Scientifically reality
testing meaning meaning one,

215
00:07:59,510 --> 00:08:00,650
you're in this room.

216
00:08:00,650 --> 00:08:03,920
Everyone's saying a five inch
line is a three inch line.

217
00:08:03,921 --> 00:08:05,240
What could you do?

218
00:08:05,450 --> 00:08:06,021
Let me ask you,

219
00:08:06,021 --> 00:08:06,621
what would you do?

220
00:08:06,621 --> 00:08:08,660
Because you have the data now.

221
00:08:08,661 --> 00:08:08,931
Okay,

222
00:08:08,931 --> 00:08:09,181
you're,

223
00:08:09,181 --> 00:08:10,430
you're a cult expert.

224
00:08:10,820 --> 00:08:12,590
You would get up and measure it.

225
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:13,220
Right?

226
00:08:13,220 --> 00:08:15,170
But you would have obviously
understand what's going on.

227
00:08:15,230 --> 00:08:16,010
Right,

228
00:08:16,010 --> 00:08:16,551
exactly.

229
00:08:16,551 --> 00:08:21,551
But if you asked me prior to my induction
into the moonies that I understand the

230
00:08:21,591 --> 00:08:24,050
asch conformity study or the power of B,

231
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:25,011
I would have said,

232
00:08:25,011 --> 00:08:25,251
no,

233
00:08:25,251 --> 00:08:26,210
I'm an individual.

234
00:08:27,070 --> 00:08:28,940
I'm a nonconformist.

235
00:08:28,941 --> 00:08:31,820
I had the bumper sticker
question authority,

236
00:08:32,100 --> 00:08:33,740
and I had the pony tail.

237
00:08:33,741 --> 00:08:35,830
And you know the word unique

238
00:08:37,910 --> 00:08:39,560
fit right in you rebel

239
00:08:44,750 --> 00:08:47,120
[inaudible].
